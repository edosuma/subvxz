00:11.673 --> 00:13.540
I'm so sorry my husband's late,
Mr. Stone.

00:13.641 --> 00:15.742
I hope this doesn't
cost me the promotion.

00:18.313 --> 00:20.814
- Sorry.
- Oh, here we are.

00:20.915 --> 00:23.624
Sorry. I haven't been feeling well.

00:23.929 --> 00:25.786
My lunch didn't quite
agree with me today.

00:25.887 --> 00:29.189
Great. Shows up late
and brings up food poisoning.

00:29.290 --> 00:31.792
Bon appÃ©tit, everyone.

00:33.531 --> 00:35.432
This is very important to me.

00:35.525 --> 00:37.759
Be charming and stop sweating.

00:40.286 --> 00:42.854
So, Frederick,
I hear you're quite the golfer.

00:42.956 --> 00:44.441
You should come and play
at my club sometime.

00:44.465 --> 00:47.415
Oh, that would be...

00:47.859 --> 00:50.468
He'd love that. Right, Frederick?

00:50.469 --> 00:52.331
Frederick?

00:53.866 --> 00:56.001
You're ruining their tablecloth.

00:56.102 --> 00:57.972
I think we need to leave.

00:57.973 --> 00:58.805
Are you all right?

00:58.806 --> 01:01.315
He's fine.
Tell 'em you're fine, Frederick.

01:01.317 --> 01:02.691
Tell her you're fine.

01:03.066 --> 01:03.998
Frederick!

01:07.455 --> 01:09.262
Oh! Oh!

01:09.263 --> 01:10.684
Oh, my God.

01:10.904 --> 01:11.970
Did I vomit on your boss?

01:12.072 --> 01:14.006
You are so unbelievably selfish.

01:14.107 --> 01:16.208
I knew you didn't want me
going back to work.

Dad.

01:29.961 --> 01:32.660
Dad, it's me, Angie.

01:35.063 --> 01:37.865
Well, I'll be a moose's knuckle!

01:37.966 --> 01:39.967
Come on in here.

01:43.808 --> 01:45.506
You have your mother's slurp.

01:48.596 --> 01:50.244
You must have a lot of questions.

01:51.013 --> 01:52.414
You left me alone.

01:52.515 --> 01:55.018
A 12-year-old girl without a father.

01:57.671 --> 01:59.027
Just tell me why.

02:00.523 --> 02:01.656
It's a long story,

02:02.393 --> 02:04.059
so I better hit the restroom first.

02:07.430 --> 02:08.763
Take your time.

02:09.245 --> 02:12.097
We're gonna be spending
lots of time together.

02:30.953 --> 02:33.054
Hey, Dad, want to go get some pie,

02:33.155 --> 02:34.923
see if I still got it?

02:36.670 --> 02:37.839
Dad?

02:44.381 --> 02:45.214
Dad?

03:11.861 --> 03:13.695
What is this, hazmat suit day?

03:13.796 --> 03:15.897
I guess I didn't get the memo.

03:15.998 --> 03:18.400
You're looking at what's left
of Dr. Frederick Curtis.

03:18.501 --> 03:21.169
He appears to have died of
some sort of hemorrhagic fever

03:21.270 --> 03:23.271
that liquefied his internal organs.

03:23.372 --> 03:24.706
Is it contagious?

03:24.807 --> 03:28.109
Yes. That's why I sent you
the memo about the hazmat suit.

03:28.753 --> 03:31.146
Don't worry about me. I never get sick.

03:31.941 --> 03:33.481
What is that, his wallet?

03:33.582 --> 03:36.718
Whoa, Defense Department.

03:36.819 --> 03:38.541
Bioweapons division.

03:39.161 --> 03:41.893
From the looks of it, he had
a hell of a parking space.

03:41.956 --> 03:45.517
Aren't those the guys that work with
the killer viruses and whatnot?

03:45.761 --> 03:49.130
Well, whatever this virus is,
it's 100% lethal,

03:49.231 --> 03:50.498
and if there's been an outbreak,

03:50.599 --> 03:53.301
that means the entire city's
in grave danger.

03:55.137 --> 03:57.238
Better get this to the lieutenant.

04:01.177 --> 04:03.945
Quarantine?! Have you lost your marbles?

04:04.046 --> 04:05.347
I have not!

04:05.448 --> 04:07.949
Everyone who has ever
exchanged fluids with Curtis

04:08.050 --> 04:09.784
is exchanging fluids with everyone

04:09.885 --> 04:11.653
he has ever exchanged fluids with!

04:11.754 --> 04:13.388
We need a quarantine to determine

04:13.489 --> 04:15.156
how far the virus has spread.

04:15.257 --> 04:16.958
- So we'll keep a condom on the city.
- Oh!

04:17.059 --> 04:18.660
Look, we can't afford a panic right now.

04:18.761 --> 04:22.130
It's Avocado Fest, which brings
in 80% of the city's revenue.

04:22.231 --> 04:24.602
Like it or not,
Los Angeles is a guac economy.

04:24.610 --> 04:27.240
- Geils, have you called the CDC?
- They called us.

04:27.450 --> 04:29.754
Apparently, there was a break-in
at the bioweapons division

04:29.755 --> 04:31.473
where Curtis worked a couple days ago.

04:31.557 --> 04:33.447
Someone made off
with multiple viral samples,

04:33.448 --> 04:35.939
a T. Rex embryo, and $40 in petty cash.

04:35.940 --> 04:37.664
Well, that cash is as good as gone.

04:37.671 --> 04:39.242
I don't know if it's linked
to Curtis's death,

04:39.243 --> 04:41.388
but it feels like the kind of
thing we'd investigate.

04:41.389 --> 04:45.294
Atkins, for God sakes, this city
has finally snapped back

04:45.295 --> 04:47.513
from the Mexican-American war.

04:47.514 --> 04:48.463
Don't do this.

04:48.464 --> 04:50.097
This could be a bioweapon.

04:50.895 --> 04:52.547
People dropping dead right and left.

04:52.548 --> 04:56.378
We're talking
Chipotle-level destruction.

04:56.479 --> 04:59.988
Allow me to spell this out
for you as plainly as possible.

04:59.995 --> 05:01.141
N-O...

05:01.531 --> 05:06.819
T-G-O-N-N-A-H-A-P-P-E-N.

05:12.240 --> 05:13.652
Where the hell is Tribeca?

05:13.653 --> 05:15.421
She's driving back from her story line,

05:15.572 --> 05:16.849
but I could give her a call.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.033
What's up, Geils?

05:50.698 --> 05:53.196
Oh, my God, that could
wipe out half the planet.

05:53.197 --> 05:55.934
And I'd bet my badge
Calvin Sniglet's behind this.

05:57.324 --> 06:00.375
Remember? The serial killer
who killed all the people

06:00.476 --> 06:03.607
and stole their clothes to make
little outfits for animals?

06:03.609 --> 06:05.075
Okay! I just didn't know
if you remembered.

06:06.083 --> 06:07.137
Oh, hang on.

06:08.635 --> 06:10.185
Speak of the devil.

06:10.286 --> 06:11.123
Sniglet.

06:11.124 --> 06:14.703
Detective Tribeca,
to what do I owe the pleasure?

06:14.704 --> 06:15.810
You called me.

06:15.811 --> 06:17.760
I figured out how to save the animals.

06:18.235 --> 06:19.345
By killing all the people.

06:19.346 --> 06:20.309
By killing...

06:21.521 --> 06:22.326
all the people.

06:22.327 --> 06:24.431
Calvin, you don't have to do this, okay?

06:24.432 --> 06:26.326
I am so sorry about your childhood,

06:26.327 --> 06:27.751
and trust me, I understand.

06:27.990 --> 06:30.992
But killing everyone on earth is
not gonna take that pain away.

06:31.093 --> 06:33.594
Just drop me a pin with your location.

06:33.695 --> 06:34.293
I'm sorry.

06:34.294 --> 06:36.161
I'm afraid I don't know how to do that.

06:36.262 --> 06:39.064
But did you know
that the human immune system

06:39.165 --> 06:42.067
can cause a spasmodic
contraction of 58 separate

06:42.168 --> 06:44.703
muscles in the face, neck, and thorax?

06:44.804 --> 06:47.560
You may know it as a sneeze.

06:47.611 --> 06:50.177
Hang on, sorry.
Dropped my phone in the crack.

06:52.077 --> 06:52.877
Okay.

06:52.978 --> 06:54.501
Sorry about that.

06:54.502 --> 06:56.369
Gesundheit, Tribeca.

07:04.712 --> 07:05.612
Ah-choo!

07:20.728 --> 07:21.767
Sorry.

07:25.230 --> 07:26.697
It's the biggest health scare

07:26.799 --> 07:29.743
since doctors said that thongs
should not be up there.

07:29.942 --> 07:32.977
Two are dead, and hundreds more
are starting to feel weird.

07:33.078 --> 07:35.055
Rumors are flying,
but we're having trouble

07:35.056 --> 07:37.415
getting any solid
information about the virus

07:37.516 --> 07:40.118
that seems to be spreading
quickly through the city.

07:41.028 --> 07:43.601
Here comes the mayor now
to give a statement.

07:50.629 --> 07:51.863
Thank you for coming.

07:51.964 --> 07:55.300
I'm pleased to announce
there is no cause for alarm.

07:55.401 --> 07:57.268
No quarantine will be in effect.

07:57.877 --> 08:00.605
And while we mourn those
that have become liquefied,

08:00.706 --> 08:02.307
the situation is under control.

08:02.864 --> 08:05.710
So go out your daily lives,
keep your loved ones close,

08:05.811 --> 08:08.338
just don't have any physical
contact with them.

08:19.274 --> 08:20.205
You should put one of these one.

08:20.205 --> 08:21.110
No, I'm good.

08:21.111 --> 08:22.443
I once ate a piece of raw chicken

08:22.544 --> 08:23.978
off a toilet seat
in a carnival port-a-potty

08:24.087 --> 08:25.415
and was sick for, like, three weeks,

08:25.416 --> 08:26.681
so I think I got this.

08:26.782 --> 08:27.559
Suit yourself.

08:27.684 --> 08:29.231
I just said I didn't want one.

08:29.232 --> 08:30.822
Can you zip me up?

08:39.995 --> 08:41.270
How'd things go with your dad?

08:41.272 --> 08:43.563
Let's just say
I've lost all faith in humanity

08:43.666 --> 08:45.318
and wouldn't mind if everyone just died,

08:45.319 --> 08:47.263
but it won't affect
my work on this case.

08:47.264 --> 08:50.204
Did we ever figure out how
Sniglet got access to this lab?

08:50.206 --> 08:51.473
You don't get it.

08:53.031 --> 08:55.439
Well, why don't you
explain it to us, Mister?

08:56.545 --> 08:57.478
Oh, sorry, Geils.

08:57.579 --> 08:59.180
This is Clive Mister from the CDC.

08:59.281 --> 09:00.754
It's actually Dr. Mister.

09:01.223 --> 09:03.418
We're dealing with a
level 16 viral outbreak.

09:03.519 --> 09:05.420
Kind of hard to tell
if that's good or bad

09:05.521 --> 09:07.655
without knowing how
many levels there are.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.123
Well, on a good-or-bad scale,

09:09.224 --> 09:10.990
I'd say we're looking at about a 90.

09:10.991 --> 09:12.254
So, a 90 is...?

09:12.255 --> 09:13.661
You don't get it.

09:13.762 --> 09:16.531
You're not even close to getting it.

09:17.599 --> 09:19.834
Let's go inside so I
can explain it to you,

09:19.935 --> 09:22.837
even though there's no
chance you're gonna get it.

09:44.663 --> 09:47.128
This is where Dr. Curtis worked.

09:47.229 --> 09:51.346
You're surrounded by some of the most
deadly viruses in human history.

09:52.201 --> 09:54.202
I don't see any signs of a break-in.

09:54.303 --> 09:56.537
Is it possible that
Curtis let Sniglet in?

09:57.027 --> 10:01.250
Oh, my God.
How are you not getting this?!

10:01.343 --> 10:03.450
Whoever got in here used a key card,

10:03.887 --> 10:05.209
and it wasn't Dr. Curtis'.

10:05.224 --> 10:06.954
That means Sniglet had his own key card

10:06.955 --> 10:08.025
and he let himself in

10:08.026 --> 10:10.666
and he knew exactly
what he was looking for.

10:12.354 --> 10:16.891
He went straight for what
we call the rare-wine cellar.

10:39.982 --> 10:42.786
Sniglet knew what time Curtis
would take his breaks,

10:43.398 --> 10:45.764
so that means
he'd been casing the place.

10:48.110 --> 10:50.992
Curtis was just in the wrong
place at the wrong time

10:51.108 --> 10:52.485
eating the wrong salad.

10:53.262 --> 10:54.919
So give it to us real.

10:55.251 --> 10:57.796
What is this virus,
and how fast can it spread?

10:57.797 --> 11:00.265
The virus originated in penguins.

11:01.015 --> 11:03.271
This penguin flu was then weaponized

11:03.372 --> 11:05.506
and introduced into a human environment.

11:05.607 --> 11:07.942
So, it's a highly contagious
biological weapon,

11:08.043 --> 11:09.877
some kind of synthesized penguin flu.

11:09.978 --> 11:11.746
So, if we can cure a penguin,

11:11.847 --> 11:14.346
we can figure out some way to apply it?

11:32.446 --> 11:34.299
A virus that causes
a sore throat in penguins

11:34.300 --> 11:35.566
makes the jump to humans,

11:35.667 --> 11:37.701
causing total liquefactive necrosis,

11:37.802 --> 11:41.271
which is a fancy way of saying
cytoplasmic protein coagulation.

11:41.373 --> 11:43.107
So, mankind turns to soup

11:43.208 --> 11:45.111
because of one lonely Arctic explorer

11:45.112 --> 11:47.150
and one incredibly sexy penguin?

11:47.151 --> 11:49.519
We should have melted
the ice caps a long time ago.

11:49.520 --> 11:51.980
Is there any way to slow
down the infection rate?

11:51.981 --> 11:54.588
Maybe keep it to 9,000 or 10,000 deaths?

11:54.589 --> 11:56.728
Right now, the virus
is moving from person to person

11:56.729 --> 11:58.069
through physical contact,

11:58.070 --> 12:00.624
but if it becomes
airborne, it's game over.

12:00.725 --> 12:02.926
Although, I've never played a game.

12:03.028 --> 12:04.682
Unless we can find a cure.

12:05.550 --> 12:06.707
Scholls, how long would it take you

12:06.708 --> 12:08.666
to develop an antidote to this thing?

12:08.681 --> 12:10.316
A little over a week,
but I lose the weekend

12:10.317 --> 12:12.638
because of my sister's
baby shower in Kalamazoo.

12:12.639 --> 12:14.490
I don't know.
Is humanity really worth it?

12:14.602 --> 12:16.226
I mean, is it really
the end of the world

12:16.227 --> 12:17.673
if it's the end of the world?

12:18.209 --> 12:20.344
Dibs on the antidote.

12:21.915 --> 12:22.637
It's him.

12:24.977 --> 12:26.190
Tribeca.

12:26.237 --> 12:28.396
Happy last day on earth.

12:28.397 --> 12:30.766
Hey, am I on speakerphone?
I hear an echo.

12:30.767 --> 12:32.396
Yeah, but there's no one in the room.

12:32.397 --> 12:34.925
Good thinking. Whoops.

12:35.026 --> 12:36.627
Doesn't matter.

12:36.728 --> 12:38.811
Soon, there'll be no one in any rooms.

12:38.813 --> 12:41.161
They'll all be dead because of me.

12:41.435 --> 12:42.904
You'll be dead, too, Sniglet.

12:42.905 --> 12:44.764
No one's immune to the penguin flu.

12:44.765 --> 12:46.890
Unless you've taken
the necessary precautions

12:46.891 --> 12:48.572
to make sure that doesn't happen.

12:48.673 --> 12:50.617
You're a madman. Tell me where you are.

12:50.618 --> 12:52.643
Doesn't matter where I am, Tribeca.

12:52.744 --> 12:55.512
What matters is where the
virus is about to be.

12:56.536 --> 12:57.915
Spring is in the air.

12:57.916 --> 13:00.442
You know what my favorite
thing about spring is?

13:00.931 --> 13:02.192
Opening day.

13:03.655 --> 13:04.609
Goodbye.

13:05.374 --> 13:06.329
Forever.

13:07.859 --> 13:09.608
Opening day...

13:10.295 --> 13:10.981
Baseball?

13:11.161 --> 13:13.663
Dodger Stadium.
Opening day is this afternoon.

13:13.664 --> 13:16.504
They're giving out nasal spray
to the first 10,000 fans.

13:16.505 --> 13:18.821
The perfect delivery
method for this virus.

13:18.822 --> 13:20.340
Geils, Tanner, get down to the stadium

13:20.341 --> 13:21.928
and confiscate that nasal spray.

13:21.929 --> 13:23.820
Tribeca, find Sniglet.

13:23.821 --> 13:25.509
Scholls, go do science stuff.

13:25.610 --> 13:27.277
Wiedner, did the wedding planner

13:27.378 --> 13:29.213
have any suggestions for appetizers?

13:29.314 --> 13:30.973
He's thinking maybe
a taco bar might be...

13:30.974 --> 13:32.915
Damn it, we're all
about to die, Wiedner!

13:32.916 --> 13:34.971
We're not having a taco bar!

13:36.893 --> 13:40.229
Can you tell me about
those mini cheeseburgers again?

13:42.428 --> 13:43.628
Tribeca.

13:43.988 --> 13:46.889
I hope you're not thinking
about trying to stop me.

13:47.022 --> 13:47.997
On the contrary.

13:47.998 --> 13:49.756
I was thinking I'd like to join you.

13:49.913 --> 13:50.779
Really?

13:52.066 --> 13:54.601
Well, maybe after everyone's gone,

13:54.702 --> 13:57.172
you and I could repopulate
the earth together.

14:00.154 --> 14:02.824
Or just grab a drink,
if that's too much too fast.

14:03.534 --> 14:05.445
Uhh, hang on.

14:05.546 --> 14:07.022
It's my brother on the other line.

14:07.023 --> 14:08.414
Can you hold on for one second?

14:08.415 --> 14:09.850
Yeah, no, no, no, take the call.

14:09.873 --> 14:10.961
Just call me later. It's no big deal.

14:10.962 --> 14:12.951
No, no, no, no. I want to talk to you.

14:13.264 --> 14:15.303
Just one second.

14:16.003 --> 14:17.838
All right, Scholls,
you're my eyes and ears.

14:17.839 --> 14:18.778
Where is he?

14:18.779 --> 14:21.047
Just downloading the data
from the satellite.

14:21.048 --> 14:22.296
Give me a minute.

14:22.297 --> 14:24.540
Hey, I'm back. Sorry about that.

14:25.087 --> 14:26.341
How about this?

14:26.342 --> 14:28.705
You tell me where you are,
and I'll come pick you up.

14:28.706 --> 14:31.995
That sounds nice. It's been very lonely.

14:32.674 --> 14:33.828
I know how you feel.

14:33.829 --> 14:35.982
I've been alone
since I was 12 years old.

14:35.983 --> 14:39.442
So, that was like 25 years ago?

14:39.969 --> 14:42.112
So that would make you...?

14:42.113 --> 14:44.900
Old enough to know
you can't outrun your past.

14:45.271 --> 14:46.960
Yeah. No, absolutely.

14:48.137 --> 14:50.422
What music was popular
back then? I forget.

14:50.423 --> 14:51.146
Like...

14:51.147 --> 14:54.310
You know, the usual.
Just songs about broken hearts.

14:54.531 --> 14:57.590
Did you have an Atari or...?

14:57.591 --> 15:00.879
People are cruel, Sniglet.
Parents are cruel.

15:00.880 --> 15:02.407
Parents are people.

15:02.408 --> 15:04.349
And people are animals.

15:05.728 --> 15:06.874
I'm sorry. I'm confused.

15:06.875 --> 15:08.224
Are we hooking up or what?

15:08.225 --> 15:10.469
Just tell me where.

15:10.540 --> 15:11.547
Hang on a second.

15:11.610 --> 15:13.111
Scholls, I'm running out of nonsense.

15:13.212 --> 15:14.105
Just give me something.

15:14.106 --> 15:15.185
Boom, got him.

15:16.069 --> 15:17.470
Oh.

15:17.844 --> 15:18.944
You're not gonna like this.

15:19.030 --> 15:20.660
For God sakes, just tell me!

15:22.740 --> 15:23.358
Oh!

15:32.865 --> 15:34.299
Hello, Angie.

15:35.568 --> 15:36.729
I've missed you.

15:37.255 --> 15:38.774
Have you missed me?

15:39.714 --> 15:42.277
Well, now there's plenty
of me to go around.

15:43.491 --> 15:45.473
But which one is the real me?

15:45.682 --> 15:48.017
Ow! God!

15:48.329 --> 15:49.255
Seriously?

15:49.255 --> 15:50.136
God!

15:55.688 --> 15:57.422
Welcome to opening day,

15:57.523 --> 15:58.923
brought to you by Snot-Block.

15:59.024 --> 16:01.092
Don't breathe through your mouth.

16:01.094 --> 16:02.461
Use Snot-Block.

16:03.362 --> 16:04.052
Puig!

16:04.138 --> 16:06.197
L.A.P.D. Where's the nasal spray?

16:09.368 --> 16:11.500
Oh, my God, this stuff is lethal.

16:11.501 --> 16:13.649
Let's get rid of it
and take it to Goodwill.

16:14.907 --> 16:18.481
Uhh, Geils? All these are empty.

16:21.246 --> 16:22.647
We're too late.

16:37.869 --> 16:39.797
I can breathe again!

16:39.898 --> 16:41.332
Too bad I'ma die.

16:46.231 --> 16:47.732
I don't feel sick!

16:47.833 --> 16:49.567
I should be out there
trying to catch this guy.

16:49.668 --> 16:50.935
Look, it's just a precaution.

16:51.036 --> 16:52.236
You probably don't have it.

16:52.337 --> 16:53.604
Although, they say
once the symptoms start,

16:53.705 --> 16:55.339
it's already too...

16:57.918 --> 16:59.352
Oh, no.

16:59.845 --> 17:00.839
You're gonna be okay.

17:05.284 --> 17:07.550
Scholls is working on an
antidote as we speak.

17:07.653 --> 17:09.619
You...

17:09.721 --> 17:11.589
can...

17:11.690 --> 17:13.758
beat...

17:13.858 --> 17:15.660
this.

17:20.365 --> 17:22.599
Hang in there, buddy.

17:33.111 --> 17:34.779
I know.

17:39.998 --> 17:42.130
I was able to isolate
the pathogenic proteins

17:42.131 --> 17:44.414
and deactivate them
by grafting on autoimmune genes

17:44.415 --> 17:45.810
from penguin DNA.

17:45.811 --> 17:47.478
Good work, Scholls.

17:49.875 --> 17:52.268
Let's get the rest of
this stuff to the public.

17:52.570 --> 17:54.279
That was over 4,000 doses.

17:54.380 --> 17:56.781
It's gonna take me 24 hours
to brew the next batch.

17:56.882 --> 17:58.931
Tanner doesn't have that kind of time!

17:58.932 --> 18:00.475
Well, obviously, the more
penguin blood I have,

18:00.476 --> 18:02.314
the faster I can make more antidote.

18:02.377 --> 18:04.666
We're going to need
every penguin in the city.

18:05.558 --> 18:08.159
Let's hear it for Penny the Penguin!

18:55.441 --> 18:56.374
Ah!

18:56.475 --> 18:58.109
Ah!

19:16.729 --> 19:19.377
I'm pleased to announce
the penguin flu outbreak

19:19.466 --> 19:20.692
has been contained.

19:21.534 --> 19:25.036
You may all go back to your normal
lives of quiet desperation.

19:25.137 --> 19:27.815
Sounds great, Mr. Mayor.
The people are gonna love it.

19:27.816 --> 19:29.574
Atkins, I can't thank
you and your team enough

19:29.675 --> 19:31.109
for what you've done.

19:31.210 --> 19:34.312
It's just too bad Tanner
wasn't here to hear you say it.

19:36.182 --> 19:38.383
- These new floors look great.
- Gleaming.

19:38.484 --> 19:39.716
- Really.
- Really beautiful.

19:39.717 --> 19:40.985
Tanner, get in here!

19:42.355 --> 19:43.621
What's up?

19:43.723 --> 19:46.458
The mayor was just patting us
on the back for a job well done.

19:46.459 --> 19:49.761
Oh, the real hero is Dr. Scholls.

19:49.862 --> 19:51.196
Without that medicine,

19:51.297 --> 19:53.808
I'd just be another victim
of penguin flu.

19:58.771 --> 19:59.807
Where is Scholls?

19:59.808 --> 20:01.843
Anybody tell her to come upstairs?

20:16.408 --> 20:18.009
They'll find me!

20:18.156 --> 20:19.865
You won't get away with this!
