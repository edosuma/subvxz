00:54.471 --> 00:56.007
Hey, Gabe?

00:56.941 --> 00:58.808
It's freezing.

01:01.778 --> 01:04.015
What did you do,
leave the windows open?

01:05.248 --> 01:06.549
Gabe?

01:17.061 --> 01:18.762
Gabriel?

01:19.864 --> 01:21.098
Gabe?

01:24.601 --> 01:26.070
Hey, Gabe?

02:43.381 --> 02:44.848
Allery...

02:46.549 --> 02:48.651
I'll see you after work, okay?

02:49.920 --> 02:51.122
Yeah.

04:51.475 --> 04:55.479
<i>All employees please
report to production coordinator</i>

04:55.546 --> 04:56.514
<i>for payment processing...</i>

04:56.580 --> 04:58.215
Hey, Walter!

05:00.584 --> 05:01.886
What you waiting for, Walt?

05:01.952 --> 05:06.323
Not waiting on a thing,
I guess.

05:20.070 --> 05:22.039
C"mon, Brian, thought you had
these things organized.

05:22.106 --> 05:23.840
I'm sorry...
There's just a lot of...

05:23.908 --> 05:25.609
I'm sorry. Sorry.

05:25.675 --> 05:28.479
Make us put in half-a-day
just to collect our last check.

05:28.546 --> 05:30.047
Fuckin' bullshit,
you know that?

05:30.114 --> 05:33.050
I don't make
the policies, Benny.

05:33.117 --> 05:35.785
Nah, you just do
what they tell you.

05:37.388 --> 05:40.157
Look, I'm gonna be outta work same
as everybody else, okay, Mendez?

05:40.591 --> 05:41.791
Jesus.

05:41.859 --> 05:43.894
I'm not going
to miss that prick.

05:58.142 --> 06:00.843
Just give me a sec.
I'll meet you in the office, okay?

06:00.911 --> 06:02.279
All right.

06:06.217 --> 06:07.750
Allery!

06:07.817 --> 06:09.386
Hey, Parkes!

06:10.154 --> 06:11.754
Two o'clock is the same
as a full day!

06:11.821 --> 06:13.390
You're free to leave!

06:17.161 --> 06:18.929
Guy knows he's not
getting overtime, right?

06:18.996 --> 06:20.464
Yeah, he knows.

06:20.531 --> 06:22.499
Just been with the company
a long time is all.

06:22.566 --> 06:23.701
Understatement.

06:23.766 --> 06:25.102
The man looks old as dirt.

06:25.169 --> 06:26.537
Why'd you keep him on?

06:26.604 --> 06:28.906
He had his chance at retirement.
He never wanted it.

06:28.973 --> 06:30.941
That's too bad
for him now, isn't it?

06:31.008 --> 06:33.410
Maybe Wal-Mart's hiring.

06:33.477 --> 06:35.879
Just see that he's gone
when you lock up.

06:35.946 --> 06:39.149
Last thing the company needs is for some
broken-down geriatric to get left behind.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.068
They just tell us
three days before the shut down

08:38.135 --> 08:39.937
and didn't give us
dick for severance.

08:40.003 --> 08:41.238
Fuckin' criminals.

08:41.304 --> 08:43.240
We had more orders to fill.

08:44.041 --> 08:46.009
Now the place is fuckin' empty.

08:46.076 --> 08:49.713
And whatta they got but a warehouse
of raw material just sitting there.

08:49.780 --> 08:51.548
Nothing but
a fuckin' waste.

08:53.217 --> 08:55.719
What're you going to do, Walt?

08:55.786 --> 08:57.321
I don't know.

08:57.388 --> 08:58.589
Finish this here,

08:58.655 --> 09:01.258
then goin' inside
and make my supper.

09:01.325 --> 09:04.863
Those men there...
Are those cowboys again, Walt?

09:04.928 --> 09:07.131
Australian Light Horse Brigade.

09:07.197 --> 09:09.032
Birthday gift for my son.

09:09.099 --> 09:12.069
No, I mean what're
you gonna do? Your plans.

09:12.136 --> 09:13.103
I don't know.

09:13.170 --> 09:14.805
Haven't made my mind just yet.

09:14.873 --> 09:16.774
Well, shit,
you only been here but, what,

09:16.840 --> 09:18.242
eight-nine months?

09:18.308 --> 09:20.844
I'd pack up
and move on down the road.

09:21.912 --> 09:24.548
We got our whole lives
wrapped up in this damn town.

09:26.083 --> 09:28.719
Nah, if I was you, Walt,

09:28.786 --> 09:30.454
I'd get the fuck outta Dodge.

09:46.437 --> 09:48.071
Hm.

09:58.081 --> 10:00.217
Are you going
on your walk tonight?

10:01.385 --> 10:03.120
Yes.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.133
Allery?

10:52.169 --> 10:54.104
Allery, are you awake?

11:16.928 --> 11:19.096
I have my circle today.

11:19.663 --> 11:21.131
Then I have...

11:21.198 --> 11:23.166
grocery shopping.

11:24.201 --> 11:26.236
Your lunch is
in the refrigerator.

13:00.098 --> 13:01.765
Hey, don't bother.

13:01.832 --> 13:04.035
All they got in there is
temp work and a two-hour wait.

13:04.102 --> 13:06.303
Hell of a line for table scraps.

14:42.399 --> 14:44.568
Allery, what are you doing?

14:49.173 --> 14:50.908
I'm going to work.

15:12.629 --> 15:15.532
Hey, Allery,
where you goin', man?

15:17.400 --> 15:19.103
Looks like
he's going to work.

18:35.832 --> 18:37.667
I think he just
walked in, Bonnie.

18:37.734 --> 18:40.137
Please let me...
I'll call you back.

18:44.408 --> 18:46.643
Allery, thank goodness.

18:46.710 --> 18:48.745
Where have you been all day?

18:50.348 --> 18:51.949
I told you.
I went to work.

19:57.680 --> 19:59.450
- Allery?
- Hm?

19:59.517 --> 20:02.786
You didn't really go to
the factory today, did you?

20:06.090 --> 20:07.624
Iola.

20:07.690 --> 20:09.692
Have I ever lied to you?

20:13.931 --> 20:15.032
No.

20:29.480 --> 20:31.082
I'll be home for supper.

21:34.612 --> 21:36.247
I think I have that.

21:37.680 --> 21:38.648
What to do?

21:38.715 --> 21:39.749
Five. Five.

21:39.816 --> 21:41.285
There's one...

21:42.186 --> 21:43.820
Two...

21:46.723 --> 21:48.092
Three...

21:49.193 --> 21:50.628
four, five.

21:50.693 --> 21:52.163
Right?

22:32.702 --> 22:35.406
Hey, hey, look.
Here he comes.

22:35.472 --> 22:37.274
What did I tell you, guys?
Didn't I tell you?

22:37.341 --> 22:38.909
Hey, Parkes!

22:39.742 --> 22:41.378
What do ya think
you're doin'?

22:41.711 --> 22:43.080
Allery!

22:43.147 --> 22:46.217
Hey, Allery!
Where you been all day, man?

22:46.283 --> 22:47.817
Just 'cause you
dress up for work,

22:47.885 --> 22:49.887
doesn't mean
they're gonna pay ya!

22:57.727 --> 22:59.897
Is everything
all right, Allery?

22:59.964 --> 23:01.865
Yes. Everything's fine.

23:04.134 --> 23:05.703
But then why are
you doing this?

23:05.768 --> 23:08.138
The factory...
I don't understand...

23:10.908 --> 23:12.409
It's, uh...

23:12.476 --> 23:15.045
It's just something
I need to do.

23:15.812 --> 23:17.281
Hm.

23:38.168 --> 23:39.802
Look it, there he is.

23:39.870 --> 23:41.405
He's gonna do it again.

23:42.072 --> 23:44.108
Now just what the hell?

23:47.711 --> 23:49.079
Man's not all there.

23:49.146 --> 23:51.949
He's gonna go off,
he's gonna lose it.

23:54.685 --> 23:56.186
Time bomb.

24:02.825 --> 24:04.328
I'll be damned.

24:30.820 --> 24:32.289
I'll get it.

25:00.751 --> 25:02.353
So, Allery...

25:02.886 --> 25:04.455
How are you?

25:06.490 --> 25:07.758
I'm fine.

25:07.825 --> 25:09.693
Good, good.

25:09.760 --> 25:10.794
Good.

25:10.861 --> 25:12.463
I'm very pleased to hear that.

25:14.898 --> 25:16.400
Good.

25:18.702 --> 25:20.070
You know,

25:20.137 --> 25:22.506
we're living in very
uncertain times.

25:23.240 --> 25:25.275
The factory closing...

25:26.777 --> 25:28.912
I know for many folks,

25:28.979 --> 25:31.281
plastics was the very heart
of this town.

25:33.050 --> 25:35.519
So, I don't think
you're alone...

25:36.053 --> 25:37.287
in facing...

25:37.354 --> 25:38.555
Excuse me.

25:39.523 --> 25:41.125
I'm sorry? Come again?

25:42.126 --> 25:43.994
I said, will you
excuse me for a moment?

25:44.061 --> 25:46.196
Oh, yes, of course.

26:22.733 --> 26:24.268
Thanks again for
helping me out, Walter.

26:24.334 --> 26:25.803
I really appreciate it.

26:25.870 --> 26:28.238
It's hell being married
to a bargain shopper.

26:28.305 --> 26:31.041
She makes me buy shit
we don't even need.

26:42.019 --> 26:43.520
He had a son, you know?

26:45.823 --> 26:47.758
No.

26:47.825 --> 26:49.226
I didn't know that.

26:49.861 --> 26:51.295
It was the only child.

26:51.361 --> 26:54.731
Had to be in his 30s...
Maybe a little older.

26:54.798 --> 26:56.800
Couldn't hold a job cause
of his behavior.

26:56.868 --> 26:58.702
He was real smart,
but he just...

26:58.769 --> 27:01.538
He had a lot of problems up
here, you know what I mean?

27:47.451 --> 27:50.020
Are you sure you don't
want some breakfast?

27:50.087 --> 27:51.688
I could make you eggs.

27:54.391 --> 27:55.492
No.

27:57.027 --> 27:58.897
No.

27:58.963 --> 28:00.430
I don't care for any.

28:01.231 --> 28:03.634
Allery, I'm so sorry
I called Pastor Mark.

28:03.700 --> 28:05.970
I just thought you might
like to talk to him...

28:06.036 --> 28:08.405
to someone...

28:11.074 --> 28:12.709
You should get that.

28:20.517 --> 28:21.818
Hello?

28:21.886 --> 28:23.021
Bonnie?

28:23.086 --> 28:24.288
Oh!

28:24.354 --> 28:27.124
The charity drive!
I completely forgot.

28:29.259 --> 28:31.029
Do you still need blankets?

28:31.094 --> 28:32.563
Allery?

28:42.072 --> 28:43.473
Okay.

29:32.656 --> 29:33.790
Oh.

30:08.325 --> 30:10.293
Allery.

30:12.262 --> 30:13.764
How you doin'?

30:18.535 --> 30:20.437
Everything all right there?

30:21.738 --> 30:23.340
I'm okay.

30:26.476 --> 30:28.445
Allery, we can't
have you in here.

30:29.212 --> 30:30.714
We just can't.

30:44.361 --> 30:46.130
Hey, check the scanner.
Check it for me.

30:46.196 --> 30:47.497
Sure.

30:57.374 --> 30:59.543
They shouldn't bring
a man like that home.

31:00.277 --> 31:01.445
That ain't where he belongs.

31:07.350 --> 31:08.752
Mr. Parkes.

31:10.520 --> 31:12.689
I don't wanna have
to do this again.

31:26.369 --> 31:28.072
Oh, you're back.

31:28.139 --> 31:29.806
That's a nice surprise...

31:53.463 --> 31:55.465
Allery.

31:57.300 --> 31:59.803
Allery, someone's
at the back door.

32:12.449 --> 32:14.417
You want in that factory?

32:17.287 --> 32:18.856
I'll get ya in there.

32:20.191 --> 32:21.859
Ain't nobody got to know,
neither.

32:57.594 --> 32:59.563
Gordman gave me
this spare set of masters

32:59.629 --> 33:02.465
when we was makin' them
window latches back in August.

33:02.967 --> 33:04.701
He forgot he done it.

33:08.738 --> 33:10.674
And I didn't bother
to remind him.

33:48.179 --> 33:51.282
Is that what you've
been doing in here? Cleanin'?

33:51.349 --> 33:52.716
Why ain't ya fired one up yet?

33:52.782 --> 33:54.218
Ain't nobody gonna
hear you in here.

33:54.285 --> 33:55.752
No power.

33:57.687 --> 33:59.290
- You tried the breakers?
- Yeah.

34:23.580 --> 34:25.049
Line's connected!

34:43.766 --> 34:46.536
<i>Department of Water and Power?</i>

34:46.603 --> 34:48.239
Yes, this is Stan Gordman,

34:48.306 --> 34:49.773
New Liberty Plastics.

34:50.774 --> 34:52.574
We shut down operations
here at the factory,

34:52.641 --> 34:54.643
the one off Clayton Road.

34:54.710 --> 34:58.182
Thing is, I still got a bunch of
folks trying to perform maintenance,

34:58.249 --> 35:00.483
- but we got no electricity.
- <i>Oh, well...</i>

35:00.550 --> 35:02.819
Bonnie,
it's so nice of you

35:02.887 --> 35:04.688
to come by for the donations,

35:04.754 --> 35:06.489
I just couldn't
leave the house.

35:06.556 --> 35:08.859
Well, I got the blanket...

35:09.759 --> 35:11.996
Iola, I heard about Allery.

35:13.630 --> 35:15.099
Are you okay?

35:26.509 --> 35:28.145
Thought you might have
lit out on me.

35:31.581 --> 35:33.150
Break time, I see.

35:34.551 --> 35:36.653
Suppose I oughta have me
a little break myself.

35:46.864 --> 35:48.798
I didn't pack nothin'.

35:50.368 --> 35:51.969
Go ahead, I'll be fine.

36:10.587 --> 36:12.023
Much obliged.

36:12.756 --> 36:14.892
- Thank you.
- Hm-hm.

36:16.559 --> 36:19.696
Things were different
way back then.

36:20.697 --> 36:22.699
Before Gabe got sick.

36:24.502 --> 36:27.637
Allery use to come home
from work, we'd get a sitter,

36:27.704 --> 36:29.373
and we'd go over to Tipton,

36:29.440 --> 36:30.640
it's a supper club
out there.

36:30.707 --> 36:32.642
- The Starliter.
- Hmm.

36:32.709 --> 36:35.645
Yep. I remember they used
to serve peas and potatoes.

36:35.712 --> 36:37.714
It was in their Mexican food.

36:37.781 --> 36:39.649
It's all Mexican
food over there now.

36:39.716 --> 36:40.985
There was also dancing.

36:41.052 --> 36:43.387
Three times a week
and the weekends.

36:43.454 --> 36:44.522
We'd go there all the time.

36:44.587 --> 36:45.990
You and Allery?

36:46.057 --> 36:47.191
Yeah.

36:47.258 --> 36:49.659
Oh, I know he doesn't
look like it now, but...

36:49.726 --> 36:51.862
back then he was
light on his feet.

36:51.929 --> 36:54.798
I was terrible.

36:54.865 --> 36:56.967
He was a wonderful lead.

37:04.607 --> 37:06.010
Your voice.

37:07.478 --> 37:08.645
It's different.

37:08.711 --> 37:10.647
You know that?

37:11.882 --> 37:14.251
I been working aside you now,
what, eight months,

37:15.618 --> 37:17.720
and 'til today,
I ain't never heard you talk.

37:18.856 --> 37:20.424
Now, when I hear you,

37:20.491 --> 37:22.960
the voice don't match the face.

37:24.495 --> 37:25.829
Not a bad thing,

37:25.896 --> 37:28.099
just not what I expected,
is all.

37:38.842 --> 37:40.777
Look at that, huh?

37:41.811 --> 37:43.713
Look at that.

37:44.781 --> 37:47.684
The way he held me close...

37:48.818 --> 37:50.687
It was perfect.

37:52.056 --> 37:53.257
But now...

37:54.258 --> 37:55.893
It's like...

37:56.659 --> 37:58.828
he forgot all the steps.

37:58.896 --> 38:00.730
And I don't know
what move he's gonna make next.

38:00.797 --> 38:03.267
Thinks he's...

38:03.334 --> 38:05.668
He's just not
the man I married.

38:05.735 --> 38:07.138
Oh.

38:07.204 --> 38:08.973
They never are.

38:19.049 --> 38:22.319
These machines here
are built for use,

38:22.386 --> 38:24.622
not to shine up like
some rich man's show car.

38:38.835 --> 38:40.803
We came here to work!

38:43.706 --> 38:45.176
Let's go to work!

38:47.878 --> 38:49.346
You're staying?

38:52.216 --> 38:54.251
Liverwurst, huh?

38:54.318 --> 38:55.785
It's braunschweiger.

38:55.853 --> 38:57.922
Didn't know they still
made this stuff.

39:02.593 --> 39:04.328
What do you want?

39:05.728 --> 39:07.064
Ain't my place to be picky.

39:07.131 --> 39:09.066
Beggars can't be choosers.

39:09.600 --> 39:10.634
No.

39:10.700 --> 39:12.269
Why are you here?

39:14.972 --> 39:16.907
Same thing as you, I imagine.

39:18.876 --> 39:20.810
Where else we got to go?

39:39.997 --> 39:41.831
That was the best day of work

39:41.899 --> 39:44.001
I've had in a long, damn time.

39:47.671 --> 39:49.106
How 'bout tomorrow?

40:02.653 --> 40:04.521
The man who came
here this morning...

40:04.588 --> 40:06.257
the man who you
left with today.

40:06.323 --> 40:07.824
Wow, the bachelor,

40:07.891 --> 40:09.360
Walter Brewer.

40:09.426 --> 40:12.162
Who went to the old
Watsons' house.

40:17.767 --> 40:19.270
I don't know.

40:21.071 --> 40:22.839
You don't know?

40:23.407 --> 40:25.075
I don't know his name.

40:26.110 --> 40:27.844
You were with him
at the factory all day

40:27.911 --> 40:29.546
- and you don't know his name?
- Yes.

40:29.613 --> 40:30.714
- No.
- No?

40:30.780 --> 40:32.182
Yes, no?
No you don't?

40:32.249 --> 40:33.884
No. I don't.

40:35.119 --> 40:37.221
And all day
you work with him.

40:37.288 --> 40:38.155
Yes.

40:38.222 --> 40:40.924
What do the two
of you do there?

40:42.393 --> 40:43.560
It's just...

40:43.627 --> 40:45.429
Just what we've always done.

41:27.504 --> 41:28.906
Go on.

41:28.972 --> 41:31.108
Warm the truck up.
You can drive home.

41:31.875 --> 41:34.011
No. I-I'd rather not...

41:34.778 --> 41:36.380
I don't drive anymore.

41:37.081 --> 41:38.982
We're just down the road.

41:39.483 --> 41:41.085
I trust you.

42:02.940 --> 42:04.375
Okay,

42:04.842 --> 42:06.777
wagons ho.

42:27.798 --> 42:29.233
Hey!

42:29.299 --> 42:30.834
Why don't you and your wife
come over tonight,

42:30.901 --> 42:32.202
have supper with me
this evening?

42:32.269 --> 42:34.071
My... My wife usually...

42:34.138 --> 42:36.240
You tell her...

42:36.306 --> 42:38.442
- What's your wife's name?
- Iola.

42:38.942 --> 42:39.943
Iola!

42:40.010 --> 42:41.779
Supper will be ready in an hour.

42:41.845 --> 42:43.447
Don't have to bring a thing!

42:50.053 --> 42:51.288
I don't like this.

42:51.355 --> 42:53.924
We don't know
this man very well.

42:53.991 --> 42:55.692
You don't know him at all.

42:56.895 --> 42:58.996
I know he has a beard.

42:59.563 --> 43:00.831
My mother told me,

43:00.899 --> 43:03.200
"Be wary of men with beards."

43:04.835 --> 43:06.270
Why?

43:07.237 --> 43:09.573
Because they have
something to hide.

43:11.975 --> 43:14.044
What about Jesus?

43:21.285 --> 43:23.320
Iola!
Pleasure to meet you!

43:23.787 --> 43:25.322
Come in!

43:30.627 --> 43:33.230
I got me battles
that go way back.

43:35.132 --> 43:37.100
Got my first set
at a swap meet years ago.

43:37.167 --> 43:39.369
Been doin' them ever since.

43:41.972 --> 43:43.574
It keeps the body occupied.

43:45.008 --> 43:46.911
You say you were married?

43:46.977 --> 43:48.245
Oh, yes, ma'am.

43:48.312 --> 43:50.481
Cecilia and I
were married for...

43:51.548 --> 43:52.851
twenty-four years.

43:52.917 --> 43:54.218
Three kids together.

43:54.284 --> 43:56.353
Ray, Robert, and Rachel.

43:56.420 --> 43:59.022
They're out there doing
their own things now.

43:59.089 --> 44:00.324
I'm very proud of them.

44:00.390 --> 44:02.559
Your wife?
Where is she now?

44:02.626 --> 44:04.127
Iola...

44:05.295 --> 44:07.397
Cecilia passed away a year
before I moved up here.

44:07.464 --> 44:08.432
I'm...

44:08.499 --> 44:09.868
No-no, it's okay.

44:09.934 --> 44:11.301
She got the cancer.

44:11.368 --> 44:14.471
She fought hard,
but, in the end, it was...

44:15.038 --> 44:17.307
just too much.

44:17.374 --> 44:19.810
Leaving there was
a good thing for me.

44:19.878 --> 44:22.846
Change in surroundings and all.

44:22.914 --> 44:26.083
Yeah, I was kinda hoping this
town would be a place a man can...

44:27.986 --> 44:29.119
settle into.

44:29.186 --> 44:31.221
You understand?
Like, uh,

44:33.123 --> 44:35.092
a place to call home.

44:35.659 --> 44:37.427
Okay.

44:41.866 --> 44:43.001
Iola?

44:43.066 --> 44:45.602
Would you care
to lead us in grace?

44:45.669 --> 44:48.205
Uh, you want me
to say the blessing?

44:49.673 --> 44:52.042
Yes, ma'am.

44:52.109 --> 44:54.144
You do believe in Jesus,
don't you?

44:59.683 --> 45:01.618
- What do you think?
- Mm, oh!

45:01.685 --> 45:02.819
It looks bad...

45:02.887 --> 45:05.289
You know,
I've never had that.

45:05.355 --> 45:07.324
Depends on how you eat it.

45:07.391 --> 45:09.159
You got a bit of
an appetite on you.

45:09.226 --> 45:12.362
- Hm.
- Hm-hm.

45:12.429 --> 45:14.231
- Excuse me.
- Where did you learn to cook down South?

45:14.298 --> 45:15.632
I beg your pardon.

45:15.699 --> 45:19.069
Excuse me.
I just want to get some water.

45:19.136 --> 45:20.170
Of course.
Lemme get that for you...

45:20.237 --> 45:21.672
Oh no, I'll get it myself.

45:41.091 --> 45:42.392
Hmm.

46:02.245 --> 46:03.413
I'm going to go wash up.

46:03.480 --> 46:05.248
Yeah.
Just there to your left.

46:05.315 --> 46:07.351
Yeah, okay.

46:13.557 --> 46:14.691
Oh, yes.

46:14.758 --> 46:17.561
This does look
to be something special...

46:19.229 --> 46:21.933
nothin' quite like
a peach pie made from scratch...

46:22.000 --> 46:23.233
Ain't that right?

46:23.300 --> 46:25.268
So what are they?

46:25.736 --> 46:27.804
Your intensions.

46:27.872 --> 46:30.674
Your intensions at that
factory with my husband?

46:32.342 --> 46:34.511
I'm not sure I know
what you mean, ma'am.

46:34.578 --> 46:36.480
Well whatever it is
you have in mind,

46:36.546 --> 46:38.116
I wish you'd go on
and do it.

46:38.181 --> 46:40.018
Just do it and move on

46:40.084 --> 46:41.818
and leave my husband be.

46:43.353 --> 46:45.422
We don't need
any more trouble.

46:46.256 --> 46:47.824
Well, ma'am, I...

46:49.127 --> 46:50.661
Oh, thank you.

47:09.379 --> 47:11.448
Thank you.
That was very good.

47:12.016 --> 47:13.450
You're welcome.

47:28.398 --> 47:30.600
Havin' the Parkes
over for dinner.

47:32.070 --> 47:33.336
That's kinda...

47:34.404 --> 47:36.306
Kinda unexpected.

47:42.512 --> 47:44.448
So is seeing you leave
early in the morning

47:44.514 --> 47:46.750
and not come back home
'til after dark.

47:55.159 --> 47:57.494
You know somethin'?

47:57.561 --> 47:59.696
When I was a boy,
there was...

48:00.831 --> 48:02.466
six, seven...

48:02.532 --> 48:04.501
big plants in this town.

48:06.904 --> 48:09.573
New Liberty...
She was the last one.

48:09.639 --> 48:11.842
When that factory opened
there was...

48:12.877 --> 48:15.479
damn near 500 employees,

48:16.413 --> 48:18.348
then the layoffs came,

48:19.516 --> 48:21.752
then it dropped down
to a hundred workers,

48:22.854 --> 48:24.421
50...

48:28.893 --> 48:31.261
Shit.

48:31.328 --> 48:34.664
The companies
and the politicians...

48:37.135 --> 48:38.835
They say they're
gonna take of us.

48:41.304 --> 48:42.806
Fuck that.

48:46.443 --> 48:48.411
Thing is,
a person needs a job...

48:49.180 --> 48:50.714
to survive but,

48:52.482 --> 48:54.551
You... you need work

48:56.419 --> 48:58.655
to feel like
you're worth something.

49:06.730 --> 49:09.599
Why don't you tell me what
the hell is going on, Walt?

49:24.414 --> 49:26.284
Allery.

49:26.349 --> 49:27.952
He's at the front.

49:32.455 --> 49:33.858
Why are you...

49:34.591 --> 49:35.692
People will see...

49:35.759 --> 49:37.327
This is a small town, Allery.

49:37.394 --> 49:39.696
It's Hard to keep secrets
around here.

49:39.763 --> 49:42.599
I'm afraid our neighbors caught
wind of what we been up to.

49:43.633 --> 49:45.203
Oh, well, that's it then.

49:45.269 --> 49:47.437
Ah, no...
It's just startin'.

49:49.106 --> 49:51.741
Sure got a lot of folks wanting
in that factory this morning.

50:01.853 --> 50:02.586
Yes, sir,

50:02.652 --> 50:04.621
hell of a situation.

50:05.589 --> 50:07.591
You did this?

50:07.657 --> 50:09.260
Nuh-uh, no not me.

50:09.327 --> 50:11.428
They're out here
'cause of you.

50:13.396 --> 50:15.732
Ain't very polite
to keep 'em all waitin'.

50:15.799 --> 50:18.668
They ain't gonna
arrest us all, Allery.

50:21.239 --> 50:22.772
Ain't that right, ma'am?

50:23.473 --> 50:24.574
Hey!

50:24.641 --> 50:27.278
We gonna do
this thing or what?

50:27.345 --> 50:29.046
What did you
tell these people?

50:30.348 --> 50:31.949
I just told 'em what
we been workin' on.

50:32.016 --> 50:33.683
The deals you made.

50:34.751 --> 50:36.921
I didn't make any deals.

50:37.754 --> 50:40.157
I mean, not directly,

50:40.224 --> 50:42.525
but without you,
I wouldn't have thought of it.

50:42.592 --> 50:45.695
<i>I figured what with all the
surplus in the warehouse,</i>

50:45.762 --> 50:47.764
<i>our buyers needed
to be informed...</i>

50:47.831 --> 50:50.500
<i>To understand that'd cost them
more to go somewhere else...</i>

50:52.169 --> 50:53.637
<i>...than if they'd
just stick with us.</i>

50:53.703 --> 50:55.940
<i>After a few phone calls
with them.</i>

50:56.673 --> 50:58.242
We made an agreement.

50:58.309 --> 50:59.776
What kind of agreement?

50:59.843 --> 51:02.246
That if we finish up
the orders left undone...

51:02.313 --> 51:03.680
If we complete our contracts

51:03.747 --> 51:06.516
our buyers will
compensate us for it.

51:06.583 --> 51:10.453
Ain't a person in here
who can't use that money.

51:10.520 --> 51:13.823
The buyers also agreed to lean
on the big wigs at corporate.

51:15.126 --> 51:18.561
- I don't follow.
- To keep the factory open.

51:18.628 --> 51:20.197
Give us some leverage.

51:20.264 --> 51:23.566
All we gotta do is hold up
our end and meet deadline.

51:23.633 --> 51:26.070
Deadline?
What deadline?

51:26.137 --> 51:29.373
When the factory closed, we had us
five open and unfinished contracts.

51:29.439 --> 51:31.075
Five.

51:31.142 --> 51:32.575
Now, by my math,

51:32.642 --> 51:34.611
we should be able to fill those
orders in one week.

51:34.678 --> 51:37.281
I mean if the Good Lord could
make all of creation in six days,

51:37.348 --> 51:40.817
I'll be damned if we can't
handle a couple orders in seven.

51:40.885 --> 51:41.886
Keep comin'.

51:41.953 --> 51:42.920
My man!

51:42.987 --> 51:44.989
Boss says
take it down there.

51:47.124 --> 51:49.160
Besides, it's not
like we're stealing.

51:49.226 --> 51:50.794
We're just gettin' paid
for the work we do...

51:50.861 --> 51:53.496
Work that was comin' to us.

51:53.563 --> 51:55.132
Corporate will still
get theirs.

51:56.334 --> 51:58.002
We don't have permission
to do this.

51:59.437 --> 52:02.073
If the company finds out they're
not gonna let us back in here.

52:03.640 --> 52:05.109
Oh, they"re gonna find out.

52:05.176 --> 52:07.844
We're going to make
damn good sure of that.

52:08.645 --> 52:10.580
We ain't leavin'.

52:15.685 --> 52:17.321
Okay...

52:17.388 --> 52:18.621
in three, two, one.

52:18.688 --> 52:20.091
A week ago,

52:20.157 --> 52:22.259
New Liberty Plastics
abruptly halted operation

52:22.326 --> 52:25.162
and closed the doors of its Clayton
Road manufacturing facility.

52:25.229 --> 52:27.731
<i>But to look inside
the factory today...</i>

52:27.797 --> 52:29.566
<i>Everything is running
full speed ahead.</i>

52:29.632 --> 52:31.835
<i>New Liberty's former workers
have re-entered the plant</i>

52:31.902 --> 52:33.570
<i>and have pledged
to stay at their jobs,</i>

52:33.636 --> 52:35.072
<i>assuring that
in one week's time,</i>

52:35.139 --> 52:36.706
<i>they'll fulfill
the outstanding orders</i>

52:36.773 --> 52:38.775
<i>promised to
the factory's clients.</i>

52:45.049 --> 52:47.550
- Hey, that's us! Benny, we're on TV!
- Yeah-yeah, I know, shh.

52:47.617 --> 52:50.087
<i>The workers have also vowed
to occupy and not leave the facility</i>

52:50.154 --> 52:54.125
<i>in an effort to pressure New Liberty's
parent company, Hatwell Corporation,</i>

52:54.191 --> 52:56.559
<i>to come to the table and
potentially re-open the factory.</i>

52:56.626 --> 52:58.695
- Fuck yeah.
- That's right.

52:58.762 --> 53:01.465
<i>We want the company to know that
it ain't right what they done.</i>

53:01.531 --> 53:05.668
<i>You just can't up and take away
things from good people like this.</i>

53:07.905 --> 53:13.344
<i>We just want what's fair.</i>

53:13.411 --> 53:14.778
Brian, I'm watching it.

53:14.844 --> 53:16.414
Why the hell do
you think I called you?

53:16.480 --> 53:18.115
What? No! No, no.

53:18.182 --> 53:18.916
No cops.

53:18.983 --> 53:20.550
No, no don't let Frank know.

53:20.617 --> 53:21.818
Tell him to call again.

53:21.886 --> 53:24.088
Jesus, this thing is bad enough.

53:25.456 --> 53:27.624
Look it, uh...

53:27.690 --> 53:29.793
You got that number
for corporate legal?

53:29.860 --> 53:33.531
<i>Mr. Parkes, what would you like
to tell your former employer?</i>

53:33.596 --> 53:35.832
- Hey, it's Allery!
- Shh-shh-shh.

53:37.767 --> 53:40.037
<i>What is it you want to say?</i>

53:40.104 --> 53:41.872
<i>Mr. Parkes...</i>

53:41.939 --> 53:43.874
<i>I just want to do my job.</i>

53:54.885 --> 53:56.454
<i>Thank you, Brandon.</i>

53:56.520 --> 53:59.689
<i>Brandon on location
at New Liberty Plastics...</i>

54:14.038 --> 54:15.506
Y'all bring everything in here.

54:15.573 --> 54:16.974
We'll find a place for it.

54:17.041 --> 54:20.211
God bless it,
look at all this stuff.

54:20.277 --> 54:22.146
Oh, let me
help you with that.

54:23.247 --> 54:25.483
Right. Thank you.

54:25.549 --> 54:27.985
There we go. There we go.

54:28.052 --> 54:29.752
Don't be shy,
come on in here.

54:29.819 --> 54:32.622
There we go.
They're right over there.

54:42.133 --> 54:43.901
How you doin'?

54:47.837 --> 54:50.141
I usually walk at night.

54:52.343 --> 54:54.777
Still have a lot of food
left if you're hungry.

55:01.485 --> 55:04.054
Shouldn't keep
a good woman waitin'.

55:05.022 --> 55:06.123
Yeah.

55:06.957 --> 55:08.859
I'm sorry I'm late.

55:10.094 --> 55:12.762
I didn't know what
they were feeding you here,

55:12.829 --> 55:15.132
so I made you something
you'd eat.

55:15.665 --> 55:16.901
And, uh, a pie

55:16.967 --> 55:18.602
for your friend Walter.

55:18.668 --> 55:19.769
He liked it so much.

55:19.836 --> 55:22.540
And, a bed roll.

55:22.606 --> 55:24.008
There's a pillow in here.

55:24.074 --> 55:25.643
It's the one from
your side of the bed.

55:25.708 --> 55:27.710
And pajamas

55:27.777 --> 55:29.679
and clean clothes,

55:29.746 --> 55:31.982
your working clothes.

55:34.118 --> 55:36.987
Yes, I should go.

55:37.655 --> 55:39.156
Iola...

55:41.058 --> 55:42.359
Iola.

56:04.582 --> 56:06.951
Here you go, Allery.

56:07.017 --> 56:09.553
I called in a favor
from Howard...

56:09.620 --> 56:11.922
There at the
army surplus downtown.

56:11.989 --> 56:14.824
I think that's a good one.
I hope it sleeps okay for you.

56:14.892 --> 56:16.093
Oh, this will be fine.

56:16.160 --> 56:18.996
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Yeah.

56:20.364 --> 56:21.865
Oh, no.

56:28.038 --> 56:30.140
Why did you tell everyone...

56:30.941 --> 56:32.977
this was my idea?

56:34.844 --> 56:36.981
These folks need to look
to one of their own.

56:37.915 --> 56:40.150
Not to some
Johnny-come-lately like me.

56:42.720 --> 56:44.989
I also don't like seein'
a man get judged,

56:46.123 --> 56:48.825
least not without walking
some in that man's shoes.

57:21.425 --> 57:23.294
Hey, Gabe!

57:23.861 --> 57:25.362
It's freezing.

57:26.563 --> 57:29.099
What did you do,
leave the windows open?

57:29.633 --> 57:31.135
Gabe?

57:32.670 --> 57:34.271
Hey, Gabe?

57:39.643 --> 57:41.011
Gabe?

57:41.879 --> 57:42.880
Jesus!

57:42.946 --> 57:44.315
Oh, my God! No!

57:44.381 --> 57:46.650
No! No, no, no!

57:46.717 --> 57:48.352
Come on, you okay?

57:49.186 --> 57:50.487
No!

57:51.322 --> 57:52.956
No!

57:53.424 --> 57:54.692
Oh, my God!

58:05.369 --> 58:07.004
Why did...

58:17.348 --> 58:19.116
Why did you...

58:21.752 --> 58:24.121
Why did you do this?

58:32.763 --> 58:34.131
My boy.

58:34.965 --> 58:35.966
No...

58:36.033 --> 58:38.202
Allery?

58:38.969 --> 58:40.404
Allery?

58:43.807 --> 58:45.642
You okay?

58:45.709 --> 58:47.211
You all right?

58:56.253 --> 58:57.388
My son...

58:57.454 --> 58:59.123
My...

59:00.524 --> 59:02.192
My son...

59:04.328 --> 59:05.696
I was...

59:05.763 --> 59:07.498
I was too late...

59:08.966 --> 59:10.567
And I lost him.

59:12.736 --> 59:14.171
I know.

59:18.208 --> 59:20.144
I know all about that.

59:33.892 --> 59:35.426
Hey, mornin'.

59:36.093 --> 59:37.561
Good morning.

59:38.897 --> 59:39.898
Oh, shoot.

59:39.963 --> 59:42.032
I just had my coupons...

59:42.099 --> 59:43.801
They're here somewhere I...

59:43.868 --> 59:45.035
Don't sweat it.

59:45.102 --> 59:46.503
I got you covered.

59:49.573 --> 59:51.241
Um...

59:54.645 --> 59:57.181
What they're doin'
down at the factory...

59:57.781 --> 59:59.216
That's bad ass.

01:00:12.830 --> 01:00:14.431
It's sunshine, boys.

01:00:15.132 --> 01:00:17.201
What the hell is this?

01:00:17.267 --> 01:00:20.037
Found them.
They was in storage.

01:00:20.103 --> 01:00:21.839
I'm guessing
you're about a size, uh...

01:00:21.906 --> 01:00:22.941
medium.

01:00:23.006 --> 01:00:24.541
We're a team here.

01:00:24.608 --> 01:00:26.343
A unified front.

01:00:26.410 --> 01:00:28.078
Let's start looking the part.

01:00:28.145 --> 01:00:29.680
Ain't that right, chief?

01:00:29.746 --> 01:00:30.949
Here you go.

01:00:31.014 --> 01:00:32.316
Here you go.
Comin' at ya.

01:00:32.382 --> 01:00:34.985
- Number B.
- Number B.

01:01:01.712 --> 01:01:03.480
- I got a pair of sixes.
- Pair of five...

01:01:08.085 --> 01:01:09.086
That's...

01:01:09.152 --> 01:01:11.021
Jacks on three.

01:01:12.589 --> 01:01:15.125
That's like,
three in a row already!

01:01:15.526 --> 01:01:17.127
This guy...

01:01:51.395 --> 01:01:52.729
I score!

01:02:20.724 --> 01:02:21.993
Shit.

01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:23.193
All right,
here's a two...

01:02:24.996 --> 01:02:26.463
...I'm going for four.

01:02:27.297 --> 01:02:28.866
All right.

01:02:28.933 --> 01:02:30.068
- Nothing?
- Nah.

01:02:30.133 --> 01:02:31.970
I got... I got...

01:02:32.036 --> 01:02:33.270
three Jacks.

01:02:33.337 --> 01:02:34.738
Damn, Allery!

01:02:38.141 --> 01:02:39.978
Four.

01:02:40.044 --> 01:02:42.312
You know, I'm never inviting you
over to my place for poker night.

01:02:42.379 --> 01:02:44.015
I'm sorry.

01:02:44.082 --> 01:02:46.017
Marg, you're a shitty player,
you can come over anytime.

01:02:46.084 --> 01:02:47.217
Screw you.

01:02:48.819 --> 01:02:50.955
Hey, where did you
learn to play cards?

01:02:51.022 --> 01:02:52.924
- Grandmother.
- Oh, yeah?

01:02:52.991 --> 01:02:55.860
Well she must have been a hell of a
player 'cause she taught you well.

01:02:55.927 --> 01:02:57.694
Allery?

01:02:57.761 --> 01:02:59.396
You think we'll hear
something soon from the brass?

01:02:59.463 --> 01:03:00.999
Uh, I'm not sure...

01:03:01.065 --> 01:03:03.901
Soon as Allery hears,
he'll let everybody know.

01:03:03.968 --> 01:03:05.103
Right, but we're
three days in now

01:03:05.168 --> 01:03:06.370
and me and some of
the others workers

01:03:06.436 --> 01:03:07.437
were trying
to figure out when we...

01:03:07.504 --> 01:03:09.206
I said soon as he hears!

01:03:13.577 --> 01:03:15.612
Can someone turn
that goddamn thing off?

01:03:18.049 --> 01:03:19.449
Christ.

01:03:33.263 --> 01:03:34.831
So we playing or what?

01:03:35.666 --> 01:03:37.135
Yeah.

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:38.635
Yeah, yeah, no.

01:03:38.702 --> 01:03:40.004
Ante up.

01:03:40.071 --> 01:03:42.372
Ante up, guys, let's go.

01:03:42.439 --> 01:03:44.541
Every time you deal,
I get shit for cards.

01:03:44.608 --> 01:03:46.376
Oh, it's not
the cards, baby.

01:03:46.443 --> 01:03:48.311
It's the dumbass
who's playing 'em.

01:03:48.378 --> 01:03:50.580
Screw you.

01:03:50.647 --> 01:03:52.282
Again.

01:04:04.028 --> 01:04:06.396
Wonderin' when you were
gonna get your ass up.

01:04:08.465 --> 01:04:10.134
You can sleep
when you're dead.

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:12.103
We got work to do.

01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:13.503
Come on.

01:04:28.752 --> 01:04:30.353
Here we go.

01:04:38.228 --> 01:04:41.264
I've been asked to deliver this on
behalf of the Hatwell Corporation.

01:04:41.331 --> 01:04:42.599
Head office.

01:04:42.666 --> 01:04:44.334
What the hell's in it
for you, Gordman?

01:04:44.401 --> 01:04:46.436
Why you throwing in
with them?

01:04:46.503 --> 01:04:48.805
Cause it could mean some work on the
other side of this thing, that's why.

01:04:48.873 --> 01:04:51.541
Hatwell might be buying out the
sheet metal plant over in Grundy.

01:04:51.608 --> 01:04:54.078
Shit, that's just rumor
and you know it.

01:04:54.145 --> 01:04:55.947
Rumor's are a hell of a lot
better than make-believe.

01:04:56.013 --> 01:04:57.614
And for the life of me,

01:04:57.681 --> 01:05:00.017
I don't get what you all think
you're accomplishing here.

01:05:00.084 --> 01:05:02.252
You're following the lead of
some lost and confused old man?

01:05:02.319 --> 01:05:04.454
It makes no goddamn sense...

01:05:04.521 --> 01:05:05.622
We don't need you!

01:05:05.689 --> 01:05:07.290
You hear me?!
We don't need you!

01:05:07.357 --> 01:05:08.825
We don't need you!

01:05:20.604 --> 01:05:22.874
I advise you
to do what they say.

01:05:37.955 --> 01:05:40.290
We all knew this was comin'.

01:05:40.357 --> 01:05:41.926
This is how the game's played.

01:05:41.993 --> 01:05:44.795
We stick to our guns,
we'll be fine.

01:05:45.529 --> 01:05:47.631
The buyers are with us.

01:05:47.697 --> 01:05:49.633
I'm betting them folks
over there at corporate

01:05:49.699 --> 01:05:51.269
will cave before
we even finish the jobs.

01:05:51.334 --> 01:05:53.670
We ain't gonna finish
nothin' in here with no power.

01:05:53.737 --> 01:05:55.639
You know, it's supposed
to get damn cold tonight.

01:05:55.705 --> 01:05:57.674
Look, they're just tryin'
to muscle us.

01:05:57.741 --> 01:06:00.044
They won't let us freeze.
Guarantee you that.

01:06:00.111 --> 01:06:02.679
Well this here says
we're trespassing.

01:06:02.746 --> 01:06:05.216
Says we have to be out
by 8:00 A.M. tomorrow

01:06:05.283 --> 01:06:08.252
or they're gonna call the law to come
in here and start making arrests.

01:06:08.318 --> 01:06:09.486
That's bullshit.

01:06:09.553 --> 01:06:11.222
They're not gonna do that.

01:06:11.289 --> 01:06:12.957
And what if they do?

01:06:13.024 --> 01:06:15.425
Now it's one thing
to lose your job...

01:06:15.492 --> 01:06:17.427
it's a whole other one
to go to jail.

01:06:17.494 --> 01:06:20.097
I got kids at home.

01:06:20.164 --> 01:06:21.832
I understand that.

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.502
How you think that's
gonna make 'em look?

01:06:25.569 --> 01:06:27.437
Folks at home watching TV,

01:06:27.504 --> 01:06:29.941
seeing a bunch of
unemployed factory workers

01:06:30.007 --> 01:06:32.009
getting dragged off
in handcuffs?

01:06:33.476 --> 01:06:35.213
Company don't want that,

01:06:35.279 --> 01:06:36.746
I promise you.

01:06:36.813 --> 01:06:39.449
I respect what you're
all tryin' to do here.

01:06:40.350 --> 01:06:41.853
But I'm out.

01:06:42.452 --> 01:06:44.454
Yeah, me, too.

01:06:44.521 --> 01:06:46.123
Look, I need work now.

01:06:46.190 --> 01:06:47.457
I can't afford to wait.

01:06:47.524 --> 01:06:48.960
I'm sorry.

01:06:54.265 --> 01:06:56.399
People, look,

01:06:56.466 --> 01:06:57.534
this is all a bluff.

01:06:57.601 --> 01:06:59.402
And we need
to call them on it.

01:06:59.469 --> 01:07:02.073
send 'em a message sayin',

01:07:02.139 --> 01:07:04.008
that if they don't give
us back our power,

01:07:04.075 --> 01:07:06.543
then we're fixin' to make
calls of our own.

01:07:06.610 --> 01:07:07.744
To the real news.

01:07:07.811 --> 01:07:10.248
Not this local station shit.

01:07:10.314 --> 01:07:12.849
I'm talkin' the big boys.
Networks.

01:07:13.416 --> 01:07:14.886
Social media.

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:16.954
Show the world!

01:07:17.021 --> 01:07:18.755
Right?

01:07:18.822 --> 01:07:20.757
Each and everyone of you.

01:07:21.458 --> 01:07:23.027
We should put it
to a vote.

01:07:29.432 --> 01:07:31.102
I wanna hear
what Allery thinks.

01:07:42.412 --> 01:07:43.948
We stay.

01:07:54.292 --> 01:07:56.693
I got a couple more gas generators coming.
They're from Smitty's.

01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:58.428
Says they're good motors.
Durable.

01:07:58.495 --> 01:08:00.630
I got another one comin'
from the VFW.

01:08:00.697 --> 01:08:02.099
Only 13 horse though.

01:08:02.166 --> 01:08:03.800
I can scare up
one more if we need it.

01:08:03.868 --> 01:08:06.636
I know they got one
over at the Elks Lodge.

01:08:11.075 --> 01:08:12.742
Allery,

01:08:12.809 --> 01:08:15.779
you want me to go see about
that generator at the Elks?

01:08:17.014 --> 01:08:18.581
Yeah.

01:08:18.648 --> 01:08:19.984
Yeah...

01:08:20.051 --> 01:08:22.118
G-Get what you can.

01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:24.322
And, um,

01:08:24.388 --> 01:08:26.122
check... check the back room.

01:08:26.189 --> 01:08:29.060
They kept the
lost-and-found back there.

01:08:29.126 --> 01:08:32.629
Might be some extra
coats and gloves.

01:08:32.696 --> 01:08:34.663
- Yeah, good idea.
- All right.

01:08:57.620 --> 01:08:59.656
Hello?

01:09:01.591 --> 01:09:03.127
Walter?

01:09:15.372 --> 01:09:17.041
What are you doing in here?

01:09:29.386 --> 01:09:31.787
All these old,
used up machines...

01:09:34.158 --> 01:09:36.493
Each one...

01:09:36.559 --> 01:09:38.194
did what they was built for,

01:09:41.899 --> 01:09:44.068
then they was tossed aside.

01:09:45.036 --> 01:09:46.736
Tossed aside!

01:09:50.941 --> 01:09:52.809
Yeah, well,
nobody gives a shit!

01:09:54.979 --> 01:09:57.680
Jesus...

01:10:06.123 --> 01:10:07.757
Whoops.

01:10:09.026 --> 01:10:11.228
That wasn't supposed
to happen, was it?

01:10:12.463 --> 01:10:13.864
Hey, hey.

01:10:13.931 --> 01:10:15.665
What the hell's
goin' on in here?

01:10:15.732 --> 01:10:17.767
Oh, Jesus!

01:10:18.202 --> 01:10:19.636
He just...

01:10:19.702 --> 01:10:21.539
He just had too much to drink.

01:10:21.604 --> 01:10:22.973
All right, his cut
doesn't look that deep.

01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:25.176
Come on. Let's clean him up
and help him to bed.

01:10:25.242 --> 01:10:27.478
- I'm walking.
- Come on, take it easy, Walter.

01:10:27.545 --> 01:10:29.113
Come on.

01:10:30.881 --> 01:10:34.118
He just had too much to drink,

01:10:35.086 --> 01:10:36.820
that's all!

01:11:00.743 --> 01:11:02.246
Fuckin' quitters.

01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:19.196
Hey...

01:11:19.762 --> 01:11:21.165
They flinched.

01:11:25.069 --> 01:11:27.471
You're damn right they did.

01:11:27.538 --> 01:11:29.874
Ha-ha!

01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:31.408
Son-of-a-bitch backed down!

01:11:31.475 --> 01:11:33.676
The buyers are leaning on 'em!

01:11:33.743 --> 01:11:36.013
They buckled!

01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:38.983
Ah, now they know it,
by God!

01:11:39.049 --> 01:11:41.018
They know it, now they
got a fight on their hands!

01:11:41.085 --> 01:11:42.386
They got a fight
on their hands!

01:11:42.453 --> 01:11:43.921
Yeah, they got
a fight on their hands!

01:11:43.988 --> 01:11:46.123
Ah, lookey who's here!

01:11:48.626 --> 01:11:49.927
Just stay where you are.

01:11:49.994 --> 01:11:52.129
You don't come near me,
understand?

01:11:54.831 --> 01:11:56.699
Your boys are nervous, huh?
We got our power back.

01:11:56.766 --> 01:11:59.069
'Cause they don't
want your asses to freeze...

01:11:59.136 --> 01:12:01.338
You're a liability
in this place.

01:12:02.705 --> 01:12:04.241
Look,

01:12:04.308 --> 01:12:05.342
they, uh...

01:12:05.409 --> 01:12:06.644
they want to talk.

01:12:06.709 --> 01:12:09.079
- Today.
- Yeah, I bet they do.

01:12:09.812 --> 01:12:11.248
I'll tell you what, Stan.

01:12:11.315 --> 01:12:12.650
Why don't you crawl back

01:12:12.715 --> 01:12:14.518
and tell 'em if
they wanna negotiate,

01:12:14.585 --> 01:12:16.854
they know exactly
where to find us.

01:12:17.855 --> 01:12:19.957
They only want
to talk to him.

01:12:27.031 --> 01:12:30.467
Well. Allery Parkes.

01:12:30.534 --> 01:12:32.503
You've really started
something here, haven't you?

01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:33.938
This statement of yours

01:12:34.004 --> 01:12:35.639
is all everyone at HQ
is talking about.

01:12:35.705 --> 01:12:36.941
I'm not making
any statement.

01:12:37.007 --> 01:12:39.210
Oh, but you are,
Mr. Parkes.

01:12:40.710 --> 01:12:43.948
Now clearly you have earned the
allegiance of your co-workers.

01:12:44.014 --> 01:12:45.082
And I can assure you,

01:12:45.149 --> 01:12:47.717
you have our attention
as well.

01:12:47.784 --> 01:12:49.386
In particular, you have mine.

01:12:49.453 --> 01:12:51.388
See, it's my job is to make sure
that the company's transitions

01:12:51.455 --> 01:12:54.391
or in the case of your factory,
its closures, go smoothly.

01:12:54.925 --> 01:12:56.759
And you, Mr. Parkes,

01:12:56.826 --> 01:12:59.296
are making closure
notably difficult.

01:13:02.799 --> 01:13:04.969
How well do you know
Walter Brewer?

01:13:06.637 --> 01:13:10.074
Your neighbors tell me that he's the
one that assisted you into the factory,

01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:12.543
that he helped you persuade the
other workers to join you there.

01:13:12.610 --> 01:13:15.845
I didn't persuade anybody
to do anything.

01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:18.249
I believe you, Mr. Parkes.

01:13:21.619 --> 01:13:23.220
How long have you known him?

01:13:25.788 --> 01:13:27.725
What are you
asking me exactly?

01:13:27.790 --> 01:13:29.326
A third cup, please.

01:13:30.928 --> 01:13:32.896
There's somebody
you need to meet.

01:13:39.637 --> 01:13:41.105
Step this way.

01:13:42.973 --> 01:13:44.608
Mr. Parkes,

01:13:44.675 --> 01:13:45.976
this is Cecilia Brewer.

01:13:46.043 --> 01:13:47.645
Walter Brewer's wife.

01:13:47.711 --> 01:13:48.811
Former.

01:13:48.879 --> 01:13:49.880
Of course.

01:13:49.947 --> 01:13:51.448
My mistake.

01:13:54.018 --> 01:13:58.389
Walter was always real good at hiding
his problems from folks at work.

01:13:59.223 --> 01:14:01.759
At least until all
the trouble started.

01:14:01.824 --> 01:14:03.661
And, with Walter,

01:14:03.727 --> 01:14:05.296
the trouble always started.

01:14:06.096 --> 01:14:07.898
Man's changed jobs
and addresses

01:14:07.965 --> 01:14:10.100
more than most people
change their mind.

01:14:10.868 --> 01:14:12.369
When Walter's moods were bad,

01:14:12.436 --> 01:14:15.205
he would drink a bottle
of vodka a day.

01:14:16.006 --> 01:14:17.408
In high times,

01:14:17.474 --> 01:14:19.410
he'd be a ball of fire.

01:14:19.476 --> 01:14:21.912
Never even need any sleep.

01:14:22.379 --> 01:14:23.714
On low days,

01:14:23.781 --> 01:14:25.716
he could barely
get out of bed.

01:14:25.783 --> 01:14:27.051
He ever seek treatment?

01:14:27.117 --> 01:14:28.552
Walter tried everything.

01:14:28.619 --> 01:14:31.121
But when he'd feel good,
he'd go off his pills.

01:14:31.188 --> 01:14:33.223
Said he didn't need
the help.

01:14:34.124 --> 01:14:36.293
That's when everything
would go south.

01:14:37.461 --> 01:14:39.463
I'm sorry, but...

01:14:41.332 --> 01:14:42.533
Aside from...

01:14:42.599 --> 01:14:44.902
your husband lying
about your existence,

01:14:44.968 --> 01:14:48.272
what does any of this
have to do with me?

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:51.075
He don't know?

01:14:54.044 --> 01:14:55.612
Mr. Parkes,

01:14:55.679 --> 01:14:57.081
Your pal Walter,

01:14:57.147 --> 01:14:59.083
contacted a half dozen
of old buyers

01:14:59.149 --> 01:15:01.385
to reinitiate
and complete old deals.

01:15:01.452 --> 01:15:02.619
Yeah, well,

01:15:02.686 --> 01:15:03.854
we're doing that.

01:15:03.921 --> 01:15:05.889
We're filling those orders.

01:15:06.290 --> 01:15:07.524
Mr. Parkes,

01:15:07.591 --> 01:15:10.094
none of those customers
accepted Walter's offer.

01:15:10.160 --> 01:15:11.528
That's not right.

01:15:11.595 --> 01:15:14.231
They said that if
we finished the work,

01:15:14.298 --> 01:15:15.799
they would honor those
contracts.

01:15:15.866 --> 01:15:17.401
Then they would pay us

01:15:17.468 --> 01:15:20.304
and then they would help us
keep the factory open...

01:15:20.371 --> 01:15:22.339
Mr. Parkes.

01:15:22.406 --> 01:15:23.741
There's no money,

01:15:23.807 --> 01:15:24.908
no new contracts.

01:15:24.975 --> 01:15:26.110
There're no deals.

01:15:26.176 --> 01:15:27.711
There never were any.

01:15:27.778 --> 01:15:29.146
The only deals that existed

01:15:29.213 --> 01:15:32.182
were in Mr. Brewer's
unfortunate imagination.

01:15:33.817 --> 01:15:36.019
Mr. Parkes, there is
no work to be done.

01:15:42.659 --> 01:15:44.161
In here...

01:15:44.228 --> 01:15:46.997
are the names and numbers
of clients that had accounts

01:15:47.064 --> 01:15:49.099
with the factory
before the closure.

01:15:49.533 --> 01:15:51.034
Take it.

01:15:51.535 --> 01:15:53.303
Call them if you like.

01:15:55.139 --> 01:15:58.242
It ain't the first time
Walter's played with the truth.

01:15:59.943 --> 01:16:01.145
But putting a whole

01:16:01.211 --> 01:16:02.946
factory of people back to work?

01:16:03.013 --> 01:16:05.182
That is something else.

01:16:05.249 --> 01:16:07.886
I used to ask myself,

01:16:07.951 --> 01:16:10.954
why he was like this?

01:16:11.021 --> 01:16:13.624
What was the reason why
he acted the way he acted?

01:16:14.925 --> 01:16:16.126
I even wondered

01:16:16.193 --> 01:16:18.429
if I did something wrong.

01:16:19.696 --> 01:16:24.201
But I finally figured out
that there was no reason.

01:16:25.969 --> 01:16:28.338
It was just who he was.

01:16:32.877 --> 01:16:35.179
Walter tell you we had children?

01:16:39.516 --> 01:16:41.318
He's done that before.

01:16:41.385 --> 01:16:45.189
Fact is, he could never
settle on the idea.

01:16:46.156 --> 01:16:48.025
Wouldn't risk it.

01:16:49.259 --> 01:16:53.530
Afraid he was gonna pass on
his troubles to someone else.

01:16:54.231 --> 01:16:56.767
Someone innocent.

01:16:56.834 --> 01:16:59.369
The children
he told you about...

01:16:59.436 --> 01:17:02.105
they were the family
we never had.

01:17:05.409 --> 01:17:07.511
I suppose it's the same
reason...

01:17:07.578 --> 01:17:09.513
why he said I died.

01:17:13.283 --> 01:17:16.220
It's easier to, uh,
invent stories

01:17:16.286 --> 01:17:18.255
than live with the truth.

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:26.396
Look, I need to go.
I've got a plane to catch.

01:17:26.463 --> 01:17:27.664
Yeah, right.

01:17:35.172 --> 01:17:37.207
You must be some...

01:17:37.274 --> 01:17:39.576
Some kinda big man

01:17:39.643 --> 01:17:43.146
for them to fly me all the way
here just to talk to you.

01:17:44.047 --> 01:17:45.148
Oh, I'm not...

01:17:45.215 --> 01:17:47.351
I'm not a big man.

01:17:47.417 --> 01:17:48.785
Well,

01:17:48.853 --> 01:17:50.521
Walter must think so.

01:17:52.055 --> 01:17:53.524
I...

01:17:54.658 --> 01:17:56.895
I understand,

01:17:56.961 --> 01:17:59.062
you know.

01:17:59.129 --> 01:18:03.100
I understand why you
needed to leave him.

01:18:05.335 --> 01:18:07.271
I didn't leave.

01:18:08.305 --> 01:18:10.240
I would've never...

01:18:11.174 --> 01:18:13.310
He was the love of my life.

01:18:15.078 --> 01:18:17.180
Walter's the one that left.

01:18:20.317 --> 01:18:22.085
Said I deserved better.

01:18:23.487 --> 01:18:26.623
That he didn't
want to see me hurt no more.

01:18:35.065 --> 01:18:37.234
When he was his true self...

01:18:38.368 --> 01:18:41.338
Walter was the greatest man
I ever known.

01:18:44.107 --> 01:18:45.742
That, you can believe.

01:18:59.189 --> 01:19:01.893
I'm sorry about
that back there.

01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:04.062
Corporate just thought
you might need some

01:19:04.127 --> 01:19:05.762
additional persuasion.

01:19:07.564 --> 01:19:08.665
Mr. Parkes?

01:19:08.732 --> 01:19:10.434
Yep.

01:19:12.836 --> 01:19:14.471
Look, the company's
prepared to offer you

01:19:14.538 --> 01:19:16.373
and the other workers
a revised severance.

01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:18.108
It's not much of a deal,

01:19:18.175 --> 01:19:20.177
but it's better than nothing.

01:19:21.545 --> 01:19:24.214
Allery, you've got to tell
the other workers the truth.

01:19:25.148 --> 01:19:26.750
I mean, if you don't, we will.

01:19:28.418 --> 01:19:30.387
But either way, all of this...

01:19:31.688 --> 01:19:33.357
It's finished.

01:20:41.291 --> 01:20:43.460
Nice view from
the boss's desk, huh?

01:20:44.261 --> 01:20:45.863
I think it suits you.

01:20:47.197 --> 01:20:48.732
Is that what you think?

01:20:52.036 --> 01:20:53.871
Why did you do this?

01:20:58.208 --> 01:20:59.877
I know about the orders.

01:21:01.244 --> 01:21:03.280
What are you talking about?

01:21:06.249 --> 01:21:08.119
The wages, the contracts.
The buyers.

01:21:08.186 --> 01:21:09.921
The buyers that we do not have.

01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:12.689
I see.

01:21:13.457 --> 01:21:14.791
Them company men

01:21:14.859 --> 01:21:16.293
they gave you some line,

01:21:16.359 --> 01:21:18.495
tryin' to shake
your faith, is that it?

01:21:19.596 --> 01:21:21.331
Well, I know how to fix that.

01:21:21.398 --> 01:21:23.300
I'm gonna show you
the contracts...

01:21:23.366 --> 01:21:26.137
to put an end to this
right here, right now.

01:21:26.204 --> 01:21:27.304
All right?

01:21:27.370 --> 01:21:29.639
- Now, the paper work...
- No.

01:21:29.706 --> 01:21:30.774
Was here.

01:21:30.841 --> 01:21:32.375
I know they're around
here somewhere.

01:21:32.442 --> 01:21:34.178
- Stop.
- I know they're somewhere around here.

01:21:34.277 --> 01:21:35.179
I just got to find them is all...

01:21:35.245 --> 01:21:37.181
Just stop!

01:21:37.247 --> 01:21:38.883
They're misplaced is all.

01:21:39.917 --> 01:21:41.318
Oh, hell with it, look,

01:21:41.384 --> 01:21:43.154
contracts or no contracts,
what's it matter?

01:21:43.221 --> 01:21:44.321
We're makin' them orders.

01:21:44.387 --> 01:21:45.522
They'll need to pay us.

01:21:45.589 --> 01:21:47.091
They'll need to
reopen the factory.

01:21:47.158 --> 01:21:49.193
You know that's
not going to happen.

01:21:49.259 --> 01:21:50.862
Course it is.

01:21:50.928 --> 01:21:53.363
We just all hold together
and finish what we started.

01:21:53.430 --> 01:21:55.298
They're not going to reopen!

01:21:55.365 --> 01:21:58.102
They're not going
to do anything!

01:21:58.169 --> 01:21:59.736
They told me the truth.

01:22:00.437 --> 01:22:01.571
The truth...

01:22:01.638 --> 01:22:02.874
Ha!

01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:04.775
That's their truth.

01:22:06.244 --> 01:22:09.346
Oh, hey,
we've created our own.

01:22:11.149 --> 01:22:12.884
Look at what we're doing here.

01:22:15.219 --> 01:22:16.520
We're doin' something great.

01:22:16.586 --> 01:22:18.688
We're makin' somethin'
from nothing...

01:22:18.755 --> 01:22:20.323
Enough!

01:22:20.724 --> 01:22:22.592
Enough lies!

01:22:35.338 --> 01:22:36.974
We was doin' our jobs

01:22:38.742 --> 01:22:41.578
and that company pulled
everything from under us.

01:22:43.147 --> 01:22:46.616
We did what we was told
and they robbed us

01:22:47.484 --> 01:22:49.753
of what we had and who we were.

01:22:51.588 --> 01:22:54.926
Bet your last dollar,
our work was shipped overseas

01:22:54.992 --> 01:22:56.961
before the doors here
was even closed.

01:23:00.298 --> 01:23:01.966
But who gives a damn?

01:23:03.234 --> 01:23:04.568
No one.

01:23:05.769 --> 01:23:08.705
Who gives a damn if what
we're doin' now makes any sense?

01:23:10.340 --> 01:23:11.575
Fact is,

01:23:11.641 --> 01:23:13.044
when nothin' in the world
makes sense,

01:23:13.110 --> 01:23:15.679
it feels good
to just let it happen.

01:23:15.745 --> 01:23:19.016
It feels good to just ride
with the madness.

01:23:20.684 --> 01:23:22.452
And don't pretend
you don't know that.

01:23:22.519 --> 01:23:24.521
'Cause you know that better
than any of us.

01:23:26.456 --> 01:23:28.592
I know when enough is enough.

01:23:33.363 --> 01:23:36.833
Yeah, coming from you, that'd
be a hell of a thing to hear.

01:23:40.171 --> 01:23:44.541
What they need to hear...
is the truth.

01:23:48.246 --> 01:23:49.646
Yeah, that.

01:23:50.580 --> 01:23:52.616
Don't let me stop you.

01:23:56.519 --> 01:23:58.555
You can keep the keys.

01:25:28.212 --> 01:25:30.580
Y'all are makin' a big mistake,
you hear me?

01:25:30.647 --> 01:25:31.848
Y'all are makin' a big mistake!

01:25:31.916 --> 01:25:33.750
They ain't going to
take our jobs

01:25:33.817 --> 01:25:35.853
and they ain't takin' our factory!
They ain't doin' nothing!

01:25:36.486 --> 01:25:37.787
We gotta wait 'em out,

01:25:37.855 --> 01:25:39.689
Wait for the big news
trucks to come!

01:25:39.756 --> 01:25:42.759
You watch 'em!
You watch 'em shake then!

01:25:43.793 --> 01:25:45.729
All this work we've done...

01:25:45.795 --> 01:25:47.131
One more day
we can finish it!

01:25:47.198 --> 01:25:48.899
One more day
we prove we was right!

01:25:48.966 --> 01:25:51.102
We don't need the company!
We don't need nobody!

01:25:51.168 --> 01:25:54.504
Look, we stay here,
we become heroes, right?

01:25:54.571 --> 01:25:55.873
Heroes!

01:25:55.940 --> 01:25:58.209
We stay here we make them
give it all back!

01:26:00.144 --> 01:26:03.680
You leave now,
you leave as cowards!

01:26:04.647 --> 01:26:06.150
You hear me?

01:26:07.451 --> 01:26:09.020
Cowards!

01:26:10.553 --> 01:26:12.722
You leave as cowards!
You hear me?

01:26:26.203 --> 01:26:27.737
Shit!

01:26:28.906 --> 01:26:30.074
Shit!

01:26:43.553 --> 01:26:44.855
What's goin' on?

01:26:50.794 --> 01:26:53.663
So, what happened?

01:26:53.730 --> 01:26:56.467
You gotta give me something,
man. I'm dyin' out here...

01:26:56.534 --> 01:26:57.968
It's over.

01:27:14.085 --> 01:27:15.519
They made a deal.

01:27:15.585 --> 01:27:17.988
A deal?

01:27:18.055 --> 01:27:20.124
The company.

01:27:20.191 --> 01:27:21.459
They made an offer.

01:27:21.525 --> 01:27:22.993
To everyone.

01:27:23.994 --> 01:27:26.030
Isn't that what you wanted?

01:27:27.198 --> 01:27:29.500
Well it's...

01:27:29.567 --> 01:27:30.834
It's what they gave us.

01:27:30.901 --> 01:27:33.736
Well, what does Walter think?

01:27:33.803 --> 01:27:36.540
It doesn't matter.
The deal's done.

01:27:36.606 --> 01:27:37.807
Well, he must have an opinion.

01:27:37.875 --> 01:27:39.776
I mean, he's
helped to start all this.

01:27:39.843 --> 01:27:41.678
What he thinks doesn't matter.

01:27:41.744 --> 01:27:45.382
We took it.
It's over.

01:27:45.449 --> 01:27:49.887
It's... It's done.
And I... I...

01:27:51.088 --> 01:27:54.791
He's not who I...
He's not who I thought he was.

01:27:55.192 --> 01:27:56.527
I...

01:27:56.594 --> 01:27:58.496
I don't understand...

01:27:58.562 --> 01:28:00.598
Well, there are problems.

01:28:00.663 --> 01:28:04.268
He's got problems
that I didn't know about.

01:28:05.503 --> 01:28:07.037
He's just, um,

01:28:09.173 --> 01:28:09.940
I don't...

01:28:10.007 --> 01:28:13.010
He's just not right.

01:28:13.077 --> 01:28:15.812
He's not what
he's supposed to be.

01:28:15.880 --> 01:28:18.616
So you just left him?

01:28:18.681 --> 01:28:24.687
I told you, it's over.
The work was over...

01:28:24.754 --> 01:28:26.756
Yeah but he believed in you.
He helped you.

01:28:26.823 --> 01:28:29.360
I never asked for his help.

01:28:29.426 --> 01:28:30.760
Yeah but he gave you the...

01:28:30.827 --> 01:28:32.296
What you wanted.
You wanted the factory.

01:28:32.363 --> 01:28:34.697
He got the factory,
he gave you everyone's respect...

01:28:34.764 --> 01:28:36.733
The job... was not real.

01:28:38.768 --> 01:28:41.338
It was real!
It was real!

01:28:41.405 --> 01:28:43.307
All this talk
about Walter and his problems?

01:28:43.374 --> 01:28:45.943
Maybe you didn't know,
but I did.

01:28:46.010 --> 01:28:48.845
Do you know that night
at his house?

01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:51.982
I saw his medications.

01:28:52.049 --> 01:28:54.151
They were the same as Gabe's.

01:28:58.389 --> 01:29:00.658
Allery, doesn't that
feel familiar to you?

01:29:00.723 --> 01:29:02.660
I'm not talking
about this anymore.

01:29:02.725 --> 01:29:05.095
Don't you walk away from me!

01:29:05.162 --> 01:29:06.864
Not this time!

01:29:07.998 --> 01:29:12.835
You do. You just...
you just disappear!

01:29:13.803 --> 01:29:15.005
You're not there!

01:29:15.072 --> 01:29:16.240
I am!

01:29:17.707 --> 01:29:19.809
I was!

01:29:19.877 --> 01:29:22.613
I did what I needed to do.

01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:24.415
What is it
you needed to do?

01:29:25.349 --> 01:29:26.783
I needed to work!

01:29:26.849 --> 01:29:28.385
All you needed was to escape!

01:29:28.452 --> 01:29:30.955
That's what you would do.
Going to the factory!

01:29:31.021 --> 01:29:33.591
All those late night walks!

01:29:33.657 --> 01:29:35.359
You just didn't want to be here!

01:29:37.061 --> 01:29:38.862
You didn't want to be here.

01:29:38.929 --> 01:29:41.731
Gabe got sick,
and had to come home from school

01:29:41.798 --> 01:29:43.800
and he had to
leave his music...

01:29:43.867 --> 01:29:46.303
- He failed.
- He didn't fail.

01:29:46.370 --> 01:29:49.540
He was just afraid and he
needed you to talk to him.

01:29:49.607 --> 01:29:51.442
I was providing for us.

01:29:52.910 --> 01:29:55.312
So that we could
we take care of our son...

01:29:56.813 --> 01:30:00.084
And I was...
I don't know, I was...

01:30:03.187 --> 01:30:08.025
Allery,
I can't be dead anymore.

01:30:08.825 --> 01:30:10.294
I have to live.

01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:12.863
I have to be alive.

01:30:12.930 --> 01:30:15.299
Because that's
what's right for Gabe.

01:33:31.328 --> 01:33:32.596
Huh?

01:33:40.838 --> 01:33:42.372
I hear it.

01:33:50.882 --> 01:33:52.483
It's Walter.

01:33:53.952 --> 01:33:55.385
He didn't come home last night.

01:33:55.452 --> 01:33:58.055
The man ain't left
the factory yet.

01:33:58.622 --> 01:34:00.090
He's still there?

01:34:00.157 --> 01:34:01.860
The Sheriff's on
his way over there.

01:34:01.926 --> 01:34:04.896
Roger heard it on his scanner.

01:34:04.963 --> 01:34:06.230
Stan Gordman
called it in,

01:34:06.296 --> 01:34:07.464
he said Walter won't leave.

01:34:07.531 --> 01:34:08.999
Something's gone wrong, Allery.

01:34:09.066 --> 01:34:11.134
Walt's gotta get
the hell outta there.

01:34:13.604 --> 01:34:14.939
Allery.

01:34:15.005 --> 01:34:17.407
Allery, do you understand
what's happening?

01:34:17.474 --> 01:34:19.209
Allery, the law's
on their way over there.

01:34:19.276 --> 01:34:21.278
Someone's gonna get hurt.

01:34:27.751 --> 01:34:29.620
There needs to be more
than three in there.

01:34:29.686 --> 01:34:31.355
This guy is insane.

01:34:39.029 --> 01:34:41.398
- Wait!
- What the hell are you doing here, Parkes?

01:34:41.465 --> 01:34:42.867
I thought we resolved all this.

01:34:42.934 --> 01:34:44.268
No, no. Look.

01:34:44.334 --> 01:34:45.904
Let me go in.
Let me talk to him.

01:34:45.970 --> 01:34:47.271
Allery, you've already
done plenty.

01:34:47.337 --> 01:34:49.974
Don't do this.
Listen, just stand back

01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:51.608
and let these men do their jobs.

01:34:51.675 --> 01:34:53.577
This job isn't theirs!

01:34:56.079 --> 01:34:57.481
Please.

01:35:25.709 --> 01:35:27.311
Allery!

01:35:30.014 --> 01:35:31.615
Come here!

01:35:32.516 --> 01:35:34.986
We need these
orders filled today!

01:35:35.053 --> 01:35:36.119
Come on, I need you!

01:35:36.186 --> 01:35:37.588
Come on, we're behind!

01:35:39.323 --> 01:35:40.959
You hear me?
Well, come here, gimme a hand!

01:35:41.025 --> 01:35:42.693
- Okay here.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:35:44.094 --> 01:35:45.529
Gimme a hand!

01:35:46.229 --> 01:35:48.332
Hey, come on!

01:35:49.533 --> 01:35:51.535
It's a busy morning, huh?

01:35:51.602 --> 01:35:53.236
Damn sure it is!

01:35:54.906 --> 01:35:58.408
Hey, um, how bout we knock
off a few hours early?

01:36:00.410 --> 01:36:02.713
Today? Today's deadline!

01:36:02.779 --> 01:36:04.514
We got orders to meet!

01:36:05.950 --> 01:36:07.384
I know, it's just a break!

01:36:07.451 --> 01:36:09.020
You know, like we always do!

01:36:09.087 --> 01:36:10.554
Got no time for that!

01:36:11.488 --> 01:36:13.557
We gotta finish what
we started here!

01:36:15.359 --> 01:36:17.494
Wait, just listen to me!

01:36:19.998 --> 01:36:22.132
Wait, wait, wait a second!

01:36:22.199 --> 01:36:23.667
Wait, huh?

01:36:30.975 --> 01:36:32.376
We need to keep movin'!

01:36:33.176 --> 01:36:35.245
Can't take time to settle down!

01:36:36.213 --> 01:36:37.781
No!

01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:41.752
No!

01:36:42.519 --> 01:36:43.687
No!

01:36:44.388 --> 01:36:45.857
We don't belong here!

01:36:54.831 --> 01:36:57.567
We don't belong here!
Neither one of us!

01:37:11.748 --> 01:37:13.417
The work is over.

01:37:19.289 --> 01:37:20.858
It's time...

01:37:23.360 --> 01:37:25.662
It's time to move on, Walter.

01:37:36.074 --> 01:37:37.607
Now that's...

01:37:38.608 --> 01:37:40.811
the first time you've
called me by name.

01:37:40.878 --> 01:37:42.612
You know that?

01:39:21.245 --> 01:39:22.813
Not too long today, okay?

01:39:22.880 --> 01:39:24.548
All right.

01:39:34.859 --> 01:39:36.093
Lindbergh?

01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:37.794
Spirit of St. Louis.

01:39:39.163 --> 01:39:40.730
I brought your mail.

01:39:42.799 --> 01:39:45.502
In a couple of weeks
you'll be back home.

01:39:47.271 --> 01:39:51.042
This, uh...
This is also yours.

01:39:54.178 --> 01:39:55.745
From, uh, New Liberty.

01:39:56.580 --> 01:39:58.515
From Corporate.

01:39:59.884 --> 01:40:00.952
Is it a summons?

01:40:01.018 --> 01:40:02.352
It's a check.

01:40:02.419 --> 01:40:04.554
For your labor...

01:40:04.621 --> 01:40:06.756
plus a brokerage fee.

01:40:09.060 --> 01:40:11.329
A few of our former buyers,
the ones that you called,

01:40:11.394 --> 01:40:13.697
they caught wind of what
we had done at the factory,

01:40:13.763 --> 01:40:18.035
they contacted the head office
and bought up a lot of a...

01:40:18.936 --> 01:40:21.239
work we did.

01:40:21.305 --> 01:40:23.740
They bought our work.

01:40:23.807 --> 01:40:27.945
Factory's still closing
but you were right, Walter.

01:40:28.012 --> 01:40:29.779
They wanted our work.

01:40:32.682 --> 01:40:34.484
You were right.

01:40:40.557 --> 01:40:43.327
That wife of yours make
anymore of that peach pie?

01:40:43.393 --> 01:40:44.527
Oh, yeah.

01:40:44.594 --> 01:40:46.964
Plus a few other things.

01:40:47.031 --> 01:40:48.665
You know she spoils me.

01:40:49.367 --> 01:40:50.533
Yes.

01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:55.805
Well... best we eat it.

01:40:58.408 --> 01:41:00.111
Hate to disappoint
the poor woman.

01:41:04.614 --> 01:41:09.353
Don't get any pie
on your brokerage fee.

01:41:32.842 --> 01:41:34.678
Did I give you
enough time with him?

01:41:34.744 --> 01:41:36.914
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:41:40.617 --> 01:41:42.719
Would you like me...

01:41:42.786 --> 01:41:45.289
Would you like me to drive?

01:41:45.356 --> 01:41:47.258
- Yes.
- Is that a yes?

01:41:47.325 --> 01:41:48.993
- Hm.
- Yeah?

01:43:09.823 --> 01:43:12.372
