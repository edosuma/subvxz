09:55.891 --> 09:57.695
The helmet cam footage.

10:01.936 --> 10:03.472
It's a little choppy, and
at the end it gets a little‐‐

10:03.472 --> 10:05.677
Please, just play it.

10:07.948 --> 10:10.086
(beeps, engine revving)

10:10.086 --> 10:12.256
(Murtaugh grunts)

10:12.256 --> 10:13.827
(tires screeching)

10:16.164 --> 10:18.102
Doc, you don't have to do this.

10:18.102 --> 10:19.972
Yes, I do.

10:27.521 --> 10:29.792
(vehicle approaching)

10:40.346 --> 10:41.916
I saw a plate.

10:41.916 --> 10:42.918
Play that back.

10:45.289 --> 10:46.959
(elevator bell dings)

10:50.332 --> 10:53.038
MURTAUGH:
Zoom in on that.

10:53.038 --> 10:54.474
Okay. Enhance that.

10:54.474 --> 10:57.079
AVERY: Let's find out
who that truck is registered to

10:57.079 --> 10:59.785
and get a BOLO on that license
plate right away.

11:06.164 --> 11:07.568
Hey, watch your door.

11:07.568 --> 11:10.272
Don't want to cause any
more property damage.

11:15.015 --> 11:17.486
There it is.

11:20.861 --> 11:23.398
Busted headlight.

11:24.400 --> 11:25.804
Engine's still warm, Riggs.

11:39.899 --> 11:41.134
Are you asking
permission now?

11:41.134 --> 11:43.640
I was wondering it maybe you
would like to kick the door in.

11:43.640 --> 11:46.211
I don't want to
kick the door in.

11:46.211 --> 11:47.547
Let me check the door.
(door creaking)

12:00.974 --> 12:01.909
Clear.

12:03.546 --> 12:05.817
Clear.

12:10.459 --> 12:12.463
MURTAUGH:
Our guy's into photography?

12:18.208 --> 12:19.611
Crap.

12:19.611 --> 12:21.949
What, it's not our guy?

12:28.328 --> 12:30.834
Sean Hawkins wasn't the target.

12:49.370 --> 12:51.575
There's dozens of pictures
on that camera.

12:51.575 --> 12:53.646
This creep has been
watching her for weeks now.

12:53.646 --> 12:55.683
I'm bringing in
all available resources‐‐

12:55.683 --> 12:57.687
threat‐management unit,
dedicated forensics team...

12:57.687 --> 12:59.290
We're gonna need to look
at her patients, too.

12:59.290 --> 13:00.392
Already into it.
We brought in

13:00.392 --> 13:01.729
what's called
a "Special Master."

13:01.729 --> 13:03.966
You made that up.
That's a real thing?
It's a real thing.

13:03.966 --> 13:05.937
An outside shrink who can
review her patients

13:05.937 --> 13:07.440
on our behalf while
protecting their privacy.

13:07.440 --> 13:10.279
An outside shrink
looking at Cahill's files?

13:10.279 --> 13:11.582
Is she gonna be okay with that?

13:11.582 --> 13:12.651
She's worked with him before.

13:12.651 --> 13:15.255
I'd say she's okay...ish.

13:15.255 --> 13:17.359
What the hell is he doing
in my office?

13:17.359 --> 13:20.667
Maureen, I know that this
must be disruptive to you.

13:20.667 --> 13:23.238
Ronald, you have no idea
how disruptive this is.

13:23.238 --> 13:24.575
Let's all try and play nice.

13:24.575 --> 13:26.177
I have police at my house,

13:26.177 --> 13:28.181
everyone around here is
looking at me sideways,

13:28.181 --> 13:29.585
and now he is
invading my space.

13:29.585 --> 13:31.387
Maureen, there is no scenario

13:31.387 --> 13:33.391
in which you can review
your own patient files

13:33.391 --> 13:35.229
to determine who is
and who is not a suspect.

13:35.229 --> 13:37.099
We need Dr. Levinson here.

13:37.099 --> 13:39.303
I am just trying to help.

13:42.042 --> 13:43.579
Who are we looking for?

13:43.579 --> 13:46.986
Uh, well, based
on the photographs,

13:46.986 --> 13:48.188
someone who's intrusive.

13:48.188 --> 13:50.058
And the flowers,
an unwanted gift,

13:50.058 --> 13:52.329
demonstrate that
they want your attention.

13:54.433 --> 13:57.439
You've deduced
I have a stalker. Wow.

13:57.439 --> 14:00.112
Maureen, you're
a great psychiatrist.

14:00.112 --> 14:01.214
No one is questioning that.

14:01.214 --> 14:03.351
But the‐the procedure in
these types of situations...

14:03.351 --> 14:05.557
You know what, just...
just get on with it.

14:06.659 --> 14:09.631
Well, I've already found
a former patient

14:09.631 --> 14:11.401
that I think is
a viable suspect.

14:11.401 --> 14:12.704
You already have someone?

14:12.704 --> 14:14.508
Yes, an ex‐con
named Kevin Flynn.

14:14.508 --> 14:15.643
It's not him.

14:15.643 --> 14:17.547
Dr. Cahill treated him
in a prisoner‐release program.

14:17.547 --> 14:19.317
You know, you were always
a little too quick

14:19.317 --> 14:20.452
to give your diagnosis.

14:20.452 --> 14:22.122
AVERY: What is it
about Kevin Flynn

14:22.122 --> 14:24.728
that makes you think
he might fit the bill here?

14:24.728 --> 14:27.333
Well, I guess it's how
he threatened to kill her.

14:27.333 --> 14:28.669
One time.

14:28.669 --> 14:29.605
After Dr. Cahill

14:29.605 --> 14:31.140
recommended to deny his parole,

14:31.140 --> 14:34.213
he lunged across the
courtroom, and he shouted,

14:34.213 --> 14:36.986
"I will gut you like a fish."

14:38.221 --> 14:39.558
It still isn't him.

14:40.526 --> 14:41.562
Okay, well, I'm gonna have

14:41.562 --> 14:43.231
Riggs and Murtaugh look into it,

14:43.231 --> 14:46.037
just to be sure.
They're gonna need backup.

14:46.037 --> 14:47.072
Riggs and Murtaugh?

14:48.141 --> 14:50.178
I'll float that by them.

14:50.178 --> 14:51.515
(mouths words)

14:53.118 --> 14:54.320
(knocking)

14:58.128 --> 15:00.733
Are you Kevin Flynn?

15:00.733 --> 15:02.303
Yeah, what the hell
do you want?

15:02.303 --> 15:05.142
Um...
Is there maybe another
Kevin Flynn inside there?

15:05.142 --> 15:06.512
Like, a bigger one
or something?

15:06.512 --> 15:08.248
Or is Snow White around?

15:08.248 --> 15:10.352
Look, uh, we are LAPD,

15:10.352 --> 15:12.757
and we want to ask
you some questions.

15:12.757 --> 15:13.759
Sure, yeah, come on in.

15:13.759 --> 15:15.630
It's not like
it's America or anything.

15:15.630 --> 15:17.499
MURTAUGH: Have you
had any contact

15:17.499 --> 15:19.070
with Dr. Maureen Cahill lately?

15:19.070 --> 15:21.274
Dr. Cahill?
(laughs)

15:21.274 --> 15:24.280
Uh, no.
Well, maybe.

15:24.280 --> 15:26.150
Uh, does leaving a message
every week telling her

15:26.150 --> 15:27.453
I hate her damn guts

15:27.453 --> 15:29.658
and I want her dead
count as contact?

15:29.658 --> 15:32.697
You guys work with her.
Leave her a message for me.

15:32.697 --> 15:35.268
Die a slow, miserable death,

15:35.268 --> 15:37.707
and then rot in hell, bitch!

15:37.707 --> 15:38.676
Okay, I think
we're all done here.

15:38.676 --> 15:42.517
All right, Tweedle Dee,
give me your hand...

15:42.517 --> 15:44.420
Hey, stop it,
stop it, quit.

15:44.420 --> 15:47.493
Stop! Stop! No! Quit!
(gasping)

15:47.493 --> 15:49.163
I'm gonna kill you!
Ow! Quit it!

15:59.785 --> 16:03.759
Okay, so I think it's safe to
say we got the right guy.

16:03.759 --> 16:05.162

16:18.823 --> 16:20.425
Get off me!

16:20.425 --> 16:22.329
I'm gonna kill you!

16:22.329 --> 16:24.166
She ruined my life.

16:24.166 --> 16:25.536
I spent a year in jail
'cause of her.

16:25.536 --> 16:26.705
You want to act like an animal?

16:26.705 --> 16:30.312
Then I will treat you
like an animal.

16:30.312 --> 16:31.715
Stupid cops!
Nine seconds.

16:31.715 --> 16:33.051
That's a personal best.

16:34.688 --> 16:36.692
MURTAUGH:
<i>Kevin,</i>

16:36.692 --> 16:39.163
you have no alibi
for Monday morning.

16:39.163 --> 16:41.300
Admit that you ran
Sean Hawkins off the road,

16:41.300 --> 16:42.737
and we'll send you back
to the nice little prison

16:42.737 --> 16:44.340
that I think
you want to be in.

16:44.340 --> 16:45.910
FLYNN: Lawyer.
I told you, he didn't do it.

16:45.910 --> 16:48.682
The fact that he assaulted
two detectives says otherwise.

16:48.682 --> 16:51.688
Guy's as guilty
as it gets.

16:52.690 --> 16:54.260
What's she doing?

16:54.260 --> 16:56.297
I don't know.

16:56.297 --> 16:58.268
Hey, Kevin.

16:58.268 --> 16:59.504
So...

16:59.504 --> 17:00.706
I got your messages.

17:00.706 --> 17:03.646
I haven't been able
to get back to you.

17:03.646 --> 17:04.848
But you know I won't.

17:04.848 --> 17:06.552
Right?
What are you doing here?

17:06.552 --> 17:08.822
Saving us all some time.

17:10.693 --> 17:12.697
Did you kill a man
on Monday morning?

17:12.697 --> 17:14.366
I'm gonna kill you once I‐‐

17:14.366 --> 17:16.270
No, you're not.

17:16.270 --> 17:17.874
You're a paranoid‐aggressive,

17:17.874 --> 17:19.878
and you threaten‐‐
that's your thing.

17:19.878 --> 17:22.684
So where were you
Monday morning?

17:22.684 --> 17:24.688
I don't have to tell you.

17:24.688 --> 17:28.696
No, but you want to.

17:28.696 --> 17:30.231
You don't want
to go back to prison,

17:30.231 --> 17:31.802
because then who would
take care of Nana?

17:33.739 --> 17:36.778
Is that what you
don't want to admit?

17:36.778 --> 17:39.183
You were with Nana on Monday,

17:39.183 --> 17:41.555
weren't you?

17:41.555 --> 17:43.291
She needs me.

17:43.291 --> 17:45.295
You don't understand.

17:45.295 --> 17:46.397
I understand.

17:46.397 --> 17:47.667
We'll check with
the floor nurse.

17:47.667 --> 17:48.869
I'm sure she'll
vouch for you.

17:50.673 --> 17:52.242
I told you,
he's not guilty.

17:52.242 --> 17:53.378
You were right, but we
still have to do our job.

17:53.378 --> 17:54.413
Where are you going?

17:54.413 --> 17:55.415
Home.
We still have to make sure

17:55.415 --> 17:57.654
your home is secure‐‐
Maureen!

18:15.388 --> 18:18.394
(sighs)

18:18.394 --> 18:20.533
Huh.

18:20.533 --> 18:23.939
That was a long,
silent car ride.

18:23.939 --> 18:25.643
Now I know how
Murtaugh feels.

18:27.680 --> 18:30.886
Look, I can find this guy.

18:30.886 --> 18:31.855
But you've got to trust me,

18:31.855 --> 18:32.757
and you've got to
tell me what you know.

18:32.757 --> 18:35.295
What is it you think
I'm not telling you?

18:35.295 --> 18:37.165
I don't know, because you're
not telling me anything.

18:38.569 --> 18:40.506
Welcome to my world, Riggs.

18:43.779 --> 18:46.685
Thank you for the ride.

18:54.433 --> 18:55.569
Stay in the car.

18:55.569 --> 18:57.339
Lock the doors.

19:09.831 --> 19:12.302
(footsteps)

19:14.006 --> 19:16.310
(groaning)

19:16.310 --> 19:17.880
Please don't hurt me!
What are you doing here?

19:17.880 --> 19:20.351
What am I...?
This is my house.

19:20.351 --> 19:22.523
What?

19:22.523 --> 19:23.792
Oh, God...

19:23.792 --> 19:25.729
Maureen, what the hell?!

19:25.729 --> 19:28.569
You know this guy?
It's my husband.

19:30.739 --> 19:32.677
Hit him again.

19:33.477 --> 19:34.614
(whimpers)

19:37.419 --> 19:40.759
How did you get in?
I have keys

19:40.759 --> 19:42.830
is how I got in.
Yes, and I want them back.

19:42.830 --> 19:45.001
So leave the keys and go.
It's my house.

19:45.001 --> 19:47.607
Only because you haven't
signed the damn papers, Brad.

19:49.042 --> 19:52.382
So why today,
Bradley?

19:52.382 --> 19:54.419
Why today did you decide,

19:54.419 --> 19:56.390
"I'm just gonna
pop in on my ex‐wife

19:56.390 --> 19:57.526
and scare the hell
out of her"?

19:57.526 --> 20:00.766
I wasn't trying to scare anyone.

20:00.766 --> 20:01.835
I was worried.

20:01.835 --> 20:04.406
I heard from the neighbors
that the police were here.

20:04.406 --> 20:05.408
Now I find out you have
a stalker,

20:05.408 --> 20:06.343
and someone was attacked.

20:06.343 --> 20:07.880
Oh, no, no, no, no,
someone was killed.

20:07.880 --> 20:11.621
Where were you yesterday
morning, Bradley?

20:13.825 --> 20:16.831
You think I...
(laughs)

20:16.831 --> 20:17.700
Are you serious?

20:17.700 --> 20:19.771
Usually not so much,
but right now, yeah.

20:19.771 --> 20:22.375
At work.
You can call my boss.

20:22.375 --> 20:24.781
So who was he?

20:24.781 --> 20:26.116
The guy who was killed.

20:26.116 --> 20:26.952
Were you dating him?

20:26.952 --> 20:29.991
(scoffs)
Oh, I don't believe this.

20:29.991 --> 20:32.596
Y‐You're not worried
I have a stalker.

20:32.596 --> 20:34.667
You're worried
I'm dating?

20:34.667 --> 20:35.602
Leave.

20:35.602 --> 20:38.542
I'm here because I care.

20:38.542 --> 20:40.178
Look, I get it,
Maureen.

20:40.178 --> 20:41.514
You're still angry about Vegas.

20:41.514 --> 20:42.717
It was one night.

20:42.717 --> 20:44.186
It was more than one night.

20:44.186 --> 20:46.056
You know what?

20:46.056 --> 20:48.895
You both need to leave now.

20:48.895 --> 20:51.033
Let's go.

20:51.033 --> 20:52.202
And if he turns around,

20:52.202 --> 20:54.540
you have my permission
to shoot him.

20:55.943 --> 20:58.214
Wow, she almost never
gives me permission

20:58.214 --> 21:00.919
to do that, Bradley.

21:23.164 --> 21:24.901
Oh...

21:24.901 --> 21:26.638
What are you doing?

21:26.638 --> 21:29.510
I'm just... putting, uh

21:29.510 --> 21:31.046
Riana's clothes away.

21:31.046 --> 21:32.917
In her desk drawer?

21:34.620 --> 21:36.390
Are you searching her room?

21:38.094 --> 21:40.632
It's against everything
I stand for, but yes.

21:40.632 --> 21:43.538
Okay, in that case,
what'd you find?

21:44.473 --> 21:46.043
She has a license?

21:46.043 --> 21:48.114
I don't remember teaching that
girl how to drive, do you?

21:48.114 --> 21:49.149
No, I do not.

21:49.149 --> 21:50.552
However, I do recall

21:50.552 --> 21:51.955
her being born
in this century.

21:51.955 --> 21:53.959
Look at this‐‐ 1995?

21:53.959 --> 21:55.696
Ninety fi... she is in

21:55.696 --> 21:56.764
a world of...
(door closes)

21:56.764 --> 21:57.600
RIANA:
Mom?

21:57.600 --> 21:58.869
Dad? I'm home.

21:58.869 --> 22:01.039
Roger...

22:01.039 --> 22:02.442
What? We in the clo‐‐

22:02.442 --> 22:03.979
Shh.

22:03.979 --> 22:05.849
Mom?

22:05.849 --> 22:07.520
That's twice
in one day.

22:07.520 --> 22:09.524
Oh, my gosh,
what are we doing, Roger?

22:09.524 --> 22:12.730
Is this our low point
as parents?

22:12.730 --> 22:14.667
I think it just got lower.

22:14.667 --> 22:17.172
What are you doing
in my closet?

22:17.172 --> 22:20.679
Honey, uh,
your father and I‐‐

22:20.679 --> 22:22.683
look, we've been
worried about you.

22:22.683 --> 22:24.954
And we were wondering,
is there anything

22:24.954 --> 22:26.156
that you want to say...?

22:26.156 --> 22:27.258
What is this?

22:27.258 --> 22:29.697
I'll tell you
what is is.

22:29.697 --> 22:32.001
It's a fake I. D.
Why do you have this?

22:33.270 --> 22:35.208
I got a job.

22:35.208 --> 22:37.947
I've been working
for some DJs

22:37.947 --> 22:39.584
who helped me book
some small gigs,

22:39.584 --> 22:41.754
but I need the I. D.
to get into the clubs.

22:41.754 --> 22:43.558
A job?

22:43.558 --> 22:44.794
Why didn't you tell us?

22:44.794 --> 22:47.065
Maybe I thought
you guys would freak out,

22:47.065 --> 22:51.541
interrogate my friends,
ransack my closet.

22:54.212 --> 22:56.049
Do you mind getting out my room?

22:57.118 --> 22:58.020
Okay.

22:58.020 --> 23:00.057
We'll be...
The door is over there.

23:00.057 --> 23:00.993
Okay.
Love you.

23:00.993 --> 23:04.099
All righty.
Oh, you're gonna walk us out.

23:04.099 --> 23:05.268
Yeah.
RIANA:
Yes, thank you.

23:05.268 --> 23:07.005
All right. Mm‐hmm.
Okay.

23:07.005 --> 23:08.808
So, uh...

23:10.879 --> 23:13.718
MURTAUGH (chuckling):
<i>Cahill is married?</i>

23:13.718 --> 23:15.021
Yep. A real live husband.

23:15.021 --> 23:16.991
Just sitting at the house
waiting on her.

23:16.991 --> 23:18.160
That's super creepy.

23:18.160 --> 23:19.830
Top of the suspect list
creepy.

23:19.830 --> 23:21.734
MURTAUGH:
Cahill's married.

23:21.734 --> 23:23.237
Hey, how you doing there,
Other‐Doc?

23:23.237 --> 23:24.674
Hey.
What you got?

23:24.674 --> 23:26.009
Well, a lot more now.

23:26.009 --> 23:27.613
I just finished your file.

23:28.882 --> 23:31.621
Well, I mean,
she makes all that stuff up.

23:31.621 --> 23:32.756
I'm pretty sure.

23:32.756 --> 23:34.125
So, uh, you've known

23:34.125 --> 23:35.227
the doctor for a while.

23:35.227 --> 23:36.731
You know her
on a personal level.

23:36.731 --> 23:38.167
Do you know anything
about her ex‐husband?

23:38.167 --> 23:40.171
Brad?
Brad.

23:40.171 --> 23:41.574
Well, I went to their wedding.

23:41.574 --> 23:43.878
He kept dancing
with all the bridesmaids.

23:43.878 --> 23:45.281
I couldn't see him
as a spouse.

23:45.281 --> 23:46.951
Can you see him as a stalker?

23:46.951 --> 23:47.953
Interesting.

23:47.953 --> 23:50.659
L‐Let's ponder that
when I get back, huh?

23:50.659 --> 23:52.362
And you're Murtaugh, right?

23:52.362 --> 23:53.832
R.M. Murtaugh?

23:53.832 --> 23:55.167
Roger Mayfield. Yeah, why?

23:55.167 --> 23:57.071
Yeah, no reason.

23:58.675 --> 23:59.977
You see the way
he looked me?

23:59.977 --> 24:02.850
He read my file.
That's what that was.

24:02.850 --> 24:05.154
Everybody knows
what's in that file.

24:05.154 --> 24:06.758
I feel left out.

24:06.758 --> 24:08.193
No, no. What‐‐
what are you doing, Riggs?

24:08.193 --> 24:10.297
Listen, there's a wealth
of information inside here.

24:10.297 --> 24:11.299
Outside of your file,

24:11.299 --> 24:13.638
with potential suspects. I‐‐

24:13.638 --> 24:15.107
What are you doing?

24:15.107 --> 24:16.778
Uh, we are just...
Not breaking and entering.

24:16.778 --> 24:17.880
We were running, uh,
an inspection.

24:17.880 --> 24:19.984
Yes. Yeah.
Like a field test,
on the door, to see

24:19.984 --> 24:21.319
how secure it was.
(knocks)
It secure?

24:21.319 --> 24:22.355
(phone buzzes)
(groans)

24:22.355 --> 24:23.625
It feels good.
Yep?

24:23.625 --> 24:24.693
Yeah, looks good.
Brad?

24:24.693 --> 24:26.229
Maureen, where are you?

24:26.229 --> 24:27.599
What are you talking about?

24:27.599 --> 24:28.735
You texted me to meet you

24:28.735 --> 24:30.070
outside City Hall at noon.

24:30.070 --> 24:31.607
Are you blowing me off?

24:31.607 --> 24:33.912
Brad's across the street.

24:33.912 --> 24:35.381
He said I asked
to meet him for lunch,

24:35.381 --> 24:36.283
but I never reached out to him.

24:36.283 --> 24:37.719
Tell him
we're on our way.

24:37.719 --> 24:40.057
(horns honking)

24:42.128 --> 24:44.299
CAHILL:
He's in front of City Hall!

24:44.299 --> 24:45.234
Rog, stay with her.

24:45.234 --> 24:46.971
(horn blaring)

24:53.217 --> 24:54.954
(grunts)

24:55.889 --> 24:56.757
Hey!

24:58.126 --> 24:59.262
(horn blaring)

24:59.262 --> 25:00.999
Ah!

25:00.999 --> 25:01.868
Hey, whoa, whoa!

25:01.868 --> 25:03.136
(grunts)

25:03.136 --> 25:04.038
Hey!

25:09.382 --> 25:11.152
(air hissing)

25:11.152 --> 25:13.357
(screeching)

25:13.357 --> 25:14.894
(air hisses)

25:14.894 --> 25:17.799
WOMAN:
Did you see that?!

25:19.035 --> 25:22.074
MAN:
Hey, hey! He's got a gun!

25:22.074 --> 25:23.110
(crowd clamoring)

25:23.110 --> 25:25.147
Hey, there, Bradley.

25:28.855 --> 25:32.729
If I was you, I'd sign
those divorce papers.

25:36.002 --> 25:38.741
Either he's not our guy,
or he threw himself

25:38.741 --> 25:40.010
in front of a moving truck
to convince us

25:40.010 --> 25:41.279
that he's not our guy.

25:41.279 --> 25:42.315
Consider me convinced.

25:42.315 --> 25:44.385
Any luck with
security cameras?
Not so much.

25:44.385 --> 25:46.022
Whoever pushed Brad
has his back

25:46.022 --> 25:47.091
to the only camera
that spotted him.

25:47.091 --> 25:48.460
Do we have anything on this?

25:48.460 --> 25:51.399
Bailey's gonna hit you up
to expense a DNA test.

25:51.399 --> 25:52.435
DNA from what?

25:52.435 --> 25:53.905
For the saliva used

25:53.905 --> 25:55.809
to seal the envelope
that came with the flowers

25:55.809 --> 25:56.844
delivered to Cahill.

25:56.844 --> 25:58.848
Well, good, I was worried
it was a long shot.

25:58.848 --> 26:00.217
What about Dr. Cahill?

26:00.217 --> 26:01.988
As difficult as it is
for her to accept,

26:01.988 --> 26:03.357
she needs to have
a protective detail.

26:03.357 --> 26:05.027
We got our eye on her.

26:16.751 --> 26:19.022
(can sprays)

26:20.057 --> 26:21.059
Sir?

26:21.059 --> 26:22.261
The, uh, lady inside

26:22.261 --> 26:25.034
asked if you'd come in
and join her.

26:33.383 --> 26:35.154
(indistinct chatter)

26:40.230 --> 26:41.901
They brought that
by mistake.

26:41.901 --> 26:43.838
I couldn't let
it go to waste.

26:46.242 --> 26:49.082
That is a good looking
chicken parm.

26:52.421 --> 26:54.960
I mean, the edges are...
I mean, they're perfect.

26:54.960 --> 26:56.897
It's my burden.

26:56.897 --> 27:01.406
I am professionally obligated
to listen to everything you say.

27:04.178 --> 27:06.316
Nice place.

27:06.316 --> 27:07.786
You come here a lot?

27:07.786 --> 27:08.921
Special occasions.

27:08.921 --> 27:10.925
Oh, yeah?

27:10.925 --> 27:12.061
So what's this one?

27:12.061 --> 27:16.069
That your ex escaped a date
with a truck?

27:16.069 --> 27:18.206
Or were you rooting
for the truck?

27:18.206 --> 27:19.108
No.

27:21.146 --> 27:22.181
Mostly no.

27:25.354 --> 27:26.891
He cheated on me.

27:26.891 --> 27:29.462
More than once.

27:29.462 --> 27:31.099
I kind of put that together.

27:31.967 --> 27:33.971
And he lied about it.

27:35.374 --> 27:39.348
So well, in fact,
that it made me crazy.

27:39.348 --> 27:41.520
But that part goes away
when you learn the truth.

27:41.520 --> 27:45.260
What doesn't go away is how
you start looking at everyone

27:45.260 --> 27:47.398
like you're just waiting
for them to hurt you.

27:49.302 --> 27:51.306
Took me a while
to get out of that head space,

27:51.306 --> 27:53.043
before I could even think
about dating.

27:54.813 --> 27:56.282
And Sean was the first.

27:56.282 --> 27:58.420
Mm‐hmm.

27:58.420 --> 28:01.426
Hardest thing in the world
is to trust other people.

28:01.426 --> 28:03.396
Yeah.

28:07.873 --> 28:09.208
♪ If I held your hand... ♪

28:09.208 --> 28:12.114
Pretend you're interested.

28:14.252 --> 28:17.258
(stammers)
I'm interested.

28:17.258 --> 28:18.493
Um, as far as...

28:18.493 --> 28:20.197
No, no, no. Not for me.

28:20.197 --> 28:22.903
Um, we're at
my favorite restaurant,

28:22.903 --> 28:25.474
having what looks
like a romantic meal

28:25.474 --> 28:27.144
and if he's watching...

28:27.144 --> 28:30.050
Then you're trying
to make him jealous.

28:30.050 --> 28:32.956
My ex‐husband,

28:32.956 --> 28:34.258
man I was dating,

28:34.258 --> 28:37.933
he's obsessively going after
people he sees as competition.

28:40.304 --> 28:42.074
So you're using me as bait,

28:42.074 --> 28:45.180
in hopes that
he tries to kill me.

28:45.180 --> 28:47.552
I couldn't think
of anyone better.

28:47.552 --> 28:49.990
Oh, Doc.

28:52.061 --> 28:53.531
You are listening, aren't you?

28:56.069 --> 28:57.939
(camera snapping)

29:15.608 --> 29:18.079
(Riggs grunts)

29:28.934 --> 29:30.404
Kick his ass.

29:31.472 --> 29:32.575
Oh, and, um,

29:32.575 --> 29:35.180
tell Murtaugh to get out
of my neighbor's driveway.

29:35.180 --> 29:38.119
With any luck,
you'll need the help, not me.

29:44.098 --> 29:46.436
Hey, Rog. Doc made you.

29:46.436 --> 29:48.239
Well, who wouldn't stand out

29:48.239 --> 29:49.676
in this ridiculous truck?

29:49.676 --> 29:52.014
(Riggs chuckles)
Don't worry.
I got my eye on her.

29:52.014 --> 29:53.450
Happy hunting.

30:05.541 --> 30:07.244
How is she?

30:07.244 --> 30:08.948
She's fine.

30:08.948 --> 30:11.119
She's eating ice cream.

30:12.956 --> 30:14.325
I wish I had some ice cream.

30:15.293 --> 30:17.231
Hey, how was that chicken parm?

30:17.231 --> 30:19.703
If it was my last meal,

30:19.703 --> 30:20.705
I'd die a happy man.

30:20.705 --> 30:24.546
You know what else would
help me die a happy man?

30:24.546 --> 30:26.249
Tell me why
you went to Cahill's.

30:28.119 --> 30:31.159
Come on, Rog, don't send me
to the grave not knowing.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.670
Three years ago,

30:36.670 --> 30:40.110
Avery and I raided
a meth house in East L. A.

30:40.110 --> 30:43.249
We grabbed two gangbangers.

30:43.249 --> 30:45.688
There was a third one
hiding in a closet.

30:45.688 --> 30:48.493
He had Avery dead to rights,
gun to his head.

30:48.493 --> 30:52.301
And I had him dead to rights.

30:52.301 --> 30:56.577
Avery gave me the signal,
and, uh...

30:58.046 --> 30:59.816
...I froze.

30:59.816 --> 31:01.520
What signal?

31:01.520 --> 31:02.387
We had a signal.

31:02.387 --> 31:04.191
Two taps on the shoulder meant

31:04.191 --> 31:06.095
shoot the guy
if he has a gun on you.

31:06.095 --> 31:07.331
Why don't we have a signal?

31:07.331 --> 31:10.538
(laughs) Because you always
shoot the guy.

31:10.538 --> 31:13.611
We'd need a signal to say,
"Hey, don't shoot the guy."

31:15.347 --> 31:17.050
Anyway, I couldn't do it.

31:17.050 --> 31:18.554
(engine revving)

31:18.554 --> 31:20.457
I was afraid
I was gonna hit Avery.

31:22.227 --> 31:23.664
I froze up.

31:23.664 --> 31:27.471
Avery finally
talked the guy down, but, um...

31:30.578 --> 31:34.485
...well, this one had
collateral damage.

31:34.485 --> 31:38.159
It bled into other areas
of my life.

31:41.265 --> 31:44.238
Intimate areas of my life.

31:45.541 --> 31:46.677
With Trish.

31:49.181 --> 31:51.285
Wow.

31:51.285 --> 31:52.421
I'm sorry, man.

31:52.421 --> 31:54.659
(chuckles)
That you asked?

31:54.659 --> 31:57.297
No, uh, you know...

31:57.297 --> 31:59.234
that it bled.

31:59.234 --> 32:01.105
That's why I went
to see Cahill.

32:01.105 --> 32:04.078
Happy ending‐‐
it all worked out.

32:04.078 --> 32:08.052
Nine months later,
bam, Harper.

32:08.052 --> 32:09.254
(phone buzzing)

32:09.254 --> 32:10.758
Hold on second,
I got another call.

32:10.758 --> 32:12.127
It's Bailey.

32:12.127 --> 32:13.463
Hey, what's up, Bailey?

32:13.463 --> 32:16.503
That long shot DNA test,
not such a long shot.

32:16.503 --> 32:18.640
I got a match.
Who?

32:18.640 --> 32:20.410
Dr. Levinson.

32:27.457 --> 32:29.294
Ron?

32:32.869 --> 32:34.773
Hey, I'm two minutes out.
Maybe less. What do you see?

32:34.773 --> 32:35.775
Make it less.

32:35.775 --> 32:37.144
<i>He's in the house.</i>

32:37.144 --> 32:38.479
No one told me you were coming.

32:38.479 --> 32:40.785
Well, someone from
the department called me,

32:40.785 --> 32:42.722
and told me to meet you here,
bring the files.

32:42.722 --> 32:43.824
Really? Who?

32:43.824 --> 32:44.759
I don't remember.

32:44.759 --> 32:46.763
Is that important?
I came all the way here

32:46.763 --> 32:48.266
to see you.

32:48.266 --> 32:49.602
(phone ringing)

32:55.548 --> 32:56.482
Hello?

32:56.482 --> 32:57.752
It's Dr. Levinson.

32:57.752 --> 32:59.522
<i>Walk out of that house</i>
<i>right now.</i>

32:59.522 --> 33:01.526
We have a positive DNA match.

33:02.829 --> 33:04.833
It's him. Now, go.

33:04.833 --> 33:07.572
Tuesday. Yeah, uh, absolutely.
I'll just,

33:07.572 --> 33:08.707
I'll just move some
things around. Sure.

33:08.707 --> 33:09.843
Hey, who... where‐where
are you going?

33:09.843 --> 33:12.214
Um, I‐I don't get
good service here,

33:12.214 --> 33:14.218
so I'm just gonna go outside.
No, no, Maureen,
I‐I can't let you go.

33:14.218 --> 33:17.290
The stalker
could be out there.
Ron, get out of my way.

33:17.290 --> 33:18.794
Maureen, I'm trying
to protect you.

33:18.794 --> 33:20.731
(gunshot)

33:23.804 --> 33:24.739
Shots fired!

33:24.739 --> 33:26.776
Levinson is down.
You got eyes on Cahill?

33:26.776 --> 33:27.912
She's still in there

33:27.912 --> 33:30.416
<i>with... Montero?</i>

33:30.416 --> 33:32.187
Are you all right, ma'am?

33:32.187 --> 33:34.191
(heavy breathing)

33:34.191 --> 33:35.393
What's going on?

33:36.897 --> 33:38.567
I...

33:38.567 --> 33:40.236
I worked with him.
I can't believe he...

33:40.236 --> 33:42.440
It's all okay.

33:42.440 --> 33:44.546
I'm here to protect
you, Dr. Cahill.

33:45.915 --> 33:47.350
I know you.

33:49.956 --> 33:51.425
I was hoping you would.

33:54.599 --> 33:56.670
It's been a long time
since we were together.

33:57.772 --> 33:59.709
"Together"?

33:59.709 --> 34:01.680
(tires screech)

34:07.525 --> 34:09.328
You were a patient.

34:09.328 --> 34:11.198
I treated you
months ago.

34:11.198 --> 34:12.300
And now I'm here...

34:14.338 --> 34:16.643
...just in time.

34:18.346 --> 34:20.350
How we doing here, guys?

34:21.251 --> 34:22.320
You okay?

34:22.320 --> 34:24.424
No. No, not even close.

34:24.424 --> 34:26.529
(gas hissing)

34:36.983 --> 34:38.285
Officer Montero.

34:38.285 --> 34:39.421
Right?

34:39.421 --> 34:41.492
Yeah.
Now, you had the,

34:41.492 --> 34:45.801
um, public speaking thing,
right?

34:49.609 --> 34:52.480
So, look,
we're gonna walk out of here.

34:52.480 --> 34:53.817
She's not going anywhere.

34:56.422 --> 34:57.858
Just lower your gun.

34:59.996 --> 35:01.633
I'm prepared to die for her.

35:04.839 --> 35:05.874
Are you?

35:07.678 --> 35:10.249
'Cause this house is filling up
with propane right now.

35:10.249 --> 35:12.253
One shot,

35:12.253 --> 35:13.590
we light up the canyon.

35:18.299 --> 35:20.504
It's Jason, right?

35:20.504 --> 35:23.409
You came to see me your
first month on the job

35:23.409 --> 35:25.948
right after your wife left.

35:27.016 --> 35:29.421
You saved my life back then.

35:29.421 --> 35:30.891
(gas hissing)

35:33.663 --> 35:36.870
CAHILL:
You don't have
to do this, Jason.

35:36.870 --> 35:40.009
You can walk out of here.
You have a choice.

35:40.009 --> 35:41.946
You told me to keep showing up,

35:41.946 --> 35:43.048
to do the job,
that it would get better,

35:43.048 --> 35:46.021
and that no matter what
you would be there for me!

35:46.021 --> 35:48.560
Oh, you‐you probably
misinterpreted that.

35:48.560 --> 35:50.631
You know, um...

35:50.631 --> 35:52.568
You're not good enough for her.
She deserves better.

35:52.568 --> 35:53.770
Obviously.
That goes without saying.

35:53.770 --> 35:55.039
But that's neither
here nor there.

35:55.039 --> 35:55.974
What we need to focus on

35:55.974 --> 35:58.780
is getting that weapon
into that holster.

35:58.780 --> 36:00.751
Or we're gonna
have a problem.

36:00.751 --> 36:02.353
We're gonna have a problem.

36:03.289 --> 36:03.857
Riggs.

36:12.307 --> 36:13.643
(grunts)

36:39.394 --> 36:40.697
I changed my mind.

36:40.697 --> 36:42.500
Brad can keep the house.

36:42.500 --> 36:43.803
Yeah.

36:46.509 --> 36:49.682
So, he planted DNA with
Levinson's chewing gum?

36:49.682 --> 36:50.951
He knew we were
getting close,

36:50.951 --> 36:52.120
so he had to find
someone to frame.

36:52.120 --> 36:54.959
And then he wanted out like
he was Cahill's savior.

36:54.959 --> 36:56.529
Dude had a real
hero complex.

36:56.529 --> 36:58.566
Well, we all know
who the real hero is.

36:58.566 --> 36:59.869
Oh, me?
Mm, right here.

36:59.869 --> 37:01.606
You?
Did you talk to Cahill?

37:01.606 --> 37:02.541
About what?

37:02.541 --> 37:03.777
She didn't say.
No.

37:03.777 --> 37:05.012
How's she doing?
Hard to tell.

37:05.012 --> 37:07.383
You know Cahill. I told her
to take some time off, but...

37:07.383 --> 37:09.588
Too many crazies to fix?

37:09.588 --> 37:11.491
Now, I just wanted
to point out a first

37:11.491 --> 37:12.828
in your partnership.

37:12.828 --> 37:16.636
You didn't take the shot...

37:16.636 --> 37:17.838
but he did.

37:17.838 --> 37:19.407
Yes, he did.

37:19.407 --> 37:20.544
Yes, he did.

37:20.544 --> 37:21.579
That shrink paid for itself.

37:21.579 --> 37:22.815
Who do you think told him to go?

37:22.815 --> 37:26.121
Was one hell of a shot, Rog.
No hesitation.

37:26.121 --> 37:26.923
Nope.

37:26.923 --> 37:28.793
Shot him right
through the hand.

37:28.793 --> 37:30.897
Sure did.

37:32.735 --> 37:34.437
Were you aiming
for his hand, Rog?

37:35.507 --> 37:37.010
Shot him right through the hand.

37:45.660 --> 37:46.863
Need a hand?

37:48.533 --> 37:50.002
Nice try.

37:50.002 --> 37:51.471
Just because you saved my life

37:51.471 --> 37:53.777
does not entitle you
to read my files.

37:55.446 --> 37:57.050
You guys and your rules.

37:57.050 --> 37:59.120
(groans)

38:01.659 --> 38:02.728
So, what's up?

38:02.728 --> 38:05.332
Speaking of rules...

38:06.969 --> 38:08.840
...I have to refer you
to a different therapist.

38:13.048 --> 38:15.821
It's protocol after something
like this.

38:17.858 --> 38:19.094
No explanation needed.

38:21.866 --> 38:24.003
You know how grateful
I am to you?

38:25.874 --> 38:28.580
What you did...

38:28.580 --> 38:33.155
there is no way that
I could put that into words...

38:33.155 --> 38:36.027
...which that's
exactly the problem.

38:36.027 --> 38:38.633
Unresolved sexual tension.

38:38.633 --> 38:41.037
Murtaugh's dealing with
similar issues, so...

38:41.037 --> 38:42.541
No.

38:42.541 --> 38:46.214
But the dynamic
of our relationship, it...

38:46.214 --> 38:50.022
You know, the issues that we're
dealing with, the impulsivity,

38:50.022 --> 38:51.526
the lack of judgment,
these are all the reasons

38:51.526 --> 38:52.928
I'm alive today.

38:52.928 --> 38:56.936
I don't know how much
I can help you, Riggs.

38:56.936 --> 39:00.710
But you still need help.

39:00.710 --> 39:02.781

You gave her 20, honey.
Felt like 50.

41:10.068 --> 41:11.672
Riggs.
What? It's your fault.

41:11.672 --> 41:13.341
All right? You want to send me
to this new shrink.

41:13.341 --> 41:14.511
I go in there, 20 minutes later,
