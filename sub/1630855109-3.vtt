WEBVTT

00:25.942 --> 00:26.985
Yeah!

00:47.797 --> 00:50.133
Mmm.

00:50.133 --> 00:52.302
Mmm. Mmm. Lys, you've gotta--

00:52.302 --> 00:55.472
You've gotta try these muffins. Huh?

00:56.890 --> 00:58.558
Look at that bifflefly.

00:58.558 --> 01:00.018
Just sitting there.

01:00.602 --> 01:03.354
I've heard about them,
but never seen one before.

01:03.354 --> 01:05.607
Yeah, it's really neat.

01:05.607 --> 01:06.941
But you should eat.

01:06.941 --> 01:09.903
You'll need all the energy you can get
for our class trip

01:09.903 --> 01:12.280
to the Kublop Geyser this afternoon.

01:14.157 --> 01:15.158
Hello.

01:16.201 --> 01:17.327
Lys?

01:17.327 --> 01:20.246
Try me, Lys. I'm so tasty.

01:20.246 --> 01:23.708
Okay, okay. I will.

01:23.708 --> 01:26.586
Mmm. You weren't joking!

01:26.586 --> 01:29.589
Right? Nubs is gonna love these.

01:29.589 --> 01:30.799
Um, where is he?

01:30.799 --> 01:34.928
He never misses breakfast,
or lunch, or dinner.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.346
Or snack time.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.431
Let's check on him. Come on!

01:39.390 --> 01:40.850
Bye, bifflefly!

01:43.228 --> 01:44.270
- Nubs!
- Nubs?

01:44.270 --> 01:45.355
You in here?

01:49.692 --> 01:50.652
Nubs!
- Nubs!

01:52.987 --> 01:54.948
Oh, no! Are you sick?

01:56.991 --> 02:01.037
If you're sick, you can't go
on the trip to the Kublop Geyser.

02:01.037 --> 02:02.997
This is the only chance to see it.

02:02.997 --> 02:07.877
It shoots water really high into the air,
and it erupts just once a year.

02:12.006 --> 02:13.967
We don't wanna go without you.

02:13.967 --> 02:16.302
There's got to be something we can do.

02:24.060 --> 02:25.645
The Yara plant.

02:25.645 --> 02:28.648
Says here that a tea made from its leaves

02:28.648 --> 02:32.235
can make anyone with the sniffles
feel better within minutes.

02:32.235 --> 02:35.989
So if we find that plant
and have Nubs drink the tea,

02:35.989 --> 02:38.241
he'll feel better
and won't miss the geyser.

02:40.410 --> 02:45.373
Says here the Yara plant only grows
on top of one giant Tenoo tree,

02:45.373 --> 02:47.458
and it's pretty far away.

02:47.458 --> 02:50.670
We'd have to go fast to make it back
in time for the class trip.

02:50.670 --> 02:52.839
It's always the three of us on missions.

02:54.632 --> 02:56.092
We'll make a great team.

02:56.092 --> 02:59.345
Besides,
we're going on a mission for Nubs.

03:02.348 --> 03:04.017
Hmm.

03:04.017 --> 03:06.603
It's quite a trip
to that giant Tenoo tree,

03:06.603 --> 03:08.938
and it looks like a tough climb
to the top.

03:08.938 --> 03:10.190
We have to go.

03:10.190 --> 03:13.193
Nubs has been looking forward
to seeing the geyser forever.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.028
It would just be the two of you.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.654
You sure you can handle this?

03:16.654 --> 03:17.864
Of course we can.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.908
We've trained for
these kind of adventures.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.534
Please!

03:22.243 --> 03:23.328
All right.

03:23.328 --> 03:24.495
Yes!

03:24.495 --> 03:26.664
Also, I know it's just the two of you.

03:26.664 --> 03:30.919
So, Lys, remember to stay focused
and present while on your mission.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.128
And, Kai, remember,

03:32.128 --> 03:35.882
sometimes it helps to slow down
and pay attention to your surroundings.

03:35.882 --> 03:37.258
Yes, Master Zia.

03:37.258 --> 03:38.593
You two are a team,

03:38.593 --> 03:41.888
so watch out for each other
and listen to each other.

03:42.430 --> 03:45.892
If you want,
you can take the temple speeders.

03:45.892 --> 03:48.228
The speeders?

03:48.228 --> 03:49.687
Good luck, younglings!

03:49.687 --> 03:51.272
May the Force be with yo--

03:51.272 --> 03:52.482
And you're gone.

03:58.196 --> 04:01.491
Wow!
Landspeeders go on land and water!

04:01.491 --> 04:03.826
This is amazing!

04:03.826 --> 04:08.665
Remember, if we're gonna get back in time,
we gotta stay focused and move fast!

04:09.374 --> 04:10.917
Fast, you say?

04:10.917 --> 04:12.043
Race ya!

04:21.135 --> 04:22.887
Flitterpods?

04:23.721 --> 04:26.057
I didn't know they lived around here.

04:26.057 --> 04:28.101
- Hi there, little one.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.228
Lys! Watch out!
- Huh?

04:33.231 --> 04:35.233
Whew. Thanks, Kai.

04:35.233 --> 04:37.068
That was close.

04:37.068 --> 04:39.529
I got distracted by the flitterpods.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.823
Better stay focused on the mission.

04:52.250 --> 04:55.545
It doesn't say which way to go
to the giant Tenoo tree.

04:56.170 --> 04:57.839
This is the same way we've been going.

04:57.839 --> 05:01.009
- So it's probably this way.
Wait!

05:01.009 --> 05:04.804
Sometimes when I don't know what to do,
I stop and look around.

05:07.223 --> 05:08.933
Stop and look around?

05:08.933 --> 05:10.059
We need to keep moving.

05:10.059 --> 05:13.271
Besides, all I see is water, mud, and--

05:13.271 --> 05:17.483
Leaves! Tenoo tree leaves. Giant ones.

05:17.483 --> 05:22.655
If we're going to a giant Tenoo tree,
and these are giant leaves...

05:22.655 --> 05:26.409
The giant Tenoo tree must be that way.

05:26.409 --> 05:27.910
Exactly.

05:27.910 --> 05:31.456
Wow. I would've missed that
and gone the wrong way.

05:31.456 --> 05:32.665
Glad I listened to you.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.959
That's why we're a good team.

05:34.959 --> 05:36.294
What are you waiting for?

05:36.294 --> 05:39.088
Like you said, we need to keep moving.

05:46.888 --> 05:47.889
Whoa.

05:47.889 --> 05:50.224
I knew the giant Tenoo tree
was gonna be big,

05:50.224 --> 05:53.936
but this is really, really, really big.

05:56.481 --> 05:59.233
You really think we can climb it?

05:59.233 --> 06:01.861
We've trained for this kind of thing.
We're a team.

06:01.861 --> 06:05.823
If we listen to each other,
and help each other, I know we can.

06:05.823 --> 06:07.450
You're right.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.036
This way!

06:14.624 --> 06:15.625
- Kai!

06:15.625 --> 06:17.543
Whoa!

06:17.543 --> 06:18.920
Whew.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.297
Take it slow.

06:21.297 --> 06:23.007
- Come on.

06:23.007 --> 06:25.676
Ready, set, throw!

06:32.725 --> 06:33.726
Careful, Kai.

06:36.354 --> 06:38.439
- Got ya!

06:40.691 --> 06:42.735
I know. Take it slow.

06:47.323 --> 06:48.699
Come on.

06:52.203 --> 06:54.414
Whoa! Check it out, Kai.

06:55.498 --> 06:57.875
- Look, it's smiling.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.718
Are we there yet?

07:07.718 --> 07:10.054
- Kai!

07:10.054 --> 07:11.389
Whoa! Thanks, Lys.

07:11.389 --> 07:12.473
Anytime.

07:13.182 --> 07:14.183
Hmm.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.436
Aha!

07:24.485 --> 07:25.987
- Whoo-hoo!

07:29.115 --> 07:30.700
Almost there.

07:33.911 --> 07:34.996
- We did it.

07:34.996 --> 07:36.497
We made it to the top.

07:36.497 --> 07:37.957
It's beautiful.

07:38.624 --> 07:40.960
Whoa. Look at it.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.212
It's like a whole other world up here.

07:43.212 --> 07:45.506
Now we need to find Yara leaves.

07:45.506 --> 07:47.592
The holobook said
they grow near the water.

07:48.509 --> 07:49.719
Let's check by the lake.

07:51.596 --> 07:56.434
All right, Yara plant,
I know you're around here somewhere.

07:56.434 --> 07:58.269
Uh, Kai?
- What?

07:58.269 --> 07:59.645
Paw prints.

07:59.645 --> 08:02.356
They look like they were made by a gangul.

08:02.356 --> 08:03.941
- A what?
- A gangul.

08:03.941 --> 08:05.026
I've heard about them.

08:05.026 --> 08:08.196
They're big and don't like anyone
around their homes.

08:08.196 --> 08:10.573
We should be careful and be quiet.

08:10.573 --> 08:13.284
I don't see any creatures around.

08:15.578 --> 08:18.289
But I do see a Yara plant!

08:21.250 --> 08:23.544
Kai, we have to be quiet or--

08:28.466 --> 08:31.552
- Uh, is that a gangul?

08:31.552 --> 08:33.346
That is a gangul.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.974
Whoa. It's more amazing
than I thought it would be.

08:36.974 --> 08:38.935
Yeah. [chuckles] Amazing.

08:38.935 --> 08:41.812
Um... [chuckles] ...n-nice gangul.

08:41.812 --> 08:44.524
- Not nice gangul!

08:44.524 --> 08:48.110
- Look at it run. So majestic.

08:48.110 --> 08:50.613
Lys! The Yara leaves!

08:50.613 --> 08:53.741
You can grab them while the gangul
is busy chasing me!

08:56.077 --> 08:56.994
There!

09:06.295 --> 09:07.630
- Run, Lys!

09:07.630 --> 09:09.757
Didn't know ganguls were so fast.

09:09.757 --> 09:11.884
I love learning new things
about creatures,

09:11.884 --> 09:13.719
just not while I'm running from them!

09:19.559 --> 09:21.227
We're trapped!

09:23.145 --> 09:25.815
And there's an angry gangul
guarding the Yara leaves.

09:25.815 --> 09:28.359
We'll never get that tea to Nubs in time.

09:30.194 --> 09:33.489
I should've listened to you
and been more careful.

09:33.489 --> 09:36.033
And I should've stayed focused
on our mission

09:36.033 --> 09:38.744
and grabbed the Yara leaves
when I had the chance.

09:38.744 --> 09:41.289
Some team we are, right?

09:45.376 --> 09:47.086
We are some team.

09:47.086 --> 09:50.298
We may be different,
but that's why we're good together.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.301
Kai, look how far we've come.

09:53.301 --> 09:57.305
Sure, we may be stuck
with a big angry creature outside...

09:59.974 --> 10:03.311
...but we make a great team
when we listen to each other.

10:03.311 --> 10:06.897
I would've crashed my speeder if you
hadn't been there to look out for me.

10:06.897 --> 10:09.775
And I would've gone down the wrong river
if it weren't for you.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.986
Which gives me an idea.

10:14.614 --> 10:16.824
Wha-- What are you doing?

10:16.824 --> 10:17.950
I'm listening to you.

10:17.950 --> 10:20.202
You said when you don't know what to do,

10:20.202 --> 10:23.456
sometimes it helps
to stop and look around.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.708
So, that's what I'm doing.

10:31.088 --> 10:33.424
I've got an idea.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.892
It thinks there's something
in the bushes.

10:42.892 --> 10:45.436
Okay, Lys,
you can get the Yara leaves now.

10:56.989 --> 10:57.990
Got 'em!

10:58.574 --> 11:00.451
- Go, team!

11:04.872 --> 11:05.956
Uh-oh.

11:07.375 --> 11:08.959
Stay away from my friend.

11:09.585 --> 11:11.128
Yeah!

11:11.754 --> 11:14.131
We're not gonna hurt you,
but we need these leaves.

11:14.131 --> 11:16.384
You're not gonna stop us.

11:16.384 --> 11:18.511
- Go on. Get out of here.

11:19.970 --> 11:21.889
- We did it!
- We did!

11:21.889 --> 11:24.016
Let's get back to Nubs, fast.

11:26.477 --> 11:29.730
I'm glad the tea is working
and you're feeling better, Nubs.

11:31.023 --> 11:34.694
And I'm glad we can all watch
the Kublop Geyser together.

11:35.986 --> 11:39.740
We missed you,
but Lys and I had quite an adventure.

11:40.491 --> 11:41.492
We make a good team.

11:41.492 --> 11:42.785
We sure do.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.163
Students, pay attention.

11:46.163 --> 11:48.541
- The geyser should be erupting...

11:48.541 --> 11:49.625
...now.

11:51.836 --> 11:53.838
Whoa!

11:55.214 --> 11:57.508
- Wow.

12:09.645 --> 12:14.108
And here's a Fizzroot Shake for Nash,
two Alphaberry Sap-Shakes for Kai and Lys,

12:14.108 --> 12:17.194
- and the daily special for Nubs.
- Ah!

12:17.194 --> 12:18.946
My own original recipe.

12:27.663 --> 12:29.457
Thanks, Hap.

12:29.999 --> 12:31.625
These are amazing!

12:31.625 --> 12:34.336
Ah, glad you liked it.

12:34.336 --> 12:38.507
Remember, it's always happening
at Hap's Sap Tap.

12:38.507 --> 12:39.800
Enjoy your drinks, kids.

12:39.800 --> 12:43.888
Oh, Nash, I've been wondering,
who's that statue of?

12:43.888 --> 12:46.056
Huh?

12:46.056 --> 12:48.184
Oh, that's a statue of Kaliah Kublop.

12:48.184 --> 12:50.227
- She's the founder of Kublop Springs.

12:50.227 --> 12:52.938
Long ago,
she traveled across the galaxy

12:52.938 --> 12:54.982
and was the first person on Tenoo.

12:54.982 --> 12:57.610
She welcomed travelers
from all over the sector.

12:57.610 --> 13:01.322
Seems like Kublop Springs
has been welcoming people ever since.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.535
Oh, dear!

13:06.535 --> 13:07.953
Hey, that's Marlaa.

13:08.579 --> 13:10.539
Come on, Marlaa.
I gotta hurry. I gotta hurry.

13:10.539 --> 13:11.749
Need this?

13:11.749 --> 13:13.459
Why, yes! That's my lunch.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.877
Thank you.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.671
Marlaa, meet my Jedi friends.

13:17.671 --> 13:19.590
Oh, hey, Nash. Hey, kids.

13:19.590 --> 13:21.592
Marlaa owns the junkyard around here.

13:23.052 --> 13:25.638
Oh, you're all so very helpful.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.057
I would love to stay and chat,
but I must be off.

13:28.057 --> 13:30.935
I gotta rush back to my junkyard
before that thief strikes again.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.603
Thief?

13:32.603 --> 13:33.729
Oh, yes.

13:33.729 --> 13:37.441
Someone has been stealing
the junk in my junkyard.

13:37.441 --> 13:39.235
I haven't caught 'em yet.

13:39.235 --> 13:40.611
Well, we can help.

13:40.611 --> 13:41.862
That's what Jedi do.

13:41.862 --> 13:44.740
You've already been pretty helpful.

13:44.740 --> 13:47.576
You kids, eh, wanna help catch a thief?

13:47.576 --> 13:49.161
Yes!

13:50.162 --> 13:52.373
Welcome to my junkyard.

13:56.877 --> 13:58.254
I love this place.

13:58.254 --> 14:01.173
My moms and I buy spare starship parts
from here all the time.

14:01.173 --> 14:04.093
Isn't this junk beautiful?

14:04.093 --> 14:05.886
It's broken junk.

14:05.886 --> 14:07.972
You think it's beautiful?

14:07.972 --> 14:09.515
Of course!

14:09.515 --> 14:12.017
Every piece of broken junk is special.

14:12.017 --> 14:14.228
You never know how it can be reused.

14:14.228 --> 14:18.941
They can be turned into all kinds
of amazing new things, like artwork.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.025
See?

14:20.025 --> 14:21.193
Whoa.

14:21.193 --> 14:25.030
I made all of 'em out of glorious junk.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.575
Wow. You're good, Marlaa.

14:28.659 --> 14:30.411
Is that your home too?

14:30.411 --> 14:32.204
It sure is.

14:32.204 --> 14:33.831
I love living here.

14:33.831 --> 14:36.834
That's why I'm upset
someone's stealing from me.

14:36.834 --> 14:38.460
If they take more junk,

14:38.460 --> 14:41.255
I won't have the right pieces
to sell to customers,

14:41.255 --> 14:45.092
and then I may have to close up shop
and leave.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.677
That's not gonna happen,

14:46.677 --> 14:50.014
because we're gonna catch that thief
and get your stuff back.

14:50.014 --> 14:52.224
Oh, bless you, darlings.

14:52.224 --> 14:55.644
Marlaa, can you tell us anything
about this junk-stealing thief?

14:55.644 --> 14:58.939
At first, only small junk pieces
were disappearing.

14:58.939 --> 15:04.945
But today, I noticed the thief stole
the gears from my servo-lifter.

15:04.945 --> 15:07.573
It helps me move heavy pieces of junk.

15:07.573 --> 15:10.284
But now it's not working,
thanks to the thief.

15:10.284 --> 15:13.287
We need to find out where the thief went.

15:13.871 --> 15:14.872
Hmm.

15:18.083 --> 15:21.003
- Hmm.
- Maybe we should look for--

15:21.003 --> 15:22.546
A clue. Look!

15:24.632 --> 15:25.883
Yes! A clue.

15:26.425 --> 15:27.426
Thanks, Lys.

15:27.426 --> 15:31.138
I bet the thief dripped oil
when they stole part of the servo-lifter.

15:31.138 --> 15:32.514
Let's follow this trail.

15:32.514 --> 15:34.350
Maybe we'll find out where they went.

15:34.350 --> 15:37.895
I'd better stay here
just in case the thief comes back.

15:37.895 --> 15:41.482
Plus, I need to move some
of this heavy junk into piles.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.776
Except I don't have a servo-lifter.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.112
- Whoa!

15:47.112 --> 15:49.657
Oh, I like this one.

15:49.657 --> 15:52.785
- You're staying with me, Mr. Fuzzy-Face.

15:52.785 --> 15:54.244
Okay.

15:54.244 --> 15:56.830
I guess Nubs is staying here
to help Marlaa.

15:56.830 --> 15:58.999
- We'll be back soon.

15:59.541 --> 16:01.585
Yes, move that over there.

16:02.419 --> 16:03.921
- Little to the left.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.798
- No, no. Wrong pile.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.633
- Be careful!

16:09.093 --> 16:11.178
Hmm, the trail stops here.

16:12.888 --> 16:15.140
- Where do we look now?

16:15.140 --> 16:17.434
RJ hears something.

16:17.434 --> 16:20.145
- Over there.

16:27.069 --> 16:29.321
It's Taborr and his pirates.

16:29.321 --> 16:31.907
And that stuff's got to be
from Marlaa's junkyard.

16:32.908 --> 16:34.451
Ha! Finished.

16:34.451 --> 16:36.245
- It's glorious.

16:36.245 --> 16:39.623
The pirates at Yarrum Tower are gonna be
so impressed when they see this.

16:40.708 --> 16:41.959
Now that it's ready,

16:41.959 --> 16:44.545
we can finally steal things
that are bigger and better.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.088
I have another idea.

16:46.088 --> 16:48.132
Let's steal things
that are bigger and better.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.092
- But that's what I--
- We should test it out.

16:50.092 --> 16:52.886
That's enough stealing
for one day, Taborr.

16:52.886 --> 16:54.722
Oh, it's you.

16:54.722 --> 16:58.434
Should've expected you pirates
would steal from Marlaa's junkyard.

16:58.434 --> 17:00.644
- It's just junk.

17:00.644 --> 17:01.854
What do you care?

17:01.854 --> 17:04.898
Because every piece of that junk
is special.

17:04.898 --> 17:07.526
It belongs to Marlaa,
and we're bringing it back to her.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.363
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

17:12.281 --> 17:14.366
- Right, Junk Giant?

17:14.366 --> 17:16.577
- Junk Giant?

17:20.330 --> 17:23.000
We built it out of junk
from that lady's junkyard.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.460
Impressive, huh?

17:24.460 --> 17:27.921
I'm gonna use it to steal
all kinds of heavy things,

17:27.921 --> 17:31.008
starting with that founder's statue
everyone loves so much.

17:31.008 --> 17:33.218
Junk Giant, don't let them follow us.

17:37.014 --> 17:39.016
- Take cover!

17:46.315 --> 17:47.524
What's it doing?

17:49.568 --> 17:51.570
We're blocked in!

17:52.821 --> 17:54.990
All right. Nice work, Junk Giant.

17:54.990 --> 17:57.701
Now, we've got a statue to steal.

18:01.038 --> 18:03.332
Too heavy.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.836
- You're okay, buddy.

18:09.213 --> 18:12.591
Lys, maybe you and I can move this
with the Force.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.233
We're not strong enough.

18:29.233 --> 18:31.819
There's got to be something
we can use to get out of here,

18:31.819 --> 18:34.530
but all I see is broken junk.

18:34.530 --> 18:36.448
- Broken junk?

18:36.448 --> 18:37.991
That's it!

18:37.991 --> 18:40.285
It's just like Marlaa said.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.704
Broken things can be turned
into something new.

18:42.704 --> 18:46.333
If Taborr built a new giant droid
out of junk,

18:46.333 --> 18:49.920
maybe we can build something new
to move that crate.

18:52.381 --> 18:53.966
We can start with this.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.142
Aha!

19:03.725 --> 19:06.061
It's lifting time.

19:13.527 --> 19:15.070
Yes!

19:15.070 --> 19:16.321
We did it.

19:16.321 --> 19:19.575
Now let's stop Taborr
and get Marlaa's junk back.

19:20.868 --> 19:23.328
What's that giant droid doing
to the statue?

19:23.328 --> 19:24.663
Look at us,

19:24.663 --> 19:27.583
stealing the famous Kaliah Kublop statue.

19:27.583 --> 19:29.501
Who wouldn't be impressed by us?

19:30.586 --> 19:31.962
All right, Taborr.

19:31.962 --> 19:34.798
Pirate party's over. Put that statue back.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.343
Why can't you Jedi ever stay put?

19:38.343 --> 19:40.345
Junk Giant, get them!

19:46.894 --> 19:49.146
There's gotta be a way to shut it down!

19:54.067 --> 19:55.319
Kai!

19:57.988 --> 19:59.406
I can't find a power switch!

20:15.589 --> 20:17.799
My Junk Giant is broken!

20:24.389 --> 20:26.892
- Uh, let's get out of here.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.518
What about the Junk Giant?

20:28.518 --> 20:30.771
Leave it. It's useless.

20:32.356 --> 20:35.943
Junk Giant, stay and keep those Jedi
from following us.

20:45.869 --> 20:48.580
- Wait! We don't have to fight.

20:53.001 --> 20:55.671
Taborr may have been ready
to throw you away...

20:57.172 --> 21:00.175
...but today I learned
that every piece of junk is special,

21:00.175 --> 21:02.302
and it can become amazing things.

21:02.302 --> 21:05.555
Like beautiful artwork, or a crane,

21:05.555 --> 21:09.685
or a giant droid
that doesn't have to fight and steal.

21:10.978 --> 21:12.312
You may be broken...

21:13.438 --> 21:15.232
...but you're still special.

21:16.316 --> 21:17.609
Absolutely!

21:29.329 --> 21:31.123
Thanks, Nubs. [stammers] Wait.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.166
This pile is for small junk parts.

21:33.166 --> 21:35.502
It really should be in the starship pile.

21:39.506 --> 21:41.508
Marlaa, we're back!

21:41.508 --> 21:44.011
And we brought back the stolen junk.

21:53.478 --> 21:56.356
Except the junk's a little different now.

21:56.356 --> 21:58.775
Taborr turned your junk
into a giant droid.

22:02.612 --> 22:05.073
- Aw. Huh.

22:08.285 --> 22:09.286
She's...

22:11.455 --> 22:13.582
beautiful.

22:16.585 --> 22:20.464
If we get that arm fixed up,
would you like to stay here

22:20.464 --> 22:23.633
and help me by lifting heavy things
around the junkyard?

22:23.633 --> 22:26.178
I know we'd have a blast together.

22:28.972 --> 22:30.057
That's great.

22:30.057 --> 22:33.143
Except, what am I gonna call you?

22:33.143 --> 22:34.311
You need a name, dear.

22:34.311 --> 22:38.899
Hmm. You're a Junk Giant
and you're one of a kind.

22:39.441 --> 22:42.694
How about JG-1?

22:45.614 --> 22:48.450
- Welcome home, JG-1.

22:48.450 --> 22:51.286
Thank you, kids. For everything.

22:58.710 --> 23:00.837
You were right, Marlaa.

23:00.837 --> 23:03.465
Broken junk isn't really broken at all.

23:03.465 --> 23:05.967
It's just waiting to become something new...

23:07.386 --> 23:08.553
and amazing.
