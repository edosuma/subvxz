00:01.166 --> 00:03.333
Welcome to "Superhuman"!

00:03.333 --> 00:06.734
You will witness five
of the most incredible people

00:06.734 --> 00:08.767
you will ever see.

00:08.767 --> 00:11.667
Your job is to say
the words forward.

00:11.667 --> 00:12.767
- Tnahpele. 
- Elephant.

00:12.767 --> 00:14.400
- Noisivelet. 
- Television.

00:14.400 --> 00:16.533
That was incredible.

00:16.533 --> 00:19.667
Sticker price is $355 a month,
$900 for warranty.

00:19.667 --> 00:20.967
Taxes $615.

00:20.967 --> 00:22.367
What is the price?

00:22.367 --> 00:24.567
$21,176.

00:24.567 --> 00:27.734
- Are you sure?
- I think that's it.

00:27.734 --> 00:29.533
Our panelists
will make changes,

00:29.533 --> 00:33.333
inspect the barrack,
and find those differences.

00:33.333 --> 00:35.767
What you did was one of the most
amazing things I have seen.

00:35.767 --> 00:38.934
( cheers and applause )

00:38.934 --> 00:42.166
The winner of the $50,000

00:42.166 --> 00:44.900
and the title
of "Superhuman" is...

00:44.900 --> 00:46.667
We got it! That's insane!

00:46.667 --> 00:50.500
- Congratulations!
- Wow!

00:50.500 --> 00:52.533
Oh, Lord!

00:52.533 --> 00:55.467
( cheers and applause )

00:57.667 --> 00:59.767
( theme music playing )

00:59.767 --> 01:01.633
Thank you.

01:03.400 --> 01:04.834
We love you, Kal!

01:04.834 --> 01:06.467
Thanks, Mike.

01:11.500 --> 01:15.533
Welcome to "Superhuman"!

01:15.533 --> 01:17.400
I'm Kal Penn.

01:17.400 --> 01:20.333
Tonight,
five extraordinary people

01:20.333 --> 01:22.400
will showcase
their jaw-dropping,

01:22.400 --> 01:24.400
amazing acts of wonder,

01:24.400 --> 01:28.700
all competing to win $50,000

01:28.700 --> 01:32.900
and the title of "Superhuman."

01:32.900 --> 01:35.633
But who on Earth
can possibly determine

01:35.633 --> 01:38.200
which contestant
is the most superhuman?

01:38.200 --> 01:41.433
That task is given in part
to our panel.

01:41.433 --> 01:45.000
First, several opponents
of this heavyweight champ

01:45.000 --> 01:47.934
woke up on the floor wondering
what the heck just happened.

01:47.934 --> 01:51.100
What happened is they helped
create the boxing legend

01:51.100 --> 01:53.367
that is Mike Tyson!

01:59.266 --> 02:02.367
Next, she makes movies,
she makes records,

02:02.367 --> 02:04.400
she makes business deals,

02:04.400 --> 02:06.433
and she makes the center chair
look good.

02:06.433 --> 02:10.967
It's Christina Milian.

02:10.967 --> 02:14.734
Finally, it's brain surgeon
and neuroscientist

02:14.734 --> 02:19.066
Dr. Rahul Jandial.

02:19.066 --> 02:22.033
Our panelists
have a very important job.

02:22.033 --> 02:25.166
They will be picking tonight's
top three contestants,

02:25.166 --> 02:26.700
and after
those three are chosen,

02:26.700 --> 02:29.500
we pass the voting baton
over to the audience.

02:29.500 --> 02:33.166
They will ultimately choose
who wins $50,000

02:33.166 --> 02:35.967
and the title "Superhuman."

02:35.967 --> 02:38.734
Let's get started.

02:38.734 --> 02:41.633
This Army mom
was one of the first women

02:41.633 --> 02:44.200
to work in
the Patriot missile program.

02:44.200 --> 02:47.433
Tonight, she launches her
superhuman photographic memory

02:47.433 --> 02:49.433
at $50,000.

02:49.433 --> 02:51.867
She is Andrea Carlton.

02:54.467 --> 02:56.500
My name is Andrea Carlton.

02:56.500 --> 02:59.633
My superhuman ability
is photographic memory.

02:59.633 --> 03:01.266
I never miss a detail.

03:01.266 --> 03:05.033
I look at something, I memorize
every single detail about it,

03:05.033 --> 03:08.400
and when it comes time
for me to recall that,

03:08.400 --> 03:09.567
it's almost like
a file cabinet.

03:09.567 --> 03:12.166
I pull it out and I re-see it

03:12.166 --> 03:14.600
as it is even if it's not
right in front of me.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.066
When I was in the Army,

03:16.066 --> 03:19.166
I discovered my ability
is superhuman.

03:19.166 --> 03:21.734
Everything has its place.

03:21.734 --> 03:24.467
And if something
was out of place, I knew it.

03:24.467 --> 03:26.333
I never would have thought

03:26.333 --> 03:28.900
that I'd be competing
with my ability,

03:28.900 --> 03:32.033
but I'm super excited
about it.

03:32.033 --> 03:34.166
( cheers and applause )

03:34.166 --> 03:36.066
From Los Angeles, California,

03:36.066 --> 03:38.734
please welcome
Andrea Carlton!

03:42.367 --> 03:44.333
- Hi, Andrea.
- Hi!

03:44.333 --> 03:46.433
- Welcome to "Superhuman."
- Thank you.

03:46.433 --> 03:48.100
Okay, first things first,

03:48.100 --> 03:50.066
you served 12 years
in the Army.

03:50.066 --> 03:51.500
Thank you
for your service.

03:51.500 --> 03:54.300
Thank you. Yes, I did.

03:54.300 --> 03:55.600
Thank you.

03:55.600 --> 03:59.200
All right, Andrea, your
challenge is called "Debunked."

03:59.200 --> 04:00.700
On the stage behind us,

04:00.700 --> 04:02.200
we've created what we hope

04:02.200 --> 04:04.600
is an authentic-looking
army barrack

04:04.600 --> 04:06.633
that is filled with
more than a thousand items.

04:06.633 --> 04:08.834
In this challenge,
you'll have to call

04:08.834 --> 04:10.767
on your powers
of photographic memory

04:10.767 --> 04:12.000
to investigate the barrack.

04:12.000 --> 04:13.166
You'll walk inside it

04:13.166 --> 04:15.300
and take a series
of mental pictures.

04:15.300 --> 04:16.632
Commit everything
to memory, okay?

04:16.632 --> 04:17.666
Okay.

04:17.666 --> 04:19.266
When you're done studying,

04:19.266 --> 04:20.834
our panelists
will then come up

04:20.834 --> 04:23.567
and make three
subtle changes in there.

04:23.567 --> 04:25.600
Andrea, after
our panelists are done,

04:25.600 --> 04:27.333
you'll have to inspect
the barrack once again

04:27.333 --> 04:29.633
and find those
three differences.

04:29.633 --> 04:32.233
Andrea, you may now
enter the barrack.

04:32.233 --> 04:35.200
Your challenge starts now.

05:16.967 --> 05:18.433
Okay.

05:18.433 --> 05:22.333
( applause )

05:22.333 --> 05:25.967
Whoo-hoo-hoo.

05:25.967 --> 05:28.300
Each of our panelists
will now make one change

05:28.300 --> 05:29.367
in the barrack.

05:29.367 --> 05:30.734
Mike, you're up first.

05:30.734 --> 05:32.834
( grunts )

05:38.600 --> 05:41.967
( laughter )

05:41.967 --> 05:44.700
( applause )

05:46.300 --> 05:48.367
Okay, Mike
has made his change.

05:48.367 --> 05:51.033
Christina,
now it's your turn.

05:51.033 --> 05:52.433
All right.

06:09.867 --> 06:12.934
( applause )

06:12.934 --> 06:15.767
Okay, two changes down.
One to go.

06:15.767 --> 06:16.667
Dr. Jandial.

06:39.166 --> 06:43.633
( applause )

06:43.633 --> 06:45.333
All right, Andrea.

06:45.333 --> 06:47.667
Three changes have been made
in the barracks.

06:47.667 --> 06:49.433
It's now time for you
to tell us

06:49.433 --> 06:51.500
what those
three changes are.

06:51.500 --> 06:52.500
- Yeah.
- All right.

06:52.500 --> 06:55.166
All yours. Thank you.

07:41.200 --> 07:42.200
Okay.

07:42.200 --> 07:46.433
The first difference
is the sunglasses

07:46.433 --> 07:47.633
were on the boots.

07:47.633 --> 07:50.567
The sunglasses were on
the boots, she's saying.

07:50.567 --> 07:53.600
If one of our panelists
made that change, Andrea,

07:53.600 --> 07:55.033
you are correct.

07:55.033 --> 07:58.133
So let's ask the panel.
Did anyone make that change?

08:05.000 --> 08:06.734
Maybe I did.

08:06.734 --> 08:08.467
( cheers and applause )

08:08.467 --> 08:09.734
Nice job.

08:09.734 --> 08:11.433
Andrea, show me
another difference

08:11.433 --> 08:13.433
you think you found.

08:13.433 --> 08:15.467
Andrea: Okay,
change number two is...

08:18.333 --> 08:21.033
There were four towels
up here.

08:21.033 --> 08:22.667
But where's it at?

08:22.667 --> 08:25.800
- ( laughter )
- Are you sitting on it?

08:25.800 --> 08:28.367
Yes, I did get rid
of a towel.

08:28.367 --> 08:31.834
Nicely done. Okay.

08:31.834 --> 08:34.066
Ah.

08:34.066 --> 08:36.700
Andrea, you found
two out of two changes.

08:36.700 --> 08:38.232
You found the sunglasses.

08:38.232 --> 08:39.967
You noticed there were
four towels there.

08:39.967 --> 08:41.799
Now there are only three.

08:41.799 --> 08:44.467
Can you now show me
the final change that was made?

08:44.467 --> 08:45.900
- Yes.
- All right.

08:50.367 --> 08:53.667
The final change is...

08:56.567 --> 08:59.133
Dr. Jandial, is this
a change that you made?

08:59.133 --> 09:01.233
That's absolutely
a change I made.

09:01.233 --> 09:03.533
Oh, my God!

09:03.533 --> 09:05.633
Whoo! Yeah!

09:05.633 --> 09:07.033
Whoa!

09:07.033 --> 09:08.967
- I-- you got it.
- Yes!

09:08.967 --> 09:13.367
That's crazy.

09:13.367 --> 09:14.600
When you were
going through it,

09:14.600 --> 09:16.533
you were scanning something
with your hand.

09:16.533 --> 09:18.700
What was that about?
What's your process
when you do this?

09:18.700 --> 09:20.567
When I--
when I use my hand,

09:20.567 --> 09:22.767
it helps me
place everything,

09:22.767 --> 09:24.100
so when I put my hand up,

09:24.100 --> 09:26.233
if something's
not in that place,

09:26.233 --> 09:27.367
I can see it.

09:27.367 --> 09:29.433
- Wow.
- I notice.

09:29.433 --> 09:31.000
It's a placement thing.

09:31.000 --> 09:32.400
Wow. And...

09:32.400 --> 09:33.734
Milian:
 I was curious if you, like,

09:33.734 --> 09:35.967
felt, like, the vibrations,
or, like, the sense...

09:35.967 --> 09:37.467
I thought it was-- yes.

09:37.467 --> 09:39.300
I saw a definitely
God concept--

09:39.300 --> 09:42.166
'cause my mother
was in church--
"Jesus' love!

09:42.166 --> 09:44.433
Please, you know.
Oh, Lord!"

09:44.433 --> 09:46.834
That's so good.

09:46.834 --> 09:48.300
Dr. Jandial,
can you explain to us

09:48.300 --> 09:50.233
the difference between
photographic memory

09:50.233 --> 09:51.500
and other types of memory?

09:51.500 --> 09:53.533
Let's think about
our vision as a camera.

09:53.533 --> 09:55.033
So our eyes
are like the lens.

09:55.033 --> 09:57.467
You can put glasses on,
you can take the lens off.

09:57.467 --> 09:59.867
Our brain is actually
the camera.

09:59.867 --> 10:02.266
And what people with
photographic memory have is,

10:02.266 --> 10:03.533
they're not better
at seeing.

10:03.533 --> 10:05.166
They're better holding on
to what they see.

10:05.166 --> 10:07.066
But what you did here

10:07.066 --> 10:08.600
was one of the most amazing
things I have seen.

10:08.600 --> 10:09.633
That was awesome.

10:09.633 --> 10:11.100
Thank you.

10:11.100 --> 10:14.867
Andrea, thank you
for that amazing showcase
of your ability

10:14.867 --> 10:16.467
and for serving
our country.

10:16.467 --> 10:18.433
- Thank you.
- Andrea Carlton, everyone.

10:18.433 --> 10:19.734
Thank you.

10:19.734 --> 10:21.934
Really nicely done.
We'll see you later in the show.

10:21.934 --> 10:23.700
Thank you.

10:27.467 --> 10:29.033
It's a yellow warbler.

10:29.033 --> 10:32.300
( vocalizing )
Whoo-whoo, whoo-whoo!

10:33.400 --> 10:35.800
Your job is to say
the word forward

10:35.800 --> 10:37.300
in 60 seconds.

10:37.300 --> 10:38.800
- Noisivelet. 
- Television.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.033
Rotaregirfer.

10:41.033 --> 10:42.633
Jandial:
 Language is a one-way street.

10:42.633 --> 10:44.266
You're really not supposed
to conceptualize it

10:44.266 --> 10:46.200
going backwards.

10:53.767 --> 10:56.300
Welcome back to "Superhuman"!

10:56.300 --> 11:00.367
This birdwatcher
was played by Jack Black

11:00.367 --> 11:02.066
in a major Hollywood film,

11:02.066 --> 11:04.200
proving that no one
in the world

11:04.200 --> 11:06.567
is more sure
that "bird is the word"

11:06.567 --> 11:08.400
than Greg Miller.

11:08.400 --> 11:10.300
( cheers and applause )

11:13.400 --> 11:15.400
My name is Greg Miller,

11:15.400 --> 11:17.600
and my superhuman ability

11:17.600 --> 11:21.533
is to be able to identify
tons of birds.

11:21.533 --> 11:23.367
Most people spend all their time
with their eyes,

11:23.367 --> 11:24.700
but many birds
can be overlooked

11:24.700 --> 11:26.767
if you don't spend time
hearing as well.

11:26.767 --> 11:29.800
My life is represented
in the movie "The Big Year."

11:29.800 --> 11:31.734
And Jack Black portrays me

11:31.734 --> 11:33.800
as the real-life birder
in that movie.

11:33.800 --> 11:35.667
It was an amazing experience.

11:35.667 --> 11:37.800
Ah, birding is very cool.

11:37.800 --> 11:40.133
I used to think
it was just a hobby.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.767
It's actually deeper than that.

11:41.767 --> 11:44.467
It's my world.

11:44.467 --> 11:45.734
From Sugarcreek, Ohio,

11:45.734 --> 11:47.567
please welcome Greg Miller!

11:52.200 --> 11:54.100
- Hello, Greg.
- Hey, Kal.

11:54.100 --> 11:56.100
- How are you?
- I'm doing fine, thank you.

11:56.100 --> 11:57.800
- Welcome to "Superhuman."
- Thank you.

11:57.800 --> 12:00.533
You have an interesting
superhuman ability.

12:00.533 --> 12:02.400
What prompted you
to love birds so much?

12:02.400 --> 12:04.000
Uh, it was my dad.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.967
My dad got me started
before I could remember.

12:06.967 --> 12:08.567
I got a pair of binoculars,

12:08.567 --> 12:10.000
and I don't ever
remember getting them.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.600
Okay.

12:11.600 --> 12:13.500
I went birding,
and don't remember
the first time I went.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.734
So it's just--
I loved birding

12:15.734 --> 12:17.533
since before
I can remember.

12:17.533 --> 12:19.734
Wow, wait, so you've always
had a pair of binoculars.

12:19.734 --> 12:20.867
You don't remember
first getting them.

12:20.867 --> 12:21.967
Nope.

12:21.967 --> 12:23.533
That's like kids
with the Internet today.

12:23.533 --> 12:25.066
They've just always had it.

12:25.066 --> 12:27.934
Greg,
your challenge today

12:27.934 --> 12:32.166
is called
"Bird is the Word."

12:32.166 --> 12:33.400
Next to us is a jukebox

12:33.400 --> 12:35.967
packed with a playlist
of bird songs.

12:35.967 --> 12:38.066
One by one, the panelists
will come up

12:38.066 --> 12:40.533
and drop a coin
in that slot,

12:40.533 --> 12:41.767
choose one of the tracks,

12:41.767 --> 12:42.934
and a bird song will play.

12:42.934 --> 12:45.700
Your job is to identify
the specific bird

12:45.700 --> 12:49.000
from the more than 10,000
species of birds in the world.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.200
Okay, Mike,
how's your singing voice

12:52.200 --> 12:54.300
if you impersonate the birds?

12:54.300 --> 12:56.533
Well, not as good
as Christina's boxing,
of course.

12:56.533 --> 12:58.300
Oh!
( laughs )

12:58.300 --> 12:59.700
Yeah, this is
a good comparison.

12:59.700 --> 13:01.767
So, Christina,
how's your boxing?

13:01.767 --> 13:03.600
Oh, my boxing's amazing.

13:03.600 --> 13:05.734
I got a punch.
I got a real punch.

13:05.734 --> 13:08.600
( vocalizing )
Whoo-whoo, whoo-whoo!

13:08.600 --> 13:11.767
Just as good
as Mike's singing.

13:11.767 --> 13:13.433
Greg, how you feeling?

13:13.433 --> 13:14.600
- Good.
- You feel good? All right.

13:14.600 --> 13:16.667
- I'm ready.
- Please take your place

13:16.667 --> 13:17.767
in our Superhuman chair.

13:17.767 --> 13:19.200
Watch your step.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.567
Greg, you will only
have a matter of seconds

13:24.567 --> 13:26.033
to identify each bird.

13:26.033 --> 13:28.700
Your challenge starts now.

13:30.734 --> 13:34.767
Mike, come on up,
drop the first coin
in the slot.

13:34.767 --> 13:36.266
May I have a quarter?
I saw the quarters there.

13:36.266 --> 13:37.700
I got you.

13:41.800 --> 13:45.300
( bird chirps )

13:45.300 --> 13:48.934
Greg, can you identify
the first bird?

13:50.433 --> 13:51.934
It's a bright yellow bird.

13:51.934 --> 13:54.500
It's very small.
It's a yellow warbler.

13:54.500 --> 13:59.433
A yellow warbler.
Let's see if that's correct.

13:59.433 --> 14:01.734
That is
a yellow warbler!

14:01.734 --> 14:03.900
Wow.

14:03.900 --> 14:05.266
Okay, let's go
to our next bird.

14:05.266 --> 14:06.266
Christina,
come on up.

14:06.266 --> 14:08.133
Drop a coin
in the slot.

14:08.133 --> 14:10.367
Select a track.

14:10.367 --> 14:12.100
All right.

14:16.100 --> 14:18.600
( bird chirps )

14:20.867 --> 14:22.133
Okay, Greg.

14:22.133 --> 14:24.400
Can you identify
the second bird?

14:24.400 --> 14:28.233
Um, it is, like,
a small, white bird

14:28.233 --> 14:31.600
that's been dipped in,
uh, raspberry sauce.

14:31.600 --> 14:34.467
That is a purple finch.

14:34.467 --> 14:36.800
A purple finch.
Let's see if you're right.

14:38.767 --> 14:40.767
Purple finch!

14:40.767 --> 14:42.533
( bird chirps )

14:42.533 --> 14:44.200
That's two for two.

14:44.200 --> 14:45.900
You need to recognize
this final song

14:45.900 --> 14:47.667
to get a perfect score.

14:47.667 --> 14:49.867
Dr. Jandial,
please come up.

14:49.867 --> 14:52.600
Drop our last coin in
and select a track.

14:59.367 --> 15:03.200
( bird chirps )

15:06.533 --> 15:08.100
Okay, Greg.

15:08.100 --> 15:12.100
Can you identify
the third and final bird?

15:12.100 --> 15:14.767
This bird is reddish brown,

15:14.767 --> 15:17.867
has a long, thin,
decurved beak

15:17.867 --> 15:21.000
which it uses
to reach between rocks

15:21.000 --> 15:23.567
to extract insects.

15:23.567 --> 15:26.433
That one is a canyon wren.

15:26.433 --> 15:28.467
From the 10,000 birds
it could be,

15:28.467 --> 15:31.066
let's see
if you're correct.

15:31.066 --> 15:32.100
( bird chirps )

15:32.100 --> 15:33.300
- You are correct!
- Yeah!

15:33.300 --> 15:35.033
Congratulations!
Come on down here.

15:35.033 --> 15:37.667
That is awesome.

15:37.667 --> 15:39.834
Oh, man, Greg.

15:46.333 --> 15:48.834
Christina,
you have an amazing ear.

15:48.834 --> 15:52.233
As a musician, I assume you have
to be impressed by Greg's ear.

15:52.233 --> 15:53.767
Oh,
I'm completely impressed.

15:53.767 --> 15:55.400
I mean, you weren't
even looking at the screen.

15:55.400 --> 15:57.367
You're just hearing
"Tweet, tweet, tweet,

15:57.367 --> 15:58.967
tweet, tweet, tweet,
tweet, tweet, tweet, tweet."

15:58.967 --> 16:00.433
That is definitely superhuman.

16:00.433 --> 16:02.000
That's awesome.

16:02.000 --> 16:03.667
Dr. Jandial,

16:03.667 --> 16:04.967
how is hearing
handled in the brain?

16:04.967 --> 16:08.467
Well, hearing is handled
by the sound processing system,

16:08.467 --> 16:09.934
and that's called
the auditory cortex.

16:09.934 --> 16:11.266
You have it on both sides,

16:11.266 --> 16:13.900
but what he's showing here
is way more than that.

16:13.900 --> 16:15.300
I wonder if there's
some neural plasticity.

16:15.300 --> 16:18.266
Like, some brain-shaping
that happened over decades

16:18.266 --> 16:20.166
where he's just hearing
these amazing bird songs.

16:20.166 --> 16:22.834
And I think that's where
he's harnessing this power

16:22.834 --> 16:25.900
of separating out these
highly similar, if you will,

16:25.900 --> 16:28.367
bird songs
that we heard today.

16:28.367 --> 16:31.000
Will Greg be singing
all the way to the bank?

16:31.000 --> 16:33.667
It's all up to our judges
and our audience,

16:33.667 --> 16:36.033
but for now,
give it up for Greg Miller.

16:36.033 --> 16:38.133
Thanks, Greg.
We'll see you later in the show.

16:38.133 --> 16:40.000
Nicely done. Thank you.

16:44.367 --> 16:47.166
$355 a month.
$900 for warranty.

16:47.166 --> 16:48.667
Taxes $615.

16:48.667 --> 16:49.867
What is the price?

16:49.867 --> 16:52.200
I'm between two prices
right now...

16:52.200 --> 16:53.900
Uh...

17:03.333 --> 17:06.500
This Mensa member
from Skokie, Illinois

17:06.500 --> 17:09.867
travels the country teaching
kids to hone their math skills,

17:09.867 --> 17:12.200
all the while
instructing his son

17:12.200 --> 17:13.333
on the tricks of the trade.

17:13.333 --> 17:16.066
It's superhuman Mike Byster.

17:16.066 --> 17:18.934
( cheers and applause )

17:18.934 --> 17:20.666
My name is Mike Byster,

17:20.666 --> 17:23.333
and my superhuman ability
is mental math.

17:23.333 --> 17:24.733
In fact,
I have one of the fastest

17:24.733 --> 17:26.200
math minds in the world.

17:26.200 --> 17:29.433
I can solve almost any
math problem instantaneously.

17:29.433 --> 17:31.767
I have a 17-year-old son Josh,

17:31.767 --> 17:34.433
and we play these
crazy games together.

17:34.433 --> 17:37.300
What day of the week did
May 29th, 2012 fall on?

17:37.300 --> 17:39.233
Uh, that was a Tuesday?

17:39.233 --> 17:41.500
We are so inseparable,
it's not even funny.

17:41.500 --> 17:43.600
Tuesday, right.
I had to think of it.

17:43.600 --> 17:44.600
Good job.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.233
My son is my best friend.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.300
Josh thinks the way I think.

17:48.300 --> 17:50.266
And we both think
outside the box.

17:50.266 --> 17:51.900
It's great to be different.

17:51.900 --> 17:53.200
The people that are different

17:53.200 --> 17:55.834
are the ones
that change the world.

17:55.834 --> 17:56.867
( cheers and applause )

17:56.867 --> 17:57.967
From Skokie, Illinois,

17:57.967 --> 17:59.734
please welcome Mike Byster!

18:06.400 --> 18:08.000
- Hey, Mike!
- Hey, Kal. How are ya?

18:08.000 --> 18:09.500
Good.
Welcome to "Superhuman."

18:09.500 --> 18:10.834
Thank you.

18:10.834 --> 18:12.867
It's nice to see how close
you are with your son.

18:12.867 --> 18:14.033
My son's my best friend.

18:14.033 --> 18:15.567
- Where is he?
- Josh?

18:15.567 --> 18:17.633
Hey, Josh. How are you?

18:17.633 --> 18:19.800
Welcome to "Superhuman."

18:19.800 --> 18:23.900
Well, Mike, your challenge
is called "Fast Car."

18:23.900 --> 18:26.533
As you can see,
we've transformed our stage

18:26.533 --> 18:30.033
into a superhuman used car lot
with three cars.

18:30.033 --> 18:32.300
In a moment,
you'll use your math skills

18:32.300 --> 18:34.600
to figure out
the sticker price of each car,

18:34.600 --> 18:37.433
but to do that, you'll need
all the options, fees,

18:37.433 --> 18:39.400
taxes,
and other specific costs

18:39.400 --> 18:40.867
associated with these cars.

18:40.867 --> 18:42.667
And if
that's not hard enough,

18:42.667 --> 18:44.767
you'll be given
all this information

18:44.767 --> 18:46.600
by our superhuman car salesman

18:46.600 --> 18:49.033
known as Mighty Mouth,

18:49.033 --> 18:51.900
the former Guinness record
holder for fast talking,

18:51.900 --> 18:53.900
Mr. John Moschitta.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.100
( cheers and applause )

19:01.400 --> 19:02.867
Hey, John.
How are you, man?

19:02.867 --> 19:04.000
I'm just dandy.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.800
- Welcome to "Superhuman."
- Thank you.

19:05.800 --> 19:07.567
John, you got
a great jacket, John.

19:07.567 --> 19:09.600
I noticed the jacket.
You're very stylish.

19:09.600 --> 19:11.133
Just for you. They said,
"You know, Mike is really
gonna look for you

19:11.133 --> 19:12.233
to have something
really nice on,"

19:12.233 --> 19:13.734
and I said, "Well,
I wanna have something nice,

19:13.734 --> 19:14.867
'cause I want Mike to think
I'm a really cool guy,"

19:14.867 --> 19:17.200
so this is what
they gave me.

19:17.200 --> 19:20.266
All right, John!

19:20.266 --> 19:22.200
All right, it's time
to go car shopping.

19:22.200 --> 19:25.400
Panel, please take your
positions next to each car

19:25.400 --> 19:27.734
as you'll be revealing
the sticker prices

19:27.734 --> 19:29.500
to see if they match
Mike's answers.

19:32.200 --> 19:34.166
All right, Mike.
You ready?

19:34.166 --> 19:35.200
I think so.

19:35.200 --> 19:40.100
Your challenge starts now.

19:40.100 --> 19:44.266
John, tell us about
the first car, please.

19:44.266 --> 19:46.767
You know, sport, I can see
you're a gear head.

19:46.767 --> 19:48.567
That's why I have this
vintage muscle car for you.

19:48.567 --> 19:51.400
Sticker price is $525
a month over 36 months.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.166
But you can subtract
a bit for the following--

19:53.166 --> 19:54.834
( speaking rapidly )
$275 for squeaky brakes,

19:54.834 --> 19:56.533
$200 for no working radio,

19:56.533 --> 19:58.100
$300 for a missing muffler,

19:58.100 --> 19:59.767
$720 for a rusty tuning belt,

19:59.767 --> 20:01.567
and $4,100
for lack of an engine.

20:01.567 --> 20:03.200
However,
I do need to tack on

20:03.200 --> 20:05.166
a finder's fee of $950,

20:05.166 --> 20:07.000
but let's knock off $695
for your trade-in.

20:07.000 --> 20:10.000
But let's add in $800
for modified tires.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.033
But we can remove $35
for seatbelt readjustment.

20:12.033 --> 20:13.767
It is a convertible,
and as you know, Mike,

20:13.767 --> 20:15.567
as the top goes down,
the price goes up,

20:15.567 --> 20:16.967
so we're gonna need to add
an extra monthly payment

20:16.967 --> 20:18.066
of $525.

20:18.066 --> 20:20.133
Taxes, tags,
title, and rebate

20:20.133 --> 20:22.300
will add another
$1,965 on the top,

20:22.300 --> 20:24.900
but beyond that,
this little kiddie
is all yours!

20:24.900 --> 20:27.233
( applause )

20:31.133 --> 20:34.300
What is the price
of the first car, please?

20:34.300 --> 20:36.633
Uh...

20:36.633 --> 20:38.834
Take your time.

20:38.834 --> 20:41.166
$16,815?

20:41.166 --> 20:44.266
You heard $16,815?

20:44.266 --> 20:45.600
I don't know, I think so.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.467
I mean,
it's between one of two.

20:47.467 --> 20:49.867
Dr. Jandial, please show us
the price of the car.

20:54.667 --> 21:00.467
Oh! Whoa!

21:00.467 --> 21:02.066
Whoa!

21:02.066 --> 21:04.667
Wow, Mike.

21:04.667 --> 21:06.867
Christina:
 That was great.

21:06.867 --> 21:08.433
Okay, all right.

21:08.433 --> 21:09.900
- Mike, are you ready?
- Uh, yeah.

21:09.900 --> 21:12.667
John, it's time
for car number two.

21:12.667 --> 21:14.433
You look like you drive
a hard bargain,

21:14.433 --> 21:16.033
and this roomy station wagon

21:16.033 --> 21:17.166
will save some room
in your wallet

21:17.166 --> 21:18.767
with a low monthly rate
of $355 a month

21:18.767 --> 21:20.066
for 48 months.

21:20.066 --> 21:21.266
Now, let's talk features.

21:21.266 --> 21:22.767
First, a $40 fee
for power windows.

21:22.767 --> 21:23.767
That's per window, of course,

21:23.767 --> 21:25.000
and there are five windows.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.367
$900 for a bumper
to bumper warranty.

21:26.367 --> 21:27.967
There's two bumpers on the car,
so double that.

21:27.967 --> 21:29.667
$530 for an anti-theft device.

21:29.667 --> 21:31.533
$375 for whisper-quiet
air conditioning

21:31.533 --> 21:33.633
that you'll sweat--
I mean swear wasn't even on.

21:33.633 --> 21:35.533
$225 for the cassette player,

21:35.533 --> 21:37.333
and I'm gonna sell you
ten cassette tapes

21:37.333 --> 21:39.567
I got at a yard sale
for just $1.50 a piece.

21:39.567 --> 21:41.133
However, you will also
need to include

21:41.133 --> 21:42.533
a one-time
engine installation fee

21:42.533 --> 21:43.767
of $615,

21:43.767 --> 21:46.934
a two-time fluids
refill fee of $380,

21:46.934 --> 21:48.800
a three-time tire
rotation fee of $60,

21:48.800 --> 21:51.400
and a single-time
towing fee of $240.

21:51.400 --> 21:53.500
Your trade-in
will take off $810,

21:53.500 --> 21:56.333
and I'll even knock
two of those $1.50
cassette tapes off the bill.

21:56.333 --> 21:59.467
So how about it?
We got a deal?

21:59.467 --> 22:02.900
( applause )

22:02.900 --> 22:05.734
Oh, my God.
Uh, I'm between
two prices right now.

22:05.734 --> 22:09.233
I'm-- uh...

22:09.233 --> 22:11.734
it's either 21,167

22:11.734 --> 22:13.700
or 21,157.

22:13.700 --> 22:18.533
I gotta go with 21,167,
and I'll--

22:18.533 --> 22:20.633
21,167.

22:20.633 --> 22:23.834
Might be 57, but 67.

22:23.834 --> 22:25.133
Christina,
what's the price of the car?

22:30.400 --> 22:32.467
Oh!

22:32.467 --> 22:34.667
( cheers and applause )

22:34.667 --> 22:36.033
Oh!

22:36.033 --> 22:39.333
- Man!
- How'd you do that?

22:39.333 --> 22:42.233
Oh, my gosh!

22:42.233 --> 22:46.300
Whoa.

22:46.300 --> 22:49.166
Mike, are you ready
to continue?

22:49.166 --> 22:50.433
I think so.

22:50.433 --> 22:51.867
All right, Mike,
keep your brain going

22:51.867 --> 22:53.367
for the last sales pitch.

22:53.367 --> 22:56.367
John, rev up your tongue
and sell, sell, sell.

22:59.900 --> 23:02.100
My friend, you look like
a smart fellow,

23:02.100 --> 23:03.400
so there's only one
ride you need.

23:03.400 --> 23:05.600
It's the 1983 conversion van.

23:05.600 --> 23:06.967
It has it all.
Power windows, power brakes,

23:06.967 --> 23:08.467
power locks, power seats,
and power steering,

23:08.467 --> 23:10.066
and this automobile
is a literal steal

23:10.066 --> 23:12.233
at just $320 a month
for 60 months.

23:12.233 --> 23:13.767
Of course,
that's just the base model.

23:13.767 --> 23:14.767
This little beauty
is a little extra.

23:14.767 --> 23:16.967
Add on $220 for the windows,

23:16.967 --> 23:18.500
$550 for the power brakes,

23:18.500 --> 23:19.533
$80 for the power locks,

23:19.533 --> 23:21.033
$195 for the power seats.

23:21.033 --> 23:23.333
$625 for the Mad Dog
security system.

23:23.333 --> 23:25.000
$30 a month for for five years
for satellite radio.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.667
Actually, I'll throw the radio's
first month in free.

23:27.667 --> 23:29.800
And the power steering?
I'll throw that in for free too,

23:29.800 --> 23:31.900
except a fee of $210.

23:31.900 --> 23:33.934
But hold on.
You are a safe driver,

23:33.934 --> 23:36.133
so we'll knock $10 off
of all 60 monthly payments,

23:36.133 --> 23:38.166
and on top of that,
your trade-in equals $820

23:38.166 --> 23:39.266
off the total too.

23:39.266 --> 23:40.300
But before we go
any further,

23:40.300 --> 23:41.600
you'll also need a warranty.

23:41.600 --> 23:43.867
Just $45 a month over the course
of the 60-month lease.

23:43.867 --> 23:45.633
Then there's all that
legal mumbo-jumbo,

23:45.633 --> 23:47.233
so you've gotta add taxes,
title, and rebate,

23:47.233 --> 23:50.500
which puts a very tiny
$2,830 on the bill.

23:50.500 --> 23:52.000
And, heck, I like you,

23:52.000 --> 23:53.967
so I'm willing to take
a flat 10%

23:53.967 --> 23:55.100
off the top of this bad boy.

23:55.100 --> 23:57.033
What do you say?
Can I get you in this car today?

23:57.033 --> 24:00.166
( cheers and applause )

24:00.166 --> 24:03.200
Kal:
 What is the price
 of the third car?

24:06.934 --> 24:09.200
Mike:
 Uh...

24:14.133 --> 24:16.900
...before the discount,
it was $26,950.

24:16.900 --> 24:18.166
With the discount,

24:18.166 --> 24:23.133
we're looking at $24,264.

24:23.133 --> 24:24.734
Are you sure, man?

24:24.734 --> 24:27.266
I am so not sure.

24:27.266 --> 24:28.834
I'm with you.
I'm with you, so...

24:28.834 --> 24:33.000
$24,264. Please, Mike.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.734
Mr. Mike Tyson,
please show us the price
of the car.

24:40.333 --> 24:42.800
Yah!

24:42.800 --> 24:45.400
Oh!

24:45.400 --> 24:47.300
( cheers and applause )

24:47.300 --> 24:49.800
Oh, my gosh!

24:53.867 --> 24:58.166
That's insane.

24:58.166 --> 25:03.567
Let's thank John Moschitta
for his fast and furious facts.

25:03.567 --> 25:04.600
Thank you, John.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.200
Congratulations.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.800
Whoo!

25:08.800 --> 25:11.066
Okay.

25:15.166 --> 25:16.333
Dr. Jandial,

25:16.333 --> 25:19.200
does the brain process
hit on the speed factor?

25:19.200 --> 25:21.066
How do we make calculations
at lightning speed?

25:21.066 --> 25:22.300
This was phenomenal,

25:22.300 --> 25:24.800
because definitely
the brain processes sight

25:24.800 --> 25:26.033
faster than it does sound.

25:26.033 --> 25:27.700
So, yes,
the math was hard.

25:27.700 --> 25:30.000
Yes, everything was happening
at lightning speed.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.367
But the fact
that you were hearing it

25:31.367 --> 25:33.066
when I think about
what's going on in your brain,

25:33.066 --> 25:34.166
that's the thing that
stands out the most.

25:34.166 --> 25:36.367
Oh, thank you.

25:36.367 --> 25:37.867
( cheers and applause )

25:37.867 --> 25:39.767
Iron Mike,
what'd you think
of magic Mike?

25:39.767 --> 25:41.200
Hey, man,
that was just amazing.

25:41.200 --> 25:44.033
You're a beautiful guy,
you have awesome personality.

25:44.033 --> 25:47.700
I'm a huge fan.
Thank you.

25:47.700 --> 25:49.233
Mike, you need to hold up
that "Superhuman" sign.

25:49.233 --> 25:51.300
You are the definition
of that.

25:51.300 --> 25:53.133
That was incredible.

25:53.133 --> 25:55.100
That was so cool.

25:55.100 --> 25:56.100
Your son
must be so proud.

25:56.100 --> 25:57.400
That was awesome.

25:57.400 --> 26:00.433
Mike, you're very,
very impressive.

26:00.433 --> 26:02.533
One more time
for Mike Byster, everyone.

26:02.533 --> 26:04.667
Thank you.
We'll see you later on
in the show.

26:04.667 --> 26:06.867
Really nicely done.
Whoo!

26:06.867 --> 26:09.433
Coming up, a college student

26:09.433 --> 26:12.333
who has found a way
to rewrite her brain.

26:12.333 --> 26:14.033
Let's just say
she's very well-versed

26:14.033 --> 26:15.700
in reverse.

26:15.700 --> 26:18.033
Check it out when
"Superhuman" continues.

26:28.600 --> 26:30.900
Hey, welcome back
to "Superhuman."

26:30.900 --> 26:33.300
Our next contestant
is a word wizard

26:33.300 --> 26:35.100
who can take
backward language

26:35.100 --> 26:36.266
and turn it forward.

26:36.266 --> 26:37.734
She's Alyssa Kramer.

26:37.734 --> 26:39.433
( cheers and applause )

26:39.433 --> 26:41.066
Hi, I'm Alyssa Kramer,

26:41.066 --> 26:42.767
and my superhuman ability

26:42.767 --> 26:44.734
is that I can rearrange
any word

26:44.734 --> 26:46.166
frontwards to backwards
instantly.

26:46.166 --> 26:47.900
The way that it happens
in my brain

26:47.900 --> 26:49.667
is I will picture
the word in my head,

26:49.667 --> 26:51.033
whether it's said
or whether I'm reading it,

26:51.033 --> 26:53.300
and I'll just flip it
in my brain really fast.

26:53.300 --> 26:54.967
This was an ability
I was born with,

26:54.967 --> 26:56.700
so I think it would be
pretty impossible

26:56.700 --> 26:58.000
for me to teach
someone else.

26:58.000 --> 26:59.000
I'm gonna give it my all,

26:59.000 --> 27:00.300
gonna have a blast,

27:00.300 --> 27:04.533
and I'm gonna take home
that college money.

27:04.533 --> 27:06.400
From Poteau, Oklahoma,

27:06.400 --> 27:08.333
please welcome
"Assyla Remark."

27:13.400 --> 27:16.133
- Hello.
- Hello.

27:16.133 --> 27:17.600
- How are you?
- I'm great. How are you?

27:17.600 --> 27:19.033
Good.
Welcome to "Superhuman."

27:19.033 --> 27:20.734
Did I get that right?
"Assyla Remark"?

27:20.734 --> 27:23.000
- Yes, sir, you did.
- Yes!

27:23.000 --> 27:26.400
Alyssa, your challenge
is called "Namuh Repus."

27:26.400 --> 27:28.333
That's "Superhuman" backwards.

27:28.333 --> 27:29.367
All right.

27:29.367 --> 27:30.934
In this challenge,

27:30.934 --> 27:33.333
you're going to hear
15 random words

27:33.333 --> 27:36.000
one at a time,
that are spoken backwards

27:36.000 --> 27:37.867
by our computer.

27:37.867 --> 27:38.900
Ooh.

27:38.900 --> 27:39.967
When you hear those words,

27:39.967 --> 27:41.667
your job
is to descramble each one

27:41.667 --> 27:43.333
and say the words forward.

27:43.333 --> 27:45.166
But you'll have
to do it quickly,

27:45.166 --> 27:47.233
because you'll only
have 60 seconds

27:47.233 --> 27:49.166
to complete all 15 words.

27:49.166 --> 27:50.567
All right.

27:50.567 --> 27:51.667
Dr. Jandial, how does
this talent compare

27:51.667 --> 27:52.867
with similar brain tests,

27:52.867 --> 27:54.667
like saying
the alphabet backwards?

27:54.667 --> 27:56.633
Well, this is tricky.
Now, let's look at numbers
for a second.

27:56.633 --> 27:58.500
I'll give my panelists
a challenge here.

27:58.500 --> 28:00.667
If you count backwards
from 10 for me please, Mike.

28:00.667 --> 28:02.166
I don't look
at numbers period.

28:02.166 --> 28:03.567
Unless they got dollar signs.

28:03.567 --> 28:04.934
They don't got
a dollar sign, I'm--

28:04.934 --> 28:07.166
Doing it backwards again.
I'm gonna ask Christina.

28:07.166 --> 28:08.767
If you count from 10
backwards, how does it go?

28:08.767 --> 28:10.433
10, nine, eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one.

28:10.433 --> 28:11.967
Yeah, but that's--
see, that's fluid.

28:11.967 --> 28:14.734
Numbers going
forward or backwards,
a two-way street.

28:14.734 --> 28:17.266
But now if we try to do
the alphabet backwards--

28:17.266 --> 28:20.300
Z, Y...
it's clunky, right?

28:20.300 --> 28:21.333
It's not fluid.

28:21.333 --> 28:22.900
So language
is a one-way street.

28:22.900 --> 28:24.400
You're really not supposed

28:24.400 --> 28:25.700
to conceptualize it
going backwards,

28:25.700 --> 28:26.700
and that's why
I'm really excited to see

28:26.700 --> 28:27.934
what she's gonna show today.

28:27.934 --> 28:29.934
Awesome. Right on.

28:29.934 --> 28:32.900
Okay, Alyssa, you'll notice
that our "Superhuman" chair

28:32.900 --> 28:35.300
is fittingly turned backward,
away from the screen.

28:35.300 --> 28:38.200
That's because you'll only
be able to hear the words

28:38.200 --> 28:40.633
and not see them, making it
much harder for you.

28:40.633 --> 28:42.734
- Please take a seat.
- All right.

28:45.600 --> 28:47.867
Your challenge
starts... now.

28:49.133 --> 28:53.967
Here come the words.

28:53.967 --> 28:56.533
- Male voice: Elggig. 
- Giggle.

28:56.533 --> 29:00.166
- Kcommah. 
- Hammock.

29:00.166 --> 29:03.834
- Tnahpele. 
- Elephant.

29:03.834 --> 29:07.467
- Desuma. 
- Amused.

29:07.467 --> 29:11.333
- Kravdraa. 
- Aardvark.

29:11.333 --> 29:15.333
- Noitacav. 
- Vacation.

29:15.333 --> 29:16.500
Wow.

29:16.500 --> 29:20.300
- Emitwohs. 
- Showtime.

29:20.300 --> 29:23.567
- Redaelreehc. 
- Cheerleader.

29:23.567 --> 29:27.800
- Tsagrebbalf. 
- Flabbergast.

29:27.800 --> 29:32.000
- Gniyfitarg. 
- Gratifying.

29:32.000 --> 29:36.934
- Suoitneterp. 
- Pretentious.

29:36.934 --> 29:41.200
- Cinortcele. 
- Electronic.

29:41.200 --> 29:44.367
- Noisivelet. 
- Television.

29:44.367 --> 29:47.867
- Rotaregirfer. 
- Refrigerator.

29:47.867 --> 29:52.367
- Sumatopoppih. 
- Hippopotamus.

29:54.033 --> 29:58.333
Oh! Oh-ho-ho-ho!

29:58.333 --> 30:02.200
- That's awesome.
- Thank you.

30:02.200 --> 30:05.266
Dr. Jandial, this is such
an unusual skill.

30:05.266 --> 30:07.367
Are most brains
equipped to do this?

30:07.367 --> 30:09.200
No, actually,
she's going against

30:09.200 --> 30:10.200
the direction
that we're designed.

30:10.200 --> 30:12.500
And what she did
here instantly--

30:12.500 --> 30:15.967
you know, I was floored
by what I saw.

30:15.967 --> 30:17.400
That's just amazing.

30:17.400 --> 30:19.400
Since I been here,
that's just the most
remarkable--

30:19.400 --> 30:21.000
you know, backwards.

30:21.000 --> 30:23.333
Give me a break. Backwards.

30:23.333 --> 30:24.667
Nice job, Alyssa.

30:24.667 --> 30:25.700
Thank you.

30:25.700 --> 30:26.700
We will see you
at the end of the show.

30:26.700 --> 30:27.800
- All right.
- Well done.

30:27.800 --> 30:29.367
Thank you.

30:29.367 --> 30:32.934
( cheers and applause )

30:34.166 --> 30:36.567
Your job is to take
everybody's order.

30:36.567 --> 30:38.000
You'll have no pen, no pad,

30:38.000 --> 30:39.233
just brain power.

30:39.233 --> 30:41.166
- I will have garlic bread...
- Calamari...

30:41.166 --> 30:42.800
- Rigatoni.
- Alfredo.

30:42.800 --> 30:43.867
And the Italian wedding cake.

30:43.867 --> 30:45.800
Uh, what's
the last one again?

30:54.667 --> 30:58.700
This superhuman grew up
in India and France.

30:58.700 --> 31:01.166
As a kid, his father
taught him chess

31:01.166 --> 31:02.967
to instill
an intellectual edge.

31:02.967 --> 31:06.200
Meet memory master Ram Kolli.

31:06.200 --> 31:08.367
( cheers and applause )

31:08.367 --> 31:09.767
My name is Ram Kolli,

31:09.767 --> 31:12.200
and my superhuman ability
is my memory.

31:12.200 --> 31:14.700
I can mentally file
any kind of information.

31:14.700 --> 31:17.433
Once I see or hear something,
I never forget.

31:17.433 --> 31:20.567
My dad got me playing chess
very early on.

31:20.567 --> 31:23.533
Just playing chess
expands your mental ability.

31:23.533 --> 31:24.967
Think it's going to be great

31:24.967 --> 31:26.934
to have a family,
to raise a family.

31:26.934 --> 31:29.433
I really wanna
have faith in my memory,

31:29.433 --> 31:33.266
to be able to do
the best I can.

31:33.266 --> 31:34.967
From Los Angeles, California,

31:34.967 --> 31:37.100
please welcome Ram Kolli!

31:37.100 --> 31:39.734
( cheers and applause )

31:42.233 --> 31:44.100
- Hey, Kal.
- Hello. How are you, Ram?

31:44.100 --> 31:45.900
Good, good.

31:45.900 --> 31:47.467
And where's your--
where's your wife Alka?

31:47.467 --> 31:48.700
My wife's, uh,
right there.

31:48.700 --> 31:51.400
Hi, Alka. How are you?

31:51.400 --> 31:54.066
Uh, does Ram ever
forget anything?

31:54.066 --> 31:56.066
- All the time.
- Like what?

31:56.066 --> 31:58.266
Um, he forgets his parents'
anniversary every year.

31:58.266 --> 32:00.967
Man, you just got
thrown under the bus

32:00.967 --> 32:04.367
in front of your parents
on national television

32:04.367 --> 32:07.767
by your wife.

32:07.767 --> 32:10.500
Ram, your challenge
is called "Waiting on You."

32:10.500 --> 32:11.900
As you can see behind us,

32:11.900 --> 32:13.600
our stage has been
transformed

32:13.600 --> 32:15.800
into a lovely
Italian restaurant.

32:15.800 --> 32:18.567
These 15 hungry customers
behind us

32:18.567 --> 32:20.233
are waiting
to place their order.

32:20.233 --> 32:23.033
Your job is to take
everybody's order,

32:23.033 --> 32:25.066
however you'll have no pen,

32:25.066 --> 32:27.567
no pad, just brain power.

32:27.567 --> 32:29.834
Each customer will order
from a menu

32:29.834 --> 32:33.567
that has 10 appetizers,
10 entrees, and 10 desserts.

32:33.567 --> 32:36.967
Every customer
will order one of each.

32:36.967 --> 32:41.133
With 15 people, that's 15,000
possible combinations.

32:41.133 --> 32:43.400
Okay, Ram,
it's time to serve up

32:43.400 --> 32:44.967
some superhuman skills.

32:44.967 --> 32:48.166
Your challenge starts...
now.

32:52.333 --> 32:56.100
I will have garlic bread,
linguine carbonara,

32:56.100 --> 32:58.433
and gelato sundae.

32:58.433 --> 32:59.834
The stuffed squash blossoms,

32:59.834 --> 33:02.300
rigatoni,
and mixed-berry crumble.

33:02.300 --> 33:05.166
I will have the calamari,
eggplant Parmesan,

33:05.166 --> 33:06.433
and the tiramisu.

33:06.433 --> 33:08.367
Risotto
with grilled shrimp,

33:08.367 --> 33:11.967
fettuccine alfredo,
and the blackberry tart.

33:11.967 --> 33:13.200
The chicken flatbread,

33:13.200 --> 33:14.767
spaghetti and meatballs,

33:14.767 --> 33:16.266
and the raspberry trifle.

33:16.266 --> 33:17.900
Uh, what's the last one again?

33:17.900 --> 33:19.367
The raspberry trifle.

33:19.367 --> 33:21.066
Would you like that
whole order again?

33:21.066 --> 33:24.033
Um...

33:24.033 --> 33:27.500
I'm good.

33:27.500 --> 33:29.567
One by one,
each of our panelists

33:29.567 --> 33:32.633
is going to bring out a cart
with three dishes on it.

33:32.633 --> 33:35.200
They will then tell us
which customers' order

33:35.200 --> 33:38.333
you'll need
to accurately recite.

33:38.333 --> 33:40.333
Mike, please bring out
the first cart.

33:40.333 --> 33:43.166
All right.

33:51.533 --> 33:53.700
Mike, which customer
ordered this food?

33:53.700 --> 33:55.633
This lady right here.

33:55.633 --> 33:57.800
Ram, please tell us
what this guest

33:57.800 --> 34:02.166
is having
as an appetizer.

34:02.166 --> 34:05.567
You've had, uh, bruschetta.

34:05.567 --> 34:08.699
( bell rings, applause )

34:08.699 --> 34:13.467
The, uh, entree please.

34:13.467 --> 34:15.065
The lobster ravioli.

34:18.132 --> 34:20.734
Finally, Ram,
what was the desert
that this guest wanted?

34:20.734 --> 34:22.934
Chocolate biscotti.

34:22.934 --> 34:27.467
Yes. Whoa, dude.

34:27.467 --> 34:30.199
One down, two to go.
You ready for your next order?

34:30.199 --> 34:31.600
- Yes, sir.
- Okay.

34:31.600 --> 34:34.400
Christina, it's time
to bring out our second cart.

34:34.400 --> 34:36.333
Coming through.

34:40.065 --> 34:42.033
Christina, which guest
ordered the food

34:42.033 --> 34:43.065
that you brought?

34:43.065 --> 34:44.600
This lady right here
in the middle.

34:44.600 --> 34:45.734
Right in the middle.
All right.

34:45.734 --> 34:47.734
It's time
to test you again, Ram.

34:47.734 --> 34:49.533
What did the lady
in the middle

34:49.533 --> 34:50.800
order as an appetizer?

34:55.233 --> 34:58.100
Was, um, calamari.

34:58.100 --> 35:00.133
( bell rings, applause )

35:00.133 --> 35:05.467
What was the entree?

35:05.467 --> 35:08.300
Eggplant Parmesan.

35:08.300 --> 35:11.500
Voila.

35:11.500 --> 35:15.133
Finally, please tell us
this guest's dessert order.

35:15.133 --> 35:17.233
One of my favorites--
tiramisu.

35:17.233 --> 35:21.266
Ooh. Let's see. Tiramisu!

35:22.500 --> 35:26.133
Oh, man.
Two down, one to go, Ram.

35:26.133 --> 35:27.200
Thank you, Christina.

35:27.200 --> 35:28.767
Thank you.

35:28.767 --> 35:30.967
Dr. Jandial, please come out
with the final cart.

35:33.967 --> 35:35.100
Okay, Dr. Jandial,

35:35.100 --> 35:37.000
which guest ordered
the food you have?

35:37.000 --> 35:38.266
The woman on the right.

35:38.266 --> 35:39.700
Ram, this is the final test

35:39.700 --> 35:41.367
to prove your
superhuman ability.

35:41.367 --> 35:43.100
What did the customer
on the right

35:43.100 --> 35:44.567
order as her appetizer?

35:44.567 --> 35:46.934
( exhales )

35:46.934 --> 35:48.767
Mozzarella sticks.

35:51.100 --> 35:52.200
Whoo!

35:52.200 --> 35:55.967
What was this guest's
entree?

35:55.967 --> 35:58.600
You have
the fettuccine alfredo.

36:03.333 --> 36:07.266
Finally, Ram, please tell us
this guest's dessert.

36:07.266 --> 36:11.033
Um...

36:11.033 --> 36:13.400
uh, cannoli
is my wife's favorite.

36:13.400 --> 36:14.767
This is cannoli.

36:14.767 --> 36:17.266
All right, let's see
if you've got cannoli.

36:17.266 --> 36:19.734
Are you sure?

36:19.734 --> 36:21.533
( sighs )

36:21.533 --> 36:22.834
Um...

36:25.600 --> 36:27.667
I am positive.

36:27.667 --> 36:29.266
There we go.

36:29.266 --> 36:32.166
Oh, dude!

36:32.166 --> 36:34.367
Oh, my gosh!

36:34.367 --> 36:38.700
Congratulations.

36:38.700 --> 36:43.700
Whoa. Oh!

36:43.700 --> 36:48.333
Whoa!

36:48.333 --> 36:50.000
Uh, Dr. Jandial,

36:50.000 --> 36:51.500
memory is obviously something
that we all have

36:51.500 --> 36:52.734
and use every day,

36:52.734 --> 36:54.934
but why do some people
have better memory than others?

36:54.934 --> 36:56.166
It's a matter of practice.

36:56.166 --> 36:57.700
So think of it this way.

36:57.700 --> 36:59.900
When we're working on our
computers and our laptop

36:59.900 --> 37:02.033
and we wanna save it,
we push the save button

37:02.033 --> 37:03.400
and it goes to our hard drive,

37:03.400 --> 37:05.600
in our brain, that's called
the hippocampus,

37:05.600 --> 37:07.467
so memory is an ability,

37:07.467 --> 37:09.500
but it's something that
you can learn and practice,

37:09.500 --> 37:12.433
and what he has is
superhuman memory ability.

37:12.433 --> 37:13.934
Kal:
 Wow. All right.

37:13.934 --> 37:16.700
Ram, you might have gotten
hungry for pasta and pizza,

37:16.700 --> 37:18.633
but you still could go home
with a lot of dough.

37:18.633 --> 37:22.300
$50,000. Let's hear it
from Ram Kolli.

37:22.300 --> 37:24.000
Stay tuned.
The audience vote is next,

37:24.000 --> 37:25.934
and a winner
will be crowned.

37:34.266 --> 37:36.266
( cheers and applause )

37:36.266 --> 37:38.700
Kal:
 Five amazing people

37:38.700 --> 37:42.100
have exercised
their impressive brainpower

37:42.100 --> 37:44.000
in really
tough challenges tonight,

37:44.000 --> 37:47.367
but now only one of them
is going to win

37:47.367 --> 37:50.967
$50,000 and the title

37:50.967 --> 37:54.300
of "Superhuman"!

37:54.300 --> 37:56.166
The audience
will pick the winner,

37:56.166 --> 37:59.600
but first our panel
will pick the top three.

37:59.600 --> 38:01.033
So, guys, the heat is on.

38:01.033 --> 38:02.867
Please confer and give us
your decision.

38:02.867 --> 38:04.667
While they discuss and decide,

38:04.667 --> 38:08.767
here's a look back at five
of the most incredible people

38:08.767 --> 38:10.734
you will ever see.

38:12.333 --> 38:14.567
The sunglasses
were on the boots.

38:14.567 --> 38:16.400
There were four towels
up here.

38:16.400 --> 38:17.633
This binder was green.

38:17.633 --> 38:18.867
That's absolutely
a change I made.

38:18.867 --> 38:20.800
Oh, my God!

38:23.066 --> 38:24.567
( bird chirps )

38:24.567 --> 38:26.600
A yellow warbler.
Purple finch.

38:26.600 --> 38:28.800
- Canyon wren.
- Holy cow.

38:28.800 --> 38:29.867
Congratulations!

38:31.367 --> 38:32.667
You look like you drive
a hard bargain.

38:32.667 --> 38:34.166
$225
for the cassette player.

38:34.166 --> 38:35.533
Finder's fee of $950,

38:35.533 --> 38:37.433
but let's knock off $695
for your trade-in.

38:37.433 --> 38:38.967
$355 a month for 48 months.

38:38.967 --> 38:42.066
$21,167.

38:42.066 --> 38:44.633
Oh!

38:46.100 --> 38:49.033
- Tsagrebbalf. 
- Flabbergast.

38:49.033 --> 38:51.934
- Gniyfitarg. 
- Gratifying.

38:51.934 --> 38:53.867
- Sumatopoppih. 
- Hippopotamus.

38:53.867 --> 38:55.834
That's it! That's awesome.

38:55.834 --> 38:56.767
Thank you.

38:58.266 --> 38:59.667
Please tell us
what this guest

38:59.667 --> 39:01.033
is having
as an appetizer.

39:01.033 --> 39:03.000
- Bruschetta. 
- What was the entree?

39:03.000 --> 39:04.266
Eggplant Parmesan.

39:04.266 --> 39:06.266
Please tell us
this guest's dessert.

39:06.266 --> 39:07.300
Cannoli
is my wife's favorite.

39:07.300 --> 39:08.333
This is cannoli.

39:08.333 --> 39:12.600
Oh, wow! Oh, my gosh!

39:12.600 --> 39:14.433
( cheers and applause )

39:14.433 --> 39:18.200
Okay, panel, time's up.
This is it.

39:22.533 --> 39:25.433
Mike, who is the first
contestant

39:25.433 --> 39:27.533
the panel is putting
into the top three?

39:27.533 --> 39:28.867
This is very difficult.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.834
It's very, very complex.

39:30.834 --> 39:33.300
We think all of these guys
should be in the finals.

39:33.300 --> 39:35.767
First round goes to...

39:38.166 --> 39:39.333
Mike Byster.

39:39.333 --> 39:42.900
Kal:
 Mike Byster. All right.

39:42.900 --> 39:44.734
Why did you choose
Mike Byster?

39:44.734 --> 39:46.033
I chose him because

39:46.033 --> 39:49.433
everybody needed complete
silence except him.

39:49.433 --> 39:51.500
He was functioning under chaos,

39:51.500 --> 39:53.367
and I thought that was amazing.

39:53.367 --> 39:54.367
Oh, thanks, Mike.

39:54.367 --> 39:56.367
Awesome energy, brother.

39:56.367 --> 39:58.900
( cheers and applause )

39:58.900 --> 40:01.500
Kal: Christina, who's next
 in our top three?

40:01.500 --> 40:03.667
Ah, like Mike said,
that was a total challenge.

40:03.667 --> 40:05.467
By the way, that just brought,
like, a tear to my eye.

40:05.467 --> 40:06.500
I can tell.

40:06.500 --> 40:07.734
Yeah, it was really cool
to see your son

40:07.734 --> 40:08.967
just seem so proud of you,

40:08.967 --> 40:09.967
so, you know,
mission accomplished.

40:09.967 --> 40:11.166
That's great.

40:11.166 --> 40:13.200
You're all so superhuman to us,

40:13.200 --> 40:15.633
but our next choice...

40:15.633 --> 40:16.767
is Greg Miller.

40:16.767 --> 40:18.467
( cheers and applause )

40:18.467 --> 40:21.767
Thank you.

40:21.767 --> 40:23.734
I love how Greg
followed his passion.

40:23.734 --> 40:25.200
Out of 10,000 sounds,

40:25.200 --> 40:27.166
he chose the three
and the right ones,

40:27.166 --> 40:28.934
and exactly who they were,
what they looked like,

40:28.934 --> 40:30.266
and what they sounded like.

40:30.266 --> 40:32.633
That was a beautiful thing,
so great job, Greg.

40:32.633 --> 40:34.633
Thank you.

40:34.633 --> 40:37.033
Okay, Dr. Jandial,
who is taking

40:37.033 --> 40:39.266
the third and final spot
in our top three?

40:39.266 --> 40:40.467
Jandial: I think it was
 really a culmination

40:40.467 --> 40:42.300
of multiple superhuman skills,

40:42.300 --> 40:45.633
but we can only choose one,
and we chose...

40:45.633 --> 40:47.166
Andrea Carlton.

40:47.166 --> 40:49.700
( cheers and applause )

40:49.700 --> 40:52.367
Thank you.

40:52.367 --> 40:55.533
Dr. Jandial, why did the panel
choose Andrea?

40:55.533 --> 40:57.834
So just the mountain
of information

40:57.834 --> 40:59.133
she had to process

40:59.133 --> 41:01.834
and remember from colors,
patterns, numbers.

41:01.834 --> 41:03.767
It was really a culmination

41:03.767 --> 41:05.633
of multiple,
multiple superhuman skills.

41:05.633 --> 41:07.867
Kal: Amazing.
 Congratulations, guys.

41:07.867 --> 41:11.033
Big thanks to Ram and Alyssa.

41:11.033 --> 41:14.000
You were both awesome.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.433
Congratulations
to our top three.

41:17.433 --> 41:20.800
Now the power is in the hands
of the audience.

41:20.800 --> 41:22.266
They will decide our winner.

41:22.266 --> 41:25.500
Audience,
pick up your voting device.

41:25.500 --> 41:27.066
