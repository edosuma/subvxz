WEBVTT

00:03.400 --> 00:06.500
[Grunting]

00:06.400 --> 00:09.100
[Mumbling]

00:16.300 --> 00:18.700
Kelso, what's with the gym shorts?

00:18.500 --> 00:23.300
Oh, something happened.
I had to take my pants off.

00:23.200 --> 00:25.400
Do you shave your legs?

00:27.400 --> 00:32.200
No. It's-
They're just... naturally smooth.

00:33.600 --> 00:35.900
Shut up!

00:35.800 --> 00:39.700
Not to worry, Kelso.
The Puberty Bunny will visit you soon.

00:41.100 --> 00:43.800
So, lab partner...

00:43.800 --> 00:47.100
I guess you and I are gonna be spending
a lot of time together now, huh?

00:46.900 --> 00:48.900
Yeah, Shelly.
And, uh, good thing too...

00:48.800 --> 00:51.400
'cause, you know, I just shouldn't be
alone around a Bunsen burner.

00:51.400 --> 00:55.200
[Laughing]
That is so funny!

00:55.200 --> 00:57.300
Let me go tell my friends
you're driving me home.

00:59.400 --> 01:02.400
Looks like Shelly
has a thing for Forman.

01:02.300 --> 01:05.400
Yes, and Forman
has a thing for Shelly.

01:05.400 --> 01:07.400
And it's in his pants.

01:09.400 --> 01:11.400
Oh, good one, Fez.

01:14.200 --> 01:17.700
Watch. Shelly's gonna invite you over
to her house when her folks aren't home.

01:17.600 --> 01:20.000
That's what slutty girls do.

01:20.000 --> 01:24.400
So, Eric, my parents aren't home.
Let's go to my house.

01:24.300 --> 01:27.500
- [Door Closes]
- Huh. Don't you have a girlfriend?

01:27.400 --> 01:29.400
Yeah. That's what's great about it.

01:29.300 --> 01:35.200
See, maybe Donna will get jealous
and her and Shelly will wrestle over you.

01:35.000 --> 01:39.800
- Kelso, that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
- Oh, yeah? Think about it.

01:46.100 --> 01:48.600
- He's mine!
- No, he's mine!

01:48.500 --> 01:51.900
- I had him first!
- You're going down!

02:14.500 --> 02:16.500
Kelso, that's the smartest thing
I've ever heard.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.800
Hangin'out

02:23.200 --> 02:25.200
Down the street

02:26.700 --> 02:28.800
The same old thing

02:30.400 --> 02:32.400
We did last week

02:33.500 --> 02:37.300
Not a thing to do

02:37.100 --> 02:40.500
But talk to you

02:40.500 --> 02:42.800
We're all all right

02:42.800 --> 02:44.800
We're all all right

02:44.800 --> 02:47.600
Hello, Wisconsin.!

02:52.200 --> 02:54.400
[Jukebox: Rock]

02:54.400 --> 02:57.600
Are you sure you don't
want to study at my house?

02:57.500 --> 03:00.800
I mean,
it's just sitting there all empty.

03:00.700 --> 03:02.900
No, come on,
this place was made-

03:02.800 --> 03:06.500
[Shouting]
This- this place was made for studying!

03:08.500 --> 03:11.000
Well, okay.

03:12.400 --> 03:14.600
- Hey, Eric.
- Hey, Shelly, look. It's my girlfriend, Donna.

03:14.600 --> 03:16.800
Hi, girlfriend Donna.

03:18.200 --> 03:20.300
Hi, Donna.

03:20.300 --> 03:24.300
You know, Eric, we'll do this later,
when we can be alone.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.300
To study.
We were just studying.

03:28.200 --> 03:32.100
- Eric, you got to hear this-
- We were just studying, Donna, that's all.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
Eric, I'm telling a story here.

03:34.900 --> 03:38.800
Kelso was running through the cafeteria and
there were these mashed potatoes on the floor-

03:38.700 --> 03:42.300
She's just my lab partner!
So, mellow out! God!

03:44.600 --> 03:46.900
Uh-huh. So, Kelso
slips on the potatoes...

03:46.900 --> 03:50.300
slides into a pole with his legs spread,
totally wracks himself.

03:50.200 --> 03:52.900
And everybody starts throwing
their carrots and their cheese at him...

03:52.900 --> 03:56.100
chanting-
"Tater nuts! Tater nuts!"

03:57.000 --> 03:59.200
It was awesome!

03:59.200 --> 04:04.500
So, wait. Even though I'm spending time
with Shelly, you're not jealous?

04:04.400 --> 04:08.500
[Chuckles]
I'm sorry, but you and Shelly?

04:10.900 --> 04:15.100
- What does that mean?
- It means that she can have anyone.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.500
And what does that mean?

04:18.300 --> 04:21.300
- Oh, you're sweet.
- Get off of me!

04:24.600 --> 04:26.500
Well, there's the little patient.

04:26.500 --> 04:29.300
So, how'd it go at the doctor's?

04:29.300 --> 04:31.600
Well, let me put it this way.

04:31.600 --> 04:35.400
If a horse is in good shape,
they say it's healthy as me.

04:36.700 --> 04:38.600
Uh-huh.

04:38.600 --> 04:43.400
And did they say something about
your pants being on fire, liar, liar?

04:45.500 --> 04:48.300
- No.
- I just got off the phone with Dr. Leggett.

04:48.300 --> 04:50.500
He said your blood pressure
is through the roof.

04:50.500 --> 04:53.600
Well, Kitty,
who are you gonna believe?

04:53.600 --> 04:59.100
Some quack doctor or the man who stood by
you while you delivered our children?

04:58.800 --> 05:01.800
Oh, you did not.
You went out for a sub.

05:04.700 --> 05:08.000
Red, from now on, I am going to
make sure you eat right.

05:07.900 --> 05:10.400
No meat, no cheese and no beer.

05:11.300 --> 05:14.300
No beer? You- Ohh!

05:14.200 --> 05:16.900
[Groaning]

05:16.800 --> 05:19.600
Oh, that's it, Kitty. Ohh!

05:19.600 --> 05:23.700
You've killed me.
[Groaning] I see the light.

05:25.000 --> 05:30.300
What's that, Lord? It's okay
to eat meat and beer and cheese?

05:30.200 --> 05:33.100
Okay, I'll- I'll tell her.

05:34.400 --> 05:39.600
What that's, Lord?
Dry toast and oatmeal. Will do.

05:41.900 --> 05:45.500
Man, Donna saw Shelly
practically living in my lap.

05:45.500 --> 05:47.600
How could she not be jealous?

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
I'm hot.

05:54.000 --> 05:58.500
It's because you are decent, good-hearted
and pure. You know, a sissy.

06:00.300 --> 06:05.100
Forman, I think what we need here
is some input from Tater Nuts.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.300
Tater Nuts, what do you think,
Tater Nuts?

06:09.600 --> 06:14.500
Eric, this-
Hey, stop calling me Tater Nuts!

06:16.100 --> 06:20.800
If Donna's not jealous, I mean,
it means, basically, you're in the free and clear.

06:20.700 --> 06:24.700
She's giving you the okay to cheat.
You gotta cheat!

06:25.400 --> 06:29.800
Hmm. Tater Nuts makes sense.

06:29.700 --> 06:31.700
[Kelso]
Quit it.!

06:33.900 --> 06:37.400
I mean, I could be with Shelly right now,
if I wanted to.

06:37.400 --> 06:41.000
So, why shouldn't I?

06:40.900 --> 06:44.200
Because then you will have two women
when some people have none!

06:46.900 --> 06:48.900
Forget it, Forman.
You're not a cheater.

06:48.900 --> 06:52.600
You know, a wise man once said,
"Know thyself."

06:52.600 --> 06:55.800
That man's name...
was Tater Nuts.

06:59.500 --> 07:05.000
I got to be honest with you, guys.
Okay, l- I do shave my legs.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.400
I just- I just like the way it feels.

07:10.900 --> 07:13.400
No! Come on now!

07:14.900 --> 07:18.100
Hey, Donna. Look, we're not gonna be able
to hang out tonight.

07:18.100 --> 07:20.200
I've got to go to the library with Shelly.

07:20.200 --> 07:22.300
Okay, that's cool. We can just
hang out tomorrow night.

07:22.200 --> 07:24.300
No, yeah, no.

07:24.200 --> 07:28.700
See, yeah, I'm gonna have my hands full
with this Project that's due in a few days...

07:28.600 --> 07:32.500
so I'll be off alone with Shelly.

07:33.700 --> 07:36.900
She doesn't wear a bra, you know.

07:37.800 --> 07:39.700
Yeah, whatever. Bye.

07:40.700 --> 07:43.700
Uh-oh. Farmhand got ahold
of the rich lady.

07:43.700 --> 07:47.100
- [Clears Throat]
- Oh, hi, kids.

07:47.100 --> 07:51.100
Your dad's not really a farmhand.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.500
Yeah. It's just a little intimacy game
we're playing.

07:53.500 --> 07:56.800
- And it's fun!
- Yeah. [Laughing]

07:59.700 --> 08:02.600
I'm sorry you had to see that.

08:02.500 --> 08:05.400
I'm sorry I had to see that.

08:05.400 --> 08:10.500
- Yeah, well, you know, Shelly's waiting for me. So-
- Yeah, Eric, you said that.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.800
Okay, bye.

08:16.700 --> 08:19.500
- He usually gives me a kiss good-bye.
- Yeah. To be honest?

08:19.400 --> 08:21.700
It kinda grosses me out.

08:21.600 --> 08:25.600
Wait, Jackie, should I be worried that
he's spending so much time with Shelly?

08:25.500 --> 08:30.500
Okay, well, normally I'd say yeah,
but Eric would never cheat on you.

08:30.400 --> 08:34.799
I mean, all guys cheat.
But I never really thought of Eric as a guy.

08:35.900 --> 08:39.600
Yeah, he's more like a-
like a really masculine girl.

08:42.400 --> 08:45.800
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, kind of like you.

08:50.500 --> 08:54.600
Mmm! Lookee, lookee, lookee.
Ribs, corn bread and baked beans.

08:54.500 --> 08:57.200
Come to Papa! Ow!

08:57.200 --> 08:59.500
Ooh, Papa been slapped.

09:01.300 --> 09:03.600
No, now- now that food
is for the kids.

09:03.600 --> 09:08.700
But, here, um, l-I boiled you
some skinless chicken.

09:10.900 --> 09:13.800
Ew! It's gray!

09:13.800 --> 09:18.400
- Laurie!
- I mean, it's gray, yea!

09:23.000 --> 09:25.500
Look, he's already home.

09:25.500 --> 09:28.900
I can't believe
I was so suspicious.

09:28.900 --> 09:33.400
He's such a good guy. I'm gonna write
him a note. A little, "I love you."

09:33.200 --> 09:35.800
[Giggles]

09:35.800 --> 09:38.300
You know, Michael
once wrote me a sexy note.

09:38.200 --> 09:42.400
Except, he can't really spell, so I didn't
know what I was supposed to do to him.

09:43.300 --> 09:45.300
[Gasps]

09:46.600 --> 09:49.000
Oh, my God!

09:48.900 --> 09:51.900
Donna, you should not leave
your panties in your boyfriend's car.

09:51.900 --> 09:55.500
- I didn't.
- Oh.

09:55.400 --> 09:57.400
Oh!

09:57.400 --> 09:59.400
Oh.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.200
- Is this your card?
- No.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.900
- Is this your card?
- No.

10:10.900 --> 10:13.600
- Is this your card?
- No.

10:13.600 --> 10:16.100
Ah, screw you.

10:18.200 --> 10:22.500
Hey, Kelso, I had a dream
about you last night.

10:22.300 --> 10:25.300
- Really?
- Yeah.

10:25.200 --> 10:29.600
We were doing stuff,
and it was all hot and sweaty...

10:29.400 --> 10:33.800
and I just kept calling
your name over and over.

10:33.700 --> 10:38.200
[Inhales]
"Tater Nuts! Tater Nuts!"

10:38.100 --> 10:41.500
[Laughing]

10:43.300 --> 10:45.900
Then what?

10:47.700 --> 10:51.800
Hey, Laurie, I found something in Eric's car
that I think must probably be yours.

10:51.600 --> 10:55.300
Is that-
Oh, good heavens, it is.

10:57.200 --> 11:00.000
I am in the presence of panties.

10:59.900 --> 11:03.500
[Choir Singing]

11:03.500 --> 11:07.500
- [Ends]
- Donna, please. I don't wear pink panties.

11:07.300 --> 11:10.000
Yeah. She'd have to wear panties
to wear pink panties.

11:12.700 --> 11:15.100
Hyde, did you have a girl
in Eric's car?

11:14.900 --> 11:18.400
No. Oh, but I did have
some nachos in there.

11:18.300 --> 11:22.600
And to mess with Forman, I smeared cheese
underneath the seat so it'd really stink.

11:22.500 --> 11:24.900
- Did it stink in there?
- Kind of.

11:24.800 --> 11:28.900
- All right!
- Well, then, whose are they?

11:28.700 --> 11:31.300
Hello? You have not asked me.

11:33.900 --> 11:36.900
Could they not be Fez's panties?

11:36.800 --> 11:40.800
I mean, is that so hard to imagine,
Fez in a car with a woman?

11:41.900 --> 11:45.100
- Whose could they be?
- [Murmuring, Indistinct]

11:45.100 --> 11:48.300
All right, Donna, here.
I'll figure this out.

11:48.100 --> 11:51.100
I like to think of myself
as the Columbo of panties.

11:52.600 --> 11:57.800
Yeah. I'd say we're looking at a woman.

11:59.000 --> 12:01.700
Ages 16 to 38...

12:01.700 --> 12:05.300
with a five-figure income.

12:05.200 --> 12:09.700
She lives within a four-mile radius of here
and is very popular with the gentlemen.

12:09.500 --> 12:12.500
Sure, she is. She'll have sex in a car
that stinks like cheese.

12:13.800 --> 12:16.200
So, what you're saying is,
they could be Shelly's.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.500
Come on.
Forman wouldn't cheat on Donna.

12:18.500 --> 12:22.000
Sure he would. Shelly's a tramp.
No man can turn down a tramp.

12:22.000 --> 12:25.000
Well, let's find out.
Laurie, have you ever been turned down?

12:27.500 --> 12:29.700
Nope.

12:29.700 --> 12:31.700
Oh. Sorry, Donna.

12:33.200 --> 12:37.500
Don't feel sorry for me. Feel sorry for Eric.
'Cause I'm gonna kill him!

12:38.800 --> 12:41.800
Will somebody please open the door
so I can kill Eric?

12:57.300 --> 12:59.500
Hey, there, Red.

13:01.800 --> 13:06.100
Does Mrs. Forman know you're out here
clogging your arteries with a double cheese?

13:07.000 --> 13:09.200
Yes.

13:10.400 --> 13:15.400
So there would be...
no reason to tell her.

13:15.300 --> 13:19.200
Sorry, Red. I don't think
I could lie to Mrs. Forman.

13:19.100 --> 13:21.100
'Cause I really, really love her.

13:23.300 --> 13:26.700
All right, you blackmailing S.O.B.,
what do you want?

13:26.600 --> 13:29.100
Sure could use some fries.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.900
Here. Now beat it.

13:30.900 --> 13:33.200
You don't have to be rude.

13:35.900 --> 13:37.900
What if this wasn't even the first time?

13:37.800 --> 13:41.100
What if there have been other girls?
Other panties?

13:53.700 --> 13:56.800
Eric, where did these panties come from?

13:56.800 --> 13:59.800
Uh, gee, I don't know.

13:59.600 --> 14:02.300
But there's nothing in the dresser.
Nothing at all.

14:15.900 --> 14:21.700
Okay, but at least my closet is panty-free.
Donna, you have my word.

14:28.100 --> 14:31.400
Okay, Donna, please, ignore the rope
in the middle of the room.

14:31.400 --> 14:35.000
And whatever you do,
don't Pull it.!

14:48.200 --> 14:51.300
Eric, how do you exPlain all this?

14:51.200 --> 14:54.900
Panties!
Glorious panties!

14:54.900 --> 14:58.100
[Laughing]

15:05.800 --> 15:08.300
Bastard!

15:08.300 --> 15:12.300
- Hey, there, Donna. Where are you going?
- To The Hub to kick Eric's ass!

15:12.200 --> 15:16.300
Yeah, well, kick it good.

15:16.100 --> 15:19.300
Jackie, why is Donna
gonna beat up Eric?

15:19.200 --> 15:22.000
Donna found another woman's panties
in the Vista Cruiser.

15:21.900 --> 15:25.500
- [Gasps] Oh, no!
- I know, right. Eric's cheating on her.

15:26.700 --> 15:30.200
Jackie, those panties were mine.

15:31.800 --> 15:34.600
You and Eric?

15:35.800 --> 15:38.200
No! Me and-

15:39.300 --> 15:41.500
Geez, you're dumb.

15:43.700 --> 15:47.700
Now, remember, we can't have the protons
and electrons right next to each other...

15:47.500 --> 15:50.000
because that would
just be madness.

15:50.000 --> 15:52.300
Madness, I say!

15:52.200 --> 15:57.800
Oh, Eric Forman, you are just
the funniest person I've ever met.

15:57.600 --> 16:01.900
No, I wouldn't go as-
Yes. Yes, I am.

16:01.800 --> 16:05.500
Doesn't your girlfriend mind
you spending so much time with me?

16:05.500 --> 16:08.700
Well, no.
Apparently, she's thrilled about it.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.500
Well, she's crazy.

16:10.400 --> 16:14.400
'Cause if I was your girlfriend,
I would want to kiss you all the time.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.400
Really?

16:19.700 --> 16:23.200
Whoa! Hey, come on, lady!
I'm spoken for!

16:25.300 --> 16:27.700
Wow!

16:28.600 --> 16:30.600
Hey, did we miss anything?

16:30.600 --> 16:32.500
What? God, no.
You didn't miss anything.

16:32.400 --> 16:37.300
All right, people! Let's back up!
Give 'em some room here!

16:41.600 --> 16:43.600
Hey, Donna, hi, hello.

16:43.500 --> 16:46.300
Don't "Hey, Donna, hi, hello" me.

16:46.300 --> 16:49.000
I trusted you,
and you cheated on me with this slut.

16:48.900 --> 16:51.000
- Uh, Donna, I don't-
- Excuse me?

16:51.000 --> 16:53.700
Yeah, I said it.
You want some of this? Come on!

16:55.000 --> 16:57.300
- Donna, hey, whatever you think happened-
- I know what happened.

16:57.300 --> 17:00.800
- I found these in your car.
- Panties?

17:00.700 --> 17:03.100
Aha! So he admits they are panties.

17:04.500 --> 17:07.000
Hey, next time you fool around
with someone else's boyfriend...

17:07.000 --> 17:09.000
why don't you take your panties
when you're done?

17:09.000 --> 17:12.900
Those aren't mine.
Mine are white. And cotton.

17:12.900 --> 17:16.300
With a little pink rose in the front.

17:23.700 --> 17:25.599
So these are some
other girl's panties?

17:25.599 --> 17:29.000
Whoa, whoa! No offense, Donna,
but, dude, you're on fire!

17:31.600 --> 17:33.600
You know what, Eric?
I don't need this.

17:33.600 --> 17:39.400
Oh, and by the way,
your car smells like cheese.

17:42.700 --> 17:46.100
Donna, look, you have to believe me.
I have no idea whose panties those are.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.700
Donna, those panties are mine.

17:48.600 --> 17:53.600
Eric! Ohh! Ohh!

17:53.500 --> 17:56.200
You are a god!

18:01.600 --> 18:04.400
A god, I say!

18:08.000 --> 18:11.700
Um...
[Clears Throat] Mom...

18:11.600 --> 18:14.200
why were your panties
in the Vista Cruiser?

18:15.100 --> 18:17.700
And please be as specific.

18:20.000 --> 18:23.300
Donna, when you've been together
as long as your father and I have...

18:23.200 --> 18:26.900
you need to do creative things
in creative places.

18:26.800 --> 18:30.100
- Ew!
- Ohh! Gads!

18:45.900 --> 18:49.200
Psst. Daddy, here.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.700
Red, you eating again? I thought
you'd be full after that burger.

18:58.000 --> 19:01.500
- Burger?
- Yeah. The broccoli burger.

19:04.100 --> 19:06.700
Oh, you are lying!

19:07.800 --> 19:09.700
Well, come on, Kitty.

19:09.800 --> 19:14.300
This isn't food.
This is what food eats.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.400
Well, but it's good for you.

19:17.400 --> 19:20.600
Well, if it's so good, how come
I'm the only one that has to eat it?

19:21.500 --> 19:23.500
Good point.

19:23.500 --> 19:26.300
Hey, he's the food sneaker!

19:34.900 --> 19:40.700
- Eat up!
- You wanna mess with me again?
You just come on back.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.800
- Say it again.
- I already said it.

19:48.800 --> 19:51.400
- Come on, one more time.
- You're hot.

19:51.300 --> 19:53.700
[Chuckles]

19:53.600 --> 19:56.600
- Hot enough to get Shelly?
- Hot enough to get Shelly.

19:56.600 --> 20:00.400
- Hot enough to get any girl I want?
- Hot enough to get Shelly.

20:01.600 --> 20:05.700
Yeah. That's just good stuff.

20:05.600 --> 20:09.800
You know, Eric, you don't have to rub it in.
I know I made an ass out of myself.

20:09.600 --> 20:14.500
Well, you know what?
That's what you get for taking me for granted.

20:14.400 --> 20:18.100
'Cause, Donna, I may be skinny, but-

20:18.000 --> 20:22.300
Yeah, I'm MickJagger skinny and that's
very in right now. Yeah, it's very hot.

20:22.100 --> 20:26.300
Eric, I know you're hot,
'cause you're with me.

20:31.800 --> 20:35.100
Okay. So, what have
we learned from all this?

20:34.900 --> 20:37.100
- Always lock the doors to the Vista Cruiser.
- Right you are.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.700
Man, Bob and Midge
must really hate me.

20:44.700 --> 20:49.500
'Cause right after having sex in my car,
I think they smeared cheese under the seat.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.800
That's just mean.

20:51.600 --> 20:55.000
There. Okay, I think it's safe
for human occupancy again.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.600
Uh-oh.

20:57.600 --> 21:00.400
Looks like Bob left something
in the car too.

21:03.300 --> 21:06.200
Eric, you must sell this car.

21:06.200 --> 21:08.200
Or call a priest.
