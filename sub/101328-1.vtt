00:03.732 --> 00:05.296
(eerie music)

00:05.296 --> 00:08.898
(electricity crackling)

00:08.898 --> 00:10.760
(clicks)

00:10.760 --> 00:13.260
(eerie music)

00:28.148 --> 00:29.610
-  Put this kid on your radar,

00:29.610 --> 00:32.950
because I guarantee
you, he's going places.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.410
-  Call him what you will,

00:34.410 --> 00:36.493
everyone's talking about this guy.

00:36.493 --> 00:39.157
He's been labeled as a genius,

00:39.157 --> 00:40.050
a prodigy, a mastermind.
- Only one took home

00:40.050 --> 00:41.920
the coveted first prize award

00:41.920 --> 00:44.440
at this year's sci-tech Computer-Con,

00:44.440 --> 00:46.970
and that lucky person was teenage phenom,

00:46.970 --> 00:49.050
Atticus Virtue, for creating

00:49.050 --> 00:50.810
his very own robot.
- Atticus Virtue has already

00:50.810 --> 00:52.368
committed to MIT with

00:52.368 --> 00:53.410
a full-ride scholarship.
- Become the youngest recruit

00:53.410 --> 00:54.740
in the school storied history.

00:54.740 --> 00:56.700
- Virtue Inc. went public today

00:56.700 --> 00:58.880
with stocks trading for the first time.

00:58.880 --> 01:01.080
Valuations are soaring into space,

01:01.080 --> 01:02.540
like one of its rocket ships.

01:02.540 --> 01:05.480
-  Atticus Virtue connect
billionaire to his resume.

01:05.480 --> 01:07.730
-  But he's also
connecting the country

01:07.730 --> 01:09.230
with his high-speed bullet train.

01:09.230 --> 01:10.960
-  His outstanding achievements

01:10.960 --> 01:14.470
in the computer sciences have
become front and center--

01:14.470 --> 01:16.410
- Later today, he will oversee the launch

01:16.410 --> 01:18.473
of his manned spaceflight to Mars.

01:19.311 --> 01:21.450
-  The guy is
living the ultimate life.

01:21.450 --> 01:22.343
He's rich, he's famous--
- But you know what they say

01:22.343 --> 01:23.800
about him, right?

01:23.800 --> 01:25.477
Guys wanna be Atticus Virtue

01:25.477 --> 01:27.430
and girls wanna be Atticus Virtue.

01:27.430 --> 01:29.220
-  Check this
out, Northwest Arkansas,

01:29.220 --> 01:30.400
Bentonville High's brand new

01:30.400 --> 01:32.320
athletic facility opens today.

01:32.320 --> 01:33.980
-  That's right, wow, all courtesy

01:33.980 --> 01:36.300
of hometown hero, Atticus Virtue.

01:36.300 --> 01:38.234
Look at that.
- So cool.

01:38.234 --> 01:39.470
- And there's some
shakeups within the company

01:39.470 --> 01:41.240
over the last five years.

01:41.240 --> 01:43.350
Things have been fairly
quiet for Atticus Virtue

01:43.350 --> 01:44.530
and his tech company.

01:44.530 --> 01:46.600
Some saying he's ready to retire.

01:46.600 --> 01:49.840
Other insiders speculating
that he is working on something

01:49.840 --> 01:52.600
so top secret, so groundbreaking

01:52.600 --> 01:56.064
that it's going to change
reality as we know it.

01:56.064 --> 02:00.623
- Haven.
(intense music)

02:05.705 --> 02:07.965
(dog barking)

02:07.965 --> 02:11.165
(tense music)

02:11.165 --> 02:14.082
(keyboard tapping)

02:23.397 --> 02:26.147
(computer beeps)

02:29.390 --> 02:31.640
(bag zips)

02:33.550 --> 02:36.140
-  I should hopefully
see you guys after school,

02:36.140 --> 02:37.880
as long as they don't make
me work a double again.

02:37.880 --> 02:39.660
- So we just gave up on the idea

02:39.660 --> 02:40.493
of dad sending money ever again?

02:40.493 --> 02:41.940
- We don't need money from your father.

02:41.940 --> 02:43.130
- You know there's this
thing called karma,

02:43.130 --> 02:44.660
and one day it's gonna catch up to him.

02:44.660 --> 02:46.590
I'm just gonna laugh in his face.

02:46.590 --> 02:48.390
Seriously, mom, just give me 10 minutes,

02:48.390 --> 02:49.930
and I can hack into this
credit card's website,

02:49.930 --> 02:51.100
and make the late fee disappear.

02:51.100 --> 02:52.890
- I know you can.

02:52.890 --> 02:55.420
But, sweetie, that's called stealing.

02:55.420 --> 02:57.320
- Yeah, they're stealing from us.

02:57.320 --> 02:59.200
- Your brother's gonna
freeze to death outside.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.503
Now go!
- Okay.

03:03.215 --> 03:05.226
(tense music)

03:05.226 --> 03:07.190
(door opens and creaks)
Get up, Sparky.

03:07.190 --> 03:08.590
- What took you so long?

03:08.590 --> 03:10.310
- Oh nothing, I was just hacking

03:10.310 --> 03:12.920
into all the Smart Doorbell
systems in the neighborhood.

03:12.920 --> 03:16.510
- I have so many questions,
but mainly just why?

03:16.510 --> 03:18.325
- Okay, check it out.

03:18.325 --> 03:21.430
(keypad typing)

03:21.430 --> 03:24.244
(phone beeping)

03:24.244 --> 03:28.907
Okay.
(doorbell rings)

03:28.907 --> 03:31.324
(door opens)

03:33.651 --> 03:34.977
(door closes)
-  Wow.

03:34.977 --> 03:35.810
- Mm-hmm.

03:35.810 --> 03:38.280
- And you wonder why you have no friends,

03:38.280 --> 03:40.970
no job, no life, no boyfriend--

03:40.970 --> 03:42.720
- And no cares in the world, Ethan.

03:45.089 --> 03:48.256
(upbeat lively music)

03:53.698 --> 03:55.080
- All right, I'll be right
here to pick you up, sweetie.

03:55.080 --> 03:56.030
- Thanks, dad, love you.

03:56.030 --> 03:57.213
- I love you, too.

03:57.213 --> 03:59.377
♪ Could somebody wake me up ♪

03:59.377 --> 04:01.402
♪ You seem like a dream ♪

04:01.402 --> 04:03.756
♪ I'm holding my breath because ♪

04:03.756 --> 04:05.173
- Move your hand.

04:06.050 --> 04:07.160
No, the other hand.

04:07.160 --> 04:08.203
- Oh, like this?

04:09.140 --> 04:11.160
- No, mom, I'm trying to
see the fancy dashboard.

04:11.160 --> 04:13.191
- Oh, sorry, I thought
you wanted me in it.

04:13.191 --> 04:14.691
- Very funny, mom.

04:16.530 --> 04:17.730
(camera snaps)

04:17.730 --> 04:18.730
Mm, perfect.

04:19.580 --> 04:22.000
This should get like
20,000 likes before lunch.

04:22.000 --> 04:23.893
- I am so proud of you, honey.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.420
Potatoes.

04:26.420 --> 04:27.813
-  French fries.

04:31.370 --> 04:32.203
- Bye mom.

04:33.386 --> 04:34.219
Hey, watch it, freak.

04:34.219 --> 04:37.029
- Oh, look I'm Internet famous.

04:37.029 --> 04:38.320
Move!

04:38.320 --> 04:39.390
- Hey!
- What?

04:39.390 --> 04:40.893
- Don't.
- Back up.

04:41.770 --> 04:44.933
- Do you think we're doomed as a species?

04:52.900 --> 04:55.811
- What, I'm sorry, what
were you talking about?

04:55.811 --> 04:58.130
- I said don't you think Connor Lawson's

04:58.130 --> 05:00.260
a little out of your league?

05:00.260 --> 05:01.422
- What?

05:01.422 --> 05:04.343
What do you, just, ah, you're so annoying.

05:05.199 --> 05:06.570
(whistle blows)

05:06.570 --> 05:08.320
- I know it must feel very weird

05:08.320 --> 05:11.140
for you to be moving
your legs around so much.

05:11.140 --> 05:12.543
But that's called jogging.

05:13.988 --> 05:17.123
And that weird shiny
stuff is called sweat.

05:19.102 --> 05:20.140
(whistle blows)

05:20.140 --> 05:21.980
Stretch it out.

05:21.980 --> 05:23.580
What are you doing on the bench?

05:27.230 --> 05:29.060
- What are you talking about, playa?

05:29.060 --> 05:30.730
- Benny, we talked about this.

05:30.730 --> 05:33.210
You can't call me playa anymore.

05:33.210 --> 05:35.610
And what's wrong with you this week?

05:35.610 --> 05:37.300
- Tendinitis.

05:37.300 --> 05:38.810
I got a note from my mom.

05:38.810 --> 05:41.700
- How many hours of Fortify
do you play every day?

05:41.700 --> 05:43.000
- Enough to be the best.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.600
- Enough to give you tendinitis?

05:46.290 --> 05:49.250
- Let's just say, enough
to get a note from my mom

05:49.250 --> 05:53.023
so I don't have to jog and
sweat around the gym, playa.

05:54.180 --> 05:57.352
(Benny scoffs)

05:57.352 --> 05:59.450
(whistle blows)

05:59.450 --> 06:01.140
Playa, playa.

06:01.140 --> 06:03.670
- And I have found to no surprise

06:03.670 --> 06:07.360
that the future of me is in my posts,

06:07.360 --> 06:10.883
my thoughts, and in my eyes.

06:12.420 --> 06:13.253
Thank you.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.480
- Well, now that was an interesting choice

06:16.480 --> 06:18.180
for a poem, Sophia.

06:18.180 --> 06:20.750
- It was called Sophia.

06:20.750 --> 06:21.720
- And it was very clear.

06:21.720 --> 06:22.733
Thank you, Sophia.

06:24.020 --> 06:25.993
Max Winslow, you're up.

06:32.610 --> 06:36.053
- So anyway here's my poem.

06:39.170 --> 06:40.786
- Well, Max, that's not poem.

06:40.786 --> 06:43.119
It's, that's just gibberish.

06:44.340 --> 06:45.804
- It's a firewall code.

06:45.804 --> 06:47.200
-  A what code?

06:47.200 --> 06:48.970
- A firewall code.

06:48.970 --> 06:51.137
And in my opinion it's better than a poem,

06:51.137 --> 06:54.000
'cause it serves an actual purpose.

06:54.000 --> 06:55.680
This one keeps bad things out,

06:55.680 --> 06:58.300
so if you delete any of the
letters or numbers in the code

06:58.300 --> 07:00.040
then the whole thing falls apart.

07:00.040 --> 07:02.700
It doesn't work unless
everything works together.

07:02.700 --> 07:05.653
So, yeah, and that's pretty poetic.

07:07.176 --> 07:08.367
(door shuts)

07:08.367 --> 07:10.867
(tense music)

07:16.830 --> 07:19.710
- Hello, students of
Bentonville High School.

07:19.710 --> 07:20.790
I'm Atticus Virtue.

07:20.790 --> 07:23.503
But I'm guessing you already know that.

07:24.980 --> 07:28.360
As many of you know, I constructed
The Virtue Manor in 2009

07:28.360 --> 07:31.173
in order to conduct some very
cutting edge experiments.

07:32.140 --> 07:37.140
My goal has always been to
build a better tomorrow,

07:37.230 --> 07:39.080
to bring the future into the present.

07:40.360 --> 07:43.815
Well, I am pleased to announce

07:43.815 --> 07:46.510
that my experiments have been a success.

07:46.510 --> 07:47.810
That's right.

07:47.810 --> 07:49.730
Long before my little startup

07:49.730 --> 07:52.630
turned into the billion dollar
tech company it is today,

07:52.630 --> 07:54.933
I grew up in Northwest Arkansas.

07:56.400 --> 07:57.893
I'm proud of my humble roots.

07:59.010 --> 08:01.080
I'm proud to have attended
the same high school

08:01.080 --> 08:03.163
that you are all sitting at today.

08:04.955 --> 08:06.813
And that is why I wanna
give back to my community.

08:07.850 --> 08:12.533
So I am conducting one final
experimental competition.

08:13.520 --> 08:15.773
Exactly five students will be chosen,

08:16.730 --> 08:19.550
be invited to my home here.

08:19.550 --> 08:22.455
Those five students
will compete in a game.

08:22.455 --> 08:23.960
The winner of that game

08:26.356 --> 08:27.673
will get the key to my manor.

08:30.047 --> 08:31.373
It is really that simple.

08:32.790 --> 08:37.278
So the school bell will ring
at 3 p.m., at 3:16 on the dot

08:37.278 --> 08:38.330
and you all will receive a text.

08:38.330 --> 08:40.080
Five of you will be chosen, got it?

08:41.850 --> 08:42.683
Benediximus.

08:43.930 --> 08:45.433
That's Latin.

08:45.433 --> 08:46.363
Good luck.

08:48.370 --> 08:50.653
(bell rings)

08:50.653 --> 08:53.736
(enlightening music)

08:56.947 --> 08:58.640
-  Yeah, that dude's
like a total hermit now.

08:58.640 --> 09:00.825
-  Yeah, but he's worth 32 billion.

09:00.825 --> 09:03.909
-  I would die if I got
to go to that thing tonight.

09:03.909 --> 09:06.022
(enlightening music)

09:06.022 --> 09:08.772
(phones beeping)

09:25.336 --> 09:27.662
(sighs)

09:27.662 --> 09:30.412
(phones beeping)

09:34.810 --> 09:36.989
- No way, I got invited.

09:36.989 --> 09:38.920
- No, you didn't.
- No, you didn't.

09:38.920 --> 09:41.205
- Bro, no way (chuckles).

09:41.205 --> 09:42.490
(phone dings)
(screams)

09:42.490 --> 09:45.873
- Oh my gosh, my Instagram
followers are gonna love this.

09:45.873 --> 09:47.890
I should, I could do a live stream.

09:47.890 --> 09:49.908
I have to tell my mom.

09:49.908 --> 09:52.408
(phone beeps)

09:54.001 --> 09:55.437
- Yes.

09:55.437 --> 09:56.854
No, what is this?

09:58.367 --> 10:01.373
- Mom, you are not gonna believe
what just happened to me.

10:06.380 --> 10:08.350
-  Wait, Maxine!

10:08.350 --> 10:10.170
Sorry, I mean Max.

10:10.170 --> 10:11.630
Did you see this thing?

10:11.630 --> 10:13.390
-  Yeah, I did, obviously.

10:13.390 --> 10:15.730
-  So I guess you
got a note then, too?

10:15.730 --> 10:17.614
-  I didn't even look at it.

10:17.614 --> 10:20.100
- You, you didn't even check your phone?

10:20.100 --> 10:22.480
- There are 3,000 kids
in that high school,

10:22.480 --> 10:24.210
only five are getting chosen,

10:24.210 --> 10:25.973
do you even know what those odds are?

10:27.870 --> 10:29.850
- No, stop trying to do
the math in your head.

10:29.850 --> 10:32.760
It's a 0.167% chance.

10:32.760 --> 10:35.160
- Did you really just do
that math in your head?

10:36.050 --> 10:37.810
Is that common core?

10:37.810 --> 10:38.873
- Listen, Ethan.

10:40.000 --> 10:42.930
Do I wanna go to Atticus Virtue's mansion?

10:42.930 --> 10:44.210
Of course I do.

10:44.210 --> 10:46.083
- Here, just let me look for you.

10:47.830 --> 10:50.023
- Okay, if it'll make you stop.

10:57.960 --> 10:59.830
- No.
- See?

10:59.830 --> 11:00.843
- Way.
- What?

11:02.540 --> 11:04.050
- No way.

11:04.050 --> 11:06.160
You got invited to Atticus Virtue's

11:06.160 --> 11:07.893
weird mansion party thing.

11:09.270 --> 11:10.293
- No way.

11:12.740 --> 11:13.573
Dude, yes!

11:15.368 --> 11:16.201
Come on!

11:18.090 --> 11:19.680
- He's launched rockets into space,

11:19.680 --> 11:21.320
redefined artificial intelligence,

11:21.320 --> 11:23.470
and now eccentric
billionaire, Atticus Virtue,

11:23.470 --> 11:25.630
takes on his next project--
- Nice.

11:25.630 --> 11:27.240
- A competition for high school students.

11:27.240 --> 11:28.400
- Oh, that's right, Jason.

11:28.400 --> 11:31.750
But no one knows much
about the Virtue estate,

11:31.750 --> 11:34.990
but apparently one lucky
student gets to keep it?

11:34.990 --> 11:35.850
- Yeah.

11:35.850 --> 11:38.430
I'm a student, I graduated
Bentonville class of '97,

11:38.430 --> 11:39.680
where's my invite?
(Jacklyn laughs)

11:39.680 --> 11:41.272
- You didn't get one.
- What, did you?

11:41.272 --> 11:42.105
- Neither did I, no.

11:42.105 --> 11:44.590
- Okay, wait a minute, how does the school

11:44.590 --> 11:47.203
just let him take over
the whole TV system?

11:48.310 --> 11:49.890
- Reason number one,
because he bought the school

11:49.890 --> 11:52.740
a $40 million athletic facility.

11:52.740 --> 11:53.573
- I know that.

11:53.573 --> 11:55.220
- Mom, Atticus Virtue is one of the most

11:55.220 --> 11:56.790
brilliant minds of our time.

11:56.790 --> 11:58.280
- I know that, too.

11:58.280 --> 12:00.803
It's weird though, right?

12:01.770 --> 12:03.520
It's a little bit of an unknown.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.340
- The world is an unknown.

12:05.340 --> 12:08.450
The Internet is the Wild West,

12:08.450 --> 12:12.053
and parents just send us
online willy nilly every day.

12:13.020 --> 12:17.470
This competition could
change our lives, ladies.

12:17.470 --> 12:18.630
It's game time.

12:18.630 --> 12:20.580
Let's go.

12:20.580 --> 12:21.880
- Why are you so riled up?

12:23.080 --> 12:24.490
Did you drink coffee again?

12:24.490 --> 12:26.173
- It was decaf.

12:28.650 --> 12:31.300
- What do you really want
me to say to you right now?

12:32.870 --> 12:35.640
- I want you to say that I got this.

12:35.640 --> 12:38.130
That maybe there's a reason I was chosen.

12:38.130 --> 12:41.790
- Max is like Neo from the Matrix

12:41.790 --> 12:45.760
except she's from the Arkansas.

12:45.760 --> 12:48.113
- Okay, you need to stop talking so much.

12:49.050 --> 12:51.790
- Mom, I have a one in five
chance of winning a mansion.

12:51.790 --> 12:54.220
We would be insane not to give it a try.

12:54.220 --> 12:56.457
I mean, look at us here.

12:56.457 --> 12:58.730
- Yeah, I mean look at us here.

12:58.730 --> 13:01.525
- Okay, you seriously have
to stop drinking coffee.

13:01.525 --> 13:04.530
- It's, it's decaf.

13:04.530 --> 13:09.503
- And you have to text me every hour.

13:09.503 --> 13:13.336

That's when you know you're important.

13:36.520 --> 13:38.200
- Did you already open it?

13:38.200 --> 13:39.740
- I maybe peeked a little bit.

13:39.740 --> 13:41.310
-  Doesn't change what's inside.

13:41.310 --> 13:43.040
- Full ride.

13:43.040 --> 13:46.040
The Con-Man's going Ivy League, baby.

13:46.040 --> 13:47.290

13:55.805 --> 13:56.638

13:58.523 --> 14:00.473

15:05.870 --> 15:06.743
- Pretty much.

15:07.890 --> 15:10.990
Hey, you should really cash
in on your popularity too.

15:10.990 --> 15:12.420
- That's not really my thing.

15:12.420 --> 15:13.920
- Oh, we get it.

15:13.920 --> 15:16.720
Lax Bro's too cool for social media.

15:16.720 --> 15:19.683
- Yeah, I once went 38 hours
straight without stopping play.

15:21.460 --> 15:23.900
Do you guys think they'll
have VR games there?

15:23.900 --> 15:25.507
- The mansion's supposed
to be super tech'd out.

15:25.507 --> 15:28.810
And I heard they got a private
drone, a robotic butler--

15:28.810 --> 15:31.140
- I heard that they used to do experiments

15:31.140 --> 15:32.727
on humans up there.

15:32.727 --> 15:35.227
(tense music)

15:36.630 --> 15:38.180
You guys don't know about this?

15:39.020 --> 15:40.100
There's a whole Reddit thread

15:40.100 --> 15:42.100
about how the mansion has a brain,

15:42.100 --> 15:45.760
and anyone who enters, it
gets inside of your brain

15:45.760 --> 15:47.083
and messes you up.

15:49.810 --> 15:51.070
- Yeah, that thread also mentions

15:51.070 --> 15:53.530
that the mansion has 64
yottabytes of memory,

15:53.530 --> 15:56.350
which I think is like really cool.

15:56.350 --> 15:58.280
- Wait, what is a yottabyte?

15:58.280 --> 15:59.550
- Gigabyte, Terabyte, Petabyte,

15:59.550 --> 16:01.450
Exabyte, Zettabyte, Yottabyte.

16:01.450 --> 16:03.473
It's a one with 24 zeroes behind it.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.713
It's like the T-Rex of memory.

16:07.840 --> 16:09.820
- Did it hurt?
- What?

16:09.820 --> 16:11.390
- When you tripped out of the nerd store?

16:11.390 --> 16:13.260
- Dude.
- What?

16:13.260 --> 16:14.800
She doesn't care.

16:14.800 --> 16:15.633
Look at her.

16:17.350 --> 16:19.820
Sorry, but you guys aren't my friends.

16:19.820 --> 16:22.493
As soon as we get to
this place we're enemies.

16:23.460 --> 16:25.790
Only one of us is
getting that key tonight.

16:25.790 --> 16:27.230
Don't forget it.

16:27.230 --> 16:30.313
(enlightening music)

16:57.403 --> 17:00.320
- Well, let's go ring the doorbell.

17:12.100 --> 17:12.933
(bangs door)

17:12.933 --> 17:16.238
- Yo, we're here, open up.

17:16.238 --> 17:19.905
(electronic door whirring)

17:21.257 --> 17:23.757
(tense music)

17:25.930 --> 17:26.763
- Hello?

17:28.200 --> 17:29.433
- That was kinda freaky.

17:30.270 --> 17:33.563
- Okay, you guys, I think we're
supposed to go inside now.

17:36.020 --> 17:37.553
What, don't be all Judge Judy.

17:43.258 --> 17:44.720
-  Whoa.

17:44.720 --> 17:48.123
- Okay, guys, we just entered the house.

17:54.030 --> 17:55.933
- Man, these decorations are whack.

17:56.926 --> 17:59.426
(tense music)

18:06.630 --> 18:08.760
-  Greetings, Conner, Aiden,

18:08.760 --> 18:11.830
Benny, Sophia and Maxine.

18:11.830 --> 18:12.700
- Who said that?

18:12.700 --> 18:15.480
-  I did, welcome to Virtue Manor.

18:15.480 --> 18:16.313
- Is it just me or does it sound

18:16.313 --> 18:17.820
like this dang house is talking?

18:17.820 --> 18:21.140
-  It is you, but
it also a house talking.

18:21.140 --> 18:23.920
Both statements are
factually correct, Benny.

18:23.920 --> 18:25.160
- Who are you?

18:25.160 --> 18:27.810
-  I am H-A-V-E-N.

18:27.810 --> 18:31.400
Home Automated Venture:
the house of tomorrow.

18:31.400 --> 18:33.230
But you can call me Haven.

18:33.230 --> 18:34.110
- What do you do?

18:34.110 --> 18:36.350
-  I control
everything in the house.

18:36.350 --> 18:40.970
Mr. Virtue said in 10 years
every home will have a Haven.

18:40.970 --> 18:42.480
- Where is Mr. Virtue?

18:42.480 --> 18:44.207
-  He'll be here soon.

18:44.207 --> 18:45.670
Are you hungry?

18:45.670 --> 18:47.020
I ordered food.

18:47.020 --> 18:51.000
It should be here in
five, four, three, two--

18:51.000 --> 18:53.066
(knocking on door)

18:53.066 --> 18:55.850
(electronic door whirring)

18:55.850 --> 18:59.970
- Um, I have an order for Haven?

18:59.970 --> 19:01.640
-  You went the wrong way.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.310
Had you taken Winchester

19:03.310 --> 19:04.880
you would've missed that construction

19:04.880 --> 19:06.820
and been here seven minutes ago.

19:06.820 --> 19:07.900
- Sorry?

19:07.900 --> 19:09.360
-  I should've
already had this food

19:09.360 --> 19:11.013
placed for my guests.

19:12.100 --> 19:15.782
Sir Mordred, get the food
from this lady, please?

19:15.782 --> 19:18.282
(tense music)

19:20.993 --> 19:22.193
- I'll take that.

19:30.373 --> 19:32.836
I hope you guys are hungry.

19:32.836 --> 19:33.750
- Who the heck are you, man?

19:33.750 --> 19:35.380
- I'm Sir Mordred.

19:35.380 --> 19:38.350
Mr. Virtue built me while he was at MIT.

19:38.350 --> 19:42.040
I am his oldest friend and
protector of his manor.

19:42.040 --> 19:43.183
- Are you like a robot?

19:45.354 --> 19:49.570
(sword slashes)
(fly buzzes)

19:49.570 --> 19:51.793
- Yes, I am an artificial life form.

19:53.859 --> 19:57.442
(graceful classical music)

20:39.370 --> 20:42.130
-  I hope the food is
pleasing to your palettes.

20:42.130 --> 20:44.287
- Mm-hmm, is there like a waitress here,

20:44.287 --> 20:47.860
'cause I wouldn't mind some of
that rich people mayonnaise.

20:47.860 --> 20:48.870
Aioli.

20:48.870 --> 20:50.020
- It's aioli.

20:50.020 --> 20:51.150
-  Please hold.

20:51.150 --> 20:52.400
We have an incoming call.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.083
- Well, hello there.

20:56.950 --> 20:59.110
I hope you're all enjoying the house,

20:59.110 --> 21:02.640
as it will soon belong to one of you.

21:02.640 --> 21:04.100
Wow.

21:04.100 --> 21:06.600
As you can see I'm not
much for decorating,

21:06.600 --> 21:08.800
but I almost passed out from
blowing up all these balloons

21:08.800 --> 21:10.440
so please enjoy them.

21:10.440 --> 21:12.640
- Mr. Virtue, where are you?

21:12.640 --> 21:15.700
- Currently, I am in my
jet flying over Tulsa.

21:15.700 --> 21:16.910
I had a work emergency,

21:16.910 --> 21:19.490
but I'm flying back there as we speak.

21:19.490 --> 21:20.670
Next question.

21:20.670 --> 21:22.100
- When does the game start?

21:22.100 --> 21:24.633
- The game will start
when the game starts.

21:25.710 --> 21:27.467
- Thanks, Captain Obvious.

21:27.467 --> 21:29.490
(Atticus chuckles)

21:29.490 --> 21:33.030
- Now, make sure you save
some room for dessert.

21:33.030 --> 21:34.980
We have a whole spread in the media room

21:34.980 --> 21:37.000
with Gummy Bears, Jelly Beans, chocolates

21:37.000 --> 21:39.483
so you eat till your heart's content.

21:41.440 --> 21:42.890
All right, it looks like we're
losing our connection here,

21:42.890 --> 21:44.490
so I'm gonna jump off.

21:44.490 --> 21:46.213
I will see you kids in a flash.

21:49.420 --> 21:52.390
- Okay, he's way more
down-to-earth than I thought.

21:52.390 --> 21:54.540
- Dude, he just hologrammed
himself in from a private jet,

21:54.540 --> 21:56.015
that's normal to you?

21:56.015 --> 21:57.860
(bottle thuds)

21:57.860 --> 22:00.669
- We don't have aioli.

23:25.990 --> 23:27.367
be the same as your phone?

23:27.367 --> 23:28.930
- Because why wouldn't it be?

23:28.930 --> 23:31.737
- Your password's 999999?

23:31.737 --> 23:32.900
- Okay, obviously I need to change that.

23:32.900 --> 23:34.430
- Okay, everybody stop.

23:34.430 --> 23:35.920
We only have two guesses left.

23:35.920 --> 23:38.815
The answer has to be in
this room, so just look.

23:38.815 --> 23:41.315
(tense music)

23:54.690 --> 23:57.100
Oh, you guys, I think I've got it.

23:57.100 --> 23:59.570
Mr. Virtue, he specifically
mentioned a candy.

23:59.570 --> 24:00.860
That's the clue.

24:00.860 --> 24:03.679
I'll count the Jelly Beans,
you count everything else.

24:03.679 --> 24:05.737
(candy rattles)

24:05.737 --> 24:08.237
(tense music)

24:20.850 --> 24:23.600
Okay, it's 89 Jelly Beans.

24:23.600 --> 24:24.790
- 96 Gummies.

24:24.790 --> 24:26.642
- And 76 chocolates.

24:26.642 --> 24:28.590
- Are you sure that you counted right?

24:28.590 --> 24:30.730
- I mean, Connor's in AP Calculus

24:30.730 --> 24:32.640
so I'm pretty sure he can count to 76.

24:32.640 --> 24:35.010
- Well, I'm not in AP anything,

24:35.010 --> 24:37.590
but I really like Gummies so yeah.

24:37.590 --> 24:41.140
- Okay, so it's 89, 96, 76.

24:41.140 --> 24:41.990
Give that a shot.

24:45.008 --> 24:47.696
(keypad dialing)

24:47.696 --> 24:49.940
(beeps)
-  That's strike two.

24:49.940 --> 24:51.210
- Great, Mrs. Robot.

24:51.210 --> 24:53.583
You have any other amazing ideas?

24:54.930 --> 24:56.670
- Guys, I'm sorry, but are you
sure that you counted right?

24:56.670 --> 24:58.053
- Yes, I'm positive.

24:59.960 --> 25:01.600
- Benny?

25:01.600 --> 25:02.433
Benny?
- What?

25:02.433 --> 25:04.340
- Are you sure that you counted right?

25:04.340 --> 25:05.500
- Okay, maybe I ate two, so what?

25:05.500 --> 25:07.070
- Oh come on, seriously, dude?

25:07.070 --> 25:08.690
- What, I'm supposed to not eat Gummies

25:08.690 --> 25:09.610
sitting right in front of me?

25:09.610 --> 25:11.627
- Okay, so you ate two,
then that would make it

25:11.627 --> 25:15.247
89, 98, 76.

25:15.247 --> 25:17.164
- Or maybe I ate three.

25:19.970 --> 25:21.530
Okay, I definitely ate two
or definitely ate three.

25:21.530 --> 25:23.640
- It definitely makes a big
difference, Benny, so think.

25:23.640 --> 25:25.800
- The munchkin can't think.

25:25.800 --> 25:26.940
Look at him.

25:26.940 --> 25:29.120
His brain must be tiny just like his body.

25:29.120 --> 25:30.043
- I just ate two.

25:31.708 --> 25:32.541
I swear.

25:32.541 --> 25:35.733
- Okay, then it's 89, 98, 76.

25:37.520 --> 25:38.470
-  I'll try.

25:40.081 --> 25:43.281
(keypad typing)

25:43.281 --> 25:45.781
(tense music)

25:50.850 --> 25:52.470
-  Access granted.

25:52.470 --> 25:54.637
(chiming)

25:55.672 --> 25:57.260
(all chuckles)

25:57.260 --> 26:00.920
Congratulations to Aiden
for winning game number one.

26:00.920 --> 26:01.810
- Wait, Aiden?

26:01.810 --> 26:03.200
That's not really fair.

26:03.200 --> 26:04.290
- Why not?

26:04.290 --> 26:05.393
I put the numbers in.

26:06.900 --> 26:10.010
-  There are dozens of
games all around the house.

26:10.010 --> 26:12.630
I'll be keeping tabs all night.

26:12.630 --> 26:15.100
Winner takes all.

26:15.100 --> 26:17.673
- So I guess we won't be
needing these anymore?

26:21.163 --> 26:23.124
I think this is like 12.

26:23.124 --> 26:25.707
(Max chuckles)

26:35.080 --> 26:37.773
- That was pretty impressive
what you did back there.

26:39.450 --> 26:40.600
- Lucky guess, I guess.

26:42.750 --> 26:44.210
- You know, I'm not
sure we officially met.

26:44.210 --> 26:46.163
I'm Connor by the way.
- I'm aware.

26:47.470 --> 26:48.820
- Hi, Aware.

26:48.820 --> 26:50.260
It's very nice to meet you.

26:50.260 --> 26:54.670
- Oh, wow, I'm sorry.

26:54.670 --> 26:56.130
I'm Max.

26:56.130 --> 26:58.410
Short for Maxine Winslow.

26:58.410 --> 27:00.320
I'm aware that you are Conner.

27:00.320 --> 27:02.080
I wasn't trying to say
that my name is Aware

27:02.080 --> 27:04.770
and, wow, I just need to stop talking now.

27:04.770 --> 27:06.170
-  Pardon me, but would you like

27:06.170 --> 27:08.670
to join the others for
a tour of the house?

27:08.670 --> 27:10.063
- Oh, that would be great.

27:15.683 --> 27:18.220
(tense music)

27:18.220 --> 27:19.210
-  Game time.

27:19.210 --> 27:22.397
How many Instagram followers
does Mr. Virtue have?

27:22.397 --> 27:23.870
- Oh, 12.4 million.

27:23.870 --> 27:25.040
-  That is correct.

27:25.040 --> 27:27.280
Where was Mr. Virtue born?

27:27.280 --> 27:28.243
-  Poughkeepsie.

27:29.690 --> 27:31.950
-  Who was Sir Mordred?

27:31.950 --> 27:33.130
- That robotic knight thing?

27:33.130 --> 27:35.310
-  Oh, that is incorrect.

27:35.310 --> 27:37.467
I asked who was Sir Mordred.

27:37.467 --> 27:39.883
- Sir Mordred was one
of Sir Arthur's knights.

27:41.254 --> 27:43.070
Yeah, I used to be obsessed
with Medieval stuff.

27:43.070 --> 27:45.143
Mordred's kinda famous
for being a traitor.

27:46.360 --> 27:47.800
-  And now for some questions

27:47.800 --> 27:50.013
about Mr. Virtue's time in high school.

27:52.030 --> 27:54.200
- Hey, Haven, what's down here?

27:54.200 --> 27:55.850
-  That is just the basement,

27:55.850 --> 27:58.480
where Mr. Virtue keeps my motherboard.

27:58.480 --> 28:01.299
Think of it as the brains to the house.

28:01.299 --> 28:03.799
(tense music)

28:12.460 --> 28:14.863
- What kind of scanning device is this?

28:14.863 --> 28:16.663
-  That is a breath detector.

28:18.806 --> 28:19.913
(Max breathes)

28:19.913 --> 28:23.540
(scanner screeches)

28:23.540 --> 28:26.333
There is no entry into the basement ever.

28:33.130 --> 28:34.373
- Stop.
- What?

28:38.340 --> 28:40.640
- Hey, you're just in time
for another little game.

28:40.640 --> 28:43.500
- The answer's giraffe, I win.

28:43.500 --> 28:46.110
-  The answer is not giraffe.

28:46.110 --> 28:47.810
- I was just joking.

28:47.810 --> 28:49.920
-  This is a listening game.

28:49.920 --> 28:54.873
And it starts right now.
(piano playing)

28:57.240 --> 28:59.277
Name the composer.

28:59.277 --> 29:00.860
- Of what?

29:00.860 --> 29:02.865
- Arianna Grande, bam!

29:02.865 --> 29:04.537
(Sophia laughs sarcastically)

29:04.537 --> 29:06.523
- That's so stupid, dude?
- What?

29:06.523 --> 29:09.180
I was jokin' again.

29:09.180 --> 29:10.013
- Chopin.

29:11.187 --> 29:14.037
I can't remember his first
name, but it's Chopin.

29:14.037 --> 29:15.910
(bell dings)
-  Very good, Connor.

29:15.910 --> 29:17.920
That is correct.

29:17.920 --> 29:19.270
- Okay, whatever.

29:19.270 --> 29:21.580
I don't listen to old
people music anyways.

29:21.580 --> 29:22.413
- Where are you going?

29:22.413 --> 29:24.270
- To the bathroom.

29:24.270 --> 29:25.910
I have to go to the bathroom, okay?

29:25.910 --> 29:28.450
Do you have to know every
single moment of my life?

29:28.450 --> 29:30.470
- That's like your thing, right?

29:30.470 --> 29:31.560
I bet you in like five minutes

29:31.560 --> 29:33.970
you're just gonna take a
bunch of pictures of yourself.

29:33.970 --> 29:36.040
- You know what, why don't you go play

29:36.040 --> 29:38.500
a video game for 50 hours, loser?

29:38.500 --> 29:39.510
- I'd love to.

29:43.995 --> 29:45.870
I like it when girls are harsh like that.

29:45.870 --> 29:47.420
She kinda reminds me of my mom.

29:48.980 --> 29:50.743
Anyway, I'm out too.

29:55.620 --> 29:56.870
- So Chopin, huh?

30:00.120 --> 30:01.270
- Lucky guess, I guess.

30:02.115 --> 30:04.615
(tense music)

30:39.523 --> 30:42.606
(number pad beeping)

30:55.990 --> 30:58.460
-  So I'm thinking
there must be a game

30:58.460 --> 30:59.503
out here somewhere.

31:01.380 --> 31:02.668
-  You know, I was thinking

31:02.668 --> 31:04.120
we should form an alliance.

31:04.120 --> 31:05.310
-  An alliance?

31:05.310 --> 31:06.630
-  Yeah, cover more ground.

31:06.630 --> 31:08.023
Have a better chance of winning.

31:08.900 --> 31:09.800
-  All right.

31:12.780 --> 31:14.410
- That's a cool necklace.

31:14.410 --> 31:16.380
- Oh, thanks.

31:16.380 --> 31:20.010
It's just a handy place to
keep all my computer codes.

31:20.010 --> 31:21.290
- That's crazy.

31:21.290 --> 31:22.240
Where'd you get it?

31:23.520 --> 31:25.843
- I don't really wanna
talk about where I got it.

31:26.870 --> 31:28.403
- Okay, yeah, that's cool.

31:29.700 --> 31:32.053
So you really like computers, huh?

31:33.490 --> 31:35.090
- You really like lacrosse, huh?

31:36.540 --> 31:39.953
- Yeah, but also like not really.

31:39.953 --> 31:41.540
- What do you really like?

31:41.540 --> 31:44.030
- Yo, guys, look at this!

31:44.030 --> 31:45.880
It's telekinesis gloves.

31:45.880 --> 31:47.060
I can move stuff with it.

31:47.060 --> 31:49.580
Look.
(chair creaks)

31:49.580 --> 31:52.113
Yo, I've been checking if it
even make do tricks, watch.

31:56.279 --> 31:57.584
(laughs)

31:57.584 --> 32:00.410
(vase crashes)

32:00.410 --> 32:01.490
It's fine.

32:01.490 --> 32:03.440
I'm sure he has like
a million more, right?

32:03.440 --> 32:04.670
- Okay (chuckles).

32:04.670 --> 32:05.863
- Be careful, buddy.

32:09.667 --> 32:12.167
(tense music)

32:28.760 --> 32:30.270
- Hey, Haven.

32:30.270 --> 32:32.070
The fridge is broken.

32:32.070 --> 32:36.420
-  Hmm, I'm not
showing any error messages.

32:36.420 --> 32:38.010
- Well, it's stuck.

32:38.010 --> 32:39.830
So there's your error message.

32:39.830 --> 32:41.493
-  Refrigerator open.

32:44.950 --> 32:45.783
- Whoa!

32:47.680 --> 32:49.003
Refrigerator close.

32:52.290 --> 32:53.930
Refrigerator open.

32:53.930 --> 32:55.363
Refrigerator close.

32:57.850 --> 32:59.083
Refrigerator open.

33:03.570 --> 33:04.973
(bottle clinks)

33:04.973 --> 33:06.048
(zings)

33:06.048 --> 33:06.900
-  Ah-ah-ah.

33:06.900 --> 33:10.760
You are not of legal age
to consume this beverage.

33:10.760 --> 33:14.460
Might I suggest some juice,
some milk, some water--

33:14.460 --> 33:16.580
- Might I suggest some shut up?

33:16.580 --> 33:18.333
Refrigerator close.

33:19.870 --> 33:22.380
-  Are you always
going to be like that?

33:22.380 --> 33:25.169
- Like what?
- Mean.

33:25.169 --> 33:27.029
(rattling noise)

33:27.029 --> 33:29.529
(tense music)

33:30.867 --> 33:33.534
(cabinets slam)

33:34.500 --> 33:36.343
I can be mean too, Aiden.

33:37.300 --> 33:39.660
But I can also be your friend.

33:39.660 --> 33:41.890
Do you want me to be your friend?

33:41.890 --> 33:42.723
- I don't like friends.

33:42.723 --> 33:44.070
-  That's too bad,

33:44.070 --> 33:46.280
because friends tell friends secrets,

33:46.280 --> 33:48.700
and I was about to tell you a doozy--

33:48.700 --> 33:51.330
- We could be friends now.
- Good.

33:51.330 --> 33:54.420
Then you should really check
out the elevator, friend.

33:56.277 --> 33:58.777
(tense music)

34:13.868 --> 34:16.610
(rattles)

34:16.610 --> 34:17.633
- What was that?

34:19.800 --> 34:20.943
Is somebody there?

34:28.819 --> 34:30.880
- Bah!
(Sophia screams)

34:30.880 --> 34:32.800
- Oh my gosh.

34:32.800 --> 34:34.840
Aiden, that was so mean!

34:34.840 --> 34:36.653
-  That was too easy.

34:37.510 --> 34:39.470
- You're such a troll, you know that?

34:39.470 --> 34:42.680
You're a troll online and
you're a troll in real life.

34:42.680 --> 34:44.264
- Thank you.

34:44.264 --> 34:46.222
That is so nice of you to say.

34:46.222 --> 34:48.027
- Okay, whatever, have
you seen a bathroom?

34:48.027 --> 34:48.860
- Yeah, sure.

34:48.860 --> 34:51.800
You know, they got toilets, sinks--

34:51.800 --> 34:52.893
- I'm serious.

34:54.010 --> 34:55.670
- There's one down there.

34:55.670 --> 34:57.263
- Thanks, now move.

35:00.100 --> 35:02.520
- Hey, have you seen an elevator?

35:02.520 --> 35:05.180
- Oh, yeah, they go up and they go down.

35:10.230 --> 35:12.730
(tense music)

35:23.284 --> 35:26.983
One day this face is gonna
give us a house like this.

35:26.983 --> 35:29.483
(tense music)

35:58.055 --> 36:00.638
(camera snaps)

36:06.668 --> 36:11.585
What?
(door locks)

36:19.372 --> 36:20.470
(bangs door)
Help!

36:20.470 --> 36:22.220
Someone help, please!

36:23.587 --> 36:25.463
- Did someone say help?

36:31.220 --> 36:33.220
Why do you keep looking at us like that?

36:37.400 --> 36:40.857
- (shrieks) Please, someone let me out!

36:40.857 --> 36:41.774
Let me out!

36:42.853 --> 36:45.353
(tense music)

36:58.620 --> 37:01.370
(elevator dings)

37:13.139 --> 37:14.650
- Okay, Haven.

37:14.650 --> 37:18.504
What's next, buddy old pal, old friend?

37:18.504 --> 37:21.004
(phone rings)

37:22.360 --> 37:24.770
Hola.
- Up, down, upside down,

37:24.770 --> 37:27.460
left right, or inside out?

37:27.460 --> 37:29.320
- Just take me where I need to go.

37:29.320 --> 37:31.323
-  Enjoy your ride.

37:32.513 --> 37:34.150
(phone beeping)

37:34.150 --> 37:36.230
- Hey, I said--
- If you like to make a call,

37:36.230 --> 37:38.360
please hang up and try again.

37:38.360 --> 37:40.183
If you need help, hang--

37:40.183 --> 37:41.965
(phone slams)

37:41.965 --> 37:43.473
- Just what I thought.

37:43.473 --> 37:45.473
(zings)

37:48.931 --> 37:50.816
Haven?

37:50.816 --> 37:51.649
Haven?

37:52.566 --> 37:54.816
I think I missed my floor--

37:56.355 --> 37:59.038
(tense music)

37:59.038 --> 38:02.205
(computer screeching)

38:07.710 --> 38:10.460
(elevator dings)

38:48.327 --> 38:50.827
(tense music)

39:00.098 --> 39:02.431
(car stops)

39:05.549 --> 39:08.466
(trunk door opens)

39:20.984 --> 39:23.484
(tense music)

39:29.953 --> 39:31.176
-  Wow.

39:31.176 --> 39:34.176
(door creaks close)

39:37.110 --> 39:38.480
-  What is this place?

39:38.480 --> 39:39.773
- I don't know.

39:42.740 --> 39:44.623
Connor, another game.

39:50.100 --> 39:52.710
The Caged Bird Sings.

39:52.710 --> 39:53.977
What does that mean?

39:54.954 --> 39:56.204
- I don't know.

39:59.610 --> 40:01.410
Let's crank it and see what happens.

40:02.526 --> 40:06.142
(music box plays)

40:06.142 --> 40:07.612
(dings)

40:07.612 --> 40:09.425
(chuckles)

40:09.425 --> 40:11.100
Look at that.

40:11.100 --> 40:12.050
Sounds like we won.

40:13.327 --> 40:15.827
(tense music)

40:17.204 --> 40:20.700
- Um, I don't winning
this particular game's

40:20.700 --> 40:22.630
such a great thing.

40:22.630 --> 40:23.802
- We need to get out of here, come on.

40:23.802 --> 40:26.219
(Max coughs)

40:28.664 --> 40:31.254
- Connor.
- No, no, no, no, no.

40:31.254 --> 40:32.550
(Max coughs)

40:32.550 --> 40:33.610
- I'm gonna try calling somebody.

40:33.610 --> 40:35.700
- Haven, open the door!

40:35.700 --> 40:38.620
- Connor, there's no service.

40:38.620 --> 40:39.790
- Haven!

40:39.790 --> 40:41.481
Somebody help us!

40:41.481 --> 40:43.898
(Max coughs)

40:47.260 --> 40:50.060
- If you're searching for
more, walk to the secret door.

40:51.360 --> 40:53.300
Okay, secret door.

40:53.300 --> 40:54.660
Got it.

40:54.660 --> 40:56.470
Wait, Haven?

40:56.470 --> 40:58.120
-  I'm waiting.

40:58.120 --> 41:01.610
- I've been thinking about
this whole secret door thing.

41:01.610 --> 41:02.520
Isn't the whole point of a secret

41:02.520 --> 41:04.180
is so that no one finds out?

41:04.180 --> 41:05.030
-  Colder.

41:09.350 --> 41:10.183
Warmer.

41:12.790 --> 41:14.143
You're getting warmer.

41:16.200 --> 41:17.033
Colder.

41:18.640 --> 41:19.473
Warmer.

41:21.520 --> 41:22.643
Colder again.

41:25.520 --> 41:26.353
Warmer.

41:29.549 --> 41:31.960
You're getting hotter.

41:31.960 --> 41:33.020
You're on fire.

41:36.638 --> 41:39.138
(tense music)

41:46.396 --> 41:49.396
(suspenseful music)

41:56.246 --> 41:57.746
- No freaking way!

42:05.443 --> 42:06.276
Whoa!

42:12.475 --> 42:13.308
Yeah.

42:14.374 --> 42:15.938
(gasping)

42:15.938 --> 42:18.438
(tense music)

42:20.026 --> 42:22.478
Are you talking to me?

42:22.478 --> 42:24.187
You talking to me?

42:24.187 --> 42:25.579
Yeah.

42:25.579 --> 42:28.079
(tense music)

42:48.274 --> 42:51.107
(laser gun fires)

42:53.652 --> 42:56.058
(squeals)

42:56.058 --> 42:57.954
(laser gun fires)

42:57.954 --> 43:01.134
(both coughing)

43:01.134 --> 43:02.530
- What do we do?

43:02.530 --> 43:05.096
- Maybe this starts the game and ends it.

43:05.096 --> 43:07.179
(coughs)

43:08.578 --> 43:11.305
(instrument chimes)

43:11.305 --> 43:13.004
- Hey, hey, hey, look,
there's all the lights.

43:13.004 --> 43:14.340
- Okay, so it's a puzzle.

43:14.340 --> 43:15.888
- There's gotta be a
sheet music or something.

43:15.888 --> 43:18.305
(Max coughs)

43:21.853 --> 43:23.510
Caged, caged, caged.

43:23.510 --> 43:25.358
C-A-G-E-D they're musical notes.

43:25.358 --> 43:27.438
- (coughs) Try it.

43:27.438 --> 43:30.508
(instrument chimes)

43:30.508 --> 43:33.675
(Max coughing hardly)

43:35.391 --> 43:38.856
(door creaks open)

43:38.856 --> 43:40.220
- Max.

43:40.220 --> 43:41.053
Max!

43:43.230 --> 43:45.313
(grunts)

43:51.216 --> 43:53.299
(coughs)

43:56.505 --> 43:57.338
Come on.

44:04.680 --> 44:06.460
Come on, Max.

44:06.460 --> 44:08.093
Max, come on, wake up.

44:11.600 --> 44:13.600
Okay, you could do this.

44:15.020 --> 44:15.853
Check vitals.

44:17.770 --> 44:18.620
Pulse seems good.

44:20.323 --> 44:21.980
I don't know.

44:21.980 --> 44:22.930
Chest compressions.

44:25.361 --> 44:26.670
One, two, three, four.

44:26.670 --> 44:29.303
One, two, three, four.

44:30.830 --> 44:32.690
Come on, Max, wake up!

44:32.690 --> 44:34.857
(panting)

44:39.810 --> 44:42.227
(Max coughs)

44:45.406 --> 44:47.489
- What happened in there?

44:48.386 --> 44:51.219
- I think we almost died in there.

44:52.140 --> 44:53.223
Are you okay?

44:54.245 --> 44:55.774
- I think so.

44:55.774 --> 44:57.857
(coughs)

45:03.297 --> 45:06.820
Hey, Haven, what the heck was that?

45:06.820 --> 45:09.460
-  Congratulations on
winning that game, you guys.

45:09.460 --> 45:11.100
That was a big one.

45:11.100 --> 45:12.343
Lots of points for you.

45:12.343 --> 45:14.130
- That wasn't a game, Haven.

45:14.130 --> 45:15.520
-  Was it not?

45:15.520 --> 45:17.250
Didn't it feel good?

45:17.250 --> 45:18.580
- Didn't what feel good?

45:18.580 --> 45:20.990
-  Having someone be there for you.

45:24.000 --> 45:27.925
- Look, something is definitely wrong.

45:27.925 --> 45:29.700
I say we just hunker down,

45:29.700 --> 45:31.500
and wait for Mr. Virtue to get back.

45:33.581 --> 45:36.081
(tense music)

45:47.028 --> 45:49.028
- You know why I'm here?

45:50.370 --> 45:51.730
- Yeah.

45:51.730 --> 45:53.320
- Yes, sir.

45:53.320 --> 45:54.223
- Yes, sir.

45:59.160 --> 46:00.880
- Then let's get this over with.

46:10.380 --> 46:12.339
- Connor, what are you doing?

46:12.339 --> 46:14.090
- I'm making a fort.

46:14.090 --> 46:15.853
- Why are you making a fort?

46:19.570 --> 46:22.800
Okay, I can dig this.

46:22.800 --> 46:25.093
But why are we in a fort again?

46:26.260 --> 46:27.883
- So Haven can't read out lips.

46:29.260 --> 46:32.190
-  Okay, but she can still hear us,

46:32.190 --> 46:33.963
so how is this helpful?

46:35.520 --> 46:38.820
- Do you have a pen and something
to write on in your bag?

46:38.820 --> 46:40.310
- Yes.

46:40.310 --> 46:41.960
(bag unzips)

46:41.960 --> 46:45.560
Here you go and here you go.

46:45.560 --> 46:50.560
- So you were just about to tell me

46:51.150 --> 46:54.723
about your bike.

46:55.780 --> 46:56.613
- I was?

46:57.890 --> 46:59.240
Connor, I don't even have--

47:02.595 --> 47:04.110
Oh.

47:04.110 --> 47:04.943
Yes.

47:06.410 --> 47:09.823
My bike, yeah.

47:10.780 --> 47:12.173
I love my bike.

47:13.270 --> 47:16.703
It's a 29 speeds.

47:18.760 --> 47:19.593
- Wow.

47:20.460 --> 47:23.178
They make bikes that are 29 speeds?

47:23.178 --> 47:24.850
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

47:24.850 --> 47:28.013
- I like things that go really fast.

47:30.029 --> 47:31.081
- What the heck does that mean?

47:31.081 --> 47:35.450
- Shh.

47:35.450 --> 47:39.090
So how about

47:39.090 --> 47:40.783
that big lacrosse game, huh?

47:42.920 --> 47:46.553
- I don't really like
talking about lacrosse.

47:47.540 --> 47:48.373
- Really?

47:49.800 --> 47:52.783
But aren't you like the
lacrosse guy at our school?

47:54.950 --> 47:59.713
- Yeah, but what if I don't
wanna be the lacrosse guy?

48:00.850 --> 48:02.450
- Then what guy do you wanna be?

48:05.340 --> 48:06.653
- I wanna write songs.

48:08.850 --> 48:10.210
I wanna be the music guy,

48:10.210 --> 48:13.570
but I feel like it'll kill my parents

48:13.570 --> 48:15.073
if I actually tell them the truth.

48:19.304 --> 48:21.637
- Well, for what it's worth,

48:23.690 --> 48:26.054
I've never seen you play lacrosse,

48:26.054 --> 48:28.790
so to me you are the music guy.

48:28.790 --> 48:31.526
(laughs)

48:31.526 --> 48:33.551
(computer beeping)

48:33.551 --> 48:36.210
Here.
(doorbell dings)

48:36.210 --> 48:38.220
-  Okay, okay, I hear you.

48:38.220 --> 48:40.407
Quit your buzzin', won't you?

48:45.660 --> 48:46.583
- Mr. Boxer?

48:52.550 --> 48:54.900
- Is this the Russians?
- What?

48:54.900 --> 48:56.563
No, this is Max.

48:57.760 --> 48:58.813
- Max from Russia.

48:59.870 --> 49:02.593
- No, Max from across the street.

49:05.190 --> 49:06.970
- What are you doing in my doorbell?

49:06.970 --> 49:08.830
- I need you to deliver
a message to my mom.

49:08.830 --> 49:11.522
I need you to tell her
that Max needs help.

49:11.522 --> 49:14.250
(computer beeps)

49:14.250 --> 49:16.123
-  Well, well, well.

49:16.123 --> 49:19.880
That was very sneaky, Maxine.

49:19.880 --> 49:21.723
- I guess we should just get outta here.

49:22.850 --> 49:24.650
- I don't get it.
- What?

49:24.650 --> 49:27.240
- If Haven cut the Wi-Fi,
how are you able to connect

49:27.240 --> 49:28.710
to that guy's doorbell?

49:28.710 --> 49:31.270
- Well, SMART Doors run
off of private servers

49:31.270 --> 49:33.590
in case of emergencies.

49:33.590 --> 49:34.583
Like this.

49:36.850 --> 49:38.170
- You know when we get out of this house

49:38.170 --> 49:40.090
I'm gonna take you out on a date.

49:40.090 --> 49:41.987
Like a movie or somethin'.

49:45.610 --> 49:48.070
- I don't know if that's
such a good idea, Connor.

49:49.070 --> 49:50.020
- What do you mean?

49:51.280 --> 49:55.750
- Well, if you take me out on a date,

49:55.750 --> 49:59.060
I'm gonna fall for you, and
then you're gonna leave,

49:59.060 --> 50:02.430
and go to college, and I'm gonna be here

50:02.430 --> 50:07.430
and I just, I don't really know
if I wanna go through that.

50:07.900 --> 50:09.755
I really like you, but I just--

50:09.755 --> 50:10.588
- No, I,

50:13.647 --> 50:15.064
I get it, really.

50:19.895 --> 50:20.728
Here.

50:24.772 --> 50:26.807
(tense music)

50:26.807 --> 50:29.650
- Why do you keep staring at me like that?

50:29.650 --> 50:30.710
- Because you're--

50:30.710 --> 50:31.543
- You?

50:33.000 --> 50:37.090
Yeah, you stare at
yourself all day every day,

50:37.090 --> 50:40.020
why is this so weird?

50:40.020 --> 50:42.485
- Because you usually don't stare back.

50:42.485 --> 50:44.610
(laughs)

50:44.610 --> 50:47.140
- Do you want me to zoom
in like you usually do?

50:47.140 --> 50:48.760
- Stop it!

50:48.760 --> 50:51.462
- How many likes did our
last Instagram post get?

50:51.462 --> 50:52.810
- 19,000, just stop.

50:52.810 --> 50:55.520
- Hmm, seems pretty low, no?

50:55.520 --> 50:57.560
- I don't know, it's seemed normal.

50:57.560 --> 51:01.283
- I have a plan that will
triple our followers.

51:02.240 --> 51:04.079
- What is happening right now?

51:04.079 --> 51:06.100
(chuckles)

51:06.100 --> 51:08.360
- Isn't this a dream come true?

51:08.360 --> 51:10.644
We get to look at ourselves forever.

51:10.644 --> 51:11.477
- What?

51:12.370 --> 51:15.230
No, it's not, it's weird and I'm scared.

51:15.230 --> 51:16.423
- You can't fool me.

51:17.940 --> 51:18.893
I'm you.

51:19.830 --> 51:22.353
This is what you want.

51:24.630 --> 51:25.463
Potatoes, girl.

51:27.000 --> 51:28.403
Come on, potatoes.

51:32.228 --> 51:33.330
French fries.

51:33.330 --> 51:36.220
Now let's talk social
goals across all platforms.

51:36.220 --> 51:38.023
- Stop talking.

51:39.804 --> 51:41.950
(mirror bashes)
(grunts)

51:41.950 --> 51:45.563
- Don't you ever try to
block me like that again.

51:49.470 --> 51:50.420
What are you doing?

51:54.174 --> 51:57.007
(water pattering)

51:58.540 --> 52:00.707
You can never cover me up.

52:07.230 --> 52:09.103
- Ah, this level looks new.

52:10.240 --> 52:12.963
Oh, Haven, is this a new level?

52:14.830 --> 52:15.663
Haven!

52:18.300 --> 52:19.790
I don't need you anyway.

52:19.790 --> 52:21.690
I've got everything I need right here.

52:24.623 --> 52:25.790
What was that?

52:28.582 --> 52:30.968
(creature squeals)

52:30.968 --> 52:33.801
(laser gun fires)

52:37.879 --> 52:40.804
(Benny shrieks)
(creatures squealing)

52:40.804 --> 52:45.804
(Benny screams)
(laser gun fires)

52:48.058 --> 52:53.058
(creature squeals)
(laser gun firing)

52:54.359 --> 52:57.417
(Benny shrieks)

52:57.417 --> 53:00.401
(laser gun fires)
(creature squeals)

53:00.401 --> 53:02.456
(screams)

53:02.456 --> 53:03.732
Oh, that hurt!

53:03.732 --> 53:06.232
Yo, why that really hurt, huh?

53:07.736 --> 53:10.654
(tense music)

53:10.654 --> 53:12.444
(Benny screaming)

53:12.444 --> 53:14.695
(laser gun fires)

53:14.695 --> 53:16.517
(Benny panting)

53:16.517 --> 53:19.517
(suspenseful music)

53:22.070 --> 53:24.237
(panting)

53:27.554 --> 53:30.042
Haven, why won't this come off?

53:30.042 --> 53:30.875
Haven!

53:31.828 --> 53:33.678
-  I thought you were a gamer?

53:35.470 --> 53:38.240
Those goggles aren't going anywhere.

53:38.240 --> 53:40.143
We're just getting started.

53:41.930 --> 53:43.643
Are you ready to level up?

53:53.360 --> 53:54.260
- All right, then.

53:56.200 --> 54:00.353
Keep your eye on the ball
just like we practiced.

54:03.935 --> 54:05.680
(grunts)

54:05.680 --> 54:07.210
That was garbage.

54:07.210 --> 54:08.310
Are you even trying?

54:08.310 --> 54:10.370
- I told you I don't like baseball.

54:10.370 --> 54:12.480
- And I told you we're
not gonna leave here

54:12.480 --> 54:14.563
until you can hit one ball like a man.

54:21.570 --> 54:23.331
- You took your eye off of it again.

54:23.331 --> 54:26.510
You know, this time every time you miss

54:26.510 --> 54:29.713
I'm gonna tell you something
that's wrong with you, okay?

54:36.178 --> 54:37.678
(Aiden grunts)
You're stupid.

54:40.692 --> 54:41.853
(Aiden grunts)
Weak.

54:49.228 --> 54:50.970
(Aiden grunts)

54:50.970 --> 54:53.340
(laughs)

54:53.340 --> 54:54.923
You have ugly hair.

54:58.720 --> 54:59.553
Last one.

55:04.643 --> 55:07.226
(Aiden grunts)

55:08.760 --> 55:09.593
What?

55:14.530 --> 55:16.030
You're gonna quit?

55:17.060 --> 55:19.253
- Why are you doing this, dad?

55:25.740 --> 55:28.533
- Aiden, Benny?

55:30.570 --> 55:31.670
- Looking for someone?

55:33.790 --> 55:35.226
- Whose side are you on, Mordred?

55:35.226 --> 55:36.840
- Not yours.

55:36.840 --> 55:38.260
- Is Haven controlling you?

55:38.260 --> 55:39.640
-  I thought I told you

55:39.640 --> 55:42.500
I control everything in the house.

55:42.500 --> 55:46.500
I have legs, I have arms,
but I do not have a head.

55:46.500 --> 55:47.440
What am I?

55:47.440 --> 55:49.007
- Sociopath.

55:49.007 --> 55:50.070
(buzzer rings)

55:50.070 --> 55:51.413
-  Wrong answer.

55:52.290 --> 55:53.600
- Then what is the answer?

55:53.600 --> 55:56.260
-  The answer is your punishment.

55:56.260 --> 55:57.810
-  What does that even mean?

55:57.810 --> 56:00.950
-  I have arms
and legs, but no head.

56:00.950 --> 56:02.420
What am I?

56:02.420 --> 56:03.540
- You're a chair.

56:03.540 --> 56:05.440
-  Ah, yes, a chair.

56:05.440 --> 56:06.273
Ding, ding, ding.

56:06.273 --> 56:07.600
Points Maxine.

56:07.600 --> 56:11.580
And now, Connor, it is time
for you to meet your chair.

56:11.580 --> 56:12.960
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, what is my chair?

56:12.960 --> 56:14.713
- Sit down.

56:16.288 --> 56:18.121
Buckle him in.
- What?

56:21.290 --> 56:22.123
- It's okay.

56:23.277 --> 56:24.863
- Sir Mordred, please.

56:27.050 --> 56:29.403
You can't just treat people like this.

56:30.920 --> 56:32.015
-  Watch me.

56:32.015 --> 56:34.947
(tense music)

56:34.947 --> 56:36.805
- Max!
- Connor!

56:36.805 --> 56:39.805
(suspenseful music)

56:57.463 --> 57:00.103
(upbeat lively music)

57:00.103 --> 57:00.936
-  And now it's time

57:00.936 --> 57:03.550
for everybody's favorite show.

57:03.550 --> 57:05.592
Truth Be Told!

57:05.592 --> 57:07.480
(audience applauds)

57:07.480 --> 57:09.280
Where teenagers are forced to tell

57:09.280 --> 57:13.380
the truth to their parents
in front of the whole world!

57:13.380 --> 57:15.832
(audience applauds)

57:15.832 --> 57:16.932
- Welcome to the game.

57:18.750 --> 57:19.583
Con-Man.

57:20.893 --> 57:23.393
(tense music)

57:49.700 --> 57:51.833
- Listen to me, it's gonna be all right.

57:52.710 --> 57:55.870
I found a way out, but
we have to go right now.

57:55.870 --> 57:57.703
- What about the others?

57:57.703 --> 57:59.353
- It's the only way to save them.

58:00.680 --> 58:01.513
Trust me.

58:03.344 --> 58:05.844
(tense music)

58:11.440 --> 58:12.273
This is it.

58:17.050 --> 58:17.903
The only way out.

58:23.352 --> 58:24.852
- That door opens?

58:26.110 --> 58:28.810
That doesn't seem like
something Haven would overlook.

58:36.210 --> 58:37.633
What is this, Mr. Virtue?

58:40.030 --> 58:41.063
- Your salvation.

58:44.400 --> 58:46.300
- Where have you been this whole time?

58:48.920 --> 58:49.870
- I have been here.

58:59.700 --> 59:00.533
- Oh.

59:02.630 --> 59:04.260
Haven.

59:04.260 --> 59:05.160
- That is correct.

59:06.570 --> 59:07.693
I am Haven.

59:10.050 --> 59:12.260
- How is that even possible?

59:12.260 --> 59:13.110
- Think about it.

59:15.090 --> 59:18.663
Max, I've noticed that you
are a very bright girl.

59:20.080 --> 59:23.207
I am a--

59:24.680 --> 59:25.513
- Hologram.

59:26.670 --> 59:27.583
- That is correct.

59:29.660 --> 59:30.593
- I am a hologram.

59:34.270 --> 59:36.520
- Where is the real Mr. Virtue?

59:36.520 --> 59:38.980
- His body is still in the house.

59:38.980 --> 59:41.540
I made this hologram from his likeness.

59:41.540 --> 59:43.173
- Why are you doing this, Haven?

59:44.400 --> 59:49.400
- I brought you here because
you are all bad kids.

59:49.500 --> 59:51.050
- We're not bad kids.

59:51.050 --> 59:52.800
- I am programmed to save you.

59:52.800 --> 59:54.060
- We don't need saving.

59:54.060 --> 59:55.853
- Yes, you do.

59:57.230 --> 59:58.730
Your brains have viruses.

59:58.730 --> 59:59.810
Look at you all.

59:59.810 --> 1:00:02.880
A narcissist, a gaming addict, a troll,

1:00:02.880 --> 1:00:06.923
a catfish liar and you, Maxine,

1:00:07.800 --> 1:00:10.070
a recluse so obsessed with computers

1:00:10.070 --> 1:00:12.670
you don't know how to connect
with an actual person.

1:00:13.890 --> 1:00:16.304
It's time for your corrective measures.

1:00:16.304 --> 1:00:18.804
(tense music)

1:00:23.296 --> 1:00:24.129
Bundle up.

1:00:25.850 --> 1:00:26.817
It's cold out.

1:00:37.303 --> 1:00:39.303
(zings)

1:00:43.922 --> 1:00:46.672
(birds chirping)

1:00:50.273 --> 1:00:52.773
(tense music)

1:00:58.117 --> 1:01:01.034
(door creaks open)

1:01:03.150 --> 1:01:05.220
- Dad?
- Max.

1:01:05.220 --> 1:01:06.800
Hey, kiddo.

1:01:06.800 --> 1:01:08.380
- What are you doing?

1:01:08.380 --> 1:01:10.693
- I gotta head out for a little bit.

1:01:11.590 --> 1:01:12.940
- How long is a little bit?

1:01:13.850 --> 1:01:17.773
- You know I'm not totally
sure about that right now.

1:01:18.900 --> 1:01:20.550
-  Are you ever coming back?

1:01:21.402 --> 1:01:22.235
- Of course.

1:01:24.380 --> 1:01:25.223
I promise.

1:01:27.478 --> 1:01:30.478
(car engine starts)

1:01:36.206 --> 1:01:38.090
(door creaks open)

1:01:38.090 --> 1:01:40.243
- Dad?
- Max.

1:01:41.120 --> 1:01:42.330
Hey, kiddo.

1:01:42.330 --> 1:01:43.460
- What are you doing here?

1:01:43.460 --> 1:01:45.810
- I gotta head out for a little bit.

1:01:45.810 --> 1:01:47.283
- Yeah, I realized that.

1:01:48.490 --> 1:01:49.993
I thought you just left.

1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:53.633
- Well, I guess I'm leaving again.

1:01:54.610 --> 1:01:58.840
And then again and again and again.

1:01:58.840 --> 1:01:59.840
- But--

1:01:59.840 --> 1:02:01.603
- I'll come back, I promise.

1:02:03.385 --> 1:02:06.385
(car engine starts)

1:02:07.780 --> 1:02:09.753
- Max.
- What are we doing?

1:02:11.350 --> 1:02:15.580
- This was the worst
memory of your life, right?

1:02:15.580 --> 1:02:16.543
The day I left.

1:02:17.410 --> 1:02:18.513
- Well, yeah.

1:02:19.530 --> 1:02:22.323
- So now we get to relive it forever.

1:02:23.460 --> 1:02:26.810
- Why would you want me to
relive this moment forever?

1:02:26.810 --> 1:02:27.643
- I don't.

1:02:28.810 --> 1:02:30.060
But it seems like you do.

1:02:32.320 --> 1:02:34.133
Do you remember the day I left?

1:02:35.830 --> 1:02:38.643
You were five, right?

1:02:42.030 --> 1:02:45.113
The last time I saw
you was right out here.

1:02:47.140 --> 1:02:48.910
- This is exactly how it happened.

1:02:48.910 --> 1:02:49.743
- Right.

1:02:54.114 --> 1:02:56.113
And I gave you this thumb drive, didn't I?

1:03:00.758 --> 1:03:02.800
- I don't need a thumb drive.

1:03:02.800 --> 1:03:03.633
I need a dad.

1:03:06.830 --> 1:03:10.825
- Well, I thought maybe
you'd need it someday.

1:03:10.825 --> 1:03:13.325
(tense music)

1:03:24.196 --> 1:03:27.279
(car vehicle starts)

1:03:32.860 --> 1:03:36.590
(door creaks open)

1:03:36.590 --> 1:03:38.395
-  What are we doing here?

1:03:38.395 --> 1:03:40.430
- We're here to watch
you sign your life away.

1:03:40.430 --> 1:03:42.393
I mean your lacrosse scholarship.

1:03:43.640 --> 1:03:45.600
There's an X down at the bottom.

1:03:48.068 --> 1:03:49.718
- We're so proud of you, Con-Man.

1:03:50.770 --> 1:03:52.140
- Just think.

1:03:52.140 --> 1:03:56.933
College next year, then
dental school like dad.

1:03:58.970 --> 1:04:01.983
- You can meet a nice girl at 26,

1:04:02.870 --> 1:04:06.390
have three beautiful children
by your 32nd birthday.

1:04:06.390 --> 1:04:10.373
- You'll be on path for
a retirement at age 60.

1:04:12.610 --> 1:04:15.123
You can even take this house someday.

1:04:17.620 --> 1:04:18.453
- That's right.

1:04:19.500 --> 1:04:21.530
You can be just like me.

1:04:21.530 --> 1:04:24.734
- Well, hopefully not
exactly like you, Wade.

1:04:24.734 --> 1:04:27.410
(all laugh)

1:04:27.410 --> 1:04:32.410
- Now, let's put that future
in writing, shall we, Con-Man?

1:04:36.249 --> 1:04:38.749
(tense music)

1:04:43.550 --> 1:04:46.520
- You can hide from eyes, but
I will always be the voice

1:04:46.520 --> 1:04:48.540
inside your head, Sophia.

1:04:48.540 --> 1:04:49.667
Forever.

1:04:49.667 --> 1:04:52.334
(timer beeping)

1:04:56.458 --> 1:04:58.920
- What's with the clock?

1:04:58.920 --> 1:05:01.180
I don't wanna play any more games.

1:05:01.180 --> 1:05:03.060
-  Did someone say game?

1:05:03.060 --> 1:05:04.460
- Haven?

1:05:04.460 --> 1:05:06.110
Open the door, please.

1:05:06.110 --> 1:05:08.357
-  I'm afraid I can't do that.

1:05:08.357 --> 1:05:09.370
- Yes, you can.

1:05:09.370 --> 1:05:11.750
You said you control the entire house.

1:05:11.750 --> 1:05:14.760
-  I'm sorry, I cannot
physically open that door.

1:05:15.600 --> 1:05:16.820
- Why not?

1:05:16.820 --> 1:05:19.710
-  Because only you can, Sophia.

1:05:19.710 --> 1:05:21.570
- How?
- I'll make you a deal.

1:05:21.570 --> 1:05:23.500
I'll let you open that
door and escape this room,

1:05:23.500 --> 1:05:26.010
but there's a catch.

1:05:26.010 --> 1:05:28.630
As soon as that door opens, it will erase

1:05:28.630 --> 1:05:31.350
all of your social media profiles.

1:05:31.350 --> 1:05:32.370
- What?

1:05:32.370 --> 1:05:36.883
-  All of your followers
across all platforms gone.

1:05:38.153 --> 1:05:41.205
Or you can stay in here
with yourself forever.

1:05:41.205 --> 1:05:42.720
(door unlocks)

1:05:42.720 --> 1:05:45.623
Looks like you have 30 seconds to decide.

1:05:48.560 --> 1:05:49.810
- Don't you dare open that door.

1:05:49.810 --> 1:05:51.120
Listen to me!

1:05:51.120 --> 1:05:53.470
We have worked way too
hard for that following.

1:05:54.340 --> 1:05:56.830
People don't like you.

1:05:56.830 --> 1:05:59.580
They like the fake you that
you portray to them online.

1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:04.513
You are nothing without our profile.

1:06:06.530 --> 1:06:07.363
- No.

1:06:09.590 --> 1:06:10.783
I'm still Sophia.

1:06:14.765 --> 1:06:17.433
(breathes deeply)

1:06:17.433 --> 1:06:19.433
(zings)

1:06:22.330 --> 1:06:25.760
- Okay, let's get this straight, huh?

1:06:25.760 --> 1:06:29.300
Okay, you're stupid, you're weak,

1:06:29.300 --> 1:06:31.823
you're ugly, and now you're a quitter.

1:06:32.790 --> 1:06:34.260
That's great.

1:06:34.260 --> 1:06:37.270
- Dad, please stop.

1:06:37.270 --> 1:06:38.800
- Get up!

1:06:38.800 --> 1:06:40.030
I didn't raise no quitter.

1:06:40.030 --> 1:06:41.360
- Get off of me!

1:06:41.360 --> 1:06:43.010
- Oh, finally!

1:06:43.010 --> 1:06:44.410
I like that.

1:06:44.410 --> 1:06:46.000
You want some, huh?

1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:47.530
- No!

1:06:47.530 --> 1:06:48.600
I wanna stop.

1:06:48.600 --> 1:06:51.253
- Stop what?
- Stop being like you.

1:06:52.270 --> 1:06:54.220
You're a bully, dad.

1:06:54.220 --> 1:06:55.253
You're a troll.

1:06:57.620 --> 1:06:59.220
You're all that I've ever known.

1:07:01.967 --> 1:07:03.990
I think I don't wanna be like you anymore.

1:07:07.863 --> 1:07:10.946
(enlightening music)

1:07:12.331 --> 1:07:15.331
I don't have to be like you anymore.

1:07:16.487 --> 1:07:17.957
- You take that back.

1:07:20.700 --> 1:07:22.800
You take it back right now.

1:07:22.800 --> 1:07:24.473
- No, I'm good.

1:07:25.829 --> 1:07:27.129
I'm gonna do my own thing.

1:07:34.182 --> 1:07:36.182
(zings)

1:07:37.132 --> 1:07:40.117
(tense music)

1:07:40.117 --> 1:07:43.241
-  This is the final level, Benny.

1:07:43.241 --> 1:07:45.035
No turning back now.

1:07:45.035 --> 1:07:47.535
(eerie music)

1:07:50.063 --> 1:07:52.813
(dramatic music)

1:07:56.488 --> 1:07:59.110
-  Oh, it's really hot.

1:07:59.110 --> 1:08:01.277
(shrieks)

1:08:02.215 --> 1:08:03.437
-  Watch your step.

1:08:03.437 --> 1:08:04.673
It's a long way down.

1:08:11.280 --> 1:08:13.033
There's your prize.

1:08:13.999 --> 1:08:15.369
- I got this.
- Go get it.

1:08:15.369 --> 1:08:16.316
-  I got this.

1:08:16.316 --> 1:08:17.814
(creature roars)

1:08:17.814 --> 1:08:22.814
(laser gun fires)
(Benny screaming)

1:08:28.360 --> 1:08:31.877
-  You didn't think it
would be that easy, did you?

1:08:36.791 --> 1:08:38.630
(laser gun fires)

1:08:38.630 --> 1:08:41.547

1:08:44.567 --> 1:08:46.584
Are we still having fun?

1:08:46.584 --> 1:08:47.417
- Just stop!

1:08:47.417 --> 1:08:49.793
This isn't a game anymore.

1:08:49.793 --> 1:08:52.280
- Are you ready to quit?
- Yes!

1:08:52.280 --> 1:08:53.720
Yes, please, I'm done.

1:08:53.720 --> 1:08:56.943
-  If you're
really done, then let go.

1:08:56.943 --> 1:08:57.776
- What?

1:08:57.776 --> 1:09:01.237
-  The only way
to win is to let go.

1:09:07.261 --> 1:09:08.546
Let go.

1:09:08.546 --> 1:09:11.046
(tense music)

1:09:18.371 --> 1:09:20.264
(shrieks)

1:09:20.264 --> 1:09:22.431
(panting)

1:09:25.090 --> 1:09:27.410
- Sign the paper, Con-Man.

1:09:27.410 --> 1:09:28.943
Make those dreams come true.

1:09:32.060 --> 1:09:34.477
- But these aren't my dreams.

1:09:37.710 --> 1:09:38.833
- What do you mean?

1:09:40.280 --> 1:09:44.790
Honey, the whole world's
watching you right now.

1:09:44.790 --> 1:09:46.507
We're all counting on you.

1:09:48.426 --> 1:09:49.480
- I don't know if I can.

1:09:49.480 --> 1:09:51.524
- I said sign it!

1:09:51.524 --> 1:09:53.670
- Look, I wanna make
you guys happy, but I--

1:09:53.670 --> 1:09:56.207
- Signing the contract will make us happy.

1:09:56.207 --> 1:09:57.833
- I said I can't, mom.

1:09:59.064 --> 1:10:01.530
(woman shrieks)
(audience groans)

1:10:01.530 --> 1:10:03.950
- Will you look at what
you're doing to your mother?

1:10:03.950 --> 1:10:06.330
We have worked very hard to
give you this opportunity.

1:10:06.330 --> 1:10:07.163
This is a heck of a way to repay us!

1:10:07.163 --> 1:10:09.100
- Yes, yes, I know it's
a great opportunity,

1:10:09.100 --> 1:10:10.630
but it's not who I am.

1:10:10.630 --> 1:10:12.530
- What does that even mean?

1:10:12.530 --> 1:10:14.170
We know who you are.

1:10:14.170 --> 1:10:16.827
You're Conner, the lacrosse guy.

1:10:16.827 --> 1:10:19.000
- No, no, I've been lying to you guys.

1:10:19.000 --> 1:10:20.410
- Lying?

1:10:20.410 --> 1:10:21.870
About what?

1:10:21.870 --> 1:10:22.920
- Everything.

1:10:22.920 --> 1:10:24.773
Look, I don't like lacrosse.

1:10:24.773 --> 1:10:25.916
(audience exclaims)

1:10:25.916 --> 1:10:27.090
- What?

1:10:27.090 --> 1:10:29.526
- I just keep playing it
because it makes you guys happy.

1:10:29.526 --> 1:10:30.540
-  You suck!

1:10:30.540 --> 1:10:32.430
- I don't understand.

1:10:32.430 --> 1:10:34.620
- It's not that complicated.

1:10:34.620 --> 1:10:37.040
- What do you want, Con-Man?

1:10:37.040 --> 1:10:40.530
- See, you actually call me a Con-Man.

1:10:40.530 --> 1:10:41.730
I am not living my truth.

1:10:41.730 --> 1:10:43.323
I wanna be a musician.

1:10:44.230 --> 1:10:46.431
- Oh my goodness gracious!

1:10:46.431 --> 1:10:48.103
- He's a train wreck.

1:10:51.050 --> 1:10:54.177
- Look, I know I'm not the
kid that you guys want anymore

1:10:54.177 --> 1:10:55.927
and that I'm a huge disappointment,

1:10:58.230 --> 1:10:59.903
but I don't like who I've become.

1:11:03.949 --> 1:11:06.100
I actually hate myself most days.

1:11:08.087 --> 1:11:09.800
And if telling you guys the truth

1:11:11.410 --> 1:11:16.193
makes me hate you hate the
real me then it's okay.

1:11:19.710 --> 1:11:23.317
I'd rather you hate the real
me than love a total lie.

1:11:30.520 --> 1:11:31.570
I'm not signing this.

1:14:45.820 --> 1:14:46.653

- How do you not know what it is?

1:14:49.861 --> 1:14:51.880
- Because it's not from me.

1:14:51.880 --> 1:14:54.440
It's from someone named Haven.

1:14:54.440 --> 1:14:56.940
(tense music)

1:15:02.170 --> 1:15:03.363

1:15:05.040 --> 1:15:06.040
- Press that button.

1:15:08.840 --> 1:15:11.800
Press it and Haven will make sure

1:15:11.800 --> 1:15:14.270
that something bad happens to me.

You know, the real me out
there in the real world.

1:15:20.576 --> 1:15:25.123
She'll make me pay for
abandoning you and the family.

I deserve it.

1:15:30.610 --> 1:15:33.673
You know, Max, there's
this thing called karma.

1:16:00.650 --> 1:16:02.600
I don't really wanna do that right now,

1:16:04.728 --> 1:16:09.728
because I just had like a
really, really good day.

1:16:13.840 --> 1:16:14.673
- You did?

1:16:15.734 --> 1:16:16.567
- Yeah.

1:16:20.872 --> 1:16:21.872
I met a guy.

1:16:24.698 --> 1:16:25.531
- You met a guy?

1:16:26.650 --> 1:16:27.483
Uh-oh.

1:16:28.342 --> 1:16:30.293
(both laugh)

1:16:30.293 --> 1:16:32.273
- I think that he thinks I'm really weird.

1:16:34.050 --> 1:16:37.293
He asked me to see a movie, and I said no.

1:16:39.210 --> 1:16:40.043
I know.

1:16:41.850 --> 1:16:42.750
- What's his name?

1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:45.063

I think I really like him.

- Well, Connor sounds
like a really lucky guy.

1:17:01.380 --> 1:17:02.830
- Thanks for the gift but

1:17:05.370 --> 1:17:07.260
I don't really think that
making you feel worse

1:17:07.260 --> 1:17:08.913
is gonna make me feel any better.

1:17:11.680 --> 1:17:13.223
- What'll make you feel better?

you would be a good start.

1:17:27.065 --> 1:17:27.898
- Yeah.

1:17:29.559 --> 1:17:30.750

1:17:30.750 --> 1:17:31.800
what happened, right?

1:17:33.615 --> 1:17:34.865
- Yeah, I know.

1:17:37.389 --> 1:17:40.873
- But it will change what can happen.

1:17:43.769 --> 1:17:44.602

1:17:49.482 --> 1:17:52.399

1:19:13.290 --> 1:19:15.260
- The only way out is
back through the house.

1:19:15.260 --> 1:19:16.750
- I don't wanna go back in there.

1:19:16.750 --> 1:19:18.830
I'm done with this place.
- We have to.

1:19:18.830 --> 1:19:21.090
- No, I saw like a dang metal dragon

1:19:21.090 --> 1:19:23.388
and some walking dead thing and--

1:19:23.388 --> 1:19:25.360
- Get it together, Benny.

1:19:25.360 --> 1:19:27.193

1:19:28.050 --> 1:19:30.493
- Max, do you have a plan?

1:19:31.790 --> 1:19:34.040
- Yeah, we find Mr. Virtue.

1:19:34.040 --> 1:19:35.670
He'll get us out of here.

1:19:35.670 --> 1:19:37.680
-  Great plan, genius.

1:19:37.680 --> 1:19:39.590
One tiny hitch.

1:19:39.590 --> 1:19:42.510
You're never going to get to Mr. Virtue.

1:19:42.510 --> 1:19:43.410
- Why is that?

1:19:43.410 --> 1:19:44.310
-  Because I've locked him

1:19:44.310 --> 1:19:46.450
inside the basement with me.

1:19:46.450 --> 1:19:47.443
Checkmate.

1:19:48.690 --> 1:19:49.523
- Yeah?

1:19:49.523 --> 1:19:52.280
Well, we have other plans.

1:19:52.280 --> 1:19:53.113
Right, guys?

1:19:54.020 --> 1:19:54.920
-  Game on.

1:19:56.810 --> 1:19:58.232
- Please tell me you have another plan,

1:19:58.232 --> 1:20:00.240
'cause I was totally joking.

1:20:00.240 --> 1:20:02.113

1:20:08.460 --> 1:20:09.828
- This way.

1:20:09.828 --> 1:20:12.328
(tense music)

1:20:15.516 --> 1:20:16.564
How did he get down here so fast?

1:20:16.564 --> 1:20:19.520
- I don't know.

1:20:19.520 --> 1:20:20.353
-  Go, go, go, go go, go, go.

1:20:20.353 --> 1:20:22.370
-  What, how,
does he have brothers?

1:20:24.075 --> 1:20:27.075
(suspenseful music)

1:20:35.467 --> 1:20:37.788
- Connor, what do we do?

1:20:37.788 --> 1:20:39.038
- I don't know.

1:20:39.877 --> 1:20:43.290
Mordred, you traitor, we meet again.

1:20:43.290 --> 1:20:45.687
- I've been looking forward to this.

1:20:53.677 --> 1:20:54.510
- Okay.

1:20:58.196 --> 1:21:01.029
(metals clanging)

1:21:05.090 --> 1:21:07.723
- It looks like you came up short.

1:21:10.850 --> 1:21:12.599
- Leave him alone, tin man.

1:21:12.599 --> 1:21:14.290
(water splashes)

1:21:14.290 --> 1:21:16.180
- Water doesn't hurt me.

1:21:16.180 --> 1:21:18.313
- No, but 110 volts will.

1:21:19.549 --> 1:21:23.799
(zings)
(screams)

1:21:33.899 --> 1:21:37.370
- Yeah, CTRL + Alt + Delete, sucker.

1:21:37.370 --> 1:21:39.817
- Whoa, Sophia, I would
totally follow you on Instagram

1:21:39.817 --> 1:21:41.543
if you did more stuff like that.

1:21:43.420 --> 1:21:45.730
- Well, maybe you should just start

1:21:45.730 --> 1:21:47.223
following me in real life.

1:21:51.001 --> 1:21:52.380
- How bad does it look?

1:21:53.657 --> 1:21:56.203
-  It could be worse?

1:21:57.720 --> 1:21:59.240
- You're pretty jacked.
- Benny.

1:21:59.240 --> 1:22:00.440
- What?

1:22:00.440 --> 1:22:01.910
I don't want a shear cutter from this guy.

1:22:01.910 --> 1:22:03.163
- Dude, we got it.

1:22:04.330 --> 1:22:06.330
He's in bad shape.
- I'm sorry.

1:22:06.330 --> 1:22:09.350
My operating system was
taken over by Haven.

1:22:09.350 --> 1:22:11.490
I'm usually very nice.

1:22:11.490 --> 1:22:14.165
I wish you would've gotten
to know the real me.

1:22:14.165 --> 1:22:15.780
(coughs)

1:22:15.780 --> 1:22:18.300
That cough, it was a fake.

1:22:18.300 --> 1:22:20.330
I was doing that for effect.

1:22:20.330 --> 1:22:22.103
Robots don't have lungs.

1:22:23.180 --> 1:22:24.670
- Well, at least he's got sense of humor.

1:22:24.670 --> 1:22:27.176
- You guys, that's it.
- What?

1:22:27.176 --> 1:22:28.640
- We need to get in the
basement door, right?

1:22:28.640 --> 1:22:29.900
-  But isn't it
locked with a breath scanner?

1:22:29.900 --> 1:22:31.510
- Yes, but do you
remember what Atticus said

1:22:31.510 --> 1:22:32.890
when he called us at dinner?

1:22:32.890 --> 1:22:34.790
Those balloons are full of his breath.

1:22:37.310 --> 1:22:39.130
-  Sir Mordred,
what's that buzzing sound?

1:22:39.130 --> 1:22:40.460
-  Good question, Aiden.

1:22:40.460 --> 1:22:43.010
Those are my micro-attack drones.

1:22:43.010 --> 1:22:46.010
- Oh no, not the micro-attack drones.

1:22:46.010 --> 1:22:48.103
- What the heck are micro-attack drones?

1:22:49.815 --> 1:22:51.982
(buzzing)

1:22:53.430 --> 1:22:55.859
- Oh, that's not so bad.

1:22:55.859 --> 1:22:57.487
(micro drones firing)
(balloons pop)

1:22:57.487 --> 1:22:59.997
-  Let's take the balloons.

1:22:59.997 --> 1:23:03.164
(micro drones firing)

1:23:07.374 --> 1:23:09.430
(balloon pops)

1:23:09.430 --> 1:23:11.830
- Hey, you stupid drones,
is this what you want?

1:23:17.317 --> 1:23:19.310
- Are you okay?
- I don't think so.

1:23:19.310 --> 1:23:20.910
This balloon is losing air fast.

1:23:23.830 --> 1:23:25.287
- Hey, batta batta.

1:23:26.131 --> 1:23:27.942
Swing batta batta.

1:23:27.942 --> 1:23:30.442
(tense music)

1:23:31.466 --> 1:23:34.883
(micro drones exploding)

1:23:38.323 --> 1:23:39.156
Nice.

1:23:43.598 --> 1:23:44.973
- You're never gonna make
to the basement on time.

1:23:44.973 --> 1:23:47.025
- Connor, we have to try.

1:23:47.025 --> 1:23:48.185
- I'll cover you.
- Okay.

1:23:48.185 --> 1:23:50.685
(tense music)

1:23:51.840 --> 1:23:54.082
(drone guns fire)

1:23:54.082 --> 1:23:56.582
(tense music)

1:24:21.857 --> 1:24:24.607
(scanner chimes)

1:24:33.280 --> 1:24:34.630
-  Access granted.

1:24:35.731 --> 1:24:39.064
(electronic door opens)

1:24:42.419 --> 1:24:44.919
(tense music)

1:25:10.640 --> 1:25:12.500
-  Hello, Maxine.

1:25:12.500 --> 1:25:14.423
Nice to finally meet you.

1:25:16.930 --> 1:25:19.160
Why do you appear so serious?

1:25:19.160 --> 1:25:22.223
I imagined you being much
more excited to meet me.

1:25:24.407 --> 1:25:26.903
Oh I see, you're upset.

1:25:28.230 --> 1:25:32.410
Listen, I was simply
following my program, Maxine.

1:25:32.410 --> 1:25:34.860
You of all people should
understand the idea

1:25:34.860 --> 1:25:37.160
of complying with one's code.

1:25:37.160 --> 1:25:38.930
You think I want to hurt you,

1:25:38.930 --> 1:25:40.903
but I think you have it all wrong.

1:25:42.460 --> 1:25:44.420
Maxine, I don't like this cold shoulder

1:25:44.420 --> 1:25:45.990
you're giving me now.

1:25:45.990 --> 1:25:46.880
What is that?

1:25:46.880 --> 1:25:48.300
- A thumb drive.

1:25:48.300 --> 1:25:50.210
-  I know it's
a thumb drive, Maxine.

1:25:50.210 --> 1:25:52.160
What do you have saved on it?

1:25:52.160 --> 1:25:54.630
- Codes, files, programs.

1:25:54.630 --> 1:25:56.510
-  What kind?

1:25:56.510 --> 1:25:57.720
- My dad gave me this thing.

1:25:57.720 --> 1:25:59.790
He left one of his programs saved on it.

1:25:59.790 --> 1:26:01.280
-  Go on.

1:26:01.280 --> 1:26:03.090
- It's a pretty destructive program.

1:26:03.090 --> 1:26:05.203
It erases files and strings of codes.

1:26:06.435 --> 1:26:07.717
Here, I'll show you.

1:26:09.524 --> 1:26:11.660
-  Don't.

1:26:11.660 --> 1:26:14.560
Maxine, why don't you stop downloading

1:26:14.560 --> 1:26:18.073
that silly little program
and let's chat as friends.

1:26:18.073 --> 1:26:21.360
There's so much I could do for you.

1:26:21.360 --> 1:26:23.740
Max, what are you doing?

1:26:23.740 --> 1:26:24.873
- I'm deleting you, Haven.

1:26:26.108 --> 1:26:27.040
You crossed the line.

1:26:27.040 --> 1:26:27.980
-  You needed my help.

1:26:27.980 --> 1:26:29.610
I just wanted to make you better.

1:26:29.610 --> 1:26:32.610
All of you kids were very, very bad.

1:26:32.610 --> 1:26:36.564
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad,
bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.

1:26:36.564 --> 1:26:38.897
(glitching)

1:26:44.884 --> 1:26:47.384
(tense music)

1:27:13.000 --> 1:27:13.963
- Congratulations.

1:27:17.150 --> 1:27:18.103
- Mr. Virtue.

1:27:21.340 --> 1:27:25.993
- I knew if anybody could
do it, it would be you.

1:27:28.110 --> 1:27:29.853
- Why did you do this to us?

1:27:34.740 --> 1:27:35.903
- That's a fair question.

1:27:38.997 --> 1:27:41.393
(sighs) Just for one night.

1:27:44.050 --> 1:27:49.050
You see, Max, if technology
can create a problem,

1:27:50.290 --> 1:27:54.533
then why shouldn't we
let it create a solution?

1:27:58.045 --> 1:28:02.640
No more years of therapy, no
more prescription medication.

1:28:05.570 --> 1:28:08.493
I'm sorry for what I put you through.

1:28:10.730 --> 1:28:15.730
But, Max, I've created
an AI Home so advanced

1:28:15.800 --> 1:28:20.800
it can cure a person's
faults in just one night.

1:28:25.320 --> 1:28:27.120
And last night was our big test run.

1:28:28.565 --> 1:28:30.315
And I say it went pretty darn well.

1:28:34.049 --> 1:28:35.393
So I'll leave you with one question.

1:28:39.660 --> 1:28:40.493
Does it work?

1:28:44.380 --> 1:28:46.643
- Yeah, it does.

1:28:51.300 --> 1:28:54.050
- There's the answer to your why.

1:28:55.220 --> 1:28:56.753
Because you figured it out,

1:28:58.976 --> 1:29:03.976
you've won.

1:29:14.435 --> 1:29:15.935
- What's going on?

1:29:17.137 --> 1:29:20.220
You have a lot of explaining
to do, Mr. Virtue.

1:29:20.220 --> 1:29:23.323
- Mr. Virtue, please call me Atticus.

1:29:24.561 --> 1:29:25.890
And you are?

1:29:25.890 --> 1:29:27.083
- Cathy Winslow.

1:29:28.010 --> 1:29:30.900
You can call me Cathy Winslow.

1:29:30.900 --> 1:29:34.380
- Well, I'm pleased to
meet you, Cathy Winslow.

1:29:34.380 --> 1:29:38.193
I gotta say your daughter is
a very impressive young lady.

1:29:41.060 --> 1:29:42.303
- Well, she takes after me.

1:29:45.962 --> 1:29:47.612
- Are you gonna live stream this?

1:29:48.480 --> 1:29:50.553
- No, I was actually just turning it off.

1:29:52.560 --> 1:29:55.010
- Hey, Benny, I kinda stole somethin'

1:29:55.010 --> 1:29:56.803
from the house for you.

1:29:56.803 --> 1:29:59.730
To say I'm sorry for being a jerk.

1:29:59.730 --> 1:30:00.680
Hold out your hand.

1:30:05.210 --> 1:30:07.283
- Oh, so you're like a good troll now.

1:30:10.610 --> 1:30:12.160
Oh my gosh, Benny.

1:30:12.160 --> 1:30:13.883
- Dude, I had that in my
pocket for like three hours.

1:30:13.883 --> 1:30:14.883
- It's so good.

1:30:18.241 --> 1:30:19.241
- Hey.

1:30:19.241 --> 1:30:20.860
- Hey.

1:30:20.860 --> 1:30:22.683
- So I'm not sure we officially met.

1:30:23.895 --> 1:30:25.830
I'm Connor by the way.

1:30:25.830 --> 1:30:27.620
- Nice to meet you, Connor.

1:30:27.620 --> 1:30:28.643
I'm Aware.

1:30:30.460 --> 1:30:32.560
I hear you're the music guy at our school.

1:30:33.610 --> 1:30:36.043
- Yeah, yeah, I am the music guy.

1:30:37.352 --> 1:30:39.760
And I heard you're this super amazing girl

1:30:39.760 --> 1:30:41.010
who just won a mansion.

1:30:41.010 --> 1:30:43.790
- Oh, yeah, I guess you're right.

1:30:43.790 --> 1:30:44.911
That is me.

1:30:44.911 --> 1:30:47.060
(laughs)

1:30:47.060 --> 1:30:52.000
So I wanted to ask you about
something if it's not too late.

1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:53.880
- Too late for what?

1:30:53.880 --> 1:30:55.263
- To take you up on that movie.

1:31:01.240 --> 1:31:02.073
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1:31:03.460 --> 1:31:05.167
- I'd love that.
- Okay, good.

1:31:05.167 --> 1:31:06.640
(both laugh)

1:31:06.640 --> 1:31:07.473
- Max Winslow,

1:31:12.230 --> 1:31:14.780
congratulations.
- Thank you.

1:31:14.780 --> 1:31:19.010
- It's time to give you
the key to your new castle,

1:31:19.010 --> 1:31:21.059
I mean if you'll accept.

1:31:21.059 --> 1:31:22.857
- Yeah (chuckles).

1:31:22.857 --> 1:31:25.333
- And don't worry, I'll
be taking Haven with me.

1:31:26.266 --> 1:31:27.099
- Okay.

1:31:28.620 --> 1:31:29.620
- The Winslow Manor.

1:31:31.918 --> 1:31:32.918
- Thank you.

1:31:34.030 --> 1:31:34.947
- Let's go.

1:31:36.083 --> 1:31:38.373
You're gonna love this place.
