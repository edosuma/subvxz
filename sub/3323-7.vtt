That doesn't exactly qualify
as a minor injury.

I don't know, anything.
There's a gas leak, a fire, whatever.

filled with cop cars, it'll take off.

kills every cop in sight, including my dad?

- Yeah, and Derek had to be shot

slow him down, you remember that?

- Yes.
- I saw him, too.

36:34.485 --> 36:36.100
What about the janitor?

36:36.320 --> 36:37.526
We're still looking.

36:37.738 --> 36:39.274
Did you Check under the bleachers?
Under them?

36:39.490 --> 36:40.775
Yeah, Scott, we looked.

36:41.158 --> 36:43.615
We pulled them outjust like you asked,
there's nothing.

36:43.827 --> 36:44.782
I'm not making this up.

36:44.995 --> 36:46.735
I know, I believe you, I do.

36:46.997 --> 36:48.612
No, you don't.

36:48.832 --> 36:51.790
You have this look
like you feel bad for me.

36:52.002 --> 36:54.334
Like you want to believe me,
but I know you don't.

36:55.839 --> 36:56.794
(SIGHS)

36:56.965 --> 36:58.751
Listen to me.

36:59.635 --> 37:02.297
We're gonna search this whole school.
We're gonna find him.

37:02.638 --> 37:03.798
Okay?

37:04.014 --> 37:05.299
I promise.

37:06.350 --> 37:07.886
MAN: Sheriff!

37:08.852 --> 37:10.968
Stay. Both of you.

37:14.108 --> 37:16.850
Well, we survived, dude.
You know?

37:17.069 --> 37:18.650
We outlasted the Alpha.

37:18.862 --> 37:20.693
It's still good, right? Being alive?

37:21.865 --> 37:24.982
When we were in the chemistry room,
he walked right by us.

37:25.202 --> 37:26.658
You don't think that it heard us?

37:26.870 --> 37:28.826
You don't think it knew
exactly where we were?

37:29.123 --> 37:32.331
- Well, then how come we're still alive?
- It wants me in its pack.

37:32.876 --> 37:34.036
(SIGHS)

37:35.838 --> 37:38.045
But I think, first...

37:38.298 --> 37:40.505
I have to get rid of my Old pack.

37:43.470 --> 37:45.256
What do you mean? What Old pack?

37:47.057 --> 37:50.094
Allison. Jackson, Lydia.

37:52.271 --> 37:53.351
You.

38:01.113 --> 38:03.229
The Alpha doesn't want to kill us.

38:08.078 --> 38:09.739
He wants me to do it.

38:13.709 --> 38:15.791
And that's not even the worst part.

38:16.211 --> 38:19.703
How in holy hell
is that not the worst part, Scott?

38:19.923 --> 38:22.084
Because when he made me shift...

38:25.262 --> 38:26.763
I wanted to do it.

38:30.058 --> 38:31.639
I wanted to kill you.

38:33.937 --> 38:35.313
All of you.

39:01.632 --> 39:02.963
There you are.

39:03.175 --> 39:04.460
How...

39:05.177 --> 39:07.418
- How did you...
- Get out?

39:07.638 --> 39:09.174
Not easily.

39:09.389 --> 39:12.096
And from what they tell me,
I'm alive because of you.

39:12.768 --> 39:14.133
I think I owe you a raise.

39:14.353 --> 39:15.718
(CHUCKLES)

39:16.271 --> 39:18.478
Guys, come on, let's let
the EMTs do their job.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.271
You can talk to him later.

39:23.320 --> 39:24.605
Allison!

39:27.616 --> 39:29.152
Are you okay?

39:29.368 --> 39:31.404
My dad's on his way.

39:31.620 --> 39:34.077
You need... You need anything from me?

39:34.289 --> 39:36.245
- Want me to go with you?
- NO.

39:36.458 --> 39:37.789
I don't.

39:38.377 --> 39:39.412
Okay.

39:40.754 --> 39:43.587
And I also don't know
what happened to you in there.

39:43.799 --> 39:45.585
I don't know what you were thinking.

39:45.801 --> 39:47.757
Maybe you weren't, but...

39:50.722 --> 39:53.464
Right now, I don't...
I don't feel like I can trust you.

39:56.228 --> 39:57.388
Allison, I can explain.

39:57.604 --> 39:59.105
- I don't care.
- Okay, don't say anything else, please,

39:59.314 --> 40:00.178
- just don't say anything...
- Scott, I...

40:00.399 --> 40:01.605
Allison, just stop.

40:01.817 --> 40:03.273
Please, just don't say anything.

40:03.652 --> 40:04.767
Stiles' dad is gonna give me a ride home.

40:04.945 --> 40:06.606
I need to make sure
my mom isn't freaking out.

40:06.822 --> 40:09.234
I'm gonna get a new phone
tomorrow morning, and...

40:09.449 --> 40:10.404
- Scott...
- I'm gonna get a new phone,

40:10.617 --> 40:11.527
and I'm gonna give you a call...

40:11.743 --> 40:12.778
Don't.

40:13.453 --> 40:14.738
What?

40:14.955 --> 40:16.491
Don't call.

40:20.544 --> 40:21.784
Just...

40:21.962 --> 40:23.918
Just please don't call me.

40:24.840 --> 40:26.421
