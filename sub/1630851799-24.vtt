00:00.918 --> 00:02.876
- Tonight "The Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills"

00:02.876 --> 00:04.501
reunion concludes.

00:04.501 --> 00:06.292
- And you kept pushing,
and you kept pushing

00:06.292 --> 00:07.626
and worrying about yourself.

00:07.626 --> 00:10.459
- I wasn't worried
about only myself.

00:10.459 --> 00:13.501
- But I just--what did I say?
- "Crystal, you were quiet.

00:13.501 --> 00:16.834
"Kyle, you were a kiss-ass.
Dorit, you were duplicitous.

00:16.834 --> 00:19.918
Why didn't any of you
ask the tough question?"

00:19.918 --> 00:22.167
Who believes Erika
did not know anything

00:22.167 --> 00:24.000
about what Tom was doing?

00:24.000 --> 00:25.792
- Can someone please
back me up the (BLEEP) up

00:25.792 --> 00:27.334
on what I'm saying?

00:27.334 --> 00:33.167
- It lands differently when
there are air-crash victims.

00:33.167 --> 00:35.542
- It's not doing any favors
with Instagram.

00:35.542 --> 00:36.751
- It's feeding the fire.

00:36.751 --> 00:40.542
- Again, here you are looking
at me rolling your eyes.

00:40.542 --> 00:42.667
- You're a piece of work.

00:42.667 --> 00:44.209
- I loved my husband.

00:44.209 --> 00:46.042
Now, he's allegedly
defrauding widows,

00:46.042 --> 00:47.501
orphans, and burn victims.

00:47.501 --> 00:49.417
How the (BLEEP)
do you think I feel?

00:49.417 --> 00:53.417
- You asked him if he did it?
- I asked him why am I--

00:53.417 --> 00:55.417
why--

00:55.417 --> 00:58.042
[tense music]

00:58.042 --> 01:04.542
â™ª

01:04.542 --> 01:07.667
[intriguing music]

01:07.667 --> 01:09.417
- Who believes Erika did not

01:09.417 --> 01:11.209
know anything
about what Tom was doing?

01:11.209 --> 01:12.542
- I don't think she knew.
- I--I've never thought

01:12.542 --> 01:13.918
that she knew.
- I really never thought

01:13.918 --> 01:15.250
that she knew.
- I never thought she knew.

01:15.250 --> 01:16.667
- I don't think Tom Girardi
told her anything.

01:16.667 --> 01:18.876
- But I--I have a question
which has bothered me.

01:18.876 --> 01:21.167
Where's your anger towards him?

01:21.167 --> 01:23.542
- You think I don't have any
because you haven't seen it?

01:23.542 --> 01:24.834
- No, I'm just asking.
- Or I haven't shown enough

01:24.834 --> 01:26.209
----ing anger here today?

01:26.209 --> 01:29.626
What do you want me to do?
I'm very angry.

01:29.626 --> 01:37.751
Hear it in my voice, all right?
Am I angry now enough for you?

01:37.751 --> 01:39.417
- When the women
ask you questions

01:39.417 --> 01:42.167
that seem fairly reasonable,
you lash out at them.

01:42.167 --> 01:44.125
- Absolutely, I'm lashing out
at everyone, Andy.

01:44.125 --> 01:45.792
And why wouldn't I?

01:45.792 --> 01:49.209
- But if people don't
understand what's going on,

01:49.209 --> 01:52.417
then why isn't it normal
for them to ask the question?

01:52.417 --> 01:55.751
- Because I tell you the truth.
- I understand, but you're--

01:55.751 --> 01:57.417
you're biting
people's heads off--

01:57.417 --> 02:00.167
- If you were being accused
of doing all of these things--

02:00.167 --> 02:02.501
- I would be furious--
- Then thank you.

02:02.501 --> 02:05.417
- But if it was my friends
asking me, I would try

02:05.417 --> 02:07.959
to make them understand
without isolating them.

02:07.959 --> 02:09.709
- Well,
I haven't isolated them.

02:09.709 --> 02:11.918
- You just bit
Crystal's head off.

02:11.918 --> 02:13.751
- She just told me
I wasn't angry enough.

02:13.751 --> 02:15.876
- She was asking you
if you're angry at him

02:15.876 --> 02:17.667
because she didn't know.

02:17.667 --> 02:19.000
- Because she didn't feel it.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.834
- No, because you haven't--
- No, because we didn't see it.

02:20.834 --> 02:22.250
- No, because I have--
hold on a second.

02:22.250 --> 02:24.250
Because I haven't shown it
in the way

02:24.250 --> 02:25.667
that everyone wants me to?

02:25.667 --> 02:28.918
- It's not about
how everyone wants you to.

02:28.918 --> 02:30.834
It's about
what people's understanding is.

02:30.834 --> 02:32.834
- So now it's too much?
- I'm just saying

02:32.834 --> 02:35.083
I don't think these women are
asking you questions

02:35.083 --> 02:36.334
in a way
that they're against you.

02:36.334 --> 02:37.584
- I do.
- I think they're trying--

02:37.584 --> 02:38.626
- You do?
- You do?

02:38.626 --> 02:39.626
- I think some are
and some aren't.

02:39.626 --> 02:41.000
Look, at Kyle's dinner,

02:41.000 --> 02:43.667
I was very controlled
about what I said.

02:43.667 --> 02:46.626
I found out we have $50 to
$80 million cash that's gone.

02:46.626 --> 02:48.876
We did?
That was in "The LA Times"

02:48.876 --> 02:50.626
article
that you so thoroughly read.

02:50.626 --> 02:54.501
And I was very hurt
by what I saw you say--

02:54.501 --> 02:56.125
I don't believe it,
I'm not buying it.

02:56.125 --> 02:58.417
- It looks fishy.

02:58.417 --> 03:00.459
Erika made a deal
with the devil,

03:00.459 --> 03:05.083
and the devil always
comes knocking.

03:05.083 --> 03:08.209
- How do you think
that makes me feel?

03:08.209 --> 03:11.209
You guys know me.
You can read all of it.

03:11.209 --> 03:12.626
Talk to me about it.

03:12.626 --> 03:14.834
[all speaking at once]
- We've tried.

03:14.834 --> 03:16.292
- We have questions, and
I don't want you to take that

03:16.292 --> 03:17.667
as not caring about you.

03:17.667 --> 03:20.375
- We tried.
- But then when we do,

03:20.375 --> 03:21.626
this is the reaction.

03:21.626 --> 03:24.834
And I have to tell you,
you have bitten their head off.

03:24.834 --> 03:26.876
- Dorit, would you like
to be called a liar?

03:26.876 --> 03:28.542
- No, of course not.
- Would you like to be

03:28.542 --> 03:31.542
in the position I am, where
I am getting sued every day

03:31.542 --> 03:33.959
for all of these
incredible things

03:33.959 --> 03:37.125
and be constantly piled on,
and the people closest to you

03:37.125 --> 03:38.959
are, like, well,
you made a deal with the devil.

03:38.959 --> 03:41.083
Well, we don't know.
Well, there's this--

03:41.083 --> 03:42.375
like, hold on you guys.
- But she's not the person

03:42.375 --> 03:44.125
closest to you,
she's not, okay?

03:44.125 --> 03:46.000
She said it.
- No, but you are,

03:46.000 --> 03:48.334
and you and your husband
and you and your husband

03:48.334 --> 03:50.000
were just
having a great old time

03:50.000 --> 03:51.792
laughing at my ----ed up life.

03:51.792 --> 03:54.000
- We don't know what he had.
- Let's not do the prank.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.125
Let's focus on the act, right?
- [laughs]

03:56.125 --> 03:58.918
- He's not
a ----ing soccer player.

03:58.918 --> 03:59.918
He's a lawyer.

03:59.918 --> 04:01.542
- No, we weren't.
- No, and I--

04:01.542 --> 04:02.959
First of all, I want
to apologize for that dinner...

04:02.959 --> 04:03.959
- You did.
- But I can't control

04:03.959 --> 04:05.250
what comes out of their mouths.

04:05.250 --> 04:06.083
I really can't
and I felt very bad.

04:06.083 --> 04:07.459
- And you know what?
I can't control

04:07.459 --> 04:09.042
what Tom Girardi did, okay?

04:09.042 --> 04:09.918
- I know--we all know that.
- Yes, yes, but--

04:09.918 --> 04:13.459
- Everybody knows that.
- Or did not do.

04:13.459 --> 04:15.083
- When it first came out,
ladies,

04:15.083 --> 04:16.584
that people were alleging

04:16.584 --> 04:19.876
that Erika's divorce
was somehow a sham,

04:19.876 --> 04:21.918
what was going
through your minds?

04:21.918 --> 04:23.501
- I never thought
the divorce was a sham.

04:23.501 --> 04:24.709
- I didn't either.
- Right.

04:24.709 --> 04:26.083
- No, I definitely
never thought that.

04:26.083 --> 04:28.459
- And then when you heard about
what Tom was allegedly doing?

04:28.459 --> 04:29.751
- Shocking.
- This was the thing, we--

04:29.751 --> 04:31.667
- Shocking.
- The "LA Times" article

04:31.667 --> 04:34.250
that we talk about--and no,
that wasn't the gospel.

04:34.250 --> 04:37.876
It was just the first time
that we had learned

04:37.876 --> 04:42.584
about totally new developments
about these alleged atrocities.

04:42.584 --> 04:44.542
Erika left.
She wasn't there.

04:44.542 --> 04:46.083
All of a sudden,
this article came out

04:46.083 --> 04:47.834
and we're all trying
to process it.

04:47.834 --> 04:50.209
- I think I'm gonna home.

04:50.209 --> 04:53.167
Got some things I need
to take care of anyway.

04:53.167 --> 04:54.918
- Yeah.

04:54.918 --> 04:56.792
- The Boeing victims
were not paid.

04:56.792 --> 04:58.209
There's not only orphans
involved,

04:58.209 --> 04:59.751
there's a burn victim.

04:59.751 --> 05:02.542
- 'Cause it said that he's
been running his business

05:02.542 --> 05:04.626
like a Ponzi scheme.

05:04.626 --> 05:08.125
It was less than 24 hours
that Sutton had asked

05:08.125 --> 05:09.334
to meet at my house.

05:09.334 --> 05:10.751
And there were--
emotions were high

05:10.751 --> 05:11.959
because we didn't
have the answers.

05:11.959 --> 05:14.751
Everything I believed
about Erika's life

05:14.751 --> 05:16.792
is actually
the diametrical opposite.

05:16.792 --> 05:19.000
- I don't want my name
in an article

05:19.000 --> 05:21.209
that's associated with Erika.

05:21.209 --> 05:23.042
- I'm here
if you've lost all your money,

05:23.042 --> 05:24.292
I'm here
if your husband cheated on you,

05:24.292 --> 05:26.709
but if there's any connection,
you know--

05:26.709 --> 05:27.709
- Yes, like, (BLEEP) you.
- Like, if you knew

05:27.709 --> 05:30.834
what was going on here,
I need to know that.

05:30.834 --> 05:33.292
- And your reaction
to that meeting was what?

05:33.292 --> 05:36.292
- Why didn't you have me there?
You should have had me there.

05:36.292 --> 05:38.250
- So Dorit brings up
a good point,

05:38.250 --> 05:40.459
which is that you had just
left them--

05:40.459 --> 05:43.292
- Yeah, so it's easier
to talk behind my back

05:43.292 --> 05:45.542
instead of including me
in a conversation about--

05:45.542 --> 05:47.918
- Well, but it's also hard
when you left,

05:47.918 --> 05:50.417
because of something I asked,
and then yet--

05:50.417 --> 05:53.083
so therefore, do we come
back to you and ask again?

05:53.083 --> 05:54.459
I don't even think
anybody thought

05:54.459 --> 05:56.709
about bringing you in honestly.

05:56.709 --> 05:58.542
- Kenny from New Orleans said,

05:58.542 --> 06:00.751
"Erika, you said
you live off credit cards.

06:00.751 --> 06:03.417
"When did you realize Tom was
having money troubles?

06:03.417 --> 06:04.834
Was one of your cards
rejected?"

06:04.834 --> 06:07.542
- Um, in 2020, yeah.
I was on Broadway.

06:07.542 --> 06:08.751
- You were on Broadway?
- Yeah.

06:08.751 --> 06:10.334
- And were you like--

06:10.334 --> 06:11.626
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:11.626 --> 06:12.959
- Did any of you hear that Tom

06:12.959 --> 06:15.375
was having money problems
before?

06:15.375 --> 06:17.125
- Um, I had heard something.

06:17.125 --> 06:18.375
Yeah.
- You had?

06:18.375 --> 06:19.542
- Yeah,
but I didn't know if it's true,

06:19.542 --> 06:21.042
like everything else.
- Go ahead and say what it is.

06:21.042 --> 06:22.459
- Andy knows as much as I do.

06:22.459 --> 06:25.501
- What do you know?
- Sorry, Andy.

06:25.501 --> 06:26.667
- We had heard something

06:26.667 --> 06:28.709
from the same person
a few years ago.

06:28.709 --> 06:30.000
- And what was it?

06:30.000 --> 06:32.292
- That he was
in financial trouble.

06:32.292 --> 06:33.751
- Why wouldn't you come to me
and tell me?

06:33.751 --> 06:35.083
- I thought it was
gossip honestly,

06:35.083 --> 06:36.626
'cause, like,
they seem fine to me.

06:36.626 --> 06:37.792
- It didn't even register
like--I was like--

06:37.792 --> 06:40.292
- Right, to a lot of people
it didn't register also.

06:40.292 --> 06:43.626
When the firm filed
and when everything happened,

06:43.626 --> 06:44.959
there were many lawyers
that would call me and say,

06:44.959 --> 06:47.083
God, I thought
Girardi Keese was healthy.

06:47.083 --> 06:48.584
- Many questions wanting
to know

06:48.584 --> 06:52.000
how are you paying right now
for your glam.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.542
- You just told me
you paid me a lot of money--

06:53.542 --> 06:54.751
earlier segment.
- So that's--

06:54.751 --> 06:57.083
- So there you go.
- I know what you make

06:57.083 --> 06:59.709
on this show.

06:59.709 --> 07:00.876
It ain't bad.
Okay--

07:00.876 --> 07:02.709
- Yeah, you just told me
you paid me a lot of money.

07:02.709 --> 07:03.959
- So you're spending
your money--

07:03.959 --> 07:05.792
- Like everyone else here, yes.
- Right.

07:05.792 --> 07:09.167
Um, there were a lot of people
on Twitter,

07:09.167 --> 07:12.792
including Camille Grammer, who
think that you deliberately

07:12.792 --> 07:16.959
chose not to wear waterproof
mascara on your hike with Kyle.

07:16.959 --> 07:18.959
- Sorry, I know there's
snot coming out my nose.

07:18.959 --> 07:21.125
I don't even care anymore.

07:21.125 --> 07:22.959
- [sighs]
Erika.

07:22.959 --> 07:24.459
- [sighs]

07:24.459 --> 07:25.501
- Jamie from Albany said,

07:25.501 --> 07:28.334
"I'm not buying the pity party
or your acting.

07:28.334 --> 07:30.918
"We all know you always
wear waterproof mascara.

07:30.918 --> 07:32.918
"Did you skip it
because you were going

07:32.918 --> 07:33.918
for the sympathy vote?"

07:33.918 --> 07:35.167
- No, absolutely not.

07:35.167 --> 07:37.000
And that's not true at all.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.584
- Do you always wear
waterproof mascara,

07:38.584 --> 07:39.667
as someone
who knows nothing about it?

07:39.667 --> 07:40.918
- Yes, I always do

07:40.918 --> 07:42.626
because I have allergies
with my eyes.

07:42.626 --> 07:44.125
And that day I did not.

07:44.125 --> 07:46.292
And you can see me
patting my face.

07:46.292 --> 07:47.918
Look, if I--
if I rub my face,

07:47.918 --> 07:50.834
it's gonna be all--
I'm gonna have a black face.

07:50.834 --> 07:51.959
But that is not true.

07:51.959 --> 07:54.083
And I don't need
anyone's sympathy.

07:54.083 --> 07:55.626
And I don't need anyone's pity.

07:55.626 --> 07:57.709
And I certainly don't need
someone from the side

07:57.709 --> 07:59.334
who's no longer on this show

07:59.334 --> 08:01.626
to put in their two cents,
okay?

08:01.626 --> 08:03.959
- I agree with that.
- Let me be very clear here.

08:03.959 --> 08:05.792
That happened.
It was--

08:05.792 --> 08:07.334
you know, look,
I didn't want it to happen.

08:07.334 --> 08:09.501
- Why did you not wear
waterproof mascara

08:09.501 --> 08:10.709
on that day if you always--

08:10.709 --> 08:12.751
- I was gonna say you have
many different makeup artists.

08:12.751 --> 08:13.626
So maybe that day--
- It was just--

08:13.626 --> 08:16.375
it was a fluke
and that is all it was.

08:16.375 --> 08:20.792
And I'm not looking
for the sympathy vote.

08:20.792 --> 08:24.334
- Lots of reports
about Tom being disbarred

08:24.334 --> 08:26.042
by the California
Federal Court.

08:26.042 --> 08:27.042
- Yes.
- He's moved

08:27.042 --> 08:28.626
to an assisted living facility.

08:28.626 --> 08:31.125
Have you spoken to him?
- Yes.

08:31.125 --> 08:33.375
- And?
- Very sad.

08:33.375 --> 08:36.459
Yeah.

08:36.459 --> 08:40.584
- Um, what is the tenor
of those conversations?

08:40.584 --> 08:50.292
- I just wanted to make su--
[voice cracks]

08:50.292 --> 08:55.209
I just wanted to make sure
he was safe.

08:55.209 --> 08:58.209
Because after the pictures
came out, he looked so bad,

08:58.209 --> 09:00.125
that I just wanted
to make sure

09:00.125 --> 09:03.125
he was in the right place.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.125
Guess what?
I got on waterproof mascara.

09:05.125 --> 09:10.542
- Going back to your
interaction with Garcelle.

09:10.542 --> 09:12.000
- He does?
- He does?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.167
- If you don't mind me saying,

09:13.167 --> 09:15.375
Tom calls her.

09:15.375 --> 09:16.459
- Well,
I do mind you saying that,

09:16.459 --> 09:18.792
'cause I feel like you're
betraying my friendship

09:18.792 --> 09:20.709
right now, but please,
have your moment.

09:20.709 --> 09:22.167
- Erika.

09:22.167 --> 09:24.709
- Why did you get upset
with Garcelle sharing

09:24.709 --> 09:26.375
that Tom calls you
with the group,

09:26.375 --> 09:30.375
when you had shared it
while mic'd and on camera?

09:30.375 --> 09:32.417
- Not on camera.
The cameras were down.

09:32.417 --> 09:33.918
- Okay.
- So we were talking,

09:33.918 --> 09:36.751
and this again goes to the sham

09:36.751 --> 09:39.667
that, you know,
I could not answer those calls

09:39.667 --> 09:41.459
because people would say
why are you--

09:41.459 --> 09:43.167
- That you were in cahoots
with him.

09:43.167 --> 09:45.501
Of course, so that's
why I blew up at Garcelle.

09:45.501 --> 09:47.250
- Because you did not
want people

09:47.250 --> 09:49.042
to have the impression
that you two--

09:49.042 --> 09:51.584
- That we were--yeah.
And I had not spoken to him

09:51.584 --> 09:53.417
until he went
into the care facility.

09:53.417 --> 09:57.709
- How many times
have you spoken with him?

09:57.709 --> 09:59.918
- You know, he calls every day.

09:59.918 --> 10:01.042
- Still?

10:01.042 --> 10:03.334
- He's called five times today.
- [gasps]

10:03.334 --> 10:05.542
- Really?
- Yeah, sitting right here.

10:05.542 --> 10:07.834
- Have you expressed your anger
with him...

10:07.834 --> 10:09.042
- Yes, I have.
- When you speak to him?

10:09.042 --> 10:11.042
- I've asked him how he could
put me in this position.

10:11.042 --> 10:15.292
- Have you asked him
if he did it?

10:15.292 --> 10:23.792
- I asked him why am I--
why--

10:23.792 --> 10:25.250
[choking up]
Why would you--

10:25.250 --> 10:27.209
- It's okay.

10:27.209 --> 10:28.626
- It's not okay.

10:28.626 --> 10:31.209
[dramatic music]

10:31.209 --> 10:36.626
Why would you leave me...

10:36.626 --> 10:44.209
With millions of dollars
in lawsuits pointed at me?

10:44.209 --> 10:45.375
- Coming up.

10:45.375 --> 10:46.417
You hired security?

10:46.417 --> 10:48.375
- For a week, I did, yeah.

10:48.375 --> 10:51.125
You said you were gonna come
after me and my family.

10:51.125 --> 10:53.250
- You came after me
and my family,

10:53.250 --> 10:53.250
so you can get pushed
right back on.

10:53.250 --> 11:00.876
- Tonight "The Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills"

11:00.876 --> 11:03.709
[downtempo music]

11:03.709 --> 11:05.125
- Have you asked him
if he did it?

11:05.125 --> 11:07.876
- [choking up]
I asked him why would you--

11:07.876 --> 11:09.918
- It's okay.

11:09.918 --> 11:12.292
- It's not okay.
- Yeah.

11:12.292 --> 11:15.584
- Why would you leave me

11:15.584 --> 11:21.125
with millions of dollars
of lawsuits pointed at me?

11:21.125 --> 11:23.751
- Did you ask him if he...

11:23.751 --> 11:24.792
- Andy.
- Stole from these people?

11:24.792 --> 11:32.792
- Andy, he doesn't even
acknowledge anything.

11:32.792 --> 11:36.375
None of it.

11:36.375 --> 11:37.584
[sniffles]

11:37.584 --> 11:39.167
It doesn't even matter
what he says,

11:39.167 --> 11:44.751
'cause he's incompetent.

11:44.751 --> 11:47.667
So I'm left
holding the ----ing bag.

11:47.667 --> 11:49.709
- Oh, ----ing hell.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.584
So he doesn't even acknowledge
that he has these lawsuits

11:52.584 --> 11:53.584
or these things are going on?

11:53.584 --> 11:56.876
He's not capable
of understanding any of it?

11:56.876 --> 12:01.083
- Not when I've pressed.

12:01.083 --> 12:10.417
And I probably shouldn't even
be telling you that.

12:10.417 --> 12:12.459
Go ahead.
What else?

12:12.459 --> 12:15.959
- The big bombshell
in the "LA Times" article,

12:15.959 --> 12:18.626
that $20 million
was transferred.

12:18.626 --> 12:20.834
- It was not.

12:20.834 --> 12:22.876
- There was not
$20 million transferred...

12:22.876 --> 12:24.459
- EJ Global.
- Into your company...

12:24.459 --> 12:26.792
- That is correct.
- EJ Global, as a loan?

12:26.792 --> 12:27.792
- That is correct.
- From Tom's law firm.

12:27.792 --> 12:30.709
- It was not $20 million.
No.

12:30.709 --> 12:34.209
My lawyer wrote to "Page Six"
to "E" and everybody else,

12:34.209 --> 12:39.167
but somehow or another
that doesn't seem to be told.

12:39.167 --> 12:42.375
- You spent $14 million
on your American Express bill?

12:42.375 --> 12:43.417
- Over 12 years.

12:43.417 --> 12:45.584
So if you knock that down
to 2 million per year,

12:45.584 --> 12:47.542
that's pretty much
what we're all doing this year.

12:47.542 --> 12:50.125
I mean, doing on the--
in this lifestyle.

12:50.125 --> 12:53.918
- That $14 million that's been
reported is over 12 years?

12:53.918 --> 12:56.417
- That is correct.
- Okay.

12:56.417 --> 13:01.000
So the allegation is that
the money that we have seen

13:01.000 --> 13:06.501
you spending was money
that Tom stole from others,

13:06.501 --> 13:08.834
and your reaction to that is?

13:08.834 --> 13:11.792
- This is a very
long bankruptcy

13:11.792 --> 13:15.083
that will be pulled apart,
both his firm

13:15.083 --> 13:16.501
and his personal bankruptcy.

13:16.501 --> 13:18.459
I am not in bankruptcy.

13:18.459 --> 13:21.751
I am being sued
by everyone who thinks I've got

13:21.751 --> 13:24.417
some magical pot of gold
at some rainbow.

13:24.417 --> 13:26.834
I have no idea.
But wait a second.

13:26.834 --> 13:28.375
If that is proven,

13:28.375 --> 13:32.375
what money was allegedly
misappropriated when, how?

13:32.375 --> 13:35.083
Does that mean every lawyer's
salary should be clawed back?

13:35.083 --> 13:37.209
Does that mean
every secretary's salary

13:37.209 --> 13:38.501
needs to be clawed back?

13:38.501 --> 13:40.000
Or the referring attorneys

13:40.000 --> 13:42.501
or anyone else
that's in that business?

13:42.501 --> 13:46.167
So that's a big thing to lay
out there that requires--

13:46.167 --> 13:47.584
- But then why was it ruled

13:47.584 --> 13:49.250
that you could be roped
into this?

13:49.250 --> 13:51.042
- I don't know, you know?

13:51.042 --> 13:52.834
I'm--
I would have to ask my lawyer--

13:52.834 --> 13:54.626
- Because you're his wife.
- It's pretty important.

13:54.626 --> 13:57.501
- It's one more of the ----ing
stack of sh-- I have.

13:57.501 --> 13:59.167
- What about the mistresses
that he was giving money to?

13:59.167 --> 14:00.375
- Yeah, what about them?

14:00.375 --> 14:01.709
Should we go get the money
out of their ass?

14:01.709 --> 14:04.083
I don't know.
- You said that Tom started

14:04.083 --> 14:06.584
making bad decisions
three years ago

14:06.584 --> 14:08.834
after his car accident,

14:08.834 --> 14:13.042
but "The LA Times" claim that
his alleged wrongdoing spanned

14:13.042 --> 14:15.083
over a decade before that.

14:15.083 --> 14:17.459
- That would be long
before I'm on the show.

14:17.459 --> 14:19.083
- But I mean,
I'm not talking about you

14:19.083 --> 14:20.459
on the show or anything,
I'm just saying--

14:20.459 --> 14:22.167
- I'm just saying
I wouldn't know.

14:22.167 --> 14:23.709
I am no doctor--
- Yes.

14:23.709 --> 14:24.918
- All right?
Three years ago,

14:24.918 --> 14:26.876
he had a terrible,
terrible head injury.

14:26.876 --> 14:29.501
- Really?
- There was a significant shift

14:29.501 --> 14:33.501
in his personality, his
decision-making, and who he is.

14:33.501 --> 14:36.792
- People thought that you were
manipulating the narrative

14:36.792 --> 14:40.000
by saying that the cognitive
decline started three years ago

14:40.000 --> 14:42.584
and that you were
somehow connecting

14:42.584 --> 14:47.542
the cognitive decline with him
allegedly ripping off people.

14:47.542 --> 14:49.042
- No, I'm simply just saying--
- You were not?

14:49.042 --> 14:50.167
- No.
What I'm saying is--

14:50.167 --> 14:52.542
I'm just simply telling you
what I've experienced.

14:52.542 --> 14:55.334
- Okay.
Had anyone heard any rumors

14:55.334 --> 14:57.834
of Tom's corruption
before this?

14:57.834 --> 14:59.501
- I hadn't.
all: No.

14:59.501 --> 15:00.751
- And had you?
- No.

15:00.751 --> 15:02.918
By all accounts,
this was an upstanding man

15:02.918 --> 15:07.334
in the community that was doing
well, winning awards still.

15:07.334 --> 15:09.000
What are we supposed
to believe, Andy?

15:09.000 --> 15:11.167
- Right, right, right.
I have to assume

15:11.167 --> 15:15.542
that if you thought that Tom
was involved in any impropriety

15:15.542 --> 15:17.375
that had to do with the money
you were spending,

15:17.375 --> 15:19.918
you would not have come out
with the song, "XXPEN$IVE."

15:19.918 --> 15:22.501
- I wouldn't have been
on a reality TV show.

15:22.501 --> 15:24.876
- That's what I thought.
- Okay, let's be clear here.

15:24.876 --> 15:26.918
I'm not--
[scoffs]

15:26.918 --> 15:28.542
[both chuckle]

15:28.542 --> 15:29.918
- You're smart.
You wouldn't be here.

15:29.918 --> 15:31.292
- But I wouldn't.
- I know.

15:31.292 --> 15:33.459
- 'Cause you can't hide sh--
like this.

15:33.459 --> 15:34.876
- Mm-hmm.
- That's what I'm saying.

15:34.876 --> 15:38.250
This is not some master plan.

15:38.250 --> 15:40.417
This is not, you know,

15:40.417 --> 15:43.501
Erika being some financial
----ing mastermind.

15:43.501 --> 15:47.292
This is a tragic
sequence of events

15:47.292 --> 15:49.584
that are completely terrible.

15:49.584 --> 15:52.000
- Sutton, you said that
one of Tom's former partners

15:52.000 --> 15:56.167
left the firm because
of shady business practices.

15:56.167 --> 16:00.042
- One of the partners
at his law firm left

16:00.042 --> 16:02.959
because his wife
told the partner,

16:02.959 --> 16:05.083
"Honey, something's off."

16:05.083 --> 16:07.209
- Stop it!
- I can't make this up.

16:07.209 --> 16:09.000
That was a rumor
that I had heard.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.042
- I would love
that person's name.

16:11.042 --> 16:13.542
Helps in my investigation.
- I don't know their name.

16:13.542 --> 16:15.667
- But you knew enough
to say it, Sutton.

16:15.667 --> 16:17.626
- I did because I felt--
- But no, hun.

16:17.626 --> 16:19.584
- Yep.
- Just stop for one second.

16:19.584 --> 16:21.167
This is what I'm talking about.

16:21.167 --> 16:23.375
If you're gonna throw it out,
back it up.

16:23.375 --> 16:25.125
Give me the name so I can go.

16:25.125 --> 16:26.292
- It will help you.
- It may help me.

16:26.292 --> 16:27.292
- It would help, yeah.
- Oh, okay.

16:27.292 --> 16:28.709
- Do you see what I'm saying?
- Yeah, sure.

16:28.709 --> 16:30.417
- Help me.
- Okay.

16:30.417 --> 16:33.334
I will.

16:33.334 --> 16:35.459
I will.
- Thank you.

16:35.459 --> 16:37.667
- Going back to the meeting
that the women had

16:37.667 --> 16:40.459
at Dorit's,
was there any one thing

16:40.459 --> 16:42.667
that was said
that surprised you the most?

16:42.667 --> 16:44.417
- No, I think--
I think the thing

16:44.417 --> 16:47.667
that upset me the most was that
why are they immediately

16:47.667 --> 16:51.000
believing all of this stuff
when I'm right here?

16:51.000 --> 16:53.334
You know, I'm here.
The source is here.

16:53.334 --> 16:59.876
And I--I worked really hard
to be open and honest.

16:59.876 --> 17:03.125
And I felt like I was
just getting sh-- on for it.

17:03.125 --> 17:05.751
- But we had never, ever
spoken about the lawsuits.

17:05.751 --> 17:07.834
- But we've never spoken
about your lawsuits either.

17:07.834 --> 17:09.375
- You're involved
in an ongoing lawsuit--

17:09.375 --> 17:11.167
- With Beverly Beach.
Exactly.

17:11.167 --> 17:12.542
- Beverly Beach.

17:12.542 --> 17:13.751
- He wants a certain amount
of money.

17:13.751 --> 17:15.125
And no,
I can't get into numbers,

17:15.125 --> 17:16.709
because
it's an ongoing lawsuit.

17:16.709 --> 17:17.876
- People were afraid
to ask questions--

17:17.876 --> 17:20.125
- You could've talked to me.
- Because you are closed--

17:20.125 --> 17:22.542
- I asked questions.
- But to my face, love.

17:22.542 --> 17:25.459
- I did to your face.
- But not after the meeting.

17:25.459 --> 17:27.417
- It didn't go great when
they did ask you questions.

17:27.417 --> 17:28.709
- Who cares?
- Well--

17:28.709 --> 17:31.000
- What do you want me to do?
- Well, it makes you hesitant.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.000
- It would make them clam up
and not ask anything,

17:33.000 --> 17:34.626
I would think.

17:34.626 --> 17:36.000
- We're talking about
heavy sh--, right?

17:36.000 --> 17:37.209
- Yeah.
- What do you want me to do?

17:37.209 --> 17:38.209
Like, I'm very human.

17:38.209 --> 17:40.501
- Well, it's the heavy sh--
that we were worried about.

17:40.501 --> 17:42.667
- But wait a minute.
At Christmas dinner,

17:42.667 --> 17:43.876
I didn't do enough.

17:43.876 --> 17:45.667
- Everybody was, like, wait--
- Right.

17:45.667 --> 17:47.209
- Do you know where
that money's coming from?

17:47.209 --> 17:51.125
- That's another question
as well that we will uncover.

17:51.125 --> 17:52.375
- Okay.

17:52.375 --> 17:54.042
- I clearly wasn't
angry enough,

17:54.042 --> 17:55.876
I wasn't mad enough,

17:55.876 --> 18:02.751
so I cannot win here.

18:02.751 --> 18:04.083
- Coming up.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.792
- I am an adult.
- Well, you know what?

18:05.792 --> 18:07.125
- What?
- It didn't seem like that.

18:07.125 --> 18:07.125
- And it felt like you were
being a bitchy ----ing (BLEEP).

18:07.125 --> 18:18.584
[downtempo music]

18:18.584 --> 18:21.292
- At Christmas dinner,
I didn't do enough.

18:21.292 --> 18:24.626
At Christmas dinner,
I clearly wasn't angry enough.

18:24.626 --> 18:26.292
I wasn't mad enough.

18:26.292 --> 18:28.375
So I cannot win here.

18:28.375 --> 18:31.000
- Wait, here or out there?
Because you're saying that--

18:31.000 --> 18:32.209
- Both.
- None of us said

18:32.209 --> 18:33.209
that you're not angry--

18:33.209 --> 18:35.250
- Both--she just said
I'm not angry enough.

18:35.250 --> 18:37.042
- No, I said--
- She asked if you were

18:37.042 --> 18:38.167
angry at Tom.

18:38.167 --> 18:40.167
- Very.
- I just didn't know that.

18:40.167 --> 18:43.375
That's--
it's a reasonable question.

18:43.375 --> 18:45.501
- Listen, if we are
gonna get together,

18:45.501 --> 18:47.042
talking behind people's back--

18:47.042 --> 18:48.125
- Never works.
- Never works.

18:48.125 --> 18:49.292
- I mean, Rinna.

18:49.292 --> 18:52.042
- Well, but it's true.
I know it better than anybody.

18:52.042 --> 18:55.250
True Munchausen Syndrome
wherein those affected

18:55.250 --> 18:58.292
feign disease, illness,
or psychological trauma.

18:58.292 --> 19:01.626
I would say she's probably
mostly sober right now.

19:01.626 --> 19:04.000
They're this close
to Kim dying.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.250
- Wow.

19:05.250 --> 19:07.167
- Denise didn't show up
on Saturday night.

19:07.167 --> 19:11.334
The first post is the picture
that Aaron posted of her

19:11.334 --> 19:15.209
in a hospital bed
with six hernias.

19:15.209 --> 19:16.709
That is called
a sympathy post.

19:16.709 --> 19:17.959
I know how this game works.

19:17.959 --> 19:21.334
- If you care so much about
Erika, why were you pushing

19:21.334 --> 19:23.626
Sutton to say things
that would hurt Erika?

19:23.626 --> 19:26.334
- All I said was
if we're gonna get together--

19:26.334 --> 19:29.000
you said, if Erika walked
in this room right now,

19:29.000 --> 19:30.167
I would say it
right to her face.

19:30.167 --> 19:33.125
So I was just like,
she's here, say it to her face.

19:33.125 --> 19:34.209
That's all.
- And I did.

19:34.209 --> 19:35.876
- And did you give her
a heads up about...

19:35.876 --> 19:37.042
- Yes.
- What she was walking into?

19:37.042 --> 19:39.042
- I did.

19:39.042 --> 19:40.417
- Sutton was the one
who called the meeting.

19:40.417 --> 19:43.167
She was the one
who had legal concerns.

19:43.167 --> 19:45.626
She's the one who took charge
of this whole thing.

19:45.626 --> 19:48.250
And yes, we all had questions.
And you know, I said--

19:48.250 --> 19:50.000
[all speaking at once]

19:50.000 --> 19:52.125
- Well,
Mary from Long Island said,

19:52.125 --> 19:54.042
"I'm so disappointed
in so many of you

19:54.042 --> 19:55.959
"when it comes
to questioning Erika.

19:55.959 --> 19:57.876
"Crystal, you were quiet.

19:57.876 --> 20:01.083
"Kyle, you were a kiss-ass.
Dorit, you were duplicitous.

20:01.083 --> 20:03.292
Why didn't any of you
ask the tough questions?"

20:03.292 --> 20:06.042
- I asked, I said, did you know
any of this before?

20:06.042 --> 20:08.042
I asked so many questions
that I felt bad.

20:08.042 --> 20:10.918
The obvious question is,
did you know any of this?

20:10.918 --> 20:12.501
- No, I did not.
- And that's what I said.

20:12.501 --> 20:15.083
- But you never
accused me of lying.

20:15.083 --> 20:16.959
- Never.
- And that was my big issue.

20:16.959 --> 20:20.083
That's why I had
such a breakdown at Kathy's.

20:20.083 --> 20:22.125
You know me.
You can pick up the phone,

20:22.125 --> 20:25.876
and you--you can say,
girl, what the (BLEEP)?

20:25.876 --> 20:28.375
- Got it.

20:28.375 --> 20:30.042
- We talked about this--
- What?

20:30.042 --> 20:31.876
- No, I was just wondering
if you apolog--

20:31.876 --> 20:33.167
if you apologized to her.

20:33.167 --> 20:34.751
- For what?
- For that dinner at Kathy's.

20:34.751 --> 20:36.334
- No.
- You're not going to?

20:36.334 --> 20:39.000
- Not tonight.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.250
What am I apologizing for,
Garcelle?

20:40.250 --> 20:42.083
Sticking up for myself?
- For threatening her.

20:42.083 --> 20:45.083
- For threatening her
and being so vicious.

20:45.083 --> 20:46.918
- You said, I'm gonna come
after you, you said Tom was--

20:46.918 --> 20:48.167
- Do you know what I mean
by that?

20:48.167 --> 20:49.167
Do you know
what I mean by that?

20:49.167 --> 20:50.209
Let me explain.

20:50.209 --> 20:52.042
- I don't think anybody knew
what you meant.

20:52.042 --> 20:54.042
- Okay.
Well, I'm about to tell you.

20:54.042 --> 20:58.501
Everyone on this show knows
that the longer you stay on,

20:58.501 --> 21:01.292
everyone goes through
their own personal stuff.

21:01.292 --> 21:03.083
And when it's your turn,

21:03.083 --> 21:05.626
I will not give you the grace
that I asked for.

21:05.626 --> 21:07.334
That's what that means.

21:07.334 --> 21:09.209
And I happen to be the one
getting it this year,

21:09.209 --> 21:11.250
but you could be the one
getting it next year.

21:11.250 --> 21:12.417
- That is--
- I got it--

21:12.417 --> 21:14.209
- That's--
- I got it this year.

21:14.209 --> 21:16.125
- That's really not
how it came off.

21:16.125 --> 21:17.209
- No.

21:17.209 --> 21:22.250
- You ever call me a liar
again, I'm coming for you.

21:22.250 --> 21:23.918
But that's how I meant it.

21:23.918 --> 21:25.167
- But we don't know that
though.

21:25.167 --> 21:28.292
- Look again, here you are
looking at me rolling your eyes

21:28.292 --> 21:30.167
not believing me,
and that's okay too.

21:30.167 --> 21:32.000
- I'm just saying
it's not how it came off.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.209
- It didn't seem like that.
- Well, it doesn't matter.

21:33.209 --> 21:35.125
And that's exactly what it is.
- And that's a really--

21:35.125 --> 21:37.876
- Had you said that, I think
that would have been easier

21:37.876 --> 21:40.167
to digest than
"I'm coming for you."

21:40.167 --> 21:42.959
"I'm coming for you"--
- I'm coming for you is slang.

21:42.959 --> 21:44.417
- Yeah, it is.
- It can mean many things.

21:44.417 --> 21:46.792
- But with the intent and the--
- It means--

21:46.792 --> 21:49.042
- And your menacing eyes--
- You said, "And your family."

21:49.042 --> 21:50.876
- And you're so angry,
it didn't feel like--

21:50.876 --> 21:52.125
- It was scary for you.

21:52.125 --> 21:53.083
Right, it was scary--
- It was scary for everybody.

21:53.083 --> 21:55.626
- And in any other city,
it'd have been a conversation.

21:55.626 --> 21:57.042
- It was scary to watch.
- It's scary.

21:57.042 --> 21:58.042
- Oh, please.
- Yeah!

21:58.042 --> 21:59.083
- In Potomac,
it'd have been a conversation.

21:59.083 --> 22:01.000
In Atlanta, it'd have
been in a conversation.

22:01.000 --> 22:03.000
In New York, it would have
been a conversation.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.083
It's only in Beverly Hills...
- What does that mean?

22:04.083 --> 22:08.125
- That everybody's so precious.
- [laughs]

22:08.125 --> 22:09.042
- (BLEEP).

22:09.042 --> 22:12.250
- Queens of Bravo tweeted
some photos of Erika yelling

22:12.250 --> 22:15.042
at Sutton from Kathy's party
with the caption,

22:15.042 --> 22:18.417
"And not once was she called
a bully by anyone."

22:18.417 --> 22:19.250
- Agreed.
- Garcelle.

22:19.250 --> 22:21.334
You'd retweeted this
with a thank you.

22:21.334 --> 22:23.501
Should someone have
called out Erika

22:23.501 --> 22:25.167
for being a bully that night?

22:25.167 --> 22:27.125
- Absolutely.
Absolutely.

22:27.125 --> 22:29.876
That's one of my
biggest regrets that night,

22:29.876 --> 22:32.125
and it haunted me
and it still haunts me

22:32.125 --> 22:33.167
that I didn't stop it,

22:33.167 --> 22:35.167
that I didn't do something
to say--

22:35.167 --> 22:37.375
- And what would you have said?
- Enough.

22:37.375 --> 22:40.375
Enough,
and I felt like

22:40.375 --> 22:43.792
I should have
tried to intervene,

22:43.792 --> 22:48.125
to deescalate the situation,
because it was a lot.

22:48.125 --> 22:51.334
- Elva from Bakersfield said
that if she had been threatened

22:51.334 --> 22:53.959
like that,
she would've hired security.

22:53.959 --> 22:55.000
Sutton, were you scared?
- I did.

22:55.000 --> 22:55.834
- You did?
- She did.

22:55.834 --> 22:57.584
- Absolutely.
- You hired security?

22:57.584 --> 23:00.250
- For--
for a week I did, yeah.

23:00.250 --> 23:02.042
- What's your reaction to that?

23:02.042 --> 23:03.250
- [laughs]
- I don't know what--

23:03.250 --> 23:05.125
I don't know what
she's gonna do.

23:05.125 --> 23:06.459
- Oh, okay.

23:06.459 --> 23:08.459
- We're in
a Joe Pesci movie now.

23:08.459 --> 23:11.459
- You said you were gonna
come after me and my family.

23:11.459 --> 23:13.292
- You came after me
and my family,

23:13.292 --> 23:15.250
so you can get pushed
right back on.

23:15.250 --> 23:17.459
- That's not an okay way
to speak to people.

23:17.459 --> 23:19.209
- And it's not okay
to call someone a liar.

23:19.209 --> 23:21.000
And it's not okay
to say someone made a deal

23:21.000 --> 23:22.876
with the devil,
and it's not okay to say--

23:22.876 --> 23:24.417
- Well, you know what?
I have my opinion.

23:24.417 --> 23:26.417
- And I have mine, and it--
- But--okay.

23:26.417 --> 23:27.876
- No, you're not
going to do this.

23:27.876 --> 23:29.083
- Then talk about it
like an adult.

23:29.083 --> 23:30.042
- I am an adult.

23:30.042 --> 23:31.292
- Well, you know what?
- What?

23:31.292 --> 23:34.167
- It didn't seem like that
at that table.

23:34.167 --> 23:35.250
- And it didn't--
and it felt like you were

23:35.250 --> 23:39.959
being a bitchy ----ing (BLEEP).

23:39.959 --> 23:42.167
Okay?
That's what it felt like.

23:42.167 --> 23:45.209
[dramatic music]

23:45.209 --> 23:46.167
- Coming up next...

23:46.167 --> 23:50.042
The level of questioning
of Lisa Vanderpump regarding--

23:50.042 --> 23:51.542
- But she ran away
and I didn't.

23:51.542 --> 23:51.542
She couldn't answer the bell.
I ----ing did.

23:51.542 --> 24:00.459
- At Christmas dinner,
I didn't do enough.

24:00.459 --> 24:03.375
- You said you were gonna
come after me and my family.

24:03.375 --> 24:05.167
- It's not okay
to call someone a liar.

24:05.167 --> 24:07.959
- I have my opinion.
- And I have mine.

24:07.959 --> 24:09.209
- Then talk about it
like an adult.

24:09.209 --> 24:10.417
- I am an adult.

24:10.417 --> 24:12.459
- It didn't seem like that
at that table.

24:12.459 --> 24:13.876
- And it felt like
you were being

24:13.876 --> 24:17.250
a bitchy ----ing (BLEEP).

24:17.250 --> 24:19.459
Okay?
That's what it felt like.

24:19.459 --> 24:22.125
That you could not understand
the position I'm in,

24:22.125 --> 24:24.083
and you kept pushing,
and you kept pushing

24:24.083 --> 24:25.459
and worrying about yourself.

24:25.459 --> 24:27.042
And that's not what needed
to happen.

24:27.042 --> 24:30.542
- Actually, I wasn't worried
about only myself.

24:30.542 --> 24:33.417
I wasn't seeing you worried
about the victims at all.

24:33.417 --> 24:35.042
- You don't know that.

24:35.042 --> 24:36.167
You're assuming that.
- That's right.

24:36.167 --> 24:38.083
- What would I have needed
to do?

24:38.083 --> 24:40.250
- You were only
throwing insults at me.

24:40.250 --> 24:43.209
You weren't taking any kind
of conversations with me--

24:43.209 --> 24:45.209
- I'm not going
to be called a liar.

24:45.209 --> 24:46.083
- Well,
if you would talk to me,

24:46.083 --> 24:48.959
then maybe you could
convince me that you weren't.

24:48.959 --> 24:51.125
- I'm not a liar.
I don't need to convince you.

24:51.125 --> 24:52.250
- How do I know this?
- I'm not going to sit--

24:52.250 --> 24:54.334
- I don't know you that well.
- At a dinner table and be--

24:54.334 --> 24:56.334
You don't know me well enough
to say I'm a liar.

24:56.334 --> 25:00.334
- I was looking at the facts.
- What facts?

25:00.334 --> 25:02.167
- I was reading "The LA Times."
- Really?

25:02.167 --> 25:04.167
20 million did not go
into my account,

25:04.167 --> 25:06.000
so you shouldn't
jump to conclusions.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.209
"Erika's a liar.
Erika's inconsistent.

25:08.209 --> 25:09.459
Erika's at fault."
- Well--

25:09.459 --> 25:11.459
- Well, I'm not.
- Listen.

25:11.459 --> 25:14.000
You know what you did
in Del Mar?

25:14.000 --> 25:15.125
- What?

25:15.125 --> 25:16.334
- You pretended
to be my friend.

25:16.334 --> 25:22.584
- [sighs]
It's just been raw, honey.

25:22.584 --> 25:24.501
- I know, I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

25:24.501 --> 25:27.250
It's okay.

25:27.250 --> 25:29.167
I'll get through it.

25:29.167 --> 25:31.334
But I had to lash out,
and I apologize.

25:31.334 --> 25:33.417
And you pretended to be mine.

25:33.417 --> 25:36.417
- No, actually, I thought
that you were being sincere.

25:36.417 --> 25:40.959
And you know what that is?
Lying.

25:40.959 --> 25:44.125
- No, that's actually
just playing your ass.

25:44.125 --> 25:46.167
- Tell me why
being called a liar is--

25:46.167 --> 25:47.959
is such a big trigger--

25:47.959 --> 25:49.125
- Because this is a big deal
in my life.

25:49.125 --> 25:50.292
- It's a strong word.

25:50.292 --> 25:52.542
- It's a pretty dangerous
moment to be called a liar.

25:52.542 --> 25:54.083
- This is a very
vulnerable moment.

25:54.083 --> 25:55.042
- If you think about it.

25:55.042 --> 25:57.375
- That had big consequences
outside of it.

25:57.375 --> 26:00.167
Look, I had never told
that story about Tom

26:00.167 --> 26:04.042
and his car accident to anyone.

26:04.042 --> 26:06.501
As a result of the crash,
his ankle was broken.

26:06.501 --> 26:07.375
- Right.
Got it, got it, got it.

26:07.375 --> 26:10.167
- He was also unconscious
for 12 hours...

26:10.167 --> 26:11.083
- He was?

26:11.083 --> 26:14.542
- So when I tell it and
I'm called a liar about it--

26:14.542 --> 26:15.626
- Well, you did.

26:15.626 --> 26:17.459
You said
that he broke his ankle...

26:17.459 --> 26:19.042
- He did break his ankle.
- And that was it.

26:19.042 --> 26:21.042
- No.
- Just because you didn't say

26:21.042 --> 26:24.083
that he had the brain thing
at the same time,

26:24.083 --> 26:26.000
that is still lying.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.918
- No, it's not.
- That's a strong word though.

26:27.918 --> 26:29.042
- It is protecting--
- I'm not sure it's lying.

26:29.042 --> 26:30.167
It's omitting.
- It's not--hold on.

26:30.167 --> 26:32.042
It is not omitting.
- You said that your marriage

26:32.042 --> 26:34.542
was perfect
when he was having affairs.

26:34.542 --> 26:36.209
- My marriage was not perfect.
- And it's okay.

26:36.209 --> 26:38.167
The thing is, Erika,
sometimes it's okay

26:38.167 --> 26:39.042
to lie
when you're protecting some--

26:39.042 --> 26:40.417
- I'm not lying.
- I get that.

26:40.417 --> 26:41.918
- And first off,
you weren't even

26:41.918 --> 26:44.000
in our group years ago
when that happened.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.167
- I know,
but you told the story.

26:45.167 --> 26:47.083
- You're saying
you just left things out?

26:47.083 --> 26:48.959
- Do you know why?
- Yes, you were protecting.

26:48.959 --> 26:51.167
- And I--that's okay.
And that's okay.

26:51.167 --> 26:53.125
- That's not a lie.

26:53.125 --> 26:55.209
- If you don't know
that you're protecting--

26:55.209 --> 26:57.459
- I could no longer protect--
hold on.

26:57.459 --> 27:01.334
Once Tom's counsel had said
he's incompetent,

27:01.334 --> 27:04.292
I came with the whole story,
okay?

27:04.292 --> 27:06.375
And by the way,
when she asked me

27:06.375 --> 27:08.584
a question I couldn't answer,
even though we're close,

27:08.584 --> 27:10.042
I said, I can't tell you.

27:10.042 --> 27:12.042
- I said, okay.

27:12.042 --> 27:13.918
- Well, Robbie
from Redondo Beach said,

27:13.918 --> 27:16.167
"Rinna, you said
Erika shouldn't be questioned

27:16.167 --> 27:19.125
"because she's dealing
with something serious.

27:19.125 --> 27:21.918
"Yolanda's health
and Kim's addiction

27:21.918 --> 27:26.042
"and Denise's marriage were all
pretty serious in my eyes,

27:26.042 --> 27:28.959
"but now with Erika,
it's crickets.

27:28.959 --> 27:31.459
Did aliens take over your body?
Please explain yourself."

27:31.459 --> 27:34.083
- No, aliens have not
taken over my body.

27:34.083 --> 27:36.042
- Okay, but this is
a really important point.

27:36.042 --> 27:37.083
- I'm gonna--
I'm gonna say this.

27:37.083 --> 27:39.083
I'm gonna say number one,

27:39.083 --> 27:42.042
I feel horrible about
what happened with Yolanda.

27:42.042 --> 27:44.209
- Munchausen disease,

27:44.209 --> 27:49.167
that was the biggest ----ing
blow I've ever had in my life.

27:49.167 --> 27:50.042
- And I'm sorry about that.

27:50.042 --> 27:53.209
And it didn't come from me--
- Sorry is not enough.

27:53.209 --> 27:55.626
You put it out into
the universe and that sucks.

27:55.626 --> 28:01.459
- I regret that.
That was wrong on every level.

28:01.459 --> 28:03.083
And I'm really sorry
that that happened.

28:03.083 --> 28:03.834
- Okay.

28:03.834 --> 28:05.292
- I wish I could
take that back.

28:05.292 --> 28:07.167
I feel horrible about that.

28:07.167 --> 28:09.959
- Okay.
- Kim,

28:09.959 --> 28:12.584
I also feel that
it wasn't my place to do that.

28:12.584 --> 28:17.167
- You told Eden
that I am near death,

28:17.167 --> 28:19.417
that I am not in a good place.

28:19.417 --> 28:22.501
That is so treacherous.
- Well, Kim, you have to know

28:22.501 --> 28:25.501
that I have only wanted
to move on with you.

28:25.501 --> 28:30.250
You know, I hope in the end,
maybe it helped in some way.

28:30.250 --> 28:33.417
I don't feel good about that
either really in the long run.

28:33.417 --> 28:36.918
And with Denise, I don't like
how that went down either.

28:36.918 --> 28:40.876
You sent a cease and desist.
- Who told you that?

28:40.876 --> 28:44.501
- Oof.
You're so angry.

28:44.501 --> 28:47.250
Denise, you are angry.
- No, you are playing dirty.

28:47.250 --> 28:50.083
- I'm playing dirty?
- Like, this is slanderous.

28:50.083 --> 28:52.375
- All these things,
I really have to be honest,

28:52.375 --> 28:54.459
I don't feel great about.

28:54.459 --> 28:56.083
I did them.

28:56.083 --> 28:58.167
It happened.
They haunt me.

28:58.167 --> 29:02.042
I think each and every one
of them haunts me.

29:02.042 --> 29:04.083
When I think about
those moments and I--

29:04.083 --> 29:06.542
I have to live with myself.

29:06.542 --> 29:11.375
You know, I have to live with
the consequences of my actions.

29:11.375 --> 29:14.083
We all do.
If I could take it back

29:14.083 --> 29:18.709
and not go through
those moments...

29:18.709 --> 29:19.709
To be honest, I would.

29:19.709 --> 29:20.918
I would take each
and every one of them back.

29:20.918 --> 29:25.167
- And following up on that,
Rinna, I mean, as a group,

29:25.167 --> 29:29.292
there was a lot of conversation
about Lisa Vanderpump

29:29.292 --> 29:34.167
and Lucy Lucy Apple Juicy
to the point where you might've

29:34.167 --> 29:37.459
inferred that she stole
from orphans and widows.

29:37.459 --> 29:39.459
- Lisa, why aren't
you upset about this?

29:39.459 --> 29:42.167
- Oh, come on.
- He's your employee.

29:42.167 --> 29:45.125
This wouldn't get out there if
you didn't want it out there.

29:45.125 --> 29:47.459
- Ugh.
- This is, like, bullsh--

29:47.459 --> 29:49.167
going to Teddi,
bringing Kyle in.

29:49.167 --> 29:50.626
This sounds like
a ----ing setup.

29:50.626 --> 29:52.626
- I was--
are you kidding me?

29:52.626 --> 29:54.250
- I'm not kidding you.

29:54.250 --> 29:55.334
- What?
- What?

29:55.334 --> 29:59.083
- I mean, I'm just saying,
the level of questioning

29:59.083 --> 30:00.876
of Lisa Vanderpump
regarding that--

30:00.876 --> 30:02.292
- But she ran away
and I didn't.

30:02.292 --> 30:03.417
- Okay.
- Okay?

30:03.417 --> 30:04.459
- Okay.
- I'm here.

30:04.459 --> 30:06.959
She chose to, like,
not show up.

30:06.959 --> 30:09.876
I showed up today--
as vicious and as angry

30:09.876 --> 30:12.876
and as hurt
and as beat down as I am.

30:12.876 --> 30:15.000
She couldn't answer the bell.
I ----ing did.

30:15.000 --> 30:17.375
- She never answered questions.
- She went away.

30:17.375 --> 30:18.834
- So that's not really...

30:18.834 --> 30:20.209
- Kind of different.
- In my opinion--

30:20.209 --> 30:22.959
- Analogous.
- No.

30:22.959 --> 30:26.042
- We're gonna be right back
after this.

30:26.042 --> 30:27.250
Next.

30:27.250 --> 30:28.876
- Why are you smiling at me?

30:28.876 --> 30:31.125
- Because
you're a piece of work.

30:31.125 --> 30:32.459
- [laughing]
- You are a piece of work.

30:32.459 --> 30:33.417
- I've never met
anyone like you.

30:33.417 --> 30:33.417
- That's saying a lot.
- That's saying a lot.

30:33.417 --> 30:42.667
- You said you were gonna
come after me and my family.

30:42.667 --> 30:45.042
[upbeat music]

30:45.042 --> 30:47.209
- Erika, if you don't mind
putting your phone down.

30:47.209 --> 30:49.417
Thank you so much.
Five, four,

30:49.417 --> 30:53.042
three to the jib, two...

30:53.042 --> 30:54.501
- We are back with more

30:54.501 --> 30:56.667
of the "Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills" reunion.

30:56.667 --> 30:59.083
I'm Andy Cohen.
Winnie from Anchorage said,

30:59.083 --> 31:01.459
"Erika, Sutton was such
a great friend to you.

31:01.459 --> 31:03.459
She flew the women out
to your Broadway debut--"

31:03.459 --> 31:05.083
- Yes, that's why
I don't understand

31:05.083 --> 31:07.209
why she flipped on me
after an article.

31:07.209 --> 31:09.834
Come to me
and talk to me, Andy.

31:09.834 --> 31:12.751
- You wouldn't talk to me.
- You called me a liar.

31:12.751 --> 31:13.834
- I said I don't bel--yeah.
- You came to my house.

31:13.834 --> 31:16.167
You told me that you didn't
want to speak to me,

31:16.167 --> 31:17.584
that you were afraid
to be seen with me.

31:17.584 --> 31:19.083
- I never said
I didn't want to speak to you.

31:19.083 --> 31:20.709
- No, you're worried
about your reputation.

31:20.709 --> 31:21.876
- I didn't say
I didn't want to speak to you.

31:21.876 --> 31:23.000
- You didn't want
to be seen with me.

31:23.000 --> 31:25.167
You called me a liar.
These things are true, yes?

31:25.167 --> 31:26.751
- Here's what I--
- Hello, does anyone else...

31:26.751 --> 31:29.083
- It's all on camera.
- It's all on camera.

31:29.083 --> 31:31.292
- When I said I didn't want
to see you--

31:31.292 --> 31:32.125
[groans]

31:32.125 --> 31:34.459
- It's on camera.
- Can someone please

31:34.459 --> 31:36.375
back me the (BLEEP) up
on what I'm saying?

31:36.375 --> 31:38.209
- I'm not saying
I didn't say those things.

31:38.209 --> 31:39.209
- They're all agreeing
with you.

31:39.209 --> 31:44.042
- We're agreeing with you.

31:44.042 --> 31:45.417
- Why are you smiling at me?

31:45.417 --> 31:47.876
- Because
you're a piece of work.

31:47.876 --> 31:49.250
- [laughing]
- You are a piece of work.

31:49.250 --> 31:52.042
- That's why I'm smiling.
You're something else.

31:52.042 --> 31:54.584
I just--I don't know.
I've never met anyone like you.

31:54.584 --> 31:56.375
- The story I told is true.
- That's saying a lot.

31:56.375 --> 31:58.083
- That's saying a lot.
- [laughs]

31:58.083 --> 31:59.667
- And listen, I understand

31:59.667 --> 32:02.834
that the story I'm telling
is ----ing wild, okay?

32:02.834 --> 32:04.083
I understand.

32:04.083 --> 32:06.042
From the burglary to--

32:06.042 --> 32:07.542
- The cars turning over.

32:07.542 --> 32:09.417
- Well, one--
one car flipped over.

32:09.417 --> 32:11.417
- You said Tom and your son.

32:11.417 --> 32:13.459
- Yes.
One--my son rolled his car.

32:13.459 --> 32:16.209
Tom's was this way
and was away from the car.

32:16.209 --> 32:17.375
- Okay.

32:17.375 --> 32:20.042
- You found him after he was
unconscious for 12 hours?

32:20.042 --> 32:21.542
- Yes.
It's in--it's actually nine,

32:21.542 --> 32:23.083
'cause I went back
and did the math.

32:23.083 --> 32:25.876
It's actually nine.
- Is there a police report?

32:25.876 --> 32:27.375
- They can't find one.

32:27.375 --> 32:30.167
- But he called you
or they found--

32:30.167 --> 32:31.334
you found him?
- No, no, no, no.

32:31.334 --> 32:34.834
I talked to him last
at 9:00 p.m.

32:34.834 --> 32:37.417
He was leaving an event
on the west side.

32:37.417 --> 32:41.542
I did not talk to him again
until 6:00 a.m. in the morning.

32:41.542 --> 32:44.250
After midnight,
something ain't right, okay?

32:44.250 --> 32:46.375
- Right.
- So I kept calling and calling

32:46.375 --> 32:48.125
and calling, no answer,
no answer, no answer,

32:48.125 --> 32:51.584
no answer, no answer, no--
no answer.

32:51.584 --> 32:56.375
At 6:00 a.m., the phone rings,
and it's Tom.

32:56.375 --> 32:57.292
I'm like,
where are you, where are you?

32:57.292 --> 33:00.000
And he goes,
hi, I don't know where I am.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.334
I think I'm on the west side.
- God.

33:02.334 --> 33:04.459
- And the phone disconnects.
- Oh, God.

33:04.459 --> 33:06.083
- Did you do Find My Phone?

33:06.083 --> 33:08.292
- He has a--
all: Flip phone.

33:08.292 --> 33:10.459
- Come on.
Keep up.

33:10.459 --> 33:12.292
- [snorts]

33:12.292 --> 33:15.834
- So then he calls back.
- Oh, God.

33:15.834 --> 33:16.834
- And I go,
hey, what happened?

33:16.834 --> 33:17.959
Where are you?
Where are you?

33:17.959 --> 33:22.042
And he goes, I think I'm close
or in the backyard.

33:22.042 --> 33:25.042
Well, I'm looking at the
backyard and he's not there.

33:25.042 --> 33:27.542
So I go, what do you see?

33:27.542 --> 33:30.000
And he says, I see the bridge.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.667
- Right.
- So that immediately tells me

33:31.667 --> 33:33.792
he's below our house, meaning--

33:33.792 --> 33:35.459
- But did he say,
"I had a car accident"?

33:35.459 --> 33:38.626
- No.
Can I finish my story?

33:38.626 --> 33:39.667
- This is--
- I'm telling you the truth.

33:39.667 --> 33:42.125
- This is why we don't
wanna ask you anything.

33:42.125 --> 33:44.417
- Right, but--
but please don't interrupt me

33:44.417 --> 33:45.751
while I'm try--
because I would--

33:45.751 --> 33:46.667
- Train of thought.
- I don't--yeah.

33:46.667 --> 33:48.125
Look, let me finish up.
- Okay, go ahead.

33:48.125 --> 33:50.834
- So I go down
and I see the car,

33:50.834 --> 33:54.209
tilted, no Tom.

33:54.209 --> 33:56.584
Tom is at the bottom
of the ravine.

33:56.584 --> 33:58.375
911, go to the hospital.

33:58.375 --> 34:00.417
- Why did you say, by the way,

34:00.417 --> 34:02.667
that he was allegedly
unconscious for 12 hours?

34:02.667 --> 34:04.876
- I know he was unconscious
for 12 hours.

34:04.876 --> 34:06.542
I mean, the head injury--
- Allegedly, yeah.

34:06.542 --> 34:09.167
Mm-hmm.
Right, yeah.

34:09.167 --> 34:11.375
'Cause I got in trouble
with my lawyers. [laughs]

34:11.375 --> 34:12.584
- 'Cause you got in trouble
with your lawyers?

34:12.584 --> 34:14.417
- I got in trouble with my
lawyers for talking too much.

34:14.417 --> 34:16.501
Yes.
- Wow.

34:16.501 --> 34:18.417
- Look,
this whole thing is surreal,

34:18.417 --> 34:20.626
but it is completely true.

34:20.626 --> 34:22.334
And by the way, of course.
- Allegedly.

34:22.334 --> 34:24.918
- Why was it snowing
where your son was?

34:24.918 --> 34:27.834
- We're not gonna
get into that.

34:27.834 --> 34:31.125
Let's just focus on the fact
that my child,

34:31.125 --> 34:34.959
not his children, was the one
that went and checked on him,

34:34.959 --> 34:37.501
boarded up the house, and
made sure everything was okay.

34:37.501 --> 34:39.918
- How is your relationship
with his children?

34:39.918 --> 34:44.542
- We do not speak.
Clearly, this is a massive--

34:44.542 --> 34:46.918
- Wedge.
- Yeah, wedge, thank you.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.167
- Um, I--
I know we've covered this,

34:49.167 --> 34:51.125
but I have to keep
going back to it

34:51.125 --> 34:53.751
because it's the big thing

34:53.751 --> 34:55.959
that everybody
is so pissed off about.

34:55.959 --> 34:57.042
- Right.
- Okay?

34:57.042 --> 34:59.751
They are equating
everything you do,

34:59.751 --> 35:03.584
every attitude you have,
every post you make,

35:03.584 --> 35:07.751
they equate it as,
there are victims.

35:07.751 --> 35:10.584
She should be
talking about them.

35:10.584 --> 35:14.334
She should be doing something.
And it just always, it's--

35:14.334 --> 35:16.542
- You know how I can serve
the victims the best?

35:16.542 --> 35:18.667
- Tell me.
- By cooperating in court

35:18.667 --> 35:20.083
and by getting--
rolling up my sleeves

35:20.083 --> 35:21.667
and getting down
to the bottom of it.

35:21.667 --> 35:23.292
And that is what I have done.

35:23.292 --> 35:25.834
Really, if everything is true

35:25.834 --> 35:28.042
that has been alleged,
is how I can help.

35:28.042 --> 35:29.501
- But you can say that,
my darling--

35:29.501 --> 35:31.959
- I just did.
- Now.

35:31.959 --> 35:34.501
But you can say that
and then people will actually--

35:34.501 --> 35:36.209
because that's a beautiful
thing what you just said.

35:36.209 --> 35:37.542
- My lawyer has said that.

35:37.542 --> 35:42.292
And look, Erika has cooperated.

35:42.292 --> 35:44.876
Erika has done
everything she can.

35:44.876 --> 35:51.417
Erika is also being sued
day after day, all right?

35:51.417 --> 35:55.000
- Okay.
Um, well, listen.

35:55.000 --> 35:59.709
You've answered every question,
and I thank you.

35:59.709 --> 36:03.501
And I want to hear
from the women now.

36:03.501 --> 36:07.125
Do you feel that
you heard everything

36:07.125 --> 36:08.209
that you were wondering about?

36:08.209 --> 36:11.751
I mean, I think we all came in
here with a lot of questions.

36:11.751 --> 36:13.751
- I think we definitely--
- I think Erika cleared up

36:13.751 --> 36:15.667
a lot about Tom's accident,
because--

36:15.667 --> 36:17.125
- Yeah, cleared up a lot.

36:17.125 --> 36:18.209
- You know, and things get lost
in translation.

36:18.209 --> 36:20.334
- They do, they do.
- It's like, it was a four--

36:20.334 --> 36:21.667
flipped four times,
the car, five times.

36:21.667 --> 36:23.292
- Well, that was my child
on the way home--

36:23.292 --> 36:25.709
- Right, no, but I'm saying--
- And when you're nervous,

36:25.709 --> 36:28.584
you sometimes say something,
and we all are ADD.

36:28.584 --> 36:30.292
E-F-G.
- Well, I think also too,

36:30.292 --> 36:31.709
it's hard to interpret
sometimes,

36:31.709 --> 36:33.334
and people grab onto
certain things.

36:33.334 --> 36:34.542
- Garcelle.
- Yes? [laughs]

36:34.542 --> 36:36.626
- And that was a lot more clear
to me, Tom's accident.

36:36.626 --> 36:41.209
- Is there anything else
that is unanswered?

36:41.209 --> 36:42.918
- No.
I mean, we're never gonna

36:42.918 --> 36:45.083
get anywhere between them two,
you know?

36:45.083 --> 36:46.876
Um, that's the only thing.

36:46.876 --> 36:48.834
- Fancy Drew, what about you?
- Yeah.

36:48.834 --> 36:52.417
- No, I mean, I--I asked all of
my questions that I wanted to

36:52.417 --> 36:57.209
face-to-face, so it's nice
to hear more clear answers

36:57.209 --> 37:01.584
or answers at all,
so thank you for answering.

37:01.584 --> 37:04.083
- What about you, Crystal?

37:04.083 --> 37:05.083
- No, I'm done.

37:05.083 --> 37:06.167
- You're good?
- Yeah.

37:06.167 --> 37:07.209
- I'm sorry
I bit your head off.

37:07.209 --> 37:10.375
- It's okay.

37:10.375 --> 37:13.334
- The most important thing
that I heard today

37:13.334 --> 37:18.125
was your expression of sympathy

37:18.125 --> 37:22.417
for the victims
and them needing

37:22.417 --> 37:25.959
to get any rectification
that is due to them.

37:25.959 --> 37:27.417
- That's right.
Absolutely.

37:27.417 --> 37:31.876
The legitimate claims
need to be taken care of.

37:31.876 --> 37:34.292
Can I just say one thing?
- Yes.

37:34.292 --> 37:36.501
- Thank you
for hearing me out today.

37:36.501 --> 37:38.584
This is not pretty.
It is ugly.

37:38.584 --> 37:39.751
I am well aware.

37:39.751 --> 37:43.209
And I have been pressed
for however many months now

37:43.209 --> 37:44.834
and stories have run wild

37:44.834 --> 37:46.417
and people have
filled in the blanks.

37:46.417 --> 37:49.959
I hope today that you all leave
knowing a little bit more

37:49.959 --> 37:53.792
of my side and understand this
will not be wrapped up easily.

37:53.792 --> 37:55.834
It is a long, arduous process.

37:55.834 --> 37:58.959
And all I can do is put
one foot in front of the other.

37:58.959 --> 38:01.042
- Thank you.
That was a lot.

38:01.042 --> 38:02.501
We're gonna--
- Oh, I--

38:02.501 --> 38:04.584
I just want to apologize
to Garcelle.

38:04.584 --> 38:06.167
- You do?
For what?

38:06.167 --> 38:09.501
- Because it wasn't my fault

38:09.501 --> 38:10.959
that I didn't come
to your dinner.

38:10.959 --> 38:13.000
I wasn't allowed
to come to your dinner.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.792
- What?
So who we waiting for?

38:14.792 --> 38:16.542
We're waiting for Kathy.

38:16.542 --> 38:18.000
- She's not coming.
- Oh!

38:18.000 --> 38:19.000
- She's not?
- I'm sorry.

38:19.000 --> 38:20.542
- Oh!
- Are you serious?

38:20.542 --> 38:21.751
- [laughing]
- Yeah, she can't come.

38:21.751 --> 38:22.751
Something came up
with one of her--

38:22.751 --> 38:24.292
- Why didn't she text me?
- Oh.

38:24.292 --> 38:26.000
- That bitch.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.667
- [laughing]
- I've never liked her.

38:28.667 --> 38:30.751
- I wanted to come
to the dinner, but it was--

38:30.751 --> 38:33.334
I was already safe from COVID,

38:33.334 --> 38:36.792
but I had that three-day,
so they wouldn't let me come,

38:36.792 --> 38:39.000
and I thought that
they told you and I was mad.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.709
I said, I'm fine.

38:41.709 --> 38:44.083
But I couldn't come.
- I accept your apology.

38:44.083 --> 38:46.292
- What are your no--
what's your note in your bag?

38:46.292 --> 38:47.209
- That was it.
- They saw it.

38:47.209 --> 38:48.918
It said "Garcelle."
- That was the note.

38:48.918 --> 38:49.918
Oh, I got it.
- Okay.

38:49.918 --> 38:51.167
Now that that's cleared up,

38:51.167 --> 38:54.626
we're gonna be right back
with final thoughts after this.

38:54.626 --> 38:54.626
- And a big fight.
- [chuckles]

38:54.626 --> 39:00.375
[upbeat music]

39:00.375 --> 39:03.209
[hip-hop beat]

39:03.209 --> 39:05.042
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

39:05.042 --> 39:07.167
- You know,
it's just really heated.

39:07.167 --> 39:09.083
- Know that I--
- I know you get it.

39:09.083 --> 39:10.375
- I've always been
supporting you.

39:10.375 --> 39:12.292
- I know you have,
and I really appreciate it.

39:12.292 --> 39:13.792
And I'm very supportive of you.
- And that's why I understand.

39:13.792 --> 39:16.709
But that your fighting
when I defended the liar.

39:16.709 --> 39:18.000
It's like, I get it.
You can bite my head off.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.042
It's okay.
- It's okay.

39:19.042 --> 39:20.292
Don't worry about it.
- Okay.

39:20.292 --> 39:21.959
But I get it.
- It's all good.

39:21.959 --> 39:23.584
- Yeah.
- All right.

39:23.584 --> 39:25.542
We are back
with some final thoughts

39:25.542 --> 39:28.751
for the "Real Housewives
of Beverly Hills."

39:28.751 --> 39:31.501
Sutton,
if you could redo one thing

39:31.501 --> 39:33.042
from this year,
what would it be?

39:33.042 --> 39:37.334
- Well, definitely
my conversation with Crystal.

39:37.334 --> 39:39.751
Just listen.

39:39.751 --> 39:42.125
- Mm.
- Dorit, you're a mom.

39:42.125 --> 39:45.375
You're a fashionista.
You're a chatterbox.

39:45.375 --> 39:48.918
What do you want to be known
for above all?

39:48.918 --> 39:51.501
- Definitely the chatterbox.
[laughter]

39:51.501 --> 39:54.083
- Well, good, 'cause you are.
- Thank you.

39:54.083 --> 39:56.083
I'm proud of it.
- Yeah, right.

39:56.083 --> 39:57.918
- I want be a good mom,
a good wife.

39:57.918 --> 39:59.292
- You are a good mom
and a good wife.

39:59.292 --> 40:01.667
- That's--
that's what I'm most proud of.

40:01.667 --> 40:04.542
- So, Kathy,
what surprised you the most

40:04.542 --> 40:06.626
about joining the group
and this experience?

40:06.626 --> 40:09.334
- I just think
that I was surprised

40:09.334 --> 40:14.459
how real it all was
and what a sisterhood it is,

40:14.459 --> 40:17.918
and how I really adore
all the girls.

40:17.918 --> 40:19.751
It's been fun.
I've had a good time.

40:19.751 --> 40:22.334
- Crystal,
you had a rough entry,

40:22.334 --> 40:24.542
and then you really
loosened up.

40:24.542 --> 40:26.626
You shared so much of yourself.

40:26.626 --> 40:31.042
What did it mean for you to
have this new group of friends?

40:31.042 --> 40:33.125
- It was a tough transition,

40:33.125 --> 40:36.584
but I always kept an open mind
and open heart.

40:36.584 --> 40:41.876
And it was really nice
to end it the way it did.

40:41.876 --> 40:44.667
I want to make a toast
to all of you beautiful ladies

40:44.667 --> 40:47.667
on this Chinese New Year
that I'm just so grateful

40:47.667 --> 40:49.375
to celebrate this year
with you.

40:49.375 --> 40:53.417
This has been truly the most
remarkable year of my life.

40:53.417 --> 40:56.459
And all of you are
in thanks for that.

40:56.459 --> 40:58.584
So cheers.
- And may it be better

40:58.584 --> 41:00.542
than the last,
I'll tell y'all that.

41:00.542 --> 41:03.042
- When I said my speech
of my hope for everybody,

41:03.042 --> 41:05.501
it really rang true.

41:05.501 --> 41:07.459
- Garcelle,
do you leave tonight

41:07.459 --> 41:10.042
feeling like more
of an insider with the group?

41:10.042 --> 41:11.459
- I do, actually.
I do.

41:11.459 --> 41:12.542
- You do?
- I do.

41:12.542 --> 41:15.083
I don't know what it is,
but I do.

41:15.083 --> 41:20.876
- Did you get the resolution
you were looking for today?

41:20.876 --> 41:24.083
- Um, I didn't come in
with a particular--

41:24.083 --> 41:25.751
- Need?
- Yeah.

41:25.751 --> 41:27.417
But I wanted to see
where things go,

41:27.417 --> 41:29.417
and obviously Dorit and I,
you know,

41:29.417 --> 41:30.709
I will say things
directly to her--

41:30.709 --> 41:34.459
even though I felt like I was,
but I will do a better job.

41:34.459 --> 41:36.584
And then Rinna and I are just
gonna move forward.

41:36.584 --> 41:37.667
- Yeah.

41:37.667 --> 41:39.792
Rinna, what's your biggest
takeaway from this year?

41:39.792 --> 41:42.209
I mean, we really saw
a shift in you.

41:42.209 --> 41:43.792
How do you leave this season?

41:43.792 --> 41:46.876
- You know, I did not know
how it would go today.

41:46.876 --> 41:51.501
Last year, I felt like there
wasn't any resolution for me,

41:51.501 --> 41:53.667
and I was not gonna do that
with Garcelle.

41:53.667 --> 41:57.250
So I feel good about
what happened between us.

41:57.250 --> 42:02.292
And I think that what I know
about me is I am a good friend.

42:02.292 --> 42:04.834
- You are.
- I--I'm a good friend.

42:04.834 --> 42:07.334
- You are.
Thank you.

42:07.334 --> 42:10.209
- Erika, your life has been
under a microscope.

42:10.209 --> 42:11.834
There's a Greek chorus
of people

42:11.834 --> 42:13.167
who have a lot of
strong opinions about you.

42:13.167 --> 42:14.250
- Yes.

42:14.250 --> 42:16.542
- What do you hope that
they take away from you?

42:16.542 --> 42:20.876
- I hope for nothing other than
I came here with an open heart.

42:20.876 --> 42:24.751
I honored my commitment.
I stood up for myself.

42:24.751 --> 42:27.042
And that's all I can do.

42:27.042 --> 42:29.334
I appreciate you asking me
the tough questions and--

42:29.334 --> 42:32.751
and letting me,
you know, tell my story.

42:32.751 --> 42:36.167
- Kyle, whether it's with
Kathy or your friends,

42:36.167 --> 42:38.834
do you feel a responsibility
to patch things up

42:38.834 --> 42:42.417
and bring everybody together?

42:42.417 --> 42:44.417
- Yes, I do.
You know, when I see Sutton

42:44.417 --> 42:47.209
and Erika fighting, I--it--
it's hard for me

42:47.209 --> 42:49.125
because I love Erika
and I've known her so long,

42:49.125 --> 42:51.125
and you and I became close
so fast.

42:51.125 --> 42:52.834
But having my sister here

42:52.834 --> 42:56.000
and having so much fun with her
and laughing.

42:56.000 --> 42:58.626
We've had such a great time,
and I--

42:58.626 --> 43:00.751
I'm really happy about that.

43:00.751 --> 43:04.417
- Well, it was a great season
all the way around.

43:04.417 --> 43:07.667
And in honor of the season,
Kathy's butlers,

43:07.667 --> 43:09.918
Patrick and Carlos...
[all screaming]

43:09.918 --> 43:11.834
Are here...
- Oh, my God.

43:11.834 --> 43:14.209
- With a special treat...
- Patrick!

43:14.209 --> 43:15.834
- For everybody.
- Patrick!

43:15.834 --> 43:18.083
- Thank you, fellas.
- Oh, my good--

43:18.083 --> 43:19.834
hello, hello!

43:19.834 --> 43:21.334
- Thank you, my love.

43:21.334 --> 43:22.834
- Oh, wait,
don't forget me, Carlos.

43:22.834 --> 43:24.459
Here you go, baby.

43:24.459 --> 43:25.876
- How are you?
Bonjour.

43:25.876 --> 43:27.250
- Oh.
- I said I would join.

43:27.250 --> 43:29.876
- Patrick, I'm glad
you weren't so traumatized

43:29.876 --> 43:32.250
by this group that you could
come back into the fervor.

43:32.250 --> 43:33.417
- Yes.

43:33.417 --> 43:36.292
- How can I be traumatized
with eight beautiful ladies?

43:36.292 --> 43:37.417
[laughter]
- Aww.

43:37.417 --> 43:39.584
- I apologize.
I'm sorry.

43:39.584 --> 43:41.000
- Amen.

43:41.000 --> 43:42.000
Amen.
- Thank you for everything.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.918
- Bottoms up, ladies.

43:43.918 --> 43:45.501
all: Bottoms up!

43:45.501 --> 43:46.792
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

43:46.792 --> 43:48.459
- Oh, my God!
- Is she doing it?

43:48.459 --> 43:49.792
- Who's gonna do it?
- I'll do it.

43:49.792 --> 43:50.792
- I'ma do it.
I'ma do it.

43:50.792 --> 43:52.167
- You did it!
Sutton did it!

43:52.167 --> 43:54.626
- Sutton did it?
- And so did you!

43:54.626 --> 43:56.584
- I couldn't do it.
- Delicious.

43:56.584 --> 43:58.792
- Sutton,
we are very much alike.

43:58.792 --> 44:01.375
[laughter]
- She did it too.

44:01.375 --> 44:05.375
- Wow.
- I'm the bartender.
