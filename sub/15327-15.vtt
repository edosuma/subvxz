WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:03.169
- Guess whose party
planning company

00:03.253 --> 00:05.046
is finally making
a profit?

00:05.130 --> 00:06.965
- This will be
a really lame story,

00:07.048 --> 00:09.759
if the answer's not you.

00:09.843 --> 00:10.927
- Profit, huh?

00:11.010 --> 00:12.345
Then you'll stop
slipping your flyers

00:12.429 --> 00:14.431
into the surgeons' lockers
at the hospital?

00:14.514 --> 00:16.349
- And you'll stop cold-calling
my friends parents

00:16.433 --> 00:18.893
asking them if
they're ready to party?

00:18.977 --> 00:21.354
- And I can take that
bumper sticker

00:21.438 --> 00:23.064
off my soccer pants?

00:23.148 --> 00:25.775
- Keep knockin' my hustle,
I won't give you these gifts.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.235
- Gifts?

00:27.318 --> 00:30.029
- We love you so much,
savvy business lady.

00:30.113 --> 00:33.491
- But, before the gifts,
I've got some more good news.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.326
- KIDS: [groaning]

00:35.410 --> 00:38.246
- Guess who got invited to the
membership luncheon for PWEG--

00:38.329 --> 00:41.624
the Philadelphia Women's
Entrepreneurs' Guild?

00:41.708 --> 00:44.127
- Gimme a minute.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.587
- That's great, honey.

00:45.670 --> 00:47.589
I'm so glad to see your hard
work's finally paying off.

00:47.672 --> 00:50.300
- Well, it's not a done deal.
This is basically my interview.

00:50.383 --> 00:52.927
It is the most prestigious
business club in Philadelphia,

00:53.011 --> 00:54.971
and these PWEG luncheons
are no joke.

00:55.054 --> 00:56.473
- I feel you, Steph.

00:56.556 --> 00:58.266
Molly and I are trying to
get in with these girls

00:58.349 --> 01:00.226
and we had to do
a lunch thing, too.

01:00.310 --> 01:03.313
Well, give them our lunch.
[laughing]

01:03.396 --> 01:04.980
- Just to hang out
with some girls?

01:05.063 --> 01:06.733
- Not some girls.

01:06.816 --> 01:08.818
Megan and Emily are the most
popular girls at school

01:08.902 --> 01:10.612
and once we're in
their social circle,

01:10.695 --> 01:12.405
we're set for life.
- Set for life?

01:12.489 --> 01:13.865
What does that even mean?

01:13.948 --> 01:18.119
- It means at lunch
we sit on the "good" steps.

01:18.203 --> 01:21.831
And next year, we decide who
sits on the "good" steps.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.792
You know, set for life.

01:23.875 --> 01:27.462
- Gabby, Gabby, Gabby, ugh!
Enough about Gabby.

01:27.545 --> 01:29.506
What are these?
- Shoes for Gabby.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.674
- Ugh.
- Oh, ho!

01:31.758 --> 01:34.803
The sneakers I wanted!
How'd you know?

01:34.886 --> 01:36.304
- I think it was

01:36.387 --> 01:38.306
the interpretive
dance you performed.

01:38.389 --> 01:41.017
And this is for
you, Aaron--

01:41.100 --> 01:45.146
and art kit with
122 individual supplies.

01:45.230 --> 01:49.067
- I'm obviously the favorite.

01:49.150 --> 01:52.153
- Not so fast.

01:52.237 --> 01:55.073
Oh, yeah, cologne!

01:55.156 --> 02:00.870
Finally, I can smell like
the man I know I am.

02:00.954 --> 02:03.122
- And this to go with that.

02:03.206 --> 02:05.959
- Oh, cool, a pen
that's also a... [clicking]

02:06.042 --> 02:08.002
...pen!

02:08.086 --> 02:09.711
- There's nothing wrong
with a good pen.

02:09.795 --> 02:11.005
It makes all
the young ladies say,

02:11.089 --> 02:12.465
"I would like to give

02:12.549 --> 02:14.467
that dapper young gentleman
my phone number."

02:14.551 --> 02:16.010
- Yes, exactly!

02:16.094 --> 02:17.637
Plus, I accidentally kept it

02:17.720 --> 02:18.888
when I signed the credit
card receipt.

02:18.972 --> 02:23.560
- Ooh, a stolen pen.
Dapper--with a dark side.

02:23.643 --> 02:27.897
- And this is for you, Charlie.
- Oh.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.566
- Thank you so much
for supporting me.

02:29.649 --> 02:32.735
- Oh, ho, thank you, honey,
for this...

02:32.819 --> 02:34.696
mortgage payment.

02:34.779 --> 02:37.824
- I know it's a little pricy,
but it's worth it.

02:37.907 --> 02:39.951
It's 100 percent
Vicuña wool.

02:40.034 --> 02:41.411
- Well, what is a Vicuña

02:41.494 --> 02:45.248
and was this sweater made from
the last one on Earth?

02:45.331 --> 02:48.042
- I bet that's hamster.

02:48.126 --> 02:51.045
Yep, it's hamster.

02:51.129 --> 02:54.215
- No, a Vicuña is like
a super fancy llama,

02:54.299 --> 02:57.343
the kind of llama that would
drive a Bentley.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.345
- You didn't get
yourself anything?

02:59.429 --> 03:01.389
- I got myself the best
anything--

03:01.472 --> 03:03.224
the new Enea tote bag.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.059
It comes out tomorrow
and I got one on hold.

03:05.143 --> 03:07.061
It's also a little pricy,
but worth it.

03:07.145 --> 03:08.521
- How pricy?

03:08.605 --> 03:10.523
- You know how your sweater's
driving that fancy car?

03:10.607 --> 03:14.444
My bag's sitting in the back
seat sippin' champagne.

03:14.527 --> 03:21.618
- ♪

03:21.701 --> 03:23.369
♪ Yeah Hey ♪

03:23.453 --> 03:28.458

03:36.007 --> 03:37.050
{\an8}- I, uh, need to
return this sweater.

03:37.133 --> 03:39.636
{\an8}- What's the matter?
Doesn't it fit?

03:39.719 --> 03:41.262
{\an8}- Oh, it fits just fine.

03:41.346 --> 03:43.014
{\an8}I tried it on this
morning, but--

03:43.097 --> 03:45.141
{\an8}- Ooh, that means you wore it
outside of the store.

03:45.224 --> 03:50.229
{\an8}Sorry, no returns on used items.

03:50.313 --> 03:51.814
{\an8}- Why not?

03:51.898 --> 03:53.524
{\an8}They're not underpants.

03:53.608 --> 03:55.526
{\an8}- Hey, what are you
guys doing here?

03:55.610 --> 03:57.278
{\an8}- Uh, what are you
doing here?

03:57.362 --> 03:58.821
{\an8}I thought you were
getting your bag.

03:58.905 --> 04:01.658
{\an8}- I am. This is where
I bought the bag.

04:01.741 --> 04:04.035
{\an8}Are you trying to return
that sweater?

04:04.118 --> 04:06.829
{\an8}- He was, but I
wouldn't let him.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.831
{\an8}- Thanks for the help.
Are there comment cards?

04:08.915 --> 04:12.251
{\an8}Because I did not have
the best experience today.

04:12.335 --> 04:14.003
{\an8}- Charlie, that sweater
was a gift.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.713
{\an8}You can't just
return a gift.

04:15.797 --> 04:16.923
{\an8}- Well, for what
this sweater cost,

04:17.005 --> 04:18.675
{\an8}I could buy
a boat load of sweaters.

04:18.757 --> 04:20.051
{\an8}And a boat!

04:20.134 --> 04:21.886
{\an8}- I earned the money.
I spent the money.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.680
{\an8}And you're gonna
wear that sweater.

04:23.763 --> 04:25.556
{\an8}- You don't even wear half
of the things I buy you.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.517
- Are you still going on about
that velvet pantsuit?

04:27.600 --> 04:28.977
- What? You're
a working professional.

04:29.060 --> 04:32.897
- I'm not "that" kind
of working professional.

04:32.981 --> 04:36.192
- Anyway, this sweater is too
nice for a man with three kids.

04:36.275 --> 04:38.736
Kids ruin nice things.
- No, they don't.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.363
- What happened to those
designer sunglasses

04:40.446 --> 04:41.948
Stephanie got me
for my birthday?

04:42.031 --> 04:43.241
- I stepped on 'em.

04:43.324 --> 04:45.034
- No, I stepped on 'em.

04:45.118 --> 04:48.037
- Oh, right, I stepped
on his watch.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.206
- What?

04:50.289 --> 04:52.208
You mean it's not 6:30?

04:52.291 --> 04:53.751
See?

04:53.835 --> 04:55.211
- What I see is you
keeping that sweater

04:55.294 --> 04:58.881
and me getting my new bag.
- [groaning]

04:58.965 --> 05:01.759
- Ooh, the Enea.
I have it right here.

05:01.843 --> 05:04.095
- [gasping]
Oh, she's so pretty!

05:04.178 --> 05:05.555
Come to mama.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.557
I have never loved anything
more than this bag.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.434
And, yes, I know
how that sounds.

05:09.517 --> 05:11.102
[sighing]

05:14.480 --> 05:15.314
Aaron, ten more minutes
of painting,

05:15.398 --> 05:17.567
and then we've gotta
leave for school.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.485
Remember, paint only
on the canvas

05:19.569 --> 05:21.404
and wipe your hands
when you're done.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.281
- Okay. What do you think?

05:23.364 --> 05:25.241
- Ah, is that a sandwich?

05:25.324 --> 05:27.452
- I call it "Lunch."

05:27.535 --> 05:29.328
- Hey, girls, you're
gonna be late for school.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.122
If Megan and Emily
aren't here soon,

05:31.205 --> 05:32.749
I'm driving you myself.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.876
- Steph, no, we wanna roll
up in a Junior's car,

05:34.959 --> 05:37.628
not senior's car.

05:37.712 --> 05:40.590
- Keep it up and you're gonna
roll up on a gurney.

05:40.673 --> 05:43.301
- Ooh, is that your new
Enea bag, Mrs. Phillips?

05:43.384 --> 05:44.969
- You know it.
- Oh!

05:45.053 --> 05:46.471
My mom really wanted one,

05:46.554 --> 05:49.265
but my dad got her
a treadmill, instead.

05:49.348 --> 05:53.978
We had to visit him at
my grandma's for a while.

05:54.062 --> 05:55.646
- Hey, Aaron,
grab your backpack.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.607
James, time to go!

05:57.690 --> 05:59.442
- Steph, why aren't
you using your Enea?

05:59.525 --> 06:01.444
- I want to keep it nice
for my luncheon tomorrow.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.196
Why aren't you wearing
your new sneakers?

06:03.279 --> 06:05.156
- Megan hasn't
approved them yet.

06:05.239 --> 06:07.366
I don't wanna rush her.
That's how Molly lost moccasins.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.452
- Morning, ladies.

06:09.535 --> 06:11.621
Molly!

06:11.704 --> 06:13.664
- Whoa, what did
you do, James--

06:13.748 --> 06:14.957
shower in that cologne?

06:15.041 --> 06:16.626
- It was more like
a sponge bath,

06:16.709 --> 06:19.170
but thank you
for noticing.

06:19.253 --> 06:21.839
- Hey, girl, you smellin'
my scent?

06:21.923 --> 06:25.635
- It's like in my mouth.

06:25.718 --> 06:27.845
- [doorbell ringing]
- Oh, Megan and Emily are here.

06:27.929 --> 06:30.223
Everyone, play it cool.

06:30.306 --> 06:31.307
- Gabby, people should
like you for who you are.

06:31.390 --> 06:34.977
Stop acting like these
girls are all that.

06:35.061 --> 06:36.354
- Hey!
- Hey!

06:36.437 --> 06:38.815
- Ooh, you two are cute!

06:38.898 --> 06:41.192
- You're like so pretty.

06:41.275 --> 06:44.904
- I want your face.
- Oh, stop.

06:44.987 --> 06:48.032
Gabby, I love them.

06:48.116 --> 06:50.785
- Hello, I'm Gabby's
handsome, younger,

06:50.868 --> 06:53.162
yet more mature
brother--James.

06:53.246 --> 06:54.455
But I'm already taken.

06:57.416 --> 07:00.002
- Boy, get in the car.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.547
And roll down
all the windows.

07:02.630 --> 07:04.340
- Do you think I'm
wearing too much cologne?

07:04.423 --> 07:08.052
- I like it--you smell like
three uncles combined.

07:08.136 --> 07:11.055
- Gabby, is that your Enea?

07:11.139 --> 07:12.515
- [laughing]
Oh, no, it's my step--

07:12.598 --> 07:15.643
- Yes, uh, she just
got it yesterday.

07:15.726 --> 07:16.894
- Can I borrow it?

07:16.978 --> 07:20.189
- I'd let you because
I'm cool like that,

07:20.273 --> 07:22.692
but I haven't even
used it myself yet.

07:22.775 --> 07:24.735
- Our rule is that you can't
wear anything cute

07:24.819 --> 07:26.154
until Megan wears it anyway.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.364
- I'll give it back
at the end of school.

07:28.447 --> 07:30.283
That's okay, right?

07:30.366 --> 07:34.036
Unless you wanna go
back to the "bad" steps.

07:34.120 --> 07:37.874
- No, I'm lovin'
the "good" steps.

07:37.957 --> 07:40.751
Oh.

07:40.835 --> 07:42.587
- This is perfect timing

07:42.670 --> 07:45.006
because I've just totally
trashed my bag.

07:51.137 --> 07:55.558
- [gasping]
Oh, it's just you.

07:55.641 --> 07:57.310
- What did you do
to Steph's new bag?

07:57.393 --> 08:00.396
- I let Megan borrow it
and her nail polish exploded--

08:00.479 --> 08:02.690
just like Stephanie's brain
will when she sees this.

08:02.773 --> 08:04.442
- Why don't you just
buy a new one?

08:04.525 --> 08:06.027
- Oh, sure, let me
just go get the money

08:06.110 --> 08:08.237
from my Swiss bank account.

08:08.321 --> 08:12.617
- I know you're mocking me,
but those can be very useful.

08:12.700 --> 08:14.952
You can just buy a fake bag.

08:15.036 --> 08:17.413
- Where am I gonna
get a fake bag

08:17.496 --> 08:18.581
before her luncheon tomorrow?

08:18.664 --> 08:20.416
- I can get
my hands on one--

08:20.499 --> 08:21.918
for the right price.

08:22.001 --> 08:26.088
- I can pay you 17 bucks
and a bobby pin.

08:26.172 --> 08:29.634
- I don't need the bobby pin.
I have a lock pick.

08:29.717 --> 08:31.761
What I do need
is you to talk me up

08:31.844 --> 08:34.013
so your hot new friends
are into me--

08:34.096 --> 08:35.306
and Molly gets all jealous--

08:35.389 --> 08:38.976
and, therefore, into me.

08:39.059 --> 08:42.438
- Fine. But how do you know
where to get a fake bag?

08:42.520 --> 08:44.440
- Remember Ryan's uncle
who went to jail?

08:44.524 --> 08:47.443
- Yeah?
- He's out.

08:52.198 --> 08:53.991
- Hey, Dad.
- Oh, get away from me!

08:54.075 --> 08:56.327
- I haven't moved.

08:56.410 --> 08:58.996
- Just keep your paint
covered hands over there--

08:59.080 --> 09:01.832
away from my new sweater.
- Chill out, man.

09:01.916 --> 09:03.459
I was just gonna ask
you to go to the kitchen

09:03.543 --> 09:04.627
and get me a popsicle.

09:04.710 --> 09:09.006
- I can't be getting
melty things in this sweater.

09:09.090 --> 09:11.509
I can't do anything
in this sweater.

09:11.592 --> 09:13.511
- Take it off.
- I wish I could.

09:13.594 --> 09:14.971
I promised Stephanie
I would wear it,

09:15.054 --> 09:16.472
so, I'm gonna wear it.

09:16.555 --> 09:18.015
And I'm going to enjoy it.

09:18.099 --> 09:21.143
- Don't people usually smile
when they enjoy something?

09:21.227 --> 09:23.020
- Single people.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.855
- Charlie, I'm gonna be
late for my luncheon.

09:24.939 --> 09:26.148
Have you seen my new bag?

09:26.232 --> 09:28.067
- No. Can you take
a different one?

09:28.150 --> 09:29.902
- With that bag,
I am a stylish professional

09:29.986 --> 09:32.238
they are going to want
in their club.

09:32.321 --> 09:33.990
Without it, I am just
some wanna-be

09:34.073 --> 09:36.409
who lied about
having a bag.

09:36.492 --> 09:39.203
Oh, there's my Enea!

09:39.287 --> 09:41.664
- Oh, were you
looking for this?

09:41.747 --> 09:45.751
- It's been sitting right
here the whole time.

09:45.835 --> 09:46.711
- Come here, baby.

09:46.794 --> 09:49.547
Don't you ever run
away from mama again.

09:49.630 --> 09:51.841
[cooing]

09:51.924 --> 09:53.884
- Oh, I didn't think
that would fool her.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.720
That knock-off's amazing.

09:55.803 --> 09:58.014
- You know what'll
be amazing?

09:58.097 --> 10:00.683
When Molly slaps those girls
because they're all over me.

10:00.766 --> 10:02.018
Make that happen.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.478
- Sure, you earned it.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.105
Oh, hey, do you
think Ryan's uncle

10:06.188 --> 10:07.690
could get me some
fake designer stuff?

10:07.773 --> 10:09.275
- He's gettin' out of
the knock-off business,

10:09.358 --> 10:13.029
but he could get you
a deal on a baby panda.

10:16.615 --> 10:19.410
- Hi, I'm Stephanie Phillips.
I'm meeting some women here.

10:19.493 --> 10:20.411
- Oh, yes, your party
is waiting for you.

10:20.494 --> 10:25.916
- Wait, before I go,
how do I look?

10:26.000 --> 10:29.962
- You've got a little
something on your dress.

10:30.046 --> 10:31.380
- Oh, no.

10:31.464 --> 10:34.216
The color's coming
off my bag.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.217
I can't go over
there like this.

10:35.301 --> 10:38.346
- Stephanie, over here.

10:38.429 --> 10:41.057
- I have to go over
there like this.

10:43.184 --> 10:45.394
Hm!

10:46.645 --> 10:48.898
It's a pleasure.
- Oh, put that hand away.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.149
We're huggers.
- Uh!

10:50.232 --> 10:52.276
Not me. I'm an air kisser.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.069
[kissing]

10:53.152 --> 10:57.573
[blowing kisses]

10:57.656 --> 10:59.950
- So, Stephanie, we've done
our research on you

11:00.034 --> 11:01.369
and we're very impressed.

11:01.452 --> 11:04.622
- Your company's been handling
some high-profile events.

11:04.705 --> 11:09.418
- It has. You know, I'd love to
show you some recent pictures.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.295
Huh?

11:11.379 --> 11:13.673
- Is your bag rubbing
off on your dress?

11:13.756 --> 11:15.925
- Ew, is that a knock-off?

11:16.008 --> 11:20.638
- Of course not.
Obviously, I'm bleeding.

11:20.721 --> 11:22.681
I donated a kidney
on the way over here.

11:22.765 --> 11:25.559
No good deed.
Am I right, ladies?

11:30.648 --> 11:32.858
- Hey, son, what are you
painting--a squirrel?

11:32.942 --> 11:35.152
- Yep. Hold on.

11:35.236 --> 11:38.697
Perfect! Stay like that.

11:38.781 --> 11:42.368
- Okay, I've got all
the clothes I'm cool trading.

11:42.451 --> 11:45.371
- When do Emily and Megan get
here for your clothing drive?

11:45.454 --> 11:47.289
- In an hour and it's
a clothing swap.

11:47.373 --> 11:48.791
- You're giving
clothes I bought you

11:48.874 --> 11:49.708
to people I don't know--
I'll call it what I want.

11:49.792 --> 11:53.546
- Whatever you call it--
don't be here.

11:53.629 --> 12:00.219
- Did that squirrel have
six whiskers or five?

12:00.302 --> 12:02.304
You know, Dad, this
would be a lot easier

12:02.388 --> 12:06.308
without that "no squirrels
in the house" rule.

12:06.392 --> 12:09.979
- Believe me, I was surprised
that we had to have that rule.

12:10.062 --> 12:12.523
- I can't paint under
these conditions.

12:12.606 --> 12:14.984
No squirrels.
Wipe your hands.

12:15.067 --> 12:18.070
Get outta here!
I'm takin' a shower!

12:18.154 --> 12:21.949
- Stupid luncheon!
Stupid bag!

12:22.032 --> 12:23.284
Stupid store
keeping me on hold!

12:23.367 --> 12:26.745
And that Barry Manilow
is not calming me down!

12:26.829 --> 12:28.956
- How did it go?
Did you get in?

12:29.039 --> 12:29.790
- How could I get in, Charlie?

12:29.874 --> 12:32.918
My super expensive
bag is a fake.

12:33.002 --> 12:36.755
This made-in-Italy bag
has a made-in-Detroit label.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.424
Do you know what that means?

12:38.507 --> 12:40.634
- Jobs are comin' back
to America?

12:40.718 --> 12:43.262
- It means I'll never get
into that business club.

12:43.345 --> 12:44.430
And I have to.

12:44.513 --> 12:46.390
If they let me in,
I'm set for life.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.851
- You get to sit
on the "good" steps, too.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.895
- No, this is nothing
like Gabby.

12:50.978 --> 12:51.854
Gabby is social climbing.

12:51.937 --> 12:55.941
I'm moving up to
a higher class of people.

12:56.025 --> 12:57.902
- You sure told me.

12:57.985 --> 13:00.196
- Well, now, I'm gonna tell
that phony boutique

13:00.279 --> 13:01.363
they'd better give
me a full refund,

13:01.447 --> 13:03.157
or I'm gonna smack 'em
upside the head

13:03.240 --> 13:06.076
with this cheap bag!

13:06.160 --> 13:09.955
I don't care.
I'll whoop 'em with these!

13:13.584 --> 13:15.920
- Who wants this
super cute dress?

13:16.003 --> 13:17.004
- I'll take it.
- Oh, can I borrow it?

13:17.087 --> 13:19.798
- No.

13:19.882 --> 13:22.968
And, in exchange,
I'll swap you this.

13:23.052 --> 13:24.720
- A polyester turtleneck?

13:24.803 --> 13:29.975
- It's my Mom's.
It gave her a horrible rash.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.977
- But you're gonna look
adorable in that.

13:32.061 --> 13:33.812
- Yeah, just wear
an undershirt.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.147
- Um, okay, I'll take
it, I guess.

13:35.231 --> 13:37.608
- My turn.

13:37.691 --> 13:39.652
What does someone wanna give me
for these leather pants?

13:39.735 --> 13:41.237
- Oh, hey, those are mine.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.947
I let you borrow them
like a year ago.

13:43.030 --> 13:43.656
- I want them.

13:43.739 --> 13:44.740
- Uh, I'm not swapping them.

13:44.823 --> 13:51.288
- But I want them--
so you kind of have to.

13:51.372 --> 13:54.208
And, in exchange,
I'll swap you this.

13:54.291 --> 13:58.963
- Uh, this is a pillow case.

13:59.046 --> 13:59.588
You guys just brought
a bunch of junk

13:59.672 --> 14:00.548
to swap for our clothes.

14:00.631 --> 14:03.300
- Oh, my gosh, we would never.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.844
Oh, look, I even brought
my favorite belt.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.847
- That's a shoelace.

14:08.931 --> 14:09.848
- Unh-unh, it's a belt.

14:09.932 --> 14:12.685
- You can't just call
something something.

14:12.768 --> 14:15.020
- Yes, you can.
I'll wear it.

14:15.104 --> 14:18.399
It'll go with almost
all of my shoes.

14:18.482 --> 14:20.401
So can we hang with
you guys now?

14:20.484 --> 14:21.694
- What do you think
we're doing?

14:21.777 --> 14:23.821
- She means hang when we're not
doing your homework,

14:23.904 --> 14:24.989
or buying your lunch,

14:25.072 --> 14:27.700
or coming over before school
to brush your hair.

14:27.783 --> 14:30.995
- Although your hair is so soft,
it's actually a pleasure.

14:33.789 --> 14:36.542
- What's that smell?

14:39.336 --> 14:41.880
- Hello, ladies.

14:41.964 --> 14:43.591
Megan, Emily,

14:43.674 --> 14:45.050
you both look lovely.

14:45.134 --> 14:48.012
Gabby, you look
indebted to me.

14:48.095 --> 14:51.015
- There is my handsome,
desirable brother James

14:51.098 --> 14:53.726
who is a great
conversationalist.

14:53.809 --> 14:58.188
- Whose bedtime was recently
upped to 10:30.

14:58.272 --> 14:59.607
And since we can now chat

14:59.690 --> 15:01.775
until the wee hours
of the night,

15:01.859 --> 15:05.154
let me get y'all digits.

15:05.237 --> 15:08.407
Anybody have
a fancy pen?

15:08.490 --> 15:12.661
Why, James, you dapper
gentleman, you.

15:12.745 --> 15:15.956
- I'm uncomfortable.

15:16.040 --> 15:19.251
- Please stop bothering
our new best friends.

15:19.335 --> 15:22.796
- Molly! Have you been
here the whole time?

15:22.880 --> 15:26.717
- Oh, James, brother who
is every woman's dream,

15:26.800 --> 15:29.011
why don't you run
off to the kitchen

15:29.094 --> 15:30.846
and have Stephanie
make you something

15:30.929 --> 15:32.181
that takes a long
time to eat?

15:32.264 --> 15:33.599
- Can't. She's not here.

15:33.682 --> 15:37.728
Dad said she went to the mall
to return her new bag.

15:37.811 --> 15:39.688
I'll be one sec, girls.

15:39.772 --> 15:42.274
Keep stealing my stuff.

15:42.358 --> 15:46.445
You mean Stephanie's taking the
fake bag back to the real store?

15:46.528 --> 15:50.741
- Uh-huh. Oh, wait,
yeah, you are in trouble.

15:50.824 --> 15:54.036
- You think?

15:54.119 --> 15:56.622
Oh, please pick up.
Please, pick up.

15:56.705 --> 16:00.042
- [cell phone ringing]

16:00.125 --> 16:03.796
- I'm pretty sure
she's not gonna pick up.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.968
- Hey, you sold me
a knock-off!

16:10.052 --> 16:14.264
- We don't sell
fake handbags here!

16:14.348 --> 16:16.433
- Don't buy that.
It's a fake.

16:16.517 --> 16:17.810
- WOMAN: What?
- Ma'am, please.

16:17.893 --> 16:23.899
- Look, the dye rubs off!

16:23.982 --> 16:25.651
That's because it's blue.

16:25.734 --> 16:29.530
But the clasp just
pops right off.

16:29.613 --> 16:31.240
[straining]

16:31.323 --> 16:35.869
Wow, that's, uh,
really on there.

16:35.953 --> 16:40.624
Well, the straps are hanging
on by a thread!

16:44.420 --> 16:46.046
- It seems pretty
sturdy to me.

16:46.130 --> 16:47.297
- It's not. It's junk.

16:47.381 --> 16:49.842
See? Made in--

16:49.925 --> 16:51.719
Italy?

16:51.802 --> 16:55.097
Where's the made-in-
Detroit tag, huh, sneaky?

16:55.180 --> 16:57.516
- There isn't one
because it wasn't.

16:57.599 --> 16:59.268
- I bet they got
the lining from Italy,

16:59.351 --> 17:01.395
but the outside part
from Detroit.

17:01.478 --> 17:02.813
- That makes no sense.

17:02.896 --> 17:04.064
- It will when you see it.

17:07.608 --> 17:09.236
- What are you doing, lady?
Please stop!

17:09.319 --> 17:10.904
- No, you're selling
fakes and I can prove it!

17:10.988 --> 17:15.284
- Steph! Steph!
They don't sell fakes.

17:15.367 --> 17:18.203
I replaced your bag
with a fake one because...

17:18.287 --> 17:20.455
I let Megan borrow it
and she messed it up.

17:20.539 --> 17:24.001
- What's that now?

17:24.084 --> 17:28.422
- That bag is real.

17:28.505 --> 17:30.299
- I see.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.551
Yeah, I'm gonna go ahead
and pay for this one.

17:32.634 --> 17:34.762
Can you split that between
five credit cards?

17:38.432 --> 17:40.434
- FYI, should this ever
happen to you,

17:40.517 --> 17:42.811
Tub 'n Tile cleanser doesn't
get nail polish out.

17:47.441 --> 17:50.903
Look, I'm really sorry
about everything.

17:50.986 --> 17:52.237
I screwed up.

17:52.321 --> 17:55.532
Those popular girls got
me all turned around.

17:55.616 --> 17:59.286
- Yeah, those luncheon ladies
got me all turned around, too.

17:59.369 --> 18:01.121
- You were right
when you said

18:01.205 --> 18:03.207
people should should like
us for who we are.

18:03.290 --> 18:05.125
We're awesome.
- Yeah, we are.

18:05.209 --> 18:07.503
We don't need them--
we've got each other.

18:07.586 --> 18:10.214
- That's right, we are strong,
independent women

18:10.297 --> 18:13.050
and we get our validation
from ourselves.

18:13.133 --> 18:14.510
And sometimes
our boyfriends.

18:14.593 --> 18:16.220
- And sometimes
our husbands.

18:16.303 --> 18:19.765
- I was kidding.
- Yeah, me, too.

18:19.848 --> 18:25.103
- [cell phone ringing]
- Oh, there's my phone.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.356
Huh, it's Trudy
from the luncheon.

18:27.439 --> 18:29.733
I can't believe
they're even bothering.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.109
Hello?

18:31.193 --> 18:32.569
Uh-huh.

18:32.653 --> 18:34.238
Mm-hm.

18:34.321 --> 18:35.531
Are you kidding?

18:35.614 --> 18:37.616
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

18:37.699 --> 18:38.534
See you the first
Tuesday of every month.

18:38.617 --> 18:41.411
[gasping]
I got in!

18:41.495 --> 18:43.413
- I can't believe
you accepted.

18:43.497 --> 18:44.748
What about all that
"we don't need them"?

18:44.832 --> 18:48.377
- That was before
I had them.

18:48.460 --> 18:49.837
Now I'm in!

18:49.920 --> 18:51.797
And all it took was for me
to send a Town car

18:51.880 --> 18:53.465
and get them
facials at the spa.

18:53.549 --> 18:54.466
- So what's the lesson here?

18:54.550 --> 18:57.594
That I can't have fancy,
superficial friends

18:57.678 --> 18:59.847
until I can afford to
buy them, myself?

18:59.930 --> 19:01.348
- No. No.

19:01.431 --> 19:03.725
Kinda.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.979
- That is a terrible lesson.

19:07.062 --> 19:09.648
- But a valuable one?

19:09.731 --> 19:13.068
Oh, shut up!
You ruined my bag.

19:13.151 --> 19:15.237
- Look who got Emily's digits.

19:15.320 --> 19:15.904
Well, she gave me
five out of seven,

19:15.988 --> 19:16.905
but that's more than enough

19:16.989 --> 19:20.617
to make Molly jealous
when I show her.

19:20.701 --> 19:22.744
- Isn't she gonna notice that
it's not a whole phone number?

19:22.828 --> 19:23.912
- Ah, she won't care.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.373
She'll be too busy wondering
how this dapper gentleman

19:26.456 --> 19:28.959
got into her closet.

19:29.042 --> 19:31.587
- James! James!

19:36.216 --> 19:38.010
- Charlie, you were right.

19:38.093 --> 19:40.262
When you have kids, you can't
have anything nice.

19:40.345 --> 19:43.056
- Funny--I was just gonna
say you were right.

19:43.140 --> 19:46.018
Despite a few close calls
with mega-mess here,

19:46.101 --> 19:48.729
my sweater is still perfect.

19:48.812 --> 19:51.481
Oh, wait, what's that?

19:51.565 --> 19:53.942
Oh! No! No! No!

19:54.026 --> 19:56.486
Stay perfect.
Oh...

19:56.570 --> 19:59.364
- The last time I get anything
nice for any of us.

19:59.448 --> 20:00.616
- Hey, I love the stuff
you got me.

20:00.699 --> 20:03.201
Even the pen.

20:03.285 --> 20:08.415
Wait, I just had that.
Where did it go?

20:08.498 --> 20:10.542
Found it.

20:13.629 --> 20:14.963
- James!

20:15.047 --> 20:18.800
- All right, this is more
like what I expected.

20:18.884 --> 20:20.385
But, you know what?

20:20.469 --> 20:22.262
Kids are the reason
cushions have two sides.

20:26.600 --> 20:29.645
- You told me to
wipe my hands.

20:31.063 --> 20:46.995
- ♪
