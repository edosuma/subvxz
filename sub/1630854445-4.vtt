WEBVTT

00:39.164 --> 00:42.125
Oh! Fuck.

00:43.084 --> 00:45.462
Shit.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.273
No, no.

01:05.356 --> 01:07.567
No, not again. No.

01:42.852 --> 01:45.688
<i> The environment's…</i>
-Hey, Char, what is this?

01:45.772 --> 01:48.274
What are you watching?
-<i>I'm different. I wanna go home.</i>

01:48.358 --> 01:51.402
<i>That's my only objective. Get home.</i>

01:51.486 --> 01:54.072
<i>-It'll be five years and nine months.</i>

01:54.155 --> 01:55.573
<i>I'm more than ready to go home.</i>

01:55.657 --> 01:58.034
<i>You don't appreciate</i>
<i>what you have until you don't have it.</i>

01:58.118 --> 02:00.787
You shouldn't have gotten caught, Connie.

02:02.455 --> 02:03.998
I was watching that.

02:04.082 --> 02:06.626
No, you weren't.
Nobody should be watching that.

02:07.377 --> 02:08.753
Okay.

02:09.254 --> 02:10.839
All right.

02:11.673 --> 02:13.424
What-- what are you doing?

02:13.508 --> 02:15.718
My zipper is stuck,
so I need some help, please.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.555
Well, uh, you… you can--

02:18.638 --> 02:22.892
OMG, don't make this awkward, Charlie.
Just zip up the dress.

02:22.976 --> 02:24.394
-Okay.

02:30.900 --> 02:33.069
Are you sure you don't want me
to come to the funeral?

02:33.153 --> 02:35.488
Uh, I don't wanna go,
so why would I make you go?

02:35.572 --> 02:37.198
I'm just going to say goodbye.

02:37.907 --> 02:38.908
To Steve?

02:39.576 --> 02:41.202
No, to Ben.

02:41.786 --> 02:43.496
I mean, he doesn't live here.

02:43.580 --> 02:47.709
So, after today,
I won't-- I won't need to see him anymore.

02:48.751 --> 02:50.628
-Which is good, honestly.

02:50.712 --> 02:54.799
Because… that family is just…

02:54.883 --> 02:58.428
They are… a riptide.

02:59.762 --> 03:01.639
It's just really hard to be--

03:01.723 --> 03:03.141
It's just-- oh, fu--

03:05.560 --> 03:07.353
Good talking with you, kid.

03:07.979 --> 03:09.939
So glad I'm raising an empath.

03:10.857 --> 03:11.858
What?

03:14.402 --> 03:17.447
Unfortunately,
the biopsy confirmed

03:17.530 --> 03:19.449
that it is cervical cancer,

03:19.532 --> 03:21.451
and it has spread to your liver.

03:21.534 --> 03:24.287
And when we see these masses
so far from where they started,

03:24.370 --> 03:27.165
it means we're looking at
a stage four diagnosis.

03:28.791 --> 03:30.752
I know this is hard to hear,

03:30.835 --> 03:32.420
but there is a path forward.

03:33.004 --> 03:36.382
Surgery isn't an option,
but we will start with chemotherapy,

03:36.466 --> 03:39.093
and if that is successful,
you'll move on to radiation.

03:41.137 --> 03:42.639
One step at a time.

03:43.973 --> 03:45.558
Judy?

03:45.642 --> 03:47.852
-Judy?
-Is that your boat?

03:49.812 --> 03:51.314
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.775
It's beautiful. I always wanted a boat.

03:54.359 --> 03:56.277
-That's a catamaran, right?
-Yeah.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.697
-I know this is a lot to process.
-Hmm.

03:59.781 --> 04:02.200
So, if you have
any questions, I'm…

04:05.995 --> 04:08.039
What if I had never gotten those scans?

04:08.122 --> 04:09.457
What do you mean?

04:09.540 --> 04:12.877
I just mean that
if I had never gotten in that accident,

04:12.961 --> 04:15.922
I wouldn't even know that I have… it.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.924
Well, then it's a good thing you did.

04:18.508 --> 04:19.926
Because now you <i>do </i>know,

04:20.009 --> 04:22.262
and we can get started treating it
as quickly as possible.

04:22.345 --> 04:24.472
Right, but I just-- I feel fine.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.684
I mean, I feel a little sore
from the accident, but…

04:28.309 --> 04:29.978
I definitely don't feel anything

04:30.061 --> 04:33.273
like what you're say-- saying that it is.

04:33.356 --> 04:35.525
I get that this is hard to accept.

04:35.608 --> 04:39.112
No, it… it's not that.
Really, I… Thank you.

04:39.195 --> 04:43.116
But I just-- I th--
I think I need another scan.

04:43.199 --> 04:45.576
I just-- I feel like
maybe the biopsy was faulty

04:45.660 --> 04:47.912
or maybe, like,
the needle lady did something wrong.

04:47.996 --> 04:48.955
Because, honestly,

04:49.038 --> 04:52.166
this whole thing just,
like, came out of nowhere.

04:53.126 --> 04:57.213
So I think maybe it's…
just like a mistake, right?

04:57.297 --> 04:58.548
Death comes for us all.

04:59.549 --> 05:01.801
But our ability to live fully

05:01.884 --> 05:04.095
lies in our willingness to accept

05:04.637 --> 05:06.514
that death is a part of life.

05:07.181 --> 05:11.060
When the unspeakable happens,
when someone is taken too young

05:11.144 --> 05:14.897
or by unthinkable violence,
as Jesus himself was,

05:14.981 --> 05:16.441
it shakes our very foundation.

05:18.526 --> 05:20.737
In these darkest of times,

05:21.738 --> 05:25.283
we must look to God's light
and to one another

05:25.825 --> 05:30.455
for comfort and community
so we may begin to heal together.

05:31.205 --> 05:32.290
Amen.

05:32.373 --> 05:34.959
Let's go say goodbye to Ben
and then get the fuck out of here.

05:36.794 --> 05:38.546
-Oh, do I have to take you to work?
-What?

05:38.629 --> 05:40.048
What did the mechanic say?

05:40.131 --> 05:41.716
-What?
-About your car?

05:41.799 --> 05:45.511
Oh. Oh, yeah, right.
He said it's fine. It's totally fine.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.890
-Are you okay?
-No, this is really intense.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.184
Yeah, this is a fuck ton of awful.

05:52.101 --> 05:53.644
All right, why don't I just slip out,

05:53.728 --> 05:56.356
and we can send them some flowers
and a nice note?

05:56.439 --> 05:58.066
Don't you think
that's a little impersonal?

05:58.149 --> 05:59.484
Look, that's kind of the point.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.736
I mean, I'm the last person
who should be personal--

06:01.819 --> 06:03.905
-Hey.
-Hey.

06:03.988 --> 06:06.199
Thank you both so much for coming.
It really--

06:06.282 --> 06:07.867
-Yeah. Oh, gosh.
-It really means a lot.

06:07.950 --> 06:09.952
-We wouldn't have missed this.
-Of course, no, yeah.

06:10.036 --> 06:13.956
-We had to be here. This is what we do.
-We wanna say goodbyes and stuff.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.417
I'm so sorry. I love you.

06:16.501 --> 06:19.587
Thank you, Jude.

06:19.670 --> 06:21.881
-All right, me…
-Aww.

06:25.385 --> 06:28.304
Oh, I'm sure my mother
would love to see you.

06:28.388 --> 06:29.597
Oh, she would?

06:36.145 --> 06:37.563
Might wanna give it a beat.

06:37.647 --> 06:39.023
-Yeah.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.488
We're gonna say goodbye to Eileen,
and then we are out of here.

06:45.571 --> 06:46.948
I don't know if you've noticed,

06:47.031 --> 06:49.200
but Eileen is standing
right next to the casket.

06:49.283 --> 06:52.078
Yeah, I noticed that.
It's not sitting well.

06:53.162 --> 06:55.623
-Who's the guy in the wheelchair?
-That's the dad. Jim.

06:55.706 --> 06:58.251
What? The dad's in a wheelchair?

06:58.334 --> 07:00.211
-What happened?
-They never talk about it.

07:00.294 --> 07:02.672
I've never seen him without that blanket,
so it can't be good.

07:02.755 --> 07:05.550
Oh, gosh. Yeah, well,
it can't be as bad as an open casket.

07:05.633 --> 07:08.636
Why would you do that?
It's like, no one wants to be remembered

07:08.719 --> 07:11.013
looking like yourself,
but make it marzipan.

07:12.682 --> 07:16.060
You know what? If I die before you,
keep my shit locked down.

07:16.144 --> 07:18.646
You're not dying. No one is dying.

07:18.729 --> 07:21.607
-Hey, girl.
-Hey, girl.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.401
So tragic, right, girl?

07:23.484 --> 07:24.360
Right, girl.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.655
He never got to see the Northern Lights
or open that hotel.

07:27.738 --> 07:29.657
Or go on safari to Africa and…

07:31.325 --> 07:32.869
-And kill an elephant.
-Ah!

07:32.952 --> 07:35.455
That is so awful.

07:35.538 --> 07:37.790
-He just had so much life left to live.
-Mm-hmm.

07:37.874 --> 07:41.127
Makes you really wanna
carpe diem the day, right, girl?

07:41.210 --> 07:43.421
-Right, girl.
-Right this way, girls.

07:43.504 --> 07:44.881
Okay.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.341
-I know.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.595
-I know.

07:50.678 --> 07:51.762
Oh, God.

07:51.846 --> 07:53.723
-Okay, we don't have to look.
-I can't.

07:53.806 --> 07:55.224
-I'm looking.
-Me too.

07:57.059 --> 07:58.936
-I'm so confused.
-What is happening?

07:59.020 --> 08:00.813
-Isn't it horrible?

08:00.897 --> 08:02.398
The body was NSFF.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.816
What the-- what does that mean?

08:03.900 --> 08:05.568
-Not suitable for a funeral.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.778
You can't pour soup into a suit.

08:08.779 --> 08:11.699
Apparently, the FBI
is still scrubbing the body,

08:11.782 --> 08:14.410
well, the husk of it, for evidence.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.786
-God, really?
-Mm-hmm.

08:15.870 --> 08:18.623
-Judy, I see you came.

08:18.706 --> 08:20.166
Of course, Eileen.

08:20.249 --> 08:22.418
Oh, I'm so sorry.

08:25.087 --> 08:28.049
-It doesn't feel real.
-None of it does.

08:31.802 --> 08:33.763
-I always loved this suit on him.
-Hmm.

08:33.846 --> 08:35.473
He looked so good in blue.

08:36.307 --> 08:38.142
Oh, he does, doesn't he?

08:48.319 --> 08:49.403
Poor thing.

08:49.487 --> 08:52.198
Such a devastating time for her.
And for me.

08:52.281 --> 08:53.533
Mm. Here we go.

08:53.616 --> 08:56.410
-She decided not to sell the mansion.
-Oh.

08:56.494 --> 08:58.162
Said she couldn't let go
of one more thing,

08:58.246 --> 09:00.831
which of course I understand.

09:00.915 --> 09:03.751
-I wrote the book on loss.
-Actually a lot of books on loss.

09:03.834 --> 09:06.504
-But it would've been so much money.
-Mm-hmm.

09:06.587 --> 09:08.839
I could truly have had systemic wealth.

09:08.923 --> 09:11.968
God, I'm so sorry for your financial loss.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.678
Thank you.

09:14.804 --> 09:16.973
-I have to get out of here.
-I'm right behind you.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.016
Oh, Jen, so kind of you to come.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.269
-Save yourself.
-Thank you.

09:21.894 --> 09:23.187
-Eileen.

09:23.271 --> 09:27.608
My condolences,
really, just all of the condolences.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.026
Thank you, dear.

09:29.110 --> 09:31.696
We're going to be heading back
to the house with a small group.

09:31.779 --> 09:33.906
I-- I was hoping you'd care to join.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.534
Oh, no, I really can't.

09:36.617 --> 09:38.536
-I have--
-I know it'd mean a lot to Benji.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.496
He's having such a hard time.

09:42.039 --> 09:44.709
He could
really use a good friend.

09:44.792 --> 09:46.919
Oh, Eileen, come here.

09:49.213 --> 09:50.339
Okay.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.635
-Let it out.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.596
Oh, shit.

10:38.679 --> 10:39.680
<i>Ay, Dios mío.</i>

10:39.764 --> 10:42.308
-Give me a break.
-You just got back from the hospital.

10:42.391 --> 10:44.977
You're supposed to be on bed rest.
You cannot leave.

10:45.061 --> 10:48.064
Those doctors don't know
what they're talking about.

10:48.147 --> 10:51.651
I can't get fresh air?
This place smells like death.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.653
Why don't you watch some TV or something?

10:53.736 --> 10:55.571
I mean, we can find you a telenovela.

10:55.655 --> 10:57.740
-That's racist.
-Really?

10:57.823 --> 11:00.868
Hey! Teri, I can tap you out if you want.

11:00.951 --> 11:01.827
Are you sure?

11:01.911 --> 11:02.912
Happy to.

11:02.995 --> 11:04.288
Thank you.

11:05.331 --> 11:08.084
By the way, great top.
I love that neckline on you.

11:08.167 --> 11:09.960
Are you serious? I got this on sale.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.295
-What?
-Mm-hmm.

11:11.379 --> 11:12.880
-Look at you, smart shopper!
-Thank you.

11:12.963 --> 11:14.507
Yeah! Thank <i>you</i>!

11:21.639 --> 11:23.724
-What the hell are you doing?
-Getting you out of here.

11:23.808 --> 11:26.769
-This place does smell like death.
-It does, right?

11:30.356 --> 11:32.149
-Heard it was a crime of passion.
-Yeah.

11:32.233 --> 11:33.943
They're saying he was stabbed in the head.

11:34.026 --> 11:35.903
Can you imagine a more painful way to go?

11:35.986 --> 11:38.197
Get me the fuck out of here.

11:38.280 --> 11:39.115
Hey.

11:40.157 --> 11:43.661
Hey! Did my mother guilt you
into coming to the after-party?

11:43.744 --> 11:46.747
Oh, God, no. No, no.
No, I mean, that's not the--

11:46.831 --> 11:48.124
No, there's no guilt.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.209
-No, I'm-- I'm happy to be here.
-Yeah, not guilt…

11:50.292 --> 11:53.212
-I'm not happy to be here.
-Yeah, no. Well-- yeah.

11:53.295 --> 11:55.381
-Of course you're not happy.
-Because it's, uh--

11:55.464 --> 11:56.424
Yeah, who's happy?

11:56.507 --> 11:57.675
Not me!

11:57.758 --> 12:00.177
-Yeah. Anyhoo, I, um…

12:00.803 --> 12:03.639
I'm assuming you're gonna be
going back to San Fran now that-- that--

12:03.723 --> 12:05.683
No, actually, um,

12:05.766 --> 12:08.144
they asked me to stick around
while the FBI,

12:08.227 --> 12:10.312
uh, do their thang.

12:10.396 --> 12:12.148
-Oh, yeah, sure.
-So…

12:12.773 --> 12:14.775
-That thang.
-Who's this?

12:15.317 --> 12:18.779
Oh, sorry. Uh, this is my father Jim.
Dad, this is my…

12:19.864 --> 12:21.157
My friend Jen.

12:22.158 --> 12:23.242
Happy to meet you.

12:23.325 --> 12:25.202
I'm so sorry for your loss, Jim.

12:25.286 --> 12:26.287
Me too.

12:27.663 --> 12:30.374
Your children
aren't supposed to go before you.

12:31.459 --> 12:33.544
It's… not right.

12:35.880 --> 12:36.756
No, it's not.

12:36.839 --> 12:38.841
Ben, would you take my plate for me?

12:38.924 --> 12:40.134
Sure, Dad.

12:43.304 --> 12:44.680
He's a good boy.

12:45.389 --> 12:46.474
Yeah, he is.

12:47.558 --> 12:50.436
I'm so happy he finally met a nice girl.

12:50.519 --> 12:53.063
Oh, no, no. I'm not, um--

12:54.023 --> 12:55.274
No, we're just friends.

12:56.317 --> 12:58.235
Friends are good too.

12:58.944 --> 13:01.572
Oh, no. That is my butt.
That is my butthole.

13:02.323 --> 13:03.866
Would you excuse me? I just--

13:03.949 --> 13:07.828
I just need to, um,
get the fuck away from you.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.252
Where the fuck is the bathroom?

13:30.267 --> 13:31.769
What the fuck?

13:35.022 --> 13:36.148
What-- oh!

13:36.232 --> 13:38.818
No, no. Oh, no, no, no, no.

13:38.901 --> 13:40.986
No, no, no, no, no.
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?

13:44.740 --> 13:47.618
Okay…

13:48.702 --> 13:50.621
Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben, Ben.

13:52.373 --> 13:54.083
Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

13:59.129 --> 14:01.090
<i>-You've reached Ben. Leave a message.</i>
-Oh, fuck.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.010
Okay.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.137
I'm in hell.

14:12.518 --> 14:13.894
None of you move, please.

14:13.978 --> 14:17.231
Oh, come on now.
You don't know Celia Cruz?

14:17.314 --> 14:20.109
-The Queen of Salsa?
-I gotta get into that. I love salsa.

14:20.192 --> 14:22.111
Jesus, Mom.
We've been looking for you all over.

14:22.194 --> 14:24.238
-Hi, Michelle.
-Judy, where were you?

14:24.321 --> 14:26.532
Oh, we just took a stroll
on the boardwalk. She's fine.

14:26.615 --> 14:28.117
You could have fucking told somebody.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.579
You're right. Sorry.
Your hair looks longer. It's nice.

14:31.662 --> 14:32.955
Thanks. I gave up.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.541
What is this? What are you-- 

14:35.624 --> 14:37.209
Mom, are you drinking a margarita?

14:37.293 --> 14:38.419
I was.

14:38.502 --> 14:41.547
She cannot mix alcohol
with her meds, Judy.

14:41.630 --> 14:43.716
-She told me she wasn't taking any meds.
-She lied.

14:43.799 --> 14:46.218
-Really?
-Great. Now she's wasted.

14:51.432 --> 14:53.183
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.019
I just wanted
to take her for some fresh air.

14:55.102 --> 14:56.604
She's been in the hospital for so long.

14:56.687 --> 14:58.731
Yeah, because she's immunocompromised.

14:58.814 --> 15:00.774
She just had her second stroke, Judy.

15:00.858 --> 15:03.402
What? I… I had no idea.

15:03.485 --> 15:06.405
I'm so sorry. I will--
It-- it won't happen again.

15:06.488 --> 15:08.073
No, it won't.

15:14.580 --> 15:15.664
Hey, Judy, wait.

15:17.499 --> 15:20.753
Can you just tell me
if she had anything else to eat or drink?

15:21.587 --> 15:23.547
Oh, um…

15:23.631 --> 15:25.841
Just the one weak margarita. No salt.

15:25.925 --> 15:29.345
And I did buy her one
very small cup of soft serve.

15:29.428 --> 15:30.471
'Cause it's soft serve.

15:30.554 --> 15:33.390
She loves soft serve.

15:33.474 --> 15:35.309
Who doesn't? Right?

15:35.392 --> 15:37.519
She also asked
for a cherry on top, but I said no.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.730
'Cause I know that
they never wash those cherries.

15:40.314 --> 15:43.901
-Yeah, those cherries are toilet fruit.
-Oh, the grossest.

15:43.984 --> 15:46.278
Don't they, like,
stay in your stomach for, like, 200 years?

15:49.323 --> 15:51.033
I'm so sorry, Michelle.

15:51.116 --> 15:52.910
I know you must think
I'm a horrible person

15:52.993 --> 15:55.829
after everything that Perez--
I mean, uh, Ana, said.

15:55.913 --> 15:58.832
I texted you a bunch.
I don't know if you got 'em.

15:59.917 --> 16:00.834
I did.

16:01.627 --> 16:03.712
Oh, okay. Okay.

16:04.838 --> 16:05.839
Cool.

16:08.592 --> 16:10.469
I really hope your mom is okay.

16:12.388 --> 16:14.223
It was nice to see you.

16:19.687 --> 16:23.899
Hey, she-- she's gonna be fine.
She had a really great time, by the way.

16:23.983 --> 16:24.984
Really?

16:25.818 --> 16:29.571
Yeah, I haven't seen her smile in forever.
It's almost kind of jarring.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.115
I had never seen her teeth before.

16:31.198 --> 16:33.117
-They looked good!

16:33.200 --> 16:35.536
-You look good.

16:36.662 --> 16:38.789
Think it's just the teeth.
They run in the family.

16:38.872 --> 16:41.291
The rest of me
is falling apart at the seams,

16:41.375 --> 16:43.168
I think is the medical term.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.754
I know it can't be easy
with your mom.

16:47.923 --> 16:50.259
It very literally keeps me up at night.

16:51.260 --> 16:55.139
I never knew that I could be
this fucking stressed out about anything.

16:58.684 --> 16:59.893
If you're up for it,

17:00.686 --> 17:02.896
I know somewhere
we can get a weak margarita.

17:03.731 --> 17:05.149
Don't you have to work?

17:05.232 --> 17:06.358
Oh, no, I just got fired.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.069
-Oh, God. Oh, God. I'm so sorry.
-No.

17:09.153 --> 17:10.738
-No. Don't be.
-I can go talk to them.

17:10.821 --> 17:12.781
-That's not--
-Do not be sorry.

17:12.865 --> 17:13.866
I actually, um…

17:14.616 --> 17:16.076
I actually think it's for the best.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.663
Especially if it means
that I get to have a drink with you.

17:24.418 --> 17:25.836
Not a murderer, right?

17:26.670 --> 17:30.090
No! God, no.

17:30.174 --> 17:32.092
I mean, sometimes my jokes kill.

17:34.178 --> 17:35.512
I'll go get my jacket.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.890
<i>Do you know what room you're in?</i>

17:38.640 --> 17:39.933
Um…

17:40.017 --> 17:42.561
Yeah, it seems like some sort of, um,

17:42.644 --> 17:46.190
Victorian nightmare space?

17:46.690 --> 17:49.276
<i>Ah. Okay. I'm coming.</i>

17:52.488 --> 17:53.322
No.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.742
No. Oh.

17:57.534 --> 18:00.204
Okay, what…

18:00.287 --> 18:02.748
This is the twin doll room.

18:03.707 --> 18:06.585
-Because my mother collects twin dolls.
-So there are two of them. Okay.

18:06.668 --> 18:09.088
I just-- because I really thought
I was, like, going… wah!

18:09.171 --> 18:10.047
-No, no.

18:10.130 --> 18:12.424
-And what… why…?

18:12.508 --> 18:14.968
Excellent question.
It all started when we were young.

18:15.052 --> 18:16.762
Steve and I always
had to have the same toy.

18:16.845 --> 18:21.183
And then we grew out of dolls,
and my mom… didn't.

18:21.266 --> 18:22.101
Okay.

18:22.935 --> 18:23.852
Just curious.

18:23.936 --> 18:27.231
Uh, do they actually come as--
as a twin set,

18:27.314 --> 18:28.732
or did she buy…

18:28.816 --> 18:31.401
-No one actually knows.
-Oh, got it. Got it.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.904
Uh, and are… are--

18:33.987 --> 18:36.406
Excuse me, are they supposed to blink?

18:37.074 --> 18:40.160
Because I'm-- I'm pretty sure
a couple of them blinked.

18:40.244 --> 18:41.787
Yeah, I don't…

18:42.496 --> 18:43.872
I don't know. Maybe.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.125
Maybe.

18:50.712 --> 18:51.839
How you doing?

18:52.589 --> 18:53.507
Hmm?

18:56.093 --> 18:57.386
I'm…

18:58.637 --> 19:01.056
I wouldn't say
I'm living my best life, you know.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.309
That makes sense.

19:04.893 --> 19:05.894
Yeah.

19:07.020 --> 19:09.690
I've just been trying to…

19:09.773 --> 19:12.317
…keep it all together for my parents,
you know?

19:12.401 --> 19:15.529
But I'm not sure how much longer
I'm gonna be able to do that. 

19:16.029 --> 19:20.159
Well, maybe you-- you need to let it out.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.204
How do you do that?

19:30.502 --> 19:32.296
-What do you think?

19:33.255 --> 19:35.215
Uh, they're talented.

19:35.299 --> 19:36.216
-Uh…
-You hate it.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.801
No, no, no. I ju-- I--

19:38.302 --> 19:41.513
Maybe I just don't get it?
Uh, what? Do you just--

19:41.597 --> 19:43.682
Do you just kind of scream along with 'em?

19:44.183 --> 19:47.561
Yeah, or just have them scream for you.

19:48.979 --> 19:51.940
-Maybe you just need, like, a deeper cut.

19:52.024 --> 19:55.068
Hmm. Let's see. Something good.

19:55.903 --> 19:59.156
Yeah, you know, I-- I'm actually more
of a classic country kinda guy.

19:59.239 --> 20:01.366
-Ugh.
-Oh.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.410
-Really?

20:03.493 --> 20:05.162
Willie Nelson? Dolly Parton?

20:06.038 --> 20:07.956
I-- I mean, sure…

20:09.374 --> 20:10.417
Here.

20:21.428 --> 20:23.847
I used to listen to this a lot
after Ted died.

20:25.849 --> 20:26.683
Why?

20:27.476 --> 20:28.602
I don't know.

20:30.437 --> 20:33.106
It sounded like… like how I felt.

20:34.524 --> 20:36.401
I wasI was angry.

20:39.404 --> 20:40.739
Can I play you something?

20:41.740 --> 20:43.283
Okay.

20:43.367 --> 20:45.786
Let's see what the future holds.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.833
Oh, the death card. 

20:51.917 --> 20:53.877
-That's weird.
-I mean, it's not literal.

20:53.961 --> 20:56.672
It's more like…
about a big life change, you know?

20:56.755 --> 20:58.090
Yeah, yeah, no, no, I know.

20:58.173 --> 21:01.218
It's just, uh, whew!
He looks a-- a little deathy.

21:01.301 --> 21:05.347
What, the, uh, skeleton
on horseback holding a scythe?

21:05.931 --> 21:07.057
Not comforting?

21:07.140 --> 21:08.767
-Not so much.

21:10.811 --> 21:13.272
-Okay…
-Ooh, that's a lot of knives.

21:13.897 --> 21:14.982
-Wow!
-And a noose.

21:15.065 --> 21:15.941
Yeah, that's a noose.

21:16.024 --> 21:18.610
-You got a lot of shit going on right now.
-Yeah.

21:18.694 --> 21:20.988
Uh, that's an accurate deck.

21:21.071 --> 21:23.949
-Do you wanna talk about it?
-No, I wanna drink about it.

21:25.325 --> 21:26.702
Okay, let's drink about it.

21:30.330 --> 21:33.000
I think that card was meant for me anyway.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.918
-The restaurant closed last week.
-What?

21:35.002 --> 21:35.877
Yeah.

21:35.961 --> 21:37.004
-No!
-Mm-hmm.

21:37.087 --> 21:38.755
That place was so beautiful.

21:39.589 --> 21:42.175
Thanks, but, you know,
it's like how they always say.

21:42.259 --> 21:44.261
When one door closes,

21:44.344 --> 21:47.723
then God just flattens
the fuck out of your town.

21:47.806 --> 21:49.224
-Oh.
-And you gotta move out west.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.976
-Really? Is that what they say?

21:51.059 --> 21:52.311
No, I don't know, probably not.

21:52.394 --> 21:55.814
-I'm really bad at remembering quotes.

21:55.897 --> 22:00.485
Okay, well, since God
just fucking flattened your town,

22:00.569 --> 22:02.279
what, uh, are you gonna do next?

22:03.363 --> 22:04.990
Well…

22:05.073 --> 22:08.327
It's, um, it's early days, but…

22:09.619 --> 22:10.620
Um…

22:11.121 --> 22:12.414
-What? What?

22:12.497 --> 22:15.375
I don't know. I'm having trouble
saying this out loud. It's funny.

22:15.459 --> 22:17.336
Um, okay.

22:18.170 --> 22:23.383
There is an opportunity in Sonoma for me

22:23.467 --> 22:26.595
to possibly open up my own restaurant.

22:26.678 --> 22:28.597
What? Michelle!

22:28.680 --> 22:30.390
-Judy!

22:30.474 --> 22:33.518
I know. It's a really great space,
and it's attached to an organic winery.

22:33.602 --> 22:37.064
I love organic wine! I think.
I don't know if I've ever had it.

22:38.482 --> 22:41.693
I mean, nothing's signed yet,
but it feels good to say it.

22:41.777 --> 22:44.905
It felt good to hear it. Ah!

22:48.283 --> 22:49.409
So what about you?

22:49.951 --> 22:52.496
What about me?

22:52.996 --> 22:56.833
Well, your life is… kind of wide open now.

22:57.667 --> 23:01.922
So, if you could do anything
that you wanted to do, what would you do?

23:08.804 --> 23:09.679
Mm.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.354
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

23:17.854 --> 23:19.648
Do we know what we're doing?

23:20.732 --> 23:22.943
Yeah, I don't know.
I'm not really in a place to like…

23:23.026 --> 23:25.153
Oh, God. No, no, no, not me either.

23:27.072 --> 23:28.490
Okay.

23:36.748 --> 23:39.584
So like, you just-- you just sit around

23:39.668 --> 23:41.461
and just cry to this?

23:44.381 --> 23:46.883
Are you kidding? Definitely yes.

23:46.967 --> 23:47.843
Oh.

23:49.511 --> 23:53.432
-No, it's not that I… always cry to it.
-Mm-hmm.

23:53.515 --> 23:54.599
Sometimes I…

23:55.350 --> 23:57.686
-I sing along.
-Oh.

24:27.048 --> 24:30.469
Yeah, I can see why you… why you like it.

24:31.678 --> 24:32.679
Yeah.

24:37.267 --> 24:39.895
Uh, you know what, um,

24:40.896 --> 24:43.690
what else would help when…
when Ted died was--

24:43.773 --> 24:46.651
is-- is getting up and-- and moving.

24:46.735 --> 24:48.862
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah. Mm-hmm.

24:48.945 --> 24:50.989
I mean, any physical activity

24:51.072 --> 24:54.993
can just be a… a release, you know?

24:56.203 --> 24:57.078
In fact…

24:57.162 --> 24:58.038
…one time,

24:58.121 --> 25:01.291
I smashed a car with a golf club.

25:01.374 --> 25:03.627
-That felt really good.

25:04.711 --> 25:05.545
Really?

25:05.629 --> 25:06.588
-Wow.
-Yeah.

25:06.671 --> 25:07.672
I hope it was your car.

25:07.756 --> 25:09.966
Uh, no. No.

25:10.050 --> 25:14.304
I thought it was the guy who hit Ted.

25:15.555 --> 25:16.765
It wasn't.

25:16.848 --> 25:19.142
But I mean,
I didn't know that at the time.

25:19.893 --> 25:21.269
Oh, got-- gotcha.

25:21.353 --> 25:22.521
Mm-hmm.

25:22.604 --> 25:24.231
I know that's hard.

25:25.148 --> 25:26.274
The not knowing.

25:27.776 --> 25:29.027
Yeah, I know you know.

25:29.861 --> 25:30.862
Sorry.

25:33.031 --> 25:35.659
No, I'm sorry.

25:36.743 --> 25:38.787
Why? You didn't hit him.

25:41.915 --> 25:42.874
No, but I…

25:44.751 --> 25:46.127
I hit you.

25:48.171 --> 25:49.297
What? Uh…

25:49.381 --> 25:51.466
-I don't understand.

25:52.759 --> 25:55.929
-That's 'cause it doesn't make sense.
-Hmm?

25:56.429 --> 25:59.099
But… it was me.

26:00.642 --> 26:01.643
I was--

26:02.561 --> 26:04.145
I was driving the car

26:04.813 --> 26:06.189
that hit you and Judy.

26:08.733 --> 26:11.111
I-- I'd just gotten the call about Steve,

26:11.736 --> 26:14.864
and I started drinking, and I--

26:16.032 --> 26:17.784
I couldn't stop.

26:18.702 --> 26:21.663
I got in my car, and I-- I took off.

26:23.081 --> 26:23.999
And I didn't…

26:25.292 --> 26:26.126
I didn't stop.

26:27.168 --> 26:28.253
And I get it.

26:28.878 --> 26:31.256
You never wanna see me again.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.176
But I had to tell you.

26:45.854 --> 26:49.649
I don't wanna jinx it, but I think
I might actually get some sleep tonight.

26:49.733 --> 26:51.359
I'm so glad.

26:53.278 --> 26:55.447
You really are a happy-maker.
You know that?

26:56.406 --> 26:57.741
You're a happy-maker.

26:58.533 --> 26:59.618
Seriously.

27:00.410 --> 27:01.411
Thank you.

27:02.037 --> 27:03.079
For what?

27:05.540 --> 27:07.751
I didn't know how badly I needed tonight.

27:09.044 --> 27:11.588
It's, like, weirdly cathartic.

27:14.966 --> 27:15.967
Yeah.

27:30.774 --> 27:31.858
I have cancer.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.068
I have cancer.

28:25.036 --> 28:26.037
Wow.
