00:00.772 --> 00:03.295
In New York City's war on crime,

00:03.295 --> 00:06.417
the worst criminal offenders
are pursued by the detectives

00:06.417 --> 00:08.302
of the Major Case Squad.

00:08.302 --> 00:10.025
These are their stories.

00:14.029 --> 00:15.372
It's our house.

00:15.372 --> 00:16.950
You gotta be invited.

00:17.267 --> 00:19.605
You're not. Good-bye.

00:19.887 --> 00:21.719
You need to back off, Charlie.

00:21.719 --> 00:23.909
What are you? Deaf and dumb?

00:23.909 --> 00:25.644
Door, use it.

00:25.644 --> 00:28.430
You need to stop now.

00:32.259 --> 00:35.559
Charlie, you're assaulting a cop.
How dumb is that?

00:38.729 --> 00:40.441
MCS, unit 25!

00:40.441 --> 00:43.624
Signal 10-13 inside at engine 29!

00:43.624 --> 00:46.086
- Officer assaulted!
- Back off!

00:46.086 --> 00:47.722
- All right, all right, all right.
- Back off.

00:47.722 --> 00:49.190
All right, what now?

00:49.420 --> 00:51.067
Charlie, come on, guy.

00:51.067 --> 00:53.561
It's cool. Just let it ride.
It's cool.

00:55.473 --> 00:58.166
Well, you got about 20 seconds.

00:59.265 --> 01:00.523
Screw you.

01:00.523 --> 01:02.988
I don't know about you,
but I don't go that way.

01:04.443 --> 01:05.691
Son of a bitch!

01:05.691 --> 01:08.598
- Get off him!
- Charlie!

01:10.413 --> 01:11.616
Stay out!

01:16.120 --> 01:18.058
- Come on, Charlie!
- Get off!

01:19.473 --> 01:22.834
MCS, unit 25, signal 10-13.

01:22.834 --> 01:24.419
Request assistance!

01:24.419 --> 01:26.939
10-13, officer assaulted.

01:27.708 --> 01:28.949
Break it up.

01:31.981 --> 01:33.556
Don't put your hands on.

02:36.113 --> 02:37.781
What are you doing?

02:38.514 --> 02:41.202
- Leaving.
- They're about to get you a room.

02:41.202 --> 02:43.304
Hand me my pants, will you?

02:44.472 --> 02:45.898
Logan, I'm really sorry that...

02:45.898 --> 02:48.483
Wheeler, two things
I don't need right now.

02:48.483 --> 02:51.535
Another fight or an apology.

02:51.535 --> 02:53.085
Please.

03:01.945 --> 03:03.174
Thanks.

03:12.595 --> 03:15.045
Never gone before the commissioner?

03:17.082 --> 03:21.354
It's kind of like a departmental hearing,
with a few more ribbons.

03:23.052 --> 03:24.620
Wheeler,

03:24.620 --> 03:28.382
don't tell me you've never
had a departmental hearing.

03:29.340 --> 03:32.252
Three firemen were attacking Logan.

03:32.547 --> 03:35.479
Your detective called
a 10-13 in a fire house.

03:35.479 --> 03:38.074
Her partner was in trouble.
She followed procedure.

03:38.074 --> 03:40.247
Then she's the only one who did.

03:41.933 --> 03:46.489
Detectives, I think you know
chief of d's Bradshaw.

03:46.489 --> 03:48.571
And commissioner Fahey.

03:48.571 --> 03:50.876
I've got the mayor calling,
the district attorney,

03:50.876 --> 03:53.231
the fire commissioner, the press,

03:53.231 --> 03:56.336
the PBA, the UFA, the GLBT.

03:56.336 --> 03:58.403
You name the initials.

03:58.403 --> 04:01.034
They all wanna know what happened.

04:01.520 --> 04:04.641
- It's in our report.
- I mean now.

04:04.641 --> 04:07.388
Here. From the beginning.

04:18.988 --> 04:20.767
Wheeler.

04:26.880 --> 04:28.560
A week ago Friday...

04:29.625 --> 04:32.774
Ian Duffy. Eight years on the job.
Worked 9/11.

04:32.774 --> 04:34.071
He was on a night shift.

04:34.071 --> 04:36.210
Staggered out of his car and collapsed.

04:36.210 --> 04:38.627
He just walked in
with multiple stab wounds?

04:38.627 --> 04:40.344
No, he drove.

04:40.592 --> 04:42.612
There's blood all over his car outside.

04:42.612 --> 04:44.417
Okay, guys, uh...

04:44.417 --> 04:46.863
please, just give us a little room.

04:47.648 --> 04:51.710
He's got, like, 20 stab wounds.
Maybe more.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.951
Still got his wallet and his watch.

04:55.951 --> 04:59.081
- You administered CPR?
- No, we were too late.

04:59.081 --> 05:01.641
He'd already bled out
on the way over here.

05:01.967 --> 05:05.076
Guy saved my life. Twice.

05:05.076 --> 05:07.366
- What happened to his hand?
- On his way to work,

05:07.366 --> 05:10.131
some kids were beating up
a drag queen in the West Village.

05:10.131 --> 05:11.611
He intervened.

05:11.611 --> 05:13.486
He take himself to the hospital?

05:13.486 --> 05:16.565
No, um, Charlie drove him.

05:16.565 --> 05:19.426
In Ian's car.
Left him at the ER.

05:19.426 --> 05:22.268
All right, I'll call the 3-5,
get the incident report.

05:22.268 --> 05:25.323
Hey, and we'll need to
get his civvies from the locker.

05:25.323 --> 05:28.905
- Anyone else see the beat-down?
- He was with his wife Claudia.

05:28.905 --> 05:31.315
So Duffy's wife been notified?

05:31.920 --> 05:34.561
Our captain's with her now.
We take care of our own.

05:34.561 --> 05:36.291
Well, we're gonna need to speak to her.

05:36.291 --> 05:39.153
Well, when she's up to it,
I'll let you know.

05:42.407 --> 05:45.913
I'd appreciate if you'd
make that call now, Charlie.

05:50.729 --> 05:53.499
Gay bashing tonight
in the West Village around 8 o'clock.

05:53.499 --> 05:56.881
They took the victim to st. Vincent's.
He's in surgery.

05:57.552 --> 05:59.919
Live through 9/11 to die like that?

05:59.919 --> 06:01.492
Guy was a hero.

06:01.492 --> 06:04.257
Just might have saved
the wrong person this time.

06:06.431 --> 06:08.361
No, not a real gun.

06:08.361 --> 06:11.916
The tall kid pretended to point a gun
like he was going to shoot Ian.

06:11.916 --> 06:16.023
Okay, hold on.
Just tell us how this all started.

06:17.586 --> 06:20.982
Ian and I had gone
to a diner in the Village.

06:22.755 --> 06:25.083
We came around the corner, and...

06:29.573 --> 06:31.816
Hey! Leave her alone!

06:33.166 --> 06:34.446
Ian!

06:36.825 --> 06:39.029
Get off of her!

06:39.192 --> 06:40.683
Ian!

06:57.372 --> 06:58.988
Call 911!

07:01.279 --> 07:03.961
Did you notice anything particular
about these kids?

07:03.961 --> 07:06.510
What they were wearing maybe?

07:06.510 --> 07:08.922
One of them wore glasses.

07:09.151 --> 07:11.132
They broke when Ian hit him.

07:11.132 --> 07:13.015
He, he was bleeding.

07:13.015 --> 07:15.043
Claudia, come on out, huh?

07:21.804 --> 07:23.381
What are you doing with that,
Claudia? Come on.

07:23.381 --> 07:25.234
Mikey, will you get her
a glass of wine?

07:25.234 --> 07:26.891
I'm fine.

07:27.107 --> 07:28.695
So you gonna go after these kids?

07:28.695 --> 07:31.899
We want to get them in an interview room.
Yeah, absolutely.

07:31.899 --> 07:33.557
What a waste.

07:33.891 --> 07:36.197
Ian gets killed for some drag queen?

07:41.213 --> 07:43.067
It's the gay bash victim.

07:43.067 --> 07:45.891
Chanteuse Johnson.
He's out of recovery.

07:49.337 --> 07:51.646
My life's about love.

07:51.646 --> 07:53.883
I don't understand that kind of hate.

07:53.883 --> 07:55.547
All right. Excuse me, sir.

07:55.757 --> 07:57.877
This is a police investigation.

07:58.105 --> 07:59.986
There were two other
gay bashings last week.

07:59.986 --> 08:01.981
Where are the police?

08:02.355 --> 08:05.179
Well, we're here now, Mr...

08:05.179 --> 08:07.435
Phillip Geraldson.
Three Ls, two Ps.

08:07.435 --> 08:09.531
Head of the GLBT defense committee.

08:09.531 --> 08:13.248
Can you remember
anything about these kids, Mr...

08:13.248 --> 08:14.888
Ms.?

08:15.093 --> 08:17.190
Call me Chanteuse, honey.

08:17.190 --> 08:20.703
One of the kids, he wore glasses.
I remember him.

08:20.703 --> 08:22.822
I took a bite out of his arm.

08:22.822 --> 08:24.989
Got a good chunk too.

08:25.682 --> 08:28.666
All right, we'll send
a sketch artist over.

08:28.666 --> 08:31.607
I always get along with artists.

08:32.522 --> 08:33.878
Okay.

08:33.878 --> 08:36.159
Those boys wanted to kill me.

08:36.159 --> 08:38.529
Just for being who I am.

08:38.715 --> 08:42.283
If it weren't for the man
who stopped them, I'd be dead.

08:42.283 --> 08:44.548
I'd like to thank him.

08:46.020 --> 08:47.754
Too late.

08:47.754 --> 08:50.046
He's the one who is dead.

08:59.532 --> 09:02.646
The ME report confirms 22 stab wounds.

09:02.646 --> 09:04.427
None hit a major artery.

09:04.427 --> 09:08.702
Duffy would have been able to drive
for several minutes before bleeding out.

09:08.702 --> 09:12.195
Ian had his hand sewn up by 11.
He didn't get to the firehouse until midnight.

09:12.195 --> 09:13.300
There's a lost hour.

09:13.300 --> 09:15.919
He might have run back into the kids
who did the gay bashing.

09:15.919 --> 09:18.662
We're checking juvenile files
and calling hospitals.

09:18.662 --> 09:19.894
Wheeler.

09:19.894 --> 09:24.990
That's a big leap, from a beat-down
to multiple stab wounds and murder.

09:24.990 --> 09:29.336
Gang initiation.
Threatened manhood.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.801
Teenage boys have killed for less.

09:31.801 --> 09:33.049
Thank you.

09:33.374 --> 09:34.996
The ER nurse from Belvedere says

09:34.996 --> 09:38.990
a Darnell Thomson came in
with busted glasses,

09:38.990 --> 09:41.757
bleeding from his cheek,
a human bite mark on his arm.

09:41.757 --> 09:44.311
Any chance he left a real address?

09:47.224 --> 09:51.768
Darnell just left to
play baseball with his brother Ty.

09:51.768 --> 09:55.262
- Where do they play?
- Central park, at the big ball field.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.417
By themselves?

09:56.417 --> 09:59.227
They might have taken
their friend James with them.

10:13.188 --> 10:16.706
- Are you sure they went to play ball?
- Yes, they took their bats. Why?

10:16.706 --> 10:17.855
Do they belong to a league?

10:17.855 --> 10:20.686
No. Just pickup games.
What's going on?

10:20.686 --> 10:23.230
If they come back, call us.

10:26.687 --> 10:28.940
They took the bats
and left the gloves.

10:28.940 --> 10:31.630
Instead of the ball fields,
they may be headed to the rambles.

10:31.630 --> 10:33.002
Is that still a gay pickup spot?

10:33.002 --> 10:34.662
80 years and counting.

10:35.354 --> 10:36.919
MCS unit 25.

10:36.919 --> 10:38.856
We're on our way
to Central park drive and 78.

10:38.856 --> 10:41.900
Request signal 10-11 backup forthwith.

10:46.557 --> 10:50.352
Dispatch have just received two reports
of gang activity in the rambles.

11:05.292 --> 11:06.400
Police!

11:06.400 --> 11:08.963
Don't move! Don't move!

11:11.444 --> 11:13.556
Up, up, up, up, up, up!

12:17.892 --> 12:20.844
Don't make me climb that tree.

12:22.493 --> 12:25.509
All right, fun's over.
Get out of there.

12:29.001 --> 12:30.533
All three boys denied everything,

12:30.533 --> 12:33.145
but Darnell's injuries
were consistent with the fight,

12:33.145 --> 12:35.001
and Duffy's wife ID'd them.

12:35.001 --> 12:36.725
For the gay bash?

12:37.615 --> 12:40.170
I am assuming you put the juveniles
in non-threatening rooms,

12:40.170 --> 12:41.598
and that their mothers were present?

12:41.598 --> 12:43.621
Darnell's 16.
We put him in interrogation.

12:43.621 --> 12:45.467
But the others...

12:45.823 --> 12:48.664
James and Tyrone were with their moms.

12:49.718 --> 12:51.537
This one...

12:51.821 --> 12:53.352
he's my boy's age.

12:53.352 --> 12:56.413
James Decker, 14.
He's not too swift.

12:56.413 --> 12:58.151
Well, here's the big surprise.

12:58.151 --> 13:00.369
James says it wasn't his idea.

13:00.369 --> 13:02.565
That he was too afraid to say no.

13:02.565 --> 13:03.785
Excuse me.

13:04.116 --> 13:06.102
You gonna talk to my boys?

13:06.102 --> 13:08.663
This is Mrs. Thomson,
Darnell and Ty's mother.

13:08.663 --> 13:10.298
Make sure you go hard on them.

13:10.298 --> 13:11.926
I don't want to
see them in here again.

13:11.926 --> 13:14.804
Okay, ma'am, you need
to be in the room with Ty.

13:17.335 --> 13:19.303
Mother knows best.

13:20.064 --> 13:21.377
I don't recall.

13:21.377 --> 13:23.377
Don't recall?

13:23.377 --> 13:26.855
You better tell the truth, Ty.
Now!

13:32.296 --> 13:34.195
I only did it 'cause of Darnell.

13:34.195 --> 13:36.947
If I don't do what he says,
he beats me up.

13:36.947 --> 13:38.635
So it was self-defense.

13:38.635 --> 13:40.295
Against your brother?

13:40.295 --> 13:43.567
You gonna need some
self-defense against me.

13:45.114 --> 13:47.169
Now, here's a guy
who's just like you.

13:47.169 --> 13:49.147
Same skin color.
Same neighborhood.

13:49.147 --> 13:51.623
That faggot ain't nothing like me!

13:52.192 --> 13:55.707
You're 16 years old.
You know what that means, don't you?

13:55.707 --> 13:58.144
There's no more family court.

14:01.857 --> 14:05.044
He grabbed my crotch, all right?
I had to chunk him.

14:05.044 --> 14:06.409
How convenient.

14:06.409 --> 14:08.223
What about the guy
that broke your glasses?

14:08.223 --> 14:09.673
What about him?

14:09.673 --> 14:11.266
He's dead.

14:11.945 --> 14:13.686
He was alive when he attacked me.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.813
How about around 11,
the next time you ran into him?

14:15.813 --> 14:17.292
Ah, that's not right.

14:17.292 --> 14:19.405
I was home. Curfew.

14:19.405 --> 14:21.386
You didn't make a gesture?

14:21.386 --> 14:24.536
Like this, as you ran away?

14:25.356 --> 14:28.212
What if I did?
I don't have a gun.

14:28.212 --> 14:30.661
- He was stabbed.
- Not by me.

14:30.661 --> 14:33.378
After I went to the ER for the bite
that bitch gave me,

14:33.378 --> 14:35.302
I went home and watched TV.

14:35.302 --> 14:36.917
Remember what you were watching?

14:36.917 --> 14:40.000
Yeah, this show where white people
were getting bad face lifts.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.877
Ask my mom.

14:44.940 --> 14:46.633
Nice kids, huh?

14:47.715 --> 14:50.330
At least they didn't set Chanteuse on fire.

14:50.330 --> 14:52.651
Think they're good for Duffy's murder?

14:53.303 --> 14:55.867
- Doubt it.
- Me too.

14:55.867 --> 14:57.946
But that tie that Duffy wore...

14:57.946 --> 14:59.837
tested positive for Darnell's blood.

14:59.837 --> 15:02.568
Kid'll do hard time for the hate crime.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.359
Duffy's wife still around?

15:04.359 --> 15:06.140
In my office.

15:15.855 --> 15:16.983
Was it them?

15:16.983 --> 15:18.629
Did he confess?

15:19.193 --> 15:21.278
Not to the stabbing.

15:21.507 --> 15:24.392
But we've ID'd blood from one of the boys
on your husband's street clothes

15:24.392 --> 15:26.413
from the beating in the Village.

15:26.413 --> 15:30.830
Your husband was wearing
a suit and a tie to a diner.

15:30.830 --> 15:32.574
He was at a press conference
that afternoon.

15:32.574 --> 15:34.550
I met him right after.

15:34.550 --> 15:36.271
Press conference?

15:36.271 --> 15:37.517
He was an activist.

15:37.517 --> 15:41.036
On behalf of firemen from 9/11
who have health problems.

15:41.036 --> 15:45.444
That afternoon, he was protesting the
release of the 9/11 health guidelines.

15:45.444 --> 15:47.944
He said it was like spitting on a fire.

15:47.944 --> 15:50.990
- How active was he?
- He was passionate.

15:50.990 --> 15:52.928
Meetings, rallies.

15:52.928 --> 15:56.578
He even got arrested with this group,
Forgotten heroes.

15:56.578 --> 15:59.792
Spent four or five nights
a week with them.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.520
Did anybody get mad over that?

16:01.520 --> 16:03.543
Besides me?

16:04.139 --> 16:06.223
Just the entire city government.

16:06.223 --> 16:07.757
Was he ever threatened?

16:07.757 --> 16:09.607
Not that I know of, but...

16:09.607 --> 16:12.818
firemen don't like to worry their wives.

16:13.993 --> 16:16.341
The city is lying!
People are dying!

16:16.341 --> 16:18.501
The city is lying!
People are dying!

16:18.501 --> 16:21.830
- Mr. Duffy, you can't interrupt.
- You're throwing me out?

16:21.830 --> 16:23.605
They should throw you out!

16:23.605 --> 16:25.185
Guy had balls.

16:25.185 --> 16:28.598
- We're doing everything we can.
- You're doing nothing!

16:28.598 --> 16:32.389
Johnson, Zeller, Rivera, all dead!

16:33.201 --> 16:34.913
Uh, freeze that.

16:35.216 --> 16:36.552
You see that?

16:36.802 --> 16:41.139
He looks like he's signaling Ian
that he's on his side.

16:41.139 --> 16:42.901
- See that?
- Mm-hmm.

16:46.783 --> 16:49.184
Then maybe he knows who wasn't.

16:49.917 --> 16:51.545
Ian was furious.

16:51.545 --> 16:53.322
His brothers are getting sick.

16:53.322 --> 16:56.957
Dropping dead and the city
just wants to cut them loose.

16:56.957 --> 16:58.484
Don't you work for the city?

16:58.484 --> 17:00.980
Physician assistant.
Health department.

17:00.980 --> 17:04.887
They only give me the resources
to record findings and make referrals.

17:04.887 --> 17:06.806
It's just CYA.

17:06.806 --> 17:08.695
The real death toll is just starting.

17:08.695 --> 17:11.714
So at the press conference,
you were showing your support?

17:11.714 --> 17:12.728
Yeah.

17:12.728 --> 17:14.874
Ian was a good man.

17:14.874 --> 17:16.935
He was a fighter.

17:17.161 --> 17:20.229
You think that had something
to do with his murder?

17:20.561 --> 17:21.438
Do you?

17:21.438 --> 17:24.840
Oh, well, politicians had no trouble
turning their backs on these heroes.

17:24.840 --> 17:28.077
I guess they could stab one.

17:28.077 --> 17:31.583
So you and Ian were involved
with the Forgotten heroes group?

17:31.583 --> 17:34.186
Yep. Their office is near the firehouse.

17:34.186 --> 17:36.407
Ian gave a lot of his time to help out.

17:36.407 --> 17:38.405
Was Ian there a lot last week?

17:38.405 --> 17:40.567
Couple nights, I guess.

17:40.567 --> 17:43.336
His wife said four or five.

17:43.336 --> 17:45.031
Wait, yeah.

17:45.180 --> 17:47.022
Yeah, that sounds right.

17:47.367 --> 17:49.668
This is a homicide
investigation, Mr. Keele.

17:49.668 --> 17:52.115
You need to be straight with us.

17:52.609 --> 17:56.516
Uh, look, I'm sure his wife
has a better memory of his...

17:56.516 --> 17:58.147
schedule than I do.

17:58.147 --> 18:00.055
No, she only knows
when he wasn't home.

18:00.055 --> 18:02.443
You know whether he was at work or...

18:02.443 --> 18:04.676
if you were covering for him.

18:06.245 --> 18:07.772
He was a good man.

18:07.772 --> 18:10.236
And good men sometimes
have a piece on the side

18:10.236 --> 18:12.895
and ask their friends to lie for them.

18:14.193 --> 18:15.966
Not Ian.

18:16.515 --> 18:20.348
Hell of a friend doesn't wanna
give him up, even though he's dead.

18:21.699 --> 18:23.834
If he was seeing someone,

18:23.834 --> 18:27.994
the nearest doughnut theory
says she lives near the firehouse.

18:27.994 --> 18:29.391
The what?

18:29.670 --> 18:31.090
Men are lazy.

18:31.090 --> 18:32.767
Even if there's a good meal across town,

18:32.767 --> 18:35.580
they'll usually just reach
for the nearest doughnut.

18:37.983 --> 18:38.828
Sounds about right.

18:38.828 --> 18:41.521
In which case, he probably
met her at the nearest bar.

18:43.697 --> 18:46.733
14 bars within 10 blocks.

18:46.733 --> 18:48.659
I hit 12.
You got anything?

18:48.659 --> 18:51.367
Oh, just a few clowns
asking for my number.

18:51.367 --> 18:54.025
That's funny, all they
asked me to do was leave.

18:54.581 --> 18:57.032
Maybe he met her at her apartment.

18:57.963 --> 19:00.638
So, what, are we gonna
knock on 2,000 doors?

19:00.638 --> 19:02.595
Not tonight, we're not.

19:03.036 --> 19:05.554
How about Julian's?
Did you go in there?

19:09.432 --> 19:11.200
You're kidding, right?

19:17.247 --> 19:20.375
Two nights a week.
Sometimes more.

19:20.375 --> 19:22.877
Stopped coming about three months ago.

19:22.877 --> 19:24.738
You sure it was this guy?

19:24.738 --> 19:26.635
I got baby blues with 20/20.

19:26.635 --> 19:29.693
Liked his beer dark
and his whisky Irish.

19:29.693 --> 19:31.653
Most nights, he left here alone.

19:31.653 --> 19:34.298
And when he did, he broke
every heart in the room.

19:36.215 --> 19:37.813
He's gay?

19:47.578 --> 19:51.044
And so, armed with this piece
of bartender's gossip,

19:51.044 --> 19:54.332
you took it upon yourselves
to go the firehouse

19:54.332 --> 19:57.985
and out Duffy to his brothers?

19:57.985 --> 20:01.804
Commissioner, my detectives did
everything they could to avoid that.

20:01.804 --> 20:04.988
I instructed Wheeler to go
back to Duffy's widow.

20:06.053 --> 20:09.322
And to discreetly ask
about their marriage.

20:09.535 --> 20:11.715
We met in ninth grade home room.

20:11.715 --> 20:13.348
He played soccer.

20:13.348 --> 20:15.302
And the guitar.

20:15.302 --> 20:17.235
All the girls liked him.

20:17.235 --> 20:19.213
I never knew why he picked me.

20:19.213 --> 20:21.014
What did he say?

20:21.525 --> 20:24.599
- That I was special.
- And how were things lately?

20:24.599 --> 20:27.796
Do you mind if we sit down?
I'm not feeling so well.

20:37.240 --> 20:39.074
Claudia, are you...

20:39.074 --> 20:41.683
Yeah. Pregnant.

20:41.683 --> 20:43.964
Found out right before.

20:45.434 --> 20:48.481
Oh, god, it's my fault.
Maybe it's my fault.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.581
What do you mean?

20:52.709 --> 20:55.149
I'd known for a while
the way he'd been.

20:55.149 --> 20:56.890
There was someone else.

20:56.890 --> 20:59.773
I hadn't said anything.
I always...

20:59.773 --> 21:02.924
felt like I was lucky
just to have him.

21:03.223 --> 21:05.902
And then you found out
you were pregnant?

21:05.902 --> 21:08.855
And I knew I had to deal with it.

21:08.855 --> 21:10.903
We went out to dinner.

21:10.903 --> 21:13.148
I told him I was pregnant.

21:13.148 --> 21:16.533
And that, whatever was going on,
it had to stop.

21:16.533 --> 21:18.459
Now.

21:18.936 --> 21:20.969
Did he tell you this person's name?

21:20.969 --> 21:22.182
No.

21:22.182 --> 21:24.399
Anything at all?

21:24.692 --> 21:27.297
He just said he loved me.

21:27.297 --> 21:29.950
And that she didn't
mean anything to him.

21:29.950 --> 21:32.733
And that he was gonna end it.

21:35.597 --> 21:37.827
It wasn't a quickie
in the back seat of a car.

21:37.827 --> 21:39.718
It was a three-month affair.

21:39.718 --> 21:42.116
And when Ian tried to end it,
his lover went off.

21:42.116 --> 21:43.902
A passion crime.

21:44.121 --> 21:45.866
Gay rage.

21:45.866 --> 21:47.595
Old school police term.

21:47.595 --> 21:48.924
We don't use it anymore,

21:48.924 --> 21:50.220
and I don't want to hear it
from either of you,

21:50.220 --> 21:53.085
but back in the day,
that's what everyone called it.

21:53.085 --> 21:57.253
The strength of a man
with the hysteria of a woman.

21:59.924 --> 22:01.077
Apologies.

22:01.077 --> 22:02.943
How about just calling it crazy?

22:02.943 --> 22:04.756
Once this guy started stabbing,
he couldn't stop.

22:04.756 --> 22:07.616
22 times, in the chest.

22:07.616 --> 22:10.944
Chest only, not the face or the back?

22:13.500 --> 22:16.360
There was a case 12 years ago
at the 3-5.

22:16.360 --> 22:20.018
Married man, 20-something.
Stabs...

22:20.018 --> 22:22.162
all to the chest.

22:22.162 --> 22:25.757
Homicide figured gay love gone bad.

22:25.757 --> 22:28.902
But the wife denied it.
Case went nowhere.

22:28.902 --> 22:31.697
Victim's name was...

22:31.697 --> 22:33.345
John T. Hoffman.

22:33.345 --> 22:35.048
12 years, and you remember his name?

22:35.048 --> 22:39.972
Same name as one of two New York city
mayors who went on to become governor.

22:39.972 --> 22:44.626
John T. Hoffman murdered in '94.
Case cleared two years ago.

22:44.840 --> 22:46.223
They get a verdict?

22:46.223 --> 22:47.809
No, it's an exceptional clearance.

22:47.809 --> 22:51.146
A convict pled out, died last year.

22:54.317 --> 22:57.581
- What?
- Who was the detective?

22:57.926 --> 23:00.606
- Steven Grubman.
- Huh.

23:00.606 --> 23:02.935
Talk about old school.

23:02.935 --> 23:05.203
Don't tell him I say hi.

23:05.875 --> 23:10.676
Logan, why don't you go
be his old school buddy?

23:10.676 --> 23:12.396
Oh, yeah, I'm all over this.

23:12.396 --> 23:15.598
And, Wheeler, play young.

23:21.495 --> 23:23.161
That case was a stinker.

23:23.161 --> 23:26.431
Finally got a close
on an exceptional clearance.

23:26.431 --> 23:28.340
Can you go over that?

23:28.340 --> 23:30.369
How old's your partner, ten?

23:31.120 --> 23:35.491
That's when you classify a case
as solved without making an arrest.

23:36.655 --> 23:37.973
Boss was on our ass.

23:37.973 --> 23:39.982
Clearance rate was below 50%.

23:39.982 --> 23:42.268
I was two months out of retirement.

23:42.268 --> 23:45.330
So we opened the drawer,
pulled out an old case,

23:45.330 --> 23:46.561
and we solved it.

23:46.561 --> 23:47.933
How?

23:47.933 --> 23:50.886
You drove all the way
to Rocklin county for this?

23:51.077 --> 23:53.014
We're looking for a similar M.O.

23:53.014 --> 23:55.880
You know, it's another
misdemeanor homicide.

23:55.880 --> 23:57.393
A what?

23:57.623 --> 23:58.964
What am I, a dictionary?

23:58.964 --> 24:02.372
It was the early '90s.
2,000 homicides a year.

24:02.372 --> 24:04.976
Some guy gets stabbed
on a pier by a hustler,

24:04.976 --> 24:06.786
not a priority.

24:06.786 --> 24:08.484
But then two years ago...

24:08.484 --> 24:10.503
We took another look at it.

24:10.503 --> 24:14.143
I had a con upstate,
a lifer with health problems.

24:14.143 --> 24:16.110
He wanted to be transferred.

24:16.110 --> 24:18.357
He pled out to Hoffman's murder.

24:18.357 --> 24:21.744
The victim's wife and kid
thought justice was served.

24:21.744 --> 24:22.916
Our solve rate went up.

24:22.916 --> 24:25.169
And everybody's a winner, okay?

24:25.567 --> 24:26.729
Thank you.

24:26.729 --> 24:28.578
Hey, give Ross my warmest regards.

24:28.578 --> 24:30.273
You got it.
Come on, let's go.

24:31.394 --> 24:35.163
You know what gets me?
This bum is sitting on a pension for life.

24:35.518 --> 24:37.938
Well, in those days, it was triage.

24:37.938 --> 24:40.605
Guys like that,
that's how they got by.

24:40.605 --> 24:42.261
And these days?

24:42.784 --> 24:44.445
We do what Grubman
should have done.

24:44.445 --> 24:45.895
Examine the case.

24:45.895 --> 24:47.667
Hoffman was married.

24:47.667 --> 24:49.307
Let's start with the widow.

24:49.307 --> 24:51.100
She lives in Philly.

24:56.999 --> 25:01.493
You stroll in and want me to shatter
what I've put back together?

25:01.493 --> 25:03.457
I was devastated back then.

25:03.457 --> 25:05.534
And now it would devastate my son.

25:05.534 --> 25:08.513
Mrs. Hoffman, there's just
been a similar murder.

25:08.513 --> 25:11.354
Another woman lost her husband.

25:11.354 --> 25:15.351
We're not asking you to help us.
We're asking you to help her.

25:30.182 --> 25:32.382
I will not repeat this.

25:32.382 --> 25:34.749
I will not testify.

25:37.047 --> 25:39.199
My son will not know.

25:39.199 --> 25:40.688
Okay.

25:43.212 --> 25:45.124
John...

25:46.246 --> 25:49.198
he traveled to New York on business.

25:49.443 --> 25:51.408
Frequently.

25:52.060 --> 25:56.688
When confronted, he admitted
to being involved with a man.

25:57.365 --> 26:00.424
I told him he had to end it.

26:00.424 --> 26:03.341
He went back to New York.

26:03.929 --> 26:06.324
He never came back.

26:06.986 --> 26:08.706
Did you know who this man was?

26:08.706 --> 26:12.101
- No.
- Anything about him?

26:12.706 --> 26:14.717
I don't, I'm sorry.

26:14.717 --> 26:16.438
Is this your son?

26:16.438 --> 26:18.150
John, Jr.

26:18.444 --> 26:20.062
How old is he?

26:20.062 --> 26:21.731
11.

26:21.731 --> 26:24.102
Did he ever know his father?

26:26.259 --> 26:28.000
No.

26:28.333 --> 26:31.599
I was pregnant when John...

26:34.997 --> 26:38.266
Well, it's deja vu all over again.

26:38.266 --> 26:40.525
Hoffman was a married man,
deep in the closet,

26:40.525 --> 26:42.756
- and his wife got pregnant.
- He's our guy.

26:42.756 --> 26:45.469
He falls for unavailable men.
Their wives get pregnant.

26:45.469 --> 26:47.671
The one thing he can't do...
and he can't bear the rejection.

26:47.671 --> 26:48.924
He flips out.

26:48.924 --> 26:50.845
Any leads in Hoffman's file?

26:50.845 --> 26:52.570
Another compartmentalized guy.

26:52.570 --> 26:55.019
No one in his life
knew about his other life.

26:55.019 --> 26:58.565
And two partial prints on Hoffman's
belt from the crime scene?

26:58.565 --> 26:59.669
No matches.

26:59.669 --> 27:03.243
You know what? I don't care how
compartmentalized Duffy was.

27:03.243 --> 27:05.754
One of his firemen buddies
knows something.

27:05.754 --> 27:07.820
Even if he doesn't wanna
know something.

27:07.820 --> 27:11.181
Hell, it could even be
one of his firemen buddies.

27:12.847 --> 27:14.267
Come here.

27:17.293 --> 27:20.646
You two know the interdepartmental history.

27:20.646 --> 27:25.655
We are entering extremely
complicated territory.

27:26.044 --> 27:29.020
Now, I'll call their lieutenant
and clear it with him.

27:29.020 --> 27:30.694
But go easy with these guys.

27:30.694 --> 27:33.397
Three strokes before you kick.

27:33.676 --> 27:37.210
If it turns ugly, let Wheeler talk.

27:37.837 --> 27:41.179
You know, police, fire.
We're all on the same team.

27:41.179 --> 27:43.013
Basically.

27:44.044 --> 27:48.721
Logan, someone tells me you're gay,
I don't care.

27:48.721 --> 27:52.156
But the FDNY is not the NYPD.

27:52.156 --> 27:55.325
These men work together,
cook together, live together.

27:55.325 --> 27:57.243
There's a code.

27:57.243 --> 27:59.111
We clear?

27:59.111 --> 28:00.722
No worries.

28:01.043 --> 28:02.588
Screw you!

28:02.908 --> 28:05.460
I don't know about you,
but I don't go that way.

28:08.731 --> 28:12.095
MCS, unit 25! Signal 10-13!

28:12.095 --> 28:13.506
Request assistance!

28:16.447 --> 28:18.274
Come on, come on.

28:18.274 --> 28:19.535
Police, back off!

28:19.535 --> 28:22.216
Hey, this is Mikey at engine 29.
We got a brawl with the cops.

28:22.216 --> 28:23.858
Get your guys down here now!

28:50.563 --> 28:54.652
Commissioner, we did everything
possible too avoid what happened.

28:55.973 --> 28:57.683
Absolutely.

29:00.259 --> 29:02.176
We'll be in touch.

29:02.176 --> 29:04.992
Detectives, give us a minute
with your captain.

29:14.168 --> 29:15.516
Detectives.

29:28.473 --> 29:30.891
Unfortunately, we now
have two cases to deal with.

29:30.891 --> 29:34.418
The murder and
the felony assault on you.

29:34.418 --> 29:36.044
Felony assault?

29:36.044 --> 29:38.071
The fireman who threw the first punch,

29:38.071 --> 29:40.788
the commissioner
wants to send a message.

29:43.718 --> 29:45.841
I didn't see who did that.

29:46.238 --> 29:47.721
Did you, Wheeler?

29:47.721 --> 29:50.002
I must have been on the radio.

29:50.002 --> 29:52.001
Pick someone.

29:52.454 --> 29:56.385
In the meantime, I'd say
you two touched a nerve.

29:56.385 --> 29:58.627
It might just be homophobia.

29:58.627 --> 30:00.673
It might be someone was
overcompensating.

30:00.673 --> 30:03.343
If Duffy was having an in-house affair,

30:03.343 --> 30:05.985
one of the men who attacked you
might be the murderer.

30:05.985 --> 30:08.298
You want us to go back and ask?

30:09.083 --> 30:13.321
If he was leading a double life
with someone in the firehouse,

30:13.321 --> 30:16.023
they'd have had the perfect cover.

30:16.023 --> 30:18.272
Claudia, his wife.

30:18.272 --> 30:21.317
She doesn't know who Duffy's lover was,
but she'll know who his best friend was.

30:21.317 --> 30:24.615
Who he talked about.
Who called his home.

30:24.615 --> 30:25.856
Play it close to the vest.

30:25.856 --> 30:28.273
If she knows why you're asking,

30:28.273 --> 30:30.131
she's gonna put her guard up.

30:30.600 --> 30:33.175
I hear you got knocked
around pretty good.

30:33.423 --> 30:35.548
Yeah, well, those guys, they're, uh,

30:35.548 --> 30:37.036
they're as tough as they look.

30:37.036 --> 30:39.320
You got what you deserved.

30:39.788 --> 30:41.816
The only reason why I'm talking to you

30:41.816 --> 30:46.067
is 'cause I want you to know
you're wrong about my husband.

30:46.067 --> 30:48.179
He wasn't gay.

30:49.262 --> 30:52.320
Your husband was
a regular at a gay bar.

30:52.707 --> 30:54.287
The bartender knew his favorite drinks.

30:54.287 --> 30:57.131
That's a lie.
He's lying.

30:57.871 --> 31:02.132
Dark beer. Irish whisky.

31:02.442 --> 31:06.893
He also told us Ian stopped coming in
about three months ago.

31:06.893 --> 31:09.911
That's about when you started to think
he was having an affair.

31:09.911 --> 31:11.917
No, I, I would have known.

31:11.917 --> 31:15.083
Look, the guy who stabbed your husband,
he's done it before.

31:15.083 --> 31:16.417
12 years ago.

31:16.417 --> 31:18.321
To a married businessman
whose wife was pregnant,

31:18.321 --> 31:20.552
the night the man
tried to end the affair.

31:20.552 --> 31:21.537
Stop it!

31:21.537 --> 31:23.839
You're lying. Stop it!

31:28.804 --> 31:31.123
Mrs. Duffy, I'm sorry.

31:31.123 --> 31:33.712
We're trying to get this guy.

31:33.912 --> 31:36.032
We need your help.

31:40.291 --> 31:42.325
I can't help you.

31:43.281 --> 31:46.241
This doesn't make any sense.

31:46.613 --> 31:50.063
Claudia, was there anyone
that Ian talked about?

31:50.063 --> 31:52.117
Like a friend?

31:52.117 --> 31:55.047
No, just the guys, his brothers.

31:55.047 --> 31:57.238
Who was his best friend?

31:57.238 --> 32:00.421
Someone maybe he went away
with once in a while.

32:00.421 --> 32:02.616
I don't know how to help you.

32:02.616 --> 32:04.191
It's all wrong.

32:04.866 --> 32:07.340
My husband loved me.

32:07.956 --> 32:10.318
I won't talk about this. No.

32:10.318 --> 32:12.983
Is this your husband being arrested?

32:12.983 --> 32:14.631
At a rally, with Brendan.

32:14.631 --> 32:16.444
The charges were dropped.

32:16.692 --> 32:18.635
The charges were dropped.

32:26.650 --> 32:28.899
The city is lying!
People are dying!

32:28.899 --> 32:31.176
The city is lying!
People are dying!

32:31.176 --> 32:33.553
Mr. Duffy, you can't interrupt.

32:33.553 --> 32:35.817
You throw me out?
They should throw...

32:50.670 --> 32:52.657
They have the same tie.

32:53.933 --> 32:56.283
That doesn't mean they were lovers.

32:57.006 --> 32:58.852
Let's ask the wife.

32:58.852 --> 33:00.796
I'm gonna bet she doesn't know
where he got it.

33:00.796 --> 33:03.597
Duffy wore his at the press conference.

33:04.736 --> 33:07.259
Maybe it was some kind of signal...

33:07.259 --> 33:10.062
to let Brendan know
they were gonna meet up later.

33:10.062 --> 33:13.415
Where do you get this?
Some kind of scared straight video?

33:14.604 --> 33:16.324
Look at your screen.

33:20.704 --> 33:24.471
"Brendan Keele.
Acquitted for assault in Vermont."

33:24.471 --> 33:26.632
He stabbed his college roommate
with a letter opener.

33:26.632 --> 33:29.224
Got off on self-defense.

33:29.224 --> 33:30.951
The prints on the Hoffman murder,

33:30.951 --> 33:33.492
- how partial are they?
- Let's run them again.

33:33.492 --> 33:37.098
Been a lot of updates to the system
in the last 12 years.

33:43.303 --> 33:46.383
Hoffman's partials matched
Brendan Keele's prints from Vermont.

33:46.383 --> 33:47.703
It's him.

33:47.703 --> 33:48.611
Congratulations.

33:48.611 --> 33:51.662
You've just solved a closed case
where a different defendant pled out

33:51.662 --> 33:55.010
and subsequently died in prison.

33:55.010 --> 33:56.867
They got the wrong guy.

33:57.086 --> 33:58.276
Can we reopen?

33:58.276 --> 34:00.117
Find me a DA who'll take this to court,

34:00.117 --> 34:02.840
and I'll show you a DA
who's about to lose his job.

34:02.840 --> 34:07.406
Well, we have the same pattern
and the same motive, the same M.O.

34:07.406 --> 34:10.165
Every time this guy
feels rejected, he goes off.

34:10.165 --> 34:12.472
The jury won't be told Keele's history.

34:12.472 --> 34:16.645
We have to find some other way
to out this guy as a murderer.

34:21.819 --> 34:23.634
You know, uh...

34:24.188 --> 34:29.170
I think I might remember who it was
who took that first swing at me.

34:31.522 --> 34:33.391
Mind if I bring him in?

34:33.594 --> 34:34.962
By all means.

34:34.962 --> 34:37.050
But this time, do it carefully.

34:37.050 --> 34:38.322
Yeah.

34:38.322 --> 34:41.742
How about some fresh parmesan,
plus a half pound of pancetta,

34:41.742 --> 34:44.438
uh, pound of prosciut, and, uh...

34:44.438 --> 34:45.856
one of those mozzarellas.

34:45.856 --> 34:47.210
Jeez, why don't you guys
get out of here

34:47.210 --> 34:49.538
so some of us get a chance?

34:50.322 --> 34:51.784
What the hell do you want?

34:51.784 --> 34:55.237
Put your hands on the counter,
Charlie. Slowly.

35:53.098 --> 35:55.641
So what's going on?
You want to get into it right here?

35:55.641 --> 35:57.012
No, Charlie.

35:57.382 --> 35:59.117
I need a favor.

36:00.978 --> 36:02.727
A really big favor.

36:10.837 --> 36:13.419
Mrs. Duffy, how's she holding up?

36:13.419 --> 36:14.920
She's okay.

36:19.728 --> 36:22.087
Hey, look, I'm not gonna...
I'm not gonna have to...

36:22.087 --> 36:25.399
Just be your normal,
charming self, Charlie.

36:32.771 --> 36:34.590
Thank you, Mrs. Duffy.

36:35.185 --> 36:36.699
Hey, Claudia.

36:36.699 --> 36:38.174
Don't.

36:40.272 --> 36:43.698
She found out you were
covering for the affair.

36:45.996 --> 36:49.464
Mr. Keele, as you know,
we're very close to an arrest.

36:49.464 --> 36:52.759
And we think it's someone you're
familiar with and will be able to identify.

36:52.759 --> 36:55.705
Oh, I'm glad you made headway.

36:56.406 --> 36:58.768
Mrs. Duffy has given us
her written statement,

36:58.768 --> 37:00.850
which I hope you can confirm.

37:00.850 --> 37:02.263
Okay.

37:02.814 --> 37:07.830
"On the night my husband was killed,
I told him he had to end the affair."

37:07.830 --> 37:10.711
"But he refused.
He said he was leaving me,"

37:10.711 --> 37:16.407
"that he wanted a divorce
'cause he was in love with someone else."

37:16.407 --> 37:18.245
Going on.

37:18.245 --> 37:20.725
"He knew how much
I wanted to have children."

37:20.725 --> 37:24.666
"And he'd never agree
to have a baby with me."

37:25.702 --> 37:30.695
Now, Mrs. Duffy picked out
the man from a lineup.

37:30.695 --> 37:32.935
Uh, I can't tell you who, of course.

37:32.935 --> 37:37.455
But you said you knew
that Ian was having an affair.

37:43.225 --> 37:47.309
Do you recognize any of
these men as Ian's lover?

37:47.309 --> 37:50.342
- No. What?
- Let's try again.

37:50.342 --> 37:54.175
Did you ever see Ian
with any of these men?

37:57.259 --> 38:00.169
Well, of course.
That's, um...

38:00.169 --> 38:02.153
That's Charlie.
They worked together.

38:02.153 --> 38:03.795
Charlie Hugo?

38:03.795 --> 38:06.943
Uh, can you tell us which number he is?

38:08.393 --> 38:10.903
Um, he's number three.

38:10.903 --> 38:12.735
You know that.

38:18.197 --> 38:23.649
And you know that Ian was having
an affair with Charlie Hugo?

38:23.649 --> 38:25.487
No.

38:29.836 --> 38:32.098
You okay, Mr. Keele?

38:32.434 --> 38:36.524
Maybe Charlie did kill him.
They were together a lot.

38:38.190 --> 38:41.267
He's your suspect.
He did it.

38:41.456 --> 38:42.778
I'm just saying...

38:42.778 --> 38:44.174
they weren't a couple.

38:44.174 --> 38:47.790
- Brendan, Claudia knows.
- No, she doesn't.

38:47.790 --> 38:50.027
It's in her statement, uh,

38:50.027 --> 38:53.274
"Ian told me how much
he and Charlie had in common."

38:53.274 --> 38:57.359
"How he respected him.
How they were in love."

38:57.677 --> 38:59.593
She said that?

38:59.593 --> 39:00.731
Well, it makes sense.

39:00.731 --> 39:05.318
A big, handsome guy like that, I mean,
best firefighter in the house.

39:05.318 --> 39:06.757
I mean...

39:06.757 --> 39:09.522
I'm straight, but, uh...

39:12.205 --> 39:14.747
Well, it looks like it's over, Charlie.

39:14.747 --> 39:17.244
I'm telling you,
you got it wrong.

39:17.991 --> 39:20.540
Two plane tickets to
cape Cod, Massachusetts.

39:20.540 --> 39:24.140
It's the only state that
allows men to get married.

39:24.453 --> 39:26.319
Are these yours?

39:26.939 --> 39:28.666
Come on, Charlie!

39:28.666 --> 39:31.098
They got names on them.

39:34.252 --> 39:35.792
He's done.

39:37.393 --> 39:42.236
I, um, I still can't believe this.

39:42.666 --> 39:44.607
Is it, is it okay if I...

39:44.607 --> 39:46.582
Suit yourself.

39:49.942 --> 39:54.889
Charlie, we already have your DNA
from the semen in Ian's car.

39:54.889 --> 39:59.457
- So come on.
- Okay. There are tickets.

39:59.457 --> 40:01.592
But I didn't kill him.

40:01.776 --> 40:03.428
But you were lovers.

40:05.740 --> 40:07.962
Come on, come on, come on.
We ain't got time, Charlie.

40:07.962 --> 40:10.785
- All right, yeah, we were lovers.
- For how long?

40:10.785 --> 40:11.829
Three years.

40:11.829 --> 40:14.441
So you were running away
together that night.

40:14.441 --> 40:15.977
Eloping.

40:15.977 --> 40:17.505
We were.

40:17.505 --> 40:18.525
No.

40:19.889 --> 40:21.373
No.

40:21.980 --> 40:24.211
You okay, Brendan?

40:26.571 --> 40:29.130
Is, is there a bathroom I can use?

40:29.130 --> 40:31.389
Yeah, just out and to the right.

40:39.941 --> 40:41.232
Hey, hey!

40:41.232 --> 40:42.750
You son of a bitch!

40:42.750 --> 40:44.789
He didn't love you.
He loved me!

40:44.789 --> 40:46.755
Get him out of here!
Get him out!

40:46.755 --> 40:47.880
Get him out of here!

40:47.880 --> 40:49.714
Running away? Three years?

40:49.714 --> 40:50.771
That's a lie!

40:50.771 --> 40:55.304
Ian had to stay with Claudia
'cause the stupid bitch got pregnant!

40:55.694 --> 40:57.588
- He made that up to get rid of you!
- What?

40:57.588 --> 40:59.211
Yeah, he said you were
so needy and weak,

40:59.211 --> 41:00.927
it was the only way
he could shake you.

41:00.927 --> 41:03.533
No. It was me, not you.

41:03.533 --> 41:04.836
I saw him last.

41:04.836 --> 41:06.525
I was the one he loved, me!

41:06.525 --> 41:08.551
- Let him go. I'll take care of this.
- No, no, no.

41:08.551 --> 41:10.900
I made him mine! 22 times!

41:10.900 --> 41:12.831
Forever! Mine!

41:12.831 --> 41:14.339
Get him in a holding cell.

41:14.339 --> 41:16.166
Read him his rights.

41:16.557 --> 41:17.720
Let go of me!

41:18.108 --> 41:19.784
Get off of me!

41:20.713 --> 41:22.367
He's mine!

41:25.632 --> 41:27.433
Nice work.

41:27.646 --> 41:29.654
You're free to go.

41:29.928 --> 41:32.887
Hey, no hard feelings.

41:32.887 --> 41:34.388
Yeah.

41:34.867 --> 41:37.048
Claudia...

41:37.456 --> 41:39.256
I'm sorry.

41:39.256 --> 41:41.452
I didn't know.

41:43.825 --> 41:47.096
We'll still need you both
to testify in court.

41:47.096 --> 41:51.697
And I'm afraid we won't be able
to keep this out of the papers.

41:51.697 --> 41:54.777
I want our child to grow up
knowing the truth.

41:55.440 --> 41:58.203
His father was a hero.
