WEBVTT

00:01.533 --> 00:03.091
- I'm in.
- I call.

00:03.253 --> 00:05.892
- Me too. What you got, man?
- Oh, it's so pretty.

00:06.053 --> 00:09.887
It's just so pretty. If I had
two sets of lips, I'd kiss myself.

00:10.653 --> 00:12.211
Trump aces.

00:18.053 --> 00:21.807
Well, it's 9:30. Time to turn in.
The Peacock's catering a big party...

00:21.973 --> 00:24.328
...tomorrow night
after Michelle Michaels' concert.

00:24.493 --> 00:28.168
I suggest you get some shuteye, mister.
We'll be melon balling at 0600.

00:30.293 --> 00:33.330
I can't believe you'll be hanging out
with Michelle Michaels.

00:33.493 --> 00:34.721
She is a goddess.

00:34.893 --> 00:39.091
Please, she put her bra on one cup
at a time just like everybody else.

00:41.293 --> 00:43.011
I'd pay big money to see that.

00:43.173 --> 00:44.925
Save your dough for Friday night.

00:45.093 --> 00:46.924
What's Friday night?

00:47.093 --> 00:50.290
There's people coming. We're gonna
watch the fight on Pay Per View.

00:50.453 --> 00:53.331
Look, Will, I have better things
to do with my Friday nights...

00:53.493 --> 00:57.168
...than sit around, watching
some stupid boxing match on TV.

00:57.533 --> 01:00.605
Well, you overlooked
one small fact, Carlton.

01:00.773 --> 01:03.048
- What's that?
- You weren't invited.

01:05.000 --> 01:11.074

02:12.293 --> 02:14.204
Whoa, now, hold it.

02:14.413 --> 02:17.291
Now, don't think of this just
as a backstage pass.

02:17.493 --> 02:20.724
Think of it more as a merit badge.
What are you going to do to earn it?

02:20.893 --> 02:23.691
You got to do something.
You know what I'm saying?

02:23.893 --> 02:25.246
What's up? What you gonna do?

02:25.413 --> 02:28.211
Will, we have a crisis situation.

02:28.373 --> 02:30.204
The glasses have spots on them.

02:30.373 --> 02:33.445
Oh, my God.
Why didn't you come to me sooner?

02:34.893 --> 02:36.770
Hey.

02:38.453 --> 02:41.843
Relax, squeeky.
It's just a dumb old party.

02:42.013 --> 02:43.924
You don't look at the big picture,
do you?

02:44.093 --> 02:47.722
Today, Michelle Michaels,
tomorrow, Gloria Estefan.

02:47.893 --> 02:52.330
And then, dare I dream,
Michael Bolton.

02:58.333 --> 03:00.801
Lan, I didn't feel like
anything was clicking tonight.

03:00.973 --> 03:02.645
You sure the new songs are working?

03:02.893 --> 03:06.772
Three words, babe, fabulous.
Am I right?

03:09.933 --> 03:12.003
Look at that. Everybody jumping.

03:12.173 --> 03:14.846
People act so stupid
when celebrities get around.

03:15.133 --> 03:16.805
I need a reality check.

03:16.973 --> 03:18.201
You, waiter.

03:19.373 --> 03:22.126
- Come here.
- Me?

03:22.773 --> 03:24.604
Yeah, you.

03:26.173 --> 03:28.050
Miss Michaels wants to see me.

03:34.333 --> 03:37.689
- Have you heard my new record?
- Oh, well, sure, baby, who hasn't?

03:38.053 --> 03:39.771
- It's magic, isn't it?
- Right, sister.

03:39.933 --> 03:41.571
Please.

03:41.733 --> 03:43.451
Do you like it?

03:43.973 --> 03:47.170
Well, you got some beats.
You do got some beats.

03:47.333 --> 03:50.166
And you mix some lyrics with your
beats, and you blended them.

03:50.373 --> 03:53.445
- Be honest.
- I think it stinks.

03:53.653 --> 03:56.963
I apologize, Miss Michaels.
He's from a foreign land.

03:57.133 --> 03:59.601
Back to work, Vladimir.

04:00.893 --> 04:02.292
Carlton Banks here.

04:02.453 --> 04:04.967
I balled your melons.

04:05.573 --> 04:07.484
Get out of here.

04:08.693 --> 04:10.251
So...

04:10.493 --> 04:12.723
...is there anything
you do like about my record?

04:12.893 --> 04:15.248
Oh, yeah.
That cover is slamming, you know.

04:15.413 --> 04:18.485
How long it take you to get all
that honey off you, girl, you know?

04:18.653 --> 04:20.689
You look all sticky and everything,
you know.

04:21.053 --> 04:23.362
I'm sorry.
I'm just acting stupid, you know.

04:23.533 --> 04:24.807
- Yeah.
- I'm just tripping.

04:24.973 --> 04:28.124
I can't believe that I'm actually
talking to Michelle Michaels.

04:28.293 --> 04:30.761
And I can't believe
I'm actually talking to...

04:30.973 --> 04:32.565
Who are you?

04:33.053 --> 04:36.011
Will Smith,
of the Philadelphia Smiths.

04:36.173 --> 04:38.733
So, honest Will.
Did you like the show?

04:39.093 --> 04:41.971
I've been back here. I couldn't
hear anything. All I heard was:

04:46.853 --> 04:49.970
I really didn't have it going on,
but next time I'm gonna kick it...

04:50.173 --> 04:52.164
...and maybe you could be there.

04:53.213 --> 04:55.966
- Yeah, I'm with that. That's a good idea.
- Yeah.

05:00.533 --> 05:02.603
I need to get back to work.

05:03.293 --> 05:04.328
- See you later?
- Yeah.

05:04.493 --> 05:05.767
All right.

05:07.773 --> 05:12.369
You know, Miss Michaels,
I thought your album stunk too.

05:15.573 --> 05:17.689
She only wanted to know my opinion.

05:17.973 --> 05:21.602
Will, I cannot believe Michelle Michaels
actually spoke to you.

05:21.813 --> 05:23.849
Hey, I checked her coat.

05:26.173 --> 05:27.811
Really?

05:27.973 --> 05:31.283
I wonder who'll play
you in the movie of her life?

05:32.853 --> 05:34.286
You know what, Will?

05:34.453 --> 05:37.923
Maybe I'll get you Michelle Michaels'
new CD for your birthday.

05:38.613 --> 05:43.528
Oh, my goodness, that's right.
I do have a birthday coming up.

05:43.693 --> 05:45.809
You know,
it just totally slipped my mind.

05:45.973 --> 05:47.201
Now, now, listen.

05:47.373 --> 05:51.651
Nothing too fancy. Something
in a hatchback will do just fine.

05:53.013 --> 05:56.972
You're impossible to surprise, so this
year, we're not doing anything special.

05:57.173 --> 06:01.928
Okay, we're all set. Birthday reservations
at Wolfgang Puck's new restaurant.

06:06.493 --> 06:07.812
Hilary.

06:08.013 --> 06:09.366
Oh, that's all right.

06:09.533 --> 06:12.286
Don't worry about it.
Aunt Viv, you can still surprise me...

06:12.453 --> 06:15.445
...with that red sweater
you hiding in the upstairs closet.

06:16.653 --> 06:18.689
Wolfgang Puck, huh?

06:19.693 --> 06:21.570
You were great. He fell for it.

06:21.733 --> 06:24.566
Now he'll never suspect
we're giving him a surprise party.

06:24.733 --> 06:27.167
We're giving him a surprise party?

06:29.213 --> 06:34.241
I am proud to announce
Miss Michelle Michaels.

06:34.933 --> 06:37.163
Are you stalking me?

06:37.973 --> 06:39.964
No, I just wanted to see you again.

06:40.133 --> 06:43.091
It was so nice to talk to somebody
other than a hysterical fan.

06:43.253 --> 06:45.813
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God, Michelle Michaels!

06:45.973 --> 06:48.441
Your second song on your third album
is so cool.

06:48.613 --> 06:50.205
Who was Omar?
Is he your boyfriend?

06:50.373 --> 06:53.445
- He is so fine. You might never...
- Ashley, please.

06:53.893 --> 06:56.965
Hilary Banks, TV weathergirl.

06:57.173 --> 07:00.643
Pardon my little sister. She doesn't
know how to talk to celebrities.

07:01.293 --> 07:03.761
So, Mich.

07:06.373 --> 07:07.806
How about a song?

07:09.733 --> 07:12.805
Oh, hello there. I'm Philip Banks.
This is my wife, Vivian.

07:13.013 --> 07:15.004
We're not hip,
so we don't know your music.

07:16.653 --> 07:18.883
It's nice to meet you anyway, though.

07:19.053 --> 07:21.362
- Now, let's give them some privacy.
- Yes, come on.

07:21.533 --> 07:23.922
- Come upstairs.
- It was nice meeting you, Michelle.

07:24.133 --> 07:26.693
It's good to see you again, Michelle.

07:31.133 --> 07:32.327
- Miss Michaels?
- Yes?

07:32.533 --> 07:38.324
Don't think of me as just a manservant,
think of me as a pleasure dome.

07:40.213 --> 07:41.202
Thank you.

07:41.413 --> 07:43.529
Thank you, G.
Thank you very much.

07:46.733 --> 07:50.408
- Well, that was embarrassing.
- No, they're sweet.

07:50.573 --> 07:52.723
So do you wanna come
to my concert tonight?

07:52.933 --> 07:54.651
You can watch from backstage.

07:54.853 --> 07:56.081
Oh, goodness.

07:56.253 --> 07:59.404
See, tonight is dime-a-frame
bowling night, you know.

07:59.613 --> 08:03.925
Top scorer gets those cute little shoes
and I just couldn't miss that.

08:04.133 --> 08:06.727
I'll send a limo for you at 6.

08:15.333 --> 08:19.167
Then, after the concert, she took me to
this fly restaurant called Chez Pinette.

08:19.373 --> 08:22.490
Chez Pinette?
Isn't that up near San Francisco?

08:22.693 --> 08:25.287
Oh, did I forget to tell you-all?

08:25.453 --> 08:27.603
She flew me up there
in her private jet.

08:27.813 --> 08:30.964
- What?
- Michelle has a private jet?

08:31.173 --> 08:33.323
Listen, she got a private jet.
She has yacht.

08:33.493 --> 08:35.563
Does she have a brother?

08:37.693 --> 08:41.129
Well, I don't know.
I'll find out tonight.

08:41.293 --> 08:44.330
We're going to
the Golden Choice Music Awards.

08:44.493 --> 08:48.372
They got us sitting between lke and Tina
just in case something flare up.

08:49.253 --> 08:51.244
Hey, y'all, don't wait up.

08:53.413 --> 08:55.369
Hilary, is the coast clear?

08:55.573 --> 08:59.202
No, there's gonna be patchy
morning fog with limited visibility.

09:07.893 --> 09:09.406
I meant...

09:09.573 --> 09:10.892
...is Will gone?

09:11.093 --> 09:14.369
- Yeah, he's gone.
- Let's talk about this party.

09:14.533 --> 09:18.572
Okay, Hilary, you are getting the DJ
and I arranged for the caterer.

09:18.733 --> 09:21.167
Why do I have to pay for a caterer
if I have a butler?

09:21.573 --> 09:24.690
Philip complains.
That only leaves the cake.

09:24.893 --> 09:27.487
All set. I ordered
a Sunny the Seal ice-cream cake.

09:27.653 --> 09:30.167
His sleek little body is made
of chocolatey goodness...

09:30.333 --> 09:34.292
...and he balances a ball of tutti-frutti
sherbet on his buttercream nose.

09:35.173 --> 09:38.131
You are way too into this.

09:39.013 --> 09:43.689
I guess at your age, birthdays
are no longer a cause for celebration.

09:46.373 --> 09:48.523
I'm giving up a hair appointment
with Sergai...

09:48.693 --> 09:50.888
...to hang out with Will
and his loser friends.

09:51.533 --> 09:53.410
Will's friends are not losers.

09:53.613 --> 09:55.444
Greetings, y'all.

09:57.853 --> 09:59.969
Jazz, to what do we owe
your presence?

10:00.133 --> 10:02.886
My guess would be inbreeding.

10:06.053 --> 10:08.487
I'm taking care of the entertainment
for Will's party.

10:08.653 --> 10:10.291
I've already shelled out for a DJ.

10:10.493 --> 10:13.405
Perfect. Now we have music
for my stripper.

10:13.613 --> 10:17.242
Oh, no, You are not bringing
a naked woman into my house.

10:17.453 --> 10:19.330
Oh, no.
You don't understand, Mrs. Banks.

10:19.493 --> 10:21.609
She don't come in naked.

10:32.613 --> 10:36.049
Where is Will?
He was supposed to be here at 7.

10:36.253 --> 10:38.813
- That's it. I'm leaving.
- Where are you going?

10:38.973 --> 10:41.089
Sergai keeps the salon open till 9.

10:41.253 --> 10:43.721
I'm gonna see
if he can squeeze my head in.

10:46.733 --> 10:49.611
Mr. Banks, can I borrow 50 more bucks
for Princess Lalet?

10:49.773 --> 10:51.092
Otherwise, she gonna leave.

10:51.373 --> 10:53.682
Let her go. I've spent
enough money on this party.

10:57.093 --> 10:59.971
Here's 100 dollars.
No telling when Will will come back.

11:01.013 --> 11:03.652
Well, he didn't leave a message
on the answering machine.

11:03.933 --> 11:05.764
Maybe that's him now.

11:07.613 --> 11:09.126
Will.

11:09.413 --> 11:11.643
You're an hour and a half late.

11:12.133 --> 11:14.442
What, do you mean
you can't make it?

11:15.053 --> 11:17.647
Friends? What friends?

11:41.573 --> 11:43.768
So, birthday boy, you having fun?

11:43.933 --> 11:48.006
This is the best birthday I ever had.
I always wanted to try skiing too.

11:48.173 --> 11:51.210
- You did great.
- Well, yeah. Except for that one run.

11:51.373 --> 11:54.968
I'm just glad that the Saint Bernard
didn't have to suffer.

11:56.333 --> 11:59.166
Oh, I've been wanting
to check this out over here.

11:59.333 --> 12:02.530
- Hey, what does this button do?
- No, Will.

12:04.693 --> 12:07.412
- It's the moon roof.
- Oh, and that's funny?

12:07.573 --> 12:09.529
You think that...? Okay, no, no.

12:09.693 --> 12:12.571
No, what are you doing?
Don't. Come down.

12:12.733 --> 12:14.849
Come inside, it's freezing out there.

12:15.013 --> 12:17.846
- Come up, babe, it's great.
- There's no way. You're crazy.

12:18.013 --> 12:20.129
I said, come up here.
You ain't with me?

12:20.293 --> 12:22.045
- No.
- Well, take that, then, girl.

12:22.213 --> 12:25.364
- How's that?
- All right, that's it.

12:25.533 --> 12:27.410
Oh, what you gonna do?

12:33.813 --> 12:35.292
Oh, man.

12:35.453 --> 12:37.364
Oh, man.

12:37.573 --> 12:39.928
I'm frozen solid.

12:40.093 --> 12:41.446
Really?

12:42.013 --> 12:43.366
Well...

12:43.573 --> 12:45.131
I was thinking...

12:45.853 --> 12:48.606
...maybe I could warm you up
a little bit.

12:49.253 --> 12:50.891
Wait a minute.

12:51.093 --> 12:54.165
I'm sorry. You know, I just got
caught up in the moment.

13:02.373 --> 13:04.329
Oh, hell, yeah.

13:41.053 --> 13:43.442
Greetings from Aspen.

13:45.173 --> 13:47.812
Let me tell you, what a night.

13:47.973 --> 13:49.565
You open up the hot tub...

13:49.733 --> 13:52.293
...and the neighbors come out.
You know what I'm saying?

13:52.453 --> 13:55.172
I didn't even mind Bruce and Demi,
you know.

13:55.333 --> 13:57.972
I really didn't mind Arnold and Maria.

13:58.133 --> 14:02.172
But Frank and Kathy Lee came over
with that little dude Cody.

14:02.333 --> 14:04.847
He made bubbles in the Jacuzzi
without the jets on.

14:05.013 --> 14:06.605
You know what I'm saying?

14:06.853 --> 14:09.083
Nasty little dude, you know.

14:09.253 --> 14:11.562
You have got a lot of nerve, Will.

14:11.733 --> 14:13.769
Right, big guy?

14:14.213 --> 14:15.407
Oh, yeah, right, right.

14:15.613 --> 14:18.764
Will, this Maria Shriver...

14:18.933 --> 14:21.493
...full-figured gal?
- Philip?

14:22.493 --> 14:24.006
Will...

14:24.493 --> 14:27.053
We were throwing you
a big surprise party.

14:27.253 --> 14:28.845
Oh, you were? I'm sorry.

14:29.013 --> 14:31.402
I thought we was just
gonna have dinner.

14:31.613 --> 14:33.888
A cleverly orchestrated ruse, bub.

14:34.053 --> 14:36.772
And to think, I laid out 50 big ones
on your damn cake.

14:36.933 --> 14:38.161
And not just any cake.

14:38.373 --> 14:40.648
I got you that really neat one
in the commercials.

14:40.813 --> 14:42.007
The one that goes:

14:48.333 --> 14:50.130
Carlton.

14:51.853 --> 14:53.081
All right, okay.

14:54.613 --> 14:57.571
Look, I said I'm sorry, all right?

14:57.733 --> 14:59.963
Well, look, I know somebody
that wants to hear...

15:00.133 --> 15:03.364
...about my snowball fight
with Denzel.

15:03.533 --> 15:05.444
- Yo, Hil!
- Will, no!

15:05.973 --> 15:08.441
- Yo, Hil!
- Will, no, no! Don't go up there!

15:08.613 --> 15:10.444
- Will.
- Ashley, what is wrong with you?

15:10.613 --> 15:14.367
Will, I don't think Hilary
wants to see you right now.

15:14.533 --> 15:15.852
Why, what did I do to her?

15:16.053 --> 15:18.123
You made her miss
her appointment with Sergai.

15:18.293 --> 15:20.045
She had to settle for his assistant.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.891
So what?

15:27.973 --> 15:29.770
Damn.

15:31.253 --> 15:32.845
And I mean that...

15:33.013 --> 15:37.325
...in the nicest possible way, Hil.

15:39.133 --> 15:42.205
I look like a troll doll.

15:42.413 --> 15:45.450
Hilary, don't you think
you're overreacting just a tad?

15:45.653 --> 15:48.406
Sleep with one eye open.

15:52.333 --> 15:53.527
Look, come on, guys.

15:53.733 --> 15:56.452
Cut me some slack here.
Now, Uncle Phil.

15:56.653 --> 15:59.565
Now, if you had a choice
between an ordinary...

15:59.853 --> 16:04.369
...yet very thoughtful birthday party,
and hitting the slopes with a superstar...

16:04.533 --> 16:05.932
...which one would you choose?

16:06.133 --> 16:08.124
You mean,
which superstar would I choose?

16:08.293 --> 16:10.602
- Well, if I had to...
- Philip.

16:11.693 --> 16:12.921
Will.

16:13.093 --> 16:17.006
Michelle Michaels may not feel
as serious about all this as you do.

16:17.653 --> 16:19.928
Does that look like
she's playing, Aunt Viv?

16:20.093 --> 16:21.606
She gave it to me in Aspen.

16:22.253 --> 16:23.572
Where are you going?

16:23.733 --> 16:25.689
She's taking me
to see the fight in Vegas.

16:25.853 --> 16:28.287
What about the fight party
you excluded me from?

16:28.453 --> 16:31.729
You got the guys coming over
to watch it on TV.

16:32.053 --> 16:34.123
You know, I'm glad you
reminded me, Carlton.

16:34.293 --> 16:36.932
Listen, make sure
they don't let you in, okay?

16:49.133 --> 16:51.693
<i>And there's the end of round one.</i>

16:58.533 --> 17:01.252
This is better than watching
the fights with my Uncle Phil.

17:01.413 --> 17:03.051
I'm glad you're enjoying yourself.

17:03.293 --> 17:05.727
Hey, now, how could I
not be enjoying myself?

17:05.893 --> 17:08.167
I got Vegas, you, me...

17:08.333 --> 17:11.086
...a black dude and a white dude
beating each other.

17:11.292 --> 17:13.443
Life is good.

17:15.093 --> 17:17.128
Here, let me grab us
a little something here.

17:17.292 --> 17:18.726
Michelle, I got to tell you...

17:18.893 --> 17:21.327
...ever since the barbecue
at Wesley Snipes' crib...

17:21.492 --> 17:23.768
...I kind of been wanting
to say something to you.

17:23.933 --> 17:25.888
I haven't found a way
to say it quite yet.

17:26.053 --> 17:30.046
But this thing we got going on, I just
feel real good about it, you know.

17:30.253 --> 17:33.165
And I just... Hey, hey, hey!

17:35.293 --> 17:36.646
Hello, who is this?!

17:36.813 --> 17:40.123
Rick Benton.
We shot a swimsuit video in Tahiti.

17:40.293 --> 17:42.887
- This is Will Smith.
- Guy?

17:44.333 --> 17:45.652
Michelle, Michelle.

17:45.813 --> 17:48.771
You know, you're even more alluring
with your clothes on.

17:50.213 --> 17:53.603
Isn't he the funniest male model
you ever met?

17:56.133 --> 17:57.361
Oh, wait a minute.

17:57.533 --> 17:59.330
Now I recognize this dude.

17:59.733 --> 18:01.689
I take it you've seen
my calendar, huh?

18:01.893 --> 18:04.361
Yeah, you were the April fool, right?

18:08.253 --> 18:10.483
Look, guy, listen.

18:10.893 --> 18:13.691
Michelle is a one-man woman now,
all right?

18:13.853 --> 18:15.206
- Oh, really?
- Yes, sir.

18:15.373 --> 18:17.841
You might be able to tell
by this ring she gave me.

18:18.013 --> 18:20.573
It kind of reminds me
of this one right here.

18:20.773 --> 18:22.729
So are we all friends now?

18:23.133 --> 18:26.967
Oh, yeah. We found out
we had a lot in common.

18:28.053 --> 18:31.090
Look, black Fabio, listen.

18:33.573 --> 18:36.929
Why don't you
and your Motown-revival haircut...

18:37.133 --> 18:39.044
...go back to your seat...

18:39.733 --> 18:43.248
...shave your chest,
shut up and just watch the fight.

18:43.453 --> 18:44.886
- Will.
- What?

18:45.053 --> 18:47.169
<i>- Round 2.
- Are you squaring off on me, fool?</i>

18:47.333 --> 18:49.449
What you gonna do?
What you gonna do?

18:57.493 --> 19:01.122
Poor Rick. He'll be
in the hospital for weeks now.

19:01.333 --> 19:04.166
How did I know
he was gonna fall on Sinatra?

19:05.213 --> 19:07.044
I think you overreacted.

19:07.253 --> 19:11.371
What am I supposed to do with a dude
putting his hands all over my woman?

19:11.573 --> 19:13.370
Look, besides, he deserved it.

19:13.573 --> 19:15.086
He stole one of your rings.

19:15.293 --> 19:17.090
- Will, I gave him that ring.
- You did?

19:17.253 --> 19:19.164
Yeah, I did. I give out a lot of rings.

19:19.373 --> 19:23.286
Well, I'm saying, this one you gave me
is the last one though, right?

19:23.813 --> 19:26.373
I just gave one to the paramedic.

19:27.973 --> 19:30.692
I was wondering
why he was taking your pulse.

19:32.253 --> 19:33.652
Will.

19:36.053 --> 19:38.203
You're so adorable.

19:38.453 --> 19:41.172
But I think we need
to take some time off.

19:42.253 --> 19:45.006
You're right. I'm gonna play slots.
I'll be back in an hour.

19:45.173 --> 19:46.447
Will.

19:46.973 --> 19:48.406
Sit.

19:51.533 --> 19:53.364
It's been fun.

19:53.653 --> 19:55.609
Excuse me, "been"?

19:56.613 --> 20:00.322
I'm no good with relationships. I thought
you knew. Don't you listen to my songs?

20:00.653 --> 20:02.132
Well, yeah, I do.

20:02.293 --> 20:03.646
Okay... Why...? All right.

20:03.813 --> 20:07.203
There's "Untouchable."
There's "Never Going To Settle."

20:07.373 --> 20:10.570
There's "Wham Bam Goodbye."

20:17.893 --> 20:20.487
Come on.
This isn't goodbye.

20:20.653 --> 20:23.372
You only say goodbye to people
you're never gonna see again.

20:23.533 --> 20:24.852
This is more like...

20:25.093 --> 20:26.970
...see you later.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.132
I'll see you later, Will.

20:48.773 --> 20:51.048
Goodbye, Michelle.

21:06.733 --> 21:10.169
- Hey, good morning, Uncle Phil.
- It was a hell of a fight last night, Will.

21:10.373 --> 21:11.965
Yeah, champ ain't no joke, right?

21:12.173 --> 21:14.129
I was referring to your bout.

21:14.653 --> 21:16.769
They showed that on TV?

21:16.933 --> 21:20.005
From the first shove to when Sinatra
put his toupee back on.

21:21.293 --> 21:22.772
There ain't gonna be no rematch.

21:22.933 --> 21:25.322
When dude get out of the hospital,
he can have her.

21:25.653 --> 21:26.927
She dumped you, right?

21:27.333 --> 21:29.927
Man, you crazy? Yeah.

21:32.053 --> 21:35.045
Well, it was a nice ride
while it lasted, huh?

21:35.773 --> 21:37.968
You know what, Uncle Phil?

21:38.573 --> 21:40.962
I think I loved her.

21:42.533 --> 21:44.091
Bull.

21:44.453 --> 21:46.683
You hardly even knew her.

21:46.973 --> 21:49.646
No, no. Uncle Phil, I knew her.
You know what I'm saying?

21:49.813 --> 21:51.769
I knew her.

21:52.653 --> 21:54.928
You might have known her intimately.

21:55.093 --> 21:56.731
But you didn't know her well.

21:56.893 --> 22:00.568
Come on, face it, Will.
It was the lifestyle you're in love with.

22:01.373 --> 22:02.601
Time out.

22:02.773 --> 22:06.083
You trying to say
that the only reason I loved her...

22:06.293 --> 22:08.932
...was because she was rich
and let me sponge off of her?

22:10.893 --> 22:12.485
Then I love you too, Uncle Phil.

22:18.573 --> 22:20.165
I don't believe you guys did this.

22:20.373 --> 22:23.092
We waited an hour and a half.
What's a couple more days?

22:23.733 --> 22:27.009
- We even saved Sunny the Seal for you.
- Really, where?
