00:15.765 --> 00:18.351
<i>Ask any Russian,</i>
<i>"Do you like dressed herring?"</i>

00:18.435 --> 00:22.564
<i>and they will say, "Yes! Yes!</i>
<i>I love dressed herring so much!"</i>

00:24.357 --> 00:27.027
<i>Even I am under the spell</i>
<i>of that crap.</i>

00:28.111 --> 00:30.030
<i>When I see dressed herring,</i>

00:30.113 --> 00:33.366
<i>I understand that it is, God damn it,</i>
<i>a complete piece of shit.</i>

00:34.076 --> 00:35.493
<i>But I take it and eat it.</i>

00:42.709 --> 00:46.838
<i>That taste, it's in our heads.</i>

00:51.176 --> 00:54.429
<i>Russians suffered 75 years,</i>
<i>two and a half generations of Soviet time,</i>

00:54.512 --> 01:01.103
<i>when people were fooled</i>
<i>into eating this gray urban grub.</i>

01:04.647 --> 01:07.317
<i>And our mentality</i>
<i>has remained the same ever since.</i>

01:11.654 --> 01:15.200
<i>I really hate that period</i>
<i>because it destroyed all Russian cuisine.</i>

01:16.909 --> 01:19.036
<i>And I will do whatever it takes</i>

01:19.121 --> 01:21.956
to bring the genuine Russian taste
back to the people.

02:34.737 --> 02:36.281
<i>Move it to my side.</i>

02:51.003 --> 02:53.923
<i>Most people abroad</i>

02:54.006 --> 02:57.927
<i>think Russia is some kind of</i>
<i>completely wild kingdom...</i>

03:00.555 --> 03:03.891
<i>somewhere in the woods where you can</i>
<i>see bears walking down the streets.</i>

03:07.354 --> 03:14.236
<i>Even the most educated restaurant critics</i>
<i>ask me some really bizarre questions.</i>

03:14.319 --> 03:18.281
"Do you all really drink vodka there
year round, Andrey?"

03:18.365 --> 03:19.741
It's pretty bizarre.

03:23.286 --> 03:26.289
<i>The idea of Russian cuisine</i>
<i>is almost the same.</i>

03:27.999 --> 03:31.794
<i>The majority of foreigners</i>
<i>see Russian cuisine</i>

03:31.878 --> 03:33.921
<i>as very simple and almost crass.</i>

03:37.675 --> 03:40.220
<i>But it's not only about vodka</i>
<i>and snacks that go with it</i>

03:40.303 --> 03:41.304
<i>as people may think.</i>

03:43.765 --> 03:45.850
<i>There's an interesting cuisine.</i>

05:02.677 --> 05:09.058
Russians are often offended that, abroad,
we are associated with the words...

05:09.141 --> 05:13.313
..."pies," "pancakes,"
"caviar," "borscht."

05:18.776 --> 05:21.153
<i>Vladimir does a very important thing.</i>

05:22.113 --> 05:26.242
<i>He rediscovers the old cuisine,</i>
<i>the old recipes...</i>

05:28.911 --> 05:33.290
<i>but he filters them in his personal style</i>
<i>to such an extent</i>

05:33.375 --> 05:36.002
<i>that it becomes interesting</i>
<i>for the contemporary public.</i>

05:37.336 --> 05:40.923
<i>He shows that there is diversity</i>
<i>to our cuisine.</i>

06:14.874 --> 06:17.710
<i>I have known Vladimir for a long time.</i>

06:17.794 --> 06:21.047
He is always in the pursuit
of something more.

06:24.842 --> 06:29.556
And he doesn't really hide his ambitions
to become the best chef in the world.

06:32.684 --> 06:36.312
<i>He was the first one</i>
<i>who broke into the international arena...</i>

06:37.522 --> 06:39.649
<i>and showed everyone</i>
<i>what Russians are capable of.</i>

06:41.192 --> 06:44.320
There's more than ballet and rockets.

06:46.155 --> 06:47.990
<i>There's the new Russian cuisine.</i>

06:56.165 --> 06:58.710
<i>Let's cook Maundy Thursday's salt, okay?</i>

07:04.256 --> 07:06.383
Okay, we mix salt with rye flour.

07:09.178 --> 07:10.638
Venya, do you know about this?

07:12.474 --> 07:13.558
You don't?

07:13.641 --> 07:15.226
Do you know what Maundy Thursday is?

07:16.143 --> 07:19.105
Maundy Thursday is a day when people
are washing and cleaning everything, man.

07:19.188 --> 07:20.231
This is Maundy Thursday.

07:20.314 --> 07:22.399
It occurs during Lent,
right before Easter.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.736
This is a unique history.

07:24.819 --> 07:27.530
Especially for this day,
people made this salt.

07:28.155 --> 07:31.367
And this salt was used
to salt the Easter eggs.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.161
Got it?

07:39.250 --> 07:41.711
<i>In our country, people say</i>
<i>we do not have Russian cuisine.</i>

07:43.838 --> 07:46.173
<i>What is Russian cuisine?</i>
<i>It's nothing.</i>

07:49.469 --> 07:51.513
<i>They say this.</i>
<i>And they are cooks!</i>

07:53.515 --> 07:55.683
These are my colleagues
who are doing this.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.020
And I want to destroy them for this.

08:05.026 --> 08:10.865
<i>Russian chefs, we started to copy</i>
<i>cuisines from all over the world.</i>

08:14.619 --> 08:16.954
<i>I really don't understand</i>
<i>how we got to this point.</i>

08:19.999 --> 08:24.546
<i>How could you be so spineless,</i>
<i>trying to fit in with the rest?</i>

08:27.173 --> 08:29.551
<i>I want to do things differently,</i>

08:29.634 --> 08:31.427
to tear this all to pieces.

08:32.428 --> 08:34.180
Maybe another flour?

08:34.263 --> 08:35.890
-White?
-Maybe.

08:35.973 --> 08:39.018
I think maybe we should smoke it.

08:44.148 --> 08:47.401
<i>In our country,</i>
<i>we should be proud of what we had.</i>

08:52.740 --> 08:57.912
<i>My task is to prove to those people</i>
<i>that live in our country</i>

08:58.621 --> 09:04.251
that Russian cuisine existed,
exists and will exist.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.618
Still young, they've just begun.

09:36.701 --> 09:39.495
Yes, they have
only just started gathering.

09:41.831 --> 09:44.834
<i>To understand what honey</i>
<i>means to Russian people,</i>

09:44.917 --> 09:46.878
<i>one needs to go far back in time.</i>

09:49.088 --> 09:54.176
<i>Basically, everyone used to harvest honey,</i>
<i>because there was no sugar at all.</i>

09:54.886 --> 09:56.888
Everything was honey-based.

09:57.722 --> 10:00.516
The aroma is unreal.
The smell is totally crazy.

10:03.060 --> 10:07.356
<i>Sugar came to Russia</i>
<i>sometime in the early 16th century.</i>

10:09.275 --> 10:11.360
<i>Honey slowly got replaced by sugar.</i>

10:13.279 --> 10:15.740
<i>But it's not right.</i>

10:19.160 --> 10:24.456
Because honey embodies
the true Russian taste and tradition.

10:37.511 --> 10:41.348
<i>When I talk about dishes</i>
<i>that define the Russian taste,</i>

10:41.432 --> 10:43.309
I mean honey cake.

10:45.978 --> 10:49.732
<i>When I was little,</i>
<i>my grandmother baked huge honey cakes.</i>

10:53.485 --> 10:57.782
<i>She would leave layers of the cake</i>
<i>on the stairs to cool down.</i>

11:03.037 --> 11:04.538
<i>Naturally, I was impatient.</i>

11:08.500 --> 11:11.087
<i>I would walk to where the cream</i>
<i>was cooling down</i>

11:12.046 --> 11:13.339
and eat it with my finger.

11:16.258 --> 11:18.052
<i>I loved that cream a lot.</i>

11:27.394 --> 11:29.563
<i>I still remember the flavor.</i>

11:31.733 --> 11:34.276
<i>The perfect combination</i>
<i>of sweet and sour...</i>

11:35.569 --> 11:37.654
<i>fried honey and sour cream.</i>

11:40.116 --> 11:41.367
The real Russian taste.

11:47.706 --> 11:50.501
<i>Now, I bake honey cake at my restaurant.</i>

11:55.006 --> 11:57.341
<i>But I make it more modern.</i>

12:02.013 --> 12:05.099
<i>Because many people don't understand</i>
<i>what honey cake is.</i>

12:09.603 --> 12:12.064
<i>They taste it, and they'll realize</i>
<i>it's delicious...</i>

12:17.736 --> 12:19.947
<i>but they won't understand</i>
<i>what it's linked to.</i>

12:23.367 --> 12:26.162
<i>That's why I give my modernized version...</i>

12:27.997 --> 12:30.124
<i>next to my grandma's recipe.</i>

12:33.127 --> 12:38.132
I slowly teach them
to feel the moment of evolution.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.721
My cake can't hold a candle
to hers, damn it.

13:02.865 --> 13:07.870
<i>The end of the 19th century was the peak</i>
<i>of the Russian culinary cuisine.</i>

13:07.954 --> 13:10.539
It was wonderful.
It was diverse.

13:12.458 --> 13:15.878
<i>Everything changed after the revolution.</i>

13:19.757 --> 13:23.761
<i>In the past,</i>
<i>the country was governed by the rich</i>

13:23.844 --> 13:26.055
<i>and by the capitalists.</i>

13:27.932 --> 13:31.936
<i>But now, for the first time, the country</i>
<i>is being governed by the masses.</i>

13:36.190 --> 13:38.943
<i>Revolution, famine, civil war...</i>

13:41.403 --> 13:45.657
<i>We went through a period</i>
<i>of total shortages.</i>

13:52.123 --> 13:55.251
<i>A terrible shortcoming of the period</i>

13:55.334 --> 14:00.256
was the isolation of our cuisine
from the global cuisine.

14:04.426 --> 14:06.262
<i>We were stewing in our own juice,</i>

14:06.345 --> 14:11.267
<i>while the entire culinary world was</i>
<i>developing, evolving and moving forward.</i>

14:14.853 --> 14:17.814
<i>During the Soviet Union,</i>
<i>cooks were very constrained.</i>

14:19.733 --> 14:23.695
<i>Everyone was supposed to do the same thing</i>
<i>to make it easier to run the country.</i>

14:27.074 --> 14:30.119
<i>And everyone cooked</i>
<i>from one book of recipes</i>

14:30.202 --> 14:32.496
called <i>On Tasty and Healthy Food.</i>

14:35.917 --> 14:40.087
<i>They were trying to paint everyone</i>
<i>with the same brush.</i>

14:43.174 --> 14:44.926
<i>There was no creativity at all.</i>

15:14.288 --> 15:15.581
Shall I not salt it at all?

15:15.664 --> 15:18.709
Well, you should add salt and pepper
between the layers.

15:18.792 --> 15:21.003
Yes, just like that.
The peasant style.

15:22.964 --> 15:24.715
I'll take some parsley now.

15:26.633 --> 15:30.972
Remember you told me that in America
there is a stem of parsley?

15:31.055 --> 15:32.181
Yes.

15:32.264 --> 15:35.142
Do you know that I'm using it?
That I make a dessert of it?

15:35.226 --> 15:38.770
Of course.
I am your dad, after all.

15:40.897 --> 15:46.070
<i>When I was young, my dad was one</i>
<i>of the most famous chefs in our town.</i>

15:47.654 --> 15:50.657
He was always busy at work
in the kitchen.

15:53.995 --> 15:55.162
Three eggplants.

15:55.246 --> 15:57.331
-There won't be enough room.
-It will press down.

15:57.414 --> 15:58.749
-Okay.
-It will press down.

16:00.001 --> 16:03.129
<i>I was always fighting</i>
<i>for a possibility to spend time with him.</i>

16:05.589 --> 16:08.342
<i>And when I finally saw</i>
<i>what my dad was doing in the kitchen...</i>

16:09.885 --> 16:14.223
I knew what I would do with my life.

16:20.646 --> 16:24.066
<i>I remember Vladimir saying,</i>
<i>"I want to be a cook.</i>

16:24.984 --> 16:26.610
<i>I want to be a chef.</i>

16:26.693 --> 16:29.446
<i>I want to be like you.</i>
<i>I want to be better than you."</i>

16:33.034 --> 16:35.452
He was 12 at that time.

16:35.536 --> 16:38.164
So he found himself in my kitchen.

16:41.875 --> 16:44.045
<i>I am a very demanding person.</i>

16:44.128 --> 16:46.047
So it was going to be difficult for him.

16:46.672 --> 16:47.673
Cover it with the lid.

16:48.215 --> 16:49.216
And put it on the fire.

16:51.552 --> 16:54.013
<i>Dad gave me</i>
<i>the worst jobs right away.</i>

16:54.096 --> 16:56.723
So I was washing dishes for a while.

17:01.353 --> 17:05.816
While my friends were still asleep,
I went to work.

17:09.778 --> 17:12.489
<i>They used to bring us</i>
<i>three to four cows at a time.</i>

17:13.199 --> 17:14.366
About 1,300 lbs each.

17:18.495 --> 17:21.165
<i>You have to pull a knife along each rib.</i>

17:22.541 --> 17:24.293
<i>It's very hard work.</i>

17:28.630 --> 17:31.842
<i>I remember I almost stabbed myself</i>
<i>in the stomach.</i>

17:34.803 --> 17:36.388
We need lower fire.

17:36.472 --> 17:39.308
-Shall we pour some water?
-Of course.

17:40.517 --> 17:43.770
<i>Dad set a really high bar.</i>

17:45.772 --> 17:49.735
Every mistake was regarded
as a catastrophe, an explosion.

17:58.369 --> 18:00.371
<i>It was very difficult.</i>

18:37.574 --> 18:39.785
Look, so tender.

18:39.868 --> 18:41.745
You can sit on it,
and it will spring right back.

18:44.039 --> 18:45.957
This is a traditional pryanik.

18:46.917 --> 18:49.961
It's a traditional Danilov recipe,
restored.

18:50.045 --> 18:52.047
There is filling in there.

18:53.715 --> 18:54.883
Let's taste it.

18:58.762 --> 19:00.306
-Delicious?
-Unreal!

19:01.640 --> 19:05.977
<i>In Russia, we had some</i>
<i>pretty interesting culinary traditions.</i>

19:06.061 --> 19:07.729
Unfortunately, we have lost them all.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.818
This is really a classic one,
a monastery dessert.

19:14.403 --> 19:18.240
<i>And now, Vladimir is trying to</i>
<i>revive old-school Russian cuisine.</i>

19:19.825 --> 19:22.453
<i>Vladimir and his team</i>
<i>have spent months in the libraries,</i>

19:22.536 --> 19:25.080
<i>discovering old recipes.</i>

19:26.332 --> 19:30.126
And they've discovered
some really interesting things.

19:38.009 --> 19:40.887
<i>There is an old Russian recipe</i>
<i>that I found in an old book.</i>

19:41.722 --> 19:43.640
<i>Moose lips shchi.</i>

19:49.020 --> 19:51.898
<i>When I read about the moose lips</i>
<i>in the book...</i>

19:53.484 --> 19:55.236
I started to fantasize, to visualize them.

19:55.319 --> 20:00.532
Moose lips. I imagined them,
how I'd cook them.

20:05.787 --> 20:09.124
<i>But when they actually</i>
<i>brought the moose head...</i>

20:11.918 --> 20:14.338
I looked into its eyes...

20:15.964 --> 20:17.132
and I was shocked.

20:38.945 --> 20:42.658
This part of the lips is what is edible.
Here, where it is hanging.

20:44.451 --> 20:47.996
<i>I started by cooking in the same style</i>
<i>our ancestors had cooked them.</i>

20:50.374 --> 20:51.833
<i>I was restoring the old recipe</i>

20:52.751 --> 20:54.628
and restoring the old flavor.

21:00.259 --> 21:03.970
<i>I liked the combination,</i>
<i>the texture, the intense flavor.</i>

21:05.180 --> 21:08.725
So I gathered all that
and tried to make it my way.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.944
<i>My task is to preserve</i>
<i>the exact taste from the past,</i>

21:19.027 --> 21:22.323
but visually, on the plate,
make it modern.

21:27.369 --> 21:30.205
<i>So I took the taste of moose lips shchi</i>

21:30.289 --> 21:32.833
<i>and packed it into dumplings.</i>

21:34.876 --> 21:36.462
<i>Remember the story</i>
<i>about the ugly duckling?</i>

21:38.922 --> 21:40.299
<i>Transformation.</i>

21:51.435 --> 21:54.187
<i>That became a trend.</i>

21:56.898 --> 21:59.776
<i>Moose lips are cooked</i>
<i>at many restaurants in Russia now.</i>

22:04.114 --> 22:06.700
<i>It's important for me...</i>

22:08.535 --> 22:13.832
<i>to use as many old authentic recipes</i>
<i>as possible, to transform them...</i>

22:16.001 --> 22:18.587
and turn them into a fashionable dish

22:18.670 --> 22:21.882
that one day will be cooked
all over the world.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.134
<i>The daring 1990s.</i>

23:10.847 --> 23:12.808
<i>That's when everything started changing.</i>

23:15.769 --> 23:17.604
<i>There was an explosion, a breakthrough,</i>

23:17.688 --> 23:20.649
<i>and everything that was outside</i>
<i>and forbidden to us before</i>

23:20.732 --> 23:24.152
<i>immediately became available.</i>

23:34.580 --> 23:39.460
<i>The globalization</i>
<i>touched our whole nation.</i>

23:51.638 --> 23:53.474
<i>I was young,</i>

23:53.557 --> 23:56.643
and I am immediately surrounded
by Snickers, Mars, Twix.

23:56.727 --> 23:59.354
I don't know what... M&M's.

23:59.437 --> 24:01.231
All this came to my life.

24:06.862 --> 24:09.197
<i>It was so unique and so forbidden.</i>

24:12.450 --> 24:15.537
<i>Suddenly, new restaurants</i>
<i>emerged out of nowhere, new products.</i>

24:20.501 --> 24:24.546
<i>It was definitely something new</i>
<i>for a Soviet cook.</i>

24:31.177 --> 24:35.932
Russian gastronomical culture
made a gigantic step forward,

24:36.016 --> 24:37.392
like a rocket took off in Russia.

24:53.825 --> 24:56.286
Choosing a fish, first of all,
you should pay attention to its gills.

24:56.369 --> 25:00.541
Its gills should always be good-looking
and eyes should not be cloudy.

25:02.500 --> 25:04.920
It should always smell like the sea.

25:07.463 --> 25:10.425
Smells like fish, right?

25:12.052 --> 25:14.763
<i>When I was 18 years old,</i>

25:14.846 --> 25:17.641
<i>I was appointed chef</i>
<i>in my dad's restaurant.</i>

25:20.727 --> 25:23.814
<i>I was the youngest cook</i>
<i>in the whole area,</i>

25:23.897 --> 25:26.858
<i>if not in the whole country.</i>

25:29.861 --> 25:35.241
<i>I had everything to create</i>
<i>the cozy life of a family man.</i>

25:37.202 --> 25:42.916
<i>I had a house and a car.</i>
<i>I had a girlfriend whom I was dating...</i>

25:44.209 --> 25:49.673
but I wanted to prove
that I was capable of more.

25:53.844 --> 25:55.971
<i>My father was doing</i>
<i>classic Russian dishes.</i>

25:58.098 --> 26:01.517
That is, it was genuine.
His dishes were filled with Russian taste.

26:04.062 --> 26:06.940
<i>However, I liked what the Europeans</i>
<i>were doing.</i>

26:10.944 --> 26:14.489
<i>Vladimir began to change</i>
<i>traditional dishes, sides and sauces</i>

26:14.572 --> 26:17.993
<i>into something different.</i>

26:22.580 --> 26:25.375
<i>He eventually shifted</i>
<i>towards modern cuisine.</i>

26:32.382 --> 26:34.175
<i>I disagreed with it for a long time...</i>

26:37.137 --> 26:40.015
To the extent that the menu

26:40.098 --> 26:41.892
got split in two.

26:41.975 --> 26:44.811
<i>Customers knew the Soviet classics</i>

26:44.895 --> 26:46.396
<i>were from Mukhin Senior</i>

26:46.479 --> 26:49.733
<i>and the modernized dishes</i>
<i>were from Mukhin Junior.</i>

26:56.782 --> 26:59.450
<i>Eventually, our small town</i>
<i>became too cramped for the both of us.</i>

27:01.161 --> 27:02.954
<i>He started visiting Moscow...</i>

27:04.665 --> 27:05.832
<i>trying to settle there.</i>

27:10.128 --> 27:11.797
<i>Dad and I had a very serious talk.</i>

27:16.968 --> 27:19.721
<i>Dad said, "Here, you've got everything...</i>

27:21.264 --> 27:23.183
<i>and there, you will have nothing.</i>

27:25.518 --> 27:29.147
<i>You'll have to start over.</i>
<i>Go back to the very beginning."</i>

27:31.900 --> 27:34.235
<i>I was thinking a lot</i>
<i>after this conversation.</i>

27:37.572 --> 27:42.869
It was always important for me to do
something outside of Dad's control.

27:56.132 --> 27:57.884
<i>So I decided to go to Moscow.</i>

28:44.389 --> 28:47.017
Guys, attention!
There are plenty of orders ahead.

28:48.559 --> 28:50.603
We haven't seen anything yet.

28:50.686 --> 28:51.772
Speed up!

28:56.777 --> 29:00.030
<i>Back home in Essentuki,</i>
<i>I was the goddamn king of the castle.</i>

29:00.947 --> 29:04.492
I came here,
and they send me to the sink.

29:05.118 --> 29:06.787
Runners!

29:06.870 --> 29:11.249
<i>I was washing dishes, peeling potatoes,</i>
<i>peeling veggies, cleaning mussels.</i>

29:13.251 --> 29:14.669
<i>I started from the bottom.</i>

29:17.380 --> 29:21.467
<i>It was hard for me, but it was my life.</i>

29:31.644 --> 29:35.857
<i>What I learned from the cooks</i>
<i>and the chefs</i>

29:35.941 --> 29:38.443
<i>was insanely interesting for me.</i>

29:40.028 --> 29:45.867
<i>They introduced me to many</i>
<i>European technologies and ways to cook.</i>

29:49.788 --> 29:52.207
<i>Father was very upset.</i>

29:53.583 --> 29:57.796
He didn't talk to me for a long time,
because he didn't understand my decision.

30:01.132 --> 30:04.760
<i>He tried to get me to come home</i>
<i>several times.</i>

30:07.222 --> 30:11.309
<i>He was sending food</i>
<i>cooked by his own hands.</i>

30:14.395 --> 30:16.772
<i>I was eating his food</i>
<i>and thinking of home.</i>

30:25.907 --> 30:29.244
<i>He was showing me</i>
<i>that I was still under his control.</i>

30:39.545 --> 30:44.134
<i>When we stopped communicating,</i>
<i>for me it was a tragedy.</i>

30:48.471 --> 30:52.308
<i>But I loved cheating</i>
<i>on the Russian cuisine.</i>

30:57.480 --> 30:59.357
<i>I had always been under his eye...</i>

31:04.029 --> 31:06.031
<i>and, here, I broke free from that life.</i>

31:09.159 --> 31:11.119
<i>I felt what freedom was like.</i>

31:32.182 --> 31:34.684
Guys, do you know what trutovik is?

31:36.352 --> 31:38.939
Right now, trutovik is a trend
all over Russia.

31:40.231 --> 31:41.774
Okay, let's cook the mushrooms.

31:44.360 --> 31:49.865
<i>When I became a sous-chef,</i>
<i>I spent some time in Avignon, France.</i>

31:51.910 --> 31:54.412
<i>I was working</i>
<i>at Restaurant Christian Etienne.</i>

31:56.622 --> 31:59.875
<i>And one day,</i>
<i>Christian was cooking Russian cuisine.</i>

32:01.294 --> 32:03.671
<i>When I looked at it, I said, "Christian...</i>

32:03.754 --> 32:06.216
<i>with all my respect,</i>
<i>you are a kickass chef,</i>

32:06.299 --> 32:08.343
but what you are cooking
is not Russian cuisine.

32:08.426 --> 32:09.970
It's a pathetic excuse for it.

32:12.722 --> 32:14.890
<i>Do you want me to give you</i>
<i>the real Russian taste?"</i>

32:16.351 --> 32:17.435
He said, "Go ahead!"

32:26.569 --> 32:28.321
<i>And I cooked real Russian dishes.</i>

32:30.781 --> 32:32.951
I clearly remember, he loved the borscht.

32:33.034 --> 32:36.079
I even have photos of him
tasting and saying...

32:39.415 --> 32:42.085
<i>After that, I wrote a menu.</i>

32:46.339 --> 32:49.884
<i>He made a few revisions,</i>
<i>made some things lighter...</i>

32:51.511 --> 32:53.513
<i>changed some sauce and so on.</i>

33:03.356 --> 33:08.194
<i>His French clients who ate it were amazed.</i>

33:08.278 --> 33:10.488
They loved his Russian cooking.

33:17.620 --> 33:22.750
<i>The many taste combinations</i>
<i>my dad taught me...</i>

33:23.334 --> 33:26.379
they really do work.

33:31.676 --> 33:34.054
<i>Then I realized that Russian cuisine</i>

33:34.137 --> 33:36.556
<i>can have its own place</i>
<i>in the modern world.</i>

33:38.641 --> 33:40.893
<i>We do have the potential.</i>

34:01.831 --> 34:06.001
Some people think that it is
impossible to make wine out of honey.

34:07.295 --> 34:08.629
They should drink this.

34:13.301 --> 34:14.427
Terrific.

34:15.428 --> 34:19.057
<i>I was extremely amazed</i>
<i>by that trip to France.</i>

34:20.100 --> 34:22.017
<i>And after that, I could not stop.</i>

34:23.894 --> 34:25.855
I had my family knowledge,

34:25.938 --> 34:30.025
but I wanted to complement it
with knowledge from all over Russia.

34:31.778 --> 34:34.989
This Dousheparka honey ale is only made
in Yaroslavskaya region.

34:37.492 --> 34:42.163
<i>The idea was to build my knowledge</i>
<i>brick by brick.</i>

34:47.877 --> 34:50.671
So I started traveling a lot
and talking to people.

34:56.261 --> 34:58.804
Do you use any spice, laurel?

34:58.888 --> 35:00.890
Laurel at all times.

35:00.973 --> 35:02.433
Sugar?

35:02.517 --> 35:04.560
Absolutely no sugar!

35:05.728 --> 35:08.273
That is not for shchi.

35:10.233 --> 35:13.153
<i>These people opened new doors for me...</i>

35:14.987 --> 35:17.990
<i>and I actually started to recover</i>
<i>all these old recipes.</i>

35:19.534 --> 35:23.288
<i>Russian cuisine was revealing its face.</i>

35:33.631 --> 35:37.051
Do they eat something particular
that makes their milk so special?

35:37.135 --> 35:39.720
Noxious plants are part of their diet.

35:40.346 --> 35:42.265
Are you serious?
They eat noxious plants?

35:42.348 --> 35:44.559
Yes. It's like a delicacy for them.

35:52.567 --> 35:55.236
In three years,
this little fish will give caviar.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.905
Three years? Cool.

36:01.159 --> 36:03.453
<i>While traveling,</i>
<i>I discovered new products,</i>

36:03.536 --> 36:04.954
<i>interesting new produce.</i>

36:12.170 --> 36:14.297
<i>People did everything differently.</i>

36:15.798 --> 36:19.677
Kvasura, Kvasura,
bless our mead.

36:20.845 --> 36:24.014
And if the goat drinks it up,
then it will be good.

36:25.350 --> 36:27.227
<i>Everything was new for me.</i>

36:34.066 --> 36:36.486
For me, it was quite a breakthrough.

36:42.283 --> 36:47.372
<i>Then I happened to meet my partner, Boris,</i>
<i>the owner of White Rabbit.</i>

36:52.418 --> 36:56.256
<i>At that moment, I had this</i>
<i>nuclear suitcase, as they say in Russia.</i>

36:58.383 --> 36:59.842
<i>I went up to the 16th floor, and...</i>

37:01.010 --> 37:02.428
<i>I decided to detonate it here.</i>

37:55.940 --> 37:57.733
<i>When I opened White Rabbit,</i>

37:58.734 --> 38:02.196
<i>at that time,</i>
<i>we had a boom of Italian restaurants.</i>

38:02.988 --> 38:06.742
After that, a boom of Japanese sushi
restaurants rolled across the country.

38:09.078 --> 38:12.081
<i>Our Russian restaurant culture</i>

38:12.164 --> 38:15.084
<i>was centered on the phenomenon</i>
<i>of globalization.</i>

38:17.920 --> 38:21.841
<i>So when we started sharing</i>
<i>Russian food with our customers,</i>

38:22.800 --> 38:24.969
there was a lot of skepticism.

38:37.106 --> 38:39.317
<i>In the beginning,</i>
<i>people didn't understand.</i>

38:41.110 --> 38:43.738
<i>I almost had fights with the guests.</i>

38:55.625 --> 38:58.503
<i>We were buying oysters from the Black Sea,</i>

38:59.920 --> 39:02.089
<i>and we were cooking those</i>
<i>in an unique way.</i>

39:10.180 --> 39:14.894
<i>They would eat them and say,</i>
<i>"I've been to France.</i>

39:14.977 --> 39:17.855
<i>I was eating oysters there</i>
<i>and they had a different taste.</i>

39:18.814 --> 39:20.566
<i>I want oysters like that."</i>

39:23.653 --> 39:26.447
<i>I would say,</i>
<i>"But these are our Russian ingredients.</i>

39:27.573 --> 39:29.909
We should be proud of what we have."

39:41.379 --> 39:44.590
<i>It was a very critical period for me,</i>
<i>and I was desperate.</i>

39:48.761 --> 39:54.141
<i>I wanted to show the Russian guests</i>
<i>exactly what their cuisine is like...</i>

39:58.771 --> 40:02.650
<i>and to show them that Russia is also</i>
<i>a developed country like the others.</i>

40:07.613 --> 40:09.323
<i>But the Russians couldn't understand.</i>

41:07.047 --> 41:08.924
<i>About these sanctions.</i>

41:09.008 --> 41:14.096
These are not just a nervous reaction
of the US or its allies

41:14.179 --> 41:16.641
to our position on the events in Ukraine.

41:18.433 --> 41:20.227
<i>If none of this had happened,</i>

41:20.310 --> 41:22.396
<i>they would have come up</i>
<i>with another excuse</i>

41:22.480 --> 41:26.233
<i>to restrain the growing powers of Russia.</i>

41:28.277 --> 41:30.112
But we did not let them.

42:41.642 --> 42:44.687
There was a half-year period
of food shortages.

42:49.108 --> 42:51.652
<i>Prices skyrocketed.</i>

42:54.655 --> 42:58.200
Our society on the whole was frazzled
and confused by the situation.

44:32.127 --> 44:34.546
<i>When they sealed the borders,</i>

44:34.629 --> 44:37.174
<i>we were, so to say,</i>
<i>on the crest of the wave...</i>

44:38.633 --> 44:41.636
because we started working with
the Russian ingredients a long time ago.

44:46.350 --> 44:50.562
<i>We already had many farmers</i>
<i>who were growing produce for us.</i>

44:55.943 --> 44:59.279
<i>So we were making a living by it,</i>
<i>working with it.</i>

44:59.363 --> 45:04.034
And, all of a sudden, the embargo
helped us and pushed us further up.

45:05.870 --> 45:07.412
<i>We were ready.</i>

45:19.258 --> 45:21.676
Give out the veal!
Fish soup, hurry.

45:30.560 --> 45:32.479
<i>The main question was this:</i>

45:32.562 --> 45:35.024
<i>"So who works with Russian produce?"</i>

45:35.107 --> 45:38.443
"Vladimir Mukhin. Let's check him out.
What is he up to?

45:45.910 --> 45:47.995
<i>If he can make it work,</i>
<i>then it does work."</i>

45:50.372 --> 45:52.792
<i>All the cooks started using</i>
<i>only Russian ingredients.</i>

45:56.170 --> 45:58.672
<i>We started having different guests</i>
<i>at White Rabbit.</i>

46:02.342 --> 46:05.470
<i>They really came here with a purpose...</i>

46:07.890 --> 46:09.934
<i>to come and eat Russian cuisine.</i>

47:39.064 --> 47:43.027
Awesome.
We have such a cool soup.

47:46.113 --> 47:49.033
<i>Eventually, Father took my side.</i>

47:51.160 --> 47:57.707
Now, he closely follows my achievements
and what I am doing, always.

48:05.715 --> 48:07.968
<i>What we have now is very cool.</i>

48:10.554 --> 48:11.846
<i>I have a father as a friend.</i>

48:12.806 --> 48:14.474
To our success!

48:21.898 --> 48:26.987
<i>When I watch Vladimir,</i>
<i>I remember my own childhood and youth.</i>

48:29.823 --> 48:32.409
<i>My father used to drive me hard.</i>

48:34.328 --> 48:36.663
I didn't know why he did it.

48:39.666 --> 48:42.919
<i>Now, I know it was so I could find</i>
<i>a place in life.</i>

48:46.340 --> 48:48.217
<i>I wanted the same for Vladimir.</i>

48:51.220 --> 48:52.346
<i>White Rabbit</i>

48:52.429 --> 48:54.598
<i>is his greatest achievement.</i>

48:57.684 --> 48:58.893
<i>That wasn't me.</i>

48:58.978 --> 49:00.312
<i>I never gave this to him,</i>

49:00.395 --> 49:01.521
<i>I never ate this,</i>

49:02.231 --> 49:05.567
I never tasted or cooked it,
but it is still Russian!

49:05.650 --> 49:07.944
And Vladimir discovered it.

49:10.447 --> 49:12.241
<i>I am so proud of him.</i>

49:24.669 --> 49:27.881
<i>Vladimir now represents</i>

49:28.882 --> 49:31.635
<i>the breakthrough of Russian cuisine</i>
<i>in the international arena.</i>

49:38.350 --> 49:41.270
<i>I'm personally very happy</i>
<i>with the fact that people abroad</i>

49:42.187 --> 49:45.357
<i>can look at Russia</i>
<i>from a different angle...</i>

49:47.859 --> 49:53.948
and see us not as the enemy or
a great superpower with nuclear weapons.

49:57.577 --> 49:59.871
<i>There's an entirely different side</i>
<i>of Russia.</i>

50:04.000 --> 50:06.420
You know what came to my mind yesterday?

50:06.503 --> 50:08.338
What if we put kvass wort in there?

50:08.922 --> 50:09.923
It'll be cool.

50:10.006 --> 50:12.759
-Let's do it with kvass wort, okay?
-I'll bring it.

50:15.595 --> 50:19.058
<i>The chefs in our country,</i>
<i>they are different now.</i>

50:21.685 --> 50:25.939
<i>They started cooking new</i>
<i>and different Russian cuisine.</i>

50:29.818 --> 50:34.489
This movement is way stronger
than just a culinary movement.

50:34.573 --> 50:38.243
It's a very cool movement
that is making progress.

50:38.327 --> 50:42.247
It can change,
and it is changing, the whole system.

50:49.713 --> 50:54.218
<i>Only when we change ourselves,</i>
<i>the society will change, too.</i>

51:06.480 --> 51:07.772
<i>We have one path.</i>

51:10.234 --> 51:12.111
<i>And there's light</i>
<i>at the end of the tunnel.</i>

51:15.572 --> 51:16.990
<i>The light of the Russian cuisine.</i>
