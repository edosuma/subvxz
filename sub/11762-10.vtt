WEBVTT

00:01.172 --> 00:04.605
(dog barking)
GET OFF! AAH! DON'T BITE ME!

00:04.605 --> 00:08.008
WHY DOES EVERYONE IN THIS
CUL-DE-SAC THINK IT'S OKAY

00:08.008 --> 00:10.010
TO LET THEIR STUPID DOGS
RUN LOOSE?

00:10.010 --> 00:12.313
IT'S LIKE CALCUTTA OUT THERE.

00:12.313 --> 00:15.286
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
TRYING TO ROUND UP
ANY CRAP I CAN FIND

00:15.286 --> 00:18.289
TO REGIFT THIS CHRISTMAS,
LIKE THIS LITTLE GEM HERE--

00:18.289 --> 00:20.791
LAST YEAR'S PRESENT
FROM BOBBY'S UNCLE.

00:20.791 --> 00:25.326
RACIST UNCLE
OR DRUG DEALER UNCLE?
RACIST UNCLE. DRUG DEALER UNCLE
IS NOW PRISON UNCLE.

00:25.326 --> 00:28.629
OH, RIGHT,
BECAUSE OF DETECTIVE COUSIN.
I MISS BOBBY'S FAMILY.

00:28.629 --> 00:30.231
MORNING.

00:30.231 --> 00:32.403
WOW. IF YOU'RE WONDERING,
YOU'RE TOO COMFORTABLE.

00:32.403 --> 00:34.735
IT'S HOT.
I'M GONNA GO HOP IN YOUR POOL.

00:34.735 --> 00:38.139
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY--
FUNNY-HA HA, AND FUNNY-ERR?

00:38.139 --> 00:40.141
I SLEPT IN A RED T-SHIRT,

00:40.141 --> 00:42.643
AND YET THERE'S A LITTLE BIT
OF BLUE LINT IN HERE.

00:42.643 --> 00:48.219
DON'T YOU DARE SMELL THAT.
OH, GOOD.
NOW IT'S ON MY FLOOR.

00:48.219 --> 00:50.581
AND NO SWIMMING. JULES AND I
ARE GOING TO SPIN CLASS,

00:50.581 --> 00:53.084
AND YOU'VE GOT
TO TAKE CARE OF STAN.

00:53.084 --> 00:55.626
SO WHEN HE GETS UP,
YOU GOTTA CHANGE HIS DIAPER,

00:55.626 --> 00:59.260
AND THEN YOU GOTTA
GET HIM DRESSED.
YOU REALLY DON'T THINK
I COULD FIGURE THAT OUT?

00:59.260 --> 01:02.193
I REALLY DON'T.
FINE. OH, I LOVE THIS.
CAN I HAVE IT?

01:02.193 --> 01:04.235
SURE, BUT IT COUNTS
AS YOUR CHRISTMAS PRESENT.

01:04.235 --> 01:07.838
DEAL. (sexy voice)
I AM A SAUCY BITCH. BINK!

01:07.838 --> 01:10.171
OH, LAURIE'S SHOWING A HOUSE.
I HAVE TO REMIND HER

01:10.171 --> 01:12.173
NOT TO DESCRIBE EVERYTHING
AS "SLAMMIN'."

01:12.173 --> 01:14.175
SO THIS ROOM
IS TOTALLY SLAMMIN'.

01:14.175 --> 01:16.076
(cell phone chirps)

01:16.076 --> 01:18.549
AND BY "SLAMMIN'," I MEAN GREAT.
IT'S A GREAT ROOM.

01:18.549 --> 01:21.182
I'M FINE WITHOUT
ALL THE BLAH-BLAH.

01:21.182 --> 01:24.255
I'VE ALREADY SEEN THE HOUSE
A FEW TIMES.
A FEW TIMES?

01:24.255 --> 01:26.587
I'VE GOT A FEW TOE RINGS,
I'VE GOT A FEW DADS,

01:26.587 --> 01:28.859
AND I'VE BEEN INVOLVED
IN A FEW DOMESTIC DISPUTES.

01:28.859 --> 01:31.192
YOU'VE SEEN THIS HOUSE
EIGHT TIMES.

01:31.192 --> 01:35.596
THAT'S OFFICIALLY A BUTTLOAD.
WHAT, UH, WHAT CAN I DO
TO FIX THIS?

01:35.596 --> 01:38.729
OH, OKAY. WELL--
NO, I'M KIDDING.
I DON'T CARE. (chuckles)

01:38.729 --> 01:41.502
COME ON, BLAH-BLAH, SHOW ME
THAT KITCHEN AGAIN, HUH?

01:41.502 --> 01:44.675
COME ON, BLAH-BLAH!
COME ON!

01:44.675 --> 01:47.678
YOU KNOW,
IT'S PRETTY CROWDED IN HERE.

01:47.678 --> 01:50.341
LET'S JUST DO THAT THING WHERE
WE SIT ON THE ROWING MACHINES

01:50.341 --> 01:53.484
WITHOUT ROWING AND WATCH TV.
OH, WE CAN'T.
I HAVE MY SPINNING OUTFIT ON,

01:53.484 --> 01:55.486
NOT MY FAKE ROWING OUTFIT.
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

01:55.486 --> 01:58.549
WRISTBANDS AND THICKER UNDIES.
MORNING, CHICAS.

01:58.549 --> 02:00.551
DRINK IN MY NEW OUTFIT.

02:00.551 --> 02:04.625
BARB, YOU LOOK LIKE
A BOBSLEDDER.
WELL, I HAVE SLEDDED
DOWN A FEW BOBS.

02:04.625 --> 02:08.159
HEY! I SEE SOME NEW FACES.

02:08.159 --> 02:10.161
DWAYNE'S THE BEST.
(dance music playing)

02:10.161 --> 02:13.234
HE'S GOT A MAGICAL WAY
OF MOTIVATING PEOPLE.
OH.

02:13.234 --> 02:15.236
SADDLE UP,
YOU FAT, LAZY COWS!

02:15.236 --> 02:18.409
в™Єв™Є

02:18.409 --> 02:21.442
TRY HARDER, CAROL!

02:21.442 --> 02:24.875
(exhales deeply)

02:24.875 --> 02:28.519
в™Єв™Є

02:28.519 --> 02:30.581
(bell tinkles)

02:30.581 --> 02:33.924
в™Єв™Є

02:33.924 --> 02:36.357
AH. ISN'T THIS GREAT?

02:36.357 --> 02:39.530
DRINKING A REFRESHING
CUP OF JOE ON A BOAT--

02:39.530 --> 02:42.533
IT'S LIKE WE'RE IN ONE OF THOSE
FANCY COFFEE COMMERCIALS.

02:42.533 --> 02:45.165
THE OLD BOAT-IN-A-PARKING LOT
COFFEE COMMERCIAL. CLASSIC.

02:45.165 --> 02:48.168
WHOA, A LITTLE PRICKLIER
THAN USUAL, GREYSTOKE.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.601
BUT YOU'RE STILL LOOKING GOOD--
HANDSOME.

02:50.601 --> 02:52.603
GOD WAS NOT MULTITASKING
WHEN HE MADE YOU.

02:52.603 --> 02:55.776
NO, HE WASN'T BUILDING MOUNTAINS
AND MAKING CHICKENS AND WHATNOT.

02:55.776 --> 02:58.949
HE WAS FOCUSED.
HOW DID WE GET HERE?

02:58.949 --> 03:02.182
I DON'T KNOW. WHY SO DOWN?
I HAVE SOMETHING ON MY MIND,

03:02.182 --> 03:06.186
AND I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.
YOU KNOW WHAT MIGHT
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER?

03:06.186 --> 03:08.188
MY BUDDY FEISTY
JUST PUT A CHAINSAW

03:08.188 --> 03:10.861
ON THE END OF HIS RIFLE,
KIND OF LIKE A BAYONET.

03:10.861 --> 03:12.893
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE HEAD ON DOWN THERE

03:12.893 --> 03:16.467
FOR A DAY OF SHOOTING THINGS
AND SLICIN' 'EM UP?
YEAH, I'M NOT SURE I'M UP

03:16.467 --> 03:18.569
FOR PLAYING WITH
SOMEONE'S RIFLE-SAW.

03:18.569 --> 03:19.830
RIFLE-SAW!

03:19.830 --> 03:22.333
THAT'S A MUCH BETTER NAME
FOR THE SAW-FLE.

03:24.735 --> 03:26.737
(door closes)

03:26.737 --> 03:28.739
OHH. SPIN CLASS GUY
WAS SO HOT.

03:28.739 --> 03:30.741
I WANTED TO BE
HIS BIKE SEAT.

03:30.741 --> 03:32.743
OH. HEY, YOU NEED TO MOVE,

03:32.743 --> 03:36.947
BECAUSE IF THIS AREA IS GONNA
WORK AGAIN, IT NEEDS TO SIT.

03:36.947 --> 03:40.751
OH! THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.
OH, NO.

03:40.751 --> 03:43.223
OH, TRAVIS, TAKE ME UPSTAIRS
AND PUT ME IN A HOT BATH?

03:43.223 --> 03:46.226
THAT'S A SENTENCE I WAS HOPING
NOT TO HEAR UNTIL YOU WERE 70.

03:46.226 --> 03:49.229
HERE'S YOUR BOY.
YOU WANT TO CHECK HIM OVER,

03:49.229 --> 03:51.932
MAKE SURE HE'S OKAY?
YOU REALLY WANT ME TO
TRUST YOU MORE WITH STAN?

03:51.932 --> 03:56.006
HOW ABOUT YOU TAKE HIM TODAY?
NO INSTRUCTIONS, NOTHING.
YOU REALLY GONNA TRUST ME?

03:56.006 --> 03:58.909
I REALLY AM. BYE.
HUH. OH, THANKS, HON.
THAT MEANS A LOT.

03:58.909 --> 04:02.673
AW, THAT WAS SWEET.
YEAH, SHE DIDN'T MEAN IT,
THOUGH.

04:02.673 --> 04:05.346
SHE WANTS TO TRUST ME.
IT'S JUST NOT IN HER.
(cooing)

04:05.346 --> 04:07.017
SHE'S ALWAYS GONNA FREAK OUT
IF I BATHE HIM WRONG

04:07.017 --> 04:09.480
OR FEED HIM WRONG
OR PRETEND HE'S A TOP HAT.

04:09.480 --> 04:11.622
(chuckles)
(English accent)
HELLO, GUVNOR!

04:11.622 --> 04:13.984
INCOMING.
WHOOP.

04:16.026 --> 04:18.659
FORGOT MY PURSE.

04:18.659 --> 04:20.661
(normal voice) ALWAYS
LOOK OUT FOR THE PURSE.

04:20.661 --> 04:23.864
THEY LEAVE IT BEHIND
LIKE A LITTLE SPY.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.668
HE CALLED ME "BLAH-BLAH."

04:27.668 --> 04:30.371
I SWEAR TO GOD, JULES,
I WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM,

04:30.371 --> 04:32.603
BUT THEN WE'D NEVER SELL
THAT STUPID HOUSE,

04:32.603 --> 04:34.905
BECAUSE NO ONE WANTS
TO BUY A MURDER HOUSE

04:34.905 --> 04:37.608
EXCEPT FOR MY OLDER SISTER TINA.
SHE REGRETS IT NOW, THOUGH,

04:37.608 --> 04:39.880
BECAUSE SHE SAYS HER HOUSE IS
HAUNTED BY A COLLEGE PROFESSOR

04:39.880 --> 04:42.883
WHO TURNS ALL HER CLOTHES INSIDE
OUT AND STEALS HER YOGURT.

04:42.883 --> 04:45.285
SOMETIMES TINA LIES
FOR ATTENTION, BUT THIS TIME,

04:45.285 --> 04:49.289
I DON'T KNOW. I BELIEVE HER.
THERE IS JUST TOO MUCH PROOF.
I'M GONNA TAKE
A GIANT LEAP BACK

04:49.289 --> 04:51.291
TO THE FIRST THING
THAT YOU SAID.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.293
LOOK, JEFF IS ANNOYING,

04:53.293 --> 04:55.295
BUT WE'RE
IN THE SERVICE BUSINESS.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.628
YOU KNOW, LAURIE,
ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE LEARNED

04:57.628 --> 05:00.371
AS AN AWARD-WINNING
REAL ESTATE AGENT--
WAIT, ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT
THAT GREEN BUSINESS CERTIFICATE

05:00.371 --> 05:02.903
WE GOT FOR CHANGING
ALL OUR LIGHTBULBS?
IT'S AN AWARD.
THE POINT IS,

05:02.903 --> 05:05.035
WE DON'T LET
OUR CLIENTS RATTLE US.

05:05.035 --> 05:08.439
(laughs)
JEFF ALWAYS RATTLES YOU.

05:08.439 --> 05:11.442
NO, HE USED TO. THEN MY SHRINK
TOLD ME TO THINK OF HIM

05:11.442 --> 05:14.785
AS A TINY LITTLE MAN
WHO WEARS TINY LITTLE PANTS

05:14.785 --> 05:17.718
WHO SOMETIMES
TWIRLS A TINY LITTLE CANE

05:17.718 --> 05:20.621
IN HIS TINY LITTLE HAND.
YOUR SHRINK SOUNDS AMAZING.

05:20.621 --> 05:24.495
HE'S A GENIUS. SO NOW TINY PANTS
CAN DO WHATEVER HE WANTS TO,

05:24.495 --> 05:26.727
BECAUSE ALL I DO IS THINK
ABOUT MY COMMISSION

05:26.727 --> 05:28.799
WITH A SMILE ON MY FACE.

05:28.799 --> 05:31.061
THE HOUSE FEELS EMPTY.

05:31.061 --> 05:33.934
THAT COULD BE BECAUSE
IT ACTUALLY IS EMPTY.

05:33.934 --> 05:38.409
MAYBE. YOU LOOK BORED.
GO PLAY WITH YOUR PHONE.

05:38.409 --> 05:41.111
IS SHE ALLOWED TO TALK?
(chuckles)
I DON'T ENCOURAGE IT.

05:41.111 --> 05:43.474
LOOK, IF I'M GONNA BUY
THIS PLACE,

05:43.474 --> 05:45.616
I WANT TO SEE HOW IT FEELS
WITH MY FURNITURE IN HERE.

05:45.616 --> 05:47.918
LET'S DO THAT.

05:47.918 --> 05:50.921
DID HE JUST ORDER ME TO DO
SOMETHING BY WAVING HIS HAND?

05:50.921 --> 05:53.083
TINY PANTS, JULES.
TINY PANTS!

05:53.083 --> 05:54.685
RIGHT.
WHAT?

05:54.685 --> 05:56.757
OH, NOTHING. UM, JUST...

05:56.757 --> 05:59.960
IN MY HEAD,
YOU HAVE ON TINY PANTS.

05:59.960 --> 06:02.693
THESE ARE BIG PANTS.
IN MY HEAD, THEY'RE TINY.

06:02.693 --> 06:05.696
NO, THEY'RE NOT.
YEAH, IT DOES
SEEM IMPOSSIBLE, JULES.

06:05.696 --> 06:07.698
THOSE ARE PRETTY BIG PANTS.

06:07.698 --> 06:09.700
THEY'RE TINY,
BECAUSE IN MY HEAD,

06:09.700 --> 06:11.101
JEFF IS...
(whispers) VERY TINY.

06:11.101 --> 06:13.604
NO, I'M--I'M BIG IN YOUR HEAD.
I'M LIKE A GIANT.

06:13.604 --> 06:15.606
(normal voice)
DON'T YOU DARE TELL ME

06:15.606 --> 06:18.378
WHAT THE SIZE OF THINGS
ARE IN MY HEAD.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.481
I CALL THE SHOTS UP HERE.
YEAH. THIS IS JULES' WORLD.

06:20.481 --> 06:23.153
AND YOU CAN'T GET IN HERE,
WHICH MEANS YOU CAN'T GET TO ME.

06:23.153 --> 06:25.015
IS THAT CLEAR?

06:25.015 --> 06:29.389
BIG PANTS, BIG BELT,
BIG SHIRT, BIG SHOES.
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.762
YOU CAN'T BUY THE HOUSE,
BECAUSE I WON'T LET YOU!

06:31.762 --> 06:33.964
I'M GONNA BUY THE HOUSE,
AND I'M GONNA BURN IT.

06:33.964 --> 06:36.396
I'M GONNA BURN IT ALL!
ARE YOU FINISHED?

06:36.396 --> 06:39.530
YEAH. LET'S GO SEE
THE KITCHEN AGAIN.
PLEASE.

06:39.530 --> 06:45.936
в™Єв™Є

06:52.583 --> 06:55.115
JEFF THINKS HE'S IN MY HEAD.
HE IS SO NOT IN MY HEAD.

06:55.115 --> 06:57.448
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

06:57.448 --> 07:00.791
IS THAT SPIN CLASS BOY?
(gasps) OH, MY GOD.

07:00.791 --> 07:03.454
HE MUST BE A JEANS MODEL
FOR THAT CHEESY STORE.

07:03.454 --> 07:05.796
OR HE LOVES HIS BODY
AND LIVES HIS LIFE SHIRTLESS

07:05.796 --> 07:07.658
NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE THINKS,

07:07.658 --> 07:09.199
LIKE MATTHEW McCONAUGHEY.

07:09.199 --> 07:11.201
OH, HOW FUN WOULD IT BE

07:11.201 --> 07:13.664
TO GO TO A MOVIE
WITH A GUY LIKE THAT?
YEAH.

07:13.664 --> 07:17.708
HE WOULD LOOK
SO GREAT AT A MOVIE.
SO GO ASK HIM OUT.

07:17.708 --> 07:20.811
OH, I CAN'T.
HE'S WAY TOO YOUNG FOR ME.

07:20.811 --> 07:22.042
(horn honks in distance)

07:22.042 --> 07:25.075
THAT PAUSE WAS SO THAT
ONE OF YOU COULD JUMP IN

07:25.075 --> 07:26.947
AND SAY, "NO, HE'S NOT."
FINE.

07:26.947 --> 07:31.451
HE IS YOUNG, BUT, UM,
I CAN SENSE FROM HERE

07:31.451 --> 07:33.023
THAT HE'S AN OLD SOUL.

07:33.023 --> 07:36.827
I CAN, TOO.
WELL, THERE YOU GO.
I HAVE TO MAKE A CALL.

07:38.629 --> 07:41.862
STAN'S FINE.
QUIT CHECKING UP ON ME.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.164
I KNOW HOW
TO TAKE CARE OF OUR SON.

07:44.164 --> 07:47.067
OKAY. LOVE YOU.
(line disconnects)

07:47.067 --> 07:49.069
HELLO? OH.
(beep)

07:49.069 --> 07:50.100
WHAT IS THIS?

07:50.100 --> 07:53.043
IT'S A PLAY AREA
I BUILT FOR STAN

07:53.043 --> 07:56.076
SO I CAN TAKE A NAP.
THAT'S A BABY CAGE.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.908
IT'S A PLAY AREA.

07:57.908 --> 08:00.180
I JUST NEED YOU TO KEEP
AN EYE OUT FOR ELLIE.

08:00.180 --> 08:02.953
THERE'S 20 BUCKS
IN IT FOR YOU.
FEELS WRONG.

08:02.953 --> 08:05.115
GROW A PAIR.
IT'S TOTALLY SAFE.

08:05.115 --> 08:07.017
EXCEPT FOR THE GLASS TABLE.

08:07.017 --> 08:11.191
OH, YOU'RE RIGHT. HE MIGHT
TRY TO FIGHT HIS REFLECTION.

08:11.191 --> 08:13.994
I'D LIKE TO SEE THAT.
(growling)

08:15.926 --> 08:17.227
(doorbell rings)

08:17.227 --> 08:18.929
(door opens)

08:21.001 --> 08:23.033
WHAT? I RANG THE BELL.

08:23.033 --> 08:25.536
YEAH, MOST PEOPLE
STILL WAIT TO BE LET IN.

08:25.536 --> 08:27.037
(chuckles)
SOUNDS LIKE A TIME-WASTER.

08:27.037 --> 08:30.140
LOOK, YOU'RE MY FRIEND, AND I
WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S BUGGING YOU.

08:30.140 --> 08:33.113
I STILL DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.
WHEN I WAS MARRIED,

08:33.113 --> 08:36.116
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT
JULES ALWAYS SAID TO ME?

08:36.116 --> 08:38.018
"PLEASE STOP SLEEPING
WITH OTHER WOMEN"?

08:38.018 --> 08:41.091
SHE SAID THAT WHEN MEN SAY
THEY DON'T WANT TO TALK

08:41.091 --> 08:44.795
ABOUT SOMETHING, IT MEANS THAT
THEY REALLY DO WANT TO TALK.

08:44.795 --> 08:47.127
THEY JUST DON'T WANT
TO BE VULNERABLE.
(pats back)

08:47.127 --> 08:51.131
I JUST WANT YOU
TO LEAVE ME ALONE.
BUT YOU'RE A MAN. HOW DO I KNOW
THAT'S WHAT YOU REALLY WANT?

08:51.131 --> 08:54.034
IT IS A PICKLE.
(chuckles) I KNOW.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.066
YOU REALLY ARE
A SPACE INVADER.

08:56.066 --> 08:58.869
(barking)
WHOA! WHAT THE HELL?

08:58.869 --> 09:02.272
OH! OH, IT'S MY BAD.
I LEFT THE DOOR OPEN.
TH-THERE ARE DOGS
IN MY HOUSE!

09:02.272 --> 09:04.875
FINE, BUT AFTER I GET 'EM OUT,
WE'RE FINISHING THIS.

09:04.875 --> 09:06.877
COME ON, GUYS. COME ON.
(snaps)

09:06.877 --> 09:09.049
COME ON.
HERE WE GO. COME ON.

09:09.049 --> 09:12.953
OPEN TILL 7:00. ALL RIGHT,
I'M GONNA MAKE NOTE OF THAT.

09:12.953 --> 09:15.225
(horn honks)
HI. AREN'T YOU
IN MY SPIN CLASS?

09:15.225 --> 09:16.987
YEAH. I'M RYAN.

09:16.987 --> 09:19.930
HI, RYAN. I ALMOST
NAMED MY SON RYAN...

09:19.930 --> 09:21.932
NOT THAT I HAVE A SON,

09:21.932 --> 09:23.634
WHICH I DO.

09:23.634 --> 09:25.636
SHE'S NOT DOING BAD.
USUALLY WHEN SHE GETS NERVOUS,

09:25.636 --> 09:28.999
SHE PULLS OUT HER FINGER GUNS.
WHOOP, THERE THEY ARE.

09:28.999 --> 09:30.901
(imitates guns firing)

09:30.901 --> 09:33.604
MAKE IT STOP.
JUST MAKE IT STOP.

09:33.604 --> 09:35.706
JULES! PUT THE GUNS AWAY!

09:35.706 --> 09:39.109
(horns honk)

09:39.109 --> 09:41.712
HE'S GONNA CALL.
(imitates guns firing)

09:41.712 --> 09:44.114
AH. SO YOU GAVE HIM
YOUR NUMBER?

09:44.114 --> 09:46.286
(imitates gun firing)

09:46.286 --> 09:48.218
UGH.

09:48.218 --> 09:49.920
(Stan babbling)

09:49.920 --> 09:52.122
(mouths words)
NICE BABY CAGE.

09:52.122 --> 09:54.865
NOT A BABY CAGE.
IT'S A PLAY AREA.

09:54.865 --> 09:56.066
THERE.

09:56.066 --> 09:59.029
AND NOW HE CAN DRINK
ANYTIME HE WANTS.

09:59.029 --> 10:01.101
LIKE A GERBIL.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.173
G-MAN, I BROUGHT YOU OVER HERE
TO PROVE A POINT.

10:03.173 --> 10:06.306
NOW NO MATTER HOW HARD IT IS,
FRIENDS SHARE THINGS.

10:06.306 --> 10:09.680
ANDY,
TOUGH SHARE RIGHT NOW.
UH, THIS IS NOT MY REAL NOSE.

10:09.680 --> 10:11.682
BOOM! TRAV, YOU'RE UP.

10:11.682 --> 10:14.244
PASS. (makes puckering sounds)
FINE, I'LL GO.

10:14.244 --> 10:17.047
JUST YESTERDAY MY LITTLE DUDES
GOT REJECTED FROM A SPERM BANK.

10:17.047 --> 10:19.750
TURNS OUT THAT THE LION'S SHARE
CAN'T SWIM FOR BEANS.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.722
IT MIGHT BE
BECAUSE ON YOUR BOAT,

10:21.722 --> 10:25.095
YOU USE YOUR MICROWAVE
AS A STOOL.
HEATS ME UP NICE
ON A COLD NIGHT.

10:25.095 --> 10:28.098
NOW IT'S YOUR TURN.
SPILL IT.
NO, THANKS.

10:28.098 --> 10:30.630
HERE IT COMES.
(gasps)

10:30.630 --> 10:34.334
THAT IS THE COOLEST THING
I HAVE EVER SEEN.
(door opens and closes)

10:34.334 --> 10:37.637
AH, HE LOVES IT!
(laughs)

10:37.637 --> 10:39.639
OKAY,
THIS IS THE HOUSE AT NIGHT.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.411
IT'S VERY SIMILAR
TO THE HOUSE AT DAY,

10:41.411 --> 10:45.916
ONLY DARKER, AND MY FEET HURT,
SO I'M WEARING SLIPPERS.

10:45.916 --> 10:48.078
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE SMALLER?

10:48.078 --> 10:50.821
OR AM I JUST MAKING YOU
TINY IN MY HEAD?

10:50.821 --> 10:53.924
OKAY, MY NEW THERAPIST TOLD ME
DO NOT ENGAGE WITH YOU.

10:53.924 --> 10:55.926
WELL, THIS WON'T BE LONG.

10:55.926 --> 10:58.689
I HAVE TO MEET, UH,
WHAT'S-HER-NAME FOR TAPAS.

10:58.689 --> 11:00.861
JEFF, WHY AREN'T YOU
BUYING THIS HOUSE, HMM?

11:00.861 --> 11:03.093
IT IS PERFECT FOR YOU.
IT'S LIKE A SEX CASTLE.

11:03.093 --> 11:05.866
THERE'S PLENTY OF CLOSET SPACE
FOR ALL YOUR CONDOMS

11:05.866 --> 11:07.267
AND BODY SPRAYS.

11:07.267 --> 11:10.170
PLUS IN THE MORNING THERE'S
A HUGE SHOWER IN THE MASTER

11:10.170 --> 11:13.343
TO WASH AWAY ALL YOUR SHAME.
YOU'RE SINGLE.

11:13.343 --> 11:16.146
ARE YOU TELLING ME THAT
YOU'RE NOT PLAYING AROUND

11:16.146 --> 11:19.750
WITH SOME YOUNG GUY?
WELL, I DO HAVE A DATE TOMORROW
WITH A SLIGHTLY YOUNGER FELLOW.

11:19.750 --> 11:24.084
AH. AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO TELL
ME WHAT HE DOES FOR A LIVING?
I WOULD NOT.

11:24.084 --> 11:26.316
JULES, JUST OWN IT.
IT'S SO FREEING.

11:26.316 --> 11:28.058
HE'S A TOPLESS JEANS MODEL.

11:28.058 --> 11:30.060
IS HE ONE OF
THE AVERAGE-LOOKING GUYS

11:30.060 --> 11:33.023
THAT THEY KEEP INSIDE THE STORE,
OR IS HE ONE OF THE STUDS

11:33.023 --> 11:35.395
THAT THEY PARADE OUT FRONT?
OUT FRONT.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.227
AH.

11:37.227 --> 11:38.729
(barking)

11:38.729 --> 11:41.101
STAY AWAY FROM ME!
I'M NOT YOUR FRIEND!

11:41.101 --> 11:44.234
YOU DON'T OWN
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD!
(gasps)

11:49.309 --> 11:53.844
WAKE UP! WAKE UP! SHE'S HERE!
(groggy voice)
WHAT'S GOING ON? AH, OH.

11:53.844 --> 11:55.245
OH.

11:55.245 --> 11:57.247
HERE. HERE.

11:57.247 --> 11:59.249
ACT AWAKE.

12:02.122 --> 12:04.194
HEY.

12:04.194 --> 12:06.126
THERE SHE IS.
DID YOU MISS US?

12:06.126 --> 12:08.999
A LITTLE. WHAT'S THAT?

12:08.999 --> 12:11.962
IT'S A FORT.
HMM.

12:11.962 --> 12:14.164
(mouths words)

12:14.164 --> 12:18.408
JEFF, YOU HAVE SEEN
THIS HOUSE TEN TIMES.

12:18.408 --> 12:21.111
YOU LOVE IT? YOU HATE IT?
I DON'T EVEN CARE ANYMORE.

12:21.111 --> 12:24.945
BEST SALES PITCH EVER.
LOOK, THE PLACE IS PERFECT,

12:24.945 --> 12:27.818
BUT NOBODY WANTS TO BE
THAT CREEPY 40-YEAR-OLD

12:27.818 --> 12:30.080
WHO LIVES ALONE
IN A BIG HOUSE.

12:30.080 --> 12:32.382
MM. I GET THAT.

12:32.382 --> 12:35.085
YEAH, I-I DON'T LIKE
TO BE ALONE IN MY HOUSE.

12:35.085 --> 12:37.087
I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GONNA DO

12:37.087 --> 12:39.089
WHEN MY SON
GOES OFF TO COLLEGE.

12:39.089 --> 12:42.092
HE'S NOT REALLY BIG
ON THE IDEA OF US

12:42.092 --> 12:44.995
GETTING AN APARTMENT TOGETHER,
EVEN THOUGH I SAID

12:44.995 --> 12:47.297
I'D ONLY LIVE THERE
ON THE WEEKENDS.
WELL, HE'S MISSING OUT.

12:47.297 --> 12:50.100
MY MOM AND I ROOMED TOGETHER
WHEN I WAS IN COLLEGE,

12:50.100 --> 12:52.772
AND IT WAS
AN AMAZING EXPERIENCE.
REALLY?

12:52.772 --> 12:55.976
YEAH. WE SPOONED AT NIGHT
AND TOOK BATHS TOGETHER.

12:55.976 --> 12:59.149
(chuckles)
I DON'T REGRET A THING.
DO YOU ENJOY MOCKING ME?

12:59.149 --> 13:02.552
FOR SOME REASON,
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

13:02.552 --> 13:05.485
WOW, YOU'RE REALLY CLOSE.

13:05.485 --> 13:08.358
THIS ONLY WORKS
IF I'M CLOSE.

13:14.164 --> 13:17.097
SO, UM...

13:17.097 --> 13:19.099
WAS THAT BETTER
THAN YOUR MOM?

13:19.099 --> 13:21.872
(inhales sharply)
IT'S TOUGH TO BEAT MOM.

13:29.279 --> 13:32.112
I-I'VE HAD SOME TIME
TO THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU DID,

13:32.112 --> 13:34.244
AND I DON'T LIKE IT.
IT'S BEEN 30 SECONDS.

13:34.244 --> 13:36.887
YEAH, AND A LOT'S CHANGED.
NOW I'M MAD.

13:36.887 --> 13:40.020
NOBODY LIKES A SNEAK KISS, JEFF,
ESPECIALLY DURING FLU SEASON.

13:40.020 --> 13:43.293
YOU KISSED BACK PRETTY HARD.
WELL, I WAS TRYING TO
PUSH YOU AWAY WITH MY MOUTH.

13:43.293 --> 13:45.255
STOP OVERTHINKING EVERYTHING.

13:45.255 --> 13:48.158
I AM REALLY NOT A FAN OF PEOPLE
TELLING ME WHAT TO DO.

13:48.158 --> 13:51.231
JUST SHUSH FOR A SECOND.
SHUSHING, ON THE OTHER HAND,

13:51.231 --> 13:53.964
GETS MY PANTIES RIGHT OFF--
SERIOUSLY, BAM, JUST LIKE THAT.
(snaps fingers)

13:53.964 --> 13:55.966
OKAY. LOOK,
SINCE I'M COURTING YOU,

13:55.966 --> 13:58.608
I'LL LET YOU BE IN CONTROL
FOR A SECOND. YOU READY?
READY.

13:58.608 --> 14:01.141
I'D LIKE TO SEE IF THERE'S
SOMETHING REAL BETWEEN US.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.842
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

14:02.842 --> 14:04.945
SO I TOLD HIM
HE WAS AN ARROGANT JERK.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.977
I REDID MY LIPSTICK,
AND I LEFT.

14:06.977 --> 14:09.950
GOOD. SO FORGET HIM AND GO HAVE
FUN WITH SPIN CLASS JEANS BOY.

14:09.950 --> 14:11.952
I WILL FORGET ABOUT HIM,

14:11.952 --> 14:15.125
AND I WILL HAVE FUN
WITH SPIN CLASS JEAN BOY.
(dog whimpers)

14:15.125 --> 14:16.586
(panting)

14:16.586 --> 14:19.159
WHY IS THERE A DOG
IN MY HOUSE?

14:19.159 --> 14:22.292
MM, MY FAULT. I KEEP FORGETTING
TO CLOSE DOORS. COME ON!

14:22.292 --> 14:24.164
(whistles)
(barks)

14:24.164 --> 14:27.137
HEY.

14:27.137 --> 14:28.598
WHERE'S THE BABY CAGE?

14:28.598 --> 14:33.503
ELLIE WAS A LITTLE SUSPICIOUS,
SO I HAD TO DEVISE A NEW SYSTEM.

14:33.503 --> 14:37.908
SEE, STAN'S AN EXPLORER
LIKE MAGELLAN OR... DORA.

14:37.908 --> 14:39.910
SO I'VE GIVEN HIM
18 FEET OF SLACK

14:39.910 --> 14:42.913
AND REMOVED ALL SHARP OBJECTS
SO HE CAN WANDER SAFELY

14:42.913 --> 14:44.184
IN ANY DIRECTION.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.356
IT'S PRETTY TAUT RIGHT NOW,

14:46.356 --> 14:49.619
SO I'M GUESSING
HE'S IN THE KITCHEN.

14:49.619 --> 14:52.292
I CAN'T DECIDE
IF YOU'RE A REALLY GOOD DAD

14:52.292 --> 14:54.424
OR A REALLY BAD ONE.

14:54.424 --> 14:57.998
I AM BOTH, AND I AM NEITHER.

14:59.599 --> 15:01.531
HEY, G-MAN.

15:01.531 --> 15:04.104
WE'RE NOT OPEN
FOR BUSINESS YET.

15:04.104 --> 15:06.106
YOU AND ME ARE OPEN
FOR BUSINESS.

15:06.106 --> 15:09.279
TODAY'S THE DAY YOU SPILL
THE BEANS, BROTHER.
WHY WON'T YOU LISTEN TO ME?

15:09.279 --> 15:12.112
I FEEL LIKE IF I TOLD YOU
THAT THIS COFFEE POT

15:12.112 --> 15:14.584
WAS SCALDING HOT,
YOU'D STILL TOUCH IT RIGHT AWAY.

15:14.584 --> 15:17.317
NOW YOU OBVIOUSLY KNOW
I WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE,

15:17.317 --> 15:21.151
BUT YOU JUST PLOW THROUGH
EVERY SIGNAL I GIVE YOU.
YOU LIED, MAN. THIS AIN'T HOT.

15:21.151 --> 15:23.393
JUST LEAVE, PLEASE.
FINE, ALL RIGHT.

15:23.393 --> 15:26.156
LOOK, MAN, I JUST THOUGHT THAT
WE'D GOTTEN TO BE SO CLOSE,

15:26.156 --> 15:30.000
THAT, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WERE EVER
HURTIN', I'D BE YOUR GO-TO GUY.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.603
BUT GUESS I WAS WRONG.
ARE YOU REALLY TRYING TO
MAKE ME FEEL BAD ABOUT THIS?

15:33.603 --> 15:36.306
BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORKING.
YES, IT IS.

15:36.306 --> 15:38.308
(door opens and closes)

15:38.308 --> 15:40.940
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS PLACE?
(rock music playing)

15:40.940 --> 15:44.374
WELL, I LIKE THE WAY THE FLOOR
REALLY GRIPS MY SHOES.

15:44.374 --> 15:47.377
PLUS IT SMELLS KIND OF GOOD
IN HERE--TANGY.

15:47.377 --> 15:50.080
WE'LL GO GET US SOME BEERS.
GREAT.

15:50.080 --> 15:52.222
AND BRING US NACHOS,
OR WE'RE NOT MAKING OUT LATER.

15:52.222 --> 15:54.424
HOW DO YOU KNOW
RYAN'S FRIEND?

15:54.424 --> 15:56.326
THOSE ARE THE FIRST WORDS
I'VE EVER SPOKEN TO HIM.

15:56.326 --> 15:59.229
ARE YOU OKAY?
YOU SEEM A LITTLE MOPEY.

15:59.229 --> 16:01.161
NO! THIS IS FUN.

16:01.161 --> 16:03.163
I MEAN,
RYAN IS SUPER PRETTY.

16:03.163 --> 16:05.495
PLUS HE'S NOT AT ALL
AFRAID OF COLOGNE.

16:05.495 --> 16:07.097
AND YOU KNOW,
IT'S ONLY BEEN 20 MINUTES,

16:07.097 --> 16:09.099
BUT I'VE LEARNED SO MUCH

16:09.099 --> 16:11.201
ABOUT "THE REAL WORLD/
ROAD RULES CHALLENGE."

16:11.201 --> 16:13.303
LET'S CROSS OUR FINGERS

16:13.303 --> 16:16.746
THAT HIS APPLICATION
GETS ACCEPTED THIS YEAR!
YOU WANT TO KILL YOURSELF,
DON'T YOU?

16:16.746 --> 16:18.408
SO BADLY.

16:18.408 --> 16:21.411
LUNCH TIME. REEL HIM IN.

16:21.411 --> 16:24.084
OH.

16:24.084 --> 16:27.317
ALL RIGHT.
COME TO PAPA, BIG BOY.

16:27.317 --> 16:31.561
(floor squeaking)

16:33.323 --> 16:35.695
HE'S STRONG, LIKE HIS DADDY.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.697
(grunts)

16:37.697 --> 16:39.569
AH.

16:39.569 --> 16:41.601
OH, HEY, SWEETIE.
YOU'RE HOME.

16:41.601 --> 16:45.135
I'M GONNA GO DECIDE
WHAT YOUR CONSEQUENCES ARE.

16:45.135 --> 16:47.477
SOUNDS LIKE A PLAN.
PLUS I DON'T WANT STAN

16:47.477 --> 16:51.341
TO WITNESS THE MURDER
OF HIS FATHER.

16:51.341 --> 16:53.313
THAT'S HOW BATMAN
BECAME BATMAN.

16:53.313 --> 16:56.586
SHUT UP.

16:56.586 --> 16:59.289
I SHOULD HAVE HAD FUN
WITH SPIN CLASS JEAN BOY.

16:59.289 --> 17:00.750
I JUST COULDN'T.

17:00.750 --> 17:02.752
YEAH, I THINK
YOU DODGED A BULLET,

17:02.752 --> 17:05.295
'CAUSE AFTER YOU LEFT,
I WENT BACK TO HIS APARTMENT

17:05.295 --> 17:07.797
WITH HIM AND HIS FRIEND,
AND THEY SPENT MOST OF THE TIME

17:07.797 --> 17:09.529
MAKING OUT WITH EACH OTHER.
OH! I WOULD HAVE LIKED
TO HAVE SEEN THAT.

17:09.529 --> 17:11.531
IT WAS PRETTY HOT.
I TRIED TO GET IN THERE,

17:11.531 --> 17:15.535
BUT THEY WEREN'T
HAVING ANY OF IT.
YOU KNOW THIS IS ABOUT
THAT GUY JEFF, RIGHT?

17:15.535 --> 17:19.309
IF I HAD A CONNECTION
WITH JEFF, I'D DIVE IN.

17:19.309 --> 17:21.441
YOU WANT TO KNOW
HOW I SEE IT?
NO.

17:21.441 --> 17:24.214
YOU'RE NOT DIVING IN
BECAUSE THERE IS A CONNECTION.

17:24.214 --> 17:25.745
OOH!

17:25.745 --> 17:28.318
IT'S QUIET TIME FOR YOU.

17:28.318 --> 17:31.381
THIS GUY JEFF IS NOT SOME
YOUNG, BISEXUAL JEANS MODEL.

17:31.381 --> 17:33.753
HE'S A GROWN-UP,
AND THAT MAKES IT REAL.

17:33.753 --> 17:36.386
I DON'T THINK RYAN WAS...
(whispers) BI.

17:36.386 --> 17:38.388
I'M NOT READY
FOR SOMETHING REAL.

17:38.388 --> 17:42.061
"REAL" MEANS GETTING HURT.
AM I
IN A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION?

17:42.061 --> 17:43.733
ALMOST ALWAYS.

17:43.733 --> 17:46.566
JULES, DON'T BLOW THIS BECAUSE
YOU'RE SCARED. IT'S STUPID.

17:46.566 --> 17:48.838
OH! OKAY.

17:48.838 --> 17:50.840
OKAY. PFFT.

17:54.374 --> 17:55.405
HEY, MAN,
IS THIS A BAD TIME?

17:55.405 --> 17:59.279
YEAH. I'M DOING
SOMETHING IMPORTANT.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.481
(laughs)

18:01.481 --> 18:03.713
THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.

18:03.713 --> 18:07.287
(Just Jinger)
в™Є SHE FALLS ASLEEP в™Є

18:07.287 --> 18:10.320
WHAT'S SHAKING?

18:10.320 --> 18:12.322
в™Є THROUGH ALL THE NOISE в™Є

18:12.322 --> 18:14.424
MY EX-WIFE HAD HER BABY.

18:14.424 --> 18:16.626
BOY OR GIRL?

18:16.626 --> 18:19.229
BOY.

18:19.229 --> 18:21.271
SHE NAMED HIM TRISTAN.

18:21.271 --> 18:23.603
YOU REALLY WANTED KIDS,
DIDN'T YOU?

18:23.603 --> 18:26.376
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

18:26.376 --> 18:30.310
THAT IS HEAVY STUFF.

18:30.310 --> 18:33.383
в™Є ALL MY WEAKNESSES в™Є

18:33.383 --> 18:35.245
в™Є SHE KNOWS в™Є

18:35.245 --> 18:38.318
(laughs) HONESTLY, I'M A LITTLE
UNCOMFORTABLE RIGHT NOW.

18:38.318 --> 18:41.251
ME, TOO.
STILL GLAD YOU TOLD ME,
THOUGH.

18:41.251 --> 18:44.354
I ACTUALLY WANTED TO TALK
ABOUT IT THE WHOLE TIME.

18:44.354 --> 18:45.795
I KNOW, BROTHER.
WANT A BEER?

18:45.795 --> 18:48.328
I WANT A THOUSAND BEERS.

18:48.328 --> 18:50.860
THANKS.
(grunts) YEAH.

18:50.860 --> 18:53.763
TRISTAN'S A STUPID NAME.

18:53.763 --> 18:55.765
NO DOUBT.
(clink)

18:58.238 --> 19:01.311
ALL RIGHT, I'M READY.
BRING THE PAIN.

19:01.311 --> 19:04.614
YOU KNOW WHAT? MAYBE YOU'RE
TOO EASYGOING WITH STAN,

19:04.614 --> 19:06.616
AND I'M TOO NEUROTIC.

19:06.616 --> 19:09.419
STILL, I THINK THAT BALANCE
IS WHAT MAKES US

19:09.419 --> 19:11.421
WORK WELL AS PARENTS.

19:11.421 --> 19:15.855
WE'RE A TEAM, AND SO I'M
JUST GONNA LET THIS ONE GO.

19:15.855 --> 19:18.458
THAT'S NICE.

19:18.458 --> 19:19.859
в™Єв™Є

19:19.859 --> 19:21.891
WHY IS STAN WEARING A HAT?

19:21.891 --> 19:26.236
HE LOVES IT.
IT'S HIS HATTY HAT HAT.

19:26.236 --> 19:27.667
OH.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.199
в™Є WE DREAM в™Є

19:29.199 --> 19:31.871
HUH? OH, OH! AH, AH!
(gasps)

19:31.871 --> 19:33.943
IS THAT A CUT?

19:33.943 --> 19:35.945
IT'S NOT MY FAULT. I WAS
COMING BACK FROM JULES',

19:35.945 --> 19:39.309
AND I GOT SPOOKED BY A DOG
AND FELL INTO SOME BUSHES.

19:39.309 --> 19:42.582
ON YOUR WATCH!
HA HA HA HA!

19:42.582 --> 19:45.455
YOU REALIZE YOU'RE CELEBRATING
YOUR SON BEING HURT?

19:45.455 --> 19:48.258
IS HE HURT BADLY?
NO, IT'S JUST A SCRATCH.

19:48.258 --> 19:52.222
(falsetto voice)
HA HA! SUCK IT!

19:52.222 --> 19:53.863
в™Є ONLY YESTERDAY в™Є

19:53.863 --> 19:55.725
YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME?

19:55.725 --> 19:59.669
YES. I REALIZED THAT
I HAVE NEVER POINTED OUT

19:59.669 --> 20:02.272
THAT THIS ROOM
HAS EXPOSED BEAMS.

20:02.272 --> 20:03.533
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:03.533 --> 20:06.736
ALL RIGHT, I'M NERVOUS,
SO I NEED TO GO THROUGH

20:06.736 --> 20:10.410
THE RITUAL OF SHOWING YOU
THE HOUSE.
FINE. OKAY, UM,
TELL ME ABOUT THE PLACE.

20:10.410 --> 20:14.714
WELL, UM, THESE ARE
THE ORIGINAL HARDWOOD FLOORS.

20:14.714 --> 20:17.787
AND, UH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:17.787 --> 20:19.719
I'M BETTER.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.322
HOLD STILL.

20:22.322 --> 20:25.755
в™Є WHOLEHEARTEDLY в™Є

20:25.755 --> 20:27.727
в™Є I WILL DREAM в™Є

20:27.727 --> 20:30.760
OKAY, NOT COMPLETELY STILL.
THAT'S WEIRD.

20:30.760 --> 20:34.304
SORRY. UM, I'M NERVOUS, TOO.

20:34.304 --> 20:38.438
в™Є ANYONE ELSE в™Є

20:38.438 --> 20:41.471
BE NICE TO ME, OKAY?

20:41.471 --> 20:43.613
I WILL.

20:43.613 --> 20:45.945
GOOD. OKAY, I WAS FEELING
A LITTLE COCKY,

20:45.945 --> 20:50.350
SO I HAD SOMEONE DROP ME OFF.
YOU WANT TO TAKE ME TO DINNER?
UGH.

20:50.350 --> 20:53.423
WHAT?
UH, WHAT'S-HER-NAME'S
IN MY CAR.

20:53.423 --> 20:56.726
UNBELIEVABLE.
OH, COME ON. WE'LL--LOOK, WE'LL
BREAK UP WITH HER TOGETHER.

20:56.726 --> 20:59.559
OKAY, FINE, BUT I AM NOT
RIDING IN THE BACK.

20:59.559 --> 21:02.892
YOU GUYS CAN
JUST SQUEEZE IN, YEAH?

21:09.369 --> 21:11.471
HEY, YOU GUYS READY?
HELL, YEAH.

21:11.471 --> 21:12.872
LET'S DO THIS.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.004
ONE, TWO, THREE!
(grunts)

21:15.004 --> 21:17.407
AAH! OKAY, ONE, TWO, THREE.

21:17.407 --> 21:19.749
(all grunting)

21:19.749 --> 21:21.651
WHOO-HOO-HOO-HOO!

21:21.651 --> 21:24.384
SLOWER THAN I THOUGHT,
BUT STILL FUN.

21:24.384 --> 21:26.356
YOU WANT TO GO NEXT?
NO.

21:26.356 --> 21:28.658
YOUR LOSS. (chuckles)

21:28.658 --> 21:31.421
(thud)
OHH! AAH! DOOR JAMB! MOTHER!
WHOO-HOO-HOO-HOO!

21:31.421 --> 21:33.393
(dog whines)

21:33.393 --> 21:34.894
(barks)

21:34.894 --> 21:37.897
I'M SURROUNDED
BY DOGS AND IDIOTS.
