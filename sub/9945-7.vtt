Tickets this way

00:08.200 --> 00:11.670
Come and watch pikeys
making a mess of the lives

00:11.760 --> 00:15.116
they were given by him upstairs

00:15.200 --> 00:18.431
and kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:18.520 --> 00:23.435
What sounds on earth could
ever replace kids needing money

00:23.520 --> 00:25.476
or wives in your face?

00:25.560 --> 00:29.235
Cos this, people reckon -
and me included - is why

00:29.320 --> 00:34.633
pubs and drugs were kindly
invented - to calm us all down,

00:34.720 --> 00:36.995
to stop us going mental.

00:37.080 --> 00:41.517
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:41.600 --> 00:46.071
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes.

00:46.160 --> 00:49.914
You shit on our heads,
but you pay the taxes.

00:53.480 --> 00:56.438
Imagine a Britain without
Chatsworth buccaneers

00:56.520 --> 00:59.876
who'd come on your face
for the price of a beer.

00:59.960 --> 01:03.794
Make poverty history!
Cheaper drugs now!

01:03.880 --> 01:06.155
Make poverty history!

01:06.240 --> 01:07.832

01:11.360 --> 01:12.713

01:17.320 --> 01:21.199
<i>(Monica) A very important
business person once said,</i>

01:21.280 --> 01:23.748
<i>if you do nothing in life,</i>

01:23.840 --> 01:26.513
<i>well, then you become nothing.</i>

01:28.280 --> 01:30.953
<i>You have to get out there
and make it happen.</i>

01:31.040 --> 01:33.838
<i>Come to think of it, it was
someone off The Apprentice.</i>

01:33.920 --> 01:37.469
<i>They got fired
in the first week, but...</i>

01:37.560 --> 01:39.152
<i>you get the point, don't you?</i>

01:41.920 --> 01:45.037
<i>It's up to you to get what you want.</i>

01:45.120 --> 01:47.270
<i>If all you want in life
is to be needed,</i>

01:47.360 --> 01:49.555
<i>then you have to
make yourself needed.</i>

01:49.640 --> 01:53.155
<i>Look out for people - help them
when they're struggling.</i>

01:53.240 --> 01:55.913
<i>Always try to do the right thing.</i>

01:56.000 --> 01:58.514
<i>Or, the best way to get people</i>

01:58.600 --> 02:03.196
<i>to want, need and love you
is to just stop short.</i>

02:03.280 --> 02:08.673
<i>From Marilyn Monroe
to Kurt Cobain, just...stop...short.</i>

02:08.759 --> 02:13.356
<i>Always...always leave them
wanting more.</i>

02:16.480 --> 02:19.233
- Debbie! Stella.
- No way!

02:19.320 --> 02:21.038
My washer's broke!

02:21.120 --> 02:22.599

02:23.640 --> 02:25.631

02:25.720 --> 02:27.472
Maxine, Carl - towels!

02:27.560 --> 02:30.233
It's like being on Ward 3C
all over again.

02:30.320 --> 02:32.709
- Maternity?
- Geriatrics.

02:32.800 --> 02:34.995
Norma!

02:35.080 --> 02:37.833
Fucking noise in this place!

02:37.920 --> 02:40.036
Oh! Quick, let us through!

02:40.120 --> 02:43.669
Can't you shit in a carrier bag
in the yard, you fucking tinker?

02:43.760 --> 02:44.715
I'm not here for the bog.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.075
Washer's broke.
Sorry we disturbed you.

02:47.160 --> 02:48.229
Where are you going?

02:48.320 --> 02:49.833

03:29.640 --> 03:31.119
What've you dug that out for?

03:31.200 --> 03:34.237
Me and Kell are making

03:34.320 --> 03:35.878
Who'd wanna watch you two at it?

03:35.960 --> 03:37.632
We'll make a fortune!

03:37.720 --> 03:40.518
A picture is worth a thousand words.

Make more than your

03:45.600 --> 03:47.716
Argh! I'll fucking kill ya!

Sorry, I didn't mean
to be any bother.

04:04.600 --> 04:07.478
I just wanted to drop this in.

04:07.560 --> 04:10.358
Well, it is today, isn't it?

04:10.440 --> 04:11.759
Yeah, it is.

04:11.840 --> 04:14.195
Thought so. Here you are.

04:14.280 --> 04:21.231
"Past is history, future's a mystery,
present's a gift."

04:23.440 --> 04:26.591
That's what it should've said.
I'm not very good at icing.

04:26.680 --> 04:28.477
Thanks. It's dead nice of you, that.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.949
And, don't worry,
I made it with raspberry jam,

04:31.040 --> 04:33.190
cos I know Paddy
doesn't like strawberry.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.753
Is he around?

04:37.840 --> 04:40.832
- Any minute now.
- Right.

04:43.240 --> 04:44.468
Well...

04:44.560 --> 04:46.710
I'd best leave you to it.

04:50.680 --> 04:52.033
Shall I chuck it?

04:52.120 --> 04:53.838
Don't be so ungrateful!

04:53.920 --> 04:55.638
Take it over there.

04:55.720 --> 04:57.790
And if you drop it,
I'll fucking drop you.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.277
Dad'll be back, I know it.

05:04.360 --> 05:06.396
Course he will -

05:06.480 --> 05:08.994
He'd walk across broken glass

15:30.800 --> 15:32.836
What colour? Quickly!

15:32.920 --> 15:34.592
Black. Er... bluey,

15:34.680 --> 15:36.591
greeny, reddy?

15:38.120 --> 15:39.519
Libby, where are you?

15:39.600 --> 15:41.556
OK, come on. Come on. Come on.

15:48.080 --> 15:50.071
MOANING AND PANTING

15:50.160 --> 15:52.310
I'm sorry.

15:53.400 --> 15:56.756
I just wanted to know
what everyone's doing,

15:56.840 --> 16:00.389
you know, when they go
to their bedrooms and...

16:00.480 --> 16:03.040
MOANING AND PANTING FROM UPSTAIRS

16:05.120 --> 16:08.351
Right, well, I'll best be
getting back to the Jockey, then.

16:08.440 --> 16:10.396
I'll catch you up.

16:10.480 --> 16:13.517
As soon as we've had a little chat
about the birds and the bees.

16:16.480 --> 16:17.629
MOANING AND PANTING

16:17.720 --> 16:22.350
Let me have it. Hey, Frank?
You gonna let me have it?

16:22.440 --> 16:25.750
- What is it? What do you want?
- Do you want me, Frank?

16:25.840 --> 16:27.068
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

16:27.160 --> 16:28.513
Say it.

16:28.600 --> 16:32.149
I fucking want you, Monica Gallagher!
Yeeaaahh!

16:35.360 --> 16:38.591
Oh, don't stop. Don't stop, Mon!
What you stopped for? Whoa!

16:38.680 --> 16:41.114
Whoa! What the fuck? Monica!

16:41.200 --> 16:43.760
If you have all your sweets at once,
you'll be sick.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.432
You what?

16:46.640 --> 16:50.076
Always leave 'em wanting more!

16:54.280 --> 16:57.397
- It must be on the other camera.
- This is the other camera.

16:57.480 --> 16:59.994
- We'll have to call the police.
- No!

17:01.240 --> 17:02.559
Thank you.

17:03.680 --> 17:05.477
Hiya.

17:06.560 --> 17:08.436
I'm from next door...

17:10.319 --> 17:12.550
We've got a party to get to!

17:52.320 --> 17:53.753
GIGGLING

18:01.480 --> 18:03.038
What you doing?

18:03.120 --> 18:04.712
Letting the sunshine in!

18:04.800 --> 18:08.156
- You're mental.
- I'm not mental!

18:08.240 --> 18:12.153
He's a kid. You're trying
to seduce a poor little kid.

18:12.240 --> 18:13.309
I wasn't trying to...

18:13.400 --> 18:16.312
Hey, Mrs Mental,
curtsy before your queen,

18:16.400 --> 18:18.914
Queen Mental of the...
fucking mentalists!

18:21.320 --> 18:23.595
Oh, that's it, run away.

18:25.520 --> 18:26.873
I am not running away.

18:26.960 --> 18:29.474
I've got a party
to go to at the Jockey.

18:29.560 --> 18:31.790
Why didn't you say so?

18:49.360 --> 18:51.476
Have you got hollow legs
or something?

18:53.080 --> 18:54.513
Cheeky twat.

18:57.280 --> 18:58.235
I what?

18:59.880 --> 19:01.791
I talk? Speak?

19:01.880 --> 19:06.032
I speak sign. Do I speak sign?

19:06.120 --> 19:08.998
Why? Because I understand that?

19:16.560 --> 19:18.198
Come on, I got big plans.

19:18.280 --> 19:20.350
I made big plans tonight.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.595
Yeah, great, I win again.
That's another 500 quid you owe me.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.713
You nutter.

19:55.920 --> 19:58.354
MUSIC: Insomnia by Faithless

20:18.840 --> 20:20.273
You all right?

20:21.880 --> 20:23.518
TURNS VOLUME UP

20:23.600 --> 20:26.034
You've been dreaming.
D'ya fall off a wall?

20:51.800 --> 20:55.076
And she says to the guy, "I'm here
about the clit-licking frog."

20:55.160 --> 20:57.913
And the guy turns around and goes,
"Bonjour, madame!"

20:58.000 --> 20:59.479
LAUGHTER

21:02.080 --> 21:04.833
Hey, can you sing
Over The Hills And Far Away?

21:08.000 --> 21:10.719
I usually only like
that opera singer with cancer

21:10.800 --> 21:12.119
but this has grown on me.

21:12.200 --> 21:13.952
It's Paddy's favourite song.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.713
♪ Cos nobody showed us... ♪

21:16.800 --> 21:18.916
TOILET FLUSHES

21:27.760 --> 21:29.193
There you are.

21:30.240 --> 21:33.312
- Y'all right?
- Yeah. You?

21:33.400 --> 21:34.879
Yeah.

21:34.960 --> 21:38.919
- D'ya think Dad's all right?
- Yeah, he's all right.

21:39.000 --> 21:41.798
How do you know?

21:41.880 --> 21:44.474
I'd have heard if he'd been
kidnapped, tortured,

21:44.560 --> 21:47.870
beaten or murdered.
I would hear these things.

21:50.120 --> 21:52.873
- So what is it, then?
- Another woman?

21:54.360 --> 21:56.749
- Happens all the time.
- Not to these two, it don't.

21:56.840 --> 21:58.831
They're solid as a rock.

22:02.080 --> 22:03.559
You don't...

22:03.640 --> 22:06.871
- He worships you.
- Could be another woman.

22:10.640 --> 22:12.995
Probably not, though, eh?

22:31.440 --> 22:32.873
There you go.

22:32.960 --> 22:36.396
Car and grandson delivered
safe and sound.

22:45.680 --> 22:46.749
Thank you.

22:50.640 --> 22:52.278
Thank you?

22:54.640 --> 22:57.996
No problem, mate.
You take care of yourself, yeah?

23:08.840 --> 23:10.273
Danny! Oi!

23:10.360 --> 23:11.475
Oi!

23:11.560 --> 23:13.994
Danny, how do you say goodbye?

23:28.200 --> 23:30.509
Are you Mormons?

23:31.560 --> 23:34.028
- No.
- You look like Mormons.

23:35.640 --> 23:38.518
Are you sure you're not Mormons?

23:38.600 --> 23:40.431
Yeah, I'm pretty sure, yeah.

23:40.520 --> 23:42.112
We don't want Mormons round here.

23:42.200 --> 23:45.988
Maybe her at number 28
will let you in

23:46.080 --> 23:49.516
but stay away from mine, number 16.

23:49.600 --> 23:52.592
And don't bother number 14 either.

23:52.680 --> 23:55.831
They've got a backward kiddy
living with them.

23:55.920 --> 23:59.390
And there's no point in
him knocking on there -

23:59.480 --> 24:02.392
the old fella that lived there
died last week.

24:17.600 --> 24:19.670
- Your tea.
- Thanks.

24:21.720 --> 24:23.551
- All right, Mon?
- Going for a bath?

24:23.640 --> 24:26.200
Aye. Running late an 'all,
with the washer.

24:26.280 --> 24:27.395
Off anywhere nice?

24:27.480 --> 24:31.792
Just the Maguire do at the Jockey,
you know? Are you not going?

24:31.880 --> 24:33.598
Haven't been invited.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.272
Just turn up. You'll be all reet.

24:35.360 --> 24:38.113
I'm sure nobody'll
notice you anyway.

24:46.280 --> 24:47.793
What was that for?

24:49.000 --> 24:50.433
Old times.

24:54.320 --> 24:56.629
Well, you'd best go and get ready.

25:01.640 --> 25:03.073
See ya!

25:04.360 --> 25:06.669
CHEERING

25:06.760 --> 25:10.309
Thank you very much.
Right then, we've now reached

25:10.400 --> 25:12.914
a very special point
in the celebrations.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.355
Oh, yes. Let's get
the happy couple up here.

25:15.440 --> 25:19.797
Come on, let's hear it
for Mimi and Patrick!

25:21.040 --> 25:23.270
Here she is! Come on.

25:23.360 --> 25:25.510
Here she is, darling.

25:25.600 --> 25:27.397
She's a little cracker!

25:27.480 --> 25:30.597
Brace yourself, Mimi.
We've got a little surprise for you.

25:31.720 --> 25:33.836
CHURCH BELLS RING ON VIDEO

25:33.920 --> 25:37.435
So where's the lucky fella, then?
Where is he?

25:37.520 --> 25:39.351
Don't be shy, Patrick!

25:39.440 --> 25:41.476
Where are you, Patrick?

25:46.880 --> 25:49.075
SOBS

26:04.760 --> 26:07.593
That's not the angle
WE filmed it from.

26:07.680 --> 26:09.159
Who else would have filmed us?!

26:10.440 --> 26:11.475
Ah.

26:12.680 --> 26:14.591
He wouldn't have done it on his own.

26:14.680 --> 26:16.716
Who else would have helped him?

26:20.440 --> 26:21.998
Proper dirty.

26:33.240 --> 26:36.676
I was only having a laugh! I was gonna
give you a cut and everything.

26:36.760 --> 26:38.159
Shane, please!

26:38.280 --> 26:40.157
I'm getting a headache.

26:53.040 --> 26:54.473
What time is it?

27:01.160 --> 27:03.071
Shall we?

27:03.160 --> 27:05.390
There's no point staying here.

27:16.760 --> 27:18.398
Where is everybody?

27:20.400 --> 27:21.594
We could take it all.

27:21.680 --> 27:25.275
Yeah, if we could walk
through locked doors.

27:25.360 --> 27:28.670
Every single thing.
We could fill your house with it!

27:28.760 --> 27:30.910
DOOR OPENS

27:31.000 --> 27:32.433
Quick, someone's coming!

28:05.400 --> 28:06.799
Off out?

28:06.880 --> 28:08.632
Just getting some bread.

28:08.720 --> 28:10.153
OK.

28:16.200 --> 28:19.112
See you later, kid.

- Yeah! You all right?
- I knew you'd come back.

29:39.040 --> 29:41.679
I'm only here for a couple of days.

29:41.760 --> 29:43.955

- All right.

29:44.040 --> 29:45.996
He's deaf.

29:46.080 --> 29:48.071
I've got an Xbox.

29:51.320 --> 29:53.311
There's a deaf girl in our school.

Wanna kill some zombies?

30:02.760 --> 30:04.432
Where is everyone?

30:04.520 --> 30:05.999
The Jockey.

30:07.400 --> 30:08.435
Course.

30:08.520 --> 30:11.592
Except Debbie -
she's gone shopping with Max.

30:13.000 --> 30:13.955
Who?

30:14.040 --> 30:17.476
And Mum - she's nipped out
for some bread.

30:23.560 --> 30:24.788
Bread?

30:24.880 --> 30:26.552
KNOCKING

30:28.920 --> 30:30.399
Hang on!

30:30.480 --> 30:34.109
- Lan? What are you doing here?
- I heard you banging.

30:34.200 --> 30:35.474
In lbiza?

30:35.560 --> 30:37.118
Monica's gone.

30:37.200 --> 30:38.394
Gone?

30:38.480 --> 30:41.756
Get everyone from the pub.
Tell 'em Monica's gone for bread.

30:41.840 --> 30:43.193
Go on, quick!

30:52.560 --> 30:53.993
Mimi...

30:59.240 --> 31:00.559
Monica...

31:00.640 --> 31:02.596
She wouldn't just go
like that, not again.

31:02.680 --> 31:04.796
Wonder if it's a bird
or a fella this time.

31:04.880 --> 31:07.155
CRIES

31:07.240 --> 31:11.472
Past is history, future's a mystery.

31:33.640 --> 31:35.915
She's not fit to be called a mother.

31:38.080 --> 31:40.071
Well, we all knew
she'd fuck off again.

31:40.160 --> 31:41.275
Ssh!

31:41.360 --> 31:42.315
He needs to be told!

31:42.400 --> 31:45.551
What, like Deaf Boy needs
to be told his granddad's dead?

31:45.640 --> 31:46.629
BABY CRIES

31:46.720 --> 31:48.472
What am I supposed to do,
just tell him?

31:48.560 --> 31:50.118
"Good luck, Danny. Fuck off."

31:50.200 --> 31:51.633
It's what you did to us.

31:51.720 --> 31:53.790
Piss off!
That's completely different.

31:53.880 --> 31:58.396
It's good that you're back, kid,
you know, for... Stella and that.

31:58.480 --> 32:01.916
I'm not staying, and I'm not gonna
be stuck here looking after kids.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.355
- But I should?
- They're your kids!

32:04.440 --> 32:06.874
What was that for?!

32:08.400 --> 32:09.992
He said Mum's gone.

32:12.960 --> 32:16.191
- And you told him?
- His granddad's dead.

32:21.360 --> 32:22.588
Danny!

32:23.640 --> 32:27.713
Danny! It's all right.
It's all right.

32:27.800 --> 32:29.279
It's all right.

32:31.400 --> 32:34.073
It's all right.

32:41.120 --> 32:42.519
Come here.

32:44.280 --> 32:47.511
Wouldn't it be great
if all the clothes in here were ours?

32:47.600 --> 32:50.194
Lt'd be like the best thing
in the world ever.

32:51.280 --> 32:55.558
Yeah, but when and where
would we wear any of it?

32:55.640 --> 32:58.757
Down the Jockey
or outside the chip shop?

32:58.840 --> 32:59.795
Mmm.

32:59.880 --> 33:02.348
It's just all so...

33:02.440 --> 33:05.352
- Not us?
- Yeah, it's not us.

33:05.440 --> 33:07.192
Well, someone must like this stuff.

33:10.800 --> 33:12.950
Someone does.

33:19.480 --> 33:21.914
I don't want to see you
here again, all right?

33:22.000 --> 33:23.638
Don't worry, you won't.

33:27.240 --> 33:28.958
Has anyone ever told you

33:29.040 --> 33:30.678
- you look like one of the Sugababes?
- No.

33:30.760 --> 33:31.829
Well, you do.

33:31.920 --> 33:34.070
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

33:34.160 --> 33:36.913
If you went a little bit higher
with your blusher,

33:37.000 --> 33:38.638
you'd get more definition.

33:38.720 --> 33:40.517
Max!

33:43.440 --> 33:45.431
LAUGHTER

33:53.480 --> 33:54.595
Did you know?

33:54.680 --> 33:56.193
'Kin' hell!

33:56.280 --> 33:57.918
- Did ya?
- What?

33:58.000 --> 34:00.116
Paddy and Monica. Did you know?

34:00.200 --> 34:03.431
- Paddy and Monica?
- They're together, aren't they?

34:05.000 --> 34:07.195
Paddy... and Monica?

34:08.239 --> 34:10.071
Paddy and Monica?

34:12.520 --> 34:14.829
Paddy and Monica?!

34:27.120 --> 34:29.793
I'm not coming in. I can't.

34:29.880 --> 34:34.556
I fly back out tomorrow and...
I don't want to do this, sorry.

34:34.639 --> 34:38.474
I've got to get off, be myself -
no responsibility, you know?

34:43.239 --> 34:47.119
Yeah, you did that. You might
well look sheepish, you twat.

34:50.239 --> 34:51.195
What?

34:53.280 --> 34:55.714
I'll call your auntie
and tell her what happened.

34:55.800 --> 34:57.950
You take care of yourself,
all right?

35:05.040 --> 35:06.155
Yeah, and you!

35:07.560 --> 35:08.788
Yeah, whatever.

35:08.880 --> 35:10.518
Whatever.

35:23.160 --> 35:25.196
She's always been a bit...

35:25.280 --> 35:26.633
Ioose.

35:28.040 --> 35:31.715
I think she had a thing with
the midwife when Carl was born.

35:31.800 --> 35:33.916
Paddy.

35:34.000 --> 35:36.560
Paddy had a "thing" once...

35:37.800 --> 35:40.792
...before we were married.
- But you were together?

35:40.880 --> 35:41.915
Yeah.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.629
I don't think he even kissed
this other girl or anything...

35:45.720 --> 35:48.280
but he...

35:48.360 --> 35:49.952
he thought about it.

35:51.600 --> 35:55.195
He swore to me he wasn't interested
in her, but I smelt it on him.

35:56.800 --> 35:59.030
Then I said to him,
"You ever think about it again,

35:59.120 --> 36:02.078
"think about another woman,

36:02.160 --> 36:06.392
"then I just want you to go with her.
Don't ever come back, just go."

36:12.760 --> 36:14.159
He's not with Monica.

36:15.840 --> 36:16.795
How d'you know?

36:18.400 --> 36:21.870
I bet she'd want to be with him,
but Paddy wouldn't want to be with her.

36:24.960 --> 36:26.393
You're a woman.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.591
Monica's a child.
