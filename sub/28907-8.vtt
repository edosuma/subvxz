Richard:
"fast n' loud" was taped in
front of a live studio audience.

00:03.630 --> 00:09.500
â™ª

00:09.510 --> 00:12.340
alright, I need that sign placed
just on top of that truck.

00:12.340 --> 00:14.580
Steve:
Well, you want to be able to
see it from the street, right?

00:14.580 --> 00:15.980
Richard:
What we're doing is we're
pointing right there

00:15.980 --> 00:17.280
towards the merch shop.

00:17.280 --> 00:18.680
-How'd we do?
-I don't know.

00:18.680 --> 00:20.080
I don't think
it's right, man.

00:20.080 --> 00:22.180
I think that y'all don't
understand what a line is.

00:22.180 --> 00:24.580
I'm in the process
of making perfection.

00:24.590 --> 00:27.820
-Oh, here we go.
-Here we go.

00:27.820 --> 00:29.060
Look at that.

00:29.060 --> 00:31.560
Hold on.

00:31.560 --> 00:33.030
Get on up there, steve.

00:33.030 --> 00:34.530
Start welding that sucker.

00:34.530 --> 00:36.300
Where do you want this at?
You put that on your nipple?

00:36.300 --> 00:40.070
I'm going to put that
on my nipple ring.

00:40.070 --> 00:42.500
If you catch my hair on fire
it'll be a problem, son.

00:42.510 --> 00:45.370
All that product.

00:45.370 --> 00:48.580
I see fire, steve.

00:48.580 --> 00:50.440
All right.
Y'all guys clean this stuff up.

00:50.450 --> 00:52.510
Russell: He always leaves
when there's work to do.

00:52.520 --> 00:56.120
Well, my self-esteem
has never been lower.

whoo!

Right now on "fast n' loud"...

01:06.660 --> 01:08.330
Hot-rod hunter richard rawlings

01:08.330 --> 01:13.800
and the gas monkey crew build
a plymouth wagon brady-style...

01:13.800 --> 01:15.940
-Kids all right back there?
-Yeah. Are we there yet?

01:15.940 --> 01:18.810
-I got to pee.
-...For a blast from the past.

01:18.810 --> 01:20.710
Wow. So this is where
it all happened?

01:20.710 --> 01:23.410
I'm barry williams, and I'm greg
from "the brady bunch."

01:23.410 --> 01:25.680

up his sleeve.

01:25.680 --> 01:27.210

01:27.220 --> 01:29.520
-and...
-Dude, it is awful.

01:29.520 --> 01:31.250
Narrator:
...The monkeys get a camaro...
You got brakes?

01:31.250 --> 01:32.690
-Does it have brakes?
-I think.

01:32.690 --> 01:33.890
-Aah!
-You better check.

01:33.890 --> 01:35.390
Narrator:
...And grounded...

01:35.390 --> 01:36.460
No goofing around.

01:36.460 --> 01:38.490
No doing burnouts.
-Oh, [bleep]

01:38.490 --> 01:39.830
-no.
-No, we would never do that.

01:39.830 --> 01:41.830
-...While richard...
-What's up with the van?

01:41.830 --> 01:45.130
-...Barters with more than cash.
-I do like those shoes.

01:45.130 --> 01:46.400
What do you want for those?

01:46.400 --> 01:49.140
I want all the money
in your pocket and the van.

01:49.140 --> 01:52.010
Narrator: All that and more
coming up on...

01:58.010 --> 01:59.280
I want to rip all this out

01:59.280 --> 02:03.720
and make it real red
leather not pleather.

02:03.720 --> 02:06.190
Real...
Like what quality leather?

02:06.190 --> 02:07.990
Like rolls-royce quality.

02:07.990 --> 02:09.160
Richard: It's another day here
at gas monkey,

02:09.160 --> 02:11.690
but today is not normal
because we've got

02:11.690 --> 02:14.860
a special guest coming by,
none other than barry williams

02:14.860 --> 02:16.900
from "the brady brunch,"
greg brady.

02:16.900 --> 02:18.770
Not to brag or anything,
but when you're a famous,

02:18.770 --> 02:19.970
kickass hot-rod shop

02:19.970 --> 02:22.000
with an awesome inventory
like gas monkey,

02:22.000 --> 02:24.000
you tend to get a few celebs
who want to pop in

02:24.010 --> 02:25.940
and see what all
the hub-bub is about.

02:25.940 --> 02:27.670
Suckers!

02:27.680 --> 02:30.340
Richard:
But I have a funny feeling that
barry ain't quite a lookie-loo.

02:30.350 --> 02:32.110
Do you know if my radiator
is in for the cadillac yet?

02:32.110 --> 02:33.510
It actually did just come in.

02:33.520 --> 02:34.980
-Hey.
-Yo!

02:34.980 --> 02:36.550
-But it's going to take...
-Richard, hi, barry williams.

02:36.550 --> 02:37.780
Oh, my god.
Mr. Williams, richard rawlings.

02:37.790 --> 02:38.920
Greg brady.
Nice to meet you.

02:38.920 --> 02:39.920
Right on.
Wow.

02:39.920 --> 02:41.120
So this is where
it all happens, huh?

02:41.120 --> 02:42.120
How are you? Russell.
Russell, nice to meet you.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.490
Big fan.
Nice to meet you. Good.

02:43.490 --> 02:47.660
I'm barry williams, and I'm greg
from "the brady bunch."

02:47.660 --> 02:49.960
"the brady bunch" has had
a pretty remarkable history.

02:49.970 --> 02:56.040
We did 5 original years,
1969 to 1974, did 119 episodes.

02:56.040 --> 03:01.510
It's never been off the air
since we first went on,

03:01.510 --> 03:03.510
and that's now 50 years.

03:03.510 --> 03:05.150
This is where it all goes down.

03:05.150 --> 03:06.780
These are some of the toys.

03:06.780 --> 03:09.820
Wow, this place is amazing.
I mean, it's like...

03:09.820 --> 03:12.020
For a kid, it would be like
a candy factory.

03:12.020 --> 03:13.590
So I'm here.
I'm getting the royal tour.

03:13.590 --> 03:16.020
Richard is being very generous
here with his time

03:16.030 --> 03:18.090
showing me his favorite cars.

03:18.090 --> 03:20.530
Yeah,
'65 mustang with a stock.

03:20.530 --> 03:22.560
You could get in trouble
in this car.

03:22.570 --> 03:24.800
Oh, yeah.
It's stock look but not stock.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.830
Oh, stop!
Come on.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.500
It's a real k-code '65,

03:28.500 --> 03:30.000
but we just added
a little extra to it.

03:30.010 --> 03:32.310
Do you clean this
with a toothbrush?

03:32.310 --> 03:33.570
No, it's called a keke.

03:33.580 --> 03:36.680
He works over
in the paint shop.

03:36.680 --> 03:38.150
Barry: I've got my eye
on a couple of them.

03:38.150 --> 03:41.920
There's a nice-looking mustang
out there in the showroom

03:41.920 --> 03:44.020
that I wonder
if he'd ever part with.

03:44.020 --> 03:46.620
I'm not sure.
This is my '31 caddy,

03:46.620 --> 03:48.220
or, actually, it's a '30.
Nice.

03:48.220 --> 03:50.260
I drive it quite a bit,
but the radiator gave out,

03:50.260 --> 03:52.730
and it took us about 6 months to
get a company to custom make...

03:52.730 --> 03:54.560
That looks like a good Sunday
afternoon car.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.330
And flip the seat back.

03:56.330 --> 03:58.700
Oh, I flip the seat back
and throw my driver up there,

03:58.700 --> 04:01.170
and me and the girls
sit in the back, sip champagne.

04:01.170 --> 04:02.770
That's the place to ride.
Right?

04:02.770 --> 04:03.900
Jump seat, mm-hmm.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.110
All right.

04:05.110 --> 04:07.410
We'll go over here
to the monkey trap.

04:07.410 --> 04:10.780
Greg brady.
That's what I call it.

04:10.780 --> 04:13.150
This is where I keep
all my toys.

04:13.150 --> 04:15.350
Wow, it looks...
To me, it looks like a toy shop.

04:15.350 --> 04:16.650
It is.
Wow.

04:16.650 --> 04:18.620
It is pretty wild.
Adult toys.

04:18.620 --> 04:19.850
What the heck?
Come on.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.690
That's an adult tricycle.
Adult toy.

04:21.690 --> 04:23.320
Oh, I can see you can
spin the tires.

04:23.330 --> 04:24.890
Well, I had to put it on here,
"do not touch,"

04:24.890 --> 04:26.730
because this is literally
the most dangerous thing

04:26.730 --> 04:29.000
in this shop other than me
with tools in my hand.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.160
How do you
start it again?

04:30.170 --> 04:31.570
Yeah.
Oh, no!

04:31.570 --> 04:32.930
Gas pedal?
You'll have to sign a waiver.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.200
I'm ready. I'm ready.
Let's go.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.770
It's a lot of fun.
That is some fun.

04:36.770 --> 04:38.970
You can run it with...

04:38.970 --> 04:42.640
See I just...I like signs that,
you know, like that.

04:42.650 --> 04:45.610
Well, daphne put that on there
because literally nobody

04:45.610 --> 04:49.180
is insured to ride this thing,
and you will get hurt.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.320
You know,
if you watch the show,

04:54.320 --> 04:55.760
we build a lot of different
stuff all the time.

04:55.760 --> 04:57.120
Boy, I'll say.
All right.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.660
This is what we call
a barn find.

04:58.660 --> 05:01.300
I found it in tulsa, actually,
and it had been in the guy's

05:01.300 --> 05:05.700
backyard-garage-barn thing
since, like, 1952,

05:05.700 --> 05:08.600
and it's a '34 ford,
so it had fenders,

05:08.600 --> 05:10.200
and it was
kind of original looking,

05:10.210 --> 05:12.670
but we wanted to build
a period-correct,

05:12.680 --> 05:15.440
'70s show-drag car.

05:17.850 --> 05:19.310
This is all original?
No.

05:19.320 --> 05:20.380
Oh.
We chopped.

05:20.380 --> 05:22.020
This is...All this?
We chopped it.

05:22.020 --> 05:23.380
We ripped off all the fenders.

05:23.390 --> 05:24.790
We rebuilt everything on it.

05:24.790 --> 05:26.390
There's not a nut or bolt
on this car

05:26.390 --> 05:29.460
that we didn't make
and do here.

05:29.460 --> 05:31.590
So this is a complete overhaul
on this thing.

05:31.590 --> 05:33.690
How long does that take?

05:33.700 --> 05:36.630
Believe it or not, we built
this car in about 30 days.

05:36.630 --> 05:38.430
So while we're taking a look
at the different cars,

05:38.430 --> 05:42.500
I'm asking richard how long
it took for the car to transform

05:42.500 --> 05:44.240
from when he got it
to the condition

05:44.240 --> 05:46.140
I'm looking at now,
which is finished,

05:46.140 --> 05:48.340
and he's kicking back,
you know, like 6 weeks,

05:48.340 --> 05:51.910
5 weeks, 6 weeks, all of which
fit into our time frame.

05:51.910 --> 05:53.610
Sounds kind of fun.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.650
Oh, it's a beast,
and it's a lot of fun.

05:55.650 --> 05:57.880
Attract a little attention
on Sunday afternoon.

05:57.890 --> 06:01.120
I'm an early ford guy,
so all my fords are real.

06:01.120 --> 06:03.260
That's a '32 three-window.
Nice.

06:03.260 --> 06:07.090
The quality of the cars around
here is, like, unsurpassed.

06:07.100 --> 06:09.260
I mean, these cars
really look like

06:09.260 --> 06:11.060
they just came off
the showroom floor,

06:11.070 --> 06:15.670
except I know they couldn't have
because none of them are stock.

06:15.670 --> 06:19.040
They all have this, I guess
you'd have to say this,

06:19.040 --> 06:21.340
gas monkey edge on them.

06:21.340 --> 06:24.180
These are 1967 firebirds.
Barry: Firebirds.

06:24.180 --> 06:27.210
But they're number one
and number two serial number.

06:27.220 --> 06:30.450
Barry:
And so many different cars,
different styles,

06:30.450 --> 06:34.190
classic cars,
sports cars, exotic cars.

06:34.190 --> 06:35.720
So as I'm showing him around,
he's like,

06:35.720 --> 06:37.020
"well, how fast
did you do this?"

06:37.030 --> 06:38.590
and "how long did this one
take you?"

06:38.590 --> 06:40.330
and, you know, "this looks
pretty quality.

06:40.330 --> 06:41.860
Is this how you do
all your builds?"

06:41.860 --> 06:44.460
etc and so forth, and I'm like,
"he's getting to something."

06:44.470 --> 06:45.530
so what
brings you out here?

06:45.530 --> 06:46.730
What are you
holding out on?

06:46.740 --> 06:48.570
Well, you know, first,
I wanted to be out,

06:48.570 --> 06:50.040
you know,
I just wanted to be around this

06:50.040 --> 06:53.210
and hear a little bit
about what you're doing.

06:53.210 --> 06:54.440
We're doing a show with hg.

06:54.440 --> 06:56.140
Russell:
Hgtv the tv channel?

06:56.150 --> 06:58.250
Yeah, we're redoing a house.
I got it.

06:58.250 --> 06:59.910
And it's, like,
awesome what they're doing.

06:59.920 --> 07:03.320
We're doing a big project
with all my "brady bunch"

07:03.320 --> 07:05.850
brothers and sisters
for hgtv called

07:05.850 --> 07:07.520
"a very brady renovation."

07:07.520 --> 07:08.760
oh, that's right.
So they're going in,

07:08.760 --> 07:11.220
and they are completely
dismantling this thing

07:11.230 --> 07:13.560
and reconforming it
and renovating it

07:13.560 --> 07:15.400
to look like the set
where we filmed...

07:15.400 --> 07:16.460
Super cool.

07:16.470 --> 07:17.600
...On the sound stage
in hollywood.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.370
Russell: Holy cow.
I cannot believe this.

07:19.370 --> 07:22.100
"the brady bunch" was one of my
favorite shows growing up,

07:22.100 --> 07:24.840
and now barry williams,
<i> the</i> greg brady,

07:24.840 --> 07:27.010
is here touring the shop
and he's telling us

07:27.010 --> 07:28.810
that they're renovating
the brady house?

07:28.810 --> 07:30.440
As a builder and the new guy
at the shop,

07:30.450 --> 07:31.750
this is beyond amazing.

07:31.750 --> 07:33.450
This is what I had in mind.

07:33.450 --> 07:35.820
When you think about it,
cars played an important role

07:35.820 --> 07:36.980
in the show.

07:36.990 --> 07:38.750
She's mine, all mine.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.320
[ hisses ]

07:41.320 --> 07:44.190
I was thinking the station wagon
because there were so many...

07:44.190 --> 07:45.230
The what?
The station wagon.

07:45.230 --> 07:46.590
There was...Well, listen.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.730
Hear me out.
Hear me out.

07:47.730 --> 07:49.360
It was the only thing
that could fit...

07:49.360 --> 07:51.630
Yeah.
...Everybody.

07:51.630 --> 07:54.940
I think the station wagon
really says brady.

07:54.940 --> 07:56.040
That's the one.

07:56.040 --> 07:59.040
That's the iconic car
of the time.

07:59.040 --> 08:01.910
Reconstruct
"the brady bunch" wagon...

08:01.910 --> 08:02.980
Alright.

08:02.980 --> 08:04.140
...Right, with gas monkey
attitude.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.980
Okay. That's the part
I was waiting on.

08:05.980 --> 08:07.480
Alright.
I love it.

08:07.480 --> 08:09.220
Now we're talking, you know,
creative license for gas monkey

08:09.220 --> 08:12.750
to do our version of the wagon
from "the brady bunch."

08:12.750 --> 08:14.720
I'm thinking, "what would've
been sitting there

08:14.720 --> 08:17.090
if mike brady
would've been really cool?"

08:17.090 --> 08:18.260
when is the house
supposed to be done?

08:18.260 --> 08:21.060
Thirty days. Thirty days.
[ laughs ]

08:21.060 --> 08:23.130
richard: So we have 30 days
to build the car?

08:23.130 --> 08:24.660
If you're not sure you can
handle it, you know,

08:24.670 --> 08:25.770
that's why...What I wanted
to talk to you about.

08:25.770 --> 08:26.830
Oh.
We can handle it.

08:26.840 --> 08:27.900
Alright.
Let's do it.

08:27.900 --> 08:29.370
Cool.
So this is pretty cool.

08:29.370 --> 08:31.470
I mean, I'm getting to be
involved with another network

08:31.470 --> 08:34.140
that's got a host
of celebrities in it,

08:34.140 --> 08:35.680
and they're doing something
that's iconic

08:35.680 --> 08:37.010
and from my childhood.

08:37.010 --> 08:38.980
I think it's going to be a cool
project to be a part of.

08:38.980 --> 08:40.480
I'm going to build
a "brady bunch" wagon.

08:40.480 --> 08:42.020
This is going to be silly.

08:42.020 --> 08:45.020
What I'm really worried about
right now is finding a wagon.

08:45.020 --> 08:46.950
"the brady bunch" wagon
was plymouth satellite,

08:46.960 --> 08:48.490
and there sure as hell
ain't a bunch of those

08:48.490 --> 08:50.860
laying around in garages
like old mustangs.

08:50.860 --> 08:52.030
Come on.

08:52.030 --> 08:53.690
Hey, what went on in that wagon,
anything good?

08:53.700 --> 08:54.930
Yeah, well...

08:54.930 --> 08:56.230
Tell me on the down time
there's a lot of stuff

08:56.230 --> 08:57.230
you guys did in there?
-...There are a few things.

08:57.230 --> 08:58.330
I don't want to make you
jealous.

08:58.330 --> 08:59.600
-Oh, you might.
But, you know, I mean,

08:59.600 --> 09:00.800
you know, marcia and I were
about the same age.

09:00.800 --> 09:09.110
â™ª

09:09.110 --> 09:10.510
hmm.

09:10.510 --> 09:12.550
That thing is rough.
Yeah.

09:12.550 --> 09:14.280
I hope it's not a build.

09:14.280 --> 09:15.750
What is this?

09:15.750 --> 09:17.250
'74 camaro
that richard had me

09:17.250 --> 09:18.920
go down to austin
and get in a hurry.

09:18.920 --> 09:21.050
Dude, it is awful.
[ laughs ]

09:21.060 --> 09:23.490
it's a peeler, like, horrible.

09:23.490 --> 09:25.390
He wants y'all to have it
running as quick as possible

09:25.390 --> 09:27.130
so he can sell it.
Well, there you go, folks.

09:27.130 --> 09:28.660
It looks like richard was able
to hunt down

09:28.660 --> 09:30.630
and retrieve another pos.

09:30.630 --> 09:32.070
This looks like
it got vomited out of

09:32.070 --> 09:33.730
"fast times at ridgemont high,"

09:33.740 --> 09:35.370
and it's got one foot
in the grave

09:35.370 --> 09:37.140
and another foot
on a banana peel.

09:37.140 --> 09:38.610
I hope we don't...
We're not painting it.

09:38.610 --> 09:39.770
Yeah, I hope so, too.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.110
No, he didn't say anything
about that.

09:41.110 --> 09:42.640
He just told me to tell y'all
to get it running.

09:42.640 --> 09:43.640
It's going to need
more than that.

09:43.650 --> 09:44.880
What about the doors and stuff?

09:44.880 --> 09:46.150
They're, like,
fricking falling off of it.

09:46.150 --> 09:48.650
Good god.

09:48.650 --> 09:49.850
He says it just needs
a battery

09:49.850 --> 09:51.520
and mess with it
a little bit and it's...

09:51.520 --> 09:53.220
It just needs a battery
and the doors aligned

09:53.220 --> 09:54.550
and the paint redone.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.520
And the motor rebuilt.
It's peeling on the hood.

09:56.530 --> 09:59.660
Allow me to translate the phrase
"needs a battery"

09:59.660 --> 10:01.090
and "get it running."

10:01.100 --> 10:04.860
that's richard speak for
let's open a giant can of worms.

10:04.870 --> 10:06.870
-Does it run?
-He says it does.

10:06.870 --> 10:08.370
-Pop it.
-Who says it does?

10:08.370 --> 10:09.700
The guy I bought it from.

10:09.710 --> 10:11.040
Coy: Where's the bottom piece?
It didn't have it.

10:11.040 --> 10:12.670
It's missing some pieces.

10:12.670 --> 10:14.110
It should have a hood
release in it.

10:14.110 --> 10:17.940
This is some straight up
"I painted it in my yard" stuff.

10:17.950 --> 10:20.250
Yup.
It looks as I thought it would.

10:20.250 --> 10:21.650
Mike, come on, man.

10:21.650 --> 10:23.420
You're supposed to tell me
when these things come in.

10:23.420 --> 10:24.650
I just saw it got here.

10:24.650 --> 10:26.420
Chill out, dude.
[bleep]

10:26.420 --> 10:27.890
dude, I'm supposed to be
shooting these things.

10:27.890 --> 10:29.360
I'm not...

10:29.360 --> 10:30.360
Richard is going to kill me if I
don't have this thing coming in.

10:30.360 --> 10:31.560
Well, then you need
to pay attention

10:31.560 --> 10:32.730
because I'm not doing
your job for you.

10:32.730 --> 10:34.560
So after a fresh diaper change
and a juice box,

10:34.560 --> 10:36.960
sinjin busts out the door
to get some snaps

10:36.970 --> 10:39.830
of our '74 camaro
then get them to richard

10:39.840 --> 10:42.070
so richard can get it up
on the old interwebs.

10:42.070 --> 10:45.240
It's kind of how sinjin makes
himself useful here at the shop.

10:45.240 --> 10:46.740
Why don't you
help us get it off

10:46.740 --> 10:48.110
and then you can
take your photos?

10:48.110 --> 10:50.140
Because photos on a trailer
are going to look stupid.

10:50.150 --> 10:51.540
What is this anyway?

10:51.550 --> 10:54.050
It looks kind of rusty
and kind of beat up.

10:54.050 --> 10:55.820
If you don't know what kind
of car that is,

10:55.820 --> 10:58.180
then maybe you shouldn't
be working here.

10:58.190 --> 10:59.690
Well, how...
Well, maybe

10:59.690 --> 11:01.660
I'm just testing you to see
if you know what car this is.

11:01.660 --> 11:03.060
I'm right here.
Why are you yelling at me?

11:03.060 --> 11:04.520
Calm down, okay?

11:04.530 --> 11:06.060
Help us get it unloaded.

11:06.060 --> 11:07.490
Get the front straps.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.430
We'll get it off, and you
can get your pictures, okay?

11:09.430 --> 11:11.000
But then after photos,
right?

11:11.000 --> 11:12.100
You can make stepdaddy happy.

11:12.100 --> 11:13.430
This isn't even my job.

11:13.440 --> 11:15.470
It is your job.

11:15.470 --> 11:17.640
Rookies -- it's not that they
don't know what they're doing.

11:17.640 --> 11:21.240
It's just they don't know
when to shut the hell up.

11:21.240 --> 11:23.110
Climb in.
Does this thing have brakes?!

11:23.110 --> 11:24.580
We'll find out.
Of course it has brakes.

11:24.580 --> 11:25.610
Mater, does this have brakes?

11:25.610 --> 11:27.350
We just don't know
if they work.

11:27.350 --> 11:28.650
A/c?
Here's what we're going to do.

11:28.650 --> 11:31.250
Just give it a good solid
push off.

11:31.250 --> 11:32.490
What if it doesn't
have brakes?

11:32.490 --> 11:33.820
I don't know.
Alright.

11:33.820 --> 11:36.990
Are we going to hurt it?
I guess...No, not really.

11:36.990 --> 11:38.590
Richard has run
into the building before.

11:38.590 --> 11:41.060
All right.
Straight back.

11:41.060 --> 11:42.500
-Oh, got brakes?
-Does it have brakes?

11:42.500 --> 11:43.730
I think.
It's...Aah!

11:43.730 --> 11:46.300
Better check!

11:46.300 --> 11:48.070
-Yes, it does have brakes.
-Thank god it had brakes.

11:48.070 --> 11:49.900
Coy: It would've been funnier
if it didn't.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.500
Let us know when you're done.

11:51.510 --> 11:57.680
â™ª

11:57.680 --> 11:58.910
russell:
Oh, love the snow.

11:58.910 --> 12:01.250
It's like being home.
This is crazy.

12:01.250 --> 12:02.880
Richard: Look at this as far
as you can see.

12:02.880 --> 12:04.280
I'm just going through
the stop sign like this.

12:04.290 --> 12:05.520
What stop sign?
Yeah.

12:05.520 --> 12:07.590
Wee!
[ laughs ]

12:07.590 --> 12:10.560
there's literally
nothing out here.

12:10.560 --> 12:12.630
Richard:
Russell and I are braving
the frozen tundra of iowa

12:12.630 --> 12:15.460
to check out a 1969
plymouth satellite wagon.

12:15.460 --> 12:18.400
It took 3 days to locate it,
and the clock has been ticking.

12:18.400 --> 12:21.800
This guy out here
in iowa has one.

12:21.800 --> 12:24.170
It's not exactly like
"the brady bunch" wagon, though.

12:24.170 --> 12:25.440
Right.
It's the wrong color.

12:25.440 --> 12:28.070
Okay.
And it has wood paneling.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.740
The original one was brown,
no wood paneling, right?

12:30.750 --> 12:33.780
So my problem is there's
no other car out there.

12:33.780 --> 12:34.810
There's not one.

12:34.820 --> 12:36.920
Hence whey
we're in this oasis.

12:36.920 --> 12:38.490
Yes.
So "the brady bunch"

12:38.490 --> 12:40.520
had a plymouth satellite
station wagon.

12:40.520 --> 12:43.620
Pretty much every single year
it was a little different,

12:43.630 --> 12:47.030
and this one
is the most iconic.

12:47.030 --> 12:48.860
One of the ultimate
grocery grabbers of all time

12:48.860 --> 12:50.330
is the plymouth satellite wagon.

12:50.330 --> 12:51.530
The satellite wagon cam
e with either

12:51.530 --> 12:55.300
a two-barrel 318 v8
or the four-barrel 383.

12:55.300 --> 12:56.670
It could even seat up
to nine people,

12:56.670 --> 12:58.440
which means it could
fit all eight bradys,

12:58.440 --> 13:00.710
alice the housekeeper,
and the dog, tiger.

13:00.710 --> 13:01.810
[ dog barks ]

13:01.810 --> 13:03.540
well, this is it.
So this guy has got one.

13:03.550 --> 13:05.010
He says it's good.

13:05.010 --> 13:07.350
Yeah, he showed me pictures,
and we're going to get up here.

13:07.350 --> 13:08.650
Whoo!

13:08.650 --> 13:11.520
-Hey, what's going on, guys?
-Hey. Welcome to iowa.

13:11.520 --> 13:13.290
Right on.

13:13.290 --> 13:14.620
-Is it...
-Mike.

13:14.620 --> 13:15.960
-Mike and mike, huh?
-Russell.
-Mike and mike.

13:15.960 --> 13:17.320
My name is mike hill.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.190
This is my father-in-law
mike winger.

13:19.190 --> 13:21.560
We're from green county, iowa,
where it's nice and cold.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.730
Winger:
Let's take old richard in
and go look at this old

13:23.730 --> 13:25.570
plymouth real quick.

13:25.570 --> 13:26.630
Russell:
This is where it is, huh?

13:26.640 --> 13:29.240
Nicest satellite wagon
you ever did see.

13:29.240 --> 13:30.540
There it is.

13:30.540 --> 13:32.170
[ engine revs, tires squeal ]

Coming up on "fast n' loud"...

13:34.110 --> 13:35.610
Nineteen thousand dollars?

13:35.610 --> 13:38.910
...Richard tries not to get
skinned on a '69 satellite...

13:38.910 --> 13:40.650
There's got to be another one
out there somewhere.

13:40.650 --> 13:41.880
Yeah, you think so?

13:41.880 --> 13:43.050
...And...

13:43.050 --> 13:44.350
Coy: I don't know how good
our brakes are.

13:44.350 --> 13:45.850
That's probably not good
to figure out now.

13:45.850 --> 13:48.960
.. The monkeys peel out
in the '74 camaro.

13:48.960 --> 13:50.320
Man: Yeah!
[ ties squeal ]

13:58.730 --> 14:01.030
-what's up?
-Hey. Welcome to iowa.

14:01.040 --> 14:02.970
Richard:
Russell and I are out here
in freezing-cold iowa

14:02.970 --> 14:06.310
to see about buying a 1969
plymouth satellite wagon,

14:06.310 --> 14:08.270
also known
as "the brady bunch" wagon.

14:08.280 --> 14:10.680
We're building one as part
of hgtv's big renovation

14:10.680 --> 14:13.210
of the original
"brady bunch" house.

14:13.220 --> 14:14.350
Russell:
This is where it is, huh?

14:14.350 --> 14:17.020
Nicest satellite wagon
you ever did see.

14:17.020 --> 14:19.420
-There it is.
-Oh.
-There it is.

14:19.420 --> 14:22.260
-Awesome.
-[ laughing ] that is awesome.

14:22.260 --> 14:24.620
Winger: What is it,
19,000 original miles?

14:24.630 --> 14:26.790
-Yup.
-What?
-Come on.

14:26.800 --> 14:28.730
Richard: This wagon is
absolutely amazing.

14:28.730 --> 14:30.130
It is a time capsule.

14:30.130 --> 14:33.800
It really is 19,000 original
miles, really is original paint.

14:33.800 --> 14:35.200
This is rad.

14:35.200 --> 14:38.170
It's everything he said it was.
What's the story?

14:38.170 --> 14:40.510
I mean, how do you find
something like this up here?

14:40.510 --> 14:42.540
Hill:
I found it on a internet group,

14:42.540 --> 14:45.350
and I bought it to take my wife
and two boys on road trips.

14:45.350 --> 14:47.050
What motor is under here?
Three-eighteen.

14:47.050 --> 14:48.920
-Wow.
-Oh, it's impressive.

14:48.920 --> 14:51.150
It's got power steering,
manual brakes.

14:51.150 --> 14:52.520
Well, that's pretty rad, man.

14:52.520 --> 14:54.690
What's the deal with
that though?

14:54.690 --> 14:56.460
Hill:
That is a family car.

14:56.460 --> 15:00.130
My uncle that passed away last
year from a heart attack...

15:00.130 --> 15:02.960
He built that car here
with my pops.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.360
-Wow.
-I'm selling the plymouth

15:04.370 --> 15:08.470
because I want to keep
my uncle's car in the family,

15:08.470 --> 15:11.870
and this actually allows me
to take that money

15:11.870 --> 15:16.510
and put towards his '57 chevy
that he built with my pops here.

15:16.510 --> 15:17.910
Well, can we
take it for a ride?

15:17.910 --> 15:20.710
Hell yeah.
Alright. Let's do it.

15:20.720 --> 15:23.980
Russell: Are we there yet?

pull this car over, kids.

15:25.790 --> 15:27.550

15:27.560 --> 15:30.290

this thing will go.

15:30.290 --> 15:31.560
Richard:
In any normal car deal,

15:31.560 --> 15:33.730
I might pay $8,000
for a cherry wagon like this.

with the original brown color.

of their brown

with the brown paint

glossy version.

21:38.890 --> 21:40.590
was another staple color
in the '70s,

21:40.600 --> 21:42.600

and keep it the same color

21:42.600 --> 21:44.230

another 15 grand to build it,

21:49.870 --> 21:52.610

I don't think I've seen a model
from that year look

23:44.250 --> 23:47.190
that good since that year.
[ laughs ]

23:47.190 --> 23:49.050
and that's, like,
more than 40 years ago.

23:49.060 --> 23:51.690
Russell: What do you think?
Are you surprised he found it?

23:51.690 --> 23:53.830
I am blown away, blown away.
Hey, man.

23:53.830 --> 23:54.790
Good to meet you.
Good to meet you.

23:54.800 --> 23:56.130
Coy:
Bring back memories or what?

23:56.130 --> 23:59.370
Yeah, it...I would say just,
like, a flood of them.

23:59.370 --> 24:00.830
Yeah.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.200
Well, let's talk about what
can make this thing special.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.370
I'm thinking, you know,
get it down a little bit,

24:04.370 --> 24:06.640
give it a little attitude,
and I was thinking of maybe '70s

24:06.640 --> 24:08.110
side pipes.
That would be awesome.

24:08.110 --> 24:09.640
Russell: Great idea.
I mean really.

24:09.640 --> 24:11.180
So that means new tires
and new wheels?

24:11.180 --> 24:12.910
Oh, new tires, new wheels,
new suspension.

24:12.910 --> 24:14.250
New suspension, yeah.

24:14.250 --> 24:16.120
We're trying to go
as authentically as we can,

24:16.120 --> 24:19.390
so, like, the third-row seat,
that would be awesome.

24:19.390 --> 24:21.590
I mean, six kids.

24:21.590 --> 24:24.120
Barry wants a third-row seat.
I get it. I know why.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.390
There were six kids in there,
but he has no idea how hard

24:26.390 --> 24:28.260
it was to find the wagon
in the first place.

24:28.260 --> 24:29.530
Is it hard
to find the seats?

24:29.530 --> 24:31.660
I think it's going to be damn
near impossible.

24:31.670 --> 24:34.870
Alright. Well, that would
kind of make it.

24:34.870 --> 24:37.770
I have every confidence he'll be
able to pull that off though,

24:37.770 --> 24:40.110
and that'll kind of really
put it over the top.

24:40.110 --> 24:41.310
Can we take it for a spin?

24:41.310 --> 24:42.510
Oh, I got a better idea.

24:42.510 --> 24:43.940
Let me show you something.
Alright.

24:43.950 --> 24:46.010
With a satellite and cones
and an egg,

24:46.010 --> 24:47.980
I recreated the obstacle course
from that iconic

24:47.980 --> 24:49.780
"brady bunch" episode
where marcia and greg

24:49.780 --> 24:51.650
see which one
is the best driver.

24:51.650 --> 24:54.090
Spoiler alert: Marcia won.

24:54.090 --> 24:55.750
This time it's going to be
between me and greg,

24:55.760 --> 24:57.790
I mean barry.

24:57.790 --> 24:59.160
Before barry arrived,
I had the monkeys

24:59.160 --> 25:01.460
set up a bunch of cones
to form a course.

25:01.460 --> 25:03.360
Barry and I will each take
a turn in the '69

25:03.360 --> 25:04.700
plymouth driving
through the course

25:04.700 --> 25:06.600
and finally stopping
with the car

25:06.600 --> 25:08.370
closest to the cone
with an egg on it.

25:08.370 --> 25:11.400
Anyone who knocks the egg
of the cone is a loser.

25:11.410 --> 25:13.610
Well, I think I get to go first
since you've done this before

25:13.610 --> 25:14.870
and you've been practicing.

25:14.880 --> 25:16.780
Oh, listen, you can go first.
You can go second.

25:16.780 --> 25:19.580
Just know yourself out wherever
you're comfortable, richard.

25:19.580 --> 25:22.150
-I'm doing it.
-Wow. He is confident!

25:22.150 --> 25:24.620
Let's see your stuff.
I'll beat you easy.

25:24.620 --> 25:26.250
Okay, we've got a bet.

25:28.790 --> 25:30.290
Well, here it goes.

25:30.290 --> 25:32.060
-All right.
-Whoo.

25:32.060 --> 25:33.260
Come on, no hitting cones.

25:33.260 --> 25:34.930
-I see he's being a slow roller.
-He missed.

25:34.930 --> 25:36.100
-What's he doing?
-He missed his calling.

25:36.100 --> 25:37.660
He was definitely
a soccer dad.

25:37.670 --> 25:39.600
Man:
Come on, marcia, I mean richard.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.400
Richard: I got to win.
I got to beat greg.

25:41.400 --> 25:42.900
Damn it, I mean barry.
Oh, man.

25:42.900 --> 25:44.640
So let's just hope he remembers
where the brake is.

25:44.640 --> 25:45.740
Come on.
You can do it.

25:45.740 --> 25:46.940
Here we go.
Oh, take your sweet time.

25:46.940 --> 25:51.680
There we go.

25:57.650 --> 25:58.980
-No.
-Oh. Oh!

25:58.990 --> 26:02.120
-There it is.
-Is that it?

26:02.120 --> 26:03.190
-Let's see.
-Oh.

26:03.190 --> 26:04.560
-Bring it out.
-Is the cone touching?

26:04.560 --> 26:07.560
You are 7 inches
to the center of the cone.

26:07.560 --> 26:11.060
My turn.
Showboat, showboat, showboat.

26:11.070 --> 26:14.370
It's not about your style
in this kind of competition.

26:14.370 --> 26:18.070
It's all about how close you get
to the cone

26:18.070 --> 26:21.810
without knocking the egg off.

26:21.810 --> 26:22.880
-Oh, here it is.
-There he goes.

26:22.880 --> 26:23.880
My god,
it's like a flag fender.

26:23.880 --> 26:24.940
Man:
Dude, it's like he owns it.

26:24.950 --> 26:27.010
It's like my childhood
flashback.

26:27.010 --> 26:29.550
-Oh. Oh, oh!
-Dude.

26:29.550 --> 26:30.920
-Look at it!
-He's too calm with it.

26:30.920 --> 26:32.650
Oh, this is the tricky
turn here.

26:32.650 --> 26:34.350
Barry: I'm trying to stay
cool under pressure.

26:34.360 --> 26:37.460
It takes about 2 1/2 turns
just to get it to tip

26:37.460 --> 26:39.960
around to one direction
or the other.

26:39.960 --> 26:41.490
-Come on.
-Nice move.
-Here we go. Here we go.

26:41.500 --> 26:42.700
-He's got it.
-Do it.

26:42.700 --> 26:43.960
-Right at it now.
-He's got it now.

26:43.970 --> 26:45.130
-Oh, he is confident.
-He's going to land it.

26:45.130 --> 26:46.470
He's got it.
He's got it.

26:46.470 --> 26:47.630
Oh, yeah.

26:47.640 --> 26:49.070
-He's got it.
-Oh, oh, oh.

26:49.070 --> 26:50.500
-Perfect.
-Oh!

26:50.500 --> 26:53.940
[ laughter ]

26:53.940 --> 26:55.840
-not bad. Not bad.
-Look.

26:55.840 --> 27:01.550
-Yup!
-What a way to redeem yourself.

27:01.550 --> 27:02.650
You win, sir.

27:02.650 --> 27:04.050
-It was close.
-That's pretty good.

27:04.050 --> 27:05.950
Barry:
It's not whether or not you
hit the cone.

27:05.950 --> 27:08.590
It's whether or not the egg
comes off the cone.

27:08.590 --> 27:09.790
Man, that is great.

27:09.790 --> 27:11.490
-You totally redeemed...
-Oh!

27:11.490 --> 27:15.690
[ laughter ]

27:15.700 --> 27:17.400
that's it, man.

27:17.400 --> 27:20.500
I'm never gambling
with a brady again.

27:20.500 --> 27:22.770
I feel I did pretty good,
and I put on a better show

27:22.770 --> 27:24.740
than barry,
but at the end of the day,

27:24.740 --> 27:26.470
he cheated,
and I still don't know

27:26.470 --> 27:28.470
how or when
he stuck the egg to the cone.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.580
I was with him the whole
damn time he was here.

27:30.580 --> 27:32.780
-Well done.
-No problem.

27:32.780 --> 27:34.310
You just got brady'ed.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.980
Yeah, I might've given barry

27:35.980 --> 27:39.080
a little bit of help
with that obstacle course.

27:39.090 --> 27:40.350
While richard was putting
the plymouth

27:40.350 --> 27:42.190
back in the garage
after his turn,

27:42.190 --> 27:44.190
I might have slipped him
a little super glue,

27:44.190 --> 27:46.390
and he pulled the switcheroo
just like

27:46.390 --> 27:49.330
"the brady bunch" producers
did with actor gene hackman

27:49.330 --> 27:52.500
who was originally cast
to play mike brady,

27:52.500 --> 27:54.600
but let's just keep
that between us.

27:54.600 --> 27:56.100
-Well done, sir.
-Oh, thanks.

27:56.100 --> 27:57.870
Well done.

27:57.870 --> 28:07.850
â™ª

28:07.850 --> 28:09.820
-is he really that short?
-Yeah.

28:09.820 --> 28:11.520
-Oh, there he goes.
-That's good.

28:11.520 --> 28:13.150
-I stole my dad's station wagon.

28:13.150 --> 28:14.620
Josh: Right now, we're going
to tear down the '69

28:14.620 --> 28:16.820
plymouth brady
station wagon.

28:16.820 --> 28:19.290
We're building it as part
of hgtv's big renovation

28:19.290 --> 28:21.890
of the original "brady bunch"
house from the tv series.

28:21.900 --> 28:23.130
Even though we're going
to build it to look

28:23.130 --> 28:25.000
like the original
"brady bunch" station wagon,

28:25.000 --> 28:28.300
we're going to give it
that gas monkey spin.

28:28.300 --> 28:31.270
Man: All right.
Let's do it.

28:31.270 --> 28:33.240
This wagon is in
near-perfect shape,

28:33.240 --> 28:34.510
so we don't need
to nuke the car

28:34.510 --> 28:37.110
the way we usually do
during a typical teardown.

28:37.110 --> 28:38.740
Let's fence.

28:42.220 --> 28:47.090
-Geez.
-Hmm.

28:47.090 --> 28:49.120
What is this?

28:49.120 --> 28:51.460
Hmm.

28:51.460 --> 28:53.960
Keenan: I found this awesome
tiki-like necklace thing.

28:53.960 --> 28:55.890
I think I'm going to hang it
around the shop

28:55.900 --> 29:00.070
for a good-luck charm.

29:00.070 --> 29:01.900
Some good-luck charm.

29:06.410 --> 29:08.170
Keenan: I'm keeping this.
[ slams car door ]

29:08.180 --> 29:10.780
god dang it.
Screwdriver slipped.

29:15.020 --> 29:16.150
Man: What did you do?

29:16.150 --> 29:17.820
Man #2: I need a new set
of spark plug wires.

29:17.820 --> 29:20.190
Man #3:
That's the second spark plug
that I've ripped in half today.

29:20.190 --> 29:23.920
Coy:
Things were humming along pretty
smoothly during the teardown.

29:23.920 --> 29:26.730
Then all of a sudden a lot of
goofy things started to happen.

29:26.730 --> 29:27.960
[ clatter, crash ]

29:27.960 --> 29:29.260
that sounded bad.

29:29.260 --> 29:30.860
But I'm sure there's
a perfectly logical

29:30.870 --> 29:32.230
explanation for all of it.

29:32.230 --> 29:34.670
-You guys ready?
-Yeah.

29:34.670 --> 29:36.500
Let's get the bugs out here.
You know what I'm saying?

29:36.500 --> 29:37.770
We'll just see how the rest
of it goes

29:37.770 --> 29:39.400
with the car up in the air.

29:43.910 --> 29:45.440
-This is a great idea.
-The mess was already there.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.710
We have a pan right there.

29:47.720 --> 29:49.680
Thanks, mike,
for the extra hand.

29:49.680 --> 29:51.750
-I'm not getting dirty.
-Sons of bitches.

29:51.750 --> 29:52.890
Alright.
Let's bring it down.

29:52.890 --> 29:54.590
Everything went all right
under the car,

29:54.590 --> 29:55.990
so all three of those
bad things

29:55.990 --> 29:58.860
that happened in a row
were purely coincidental.

29:58.860 --> 30:00.930
Anyway, now we'll bring down
the car,

30:00.930 --> 30:02.860
and we'll pull the motor
and transmission.

30:02.860 --> 30:06.130
-Good, do it to it.
-This thing it sketchy, dude.

30:06.130 --> 30:07.330
-Yeah, well.
-Yeah, it's sketchy.

30:07.330 --> 30:08.800
Yeah, this is
definitely sketchy.

30:08.800 --> 30:09.970
If you hit something, we're
going to lose that motor so...

30:09.970 --> 30:11.200
Man: Yep.

30:11.210 --> 30:12.200
Let's get this car
over to paint.

30:12.210 --> 30:13.610
Coy: That was pretty hairy.

30:13.610 --> 30:16.240
I'd even go as far as to saying
it was as bad

30:16.240 --> 30:19.140
as getting a back
injury while hula dancing.

30:19.150 --> 30:20.380
Help!

30:20.380 --> 30:21.950
Or, I don't know,
like finding a tarantula

30:21.950 --> 30:25.280
that doesn't even live in hawaii
crawling on your chest.

30:25.290 --> 30:28.090
Try not to flinch.

30:28.090 --> 30:30.420
Anyway, we'll get the plymouth
to the body shop side,

30:30.420 --> 30:32.260
where tony, keke,
and I can go ahead

30:32.260 --> 30:33.630
and get it prepped for paint.

30:33.630 --> 30:34.890
Hey, every time you move
the wheel,

30:34.900 --> 30:36.330
just so you know,
you got a little steerage.

30:36.330 --> 30:37.530
I'm dumping power steering.

30:37.530 --> 30:39.260
Well, I can't be having
that grease on my side.

30:39.270 --> 30:41.300
[ engine revs, tires squeal ]
whoo!

30:41.300 --> 30:42.900
Narrator:
Coming up on "fast n' loud"...

30:42.900 --> 30:43.970
I'm getting lucky.

30:43.970 --> 30:46.410
The monkeys stretch
their patience.

30:46.410 --> 30:48.270
-Maybe not.
-And...

30:48.280 --> 30:49.410
I do like those shoes.

30:49.410 --> 30:51.440
Narrator: Richard offers
a slippery trade.

30:51.450 --> 30:55.880
I want all the money
in your pocket and the van.

30:55.880 --> 30:57.650
[ laughter ]

31:08.600 --> 31:09.900
the side paneling is all vinyl?

31:09.900 --> 31:11.200
It is.
Oh.

31:11.200 --> 31:12.730
Coy: So right now,
me and the paint and body crew,

31:12.730 --> 31:15.000
we're going to start
prepping the '69 plymouth

31:15.000 --> 31:16.940
"brady bunch"
wagon for paint.

31:16.940 --> 31:19.240
Time is running out
to get it ready for hgtv's

31:19.240 --> 31:21.840
"brady bunch" house
renovation reveal,

31:21.840 --> 31:23.480
so we better get to moving.

31:23.480 --> 31:25.080
I just see a lot of taping
in our future.

31:25.080 --> 31:26.550
It's going to be
a lot of taping,

31:26.550 --> 31:28.280
but at least it's not going
to be a lot of put it together,

31:28.280 --> 31:29.950
take it apart,
put it together, take it apart.

31:29.950 --> 31:31.820
Richard bought the plymouth
for 15 grand,

31:31.820 --> 31:33.620
and he's given us
a budget of 15 grand.

31:33.620 --> 31:35.550
So that's all-in at $30,000.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.790
As steep as that sounds,
richard figures

31:37.790 --> 31:39.590
that the exposure
that gas monkey will get

31:39.590 --> 31:41.830
on hgtv,
it's worth it.

31:41.830 --> 31:43.060
There's a woodgrain decal

31:43.060 --> 31:45.230
that wraps around
the entire boat of the car.

31:45.230 --> 31:46.600
I'm getting lucky.

31:46.600 --> 31:47.930
Tony and keenan are going
to start putting a heat gun

31:47.940 --> 31:49.570
to the fenders.

31:49.570 --> 31:50.700
Maybe not.

31:50.700 --> 31:53.610
And I have a genius plan
for the rest of the car.

31:53.610 --> 31:54.970
Coy: Let's try rolling it
in the paint booth

31:54.980 --> 31:56.440
and putting it on bake.

31:56.440 --> 31:58.910
Stripping vinyl off the side
of a car is worse than removing

31:58.910 --> 32:00.650
a price sticker
from the sole of your shoe.

32:00.650 --> 32:02.750
Anybody got a roast,
want to make a roast?

32:02.750 --> 32:05.150
But here's what can make it
easier, some heat.

32:05.150 --> 32:08.120
The paint booth can be heated
as high as 160 degrees.

32:08.120 --> 32:10.220
I can't think of a better way
to spend

32:10.220 --> 32:15.390
the afternoon than peeling vinyl
in a hot bright box.

32:15.400 --> 32:16.760
Did I mention it was hot?

32:16.760 --> 32:19.300
It's hotter than the doghouse
on the "brady bunch" set,

32:19.300 --> 32:27.110
where bobby and cindy brady
used to hang out and smooch.

32:27.110 --> 32:28.210
Why don't y'all come help me?

32:28.210 --> 32:31.140
Tony: Hell no,
look at yourself.

32:31.150 --> 32:32.540
-It's hot in there.
-You think?

32:32.550 --> 32:33.750
But it's coming off
really quick.

32:33.750 --> 32:35.150
-I'm sure it is, but...
-It'd be nice to...

32:35.150 --> 32:36.250
You see how small
this body is?

32:36.250 --> 32:37.450
Come off a lot quic--

32:37.450 --> 32:38.550
you see how little
he is?

32:38.550 --> 32:40.850
-Yeah.
-We'll disappear.

32:40.850 --> 32:42.120
Coy:
Just in case you were worried

32:42.120 --> 32:43.690
that we weren't having
enough fun,

32:43.690 --> 32:46.760
now we have to weld up all the
holes from the chrome trim.

32:46.760 --> 32:47.930
We only pulled the side trim.

32:47.930 --> 32:49.430
The rest of the trim is staying.

32:49.430 --> 32:52.800
I know I counted 54
just on this one side.

32:52.800 --> 32:54.770
Did you count the fenders?
I haven't counted the fenders.

32:54.770 --> 32:57.570
We got about 120, at least.
Yeah.

32:57.570 --> 33:01.170
I did some quick math, and if
each hole takes 10 minutes,

33:01.180 --> 33:02.810
that's 20 man-hours.

33:02.810 --> 33:04.040
Go get them, guys.

33:04.040 --> 33:06.850
I'll be in my executive office.
[ sighs ]

33:06.850 --> 33:08.380
I need to do a spray-out
to show richard

33:08.380 --> 33:10.750
which color we're going to
go with to paint the wagon.

33:10.750 --> 33:12.420
That's way too dark.
Here we go.

33:12.420 --> 33:15.020
I think that's pretty close
to the original,

33:15.020 --> 33:18.690
but it just doesn't have
any kind of glow to it.

33:18.690 --> 33:24.660
I like this because it's got
a little bit more gold, g1423.

33:24.670 --> 33:30.170
G, one, four, two,
three, what the heck?

33:30.170 --> 33:31.540
Are you freaking kidding me?

33:31.540 --> 33:34.570
There are no formulas available
in this series.

33:34.580 --> 33:35.910
[bleep]

33:35.910 --> 33:37.910
I'm going to try
a different color.

33:37.910 --> 33:39.910
That's never happened before.

33:39.910 --> 33:42.110
I guess there was a first time
for everything.

33:42.120 --> 33:43.750
Oh, that's weird.

33:48.190 --> 33:49.790
I'm going to try this.
Maybe this will pull it.

33:49.790 --> 33:52.160
It's called juke.
Keenan: I like it.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.730
It's a chrysler.
Hmm.

33:53.730 --> 33:55.460
Which guess what?

33:55.460 --> 33:58.500
That is also a chrysler.

33:58.500 --> 33:59.770
Money in the bank.

33:59.770 --> 34:03.200
Bloop, bloop.

34:03.200 --> 34:04.770
Ah, nah.

34:04.770 --> 34:11.310
â™ª

34:11.310 --> 34:13.050
whoa!

34:13.050 --> 34:14.080
Almost screwed up.

34:14.080 --> 34:15.250
Coy:
Probably shouldn't press my luck

34:15.250 --> 34:17.620
with the way things
are going on this build.

34:17.620 --> 34:20.520
After all, I still need richard
to sign off on this color.

34:22.590 --> 34:25.260
Oh, yeah, it's a lot
different out here.

34:25.260 --> 34:28.060
I think that's close to the
milky brown it was,

34:28.060 --> 34:29.630
but it's got
some attitude to it.

34:29.630 --> 34:30.760
Right.

34:30.760 --> 34:31.900
And then we throw
some flat black to it.

34:31.900 --> 34:33.230
Yeah, to give it
a little more attitude.

34:33.230 --> 34:35.270
I like the pearl in it.
Well, keke likes it.

34:35.270 --> 34:36.370
[bleep] we're done.
Here you go, man.

34:36.370 --> 34:37.570
All right.
Good deal.

34:37.570 --> 34:39.070
Why don't you like
all of the ones first?

34:39.070 --> 34:41.440
I do, or I can from now on,
if you want me to.

34:41.440 --> 34:51.350
â™ª

34:51.350 --> 34:54.190
dude, what's up?

34:54.190 --> 34:56.350
Oh, not much, just finishing
the monkey yard.

34:56.360 --> 34:58.090
Richard:
I'll pulling up to work today
and I catch my old buddy

34:58.090 --> 34:59.220
steve mabry.

34:59.230 --> 35:00.960
Now steve has been doing
some artistic metal work

35:00.960 --> 35:03.960
to dazzle up the merch shop
and the monkey yard hangup area.

35:03.960 --> 35:05.130
It's looking good.

35:05.130 --> 35:07.630
When is the monkey yard
going to be finished?

35:07.630 --> 35:09.770
By your birthday.
My name is steve mabry.

35:09.770 --> 35:11.140
I'm from dallas, texas.

35:11.140 --> 35:13.000
I own the rusty buffalo company.

35:13.010 --> 35:14.740
Come on, man,
I want to party out here.

35:14.740 --> 35:15.940
No, it'll be done...

35:15.940 --> 35:17.210
I want people to be able to come
through the shop

35:17.210 --> 35:18.610
and see inside and...

35:18.610 --> 35:20.310
End of the month
we'll be done, promise.

35:20.310 --> 35:21.550
What's up with the van.

35:21.550 --> 35:23.520
I've had that a long time.
That's rad.

35:23.520 --> 35:27.090
I've got this old van
that I stripped down and rusted.

35:27.090 --> 35:28.820
What's the deal with it?

35:28.820 --> 35:30.320
Nothing, just an extra
work truck.

35:30.320 --> 35:31.690
It's for sale,
if you want to buy it.

35:31.690 --> 35:33.460
How much is this $500 van?

35:33.460 --> 35:36.360
Well, add one more zero,
5 grand.

35:36.360 --> 35:38.560
Five thousand dollars?
Come on.

35:38.570 --> 35:40.200
Here lately, I've been on
a little bit of a van kick

35:40.200 --> 35:44.600
because I think they're kind of
coming back popular again.

35:44.610 --> 35:46.640
We've seen a bunch of cool vans
come through the garage,

35:46.640 --> 35:49.170
the '67 ford falcon van
that was the first in line

35:49.180 --> 35:53.080
at indianapolis for 37 years,

35:53.080 --> 35:55.750
then one dusty
'72 ford econoline shorty.

35:55.750 --> 35:58.150
Man: This is going to be
a bad idea.

35:58.150 --> 36:00.620
And there's nothing cooler
than the '76 chevy g10

36:00.620 --> 36:04.460
we turned into the gas monkey
tequila adventure van.

36:04.460 --> 36:06.890
You got some rugs in there,
ties the whole van together.

36:06.890 --> 36:09.160
You got jesus
on the dashboard.

36:09.160 --> 36:10.360
You always got to have
one of those.

36:10.360 --> 36:12.030
Steve's the most
eccentric dude I know,

36:12.030 --> 36:14.800
and these vans are in
high demand for people like him.

36:14.800 --> 36:16.900
Let's go for a ride.
I'm driving.

36:16.900 --> 36:18.300
It's a little finicky.

36:18.310 --> 36:19.700
Okay, you're driving.

36:19.710 --> 36:23.740
I mean, you can't ever go wrong
with one of these vans.

36:23.740 --> 36:26.040
Richard: Just don't hit my car.
Steve: All right.

36:26.050 --> 36:27.280
The van actually drove
pretty well.

36:27.280 --> 36:28.410
I was impressed.

36:28.420 --> 36:29.920
Hold on.

36:29.920 --> 36:32.050
It's a little noisy.
I didn't hear you.

36:32.050 --> 36:33.520
What did you say?
Yeah, I know, right?

36:33.520 --> 36:36.350
This one's
a early '70s short bed ford.

36:36.360 --> 36:38.620
I didn't expect to be making
an offer on a rusty van today,

36:38.630 --> 36:41.390
but shorty vans, well, they're
awesome little money makers,

36:41.400 --> 36:43.160
if you can get it
for the right price.

36:43.160 --> 36:45.130
All right.
So how much do you want for it?

36:45.130 --> 36:46.500
I'd take $4,000 for it.

36:46.500 --> 36:47.630
No, there ain't no way, dude.

36:47.630 --> 36:49.230
What do you mean, no way?

36:49.240 --> 36:51.000
I almost paid that
for these shoes.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.940
I ain't going to pay that
for this crappy van.

36:53.940 --> 36:55.470
I do like those shoes.

36:56.880 --> 36:59.440
I love richard's shoes
that he's wearing today.

36:59.450 --> 37:02.280
They're sasquatch fur,
I'm pretty sure.

37:02.280 --> 37:03.620
I like those shoes.

37:03.620 --> 37:05.250
They're freaking cool, man.
I need those shoes.

37:05.250 --> 37:07.120
They go with my sweater.

37:07.120 --> 37:09.990
I would have to agree, sir,
but you can't afford the shoes.

37:09.990 --> 37:11.160
Richard:
Steve is a little out there,

37:11.160 --> 37:13.260
but this is on a whole
new level with my shoes,

37:13.260 --> 37:16.330
and I'm thinking I could
use this to my advantage.

37:16.330 --> 37:17.430
What do you want for those?

37:17.430 --> 37:19.460
I don't want to sell them.

37:19.470 --> 37:21.200
They're really kind of
one of a kind.

37:21.200 --> 37:22.630
Trade you for the van.

37:22.640 --> 37:25.500
Did I just hear him say he wants
to trade his van for my shoes?

37:25.510 --> 37:26.740
This is definitely a first.

37:26.740 --> 37:28.340
I guarantee you these shoes
cost more than

37:28.340 --> 37:29.670
what you've got in this van.

37:29.680 --> 37:33.210
So I want all the money
in your pocket and the van.

37:33.210 --> 37:35.380
Alright. Deal.
Alright. Cool.

37:35.380 --> 37:36.920
I got the van
in a little trade out.

37:36.920 --> 37:37.950
I did pretty good on it.

37:37.950 --> 37:39.180
I don't have anything in it.

37:39.190 --> 37:41.150
I love doing business
with you, man.

37:41.150 --> 37:42.350
I feel pretty awesome now.

37:42.360 --> 37:43.720
I've got the complete outfit.

37:43.720 --> 37:46.420
I've got the sasquatch sweater
and shoes.

37:46.430 --> 37:48.490
It'll complete my outfit.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.630
Yeah, good doing business
with you, man.

37:50.630 --> 37:51.930
Good doing business
with you.

37:51.930 --> 37:53.230
Your shop is only a couple
miles from here, right?

37:53.230 --> 37:54.400
Yeah.
Well, you can walk it.

37:54.400 --> 37:56.200
Well, today is already
starting out weird.

37:56.200 --> 38:00.410
I got a van and $42
for some furry slippers.

38:00.410 --> 38:03.070
Oh, yeah, I think
I just screwed richard.

38:03.080 --> 38:04.880
That's the way gas monkey
does it.

38:04.880 --> 38:07.080
Oh, they fit like a glove.

38:07.080 --> 38:08.510
How sweet it is.

38:08.520 --> 38:10.350
[ engine revs, tires squeal ]
whoo!

38:10.350 --> 38:12.180
Narrator:
Coming up on "fast n' loud"...

38:12.190 --> 38:14.550
-Let's dance.
-...Mike starts spraying...

38:14.550 --> 38:17.090
[bleep] god dang it.

38:17.090 --> 38:19.860
What is going wrong
with this thing right now?

38:19.860 --> 38:21.260
Narrator:
But ends up praying.

38:21.260 --> 38:24.430
Trust me, this is as scary
for me as it is for y'all.

38:34.570 --> 38:37.380
Russell: Barry, for this
"brady bunch" house renovation,

38:37.380 --> 38:39.740
what other fun stuff
are you guys doing?

38:39.750 --> 38:41.250
They're building
the carport garage

38:41.250 --> 38:42.510
thing you guys
had back then, too?

38:42.520 --> 38:44.720
Absolutely, and there's still
some dialogue

38:44.720 --> 38:45.980
about whether or not
in the backyard

38:45.990 --> 38:48.390
we're going to use grass
or astroturf.

38:48.390 --> 38:49.950
Astroturf
is what you guys had, right?

38:49.960 --> 38:51.120
Got to be.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.490
Maybe there would be
a couple more elements

38:52.490 --> 38:54.630
that are as iconic as the horse
in the backyard or the...

38:54.630 --> 38:56.290
Or your scarf
as johnny bravo?

38:56.300 --> 38:58.330
All six of us get an outfit
like this?

38:58.330 --> 39:01.130
Russell is like a walking
encyclopedia of

39:01.130 --> 39:02.770
"brady bunch" episodes.

39:02.770 --> 39:04.270
You guys did a bunch of this,
though, I think.

39:04.270 --> 39:05.300
Barry:
I know you got the moves,
yeah, yeah.

39:05.310 --> 39:06.640
You guys did that a lot.

39:06.640 --> 39:09.040
I think russell might know
more trivia

39:09.040 --> 39:12.340
about the "brady bunch"
then I do, and I wrote the book.

39:12.350 --> 39:14.150
I watched it
a time or two.

39:14.150 --> 39:15.910
Go a wagon, whoo!

39:24.590 --> 39:32.460
â™ª

39:32.470 --> 39:34.530
yeah.
No, super cool, 5 grand.

39:34.530 --> 39:36.330
That's a deal.
Alright. Thanks.

39:36.340 --> 39:37.640
I'm not going to lie,
I really didn't think

39:37.640 --> 39:39.100
I'd make
anything on this camaro,

39:39.110 --> 39:41.470
but I found a collector that
wants to buy it for 5 grand,

39:41.480 --> 39:44.140
and that makes
gas monkey 1,500 bucks.

39:44.140 --> 39:45.310
Hey, josh.
Josh: Yeah?

39:45.310 --> 39:47.410
Grab that black camaro
and bring it around.

39:47.410 --> 39:50.220
I'm pretty sure tony sold
it already.

39:50.220 --> 39:52.350
Well, it definitely needs
a little work.

39:52.350 --> 39:53.550
It's a project, for sure.

39:53.550 --> 39:55.320
So if that's the right car?

39:55.320 --> 39:57.160
Alright. Good deal.

39:57.160 --> 40:01.660
Today we're getting rid
of this 1974 chevy camaro.

40:01.660 --> 40:03.630
-Yeah, you're good.
-It was on my inventory.

40:03.630 --> 40:05.260
When I looked out there
and saw it, it's like,

40:05.270 --> 40:06.560
"that car needs to go."

40:06.570 --> 40:08.830
so I put it on the old
interwebs, found a buyer for it.

40:08.840 --> 40:10.240
He's actually in alabama.

40:10.240 --> 40:11.600
So he calls up a transporter.

40:11.610 --> 40:13.240
He came and picked the car up.

40:13.240 --> 40:14.570
Which one?
Right here.

40:14.570 --> 40:15.840
Right here?

40:15.840 --> 40:17.280
I couldn't be happier
that it's leaving.

40:17.280 --> 40:20.210
Gas monkey gets paid, and I know
richard is going to be happy.

40:20.210 --> 40:21.850
All right, buddy.
Be safe. [ laughs ]

40:24.050 --> 40:26.550
hey, he told me you just sold
the black camaro yesterday.

40:26.550 --> 40:28.190
Yeah, yeah, I got rid
of that thing.

40:28.190 --> 40:29.450
How much?

40:29.460 --> 40:32.160
Man, $3,500.

40:32.160 --> 40:34.260
Daggum it, tony.
You got to tell me these things.

40:34.260 --> 40:36.060
I just sold it to a guy
for $5,000.

40:36.060 --> 40:38.100
He had just hung up with him.
He said he was on his way.

40:38.100 --> 40:39.400
Man, it's already gone.

40:39.400 --> 40:42.670
It's, like, over the curb,
busting bugs now.

40:42.670 --> 40:44.370
Fifteen-hundred dollar loss,

40:44.370 --> 40:46.940
you got to tell me
when you sell something.

40:46.940 --> 40:48.040
I sold the camaro.

40:48.040 --> 40:49.640
Yeah, thanks.

40:49.640 --> 40:56.380

40:56.380 --> 40:58.450
-you know it.
-You know it.

40:58.450 --> 41:00.990
Right now, it's prime time.

41:02.820 --> 41:04.790
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

41:04.790 --> 41:07.690
Coy:
Finally, I can shoot the '69
plymouth wagon with sealer

41:07.690 --> 41:09.590
and really get to
start painting it.

41:09.600 --> 41:13.830
The '69 plymouth is going to
play a huge part in hgtv's big

41:13.830 --> 41:16.500
"brady bunch" house
renovation reveal.

41:16.500 --> 41:17.870
Tony:
I'm getting lucky.

41:17.870 --> 41:20.000
Me and the guys got all the body
work and prep knocked out.

41:20.010 --> 41:22.310
Then I got richard to approve
the color I whipped up.

41:22.310 --> 41:24.380
It's a more modern version
of the original

41:24.380 --> 41:26.010
"brady bunch"
wagon's brown color.

41:26.010 --> 41:28.810
Richard: I think that's close
to the milky brown it was,

41:28.820 --> 41:30.450
but it's got
some attitude to it.

41:30.450 --> 41:32.950
He also approved the flat black
that he decided last minute

41:32.950 --> 41:34.650
that he wanted to use
on the hood.

41:38.090 --> 41:39.560
Tony: Like a land yacht.

41:39.560 --> 41:41.590
Coy: I'm going to let the guys
take the freshly-primered body

41:41.600 --> 41:43.160
so I can throw
on the flat black

41:43.160 --> 41:45.130
that richard wants added
to the color scheme.

41:45.130 --> 41:48.030
Then after that,
I can do the body

41:48.030 --> 41:50.070
and the panels the brown
that I showed him.

41:50.070 --> 41:51.300
Alright.

41:51.300 --> 41:53.100
So I'm about to get started
on this wagon,

41:53.110 --> 41:54.640
which will be fantastic.

41:54.640 --> 41:57.080
I'm going to go ahead
and get the hood

41:57.080 --> 41:59.110
and some small engine parts
knocked out.

41:59.110 --> 42:01.210
All right.
Let's dance.

42:10.290 --> 42:11.660
[bleep]

42:11.660 --> 42:15.690
god dang it, what is going wrong
with this thing right now?

42:15.700 --> 42:21.500
Damn it, I don't have no damn
air pressure in my paint gun.

42:25.340 --> 42:26.770
It's not working.

42:26.770 --> 42:28.170
What's it not doing, mike?

42:28.170 --> 42:29.270
It's not coming on.

42:29.280 --> 42:31.840
So the fans,
like, the pressure?

42:31.850 --> 42:33.380
This booth takes two fans.

42:33.380 --> 42:38.620
So it has this fan which brings
air into the paint booth, okay,

42:38.620 --> 42:41.120
and then we have a fan
on the roof that takes air

42:41.120 --> 42:43.860
out of the paint booth,
and they got to work together

42:43.860 --> 42:47.490
or else it doesn't allow
any air to come in.

42:47.490 --> 42:49.130
I can't even use a paint gun
in there.

42:49.130 --> 42:50.760
Will you turn that on?

42:53.430 --> 42:55.470
-I heard it click.
-Watch this.

42:55.470 --> 42:57.170
-Power is still on.
-Please don't die.

42:57.170 --> 42:59.300
[ fans spin up ]

42:59.310 --> 43:00.410
that's how it's supposed
to sound.

43:00.410 --> 43:01.770
Yeah.

43:01.780 --> 43:03.470
Just some reason,
that breaker ain't holding in.

43:03.480 --> 43:04.980
You want to know why
a gas monkey paint job

43:04.980 --> 43:06.240
is so flawless?

43:06.250 --> 43:08.450
First off, I'm a bad ass.

43:08.450 --> 43:11.350
Two, I use the best materials
that are out there.

43:11.350 --> 43:14.290
Three, I have a
computer-controlled positive air

43:14.290 --> 43:18.420
flow paint booth that allows
quick and even curing

43:18.430 --> 43:20.430
and also prevents overspray.

43:20.430 --> 43:22.160
If the booth fans
don't work right,

43:22.160 --> 43:24.200
all that goes to hell
in a handbasket.

43:24.200 --> 43:27.730
So I'm hoping john,
our electronics expert,

43:27.730 --> 43:29.630
can make sure and fix this.

43:29.640 --> 43:31.700
[ fans spin up ]

43:31.710 --> 43:33.400
yeah, that's...

43:33.410 --> 43:34.970
Your fan motor
is not working right.

43:34.980 --> 43:37.440
So it sounds like the capacitor
for the motor is no good.

43:37.440 --> 43:41.050
John thinks the capacitor for
the fans needs to be replaced.

43:41.050 --> 43:43.880
We've had similar problems
with the paint booth before,

43:43.880 --> 43:46.850
and it can take up to 3 days to
get our guy out here to fix it.

43:46.850 --> 43:48.690
That's<i> if</i> he's got the part.

43:48.690 --> 43:50.050
Yeah, there might be even
more than one,

43:50.060 --> 43:51.320
and one of them is bad.

43:51.320 --> 43:53.830
You know, it needs that jolt
of power to start going.

43:53.830 --> 43:55.190
Okay.

43:55.200 --> 43:56.430
We're smack dab in the middle
of building

43:56.430 --> 43:58.660
the 1969 "brady bunch"
plymouth station wagon

43:58.670 --> 44:00.230
for none
other than barry williams,

44:00.230 --> 44:02.170
who played greg brady
on the hit series

44:02.170 --> 44:03.530
"the brady bunch."

44:03.540 --> 44:04.840
far out.

44:04.840 --> 44:06.240
But the paint booth is
having electrical problems,

44:06.240 --> 44:09.770
which means we might not
get the car done on time.

44:09.780 --> 44:10.880
You see, about a week ago,

44:10.880 --> 44:13.180
barry came by the shop
with a big ask.

44:13.180 --> 44:15.080
Barry:
This is what I had in mind,

44:15.080 --> 44:17.780
reconstruct
the "brady bunch" wagon.

44:17.780 --> 44:18.850
Alright.
Right?

44:18.850 --> 44:20.120
With gas monkey attitude.

44:20.120 --> 44:22.050
Okay, that's the part
I was waiting on.

44:22.060 --> 44:24.690
So barry wants the "brady" wagon
to be part of hgtv's

44:24.690 --> 44:27.230
big renovation of the original
"brady bunch" house

44:27.230 --> 44:29.990
from the tv series
which debuted in 1969.

44:30.000 --> 44:33.060
So I figured teaming up with
the "brady bunch" brand and hgtv

44:33.070 --> 44:34.600
would be a massive
marketing and promotion

44:34.600 --> 44:36.830
and opportunity
for gas monkey garage.

44:36.840 --> 44:37.870
Alright.
Let's do it.

44:37.870 --> 44:39.870
Cool.
Once I agreed to build it,

44:39.870 --> 44:42.940
we had 30 days
to deliver the car.

44:42.940 --> 44:45.740
Hill:
Nicest satellite wagon
you ever did see.

44:45.750 --> 44:46.940
Russell: There it is.

44:46.950 --> 44:48.610
Three days later,
russell and I were in iowa

44:48.620 --> 44:52.350
to buy a near-mint-condition
1969 plymouth satellite wagon

44:52.350 --> 44:54.350
whereupon we were
promptly fleeced.

44:54.350 --> 44:55.620
I got to have $15,000.

44:55.620 --> 44:57.020
Alright.
Let's do it.

44:57.020 --> 44:59.160
But the clock was ticking,
the car was nearly flawless,

44:59.160 --> 45:02.030
and we had to get
to building.

45:02.030 --> 45:04.030
Hey, the whole bunch
is here.

45:04.030 --> 45:05.460
Russell:
Oh, my goodness.

45:05.470 --> 45:07.700
With 25 days left, we came up
with a plan to gas monkey up

45:07.700 --> 45:11.200
the wagon and still
keep the "brady" brand.

45:11.200 --> 45:12.500
I bought the car for 15 grand

45:12.510 --> 45:14.940
and gave the monkeys
another 15 grand to build it,

45:14.940 --> 45:16.210
and we still have
a "brady bunch"

45:16.210 --> 45:17.440
of stuff left to do.

45:17.440 --> 45:19.340
You're about to see the hottest
set of wheels

45:19.350 --> 45:20.950
this side of indianapolis.

45:20.950 --> 45:22.610
Richard:
So things were going real good
with the build

45:22.620 --> 45:23.950
until we found the tiki,

45:23.950 --> 45:26.120
and then everything started
rolling down hill fast.

45:26.120 --> 45:28.590
What is this?

45:28.590 --> 45:31.590
-God dang it.
-What did you do?

45:31.590 --> 45:33.260
Richard: If you don't know
what a tiki idol is,

45:33.260 --> 45:35.330
then you need to brush up
on your "brady bunch."

45:35.330 --> 45:36.590
it'll bring you good luck.

45:36.600 --> 45:38.800
A couple of the brady kids
found one in hawaii,

45:38.800 --> 45:42.530
and everything started
going sideways after that.

45:42.540 --> 45:43.800
Now our paint booth is broke,

45:43.800 --> 45:45.940
and we can't do anything
until it's fixed.

45:45.940 --> 45:48.370
[bleep]. Dang it.

45:48.370 --> 45:50.910
What has gone wrong
with this thing right now?

45:50.910 --> 45:52.380
Our entire schedule
might be blown

45:52.380 --> 45:55.580
because building can't continue
until the entire car is painted.

45:55.580 --> 45:57.950
So that's the story
of a wagon named brady,

45:57.950 --> 45:59.480
at least up until now.

45:59.490 --> 46:02.620
[ beeping ]

46:02.620 --> 46:05.520
ah, so you're what's
causing all the fuss.

46:05.530 --> 46:08.060
Alright. What's not functioning
is this little part.

46:08.060 --> 46:09.090
It's defective.

46:09.100 --> 46:10.730
I've bypassed it.

46:12.870 --> 46:14.300
Well, how's it looking?
Thank god.

46:14.300 --> 46:15.830
I think I might have found
the culprit.

46:15.840 --> 46:16.870
I will gladly hit switch.

46:16.870 --> 46:18.440
You not going
to get electrocuted.

46:18.440 --> 46:20.070
I hope not.

46:23.110 --> 46:25.880
I'm not holding it.

46:25.880 --> 46:27.310
No hands.

46:27.310 --> 46:29.180
Okay.
So it's working?

46:29.180 --> 46:30.920
There's a delay box
in this thing

46:30.920 --> 46:33.220
to add a delay
before it turns on.

46:33.220 --> 46:34.820
So did you remove
the delay adapter or...

46:34.820 --> 46:35.850
Yeah, I removed it.

46:35.860 --> 46:37.420
But does it need
the delay switch?

46:37.420 --> 46:38.460
I mean, is that what's...

46:38.460 --> 46:40.090
It doesn't need it to function.

46:40.090 --> 46:42.060
Coy: Paint booth fans
are able to run.

46:42.060 --> 46:47.270
So I'm ready to start painting
and get that behind us.

46:47.270 --> 46:48.730
Yes, yes, yes.

46:48.740 --> 46:51.070
I'm going to go ahead and shoot
the hood a nice flat black.

46:51.070 --> 46:53.370
The flat black hood is a hot rod
look that comes

46:53.370 --> 46:56.010
from rally racing cars back
in the '60s and '70s.

46:56.010 --> 46:57.710
When the sun hit
the glossy paint,

46:57.710 --> 47:00.340
it would cause a glare
that would distract the driver.

47:00.350 --> 47:03.280
So drivers would paint their
hoods with a flat black paint

47:03.280 --> 47:04.880
because it absorbs light.

47:04.880 --> 47:07.050
Speed lovers brought this trend
from the track

47:07.050 --> 47:08.690
to their hot rods.

47:11.290 --> 47:12.760
Alright.

47:12.760 --> 47:14.560
Once this hood panel dries,
I'll paint the rest of the body.

47:14.560 --> 47:16.560
Hopefully, the paint booth
will keep running.

47:16.560 --> 47:18.430

Oh, no.
It's a maverick.

47:51.260 --> 47:52.860
But what kind of maverick?

47:52.870 --> 47:54.300

a grabber, then.

There's a lot of cool cars

48:44.220 --> 48:46.650
I can tell by looking.
I see a lot of cars covered.

48:46.650 --> 48:48.620
I see a lot of things hidden.
What else you got around here?

48:48.620 --> 48:49.790
James: I've got some cars
right over here.

-Some cars over here.
-Alright. Let's go.

These ones ain't for sale,
though.

48:52.830 --> 48:54.230
I don't know, you'd have
to get my brother bill.

48:54.230 --> 48:55.290
I don't know where he's at.

48:55.300 --> 48:56.590
What, the saturn?

48:56.600 --> 48:58.160
The saturn is for sale.

48:58.160 --> 49:00.160
That'd be way cool
if it was a two-door.

Ooh, look at that.

Wait a second, now you've

keeps talking to me

from under a truck.
You want to bet?

He's 11 months older than me.

Me and him butt heads
all the time.

We're still partners in them.

That's my car.

49:30.230 --> 49:31.900
Hey, get away from that car,
rawlings.

49:31.900 --> 49:33.100
Of course, bill doesn't
want anybody

by them cars,

the covers off.

Well, it doesn't look like
you've driven it

49:38.200 --> 49:40.100

-Huh?

49:40.110 --> 49:41.370
You haven't driven it
in a while.

-No.
-The thing ain't bad.

49:42.880 --> 49:44.540
I mean, it's got some body

it doesn't matter anyway.

49:46.010 --> 49:47.480

with it.

in the sky number on this car?

Come on underneath here,
and we'll talk about it.

Bill:
Why, those ss's ain't for sale,
rawlings, not this time.

49:58.830 --> 50:01.030
That's a lot of money over
there sitting on the ground.

And I could make you
a nice cement pad right here.

50:04.100 --> 50:05.800

What is it?

50:11.100 --> 50:13.200
I'll give you $25,000

It will, sir.

50:20.350 --> 50:21.780
We've already had this argument
with plenty of people,

50:21.780 --> 50:23.180
and you're
absolutely correct.

50:23.180 --> 50:25.350
You put $150,000 in that car,
you can get $125,000,

50:25.350 --> 50:27.650

Let me think about it.

50:31.590 --> 50:34.490

at hand on the maverick.

Alright. Cool,
where's the maverick?

of the high performance market.

50:44.700 --> 50:46.540
The cut price v8 coupe
didn't offer much

50:46.540 --> 50:48.540
in the way of performance,
but you can't go wrong

50:48.540 --> 50:50.740
with putting a v8
in a lightweight car.

51:15.370 --> 51:17.270
I have an affinity
for these cars because,

51:17.270 --> 51:18.800
as everybody knows,
my first car

51:18.810 --> 51:20.840
was a '74 mercury comet,

51:20.840 --> 51:24.640
and the "lesser species"
was the ford maverick.

51:24.640 --> 51:25.680
It ain't got no smell.

51:25.680 --> 51:27.410
It is missing its vinyl top.

51:27.410 --> 51:29.310
The interior is blown out.

It is ugly, but it's

is the left front.

It's got to go
to california.

55:48.340 --> 55:51.040
Boy, that was pretty sneaky
putting us on like that.

55:51.040 --> 55:53.840
Okay.
Air shocks.

55:53.850 --> 55:55.480
Those look right?
Is that it?

55:55.480 --> 55:57.610
They look right.

55:57.620 --> 55:59.350
Jason and john are installing
the new air shocks

55:59.350 --> 56:00.720
in the back of the wagon
that'll give it

56:00.720 --> 56:03.120
that aggressive hot rod rake.

56:03.120 --> 56:05.460
Russell:
If these fit, I'll be shocked.

56:05.460 --> 56:07.890
[ laughter ]

56:07.890 --> 56:09.190
he's on a roll today.

56:09.200 --> 56:10.430
Jason: The good thing about
these type of shocks,

56:10.430 --> 56:11.630
you can adjust the rake
of the car,

56:11.630 --> 56:14.060
which is the lean
back to front.

56:14.070 --> 56:17.070
So since we didn't do
any major suspension work,

56:17.070 --> 56:19.500
this is one way we can alter
the rake of the car,

56:19.510 --> 56:20.900
and that's what
we want to go with.

56:20.910 --> 56:22.270
So once we have our wheels here,
we know what it looks like,

56:22.270 --> 56:23.570
then we'll adjust these shocks
to make it

56:23.580 --> 56:26.040
the coolest it can be.

56:26.050 --> 56:27.580
Jason: I'll give you that one.
That'll be the driver's side.

56:27.580 --> 56:29.210
Josh: This isn't the first time
we've given a car

56:29.220 --> 56:31.010
this ready-to-fight
body position.

56:31.020 --> 56:34.790
We recently did it on
the '34 ford 5-window.

56:34.790 --> 56:36.750
Even when it was standing still,
that car looked like

56:36.760 --> 56:39.660
it was ready
to knock you into next week.

56:39.660 --> 56:43.490
We're going to mock up
the side flaps real quick.

56:43.500 --> 56:45.660
Since we're going from fun
family wagon to badass

56:45.660 --> 56:47.460
"brady" machine,
we threw on some leg pipes

56:47.470 --> 56:49.200
for maximum intimidation.

56:51.700 --> 56:52.970
Josh: Okay.
Let's see how it looks.

56:52.970 --> 56:53.970
It's going to be hard
to see with the lift,

56:53.970 --> 56:55.670
but at least
we can get an idea.

56:55.670 --> 56:57.440
Running these fatty exhaust
tubes along the rocker

56:57.440 --> 56:59.740
gives it a badass look
and gives the engine a throaty

56:59.750 --> 57:03.450
'70s hot rod growl.

57:03.450 --> 57:04.820
How do you feel about it?
You happy with it?

57:04.820 --> 57:06.980
Josh: I think so.
I got the tip at the end.

57:06.990 --> 57:08.620
-Yeah.
-I think it's working out.

57:10.660 --> 57:11.890
But what about
tucking it more?

57:11.890 --> 57:13.990
Because you'll have the height
from the tires.

57:13.990 --> 57:15.130
Yeah.

57:15.130 --> 57:17.330
Where this comes out,
we can tuck it in.

57:17.330 --> 57:18.600
It could go in a touch.

57:18.600 --> 57:19.960
So let's do that.

57:19.970 --> 57:22.000
Russell:
Sometimes you got to pay
a price to look cool,

57:22.000 --> 57:24.330
and in the case of these
side pipes, that price

57:24.340 --> 57:26.700
is going to be third-degree
burns on your ankles.

57:26.710 --> 57:28.410
-Too much?
-That's looking good.
No, it's looking good.

57:28.410 --> 57:29.740
Russell: But we don't want to
burn a brady,

57:29.740 --> 57:31.140
so we're going to
tuck them in a little.

57:31.140 --> 57:32.410
Jason:
I think it's the right look.

57:32.410 --> 57:33.640
It's better tucked.

57:33.650 --> 57:34.910
It's perfect right
at the edge of the...

57:34.910 --> 57:36.010
Yep.
It actually looks pretty cool.

57:36.020 --> 57:37.150
-Coming off the [indistinct]
-yeah.

57:37.150 --> 57:38.680

I don't mind it.

57:46.030 --> 57:47.830
Man #2: That's more impressive
than I thought it would be.

57:47.830 --> 57:49.460
That was easy.

57:52.300 --> 57:53.700
Brother.

57:53.700 --> 57:56.330
Richard is extremely
proud of this car.

57:56.340 --> 57:57.670
Coy: Why?

57:57.670 --> 57:59.570
It's that high school thing
he keeps going back to.

57:59.570 --> 58:01.170
And it's got green on it.

58:01.170 --> 58:03.070
Coy:
Me and the paint and body crew
are done with all the work

58:03.080 --> 58:04.270
on the "brady bunch" wagon.

58:04.280 --> 58:05.710
So now we have a little bit
of free time

58:05.710 --> 58:07.880
to work on the '73 maverick.
-Not cool.

58:07.880 --> 58:09.250
So what is he wanting done
to it?

58:09.250 --> 58:11.220
I mean, obviously it needs
a little bit of everything.

58:11.220 --> 58:12.680
A little polish,

58:12.690 --> 58:14.250
keenan convinced him
to paint the roof green

58:14.250 --> 58:15.650
instead of re-vinyling it.
-Yeah, okay.

58:15.650 --> 58:17.860
We're just going to do enough
tune up to make it run

58:17.860 --> 58:19.260
and get it out of here
as quickly as possible.

58:19.260 --> 58:20.520
Okay, so
we're tuning it up.

58:20.530 --> 58:21.560
-Yes.
-A resale detail.

58:21.560 --> 58:22.560
Painting the roof.
Yeah.

58:22.560 --> 58:24.030
-Yeah.
-Okay, so a resale detail.

58:24.030 --> 58:26.130
So we're buffing it and that
kind of stuff and the roof.

58:26.130 --> 58:27.600
-Yep.
-Alright.

58:27.600 --> 58:29.100
Well, I'm going to go get chad
and get the tune up stuff.

58:29.100 --> 58:31.270
Coy:
If you two want to start
running polish,

58:31.270 --> 58:33.070
I'll knock out the roof.

58:33.070 --> 58:35.040
I like that idea.

58:35.040 --> 58:40.840
â™ª

58:40.850 --> 58:43.250
the guys are using
a dual action polisher

58:43.250 --> 58:46.120
with a heavy duty compound
to buff out the scratches

58:46.120 --> 58:49.890
and bring back some shine
to the paint.

58:49.890 --> 58:51.360
Keenan:
It looks like a pinto.

58:51.360 --> 58:52.690

We used to make fun of all
the kids who drove

58:52.690 --> 58:54.120
mavericks in school.

58:54.130 --> 58:55.760
I get to sand the rust
off the roof.

58:55.760 --> 58:59.360
It was originally vinyl,
and those rarely age well.

58:59.370 --> 59:01.130
So we're going to paint
it green.

59:03.340 --> 59:05.170
What are you idiots doing?
-Position is key.

59:05.170 --> 59:08.170
Got the color robot out here.

59:08.170 --> 59:10.370
Coy: To match the sun-aged
factory paint,

59:10.380 --> 59:12.740
we use these color samples
with a hole in the center

59:12.750 --> 59:14.550
to eyeball the closest match.

59:47.580 --> 59:48.950

the maverick grabber

59:48.950 --> 59:50.850
is it wasn't
beaten down too badly,

59:50.850 --> 59:53.220
so with a little bit
of investment and man power,

59:53.220 --> 59:54.590
and a little bit of paint,

59:54.590 --> 59:56.790
it should really up
the resale value.

on this thing.

I love this bfg tire,
but at the same time,

1:00:21.710 --> 1:00:23.080
I don't know
if it's going to fit.

1:00:23.080 --> 1:00:24.720
Josh: To give this wagon
maximum attitude,

1:00:24.720 --> 1:00:26.320
richard wants these wide
wheels and tires

1:00:26.320 --> 1:00:28.920
in the back to contrast
the smaller ones in front.

1:00:28.920 --> 1:00:30.590
I'm just not sure
the rear quarter panel

1:00:30.590 --> 1:00:32.620
has enough clearance
for that much wheel.

Hey, josh, what do you think
about this?

1:00:34.060 --> 1:00:35.360
Let's go ahead and take 0.5
inch off both these lips.

1:00:35.360 --> 1:00:36.430
All right.

1:00:36.430 --> 1:00:38.160
So, cars have a lip
inside of here.

1:00:38.160 --> 1:00:39.360
It's where the inner fender well

1:00:39.370 --> 1:00:41.700
and the outside sheet metal
comes together,

1:00:41.700 --> 1:00:43.170
so there's some extra
sheet metal hanging there.

1:00:43.170 --> 1:00:45.040
I don't know if you can see
these tabs and edges and stuff.

1:00:45.040 --> 1:00:47.070
We need as much room as we
can to fit these big, wide

1:00:47.070 --> 1:00:49.940

get any little extra bit

1:00:49.940 --> 1:00:52.340

because we have no instructional
manual on how to do it.

1:11:05.260 --> 1:11:06.720
It's the same distance,
so...

1:11:06.730 --> 1:11:08.020
Same?
Yeah.

1:11:08.030 --> 1:11:10.190
Luckily even though it
all looks like scrap metal,

1:11:10.200 --> 1:11:12.700
the pieces do fit correctly,
which means I can drill

1:11:12.700 --> 1:11:14.800
where the seat brackets
will bolt onto the floor.

1:11:14.800 --> 1:11:16.400
Later, mike will paint
all of these pieces

1:11:16.400 --> 1:11:21.040
so that they look brand-new.

1:11:21.040 --> 1:11:23.410
Yeah, they need to come down.
But, yeah, that fits now.

1:11:23.410 --> 1:11:25.510
Let's try that old seat cushion
to see how it fits.

1:11:25.510 --> 1:11:27.480
Yeah,
so that just sits there.

1:11:27.480 --> 1:11:30.080
And how does that shut?

1:11:30.080 --> 1:11:32.880
Right over it.

1:11:32.880 --> 1:11:34.320
There, see?
Yeah.

1:11:34.320 --> 1:11:35.650
So it folds up, right?
Sure.

1:11:35.650 --> 1:11:37.820
And the back of the seat
is already on there.

1:11:37.820 --> 1:11:39.990
There's the bottom,
and voilÃ¡.

1:11:39.990 --> 1:11:42.160
Now that we know it all fits,
I'll patch up a few holes,

1:11:42.160 --> 1:11:43.660
and mike will then
paint all the pieces

1:11:43.660 --> 1:11:45.160
so everything will be ready
when the new,

the seat sent off

1:11:55.010 --> 1:11:56.310

get it re-covered.

1:12:11.820 --> 1:12:13.020
There it is.

1:12:13.020 --> 1:12:14.560
I found a potential buyer
for the maverick,

1:12:14.560 --> 1:12:17.130
but I'm a little worried because
she doesn't seem like the usual

1:12:17.130 --> 1:12:20.130
maverick buyer, and I need
to make at least $7,500 on this

1:12:20.130 --> 1:12:22.030
to win my bet with dennis.

I'm heather boucher, and I'm
from jacksonville, florida.

1:12:27.970 --> 1:12:31.770
I'm here today to take a look
at the '73 ford maverick.

1:12:31.780 --> 1:12:33.210
What's the story?
Because now that you're here,

1:12:33.210 --> 1:12:36.050
you don't exactly look like
a maverick grabber buyer.

1:12:36.050 --> 1:12:38.010
So, we have a two-year-old
daughter, julia.

1:12:38.020 --> 1:12:41.450
She picked out
a ford maverick hot wheel

1:12:41.450 --> 1:12:43.390
out of a wall
full of hot wheels.

1:12:43.390 --> 1:12:44.750
Okay.

1:12:44.760 --> 1:12:46.190
So when I saw this was for sale,
I had to come look at it.

1:12:46.190 --> 1:12:48.830
If I buy the car, it'll be
my daughter's first car

1:12:48.830 --> 1:12:51.330
that she drives
when she turns 16,

1:12:51.330 --> 1:12:54.360
after my husband
and her restore it.

1:12:57.500 --> 1:12:59.140
It sounds really good.

1:12:59.140 --> 1:13:00.740
They're great little cars.

1:13:00.740 --> 1:13:03.910
It was my everyday driver when
I had my green one like this.

1:13:03.910 --> 1:13:07.010
Was it all green or was it green
and white like this one?

1:13:07.010 --> 1:13:11.250
It was all green: Green outside,
green inside, green everything.

1:13:11.250 --> 1:13:13.080
Too bad that my
daughter's favorite

1:13:13.080 --> 1:13:16.620
hot wheel
wasn't a mustang or a shelby,

1:13:16.620 --> 1:13:19.090
but the second child,
her middle name is going to be

1:13:19.090 --> 1:13:22.430
shelby, so I have
a second chance with her.

1:13:22.430 --> 1:13:27.300
Like I said, these little cars
are coming up in value.

1:13:27.300 --> 1:13:28.930
Realistically I believe
these cars are going to be

1:13:28.930 --> 1:13:31.570
bringing $20,000 to $25,000
in another 5 years,

1:13:31.570 --> 1:13:34.470
but they're not yet,
so $12,500?

1:13:34.470 --> 1:13:35.740
No.

1:13:35.740 --> 1:13:38.880
I don't know.
It's a ford maverick.

1:13:38.880 --> 1:13:41.140
Look at that interior.

1:13:41.150 --> 1:13:45.010
I'm thinking more like
$7,000.

1:13:45.020 --> 1:13:47.750
Nah, I think I can get $10,000
for it all day long,

1:13:47.750 --> 1:13:50.520
but you're here,
so how about $10,000?

1:13:50.520 --> 1:13:52.160
It'll be a nice car restored.

1:13:52.160 --> 1:13:56.060
My daughter has the hot wheel,
so I can do 10.

pump can't be overtight,

over the threads.

1:18:38.210 --> 1:18:39.910
<i> Marcia?</i>
<i> I'm not marcia.</i>

1:18:39.910 --> 1:18:41.810
<i> Isn't that dumb?</i>

1:18:41.810 --> 1:18:44.280
<i> Get lost.</i>

1:18:44.280 --> 1:18:45.750
Richard: Who didn't love to
watch "the brady bunch"

1:18:45.750 --> 1:18:49.150
back in the day?

1:18:49.150 --> 1:18:51.550
It's become a nostalgic piece
of television history.

1:18:51.560 --> 1:18:53.960
Cindy, you're too young
to understand.

1:18:53.960 --> 1:18:56.430
Reminding us of when things were
just a bit more hip,

1:18:56.430 --> 1:18:58.590
a little more wholesome
and a lot more groovy.

1:18:58.600 --> 1:19:03.630
â™ª

1:19:03.630 --> 1:19:05.870
that was then, and this is now.

1:19:07.170 --> 1:19:11.510
[ engine starts ]

1:19:11.510 --> 1:19:12.580
man:
Tony is hitting me, dad.

1:19:12.580 --> 1:19:13.810
Tony:
I'm not touching him.

1:19:13.810 --> 1:19:15.080
Jason: Hey, when do we get
to eat lunch?

1:19:15.080 --> 1:19:16.180
You kids better be quiet.

1:19:16.180 --> 1:19:17.810
Don't make me
pull this car over.

1:19:19.980 --> 1:19:23.390
Rebuild, reconstruct
the "brady bunch" wagon.

1:19:23.390 --> 1:19:24.490
Alright.
Right?

1:19:24.490 --> 1:19:26.090
With gas monkey attitude.

1:19:26.090 --> 1:19:28.060
Richard: When barry williams,
aka greg brady,

1:19:28.060 --> 1:19:29.460
told me that he wanted
to recreate

1:19:29.460 --> 1:19:32.700
the "brady bunch" station wagon
as part of hgtv's brady

1:19:32.700 --> 1:19:34.800
house renovation,
I said, "hell yeah."

1:19:34.800 --> 1:19:38.100
far out.

1:19:38.100 --> 1:19:41.140
I paid 15 grand for this
'69 plymouth satellite wagon

1:19:41.140 --> 1:19:42.840
and gave the monkeys
another 15 grand

1:19:42.840 --> 1:19:44.510
and 25 days to get it done.

1:19:44.510 --> 1:19:45.910
The side paneling
is all vinyl?

1:19:45.910 --> 1:19:48.410
It is.
Ugh.

1:19:48.410 --> 1:19:49.750
The paint and body crew
yanked off

1:19:49.750 --> 1:19:52.210
the wood panel decal and chrome,
and mike worked his magic

1:19:52.220 --> 1:19:53.550
with the brady brown body color,

1:19:53.550 --> 1:19:57.250
adding a splash
of gas monkey attitude.

1:19:57.260 --> 1:19:59.020
Are we there yet?
I got to pee.

1:19:59.020 --> 1:20:00.220
All right.
You kids be quiet.

1:20:00.220 --> 1:20:01.960
I need to
concentrate on the road.

1:20:05.660 --> 1:20:07.930
We upped the cool factor
by blacking out the hood

1:20:07.930 --> 1:20:10.470
and ultimately decided to add
a streamlined vinyl graphic

1:20:10.470 --> 1:20:12.100
with the gas monkey logo.

1:20:12.100 --> 1:20:14.870
Now everyone will know who
created this kick-ass beast.

1:20:17.310 --> 1:20:19.780
For big muscle appeal,
we threw on side exhaust pipes

1:20:19.780 --> 1:20:22.810
to give the 318 v8 engine
a deep, throaty growl.

1:20:25.020 --> 1:20:27.080
And to make this the most
intimidating grocery grabber

1:20:27.080 --> 1:20:29.020
ever, we gave it
a forward-leaning stance

1:20:29.020 --> 1:20:31.350
with air shocks
to complete the dragster look,

1:20:31.360 --> 1:20:34.490
along with classic rims
and tires.

1:20:34.490 --> 1:20:35.930
For the interior,
we kept the original

1:20:35.930 --> 1:20:37.560
avocado green upholstery,

1:20:37.560 --> 1:20:40.800
but added an impossible-to-find
third-row seat wayback

1:20:40.800 --> 1:20:43.430
in the back
so the whole family can fit in.

1:20:43.430 --> 1:20:44.800
And to keep everybody
comfortable

1:20:44.800 --> 1:20:47.000
and dry on road trips,
we fitted the wagon with custom

1:20:47.000 --> 1:20:49.540
weather stripping from
steele weather products.

1:20:52.810 --> 1:20:54.810
So, with the souped-up
brady-mobile ready for hair

1:20:54.810 --> 1:20:56.410
and makeup,

1:20:56.410 --> 1:21:01.450
â™ª

1:21:01.450 --> 1:21:03.650
we're handing it over to our
friends at intercity lines,

1:21:03.650 --> 1:21:06.420
who will ship it off to
hollywood for its big premiere.

1:21:06.420 --> 1:21:12.760
â™ª

1:21:12.760 --> 1:21:19.130
â™ª

1:21:19.140 --> 1:21:21.270
so, today is a big day
because we're bringing

1:21:21.270 --> 1:21:23.940
our "brady bunch" wagon to
the brady bunch house.

1:21:23.940 --> 1:21:25.110
Hey, richard,
I have them in sight.

1:21:25.110 --> 1:21:27.210
Are you all set?
<i> -Ten-four.</i>

1:21:27.210 --> 1:21:28.380
All right.
Sit tight.

1:21:28.380 --> 1:21:29.650
Hey, guys, come on over here
for a second.

1:21:29.650 --> 1:21:31.250
And barry has planned
this all out,

1:21:31.250 --> 1:21:33.920
and he has not told the rest
of the cast that he got with me

1:21:33.920 --> 1:21:36.020
and the rest of the gas monkey
gang to have us build

1:21:36.020 --> 1:21:38.050
a '69 plymouth satellite wagon.

1:21:38.060 --> 1:21:39.360
And so I'm pretty stoked,

1:21:39.360 --> 1:21:40.960
especially since it gets
to be a surprise,

1:21:40.960 --> 1:21:42.290
and I get to drive it in.

1:21:42.290 --> 1:21:45.130
I just hope
marcia still looks good.

1:21:45.130 --> 1:21:47.600
Okay, richard.
Go for it. Hit it.

1:21:47.600 --> 1:21:49.570
I was a little nervous,
you know? He had a walkie.

1:21:49.570 --> 1:21:51.130
We thought maybe he was
going to blow up the house.

1:21:51.140 --> 1:21:54.700
[ both laugh ]

1:21:54.710 --> 1:21:55.740
[ engine revs ]

1:21:55.740 --> 1:21:58.910
eve:
Look what we've got here.

1:21:58.910 --> 1:22:00.210
What the hell?

1:22:00.210 --> 1:22:01.280
-Oh, my gosh.
-Wow.

1:22:01.280 --> 1:22:02.780
Are you kidding me?

1:22:02.780 --> 1:22:05.410
Are you kidding me?
-Restored.

1:22:05.420 --> 1:22:10.020
[ chatter ]

1:22:10.020 --> 1:22:12.190
I'm amazed.

1:22:12.190 --> 1:22:15.560
Seriously this is
the coolest car ever.

1:22:15.560 --> 1:22:19.130
How you doing?
This is so unexpectedly awesome.

1:22:19.130 --> 1:22:20.430
Man:
Well done, you guys.

1:22:20.430 --> 1:22:23.500
Right away I was struck most
by the great paint job.

1:22:23.500 --> 1:22:25.230
Those guys are really good
at their job.

1:22:25.240 --> 1:22:27.870
Don't burn yourself on the
side pipes getting in now.

1:22:27.870 --> 1:22:29.170
-Are you kidding me?
-Really.

1:22:29.170 --> 1:22:32.910
Blacked-out hood; side pipes;
big, fat rear tires

1:22:32.910 --> 1:22:34.380
giving it that dragster look?

1:22:34.380 --> 1:22:37.480
Very cool.
So hot it burned the wood off.

1:22:37.480 --> 1:22:39.250
The car is hot.
It's beautiful.

1:22:39.250 --> 1:22:41.020
Yeah.
Oh, my gosh.

1:22:41.020 --> 1:22:42.580
It has edge to it.

1:22:42.590 --> 1:22:45.150
Like, I wanted to wear
my leather leggings

1:22:45.160 --> 1:22:46.760
and my biker jacket.

1:22:46.760 --> 1:22:48.120
I actually wanted...

1:22:48.130 --> 1:22:49.630
Maybe get a tattoo.
...To wear those too.

1:22:49.630 --> 1:22:51.030
That would be nice.

1:22:51.030 --> 1:22:53.430
This is totally sleeker, meaner,
faster than the brady original.

1:22:53.430 --> 1:22:55.300
-This is more streamlined.
-Exactly, exactly.

1:22:55.300 --> 1:22:57.630
Tricked up?
Is that the right word?

1:22:57.640 --> 1:22:58.930
Tricked out.
Tricked out.

1:22:58.940 --> 1:23:00.840
Yeah.
You found it.

1:23:00.840 --> 1:23:02.140
-A rumble seat?
-You got the bench.

1:23:02.140 --> 1:23:04.440
Oh, my gosh. Cool.
Oh, my gosh.

1:23:04.440 --> 1:23:05.540
Without that third seat,

1:23:05.540 --> 1:23:07.040
a couple of people
have to be on the roof.

1:23:07.040 --> 1:23:08.780
It was a fun project.
We had a blast.

1:23:08.780 --> 1:23:10.710
Very good.

1:23:10.720 --> 1:23:13.080
Now the only thing left to find
do is take it for a ride.

1:23:13.080 --> 1:23:14.150
-Yeah.
-Heck yeah.

1:23:14.150 --> 1:23:16.750
-Let's go to cincinnati.
-Good luck.

1:23:16.750 --> 1:23:18.620
Maureen: Whoo-hoo.

1:23:18.620 --> 1:23:20.390
[ chatter ]
alright.

1:23:20.390 --> 1:23:22.290
Richard: Not quite as fast
as when you were a kid?

1:23:22.290 --> 1:23:23.330
Right.

1:23:23.330 --> 1:23:24.660
Maybe a little slower
getting in.

1:23:24.660 --> 1:23:27.830
It was just like the old days,
like, instantly,

1:23:27.830 --> 1:23:29.100
except richard was there.

1:23:29.100 --> 1:23:30.500
Let's go to
the grand canyon, guys.

1:23:30.500 --> 1:23:32.370
Maureen:
Let's do road trip.

1:23:32.370 --> 1:23:34.740
I just have to stop
and use the bathroom.

1:23:34.740 --> 1:23:36.840
Are we there yet?

1:23:36.840 --> 1:23:38.440
You kids don't make me
pull this car over.

1:23:38.440 --> 1:23:39.910
[ laughter ]

1:23:39.910 --> 1:23:42.640
barry:
We've got some street cred.
People are pointing at us.

1:23:42.650 --> 1:23:44.080
-Oh.
-They're probably going

1:23:44.080 --> 1:23:45.180
damned straight.

1:23:45.180 --> 1:23:46.650
Look at all those old people
in a wagon.

1:23:50.690 --> 1:23:51.890
We're home.

1:23:51.890 --> 1:23:53.190
So, you guys like the car
or what?

1:23:53.190 --> 1:23:54.290
-Awesome.
-That is sweet.

1:23:54.290 --> 1:23:55.890
As far as
the marketing ploy goes,

1:23:55.890 --> 1:23:57.290
I couldn't have thought
of a better one.

1:23:57.290 --> 1:23:58.460
Well, I didn't think
of this one,

1:23:58.460 --> 1:24:00.000
barry did,
but he got gmg involved with

1:24:00.000 --> 1:24:02.030
"brady bunch" and hgtv.

1:24:02.030 --> 1:24:03.730
Maybe I'll hire him
as my new manager.

1:24:03.730 --> 1:24:05.870
Maureen: You guys did an amazing
job. Thank you.

1:24:05.870 --> 1:24:08.570
So we want to show you
what we've been working on.

1:24:08.570 --> 1:24:09.810
-Come on.
-Check this out.

1:24:09.810 --> 1:24:11.510
Richard: This is so wild getting
to see this in person.

1:24:11.510 --> 1:24:12.540
-Come to our house.
-Welcome.

1:24:12.540 --> 1:24:14.180
Get ready to
step into the '70s.

1:24:14.180 --> 1:24:17.550
Welcome to
a very brady house.

1:24:17.550 --> 1:24:19.180
Oh, my gosh.

1:24:19.180 --> 1:24:22.480
-That is so unbelievable.
-Isn't it awesome?

1:24:22.490 --> 1:24:24.350
Russell: Oh, my goodness.
