05:08.600 --> 05:10.200
and it was
kind of original looking,

on this car

05:26.390 --> 05:29.460

and do here.

it took for the car to transform

05:48.340 --> 05:51.910

fit into our time frame.

the showroom floor,

06:11.070 --> 06:15.670

because none of them are stock.

06:15.670 --> 06:19.040

you'd have to say this,

06:19.040 --> 06:21.340

did you do this?"

take you?"

all your builds?"

23:56.130 --> 23:59.370

23:59.370 --> 24:00.830
Yeah.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.200
Well, let's talk about what
can make this thing special.

24:02.200 --> 24:04.370
I'm thinking, you know,
get it down a little bit,

24:04.370 --> 24:06.640
give it a little attitude,
and I was thinking of maybe '70s

24:06.640 --> 24:08.110
side pipes.
That would be awesome.

24:08.110 --> 24:09.640
Russell: Great idea.
I mean really.

24:09.640 --> 24:11.180
So that means new tires
and new wheels?

24:11.180 --> 24:12.910
Oh, new tires, new wheels,
new suspension.

24:12.910 --> 24:14.250
New suspension, yeah.

24:14.250 --> 24:16.120
We're trying to go
as authentically as we can,

24:16.120 --> 24:19.390
so, like, the third-row seat,
that would be awesome.

24:19.390 --> 24:21.590
I mean, six kids.

24:21.590 --> 24:24.120
Barry wants a third-row seat.
I get it. I know why.

24:24.130 --> 24:26.390
There were six kids in there,
but he has no idea how hard

24:26.390 --> 24:28.260
it was to find the wagon
in the first place.

24:28.260 --> 24:29.530
Is it hard
to find the seats?

24:29.530 --> 24:31.660

near impossible.

kind of make it.

able to pull that off though,

put it over the top.

and an egg,

Before barry arrived,
I had the monkeys

24:59.160 --> 25:01.460

to form a course.

a turn in the '69

through the course

with the car

with an egg on it.

of the cone is a loser.

where the brake is.

hit the cone.

And I have a genius plan
for the rest of the car.

31:53.610 --> 31:54.970
Coy: Let's try rolling it
in the paint booth

31:54.980 --> 31:56.440
and putting it on bake.

31:56.440 --> 31:58.910
Stripping vinyl off the side
of a car is worse than removing

31:58.910 --> 32:00.650
a price sticker
from the sole of your shoe.

32:00.650 --> 32:02.750
Anybody got a roast,

32:02.750 --> 32:05.150
But here's what can make it
easier, some heat.

32:05.150 --> 32:08.120
The paint booth can be heated
as high as 160 degrees.

32:08.120 --> 32:10.220
I can't think of a better way
to spend

32:10.220 --> 32:15.390
the afternoon than peeling vinyl
in a hot bright box.

32:15.400 --> 32:16.760
Did I mention it was hot?

32:16.760 --> 32:19.300
It's hotter than the doghouse
on the "brady bunch" set,

32:19.300 --> 32:27.110

used to hang out and smooch.

32:27.110 --> 32:28.210
Why don't y'all come help me?

32:28.210 --> 32:31.140
Tony: Hell no,
look at yourself.

32:31.150 --> 32:32.540
-It's hot in there.
-You think?

32:32.550 --> 32:33.750
But it's coming off
really quick.

-I'm sure it is, but...
-It'd be nice to...

Just in case you were worried

32:42.120 --> 32:43.690
that we weren't having
enough fun,

32:43.690 --> 32:46.760
now we have to weld up all the
holes from the chrome trim.

32:46.760 --> 32:47.930
We only pulled the side trim.

32:47.930 --> 32:49.430
The rest of the trim is staying.

32:49.430 --> 32:52.800
I know I counted 54
just on this one side.

32:52.800 --> 32:54.770
Did you count the fenders?
I haven't counted the fenders.

32:54.770 --> 32:57.570
We got about 120, at least.
Yeah.

32:57.570 --> 33:01.170
I did some quick math, and if
each hole takes 10 minutes,

33:01.180 --> 33:02.810
that's 20 man-hours.

33:02.810 --> 33:04.040
Go get them, guys.

33:10.750 --> 33:12.420
That's way too dark.
Here we go.

33:12.420 --> 33:15.020
I think that's pretty close
to the original,

33:15.020 --> 33:18.690
but it just doesn't have
any kind of glow to it.

33:18.690 --> 33:24.660

a little bit more gold, g1423.

some attitude to it.
