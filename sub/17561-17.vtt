00:02.502 --> 00:03.961
The coast is clear.
Let's go! Come on!

00:04.045 --> 00:05.630
(Val)
I'm coming! I'm coming!

00:05.714 --> 00:07.674
I'm on the phone
with the wedding coordinator.

00:07.757 --> 00:09.384
Okay, sorry. Yes, okay.

00:09.467 --> 00:11.094
I will meet you
downstairs in five minutes.

00:11.177 --> 00:13.930
Okay. Let's go. Move it.
Move it. Move it. We gotta go!

00:14.013 --> 00:16.099
This is ridiculous.
You can't keep avoiding Vince.

00:16.181 --> 00:17.475
Sure I can, I've been
doing it for three days

00:17.559 --> 00:19.310
and I'm excellent at it.

00:19.394 --> 00:20.812
Well, you shouldn't be
excellent at it, okay?

00:20.895 --> 00:21.896
You have to deal with this.

00:21.980 --> 00:23.314
You have to say goodbye to him.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.066
What are you afraid of,
you're gonna cry?

00:25.150 --> 00:27.777
No. I'm afraid of him crying.
Now, let's go!

00:27.861 --> 00:30.613
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.281
The coast is clear.
Come on, let's go!

00:34.200 --> 00:35.368
Shh!

00:41.291 --> 00:43.793
[door slams]

00:43.877 --> 00:46.296
- Hi, Vince.
- A note?

00:46.379 --> 00:48.173
I'm moving to Chicago,
and you couldn't say

00:48.256 --> 00:49.549
goodbye in person?

00:49.632 --> 00:51.009
I could, but..

00:51.092 --> 00:53.344
Hallmark has a whole team
of trained professionals.

00:55.764 --> 00:58.767
Look, I have to go, Lauren's
treating us to a spa upstate

00:58.850 --> 01:00.560
for Val's wedding shower.

01:02.020 --> 01:03.813
Have fun in Chicago.

01:03.897 --> 01:07.650
With the Cubs and the great
hot dogs and the wind.

01:14.282 --> 01:16.534
Well, uh..

01:16.618 --> 01:19.120
I guess this is goodbye.

01:20.246 --> 01:21.873
I guess so.

01:27.921 --> 01:29.923
[sighs]

01:40.725 --> 01:42.185
Bye, Vince.

01:44.562 --> 01:46.397
Bye, Holly.

01:46.481 --> 01:48.525
[sniffling]

02:39.117 --> 02:41.661
Wait. My God, Lauren,
how many bags do you have?

02:41.744 --> 02:44.747
And why do they
smell like Fritos?

02:44.831 --> 02:46.624
Well, I packed
a few snacks. Mm-hmm.

02:46.708 --> 02:48.626
I know how these
health spas work.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.753
They get you all calm
and relaxed and then

02:50.837 --> 02:53.089
all you get to eat
is stuff that makes you poop.

02:55.508 --> 02:58.553
Before you go, Val, I'm gonna
need a decision on the cake.

02:58.636 --> 03:01.347
Oh, no, no, no,
I have turned all decisions

03:01.431 --> 03:02.724
over to my wedding coordinator

03:02.807 --> 03:04.851
and the man who, tomorrow,
will be my husband.

03:04.934 --> 03:07.645
Oh, listen to you,
going with the flow.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.772
Flowing with the go,
and I'm leaving.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.107
Okay, come on, ladies.

03:11.190 --> 03:12.191
- 'Bye.'
- 'Bye.'

03:12.275 --> 03:13.610
Okay, Vic, the cake.

03:13.693 --> 03:16.446
Milk chocolate with
raspberry or dark chocolate?

03:18.573 --> 03:19.741
Chocolate?

03:19.824 --> 03:21.576
- Oh, boy.
- Oh, boy.

03:21.659 --> 03:24.162
Um, well, you know, it's just,
it's a wedding cake.

03:24.245 --> 03:27.707
Isn't it traditional to do
it off-white buttercream?

03:27.790 --> 03:29.876
Val, if it isn't chocolate

03:29.959 --> 03:32.587
how are they going to know
it's Darth Vader?

03:34.380 --> 03:36.257
Darth? W-what's that?

03:36.341 --> 03:38.635
He's, uh, he-he's
Luke's father, baby.

03:40.386 --> 03:41.512
Yeah, I know who he is.

03:41.596 --> 03:43.473
W-what is he doing
at my wedding?

03:43.556 --> 03:46.476
Val, I told you, when we had
this last-minute cancellation

03:46.559 --> 03:48.645
for the room, it's too late
to the change the theme

03:48.728 --> 03:51.856
of the previous wedding,
"Star Wars."

03:53.149 --> 03:55.818
Okay, no, no. You said stars.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.195
- No.
- Yeah, yeah.

03:57.278 --> 03:59.155
And then I pictured
all the pretty twinkling lights

03:59.238 --> 04:01.157
you know, and then I was
so excited that we got the room

04:01.240 --> 04:02.533
and I started jumping up
and down, screaming and--

04:02.617 --> 04:05.161
Missed the part
when I said wars.

04:06.454 --> 04:07.413
Oh, my God.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.499
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Okay.

04:09.582 --> 04:11.000
[clears throat]

04:11.084 --> 04:13.962
How much is it gonna
cost to change this?

04:14.045 --> 04:15.838
Considering the wedding
is tomorrow

04:15.922 --> 04:17.839
we'd have to get a crew
to work around the clock

04:17.923 --> 04:19.384
on a Saturday.

04:19.466 --> 04:22.262
Uh, I'd have to say
a small fortune.

04:22.345 --> 04:26.516
Then I'd have to say,
"Star Wars" is awesome, huh?

04:26.599 --> 04:28.893
[imitating Yoda]
Hmm, lucky are we.

04:30.395 --> 04:34.190
Uh, Vic, we-we can't.
"Star Wars?"

04:34.274 --> 04:36.359
Okay, honey, come on, I know
it's not how you pictured it

04:36.442 --> 04:37.902
but nothing about
our relationship

04:37.986 --> 04:39.445
is how you pictured it.

04:39.529 --> 04:42.198
Well, baby, it's just that you
just get married once, you know?

04:42.281 --> 04:43.908
Ha! You don't.

04:43.992 --> 04:45.368
[laughs]

04:45.451 --> 04:48.496
[laughing]

04:50.206 --> 04:52.250
Look, come on, sweetie.
This is all superficial stuff.

04:52.333 --> 04:54.043
This wedding is about us, okay?

04:54.127 --> 04:56.087
You and me, that's all I see.

04:56.170 --> 05:00.508
Alright? Your face
and your eyes, your lips.

05:01.759 --> 05:03.678
- My neck.
- Your neck.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.223
Oh. Oh. Okay, okay, okay.

05:07.306 --> 05:10.059
You know, we got married
by Elvis the first time

05:10.143 --> 05:12.895
so what the hell? Why not Spock?

05:12.979 --> 05:16.649
- Spock was on "Star Trek."
- Bup-bup-bup!

05:16.733 --> 05:19.944
So, it's a go, Val, right?
So, let's go, Val.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.822
Come on, let's go,
let's go, let's go.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.616
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

05:25.700 --> 05:28.119
[chuckles]
Bye.

05:28.202 --> 05:30.496
Okay, this is so cool!

05:35.501 --> 05:37.503
Thanks.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.297
You know what I love, Tina?

05:39.380 --> 05:42.925
Everybody doing
everything for me.

05:43.009 --> 05:44.510
Wow, Vince just left for Chicago

05:44.594 --> 05:46.471
and you're all
peaceful and happy.

05:46.554 --> 05:47.555
It's weird.

05:47.638 --> 05:49.348
Well, Vince is moving

05:49.432 --> 05:51.601
he's got a new job, a new life.

05:51.684 --> 05:54.270
So I got to get up,
dust myself off

05:54.353 --> 05:57.023
and keep on, keep on!

05:58.733 --> 06:00.902
- Hey, Holly?
- Hmm?

06:00.985 --> 06:02.695
Don't do that.

06:03.571 --> 06:04.655
Okay.

06:07.408 --> 06:09.827
Wow. You seem
really calm, considering.

06:09.911 --> 06:12.371
Hmm, well, I'm at a spa

06:12.455 --> 06:14.290
wearing a comfy robe

06:14.373 --> 06:16.959
smelling lavender,
sipping ginger tea.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.294
What's not to be calm about?

06:18.377 --> 06:19.921
The fact that
there are gonna be androids

06:20.004 --> 06:22.507
passing out hors d'oeuvres
at your wedding tomorrow?

06:24.801 --> 06:26.803
Well, when you think
about it there is, uh

06:26.886 --> 06:28.846
something inherently romantic

06:28.930 --> 06:31.599
about science fiction.

06:31.682 --> 06:34.477
So, did you guys see
all the treatments they have?

06:34.560 --> 06:36.479
Salt scrubs, facials..

06:36.562 --> 06:38.314
Ooh-ooh, look at this one,
they whack you

06:38.397 --> 06:39.482
with giant eucalyptus leaves.

06:39.565 --> 06:40.608
Lauren, can I do that one?

06:40.691 --> 06:43.152
Hey, it's all-inclusive, okay?

06:43.236 --> 06:44.821
Get everything whacked.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.322
When you've selected
your treatments

06:46.405 --> 06:49.117
I'll just apply them
to the credit card on file.

06:49.200 --> 06:50.493
What?

06:50.576 --> 06:53.496
[chuckling]
Excuse me.

06:53.579 --> 06:56.749
Spa lady, Harmony.

06:56.833 --> 07:00.753
What was that about
applying what to my what?

07:00.837 --> 07:02.421
- The treatments.
- No.

07:02.505 --> 07:05.049
See, we are on
the all-inclusive plan.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.926
Yes, that includes the room

07:07.009 --> 07:08.678
unlimited use
of our hiking trails

07:08.761 --> 07:10.596
and meditation spaces

07:10.680 --> 07:12.765
and every day, you get a plum.

07:14.559 --> 07:16.185
So I have to pay extra for

07:16.269 --> 07:18.479
all the whacking and the salts?

07:18.563 --> 07:20.648
The plum is free.

07:20.731 --> 07:22.567
Crap.

07:22.650 --> 07:25.862
Oh, thank God,
I brought you, sweet lover!

07:27.822 --> 07:29.073
Do I smell chocolate?

07:29.157 --> 07:31.159
- No.
- It's a Twix.

07:31.242 --> 07:33.536
[sniffs]
No, Snickers.

07:34.745 --> 07:36.414
You are good!

07:36.497 --> 07:39.041
- Give me a bite.
- No!

07:39.125 --> 07:41.627
I'll give you 20 bucks
for the rest of that bar.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.633
Make it 30 bucks,
and you got yourself a deal.

07:49.468 --> 07:50.970
Hey.

07:51.053 --> 07:53.514
Are there others like you?

07:53.598 --> 07:55.266
Everywhere.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.103
Mmm.

07:59.187 --> 08:02.607
Ooh, this pineapple-coconut
lotion smells so nice..

08:02.690 --> 08:05.401
...I could eat my own arm.

08:05.484 --> 08:07.570
- Where's my bracelet?
- What bracelet?

08:07.653 --> 08:09.363
The one that Vince gave me,
it was on my wrist.

08:09.447 --> 08:10.948
Well, I'm sure you
took it off when you changed.

08:11.032 --> 08:12.909
Oh, yeah. It's probably
in my robe pocket.

08:12.992 --> 08:14.160
[chuckles]

08:14.243 --> 08:17.079
It is not in my robe pocket.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.623
Where could I have put it? Move.

08:18.706 --> 08:21.250
- Ow.
- Okay.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.710
Wait. Where is it?

08:22.793 --> 08:24.253
I can't find it.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.631
Oh, maybe it's in my sleeve.

08:30.635 --> 08:32.553
Yeah, Holly,
you're going kind of crazy

08:32.636 --> 08:33.511
over a little bracelet.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.264
It is not a little bracelet.

08:35.347 --> 08:37.933
Vince gave it to me.
It was a gift. I want it back.

08:38.017 --> 08:40.102
Okay, well, we'll get it back.

08:40.186 --> 08:41.354
Just calm down, alright?

08:41.437 --> 08:42.938
Everybody needs
to just stay calm.

08:43.022 --> 08:45.274
It's easy for you to say.
It was my bracelet.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.609
Honey, you know what?

08:46.692 --> 08:48.152
I came here to relax

08:48.236 --> 08:49.820
to sort of, you know, unwind

08:49.904 --> 08:51.072
release my tension.

08:51.155 --> 08:54.075
Then sit on a hot rock.
I lost my bracelet.

08:54.158 --> 08:55.910
Okay, so, you know what?
I'll buy you a new one.

08:55.993 --> 08:57.245
I don't want a new one.

08:57.328 --> 08:59.205
- I want that one.
- Oh, really?

08:59.288 --> 09:00.706
Well, I'm sorry, but, sometimes

09:00.790 --> 09:02.124
we don't get
what we want in life.

09:02.208 --> 09:04.043
Yeah, sometimes, we even
get what we don't want

09:04.126 --> 09:07.630
like a wedding in a galaxy
far, far away.

09:07.713 --> 09:10.466
Vince gave me that bracelet,
and now he's gone!

09:10.549 --> 09:11.884
He was my baby!

09:11.968 --> 09:14.595
I'm gonna be cutting my
wedding cake with a lightsaber!

09:20.518 --> 09:21.894
God, I wish Robyn would
get here right now.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.646
I'm so nervous
to tell her I'm quitting.

09:23.729 --> 09:26.315
Hey, man, since you're moving
to Chicago tomorrow

09:26.399 --> 09:27.817
I got a little something
for you.

09:27.900 --> 09:29.193
Oh, Gary, you didn't have to.

09:29.277 --> 09:30.319
Bam!

09:32.363 --> 09:33.990
Gary, that's your favorite mug.

09:34.073 --> 09:35.866
What are you gonna drink
out of in the morning?

09:35.950 --> 09:37.076
Bam!

09:39.078 --> 09:41.205
You and me, baby. You and me.

09:41.289 --> 09:42.540
Hey, Vin.

09:46.043 --> 09:47.169
What's so important?

09:47.253 --> 09:49.630
[clears throat]
Um, Robyn, let me just start

09:49.714 --> 09:51.382
by saying you're incredible.

09:51.465 --> 09:54.218
You taught me so much.
You-you gave me my start.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.887
You've done so much for me.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.015
But the thing is..

09:59.098 --> 10:01.517
...I want more.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.060
Fantastic.

10:06.063 --> 10:08.816
- What are you doing?
- I want more too.

10:08.899 --> 10:11.360
Wait, wait, wait, Robyn, whoa.

10:11.444 --> 10:14.530
I wanted you ever since
the first day I met you.

10:14.613 --> 10:15.698
I was just being a lady about it

10:15.781 --> 10:18.367
so I waited
till you two broke up.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.910
Oh, my God. Holly was right.

10:19.994 --> 10:22.997
[chuckles]
I can't believe
you never got it.

10:23.080 --> 10:25.041
I gave you every sign

10:25.124 --> 10:27.335
but maybe I was too subtle.

10:30.838 --> 10:33.507
- I'm quitting.
- What?

10:33.591 --> 10:35.217
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.595
Brown and Whitman offered me
a job, and I took it.

10:37.678 --> 10:41.182
You backstabbing jerk.
I made you!

10:41.265 --> 10:44.477
I taught you everything,
and you used me to get ahead!

10:44.560 --> 10:45.728
Can't believe
I didn't listen to Holly.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.021
I can't believe I trusted you.

10:47.104 --> 10:48.856
- God, I'm so stupid!
- Yeah, you are.

10:48.939 --> 10:50.316
And you know what would
really make me mad?

10:50.399 --> 10:52.526
If you made out
with me right now!

10:53.944 --> 10:56.447
- What?
- Meh, it was worth a shot.

11:03.829 --> 11:06.749
You tell your friends,
first taste is free!

11:06.832 --> 11:08.292
Let's go. Thanks.

11:12.755 --> 11:14.090
Val, what are you doing?

11:14.173 --> 11:16.550
I can't get reception
anywhere. I got zero bars.

11:16.634 --> 11:19.178
I have to call Vic and tell him
the "Star Wars" wedding is off.

11:19.261 --> 11:22.098
Val, wait. Come on. Everything's
gonna be fine. I promise..

11:22.181 --> 11:24.183
What? No, sister!

11:24.266 --> 11:26.268
Cash only. You think
I want a paper trail?

11:26.352 --> 11:28.104
Get out of here!

11:28.187 --> 11:30.815
Where did she go?
She was right here!

11:32.233 --> 11:35.236
Okay, please, you-you have
to have an office phone.

11:35.319 --> 11:37.988
I'm sorry, but here, we believe
part of freeing your mind

11:38.072 --> 11:40.533
is freeing yourself
of technology.

11:40.616 --> 11:42.827
No phone, no radios,
no computer.

11:42.910 --> 11:46.288
Okay, you have to have a phone.
Wh-what if there's an emergency?

11:46.372 --> 11:49.708
What, you send it out
to the universe?

11:49.792 --> 11:52.002
Oh, God, you do.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.213
Perhaps a peaceful ride
on one of our gentle horses

11:54.296 --> 11:56.382
will calm your troubled mind.

11:56.465 --> 11:58.467
Our trails go for miles.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.303
Miles, a-as into a service area?

12:01.387 --> 12:03.514
I mean, serving area?

12:11.605 --> 12:14.650
No, don't stop.
Come on. Giddy up.

12:14.733 --> 12:16.944
[whistling]

12:17.027 --> 12:18.487
Please, Wildfire,
come on, please.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.240
I got zero bars.
I just need some reception.

12:24.410 --> 12:26.328
Okay, you know what?

12:26.412 --> 12:28.789
I am gonna, whoa! Okay.

12:28.873 --> 12:32.334
I am gonna appeal to you,
woman to woman, alright?

12:32.418 --> 12:34.420
Yeah, we're good.

12:34.503 --> 12:35.796
Would you want
a "Star Wars" wedding?

12:35.880 --> 12:37.339
I mean, come on.

12:37.423 --> 12:41.594
Say you and, uh,
Seabiscuit got engaged

12:41.677 --> 12:44.513
and you want
a beautiful, romantic..

12:44.597 --> 12:46.348
Oh, God. I'm talking to a horse.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.350
I'm losing my mind.

12:56.275 --> 12:57.526
What the hell is wrong with you?

12:57.610 --> 12:58.903
What are you doing here?

12:58.986 --> 13:01.155
Finding out what the hell
is wrong with you.

13:01.238 --> 13:02.907
You're canceling
a wedding with a guy

13:02.990 --> 13:05.993
you're totally in love with
because of the decorations?

13:06.076 --> 13:07.912
Don't you see
how ridiculous that is?

13:07.995 --> 13:09.205
Yes, I do!

13:09.288 --> 13:11.415
Then why are you doing it?

13:11.499 --> 13:14.502
I don't know, okay?
I don't know!

13:14.585 --> 13:16.712
Oh, Val.

13:16.795 --> 13:18.547
I don't know, Lauren, okay?

13:18.631 --> 13:21.133
Maybe I am just
not meant to be happy.

13:21.217 --> 13:22.635
Well, who the hell
told you that?

13:22.718 --> 13:24.136
What do you mean
who told me that?

13:24.220 --> 13:25.763
The universe told me that,
that's who, I mean..

13:25.846 --> 13:27.389
Every time something
good comes my way

13:27.473 --> 13:29.934
every time, there is a flaw.

13:30.017 --> 13:32.436
Or do you look for a flaw?

13:32.520 --> 13:35.105
No, I did not look
for a "Star Wars" wedding.

13:35.189 --> 13:36.565
No, but you sure
looked for a way

13:36.649 --> 13:38.234
to be miserable about it.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.236
Did you ever think
that maybe the universe

13:40.319 --> 13:41.695
is trying to send you a message

13:41.779 --> 13:43.906
with this whole
"Star Wars" thing?

13:43.989 --> 13:47.618
Stop looking for the dark side,
Miss Darth Vader.

13:48.577 --> 13:50.371
Do I do that?

13:50.454 --> 13:52.581
I do do that.

13:52.665 --> 13:55.251
Oh, God. Why do I do that?

13:55.334 --> 13:57.711
Why-why do I always
look for a problem?

13:57.795 --> 13:59.129
I mean, if you were doing it,
I would say, "Lauren

13:59.213 --> 14:00.256
"what the hell
is wrong with you?

14:00.339 --> 14:01.674
"Why are you being
such an idiot?

14:01.757 --> 14:05.302
Why are you making
yourself unhappy?"

14:05.386 --> 14:07.555
Oh, God.

14:07.638 --> 14:09.265
I'm the idiot.

14:09.348 --> 14:13.102
Oh. It's not the universe
making me unhappy, it's me.

14:13.185 --> 14:15.437
I-I'm making myself unhappy.

14:15.521 --> 14:17.856
Oh, my God.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.401
Lauren, you know what,
I don't think

14:20.484 --> 14:21.819
it's the first time
I've done it.

14:21.902 --> 14:24.530
- Really?
- Mm-hmm. No.

14:24.613 --> 14:27.241
I think I have been
doing it my whole life.

14:27.324 --> 14:29.952
- Well, that's crazy.
- Isn't it?

14:30.035 --> 14:32.454
I mean, the thing about it
is, I don't have to do it.

14:32.538 --> 14:35.708
I mean, I can choose
to be happy. It's so simple.

14:35.791 --> 14:38.586
Oh, my God.
I lived my whole life like..

14:38.669 --> 14:41.130
[gasps]
Oh, no, Lauren..

14:41.213 --> 14:42.631
...do you think
I've made Holly this way?

14:42.715 --> 14:46.051
Oh, hell, no. Okay?
She is the exact opposite.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.304
She acts happy
when she's really sad.

14:48.387 --> 14:50.431
- Well, that's sick.
- Yeah.

14:50.514 --> 14:52.933
You're both totally screwed up.

14:53.017 --> 14:54.643
Hey, now that I've cured you

14:54.727 --> 14:57.313
maybe you should go pay it
forward and help Holly.

14:57.396 --> 15:00.608
Yes. You are right.
That is what I should do.

15:00.691 --> 15:02.318
You know what,
this horseback-riding

15:02.401 --> 15:04.486
thing's been so enlightening, I
think I'll take her for a ride.

15:04.570 --> 15:08.741
Or, you know, maybe
a nice free freeing hike.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.036
- Maybe.
- Okay. You go.

15:14.622 --> 15:17.374
[instrumental music]

15:25.132 --> 15:26.717
Holly, I don't think
you're gonna find your bracelet

15:26.800 --> 15:28.177
in the Zen Garden.

15:28.260 --> 15:31.096
Harmony said I could find
what I was looking for in here.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.183
I think she meant enlightenment.

15:34.266 --> 15:36.518
Ohh! It's not in there!

15:36.602 --> 15:39.355
Oh, I've looked everywhere.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.440
It's gone.

15:41.523 --> 15:43.442
I lost my "Vincelet."

15:45.069 --> 15:48.530
Yes, you did lose your bracelet.

15:48.614 --> 15:51.909
Is there anything
you need to do?

15:51.992 --> 15:53.202
No.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.749
You lost your bracelet, Holly.

15:58.832 --> 16:01.960
It is gone, gone forever.

16:02.044 --> 16:02.920
Mm-hmm.

16:03.003 --> 16:04.463
First, the love of your life

16:04.546 --> 16:05.839
breaks your heart

16:05.923 --> 16:07.966
now a beautiful memory

16:08.050 --> 16:09.885
you had of him
has disappeared. Who knows?

16:09.968 --> 16:13.722
Maybe some other girl's
wearing that bracelet right now.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.684
Why are you
being all mean? I'm sad.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.978
Yes, and you should be sad,
because it is over.

16:20.062 --> 16:22.398
He is gone, and he has
left a big old hole

16:22.481 --> 16:24.066
right here in your heart.

16:24.149 --> 16:26.902
I know. It's a really big hole.

16:28.654 --> 16:30.656
[sobbing]

16:34.618 --> 16:37.121
What? No. No, don't stop.

16:37.204 --> 16:38.706
Keep it going.
You were doing so good. Come on.

16:38.789 --> 16:40.541
Don't make me say
any more mean things to you.

16:40.624 --> 16:41.875
What?

16:41.959 --> 16:44.336
Holly, you've got to cry, okay?
You got to let it out.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.588
It's the only thing that's gonna
make you feel any better, okay?

16:46.672 --> 16:48.090
Now, cry. Come on, cry!

16:48.173 --> 16:50.592
- Cry me a river, baby! Cry!
- I don't wanna cry.

16:50.676 --> 16:51.844
I don't like crying.

16:51.927 --> 16:53.220
It makes my eyes all puffy

16:53.303 --> 16:56.432
and my nose all red and..

16:56.515 --> 16:58.851
I have trouble breathing

16:58.934 --> 17:01.311
and I have a hard time

17:01.395 --> 17:03.272
getting my words out!

17:03.355 --> 17:05.148
See?

17:05.232 --> 17:07.443
[sobbing]

17:09.486 --> 17:11.571
Don't I look like crap?

17:11.655 --> 17:14.407
Yes, you do. You look like hell.

17:20.539 --> 17:21.790
So, Robyn tried to kiss you?

17:21.874 --> 17:24.585
And cop a feel.

17:24.667 --> 17:25.836
Hussy.

17:27.087 --> 17:28.672
Can you believe it?
Holly was right.

17:28.756 --> 17:31.341
Well, that's great, man, see,
now you can apologize to her

17:31.425 --> 17:32.926
she'll forgive you,
and you can stay.

17:33.010 --> 17:34.303
First of all,
she won't forgive me

17:34.386 --> 17:35.888
and I got a job in Chicago.

17:35.971 --> 17:37.347
Well, how can she
not forgive you?

17:37.431 --> 17:39.433
Because what I did
was so horrible.

17:39.516 --> 17:41.769
I didn't believe her.
I broke our trust.

17:41.852 --> 17:42.895
What can I possibly say?

17:42.978 --> 17:45.105
Look, just speak
from your heart, okay?

17:45.189 --> 17:48.317
Just say, "Holly," go ahead.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.903
- She's not gonna--
- "Holly, I.."

17:52.154 --> 17:54.990
Holly, I'm really sorry.

17:55.073 --> 17:56.742
About what, Vince?

18:00.287 --> 18:02.289
What are you doing?

18:02.372 --> 18:04.666
I'm being Holly, you know,
so you can be prepared

18:04.750 --> 18:06.001
you don't get thrown off.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.377
Now, continue.

18:07.461 --> 18:08.837
"I'm sorry."

18:08.921 --> 18:11.548
Um, Holly.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.008
You were right about Robyn.

18:13.091 --> 18:14.843
I-I never should have
doubted you. I don't know.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.887
Maybe it was
the excitement of the new job

18:16.970 --> 18:18.263
that my judgment
was all clouded.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.474
So, what you're saying is

18:20.557 --> 18:23.727
that if Robyn
never told you the truth..

18:23.811 --> 18:26.188
[chuckles]

18:26.271 --> 18:28.524
...that you'd still be
believing Robyn?

18:28.607 --> 18:29.900
That's great. That's great.

18:29.983 --> 18:31.360
She's the only reason
you believe me now.

18:31.443 --> 18:33.320
- But I--
- And not because you love me.

18:33.403 --> 18:36.698
Or trust me or respect me
or know in your heart

18:36.782 --> 18:39.910
that I would never make up
something so ridiculous.

18:41.245 --> 18:43.705
I would never do something
like that to someone I love.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.083
Oh, God, Vince, how I loved you.

18:48.377 --> 18:51.964
You were my soul mate,
the love of my life.

18:52.047 --> 18:54.174
I gave you my womanhood!

18:58.136 --> 19:00.639
Oh, snap. My damn, man.
Oh, my damn.

19:00.722 --> 19:02.558
I-I-I'm sorry, man.

19:02.641 --> 19:03.767
I-I-I didn't know
where it came from.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.894
I didn't mean it.

19:05.978 --> 19:09.147
Yeah, you did.
Holly feels the same way.

19:09.231 --> 19:12.943
I don't blame her.
I blew it, man.

19:13.026 --> 19:15.195
I'm going upstairs to pack.

19:19.616 --> 19:21.702
What have I done?

19:28.458 --> 19:30.711
I had so much fun.
That was perfect.

19:30.794 --> 19:32.087
Oh, hello, Harmony.

19:32.170 --> 19:34.298
Should we put your balance
on your credit card?

19:34.381 --> 19:36.592
No, I work in cash.
There you go.

19:38.218 --> 19:40.262
Lauren, thank you so much
for my spa getaway.

19:40.345 --> 19:43.098
You, I am so lucky to
have you as my best friend.

19:43.182 --> 19:46.268
And you, I am lucky
to have for my sister.

19:46.351 --> 19:49.855
And, Tina, you, great shoes.

19:50.981 --> 19:53.775
- Thirteen bucks.
- Oh. Wow.

19:53.859 --> 19:57.321
Val, thank you for making me
feel so horrible.

19:57.404 --> 19:59.823
I feel so much better!

19:59.907 --> 20:02.034
Good. So do I. I feel great.

20:02.117 --> 20:05.412
And tonight at 6 o'clock,
I am gonna be Mrs. Val

20:05.495 --> 20:07.789
"Calm not looking
for flaws anymore." Mela..

20:07.873 --> 20:10.000
Oh, God,
where's my wedding dress?

20:10.083 --> 20:11.501
It's in the car with
the rest of the luggage.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.587
Now, let's do it!

20:13.670 --> 20:14.796
Whoa! Excuse me.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.715
Sorry, we're doing
a house-to-house search

20:16.798 --> 20:18.508
looking for two
escaped convicts.

20:18.592 --> 20:21.553
Nobody leaves.
Officers, check the back.

20:21.637 --> 20:22.971
Nobody le.. Did he just
say, "Nobody leaves?"

20:23.055 --> 20:24.306
That's what he said.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.934
Um, excuse me, um, officer, hi.

20:27.017 --> 20:29.144
I can't stay here. I have
to get to a wedding, mine.

20:29.227 --> 20:31.980
Oh, congratulations.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.982
Excuse me. How long are we
gonna have to stay here?

20:34.066 --> 20:36.151
