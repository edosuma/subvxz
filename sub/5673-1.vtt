WEBVTT

00:32.850 --> 00:35.405
BEASTLY

01:22.080 --> 01:24.105
And the next candidate
for Buckston High School

01:24.182 --> 01:26.810
Green Committee President,
Kyle Kingson.

01:34.292 --> 01:36.123
True or false...

01:37.195 --> 01:41.131
You are an aggressively
unattractive person.

01:41.199 --> 01:44.828
Hatchet face, face-ache,
face like burnt Lego?

01:46.204 --> 01:49.037
Or did you only
just miss the beautiful.

01:49.407 --> 01:53.434
Any which way,
best embrace the suck.

01:53.911 --> 01:55.344
Beautiful people
get it better.

01:56.114 --> 01:58.344
That's just the way it is.

02:07.058 --> 02:11.462
So... what does this
got to do

02:11.465 --> 02:13.327
with running for
Green Committee President?

02:14.365 --> 02:16.799
Not much. Except...

02:17.368 --> 02:20.496
you'll never elect me 'cause of
my commitment to the environment.

02:21.372 --> 02:24.500
I don't have one.
I want this for my transcript.

02:24.976 --> 02:26.409
But what you got to ask
yourselves is,

02:26.477 --> 02:30.208
should you vote for me just
because I'm the rich, popular,

02:30.882 --> 02:33.715
good-looking guy
with the famous dad?

02:34.685 --> 02:37.017
And the answer is,
hell yes.

03:00.811 --> 03:03.177
Palm of your hand, man,
palm of your hand.

03:03.247 --> 03:05.374
Stellar Angels
in America essay.

03:05.449 --> 03:08.475
I appreciate all the extra time
you spent with me, Mr. Bernstein.

03:08.953 --> 03:10.079
You hate that teacher's guts.

03:10.154 --> 03:12.384
Whatever it takes,
'til the college recs are in.

03:12.456 --> 03:13.889
Speech killed.

03:13.958 --> 03:16.791
Speaking of killing, you see that
ball-biting, voodoo-tatted slut.

03:16.861 --> 03:18.988
But really, who gives?
Stick to my mantra,

03:19.063 --> 03:20.291
steer clear of the witch.

03:20.364 --> 03:22.389
I'll put it out of
your head later.

03:26.470 --> 03:27.596
What the...

03:39.984 --> 03:41.008
Maybe it's just me,

03:41.085 --> 03:42.814
but shouldn't whoever runs
the Green Committee

03:42.887 --> 03:44.514
actually care
about things green?

03:46.691 --> 03:49.626
Or be green, like the rest of
your facially disabled coven?

03:49.694 --> 03:51.127
Throw it to someone deserving.

03:51.696 --> 03:53.027
Lindy Taylor's only going
for Treasurer

03:53.097 --> 03:54.826
because she knew she couldn't
win President against you.

03:54.899 --> 03:55.729
No, no, no. I...

03:55.800 --> 03:58.826
But I think we're all hoping that
in the privacy of the voting booth

03:58.903 --> 04:02.066
your bandwagoneers will stop
fearing for their social lives

04:02.139 --> 04:03.868
and make the right choice.

04:04.342 --> 04:06.173
And might I just add

04:06.844 --> 04:09.870
looks are important to you.

04:10.248 --> 04:11.681
They're important to everyone.

04:11.749 --> 04:13.376
Except you, clearly.

04:19.156 --> 04:22.387
Appreciate the smear campaign
and kudos to you and

04:22.960 --> 04:24.894
your bitchcrafty friend
for staging a little coup,

04:24.962 --> 04:26.395
but if you wanted Prez,
you shoulda had...

04:26.464 --> 04:28.091
Actually, I don't want Prez,

04:28.165 --> 04:30.690
I don't know Kendra and
I don't let others speak for me.

04:30.768 --> 04:34.295
But maybe that's just me being
the defensive scholarship kid. So,

04:34.372 --> 04:35.600
best of luck tomorrow.

04:36.073 --> 04:38.906
And it's nice to finally meet you
after three years.

05:00.598 --> 05:01.530
How are you?

05:02.933 --> 05:03.865
Not bad.

05:08.139 --> 05:09.265
Elections today.

05:09.640 --> 05:10.572
Great.

05:11.342 --> 05:13.071
No, not you.
I was talking to my son.

05:13.144 --> 05:15.578
- Did us proud.
- Yeah, all right.

05:16.047 --> 05:17.981
Experimented with fireworks too.

05:18.049 --> 05:21.883
Terrific. Uh, wait, hold on.
Jill, I got to go.

05:22.253 --> 05:25.086
Hey, I'm sorry, Jill got canned.

05:25.856 --> 05:28.086
Yeah, it's probably the way
the baby ten looked on camera.

05:28.759 --> 05:31.091
And she's a big-boned girl
to begin with.

05:31.462 --> 05:33.396
People like people
who look good.

05:33.464 --> 05:36.092
Anyone who says otherwise
is dumb or ugly.

05:38.169 --> 05:40.296
- Who's Jill?
- I told you about her.

05:40.371 --> 05:41.395
I don't think so.

05:42.173 --> 05:44.004
And I know this because
the last time we had a conversation

05:44.075 --> 05:46.305
that lasted more than five minutes
was sophomore year.

05:46.377 --> 05:48.902
I hear you. Why don't you
leave me alone?

05:48.979 --> 05:51.413
When I told you
I had brain cancer.

05:58.589 --> 06:02.650
And? Oh, shoot.
Hang on.

06:02.727 --> 06:03.659
Rob Kingson.

06:12.236 --> 06:13.168
What?

06:13.537 --> 06:16.563
Nothing. I say good night.

06:16.640 --> 06:19.268
Why, 'cause you need to get home
to your sixteen children?

06:19.343 --> 06:22.574
My three children live in Jamaica
with their father, which you know.

06:23.647 --> 06:24.978
Do me a favor.

06:25.649 --> 06:26.877
Save the sob stories

06:26.951 --> 06:29.283
for your heart-to-hearts
with Mr. Clean.

06:29.954 --> 06:31.387
You no vex me,

06:31.756 --> 06:33.087
you stoosh ginnygog.

06:34.558 --> 06:38.494
And next year's president,
Kyle Kingson.

06:49.173 --> 06:51.698
Josh Black, please report
to the principal's office.

06:56.580 --> 06:58.912
Don't think it was a landslide,
if it makes you feel better.

06:58.983 --> 06:59.915
And... and I'm sorry.

06:59.984 --> 07:01.417
Is bullshit one word or two?

07:01.485 --> 07:02.952
No, it's not...
And I want to make it up to you.

07:03.020 --> 07:05.648
I get two Green Party VIP passes.

07:05.723 --> 07:09.250
Scores you greenroom access,
that kinda thing. Want one?

07:11.028 --> 07:13.553
- What's the catch?
- No catch.

07:13.631 --> 07:16.657
- So I'd be like,
going with you? - Yeah.

07:17.435 --> 07:18.367
What about your girl friend?

07:18.736 --> 07:21.068
Deep-fried Barbie doll,
she dumped me last night.

07:21.138 --> 07:23.663
Hey, I don't know
what game this is, but I'll play.

07:23.741 --> 07:24.466
Really?

07:24.542 --> 07:26.876
Everyone deserves
a second chance.

07:26.944 --> 07:30.277
Besides, you know what
they say about me, don't you?

07:30.648 --> 07:32.081
Vicious gossip.

07:32.149 --> 07:35.175
And only idiots
screw with witches.

07:36.153 --> 07:37.279
Careful now.

07:50.067 --> 07:52.001
Tell me you did not
get a cheap-ass rose.

07:52.770 --> 07:54.294
Them no have the orchid.

07:54.371 --> 07:55.395
They didn't have it?

07:55.473 --> 07:57.202
I told you two weeks ago
to order it.

07:57.274 --> 07:59.003
You tell me yesterday,

08:00.177 --> 08:01.201
But listen.

08:03.914 --> 08:07.645
"A symbol of humility,
the white rose also say,

08:07.718 --> 08:10.346
'I am loyal
and worthy of you.'"

08:17.528 --> 08:19.052
WTF(What tje fuck)?

08:19.430 --> 08:21.261
And it also means
I am loyal and worthy of you.

08:21.332 --> 08:22.959
- Go blow a goat.
- I'm sorry.

08:23.033 --> 08:24.466
The orchid was
this year's yellow ribbon.

08:24.535 --> 08:25.968
It was a political statement.

08:26.036 --> 08:28.766
Thanks for making me
look like an insensitive bitch.

08:34.445 --> 08:35.776
I mean does it suck so bad?

08:36.146 --> 08:38.376
No, it's... badass.

08:42.353 --> 08:44.378
Did I ever congratulate you
on treasurer?

08:44.455 --> 08:48.289
I probably never apologized for
my aholian election behavior either.

08:48.359 --> 08:50.088
Well... two weeks ago
was the first and last time

08:50.160 --> 08:51.286
you spoke to me
in three years.

08:51.362 --> 08:52.795
So, um... no.

08:53.264 --> 08:56.097
Sorry on all counts.

08:56.467 --> 08:57.491
Got to slave here
all night?

08:57.568 --> 08:58.796
Slaving all year.

08:58.869 --> 08:59.801
Work-study?

08:59.870 --> 09:02.338
Yeah. I'm saving
for the Machu Picchu trip.

09:03.007 --> 09:04.634
But my shift's almost over.

09:04.708 --> 09:06.232
Just in time
for the real fun.

09:06.310 --> 09:07.641
Yeah, right.

09:07.711 --> 09:09.838
She blows it off.
Too cool for school?

09:10.214 --> 09:11.545
Definitely not. Just...

09:11.615 --> 09:13.048
Not your thing.

09:13.417 --> 09:16.352
That, and... well, that.

09:17.521 --> 09:19.853
What can I say?
I'm substance over style.

09:19.924 --> 09:21.255
A dying breed.

09:21.325 --> 09:22.758
It's never too late
to join.

09:22.826 --> 09:24.760
Think I already drank
the kool-aid.

09:25.129 --> 09:26.255
Always hope.

09:29.533 --> 09:31.763
- Take a picture with me.
- What?

09:32.736 --> 09:33.964
School newspaper.

09:38.442 --> 09:40.467
But I'll need to approve it
before it runs.

09:41.145 --> 09:42.077
Hold up.

09:43.147 --> 09:44.876
- What else'll I do with it?
- "I'm worthy of you."

09:45.649 --> 09:46.581
What?

09:48.152 --> 09:50.177
What white roses mean.

09:51.255 --> 09:52.779
Lamecore, I know.

09:52.856 --> 09:55.689
And obviously not what I,
uh, thought you meant.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.484
No, it's just...

10:34.798 --> 10:36.026
See you later.

10:36.100 --> 10:37.431
Don't be a stranger.

10:38.402 --> 10:40.632
- What's with her?
- Pity mack.

10:41.605 --> 10:44.335
Cause you got a flesh-eater
at 4 o'clock.

10:45.209 --> 10:48.337
And here we go.

10:52.516 --> 10:54.746
You actually bought it.

10:54.818 --> 10:56.547
You bought that
I'd hook up with you

10:57.121 --> 11:00.352
the self-mutilated,
tatted Frankenskank

11:00.424 --> 11:04.087
who publicly humiliated me,
almost cost me the election?

11:04.161 --> 11:05.685
No dice, sunshine.

11:06.363 --> 11:09.389
But hey, you can buy a ticket.

11:10.167 --> 11:12.397
Or here's a secret.

11:12.469 --> 11:15.495
Sometimes they let you
in just 'cause you're eye candy.

11:16.373 --> 11:17.601
She eye-candy?

11:17.975 --> 11:19.909
Rules are
she needs a ticket.

11:20.878 --> 11:23.608
Ah well, que sera, sera.

11:23.681 --> 11:27.310
Spanish for sucks to be
an ugly cow.

11:28.085 --> 11:30.610
I only came to give you
a second chance.

11:31.088 --> 11:32.817
- Guess I blew it.
- I guess so.

11:32.890 --> 11:33.822
But Kyle?

11:35.092 --> 11:37.720
Best embrace the suck.

12:15.165 --> 12:18.293
Relax. Kyle,
I already forgave you. Come on.

12:19.570 --> 12:21.697
God, you're sweating like a pig.

12:25.876 --> 12:27.400
You see the way
she looked at me?

12:27.478 --> 12:28.410
So what?

12:29.279 --> 12:30.303
- I got to go.
- Kyle.

13:11.555 --> 13:12.988
How are you feeling, Kyle?

13:14.458 --> 13:18.189
Kendra? What're you doing here?

13:18.262 --> 13:21.698
I'm here for everyone
who just missed the beauty boat.

13:22.266 --> 13:23.198
What?

13:23.467 --> 13:26.402
And all the self-mutilating,
tatted Frankenskanks.

13:26.470 --> 13:27.596
It was a joke.

13:28.672 --> 13:29.798
I didn't get it.

13:30.174 --> 13:32.802
But pretty soon, you will.

13:33.277 --> 13:35.905
You have a year to find
someone to love you.

13:36.580 --> 13:38.707
Before the tree blooms again.

13:41.485 --> 13:43.919
When the spring flowers bloom
again, the year is up,

13:46.290 --> 13:49.817
And either the words "I love you"
will release you from the spell

13:50.394 --> 13:52.828
or stay like this forever.

13:52.896 --> 13:53.828
Like what?

13:57.301 --> 13:58.233
No!

14:03.240 --> 14:04.468
No!

14:06.743 --> 14:07.675
No!

14:10.247 --> 14:14.183
As aggressively unattractive
outside as you are inside.

14:14.251 --> 14:15.183
Wait!

14:17.254 --> 14:20.087
You have a year
to find someone to love you.

14:21.258 --> 14:25.285
Or stay like this forever.

14:50.087 --> 14:51.019
Dad.

14:52.189 --> 14:53.417
Jesus, you scared me.

14:53.490 --> 14:55.014
Don't turn on the light.

14:56.293 --> 14:58.022
- Why?
- Please.

14:58.495 --> 15:00.429
What's going on?

15:01.198 --> 15:02.256
Why do you love me?

15:02.933 --> 15:04.457
Kind of a question is that?

15:04.534 --> 15:07.059
- Just answer it.
- Because you're my son.

15:07.738 --> 15:10.969
But do you believe
in magic?

15:11.041 --> 15:12.668
Magic?
What the hell are you...

15:18.348 --> 15:19.280
Kyle?

15:21.952 --> 15:24.079
His vision and hearing.

15:24.655 --> 15:25.986
That's all you've got?

15:26.056 --> 15:30.993
And, of course, his insides are just
as normal as... as they were before,

15:31.061 --> 15:33.586
but the skin won't change
no matter what we do.

15:33.664 --> 15:36.189
Now, what about skin grafts
or face transplants?

15:36.266 --> 15:39.292
I mean, look at him,
look at him.

15:40.570 --> 15:42.697
He doesn't want to live life
looking like this.

15:42.773 --> 15:44.104
We'd risk anything.

15:44.574 --> 15:45.506
What?

15:49.279 --> 15:51.110
Kyle, we are going to
find somebody else.

15:51.181 --> 15:52.910
I'm not taking
"no" from Dr. Crap-for-Brains.

15:52.983 --> 15:54.109
We will fix this.

15:54.184 --> 15:56.516
Yes, because we'd risk anything,
including me dying.

15:56.586 --> 15:58.816
No, no, that's not what I meant.
It just came out that way.

15:59.389 --> 16:01.414
Or did it come out
because that is what you meant?

16:02.926 --> 16:03.858
No.

16:11.635 --> 16:13.660
Come on.
I have a surprise for you.

16:18.342 --> 16:19.570
What do you think, Kyle?

16:20.744 --> 16:22.871
It's private, safe.

16:22.946 --> 16:25.176
People can't be spying
all the time.

16:25.349 --> 16:27.425
Plus, I'm thinking I might
get you that motorcycle

16:27.430 --> 16:28.376
you've always wanted.

16:32.356 --> 16:33.482
Where's your room?

16:34.758 --> 16:35.986
It's right across the hall.

16:36.860 --> 16:40.387
Don't worry. I will take care of
whatever you need.

16:42.366 --> 16:43.697
Still need to get my stuff.

16:46.970 --> 16:50.201
But we're keeping
the place in the city?

16:52.275 --> 16:54.800
So I can crash there late nights
if need be.

16:59.082 --> 17:00.014
Dad?

17:01.184 --> 17:02.348
Yeah?

17:05.249 --> 17:06.449
Nothing.

17:08.525 --> 17:09.457
Hey, hey.

17:18.435 --> 17:22.769
Okay, I have a four-o'clock call,
so I will check in right after that.

17:23.340 --> 17:26.973
And Zola's right here.
Okay?

17:30.674 --> 17:31.774
Okay.

18:28.138 --> 18:29.070
Who're you?

18:29.739 --> 18:31.263
Mary Poppins.

18:33.743 --> 18:38.476
The tutor. Uh, your dad hired me.
I'm supposed to move in today.

18:40.750 --> 18:42.775
Tell my father
he can carpe diem in hell.

18:43.153 --> 18:44.085
Happy to.

18:44.154 --> 18:46.384
Meantime, how about
you cage the rage

18:46.456 --> 18:49.584
and invite me in for a nice,
hot bowl of Dad sucks?

18:49.960 --> 18:52.292
Saw right through that one,
Oprah?

18:52.362 --> 18:53.886
Yeah, it's a little gift
I have.

18:53.964 --> 18:56.797
Especially since
I can't actually see.

19:07.210 --> 19:09.041
- Hi, I am Will.
- Come in.

19:09.713 --> 19:12.648
I'll get Zola.
She'll welcome you to hell,

19:13.216 --> 19:15.000
fix you up
with your own bedroom,

19:15.255 --> 19:17.051
and explain
what happened to me and...

19:17.821 --> 19:20.051
and what I did
to deserve this.

19:20.724 --> 19:23.852
Oh, and please, please,
hang with us.

19:23.927 --> 19:26.555
Gouge the old man
for everything he's worth.

19:26.930 --> 19:28.158
He deserves it.

19:29.432 --> 19:30.763
You know what?
Obviously, he forgot

19:30.834 --> 19:33.564
to spin the borderline hostile act
of hiring a blind guy

19:33.637 --> 19:35.264
to tutor his creepshow son.

19:35.338 --> 19:38.364
As for learning calculus,
I think I'll take a pass.

19:43.747 --> 19:45.476
Nice to meet you.

19:52.756 --> 19:54.280
Sorry, I come back later.

20:05.669 --> 20:07.102
How old are your kids?

20:10.974 --> 20:13.909
Sixteen, thirteen, ten.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.622
You just left them?

20:31.294 --> 20:33.125
Can't get them green cards.

20:33.797 --> 20:35.924
But you left them.

20:39.402 --> 20:41.734
Parents do what
they do with what they know.

20:43.106 --> 20:45.631
They were not very big
when I leave.

20:45.709 --> 20:47.836
It was five years.

20:47.911 --> 20:50.641
For my little one,
it is half his life.

20:56.119 --> 20:58.849
There is a hole in my heart.

21:01.424 --> 21:04.393
So I know your father will come.

21:06.663 --> 21:07.687
I don't think so.

21:26.082 --> 21:27.811
Rob Kingson. Leave a message.

21:28.184 --> 21:29.811
It's me.

21:33.390 --> 21:35.620
Could you do me a favor?

21:35.692 --> 21:40.925
I, uh, I know we were
rescheduling for the next week,

21:41.998 --> 21:45.934
or maybe it was
the week after, but...

21:49.606 --> 21:51.039
Maybe we should...

21:52.609 --> 21:54.634
Maybe we should
just not pretend anymore.

23:25.268 --> 23:26.792
Sweet.

23:37.180 --> 23:38.112
Kendra!

23:40.383 --> 23:41.611
Kendra!

23:41.684 --> 23:43.709
Kendra! Kendra!

23:43.787 --> 23:45.618
I am begging you.

23:46.089 --> 23:48.114
Please make it end. Please.

23:48.191 --> 23:49.818
I can't do that.

23:49.893 --> 23:50.825
But... But I get it.

23:50.894 --> 23:53.226
I... I know what it's
like to be ugly.

23:53.596 --> 23:57.430
So you got me,
five months is enough,

23:57.500 --> 23:58.831
I learned the lesson.

23:59.502 --> 24:00.833
You learned nothing.

24:01.304 --> 24:04.364
Find someone who can see
better than you can.

24:06.743 --> 24:09.871
Seven more months
for someone to say, "I love you".

24:11.047 --> 24:12.981
Please!
Make this go away!

24:22.859 --> 24:23.791
Sloan?

24:28.565 --> 24:30.089
That sounded like Kyle,
didn't it?

24:30.166 --> 24:34.296
Weird.
I suck for not writing him back.

24:34.370 --> 24:35.894
I suck more.

24:35.972 --> 24:40.500
Well, but honestly, with him
gone, it's kind of a relief.

24:40.577 --> 24:42.704
Like, I always felt like
I had to be on

24:42.779 --> 24:48.115
and mean, like really mean...
to keep him entertained.

24:48.685 --> 24:51.313
And I know what you mean.
That's just the thing about him.

24:54.090 --> 24:55.318
Hey.

24:55.391 --> 24:56.415
Sorry.

24:57.193 --> 25:02.256
And I'm sorry
to spy on you, spying.

25:05.835 --> 25:07.359
Unbelievable.

25:07.837 --> 25:10.772
But it does sorta feel like
the death of romance unfolding

25:10.840 --> 25:13.172
before your very eyes,
doesn't it?

25:13.543 --> 25:14.874
Doesn't she have
a boyfriend?

25:14.944 --> 25:18.277
Yes, this is what
I'm saying.

25:19.449 --> 25:22.077
What happened to romance?

25:22.452 --> 25:26.081
Sappy, soppy longhand
love letters

25:29.459 --> 25:33.190
and you really, really don't have
to keep listening to me, by the way.

25:33.563 --> 25:36.589
Thing is that guy
they were talking about?

25:36.666 --> 25:38.497
They're way off.

25:38.868 --> 25:42.804
Personally I respect that
he called things as he saw them,

25:43.273 --> 25:45.707
even if he did see them wrong.

25:46.576 --> 25:48.100
Do you know what it really was?

25:48.177 --> 25:49.109
What?

25:50.880 --> 25:52.609
He was a shot of life.

26:38.661 --> 26:39.787
You're kidding, right?

26:48.871 --> 26:50.099
How do you do that?

26:50.873 --> 26:55.207
I went to this dance and
some emo chick gave me a dart hex.

26:55.278 --> 26:56.302
Bite me.

26:58.081 --> 27:01.107
Oh hey, now you're up,
want to learn something?

27:03.019 --> 27:05.453
- No!
- Be careful.

27:05.922 --> 27:08.948
Lose your smarts, blondes
will be telling jokes about you.

27:17.433 --> 27:20.061
My dad always said that
how much people like you

27:20.737 --> 27:23.865
is directly proportional to
what you look like.

27:28.645 --> 27:31.876
But they hated me.

27:35.251 --> 27:38.880
High school unquestionably
sucks ass.

27:40.957 --> 27:42.788
You went to regular school?

27:42.859 --> 27:45.589
At fifteen,
my friends lost their virginity.

27:45.962 --> 27:47.190
I lost my sight.

27:48.264 --> 27:50.391
But living hell has its upside.

27:51.267 --> 27:53.895
- Like better hearing?
- Yeah.

27:53.970 --> 27:56.404
And chicks dig blind guys.

28:00.476 --> 28:02.842
Too bad they don't dig
ugly guys.

28:04.614 --> 28:05.546
How do you know?

30:22.385 --> 30:24.319
Defying expectations,

30:24.387 --> 30:27.413
Blindie keeps up
his bitchin' sense of style.

30:28.991 --> 30:30.822
A holdover from my seeing days.

30:31.794 --> 30:35.924
Point being, no matter what,
how you look matters?

30:35.998 --> 30:40.230
Point being, it's not about
how others look at me,

30:40.903 --> 30:43.030
it's about
how I look at myself.

30:44.707 --> 30:46.732
Mental Rubiks cube, I know,

30:46.809 --> 30:49.039
but one day
it'll make sense.

33:34.877 --> 33:36.003
Ass-wipe.

33:36.078 --> 33:38.012
You have the humor
of a marmot.

33:39.782 --> 33:43.718
So, I heard someone
sneaking in late last night.

33:43.786 --> 33:44.718
Where'd you go?

33:44.787 --> 33:49.019
Isn't the benefit of having
no parents that you have no parents?

33:49.091 --> 33:50.217
Get off my back.

33:51.794 --> 33:54.820
But, uh, you know,
since we last talked,

33:54.897 --> 33:56.330
I've been thinking and...

33:57.099 --> 33:59.329
is there any kind
of eye operation?

33:59.402 --> 34:01.962
'Cause I saw, like,
every doctor in the country.

34:02.838 --> 34:06.171
Miracles only, but thanks.

34:06.542 --> 34:08.066
So where did you go
last night?

34:10.646 --> 34:11.977
I went to see
about this girl.

34:13.049 --> 34:14.983
I'm so happy for you!

34:15.551 --> 34:16.882
I didn't even talk to her.

34:16.952 --> 34:20.581
Baby steps. You think
you might say, "wassup"?

34:22.158 --> 34:24.183
The benefit of you being blind
is you can't see

34:24.260 --> 34:26.285
how I should so never say,
"wassup".

34:28.064 --> 34:31.591
Baby steps. We must celebrate.

34:31.967 --> 34:36.597
One, two, three. Wassup!

34:36.672 --> 34:37.798
Fore!

34:38.474 --> 34:42.501
One, two, three. Wassup!

34:43.179 --> 34:45.010
Wassup.

34:45.081 --> 34:46.708
Wassup!

35:20.850 --> 35:23.080
- Here's a sandwich, Ben.
- Thanks.

35:23.452 --> 35:25.579
How's your dad?
Stayin' out of trouble?

35:30.759 --> 35:33.990
Dad, I'm home. Dad?

35:35.264 --> 35:36.390
Come on.

35:40.970 --> 35:41.994
Dad!

35:50.980 --> 35:54.683
I don't have it.
Please, Victor, come on.

35:54.685 --> 35:56.014
Just hook me up.

35:58.787 --> 36:01.221
Just another week.
I just need a little more time.

36:01.290 --> 36:03.850
No, no, no, I'm not screwing around,
you sorry-ass addict.

36:03.926 --> 36:06.156
- Dad, not this again.
- I'm sorry, Lindy.

36:06.228 --> 36:08.355
Hey, shut up.
And you get out of here.

36:08.430 --> 36:10.557
Victor, please.
We'll get you your money.

36:10.933 --> 36:14.061
Give me and my brother
our money.

36:14.837 --> 36:15.769
Dad!

36:17.740 --> 36:18.672
No!

37:07.423 --> 37:08.447
Where is she?

37:11.827 --> 37:13.158
You killed him.

37:14.930 --> 37:17.262
Your daughter for my brother.

37:17.933 --> 37:19.958
Someday I'll find her.

37:20.636 --> 37:21.568
I wouldn't.

37:23.439 --> 37:24.667
What do you need?

37:26.642 --> 37:27.768
Come on,
what do you want?

37:31.847 --> 37:32.973
I want her.

37:35.050 --> 37:35.982
I'm want to protect her.

37:36.051 --> 37:37.382
I can protect her.

37:39.555 --> 37:42.388
Please. Did you hear him?

37:43.058 --> 37:45.185
If she stays with me,
she'll... she'll be safe.

37:47.062 --> 37:48.996
I don't know
who you are.

37:49.064 --> 37:52.192
But if she leaves...
If she leaves...

37:53.869 --> 37:55.302
cops will get these.

37:59.275 --> 38:01.937
No. It's just too twisted.

38:03.412 --> 38:04.936
So's killing a man.

38:10.019 --> 38:11.646
But what's she gonna think
of you?

38:24.833 --> 38:29.361
Zola, remember.
Hunter, not Kyle. Hunter.

38:31.540 --> 38:33.872
Hello, I'm Zola.

38:35.944 --> 38:37.878
- Where is he?
- You can go.

38:38.347 --> 38:39.678
I'm not gonna
just leave you here.

38:39.748 --> 38:40.680
With some stranger?

38:41.850 --> 38:44.182
Son of an old friend.
For your safety.

38:44.253 --> 38:46.380
Bullshit and I can take care
of myself.

38:46.455 --> 38:48.582
- I let you say goodbye.
- No need.

38:49.458 --> 38:50.982
How'm I gonna know
you're okay?

38:51.060 --> 38:52.391
You're not.

38:52.461 --> 38:53.985
Deal is,
I give up my life,

38:54.063 --> 38:56.793
my whole life, school, friends,
everything, everything.

38:56.865 --> 38:59.390
And in return,
you don't come see me,

38:59.468 --> 39:01.595
don't call me,
don't do anything.

39:02.204 --> 39:03.933
Just stay away.

39:05.107 --> 39:08.736
I screwed up,
keep screwing up, I know that,

39:09.411 --> 39:10.537
but I don't know
what else to do...

39:10.612 --> 39:11.738
You can leave.

39:28.230 --> 39:29.663
So I'm here, okay?

39:30.733 --> 39:35.067
Whoever you are. You come
near me, I taser your ass.

39:45.247 --> 39:47.181
So that makes two of us.

39:49.351 --> 39:52.280
43, 47...

39:52.325 --> 39:55.689
53, 59...

39:55.758 --> 39:59.194
- I got you food.
- Call someone who gives.

40:07.069 --> 40:09.003
I'd really like to explain.

40:11.473 --> 40:12.804
Please come out.

40:17.179 --> 40:18.305
Inviting.

40:22.284 --> 40:23.216
What?

41:30.786 --> 41:33.311
This time go to Barneys,
get Manolos or whatever

41:33.388 --> 41:35.913
sick-expensive kind Sloan
and her bimbots loved.

41:35.991 --> 41:39.017
Everything you say to me
about her, everything I see,

41:39.094 --> 41:40.527
tells me she's not the kind.

41:40.596 --> 41:41.528
Prada, then.

41:41.597 --> 41:42.529
To be bought.

41:43.398 --> 41:44.422
I'm not trying to buy her.

41:44.500 --> 41:46.229
You are. And she'll hate that.

41:48.704 --> 41:49.636
So what, then?

41:50.005 --> 41:51.939
What do you know about her?

41:52.307 --> 41:54.537
You must think about her.

41:55.110 --> 41:57.340
Me know you see who she is.

41:58.514 --> 42:02.075
Go on. Think.

42:10.759 --> 42:12.283
It's like you don't even know me.

42:12.661 --> 42:15.789
This whole thing is all kinds
of mess. It's just a bad scene.

42:15.864 --> 42:18.298
There's nothing remotely good
and I miss everybody.

42:18.367 --> 42:21.803
I miss being able to go out and
get deli coffee whenever I want.

42:21.870 --> 42:22.802
And the clinic.

42:22.871 --> 42:25.396
And everything that made me me.

42:25.474 --> 42:26.998
No, it's way screwed up and

42:27.075 --> 42:28.900
he thinks he can give me
a few presents

42:28.910 --> 42:30.603
and, like,
that fixes everything.

42:30.679 --> 42:34.115
I know it's just for a little while,
but I'm hating it.

42:34.483 --> 42:39.614
I hate missing school,
hate my dad, just hate hating.

42:39.688 --> 42:41.212
And I know it's life or death

42:41.290 --> 42:44.919
but I've been saving for that
Machu Picchu trip for three years.

42:44.993 --> 42:48.326
You know, the first thing
I did in my life just for me,

42:48.397 --> 42:50.331
just because I wanted to.

42:51.600 --> 42:54.433
Lindy... Lindy journeys to
a wonder of the world

42:54.503 --> 42:56.733
and finally seizes
her moment and...

43:00.208 --> 43:02.073
Jesus, what's your problem?

43:02.144 --> 43:03.270
What's with the mask?

43:03.345 --> 43:04.573
I didn't want to freak you out.

43:04.646 --> 43:07.581
Sure. The ski mask
didn't freak me out.

43:08.450 --> 43:11.476
I, uh, I...
I got you Jujyfruits.

43:16.058 --> 43:17.389
Can I ask you something?

43:18.460 --> 43:19.392
Why am I here?

43:19.461 --> 43:21.190
Because you need to be
protected.

43:21.263 --> 43:23.094
But I can take care
of myself.

43:23.165 --> 43:24.496
You don't even know me.

43:24.766 --> 43:26.597
But my Dad and...
and your Dad...

43:26.668 --> 43:29.000
I know, his mysterious
"friend from the past".

43:29.071 --> 43:31.198
He wanted someone
they couldn't trace you to.

43:31.273 --> 43:34.401
He's scared out of his mind
something will happen to you.

43:35.277 --> 43:37.006
Because of how much
he loves you.

43:37.779 --> 43:41.010
Which he kept saying
over and over.

43:42.985 --> 43:46.216
- Really?
- Yeah.

43:49.491 --> 43:51.118
Thanks for the Jujyfruits.

43:51.793 --> 43:52.817
You're welcome.

44:01.203 --> 44:04.969
The thinking thing killed.
Killed.

44:26.962 --> 44:30.796
Dear Lindy, I've been
thinking about letters recently.

44:30.866 --> 44:33.300
The real kind. Longhand.

44:33.368 --> 44:36.303
And how it's terrible that
nobody's writing them anymore.

44:36.672 --> 44:39.800
And so I decided to start
one to you, today.

44:41.977 --> 44:43.706
Now, you're doing what?

44:43.779 --> 44:46.009
Seeing if I can build
a greenhouse.

44:46.081 --> 44:47.912
She's very into roses.

44:48.283 --> 44:49.807
Each color means
something different, you know?

44:49.885 --> 44:53.116
Yeah. Well,
they all kind of mean,

44:53.188 --> 44:56.030
I'm the guy who cries
at chick flicks

44:56.033 --> 44:57.626
and sleeps
with stuffed animals.

45:02.230 --> 45:03.162
I'm not here.

45:12.340 --> 45:14.069
Hey. I'm Lindy.

45:14.142 --> 45:17.373
Hi. Will. A pleasure.

45:18.647 --> 45:19.875
I, uh... heard the game.

45:19.948 --> 45:21.882
- You a Rangers fan?
- Die-hard.

45:21.950 --> 45:24.384
I knew it. Guys' gal.

45:25.253 --> 45:26.481
Guys' gal.

45:28.957 --> 45:30.185
- Why don't you join me?
- Thanks.

45:30.258 --> 45:31.190
Sure.

45:32.961 --> 45:34.394
What's with all the tools?

45:34.463 --> 45:37.591
Uh, it's Hunter's thing.
It's a structure on the roof.

45:37.666 --> 45:38.997
Structure for what?

45:39.668 --> 45:43.104
You ever see the 1954
Devil Girl from Mars flick,

45:43.171 --> 45:46.800
Where they abduct virginal
teenage girls for breeding stock?

45:50.479 --> 45:53.312
I'm just...
It's a joke-joke. Sorry.

45:53.381 --> 45:56.509
I haven't gotten out much.
I'm losing my social graces.

45:56.585 --> 45:57.643
Rewind.

46:00.989 --> 46:02.854
Hi. Will. Pleasure.

46:03.425 --> 46:06.553
The building books
belong to Hunter,

46:06.628 --> 46:10.758
an all-around, way-good guy
who's contemplating building

46:11.933 --> 46:13.457
a greenhouse.

46:14.136 --> 46:17.071
- A greenhouse?
- Yeah.

46:18.039 --> 46:19.063
Rad.

46:22.043 --> 46:22.975
Right?

47:22.938 --> 47:24.064
Very funny.

47:32.647 --> 47:35.775
So are we gonna,
like, really meet?

47:37.252 --> 47:38.583
- Like, now?
- No.

47:39.154 --> 47:40.086
Okay.

47:46.261 --> 47:47.694
You lived here your whole life?

47:48.163 --> 47:50.688
No. Pretty recently.

47:51.566 --> 47:52.692
I was living with my dad,

47:52.767 --> 47:56.897
but he's the kinda guy
who can't really deal...

47:58.874 --> 48:00.705
I wouldn't know anything
about that.

48:02.410 --> 48:03.536
And your mom?

48:07.616 --> 48:10.449
Mine's dead. I never knew her.

48:11.219 --> 48:15.349
So... no mom...
Screwed-up dad.

48:15.824 --> 48:17.758
It's too bad we have
nothing in common.

48:23.031 --> 48:24.760
What's with the Korean TV?

48:26.434 --> 48:27.867
You speak Korean?

48:29.137 --> 48:31.571
- Fluently.
- Oh, really?

48:31.640 --> 48:32.868
What are they saying?

48:35.143 --> 48:36.167
"Bon Appetit."

48:37.245 --> 48:38.678
She didn't say "Bon Appetit".

48:38.747 --> 48:40.681
Oh, you speak Korean too?

48:40.749 --> 48:42.774
I don't like to show off,
but yes.

48:42.851 --> 48:45.183
And Koreans do not say
Bon Appetit.

48:45.854 --> 48:47.185
She said the Korean equivalent.

48:47.255 --> 48:48.187
Which is what?

48:48.256 --> 48:50.190
I hope you have
a big appetite

48:50.258 --> 48:54.388
such that you scarf food
and hurl chunks.

48:54.763 --> 48:56.196
No that's the subjunctive.

48:57.265 --> 48:58.789
I'll take Mom, you take Perm Boy.

48:58.867 --> 48:59.799
Game on.

49:02.203 --> 49:03.636
So what's she saying now?

49:04.806 --> 49:08.242
I love you, but when it comes
to hair, you are a clueless wonder

49:09.010 --> 49:12.446
I can tell you for a fact
that is not what she said.

49:12.514 --> 49:14.448
What Mom said was...

49:24.025 --> 49:26.050
Hope Will isn't
your Korean teacher.

49:28.229 --> 49:30.561
Do you, uh...
do you miss school?

49:31.633 --> 49:33.464
Like a natural-born wonk.

49:33.635 --> 49:37.469
Cause, uh... I have classes
if you want to come.

49:40.742 --> 49:43.074
Yes. I'd love to.

49:43.545 --> 49:45.979
- Tomorrow?
- Sure.

49:47.048 --> 49:50.779
Well, great.

49:50.852 --> 49:52.786
I guess good night then.

49:54.255 --> 49:55.187
Hold up.

50:16.378 --> 50:17.709
Pretty gruesome, huh?

50:23.385 --> 50:24.716
I've seen worse.

51:06.661 --> 51:07.787
We're having school today,

51:07.862 --> 51:09.887
but you need to make it
seem like we didn't just start

51:09.964 --> 51:11.795
and I need
to look smart.

51:13.068 --> 51:14.000
Lindy's coming.

51:16.171 --> 51:18.105
Shut up. What're we studying?

51:18.173 --> 51:21.006
Don't worry, I'll come up with
something graphic and humiliating.

51:21.076 --> 51:22.703
No, no, no.
I need to know what it is now.

51:22.777 --> 51:24.301
I need the answers in advance.

51:24.379 --> 51:25.812
That's called cheating.

51:25.880 --> 51:27.711
No, that's called trying
to get a girl to like you

51:27.782 --> 51:30.114
while look like the lead
in a slasher flick.

51:31.386 --> 51:33.217
- Shakespeare sonnet?
- Obvious.

51:33.288 --> 51:35.017
- E.E. Cummings.
- Cliche.

51:35.090 --> 51:38.321
What's cliche is the guy liking
school to impress the girl.

51:38.693 --> 51:41.423
What about the Frank O'Hara poem
"Having a Coke with You"?

51:42.297 --> 51:43.423
How do you know that poem?

51:43.498 --> 51:45.728
I Googled
"modern poetry, impress girls".

51:48.103 --> 51:49.536
But I need smart things to say.

51:50.305 --> 51:51.431
Good luck with that.

51:52.807 --> 51:56.038
I need another thinking thing.
Another thing Lindy'll like.

51:56.111 --> 51:57.339
It's for this morning.
Please don't ask.

51:57.412 --> 51:59.039
When my husband wanted me
to marry him,

51:59.114 --> 52:00.445
he would weave me baskets.

52:00.515 --> 52:02.881
Yeah, I really don't think
that's gonna work.

52:03.251 --> 52:05.378
- What about chocolate?
- Oh, no.

52:05.453 --> 52:06.385
Come on.

52:06.754 --> 52:08.881
She will like it
when you are being kind.

52:10.058 --> 52:11.491
Yeah, I suck at that

52:11.559 --> 52:13.186
When you are being yourself.

52:13.261 --> 52:15.286
What, this self or the jerk
I was?

52:16.664 --> 52:19.292
The man I know you to be.

53:03.945 --> 53:05.276
How'd you do it?

53:05.547 --> 53:08.675
I, uh,
I just figured it out.

53:12.954 --> 53:14.683
I love "Having a Coke
with You".

53:15.056 --> 53:16.489
- Shoot me now.
- What?

53:17.559 --> 53:22.087
No, I mean, that's great,
that you know all about it

53:22.163 --> 53:24.688
and will have
lots of smart things to say.

53:25.767 --> 53:27.394
Blind man climbing.

53:28.369 --> 53:30.803
- Could you just hang on a sec?
- Ow! Blind guy tripping.

53:33.675 --> 53:35.006
- You're okay?
- Peachy.

53:35.076 --> 53:36.202
Zola, thanks for getting these.

53:36.277 --> 53:37.904
And by the way,
I'm up the creek.

53:37.979 --> 53:40.504
It turns out "Having a Coke with
You" is one of Lindy's favorites.

53:40.582 --> 53:42.516
God, I'm looking forward
to this class.

53:44.385 --> 53:46.410
- Here you go.
- How'd you know?

53:46.487 --> 53:48.512
Deli coffee, very underrated.

53:49.090 --> 53:50.318
As I've always said.

53:53.895 --> 53:55.021
Long-time green thumb?

53:55.697 --> 53:57.130
No, no.

53:59.500 --> 54:02.162
Actually my dad stuck me
in this house

54:02.237 --> 54:03.568
so no one could see me.

54:03.638 --> 54:06.573
And I thought I'd take the,
the ugly and

54:06.641 --> 54:08.973
shameful thing and
turn it into something not.

54:14.148 --> 54:19.176
Of course, not everyone
can necessarily see its beauty...

54:19.254 --> 54:21.188
Just read.

54:29.364 --> 54:30.695
Having a Coke with You

54:31.165 --> 54:34.100
is even more fun than
going to San Sebastian,

54:35.370 --> 54:38.600
Irun, Hendaye,

54:39.345 --> 54:42.300
Biarritz, Bayonne

54:42.377 --> 54:43.708
or being sick
to my stomach

54:43.778 --> 54:47.214
on the Travesera de Gracia
in Barcelona

54:47.882 --> 54:50.316
partly because
in your orange shirt

54:50.385 --> 54:53.718
you look like a better
happier St. Sebastian

54:54.188 --> 54:56.213
partly because
of my love for you.

55:03.531 --> 55:04.862
We be back.

55:04.932 --> 55:07.867
We... Oh, yeah, we be back.
We be back.

55:07.935 --> 55:08.867
Carry on.

55:18.946 --> 55:21.881
In the warm New York
4 o'clock light,

55:21.949 --> 55:25.578
we are drifting back and forth
between each other

55:25.653 --> 55:29.282
like a tree breathing
through its spectacles.

55:38.666 --> 55:42.693
And the portrait show
seems to have no faces in it at all,

55:43.071 --> 55:44.698
just paint.

55:44.972 --> 55:48.100
You suddenly wonder why
in the world anyone ever did them.

55:48.976 --> 55:52.810
I look at you and I would rather
look at you than

55:52.880 --> 55:54.814
all the portraits in the world.

56:22.243 --> 56:23.267
I need more time.

56:24.145 --> 56:26.170
Magic can't be undone.

56:26.247 --> 56:27.475
But I might have a shot
if I had more time.

56:27.548 --> 56:29.175
Can't, sorry.

56:29.550 --> 56:32.781
Okay. I pissed you off.
You wasted me.

56:32.854 --> 56:34.879
But there's got to be something
you can do.

56:34.956 --> 56:36.184
Come on, help me.

56:36.257 --> 56:37.986
I can't.
And I wouldn't.

56:38.059 --> 56:40.186
You still don't think about
anyone but yourself.

56:43.164 --> 56:45.598
You're wrong.
I do think about other people.

56:45.666 --> 56:47.395
I think about Lindy
and what her life is like

56:47.468 --> 56:48.901
and I think about
a woman who can't see her kids

56:48.970 --> 56:50.403
and a man who can't see,
period.

56:53.374 --> 56:54.500
So he cares now?

56:56.878 --> 56:59.711
Yeah. Yeah.

57:00.681 --> 57:02.842
Okay, I'll keep trying
with Lindy.

57:02.917 --> 57:07.047
But please give Will his sight,
Zola her family.

57:08.022 --> 57:09.046
It's the least they deserve

57:09.123 --> 57:10.852
after being trapped
in this hell with me.

57:10.925 --> 57:14.656
I'll help them.
If you succeed.

57:19.434 --> 57:22.961
And Kyle, good luck.

57:33.147 --> 57:35.377
- I got your CDs.
- Thanks.

57:50.865 --> 57:53.390
Just some guy
at my old school.

57:53.768 --> 57:55.793
- Kind of a jerk, actually.
- Really?

57:55.870 --> 57:57.804
Yeah, we were
on this committee together,

57:57.872 --> 57:59.897
so that's why
I have his picture.

58:00.274 --> 58:03.539
I mean...
Looks-wise, he doesn't suck.

58:03.611 --> 58:05.238
Oh! He knew it, too.

58:06.214 --> 58:07.442
Same old, same old:

58:07.515 --> 58:09.142
jerks are exciting
and my type falls for 'em.

58:09.217 --> 58:12.050
- Did you fall for him?
- Not that I fell for him.

58:14.722 --> 58:17.156
Every once in a while,
you kind of remind me of him.

58:17.925 --> 58:19.950
Not that you're a jerk.

58:22.129 --> 58:26.566
Anyways, he disappeared. Rehab.

58:27.535 --> 58:31.869
Oh, it figures. The addict's
daughter falls for the addict.

58:31.939 --> 58:33.566
So you did fall for him?

58:34.642 --> 58:37.668
No, I mean, I just talked to him
his last night.

58:37.745 --> 58:38.871
For, like, a minute.

58:39.847 --> 58:41.576
You know, the truly
ridiculous thing is,

58:41.649 --> 58:43.276
I might have, kind of, sort of,

58:43.351 --> 58:47.685
actually thought he,
a little bit, liked me... ish.

58:48.256 --> 58:49.188
Of course he did.

58:49.257 --> 58:50.189
Oh, please.

58:50.258 --> 58:54.490
He was completely on the in
and I was not, am not.

58:54.562 --> 58:55.790
That's why I like you.

58:59.066 --> 59:01.830
Yeah, well... same.

59:02.403 --> 59:05.236
Anyways, being on the in
isn't all that.

59:05.306 --> 59:08.241
Isn't that what people on the out
say to make each other feel better?

59:08.609 --> 59:12.545
Yeah. But it also happens
to be true.

59:15.316 --> 59:16.840
Something about him...

59:17.718 --> 59:18.650
What?

59:19.520 --> 59:23.047
Underneath all the bullshit was...
I don't know.

59:24.025 --> 59:25.049
What?

59:26.427 --> 59:27.359
Good.

59:28.029 --> 59:29.053
Good?

59:31.532 --> 59:34.660
So, I mean, are you still
into him?

59:35.336 --> 59:38.464
Like you said, you don't want to be
the girl who falls for jerks.

59:38.539 --> 59:40.268
Yeah.
But he... he's not.

59:40.341 --> 59:42.571
Right.
He's a decent guy at heart.

59:42.643 --> 59:43.974
That's what I'm thinking.

59:44.045 --> 59:46.775
But still kinda... wrong.

59:47.548 --> 59:48.480
Yeah.

59:50.251 --> 59:51.275
I don't know.

59:51.953 --> 59:56.686
You know, that something underneath,
it's catnip for sappy tools like me.

59:58.359 --> 1:00:00.088
To be the one who uncovers it.

1:00:09.370 --> 1:00:10.997
Do you want to go
somewhere with me?

1:00:23.484 --> 1:00:25.611
Usually, if I'm out
this time of night,

1:00:25.686 --> 1:00:27.210
I'm looking for my dad,

1:00:27.888 --> 1:00:29.913
mace in hand,
counting by primes.

1:00:29.991 --> 1:00:30.923
Counting?

1:00:30.992 --> 1:00:32.823
It keeps me
from getting scared.

1:00:34.295 --> 1:00:39.232
Oh. Fortunately,
scary guy's right next to you.

1:00:40.001 --> 1:00:41.332
So there's that.

1:00:43.804 --> 1:00:45.431
What about
when people see you?

1:00:45.806 --> 1:00:48.138
They don't.
I got it down.

1:00:48.909 --> 1:00:50.843
I was good at blending in too.

1:00:54.415 --> 1:00:55.245
This way.

1:00:57.318 --> 1:00:59.047
You taking me to the park?

1:00:59.620 --> 1:01:01.884
You'll see. Come on.

1:01:04.859 --> 1:01:05.883
The zoo?

1:01:09.764 --> 1:01:10.696
Hear that?

1:01:11.966 --> 1:01:16.300
The animals. Water lapping.

1:01:18.572 --> 1:01:21.200
In some nearby street,
a man is whispering...

1:01:22.476 --> 1:01:23.500
"I love you."

1:01:28.482 --> 1:01:29.414
Do you hear that?

1:01:32.787 --> 1:01:33.617
What?

1:01:33.688 --> 1:01:36.418
Somewhere there's a baboon
scratching his ass.

1:02:00.414 --> 1:02:01.346
Why are we here?

1:02:01.949 --> 1:02:03.780
This place is important to me.

1:02:23.270 --> 1:02:24.396
It's still here.

1:02:25.873 --> 1:02:26.999
What is it?

1:02:28.375 --> 1:02:30.002
When I was in kindergarten,

1:02:30.878 --> 1:02:33.312
my dad offered to take me
anywhere I wanted.

1:02:34.582 --> 1:02:35.913
We came to the zoo.

1:02:37.685 --> 1:02:40.313
He bought me
all the toys and candy I wanted.

1:02:41.388 --> 1:02:44.414
And at the end of the day,
he told me my mother had left.

1:02:47.795 --> 1:02:49.228
I haven't seen her since.

1:02:55.102 --> 1:02:57.434
After he told me,
I ran away and hid in here.

1:02:57.905 --> 1:02:59.236
And saw this movie.

1:03:04.645 --> 1:03:08.479
It's about this mother elephant
whose two babies die.

1:03:09.049 --> 1:03:10.880
Plague or something.

1:03:15.456 --> 1:03:16.980
She misses them so much

1:03:17.057 --> 1:03:19.787
that when she's migrating back
a year later...

1:03:21.061 --> 1:03:23.720
A year later...

1:03:25.600 --> 1:03:27.790
She finds her babies'
bones.

1:03:32.573 --> 1:03:34.302
Can you imagine that love?

1:03:37.178 --> 1:03:38.110
No.

1:03:47.188 --> 1:03:49.622
I never brought anyone
here before.

1:04:08.542 --> 1:04:14.174
Seven, eight, nine...

1:04:15.449 --> 1:04:21.183
Ten, eleven, twelve...

1:04:23.958 --> 1:04:25.983
It feels like I've known you
forever.

1:04:29.663 --> 1:04:31.250
Thirteen,

1:04:32.190 --> 1:04:34.170
fourteen,

1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:36.302
fifteen...

1:04:36.370 --> 1:04:37.701
The sun's coming up.

1:04:49.783 --> 1:04:51.011
I think...

1:04:54.288 --> 1:04:55.516
I think I love you.

1:05:58.385 --> 1:05:59.909
Maybe I should let her go.

1:06:00.487 --> 1:06:02.250
At least she'll be safe
in Machu Picchu.

1:06:02.323 --> 1:06:04.848
She has been jonesing
for that trip forever,

1:06:04.925 --> 1:06:06.358
even without being stuck here.

1:06:06.427 --> 1:06:09.453
But every day,
she like you more and more.

1:06:09.530 --> 1:06:10.861
But not the way I like her.

1:06:11.532 --> 1:06:13.557
- Move your hands. My turn.
- Sorry.

1:06:14.435 --> 1:06:15.868
I don't stand a chance.

1:06:15.936 --> 1:06:19.064
She's still talking about
running away. And...

1:06:21.241 --> 1:06:24.267
I know you guys
want out, too.

1:06:24.645 --> 1:06:26.169
- Desperately.
- No.

1:06:26.547 --> 1:06:28.276
Kidding. Kidding.

1:06:28.349 --> 1:06:30.283
Look, even if she does go
on the trip,

1:06:30.351 --> 1:06:33.479
you still have a couple days
to ratchet up the romance quotient.

1:06:33.554 --> 1:06:36.489
Just try to put yourself
in her shoes.

1:06:36.557 --> 1:06:38.684
This is all so strange
for her,

1:06:38.759 --> 1:06:41.990
but me know she'll say
those words, "I love you".

1:06:43.464 --> 1:06:44.988
It's just the year is almost up.

1:06:46.767 --> 1:06:49.895
Just take her to whatever
bad-boy country house Daddy's got.

1:06:49.970 --> 1:06:51.198
Daddy don't got.

1:06:54.375 --> 1:06:55.501
Just the lake cottage.

1:06:56.877 --> 1:06:59.505
Just the...

1:06:59.580 --> 1:07:02.845
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Would you buy a frickin' vowel? Go!

1:08:20.727 --> 1:08:22.160
Seriously?

1:08:25.532 --> 1:08:26.464
After you.

1:08:37.544 --> 1:08:40.980
So, are you, uh,
dying of boredom yet?

1:08:42.749 --> 1:08:43.681
No.

1:08:46.253 --> 1:08:49.780
It must have been so great
as a kid coming out here.

1:08:50.657 --> 1:08:53.285
My dad got bad reception down
at the lake.

1:08:54.461 --> 1:08:56.895
He could only take it
for about forty-five minutes.

1:08:58.065 --> 1:09:02.024
But those forty-five minutes...
they were awesome.

1:09:07.107 --> 1:09:11.635
My Dad was a teacher.
You know, before my mom died and

1:09:12.813 --> 1:09:14.246
he lost it.

1:09:14.715 --> 1:09:15.739
Do you miss your dad?

1:09:16.817 --> 1:09:17.841
Not right now.

1:09:19.520 --> 1:09:23.547
In the past few months,
living away from my dad...

1:09:24.625 --> 1:09:28.061
not spending every second
worrying about him,

1:09:28.629 --> 1:09:31.154
I mean, not trying to
fix everything for him,

1:09:31.231 --> 1:09:34.564
Just not totally losing myself.

1:09:35.035 --> 1:09:38.266
That's why I wanted to go away
on that trip in the first place.

1:09:41.041 --> 1:09:42.975
I guess this cage set me free.

1:09:45.546 --> 1:09:46.774
Is that a "thank you"?

1:09:49.049 --> 1:09:51.677
- Let's go down to the lake.
- Okay.

1:10:12.673 --> 1:10:14.903
I've been writing something
for you.

1:10:15.576 --> 1:10:17.908
- What is it?
- A letter.

1:10:37.998 --> 1:10:40.626
I'm sorry.
This ring is only...

1:10:41.501 --> 1:10:42.433
Hello?

1:10:44.404 --> 1:10:46.235
Which hospital?

1:10:46.306 --> 1:10:48.433
Okay. I'll... I'll...
I'll call you back.

1:10:53.914 --> 1:10:55.438
My father OD'd.

1:10:59.319 --> 1:11:00.547
You have to go to him.

1:11:13.467 --> 1:11:14.991
All aboard!

1:11:27.981 --> 1:11:29.107
- Thank you.
- Go, go, go!

1:11:29.182 --> 1:11:30.410
- I'll call you.
- He's gonna be fine.

1:11:30.484 --> 1:11:32.918
Okay. I'll call you. And as soon as
he's better, I'll come back.

1:11:33.587 --> 1:11:35.418
And everything will be
all right.

1:11:36.690 --> 1:11:37.714
And Hunter...

1:11:38.692 --> 1:11:39.624
Yeah?

1:11:43.797 --> 1:11:45.424
You're a good friend.

1:12:06.353 --> 1:12:07.877
Don't.
Don't read that.

1:12:08.555 --> 1:12:12.082
Don't read that.
Don't read that.

1:12:17.064 --> 1:12:21.398
Dear Lindy, I've been
thinking about letters recently.

1:12:21.768 --> 1:12:24.202
The real kind. Longhand.

1:12:24.271 --> 1:12:27.297
And how it's terrible that
nobody's writing them anymore.

1:12:27.574 --> 1:12:30.907
And so I decided to start
one to you, today.

1:12:30.977 --> 1:12:32.640
And I'm going to write
to you

1:12:32.660 --> 1:12:36.610
every day for a long,
long, long time

1:12:37.784 --> 1:12:43.313
because I think...
I think I might be in danger of...

1:12:43.890 --> 1:12:45.221
falling in love with you.

1:12:55.001 --> 1:12:59.335
Hey, it's me.
Uh, my dad is gonna be okay, but

1:12:59.706 --> 1:13:02.971
I really want to talk to you
about your letter.

1:13:03.443 --> 1:13:04.876
Where are you?

1:13:06.146 --> 1:13:07.773
Look, I don't understand.

1:13:07.848 --> 1:13:09.281
You wrote me this letter.

1:13:09.349 --> 1:13:10.873
Why don't you call me back?

1:13:11.451 --> 1:13:12.884
Because I'm "a good friend".

1:13:13.353 --> 1:13:14.980
What's going on?

1:13:17.357 --> 1:13:18.324
Hunter...

1:13:36.176 --> 1:13:37.507
I'm out of time.

1:13:37.577 --> 1:13:38.407
Call her back.

1:13:38.478 --> 1:13:40.002
Why, because I'm
"a good friend"?

1:13:40.080 --> 1:13:41.012
Yup.

1:13:41.081 --> 1:13:43.606
And not calling her back,
what good that do, huh?

1:13:44.284 --> 1:13:47.617
She even called me.
Why won't you talk to her?

1:13:47.687 --> 1:13:51.623
The last time I talked to her,
she told me she's hurt.

1:13:51.691 --> 1:13:55.627
And "hurt" is girl-speak for,
"Call now, bonehead".

1:13:57.097 --> 1:13:58.325
She don't know what to do,

1:13:58.398 --> 1:14:00.832
so she go back to school
to go on the trip.

1:14:42.375 --> 1:14:43.307
Lindy!

1:14:51.585 --> 1:14:52.609
What're you doing here?

1:14:52.986 --> 1:14:54.613
I had to see you
before you left.

1:14:54.688 --> 1:14:56.121
- You wrote me that letter.
- I know.

1:14:56.189 --> 1:14:58.623
- And then you didn't
call me back. - I'm sorry.

1:14:58.692 --> 1:15:00.421
You knew what was going on
with me.

1:15:00.494 --> 1:15:01.825
I was being dumb.

1:15:01.895 --> 1:15:03.954
- I just was scared you didn't...
- Didn't what?

1:15:04.030 --> 1:15:05.156
Love me.

1:15:09.035 --> 1:15:12.664
And I didn't think you could.
Because of how ugly I am.

1:15:17.644 --> 1:15:21.080
And I should have known better,
that that's not who you are.

1:15:24.951 --> 1:15:29.388
You took one look at me
and still said you'd seen worse.

1:15:32.259 --> 1:15:36.491
Somehow...
when I'm around you...

1:15:40.667 --> 1:15:42.396
I don't feel ugly at all.

1:15:45.171 --> 1:15:46.900
It's because you're not.

1:16:32.152 --> 1:16:33.084
Go.

1:16:33.653 --> 1:16:34.779
You deserve it.

1:16:45.865 --> 1:16:47.992
Nothing's gonna change
while you're gone.

1:16:49.869 --> 1:16:51.496
That I can promise.

1:17:05.218 --> 1:17:06.150
Go.

1:17:12.726 --> 1:17:13.658
Go.

1:17:23.637 --> 1:17:24.569
Hunter.

1:17:29.142 --> 1:17:30.268
I love you.

1:18:05.412 --> 1:18:06.538
Kyle.

1:18:42.849 --> 1:18:43.781
Hunter!

1:18:45.351 --> 1:18:46.283
Kyle!

1:18:47.153 --> 1:18:49.678
Sorry, I'm looking for someone,
I don't mean to be rude.

1:18:49.756 --> 1:18:50.882
- I get it.
- Thanks.

1:18:50.957 --> 1:18:52.390
And sometime, you'll tell me
what happened to you.

1:18:52.459 --> 1:18:54.188
- I... I met someone.
- That's great.

1:18:54.260 --> 1:18:55.887
She reminds me of you.

1:18:56.563 --> 1:18:58.190
And she showed me
that love can change you.

1:18:58.264 --> 1:18:59.390
Do you think love change you?

1:18:59.466 --> 1:19:00.398
Of course.

1:19:00.767 --> 1:19:02.029
Then you'll believe the story
I'm about to tell you.

1:19:02.102 --> 1:19:03.034
Where is he?

1:19:03.103 --> 1:19:07.130
It's about a guy, good-looking
on the outside, ugly on the inside.

1:19:07.207 --> 1:19:10.040
And there's a curse.
Love... Love changes him.

1:19:10.110 --> 1:19:11.543
Everyone knows that story.

1:19:13.012 --> 1:19:16.140
What if it wasn't a story?
What if it were true?

1:19:16.216 --> 1:19:17.148
What?

1:19:53.253 --> 1:19:56.689
Can you imagine...
that love?

1:20:03.163 --> 1:20:04.095
Can you?

1:20:11.070 --> 1:20:12.002
Yeah.

1:20:27.487 --> 1:20:28.511
It's you.

1:20:58.318 --> 1:21:01.151
Wake up. Wake up.

1:21:02.956 --> 1:21:07.484
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

1:21:12.165 --> 1:21:14.190
It's a dream, right?

1:21:15.568 --> 1:21:16.899
It's must be.

1:21:19.472 --> 1:21:20.700
But happy.

1:21:22.075 --> 1:21:24.009
Very damn happy.

1:21:27.580 --> 1:21:30.811
Mr. Kingson, your new intern
is coming up in the elevator,

1:21:30.884 --> 1:21:32.408
I thought you might want
to meet her.

1:21:32.485 --> 1:21:34.009
Just so long as she's
easy on the eyes.

1:21:34.087 --> 1:21:36.317
Well she's a bit odd looking.

1:21:36.389 --> 1:21:38.016
No dogfaces, no dumpy frumps.

1:21:38.091 --> 1:21:40.616
But her reference said
no matter what you throw her way,

1:21:40.693 --> 1:21:42.820
she can always work magic.
