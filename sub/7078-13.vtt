WEBVTT

00:02.711 --> 00:05.380
This is Russell Borchert,
computer genius...

00:05.672 --> 00:07.633
anti-deodorant activist,
and millionaire.

00:07.925 --> 00:11.053
He was rich for having invented
the nine-track cassette...

00:11.345 --> 00:14.473
which the eight-track industry
paid to keep quiet.

00:14.765 --> 00:17.851
He funnelled that wealth into
a computer school called Greendale...

00:18.143 --> 00:20.312
where he obsessively pursued
a new project...

00:20.604 --> 00:23.315
a machine that can process feelings.

00:24.399 --> 00:27.653
He apparently used nothing but gold
to assemble his circuitry...

00:27.945 --> 00:30.614
believing it to be a better conductor
of human emotion.

00:30.906 --> 00:33.325
It was a weird time.
The Bionic Woman won an Emmy.

00:33.617 --> 00:36.662
Rumours spread about his relationship
with computers...

00:36.954 --> 00:38.830
and one day, he disappeared.

00:39.122 --> 00:41.792
Hence the legend that he died
of the first computer virus.

00:42.084 --> 00:44.127
The city bought the campus,
and life went on.

00:44.419 --> 00:47.673
His body was never found,
nor was his immense wealth.

00:47.965 --> 00:51.927
Some people said he hid his money
using a portal to another dimension.

00:52.219 --> 00:53.637
Those people were on LSD.

00:53.929 --> 00:57.015
Everyone else said
he had a secret vault in his office.

00:57.599 --> 00:59.351
Well, where is his office?

00:59.643 --> 01:00.643
Good question.

01:00.894 --> 01:04.480
We found this confession
written by Greendale's first dean.

01:04.772 --> 01:07.693
"To protect the student health
and the school's reputation..."

01:07.985 --> 01:10.612
I have sealed off
the Computer Department...

01:10.904 --> 01:12.990
"and removed the stairwell
to that section."

01:13.282 --> 01:16.076
Section that remains on this campus,
its secrets untouched...

01:16.368 --> 01:18.048
including possibly Borchert's millions.

01:18.203 --> 01:21.582
If we found it we could buy it
from the city before Subway.

01:21.873 --> 01:23.875
Then I could really go nuts
with this place.

01:24.167 --> 01:26.086
This adventure I usually have
to force upon us.

01:26.378 --> 01:28.755
It is falling into our laps.
We're like the Goonies.

01:29.047 --> 01:32.676
- Except our story tracks logically.
- And we're not talking over each other.

01:32.968 --> 01:35.470
- Everyone talks at the same time. Sorry.
- Can you stop?

01:35.762 --> 01:37.723
Here are your blueprints.
Sorry it took long.

01:38.015 --> 01:42.144
- You can't fight city hall.
- You can. That's why it took so long.

01:43.228 --> 01:46.023
- I'll be damned. Will you look at that?
- It's so clear now.

01:46.315 --> 01:48.400
The entire school
is shaped like a penis.

01:48.692 --> 01:52.362
No, that. It says right here that
this stairway leads to sublevel three.

01:52.654 --> 01:54.406
Is that where the teachers' lounge is?

01:55.115 --> 01:56.908
What the hell does your penis
look like?

01:57.200 --> 02:00.245
Obviously a cluster of buildings.
Let's have a laugh at the freak.

02:02.331 --> 02:04.166
♪ Give me some more
Time in a dream ♪

02:04.458 --> 02:07.544
♪ Give me the hope
To run out of steam ♪

02:07.836 --> 02:10.672
♪ Somebody said It can be here ♪

02:10.964 --> 02:14.885

02:19.973 --> 02:23.935
♪ One by one they all
Just fade away ♪

02:28.065 --> 02:30.484
Missing stairwell would be in this area.
Eyes peeled.

02:30.776 --> 02:34.112
Serial killers and people that
hide treasure leave weird little clues.

02:34.404 --> 02:37.282
Check it out. Look at the bottle
held by the school's first...

02:37.574 --> 02:40.077
and least acceptable mascot,
Big Chief Drunky.

02:40.369 --> 02:42.287
X marks the spot, baby.

02:42.579 --> 02:45.082
Hey, Hickey, maybe you shouldn't be...

02:45.374 --> 02:46.917
Okay.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.796
- Shirley, will you lock the door?
- Okay.

02:52.000 --> 02:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:01.348 --> 03:02.724
There you go.

03:04.226 --> 03:05.811
It's just a bunch of wires.

03:06.103 --> 03:08.063
Exactly what they want us to think.

03:10.982 --> 03:12.150
Oh, my God.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.319
Wait, wait, wait!

03:14.611 --> 03:16.655
The sparks may be spelling out
the next clue.

03:19.241 --> 03:20.784
Jeff, do something.

03:26.957 --> 03:27.957
Is Duncan okay?

03:28.208 --> 03:32.170
He'll live, but his food's gonna taste
like burnt aluminium for a while.

03:32.462 --> 03:33.797
It's pronounced "aluminium."

03:34.089 --> 03:35.132
See, he's fine.

03:35.424 --> 03:37.175
Okay, guys, stop it. Now.

03:37.467 --> 03:41.012
Nobody wants to admit it's over,
but come on.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.390
Oh, look, it's Jeff Winger, fun police...

03:43.724 --> 03:45.308
here to pull over our smiles...

03:45.600 --> 03:47.477
because our mouths
have tinted windows.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.604
- Britta and I are getting married.
- What?

03:49.896 --> 03:52.691
Married? Well, you're gonna need
way more doves than this.

03:52.983 --> 03:55.861
What does this look like,
an hour-long episode of The Office?

03:56.153 --> 03:58.822
There's pick-axing
and electric zapping.

03:59.114 --> 04:02.159
Don't even acknowledge it.
We are not acknowledging this.

04:02.451 --> 04:04.411
You guys are ridiculous together.

04:04.703 --> 04:06.455
We're ridiculous?
What do you call this?

04:06.747 --> 04:07.747
Secret trapdoor!

04:07.956 --> 04:09.291
Booyah!

04:15.630 --> 04:19.551
- Who's got rope?
- I'm offended by that question.

04:22.929 --> 04:26.057
Richie and Carl from the school board.
That's right. We got names.

04:26.349 --> 04:27.559
Open this door now.

04:27.851 --> 04:30.103
- Wait, I know where the keys are.
- You hear that?

04:30.395 --> 04:33.690
When we get in there,
you're gonna be in big trouble.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.193
Here they are. Here they are.

04:36.485 --> 04:39.070
- Which one is it?
- Well, it's never the first one...

04:39.362 --> 04:41.907
- so we can cancel this one out.
- Come on.

04:42.199 --> 04:45.285
I guess now this is the first one,
so it should be the next one.

04:45.577 --> 04:48.163
- Oh, damn.
- You know what? I got it.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.499
- Get out of the way.
- Richie, be careful.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.335
Don't worry. I've been drinking.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.423
Oh, hello. Would you like some tea?

04:59.007 --> 05:00.258
The tea is swell.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.726
Do you think they can hea...?

05:10.560 --> 05:11.770
I think that...

05:12.062 --> 05:13.647
Oh, come on.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.275
You know it's just as loud as...

05:20.987 --> 05:23.114
Everybody, shut up!

05:25.867 --> 05:28.703
Guys, I think this is the lost section
of Greendale.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.081
Nobody's been in here since the '70s.

05:31.373 --> 05:33.333
- How do you know?
- The debate team topic is:

05:33.625 --> 05:35.794
"Who's hotter,
Elliott Gould or Donald Sutherland?"

05:36.086 --> 05:38.129
- Donald Sutherland.
- Donald Sutherland.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.761
- Scary.
- Oh, relax.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.639
If it's like a regular dungeon,
it's only as dangerous...

05:47.931 --> 05:49.057
as whoever invited you.

05:49.349 --> 05:52.811
Abed, if there's killer robots down here,
you'll tell them we're on your side.

05:53.103 --> 05:55.647
Won't know them from ordinary robots
until they kill us.

05:55.939 --> 05:57.774
Well, what do we do now?

05:58.066 --> 06:00.151
Split up.
Leave no '70s reference unturned.

06:00.443 --> 06:04.948
This decade's out of my wheelhouse.
Pet Rock, leave no Pet Rock unturned.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.616
Let me lead. My light's better.

06:06.908 --> 06:09.369
You're that insecure
that your light has to be better?

06:09.661 --> 06:11.413
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

06:11.705 --> 06:12.789
Anything in there?

06:13.081 --> 06:16.459
It's just spider webs
and beanbag chairs.

06:16.751 --> 06:19.129
Don't cry. The importance
of lumbar support hadn't...

06:19.421 --> 06:20.672
It's not that. It's just...

06:20.964 --> 06:24.509
Even if we do save Greendale,
which Greendale will we be saving?

06:24.801 --> 06:27.178
I mean, first Pierce dies,
then Troy leaves.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.514
- Now people are...
- Getting married?

06:30.432 --> 06:32.434
Annie, look, I don't know people.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.896
But I know TV. When characters
feel the show they're on is ending...

06:36.187 --> 06:38.307
their instinct is to spin off
into something safer.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.649
In Jeff and Britta's case...

06:39.941 --> 06:42.485
something that'd
last six episodes, have bickering...

06:42.777 --> 06:44.946
starring them
and an equally WASP-y couple...

06:45.238 --> 06:48.283
with a title like "Better With
My Worse Half" or "Tying the Not."

06:48.575 --> 06:51.119
"Knot" is spelled without a K.
Or #CouplePeopleProblems.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.039
- Every episode, you decide who has...
- Stop developing.

06:54.331 --> 06:55.415
Sorry.

06:56.207 --> 07:01.671
The point is, this show, Annie,
it isn't just their show.

07:01.963 --> 07:06.217
This is our show, and it's not over.
And the sooner we find that treasure...

07:06.509 --> 07:08.678
the faster the Jeff-Britta pilot
falls apart.

07:08.970 --> 07:10.096
Got it.

07:10.513 --> 07:11.556
Thank you, Abed.

07:11.848 --> 07:13.558
You're welcome.

07:15.310 --> 07:17.020
- I have a girlfriend.
- What?

07:17.312 --> 07:20.065
- You were about to start a kiss lean.
- I was not.

07:20.357 --> 07:21.566
Fine. Let's find treasure.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.404
- Did you find anything?
- No.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.740
We've searched every crevice
of this place...

07:29.032 --> 07:31.701
and the only treasures we've found
are this CB radio...

07:31.993 --> 07:34.454
these basketball cards
with white people on them...

07:34.746 --> 07:37.624
and this little rocket launcher
from some action figure.

07:39.334 --> 07:42.087
It seems like an odd place
for a dead end though.

07:42.379 --> 07:43.505
It could be a secret door.

07:43.797 --> 07:45.757
Maybe the jukebox is the key to it.

07:46.049 --> 07:48.635
Just remember, it's okay if we fail.

07:48.927 --> 07:50.220
- Right, Jeff?
- That's right.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.600
Try every button.
Just try every single button ever.

07:58.812 --> 08:02.273
- Are you all right?
- No! I was dying!

08:03.608 --> 08:04.776
Try track 127.

08:05.068 --> 08:09.030
Right. Because 127 in binary code
would be a palindrome.

08:09.322 --> 08:12.450
Because the song title
is "Open the Door" by the Secret Doors.

08:17.122 --> 08:18.581
♪ OPEN THE DOOR ♪ - ♪ YEAH ♪

08:18.873 --> 08:21.193

08:34.389 --> 08:36.808
Borchert's secret lab.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.811
That's the machine Borchert
was working on in the film.

08:44.357 --> 08:46.818
Borchert's gold.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.571
We need to get this upstairs.

08:49.863 --> 08:50.905
Save Greendale.

08:56.369 --> 08:58.246
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

09:00.206 --> 09:01.875
You're Russell Borchert, aren't you?

09:03.084 --> 09:06.004
Okay, I'm gonna peel off
some Band-Aids here.

09:06.296 --> 09:07.338
Dennis Hopper is dead.

09:08.339 --> 09:10.842
TV shows give no time
for theme songs anymore.

09:11.134 --> 09:14.637
And Woody Allen did the voice
of a cartoon ant.

09:20.185 --> 09:21.352
Jeff!

09:21.644 --> 09:25.356
Sorry, I lose track
of how big I'm getting.

09:25.648 --> 09:26.691
I don't.

09:28.443 --> 09:31.863
You vandalize private property,
you nearly destroy the school...

09:32.155 --> 09:34.157
when it's finally about to make
a profit?

09:34.449 --> 09:35.533
You guys are the worst...

09:35.825 --> 09:38.369
with your stupid paintballs
and your freeze tags.

09:38.661 --> 09:41.831
- Hot Lava.
- That was Hot Lava? Dumb.

09:43.374 --> 09:45.210
Tell us where the others went.

09:47.295 --> 09:48.838
Guys, guys.

09:49.964 --> 09:50.964
What do you wanna do?

09:51.216 --> 09:52.217
What should we do?

09:52.509 --> 09:54.135
Well, what can we do?

09:55.762 --> 09:57.388
Okay.

09:57.722 --> 10:00.183
I'm gonna need you guys
to stay back...

10:00.517 --> 10:03.061
and never tell anyone
about what you saw here today.

10:19.244 --> 10:21.746
You're special, Richie.
Your mind is special.

10:22.038 --> 10:24.415
You know it works differently
from other kids' minds.

10:24.707 --> 10:27.877
Richie's a freak, Richie's a freak.

10:35.218 --> 10:36.218
Thank you.

10:36.803 --> 10:37.846
I know where they went.

10:38.471 --> 10:41.266
They climbed out to the roof,
hopped on a hang glider...

10:41.558 --> 10:45.019
and flew it across town
to that Greek restaurant. Papa Cristo's?

10:45.895 --> 10:47.564
I robbed your brain.

10:47.856 --> 10:49.107
I robbed it.

10:49.399 --> 10:52.443
Hey, we found a hatch in the floor
underneath the vending machine.

10:52.735 --> 10:55.530
- I think they went down inside it.
- Was there a hang glider?

10:58.199 --> 11:00.285
You're gonna find
a hang glider down there.

11:00.577 --> 11:01.744
That much I know.

11:02.036 --> 11:05.456
So anyway, I sealed myself up
down here with 50 years of food...

11:05.748 --> 11:08.501
50 years of toilet paper,
and 50 years of cocaine...

11:08.793 --> 11:11.254
which I somehow ran out of
after about 10 years.

11:12.005 --> 11:13.464
The '80s happened down here too.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.967
Yeah. Hey.
What are you doing with Raquel?

11:16.259 --> 11:18.469
Raquel.

11:18.761 --> 11:21.639
We're on a deadline,
and to put it bluntly, we need your gold.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.057
Raquel!

11:23.349 --> 11:27.061
- Guys, a little help. Scary fingernails?
- I'm almost done. She needs more time.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.393
Sir, Raquel has taken the best years of
your life...

11:29.480 --> 11:31.024
and a dozen of your not-so-good.

11:31.316 --> 11:34.485
If she hasn't given anything back,
it might be time to move on.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.948
Stop! You guys...

11:39.532 --> 11:40.532
what are we doing?

11:40.783 --> 11:42.493
- Saving Greendale.
- From what?

11:42.785 --> 11:46.748
We were driven down here by sellouts
with crappy values.

11:47.040 --> 11:51.085
Since when do human beings decide
which dreams are worthwhile?

11:51.377 --> 11:52.377
Look at him.

11:53.087 --> 11:54.589
He's one of us.

11:54.881 --> 11:58.426
We have to respect each other
enough...

11:59.427 --> 12:01.971
to let each other want
what we want...

12:02.847 --> 12:06.851
no matter how transparently
self-destructive...

12:07.143 --> 12:11.314
or empty our desires may be.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.526
If it was money that you guys wanted,
why didn't you say so?

12:15.818 --> 12:18.988
You can just have my leftover cash
that's under the desk over there.

12:19.280 --> 12:22.200
I don't think it's worth much.
Those are Gerald Ford dollars.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.827
- How many?
- Couple of million.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.372
Back in the '70s,
that was worth millions.

12:27.664 --> 12:28.664
Hey, I've got an idea.

12:28.915 --> 12:32.627
How about you people leave me alone
and I hereby grant that to Greendale?

12:34.796 --> 12:36.381
- What?
- Oh, my God!

12:36.673 --> 12:38.466
- Glad to hear it.
- What?

12:41.678 --> 12:43.554
Get back. This pickle's a magnet.

12:44.472 --> 12:47.141
- I'll wipe her out, man.
- Don't you dare use that on her!

12:47.433 --> 12:50.144
- See what magnets do to computers?
- No, don't do it!

12:50.436 --> 12:52.146
Get over there with them.

12:52.438 --> 12:54.148
You have no legal claim to that money.

12:54.440 --> 12:58.236
Take it up with Subway in about an hour,
after close of escrow.

12:58.528 --> 13:00.238
Chang,
you've become a bad guy again?

13:00.530 --> 13:03.533
There's a lot more to it than that, Britta.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.578
Wait, I'm not wearing a mask?

13:07.870 --> 13:10.248
There's no more to it.
I think I'm just mentally ill.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.709
All right, just stay back. All right?

13:14.460 --> 13:15.712
No, don't.

13:18.172 --> 13:19.882
No!

13:21.009 --> 13:22.969
Oh, God, no.

13:26.222 --> 13:27.390
- Hey, stop!
- Hang in there.

13:27.682 --> 13:30.768
- Open it!
- Raquel is the main operating system.

13:31.060 --> 13:35.231
She controls the door, the lights,
the shower probably, everything.

13:35.523 --> 13:38.651
And now she's dead.

13:40.028 --> 13:42.530
So we're trapped in here forever.

13:43.031 --> 13:45.283
Or just until we run out of food
and water.

13:45.575 --> 13:49.120
- At least we'll have each other.
- Till death do us part.

13:50.038 --> 13:52.623
You know what?
You guys can have my food and water.

13:55.543 --> 13:56.794
Come on, Raquel.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.086
Come on.

13:58.296 --> 14:00.048
Baby. Come on.

14:03.051 --> 14:06.304
Oh, thank God. Her emotional
components are still online.

14:06.596 --> 14:07.597
Emotional components?

14:07.889 --> 14:12.018
I have accomplished things down here
you couldn't even possibly imagine.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.812
Here, let me show you.

14:29.494 --> 14:32.080
Right there. That was it, that was it.
Did you see it?

14:34.457 --> 14:37.460
Don't you see?
This computer responds to feelings.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.587
When I started Greendale...

14:39.879 --> 14:43.674
it was for ordinary people
to be able to access technology.

14:43.966 --> 14:47.053
Wait, you started Greendale?
Do you have that in writing, anywhere?

14:47.345 --> 14:49.764
I don't know.
Somewhere with all that crap over there.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.724
But without an emotional component...

14:52.016 --> 14:54.352
computers would strip us
of all humanity...

14:54.644 --> 14:58.022
and create a society
with emotionless eggheads at the top...

14:58.314 --> 15:00.233
and idiots with feelings at the bottom.

15:00.525 --> 15:04.070
And I refuse to let that happen,
and that's why I've spent... What?

15:04.362 --> 15:06.364
- What is that?
- It's a video of a kitten.

15:07.532 --> 15:09.534
And why are those people
arguing about it?

15:09.826 --> 15:10.826
And what's that?

15:11.619 --> 15:14.163
An emoticon. That person wants
to indicate happiness...

15:14.455 --> 15:18.251
but can't convey it with language, so
they misuse punctuation to form a smile.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.629
That is so...

15:22.880 --> 15:24.173
Stupid.

15:24.465 --> 15:26.884
Only an idiot would think of this.

15:27.176 --> 15:29.554
Idiots won!

15:30.471 --> 15:33.516
Which means my work down here
is done.

15:33.808 --> 15:35.476
Good. According to what I'm seeing...

15:35.768 --> 15:39.564
if we can get you up there right now,
Subway won't be buying this school.

15:39.856 --> 15:40.982
What?

15:41.274 --> 15:42.400
What?

15:42.692 --> 15:45.570
Yeah, but it's gonna take a few hours
to get that door open...

15:45.862 --> 15:48.906
because Raquel's
logic circuits... not good.

15:49.198 --> 15:50.533
Her emotional components work.

15:50.825 --> 15:52.034
Well, in theory...

15:52.326 --> 15:57.081
a blast of human passion could shock
the mainframe into a cold start...

15:57.373 --> 15:59.417
but that's only
if somebody in this room...

15:59.709 --> 16:02.670
has feelings stronger than I get
when I rub my nipples...

16:02.962 --> 16:05.590
- so good luck with that, folks.
- Give me that.

16:06.591 --> 16:08.759
Everybody over there. Turn around.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.095
Turn around now.

16:13.598 --> 16:15.433
You're here to save me, aren't you?

16:17.185 --> 16:19.270
Let's get out of here
and never look back.

16:21.022 --> 16:23.608
In case you have to remember me,
can I give you quotes?

16:23.900 --> 16:24.942
Shut up, Abed.

16:26.694 --> 16:28.446
- Milady.
- Milord.

16:37.622 --> 16:39.916
- What did you do?
- Don't worry about it. Let's go.

16:46.672 --> 16:50.843
The city of Greendale is proud
to be selling the school of Greendale...

16:51.135 --> 16:52.135
to Subway.

16:52.345 --> 16:56.307
This brings to an end
several years of horrible management...

16:56.599 --> 16:58.851
by Dean Craig Isidore Pelton...

16:59.143 --> 17:01.145
not to throw anyone under the bus.

17:01.437 --> 17:02.980
- No.
- But he'd be the one.

17:03.272 --> 17:08.986
By my watch, it is about time to sign
these documents and make it official.

17:09.278 --> 17:10.780
Objection.

17:11.071 --> 17:13.156
I teach law at Greendale,
so believe me...

17:13.449 --> 17:15.159
I don't know much about law...

17:15.451 --> 17:18.079
but I do know a contract violation
when I see one.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.498
This is a legitimate transaction...

17:20.790 --> 17:23.166
where a city is selling a school
to a restaurant.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.627
It happens somewhere every day.

17:25.920 --> 17:28.381
Oh, the city can sell the school
all it wants...

17:28.673 --> 17:31.092
but according to his contract
with the city...

17:31.384 --> 17:35.263
the school's original founder
retains the privilege of consultation...

17:35.555 --> 17:38.516
on all future scholastic endeavours
taking place here.

17:38.808 --> 17:41.185
So Subway Sandwich University...

17:41.477 --> 17:44.605
meet your new vice dean,
Russell Borchert.

17:47.149 --> 17:48.484
Oh.

17:56.659 --> 17:57.659
Hi.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.370
I guess we're gonna be partners.

17:59.662 --> 18:01.330
I understand there's some Internet...

18:01.622 --> 18:04.208
where I can make
my inner thoughts public.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.544
Greendale the city
and Greendale the school...

18:06.836 --> 18:10.047
have some stuff to sort out,
and Subway doesn't do conflict.

18:10.339 --> 18:12.466
We do good food at good prices.

18:12.758 --> 18:16.220
We are but simple sandwich artists...

18:16.512 --> 18:19.890
- who want the world to eat fresh.
- Eat fresh!

18:20.182 --> 18:22.727
Subway, ho!

18:28.107 --> 18:29.358
Did we just save Greendale?

18:29.650 --> 18:31.819
Did we just save Greendale?

18:32.111 --> 18:34.030
No! No, you did not.

18:34.322 --> 18:37.491
You moved dirt
around Greendale's grave.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.327
Your school is still bankrupt...

18:39.619 --> 18:43.331
it is still unmarketable, and it is
still on the permanent chopping block...

18:43.623 --> 18:47.251
of anyone who has any say
in its future.

18:47.543 --> 18:51.839

two say you were gonna get married?

19:11.984 --> 19:13.778
Doesn't electrocuted
technically mean killed?

19:14.070 --> 19:17.490
- You always have to correct people?
- You always have to police correcting?

19:17.782 --> 19:20.284

- I think you mean the wedding is off.

19:20.576 --> 19:21.576
- Yeah!
- Hey, hey.

19:21.786 --> 19:25.790
Hey, I gotta say, you held up well
under that interrogation.

19:26.082 --> 19:29.794
I'm gonna tell you something that
I'd like to stay between us, huh?

19:30.086 --> 19:33.464
I was thinking about a hang glider.

19:34.465 --> 19:36.467
None of this conflict truly matters.

19:36.759 --> 19:39.637
The only owners of this land
are the Arapaho.

19:39.929 --> 19:44.892
Would it offend you if I asked you
to train me in the use of certain powers?

19:46.727 --> 19:47.727
Sorry, Carl.

19:47.978 --> 19:48.978
You deserve better.

19:49.230 --> 19:50.815
Chang, you get it.

19:51.107 --> 19:53.317
How would you like a job
on the school board?

19:53.609 --> 19:55.569
- Okay.
- Your first job...

19:55.861 --> 19:58.155
is to deliver this...

19:58.447 --> 20:01.242
- to the City Bursar's Office.
- On it.

20:03.119 --> 20:05.746
Hi, yes, I'd like to replace all my teeth
with diamonds.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.165
We live to fight another day.

20:08.457 --> 20:11.085
I never got a chance
to wish you a happy birthday.

20:11.377 --> 20:12.920
Or Halloween or Christmas...

20:13.212 --> 20:14.755
or any specific calendar event.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.174
- Well, maybe next year.
- Definitely.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.385
We'll definitely be back next year.

20:19.677 --> 20:23.222
If not, it'll be because an asteroid
has destroyed all human civilisation...

20:23.514 --> 20:24.849
and that's canon.

20:25.141 --> 20:27.184
