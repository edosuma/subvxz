DANNY:
<i>You're gonna be</i>

00:36.449 --> 00:38.082
so excited when you see this!

00:38.084 --> 00:39.517
Look at that!
What's that?

00:39.519 --> 00:42.420
What do you mean, "What is
that?" It's a smiley face.

00:42.422 --> 00:44.789
It looks like a grumpy face.
It's a smiley face!

00:44.791 --> 00:47.291
Just turn it upside
down. Go on and eat.

00:47.293 --> 00:49.193
Maybe you should stick
to making collars.

00:49.195 --> 00:51.128
That's very funny.
(laughing): Thank you.

00:51.130 --> 00:53.531
You know, it's supposed
to rain for this camping trip.

00:53.533 --> 00:54.865
You know, it's Jack's first one.

00:54.867 --> 00:56.367
Maybe you guys should postpone.
No, no, no.

00:56.369 --> 00:58.436
Rain or shine,
we go camping.

00:58.438 --> 01:00.771
I still don't get
why I can't come.

01:00.773 --> 01:02.287
Because you're not 13.
Now eat your food!

01:02.288 --> 01:04.983
Jack, is this your notebook, and why
is it not in your backpack?

01:05.244 --> 01:06.844
I have a project for
school in family history.

01:06.846 --> 01:08.279
Mm.
I have to ask Dad some questions.

01:08.281 --> 01:10.648
Family history
questions for me?

01:10.650 --> 01:13.084
No, no, no, no.
That's Gramps specialty.

01:13.086 --> 01:15.453
I can't even remember your
birthday half the time.

01:15.455 --> 01:17.021
I have some questions about you.

01:17.023 --> 01:19.557
Okay, well, ask away.
Like,

01:19.559 --> 01:21.959
what did you do
right after high school?

01:21.961 --> 01:24.795
Right after high school,
I got a job, a lot of jobs.

01:24.797 --> 01:26.764
I did construction, bartending,

01:26.766 --> 01:28.165
whatever I could
do to make money.

01:28.167 --> 01:29.767
You didn't want to become a cop?

01:29.769 --> 01:31.702
Well, I always wanted
to become a cop.

01:31.704 --> 01:33.771
I just delayed the inevitable,
I guess.

01:33.773 --> 01:34.972
(phone ringing)

01:34.974 --> 01:36.340
Hold on.

01:36.342 --> 01:38.409
Yeah, Sarge.

01:38.411 --> 01:40.344
All right, I'm on my way.

01:40.346 --> 01:42.680
I got to go. Want
to do this later?

01:42.682 --> 01:44.014
Yeah.
All right.

01:44.016 --> 01:45.483
Let's go.

01:45.485 --> 01:46.650
Yeah. See you later.
Bye.

01:46.652 --> 01:48.185
Yeah. Okay.

01:50.355 --> 01:54.892
The unnamed undercover detective
purchased the weapons

01:54.894 --> 01:57.128
from two illegal
weapons runners,

01:57.130 --> 01:59.663
who were arrested
along with ten co-defendants...

01:59.665 --> 02:01.632
Why unnamed,
Commissioner?

02:01.634 --> 02:03.768
I would think
that would be pretty clear, Bob.

02:03.770 --> 02:06.203
The term "undercover"
seems to suggests that.

02:06.205 --> 02:07.772
(laughter)

02:07.774 --> 02:09.940
The weapons originated
in Virginia

02:09.942 --> 02:13.244
with an estimated street value
of $150,000.

02:13.246 --> 02:14.646
Commissioner, why
weren't these guys

02:14.647 --> 02:16.814
stopped before they got
to New York?

02:16.816 --> 02:20.151
Because they're not breaking
the law until they arrive here

02:20.153 --> 02:22.453
and try to sell them
on the street.

02:22.455 --> 02:25.723
I want to know why I can't
get justice for my daughter.

02:25.725 --> 02:27.358
Excuse me?

02:27.360 --> 02:29.527
I-I think
you have to be more specific.

02:29.529 --> 02:32.129
My daughter
was murdered.

02:32.131 --> 02:34.398
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:34.400 --> 02:36.801
And her killer is still
out there, and you don't care!

02:36.803 --> 02:38.903
And your name?

02:38.905 --> 02:41.705
Betty Lowe... Commissioner.

02:42.641 --> 02:44.408
I wrote letters to you.
You ignored me.

02:44.410 --> 02:47.478
I want to know why I can't
get justice for my daughter!

02:47.480 --> 02:49.413
(loud murmuring)

02:49.415 --> 02:50.781
WOMAN: Commissioner?
WOMAN 2: Commissioner?

02:50.783 --> 02:52.416
MAN: Is this an open case?
(overlapping chatter)

02:52.418 --> 02:54.185
WOMAN: Commissioner, how long
has it been going on?

02:54.187 --> 02:56.053
Sorry.

02:56.055 --> 02:57.721
(overlapping chatter)

02:57.723 --> 02:59.657
BAEZ:
Lived here my whole life.

02:59.659 --> 03:01.559
I never knew
there was a military base

03:01.561 --> 03:03.160
in the middle
of New York City.

03:03.162 --> 03:04.995
Ah, you learn
something new every day.

03:04.997 --> 03:06.063
Hey, where's the victim?

03:06.065 --> 03:07.965
EMTs are attending
to her inside the house.

03:07.967 --> 03:09.099
When we got here,

03:09.101 --> 03:10.467
Military Police had already
secured the scene.

03:10.469 --> 03:11.635
What's the story?

03:11.637 --> 03:13.337
MaryAnn Russell, 27,
made the 911 call.

03:13.339 --> 03:14.905
She had been
beaten up pretty bad.

03:14.907 --> 03:17.141
We're trying to find out
the occupants of the house,

03:17.143 --> 03:18.442
see if anyone else
is involved.

03:18.444 --> 03:19.610
There's a lot of blood.

03:19.612 --> 03:20.778
BP 70 over palp.

03:20.780 --> 03:22.079
DANNY: What's going on?
What happened?

03:22.081 --> 03:24.148
Found the victim lying on
the bedroom floor, prone.

03:24.150 --> 03:25.950
Multiple contusions and
lacerations about the head.

03:25.952 --> 03:28.285
Ma'am, I'm Detective Reagan.
I'm here to help.

03:28.287 --> 03:29.653
Can you tell me
who did this?

03:29.655 --> 03:31.222
Tommy.
Tommy?

03:31.224 --> 03:32.857
Tommy did this to you?
Who's Tommy?

03:32.859 --> 03:34.525
No. My son Tommy.

03:34.527 --> 03:37.294
Okay. Where is he?
Where is your son?

03:37.296 --> 03:38.996
He's at school.

03:38.998 --> 03:42.299
Please, you need to get
to him before John does.

03:42.301 --> 03:43.634
Who's John?

03:43.636 --> 03:45.636
My husband is John Russell.

03:45.638 --> 03:47.304
Your husband--
he did this to you?

03:47.306 --> 03:48.672
(crying):
Yes, he

03:48.674 --> 03:50.307
just went crazy.
MAN: Let us get in here, please.

03:50.309 --> 03:52.543
Please, I don't care
about me. Please...

03:52.545 --> 03:55.312
Please don't let him get to my son.
We'll find

03:55.314 --> 03:57.615
your son, ma'am. Can you tell me
the last time you saw him?

03:57.617 --> 04:00.951
I made him breakfast, and
then, he took the school bus.

04:00.953 --> 04:02.219
Okay, what school?

04:02.221 --> 04:03.520
P.S. 623.

04:03.522 --> 04:05.689
I don't know if he got there.
P.S. 623.

04:05.691 --> 04:06.924
I'll check it out.

04:06.926 --> 04:08.559
Do you have any
idea where your

04:08.561 --> 04:10.160
husband would take your son,
ma'am? Go ahead.

04:10.162 --> 04:11.829
I don't know.
MAN: You can take her.

04:11.831 --> 04:12.997
He just snapped.

04:12.999 --> 04:14.598
Here we go.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.267
Detective Reagan?

04:16.269 --> 04:17.701
Sir?

04:17.702 --> 04:19.937
Major Harrison.
Okay.

04:19.939 --> 04:22.072
You ordered uniformed officers
to search this post?

04:22.074 --> 04:23.140
Yes, I did.

04:23.142 --> 04:24.909
Let me clarify
something for you.

04:24.911 --> 04:26.443
This is a military post.

04:26.445 --> 04:27.912
That means you go through me.

04:27.914 --> 04:29.113
Roger that, sir.

04:29.115 --> 04:31.315
Do you mind telling me
who we're looking for?

04:31.317 --> 04:32.983
Corporal John Russell,

04:32.985 --> 04:35.486
stationed here with his family
between tours in Afghanistan.

04:35.488 --> 04:37.554
Now CID's looking for him.

04:37.556 --> 04:40.024
That's our, uh, our Criminal
Investigation Command.

04:40.026 --> 04:41.225
I'm familiar with them.

04:41.227 --> 04:42.726
I served in the Marines.

04:42.728 --> 04:45.062
Well, then, you should understand protocol.
I understand protocol.

04:45.064 --> 04:46.463
I just don't like following it.

04:46.465 --> 04:47.932
Did Russell go AWOL?

04:47.934 --> 04:49.867
Look, we'll take it from here.

04:49.869 --> 04:51.268
I don't think so.

04:51.270 --> 04:53.437
My job's not done here until
that little boy is found.

04:53.439 --> 04:54.738
And Corporal Russell, too.

04:54.740 --> 04:56.707
You're making
a huge mistake, Detective.

04:56.709 --> 04:58.275
(garbled radio transmission)

04:58.277 --> 04:59.843
Wouldn't be the first time.

04:59.845 --> 05:01.145
Who was that?

05:01.147 --> 05:02.379
Army hard ass.

05:02.381 --> 05:04.214
Guy reminds me
of my drill sergeant.

05:04.216 --> 05:05.482
What did you get?

05:05.484 --> 05:06.583
Tommy made it to school.

05:06.585 --> 05:08.252
But I just got off
the phone with them.

05:08.254 --> 05:10.120
His father picked him up
about a half hour ago.

05:10.122 --> 05:12.723
All right, let's go
find this guy.

FRANK:
<i>And what letter</i>

05:41.977 --> 05:44.477
was she talking about, Garrett?
Come on, Frank.

05:44.479 --> 05:47.147
You know how many letters you
get requesting help with cases?

05:47.149 --> 05:49.916
Last count, about 950.
Exactly.

05:49.918 --> 05:52.018
And why didn't I see
<i>that</i> letter?

05:52.020 --> 05:54.421
She wrote five letters.
She's crazy.

05:54.423 --> 05:56.790
Is that why you had her escorted
from the room, Garrett?

05:56.792 --> 05:58.558
I was trying to protect you.

05:58.560 --> 06:01.194
You didn't seem eager to
protect me from that reporter.

06:01.196 --> 06:03.663
Sometimes I think it's the
reporters who need protecting.

06:03.665 --> 06:05.398
And how did she get in
without press credentials?

06:05.400 --> 06:08.101
She has 'em. She used to write
for an alternative weekly.

06:08.103 --> 06:09.469
Now mostly
posts online.

06:09.471 --> 06:10.870
She's written

06:10.872 --> 06:13.473
a dozen articles about the PD
and the criminal justice system

06:13.475 --> 06:16.676
as it pertains to victims'
survivors... eloquently.

06:16.678 --> 06:18.878
Because?

06:18.880 --> 06:21.915
Her daughter, Michelle,
was killed ten years ago.

06:21.917 --> 06:24.284
Frank,

06:24.286 --> 06:25.385
if we looked at every case...

06:25.387 --> 06:26.886
I want to see the letters!

06:26.888 --> 06:27.434
Why?

06:27.459 --> 06:29.457
Because next time
I'm standing up there

06:29.458 --> 06:32.525
and this comes up,
and you know it will,

06:32.527 --> 06:35.729
I damn sure want
to know the particulars.

06:36.864 --> 06:39.032
There you go, Frank. All yours.

06:39.034 --> 06:41.434
On the Fort
Totten front,

06:41.436 --> 06:43.770
Detective Reagan
is butting heads with the CO.

06:43.772 --> 06:46.072
And you're telling me this
because?

06:46.074 --> 06:49.409
Because he's overstepping,
having NYPD search the base,

06:49.411 --> 06:52.846
and interviewing personnel
without notifying CID.

06:52.848 --> 06:55.648
What are you gonna do about it?

06:55.650 --> 06:58.385
Nothing.

07:01.989 --> 07:03.857
(door opens)

07:03.859 --> 07:06.393
(door closes)

07:06.395 --> 07:08.862
(phone ringing,
indistinct chatter)

07:08.864 --> 07:11.197
Yeah, Dad.

07:11.199 --> 07:12.732
Don't forget

07:12.734 --> 07:14.834
to pick up the kerosene
for the camping trip.

07:14.836 --> 07:15.935
I'm fine.

07:15.937 --> 07:17.270
Good.

07:17.272 --> 07:20.740
Then just remember what Sister
Margaret Mary always said.

07:20.742 --> 07:23.076
You're really going to tell me
to play well with others?

07:23.078 --> 07:24.244
Yes, I am.

07:24.246 --> 07:27.147
You know that technically
this is their case.

07:27.149 --> 07:30.150
Yeah, and you and I both know
they don't have the resources.

07:30.152 --> 07:33.153
Which is why it's going
to be a <i>joint</i> investigation.

07:33.155 --> 07:34.687
(sighs)

07:34.689 --> 07:36.056
You got it, Commissioner.

07:36.058 --> 07:37.290
And why

07:37.292 --> 07:40.093
you should remember some
of her other words of advice.

07:40.095 --> 07:42.262
Never give up
without a good fight.

07:42.264 --> 07:45.432
That's not the one
I was thinking of.

07:45.434 --> 07:47.167
Reagan?

07:47.169 --> 07:49.002
Yeah, I'm dumping
Russell's cell phone.

07:49.004 --> 07:51.738
Looks like
he hasn't used it for hours.

07:51.740 --> 07:52.872
According to the school,

07:52.874 --> 07:54.641
John Russell picked up his son
at 9:45.

07:54.643 --> 07:55.842
Said he had
a doctor's appointment.

07:55.844 --> 07:57.977
That didn't raise
any red flags with them?

07:57.979 --> 07:59.279
Well, they said

07:59.281 --> 08:00.647
the parents were not divorced,

08:00.649 --> 08:02.215
and they never
had any indication

08:02.217 --> 08:03.583
that he could be a danger

08:03.585 --> 08:06.286
to his child, although his
teacher said he made this

08:06.288 --> 08:08.555
in art yesterday.

08:12.626 --> 08:16.262
Well, that certainly raises
a red flag with me.

08:18.399 --> 08:20.700
HENRY:
<i>Because</i>

08:20.702 --> 08:23.570
when my father first got here
in 1910,

08:23.572 --> 08:25.205
the Irish weren't well liked,

08:25.207 --> 08:28.441
and it was hard to get work
because a lot of businesses

08:28.443 --> 08:32.078
put out signs, "No
Irish Need Apply""

08:32.080 --> 08:33.480
Why?

08:33.482 --> 08:36.216
Uh, because we talked funny,
we dressed funny,

08:36.217 --> 08:38.051
we were poor.

08:38.053 --> 08:41.587
And back then, no one
else wanted to do jobs

08:41.590 --> 08:43.323
in the police or
fire department

08:43.325 --> 08:46.059
because they were too
dangerous and menial.

08:46.061 --> 08:48.428
And my father
had been a soldier,

08:48.430 --> 08:51.364
so he knew how to use a gun,
how to fight.

08:51.366 --> 08:52.799
He was a soldier, too?

08:52.801 --> 08:55.235
Yup.
Mm. Get you that tea, honey.

08:55.237 --> 08:56.636
(teapot whistling)

08:56.638 --> 08:58.304
First World War.

08:58.306 --> 09:01.074
Joined the Royal Air Force.

09:01.076 --> 09:02.575
Is that why you joined
the Marines, Pop?

09:02.577 --> 09:05.945
Yeah, that might have had
something to do with it.

09:05.947 --> 09:08.515
Although, my father
never talked too much

09:08.517 --> 09:10.283
about his time in the war.

09:10.285 --> 09:13.286
Neither do you.

09:13.288 --> 09:15.155
Neither does Dad.

09:15.157 --> 09:16.523
(laughs)

09:16.525 --> 09:18.558
Well, I guess that runs
in the family, too.

09:18.560 --> 09:19.826
Yeah.

09:19.828 --> 09:21.127
Here you go.
Thank you.

09:21.129 --> 09:24.264
So, what exactly
did you do in Korea?

09:24.266 --> 09:25.965
I did what I was told.

09:25.967 --> 09:27.734
Well, did you kill anyone?

09:27.736 --> 09:29.068
LINDA:
Jack...

09:32.239 --> 09:33.806
Maybe when
you're a little older,

09:33.808 --> 09:35.608
we'll have that conversation.

09:37.211 --> 09:39.212
I'm proud of my service.

09:39.214 --> 09:42.615
Let's leave it at that.

09:50.024 --> 09:53.092
(horns honking)

10:04.471 --> 10:06.573
Commissioner.

10:06.575 --> 10:08.741
Please come in.

10:17.318 --> 10:20.853
This was ten years ago.

10:22.723 --> 10:25.758
Michelle was 22,
right out of college.

10:25.760 --> 10:28.795
Just moved into her
first apartment.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.999
I was nervous

10:33.001 --> 10:36.502
about her living on
her own, like any mom.

10:36.504 --> 10:40.773
In fact, the last time
I saw her, we argued.

10:40.775 --> 10:42.809
I'm sorry, Mrs. Lowe.

10:45.079 --> 10:48.681
I wanted her to stay here.

10:48.683 --> 10:50.717
I didn't want her
to go home so late.

10:50.719 --> 10:52.552
But she left, and...

10:52.554 --> 10:56.956
well, that's the last time
I saw her alive.

10:56.958 --> 11:00.893
I read your letters.

11:00.895 --> 11:02.929
And your columns.

11:02.931 --> 11:04.564
So you...

11:04.566 --> 11:06.165
you know.

11:06.167 --> 11:07.567
I know...

11:07.569 --> 11:10.970
that her killer is
behind bars, Mrs. Lowe.

11:10.972 --> 11:13.706
Samuel Mundy is behind bars
for her murder.

11:13.708 --> 11:15.108
He's a serial killer.

11:15.110 --> 11:17.143
He may have killed
the other girls,

11:17.145 --> 11:19.445
but he did not kill Michelle.

11:19.447 --> 11:20.747
How could you know?

11:20.749 --> 11:22.982
Because I made her
promise to call me

11:22.984 --> 11:25.351
when she got home that night,
and she did.

11:25.353 --> 11:28.121
She called me to say
she was safe at home.

11:28.123 --> 11:30.757
That means she had to
have let her killer in.

11:30.759 --> 11:33.960
It had to have been someone
she knew, someone she trusted.

11:33.962 --> 11:35.762
He could have pushed his way in.

11:35.764 --> 11:40.166
The police told me that there
was no sign of forced entry.

11:40.168 --> 11:41.467
(sighs)

11:41.469 --> 11:44.337
That's hardly proof positive,
Mrs. Lowe.

11:44.339 --> 11:46.673
I know she would never
have opened the door

11:46.675 --> 11:49.275
to a complete stranger!

11:50.277 --> 11:51.511
(sighs)

11:51.513 --> 11:54.814
You're asking me to reopen
a murder investigation

11:54.816 --> 11:57.450
based on a mother's intuition.

11:59.620 --> 12:02.021
Yes, I am.

12:03.824 --> 12:08.461
I know it's hard for you
to understand, Commissioner,

12:08.463 --> 12:10.596
but you don't know
what it's like.

12:11.398 --> 12:14.534
No matter how old
your child gets,

12:14.536 --> 12:17.170
you just can't stop being a mom.

12:17.172 --> 12:19.372
And even when your child dies,

12:19.374 --> 12:23.309
you can't stop being
a mom then, either.

12:23.311 --> 12:25.311
I have a right...

12:25.313 --> 12:29.115
(crying):
to know who killed my daughter.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.790
DANNY: Look, I just need you
to answer a few questions for me

12:37.792 --> 12:40.093
about Corporal Russell.
All right, what are your questions?

12:40.095 --> 12:41.828
Does he have a
weapon on him?

12:41.830 --> 12:44.230
Corporal Russell signed out his weapon
from the armory yesterday

12:44.232 --> 12:46.833
and never returned it.
Was he suffering from PTSD?

12:46.835 --> 12:49.369
He signed this form
at the end of his last tour

12:49.371 --> 12:52.171
attesting to the fact that he is sound,
both physically and mentally.

12:52.173 --> 12:54.006
Don't you mean you talked him into
signing this at the cover-your-ass

12:54.008 --> 12:56.676
meeting where you sit him
and 50 other soldiers down

12:56.678 --> 12:59.044
and you say, "Hey, you can
go home, as long as you

12:59.069 --> 13:01.551
sign this piece of paper
"saying that the nightmare

13:01.552 --> 13:02.750
you lived through didn't
have any effect on you

13:02.751 --> 13:04.751
and it won't bother you
when you get back home"?

13:04.753 --> 13:05.913
He knew what he
was signing up for.

13:05.938 --> 13:07.388
Oh, give me a break.

13:07.389 --> 13:09.155
Did you kill anyone
on your tour? Check.

13:09.157 --> 13:10.890
Did you see dead
bodies? Check.

13:10.892 --> 13:12.330
Did you watch your buddies
bleed out and die right

13:12.355 --> 13:13.927
in front of you? Check.

13:13.928 --> 13:15.328
Did the Army help you
cope with any of this?

13:15.353 --> 13:17.131
No can do.

13:17.132 --> 13:19.799
Look, in case you haven't
noticed, this country is at war.

13:19.801 --> 13:22.168
They knew that going in;
that's what this job is.

13:22.170 --> 13:24.871
I know what the job is, okay?
And I went to those briefings,

13:24.873 --> 13:26.472
and I signed this piece
of crap myself,

13:26.474 --> 13:29.442
so I could get home to my family
just like Corporal Russell did.

13:29.444 --> 13:31.444
What do you
want me to do,

13:31.446 --> 13:33.913
stop everything to cater to a
soldier who's gone off the deep end?

13:33.915 --> 13:35.915
I'm not asking you to
change the protocol here.

13:35.917 --> 13:37.884
We already failed this guy.
I'm just asking you

13:37.886 --> 13:39.724
to help me get him
and his boy back safe.

13:39.749 --> 13:42.046
CID investigates
allegations of wrongdoing.

13:42.047 --> 13:44.057
When that investigation
is complete,

13:44.058 --> 13:45.226
we share our findings

13:45.251 --> 13:47.386
with the appropriate
military command.

13:47.629 --> 13:49.429
Military command?
The last I heard,

13:49.431 --> 13:51.431
this was a joint investigation.
Nah, a joint investigation

13:51.433 --> 13:53.933
involves more than one person,
not one person

13:53.935 --> 13:55.902
with a grudge
against the military

13:55.904 --> 13:58.438
demanding information that
we are not required to share.

13:58.440 --> 14:00.840
I don't have a grudge;
I just don't like <i>you.</i>

14:00.842 --> 14:04.444
Well, then we have found
something we have in common.

14:10.451 --> 14:11.918
Hey.
Hi.

14:11.920 --> 14:14.720
So, it looks like Russell
is paying out of pocket

14:14.722 --> 14:17.590
to see a Dr. Alex Dawson.

14:17.592 --> 14:19.058
I know that guy.

14:19.060 --> 14:21.594
That's the guy they send me to
for anger management.

14:21.596 --> 14:23.696
Guess he's not too good
at his job.

14:23.698 --> 14:25.665
That's funny. Anything
on the license plate readers?

14:25.667 --> 14:26.799
(phone rings)
No, nothing.

14:26.801 --> 14:28.634
Reagan.

14:31.138 --> 14:32.905
Yeah. Okay.

14:32.907 --> 14:35.107
The kid called 911.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.211
911. What's your emergency?
TOMMY: I'm scared.

14:38.213 --> 14:40.413
What's your name?
Tommy.

14:40.415 --> 14:43.416
What are you scared of?
My dad. I'm scared of my dad.

14:43.418 --> 14:46.085
He's been acting weird,
and I just want to go home.

14:46.087 --> 14:48.020
JOHN: What are you doing?
TOMMY: Nothing.

14:48.022 --> 14:50.223
OPERATOR: Who's with you, Tommy?
TOMMY: Oh, no!

14:50.225 --> 14:51.791
OPERATOR:
Can you tell me your location?

14:51.793 --> 14:53.125
JOHN: You're not doing nothing!
You're talking

14:53.127 --> 14:54.360
to somebody.
Give me that phone!

14:54.362 --> 14:56.162
TOMMY:
No! No!

14:56.164 --> 14:57.663
(clattering)

14:57.665 --> 15:00.166
(phone disconnects)

15:00.168 --> 15:02.235
(dial tone droning)

15:13.724 --> 15:15.358
ERIN:
<i>All right, keep me posted.</i>

15:17.360 --> 15:21.463
(sighs) So, the original prosecutor
in the Lowe case

15:21.465 --> 15:23.666
was Oliver Sheridan--
he's since passed away.

15:23.668 --> 15:27.303
But I examined all the material,
and I haven't found a red flag.

15:27.305 --> 15:29.471
(sighs) I asked
the medical examiner

15:29.473 --> 15:31.874
to take a look
at it, too.

15:31.876 --> 15:33.943
The jury came back
with a guilty verdict

15:33.945 --> 15:36.612
for Sam Mundy within two hours,
based on the evidence.

15:36.614 --> 15:38.447
He was convicted
of all three murders,

15:38.449 --> 15:40.115
including Michelle Lowe.
But he never

15:40.117 --> 15:42.192
<i>confessed</i> to the murder
of Michelle Lowe.

15:42.193 --> 15:44.866
And I don't need to tell you
that it's not unusual

15:45.056 --> 15:48.490
for a serial killer to confess
to one murder and not another.

15:48.492 --> 15:51.727
I need more than
prevailing wisdom.

15:51.729 --> 15:54.096
There was also an eyewitness

15:54.098 --> 15:57.433
who said he saw Sam Mundy
put her body into the trunk.

15:57.435 --> 15:59.468
Now, he is currently
serving time.

15:59.470 --> 16:03.806
I can reinterview him
if you want me to.

16:03.808 --> 16:05.674
Yes, I would. Thank you.

16:05.676 --> 16:07.109
I need to remind you

16:07.111 --> 16:09.044
that if I reinterview this guy

16:09.046 --> 16:11.880
and he says anything other
than his original testimony,

16:11.882 --> 16:14.750
it could throw the entire case
into question.

16:14.752 --> 16:17.920
That's three murder convictions
we're talking about.

16:17.922 --> 16:20.256
It's a huge risk.

16:20.258 --> 16:22.358
(sighs)

16:23.226 --> 16:25.928
You still want me to pursue it?

16:26.763 --> 16:28.430
I do.

16:28.432 --> 16:30.766
To what end?

16:33.303 --> 16:36.105
To prove to me that she's wrong.

16:39.943 --> 16:43.245
Did you know Pops's dad
fought in World War I?

16:43.247 --> 16:44.813
Yep.
And Pops fought

16:44.815 --> 16:47.750
in Korea, and Grandpa
fought in Vietnam,

16:47.752 --> 16:48.817
and you fought in Iraq.

16:48.819 --> 16:50.586
Yep.
LINDA: That's four generations

16:50.588 --> 16:52.588
of Reagans,
all soldiers.

16:52.590 --> 16:54.023
Yeah. Don't you
think that's cool?

16:54.025 --> 16:56.625
No, I don't
think it's cool.

16:56.627 --> 16:58.160
Danny.

16:58.162 --> 17:00.429
What? I'm saying
what I think, Linda.

17:00.431 --> 17:01.864
LINDA:
He's just saying that

17:01.866 --> 17:04.500
that's something
that you all have in common.

17:04.502 --> 17:07.202
Yeah. It's, like,
a family legacy.

17:07.204 --> 17:10.673
The family legacy is not combat,
it's service.

17:19.316 --> 17:21.183
Can you recount for me
what happened

17:21.185 --> 17:23.484
on November 21, 2004?

17:23.487 --> 17:26.954
You ever been to Gray's Papaya
on 72nd Street?

17:27.790 --> 17:29.124
Yes, I have.

17:29.126 --> 17:30.859
I used to go
in there, like,

17:30.861 --> 17:34.063
every Friday night...
get myself one of those, uh,

17:34.065 --> 17:36.432
hot dogs with cheese...

17:36.434 --> 17:38.967
and a... coconut champagne.

17:38.969 --> 17:41.136
And I used to sit by
the window and eat it

17:41.138 --> 17:44.006
and watch everybody just...
walking by.

17:44.008 --> 17:45.974
Well, you could
still be doing that

17:45.976 --> 17:48.977
if you hadn't robbed
a liquor store at gunpoint.

17:48.979 --> 17:51.080
Yeah, it's... it's a bummer.

17:51.082 --> 17:53.115
How about I answer
all your questions

17:53.117 --> 17:56.285
and you get me one of those hot dogs?
How about

17:56.287 --> 17:59.088
you cooperate
and we see how it goes?

17:59.090 --> 18:01.123
Can you tell me

18:01.125 --> 18:03.492
what happened on November 21,
please, Lamar?

18:03.494 --> 18:06.895
Well, I was, um, you know, sitting
in the window of my apartment,

18:06.897 --> 18:10.933
and I looked out and I saw this dude
stuffing a body into his trunk.

18:10.935 --> 18:12.334
And you saw the body?

18:12.336 --> 18:15.537
Well, he was trying to hold her
up, and she was stooping over.

18:15.539 --> 18:16.872
I knew she was dead.

18:16.874 --> 18:19.508
And you saw the man's
face clearly?

18:19.510 --> 18:21.043
Uh, pretty much.

18:21.045 --> 18:23.011
"Pretty much"?

18:23.013 --> 18:26.415
I, um... you know, I answered
all these questions before,

18:26.417 --> 18:28.654
you know, when I...
when I testified, so...

18:28.679 --> 18:29.786
I know.

18:29.787 --> 18:31.820
I'm just asking them again.

18:31.822 --> 18:34.423
You picked Sam Mundy
out of a photo array

18:34.425 --> 18:37.493
as the person you saw
with the body of Michelle Lowe.

18:37.495 --> 18:39.395
Yes. Yeah.

18:39.397 --> 18:40.796
So, you saw him clearly?

18:40.798 --> 18:42.364
You're sure it was Sam Mundy?

18:42.366 --> 18:43.799
Um...

18:43.801 --> 18:45.801
I-I can't get into
any more trouble, can I?

18:45.803 --> 18:50.038
(groans) Not if you
are honest with me.

18:50.040 --> 18:53.876
Well, I didn't really
see his face clearly.

18:53.878 --> 18:56.412
Why did you pick
him out, then?

18:56.414 --> 18:58.680
Because Detective Douglas
told me who to pick.

18:58.682 --> 19:00.449
The detective
told you who to pick?

19:00.451 --> 19:02.751
Well, it was more
like a suggestion.

19:02.753 --> 19:05.888
And... you followed
that suggestion?

19:05.890 --> 19:09.591
Well, I figured the police know
what they're talking about.

19:09.593 --> 19:11.360
Right?

19:14.631 --> 19:17.166
You want to tell me that
you getting mad at Jack

19:17.168 --> 19:19.968
had nothing to do with the
memories this case is bringing up?

19:19.970 --> 19:21.470
Yeah, that <i>is</i>
what I'm saying, Linda.

19:21.472 --> 19:24.106
I got a soldier who beat up his
wife and kidnapped his own son.

19:24.108 --> 19:27.709
And I want to get them home safe
before someone else gets hurt, okay?

19:27.711 --> 19:29.344
That has nothing to do
with memories, Linda.

19:29.346 --> 19:31.780
It has to do with present-day
facts, which I'm dealing with.

19:31.782 --> 19:33.081
Okay. That's fine.

19:33.083 --> 19:34.950
You want to pretend
this doesn't have

19:34.952 --> 19:36.218
to do with the case,
okay, fine.

19:36.220 --> 19:37.686
You know, you've
been on a slow boil

19:37.688 --> 19:40.088
since you got home,
and I see you...

19:40.090 --> 19:42.825
I see you, Danny, I see
what's going on with you.

19:42.827 --> 19:46.929
Okay? Just don't take
it out on our son.

19:52.802 --> 19:54.101
Detective Reagan.

19:54.126 --> 19:55.822
Got a message you
wanted to talk to me.

19:56.273 --> 19:59.274
Yeah. Uh, phone call
would've worked.

19:59.276 --> 20:02.478
Oh, I had a meeting nearby;
thought I'd drop by in person.

20:02.480 --> 20:04.246
Right. Uh... appreciate it.

20:04.248 --> 20:05.781
Can we go over here?

20:05.783 --> 20:07.816
How you doing?

20:07.818 --> 20:09.685
Yeah, same old same old.

20:09.687 --> 20:11.420
Is that good or bad?

20:11.422 --> 20:12.955
Uh, little bit of both.

20:12.957 --> 20:14.490
I didn't call you about me.

20:14.492 --> 20:16.091
I'm calling
for a patient of yours,

20:16.093 --> 20:18.093
uh, Corporal John Russell.

20:18.095 --> 20:20.696
I know. And you know
I can't discuss patients.

20:20.698 --> 20:22.965
Not unless he's a threat
to himself or to others.

20:22.967 --> 20:25.400
He kidnapped his kid,
he beat up his wife--

20:25.402 --> 20:27.636
I'd say that qualifies as
the latter, wouldn't you?

20:27.638 --> 20:30.722
Doc, come on, I mean, the army's
giving me the runaround,

20:30.723 --> 20:32.377
I'm running into a brick
wall here--

20:32.402 --> 20:33.877
can't you give me something?

20:33.878 --> 20:36.845
Um... I mean, I've
only seen him twice.

20:36.847 --> 20:39.381
You only saw <i>me</i> twice,
so I know you're

20:39.383 --> 20:40.983
a quick study.

20:40.985 --> 20:44.453
Doc, I promise you, we're
on the same side here.

20:44.455 --> 20:48.524
He's still operating as if
he's in the middle of a war,

20:48.526 --> 20:51.026
instead of back home
where it's safe.

20:51.028 --> 20:52.661
The extreme vigilance,
the paranoia,

20:52.663 --> 20:55.898
all ways post-traumatic
stress disorder can manifest.

20:55.900 --> 20:58.333
(quietly): You know I
hate that word, right?

20:58.335 --> 20:59.434
"Disorder."

20:59.436 --> 21:01.103
I feel like
we're talking

21:01.105 --> 21:03.705
about a damn vending machine
instead of a soldier.

21:03.707 --> 21:05.607
Russell's done
three tours,

21:05.609 --> 21:08.310
the first one right out of high
school; it's taken its toll.

21:08.312 --> 21:10.740
I mean, is he capable
of murder, suicide, both?

21:10.765 --> 21:11.514
Well, like I said,

21:11.515 --> 21:13.015
you know,
I've only met him twice,

21:13.017 --> 21:15.250
so I really haven't had time
to break it down,

21:15.252 --> 21:17.019
but would I have
predicted this?

21:17.021 --> 21:18.220
No.

21:18.222 --> 21:20.122
Well, what kind of predictions
would you make?

21:20.124 --> 21:21.523
He shared
some symptoms--

21:21.525 --> 21:23.125
night terrors...

21:23.127 --> 21:24.493
survivor's guilt--

21:24.495 --> 21:26.428
that suggested
a certain kind of breakdown.

21:26.430 --> 21:28.196
Instinct might
lead him to...

21:28.198 --> 21:30.632
retreat to a place he felt safe.

21:30.634 --> 21:34.403
Trying to recreate a time...
he felt secure.

21:34.405 --> 21:36.939
And yes, if he had described
such a place to me,

21:36.941 --> 21:39.608
I would tell you--
but he didn't.

21:40.443 --> 21:42.110
(quiet sigh)

21:42.112 --> 21:44.613
Can I ask again...

21:44.615 --> 21:47.182
how you're holding up?

21:48.384 --> 21:50.052
Sure.

21:50.054 --> 21:51.687
I just did.

21:55.825 --> 21:58.594
Irritable,
controlling...

21:58.596 --> 22:01.897
throwing yourself into work
at the expense of everything else?

22:01.899 --> 22:04.266
You know me, Doc.

22:04.268 --> 22:05.734
Depressed?

22:05.736 --> 22:07.903
(sighs)

22:10.173 --> 22:12.040
I got to get back to work.

22:13.142 --> 22:14.443
For what it's worth,

22:14.445 --> 22:16.011
you don't
need to wait

22:16.013 --> 22:18.413
till you're drowning
to reach out for help.

22:18.415 --> 22:19.548
(sighs)

22:19.550 --> 22:21.917
Copy that.

22:27.857 --> 22:29.491
I went to see the witness

22:29.493 --> 22:31.693
in the Michelle Lowe murder
again.

22:31.695 --> 22:33.962
And he confirmed his testimony?

22:33.964 --> 22:37.366
He confirmed that the detective
on the case,

22:37.368 --> 22:40.936
Detective Lee Douglas,
coerced his testimony.

22:44.073 --> 22:45.407
How?

22:45.409 --> 22:48.577
He said the detective told him
who to pick

22:48.579 --> 22:49.945
out of the photo array.

22:49.947 --> 22:51.413
You believe him?

22:51.415 --> 22:55.017
He's served two years
on a five-year sentence.

22:55.019 --> 22:57.352
He's not a fan of cops.
He could be angling

22:57.354 --> 22:58.387
for a deal.

22:58.389 --> 22:59.955
You know
how these guys are in jail.

22:59.957 --> 23:01.256
They'll say anything.

23:01.258 --> 23:04.059
Yeah. So?
So if we

23:04.061 --> 23:06.595
reopen this based on him
recanting

23:06.597 --> 23:08.764
and Sam Mundy's lawyers
get wind of it,

23:08.766 --> 23:12.234
they will file an appeal faster
than you can say "mistrial."

23:12.236 --> 23:14.903
You think
we should leave it alone.

23:14.905 --> 23:16.104
After I spoke

23:16.106 --> 23:17.839
to the witness, yes.

23:17.841 --> 23:20.442
But then I went
to see Betty Lowe.

23:22.145 --> 23:24.312
She's quite compelling.

23:29.852 --> 23:32.954
This last tour,
I kissed my husband good-bye

23:32.956 --> 23:34.589
and a stranger came back.

23:34.591 --> 23:35.657
How so?

23:35.659 --> 23:37.859
He's been obsessed
with our safety

23:37.861 --> 23:39.661
like he's living
in a war zone here.

23:39.663 --> 23:43.131
In Afghanistan, he
was part of a unit

23:43.133 --> 23:45.067
that was scouting for IEDs.

23:45.069 --> 23:47.269
He's been home four months now

23:47.271 --> 23:49.204
and, still,
when we're out in the car,

23:49.206 --> 23:51.206
I see him checking,

23:51.208 --> 23:54.042
like he doesn't realize
he's home.

23:54.044 --> 23:55.577
What set him off?

23:55.579 --> 23:58.547
I asked for a divorce.

23:59.515 --> 24:01.016
I just can't

24:01.018 --> 24:02.484
take it anymore.

24:02.486 --> 24:05.053
Do you have any idea
where he would've taken Tommy?

24:05.055 --> 24:07.689
Maybe his parents' house.
No, we checked.

24:07.691 --> 24:10.992
What about friends, relatives?
Anybody you can think of?

24:11.894 --> 24:13.862
His friend Lyle.

24:13.864 --> 24:15.764
He lives in Douglaston,
on the water.

24:15.766 --> 24:18.066
He was in John's unit
on his first tour.

24:18.068 --> 24:19.301
They've stayed close.

24:19.303 --> 24:21.603
Okay. We're gonna need
his name and address.

24:21.605 --> 24:23.105
Yes.

24:23.107 --> 24:24.372
Uh...

24:25.541 --> 24:28.376
He's the love of my life.

24:28.378 --> 24:30.178
But lately,

24:30.180 --> 24:32.948
what I've kept wanting to say
and I didn't

24:32.950 --> 24:35.817
was, "Who are you and what have
you done with my husband?"

24:35.819 --> 24:38.954
Because my husband,
he could talk to me.

24:46.596 --> 24:47.696
So you're saying
you haven't seen

24:47.698 --> 24:48.897
from him or heard from him?

24:48.899 --> 24:51.066
No.
Not even a phone call?

24:51.068 --> 24:51.895
Nope.

24:51.920 --> 24:53.920
When was the last time
you spoke to him?

24:54.104 --> 24:55.437
I don't recall.
Why do I

24:55.439 --> 24:57.038
get the feeling
you're not cooperating?

24:57.040 --> 24:59.608
Why do I feel like I'm being
treated like a criminal?

24:59.610 --> 25:00.642
Mr. Trevino,

25:00.644 --> 25:01.610
we're trying to find John

25:01.612 --> 25:03.111
before he hurts himself
or his son.

25:03.113 --> 25:06.114
Do you have any idea who
we're talking about here?

25:06.116 --> 25:08.183
You know he got
the Silver Star?

25:08.185 --> 25:10.652
Our unit got ambushed,
and John Russell crawled

25:10.654 --> 25:13.188
through an open courtyard
through machine gun fire

25:13.190 --> 25:14.856
so he can drag two
injured soldiers

25:14.858 --> 25:18.326
to safety. Does that sound like
a guy who would hurt his son?

25:18.328 --> 25:19.928
No, it doesn't.

25:19.930 --> 25:23.732
It's our job to find him
and get him what he needs.

25:23.734 --> 25:25.433
Oh, yeah? What does he need?

25:25.435 --> 25:26.668
He needs help.

25:26.670 --> 25:29.271
If I hear from him,
I'll let you know.

25:29.273 --> 25:31.873
If you think
of anything...

25:31.875 --> 25:34.676
here's my card.

25:40.316 --> 25:44.085
What makes you so sure
he's gonna lead us to Russell?

25:44.087 --> 25:46.788
They served
in the same unit together,

25:46.790 --> 25:48.023
which makes them
like brothers.

25:48.025 --> 25:49.658
I guarantee as soon
as we walked away,

25:49.660 --> 25:51.660
he either called Russell
or he's gonna go see him.

25:51.662 --> 25:55.597
Do you still keep in touch
with the guys from your unit?

25:55.599 --> 25:57.465
(sighs)
No.

25:57.467 --> 25:59.434
Why not? I thought
you'd be like brothers.

25:59.436 --> 26:00.936
Because I don't.

26:00.938 --> 26:02.237
Well, why not?

26:02.239 --> 26:05.006
Because I'm the only one
who made it home.

26:05.842 --> 26:07.876
I'm sorry.

26:08.744 --> 26:10.912
(sighs)

26:15.218 --> 26:17.452
(door opens in distance)

26:20.823 --> 26:22.390
He's moving.

26:28.531 --> 26:32.000
Taking a trip in your RV?

26:32.002 --> 26:33.301
I-I just...

26:33.303 --> 26:35.837
I just was checking.
Checking what?

26:35.839 --> 26:36.972
Why don't
you just be straight

26:36.974 --> 26:39.007
with us before you get
charged with obstruction

26:39.009 --> 26:40.542
of justice?

26:41.577 --> 26:44.679
I was going to convince John
to turn himself in.

26:44.681 --> 26:46.548
John's in there? With Tommy?

26:46.550 --> 26:47.883
Yeah.

26:47.885 --> 26:49.517
Step aside. Move.

26:49.519 --> 26:51.720
Keep an eye
on him.

27:22.718 --> 27:24.686
Clear!

27:29.392 --> 27:31.660
"Dear MaryAnn,
I'm so sorry.

27:31.662 --> 27:33.428
"I know you want to help me,
but you can't.

27:33.430 --> 27:35.263
"I love you more than anything.

27:35.265 --> 27:38.433
But I am done.
Please forgive me."

27:41.437 --> 27:43.004
(sighs)

27:52.484 --> 27:54.952
Detective Lee
Douglas, Commissioner.

27:54.954 --> 27:56.887
Thank you,
Baker.

27:59.391 --> 28:01.926
Just some stuff
on the Michelle Lowe case.

28:01.928 --> 28:03.494
Ah, that chick
that was found

28:03.496 --> 28:06.864
in the, uh, shallow
grave in Rockaway.

28:08.567 --> 28:11.302
What made you...

28:11.304 --> 28:14.672
certain that Samuel Mundy was the doer?
Same M.O.

28:14.674 --> 28:17.741
as the other victims--
both tied up with duct tape,

28:17.743 --> 28:19.443
multiple stab wounds,

28:19.445 --> 28:21.812
similar type
wounds and location.

28:21.814 --> 28:24.815
If I may, sir, why-why are we
looking into this case again?

28:24.817 --> 28:27.618
Oh, just some noise.
Nothing official.

28:27.620 --> 28:32.890
The mother is requesting
we reexamine the evidence.

28:35.126 --> 28:38.762
Oh, I'm sorry. Please, sit down.

28:38.764 --> 28:40.030
She, uh...

28:40.032 --> 28:42.633
she contacted me, too,
over the years.

28:42.635 --> 28:44.401
(grunts)

28:44.403 --> 28:45.769
What are you gonna do?

28:45.771 --> 28:46.971
She's a grieving mother.

28:46.973 --> 28:49.506
They see things differently.

28:49.508 --> 28:51.709
The case is solid, Commissioner.

28:51.711 --> 28:56.380
Except the sole eyewitness
is now saying he was coerced.

28:56.382 --> 28:58.015
He's-he's lying.

28:58.017 --> 28:59.450
Could be.

28:59.452 --> 29:00.684
We got

29:00.686 --> 29:02.653
a confessed killer behind bars.

29:02.655 --> 29:03.921
End of story.

29:03.923 --> 29:05.155
But you know
what's funny?

29:05.157 --> 29:08.492
(sighs)
All of Mundy's other victims

29:08.494 --> 29:10.628
had their hands and feet
duct-taped,

29:10.630 --> 29:13.197
and only Michelle's wrists
were duct-taped.

29:13.199 --> 29:14.365
And the wounds,

29:14.367 --> 29:18.035
on careful examination,
are more compressed,

29:18.037 --> 29:22.873
suggesting the killer
used more force.

29:22.875 --> 29:24.608
Mmm. You don't think he did it?

29:24.610 --> 29:25.576
Doesn't matter

29:25.578 --> 29:27.311
what I think, does it?

29:27.313 --> 29:28.612
What really
matters is

29:28.614 --> 29:31.181
what happened to her
and by whose hand.

29:31.183 --> 29:34.785
Sam Mundy killed Michelle Lowe

29:34.787 --> 29:36.854
as the day is long.

29:36.856 --> 29:40.090
Thanks for your cooperation.

29:42.060 --> 29:44.995
(clears throat)

29:45.864 --> 29:47.031
And good luck

29:47.033 --> 29:49.400
with your I.A. investigation.

29:50.235 --> 29:52.002
Sir?

29:52.004 --> 29:54.905
They'll be contacting you
shortly.

29:55.740 --> 29:57.341
"Chick"?

29:57.343 --> 30:00.244
That... It was just
an expression. I didn't...

30:00.246 --> 30:01.945
You're dismissed.

30:05.450 --> 30:07.651
(door closes)

30:13.591 --> 30:16.093
I told you.
He wouldn't hurt Tommy.

30:16.095 --> 30:17.861
Bet you thought he wouldn't hurt
his wife either.

30:17.863 --> 30:19.063
He's a good guy.
No,

30:19.065 --> 30:20.531
he <i>was</i> a good guy.

30:20.533 --> 30:22.666
Now he's a broken guy
who's screwed up in the head,

30:22.668 --> 30:23.967
and every second

30:23.969 --> 30:25.402
you waste playing games with me,

30:25.404 --> 30:27.538
his life and Tommy's life
are in danger.

30:27.540 --> 30:30.774
So why don't you start talking
and save me the BS war stories.

30:30.776 --> 30:32.242
It wasn't BS!

30:32.244 --> 30:33.210
You lied to me.

30:33.212 --> 30:35.045
He saved <i>me!</i>

30:36.247 --> 30:39.583
I was one of the soldiers
he saved, okay?

30:39.585 --> 30:41.585
Okay.

30:41.587 --> 30:46.056
Afghanistan is a world away now,
soldier.

30:46.058 --> 30:47.991
He's violent, he's
suicidal, he's got a gun

30:47.993 --> 30:49.593
and his eight-year-old
is with him.

30:49.595 --> 30:52.129
You want to pay your brother
back for saving your life?

30:52.964 --> 30:55.466
Help me save his.

30:59.070 --> 31:03.140
I gave him a prepaid cell phone
to use.

31:03.975 --> 31:05.843
Give me the number.

31:09.914 --> 31:12.349
JACK: I found out
that my great-great-grandfather

31:12.351 --> 31:14.284
fought in World War I,

31:14.286 --> 31:16.553
my great-grandfather in Korea,

31:16.555 --> 31:18.555
my grandfather in Vietnam

31:18.557 --> 31:20.257
and my dad in Iraq.

31:20.259 --> 31:23.594
I guess you might say I come
from a long line of warriors.

31:23.596 --> 31:24.795
(parents chuckling)

31:24.797 --> 31:27.464
Most of them
even got medals,

31:27.466 --> 31:29.133
which for some reason

31:29.135 --> 31:31.235
no one in my family talks about.

31:31.237 --> 31:34.338
And at first I thought that was
really weird, but now I think

31:34.340 --> 31:35.706
I know why.

31:35.708 --> 31:37.741
I think that when someone sees
a lot of really bad things,

31:37.743 --> 31:40.177
they just want
to keep it inside.

31:40.179 --> 31:41.612
They don't want to talk about it

31:41.614 --> 31:44.248
because they don't want
to worry the people they love.

31:44.250 --> 31:45.749
I see my dad go
to work every day,

31:45.751 --> 31:47.451
and I know he makes a difference
in someone's life

31:47.453 --> 31:49.653
every single day.

31:52.891 --> 31:55.492
I want to be just like him.

31:55.494 --> 31:58.529
(applause)

32:06.371 --> 32:07.971
JAMIE:
<i>That was a great job</i>

32:07.973 --> 32:09.973
you did, Jack.
Thanks.

32:09.975 --> 32:11.375
I'm just glad
everyone could be there,

32:11.377 --> 32:13.010
especially you.

32:13.012 --> 32:16.113
Danny's been working
round the clock.

32:16.115 --> 32:18.348
HENRY: You still looking
for that army vet?

32:18.350 --> 32:20.117
Yeah, Gramps.
It's tough

32:20.119 --> 32:22.920
going after a decorated vet
like he was a criminal.

32:22.922 --> 32:24.955
Well, technically, he
is a criminal, Gramps.

32:24.957 --> 32:27.124
But by all accounts, he was a
great father and a great husband

32:27.126 --> 32:29.293
before he went
back to the war.

32:29.295 --> 32:31.528
Problem is the war
followed him home.

32:31.530 --> 32:33.030
ERIN:
Trying to find

32:33.032 --> 32:35.265
an excuse for him?
No, I'm not.

32:35.267 --> 32:38.035
I'm just saying I don't think
he got the attention and care

32:38.037 --> 32:40.003
that he deserved
when he got back home.

32:40.005 --> 32:42.039
Still.
It's not gonna make me

32:42.041 --> 32:44.508
lose a step in going after him,
if that's what you're thinking.

32:44.510 --> 32:45.676
JAMIE:
Tough case.

32:45.678 --> 32:48.345
Yeah, it is.

32:49.214 --> 32:50.881
You're the only
one who didn't

32:50.883 --> 32:52.783
become a soldier.
How come?

32:52.785 --> 32:54.384
Just wasn't for me, bud.

32:54.386 --> 32:55.686
Why not?

32:56.688 --> 32:58.755
It's a different time, Sean.
I was convinced

32:58.757 --> 33:01.091
that going to law school
was the right thing for me.

33:01.093 --> 33:02.693
So you became a cop instead?

33:02.695 --> 33:05.662
Not instead.
I wanted to be a cop because,

33:05.664 --> 33:07.297
just like you, I grew up...

33:07.299 --> 33:10.133
watching <i>my</i> dad go out
and make a difference every day.

33:10.135 --> 33:12.369
And he still gets
some of the benefits,

33:12.371 --> 33:15.138
like getting shot at
by total strangers.

33:15.140 --> 33:16.340
Mm.

33:16.342 --> 33:17.875
(chuckles)
Have you ever

33:17.877 --> 33:19.376
been shot at, Grandpa?

33:19.378 --> 33:22.312
Oh, not everybody who serves in
the military gets shot at, Jack.

33:22.314 --> 33:23.614
But have you?

33:26.718 --> 33:27.885
Yes.

33:27.887 --> 33:30.521
Hmm. What about you, Pop?

33:30.523 --> 33:33.557
Well, if you're, uh, in
the 1st Marine Division,

33:33.559 --> 33:36.126
it's impossible to
avoid getting shot at.

33:36.961 --> 33:38.829
What about you, Dad?

33:38.831 --> 33:41.698
Yeah.

33:41.700 --> 33:43.267
Yeah.

33:43.269 --> 33:45.235
LINDA: You know what
was really fun

33:45.237 --> 33:47.804
about Jack's project
was finding out

33:47.806 --> 33:49.273
that Pops's dad
was awarded

33:49.275 --> 33:51.308
two medals
in World War I.

33:51.310 --> 33:53.410
Can you believe that?

33:53.412 --> 33:55.012
ERIN:
You mean you never knew?

33:55.014 --> 33:57.381
He never said a word.

33:57.383 --> 33:59.783
Wonder why he
kept it a secret.

33:59.785 --> 34:02.152
Because the men
in this family like to brag

34:02.154 --> 34:04.488
about everyone's
accomplishments but their own.

34:04.490 --> 34:05.923
Uncle Danny,

34:05.925 --> 34:08.190
didn't you get a medal
for your time in Fallujah?

34:10.228 --> 34:12.795
Really, Dad?

34:12.797 --> 34:14.464
He did.

34:23.341 --> 34:25.141
BAEZ: <i>Sorry for interrupting</i>
<i>your dinner, Reagan.</i>

34:25.143 --> 34:26.310
<i>We got a hit</i>

34:26.312 --> 34:28.210
on John Russell's
cell phone.

34:28.213 --> 34:30.480
It's pinging off a cell
tower a couple blocks away.

34:30.482 --> 34:31.882
Make a right up there.

34:31.884 --> 34:33.750
The signal strength is
indicating that we're close.

34:33.752 --> 34:35.052
Hello, Mrs. Russell?

34:35.054 --> 34:36.786
It's Detective Reagan.

34:36.789 --> 34:39.188
Listen, we might have tracked
John down into Long Island City.

34:39.190 --> 34:41.391
Can you tell us if there's
any place of importance

34:41.393 --> 34:43.694
to him there, or anything
of significance?

34:43.696 --> 34:45.128
Your first apartment's there?

34:45.130 --> 34:47.431
Okay, can you
give me an address?

34:47.433 --> 34:48.864
(horn blares)

34:52.570 --> 34:53.971
That's his car.

34:53.973 --> 34:56.239
Signal strength is a one,
he's got to be here.

34:56.241 --> 34:58.508
Maybe he's inside?

35:00.578 --> 35:02.279
I know where they are.

35:09.554 --> 35:11.254
Come on.

35:23.233 --> 35:24.300
Corporal Russell...

35:24.302 --> 35:25.467
It's okay.

35:25.469 --> 35:28.103
It's okay. Hey.

35:28.105 --> 35:30.139
Slow down, all right?

35:30.141 --> 35:33.943
Detective Reagan.
This is Detective Baez.

35:33.945 --> 35:35.444
Here to help you,
John, okay?

35:35.446 --> 35:36.712
I don't need help.

35:36.714 --> 35:37.846
Maybe you don't,
but Tommy...

35:37.848 --> 35:40.749
Tommy does, okay?
He looks a little scared.

35:40.751 --> 35:42.751
Tell you what: why don't you let
my partner bring him downstairs,

35:42.753 --> 35:45.020
he'll be nice
and safe there.

35:45.022 --> 35:47.389
Me and you could talk
a little bit, all right?

35:50.961 --> 35:52.161
Come over here, Tommy.

35:52.896 --> 35:55.231
Come on.

35:59.769 --> 36:01.370
I know what's going on.

36:02.539 --> 36:03.405
Okay?

36:03.407 --> 36:05.307
<i>You</i> have no idea.

36:05.309 --> 36:09.011
I did two tours
myself in Iraq.

36:09.013 --> 36:11.380
I know about the RPGs
and the IEDs.

36:11.382 --> 36:12.681
I also know about
the nightmares,

36:12.683 --> 36:14.483
the fear and the anger.

36:14.485 --> 36:15.918
And you're functioning?

36:15.920 --> 36:16.986
So are you.

36:16.988 --> 36:19.421
Do you know
how well-trained I am?

36:19.423 --> 36:22.558
Everywhere I go I'm
doing threat assessments.

36:22.560 --> 36:24.994
Soon as you walked
up onto this roof,

36:24.996 --> 36:27.096
I was already figuring
out how to take you out.

36:27.098 --> 36:28.564
I do it all
the time,

36:28.566 --> 36:31.667
with everyone I meet,
with every place.

36:31.669 --> 36:33.502
I understand where
you're coming from, John.

36:33.504 --> 36:36.338
I do. I've been
right where you are.

36:36.340 --> 36:37.373
Let's get you some help, okay?

36:37.375 --> 36:38.674
Don't move any closer.
All right,

36:38.676 --> 36:40.342
I stopped. John, I stopped.

36:40.344 --> 36:41.677
Hey.

36:42.479 --> 36:43.912
I'm stopped, all right?

36:43.914 --> 36:45.948
Things'll be
much better for me,

36:45.950 --> 36:49.485
for my son and for
my wife if I jump.

36:49.487 --> 36:50.986
No, they won't. Hey...

36:50.988 --> 36:53.789
Tommy needs you,
for years to come.

36:53.791 --> 36:55.969
Not when his father has
something wrong inside of him.

36:55.994 --> 36:56.693
Look, John,

36:56.694 --> 36:58.160
if you made it through
that hellhole over there,

36:58.162 --> 36:59.561
you can make it through this.

36:59.563 --> 37:01.630
Okay? That stuff
that's going on in you,

37:01.632 --> 37:04.199
it's-it's just a result
of the combat.

37:04.201 --> 37:05.801
It's like the worst,
most disgusting

37:05.803 --> 37:09.138
hangover in the world,
but you can get through it.

37:11.174 --> 37:12.508
You can.

37:12.510 --> 37:14.243
It's too late.

37:14.245 --> 37:15.511
It's not too late.

37:15.513 --> 37:17.279
You got people who love you
and care about you.

37:17.281 --> 37:21.350
My wife...
she wants a divorce.

37:21.352 --> 37:23.185
My kid...

37:23.187 --> 37:24.653
doesn't even know me.

37:24.655 --> 37:28.190
You'll get help. John, I'll
help you. I give you my word,

37:28.192 --> 37:30.292
I'll help you myself.

37:31.227 --> 37:34.730
This... this medal?

37:34.732 --> 37:36.832
I got it when I lost
my five best friends

37:36.834 --> 37:38.434
in a firefight.

37:38.436 --> 37:41.970
AK-47 rounds.

37:41.972 --> 37:43.405
I don't know why I survived.

37:43.407 --> 37:44.673
Maybe you survived

37:44.675 --> 37:47.076
'cause you were meant
to get back to your family.

37:48.111 --> 37:50.012
No.

37:50.014 --> 37:51.980
No, it's 'cause I was quick.

37:51.982 --> 37:53.315
You know that drill?

37:53.317 --> 37:55.017
(whispers): Yup.

37:57.120 --> 37:59.688
What are the two types of
people in this world, soldier?

37:59.690 --> 38:01.724
John, you've got to
leave that behind, man.

38:01.726 --> 38:03.625
The quick and the dead, sir.

38:03.627 --> 38:04.793
What are you?

38:04.795 --> 38:05.961
The quick.

38:05.963 --> 38:07.129
What're they?

38:07.131 --> 38:08.230
The dead.

38:08.232 --> 38:09.732
(helicopter approaching)
John, look at me.

38:09.734 --> 38:12.368
John.

38:12.370 --> 38:14.670
It's time to come home, man.

38:15.705 --> 38:17.773
I don't want to
be quick anymore.

38:20.276 --> 38:22.111
Don't do this.

38:23.113 --> 38:24.747
John!

38:27.083 --> 38:28.751
Damn it!

38:28.753 --> 38:30.786
(panting)

38:43.366 --> 38:45.567
(low, indistinct chatter)

38:48.204 --> 38:50.406
(phones ring nearby)

38:57.781 --> 39:00.048
♪

39:23.106 --> 39:26.642
I know what I'm asking you to do
is pretty much impossible.

39:27.644 --> 39:28.944
But I'm asking anyway

39:28.946 --> 39:33.048
because I think it's the
only way through this.

39:33.050 --> 39:35.317
So ask.

39:36.419 --> 39:38.420
Put your grief aside
for a moment.

39:38.422 --> 39:40.889
And let you off the hook.

39:40.891 --> 39:43.692
Mrs. Lowe, I'm
not on the hook.

39:43.694 --> 39:46.829
I'm here on my own time
and under my own speed.

39:54.737 --> 39:56.638
(exhales) The, uh...

39:56.640 --> 40:00.008
The sole witness...

40:00.010 --> 40:04.646
may have given false or
coerced testimony, but

40:04.648 --> 40:07.349
at this point, uh, we
can't substantiate that.

40:07.351 --> 40:09.685
But it's enough
to raise a question?

40:09.687 --> 40:11.954
Yes, and the
investigating detective

40:11.956 --> 40:14.423
may have closed the
case prematurely.

40:14.425 --> 40:16.091
May this, may that.

40:16.093 --> 40:17.459
Exactly.

40:17.461 --> 40:19.228
That I think there's
a shadow of a doubt

40:19.230 --> 40:21.463
where Michelle's
case is concerned.

40:25.368 --> 40:27.970
But, Mrs. Lowe...

40:27.972 --> 40:30.839
if I officially
reopen it,

40:30.841 --> 40:33.809
it means that Sam Mundy could
walk on the three murders

40:33.811 --> 40:37.880
that we are <i>certain</i>
he did commit.

40:40.817 --> 40:41.984
I understand that...

40:41.986 --> 40:46.622
And I can't justify
telling those families

40:46.624 --> 40:48.924
that the man who
killed their daughter

40:48.926 --> 40:51.426
is gonna walk on a
technicality.

40:52.595 --> 40:55.364
Don't ask me if I could.

40:56.232 --> 40:58.433
Never crossed my mind.

40:59.702 --> 41:02.738
I'm having the
case reexamined.

41:03.673 --> 41:04.840
But in-house.

41:04.842 --> 41:09.411
And if and when there
is any new information,

41:09.413 --> 41:10.812
you will hear it first,

41:10.814 --> 41:13.849
and you will hear it
directly from me.

41:16.085 --> 41:17.786
(sighs)
Thank you.

41:29.632 --> 41:30.832
DANNY:
We're here.

41:30.834 --> 41:32.134
You're late.

41:32.136 --> 41:35.270
Sorry. I had to pick up
some kerosene, Gramps.

41:35.272 --> 41:37.172
You're such a girl.
I don't like being cold.

41:37.174 --> 41:40.976
It's 6:10, Francis.
FRANK: Okay, Pop.

41:40.978 --> 41:43.278
You ready for your first
Reagan manly men camp trip?

41:43.280 --> 41:44.446
Yeah.
Glad to hear it.

41:44.448 --> 41:46.114
So what do we eat
when we're up there?

41:46.116 --> 41:48.650
Well, we usually kill a bear
and then roast it

41:48.652 --> 41:49.985
over an open fire.

41:50.853 --> 41:51.887
Don't worry,
he's kidding.

41:51.889 --> 41:53.021
Yeah, I know.

41:53.023 --> 41:54.389
But what do we actually eat?

41:54.391 --> 41:56.825
Steak. First time I went
camping, your dad told me

41:56.827 --> 41:58.627
that the campsite was
filled with deadly snakes.

41:58.629 --> 41:59.828
Come on,

41:59.830 --> 42:00.862
let's pack up.

42:00.864 --> 42:02.197
Come on, you
can help me

42:02.199 --> 42:04.499
load this stuff.
FRANK: Sorry.

42:07.070 --> 42:08.670
Hey.

42:08.672 --> 42:10.072
Hey.

42:10.074 --> 42:14.042
I read your, uh, DD5
on Corporal Russell.

42:14.044 --> 42:17.412
You're saying he decided
to come off the ledge,

42:17.414 --> 42:19.314
and then he
slipped and fell?

42:19.316 --> 42:22.551
(sighs)
Yeah.

42:22.553 --> 42:25.087
Um...

42:25.089 --> 42:27.322
I just figured, one day,
if his kid grows up

42:27.324 --> 42:29.891
and wants to know
the cause of death, he'll...

42:29.893 --> 42:32.094
he'll know it was an accident.

42:32.096 --> 42:34.796
That his old man didn't
want to kill himself,

42:34.798 --> 42:38.333
it was just part
of a big mistake.

42:39.168 --> 42:40.736
Are you okay?

42:40.738 --> 42:43.639
Yeah, I will be.

42:43.641 --> 42:45.540
Yeah.
JAMIE: Hey,

42:45.542 --> 42:46.675
don't stand there

42:46.677 --> 42:48.510
and look pretty,
let's go.

42:51.865 --> 42:53.532
Thanks, Dad.
