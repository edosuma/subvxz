Previously on "Switched at birth"...

00:02.003 --> 00:04.204
How do you say that was great?
Damn right, man.

00:04.431 --> 00:07.814
Hi, Tina Choi "Kansas city herald."
What an incredible story.

00:07.909 --> 00:10.210
And believe me, by Monday everybody
will be talking about it.

00:10.878 --> 00:12.353
- Bruce.
- Regina.

00:12.461 --> 00:14.782
Trust me, Regina, he's bad news.

00:15.698 --> 00:17.932
Is the whole freakin' world
in love with her?

00:22.469 --> 00:24.211
Have you ever been in a bad
mood a day in your life?

00:24.245 --> 00:28.081
Do you want me to apologize for being nice?

00:28.115 --> 00:30.952
- I'm really glad you came.
- Do you want to get the hell out of here?

00:30.986 --> 00:32.222
Absolutely.

00:39.363 --> 00:41.401
Hey, um,

00:41.435 --> 00:43.268
don't you have to be getting back soon?

00:43.302 --> 00:46.302
I told my parents I was staying
at my friend Simone's house.

00:46.579 --> 00:47.579
It's fine.

00:53.039 --> 00:56.043
Um, is this a bad time to do this?

00:56.077 --> 00:58.413
Because you seemed a little distracted
when we were leaving the house.

00:58.447 --> 01:00.047
It's fine. It's totally fine.

01:00.082 --> 01:01.917
Why are we talking and not kissing?

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074

01:10.329 --> 01:12.298
Do you have anything?

01:14.529 --> 01:15.529
Um...

01:16.816 --> 01:17.816
no.

01:17.905 --> 01:18.905
Do you?

01:19.241 --> 01:21.309
What, like secretly hidden in my cleavage

01:21.343 --> 01:23.344
or taped to the bottom of my shoe? No.

01:25.414 --> 01:28.048
Wait, wait. How can you not have anything?

01:29.952 --> 01:31.352
I don't know.

01:31.387 --> 01:34.121
I didn't really expect for
this to happen tonight.

01:38.325 --> 01:40.226
Okay.

01:40.261 --> 01:44.096
Well, uh, next time we'll be more prepared.

01:59.652 --> 02:00.944
Till next time.

02:02.627 --> 02:04.013
Till next time.

02:12.923 --> 02:15.225
- Dad.
- Oh.

02:15.260 --> 02:18.228
You don't look like Simone.

02:20.064 --> 02:22.199
Hello, sir.

02:37.787 --> 02:38.787
What were you thinking?

02:39.192 --> 02:40.559
- You're out till...
- You lied to us and...

02:41.430 --> 02:43.722
- You go god knows...
- You said you were with Simone and...

02:44.890 --> 02:47.626
Okay, you lied to me.

02:47.660 --> 02:49.662
And if I told you I was hanging out with Ty,

02:49.696 --> 02:51.664
you would have been like,
"hey, that's cool"?

02:51.698 --> 02:52.999
At 3:00 A.M.? Of course not.

02:53.033 --> 02:55.602
And what were you doing...

02:55.636 --> 02:57.704
Did... wait, did you have...

02:57.738 --> 02:58.939
- Were you two...
- Mom!

02:58.973 --> 03:00.941
- What are you...
- What?

03:00.975 --> 03:03.644
Can I just go to my room while you two

03:03.679 --> 03:05.012
decide how long you're gonna ground me?

03:05.047 --> 03:07.616
We're not just grounding you. We are...

03:07.650 --> 03:10.885
We're gonna think of
something much much worse.

03:10.919 --> 03:12.853
Yeah. You, to your room right now.

03:12.888 --> 03:15.022
- Go.
- Okay.

03:19.860 --> 03:21.027
What are we gonna do?

03:21.062 --> 03:22.896
Well, we can't stop her from seeing him.

03:22.930 --> 03:24.764
Oh yes we can.

03:24.798 --> 03:27.934
If we do that, we are going to
be raising Ty Jr. in a year.

03:27.969 --> 03:29.769
That's not funny.

03:29.803 --> 03:31.838
The more we forbid it

03:31.873 --> 03:33.973
the more she's gonna want him.

03:34.008 --> 03:37.877
Besides, she met him
through Daphne and Regina.

03:37.911 --> 03:39.812
He's from their old neighborhood.

03:39.847 --> 03:41.814
- So that makes it okay?
- No.

03:41.848 --> 03:45.618
She's trying to figure out
who she might have been,

03:45.652 --> 03:48.721
what kind of life she might have had.

03:48.755 --> 03:51.857
I think this is part of that.

03:51.891 --> 03:53.625
So what are we gonna do?

04:01.635 --> 04:02.835
Morning.

04:06.038 --> 04:08.640
Morning.

04:08.674 --> 04:10.041
Here you go, honey.

04:15.648 --> 04:16.815
So how long am I grounded for?

04:16.849 --> 04:20.017
- We're not grounding you.
- You're not?

04:20.053 --> 04:23.722
You'd just sneak out. Milk?

04:23.756 --> 04:26.691
Can you just get to it, please?

04:27.760 --> 04:30.595
We want Ty to come over for chili night.

04:30.630 --> 04:33.732
- Here?
- Mm-hmm.

04:33.766 --> 04:35.033
No, dad might actually kill him.

04:35.067 --> 04:36.968
Just want to get to know him better.

04:37.002 --> 04:38.869
That is so hypocritical.

04:38.904 --> 04:41.605
I dated Liam for months and
you never put him on trial.

04:41.639 --> 04:44.675
- Well, we knew Liam.
- You mean you played golf with his parents.

04:44.709 --> 04:45.942
That's what this is about.

04:45.977 --> 04:49.013
This is not about golf. And you're right.

04:49.047 --> 04:50.915
Ty is from a different neighborhood.

04:50.949 --> 04:53.885
But all the more reason
to get to know him better.

04:55.789 --> 04:57.623
Can't you just ground me?

04:57.657 --> 05:00.526
Want to keep seeing Ty,

05:00.561 --> 05:02.696
he comes to dinner.

05:10.738 --> 05:12.639
You're still not dressed?

05:12.673 --> 05:15.007
I didn't feel like it.

05:17.610 --> 05:19.778
Is this about Liam?

05:19.812 --> 05:22.614
And Emmett and Bay.

05:22.648 --> 05:25.683
And last night was dump-on-Daphne night.

05:25.718 --> 05:27.585
You'll work it out.

05:27.620 --> 05:30.889
Not if I never get dressed.

05:35.061 --> 05:37.929
Um, why don't you hang out with Toby?

05:37.964 --> 05:42.066
He didn't yell at you last night, right?

05:51.912 --> 05:54.847
Hey. What are you up to today?

05:54.882 --> 05:58.886
Oh, just playing some miniature
golf with my buddies.

05:58.920 --> 06:02.623
Oh, cool. I love miniature golf.

06:06.027 --> 06:08.729
Actually, I'm not really
playing miniature golf.

06:08.763 --> 06:11.899
Uh, I play a little poker.

06:11.933 --> 06:13.834
Oh, I play poker.

06:13.868 --> 06:15.569
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

06:15.603 --> 06:18.605
This is, um...

06:18.639 --> 06:20.640
- It's not...
- I mean it.

06:20.674 --> 06:22.842
I'm an incredible poker player.
Most deafies are.

06:22.877 --> 06:25.678
Deafies? Is that a word?

06:25.713 --> 06:27.814
Deaf people are more attuned

06:27.849 --> 06:30.850
to facial expressions, body language.

06:30.885 --> 06:33.787
- We pick up people's tells.
- Seriously?

06:33.821 --> 06:36.723
Hearing people have so much
junk vying for their attention.

06:36.757 --> 06:38.591
We can focus,

06:38.626 --> 06:41.894
zero in on facial tics, nervous scratches.

06:41.929 --> 06:43.930
It's like a superpower.

06:43.964 --> 06:45.865
You should totally come with me.

06:45.899 --> 06:47.800
Yeah?

06:47.834 --> 06:51.670
You should invite Emmett too.
He's even better than I am.

06:51.705 --> 06:53.906
Bring it. The more super powers the better.

06:55.075 --> 06:56.809
Hey, man.

06:56.843 --> 06:58.610
Awesome job last night.

07:12.626 --> 07:15.561
Do you want to come play
poker with me and Toby?

07:18.700 --> 07:21.802
Let me check with the guys and
we'll play a practice game.

07:21.837 --> 07:23.738
Hit the next one.

07:23.772 --> 07:25.006
Cool.

07:25.040 --> 07:27.975
- Honey.
- Yeah?

07:28.010 --> 07:31.612
You always find new ways to surprise me.

07:32.781 --> 07:35.650
Oh, well, then finding out
that those are not from me

07:35.684 --> 07:38.719
- should continue that trend.
- Mmm.

07:39.922 --> 07:41.789
They're from Bruce.

07:41.823 --> 07:43.924
And they're not for me.

07:45.794 --> 07:47.762
Oh.

07:49.699 --> 07:51.934
Thanks. Let me get
these in some water.

07:51.968 --> 07:53.836
Regina, I thought you might like to know

07:53.870 --> 07:56.773
that this Bruce is quite a player.

07:56.807 --> 07:59.910
And I don't mean baseball. He's a "player."

07:59.944 --> 08:02.647
Yeah, I got that.

08:02.681 --> 08:05.516
He's cheated on all three of his ex-wives,

08:05.551 --> 08:06.784
including Denise.

08:06.819 --> 08:09.987
Well, luckily I have no
interest in becoming his wife.

08:10.022 --> 08:12.556
Oh.

08:12.591 --> 08:14.859
Well, why do you want to go out with him?

08:14.894 --> 08:18.830
Why would I go on a date with a man
I have no interest in marrying?

08:18.864 --> 08:20.631
Yeah. I mean, what's the point

08:20.666 --> 08:22.567
if you don't think it's gonna go anywhere?

08:24.704 --> 08:26.605
Huh.

08:26.639 --> 08:27.840
How do I put this?

08:27.874 --> 08:30.910
I'm a grown woman, he's a grown man.

08:33.948 --> 08:37.885
It's been a while since
I've had some... fun.

08:37.919 --> 08:40.688
Oh, right.

08:40.722 --> 08:42.857
Okay.

08:46.762 --> 08:49.864
You're not planning on having some fun

08:49.898 --> 08:52.033
here, are you?

08:52.067 --> 08:55.937
Well, when I moved in I believe
you said something about no rules.

08:55.971 --> 08:58.907
No rules means feel free
to change the curtains,

08:58.941 --> 09:02.844
not have sex with my friend's
ex-husband in my guest house.

09:02.878 --> 09:04.745
Oh, I'm sorry.

09:04.780 --> 09:07.682
Is there a list somewhere of who
I can and cannot socialize with?

09:07.716 --> 09:09.784
Exactly what base am I allowed to go to?

09:09.819 --> 09:13.522
I am just asking you not
to bring him back here.

09:13.557 --> 09:15.691
I may not come home with Bruce,

09:15.726 --> 09:18.795
but that's only because I live
with my mother and my daughter.

09:18.829 --> 09:21.665
Excellent. Enjoy the flowers.

09:21.699 --> 09:23.633
I will.

09:29.574 --> 09:32.009
- I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

09:32.043 --> 09:33.910
To see Ty. I find it's best

09:33.944 --> 09:36.646
to invite someone to face
a firing squad in person.

09:36.680 --> 09:39.816
- I'll take you.
- What?

09:39.850 --> 09:42.919
You want to go see Ty, I'm taking you.

09:44.054 --> 09:47.856
You want to make sure I don't stay too long.

09:54.598 --> 09:57.700
So is this gonna be like
some kind of interrogation?

09:57.734 --> 09:59.602
It's gonna be exactly like one.

09:59.636 --> 10:01.837
With cornbread and chili.

10:01.872 --> 10:04.607
Sorry, that's my dad.

10:04.641 --> 10:05.975
What, he's here?

10:06.009 --> 10:08.010
Yeah, he drove me. Don't ask.

10:08.045 --> 10:10.747
I will be there in a sec!

10:12.717 --> 10:14.784
Uh, I don't think I can do this.

10:14.819 --> 10:16.887
Well, Regina and Daphne will be there.

10:16.921 --> 10:18.789
So they'll be like human shields.

10:20.058 --> 10:22.894
Okay, look, I don't want to beg here

10:22.928 --> 10:25.730
but it was kind of an ultimatum.

10:34.807 --> 10:36.674
That was embarrassing.

10:36.709 --> 10:38.643
If you want to keep seeing this kid,

10:38.678 --> 10:40.012
we're gonna keep track of you.

10:40.046 --> 10:42.047
What is so scary about me seeing Ty?

10:43.950 --> 10:46.786
Let me explain something to
you about 19-year-old boys.

10:46.820 --> 10:50.623
They are pigs. They will tell
you whatever you want to hear.

10:50.658 --> 10:53.059
They will do whatever it
takes to get you into bed.

10:53.093 --> 10:55.928
Ty is not like that, dad.
If anything, I'm the one...

10:55.962 --> 10:57.897
- No no, sweetie, I don't want to hear.
- Okay, no, dad.

10:57.931 --> 11:00.032
- La la la la!
- You do not get to do that.
You started this.

11:00.066 --> 11:02.935
No no. You started this.

11:02.970 --> 11:05.604
By growing up?

11:07.807 --> 11:08.874
Yeah.

11:28.710 --> 11:31.145
Honey, is that the article of the party?

11:31.724 --> 11:32.724
How is it?

11:32.758 --> 11:34.525
How much champagne did you have?

11:34.560 --> 11:36.861
- My gosh, what did I say?
- I'm kidding.

11:36.895 --> 11:38.796
It's great. You look really nice.

11:38.830 --> 11:41.733
Oh, "we're all adjusting beautifully."

11:41.767 --> 11:44.736
- That's good, isn't it?
- Yeah, it's like the truth.

11:44.770 --> 11:46.772
Only better.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.579
It says we were plucked
from East Riverside...

11:53.614 --> 11:55.748
plucked like a couple of gray hairs.

11:55.783 --> 11:59.787
Shh, I'm reading how triumphantly
Daphne's managing her handicap.

11:59.821 --> 12:02.423
Exactly, like we should all applaud

12:02.457 --> 12:04.491
that she can walk and talk at the same time.

12:04.525 --> 12:06.793
It's a puff piece, not a telenovela.

12:06.827 --> 12:09.462
They keep printing articles
like this about us,

12:09.497 --> 12:11.498
it may turn into one.

12:17.573 --> 12:20.841
It's a great picture, front page too.

12:22.544 --> 12:25.713
- What do you want?
- A really big favor.

12:26.915 --> 12:29.550
No, wait, okay?

12:29.900 --> 12:32.586
"Favor." I looked it up on youtube.
Does that help? No?

12:32.621 --> 12:36.790
Okay, wait. You can't see me
apologize if you're walking away.

12:40.628 --> 12:43.763
I'm sorry I wasn't nice
Bay on Saturday night.

12:43.797 --> 12:46.432
But reverse the situation

12:46.466 --> 12:47.867
and you'd probably be equally as evil.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.635
Actually, you're dating Ty.

12:49.669 --> 12:51.870
He's not my ex but
he's very important to me.

12:51.904 --> 12:54.639
Am I being evil?

12:54.674 --> 12:56.708
You're right.

12:56.742 --> 13:00.411
And I can get onboard with you dating Liam.

13:00.445 --> 13:02.614
You're too late.
I already broke up with him.

13:02.648 --> 13:05.417
- You did?
- Yeah, happy?

13:05.451 --> 13:06.851
No.

13:06.886 --> 13:10.389
I mean, I wasn't thrilled
that you guys were together,

13:10.424 --> 13:13.693
but I'm not trying to make you miserable.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.731
It was a messed up situation all around.

13:17.766 --> 13:19.834
Agreed.

13:22.638 --> 13:26.641
So if you are cool with me and Ty...

13:26.675 --> 13:29.744
Old J.K. caught us coming home at 3:00 A.M.

13:29.778 --> 13:31.512
He make you break up with him?

13:31.546 --> 13:33.481
No.

13:33.516 --> 13:35.751
He wants to get to know him

13:35.785 --> 13:38.654
so Ty's coming over for dinner tonight.

13:38.688 --> 13:40.656
That's not gonna go well.

13:40.690 --> 13:42.857
Says the optimist of the family.

13:42.892 --> 13:44.526
I get it. You need me there.

13:44.560 --> 13:47.695
And your mom and anybody who
can talk about the weather

13:47.730 --> 13:50.498
or baseball or favorite car
washes that I've known.

13:52.835 --> 13:54.703
I'll do it for Ty.

13:54.738 --> 13:56.905
Thank you.

13:56.939 --> 13:59.675
Regina, are you going to the laundromat?

13:59.709 --> 14:01.677
- Use our machines.
- Yeah, thanks.

14:01.711 --> 14:04.446
But I can triumph
over adversity all by myself.

14:04.481 --> 14:05.814
Kathryn, did you read this article?

14:05.849 --> 14:08.384
- Thank you.
- Oh hey, Regina.

14:08.418 --> 14:09.718
Yeah, I read it. I thought it was fine.

14:09.753 --> 14:12.421
Really? The part where
they called Daphne handicapped?

14:12.456 --> 14:15.758
- Did it say that?
- Yeah, right after you plucked us
from East Riverside.

14:15.792 --> 14:17.760
I'm talking about the part
where we sound totally fine

14:17.794 --> 14:19.829
about missing out on
raising our own daughters.

14:19.863 --> 14:23.499
- Where does it say that?
- It's right here.

14:23.534 --> 14:25.635
"In a way it's the best of both worlds.

14:25.669 --> 14:28.639
Our family is stronger than ever."
I never said that.

14:28.673 --> 14:31.441
We're in the middle of suing
the hospital for emotional distress.

14:31.476 --> 14:32.776
This does not make us sound very distressed.

14:32.810 --> 14:34.811
Have that reporter talk to me next time.

14:34.846 --> 14:36.647
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

14:36.681 --> 14:39.450
I'm gonna call her right now,
ask for a follow-up article.

14:39.484 --> 14:41.552
I don't want anyone thinking
it's okay what happened to us,

14:41.587 --> 14:43.654
especially not that hospital.

14:43.689 --> 14:46.858
Did Bay tell you that
Ty is coming to dinner?

14:46.892 --> 14:48.526
Daphne did.

14:48.560 --> 14:51.462
I'm double booked with Bruce,
but I can stay till 8:00.

14:51.497 --> 14:54.565
Have you ever had Ty over for dinner?

14:54.600 --> 14:56.768
Sure, lots of times.

14:56.802 --> 14:59.637
Would you be worried if Daphne

14:59.671 --> 15:02.573
and Ty had dinner alone?

15:02.607 --> 15:05.543
Is everybody sex crazed in your world?

15:05.577 --> 15:08.713
So you're telling me I'm totally paranoid

15:08.747 --> 15:11.782
to think that the subject might have
come up between the two of them?

15:11.816 --> 15:14.785
And I'm hoping you say yes.

15:14.820 --> 15:16.854
Shouldn't you be talking to her about this?

15:17.860 --> 15:18.860
I tried but...

15:19.458 --> 15:22.661
14 seconds into it she mimes barfing

15:22.695 --> 15:24.596
and runs out of the room.

15:25.899 --> 15:28.568
Bay is fine. She's smart.

15:28.602 --> 15:30.470
It's not Bay I'm worried about.

15:30.504 --> 15:32.406
Ty is smart too.

15:32.440 --> 15:33.807
Good.

15:33.841 --> 15:36.510
Tell me more about him.

15:38.646 --> 15:41.882
Let's see, he is part cherokee.

15:41.916 --> 15:44.751
He was raised by his great-aunt.

15:44.785 --> 15:47.520
And he's a champion spades player.

15:48.922 --> 15:51.457
But that's not what you're asking.

15:55.795 --> 15:57.629
Do you think they're having sex?

15:57.663 --> 16:00.397
I don't know, Kathryn.

16:00.432 --> 16:02.633
Do you think they might be having sex?

16:02.667 --> 16:05.569
Have you seen Ty without a shirt?

16:05.604 --> 16:08.439
No. Have you?

16:08.473 --> 16:11.742
Now that's a washing machine.

16:11.777 --> 16:15.546
Now as soon as you got Wilkie figured
out you've got to give me a signal.

16:15.580 --> 16:18.449
I mean, it can't be sign language.
They'd be all over that.

16:18.483 --> 16:19.783
Wait, a signal?

16:23.555 --> 16:24.855
Yeah, I don't understand.

16:24.889 --> 16:27.757
We thought we were just
playing for ourselves.

16:27.792 --> 16:29.859
No no no. You've got to...

16:29.893 --> 16:33.662
Look, they're not gonna let two
newbies come in and clean 'em out.

16:33.697 --> 16:35.631
But they are used to me playing pretty big.

16:35.665 --> 16:39.701
So you see Wilkie bluffing,
you give me a signal.

16:39.736 --> 16:41.503
Say, take a sip of your drink.

16:41.538 --> 16:45.575
Then I bet, we score,
split the profits. See?

16:48.812 --> 16:51.581
Yeah, this isn't what we had in mind.

16:52.851 --> 16:55.686
The game is a free-for-all. Okay?

16:55.720 --> 16:58.789
Anything goes. Trust me, it's cool.

17:02.594 --> 17:06.663
Come on. It's about respect.

17:06.696 --> 17:08.565
Show them deaf people
really know how to play.

17:13.869 --> 17:15.604
How will we split the pot?

17:15.638 --> 17:17.606
50-50.

17:25.481 --> 17:26.647
Yeah, okay.

17:26.682 --> 17:29.484
I'll take a hit just to
see Wilkie get taken out.

17:29.518 --> 17:31.853
I can't wait to see his face.

17:31.887 --> 17:35.623
Oh, one more thing... if my parents ask,

17:35.657 --> 17:38.492
we are playing miniature golf.

17:38.527 --> 17:40.695
Okay?

17:48.737 --> 17:50.738
Yeah.

17:50.772 --> 17:52.573
Come in.

17:53.385 --> 17:54.385
Honey.

17:54.642 --> 17:57.844
- You have a minute?
- Dad already did the sex talk, mom.

17:57.878 --> 18:00.647
And I heard it went so well.

18:00.681 --> 18:03.784
Mom, really, sex ed taught me
all about STDs and protection.

18:03.818 --> 18:07.488
I'm not here to talk to you about that.

18:07.522 --> 18:09.590
I'm not reckless. I'm not into sexting

18:09.624 --> 18:11.693
or sending around naked
pictures of my butt or anything.

18:11.727 --> 18:13.595
All good things to hear.

18:13.629 --> 18:15.497
And if this is about love or saving myself,

18:15.531 --> 18:18.367
you've got to trust that I'm old
enough to make up my own mind.

18:18.401 --> 18:21.570
You really think that I don't have anything

18:21.604 --> 18:23.705
useful to tell you?

18:25.436 --> 18:26.436
Sorry.

18:27.769 --> 18:28.952
Go ahead.

18:36.586 --> 18:38.488
Sex.

18:38.522 --> 18:40.556
When it's with the right person

18:40.590 --> 18:42.759
it can be wonderful.

18:42.793 --> 18:45.462
Should be wonderful.

18:45.496 --> 18:47.497
I'm not saying it has to be rose petals

18:47.532 --> 18:49.800
and waffles in bed.

18:49.834 --> 18:53.470
It should be with someone who makes you feel

18:53.505 --> 18:55.773
as amazing as you are...

18:59.611 --> 19:02.747
No matter what the circumstances.

19:04.650 --> 19:06.618
Thanks, mom.

19:06.652 --> 19:10.589
Good sex is about the giving
and receiving of pleasure.

19:10.623 --> 19:12.557
And we're done.

19:20.665 --> 19:22.666
Oh hey. Hi.

19:22.700 --> 19:25.602
Hey, where are you going?
I so need to get out of here.

19:25.636 --> 19:28.405
Mini golf. We'll be back for dinner.

19:28.439 --> 19:29.839
Who's we?

19:29.874 --> 19:32.442
Me and Toby.

19:32.476 --> 19:35.579
Wow, same cover story. Different sister,
same not-so-bright brother.

19:35.613 --> 19:37.547
You know about him and...

19:37.582 --> 19:40.684
Listen to me, Daphne.
Toby plays a lot of mini golf.

19:40.718 --> 19:42.786
He doesn't always win.

19:42.820 --> 19:45.689
Last year it took all of my birthday
money to dig him out of debt.

19:45.723 --> 19:48.392
- Don't go.
- I'm not gonna bail on him.

19:48.426 --> 19:50.527
- I promised I'd help him.
- Help? What?

19:50.562 --> 19:53.564
- What are you talking about?
- Me and Emmett...

19:54.733 --> 19:56.701
Forget it.

19:56.735 --> 19:58.770
Daphne, I'm serious. This is a big mistake.

19:58.804 --> 20:01.673
- I know him a lot better than you do.
- Here we go again.

20:01.707 --> 20:04.409
Okay, no. That's not what I mean.
I'm not competing with you.

20:04.444 --> 20:06.678
- I swear, okay?
- Hello, girls.

20:06.713 --> 20:09.548
Daphne, hi.

20:12.485 --> 20:14.552
- Ready to go?
- Where are you going?

20:14.587 --> 20:16.554
I'm taking Daph to mini golf.

20:16.589 --> 20:17.889
Oh, that sounds fun.

20:17.923 --> 20:21.493
Gee, Toby, after last time
when you clubbed the windmill

20:21.528 --> 20:23.896
with your putter, I thought you
were never mini golfing again.

20:23.931 --> 20:26.499
Time and practice, Bay. I'm ready.

20:26.533 --> 20:28.735
Huh. Hope you don't get a massive sunburn.

20:28.770 --> 20:31.706
You know how hot it gets
being outside all day.

20:31.740 --> 20:33.508
We'll take sunscreen.
Thanks for your concern.

20:33.542 --> 20:36.912
- Are you guys all right?
- Both: Yeah.

20:36.946 --> 20:38.714
Daphne?

20:41.718 --> 20:43.485
Everything's great, yeah.

20:43.520 --> 20:44.820
Great.

20:44.855 --> 20:47.890
- Dinner's at 7:00.
- Toby: See ya.

20:58.092 --> 21:00.653
You know Wilkie and Haruka and Cheves.

21:00.687 --> 21:02.087
Wait, don't tell me.

21:02.122 --> 21:06.091
Do you remember I taught you
the sign for doing the nasty?

21:06.125 --> 21:08.859
Yeah, right on. This is your sister?

21:08.894 --> 21:10.895
Uh, yeah.

21:10.929 --> 21:12.663
And this is Emmett,

21:12.698 --> 21:14.732
the new drummer for guitar face.

21:14.767 --> 21:16.835
If this dude plays cards like he drums,

21:16.869 --> 21:18.770
you can say adios to your trust fund.

21:18.804 --> 21:20.104
Oh, okay.

21:20.138 --> 21:22.907
And you've got to see his bike, man.

21:22.941 --> 21:24.074
Thanks for bringing the diversity, guys.

21:24.109 --> 21:25.809
It was getting to be a lonely burden.

21:25.844 --> 21:27.978
Excuse me, I'm not diverse?

21:28.012 --> 21:29.880
Dude, you drive a hummer.
You are not diverse.

21:29.914 --> 21:33.750
Hey hey, down, kitten.
Don't make me get out the spray bottle.

21:33.784 --> 21:35.718
You see what I'm dealing with?

21:35.753 --> 21:36.987
Hey, can we get a couple of those?

21:37.021 --> 21:39.122
Did you pay your membership fees?

21:39.156 --> 21:42.960
Just add it to the rest.
Plus I need 400 for the two of them.

21:42.994 --> 21:46.063
I think the bank of Wilkie might
be getting a little overextended.

21:46.098 --> 21:48.833
I think the bank of Wilkie
is full of my money.

21:48.867 --> 21:50.034
Just give me the chips.

21:50.068 --> 21:52.170
You didn't tell us it cost money to play.

21:54.907 --> 21:56.174
Hey, I got it.

21:56.208 --> 21:59.844
Can't let a lady hang. Or my drummer.

21:59.878 --> 22:01.947
- Hey, sit down.
- All right.

22:05.852 --> 22:09.120
So just a question. Are we gonna
be signing during the game?

22:09.155 --> 22:10.889
Way to be tolerant.

22:10.923 --> 22:13.058
A.S.L. is a rich and beautiful language.

22:13.092 --> 22:17.129
Which could be used as a secret
code to cheat us out of our money.

22:17.163 --> 22:19.798
Like anyone would need
a secret code to fleece you.

22:19.833 --> 22:24.069
All right, no signing
during the poker hands.

22:24.103 --> 22:26.138
Sure.

22:47.092 --> 22:49.160
I'll raise you 20.

22:49.194 --> 22:51.762
I'm down for the count.

23:04.742 --> 23:07.912
Uh, 30.

23:07.946 --> 23:09.947
Crap attack.

23:17.957 --> 23:19.891
Let's do this.

23:20.993 --> 23:22.160
All right.

23:25.830 --> 23:27.898
And that's a flush.

23:27.933 --> 23:30.134
T-Bone taking out a hornet's
nest with a cruise missile.

23:30.168 --> 23:34.070
Watch out, he's back.

23:44.817 --> 23:46.918
- Hey.
- Hi.

23:46.953 --> 23:49.855
Abandon hope all ye who enter here.

23:49.889 --> 23:51.757
That's not funny.

23:51.791 --> 23:53.159
I was being serious.

23:53.193 --> 23:56.863
Oh, you didn't have to get me flowers.

23:56.898 --> 23:58.932
- These are for your mom.
- Oh.

23:58.967 --> 24:01.802
- Hi, Ty.
- Oh, hey.

24:01.836 --> 24:03.970
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you for having me.

24:04.005 --> 24:06.907
- You have a beautiful home.
- Thank you.

24:06.941 --> 24:08.842
These are for you.

24:08.877 --> 24:10.744
Oh, thank you so much.

24:10.779 --> 24:12.746
Looks like I got flowers after all.

24:12.780 --> 24:14.981
Yeah. Nice to see you in the light of day.

24:15.016 --> 24:19.053
Nice to see you not parked
in front of my house, sir.

24:19.088 --> 24:21.022
So, Ty, would you care for one of these?

24:21.056 --> 24:22.991
It's a test.

24:23.026 --> 24:26.762
Oh, I just want a soda. That'd be good.

24:26.797 --> 24:29.766
- Good answer.
- I'll go get it.

24:29.801 --> 24:31.702
I'm gonna go stir the chili.

24:31.736 --> 24:33.771
Make yourself at home, Ty.

24:34.973 --> 24:36.674
I'll try.

24:36.709 --> 24:40.078
- Knock knock.
- Mm, smells good.

24:40.112 --> 24:43.148
These family dinners are
becoming a regular thing.

24:43.182 --> 24:45.683
- Mm-hmm.
- Hey!

24:45.718 --> 24:46.884
Hey.

24:49.888 --> 24:51.688
No bullet holes. That's a good sign.

24:51.723 --> 24:53.890
I'm really glad you guys are here.

24:53.925 --> 24:56.092
John's not so bad.
Just don't bring up politics.

24:56.895 --> 24:59.540
- He does own guns.
- Okay.

24:59.584 --> 25:00.897
- He does.
- Where's Daphne?

25:00.931 --> 25:03.800
Off playing mini golf with Toby.

25:03.835 --> 25:06.837
- Come on, let's get this started.
- Yeah.

25:06.871 --> 25:08.973
You said she'd be here.

25:09.007 --> 25:11.008
She said she would be here.

25:11.043 --> 25:13.845
Relax, Adriana and Regina are here.

25:13.879 --> 25:15.814
We still have them outnumbered,

25:17.016 --> 25:18.884
I might drive a hummer,

25:18.918 --> 25:21.721
but I'm way too black for ultimate frisbee.

25:21.755 --> 25:23.823
That's just how it is. Okay, I'm sorry.

25:25.826 --> 25:28.061
- Guys, are we rocking or what?
- I guess.

25:28.095 --> 25:30.130
Now don't change a thing.

25:30.164 --> 25:32.966
This is the first time
I've been up in weeks.

25:33.001 --> 25:36.136
We need to get going.
We have that dinner with Ty.

25:36.170 --> 25:37.904
No no, a few more hands.

25:39.740 --> 25:40.973
It's already late. We need to go.

25:42.743 --> 25:45.778
Okay, look, I didn't want to say anything,

25:45.812 --> 25:49.849
but I owe Wilkie a little money.

25:49.883 --> 25:51.917
Not a lot,

25:51.951 --> 25:54.720
but some.

25:54.754 --> 25:56.789
All I need is a few more
hands like we've been playing

25:56.823 --> 25:58.824
and I'm in the clear.

25:58.859 --> 26:01.660
- Play without us.
- No no no.

26:01.694 --> 26:04.797
I need you guys. Come on,
you're saving my life here.

26:04.831 --> 26:07.099
Please, for your bro?

26:08.735 --> 26:11.036
Oh, and maybe you could check out Cheves.

26:11.071 --> 26:13.038
See if you could figure him out too.

26:36.030 --> 26:37.798
We're still cool, right?

26:43.171 --> 26:45.672
- Hi.
- Hello.

26:45.707 --> 26:49.743
You look amazing.

26:49.778 --> 26:52.079
- So do you.
- Thank you.

26:52.113 --> 26:53.847
Hi.

26:53.882 --> 26:56.850
Oh, this is my mom Adriana.

27:06.094 --> 27:08.829
- You speak spanish?
- A little bit.

27:08.863 --> 27:11.065
Bruce, hi.

27:11.099 --> 27:13.901
- Hello.
- So good to see you again.

27:13.935 --> 27:17.872
I'm so glad you're here. I wanted to
send a buckner bulletin to Isabelle.

27:17.906 --> 27:19.840
Is she still at the dixon drive house?

27:19.875 --> 27:22.076
I believe so.

27:22.111 --> 27:25.714
- Who's Isabelle?
- My ex-wife.

27:25.748 --> 27:29.084
And you wouldn't happen to have
Sabrina's new address would you?

27:29.119 --> 27:31.053
I'll get it to you later on, certainly.

27:31.088 --> 27:32.688
Thank you.

27:34.058 --> 27:36.860
- She's my other ex-wife.
- Right.

27:36.894 --> 27:39.963
And I know about Denise
so I think we're covered.

27:39.998 --> 27:42.899
- Hey, Bruce, what's going on?
- Hey, how are you doing, John?

27:42.934 --> 27:44.701
- Good.
- Nice article in "the herald."

27:44.735 --> 27:45.968
- Oh yeah.
- Yes, it was,

27:46.003 --> 27:49.038
except for the part about
the handicap. Not our words.

27:49.072 --> 27:51.841
Yeah well, I think that "the herald"
should consult a dictionary.

27:51.875 --> 27:54.810
Last time I checked,
straight as and a wicked jump shot

27:54.844 --> 27:57.011
didn't qualify as a handicap.

27:57.046 --> 27:58.880
- Well said.
- That's just what I've heard.

27:58.914 --> 28:01.082
I haven't had the pleasure
of meeting Daphne yet.

28:01.116 --> 28:02.817
Plenty of time for that. No rush.

28:02.852 --> 28:05.987
And I'm sure I can make that decision.

28:06.021 --> 28:07.922
Okay.

28:07.956 --> 28:09.623
- We should go. We don't want to be late.
- Yeah.

28:09.658 --> 28:11.692
Oh wait. You're leaving?

28:11.727 --> 28:12.961
Hi. You're leaving? You can't.

28:12.995 --> 28:16.730
We have a reservation.
I'm gonna go grab my wrap.

28:16.765 --> 28:19.066
I'll bring the car around.
It was nice seeing all of you again.

28:19.100 --> 28:21.769
- Mucho gusto.
- Bye, Bruce.

28:21.803 --> 28:23.037
Actually, will you excuse me?

28:23.071 --> 28:25.939
I think I should go and
help Regina find that wrap.

28:27.842 --> 28:30.676
And then there were four.

28:36.716 --> 28:38.883
How's the chili, Ty? Not too spicy for you?

28:38.918 --> 28:40.886
No sir.

28:40.920 --> 28:43.922
- Bring it on.
- Don't invite it.

28:43.957 --> 28:45.991
So Bay didn't tell me what school you go to.

28:46.026 --> 28:48.060
Actually I got my G.E.D.

28:49.580 --> 28:51.798
I was talking about college,

28:51.832 --> 28:54.701
- but it's good to know.
- John never went to college.

28:54.736 --> 28:56.871
No, I played major league baseball.

28:56.905 --> 28:58.673
It's called a career.

28:58.707 --> 29:02.643
Ty has a career too, in construction.

29:02.678 --> 29:04.011
Oh.

29:04.045 --> 29:07.949
Well, um, actually I got... I got laid off.

29:10.685 --> 29:11.986
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

29:12.020 --> 29:16.789
So no college, no job...

29:16.824 --> 29:18.057
Any plans at all?

29:18.092 --> 29:19.959
Dad, put away the waterboard, okay?

29:19.993 --> 29:22.662
Ty has a plan.

29:22.696 --> 29:25.865
It's okay. I do. I do have a plan.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.901
Great. I'm interested.

29:28.935 --> 29:31.737
Tell me.

29:34.007 --> 29:36.042
Well, I've enlisted in the army.

29:40.013 --> 29:43.048
- Well, that's, uh...
- Really.

29:43.082 --> 29:44.716
That's great.

29:46.753 --> 29:48.120
Congratulations.

29:48.154 --> 29:51.056
You honor your country by serving.

29:51.090 --> 29:53.158
Thank you.

29:54.860 --> 29:58.830
Bay, you never told us that Ty enlisted.

30:00.099 --> 30:02.868
I guess I forgot to mention it.

30:02.902 --> 30:06.772
So that's a pretty serious
time commitment, right?

30:06.807 --> 30:09.675
It's nine weeks basic training

30:09.710 --> 30:12.144
and then three years active duty.

30:12.179 --> 30:14.947
That's a long stretch.

30:14.982 --> 30:17.049
When do you head out?

30:20.054 --> 30:23.056
I leave for fort benning on Thursday.

30:37.642 --> 30:39.042
I didn't mean for it to come out that way.

30:39.077 --> 30:40.978
Cleary you didn't mean for
it to come out at all.

30:41.013 --> 30:43.981
- I was going to tell you.
- On a postcard from Afghanistan?

30:44.015 --> 30:47.617
Look, Bay, I know you don't get this,

30:47.652 --> 30:48.919
but it is the right thing for me.

30:48.953 --> 30:52.890
Your options are like Harvard or Princeton,

30:52.924 --> 30:54.925
going to Europe or volunteering
in Africa for a year.

30:54.960 --> 30:56.961
That is so unfair.

30:56.995 --> 30:59.864
No offense, but this is why
I wanted Daphne or Regina here.

30:59.898 --> 31:02.033
Because I couldn't possibly understand?

31:03.902 --> 31:07.005
Look, all the guys that I grew up with,

31:07.039 --> 31:10.041
half the guys on my crew,
they'll take any excuse

31:10.075 --> 31:12.844
to go and get drunk on some Tuesday.

31:12.879 --> 31:16.615
It's like their lives are already over
and they're just marking time.

31:16.649 --> 31:18.016
I don't want it to be like that for me.

31:18.051 --> 31:21.754
- That's not you.
- We're not the same, Bay.

31:21.788 --> 31:23.790
Look where you live, all right?

31:23.824 --> 31:25.691
Things might have been different if...

31:25.726 --> 31:28.828
If the universe hadn't tossed me
into a totally different continuum?

31:30.931 --> 31:32.832
You're actually doing this? You're gonna go?

31:35.903 --> 31:37.104
Yeah.

31:38.673 --> 31:40.975
Fine then. Go.

31:43.912 --> 31:47.683
Okay. See you later.

31:56.692 --> 31:57.959
Played out like Kanye.

32:08.703 --> 32:09.837
Uh...

32:11.673 --> 32:12.939
Come on, man. We don't have all night.
What's your bet?

32:12.974 --> 32:15.942
All right, chill, dude.

32:15.977 --> 32:18.677
I'll go for the full G.

32:18.712 --> 32:21.847
I'm not getting into this.

32:21.881 --> 32:24.717
You're betting $1000?

32:24.751 --> 32:27.753
Just compensating for an
aimless life of privilege.

32:36.796 --> 32:39.698
I'll raise you again.

32:41.701 --> 32:43.735
What do you got there, bro?

32:43.769 --> 32:46.871
- It'll cost you to find out.
- All right.

32:48.707 --> 32:50.775
Two grand.

32:50.810 --> 32:53.645
Last card.

32:57.717 --> 33:00.585
Mmm, all right.

33:00.620 --> 33:03.021
I'm in for a three with three more zeros.

33:17.837 --> 33:19.871
- I'm going all in.
- You are a wild man.

33:19.905 --> 33:21.806
Always loved that about you.

33:29.983 --> 33:31.984
Beat this flush.

33:33.920 --> 33:37.056
Sorry, bro, full house... queens over eights.

33:42.029 --> 33:45.032
Hey, I'll add it to your tab, all right?

33:51.105 --> 33:53.073
You can come back anytime.

33:57.912 --> 34:00.013
Nobody even touched the brownies.

34:00.978 --> 34:02.186
- Want one?
- No. No.

34:05.620 --> 34:07.888
I thought you'd be secretly happy.

34:07.923 --> 34:10.792
What, that that kid is going off to war?

34:10.827 --> 34:12.828
No, not that he's going off to war,

34:12.862 --> 34:15.031
just he won't be around.

34:15.065 --> 34:16.966
If it's not Ty,

34:17.001 --> 34:18.967
it's gonna be some other boy
coming around the corner.

34:19.003 --> 34:21.938
Yeah, genie's out of the bottle.

34:23.674 --> 34:26.043
Seems like I was pushing her
in that swing a week ago.

34:30.949 --> 34:34.752
Did you see her face at dinner?

34:37.789 --> 34:40.791
I used to strap her into that swing
to make sure she didn't fall out.

34:43.061 --> 34:45.897
Made her wear a helmet and elbow pads.

34:49.068 --> 34:51.835
How do I keep her from
getting her heart broken?

35:04.916 --> 35:08.819
And that pancetta,
it flavored the whole sauce.

35:08.854 --> 35:11.723
I wanted to take a bath in it.

35:11.757 --> 35:13.925
It's a shame you didn't enjoy your meal.

35:13.959 --> 35:16.060
You don't understand.

35:16.095 --> 35:18.796
My daughter does all the cooking

35:18.831 --> 35:20.732
- and she's a vegetarian.
- Ah.

35:20.766 --> 35:24.769
Do you know how many portobello mushrooms
burgers I have suffered through?

35:24.803 --> 35:27.805
Well, I'd offer you a nightcap

35:27.840 --> 35:30.041
but perhaps you'd prefer skewers instead.

35:30.075 --> 35:33.644
I'll bet you have a spare freezer
full of steaks, don't you?

35:38.082 --> 35:40.049
I also have my sons tonight.

35:40.084 --> 35:42.652
They're watching "lord of the rings"
with their friends

35:42.686 --> 35:45.721
and I doubt they're even
out of helm's deep yet.

35:45.755 --> 35:48.857
Oh, well, my place is out, that's for sure.

35:49.993 --> 35:52.060
Kind of makes you feel like
a teenager, doesn't it?

35:56.967 --> 35:59.802
You want to go park somewhere?

35:59.836 --> 36:01.570
Miss Vasquez.

36:01.605 --> 36:03.573
Don't worry about my reputation, honey.

36:03.607 --> 36:05.742
That was gone a long time ago.

36:11.984 --> 36:14.953
You know, you're the one
who kept telling me to bet.

36:14.987 --> 36:17.890
This is my fault? You're acting
like I did it on purpose.

36:17.925 --> 36:20.960
You took a drink.
I distinctly saw you take a drink.

36:20.995 --> 36:22.763
That's because I thought he was bluffing.

36:22.797 --> 36:24.665
He was always shaking his leg
when he didn't have anything.

36:24.699 --> 36:26.900
- Maybe he needed to take a leak.
- A what?

36:26.935 --> 36:28.769
A leak. A leak.

36:28.803 --> 36:30.938
You know what I don't understand?

36:30.972 --> 36:33.975
You were right all those other times.

36:34.009 --> 36:37.845
And then when I really
needed your help you blew it.

36:37.880 --> 36:39.947
It's not an actual superpower.

36:39.982 --> 36:41.682
I'm deaf, not superhuman.

36:43.018 --> 36:45.921
Do you even know how much I lost tonight?

36:45.955 --> 36:48.957
I don't know. 3,000? 4,000?

36:48.991 --> 36:51.726
Never mind.

37:21.287 --> 37:24.322
Oh, hey. Isn't it a beautiful night?

37:24.356 --> 37:27.124
Oh, how'd the rest of dinner go?

37:27.159 --> 37:29.093
Great.

37:29.128 --> 37:32.297
Until Ty happened to mention
he's leaving for the army in three days.

37:34.400 --> 37:36.301
I'm sorry.

37:36.335 --> 37:39.304
You're not even surprised.

37:39.339 --> 37:43.242
Well, it's what a lot of guys
from his neighborhood do.

37:43.276 --> 37:45.344
It's a different world than this one.

37:45.378 --> 37:48.080
So I keep hearing.

37:48.114 --> 37:50.416
You want to talk about it?

37:53.052 --> 37:55.086
Um, I'm actually just gonna head out.

37:55.121 --> 37:57.222
You know what's gonna happen
if you go there, right?

37:59.191 --> 38:01.326
Am I exuding some kind of musk?

38:01.360 --> 38:04.196
Because you are third in
line with the sex talk.

38:04.231 --> 38:09.068
Well, then I'm guessing
you've heard about being safe.

38:09.103 --> 38:12.038
Yes and how the person needs
to love and respect me

38:12.073 --> 38:13.140
and how I'm way too young to...

38:13.174 --> 38:16.143
Okay, I'm not gonna tell
you that you shouldn't go.

38:16.178 --> 38:18.212
Well, there's a twist.

38:18.247 --> 38:20.348
You're never gonna believe
anything I say anyway.

38:20.382 --> 38:24.152
That much I remember.

38:24.186 --> 38:27.221
But I also remember

38:27.256 --> 38:29.157
thinking that there would be

38:29.192 --> 38:32.160
this magic moment at the end

38:32.194 --> 38:34.096
that would change everything.

38:34.130 --> 38:36.331
Only it never did.

38:38.101 --> 38:41.103
No matter what happens tonight,

38:41.138 --> 38:42.271
he's still going.

38:44.341 --> 38:46.310
It won't make him stay.

38:58.992 --> 39:01.193
I wanted you to have this.

39:01.228 --> 39:04.229
You can hang it up in Iraq or Afghanistan

39:04.264 --> 39:07.232
Or whatever-istan you end up.

39:07.267 --> 39:10.235
It's about time to take ax girl global.

39:10.270 --> 39:14.039
This... this is really awesome.

39:14.073 --> 39:15.140
Thank you.

39:17.142 --> 39:19.043
Listen, you know that I was...

39:19.077 --> 39:20.211
Ty, don't.

39:20.245 --> 39:23.348
Whatever big romantic
goodbye you've prepared...

39:23.382 --> 39:26.251
You did prepare one, right?

39:26.286 --> 39:28.354
Yes.

39:28.388 --> 39:30.990
Good.

39:31.025 --> 39:32.325
But I don't want to hear it.

39:32.360 --> 39:35.362
Whatever you have to say,
just say it when you get back.

39:35.397 --> 39:38.232
- Bay, I don't know...
- I mean it.

39:38.267 --> 39:42.004
Don't.

39:42.038 --> 39:46.208
Because if you lay out
the big l right now...

39:48.178 --> 39:52.149
I'm gonna be so mad at
you for doing this to me.

39:52.183 --> 39:56.187
And if you don't, I'm gonna be
mad at you for not saying it.

39:56.221 --> 39:58.356
So...

40:00.876 --> 40:01.876
All right.

40:02.094 --> 40:04.362
Then I'm just not gonna say anything.

40:26.152 --> 40:29.054
If you want to,

40:29.088 --> 40:31.156
- I have something.
- Now you have a condom?

40:31.191 --> 40:33.992
I had one the other night too.

40:34.027 --> 40:37.262
I didn't want to without you
knowing that I was leaving.

40:37.297 --> 40:39.264
I didn't want to hurt you.

40:39.299 --> 40:42.200
Well, that worked out well.

40:49.342 --> 40:51.243
I can't.

40:53.212 --> 40:55.247
I just came to say goodbye.

41:08.262 --> 41:11.063
Oh, honey.

41:11.098 --> 41:13.199
You didn't know he was leaving, did you?

41:14.368 --> 41:16.202
No.

41:16.236 --> 41:20.006
Oh, sweetheart.

41:21.175 --> 41:24.143
I'm gonna miss him so much.

41:24.178 --> 41:27.213
Oh, honey. I know.

41:29.116 --> 41:31.117
We didn't sleep together.

41:31.152 --> 41:33.253
No?

41:33.287 --> 41:36.089
Not because I didn't want to.

41:36.124 --> 41:39.125
It just didn't seem like
the right thing to do.

41:48.036 --> 41:50.338
You take care.

41:56.379 --> 41:58.280
I will miss you.

41:58.314 --> 42:01.016
Stay safe.

42:19.201 --> 42:20.968
Hey.

42:21.002 --> 42:23.070
Sorry about missing dinner last night.

42:23.105 --> 42:25.306
Apparently the whole "I'm sorry"
thing is going around.

42:29.211 --> 42:33.047
You were right about Toby... poker.

42:33.081 --> 42:34.982
Oh no, what happened?

42:35.017 --> 42:38.319
I was just trying to help,
but I think I made things a lot worse.

42:38.353 --> 42:40.254
Daphne, he did that all on his own.

42:47.061 --> 42:50.062
Hey, need help?

42:50.096 --> 42:52.998
You going to a gig or something?

42:53.032 --> 42:55.233
No, pawnshop. Got any more questions?

42:58.337 --> 43:01.072
- How much did he lose?
- He wouldn't say.

43:01.107 --> 43:03.308
That means it's really bad.
