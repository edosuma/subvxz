10:15.049 --> 10:16.354
help him let it go?

10:16.398 --> 10:17.878
It's too self-serving
if I do it.

10:19.444 --> 10:22.273
Done. In fact...Hey, Jimmy,

10:22.317 --> 10:24.406
did you dig the bullets
out of the body yet?

10:24.449 --> 10:25.755
Well, it's funny you should ask.

10:25.799 --> 10:27.409
With no exit wounds,
you'd expect

10:27.452 --> 10:29.716
to find several bullet fragments
inside, right?

10:29.759 --> 10:31.674
But you didn't?Killer must've
removed them.

10:31.718 --> 10:34.677
Probably using
some sort of, uh...Really long tweezers.

10:34.721 --> 10:37.506
Right again. And aren't you
putting the "special"

10:37.549 --> 10:40.074
in "special agent" today.
How did you guess?

10:40.117 --> 10:41.641
Well, Gibbs asked me
to do dive deep

10:41.684 --> 10:43.773
into Noah's parents'
murder case from ten years ago.

10:43.817 --> 10:45.732
Does Gibbs think the
murders are connected?

10:45.775 --> 10:47.516
Well, he will now.

10:47.559 --> 10:50.214
I mean, both parents
were shot at close range,

10:50.258 --> 10:51.825
execution style, and the bullets

10:51.868 --> 10:54.523
were removed with long tweezers.

10:54.566 --> 10:58.483
Same M.O. as our victim.Yeah. You don't
know the half of it.

10:58.527 --> 11:00.181
According to the
police report here,

11:00.224 --> 11:02.270
Noah and his sister
ran out of the house

11:02.313 --> 11:03.880
after finding
their parents' body.

11:03.924 --> 11:05.752
When police finally caught up
with them,

11:05.795 --> 11:08.058
they were out
in the middle of the road,

11:08.102 --> 11:10.147
exactly where
we found Noah's body.

11:10.191 --> 11:13.324
So, either there is a
copycat out there, or...

11:13.368 --> 11:15.544
Or the killer's back.

11:15.587 --> 11:16.893
Yeah.

11:19.461 --> 11:21.463
I can't believe Noah's dead.

11:21.506 --> 11:24.205
He was just with me last night,
punching the bag.

11:24.248 --> 11:26.294
What time did he leave?

11:26.337 --> 11:28.731
About 7:00. What happened?

11:28.775 --> 11:30.907
That's what we're
trying to find out.

11:30.951 --> 11:32.561
How long did Noah work here?

11:32.604 --> 11:34.128
About two years.

11:34.171 --> 11:36.391
We all have other gigs.
We just teach part-time.

11:36.434 --> 11:38.349
But Noah and I--
we got pretty close.

11:38.393 --> 11:39.611
I'm gonna need a list

11:39.655 --> 11:41.526
of all the students
and the staff.

11:41.570 --> 11:43.877
Did Noah have any enemies?

11:43.920 --> 11:45.705
No way. Everybody loved him.

11:45.748 --> 11:47.402
But if you're looking
for someone

11:47.445 --> 11:49.883
who's trouble in his life,
I'd start with his sister.

11:49.926 --> 11:52.537
We've been looking for her.She's got issues.

11:52.581 --> 11:54.583
Always has.What kind of issues?

11:54.626 --> 11:56.019
Well, can't hold a
job, sleeps all day,

11:56.063 --> 11:57.368
walks around the
town at night.

11:57.412 --> 11:59.544
Noah only moved in with her
to keep an eye on her.

11:59.588 --> 12:01.503
But all that did
was drag him down, too.

12:01.546 --> 12:03.592
Huh. You know where
we can find her?

12:03.635 --> 12:05.594
Like where she hangs?No clue.

12:05.637 --> 12:07.901
I never met her, ever.

12:07.944 --> 12:10.338
How do you know
so much about her-- podcast?I heard the stories,

12:10.381 --> 12:12.470
just like
everybody else in town.

12:12.514 --> 12:14.516
You make her sound like
she's some kind of urban legend.

12:14.559 --> 12:15.822
Around here, she is.

12:15.865 --> 12:18.520
Little girl finds
her parents dead,

12:18.563 --> 12:20.435
then walks the streets at night
like some zombie?

12:20.478 --> 12:22.654
Oh, did you try their place?

12:22.698 --> 12:24.526
We're keeping an eye
on their apartment.No.

12:24.569 --> 12:26.920
The house where their
parents were murdered.Well, the police said

12:26.963 --> 12:28.660
that place has been
abandoned for years.

12:28.704 --> 12:30.575
You want to talk about legends?

12:30.619 --> 12:32.447
One of them is that she has
lurked around that place

12:32.490 --> 12:33.709
ever since her
parents were killed.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.145
How's that for creepy?

12:35.189 --> 12:38.583
Nine out of ten.Yeah.

12:38.627 --> 12:41.804
It was bought and sold a few
times after the parents' murder,

12:41.848 --> 12:44.024
but could never
keep an owner.

12:44.067 --> 12:45.460
I don't think

12:45.503 --> 12:46.635
that "condemned" sign
is kidding.

12:46.678 --> 12:47.897
It's not.

12:47.941 --> 12:50.160
Rain got in, rotted everything.

12:50.204 --> 12:51.683
Yeah.

12:53.903 --> 12:56.514
Ooh!
You feel that?

12:56.558 --> 12:58.821
A hundred eyes
on the back of my neck.

12:58.865 --> 13:00.780
Rule 35, Bishop.

13:00.823 --> 13:02.564
[sighs]

13:02.607 --> 13:04.958
Yeah. Uh.

13:05.001 --> 13:07.482
Always watch the watchers.

13:11.616 --> 13:13.314
You think we should talk
to the neighbors?

13:15.316 --> 13:17.274
Not yet.

13:17.318 --> 13:19.450
You worried about what
that detective said,

13:19.494 --> 13:21.452
about people finding out

13:21.496 --> 13:23.454
there's been another murder
in this family?

13:23.498 --> 13:26.544
Well, I'm thinking, the less
everybody knows, the better.

13:28.329 --> 13:30.331
Bishop, on my six.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.860
"C.O."

13:37.904 --> 13:39.862
As in Claire O'Donnell?

13:49.654 --> 13:51.004
[lock clicks]

14:04.887 --> 14:07.977
BISHOP:
Yeah, I think this is Claire's.

14:08.021 --> 14:11.372
And yeah, I think
she may have some issues.

14:11.415 --> 14:13.113
You think?

14:13.156 --> 14:15.593
What is this place?

14:15.637 --> 14:18.161
Some kind of workroom.

14:18.205 --> 14:19.684
For what?

14:20.729 --> 14:22.731
Dollhouses?

14:22.774 --> 14:25.429
I have never seen

14:25.473 --> 14:27.344
a dollhouse like this.

14:46.973 --> 14:47.712
SLOANE:
Hey.

14:47.756 --> 14:49.932
Hmm?I'm gonna go with...

14:49.976 --> 14:51.020
murder-suicide.

14:51.064 --> 14:53.675
Jack Sloane, you are correct![whoops]

14:53.718 --> 14:56.547
And congratulations. You beat
Special Agent Torres' time

14:56.591 --> 14:58.854
by... 15 seconds!

14:58.898 --> 15:00.334
Oh, honey, I'm just warming up.

15:00.377 --> 15:01.639
Don't let me interrupt you.

15:01.683 --> 15:03.076
Hey.
Care to take a stab?

15:03.119 --> 15:04.947
No one's gotten this one right.Hey, an idea.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.514
How about some work?
We got a suspect to find.

15:06.557 --> 15:08.255
That's what we're doing.

15:08.298 --> 15:10.170
Totally working.Really? You two look like

15:10.213 --> 15:11.562
you're playing with dollhouses.

15:11.606 --> 15:13.347
They're not
dollhouses, Jethro.

15:13.390 --> 15:16.959
They're modern-day nutshells.

15:17.003 --> 15:19.396
What the hell's a nutshell?I'm glad you asked.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.877
Back in the 1940s,

15:21.921 --> 15:23.270
there was a brilliant woman

15:23.313 --> 15:26.360
by the name
of Frances Glessner Lee.

15:26.403 --> 15:27.404
KASIE:
Ah! Huge fan.

15:27.448 --> 15:30.277
A pioneer, really.DUCKY: Pioneer.

15:30.320 --> 15:32.322
Yes. Perfect word
to describe her.

15:32.366 --> 15:34.281
Okay, great lady.
Got it.

15:34.324 --> 15:37.371
She created a series
of crime scene miniatures

15:37.414 --> 15:39.242
which she called...
[soft chuckle]

15:39.286 --> 15:42.376
"The Nutshell Studies
of Unexplained Death."

15:42.419 --> 15:44.595
They were used
to train homicide detectives

15:44.639 --> 15:47.294
and forensic students
to analyze crime scenes.

15:47.337 --> 15:48.991
Your suspect

15:49.035 --> 15:52.125
is emulating Ms. Lee's work.

15:52.168 --> 15:54.605
These reports are
all from crime scenes

15:54.649 --> 15:58.392
committed in the immediate
vicinity of Claire.

15:58.435 --> 15:59.741
And these reports

15:59.784 --> 16:01.917
became those nutshells.KASIE:
These three

16:01.961 --> 16:03.701
are solved cases.DUCKY:
And Claire is using them

16:03.745 --> 16:05.616
to sharpen her skills.

16:05.660 --> 16:07.314
For what?

16:07.357 --> 16:10.665
To construct the most personal
nutshell of all.

16:12.623 --> 16:16.192
Ah, her parents' crime scene.

16:16.236 --> 16:18.890
DUCKY:
Indeed. This is
the only unsolved

16:18.934 --> 16:21.328
crime scene nutshell here.

16:21.371 --> 16:23.808
Claire is using this

16:23.852 --> 16:25.375
to find her
parents' killer.

16:25.419 --> 16:28.074
Tell me what I'm looking at.

16:28.117 --> 16:29.727
The same thing that Claire saw
on Christmas morning

16:29.771 --> 16:32.034
ten years ago.
She could be a hobbyist

16:32.078 --> 16:34.080
with a normal interest
in true crime.

16:34.123 --> 16:37.083
In that case, it would be only
natural that she would make

16:37.126 --> 16:39.259
a nutshell
of her own family tragedy,

16:39.302 --> 16:41.435
maybe as a way
of coping with it.KASIE: But

16:41.478 --> 16:43.872
we found these in her workbench.

16:43.915 --> 16:46.266
SLOANE:
Jimmy said that they are
the same kind of tweezers

16:46.309 --> 16:48.746
that were used to remove the
bullets from Noah's body.

16:48.790 --> 16:51.706
The evidence suggests that
Claire killed her brother

16:51.749 --> 16:54.665
in the same manner that
her parents were killed.

16:54.709 --> 16:56.363
Why?

16:56.406 --> 16:58.365
We can't speculate
as to motive, Jethro.

16:58.408 --> 17:00.367
You'll need
to get that out of her.

17:00.410 --> 17:03.283
Yeah. Working on it.DUCKY:
One more thing.

17:03.326 --> 17:05.067
You-you see that logo?

17:05.111 --> 17:08.853
I have an old friend
there that might know

17:08.897 --> 17:10.812
where Claire is.

17:13.423 --> 17:16.470
I was delighted
to hear from Dr. Mallard.

17:16.513 --> 17:20.343
I haven't seen my old friend
since our last community pool

17:20.387 --> 17:22.563
high-diving
competitions years ago.

17:22.606 --> 17:24.434
Hmm. Please tell me
you have pictures.

17:24.478 --> 17:27.089
I do. Would you
like to see them?No.

17:27.133 --> 17:28.438
Well...

17:28.482 --> 17:32.007
Claire O'Donnell.
You know her?

17:32.051 --> 17:35.054
Yeah.
She's the most recent member

17:35.097 --> 17:36.446
of our miniatures group.

17:36.490 --> 17:38.100
Why do you ask?

17:38.144 --> 17:40.059
We're trying to locate her.Well...

17:40.102 --> 17:42.844
she'll show up.
She always does.

17:42.887 --> 17:46.239
Got a feeling she's more than
a recent member of your group.

17:48.197 --> 17:49.503
I knew her parents.

17:49.546 --> 17:51.853
They were
good friends.

17:51.896 --> 17:53.202
I kept an eye

17:53.246 --> 17:56.379
on both Claire and Noah

17:56.423 --> 17:58.033
after their passing.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.383
With the ten-year anniversary
of the murders

18:00.427 --> 18:02.124
bearing down,

18:02.168 --> 18:04.648
Claire started to spiral, so
I introduced her to the group.

18:04.692 --> 18:06.476
I thought it would
give her purpose.

18:06.520 --> 18:09.088
How'd she go from dollhouses
to nutshells?

18:09.131 --> 18:11.002
Nutshell.
Uh, she came upon a book

18:11.046 --> 18:12.569
about a woman who created

18:12.613 --> 18:14.963
miniature crime scenes.Oh, yeah.

18:15.006 --> 18:16.312
We're familiar.Now, Noah's never needed

18:16.356 --> 18:18.749
much guidance,
but Claire-- she...

18:18.793 --> 18:21.361
she struggles with darkness.

18:21.404 --> 18:23.580
Her parents used to tell her,
"Come into the light,"

18:23.624 --> 18:26.322
but after their
deaths, she, uh...

18:26.366 --> 18:28.107
She was all but lost.

18:28.150 --> 18:32.023
She is so fixated on
her parents' murder.

18:32.067 --> 18:35.201
Kind of don't blame her.
She needs closure.Hmm.

18:35.244 --> 18:37.420
More than you know.
She believes

18:37.464 --> 18:39.814
that the killer isn't done
with her family, either.

18:40.771 --> 18:42.033
[phone chimes]

18:42.077 --> 18:43.774
Excuse me.
[clears throat]

18:43.818 --> 18:46.690
Ugh. Gibbs, we have a problem.DYLAN [on phone]: ...you guys,

18:46.734 --> 18:49.128
is so fleeting. These pastKid from the crime
scene posted

18:49.171 --> 18:50.781
couple of hours
have really changed methe footage he shot.

18:50.825 --> 18:52.000
as a person, and...All right, you can't
film a crime scene.

18:52.043 --> 18:54.394
Come on.DYLAN: Not cool...

18:54.437 --> 18:57.614
JIMMY:
So much for keeping Petty
Officer O'Donnell's death quiet.

18:57.658 --> 18:59.790
Yeah, Claire just went
from prime suspect

18:59.834 --> 19:02.184
to potential victim,
and we're worried

19:02.228 --> 19:04.317
all this publicity's
gonna scare her away.

19:04.360 --> 19:05.840
If a killer's after her,
maybe it's best

19:05.883 --> 19:07.450
if she just stays away.

19:07.494 --> 19:10.061
Speaking of which,
you got any new suspects?

19:10.105 --> 19:13.848
Well, maybe. Look at this
social media post I just found.

19:13.891 --> 19:15.676
It's from a neighbor
across the street

19:15.719 --> 19:17.330
from the old O'Donnell house.

19:17.373 --> 19:19.201
That is Detective Fischer.

19:19.245 --> 19:22.422
What is he doing
at Claire's old place?

19:22.465 --> 19:24.902
I don't know, but
Bishop's tracking him down now.

19:24.946 --> 19:26.730
Oh, by the way,
you can leave now.

19:26.774 --> 19:28.906
Excuse me?I know what

19:28.950 --> 19:31.518
you're really doing here.
Kasie wants my box.

19:31.561 --> 19:33.650
What?
[laughing]: What?

19:33.694 --> 19:35.304
[laughs]
No!

19:35.348 --> 19:36.871
No.
[laughs]

19:37.654 --> 19:39.221
No, I-I told her I just...

19:39.265 --> 19:40.701
I was gonna help her to...

19:40.744 --> 19:43.443
to organize... the donations.

19:43.486 --> 19:45.445
Ah. Gotcha.

19:45.488 --> 19:47.490
Well, if you're looking
to stage interventions,

19:47.534 --> 19:50.189
I suggest that you start
with Bishop.

19:51.668 --> 19:54.149
Whoa.
Nick wasn't kidding.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.456
Yeah. I don't know
if that's spring cleaning

19:56.499 --> 19:58.632
or a giant cry for help.

19:58.675 --> 20:00.721
Ooh.

20:00.764 --> 20:04.159
You know, I'm-I'm just gonna
start with this box over here.

20:04.203 --> 20:07.293
I...Oh. No. Hey!

20:07.336 --> 20:08.816
[mutters]

20:10.339 --> 20:11.862
[laughs]

20:11.906 --> 20:14.996
It's understandable for Young
McGee to be a little sad.

20:15.039 --> 20:17.477
[grunting]

20:17.520 --> 20:19.740
But this is gonna bring a lot
of joy to someone else.

20:21.742 --> 20:23.700
It's for charity...

20:23.744 --> 20:25.572
Mature McGee.

20:25.615 --> 20:27.922
I know.Yet, you're still
holding on to the box.

20:27.965 --> 20:30.794
Uh-huh.

20:30.838 --> 20:34.189
You've got bigger
problems right now.

20:37.845 --> 20:39.412
McGEE:
It's an active crime scene.

20:39.455 --> 20:41.283
Here.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.546
[phone beeps]

20:43.590 --> 20:46.549
Boss, yeah, we got
a problem here.

20:51.641 --> 20:53.513
[indistinct chatter]

20:53.556 --> 20:56.559
Back off. Keep an eye out for
Claire, get 'em off the lawn.

20:56.603 --> 20:58.300
Off the lawn!
Off the lawn! Come on.Special Agent Gibbs.

20:58.344 --> 21:01.303
NCIS.
We need you off the lawn.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.218
We're allowed to
be here, you know.Back up. Phone off.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.307
This is the site of an
active investigation.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.266
Duh. Why else would we be here?TORRES:
Because you like

21:07.309 --> 21:09.746
sick things that most people
don't even want to think about.

21:09.790 --> 21:11.792
GOTH WOMAN: Oh, please. Everyone
rubbernecks a car accident.Phone down. Down.

21:11.835 --> 21:13.489
It's a societal norm.

21:13.533 --> 21:14.838
And don't you think
a double homicide

21:14.882 --> 21:16.623
is a buttload cooler
than a fender bender?

21:16.666 --> 21:18.581
I think society should
mind their own business.It's a homicide

21:18.625 --> 21:20.888
investigation, it's
not a photo op.

21:20.931 --> 21:23.673
We're not here for photos.
We're here for Claire.[crowd voicing assent]

21:23.717 --> 21:24.892
And when she comes tonight,

21:24.935 --> 21:27.111
she'll be safe
because we're all here.

21:27.155 --> 21:28.635
Yeah, what makes you
think she's coming here?

21:28.678 --> 21:30.463
She always returns to
the scene of the crime.

21:30.506 --> 21:32.334
She came to this house
every single night for years

21:32.378 --> 21:33.857
after her parents were killed.

21:33.901 --> 21:36.120
And now,
with her brother's murder...

21:36.164 --> 21:38.427
It's only a matter of time
before she shows up.

21:38.471 --> 21:40.690
WOMAN:
That's right. [laughs softly]McGEE: If Claire

21:40.734 --> 21:42.344
always returns
to the scene of the crime...

21:42.388 --> 21:43.824
Then we're at the wrong
crime scene.

21:43.867 --> 21:45.347
Boss?Guard the house!

21:45.391 --> 21:46.827
[indistinct chatter]

21:46.870 --> 21:49.308
[muttering]

21:51.179 --> 21:53.181
[vehicle approaching]

21:56.010 --> 21:57.446
It's him. It's him.

21:57.490 --> 21:59.622
I have your gun. Noah.

21:59.666 --> 22:00.928
Noah, I have your gun.
I have your gun.

22:00.971 --> 22:02.973
I can end this.Claire?

22:03.017 --> 22:06.673
Don't come any closer.Special Agent Gibbs, NCIS.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.154
I just want to talk.I said,

22:10.198 --> 22:12.418
don't come any closer!I don't

22:12.461 --> 22:13.854
want to hurt you.

22:15.899 --> 22:17.336
Lower your weapon.

22:26.910 --> 22:28.956
Just leave me alone.

22:28.999 --> 22:31.393
Your parents would
not want this.

22:34.657 --> 22:36.616
Oh, yeah?

22:37.834 --> 22:39.923
How would you know
what they would want?

22:45.451 --> 22:48.628
They would want you to
come into the light.

22:51.848 --> 22:53.850
[soft grunt]

23:10.824 --> 23:12.695
Gibbs said he found her
on the side of the road

23:12.739 --> 23:14.610
talking to her brother?

23:14.654 --> 23:17.004
What, was she expecting
him to talk back?

23:17.047 --> 23:18.875
I don't know.

23:18.919 --> 23:22.096
But imagine finding both your
parents murdered as a child.

23:22.139 --> 23:24.098
She clearly hasn't recovered.

23:24.141 --> 23:26.361
You know, I thank
my lucky stars every day

23:26.405 --> 23:29.538
my kids were able to weather
the storm as well as they did

23:29.582 --> 23:30.800
when we lost Jackie.

23:30.844 --> 23:32.889
That wasn't luck, Leon.

23:32.933 --> 23:35.326
They still had you,
and you're a hell of a dad.

23:35.370 --> 23:37.459
Yeah, it's like every
day's a new failure.

23:37.503 --> 23:40.593
So tell me, am I looking
at a victim or a suspect?

23:40.636 --> 23:43.465
BISHOP:
Well, still trying
to figure that out.

23:43.509 --> 23:45.249
Torres is running down
where Claire says

23:45.293 --> 23:47.164
she's been the
last couple days.

23:47.208 --> 23:48.470
Apparently,
all the places she went

23:48.514 --> 23:50.472
with her parents
when they were alive.

23:50.516 --> 23:51.734
If you'll excuse me,

23:51.778 --> 23:54.476
I got a sudden urge
to call my kids.

23:54.520 --> 23:57.044
Hey, speaking of urges,

23:57.087 --> 24:00.090
I heard you've had
a major urge to purge.

24:00.134 --> 24:01.875
Oh, my God. Not you, too.

24:01.918 --> 24:04.747
I'm simplifying.Okay.

24:04.791 --> 24:08.708
But while Nick does look nice in
your Oklahoma State sweatshirt,

24:08.751 --> 24:11.537
we're simply wondering
if there's more to it than that.

24:11.580 --> 24:14.583
Well, there isn't.

24:14.627 --> 24:16.672
[door closes]

24:23.766 --> 24:25.768
Know why you're here?

24:28.205 --> 24:30.512
Claire?You want to know

24:30.556 --> 24:32.645
if I killed my brother?

24:33.689 --> 24:35.691
Did you?

24:39.129 --> 24:41.131
Yes.

24:44.091 --> 24:46.093
You gonna tell me why?

24:48.661 --> 24:51.446
Has anyone you loved
ever been killed?

24:51.490 --> 24:53.883
It's about you,
not about me.

24:53.927 --> 24:56.364
Why'd you kill
your brother?

24:58.671 --> 25:01.325
I couldn't stop thinking about

25:01.369 --> 25:02.675
our parents' murder,

25:02.718 --> 25:05.982
and I thought if I made
a nutshell about it,

25:06.026 --> 25:09.551
I could... find peace.

25:09.595 --> 25:11.771
I asked Noah to help me.

25:11.814 --> 25:14.556
He'd do anything for me.

25:14.600 --> 25:17.994
He actually... got more
into the nutshells than I did,

25:18.038 --> 25:21.520
and started digging
into our parents' case.

25:21.563 --> 25:24.958
And digging and... digging.

25:26.916 --> 25:29.179
He must have found something.

25:29.223 --> 25:32.705
Something someone didn't
want him to find.

25:39.668 --> 25:41.017
You didn't kill your brother.

25:46.066 --> 25:48.024
I might as well have.

25:48.068 --> 25:51.637
I'm the one who asked him to
help me recreate their murders.

25:53.073 --> 25:55.510
What did he find?

25:57.643 --> 25:59.601
I don't know.
He wouldn't tell me.

26:02.256 --> 26:04.650
All I know is
he's dead because of me.

26:08.305 --> 26:11.657
Noah was definitely
looking into something.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.702
I was finally able to
pull out some latent ink

26:13.746 --> 26:15.617
on these papers
you found at the crime scene.

26:15.661 --> 26:18.011
Well, looks like
an evidence custody document.

26:18.054 --> 26:19.752
Well, Claire did
say he was digging

26:19.795 --> 26:21.884
into their parents' murders.Well, digging for what?

26:21.928 --> 26:23.930
I mean, you were
in Claire's workshop.Yes.

26:23.973 --> 26:25.105
I'm still having nightmares.

26:25.148 --> 26:26.585
She already had every bit

26:26.628 --> 26:27.890
of evidence
from her parents' case.

26:27.934 --> 26:29.544
Well, maybe some
went missing.

26:29.588 --> 26:31.546
That creepy cop could've
made that happen, easy.

26:31.590 --> 26:34.767
Or weare missing something.Ah.

26:34.810 --> 26:37.030
What are you wearing?

26:37.073 --> 26:39.293
Hmm? What?What are you wearing?

26:39.336 --> 26:41.948
Oh. Bishop didn't
want it anymore.

26:41.991 --> 26:45.299
It's... so soft. [laughs]

26:45.342 --> 26:47.518
Plus, you know, I'm
a sucker for vintage T's.

26:47.562 --> 26:48.650
Okay, you know
that she once told me

26:48.694 --> 26:50.043
that was her favorite shirt?

26:50.086 --> 26:51.653
I'm telling you,
something strange is going on

26:51.697 --> 26:53.655
with this girl.TORRES:
Yeah, tell me about it.

26:53.699 --> 26:56.658
That girl is weird as hell.What's she giving away now?

26:56.702 --> 26:59.095
Oh, Bishop? No, this is not
Bishop. This is Claire's.

26:59.139 --> 27:01.707
These are the old case files
for her parents' murder.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.709
Uh, Gibbs wants us
to go through them.

27:03.752 --> 27:05.275
Whatever
Petty Officer O'Donnell found,

27:05.319 --> 27:06.973
he wants us to find it, too.

27:07.016 --> 27:09.584
[computer trills]Oh, good luck.
If you'll excuse.

27:09.628 --> 27:10.846
Mass spec calls.

27:10.890 --> 27:12.587
So, did Claire's
alibi check out?

27:12.631 --> 27:13.806
Oh, she had an alibi.

27:13.849 --> 27:15.372
Girl's got her
own hashtag.

27:15.416 --> 27:17.374
WheresClaire.

27:17.418 --> 27:20.682
Half a dozen people posted
sightings of her that night, but

27:20.726 --> 27:22.249
she was nowhere near
Noah when he was killed.

27:22.292 --> 27:23.424
KASIE:
Well, Claire may have an alibi,

27:23.467 --> 27:24.773
but the tweezers

27:24.817 --> 27:26.427
from her
storage container don't.

27:26.470 --> 27:28.821
I found traces of blood.
It's a match to Noah.

27:28.864 --> 27:30.823
These could have definitely
been used

27:30.866 --> 27:32.607
to dig out his bullets
postmortem.Well,

27:32.651 --> 27:35.262
if Claire's not our killer, how
did they end up in her workshop?

27:35.305 --> 27:37.786
#FrameClaire?Can I vote for creepy cop?

27:37.830 --> 27:40.180
Well, he did visit that property
when Noah was killed.

27:40.223 --> 27:41.964
Wait, the creepy
detective?

27:42.008 --> 27:43.705
The one sitting in our
conference room now?

27:43.749 --> 27:45.054
Wh... He's what?

27:45.098 --> 27:46.621
Yeah, he came in about
three minutes ago,

27:46.665 --> 27:48.492
demanding to speak to Gibbs.

27:52.018 --> 27:54.542
Why are you holding Claire?!Why were you

27:54.585 --> 27:56.675
at O'Donnell house
the night Noah was killed?Look,

27:56.718 --> 27:58.241
I don't answer to you.You know what?

27:58.285 --> 28:00.722
You've been lying to me
from the minute I met you.

28:00.766 --> 28:02.289
What were you doing
at that house?

28:02.332 --> 28:03.899
I was looking for Claire.

28:07.468 --> 28:10.732
You know, I barely even remember
my own wedding day.

28:10.776 --> 28:13.692
The day I met those kids--

28:13.735 --> 28:16.216
day I'll never forget.

28:19.610 --> 28:22.744
Scared out of their mind,

28:22.788 --> 28:25.747
wandering alone
out there in the...

28:25.791 --> 28:27.618
middle of that damn road.

28:27.662 --> 28:30.447
Which road?Same road where
you found Noah's body.

28:30.491 --> 28:32.754
That's where the cops
finally caught up with them.

28:32.798 --> 28:35.409
They took off running as soon as
they found their parents dead.

28:35.452 --> 28:36.715
Where have you been

28:36.758 --> 28:38.020
the last two days?

28:38.064 --> 28:41.632
I've been looking
for Noah's killer.

28:41.676 --> 28:43.417
I owed that to Claire.

28:43.460 --> 28:45.506
I failed her back then.

28:47.900 --> 28:49.466
The look on that kid's face--

28:49.510 --> 28:53.166
it's... something
I'll never forget.

28:53.209 --> 28:54.907
Look, I know
they say it's just...

28:54.950 --> 28:57.605
it's just one case, but, uh,

28:57.648 --> 29:00.390
sometimes you pin it all
on one donkey, you know?

29:00.434 --> 29:02.392
Why the games, Fischer?

29:02.436 --> 29:04.743
We're on the same team.Oh, the hell we are.

29:04.786 --> 29:06.919
The only reason I didn't
solve her parents' murder

29:06.962 --> 29:08.877
in the first place
is because of you.

29:08.921 --> 29:10.052
[laughing]:
Oh. Me?

29:10.096 --> 29:12.011
Yeah, or guys just like you.

29:12.054 --> 29:14.361
Several years after Claire's
parents were killed,

29:14.404 --> 29:16.580
I got a lead.

29:16.624 --> 29:18.278
I uncovered some new DNA.

29:18.321 --> 29:20.802
And all I needed to do
was match it

29:20.846 --> 29:23.544
against the one suspect
we had at the time.Transient

29:23.587 --> 29:25.851
in the area.
Yeah, I read the case file.The guy fit

29:25.894 --> 29:28.070
the profile--
history of mental illness,

29:28.114 --> 29:30.159
multiple arrests.

29:30.203 --> 29:32.945
He up and died.

29:32.988 --> 29:34.947
Exhume the body, pull his DNA.Yeah, well,

29:34.990 --> 29:36.252
it's not that easy
where I come from.

29:36.296 --> 29:38.124
He was buried
in a federal cemetery.

29:38.167 --> 29:41.562
And some bigwig like you
was whining about budget cuts.

29:41.605 --> 29:44.043
He didn't give a rat's ass
about some

29:44.086 --> 29:47.481
cold case in some...
small town he'd never heard of.

29:47.524 --> 29:48.787
I'm gonna solve

29:48.830 --> 29:51.354
Noah's case,
with you or without.

29:54.531 --> 29:56.882
Your... your agent said

29:56.925 --> 29:59.536
that Noah was digging
around his parents' homicide.

29:59.580 --> 30:01.190
We think he was doing more
than digging.

30:01.234 --> 30:02.975
We think he found something.

30:03.018 --> 30:05.194
Talk to Claire.

30:05.238 --> 30:06.892
Claire says she doesn't know.

30:08.981 --> 30:10.939
You know, I've been
keeping an eye on her

30:10.983 --> 30:12.854
since she was a little kid.

30:12.898 --> 30:15.074
[sighs] I'm willing to bet
she knows more than she s...

30:15.117 --> 30:17.641
she says she knows,
especially about her brother.

30:17.685 --> 30:19.121
So, you...

30:19.165 --> 30:21.907
you talk to Claire.

30:24.953 --> 30:27.434
Wow.

30:27.477 --> 30:29.915
These are so intricate.

30:29.958 --> 30:33.353
I'd never be able to do
something this delicate.

30:33.396 --> 30:35.224
I'm all thumbs.

30:35.268 --> 30:37.139
[exhales]

30:39.185 --> 30:40.969
Claire,

30:41.013 --> 30:43.972
has anyone ever talked to
you about social phobia?

30:44.016 --> 30:46.192
It's the fear

30:46.235 --> 30:48.977
of being judged
or analyzed publicly.

30:50.979 --> 30:52.807
And who could blame you, right?

30:52.851 --> 30:54.809
You're a legend, after all.

30:57.377 --> 31:01.076
Hey. I know
building these is cathartic.

31:01.120 --> 31:02.686
I get it.

31:03.731 --> 31:05.776
I know a guy who builds boats.

31:05.820 --> 31:08.083
But it's not enough.

31:09.128 --> 31:11.478
You think it will be fast?

31:11.521 --> 31:13.480
What will be fast?

31:13.523 --> 31:15.047
I don't want to wait

31:15.090 --> 31:16.048
ten years to be murdered, too.

31:16.091 --> 31:18.050
That's not gonna happen.

31:18.093 --> 31:20.748
Claire, we're putting you
in protective custody

31:20.791 --> 31:22.489
until we find your
brother's killer.

31:23.533 --> 31:24.708
Hey.

31:24.752 --> 31:26.928
Um, she hasn't slept for days.

31:26.972 --> 31:29.061
It's just setting in
that her brother

31:29.104 --> 31:31.063
is actually gone.

31:31.106 --> 31:33.804
She just needs
a little time to process.

31:33.848 --> 31:34.936
Do we have time, Jack?

31:34.980 --> 31:35.894
We've been spinning
our wheels

31:35.937 --> 31:36.938
on her parents' case.

31:36.982 --> 31:38.461
If her brother

31:38.505 --> 31:40.594
found something, we
need to know about it.

31:40.637 --> 31:43.423
Okay.
Just one bit of advice.

31:43.466 --> 31:44.946
Try to connect with her first

31:44.990 --> 31:46.730
before you, um,

31:46.774 --> 31:48.123
act like you.

31:50.430 --> 31:52.432
[whispers]:
You got it.

32:04.966 --> 32:07.926
GIBBS:
Your woodwork...

32:07.969 --> 32:09.928
is really good.

32:10.972 --> 32:12.974
Good enough to solve?

32:16.935 --> 32:19.415
GIBBS:
Murder-suicide?

32:20.416 --> 32:23.158
I heard
you can do better than that.

32:25.987 --> 32:28.468
Low-end appliances.

32:28.511 --> 32:30.165
High-end shopping bags. [woman screaming]

32:30.209 --> 32:31.601
Stack of bills [man shouting]

32:31.645 --> 32:32.994
on the kitchen table. [gunshot]

32:33.038 --> 32:36.041
Financial dispute.

32:37.868 --> 32:39.522
CLAIRE:
What else you got?

32:43.570 --> 32:45.528
Kidnapping.

32:45.572 --> 32:48.053
Entered through the window.

32:51.143 --> 32:53.101
At that height...

32:53.145 --> 32:54.885
WOMAN:
Put her down!

32:54.929 --> 32:56.452
...had to know it was unlocked.

32:56.496 --> 32:58.498
Kidnapper knew the family.

33:02.023 --> 33:03.285
GIBBS: Murder. [man screams]

33:03.329 --> 33:05.287
[fire ignites] Probably blunt force.

33:05.331 --> 33:07.028
Robbery

33:07.072 --> 33:08.160
and arson.

33:08.203 --> 33:10.031
SLOANE:
The inscription on the back

33:10.075 --> 33:11.990
reads plain, old
electrical fire.

33:12.033 --> 33:14.166
Inscription's wrong.

33:14.209 --> 33:16.298
He thought so, too.

33:16.342 --> 33:18.648
That's why Noah built it.

33:18.692 --> 33:20.868
Wait.

33:20.911 --> 33:23.044
Noah built this?

33:25.264 --> 33:27.222
Great.

33:29.094 --> 33:32.097
We've been looking
into the wrong case.

33:45.371 --> 33:46.807
BISHOP:
Okay.

33:46.850 --> 33:48.069
All right.

33:48.113 --> 33:49.592
Thanks.

33:49.636 --> 33:52.856
Okay. That was
the clerk's office.

33:52.900 --> 33:54.728
Gibbs was right.

33:54.771 --> 33:57.644
Noah was not investigating
the murder of his parents.

33:57.687 --> 34:00.647
He wanted the raw case notes
on this electrical fire.

34:00.690 --> 34:02.736
Why?McGEE:
That's a good question.

34:02.779 --> 34:04.085
Just met with
the fire inspector.

34:04.129 --> 34:06.740
He said that he traced
the source of the fire

34:06.783 --> 34:09.699
to an old fuse
and bad wiring.

34:09.743 --> 34:11.832
Even had very
convincing photos.

34:11.875 --> 34:13.312
Forget about the fire.
We're talking about

34:13.355 --> 34:14.878
what happened before the fire.

34:19.883 --> 34:21.102
Hmm.

34:21.146 --> 34:22.930
Well, looks like
the room was ransacked.

34:22.973 --> 34:24.888
BISHOP:
Victim must have
been incapacitated

34:24.932 --> 34:26.194
before the fire.TORRES:
Yeah.

34:26.238 --> 34:28.283
Someone broke in
and robbed the place.

34:28.327 --> 34:29.545
McGEE:
And killed the homeowner

34:29.589 --> 34:31.112
and started an electrical fire

34:31.156 --> 34:32.287
to cover it up.

34:32.331 --> 34:33.549
Why does it matter to Noah?

34:34.637 --> 34:36.900
What do we have on the victim?

34:37.901 --> 34:39.729
Louise Fitzgerald.

34:39.773 --> 34:41.383
63. Recently widowed.

34:41.427 --> 34:43.559
Worth millions. Neighbors
say she was quiet

34:43.603 --> 34:44.734
and kept to herself.BISHOP:
She sounds

34:44.778 --> 34:46.127
like the dream target.

34:46.171 --> 34:47.781
She have any connections
to Noah?

34:47.824 --> 34:49.174
None that I could find.

34:49.217 --> 34:51.785
Wait, did you say Louise?

34:51.828 --> 34:53.352
Fitzgerald, yeah.

34:53.395 --> 34:54.962
You know her?

34:55.005 --> 34:57.356
No.

34:57.399 --> 34:59.401
But Noah did.

35:00.663 --> 35:03.666
She was
in his martial arts class.

35:05.233 --> 35:07.931
Okay. You ever find yourself
in this position,

35:07.975 --> 35:09.019
it's real simple.

35:09.063 --> 35:10.499
You take a step

35:10.543 --> 35:12.284
behind your opponent,
and you stand up.

35:12.327 --> 35:13.415
[grunts]

35:13.459 --> 35:14.721
MAN: Oh, wow.WOMAN: Oh.

35:14.764 --> 35:16.723
All right, pair up.
Give it a try.

35:16.766 --> 35:18.899
[indistinct chatter]

35:18.942 --> 35:20.466
NCIS.

35:20.509 --> 35:22.903
I thought I'd see
you guys again.

35:22.946 --> 35:24.731
Oh, yeah?I heard you arrested
Claire O'Donnell.

35:24.774 --> 35:26.733
About time someone
got her off the streets.

35:26.776 --> 35:28.865
Glad I could help.You can help us out
with something else.

35:28.909 --> 35:31.868
We have, uh, a few questions
about a student of yours.

35:31.912 --> 35:33.914
Louise Fitzgerald.
You know her?

35:33.957 --> 35:37.874
Sure. Had a lot of spunk
for someone her age.

35:37.918 --> 35:40.138
Such a tragedy.

35:40.181 --> 35:41.748
Love my older students.

35:41.791 --> 35:44.446
Noah was pretty fond
of Louise himself.

35:44.490 --> 35:47.101
Yeah, she, uh, she sent meals
to him and Claire

35:47.145 --> 35:48.972
after what happened
to their parents.

35:49.016 --> 35:50.844
Sure does pay
to have good neighbors.Mm-hmm.

35:50.887 --> 35:52.280
How'd she die again?

35:52.324 --> 35:55.457
An electrical fire.
Yeah.

35:55.501 --> 35:56.937
Oh.

35:56.980 --> 35:59.896
Look at what your day job
just happens to be.

35:59.940 --> 36:02.072
Electrician.

36:02.116 --> 36:04.031
You see where
we're going with this?

36:10.864 --> 36:12.170
[grunting]

36:14.998 --> 36:17.000
[gun cocks]Stay down!
Don't move.

36:22.267 --> 36:24.225
What?

36:27.446 --> 36:29.274
[chuckling]

36:29.317 --> 36:31.189
That was a lucky shot, okay?

36:31.232 --> 36:32.929
Sure it was.

36:32.973 --> 36:36.019
Well, either way, your luck
has definitely run out.

36:36.063 --> 36:37.847
Well, actually,
I'd say that

36:37.891 --> 36:40.241
it ran out last year.

36:40.285 --> 36:43.418
You want to tell us about this
bankruptcy filing we found?

36:45.028 --> 36:46.595
I had a gambling problem.

36:46.639 --> 36:47.988
I lost everything.

36:48.031 --> 36:49.729
Not my finest moment.But then,

36:49.772 --> 36:51.121
a few months later...

36:51.165 --> 36:52.688
you were flush with cash.Well, that's the thing

36:52.732 --> 36:55.082
about gambling:
you just need one good bet.Or maybe

36:55.125 --> 36:57.867
one rich student
who has a very expensive

36:57.911 --> 36:59.217
jewelry collection.

37:00.479 --> 37:02.916
McGEE:
Louise Fitzgerald.
You robbed her

37:02.959 --> 37:04.570
and you murdered her.
Started an electrical fire

37:04.613 --> 37:06.702
to cover your tracks.

37:06.746 --> 37:08.574
Now, most people
didn't bat an eye.

37:08.617 --> 37:09.966
Except Noah wasn't most people.

37:10.010 --> 37:11.968
He started making nutshells
with his sister.

37:12.012 --> 37:13.187
He knew Louise,

37:13.231 --> 37:14.580
decided he'd start
with her case,

37:14.623 --> 37:16.103
but some things didn't add up.

37:16.146 --> 37:17.409
He asked his electrician buddy

37:17.452 --> 37:19.237
how to stage an electrical fire.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.239
But then
his buddy...

37:21.282 --> 37:23.110
panicked.So his buddy

37:23.153 --> 37:24.981
killed Noah, staged it

37:25.025 --> 37:27.245
to look like his parents'
killers were still around.

37:27.288 --> 37:29.334
Mm. That's as much
as an urban legend

37:29.377 --> 37:32.032
as it gets.

37:32.075 --> 37:33.816
Look a little pale, there...

37:33.860 --> 37:35.905
buddy.

37:41.824 --> 37:42.912
Thank you.

37:42.956 --> 37:44.653
For everything.

37:44.697 --> 37:46.525
Thank you,Claire.

37:46.568 --> 37:48.178
You and your brother
helped solve a case

37:48.222 --> 37:50.572
that no one
even knew existed.

37:50.616 --> 37:53.053
I don't know
what I'm gonna do without him.

37:53.096 --> 37:55.969
Ah. You can start
by calling this number.

37:56.012 --> 37:58.058
She's expecting your call.

37:58.101 --> 37:59.233
She can help.

37:59.277 --> 38:00.843
Yeah.
And then you can call me.

38:00.887 --> 38:02.018
You have
a real eye

38:02.062 --> 38:03.585
for forensics.
We should talk.

38:03.629 --> 38:05.935
I think I'm done
with the nutshells.

38:05.979 --> 38:08.155
Though someone did offer me
ten grand last month

38:08.198 --> 38:09.939
to build their daughter
a dollhouse.

38:09.983 --> 38:11.332
Ten grand?[chuckles]

38:11.376 --> 38:12.768
Maybe I'm in the wrong business.

38:12.812 --> 38:14.901
Oh, come now, Kasie,
it's never too late

38:14.944 --> 38:17.295
to start riding a new pony.

38:18.513 --> 38:22.125
You know,
these are extraordinary.

38:22.169 --> 38:23.649
But, uh...

38:23.692 --> 38:25.346
well, that's not why I'm here.

38:25.390 --> 38:29.350
I took the liberty
of calling in a favor.

38:29.394 --> 38:31.047
Detective Fischer

38:31.091 --> 38:34.573
now has approval to exhume
the one remaining suspect

38:34.616 --> 38:36.488
in your parents' murder.

38:36.531 --> 38:37.924
SLOANE:
He never gave up on

38:37.967 --> 38:39.882
your parents' case, Claire.He-He's on the way

38:39.926 --> 38:41.797
to the cemetery
as we speak.

38:41.841 --> 38:44.104
Course, we can't be sure
as to the outcome,

38:44.147 --> 38:45.671
what it will produce.

38:45.714 --> 38:48.717
Hopefully, it'll be the same
justice

38:48.761 --> 38:51.546
that you helped
deliver for Noah.

38:52.982 --> 38:54.593
Thank you.

38:58.336 --> 38:59.728
Oh, hold up.

39:06.474 --> 39:10.086
I, uh, I heard Claire and that
detective are having lunch.

39:12.437 --> 39:14.047
Mm-hmm.

39:18.356 --> 39:20.880
Uh, aren't you gonna ask me
about my donation, too?

39:24.318 --> 39:27.756
They are just things
that I don't need anymore.

39:29.018 --> 39:31.064
People evolve.

39:31.107 --> 39:32.587
And...

39:32.631 --> 39:35.460
I'm not the same person
I was when I first started.

39:37.200 --> 39:38.376
Bishop...

39:42.467 --> 39:44.469
...you got to evolve.

39:47.385 --> 39:49.909
You can't erase it all.

39:52.477 --> 39:54.435
Hang on to this.
