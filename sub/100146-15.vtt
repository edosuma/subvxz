WEBVTT

00:13.240 --> 00:15.180
ALL RIGHT, Y'ALL.
ROUND UP.

00:15.180 --> 00:18.250
ROUND UP
RIGHT QUICK.

00:18.250 --> 00:22.790
OK. I'M REALLY
PROUD OF Y'ALL.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.250
IF Y'ALL PLAY
THIS WEEKEND

00:24.250 --> 00:25.790
THE WAY YOU'VE
BEEN PRACTICING,

00:25.790 --> 00:27.320
I HAVE NO DOUBT
WE'RE GONNA WIN

00:27.320 --> 00:29.790
THIS JAMBOREE AND BRING HOME
ANOTHER CHAMPIONSHIP.

00:29.790 --> 00:30.790
THAT'S RIGHT.
YES, SIR.

00:30.790 --> 00:32.260
YES, SIR.
ALL RIGHT.

00:32.260 --> 00:35.330
UNFORTUNATELY, YOU'LL
HAVE TO DO THAT WITHOUT ME.

00:35.330 --> 00:38.100
UH, YEAH, WITHOUT ME,
TOO, DAD, BUT--

00:38.100 --> 00:40.070
NO. I'M ACTUALLY
SERIOUS, SON.

00:40.070 --> 00:42.970
I HAVE BEEN
SUSPENDED.

00:42.970 --> 00:45.840
IT'S TEMPORARY, BUT
UNTIL THINGS GET RESOLVED,

00:45.840 --> 00:47.380
YOU'RE GONNA BE IN
REALLY GOOD HANDS

00:47.380 --> 00:49.680
HERE WITH
COACH DAVIS.

00:50.710 --> 00:51.950
WHAT HAPPENED?

00:51.950 --> 00:53.350
THERE'S BEEN
A PERSONAL MATTER

00:53.350 --> 00:54.720
BETWEEN ME AND
THE ADMINISTRATION,

00:54.720 --> 00:56.290
BUT I NEED YOU
TO STAY FOCUSED,

00:56.290 --> 00:57.950
SO GET YOUR BEHINDS
OUT THERE ON THAT FIELD.

00:57.950 --> 01:00.220
IT'S YOUR LAST PRACTICE.
MAKE IT COUNT.

01:00.220 --> 01:02.120
COME ON. HEADS UP.

01:05.360 --> 01:07.400
YO, LAST TIME WE PLAYED
WITHOUT COACH BAKER,

01:07.400 --> 01:09.630
WE GOT OUR ASSES
HANDED TO US.

01:09.630 --> 01:11.830
Y'ALL MIGHT HAVE TO
PLAY WITHOUT ME, TOO.

01:11.830 --> 01:14.100
HE STILL DIDN'T CLEAR ME
SINCE MY ARM WENT OUT.

01:14.100 --> 01:16.710
YOU HEARD THE MAN.
LET'S GO.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.650
YOU SHOULD BE OUT
ON THE FIELD.

01:27.650 --> 01:29.390
NO. YOU SHOULD.

01:29.390 --> 01:30.850
COACH, LIV TOLD ME
WHAT YOU DID.

01:30.850 --> 01:32.250
I CAN'T LET YOU
TAKE THE BLAME.

01:32.250 --> 01:33.290
I'M GONNA TELL
PRINCIPAL LONDON

01:33.290 --> 01:34.720
THE STEROIDS
WERE MINE.

01:34.720 --> 01:36.390
NO, YOU WILL NOT.
LOOK.

01:36.390 --> 01:38.890
I MADE A DECISION, AND I
EXPECT YOU TO RESPECT IT.

01:38.890 --> 01:41.930
YOU DON'T DESERVE TO HAVE
YOUR FUTURE RUINED BY THIS.

01:41.930 --> 01:43.300
AND YOU DO?

01:43.300 --> 01:45.670
I'LL JUST GET
A SLAP ON THE WRIST.

01:45.670 --> 01:48.200
I'LL BE BACK
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT.

01:48.200 --> 01:51.810
I'M SO SORRY, COACH.
I NEVER MEANT FOR--

01:51.810 --> 01:53.880
I JUST WANTED
TO BE BETTER.

01:53.880 --> 01:56.310
I KNOW. I WANT
THAT FOR YOU, TOO,

01:56.310 --> 01:59.150
TO BE BETTER BY
GETTING YOUR MIND

01:59.150 --> 02:00.920
AND YOUR BODY
RIGHT AGAIN.

02:00.920 --> 02:02.280
I'M TRYING, SIR.

02:02.280 --> 02:04.050
IT TOOK ME ALMOST
LOSING OLIVIA TO REALIZE

02:04.050 --> 02:06.360
HOW MUCH PRESSURE Y'ALL
PUT YOURSELVES UNDER,

02:06.360 --> 02:08.960
AND I KNOW RECOVERY
IS HARD WORK,

02:08.960 --> 02:11.930
SO JUST PROMISE ME
YOU'LL KEEP IT UP.

02:11.930 --> 02:14.330
MAKE THIS SUSPENSION
WORTH IT.

02:14.330 --> 02:16.100
YES, SIR.

02:16.100 --> 02:19.240
NICK JORDAN: ♪ NA NA NA NA
NA NA NA NA NA ♪

02:19.240 --> 02:22.040

02:22.040 --> 02:25.310

02:26.910 --> 02:30.050
COACH WILSON,
HEY.

02:30.050 --> 02:31.780
YOUR MOM SAID
YOU'D BE HERE.

02:31.780 --> 02:32.950
HOW'S THE SHOULDER?
GOOD.

02:32.950 --> 02:34.720
SHOULDER'S GOOD,
GREAT, ACTUALLY.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.190
YOU EXCITED FOR
THE JAMBOREE?

02:36.190 --> 02:38.820
OH, YEAH. WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE COACH?

02:38.820 --> 02:40.320
NO DISRESPECT,
I JUST THOUGHT

02:40.320 --> 02:42.220
MY SCHOLARSHIP
WAS OFF THE TABLE.

02:42.220 --> 02:44.060
NOTHING'S SET
IN STONE, SPENCER.

02:44.060 --> 02:45.960
I'M HERE OFF THE RECORD
BECAUSE I LIKE YOU,

02:45.960 --> 02:47.460
AND I STILL LIKE YOU
FOR OUR PROGRAM.

02:47.460 --> 02:48.930
BUT COACH KELLY
DOESN'T AGREE.

02:48.930 --> 02:50.070
I WOULDN'T SAY THAT.

02:50.070 --> 02:51.330
HE DOES HAVE
SOME CONCERNS,

02:51.330 --> 02:53.340
SO HE'S EYEING
A FEW OTHER RECRUITS.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.870
I CONVINCED HIM
TO HOLD OFF FOR NOW,

02:54.870 --> 02:56.810
BUT I NEED TO KNOW
YOU'RE BACK ON TRACK.

02:56.810 --> 02:58.070
AND WHAT DO I GOT
TO DO TO PROVE IT?

02:58.070 --> 02:59.340
GO OUT THERE THIS
WEEKEND AND SHOW ME

02:59.340 --> 03:01.280
THE OLD SPENCER JAMES
IS BACK.

03:01.280 --> 03:02.950
CAN YOU DO THAT
FOR ME?

03:02.950 --> 03:04.750
NO DOUBT.

03:04.750 --> 03:06.480
AFTER YOU SEE ME BALL,
THERE WON'T BE NO QUESTION,

03:06.480 --> 03:09.490
NOT FROM YOU, COACH KELLY,
OR ANYBODY ELSE.

03:09.490 --> 03:10.950
I PROMISE YOU THAT.

03:10.950 --> 03:12.220
IT'S ALL
I NEEDED TO HEAR.

03:12.220 --> 03:13.360
ALL RIGHT.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.530
IF I CAN'T PLAY
THIS WEEKEND,

03:25.530 --> 03:28.170
IT'S NOT GONNA MATTER IF
I'M IN GAME SHAPE OR NOT.

03:28.170 --> 03:30.040
ALL THE DOWNWARD DOG'S
GONNA BE FOR NOTHING.

03:30.040 --> 03:31.370
OLIVIA: OH,
NOT FOR NOTHING.

03:31.370 --> 03:32.980
I MEAN, YOGA'S
GOOD FOR YOU, ANYWAY.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.540
IT HELPS WITH STRENGTH,
FLEXIBILITY,

03:34.540 --> 03:36.980
BALANCE,
EVEN STRESS.

03:36.980 --> 03:39.280
AND THE GOATS?

03:39.280 --> 03:42.050
LAYLA: WELL, THEY HELP
YOUR HEART BY BEING CUTE.

03:42.050 --> 03:43.290
HMM.

03:43.290 --> 03:45.120
OLIVIA: THE GOATS
WEREN'T MY IDEA.

03:45.120 --> 03:47.260
I THOUGHT "GOAT" STOOD FOR
"GREATEST OF ALL TIME."

03:47.260 --> 03:48.890
SOMETIMES IT'S
JUST GOAT, MAN.

03:48.890 --> 03:51.460
J.J.: I'M SORRY, OK?
THIS WEEK SUCKS.

03:51.460 --> 03:53.530
GOATS ARE PEEING
EVERYWHERE,

03:53.530 --> 03:55.800
COACH IS SUSPENDED,
SPENCE MIGHT NOT PLAY,

03:55.800 --> 03:57.270
AND THE VENUE FOR
THE JAMBOREE PARTY

03:57.270 --> 03:58.400
FELL THROUGH.
WAIT.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.140
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE VENUE?

04:00.140 --> 04:02.200
SOMEONE FORGET TO SEND
THE DEPOSIT ON TIME.

04:02.200 --> 04:05.010
IT'S NOT
IMPORTANT WHO.

04:05.010 --> 04:08.140
I EVEN HAD THE
PERFECT THEME--

04:08.140 --> 04:10.580
PAJAMA JAMMY
JAMBOREE.

04:10.580 --> 04:12.580
LAYLA: WELL, CAN'T
LET THAT GO TO WASTE.

04:12.580 --> 04:15.580
WHY DON'T WE HAVE
THE PARTY AT MY HOUSE?

04:15.580 --> 04:18.590
MAYBE THAT'S NOT
THE BEST IDEA.

04:18.590 --> 04:20.560
SPENCER: YEAH. IT AIN'T
JUST FOR BEVERLY.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.290
IT'S FOR ALL THE TEAMS
IN THE JAMBOREE.

04:22.290 --> 04:24.930
WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING
I HAVE A BIG HOUSE, THEN.

04:24.930 --> 04:26.500
PARTIES WEREN'T
MY PROBLEM.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.900
IT WAS THE PARTY CRASHER
IN MY HEAD,

04:28.900 --> 04:30.470
AND SHE'S BEEN
QUIET LATELY.

04:30.470 --> 04:34.070
IT'LL BE FINE,
I PROMISE.

04:34.070 --> 04:35.940
WHERE IS JORDAN?

04:35.940 --> 04:37.570
WHY ISN'T HE SUFFERING
THROUGH THIS?

04:37.570 --> 04:39.580
HE STAYED BACK TO
TALK TO HIS DAD.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.340
PROBABLY ABOUT
THE SUSPENSION.

04:41.340 --> 04:43.250
YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT IT?

04:43.250 --> 04:46.250
NO. I HAVEN'T
HEARD ANYTHING.

05:02.930 --> 05:04.330
FOR MY LAST BITE.

05:04.330 --> 05:06.270
HEY, LOOK.
I'MA JUST SAY IT.

05:06.270 --> 05:08.240
I CAN'T DO THIS
NO MORE.

05:08.240 --> 05:10.540
IT'S TOO HARD TRYING
TO BE YOUR DAMN FRIEND.

05:10.540 --> 05:13.340
YOU DITCHED A GUN FOR ME.
WE LOVE EACH OTHER.

05:13.340 --> 05:15.940
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY
WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.480
I MISS YOU, BABE.

05:17.480 --> 05:19.650
I MISS YOU, TOO, BUT WE
ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THIS.

05:19.650 --> 05:21.480
I'M LEAVING SOON
FOR J.P.'s SUMMER TOUR,

05:21.480 --> 05:24.120
AND, YOU KNOW, THINGS
WEREN'T EXACTLY SMOOTH

05:24.120 --> 05:25.950
BETWEEN US LAST TIME
HE WAS INVOLVED.

05:25.950 --> 05:27.890
NO. IT AIN'T GOING DOWN
LIKE THAT AGAIN,

05:27.890 --> 05:29.990
ALL RIGHT, NO MORE
JEALOUS COOP.

05:29.990 --> 05:31.990
I'M GONNA BE
YOUR BIGGEST FAN.

05:31.990 --> 05:34.160
YOU'RE GONNA BE CALLING ME
YOUR COOPY GROUPIE.

05:34.160 --> 05:37.230
HA HA! YEAH. I'M NEVER
CALLING YOU THAT.

05:37.230 --> 05:39.100
LISTEN, BABY.

05:39.100 --> 05:41.100
WOULDN'T NOTHING
MAKE ME HAPPIER

05:41.100 --> 05:43.410
THAN SEEING YOU
BLOW UP.

05:43.410 --> 05:46.540
MAYBE ONE THING--

05:48.040 --> 05:50.010
SEEING YOU BLOW UP
WITH THIS.

05:54.380 --> 05:56.390
YOU WROTE
A SONG FOR ME?

05:56.390 --> 05:57.650
I AIN'T NEVER
LETTING MUSIC

05:57.650 --> 05:59.690
COME IN BETWEEN
US AGAIN, OK?

05:59.690 --> 06:01.520
IT'S ONLY GONNA
MAKE US CLOSER.

06:01.520 --> 06:03.190
GOD, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

06:03.190 --> 06:04.560
I DO BECAUSE I WASN'T
GONNA GIVE IT TO YOU

06:04.560 --> 06:06.260
UNTIL YOU SAID YOU'D
BE MY GIRL AGAIN,

06:06.260 --> 06:09.930
BUT YOU'RE TAKING WAY
TOO LONG TO ANSWER.

06:12.600 --> 06:13.870
HMM.

06:16.540 --> 06:18.410
YOUR LAST
PERFECT PIECE?

06:18.410 --> 06:20.010
MY LAST
PERFECT PIECE.

06:20.010 --> 06:21.580
OH, I GUESS I GOT
MY ANSWER, THEN.

06:21.580 --> 06:23.750
HA HA!

06:27.620 --> 06:29.150
WOW, UP CULVER
STAIRS AGAIN?

06:29.150 --> 06:31.150
DON'T OVERDO IT,
YOUNGBLOOD.

06:31.150 --> 06:32.960
THEM STEPS AIN'T
GOING NOWHERE,

06:32.960 --> 06:34.960
EXCEPT UP AND DOWN,
I GUESS.

06:34.960 --> 06:39.030
HA HA HA!
THAT'S FUNNY.

06:39.030 --> 06:40.600
HOW YOU MAKING JOKES
WHEN YOUR WHOLE CAREER'S

06:40.600 --> 06:42.230
UP IN THE AIR, MAN?

06:42.230 --> 06:44.170
OH, AIN'T NOTHING
UP IN THE AIR,

06:44.170 --> 06:46.440
AND THAT'S ALL I'M GONNA
SAY ABOUT THE SUSPENSION.

06:46.440 --> 06:50.170
ALL RIGHT. WHAT ABOUT
MY SUSPENSION?

06:50.170 --> 06:51.640
WHEN YOU GONNA
CLEAR ME TO PLAY?

06:51.640 --> 06:53.310
LOOK. I REHABBED
THE WAY YOU TOLD ME TO.

06:53.310 --> 06:55.240
MY SHOULDER FEELS GREAT.
I'M READY TO SUIT UP.

06:55.240 --> 06:56.710
I DON'T THINK SO.

06:56.710 --> 06:58.180
BESIDES, IT'S NOT
MY CALL, ANYWAY.

06:58.180 --> 06:59.380
MAYBE TECHNICALLY,

06:59.380 --> 07:00.380
BUT YOU CAN TALK
TO COACH DAVIS.

07:00.380 --> 07:01.720
HE'D LISTEN TO YOU.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.190
IT'S TOO RISKY.
JUST HEAL UP.

07:03.190 --> 07:04.590
COME BACK STRONG
NEXT SEASON.

07:04.590 --> 07:06.120
I AIN'T GOT THAT KIND
OF TIME, COACH. LOOK.

07:06.120 --> 07:08.120
UCLA's GIVING ME ONE
MORE SHOT, ALL RIGHT?

07:08.120 --> 07:09.460
I'M GONNA LOSE IT
IF I DON'T PLAY.

07:09.460 --> 07:11.190
LOOK. IF UCLA
REALLY WANTS YOU,

07:11.190 --> 07:12.660
THEN THEY'LL WAIT,
BUT THEY DEFINITELY

07:12.660 --> 07:14.200
WON'T WANT YOU IF YOU
REINJURE YOURSELF

07:14.200 --> 07:15.330
TRYING TO COME BACK
TOO SOON.

07:15.330 --> 07:16.470
WE'VE HAD
THIS DISCUSSION.

07:16.470 --> 07:17.600
THAT WAS BEFORE
COACH WILSON

07:17.600 --> 07:19.070
CAME BACK AROUND,
ALL RIGHT?

07:19.070 --> 07:21.070
I TOLD HIM I'M PLAYING
THIS WEEKEND.

07:21.070 --> 07:22.770
SHOULDN'T HAVE
DONE THAT.

07:22.770 --> 07:24.340
COME ON, COACH.

07:24.340 --> 07:26.070
MY NATIONAL RANKING
TOOK A HUGE HIT.

07:26.070 --> 07:27.680
YOU KNOW THAT.

07:27.680 --> 07:29.610
IF I DON'T PLAY, AIN'T NOBODY
CHECKING FOR ME NEXT SEASON.

07:29.610 --> 07:31.480
I'M SORRY, SPENCER.
I CAN'T DO IT.

07:31.480 --> 07:33.120
YOU WANTED ME
TO COME TO BEVERLY

07:33.120 --> 07:35.080
SO I COULD HAVE A SHOT
AT SOMEWHERE LIKE UCLA,

07:35.080 --> 07:36.520
AND NOW I GOT IT,
YOU THE ONLY ONE

07:36.520 --> 07:39.020
STANDING IN MY WAY.

07:54.240 --> 07:56.940
HEY.
OH. UH, HEY.

07:56.940 --> 08:00.810
SO LISTEN. UH--

08:00.810 --> 08:03.340
HEY, SO I TEXTED YOU
A FEW TIMES

08:03.340 --> 08:05.280
BUT DIDN'T HEAR
ANYTHING BACK,

08:05.280 --> 08:08.020
NOT EVEN A
"NEW PHONE. WHO THIS?"

08:09.250 --> 08:10.890
HOW ARE YOU?

08:10.890 --> 08:12.290
EVERYTHING OK
WITH DANE?

08:12.290 --> 08:14.820
HOW'S THE BABY,
KICKING A LOT?

08:14.820 --> 08:16.890
THE BABY, I MEAN,
SIMONE, NOT DANE.

08:16.890 --> 08:20.400
JORDAN, EVERYTHING'S
FINE, OK?

08:20.400 --> 08:23.100
THANKS, BUT
I GOT TO GO.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.540
WELL, THAT
WAS AWKWARD.

08:31.540 --> 08:33.510
YEAH. I DON'T
GET WOMEN.

08:33.510 --> 08:35.110
WELL, THAT'S BECAUSE
YOU ONLY DATE GIRLS, SO--

08:35.110 --> 08:36.910
MM. EVER SINCE
SHE MOVED OUT,

08:36.910 --> 08:38.450
SHE--I DON'T KNOW--
HAS GONE

08:38.450 --> 08:40.320
OUT OF HER WAY
TO AVOID ME.

08:40.320 --> 08:42.250
I'D LEAVE IT ALONE
IF I WERE YOU.

08:42.250 --> 08:43.850
LITTLE MISS "ALL UP IN
EVERYONE'S BUSINESS,"

08:43.850 --> 08:45.150
ARE YOU SURE
ABOUT THAT?

08:45.150 --> 08:47.990
WHICH IS WHY I KNOW
IT'LL BACKFIRE.

08:47.990 --> 08:49.560
IF SHE WANTED YOU
TO KNOW SOMETHING,

08:49.560 --> 08:51.390
SHE WOULD TELL YOU.
OK.

08:51.390 --> 08:53.560
YEAH, BUT WHY IS EVERYONE
KEEPING THINGS FROM ME?

08:53.560 --> 08:55.430
DAD WON'T TELL ME ANYTHING
ABOUT HIS SUSPENSION.

08:55.430 --> 08:57.800
HAS HE SAID
ANYTHING TO YOU?

08:57.800 --> 09:01.000
LOOK. DON'T WORRY
ABOUT SIMONE, OK?

09:01.000 --> 09:03.000
I'M SURE IT'S
NOTHING PERSONAL.

09:03.000 --> 09:07.280
JUST GIVE HER SOME SPACE
AND STOP FOLLOWING HER.

09:07.280 --> 09:10.310
I MEAN, YOU DON'T
WANT TO SEEM CRAZY.

09:18.590 --> 09:21.460
WELL, I DIDN'T KNOW DANE'S
PARENTS LIVED IN A HOTEL.

09:21.460 --> 09:23.060
WHAT, ARE YOU
STALKING ME NOW?

09:23.060 --> 09:24.430
I WAS JUST WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

09:24.430 --> 09:26.160
DID YOU ACTUALLY
REACH OUT TO DANE,

09:26.160 --> 09:28.100
OR WAS THAT JUST
ANOTHER LIE?

09:28.100 --> 09:30.160
YES, JORDAN.

09:30.160 --> 09:33.170
I REACHED OUT TO HIM,
AND NOTHING'S CHANGED.

09:33.170 --> 09:35.370
HE SAID THE BABY ISN'T HIS,
AND HE WON'T HELP ME.

09:35.370 --> 09:38.510
OK, SO WHY
DID YOU MOVE OUT?

09:38.510 --> 09:42.240
BECAUSE I DIDN'T WANT TO
GIVE YOU THE WRONG IDEA.

09:42.240 --> 09:44.050
SIMONE, YOU WEREN'T
GIVING ME ANY IDEAS.

09:44.050 --> 09:46.080
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO BE YOUR FRIEND.

09:46.080 --> 09:48.220
WE WERE NEVER REALLY
FRIENDS, JORDAN.

09:48.220 --> 09:50.250
LOOK. I'M NOT YOUR
PROBLEM ANYMORE,

09:50.250 --> 09:54.460
SO JUST GO LIVE
YOUR LIFE, PLEASE.

10:05.500 --> 10:08.340
HEY.
HI.

10:13.210 --> 10:15.610
THANK YOU
FOR COMING.

10:15.610 --> 10:18.880
I KNOW I'VE PUT YOU
THROUGH A LOT LATELY.

10:18.880 --> 10:23.350
YEAH? WELL, EVERYONE
MAKES MISTAKES.

10:23.350 --> 10:25.890
IT'S WHAT WE DO AFTER
THAT MATTERS.

10:25.890 --> 10:27.420
I REALLY HOPE
THAT'S TRUE

10:27.420 --> 10:30.020
BECAUSE I WANT
TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.630
I HAD THIS MADE
TO REPLACE THE ONE

10:31.630 --> 10:34.500
THAT GOT SHATTERED THE
NIGHT SPENCER GOT SHOT.

10:36.030 --> 10:39.300
I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT
IT WAS TO YOU.

10:39.300 --> 10:41.900
THANK YOU.

10:41.900 --> 10:43.970
YOU DIDN'T
HAVE TO DO THAT.

10:43.970 --> 10:47.110
NO. I DID.
I SHOULD'VE BEEN THERE.

10:47.110 --> 10:48.580
I'M SORRY ABOUT
YOUR DAD, TOO.

10:48.580 --> 10:50.510
I WANTED TO COME CLEAN.
HE WOULDN'T LET ME, SO--

10:50.510 --> 10:53.010
I'M NOT MAD AT YOU.

10:53.010 --> 10:55.980
I GET WHY YOU AND MY DAD
DID WHAT YOU DID.

10:55.980 --> 10:58.120
I'M MORE UPSET
WITH MYSELF

10:58.120 --> 11:00.020
BECAUSE IF I HADN'T TOLD
MY DAD ABOUT THE STEROIDS,

11:00.020 --> 11:01.660
HE WOULDN'T EVEN BE
IN THIS SITUATION.

11:01.660 --> 11:03.320
NONE OF THIS
IS YOUR FAULT, LIV.

11:03.320 --> 11:04.690
THEN WHY DOES IT
FEEL THAT WAY?

11:04.690 --> 11:06.290
BECAUSE YOU'RE
A GOOD PERSON.

11:06.290 --> 11:10.300
I'M LYING TO SPENCER.
I'M LYING TO JORDAN.

11:10.300 --> 11:13.070
KEEPING EVERYTHING INSIDE
JUST MAKES ME FEEL

11:13.070 --> 11:14.570
LIKE I'M GONNA
EXPLODE.

11:14.570 --> 11:16.300
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO LIE FOR ME.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.670
LIV, I WILL TELL THEM.
I'LL TELL THEM--

11:17.670 --> 11:20.140
WHY DOES THIS KEEP
HAPPENING TO US?

11:20.140 --> 11:21.680
WE'VE ONLY BEEN
DATING A FEW MONTHS.

11:21.680 --> 11:25.450
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE
OUR HONEYMOON PHASE.

11:29.550 --> 11:32.420
I THINK WE
NEED A BREAK.

11:32.420 --> 11:35.190
I NEED TO BE
WITH MY FAMILY,

11:35.190 --> 11:40.430
AND YOU SHOULD FOCUS
ON YOU AND YOUR FUTURE,

11:40.430 --> 11:43.970
GET BACK TO THE GUY YOU
WERE BEFORE STEROIDS.

11:59.050 --> 12:01.080
HEY, THOSE GO OUT
BY THE STAGE.

12:01.080 --> 12:02.120
YOU GOT IT.

12:05.450 --> 12:07.660
HEY, DAD.
"HEY, DAD"?

12:07.660 --> 12:09.120
YOU WANT TO TELL ME
WHY THERE ARE

12:09.120 --> 12:10.660
SO MANY TRUCKS
IN MY DRIVEWAY

12:10.660 --> 12:12.190
AND SO MANY PEOPLE
IN MY HOUSE?

12:12.190 --> 12:15.000
WELL, IT'S FOR
THE PARTY TONIGHT.

12:15.000 --> 12:17.630
UM, SORRY.
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU.

12:17.630 --> 12:21.340
YOU MEAN, YOU
FORGOT TO ASK ME.

12:21.340 --> 12:23.070
YEAH. SORRY.

12:23.070 --> 12:25.210
I'M NOT USED TO HAVING
TO ASK FOR PERMISSION.

12:25.210 --> 12:28.210
YOU HAVING PARTIES
EVERY TIME I LEFT TOWN?

12:28.210 --> 12:30.750
WELL, NOT EVERY TIME.
OK.

12:30.750 --> 12:34.750
THIS FATHER-DAUGHTER
DYNAMIC, IT'S NEW.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.750
WE OBVIOUSLY NEED
TO WORK ON IT,

12:36.750 --> 12:38.420
SET SOME BOUNDARIES.
WAIT.

12:38.420 --> 12:41.790
DOES THIS MEAN I
CAN'T HAVE THE PARTY?

12:41.790 --> 12:44.360
OH, GOD...

12:44.360 --> 12:46.260
OK. YOU CAN
HAVE THE PARTY,

12:46.260 --> 12:49.300
BUT I'M GONNA STICK
AROUND TO SUPERVISE.

12:49.300 --> 12:53.100
GREAT.
THAT'LL BE FUN.

12:53.100 --> 12:55.100
I'M NOT GONNA HAVE NO FUN
AT THIS PARTY, MAN.

12:55.100 --> 12:56.770
I'M NOT EVEN PLAYING
IN THE JAMBOREE.

12:56.770 --> 12:58.710
I'M NOT, EITHER,
BUT I AIN'T MISSING

12:58.710 --> 13:00.710
PRETTY CHICKS IN PJs.

13:00.710 --> 13:02.440
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

13:02.440 --> 13:04.450
OH, THE NEWS HASN'T
MADE IT TO BEVERLY YET.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.310
SOUTH CRENSHAW
DROPPED OUT.

13:06.310 --> 13:08.120
OF THE JAMBOREE?

13:08.120 --> 13:09.720
THAT DON'T MAKE NO SENSE.
WHY WOULD Y'ALL DO THAT?

13:09.720 --> 13:12.290
TEAM'S BEEN FALLING APART
FOR A WHILE NOW, SPENCE.

13:12.290 --> 13:15.520
WE'VE LOST TWO HEAD COACHES
IN LESS THAN 6 MONTHS.

13:15.520 --> 13:18.160
ALMOST EVERYBODY'S QUIT
TO PLAY OTHER SPORTS.

13:18.160 --> 13:19.590
CAM'S EVEN LOOKING
TO TRANSFER

13:19.590 --> 13:21.200
TO PLAY
FOR WESTLAKE.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.530
DAMN. I MEAN, LOOK.
IT'S ONLY THE JAMBOREE.

13:23.530 --> 13:25.270
Y'ALL'LL BE GOOD
BY NEXT SEASON.

13:25.270 --> 13:28.140
I MEAN, THEY BETTER.
I CAME HERE TO PLAY BALL.

13:28.140 --> 13:30.300
IF THEY DON'T
PULL IT TOGETHER,

13:30.300 --> 13:31.810
YEAH, OUR PROGRAM
GOES TO HELL,

13:31.810 --> 13:33.670
TAKING MY UCLA
COMMITMENT WITH IT.

13:33.670 --> 13:35.480
MAN, I HOPE NOT.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.550
BE NICE IF AT LEAST
ONE OF US WAS A BRUIN.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.810

GIVING UP SO EASY?

13:39.810 --> 13:41.420

13:41.420 --> 13:43.450

13:43.450 --> 13:44.690
IT WOULDN'T FEEL
RIGHT GOING OVER

13:44.690 --> 13:46.490
COACH BAKER'S HEAD
LIKE THAT, MAN.

13:46.490 --> 13:49.090
OH, IF IT WAS ME, NOTHING
WOULD STAND IN MY WAY.

13:49.090 --> 13:52.490

18:12.220 --> 18:14.420
I WANT TO
SIGN YOU, COOP.

18:14.420 --> 18:17.890
IT'S NOT TOO LATE TO ADD
YOU TO MY TOUR THIS SUMMER.

18:17.890 --> 18:20.430
YOU KNOW THAT WAS A KID 'N PLAY
SONG BACK THERE, RIGHT?

18:20.430 --> 18:23.400
IT WASN'T THE SONG
THAT CONVINCED ME.

18:23.400 --> 18:28.170
IT WAS YOU, SO...
WE DOING THIS?

18:33.240 --> 18:35.510
CAN I THINK
ABOUT IT?

18:35.510 --> 18:37.140
I DON'T REMEMBER
THE LAST TIME SOMEONE

18:37.140 --> 18:38.840
HAD TO THINK
ABOUT SIGNING WITH ME.

18:38.840 --> 18:41.250
IT'S KIND OF A LOT
TO TAKE IN, DAD.

18:41.250 --> 18:44.380
NO. IT'S FINE. IT'S FINE,
BUT DON'T TAKE TOO LONG.

18:44.380 --> 18:47.050
YOU'LL HURT MY FEELINGS.

18:47.050 --> 18:50.920
YOU GIRLS
SHOULD BE PROUD.

18:52.120 --> 18:53.560
MAN: WHOO!

18:53.560 --> 18:55.190
HELLER: ♪ SLIP, SLIDE,
LOW GLIDE ♪

18:55.190 --> 18:57.000
♪ DON'T KNOW THE WORDS?
JUST... ♪

18:57.000 --> 18:59.300
ISN'T COOP SIGNING WITH
YOUR DAD A GOOD THING?

18:59.300 --> 19:02.170
YEAH. IT IS,
DEFINITELY.

19:02.170 --> 19:05.300
UH-OH.
3 YESES MEANS NO.

19:05.300 --> 19:08.810
NO. IT IS.
I'M JUST NERVOUS.

19:08.810 --> 19:11.210
I WENT FROM ALL ALONE
WITH NOTHING TO DO

19:11.210 --> 19:12.950
TO MY DAD COMING BACK

19:12.950 --> 19:15.210
AND WORKING ON
MUSIC WITH COOP.

19:15.210 --> 19:18.080
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN BOTH
OF THOSE THINGS ARE GONE?

19:18.080 --> 19:20.020
I MEAN, HAVE YOU TALKED
TO THEM ABOUT IT?

19:20.020 --> 19:22.890
NO. I WOULD NEVER GET IN
THE WAY OF COOP'S SUCCESS.

19:22.890 --> 19:26.930
BESIDES, I FEEL GUILTY
THAT IT EVEN BOTHERS ME.

19:26.930 --> 19:28.290
I DON'T KNOW.

19:28.290 --> 19:29.930
MAYBE IT'S BETTER FOR
EVERYONE IF I JUST

19:29.930 --> 19:31.900
GO BACK TO PRETENDING
LIKE EVERYTHING'S FINE.

19:31.900 --> 19:33.470
WHAT? NO. NO WAY.

19:33.470 --> 19:36.070
I WON'T LET YOU AFTER
YOU'VE COME THIS FAR.

19:36.070 --> 19:39.310
BESIDES, THERE'S ENOUGH
PEOPLE LYING ALREADY.

19:39.310 --> 19:42.310
WHAT HAPPENED?

19:42.310 --> 19:44.040
IS THAT WHY
ASHER ISN'T HERE?

19:45.580 --> 19:49.120
WE'RE TAKING A BREAK.
DON'T WORRY. I'M FINE.

19:49.120 --> 19:54.450
OK. LIV, I AM THE QUEEN
OF THE FAKE "I'M FINES."

19:54.450 --> 19:56.590
DO YOU WANT ME
TO KICK HIS ASS?

19:56.590 --> 19:58.360
IT'S NOT JUST ASHER.

19:58.360 --> 19:59.990
YOU KNOW, WITH
THE SHOOTING,

19:59.990 --> 20:01.990
MY DAD LOSING
HIS JOB, I MEAN,

20:01.990 --> 20:04.400
IT'S ONE BAD THING
AFTER ANOTHER.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.530
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST--

20:06.530 --> 20:09.500
I NEED A BREAK
FROM ALL OF IT.

20:13.240 --> 20:15.410
HAROLD: I HEARD
THEY SUSPENDED HIM

20:15.410 --> 20:17.240
BECAUSE HE WAS CAUGHT
WITH LONDON'S WIFE.

20:17.240 --> 20:18.340
WOULDN'T
SURPRISE ME.

20:18.340 --> 20:19.980
ENOUGH, DAD.

20:19.980 --> 20:21.950
I'M SORRY YOU GOT IN
A FIGHT WITH OLIVIA.

20:21.950 --> 20:23.080
YOU KNOW
I LIKE HER, BUT--

20:23.080 --> 20:24.220
WE DIDN'T GET
INTO A FIGHT.

20:24.220 --> 20:25.620
SHE BROKE UP
WITH ME.

20:25.620 --> 20:27.390
YOU FOCUSED ON
THE WRONG BAKER, SON.

20:27.390 --> 20:28.990
HER DAD'S FINALLY GONE.

20:28.990 --> 20:30.220
MAYBE NOW BEVERLY
CAN BRING IN A COACH

20:30.220 --> 20:31.490
WHO REALLY
APPRECIATES YOU.

20:31.490 --> 20:33.490
COACH BAKER DOES
APPRECIATE ME, DAD.

20:33.490 --> 20:35.560
I THINK YOU MEAN
MR. BAKER.

20:35.560 --> 20:37.960
AT BEST, HE SAW
YOU AS A BACKUP

20:37.960 --> 20:40.270
TO HIS GOLDEN BOY
SPENCER.

20:40.270 --> 20:41.400
I TOLD YOU IT WAS
ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

20:41.400 --> 20:42.670
BEFORE
HE SCREWED UP.

20:42.670 --> 20:45.500
YOU KNOW, HE DIDN'T
SCREW UP. I DID.

20:48.110 --> 20:50.240
BLAKE: WELL, IF IT AIN'T THE
QUARTERBACK WITHOUT A TEAM.

20:50.240 --> 20:52.040
YO, WHAT DID
YOU SAY TO ME?

20:52.040 --> 20:53.650
AND STOP TRYING TO STEAL
OUR PLAYERS, DAWG.

20:53.650 --> 20:55.650
HEY, HEY, EASY, D.,
ALL RIGHT? EASY.

20:55.650 --> 20:57.250
YEAH, D. EASY.

20:57.250 --> 20:58.650
YO, WE DIDN'T
STEAL ANYTHING.

20:58.650 --> 21:00.190
YOUR BOY CAM
CAME BEGGING US

21:00.190 --> 21:01.650
TO GET HIM OUT
OF CRENSHAW.

21:01.650 --> 21:04.390
HE CALLS IT
PULLING A SPENCER.

21:04.390 --> 21:06.990
ARE YOU GONNA
TAKE THAT?

21:06.990 --> 21:08.930
I GUESS YOU DON'T STAND UP
TO NOBODY NO MORE.

21:08.930 --> 21:10.130
OH, YOU GOT
TO CHILL, MAN.

21:10.130 --> 21:11.530
I AS. I WAS
CHILLING IN NEVADA

21:11.530 --> 21:13.030
TILL COREY
MADE ME LEAVE.

21:13.030 --> 21:14.400
THEN HE DIED
AND LEFT ME.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.270
SHOULD'VE GONE
WITH MY MOM.

21:16.270 --> 21:18.440
MY ASS COULD'VE BEEN
IN GERMANY RIGHT NOW

21:18.440 --> 21:20.040
MOWING DOWN
BRATWURST.

21:20.040 --> 21:21.570
IT'S NOT LIKE I GOT
A TEAM TO PLAY FOR, EH?

21:21.570 --> 21:23.210
YOU DO GOT A TEAM,
ALL RIGHT?

21:23.210 --> 21:25.040
I KNOW THOSE GUYS.
THEY'RE JUST FRUSTRATED.

21:25.040 --> 21:26.950
TALK TO THEM.
"TALK TO THEM"?

21:26.950 --> 21:29.280
AND SAY WHAT, "HEY,
I KNOW I'M THE NEW KID

21:29.280 --> 21:31.180
IN TOWN, BUT YOU SHOULD
LISTEN TO ME, ANYWAY"?

21:31.180 --> 21:32.690
I COULDN'T EVEN GET THEM
TO COME TO THIS PARTY.

21:32.690 --> 21:34.220
I NEVER SAID THIS
WAS GONNA BE EASY,

21:34.220 --> 21:36.020
ALL RIGHT, BUT WE'RE
GONNA FIGURE IT OUT.

21:36.020 --> 21:38.090
RIGHT. WE.

21:38.090 --> 21:40.230
YO, YOU CAN'T EVEN
FIX YOUR OWN PROBLEM.

21:40.230 --> 21:42.030
YOU CAN TAKE ANOTHER
BULLET AND STILL BE

21:42.030 --> 21:43.700
THE BEST PLAYER ON THE FIELD,
BUT YOU WON'T DO

21:43.700 --> 21:45.560
WHATEVER IT TAKES TO
GET BACK OUT THERE.

21:45.560 --> 21:47.330
YOU NEED TO STOP WORRYING
ABOUT YOUR COACH'S FEELINGS

21:47.330 --> 21:49.070
AND START
WORRYING ABOUT YOURS.

21:49.070 --> 21:52.240
IT'S NOT LIKE ANYBODY ELSE
IS LOOKING OUT FOR US.

22:07.320 --> 22:09.720
HEY, ATHLETIC DIRECTOR HART,

22:09.720 --> 22:13.490
IT'S SPENCER JAMES.

22:20.630 --> 22:23.470
SEE YOU AT
THE GAME, SPENCE.

22:23.470 --> 22:26.000
ACTUALLY, YOU'RE GONNA
SEE ME IN THE GAME, COACH.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.610
SAY WHAT?

22:27.610 --> 22:29.070
A.D. HART
CLEARED ME TO PLAY,

22:29.070 --> 22:30.880
THOUGHT YOU SHOULD
HEAR IT FROM ME FIRST.

22:30.880 --> 22:33.880
FOR REAL? WHEN
DID HE CLEAR YOU?

22:33.880 --> 22:35.880
I TALKED TO HIM
LAST NIGHT. LOOK.

22:35.880 --> 22:37.620
I DIDN'T MEAN TO GO
OVER YOUR HEAD,

22:37.620 --> 22:39.080
BUT YOU DIDN'T
GIVE ME MUCH CHOICE.

22:39.080 --> 22:41.750
LOOK. I THINK YOU'RE
MAKING A MISTAKE HERE, SON.

22:41.750 --> 22:43.560
HE AIN'T THINKING
ABOUT YOUR FUTURE.

22:43.560 --> 22:45.520
MAYBE NOT, BUT THAT'S
ALL I'M THINKING ABOUT.

22:45.520 --> 22:47.490
LAST TIME YOU PLAYED,
YOUR ARM WENT NUMB.

22:47.490 --> 22:48.790
WHAT IF SOMETHING
WORSE HAPPENS?

22:48.790 --> 22:50.030
I NEED YOU TO
TRUST ME ON THIS.

22:50.030 --> 22:51.900
WHY WERE YOU
SUSPENDED?

22:51.900 --> 22:53.570
WE AIN'T TALKING
ABOUT THAT RIGHT NOW.

22:53.570 --> 22:55.700
I'M SORRY, COACH,

22:55.700 --> 23:00.510
BUT TRUST'S SUPPOSED TO
WORK BOTH WAYS, RIGHT?

23:00.510 --> 23:03.080
WISH ME LUCK.

23:11.050 --> 23:13.790
♪ GET GONE, GET GONE,
WHAT'S UP? ♪

23:13.790 --> 23:16.660
MAN, ON P.A.: WELCOME
TO THE DIAMOND 7-ON-7

23:16.660 --> 23:18.460
FOOTBALL LEAGUE JAMBOREE.

23:18.460 --> 23:20.660
THIS IS A DOUBLE-ELIMINATION
TOURNAMENT

23:20.660 --> 23:23.000
WITH THE BEST TEAMS
FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

23:23.000 --> 23:25.730
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ANY MORE
ABOUT MY DAD'S OFFER?

23:25.730 --> 23:28.200
WELL, WHAT'S UP, LAYLA?
GOOD TO SEE YOU, TOO.

23:28.200 --> 23:29.970
SORRY. I JUST--

23:29.970 --> 23:31.470
I KNOW YOU HATE
SMALL TALK.

23:31.470 --> 23:32.740
VERY TRUE.

23:32.740 --> 23:33.940
IT'S CRAZY THAT
I'M EVEN CONSIDERING

23:33.940 --> 23:35.210
SAYING NO, RIGHT?

23:35.210 --> 23:37.210
NOT NECESSARILY.
WHY ARE YOU?

23:37.210 --> 23:41.080
LOT OF REASONS--
PATIENCE, FOR ONE--

23:41.080 --> 23:43.720
AND WHAT IF ME AND YOUR
DAD JUST DON'T MIX?

23:43.720 --> 23:45.220
LIKE, HE CAME AROUND
EVENTUALLY,

23:45.220 --> 23:47.890
BUT HE WAS NOT EXACTLY
FEELING ME AT FIRST.

23:47.890 --> 23:49.590
YEAH, AND THEN
YOU SOLD HIM

23:49.590 --> 23:51.560
BECAUSE YOU'D
SELL ANYONE.

23:51.560 --> 23:53.630
YOU'RE THE REAL
DEAL, COOP.

23:53.630 --> 23:56.230
WHAT DO I KNOW ABOUT
SIGNING A BIG CONTRACT?

23:56.230 --> 23:57.830
I MESS AROUND,
CHECK THE WRONG BOX,

23:57.830 --> 23:59.600
I HAVE TO RAP
NAKED OR SOMETHING.

23:59.600 --> 24:01.770
OK. I WILL LOOK AT
THE CONTRACT FOR YOU

24:01.770 --> 24:03.240
AND MAKE SURE YOU GET

24:03.240 --> 24:05.600
THE BEST FULLY CLOTHED
DEAL POSSIBLE.

24:05.600 --> 24:07.710
SO YOU THINK I SHOULD
TAKE THE DEAL.

24:07.710 --> 24:10.280
I WANT WHAT'S
BEST FOR YOU,

24:10.280 --> 24:12.510
AND, EVEN THOUGH
I WOULD REALLY MISS

24:12.510 --> 24:15.280
WORKING WITH YOU, I THINK
YOU SHOULD TAKE THE DEAL.

24:15.280 --> 24:17.580
YOU'RE TOO GOOD
NOT TO.

24:17.580 --> 24:21.120
IT WOULD BE LIKE SPENCER
NOT PLAYING FOOTBALL.

24:28.060 --> 24:30.600
BILLY, HOLD UP
A SECOND.

24:32.730 --> 24:35.300
I WANTED TO THANK YOU
FOR HELPING ASHER

24:35.300 --> 24:37.600
WITH HIS...
LITTLE PROBLEM.

24:37.600 --> 24:39.000
OH. WELL,
HE'S A GOOD KID.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.270
I--I JUST WISH I
COULD HELP HIM OUT

24:41.270 --> 24:44.780
WITH HIS BIG PROBLEM.

24:44.780 --> 24:47.610
DON'T JUDGE ME,
BAKER.

24:47.610 --> 24:49.310
MAYBE I SHOULD
ASK YOUR WIFE

24:49.310 --> 24:51.920
HOW PERFECT YOU ARE.

24:55.020 --> 24:57.190
DO YOU KNOW WHY ASHER
PUSHES HIMSELF SO HARD?

24:57.190 --> 24:58.660
BECAUSE
HE LOVES FOOTBALL,

24:58.660 --> 24:59.890
WHEN YOU LET HIM
PLAY, ANYWAY.

24:59.890 --> 25:01.760
NO. HE PLAYS BECAUSE
HE LOVES IT.

25:01.760 --> 25:04.160
HE ALMOST KILLS HIMSELF
BECAUSE YOU LOVE IT.

25:04.160 --> 25:06.100
WHY DO YOU THINK HIS
LITTLE PROBLEM EVEN STARTED?

25:06.100 --> 25:07.630
SO IT'S MY FAULT NOW?

25:07.630 --> 25:09.840
ALL HE WANTS TO DO
IS MAKE YOU PROUD,

25:09.840 --> 25:11.840
BUT NOTHING HE DOES
IS GOOD ENOUGH.

25:11.840 --> 25:13.940
ASHER IS A GREAT PLAYER
ON THE FIELD.

25:13.940 --> 25:15.910
HE'S AN EVEN BETTER
MAN OFF OF IT.

25:15.910 --> 25:18.910
START PAYING
ATTENTION.

25:20.650 --> 25:22.080
ALL RIGHT. LET'S
GET IT, FELLAS.

25:22.080 --> 25:23.920
THEY AIN'T GOT NOTHING
ON US, ALL RIGHT?

25:23.920 --> 25:25.320
AND DON'T THINK ABOUT
HOW COOL THEY LOOKED

25:25.320 --> 25:27.190
IN THEIR SMOKING JACKETS
OR HOW THAT HOT GIRL

25:27.190 --> 25:29.920
YOU TALKED TO ALL NIGHT
WENT HOME WITH NUMBER 8.

25:29.920 --> 25:32.690
ASHER: WORST
PEP TALK EVER, MAN.

25:32.690 --> 25:33.860
OH, YEAH?
WHAT IF I SAID--

25:33.860 --> 25:35.660
DON'T TRY
TO TOP IT.

25:35.660 --> 25:37.200
JUST BECAUSE WE GOT KILLED
LAST TIME COACH BAKER

25:37.200 --> 25:39.600
WASN'T HERE, DOESN'T MEAN
IT HAS TO HAPPEN AGAIN.

25:39.600 --> 25:41.700

HEY...

27:18.930 --> 27:20.700
OOF!

27:40.550 --> 27:42.620
THANK YOU,
JORDAN.

27:42.620 --> 27:45.520
AFTER YOUR FIGHT
WITH DANE,

27:45.520 --> 27:47.560
HE'S ADMITTED
TO BEING THE FATHER

27:47.560 --> 27:49.530
AND PROMISED TO TAKE
CARE OF US FOREVER.

27:49.530 --> 27:51.030
WELL, I'M GLAD I
COULD HELP, SIMONE.

27:51.030 --> 27:52.230
WHAT WERE YOU
THINKING?

27:52.230 --> 27:53.530
I DON'T KNOW, OK?

27:53.530 --> 27:55.030
I GUESS I JUST WANTED
HIM TO FEEL SOME

27:55.030 --> 27:56.570
OF THE PAIN HE WAS
PUTTING YOU THROUGH.

27:56.570 --> 27:58.270
OH, AND I'M SUPPOSED
TO BELIEVE YOU DID THAT

27:58.270 --> 28:00.500
AS A FRIEND?

28:00.500 --> 28:02.310
I LIKE YOU.

28:02.310 --> 28:05.380
IS THAT REALLY
SUCH A BAD THING?

28:05.380 --> 28:07.410
YES.

28:07.410 --> 28:10.150
JORDAN, MY LIFE
IS A MESS AS IT IS,

28:10.150 --> 28:12.420
AND I DON'T NEED YOU
COMING TO MY RESCUE,

28:12.420 --> 28:15.450
SO JUST GO LIVE YOUR LIFE
AND STAY OUT OF MINE.

28:21.430 --> 28:23.190
WHA--
YEAH.

28:23.190 --> 28:24.600
WELL, YOU WERE
RIGHT, LIV.

28:24.600 --> 28:27.060
I SHOULD'VE JUST
STAYED OUT OF IT.

28:27.060 --> 28:28.400
SIMONE DOESN'T
CARE ABOUT ME.

28:28.400 --> 28:30.130
SHE DOESN'T EVEN
LIKE ME.

28:30.130 --> 28:32.140
GO AHEAD AND
CALL ME STUPID.

28:32.140 --> 28:35.140
WELL, I CAN NEVER
PASS THAT CHANCE UP.

28:35.140 --> 28:37.410
SHE OBVIOUSLY
LIKES YOU. YES.

28:37.410 --> 28:40.080
IF SHE DIDN'T, SHE
WOULD'VE KEPT USING YOU,

28:40.080 --> 28:42.080
BUT INSTEAD, SHE'S TRYING
TO HANDLE IT ALL ALONE

28:42.080 --> 28:45.320
SO THAT YOU DON'T
GET HURT, STUPID.

28:47.480 --> 28:49.450
AND THERE IT IS.
LISTEN.

28:49.450 --> 28:51.690
I KNOW YOU WANT
TO HELP HER,

28:51.690 --> 28:54.090
BUT THERE'S REALLY
NOTHING THAT YOU CAN DO.

28:54.090 --> 28:56.190
YOU'RE NOT HER FAMILY,
AND RIGHT NOW,

28:56.190 --> 28:58.060
THAT'S WHO SHE
NEEDS THE MOST...

28:59.560 --> 29:02.500
JUST LIKE
YOU NEED ME.

29:02.500 --> 29:03.570
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

29:03.570 --> 29:05.740
GIVE ME A HUG.
NO.

29:05.740 --> 29:06.740
COME ON.
GIVE ME A HUG.

29:06.740 --> 29:07.740
HA HA HA!
COME ON.

29:07.740 --> 29:08.770
JUST LET IT HAPPEN.

29:08.770 --> 29:10.610
GET OFF OF ME.
STOP IT.

29:14.710 --> 29:17.210
DAD, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

29:17.210 --> 29:18.720
I'M HERE
BECAUSE OF ASHER.

29:21.520 --> 29:25.720
ACTUALLY, HE WAS
SUSPENDED BECAUSE OF ME.

29:25.720 --> 29:28.190
COACH CAUGHT ME
USING STEROIDS,

29:28.190 --> 29:30.330
AND HE COULD'VE
TURNED ME IN,

29:30.330 --> 29:31.730
BUT HE HELPED ME
GET CLEAN,

29:31.730 --> 29:33.200
AND HE TOOK
THE BLAME INSTEAD.

29:33.200 --> 29:35.330
STEROIDS, ASH?
REALLY?

29:35.330 --> 29:38.200
WISH I COULD SAY I WAS
DOING IT FOR THE TEAM, MAN.

29:38.200 --> 29:40.270
I WANTED US TO WIN,
NO MATTER THE COST,

29:40.270 --> 29:42.740
BUT THE TRUTH IS, I WAS ONLY
LOOKING OUT FOR MYSELF.

29:42.740 --> 29:46.880
I WANTED TO BE BETTER
THAN EVERYONE,

29:46.880 --> 29:49.480
NO MATTER
WHAT THE COST.

29:51.480 --> 29:54.250
YO, SHUT UP,
GUYS, ALL RIGHT?

29:54.250 --> 29:55.890
LOOK. WE ALL
MAKE MISTAKES.

29:55.890 --> 29:58.360
SINCE WHEN DON'T WE
HAVE EACH OTHER'S BACKS?

29:58.360 --> 30:00.620
NO. IT'S COOL, MAN.
THEY SHOULD BE ANGRY.

30:00.620 --> 30:02.660
I WOULD BE.
I'M TEAM CAPTAIN.

30:02.660 --> 30:04.900
I'M SUPPOSED TO
LEAD BY EXAMPLE.

30:04.900 --> 30:08.370
I LET YOU ALL DOWN,
AND I'M SORRY.

30:08.370 --> 30:10.500
I CONFESSED TO
PRINCIPAL LONDON.

30:10.500 --> 30:12.170
SO YOU
OFF THE TEAM?

30:12.170 --> 30:13.900
SUSPENDED
INDEFINITELY.

30:13.900 --> 30:15.910
ALL THAT MATTERS IS,
COACH IS BACK.

30:15.910 --> 30:17.570
YOU GUYS NEED SOMEONE
WHO CARES MORE

30:17.570 --> 30:19.910
ABOUT YOU THAN
HIMSELF, SO...

30:19.910 --> 30:22.380
THANKS, COACH.

30:27.180 --> 30:29.790
GIVE THEM
HELL, BOYS.

30:33.720 --> 30:36.260
OK. BACK TO BUSINESS,

30:36.260 --> 30:40.260
WE ARE GOING TO FORGET
THAT TOTALLY AVOIDABLE LOSS.

30:40.260 --> 30:41.700
WANT Y'ALL TO
FINISH SUITING UP.

30:41.700 --> 30:43.870
I WILL BE BACK WITH
A NEW GAME PLAN.

30:43.870 --> 30:47.340
SPOILER ALERT--
IT INVOLVES WINNING.

30:47.340 --> 30:49.410
SPENCE,
CAN I GET A WORD?

30:53.840 --> 30:56.350
HAVE A SEAT.

30:57.950 --> 30:59.720
SO I'M GUESSING
I'M BENCHED.

30:59.720 --> 31:01.320
NOW, WHY WOULD
YOU THINK THAT,

31:01.320 --> 31:02.620
BECAUSE YOU REFUSED
TO LISTEN TO ME

31:02.620 --> 31:03.950
AND THEN WENT
BEHIND MY BACK

31:03.950 --> 31:05.560
TO GET
YOUR OWN WAY?

31:05.560 --> 31:07.590
YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.
LOOK.

31:07.590 --> 31:09.230
I REALLY DON'T
WANT TO LOSE

31:09.230 --> 31:10.690
MY TWO BEST RECEIVERS
IN THE SAME DAY,

31:10.690 --> 31:14.630
BUT I CAN'T HAVE YOU
PLAYING THIS WAY,

31:14.630 --> 31:16.830
SO I'M GONNA HAVE
YOU PUT THIS ON

31:16.830 --> 31:19.470
TO PROTECT
YOUR SHOULDER.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.870
WON'T THIS
LIMIT MY REACH?

31:23.870 --> 31:26.240
NOT AS MUCH AS SITTING
ON THE BENCH WILL.

31:26.240 --> 31:27.740
I THINK THE BRACE
IS GREAT.

31:27.740 --> 31:29.510
LOOK. WE'LL DESIGN
PLAYS AROUND IT,

31:29.510 --> 31:31.980
AND, WELL, YOU'RE JUST
GONNA HAVE TO TRUST ME.

31:31.980 --> 31:34.620
YES, SIR.

31:35.920 --> 31:37.790
WELCOME BACK, COACH.

31:42.490 --> 31:45.000
HEY.
WHAT'S UP?

31:45.000 --> 31:47.600
SORRY I'M LATE. THIS
PLACE IS LIKE A MAZE.

31:47.600 --> 31:48.800
WHAT'D I MISS?

31:48.800 --> 31:50.000
MAN, NOTHING MUCH.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.640
BEVERLY LOST
THEIR FIRST GAME,

31:51.640 --> 31:54.370
AND J.P. WANTS
TO SIGN ME.

31:54.370 --> 31:55.870
WAIT. FOR REAL?

31:55.870 --> 31:57.610
OH, THEY LOOKED BAD.

31:57.610 --> 31:58.880
LIKE, I'M HOPING THEY
CAN TURN IT AROUND.

31:58.880 --> 32:00.480
COOP.

32:00.480 --> 32:02.010
HE TOLD ME LAST NIGHT
AT THE PARTY.

32:02.010 --> 32:03.480
WHAT? THAT'S HUGE.

32:03.480 --> 32:05.020
OH, MY GOD,
CONGRATULATIONS.

32:05.020 --> 32:06.480
LIKE, WHY ARE YOU JUST
TELLING ME RIGHT NOW?

32:06.480 --> 32:07.650
LOOK. I PROMISED
I WOULDN'T LET MUSIC

32:07.650 --> 32:09.390
COME BETWEEN US AGAIN,
ALL RIGHT,

32:09.390 --> 32:10.690
AND IF I SAY YES, THAT MEANS
WE GO ON TOUR TOGETHER,

32:10.690 --> 32:12.420
WHICH ALSO MEANS
WE'LL BE COMPETING

32:12.420 --> 32:14.360
FOR J.P.'s ATTENTION
EVERY NIGHT.

32:14.360 --> 32:16.030
WHY? YOU SAID NOTHING
WOULD MAKE YOU HAPPIER

32:16.030 --> 32:17.560
THAN SEEING ME
BLOW UP, RIGHT?

32:17.560 --> 32:18.930
YEAH.

32:18.930 --> 32:20.500
AND I FEEL THE SAME
WAY ABOUT YOU,

32:20.500 --> 32:21.800
AND I'M SURE J.P.
FEELS THAT WAY

32:21.800 --> 32:22.900
ABOUT EVERY ARTIST
ON HIS LABEL.

32:22.900 --> 32:24.500
AND THAT'S
ANOTHER THING.

32:24.500 --> 32:25.770
LAST TIME LAYLA BROUGHT
ME INTO THE STUDIO,

32:25.770 --> 32:26.770
IT DIDN'T EXACTLY
WORK OUT, ALL RIGHT,

32:26.770 --> 32:27.970
AND YOU KNOW ME.

32:27.970 --> 32:29.640
I'M MY BEST WHEN
I CAN BE MYSELF,

32:29.640 --> 32:31.940
AND WHAT IF J.P.
TRIES TO CHANGE ME?

32:31.940 --> 32:34.380
YOU KNOW, YOU JUST GOT
TO BE UP FRONT WITH HIM,

32:34.380 --> 32:36.510
AND, AS MUCH AS I WOULD
LOVE TO TRAVEL THE COUNTRY

32:36.510 --> 32:38.680
WITH YOU, I WOULDN'T
WANT YOU TO SIGN

32:38.680 --> 32:41.080
WITH ANYBODY WHO DOESN'T
LOVE YOU FOR YOU.

32:41.080 --> 32:43.520
IT WOULD BE COOL TO GO
ON TOUR TOGETHER.

32:43.520 --> 32:45.960
YES. IT WOULD,
BUT YOU ARE STILL

32:45.960 --> 32:47.520
NOT TAKING
YOUR SONG BACK.

32:47.520 --> 32:48.690
GOOD STUFF.

32:56.530 --> 32:58.600
I NEVER GOT ALONG
WITH MY FATHER.

32:58.600 --> 33:01.710
HE WAS TOO DEMANDING,
DIDN'T LISTEN.

33:01.710 --> 33:05.610
PROMISED MYSELF I'D
NEVER BE LIKE THAT.

33:05.610 --> 33:08.550
I GUESS I BROKE
THAT PROMISE, HUH?

33:08.550 --> 33:10.550
I'VE BROKEN A FEW
MYSELF LATELY.

33:10.550 --> 33:13.820
I NEVER WANT YOU FEELING
LIKE YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

33:13.820 --> 33:16.420
YOU ARE.

33:16.420 --> 33:18.560
I KNOW I LET YOU DOWN.
NO.

33:18.560 --> 33:23.090
WHAT YOU DID TODAY
TOOK GUTS,

33:23.090 --> 33:25.360
MORE THAN I EVER HAD.

33:25.360 --> 33:27.360
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

33:39.980 --> 33:42.050
ALL RIGHT, GENTLEMEN.
HERE WE GO.

33:42.050 --> 33:44.450
ALL WE GOT TO DO
IS FOLLOW THIS GAME PLAN,

33:44.450 --> 33:46.120
WE'LL BE CELEBRATING TONIGHT.

33:46.120 --> 33:49.150
WE'LL USE MOTIONS AND SHIFTS
TO KEEP THE DEFENSE OFF BALANCE.

33:49.150 --> 33:51.860
WIDE 35. HEY.

33:56.460 --> 33:58.500
BILLY, VOICE-OVER: WE'LL SLIDE
SPENCER OFF THE SLOT,

33:58.500 --> 34:00.600
HIT QUICK SCREENS.

34:05.940 --> 34:07.900
OH.

34:07.900 --> 34:09.770
MAN: ♪ YOU'RE ABOUT TO FEEL
THE POWER OF A PHENOM ♪

34:09.770 --> 34:11.610
BILLY, VOICE-OVER:
Y'ALL KNOW THE DEAL--

34:11.610 --> 34:13.140
QUICK STOPS AT THE STICKS.

34:13.140 --> 34:15.480
BEND THEM TILL THEY BREAK.

34:17.880 --> 34:19.420
BILLY, VOICE-OVER:
Y'ALL GOT SOMETHING RIGHT HERE

34:19.420 --> 34:21.080
NOT A LOT OF TEAMS EVER GET.

34:21.080 --> 34:24.620
IT'S CALLED A SECOND CHANCE.
WESTLAKE DIDN'T BEAT US.

34:24.620 --> 34:26.890
WE BEAT OURSELVES,
BUT Y'ALL KNOW THAT.

34:26.890 --> 34:30.190
THE QUESTION IS, ARE WE GONNA
LET THAT HAPPEN AGAIN?

34:30.190 --> 34:31.330
N'UH-UH. I CAN HEAR YOU.

34:31.330 --> 34:33.660
THE QUESTION IS, ARE WE GONNA
LET THAT HAPPEN AGAIN?

34:33.660 --> 34:34.200
NO, SIR.
NO, SIR.

34:34.200 --> 34:34.660
ARE WE?

34:34.660 --> 34:35.000
NO, SIR.
NO, SIR.

34:35.000 --> 34:35.470
ARE WE?

34:35.470 --> 34:36.530
NO, SIR.
NO, SIR.

34:36.530 --> 34:37.230
GET IT DONE.

34:37.230 --> 34:37.830
YOU KNOW,
"BEVERLY" ON 3.

34:37.830 --> 34:39.040
"BEVERLY" ON ME.
1, 2, 3.

34:39.040 --> 34:40.200
BEVERLY!
BEVERLY!

34:40.200 --> 34:42.210
ASHER: WHOO!
COME ON, BEVERLY!

34:42.210 --> 34:44.410
OH, YOU GOT THIS!

34:48.110 --> 34:51.210
HEY, LET'S SEE THAT
TRICK CRAP AGAIN, HUH?

34:51.210 --> 34:54.450
NAH. WE'RE JUST GONNA BEAT
YOU HEAD ON THIS TIME.

34:54.450 --> 34:58.790
HEY, WIDE 8.
WIDE 8. SET.

35:02.930 --> 35:04.530
UHH!

35:07.530 --> 35:08.930
WIDE 9.

35:12.240 --> 35:13.800
UH!

35:17.710 --> 35:19.540
OK.

35:19.540 --> 35:22.580
JORDAN: OK. ONE TOUCHDOWN,
THE GAME IS OURS, BOYS.

35:22.580 --> 35:23.810
AW, STATE CHAMPS.
YEAH.

35:23.810 --> 35:24.980
NOT NOW, J.J.

35:24.980 --> 35:26.550
YO, WE GOT TO
SWITCH THINGS UP.

35:26.550 --> 35:27.850
I'VE BEEN CATCHING
SHORT PASSES ALL DAY.

35:27.850 --> 35:29.150
THEY ALREADY KNOW
WHAT'S COMING.

35:29.150 --> 35:30.690
LET ME GO DEEP.
I CAN BURN THEM.

35:30.690 --> 35:31.860
I JUST GOT TO LOOSEN
MY BRACE. COME ON.

35:31.860 --> 35:33.560
NO. STICK TO THE
PLAN, ALL RIGHT?

35:33.560 --> 35:34.960
IF YOU GET HURT, I'LL
NEVER LIVE IT DOWN.

35:34.960 --> 35:36.760
I GOT A UCLA RECRUITER
IN THE STANDS, MAN.

35:36.760 --> 35:39.100
YOU WANT TO WIN, RIGHT?
LET ME LOOSEN MY BRACE.

35:39.100 --> 35:41.730
OK. FINE. FINE.

35:41.730 --> 35:43.900
I'LL GIVE YOU ONE, BUT I'M
NOT GONNA RISK IT AGAIN.

35:43.900 --> 35:45.700
ONE'S ALL I NEED.

35:45.700 --> 35:47.170
ALL RIGHT.
Z SPOT 725.

35:47.170 --> 35:49.140
STOP AND GO
ON ONE ON ONE.

35:49.140 --> 35:50.710
READY?
BREAK.

35:50.710 --> 35:51.910
HERE WE GO.

35:53.010 --> 35:56.650
SHIFTY SHIFTY. WIDE 8.
WIDE 33.

35:56.650 --> 35:59.180
WIDE 30. SET.

36:05.720 --> 36:08.860
UH! AH! HUH...

36:08.860 --> 36:10.530
YEAH!

36:10.530 --> 36:12.000
YES!

36:38.020 --> 36:39.660
NOW YOU CAN SAY IT.

36:39.660 --> 36:43.090
YO, STATE CHAMPS,
BABY! WHOO HOO HOO!

36:43.090 --> 36:45.660
WHOO HOO HOO HOO HOO!

36:53.740 --> 36:55.070
WILSON: WHAT A GAME.

36:55.070 --> 36:56.270
I'LL LET
COACH KELLY KNOW

36:56.270 --> 36:58.270
THAT SPENCER JAMES
IS BACK.

36:58.270 --> 36:59.910
DOES THAT MEAN MY
SCHOLARSHIP'S BACK, TOO?

36:59.910 --> 37:01.180
IF I HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY ABOUT IT.

37:01.180 --> 37:02.950
YOU'RE DEFINITELY
BRUIN MATERIAL.

37:02.950 --> 37:04.280
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

37:04.280 --> 37:06.780
I APPRECIATE YOU,
COACH. THANK YOU.

37:06.780 --> 37:09.080
DARNELL: YO, I HAVEN'T
SEEN YOU BALL LIKE THAT

37:09.080 --> 37:11.090
SINCE I MOVED HERE.

37:11.090 --> 37:13.890
UCLA's GOT TO BE
A DONE DEAL NOW.

37:13.890 --> 37:16.230
MAN, I HOPE SO.

37:16.230 --> 37:18.690
MAN, I'M SORRY
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

37:18.690 --> 37:20.330
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I WAS THINKING.

37:20.330 --> 37:22.830
I DON'T EVEN
LIKE BRATWURST.

37:22.830 --> 37:25.030
YOU GOT EVERY RIGHT
TO BE MAD, MAN.

37:25.030 --> 37:27.470
BESIDES, YOU THE ONE
THAT HELPED ME FIND

37:27.470 --> 37:29.200
MY WAY BACK
ON THAT FIELD.

37:29.200 --> 37:31.770
YO, WATCHING YOU GRIND
IT OUT MADE ME REALIZE

37:31.770 --> 37:33.940
I CAN'T GIVE UP
ON SOUTH CRENSHAW.

37:33.940 --> 37:35.780
THAT WAS COREY'S HOME.

37:35.780 --> 37:39.180
HE WOULDN'T WANT IT GOING
DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT.

37:39.180 --> 37:40.780
LAYLA: OK. MY FATHER'S
A BUSINESSMAN,

37:40.780 --> 37:42.120
SO DON'T TAKE
HIS FIRST OFFER,

37:42.120 --> 37:44.050
AND HE'S TOUGH, BUT
DON'T BE INTIMIDATED

37:44.050 --> 37:46.790
AND COMPLIMENT HIS TIE
UNLESS HE ISN'T

37:46.790 --> 37:48.360
WEARING ONE BUT DON'T
COMPLIMENT HIS SHIRT.

37:48.360 --> 37:49.830
HE HATES THAT
FOR SOME REASON.

37:49.830 --> 37:51.930
LAYLA,
WE ARE COOL, OK?

37:51.930 --> 37:53.800
HOW MANY MORE TIMES WE
GOT TO GO OVER THIS?

37:53.800 --> 37:55.130
I TOLD YOU,
I GOT YOU.

37:55.130 --> 37:56.930
J.P.: LADIES.

37:56.930 --> 37:58.970
HEY, PRINCESS.
WHAT'S UP, COOP?

37:58.970 --> 38:00.400
WHAT'S UP?
ALL RIGHT.

38:00.400 --> 38:02.740
HERE WE GO.

38:02.740 --> 38:04.870
IT'S PRETTY
STANDARD.

38:04.870 --> 38:06.880
IF YOU HAVE
ANY QUESTIONS,

38:06.880 --> 38:09.340
JUST ASK.

38:16.520 --> 38:18.090
THAT'S A NICE PEN.

38:18.090 --> 38:20.390
IT'S YOURS
ONCE YOU SIGN.

38:20.390 --> 38:23.090
I'M GONNA
HAVE TO PASS.

38:23.090 --> 38:25.130
ON THE PEN
OR THE DEAL?

38:25.130 --> 38:27.160
UH, YOU NEED TO LET HIM
MAKE THE OFFER FIRST

38:27.160 --> 38:28.960
BEFORE YOU REJECT IT.
LOOK.

38:28.960 --> 38:30.830
I'M SORRY, MR. KEATING.

38:30.830 --> 38:32.830
I CAN'T SIGN WITH YOU.
I GOT SOMEBODY ELSE IN MIND.

38:32.830 --> 38:34.170
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THEY'LL DO MORE

38:34.170 --> 38:35.500
FOR YOU
THAN I WILL?

38:35.500 --> 38:36.970
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT WHAT I DO KNOW

38:36.970 --> 38:38.970
IS THAT SHE'LL
LET ME DO ME.

38:38.970 --> 38:40.910
I KNOW THAT SHE'S BEEN THERE
SINCE DAY ONE AND HAS MY BACK,

38:40.910 --> 38:44.450
AND I KNOW YOU LIKE HER
BECAUSE HER LAST NAME'S KEATING.

38:46.980 --> 38:49.520
SO WHAT YOU THINK?
WILL YOU SIGN ME?

38:49.520 --> 38:51.520
HEH. ME?
YEAH.

38:51.520 --> 38:53.260
COOP, I'M
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

38:53.260 --> 38:54.890
LAYLA, I'M IN
HIGH SCHOOL, TOO.

38:54.890 --> 38:56.460
YEAH. WELL, I DON'T
EVEN HAVE A LABEL.

38:56.460 --> 38:59.860
OK, SO START ONE,
AND I SUGGEST YOU HURRY UP

38:59.860 --> 39:02.000
BECAUSE YOUR NEW CLIENT'S
KIND OF A DIVA.

39:03.800 --> 39:07.140
HEY, I DID SAY YOU HAD
A FUTURE IN PRODUCING.

39:07.140 --> 39:10.270
I GUESS THAT FUTURE
STARTS TODAY.

39:10.270 --> 39:11.570
COOP: SEE?

39:11.570 --> 39:13.280
JUST DON'T STEAL
ALL MY CLIENTS.

39:13.280 --> 39:14.580
TRUST ME, SHE AIN'T GONNA
HAVE NO TIME FOR THAT.

39:14.580 --> 39:17.150
SHE GONNA BE WAY
TOO BUSY WITH ME.

39:17.150 --> 39:19.010
I WARNED YOU.

39:19.010 --> 39:21.420
UM...HA HA!

39:27.020 --> 39:29.290
I DON'T APPRECIATE
BEING SUMMONED.

39:29.290 --> 39:31.760
AREN'T YOU EVEN GONNA
ASK HOW SIMONE IS?

39:42.470 --> 39:44.570
HOW'S SIMONE?

39:44.570 --> 39:46.840
SHE'S NOT GREAT,
AND SHE'S GONNA BE

39:46.840 --> 39:49.440
PRETTY UPSET WITH ME WHEN
SHE FINDS OUT I'M HERE.

39:49.440 --> 39:51.980
SHE TOLD ME TO
STAY OUT OF IT.

39:51.980 --> 39:54.480
SHE'S ALWAYS BEEN
INDEPENDENT, SO--

39:57.050 --> 39:59.190
MRS. HICKS, THE LAST
TIME WE WERE HERE,

39:59.190 --> 40:01.590
YOU DID ALL
THE TALKING.

40:01.590 --> 40:03.630
OK. NOW I NEED YOU
TO BE QUIET

40:03.630 --> 40:07.060
AND LISTEN, PLEASE.

40:12.130 --> 40:14.000
OK. YOUR DAUGHTER--

40:14.000 --> 40:17.610
HEH. YOUR DAUGHTER
IS A SMART, KIND,

40:17.610 --> 40:20.540
AMAZING WOMAN, OK,
AND RIGHT NOW,

40:20.540 --> 40:23.080
SHE NEEDS HER FAMILY

40:23.080 --> 40:25.610
MORE THAN ANYTHING
ELSE IN THE WORLD.

40:25.610 --> 40:27.980
I UNDERSTAND...

40:53.280 --> 40:54.510
SORRY TO INTERRUPT.

40:54.510 --> 40:56.380
CONGRATULATIONS
ON THE BIG WIN.

40:56.380 --> 40:57.980
I'M GLAD TO SEE
YOU'RE BACK TO FORM.

40:57.980 --> 41:00.520
MVP.
THANKS.

41:00.520 --> 41:04.990
I JUST WANTED
TO THANK COACH BAKER.

41:04.990 --> 41:07.290
WE WOULDN'T HAVE WON THAT
JAMBOREE WITHOUT YOU, SIR.

41:07.290 --> 41:10.130
WE'RE NOT EVEN
THE SAME TEAM WITHOUT YOU.

41:10.130 --> 41:13.130
THANKS FOR ALWAYS
HAVING OUR BACKS.

41:13.130 --> 41:15.930
BILLY: WELL, YOU
AIN'T SO BAD YOURSELF.

41:15.930 --> 41:17.330
NOW GO ON.
GET OUT OF HERE.

41:17.330 --> 41:19.300
CELEBRATE.
YOU DESERVE IT.

41:19.300 --> 41:22.340
OH, AND YOU MIGHT WANT
TO CHECK YOUR BRACE.

41:22.340 --> 41:25.340
IT LOOKED A LITTLE LOOSE
DURING THAT LAST PLAY.

41:28.680 --> 41:30.410
DOES HE KNOW
YOUR REINSTATEMENT

41:30.410 --> 41:32.010
IS ONLY TEMPORARY?

41:32.010 --> 41:33.420
AW, THERE'S NOT POINT
IN GETTING THE TEAM

41:33.420 --> 41:37.050
WORRIED FOR NOTHING,
OR SHOULD I BE WORRIED?

41:37.050 --> 41:39.620
YOU LIED ABOUT A PLAYER'S
STEROID USE, BILLY.

41:39.620 --> 41:41.560
IT OPENED UP
A WHOLE CAN OF WORMS.

41:41.560 --> 41:43.290
NOW THE PRESSURE'S
ON ME AND A.D. HART

41:43.290 --> 41:46.230
TO INVESTIGATE YOU
AND YOUR WHOLE PROGRAM.

41:46.230 --> 41:49.460
THIS COULD GET A LOT WORSE
BEFORE IT GETS BETTER.

42:20.060 --> 42:21.060
MAN: GREG,
MOVE YOUR HEAD.
