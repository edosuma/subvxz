WEBVTT

00:01.134 --> 00:03.546
All you have to do is drop it off

00:03.804 --> 00:05.784
and you're in for a full cut.

00:10.210 --> 00:14.090
That punk kid of mine
never flunked out of A&M.

00:14.147 --> 00:15.524
He got thrown out!

00:15.582 --> 00:17.789
You really do have a way with words.

00:20.220 --> 00:22.097
The big guy carries a gun.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.834
Cece!

00:28.295 --> 00:29.399
Cece!

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074

01:52.412 --> 01:54.358
Let's go, Alvin. Let's go.

01:57.250 --> 01:58.490
Stop that plane.

01:58.552 --> 01:59.622
It's a bust!

01:59.686 --> 02:01.290
This is the DEA.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.397
Come out with your hands up!

02:03.457 --> 02:04.765
DEA!

02:04.891 --> 02:06.837
Come out! Right now!

02:07.427 --> 02:09.270
This is the DEA.

02:09.795 --> 02:12.800
Now, Hawke, you know you
can't rush a starter generator.

02:14.601 --> 02:15.978
- Hi, guys!
- Hey, Dom!

02:16.036 --> 02:18.414
There she is, that little beauty!

02:18.472 --> 02:19.849
How are ya, sweetheart?

02:19.906 --> 02:22.113
How's it coming, for our girl?

02:22.976 --> 02:24.250
2 days.

02:24.311 --> 02:25.984
2 days?

02:26.079 --> 02:28.081
Oh! Frank!

02:28.148 --> 02:29.718
Dom.

02:31.218 --> 02:32.253
Jalapeno?

02:32.319 --> 02:33.423
Sure.

02:34.021 --> 02:35.329
Have one.

02:36.356 --> 02:38.233
Time to go. Come on. Come on, come on.

02:38.291 --> 02:39.793
See you, Frank.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.032
Well, how do ya like that?

02:41.094 --> 02:43.040
Hey, Dom! My Mom made these!

02:47.134 --> 02:48.579
You know, it doesn't seem right

02:48.635 --> 02:50.637
leaving Frank to do
that work all by himself.

02:50.704 --> 02:53.207
Oh, he never did like me
looking over his shoulder.

02:54.141 --> 02:57.679
Besides, how often does Dom invite
you out to meet his best friend?

02:59.312 --> 03:02.452
What is this best friend
anyway, Dom? A gopher?

03:03.550 --> 03:06.724
Horned toad maybe. A gopher
couldn't stand it out here.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.971
Come on, Carnes! Give him a shot!

03:50.464 --> 03:52.705
I told you, Cece, you could do it, huh?

03:52.766 --> 03:53.938
I told you, Cece.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.412
You knocked the heck
out of him with that one.

03:58.171 --> 03:59.616
Hey man, it's Dom!

04:01.108 --> 04:03.145
Hey, Uncle Dom!

04:03.210 --> 04:04.450
All right!

04:04.511 --> 04:07.321
Ah, you got a right just like your old man!

04:11.651 --> 04:13.824
Hey, I know you. Dad's got
a picture of you at home.

04:13.887 --> 04:15.798
You're that war hero, aren't ya?

04:15.856 --> 04:17.392
I was just there, that's all.

04:18.391 --> 04:20.200
Hey, how's Big Cece?

04:21.060 --> 04:23.564
He had this dumb little
accident. He's home, laid up.

04:23.897 --> 04:25.604
Bad?

04:28.735 --> 04:31.682
Noble Flowers, this is Dominic
Santini, Dad's best friend.

04:31.738 --> 04:33.513
How are ya? Glad to meet ya.

04:34.808 --> 04:37.550
Hey, you think you can get
off and take us to him?

04:37.611 --> 04:38.646
I'm on shift.

04:38.712 --> 04:40.919
Oh, that's okay, Carnes. Catch a rabbit.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.720
Tell the boss I've got
everything under control here.

04:44.184 --> 04:46.027
Hey, thanks a lot.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.396
- You're up front with me.
- All right!

05:02.302 --> 05:04.646
Dom tells me your old man made
it all the way through Korea

05:04.704 --> 05:07.446
without so much as a scratch. What happened?

05:09.509 --> 05:11.955
This rack of drill pipe shifted.

05:12.012 --> 05:14.686
Pinned his leg. But he's okay.

05:43.643 --> 05:45.213
Dom Santini.

05:46.379 --> 05:50.191
Danged if you ain't still
as ugly as a mud finch.

05:51.751 --> 05:54.027
You looking pretty good yourself.

05:54.087 --> 05:55.088
For you.

06:04.831 --> 06:06.777
What are you do’n off of the job?

06:07.868 --> 06:09.905
Dom, asked him to show us the way.

06:10.637 --> 06:13.174
Oh, come on, come on,
will ya? Let's go. Come on!

06:13.240 --> 06:16.710
Hey, did you make any of that sip’n whiskey?

06:19.179 --> 06:21.989
Just like Korea, Santini wins again.

06:22.482 --> 06:26.225
You had fresh goat over there, and
all I had was government issue.

06:27.554 --> 06:30.228
Oh, and my special thanks to Little Cece.

06:30.323 --> 06:32.200
Seconds 3 times!

06:34.828 --> 06:37.434
Well, you know, he does eat out
of this kitchen all the time.

06:37.497 --> 06:39.568
It's probably just 'cause
it was someth’n different.

06:39.633 --> 06:40.634
Sure was.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.408
If the boy hated my cook’n that much,

06:44.471 --> 06:47.782
it's a wonder he never took his
turn at the stove, ain't it?

06:49.276 --> 06:51.313
Well, you know I hate to eat and run,

06:51.378 --> 06:54.188
but Cate and I have got a
real early morn’n tomorrow.

06:55.015 --> 06:56.653
Hey, keep in touch now, will ya?

06:56.716 --> 06:58.957
And stay on top of that guy, will ya?

06:59.019 --> 07:01.158
What are you folks do’n here anyhow?

07:01.354 --> 07:03.061
You're stay’n on, Dom.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.500
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:04.557 --> 07:07.504
As a matter of fact, I happen to
have my over-nighter with me.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.605
I'll drive you folks into
town. I'm go’n in anyhow.

07:10.664 --> 07:11.665
Great.

07:11.731 --> 07:13.472
Cecil Junior,

07:13.533 --> 07:17.481
you stay out of that saloon and get
your butt back here before midnight

07:17.537 --> 07:20.711
or I'm gonna kick it so hard,
you'll be wearing it for a collar.

07:26.646 --> 07:29.718
Hell Carnes, you really do
have a way with words.

07:32.352 --> 07:33.353
Much thanks.

07:37.090 --> 07:38.569
Did we come at a bad night?

07:39.159 --> 07:41.867
No. This is the Carnes house.

07:51.571 --> 07:53.141
You know, Cece,

07:54.107 --> 07:56.519
it's funny that we never met before,

07:58.345 --> 08:01.087
'cause you sure do remind me
of somebody I knew once.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.824
Yeah? Who?

08:05.418 --> 08:06.522
Me.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.464
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.

08:11.524 --> 08:13.526
Don't start in on me now.

08:13.593 --> 08:15.573
He's a good kid!

08:17.163 --> 08:20.201
You can have him for 2 cents on the dollar.

08:20.266 --> 08:21.336
But I don't get it!

08:21.401 --> 08:24.473
- The last time I was here, you 2 were…
- Things have changed.

08:25.171 --> 08:27.310
Ever since Evelyn.

08:27.440 --> 08:28.475
Evelyn!

08:28.842 --> 08:31.015
But that was 3 years ago!

08:31.344 --> 08:33.051
You was at the funeral.

08:33.613 --> 08:36.150
You saw how he looked at me.

08:37.417 --> 08:39.624
But it was the shock and everything.

08:39.953 --> 08:41.330
He got over that.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.256
Well, the last time I was here, he…

08:43.323 --> 08:45.826
We was put’n on an act for ya.

08:47.827 --> 08:51.138
It got to where we just
don't bother no more.

08:52.632 --> 08:53.736
Boy.

08:55.869 --> 08:58.042
If Evelyn knew how you 2
were tear’n at each other…

08:58.104 --> 09:00.141
I know! I know.

09:01.307 --> 09:05.187
What can I do when he keeps
look’n at me like I killed her?

09:05.812 --> 09:07.587
Oh, you've got it all wrong.

09:07.647 --> 09:09.285
Oh, the hell I have!

09:11.985 --> 09:13.658
Every time we get into a fight,

09:13.720 --> 09:17.224
it always ends up with him talk’n about her

09:18.124 --> 09:21.037
like she never should've been there at all,

09:21.628 --> 09:24.131
drive’n him to school. It shoulda been me!

09:24.764 --> 09:26.675
But I took off for the rig.

09:32.739 --> 09:36.414
You want to know what hurts the most, Dom?

09:39.946 --> 09:43.951
Not him a-blame’n me for her not be’n here.

09:46.619 --> 09:48.098
It's

09:48.855 --> 09:50.493
her

09:50.957 --> 09:52.595
not be’n here.

09:57.897 --> 10:01.709
I remember how you used to write
her letters every night in Korea.

10:04.337 --> 10:06.817
I just don't understand about Little Cece.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.546
I mean, he's always been such a good kid.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.721
You think so?

10:13.213 --> 10:14.817
Well, if he's such a good boy,

10:14.881 --> 10:17.953
how come he didn't reach
in there and pull her out

10:18.017 --> 10:21.487
instead of hang’n back with
his tail between his legs?

10:21.888 --> 10:24.528
Now, you hold it right there, Cece!

10:25.592 --> 10:27.868
You know it wasn't like that at all!

10:29.129 --> 10:31.439
I talked to the Police the same as you did.

10:31.998 --> 10:34.376
When that drunk ran that light

10:34.434 --> 10:37.711
and rammed her car,
Little Cece was thrown out!

10:38.304 --> 10:40.545
The car went up like a matchbox!

10:41.007 --> 10:43.044
He could not’ve gotten her out!

10:43.510 --> 10:46.081
And the report said she died on impact!

10:49.149 --> 10:52.824
I just hate it when you get
those stubborn streaks!

10:54.954 --> 10:57.594
Did anybody besides me ever tell you

10:57.657 --> 11:01.127
that you're ½ mule and 2/3’s jackass?

11:03.329 --> 11:05.935
Evelyn did all the time.

11:08.968 --> 11:11.312
So don't worry about Little Cece.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.915
Look, it's just a phase
that he's go’n through

11:14.974 --> 11:17.113
just like all kids his age.

11:17.777 --> 11:20.951
He gets a few days of
hard work under his belt,

11:21.014 --> 11:24.052
he'll know how much easier
college is than real life!

11:25.318 --> 11:27.662
Next year, when he goes to A&M,

11:27.720 --> 11:30.223
he'll crack those books. You'll see.

11:31.558 --> 11:34.664
If you're gonna keep tell’n fairy stories,

11:35.461 --> 11:37.338
I think I'll hit the sack.

11:37.931 --> 11:41.140
This ol' leg of mine is ache’n up a storm.

11:42.268 --> 11:44.270
You gonna stay up?

11:45.305 --> 11:49.811
There's a quart of that sip’n
whiskey in that cabinet over yonder,

11:50.743 --> 11:52.780
rassle’n on the cable.

11:55.181 --> 11:57.286
Texas holiday, huh? Ha!

11:57.817 --> 12:00.354
Well, I'll sample some
of that sip’n whiskey,

12:00.653 --> 12:06.160
but on the educational channel,
they've got Rigoletto!

12:10.463 --> 12:13.535
Dom, you never was like regular folks.

12:47.934 --> 12:51.677
I got better things to do than to walk
a mile through snakes and mesquite.

12:51.738 --> 12:53.775
Let's see the goods.

13:04.584 --> 13:05.585
Bueno.

13:09.622 --> 13:12.193
I'll have it to my main
man for testing tomorrow.

13:12.258 --> 13:14.329
When do we get the rest of the 100 keys?

13:14.927 --> 13:17.635
I can't carry 120 pounds on my back.

13:18.264 --> 13:19.800
I have to bring it in by 4-wheel drive.

13:19.866 --> 13:21.277
Well, when do we get it?

13:22.502 --> 13:23.742
Tomorrow afternoon.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.038
6 o'clock.

13:25.705 --> 13:26.945
6 o'clock.

13:32.679 --> 13:34.022
What the hell.

13:57.737 --> 14:00.650
What the hell are you do’n? It's freez’n!

14:02.909 --> 14:07.187
That punk kid of mine
never flunked out of A&M.

14:07.714 --> 14:09.421
He got thrown out!

14:10.516 --> 14:12.518
You wanna know for what?

14:15.388 --> 14:17.459
For sell’n marijuana.

14:19.592 --> 14:22.937
They figured he was sell’n
for somebody on the outside,

14:22.995 --> 14:25.100
but he wouldn't tell 'em noth’n!

14:27.433 --> 14:30.141
The only reason the law wasn't called in,

14:30.203 --> 14:32.114
is 'cause I got friends down there

14:32.171 --> 14:35.243
that didn't want to see the family
name dragged through the mud.

14:36.776 --> 14:40.883
I should've let ‘em throw him
so far back in jail,

14:40.947 --> 14:45.418
they'd have had to shoot him
his beans to him with a 12-gauge!

14:47.987 --> 14:49.466
Oh, Cece.

14:53.025 --> 14:54.800
I'm really sorry.

14:56.529 --> 14:57.530
Well,

14:58.431 --> 15:01.310
I gotta take some of the blame my own self.

15:02.702 --> 15:06.275
I knew he was into someth’n
that he couldn't handle.

15:07.507 --> 15:10.920
But all I done was crack down on him harder.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.482
You know how I am.

15:18.518 --> 15:20.361
He looks up to you, Dom.

15:21.053 --> 15:22.361
Always has.

15:24.323 --> 15:27.304
I want you to see if you can't
straight’n him out for me.

15:28.895 --> 15:30.033
Sure.

15:30.530 --> 15:33.534
But I'm only here for a couple more days.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.840
Take him back to California with ya.

15:36.502 --> 15:38.846
Put him to work. Get him back in school.

15:40.173 --> 15:42.813
And if he gives you one
little bit of trouble,

15:42.875 --> 15:48.018
you got my permission to kick his hind end
clear up betwixt his shoulder blades!

15:53.152 --> 15:55.359
I just can't help it, can I?

15:56.255 --> 15:57.734
You know what I mean.

16:01.227 --> 16:03.730
All right. I'll talk to him.

16:04.197 --> 16:06.438
And I'll tell him how you really feel.

16:06.966 --> 16:10.209
And if it'll do you any good,
I'll stay over a few more days.

16:10.269 --> 16:12.215
But will you do me a favor?

16:12.472 --> 16:14.474
Lay off Little Cece, will ya?

16:16.642 --> 16:20.215
Something I left out. This busted leg…

16:21.147 --> 16:23.650
Little Cece let a rack of pipes slip

16:24.550 --> 16:26.860
and I couldn't get outta the way of it.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.899
Are you tell’n me he did it on purpose?

16:28.955 --> 16:31.697
Oh, no, no, no. No, just butterfingered.

16:32.658 --> 16:35.195
But I was so dang mad, I said he did.

16:37.463 --> 16:39.704
When you talk to him,

16:39.866 --> 16:41.675
tell him I didn't mean that.

16:55.348 --> 16:57.589
You must be Cecil Carnes, Jr.

17:00.086 --> 17:01.326
Don't rub it in.

17:01.387 --> 17:03.333
Flowers said we might find you here.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.103
He needs you tomorrow.

17:08.160 --> 17:10.037
Hey man, I always show up for work.

17:10.096 --> 17:12.576
He wants to make sure
you don't take the day off.

17:14.267 --> 17:15.973
We got a special job.

17:17.369 --> 17:18.371
Delivery.

17:20.205 --> 17:22.550
Sorry, fellas. I'm not in grass anymore.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.278
Neither are we, kid.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.318
We graduated.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.650
It's candy now.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.060
Nose candy.

17:35.588 --> 17:36.692
Count me out.

17:36.989 --> 17:38.900
Flowers said you're in.

17:41.193 --> 17:43.298
And if Flowers said you're in,

17:43.596 --> 17:44.973
you're in.

17:53.439 --> 17:54.747
You wanna fly her?

17:54.807 --> 17:57.310
Didn't the old man tell you
I never soloed before.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.355
I figured he couldn't wait to tell you that.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.823
No, he didn't.

18:01.681 --> 18:04.127
Did you ever figure maybe
you got him all wrong?

18:05.151 --> 18:06.858
All right, you got her.

18:08.688 --> 18:11.066
I'll take over in case you get in too deep.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.409
You know, there is someth’n your Dad told me

18:19.498 --> 18:20.841
about the accident.

18:21.067 --> 18:23.445
Yeah, he said I did it
on purpose, didn't he?

18:24.003 --> 18:26.882
No, he said you were butterfingered.

18:27.273 --> 18:29.776
And he said he was sorry
that he flew off the handle

18:29.842 --> 18:32.220
when he said you did it on purpose.

18:34.213 --> 18:35.817
My old man said he was sorry?

18:36.382 --> 18:38.328
That's a first.

18:38.517 --> 18:40.724
Well, you know, he's hard-headed.

18:41.387 --> 18:42.525
From what I've seen so far,

18:42.588 --> 18:45.125
you're pretty bullheaded yourself, you know.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.494
Hey, watch those birds!

18:57.370 --> 18:58.644
That was pretty good.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.233
Noble, I gotta talk to you.

19:16.288 --> 19:18.894
Later, Carnes. Get over
there and help Moose out.

19:19.058 --> 19:20.128
Mr. Santini?

19:20.192 --> 19:21.796
Hey, if he's late, it's my fault.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.499
No, no, nothing like that.

19:23.562 --> 19:26.133
I was just wondering if you
could do us a big favor.

19:26.232 --> 19:27.370
Sure, what is it?

19:27.433 --> 19:30.607
Well, with Cece being out, it's
really put us in kind of a bind.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.616
He's the only one who flies a chopper.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.379
Well, I'd be glad to help. What is it?

19:34.473 --> 19:38.011
Well, we got some instruments that
really need to go into the shop.

19:38.077 --> 19:40.148
And also, we got test samples.

19:40.212 --> 19:42.749
I thought you could see your
way clear to take 'em on in.

19:42.815 --> 19:45.193
The company will pay your
hours, whatever it is.

19:46.452 --> 19:51.026
You know, I'd be embarrassed to
admit what Santini Air gets,

19:51.157 --> 19:53.501
so I better just do it for noth’n.

19:53.559 --> 19:55.971
- We sure appreciate that, Mr. Santini.
- Sure.

19:56.095 --> 19:57.733
Listen, Carnes can go with you.

19:57.797 --> 20:00.641
He knows where everything's
supposed to go back in town.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.681
And I'll give him the
rest of the day off after.

20:03.803 --> 20:05.214
Hey, that's great!

20:05.271 --> 20:08.741
Listen, why don't you grab
yourself a cup of coffee.

20:08.941 --> 20:11.251
- I'll get the boy organized.
- I'll do that.

20:11.310 --> 20:12.653
- Thanks.
- You bet.

20:15.715 --> 20:18.161
Noble, what you mean put’n
those goons on me last night?

20:18.217 --> 20:19.560
Shut up and listen.

20:20.019 --> 20:22.363
We got in some high-grade sample last night.

20:22.421 --> 20:25.061
It has to go in pronto. Alvin tell you?

20:25.124 --> 20:27.604
Yeah, he tried to but I wasn't listen’n.

20:27.793 --> 20:30.273
All you have to do is drop it off.

20:30.463 --> 20:32.807
And you're in for a full cut.

20:32.865 --> 20:35.277
Yeah, like with the grass? No, thanks.

20:35.401 --> 20:37.472
I'm not look’n for thanks.

20:37.570 --> 20:39.777
Santini's gonna fly you in.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.375
I don't believe that.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.477
He'll never know what he's carrying.

20:43.809 --> 20:45.516
It'll be mixed in with the other drops.

20:45.578 --> 20:48.024
All you have to do is follow the checklist

20:48.080 --> 20:51.061
and make sure you hand
Alvin the right package.

20:51.217 --> 20:53.925
There's no way in hell I'm
gonna be mess’n with cocaine,

20:53.986 --> 20:55.226
or let Uncle Dom.

20:55.287 --> 20:57.096
You don't go along,

20:57.223 --> 20:59.260
Alvin's not gonna like it.

20:59.992 --> 21:03.565
There's noth’n he and Carlos
like better than hurt’n folks.

21:04.029 --> 21:06.635
And hey, I don't wanna see
either one of you get hurt.

21:07.066 --> 21:08.409
Either one of us?

21:08.501 --> 21:10.879
You or your Daddy.

21:12.905 --> 21:14.441
You are scum.

21:34.894 --> 21:37.738
So what are you gonna do
on your unexpected day off?

21:39.331 --> 21:41.004
Ah, you got a girl.

21:41.700 --> 21:42.770
Had a girl.

21:42.868 --> 21:44.472
She didn't like my hours.

21:49.642 --> 21:51.986
So why don't you take me fishing?

21:52.044 --> 21:53.853
Maybe your Pop will come too.

21:55.181 --> 21:56.558
Not if I was along.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.195
Watch out! Piper at 6 o'clock!

22:03.289 --> 22:04.734
What the hell's going on?

22:05.991 --> 22:09.063
Careful, Cece. The package is
jammed between the rudders.

22:09.562 --> 22:11.906
Hold her steady, hold her steady.

22:14.900 --> 22:16.004
What is this?

22:38.257 --> 22:39.327
Damn.

22:39.491 --> 22:41.869
Oh, Cecil, how could you be so stupid?

22:42.795 --> 22:44.468
Who else was in this? Flowers?

22:46.498 --> 22:48.842
Keep’n quiet's not gonna get you anywhere.

22:49.435 --> 22:52.473
You'd be a lot better off if you
give me someth’n to work with.

22:52.538 --> 22:54.313
Now, where was this stuff go’n?

22:55.107 --> 22:57.109
Where is the next stop on your list?

22:59.211 --> 23:02.124
I'm gonna find out where
this poison goes to and why.

23:02.181 --> 23:03.592
And without your help.

23:04.083 --> 23:05.892
Uncle Dom, I know I screwed up bad,

23:06.652 --> 23:08.029
but I just can't rat on ‘em!

23:08.087 --> 23:09.794
Rats on your not ratting!

23:10.055 --> 23:12.035
And don't call me Uncle Dom!

23:12.591 --> 23:14.434
I'll find it without ya.

23:24.904 --> 23:28.317
When the punk gets here, how 'bout I
bust something for being late, huh?

23:29.742 --> 23:31.585
If he gets here.

23:32.478 --> 23:33.957
I'm calling Flowers.

23:45.124 --> 23:47.126
Uncle Dom, the big guy carries a gun.

23:48.060 --> 23:50.904
When we set down, you don't open
your mouth, you understand?

24:06.545 --> 24:07.683
Who are you?

24:07.846 --> 24:10.554
I'm sorry, but I don't
do business with strangers.

24:10.616 --> 24:11.959
Show me some ID.

24:12.217 --> 24:13.719
Who is this joker?

24:13.786 --> 24:15.197
You want the goods,

24:15.254 --> 24:16.756
you gotta show me something.

24:23.495 --> 24:24.803
That's me, all right?

24:26.966 --> 24:28.240
That's you, all right.

24:38.610 --> 24:41.022
Who's Alvin Brock? And the other goon?

24:41.080 --> 24:42.150
I don't know.

24:42.815 --> 24:43.953
Honest.

24:44.216 --> 24:46.321
They just came up to me at the Shy Texan.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.628
Do you expect me to believe that?

24:50.255 --> 24:51.256
No.

24:51.957 --> 24:53.595
You are just like him.

24:55.094 --> 24:57.335
I suppose you're gonna
turn me in now, right?

24:57.763 --> 25:00.471
Can you give me 3 good
reasons why I shouldn't?

25:03.102 --> 25:04.843
But don't worry. I'm gonna
get you some company.

25:04.903 --> 25:06.974
You're not gonna take this rap alone.

25:07.439 --> 25:09.680
And yes, I am just like him.

25:10.209 --> 25:13.418
Because neither one of us want
to see you ruin your life.

25:24.923 --> 25:25.993
Hello.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.735
What's going on, Flowers?

25:27.793 --> 25:29.363
Your couriers just took off with my stuff.

25:29.428 --> 25:30.463
What?

25:30.529 --> 25:32.065
It's not my do’n Alvin, I swear.

25:32.197 --> 25:33.972
I know you wouldn't be that stupid.

25:35.267 --> 25:37.508
I figure they're either go’n
into business for their selves,

25:37.569 --> 25:39.276
or they're go’n to the cops.

25:39.338 --> 25:40.578
Well, what do we do?

25:40.639 --> 25:42.346
Listen, and get this right.

25:42.408 --> 25:44.410
Carlos and me are go’n after your people.

25:44.476 --> 25:45.955
If we get 'em, I'll call ya.

25:46.011 --> 25:49.049
If you don't hear from me, you'll
have to meet the Mule yourself.

25:49.114 --> 25:50.559
Tell him the heat's on.

25:50.649 --> 25:53.391
I understand. I'll take care of it.

25:56.622 --> 25:57.999
What's happen’n?

25:58.924 --> 25:59.994
Well Moose,

26:01.360 --> 26:03.306
we may be go’n to do some travel’n.

26:08.367 --> 26:09.778
That's my house.

26:10.936 --> 26:14.281
Oh, you couldn't wait to give the
old man his crack at me, could you?

26:14.573 --> 26:17.179
For your information, we're
getting your Pop outta there

26:17.242 --> 26:18.880
until I decide what to do.

26:19.011 --> 26:21.355
It'll be the first place
your buddies will look.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.256
They're not my buddies!

26:35.761 --> 26:37.968
Cece, get some things together and come on!

26:38.030 --> 26:40.340
- What? What's happen’n?
- I'll explain later.

26:44.636 --> 26:46.013
Bingo!

26:51.243 --> 26:52.586
They're coming!

26:55.047 --> 26:56.253
Big Cece!

26:56.849 --> 26:59.352
Oh, wait a minute, I forgot someth’n!

27:01.587 --> 27:03.794
Come on, Big Cece! Hurry up!

27:11.130 --> 27:12.404
Hurry up!

27:17.402 --> 27:19.609
Here. Come on, get up there!

27:47.232 --> 27:51.772
I'm almost glad your Mama ain't here
to see what you're mixed up in.

27:53.605 --> 27:54.948
You happy now?

27:56.008 --> 27:57.817
I finally proved I ain't any good.

27:57.876 --> 27:59.856
Oh, shut up, both of ya!

28:00.979 --> 28:03.721
Now, is there any more stuff
back there at the refinery?

28:04.983 --> 28:07.088
- Answer him!
- I said shut up!

28:07.886 --> 28:11.265
I don't have to take that
off of you or nobody else.

28:24.770 --> 28:26.113
Look son,

28:26.405 --> 28:28.578
I'm not ask’n you to name names.

28:29.975 --> 28:33.548
But if there are any more drugs out
there that you haven't told me about,

28:34.012 --> 28:37.152
the Police will get it out
of you. Don't you understand?

29:09.815 --> 29:11.089
I checked all 3 motels.

29:11.149 --> 29:12.787
Nobody there with a broken leg.

29:13.385 --> 29:15.888
There's only one other place they could be.

29:38.343 --> 29:39.617
Read this.

29:41.513 --> 29:42.719
Out loud.

29:43.915 --> 29:45.121
“Dearest Evelyn,”

29:45.784 --> 29:47.764
“can't wait till this here job is over”

29:47.819 --> 29:49.992
“so I could see you and my little guy.”

29:50.756 --> 29:54.135
“It's the second best thing I
ever did, next to marrying you.”

29:55.661 --> 29:57.641
Things sure have changed, haven't they?

29:58.397 --> 29:59.740
Now read this.

30:01.266 --> 30:03.177
It's just last week.

30:08.006 --> 30:10.316
“Sorry I missed my visit yesterday.”

30:10.742 --> 30:12.983
“I had this fool accident
and I broke my leg.”

30:14.212 --> 30:15.885
“But I'm do’n fine now.”

30:17.616 --> 30:20.597
“Cecil Junior is doing
real good out at the refinery.”

30:22.354 --> 30:23.958
“I’m proud of him.”

30:26.058 --> 30:27.833
“You would be, too.”

30:29.995 --> 30:32.475
“Now, he's gone through a bad spell”

30:32.764 --> 30:34.402
“but he'll be okay.”

30:35.367 --> 30:39.315
“We both know when you
come right down to it,”

30:40.972 --> 30:43.179
“he's the best kid in the world.”

30:45.577 --> 30:47.056
What's the matter?

30:47.546 --> 30:49.048
Swallow a bug?

30:57.489 --> 30:59.400
You still got noth’n to say to me?

31:02.761 --> 31:06.265
Flowers said someth’n about the real
shipment coming in this afternoon.

31:06.365 --> 31:07.400
Where?

31:07.733 --> 31:09.041
I don't know.

31:09.301 --> 31:10.974
Probably the oil field.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.945
String? It's Dom. Do you copy, String?

31:18.944 --> 31:20.321
String, are you there?

31:20.445 --> 31:21.822
I got ya, Dom. Go ahead.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.486
String, we need the Lady.

31:25.851 --> 31:27.387
Dom, I think it should be later on tonight.

31:27.819 --> 31:29.457
Tonight's not good enough!

31:29.721 --> 31:33.464
Look! Meet me at that refinery as
soon as you get her buttoned up.

31:40.031 --> 31:41.408
I'm go’n with ya.

31:41.700 --> 31:42.906
With a busted leg?

31:44.970 --> 31:49.248
There ain't nobody else here in this
room that's man enough to help.

31:59.384 --> 32:01.193
It's all over for him, ain't it?

32:02.954 --> 32:05.491
He asked for it. Serves him right.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.563
I don't believe you mean that.

32:09.494 --> 32:10.598
Now look,

32:10.662 --> 32:13.233
if we can nip that shipment
before it gets into town,

32:13.298 --> 32:16.643
maybe, just maybe, we can get
Little Cece a separate deal

32:16.701 --> 32:18.681
than that scum who used him.

32:20.071 --> 32:23.143
How do you tell him
from the rest of the scum?

32:23.608 --> 32:27.681
Oh, come on, will ya? We're
waste’n time. Let's get move’n.

32:27.813 --> 32:29.383
You're leave’n him here?

32:29.448 --> 32:31.257
Ain't you afraid he's gonna duck out on us?

32:31.316 --> 32:33.353
No, he's coming with us.

32:33.418 --> 32:35.022
Little Cece!

32:35.120 --> 32:36.326
Little Cece!

32:36.588 --> 32:37.692
What the…

32:50.735 --> 32:51.839
Nobody.

33:01.613 --> 33:03.286
Where's the stuff?

33:13.592 --> 33:15.265
Where's the kid?

33:18.463 --> 33:20.204
He got my goods with him?

33:22.567 --> 33:25.810
Oh, was that your box?
I'll get it for you.

33:27.839 --> 33:32.447
Kinda reminds me of that time at
the Golden Dragon Bar in Yonchon,

33:32.511 --> 33:34.218
don't it you, Dom.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.458
Hop! Hope! Heep!

33:46.324 --> 33:48.361
- Did you hear from Alvin?
- Nope.

33:48.426 --> 33:50.303
We're take’n off with the Mule.

33:52.631 --> 33:54.110
Good.

33:54.165 --> 33:55.769
The day shift's finished.

33:57.335 --> 34:01.010
We're gonna give ‘em something
to take their mind off of us.

34:11.483 --> 34:13.053
We found your letters.

34:15.554 --> 34:16.589
So?

34:17.455 --> 34:18.956
He read them, too.

34:19.357 --> 34:21.063
Well, you didn't have no right…

34:21.126 --> 34:23.629
If you had said some of the things to
him that you wrote in those letters,

34:23.695 --> 34:25.606
maybe he'd have turned out different.

34:27.831 --> 34:30.176
So now it's all of my do’ns, huh?

34:30.502 --> 34:32.038
I didn't say that.

34:33.237 --> 34:36.844
But you don't exactly come off
smell’n like a rose, either.

34:44.482 --> 34:46.655
By the time she blows, we'll be on our way.

34:46.751 --> 34:48.094
What about that dynamite?

34:48.152 --> 34:49.188
Is it gonna go, too?

34:49.254 --> 34:51.029
Who knows, who cares.

34:56.261 --> 34:57.262
Hey.

34:57.629 --> 34:59.131
That's Big Cece's chopper.

35:00.765 --> 35:02.301
Let's get outta here.

35:23.154 --> 35:24.861
You're coming with me, both
of you. Get in the chopper!

35:24.923 --> 35:27.631
Now, you're make’n a big mistake, son.

35:27.692 --> 35:30.639
Let's take it easy. Simmer
down, let's talk it over.

35:30.695 --> 35:32.436
No, now! Come on, let's go!

35:34.766 --> 35:37.337
Better get him inside
before somebody sees us.

35:55.320 --> 35:57.231
The rig's on fire!

36:19.744 --> 36:22.816
Get on that derrick, and try
shutting down the capping line!

36:22.881 --> 36:24.827
That oughta get their minds off us.

36:30.221 --> 36:31.529
My God! The rig!

36:46.604 --> 36:47.776
String, do you hear me?

36:47.839 --> 36:50.615
May Day, May Day! We got a fire on the site!

36:53.078 --> 36:54.751
That's my bird down there.

36:54.813 --> 36:56.486
You spot Cecil Junior anywhere?

36:56.548 --> 36:57.549
No.

36:57.649 --> 36:59.492
Well, come on! Get me down there!

37:08.460 --> 37:09.564
Get back!

37:10.128 --> 37:11.402
It's gonna blow!

37:14.899 --> 37:16.105
Come on!

37:26.945 --> 37:29.221
Somebody hand me a shovel!

37:30.448 --> 37:31.722
Where is my boy?

37:31.783 --> 37:32.853
What happened?

37:32.951 --> 37:35.363
It went off like a bomb!
I ain't seen Little Cece!

37:35.420 --> 37:37.127
Dom! Go find Little Cece!

37:37.188 --> 37:39.429
All right, shovel! Shovel hard, men!

37:40.158 --> 37:43.105
It's like shoveling
some sand against the tide.

37:43.161 --> 37:44.401
All right, keep shoveling!

37:44.462 --> 37:46.908
Can't let the fire get
to that dynamite shack!

37:48.333 --> 37:50.540
Keep shoveling! You heard Carnes!

38:07.819 --> 38:08.923
Cece!

38:11.289 --> 38:12.734
Are you all right?

38:12.791 --> 38:15.397
Flowers and Moose took off
with someone in a 4-by!

38:15.560 --> 38:17.767
You gotta stop ‘em! They set the fire!

38:17.829 --> 38:19.365
Let's go! Come on!

38:20.665 --> 38:22.975
Get away from that dynamite shack!

38:27.272 --> 38:29.013
Stay with your Dad!

38:36.447 --> 38:38.654
Keep the fire away from that dynamite!

38:39.517 --> 38:41.895
String! String, do you receive me?

38:42.153 --> 38:43.325
We're airborne.

38:43.388 --> 38:46.858
Oh, String! That fires spreading
fast! We need you, boy!

38:47.058 --> 38:49.334
Hang on Dom, we'll be there.

38:55.433 --> 38:59.438
All right, everybody. Move out.
Hurry up. That dynamite's gonna go!

38:59.504 --> 39:02.007
Everybody back! There's
noth’n we can do now!

39:07.545 --> 39:09.286
Pops, where are you go’n?

39:17.488 --> 39:19.627
Are you crazy? Get out of there, Pop!

39:19.891 --> 39:22.303
Cece! Cece!

39:22.927 --> 39:24.031
Cece!

39:25.463 --> 39:28.467
Pops, No! The dynamite's gonna blow!

39:35.607 --> 39:36.915
- Cece!
- Pop!

39:36.975 --> 39:38.750
- Cece!
- Pop! You all right?

39:39.978 --> 39:43.221
Damn! I think I just broke my good leg.

39:44.482 --> 39:46.723
Oh God. All right, let's get him outta here.

39:51.789 --> 39:54.065
Here we go! Up! Come on!

39:54.826 --> 39:57.397
- Come on, let's get outta here!
- Watch out!

40:11.142 --> 40:13.645
Son, we don't get that fire out,

40:13.711 --> 40:15.452
the whole refinery's gonna go.

40:17.482 --> 40:19.155
I'm gonna put out that fire.

40:19.684 --> 40:22.597
Come on, you guys!
Give me a hand! Hurry up!

40:23.154 --> 40:26.431
Come on, dig! We gotta put this thing out!

40:26.491 --> 40:30.564
You see how my boy just flat took charge?

40:30.662 --> 40:32.733
Come on, get over here! Come on!

40:32.797 --> 40:35.107
You gotta control it!
I need your help! Move it!

40:35.166 --> 40:37.305
Come on, keep shovel’n!

40:42.674 --> 40:43.914
Spill! Fire!

40:53.785 --> 40:55.389
It ain't gonna work, Dom.

40:55.453 --> 40:56.796
They can't get it out.

40:56.854 --> 40:59.960
Everybody pull back!
Come on! Get outta here!

41:01.025 --> 41:02.561
Everybody pull back!

41:09.367 --> 41:11.779
Listen, give me a hand and put him in here.

41:19.610 --> 41:20.680
Hey, look!

41:22.447 --> 41:24.290
Let's take a closer look.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.100
Dom, I've got the fire power.

41:36.160 --> 41:37.833
We'll just dig a trench and divert it.

41:40.732 --> 41:43.008
Sequential firing locked and ready.

41:43.901 --> 41:44.936
Let's do it.

42:17.468 --> 42:19.175
All right! Whoo!

42:32.784 --> 42:35.162
The fire, it's stopping at the trench!

42:36.287 --> 42:38.267
All right!

42:40.425 --> 42:42.132
Okay! All right!

42:42.193 --> 42:44.264
He did it! He did it!

42:48.699 --> 42:51.236
String! String, nice shooting!

42:51.335 --> 42:55.477
Listen, Flowers and Moose set
that fire to cover their escape!

42:56.307 --> 42:59.254
Now, if I were them,
I'd be head’n for the border.

42:59.377 --> 43:00.412
You understand?

43:00.478 --> 43:01.513
Roger, Dom.

43:01.579 --> 43:03.684
We'll see if we can't change those plans.

43:37.415 --> 43:38.985
Hawke, I've got something.

43:40.284 --> 43:42.230
A 4-wheel-drive vehicle but it stopped.

43:42.286 --> 43:43.492
Nobody's around.

43:43.855 --> 43:45.562
Sounds like they made a switch.

43:45.623 --> 43:47.762
Checking. Nothing on the ground.

43:48.793 --> 43:49.863
Hold it!

43:50.261 --> 43:52.764
There it is! It's a
helicopter headed due South.

43:53.331 --> 43:54.366
On our way.

44:00.671 --> 44:03.982
Mexico is a great country
Moose, if you get a few bucks.

44:11.349 --> 44:13.226
We're take’n you in, Flowers.

44:13.284 --> 44:15.491
Tell the pilot to land that ship, now!

44:17.121 --> 44:20.762
If you don't want to rot in jail,
I suggest you take him down.

44:51.956 --> 44:53.629
Give me a hellfire, Cate.

44:53.691 --> 44:54.897
Hellfire ready!

45:14.045 --> 45:17.618
I got me a letter from the
Railroad Commissioner of Texas,

45:17.682 --> 45:20.856
and a get-well card
from the Lieutenant-Governor.

45:22.119 --> 45:26.158
And ‘ol Red Adair sent me this his own self.

45:28.159 --> 45:29.297
All right!

45:30.628 --> 45:32.801
And I don't know what all's in here.

45:33.097 --> 45:35.976
Incidentally, your Pops says
you can come live with me

45:36.033 --> 45:37.808
and go to college in Los Angeles.

45:37.868 --> 45:39.245
Los Angeles!

45:39.303 --> 45:43.479
The Prosecutor tells me that he's willing
to let you do your probation in California.

45:46.043 --> 45:48.649
I bet you could even get a part
time job with Santini Air.

45:48.713 --> 45:52.661
Oh, no. No, he ain't go’n to no California.

45:53.784 --> 45:57.322
He's stay’n right here in Texas, with me.

45:57.521 --> 45:59.000
We got our own schools

45:59.056 --> 46:01.730
and if he wants to take up fly’n again,

46:01.792 --> 46:04.932
you tell me a better teacher
than this old man.
