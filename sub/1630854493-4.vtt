WEBVTT

00:05.533 --> 00:07.834
Bear. Bear. Bear.

00:07.834 --> 00:09.634
What ya doin', buddy?

00:09.634 --> 00:11.266
Oh, you don't wanna play.

00:12.367 --> 00:14.800
Bears these days,
just don't wanna play anymore.

00:15.867 --> 00:19.800
Goin' up to do a surprise
check-up on Kayla's crew

00:19.800 --> 00:21.367
at Mark Siethen's place.

00:21.367 --> 00:22.934
Got a lot on my plate.

00:23.900 --> 00:25.967
Got more to do
than I have time.

00:27.533 --> 00:29.800
In remote Southeast Alaska,

00:29.800 --> 00:33.100
Dustin Hurt has spent every
last cent of his savings

00:33.100 --> 00:35.700
on his new claim at
Nugget Creek

00:35.700 --> 00:39.300
and is counting on Kayla's
crew at Porcupine Creek

00:39.300 --> 00:42.400
to help bankroll
the entire operation.

00:42.400 --> 00:43.867
How's it goin'?

00:43.867 --> 00:47.200
Pretty good. We're starting
to get all the little quirks
worked out.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.934
- That is some dirty water
you got there.
- It's awful.

00:49.934 --> 00:53.533
So, thought y'all
were gonna kick
the tailings over the road.

00:53.533 --> 00:56.567
I mean, the water's gonna
be that color regardless.

00:56.567 --> 00:59.467
Well, that's--
Look at the difference.

01:03.300 --> 01:06.133
Paul Richardson is
three hours into his dive

01:06.133 --> 01:08.166
and dredging blind.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.367
Mind if I talk to him
for a sec?

01:12.367 --> 01:13.367
Yeah.

01:13.367 --> 01:15.166
Hey, Paul. How ya doin', man?

01:15.166 --> 01:16.700
Not good.

01:16.700 --> 01:19.967
- So what's the diggin' like?
- Can't see [bleep].

01:23.066 --> 01:25.100
Yeah, I'm about ready
to call my dive.

01:41.467 --> 01:43.634
Here's one piece
right there.

01:43.634 --> 01:45.400
It's not-- It's just a flake.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.100
Like 10 cents worth of gold,

01:47.600 --> 01:48.934
if that.

01:48.934 --> 01:50.900
That's a lot of
work for nothin'.

01:50.900 --> 01:52.233
That really [bleep] sucks.

01:57.333 --> 01:59.300
I might be
changing some things up here.

02:00.433 --> 02:02.767
Might piss a lot of
people off. It's okay.

02:03.867 --> 02:05.400
I'm okay with
pissing people off.

02:07.767 --> 02:09.867
I don't like the way
things are being done.

02:09.867 --> 02:11.400
I got some different ideas.

02:12.934 --> 02:14.200
It's just a [bleep] show.

02:17.300 --> 02:21.133
Kayla and Justin,
I'ma need you guys to
come up with me to camp

02:21.133 --> 02:22.734
and scout out your new place.

02:22.734 --> 02:24.300
We need to know
where y'all are diggin'.

02:26.166 --> 02:28.000
Scott and Paul,

02:28.000 --> 02:30.567
you're gonna stay here
and dredge.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.600
It's a lot of damn work, man.

02:33.934 --> 02:35.667
I think we need somebody
with experience.

02:38.867 --> 02:41.667
You're not gonna like what
he has to say about anything,

02:41.667 --> 02:44.367
but I would like Fred
to be here.

02:52.433 --> 02:54.900
What the hell y'all
got goin' here?

02:54.900 --> 02:56.500
Three, two, one!

02:56.500 --> 02:57.634
Watch out!

02:57.634 --> 02:59.200
You almost died.

03:01.100 --> 03:02.667
Nobody fall
over the edge.

03:06.266 --> 03:08.300
I only have two rules.
Don't get hurt.

03:08.300 --> 03:09.233
And don't die.

03:10.467 --> 03:12.634
Holy moly!

03:12.634 --> 03:14.333
My wife would kill me.

03:17.500 --> 03:20.734
- Is that...
- yeah, dude!

03:20.734 --> 03:23.266
The fact that every pan had
a little bit of gold in it

03:23.266 --> 03:24.600
was a really good sign.

03:24.600 --> 03:27.166
- There you go, Scott.
- Whoo!

03:27.166 --> 03:28.834
That's nice.

03:38.600 --> 03:42.300
Bring as much as you can,
'cause we're gonna need
at least two jugs.

03:42.300 --> 03:44.767
If you flip it over, it'll
carry real easy, I think.

03:47.367 --> 03:50.133
Nine miles
up the Tsirku River,

03:50.133 --> 03:52.266
deep in the
Alaskan wilderness,

03:52.266 --> 03:56.133
mine boss Dustin Hurt is
a month into the mining season

03:56.133 --> 03:59.333
on his new Nugget Creek claim.

03:59.333 --> 04:01.934
It's just costing
a lot of money,
'cause we're way out here.

04:01.934 --> 04:04.634
So we need to get in the water
and we need to find some gold.

04:04.634 --> 04:06.200
That has to happen.

04:06.200 --> 04:09.500
We're gonna go up there.
I need to make a
parking spot for the dredge.

04:09.500 --> 04:10.967
That's my goal today.

04:10.967 --> 04:14.333
I need us in the water,
or this is costing too much.

04:14.333 --> 04:17.066
And we need to start getting
gold in the pocket.

04:17.066 --> 04:19.500
That's all there is to it.
It has to pay for itself.

04:21.567 --> 04:27.000
Last week,
with a little help from
mining legend, Fred Hurt,

04:27.000 --> 04:29.734
Dustin finally punched
through the ice barrier,

04:29.734 --> 04:33.500
blocking the path to
his Golden Gates dive site.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.767
Hey! Holy crap.

04:36.400 --> 04:38.233
You've got some gold, man!

04:40.567 --> 04:43.767
Now, with his new
dive site free of ice,

04:43.767 --> 04:46.233
Dustin is about to
double down.

04:46.233 --> 04:47.667
Go look for your new site.

04:47.667 --> 04:49.266
I would suggest
bringing a rope.

04:49.266 --> 04:50.567
Wear some harnesses.

04:50.567 --> 04:53.033
Not that you don't know
what you're doing,
but slips happen.

04:53.033 --> 04:54.433
We all slip.

04:54.433 --> 04:56.634
- All right, everybody know
what to do? All right.
- Yup.

04:56.634 --> 04:58.266
- It's time to hit it.
- Let's get to it.

05:01.934 --> 05:05.800
500 feet up-creek is the start
of Dustin's claims.

05:07.433 --> 05:10.767
And it's here that Fred
found their first gold,

05:10.767 --> 05:13.233
dubbing the area
"the Golden Gates."

05:15.200 --> 05:16.700
I'm excited
about this area.

05:16.700 --> 05:18.333
Look at those boulders.

05:18.333 --> 05:20.100
There's gonna be a line
of gold right through here

05:20.100 --> 05:23.500
because this has not
been touched. Any of this.

05:23.500 --> 05:25.834
The virgin ground
looks promising.

05:25.834 --> 05:27.967
But it will take a diver
in the water

05:27.967 --> 05:30.734
to see how much gold
lies beneath.

05:30.734 --> 05:32.500
You wanna put the dredge
right here?

05:33.133 --> 05:34.600
We haven't decided yet.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.800
Now, this seems like
a lot of extra work,

05:36.800 --> 05:39.066
but I wanted
to make a dam.

05:40.233 --> 05:43.100
All the way across and
make that water level match.

05:43.100 --> 05:45.800
It'll slow that water down
where we're at.

05:46.900 --> 05:48.133
With that boulder
out of the way,

05:48.133 --> 05:49.900
it'll give me a parking spot

05:50.800 --> 05:52.700
so I can put
the damn dredge in,

05:53.333 --> 05:54.667
back in a boat

05:54.667 --> 05:57.166
about three or four feet
behind this big rock.

05:57.166 --> 05:58.934
That big rock gone,

05:58.934 --> 06:01.166
that would be my
perfect world right there.

06:01.166 --> 06:03.800
That would be an
awesome world right there.

06:05.433 --> 06:07.634
To get the dredge
in the water,

06:07.634 --> 06:11.166
Dustin must first move
monster boulders downstream

06:11.166 --> 06:14.000
to create a dam.

06:14.000 --> 06:18.100
This will raise
the water level and
slow the raging current,

06:18.100 --> 06:21.567
creating a perfect spot
to float the dredge

06:21.567 --> 06:26.133
and dive for what Dustin
believes is an
untouched deposit of gold.

06:27.634 --> 06:29.533
All right, guys.
Let's pop some rocks.

06:29.533 --> 06:32.367
Let's get this dam up.
I need this dredge
in the water.

06:32.367 --> 06:33.266
We got to get to diggin'.

06:33.266 --> 06:34.533
Let's get a diver
in the water, man.

06:34.533 --> 06:35.500
Let's go.

06:44.333 --> 06:47.000
So this gives you
an idea of what we're
dealing with with the water.

06:47.000 --> 06:51.100
This creek drops, I think,
900 feet per mile.

06:52.266 --> 06:54.200
So it's gonna be fast water.

06:55.000 --> 06:56.166
No kidding.

06:58.033 --> 07:02.133
Kayla, there's a really
hard hike going
all the way up-creek.

07:02.133 --> 07:04.033
You guys got your work
cut out for you.

07:04.033 --> 07:08.166
I've only seen ice and snow
as far as I've been up, so.

07:08.166 --> 07:09.533
We need to get
an aerial view

07:09.533 --> 07:13.166
so we can find somewhere
that's more exposed,
less snow.

07:13.166 --> 07:14.467
What I was
thinking for you

07:15.533 --> 07:17.233
was to continue right here.

07:17.233 --> 07:19.000
That's what we
were looking at.

07:19.000 --> 07:21.800
That's a marathon
right there.
That's not a sprint.

07:24.600 --> 07:25.600
Let's go!

07:25.600 --> 07:27.266
On the hunt
for a dive site,

07:27.266 --> 07:30.233
Kayla and Justin are forced
to blaze their own trail

07:30.233 --> 07:32.233
up the sheer cliffs

07:32.233 --> 07:34.600
and into
the untamed wilderness.

07:34.600 --> 07:36.066
Wait up for me, speedy.

07:36.066 --> 07:38.100
- Hurry up.
- I'm hurrying.

07:38.100 --> 07:39.667
- Don't die.
- I won't.

07:40.967 --> 07:44.467
I can put a little
extra weight in mine
if needed.

07:44.467 --> 07:46.533
The weight I need
to lose, you can't take.

07:47.166 --> 07:48.700
Nope.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.200
I got some bear doo-doo.

07:54.200 --> 07:57.033
Yeah. I don't have
a gun either.

07:57.033 --> 08:00.300
If we get up
to a ledge that opens up
to where we can walk along it,

08:00.300 --> 08:03.634
we might be able to walk
upstream to get a better view.

08:03.634 --> 08:05.166
So hopefully
not too far.

08:05.166 --> 08:06.467
Hopefully.

08:11.500 --> 08:13.500
Nine miles north,

08:13.500 --> 08:16.667
79-year-old mining legend,
Fred Hurt,

08:16.667 --> 08:19.800
returns to Porcupine Creek,

08:19.800 --> 08:23.033
the same creek where
he and Dusting first
started their adventure.

08:24.967 --> 08:26.700
19 years of memories.

08:27.400 --> 08:28.967
Good old Porcupine Creek mine.

08:30.467 --> 08:32.000
Over a decade ago...

08:32.000 --> 08:34.800
We know there's gold
sitting under our feet.

08:34.800 --> 08:38.266
...Fred gambled on the legend
of the glory hole

08:38.266 --> 08:42.533
and chased an ancient
waterfall over 100 feet deep.

08:42.533 --> 08:44.033
The material is
just too hard.

08:44.033 --> 08:47.266
This thing doesn't have
enough power to continue.

08:47.266 --> 08:49.634
They never reached
the bedrock bottom...

08:49.634 --> 08:51.734
Declaring it right now abandoned.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.533
...but still got to
their biggest payday.

08:59.533 --> 09:00.900
We took about
three quarters of

09:00.900 --> 09:03.967
a million dollars' worth
of gold out of this hole.

09:03.967 --> 09:05.433
Did I have fun doin' it?

09:06.500 --> 09:08.233
Hell yes, I did.

09:09.734 --> 09:13.734
Now he's heading
a mile up Porcupine Creek

09:13.734 --> 09:17.300
to take over the
dredging operation at
Mark Siethen's claim.

09:21.433 --> 09:25.800
There does seem
to be a considerable
amount of problems.

09:25.800 --> 09:29.600
I probably have a little more
irritating way of dealing
with it than Dustin.

09:30.567 --> 09:31.800
As I'm getting a little older,

09:31.800 --> 09:34.400
I'm trying to be
a little more tactful.

09:35.433 --> 09:36.700
Just a little.

09:41.800 --> 09:44.000
- How's it going, Fred?
- Hey hey!

09:44.000 --> 09:45.500
Hey, Fred.
How ya doing, man?

09:45.500 --> 09:46.500
Good to see you, buddy.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.200
Welcome back out
to Porcupine.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.533
- Hot damn!
- How ya been doin'?

09:50.533 --> 09:52.567
They just sucking down diesel.

09:52.567 --> 09:53.533
Oh, yeah.

09:54.500 --> 09:57.100
On this spot
a century ago,

09:57.100 --> 10:00.200
the early minors built
a huge wooden flume

10:00.200 --> 10:02.133
to divert Porcupine Creek

10:02.133 --> 10:07.300
and mine the riverbed for
millions of dollars of gold.

10:07.300 --> 10:11.767
Mark believes the remains
of the pilings
that supported the flume

10:11.767 --> 10:15.767
prove that the ground
by the side of the creek
was never mined,

10:16.800 --> 10:20.233
leaving behind a
treasure trove of gold.

10:23.300 --> 10:25.900
But, boy, y'all do
have a nasty mess here.

10:26.734 --> 10:29.133
Well, we got a cesspool.

10:30.333 --> 10:32.100
Oh, Lord!

10:32.100 --> 10:34.700
It's so murky that
we can't see anything,

10:34.700 --> 10:36.266
so we can't really make
good progress.

10:36.266 --> 10:38.433
We end up spending more time
taking our plug-ups out.

10:40.934 --> 10:42.300
The way they have it
set up now

10:42.300 --> 10:45.033
is just an
impossible situation.

10:45.033 --> 10:48.266
They're dumping dirty water
into the water
they're diving in.

10:49.967 --> 10:52.200
Duh.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.200
It'll settle down
if we let it alone
for a couple of days.

10:54.200 --> 10:55.634
It'll settle down and
we'll have some clarity.

10:55.634 --> 10:57.834
But as soon as we
fire the dredge up,

10:57.834 --> 10:59.934
poof, it's all
back to this again.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.667
I would put two of 'em.

11:08.667 --> 11:10.233
Make two ponds out of one.

11:11.133 --> 11:12.934
- Two ponds?
- I would.

11:14.166 --> 11:15.767
I'd rather spend
the half a day,

11:15.767 --> 11:17.634
divide the pond in two parts

11:17.634 --> 11:20.000
so we can see
what we're doin'.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.567
We're gonna split this
and make
two ponds out of this.

11:22.567 --> 11:26.433
And then we're gonna go ahead
and put the dredge
in the secondary pond.

11:26.433 --> 11:28.166
That will clarify the water

11:28.166 --> 11:30.634
and it should be okay.

11:33.734 --> 11:35.200
Fred's plan,

11:35.200 --> 11:38.467
build a berm to
divide the pond in two,

11:38.467 --> 11:41.233
placing the dredge
between the two ponds

11:41.233 --> 11:45.934
so all the dirty water
from the sluice goes
straight into the lower pond,

11:47.967 --> 11:49.700
keeping the dive pond clear

11:49.700 --> 11:51.867
for the crew
to dredge for gold.

12:06.600 --> 12:11.400
Paul and Scott indicated
it was just gonna take 'em
a half a day

12:11.400 --> 12:14.300
to build that peninsula
all the way across that pond.

12:14.300 --> 12:15.900
Ain't gonna happen.

12:15.900 --> 12:18.500
It'll be a day,
day and a half,

12:18.500 --> 12:21.533
maybe two days, especially
the way they're doin' it.

12:30.967 --> 12:34.133
Hey! Put your dirt
on top of dirt.

12:34.834 --> 12:36.200
Like right here...

12:36.200 --> 12:39.467
- Okay.
- ...and then just ease it,
then dump it.

12:39.467 --> 12:42.300
Don't ever dump dirt
in the water.

12:42.300 --> 12:43.900
Copy that.

12:43.900 --> 12:46.033
Water is like kryptonite

12:46.033 --> 12:48.634
if you drop dirt through it.

12:48.634 --> 12:51.333
Just dispenses it.

12:51.333 --> 12:54.700
You lose 80% of
the buoyancy of your dirt.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.166
I could get on that thing,

12:57.166 --> 13:00.800
and get that thing out there
15 feet in about an hour.

13:02.200 --> 13:04.333
It's hell to know stuff

13:04.333 --> 13:06.500
and not be able
to pass it on to people.

13:09.967 --> 13:12.533
What the hell y'all got
goin' here?

13:14.400 --> 13:16.634
You want me to get that thing
started for you

13:16.634 --> 13:19.367
so you can get
your ass moving?

13:19.367 --> 13:22.767
If you wanna show me
like exactly
what you're talking about.

13:22.767 --> 13:26.100
-'Cause I think I got an idea
but if I can--
- I'll go out there 20 minutes.

13:26.100 --> 13:27.934
- Cool. Go for it, man.
- All right.

13:30.066 --> 13:32.800
I kinda bowed to
the experience that Fred has.

13:32.800 --> 13:35.367
He's got a ton of time
on excavators.

13:42.000 --> 13:46.400
With nearly
a quarter of a century
in the construction business,

13:46.400 --> 13:49.500
there is nothing Fred doesn't
know about moving dirt.

13:51.266 --> 13:52.667
Come on, let's go.

13:53.800 --> 13:55.233
Now in the hotseat,

13:55.233 --> 13:57.767
the berm build shifts
into overdrive.

13:59.533 --> 14:02.166
You gotta teach
these young bucks everything.

14:07.400 --> 14:08.400
Up ahead...

14:09.100 --> 14:10.533
Ready for some noise?

14:12.133 --> 14:13.934
Nobody fall over the edge.

14:14.533 --> 14:16.033
Man, holy moly.

14:16.033 --> 14:19.400
This is what white water's
all about, folks.

14:28.166 --> 14:30.400
Man, if that'd go on top
of those, that'd be good.

14:31.166 --> 14:33.333
This is gonna go down there.

14:33.333 --> 14:34.967
We're gonna use it
for a dam.

14:34.967 --> 14:36.567
Come on, you [bleep]!

14:36.567 --> 14:38.867
Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's
a busy, busy day, amigo.

14:38.867 --> 14:40.400
Busy, busy day.

14:42.233 --> 14:43.667
At the Golden Gates,

14:43.667 --> 14:47.233
Dustin's crew battle
some of the most
challenging conditions

14:47.233 --> 14:48.800
they've ever faced.

14:48.800 --> 14:50.333
That's it!

14:50.333 --> 14:54.233
The goal, to have
their dredge in the water
by week's end.

14:54.233 --> 14:57.500
But first, they must build it
a safe harbor.

14:57.500 --> 14:59.700
We are way
behind schedule.

14:59.700 --> 15:01.433
Ideally we would've been
in the water already,

15:01.433 --> 15:04.000
had a couple of ounces
to show for it

15:05.100 --> 15:06.600
and it's just
taking us forever.

15:11.400 --> 15:13.033
Three, two, one!

15:17.634 --> 15:18.867
You hear that?

15:20.600 --> 15:22.166
They just popped a rock.

15:24.600 --> 15:26.734
High on
the ridgeline overhead,

15:26.734 --> 15:30.467
Kayla and Justin bushwack
deep into bear country

15:30.467 --> 15:34.233
in a desperate search for
a second dive site.

15:34.233 --> 15:37.000
We've got enough
elevation gain right here.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.767
If we start kind of
traversing across,

15:39.767 --> 15:42.133
maybe to find an edge
instead of keep going up,

15:42.133 --> 15:44.767
we might be able
to get a good view.

15:44.767 --> 15:47.233
We really need to
find somewhere
where the snow has melted.

15:57.700 --> 15:59.934
I'm just trying to get
a little foot-grab.

15:59.934 --> 16:02.500
That way, we at least
have good traction.

16:02.500 --> 16:07.000
And avoid sliding
down to who knows
what would stop us.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.000
I don't like how it looks
down there.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.867
We've made it higher
up the mountain.

16:18.000 --> 16:19.567
Try to get a view, vantage,

16:19.567 --> 16:22.667
So we can determine where we
might have a good spot

16:22.667 --> 16:23.734
to start mining,

16:24.767 --> 16:27.133
and we're still bushwhacking.

16:33.066 --> 16:35.667
After a grueling
4-hour climb,

16:35.667 --> 16:38.600
they have yet to find
what they're looking for.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.567
It's definitely
not easy.

16:40.567 --> 16:43.400
I thought I'd do a little
better, personally, at this
than I have been,

16:43.400 --> 16:47.233
but it's, uh...
it's exhausting.

16:47.233 --> 16:49.533
For new recruit,
Justin Peterson,

16:49.533 --> 16:53.233
the harsh trail is
a long way from his old job.

16:53.233 --> 16:57.767
From being a regular worker
at a weld shop to...

16:57.767 --> 16:58.834
- trekking in the--
- Mountain goat.

16:58.834 --> 17:01.200
To a mountain goat
and following Kayla,

17:01.900 --> 17:04.533
this is something else.

17:04.533 --> 17:06.533
- What have you gotten
yourself into?
- I know!

17:11.967 --> 17:14.734
It just keeps getting
thicker and thicker as we go.

17:14.734 --> 17:17.100
Let's go up
and through all this [bleep].

17:18.700 --> 17:20.300
Like, I think there's
a cliff edge right over here,

17:20.300 --> 17:21.667
but it's so overgrown,

17:21.667 --> 17:24.233
I don't know if we're even
gonna be able to see
from this side.

17:24.233 --> 17:28.100
With all this plant debris
and duff, it's real slick.

17:28.100 --> 17:29.800
There's really
no good footing right here.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.834
I wouldn't recommend
following me right here.

17:39.333 --> 17:41.300
I'm gonna climb up here
for just a second

17:41.300 --> 17:43.967
to see if maybe there's
an opening where
we can see something.

17:43.967 --> 17:46.567
There's no point in both
of us climbing up here
right now

17:46.567 --> 17:48.033
if it doesn't open up.

17:48.033 --> 17:49.800
- So I'll be back in a minute.
- All right.

17:53.266 --> 17:54.400
Careful.

17:55.634 --> 17:57.734
It's so [bleep] overgrown,

17:57.734 --> 17:59.700
it's just so hard to tell
where to go.

18:00.734 --> 18:02.533
I can't tell
where the ledge is.

18:03.533 --> 18:04.934
Can you see anything yet?

18:08.634 --> 18:09.767
Heck yeah.

18:09.767 --> 18:12.767
I see two good sections
without snow.

18:12.767 --> 18:15.533
- That is excellent.
- Yeah, that water's open.

18:16.533 --> 18:18.700
Running east to west,

18:18.700 --> 18:22.467
this stretch of creek is
exposed to
twice as much sunlight.

18:23.567 --> 18:26.333
This open water could be
their only chance

18:26.333 --> 18:29.567
to mine the creek this season.

18:29.567 --> 18:31.767
It looks like
there's a good-sized
stretch of creek here

18:31.767 --> 18:34.600
that's way more exposed
so it has no snow.

18:34.600 --> 18:37.266
Just knowing that it's not
covered in snow
all the way up

18:37.266 --> 18:38.867
is a huge accomplishment.

18:38.867 --> 18:43.834
If we cannot have to spend
that extra time
messing with the snow as much,

18:43.834 --> 18:46.133
that would save us
a lot of work.

18:46.133 --> 18:49.133
It's been quite
the day of a hike but
it was totally worth it.

18:49.133 --> 18:52.300
If we can bypass
that patch of snow above
the other crew's site,

18:52.300 --> 18:55.266
we could start sampling
and then find a spot
to put our dredge.

18:55.934 --> 18:57.166
I say we go back down

18:57.166 --> 18:59.266
and then start figuring out
where we're gonna
cut a trail.

19:05.333 --> 19:07.166
Come on, let's go!

19:07.166 --> 19:10.700
On the other side
of the mountain
at Porcupine Creek,

19:10.700 --> 19:13.433
in need of an injection
of cash,

19:13.433 --> 19:17.367
Dustin has turned to
his father, Fred, for help.

19:17.367 --> 19:19.767
Pretty soon I'm gonna have
my bucket into the wall,
aren't I?

19:21.734 --> 19:23.000
Just shove your bucket down.

19:24.867 --> 19:27.000
Don't dump. Don't dump.

19:27.634 --> 19:28.867
Hey!

19:30.000 --> 19:31.533
Don't dump.

19:31.533 --> 19:33.000
Just put it level

19:33.000 --> 19:34.634
and push right on out there.

19:35.867 --> 19:37.567
There you go.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.433
I know you know
how to build a road.

19:44.300 --> 19:46.133
Pretty soon,
they'll have it cut off.

19:46.133 --> 19:48.900
They'll be doing
all their activity out
into this pond here.

19:48.900 --> 19:51.834
This other pond over here
will be their discharge pond.

19:51.834 --> 19:54.600
We'll see how quick
he can get this peninsula
finished here.

20:00.233 --> 20:01.800
Flatten your bucket out
a little bit there.

20:02.767 --> 20:04.467
All right, back drag.
Right there.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.000
Whoo!

20:17.533 --> 20:18.867
Look at that, huh?

20:18.867 --> 20:20.600
- Oh, yeah.
- Almost like we know
what we're doing.

20:20.600 --> 20:21.767
[bleep] yeah.

20:22.967 --> 20:24.834
- What a day.
- Whoo. That's what I mean.

20:24.834 --> 20:26.100
What a day.

20:26.100 --> 20:28.133
After nine, ten hours,

20:28.133 --> 20:31.667
you start feeling a little bit
on the rough side.

20:31.667 --> 20:33.233
- I think
we're in great shape.
- Yeah.

20:33.233 --> 20:35.333
- Good job, guys.
- I'm excited about tomorrow.

20:35.700 --> 20:36.767
Me too.

20:36.767 --> 20:39.734
There's a pretty good chance
that Scott and Paul,

20:39.734 --> 20:41.600
they're gonna be
dredging up gold tomorrow.

20:54.567 --> 20:56.967
We may need to go over there
and fish for that other drill.

20:56.967 --> 21:00.834
After finding
the only section of
open water up-creek,

21:00.834 --> 21:03.734
Kayla and Justin's job
has just begun.

21:05.500 --> 21:08.967
Today's main goal
is to get
a trail started to our site.

21:08.967 --> 21:12.333
I have an idea of the area
that we're gonna go scout out.

21:12.333 --> 21:14.934
Either way, we need to get
a trail established

21:14.934 --> 21:19.433
to get around that cliff wall
that is blocking us right now.

21:19.433 --> 21:23.266
Dustin has
just the trail-busting tool
for the mammoth task.

21:24.233 --> 21:26.567
We got ourself
a really awesome jackhammer.

21:26.567 --> 21:29.367
We got the biggest widest
paddles I could get on it.

21:29.367 --> 21:32.233
I've used jackhammers
plenty of times before

21:32.233 --> 21:35.333
at different construction jobs
I've had in the past.

21:35.333 --> 21:38.133
But I've never quite
used 'em on a...

21:38.133 --> 21:42.133
bedrock wall over a creek,
trying to make a trail. So...

21:42.133 --> 21:44.033
this'll be something
really new for me.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.500
And we're off.

21:48.500 --> 21:50.800
All right.
Get ready to jack!

22:00.233 --> 22:02.367
Definitely a top-heavy load.

22:08.133 --> 22:10.166
It's not gonna
be easy, but...

22:10.166 --> 22:13.533
hopefully it kind of
flattens out a little bit
once we get farther up.

22:13.533 --> 22:16.567
It's just really hard to tell
past that corner.

22:16.567 --> 22:18.133
If we can at least
just get to that point,

22:18.133 --> 22:20.367
and then figure out
where to go from there,
that would be great.

22:22.166 --> 22:24.433
So, let's get at it.

22:24.433 --> 22:25.900
All right.
Ready for some noise?

22:36.066 --> 22:38.400
This rock's a little more
solid under the top stuff.

22:38.400 --> 22:40.634
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

22:40.634 --> 22:41.967
I'll try and get to
this edge a little more.

22:41.967 --> 22:44.734
I was hoping
I'd pop the whole line
and fracture it down, but.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.800
As Justin cuts
a path with a jackhammer

22:49.800 --> 22:53.700
that delivers nearly
900 impacts per minute,

22:53.700 --> 22:57.200
Kayla must find rocks strong
enough to risk her life on.

22:58.667 --> 23:00.634
The rock that we're
dealing with here is shale

23:00.634 --> 23:02.400
and shale's really crumbly.

23:02.400 --> 23:05.700
So it's hard to set anchors in

23:05.700 --> 23:08.433
because they don't
secure very well.

23:08.433 --> 23:10.667
The rock shatters.
There's a lot of cracks in it.

23:10.667 --> 23:13.567
And there can be cracks behind
that you don't even see.

23:13.567 --> 23:15.700
Sometimes when you're
hammering the anchor in,

23:15.700 --> 23:16.867
the rock just shatters.

23:16.867 --> 23:19.300
So it's kind of [bleep] rock
to be putting anchors in.

23:22.033 --> 23:24.967
Cutting a path on
this kind of grade and stuff,

23:25.934 --> 23:29.200
it's a new experience.
It's a bit crazy.

23:30.033 --> 23:31.667
But...

23:31.667 --> 23:34.133
if you can do what others
didn't do, you're gonna get
the gold.

23:34.133 --> 23:35.867
That's... it takes...

23:35.867 --> 23:37.634
It takes crazy
to find the gold.

23:47.867 --> 23:51.967
700 feet down-creek, to get
his dredge in the water,

23:51.967 --> 23:54.700
Dustin hauls in some
heavy equipment.

23:54.700 --> 23:57.867
So we're gonna go,
uh, set up some winches.

23:57.867 --> 23:59.734
Wes is gonna be on winches.

23:59.734 --> 24:02.133
We're gonna be in charge
of carrying them up there

24:02.133 --> 24:04.367
and bringing all this stuff
up for 'em,

24:04.367 --> 24:06.300
'cause this is some
heavy junk.

24:06.300 --> 24:08.066
It's not gonna be fun.

24:10.567 --> 24:12.500
If you don't mention how heavy
it is, then I can't feel it.

24:12.500 --> 24:14.967
So don't remind me, man,
about how heavy it is.

24:16.133 --> 24:18.500
This is heavy.

24:18.500 --> 24:19.767
These are real heavy.

24:19.767 --> 24:21.166
To complete the dam,

24:21.166 --> 24:24.066
they need
the 132-pound winches

24:24.066 --> 24:26.700
to drag the creeks boulders
into place.

24:26.700 --> 24:28.166
Nobody fall
over the edge.

24:32.900 --> 24:34.500
Whoa!

24:34.500 --> 24:35.834
Need a break.

24:40.567 --> 24:42.166
I've been trying
to set up camp.

24:43.300 --> 24:45.834
I have not been lifting
winches up mountains.

24:46.634 --> 24:48.200
But if we don't
get any gold,

24:48.200 --> 24:49.900
we won't make the end
of damn season.

24:56.033 --> 24:57.066
We're doing this.

25:07.033 --> 25:09.333
Yeah!

25:09.333 --> 25:11.100
Holy crap!

25:11.100 --> 25:13.033
Whoo-hoo!

25:13.033 --> 25:14.900
Ha, pressure marks.

25:15.634 --> 25:16.900
Look at that.

25:20.934 --> 25:24.066
So right now
we're trying to set up our
re-direct on the other side.

25:24.066 --> 25:26.533
To create a dam,

25:26.533 --> 25:29.166
Wes's plan is to install
a pair of winches

25:29.166 --> 25:31.767
on the near side
of the creek

25:31.767 --> 25:34.066
and a re-direct
on the far bank

25:34.066 --> 25:37.033
which will allow them
to maneuver
the lift pulley

25:37.033 --> 25:38.600
up and down the creek.

25:41.667 --> 25:43.000
Looking good.

25:43.000 --> 25:44.734
We're gonna use
this pulley

25:44.734 --> 25:48.066
to re-direct this line
to grab any rock

25:48.066 --> 25:50.066
anywhere up this creek.

25:50.066 --> 25:51.433
Anywhere, anywhere.

25:51.433 --> 25:54.900
But before they
can start dragging rocks

25:54.900 --> 25:59.266
Carlos has the dangerous task
of crossing the raging river.

25:59.266 --> 26:02.600
I don't know
how to get a re-direct
on that side

26:02.600 --> 26:06.333
without getting hurt,
washed away or killed.

26:08.166 --> 26:10.567
That's the fastest part
of this creek right now

26:10.567 --> 26:15.700
and that's going millions
and millions of gallons
in freakin' seconds.

26:16.333 --> 26:18.266
And it's freakin' deep.

26:18.266 --> 26:20.166
This water's next
level fast, dude.

26:20.166 --> 26:23.233
Yeah, no, I agree.
It's, uh, that's rough.

26:23.233 --> 26:24.667
Rough [bleep].

26:24.667 --> 26:29.100
If I can get out
to this main rock right here.

26:29.934 --> 26:32.567
Set up a temporary
anchor point.

26:32.567 --> 26:34.367
Yeah, dude,
it sounds like a great plan.

26:37.500 --> 26:38.734
Argh!

26:39.200 --> 26:40.734
Holy moly!

26:46.166 --> 26:48.600
I'm doing this again,
man, holy moly.

26:49.133 --> 26:50.200
Argh!

26:51.500 --> 26:52.300
Argh!

26:55.166 --> 26:56.166
I've got it.

26:56.634 --> 26:57.800
Made it.

26:57.800 --> 26:59.900
Good, good.

27:00.934 --> 27:01.934
Perfect.

27:02.967 --> 27:04.800
My wife would kill me.

27:07.300 --> 27:08.100
Argh.

27:08.967 --> 27:10.834
Oh, my, argh.

27:23.200 --> 27:26.033
Kids, stay in school
otherwise you'll be
doing this.

27:33.233 --> 27:35.734
Woo-hoo!

27:35.734 --> 27:36.700
Hoo.

27:36.700 --> 27:40.400
This is crazy. Wow.

27:42.700 --> 27:45.634
This is what white water's
all about, folks.

27:47.233 --> 27:49.367
Everything's so cold.

27:49.367 --> 27:51.000
All the sake of gold.

27:56.567 --> 27:58.433
First safety line secured,

27:58.433 --> 28:02.667
Carlos can now brave
the white water
further down the creek

28:02.667 --> 28:05.100
to bring the new winch
system online.

28:05.100 --> 28:06.266
How the hell
am I gonna get out of here?

28:08.467 --> 28:11.033
He's going swimming,
it's not even break time.

28:13.166 --> 28:14.767
I need that back.

28:17.200 --> 28:20.533
Yeah, there you go.

28:20.533 --> 28:24.934
Carlos is working right now
to put us a re-direct
on the other side.

28:24.934 --> 28:27.800
It'll just give us the ability
to, uh, direct our rocks

28:27.800 --> 28:29.066
and put 'em where we want.

28:31.734 --> 28:33.800
Looking good.
Let's do it.

28:36.200 --> 28:38.066
You gonna be dumb
you gotta be tough.

28:43.700 --> 28:44.900
Good job, man.

28:46.867 --> 28:49.266
- Coming up.
- Ah, you're not
getting over there.

28:53.634 --> 28:55.533
Little, hey, one at a time.

28:57.567 --> 28:59.734
How you do what you do,
man, I don't know.

28:59.734 --> 29:02.800
No problem, man,
we're good, we're good.

29:02.800 --> 29:05.800
Woo-hoo! Yeah.

29:05.800 --> 29:07.133
Rock water, man.

29:07.133 --> 29:09.934
Dude, I am such
a badass, bro, [bleep].

29:13.600 --> 29:14.900
Couldn't get
that to stick.

29:14.900 --> 29:18.066
Finally, with
the heavy use winches installed,

29:18.066 --> 29:19.734
the miners can get to work.

29:19.734 --> 29:21.100
Yeah!

29:21.100 --> 29:22.734
Oh, yeah, now
we're moving.

29:22.734 --> 29:25.166
We're so close
to getting the dredge in.

29:25.166 --> 29:26.600
I think this is gonna
work to our advantage,

29:26.600 --> 29:28.066
that's what I got
going right now.

29:31.400 --> 29:32.600
Up ahead...

29:32.600 --> 29:33.634
Fire it up.

29:33.634 --> 29:36.100
This water is nasty
and we can't see.

29:37.433 --> 29:39.266
Last thing I wanna
do is bust through the ice.

29:40.100 --> 29:41.667
Three, two, one!

29:42.567 --> 29:44.533
- Whoa.
- You almost died.

29:58.634 --> 30:00.467
At Porcupine Creek...

30:01.467 --> 30:03.233
Time to get dressed.

30:03.233 --> 30:04.734
Let's see what
that water looks like.

30:06.433 --> 30:08.767
...it's time to put
Fred's master plan

30:08.767 --> 30:11.300
to increase visibility
to the test.

30:12.800 --> 30:17.500
Ideally they would let this
front pond settle
just a little bit more

30:17.500 --> 30:20.333
but they need to get
in there and find out...
Get some gold.

30:20.333 --> 30:21.433
Fire it up.

30:24.133 --> 30:26.300
Come on, baby.

30:26.300 --> 30:28.700
Dustin is banking
on the Pilings Pond

30:28.700 --> 30:30.433
delivering some
fast gold

30:30.433 --> 30:32.900
to fund his Nugget Creek operation.

30:34.967 --> 30:39.433
The possibility that
there's just a pocket
of gold down there

30:39.433 --> 30:42.133
that's untouched, I mean...

30:43.533 --> 30:45.200
I won't let that haunt me,
I gotta find out.

30:49.166 --> 30:50.166
All right, there we go.

30:51.767 --> 30:54.166
- You copy?
- Got you.

30:54.166 --> 30:56.066
Yeah, loud and clear.

30:56.066 --> 30:57.533
Loud and clear.

31:02.433 --> 31:03.800
Good luck down there, Scott.

31:04.700 --> 31:05.700
Good luck.

31:05.700 --> 31:08.400
So far, the crew
is yet to dredge

31:08.400 --> 31:11.300
a single ounce of gold
from the pond.

31:11.300 --> 31:13.967
How's all your systems
working down there, Scott?

31:15.667 --> 31:16.934
All pretty
good so far.

31:16.934 --> 31:19.033
Water's good, air's good.

31:19.033 --> 31:20.767
Good water, good air?

31:20.767 --> 31:22.033
Good water,
good air.

31:22.033 --> 31:24.033
How's the visibility
down there?

31:24.033 --> 31:26.266
I got about
two inches.

31:26.266 --> 31:28.600
Well it's better than,
uh, last time

31:28.600 --> 31:31.533
when you said you couldn't
even see your fingers
in front of your mask.

31:31.533 --> 31:34.266
So, uh, hell, you got
visibility now.

31:34.266 --> 31:36.767
We'll call it, you got
visibility down there now.

31:38.133 --> 31:39.600
I'm zero to something.

31:39.600 --> 31:44.667
Just remember the old, uh,
woman and making love
to her at night.

31:44.667 --> 31:47.166
You're just kind
of feeling your way around.

31:50.734 --> 31:52.834
I'm bring something up
to get it out of the way.

31:56.834 --> 31:58.867
He pulled a piece
of board out

31:58.867 --> 32:01.233
that's got a big, old metal
spike sticking out of it.

32:01.233 --> 32:02.500
Just sounds like...

32:02.500 --> 32:03.567
Wow.

32:03.567 --> 32:04.734
Running in to that.

32:04.734 --> 32:06.333
Damn.

32:06.333 --> 32:08.233
That's a homemade nail.

32:09.166 --> 32:10.333
It can be deadly.

32:17.233 --> 32:20.567
Material is changing,
not, uh, the sludgy stuff.

32:20.567 --> 32:21.734
Yep.

32:21.734 --> 32:24.433
It feels a lot
more like that glacial fill.

32:24.433 --> 32:28.000
Huh, I'd be rising
those off the bedrock, man.

32:28.000 --> 32:31.033
Scott is down there
trying to, uh, find
the very bottom

32:31.033 --> 32:35.300
of, uh, where that
bedrock kind of flattens
out down there.

32:35.300 --> 32:38.667
That's where the, uh,
gold always is in, uh, Porcupine.

32:38.667 --> 32:41.300
This material
feels great.

32:41.300 --> 32:45.433
Hey, that's a good sign.
That is a good sign.

32:45.433 --> 32:48.266
I got a 12-foot
area cleared.

32:48.266 --> 32:51.300
Uh-oh, we got a little
problem here.

32:51.300 --> 32:54.967
The landlocked
dive site presents
a new problem.

32:54.967 --> 32:57.166
Uh, we got dirty water

32:57.166 --> 32:59.867
but it's circulating
back up here.

32:59.867 --> 33:02.634
It's three inches higher
in the back

33:02.634 --> 33:04.634
that it is at the front.

33:04.634 --> 33:08.634
In 15 minutes, that'll all be
right over the top of Scott.

33:08.634 --> 33:11.900
We gotta drain that water
out of there, I can guarantee.

33:12.433 --> 33:14.133
All right, Scott?

33:14.133 --> 33:16.367
You're in some
good hands with Paul.

33:17.600 --> 33:19.367
Fred's gonna go
grab the excavator.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.233
Dig us a trench see if we
can get this water

33:24.233 --> 33:27.533
to flow up and hopefully that
changes our flow.

33:27.533 --> 33:29.667
This water's nasty
and you can't see.

33:32.467 --> 33:36.500
If Fred's new plan
to clear the backed up
tailings doesn't work,

33:37.433 --> 33:39.333
the crew can forget
any chance

33:39.333 --> 33:41.500
of their much needed
pay day.

33:45.133 --> 33:48.266
Uh, about one more
dig and we ready to, uh...

33:49.300 --> 33:50.700
...dump some water.

33:54.567 --> 33:56.166
There she goes!

33:58.166 --> 33:59.900
He's flying out of here now.

33:59.900 --> 34:02.900
That should clear that pond
up in the front.

34:02.900 --> 34:04.400
Good job, man.

34:04.400 --> 34:06.333
All right, that's just
about done it.

34:06.333 --> 34:10.600
We got enough of a, we got
a good flow coming out
of the dirty water pond

34:10.600 --> 34:13.266
into the, uh, creek.

34:13.266 --> 34:15.467
Now, visibility
is a lot better than
what it has been,

34:15.467 --> 34:16.533
so, I'll take it.

34:17.266 --> 34:19.400
Looks really good.

34:19.400 --> 34:21.967
Hey, Scott, I think
you set the record
here for, uh,

34:21.967 --> 34:23.800
the longest session
without no plug ups.

34:35.266 --> 34:37.400
On the other
side of the mountain

34:37.400 --> 34:40.634
Kayla and Justin are
six hours into their mission

34:40.634 --> 34:43.000
to reach their potential
new dive site.

34:43.000 --> 34:47.133
But they still have another
300-feet to go.

34:47.133 --> 34:50.300
Hand cutting a trail,
it's definitely challenging.

34:50.300 --> 34:52.767
It seems like it goes
so slow,

34:52.767 --> 34:54.567
there's so much
that needs to be done.

34:54.567 --> 34:57.900
It makes it feel like
you're not really getting
any progress done

34:57.900 --> 35:00.600
and it's just an endless
chore, but...

35:00.600 --> 35:02.433
...slowly but surely
we'll get it done.

35:03.300 --> 35:04.467
Hey.

35:04.467 --> 35:05.900
What's going on?

35:06.867 --> 35:08.266
How do you like
our highway?

35:08.266 --> 35:10.367
I could drive my
four wheeler up here.

35:10.367 --> 35:12.066
All right, wait, wait, wait.

35:12.066 --> 35:15.533
This is way too much work
for you to do this.

35:15.533 --> 35:17.567
I need to know
if there's gold up there.

35:18.300 --> 35:19.900
So what I would do,

35:19.900 --> 35:21.333
I would go and put, like...

35:22.600 --> 35:24.033
They call it a P-line.

35:24.033 --> 35:28.967
And it's just basically,
an exploration trail.

35:28.967 --> 35:30.934
And then you find out
if it's possible,

35:30.934 --> 35:32.533
it's worth putting
in that effort.

35:32.533 --> 35:36.367
Makes sense if you just go
across the wall
trying to get it,

35:36.367 --> 35:38.567
you hit a dead end,
you've wasted all that time

35:38.567 --> 35:40.400
when you could've discovered
it with a little bit less

35:40.400 --> 35:42.000
and figured another route.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.233
You cut only enough.

35:43.233 --> 35:45.066
Just enough to where
it's not a lot of effort

35:45.066 --> 35:46.033
and you're moving fast.

35:53.233 --> 35:54.934
I'm gonna check
this rock right here

35:54.934 --> 35:56.533
figure out where to put
my first anchor bolt.

36:00.600 --> 36:01.767
It's all crumbly.

36:02.467 --> 36:03.533
Let's see.

36:05.333 --> 36:06.500
That's not the greatest.

36:12.033 --> 36:14.400
Using Justin's
P-line strategy,

36:14.400 --> 36:17.533
Kayla makes rapid progress
across the cliff.

36:21.533 --> 36:22.967
Can you see anything yet?

36:24.867 --> 36:26.333
Once we get around
this crest,

36:26.333 --> 36:27.867
there's land right here.

36:29.467 --> 36:32.266
Problem is, I just don't see
any good rock
for an anchor bolt.

36:32.266 --> 36:34.100
Unless I do it, like,
right here.

36:35.100 --> 36:36.600
But this isn't that
great a rock either.

36:37.967 --> 36:39.200
One failed bolt

36:39.200 --> 36:42.166
and it's a 20-foot drop
to the creek below.

36:42.166 --> 36:44.734
Last thing
I wanna do
is bust through the ice.

36:44.734 --> 36:48.266
I don't like it but
I'm gonna go for it.

37:01.133 --> 37:05.000
In Alaska,
you always have to keep
your head on a swivel.

37:05.000 --> 37:06.233
There it goes!

37:07.700 --> 37:10.900
Because you never
know what may fall
out of the sky.

37:10.900 --> 37:12.934
Woo-hoo! All right.

37:12.934 --> 37:17.266
Literally, literally
dropped us a package.

37:17.266 --> 37:22.166
Literally one of the hoses
that we need for the dredge.

37:22.166 --> 37:23.200
This looks...

37:25.200 --> 37:26.100
...perfect.

37:43.133 --> 37:44.433
On Nugget Creek,

37:45.433 --> 37:47.700
Kayla and Justin
are within inches

37:47.700 --> 37:50.400
of what could be their
dive site for the season.

37:50.400 --> 37:53.800
So the good news is, once
we get around this crest

37:53.800 --> 37:56.100
there's land right here.

37:56.100 --> 37:58.433
Oh, my goodness,
I can hear the water
around the corner.

37:58.433 --> 38:00.467
- Right there.
- Right there.

38:03.233 --> 38:04.266
All cleared.

38:09.767 --> 38:12.100
What I did was put my butt
against the snow

38:12.100 --> 38:13.333
and, like, shimmy
my feet across.

38:13.333 --> 38:14.800
All right.

38:14.800 --> 38:17.433
- We got a lot of land
to work with over here.
- Definitely.

38:21.266 --> 38:22.367
You see what I see?

38:23.533 --> 38:25.367
Look at those
banks over there.

38:26.800 --> 38:28.767
That's quite the sweep.

38:29.567 --> 38:30.634
I like this spot.

38:32.066 --> 38:33.066
What do you think?
You like it?

38:33.066 --> 38:35.700
Yeah.

38:35.700 --> 38:38.500
You can tell, like,
the way the bedrock
comes out right there

38:38.500 --> 38:40.033
that it pushed everything.

38:40.033 --> 38:41.900
- So this was where
everything was pushed to.
- Yeah.

38:41.900 --> 38:43.300
- Same with that...
- Same with that.

38:43.300 --> 38:44.934
- ...on that side.
-'Cause it hits rim,

38:45.467 --> 38:46.600
comes this way.

38:47.767 --> 38:49.567
Smashes over there.

38:49.567 --> 38:51.133
- This way.
- Here and backs up.

38:52.300 --> 38:54.033
You can tell
material's built up here.

38:58.166 --> 39:00.200
Free of ice and snow,

39:00.200 --> 39:04.467
this section of creek
is Kayla's only hope
for a successful season.

39:05.333 --> 39:07.066
Now it's time to do
some sampling.

39:07.066 --> 39:09.734
It's a lot more exciting
because now we know

39:09.734 --> 39:11.266
we have potential
to find some gold.

39:18.300 --> 39:19.533
So obviously when
we're panning

39:19.533 --> 39:22.333
we're looking for gold,
if it's obvious,

39:22.333 --> 39:25.634
but we're looking
for the black sands,

39:25.634 --> 39:28.233
pyrites, other heavy minerals

39:28.233 --> 39:31.033
that would give us an idea
of the gold being here.

39:31.033 --> 39:33.600
Gold tends to be the deepest
one of them all.

39:42.934 --> 39:43.934
I got gold already.

39:52.467 --> 39:53.266
Bingo.

39:54.867 --> 39:56.233
Usually
with water this fast

39:56.233 --> 39:58.700
most of it settles all the way
down to the bottom.

39:58.700 --> 40:01.467
So that fact that every pan
at least had a little bit

40:01.467 --> 40:02.967
was a really good sign.

40:02.967 --> 40:06.233
So the next step
is to get Paul and Scott
back with us

40:06.233 --> 40:07.166
and start dredging.

40:11.567 --> 40:14.166
I need a parking spot
right here for this dredge.

40:14.166 --> 40:15.667
These rocks are in my way

40:15.667 --> 40:18.700
and I need those rocks
right there.

40:18.700 --> 40:20.800
Down creek
at the golden gates...

40:20.800 --> 40:22.567
Bottle up.

40:22.567 --> 40:25.266
...in a desperate
attempt to get his dredge
in the water...

40:26.567 --> 40:29.934
Hell yeah! Nice job.

40:29.934 --> 40:33.367
...Dustin pushes
his winch system
to the brink.

40:33.367 --> 40:36.100
We need to get
rid of that big rock too
right there.

40:36.100 --> 40:38.200
That's the asteroid rock

40:38.200 --> 40:40.667
and we're gonna send
it back to outer space.

40:40.667 --> 40:44.500
To make this dam, it's ideal
to use big rocks like this

40:44.500 --> 40:46.233
but, God,
if we can't move 'em,

40:47.400 --> 40:50.000
we have to make smaller
rocks, more manageable.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.600
We're ready for power heads.

40:53.367 --> 40:57.133
The huge
asteroid rock is too large
for the winches.

40:57.133 --> 40:59.266
so they'll need
to blow it to pieces.

41:06.100 --> 41:07.300
Come on out of there.

41:09.300 --> 41:10.934
Hey, and...

41:12.333 --> 41:13.634
Argh!

41:13.634 --> 41:15.200
Come on, [bleep].

41:15.200 --> 41:18.700
There's our nemesis right now.
Need it out of the way.

41:20.100 --> 41:21.000
Three, two, one.

41:21.900 --> 41:23.934
That didn't
do anything, dude.

41:23.934 --> 41:25.266
Try that again.

41:25.266 --> 41:27.734
Has to move because
it's in my damn way.

41:28.800 --> 41:29.667
Ready!

41:30.867 --> 41:32.667
But blast
after blast

41:32.667 --> 41:35.433
the asteroid rock
refuses to budge.

41:35.433 --> 41:38.734
Get rid of this damn
thing, it's ruining
my life right now.

41:41.200 --> 41:43.734
In my opinion this should've
been done

41:43.734 --> 41:45.367
so I'm flipping out
a little bit.

41:46.734 --> 41:48.934
I need my
dredge in the water

41:48.934 --> 41:51.000
and I'm losing my [bleep].

41:51.934 --> 41:53.433
It's freaking me the [bleep].

41:53.433 --> 41:57.967
Like, nobody understands
how [bleep] important
this really is right now.

41:57.967 --> 42:00.900
But we all have to apply
for a new [bleep] job

42:00.900 --> 42:02.634
because we didn't get
this [bleep] done.

42:02.634 --> 42:04.867
What's our main objective
today, brothers?

42:05.667 --> 42:07.066
Parking spot for the boat.

42:07.066 --> 42:08.700
Is that right?

42:08.700 --> 42:10.467
Can you help me
do that today, man?

42:10.467 --> 42:11.533
Yeah, yep, yeah.

42:11.533 --> 42:12.834
I'd really appreciate it.

42:14.033 --> 42:15.333
Really appreciate it.

42:18.266 --> 42:20.533
Put another head in there.

42:20.533 --> 42:22.000
Oh, you wanna put
another one in there?

42:22.000 --> 42:24.667
Yeah, put, like,
as many boosters
that'll fit in there.

42:26.033 --> 42:26.967
Yeah, one more, yeah.

42:26.967 --> 42:29.033
Let's drill some more holes,
pop some more.

42:29.033 --> 42:31.734
Just snap that
into a million pieces.

42:37.133 --> 42:38.433
Argh.

42:41.700 --> 42:42.867
Ready!

42:44.567 --> 42:46.567
Three, two, one.

42:46.567 --> 42:47.667
No.

42:49.867 --> 42:50.767
Nothing.

42:51.634 --> 42:54.133
What the
just happened?

42:54.133 --> 42:55.400
That's our first misfire.

42:55.400 --> 42:56.667
Did they get unplugged
somehow?

42:56.667 --> 42:58.500
They probably unplugged
'cause of the current.

42:58.500 --> 42:59.800
Unplugged.

42:59.800 --> 43:02.300
I know y'all are working hard
and everybody's working hard

43:02.300 --> 43:04.667
I just, I don't think
everybody understands

43:04.667 --> 43:06.033
how important it really is.

43:12.166 --> 43:15.033
Fire in the hole!
Three, two, one.

43:17.266 --> 43:18.100
Whoa!

43:18.100 --> 43:19.667
Almost died.

43:19.667 --> 43:20.767
Oh, [bleep], you all right?

43:20.767 --> 43:21.734
Whoa, dude.

43:21.734 --> 43:23.567
- Holy [bleep].
- Freakin'...

43:23.567 --> 43:26.433
- You almost died
just now.
- Holy [bleep].

43:26.433 --> 43:27.634
You almost died.

43:27.634 --> 43:29.967
- You all right?
- Lucky [bleep] man.

43:29.967 --> 43:32.000
That's some
that come flying, that was...

43:32.000 --> 43:33.166
That piece is [bleep].

43:33.166 --> 43:34.934
Three, two, one.

43:35.800 --> 43:37.500
Whoa, whoa.

43:38.333 --> 43:40.033
That was freakin'...

43:40.033 --> 43:42.000
You almost died
just now.

43:43.000 --> 43:44.333
Did it get ya?

43:45.033 --> 43:46.934
Holy [bleep].

43:46.934 --> 43:49.867
This is 60-feet away
and it hit right here,

43:49.867 --> 43:51.533
Carlos was laying
right there.

43:51.533 --> 43:53.567
Holy [bleep].

43:53.567 --> 43:58.166
Fly rock is absolutely
the deadliest thing
that there is.

43:58.166 --> 44:01.400
I thought Carlos
was a goner, dude.
I was standing next to him

44:01.400 --> 44:03.066
and it him and he went
like this.

44:03.767 --> 44:05.100
I... Oh, my God.

44:05.100 --> 44:06.767
It just happened so fast.

44:06.767 --> 44:09.867
It, like, hit the bank
but it hit his shoulder
at the same time.

44:09.867 --> 44:12.967
And that rock weighs
probably, 20, 25 pounds.

44:14.934 --> 44:16.567
It blew the hell
out of that rock though.

44:17.100 --> 44:17.934
Are you hurt?

44:17.934 --> 44:20.500
No, just tell me
I'm not dead, dude.

44:20.500 --> 44:22.600
He was bleeding
for a little bit.

44:24.300 --> 44:26.700
Well, I only got two rules,
what are they?

44:26.700 --> 44:27.867
Don't die.

44:27.867 --> 44:29.533
- Don't get hurt.
- Don't die.

44:31.533 --> 44:33.600
No one tells my wife.

44:33.600 --> 44:36.200
Oh, my God, do not
put this on TV.

44:36.200 --> 44:37.533
She'll kill ya.

44:37.533 --> 44:39.967
Yeah, we figured
it was a good time
to call it for the day.

44:39.967 --> 44:41.767
Yeah, dude, we're done.

44:43.433 --> 44:44.767
It was almost catastrophic.

44:44.767 --> 44:47.567
We're superstitious when
it comes to big problems.

44:47.567 --> 44:48.867
Holy moly.

44:48.867 --> 44:50.400
When things
start to go wrong

44:50.400 --> 44:52.333
we bail, that's it.

44:53.467 --> 44:55.800
I'm getting
desperate right now.

44:55.800 --> 44:58.467
It's going on too long,
I'm running out
of damn money.

44:58.467 --> 45:00.500
No dam,
no dredge,

45:00.500 --> 45:03.033
and one of his crew
almost critically injured.

45:03.033 --> 45:06.033
Dustin's week
is left in ruins.

45:06.033 --> 45:08.367
I've got too much
tied up into this

45:08.367 --> 45:10.367
and I thought we'd be
in the damn water by now,

45:10.367 --> 45:14.033
I was naive and dumb
and now I'm desperate.

45:21.266 --> 45:25.333
At Porcupine,
Scott Allen is the only
member of Dustin's crew

45:25.333 --> 45:27.166
that's actually dredging
for gold.

45:29.166 --> 45:32.600
All the pressure is on him
to deliver a big pay day.

45:32.600 --> 45:33.634
Done.

45:34.767 --> 45:36.333
I think we found
a good spot here, buddy.

45:36.333 --> 45:37.834
Perfect.

45:37.834 --> 45:40.433
Give me a tug on
my umbilical so I can
orientate myself.

45:41.533 --> 45:44.166
All right, I'm pulling up
on your hose.

45:44.166 --> 45:48.000
That's not a bad dive, Scott,
you've been in for like,
five hours now, so.

45:49.300 --> 45:50.667
He's following
the hose there.

45:53.600 --> 45:55.200
After a five hour dive

45:55.200 --> 45:58.634
it's time to see
if all their hard work
has paid off.

45:58.634 --> 46:00.266
Did you started
cleaning bedrock?

46:00.266 --> 46:01.600
I was on bedrock
for a good long while

46:01.600 --> 46:05.333
so, I'm really excited
to see what's in this.

46:05.333 --> 46:06.600
One way to find out.

46:06.600 --> 46:07.500
Let's check it.

46:07.500 --> 46:09.000
Shut it down, let's go
check it out.

46:16.567 --> 46:18.033
All right, come on, baby.

46:19.100 --> 46:19.967
Is that?

46:19.967 --> 46:21.700
yeah, dude.

46:21.700 --> 46:23.233
There's three pieces
right there.

46:23.233 --> 46:24.433
That's nice.

46:24.433 --> 46:27.500
That's, whoa, look.
There you go, Scott.

46:27.500 --> 46:28.734
Wow.

46:29.700 --> 46:31.333
Wow, that's some
weight, man.

46:33.734 --> 46:35.767
Seven
jewelry grade nuggets,

46:35.767 --> 46:38.066
worth a lot more
than fine gold.

46:38.066 --> 46:40.367
It's been a long
dry spell but...

46:40.367 --> 46:43.533
- Somebody had to break it.
- You found the right spot.

46:43.533 --> 46:45.400
It's good to start
finally seeing some gold.

46:45.400 --> 46:47.834
I mean, this is the first
good gold of the season.

46:47.834 --> 46:49.934
This pond almost
had us defeated.

46:49.934 --> 46:51.233
It actually almost did.

46:51.233 --> 46:54.033
Oh, yeah. Look at that.

46:54.033 --> 46:55.367
I made
a few suggestions

46:55.367 --> 46:57.634
on how to clarify
that water a little bit.

46:57.634 --> 47:01.700
Well finally today
we got in there

47:01.700 --> 47:03.867
we actually found
a little bit of gold.

47:06.233 --> 47:08.300
It's a little bit hard
to leave right now.

47:08.300 --> 47:10.567
Just found some gold.

47:10.567 --> 47:13.300
But it's up to them
to continue this

47:13.300 --> 47:16.600
and it's time for me
to exit stage left.

47:19.066 --> 47:22.333
On the next
Gold Rush: White Water.

47:22.333 --> 47:26.166
The dredge
made it to Nugget Creek.

47:26.166 --> 47:29.033
All right, you guys,
we're gonna do some
heavy off-roading.

47:29.033 --> 47:31.900
Oh, [bleep],
it's working, man.

47:31.900 --> 47:33.634
Keep on going, pull, pull.

47:33.634 --> 47:34.934
Even with their head start,

47:34.934 --> 47:37.433
my crew still got a dredge
in the water first.

47:37.433 --> 47:39.433
That's an awesome sight,
seeing the dredge go in.

47:39.433 --> 47:42.700
We are in the water,
we are mining now.

47:42.700 --> 47:43.700
My
chest hurts.

47:43.700 --> 47:44.767
Freaking me out.

47:44.767 --> 47:46.700
So I'm either having
an anxiety attack

47:46.700 --> 47:48.800
or a [bleep] heart attack.

47:48.800 --> 47:52.033
He's gotta be all right
'cause we gotta get gold
out of Nugget Creek.

47:52.033 --> 47:54.967
Kayla's a beast,
I just try to keep up.

47:54.967 --> 47:56.667
You ready
to find some gold?

47:57.400 --> 47:59.033
Today's gonna be the change.

47:59.667 --> 48:00.934
The change we needed.
