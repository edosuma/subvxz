Doc Ock created

But it bonded with my friend
Flash Thompson to become a hero.

So, then he tried to create
another version called Anti-Venom.

Anti-Venom was created

If I can make it to the

10:56.557 --> 10:59.307
I might be able to access
the <i> Bugle</i> screens and stream through them.

10:59.408 --> 11:01.783

12:02.655 --> 12:04.055
(ALL GRUNTING)

12:04.122 --> 12:05.044
Hike.

12:05.130 --> 12:07.044
I totally used
a football word.

12:10.595 --> 12:13.175
Heads up. We got
company, 12:00.

12:14.546 --> 12:17.014
Yeah, we're a little busy
with our 6:00.

12:17.060 --> 12:20.776
I don't want to embarrass you,
Spidey, but it's only 4:30.

12:25.307 --> 12:27.050
Nice aim, soldier.

12:27.112 --> 12:31.510
Dude, Cap said I have
nice aim. I might pass out.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.318
Keep it together, Flash.

12:41.995 --> 12:46.654
Must make clean.

12:46.700 --> 12:49.904
I think I'm allergic
to your brand of soap.

12:50.006 --> 12:53.045
Let's slow you down a bit,
Anti-Venom.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.500
<i>Hope this thing's on.</i>
<i>Here goes nothing.</i>

12:55.546 --> 12:57.629
Whoa. It's MJ.

12:57.731 --> 12:58.950
Yeah, didn't you know?

12:59.020 --> 13:01.317
Even my non-Academy friends
are heroes.

13:03.395 --> 13:04.916
<i>People of New York,</i>

13:04.962 --> 13:06.294
<i>Mary Jane Watson reporting.</i>

13:06.386 --> 13:08.661
<i>Here's the low-downon
how to safely navigate the streets</i>

13:08.723 --> 13:10.715
<i>away from this Carnage mess.</i>

13:10.824 --> 13:12.699
(ALL CHEERING)

13:12.793 --> 13:14.626
(GRUNTING)

13:24.699 --> 13:26.838
SPIDER-MAN: We're here, gang.
Hold them off.

13:28.613 --> 13:29.841
(ALL GRUNT)

13:32.745 --> 13:34.097
Since when can they do that?

13:34.143 --> 13:37.230
Please, help me!

13:37.316 --> 13:39.965
- Shriek?
- Friend of yours?

13:40.129 --> 13:42.520
Trust me, nothing about her
is friendly.

13:44.118 --> 13:47.558
(LAUGHING)

13:49.722 --> 13:51.722
And we were so close.

13:53.365 --> 13:55.644
Come on, Shriek,
we're almost there.

13:55.722 --> 13:57.836
Any chance you might
just let us pass?

13:57.838 --> 13:59.838
(SHRIEKING)

13:59.840 --> 14:01.673
So unreasonable.

14:01.675 --> 14:04.042
Advance the line.
We can't get caught up here.

14:07.613 --> 14:09.013
(GRUNTING)

14:13.853 --> 14:15.879
SPIDER-MAN:
Cap made a hole. Let's go.

14:21.961 --> 14:23.150
Venom! No!

14:23.196 --> 14:24.832
Ki-yah!

14:24.909 --> 14:25.972
(VOCALIZING)

14:26.065 --> 14:28.894
Got him, Spidey.
You go while I... (GRUNTS)

14:29.566 --> 14:31.659
(GROANING)

14:31.705 --> 14:33.071
(GROANING)

14:36.113 --> 14:37.976
SPIDER-MAN:
They've got Iron Fist!

14:41.213 --> 14:42.816
Look out.

14:42.862 --> 14:44.082
No!

14:44.902 --> 14:46.985
(GROANING)

14:50.089 --> 14:54.158
I will cleanse you.
I will purify you.

14:56.893 --> 14:58.752
Hands off, Pal.

14:58.832 --> 15:00.711
(ALL GRUNT)

15:03.438 --> 15:05.937
Flash. Flash?
Wake up.

15:05.939 --> 15:07.496
We made it
to the 10 yard line.

15:07.597 --> 15:08.940
I think that's right.

15:10.175 --> 15:11.957
(GRUNTS)
I've got you.

15:12.003 --> 15:13.511
We've got to keep going.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.074
(ROARS)
(GRUNTS)

15:17.105 --> 15:21.019

(GROWLS)

15:25.207 --> 15:27.246
Wait. Cap!

15:27.418 --> 15:30.328
Move it, soldier. Don't look back.

15:31.271 --> 15:34.880
(LAUGHING)

15:34.968 --> 15:37.099
That's right.
Follow the Venom.

15:41.278 --> 15:42.685
(PANTING)

15:42.776 --> 15:44.778
(GROWLING)

15:44.825 --> 15:48.028
Man, I'm really getting tired of
playing Spider in the middle.

15:54.508 --> 15:57.912
(GRUNTS)  Too bad you're
unconscious, Flash.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.763
I think you would
kind of like this play.

15:59.826 --> 16:01.325
(GROWLING)

16:01.412 --> 16:03.583
Come on, slowpoke.
You can do it.

16:05.747 --> 16:06.802
(SHRIEKING)

16:06.856 --> 16:08.919
Shriek, you have
the worst timing.

16:10.528 --> 16:12.904
Hey, I have a friend
you should meet.

16:13.439 --> 16:15.006
(SHRIEKS)

16:19.678 --> 16:21.079
(GRUNTS)

16:24.708 --> 16:25.927
You'll thank me later.

16:26.044 --> 16:28.036
Actually, you probably won't.

16:28.161 --> 16:29.755
You have a terrible personality.

16:31.123 --> 16:32.357
Not yet, Anti-Buddy.

16:32.489 --> 16:34.325
We still need to get
you inside.

16:35.094 --> 16:36.527
(GRUNTS)

16:38.653 --> 16:40.889
Ew. This would be
fascinating if it wasn't

16:40.951 --> 16:43.468
the single grossest thing
I've ever seen. (HEART BEATING)

16:43.537 --> 16:47.155
Wow, Carnage. Looks like
you have a heart after all.

16:47.350 --> 16:49.647
So, what do I do now?

16:51.709 --> 16:53.011
(GROWLS)

16:59.287 --> 17:02.748
This would be a horrible time
to find out my plan isn't gonna work.

17:03.056 --> 17:04.849
Purify Venom.

17:06.513 --> 17:08.694
Purify the heart.

17:10.608 --> 17:12.146
(CONTINUES BEATING)

17:14.133 --> 17:16.867
(BEATS RAPIDLY)

17:18.203 --> 17:19.537
(GROWLS)

17:26.873 --> 17:29.639
I think we'll take this
as our cue to leave.

17:29.793 --> 17:31.022
Don't mind us.

17:44.530 --> 17:46.064
(SCREAMS)

17:46.522 --> 17:47.432
Harry!

17:48.498 --> 17:51.467
Too much to cleanse.

17:51.537 --> 17:53.420
To cure.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.174
(SCREAMS)

17:56.602 --> 17:58.626
No!

17:58.745 --> 18:02.280
You're supposed to destroy
the Carnage, not be destroyed.

18:03.126 --> 18:05.950
Must cure infection,

18:07.373 --> 18:10.221
no matter what happens to host.

18:10.283 --> 18:12.123
Hey, I need that host.

18:12.213 --> 18:13.744
Listen to me. Harry.

18:13.838 --> 18:16.383
You've got to get out of there.
Can you hear me?

18:16.429 --> 18:18.196
(GROWLING)

18:19.088 --> 18:21.205
If you won't listen
to Spider-Man,

18:22.791 --> 18:24.401
then what about Peter Parker?

18:24.463 --> 18:26.166
You're my best friend, Harry.

18:26.260 --> 18:29.315
I know you're in there.
You have to fight this.

18:33.795 --> 18:34.962
Pete?

18:35.151 --> 18:36.823
You... You're Spider-Man?

18:36.893 --> 18:37.933
Long story.

18:37.987 --> 18:39.106
I'll tell you all about it,

18:39.152 --> 18:40.526
but we gotta get you
out of here.

18:40.604 --> 18:43.158
Leave the Anti-Venom symbiote
here to do its job.

18:43.283 --> 18:45.877
Okay, Pete. I'm with you.

18:46.096 --> 18:48.693
(GRUNTS)

18:53.049 --> 18:55.312
(BEATING CONTINUES)

18:55.476 --> 18:57.468
SPIDER-MAN:
The Anti-Venom's not moving.

18:58.170 --> 18:59.398
What's going on?

19:00.617 --> 19:01.734
It needs me.

19:01.785 --> 19:03.985
It needs a host
to destroy Carnage.

19:04.136 --> 19:06.851
No. I'll do it. You go.

19:08.398 --> 19:10.316
Come on. Take me.

19:10.416 --> 19:12.527
(GRUNTS) I'm your host now.

19:12.707 --> 19:15.305
Pete, it's gotta be me.

19:15.469 --> 19:17.547
No. No!

19:17.664 --> 19:18.969
You'll be destroyed.

19:19.047 --> 19:22.078
It's the only way.
You know this.

19:22.242 --> 19:26.164
If anyone understands
being a hero, it's you.

19:27.273 --> 19:28.899
I can't let this happen.

19:29.016 --> 19:31.383
HARRY: You'll lose the city
if I don't do this.

19:31.430 --> 19:34.711
They need you.
The people need Spider-Man.

19:36.275 --> 19:37.942
(GRUNTING)

19:40.212 --> 19:42.199
Now, go. (GRUNTS)

19:42.282 --> 19:44.015
No, stop!

19:46.285 --> 19:47.885
(SCREAMING)

19:52.150 --> 19:56.924
Spider-Man.
My best friend is Spider-Man.

19:57.018 --> 19:59.230
How about that.

20:14.135 --> 20:16.380
Harry!

20:17.082 --> 20:19.250
(ALL GROANING)

20:32.869 --> 20:35.139
No! Buddy, come on.

20:35.233 --> 20:38.475
Wake up, please.
Harry!

20:39.505 --> 20:41.873
Quit with the screaming.

20:42.013 --> 20:44.031
I just saved the day,
didn't I?

20:44.123 --> 20:46.412
(CHUCKLES) Uh, yeah.

20:46.607 --> 20:48.623
You were better
than Captain America.

20:48.755 --> 20:50.170
(ALL GROANING)

20:50.311 --> 20:53.451
Because of you,
the city survived this.

20:54.976 --> 20:59.246
So, Spider-Man's my best friend.

20:59.352 --> 21:02.204
Yep. Does MJ know?

21:02.384 --> 21:03.431
Nope.

21:03.540 --> 21:05.970
Hey, kid I've never met.

21:06.015 --> 21:08.329
Why are you dressed
like Spider-Man?

21:08.423 --> 21:10.610
It's okay, Flash.
He knows.

21:10.712 --> 21:13.204
Wait. Flash Thompson?

21:13.793 --> 21:15.473
Well, this is awkward.

21:15.535 --> 21:17.683
Is everyone we know
a superhero?

21:17.762 --> 21:21.889
Not everyone. But who knows
what tomorrow's gonna bring.
