to be calling you.

16:24.244 --> 16:25.680
is to cut yours off.

16:25.723 --> 16:27.551
Do you think it would help?

16:28.552 --> 16:31.599
No. Don'’t fight.
Don'’t shoot.
It'’s cool.

16:31.642 --> 16:33.470
We'’re cool, man.
We'’re cool. All right?

16:33.514 --> 16:37.126
Hey, dickhead.
Grab my pills. Now.

16:37.170 --> 16:38.562
There you go.

16:38.606 --> 16:40.521
[Ronny] You'’re crazy, man.

16:40.564 --> 16:43.785
If I was crazy,
I'’d have chopped you up in
little pieces a long time ago.

16:43.828 --> 16:45.091
Give me my pills.

16:46.048 --> 16:48.877
Now, you listen to me, Ronny.
I'’m not crazy, okay?

16:48.920 --> 16:52.011
Mm-hmm.I'’m just misunderstood.
All right?

16:57.451 --> 16:58.800
[gunshot]

17:10.072 --> 17:13.467
[car alarm blaring]

17:14.729 --> 17:18.950
[police sirens wailing]

17:45.586 --> 17:47.457
Help!Leona!

17:51.026 --> 17:53.115
[grunting]Oh!

17:53.159 --> 17:54.551
[gasps]

18:17.096 --> 18:19.620
[sirens wailing]

18:21.839 --> 18:26.540
NYPD picked up
an Evan McCauley.
Drug deal gone south.

18:27.454 --> 18:29.760
Cops found a sword on him.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.546
Blade was made with a process

18:32.589 --> 18:35.984
hasn'’t been used
since, uh, Edo Japan.

18:36.027 --> 18:38.160
[woman] So?

18:38.204 --> 18:40.684
He claims he forged it himself.

18:40.728 --> 18:43.165
Another broker-turned-hipster
blacksmith.

18:43.209 --> 18:46.386
Oh, ye of little faith.
Are you seeing this, Nora?

18:47.213 --> 18:50.346
Treadway?Precisely.

18:50.390 --> 18:53.871
If we know, Bathurst knows.

18:53.915 --> 18:55.960
Be careful.

18:56.004 --> 18:57.658
Thanks, Mom.

19:07.015 --> 19:08.103
[door opens]

19:19.810 --> 19:21.508
Tell us
when you'’re done, sir.

19:21.551 --> 19:23.597
[Evan]
Can I get my phone call?

19:24.598 --> 19:27.166
Supposed to get
a phone call.

19:31.605 --> 19:33.172
[chuckles]

19:39.961 --> 19:43.965
You'’re dressed way too nice
to be an NYPD detective, so...

19:45.271 --> 19:46.707
must be a doctor.

19:48.665 --> 19:50.145
Not a thing?

19:51.277 --> 19:53.627
No recognition at all?

19:56.020 --> 19:58.588
I think
I should feel hurt.
[chuckles]

20:00.721 --> 20:04.594
Do you remember... Syracuse?

20:04.638 --> 20:06.422
Syracuse.

20:06.466 --> 20:07.815
The siege.

20:08.816 --> 20:10.818
Second Punic War.

20:12.298 --> 20:13.777
Where we first met.

20:13.821 --> 20:16.954
Well, not quite the thrill ride
of the First Punic War,

20:16.998 --> 20:19.218
but, hey,
sequels are tough, huh?

20:20.088 --> 20:21.307
You disappoint me.

20:21.350 --> 20:23.439
Well, join the club.

20:23.483 --> 20:25.136
I notice...

20:26.660 --> 20:28.139
you didn'’t sign it.

20:31.665 --> 20:33.188
[laughs] Then again...

20:34.755 --> 20:37.061
craftsmanship like this...

20:38.367 --> 20:41.370
you didn'’t need to, did you?

20:41.414 --> 20:44.243
I made a sword.
Is that a crime?

20:45.679 --> 20:48.116
[sword hits table]Evan McCauley.

20:48.856 --> 20:52.207
Diagnosed with schizophrenia
at 14...

20:52.990 --> 20:56.037
after carving the words
"Look inside"

20:56.080 --> 20:59.258
into your chest
with a box cutter.

20:59.997 --> 21:03.479
Electroshock proved unhelpful.

21:03.523 --> 21:05.220
But these...

21:06.352 --> 21:08.049
are not bad, eh?

21:12.880 --> 21:15.535
Doctor, can I--Please. Go ahead.

21:18.277 --> 21:22.629
At 16, attempted suicide
via car crash,

21:22.672 --> 21:26.023
necessitating the steel plate
in your skull.

21:26.067 --> 21:28.939
Spent the rest
of your early life

21:28.983 --> 21:33.204
bouncing around
between psych hospitals
and foster homes.

21:33.248 --> 21:35.337
Well, I only cut
a couple of his fingers off.

21:35.381 --> 21:38.645
I don'’t think I'm gonna need
to plead insanity on this one,
am I, Doctor?

21:38.688 --> 21:39.994
I'’m curious.

21:41.256 --> 21:42.779
"Look inside."

21:44.564 --> 21:46.870
Why those words?Why not?

22:12.418 --> 22:16.335
Which one of these...
is yours?

22:17.379 --> 22:20.382
You can skip the--
whatever the hell this is

22:20.426 --> 22:23.254
because none of that
is mine.

22:26.301 --> 22:28.782
You'’re not supposed
to have that in here.

22:36.920 --> 22:38.357
What'’s going on here?

22:39.140 --> 22:40.359
Hey, Officer.

22:58.159 --> 23:01.641
Hey, what the hell
is going on here?

23:07.429 --> 23:08.822
Pick it up.

23:09.475 --> 23:10.693
What?

23:11.738 --> 23:13.087
Pick it up.

23:18.788 --> 23:20.137
Paris.

23:20.181 --> 23:21.965
1794.

23:22.836 --> 23:25.012
The last meal
of the Comte d'’Anjou.

23:29.669 --> 23:30.974
A Bordeaux.

23:31.714 --> 23:34.151
Not a bad choice
for a last meal.

23:35.283 --> 23:36.415
Was it yours?

23:38.373 --> 23:41.376
I wish I knew
what you were talking about,
but I don'’t know what to tell--

23:41.420 --> 23:42.638
Jesus!

23:42.682 --> 23:45.075
Every time you say,
"I don'’t know,"

23:45.685 --> 23:48.252
this trigger
gets pulled.

23:52.822 --> 23:54.650
Is it yours?I don'’t know--

23:54.694 --> 23:56.522
Are you out of your mind?

23:56.565 --> 23:58.872
We'’re in a police station!
Hello! Officer!The room is soundproof!

23:58.915 --> 24:04.399
They won'’t even hear it
when I put 250 grams of lead
through the back of your skull.

24:10.536 --> 24:13.147
Is it yours?Yes. Okay, yes, it'’s mine.

24:13.190 --> 24:14.496
Are you happy?[trigger clicks]

24:14.540 --> 24:15.715
Jesus!

24:17.586 --> 24:20.023
Lying... won'’t help.

24:20.067 --> 24:25.289
Look. I'’m just a guy
who was at the wrong place
at the wrong time. That'’s all.

24:25.333 --> 24:26.943
Last chance, Evan.

24:28.510 --> 24:32.209
Is... it... yours?

24:35.822 --> 24:39.826
[hyperventilating]

24:46.920 --> 24:50.053
[yelling]

25:10.247 --> 25:12.554
[laughing]

25:12.598 --> 25:14.469
There'’s the Treadway I know!

25:14.513 --> 25:15.514
[clicks]

25:23.260 --> 25:26.263
Little trick I learned from you.

25:29.745 --> 25:31.530
Hello, old friend.

25:31.573 --> 25:33.314
[engine revving]

25:53.639 --> 25:55.031
Whoa!

25:58.687 --> 26:00.123
Get in!

26:13.397 --> 26:14.921
Hold on.Shit!

26:21.841 --> 26:23.364
[shouting]

26:23.407 --> 26:24.974
[grunts]

26:34.157 --> 26:35.332
Go! Turn! Turn!

26:48.694 --> 26:49.869
Oh, shit!

26:52.611 --> 26:54.351
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

26:55.831 --> 26:56.963
Go! Go!

27:01.881 --> 27:04.013
Inside![shouting]

27:04.057 --> 27:06.581
Hold tight.Oh, sh...

27:10.541 --> 27:12.065
[grunts]

27:16.809 --> 27:18.506
[officer]
Cover!

27:20.203 --> 27:22.379
What are you waiting for?
Come on, let'’s go!

27:22.423 --> 27:24.294
Go the other way!Take the wheel.

27:24.338 --> 27:26.166
What?[policeman] Get out of the car!

27:26.209 --> 27:29.386
Yeah, sure.
Retractable steering wheel.
No problem. That'’s normal.

27:32.302 --> 27:35.044
Reverse.Shoot that son of a bitch.

27:39.832 --> 27:42.878
[clamoring]Move! Clear the street!

27:42.922 --> 27:44.924
Shoot the driver!

27:49.624 --> 27:51.104
Jesus Christ!

27:54.977 --> 27:56.936
[policeman] Who are they?

28:01.288 --> 28:02.506
Relax, it'’s bulletproof.

28:06.075 --> 28:07.642
180 now!

28:24.790 --> 28:25.965
Don'’t stop.

28:33.146 --> 28:34.713
[man yelling]

28:35.757 --> 28:37.716
[men screaming]

28:53.340 --> 28:55.472
[policemen yelling]

29:00.695 --> 29:02.001
[grunts]

29:10.618 --> 29:12.272
Can I ask you a question?Yeah, sure.

29:12.315 --> 29:13.708
Who the hell are you?

29:13.752 --> 29:15.188
I'’m Nora Brightman.

29:15.231 --> 29:17.668
Okay. But who was
that dude back there?

29:17.712 --> 29:20.062
Bathurst.
You didn'’t recognize him?

29:20.106 --> 29:22.282
No, I didn'’t.
But clearly you did.

29:22.325 --> 29:24.240
Well, you'’ve known him
a long time.

29:24.284 --> 29:27.330
I'’ve never seen that man
before in my life.
Him, I think I'’d remember.

29:27.374 --> 29:29.419
Well, not in this life,
maybe.

29:29.463 --> 29:31.639
Oh, no. Maybe I bumped into him
during the Second Punic War?

29:31.682 --> 29:33.989
Or maybe it was
the French Revolution.
I'’m bad with dates.

29:34.033 --> 29:37.253
You remember that?No. I don'’t remember
the French Revolution.

29:37.297 --> 29:39.908
I figured it out.
I see now. I get it.

29:39.952 --> 29:42.215
You do?None of this is real.

29:42.258 --> 29:44.086
It'’s a psychotic break.

29:44.130 --> 29:46.654
I'’m gonna wake up
in a hospital somewhere,
drooling all over myself,

29:46.697 --> 29:48.787
strung out on lithium.Is that easier to believe

29:48.830 --> 29:50.963
than the idea that maybe
destiny has something
more in store for you?

29:51.006 --> 29:54.488
Destiny? Where I come from,
we got bills to pay,
rent to make.

29:54.531 --> 29:57.447
Nobody'’s got time for destiny.That'’s a shame.

30:12.898 --> 30:15.465
I know you'’ve been
looking for answers,
Evan.

30:15.509 --> 30:17.816
But you'’re not crazy.
You never have been.

30:17.859 --> 30:20.775
No, I'’m not crazy.
I'’m just delusional.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.256
Do you ever find yourself
drawn to places
you'’ve never been?

30:23.299 --> 30:26.302
Do you ever see
a picture of a place
and just know you'’ve been there?

30:26.346 --> 30:27.608
Do you know things
you shouldn'’t?

30:27.651 --> 30:29.740
Do you pick up things fast,
almost as if

30:29.784 --> 30:32.526
you'’re remembering skills,
not learning them?

30:32.569 --> 30:34.571
I'’ve told
a dozen therapists this.

30:34.615 --> 30:37.096
I'’ve been analyzed
every way possible,
a hundred times over.

30:37.139 --> 30:38.532
It doesn'’t mean anything.

30:38.575 --> 30:40.882
Do you dream
in other languages?

30:40.926 --> 30:44.146
[speaks Russian,
Japanese]

30:44.190 --> 30:47.410
That'’s what schizophrenia is.
Different people, same head.

30:47.454 --> 30:50.936
What if it were
the same person,
different lives?

30:50.979 --> 30:53.895
You'’re talking
about reincarnation.Yeah.

30:53.939 --> 30:56.593
You can forge a sword
because you were
a blacksmith.

30:56.637 --> 30:59.596
You speak Russian
because you were Russian.

30:59.640 --> 31:01.337
Look, I hate to break it to you.

31:01.381 --> 31:04.427
It'’s a comforting idea,
souls moving from one body
to the next.

31:04.471 --> 31:08.344
But it'’s basically just
a spiritual equivalent of
"better luck next time." Okay?

31:08.388 --> 31:10.085
Nothing more and nothing less.

31:10.129 --> 31:13.088
Feel safe warm and inside
all that cynicism?I do, actually.

31:13.132 --> 31:15.525
And how'’s that
working out for you?In the grand scheme of things?

31:15.569 --> 31:17.440
Like big-picture shit?
Not so great.

31:17.484 --> 31:19.573
But I'’m good. I'm surviving.

31:20.922 --> 31:25.187
The visions you'’ve had
your entire life, Evan,
aren'’t hallucinations.

31:25.231 --> 31:26.667
They'’re memories.

31:27.668 --> 31:30.323
So, you'’re saying
that a hundred doctors
were wrong?

31:30.366 --> 31:35.284
Fifty medications didn'’t work
because I'’m really a
reincarnated Russian blacksmith?

31:35.806 --> 31:37.156
This is real.

31:37.983 --> 31:39.941
I'’m real.

31:39.985 --> 31:43.466
Oh, yeah? This is
no version of reincarnation
I'’ve ever heard of.

31:43.510 --> 31:44.903
Buddhist, Hindu, Sikh.

31:44.946 --> 31:47.688
They believe each life begins
with a clean slate.

31:47.731 --> 31:50.734
The answers you'’ve been
looking for all your life...

31:51.735 --> 31:54.825
all you gotta do
is get on that plane.

31:57.437 --> 32:00.309
You know what I'’m really
asking myself right now is?

32:00.353 --> 32:03.791
What if the craziest thing
I'’ve ever heard--
and this is some crazy shit--

32:03.834 --> 32:06.576
is actually
the first thing that'’s
ever made any goddamn sense?

32:09.188 --> 32:13.496
I don'’t gotta go feed the cat,
so... let'’s go.

32:33.212 --> 32:36.911
[speaking Italian]

32:40.741 --> 32:41.960
Go on.

32:43.744 --> 32:48.575
[speaking,
gurgling, choking]

32:51.665 --> 32:54.407
[speaking, gurgling,
choking continue]

33:00.065 --> 33:03.459
[gasping]

33:03.503 --> 33:05.984
[woman] They left
from a private airport.

33:06.027 --> 33:07.898
It was an unlisted flight.

33:09.596 --> 33:10.945
She was there fast.

33:12.425 --> 33:14.340
Too fast.

33:14.383 --> 33:18.083
The sword hadn'’t been
in the system
for more than a few hours.

33:18.126 --> 33:20.781
Then they have a base
here in New York.I want it found.

33:20.824 --> 33:24.263
It will lead us
to Evan McCauley.

33:24.306 --> 33:26.265
He will lead us
to the Egg.

33:26.308 --> 33:27.962
Again.

33:29.094 --> 33:31.574
[speaking Latin]

33:32.706 --> 33:36.971
[continues speaking
in Latin]

33:40.627 --> 33:42.629
[shouting, choking]

33:48.374 --> 33:50.593
[Nora] We call ourselves
the Infinite.

33:50.637 --> 33:53.161
Less than 500 souls
from across the globe,

33:53.205 --> 33:57.470
all born with the ability
to remember all our past lives

33:57.513 --> 34:00.342
and the skills we'’ve learned
in each of them.

34:00.386 --> 34:02.127
There are two groups
within the Infinites:

34:02.170 --> 34:07.088
Bathurst and the Nihilists,
who just want the world to end,

34:07.132 --> 34:09.612
and us... the Believers.

34:10.222 --> 34:11.962
And what is it
that we believe?

34:12.006 --> 34:15.662
We believe that our gift
is a responsibility.

34:15.705 --> 34:18.447
That it'’s up to us
to leave humanity

34:18.491 --> 34:21.320
better off than we found it.Yeah.

34:22.451 --> 34:24.540
I think
I'’m gonna need these.

34:57.312 --> 34:59.793
Hey.Hey.

34:59.836 --> 35:00.924
Thanks.

35:02.883 --> 35:05.190
Wow. It'’s a long way
from Arthur Avenue.

35:05.233 --> 35:06.495
[chuckles]

35:07.279 --> 35:08.802
It always blows
my mind.

35:09.716 --> 35:11.935
We call it the Hub.

35:16.592 --> 35:19.726
This is the place
where you'’re gonna get
your memories back, Evan.

35:22.207 --> 35:23.686
We'’ll be landing soon.

35:39.006 --> 35:43.141
Recognize anything?I'’m pretty sure
I'’d remember this.

35:43.184 --> 35:45.752
It used to be dedicated
to scientific research.

35:45.795 --> 35:48.058
Anthropology and linguistics.

35:48.102 --> 35:50.235
All of us using
what we'’ve learned.

35:50.278 --> 35:53.629
Life after life
for the advancement
of mankind.

35:53.673 --> 35:55.109
And what is it now?

35:56.066 --> 35:59.113
Headquarters
for the losing side
in the war.

36:00.375 --> 36:03.552
[shouting, grunting]

36:03.596 --> 36:06.033
Bathurst is the master
of combat.

36:06.076 --> 36:07.556
Hundreds of lifetimes.

36:15.956 --> 36:18.132
You must be prepared
for everything.

36:26.532 --> 36:28.577
He'’s the apex predator
in our world.

36:31.493 --> 36:32.973
Again.

36:38.587 --> 36:40.763
[speaking Japanese]

36:41.677 --> 36:43.201
Why are they bowing?

36:43.244 --> 36:45.768
They'’re hoping
you'’re Heinrich Treadway.

36:45.812 --> 36:47.944
[instructor] Again!Reincarnated.

36:47.988 --> 36:49.729
"Heinrich"?

36:49.772 --> 36:52.079
It was a popular name
in the '’50s.

36:52.122 --> 36:53.602
In the '’50s.

36:53.646 --> 36:57.040
Great for rock '’n' roll,
but lousy for names,
I guess.

36:57.084 --> 36:59.260
The 1750s.

36:59.304 --> 37:00.827
[instructor grunts]

37:02.176 --> 37:04.831
What do I know
that you need so bad?

37:04.874 --> 37:07.834
That'’s why you're here--
to find out.

37:08.704 --> 37:12.534
[grunting continues]

37:30.987 --> 37:34.991
This is Treadway'’s room.Are you asking me
or telling me?

37:35.035 --> 37:38.343
I must'’ve really screwed up
on my last incarnation.

37:38.386 --> 37:39.909
Why would you say that?

37:40.693 --> 37:42.999
Have you seen where I live
in this life?

37:48.962 --> 37:51.921
That'’s Treadway's
Himalaya diary.

37:55.708 --> 37:57.579
That was me.

37:58.406 --> 38:00.147
When I was Leona Warrick.

38:01.453 --> 38:03.977
And that was Treadway.

38:05.065 --> 38:06.806
[Leona screams]

38:06.849 --> 38:08.895
[gasping][grunts]

38:08.938 --> 38:10.288
[gasps]

38:11.593 --> 38:13.639
Two days after that picture
was taken,

38:13.682 --> 38:15.554
Treadway saved my life.

38:16.685 --> 38:19.601
There'’s a reason
you picked that book.

38:20.385 --> 38:22.909
All this tells me
is what he did.

38:22.952 --> 38:24.954
None of it tells me
who he was.

38:24.998 --> 38:27.914
Here we can study
anything and everything.

38:27.957 --> 38:31.396
Space, time, scale.
It'’s all relevant.

38:32.135 --> 38:34.224
That doesn'’t seem
like much.

38:34.268 --> 38:36.531
[woman]
Welcome to my virtual sandbox.

38:36.575 --> 38:38.403
Name'’s Garrick.Hi.

38:38.446 --> 38:40.883
Garrick is our head
of technology and research.

38:40.927 --> 38:42.972
He doesn'’t
look like much.

38:43.756 --> 38:45.845
Goddamn, it'’s good
to see you again.

38:45.888 --> 38:48.369
It'’s nice to meet you too.

38:48.413 --> 38:52.155
Don'’t worry.
All this shit,
it just gets weirder.

38:52.199 --> 38:53.505
Okay.

38:53.548 --> 38:54.984
Now let'’s get started.

38:55.028 --> 38:56.072
Follow me.

38:59.511 --> 39:01.295
Stand there for me,
please.

39:01.991 --> 39:03.036
Okay.

39:10.260 --> 39:12.219
[hologram powers up]

39:19.835 --> 39:22.011
That'’s the guy
from the police station.

39:22.055 --> 39:25.275
[Garrick] Bathurst.
He and Treadway
were once friends.

39:25.928 --> 39:27.713
A dozen lifetimes.
Wars, peace.

39:27.756 --> 39:31.369
They stood together at
some of the greatest moments
in human history.

39:32.370 --> 39:34.067
Then Bathurst lost faith.

39:34.110 --> 39:38.114
For the last 300 years,
he'’s been looking
for a way out.

39:38.158 --> 39:40.900
He needed a way
to stop reincarnating.

39:40.943 --> 39:42.771
He wants it all to end.

39:42.815 --> 39:45.252
[Garrick]
That'’s why he made this.

40:15.413 --> 40:19.982
[Garrick] The Egg,
designed to kill every
living thing on earth.

40:20.679 --> 40:23.159
[Evan]
That seems a little drastic.

40:23.203 --> 40:25.248
[Nora]
If there'’s nothing left alive,

40:25.292 --> 40:28.251
there'’s nothing left
to reincarnate into.

40:30.471 --> 40:34.823
[Garrick]
It attacks life
at the source-- DNA--

40:34.867 --> 40:37.478
unwinding the very fabric
of existence.

40:37.522 --> 40:41.569
Every plant, every animal
every person.

40:41.613 --> 40:42.657
Mama!

40:42.701 --> 40:44.485
[woman]
Jordan!

40:44.529 --> 40:47.488
[people yelling, screaming]

40:47.532 --> 40:49.011
I'’m coming!

40:54.408 --> 40:55.627
[screams]

40:55.670 --> 40:57.411
[Nora]
Like unplugging a computer

40:57.455 --> 40:59.195
when a program freezes.

40:59.239 --> 41:00.980
[Garrick]
Only when he pulls this plug,

41:01.023 --> 41:03.461
seven billion people
will go with him.

41:04.984 --> 41:07.769
Everything it kills
accelerates the process.

41:12.121 --> 41:15.864
God! Holy shit,
that felt freakin'’ real!

41:15.908 --> 41:18.824
Without you, none of us
would be here right now.

41:18.867 --> 41:20.173
What are you
talking about?

41:20.216 --> 41:22.871
Last cycle,
you raided Bathurst'’s lab,

41:22.915 --> 41:26.266
stole the Egg,
killed his Einstein and
everyone who helped build it,

41:26.309 --> 41:28.398
leaving him with no way
to recreate it.

41:28.442 --> 41:31.924
You took the secret
of the Egg'’s whereabouts
to your grave.

41:31.967 --> 41:34.883
Bathurst spent
this entire lifetime
looking for it.

41:34.927 --> 41:38.408
And he'’s getting closer
and closer to finding it
every day.

41:38.452 --> 41:40.541
That'’s why he
tracked you down
in New York.

41:40.585 --> 41:43.196
So I get on the plane,
you get all my memories back,

41:43.239 --> 41:45.285
and I save
the whole entire world,
right? That'’s it?

41:45.328 --> 41:46.765
That'’s pretty much
basically it, right?

41:46.808 --> 41:48.680
Told you it was
gonna get weird.

41:48.723 --> 41:50.159
So, what now?

41:50.595 --> 41:52.292
[phone rings]

41:53.598 --> 41:55.774
Tell me good news, Nora.

41:55.817 --> 41:59.908
[Bathurst] Bryan Porter.
Treadway had a gift
with steel, didn'’t he?

41:59.952 --> 42:04.522
Impeccable. Your friends
in the NYPD were certainly
impressed with it.

42:04.565 --> 42:08.787
Unfortunately,
their encryption skills
are less than impeccable.

42:09.657 --> 42:11.485
Led us right to you.

42:11.529 --> 42:15.097
[screaming]

42:15.968 --> 42:19.145
[groaning]

42:21.713 --> 42:25.238
You do know we have easier ways
of doing things now, right?

42:25.847 --> 42:27.109
Newer...

42:27.893 --> 42:30.504
almost never means better.

42:39.513 --> 42:42.951
We'’re going to uncover
Evan McCauley'’s location.

42:42.995 --> 42:45.301
We'’ll brute-force
your encryption.

42:46.564 --> 42:50.306
But I'’d consider it...
a courtesy...

42:51.351 --> 42:52.395
if you just...

42:53.788 --> 42:55.398
sped the process up.

42:58.314 --> 43:00.186
[chuckles]
Tell us where he is.

43:01.622 --> 43:04.538
[groaning]

43:08.150 --> 43:10.544
[coughing]
Okay.

43:11.893 --> 43:13.547
I know where he is.

43:14.635 --> 43:16.463
[coughing continues]

43:16.506 --> 43:17.595
Of course I do.

43:18.378 --> 43:22.121
I know exactly where he is.
I just...

43:25.037 --> 43:26.865
I, um...

43:26.908 --> 43:30.999
I sometimes have difficulties...

43:31.043 --> 43:32.740
[whispering] with my memory.

43:32.784 --> 43:33.959
[whispers]
Memory.

43:34.002 --> 43:35.656
[groans]I remember

43:35.700 --> 43:38.006
when you used to
gather honey

43:38.050 --> 43:40.356
on the fields
of Marathon.

43:40.400 --> 43:41.793
[groaning]

43:41.836 --> 43:46.406
Just another reminder
of how nothing
stays the same.

43:47.625 --> 43:49.191
[groans]

43:50.671 --> 43:51.890
[groaning]

43:56.329 --> 43:58.200
Would you care
for some?

44:03.075 --> 44:05.555
You know what
real torture is?

44:05.599 --> 44:06.992
Listening to you?

44:07.035 --> 44:12.127
[laughs] Real torture...
isn'’t physical pain,

44:12.171 --> 44:14.956
but human stupidity.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.481
Being surrounded by it,
engulfed in it.

44:18.525 --> 44:21.267
[groans]Lifetime after lifetime.

44:21.310 --> 44:25.140
[gurgling]People with their
idiot grins!

44:25.184 --> 44:27.708
Their infuriating
pleasantries!

44:27.752 --> 44:29.754
Their need for approval!

44:29.797 --> 44:33.627
Their unctuous attempts
to be loved and validated!

44:33.671 --> 44:37.370
They are walking,
talking obituaries...

44:37.413 --> 44:40.590
[groaning]...on the back page
of a dying newspaper,

44:40.634 --> 44:44.551
at the bottom of a birdcage,
in the corner of
a filthy living room

44:44.594 --> 44:45.857
of a hoarder cat lady!

44:45.900 --> 44:48.555
And we are forced...You'’ll never understand...

44:48.598 --> 44:51.863
...to live amongst them over......friendship, love.

44:51.906 --> 44:53.647
...and over endlessly.

44:53.691 --> 44:56.041
That is the true...You still don'’t understand
about faith!

44:56.084 --> 44:57.738
...definition of torture.

44:57.782 --> 45:01.263
Faith! Blah, blah, blah!

45:01.307 --> 45:02.525
Faith!

45:03.613 --> 45:04.702
[whispers] Faith.

45:06.181 --> 45:08.749
I'’m tired of faith.

45:08.793 --> 45:12.492
God must show me
his face.

45:25.897 --> 45:29.596
But thank you...
for enlightening me.

45:31.903 --> 45:33.513
[Porter screams, faint]

45:47.005 --> 45:49.224
You kept
his fucking body?

45:49.268 --> 45:50.704
Sexy son of a bitch,
isn'’t he?

45:50.748 --> 45:52.662
No. He'’s a dead guy
floating in water.

45:52.706 --> 45:54.621
That'’s pretty much
my worst nightmare.

45:54.664 --> 45:57.537
Actually,
it'’s a crotonic acid matrix.
Keeps the cells alive.

45:57.580 --> 45:59.713
Oh. That makes it
that much better.
Thank you.

45:59.757 --> 46:03.064
We'’re trying to understand
the science behind what we are.

46:05.414 --> 46:06.459
[beeps]

46:09.854 --> 46:14.336
[Nora] Treadway believed
that humans are capable of
so much more than we realized.

46:14.380 --> 46:17.383
[Evan] Is this what
you'’re telling me? I'm not
living up to my potential?

46:17.426 --> 46:19.428
I'’ve heard that speech before.

46:19.472 --> 46:23.781
[Garrick] Treadway pushed
past boundaries others might
call paranormal, superhuman.

46:23.824 --> 46:26.696
He can manipulate the energy
of the world around him.

46:26.740 --> 46:28.394
[Evan] I don'’t even know
what that means.

46:28.437 --> 46:30.309
[Garrick] What it means
is you'’ll have skills

46:30.352 --> 46:33.007
beyond anything
you'’ve ever imagined.

46:33.051 --> 46:35.357
Those abilities
are very deep.

46:35.401 --> 46:37.446
Below the conscious level.

46:37.490 --> 46:40.928
[Evan] I'’m down.
How do we get them back?

46:40.972 --> 46:42.582
[grunting]

46:42.625 --> 46:45.019
[Nora] Here,
we retrain your memory.

46:45.063 --> 46:48.806
We combine the physical
and the mental to develop
new neural pathways.

46:57.292 --> 46:59.599
Memories are held
in every organ...

47:00.426 --> 47:02.254
every cell in your body.

47:10.915 --> 47:14.832
Regression takes
the kind of concentration
it takes years to develop.

47:14.875 --> 47:16.398
This is a shortcut.

47:17.356 --> 47:20.794
We shock your mind
into synching with the system.

47:29.020 --> 47:30.673
[grunting]

47:31.065 --> 47:32.284
[yells]

47:52.260 --> 47:57.483
[Garrick] It'’s working.
I'’m seeing increased activity
in all his memory centers.

48:04.969 --> 48:06.884
[yells]

48:30.081 --> 48:31.343
Hey!

48:39.742 --> 48:41.527
[groaning]

48:48.099 --> 48:50.884
[grunts]Come on.

48:52.364 --> 48:54.844
That'’s not Treadway.Really?

48:54.888 --> 48:56.281
He just beat you.

48:56.324 --> 48:58.544
Treadway would'’ve killed me.

49:00.024 --> 49:01.329
[groans]

49:05.377 --> 49:10.077
Wow. She wasn'’t kidding
about being at war, huh?

49:10.121 --> 49:12.732
Improving
the human condition.

49:12.775 --> 49:16.040
Sometimes you do it
by painting
a chapel ceiling.

49:16.083 --> 49:18.520
Yeah. And sometimes
you drop them
from a mile out.

49:18.564 --> 49:20.740
Don'’t touch that.

49:20.783 --> 49:22.394
Okay, okay.

49:25.701 --> 49:28.182
That'’s no gun
I'’ve ever seen before.

49:28.226 --> 49:31.881
We'’re reverse-engineering
Bathurst'’s Dethroner.

49:31.925 --> 49:36.277
A Dethroner?
I mean, dude, who'’s
coming up with these names?

49:36.321 --> 49:37.583
Look...

49:39.063 --> 49:41.152
you can'’t kill an Infinite.
You kill the body, but...

49:41.195 --> 49:44.242
And they get reincarnated?Yeah.

49:45.243 --> 49:48.637
This implants in your head

49:48.681 --> 49:51.423
and pulls out
your consciousness...

49:52.554 --> 49:55.427
your soul,
and onto a digital chip.

49:55.470 --> 49:57.995
Your soul gets stuck on a disk
and breaks the cycle.

49:59.822 --> 50:02.956
Over 200 of our brothers
and sisters are lost

50:03.000 --> 50:05.045
in that digital purgatory.

50:05.959 --> 50:08.570
[exhales]
You come face to face
with this,

50:08.614 --> 50:12.922
my advice--
find a way to die
the old-fashioned way.

50:16.361 --> 50:18.015
[knocking]Come in.

50:22.323 --> 50:24.064
Okay if I look around?

50:24.108 --> 50:25.935
Be my guest.

50:45.303 --> 50:47.522
These are all you,
aren'’t they?

50:48.480 --> 50:50.656
They'’re people I once was.

50:52.005 --> 50:53.398
All of them.

50:56.096 --> 50:57.489
Wow.

50:57.532 --> 51:00.057
That'’s cool.
You look happy.

51:01.406 --> 51:03.016
I was.

51:04.148 --> 51:05.671
Who'’s that guy?

51:05.714 --> 51:08.543
In that picture,
he was Abel.

51:09.457 --> 51:14.245
Before then,
other names, other faces.

51:14.288 --> 51:15.942
But the soul...

51:16.682 --> 51:18.771
the soul was always him.

51:18.814 --> 51:21.904
So, what?
You loved each other
through multiple lives?

51:22.644 --> 51:24.820
These are all
the same place.

51:24.864 --> 51:28.085
Angkor Wat.
What we call the Beginning.

51:29.956 --> 51:33.177
I'’ll find you in the Beginning.

51:33.220 --> 51:34.700
[Abel] I love you.

51:34.743 --> 51:38.225
When each of us
would find ourselves
in a new life,

51:38.269 --> 51:39.879
this is where
Abel and I would go.

51:39.922 --> 51:42.577
You'’re reincarnated.
How would you know
where to go?

51:43.491 --> 51:47.365
Most of us have a reawakening
that begins young.

51:47.408 --> 51:49.976
Starts with small things,
memories,

51:50.019 --> 51:52.544
feelings about a place,
dreams.

51:53.197 --> 51:54.763
By puberty,

51:54.807 --> 51:56.852
most Infinites
have full recall.

51:56.896 --> 52:01.030
[scoffs] Right around
the time they diagnosed me
schizophrenic.

52:02.119 --> 52:04.512
So what happened
if you died young
and got separated?

52:04.556 --> 52:06.384
For an Infinite...

52:07.472 --> 52:09.648
death isn'’t the end,
it'’s like...

52:10.257 --> 52:12.564
turning the page in a book.

52:12.607 --> 52:15.567
Next chapter, same story.

52:16.394 --> 52:18.047
That'’s crazy.

52:18.091 --> 52:21.486
New lives, new bodies,
always meeting back
at the same place.

52:24.228 --> 52:25.403
He was Dethroned.

52:27.970 --> 52:30.495
He'’s trapped
on a computer
somewhere.

52:31.365 --> 52:35.108
My last life,
I got my memories back...

52:36.588 --> 52:38.546
and realized he was gone.

52:46.467 --> 52:48.948
It'’s not my memories
that matter, Evan.

52:50.602 --> 52:51.820
It'’s yours.

52:58.523 --> 53:01.439
Your last life,
in Mexico...

53:02.222 --> 53:04.442
where did you hide the Egg?

53:26.377 --> 53:28.161
[Bathurst]
Where'’s the Egg?

53:37.562 --> 53:39.651
Where is it?

53:48.921 --> 53:50.488
He'’s spiking.Shut it down.

53:51.489 --> 53:54.361
[groaning, panting]

53:54.405 --> 53:55.667
Hey, you'’re okay.[gasps]

53:55.710 --> 53:58.278
You'’re okay. Hey.
Hey, just breathe.

53:58.322 --> 53:59.540
I need to get up.Breathe.

53:59.584 --> 54:01.107
[Garrick]
Kovic, check his vitals.

54:01.150 --> 54:03.196
What happened in there, Evan?
What did you see?

54:03.240 --> 54:05.894
Your neural network fired off
like the Fourth of July.

54:05.938 --> 54:09.420
I'’ve been seeing this stuff
all my life. It still
doesn'’t make any sense.

54:09.463 --> 54:10.812
Why can'’t he
remember anything?

54:10.856 --> 54:12.423
Between the car accident,
the electroshock

54:12.466 --> 54:15.774
and the steel plate in his head,
his mind is fractured.

54:15.817 --> 54:17.776
Something in there
won'’t let the memories flow.

54:17.819 --> 54:22.868
I can'’t get them out.
I'’m afraid the Artisan
is our last hope.

54:29.178 --> 54:31.616
He'’ll achieve recall soon.
[blows]

54:33.444 --> 54:35.141
If he hasn'’t already.

54:43.628 --> 54:45.934
Hundreds of lifetimes,

54:45.978 --> 54:48.894
and it all comes down
to these few hours.

54:50.983 --> 54:53.246
If we don'’t find him...

54:55.161 --> 54:58.120
before he gets
his memories back...

54:58.860 --> 55:00.645
we lose the Egg...

55:02.124 --> 55:03.256
forever.

55:05.389 --> 55:07.216
The wheels keep turning

55:07.260 --> 55:10.089
and we can never...

55:11.743 --> 55:13.658
escape.

55:17.749 --> 55:19.881
We go at dawn.

55:53.480 --> 55:54.873
[shouting]

55:55.613 --> 55:58.920
[alarm blaring]

56:03.447 --> 56:06.058
[machine powers down]

56:12.499 --> 56:14.675
It'’s been a while, Otto.

56:14.719 --> 56:19.854
No one'’s called me
by that name in...
so many lifetimes.

56:28.820 --> 56:30.822
Hello, my love.

56:32.301 --> 56:33.955
What happened to you?

56:35.435 --> 56:37.829
You were so beautiful.

56:38.656 --> 56:40.179
As were you.

56:40.614 --> 56:42.442
You don'’t miss it--

56:42.486 --> 56:44.183
the agility...

56:44.923 --> 56:46.185
the vibrancy...

56:47.360 --> 56:48.796
being confined to this?

56:48.840 --> 56:52.104
You see me
as something broken.
I don'’t.

56:53.061 --> 56:55.629
You'’re the cripple, Otto.

56:55.673 --> 56:57.979
Crippled by your cowardice.Cowardice?

56:58.023 --> 57:03.115
No. I'’m crippled
by my memory.

57:03.158 --> 57:07.119
You get your memories back
over years. Not me.

57:07.162 --> 57:11.297
I get it all back
as my brain forms.
In the womb.

57:11.340 --> 57:16.737
Endless hours,
days, weeks, months.

57:16.781 --> 57:18.130
No room to move!

57:18.173 --> 57:20.654
Nothing
for my brain to do

57:20.698 --> 57:23.048
but eat itself.

57:23.091 --> 57:26.747
All these lifetimes,
the magnitude of this gift,

57:26.791 --> 57:29.315
and you haven'’t
learned a thing.

57:29.358 --> 57:30.925
I have to get out.

57:31.883 --> 57:33.450
I have to make it stop.

57:34.363 --> 57:38.193
Don'’t do it.
Don'’t give him anything.

57:39.456 --> 57:40.935
Where is Treadway?

57:47.725 --> 57:49.770
We storming the beach
at Normandy?

57:49.814 --> 57:52.077
You never know
with the Artisan.

57:52.991 --> 57:54.383
Let'’s get ready.

58:29.767 --> 58:31.072
[man]
Color out, please.

58:31.116 --> 58:33.379
[chattering, laughing]

58:34.685 --> 58:36.861
So, the Artisan'’s
a gambler?

58:36.904 --> 58:38.427
No, he'’s a hedonist.

58:38.471 --> 58:41.822
Infinite lies,
infinite opportunity
for debauchery.

58:41.866 --> 58:43.781
Sounds like
my kinda guy.

58:57.098 --> 58:58.970
[speaking Tibetan]

59:29.000 --> 59:31.916
[speakers:
opera music playing]

59:34.179 --> 59:37.443
[opera continues playing][sighs]

59:37.486 --> 59:40.141
Alexa, music off.[music stops]

59:40.185 --> 59:42.753
Get him cleaned up
and outta here.

59:42.796 --> 59:44.972
You'’re operating
on dead guys now?

59:45.016 --> 59:47.496
Da Vinci used to
cut into human cadavers

59:47.540 --> 59:50.630
so that he could
better understand
the human form.

59:50.674 --> 59:54.068
For me, I'’m all about
that brain, baby.

59:54.112 --> 59:58.333
[laughing]
But you know that
all too well.

59:58.377 --> 1:00:03.034
Oh, what a beautiful
cranial arch you got
this time around.

1:00:03.077 --> 1:00:07.473
I could better examine it
if I severed your head
from your neck.

1:00:07.516 --> 1:00:09.867
Like Treadway did to me
when last we met.

1:00:09.910 --> 1:00:11.825
Try it.Oh.

1:00:11.869 --> 1:00:14.045
Bathurst took the Hub.

1:00:16.874 --> 1:00:19.006
Does he have the Egg?No.

1:00:19.050 --> 1:00:21.400
Think we'’d be here
if he did?

1:00:22.706 --> 1:00:26.144
Wherever it is,
it'’s still in his head.

1:00:27.885 --> 1:00:28.929
Treadway?

1:00:28.973 --> 1:00:31.279
So they say.

1:00:32.890 --> 1:00:35.022
Wait. Is he blocked?

1:00:35.066 --> 1:00:36.894
[laughing]

1:00:36.937 --> 1:00:39.723
Well, well, well,
look at this.

1:00:39.766 --> 1:00:40.985
Huh.

1:00:41.812 --> 1:00:45.380
So, your hard drive
got fragged,

1:00:45.424 --> 1:00:48.557
which means we'’re gonna
have to reset your memory.

1:00:48.601 --> 1:00:53.606
And, Heinrich, I gotta tell ya,
I'’m really gonna enjoy this.

1:00:54.041 --> 1:00:56.087
Ooh! [laughing]

1:00:56.130 --> 1:00:57.741
Check this out.

1:00:58.263 --> 1:01:00.395
[machine powers up]

1:01:00.439 --> 1:01:03.398
You'’re all familiar
with the idea
that when you die,

1:01:03.442 --> 1:01:06.619
your life flashes
before your eyes, right?

1:01:06.663 --> 1:01:09.883
This machine
enhances that experience,

1:01:09.927 --> 1:01:12.190
prolonging
your sense of time,

1:01:12.233 --> 1:01:17.282
allowing you
to restore or reorder
everything inside.

1:01:17.325 --> 1:01:24.332
This-- This right here
is the closest you'’re gonna get
to a total mental reboot.

1:01:24.376 --> 1:01:25.420
[laughs]

1:01:25.464 --> 1:01:26.944
Are you planning
on trying to drown me?

1:01:26.987 --> 1:01:28.336
'’Cause I got a thing
about drowning.

1:01:28.380 --> 1:01:30.599
Which is?I don'’t like it!

1:01:30.643 --> 1:01:33.733
What kind of success rate
is this guy working with,
anyway?

1:01:33.777 --> 1:01:36.257
Confidence is... high.

1:01:36.301 --> 1:01:39.086
Yeah, and so are you,
obviously.

1:01:39.130 --> 1:01:40.827
[laughing] Okay. Hey.

1:01:40.871 --> 1:01:43.264
I like you this time around.
You'’re actually funny.

1:01:43.308 --> 1:01:47.878
Don'’t take this the wrong way,
but you'’re usually
kind of a jerk.

1:01:47.921 --> 1:01:49.531
It'’s true.Yeah, she gets it.

1:01:49.575 --> 1:01:51.664
So, I'’m supposed
to trust this guy?

1:01:51.708 --> 1:01:53.448
I wouldn'’t.First,

1:01:53.492 --> 1:01:55.233
I resent
the gender labeling.

1:01:55.276 --> 1:01:58.627
Second, you can trust
that we share the same goal.

1:01:58.671 --> 1:02:00.238
Really? Which is?

1:02:00.281 --> 1:02:03.807
Bathurst wants to what,
destroy every living thing
on Earth?

1:02:03.850 --> 1:02:07.636
Well, that'’s gonna ruin
a pretty great party
I'’ve got goin' on here.

1:02:07.680 --> 1:02:09.726
This guy'’s out of his mind.
Hey--

1:02:10.770 --> 1:02:13.860
There'’s a reason you
didn'’t bring me here before.Mmm.

1:02:13.904 --> 1:02:16.689
I could die in there.Yeah.

1:02:18.038 --> 1:02:19.518
[Evan] Could it work?

1:02:21.520 --> 1:02:22.695
It could.

1:02:24.001 --> 1:02:26.481
But you have a choice,
Evan.

1:02:26.525 --> 1:02:28.745
No, I don'’t have a choice.

1:02:29.528 --> 1:02:31.878
I... I can'’t let
anybody else get hurt

1:02:31.922 --> 1:02:33.750
because of what'’s in my head.

1:02:43.107 --> 1:02:45.500
All right.
Leap-of-faith time.

1:02:46.675 --> 1:02:49.243
Let'’s just do it now
before I change my mind.
All right?

1:02:49.287 --> 1:02:51.855
Let'’s go.
Turn your machine on.

1:02:51.898 --> 1:02:53.508
Ooh. Ready to go for a swim?

1:02:53.552 --> 1:02:56.076
Yes.
This is gonna be so fun!

1:02:56.120 --> 1:02:58.078
Just shut up and turn it on.

1:02:59.210 --> 1:03:01.778
[chattering, laughing]

1:03:17.794 --> 1:03:20.622
[earphone: Artisan]
...prolongs your sense of time.

1:03:22.973 --> 1:03:26.324
Whatever happens,
don'’t let them stop
until it'’s done.

1:03:31.677 --> 1:03:33.244
[exhales]

1:03:56.789 --> 1:03:58.835
[machine beeping]

1:04:08.192 --> 1:04:11.499
[Artisan] He'’ll hold his breath
as long as he can, and then...

1:04:11.543 --> 1:04:13.806
base instinct
takes over.

1:04:30.170 --> 1:04:31.737
Twenty-two.
Too many.

1:04:34.261 --> 1:04:36.568
[croupier]
Twenty. No more.
And 18.

1:04:52.976 --> 1:04:54.716
[alarm blaring]

1:04:54.760 --> 1:04:56.370
Oh, my God.
He'’s drowning.

1:04:56.936 --> 1:04:58.633
That'’s the whole idea.

1:05:02.289 --> 1:05:06.163
Maybe we should pull him out.He'’s not there yet.
Two more minutes.

1:05:13.039 --> 1:05:15.172
Abel, listen to me.
If I fail...

1:05:19.828 --> 1:05:21.134
Come on.

1:05:21.178 --> 1:05:24.224
Nora...He'’s dying.

1:05:24.268 --> 1:05:26.313
We'’re close.
We are close.

1:05:26.357 --> 1:05:28.272
[beeping]

1:05:28.315 --> 1:05:30.274
[sustained tone]

1:05:30.317 --> 1:05:33.233
Doesn'’t have a pulse![tone continues]

1:05:34.713 --> 1:05:35.714
Get him out!

1:05:41.894 --> 1:05:42.895
Come on!
Come on.

1:05:44.027 --> 1:05:45.289
[grunts]

1:05:53.558 --> 1:05:55.777
Okay. Okay.
[grunts]

1:05:56.691 --> 1:05:58.606
[grunts]Get out of the way.

1:06:02.784 --> 1:06:04.438
No!

1:06:16.320 --> 1:06:17.712
He'’s gone.

1:06:19.236 --> 1:06:20.889
[sobbing]

1:06:20.933 --> 1:06:22.935
We killed him.

1:06:22.979 --> 1:06:25.242
[Nora continues sobbing]

1:06:35.339 --> 1:06:37.254
[sobbing]

1:06:43.347 --> 1:06:46.219
[yells, groaning]

1:06:46.263 --> 1:06:49.614
[Treadway]
If I fail, look inside.

1:07:09.851 --> 1:07:13.942
[gasping]

1:07:13.986 --> 1:07:16.989
[coughing]Evan, you'’re okay.
Just breathe.

1:07:25.041 --> 1:07:28.044
[coughing, panting]

1:07:32.265 --> 1:07:35.312
I am Treadway.
I am Treadway.

1:07:45.191 --> 1:07:46.845
[gasps]Hey. Whoa, whoa.

1:07:49.630 --> 1:07:51.023
I'’m Treadway.

1:07:54.461 --> 1:07:57.943
[Kovic] If you are Treadway,
answer this:

1:07:58.857 --> 1:08:00.989
Do you know
where the Egg is?

1:08:21.314 --> 1:08:22.663
Yes.

1:08:23.142 --> 1:08:24.578
Yes?Yes.

1:08:25.188 --> 1:08:27.886
Look inside. Look inside.

1:08:30.323 --> 1:08:32.934
We were trained
to think of bodies
as unimportant, right?

1:08:32.978 --> 1:08:35.546
Right.Just shells
meant to be discarded.

1:08:36.242 --> 1:08:38.418
Well, Treadway knew
the one place

1:08:38.462 --> 1:08:40.116
that nobody would look.
