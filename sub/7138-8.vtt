WEBVTT

01:46.367 --> 01:48.100
all: I'm innocent.

01:48.100 --> 01:49.333
I'm innocent.

01:49.333 --> 01:51.533
- I am innocent.
- I'm innocent.

01:51.533 --> 01:54.900
- I'm innocent.
- Innocent.

01:54.900 --> 01:56.767
- I'm innocent too.

01:56.767 --> 01:58.367
- I'm innocent.

01:58.367 --> 01:59.567
You go to any prison,

01:59.567 --> 02:01.066
you ask any guy
who's serving time

02:01.066 --> 02:03.600
and he'll tell you
he's in-no-cent.

02:03.600 --> 02:06.433
I got a bum rap,
I had a lousy lawyer.

02:06.433 --> 02:09.000
I was in Toledo
visiting my mama.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.400
Yeah, you'll hear
a whole pack of lies.

02:11.400 --> 02:14.433
But what about that one brother
who's telling the truth,

02:14.433 --> 02:17.233
the one who really is innocent?

02:17.233 --> 02:20.567
His voice is buried
so damn deep beneath the others,

02:20.567 --> 02:23.066
he's gonna grow hoarse
just trying to be heard.

02:32.467 --> 02:34.000
- Leo!

02:34.000 --> 02:36.033
- Leo Glynn is dead.

02:36.033 --> 02:41.200
I'm sorry, the reality
just hasn't sunk in.

02:41.200 --> 02:44.333
- I feel so bad,
you know?

02:44.333 --> 02:47.166
He and I hadn't been
getting along lately.

02:47.166 --> 02:50.100
- Well, we all had our
disagreements with Leo,

02:50.100 --> 02:54.200
but still, he was the best man
for the worst job.

02:54.200 --> 02:55.467
- Amen.

02:58.667 --> 03:02.100
- I spoke to his ex-wife
at the cemetery.

03:02.100 --> 03:04.500
She and his daughter
didn't want to make the drive,

03:04.500 --> 03:08.400
would I pack up
Leo's belongings.

03:08.400 --> 03:11.467
I don't think she has a clue
about my relationship with him.

03:11.467 --> 03:13.700
- Mary knew.

03:13.700 --> 03:16.633
She said she was happy
Leo had someone.

03:16.633 --> 03:20.467
She hated the idea of him being
all alone after the divorce.

03:20.467 --> 03:23.000
- Tim, I talked
to the governor

03:23.000 --> 03:24.900
about naming you the new warden.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.734
I'm sure Devlin jumped.

03:29.734 --> 03:31.100
- Well, he didn't say no.

03:31.100 --> 03:33.767
- Doesn't matter,
don't want the job.

03:36.633 --> 03:39.533
- This place needs a strong,
sensible hand, Tim.

03:39.533 --> 03:40.734
That's you.

03:42.700 --> 03:45.100
- Stanton has some
interesting hearsay.

03:45.100 --> 03:48.400
- Lionel Kelsch
whacked the warden

03:48.400 --> 03:50.734
and Willy Brandt.

03:50.734 --> 03:55.400
And before that, he helped
Brandt waste Mayor Loewen.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.734
- How do you
know this?

03:56.734 --> 04:00.600
- Kelsch is a bragger,
and I hate braggers!

04:00.600 --> 04:03.600
- All right, take Stanton
into protective custody.

04:03.600 --> 04:05.567
Bring Kelsch to the hole.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.500
- All right!

04:12.233 --> 04:13.633
- You ever been
in the hole, Kelsch?

04:13.633 --> 04:14.800
- No, sir.

04:14.800 --> 04:17.300
- First, you're naked,
so it's cold.

04:17.300 --> 04:20.367
Then you piss
and shit in a bucket.

04:22.233 --> 04:24.100
Worse, you're alone,

04:24.100 --> 04:27.367
utterly alone,
24 hours a day.

04:30.433 --> 04:31.567
Except for the meals, right?

04:31.567 --> 04:32.967
When you see the hacks?

04:32.967 --> 04:34.500
- Theoretically.

04:34.500 --> 04:39.367
See, some of these guys,
they forget to bring the food,

04:39.367 --> 04:44.600
especially to someone accused of
killing the man they respected.

04:44.600 --> 04:47.033
- Hm.
- Strip.

04:47.033 --> 04:50.467
- Um, McManus, wait.

04:50.467 --> 04:52.233
What are my alternatives?

04:52.233 --> 04:55.133
- You can give me the name
of the person that hired you.

04:56.567 --> 04:59.567
- I thought the governor's
eulogy of Glynn was very moving.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.600
- Oh, yeah?
I nodded off.

05:01.600 --> 05:03.600
- What does McManus
want to see me about?

05:03.600 --> 05:05.400
- I don't know, he just
told me to find you.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.066
- Think he'll get
the warden gig?

05:07.066 --> 05:09.100
- Never know.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.567
- Don't be shy,
Officer Johnson.

05:16.567 --> 05:18.867
I'm gonna have to
read you your rights.

05:21.100 --> 05:24.433
- Before they cart
your ass downtown...

05:24.433 --> 05:26.166
just tell me why.

05:27.633 --> 05:31.867
Why--why'd you hire Brandt
in the first place,

05:31.867 --> 05:34.133
huh?

05:34.133 --> 05:36.200
Was it because of
those little girls?

05:36.200 --> 05:39.700
- I'm not saying word one
until I get a lawyer

05:39.700 --> 05:42.367
and cut myself
a nice, juicy deal.

05:45.967 --> 05:47.967
- Leo trusted you.

05:50.066 --> 05:51.800
- Let's go, man.

05:56.934 --> 05:59.400
- Tim,

05:59.400 --> 06:02.200
you remember back five years ago

06:02.200 --> 06:03.934
when you announced
from this very stage

06:03.934 --> 06:06.000
that I was eliminating
all high school

06:06.000 --> 06:09.233
and college
equivalency programs?

06:09.233 --> 06:12.233
I'm gonna give a speech
praising education

06:12.233 --> 06:15.333
as the one last hope
prisoners have,

06:15.333 --> 06:18.900
and naming the new program
after Leo Glynn.

06:18.900 --> 06:23.166
How the times have changed.

06:23.166 --> 06:25.500
Maybe it's me.
Maybe I've mellowed.

06:25.500 --> 06:28.400
- We've just received a call
from Detective Tarnowski.

06:28.400 --> 06:31.867
Adrian Johnson has implicated
Perry in the murders

06:31.867 --> 06:34.433
of Loewen, Brandt and Leo.

06:34.433 --> 06:35.867
- What?

06:37.367 --> 06:40.467
- You're next, Devlin.

06:40.467 --> 06:43.967
- Governor, we need to--
- Shut up, Perry.

06:47.633 --> 06:50.333
Cancel the press conference.

06:50.333 --> 06:53.066
Let's get back to the mansion.

06:53.066 --> 06:55.900
These charges are scurrilous.

06:55.900 --> 06:58.834
It's a vain attempt
to attack a fine, young man.

06:58.834 --> 07:01.767
- Yeah, who's one step away
from getting fucked up the ass,

07:01.767 --> 07:03.367
unless you can make a deal too.

07:03.367 --> 07:05.133
- Hey, I only--
- Shut up!

07:05.133 --> 07:07.400
- I'll handle this.
- How?

07:07.400 --> 07:08.967
See, I don't see
what you can do,

07:08.967 --> 07:10.734
except type out
your resignation.

07:10.734 --> 07:12.600
You know what the irony is?

07:12.600 --> 07:16.100
The irony is that
Wilson Loewen got you elected,

07:16.100 --> 07:18.100
and now, Loewen's ghost
is gonna bring you down.

07:18.100 --> 07:21.367
My only hope is that
when you go to prison,

07:21.367 --> 07:23.400
they send you here to Oz.

07:23.400 --> 07:26.200
- Ellie, you coming?

07:26.200 --> 07:29.900
- No, I'm not,
you little prick.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.667
- I accept
your resignation.

07:34.667 --> 07:36.800
Yours too, McManus.

07:36.800 --> 07:39.367
- I'm not going anywhere.
- We'll see about that.

07:40.633 --> 07:41.867
Perry!

07:48.767 --> 07:52.500
- Thank you all
for coming.

07:52.500 --> 07:55.000
Leo Glynn's untimely death

07:55.000 --> 07:56.200
has left an enormous void
in Oswald's--

07:56.200 --> 07:57.734
- Can the speech, commissioner.

07:57.734 --> 07:59.333
Just tell us who's
gonna be our new boss.

07:59.333 --> 08:01.033
- All righty.

08:01.033 --> 08:02.533
Some of you may already know him

08:02.533 --> 08:04.100
from when he
worked here previously.

08:04.100 --> 08:06.033
- Oh, no.

08:06.033 --> 08:08.333
- More recently, he's been
doing a bang-up job at Lardner,

08:08.333 --> 08:10.400
Martin Querns.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.433
- Hello, everybody.

08:12.433 --> 08:14.333
I'm back.

08:19.467 --> 08:22.066
Tim McManus,

08:22.066 --> 08:24.233
come on down.

08:30.066 --> 08:33.266
I don't know what you did
to piss off the governor,

08:33.266 --> 08:34.767
but he sure as shit
wants your head

08:34.767 --> 08:37.533
hanging off a spike
on the north tower.

08:37.533 --> 08:38.767
- So, I'm out.

08:38.767 --> 08:41.300
- Consider this
your month's notice.

08:41.300 --> 08:42.934
- Fabulous.

08:42.934 --> 08:45.767
- Of course, a lot
can happen in a month.

08:45.767 --> 08:47.467
This murder scandal
could mean the end

08:47.467 --> 08:50.834
of Devlin's days in office.

08:50.834 --> 08:52.934
- I don't know.

08:52.934 --> 08:55.300
He's skated through worse
and come out on top.

08:55.300 --> 08:58.533
- Like I said,
we have to wait and see.

08:58.533 --> 09:03.567
Of course, if he goes,
you may not have to.

09:03.567 --> 09:05.934
I wasn't lying when I said

09:05.934 --> 09:08.600
I was a big fan
of the concept of Em City.

09:20.000 --> 09:22.734
- Did he fire you?

09:22.734 --> 09:24.100
- I'm not sure.

09:30.500 --> 09:32.400
- Sister.

09:33.500 --> 09:35.033
Get your buns
in here.

09:38.333 --> 09:42.066
- This is a restraint chair.

09:42.066 --> 09:45.066
It will be placed in the hole.

09:45.066 --> 09:50.567
If you disobey,
you will be placed in it.

09:50.567 --> 09:53.266
I wanted you all
to see this monster,

09:53.266 --> 09:58.834
to let you know I will not
take any shit from anyone.

10:00.166 --> 10:03.700
So, remember...

10:05.467 --> 10:09.266
Don't fuck with Querns.

10:14.600 --> 10:18.367
- Here's a story,
and it's true.

10:18.367 --> 10:21.266
Mariano Absun escaped
the Connor Correctional Center

10:21.266 --> 10:22.667
in Hominy, Oklahoma,

10:22.667 --> 10:24.700
by hiding in the back
of a garbage truck.

10:24.700 --> 10:26.700
His body was found
two hours later,

10:26.700 --> 10:29.500
crushed to death
in the truck's trash tray.

10:29.500 --> 10:33.300
Now, Absun was only serving
a three-year sentence.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.533
Three years.

10:35.533 --> 10:38.166
That's how desperate he was
to get the fuck out.

10:52.367 --> 10:55.767
- Bob, can't sleep?

10:55.767 --> 10:59.200
- No, this is
the best time,

10:59.200 --> 11:02.133
when it's quiet,

11:02.133 --> 11:05.834
when the day still
has possibilities.

11:05.834 --> 11:10.266
- Today is Stella's first day
back after her breast surgery.

11:10.266 --> 11:14.166
- You're excited.
- And afraid.

11:14.166 --> 11:16.000
Before she went
into the hospital,

11:16.000 --> 11:18.500
I told Stella that I loved her.

11:18.500 --> 11:21.133
- Bob, you old seadog.

11:21.133 --> 11:23.266
- But she said I didn't.

11:25.433 --> 11:28.734
Which of course
means she doesn't love me.

11:35.633 --> 11:37.467
Stella?

11:41.600 --> 11:44.500
- I got your flowers.

11:46.800 --> 11:48.400
Oh.
- Did I hurt you?

11:48.400 --> 11:51.133
- No.

11:51.133 --> 11:54.934
I'm just not used
to the new breast yet.

11:54.934 --> 11:57.867
- I can't tell the difference.

11:57.867 --> 12:01.633
Only God can make a tree,
but fortunately,

12:01.633 --> 12:06.166
man can fix pretty much
everything else.

12:06.166 --> 12:07.633
- Any problems?

12:09.500 --> 12:12.200
- The medicine I'm on
is pixilating my memory,

12:12.200 --> 12:16.233
so, if I start to repeat myself
or forget a name,

12:16.233 --> 12:17.467
forgive me.

12:17.467 --> 12:21.967
- No, it's you
who has to forgive me

12:21.967 --> 12:23.734
for my silliness for thinking

12:23.734 --> 12:26.667
we both shared
the same feelings.

12:26.667 --> 12:28.734
- The same feelings?

12:28.734 --> 12:30.767
I don't know.

12:30.767 --> 12:34.400
But I do love you,
Robert,

12:34.400 --> 12:36.633
in my fashion.

12:36.633 --> 12:39.834
It's all a matter
of perspective.

12:41.934 --> 12:45.433
To see a world
in a grain of sand

12:45.433 --> 12:48.300
and a heaven
in a wild flower.

12:48.300 --> 12:50.867
- Hold infinity in
the palm of your hand...

12:50.867 --> 12:53.600
And eternity in an hour.

12:59.166 --> 13:01.166
- Ms. Coffo!

13:01.166 --> 13:03.767
Ad Seg is
a restricted area.

13:05.333 --> 13:07.133
- I want to see
Pablo Rosa.

13:07.133 --> 13:09.467
- Oh, he's not allowed
any visitors.

13:09.467 --> 13:11.734
- But I work here.

13:11.734 --> 13:14.300
- Those are the rules.

13:14.300 --> 13:18.967
- How do we get the rules
changed just this once?

13:18.967 --> 13:20.800
- I don't know.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.367
Talk to someone
higher up.

13:22.367 --> 13:24.934
- Who?
- I don't know.

13:24.934 --> 13:28.734
- He pretends to be
a tough guy, but he's not.

13:28.734 --> 13:31.900
Pablo's just another
terrified kid.

13:31.900 --> 13:36.500
And I'm afraid what's going
through his head right now,

13:36.500 --> 13:38.800
sitting alone in that hell hole.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.667
- What would you
like to happen?

13:40.667 --> 13:44.033
- Well, at the very least,
get him some books to read.

13:44.033 --> 13:47.033
- They'll never allow him
to have books in the hole.

13:47.033 --> 13:50.033
But there's always a way
to finagle something.

13:51.700 --> 13:53.000
How much cash
do you have?

14:00.233 --> 14:02.767
- Pablo,
can you hear me?

14:02.767 --> 14:04.233
- Ms. C.?

14:04.233 --> 14:06.233
You're okay?

14:06.233 --> 14:08.433
- I'm fine.

14:08.433 --> 14:10.400
And you?

14:10.400 --> 14:12.600
- I'm going
sort of crazy.

14:12.600 --> 14:17.000
- Well, I'm here
to help you with that.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.700
- How?

14:18.700 --> 14:22.066
- I'm gonna
read to you.

14:22.066 --> 14:27.200
"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,"
chapter one.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.934
Tom plays, fights and hides.

14:30.934 --> 14:34.500
"Tom."
No answer.

14:34.500 --> 14:38.066
"Tom!"
No answer.

14:38.066 --> 14:39.367
"What's going on with that boy?

14:39.367 --> 14:41.900
"I wonder, you, Tom!"

14:41.900 --> 14:44.033
The old lady
pulled her spectacles down

14:44.033 --> 14:46.600
and looked out over them
about the room,

14:46.600 --> 14:50.000
then she put them up,
and looked out under them.

14:50.000 --> 14:52.367
She seldom or never
looked through them

14:52.367 --> 14:55.500
for so small a thing as a boy.

14:59.433 --> 15:01.900
- I just had another visit
with Norma and the baby.

15:01.900 --> 15:04.233
Fatherhood is
a remarkable thing.

15:04.233 --> 15:05.767
- I wouldn't know.

15:05.767 --> 15:08.166
- What do you mean?
You had Alex.

15:08.166 --> 15:10.166
- But I didn't raise him.

15:10.166 --> 15:14.266
He never even knew I was alive
until he was a grown man.

15:14.266 --> 15:17.000
I was never
a father to my son.

15:17.000 --> 15:20.100
- Oh, and here's Ruby,
who's not my own,

15:20.100 --> 15:22.233
who I will
help to raise.

15:22.233 --> 15:26.033
Still, I'd like some day
to have my own offspring,

15:26.033 --> 15:28.834
from my own loins,
as it were.

15:28.834 --> 15:32.367
- Agamemnon, please.

15:32.367 --> 15:34.533
I've just eaten.

15:34.533 --> 15:36.533
- Well, I guess
it's a fool's goal,

15:36.533 --> 15:38.300
since we're not
allowed conjugals.

15:38.300 --> 15:39.700
And by the time I'm out,

15:39.700 --> 15:42.233
Norma will be past
her child-bearing years.

15:42.233 --> 15:44.233
- There are alternatives.

15:44.233 --> 15:47.066
Artificial insemination,
for example.

15:47.066 --> 15:49.367
- Sure,
I could jerk off,

15:49.367 --> 15:52.233
and then overnight my sperm
to Norma next-day delivery.

15:52.233 --> 15:54.300
Bob, you--
you're brilliant.

16:01.300 --> 16:03.100
- The commissioner
says no.

16:03.100 --> 16:05.300
- No?
How can he say no?

16:05.300 --> 16:08.000
- Well, he doesn't want to start
an avalanche of requests

16:08.000 --> 16:10.166
for prisoners to
artificially inseminate.

16:10.166 --> 16:12.467
He says that it opens up
the state to safety,

16:12.467 --> 16:14.867
security
and legal risks.

16:14.867 --> 16:17.100
- But I have a right
to procreate.

16:17.100 --> 16:18.800
- Well, not necessarily.

16:18.800 --> 16:21.233
The United States Supreme Court
guarantees a prisoner

16:21.233 --> 16:23.867
the right to marry
and not to be sterilized.

16:23.867 --> 16:26.633
Now, the justices have never
expressed an opinion

16:26.633 --> 16:28.500
on prisoners
bearing children.

16:28.500 --> 16:29.767
- What can we do?

16:29.767 --> 16:32.066
- We? Nothing.

16:32.066 --> 16:35.000
You should contact the society
for prisoners' rights,

16:35.000 --> 16:36.834
have them
assign you a lawyer.

16:36.834 --> 16:38.433
- I will, goddamn it.

16:38.433 --> 16:41.033
Just because I broke the law
doesn't mean I'm not a man.

16:41.033 --> 16:43.367
- True, but, Busmalis,

16:43.367 --> 16:46.200
not every man was
supposed to be a father.

16:46.200 --> 16:48.166
- Every man should
have a right to choose.

16:57.500 --> 17:01.900
- Whoa, go easy with
that stuff, Agamemnon.

17:01.900 --> 17:03.500
You're looking
like an oil slick.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.500
- You're right.
I'm nervous.

17:05.500 --> 17:07.266
The judicial panel
is meeting today

17:07.266 --> 17:09.867
to decide if I can
artificially inseminate Norma.

17:09.867 --> 17:11.734
If they say yes,

17:11.734 --> 17:14.233
I could be a father
by Christmas.

17:14.233 --> 17:17.533
- Have you talked this through
with Dr. Nathan?

17:17.533 --> 17:20.667
The entire procedure
is costly, time consuming

17:20.667 --> 17:22.934
and most often
unsuccessful.

17:22.934 --> 17:26.400
- Why are you always trying
to dampen my spirits?

17:26.400 --> 17:28.834
- Because you constantly rush
into things without thinking,

17:28.834 --> 17:30.433
only to get
your heart broken.

17:30.433 --> 17:32.066
- That's not true.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.633
Okay, maybe
it's a little true.

17:38.633 --> 17:41.934
But, Bob, in Oz,
that's all we have--

17:41.934 --> 17:45.333
hopes and dreams.

17:52.066 --> 17:54.367
- Having reviewed
the testimony and evidence,

17:54.367 --> 17:56.800
we have reached
the following conclusion.

17:56.800 --> 18:00.233
Since the state has the right
to eliminate conjugal visits,

18:00.233 --> 18:03.500
we do not see restricting
artificial insemination

18:03.500 --> 18:05.300
as unreasonable.

18:05.300 --> 18:07.166
And though we agree
that to procreate

18:07.166 --> 18:08.767
is a fundamental right,

18:08.767 --> 18:10.333
the very purpose
of punishment

18:10.333 --> 18:12.700
is to take away
fundamental rights.

18:12.700 --> 18:15.834
We, therefore, deny
the plaintiff's petition.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.900
- We lost?

18:21.900 --> 18:24.066
- I'm afraid so.

18:24.066 --> 18:26.967
- Well, we--we'll appeal.

18:26.967 --> 18:29.600
- No, I'm sorry,
there's no appeal.

18:29.600 --> 18:31.367
- Back to your cage,
Busmalis.

18:31.367 --> 18:34.133
- No.
- Don't give me any lip.

18:35.567 --> 18:38.333
- Wait, you bastard, wait!

18:38.333 --> 18:41.233
This is my life
we're talking about, my life!

18:41.233 --> 18:43.233
- Back off!
- You cocksucker!

18:43.233 --> 18:46.333
- Get this man off me!
- I'll kill you, motherfucker!

18:46.333 --> 18:48.700
But it isn't fair.

18:50.867 --> 18:53.500
It isn't fair!

18:55.867 --> 18:58.166
It isn't fair!

19:09.033 --> 19:10.934
- Morning.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.734
What's wrong with her?

19:14.734 --> 19:17.633
- Claire asked me
for a second opinion.

19:17.633 --> 19:19.300
- Is she sick?

19:20.800 --> 19:22.367
- She's pregnant.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.433
- You asked to see me,
Father?

19:30.433 --> 19:33.367
- Yes, come in,
sit down.

19:33.367 --> 19:35.100
- What's this about?

19:35.100 --> 19:37.567
- Your being pregnant.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.867
I'm not trying to insinuate
myself into anything.

19:39.867 --> 19:43.300
I just wanted you to know
that if you want to talk...

19:46.800 --> 19:50.500
- What I tell you
remains between us, right?

19:50.500 --> 19:53.600
Because I could
lose my job.

19:53.600 --> 19:56.266
- I promise.

20:02.767 --> 20:08.333
- My relationship with men
in general has been disastrous,

20:08.333 --> 20:11.033
yet here I am
surrounded by them.

20:12.800 --> 20:15.300
Which is why...

20:15.300 --> 20:19.133
Father, since coming to Oz,
I have fucked a lot of men.

20:21.300 --> 20:22.800
Oh, yeah!

20:22.800 --> 20:24.700
A lot of prisoners.

20:27.834 --> 20:29.834
You're shocked.

20:29.834 --> 20:30.900
- In a way, yes.

20:30.900 --> 20:34.367
And in a way, no.

20:34.367 --> 20:38.300
- Now, I'm pregnant
by one of them.

20:38.300 --> 20:40.533
- You know which one?

20:40.533 --> 20:43.166
- Well, my best guess is
the baby'll be golden brown

20:43.166 --> 20:45.967
and marinated in salsa,

20:45.967 --> 20:49.233
which means
I can't raise him or her

20:49.233 --> 20:51.300
in my redneck
neighborhood.

20:51.300 --> 20:53.467
I can't afford to move.

20:53.467 --> 20:55.333
And if I could,
where would I go?

20:55.333 --> 20:57.000
Little Havana?

20:57.000 --> 20:58.633
I am screwed.

20:59.834 --> 21:01.967
- Claire, are you thinking of
having an abortion, because--

21:01.967 --> 21:03.600
- Oh, save your
breath, Father.

21:03.600 --> 21:06.133
You Catholics aren't the only
ones who are against abortion.

21:06.133 --> 21:09.934
- So, what are you
gonna do?

21:09.934 --> 21:12.967
- Take a leave of absence,

21:12.967 --> 21:15.734
drop the calf,

21:15.734 --> 21:20.033
and from then on,
keep my fuckin' legs crossed.

21:32.300 --> 21:34.700
- I'll never be
a father now.

21:36.033 --> 21:38.734
- Yeah, well, we all
got our problems.

21:46.767 --> 21:49.166
- Here's a story,
and it's true.

21:49.166 --> 21:50.533
Up in Vermont

21:50.533 --> 21:53.066
an inmate was caught
breaking into prison.

21:53.066 --> 21:55.233
He'd evidently slipped out
of his work camp,

21:55.233 --> 21:57.066
went to a nearby
convenience store,

21:57.066 --> 21:59.500
bought a case of beer
and a carton of cigs

21:59.500 --> 22:02.300
and then crawled back
under the fence,

22:02.300 --> 22:05.834
where he was arrested
by the C.O.'s.

22:05.834 --> 22:08.266
The man was sentenced
to six more months,

22:08.266 --> 22:09.900
and the poor motherfucker,

22:09.900 --> 22:11.800
he didn't even get
to keep the beer.

22:13.033 --> 22:14.166
You know what I'm saying?

22:14.166 --> 22:16.467
- okay, raise your arms.

22:16.467 --> 22:19.100
Turn around.

22:19.100 --> 22:21.066
Through here.

22:22.600 --> 22:25.600
- Jackson Vahue,
welcome to Oz.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.800
- It's not my first visit,
warden.

22:27.800 --> 22:29.400
- I know.

22:29.400 --> 22:31.000
- Since being paroled,

22:31.000 --> 22:32.500
I've tried my best
to keep other guys

22:32.500 --> 22:33.900
from making my mistake,

22:33.900 --> 22:36.066
you know, lecturing the kids
and gangs and stuff.

22:36.066 --> 22:38.233
- I'm happy you're here
to do the same.

22:38.233 --> 22:41.233
Younger prisoners look up to
a big basketballer like you.

22:41.233 --> 22:43.133
- Well, I hope they hear
what I have to say.

22:44.600 --> 22:46.467
- After you.

22:46.467 --> 22:48.400
- So, in conclusion,

22:48.400 --> 22:51.166
I just ask you to use
your time wisely and well.

22:51.166 --> 22:52.400
With any kind of luck,

22:52.400 --> 22:54.100
you can pull your
life back together...

22:56.734 --> 22:58.900
And get the fuck
out of Oz.

23:03.667 --> 23:06.000
- Hey,
can I get your autograph?

23:06.000 --> 23:08.567
- Officer Brass, you still
dancing down these halls?

23:08.567 --> 23:09.600
- Yup.

23:09.600 --> 23:11.400
Some of us ain't
as lucky as you.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.600
- You know, I had nothing to do
with that tendon being sliced.

23:13.600 --> 23:15.467
- Oh, I know.

23:15.467 --> 23:17.367
Hey, I bought season tickets
to the Knights,

23:17.367 --> 23:18.834
so, I'll be at the arena
every time you play.

23:18.834 --> 23:20.233
- Uh-huh.

23:20.233 --> 23:22.400
- Maybe after a game I can
come into the locker room,

23:22.400 --> 23:24.166
hang out,
meet the other players.

23:24.166 --> 23:26.233
- No, I don't think so.

23:26.233 --> 23:29.033
- Oh, okay, um...

23:29.033 --> 23:31.033
Let me ask you
something, Jackson.

23:31.033 --> 23:32.767
When you're out
on the court playing,

23:32.767 --> 23:36.433
all those eyes on you,
you ever wonder?

23:36.433 --> 23:38.100
- Wonder what?

23:38.100 --> 23:40.133
- Who's out there?

23:40.133 --> 23:42.533
There's a lot of crazies
in the world, man.

23:44.200 --> 23:46.133
- No, I'm not afraid.

23:46.133 --> 23:49.900
- Bro, you got
huge stundeens.

23:49.900 --> 23:51.467
Nice to see you again.

23:54.033 --> 23:55.533
- All right, fellas.

24:08.367 --> 24:09.734
- Dave.

24:11.533 --> 24:14.667
- Sean, Sean,
you threw me off my game.

24:16.834 --> 24:19.233
Sometimes I wonder
if I wanted to play pro ball

24:19.233 --> 24:21.066
because I loved
the game so much,

24:21.066 --> 24:24.300
or because I wanted everyone
to see how great I could shoot.

24:27.400 --> 24:29.033
Be adored by millions.

24:29.033 --> 24:32.500
- Money, women,
the whole rigmarole, huh?

24:32.500 --> 24:34.834
- I don't care about
the fringe benefits.

24:34.834 --> 24:37.033
I want to be famous.

24:37.033 --> 24:39.400
I don't want to die
being some gimpy, old guard

24:39.400 --> 24:41.433
at a half-ass prison.

24:41.433 --> 24:44.000
I don't want
to disappear.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.967
- Well, I mean,
what can you do?

24:45.967 --> 24:47.967
You play the hand
life deals you.

24:47.967 --> 24:51.033
- Sean, I know you did
what you think is right

24:51.033 --> 24:52.767
about Morales.

24:52.767 --> 24:55.333
I want to tell you,
I admire you.

24:55.333 --> 24:56.900
I always have.

24:56.900 --> 24:58.700
No hard feelings, huh?

25:01.934 --> 25:04.333
- Why do I feel like
you're saying goodbye?

25:04.333 --> 25:06.033
- I am.

25:06.033 --> 25:09.300
I've decided,
I'm quitting.

25:10.767 --> 25:12.233
- To do what?

25:12.233 --> 25:15.300
- Reshuffle the deck,
play a new hand.

25:25.967 --> 25:29.066
- This just in,
basketball star Jackson Vahue

25:29.066 --> 25:31.033
was shot at
this afternoon

25:31.033 --> 25:32.934
during practice
at the arena.

25:32.934 --> 25:34.500
The assailant,
David Brass,

25:34.500 --> 25:36.433
has been working
as a guard...

25:36.433 --> 25:38.367
- Oh, shit!
- Officer Murphy?

25:38.367 --> 25:41.233
- Vahue served time at Oswald
and says he barely knew Brass,

25:41.233 --> 25:43.433
though they did play
opposite each other

25:43.433 --> 25:45.166
in a prison
basketball game.

25:49.533 --> 25:52.700
- Here's a story,
and it's true.

25:52.700 --> 25:55.100
A municipal court judge
in Texas

25:55.100 --> 25:58.333
was indicted on four counts
of sexual misconduct.

25:58.333 --> 26:00.900
Seemed this judge
extorted sexual favors

26:00.900 --> 26:03.600
from the female relatives
of criminal defendants

26:03.600 --> 26:06.300
in exchange for reducing
the defendants' bond,

26:06.300 --> 26:08.567
or ordering their release.

26:08.567 --> 26:11.734
Hey, when you're horny,
you're horny.

26:12.800 --> 26:14.533
- Mr. Hoyt, thank you
for coming to see us.

26:14.533 --> 26:15.767
I'm Father Mukada.

26:15.767 --> 26:17.400
- How do you do?

26:17.400 --> 26:19.400
- Oh, and this is
Sister Peter Marie.

26:19.400 --> 26:21.266
- Sorry.
Hello, nice to meet you.

26:21.266 --> 26:22.767
- How do you do?

26:24.300 --> 26:26.600
This...

26:26.600 --> 26:30.700
this is
my first trip to a prison.

26:30.700 --> 26:34.100
- Oh, you haven't
visited Jaz before?

26:34.100 --> 26:35.900
- No.

26:35.900 --> 26:39.867
I'm not exactly sure what it is
that you want from me.

26:39.867 --> 26:44.133
- Well, we feel that in order
for Jaz to fully recover,

26:44.133 --> 26:48.300
he needs to deal with
certain emotional problems.

26:48.300 --> 26:50.200
- Yeah.

26:50.200 --> 26:54.600
You can't blame
Evangeline and me

26:54.600 --> 26:56.867
for the way
the boy turned out.

26:56.867 --> 26:59.467
We were good parents.

26:59.467 --> 27:02.033
I mean, we didn't
just give him things.

27:02.033 --> 27:04.100
We--we gave him love,

27:04.100 --> 27:05.900
plenty of love.

27:05.900 --> 27:10.066
But there was always something
not quite right about the boy

27:10.066 --> 27:12.467
from the very first day

27:12.467 --> 27:15.934
that we brought him home
from the orphanage.

27:15.934 --> 27:18.467
- Jaz was adopted?

27:18.467 --> 27:19.734
- Oh, yes.

27:19.734 --> 27:22.333
My wife and I
couldn't have children.

27:22.333 --> 27:24.300
We adopted three.

27:24.300 --> 27:26.767
- Have you ever tried
to find out more

27:26.767 --> 27:28.567
about Jaz's birth parents?

27:28.567 --> 27:33.533
- Yes, the father
died in prison.

27:33.533 --> 27:37.400
The mother lived
in Morrisville.

27:38.767 --> 27:41.934
Whether she still
lives there, who knows?

27:41.934 --> 27:43.934
- Mr. Hoyt, could I have
the information

27:43.934 --> 27:45.834
about Jaz's
birth parents?

27:45.834 --> 27:47.400
- Certainly.

27:47.400 --> 27:48.567
- Drink your juice.

27:48.567 --> 27:50.533
- No.
- Drink your juice.

27:50.533 --> 27:52.000
- No!

27:52.000 --> 27:53.967
- Drink the goddamn juice.

27:53.967 --> 27:55.467
- No, bitch!

27:58.133 --> 28:00.333
Get the fuck
out of my face!

28:03.266 --> 28:06.066
- Jessica, one of the hardest
things about working in Oz

28:06.066 --> 28:08.934
is trying to separate
the man from his crime.

28:08.934 --> 28:11.367
If you can't do that,
even with Jaz Hoyt,

28:11.367 --> 28:13.467
you shouldn't be here.

28:13.467 --> 28:15.633
- I'm--I'm sorry.

28:15.633 --> 28:18.333
You're right, as usual.

28:18.333 --> 28:20.633
Let me--let me
make it up to you.

28:20.633 --> 28:22.033
Are you--
are you free for lunch?

28:23.433 --> 28:25.133
- No, actually.

28:25.133 --> 28:28.100
I'm in the middle of trying
to locate Hoyt's birth mother.

28:28.100 --> 28:30.133
- Why?

28:30.133 --> 28:32.500
- I want to know
where Hoyt came from.

28:32.500 --> 28:34.467
- In order to save him?

28:34.467 --> 28:37.066
- Well, yes.

28:38.500 --> 28:41.133
- You are a remarkable man, Ray.

28:41.133 --> 28:45.133
You are a saint.
- Hardly.

28:45.133 --> 28:49.400
- Well, if you won't have lunch
with me, how about dinner?

28:49.400 --> 28:52.567
You haven't eaten unless
you've tasted my roast chicken.

28:52.567 --> 28:54.800
I won't take no
for an answer.

28:55.767 --> 28:58.400
- All right,
I'd be delighted.

28:58.400 --> 28:59.800
- Great.

28:59.800 --> 29:01.533
7:30?

29:14.467 --> 29:19.033
- He was only one day old
when I gave him up for adoption.

29:19.033 --> 29:22.467
My boyfriend had just
been sent to prison,

29:22.467 --> 29:26.767
and my parents thought that
I should have a chance at life.

29:26.767 --> 29:30.400
Buster was a real bastard.

29:30.400 --> 29:35.600
You should excuse me, Father,
but he was a slimeball.

29:35.600 --> 29:38.734
My husband, John,

29:38.734 --> 29:42.700
he's a sweet, sweet man.

29:42.700 --> 29:44.467
I gotta tell you,

29:44.467 --> 29:48.066
I'm real nervous
about seeing my son.

29:48.066 --> 29:51.100
I actually thought
to call and cancel.

29:51.100 --> 29:54.467
- I'll be with you
every step.

29:54.467 --> 29:57.233
- Thank you.

29:57.233 --> 29:58.734
- Mrs. Oppenheimer,

29:58.734 --> 30:02.934
Jaz is in an extremely
volatile mental state.

30:02.934 --> 30:05.667
He may say terrible,
terrible things.

30:07.767 --> 30:11.000
- I have no expectations,
Father.

30:12.967 --> 30:16.266
I only hope that...

30:16.266 --> 30:20.533
I hope that my visit
can help make my son whole.

30:23.567 --> 30:25.667
- Are you ready, Jaz?

30:25.667 --> 30:27.867
- Uh-huh.

30:36.500 --> 30:40.934
- Hi.
- Mama, hello.

30:54.266 --> 30:57.066
- Well, we'll see you
at 12:00 noon tomorrow then.

30:57.066 --> 30:59.233
Excellent.

30:59.233 --> 31:01.900
Thanks again
for everything.

31:05.066 --> 31:07.066
Okay, goodbye.

31:08.767 --> 31:10.333
- Working late?

31:10.333 --> 31:12.800
- Well, yes.

31:14.133 --> 31:16.467
- I've been trying to do
what you suggested,

31:16.467 --> 31:20.133
to separate the man
from the crime,

31:20.133 --> 31:22.934
but I don't know, I see Hoyt
every day in the hospital ward,

31:22.934 --> 31:24.800
and the two seem
to be intertwined.

31:26.800 --> 31:28.333
- There are many,
many places

31:28.333 --> 31:29.734
looking for
qualified nurses, Jessica.

31:29.734 --> 31:31.100
I could help you.

31:31.100 --> 31:33.633
- Well, then we would
never see each other.

31:33.633 --> 31:38.934
- Look, I'm certainly not your
only reason for working in Oz.

31:38.934 --> 31:42.000
- Not my only reason, no,

31:42.000 --> 31:44.900
but I have
so few close friends.

31:47.734 --> 31:49.467
Here, let me.

32:00.033 --> 32:01.934
- Please, stop that.

32:01.934 --> 32:03.400
- Stop what?

32:04.934 --> 32:07.400
- Stop touching me.

32:07.400 --> 32:09.600
- Oh, I'm sorry.

32:09.600 --> 32:14.066
- No, I'm sorry that
I can't be more to you.

32:14.066 --> 32:17.633
- What do you mean?

32:17.633 --> 32:20.133
- I took a vow of celibacy.

32:20.133 --> 32:21.633
- Cel--

32:21.633 --> 32:23.533
do you--

32:25.567 --> 32:27.200
How dare you?

32:27.200 --> 32:29.400
I am a good
Catholic woman.

32:29.400 --> 32:32.166
I have been all my life.
- That's not what--

32:32.166 --> 32:35.667
- How dare you
have such thoughts?

32:35.667 --> 32:37.633
My son was right
about you,

32:37.633 --> 32:42.300
you are nothing but a fucking
slanty-eyed mongrel!

32:47.133 --> 32:51.100
- You do something for me;
kill Timmy Kirk.

32:51.100 --> 32:54.066
- What the--
- Ahh!

32:54.066 --> 32:55.467
- Ugh!

32:57.400 --> 33:00.367
- Ray, Ray.
Listen to this.

33:00.367 --> 33:03.533
After his mother left,
Jaz Hoyt really opened up.

33:03.533 --> 33:05.800
He told me it was
the Reverend Cloutier

33:05.800 --> 33:09.834
who ordered him to kill
Timmy Kirk the first time.

33:09.834 --> 33:11.667
- Well, how is
that possible?

33:11.667 --> 33:12.967
Cloutier was
in the burn unit.

33:12.967 --> 33:14.333
He was barely able
to make sounds,

33:14.333 --> 33:15.800
let alone speak.

33:15.800 --> 33:18.266
- Well, he says that Cloutier
appeared to him in his cell

33:18.266 --> 33:20.633
looking
completely normal.

33:22.033 --> 33:24.467
- An apparition?

33:24.467 --> 33:26.500
- Afterward, when he was
sent to solitary,

33:26.500 --> 33:28.567
his biker buddies
decided to take revenge.

33:28.567 --> 33:31.533
They went to the burn unit
and carried Cloutier away.

33:31.533 --> 33:32.834
- To where?

33:32.834 --> 33:35.734
- Well, Hoyt says
that's the one fact

33:35.734 --> 33:37.867
he will reveal
only to you.

33:40.467 --> 33:43.100
- Where did they take
the reverend Cloutier?

33:43.100 --> 33:44.700
- If I tell you,

33:44.700 --> 33:47.934
the other bikers,
they'll kill us both.

33:47.934 --> 33:51.600
- Hoyt, I need to know.

33:54.867 --> 33:56.600
- Okay.

35:05.867 --> 35:07.633
- Here's a story,
and it's true.

35:07.633 --> 35:09.066
A male prisoner

35:09.066 --> 35:11.166
at the Muskegon Correctional
Facility in Michigan

35:11.166 --> 35:13.367
sexually assaulted
the three-year-old daughter

35:13.367 --> 35:14.834
of a woman
who was visiting him.

35:14.834 --> 35:16.133
As a result,

35:16.133 --> 35:18.367
the State DOC came up
with the harshest,

35:18.367 --> 35:20.567
most restrictive
visiting policies

35:20.567 --> 35:22.333
of anywhere
in the country,

35:22.333 --> 35:24.133
which included
the banning of all minors,

35:24.133 --> 35:26.100
even family members.

35:26.100 --> 35:28.433
So you see,
one man's fuck-up

35:28.433 --> 35:31.000
fucked up
everybody else's happiness.

35:33.900 --> 35:35.867
- Redding, I have
to talk to you.

35:37.333 --> 35:39.533
I feel guilty lying
to my brothers,

35:39.533 --> 35:41.567
telling them
the book binding machinery

35:41.567 --> 35:44.133
was destroyed
by accident.

35:44.133 --> 35:46.800
- Did you get your check
from the insurance company?

35:49.734 --> 35:52.500
So none of you all
lost any money,

35:52.500 --> 35:55.800
which you sure as shit would
have when the company folded.

35:55.800 --> 35:58.567
- The money is
not the issue.

35:58.567 --> 36:03.533
You committed a criminal act,
and I'm benefitting from it.

36:03.533 --> 36:05.533
I have to do
something.

36:05.533 --> 36:08.266
- Whatever you do will
destroy your reputation

36:08.266 --> 36:09.967
with your brothers
over there.

36:11.300 --> 36:13.033
Can you live
with that?

36:40.400 --> 36:42.667
- You gonna tell me
what that was all about?

36:42.667 --> 36:45.433
- I was coming
to see you next,

36:45.433 --> 36:47.500
to make
a full confession.

36:49.166 --> 36:52.266
- I'm all ears,
as they say.

36:52.266 --> 36:55.233
- The accident which destroyed
the book-binding machinery

36:55.233 --> 36:57.500
was not an accident.

36:57.500 --> 36:59.700
Burr Redding
is responsible.

37:01.200 --> 37:03.200
- Why jabber now?

37:03.200 --> 37:05.400
- Because I feel guilty.

37:05.400 --> 37:09.600
I disgraced the memory
of Kareem Said.

37:09.600 --> 37:11.200
Each night
when I pray,

37:11.200 --> 37:14.300
the words become more
and more hollow.

37:14.300 --> 37:17.500
My soul is in peril.

37:20.667 --> 37:22.867
- I have to punish you.

37:22.867 --> 37:24.734
Officer.

37:27.667 --> 37:28.834
Take him back
to Em City,

37:28.834 --> 37:30.300
put him
in the cage.

37:32.867 --> 37:35.433
- I don't know what you're
talking about, McManus.

37:35.433 --> 37:38.400
I haven't been anywhere near
that book-binding machinery.

37:38.400 --> 37:40.400
- Arif says
you sent someone.

37:40.400 --> 37:42.333
- Arif is delusional.

37:42.333 --> 37:43.967
- What's going on?

37:43.967 --> 37:46.800
- I'm afraid you're gonna have
to find a new foreman, Donna.

37:46.800 --> 37:49.734
Redding's taking an early
retirement in solitary.

37:49.734 --> 37:51.233
- You got no proof.

37:51.233 --> 37:52.600
- Arif's word is
good enough for me.

37:52.600 --> 37:53.734
Get him out of here.

37:53.734 --> 37:55.734
- Uh, Tim,

37:55.734 --> 37:57.533
I just signed
a new contract

37:57.533 --> 37:59.367
with a major magazine
publishing house.

37:59.367 --> 38:01.333
I need Burr.
- I'm sorry.

38:01.333 --> 38:02.667
- Isn't there some deal
we can work out?

38:02.667 --> 38:04.133
- No, no deals!

38:04.133 --> 38:07.800
This is not a negotiation,
this is Oz!

38:29.767 --> 38:32.467
- Here's a story,
and it's true.

38:32.467 --> 38:36.600
The Wisconsin DOC has banned
all sexually explicit materials

38:36.600 --> 38:38.900
received by prisoners
through the mail.

38:38.900 --> 38:41.633
These include the swimsuit issue
of "Sports Illustrated,"

38:41.633 --> 38:44.767
copies of "Vanity Fair,"
"Maxim," and "Rolling Stone,"

38:44.767 --> 38:47.600
as well as various motorcycle
and fitness magazines.

38:47.600 --> 38:50.100
Also banned
was a photograph

38:50.100 --> 38:52.500
of Michelangelo's
Sistine Chapel.

38:52.500 --> 38:54.734
The DOC Felt
the nude paintings

38:54.734 --> 38:56.100
that adorn
the Vatican's ceiling

38:56.100 --> 38:59.934
could, quote,
"impede rehabilitation."

39:11.433 --> 39:13.500
- chucky.
- Hey, hey.

39:13.500 --> 39:15.266
- You make the call?

39:15.266 --> 39:16.533
- Yeah, I made the call.

39:16.533 --> 39:18.200
- And our mutual friend?

39:18.200 --> 39:19.834
- He gave the okay.

39:21.367 --> 39:24.667
- You know, Angelo and I have
done a lot of business together.

39:24.667 --> 39:26.967
In fact, at every club
I've opened,

39:26.967 --> 39:29.433
your nephew has been
like a silent partner.

39:31.867 --> 39:34.000
- I don't intend
to be so silent.

39:35.567 --> 39:37.967
- You need to mellow out,
big man.

39:39.033 --> 39:40.600
You ever done D?

39:43.033 --> 39:44.633
On me.

39:44.633 --> 39:46.834
Pass it out
to your boys.

39:54.300 --> 39:56.166
You see, Chulo,

39:56.166 --> 39:58.367
it's as easy
as one, two, three,

39:58.367 --> 39:59.967
dial me a dago.

40:15.767 --> 40:17.400
- Where'd you
get that?

40:17.400 --> 40:19.433
- From Torquemada.

40:23.266 --> 40:25.500
You ever been
to one of his clubs?

40:25.500 --> 40:27.133
- Nope.

40:27.133 --> 40:30.233
Never got past
the velvet ropes.

40:30.233 --> 40:32.066
Uh-uh.

40:32.066 --> 40:35.433
You better slow up
on them things, man.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.567
- I got into Dino's once.

40:37.567 --> 40:40.200
The lights,

40:40.200 --> 40:42.133
the sounds,

40:42.133 --> 40:44.066
and the women.

40:53.467 --> 40:55.800
- Yo, Chico,
settle down, man.

40:55.800 --> 40:58.633
The guard's going to put your
ass in the restraining chair.

40:58.633 --> 41:00.867
- Torquemada says he's going
to start giving destiny

41:00.867 --> 41:03.767
to the fuckin' hacks
too, man.

41:05.834 --> 41:07.400
Whoo!

41:15.900 --> 41:17.333
What's going on?

41:17.333 --> 41:21.033
What's going on?

41:21.033 --> 41:23.000
Where am I?

41:23.000 --> 41:24.567
Shit.

41:24.567 --> 41:26.500
- It's okay.

41:26.500 --> 41:29.066
- Stop, don't touch me,
don't, don't!

41:29.066 --> 41:31.533
Don't finger me,
don't, aah!

41:36.100 --> 41:39.200
Get it off--
get it off of me!

41:47.900 --> 41:49.133
- Yo!

41:52.433 --> 41:57.000
- All right.
Pulse... right away.

42:00.367 --> 42:01.700
- Shake down!

42:11.533 --> 42:13.567
- Fuck! Fuck!

42:19.633 --> 42:21.734
- Let's go, let's go!

42:23.567 --> 42:25.033
- What's this?

42:31.734 --> 42:33.800
- You seem down.

42:35.200 --> 42:36.633
- Yeah.

42:39.300 --> 42:41.333
A guy...

42:43.300 --> 42:44.533
Overdosed.

42:44.533 --> 42:46.867
- Close friend?

42:46.867 --> 42:51.367
- You know, in Oz,

42:51.367 --> 42:54.133
you don't
have friends.

42:54.133 --> 43:00.033
You have people that
look the same as you.

43:00.033 --> 43:02.033
Wolfgang had the Aryans.

43:04.133 --> 43:08.934
And me, well...

43:08.934 --> 43:11.934
I've mostly
been a loner.

43:11.934 --> 43:13.567
- Me too.

43:15.233 --> 43:18.700
It's funny, I used to dread
coming here to visit Wolfgang.

43:20.300 --> 43:22.500
But I don't anymore.

43:38.066 --> 43:40.467
- Merry Christmas,
motherfucker.

43:44.633 --> 43:48.066
- You've had your last meeting
with Cathy Jo Cutler.

43:48.066 --> 43:50.467
The girl is being
talked to right now.

43:50.467 --> 43:52.667
- If you hurt her--
- What?

43:52.667 --> 43:54.900
You'll get your drugged-out
Latino pals to come at me?

43:54.900 --> 43:58.000
- No, no, no, no.
Just you and me, carajo.

43:59.066 --> 44:01.867
- And ruin your chances
for parole,

44:01.867 --> 44:04.100
all because of a cheap,
stupid cunt

44:04.100 --> 44:06.600
who doesn't
know her place?

44:14.867 --> 44:17.066
- I had a little run-in
with the Aryans.

44:17.066 --> 44:19.667
We worked it out.
- Yeah, I can see that.

44:19.667 --> 44:22.934
- Listen, I know you're gonna
want to help, McManus,

44:22.934 --> 44:25.934
but it'd be better for me
and for my parole

44:25.934 --> 44:28.567
if this little incident
just disappeared.

44:28.567 --> 44:30.500
- Miguel.

44:30.500 --> 44:32.834
- Look, the reason
why we fought

44:32.834 --> 44:34.734
ain't gonna
come back again.

44:34.734 --> 44:36.734
Schillinger's
gonna see to that.

44:36.734 --> 44:40.333
Whatever you do,
he's gonna make matters worse.

44:40.333 --> 44:41.967
- Okay.

44:41.967 --> 44:44.934
But the good news is Luis Ruiz
has agreed to see you.

44:44.934 --> 44:46.400
- How did you do that?

44:46.400 --> 44:48.767
- Well, like everything else
in life, took persistence.

44:48.767 --> 44:50.800
- Ah.

45:00.767 --> 45:02.700
- Ouch.

45:02.700 --> 45:04.967
That looks
painful, baby.

45:04.967 --> 45:06.467
- It's okay.

45:06.467 --> 45:09.500
- I've got a new shipment
of d-tabs coming in today.

45:09.500 --> 45:11.133
- So?

45:11.133 --> 45:15.333
- So, since Guerra went whacky,
hacks are making it tougher

45:15.333 --> 45:17.734
for me to move the merchandise
through the system.

45:17.734 --> 45:19.233
I need your help.

45:19.233 --> 45:21.033
Why me?

45:21.033 --> 45:23.066
- McManus trusts you.

45:23.066 --> 45:24.700
- Listen to me.

45:24.700 --> 45:26.767
I don't know how many times
I'm going to have to tell you

45:26.767 --> 45:28.567
until it actually penetrates
that little piñata

45:28.567 --> 45:29.934
you've got for a brain.

45:29.934 --> 45:31.633
I don't want any part
of your bullshit.

45:31.633 --> 45:33.233
- You're so fuckin' sexy.

45:33.233 --> 45:36.834
- Get your hands off of me.
- I like straight boys best.

45:36.834 --> 45:38.433
- You know what?

45:38.433 --> 45:41.667
Here's one straight boy
you ain't gonna bending over.

45:43.133 --> 45:44.900
Leave me alone.

45:47.533 --> 45:50.000
Ugh, that's disgusting.

45:54.133 --> 45:56.233
- Now remember,
if you want to get paroled,

45:56.233 --> 45:59.166
you've got to convince Ruiz
that you're sincere.

45:59.166 --> 46:01.266
Are you ready?
- Yeah.

46:06.500 --> 46:08.400
Hello, Mr.. Ruiz.

46:10.500 --> 46:11.800
- I don't have a lot
of time, Alvarez.

46:11.800 --> 46:13.767
Say what you've got to say.

46:13.767 --> 46:18.433
- Luis, we agreed that you two
would have a conversation,

46:18.433 --> 46:19.967
that you would
spend a few minutes

46:19.967 --> 46:21.133
getting to know
each other.

46:21.133 --> 46:22.767
- Alone.

46:22.767 --> 46:24.333
- Yeah.

46:24.333 --> 46:26.400
Okay, I'll be
right outside.

46:36.667 --> 46:38.467
- Mr. Ruiz.

46:39.700 --> 46:43.100
Sorry I hit you
at the last parole hearing.

46:43.100 --> 46:45.233
- Why are you sorry?

46:45.233 --> 46:47.133
I was an asshole,

46:47.133 --> 46:50.033
deliberately
provoking you

46:50.033 --> 46:52.467
to see if you can
handle yourself.

46:54.166 --> 46:56.200
You failed.

46:56.200 --> 46:58.100
- I know.

46:58.100 --> 47:00.266
But...
- But what, Alvarez?

47:03.000 --> 47:05.834
Sorry don't cut it.

47:05.834 --> 47:08.433
"I've turned myself around,
I said three Hail Marys."

47:08.433 --> 47:09.734
Bullshit.

47:09.734 --> 47:11.433
- It's not bullshit.

47:11.433 --> 47:13.734
I am improving.

47:13.734 --> 47:15.700
- I know you, Alvarez.

47:15.700 --> 47:17.533
I grew up on
the same streets.

47:17.533 --> 47:19.200
I've seen hot-headed
dicks like you

47:19.200 --> 47:21.066
give every Latino
a bad name.

47:22.433 --> 47:25.467
Well, the final score
is this.

47:25.467 --> 47:28.300
You aren't
getting out of Oz,

47:28.300 --> 47:30.600
not in three years,

47:30.600 --> 47:34.400
not in 30, not ever.

47:34.400 --> 47:36.367
Oh, we'll still go
through the procedure,

47:36.367 --> 47:37.967
but that's so each time
your number comes up,

47:37.967 --> 47:41.033
I can see how much
you've ripened.

47:41.033 --> 47:43.367
I'm going to watch
you ripen until you rot.

47:43.367 --> 47:47.200
That's right,
hit me again.

47:48.767 --> 47:50.433
Go on.

48:04.767 --> 48:06.767
- Miguel?

48:06.767 --> 48:08.467
Miguel.

48:24.233 --> 48:26.066
- Guess who's
your new roommate?

48:29.867 --> 48:31.767
I knew you'd
be thrilled.

48:35.000 --> 48:37.967
You want to help me
make my bed, sugar?

48:40.400 --> 48:41.767
- Hey.

48:43.266 --> 48:45.900
Let me
tell you something.

48:45.900 --> 48:49.066
Hey, you may have
wined and dined,

48:49.066 --> 48:53.266
hired and fired,
bought and sold,

48:53.266 --> 48:57.667
and I may have never
done nothing with my life,

48:57.667 --> 49:00.967
but there is no way--

49:00.967 --> 49:02.934
hear me?

49:02.934 --> 49:07.066
No way that I'm ever
going to be your bitch.

49:10.433 --> 49:15.233
- Miguel, dumpling,

49:15.233 --> 49:19.934
I don't want you
to be my bitch.

49:19.934 --> 49:22.700
I have
a little confession.

49:25.133 --> 49:27.200
I'm a virgin.

49:28.834 --> 49:31.166
That's right,

49:31.166 --> 49:35.100
I've never had sex
with man, woman,

49:35.100 --> 49:37.600
fish or foul.

49:39.200 --> 49:43.633
Now, you're thinking,
"I've heard about the orgies."

49:43.633 --> 49:46.100
At my clubs, yes,

49:46.100 --> 49:49.166
my home, quite a scene,

49:49.166 --> 49:52.867
but I myself
never indulge.

49:52.867 --> 49:56.400
I provide
a pleasurable environment,

49:56.400 --> 50:00.066
the necessary ambrosia,

50:00.066 --> 50:03.233
then I let nature
take its course,

50:04.800 --> 50:06.600
and I watch.

50:06.600 --> 50:08.467
- Lights out!

50:15.467 --> 50:18.400
- So I don't want
to fuck you.

50:19.500 --> 50:22.033
That would be
to common.

50:22.033 --> 50:25.400
No, Miguel Alvarez,

50:25.400 --> 50:27.133
I want to be you.

50:30.333 --> 50:34.100
- You want
to be me, huh?

50:34.100 --> 50:37.166
You know what?

50:37.166 --> 50:39.300
You're welcome to it.

50:44.767 --> 50:46.767
I'm so tired.

50:49.934 --> 50:52.100
I'm tired of trying.

50:54.100 --> 50:56.734
I'm tired
of the walls.

51:01.200 --> 51:04.233
The lies,

51:04.233 --> 51:06.166
the fear.

51:11.033 --> 51:12.834
The death.

51:16.400 --> 51:18.200
I'm so tired.

51:23.500 --> 51:26.433
You got one
of those d-tabs?

51:54.133 --> 51:56.066
You want
to party, baby?

51:57.333 --> 51:59.700
Keep them
d-tabs running.

52:12.200 --> 52:14.734
- Here's a story,
and it's true.

52:14.734 --> 52:16.433
The Oregon legislature

52:16.433 --> 52:18.867
passed a law authorizing
the state DOC

52:18.867 --> 52:21.266
to charge inmates
for costs associated

52:21.266 --> 52:23.066
with their imprisonment.

52:23.066 --> 52:26.934
We're talking such
luxury items as medical care,

52:26.934 --> 52:30.000
administrative expenditures,
room and board,

52:30.000 --> 52:33.867
which they estimate
costs $65.00 a day,

52:33.867 --> 52:37.767
or $25,000
a year per prisoner.

52:37.767 --> 52:40.266
Given that Oregon
pays those incarcerated

52:40.266 --> 52:42.633
only $10.80 a week
for work,

52:42.633 --> 52:46.700
you could end up
leaving prison in debt,

52:46.700 --> 52:48.734
and then be forced
to commit a crime, you know,

52:48.734 --> 52:51.066
in order to make restitution
which, of course,

52:51.066 --> 52:52.667
could lead you
back to prison

52:52.667 --> 52:55.300
where you'd have to pay.

52:55.300 --> 52:56.567
Huh.

52:56.567 --> 53:00.500
I guess you'd call that
a vicious circle.

53:02.033 --> 53:03.533
Give it up, boys.

53:04.600 --> 53:07.467
- Sister Pete,
this is Noel Behn

53:07.467 --> 53:09.400
from the society
for prisoners' rights.

53:09.400 --> 53:10.734
- Oh, hello.

53:10.734 --> 53:12.867
- Good to meet you, Sister.
- Come on in.

53:12.867 --> 53:16.867
- I asked Noel here to talk over
the Lemuel Idzik case.

53:16.867 --> 53:18.633
- What's to talk about?

53:18.633 --> 53:19.700
He confessed to
the murder of Omar White,

53:19.700 --> 53:21.300
was sentenced
to death.

53:21.300 --> 53:23.567
- I think the case should be
reviewed by the appeals court.

53:23.567 --> 53:25.033
- Why?

53:25.033 --> 53:26.800
- Idzik's lawyer slept
through most of the trial,

53:26.800 --> 53:28.033
and the judge
said nothing.

53:28.033 --> 53:29.734
- Justice by
assembly line.

53:29.734 --> 53:32.734
- And Idzik
made no protest?

53:32.734 --> 53:34.533
- The man's indifference
to his own fate suggests

53:34.533 --> 53:36.867
some sort of
mental instability.

53:36.867 --> 53:38.667
We'd like you
to determine the extent.

53:40.266 --> 53:42.033
- Well, you know me,

53:42.033 --> 53:43.600
if there's a way to get
somebody out of death row,

53:43.600 --> 53:45.400
I will find it.

53:45.400 --> 53:48.667
- I wanted Omar White
to exterminate me.

53:48.667 --> 53:51.066
When he refused,
I killed him,

53:51.066 --> 53:53.033
knowing
I'd be sent here,

53:53.033 --> 53:55.734
that the State would do
what Omar wouldn't.

53:55.734 --> 53:59.800
- So all of this is an elaborate
way to commit suicide?

53:59.800 --> 54:01.967
- You could say that.

54:01.967 --> 54:06.233
- Is that why you
killed Kareem Said?

54:06.233 --> 54:08.567
- No.

54:08.567 --> 54:11.533
That was revenge.

54:11.533 --> 54:13.500
- Revenge?

54:13.500 --> 54:16.200
What did Kareem Said
do to you?

54:21.900 --> 54:25.700
Lemuel, clearly you have
made a choice to die.

54:25.700 --> 54:30.633
Don't go to your grave without
anyone understanding the reason.

54:30.633 --> 54:34.767
What did Kareem do to you

54:34.767 --> 54:36.433
that was so terrible?

54:36.433 --> 54:39.000
- He bought me
a cup of coffee

54:39.000 --> 54:42.266
at an outdoor cafe
in Istanbul.

54:42.266 --> 54:45.567
That was before
he'd converted to Islam.

54:45.567 --> 54:48.233
He was young,
arrogant,

54:48.233 --> 54:49.967
brilliant.

54:51.333 --> 54:54.900
We had a casual
conversation,

54:54.900 --> 54:58.000
during which he told me
about stardoom,

54:58.000 --> 55:01.967
about...
nightfall,

55:01.967 --> 55:04.500
you know, about how
the universe would end.

55:04.500 --> 55:08.567
He was laughing
about it.

55:10.433 --> 55:13.166
But his words...

55:15.000 --> 55:17.834
Cut into my heart.

55:17.834 --> 55:19.934
His words...

55:19.934 --> 55:23.500
ravaged my soul!

55:23.500 --> 55:26.867
His words...

55:26.867 --> 55:29.533
Killed me!

55:32.200 --> 55:34.133
- And you killed him.

55:35.300 --> 55:37.266
- Bizarre, isn't it,

55:37.266 --> 55:38.867
how one man's
chatty conversation,

55:38.867 --> 55:43.533
how one man's laughter
can level someone else.

55:43.533 --> 55:46.033
When he walked away
from that table,

55:46.033 --> 55:48.066
he probably forgot
about what we discussed.

55:48.066 --> 55:51.033
He certainly
forgot who I was.

55:51.033 --> 55:55.800
It was a moment, you know,
one of many for him.

55:55.800 --> 55:59.934
But for me, it was the most
significant moment of my life.

56:03.500 --> 56:08.900
And I can't help think
that by shooting Kareem Said,

56:08.900 --> 56:12.133
I kept myself from doing
something far worse.

56:14.100 --> 56:16.300
- The death sentence
of Lemuel Idzik,

56:16.300 --> 56:17.667
convicted of killing
a fellow inmate

56:17.667 --> 56:19.133
at the Oswald
correctional facility

56:19.133 --> 56:20.467
was overturned today.

56:20.467 --> 56:23.300
- What?
- Motherfucker!

56:42.100 --> 56:44.000
- Come in.

56:45.967 --> 56:47.734
Come in.

56:53.500 --> 56:55.467
Listen...

56:55.467 --> 56:58.166
I know you
want to die.

56:58.166 --> 57:02.567
The irony is, in Em City
you probably will,

57:02.567 --> 57:06.233
shanked, suffocated...

57:06.233 --> 57:08.433
OD'd.

57:10.433 --> 57:14.834
You know,
I was remembering

57:14.834 --> 57:18.000
at Leo Glynn's funeral

57:18.000 --> 57:21.800
why I built this place,

57:21.800 --> 57:26.166
why I wanted to create
a better life for these guys.

57:28.967 --> 57:31.700
It's because
most likely,

57:31.700 --> 57:34.633
they'll never have
any other kind of life.

57:38.367 --> 57:41.834
I've heard all about
your doomsday scenarios.

57:44.333 --> 57:47.166
The sun will cool,
the planets will darken,

57:47.166 --> 57:49.100
man will
become extinct.

57:50.834 --> 57:54.533
Well, I say,
okay, so what?

57:54.533 --> 57:57.867
That won't happen for another
10 billion years or so.

57:57.867 --> 57:59.934
We're alive now.

57:59.934 --> 58:02.867
I mean,
we live in the now.

58:02.867 --> 58:06.400
We have to grab the now
with both hands.

58:06.400 --> 58:09.266
We have to move
through the light,

58:09.266 --> 58:12.100
be warmed by the sun

58:12.100 --> 58:13.700
while we can.

58:13.700 --> 58:16.033
- And what about
the darkness?

58:19.000 --> 58:20.967
- Shit, I don't know.

58:23.166 --> 58:28.467
I mean, someone or something
set this whole thing spinning.

58:28.467 --> 58:29.834
I've got to believe

58:29.834 --> 58:32.300
that there's
a reason that we live

58:32.300 --> 58:34.700
and a reason
that we leave.

58:38.400 --> 58:41.767
- To believe is to live,
Mr. McManus.

58:43.734 --> 58:45.967
Consider
yourself lucky.

58:49.767 --> 58:53.533
- Some days I do.

59:03.367 --> 59:05.200
- Yo.

59:05.200 --> 59:07.600
- Dad's coming to visit?

59:07.600 --> 59:09.600
- Well, not visit,

59:09.600 --> 59:11.166
exactly.

59:16.400 --> 59:18.967
- Hey, yo, Dad, check it out.
Look at that, huh?

59:18.967 --> 59:22.600
Look at me
and my new best friend.

59:22.600 --> 59:24.834
- Don't use me
to taunt your father.

59:24.834 --> 59:26.600
- Why not, man?
You hate him as much as I do.

59:26.600 --> 59:28.333
- No, I never knew the man.

59:28.333 --> 59:30.567
I just heard the stories
from your mom.

59:30.567 --> 59:32.000
- Yeah, well, she's just
got the abridged version.

59:32.000 --> 59:34.266
I've got 35 years
of gory details.

59:35.300 --> 59:37.734
You fuckin' asshole.

59:37.734 --> 59:40.133
What's that word called for
when a son kills his father?

59:40.133 --> 59:42.200
- Patricide.

59:42.200 --> 59:44.233
- Yeah, patricide.

59:44.233 --> 59:46.100
I like
the sound of that.

59:56.367 --> 59:59.700
- You always did
look good in gray.

59:59.700 --> 1:00:01.700
- What do you want,
slut?

1:00:04.333 --> 1:00:06.033
- I assume you've
heard that Cyril's

1:00:06.033 --> 1:00:08.266
latest appeal
was denied.

1:00:08.266 --> 1:00:11.867
- Yeah, he fries
on Sunday.

1:00:11.867 --> 1:00:14.700
- Sheamus, I want you
to visit him.

1:00:14.700 --> 1:00:17.400
I want you to tell Cyril
how much you loved him.

1:00:17.400 --> 1:00:20.133
- You mean lie?

1:00:20.133 --> 1:00:22.066
- That's something you've
always been good at.

1:00:22.066 --> 1:00:25.300
- What do I get
in return?

1:00:25.300 --> 1:00:28.734
-  The peace of mind
that your son

1:00:28.734 --> 1:00:31.133
went to his death
with a little comfort.

1:00:31.133 --> 1:00:33.633
- I'll leave
the hand-holding to you.

1:00:33.633 --> 1:00:35.867
He'll get
no comfort from me.

1:00:38.100 --> 1:00:40.367
- Forget the beatings,

1:00:40.367 --> 1:00:43.333
forget the verbal abuse
growing up.

1:00:43.333 --> 1:00:46.700
Let's just focus on the
electroshock therapy, shall we?

1:00:46.700 --> 1:00:48.166
Putting Cyril
through all that torment--

1:00:48.166 --> 1:00:49.433
- They said it was
the best treatment.

1:00:49.433 --> 1:00:51.066
- Oh, I am sure
that was your concern.

1:00:51.066 --> 1:00:52.567
- Fuck you!

1:00:52.567 --> 1:00:54.467
- You know,
the saddest thing, Sheamus,

1:00:54.467 --> 1:00:56.800
is that you had
two wonderful sons

1:00:56.800 --> 1:00:58.567
and you destroyed
them both.

1:00:58.567 --> 1:01:00.500
When you die,

1:01:00.500 --> 1:01:02.734
when you're looking
for a little comfort,

1:01:02.734 --> 1:01:06.500
there will be no one
there who gives a shit.

1:01:12.934 --> 1:01:15.900
- Why don't you go suck off
your nigga boyfriend?

1:01:30.934 --> 1:01:33.633
- Hey, Skillinger.
- Schillinger.

1:01:33.633 --> 1:01:35.533
- Sorry.

1:01:35.533 --> 1:01:37.734
I got a job
needs to be done,

1:01:37.734 --> 1:01:39.567
and I got the cash
to pay for it.

1:01:39.567 --> 1:01:41.100
- Yeah, what job?

1:01:41.100 --> 1:01:43.433
- Kill Jahfree Neema.

1:01:43.433 --> 1:01:45.000
- No, thanks.

1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:48.033
- I said I can pay!

1:01:48.033 --> 1:01:51.367
- Yeah.
And I said no.

1:01:51.367 --> 1:01:53.200
Why don't you get your boy
Ryan to do the deed?

1:01:53.200 --> 1:01:56.066
- Come on, Skillinger--
- It's Schillinger!

1:01:56.066 --> 1:01:58.100
Just move
the fuck on.

1:02:02.500 --> 1:02:04.367
Seven-card bill.

1:02:12.867 --> 1:02:16.066
- Hello there,
brother man.

1:02:16.066 --> 1:02:18.967
- O'Reily, I got
no quarrel with you.

1:02:18.967 --> 1:02:22.166
- Oh, yes, you do.

1:02:24.967 --> 1:02:27.867
Oh!

1:02:27.867 --> 1:02:30.233
- Hey!
Get off, get off!

1:02:30.233 --> 1:02:33.300
Get off!
Fuck, Jesus Christ!

1:02:38.100 --> 1:02:40.066
- we're almost finished.

1:02:41.433 --> 1:02:45.400
There we go.
Okay.

1:02:45.400 --> 1:02:48.066
Still, I'm keeping you here
until we take the stitches out.

1:03:05.900 --> 1:03:09.000
- Guess you're not as quick
as you used to be, huh, dad?

1:03:09.000 --> 1:03:11.300
- Get the fuck
away from me.

1:03:11.300 --> 1:03:14.867
- Hey, pal, I got no interest
in changing your bed pan.

1:03:14.867 --> 1:03:16.233
I just thought
you should know

1:03:16.233 --> 1:03:18.367
that tomorrow's
Cyril's execution,

1:03:18.367 --> 1:03:20.800
and so far the courts
refuse to step in.

1:03:23.467 --> 1:03:24.600
- Mm-hmm.

1:03:26.233 --> 1:03:28.600
- You really don't
give a shit, do you?

1:03:28.600 --> 1:03:31.967
- I don't give a shit about
anything I can't control.

1:03:31.967 --> 1:03:33.834
- Then you must not
care about anything.

1:03:33.834 --> 1:03:36.533
- Will you get
the fuck away from me?

1:03:36.533 --> 1:03:38.834
- Ryan!
- Yo.

1:03:38.834 --> 1:03:40.233
- Come here, please.

1:03:46.300 --> 1:03:49.166
- You tell me you want to be
an orderly to help people?

1:03:49.166 --> 1:03:50.900
- Not him.

1:03:50.900 --> 1:03:54.400
Hey, tomorrow Cyril's
going to die, all right?

1:03:54.400 --> 1:03:56.567
You can trace back all the shit
that's come down

1:03:56.567 --> 1:03:59.500
and dear ole fuckin' dad
is at the center.

1:03:59.500 --> 1:04:02.166
- Maybe so, but that still
doesn't justify

1:04:02.166 --> 1:04:03.633
what you're plotting, Ryan,

1:04:03.633 --> 1:04:06.200
no more than it did when
you had Cyril kill my husband.

1:04:09.867 --> 1:04:13.333
I watch you
care for your brother.

1:04:14.700 --> 1:04:19.500
And you're so warm
and so sweet with him,

1:04:19.500 --> 1:04:22.667
and then you get this
look in your eye--

1:04:22.667 --> 1:04:25.266
this dangerous,
terrifying look.

1:04:28.600 --> 1:04:31.567
There are moments
when I forgive you

1:04:31.567 --> 1:04:34.100
for what you've done,

1:04:34.100 --> 1:04:36.300
and others
when I can't.

1:04:36.300 --> 1:04:39.800
And I want to
forgive you, Ryan.

1:04:42.033 --> 1:04:43.867
Help me to do that.

1:04:45.800 --> 1:04:47.300
- How?

1:04:47.300 --> 1:04:51.200
- Promise me that no harm
will come to your father.

1:04:51.200 --> 1:04:53.000
Please.

1:04:56.433 --> 1:04:59.533
Let's just both put
the past in the past.

1:05:18.300 --> 1:05:21.000
- Here's a story,
and...

1:05:21.000 --> 1:05:22.767
It's true.

1:05:22.767 --> 1:05:25.734
Last year, the United States
Supreme Court Justice

1:05:25.734 --> 1:05:29.467
Antonin Scalia criticized
the Catholic Church's opposition

1:05:29.467 --> 1:05:31.000
to the death penalty.

1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:32.867
He believes
Catholic judges

1:05:32.867 --> 1:05:34.934
who don't support
capital punishment

1:05:34.934 --> 1:05:36.400
should resign.

1:05:36.400 --> 1:05:40.133
A devout Catholic himself,
Scalia has not demanded

1:05:40.133 --> 1:05:42.200
judges who support
the church's stand

1:05:42.200 --> 1:05:44.767
on abortion
should resign.

1:05:52.700 --> 1:05:56.033
- Lopresti told me
Dad got stabbed.

1:05:56.033 --> 1:05:57.934
- Don't worry about Dad.

1:06:00.500 --> 1:06:02.233
- Is he gonna be okay?

1:06:02.233 --> 1:06:04.266
- Dr. Nathan's taking
good care of him.

1:06:05.800 --> 1:06:07.967
- I like Dr. Nathan.

1:06:07.967 --> 1:06:10.834
- Me too.
Me too.

1:06:16.033 --> 1:06:18.166
- That man's
taking notes again.

1:06:18.166 --> 1:06:19.467
- I told you,

1:06:19.467 --> 1:06:21.467
that's because this time
you're going to get

1:06:21.467 --> 1:06:23.633
that special
ECT treatment.

1:06:23.633 --> 1:06:27.433
- Right. Finally.

1:06:27.433 --> 1:06:30.100
- Show time.

1:06:31.700 --> 1:06:33.734
Any word from
the lawyer?

1:06:51.300 --> 1:06:52.934
See ya, Ryan.

1:06:57.667 --> 1:07:00.066
- Yeah, I'll see ya.

1:07:10.633 --> 1:07:12.800
- "Yea, though I walk
through the valley

1:07:12.800 --> 1:07:15.400
"of the shadow of death,
I will fear now evil,

1:07:15.400 --> 1:07:17.200
"for thou art with me.

1:07:17.200 --> 1:07:20.000
"Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:22.200
"Thou preparest
a table before me

1:07:22.200 --> 1:07:24.200
in the presence
of mine enemies.

1:07:24.200 --> 1:07:26.567
Thou anointeth
my head with oil."

1:07:39.800 --> 1:07:42.233
- "My life, and I will dwell
in the house of the Lord,

1:07:42.233 --> 1:07:43.700
forever."

1:09:10.767 --> 1:09:13.300
- Mom?
Mom?

1:09:16.166 --> 1:09:19.133
Mom, what's happening?

1:09:19.133 --> 1:09:23.667
Mom, what's--
what are they doing?

1:09:23.667 --> 1:09:25.600
Ryan!

1:09:32.633 --> 1:09:35.834
Ryan, Ryan!

1:10:16.367 --> 1:10:17.900
- Ryan.

1:10:17.900 --> 1:10:19.667
Ryan.

1:10:23.533 --> 1:10:25.734
- I want to see Cyril.

1:10:28.100 --> 1:10:29.900
- You're too late.

1:10:40.233 --> 1:10:43.867
- I did the best
I could for him,

1:10:43.867 --> 1:10:47.400
and you, growing up.

1:10:47.400 --> 1:10:50.233
I tried!

1:10:50.233 --> 1:10:52.066
But I never
caught a break.

1:10:52.066 --> 1:10:56.700
Nothing ever went my way,
not one single time.

1:10:59.967 --> 1:11:02.400
And the day that...

1:11:02.400 --> 1:11:06.233
Your sister...

1:11:06.233 --> 1:11:09.000
died...

1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:13.266
was the day I found out
that Tessie had cancer.

1:11:16.567 --> 1:11:18.266
I was scared.

1:11:22.734 --> 1:11:25.367
- You were afraid?
- Yeah.

1:11:26.367 --> 1:11:28.100
I don't want to die.

1:11:31.900 --> 1:11:36.066
Don't leave me, Ryan,
please, son.

1:11:39.066 --> 1:11:41.533
I don't want to die alone.

1:11:44.233 --> 1:11:45.667
Please.

1:12:03.033 --> 1:12:05.266
- Don't worry.

1:12:05.266 --> 1:12:07.900
I won't let
that happen.

1:12:07.900 --> 1:12:10.367
I'm not going
anywhere, Dad.

1:12:21.734 --> 1:12:24.066
- Uh, is everybody ready?

1:12:26.834 --> 1:12:31.967
James would like
to address everybody.

1:12:36.567 --> 1:12:38.200
- Well...

1:12:40.333 --> 1:12:44.633
What I have
to say is goodbye.

1:12:44.633 --> 1:12:49.033
As of today, I'll be
transferring to Unit F.

1:12:49.033 --> 1:12:51.633
See, I'm HIV positive.

1:12:53.767 --> 1:12:59.533
Initially I blamed Cutler,
the guy who raped me,

1:12:59.533 --> 1:13:02.300
but the truth is,

1:13:02.300 --> 1:13:05.166
this is my fault,

1:13:05.166 --> 1:13:09.367
because all the times
I had unprotected sex,

1:13:09.367 --> 1:13:12.400
thinking
I'd never be the one

1:13:12.400 --> 1:13:14.967
to catch my dick
in the zipper.

1:13:17.467 --> 1:13:22.233
And even though I know
I'm going to live a long time,

1:13:22.233 --> 1:13:25.200
I also know

1:13:25.200 --> 1:13:27.433
this didn't
have to happen.

1:13:32.500 --> 1:13:34.266
Anyway,

1:13:34.266 --> 1:13:37.500
I'm glad I got to spend
some time with you guys,

1:13:37.500 --> 1:13:40.834
to see through
the window both ways.

1:13:52.200 --> 1:13:54.467
- What the fuck
are you doing here?

1:13:54.467 --> 1:13:55.900
- Believe me, Vern,

1:13:55.900 --> 1:13:58.033
I wouldn't have come
unless I absolutely had to.

1:13:58.033 --> 1:14:00.133
- How's the kike?

1:14:00.133 --> 1:14:03.133
- Irv's fine,
sends his love.

1:14:05.734 --> 1:14:07.600
- Dad's dying.

1:14:07.600 --> 1:14:10.367
Lung cancer.

1:14:10.367 --> 1:14:14.700
All those Chesterfields
finally caught up with him.

1:14:14.700 --> 1:14:16.700
He goes in and out
of consciousness,

1:14:16.700 --> 1:14:18.600
but when he's awake,
he asks for you.

1:14:20.467 --> 1:14:22.367
-  Horse shit.

1:14:24.967 --> 1:14:27.533
- You and I haven't been in
the same room for 20-odd years,

1:14:27.533 --> 1:14:28.767
but I felt I should come,

1:14:28.767 --> 1:14:31.400
see if you had a message
for the old man.

1:14:31.400 --> 1:14:32.734
- Message?

1:14:37.633 --> 1:14:40.133
I've hated him
all my life.

1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:48.066
- Well, no reason
to stop now.

1:14:49.300 --> 1:14:54.033
I have been corresponding
with Carrie's folks in Montana,

1:14:54.033 --> 1:14:55.800
sending money
for the baby.

1:14:55.800 --> 1:14:58.533
They mailed me pictures
of Jewel's first birthday.

1:14:58.533 --> 1:15:00.133
I thought you
might like them.

1:15:02.934 --> 1:15:04.333
- Greta...

1:15:06.066 --> 1:15:08.800
What I did,

1:15:08.800 --> 1:15:11.333
shutting you out
after your wedding,

1:15:11.333 --> 1:15:13.333
I had to.

1:15:15.233 --> 1:15:18.867
- And I despised you
for decades,

1:15:18.867 --> 1:15:24.633
but now all
I can say is shalom.

1:15:24.633 --> 1:15:27.200
Shalom, Vern.

1:15:40.400 --> 1:15:42.300
- Agent Taylor.

1:15:42.300 --> 1:15:45.433
- Mr. Beecher,
please sit down.

1:15:50.433 --> 1:15:52.800
How's it going?

1:15:52.800 --> 1:15:54.333
- Fine.

1:15:56.934 --> 1:15:59.700
- How's your daughter,
Holly?

1:15:59.700 --> 1:16:02.000
You know,
the reason I ask is

1:16:02.000 --> 1:16:04.934
one of the few joys
of this job

1:16:04.934 --> 1:16:08.233
is reuniting kidnapped children
with their parents.

1:16:09.800 --> 1:16:13.200
- She's adjusting,
all things considered.

1:16:15.233 --> 1:16:17.834
- It must be tough on her,
though--I mean,

1:16:17.834 --> 1:16:20.233
you out of prison one day,
back inside the next.

1:16:21.700 --> 1:16:24.266
How would you like another
chance at being paroled?

1:16:24.266 --> 1:16:27.533
I can make it happen.

1:16:27.533 --> 1:16:29.000
- How?

1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:31.400
- If you cooperate with us
we'll see to it

1:16:31.400 --> 1:16:33.467
that this latest charge
against you evaporates.

1:16:33.467 --> 1:16:35.800
- If this is about Keller
murdering Brice Tibbetts--

1:16:35.800 --> 1:16:37.333
- That's a dead issue.

1:16:37.333 --> 1:16:39.300
But Keller did kill
two other men,

1:16:39.300 --> 1:16:41.066
Byam Lewis
and Mark Carocci.

1:16:41.066 --> 1:16:42.867
And Keller's
got an ego,

1:16:42.867 --> 1:16:45.266
and I'm sure that in some point
in your time together,

1:16:45.266 --> 1:16:46.800
he must have
mentioned something.

1:16:46.800 --> 1:16:49.433
- You mean come out
and admitted his guilt?

1:16:49.433 --> 1:16:52.800
No, he's too sly for that.

1:16:52.800 --> 1:16:55.200
- But he suggested
his complicity.

1:16:58.834 --> 1:17:00.133
- Yes.

1:17:00.133 --> 1:17:02.667
- You see,
that could be enough,

1:17:02.667 --> 1:17:05.500
if you and I figure out
how to phrase it correctly.

1:17:05.500 --> 1:17:07.967
-  Like you did
with Jerry Heeken?

1:17:07.967 --> 1:17:10.000
- Heeken's a punk.

1:17:10.000 --> 1:17:12.700
But you're a former lawyer
with children.

1:17:12.700 --> 1:17:14.900
- That Keller
fucked up the ass.

1:17:14.900 --> 1:17:17.066
- You're back in Oz
because of him.

1:17:17.066 --> 1:17:19.400
You testify,
you go free.

1:17:19.400 --> 1:17:22.200
He dies.

1:17:22.200 --> 1:17:24.300
- What is it
about Keller,

1:17:24.300 --> 1:17:26.333
Agent Taylor,
that obsesses you?

1:17:28.000 --> 1:17:30.200
- I want justice
for those murdered men.

1:17:33.200 --> 1:17:34.900
- Look, I may have
been disbarred,

1:17:34.900 --> 1:17:36.300
but there's still enough
lawyer in me to know

1:17:36.300 --> 1:17:37.800
that justice doesn't
come through deceit

1:17:37.800 --> 1:17:39.867
by my rephrasing
what Keller said.

1:17:39.867 --> 1:17:40.867
- He's guilty!

1:17:40.867 --> 1:17:42.033
- I know.

1:17:42.033 --> 1:17:44.066
- Freedom, Beecher.

1:17:44.066 --> 1:17:46.934
Tucking your little girl,
Holly, in at night.

1:17:51.066 --> 1:17:53.033
- Oh, that's a nice touch.
- What's that?

1:17:53.033 --> 1:17:55.233
- Making sure he saw us
talking together.

1:17:55.233 --> 1:17:57.300
- Will you cooperate?

1:18:05.266 --> 1:18:06.734
I have to think about it.

1:18:06.734 --> 1:18:08.567
- Well, don't
take too long.

1:18:08.567 --> 1:18:10.433
Now, that he's seen us
chatting together,

1:18:10.433 --> 1:18:11.867
he'll start to sweat,

1:18:11.867 --> 1:18:14.033
wondering whether you're
going to give him up or not.

1:18:14.033 --> 1:18:18.433
To guarantee your silence,
he might do something nasty.

1:18:18.433 --> 1:18:20.467
- So the little stroll
wasn't to scare him,

1:18:20.467 --> 1:18:22.467
it was to scare me.

1:18:22.467 --> 1:18:25.767
Jesus, you cover
every angle, don't you?

1:18:27.567 --> 1:18:29.266
- I try.

1:18:35.900 --> 1:18:40.467
- Now look,
tonight's your big premiere,

1:18:40.467 --> 1:18:43.500
and Beecher's
big finale.

1:18:43.500 --> 1:18:46.500
I've got a little
opening night present for you.

1:18:46.500 --> 1:18:49.166
Right before
your fight scene,

1:18:49.166 --> 1:18:53.166
instead of handing
you the prop knife,

1:18:53.166 --> 1:18:55.200
I'm gonna give you
a real one.

1:18:56.367 --> 1:18:58.500
You get to stab
that sucker right there

1:18:58.500 --> 1:19:00.834
on stage in front
of everybody.

1:19:00.834 --> 1:19:04.500
And all we say is, like,

1:19:04.500 --> 1:19:06.533
"It was an accident."

1:19:09.367 --> 1:19:11.300
- So, if I tell Taylor
what he wants to hear,

1:19:11.300 --> 1:19:13.400
I'll be home
in a matter of weeks

1:19:13.400 --> 1:19:16.667
while Keller heads
back to death row,

1:19:16.667 --> 1:19:19.400
marking off
the calendar.

1:19:19.400 --> 1:19:23.166
- And all you have to do
is subvert the truth.

1:19:23.166 --> 1:19:24.967
The question is...

1:19:24.967 --> 1:19:26.934
can you live the rest
of your life knowing

1:19:26.934 --> 1:19:29.066
it was built on a lie?

1:19:29.066 --> 1:19:32.700
- But it's not
a lie exactly.

1:19:32.700 --> 1:19:35.100
I mean,
Keller is guilty.

1:19:35.100 --> 1:19:37.900
- Yes, but it hasn't
been proven.

1:19:37.900 --> 1:19:39.467
Your saying that
he said something

1:19:39.467 --> 1:19:40.867
he didn't say
is not proof.

1:19:40.867 --> 1:19:44.200
Tobias, we live
in a nation of laws,

1:19:44.200 --> 1:19:45.934
some of which
are inspired

1:19:45.934 --> 1:19:47.367
and some of which
are just lousy.

1:19:47.367 --> 1:19:50.734
But we can't
abandon our moral code

1:19:50.734 --> 1:19:53.100
whenever
it's convenient.

1:19:53.100 --> 1:19:56.033
Then we might as well
just open all the gates

1:19:56.033 --> 1:19:57.533
of all the prisons.

1:20:01.066 --> 1:20:03.633
- I want to be
with my children.

1:20:06.700 --> 1:20:09.800
- My dear Tobias,

1:20:09.800 --> 1:20:12.667
in all my years
sitting across that desk,

1:20:12.667 --> 1:20:15.300
I have learned
one thing.

1:20:15.300 --> 1:20:17.800
Most people who come
to me with a problem

1:20:17.800 --> 1:20:21.500
have already made up their minds
how they'll proceed.

1:20:21.500 --> 1:20:24.333
They're just here hoping
I'll agree with them,

1:20:24.333 --> 1:20:27.266
hoping I'll make them
feel better.

1:20:27.266 --> 1:20:29.834
I can't do that with you.

1:20:33.500 --> 1:20:35.467
I gotta go.

1:20:35.467 --> 1:20:37.333
Tonight's opening
night of "Macbeth."

1:20:37.333 --> 1:20:39.133
I have to get ready.

1:20:56.233 --> 1:20:58.266
Miguel,
are you okay?

1:20:58.266 --> 1:21:01.166
- Just a little
opening night jitters,

1:21:01.166 --> 1:21:03.700
a little cotton--
cotton mouth.

1:21:03.700 --> 1:21:05.867
- Okay.
You set?

1:21:05.867 --> 1:21:07.266
- Let's make
theatrical history.

1:21:07.266 --> 1:21:09.233
- All right.
You guys ready?

1:21:09.233 --> 1:21:11.500
- I'm so excited
I'm gonna bust my buttons.

1:21:11.500 --> 1:21:13.233
- Don't do that,
it's a rental.

1:21:13.233 --> 1:21:15.100
All right, everybody,
we worked hard,

1:21:15.100 --> 1:21:16.867
so now's the time
to have fun.

1:21:16.867 --> 1:21:18.734
So, if you flub a line,
just keep going.

1:21:18.734 --> 1:21:21.533
If you miss a cue,
don't panic.

1:21:21.533 --> 1:21:23.567
I'm very proud
of all of you.

1:21:23.567 --> 1:21:25.333
Break a leg.

1:21:28.800 --> 1:21:30.734
- Have a good show,
Beecher.

1:21:36.834 --> 1:21:39.266
- Miguel,
dim the house lights.

1:21:54.066 --> 1:21:55.367
Good evening,

1:21:55.367 --> 1:21:56.934
and welcome
to the premiere production

1:21:56.934 --> 1:21:58.834
of the Oswald players.

1:21:58.834 --> 1:22:02.033
Before we begin, there are
a few changes in the program.

1:22:02.033 --> 1:22:05.700
The second Weird Sister
will be played by Reggie Rawls

1:22:05.700 --> 1:22:07.433
instead of
Chico Guerra.

1:22:07.433 --> 1:22:09.767
Banquo will be played
by Tom Smeeding

1:22:09.767 --> 1:22:11.734
instead of
Agamemnon Busmalis.

1:22:11.734 --> 1:22:14.333
And Norman Duttweiler
will play King Duncan

1:22:14.333 --> 1:22:16.433
instead of
Burr Redding.

1:22:16.433 --> 1:22:19.533
I would also like to say
that Warden Leo Glynn

1:22:19.533 --> 1:22:22.533
was a great supporter
of bringing the arts to Oz,

1:22:22.533 --> 1:22:25.500
and so, we dedicate
tonight's performance

1:22:25.500 --> 1:22:27.767
in his memory,

1:22:27.767 --> 1:22:31.066
and also to the memory
of Cyril O'Reily.

1:22:31.066 --> 1:22:32.734
Thank you.

1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:43.400
They spent some money
on this shit.

1:22:47.300 --> 1:22:49.467
- When shall we three
meet again?

1:22:49.467 --> 1:22:52.567
In thunder,
lightning or in rain?

1:22:52.567 --> 1:22:55.066
- When the hurlyburly's done,

1:22:55.066 --> 1:22:57.767
when the battle's lost and won.

1:22:57.767 --> 1:23:00.934
- That will be
the set of sun.

1:23:00.934 --> 1:23:03.900
- Where the place?
- Upon the heath.

1:23:03.900 --> 1:23:06.633
There to meet with Macbeth.

1:23:11.066 --> 1:23:13.767
- Everlasting bonfire...

1:23:13.767 --> 1:23:16.867
- Anon! Anon!

1:23:16.867 --> 1:23:20.133
I pray you, remember
the porter!

1:23:24.734 --> 1:23:26.500
- Hie thee hither,

1:23:26.500 --> 1:23:30.000
that I may pour
my spirits in thine ear

1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:33.400
and chastise with
the valor of my tongue

1:23:33.400 --> 1:23:36.233
all that impedes thee
from the golden round

1:23:36.233 --> 1:23:38.700
which fate
and metaphysical aid...

1:23:38.700 --> 1:23:40.033
- Miguel.

1:23:40.033 --> 1:23:42.300
- Doth seem to have
three crowned withal.

1:23:47.533 --> 1:23:50.100
- what is thy name?

1:23:50.100 --> 1:23:52.967
- Thou'lt be afraid
to hear it.

1:23:52.967 --> 1:23:56.066
- No, though thy callest
thyself a hotter name,

1:23:56.066 --> 1:23:58.200
than any is in hell.

1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:03.700
- My name's Macbeth.

1:24:21.400 --> 1:24:24.467
- Toby, I've got a plan,
a way to get Schillinger

1:24:24.467 --> 1:24:25.767
out of our lives
forever.

1:24:25.767 --> 1:24:26.867
- I don't want to hear it.

1:24:26.867 --> 1:24:29.133
- Toby--
- Just give me my prop.

1:24:47.567 --> 1:24:50.967
- Thou was born of women,
but swords I smile at,

1:24:50.967 --> 1:24:53.233
weapons laugh to scorn,

1:24:53.233 --> 1:24:56.533
brandished by man
that's of a woman born.

1:24:56.533 --> 1:24:58.133
- Turn!

1:24:58.133 --> 1:24:59.934
Hellhound, turn!

1:25:01.767 --> 1:25:05.333
- Of all men else
I have avoided thee.

1:25:06.800 --> 1:25:08.800
But get thee back.

1:25:08.800 --> 1:25:12.166
My soul is too much charged
with blood of thine already.

1:25:12.166 --> 1:25:14.033
- I have no words.

1:25:14.033 --> 1:25:16.266
My voice is in my sword,

1:25:16.266 --> 1:25:19.367
thou bloodier villain
than terms can give thee out.

1:25:19.367 --> 1:25:21.567
man: Stick him, stick him!

1:25:27.533 --> 1:25:29.333
- You're a dead man,
sweetpea.

1:25:35.700 --> 1:25:39.433
That cocksucker.

1:25:49.266 --> 1:25:50.333
- Dr. Nathan!

1:25:50.333 --> 1:25:52.133
- That motherfucker's dead.

1:25:59.300 --> 1:26:03.400
- Hey, get back!
Get the fuck back!

1:26:03.400 --> 1:26:04.834
- As you know,
we're investigating

1:26:04.834 --> 1:26:06.867
what happened on the stage.

1:26:06.867 --> 1:26:09.266
Trying to determine
whether Schillinger's death

1:26:09.266 --> 1:26:11.667
was accidental
or intentional.

1:26:11.667 --> 1:26:13.567
- Chris Keller says
he handed you the knife

1:26:13.567 --> 1:26:15.700
just before your entrance.

1:26:15.700 --> 1:26:18.066
- How did a real knife
get on the prop table?

1:26:18.066 --> 1:26:19.867
- I don't know.

1:26:19.867 --> 1:26:22.100
- Suzanne Fitzgerald says
there were no problems

1:26:22.100 --> 1:26:23.467
during the rehearsals.

1:26:23.467 --> 1:26:25.600
- Schillinger and Keller
seemed very friendly.

1:26:25.600 --> 1:26:28.133
They were horsing around
and stuff.

1:26:28.133 --> 1:26:29.667
- What about Beecher?

1:26:29.667 --> 1:26:31.500
- He--he seemed fine.

1:26:31.500 --> 1:26:35.633
Distant, but not in
the least bit confrontational.

1:26:35.633 --> 1:26:37.800
- All of which jibes
with the statement you made

1:26:37.800 --> 1:26:40.567
immediately after
you stabbed Schillinger.

1:26:40.567 --> 1:26:43.400
Do you have anything
to add at this time?

1:26:43.400 --> 1:26:45.433
- No, sir.

1:26:45.433 --> 1:26:46.967
- Okay.

1:26:46.967 --> 1:26:50.467
We've decided to rule
that Schillinger's death

1:26:50.467 --> 1:26:52.533
was accidental.

1:26:52.533 --> 1:26:54.967
- You're coming back
to Em City.

1:26:57.200 --> 1:26:58.834
- Thank you.

1:26:59.800 --> 1:27:01.233
Thank you, all.

1:27:18.367 --> 1:27:19.900
What are you
doing here?

1:27:19.900 --> 1:27:22.333
- I asked Querns
to transfer me back.

1:27:22.333 --> 1:27:24.200
I guess he
convinced McManus.

1:27:24.200 --> 1:27:27.333
Even made us roomies.

1:27:27.333 --> 1:27:29.900
- No.
- Yeah.

1:27:29.900 --> 1:27:32.500
- Nothing's changed, Chris.

1:27:32.500 --> 1:27:35.166
- I know, you've got
the top bunk just like before.

1:27:35.166 --> 1:27:38.700
- I mean my feelings
haven't changed.

1:27:40.133 --> 1:27:41.367
I'm gonna
go to McManus,

1:27:41.367 --> 1:27:42.734
ask him to move me
to another pod,

1:27:42.734 --> 1:27:44.066
- Toby.
- Move me to Gen Pop.

1:27:44.066 --> 1:27:45.400
- Toby, goddamn it.

1:27:45.400 --> 1:27:47.400
- Look, will you get it
through your head,

1:27:47.400 --> 1:27:49.867
I don't want you
in my life.

1:27:52.000 --> 1:27:54.133
- After everything
I've done for you.

1:27:54.133 --> 1:27:57.233
- Yeah, like almost getting me
sent to death row.

1:27:57.233 --> 1:27:58.500
- Hey, if it weren't
for me, pal,

1:27:58.500 --> 1:27:59.967
you'd be in the morgue
instead of Schillinger.

1:27:59.967 --> 1:28:02.700
- Maybe.
- Yeah.

1:28:02.700 --> 1:28:05.100
- But if you think I got any
satisfaction out of killing him,

1:28:05.100 --> 1:28:07.000
you're wrong.

1:28:07.000 --> 1:28:08.834
You don't know
me at all.

1:28:08.834 --> 1:28:11.000
- I don't know you?

1:28:11.000 --> 1:28:13.266
I know you're free
of that Nazi fuck.

1:28:16.667 --> 1:28:18.300
- No, I'm not.

1:28:19.767 --> 1:28:22.100
No more free than
I am of his two sons,

1:28:22.100 --> 1:28:26.600
or Metzger
or Cathy Rockwell.

1:28:33.867 --> 1:28:37.166
Chris, after six years
in this place,

1:28:37.166 --> 1:28:41.066
I'm not sure about
anything anymore.

1:28:41.066 --> 1:28:44.500
Heaven, justice...

1:28:44.500 --> 1:28:47.967
Truth.

1:28:47.967 --> 1:28:53.200
The only thing I believe in
is life.

1:28:53.200 --> 1:28:55.166
Every life
is precious.

1:28:55.166 --> 1:28:56.734
Not just
yours or mine,

1:28:56.734 --> 1:28:59.700
but every single person
on the planet who's breathing,

1:28:59.700 --> 1:29:03.600
their lives
are precious.

1:29:03.600 --> 1:29:07.300
And the loss of
a single life, even in Oz,

1:29:07.300 --> 1:29:09.200
is my loss too.

1:29:10.867 --> 1:29:13.133
- Well, that's bullshit.

1:29:13.133 --> 1:29:15.867
The only thing
that matters is you and me.

1:29:18.166 --> 1:29:20.200
- I don't expect you
to understand.

1:29:20.200 --> 1:29:23.000
You kill for sport.

1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:25.066
- I don't understand?

1:29:25.066 --> 1:29:28.600
I'm not the one who
got here by accident, pal.

1:29:28.600 --> 1:29:30.900
I kill
because I have to.

1:29:30.900 --> 1:29:34.800
I kill what stands
in my way,

1:29:34.800 --> 1:29:38.266
like the Aryans.

1:29:38.266 --> 1:29:39.700
- What?

1:29:39.700 --> 1:29:41.300
What about the Aryans?

1:29:41.300 --> 1:29:42.800
- They're no threat
to us anymore.

1:29:42.800 --> 1:29:44.934
I took care of that.

1:29:44.934 --> 1:29:46.300
- How?
How'd you take care of it?

1:29:46.300 --> 1:29:47.600
- Never mind, kiss me.

1:29:47.600 --> 1:29:49.233
- Wait.

1:29:53.967 --> 1:29:56.200
Answer me
this first, okay?

1:29:58.467 --> 1:30:00.467
I want you
to be honest, okay?

1:30:05.300 --> 1:30:07.467
Did you purposely
fuck up my parole?

1:30:22.667 --> 1:30:24.900
- Toby, I couldn't face
the rest of my life

1:30:24.900 --> 1:30:26.734
living in here
without you.

1:30:29.800 --> 1:30:32.033
Don't you see?
I did what I did out of love.

1:30:34.567 --> 1:30:37.567
- If you really love me,

1:30:37.567 --> 1:30:40.367
then leave me alone.

1:30:46.033 --> 1:30:47.600
- I can't.

1:30:47.600 --> 1:30:49.867
- Listen to me.
Listen to me.

1:30:49.867 --> 1:30:51.367
I loved alcohol.

1:30:51.367 --> 1:30:53.400
I loved heroin.

1:30:53.400 --> 1:30:56.967
I had to put them behind me
because they were poison.

1:30:58.867 --> 1:31:00.100
Death.

1:31:03.867 --> 1:31:06.000
You are death.

1:31:07.800 --> 1:31:09.500
Let me live.

1:31:23.200 --> 1:31:26.367
- I can't.
- Motherfucker!

1:31:26.367 --> 1:31:29.233
- Toby, I love you.

1:31:29.233 --> 1:31:30.800
Beecher, don't!

1:31:30.800 --> 1:31:32.767
- No!

1:31:32.767 --> 1:31:34.300
No!
- No!

1:31:57.200 --> 1:32:00.300
God is a funny fellow,
Sister.

1:32:02.333 --> 1:32:06.066
See, I decided this morning
to cooperate with the FBI

1:32:06.066 --> 1:32:07.800
to help them
convict Keller.

1:32:07.800 --> 1:32:08.900
- Oh?

1:32:08.900 --> 1:32:13.667
- And now,
with Keller dead,

1:32:13.667 --> 1:32:16.400
that opportunity
is gone,

1:32:16.400 --> 1:32:20.133
and with it,
my chance for freedom.

1:32:20.133 --> 1:32:24.967
In fact, I may be
facing the death penalty

1:32:24.967 --> 1:32:26.633
for Keller's murder.

1:32:26.633 --> 1:32:29.100
- You didn't push him,
did you?

1:32:29.100 --> 1:32:30.767
- No.

1:32:32.834 --> 1:32:36.900
- Well, let's hope this time
the truth works for you.

1:32:36.900 --> 1:32:41.233
- You know, he said he did
what he did out of love.

1:32:41.233 --> 1:32:43.934
- Oh, love is used

1:32:43.934 --> 1:32:48.066
as an excuse
for so many things.

1:32:48.066 --> 1:32:51.333
- No.

1:32:51.333 --> 1:32:54.767
He really did
love me, Sister.

1:32:54.767 --> 1:32:57.934
- Yes.

1:32:57.934 --> 1:32:59.767
- And I loved him.

1:33:02.400 --> 1:33:06.734
When God was
designing the universe,

1:33:06.734 --> 1:33:09.567
why did he make
something so wonderful

1:33:09.567 --> 1:33:12.400
so fucking painful?

1:33:13.533 --> 1:33:16.800
- I think he thought
we could handle it.

1:33:16.800 --> 1:33:18.834
- Beecher.

1:33:18.834 --> 1:33:21.233
I'm going to move you
back to Unit J.

1:33:21.233 --> 1:33:22.834
I'm concerned
about the Aryans

1:33:22.834 --> 1:33:25.000
taking revenge on you
for Schillinger.

1:33:25.000 --> 1:33:27.333
- I said the same thing
to Keller, and he said,

1:33:27.333 --> 1:33:30.300
"Don't worry,
I've handled the Aryans."

1:33:30.300 --> 1:33:32.700
- What did he mean by that?

1:33:45.000 --> 1:33:46.900
- Hey, Andenaur,
check it out.

1:33:46.900 --> 1:33:49.500
You got a package.

1:33:49.500 --> 1:33:53.433
- Hmm, no name,

1:33:53.433 --> 1:33:56.000
no return address.

1:34:01.233 --> 1:34:03.934
What the fuck is this?
- I don't know.

1:34:17.533 --> 1:34:21.100
- They're all  dead?
- Yes, plus two C.O.'s.

1:34:21.100 --> 1:34:23.300
- From what?
- I'm not sure, but it could be

1:34:23.300 --> 1:34:25.266
any number of toxins
or chemicals.

1:34:25.266 --> 1:34:26.834
I cordoned off the area,
but I've got to tell you,

1:34:26.834 --> 1:34:28.567
this is way beyond
my expertise.

1:34:28.567 --> 1:34:29.767
- What do we do?

1:34:29.767 --> 1:34:31.000
- Call the state
bio-terrorism unit,

1:34:31.000 --> 1:34:34.300
and clear out
the entire complex, fast!

1:34:34.300 --> 1:34:36.734
- Proceed immediately
to level one,

1:34:36.734 --> 1:34:38.834
emergency evacuation.

1:34:38.834 --> 1:34:40.467
- Where are we going
to take them?

1:34:40.467 --> 1:34:41.934
- Beats the shit
out of me.

1:34:41.934 --> 1:34:43.400
All I've been told is

1:34:43.400 --> 1:34:45.033
the move is temporary.

1:34:45.033 --> 1:34:46.266
We'll be back,
someday.

1:34:46.266 --> 1:34:48.834
- Emergency evacuation.

1:34:55.500 --> 1:34:57.567
- I said everybody out!

1:35:07.834 --> 1:35:09.834
- Come on, move it!

1:35:09.834 --> 1:35:12.133
- Let's go! Let's go

1:35:17.734 --> 1:35:19.000
- Let's go!

1:35:21.100 --> 1:35:23.800
- Give me a blanket!
- Shut up and move!

1:35:24.867 --> 1:35:26.433
- Let's go,
Come on, let's go!

1:35:26.433 --> 1:35:27.867
- All right, come on.
Come on.

1:35:30.500 --> 1:35:32.800
- Back of the bus first.

1:35:32.800 --> 1:35:35.033
Move to the back
of the bus.

1:36:28.800 --> 1:36:31.033
- Count!

1:36:31.033 --> 1:36:33.633
- A lot of people thought
we'd never reopen Emerald City.

1:36:33.633 --> 1:36:35.667
- Came out like
nothing was happening...

1:36:35.667 --> 1:36:37.200
- I killed a man.

1:36:39.066 --> 1:36:40.633
- Fuck you.
- Help!

1:36:40.633 --> 1:36:42.834
- Lights out, O'Reily.

1:36:42.834 --> 1:36:44.633
- Settle down!

1:36:44.633 --> 1:36:46.533
- Officer!

1:36:51.767 --> 1:36:54.533
- The bikers, the Christians,
the gays...

1:36:54.533 --> 1:36:56.667
- Follow routine.

1:36:56.667 --> 1:37:01.567
- We tell you when to sleep,
when to eat,

1:37:01.567 --> 1:37:03.600
when to piss.

1:37:33.066 --> 1:37:35.600
- So, what have
we learned?

1:37:35.600 --> 1:37:38.033
What's the lesson
for today,

1:37:38.033 --> 1:37:41.867
for all the never-ending days
and restless nights in Oz?

1:37:41.867 --> 1:37:44.533
That morality
is transient?

1:37:44.533 --> 1:37:49.433
That virtue cannot exist
without violence?

1:37:49.433 --> 1:37:53.433
That to be honest
is to be flawed?

1:37:53.433 --> 1:37:55.867
That the giving
and taking of love,

1:37:55.867 --> 1:37:59.066
both debases
and elevates us?

1:37:59.066 --> 1:38:04.300
That God or Allah or Yahweh
has answer to questions

1:38:04.300 --> 1:38:07.567
we dare not even ask?

1:38:07.567 --> 1:38:09.934
The story is simple.

1:38:09.934 --> 1:38:13.233
A man lives
in prison and dies.

1:38:13.233 --> 1:38:17.200
How he dies,
that's easy.

1:38:17.200 --> 1:38:21.967
The who and the why
is the complex part,

1:38:21.967 --> 1:38:25.533
the human part,

1:38:25.533 --> 1:38:29.433
the only part worth...

1:38:29.433 --> 1:38:31.133
knowing.

1:38:34.700 --> 1:38:36.500
Peace.
