WEBVTT

02:43.413 --> 02:44.789
<i>No, no, no, no, no!</i>

03:53.608 --> 03:57.028
Pat, I swear, your voice just seems to get
better and better.

03:57.028 --> 03:59.697
You sure you didn't go to Juilliard
or something?

04:00.657 --> 04:02.909
I did use to have a friend named Julie

04:02.909 --> 04:05.912
when I was a kid,
and we did play in her yard.

04:07.413 --> 04:08.831
Sometimes we would sing.

04:08.831 --> 04:11.292
Oh, my God!
Patrick Montgomery, I swear,

04:11.292 --> 04:13.628
if there was an Olympic competition
for dorky jokes,

04:13.628 --> 04:15.296
I'd be married to a gold medalist.

04:15.296 --> 04:17.632
Your voice has gotten better.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.550
Well, how about me?
I sing like a swallow.

04:19.550 --> 04:22.011
No need to get competitive.

04:23.012 --> 04:25.682
Life is a competition, don't they say?

04:25.682 --> 04:28.101
Don't you like to say that, Pastor Jackie?

04:28.101 --> 04:30.770
Never.
I don't believe I ever even thought it.

04:30.770 --> 04:33.272
We should all be thinking about it

04:33.272 --> 04:35.400
if we're serious about winning
the church volleyball league.

04:36.192 --> 04:40.655
And maybe we should consider opening
our doors to the Congregationalists.

04:40.655 --> 04:43.825
Don Awrey is 6'5"
and spikes like a madman.

04:43.825 --> 04:44.993
He is great.

04:44.993 --> 04:47.120
Well, you know,
I dated a Congregationalist once,

04:47.120 --> 04:49.497
and he insisted on prayin'
before goin' car parking.

04:50.498 --> 04:51.791
No, wait! No, he's Episcopalian!

04:53.918 --> 04:54.919
What about you, Don?

04:55.461 --> 04:56.754
Are you ever gonna join the team?

04:56.754 --> 04:59.549
- Volleyball's not my thing.
- Not enough mayhem.

04:59.549 --> 05:02.010
He gravitates towards viciousness.
That's why he went into law.

05:02.927 --> 05:05.054
Didn't you play professional football?

05:05.054 --> 05:07.181
- For the Washington Redskins.
- Yes!

05:07.181 --> 05:09.559
Nah, I tried out, I didn't make the team.

05:09.559 --> 05:11.769
And it kills him to this day.

05:13.104 --> 05:15.023
I'm gonna go get some potato salad.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.149
I'll race you.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.944
We should really get going soon
because the chart says

05:19.944 --> 05:23.197
that I'm going to reach
peak fertility around 1:00 PM

05:23.197 --> 05:25.074
today, so.

05:25.074 --> 05:26.200
Oh, right.

05:28.536 --> 05:29.829
Little bit slower.

05:30.872 --> 05:32.290
Little bit slower!

05:35.543 --> 05:38.546
And be sure to emit
as you propulse forward.

05:38.546 --> 05:41.257
- Evidently, that's helpful.
- Really?

05:42.383 --> 05:45.136
- Here. Try to go deeper.
- I'm going as deep as I can, Betty.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.596
No, you have been deeper before.

05:48.473 --> 05:51.642
If you can squirt rather than drip,
that helps, too.

05:53.269 --> 05:54.228
But, slower.

05:54.228 --> 05:55.438
Deeper!

05:57.482 --> 05:58.441
And squirt!

06:14.999 --> 06:18.002
- Keep going, honey. You're doing great.
- Do I have to sing it?

06:18.002 --> 06:19.128
Yes.

06:19.962 --> 06:23.508
If you wanna keep filling that
sweet little heart of yours up with joy!

06:31.099 --> 06:34.102
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, hey, hey!

06:34.644 --> 06:36.395
- Come in!
- All right.

06:36.395 --> 06:38.898
<i>And why do I have the pleasure</i>

06:38.898 --> 06:42.902
of a house call from my favorite pastor?

06:43.653 --> 06:44.779
Well.

06:45.655 --> 06:48.366
It's not exactly pleasure, I'm afraid. And...

06:49.617 --> 06:51.285
I might stop being your favorite pastor.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.457
What's goin' on?

06:57.875 --> 06:59.293
Bill's gone.

06:59.961 --> 07:01.963
He wants a divorce.

07:05.675 --> 07:07.635
It's been comin' for a long time.

07:07.635 --> 07:09.637
I know that you've been struggling some.

07:09.637 --> 07:10.888
Sweetie, sing louder.

07:14.934 --> 07:15.768
That's good.

07:16.894 --> 07:21.274
You will get through this.
I will drag you through this.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.151
- I'm scared. I'll admit it.
- What about?

07:24.443 --> 07:27.738
For starters,
how will I lead the congregation?

07:27.738 --> 07:30.950
You're gonna lead us the same
as you always have.

07:31.576 --> 07:35.413
And being single,
after 23 years of marriage.

07:35.413 --> 07:40.168
I'm not sure I even know
how to put one foot in front of the other.

07:40.168 --> 07:45.006
So you just need to look at this
as a new beginning.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.885
A new destiny.

07:51.345 --> 07:54.265
- It's not fair.
- It's my job, Betty.

07:54.265 --> 07:57.643
The whole point of that new job
was that you wouldn't have to travel.

07:57.643 --> 08:00.688
As much. And I don't.

08:00.688 --> 08:03.024
Well, it's not normal for a husband
and wife to be apart.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.066
That's all I'm saying.

08:04.859 --> 08:07.236
Right, but we're talking about
four days here.

08:07.236 --> 08:11.407
Four critical days during peak fertility.

08:11.407 --> 08:17.747
Didn't the doctors say that you might
get pregnant easier if you stress less?

08:20.291 --> 08:22.376
- So it's my fault.
- I didn't say that.

08:22.376 --> 08:24.545
- Of course, you did. You did.
- No, I didn't.

08:25.296 --> 08:28.090
And you might consider that it's
your traveling that's causing my stress.

08:49.237 --> 08:50.279
Okay.

08:52.073 --> 08:55.993
So, the thing is, Jackie, our minister,

08:55.993 --> 08:58.746
she's not just out of town
on church business.

08:58.746 --> 09:01.707
She chose not to be here today.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.709
Because I'm on the church council,

09:03.709 --> 09:07.713
she felt it better
that I break the news first.

09:08.881 --> 09:11.676
Jackie and her husband Bill
are getting a divorce.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.429
It happens.

09:16.222 --> 09:19.767
Get over it.
Pastors are people like everybody else.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.688
I see some of you squirming in your seats,

09:23.688 --> 09:26.774
like you suddenly got
pine cones up your butts.

09:26.774 --> 09:29.694
Well, I tell you, if you ever did get
a pine cone up your keister,

09:29.694 --> 09:32.029
you'd be squealing like a pig.

09:32.029 --> 09:35.992
And Jackie Ponder would be the first one
runnin' to your aid.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.869
So let's run to hers.

09:39.996 --> 09:43.666
Not the time to be high-horse,
moral dopes.

09:45.668 --> 09:49.422
Let's just get on with being
good Methodists.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.215
We can start tonight

09:51.215 --> 09:53.759
by kicking some Lutheran butts
at volleyball.

09:58.180 --> 09:59.515
I got it!

10:05.646 --> 10:07.315
Betty, hey. Hi.

10:09.233 --> 10:10.943
Thought you'd be playing tonight.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.570
Sitting this one out.

10:16.407 --> 10:17.992
Understood.

10:17.992 --> 10:20.244
Yeah. Makes sense.

10:20.244 --> 10:21.120
I got it!

10:22.913 --> 10:25.333
- What makes sense?
- What?

10:25.333 --> 10:27.335
My sitting this game out makes sense.

10:27.335 --> 10:30.296
- Why does it make sense?
- Well, if you are expecting,

10:31.130 --> 10:33.049
it makes sense
that you'd steer clear of any

10:33.632 --> 10:36.177
intense physical activity.

10:36.177 --> 10:37.970
What makes you think I'm expecting?

10:42.433 --> 10:44.101
No, no, I'm sorry.

10:44.101 --> 10:46.062
I just heard you and Allan were trying.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.688
I...

10:48.564 --> 10:51.233
I apologize. I overstepped.

10:53.194 --> 10:55.571
- Betty, I'm really sorry.
- It's fine. It's fine. It's fine.

10:59.617 --> 11:01.452
You really do
have a wonderful singing voice.

11:01.952 --> 11:04.288
Thank you. Thank you.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.168
Got it, got it, got it!

11:11.670 --> 11:12.797
Are you okay?

11:12.797 --> 11:14.423
I'm fine. I'm fine.

11:15.174 --> 11:17.843
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Yeah.

11:18.386 --> 11:20.554
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

11:21.263 --> 11:23.933
- Good. Okay.
- You don't wanna sit for a bit?

11:23.933 --> 11:26.727
No, I'm fine, Allan. I'm fine, thank you.

11:26.727 --> 11:28.437
- Alright.
- Thanks.

11:28.437 --> 11:29.980
Sorry. I gotta communicate.

11:48.207 --> 11:50.709
What do you mean he smelled like sex?

11:51.710 --> 11:53.337
I mean he smelled like sex.

11:55.047 --> 11:58.509
- Are we talkin' about the same Allan Gore?
- Oh yeah. I know.

11:59.677 --> 12:03.639
I know, but how a man looks and smells
can be two totally different things.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.475
And plus.

12:07.351 --> 12:08.352
Plus what?

12:09.270 --> 12:11.063
Well, I was kind of

12:12.398 --> 12:14.442
gettin' the sense that he was
likin' the smell of me, too.

12:14.442 --> 12:15.901
Like it could maybe go in that direction.

12:16.944 --> 12:17.903
What direction?

12:18.904 --> 12:21.157
- I'm not sayin' that I would ever--
- Candy!

12:27.705 --> 12:29.665
It's just this whole thing with Jackie.

12:31.125 --> 12:34.670
Maybe it's just kind of opened up a can.

12:36.380 --> 12:37.798
What can?

12:39.216 --> 12:42.636
The "content is not all
it's cracked up to be" can.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.307
You know, my father, he used to say to me,

12:46.307 --> 12:49.685
"Candy, if you ain't growing,
you're dying."

12:50.603 --> 12:52.229
And he would also say,

12:52.229 --> 12:54.231
"If you ain't searching

12:56.108 --> 12:57.902
you're lost."

13:00.404 --> 13:02.031
Allan Gore?

13:05.409 --> 13:07.369
I mean,
he'd be "fall-in-love-proof," anyway.

13:07.369 --> 13:08.954
Just take a look at him.

13:08.954 --> 13:11.248
Who could be more
"fall-in-love-proof" than that?

14:26.073 --> 14:28.993
Gary, would you like to share your poem?

14:29.785 --> 14:32.288
Okay. It's short.

14:32.288 --> 14:35.666
That's fine.
Some of my favorite poems are short.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.626
Haikus are quite wonderful, in fact.

14:40.087 --> 14:42.006
"On my brand new toilet

14:43.215 --> 14:45.134
I did the same thing."

14:52.516 --> 14:55.185
It's about the folly of materialism.

14:58.105 --> 15:00.024
God, I totally get it.

15:01.233 --> 15:04.653
We all think that we can change our lives
with stuff, you know?

15:04.653 --> 15:07.323
I do it all the time
with shoes or whatever.

15:07.323 --> 15:09.533
If I could just have that or just get this
things will be different.

15:10.284 --> 15:12.786
Mine's actually got a similar theme
about "wanting."

15:12.786 --> 15:13.871
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.623
- Let's hear it, Candy.
- Okay.

15:16.373 --> 15:19.877
- It's called, "My Heart Asked."
- What a lovely title.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.675
"My heart asked, 'What's the answer?'

15:28.427 --> 15:31.680
"I said, 'What answer?'
It said, 'You know.'

15:31.680 --> 15:35.559
"I said, 'I don't know.
I give up. What's the answer?'

15:37.102 --> 15:38.520
"And the heart said,

15:39.688 --> 15:42.441
'The answer is don't give up.'"

16:43.877 --> 16:46.630
- Good night, Sherry.
- See you at home.

16:46.630 --> 16:48.424
- Bye, Candy!
- See ya.

17:33.969 --> 17:35.971
Allan! Hi!

17:37.431 --> 17:39.850
- Hey, Candy.
- Hey.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.227
I want to talk to you sometime about

17:43.437 --> 17:45.063
something that's been
bothering me a little.

17:48.108 --> 17:49.985
How about right now?

17:51.403 --> 17:52.613
Sure.

18:02.748 --> 18:04.917
I've been thinking about you a lot,

18:04.917 --> 18:06.919
and it's really been bothering me,
and I'm not

18:08.128 --> 18:11.131
sure whether I want you to do
anything about it or not.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.770
I'm very attracted to you.

18:24.770 --> 18:27.731
And I'm just tired of thinkin' about it,
so I wanted to tell you that.

19:09.398 --> 19:11.400
<i>You seriously got in his car?</i>

19:11.400 --> 19:13.151
I did.

19:13.151 --> 19:16.446
- And told him you were thinking about him?
- I did.

19:17.239 --> 19:19.199
And what did he say?

19:19.199 --> 19:21.451
He said, "Oh. Okay."

19:21.451 --> 19:23.287
- That's it?
- Pretty much.

19:23.871 --> 19:26.623
Are you sure
this is really about Allan Gore

19:26.623 --> 19:29.334
and not about you wantin' to be reckless?

19:30.252 --> 19:31.670
Maybe a little of both.

19:34.047 --> 19:36.466
But also men,
they get to go to their jobs

19:36.466 --> 19:38.302
and live in their careers and

19:39.344 --> 19:41.638
we just stay home and

19:43.682 --> 19:45.309
God, that's supposed to be enough.

19:48.937 --> 19:50.772
Look at our kids right now
on that jungle gym.

19:51.315 --> 19:55.319
It is human nature to take risks.

19:55.319 --> 19:59.740
To go for somethin' with a little thrill
at the risk of falling.

20:00.449 --> 20:01.992
I mean, look at their faces.

20:03.076 --> 20:04.995
They are more alive than we are.

20:09.708 --> 20:11.126
It's not appropriate.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.297
- Why?
- Because it's not.

20:16.131 --> 20:19.676
Where did you even get all of this stuff?

20:19.676 --> 20:20.719
Jenny's mom.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.221
You're gonna have to pick another costume.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.181
- Why?
- I told you, it's not appropriate,

20:24.181 --> 20:26.558
- especially for a girl your age.
- Dad!

20:26.558 --> 20:28.101
No, no! Never mind.

20:28.101 --> 20:30.354
I will not have you out on the streets
trick or treating as a trollop.

20:30.354 --> 20:31.813
We will find something better.

20:32.189 --> 20:34.775
This is why I did not want her
seeing that movie!

20:35.776 --> 20:38.278
-"Grease"? That's a family picture, honey.
- No, no.

20:38.278 --> 20:41.156
It's a bunch of talk of girls putting out.

20:51.291 --> 20:54.044
- You're judging me.
- I am not judging you.

20:54.044 --> 20:56.880
Allan, you do some of your best commentary
with silence.

21:00.300 --> 21:02.344
One of the reasons

21:03.804 --> 21:06.348
why I go silent is because
when you get like this,

21:06.348 --> 21:07.891
I don't know what to say.

21:09.601 --> 21:10.936
I don't know what you want me to say.

21:18.151 --> 21:20.028
<i>The first time I took my wife out,
I knew she wasn't smart.</i>

21:20.028 --> 21:20.988
<i>Why's that.</i>

21:20.988 --> 21:22.489
<i>I took her to a drive-in movie, you know,</i>

21:22.489 --> 21:24.533
<i>and I asked if she wanted to
go in the back seat, you know.</i>

21:24.533 --> 21:25.909
<i>She said she'd rather use
the ladies' room!</i>

21:29.121 --> 21:31.206
<i>But the day I got married,
that was something.</i>

21:31.206 --> 21:32.958
<i>Everybody was crying.</i>

21:32.958 --> 21:35.210
<i>During the ceremony,
her mother cried, you know?</i>

21:35.210 --> 21:37.337
<i>All the way to the hotel, my wife cried.</i>

21:37.337 --> 21:39.464
<i>And when she got undressed,
I cried, you know?</i>

21:44.094 --> 21:45.846
Did you read my short?

21:46.972 --> 21:48.181
Sorry?

21:49.641 --> 21:52.978
My short story from writing class.
I asked if you would read it.

21:53.729 --> 21:55.564
I did. Excellent.

21:58.108 --> 21:59.484
Yeah? What was it about?

22:00.527 --> 22:02.404
It was about swans.

22:04.239 --> 22:05.490
What about swans?

22:06.450 --> 22:09.661
Wow. If I knew there was gonna be a test,
I would've studied harder.

22:10.495 --> 22:12.205
Then study harder, Pat.

22:12.873 --> 22:14.082
You have a Ph.D.

22:14.833 --> 22:16.752
Yep. Not in swans, though.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.756
Yep.

22:25.218 --> 22:27.763
- Let me read it again.
-<i>My car, I tell you, Johnny.</i>

22:27.763 --> 22:29.890
-<i>Bad car?</i>
-<i>I got the only car</i>

22:29.890 --> 22:31.099
<i>dogs chase it, they catch it.</i>

22:36.605 --> 22:38.982
<i>I told the graduating class...</i>

23:54.266 --> 23:57.686
It's not about repainting or redoing.
We need a new sanctuary.

23:57.686 --> 24:01.356
Well, a church is more about its
parishioners than its hardscape, Jo Ann.

24:01.356 --> 24:03.316
That may be well and true, but this church

24:03.316 --> 24:05.360
isn't gonna be anything if we don't grow
the congregation.

24:05.360 --> 24:06.778
And for that, we need a new facility.

24:06.778 --> 24:09.281
It's not just that it's old, Jackie.
It's crappy.

24:10.115 --> 24:13.410
Nobody looking for a new house of worship
wants crappy.

24:13.410 --> 24:14.494
It should make a statement.

24:15.162 --> 24:17.164
Especially if we wanna
draw the younger couples.

24:17.789 --> 24:19.958
Well, aren't we supposed
to be the younger couples?

24:19.958 --> 24:21.459
Where's your head, Allan?

24:24.045 --> 24:25.255
I'm sorry? What?

24:25.839 --> 24:28.675
Where's your head?
You think we need a new sanctuary?

24:32.512 --> 24:34.639
- Well--
- You know, the thing about

24:35.390 --> 24:37.642
religion and life and love

24:38.476 --> 24:40.270
is that there's renewal in it.

24:40.979 --> 24:44.441
And, to me,
nothing sells renewal better than

24:45.692 --> 24:47.152
you know, something new.

24:49.070 --> 24:52.157
I agree. We need a major building.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.284
So if we look at our finances

24:55.452 --> 24:58.163
year-to-date, and we see

24:58.830 --> 25:00.916
that we are already...

25:21.937 --> 25:25.982
Well, you would think the teams themselves
would have to clean up, not the referees,

25:25.982 --> 25:28.818
but I suppose that would just
make too much sense, wouldn't it?

25:28.818 --> 25:30.987
Well, are we still on for coffee tomorrow?

25:30.987 --> 25:32.656
Is the sun still planning to rise?

25:33.657 --> 25:34.991
Well, I'll call you!

25:38.745 --> 25:41.456
So is Betty not feeling too good again?

25:41.456 --> 25:46.670
Some headaches and so forth.
Probably stress-related.

25:46.670 --> 25:51.299
You haven't got any tricks up your sleeve
to relax your bride, Allan?

25:52.550 --> 25:54.678
Betty's seen all my tricks.

25:57.180 --> 25:59.307
Well, this is me.

26:00.976 --> 26:02.602
You tell her that I hope
she's feeling better and

26:02.602 --> 26:06.231
she can always drop Alisa off
if she wants to rest.

26:06.231 --> 26:08.233
- I'll tell her that. Thank you.
- Yeah.

26:09.442 --> 26:11.111
You sure I can trust you two alone?

26:17.450 --> 26:18.952
Well, good night.

26:22.038 --> 26:22.872
Candy.

26:28.336 --> 26:31.798
Before, in the car.

26:33.383 --> 26:36.636
What exactly was it that you had in mind?

26:42.517 --> 26:43.476
Get in.

26:56.072 --> 26:58.658
Would you be interested
in having an affair?

27:05.165 --> 27:06.666
It's just something
I've been thinkin' about

27:06.666 --> 27:10.003
and so I wanted to say it,
so I don't have to think about it anymore.

27:16.009 --> 27:17.594
Okay. Well, I got my answer.

27:17.594 --> 27:19.262
No, no, it's just.

27:22.098 --> 27:23.308
I don't think I could.

27:24.434 --> 27:25.810
You know, I love Betty.

27:29.606 --> 27:32.484
And when we were living in New Mexico,
she had an affair.

27:32.484 --> 27:33.985
Betty did?

27:34.736 --> 27:36.363
Well, I can't believe that.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.323
I know. I couldn't believe it either.

27:38.323 --> 27:40.617
It hurt me a lot
and I wouldn't want to do that to her.

27:40.617 --> 27:42.744
That's fine, Allan.

27:42.744 --> 27:44.913
I love Pat, too,
and I wouldn't wanna do anything

27:44.913 --> 27:46.998
to hurt him either.

27:46.998 --> 27:49.000
- I like Pat.
- Yeah.

27:52.295 --> 27:53.922
He has the best voice in the choir.

27:57.634 --> 28:00.553
- Also, Betty just got pregnant again.
- Really?

28:01.805 --> 28:04.099
Just recently.

28:05.141 --> 28:07.894
So that would really be unfair to her.

28:09.479 --> 28:12.273
Especially since I don't
feel the same way about you

28:12.273 --> 28:13.983
that I do about her.

28:15.819 --> 28:17.570
So, I probably couldn't do
something like that.

28:18.571 --> 28:20.156
Okay.

28:20.156 --> 28:22.909
I was just putting the option out there
because of how I felt.

28:22.909 --> 28:25.954
But I certainly don't want
to hurt you or your marriage.

28:27.580 --> 28:29.499
All I wanted to do was

28:31.126 --> 28:32.460
go to bed.

28:32.460 --> 28:36.047
But I won't mention it again.

28:44.013 --> 28:44.889
Good night.

28:59.904 --> 29:01.865
<i>I feel so humiliated.</i>

29:01.865 --> 29:04.117
It's probably for the best, sweetheart.

29:04.117 --> 29:08.538
Well, I wasn't looking for what's best.
I was out for something more transcendent.

29:08.538 --> 29:12.083
And he broached it!
He invited the conversation.

29:13.001 --> 29:14.627
What exactly did he say?

29:14.627 --> 29:20.800
He asked me what I had in mind
when he knew very well what I had in mind.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.803
And then he climbed into my car.
I mean, come on.

29:25.096 --> 29:27.807
And why did he kiss me?

29:28.975 --> 29:29.934
Right on the lips.

29:30.351 --> 29:33.104
It wasn't exactly passionate.

29:34.022 --> 29:36.232
But it wasn't a brotherly kiss either.

29:36.733 --> 29:40.195
Well, men kiss all the time
when they don't mean it.

29:40.195 --> 29:42.614
No, I think he's waitin' for me
to make it happen.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.949
He doesn't wanna hate himself
for being unfaithful to Betty.

29:45.533 --> 29:47.952
So he's waitin' for me to make it happen.

29:49.662 --> 29:51.581
Well, he can forget about that.

29:52.582 --> 29:55.084
I played my cards, and that will be that.

29:55.084 --> 29:56.169
Mornin'.

30:09.641 --> 30:11.351
<i>Well, my word in Heaven, are you a bird?</i>

30:11.351 --> 30:13.186
No, wait. You're a plane, aren't you?

30:13.186 --> 30:14.854
I'm Superman!

30:14.854 --> 30:17.065
You're Superman! You're a man of steel!

30:17.065 --> 30:18.900
And you might be the super-est one
I have ever seen.

30:19.692 --> 30:22.278
- Well, thank you.
- Well, you're welcome. Hey, honey!

30:22.278 --> 30:24.239
- Hey, Mom.
- You're back already, huh?

30:24.239 --> 30:27.283
- Just to drop off. I filled my pumpkin.
- Yes, you did.

30:27.283 --> 30:29.953
I'm just gonna go dump it
and come back out.

30:30.495 --> 30:32.997
Well, what do you expect to do
with all that candy, young lady?

30:32.997 --> 30:34.999
- I'll trade with Ian.
- Okay.

30:36.918 --> 30:39.504
- Thanks for walking with them.
- Sure, sure.

30:39.504 --> 30:41.047
Did you see Pat and Ian on your travels?

30:41.047 --> 30:43.967
I did see a pretty scary Elvis.

30:43.967 --> 30:46.302
Yep, that would be Pat.

30:47.136 --> 30:49.013
Him and Elvis,
it's kinda hard to tell them apart.

30:50.765 --> 30:52.225
Come on, Dad. Let's go.

30:52.225 --> 30:53.935
- Okay. Bye.
- Trick or treat!

30:53.935 --> 30:57.021
Oh, my goodness, look at you!
Buzz, buzz, buzz!

30:58.273 --> 31:00.191
If I could only have a brain!

31:00.191 --> 31:03.194
Look how cute you guys look.
And look at you.

31:03.194 --> 31:06.489
Don't sting me!
The Wicked Witch of the West!

31:17.083 --> 31:18.793
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

31:18.793 --> 31:21.421
- Oh, my God.
- I brought you a confection.

31:21.421 --> 31:22.422
Yes.

31:22.422 --> 31:24.591
And at the bakery,
they said if we ate it before 10:00 AM,

31:24.591 --> 31:26.009
it won't make our asses fat.

31:26.009 --> 31:28.386
At least, not completely.

31:29.429 --> 31:31.889
- Then, shall we? Hurry up!
- Yes, we shall!

31:35.643 --> 31:37.228
This is why your people follow you.

31:37.228 --> 31:38.771
Yeah. I let them eat cake.

31:39.689 --> 31:41.774
So, listen.

31:41.774 --> 31:43.568
I don't like the sound of that.

31:43.568 --> 31:46.404
Remember I told you
about that other job offer

31:46.404 --> 31:48.573
I had at Midwestern University?

31:48.573 --> 31:51.075
- Which you turned down.
- Yeah, well.

31:51.075 --> 31:54.454
- It turns out I reconsidered.
- What do you mean?

31:54.454 --> 31:58.708
It was pointed out that the bishop
doesn't make offers like this every day.

32:00.251 --> 32:04.172
- But it's in Wichita Falls.
- I'll come back and forth.

32:04.172 --> 32:05.965
What do you mean
you'll come back and forth?

32:05.965 --> 32:08.551
It's, like, 200 miles away.

32:08.551 --> 32:10.637
Candy, this is my next calling.

32:12.221 --> 32:13.598
What am I gonna do?

32:13.598 --> 32:15.058
- You're my best friend.
- Our friendship won't change.

32:15.058 --> 32:17.393
No, but you won't be here.

32:17.393 --> 32:20.188
- And who's gonna replace you?
- We'll find somebody great.

32:20.188 --> 32:22.982
Somebody who can get
the new sanctuary built.

32:22.982 --> 32:25.068
Oh, my God.

32:25.860 --> 32:29.238
You are the only one
I have to talk to here, Jackie.

32:29.238 --> 32:31.532
That is not true. You have Sherry.

32:31.532 --> 32:34.494
And you're the belle of the ball
at church.

32:34.494 --> 32:37.246
I mean Sherry is Sherry but

32:38.706 --> 32:40.500
honey, you're my heart.

32:52.136 --> 32:53.888
Hello?

32:53.888 --> 32:56.808
<i>Candy. Hi, it's Allan. Allan Gore.</i>

32:57.892 --> 33:00.937
- Hey.
-<i>Hey. Hi.</i>

33:04.649 --> 33:08.945
I have to go to McKinney tomorrow
to get my tires checked and rotated,

33:08.945 --> 33:11.155
<i>and I know it's a drive,</i>

33:11.155 --> 33:14.951
but I was wondering if you might
like to have some lunch with me.

33:16.911 --> 33:23.209
You know, to talk a little more
about what we were talking about before.

33:23.793 --> 33:24.752
Okay.

33:26.129 --> 33:27.547
Okay, fine.

33:28.423 --> 33:30.007
Well, how's 12:00?

33:31.050 --> 33:32.969
- I'll meet you there.
-<i>Okay.</i>

33:32.969 --> 33:35.680
- Meet you there. Bye-bye.
-<i>Okay.</i>

33:44.355 --> 33:46.190
- Where were we?
- Who was that?

33:47.108 --> 33:50.236
- It's just somebody.
- Somebody?

33:52.780 --> 33:55.158
Somebody I'm thinkin'
about having an affair with.

33:58.077 --> 34:00.329
You told me that 'cause you want me
to talk you out of it.

34:02.457 --> 34:04.208
Pat and I, we...

34:06.544 --> 34:08.296
Well, we kind of hit a plateau.

34:08.296 --> 34:10.173
Every marriage hits one of them.

34:10.173 --> 34:12.383
Well, I suppose yours did
and you did nothing about it.

34:12.383 --> 34:16.179
Meaning what? If I'd had an affair,
Bill would still be taking out my garbage?

34:16.179 --> 34:22.935
I'm talking about my garbage right now,
and not wanting to settle for it.

34:24.979 --> 34:27.273
Sorry, that came out wrong.
Pat is not garbage.

34:27.273 --> 34:30.651
Candy, I got front-door friends
and back-door friends.

34:30.651 --> 34:32.987
Front-door friends show up
when they have a reason.

34:32.987 --> 34:35.740
They knock. They say the right thing.

34:36.449 --> 34:39.118
Back-door friends, they just bang in
through the kitchen door

34:39.118 --> 34:41.120
and drop whatever's on their mind.

34:42.413 --> 34:43.790
You are my best back-door friend

34:43.790 --> 34:47.001
so I am gonna drop my mind
on your table here.

34:47.001 --> 34:50.087
This will come to no good.

34:51.798 --> 34:54.842
Jackie, I have done all the things
a wife is supposed to do.

34:56.302 --> 34:59.388
The house, the kids, the meals.

35:02.433 --> 35:04.894
Where is the payback?

35:05.770 --> 35:06.729
Honey.

35:07.897 --> 35:10.358
This is the payback.

35:11.317 --> 35:14.237
Take it from me. Somebody who lost it.

35:19.242 --> 35:21.118
I can see your mind's made up.

35:38.010 --> 35:39.846
- Thanks again, Ronnie.
- You're welcome.

35:39.846 --> 35:42.765
- Don't work too hard.
- All right.

35:44.725 --> 35:47.228
Hi! You're here.

35:47.228 --> 35:48.855
- Hi.
- Hey.

35:49.689 --> 35:51.440
Brought you this little card.

36:00.366 --> 36:02.118
That is so sweet.

36:04.829 --> 36:06.163
There you are.

36:07.290 --> 36:08.457
Thank you.

36:09.625 --> 36:11.627
I just worry, you know?

36:11.627 --> 36:14.839
Jackie is the church,
when you think about it.

36:14.839 --> 36:17.425
I just hope she doesn't become a stranger.

36:17.425 --> 36:20.469
Well, how can she not?
At least a little.

36:20.970 --> 36:23.389
Wichita Falls is a three-hour drive
last I checked.

36:24.098 --> 36:26.601
And, frankly, I don't know how
we're gonna go about replacing her.

36:28.352 --> 36:30.771
And I don't wanna belong
to some stodgy-podgy church.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.233
- No, that would be awful.
- Awful.

36:39.864 --> 36:42.241
Well, should we talk about our kids now?

36:42.867 --> 36:44.744
Or maybe more Pat.

36:44.744 --> 36:48.247
He was a champion trumpeter
in high school. Did I cover that?

36:55.755 --> 36:58.215
I'm sorry. I've never done anything
like this before.

36:58.215 --> 37:00.217
I haven't either.

37:06.015 --> 37:09.936
I would never be able to forgive myself
if Betty ever found out.

37:11.729 --> 37:14.982
That would just be devastating to her.

37:14.982 --> 37:16.817
I feel the same.

37:16.817 --> 37:21.614
We would have to be so careful
that no one would ever know except us.

37:22.949 --> 37:24.241
That's right.

37:25.576 --> 37:27.703
I've been thinking a lot
about what you said about

37:28.996 --> 37:30.498
just wanting to go to bed,

37:30.498 --> 37:36.087
not getting too emotionally involved
and so forth.

37:36.087 --> 37:38.214
That would be very important to me.

37:38.798 --> 37:40.216
Me, too, Allan.

37:42.176 --> 37:44.595
God, I just wanna enjoy myself.

37:46.973 --> 37:51.644
Without hurting myself or anyone else.

37:57.441 --> 37:58.943
Well,

37:58.943 --> 38:01.946
I think we should
think about it some more.

38:03.114 --> 38:05.908
Think about the hazards and decide

38:05.908 --> 38:08.661
whether or not we're willing
to take the risk.

38:11.622 --> 38:14.208
Fine. Yeah, I think we should.

38:18.963 --> 38:21.590
So, that's the plan then?
Think about it some more?

38:22.383 --> 38:23.342
I think so.

39:47.343 --> 39:50.846
<i>I'm not sure how many more of these
strategy session I can take.</i>

39:50.846 --> 39:52.723
Yeah, I know.

39:52.723 --> 39:55.601
- We just can't be too careful.
-<i>You know,</i>

39:55.601 --> 39:58.604
if you don't go to bed
with me pretty soon,

39:59.980 --> 40:02.358
you'll never be able to live up

40:02.358 --> 40:05.945
<i>to the expectations I have of you in bed.</i>

40:05.945 --> 40:09.740
Yeah, don't think
I haven't thought about that.

40:13.661 --> 40:16.372
Maybe just one more planning session.

40:17.832 --> 40:20.292
- We can have it here.
-<i>At your house?</i>

40:20.292 --> 40:23.504
Yeah, we can meet for lunch.
People need to eat, right?

40:33.973 --> 40:35.349
How was work today?

40:37.810 --> 40:39.562
It's pretty good. Kind of the same.

40:46.443 --> 40:48.904
Have you been going over your list, Allan?

40:51.824 --> 40:53.492
- I'm sorry, what?
- The list.

40:54.869 --> 40:56.829
The list of potential baby names.

40:59.623 --> 41:01.041
- I will.
- You will?

41:01.041 --> 41:02.543
Yeah.

41:04.044 --> 41:04.962
Okay.

41:10.301 --> 41:14.096
If either of us wants it to end
for whatever reason, then it ends.

41:14.096 --> 41:15.181
Agreed.

41:16.182 --> 41:21.061
If either of us get
too emotionally involved, then it ends.

41:21.812 --> 41:23.522
We should make that rule number one.

41:24.273 --> 41:25.983
Sure. Okay.

41:28.777 --> 41:32.114
Okay. And if we start taking risks

41:32.114 --> 41:34.283
that shouldn't be taken,
then the affair ends.

41:34.283 --> 41:37.536
- And we should always meet out of town.
- Agree, agree, agree.

41:42.708 --> 41:49.006
All expenses,
gas, motel, food, will be shared equally.

41:49.006 --> 41:52.801
We'll meet only on weekdays,
and I'll be in charge

41:52.801 --> 41:55.304
of fixing lunch on the days that we meet,

41:55.304 --> 41:56.764
so that we just have more time.

41:57.473 --> 42:00.100
And I'll also be in charge
of getting the motel room.

42:00.643 --> 42:03.062
Same reason.
It just gives us more quality time.

42:03.062 --> 42:04.021
Shall we

42:05.648 --> 42:08.817
set a date for the affair to begin?

42:13.280 --> 42:14.823
Let's go with December 12th.

42:15.491 --> 42:16.450
December 12th?

42:17.785 --> 42:18.953
This year.

42:20.412 --> 42:21.747
Great.

42:22.957 --> 42:25.125
December 12th it is.

42:28.045 --> 42:30.297
<i>Oh, Margaret,
you don't know what it does to me,</i>

42:30.297 --> 42:32.925
<i>being near you all day in surgery,
only able to touch...</i>

42:43.143 --> 42:45.062
<i>You alright?</i>

42:45.062 --> 42:46.272
<i>I'm good.</i>

42:47.564 --> 42:51.068
<i>This song gives me goosebumps.</i>

42:51.068 --> 42:54.196
<i>I'm the same way about
"Pennsylvania 6-5000."</i>

42:58.701 --> 43:00.119
What are you doin'?

43:02.663 --> 43:03.914
What am I doin'?

43:04.748 --> 43:08.585
You once told me that your
favorite character was Snugglepuss.

43:09.545 --> 43:11.880
Did you not tell me that, Pat?

43:11.880 --> 43:13.882
Snagglepuss.

43:56.508 --> 43:58.260
Hey, angel girl.

43:59.595 --> 44:01.513
Come out smarter than you go in.

44:01.513 --> 44:03.265
I will, Mom.

44:03.265 --> 44:04.641
- And no talking to boys.
- You're so silly.

44:17.821 --> 44:20.699
Okay, buddy. Next stop, preschool.

46:27.075 --> 46:28.285
Hello?

46:28.285 --> 46:29.786
<i>I'm at the Continental Inn</i>

46:29.786 --> 46:32.831
<i>on the Central Expressway towards Dallas,
room 214.</i>

46:33.916 --> 46:36.835
I will be there in a few minutes.

47:54.788 --> 47:56.206
What am I doin'?

48:04.256 --> 48:06.925
<i>...and show our boys some
red and blue pride.</i>

48:09.428 --> 48:10.971
<i>...time for a couple of calls.</i>

48:10.971 --> 48:13.140
<i>Hello, Darcy.
Welcome to The Dan Ram Show.</i>

48:13.140 --> 48:16.018
<i>Hey, Dan, thanks for taking my call.</i>

49:00.812 --> 49:01.980
I made lunch.

49:04.524 --> 49:05.901
Well, you look beautiful.
Really beautiful.

49:07.235 --> 49:08.654
Thank you.

49:12.658 --> 49:14.826
- Well, we should eat.
- Excellent.

49:17.204 --> 49:19.998
Wow. Looks delicious.

49:20.916 --> 49:22.084
Sorry.

49:28.006 --> 49:31.760
You know, I've probably driven past
this motel a thousand times

49:31.760 --> 49:33.345
and hardly knew it was here.

49:33.345 --> 49:34.888
Yeah, it's funny that way.

49:35.806 --> 49:37.516
Life. You know, the

49:38.433 --> 49:40.394
bland and innocuous can

49:42.145 --> 49:44.856
suddenly take on vivid hues and colors.

49:50.070 --> 49:51.571
I take a creative writing class.

49:52.406 --> 49:55.117
- Well, that was really good.
- Thank you.

49:56.451 --> 49:59.913
I would love to read
some of your writing sometime.

50:00.622 --> 50:01.581
Really?

50:01.581 --> 50:03.917
Well, that would make one of you

50:03.917 --> 50:05.669
'cause Pat has no interest,

50:05.669 --> 50:08.171
and I read all of his stuff
on electromagnetics--

50:08.171 --> 50:09.840
Are we talking about Pat now?

50:11.049 --> 50:14.344
No, sorry. We're definitely not.

50:44.791 --> 50:46.042
Are you just gonna stand there?

50:47.461 --> 50:48.628
Yes.

51:28.335 --> 51:29.628
Sorry.

51:29.628 --> 51:32.380
Allan,
have you never been French kissed before?

51:36.134 --> 51:39.096
You've never had a woman's tongue
in your mouth?

51:44.726 --> 51:46.853
Well, I think you're gonna quite like it.

53:17.193 --> 53:19.613
- Are you okay?
- I am.

53:21.239 --> 53:22.908
So okay.

53:26.161 --> 53:28.330
- You?
- Oh, yeah.

53:30.332 --> 53:31.249
Yeah.

53:31.791 --> 53:33.668
That was wonderful, Candy.

53:36.588 --> 53:38.465
You're wonderful.

53:43.053 --> 53:44.930
We need to shower.

53:44.930 --> 53:46.765
I probably should have added that
to the list.

53:46.765 --> 53:49.351
Always shower after

53:49.351 --> 53:52.771
and that way,
we won't smell like each other.

53:52.771 --> 53:55.357
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Oh, and Allan.

53:56.608 --> 53:57.692
Allan.

53:58.610 --> 54:00.487
That was

54:02.113 --> 54:03.531
wonderful.

54:10.956 --> 54:11.873
Okay.
