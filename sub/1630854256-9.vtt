WEBVTT

00:15.449 --> 00:17.285
Thank you, Demitri.

00:21.389 --> 00:22.790
Is it...

00:24.058 --> 00:25.893
Real?

00:27.461 --> 00:30.398
They believe only 42
of the tsar's 50 eggs

00:30.498 --> 00:31.832
survive today.

00:31.932 --> 00:34.935
This is 43.

00:35.035 --> 00:37.371
As far as any authorities
are concerned,

00:37.471 --> 00:40.474
this no longer exists.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.243
Yet there it is.

00:43.944 --> 00:46.247
Its beauty and value

00:46.347 --> 00:48.649
increasing every year.

00:50.218 --> 00:51.519
Just like me.

00:54.288 --> 00:56.224
And exactly how beautiful is it?

00:56.324 --> 00:57.758
Seven million.

00:57.858 --> 01:00.261
And since you are
my 100th customer,

01:00.361 --> 01:02.963
I'll give you
the history lesson for free.

01:07.201 --> 01:10.671
Antonio, we need champagne.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.408
Antonio.

01:15.276 --> 01:17.678
Demitri, find Antonio.

01:19.780 --> 01:22.483
It's so difficult
to find good help these days.

01:23.584 --> 01:27.087
Don't you think?

01:29.223 --> 01:31.425
Ah. Well...

01:31.525 --> 01:34.328
this bubbly isn't going
to pop itself, hmm?

01:39.933 --> 01:41.101
Quickly.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.404
Someone will have heard that.

02:20.341 --> 02:22.410
Thank you, Romanovs.

02:43.063 --> 02:44.398
All I'm saying
is that maybe a show

02:44.498 --> 02:45.866
where a woman picks her husband

02:45.966 --> 02:48.936
out of a lineup of men after--
what, like, five dates--

02:49.036 --> 02:51.939
is not a great example for
an impressionable young woman.

02:52.039 --> 02:53.741
Give me a break.
She knows it's scripted.

02:53.841 --> 02:57.144
Rosa knows that it's not real.
Huh?

02:57.245 --> 02:59.947
And I assumed you did, too.

03:00.047 --> 03:02.783
Not real?
What?

03:02.883 --> 03:04.652
I mean, come on,
one of the guy's jobs

03:04.752 --> 03:07.388
is "meatball specialist."
That is not a job

03:07.488 --> 03:08.789
in the real world.

03:08.889 --> 03:11.124
Well, I wasn't certain
of the career logistics.

03:11.225 --> 03:12.660
I just thought you were
making meatballs,

03:12.760 --> 03:13.961
like, all day... Hey.

03:14.061 --> 03:16.029
What? Hey.
Hey.
Hey, guys.

03:16.129 --> 03:17.831
Going on? Hey, hey, hey.
How's it going?
Pound.

03:17.931 --> 03:20.401
Oh. Double pound.
Hey, hey. Yeah.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.270
What is going on?
You haven't happened to

03:22.370 --> 03:25.473
go into the burn room today
at any point?

03:25.573 --> 03:27.641
At 9:00 a.m. on
a Monday morning?

03:27.741 --> 03:29.643
Ha! Yeah, that...
that'd be crazy.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.745
No reason. Everything's fine.
Good to see you guys.

03:31.845 --> 03:34.081
No.
You do realize

03:34.181 --> 03:35.349
I'm a detective, right?

03:35.449 --> 03:36.817
Actually we're both
detectives, babe.

03:36.917 --> 03:38.419
See? Nothing gets by us.
Mm-hmm.

03:38.519 --> 03:40.488
Okay, fine. All right.

03:40.588 --> 03:42.456
Me and Fatima, we keep this list

03:42.556 --> 03:43.824
of absence excuses
in this little notebook

03:43.924 --> 03:45.393
and we hide it in the burn room.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.461
It's the only way we can keep
our stories straight!

03:47.561 --> 03:48.896
Okay, calm down.

03:48.996 --> 03:51.665
But also, have you never
heard of text messages?

03:51.765 --> 03:53.200
A digital trail?!

03:53.301 --> 03:54.668
With Kilbride looking

03:54.768 --> 03:55.703
over our shoulders?

03:55.803 --> 03:57.070
Ain't no way.

03:57.170 --> 03:59.206
Look, Fatima hasn't
shown up to work yet

03:59.307 --> 04:00.441
and I can't find the list.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.910
If Kilbride asks, I'm...
He is gonna

04:03.010 --> 04:04.912
see straight through
your lies, Pinocchio.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.747
Agent Rountree. Oh.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.682
I know that your
generation is,

04:08.782 --> 04:11.952
uh, anti-hustle culture.

04:12.052 --> 04:14.555
But it is 0900

04:14.655 --> 04:16.824
on Monday morning, and I can't

04:16.924 --> 04:20.461
seem to find Agent Namazi anywhere.

04:20.561 --> 04:22.162
She had a car appointment.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.933
An appointment she specifically
made during business hours.

04:26.867 --> 04:29.403
Have her come to my office
when she gets here.

04:29.503 --> 04:30.738
It was a medical emergency.

04:40.714 --> 04:41.749
Was she hurt?

04:41.849 --> 04:44.852
No. Uh... her dog is.

04:44.952 --> 04:45.719
Her dog?

04:45.819 --> 04:47.287
I thought you said

04:47.388 --> 04:49.423
her appointment was for her car.

04:49.523 --> 04:51.359
Yes, I did.

04:51.459 --> 04:53.060
Um, uh...

04:53.160 --> 04:57.531
her dog was...
was hit by a car.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.199
Oh.

04:59.299 --> 05:02.903
And our thoughts
and prayers are with...

05:03.704 --> 05:04.972
...him.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.274
Thoughts and prayers.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.043
<i>"Coholay."</i>

05:11.445 --> 05:13.013
"Coholay"?

05:14.281 --> 05:15.716
"Coholay."

05:18.151 --> 05:19.286
"Coholay"?

05:19.387 --> 05:22.456
Vanilla oat milk latte
for "Coholay"?

05:22.556 --> 05:24.324
So, what do you think?

05:25.325 --> 05:26.594
Sorry?

05:26.694 --> 05:28.195
What do you think
your cup is gonna say?

05:28.295 --> 05:30.097
I've gotten Raft,

05:30.197 --> 05:31.799
Rizzo, Raven.

05:31.899 --> 05:34.568
Two days ago, I got Rafiki.

05:34.668 --> 05:35.769
From <i>The Lion King?</i>

05:35.869 --> 05:37.771
From <i>The Lion King.</i> Huh.

05:37.871 --> 05:40.340
Well, he did write Timon
on my cup yesterday, so...

05:40.441 --> 05:43.343
Huh. Maybe he's going through
a Disney phase.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.314
Hey, I like your necklace.

05:47.415 --> 05:48.849
Oh, thanks.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.217
A girl from the Muslim
Community Center sells them

05:50.317 --> 05:51.852
to help raise funds
for our volunteer group.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.421
We help displaced families
from Kabul settle

05:53.521 --> 05:54.888
in Los Angeles.

05:54.988 --> 05:56.724
I can give you the Etsy link
if you're interested.

05:56.824 --> 05:59.427
Yeah, for sure.
That's really cool.

05:59.527 --> 06:01.228
Yeah, cool.

06:01.328 --> 06:02.896
"Coholay."

06:05.666 --> 06:06.734
Chloe?

06:08.201 --> 06:10.671
Hooked on Phonics
couldn't save us all.

06:13.206 --> 06:14.608
Oh, that's mine.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.677
Moment of truth. Mm.

06:23.150 --> 06:24.284
Susan?

06:24.384 --> 06:27.588
Oh, look at that!
Thank you, Danny.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.890
Susan? Is that right?
Absolutely not.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.391
Do I look like a Susan to you?

06:33.293 --> 06:34.361
I'm Fatima.

06:34.462 --> 06:35.429
Riffat.

06:35.529 --> 06:36.630
But my friends call me Susan.

06:36.730 --> 06:39.399
Simba.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.770
Better have a good reason
for summoning me.

06:44.104 --> 06:46.540
Are we briefing
a ghost ship in here?

06:46.640 --> 06:48.008
Where is everyone?

06:48.108 --> 06:50.410
I thought you'd want to be first
to hear this, sir.

06:52.145 --> 06:54.582
Two Russian nationals
were found dead this morning

06:54.682 --> 06:56.149
on a yacht in Marina Del Rey.

06:56.249 --> 06:59.920
Demitri Fedrov
and Simeon Babanin.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.121
Now, both of this guys
were in the military

07:01.221 --> 07:02.956
before they eventually
started working

07:03.056 --> 07:04.725
for paramilitary Wagner Group.

07:04.825 --> 07:06.293
And most recently,

07:06.393 --> 07:08.596
Demitri's been wanted
for the smuggling and selling

07:08.696 --> 07:10.731
of cultural artifacts
out of Syria.

07:13.066 --> 07:15.969
I'm not seeing the point,
Agent Rountree.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.338
When I ran
the USCG doc on the boat,

07:18.438 --> 07:21.942
it was registered
to none other than...

07:23.477 --> 07:24.878
Arkady Kolcheck.

07:24.978 --> 07:27.515
Why am I not surprised.

07:27.615 --> 07:29.182
Did you contact Agent Callen?

07:29.282 --> 07:31.418
Arkady was attacked.
On his boat?

07:31.519 --> 07:33.453
What? No, at his house.

07:33.554 --> 07:34.488
What house?

07:34.588 --> 07:35.623
Arkady's.
What boat?

07:35.723 --> 07:36.790
Arkady's.

07:36.890 --> 07:38.526
What the hell
is going on here?

07:38.626 --> 07:39.627
You first.

07:39.727 --> 07:40.761
Arkady was attacked

07:40.861 --> 07:42.663
at his house this morning.

07:42.763 --> 07:44.164
He called and left
a message for Callen

07:44.264 --> 07:45.999
saying he'd made it to
some sort of safe house.

07:46.099 --> 07:48.168
Do we know if this is related
to the shooting?

07:48.268 --> 07:49.469
What shooting?
What shooting?

07:50.571 --> 07:51.739
I'll take this one.

07:51.839 --> 07:52.940
The shooting on a boat
this morning

07:53.040 --> 07:54.241
that was registered to Arkady.

07:54.341 --> 07:56.043
No, we don't know
anything about that.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.878
But Callen did ask us
to ping this number

07:57.978 --> 07:59.079
from Arkady's burner phone.

07:59.179 --> 08:00.548
I'm sending it to you now.

08:00.648 --> 08:02.282
But isn't he at a deposition?
All right,

08:02.382 --> 08:04.918
let's get some semblance
of organization here.

08:05.018 --> 08:07.821
Agent Rountree, you run
the search on the burner.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.657
If he is involved in this,

08:09.757 --> 08:11.625
we need to know
about it immediately.
Wait a minute.

08:11.725 --> 08:14.795
I thought Arkady was officially
out of the espionage business.

08:14.895 --> 08:16.864
Even if he is, it doesn't mean
that one of his past mistakes

08:16.964 --> 08:18.265
isn't gonna come back
and bite him in the butt.

08:18.365 --> 08:22.836
I think we at least
need to entertain the thought

08:22.936 --> 08:25.973
that perhaps someone
hasn't been as honest

08:26.073 --> 08:29.009
about his retirement
as previously thought.

08:29.109 --> 08:30.944
Should I call Callen?

08:32.379 --> 08:33.781
No.

08:33.881 --> 08:36.116
Want something done right,
you got to do it yourself.

08:36.216 --> 08:39.319
That's what I always...
I never say that.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.867
This is Arkady's
last know location?

08:53.967 --> 08:55.168
Yes, sir, it's the last place

08:55.268 --> 08:57.605
the burner pinged
before losing signal.

09:10.818 --> 09:12.185
Grisha?

09:14.588 --> 09:15.956
Guess again.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.072
What sort of a moron

09:32.172 --> 09:35.475
decides to make
a safe house from...

09:35.575 --> 09:37.878
whatever this place is?

09:38.879 --> 09:39.947
Am I alive?

09:41.148 --> 09:44.017
Judging by the looks
of this table, barely.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.920
Listen, a Russian would not
look for another Russian

09:47.020 --> 09:49.723
in a bar that serves
rum-based drinks.

09:49.823 --> 09:53.093
It is a brilliant
and delicious plan.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.363
Okay, let's just pretend that

09:56.463 --> 09:58.598
you've caught me on a good day

09:58.699 --> 10:00.600
and that I am willing to

10:00.701 --> 10:04.104
ignore the gross negligence,
the nepotism,

10:04.204 --> 10:06.006
and the utter ignorance

10:06.106 --> 10:08.508
that has led us
to this idiotic moment.

10:08.608 --> 10:12.112
No, I...
I was not done with that.

10:13.146 --> 10:16.149
Okay, okay. Relax.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.184
What happened this morning?

10:17.284 --> 10:18.418
I was going to my car

10:18.518 --> 10:19.887
like any other morning,

10:19.987 --> 10:21.889
when suddenly,
two guys run up with guns.

10:21.989 --> 10:25.625
I ran over one of their feet
and then I took off.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.327
How does this relate
to the shooting on your boat?

10:27.427 --> 10:28.395
What boat?

10:28.495 --> 10:29.629
Oh, don't start that with me.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.765
I haven't had a boat
in 40 years.

10:31.865 --> 10:34.101
Well there are two dead Russians
on a boat in the Marina

10:34.201 --> 10:35.402
registered in your name.

10:35.502 --> 10:37.104
Any idea why that might be?

10:37.204 --> 10:39.339
Must be...

10:39.439 --> 10:41.675
another Arkady Kolcheck?

10:41.775 --> 10:43.610
Make that coffee.
Good idea.

10:43.711 --> 10:44.845
Irish coffee.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.113
You got it.

10:48.048 --> 10:49.282
Hold the Irish.

10:49.382 --> 10:50.784
All right.
Is this any way

10:50.884 --> 10:53.453
to treat a friend who was
nearly killed today?

10:53.553 --> 10:55.622
"Friend" is a generous term.

10:57.590 --> 11:00.828
Really, I have
no idea about a boat.

11:00.928 --> 11:03.530
I swear on the memory
of my grandmother.

11:03.630 --> 11:05.598
Forgive me, but I find it
hard to believe

11:05.699 --> 11:09.602
that you have zero ideas
as to how this happened.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.672
Hollace,

11:12.773 --> 11:14.674
I am just your typical

11:14.775 --> 11:17.377
retired ex-KGB agent

11:17.477 --> 11:19.146
that defected to America.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.384
Who could possibly want me dead?

11:24.484 --> 11:26.186
<i>If this actually turns out to be</i>

11:26.286 --> 11:27.888
Arkady's boat I'm gonna be
pretty pissed Photos.

11:27.988 --> 11:30.357
about the 20 bucks he owes me.

11:30.457 --> 11:31.859
Notes.
Thanks.

11:31.959 --> 11:32.860
All right.

11:32.960 --> 11:33.861
Two victims.

11:33.961 --> 11:35.628
One gunshot wound
in the head,

11:35.729 --> 11:37.264
one in the chest.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.631
It's a murder-suicide.

11:38.732 --> 11:40.100
At least that's what
the initial report says.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.869
I don't think
it's that clear-cut.

11:41.969 --> 11:43.937
What do you got?
Look at this pooling.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.874
I mean, if this guy
shot himself right here...

11:46.974 --> 11:49.176
why is that wall
completely clean?

11:49.276 --> 11:50.643
There should be spatter.

11:51.478 --> 11:53.180
These bodies were moved.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.849
Well, LAPD didn't find
any security cameras, so it's

11:55.949 --> 11:57.951
possible somebody just moved
the bodies and then took off.

11:58.051 --> 12:00.620
Okay, that's weird
that they wouldn't have

12:00.720 --> 12:03.523
some kind of surveillance
system installed, right?

12:04.992 --> 12:06.760
I mean, what are you thinking,
Nancy Drew?

12:06.860 --> 12:08.962
I'm thinking that
maybe there is one,

12:09.062 --> 12:10.831
just not that someone could see.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.434
Like a hidden camera.
Mm-hmm.

12:14.534 --> 12:15.435
Ooh.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.237
Like, for instance,

12:17.337 --> 12:20.107
a fancy two-way mirror!

12:20.207 --> 12:23.110
Nope.
That's... that is just a...

12:23.210 --> 12:25.012
That is a regular mirror.

12:26.914 --> 12:28.081
What are you doing?

12:28.181 --> 12:30.750
Well, IR cameras
reflect light, right?

12:30.851 --> 12:32.752
So if there is
a hidden camera,

12:32.853 --> 12:36.323
we should be able to catch
the refraction in the lens.

12:37.057 --> 12:38.525
And by the way, we should
always remember to do this

12:38.625 --> 12:39.793
when we stay
at one of your mother's

12:39.893 --> 12:41.661
"vetted" vacation rentals
'cause nowadays

12:41.761 --> 12:43.496
there's hidden cameras everywhere.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.098
Well, I mean, not
everywhere, right?

12:45.198 --> 12:47.134
I mean, let's not
be paranoid, right?

12:47.234 --> 12:49.369
Huh. Vents.
Vents?

12:49.469 --> 12:51.504
Hmm. Clocks.
Clocks?

12:51.604 --> 12:52.639
Showers.
Showers?!

12:52.739 --> 12:55.075
Yep. Oh. Oh.

12:55.175 --> 12:57.410
Smoke detectors.
Smoke detectors.

12:58.211 --> 13:01.348
Oh, Nancy Drew,
you did it again.

13:01.448 --> 13:04.451
I-I'm fine, I promise.

13:04.551 --> 13:06.253
You want to speak with him?

13:08.288 --> 13:09.589
No. He, uh, I-I...

13:09.689 --> 13:11.124
Okay. I'll tell him.

13:11.224 --> 13:13.126
I love you too.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.862
What'd Anna say?

13:14.962 --> 13:17.865
Hmm? Oh, nothing, just...

13:17.965 --> 13:19.466
thank you for saving me,

13:19.566 --> 13:21.334
which you did not do.
I saved myself.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.602
But you did drive me here.

13:22.702 --> 13:24.637
But I must tell you,
I hate this place.

13:24.737 --> 13:25.939
It smells like crab shack.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.740
At least in my safe house

13:27.841 --> 13:29.209
we had blended drinks.
Well, I'll keep that in mind

13:29.309 --> 13:31.378
next time someone
decides to attack you.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.948
Hey, Callen. Rountree.

13:35.048 --> 13:36.383
Fatima.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.485
Kensi and Deeks able to find
anything at the crime scene?

13:38.585 --> 13:40.020
They found surveillance footage

13:40.120 --> 13:43.323
from a camera that was hidden
inside of a smoke detector.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.825
And because of our, uh,

13:45.926 --> 13:47.794
complicated relationship
with this case,

13:47.895 --> 13:51.098
LAPD has asked us
to analyze the footage.

13:51.198 --> 13:54.902
Now, the angle is a little bit
limited, but uh, check it out.

13:57.204 --> 14:01.141
We got gunfire coming from
multiple angles in the room.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.479
Crime scene was
staged postmortem.

14:06.579 --> 14:07.747
Why would they do that?

14:07.847 --> 14:10.317
Uh, I couldn't tell you,
but maybe she can.

14:10.417 --> 14:11.518
Oh,

14:11.618 --> 14:14.154
a survivor.
Any chance we can ID her?

14:14.254 --> 14:16.957
Facial rec got a match for
an INTERPOL red notice for...

14:17.057 --> 14:18.225
Mira.

14:19.759 --> 14:20.827
You know this woman?

14:20.928 --> 14:22.329
Oh.
Biblically.

14:22.429 --> 14:23.997
Uh, yeah.

14:24.097 --> 14:27.000
That's correct,
uh, Miraslava Borisova.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.735
A museum curator from Moscow

14:28.835 --> 14:31.071
turned black market
antiquities dealer.

14:31.171 --> 14:33.506
Back in the day,
she had a different alias

14:33.606 --> 14:36.009
for every city she was in.

14:36.109 --> 14:37.744
She had cheekbones that could
cut your throat.

14:37.844 --> 14:38.778
And legs...

14:38.878 --> 14:40.680
Stop. Please.

14:41.448 --> 14:42.349
How do you know her?

14:42.449 --> 14:44.317
I gave her her start.

14:44.417 --> 14:47.820
She had the access.
I had contacts.

14:47.921 --> 14:50.991
It was symbiotic.
In more ways than one.

14:51.091 --> 14:53.626
Great. Do you think you can
still get in touch with her?

14:53.726 --> 14:56.196
It's been 40 years and...

14:56.296 --> 14:57.697
But, uh...

14:58.698 --> 15:00.300
Uh, yeah, I'll try.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.901
Good. Do it.

15:02.002 --> 15:03.736
Set up a meeting for us.
With you?

15:03.836 --> 15:07.107
She's not going to talk to cops.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.442
Okay.
Then you need to figure out

15:09.542 --> 15:11.945
a way for her to talk with you.

15:12.912 --> 15:15.148
Well, I can do that. Mm.

15:19.953 --> 15:21.354
Who hides out
in Beverly Hills?

15:21.454 --> 15:24.291
She's a woman of taste,
and then she blends in here.

15:24.391 --> 15:26.426
I must admit,
I'm a little nervous.

15:26.526 --> 15:27.794
You're sure you're up for this?

15:27.894 --> 15:28.895
Like I said,

15:28.996 --> 15:31.164
Mira is a very
reasonable person,

15:31.264 --> 15:32.765
but you are you.

15:32.865 --> 15:34.734
I mean, she'll trust me.
Okay, well,

15:34.834 --> 15:36.103
if anything
does go south...

15:36.203 --> 15:38.105
I've been doing this since
before you were born.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.607
Give me some credit.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.215
Miraslava Borisova.

15:48.315 --> 15:49.983
Well, that is a...
that is a mouthful.

15:50.083 --> 15:51.451
He knows her from his KGB days.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.586
Apparently they dated
before he met Anna's mom.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.722
Uh-oh.
Do we know if it ended well?

15:55.822 --> 15:57.390
Don't know. Something about a...

15:57.490 --> 16:00.193
relationship that was hotter
than Bonnie and Clyde, and...

16:00.293 --> 16:02.095
I pretty much stopped
listening at that point.

16:02.195 --> 16:04.364
Yeah, that's fair.
That's actually
when I'd start listening.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.075
Mira?

16:18.811 --> 16:20.147
Oh.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.116
Mira?

16:31.424 --> 16:32.792
Mira?

16:35.695 --> 16:36.663
Mira.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.765
Wow, you look great.
Oh, you...

16:39.832 --> 16:40.867
Uh-oh, here we go.

16:40.967 --> 16:42.235
It's Arkady.

16:43.303 --> 16:44.104
Kolcheck.

16:44.204 --> 16:46.039
I know who the hell you are.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.342
Guys, what's going on in there?

16:49.442 --> 16:50.310
Can't really tell

16:50.410 --> 16:51.611
yet.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.280
40 years.

16:53.380 --> 16:54.581
And you call now,

16:54.681 --> 16:57.717
on the day I nearly died.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.286
Oh.
Sorry, I had to do that,

16:59.386 --> 17:00.587
but you really
need to calm down.

17:02.922 --> 17:04.257
You set me up, didn't you?

17:04.357 --> 17:07.294
Just like you did in Malta. Listen.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.562
They're fighting.
they're definitely fighting.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.030
That is the understatement
of the century.

17:11.131 --> 17:13.266
It's more like a geriatric WWE.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.967
Uh, Callen, do you
want us to go in?

17:15.068 --> 17:17.036
I mean, we could

17:17.137 --> 17:18.705
wait a minute.
Remember the time
he made us

17:18.805 --> 17:20.640
de-rig that car with explosives

17:20.740 --> 17:23.710
because he forgot to mention
he boobytrapped it?

17:23.810 --> 17:25.078
Mm, and do you remember the time

17:25.178 --> 17:26.746
where he screwed over
your mission

17:26.846 --> 17:28.081
in Chechnya?

17:28.181 --> 17:29.749
How about the time
he cursed my engagement?

17:30.983 --> 17:32.185
So maybe we just
give it a minute.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.654
Yeah, just a minute.
40 years

17:34.754 --> 17:35.688
ago!
Listen!

17:35.788 --> 17:37.624
I just... want...

17:37.724 --> 17:39.792
to... chat.

17:39.892 --> 17:43.163
Then you should have
shown up at that dock

17:43.263 --> 17:46.333
like you said you would
40 years ago!

17:46.433 --> 17:48.901
I see you're still upset
and that is fair.

17:49.001 --> 17:50.770
It was miscommunication.

17:50.870 --> 17:52.539
Don't. Put down

17:52.639 --> 17:54.207
the rack.
All right, guys,
now we got to help him.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.508
Let's talk about this,
'cause I really would

17:55.608 --> 17:57.444
like to know
what happened in Malta.

17:57.544 --> 18:01.047
Don't. That is my retirement.
These things

18:01.148 --> 18:02.782
aren't even worth
anything anymore.

18:02.882 --> 18:03.983
Don't, don't, don't!

18:06.419 --> 18:07.254
Ready?

18:07.354 --> 18:08.888
Oh, I'm excited.
Uh-huh.

18:12.292 --> 18:15.094
Oh. Federal agents.

18:18.665 --> 18:20.099
Amicably, huh?

18:21.468 --> 18:22.769
I, uh...

18:22.869 --> 18:26.173
I may have left out
a couple of minor details.

18:42.555 --> 18:43.523
Agent Namazi.

18:43.623 --> 18:44.957
Admiral Kilbride.

18:45.057 --> 18:47.527
I, um... I wanted to
apologize for my tardiness.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.028
Oh, no need.
No need at all.

18:49.128 --> 18:51.831
Agent Rountree's already
told me everything.

18:51.931 --> 18:52.832
Yes, my dog.

18:52.932 --> 18:53.966
Mm.
Yeah. he's feeling

18:54.066 --> 18:55.101
much better.

18:55.202 --> 18:56.536
Oh, that's so good to hear. Yeah.

18:56.636 --> 18:59.071
You know, it might
surprise you to know that

18:59.172 --> 19:02.242
I too have a real
soft spot for dogs. Oh.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.377
Have had ever since I befriended

19:04.477 --> 19:06.446
a whole pack of them
at Cam Ranh Bay.

19:06.546 --> 19:07.680
Mm.

19:07.780 --> 19:09.649
And you might think
this is, uh, kind of

19:09.749 --> 19:12.652
out of character for me,
but I think you ought to

19:12.752 --> 19:14.454
bring your dog
into work with you.

19:14.554 --> 19:15.955
You know, while he recovers.

19:16.055 --> 19:18.791
Oh.
That's not necessary, sir.

19:18.891 --> 19:21.160
He's really doing
much, much better.

19:21.261 --> 19:23.230
Well, good.
I'm glad to hear that. Yeah.

19:23.330 --> 19:26.566
Bring him in anyway.
I'd like to meet him.

19:28.235 --> 19:30.203
Sure, sir.

19:33.706 --> 19:36.409
Well, couldn't
avoid him forever.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.278
Sorry, I panicked.

19:38.378 --> 19:40.580
A dog?
I don't even own a dog.

19:40.680 --> 19:41.914
What am I supposed to do?

19:42.014 --> 19:44.351
How's that
iced coffee tasting now?

19:44.451 --> 19:45.818
Deeks, Kensi.

19:45.918 --> 19:46.986
What do you got for us?

19:47.086 --> 19:48.788
Got some good news
and some bad news.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.557
Bad news is
we still haven't found

19:50.657 --> 19:51.858
anything conclusive
on the shooters.

19:51.958 --> 19:53.660
And the good news?
Good news is

19:53.760 --> 19:54.994
we think we may have identified

19:55.094 --> 19:56.796
the missing object
in question from the yacht.

19:56.896 --> 20:00.132
It's hard to authenticate
without seeing it in person,

20:00.233 --> 20:02.134
but we think it could be one
of eight currently missing

20:02.235 --> 20:03.870
decorative eggs
that was manufactured

20:03.970 --> 20:05.738
for the Russian royal family.

20:05.838 --> 20:07.974
Which puts the piece's
value in the millions.

20:08.074 --> 20:10.176
If Mira's the middleman,
why try to kill her?

20:10.277 --> 20:12.845
Ooh, I think the more
important question is

20:12.945 --> 20:14.981
why come for Arkady
after the fact?

20:15.081 --> 20:17.250
Unless it was about
something more personal.

20:17.350 --> 20:18.651
Uh, Fatima,

20:18.751 --> 20:19.819
send that picture to Callen.
He's in interrogation

20:19.919 --> 20:21.388
with Mira right now.
Will do.

20:21.488 --> 20:23.656
We got to find out how
Arkady ties into all of this.

20:23.756 --> 20:25.758
Where... where is Arkady?

20:25.858 --> 20:27.760
Arkady is on a time-out
on the deck

20:27.860 --> 20:29.462
because him and Mira won't stop

20:29.562 --> 20:30.863
throwing things
at each other

20:30.963 --> 20:32.765
and they need to learn
to use their words!

20:32.865 --> 20:35.768
She started it.
I will finish it.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.273
Miraslava.

20:40.373 --> 20:42.442
You want to tell me what
you were doing with this

20:42.542 --> 20:44.110
on that boat yesterday?

20:44.210 --> 20:46.813
You must have me mistaken
for someone else.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.281
I've never seen that before.

20:48.381 --> 20:49.882
Really?
Mm-hmm.

20:49.982 --> 20:53.219
Because the, uh, surveillance
footage would say otherwise.

20:54.854 --> 20:56.423
What do you want?

20:56.523 --> 20:58.057
That boat you were conducting

20:58.157 --> 21:00.026
unsanctioned sales
on yesterday--

21:00.126 --> 21:02.329
it's registered
in Arkady's name.

21:02.429 --> 21:03.463
Why-why is that?

21:03.563 --> 21:05.097
No idea.

21:05.197 --> 21:07.867
Perhaps you should ask
Mr. Smirnoff Ice himself.

21:07.967 --> 21:10.202
I did. And he
didn't know either.

21:10.303 --> 21:13.340
So I guess I'll just
contact the DOJ

21:13.440 --> 21:14.974
and see if the Task Force
KleptoCapture has

21:15.074 --> 21:16.409
any interest in
this Russian yacht.

21:16.509 --> 21:18.277
Okay, okay.

21:18.378 --> 21:19.746
It's my boat.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.248
I'm listening.

21:25.518 --> 21:29.188
Arkady is my de jure
business partner.

21:29.288 --> 21:31.123
I've been putting
his name on everything

21:31.223 --> 21:33.993
from lock boxes to condos
from here to Cape Town.

21:35.362 --> 21:37.597
As far as the world
is concerned...

21:38.498 --> 21:42.669
...he's been working with me
behind the curtain for, hmm...

21:42.769 --> 21:44.036
40 years?

21:44.136 --> 21:45.372
Hmm.

21:45.472 --> 21:47.640
Why have an alias
when you can have revenge.

21:47.740 --> 21:51.411
It's petty, but effective.

21:51.511 --> 21:52.879
Mm-hmm.

21:55.081 --> 21:58.084
Arkady was attacked
this morning.

21:59.151 --> 22:01.087
Most likely because
you've convinced the world

22:01.187 --> 22:03.823
that the two of you
are in business together.

22:03.923 --> 22:06.359
That little stunt of yours
almost got him killed.

22:07.960 --> 22:11.030
Admittedly, it's, uh,
a hazard of his career.

22:11.130 --> 22:13.900
The fake career that
you created for him?

22:14.701 --> 22:16.168
Those men are still out there.

22:16.268 --> 22:19.138
As far as they're concerned,
I'm dead.

22:19.238 --> 22:20.373
So what do I care?

22:21.173 --> 22:23.476
Because they're
still after Arkady.

22:23.576 --> 22:26.178
This may be over for you
but he is still in danger.

22:29.449 --> 22:32.419
Well, I suppose he has helped me
make a lot of money.

22:32.519 --> 22:33.720
Some money.

22:33.820 --> 22:36.188
Completely legal money.

22:37.156 --> 22:38.324
In Colombia.

22:43.996 --> 22:46.599
These men-- they're new clients.

22:46.699 --> 22:49.402
I never met the buyer before.

22:49.502 --> 22:52.004
But since they were vetted
by the auction house,

22:52.104 --> 22:54.907
well, I-I didn't
pay much attention to it.

22:55.007 --> 22:57.376
You're a fence. Why would
you need an auction house?

22:58.244 --> 23:02.048
Antiquities require
museum-level care.

23:02.148 --> 23:05.184
You can't just expect
da Vinci's <i>Codex Leicester</i>

23:05.284 --> 23:09.422
to survive in Big Bob's
public storage locker.

23:09.522 --> 23:12.058
Were they the only ones
that knew about the sale?

23:13.259 --> 23:17.229
Them. Well, and,
of course, the seller.

23:18.330 --> 23:21.568
Alexey Pasternik.

23:21.668 --> 23:24.036
He was very motivated.

23:24.136 --> 23:26.973
Wanted to move the piece fast.

23:27.073 --> 23:29.942
So Pasternik needed cash
and he needed it quickly.

23:30.042 --> 23:32.078
And if you want my opinion...

23:33.546 --> 23:35.648
..."moving fast" is equivalent

23:35.748 --> 23:38.050
to a discount in the millions.

23:38.150 --> 23:40.453
In this industry, that means

23:40.553 --> 23:43.756
there's something wrong
with your seller.

23:51.130 --> 23:53.700
Yo, Fatima. Hey.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.101
You got anything?

23:55.201 --> 23:56.936
Yeah.
Thanks to our girl Mira,

23:57.036 --> 23:58.605
I was able to
track down Pasternik,

23:58.705 --> 24:00.873
our OG egg owner.
Yeah?

24:00.973 --> 24:02.875
Get this: he just died
three days ago.

24:02.975 --> 24:04.477
What?
Yeah.

24:04.577 --> 24:07.747
He threw himself through
a closed glass window

24:07.847 --> 24:10.349
on the 12th floor
of a condo complex.

24:10.449 --> 24:12.084
Please tell me
how's that possible.

24:12.184 --> 24:15.021
Okay, another suspicious death?

24:15.121 --> 24:16.923
That's like what happened
on the boat this morning.

24:17.023 --> 24:18.324
Yeah.
I'm starting to think

24:18.424 --> 24:20.426
this isn't just
some dark coincidence.

24:20.527 --> 24:24.063
Actually, I think it's
a pattern. Check this out.

24:24.163 --> 24:26.566
Okay, this is a flight map
of all the private jets

24:26.666 --> 24:28.434
that left Russia on February 22.

24:28.535 --> 24:32.204
Now, this is all of the private
jets that left on the 24th,

24:32.304 --> 24:33.673
the day of the Ukraine invasion.

24:33.773 --> 24:35.274
So at the first sign of war,

24:35.374 --> 24:37.176
we have all these billionaires
taking their money

24:37.276 --> 24:38.845
and running all over the world.
Mm-hmm.

24:38.945 --> 24:40.079
Including L.A.

24:40.179 --> 24:41.480
This is where it gets
real interesting.

24:41.581 --> 24:43.482
Out of all the oligarchs
that ran on the 24th,

24:43.583 --> 24:46.418
more than half
have faced untimely deaths.

24:46.519 --> 24:47.687
Within a year.

24:47.787 --> 24:49.121
Half?
Half.

24:49.221 --> 24:52.825
Honestly, this
reminds me of something.

24:52.925 --> 24:54.326
Do you remember
that rogue group

24:54.426 --> 24:56.095
and what happened to all those
frontline workers in China

24:56.195 --> 24:58.297
when they tried to
blow the whistle on COVID-19?

24:58.397 --> 25:00.933
Who knew hospital windows
were so dangerous. Yeah.

25:01.033 --> 25:02.969
They're doing
their own dirty work.

25:03.069 --> 25:05.171
I'm calling Callen. Yeah.

25:10.677 --> 25:14.146
Your, uh, client,
Alexey Pasternik, is dead.

25:17.149 --> 25:19.586
"Fell" out of
a 12th story window.

25:21.487 --> 25:22.655
Well, that is why

25:22.755 --> 25:25.491
I am a ground-floor kind of gal.

25:25.592 --> 25:26.759
Too many flying Russians.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.828
Well, actually,
falling Russians.

25:28.928 --> 25:30.229
You know, honestly,

25:30.329 --> 25:32.531
I think our national bird
should be the dodo.

25:32.632 --> 25:35.067
Look, you said he was trying
to sell his egg fast.

25:35.167 --> 25:36.302
He needed cash.

25:36.402 --> 25:37.970
Who's he trying to
get away from?

25:38.771 --> 25:40.506
Not who...

25:40.607 --> 25:41.974
but what.

25:42.975 --> 25:44.343
For years now,

25:44.443 --> 25:45.978
it's been believed
that the Russian government

25:46.078 --> 25:49.081
has siphoned the money
to its party members,

25:49.181 --> 25:52.619
oligarchs whose loyalties
have been bought.

25:53.519 --> 25:55.354
Or so they thought.

25:55.454 --> 25:57.123
But now that sanctions
are tightening

25:57.223 --> 26:00.627
and they are in desperate need
of cash flow, well...

26:02.094 --> 26:04.030
Those oligarchs finally see

26:04.130 --> 26:07.233
what that money
was really meant for.

26:07.333 --> 26:08.701
Which is?

26:08.801 --> 26:10.937
They're blood banks.

26:11.037 --> 26:14.340
A living, breathing fund
for the government

26:14.440 --> 26:17.977
to hide wealth in. And...

26:18.077 --> 26:21.814
for those whose loyalties
are in question,

26:21.914 --> 26:23.850
it's time to make a withdrawal.

26:24.817 --> 26:27.687
Why are they after Arkady?
He's not an oligarch.

26:27.787 --> 26:29.488
Mm... No.

26:29.588 --> 26:32.625
But he is the head
of my operation.

26:32.725 --> 26:36.328
And they didn't like the way
you-- and by proxy Arkady-- were

26:36.428 --> 26:38.364
liquidating Pasternik's assets

26:38.464 --> 26:40.633
before they could
collect on him.

26:40.733 --> 26:42.635
Mm...

26:42.735 --> 26:44.070
Among others.

26:45.004 --> 26:46.739
<i>Am I getting this right</i>

26:46.839 --> 26:48.407
in saying that
someone within Russia

26:48.507 --> 26:50.076
is putting a hit
on their own oligarchs?

26:50.176 --> 26:51.543
So, party members
were fed for years

26:51.644 --> 26:53.379
knowing those funds
were reclaimable, right?

26:53.479 --> 26:55.114
And then once those
blood banks die,

26:55.214 --> 26:56.783
the private estate reverts
back to the motherland.

26:56.883 --> 26:59.485
And so if that was happening
to several of Mira's clients,

26:59.585 --> 27:01.587
no wonder they
put a hit on her, too.

27:01.688 --> 27:03.589
I mean, she was liquidating
the targets' assets.

27:03.690 --> 27:06.192
Ultimately stealing funds
from the national nest egg.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.327
Fatima's theory is correct.

27:08.427 --> 27:11.230
That these recent suspicious
deaths are actually murders.

27:11.330 --> 27:12.765
All of it--
moving the bodies, uh,

27:12.865 --> 27:15.167
Pasternik taking a header
off the 12th floor-- I mean,

27:15.267 --> 27:18.004
all of it was set up to hide
what was really happening.

27:18.104 --> 27:19.505
Deeks, those flight maps

27:19.605 --> 27:22.241
show that this
is not just isolated to L.A.

27:23.242 --> 27:25.177
This is happening
all over the world.

27:26.378 --> 27:28.681
This is so much bigger
than we thought.

27:39.658 --> 27:40.827
Agent Deeks, Agent Blye.

27:40.927 --> 27:42.829
Sir.
Admiral. Any news?

27:42.929 --> 27:46.632
I spoke with the
KleptoCapture task force.

27:46.733 --> 27:49.836
They, unfortunately,
will not be assisting

27:49.936 --> 27:52.204
any further
in our investigation.

27:52.304 --> 27:53.873
What about the DOJ?
Their official statement

27:53.973 --> 27:57.676
is they are
exploring allegations

27:57.777 --> 28:00.179
of transnational efforts

28:00.279 --> 28:02.614
by a certain unnamed country

28:02.715 --> 28:06.118
to reclaim assets
of their citizens,

28:06.218 --> 28:08.788
and that some
associated deaths

28:08.888 --> 28:10.489
have, in fact,
been reported.

28:10.589 --> 28:12.258
Okay, and the
unofficial statement?

28:12.358 --> 28:15.694
Russia's getting backed into
a corner on the world stage.

28:15.795 --> 28:17.930
They will never admit defeat

28:18.030 --> 28:20.699
and each day that goes by,

28:20.800 --> 28:24.203
their options to end
the conflict in Ukraine dwindle.

28:24.303 --> 28:27.874
And right now
there is growing fear

28:27.974 --> 28:31.710
that tactical nukes
are not entirely off the table.

28:31.811 --> 28:34.713
In other words, they
appreciate our limited

28:34.814 --> 28:36.749
and discreet involvement.

28:36.849 --> 28:38.885
And to add insult to injury,

28:38.985 --> 28:40.887
Agent Callen has being pulled.

28:40.987 --> 28:43.122
We received
the phone call

28:43.222 --> 28:44.690
we'd been expecting.

28:44.791 --> 28:48.160
He is to join Hanna's joint
task force undercover operation.

28:48.260 --> 28:50.329
Now?
As soon as
he is finished

28:50.429 --> 28:53.332
in interrogation, there
is a plane waiting for him.

28:53.966 --> 28:55.701
We haven't been able
to ID the gunman yet.

28:55.802 --> 28:56.903
How are we supposed
to find them?

28:57.003 --> 28:59.071
Well, maybe we don't
have to, you know?

28:59.171 --> 29:01.808
The auction house owner that
set Mira up with the sale

29:01.908 --> 29:03.409
is the only other person
that knows about it

29:03.509 --> 29:05.978
and so therefore the most
likely person to have ratted out

29:06.078 --> 29:07.346
Mira and Arkady.

29:07.446 --> 29:09.248
Which means that they
would know who the gunmen are

29:09.348 --> 29:10.716
and how to contact them.

29:10.817 --> 29:12.318
Right, so the auction
house owner thinks that

29:12.418 --> 29:14.686
Mira and Arkady
are still partners.
Uh-huh.

29:14.787 --> 29:17.189
So let's just say Arkady
goes to the auction house

29:17.289 --> 29:19.025
under the pretense
he needs to pull

29:19.125 --> 29:20.827
something for
a client and...

29:20.927 --> 29:23.295
And then our rat
might strike again.

29:23.395 --> 29:24.363
And we'll have our guys. Ah.

29:30.036 --> 29:31.971
Why are you looking
at me like that?

29:35.341 --> 29:36.542
Mm.

29:36.642 --> 29:40.779
I'll do it.
But I have a few notes.

29:40.880 --> 29:43.715
<i>For this to work,
you need my ears.</i>

29:43.816 --> 29:48.087
<i>Without guidance, you aren't
getting a step into that place.</i>

29:48.187 --> 29:51.023
<i>They can smell a trap
a mile away.</i>

29:51.123 --> 29:53.692
<i>The client is going to need
to be important,</i>

29:53.792 --> 29:56.428
<i>someone you bend rules for.</i>

29:56.528 --> 29:59.565
<i>Luckily for you, I have many.</i>

29:59.665 --> 30:02.768
Rodgers and Hammerstein called.
They want their costume back.

30:02.869 --> 30:03.936
Oh, how dare you?

30:04.036 --> 30:05.872
I'm a member
of the Swedish nobility.

30:05.972 --> 30:09.842
<i>Most importantly,
remember what this place is.</i>

30:09.942 --> 30:12.311
<i>It protects objects, not humans.</i>

30:12.411 --> 30:14.346
<i>You don't want to
get stuck somewhere</i>

30:14.446 --> 30:17.483
<i>if the fire suppression
system goes off.</i>

30:17.583 --> 30:18.885
Trust me.

30:18.985 --> 30:20.519
And what is it that
you want in exchange?

30:20.619 --> 30:22.721
A second chance.

30:32.131 --> 30:35.667
An Agent Castor arrived
with your jacket.

30:35.767 --> 30:38.170
Thank you.
You are out?

30:38.270 --> 30:41.273
Mm. Good behavior.

30:43.209 --> 30:45.844
You never got
any better at that?

30:45.945 --> 30:47.980
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk,
tsk, tsk, tsk.

30:48.080 --> 30:49.348
Oh, you--

30:49.448 --> 30:53.052
the man who single-handedly
drank the Louvre curator

30:53.152 --> 30:56.022
out of the real <i>Amore e Psiche.</i>

30:56.122 --> 30:57.589
Remember getting it
down the stairs?

30:57.689 --> 30:58.925
I still have back pain.
Oh, well,

30:59.025 --> 31:01.093
you weren't the one
doing it in heels.

31:01.193 --> 31:03.462
What did you say
to those officers?

31:03.562 --> 31:05.131
"Bonsoir, officers,

31:05.231 --> 31:08.267
the gift shop--
they ran out of large bags."

31:14.173 --> 31:16.008
Mira...

31:16.909 --> 31:18.978
About Malta,

31:19.078 --> 31:21.013
I should have believed you.

31:22.214 --> 31:23.715
The necklace was not worth...

31:23.815 --> 31:24.850
Shh.

31:24.951 --> 31:26.885
Today I almost got you killed.

31:27.753 --> 31:30.356
Let's just call us even.

31:30.456 --> 31:32.058
Even?

31:33.025 --> 31:36.128
There.
That should do it. Mm?

31:38.864 --> 31:41.667
Oh...

31:41.767 --> 31:43.902
Oh, that smile.

31:45.972 --> 31:48.174
It never aged a bit.

31:49.008 --> 31:52.411
And now for the finishing touch.
Oh?

31:52.511 --> 31:54.580
I requested something special

31:54.680 --> 31:56.682
to help you get into character.

31:59.451 --> 32:01.187
Behold...

32:02.521 --> 32:05.324
...the real Arkady Kolcheck.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.093
Oh, groovy!

32:08.227 --> 32:12.098
♪ There lived a certain man
in Russia long ago ♪

32:12.198 --> 32:15.301
♪ He was big and strong,
in his eyes a flaming glow ♪

Rupert is expecting me.

32:40.259 --> 32:42.228
Rupert is expecting me.

32:43.229 --> 32:44.463
It's for account

32:44.563 --> 32:45.664
822...

32:45.764 --> 32:47.466
0037.

32:47.566 --> 32:49.001
For account 822...

32:49.101 --> 32:51.503
0037.
Of course.

32:51.603 --> 32:54.273
But your bodyguard will
have to stay outside.

32:54.373 --> 32:56.508
Company policy.
Follow me.

33:00.379 --> 33:01.847
<i>Fatima, anything?</i>

33:01.947 --> 33:03.782
No. Rupert's dragging his feet.

33:03.882 --> 33:05.151
He still hasn't made the call.

33:05.251 --> 33:07.286
That is so weird.
What is he waiting for?

33:09.655 --> 33:11.923
Mr. Kolcheck,
in the flesh.

33:12.024 --> 33:14.260
I have to say
I've worked with Miraslava

33:14.360 --> 33:16.062
for years on your behalf,
but never imagined

33:16.162 --> 33:17.763
I'd have the pleasure
of meeting you in person.

33:17.863 --> 33:19.231
Well, my client deserved

33:19.331 --> 33:22.201
special escort. I mean,
he did come long way for this.

33:22.301 --> 33:23.469
Yes.

33:34.580 --> 33:35.781
<i>Ja.</i>

33:35.881 --> 33:38.717
I studied abroad
in Stockholm years ago.

33:38.817 --> 33:42.154
I still remember the little
day trips to Tyresta.

33:44.290 --> 33:45.457
<i>Ja.</i>

33:47.426 --> 33:48.760
Well...

33:48.860 --> 33:50.796
Mr. Kolcheck, if you'll just
follow my assistant,

33:50.896 --> 33:51.963
uh, she'll take you
to your lockbox

33:52.064 --> 33:53.665
to procure your item.

33:53.765 --> 33:55.601
Under the circumstances,

33:55.701 --> 33:57.703
I mean, could you have them
bring it out to us?

33:57.803 --> 33:59.871
Well, I'm afraid you will have
to use your personal key.

33:59.971 --> 34:03.209
But don't worry, I'll entertain
your guest till you get back.

34:04.843 --> 34:06.245
Vault number two.

34:07.646 --> 34:09.014
<i>Ja.</i>

34:15.921 --> 34:17.156
<i>Skol.</i>

34:17.256 --> 34:18.790
Look, no one mentioned a key.

34:18.890 --> 34:20.292
Mira? Hello?

34:20.392 --> 34:21.860
I lost Mira.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.395
Fatima, can you check her comms?

34:23.495 --> 34:24.996
It says it's still connected.

34:25.097 --> 34:26.365
What about Castor?
I'm not getting

34:26.465 --> 34:28.634
an answer
from Castor's cell either.

34:38.144 --> 34:39.645
You may enter.

34:52.758 --> 34:54.260
Oh.

34:54.360 --> 34:56.195
Oh.

34:58.297 --> 35:00.266
Hello, <i>Rad'noy.</i>

35:12.178 --> 35:14.413
Guys, I'm still not
getting through to Castor.

35:14.513 --> 35:16.148
Arkady, come in.

35:17.249 --> 35:18.717
Arkady?

35:18.817 --> 35:20.352
I lost Arkady's comms.

35:20.452 --> 35:21.720
Something's up.
I'm going in.

35:21.820 --> 35:23.589
Copy that.
I'll head in through the back.

35:27.459 --> 35:31.497
And I thought I was going to
have to kill you twice.

35:32.831 --> 35:34.900
I'm sorry, Arkachev.

35:35.000 --> 35:38.470
One has to go where the
business opportunities are.

35:38.570 --> 35:42.140
Immunity and a modest profit

35:42.241 --> 35:44.210
in exchange for you

35:44.310 --> 35:46.845
and our client list.

35:46.945 --> 35:48.180
Well,

35:48.280 --> 35:50.849
that's far better than prison,
don't you agree?

35:54.052 --> 35:55.187
The deal?

36:03.229 --> 36:04.463
Aim for the head.

36:04.563 --> 36:06.632
Don't make the same
mistake I did.

36:13.071 --> 36:14.740
Duck!

36:20.679 --> 36:21.813
Is that the fire alarm?

36:21.913 --> 36:22.814
Worse. It's the CO2

36:22.914 --> 36:24.283
suppression system.

36:27.253 --> 36:29.120
It's probably coming from
one of these storage facilities.

36:29.221 --> 36:32.057
Where Arkady is?
CO2 levels only need to be

36:32.157 --> 36:34.226
seven percent of the air
for someone to suffocate.

36:34.326 --> 36:36.862
In a room that tight,
that could happen in minutes.

36:36.962 --> 36:38.897
Awesome.

36:38.997 --> 36:40.899
Arkady, get away from the door!

36:48.374 --> 36:49.375
Aah!

36:52.578 --> 36:54.313
Arkady!

37:07.526 --> 37:10.061
I have eyes on
Arkady, but they're surrounded.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.769
"They?"

37:34.052 --> 37:35.387
Hey.

37:45.531 --> 37:47.399
Oh, <i>ja.</i>

38:01.780 --> 38:04.015
All right.

38:04.115 --> 38:05.784
I could use
a little help here, guys.

38:05.884 --> 38:07.285
I'm heading to you now.

38:08.086 --> 38:10.088
Kensi!
What is she going
to do with that?

38:15.226 --> 38:16.161
Oh, never mind.

38:31.109 --> 38:32.210
Throw it.

38:35.814 --> 38:37.082
Stay down!

38:37.182 --> 38:39.818
Kens, you okay?
Yeah. You're a little late.

38:41.487 --> 38:44.356
Did you take this guy
with a serving platter?

38:44.456 --> 38:46.224
Listen, there isn't much time.

38:46.324 --> 38:48.827
I will distract them
and you make run for it.

38:48.927 --> 38:50.362
Not this time.

38:56.868 --> 38:58.904
We'll always have Malta.

39:06.311 --> 39:08.380
All right.
So, what are we thinking--

39:08.480 --> 39:10.382
tacos or... Ooh.

39:10.482 --> 39:11.583
Maybe we switch it up,

39:11.683 --> 39:13.452
head to Sawtelle
for some udon, mm?

39:13.552 --> 39:16.154
I'm actually
gonna have to pass.
What?

39:16.254 --> 39:19.525
I have plans with a new friend.

39:19.625 --> 39:21.259
A new friend?

39:21.359 --> 39:22.761
Mm-hmm.

39:22.861 --> 39:24.062
I actually met her at
the coffee shop this morning.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.965
Well, at least something good
came out of it.

39:27.065 --> 39:28.800
Yeah, seriously.

39:28.900 --> 39:30.502
Hey, you know what?

39:30.602 --> 39:33.939
I might have found a solution
for our little problem, okay?

39:34.039 --> 39:35.340
Oh.
Hear me out.

39:35.441 --> 39:36.542
There's this shelter,

39:36.642 --> 39:38.009
and they actually let you

39:38.109 --> 39:39.511
walk the foster dogs.

39:39.611 --> 39:41.847
So what I'm thinking is...
I'm just gonna tell him.

39:41.947 --> 39:43.915
I mean, we can't
keep doing this forever.

39:44.850 --> 39:46.317
Admiral Kilbride, I...

39:46.418 --> 39:49.721
Your espionage training
really shone through today.

39:49.821 --> 39:52.424
I...
Oh, that...

39:54.359 --> 39:55.927
Uh...
Uh...

39:56.027 --> 39:59.598
Just get here on time
from now on, Agent Namazi.

39:59.698 --> 40:02.267
Doesn't take much of a sleuth
to figure out

40:02.367 --> 40:05.136
where all those empty
Frappuccino cups

40:05.236 --> 40:07.172
in Ops are
coming from.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.177
I'll let you
hang on to that.

40:13.178 --> 40:14.980
Damn it.

40:15.847 --> 40:17.215
Hey.

40:18.183 --> 40:20.519
Mira asked me to give you this.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.923
Her retirement.
Oh, yeah?

40:26.124 --> 40:27.893
Have you spoken
with Grisha?

40:27.993 --> 40:29.427
No. He's deep undercover,

40:29.528 --> 40:32.097
but we'll get word to him
as soon as we can.

40:33.532 --> 40:34.900
Are you gonna be okay?

40:35.000 --> 40:37.235
Me? Of course.

40:37.335 --> 40:41.239
I have Anna, Grisha.
My family.

40:42.541 --> 40:46.011
No matter how
dysfunctional we may be,

40:46.111 --> 40:48.680
I would not rewrite
one moment of my life

40:48.780 --> 40:50.582
if it meant losing them.

40:51.650 --> 40:54.385
I happen to know that
they feel the exact same way.

40:57.255 --> 41:01.059
And besides,
Mira is never really gone.

41:01.159 --> 41:02.427
Oh?

41:02.528 --> 41:04.362
Every time my credit
score goes down,

41:04.462 --> 41:07.465
I know she is taking out
a new account in my name.

41:09.735 --> 41:13.672
But more importantly,
she is thinking about me.

41:13.772 --> 41:15.974
Oh. Okay.

41:16.074 --> 41:18.009
So, she never
figured out

41:18.109 --> 41:20.411
that that thing
is completely worthless?

41:20.512 --> 41:23.048
Mm.

41:46.504 --> 41:47.873
Mira.

42:00.318 --> 42:01.987
Mm... no.

42:02.087 --> 42:04.022
Too expensive.

42:16.301 --> 42:17.836
Anna?

42:17.936 --> 42:20.038
How is my favorite daughter?

42:20.138 --> 42:21.506
About the wedding.

42:21.607 --> 42:24.910
I have a new idea
about the open bar...
