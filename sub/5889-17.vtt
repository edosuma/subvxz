00:06.480 --> 00:10.371
- This is the third one this month.
- I'm well aware of that.

00:10.560 --> 00:13.131
I wasn't brought on for this.

00:13.360 --> 00:15.806
I thought we agreed
I'm just supposed to find them.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.890
- Things change, Loyd.
- I need you to be more careful.

00:19.120 --> 00:22.169
Are you telling me how to do my job?

00:23.320 --> 00:24.560
I'm warning you.

00:24.760 --> 00:27.240
One or two more of these
experiments goes south...

00:27.440 --> 00:30.091
...and someone's gonna get wind
of what we're doing here.

00:30.280 --> 00:33.329
And you're being well compensated
to take on that risk, Loyd...

00:33.520 --> 00:38.321
...but if you're telling me that you'd rather
not continue, we will find somebody else.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.889
Is that what you'd prefer?

00:57.240 --> 00:59.641
- License and registration, please.
- Evening, officer.

00:59.840 --> 01:01.842
- Evening.
- Sure. No problem.

01:02.080 --> 01:03.844
What are you hauling here?

01:04.239 --> 01:05.446
Produce.

01:06.640 --> 01:09.166
- And where to?
- Sanborn.

01:09.360 --> 01:10.521
Sanborn, huh?

01:10.720 --> 01:13.929
You aware that this highway's
a drug-smuggling route into Ontario?

01:14.120 --> 01:15.804
- Wouldn't know about that.
- Good.

01:16.000 --> 01:20.085
Then you wouldn't mind me taking a look
in the back of the vehicle, would you?

01:24.280 --> 01:26.726
You wanna remove the sheet, please?

01:29.640 --> 01:30.687
What the...?

01:44.640 --> 01:45.687
Don't...

02:42.240 --> 02:44.561
Honey, what's wrong?

02:44.760 --> 02:46.125
You left your cane.

02:46.320 --> 02:47.367
I didn't need it.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.329
For the first time in...

02:49.640 --> 02:52.484
...I don't know how long, Char,
I just got up and walked.

02:52.640 --> 02:55.769
- Ha-ha-ha. Oh...
- Just a few steps. Hurt like hell.

02:55.960 --> 02:59.009
- The treatment?
- It's working.

02:59.240 --> 03:02.164
After the attack,
I didn't think I'd ever be the same...

03:02.360 --> 03:06.843
...and after the diagnosis...
- You heard the doctor. Tumor's shrinking.

03:07.080 --> 03:09.162
And it's working.

03:13.040 --> 03:16.601
- Don't hang up. I'm in trouble.
- The judge cleared you of everything.

03:16.840 --> 03:18.490
It's not about the harbormaster.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.081
I can't.

03:20.280 --> 03:23.329
When Reddington blew my cover,
he exposed me to dangerous people.

03:23.520 --> 03:26.364
They're looking for me. The guy who
places me, I can't get in touch.

03:26.600 --> 03:29.285
- Tom...
- And these people, these Germans...

03:30.640 --> 03:31.687
- Hold on.
- Get in.

03:31.880 --> 03:34.167
- Where you been? How'd you find me?
- If I can, they can.

03:34.400 --> 03:37.006
They flagged you leaving Dresden.
Your passports are burned.

03:37.200 --> 03:40.044
- Throw me the bag.
- I gotta go, but I'll be all right.

03:40.280 --> 03:41.805
- Gotta leave.
- One second.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.445
- Now.
- I know what today is.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.369
Have fun at Wing Yee's tonight.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.282
Goodbye, Tom.

04:05.920 --> 04:08.890
- What's this?
- You don't remember, do you?

04:09.080 --> 04:10.570
What?

04:10.760 --> 04:12.603
The grapevines.

04:12.800 --> 04:14.723
The ones you and Sam harvested.

04:15.920 --> 04:17.922
Of course. I remember.

04:18.120 --> 04:20.964
Along the garden fence,
we would pick...

04:22.600 --> 04:23.886
Is this from...?

04:24.080 --> 04:28.005
A bottle of wine you made with Sam
when you were a child.

04:29.800 --> 04:32.087
Happy Birthday, Lizzy.

04:32.720 --> 04:37.965
You've become everything Sam
dreamed you would and more.

04:38.520 --> 04:40.522
Share it with someone special.

04:41.120 --> 04:43.930
That said,
it's probably undrinkable by now...

04:44.120 --> 04:47.567
...so I also brought you
an '82 Brunello as a backup.

04:49.280 --> 04:52.682
Thirty-one. No offense, but that's old.

04:52.880 --> 04:57.442
My yogi tells me that time doesn't exist.
He fully intends to live forever.

04:57.640 --> 05:00.371
And tragically, he's not the only one.

05:00.520 --> 05:04.411
Tell me, what do you know
about the Longevity Initiative?

05:04.840 --> 05:06.001
I haven't heard of it.

05:06.240 --> 05:12.486
It's a private company dedicated
to extending human life indefinitely...

05:12.680 --> 05:15.763
...funded by none other
than Roger Hobbs.

05:16.160 --> 05:19.164
- The tech billionaire?
- Yes. He started years ago.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.840
I know because
he offered me the opportunity...

05:22.040 --> 05:25.408
...to invest as a founding partner
in the project.

05:25.600 --> 05:26.806
I passed.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.889
You know Roger Hobbs personally?

05:29.080 --> 05:32.641
Roger is considerably smarter
than the above-average bear...

05:32.840 --> 05:34.251
...and now...

05:34.440 --> 05:37.125
...it appears he may also be as deadly.

05:37.320 --> 05:39.687
You're aware of
the New York State trooper...

05:39.880 --> 05:42.247
...gunned down last night
in the line of duty?

05:42.480 --> 05:46.246
Suspect's still missing but they found
mutilated bodies in the back of the truck.

05:46.440 --> 05:49.842
Not mutilated. Experimented on.

05:50.040 --> 05:54.250
The Longevity Initiative has entered
the human-trial phase.

05:54.440 --> 05:57.489
If they've made a breakthrough,
they need to test it.

05:57.680 --> 05:58.727
On innocent victims.

05:58.960 --> 06:00.883
With any luck, I'll be dead wrong.

06:01.080 --> 06:06.246
Perhaps you'll have a better sense
once you've spoken with Roger Hobbs.

06:07.240 --> 06:08.526
Sorry to bother you at home.

06:08.760 --> 06:12.287
Actually, the Longevity Initiative does
not have any dedicated office space.

06:12.480 --> 06:14.164
We fund research all over the world.

06:14.360 --> 06:16.203
- How many employees?
- A thousand.

06:16.400 --> 06:20.007
- All doing research on immortality?
- Sounds like science fiction, I know...

06:20.200 --> 06:21.611
...but it's all grounded work.

06:21.800 --> 06:24.121
to solve the death riddle.

06:24.360 --> 06:26.601
To do that, we target the issue
from every angle.

06:26.800 --> 06:30.202
We support unproven advanced
genetic technologies...

06:30.400 --> 06:32.402
...the mainstream establishment
won't touch.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.968
Simply, we are trying to extend the life
of the body as long as possible.

06:36.200 --> 06:38.885
Let's talk about the three bodies,
all with craniotomies...

06:39.120 --> 06:40.804
...smuggled in the back of a truck?

06:41.040 --> 06:44.010
What are the chances we connect
those dead bodies back to you...

06:44.200 --> 06:46.168
...and your experiment?

06:46.360 --> 06:49.204
You can't possibly think
one of my scientists was responsible.

06:49.400 --> 06:51.880
There is speculation
that some of your employees...

06:52.080 --> 06:53.809
...might've thought it was time
for human trials.

06:55.120 --> 06:58.090
I mean, look. I have enough lawyers
on speed dial to fill a stadium.

06:58.280 --> 07:01.489
I'm here talking to you because
this project means everything to me.

07:01.680 --> 07:02.806
We have nothing to hide.

07:03.280 --> 07:05.362
We'll need a list of all
of your researchers.

07:05.560 --> 07:07.801
Done. You have my full cooperation.

07:08.000 --> 07:10.685
That was the M.E.'s office.
We have to go. Thank you.

07:10.880 --> 07:13.042
- Thank you for your time.
- Mm-hm.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.487
You were right.
These people were experimented on.

07:16.680 --> 07:19.286
All three victims died
during a neurosurgical procedure.

07:19.480 --> 07:20.640
- For what purpose?
- Unclear.

07:20.760 --> 07:23.127
Foreign cells
were introduced into their brains.

07:23.320 --> 07:25.209
- What kinds?
- Some were fetal stem cells.

07:25.400 --> 07:28.802
- Some were, well, not human.
- Bizarre.

07:29.000 --> 07:32.607
When the bodies came in, they all had
catastrophic damage to the frontal lobe.

07:32.840 --> 07:35.684
I thought it was caused by
the experiment that killed them...

07:35.880 --> 07:39.521
...but then, I got an ID
of one of the victims and pfft.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.087
- Experiments didn't cause brain damage.
- No.

07:42.280 --> 07:44.009
You're looking at William Eckhoff.

07:44.200 --> 07:46.123
He was in a skiing accident.
Multiple fractures.

07:46.360 --> 07:48.886
Most importantly, a traumatic
brain injury. Couldn't speak.

07:49.080 --> 07:51.287
He was reported missing
three days ago...

07:51.480 --> 07:54.882
...from a care facility in Hagerstown.
- Who would abduct a defenseless...

07:55.120 --> 07:57.851
...disabled man
and subject him to such cruelty?

07:58.080 --> 08:01.289
What did you do? Why am I looking
at my patients on every newscast?

08:01.760 --> 08:05.651
I could care less about your patients.
I murdered a cop.

08:06.560 --> 08:07.607
I don't believe this.

08:07.840 --> 08:10.684
I told you if we kept going,
we'd attract unwanted attention.

08:10.920 --> 08:13.924
I'm gone. I'm leaving the country.
You do the same.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.360
I can't do that.

08:15.560 --> 08:17.881
I have to go. I'm with a patient.

08:19.360 --> 08:21.203
Well, then...

08:22.080 --> 08:23.730
...let's continue.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.449
Tell me your name, please.

08:34.640 --> 08:37.644
There we go. Let's try that again.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.126
Tell me your name.

08:44.640 --> 08:47.291
Tell me your name.

08:48.560 --> 08:54.283
Come on. You can try harder.
Tell me your name, please.

08:55.280 --> 08:57.442
Tell me your name!

08:57.920 --> 08:59.410
That's it. Tell me your name.

09:03.200 --> 09:04.850
Get in here. She's seizing.

09:16.760 --> 09:19.491
- Is this a bad time?
- Of course not. Have a seat.

09:19.680 --> 09:21.967
You look good, Harold.
How have you been feeling?

09:22.200 --> 09:23.804
Much better, actually.

09:24.040 --> 09:26.122
Thanks in part to you.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.049
- Thank you, Tom.
- You're welcome.

09:28.240 --> 09:30.242
So, what is it that brings you by?

09:30.440 --> 09:34.650
It came to my attention that a couple of
your people paid a visit to Roger Hobbs.

09:34.880 --> 09:37.963
Came to your attention. Are you
monitoring our investigations now?

09:38.160 --> 09:40.367
Easy, Harold. It's not like that.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.921
- Hobbs a friend of yours?
- He's a friend of ours.

09:43.120 --> 09:45.202
His companies hold
multiple defense contracts.

09:45.400 --> 09:48.051
- He's one of the good guys.
- Why do I need to know this?

09:48.240 --> 09:49.730
I'm sensing some defensiveness.

09:49.920 --> 09:52.161
You're suggesting
that all of this information...

09:52.400 --> 09:55.563
...should somehow impact
my investigation, which can't be true.

09:55.760 --> 09:58.604
We've known each other too long
for you to cross that line.

09:58.800 --> 10:01.326
I'm not crossing any lines.

10:01.560 --> 10:03.688
I'm just passing along some background.

10:03.880 --> 10:06.042
That said, all things being equal...

10:06.240 --> 10:09.562
...I'd like to see this guy
given the benefit of the doubt.

10:09.760 --> 10:11.444
All things are never equal.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.802
Listen, Harold...

10:16.000 --> 10:18.606
...you should do
what you think is right.

10:19.560 --> 10:22.723
I certainly hope that nothing
I've said would imply otherwise.

10:26.320 --> 10:28.926
We were all heartbroken
when we heard about William.

10:29.120 --> 10:32.522
And mortified when we thought he might've
wandered away under our supervision.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.802
- You saying he was abducted?
- Yes.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.048
You must have
security measures in place.

10:37.280 --> 10:39.044
Would you be able to provide a list...

10:39.280 --> 10:41.681
...of who had facility access
the day he disappeared?

10:41.880 --> 10:44.850
- I'll get that for you right away.
- And where was William last seen?

10:45.080 --> 10:47.447
The south yard.
Diane, one of our best caretakers...

10:47.640 --> 10:51.361
...was taking the patients out for some
air. William was sitting with John Paul.

10:51.560 --> 10:53.722
Diane said she turned away
for a few moments.

10:53.960 --> 10:57.362
- When she looked back, he was gone.
- May I talk to John Paul?

10:57.560 --> 11:01.406
You can try,
but he's not very communicative.

11:06.000 --> 11:08.571
Looks like a good hand you've got there.

11:09.320 --> 11:11.129
Eight's open.

11:13.640 --> 11:16.371
I'm Elizabeth. I'm With the FBI.

11:16.560 --> 11:19.882
I was wondering if I could ask you some
questions about William Eckhoff?

11:20.080 --> 11:23.243
You were with him when he disappeared,
am I right?

11:24.480 --> 11:26.562
The people I work with,
we're looking for him.

11:26.760 --> 11:30.367
Is there anything you can tell us?
Did you see anything?

11:34.040 --> 11:37.681
Was there anyone else there
with you that we could speak to?

11:43.360 --> 11:45.931
Thank you for your time.

11:48.640 --> 11:50.688
- Any luck?
- No. You?

11:50.880 --> 11:52.882
Security log the day
of the disappearance.

11:53.080 --> 11:56.527
- Everyone on-site was authorized to be.
- Mm.

12:02.680 --> 12:06.207
- "Gold Crown Pharmaceuticals."
- Loyd Munroe. He's one of their reps.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.767
He visited one of our physicians
that afternoon.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.008
Does that mean something to you?

12:16.760 --> 12:19.843
Gold Crown Pharmaceuticals?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

12:25.760 --> 12:27.285
Hey, guys. What you got?

12:27.840 --> 12:31.845
A birthday card
and 31 red-velvet cupcakes.

12:32.040 --> 12:33.849
Uh, well, 30. I couldn't resist.

12:34.040 --> 12:36.327
- When are you coming back?
- Aram, the suspect.

12:36.560 --> 12:38.085
Work. Right.

12:38.280 --> 12:42.001
Okay, "Loyd Munroe, 37 years old
of North Beach, Maryland."

12:42.240 --> 12:44.811
No criminal history.
I just called Gold Crown.

12:45.000 --> 12:48.891
They said he didn't report for work today.
I'm running his phone and financials now.

12:49.120 --> 12:50.121
I've got something.

12:50.320 --> 12:52.482
Another victim was a patient
at Landover Hills.

12:52.680 --> 12:55.081
Guess which rep was there
when he disappeared.

12:55.280 --> 12:58.363
Loyd Munroe. That's gotta be our guy.
That can't be a coincidence.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.244
- Let's bring him in.
- Might be a problem.

13:00.440 --> 13:02.120
According to
recent credit-card activity...

13:02.200 --> 13:05.329
...Loyd just bought a bus ticket
out of Buffalo on the silver line.

13:05.520 --> 13:10.128
Get the local P.D. on the line.
Tell them they need to stop that bus.

13:10.320 --> 13:13.130
You know,
not everyone's so anxious to leave.

13:13.320 --> 13:16.210
Put a flag on Tom,
all his known aliases. He hasn't left.

13:16.440 --> 13:17.805
You don't know that for sure.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.570
- Has he reached out to you?
- No.

13:19.760 --> 13:22.764
He's a murderer. Just because
he got off doesn't change that.

13:23.320 --> 13:25.209
I don't even know where he is.

13:25.400 --> 13:29.849
I'll drop you off at Hilltop Lanes.
There's a locker there, B-15.

13:30.040 --> 13:34.011
Tickets are in a go-bag.
Take the first flight you can to London.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.680
- Mr. Pitts will be waiting.
- Reddington just showed up.

13:36.920 --> 13:40.367
- I don't know how.
- It's not on Reddington.

13:40.760 --> 13:42.808
I didn't have a choice, Bud.

13:44.920 --> 13:46.046
I'm sorry.

13:48.480 --> 13:50.084
Where's my gun?

13:53.440 --> 13:54.851
I'm not going to London, am I?

14:01.440 --> 14:03.841
My uncle was a farmer.

14:04.440 --> 14:09.731
He had a beautiful border collie.
Smart, well-trained, loyal as hell...

14:09.920 --> 14:13.083
...but one summer, that dog,
he got into the hen house...

14:13.280 --> 14:15.567
...killed half the chickens.

14:15.760 --> 14:17.364
My uncle...

14:18.040 --> 14:22.090
...he loved that dog,
but he knew he had to be put down.

14:22.280 --> 14:24.681
I can go someplace
far away from here.

14:24.920 --> 14:29.562
You burned Reddington for the girl,
and I looked the other way.

14:29.800 --> 14:31.882
- And then there's Dresden.
- This is me.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.050
You went to the feds for the girl, Jacob.

14:36.080 --> 14:38.686
You're gonna put a bullet in my head?
After Capetown?

14:38.880 --> 14:40.245
Roll down the window.

14:41.640 --> 14:43.563
I'm not just some operative, all right?

14:43.760 --> 14:45.364
You know me.

14:45.560 --> 14:46.641
You raised me.

14:46.840 --> 14:49.127
You knew the rules, kid.

14:49.760 --> 14:52.047
I warned you about the girl...

14:52.920 --> 14:55.526
...and she's cost you your life.

15:08.400 --> 15:10.129
Christof, old pal.

15:10.440 --> 15:12.283
We've been looking for you.

15:18.680 --> 15:19.727
You know what this is?

15:20.280 --> 15:23.011
The ballistics report that proves
the gun you had on you...

15:23.200 --> 15:25.089
...was the one used to murder that cop.

15:25.520 --> 15:27.921
Killing a police officer
is a capital offense.

15:28.120 --> 15:30.282
That makes you eligible
for the death penalty.

15:31.040 --> 15:32.200
I don't know anything.

15:32.280 --> 15:35.250
Right. Which is why we found you
on a bus fleeing the country.

15:35.440 --> 15:36.965
We want the people you work for.

15:37.200 --> 15:39.601
Give them to us,
and we'll talk to the U.S. attorney.

15:39.800 --> 15:41.768
Recommend a life sentence.
You do enough...

15:42.000 --> 15:44.526
...you might even get
the possibility of parole.

15:46.840 --> 15:47.966
Julian Powell.

15:48.160 --> 15:50.845
That's who paid me.
A doctor named Julian Powell.

15:51.040 --> 15:52.883
- To do what?
- He needed test subjects.

15:53.080 --> 15:54.923
Ones that fit
very specific requirements.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.691
- People with frontal-lobe damage.
- I located them...

15:57.880 --> 16:01.009
...because as a drug rep,
I had access to care facilities.

16:01.200 --> 16:04.170
Tell us about Roger Hobbs.
What's his connection to all of this?

16:04.400 --> 16:06.368
- Don't know who that is.
- If you're lying...

16:06.560 --> 16:08.130
I'm not lying. I can help you.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.449
I always deliver and pick up
the test subjects from the same place.

16:11.640 --> 16:12.641
Clinic's secure.

16:12.840 --> 16:16.162
Upon entry, our team encountered
two unknown subs, white males...

16:16.360 --> 16:17.600
...mid 30s.

16:17.800 --> 16:20.246
They appeared to be med techs
of some kind.

16:20.440 --> 16:21.930
They're in custody.

16:22.160 --> 16:25.050
- What about Powell?
- Not a sign of him, but what we did find...

16:25.240 --> 16:26.651
...you gotta see for yourself.

16:30.760 --> 16:32.922
- Dr. Maynard.
- Meet victim number four.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.849
Same profile as the others...

16:35.040 --> 16:37.122
...but at least we know
what we're looking at.

16:37.320 --> 16:38.446
- We do?
- Powell's been experimenting...

16:38.680 --> 16:41.843
...on patients with a very specific
and severe form of brain damage.

16:42.040 --> 16:43.610
Injecting their brains
with a collection of cells.

16:43.800 --> 16:47.885
Combination of fetal stern cells
and some kind of foreign matter.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.366
So he's injecting their brains
with jellyfish cells.

16:51.560 --> 16:53.562
Yes. He's been keeping
meticulous records.

16:53.760 --> 16:55.922
Jellyfish are at the center
of his experiments.

16:56.160 --> 16:58.766
We should get those files to Aram
as quickly as possible.

16:58.960 --> 17:01.486
From his notes,
he's focused on transgenic research...

17:01.680 --> 17:05.526
...which is the transferring of genes from
one species into the genome of another.

17:06.760 --> 17:07.807
Look.

17:09.839 --> 17:12.810
These two rabbits are sisters.
Before their mother gave birth...

17:13.000 --> 17:16.800
...Powell removed the embryos that made
them and injected one with jellyfish DNA.

17:17.000 --> 17:20.209
He then inserted the embryos back into
the mother. See the difference?

17:20.400 --> 17:22.209
They look identical.

17:24.680 --> 17:27.160
Legitimate researchers around
the world are doing this.

17:27.400 --> 17:30.085
They've made glowing cats,
monkeys, cockroaches.

17:30.280 --> 17:34.490
I mean, this is very impressive,
but the new work he's doing...

17:34.680 --> 17:36.205
...that's in here.

17:38.400 --> 17:41.449
Behold, Turritopsis dohrnii.

17:41.640 --> 17:44.246
Known to modern science
as the "immortal jellyfish."

17:44.440 --> 17:47.125
It's the only living creature on Earth
that never dies.

17:47.320 --> 17:49.766
Well, I mean, it's born
and grows old like we do...

17:50.000 --> 17:53.049
...but then, when it encounters
environmental stress or assault...

17:53.240 --> 17:56.449
...it reverses the aging process
until it's just a little polyp again.

17:56.640 --> 17:57.846
How's that even possible?

17:58.040 --> 18:01.283
It has the amazing ability
to change its own cells.

18:01.800 --> 18:04.007
Like a butterfly that turns
into a caterpillar...

18:04.200 --> 18:07.044
...that grows back into a butterfly,
or a chicken that becomes an egg...

18:07.240 --> 18:08.890
...that hatches a new chicken.

18:09.080 --> 18:14.564
So Powell is using these jellyfish
to conduct experiments on human brains.

18:14.760 --> 18:17.411
He must be trying to regenerate
the damaged brain tissue.

18:17.600 --> 18:20.444
He wants our cells to learn
from the Turritopsis dohrnii.

18:20.640 --> 18:24.440
I mean, look. Julian Powell,
clearly insane. If this ever worked...

18:24.640 --> 18:28.690
...it would be a concrete first step
toward human immortality.

18:29.200 --> 18:33.125
- So, what do we know about this guy?
- He joined Sadovo Solutions in 2005.

18:33.320 --> 18:35.243
It was a biotech company
in Chapel Hill.

18:35.440 --> 18:38.171
Worked on the research side.
He was an endocrinologist.

18:38.360 --> 18:39.885
Why say "was" like he died?

18:40.080 --> 18:42.447
Because it's kind of like he did.
The guy's a ghost.

18:42.680 --> 18:45.604
After he left the company in 2007,
he stopped paying taxes.

18:45.800 --> 18:47.962
No residence on file,
no active credit lines.

18:48.160 --> 18:51.004
No medical or driver's license
renewals the last eight years.

18:51.200 --> 18:53.931
- Dropped off the face of the earth.
- Wait a sec. Get this.

18:54.120 --> 18:57.886
Sadovo Solutions, the biotech company
Powell worked for before he vanished...

18:58.080 --> 19:00.845
...guess who owned it.
- Roger Hobbs.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.963
Not enough to secure
an arrest warrant...

19:03.200 --> 19:06.568
...but it's certainly enough
to bring him in for another chat.

19:08.120 --> 19:10.771
Hey, big day. Any plans to celebrate?

19:11.000 --> 19:14.163
Oh, uh, yeah, I'm gonna go
to Wing Yee's with a few friends.

19:14.360 --> 19:15.930
- No big deal.
- Wow.

19:16.120 --> 19:18.407
Restrain yourself, Keen.

19:18.600 --> 19:20.250
Come on. Smile, it's your birthday.

19:20.440 --> 19:22.886
- You got plenty to celebrate.
- Thanks. You're sweet.

19:23.560 --> 19:26.769
You're not listening. My lab was raided.
The FBI took everything.

19:26.960 --> 19:29.645
I am aware, Julian,
which is why you need to come in.

19:29.840 --> 19:32.320
You authorized my research.
You knew what I was doing.

19:32.560 --> 19:35.564
I authorized you to begin
preliminary trials...

19:35.760 --> 19:37.808
...for the purposes
of second-stage research.

19:38.000 --> 19:40.287
I'm near a breakthrough.
You've seen the data.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.608
You've jeopardized
the entire initiative...

19:42.800 --> 19:45.929
...not to mention putting me and
everything I've worked for at risk.

19:46.160 --> 19:48.811
- Julian, you need to come in.
- No.

19:49.040 --> 19:50.485
This is bigger than you, Roger.

19:50.680 --> 19:53.001
This is bigger than any of us.

19:57.640 --> 20:00.644
This has become a serious problem.

20:01.320 --> 20:02.970
It's not easy being God.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.686
You got any idea
how much this guy's cost me?

20:05.880 --> 20:07.405
Not his work, but the security.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.688
People out there would pay a fortune...

20:09.880 --> 20:12.690
...just to know his name
and steal his research away.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.723
- What's it worth?
- Hard to say.

20:15.160 --> 20:19.210
A foot in the door to human immortality
on the open market?

20:19.440 --> 20:21.363
Now I gotta get rid of him.

20:21.560 --> 20:25.246
- I'm not gonna lie to you. It hurts.
- You know my feeling.

20:25.440 --> 20:28.011
Humans as a species
are untrustworthy creatures.

20:28.240 --> 20:30.288
We don't deserve to live forever.

20:30.480 --> 20:32.847
What the hell were you thinking,
Roger...

20:33.080 --> 20:37.369
...even to consider authorizing this
Powell to conduct human trials?

20:37.560 --> 20:40.803
It was necessary for the research
to reach the next level.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.923
I didn't know
he was gonna be so reckless.

20:43.120 --> 20:45.088
You had to know people would die.

20:45.280 --> 20:48.329
How many innocents died
in the search for the smallpox vaccine?

20:48.520 --> 20:50.648
All in the name of
the advancement of science.

20:50.840 --> 20:53.286
This isn't about science, Roger.

20:53.520 --> 20:57.286
This is about you actually believing
that death is beneath you.

20:57.520 --> 20:59.090
No, this is what it takes.

20:59.680 --> 21:01.330
Pasteur,
he wasn't even a physician.

21:01.520 --> 21:04.729
The day that he injected that
small boy with the rabies vaccine...

21:04.920 --> 21:07.526
...he was risking criminal prosecution.

21:07.720 --> 21:12.681
Jonas Salk injected the flu virus into
men in an insane asylum in Michigan.

21:12.880 --> 21:16.726
Decade later, he's being hailed
as the genius who cured polio.

21:16.960 --> 21:18.928
I know of a doctor
who agreed with you.

21:19.120 --> 21:23.125
A relatively young man
also fascinated by genetics.

21:23.320 --> 21:27.245
A man who didn't concern
himself with morality, humanity.

21:27.800 --> 21:29.802
That was Josef Mengele.

21:30.000 --> 21:33.322
I don't need you to agree
with what I've already done, Red.

21:33.560 --> 21:36.769
But I would like to know
if you're willing to help me now.

21:37.400 --> 21:40.961
Sir, there are two agents
from the FBI at the front door.

21:41.160 --> 21:44.721
- They insist on seeing you right away.
- I'll be right down.

21:51.720 --> 21:55.202
The identity of my scientist,
everything you need to know...

21:55.400 --> 21:56.890
...to take care of the problem.

21:57.120 --> 21:59.168
If it were anyone else, I'd decline...

21:59.360 --> 22:01.567
...but for you, Roger...

22:01.760 --> 22:03.205
...I'll see what I can do.

22:08.880 --> 22:11.770
Agent Keen, Ressler, come on in.

22:16.840 --> 22:18.763
You are going to tell me.

22:18.920 --> 22:19.967
You are going to talk.

22:20.160 --> 22:22.208
You know that, right?
Is it Reddington?

22:22.440 --> 22:25.125
You work for him?
Because you are not cops.

22:25.360 --> 22:28.523
If you're gonna do it, do it.
Two bullets. Get it over with.

22:28.720 --> 22:31.166
No, no, no.
That's not how we do things.

22:31.360 --> 22:33.203
Not with boys like you.

22:42.360 --> 22:44.966
- Everything ready?
- Yeah.

22:48.640 --> 22:50.290
Him first.

22:54.320 --> 22:56.891
Have you heard of the blood eagle?

23:00.640 --> 23:03.371
We cut the skin...

23:03.560 --> 23:04.846
...along the spine...

23:06.400 --> 23:09.529
...pull the lungs out through the ribs...

23:11.200 --> 23:13.043
...watch them flutter...

23:13.760 --> 23:15.683
...like blood-stained wings.

23:16.920 --> 23:19.571
It's actually quite beautiful.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.129
That's a cute story.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.207
I'm not gonna talk. Unh!

23:27.400 --> 23:29.243
Okay.

23:29.440 --> 23:30.441
Got something.

23:37.000 --> 23:39.162
"Elizabeth...

23:40.400 --> 23:41.970
...Keen."

23:43.880 --> 23:46.406
You still not gonna talk?

23:55.240 --> 23:58.562
Dr. Levin, you have excellent timing.
I was intending to call you today.

23:58.760 --> 24:01.730
- Not because you're feeling worse?
- Actually, it's the opposite.

24:01.960 --> 24:04.361
For the first time in a while,
I feel like myself again.

24:04.560 --> 24:08.201
This new drug you're testing,
I think we're really on to something.

24:09.480 --> 24:11.801
- Dr. Levin?
- I'm here.

24:12.000 --> 24:16.881
I'm so pleased we're having success,
Harold, but to be honest...

24:17.080 --> 24:20.129
...it makes this call
all the more difficult.

24:20.320 --> 24:22.721
The study is evolving,
as these things do.

24:22.920 --> 24:28.006
They're always looking at the results
and the funding and making adjustments.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.645
What kind of adjustments?

24:29.840 --> 24:33.003
I heard today that they're lowering
the age parameters...

24:33.240 --> 24:35.402
...as we move
into this next round of treatment.

24:35.600 --> 24:40.401
No final decisions have been made,
but I need to let you know.

24:41.320 --> 24:44.051
It's possible we won't
be able to continue with the trial.

24:44.840 --> 24:46.808
So they're removing me
from the program?

24:47.040 --> 24:49.441
No. We're still waiting on a decision...

24:49.640 --> 24:54.521
...and I promise to do what I can
to avoid any change.

24:55.880 --> 24:57.325
I really am sorry, Harold.

24:57.840 --> 25:01.367
You know how I feel
about you and Charlene.

25:03.600 --> 25:06.729
- Keep your mouth shut.
- Cut him open.

25:06.920 --> 25:10.447
- Unh. Sarah Hastings.
- You son of a bitch.

25:10.640 --> 25:13.041
- And what about her?
- Don't say a word.

25:13.280 --> 25:15.806
I'm not gonna say anything
until you guarantee me...

25:16.000 --> 25:18.446
...that you don't touch Elizabeth Keen.

25:18.640 --> 25:22.565
What I can guarantee
about Elizabeth Keen...

25:22.760 --> 25:25.604
...is I'm gonna find her,
and I'm gonna kill her.

25:25.800 --> 25:27.643
She's FBI.

25:28.320 --> 25:31.449
- You a cop?
- No. I was married to one.

25:31.640 --> 25:32.687
But not now.

25:33.840 --> 25:36.923
- Why do you care?
- Jacob, no.

25:37.120 --> 25:39.691
Someone in your group
murdered Sarah Hastings.

25:39.880 --> 25:43.009
- Oh, God.
- I was hired to find out who.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.601
Powerful people are looking for you,
Elias.

25:45.800 --> 25:48.280
If you wanna know who,
then you promise me you never...

25:48.520 --> 25:50.522
...ever touch Elizabeth Keen.

25:51.640 --> 25:54.610
Elias. If she's FBI...

25:55.240 --> 25:58.289
You sell me out for that bitch,
and I swear I'll hunt you down.

25:58.480 --> 26:01.529
...we touch her... for all we know him...

26:02.240 --> 26:06.245
...we're gonna have the full force
of the FBI breathing down our neck.

26:08.440 --> 26:10.761
We don't need that.

26:12.600 --> 26:16.400
You need to let me go.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.729
I can help you.

26:43.720 --> 26:45.609
Don't say another word.

26:45.800 --> 26:48.883
You know that girl
you said cost me my life?

26:51.120 --> 26:52.610
She just saved it.

26:54.000 --> 26:57.209
We don't see a lot of billionaires
suspected of murder.

26:57.400 --> 27:00.882
You'd be wise to remember that my
client hasn't been charged with anything.

27:01.080 --> 27:03.447
Earlier today, we raided
a clinic used to conduct...

27:03.680 --> 27:06.968
...experimental transgenic research
on human test subjects.

27:07.160 --> 27:10.562
That research was being
conducted by a Dr. Julian Powell.

27:10.760 --> 27:13.127
You failed to mention
your connection with him...

27:13.360 --> 27:15.522
...the last time we spoke.
- What connection?

27:15.720 --> 27:19.566
He worked for you at a biotech
company called Sadovo Solutions.

27:19.760 --> 27:22.843
And now he surfaces,
abducting disabled patients...

27:23.040 --> 27:25.122
...doing illegal experiments,
killing people.

27:25.320 --> 27:29.291
Have you any idea how many people
I've employed over the last 20 years?

27:29.480 --> 27:31.608
This is one hell of a coincidence,
Mr. Hobbs.

27:31.800 --> 27:34.371
We come around asking
about human experiments...

27:34.560 --> 27:37.450
...and when we find
the man responsible...

27:37.640 --> 27:39.449
...he has a direct connection to you.

27:39.640 --> 27:42.166
He may have been an employee
of mine many years ago...

27:42.360 --> 27:46.206
...but I'm sorry,
I have absolutely no recollection of him.

27:46.400 --> 27:49.244
And I'm gonna guess you've got
nothing to suggest otherwise.

27:49.480 --> 27:52.324
We're looking into every phone call,
every correspondence...

27:52.560 --> 27:55.928
...every shred of data that we can pull
on Julian Powell and that clinic.

27:56.120 --> 27:57.849
If you're funding him...

27:58.040 --> 28:00.088
...we will prove it.

28:00.960 --> 28:02.007
What do you have?

28:02.240 --> 28:03.844
We've got straight denial.

28:04.040 --> 28:06.646
- He's pretty much calling our bluff.
- He say anything...

28:06.840 --> 28:09.810
...to connect him to Powell?
- Nothing of value, but it's early.

28:10.040 --> 28:12.646
- We'll keep at him.
- It's not enough to arrest him.

28:12.840 --> 28:14.360
He's lying to us about Powell.

28:14.520 --> 28:17.126
We can make a circumstantial
argument that he's involved.

28:17.320 --> 28:20.051
If he is directly connected to Powell,
and we let him go...

28:20.240 --> 28:22.242
...he's gonna destroy the evidence.

28:22.440 --> 28:24.329
- We should hold him.
- See that lawyer?

28:24.520 --> 28:26.320
He can afford that suit
and the beach house...

28:26.400 --> 28:28.687
...because he'll never let that happen.
- Let him file.

28:28.880 --> 28:31.850
By the time he gets heard,
we'll probably have what we need.

28:34.000 --> 28:35.001
What's going on, boss?

28:35.720 --> 28:37.290
I'm just saying...

28:37.520 --> 28:39.761
...not all suspects are created equal.

28:39.960 --> 28:42.247
Somebody told me
that you were gonna say that...

28:42.440 --> 28:44.841
...I'd have bet every damn dime
that they were wrong.

28:45.040 --> 28:47.646
He's got friends in high places.
Since when do you care?

28:47.840 --> 28:50.207
Hey, if we don't have enough,
go get enough.

28:50.400 --> 28:53.370
But in the meantime, kick him loose.

28:57.760 --> 29:00.525
Maybe we can't connect Hobbs
directly with the victims...

29:00.720 --> 29:03.963
...but I have a feeling Dr. Powell can.
All we have to do is find him.

29:04.160 --> 29:06.242
I can help.
Been going over files recovered...

29:06.440 --> 29:08.761
...from Powell's facility,
and check this out:

29:09.880 --> 29:12.281
- These are the test subjects?
- Yes and no.

29:12.520 --> 29:16.605
All of them are deceased except for one.
The woman on the bottom right.

29:16.800 --> 29:18.928
Leann McGrath, 34 years old...

29:19.120 --> 29:22.602
...currently a resident of Twin Pines
Assisted Living Center in Springdale.

29:22.800 --> 29:26.486
Powell collected all her medical files.
Been tracking her condition for years.

29:26.680 --> 29:28.967
The same frontal-lobe condition
as the others.

29:29.200 --> 29:32.090
I have a feeling we just found
Dr. Powell's next test subject.

29:52.560 --> 29:54.244
Sweetheart...

29:54.480 --> 29:55.845
...I'm so sorry...

29:57.480 --> 29:59.687
...but I failed you.

30:05.080 --> 30:06.525
We need to go away from here.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.242
Don't worry.
I haven't forgot your things.

30:21.880 --> 30:24.690
Julian? I wasn't expecting you today.

30:24.920 --> 30:27.207
What's going on?
Are you taking her somewhere?

30:27.400 --> 30:29.641
Todd, I don't have time to explain...

30:29.840 --> 30:32.320
...but I need you to understand that...

30:32.680 --> 30:34.205
...this isn't personal.

30:38.520 --> 30:41.364
We need you to escort us to
Leann McGrath's room immediately.

30:41.560 --> 30:43.483
Yes, of course, agent.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.004
What happened? You okay?

30:46.240 --> 30:49.084
He took Miss McGrath
toward client pickup.

30:54.880 --> 30:56.086
Dr. Powell.

30:57.200 --> 30:58.884
Let's go for a ride.

31:11.920 --> 31:13.922
Reddington.

31:20.560 --> 31:22.847
I'm sorry, but I don't know
who the hell you are.

31:23.040 --> 31:25.042
My name is Raymond Reddington.

31:25.240 --> 31:29.723
I'm the man who was sent
by Roger Hobbs to get rid of you.

31:30.240 --> 31:33.642
Relax, doctor.
I have no intention of killing you.

31:33.840 --> 31:37.526
- You are a potential solution to a problem.
- How so?

31:37.720 --> 31:42.282
A young woman I know
and care for had a distant memory...

31:42.480 --> 31:48.010
...quite literally taken away from her
when she was a little girl.

31:48.200 --> 31:49.486
Erased.

31:49.720 --> 31:52.690
So, you wanna apply my work
to the field of memory extraction.

31:52.880 --> 31:55.611
Not your work, doctor. Your research.

31:55.800 --> 31:59.850
If you've been able to prove
that brain cells can regenerate...

32:00.040 --> 32:04.409
...with time, would your breakthrough
relate in any way...

32:04.600 --> 32:07.331
...to the restoration
of this young woman's memory?

32:11.040 --> 32:13.088
No. My work will not help
the woman remember.

32:14.080 --> 32:17.641
In theory, transgenics can help
rebuild damaged memory synapses...

32:17.840 --> 32:19.763
...but there's a more...

32:20.640 --> 32:23.211
There's a more fundamental problem.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.129
And that is?

32:27.400 --> 32:28.845
Let me show you.

32:29.040 --> 32:30.280
You know Julian Powell?

32:30.480 --> 32:33.086
Of course. She's his fiancée.
She was in a car accident.

32:33.280 --> 32:36.841
She suffered catastrophic damage
to the frontal lobe of her brain.

32:37.520 --> 32:39.488
There's an article here
about the accident.

32:39.720 --> 32:42.121
I think it might have more of the story.

32:42.520 --> 32:44.727
"The car Miss McGrath was riding in...

32:44.920 --> 32:47.360
...jumped a center divide
and hit an oncoming tractor trailer.

32:47.440 --> 32:48.601
Officers on-scene said...

32:48.800 --> 32:52.521
...Miss McGrath's car was being
driven by her fiancé, Julian Powell."

32:58.400 --> 33:00.448
This is where she lived.

33:02.720 --> 33:05.326
It's all I have left of who she was.

33:05.960 --> 33:07.485
I proposed in this room.

33:08.080 --> 33:11.482
Wasn't supposed to happen like that.
I had a more romantic plan...

33:11.640 --> 33:14.769
...but once I had the ring,
I couldn't help it.

33:16.080 --> 33:17.923
Six weeks later, she was gone.

33:18.800 --> 33:21.280
We were in the hospital,
St. Michael's...

33:21.520 --> 33:24.364
...and a good friend of mine
and his wife were having a baby.

33:24.600 --> 33:28.446
And Leann and I were in
the maternity ward until 4 a.m.

33:28.640 --> 33:31.211
It was one of the happiest nights
of my life.

33:35.360 --> 33:37.647
And then,
in the car on the way home...

33:38.320 --> 33:40.891
...we were both so tired.

33:45.200 --> 33:48.329
- Yeah.
- You fell asleep at the wheel.

33:49.760 --> 33:53.367
So this is why he's been experimenting
on patients with frontal-lobe damage.

33:53.560 --> 33:57.724
He's not looking for immortality. He's
trying to bring back the woman he loves.

33:57.920 --> 34:01.720
I suppose Roger Hobbs
doesn't care about your...

34:02.200 --> 34:04.043
...motives or practices...

34:04.240 --> 34:06.288
...as long as he profits
from your findings.

34:06.520 --> 34:08.204
I needed money to fund my research.

34:08.440 --> 34:10.806
It was the only way
I could fix what I've done.

34:11.000 --> 34:13.161
And the only way
that I could get Leann back.

34:13.400 --> 34:14.889
What did you say to him, doctor?

34:15.080 --> 34:18.641
Told him that my work
would help him live forever.

34:19.480 --> 34:22.210
And he wrote a check that afternoon.

34:24.440 --> 34:26.761
This is where
I do most of my real work.

34:27.000 --> 34:32.404
Thousands of hours spent sitting here,
just searching, planning, believing.

34:32.600 --> 34:33.965
And...

34:34.159 --> 34:35.969
...for what? Look. Look at this.

34:36.159 --> 34:37.491
Look at...

34:38.199 --> 34:40.407
Useless.

34:40.639 --> 34:45.123
- You never found anything.
- I lied, falsified the data.

34:45.840 --> 34:47.603
I had to. Hobbs would've cut me off.

34:48.199 --> 34:49.565
But none of this works.

34:49.760 --> 34:52.650
My research is a failure.

34:53.440 --> 34:55.522
I am a failure.

34:57.080 --> 34:58.570
I can't save her.

34:58.760 --> 35:01.923
You killed a lot of innocent people,
Dr. Powell.

35:02.160 --> 35:04.527
I wanted to help them.

35:04.720 --> 35:07.041
What life did they have?

35:14.120 --> 35:16.691
What kind of life can she have now?

35:37.840 --> 35:41.481
Once again, police have identified
the man who died earlier today.

35:41.680 --> 35:45.366
We can now confirm his name
is Dr. Julian Powell.

35:45.560 --> 35:48.450
So far, we've been unable to locate...

35:51.400 --> 35:53.402
Nicely done.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.890
Every station's calling it a suicide.

35:58.320 --> 35:59.606
It's done.

36:00.400 --> 36:03.847
- And the FBI?
- Nothing leads back to you.

36:06.200 --> 36:08.282
Why so dour, Roger?

36:08.520 --> 36:11.000
I lost a lot of money on this, Red.

36:11.400 --> 36:16.042
- Tens of millions.
- This has nothing to do with the money.

36:16.240 --> 36:17.969
You wanted it to work.

36:18.800 --> 36:20.086
For all you've achieved...

36:20.320 --> 36:23.130
...you actually thought
this might be your legacy.

36:23.720 --> 36:27.805
If it wasn't for you,
my legacy would be life without parole.

36:28.000 --> 36:32.642
Well, maybe you didn't save
mankind from an untimely death...

36:33.560 --> 36:37.724
...but someday, you may be able
to spare me from one.

36:46.720 --> 36:49.007
Care to tell me
what the hell happened today?

36:49.200 --> 36:51.771
- I suppose I should.
- You stole Powell from under us...

36:51.960 --> 36:55.282
...and then an hour later, he ends up
dead? Did you kill that man?

36:55.520 --> 36:57.648
I'm happy to discuss the day's events...

36:57.840 --> 37:00.923
...but not if you insist on doing so
at this volume.

37:01.120 --> 37:03.441
You gave us this case
because you wanted Powell...

37:03.640 --> 37:06.530
...and then you used us to flush him out.
- Yes.

37:06.720 --> 37:07.960
"Yes."

37:08.880 --> 37:12.043
- You wanted the science.
- The science didn't work.

37:12.240 --> 37:14.004
Powell was falsifying his results.

37:14.200 --> 37:18.489
He was never interested in immortality,
but you know that.

37:18.680 --> 37:24.050
- He wanted to get his fiancée back.
- He knew it was over, so he ended it.

37:24.240 --> 37:27.722
- That's the truth.
- That's half the truth.

37:27.920 --> 37:30.161
I don't take anything you say
at face value.

37:32.120 --> 37:33.884
Fair enough.

37:34.160 --> 37:37.209
My interest in Powell's research
was only half the picture.

37:37.440 --> 37:40.444
This was always about Roger Hobbs.

37:40.640 --> 37:44.087
I used the FBI
to create a problem for Roger.

37:44.320 --> 37:47.005
I needed the man to be in my debt,
and now he is.

37:47.240 --> 37:49.163
Roger Hobbs is a murderer.

37:49.360 --> 37:51.442
He may not have conducted
those experiments...

37:51.640 --> 37:54.041
...but according to the law,
he is just as guilty...

37:54.240 --> 37:56.846
...and now without Powell,
we can't prove it.

37:57.080 --> 38:01.051
Don't be so quick
to make an enemy of Roger Hobbs.

38:01.240 --> 38:04.801
You don't see it yet, Lizzy,
but a dark cloud is approaching...

38:05.000 --> 38:06.889
...and when it arrives...

38:07.080 --> 38:09.367
...Roger Hobbs
will be a very good friend...

38:09.560 --> 38:12.882
...at exactly the moment
he needs to be.

38:15.480 --> 38:18.689
- Harold, sorry to pull you away.
- Looking sharp.

38:18.840 --> 38:21.571
Ha. I'm on my way to some fundraiser.

38:21.760 --> 38:24.525
Another five dollar piece of chicken
for 50,000 a plate.

38:24.720 --> 38:27.849
I have a feeling you'll be seeing
a lot more of those in the future.

38:28.200 --> 38:31.329
Heard things worked out
for Roger Hobbs. I'm glad to hear it.

38:31.520 --> 38:35.206
Hey, I just came by to clear the air
about our conversation earlier.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.687
I hope you didn't misconstrue my intent.

38:37.880 --> 38:38.927
- Not a problem.
- Good.

38:39.120 --> 38:41.122
I wouldn't want anything
to come between us.

38:41.320 --> 38:45.291
Let me ask you a question.
I got a call earlier from Dr. Levin.

38:45.480 --> 38:48.882
He said I might get cut from the trial.
You know anything about that?

38:49.080 --> 38:51.242
How would I know anything about that?

38:51.880 --> 38:53.848
But I wouldn't sweat it. I'll make a call.

38:55.200 --> 38:57.202
That's what friends do.

39:03.400 --> 39:05.562
- Hey.
- Well, hey. What are you still doing here?

39:05.760 --> 39:08.889
I could ask you the same thing.
What happened to dinner?

39:09.080 --> 39:11.208
I just didn't feel like going out.

39:13.440 --> 39:15.488
What's going on, Keen?

39:17.000 --> 39:20.083
You said earlier
that I had so much to celebrate.

39:21.320 --> 39:23.482
You know that isn't true.

39:23.920 --> 39:27.686
I mean, I thought by the time I was in
my 30s, I'd have something to show for it.

39:28.280 --> 39:32.729
I would at least be a prestigious profiler.
I mean, I was the top in my class.

39:32.920 --> 39:35.491
I'd have a loving relationship
with someone...

39:35.720 --> 39:38.007
...maybe we would be raising
a family together.

39:38.960 --> 39:40.166
At least you've got a dog.

39:40.360 --> 39:41.964
That's one up on me.

39:42.760 --> 39:44.762
I don't know who I am.

39:46.400 --> 39:48.482
I don't know if this is my birthday.

39:48.680 --> 39:50.489
I don't even know my own name.

39:50.680 --> 39:51.727
No, I know who I am.

39:51.920 --> 39:55.288
I am the puppet
of some high-functioning sociopath.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.369
I don't even know what I'm doing here.

39:57.560 --> 40:02.009
What you're doing here
is celebrating your birthday with me.

40:03.920 --> 40:06.321
- What did you...?
- See, I called the restaurant.

40:06.520 --> 40:09.046
Thought I'd send you
and your friends a bottle of wine.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.083
There wasn't a reservation, so...

40:11.280 --> 40:13.931
...I figured since you weren't
going to Wing Yee...

40:14.120 --> 40:16.327
...I was bringing Wing Yee to you.

40:20.960 --> 40:26.683

40:30.400 --> 40:32.607
Oh, look at you.

40:33.680 --> 40:36.160

40:39.200 --> 40:40.611

41:29.080 --> 41:32.243
I want Jacob Phelps found.

42:09.200 --> 42:11.123
- Shh.
- What are you doing?

42:13.880 --> 42:16.042
I didn't know where else to go.
