04:33.398 --> 04:34.983
Bleh!

07:40.710 --> 07:45.464
Now, I hope the both of you realize
that being a lifeguard is serious business.

07:45.464 --> 07:47.800
The requirements are very demanding.

07:47.800 --> 07:49.760
So keep that in mind, Droopy.

07:49.760 --> 07:52.305
Oh, and you too, Tom.

07:54.348 --> 07:59.312
Always remember,
a lifeguard must be alert.

08:00.271 --> 08:01.772
What?

08:01.772 --> 08:03.691
Where did everybody go?

08:05.234 --> 08:08.487
A lifeguard must be swift.

08:15.411 --> 08:16.662
Oh, dear.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.416
And a lifeguard must be strong.

08:25.504 --> 08:28.257
I'm never going to get this job.

08:44.690 --> 08:45.858
Okay, boys.

08:45.858 --> 08:50.363
Your first test
will be diving from this high board.

08:50.363 --> 08:54.408
Now, you'll be judged on style,
form and grace.

08:54.408 --> 08:57.954
My assistant, Miss Shapely,
will keep score.

08:57.954 --> 08:59.455
She's very good at figures.

09:09.882 --> 09:12.885
I shall go first.

09:27.024 --> 09:29.068
Oh, dear.

09:40.454 --> 09:41.998
Oh, my.

10:25.708 --> 10:29.503
Sports lovers, I'm ready.

10:49.565 --> 10:50.733
Ta-da.

10:57.406 --> 10:59.658
Slight advantage, Droopy.

11:00.868 --> 11:05.790
Your next test will be to swim
across this debris-filled pool...

11:05.790 --> 11:08.834
...over to Miss Shapely on the other side.

11:08.834 --> 11:10.252
Good luck.

11:10.252 --> 11:15.674
I shall do my best to avoid
each and every obstacle.

11:15.674 --> 11:17.676
Who turned out the lights?

11:17.676 --> 11:21.931
On your mark, get set, go.

12:29.790 --> 12:31.709
Glug, glug, glug.

12:34.545 --> 12:35.671
Ready, Droopy?

12:36.797 --> 12:38.757
- Ready.
- On your mark.

12:39.633 --> 12:41.177
Get set.

12:41.177 --> 12:42.845
Go.

13:10.372 --> 13:13.167
Oh, I just can't make up my mind.

13:13.167 --> 13:15.419
They're both excellent candidates.

13:15.419 --> 13:20.257
So I want you to fake a "real emergency"
so we can see how they respond.

13:20.716 --> 13:21.842
Sounds smart.

13:22.676 --> 13:24.762
Help! Help!

13:24.762 --> 13:26.931
Uh, save me.

13:31.227 --> 13:32.311
Help.

13:52.957 --> 13:55.209
Whatever. I'm out of here.

14:04.802 --> 14:06.136
Stomach cramps.

14:06.136 --> 14:10.057
Somebody didn't wait 20 minutes
after eating before going in the water.

14:13.894 --> 14:15.896
Hang on, Tom.

14:22.236 --> 14:26.532
Everyone stand back.
I know just what to do.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.577
One, two, three.

14:34.123 --> 14:37.001
You know,
I almost hope he doesn't wake up.

14:39.920 --> 14:41.505
Bleh!

14:42.923 --> 14:44.008
Yuck.

14:44.008 --> 14:46.802
That was some rescue, Droopy.

14:46.802 --> 14:48.762
You get the job.

14:53.350 --> 14:57.438
Remember, a clean pool is a safe pool.

15:00.274 --> 15:01.734
Keep scrubbing, Tom.

15:19.543 --> 15:24.757
Oh, Thomas, I so enjoy
the peaceful solitude of a camping trip.

15:24.757 --> 15:27.718
MAN [ON RADIO]: <i>We interrupt
this broadcast for a special report.</i>

15:27.718 --> 15:31.805
<i>Bigfoot has been sighted in the vicinity
of the Ootagootasolo Campground.</i>

15:38.187 --> 15:41.231
Bigfoot? Ha! What nonsense.

15:41.231 --> 15:42.816
I don't believe in such things.

16:39.373 --> 16:40.749
MAN [ON RADIO]:
<i>Attention, campers.</i>

16:40.749 --> 16:44.336
<i>The Zoological Society
is offering a $1-million reward...</i>

16:44.336 --> 16:46.964
<i>...for conclusive proof
of Bigfoot's existence.</i>

16:58.600 --> 17:00.686
I'm down here.

17:03.772 --> 17:07.484
Yeah, I know, there's not much inventory
in the height department.

17:07.484 --> 17:09.528
But the feet are gigantic.

17:10.320 --> 17:12.698
The name's Sheldon. Nice to meet you.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.284
I don't introduce myself
to many campers.

17:15.784 --> 17:19.830
In fact, I hardly ever come down
from the deep woods.

17:19.830 --> 17:21.790
But I am starving.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.712
No worries. I won't eat you.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.673
I'm strictly vegan. Grew the fur myself.

17:31.091 --> 17:33.093
Yikes! Who's that?

17:36.722 --> 17:39.349
I'll be captured and put in a zoo.

17:41.059 --> 17:43.061
We gotta hide.

17:55.532 --> 17:57.534
Oh, no. He's picked up my scent.

17:57.534 --> 17:58.869
This guy is good.

18:05.709 --> 18:06.668
Bleh!

18:07.044 --> 18:09.755
Okay, good, but not gifted.

18:09.755 --> 18:11.173
We should still do something.

18:51.588 --> 18:52.631
Quiet!

18:53.674 --> 18:55.634
What's with all that racket?

18:55.634 --> 18:57.636
I want quiet!

18:58.178 --> 19:00.222
Don't you know what quiet is?

19:00.222 --> 19:03.058
What are you, some kind of ignoramus?

19:04.476 --> 19:07.145
Now, get out!

19:07.145 --> 19:11.775
I hate noise! I can't stand noise!

19:12.359 --> 19:16.488
Bears are notoriously cranky
during hibernation.

19:32.212 --> 19:34.965
He can hear my big feet. Help.

19:35.674 --> 19:36.800
Help.

20:24.514 --> 20:25.432
Ouch.

20:34.274 --> 20:39.363
Are you guys starving?
Because I am absolutely famished...

20:41.156 --> 20:42.449
Berries.

20:49.581 --> 20:50.832
Oops.

20:52.918 --> 20:56.463
Too high. I'm down here.

21:22.239 --> 21:24.574
Well, he won't be bothering me anymore.

21:24.574 --> 21:27.035
And I got a bowl full of yummy berries.

21:27.035 --> 21:29.204
Thanks, little friends.
Come back and visit.

21:31.373 --> 21:34.751
Thomas, is--? Is that you?

21:34.751 --> 21:37.045
I thought I heard a noise.

21:40.298 --> 21:45.053
Oh, it's Bigfoot. Save me!

21:48.223 --> 21:51.685
I wonder whatever happened to Tom.

21:51.685 --> 21:52.894
No matter.

21:52.894 --> 21:57.315
I can buy a whole house full of cats
with $1 million.
