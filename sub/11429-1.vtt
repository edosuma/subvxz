00:58.020 --> 00:59.879
Will.

01:04.092 --> 01:06.863
Will. Hey. I asked if you were okay.

01:06.963 --> 01:08.788
Sorry.

01:12.067 --> 01:15.171
You know, we don't have to do this.
We can just go home.

01:15.271 --> 01:17.354
I'll be fine.

01:18.506 --> 01:20.910
God, this thing is so...

01:21.010 --> 01:22.812
thick...

01:23.012 --> 01:24.862
Official.

01:26.248 --> 01:27.884
Maybe they're overcompensating.

01:28.184 --> 01:31.921
It's kind of hard to call everybody up
out of the blue after two years.

01:32.021 --> 01:35.592
- Nobody's seen her?
- I ran into her and David at a supermarket,

01:35.692 --> 01:38.094
and a little bit after that,
I heard they disappeared.

01:38.194 --> 01:40.669
And they met in the grief group?

01:40.969 --> 01:43.104
While we were still married.

01:43.204 --> 01:45.602
Yeah, I guess you could have
put odds on our divorce.

01:45.702 --> 01:48.104
- No, people don't think like that.
- Yes, they do.

01:48.204 --> 01:51.055
- No, they don't.
- Yes, they...

01:53.408 --> 01:55.426
Oh, my God.

01:55.679 --> 01:58.381
- Jesus.
- What was that?

01:58.481 --> 02:00.697
A coyote, I think.

02:04.953 --> 02:06.904
Just stay here.

02:13.263 --> 02:15.212
Oh, man.

02:44.260 --> 02:46.543
You should go back in the car.

03:06.915 --> 03:09.148
Okay, okay.

03:13.589 --> 03:15.739
Oh, my God.

03:54.363 --> 03:56.246
Jesus.

05:44.172 --> 05:46.542
This was your house?

05:46.642 --> 05:49.193
A lot of money in Eden's family.

05:49.745 --> 05:51.762
Wasn't ever mine.

06:12.567 --> 06:14.718
<i>Come on, Ty.</i>

06:16.071 --> 06:18.322
<i>Dinner's ready.</i>

06:29.351 --> 06:31.087
Hey, you're here.

06:31.387 --> 06:34.891
Fucking A. I win, see? Hi!

06:34.991 --> 06:38.928
- Was there a betting pool?
- For entertainment purposes only.

06:39.028 --> 06:40.647
- Hey.
- Hey, buddy.

06:40.747 --> 06:43.097
- I am Gina. We met at their...
- Yes.

06:43.197 --> 06:45.006
- Nice to see you.
- Good to see you.

06:45.106 --> 06:49.672
Kira, you look so fucking hot right now.
Will you bear a child for us, right now?

06:49.772 --> 06:51.570
- We're not kidding.
- And, you...

06:51.670 --> 06:55.511
I see you've almost shed that dirty
dishrag look that's so concerning.

06:55.611 --> 06:58.815
- What? I have a dirty dishrag look?
- Less so now.

06:58.915 --> 07:01.616
- It's just...
- What? Come on.

07:02.985 --> 07:05.103
How are you?

07:06.688 --> 07:08.258
- Is this Kira?
- That's me.

07:08.358 --> 07:10.360
- Hi. I'm Claire.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

07:10.460 --> 07:12.115
- Nice to meet you, too.
- Hey, Will.

07:12.215 --> 07:15.598
I'm Ben. Remember me? We drove
a thriving business into the ground together.

07:15.698 --> 07:16.683
Never thrived.

07:16.783 --> 07:19.619
It was thriving like a motherfucker
for three months, and you know it.

07:20.269 --> 07:22.572
Hey, wait. Where's Choi?

07:22.672 --> 07:25.808
Late as usual, and I can't get
any reception up here either.

07:25.908 --> 07:29.359
- Is Eden and...
- I'm here.

07:40.622 --> 07:42.931
Let me look at you, Will.

07:45.543 --> 07:48.164
- I missed you.
- Me too.

07:49.064 --> 07:51.100
House doesn't look
very different, does it?

07:51.200 --> 07:53.569
No, not... not really.

07:53.669 --> 07:56.945
Well, we're glad you're here.

08:01.443 --> 08:03.480
You're a mess.

08:04.380 --> 08:06.548
And you must be Kira.

08:06.648 --> 08:10.259
Hi. Thank you for having me.

08:12.987 --> 08:15.358
Will, you remember David.

08:15.458 --> 08:18.033
Of course. Sure.

08:20.529 --> 08:24.606
Will, come here. Hey.

08:25.834 --> 08:29.188
I'm so glad you're here.
I'm really glad, man.

08:29.288 --> 08:31.324
Hey, how are you?

08:31.424 --> 08:34.961
Oh, I'm brilliant. I mean,
we've got a lot to talk about,

08:35.061 --> 08:37.263
so much to celebrate tonight.

08:37.363 --> 08:39.506
- Kira.
- Yes.

08:41.833 --> 08:43.642
Okay.

08:44.236 --> 08:46.111
Beautiful.

08:46.304 --> 08:48.808
- What can I get you to drink?
- No, I'm good.

08:48.908 --> 08:51.911
I'd go with the wine.
It's an '85 Rothschild.

08:52.011 --> 08:55.348
- Are you shitting me?
- Okay, what does that mean?

08:55.448 --> 09:01.059
- Oh, Will, you're adorable.
- It's, like, $8 million a bottle, cro-mag.

09:01.453 --> 09:04.076
Well, this night is special.

09:04.176 --> 09:08.628
We shouldn't save these things.
We shouldn't put off enjoying...

09:09.028 --> 09:11.023
what we have.

09:11.123 --> 09:13.032
- You sure?
- I'm good.

09:13.132 --> 09:14.767
Yes. Thank you.

09:14.867 --> 09:17.270
- Well, since everybody's here...
- Except Choi.

09:17.370 --> 09:20.073
- Oh, fucking Choi, man.
- All right.

09:20.173 --> 09:23.376
Except Choi, but, you know, I guess
we'll just have to start without him.

09:25.824 --> 09:31.551
First of all, welcome to our
little reunion of sorts.

09:31.651 --> 09:34.621
You guys are all very special to Eden,

09:34.721 --> 09:37.023
which means you're very special to me,

09:37.123 --> 09:40.626
and we really missed you, and we love you.

09:41.076 --> 09:44.246
You know, each and every one
of us is on a journey,

09:44.346 --> 09:46.616
and we feel that it's important...

09:56.608 --> 09:58.728
We want to open up the house again,

09:58.828 --> 10:02.915
give it and us a new start, so...

10:03.015 --> 10:06.269
Let's raise this ridiculously
expensive glass of wine

10:06.369 --> 10:10.039
- to new beginnings.
- Yeah.

10:10.139 --> 10:11.574
- To new beginnings.
- Cheers.

10:11.674 --> 10:13.109
<i>Salud.</i>

10:13.209 --> 10:15.785
Hey! Save a glass for me.

10:18.880 --> 10:23.058
This is Sadie. Sadie, meet my friends.

10:23.685 --> 10:26.561
- Hey.
- Hi.

10:29.357 --> 10:31.194
So...

10:31.294 --> 10:33.904
How do you guys know each other?

10:36.064 --> 10:38.467
Just friends in common, I guess.

10:38.567 --> 10:40.636
We met in Mexico.

10:40.736 --> 10:44.040
Sadie's staying here with us
and helping us out.

10:44.140 --> 10:48.850
Yeah. It's fun. We have fun.

10:49.879 --> 10:52.757
Hope you don't mind me crashing
the party. It's awesome.

10:56.184 --> 10:58.727
They've told me so much about you.

11:04.859 --> 11:07.697
- We hit a coyote on the way up here.
- What?

11:07.797 --> 11:11.934
It just came out of nowhere.
I mean, there was nothing we could do.

11:12.434 --> 11:15.805
It was in horrible shape.
He had to kill it.

11:15.905 --> 11:19.976
What? How did you not
tell us this, like, immediately?

11:20.076 --> 11:24.740
You killed it with, like, what?

11:24.980 --> 11:28.317
- Tire iron.
- Oh, God. What?

11:28.417 --> 11:31.287
I don't know how you did it, man.
That's pretty butch.

11:31.387 --> 11:34.699
No, it was a good thing. That was mercy.

11:37.258 --> 11:39.746
Would you mind
if I looked around for a little bit?

11:39.846 --> 11:41.936
Of course not.

11:42.763 --> 11:44.639
Thank you.

11:45.733 --> 11:47.809
See you in a bit.

11:49.270 --> 11:52.909
Can't believe it.
A tire iron requires a lot of...

12:16.530 --> 12:18.501
No, you don't. No, you don't.

12:18.601 --> 12:21.938
No, you don't. No. No. No!

12:22.038 --> 12:23.840
Will.

12:24.140 --> 12:26.142
Jesus.

12:26.242 --> 12:28.950
Sorry. You scared me.

12:29.978 --> 12:32.120
No harm done.

12:32.847 --> 12:36.986
You're so handsome tonight.
You're shining.

12:37.086 --> 12:39.022
And, Kira,

12:39.122 --> 12:41.796
you're both really beautiful.

12:42.323 --> 12:44.301
Thank you.

12:49.865 --> 12:53.274
Could you help me
get those glasses, please?

12:57.772 --> 13:00.209
Bars on windows are new.

13:00.309 --> 13:03.913
Well, I was here alone for a while.

13:04.213 --> 13:07.751
It's security, safer.

13:10.885 --> 13:12.894
It's nice.

13:13.588 --> 13:16.759
Thank you. We got them in Mexico.

13:16.859 --> 13:19.679
Is that where you've been
for the last two years?

13:19.779 --> 13:21.953
Some of the time.

13:24.532 --> 13:27.303
Did you worry about me?
Did you think about me?

13:28.003 --> 13:29.844
Yeah.

13:30.438 --> 13:32.313
I did.

13:34.009 --> 13:37.746
Well, I'm fantastic.
I've never been better.

13:37.846 --> 13:40.399
You don't have to worry about me anymore.

13:40.649 --> 13:42.851
You don't find it hard
to be in this house again?

13:42.951 --> 13:47.890
No, not at all. It doesn't have to be.
That's what's so incredible.

13:48.590 --> 13:52.828
- You look different, Edie.
- I am different.

13:52.928 --> 13:57.166
I'm free. All that useless pain...

13:57.266 --> 13:59.240
it's gone.

14:00.702 --> 14:05.881
It's something anyone can have, Will,
and I want you to have it, too.

14:06.641 --> 14:09.745
Eden looks hot. I can say that, right?

14:09.845 --> 14:12.204
We're all consenting adults.

14:14.282 --> 14:17.269
- It's good to see you again, Ben.
- You, too.

14:17.369 --> 14:20.480
It's been way too long.

14:21.690 --> 14:24.005
I'm just here for the food.

14:24.105 --> 14:26.601
What were you guys talking about?

14:28.897 --> 14:30.632
Not my business.

14:30.732 --> 14:34.836
I was just telling Will
that pain is optional.

14:34.936 --> 14:38.574
It is? Why didn't anyone
tell me that before now?

14:38.674 --> 14:42.811
I know. But it's actually really simple.

14:42.911 --> 14:45.181
All those negative emotions,

14:45.281 --> 14:49.752
grief, anger, depression,
is all just chemical reactions.

14:49.852 --> 14:52.888
It's entirely physical,
and it's completely changeable.

14:53.188 --> 14:55.924
Kind of sound like a pamphlet there, Eden.

14:56.024 --> 15:00.678
You can actually expel
those emotions from your body

15:00.778 --> 15:04.099
and live the life you want to live.

15:04.199 --> 15:06.908
So you're shitting out your pain?

15:08.920 --> 15:11.140
I can see you're not interested.

15:11.240 --> 15:15.197
I'm sorry, Eden.
It just sounds fucking crazy.

15:17.445 --> 15:19.821
Eden, what the fuck?

15:20.315 --> 15:24.692
Until you stop making a joke out of
everything, you'll never learn a thing.

15:25.236 --> 15:28.079
That's why nobody cares what you think.

15:30.526 --> 15:33.003
Yeah. Okay.

15:33.662 --> 15:36.071
She fucking gored me, man.

15:37.332 --> 15:39.407
That was loud.

15:40.302 --> 15:42.371
- Oh, it's not...
- For the vegetarians.

15:42.471 --> 15:45.978
- Has she been acting like this all night?
- Yeah. David, too.

15:46.408 --> 15:49.945
Look, I'm all for whatever
you gotta do to get by,

15:50.045 --> 15:54.183
especially you two, with what you went
through, but you didn't lose your mind.

15:55.183 --> 15:57.225
Oh, I didn't?

15:57.986 --> 16:00.194
Not like that.

16:04.709 --> 16:06.921
How are you?

16:07.628 --> 16:09.704
I don't know.

16:10.331 --> 16:12.034
I don't really know how to act.

16:12.334 --> 16:16.072
Well, it's not like the good old days
anymore, you know.

16:16.372 --> 16:18.881
No. No, it isn't.

16:21.309 --> 16:23.913
- Wait. Where's Amanda?
- Home with the kids.

16:24.013 --> 16:26.754
- Yeah?
- Pissed.

16:27.515 --> 16:29.958
What? What's up?

16:30.351 --> 16:32.694
Think we hate each other.

16:33.921 --> 16:37.999
- That's not good.
- Yeah. I know.

16:38.259 --> 16:42.374
But the sex is... it's so...

16:43.231 --> 16:44.740
angry.

16:46.235 --> 16:48.810
I can't get away from it, man.

16:50.945 --> 16:54.217
- It's good to see you.
- You, too.

16:56.244 --> 16:58.614
- Hey, no one cares what I think?
- No.

16:58.814 --> 17:00.449
- Come on? Really?
- No.

17:00.549 --> 17:03.919
Ben, have a glass of wine.

17:04.019 --> 17:07.295
I've let it go already, and so should you.

17:08.289 --> 17:12.666
- I'll always have a drink.
- See? It's gone already.

17:18.333 --> 17:21.279
- We'll be here.
- Come. Sit with me.

17:21.378 --> 17:23.644
Ask me a question.

17:24.439 --> 17:26.281
Okay.

17:29.578 --> 17:33.543
- Seriously, ask me a question.
- Okay. Sorry.

17:33.643 --> 17:36.151
- Wait. You're up for tenure, aren't you?
- Yeah. I got it.

17:36.251 --> 17:39.327
- Come on.
- A year ago.

17:39.787 --> 17:41.807
Year ago? Really?

17:41.907 --> 17:44.043
I had a party and everything.

17:44.193 --> 17:46.395
I'm... sorry.

17:46.495 --> 17:48.936
You don't have to be sorry.

17:49.063 --> 17:51.072
You're here now.

18:02.310 --> 18:05.155
It's weird to be here, isn't it?

18:12.287 --> 18:14.757
Maybe that's Choi, our hero.

18:15.357 --> 18:17.159
Fucking Choi.

18:24.999 --> 18:27.606
- I'm finally here.
- Yeah.

18:28.136 --> 18:29.944
Who's that?

18:32.440 --> 18:33.588
Hey.

18:37.191 --> 18:39.080
Everybody.

18:39.580 --> 18:42.471
- It's you.
- Oh, darlin'.

18:42.901 --> 18:46.455
- I can't believe you're really here.
- This is my friend Pruitt.

18:47.455 --> 18:49.697
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:49.991 --> 18:51.767
Evening.

18:53.829 --> 18:56.838
- Eden.
- How are you?

19:01.535 --> 19:03.375
Hey. I'm Ben.

19:03.475 --> 19:06.642
Nice to meet you. I'm gonna grab
a whiskey. Did you want anything?

19:06.742 --> 19:09.711
- Anything diet is fine, thanks.
- Okay.

19:10.211 --> 19:13.579
Hey. I'm Tommy. Miguel, Kira, Gina.
Nice to meet you.

19:13.849 --> 19:15.592
I have no idea.

19:15.692 --> 19:17.753
I'm glad you're here,
but frankly where the hell is Choi?

19:17.853 --> 19:19.310
Choi?

19:19.410 --> 19:23.599
Is my asshole boyfriend.
Said he was gonna be early for once.

19:24.059 --> 19:26.361
He didn't call you guys,
say he was gonna be late?

19:26.461 --> 19:28.800
No. Come on. I thought
he was gonna come with you.

19:28.900 --> 19:30.833
- Yeah, I...
- We haven't seen him.

19:30.933 --> 19:33.802
All right, that's it. I'm gonna try again.

19:35.528 --> 19:37.305
Do you guys have service up here?

19:37.405 --> 19:39.575
- Sorry.
- Horrible.

19:39.675 --> 19:42.144
And the bills fell through the cracks
while we were away.

19:42.244 --> 19:45.280
We have to get them up here and reconnect
the landline. I'm sorry, Gina.

19:45.380 --> 19:47.583
Well, he usually calls at least once.

19:47.683 --> 19:51.259
You know what? Your best bet
is gonna be in the back actually.

19:51.786 --> 19:54.061
Good luck, though.

20:01.562 --> 20:03.832
Is everything okay, Will?

20:03.932 --> 20:07.192
Yeah. Yeah, why didn't you leave
the key in the door, though?

20:07.292 --> 20:11.440
There was a home invasion
up in the canyon about a month ago.

20:11.540 --> 20:14.045
This couple got terrorized.

20:14.145 --> 20:17.479
It was really sick.
Just kinda freaked us out.

20:17.579 --> 20:21.316
- I didn't hear about it.
- Then I'm sure it never happened.

20:21.916 --> 20:24.987
Yeah, come on, Will. Can't a man
put himself in lockdown if he wants?

20:25.087 --> 20:27.095
This is America.

20:27.822 --> 20:30.265
Okay, what if there was a fire?

20:35.729 --> 20:37.538
Okay.

20:43.137 --> 20:45.112
There you go.

20:45.906 --> 20:50.246
Better? I just keep the house
a little differently. That's all.

20:50.646 --> 20:52.337
It's my house.

20:55.215 --> 20:59.171
Will, could you do me a favor
and go get some more firewood?

20:59.271 --> 21:01.073
You know where we keep it.

21:14.201 --> 21:18.413
Has he been like this a lot, so agitated?

21:20.841 --> 21:22.717
Sometimes.

21:24.378 --> 21:26.815
Well, I'm glad he has you.

21:26.915 --> 21:29.156
It comforts me.

21:30.184 --> 21:33.261
I know he wants the best for you, too.

21:33.688 --> 21:36.197
I'm glad you're here, Kira.

21:36.924 --> 21:39.167
I think it's important.

21:40.595 --> 21:42.831
Can I ask you something?

21:42.931 --> 21:45.123
How has he been handling things?

21:45.223 --> 21:47.742
He can be self-destructive.

21:50.238 --> 21:53.047
I think he's doing the best he can.

21:58.680 --> 22:02.056
<i>You're it. You're it! Come on!</i>

23:52.193 --> 23:54.502
Come back to us when you're ready.

24:07.575 --> 24:09.648
- <i>I'm telling you.</i>
- <i>Why are you doing it?</i>

24:09.748 --> 24:12.981
Because it's... you're very dirty here.

24:13.081 --> 24:15.522
- Am I?
- Yes.

24:16.518 --> 24:21.923
And it's attention to detail
that is incredibly important.

24:22.023 --> 24:24.092
- It's my credo.
- It's your credo?

24:24.192 --> 24:27.799
It's a new...
I came up with it last night. Hey.

24:27.899 --> 24:30.098
Why don't you go back to bed, okay?

24:30.498 --> 24:33.602
- We'll keep... we'll keep it down.
- Okay.

24:33.702 --> 24:36.371
Okay. I love you.

24:36.671 --> 24:38.774
- Good night, baby.
- Good night.

24:38.874 --> 24:42.279
- I love you, too. Night.
- Good night, hon.

24:43.545 --> 24:46.981
And that'll be the time he saw
his gross parents having sex.

24:47.081 --> 24:49.425
We are gross.

24:53.687 --> 24:57.299
Do you think he needs a brother?

25:05.400 --> 25:08.042
No! Oh, my...

25:08.802 --> 25:11.607
- They're in a cult.
- No, no, stop. We're not in a cult.

25:11.707 --> 25:13.675
I know plenty of people
who do the invitation.

25:13.775 --> 25:14.609
- You do?
- Yeah.

25:14.709 --> 25:17.813
- Eden, you guys really in this?
- We are.

25:17.913 --> 25:20.048
So that's why you were in Mexico?

25:20.148 --> 25:23.018
Did you get all naked
down there in the jungle?

25:23.118 --> 25:24.992
Sometimes.

25:25.752 --> 25:27.895
Well, I did.

25:28.123 --> 25:32.027
Yeah, you did. But, you know, it's just...

25:32.127 --> 25:34.529
it's just a group of people
coming together.

25:34.629 --> 25:38.267
You know, they all have lost someone,
and then they help each other.

25:38.367 --> 25:41.103
You know, it's really a science

25:41.203 --> 25:45.840
rather than, like, some weird
religious cult or anything.

25:45.940 --> 25:48.677
You know, it's smart people
like... like us,

25:48.777 --> 25:52.113
here in L.A., New York,

25:52.213 --> 25:54.349
thousands of people. You'd be surprised.

25:54.449 --> 25:58.120
Yeah, my boss is into it.
It's like a new est or something, right?

25:58.220 --> 26:00.255
Yeah, no...

26:00.555 --> 26:04.626
I think it's a little more grounded
than that, you know, more practical.

26:05.226 --> 26:08.406
And at the same time, it's very spiritual,
you know, however you define that.

26:08.506 --> 26:11.373
Seriously, what goes on down there?

26:11.473 --> 26:15.274
I mean, is it like
a self-help group thing or...

26:15.503 --> 26:17.339
Well...

26:17.439 --> 26:21.443
since you asked, we have something
that we'd like to show you.

26:21.543 --> 26:25.413
- David.
- Oh, no. Oh, no. No, no.

26:25.513 --> 26:28.796
- Perfect. Just perfect.
- Now I understand why the doors are locked.

26:28.896 --> 26:31.603
You're gonna convert us.
This is a conversion thing, right?

26:31.703 --> 26:33.939
Oh, my God. No, this is the real reason?

26:34.089 --> 26:38.160
I know it sounds a little weird,
but it's actually, it's pretty amazing stuff.

26:38.260 --> 26:40.068
Indulge us, okay.

26:40.168 --> 26:43.499
Is this some kind of a recruitment video?
I really don't want to...

26:43.599 --> 26:47.169
- I do. Convert me. I am weak.
- Yeah, you are.

26:47.269 --> 26:49.878
It's nothing like that. Promise.

26:50.705 --> 26:53.480
All right, let's do this.

27:01.148 --> 27:04.052
<i>This is our home in Sonora, Mexico,</i>

27:04.152 --> 27:07.722
<i>and it is your home, too,
if you choose it to be.</i>

27:07.822 --> 27:11.660
<i>Our home and our family is open to anyone</i>

27:11.760 --> 27:15.603
<i>with the desire to help themselves.</i>

27:16.864 --> 27:20.669
<i>The human brain has
a remarkable ability to heal.</i>

27:20.969 --> 27:26.874
<i>My life's work has been to discover
new ways to rewire, to rewrite</i>

27:26.974 --> 27:30.712
<i>our experiences with trauma.</i>

27:31.312 --> 27:34.989
<i>I mean, trauma has visited...</i>

27:35.482 --> 27:36.718
<i>all of us.</i>

27:36.818 --> 27:39.221
<i>We invite you to a conscious existence,</i>

27:39.321 --> 27:43.485
<i>to a connected existence.</i>

27:44.958 --> 27:47.865
<i>But we take this journey,
all journeys side by side.</i>

27:47.965 --> 27:50.070
<i>You are not alone.</i>

27:51.632 --> 27:53.868
<i>Wherever you are...</i>

27:53.968 --> 27:57.879
<i>we... we transcend.</i>

28:07.748 --> 28:10.418
<i>How do you feel, Annie?</i>

28:11.218 --> 28:14.262
<i>I feel loved.</i>

28:18.325 --> 28:20.361
<i>You are loved.</i>

28:20.461 --> 28:22.831
<i>You are deeply loved.</i>

28:23.431 --> 28:26.040
<i>Who are you going to see, dear?</i>

28:29.470 --> 28:31.679
<i>My husband...</i>

28:33.907 --> 28:35.777
<i>James.</i>

28:35.877 --> 28:37.919
<i>My father.</i>

28:39.613 --> 28:41.588
<i>It's all right.</i>

28:43.818 --> 28:46.488
<i>They will all be there.</i>

28:48.236 --> 28:52.300
- <i>I...</i>
- <i>Soon, Annie. Soon.</i>

28:55.997 --> 28:58.033
<i>Over soon.</i>

28:59.333 --> 29:03.938
<i>All of the pain and all of the grief,
you renounced it, haven't you?</i>

29:04.038 --> 29:06.813
<i>You've made a choice.</i>

29:10.144 --> 29:12.920
<i>You're ready to go, aren't you, honey?</i>

29:19.087 --> 29:21.990
<i>Come. Come. Breathe in.</i>

29:22.090 --> 29:24.999
<i>Breathe in. Breathe deeply.</i>

29:26.160 --> 29:29.470
- <i>You feel her spirit?</i>
- <i>I can feel it.</i>

29:30.898 --> 29:33.173
<i>I can feel it.</i>

29:54.688 --> 29:57.131
<i>She's with all of us now...</i>

29:59.660 --> 30:01.835
<i>And your father...</i>

30:02.663 --> 30:06.501
<i>And your wife... and your son.</i>

30:07.401 --> 30:09.503
<i>Don't cry.</i>

30:09.603 --> 30:13.748
<i>There's no darkness, just reunion.</i>

30:15.842 --> 30:18.852
<i>Annie is safe now.</i>

30:34.094 --> 30:36.537
This is what it's about.

30:37.597 --> 30:41.375
We did not just watch somebody die.

30:43.670 --> 30:46.814
- That was real?
- Yes, it was.

30:47.007 --> 30:49.244
Why would anyone want to watch that?

30:49.744 --> 30:54.182
She just wanted to show everyone
that there's nothing to be afraid of.

30:54.282 --> 30:58.152
That was the point. She was very sick.

30:58.252 --> 31:01.456
With what? She barely looked 30.

31:01.956 --> 31:03.688
Cancer.

31:04.158 --> 31:08.713
Look, I get it. If you gotta go
at 30, it's not a bad way,

31:08.813 --> 31:12.370
- surrounded by people who love you.
- On video?

31:12.470 --> 31:14.475
It's beautiful.

31:15.537 --> 31:17.572
It's a little grim.

31:17.672 --> 31:20.551
She looked at peace to me.
I'm not judging her.

31:20.651 --> 31:24.012
- No, I know, babe.
- Yeah, no one's judging her.

31:24.112 --> 31:27.538
I just don't understand why you'd show
something like that at a dinner party, David.

31:29.049 --> 31:31.002
You don't get it?

31:31.452 --> 31:34.999
I guess this is not really
being taken the way we meant it.

31:35.099 --> 31:38.927
I mean, it is a pretty heavy thing
to drop on us, David.

31:39.027 --> 31:42.363
But it's not heavy. For us, it's not.

31:42.563 --> 31:45.480
- No.
- It's okay. Not everybody gets it.

31:45.580 --> 31:49.461
It's not about the fact that she died.
We all die.

31:49.671 --> 31:53.291
- What's it about?
- It's about communion.

31:53.391 --> 31:55.310
Right, like Eden said,

31:55.410 --> 32:00.253
she's just trying to show you
that there's nothing to be afraid of.

32:02.215 --> 32:06.571
Look at me. My pain had turned me
into some walking clichÃ©.

32:06.671 --> 32:11.309
I was a coked-up, out-of-control
record producer, for God's sake.

32:11.409 --> 32:14.145
I was a slave to my own grief...

32:14.895 --> 32:17.231
but not anymore.

32:17.331 --> 32:19.967
Dr. Joseph freed me from that.

32:20.067 --> 32:21.943
I just...

32:22.803 --> 32:25.473
He gave me back my center, you know?

32:25.573 --> 32:29.617
- I don't have to be afraid anymore.
- Amen, brother.

32:32.914 --> 32:36.250
You know, we've all been
through horrible things,

32:36.350 --> 32:40.027
but those things don't have to define us.

32:41.621 --> 32:45.877
- What happened to Eden and Will...
- No, don't. Don't! David, don't.

32:45.977 --> 32:48.852
Finding this saved my life.

32:49.629 --> 32:52.834
I almost died after.
I almost couldn't keep on living.

32:52.934 --> 32:55.035
You know that, Will.

32:55.135 --> 32:59.179
But look at me now. I'm great. I'm happy.

33:00.374 --> 33:02.977
I'm not angry anymore.

33:03.277 --> 33:07.054
And if anyone is gonna try
to take that away from me...

33:09.650 --> 33:13.260
My God, look at the way
you're looking at me.

33:17.057 --> 33:19.027
If anyone is gonna try
to say that this isn't...

33:19.127 --> 33:23.064
Edie, I... Edie...
it's just you don't think I know?

33:23.164 --> 33:25.003
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- I know!

33:25.103 --> 33:27.235
- Let's get a drink.
- It's just that easy for you?

33:27.335 --> 33:30.093
Come on. Come on. Let's get a drink.

33:38.245 --> 33:40.282
Yeah, we all are lost.

33:40.382 --> 33:43.156
We can agree on that, right?

33:43.917 --> 33:45.993
It's just...

33:48.855 --> 33:50.964
It's too big.

33:52.259 --> 33:54.868
It's too big for any of us alone.

33:57.130 --> 33:59.139
You got to...

34:05.206 --> 34:08.949
- That better be...
- No, I've got it. I've got it. I got it.

34:13.313 --> 34:14.616
David.

34:15.815 --> 34:17.324
Sorry.

34:18.085 --> 34:20.293
Excuse me for a second.

34:28.128 --> 34:29.830
Hi there.

34:29.929 --> 34:31.599
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:31.699 --> 34:33.868
- Are you okay?
- I'm sorry.

34:33.967 --> 34:36.335
No, not you.

34:36.436 --> 34:39.206
I mean, I knew it was
gonna be heavy, but...

34:39.306 --> 34:43.210
I was just... why Choi and I were
supposed to be here together for you.

34:43.310 --> 34:46.547
We have to make a better effort.
It's on us, and...

34:46.647 --> 34:48.882
I was trying to give you space,

34:48.983 --> 34:53.789
and I don't know if that came across
like I was checked out. It's...

34:57.091 --> 34:59.633
Okay, hello. I don't...

35:00.961 --> 35:04.766
- You haven't heard a word I said, have you?
- I'm sorry, Gina.

35:04.866 --> 35:08.836
Just a couple people
looking for a party... on foot.

35:08.936 --> 35:12.880
- Good luck. They'll die of dehydration.
- Yeah.

35:17.077 --> 35:19.714
Anyway, we can talk later.

35:19.814 --> 35:23.451
I just... I wanted you to know that...

35:23.551 --> 35:25.820
I have been thinking about you.

35:25.920 --> 35:27.188
- Yeah.
- All right?

35:27.288 --> 35:28.857
- I love you...
- I love you, too.

35:28.957 --> 35:32.332
- I miss you.
- I miss you, too.

35:33.593 --> 35:36.837
- I'm gonna get a refill.
- Get a... get a drink.

35:46.472 --> 35:49.476
I feel like you guys
have to come to my house...

36:16.870 --> 36:19.846
Are you gonna come
and join us at some point?

36:21.375 --> 36:23.183
Will?

36:24.811 --> 36:27.254
Can you tell me what that is?

36:27.380 --> 36:28.883
It is a pill, Will.

36:28.983 --> 36:31.223
I found a bunch of it
in Eden's bedroom unlabeled...

36:31.323 --> 36:34.261
- Wait. What are you...
- Please just look at it.

36:36.590 --> 36:39.160
- It's Phenobarbital, I think.
- Is that dangerous?

36:39.260 --> 36:42.563
Anything is dangerous
if you take too much of it.

36:42.663 --> 36:45.500
It's a barbiturate. I mean,
it's old-school, but it's...

36:45.800 --> 36:50.770
not unusual to find it if you're rifling
through somebody's medicine cabinet.

36:50.870 --> 36:54.414
Hey, hey, break up your little clique.
Come talk to us.

36:55.375 --> 36:57.445
Come on. Let's go.

36:58.345 --> 37:00.848
Apparently V.I.P. room is in the kitchen.

37:00.948 --> 37:04.819
Guys, guys, guys, join us, please.
Just opened another bottle.

37:04.919 --> 37:07.455
- Oh, yes.
- Probably needs a little more air.

37:07.555 --> 37:09.657
I mean it, Miguel.
Just keep it between us.

37:09.757 --> 37:11.192
Okay, Snoopy.

37:11.292 --> 37:13.361
- Oh, man.
- Can you give this one to Miguel?

37:13.461 --> 37:15.096
- Yeah.
- <i>Gracias.</i>

37:15.196 --> 37:17.098
<i>De nada.</i>

37:17.198 --> 37:19.072
Smell that.

37:19.366 --> 37:21.141
Okay.

37:22.102 --> 37:24.872
- <i>Salud.</i>
- <i>Salud.</i>

37:24.972 --> 37:26.880
Will thinks you guys are on pills.

37:28.375 --> 37:30.310
Figuratively.

37:30.410 --> 37:32.947
- You think we're crazy?
- I never said that.

37:33.047 --> 37:37.424
That's okay. I'm not offended.
A lot of people think we're crazy.

37:38.918 --> 37:42.262
But I doubt they're as happy as we are.

37:43.958 --> 37:46.235
Where's the diet again?

37:50.964 --> 37:53.234
- Why?
- <i>No comprendo inglÃ©s.</i>

37:53.334 --> 37:54.902
- Thank you.
- <i>De nada.</i>

37:55.002 --> 37:57.371
Don't you guys think
this is a little bit weird?

37:57.471 --> 38:01.781
Look, Will, there is no way that tonight
wasn't gonna feel a little strange...

38:02.175 --> 38:04.678
Or sad.

38:04.778 --> 38:09.483
Look, this is just a long-overdue reunion
between old friends...

38:09.950 --> 38:13.988
with a couple of totally
frickin' friend weirdoes.

38:14.088 --> 38:16.409
- They're a little Mansony.
- "Mansonian"?

38:16.509 --> 38:19.177
- And that skinny girl...
- Look, I'm not kidding. Come on.

38:19.277 --> 38:21.829
I got you. Look at me.

38:21.929 --> 38:25.299
Yeah, they're a little weird,
but this is L.A. They're harmless.

38:26.099 --> 38:30.037
Let's just get through this night, give them
a break. Let's steal some more of this wine.

38:30.137 --> 38:32.674
Now, that is something
I can get behind. Come on.

38:32.774 --> 38:35.541
Hey, guys, listen! I...

38:35.641 --> 38:41.367
I realize that some of you might have found
that video a little disturbing or off-putting,

38:41.847 --> 38:44.252
- and I apologize for that.
- It's cool.

38:44.352 --> 38:45.887
No, Gina, it's not.

38:45.987 --> 38:50.057
Last thing I want you guys to think is
that I'm trying to force my ideas on you.

38:50.157 --> 38:51.326
Welcome back.

38:51.426 --> 38:54.562
You know, it's just
I want you guys to know me.

38:54.662 --> 38:58.559
There's this game we used to play
in Mexico at the end of group,

38:58.659 --> 39:00.868
and I think we should try it.

39:00.968 --> 39:04.605
- What kind of game are we talking about?
- Like charades or something?

39:04.705 --> 39:07.809
It'll be fun, and it'll give you
a sense of what we learned, right?

39:07.909 --> 39:10.635
- I'm in. What is it?
- Okay.

39:10.735 --> 39:14.748
It's kind of like that game
we played in college, "I never."

39:14.848 --> 39:17.618
- I always lose that game.
- Oh, I never do.

39:17.718 --> 39:20.721
Except this time, it's "I want,"

39:20.821 --> 39:24.155
so we take turns, and everybody
gets to say what they want.

39:24.255 --> 39:28.397
- I want to hear what Gina did in college.
- You mean who she did.

39:28.497 --> 39:31.596
But the point is to be honest.

39:31.696 --> 39:33.831
All right? To admit your desires.

39:33.931 --> 39:37.421
You know, because anything is possible
once you strip away

39:37.521 --> 39:39.704
social constraints and embarrassment

39:39.804 --> 39:45.141
and those negative emotions that,
you know, the things that hold us down.

39:46.242 --> 39:49.880
So honesty, okay? That's what it's about.

39:49.980 --> 39:52.289
<b>Want to give it a shot?</b>

39:53.116 --> 39:56.059
- I'll go first.
- Wonderful.

39:57.454 --> 39:59.282
Okay.

40:00.073 --> 40:02.369
I want...

40:03.293 --> 40:07.504
to tell you, Eden, and David...

40:07.864 --> 40:12.857
Will and Kira and Gina...

40:12.957 --> 40:15.473
- Miguel...
- Pack a lunch.

40:15.573 --> 40:17.975
And Tommy... there are so many.

40:18.075 --> 40:22.947
Ben, Claire, Pruitt...

40:23.347 --> 40:26.723
I want to tell you all that I love you.

40:28.017 --> 40:31.978
I know I haven't known
some of you for very long, but...

40:32.078 --> 40:35.559
tonight I feel love.

40:35.659 --> 40:37.467
I do.

40:38.561 --> 40:42.666
And a lot of people don't say that.
They're afraid.

40:42.766 --> 40:45.794
But... so...

40:45.894 --> 40:47.977
I love you.

40:53.111 --> 40:55.346
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, my.

40:55.746 --> 40:57.988
Oh, my gosh.

41:01.084 --> 41:03.054
This is...

41:04.688 --> 41:06.757
Hi there.

41:06.857 --> 41:08.794
You get it?

41:08.894 --> 41:10.535
All right.

41:11.579 --> 41:14.455
I want...

41:16.032 --> 41:18.569
some of that coke you used to do.

41:18.869 --> 41:21.392
Done. I think I might have some more.

41:21.492 --> 41:24.942
You keep it in the house?
You're the worst rehabber in the world.

41:25.042 --> 41:28.810
- No, David, don't. I was kidding.
- No, you weren't.

41:28.910 --> 41:31.388
That's okay. That's the point of the game.

41:32.982 --> 41:35.890
Okay. I wasn't kidding.

41:36.720 --> 41:39.140
Bust that shit out.

41:39.240 --> 41:42.693
- There you go.
- I like this game.

41:43.193 --> 41:46.102
I want to tell you about my wife Margaret.

41:47.830 --> 41:50.835
We were married eight years...

41:50.935 --> 41:53.576
would have been 15 next month.

41:54.104 --> 41:57.747
She was a painter, oils.

42:00.076 --> 42:03.548
First saw her work
at this artists retreat in Minneapolis.

42:04.348 --> 42:06.750
I was in love with her
before I even met her.

42:06.850 --> 42:08.628
These...

42:09.228 --> 42:13.115
abstract, energetic landscapes...

42:15.091 --> 42:17.501
and then I saw her.

42:19.429 --> 42:21.838
It was like I'd hit the jackpot.

42:23.032 --> 42:26.270
She was the most
generous spirit I'd ever seen,

42:26.370 --> 42:30.347
and she was as bright and gorgeous as...

42:31.708 --> 42:33.716
the morning.

42:35.278 --> 42:39.968
When you surprised her,
she had this laugh, this...

42:40.068 --> 42:45.589
joyous, guttural rumble that came
from way down deep inside.

42:45.689 --> 42:48.532
You knew you'd done something good.

42:49.926 --> 42:53.570
She was all light, all light.

42:55.031 --> 43:00.246
During times like this,
nights like this night...

43:01.404 --> 43:03.623
I think of her quite a bit.

43:03.723 --> 43:06.446
Did she... pass away?

43:08.344 --> 43:10.587
Yes, she did.

43:11.013 --> 43:13.389
We had been drinking.

43:14.617 --> 43:16.954
I had been drinking.

43:17.254 --> 43:20.257
We had just come home from a dinner,
and we were in the kitchen.

43:20.357 --> 43:24.164
We'd fell into one of those arguments,
you know, one of those...

43:24.264 --> 43:27.530
stupid fights that last
your whole marriage.

43:27.630 --> 43:30.206
It was about the dishes.

43:31.200 --> 43:33.857
Somebody started yelling.

43:33.957 --> 43:36.345
I don't remember who.

43:37.073 --> 43:41.451
I went to pour myself another drink.
She tried to stop me, and...

43:43.012 --> 43:45.488
something just gave.

43:46.249 --> 43:49.058
I turned and hit her as hard as I could.

43:50.653 --> 43:55.268
Her knees buckled. She hit her head.

44:00.713 --> 44:03.633
Think she was trying to get back up.

44:03.733 --> 44:06.237
You know, she had her hand out...

44:06.337 --> 44:08.578
was staring at me.

44:09.372 --> 44:11.386
And then...

44:11.736 --> 44:15.435
she collapsed, and she was gone.

44:20.166 --> 44:22.375
What the fuck?

44:24.153 --> 44:27.297
It was a terrible, terrible mistake.

44:27.397 --> 44:32.396
It was seven years ago.
I went to prison. I paid that way...

44:32.496 --> 44:34.905
but I was still the same person.

44:37.600 --> 44:40.025
Finally, by...

44:40.925 --> 44:43.673
accepting the invitation...

44:43.773 --> 44:46.344
And looking only ahead...

44:46.844 --> 44:49.547
destroying that horrible part of me

44:49.647 --> 44:52.388
that made that moment possible...

44:54.651 --> 44:56.693
I'm cured.

44:57.320 --> 45:00.663
And I miss her.

45:03.526 --> 45:06.497
Not a day goes by I don't think of her.

45:07.597 --> 45:11.135
But I don't grieve,
and I don't feel guilty anymore.

45:11.235 --> 45:13.937
I've chosen to let that go.

45:14.037 --> 45:16.835
Those emotions are useless, because...

45:16.935 --> 45:22.009
I'm gonna be seeing her again
in a better place than this.

45:23.412 --> 45:26.450
That's what we believe. That's what
most people have believed for centuries.

45:26.550 --> 45:29.092
I, for one, can't wait to get there.

45:30.720 --> 45:35.098
But forgiveness doesn't have to wait.

45:36.025 --> 45:40.758
I'm free to forgive myself,
and so are you.

45:42.365 --> 45:44.774
It's a beautiful thing.

45:45.435 --> 45:47.643
It really is.

45:56.679 --> 46:01.485
What's more honorable, facing
the truth or hiding it to be accepted?

46:01.585 --> 46:03.387
And people change.

46:03.487 --> 46:06.790
I don't know.
This... doesn't seem very honest.

46:07.490 --> 46:10.794
It feels like you're selling us something.

46:11.394 --> 46:14.864
- No, we aren't.
- I want...

46:14.964 --> 46:17.556
- Are we really gonna keep doing this?
- I want...

46:17.656 --> 46:21.143
- This better be good.
- I want to kiss Ben.

46:22.204 --> 46:24.348
I always have.

46:32.683 --> 46:35.119
Why the hell not? Bring it, sister.

46:35.219 --> 46:36.153
Oh, my God.

46:36.253 --> 46:40.130
- I want to kiss Ben.
- One per party.

46:42.024 --> 46:44.567
- Boom. No?
- No.

46:48.630 --> 46:50.674
Yeah!

46:53.009 --> 46:54.972
Get it, girl.

46:55.072 --> 46:56.913
Go!

46:59.308 --> 47:01.277
Jeez.

47:01.377 --> 47:03.980
I don't know if I approve that.

47:05.214 --> 47:07.424
And nobody tells Amanda.

47:08.851 --> 47:11.422
- I want a blow job...
- Oh, you're ridiculous.

47:11.522 --> 47:14.530
- From somebody.
- Oh, I know.

47:15.426 --> 47:18.228
- What? I'm not joking.
- I have to go.

47:18.328 --> 47:20.865
Come on. We're just having fun.
It's all right.

47:20.965 --> 47:25.502
This is all making me
a little uncomfortable. I'm sorry.

47:25.602 --> 47:29.206
Come on. Have a seat. I'll get you a drink.
We'll do something else.

47:29.306 --> 47:33.544
No, no, no. I don't want to spoil
anyone's fun. This just isn't my thing.

47:33.644 --> 47:37.114
- Claire, please.
- Just... just let her go, David.

47:37.614 --> 47:39.949
Why can't she just leave?

47:40.049 --> 47:44.121
Will, I just want her to stay
and have a good time...

47:44.421 --> 47:47.524
and Eden has planned this night for
a long time. We'll be very disappointed.

47:47.624 --> 47:50.666
Well, just let her do
what she wants, okay?

47:50.927 --> 47:53.202
I'm gonna leave.

47:54.864 --> 47:57.768
- Of course.
- Bye.

47:57.868 --> 47:59.970
I'm sorry if I've made you
feel uncomfortable.

48:00.070 --> 48:02.772
It's... it's okay. I'm tired.

48:02.872 --> 48:06.543
Claire, why don't you
just stay a little longer?

48:06.643 --> 48:09.012
I'll see you again soon, okay?

48:09.112 --> 48:11.387
I'm really sorry.

48:13.383 --> 48:15.658
Okay, Claire.

48:16.786 --> 48:19.490
Eden, it's okay.

48:19.590 --> 48:21.664
I know.

48:22.591 --> 48:26.969
- Do you want me to walk you to your car?
- It's, like, 40 feet, Will.

48:27.630 --> 48:30.497
- Bye.
- Bye, Claire.

48:31.635 --> 48:34.438
- Are you in the Prius?
- Yeah.

48:34.838 --> 48:37.413
I parked behind you.

48:43.295 --> 48:45.556
Thank you, guys.

48:55.991 --> 48:58.395
Hey, Will, come over here, and talk to me.

48:58.495 --> 49:00.603
Just give me a sec.

49:26.532 --> 49:28.991
Careful on the right.

49:29.091 --> 49:30.961
Okay.

49:31.161 --> 49:35.024
Straight out. You're all set.

49:40.369 --> 49:42.846
Oh, Claire.

49:47.343 --> 49:50.186
Will, come on.

49:51.514 --> 49:54.585
Can you and I talk alone for a minute?

49:54.685 --> 49:56.759
It's important.

49:57.520 --> 50:00.857
Yeah. Yeah.

50:01.367 --> 50:03.232
Come on.

50:05.761 --> 50:07.827
I'm very happy you're here.

50:07.927 --> 50:11.468
It's so important to Eden and me.

50:11.568 --> 50:14.471
I mean, we chose you
because you matter to us.

50:14.571 --> 50:17.680
- You chose me?
- To be here tonight.

50:18.674 --> 50:21.144
But I don't know, man.

50:21.244 --> 50:26.049
You've been acting so...
suspicious of our hospitality.

50:26.149 --> 50:27.985
Frankly, it upsets me a little.

50:28.085 --> 50:31.788
I lock the door,
and you have a fit about it.

50:31.888 --> 50:34.992
Just now, my friend wants to move his car,

50:35.092 --> 50:38.428
and you're standing by the window like
you're gonna catch him stealing something.

50:38.928 --> 50:41.671
You seem very distant, very...

50:42.064 --> 50:45.307
just off somehow.

50:47.269 --> 50:49.312
I'm sorry.

50:51.207 --> 50:54.231
Maybe I wasn't prepared
to be here tonight.

50:56.245 --> 50:59.182
Okay. Okay.

50:59.282 --> 51:01.752
I appreciate your honesty.

51:01.852 --> 51:03.673
Look, I...

51:03.773 --> 51:07.174
I understand that you feel
like you have to be on the lookout.

51:07.724 --> 51:10.209
I know, because that's how I felt.

51:10.309 --> 51:14.298
The world is unsafe and chaotic,
and, you know, it happened before.

51:14.398 --> 51:16.804
It can always happen again. David, please.

51:16.904 --> 51:20.237
I don't pretend to know
what you went through with your wife...

51:20.637 --> 51:23.913
and you don't know me. You can't.

51:31.780 --> 51:34.284
- Hey.
- Hi.

51:34.384 --> 51:39.962
I tried to convince Claire to stay.
I felt bad about, my story scaring her.

51:40.990 --> 51:43.466
She seemed to understand.

52:47.990 --> 52:51.394
I swear to God, every day I get
an email, and it's just I'm going,

52:51.494 --> 52:54.397
"what is this? Is this, like,
gonna kill my hard drive?"

52:54.497 --> 52:57.467
And it's usually some stupid
fricking video of, like...

52:57.567 --> 52:59.403
How many cat videos has Claire sent you?

52:59.503 --> 53:03.473
- Claire has sent me cat videos so...
- Every day, it's a cat video.

53:03.573 --> 53:06.520
I mean, I got a cat video.
I got a penguin video.

53:06.620 --> 53:09.257
- Penguins. Penguins are overrated.
- Overrated?

53:09.357 --> 53:12.448
- Yeah. Yeah. They are.
- Here we go...

54:06.969 --> 54:09.122
<i>You're it.</i>

54:38.201 --> 54:40.076
Kira.

54:42.338 --> 54:43.713
Kira.

54:44.674 --> 54:46.483
Kira.

56:23.505 --> 56:26.091
So things aren't great with Kira?

56:27.509 --> 56:30.219
What... why would you say that?

56:30.846 --> 56:33.216
Just seems like that to me.

56:33.316 --> 56:35.825
Seems like she's real distant.

56:36.719 --> 56:38.561
No.

56:39.188 --> 56:41.196
No, she's great.

56:45.894 --> 56:49.275
- Should we go back inside?
- No. I'm gonna make a call.

56:52.067 --> 56:56.138
Oh, good luck. There's no service up here.

56:56.238 --> 56:58.647
No, it goes in and out.

56:59.608 --> 57:01.817
I could hang with you.

57:05.413 --> 57:08.491
- You could fuck me right here.
- What?

57:09.852 --> 57:12.661
Why should we deny ourselves ever?

57:13.322 --> 57:17.193
It's what it was like in Mexico.
Man, everyone was just going for it.

57:17.293 --> 57:19.301
It was awesome.

57:20.262 --> 57:23.305
I think you need to go back inside.

57:23.899 --> 57:25.869
You don't like me?

57:25.969 --> 57:28.076
I don't know you.

57:28.570 --> 57:31.213
I could make you like me so much.

57:32.374 --> 57:34.817
I could make you beg me.

57:35.444 --> 57:38.394
Could do it without even touching you...

57:39.515 --> 57:41.990
just with my voice...

57:43.352 --> 57:46.528
- my breath.
- Sadie.

57:47.456 --> 57:49.798
You can hurt me if you want.

57:50.425 --> 57:52.768
I don't want to hurt you.

57:57.032 --> 57:59.241
I don't believe you.

58:05.808 --> 58:08.151
Hey. What are you doing out here?

58:11.213 --> 58:13.103
I needed a break.

58:13.203 --> 58:16.353
Oh, really? From what?

58:17.253 --> 58:19.389
Tommy, there's something wrong here.

58:19.489 --> 58:22.958
- Will...
- Something bad is happening here.

58:23.058 --> 58:25.395
You're wrong. Look, and I know
what you're gonna say,

58:25.495 --> 58:29.565
but Claire left because that poor girl
is sexually awkward.

58:29.665 --> 58:35.574
Choi is the most unreliable Korean
in Los Angeles. He could be anywhere.

58:35.674 --> 58:37.946
And Eden...

58:39.041 --> 58:41.717
I haven't seen her for two years.

58:42.895 --> 58:44.507
It's crazy.

58:46.815 --> 58:50.292
But we're all trying to figure out
how to go on, you know.

58:50.702 --> 58:54.724
- This is how they do it.
- Something doesn't feel safe here.

58:54.824 --> 58:59.112
Of course it doesn't feel safe. Took a lot
of courage for you to come here tonight,

58:59.212 --> 59:02.287
but you're letting your mind
run away with things.

59:04.299 --> 59:06.108
Hey...

59:06.568 --> 59:08.777
I love you, Will.

59:10.539 --> 59:14.243
But you gotta stop acting so fucking weird.
It's freaking people out.

59:24.786 --> 59:27.095
You're safe, okay?

59:30.325 --> 59:32.268
I'll see you back inside.

01:00:00.688 --> 01:00:02.425
<i>Will, Choi. What's up?</i>

01:00:02.525 --> 01:00:05.495
<i>Listen, it's about 7:00,
and I'm pulling up to Eden's house.</i>

01:00:05.595 --> 01:00:09.298
<i>I forgot to pick up dessert like I said
I would, and I can't get ahold of Gina.</i>

01:00:09.398 --> 01:00:11.234
<i>Could you get some on your way? I...</i>

01:00:11.334 --> 01:00:15.038
<i>Look, I'm early, dude.
I'm actually early, but honestly</i>

01:00:15.138 --> 01:00:18.274
<i>I don't want to go back down the hill
and look for a fucking patisserie.</i>

01:00:18.374 --> 01:00:22.040
<i>I hope you get this.
See you here in a few, I guess.</i>

01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:25.053
<i>I'm goin' in. Okay, bye.</i>

01:00:53.008 --> 01:00:54.377
There he is.

01:00:54.477 --> 01:00:57.018
- See?
- Hey, buddy.

01:00:57.146 --> 01:00:59.850
- I want to play "I want." I want...
- No more blow jobs.

01:00:59.950 --> 01:01:03.019
I like this game.
Was it obvious that I like the game?

01:01:03.119 --> 01:01:05.817
- I have room. I could do it.
- He has room for everything.

01:01:05.917 --> 01:01:08.858
- We both enjoyed that game.
- We did.

01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:12.728
I think this is a new game.

01:01:12.828 --> 01:01:15.870
- All right, I'm scared.
- This is the next game.

01:01:16.533 --> 01:01:19.769
Maybe this is one of those guess who...

01:01:20.369 --> 01:01:23.573
So pretty. So purty.

01:01:23.673 --> 01:01:26.209
- It is lovely.
- Stop it right now.

01:01:26.459 --> 01:01:30.313
What is going on here?

01:01:30.413 --> 01:01:32.898
- Happy birthday.
- What is this about?

01:01:32.998 --> 01:01:36.736
- It's not for another week.
- It's close enough.

01:01:37.486 --> 01:01:40.524
Okay, please, please. But no singing.

01:01:40.624 --> 01:01:44.928
Please? Please? Please?
Thank you. It's wish time.

01:01:45.528 --> 01:01:49.078
- Make it good. Make it good.
- Yeah.

01:01:50.752 --> 01:01:52.235
You attacked that one.

01:01:52.335 --> 01:01:54.671
- Bastard.
- Well done.

01:01:54.771 --> 01:01:56.940
- Where's Choi?
- Excuse me?

01:01:57.340 --> 01:02:00.216
Where's Choi?
I mean, where the fuck is Choi?

01:02:00.316 --> 01:02:02.846
- What are you talking about, Will?
- I got a message from him.

01:02:02.946 --> 01:02:06.015
He said he was here,
that he had gotten here at 7:00.

01:02:06.115 --> 01:02:08.351
- What?
- He said he was here.

01:02:08.751 --> 01:02:11.955
- Eden, is that true?
- I haven't seen Choi tonight.

01:02:12.455 --> 01:02:15.124
- Edie, where is he?
- Will, stop, please. Just...

01:02:15.224 --> 01:02:19.128
No. No. I just got a message from him.
He said he was here.

01:02:19.228 --> 01:02:22.349
- He made the call from right outside.
- We haven't seen him.

01:02:22.449 --> 01:02:24.934
Don't fucking lie to me. He called
from right outside your front door.

01:02:25.034 --> 01:02:28.314
David is not lying to you.
Choi never got here.

01:02:28.704 --> 01:02:32.342
- Maybe he turned around, man.
- He might have forgotten something, Will.

01:02:32.442 --> 01:02:35.851
Yeah, why is everyone
acting so fucking polite?

01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:40.083
- Where's Choi?
- Hey, Eden, what's going on?

01:02:40.183 --> 01:02:43.519
I have not seen Choi tonight,
Gina, I swear.

01:02:43.619 --> 01:02:45.888
Something isn't right here.

01:02:45.988 --> 01:02:49.158
There is something
very strange going on here,

01:02:49.258 --> 01:02:51.310
and no one is saying anything.

01:02:51.410 --> 01:02:54.764
- What do you think is happening, Will?
- Hey, who are you?

01:02:55.464 --> 01:02:59.068
See, see, I don't get
why you two are here.

01:02:59.168 --> 01:03:02.138
- Hey, these are my guests.
- Yeah.

01:03:02.238 --> 01:03:03.759
Two years.

01:03:03.859 --> 01:03:07.276
We don't see you for two years,
and then all of a sudden,

01:03:07.376 --> 01:03:10.116
we get invited to this lavish dinner.

01:03:10.216 --> 01:03:14.367
You're all smiles, spewing out all
this jargon with these two in tow.

01:03:14.467 --> 01:03:18.694
Don't tell me that this is normal...
the invitation.

01:03:18.794 --> 01:03:20.724
- It helps people.
- Will, everybody's allowed...

01:03:20.824 --> 01:03:24.427
No, it's a fucking cult, Miguel!
It's a fucking cult!

01:03:24.527 --> 01:03:26.996
- Will, sit down!
- No! No, look at the video, okay?

01:03:27.096 --> 01:03:30.166
It's not about communion. It's not
about family. It's about fucking denial.

01:03:30.266 --> 01:03:33.236
- You are out of line.
- All right, no, it's about denial.

01:03:33.336 --> 01:03:36.456
You know what it is?
It's a fucking brainwash.

01:03:37.006 --> 01:03:40.576
Our son died, Edie,
and you're trying to ignore it.

01:03:40.676 --> 01:03:45.248
It meant something when he died,
and don't you try to erase that.

01:03:45.348 --> 01:03:49.751
Ty was real. It was rea... it is real.

01:03:49.851 --> 01:03:53.328
Please, please, Edie.

01:04:00.161 --> 01:04:03.436
- Where's Choi?
- Will, she said she doesn't know.

01:04:03.536 --> 01:04:05.668
I think this is
just a big misunderstanding.

01:04:05.768 --> 01:04:08.271
Don't fucking patronize me, David.
Why don't you tell me something?

01:04:08.371 --> 01:04:13.076
Why are all the doors locked?
Okay, why are all the bars on the windows?
