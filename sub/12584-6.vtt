WEBVTT

00:34.409 --> 00:37.162


00:41.458 --> 00:42.959
Can you believe it, Minh?

00:43.043 --> 00:45.920
Ted Wassanasong
actually invite us to his home.

00:46.004 --> 00:47.255
What a place.

00:47.338 --> 00:51.676
I can't tell if that's a high-def TV
or window overlooking African safari.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.094
You know, it's funny,

00:53.178 --> 00:55.472
even another person's money
can make me happy.

00:55.722 --> 00:56.848
Oh...

00:56.931 --> 00:58.016
Minh.

00:58.266 --> 00:59.517
Look at that swimming pool.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.394
The classic, simple rectangle.

01:01.478 --> 01:04.105
The tiles so tastefully filigreed.

01:04.189 --> 01:06.858
That is the pool of a man of substance.

01:06.941 --> 01:08.485
Welcome, Kahn and Minh.

01:08.568 --> 01:09.944
I hope you're enjoying yourselves.

01:10.028 --> 01:12.197
Your home is beautiful, Ted.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.156
Thank you.

01:13.239 --> 01:14.532
As fellow Laotians,

01:14.616 --> 01:17.243
I knew you would appreciate
the lowland influences

01:17.327 --> 01:18.703
on the architecture and decor.

01:18.787 --> 01:19.746
Yeah.

01:20.038 --> 01:22.457
So did it come with that pool
or did you have to put it in?

01:23.041 --> 01:23.917
Minh, Kahn,

01:24.000 --> 01:25.835
I'd like you to meet my dear friend,

01:25.919 --> 01:27.212
Nguc Phong.

01:27.295 --> 01:29.089
Legendary Lao guerrilla fighter

01:29.172 --> 01:31.633
who lead brave assaults
against communist forces?

01:31.716 --> 01:33.802
I am that same soldier.

01:34.969 --> 01:37.555
How about that, Minh?
This guy serious butt-kicker.

01:37.889 --> 01:40.391
Anyway, I'm sorry
they kill all your friends.

01:40.475 --> 01:43.561
Yes, that was unhappy for me.

01:43.645 --> 01:47.398
But every day, I devote
to honoring their memory,

01:47.482 --> 01:50.360
to preserving the culture of our people.

01:50.443 --> 01:51.986
Yeah, well, that sound good.

01:52.570 --> 01:53.780
Now about the pool,

01:53.863 --> 01:56.407
what you think a smaller version of it
in my backyard cost?

02:00.620 --> 02:01.538
And remember,

02:01.621 --> 02:04.916
I want same tiles you use
with Ted Wassanasong's pool.

02:05.416 --> 02:07.919
Right. Here's my estimate.

02:10.130 --> 02:11.881


02:12.757 --> 02:13.675
Yep.

02:14.384 --> 02:15.760
-
Yep.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.931
My dreams are shattered.

02:20.014 --> 02:22.183
Yep, mine, too. Have a beer.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.602
Ever since I see Ted's pool,

02:24.686 --> 02:27.689
I can think of nothing
but having one in my own backyard.

02:27.772 --> 02:29.357
But it too expensive.

02:29.440 --> 02:30.859
Well, it doesn't have to be.

02:31.192 --> 02:35.655
A pool is basically a concrete shell
with a suction and return system

02:35.738 --> 02:37.115
and some motor-assisted plumbing.

02:37.198 --> 02:38.408
Mm-hmm.

02:38.491 --> 02:41.119
Yeah. Yeah, you just need
to find a few guys

02:41.202 --> 02:43.371
who enjoy doing construction
in their spare time,

02:43.454 --> 02:45.874
and offer them rights to use the pool.

02:45.957 --> 02:48.501
Something's happening here.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.129
Oh, my God, we're gonna build a pool.

02:51.212 --> 02:52.380
Really?

02:52.463 --> 02:54.257
Wingo.

03:02.932 --> 03:05.101
This hard hat is my armor.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.603
When you're working construction,

03:06.686 --> 03:08.897
your head is still
your most valuable tool,

03:08.980 --> 03:10.982
so you've got to protect it...

03:11.733 --> 03:13.151
Huh?

03:14.485 --> 03:15.945
A rectangular pool.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.948
It'll be like having a mid-level motel
next door.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.241
I can't believe it.

03:20.325 --> 03:23.077
That giant hole filled with dirt

03:23.161 --> 03:25.872
is the place I'm gonna spend
the rest of my childhood.

03:25.955 --> 03:27.332
Well, before you do,

03:27.415 --> 03:31.252
you're gonna train in swimming, CPR,
and pool etiquette.

03:32.253 --> 03:34.505
Huh. I'm still excited.

03:47.685 --> 03:51.439
Is it possible that our life
has finally achieved total perfection?

03:52.023 --> 03:54.359
Tell me, what is Connie's
grade-point average?

03:54.442 --> 03:55.276
Is it A?

03:55.360 --> 03:56.611
A-plus.

03:56.694 --> 03:58.363
And what kind of steak is that?

03:58.446 --> 03:59.530
Is it choice?

03:59.614 --> 04:00.782
Prime.

04:00.865 --> 04:03.701
And that pool in my backyard,
is it a hallucination?

04:03.785 --> 04:05.203
No, it's real.

04:05.286 --> 04:09.123
So it is true, then,
our lives are nearly perfect.

04:09.207 --> 04:12.126
Only missing element is membership
in Nine Rivers Country Club.

04:12.710 --> 04:16.339
Well, Ted Wassanasong
is on membership committee...

04:16.422 --> 04:18.132
Of course. And he like us now.

04:18.216 --> 04:21.803
Oh, this coming together very nicely.

04:34.357 --> 04:36.442
Oh, hello, Ted.

04:36.776 --> 04:37.944
Well, this hilarious.

04:38.027 --> 04:41.656
I just come to shop for new five-iron,
but then I run into you guys.

04:41.739 --> 04:43.533
Oh, Kahn, good to see you.

04:43.616 --> 04:46.160
We're on our way
to distribute food to the poor.

04:46.244 --> 04:48.204
Is that euphemism
for playing round of golf?

04:48.288 --> 04:49.122
Because I'm in.

04:50.039 --> 04:53.376
Kahn, you do know that it's
Makha Bousa today, don't you?

04:55.003 --> 04:57.755
It is one of our most sacred holidays.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.174
Oh, right. I guess it slip my mind.

05:00.258 --> 05:03.928
Ah. But only momentarily,
because tonight Minh and I throw

05:04.012 --> 05:06.347
Makha Bousa celebration dinner
at our house.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.308
I insist that you both join us.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.518
Well, that would be super. I accept.

05:10.601 --> 05:11.519
Really?

05:11.602 --> 05:13.604
Oh, okay then, I see you tonight.

05:13.688 --> 05:16.524
Ah. You know, it so nice that lately,

05:16.607 --> 05:20.611
-you and I able to spend more time...
-Kahn, the poor.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.196
Oh, yes, the poor.

05:22.780 --> 05:25.366
I, uh... I hope they get more money soon.

05:27.452 --> 05:28.494
Good morning.

05:28.578 --> 05:31.456
We're here to sign my son up
for a course in CPR.

05:31.539 --> 05:33.207
We're essentially getting a pool.

05:33.791 --> 05:36.294
Well, we have a basic, one day course.

05:36.377 --> 05:37.837
We also have a two-week course

05:37.920 --> 05:40.882
which includes advanced emergency care
for infants and seniors.

05:40.965 --> 05:42.967
-He'll take the two-week course.
-What?

05:43.051 --> 05:44.635
Your grandfather might come to visit,

05:44.719 --> 05:47.722
and I'd like to be able to say
we did everything we could.

05:52.810 --> 05:55.313
Gentlemen, I'd like to make a toast.

05:55.688 --> 05:59.275
To a man whose backyard soil
was of a consistency

05:59.359 --> 06:01.861
which made for hassle-free excavation,

06:01.944 --> 06:04.989
and had no interfering sewage lines.

06:06.491 --> 06:08.743
Hey, Kahn, dinner guests are here.

06:08.826 --> 06:09.744
Already?

06:09.827 --> 06:11.871
Oh, I wanted everything perfect.

06:12.205 --> 06:14.248
Start assembling my pool furniture.

06:18.419 --> 06:20.338
Good evening, Kahn. I hope...

06:21.589 --> 06:24.842
I hope it's all right if I brought
a few of our Laotian friends.

06:24.926 --> 06:25.927
Certainly.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.012
I think we got enough pina coladas.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.681
Magha Puja just starting in backyard.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.651
And ta-da.

06:41.734 --> 06:44.529
Ted, look who is getting a swimming pool.

06:48.032 --> 06:50.410
Yeah, redneck neighbors build it for me.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.955
Maybe next I have them build me railroad.

06:54.038 --> 06:55.123
How that for revenge?

06:55.206 --> 06:58.543
Kahn, the railroads were built
by the Chinese, not Laotians.

06:59.127 --> 06:59.961
Ah, same difference.

07:01.295 --> 07:03.297
It just joke.

07:05.299 --> 07:06.384
Maybe too far?

07:07.844 --> 07:08.928
A word if we may.

07:09.303 --> 07:12.473
Nguc and I feel that you've become
grievously disconnected

07:12.557 --> 07:13.558
from your heritage.

07:13.641 --> 07:14.475
Mm-hmm.

07:14.559 --> 07:17.353
It's as though you've completely forgotten
that you're Lao.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.063
What? Ah, that's not true.

07:19.147 --> 07:20.565
Take a look around, Kahn.

07:28.406 --> 07:31.033
Can you point to one Lao artifact
in your home?

07:31.117 --> 07:34.912
Can you recall the last conversation
you had that was not in English?

07:34.996 --> 07:36.539
In our homeland,

07:36.622 --> 07:39.876
the Lao man is oppressed
by his government.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.627
But inside of you,

07:41.711 --> 07:45.006
the Lao man is oppressed by himself.

07:45.089 --> 07:48.384
You destroy your own ethnic identity.

07:48.468 --> 07:51.762
It is sterilized in the chlorinated waters

07:51.846 --> 07:53.764
-of your swimming pool.
-Oh.

07:53.848 --> 07:56.100
You've become what is known as a "banana."

07:56.184 --> 07:57.059
"Banana"?

07:57.143 --> 07:59.937
Consider the properties of a banana, Kahn.

08:00.021 --> 08:04.025
Its skin is yellow,
but its insides are white.

08:04.108 --> 08:04.942
Uh, but...

08:06.986 --> 08:08.196
But I'm not white.

08:08.279 --> 08:10.823
Okay, everyone. Steak's on.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.117
Who need ketchup?

08:19.582 --> 08:21.292
They call me "banana," Minh.

08:21.375 --> 08:23.628
-That crazy, right?
-Of course.

08:23.711 --> 08:25.588
You very Asian. Very Lao.

08:25.671 --> 08:28.841
But Ted say there no visible evidence
of my heritage.

08:32.887 --> 08:34.263
<i>People Magazine.</i>

08:34.347 --> 08:37.141
Didn't we have a subscription
to Xaignabouri Muang Weekly?

08:37.225 --> 08:39.143
Well, I guess it must have run out.

08:39.227 --> 08:42.897
There not one stinking trace
of our homeland in this place.

08:42.980 --> 08:44.690
If stranger walk in here, he says,

08:44.774 --> 08:50.446
"Ah, this must be where Johnny Smith live,
not Kahn Souf... Kahn Stouff..."

08:50.530 --> 08:52.907
Oh, my God. I cannot say my own name.

08:52.990 --> 08:56.410
Oh, calm down now.
You can still say your own name.

08:56.494 --> 08:58.204
You just freaking out right now.

08:58.287 --> 09:01.457
You spoke perfect Lao
to your own mother just last week.

09:01.749 --> 09:03.960
<i>Sa-baai-dee, luuk-saao</i><i>tee naa-hak.</i>

09:04.043 --> 09:05.169
<i>Bpen-jang ci ai?</i>

09:05.670 --> 09:08.464
Wait, are, are you saying good night,
or are you cursing at me?

09:08.548 --> 09:09.924
You see?

09:10.174 --> 09:11.926
Connie can't even speak Lao.

09:12.009 --> 09:13.678
That is messed up, Minh.

09:13.761 --> 09:16.389
Mm... Maybe you're right.

09:16.472 --> 09:19.267
We could connect
a little more to our heritage.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.769
Yes... that an excellent plan.

09:21.936 --> 09:25.481
Connie, you remember the gong we hit
during <i>American Idol?</i>

09:26.148 --> 09:28.359
Let me show you what it's really for.

09:34.115 --> 09:36.742
Hmm, these weeds weren't here yesterday.

09:36.826 --> 09:39.203
Hands off, redneck. That's my celery.

09:40.121 --> 09:41.872
The Lao people are self-sufficient.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.624
We grow our own food.

09:43.708 --> 09:48.838
We not rely on big supermarket to nurse us
like helpless calf at mother's teat.

09:51.924 --> 09:53.259
Well...

09:53.342 --> 09:54.218
Okay then.

09:54.760 --> 09:55.845
We're gonna swim now.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.180
Have fun, hopeless Americans.

09:58.264 --> 10:02.018
Enjoy splashing around in your river
that leads to nowhere.

10:06.105 --> 10:09.025
Yeah, it great to be back in touch
with my roots.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.360
Minh buy beautiful piece by Lao artist.

10:11.444 --> 10:13.571
Painting of people
toiling in rice paddies.

10:14.822 --> 10:17.283
It's great to support Lao culture, Kahn,

10:17.366 --> 10:20.745
but your home is still a shrine
to American material luxury.

10:21.495 --> 10:23.039
I guess I little confused.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.582
I cannot help but notice

10:24.665 --> 10:26.792
your state-of-the-art home theater system,

10:26.876 --> 10:28.169
and your four-car garage.

10:28.252 --> 10:31.547
Sure, I own all of these things,

10:31.797 --> 10:33.215
but they don't own me.

10:33.299 --> 10:35.635
I'll try to explain.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.387
This is Man of Louang Namtha,

10:38.471 --> 10:42.016
carved by a native highlander
more than 300 years ago.

10:42.099 --> 10:44.352
It's the embodiment of the Lao spirit.

10:44.894 --> 10:47.146
This is my link.

10:47.563 --> 10:49.106
As long as I carry this,

10:49.190 --> 10:51.692
everything else is meaningless.

10:51.776 --> 10:55.571
So I just keep one of those in my pocket
and I can have big screen TV?

10:55.863 --> 10:58.074
You got an extra one
of those guys lying around?

10:58.157 --> 11:00.326
Unfortunately, you're not ready yet.

11:00.409 --> 11:02.953
It wouldn't mean to you
what it means to me.

11:08.376 --> 11:09.752
So, what for dinner?

11:09.835 --> 11:11.003
Is that a joke?

11:11.087 --> 11:13.297
You know damn well it's rice and meat.

11:13.381 --> 11:14.715
Oh, of course.

11:14.965 --> 11:17.968
I get so used to American diet
of extreme variety.

11:19.762 --> 11:21.514
Yeah. This better.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.268
Yay! I won.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.646
Can you throw it... Throw it here.

11:30.064 --> 11:33.067
I will now tell stories
of my childhood in Laos.

11:33.442 --> 11:36.612
Growing up in the village,
I had two chickens.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.364
One of them was named Phouma.

11:38.447 --> 11:39.365
Marco.

11:39.448 --> 11:41.701
Polo.

11:43.744 --> 11:45.454
I don't recall the name
of the other chicken,

11:45.538 --> 11:47.915
but, sometimes,
I would put both of the chickens

11:47.998 --> 11:49.166
in the wheelbarrow.

11:49.792 --> 11:50.793
This was very funny.

11:50.876 --> 11:53.045
I'm a submarine.

11:53.129 --> 11:54.797
Don't splash me.

11:58.926 --> 12:00.594
Mm-hmm.

12:01.053 --> 12:04.974
You know, sometimes I think
I'd like to visit Indiana.

12:05.349 --> 12:06.475
Is that weird?

12:06.726 --> 12:09.395
Hey, man, you know, dang ol' go
with that feeling, man.

12:09.478 --> 12:12.356
-I think that's a great dream, Hank.
-Thank you.

12:13.691 --> 12:15.818
Boy, Kahn's in there right now,

12:15.901 --> 12:18.320
beating himself up for God knows why,

12:18.404 --> 12:20.865
when he could be out here
floating under the stars.

12:20.948 --> 12:22.116
It's wild.

12:22.199 --> 12:24.577
Ten yards away, a man suffers,

12:24.660 --> 12:28.164
but I'm still completely able
to enjoy his pool.

12:29.123 --> 12:31.292
I guess I'm just growing up.

12:36.297 --> 12:39.884
Would it shame our entire people
if I sit on chair?

12:39.967 --> 12:41.218
This not about comfort.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.763
This is about being true to who we are.

12:43.846 --> 12:46.348
It about never being
called "banana" again.

12:47.349 --> 12:50.144
What we need is to focus harder.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.195
<i>♪ I'll be there for you ♪</i>

12:59.779 --> 13:01.238
Look who passed.

13:01.822 --> 13:02.782
Way to go, Bobby.

13:02.865 --> 13:04.533
-Yay!
-Congratulations, man.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.368
Let's hit the pool.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.581
Oh, God!

13:14.585 --> 13:15.961
Kahn, what the hell

13:16.045 --> 13:17.713
did you do to our swimming pool?

13:17.797 --> 13:20.132
It now reflecting pool.

13:20.216 --> 13:23.427
We need peaceful space
in which we can meditate.

13:23.511 --> 13:24.970
We had a deal.

13:25.054 --> 13:26.847
Oh, you had deal with old Kahn.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.642
The homogenized, Americanized Kahn.

13:29.725 --> 13:31.727
That Kahn no longer exist.

13:31.811 --> 13:33.229
And neither does pool.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.898
I learned CPR for nothing?

13:35.981 --> 13:38.943
I went to school on a Saturday.

13:39.527 --> 13:40.486
So help me,

13:40.569 --> 13:43.906
the only thing keeping me
from wishing a pox on your house

13:43.989 --> 13:45.825
is that your house is next to my house,

13:45.908 --> 13:47.409
and the pox could spread.

13:51.580 --> 13:55.709
And Connie finally getting used to eating
fermented fish chunks and rice husks.

13:55.793 --> 13:58.379
So how does it feel, Kahn,
to rediscover your roots?

13:58.462 --> 14:01.340
Uh, well... it not always fun.

14:01.799 --> 14:05.177
But as I recall,
life in Laos not always so fun.

14:05.427 --> 14:07.179
So I guess I'm on right track, right?

14:07.263 --> 14:08.848
-Wrong.
-Oh, dear.

14:08.931 --> 14:12.810
Kahn, right now the Lao community
is not taken seriously.

14:12.893 --> 14:16.772
The Cuban exile community in Florida
is taken very seriously.

14:16.856 --> 14:17.815
Do you know why?

14:18.399 --> 14:20.651
Uh... Gloria Estefan?

14:20.734 --> 14:24.029
No. They wield political influence
in this country

14:24.113 --> 14:26.740
while maintaining ties to rebel groups
in their mother country.

14:26.824 --> 14:28.951
In the mountains of our homeland,

14:29.034 --> 14:32.246
there is still a small
but determined movement,

14:32.329 --> 14:34.748
a resistance to the communist regime.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.292
Imagine it, Kahn,

14:36.375 --> 14:38.752
a free and independent Laos.

14:38.836 --> 14:40.546
Yeah, that sound great.

14:40.921 --> 14:43.716
With men like Ted Wassanasong
leading the way,

14:43.841 --> 14:46.594
-the dream can become real.
-Yes.

14:46.677 --> 14:50.097
But an undertaking like this
can only work with total commitment.

14:50.180 --> 14:51.765
Oh, I'd be happy to write a check.

14:51.849 --> 14:54.643
No, Kahn, we want you
to join the armed resistance

14:54.768 --> 14:56.979
and fight for us on the front lines.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.188
Front lines?

14:58.272 --> 15:00.774
Oh, yes, Kahn, there may be risks,
but I wonder,

15:00.858 --> 15:04.695
is life as a banana better than death
or is it worse?

15:06.614 --> 15:07.865
Will you join us, Kahn?

15:08.490 --> 15:10.451
Of course, he will join us.

15:10.826 --> 15:12.286
He is a proud Lao man,

15:12.536 --> 15:15.581
willing to shed his blood
for our mother country.

15:20.794 --> 15:22.671
Uh...

15:27.384 --> 15:28.844
This crazy.

15:28.928 --> 15:32.181
For first time, I feel pride,
I feel like true Laotian.

15:32.264 --> 15:33.557
And you say it crazy.

15:33.641 --> 15:36.352
I'm saying that in matter of days,

15:36.435 --> 15:38.896
you chuck all the furniture
and pick up machine gun.

15:38.979 --> 15:40.898
Maybe it time to take stock.

15:40.981 --> 15:42.399
You know what I think?

15:42.483 --> 15:44.735
I think you starting to sound
a lot like...

15:47.321 --> 15:48.489
a banana.

15:49.073 --> 15:49.907
Kahn,

15:49.990 --> 15:52.159
-that's ridiculous.
-No time to argue.

15:52.242 --> 15:53.077
I have training,

15:53.160 --> 15:55.996
then I supposed to build sandbag fortress
around Ted's house.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.374
Connie.

15:58.457 --> 16:00.250
You can stop hulling rice.

16:00.334 --> 16:01.835
We're going to Whattaburger.

16:15.099 --> 16:16.642
Nice shot, Tom.

16:18.602 --> 16:20.688
Hmm.

16:20.771 --> 16:21.855
<i>Sa-dang aa-wut.</i>

16:22.690 --> 16:23.691
Oh!

16:24.358 --> 16:25.192
Nguc.

16:25.275 --> 16:27.319
You are a disgrace.

16:27.403 --> 16:30.030
You won't survive five minutes in combat.

16:30.614 --> 16:32.950
Especially you.

16:34.952 --> 16:36.078
I can't have this.

16:36.161 --> 16:37.621
I talked councilmen Ebberd

16:37.705 --> 16:40.499
into making the first Tuesday
in May "Lao Freedom Day."

16:40.582 --> 16:43.794
We are parading from the nail salon
to the boba tea shop,

16:43.877 --> 16:46.213
and we are going to look smart doing it.

16:59.268 --> 17:00.227
Yep.

17:00.602 --> 17:01.520
Yep.

17:02.062 --> 17:03.981
What happened to your face, Kahn?

17:04.064 --> 17:07.067
Finally steal a pool from someone
who knows how to fight?

17:07.151 --> 17:09.319
No. It training accident.

17:09.403 --> 17:11.405
I take butt of rifle to the face.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.991
Hah. What poetic justice.

17:14.074 --> 17:17.703
You steal a pool
and then the butt of a rifle...

17:18.454 --> 17:22.166
steals the... health of your face.

17:22.249 --> 17:24.043
Hey, you treat me with respect.

17:24.126 --> 17:27.171
I happen to be colonel
in Ted Wassanasong's army.

17:27.254 --> 17:30.466
Uh, yeah, I still don't really get
what that is.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.801
I just want the got-danged pool back.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.471
So clean it up, and then,
you can spend the rest of your life

17:35.554 --> 17:38.807
running around like a jackass
with Ted Wassanasong.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.184
Run around like jackass?

17:40.267 --> 17:41.852
Hah. Shows what you know.

17:41.935 --> 17:45.481
At any moment, Ted could call me,
say code word "Siddhartha",

17:45.564 --> 17:49.318
and then it not just running around
like jackass anymore, buddy-boy.

17:49.401 --> 17:52.529
Uh-huh. And what happens
when Ted says "Siddhartha"?

17:52.613 --> 17:55.240
Well, we get on cargo plane
and fly to Laos.

17:55.324 --> 17:58.285
If we are not blown apart
by anti-aircraft fire,

17:58.368 --> 18:00.162
we parachute into mountains.

18:00.245 --> 18:03.665
If we not shot on way down,
or die on impact,

18:03.916 --> 18:05.876
we march into capital.

18:06.418 --> 18:07.336
And then...

18:07.920 --> 18:08.879
well...

18:08.962 --> 18:11.673
we probably all be shot
or run over with tank.

18:12.007 --> 18:14.426
Uh, some of us may get taken prisoner.

18:14.760 --> 18:18.889
And then most likely they torture us
or reeducate us, and then...

18:19.765 --> 18:21.391
put us in their army.

18:22.184 --> 18:23.268
Huh.

18:27.648 --> 18:31.276
Anyone else notice
he cuts a pretty nice figure in uniform?

18:40.410 --> 18:41.578
<i>When Ellen returns,</i>

18:41.662 --> 18:44.665
<i>she's making fajitas
with Justin Timberlake.</i>

18:44.748 --> 18:46.750
Don't start, Kahn. I'm not turning it off.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.252
Who were her guests?

18:48.335 --> 18:50.295
Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson.

18:50.379 --> 18:51.505
What were they plugging?

18:51.588 --> 18:53.632
-Fitness tape.
-Mm.

18:53.715 --> 18:57.427
When I was a banana,
I would have eaten that up with a spoon.

18:57.511 --> 19:00.347
You know, I'm getting sick
and tired of that word.

19:00.430 --> 19:01.974
You and me both.

19:02.057 --> 19:05.435
I don't know what's worse,
being sent on suicide mission in Laos

19:05.519 --> 19:07.604
or having Ted Wassanasong tell me,

19:07.688 --> 19:11.024
"I'm sorry, Kahn,
but your salute is not crisp enough."

19:11.650 --> 19:15.445
Why you let Ted Wassanasong
tell you what to do,

19:15.529 --> 19:17.364
what to like, what to think?

19:17.447 --> 19:20.242
Isn't that why we fled
the communists in Laos?

19:20.325 --> 19:23.120
And the homeowners' association
in Orange County?

19:23.203 --> 19:24.454
Well, yeah, but...

19:24.538 --> 19:28.417
Kahn, don't you want to hear
beautiful strains of Brahms

19:28.500 --> 19:30.210
come off Connie's violin?

19:30.294 --> 19:32.838
To eat yourself silly on baby back ribs

19:32.921 --> 19:36.091
and then, fall backwards
in your sparkling swimming pool

19:36.175 --> 19:38.719
like those iced tea ads you love so much?

19:47.728 --> 19:48.937
Hey, Ted.

19:49.021 --> 19:51.356
I want to thank you for making me remember

19:51.440 --> 19:53.275
who I am and where I come from,

19:53.358 --> 19:55.402
but I won't be needing these anymore.

19:55.986 --> 19:56.945
I don't understand.

19:57.029 --> 19:59.239
How do you plan to parade
without your uniform?

19:59.323 --> 20:01.408
Oh, my parading days are done.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.078
It's like this.

20:05.162 --> 20:08.415
If you want someone to play
a round of golf, give me call.

20:08.498 --> 20:11.877
If you want someone to feel guilty
about the way they choose to live,

20:11.960 --> 20:13.420
call someone else.

20:15.631 --> 20:16.757

20:38.195 --> 20:39.821
bulldoze your home,

20:39.905 --> 20:42.282

20:42.366 --> 20:44.368
Well, that's a dream, I guess.

20:44.993 --> 20:45.869
