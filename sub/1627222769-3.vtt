00:22.000 --> 00:24.333
[grunting]

00:26.208 --> 00:27.666
What took you so long?

00:36.166 --> 00:37.458
[both grunting]

00:46.708 --> 00:47.625
Jason?

00:47.708 --> 00:49.166
I got a new name now, though.

00:50.041 --> 00:51.208
Red Hood.

00:53.333 --> 00:54.708
[panting]

00:59.750 --> 01:00.875
Oh, no.

01:08.708 --> 01:10.791
[theme music playing]

01:28.416 --> 01:29.875
There was a dead body.

01:29.958 --> 01:32.291
Jason's body.
Bruce saw it
with his own eyes.

01:32.375 --> 01:34.708
Maybe he was confused.

01:34.791 --> 01:36.125
Bruce doesn't do confused.

01:36.208 --> 01:37.500
-I don't want to say it, but--
-It was Jason.

01:37.583 --> 01:38.583
I saw him.

01:41.166 --> 01:42.750
How did he do it?

01:42.833 --> 01:45.333
Somebody do some kind of
voodoo act and raise him
from the dead?

01:45.416 --> 01:46.625
Bruce knows people.

01:46.708 --> 01:48.500
Bruce doesn't
know anything about this.

01:48.583 --> 01:50.333
He never would
have killed the Joker
if Jason was alive.

01:50.416 --> 01:51.750
Then Ra's al Ghul?

01:51.833 --> 01:53.791
Unlikely. He's in Kadeem.

01:53.875 --> 01:57.583
If someone's bringing people
back to life, maybe they could
bring Donna back.

02:03.375 --> 02:07.041
Well, it's a little early for
Easter, but someone resurrected
the little assbite.

02:07.125 --> 02:10.208
Or he faked his death
well enough to fool even Bruce.

02:10.291 --> 02:13.000
Either way, he sure as shit
didn't do it on his own.

02:13.083 --> 02:14.875
Whatever's happened,
he's changed.

02:14.958 --> 02:18.708
The kid always had issues,
but he was not a full on
psychopath.

02:18.791 --> 02:20.541
He could be using.

02:20.625 --> 02:23.000
When I got to Gotham,
I found a place
where he was cooking.

02:23.083 --> 02:24.958
Tested a few samples
in the bat computer.

02:25.041 --> 02:26.458
No hits.

02:26.541 --> 02:29.583
For fuck's sake. Enough with
the paralysis by analysis.

02:29.666 --> 02:32.291
Everyone's just trying to
figure out what the hell
happened, Hank.

02:32.375 --> 02:34.625
He's right. We figure out
the how and why later.

02:34.708 --> 02:36.416
Jason's out there
and we need to stop him.

02:36.500 --> 02:39.500
You guys do what you want,
but if it ends up
him versus me,

02:39.583 --> 02:40.750
kid's going down.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.500
So, now we're killing Jason?

02:46.666 --> 02:47.916
He wrote his own ticket.

02:49.000 --> 02:51.125
He starts taking people out,

02:51.208 --> 02:52.166
game's over.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.791
Look, we find him first.
Start in the place
he was cooking.

03:10.500 --> 03:11.458
What are you doing?

03:12.583 --> 03:13.541
Fueling up.

03:15.833 --> 03:17.666
Could be a long day.

03:17.750 --> 03:19.625
You need to give everybody
a minute to get their heads
around this.

03:19.708 --> 03:22.541
We all thought Jason was dead,
and now we're talking about him

03:22.625 --> 03:24.625
like he's some
Gotham supervillain.

03:24.708 --> 03:27.666
I think you mean
supervillain wanna be.

03:27.750 --> 03:29.875
You keep forgetting,
this is Jason
we're talking about.

03:29.958 --> 03:31.791
It makes it complicated
for everybody.

03:31.875 --> 03:34.666
We need to forget he's Jason.

03:34.750 --> 03:36.416
Put blinders on.

03:36.500 --> 03:39.541
Otherwise, people get soft
and someone gets hurt.

03:39.625 --> 03:41.083
No one's getting soft.

03:41.166 --> 03:43.208
Dick's just trying to do
what Bruce wants.

03:43.291 --> 03:44.291
Why?

03:44.375 --> 03:45.916
Because Jason's his brother?

03:46.000 --> 03:47.875
-Yes.
-Well, he's not mine.

03:47.958 --> 03:49.416
Give me ten seconds
alone with that kid,

03:49.500 --> 03:51.416
I'll make him wish
he stayed dead.

03:54.083 --> 03:56.458
Just dial it down
a notch, okay?

03:56.541 --> 03:58.250
Everybody here
knows what they need to do.

04:01.208 --> 04:02.500
What about you?

04:02.583 --> 04:03.541
What about me?

04:04.666 --> 04:05.958
Are you up to it?

04:07.666 --> 04:09.041
You know the answer to that.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.666
[cell phone ringing]

04:15.708 --> 04:16.708
Yeah.

04:19.125 --> 04:21.375
I know, I fucked up.

04:21.458 --> 04:22.916
Please, you gotta help me out.

04:24.041 --> 04:25.208
Jason?

04:26.833 --> 04:28.166
Hey, you there?

04:28.250 --> 04:30.666
I shouldn't have called you.

04:30.750 --> 04:32.875
-Is anybody else with you?
-No.

04:33.625 --> 04:34.583
It's just me.

04:35.708 --> 04:36.958
Talk to me, pal.

04:37.041 --> 04:38.250
Hank...

04:38.333 --> 04:40.458
You've got to believe me, man.
Okay?

04:40.541 --> 04:41.916
<i>All of this shit I've done,</i>

04:42.000 --> 04:43.250
<i>it's not my fault.</i>

04:43.333 --> 04:44.500
I don't know
what's happening to me.

04:44.583 --> 04:45.750
Something's wrong with me.

04:48.916 --> 04:49.958
Where are you?

04:50.041 --> 04:51.833
I can't tell you.

04:51.916 --> 04:55.083
Dick will kill me.
I just... I wanted to
talk to somebody.

04:55.166 --> 04:58.000
<i>And you're the only one</i>
<i>who ever tries to listen to me.</i>

04:58.083 --> 05:00.166
Fuck, this was a mistake.
I gotta go.

05:00.250 --> 05:02.000
No, no, no.
Jason! Jason, wait.

05:03.125 --> 05:04.208
I can help you.

05:05.125 --> 05:08.166
Just tell me where you are.

05:08.250 --> 05:09.375
And you'll tell Dick.

05:09.458 --> 05:10.666
<i>No, I won't.</i>

05:13.125 --> 05:14.750
It's just you and me.

<i>Good morning, Mr. Logan.</i>

05:22.666 --> 05:23.708
<i>How can I help you?</i>

05:23.791 --> 05:25.208
Send message to Bruce Wayne.

05:25.291 --> 05:26.500
<i>No contact found.</i>

05:26.583 --> 05:28.875
-Bullshit.
<i>-Language, Mr. Logan.</i>

05:28.958 --> 05:30.583
Would you prefer French?

05:30.666 --> 05:34.083
-Record audio message.
<i>-Ready to record.</i>

05:34.166 --> 05:37.583
Hey, Bruce, this is Gar.

05:37.666 --> 05:39.333
I know you've got to be
checking in from somewhere,

05:39.416 --> 05:42.791
because Batman wouldn't
abandon the only family he has.

05:45.541 --> 05:47.375
You've got to come back
to Gotham, man.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.625
They're saying Jason's alive.

05:51.500 --> 05:52.875
He needs your help.

05:54.458 --> 05:55.708
We need your help.

05:57.166 --> 05:59.041
[Conner] You really think he is
going to hear that?

06:01.500 --> 06:05.000
Between sipping martinis,
I figure he's got time.

06:05.083 --> 06:09.500
Just under 48 hours ago,
we were kicking ass
in San Francisco.

06:09.583 --> 06:11.291
Now the whole world
has turned upside down.

06:13.166 --> 06:15.000
I don't understand it, either.

06:15.083 --> 06:18.125
But if Jason's alive,
killing innocent people...

06:18.958 --> 06:20.500
we have to stop him.

06:20.583 --> 06:22.458
That's what Titans do.

06:22.541 --> 06:25.416
Yeah, but, normally
when we do it, we're not
hunting down one of our own.

06:33.958 --> 06:37.041
Hey, are we going anywhere,
or you are just seeing
the sights?

06:37.125 --> 06:39.416
I'll let you know,
just keep driving.

06:41.625 --> 06:44.416
Come on, you little shit.
Don't bail on me now.

-I thought I lost you.

06:52.541 --> 06:53.958
Are you okay?

06:54.041 --> 06:56.166
Uh, no, not really.

06:57.625 --> 06:59.125
Are you alone?

06:59.208 --> 07:00.708
Just me and, uh...

-Who is that?
-Cabdriver, relax. [chuckles]

07:10.041 --> 07:12.500
So, where are we going?

07:12.583 --> 07:14.541
Go to the
old Gotham Observatory.

07:14.625 --> 07:16.708
Gotham Observatory.

07:16.791 --> 07:18.166

Okay, I'm here.

<i>be tracked.</i>
<i>You gotta destroy it.</i>

<i>I'm sorry, man.</i>

It's not you I don't trust.
Dick's a fucking psycho.

07:41.458 --> 07:42.916
He could be following you
right now.

07:44.916 --> 07:46.416
Destroy it, and then what?

07:47.250 --> 07:48.458
[line disconnects]

07:56.125 --> 07:57.416
[cell phone ringing]

08:12.458 --> 08:14.791
There better be a chalupa
at the end of this.

08:14.875 --> 08:16.625
Gotham City Gym.

08:16.708 --> 08:18.208
[driver] Are you sure?
Board of Health closed it down
last month.

08:18.291 --> 08:19.250
[Hank] Just go!

[Hank] Jason?

08:36.625 --> 08:37.750
[rats squeak]

08:41.000 --> 08:41.916
Awesome.

08:43.375 --> 08:44.791
[cell phone ringing]

08:46.500 --> 08:48.000
I'm here.

08:48.083 --> 08:49.916
Where are you?

08:50.000 --> 08:52.375
[Jason]<i> Take off</i>
<i>your shirt and pants</i>
<i>to prove you're not wired.</i>

08:52.458 --> 08:53.750
Come on. Really?

08:57.166 --> 08:58.125
Okay.

08:59.666 --> 09:00.666
Okay.

09:14.708 --> 09:15.625
[sighing]

09:19.791 --> 09:21.125
What next?

09:21.208 --> 09:22.166
<i>Full Monty?</i>

09:23.250 --> 09:24.250
[Jason]<i> You said it.</i>

09:28.791 --> 09:30.458
Remember, I work for tips.

09:39.291 --> 09:40.625
Happy now?

09:40.708 --> 09:43.250
See? No wires.

09:44.375 --> 09:45.541
Start talking about a glove,

09:45.625 --> 09:47.333
it's gonna cost extra.

09:47.416 --> 09:49.541
[Jason]<i> You gotta swim</i>
<i>to the other end.</i>

09:49.625 --> 09:51.166
In this shit?

09:51.250 --> 09:53.458
You think I got a tracker on
under my junk?

09:53.541 --> 09:55.250
<i>If you can't do it,</i>
<i>neither can I.</i>

10:01.583 --> 10:02.541
You're welcome.

10:14.041 --> 10:15.750
All right. No more games.

10:17.375 --> 10:18.500
I'm here.

10:19.291 --> 10:20.541
[grunts]

10:20.625 --> 10:22.041
Good to see you, Hank.

10:27.333 --> 10:29.208
Where the hell did he go?

10:29.291 --> 10:31.791
Couple minutes later,
he leaves,
gets in a cab.

10:33.125 --> 10:34.916
Now his phone is
off the grid.

10:39.708 --> 10:41.125
Can you pull the plate?

10:41.208 --> 10:42.125
I'll try.

10:43.916 --> 10:46.458
[Dawn]
We talked in the kitchen.
Everything was fine.

10:46.541 --> 10:48.166
I told him to dial it
down a notch.

10:48.250 --> 10:49.666
-Present and accounted for.
-What?

10:52.791 --> 10:53.833
[Dawn] Hank!

10:55.125 --> 10:56.083
What happened?

10:58.500 --> 11:00.041
Just get it out of me.

11:00.125 --> 11:01.541
Oh, my God.

11:01.625 --> 11:02.875
Is that a bomb?

11:03.666 --> 11:05.375
It's a gift.

11:05.458 --> 11:06.875
From our pal Jason.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.708
Oh, good.
You found him.

11:13.083 --> 11:14.208
Or not?

11:16.000 --> 11:18.250
Went to talk to Jason
by yourself?

11:18.333 --> 11:20.416
Seemed like a good idea
at the time.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.666
Just give me a shot of whiskey
and get the damn thing out.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.000
I'm all for
not touching that thing

11:24.083 --> 11:25.875
until we figure out
how it works.

11:25.958 --> 11:27.875
Conner, take a look inside
and tell us
what we're dealing with.

11:27.958 --> 11:28.875
Yeah.

11:30.625 --> 11:31.666
[heart beating]

11:32.416 --> 11:33.250
Whoa.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.250
This is pretty bitching.

11:35.333 --> 11:37.208
[Dawn] Conner!

11:37.291 --> 11:40.500
[clears throat] It has
anti-retraction barbs that
hold the device in place.

11:40.583 --> 11:43.291
Looks like it's embedded in
the pectoralis major,

11:43.375 --> 11:45.541
right through to
the aortic arch.

11:45.625 --> 11:47.250
No part of that
sounded good.

11:47.333 --> 11:49.416
The engineering is
incredibly nuanced.

11:52.000 --> 11:55.500
Bomb's designed to tolerate
insertion, not retraction.

11:57.166 --> 12:00.333
These barbs in Hank's chest,
they have sensors.

12:00.416 --> 12:02.958
If those sensors detect
too much force, it'll explode.

12:03.041 --> 12:04.625
What if
we remove it surgically?

12:04.708 --> 12:07.333
Same outcome. Once activated,
it's designed to kill.

12:09.625 --> 12:11.083
That fucking little shit.

12:11.166 --> 12:14.875
This whole thing's engineered
to read EKG signals.

12:14.958 --> 12:18.625
The countdown isn't seconds.
It's the number of heartbeats
he has left.

12:18.708 --> 12:19.708
What do you mean "countdown"?

12:26.291 --> 12:27.625
When it gets down to zero.

12:27.708 --> 12:29.500
Jason can't actually
want him to die, right?

12:31.625 --> 12:32.833
[cell phone ringing]

12:32.916 --> 12:34.625
I have a feeling
we're about to find out.

12:38.208 --> 12:39.416
I'm listening.

12:39.500 --> 12:40.500
[Jason]<i> About time.</i>

12:41.625 --> 12:43.166
How's my buddy, Hank?

12:43.250 --> 12:45.083
Whatever you want,
killing Hank is
no way to get it.

12:45.166 --> 12:46.833
[Jason]<i> Still trying to</i>
<i>tell me what to do?</i>

12:46.916 --> 12:47.958
Enough with the games.

12:48.750 --> 12:49.708
Tell me how we end this.

12:49.791 --> 12:51.416
$50 million
in gold bars

12:51.500 --> 12:54.500
is being delivered
at one o'clock
to Gotham Central.

12:54.583 --> 12:57.083
If you want Hank old boy
to stay in one piece,

12:57.166 --> 12:58.208
bring 'em to me.

12:58.291 --> 13:00.000
This isn't about
the money for you.

13:00.083 --> 13:02.208
I could wire that right now
and it would all be over.

13:02.291 --> 13:04.875
And rob Gotham of a good show,
Circus Boy?

13:06.333 --> 13:09.000
Bring me the gold
and I'll deactivate
the device.

13:09.083 --> 13:10.291
Never gonna happen.

13:10.375 --> 13:11.958
<i>Do it your way, Dick.</i>

13:12.041 --> 13:13.833
That always turns out well.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.166
Gold bars?

13:18.250 --> 13:20.083
Did he have a white cat
on his lap, too?

13:20.166 --> 13:21.250
What did you tell him?

13:21.333 --> 13:22.958
Fucking N-O, I hope?

13:23.041 --> 13:24.791
No way we negotiate
with terrorists.

13:24.875 --> 13:26.875
So we're just gonna
call his bluff?

13:26.958 --> 13:28.208
Jason's crazy.

13:28.291 --> 13:30.833
Where I come from,
you come after family,

13:30.916 --> 13:32.500
we show no mercy.

13:33.625 --> 13:35.291
How much time
do we have left?

13:35.375 --> 13:37.458
The average
resting heart rate is
80 beats per minute.

13:37.541 --> 13:41.208
-Well, mine's a little
closer to 72.
-4300 beats per hour, that's...

13:41.291 --> 13:42.708
Less than four hours.

13:45.708 --> 13:47.375
All right, get him on
a beta blocker drip.

13:47.458 --> 13:49.250
It'll slow down his heart rate
and buy us some more time.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.333
Hey.

13:56.833 --> 13:59.208
You're not seriously
letting Hank call the shots?

13:59.291 --> 14:01.208
That's not the plan.
We find Jason.

14:01.291 --> 14:03.708
-How?
-The building where he was
cooking was torched last night.

14:03.791 --> 14:05.583
So, he is covering his tracks.

14:05.666 --> 14:08.625
I'll send Kory to GCPD,
see what leads Barbara's got.

14:08.708 --> 14:10.583
[scoffs]

14:10.666 --> 14:12.541
And if she doesn't roll out
the red carpet after
last night, what's plan B?

14:12.625 --> 14:15.208
We focus on reeling
Jason back in.

14:15.291 --> 14:16.458
We play our game,
not his.

14:16.541 --> 14:19.041
Our game is to save Hank,
not Jason.

14:19.125 --> 14:20.375
It's not one or the other.

14:24.208 --> 14:25.833
Let's just keep
our priorities straight.

14:56.041 --> 14:57.458
I took my eye off the ball.

14:59.375 --> 15:01.041
I knew he was
screwing with me.

15:02.750 --> 15:03.750
It wasn't your fault.

15:05.166 --> 15:06.291
[EKG machine beeping steadily]

15:09.208 --> 15:10.166
I should have had him!

15:10.250 --> 15:11.666
[EKG machine beeping rapidly]

15:11.750 --> 15:14.333
Hank, stop. You're making
your heart beat faster.

15:23.875 --> 15:25.083
What's this?

15:25.166 --> 15:27.333
It's a carotid massage.

15:27.416 --> 15:29.750
Someone's gotta keep
your heart rate down.

15:31.416 --> 15:33.000
[beeping steadily]

15:33.083 --> 15:35.916
You just want an excuse
to get into bed with me.

15:36.000 --> 15:38.125
Stop planning your next orgy
and relax.

15:39.750 --> 15:41.541
Who says an orgy
is not relaxing?

15:41.625 --> 15:42.500
[barks]

15:42.583 --> 15:43.750
Don't encourage him.

It's good shit, or so I'm told.

16:11.833 --> 16:14.916
I don't think your guy's
working alone,
someone's got his ear.

16:15.000 --> 16:16.708
I need a profile.

16:16.791 --> 16:18.708
What makes you so sure
he's not capable
of doing it all on his own?

16:18.791 --> 16:20.875
He's a follower,
drawn to brighter lights.

16:20.958 --> 16:22.541
Maybe he's looking
for a father figure.

16:22.625 --> 16:24.916
-Sure.
-To fill the void.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.916
You know,
a daddy that flew the coop?

16:27.000 --> 16:29.583
Or to replace a daddy
he's rebelling against.

Ooh! Oh, I like that.
That's very good.

It's the old, uh,
mentor/patricide combo.

16:37.375 --> 16:38.791
[Dick] Got some criminal
father figure

16:38.875 --> 16:40.250
or someone who likes
a grand gesture?

16:40.333 --> 16:42.375
[scoffs] Huh.

16:43.041 --> 16:44.583
Yeah.

16:44.666 --> 16:47.333
I'd say, uh...
I'd say the Joker, you know,

16:47.416 --> 16:50.916
but, uh,
the bat snuffed that out.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.625
I don't know, I'm gonna have to
rack my brain on this one.

16:53.708 --> 16:54.916
The search for daddy,

16:55.000 --> 16:57.125
it's going to
affect everything.

16:57.208 --> 16:59.625
-How he fights,
why he fights.
-Meaning?

16:59.708 --> 17:02.791
Meaning that he's in a battle
with his father.

17:02.875 --> 17:05.750
So he's going to use
the weapons of his father.

17:06.833 --> 17:08.750
The abused becomes the abuser.

17:14.791 --> 17:17.125
Hey, Grayson,
where are you going?

17:17.208 --> 17:19.291
You just got here,
buddy old pal.

17:25.125 --> 17:27.041
NSA database, Interpol,

17:27.125 --> 17:29.875
I've searched everywhere
for bomb specs
matching Hank's device,

17:29.958 --> 17:31.291
no hits.

17:31.375 --> 17:33.458
'Cause you're not searching
under Wayne Enterprises.

17:34.875 --> 17:36.833
Bruce is making weapons
to kill people?

On it.

17:45.125 --> 17:47.125
[keyboard clacking]

17:47.208 --> 17:50.625

-Specs are there?
-[Conner] Reading them now.

18:08.166 --> 18:11.458
Wait, to save Hank
we have to go up against
Batman technology?

18:11.541 --> 18:13.291
It's designed to outperform

18:13.375 --> 18:16.000
the military's
most sophisticated
electromagnetic explosives.

18:16.083 --> 18:17.416
Any duplicates on the market,

customer with a deactivator
we can modify?

18:19.708 --> 18:22.416
[exhales]
Hank's was the first prototype.

18:22.500 --> 18:26.000
I need you to build
a deactivator
using these blueprints.

18:26.083 --> 18:28.625
You read through
those schematics faster
than any human ever could,

18:28.708 --> 18:30.416
you can do this.

18:30.500 --> 18:32.916
Wait, reading...
reading is just assimilating
other people's work.

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
You want me
to build something this complex

18:36.083 --> 18:38.208
-in less than three hours?
-Yeah.

18:39.750 --> 18:40.958
[sighs]

18:43.916 --> 18:45.625
-You got this.
-[sighs]

18:46.791 --> 18:48.375
[exhales heavily]

18:55.416 --> 18:57.375
I wanted the Titans
out of Gotham,

18:57.458 --> 19:00.458
but instead I get one
rising from the dead.

19:01.250 --> 19:02.541
My lucky day.

19:02.625 --> 19:04.625
Jason's not a Titan anymore.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.416
And there's no way
he pulled this off on his own.

19:06.500 --> 19:09.041
So we're looking
for the live person

19:09.125 --> 19:12.208
who helped resurrect
the dead person?

19:12.291 --> 19:14.208
I need to see
the morgue security footage

19:14.291 --> 19:17.708
to see if his body
was left unattended.

19:17.791 --> 19:19.500
After what you guys
pulled last night,

19:19.583 --> 19:21.375
I'm not exactly
in a giving mood.

19:22.250 --> 19:24.333
Hank's attached to a bomb,

19:24.416 --> 19:26.125
I'm not asking.

What are you calculating?

I think we can bump you up
to ten milligrams.

19:44.333 --> 19:46.083
[Hank] So how much time
does that buy me?

19:46.166 --> 19:47.416
Twenty minutes?

19:47.500 --> 19:50.583
Maybe more if I watch golf.
[chuckles]

19:50.666 --> 19:52.208
How about something to eat?

19:52.291 --> 19:54.375

you are not cooking it.

at the pearly gates,

20:14.291 --> 20:17.083
I'm gonna tell him
he's got some competition.

-Stop.

20:53.291 --> 20:55.750
Was that a pity kiss
'cause I'm dying?

20:58.083 --> 21:01.250
You're choosing eternity
with Alfred over me?

21:03.583 --> 21:04.916
You wouldn't dare.

21:08.750 --> 21:10.125
Come here.

21:19.791 --> 21:21.875

21:50.583 --> 21:52.250

21:52.333 --> 21:53.583

21:55.125 --> 21:57.375
I screwed everything up.

21:57.458 --> 22:01.458
Yeah, and you're gonna
keep screwing it up.

22:03.625 --> 22:05.416
What if I can't?

do you think it will take?

22:39.000 --> 22:41.958
There are over
1.5 million permutations.

22:47.041 --> 22:50.125

gotta be zero,
or Hank dies.

Tuesday morning...

23:27.583 --> 23:29.708
But he's supposed to be
wheeling the body out back.

23:29.791 --> 23:32.208
That's the door
to the coroner's locker room.

23:32.291 --> 23:35.625
Check the locker room
back exit, side alley.

Maybe when we get to
the other side of this,

23:59.458 --> 24:02.625
you can convince Dick
to move back to San Francisco,

24:02.708 --> 24:05.291
before this city
eats him alive.

You should talk to him.

I go in that room,

to say goodbye.

I can't do it.
I'm not giving up.

-We're not heisting
an armored truck.
-Why?

24:51.333 --> 24:52.541
Because Batman wouldn't?

24:52.625 --> 24:54.291
Because that's exactly
what Jason wants.

24:54.375 --> 24:56.000
It's a game
to make us look like criminals,

24:56.083 --> 24:57.416
to turn Gotham against us.

24:57.500 --> 24:59.000
And you're willing
to let a friend die
