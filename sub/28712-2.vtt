It's really, really striking

00:13.097 --> 00:14.905
when you first see it.

00:14.933 --> 00:17.575
It looks so much

01:03.314 --> 01:05.456
It demands
we question everything

we have ever been taught.

01:46.098 --> 01:48.165
when something catches her eye:

01:48.192 --> 01:51.927
a geographical feature that
bears a striking resemblance

01:51.988 --> 01:54.188
to a human face.

01:54.282 --> 01:57.617
It looks so much

the image goes viral

02:04.784 --> 02:06.792

02:06.952 --> 02:10.963
as the "Badlands Guardian."

02:11.123 --> 02:13.448
It is quite striking.
It is clearly a face.

02:13.509 --> 02:16.802
The brow, the nose, the lips,
the chin are well formed.

02:16.962 --> 02:19.213
The headdress a little less so,

02:19.307 --> 02:22.290
but clearly could be seen
as feathers.

02:22.352 --> 02:25.311
The Badlands Guardian appears
to be a huge geoglyph

02:25.471 --> 02:27.647
near Alberta, Canada.

02:27.807 --> 02:31.041
And to see it from Google Earth
or from satellite imagery,

02:31.069 --> 02:35.379
you would think it was created
by people many, many years ago.

02:35.406 --> 02:39.066
"Geo" means Earth,
and glyphs are symbols,

02:39.160 --> 02:42.736
so "geoglyph" means
symbols on the Earth.

02:42.830 --> 02:45.723
They can be geometric designs,
they can be...

02:45.750 --> 02:47.725
animals, they can be faces.

02:47.752 --> 02:49.576
Some of them are carved

02:49.671 --> 02:52.004

like we find in Nazca.

02:52.164 --> 02:54.173

02:56.260 --> 02:58.160
The Badlands Guardian

02:58.221 --> 03:02.014
is a bust, or a head
and shoulders presentation,

03:02.174 --> 03:05.576
of a male indigenous person.

03:05.603 --> 03:07.428
It is so striking,

03:07.522 --> 03:10.748
because that is the indigenous
people of the area.

03:10.775 --> 03:13.192
It doesn't look like a Scotsman
wearing a kilt.

03:13.352 --> 03:15.528
It doesn't look like
an African warrior.

03:15.688 --> 03:20.257
It looks like an indigenous,
uh, native to the area.

03:20.284 --> 03:23.369
NARRATOR: Is it possible that
the likeness of a human face

03:23.529 --> 03:26.372
naturally formed in the Earth?

03:26.532 --> 03:29.191
Many who have examined
the Badlands Guardian

03:29.252 --> 03:32.770
suggest that, based on the
amount of detail it displays,

03:32.797 --> 03:36.215
this is highly unlikely.

03:36.375 --> 03:38.353
When the mainstream
scientific community

03:38.377 --> 03:40.627
looks at the Badlands Guardian,

03:40.722 --> 03:43.242
their first explanation is that
it was created by weathering,

03:43.266 --> 03:45.132
uh, rain and water runoff.

03:45.226 --> 03:47.284
But there's just so much detail

03:47.311 --> 03:49.311
that we're seeing
in this formation

03:49.397 --> 03:51.542
that it goes way beyond
anything nature could make.

03:51.566 --> 03:53.882
It not only has
basic facial features,

03:53.943 --> 03:57.052
it has secondary facial
features, such as the eyelid.

03:57.113 --> 03:58.799
The only thing missing
from the Badlands Guardian

03:58.823 --> 04:00.314
is an ear feature.

04:00.408 --> 04:02.649
Now, the interesting thing
about that is,

04:02.744 --> 04:04.024
the local government in Canada,

04:04.078 --> 04:05.889
they had found
a gas deposit there,

04:05.913 --> 04:07.562
right where the ear should be.

04:07.623 --> 04:09.718
There might have been
an ear there at one time,

04:09.742 --> 04:11.729
but now, because they put
an access road there

04:11.753 --> 04:15.070
and they built this gas feature,
that was all erased.

04:15.131 --> 04:19.091
Archaeologists are often
mistaken about ancient sites.

04:19.250 --> 04:23.245
And what is actually a pyramid
that's now, say,

04:23.306 --> 04:27.174
covered in soil
and has a forest on it

04:27.268 --> 04:30.511
can be mistaken
for just a natural hill.

04:30.605 --> 04:35.090
This has happened in...
in South America, in China,

04:35.151 --> 04:37.668
Archaeologists
are continually finding

04:37.695 --> 04:40.004
that things
they think are natural

04:40.031 --> 04:42.264
are actually artificial.

04:42.325 --> 04:45.767
NARRATOR: Some of the geoglyphs
found around the world

04:45.828 --> 04:49.530
were formed simply by removing
the top layer of soil

04:49.624 --> 04:53.017
to expose the lighter colored
dirt underneath.

04:53.044 --> 04:56.520
But if the Badlands Guardian
is also a geoglyph,

04:56.547 --> 05:00.858
creating it would have been
an enormous undertaking.

05:00.885 --> 05:05.546
The massive concave formation
is almost half a mile long

05:05.640 --> 05:08.957
and it is over 1,100 feet wide.

05:09.018 --> 05:11.126
For comparison,

05:11.187 --> 05:14.313
the Mount Rushmore National
Monument in South Dakota,

05:14.473 --> 05:16.723
which was completed in 1941,

05:16.818 --> 05:18.892
is approximately 80 feet tall

05:18.986 --> 05:21.895
and 200 feet wide.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.109
And while it is only
a fraction of the size

05:24.149 --> 05:25.732
of the Badlands Guardian,

05:25.827 --> 05:29.328
constructing it required
an enormous amount of work,

05:29.488 --> 05:31.413
even with modern technology.

05:33.158 --> 05:35.909
The carving
officially started in 1927,

05:36.003 --> 05:39.229
and it was
considered complete in 1941.

05:39.257 --> 05:41.841
My grandfather was
on the mountain

05:42.001 --> 05:45.660
approximately from 1933 to 1941.

05:45.721 --> 05:48.496
He was chief carver
on Mount Rushmore.

05:48.558 --> 05:50.165
It took about 400 workers.

05:50.226 --> 05:52.334
It took 14 years.

05:52.395 --> 05:56.080
And when I think about
the amount of time and effort

05:56.107 --> 05:58.524
that it took
for people in the '30s

05:58.684 --> 06:01.085
to create Mount Rushmore,

06:01.112 --> 06:03.195
I can't even begin to imagine

06:03.355 --> 06:05.772
what the person or persons
had to do,

06:05.867 --> 06:08.053
working on something the size
of the Badlands Guardian.

06:08.077 --> 06:11.111
I-I can't even wrap my head
around it.

06:11.205 --> 06:13.597
How was it possible
that the people that carved this

06:13.624 --> 06:15.374
thousands of years ago

06:15.534 --> 06:17.543
were able to see
what they were doing

06:17.703 --> 06:19.603
or know what they were doing?

06:19.630 --> 06:23.698
They must have had assistance

06:32.551 --> 06:34.618
Well, then the answer is:

06:34.645 --> 06:36.787
people on the ground wanted

to signal someone up in the sky.

NARRATOR:
For ancient astronaut theorists,

06:44.229 --> 06:46.189
the Badlands Guardian
could offer

06:46.240 --> 06:48.482
some of the most compelling
new evidence

06:48.576 --> 06:50.968
that extraterrestrial
intervention occurred on Earth

06:50.995 --> 06:52.986

of the Badlands Guardian

07:21.817 --> 07:24.501
is very striking
as this Native American figure,

07:24.528 --> 07:26.748
and there are some properties
that are unusual.

07:26.772 --> 07:28.447

We'll start with an overview

07:35.873 --> 07:38.365
of the Badlands Guardian
image here.

07:38.459 --> 07:40.793
We see the figure in the middle

the surrounding landform's

07:42.505 --> 07:44.705
very similar in morphology.

07:44.799 --> 07:47.508
So, now what we'll do is
we'll zoom up on the figure.

07:49.178 --> 07:51.198
You can see it
a little bit more clearly,

07:51.222 --> 07:54.622
the, um, this iconic face, so...

07:54.684 --> 07:57.292
what can we do to bring out,
you know, some information?

07:57.353 --> 08:00.312
Well, we ran a program
that extracts the height,

08:00.472 --> 08:03.482
or elevation,
uh, from the figure.

08:03.642 --> 08:06.468
And the way it's depicted here
is... is: dark is low

08:06.529 --> 08:08.970
and bright is high.

08:09.031 --> 08:12.049
So now, after we've taken
the image and texture-mapped it

08:12.076 --> 08:15.052
onto the elevation surface,
we can view it in 3D.

08:15.079 --> 08:17.888
And, um, now
I'm moving around it

08:17.915 --> 08:21.408
and viewing it like
we might see it in a drone.

08:21.502 --> 08:23.689
And as you can see, when
you're looking straight down

08:23.713 --> 08:25.337
on the Badlands Guardian,

08:25.497 --> 08:27.898
it's, uh,
this uncanny resemblance

08:27.925 --> 08:29.341
to a Native American.

08:29.501 --> 08:31.326
But as we look off angle,

from ground level,

08:34.222 --> 08:37.999

08:38.059 --> 08:40.409

08:48.904 --> 08:52.364
If the Badlands Guardian
still appears as a face

08:52.524 --> 08:55.442

it could strengthen the argument

08:55.536 --> 08:58.853
that it's
an artificial structure.

08:58.914 --> 09:01.615
And as you can see, what we've
simulated here in these views

09:01.709 --> 09:04.117
are noontime views,
so the Sun is at noon,

09:04.211 --> 09:05.878

and the winter.

09:08.049 --> 09:10.110
Notice in the winter
the shadows are longer.

09:10.134 --> 09:12.051

09:16.140 --> 09:17.743

it's very interesting,

as geoglyphs.

11:01.653 --> 11:03.887
CARLOTTO:
Gauss' idea was simple,

11:03.914 --> 11:05.889
that tracks of forests
be planted

11:05.916 --> 11:07.407
in the shape of right triangles

11:07.501 --> 11:11.486
so that at great distances,

11:11.547 --> 11:14.898
patterns of triangles
would be visible from space.

11:14.925 --> 11:19.236
He tried to come up with an idea
of how we could signal

11:19.263 --> 11:21.680
our existence here down
on Earth,

11:21.840 --> 11:23.757
and not just signal,

11:23.851 --> 11:25.971
but to tell 'em that we
were intelligent.

11:27.521 --> 11:30.914
So what he devised
was to create

11:30.941 --> 11:34.267
this huge geoglyph in Siberia

11:34.361 --> 11:36.945
showing the Pythagorean
triangle.

11:39.533 --> 11:41.867
This is something
that you can only work out

11:42.027 --> 11:44.519
if you have mathematical
knowledge.

11:44.580 --> 11:47.113
So he wanted to convey
this knowledge

11:47.208 --> 11:51.376
to these intelligences
outside of our own planet.

that these geoglyphs

12:25.079 --> 12:26.987
were created by ancient people

12:27.081 --> 12:30.732

NEWMAN:
We have earthen geoglyphs

were using the Earth

14:41.039 --> 14:44.124
One part of Gauss's hypothesis

14:44.218 --> 14:47.277
that now seems very plausible
is the idea

That day may be closer
than we think,

15:08.409 --> 15:11.134
how to view the surfaces
of faraway planets

15:11.161 --> 15:14.988
through a process called
gravitational lensing.

15:15.082 --> 15:17.398
A regular lens happens 'cause
you have a change

15:17.459 --> 15:20.143
in index of refraction, which
changes the speed of light.

15:20.170 --> 15:23.663
A gravitational lens literally
is curving space itself,

15:23.757 --> 15:26.666
and light now travels
that curved path.

15:26.760 --> 15:29.319
What it allows us to do
in exploring space

15:29.346 --> 15:31.579

15:39.273 --> 15:41.440
a naturally occurring
gravitational lens,

15:41.600 --> 15:43.516
a bend in space-time,

of a large galaxy cluster
in the Leo constellation

15:48.824 --> 15:52.492

too far away and dim to see.

15:54.946 --> 15:57.066

a gravitational lens

it is possible that one day we

that magnified,

visitors would return?

16:34.995 --> 16:38.330

spindly human being.

16:54.839 --> 16:56.740
Then you have the Atacama Giant

are of a full figure who is
looking directly at the sky.

is different.

Certain areas of the world
are hotbeds of UFO activity.

22:55.792 --> 23:00.027
And, in fact, Alberta, Canada,
is one of these hotbeds.

23:00.088 --> 23:05.108
There's constantly UFO sightings
in the day and night,

23:05.135 --> 23:08.794
and there's quite a few photos
and films that can be seen.

23:08.889 --> 23:13.449
In 2009 alone, there were
over 150 reported sightings

23:13.476 --> 23:16.377
of UFOs in Alberta.

23:16.438 --> 23:19.380
One of the most famous
UFO sightings in that area

23:19.441 --> 23:21.382
happened in 1967

23:21.443 --> 23:25.128
when a person named Warren Smith
and two of his friends

23:25.155 --> 23:26.905
were out walking in this area,

23:27.065 --> 23:30.391
and in broad daylight,
they then saw

23:30.452 --> 23:35.163
a silvery, disc-shaped UFO
hovering around the trees.

23:36.499 --> 23:38.416
The witnesses took their photos,

23:38.576 --> 23:41.044
and then, finally,
the UFO vanished.

23:42.580 --> 23:44.400
HENRY:
Warren Smith's photos

23:44.424 --> 23:46.569
of this craft
as it was lifting into the sky

23:46.593 --> 23:49.910
were analyzed by
the Photo Interpretation Center.

23:49.971 --> 23:53.264
The experts there determined
that the photos were real

23:53.424 --> 23:55.119
and that it matched
the description

23:55.143 --> 23:56.842
of what he said he saw,

23:56.937 --> 23:59.495
suggesting that this
was a genuine experience

23:59.522 --> 24:04.350
and that these were, in fact,
genuine photos of a craft.

24:04.444 --> 24:06.945
The area where Warren Smith
took the photos isn't far

24:07.105 --> 24:09.249
from where the Badlands Guardian
is located.

24:09.273 --> 24:11.115
Does this suggest that aliens

24:11.275 --> 24:13.600
have a continuing interest
in this area?

24:13.662 --> 24:17.697
CHILDRESS: With all of this
UFO activity in Alberta,

24:17.791 --> 24:20.941
and it's in the vicinity
of the Badlands Guardian,

24:21.002 --> 24:25.463
you have to wonder
if this area isn't some portal

24:25.623 --> 24:29.692
or inter-dimensional spot

24:29.719 --> 24:32.712
where UFOs are coming and going.

24:32.806 --> 24:34.951
And you have to wonder
if it's something to do

24:34.975 --> 24:36.290
with the Badlands Guardian.

24:36.351 --> 24:38.868
NARRATOR:
Does the Badlands Guardian

24:38.895 --> 24:40.478
represent a medicine man

24:40.638 --> 24:43.648
who communicated
with the Star People?

24:43.808 --> 24:46.467
Or could it be depicting
a star being,

24:46.528 --> 24:48.894
one who taught the indigenous
people of the region

24:48.989 --> 24:52.657
a means of communicating
with extraterrestrials?

24:52.817 --> 24:56.402
Ancient astronaut theorists
believe the answer can be found

24:56.496 --> 25:00.389
only by forensically examining
the Badlands Guardian

25:00.417 --> 25:02.483
and taking a closer look

25:02.544 --> 25:04.961
at the shape
of the figure's head.

25:13.346 --> 25:16.239
NARRATOR:
Los Angeles, California.

25:16.266 --> 25:20.243
February 2019.

25:20.270 --> 25:24.188
Ancient astronaut theorist
Giorgio Tsoukalos is meeting up

25:24.348 --> 25:27.007
with forensic 3-D artist
Marcia Moore.

25:27.068 --> 25:29.527
-Marcia. Pleasure to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

25:29.687 --> 25:31.090
-How are you? Okay.
-Come on in.

25:31.114 --> 25:33.680
Wow, look at this space.

25:33.742 --> 25:35.386
NARRATOR: Since learning
about the Badlands Guardian,

25:35.410 --> 25:36.926
Marcia has been working

25:36.953 --> 25:38.928
to reconstruct it digitally

25:38.955 --> 25:41.855
to see what it would look like
as a three-dimensional head

25:41.916 --> 25:44.283
and perhaps provide
further clues

25:44.377 --> 25:48.271
as to who or what
it was modeled after.

25:48.298 --> 25:50.882
-Pull up a chair.
-Great.

25:51.042 --> 25:53.279
-And we'll discuss this guardian.
-Uh-huh.

25:53.303 --> 25:55.720
So, you've taken this,

25:55.880 --> 25:57.388
and clearly you've seen the face

25:57.548 --> 26:00.116
and decided
to recreate the face.

26:00.143 --> 26:01.117
-Absolutely.
-Okay.

26:01.144 --> 26:02.785
And what did you come up with?

26:02.812 --> 26:04.637
Well, the first step for me

26:04.731 --> 26:07.456
is to just take a look
at the terrain.

26:07.484 --> 26:10.884
I think, honestly, the whole
aerial view when you look at it,

26:10.945 --> 26:13.813
there's a whole storyboard
of information going on here.

26:13.907 --> 26:17.133
But we're focusing on this face
because this is very prominent.

26:17.160 --> 26:19.151
So, you can tell

26:19.245 --> 26:22.822
we've got a neck area
that's rather extended.

26:22.916 --> 26:24.082
Some feathers,

26:24.242 --> 26:25.583
and then, also, this elongation

26:25.743 --> 26:28.753
that's forming
around this headdress.

26:30.173 --> 26:32.239
TSOUKALOS: Mm-hmm.

26:32.300 --> 26:34.153
-All right, go on.
-From there, I created

26:34.177 --> 26:35.835
a 3-D sculpture.

26:35.929 --> 26:39.764
I'm starting
with just a normal-sized head.

26:39.924 --> 26:43.267
So, I will overlay
the aerial view,

26:43.427 --> 26:47.012
and I'm going to create layers.

26:47.107 --> 26:50.333
And I'm actually just following
the terrain.

26:50.360 --> 26:52.926
I'm creating this long neck,

26:52.987 --> 26:57.523
and I'm creating
this elongated head.

26:57.617 --> 26:59.766
And here we have it.
This is the sculpture.

26:59.828 --> 27:04.196
Everything in 3-D is mirrored
on the other side,

27:04.290 --> 27:07.350
-so as we turn this around...
-Right.

27:07.377 --> 27:11.295
And this is what he would like
if that thing on the ground

27:11.455 --> 27:13.372
-were a person.
-Absolutely.

27:13.466 --> 27:15.506
TSOUKALOS:
Yeah, that's pretty awesome.

27:15.626 --> 27:18.666
MOORE: You know,
after the buildup of the 3-D sculpture,

27:18.796 --> 27:20.032
I made a digital piece
of artwork

27:20.056 --> 27:22.047
that will flesh this entity out.

27:22.142 --> 27:23.599
Mm-hmm.

27:26.896 --> 27:28.771
TSOUKALOS:
That looks great.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.318
You know,
I think it's really cool

27:34.478 --> 27:39.282
that you've kind of pointed out
the elongation of the skull.

27:40.410 --> 27:42.401
This whole phenomenon

27:42.495 --> 27:46.980
of elongated skulls
exists worldwide.

27:47.041 --> 27:50.409
Not only do we have these shapes
in this geographic area,

27:50.503 --> 27:53.562
but also, for example,
in South America,

27:53.590 --> 27:57.249
in Peru, but also in Europe,

27:57.343 --> 27:59.405
in the Hittite region,
present-day Turkey,

27:59.429 --> 28:02.388
all with these long skulls.

28:03.600 --> 28:05.440
NARRATOR:
Around the world,

28:05.518 --> 28:07.743
ancient skulls have been found
that are thin,

28:07.770 --> 28:10.170
long and misshapen.

28:10.231 --> 28:12.598
In addition to the skulls,

28:12.692 --> 28:15.100
there are many ancient
depictions of historical figures

28:15.195 --> 28:18.696
with extra large,
elongated heads.

28:18.856 --> 28:21.348
HENRY: What's controversial
about the elongated skulls

28:21.409 --> 28:25.519
is that their cranial capacity
is greater than a normal human.

28:25.580 --> 28:28.873
So these may not be cases
of cranial deformation.

28:29.033 --> 28:30.541
These could be examples

28:30.701 --> 28:32.877
of a whole subspecies
of humanity.

28:33.037 --> 28:36.363
TSOUKALOS:
Worldwide, we have these people

28:36.424 --> 28:39.625
in depictions
wearing these long headdresses,

28:39.719 --> 28:43.279
and sometimes
you even see pictures,

28:43.306 --> 28:45.781
especially in ancient Egypt,

28:45.808 --> 28:50.286
where you see the same figures
without the headdress,

28:50.313 --> 28:54.623
and guess what?
They have elongated skulls.

28:54.651 --> 28:57.293
So, you have to ask yourself,

28:57.320 --> 29:00.296
why is there a, uh...

29:00.323 --> 29:03.741
a figure coming out
of the terrain that has, to me,

29:03.901 --> 29:06.560
seems like
an elongated shaped head.

29:06.621 --> 29:08.579
TSOUKALOS:
The idea is

29:08.739 --> 29:10.859
that Earth was visited
by extraterrestrials

29:10.917 --> 29:12.641
a long time ago.

29:12.669 --> 29:15.235
And one of my opinions is

29:15.296 --> 29:20.165
that the elongated skull people
were the actual visitors,

29:20.260 --> 29:22.985
and the skeletons
that are found today are some

29:23.012 --> 29:24.503
of the few remnants

29:24.597 --> 29:26.733
of the people that were here
a long time ago,

29:26.757 --> 29:28.661
clearly people
that looked like us

29:28.685 --> 29:31.660
except for that they had
an elongated skull.

29:31.688 --> 29:33.420
So, that, to me, is fascinating.

29:33.481 --> 29:37.257
Marcia, thank you so much
for sharing your work with me.

29:37.318 --> 29:40.594
You've given me a lot
to think about, so thank you.

29:40.655 --> 29:43.735
-Thank you. -Appreciate it.
All right, take care. Bye-bye.

29:43.774 --> 29:47.192
NARRATOR: Does the
three-dimensional reconstruction

29:47.287 --> 29:50.454
of the Badlands Guardian
point to the possibility

29:50.614 --> 29:53.365
that it was not only built to be
seen by visitors from the sky,

29:53.459 --> 29:56.018
but that it may even be
a representation

29:56.045 --> 29:59.297
of an extraterrestrial?

29:59.457 --> 30:02.358
Could this be the face
of the being

30:02.385 --> 30:07.029
the Blackfoot people identify
as their creator god, Napi?

30:07.056 --> 30:09.698
Perhaps the answers can be found

30:09.726 --> 30:11.700
by examining
yet another geoglyph

30:11.728 --> 30:14.219
that resembles a human face...

30:14.314 --> 30:17.231
on Mars.

30:21.362 --> 30:25.230
NARRATOR:
July 19, 1976.

30:25.325 --> 30:29.051
A NASA spacecraft
named <i> Viking 1</i> enters

30:29.078 --> 30:30.886
into orbit above Mars.

30:30.913 --> 30:32.738
Just six days later,

30:32.832 --> 30:34.981
it takes a photograph
of the Red Planet

30:35.043 --> 30:36.559
that is so extraordinary

30:36.586 --> 30:40.062
it immediately seizes
the public imagination.

30:40.089 --> 30:42.581
In the summer of 1976,

30:42.675 --> 30:45.826
NASA announced that
they had found a face on Mars.

30:45.887 --> 30:49.755
Now, NASA was the original group
of scientists

30:49.849 --> 30:52.091
to label
the face on Mars a head...

30:52.185 --> 30:54.076
it was actually in their file...

30:54.103 --> 30:56.503
and they said that they had
found this formation on Mars

30:56.564 --> 30:57.913
that looked like a face.

30:57.940 --> 30:59.765
However, just a few days later,

30:59.859 --> 31:01.503
they had
a second press conference,

31:01.527 --> 31:03.005
and they said
that they had taken

31:03.029 --> 31:05.087
a second image,
days later, and it...

31:05.114 --> 31:07.176
they found that it was just
a trick of light and shadow

31:07.200 --> 31:08.607
and there was nothing there.

31:08.701 --> 31:10.670
NARRATOR:
Could it be that the image

31:10.694 --> 31:12.723
of a giant face
on the Martian surface

31:12.747 --> 31:15.598
is actually
an artificial structure,

31:15.625 --> 31:18.117
a physical record that someone,

31:18.211 --> 31:21.045
or something, has been there?

31:21.205 --> 31:25.441
Perhaps a clue can be found
by comparing the Face on Mars

31:25.468 --> 31:27.367
with the Badlands Guardian.

31:27.428 --> 31:30.023
CARLOTTO: So,
the face is about a mile wide

31:30.047 --> 31:32.615
and about a mile
and two-thirds long.

31:32.642 --> 31:34.370
The Face on Mars is larger
than the Badlands Guardian,

31:34.394 --> 31:36.952
but the Badlands Guardian
is large enough

31:36.979 --> 31:39.032
that you can still see it
in satellite imagery.

31:39.056 --> 31:40.709
NARRATOR:
To determine if the face

31:40.733 --> 31:43.125
was created by natural means,

31:43.152 --> 31:47.129
imaging expert Mark Carlotto
conducted a scientific analysis

31:47.156 --> 31:49.465
of the Martian structure.

31:49.492 --> 31:50.710
All right, so,
in this overview,

31:50.734 --> 31:52.546
we see the Face on Mars
in the middle.

31:52.570 --> 31:54.245
One of the tests that was done

31:54.405 --> 31:56.308
on the Face of Mars
was to assess

31:56.332 --> 32:00.309
whether it was an artificial
or a natural object.

32:00.336 --> 32:03.069
We applied a technique called
fractal, uh, analysis

32:03.131 --> 32:06.649
to model
the background terrain locally.

32:06.676 --> 32:09.318
We have a filter that basically
computes a little fractal model

32:09.345 --> 32:11.077
as it moves over the image.

32:11.139 --> 32:13.413
And we see,
if we go back and forth here

32:13.474 --> 32:15.674
to the original image

32:15.768 --> 32:17.579
and now the output
of the fractal model,

32:17.603 --> 32:21.421
fractal filter, the face
has a very high response.

32:21.482 --> 32:22.848
And this was a very, uh,

32:22.942 --> 32:25.501
unexpected result,
uh, at the time.

32:25.528 --> 32:26.927
And the fractal technique found

32:26.988 --> 32:28.590
that it doesn't
just look like a face

32:28.614 --> 32:30.342
but it actually is,
statistically,

32:30.366 --> 32:31.765
in terms of the structure,

32:31.826 --> 32:34.026
different
from the surrounding landforms.

32:34.120 --> 32:37.196
One criticism
of this formation is

32:37.290 --> 32:39.364
that, in more recent images,

32:39.459 --> 32:43.443
the impression of a face
is much less evident.

32:43.504 --> 32:46.130
The structure appears
much more highly eroded.

32:46.290 --> 32:48.357
But if it is an ancient feature,

32:48.384 --> 32:51.026
you would expect erosion
would have taken its toll

32:51.053 --> 32:52.878
over the course of time.

32:52.972 --> 32:54.955
If we flip it back and forth,

32:55.016 --> 32:56.994
there's a very high degree
of correspondence

32:57.018 --> 32:58.954
between the left
and the right side, making it

32:58.978 --> 33:00.794
a highly bisymmetrical object.

33:00.855 --> 33:04.464
Bisymmetry would imply
an artificial, uh, construction,

33:04.525 --> 33:07.209
'cause nature would have
to conspire quite a bit

33:07.236 --> 33:10.212
to create something that's not
only face-like but bisymmetrical

33:10.239 --> 33:14.140
and possessing all the detail
that the Face on Mars possesses.

33:14.202 --> 33:17.143
The other interesting thing
about the Face on Mars

33:17.205 --> 33:20.572
is that NASA has taken,
over the last 25, 30 years,

33:20.666 --> 33:23.483
over 40 images
of the Face on Mars,

33:23.544 --> 33:26.504
a formation that they say
they have no interest in.

33:26.664 --> 33:29.322
NARRATOR:
If the Face on Mars is, in fact,

33:29.383 --> 33:32.417
a fabricated structure,
who built it?

33:32.512 --> 33:35.087
Does it have a connection
to the giant face

33:35.181 --> 33:37.831
recently discovered in Canada

33:37.892 --> 33:40.667
and perhaps other structures
around the globe

33:40.728 --> 33:43.746
that were made to be seen
from the sky?

33:43.773 --> 33:45.931
Curiously,

33:46.025 --> 33:49.026
many who have examined
the Face on Mars have observed

33:49.186 --> 33:51.511
that the area surrounding it
seems to point

33:51.572 --> 33:54.865
to a connection
to one specific place on Earth,

33:55.025 --> 33:56.942
Egypt.

33:57.036 --> 33:59.076
HENRY:
Something extraordinary happened

33:59.196 --> 34:02.264
when we started taking pictures
of the surface of Mars.

34:02.291 --> 34:06.769
We saw what appeared to be
pyramids on the surface of Mars.

34:06.796 --> 34:08.437
It's mind-blowing,

34:08.464 --> 34:12.791
because these match
the pyramids of ancient Egypt.

34:12.885 --> 34:16.110
Is there a connection
between Mars and Egypt?

34:16.138 --> 34:17.704
Well, indeed, there is.

34:17.764 --> 34:19.947
The city of Cairo

34:19.976 --> 34:22.708
was originally called
al-Qahirah, which meant

34:22.770 --> 34:26.045
"City of Mars"
or "the Victorious."

34:26.107 --> 34:28.974
The Egyptians referred
to the Sphinx

34:29.068 --> 34:31.051
as Ra-Horakhty,

34:31.112 --> 34:33.478
which means
"Place of the Horizon,"

34:33.572 --> 34:37.389
which is the very same name
that they gave to Mars.

34:37.451 --> 34:40.560
So there seems to be
a-a deep-embedded memory

34:40.621 --> 34:43.246
in ancient Egypt of
a correspondence or a connection

34:43.407 --> 34:45.324
between Egyptian civilization

34:45.418 --> 34:47.918
and one
that might have been on Mars.

34:48.078 --> 34:50.920
POPE:
If we are dealing with something

34:51.081 --> 34:53.424
extraterrestrial in origin,

34:53.583 --> 34:57.077
then the-the Egyptian connection

34:57.138 --> 34:58.762
is very telling,

34:58.922 --> 35:01.581
because many, many speculations

35:01.642 --> 35:06.920
about the extraterrestrial links
with ancient Egypt.

35:06.981 --> 35:09.665
NARRATOR:
But if there is a connection

35:09.692 --> 35:13.259
between the Cydonia region
of Mars and ancient Egypt,

35:13.321 --> 35:15.595
what is the significance?

35:15.656 --> 35:18.173
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest

35:18.200 --> 35:20.342
further clues can be found

35:20.369 --> 35:23.436
by taking a closer look
at the Badlands Guardian

35:23.497 --> 35:26.865
and the famous ruler
it's thought to depict.

35:26.959 --> 35:29.518
CHILDRESS:
The Badlands Guardian

35:29.545 --> 35:31.854
is very similar

35:31.881 --> 35:33.856
to the statues of Akhenaten,

35:33.883 --> 35:36.708
the renegade Egyptian pharaoh.

35:36.802 --> 35:39.361
He and Nefertiti
and their children

35:39.388 --> 35:41.546
all had elongated heads,

35:41.641 --> 35:44.624
as we see all around the world

35:44.685 --> 35:49.295
and is often associated
with extraterrestrials.

35:49.357 --> 35:52.799
When you put an image of
the Egyptian pharaoh, Akhenaten,

35:52.860 --> 35:55.544
beside the image
of the Badlands Guardian,

35:55.571 --> 35:57.804
they're virtually identical.

35:57.865 --> 35:59.885
When you do the "A" to "B"
comparison,

35:59.909 --> 36:03.994
they both have this long neck,
this very elongated face.

36:04.154 --> 36:05.721
And Akhenaten, of course,

36:05.748 --> 36:08.907
is the great mystic pharaoh
of ancient Egypt.

36:09.001 --> 36:11.151
Ancient astronaut theorists
believe

36:11.212 --> 36:14.004
that he might have
extraterrestrial connections.

36:14.164 --> 36:18.083
Akhenaten claimed
that he was in contact

36:18.177 --> 36:21.828
with a celestial disk
he referred to as the Aten.

36:21.889 --> 36:24.756
In fact, he taught the Egyptians
to no longer worship

36:24.850 --> 36:28.093
the whole pantheon
of over 360 deities

36:28.187 --> 36:30.746
and to only worship the Aten.

36:30.773 --> 36:33.248
And given the fact
that his mummy has disappeared

36:33.275 --> 36:35.100
only adds to the mystery.

36:35.194 --> 36:38.845
Is this, in fact,
a human being we're looking at

36:38.906 --> 36:41.590
or could this possibly be
a representation

36:41.617 --> 36:44.034
of some other type of a being,

36:44.194 --> 36:45.869
maybe an extraterrestrial, even?

36:46.029 --> 36:48.780
NARRATOR:
If the Badlands Guardian

36:48.874 --> 36:52.117
is a representation
not of a Native American

36:52.211 --> 36:56.046
but of an extraterrestrial known
in Egypt as Akhenaten,

36:56.206 --> 36:58.531
could it bring us closer
to solving a puzzle

36:58.592 --> 37:01.443
whose pieces are scattered
all over the world

37:01.470 --> 37:04.054
and even on other planets?

37:04.214 --> 37:06.798
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest

37:06.892 --> 37:09.284
that a much more recent
discovery on Mars

37:09.311 --> 37:11.061
provides yet another piece

37:11.221 --> 37:14.189
that may finally complete
the puzzle.

NARRATOR:
Waterford, Virginia.

37:23.734 --> 37:26.151
2017.

37:26.245 --> 37:29.729
Cydonia Institute researcher
George Haas

37:29.790 --> 37:32.416
is combing
through satellite images of Mars

37:32.576 --> 37:35.660
when he spies
a discernible shape.

37:35.755 --> 37:39.815
It appears to be
the image of another face.

37:39.842 --> 37:43.243
Unlike the original
so-called Face on Mars

37:43.304 --> 37:45.654
discovered in 1976,

37:45.681 --> 37:48.414
this face appears in profile,

37:48.476 --> 37:51.769
similar to that
of the Badlands Guardian.

37:51.929 --> 37:53.457
HAAS:
So, in this area

37:53.481 --> 37:54.830
called Utopia,

37:54.857 --> 37:57.090
in a huge impact crater,

37:57.151 --> 37:59.001
is the profile face

37:59.028 --> 38:01.837
that has a beard, a mustache,

38:01.864 --> 38:04.698
and he's wearing a helmet
that has an avian headdress.

38:05.868 --> 38:07.951
When the bearded profile on Mars

38:08.111 --> 38:10.846
is compared
to the Badlands Guardian,

38:10.873 --> 38:13.606
we see the same type of profile.

38:13.667 --> 38:16.518
Both incorporate
avian iconography.

38:16.545 --> 38:18.128
One has a headdress of feathers.

38:18.288 --> 38:19.933
The other one
is wearing a headdress

38:19.957 --> 38:22.115
that incorporates
an entire bird.

38:22.176 --> 38:25.118
I think the culture
that produced these formations

38:25.179 --> 38:29.056
on Mars had a direct
relationship to the human race.

38:30.559 --> 38:32.534
NARRATOR:
Is an ancient story

38:32.561 --> 38:35.813
being told through geoglyphs
that exist both on Earth

38:35.973 --> 38:38.723
and on our closest
neighboring planet?

38:38.818 --> 38:40.709
And, if so,

38:40.736 --> 38:44.137
what happened to those
responsible for writing it?

38:44.198 --> 38:47.640
CHILDRESS: Perhaps civilization
on Mars was destroyed.

38:47.701 --> 38:49.401
Or, perhaps,

38:49.495 --> 38:52.979
civilization began on Mars

38:53.040 --> 38:56.149
and then moved to Earth.

38:56.210 --> 39:00.504
Earth was, in a sense, seeded
by a Martian civilization,

39:00.664 --> 39:02.247
and that is why we have

39:02.341 --> 39:05.992
similar structures on Mars
and on planet Earth.

39:06.053 --> 39:10.163
COLLINS: So, with the discovery
of the Face on Mars,

39:10.224 --> 39:12.407
is it possible

39:12.434 --> 39:14.667
that it's acting as a clue,

39:14.728 --> 39:16.595
it's telling us

39:16.689 --> 39:20.082
that, somewhere here,
is evidence

39:20.109 --> 39:22.417
of a lost civilization

39:22.444 --> 39:25.921
that existed on the Red Planet

39:25.948 --> 39:28.031
perhaps millions of years ago?

39:28.191 --> 39:31.093
That's a very tantalizing
possibility,

39:31.120 --> 39:32.928
and it's one that I know

39:32.955 --> 39:35.764
that every scientist
going to Mars

39:35.791 --> 39:37.499
wants to answer.

39:38.961 --> 39:40.801
HAAS:
Maybe these geoglyphs

39:40.871 --> 39:43.529
were all part
of some global memorial

39:43.591 --> 39:46.791
that was built by some unknown
extraterrestrial culture

39:46.886 --> 39:49.628
that, uh, has to do
with, uh, human origins

39:49.722 --> 39:52.038
and is telling the story
of where we came from

39:52.099 --> 39:54.059
and possibly where
we may be going.

39:54.217 --> 39:57.710
HENRY: You have to ask,
is there something in common

39:57.771 --> 40:01.381
between the people that
were making these geoglyphs,

40:01.442 --> 40:04.126
and the answer is, is that
they all have similar stories

40:04.153 --> 40:05.903
in these earthly civilizations.

40:07.573 --> 40:10.148
They're in contact
with star beings,

40:10.242 --> 40:12.202
celestial beings
that came to Earth

40:12.235 --> 40:14.819
and are assisting humanity.

40:14.914 --> 40:17.748
They lived with us,
they interacted with us.

40:17.908 --> 40:19.808
Then they left.

40:19.835 --> 40:22.235
NARRATOR:
But is it possible

40:22.296 --> 40:25.147
that not all of the
communications we're receiving

40:25.174 --> 40:29.484
from these otherworldly beings
are in the form of geoglyphs?

40:29.511 --> 40:31.820
Could crop circles,
for instance,

40:31.847 --> 40:33.505
be more recent examples

40:33.599 --> 40:37.083
of a type
of extraterrestrial dialogue?

40:37.144 --> 40:41.680
CARLOTTO: If you bring
crop circles into the mix,

40:41.774 --> 40:43.919
there are some
very sophisticated crop circles

40:43.943 --> 40:46.777
that also indicate, uh,
knowledge of fractal geometry.

40:46.937 --> 40:48.503
There could be a message.

40:48.530 --> 40:50.258
They might be communicating
with us,

40:50.282 --> 40:53.508
and we might, perhaps,
want to communicate with them.

40:53.535 --> 40:56.861
CHILDRESS: It's possible
that many of these geoglyphs,

40:56.956 --> 40:59.957
much like crop circles
that appear every summer,

41:00.117 --> 41:02.608
might give us clues to our past

41:02.670 --> 41:04.352
and to our destiny.

41:04.380 --> 41:06.380
TSOUKALOS:
The fact of the matter is

41:06.465 --> 41:09.615
that we have geoglyphs
worldwide.

41:09.677 --> 41:12.527
And with the improvement
of our technology,

41:12.554 --> 41:15.697
who knows what else
we'll discover

41:15.724 --> 41:17.882
in the next five to ten years?

41:17.977 --> 41:22.721
We are entering
a new era of discovery,

41:22.815 --> 41:26.733
and I can't wait to see
what tomorrow brings.

41:30.656 --> 41:33.898
NARRATOR: As we send
more spacecrafts to Mars,

41:33.993 --> 41:36.384
will we continue
to uncover evidence

41:36.412 --> 41:38.644
of an alien civilization

41:38.706 --> 41:41.999
that could have lived there
centuries ago?

41:42.159 --> 41:46.319
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes

41:46.380 --> 41:49.080
and believe
that the human race is getting

41:49.174 --> 41:51.508
very close to the day
when it will unlock

41:51.668 --> 41:54.344
what they believe
to be an alien code

41:54.504 --> 41:58.682
and find a means
of direct communication,

41:58.842 --> 42:01.743
a living link
between mankind's past

42:01.770 --> 42:05.080
and its extraterrestrial future.
