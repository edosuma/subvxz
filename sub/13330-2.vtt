00:07.006 --> 00:09.242
Here we go again.

00:09.309 --> 00:12.045
Were back in Newcastle,
back in our playground.

00:12.112 --> 00:15.482
It means fucking chaos.
Bucking, birds and banter.

00:15.548 --> 00:16.816
I've got a boyfriend.

00:16.883 --> 00:19.119
We're looking at
two new housemates.

00:19.185 --> 00:22.422
If there's new talent,
I've got first dibs on him.

00:22.489 --> 00:25.492
I grill more birds than George
Foreman. Alreet?

00:25.558 --> 00:28.294
I'm young, fresh
and I love bucking birds.

00:28.361 --> 00:30.663
(girls) New boys! (cheering)

00:30.730 --> 00:33.967
# Let's get fucking mortal
Let's get fucking mortal #

00:34.033 --> 00:38.838
Ding, ding. On the first fucking
night. I can see it ending in tears.

00:40.373 --> 00:44.477
What I didn't want to happen's
happened. Welcome to the tradition.

00:44.544 --> 00:48.448
There's a lot of flanter
between Scott and Holly.

00:48.515 --> 00:51.050
Cock is going
to be getting inserted.

00:51.117 --> 00:54.587
I want yous to be my bridesmaids
at my wedding.

00:54.654 --> 00:57.690
Banter was flying.
That's what the dream team does.

00:57.757 --> 01:02.095
Gary's in bed with a hippo.
Charlotte can fuck off.

01:02.162 --> 01:05.865
Why not?
This is fucking Geordie Shore.

01:07.634 --> 01:11.971
I have a degree in pulling.
I'm a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:12.038 --> 01:14.407
Look up "pull it" in the dictionary.

01:14.474 --> 01:18.411
I'd never kiss anyone without a
six-pack. I'll tear the place up.

01:18.478 --> 01:22.449
I talk the legs off a donkey.
Got the looks, the charm.

01:22.515 --> 01:27.053
I'm fit, flirty with double Fs.
Hardest graft I've done is me hair.

01:27.120 --> 01:29.289
(all) Geordie Shore, whey-aye!

01:31.925 --> 01:35.495
# I got a hangover, whoa

01:35.562 --> 01:38.898
# I've been drinking too much
For sure

01:38.965 --> 01:42.936
# I got a hangover, whoa

01:43.002 --> 01:45.205
# I got an empty cup... #

01:45.271 --> 01:48.308
So we wake up and it's a Monday.

01:48.374 --> 01:51.344
Everybody hates a Monday,
they're boring,

01:51.411 --> 01:54.347
nothing ever happens on a Monday.

01:54.414 --> 01:58.918
(both sing) We're gonna have
a party, we're gonna have a party!

01:58.985 --> 02:02.856
We decide to throw an engagement
party for Ricci and Vicky.

02:02.922 --> 02:06.159
But basically it's just
a massive excuse to get pissed.

02:06.226 --> 02:07.494
Fucking dicks.

02:07.560 --> 02:11.231
(banging pan)

02:12.765 --> 02:15.368
I don't find that funny.

02:15.435 --> 02:17.704
I'm foaming at being woken up.

02:17.770 --> 02:22.208
How to be mad when your mates are
throwing you an engagement party?

02:22.275 --> 02:26.246
We're gonna have a party,
we're gonna have a party.

02:43.730 --> 02:48.268
This is gonna be the best party
that Geordie Shore has ever seen.

02:48.334 --> 02:50.236
We're gonna get fucking mortal.

02:56.075 --> 02:59.746
Charlotte's boyfriend Scott has
already made his impression on Gary.

02:59.812 --> 03:01.481
He fucking hates his guts.

03:08.755 --> 03:12.725
My boyfriend Scott is coming to
Gary's house, this is Gary's turf.

03:12.792 --> 03:15.028
They both better behave.

03:19.265 --> 03:22.402
Everyone's getting their mates
round. We're gonna get smashed.

03:22.468 --> 03:26.773
So it's time to spread the word about
Ricci and Vicky's engagement party.

03:28.074 --> 03:29.309
The biggest one yet.

03:30.243 --> 03:34.747
We're having a big fucking party,
loads of drink, loads of birds

03:34.814 --> 03:36.849
fucking, everyone else's mates
are coming.

03:36.916 --> 03:41.454
Just get everyone involved, we're
gonna go absolutely fucking acker.

# "Like a G6" - Far East Movement

03:48.895 --> 03:52.532
If we're gonna throw a massive party
everyone's gonna be there,

03:52.599 --> 03:55.568
gotta make sure
the SBC is looking fresh.

03:55.635 --> 03:59.005
Just the usual, mate,
short back and comb over.

04:02.108 --> 04:04.877
We've gotta look mint
for Vicky and Ricci's party

04:04.944 --> 04:08.381
so Charlotte's gonna book us in
for a fat wrap.

04:08.448 --> 04:12.085
Hi, I'm just wondering, right,
if you do them things

04:12.151 --> 04:16.189
that you wrap your body in cling
film when your feeling really fat

04:16.255 --> 04:17.690
and like a slag.

04:17.757 --> 04:22.629
Everyone is looking so good, they
look different, they've changed.

04:22.695 --> 04:25.331
And I've walked in like a fat whore.

04:34.173 --> 04:37.410
As you can see, it's pretty messy.
What's that?

04:37.477 --> 04:39.679
Think of it like a giant facemask.

04:39.746 --> 04:44.450
Fat slag wrap is where you get your
body wrapped up in dirty clay shit

04:44.517 --> 04:48.788
and you sweat and you lose inches
of the fat off your body.

04:48.855 --> 04:52.859
What if I need a wee while I'm
wrapped? Yeah, what happens?

04:52.925 --> 04:55.028
Just have to wet yourself.

04:55.094 --> 04:59.565
Me and Holly are hoping that we walk
out of there like Kate Mosses.

04:59.632 --> 05:03.302
You've got a proper Nicki Minaj arse
in that. Have I?

05:03.369 --> 05:08.041
Holly's getting wrapped but they've
missed a crucial part, the fanny.

05:08.107 --> 05:09.976
Dead chubby flaps.

05:11.844 --> 05:14.681
Right now I'm looking like
a pottery astronaut

05:14.747 --> 05:18.418
and I can't move, I'm stuck, I'm hot.

05:18.484 --> 05:22.588
I think I'm actually cracking a rib,
I need to lie straight,

05:22.655 --> 05:24.057
it's really uncomfortable.

05:24.123 --> 05:28.895
We know ever minute that's ticking
by we're losing more and more weight

05:28.961 --> 05:31.197
But I'm getting a little bit hungry.

05:31.264 --> 05:35.301
Good job I've got these foot-long
sandwich's off earlier in me bag.

05:35.368 --> 05:37.570
(both giggle)

05:38.971 --> 05:42.975
James has moved onto the SBC,
the short, back and comb over.

05:43.042 --> 05:45.578
He thinks the girls love it,
they don't.

05:45.645 --> 05:47.980
Scott takes it to a different level.

05:48.047 --> 05:51.684
"Did you see the bird I was cracking
onto? She was nice."

05:51.751 --> 05:52.919
She was absolute hanging.

05:52.985 --> 05:57.223
Like fucking Mr Kipling rang up last
night, wanted his tarts back.

06:00.326 --> 06:04.263
Good one that one. It's mint, innit?
Power of the comb over.

06:04.330 --> 06:06.499
Feel like I've been vacuumed packed.

06:06.566 --> 06:10.336
Does it feel nice and cold, Holly?
So nice and cold.

06:10.403 --> 06:12.572
I can't wait to feel cold.

06:12.638 --> 06:18.211
Wow, it actually worked. I've lost
12 inches, what the fuck?

06:18.277 --> 06:22.448
You've lost 10 inches. 10 inches,
this is the best day ever.

06:22.515 --> 06:27.854
I've lost the equivalent of Gary's
penis. Bye, thank you. Bye. Bye.

Cos it's a big night any, Geordie
girl knows she gotta look her best.

06:34.694 --> 06:38.164
Head to the nail bar,
the beauty salon with your girls.

06:39.999 --> 06:44.971
It's the perfect time to have a
gossip and be a bit of a bitch.

06:45.037 --> 06:49.342
It's been so long since we've had a
really good party. I can't wait.

06:49.408 --> 06:52.011
It's gonna be good. It's gonna be...
Eventful.

06:52.078 --> 06:56.649
I think Charlotte is apprehensive
about seeing her boyfriend.

06:56.716 --> 07:01.487
All eyes on you, Charlotte, all eyes
on you. It's all gonna be about you.

07:01.554 --> 07:04.157
Everyone needs to shut the fuck up

07:04.223 --> 07:07.293
and remember this is Vicky
and Ricci's engagement party.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.796
It's not about Scott
kicking Gary's head in.

07:12.431 --> 07:16.669
Holly's the only single lass. I've
found a lad that's perfect for her

07:16.736 --> 07:20.573
I asked what he was doing tonight,
he said he was free

07:20.640 --> 07:25.344
and I started talking about you
and he said he was game. Really?

07:25.411 --> 07:29.582
I hope Holly doesn't take it
that she needs help finding a lad

07:29.649 --> 07:33.853
cos a lad walks in with his
knob out, she sucks him off.

07:33.920 --> 07:37.089
Shagging in the house
has never worked out for me.

07:37.156 --> 07:41.561
Getting set up with a random
might not be such a bad thing.

07:41.627 --> 07:46.299
He's fucking stunning, mate. Like,
proper nice smile, just dead canny.

07:46.365 --> 07:48.234
He seems too good to be true.

07:59.912 --> 08:01.480
Ricci's taking Vicky out,

08:01.547 --> 08:05.218
which is a good thing for us
cos we can prepare.

08:05.284 --> 08:08.988
Get the fridge stocked up,
full of loads of booze

08:09.055 --> 08:14.093
get everyone round so when they
come in it's a complete surprise.

08:19.165 --> 08:22.168
Tonight we're all putting on
a mature party.

08:22.235 --> 08:26.973
Let's just hope everyone acts that
way especially Gary and my boyfriend

08:29.308 --> 08:31.677
Charlotte's invited her boyfriend
to the party.

08:31.744 --> 08:35.548
It's my turf. I hope he comes in here
and starts nothing.

08:41.687 --> 08:45.157
I am dead in love with him
and so happy

08:45.224 --> 08:47.326
and just little gestures like this

08:47.393 --> 08:50.897
that makes us know
that he loves me just as much.

08:50.963 --> 08:53.165
Here's a toast to us.

08:53.232 --> 08:56.302
Toast to the new us.
Yeah.

08:56.369 --> 09:00.640
Ricci will have no say over anything
of any importance in my wedding.

09:00.706 --> 09:05.678
I will allow him to pick something
like what colour the confetti is.

09:05.745 --> 09:09.982
I don't think you understand how
much planning goes into a wedding.

09:10.049 --> 09:14.420
Vicky's talking about wedding plans.
All I can think about is me stag do.

09:14.487 --> 09:18.491
I want you to be excited about it
not just the stag do,

09:18.557 --> 09:23.329
which, by the way, Gary is not going
on. Course he is. He's fucking not.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.530
Course he is.

09:24.597 --> 09:27.166
He's not going to Vegas,
Gary's not going.

09:27.233 --> 09:32.238
He's going to Skegness with James
so they can dance. No girls allowed.

I fucking can't wait for the night.

09:47.853 --> 09:51.357

we've got decorations

We're gonna get fucking hammered.

10:12.511 --> 10:16.749

Me and Scott will smash it tonight.

10:19.051 --> 10:23.789
Everybody thinks it's gonna kick off
between Charlotte's boyfriend and Gaz

10:23.856 --> 10:27.994
It's important to me that Scott
gets on with everyone really well.

10:29.228 --> 10:32.064
I don't like being set up.

10:33.399 --> 10:38.237
But I see him and I'm like, "Wow,
he's quite like hot." Well done Vick.

What your name? Dan.

I'm gonna find a worldie

10:49.648 --> 10:51.851

First impressions,
I just don't know if he's my type.

12:26.112 --> 12:30.683
He is canny fit though
so I'm not gonna make my mind up yet.

12:30.749 --> 12:33.119
Holly's tried Scott,
she's tried James.

12:33.185 --> 12:37.823
It's time she cast her net wider
and tried a cock we don't live with.

12:37.890 --> 12:42.361
I picked out a little worldie, short
dark hair, gorgeous body on her.

12:42.428 --> 12:43.829
She's mine tonight.

12:46.031 --> 12:47.666

Hooray!

12:47.733 --> 12:50.803
My plan's just to get this girl
in the bungalow.

12:50.870 --> 12:55.141
He's actually managed to pull
someone and she's actually OK.

12:55.207 --> 12:59.645
He's broken his house virginity so
let's see if he can keep this up.

12:59.712 --> 13:02.081
Go on, give her one for me.

13:08.587 --> 13:12.424
One night stand well, that's about
to fucking change tonight. Come on.

13:15.794 --> 13:20.065
My boyfriend still hasn't arrived
and it's making us feel so uneasy.

13:20.132 --> 13:21.934
I need an uneasy poo.

It's not gonna be that bad.

He's here. If I was Gary,
I would be shitting myself.

a good time but I am so nervous.

14:16.121 --> 14:17.623
Scott still isn't here.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.359
I think Charlotte's a little bit
scared.

14:20.426 --> 14:24.930
This is the first time everyone gets
to meet Scott. It's a big thing.

14:24.997 --> 14:26.865
I don't want Charlotte
to be worried.

14:26.932 --> 14:30.169
If her boyfriend stays
out my way we'll have fun.

14:32.871 --> 14:34.907

14:37.176 --> 14:38.477
He's walking toward us.

14:38.544 --> 14:43.315
I dunno what to do. Do I high-five,
cuddle, kiss him? Play it cool?

14:44.883 --> 14:46.952
I'm kissing him. I've kissed him.

14:51.290 --> 14:55.294
If I was Gary I would be
shitting myself.

14:55.361 --> 14:58.530
I'd hide in me bedroom,
do not come out

14:58.597 --> 15:01.433
until Scott
has walked out the front door.

15:11.877 --> 15:15.481
It's good to see me mate, Scott.
I've missed the kid.

15:15.547 --> 15:19.885
We're gonna have a mint night. I
know he'll appreciate me new vest.

15:22.921 --> 15:25.924
I'm staying well clear of Charlotte,
and her boyfriend.

15:25.991 --> 15:29.361
I wanna have a mint time
and pull some birds.

15:37.770 --> 15:39.505
Right.
OK? I love you.

15:39.571 --> 15:43.242
Are you having a good time? Best.
It's amazing. I know.

15:43.309 --> 15:49.715
# "Moves Like Jagger" - Maroon 5

15:55.354 --> 15:58.357
Scott says he's not gonna
go anywhere near Gary.

15:58.424 --> 16:02.494
That's perfect cos Gary said he's
not gonna go anywhere near Scott.

16:02.561 --> 16:04.997
So there should be
no kick-off whatsoever.

16:05.964 --> 16:08.167
Me mate turned up at the party.

16:08.233 --> 16:12.171
He used to have a thing with Sophie.
Now they're just friends.

16:12.237 --> 16:14.206
They were shagging ages ago

16:14.273 --> 16:17.943
and it's always been for her
the one that got away.

16:18.010 --> 16:22.147
The fact that he's here tonight
and she's had a couple of drinks

16:22.214 --> 16:24.083
sounds like a recipe for disaster.

16:24.149 --> 16:28.587
I don't know what everyone's going
on about. Yabber is flirting with me

16:28.654 --> 16:31.957
but I'm pushing him away.
I've got boyfriend.

16:32.024 --> 16:36.295
I'm thinking what the fuck
was I ever worried about?

16:36.362 --> 16:40.299
Give us a kiss. Are you happy
to see us? Really happy.

16:40.366 --> 16:44.603
Why was I being such an idiot?
Everything's gonna be fine.

16:44.670 --> 16:51.543
# "Starships" - Nicki Minaj

16:51.610 --> 16:55.714
If this is how good our engagement
party is, imagine our wedding.

17:00.786 --> 17:03.389
Every girl wants
to show off their boyfriend,

17:03.455 --> 17:05.557
if they can dance that's a plus.

17:05.624 --> 17:09.560
But I don't
want anyone to look at my boyfriend

17:09.627 --> 17:13.265
when he's got his dick in a bollard,
humping it.

17:15.634 --> 17:17.736
That is no Patrick Swayze.

17:17.803 --> 17:21.540
Charlotte's boyfriend's a big lad
but I'd beat him in a dance-off.

17:21.607 --> 17:27.045
# "Starships" - Nicki Minaj

17:32.351 --> 17:36.688
It looks like my boyfriend has had
a little bit too much to drink.

17:36.755 --> 17:38.424
Fucking whey-aye!

17:38.490 --> 17:41.493
I'm gonna put him to bed,
have a nap

17:41.560 --> 17:43.562
and hopefully everything will be OK.

17:43.629 --> 17:46.165
Howay, come on, lie down.
Stop it, please.

17:46.231 --> 17:50.269
People are starting to go home,
they can't handle it any longer.

17:50.335 --> 17:53.639
That means one thing.
The party's been a success.

17:53.705 --> 17:55.941
Let's get these birds to the bedroom.

17:56.008 --> 18:01.146
"Scott, you need to be in my room so
these girls need to be together."

18:03.749 --> 18:07.753
Once again the banter's flying
and that's what the dream team does.

18:09.288 --> 18:13.559
I've found the perfect girl. she's
mint. I'm not wasting any time.

18:13.625 --> 18:16.962
We're having a few drinks,
she gives us a cheeky kiss

18:17.029 --> 18:18.664
all the signals are there.

18:19.665 --> 18:23.335
I've got him to bed.
I need to get him to sleep.

18:23.402 --> 18:26.405
But that isn't working
and he's being so difficult.

18:26.472 --> 18:30.375
What the fuck? Just go to fucking
sleep, you stupid dickhead!

18:36.348 --> 18:38.517
Scott is being really insecure

18:38.584 --> 18:41.854
and I can't tell him
everything he wants to hear.

18:41.920 --> 18:43.789
Especially not when he's shit-faced.

18:43.856 --> 18:48.193
Why doesn't he just go to sleep
and we'll talk in the morning?

19:01.907 --> 19:05.544
He's saying I've changed, I'm a
different person but I haven't.

19:05.611 --> 19:09.047
I'm the same as when
I'm not here with everyone else.

19:09.114 --> 19:11.850
I've done nothing
but fucking care about you.

19:11.917 --> 19:14.286
I've done nothing,
I've done fuck all!

19:14.353 --> 19:17.489
I came in here
and I fucking cared about you!

19:17.556 --> 19:21.827
I can hear Scott shouting
and yes, he has too much to drink.

19:21.894 --> 19:27.132
With Charlotte saying she hasn't
missed him, it was bound to happen.

19:27.199 --> 19:32.237
She said "I don't miss him." I went,
"You did not say that to him."

19:32.304 --> 19:34.606
They've been going out
for two months,

19:34.673 --> 19:37.342
been away from each other
for four days.

19:37.409 --> 19:39.678
So what if she doesn't miss him?

19:43.749 --> 19:45.617
(smash!)

19:45.684 --> 19:48.420
Scott is smashing the fuck
out of our bedroom.

19:48.487 --> 19:51.557
I'm banging this blondie,
having the time of me life.

19:51.623 --> 19:55.627
I can hear shouting. Do I leave
the room, stay, keep banging?

19:55.694 --> 19:59.064
What the fuck's going on?
I can hear it kicking off.

19:59.131 --> 20:03.168
It's the first time I've got a bird
here. I'm not going anywhere.

20:03.235 --> 20:08.040
He's a fucking idiot.
I don't fucking care, get him out!

20:08.106 --> 20:09.741
He needs to leave now.

# "Good Intentions" - Dappy

20:27.292 --> 20:32.598
I'm crying in the corner, on the
balcony. Vicky's covering me ears.

20:32.664 --> 20:35.133
But I can hear everything
Ricci's saying.

20:35.200 --> 20:37.002
She is a fucking twat.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.504
None of this was her fault.

20:39.571 --> 20:42.808
I just can't believe
the way that it's ended.

20:46.845 --> 20:48.847
Don't blame this on Ricci!

20:48.914 --> 20:53.452
It's kicking off and then Charlotte
bad mouths Ricci. I'm not having it.

20:53.518 --> 20:57.956
That won't do any good.
I don't... No, Sophie, chill out

20:58.023 --> 21:02.761
She's standing in my face and I'm in
the moment and she's manipulating us

21:02.828 --> 21:04.730
and she's being so aggressive.

21:04.796 --> 21:07.866
All I wanna do
is get her away from me.

21:07.933 --> 21:11.136
(all shout)

21:11.203 --> 21:15.807
Hit me, lash out at me. Get fucked,
you prick. I fucking hate her.

21:15.874 --> 21:19.077
Go see your boyfriend-
No, I'll go see my boyfriend,

21:19.144 --> 21:23.248
why don't you go see yours? You've
just been fucking shagging Yabber.

21:23.315 --> 21:25.317
You fucking slag!
Stop it!

21:25.384 --> 21:29.221
It was me, Ricci and James
sorting them out, where was she?

21:29.287 --> 21:31.556
Running after Yabber,
like a pathetic teenager.

21:31.623 --> 21:34.493
Smell me vagina.
Fuck off! Stop it!

21:34.559 --> 21:39.097
Out of all people, Vicky can stand
there and shout at me and Charlotte.

21:39.164 --> 21:41.199
Is it not chicks before dicks?

21:41.266 --> 21:44.269
Fuck off, Sophie! Watch out.
Leave it!

21:44.336 --> 21:47.739
(shouting) Fucking howay, man!
Vicky, no! Ricci!

21:47.806 --> 21:51.810
He comes to protect his girlfriend.
What man doesn't do that?

21:51.877 --> 21:55.247
Sophie, you fat slag! Your boyfriend
cheats on you every week.

21:55.313 --> 21:56.882
Every fucking week!

21:56.948 --> 21:59.084
Describe it as chaos.

21:59.151 --> 22:03.889
The girls are fighting, the boys are
fighting and it's all just fucked up.

22:03.955 --> 22:08.193
(shouting)

22:09.394 --> 22:14.599
Ricci called me a fat slag. I'm
sorry, but no boy calls a girl that.

22:14.666 --> 22:18.737
It's disgusting. I've always got
hurt by anyone saying that.

22:18.804 --> 22:23.975
For Ricci to say that, I will never
forgive him for as long as I live.

22:24.042 --> 22:26.178
I didn't wanna fucking argue
with you!

22:26.244 --> 22:29.147
It's gone out of control,
everyone's kicking off.

22:29.214 --> 22:33.385
Charlotte's crying her eyes out,
obviously I'm gonna see if she's OK.

22:41.793 --> 22:47.466
I want Charlotte to be happy but to
see her crying about lads, it's hard.

22:54.005 --> 22:56.575
Oh, God, what a mess, man.

22:58.110 --> 23:04.483
Right now Charlotte must be thinking,
"Fuck, if only I hadn't invited Scott

23:04.549 --> 23:06.318
none of this would've happened."

23:06.384 --> 23:08.754
Engagement party's
been a fucking joke.

23:10.322 --> 23:12.657
Last night was a disaster.

23:12.724 --> 23:15.427
It all just came crashing down
around us.

23:16.294 --> 23:19.765
I've asked Vicky, Ricci and Sophie
to leave the house.

23:19.831 --> 23:23.869
As long as me and Scott are pulling,
I couldn't give a fuck.

23:23.935 --> 23:26.371

# There's no way... back from here

23:43.088 --> 23:45.157
What a difference a night makes.

23:45.223 --> 23:47.893
I've gone from this happy,
vivacious person

23:47.959 --> 23:50.562
pleased to be back with the girls

23:50.629 --> 23:54.065
and being so in love.
We felt we were fitting in

23:54.132 --> 23:57.736
and we could make this work
as a couple in there

23:57.803 --> 24:00.172
and then it all come crashing down.

24:04.643 --> 24:08.647
Last night was a disaster.
I've got no idea what happened.

24:08.713 --> 24:10.816
I don't even I wanna know.

24:13.585 --> 24:18.123
Everything's just so quiet
and nobody's really speaking

24:18.190 --> 24:21.626
and it's not the house it was
24 hours ago.

24:21.693 --> 24:25.363
I'm just like that, "Fucking hell,
what happened last night?"

24:25.430 --> 24:27.899
As a family we've been through a lot,

24:27.966 --> 24:32.237
that, to me, was the biggest argument
ever in Geordie Shore

24:32.304 --> 24:36.541
and it'll be very, very hard for
everyone to come together after that.

24:36.608 --> 24:39.177
To be honest,
I wasn't really that bothered.

24:39.244 --> 24:41.680
It hasn't made any impact on me.

24:45.584 --> 24:47.419
Hiya. Good morning.
All right?

24:47.485 --> 24:49.888
Not really, not happy to be here.

24:53.225 --> 24:57.896
Anna's here and Anna always calls
after something bad's happened.

24:57.963 --> 25:01.700
Last night was supposed to be
a lovely occasion,

25:01.766 --> 25:06.771
a lovely party, you were supposed
to enjoy it. Ended up in a mess.

25:06.838 --> 25:09.608
I've asked Vicky, Ricci
and Sophie to leave.

25:10.675 --> 25:13.245
Sophie, Vicky and Ricci are leaving.

25:13.311 --> 25:17.349
But if me and Scott go pulling,
I couldn't give a fuck.

25:17.415 --> 25:22.621
I regret reacting the way I did,
maybe I could've reacted a bit less.

25:22.687 --> 25:25.090
I stuck up for my best mate.

25:25.156 --> 25:30.161
Charlotte, your boyfriend is not
allow in this house ever again. OK.

25:30.228 --> 25:31.863
Understood?

25:31.930 --> 25:35.333
Scott's not allowed back in,
this is a complete disaster.

25:35.400 --> 25:37.636
All right, get yourselves up.

25:40.839 --> 25:43.575
Charlotte's boyfriend
is not allowed back at all.

25:43.642 --> 25:46.745
I feel sorry for her
but it's good for me.

25:46.811 --> 25:50.615
Ricci and Vicky have done this
numerous of times.

25:50.682 --> 25:54.686
One night cannot determine my place
in that house.

25:54.753 --> 25:57.656
I think I deserve it
more than them two.

26:02.527 --> 26:06.865
You feeling OK after last night?
It hasn't sunk in yet, you know?

26:06.932 --> 26:10.535
I'm really, really not happy though.

26:15.206 --> 26:18.643
Safe to say we've definitely
given Ricci and Vicky

26:18.710 --> 26:21.346
an engagement party
they'll never fucking forget.

26:24.215 --> 26:26.851
You don't wanna be in the house.

26:26.918 --> 26:31.723
Need to get out, get some fresh air.
What better way to hit the beach?

# "Chasing the Sun" - The Wanted

26:38.330 --> 26:40.065

Charlotte seems fine. I don't think
it's sank in what's actually happened

26:45.971 --> 26:47.906
What the hell happened, man?

26:49.274 --> 26:51.209
I don't know, Gary.

26:51.276 --> 26:54.946
Because I wasn't there I'm learning
different things all the time.

26:55.013 --> 26:57.682
I haven't got a fucking clue
what happened.

26:57.749 --> 27:02.053
I don't know why
he came in the house that drunk.

27:02.120 --> 27:04.389
What a way to meet me friends.

27:04.456 --> 27:07.625
I wish I'd never ever
even invited me boyfriend.

27:07.692 --> 27:08.960
This is my fault.

27:09.027 --> 27:10.762
Charlotte needs to stop worrying.

27:10.829 --> 27:13.498
It's not her fault
her boyfriend went nuts.

27:13.565 --> 27:15.900
I'll be there for you, high-5.

27:15.967 --> 27:17.969
This high-5 crack's got to stop.

27:18.036 --> 27:21.573
When you raise your hand,
I feel like puking over ya.

27:21.639 --> 27:23.808
No, don't, you fucking dick. (laughs)

27:29.014 --> 27:32.017
We're down at the beach,
it's nice and sunny,

27:32.083 --> 27:35.286
everyone's having fish and chips
but there is an atmosphere.

27:39.891 --> 27:43.361
I was lying there. All I heard was
"psshhh, arrghh, fuck"!

27:43.428 --> 27:47.866
Me and Scott were like, "That sounds
shit." What's going on in there?

27:47.932 --> 27:51.569
The only people I can talk to
are Gaz and Scott.

27:51.636 --> 27:55.573
They've never got any interesting
crack. It's only ever banging birds.

27:55.640 --> 27:58.176
Dan pulled.
Dan's giving it the big one.

27:58.243 --> 28:00.812
He's like strutting round.

28:00.879 --> 28:06.084
I actually do feel like a proud dad,
Dan went, "Can I just get a condom?"

28:06.151 --> 28:08.119
I was like, "Go on, son."

28:08.186 --> 28:11.956
New boys, race... to... the sea.

28:12.023 --> 28:14.059
Go!
Go!

28:14.125 --> 28:16.928
Clothes off, running down the
stairs, breaking me toes.

28:16.995 --> 28:19.164
Dan's losing.
Go on, Dan.

28:22.967 --> 28:24.736
Oh, my God.

What the hell? It's freezing.

28:31.876 --> 28:34.512
It's Baltic.
I get an instant shrivel on.

28:35.313 --> 28:37.048
Dan's got his bum out.

28:40.985 --> 28:44.255
Gary's come up with an idea
to cheer us up.

28:44.322 --> 28:47.392
We're all looking forward to it.
I can't wait.

28:48.927 --> 28:53.198
Apparently we're gonna drive a tank.
This is not a fucking tank.

28:54.933 --> 28:59.938
It's just like this big fat green
dung beetle right in front of us.

29:00.004 --> 29:03.241
It's been through
some fucking shit like.

29:04.309 --> 29:05.977
It's an antique, isn't it?

29:06.044 --> 29:08.746
We're gonna be blindfold driving.

29:08.813 --> 29:12.450
You will not be able to see
where you're going. Wicked.

29:12.517 --> 29:15.186
You'll have to trust your passenger.
Aw, no!

29:15.253 --> 29:16.654
And their instructions.

29:16.721 --> 29:18.356
It's gonna be good like.

29:18.423 --> 29:21.159
At least I haven't got Charlotte.

29:21.226 --> 29:23.428
I get paired up with Charlotte,

29:23.495 --> 29:27.499
probably the worst possible person
who's going to give me directions.

29:27.565 --> 29:29.868
Right, right, right, right.

29:29.934 --> 29:33.938
I've gotta give him directions to go
round this shitty coned path,

29:34.005 --> 29:35.707
which isn't even outlined properly.

29:35.773 --> 29:37.609
Turn around, turn around!

29:39.043 --> 29:42.480
I'm actually worried about having
a blindfold on around you.

29:42.547 --> 29:45.917
Oh, my God.
This is part of the procedure James.

29:46.918 --> 29:50.722
If the communication involved me
sucking his dick this would be easier

29:50.788 --> 29:55.693
I don't know if I trust Holly. She
doesn't know her left and her right.

29:55.760 --> 29:59.197
But then again, she is used
to dealing with tanks.

29:59.264 --> 30:02.567
Argghh, right, right, right, right!

30:02.634 --> 30:06.437
I don't know if you know your lefts
and rights. I do.

30:06.504 --> 30:09.974
You're going the right way,
now start straightening up.

30:10.041 --> 30:14.145
You know what she's like, she could
mislead the gearstick for me cock.

30:14.212 --> 30:16.581
Right, right, right.

30:16.648 --> 30:20.218
How much? (squeals) Left,
left, left! Fucking hell!

30:20.285 --> 30:24.889
Fucking hell, I've never heard Holly
make this much noise since Cancun.

30:24.956 --> 30:28.026
Most disappointing thing
I've ever done in my life.

30:28.092 --> 30:30.128
We're all tired, were all hung-over.

30:30.195 --> 30:33.264
Last thing we wanna do
is drive around a field.

30:35.066 --> 30:38.937
My team-building exercise
has actually been a massive success.

30:39.003 --> 30:41.206
Did you have fun, lad?
Tank.

30:41.272 --> 30:42.373
(laughs)

30:42.440 --> 30:44.509
Thanks a fucking lot, Gaz.

30:44.576 --> 30:49.314
We know not a let you book our days
out. Stick to pulling birds.

30:57.655 --> 31:01.292
I'm gonna get the new lads,
have a lads night out.

31:01.359 --> 31:03.428
Let's see what they can do.

31:03.494 --> 31:05.897
It's me, you and Scott, isn't it?

31:05.964 --> 31:07.765
Team GSD.

31:10.368 --> 31:15.740
Team GSD,
what the fuck's all that about?

31:15.807 --> 31:20.378
James is staying in. He's whinging
about his foot, he stubbed his toe.

31:20.445 --> 31:24.849
Me, Gaz and Dan just want to get
mortal so we're gonna head out.

31:24.916 --> 31:27.685
I've told them I've hurt me foot.

31:27.752 --> 31:33.258
But the main reason is I can't be
arsed to go out and listen to Scott

31:33.324 --> 31:37.328
and Gaz bang on about birds.
If I wasn't gonna be involved,

31:37.395 --> 31:40.865
I'd be stuck with Dan,
asking fucking questions all night.

31:48.072 --> 31:51.709
Nice to have yous on board, boys.

31:51.776 --> 31:55.413
Out with the lads, I love it.
You've got no girl drama.

31:55.480 --> 31:58.650
You, the lads, banter and puling
birds, there's nothing better.

It's gonna be a good night.

32:17.035 --> 32:20.305
We're just talking tactics, we're
saying what your techniques are.

32:20.371 --> 32:23.508
I've told them my technique
pulling birds is confidence.

32:38.690 --> 32:42.093
Everyone's pulling.
Gaz is talking to some bird.

32:43.528 --> 32:46.197
Dan's straddling some bird
on the sofa.

32:46.264 --> 32:49.567
They're trying to chew
each other's faces off.

32:49.634 --> 32:53.971
I'm lying on the sofa with some bird
giving her a little tickle.

32:54.038 --> 32:55.673
Everyone's having a good night.

32:57.275 --> 33:01.079
I'll have you, I'll have you.
I'll have the pair of you.

33:01.145 --> 33:02.413
Come here.

33:02.480 --> 33:06.884
I love a three-way kiss,
but me and Dan got a four-way kiss.

33:06.951 --> 33:10.788
It's a four-way kiss
but I'm angling myself to that girl

33:10.855 --> 33:14.192
so I don't touch Gary.
It was making us sick.

33:16.094 --> 33:18.930
I'm with this blonde bird all night,

33:18.996 --> 33:22.800
she's coming back. I go the toilet,
come back, fucking lost her.

33:22.867 --> 33:27.638
It's like five to three, best thing
to do is take Scott's bird off him.

33:29.440 --> 33:34.011
He can crack on, I'm not bothered.
Sharing's caring. (laughs)

33:36.514 --> 33:40.852
Woah, Vicky's just walked in.
I was thinking we could buy a fish.

33:40.918 --> 33:44.622
I wouldn't give her a stick to look
after. We're going to Middlesbrough.

33:44.689 --> 33:47.024

Middlesbrough! It's fucking mint.

I've woke up this morning and I know
what this house is missing.

34:16.853 --> 34:18.089
Not only three housemates.

34:18.156 --> 34:22.360
Shall we go buy a pet?
Let's have a house pet. A bunny!

34:22.427 --> 34:25.897
A massive, fluffy bunny. Someone will
kick it when they're drunk.

34:25.963 --> 34:28.966
Only one thing can sort us out.

34:29.033 --> 34:32.235
Let have a house fish. Goldfish.

34:32.303 --> 34:34.105
# Shut up and let me go, hey! #

34:39.476 --> 34:42.146
I've walked back in
and I'm so nervous.

34:42.213 --> 34:46.284
Me hands are sweaty, legs are
shaking. I want it to be over.

34:47.452 --> 34:50.388
Hello. Hello.
You all right? Yeah.

34:52.556 --> 34:54.826
I didn't expect Vicky to be back.

34:54.891 --> 34:58.696
I look round and I'm like,
"Woah, Vicky's just walked in."

34:58.763 --> 35:01.365
I just have no clue how to act.

35:01.432 --> 35:06.370
We don't know if she's talking to us
so we don't know whether to go over.

35:06.437 --> 35:09.707
Do you want to come
and talk to us then?

35:10.775 --> 35:15.680
I couldn't like,... I couldn't
stay here after what she did.

35:15.746 --> 35:18.549
I don't even know why that happened.

35:18.616 --> 35:23.855
Everyone had far too much to drink,
nobody knew what anyone was saying.

35:23.921 --> 35:26.891
Sophie lashed out for no reason
and wouldn't stop.

35:26.958 --> 35:29.861
She shouldn't have lashed out
like that like.

35:29.927 --> 35:34.899
My engagement party was a disaster,
everyone had far too much to drink,

35:34.966 --> 35:37.969
said thing's they didn't mean.
Sophie was a dickhead

35:38.035 --> 35:42.507
and fuck knows my behaviour wasn't
OK. It's just a complete mess.

35:42.573 --> 35:45.810
It should have been forgotten abut
and apologies been made.

35:45.877 --> 35:47.678
No apology's been made.

35:47.745 --> 35:52.517
I want to get outside the house, get
some perspective, no drink involved.

35:52.583 --> 35:55.219
I was thinking
we could buy some fish.

35:55.286 --> 35:57.188
And have pets.
House pets? Yeah.

35:57.255 --> 36:01.993
What better way to cheer ourselves
up than to buy goldfish?!

36:09.634 --> 36:13.237
You're going too fast, you're gonna
give them fucking whiplash.

36:13.304 --> 36:16.207
We're in the pet shop
and there's fish everywhere.

36:16.274 --> 36:18.209
This is gonna be hard.

36:18.276 --> 36:20.878
Look at these.
They're really lazy

36:20.945 --> 36:25.783
They are lazy fish. Goldfish make me
so incredibly happy.

36:25.850 --> 36:28.219
They just look so blissfully unaware

36:28.286 --> 36:31.455
of anything else
in the whole entire world.

36:31.522 --> 36:37.128
Wish I was a goldfish. I spot a fish
with poo dangling from its bumhole.

36:37.194 --> 36:42.466
I realise that is the fish for me.
It's constantly got its mouth open.

36:42.533 --> 36:46.404
And Vicky chose my fish cos mine
never had its mouth shut

36:46.470 --> 36:49.340
and looked like it wanted
to give blow jobs.

36:49.407 --> 36:54.378
Should we name them? We'll name one
of the Scramble and one of them Egg.

36:54.445 --> 36:58.916
Can mine be Scrambled cos it's
coloured? Yeah. Go on then.

36:58.983 --> 37:00.084
Scramble and Egg.

37:00.151 --> 37:04.855
Everyone loves scrambled egg and I
just think that it's a good name.

37:04.922 --> 37:07.692
Come on, Scramble and Egg.

37:12.396 --> 37:14.398
We've got fish!

37:16.400 --> 37:19.937
I can't think of anything worse
than Charlotte having a pet.

37:20.004 --> 37:24.508
I wouldn't give her a stick to look
after. I've wondered what animal

37:24.575 --> 37:26.277
Charlotte reminded us of.

37:27.712 --> 37:32.383
Egg's gonna be the first one, he's
out. Go on, Scramble it's your turn.

37:32.450 --> 37:35.019
Obviously it's a lot of pressure
to have,

37:35.086 --> 37:39.890
I feel like a single mam and her two
little gorgeous slimy wet children.

37:44.795 --> 37:47.298
I haven't spoken to Scott
since the party,

37:47.365 --> 37:50.534
since it all kicked off,
so I'm gonna ring him.

37:50.601 --> 37:53.704
(phone rings)
Hello?

37:53.771 --> 37:55.740
Hi, Scott.
Hiya.

37:55.806 --> 38:00.011
I wanna see if he's gonna apologise
and see where we stand.

38:00.077 --> 38:02.380
I don't know what's happening
any more.

38:02.446 --> 38:06.017
You were shouting at me in bed.
I was saying, "Charlotte-"

38:06.083 --> 38:08.052
Cos you weren't just lying down.

38:08.119 --> 38:11.422
I can't believe you're saying
I was in the wrong.

38:11.489 --> 38:13.457
He's blaming it all on me.

38:13.524 --> 38:18.162
I was sitting crying my eyes out
listening to you smash my room up.

38:18.229 --> 38:20.398
I need some time to think.

38:20.464 --> 38:25.503
I don't want to speak to you for
a while. I don't know what to do.

38:25.569 --> 38:28.539
Me and Scott need to go on a break.

38:28.606 --> 38:31.008
I'm sorry, that's all I can say.

38:31.075 --> 38:35.346
All right, I'm gonna go. I'll ring
you in a couple of days.

38:35.413 --> 38:38.783
I just need to have a think
about things, Scott.

38:38.849 --> 38:40.084
Right

38:40.151 --> 38:42.486
Right. Bye.

38:57.201 --> 39:00.604
Right now
I think she's still left upset,

39:00.671 --> 39:03.240
she's still left with zero answers.

39:03.307 --> 39:07.411
And I have no idea if the
relationship's gonna continue.

39:11.215 --> 39:15.653
I am by far one of the oldest people
in this house right now.

39:15.720 --> 39:20.725
It's time I took it easy. I'm gonna
stay in, let everybody else have fun

39:20.791 --> 39:23.661
So tonight is my big night.

39:23.728 --> 39:27.932
Once and for all I want to prove that
Middlesbrough's not fucking Mars,

39:27.998 --> 39:29.133
it's fucking mint.

39:29.200 --> 39:33.704
I don't think I've ever been so
excited to go anywhere in me life.

39:33.771 --> 39:37.975
We're off to Middlesbrough, Holly's
home town. It better be good.

39:38.042 --> 39:41.645
We're all getting dolled up
and I wish everyone was here

39:41.712 --> 39:48.586
but we're gonna make the most of it.

Holly's from, she's buzzing.

40:03.601 --> 40:07.938

she thought she was like the Queen

40:24.255 --> 40:26.123
giving it the fucking big in.

40:31.028 --> 40:36.133
We get there and the queue
is absolutely huge,

40:36.200 --> 40:37.701
they're chanting for Holly.

40:37.768 --> 40:40.971
Holly thinks she's some kind
of mayor or Middlesbrough.

40:41.038 --> 40:45.176
But it's not. She's just well known
for being the town's bike.

40:47.344 --> 40:50.114
It's absolutely rammed,
it's fucking mint.

40:51.482 --> 40:53.150

40:56.587 --> 41:00.891
It's bouncing, never seen anything
like this before, it's mint.

41:02.393 --> 41:06.163
I don't think the girls
are as good as Newcastle girls.

41:06.230 --> 41:10.067
I love the girls in Newcastle.
It was good to have variety.

41:11.669 --> 41:15.105
In the club,
no-one was even arsed about pulling.

41:15.172 --> 41:18.442
We were having a good time,
it was something new

41:18.509 --> 41:21.011
and we were all absolutely smashed.

41:26.383 --> 41:31.188
I'm in the DJ box and it's amazing,
I could do this as an occupation.

41:31.255 --> 41:35.092
I'm looking out at the people
and I feel like a god,

41:35.159 --> 41:37.928
like a god of the wheels of steel.

41:39.563 --> 41:41.932
Everyone's coming up and being like,

41:41.999 --> 41:46.003
"Wow, Middlesbrough's fucking mint.
We're gonna come here all the time."

41:46.070 --> 41:50.608
I'm like, "Fucking get in, it's not
a shit hole, it's fucking unreal."

41:52.710 --> 41:55.279
Middlesbrough's definitely
a lot better than I thought.
