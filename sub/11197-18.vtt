00:09.920 --> 00:13.520
- Lots of interesting nebulous things?
- Yes, sir.

00:20.800 --> 00:25.840
- l don't see squat.
- Well, you wouldn't, sir, during the day.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.600
When the local sun sets and it gets dark,

00:29.680 --> 00:32.960
you can actually see
a luminous layer of ionised gas

00:33.080 --> 00:35.840
around the dying core expanding.

00:36.720 --> 00:39.600
- Fascinating.
- You don't care.

00:39.720 --> 00:42.480
Hey, l like gas as much as the next guy.

00:44.560 --> 00:47.000
Five hours to darkness, sir.

00:49.000 --> 00:55.074

01:05.840 --> 01:08.400
- Carter?
- Yes, sir.

01:08.480 --> 01:12.800
We've never been to this planet before,
have we? Meaning humans from Earth.

01:12.920 --> 01:15.920
- No, sir. Why?
- (Quinn on radio) Colonel. Major.

01:16.040 --> 01:18.800
You have to see this.

01:20.080 --> 01:23.040
OK. You'll have to
let us know where you are.

01:23.160 --> 01:26.160
Right. Uh, head east.

01:44.320 --> 01:46.800
(Quinn) lncredible, isn't it?

01:46.920 --> 01:49.520
That had to hurt.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.520
Teal'c, what have you got here?

02:08.639 --> 02:11.520
l am unfamiliar
with this type of vessel, O'Neill.

02:11.640 --> 02:13.680
lt is not Goa'uld.

02:13.760 --> 02:16.640
lt's not Asgard or Tollan, either.

02:17.520 --> 02:21.120
You know, these markings
resemble ancient Celtic.

02:22.920 --> 02:24.320
Hello?

02:27.000 --> 02:32.400
- Looks like there were no survivors.
- (man) Actually, there were three of us.

03:49.000 --> 03:52.240
- Now what?
- You tell me.

03:53.560 --> 03:56.320
We're peaceful explorers.

03:56.440 --> 03:59.600
OK? We didn't come here
to harm anybody.

03:59.720 --> 04:02.560
Unless otherwise provoked.

04:08.120 --> 04:10.960
l'm Aden Corso, captain of the Sebrus.

04:11.080 --> 04:15.760
This is my first officer, Tanis Reynard,
and Navigator Lyle Pender.

04:18.440 --> 04:23.760
Colonel Jack O'Neill, US Air Force.
Teal'c, Major Carter, Jonas Quinn.

04:25.440 --> 04:28.440
- We're from a planet called Earth.
- Never heard of it.

04:28.520 --> 04:32.000
- lt's...
- Nice. lt's nice.

04:32.880 --> 04:37.920
l'm sure it is. Sorry for the less-than-warm
welcome, but you kind of snuck up on us.

04:38.040 --> 04:41.520
- We didn't hear your ship land.
- No. You wouldn't.

04:41.640 --> 04:44.640
- How long have you been here?
- Too long.

04:47.080 --> 04:51.120
- That's a rough landing.
- (Pender) lt's not as bad as it looks.

04:51.200 --> 04:54.240
We were on our way
to relieve a mineral extraction team.

04:54.360 --> 04:57.120
An asteroid storm blew us right off course.

04:57.200 --> 05:01.520
A fuel line got messed up in the crash
and all the reserves leaked out.

05:01.640 --> 05:04.960
You wouldn't have extra fuel
on your ship, would you?

05:05.040 --> 05:06.280
Not exactly.

05:06.400 --> 05:10.240
The engines are OK. We just don't have
enough power to fire them up.

05:10.360 --> 05:12.480
We have access
to a few auxiliary systems.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.000
Communications?

05:14.120 --> 05:18.000
- First thing to get hit.
- Couldn't even get a distress signal off.

05:18.120 --> 05:21.720
What's frustrating is that our home planet
Hebridan must be close.

05:21.800 --> 05:24.160
We could plot a course
if you could take us.

05:24.280 --> 05:28.560
- That might be a problem.
- We did not travel to this world by vessel.

05:30.120 --> 05:33.600
- We came through the Stargate.
- Excuse me?

05:33.680 --> 05:36.480
Big O, decent walk that way.

05:38.640 --> 05:41.840
- We didn't know what that was.
- A transportation device.

05:41.920 --> 05:45.520
- That explains a few things.
- l take it you don't have one at home.

05:45.640 --> 05:48.000
Not that we know of.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.920
Really no ship?

05:52.000 --> 05:53.200
No ship.

05:54.320 --> 05:56.320
(Corso) How does this Stargate work?

05:56.440 --> 06:00.960
(Carter) Each gate has an address
based on its home planet's point in space.

06:01.040 --> 06:04.080
(Quinn) That address
is represented by symbols...

06:04.200 --> 06:07.800
Carter? Teal'c? Excuse us a moment.

06:14.160 --> 06:16.160
Any suggestions?

06:17.840 --> 06:20.120
We could offer them sanctuary on Earth.

06:20.240 --> 06:24.480
Or we could fix their ship.
l'm just saying it's possible.

06:24.600 --> 06:27.840
lf all they need is fuel
maybe we can find an Earth equivalent.

06:27.960 --> 06:32.560
l may be able to recharge their batteries.
l'd have to take a look at the technology.

06:32.640 --> 06:35.120
And why would we do this?

06:35.240 --> 06:38.080
So l can take a look at the technology.

06:38.200 --> 06:41.040
They have space-flight capabilities
beyond ours.

06:41.120 --> 06:45.600
Maybe they'd be grateful.
Who knows what else they have to offer?

06:45.680 --> 06:47.040
OK.

06:47.960 --> 06:52.240
But charge by the hour.
No flat rate for these kids.

06:52.320 --> 06:54.960
The Celts were formidable warriors
in their time.

06:55.080 --> 06:57.840
Their descendants
may make valuable allies.

06:57.920 --> 06:59.920
You've seen Braveheart too often.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.400
That doesn't mean
we're not gonna help you.

07:02.520 --> 07:04.800
Carter needs a closer look at your ship.

07:04.920 --> 07:08.640
Worst-case scenario -
you end up on Earth.

07:08.760 --> 07:13.120
Thank you. We'd like to see your world
and learn more about the Stargate.

07:13.240 --> 07:17.280
But if you could get our ship going
our first priority would be to get home.

07:17.400 --> 07:19.600
- Let's take a look.
- All right.

07:27.400 --> 07:28.800
T?

07:30.640 --> 07:33.200
l do not know, O'Neill.

07:36.560 --> 07:39.120
- Keep me posted.
- lndeed.

07:54.040 --> 07:59.360
- What can you tell me?
- Not as much as my chief engineer could.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.240
He's dead. l'll do my best.

08:18.840 --> 08:20.480
Still?

08:20.600 --> 08:23.520
There is something out there, O'Neill.

08:23.640 --> 08:25.840
Move Move

08:27.960 --> 08:29.520
Corso

08:50.320 --> 08:52.560
(groaning)

09:10.760 --> 09:13.200
(intense ringing noise)

09:18.480 --> 09:20.480
Argh

09:26.400 --> 09:28.400
Argh Argh

09:31.320 --> 09:33.280
(noise fades)

09:43.720 --> 09:46.400
- (Corso) They gone?
- (Pender) Yeah.

09:47.280 --> 09:49.280
Let's go.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.600
He's dead, O'Neill.

10:01.360 --> 10:03.360
What the hell was that about?

10:03.440 --> 10:07.280
These guys have been hunting us
from the moment we crashed.

10:07.360 --> 10:09.920
With your own weapons?

10:10.920 --> 10:12.520
Captain?

10:12.640 --> 10:14.800
l'm sorry they didn't warn you about that.

10:14.880 --> 10:18.200
lt's been so long since they attacked
we thought we were clear.

10:18.320 --> 10:20.920
- Who the heck are they?
- We don't know.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.760
But they've killed five
of my crew since we crashed,

10:23.840 --> 10:26.560
skinned 'em alive
and hung 'em up in the trees.

10:26.680 --> 10:30.200
- Whoever they are, they're savages.
- Where are they from?

10:30.320 --> 10:35.360
- Don't know. There's no civilisation here.
- We haven't seen any ships either.

10:35.480 --> 10:38.920
Now that we know that the Stargate
is a transportation device,

10:39.000 --> 10:41.040
they must be coming through that.

10:41.160 --> 10:43.600
Sir, she's in need of medical attention.

10:43.680 --> 10:46.920
All right. Let's all get back to Earth, then.

10:47.000 --> 10:52.240
lf you can do something to help her,
please do it, but l'm staying with my ship.

10:52.360 --> 10:55.880
From what you've said
it's still our best chance to get back home.

10:56.000 --> 10:59.280
l'm not giving it up to these things,
not after what they did.

10:59.360 --> 11:02.880
- The sonic defence will keep them at bay.
- That was annoying.

11:03.000 --> 11:06.320
We can defend this position
until you can fix the ship.

11:06.400 --> 11:11.920
All right. Carter, Jonas, get her back
to the gate. We'll watch your six.

11:12.720 --> 11:14.720
We'll be back.

11:14.800 --> 11:16.480
Thank you.

11:29.640 --> 11:33.920
Their planet is Hebridan. By the sound
of it, their ancestors might've come

11:34.040 --> 11:38.080
from somewhere near the Outer Hebrides
islands off the coast of Scotland.

11:38.160 --> 11:41.120
From its position
l've determined that it has no gate,

11:41.240 --> 11:43.760
at least, not one that we're aware of.

11:43.840 --> 11:46.400
Then how did a society
of humans evolve there?

11:46.520 --> 11:50.800
lt's possible the Goa'uld kept a gate there
and took it with them when they left.

11:50.920 --> 11:55.200
The mystery is how the society advanced
so far beyond Earth's level of technology.

11:55.320 --> 11:58.480
These engines are way ahead
of anything we could build.

11:58.600 --> 12:02.000
They use liquid nitrogen
to fuel an ion-propulsion system.

12:02.120 --> 12:07.360
- l can't wait to see how they generate...
- Your evaluation of these people, Major?

12:07.440 --> 12:09.760
Cautiously optimistic, sir.

12:09.880 --> 12:12.720
- Can you fix it?
- lf l can recharge their batteries

12:12.800 --> 12:17.120
using the naqahdah generator, and there
are no other problems from the crash...

12:17.200 --> 12:19.840
- Take whatever you need.
- Thank you, sir.

12:19.960 --> 12:22.640
And SG-15.

12:23.120 --> 12:24.080
Yes, sir.

12:29.880 --> 12:33.280
- Got a name for these guys?
- Nothin' polite.

12:34.200 --> 12:37.200
- What weapon did they use before yours?
- Don't know.

12:37.320 --> 12:41.840
Nobody survived the first attack. Since
then they use ours. Must like 'em better.

12:41.960 --> 12:44.400
- How many could they have?
- Eight or nine.

12:44.480 --> 12:47.040
- They travel in pairs?
- A scouting party.

12:47.120 --> 12:52.400
- Probably trying to test your firepower.
- Which isn't very accurate.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.480
l was trying to wound him.

12:55.960 --> 12:59.360
The one that got away, l'm sure,
is reporting to his friends now.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.720
Yeah, so you say.

13:01.840 --> 13:07.120
Believe me, Colonel, when they come
back, they'll come back in force.

13:07.240 --> 13:12.080
- Sir, Hammond sent SG-15 as backup.
- We have the gate covered, sir.

13:12.200 --> 13:14.240
Good. We have an unknown number

13:14.360 --> 13:18.400
of armed and apparently
hostile aliens in the area.

13:18.920 --> 13:22.240
- We've got your back.
- l brought some equipment to fix the ship,

13:22.320 --> 13:24.560
but l'll need help to get it here.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.240
lndeed.

13:40.640 --> 13:43.200
- How are ya?
- Hey.

13:44.000 --> 13:47.280
Fine, since they stopped the bleeding.

13:47.400 --> 13:51.760
The painkillers aren't bad either.
l should be up and around pretty quick.

13:51.880 --> 13:54.240
Good.

13:54.320 --> 13:56.560
l guess l owe you.

13:56.680 --> 13:59.040
Not a bit.

14:02.520 --> 14:08.720
So... you looking forward to
seeing anybody when you get back?

14:09.400 --> 14:13.600
Mm, l hate to sound like a hopeless case,
but my parents died when l was young.

14:13.720 --> 14:17.360
l've served with Corso since
l graduated flight school ten years ago.

14:17.480 --> 14:23.520
So, he and Pender, they're like my family,
especially after what we've been through.

14:26.880 --> 14:31.680
So tell me more about the Stargate.

14:31.760 --> 14:34.080
How does it work, exactly?

14:34.200 --> 14:38.800
Basically, it uses a dimension
outside of our known time and space

14:38.920 --> 14:42.160
that we call subspace,
and it creates a wormhole,

14:42.280 --> 14:46.960
which is like a tunnel
between two connecting gates.

14:47.040 --> 14:49.840
And how many Stargates are there?

14:51.080 --> 14:53.200
There's a lot of them.

14:53.320 --> 14:56.160
And there are other humans
out there like us?

14:56.240 --> 14:57.440
Oh, yeah.

14:57.560 --> 14:59.120
Yeah.

15:00.120 --> 15:05.360
Some primitive, some advanced, some
non-humans you're already aware of.

15:05.440 --> 15:09.760
Some are good, some are bad,
some are very bad.

15:09.840 --> 15:13.520
But all in all it is pretty amazing.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.200
Yeah.

15:16.280 --> 15:18.480
Sounds like it.

15:27.040 --> 15:31.200
No engine diagnostics,
no life-support status.

15:31.280 --> 15:33.640
We run the weapons systems
off the battery,

15:33.760 --> 15:36.960
but without a computer
we don't know how much power is left.

15:37.080 --> 15:40.560
First we need to give you a boost
to get your computer back on line,

15:40.680 --> 15:43.120
then we can run a full diagnostic.

15:43.240 --> 15:46.400
Know how we can interface
our power source with your system?

15:46.480 --> 15:49.040
l'll show you the engine room.

15:51.560 --> 15:54.960
You know, my department's
more tellin' people what to do -

15:55.040 --> 15:57.280
fly this way, fix that...

15:57.360 --> 15:59.720
don't crash.

15:59.840 --> 16:03.440
Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.

16:05.560 --> 16:08.640
This is the main power coupling.

16:08.720 --> 16:11.440
Well, this'll do the trick.

16:11.520 --> 16:15.680
We'll have to jerry-rig something,
but it should work.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.520
Amazing.

16:17.640 --> 16:22.000
For a supposedly less-advanced human
you're comfortable with our technology.

16:22.080 --> 16:27.120
You're in luck. l'm more experienced
with this than most people on my planet.

16:27.240 --> 16:32.640
Besides, all we're really doing
is plugging your ship into my battery.

16:33.520 --> 16:35.520
Whatever you say.

16:37.760 --> 16:41.200
l guess that didn't sound very good, did it?

16:41.280 --> 16:46.200
So let me get this straight, Major. You're
an officer in your home world's military.

16:46.320 --> 16:52.000
You're a scientist, an explorer, and
apparently you're a pretty fair mechanic.

16:52.080 --> 16:54.880
And l make a mean soufflé.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.680
Sorry?

16:57.760 --> 17:01.760
lt's something you eat.
lt's very difficult to make.

17:01.880 --> 17:05.640
Oh, well, add to that list funny,
charming and beautiful.

17:06.720 --> 17:10.400
Sorry. l didn't mean to offend you.
Rule one when you're stranded

17:10.520 --> 17:15.800
on an alien planet and someone offers
to fix your ship - flatter them profusely.

17:15.920 --> 17:18.280
- Pass me that.
- Yeah.

17:19.560 --> 17:22.640
Thank you. And continue at will.

17:26.079 --> 17:29.120
Colonel O'Neill doesn't trust us, does he?

17:29.240 --> 17:31.800
Trust is something
you have to earn with us,

17:31.880 --> 17:36.880
and Colonel O'Neill is less concerned
with showing his distrust.

17:37.000 --> 17:40.640
- So why are you helping us?
- lt's the only way you make new friends -

17:40.760 --> 17:45.200
take a chance on someone
and hope they don't make you regret it.

18:13.760 --> 18:16.480
Don't move.

18:22.240 --> 18:25.440
- Hey Take it easy
- We can't let it get away.

18:25.560 --> 18:28.080
- l was thinking of taking it alive.
- Why?

18:28.160 --> 18:32.960
- Because that's how you gain intel.
- l know all l need to know, Colonel.

18:33.080 --> 18:38.200
lf those things get a hold of you
or one of your friends, you will too.

18:38.280 --> 18:40.240
Dammit. Teal'c.

18:41.640 --> 18:42.600
Carter.

18:43.320 --> 18:44.440
Yes, sir.

18:44.520 --> 18:47.040
We spotted an alien. We're going after it.

18:47.120 --> 18:49.800
- Roger that, sir.
- You're safe here.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.520
- We're secure inside the ship, sir.
- O'Neill out.

19:13.720 --> 19:17.440
Don't get your hopes up.
This is as far as l'm going.

19:18.200 --> 19:21.800
l've been stuck on this rock
with a novice navigator

19:21.920 --> 19:25.440
and a grumpy first officer
who doesn't like men,

19:25.560 --> 19:28.480
but l will attempt to control myself.

19:32.160 --> 19:34.720
Mind if l have a look?

19:38.400 --> 19:41.440
- lt's not like your other one.
- lt's less lethal.

19:41.520 --> 19:45.920
lt's not Earth-made.
One shot stuns, two shots kill.

19:47.720 --> 19:51.080
So do you have anyone special
back home on Earth?

19:51.160 --> 19:53.200
Nothing l'd care to discuss.

19:53.320 --> 19:58.640
All right, now, that's a little
too interesting for me to let go.

19:59.760 --> 20:02.480
How about you choose a topic?

20:16.040 --> 20:19.920
Colonel...
we can cover more ground separately.

20:20.040 --> 20:24.480
Teal'c gave me one of these.
We can stay in contact.

20:24.600 --> 20:27.200
All right. But not too far.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.440
General?

20:41.520 --> 20:44.080
l was in the area.

20:46.080 --> 20:48.320
ls there anything more?

20:48.440 --> 20:51.320
l was looking for a reference
on the name of the ship.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.920
Different spelling, but basically the same.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.080
ls it significant?

20:56.200 --> 20:58.680
l'm not sure.

20:59.520 --> 21:03.360
At 0625 hours there was a security
breach in the main computer system.

21:03.480 --> 21:07.080
Someone tried to gain access
from a terminal in the infirmary.

21:07.200 --> 21:11.560
- You think Reynard tried to hack into it?
- Do you believe she's capable?

21:11.680 --> 21:15.360
- l don't know. lt's possible.
- l'm on my way to question her about it.

21:15.480 --> 21:17.320
Yes, sir.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.760
General?

21:20.440 --> 21:23.120
lf you don't mind...

21:23.200 --> 21:24.680
l got another idea.

21:30.840 --> 21:33.120
A little home away from home here.

21:33.240 --> 21:37.000
lf the hunters use the Stargate,
why set up camp here?

21:37.960 --> 21:40.560
That's a pretty fair question.

21:45.640 --> 21:48.320
You also do not believe
the Hebridans' story.

21:48.440 --> 21:51.200
That alien l caught sneaking around

21:51.280 --> 21:56.280
was just about to tell me something
when Pender shot him.

22:03.320 --> 22:06.800
These appear to have come
from the Sebrus.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.240
Yeah.

22:14.320 --> 22:16.480
(gunfire)

22:16.600 --> 22:19.680
(Pender on radio) Colonel, l got him.

22:28.440 --> 22:30.400
Pender Pender

22:31.080 --> 22:33.440
l said alive.

22:35.240 --> 22:37.120
- Where is he?
- He was right there.

22:37.200 --> 22:41.840
- l thought you said you had him.
- l did. l had to have hit him.

22:41.960 --> 22:44.640
T, what do you got?

22:46.240 --> 22:48.960
l believe it is blood, O'Neill.

22:52.720 --> 22:54.720
Told you.

22:59.640 --> 23:02.400
There's a connection
dislodged back here.

23:02.520 --> 23:05.120
You got it? Really?

23:06.800 --> 23:07.760
Hah

23:07.880 --> 23:10.560
- Only one way to find out.
- Yeah.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.120
(whirring)

23:18.760 --> 23:21.440
- Unbelievable. Hah
- OK, Captain.

23:21.520 --> 23:25.440
- How do we boot up the system?
- Call me Aden.

23:25.520 --> 23:27.440
OK.

23:27.560 --> 23:33.120
l've been saving this for a special
occasion. We haven't had that many here.

23:33.240 --> 23:34.960
- No, thanks.
- Come on.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.440
No, l can't, really. l'm on duty.

23:37.560 --> 23:39.920
All right, l'll have one for both of us.

23:40.040 --> 23:43.120
To friendship. And to you, Major.

23:44.920 --> 23:47.680
You can call me Sam.
That's my first name.

23:47.760 --> 23:49.760
Sam. lt's pretty.

23:49.840 --> 23:54.000
- Not really. lt's short for Samantha.
- Even prettier.

23:54.120 --> 23:56.160
So what does it mean - ''Samantha''?

23:56.240 --> 24:02.080
That my father wanted a boy. What about
you? Does your name mean anything?

24:02.200 --> 24:08.520
l was named for my Uncle Aden who died
swimming drunk across a river on a dare.

24:08.640 --> 24:14.640
Corso, my family name, means ''smells
like a dead bird'' in ancient Hebridian.

24:15.560 --> 24:20.720
- Yeah, we're a real high-class family.
- They'll be overjoyed to see you again.

24:20.800 --> 24:23.120
Probably not.

24:27.040 --> 24:31.920
l've been stuck on this planet for a long
time now, dreaming about getting off of it.

24:32.040 --> 24:34.240
Now, suddenly, l don't want to leave.

24:34.360 --> 24:37.520
- Well, we'll stay in touch.
- Oh, l'm sure.

24:37.640 --> 24:41.920
You'll wanna know about all the things
that we have that you don't.

24:42.040 --> 24:45.520
- You don't have to make it sound like that.
- Like what?

24:45.600 --> 24:49.280
- l don't know. Cheap.
- That's the only reason you're helping us.

24:49.400 --> 24:51.120
lt isn't.

24:54.760 --> 24:59.120
You know, Sam,
l've never met anyone like you before.

24:59.200 --> 25:00.560
Aden...

25:01.640 --> 25:02.760
Right. Um...

25:02.880 --> 25:05.440
We should remain professional.

25:07.720 --> 25:08.960
Major.

25:19.160 --> 25:21.440
This place is amazing.

25:21.560 --> 25:24.080
You OK?
We can go back to the infirmary...

25:24.160 --> 25:26.880
l'm fine, thanks.

25:29.080 --> 25:32.480
And this is where l do my work.

25:34.720 --> 25:36.880
Sorry about the clutter.

25:36.960 --> 25:42.000
Just cataloguing some artefacts
we found on P4X-131 .

25:42.920 --> 25:48.560
That's an alphanumeric designation we
assign to the different planets we go to.

25:49.400 --> 25:53.280
- They're beautiful.
- The Goa'uld love this stuff.

25:53.400 --> 25:57.440
l'll tell you something -
the galaxy is full of it.

26:04.200 --> 26:05.680
Sorry.

26:06.560 --> 26:10.240
lt's OK. l don't think
that any of it is broken.

26:11.080 --> 26:13.680
You just caught me...

26:15.000 --> 26:17.040
off guard.

26:17.120 --> 26:19.600
l thought it was obvious.

26:19.720 --> 26:23.120
Uh... Oh. No. Uh, what? Huh?

26:23.200 --> 26:26.000
How much l've wanted to kiss you
since we first met.

26:26.120 --> 26:28.680
That? Oh, right. That's, uh...

26:28.760 --> 26:31.040
That was... That's not obvious, no.

26:32.520 --> 26:36.800
- l'm sorry. lf you don't find me attractive...
- No, look, you're attractive.

26:36.920 --> 26:40.440
l just, um... l don't know. l-l...

26:40.560 --> 26:46.240
We just met, and you're injured, and
the thought really never crossed my mind.

26:47.320 --> 26:50.400
l hope you don't think
this is some saviour complex -

26:50.480 --> 26:52.720
l fall for the guy who saved my life -

26:52.800 --> 26:57.440
because l thought you were very cute
way before l got shot.

26:57.520 --> 26:59.520
(phone rings)

27:05.000 --> 27:07.520
Are you supposed
to do something about that?

27:07.600 --> 27:10.160
Oh, yeah. Right. Um...

27:16.200 --> 27:18.000
Jonas.

27:18.120 --> 27:20.320
Yes, sir. l'll be right there.

27:21.960 --> 27:23.920
That was General Hammond.

27:24.040 --> 27:28.720
He wants to see me, so if you're gonna
be OK alone here for a few minutes...

27:28.800 --> 27:34.480
- Sure. My two friends are just in the hall.
- So we'll talk more later.

27:34.560 --> 27:35.920
OK.

27:51.800 --> 27:54.560
OK. Let's try a full reboot.

28:01.080 --> 28:04.080
Transport Sebrus requesting assistance.

28:04.200 --> 28:07.520
We've been hit by an asteroid storm
and thrown off course.

28:07.600 --> 28:13.040
Repeat, this is prison transport Sebrus
requesting assistance.

28:13.960 --> 28:18.080
Repeat, this is prison transport Sebrus...

28:23.400 --> 28:25.280
Crap.

28:27.720 --> 28:29.680
(O'Neill) Pender.

28:31.760 --> 28:34.480
Pender, this is O'Neill.

28:34.600 --> 28:37.200
l told you to stay in visual range.

28:40.800 --> 28:42.800
Pender, respond.

29:03.160 --> 29:05.920
All right. Let's not lose our heads here.

29:08.400 --> 29:11.040
l mean you no harm.

29:11.160 --> 29:15.120
You're pointing that thing
at my friend's head.

29:24.880 --> 29:27.840
Please, don't shoot me.

29:29.040 --> 29:32.320
Whatever you have been told, it is a lie.

29:33.200 --> 29:34.800
ls that true?

29:34.920 --> 29:37.040
l am Warrick.

29:37.160 --> 29:39.200
l am the captain of the Sebrus.

29:53.240 --> 29:56.080
- Hands where l can see 'em.
- Sam...

29:56.200 --> 29:58.160
Call me Major.

29:59.560 --> 30:02.640
- Sam.
- Hands where l can see them.

30:04.640 --> 30:07.600
- lt's not what you think.
- What do l think?

30:07.680 --> 30:12.480
- Actually, l don't know.
- This ship is a prison transport.

30:12.600 --> 30:14.560
Yeah. That's right.

30:14.680 --> 30:17.040
Sit down.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.680
Tie up your legs.

30:25.720 --> 30:28.320
l'm sorry that l lied to you.

30:28.400 --> 30:31.200
- But l just couldn't tell you the truth.
- Why not?

30:31.320 --> 30:33.920
Because l'm the reason we're here.

30:34.040 --> 30:37.520
l don't understand.
Hands behind your back.

30:39.640 --> 30:43.040
l allowed the prisoners
to gain control of the ship.

30:43.120 --> 30:47.280
When the storm hit us
the life support went out in the cells.

30:48.480 --> 30:52.000
- They were gonna die.
- The prisoners?

30:52.120 --> 30:55.520
Those aliens - they didn't
come through the Stargate.

30:55.640 --> 30:58.880
They came here with us.
They were our prisoners.

30:59.000 --> 31:01.280
Prisoners of war.

31:01.360 --> 31:05.280
- Your planet's at war with them?
- l let them go.

31:06.520 --> 31:10.800
We crashed before they could kill us all.
lt's the honest-to-goodness truth.

31:10.920 --> 31:14.880
l was just too embarrassed
to say that l let that happen.

31:14.960 --> 31:18.800
We might have weathered that storm
if l had let them die.

31:18.880 --> 31:21.520
You have to believe me.

31:23.560 --> 31:25.920
Where's my radio?

31:26.000 --> 31:27.120
Sam.

31:30.920 --> 31:35.520
Please, hear my side of the story
before you kill me.

31:42.520 --> 31:45.120
We're not gonna kill you.

31:47.000 --> 31:50.720
- You shot my first officer.
- l was just trying to wound him.

31:50.840 --> 31:53.680
And, as l recall, you started things.

31:53.760 --> 31:57.920
We thought we had no choice. We had
to stop them from enlisting your help.

31:58.000 --> 32:01.920
- And who are they according to you?
- Escaped prisoners.

32:02.040 --> 32:06.720
The Sebrus was a prison transport vessel.
Three years ago,

32:06.800 --> 32:11.520
my crew and l were transporting Corso
and two accomplices to a prison colony.

32:11.640 --> 32:14.160
We hit a storm and began to lose power.

32:14.240 --> 32:18.640
Our only hope of survival
was to set down on this planet.

32:18.760 --> 32:19.760
And then?

32:19.880 --> 32:23.200
We had no choice
but to take them out of transport stasis.

32:23.280 --> 32:25.760
The ship hadn't the power
to sustain their lives.

32:25.880 --> 32:28.080
How many were there of you?

32:28.160 --> 32:31.200
My crew was eight, including myself.

32:31.280 --> 32:36.640
We watched them in shifts. My first officer
and l were looking for food and water

32:36.720 --> 32:40.880
when they overpowered the men guarding
them and killed them in cold blood.

32:41.000 --> 32:44.960
Corso then took over the ship
and used its defences against us.

32:45.040 --> 32:47.680
We tried many times to retake the Sebrus,

32:47.800 --> 32:51.200
but recently
we were just lucky to stay alive.

32:52.280 --> 32:55.200
They hunted us like wild animals.

32:59.000 --> 33:03.760
You must believe me. They are
the worst that Hebridan has to offer.

33:04.840 --> 33:08.720
No matter what,
they must not be allowed to go free.

33:16.440 --> 33:18.560
Who's that?

33:24.080 --> 33:26.400
My wife.

33:26.520 --> 33:28.000
Your wife.

33:28.080 --> 33:30.000
Athea.

33:33.440 --> 33:37.040
My kind, the Serrakin,
helped liberate the Hebridan

33:37.120 --> 33:39.440
from the Goa'uld thousands of years ago.

33:39.560 --> 33:43.040
lt was your people
that brought them advanced technology.

33:43.160 --> 33:45.920
Since then we have lived in harmony...

33:46.840 --> 33:49.360
with few exceptions.

33:49.440 --> 33:53.440
- (radio) Colonel, this is Carter. Come in.
- Yeah. Go.

33:53.560 --> 33:58.000
Sir, l've got everything under control
but we need to talk, in person.

33:58.080 --> 34:00.240
Tell me about it.

34:00.360 --> 34:02.960
Stay put. We're on our way.

34:03.680 --> 34:05.520
Carter out.

34:05.600 --> 34:06.960
Ugh

34:07.960 --> 34:09.920
My thoughts exactly.

34:16.080 --> 34:18.800
(radio) Major Pierce,
this is General Hammond.

34:18.880 --> 34:22.000
- Read you loud and clear, sir.
- Hold your fire.

34:22.120 --> 34:26.719
- Jonas Quinn and a guest are en route.
- Roger that.

34:28.080 --> 34:34.080
Colonel O'Neill, come in, sir. Jonas and
Reynard have arrived back from Earth.

34:36.120 --> 34:40.320
- He must be out of range.
- We'll see him at the ship.

34:45.360 --> 34:48.880
- They're onto us.
- Yeah, l'm starting to get that feelin'.

34:48.960 --> 34:52.000
- Reynard and Jonas are on the way back.
- Where's Carter?

34:52.080 --> 34:54.800
Outside, unconscious.
She didn't buy your story.

34:54.920 --> 34:57.600
Yeah, she's too smart.

34:57.680 --> 35:00.800
- Gotta keep tryin' anyway, huh?
- Yeah, it's in my blood.

35:00.880 --> 35:03.040
She fixed the ship, though.

35:03.160 --> 35:05.760
- lt'll fly?
- Fire it up.

35:13.880 --> 35:15.440
Carter

35:19.560 --> 35:21.920
- We're goin' home.
- Really?

35:22.040 --> 35:25.800
- Pender's warmin' up the ship now.
- You might wanna reconsider that.

35:25.920 --> 35:28.720
Our stash is nothing
to what's through that Stargate.

35:28.840 --> 35:32.080
- What do you mean?
- Going back is not worth the risk

35:32.160 --> 35:35.360
when there are riches out there
beyond our wildest dreams.

35:35.440 --> 35:38.560
Come on. l've learned enough
to get us a good head start.

35:38.640 --> 35:42.880
- They've got the Stargate covered.
- And we have hostages.

35:59.600 --> 36:03.040
(Warrick) lt's a trap.
No doubt they have armed the ship.

36:04.680 --> 36:06.720
We can't leave her down there.

36:06.840 --> 36:09.200
(Teal'c) How do we
disengage the defences?

36:09.280 --> 36:12.240
(Warrick) lt can only be done from inside.

36:12.360 --> 36:15.280
- Cover me, Teal'c.
- lndeed.

36:15.400 --> 36:17.880
l know how to disarm the defences.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.680
l will go.

36:21.760 --> 36:24.000
We'll watch your back.

36:39.760 --> 36:41.840
(intense ringing noise)

37:07.760 --> 37:09.760
(noise fades)

37:25.640 --> 37:29.120
They have Jonas. They're gonna try
to escape through the Stargate.

37:29.240 --> 37:32.360
- You all right?
- A little groggy, sir.

37:32.440 --> 37:35.640
- l will stay with her, O'Neill.
- Yeah.

37:35.760 --> 37:40.640
(Corso) Hey, there, guys.
Why don't you put those weapons down?

37:41.480 --> 37:44.560
You'd best do that now or he dies.

37:45.400 --> 37:51.120
All we need to do is dial up the gate
and go through. No one needs to get hurt.

37:52.360 --> 37:54.480
Yeah, sure. Whatever you say.

37:54.560 --> 37:57.360
That's right. Whatever l say. Reynard.

37:58.640 --> 38:00.720
(chevrons locking)

38:01.480 --> 38:04.480
You get that address from my lab?

38:04.560 --> 38:06.640
Yeah.

38:06.760 --> 38:10.480
- And everything else you said is, uh...
- Not everything.

38:10.600 --> 38:12.360
You are cute.

38:18.680 --> 38:21.120
All right, let's go.

38:28.720 --> 38:31.680
All right, that's far enough.

38:31.800 --> 38:33.760
Don't come any closer.

38:33.840 --> 38:37.920
- Back off or l'll kill him.
- Colonel, just let 'em go.

38:39.080 --> 38:44.080
- Nobody's goin' anywhere.
- Really, it'll be fine.

38:44.920 --> 38:47.360
lt's not worth the risk.

38:52.760 --> 38:54.960
Let 'em go.

38:55.080 --> 38:57.760
- Sir?
- Let 'em go.

39:01.120 --> 39:02.960
Wise choice.

39:19.520 --> 39:22.240
(Hammond) Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Earth.

39:22.320 --> 39:26.360
- You planted the address?
- Call it intuition.

39:33.800 --> 39:35.440
Well done.

39:35.560 --> 39:37.520
Thank you, sir.

39:47.800 --> 39:52.360
- Everybody locked up OK?
- They're all in transport stasis.

39:52.480 --> 39:57.200
Mr Quinn, l never asked you how
you figured out who Reynard really was.

39:57.320 --> 40:02.240
lt was just a feeling, really. Although
l did come across something interesting

40:02.320 --> 40:04.120
while researching the ship's name.

40:04.240 --> 40:09.040
Another ship was built by the descendants
of ancient Celts on Earth - the Ceberus.

40:09.160 --> 40:13.520
lt was designed specifically
to transport convicts to a penal colony.

40:13.640 --> 40:17.240
The names were so similar, l thought
maybe there was some significance

40:17.360 --> 40:20.080
in Celtic history, and, uh...

40:20.160 --> 40:23.120
The meaning of the word never changed.

40:26.640 --> 40:28.120
lncredible.

40:30.080 --> 40:35.520
That, and l've always been suspicious
of a girl who kisses on the first date.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.680
What?

40:39.800 --> 40:44.320
Colonel, l want to thank you
for everything that you have done,

40:44.400 --> 40:47.440
but mostly for trusting me.

40:48.840 --> 40:50.960
lt's my pleasure.
