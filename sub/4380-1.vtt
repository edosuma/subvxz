 My name is Diana Armstrong,
 but my stage name is Diamond.

02:51.394 --> 02:54.394
 I worked at the PIayers CIub
 4 years before it burnt down...

02:55.765 --> 02:58.765
 and to teII you the truth,
 I,m gIad it,s gone.

02:59.769 --> 03:01.970
 When I was a senior
 in high schooI...

03:01.971 --> 03:04.971
 aII I wanted to do was attend
 a famous bIack coIIege...

03:05.075 --> 03:06.842
 and study journaIism.

03:06.843 --> 03:09.843
 But my father had
 different pIans for my Iife.

03:10.213 --> 03:12.715
 You,re not going
 to one of those nigger coIIeges!

03:12.716 --> 03:15.716
 You have the opportunity to go
 upstate to a good coIIege...

03:16.219 --> 03:18.220
 and that is where you are going!

03:18.221 --> 03:20.222
 No, I,m not!
 That,s where you want me to go!

03:20.223 --> 03:21.657
 I,m going to Southern Tech!

03:21.658 --> 03:24.658
 No, you are not!
 Not with my goddamn money!

03:25.228 --> 03:26.495
 You are not!

03:26.496 --> 03:29.365
 We don,t need yo, money!
 We don,t need nothin, from you!

03:29.366 --> 03:31.567
 You must think you grown, huh?

03:31.568 --> 03:33.902
 You think you got
 this whoIe worId figured out.

03:33.903 --> 03:35.404
 If you are that grown...

03:35.405 --> 03:38.073
 you need to get the heII
 out of this house!

03:38.074 --> 03:40.075
 Get out there
 and get a house of your own!

03:40.076 --> 03:42.244
 No! She is not goin, anywhere!

03:42.245 --> 03:44.246
 That,s right!
 And don,t come back...

03:44.247 --> 03:46.248
 tiII you get some sense in you!

03:46.249 --> 03:48.250
 Don,t pay attention
 to what he says!

03:48.251 --> 03:51.251
 Diana, he,II caIm down.
 Just wait. Honey!

03:51.755 --> 03:53.822
 You got that baby!

03:53.823 --> 03:56.625
 -Do you hear me?
 -Mama, I,m gone!

03:56.626 --> 03:57.926
 So to show him...

03:57.927 --> 04:00.529
 I got a IittIe apartment
 with my baby,s father.

04:00.530 --> 04:03.530
 And it was aII good
 untiI he needed his space--

04:04.567 --> 04:06.602
 whatever the fuck that means.

04:06.603 --> 04:09.271
 So instead of checking into
 Southern Tech that semester...

04:09.272 --> 04:11.707
 I had to deaI
 with the reaI worId.

04:11.708 --> 04:14.708
 That,s when I met
 Tricks and Ronnie.

04:18.680 --> 04:21.680
 Ain,t you supposed to heIp me
 try these on?

04:21.951 --> 04:24.951
 You need heIp?

04:32.262 --> 04:34.263
 I ain,t trying to get
 in your business...

04:34.264 --> 04:36.131
 but can I ask a question?

04:36.132 --> 04:38.300
 How much money you make
 working here?

04:38.301 --> 04:39.668
 I make enough.

04:39.669 --> 04:41.403
 Enough to do what?

04:41.404 --> 04:44.404
 They couIdn,t pay me enough
 to smeII feet aII day.

04:45.275 --> 04:47.643
 You couId be making
 a Iot more money...

04:47.644 --> 04:49.578
 if you wouId just use
 what you got...

04:49.579 --> 04:51.613
 to get what you want
 and forget this chump change.

04:51.614 --> 04:54.614
 -What,s that mean?
 -Just what it sound Iike.

04:55.185 --> 04:56.718
 Don,t be stupid, girI.

04:56.719 --> 04:59.121
 Use what God gave you.

04:59.122 --> 05:00.956
 Y,aII some prostitutes?

05:00.957 --> 05:03.292
 HeII, no. We dancers.

05:03.293 --> 05:05.994
 Dancers? Where y,aII dance at?

05:05.995 --> 05:08.995
 The PIayers CIub.

05:11.067 --> 05:12.501
 The PIayers CIub was owned...

05:12.502 --> 05:15.502
 by this Iow-Iife named
 ''DoIIar BiII''--aIways in debt.

05:16.206 --> 05:18.740
 He was the one that gave me
 the name Diamond.

05:18.741 --> 05:21.410
 He said ,cause my face
 was so pretty...

05:21.411 --> 05:24.411
 but he never reaIIy Iooked
 at my face.

05:24.981 --> 05:26.181
 How you doing?

05:26.182 --> 05:27.516

05:35.158 --> 05:38.158
 Turn around. Tet me see.

05:39.729 --> 05:42.729
 Damn, she got ass.

05:44.667 --> 05:47.035
 You can start tonight

05:47.036 --> 05:48.971
 I got to caII the baby-sitter.

05:48.972 --> 05:51.972

05:53.676 --> 05:56.676

06:08.858 --> 06:10.125

06:10.126 --> 06:12.294

06:12.295 --> 06:15.130
 Yeah, you can. You just gotta
 Iearn how to reIax.

06:15.131 --> 06:17.132
 Took around you.
 Everybody here is naked.

06:17.133 --> 06:19.134
 Every girI was nervous
 their first night...

06:19.135 --> 06:22.135
 but they got used to it.

06:22.639 --> 06:25.474
 You drink?

06:25.475 --> 06:28.475
 Here.
 Tet me show you something.

06:31.214 --> 06:33.549
 Try not to Iook
 at the customer.

06:33.550 --> 06:36.550
 Just Iook in the mirror
 and dance sexy to the music.

06:37.253 --> 06:40.253
 Pretend you,re at home
 in your bathroom by yourseIf.

06:43.893 --> 06:46.662
 That,s it?

06:46.663 --> 06:49.663
 And drink as much as you can
 as fast as you can.

06:49.699 --> 06:52.668
 You might as weII get faded.

06:52.669 --> 06:55.669
 HoId on.

06:59.676 --> 07:01.910
 Where,s my money
 from the party you did?

07:01.911 --> 07:04.911
 I want my money,
 and I,m not pIaying.

07:06.115 --> 07:09.051
 -Tet,s go, ho.
 -What?

07:09.052 --> 07:11.219
 That,s what they about

07:11.220 --> 07:13.221

07:13.222 --> 07:16.222
 Now, Iet,s go, ho.

07:32.141 --> 07:34.643
 When it was my turn to dance...

07:34.644 --> 07:36.845
 I was shittin, bricks.

07:36.846 --> 07:39.846
 I feIt Iike a mouse
 in a room fuII of snakes.

07:49.659 --> 07:52.659
 What,s up?

08:20.056 --> 08:22.057
 That,s it!

08:22.058 --> 08:25.058
 Damn, baby! Work that shit!

08:31.801 --> 08:34.801
 You want a dance, Miron?

08:35.871 --> 08:38.871
 What you waitin, on, girI?
 You better get yo, money.

08:57.160 --> 08:58.660
 My first tabIe dance...

08:58.661 --> 09:01.661
 was the most degrading
 experience of my Iife.

09:02.932 --> 09:05.932
 But after a few hours,
 and a few more drinks...

09:06.436 --> 09:08.303
 I didn,t even worry about it.

09:08.304 --> 09:11.304
 The money was fast and easy.

09:11.741 --> 09:14.741
 And I needed it.

09:14.944 --> 09:17.944
 I tried not to Iet this cIub
 change me, but it has.

09:19.449 --> 09:20.782
 You can,t park there.

09:20.783 --> 09:23.783
 I,m not the same person
 I was before.

09:24.120 --> 09:27.120
 God damn it!
 I said you can,t park there!

09:27.123 --> 09:30.123
 I waIked in a young Iady
 and came out a woman...

09:31.627 --> 09:34.563
 knowin, a Iot more about Iife.

09:34.564 --> 09:37.564
 Tike in this business,
 hounds can be maIe and femaIe.

09:39.135 --> 09:40.635
 And I tried to avoid both.

09:40.636 --> 09:43.636
 Excuse you. You better watch
 where you going!

09:43.639 --> 09:46.639
 I had a four-year hustIe pIan
 that was the bomb.

09:46.642 --> 09:48.610
 I wouId go to schooI
 in the daytime...

09:48.611 --> 09:51.611
 and I wouId pay for it at night.

09:52.315 --> 09:54.583
 I got aII the way up
 to my senior year...

09:54.584 --> 09:57.584
 without getting caught in any
 buIIshit the cIub had to offer.

09:58.387 --> 10:00.655
 I had Tance, my new boyfriend.

10:00.656 --> 10:03.656
 And my father and I
 was even speaking again.

10:03.659 --> 10:05.060
 Everything was cooI.

10:05.061 --> 10:07.629
 At Ieast untiI...

10:07.630 --> 10:10.630
 my 18-year-oId cousin Ebony
 moved here from TaIIahassee...

10:10.800 --> 10:12.801
 a month before finaIs.

10:12.802 --> 10:15.802
 And my mama toId her mama
 I wouId keep her out of troubIe.

10:16.706 --> 10:19.706
 I said, ''Yeah,'' because she was
 my favorite IittIe cousin.

10:22.478 --> 10:25.478
 -How are you?
 -I,m fine.

10:26.215 --> 10:27.849
 Took at you.

10:27.850 --> 10:30.850
 Come on in. Give me your stuff.

10:31.053 --> 10:33.221
 Tance, this is my cousin Ebony.

10:33.222 --> 10:34.389
 How you doing?

10:34.390 --> 10:36.358
 After seeing my new apartment...

10:36.359 --> 10:39.359
 she asked if she couId work
 with me at the PIayers CIub.

10:40.329 --> 10:42.264
 Stripping business
 started in Africa.

10:42.265 --> 10:43.965
 Tong time ago...

10:43.966 --> 10:46.735
 Iong, Iong time ago,
 white men went to Africa.

10:46.736 --> 10:49.237
 And he saw aII
 these bootifuI bIack women...

10:49.238 --> 10:51.239
 waIking around, singing...

10:51.240 --> 10:54.240
 dancing, working, Iiving...

10:54.744 --> 10:56.745
 in the nude.

10:56.746 --> 10:58.747
 Bucket nekkids.

10:58.748 --> 11:00.949
 You couId see they pubIic hairs.

11:00.950 --> 11:03.185
 This white man
 went from viIIage to viIIage...

11:03.186 --> 11:05.287
 to seek out
 these bootifuI bIack women.

11:05.288 --> 11:08.288
 Watching them perform
 in the nude.

11:09.759 --> 11:12.759
 Titties! Asses. Free.

11:13.830 --> 11:15.197
 White man got a idea.

11:15.198 --> 11:17.098
 He figure
 he go back to Europe...

11:17.099 --> 11:19.367
 and start the same type
 of business...

11:19.368 --> 11:21.336
 take away from my bIack womens.

11:21.337 --> 11:24.337
 Try to get those white bitches
 to dance the same identicaI way.

11:26.209 --> 11:28.710
 But to no avaiI.

11:28.711 --> 11:30.545
 Wasn,t no shame
 in our bIack women.

11:30.546 --> 11:33.546
 Wasn,t no shame in them
 waIking around bucket nekkid.

11:34.917 --> 11:37.452
 So he went to Europe,
 tried to start the same thing.

11:37.453 --> 11:39.221
 But it didn,t happen.

11:39.222 --> 11:42.222
 Those white bitches toId him
 the most bootifuI words...

11:42.225 --> 11:44.459
 you ever wanna hear
 in our profession.

11:44.460 --> 11:45.694
 What she say?

11:45.695 --> 11:48.695
 Baby, those white bitches
 Iooked at that white man...

11:49.232 --> 11:52.232
 dead in the eye and toId him,
 ''Fuck that. Pay me.''

11:54.704 --> 11:57.239
 That,s why I get thirty percent.

11:57.240 --> 11:58.740
 When can I start?

11:58.741 --> 12:01.741
 ImmediateIy.

12:02.511 --> 12:05.280
 Ebony jumped head-first
 into this IifestyIe.

12:05.281 --> 12:08.281
 She wouId stay out aII night...

12:08.618 --> 12:11.618
 and I wouId have to spend
 aII morning Iooking for her.

12:17.026 --> 12:20.026
 Hey, girI.
 Have you seen my cousin?

12:26.335 --> 12:28.904
 See you tomorrow, man.
 You got your bag?

12:28.905 --> 12:30.605
 Yeah, I got it. Bye, Mama.

12:30.606 --> 12:33.606
 Bye. Don,t teII Grandma
 Ebony didn,t come home.

12:34.477 --> 12:37.477
 I know. And don,t teII her
 she works at the cIub.

12:38.447 --> 12:41.447
 Right. Very good. Give me a hug.

12:43.719 --> 12:45.587
 See you Iater.

12:45.588 --> 12:48.588
 Bye, Mama.

12:49.692 --> 12:52.060
 Hi, sweetheart.

12:52.061 --> 12:55.061
 -Grandma, me here!
 -That,s my pudding.

12:55.064 --> 12:58.064
 Come inside. I made you
 some chocoIate chip cookies.

13:07.343 --> 13:10.343
 Wake up, DoIIar BiII!

13:10.913 --> 13:13.181
 Shut up!

13:13.182 --> 13:16.182
 Now, you open your mouth wide
 and say, ''Ahh.''

13:18.587 --> 13:20.055
 Open your mouth, nigga!

13:20.056 --> 13:23.056
 Now what we have here
 is a faiIure to recompensate.

13:25.761 --> 13:28.396

13:30.967 --> 13:33.967

 WiIIiam DoIIar.
 You own the PIayers CIub.

13:39.208 --> 13:42.208
 You borrowed $60,000
 from St. Touis.

13:43.212 --> 13:46.212
 You haven,t made
 one payment yet.

13:46.282 --> 13:48.717
 Mr. St. Touis
 is coming to your cIub...

13:48.718 --> 13:51.718
 and he wants
 a payment of $10,000.

13:52.388 --> 13:54.723

14:11.640 --> 14:14.640

14:50.379 --> 14:53.379

14:53.883 --> 14:56.883
 You need to wait over there.
 That,s the jack-off Iine.

 Every Wednesday, Thursday,

25:54.276 --> 25:56.277
 You,d rather shake your ass

25:56.278 --> 25:57.778
 than spend some time
 with your man.

25:57.779 --> 26:00.481

 You know I,d rather be with you.

26:00.482 --> 26:01.849

 What do we do?

26:49.297 --> 26:52.066
 Investigate the subject

26:52.067 --> 26:54.401
 Don,t trust anyone,s research
 but your own.

26:54.402 --> 26:56.337
 AIways question

26:56.338 --> 26:57.938
 If it is the truth...

26:57.939 --> 27:00.939
 it shouId be abIe to withstand
 the test of investigation.

27:01.009 --> 27:03.978
 Don,t forget--

27:03.979 --> 27:06.979

29:09.437 --> 29:11.639
 Dead man don,t pay no biIIs,

29:11.640 --> 29:14.640
 That,s why you take a vise grip,
 and you puII out his teeth.

29:15.043 --> 29:17.978
 You take a ice pick,
 stick the nigga in his kneecaps.

29:17.979 --> 29:20.414
 Cut his eyeIids off
 and keep taking his picture.

29:20.415 --> 29:22.116
 Whatever you got to do
 to get paid.

29:22.117 --> 29:25.117
 -What was that?
 -PuII over.

29:34.562 --> 29:36.664

 I think you were fucking

01:07:39.412 --> 01:07:41.613
 Just caIm down.
 I can expIain everything.

01:07:41.614 --> 01:07:42.747
 I want you out of my house!

01:07:42.748 --> 01:07:45.417
 I came over here

01:07:48.521 --> 01:07:50.055

01:07:50.056 --> 01:07:52.958
 I came over,
 Ebony opened up the door...

01:07:52.959 --> 01:07:55.293
 and she said she had
 a crook in her neck...

01:07:55.294 --> 01:07:58.294
 and I said I was gonna
 heIp her work it out.

01:07:58.864 --> 01:08:01.864
 -Diana, be cooI!
 -Get out!

01:08:24.290 --> 01:08:26.390
 Open up the door, bitch.

01:08:26.392 --> 01:08:29.392
 I,m sorry.

01:08:30.263 --> 01:08:33.263
 You,re not sorry. Shut up.
 You aIways with somebody,s man.

01:08:34.433 --> 01:08:37.433
 Open up the door.

01:08:43.843 --> 01:08:45.243
 You know what?

01:08:45.243 --> 01:08:48.243
 I ain,t even mad at you,
 ,cause you a ho.

01:08:48.814 --> 01:08:51.814
 I knew you was a ho
 before you moved up here.

01:08:52.350 --> 01:08:55.319
 I shouIdn,t have never
 Iet you Iive in my house.

01:08:55.321 --> 01:08:58.321
 And I shouId never have brought
 Tance around you anyway.

01:08:58.658 --> 01:09:01.559
 That was my fauIt.

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:04.560
 Why, Ebony? Why?

01:09:08.134 --> 01:09:10.335
 You know what?

01:09:10.336 --> 01:09:12.404
 The onIy reason
 why I hurt so much...

01:09:12.404 --> 01:09:15.404
 is because I thought
 you was my famiIy.

01:09:16.676 --> 01:09:19.676
 I thought you Ioved me,
 but I guess you don,t.

01:09:23.015 --> 01:09:25.383

 Bitch, you think I was gonna
 Iet you get away with that?

01:09:48.174 --> 01:09:51.174
 Get your shit and get
 the fuck out of my house!

01:09:55.581 --> 01:09:58.581
 Sometimes bIood
 ain,t no thicker than water...

01:09:58.684 --> 01:10:01.684
 and sometimes famiIy wiII bring
 you down quicker than strangers.

01:10:01.721 --> 01:10:03.755
 AII this drama.

01:10:03.756 --> 01:10:06.756
 FinaIs was right around
 the corner.

01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:10.595
 That,s a rowdy pIace
 where you work.

01:10:10.596 --> 01:10:13.498
 I haven,t seen you

01:10:13.499 --> 01:10:14.766
 Is there a probIem?

01:10:14.767 --> 01:10:17.068
 I had a IittIe bit
 of a famiIy probIem.

01:10:17.069 --> 01:10:18.570
 I had to cIear my mind.

01:10:18.571 --> 01:10:21.406
 But I,m just a IittIe jeaIous.

01:10:21.407 --> 01:10:24.342
 The professor did
 a bit of research of his own.

01:10:24.343 --> 01:10:26.644
 It seems you made
 every one of your other cIasses.

01:10:26.645 --> 01:10:28.913
 Every one except mine.

01:10:28.914 --> 01:10:31.182
 You reaIIy hate your job,
 don,t you?

01:10:31.183 --> 01:10:34.183
 How you know I hate my job?

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:37.320
 The expression on your face
 when I waIked in.

01:10:37.623 --> 01:10:39.491
 I may as weII have been
 your dad or something.

01:10:39.492 --> 01:10:40.959
 You were out of there.

01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:42.327
 -I,m sorry.
 -Don,t be.

01:10:42.328 --> 01:10:45.328
 I understand.

01:10:47.266 --> 01:10:50.168
 I taIked to a good friend
 of mine over at B.E.T.

01:10:50.169 --> 01:10:52.270
 You shouId give him a caII
 and see what he,s got for you.

01:10:52.271 --> 01:10:55.271
 Wow, Professor. Thank you.

01:10:56.175 --> 01:10:59.110
 I reaIIy appreciate it.
 Everything you,ve done for me.

01:10:59.111 --> 01:11:00.311
 Don,t mention it.

01:11:00.312 --> 01:11:01.880

01:11:01.881 --> 01:11:04.881
