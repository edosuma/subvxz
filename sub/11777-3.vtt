especially when you have
a straight edge

and it's on a round canvas,

07:49.510 --> 07:51.470
just like when

[Dave] Tray.

08:11.490 --> 08:13.075

"Traditional.

08:14.744 --> 08:15.870
Well, you did straight lines
and curved lines.

the little details

08:24.003 --> 08:25.338

08:25.421 --> 08:26.088
I feel like, design wise,
it's a little strange,

08:26.172 --> 08:28.466
the way it fits the head.

08:29.508 --> 08:30.468
[Dave] Clint.

08:30.551 --> 08:31.761
[Chris]
The way you did the lines

08:31.844 --> 08:32.803
and the way you were able
to do rounded edges--

08:32.886 --> 08:35.347
some of it's smooth,
some of it's a little janky.

08:35.431 --> 08:38.643
But overall, the concept to do
the writing was a good idea.

08:38.726 --> 08:39.559
I tried to get fancy with it

08:39.644 --> 08:40.770
and tried
to figure out some moves.

08:40.852 --> 08:42.730
But, I mean, with hair,
I mean, it was crazy hard.

08:42.813 --> 08:44.232
<i>Mother[bleep] me.</i>

08:44.315 --> 08:45.816
{\an8}Why didn't I think of that?

08:45.900 --> 08:46.359
<i>Great.</i>
<i>Good for him.</i>

08:46.442 --> 08:48.110
[Dave] Sebastian.

08:48.194 --> 08:49.403
[Sebastian] I wanted

08:48.194 --> 08:49.403
to do the music staff.

08:49.487 --> 08:50.238
I could get a good,
Nice curved line.

08:50.321 --> 08:51.489
I can get the straight line.

08:51.572 --> 08:53.908
[Chris] Nice, solid lines
going back.

08:53.991 --> 08:55.660
And then I like
the music notes,

08:55.743 --> 08:58.120
the way you hollowed them out
to make them pop out.

08:58.204 --> 08:59.247
[Dave] Kay.

08:59.330 --> 09:02.041
Definitely not your first rodeo
with the clippers.

09:02.124 --> 09:04.252
[Oliver] The curves are nice.
Things line up well.

09:04.335 --> 09:06.587
The fade that you added to it
gives it that dimension.

09:06.671 --> 09:07.588
Looks great.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.048
{\an1}I'm trying to teach
these boys something.

09:09.131 --> 09:10.091
Class is back in session.

09:10.174 --> 09:11.968
[Dave] Nick.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.511
[Nick] Threw in
some abstract stuff.

09:13.594 --> 09:15.429
Playing with it a little bit.
Some swirls, some straight.

09:15.513 --> 09:16.639
I could play
with the whole head.

09:16.722 --> 09:17.515
It's crazy.

09:17.598 --> 09:18.140
Most of all,
it just looks terrible.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.309
Just a bad design.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.727
And it wasn't
the right thing to choose

09:21.811 --> 09:23.729
to show that you can do lines.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.399
{\an9}My design beat the hell
out of Nick's design.

09:26.482 --> 09:28.150
<i>And my ghetto past</i>
<i>is still in full effect.</i>

09:28.234 --> 09:29.318
There's no way I could lose
to a white boy

09:29.402 --> 09:31.487
in a haircut challenge,
I'm sorry.

09:31.570 --> 09:32.572
[Dave] Steve.

09:32.655 --> 09:34.073
[Steve] I started off
with a different design.

09:34.156 --> 09:35.324
And that wasn't happening.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.243
[Oliver] The design here
is just not really readable.

09:37.326 --> 09:39.954
It's hard for me to tell that
it's actually a devil skull.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.706
It doesn't really show me lines
that I can really judge.

09:43.165 --> 09:45.209
[Dave] Sarah.

09:45.293 --> 09:46.252
[Sarah] This is the first time
I've tried to do,

09:46.335 --> 09:47.503
like, a design in hair
with clippers.

09:47.586 --> 09:49.380
[Chris] These lines look
really shaky.

09:49.463 --> 09:52.091
Some of this isn't
very tight.

09:52.174 --> 09:54.385
It's almost symmetrical.

09:54.468 --> 09:55.594
{\an5}-[Dave] Jamie.

09:54.468 --> 09:55.594
-You said doing line work.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.513
I was thinking, you know,
like, pin striping,

09:57.596 --> 10:00.141
trying to get
something symmetrical.

10:00.224 --> 10:02.143
I was mostly just having trouble
getting it down to the skin.

10:02.226 --> 10:03.352
{\an1}[Oliver]
That's where you lost it.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.312
The lines are pretty
straight and smooth,

10:04.395 --> 10:07.940
but it's not too sharp
or solid.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.193
[Dave] Jesse.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.195
What is going on, dude?

10:13.279 --> 10:15.072
Dude, you just don't quit
with the teeth.

10:15.156 --> 10:16.532
[Jesse] Well, I've been
really trying

10:16.615 --> 10:18.534
to take into consideration
what you guys have been saying.

10:18.617 --> 10:19.535
You couldn't be further

10:19.618 --> 10:21.245
from hitting the mark
on the challenge.

10:21.329 --> 10:23.289
When you see a pony
do its trick,

10:23.372 --> 10:25.708
it's not really that amazing
the 20th time

10:25.791 --> 10:27.501
he does that one same trick.

10:27.585 --> 10:29.128
This is a competition, man.

10:29.211 --> 10:30.880
You gotta take
this stuff seriously.

10:31.797 --> 10:32.882
It's a tough one to call.

10:32.965 --> 10:34.175
{\an5}-[Dave] <i> Mark's was very clean.</i>

10:32.965 --> 10:34.175
-[Oliver] <i> Yeah.</i>

10:34.258 --> 10:35.343
[Dave] <i> I really liked</i>
<i>what that guy did.</i>

10:35.426 --> 10:37.428
He put the lines
in there good, real smooth.

10:37.511 --> 10:40.348
<i>Kay Kutta's looks tight.</i>
<i>Smooth, strong, solid, clean.</i>

10:40.431 --> 10:42.224
[Dave] We gotta talk
about Jesse.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.060
<i>I don't know what he's thinking.</i>

10:44.143 --> 10:45.227
<i>This is a competition,</i>

10:45.311 --> 10:46.937
<i>and he's</i> <i>[bleep] around</i>
<i>in there.</i>

10:47.021 --> 10:48.898
I think that
if he was really creative,

10:48.981 --> 10:51.233
and really this artist
that he wants to show us,

10:51.317 --> 10:52.777
then he should have done
something creative

10:52.860 --> 10:53.736
than some big googly eyes.

10:53.819 --> 10:54.570
It looks silly.

10:54.653 --> 10:56.113
Now that guy
looks like a clown.

10:56.197 --> 10:57.114
You [bleep] lose.

10:57.198 --> 10:58.699
Just last week,

10:58.783 --> 10:59.742
all three of us said,

10:59.825 --> 11:02.078
"Show us something different.
No teeth."

11:02.161 --> 11:04.205
Jesse's at the bottom.
We know that.

11:04.288 --> 11:05.373
There's a lot of people
in the middle.

11:05.456 --> 11:07.708
<i>Jamie's looks like it was just</i>
<i>hacked in there</i>

11:07.792 --> 11:08.918
<i>with a weed eater.</i>

11:09.001 --> 11:10.419
{\an1}Well, I think we've got
clear ups and downs here.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.796
{\an6}-Yeah.

11:10.503 --> 11:11.796
-What do you say?

11:11.879 --> 11:11.921
We're good.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.759
For this Flash Challenge,
we tested you on line.

11:16.842 --> 11:20.346
Some of you made the cut.
Some of you did not.

11:20.429 --> 11:21.597
Jesse, come on, man.
What was going on there?

11:21.680 --> 11:22.890
We didn't see
anything new out of you.

11:22.973 --> 11:25.768
Do you think that my lines
were the worst lines here?

11:25.851 --> 11:27.353
They were among the worst.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.689
{\an1}Jamie, out of the group,
your lines were not strong.

11:30.773 --> 11:33.192
Look a little weed whacker-ed
up a little bit.

11:33.275 --> 11:35.194
I disagree.
It was symmetrical.

11:35.277 --> 11:36.487
It was a difficult design.

11:36.570 --> 11:38.280
It wasn't my work
that was fuzzy.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.407
It was his hair.
That's [bleep] clean.

11:39.490 --> 11:40.658
It's all there.
It's solid.

11:40.741 --> 11:42.410
Maybe you should have
trimmed it down

11:42.493 --> 11:43.244
so we could see
how clean it was.

11:43.327 --> 11:45.162
Hey, it's my first
haircut, man.

11:45.246 --> 11:46.497
It was [bleep] hard,
scraping that stuff off.

11:46.580 --> 11:47.665
{\an5}-Whoa.

11:46.580 --> 11:47.665
-Wow.

11:47.748 --> 11:48.916
That's [bleep] clean.

11:48.999 --> 11:50.292
You want to bring him back in,
we can go back over it.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.169
It's too late.

11:53.629 --> 11:55.631
The judges have come
to a decision.

11:55.714 --> 11:59.135
And the winner
of the Flash Challenge is...

12:04.807 --> 12:05.975
...Kay Kutta.

12:06.058 --> 12:08.686
[applause]

12:08.769 --> 12:09.895
What we're looking at
is the lines.

12:09.979 --> 12:11.772
And it was sharp, it's crisp.
It looked good.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.607
Not only will you be able
to select your own human canvas,

12:13.691 --> 12:16.318
you will also have the power
to assign

12:16.402 --> 12:17.695
everyone else's
human canvas.

12:17.778 --> 12:20.114
Again.
So head back to the shop.

12:20.197 --> 12:22.158
Get ready to meet your canvases
for the next elimination tattoo.

12:22.241 --> 12:25.494
<i>I hope winning these two</i>
<i>Flash Challenges back-to-back</i>

12:25.578 --> 12:26.662
{\an8}is showing that I'm here
to compete.

12:26.745 --> 12:28.330
{\an8}And they need
to step their game up.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.039
<i>I'm here to rock y'all [bleep].</i>

12:29.123 --> 12:29.874
<i>Y'all better come with it.</i>

12:29.957 --> 12:32.209
'Cause I'm here
to play the game.

12:33.878 --> 12:35.254
{\an8}<i>I want to give Nick</i>
<i>a [bleep] up canvas.</i>

12:35.337 --> 12:36.839
{\an8}I just want
to see him just break.

12:36.922 --> 12:39.508
<i>He was being a bully</i>
<i>when he gave me that tattoo.</i>

12:39.592 --> 12:41.177
Can't get involved in this.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.179
Who knows what Lalo's doing,
but it's jacked.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.769
Flash Challenges ain't going
to make you an <i> Ink Master</i> .

12:50.853 --> 12:51.979
It's going to be based
on your tattooing ability.

12:52.062 --> 12:53.898
You gotta win some challenges
to get that power, though.

12:53.981 --> 12:56.609
<i>I think a lot</i>
<i>of the other competitors</i>

12:56.692 --> 12:58.694
<i>haven't realized the importance</i>
<i>of the Flash Challenges.</i>

12:58.777 --> 13:00.196
{\an8}I think that's stupid.

13:00.279 --> 13:01.655
I'm trying to get y'all
to understand.

13:01.739 --> 13:03.449
Steve got a target
on his back.

13:03.532 --> 13:04.992
Jesse got
a target on his back.

13:05.075 --> 13:07.536
Sarah got a [bleep] target
on her [bleep] back.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.412
There's a pecking order.

13:08.496 --> 13:09.914
And I don't mind
being at the bottom.

13:09.997 --> 13:10.915
That is fine with me.
I'm cool with that.

13:10.998 --> 13:13.000
'Cause from the bottom,
I can't go nowhere

13:13.083 --> 13:14.418
but towards the top.

13:14.502 --> 13:16.378
That's foolish.
That's absolutely foolish.

13:16.462 --> 13:17.922
If your tattooing is
world-class,

13:18.005 --> 13:19.965
these Flash Challenges
ain't going to matter.

13:20.049 --> 13:20.883
Please.

13:20.966 --> 13:22.635
You too old
to be that ignorant, man.

13:22.718 --> 13:24.345
You's really silly.

13:24.428 --> 13:25.930
{\an8}Keep winning these little
Flash Challenges,

13:26.013 --> 13:27.473
<i>put a little feather</i>
<i>in your hat.</i>

13:27.556 --> 13:28.933
But I tattoo.

13:29.016 --> 13:30.184
If you think
it don't mean nothing,

13:30.267 --> 13:32.019
you know,
you do what you do.

13:32.102 --> 13:33.729
<i>Steve is always</i>
<i>a sore loser.</i>

13:33.812 --> 13:35.940
{\an8}Steve is an old, whiny baby.

13:36.023 --> 13:37.650
<i>Watch your back, buddy.</i>

13:51.997 --> 13:53.290
[Dave] Congratulations, guys.

13:53.374 --> 13:55.876
You are all one step closer
to $100 thousand

13:55.960 --> 13:57.753
a feature in <i> Inked</i> <i>Magazine,</i>

13:57.836 --> 13:59.380
and the title of <i> Ink Master.</i>

13:59.463 --> 14:02.591
In this elimination tattoo,
we're testing line.

14:02.675 --> 14:03.759
<i>Lines are important</i>
<i>in tattoos</i>

14:03.842 --> 14:06.428
{\an8}to hold everything
crisp and sharp.

14:06.512 --> 14:09.098
You'll also be judged
by America.

14:09.181 --> 14:11.016
Each week, viewers at home
will scour every detail

14:11.100 --> 14:15.312
of your elimination tattoos
at inkmaster.spike.com.

14:15.396 --> 14:16.939
Then, they will vote
for the tattoo

14:17.022 --> 14:18.148
that they think is best,

14:18.232 --> 14:21.652
using the same criteria
as the judges use.

14:21.735 --> 14:22.945
Today, we have
a very special guest judge.

14:23.028 --> 14:27.366
He's been known for doing
big tattoos in one sitting.

14:27.449 --> 14:29.994
And he also happens
to be Oliver's mentor.

14:30.077 --> 14:30.411
Richard Stell.

14:30.494 --> 14:32.288
[applause]

14:32.371 --> 14:33.956
Holy [bleep].

14:34.039 --> 14:34.999
<i>I've been tattooing</i>
<i>over 30 years.</i>

14:35.082 --> 14:38.294
{\an8}My specialty is American
traditional tattooing.

14:38.377 --> 14:40.421
<i>Richard coming here</i>
<i>to be a judge</i>

14:40.504 --> 14:41.589
{\an8}is [bleep]
cool as [bleep].

14:41.672 --> 14:44.049
<i>He is a tattooer</i>
<i>in every essence of the word.</i>

14:44.133 --> 14:47.177
<i>He's the guy who taught me</i>
<i>how to tattoo.</i>

14:47.261 --> 14:49.013
{\an8}Holy [bleep].
It's [bleep] Richard Stell.

14:49.096 --> 14:50.472
<i>This guy's a legend.</i>

14:50.556 --> 14:51.515
<i>Richard Stell's been doing this</i>

14:51.599 --> 14:53.309
<i>for almost as Long</i>
<i>as I've been alive.</i>

14:53.392 --> 14:54.977
He's going
to be very, very critical.

14:55.060 --> 14:58.480
That brings us to this
week's elimination tattoo--

14:58.564 --> 14:58.981
American traditional.

15:01.775 --> 15:03.402
<i>I'm not excited about</i>
<i>an American traditional piece.</i>

15:03.485 --> 15:05.779
{\an8}There's a lot of rules.

15:05.863 --> 15:09.116
{\an8}And Oliver knows those rules
and I don't.

15:09.199 --> 15:10.993
American traditional
tattoos are known

15:11.076 --> 15:13.912
for their bold, solid outlines
and limited palette.

15:13.996 --> 15:16.373
<i>Twenty years ago,</i>
<i>when I started tattooing,</i>

15:16.457 --> 15:18.459
{\an8}what people consider
traditional today

15:18.542 --> 15:20.002
{\an8}was an everyday tattoo
for us.

15:20.085 --> 15:22.588
[Dave] Your tattoo May include
any elements you like.

15:22.671 --> 15:25.924
However, it must include
an eagle and a flag.

15:26.008 --> 15:27.509
<i>Actually having</i>
<i>an eagle and a flag</i>

15:27.593 --> 15:29.803
<i>levels the playing field.</i>

15:29.887 --> 15:32.139
{\an8}Now everybody has to deal
with the same subject matter,

15:32.222 --> 15:34.058
<i>so you'll be able to see</i>
<i>their interpretation</i>

15:34.141 --> 15:34.725
<i>of American traditional.</i>

15:34.808 --> 15:37.227
Let's meet your canvases.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.693
All of the canvases this week
are military veterans.

15:46.070 --> 15:47.029
Thanks for joining us.

15:47.112 --> 15:48.864
And thank you very much
for your service.

15:49.948 --> 15:51.909
Kay, because you won
the Flash Challenge,

15:51.992 --> 15:55.037
you now, once again,
get to choose which artist

15:55.120 --> 15:56.664
will be tattooing
each canvas.

15:56.747 --> 15:57.665
Choose wisely.

15:57.748 --> 15:59.917
$100 thousand is on the line.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.460
{\an8}Kay has always got
a strategy for something.

16:01.543 --> 16:03.462
Let's try something new.

16:03.545 --> 16:04.713
Since I've done this
more than once.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.132
<i>What that strategy is</i>
<i>or whether it's a good strategy</i>

16:07.216 --> 16:10.135
is hard to say,
but he's a schemer for sure.

16:10.219 --> 16:12.054
Certain name I'm looking for
real quick.

16:12.137 --> 16:14.098
Oh.

16:14.098 --> 16:15.808
Somebody pissed
the big man off.

16:15.891 --> 16:17.393
Nice.

16:17.476 --> 16:18.936
I want to give Nick
a [bleep] up canvas.

16:19.019 --> 16:21.397
{\an8}I just want to see him
under pressure and just break.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.189
What do you want to get?

16:22.272 --> 16:24.817
American soldier
holding an M4.

16:24.900 --> 16:25.984
What do you want to get?

16:26.068 --> 16:27.778
I want to get
a horseshoe and a hand grenade.

16:27.861 --> 16:28.362
In American traditional style?

16:28.445 --> 16:30.614
Absolutely.

16:30.698 --> 16:33.492
<i>I give Steve the most</i>
<i>[bleep] up canvas out there.</i>

16:33.575 --> 16:35.077
Because I'm just tired
of his mouth.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.829
<i>I just want him</i>
<i>to shut up and go home.</i>

16:36.912 --> 16:37.913
What kind of tattoo
you want?

16:37.996 --> 16:39.206
An American eagle
portrayed as a soldier.

16:40.833 --> 16:41.917
{\an5}-Is that so?

16:40.833 --> 16:41.917
-Affirmative.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.129
{\an3}Nick, I'm about to give you
a bad position right now.

16:45.212 --> 16:46.130
There you go.

16:46.213 --> 16:47.172
<i>Go ahead and take this canvas.</i>

16:47.256 --> 16:48.465
Let me see
what you do with this.

16:49.341 --> 16:50.634
What kind of tattoo
you want to get?

16:50.718 --> 16:51.760
I want to get a 50 cal round

16:51.844 --> 16:53.762
that says, "One shot can change
the world" on it.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.265
Yes, sir.
Oh, I believe you, too.

16:56.348 --> 16:58.058
You're not going to be wavered
from that, right?

16:58.142 --> 17:00.769
{\an5}-No.

16:58.142 --> 17:00.769
-Don't let me down, soldier.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.604
I never let anyone down.

17:03.272 --> 17:04.189
There you go.

17:04.272 --> 17:05.357
What kind of tattoo
you want to get?

17:05.441 --> 17:08.109
I'd like you
to ink your artistic version

17:08.193 --> 17:09.944
of the United States
Marine Corps emblem

17:10.028 --> 17:11.405
on my upper left arm.

17:11.488 --> 17:13.781
{\an5}-You would like me to do it?

17:11.488 --> 17:13.781
-I said that.

17:14.782 --> 17:16.952
Did I just hear
what I thought I heard?

17:17.035 --> 17:19.872
<i>I kind of hit a brick wall</i>
<i>and the tables got turned on me.</i>

17:19.954 --> 17:20.914
<i>My canvas chose me.</i>

17:20.998 --> 17:22.750
I'm going to do it for you, sir.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.667
{\an7}The one thing you control
is the canvas that you get.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.045
{\an8}And the canvas picked him.

17:27.128 --> 17:28.630
<i>That advantage is gone.</i>

17:28.714 --> 17:29.715
Thank you.

17:30.924 --> 17:32.050
Very good.

17:32.134 --> 17:33.218
<i>Kay did not have a choice</i>
<i>to choose that guy.</i>

17:33.302 --> 17:34.887
{\an8}If Kay didn't do that, he would
have looked like a punk.

17:34.970 --> 17:37.431
<i>You ain't playing games</i>
<i>anymore.</i>

17:37.848 --> 17:39.933
Thank you.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.770
Canvases, one by one,
please reveal the name

17:42.853 --> 17:44.438
on the bottom of your skull.

17:44.521 --> 17:45.481
Clint.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.316
{\an5}-Lalo.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.316
-Mark.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.318
{\an5}-Ron.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.318
-Kay.

17:49.401 --> 17:50.652
{\an5}-Sarah.

17:49.401 --> 17:50.652
-Jamie.

17:50.736 --> 17:53.739
{\an5}-Jesse.

17:50.736 --> 17:53.739
-Big daddy Tray.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.574
Steve.

17:56.825 --> 17:59.411
Kay kutta's given me
the hand grenade tattoo.

17:59.495 --> 18:00.829
{\an8}Which is the one I wanted.
So, thanks, bro.

18:00.913 --> 18:01.914
{\an8}I appreciate that.

18:01.997 --> 18:03.248
Tatu baby.

18:04.166 --> 18:05.125
Sebastian.

18:05.209 --> 18:07.044
{\an5}-Nick.

18:05.209 --> 18:07.044
-Done deal, then.

18:07.127 --> 18:09.546
{\an9}This is nerve-wracking.
I got the worst pick.

18:09.630 --> 18:10.464
You guys have the rest
of the evening

18:10.547 --> 18:13.258
to consult
with your human canvases.

18:13.342 --> 18:15.010
Tomorrow, six hours
to complete

18:15.093 --> 18:16.178
your American traditional
tattoo.

18:16.261 --> 18:19.973
Based on your work,
one of you will be going home.

18:20.057 --> 18:20.098
Good luck.

18:22.392 --> 18:24.978
<i>I just love traditional</i>
<i>American tattooing.</i>

18:25.062 --> 18:28.524
{\an8}To me, it's the heart and soul
of why I became a tattooer.

18:28.607 --> 18:31.860
<i>A bold, clean line,</i>
<i>smooth shading, bright color,</i>

18:31.944 --> 18:34.404
easily readable design.

18:34.488 --> 18:35.697
I've always liked

18:35.781 --> 18:37.199
how the eagle kind of tears
the skin.

18:37.282 --> 18:40.869
So the ship's name was?
USS Little Rock.

18:40.953 --> 18:41.703
Little Rock?

18:41.787 --> 18:42.871
Just like Little Rock,
Arkansas.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.039
Well, I have
to be honest with you.

18:44.122 --> 18:46.125
This is not American
traditional.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.710
So it's, like,
a three-step process.

18:48.794 --> 18:49.878
First I gotta find it.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.381
Then I gotta, you know,
make sure that it's drawn right.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.883
And then I gotta flatten it
and make it traditional.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.134
<i>American traditional,</i>
<i>to me,</i>

18:56.218 --> 18:58.220
<i>as beautiful</i>
<i>and as technical as it is,</i>

18:58.303 --> 18:59.555
{\an8}it's still third grade.

18:59.638 --> 19:01.682
I could draw it really good
and draw it really bad.

19:01.765 --> 19:03.642
<i>I'm smoking cigarettes</i>
<i>and hanging out</i>

19:03.725 --> 19:05.060
with the bad people
in the tenth grade.

19:05.144 --> 19:07.229
I gotta get through this one
in order to get

19:07.312 --> 19:08.647
to the next challenge,
where I'm gonna have

19:08.730 --> 19:10.232
an opportunity
to really show off my skills.

19:10.315 --> 19:15.362
So a soldier as an eagle,
in combat gear.

19:15.445 --> 19:17.656
<i>Kay was being a bully</i>
<i>when he gave me that tattoo.</i>

19:17.739 --> 19:18.740
{\an8}I think he's just
a little scared

19:18.824 --> 19:20.659
{\an8}that some 22-year-old
is gonna spank him

19:20.742 --> 19:21.577
{\an8}in one of these competitions.

19:21.660 --> 19:24.079
He gave me this for a reason.
He's mad.

19:24.163 --> 19:27.082
He talks [bleep] about everybody
and I just don't take it.

19:27.165 --> 19:28.792
I'm used to it, though.
Got picked on my whole life, so.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.712
You should join the army.

19:31.795 --> 19:32.754
{\an5}-I'll be 80 years old.

19:31.795 --> 19:32.754
{\an1}-Okay.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.423
And this will be
a good birthday present for me.

19:34.506 --> 19:37.426
{\an5}-Yes, it will.

19:34.506 --> 19:37.426
-I've never had a tattoo.

19:37.509 --> 19:40.012
{\an8}Virgin canvas.

19:40.095 --> 19:44.057
He's a virgin, on top of having
80-year-old skin.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.601
Have you ever done
an eagle, globe, and anchor?

19:45.684 --> 19:47.185
I've done plenty.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.646
But this particular challenge,
I have strict restraints.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.148
<i>One of the things</i>
<i>you don't want to get</i>

19:51.231 --> 19:54.443
{\an8}is a tattoo virgin.
Number two is an older client.

19:54.526 --> 19:56.987
<i>Just because of the delicacy</i>
<i>of their skin.</i>

19:57.070 --> 19:58.447
Kay could be in trouble
on this one.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.781
<i>Well, this is the worst</i>
<i>case scenario, here.</i>

19:59.865 --> 20:01.909
{\an8}This is so bad.

20:08.832 --> 20:11.001
I've never done
American traditional before.

20:11.084 --> 20:12.878
So I don't know
how long it takes.

20:12.961 --> 20:13.837
I got my stomach going,
"Oh, boy."

20:13.921 --> 20:16.048
These [bleep] kids, man.

20:16.131 --> 20:17.382
-I know.
They're panicky.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.801
Running around like chickens
with their head cut off.

20:19.885 --> 20:21.762
Sweating their
traditional tattoo.

20:21.845 --> 20:24.473
<i>The most simple design</i>
<i>you could lay out.</i>

20:24.556 --> 20:26.642
{\an8}Oh, American traditional.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.727
<i>I mean, I have a lot</i>
<i>of respect for it.</i>

20:28.810 --> 20:31.146
I also have a lot of respect
for vegans.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.481
But I love me some bacon.

20:32.564 --> 20:34.316
I mean, what the [bleep]
do you want?

20:34.399 --> 20:38.278
If you can tattoo,
you can do a traditional tattoo.

20:38.362 --> 20:41.865
You have six hours to tattoo
an American traditional design

20:41.949 --> 20:44.701
that includes an eagle
and a flag.

20:44.785 --> 20:46.703
Remember, we're testing you
on line.

20:46.787 --> 20:49.456
Your time starts now.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.417
Let's do this, man.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.670
Does it bulge
when I bulge my muscle?

20:54.753 --> 20:58.131
Looks like the eagle's
about to fly right now.

20:58.215 --> 21:00.008
{\an8}We want to see
that you can do clean line work.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.177
<i>And the American traditional</i>
<i>is perfect for that.</i>

21:02.260 --> 21:03.303
<i>It's simple and clean.</i>

21:03.387 --> 21:05.847
<i>And your lines are going</i>
<i>to stand out.</i>

21:05.931 --> 21:07.724
{\an5}<i>-How does that look?</i>

21:05.931 --> 21:07.724
<i>-Hell, yeah.</i>

21:07.808 --> 21:09.518
I'm thinking about going
on the side.

21:09.601 --> 21:11.812
Thinking
about going on the side?

21:11.895 --> 21:13.563
{\an8}Once the canvas suggested
that he wants to do this

21:13.647 --> 21:15.148
{\an8}on the ribs,
I was a little bit worried.

21:15.232 --> 21:17.067
{\an8}Because that's one
of those areas that is iffy.

21:17.150 --> 21:19.695
How'd you sit
for that first one?

21:19.778 --> 21:20.988
That's fine.
I'll-I'll be good.

21:21.071 --> 21:22.489
{\an5}-Sure?

21:21.071 --> 21:22.489
-Positive.

21:22.572 --> 21:24.324
<i>Now, we're under</i>
<i>time constraints.</i>

21:24.408 --> 21:26.451
<i>And I have the pressure</i>
<i>of doing lines</i>

21:26.535 --> 21:28.036
<i>on the lower rib cage.</i>

21:28.120 --> 21:30.789
Which is going
to be a pain in the ass.

21:32.791 --> 21:34.668
Alright, you about
to show all of America

21:34.751 --> 21:35.961
it's never too late.

21:36.044 --> 21:37.087
[laughs]

21:41.508 --> 21:44.428
<i>In this competition,</i>
<i>they're looking for clean lines,</i>

21:44.511 --> 21:48.056
smooth shading,
and a simplified color palette

21:48.140 --> 21:50.225
{\an8}to go with
the American traditional theme.

21:50.308 --> 21:52.602
You picked a good guy
to do this tattoo.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.855
Because I tattoo at Fort Knox.

21:54.938 --> 21:57.190
All I do is, like,
military guys, every day.

21:57.274 --> 21:58.442
Day in and day out.

21:58.525 --> 22:00.277
{\an5}-Cool.

21:58.525 --> 22:00.277
-Eagles, flags.

22:00.360 --> 22:02.195
A lot of the guys in here

22:02.279 --> 22:04.531
have no idea, when it comes
to traditional.

22:05.866 --> 22:07.784
Three hours, guys.
Halfway there.

22:14.374 --> 22:15.792
This challenge
is just frustrating.

22:15.876 --> 22:17.502
It's [bleep].

22:19.588 --> 22:21.131
<i>I could be over-thinking it.</i>

22:21.214 --> 22:23.884
They keep pushing in my head
this is a line challenge.

22:23.967 --> 22:25.510
If I give you a [bleep]
load of lines

22:25.594 --> 22:27.095
in all different shapes,
sizes, and colors,

22:27.179 --> 22:28.138
then there you go.

22:28.221 --> 22:30.098
Think you're gonna finish
this thing alright?

22:30.182 --> 22:32.809
I need to stop doing
a Russian outline on here,

22:32.893 --> 22:36.605
especially since that's what
we're being critiqued on.

22:36.688 --> 22:40.275
Where did you come up
with the reds on this one here?

22:40.358 --> 22:41.902
It's not
a realistic description

22:41.985 --> 22:43.737
of the American flag.

22:44.446 --> 22:45.697
Lalo is doing a flag

22:45.781 --> 22:48.408
that's [bleep] anything
but an American flag.

22:48.492 --> 22:50.535
{\an8}He is showing
that he is not an American.

22:51.369 --> 22:53.997
This is red.
Right?

22:54.081 --> 22:56.124
{\an4}-Go on.

22:54.081 --> 22:56.124
-And ends up red here.

22:56.208 --> 22:57.501
I mean, of course
it's not a realistic--

22:57.584 --> 22:59.127
{\an1}We would have
to fold it out--

22:59.211 --> 23:00.128
Yeah.
But let me talk.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.922
I let you talk.
Let me talk.

23:02.005 --> 23:03.381
I just want the lines
to match up.

23:03.465 --> 23:06.134
You do the flag
the way it goes down.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.261
Which is right?
His or this?

23:08.345 --> 23:09.679
I can't get involved in this.

23:09.763 --> 23:12.474
If you have a guy
who's an American patriot,

23:12.557 --> 23:13.266
<i>he wants an American flag.</i>

23:13.350 --> 23:15.560
<i>Who knows what Lalo's doing.</i>

23:15.644 --> 23:17.145
But it's not an American flag.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.146
And it's jacked.

23:18.230 --> 23:19.314
You're the one who has
to walk with this

23:19.397 --> 23:20.315
for the rest of your life.

23:20.398 --> 23:21.525
{\an5}-Yes, I do.

23:20.398 --> 23:21.525
-It's up to you.

23:23.568 --> 23:24.820
If we were in the '60s
right now,

23:24.903 --> 23:25.987
and you stepped off a boat

23:26.071 --> 23:26.822
and got a tattoo
and then got back on

23:26.905 --> 23:28.740
and went on active duty
as a sailor,

23:28.824 --> 23:30.784
that's what I want your tattoo
to look like.

23:30.867 --> 23:32.160
What've we got here?

23:32.244 --> 23:33.537
I started shading this thing

23:33.620 --> 23:34.913
and I just couldn't help
but smile.

23:34.996 --> 23:36.248
Because I've never
done it before.

23:36.331 --> 23:37.874
And it's the most fun
that I've ever had.

23:37.958 --> 23:39.042
I'm really astounded.

23:39.126 --> 23:41.670
'Cause it's, like, the coolest
thing I've ever done.

23:41.753 --> 23:43.839
Just because
it's traditional and simple,

23:43.922 --> 23:45.132
<i>doesn't mean it should be</i>
<i>silly or cartoony.</i>

23:45.215 --> 23:47.801
<i>If you over-fluff it</i>

23:47.884 --> 23:49.386
and try
to put too much detail in it,

23:49.469 --> 23:52.430
it just crowds it up
and you end up with a blob.

23:53.014 --> 23:55.934
One hour remaining.

24:01.148 --> 24:02.941
You're doing well.

24:03.024 --> 24:03.859
<i>His skin is doing</i>
<i>some funny things.</i>

24:03.942 --> 24:05.694
{\an8}The needle hits,

24:05.777 --> 24:07.279
{\an8}and you gotta get a burst of ink

24:07.362 --> 24:08.196
{\an8}in certain places.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.739
{\an8}Kay's lines
are extremely crooked.

24:09.823 --> 24:12.409
<i>His red stripe is touching</i>
<i>the blue on the flag.</i>

24:12.492 --> 24:14.953
His 80-year-old veteran client
is going to hate that.

24:15.036 --> 24:17.122
<i>Kay should be booted</i>
<i>out of the house.</i>

24:18.957 --> 24:20.917
{\an3}<i>My canvas' pain tolerance</i>
<i>is sinking and sinking,</i>

24:21.001 --> 24:23.044
really, really fast.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.841
Those are words that
you really don't want to hear

24:27.924 --> 24:28.925
when you're tattooing.

24:29.009 --> 24:31.386
Almost there, man.
Almost there.

24:31.469 --> 24:33.722
I wipe away, and that line's
got a little bump in it.

24:33.805 --> 24:35.390
The flag is the only wonky part
that I got.

24:35.473 --> 24:37.017
I'm just hoping that somebody
else [bleep]ed up

24:37.100 --> 24:38.393
worse than I did.

24:38.476 --> 24:39.519
{\an5}-[Dave] Ten.

24:38.476 --> 24:39.519
-Oh, [bleep].

24:39.603 --> 24:44.399
[Dave] Nine, eight, seven,
six, five,

24:44.482 --> 24:48.028
four, three, two, one.

24:48.111 --> 24:50.739
Time's up.
Machines down.

24:50.822 --> 24:52.073
No more ink.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.284
That's fantastic.

24:54.367 --> 24:56.703
I'm so happy with this.
Like, you don't even understand.

24:56.786 --> 24:57.913
Nice, huh?

24:57.996 --> 24:59.623
<i>I feel like a lot</i>
<i>of these artists didn't really</i>

24:59.706 --> 25:01.374
put their hearts
in these tattoos.

25:01.458 --> 25:02.834
<i>'Cause they don't really</i>
<i>respect the style</i>

25:02.918 --> 25:04.085
<i>of traditional tattooing.</i>

25:04.169 --> 25:06.755
So I feel real confident today
that I'll be in the top.

25:06.838 --> 25:08.632
The way you did it, man,
it's--

25:08.715 --> 25:11.009
It's respectful.
It's-- it's tight.

25:11.092 --> 25:12.427
<i>By putting the snake</i>
<i>and dagger in the tattoo,</i>

25:12.510 --> 25:15.222
I'm trying
to do kind of risky things

25:15.305 --> 25:17.807
that are a little bit different
so the judges go, "Wow."

25:17.891 --> 25:19.601
Nick thinks
he knows everything.

25:19.684 --> 25:22.062
And he's just a young,
stupid idiot.

25:22.145 --> 25:25.148
<i>What the [bleep] is he doing</i>
<i>with this blue [bleep]?</i>

25:25.232 --> 25:27.359
<i>This is old school,</i>
<i>not new school.</i>

25:27.442 --> 25:28.610
Fool.

25:31.613 --> 25:33.031
{\an8}You're weak, you're weak.

25:33.114 --> 25:34.282
{\an8}-Okay.

25:33.114 --> 25:34.282
{\an8}-You're definitely weak.

25:34.366 --> 25:35.283
You mean nothing to me.

25:35.367 --> 25:36.534
This is the last time
I'm gonna say this.

25:36.618 --> 25:37.244
{\an5}-[bleep] nothing.

25:36.618 --> 25:37.244
-I'm a [bleep] predator.

25:37.327 --> 25:38.787
This is disrespectful.

25:38.870 --> 25:46.211
How do you walk in to
this competition not prepared?

25:46.294 --> 25:48.546
Hey, Clint.
I gotta ask you.

25:48.630 --> 25:50.548
Why did you sculpt
your lines, bro?

25:50.632 --> 25:51.967
You know that's not
a traditional tattoo.

25:52.050 --> 25:53.134
I wanted to show them

25:53.218 --> 25:54.177
that there's more than one way
to do a line.

25:54.261 --> 25:56.596
This was all about lines.

25:56.680 --> 25:58.723
{\an1}So, in your head, you did
a traditional tattoo today?

25:58.807 --> 26:01.393
All bull-[bleep] aside?
Or did you do a Clint piece?

26:01.476 --> 26:03.645
I don't know if I gave them
American traditional.

26:03.728 --> 26:06.940
{\an8}That's like you coming to me
asking me for an apple pie.

26:07.023 --> 26:08.108
<i>I've eaten</i>
<i>a [bleep] apple pie.</i>

26:08.191 --> 26:09.818
Doesn't mean I know how to
make a [bleep] Apple pie.

26:09.901 --> 26:11.987
<i>So I'm just going to go ahead</i>
<i>and smash up</i>

26:12.070 --> 26:13.655
<i>a bunch of [bleep] apples,</i>
<i>stick it in the oven,</i>

26:13.738 --> 26:15.407
<i>and whatever [bleep] comes out</i>
<i>is what you're going to get.</i>

26:15.490 --> 26:18.159
That's basically this tattoo
in a nutshell.

26:18.243 --> 26:19.786
Know what?
If they want to send my ass home

26:19.869 --> 26:21.663
because I did
really badass lines

26:21.746 --> 26:23.331
and then I sculpted them,

26:23.415 --> 26:24.666
[bleep] it.

26:45.103 --> 26:47.439
This week, we went old school
and had you tattoo

26:47.522 --> 26:50.525
an American traditional design
with an eagle and a flag,

26:50.608 --> 26:52.444
giving us similar elements
to judge.

26:52.527 --> 26:52.777
We're testing you on line.

26:53.987 --> 26:56.031
Clint.

26:56.781 --> 26:57.824
When we picked
these challenges,

26:57.907 --> 27:00.785
and the reason American
traditional for outline

27:00.869 --> 27:01.703
because it's simple.

27:01.786 --> 27:03.288
Plenty of room for us
to just see

27:03.371 --> 27:05.040
your quality of line work.

27:05.123 --> 27:06.791
<i>You didn't need</i>
<i>to bold these lines up.</i>

27:06.875 --> 27:08.793
<i>You bolded a lot of these up</i>
<i>big time.</i>

27:08.877 --> 27:10.086
<i>Some of the lines in here</i>

27:10.170 --> 27:12.213
<i>are exactly</i>
<i>what we're looking for.</i>

27:12.297 --> 27:13.757
You went a little overboard
and spent way too much time

27:13.840 --> 27:15.967
showing us that you can do stuff
we weren't looking for.

27:16.051 --> 27:17.802
<i>The helmet and the bullets</i>
<i>and the skull,</i>

27:17.886 --> 27:19.054
<i>that's pretty much</i>
<i>what it should have been.</i>

27:19.137 --> 27:20.889
<i>If the rest of the tattoo</i>
<i>looked just like that,</i>

27:20.972 --> 27:24.934
<i>you'd have yourself more</i>
<i>a traditional-looking tattoo.</i>

27:25.018 --> 27:26.561
I think that I, uh,
overshot logic.

27:26.644 --> 27:28.605
Just did things that
I shouldn't have done.

27:28.688 --> 27:32.025
A big part of this game is
understanding the challenge.

27:32.108 --> 27:34.819
I'd hate to see somebody go home
before they get a chance

27:34.903 --> 27:35.779
to really show us,

27:35.862 --> 27:37.280
because they made
the wrong decision.

27:39.491 --> 27:40.533
Sebastian.

27:42.827 --> 27:44.120
I really like this.

27:44.204 --> 27:45.997
<i>It's rough, it's tough,</i>
<i>it's not prissy.</i>

27:46.081 --> 27:47.123
And then I noticed something.

27:47.207 --> 27:49.250
What do you think I noticed?

27:49.334 --> 27:51.002
It's flying backwards
on that guy's arm.

27:51.086 --> 27:52.504
The head's supposed
to point out?

27:52.587 --> 27:53.588
If I have subject matter
and I have a face here,

27:53.671 --> 27:55.715
do I want it
looking at my ass?

27:55.799 --> 27:57.092
Or do I want it
staring at my enemy?

27:57.175 --> 27:58.510
<i>You want it looking forward.</i>

27:58.593 --> 27:59.928
<i>You don't want it</i>
<i>looking backwards.</i>

28:00.011 --> 28:01.971
The ass-backward eagle
is a toughie.

28:02.806 --> 28:04.140
Jamie.

28:04.224 --> 28:06.726
Overall, the line weight
of the size of the tattoo

28:06.810 --> 28:07.852
is a little thin.

28:07.936 --> 28:09.521
<i>There's a few weak lines</i>
<i>in this tattoo.</i>

28:09.604 --> 28:11.231
<i>Like the top</i>
<i>of the eagle's wing</i>

28:11.314 --> 28:12.857
<i>and some of the banner.</i>

28:12.941 --> 28:14.359
<i>One of my biggest complaints</i>
<i>about this</i>

28:14.442 --> 28:16.027
<i>is the lettering up top.</i>

28:16.111 --> 28:17.821
Little Rock is two words.

28:18.738 --> 28:19.739
Not on the ship, though.

28:19.823 --> 28:20.907
It wasn't Little Rock, Arkansas.

28:20.990 --> 28:21.950
It was "Littlerock."
And it was all one word.

28:22.033 --> 28:23.660
I checked it with him
and I double checked it.

28:23.743 --> 28:26.996
Every battleship and cruiser
and aircraft carrier

28:27.080 --> 28:28.206
<i>is named after a city.</i>

28:28.289 --> 28:29.416
<i>And the ship</i>
<i>is definitely named</i>

28:29.499 --> 28:32.460
after the city
Little Rock, Arkansas.

28:32.544 --> 28:33.753
I went with what he said.

28:33.837 --> 28:36.631
<i>If the guy told you</i>
<i>he wanted it all in one word,</i>

28:36.714 --> 28:37.882
<i>then that is fine.</i>

28:37.966 --> 28:40.176
But it's definitely two words.

28:41.553 --> 28:43.680
Tatu baby.

28:43.763 --> 28:45.974
I always get nervous
when I'm up here.

28:46.057 --> 28:46.724
{\an8}[Richard] <i> There's a lot</i>
<i>of problems here.</i>

28:46.808 --> 28:48.810
{\an8}<i>The real thing is that rope.</i>

28:48.893 --> 28:50.353
<i>And it's really kind of beat.</i>

28:50.437 --> 28:53.940
You gave yourself
a very difficult tattoo to do.

28:54.023 --> 28:57.152
<i>That rope done really, really</i>
<i>well would have added to it.</i>

28:57.235 --> 28:58.778
But the rope done bad
really takes away from it.

29:00.655 --> 29:02.532
There's execution problems.

29:04.033 --> 29:05.243
Mark.

29:07.078 --> 29:09.664
A few little elements
would have really

29:09.747 --> 29:11.207
<i>knocked this thing up a lot.</i>

29:11.291 --> 29:12.876
<i>The flag is very minimalistic.</i>

29:12.959 --> 29:14.836
<i>I have to point out</i>
<i>that a lot of you did</i>

29:14.919 --> 29:16.921
<i>the red stripe next to the blue,</i>

29:17.005 --> 29:20.216
which is supposed
to be red, white, and blue.

29:20.300 --> 29:21.301
That was a pressure moment.

29:21.384 --> 29:22.760
I crumbled a little bit
right there.

29:22.844 --> 29:24.179
[Oliver] No margin for error.

29:24.262 --> 29:25.388
That's where you lost it.

29:27.098 --> 29:28.391
Sarah.

29:28.475 --> 29:30.768
You did a lot of really nice
lines in this tattoo.

29:30.852 --> 29:32.562
<i>And some smooth shading.</i>

29:32.645 --> 29:35.398
The flag shape
is a little weird and stiff.

29:35.482 --> 29:38.151
<i>But I do appreciate</i>
<i>that the stripes are correct.</i>

29:38.234 --> 29:40.236
<i>You're not standing out</i>
<i>in the lead of the pack.</i>

29:40.320 --> 29:43.156
But I don't think you're falling
at the bottom, either.

29:44.157 --> 29:46.409
Jesse.

29:46.493 --> 29:48.077
This is the most humbling
tattoo I've done

29:48.161 --> 29:49.329
<i>in my entire career.</i>

29:49.412 --> 29:51.498
<i>I just never realized</i>
<i>how difficult it was.</i>

29:51.581 --> 29:54.292
This is probably the worst
eagle head that we've seen.

29:55.710 --> 29:57.128
You specialize in animals.

29:57.212 --> 29:59.047
If you looked at an eagle,
then you would know

29:59.130 --> 30:00.507
<i>that it doesn't look like this.</i>

30:00.590 --> 30:02.133
<i>It's not a realistic tattoo.</i>

30:02.217 --> 30:03.718
<i>But it's still supposed</i>
<i>to look like what it is.</i>

30:03.801 --> 30:05.845
A lot of people talk
about traditional

30:05.929 --> 30:07.555
like they think it's so simple,
and that's not the case.

30:07.639 --> 30:09.849
The simpler the design,

30:09.933 --> 30:12.310
the harder it is
to do it just right.

30:13.394 --> 30:13.895
Ron, step right up.

30:15.980 --> 30:17.273
[Chris] This is a rough tattoo.

30:17.357 --> 30:20.360
<i>Putting that dark color</i>
<i>behind the darkness of the eagle</i>

30:20.443 --> 30:22.612
just makes mud.

30:22.695 --> 30:23.613
Eagle is black.
You don't need to put black

30:23.696 --> 30:26.449
in the background
of a black eagle.

30:26.533 --> 30:28.243
The flag's just jacked.

30:28.326 --> 30:30.870
<i>The way that the area</i>
<i>where the stars are bends,</i>

30:30.954 --> 30:33.665
<i>no way in hell that wouldn't</i>
<i>be stars on the other side.</i>

30:33.748 --> 30:34.624
It's the same on both sides.

30:34.707 --> 30:36.668
Not a good tattoo, man.

30:38.836 --> 30:39.629
Tray.

30:39.712 --> 30:41.047
How was this process for you?

30:41.130 --> 30:42.549
I felt a little more confident

30:42.632 --> 30:43.716
<i>because it's something I do</i>
<i>on a regular basis.</i>

30:43.800 --> 30:45.677
[Richard]
<i>There's some real problems</i>

30:45.760 --> 30:46.970
<i>with the anatomy of the eagle.</i>

30:47.053 --> 30:48.137
<i>The wings,</i>
<i>one's coming out of the neck.</i>

30:48.221 --> 30:51.599
<i>And the other one is coming out</i>
<i>of the lower back.</i>

30:51.683 --> 30:53.601
Well, I went by a reference
I found on the internet.

30:53.685 --> 30:54.602
But you can't see?

30:54.686 --> 30:56.271
You tell me
where that wing comes from.

30:56.354 --> 30:58.606
This whole entire thing,
it's like,

30:58.690 --> 31:00.024
the wing goes this way,
broke the body this way.

31:00.108 --> 31:03.069
Broke the legs and positioned
them wherever the [bleep].

31:03.152 --> 31:05.738
There's no way.
It's brutal.

31:08.116 --> 31:08.992
Lalo.

31:09.534 --> 31:11.786
I do a lot of birds.

31:11.869 --> 31:12.537
<i>So I was actually afraid that</i>
<i>that was going to affect</i>

31:12.620 --> 31:14.789
<i>the way I did the eagle.</i>

31:14.872 --> 31:16.249
<i>'Cause maybe I was going</i>
<i>to get too technical.</i>

31:16.332 --> 31:18.084
My favorite eagle.
Out of the bunch.

31:18.167 --> 31:19.460
Thank you.

31:19.544 --> 31:21.754
Man, what the [bleep]
with this flag.

31:21.838 --> 31:23.965
Five stars, seven stripes.

31:24.048 --> 31:24.799
It's an impossible twist.

31:24.882 --> 31:27.010
It's not a realistic thing,
so--

31:27.093 --> 31:28.636
It's not possible.

31:28.720 --> 31:29.345
You're drawing
an American flag.

31:29.429 --> 31:31.431
It should resemble it.

31:31.514 --> 31:33.600
<i>All these things</i>

31:36.352 --> 31:38.313
<i>I can't get over the flag.</i>
<i>On a vet.</i>

31:38.396 --> 31:39.689
This guy's put his life
on the line

31:39.772 --> 31:41.733
for this blanket of freedom.

31:41.816 --> 31:42.692
I'd have been scared
of that guy

31:42.775 --> 31:45.403
ripping my [bleep]
throat out.

31:46.237 --> 31:47.363
Steve.

31:47.447 --> 31:49.073
A lot of things about it
look just right.

31:49.157 --> 31:50.033
<i>A couple things about it</i>
<i>look a little off.</i>

31:50.116 --> 31:51.242
{\an1}[Richard]
<i>Eagle's a little strange.</i>

31:51.326 --> 31:53.369
<i>I can't figure where</i>
<i>its wings are coming from</i>

31:53.453 --> 31:55.496
somewhere near the tail,
looks like.

31:55.580 --> 31:56.748
The grenade
looks a little bit

31:56.831 --> 31:57.999
like a Japanese lantern,
a little.

31:58.082 --> 31:58.666
{\an3}[Steve] <i> He wanted</i>
<i>a certain hand grenade.</i>

31:58.750 --> 31:59.500
<i>And how to simplify it--</i>

31:59.584 --> 32:01.628
<i>I messed around with the design,</i>

32:01.711 --> 32:03.504
<i>then I started losing</i>
<i>the grenade.</i>

32:03.588 --> 32:04.505
It just, you know.

32:04.589 --> 32:05.757
It is my job to tell you
what I think is right

32:05.840 --> 32:07.175
and what is wrong.

32:07.258 --> 32:08.926
<i>When I look at this tattoo,</i>
<i>I like it, right off the bat.</i>

32:09.010 --> 32:10.178
<i>So that's a good start.</i>

32:12.180 --> 32:13.097
Kay.

32:16.893 --> 32:18.645
[Kay] <i> My canvas was</i>
<i>an 80-year-old</i> <i>tattoo virgin.</i>

32:18.728 --> 32:20.855
<i>So I had to keep it small.</i>

32:20.938 --> 32:22.231
As far as judging lines,

32:22.315 --> 32:23.399
there's a couple weak lines
in here.

32:23.483 --> 32:26.235
<i>And pulling that longline</i>
<i>on that flag pole</i>

32:26.319 --> 32:26.778
<i>was a son of a [bleep],</i>

32:26.861 --> 32:28.696
<i>and it showed</i>

32:28.780 --> 32:29.947
<i>that you had a little bit</i>
<i>of difficulty with it.</i>

32:30.031 --> 32:33.284
You are the guy who is working
the hardest from the bottom

32:33.368 --> 32:34.661
and trying to dig your way up.

32:34.744 --> 32:35.662
You're definitely not
going home today, buddy.

32:35.745 --> 32:36.621
That's all I want.

32:36.704 --> 32:37.580
That's the best
I can give you,

32:37.664 --> 32:38.706
but you ain't the one leaving.

32:38.790 --> 32:38.998
Thank you.

32:41.250 --> 32:42.335
Nick.

32:43.127 --> 32:44.212
How'd you feel
going into this?

32:44.295 --> 32:46.172
{\an1}I've never had experience
doing American traditional.

32:46.255 --> 32:48.883
<i>Basically I was</i>
<i>a little worried, very nervous.</i>

32:48.966 --> 32:51.219
<i>And then they wanted that</i>
<i>snake and dagger redemption.</i>

32:51.302 --> 32:54.806
The design of this tattoo
is killing me.

32:54.889 --> 32:57.225
{\an1}<i>The bottom of the flag</i>
<i>has a square hook on it.</i>

32:57.308 --> 32:59.811
<i>The mouth that you did,</i>
<i>biting the snake,</i>

32:59.894 --> 33:02.313
<i>the way you did it just looks</i>
<i>like it has no bottom jaw.</i>

33:02.397 --> 33:03.564
And the snake head,
no reduction there.

33:03.648 --> 33:05.692
<i>Zero reduction.</i>

33:05.775 --> 33:06.818
<i>There's nothing traditional</i>
<i>about it.</i>

33:06.901 --> 33:09.529
Doing [bleep] like this
is disrespectful.

33:09.612 --> 33:10.947
Sorry for being
disrespectful.

33:11.030 --> 33:12.740
This is a tribute
to tradition.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.742
It's not "Create
your own [bleep]" day.

33:18.121 --> 33:19.247
Head back to the loft.

33:19.330 --> 33:21.791
Call you back when
we've made a decision.

33:24.168 --> 33:25.837
You're here
to be an <i> Ink Master</i> .

33:25.920 --> 33:27.088
You should be able
to do everything.

33:27.171 --> 33:29.048
Your tattoo had bad lines
and a [bleep] up stripe.

33:29.132 --> 33:31.718
I thought you were going home
'cause of that.

33:31.801 --> 33:33.052
Oh, then you thought somebody
other than yourself

33:33.136 --> 33:33.928
was going home.

33:34.011 --> 33:35.221
What did the judges say
to you?

33:35.304 --> 33:36.472
There was nothing traditional

33:36.556 --> 33:40.101
about that big-ass [bleep]
blue snoopy cloud.

33:40.184 --> 33:41.894
So you copied one
and still [bleep] it up.

33:41.978 --> 33:44.605
You damn right,
I [bleep] it up.

33:44.689 --> 33:45.773
That ain't what
the judges said, though.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.108
I'm the only one--

33:47.191 --> 33:48.609
I'm the only one they said,
"You ain't going home."

33:48.693 --> 33:49.777
I can tell you that.

33:49.861 --> 33:50.778
Dude, you were nervous.

33:50.862 --> 33:52.321
This is the last time
I say this [bleep].

33:52.405 --> 33:53.614
I play my games
like a mother[bleep].

33:53.698 --> 33:56.284
{\an5}-Oh.

33:53.698 --> 33:56.284
-My god.

33:56.367 --> 33:57.452
I'm a [bleep] predator.

33:57.535 --> 33:58.953
That's what I do.
You're weak...

33:59.036 --> 34:00.872
{\an5}-I think you just talk a lot.

33:59.036 --> 34:00.872
-You're weak, you're weak.

34:00.955 --> 34:02.290
You're definitely weak.
Look at you.

34:02.373 --> 34:03.249
You're strong.
I respect you.

34:03.332 --> 34:05.626
You're weak too.
I'll be playing with you.

34:05.710 --> 34:07.128
{\an1}Every single challenge--
The hardest [bleep] ones--

34:07.211 --> 34:10.630
I have never gotten nervous
while I was working.

34:10.715 --> 34:12.842
I'm a [bleep] predator.

34:12.925 --> 34:14.927
I kept my cool,
and I did kick-ass pieces.

34:15.011 --> 34:16.387
<i>You're obviously</i>
<i>on the bottom.</i>

34:16.471 --> 34:18.181
{\an8}You have been playing
a mental game

34:18.264 --> 34:19.556
{\an8}that hasn't been working.

34:19.639 --> 34:21.309
I'm dancing around your head
all the time.

34:21.391 --> 34:23.143
No you're not.
You mean nothing to me.

34:23.226 --> 34:24.145
I control your emotions.

34:24.228 --> 34:25.313
Nothing.
No you don't.

34:25.396 --> 34:27.106
I'm Geppetto.
You're Pinocchio.

34:27.190 --> 34:29.025
If he can't beat me
in tattooing,

34:29.108 --> 34:31.402
he's gonna try
and beat me mentally.

34:31.485 --> 34:33.612
I can tattoo circles
around Kay Kutta

34:33.696 --> 34:34.572
any day of the week.

34:34.655 --> 34:36.657
Y'all can't stop thinking
about me, man.

34:36.741 --> 34:38.534
I am a factor in this thing.

34:38.618 --> 34:41.245
I'm mentally stronger than
a lot of people in this house.

34:41.329 --> 34:42.288
That's not my fault.

34:42.371 --> 34:43.998
That's the way god made me.

34:44.081 --> 34:45.333
Don't hate me,
hate god.

34:52.255 --> 34:53.424
I know they did say that

34:53.507 --> 34:56.344
traditional tattoos
are becoming more popular.

34:56.427 --> 34:58.721
When that style comes back
into my shop, in waves,

34:58.805 --> 34:59.889
I'm just gonna hire my grandpa.

34:59.972 --> 35:02.850
Do you know calculus?
Do you know how to do calculus?

35:02.934 --> 35:05.853
No! Because a [bleep] calculator
knows how to do calculus!

35:05.937 --> 35:06.687
So why do I have to sit here
and dumb myself down

35:06.771 --> 35:09.816
to do this damn thing?

35:09.899 --> 35:11.776
American traditional.
Lines.

35:11.859 --> 35:13.069
You can tell
this rattled everybody.

35:13.152 --> 35:14.695
I think it scared
the [bleep] out of them.

35:14.779 --> 35:16.114
As far as a tattoo
of the day goes,

35:16.197 --> 35:17.698
nobody hit the mark 100 percent.

35:17.782 --> 35:19.659
Well, what do we think here?
Kay Kutta?

35:19.742 --> 35:20.409
[Oliver] <i> There's definitely</i>
<i>some examples</i>

35:20.493 --> 35:21.494
<i>of some good lines in here.</i>

35:21.577 --> 35:24.539
There's also some examples
of some poor lines.

35:24.622 --> 35:26.207
Considering the field,
it's pretty good.

35:26.290 --> 35:27.708
Who do you think's
in the bottom of the heap?

35:27.792 --> 35:29.961
[Oliver] <i> Well, Clint's is not</i>
<i>aesthetically pleasing</i>

35:30.044 --> 35:31.546
<i>from the American traditional</i>
<i>point of view.</i>

35:31.629 --> 35:33.798
This looks clean and solid
and good.

35:33.881 --> 35:34.715
Super clean.

35:34.799 --> 35:36.134
What makes it not American
traditional?

35:36.217 --> 35:37.468
Well, that eagle, for one.

{\an5}<i>-The calligraphied lines.</i>

That's an eagle
with a helmet on?

35:46.477 --> 35:48.396
It's a jumble,
stuff stacked on stuff.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.236
<i>The eagle</i>
<i>could have been drawn better.</i>

35:55.319 --> 35:56.320
The hard part's
not the tattooing,

35:56.404 --> 35:57.238
it's the drawing.

35:57.321 --> 35:58.322
[Dave] <i> Lalo.</i>

35:59.824 --> 36:01.117
[Oliver] <i> All he had to do</i>

35:59.824 --> 36:01.117
<i>was do a really good flag,</i>

36:01.200 --> 36:02.910
and it would have been
top-notch.

36:02.994 --> 36:04.036
Could have been the best one.

36:04.120 --> 36:06.080
{\an5}-[Dave] Jesse.

<i>None of us liked this tattoo.</i>

36:08.791 --> 36:10.084
<i>But he did clean line work</i>
<i>in it.</i>

36:10.167 --> 36:11.711
<i>He's out of his element here.</i>

36:11.794 --> 36:14.046
And I think
it really humbled him down.

36:39.989 --> 36:40.823
Judging on the outline alone,

36:40.907 --> 36:42.658
which one of these has
the worst outline?

36:42.742 --> 36:44.785
She had that big thigh,

36:44.869 --> 36:46.162

Ollie, it's
a coin flip, buddy.

in your head, man.

38:43.988 --> 38:44.905
Look at what you're drawing.

38:44.989 --> 38:46.991
I think it's safe to say

38:47.074 --> 38:49.744
that composition or design's
always going to be a factor.

38:49.827 --> 38:51.245
Tatu baby.

38:51.328 --> 38:53.497
{\an8}There are some really
clean lines in this tattoo.

38:53.581 --> 38:54.957
{\an8}<i>Which shows me</i>
<i>that you can do it.</i>

38:55.041 --> 38:57.376
{\an8}But it doesn't explain to me

38:57.460 --> 39:00.254
why you can't do it
on every line in the tattoo.

39:00.337 --> 39:02.339
Every line is
just as important.

39:02.423 --> 39:03.924
In this case, you might have
shot yourself in the foot

39:04.008 --> 39:05.092
<i>by doing that rope</i>

39:05.176 --> 39:07.178
<i>that gave you</i>
<i>an extra hundred lines to do.</i>

39:07.261 --> 39:08.429
There's just certain areas
of this tattoo

39:08.512 --> 39:10.723
{\an5}-that are killing you.

39:08.512 --> 39:10.723
-I worked with what I had.

39:10.806 --> 39:12.475
I still feel, I still did
pretty strong,

39:12.558 --> 39:14.685
and I still deserve
to be here.

39:17.605 --> 39:18.731
Ron.

39:18.814 --> 39:20.191
You've had a lot
of hard times with outlines.

39:20.274 --> 39:21.442
And in this tattoo, man,

39:21.525 --> 39:23.027
<i>we feel like this</i>
<i>is an impossible tattoo to fix.</i>

39:23.110 --> 39:25.446
<i>And I feel like this line work</i>

39:25.529 --> 39:26.322
was a little better
than the last one.

39:26.405 --> 39:27.823
There's a lot
of rough lines in there.

39:27.907 --> 39:30.159
<i>I mean, that flag speaks loud</i>
<i>and clear what's going on.</i>

39:30.242 --> 39:32.703
[Ron]
<i>My first traditional tattoo.</i>

39:32.787 --> 39:34.038
First time
I've ever drawn one.

39:34.121 --> 39:35.206
What I find kind of amazing
is you entered

39:35.289 --> 39:38.084
a competition show about
tattooing called <i> Ink Master,</i>

39:38.167 --> 39:40.211
and the popular excuse
for everything

39:40.294 --> 39:41.712
seems to be inexperience.

39:41.796 --> 39:42.838
I fought tooth and nail
to get where I am.

39:42.922 --> 39:45.216
And even harder for me,
being a black tattoo artist.

39:45.299 --> 39:47.301
Everything I've got,
I've fought for.

39:47.384 --> 39:48.886
If you guys let me get a pass,

39:48.969 --> 39:50.596
I promise you, you won't
be calling my name next week.

39:51.931 --> 39:53.557
Clint.

39:53.641 --> 39:56.352
Clint, you did a graphic take
on American traditional.

39:56.435 --> 39:57.728
{\an8}[Clint] <i> You're absolutely right.</i>

39:57.812 --> 39:59.188
{\an8}[Chris] <i> You just calligraphied</i>
<i>the hell out of it.</i>

39:59.271 --> 40:00.272
I'm not gonna come up here

40:00.356 --> 40:01.315
and I'm not gonna feed you
no bull[bleep].

40:01.398 --> 40:02.608
I just outthought myself
on this tattoo.

40:02.691 --> 40:04.276
I took it to an extreme
which I shouldn't have.

40:04.360 --> 40:06.487
But if we're gonna take this
in one subject,

40:06.570 --> 40:07.780
and that's line work,

40:07.863 --> 40:08.948
I know for a fact,

40:09.031 --> 40:09.865
you've told me
from your mouth,

40:09.949 --> 40:11.826
I have the cleanest lines
and ability.

40:11.909 --> 40:12.868
I'm not a good tattoo artist.

40:12.952 --> 40:14.161
I'm a damned good
tattoo artist.

40:14.245 --> 40:16.622
I've dedicated everything
in my entire life to this.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.002
The judges have decided.

40:30.052 --> 40:31.345
Ron.

40:31.428 --> 40:33.764
You do not have what it takes
to be <i> Ink Master</i> .

40:36.392 --> 40:38.435
It was a tough decision
for us overall.

40:38.519 --> 40:41.689
We feel like it's
the toughest tattoo to fix.

40:41.772 --> 40:44.525
Please pack your machines
and close up shop.

40:44.608 --> 40:45.776
I'm pretty bummed out.

40:45.860 --> 40:47.236
<i>There were some worse-looking</i>
<i>eagles than mine.</i>

40:47.319 --> 40:48.195
<i>There were some</i>
<i>[bleep] up flags.</i>

40:48.279 --> 40:49.697
There were some backward images.

40:49.780 --> 40:51.699
At the end of the day,
I did my best.

40:51.782 --> 40:53.367
<i>Do I think</i>
<i>I should be going home?</i>

40:53.451 --> 40:54.577
[bleep] no.

40:57.288 --> 40:59.456
[narrator] <i> On the next episode</i>
<i>of</i> Ink Master.<i> ..</i>

40:59.540 --> 41:01.000
Sarah, you don't do well
under pressure.

41:01.083 --> 41:01.834
I do!

41:01.917 --> 41:03.043
Nobody in this house
has my back.

41:03.127 --> 41:05.254
You're a [bleep] dick.

41:05.337 --> 41:07.923
I'm getting a phoenix shooting
fire out of my vagina.

41:08.674 --> 41:09.717
Out of her vagina?

41:09.800 --> 41:10.885
Are you [bleep] crazy?

41:10.968 --> 41:12.052
[laughs]

41:12.136 --> 41:14.138
{\an8}My canvas has,
like, five personalities.

41:14.221 --> 41:16.015
{\an8}You added that [bleep]
without telling me.

41:16.098 --> 41:17.641
She's just [bleep] crazy.

41:17.725 --> 41:18.893
{\an8}Are you kidding me?

41:18.976 --> 41:20.269
{\an8}It's on my back.
You can't [bleep] see it.

41:20.352 --> 41:23.230
{\an8}Yes, you're [bleep] up
the tattoo.

41:23.314 --> 41:24.481
-No, no.

41:23.314 --> 41:24.481
-Yes, yes!

41:24.565 --> 41:26.567
{\an8}I'm gonna straight choke you
from the [bleep] out.
