Max: Self-made millionaire
Archibaldo de la Colmena

00:22.897 --> 00:25.567
lived life in the fast lane,
but shunned the spotlight.

A globetrotting jet setter
who loved to gamble and win big,

00:30.822 --> 00:33.283
he was equally at home opening
restaurants in exotic islands

00:33.324 --> 00:35.493
as he was advising
political leaders,

was by his side.

Max: So what was it
about American documentarian

01:11.654 --> 01:15.492
Alba Fontana that made him
finally settle down?

01:15.533 --> 01:19.454
- I believe he saw
something selfless in Alba.

01:19.496 --> 01:21.623
Something he perhaps lost
along the way.

01:23.500 --> 01:27.671
And, if I may,
the air of doom in her eyes.

01:29.881 --> 01:31.883
[***]

01:33.385 --> 01:34.761
- She possesses
the beautiful look

01:34.803 --> 01:38.264
of a martyr suffering
in ecstasy.

[Chuckle]

01:39.474 --> 01:40.809
- Inocencia, how old were you

01:40.850 --> 01:42.852
when you started working
for Archibaldo?

01:42.894 --> 01:46.648
- A teenager.
I was 16, 17.

01:46.690 --> 01:49.192
- And you worked for him
during his marriage to Alba?

01:49.234 --> 01:51.569
- Yes.
Miss Alba taught me how to read.

01:51.611 --> 01:52.696
[Chuckle]

01:52.737 --> 01:54.781
She was not
the most patient teacher.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.199
She pushed me very hard

01:56.241 --> 01:58.159
and she sometimes
was disappointed

01:58.201 --> 01:59.703
in my choice of books.

01:59.744 --> 02:03.373
She would say, "If I have known
you would learn how to read

02:03.415 --> 02:05.625
just so you could read
tabloid magazines and the Bible,

02:05.667 --> 02:07.877
I would've never
taught you anything!"

02:07.919 --> 02:10.630
- Why do you think Alba
was so offended by the Bible?

02:10.672 --> 02:14.384
- It's because of
what happened to her, you know.

02:14.426 --> 02:17.262
When Archibaldo
fell in love with Alba,

02:17.303 --> 02:19.389
her tragedy in the Amazon
had just happened.

02:21.349 --> 02:23.184
- What do you think happened?

02:23.226 --> 02:24.811
- She would never speak of it.

02:24.853 --> 02:26.813
I only know the official story.

02:26.855 --> 02:28.273
The massacre of her crew

02:28.314 --> 02:30.316
and the fact
she escaped barely alive.

02:30.358 --> 02:31.693
It's a miracle.

02:34.237 --> 02:37.907
I think those images captured
the heart of Archibaldo.

02:37.949 --> 02:39.576
And when he learned
her backstory,

02:39.617 --> 02:41.536
about how when she was
making the documentary

02:41.578 --> 02:43.705
about the organic
coffee farmers in Oaxaca,

02:43.747 --> 02:49.210
that earthquake decimated
the entire village except her.

02:49.252 --> 02:52.005
Those two horrible tragedies
back to back

02:52.047 --> 02:54.841
and her survival spirit,

02:54.883 --> 03:01.306
I think that was irresistible
for a man like Archibaldo.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.600
I think he wanted to save her.

03:03.641 --> 03:08.938
Max: Did you ever think at
any point maybe Alba is cursed?

03:08.980 --> 03:11.399
- No.
- Never?

03:15.695 --> 03:17.280
- No.

03:17.322 --> 03:18.865
- Hmm.

03:18.907 --> 03:23.536
Even after what happened when
she and Archibaldo were married?

03:23.578 --> 03:26.706
- We all have
different crosses to bear.

03:26.748 --> 03:30.251
Telling the story of the Sisters
of the Holy Tears convent

03:30.293 --> 03:32.879
was very dear to Archibaldo

03:32.921 --> 03:38.593
and Alba, his proud new bride,
wanted to please him.

what happened next.

and it happened to be Fausto?

You know the chances of that
are like one in 700 million?

14:34.708 --> 14:37.419
- Well I...
I do little jobs for you,

14:37.460 --> 14:39.045
and I let you fuck me
once in a while

14:39.087 --> 14:41.089
because you have me
over a barrel,

14:41.131 --> 14:45.135
but if I could get away with
killing a judge, I would've.

14:45.176 --> 14:47.220
- Thank you for sharing that.

14:47.262 --> 14:48.555
- The first time
I sucked your cock,

14:48.596 --> 14:51.725
I got a headache
that lasted three days.

14:51.766 --> 14:54.060
- Now you're just trying
to make a point.

14:54.102 --> 14:57.188
Sierra: Maybe I'm exaggerating.
It was only two days.

15:02.360 --> 15:04.029
What's this?

15:04.070 --> 15:05.363
- I closed out your file.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.532
Erased your records
on the computer.

15:07.574 --> 15:08.950
Everything.

15:12.829 --> 15:15.206
- Let's pretend I believe you.

15:15.248 --> 15:18.168
- You can have a spotless record
for 20 years

15:18.209 --> 15:20.628
but once it's not spotless,
it's only a matter of time

15:20.670 --> 15:25.425
before some ambitious
do-gooder starts digging around

15:25.467 --> 15:30.388
and finds some irregularities
in the records.

15:30.430 --> 15:35.518
Wheels turn slowly,
but they do indeed turn.

15:35.560 --> 15:40.190
So now you're asking yourself
what's this got to do with me.

15:40.231 --> 15:42.734
I'm gonna tell you.

15:42.776 --> 15:45.070
See, I may or may not be
under investigation.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.655
That means anywhere from
six to eight weeks from now,

15:47.697 --> 15:50.784
the court is going to hand down
a revised order

15:50.825 --> 15:52.827
and revoke your bail.

15:54.788 --> 15:57.374
So now that I know
you're listening to me,

15:57.415 --> 16:00.585
let me tell you about the job.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.587
It's a traveling show
out of Houston.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.214
Diamonds.

16:04.255 --> 16:05.423
They're gonna be held
in a storage facility

16:05.465 --> 16:07.133
in Puerto Vallarta

16:07.175 --> 16:10.261
before they are put
on exhibited for some charity.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.721
- I don't have contacts
in Mexico.

16:11.763 --> 16:13.348
- I do.

16:13.390 --> 16:14.849
None of the principals
will know each other.

16:14.891 --> 16:17.519
- Better that way.
- Better for who?

16:17.560 --> 16:21.189
- "Better for whom".

16:21.231 --> 16:22.857
Let me lay it out for you,

16:22.899 --> 16:26.528
get to the part
where the choice comes in.

16:26.569 --> 16:28.154
You see, I want you
to have all the facts,

16:28.196 --> 16:30.824
at least
all the foreseeable ones.

16:30.865 --> 16:33.159
You want a drink?

16:33.201 --> 16:35.328
- I'd rather
stay sober for this.

16:35.370 --> 16:40.208
- Suit yourself.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.669
[Glass thuds]

16:42.711 --> 16:44.212
- How many in the string?

16:44.254 --> 16:46.506
- You plus two,
the way I figure it.

16:46.548 --> 16:49.592
Malone: That's a small crew
for a foreign job.

16:49.634 --> 16:51.094
What kind of security?

16:51.136 --> 16:55.348
- Motion sensors, safes, locks,
nothing you can't handle.

16:55.390 --> 16:58.768
Malone: And how do we
get out of the country?

16:58.810 --> 17:03.273
- That is where
my Mexican contacts come in.

17:03.314 --> 17:06.609
We will fly you out
with the diamonds.

17:06.651 --> 17:09.487
You, the pilot,
and the diamonds.

17:13.324 --> 17:15.452
- And what about the other two?

17:15.493 --> 17:18.788
- That is where
the choice comes in.

17:18.830 --> 17:21.207
- What if I don't
wanna play ball?

17:21.249 --> 17:24.252
- I'd get over it,
but I'd feel a little stupid.

17:24.294 --> 17:26.463
- Killing is never
the best idea.

17:26.504 --> 17:29.466
- Human nature
is a fascinating thing.

17:29.507 --> 17:32.302
My mother taught me
to be an advocate,

17:32.344 --> 17:34.512
stand up for what's right,

17:34.554 --> 17:37.682
never compromise my values.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.935
I often wonder what she would've
made of this upside-down world.

17:40.977 --> 17:43.355
- How do you know
I don't know these people?

17:43.396 --> 17:45.774
- You don't.

17:45.815 --> 17:48.651
- You don't know everybody
I've ever worked with.

17:48.693 --> 17:50.904
- You ever worked
with someone named Malone?

17:50.945 --> 17:52.322
- No.

17:52.364 --> 17:55.658
- How about Loba?
You remember that name?

17:55.700 --> 17:57.243
- Doesn't ring a bell.

17:57.285 --> 17:59.788
- Well, that's because they work
in different places than you do.

17:59.829 --> 18:01.748
You know, I didn't suddenly
wake up this morning

18:01.790 --> 18:03.416
and put this together.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.418
I've been working on it
for a while.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.420
And I need a wheelman.

18:07.462 --> 18:08.963
- Why not get a bigger plane?

18:09.005 --> 18:12.676
- Ah, there's still
hope for you.

18:12.717 --> 18:15.220
All things being equal,
of course,

18:15.261 --> 18:18.807
there's probably a way
we can get a bigger plane.

18:18.848 --> 18:21.351
But see, then the split

18:21.393 --> 18:22.727
doesn't make sense
for my partners

18:22.769 --> 18:27.857
or, if I'm honest, for me.

18:27.899 --> 18:30.902
- Why me?
- You have limited options.

18:30.944 --> 18:32.696
I have a job for you.

18:32.737 --> 18:34.698
You're gonna work
with a team of professionals

18:34.739 --> 18:37.283
that I will assemble,
go into Mexico,

18:37.325 --> 18:40.787
steal some diamonds,
be flown out.

18:40.829 --> 18:44.290
You will get a hundred grand.

18:44.332 --> 18:46.459
So what's so fucking hard
about that?

18:46.501 --> 18:48.294
- All I do is drive.

18:48.336 --> 18:49.546
- Well, that's
your job description,

18:49.587 --> 18:51.715
so that's what you do.

18:51.756 --> 18:53.049
Anything that happens
to the others

18:53.091 --> 18:55.510
is outside my need to know.

18:55.552 --> 18:56.970
- That's the right attitude.

18:57.012 --> 18:58.722
- Tell me about Braun and Loba.

18:58.763 --> 19:00.056
- What do you want to hear?

19:00.098 --> 19:01.558
That they're
a couple intellectuals

19:01.599 --> 19:02.767
who go out of their way

19:02.809 --> 19:04.394
to make the world
a better place?

19:04.436 --> 19:06.646
- Does that make a difference?
- It might.

19:06.688 --> 19:08.356
Lasalle: Why?

19:08.398 --> 19:10.734
- You really wanna go down
this road, Your Honor?

19:10.775 --> 19:12.777
- I'm telling you how it is

19:12.819 --> 19:16.865
because I'm in a bind
and I can't protect you anymore.

19:16.906 --> 19:19.075
This is me
looking out for myself.

19:19.117 --> 19:20.702
Cashing in.

19:20.744 --> 19:22.912
Now if that gets you a passport
and a hundred grand,

19:22.954 --> 19:25.582
that's one hell
of a running start, isn't it?

19:30.670 --> 19:32.464
I got you a present.

19:41.139 --> 19:43.767
For good luck.

19:43.808 --> 19:45.602
- What if it doesn't work?

19:45.643 --> 19:47.103
- Why wouldn't it?

19:47.145 --> 19:50.774
- Like someone wise said,
the map is not the territory.

19:50.815 --> 19:52.984
You must have a set
of contingencies planned out.

19:55.987 --> 19:57.947
- I do.

19:57.989 --> 20:00.033
- I do this job and we're even.

20:00.075 --> 20:02.369
I get my cut
and we don't see each other.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.412
- That's your pitch?
- Yes.

20:04.454 --> 20:06.122
- You have a cash-flow problem.

20:06.164 --> 20:07.624
- Yes.

20:07.665 --> 20:09.959
- And you are
under investigation.

20:10.001 --> 20:11.961
- Yes.

20:12.003 --> 20:15.131
- And you don't
wanna go for seconds?

20:15.173 --> 20:17.467
What, you have another meeting
or something?

20:17.509 --> 20:20.011
- I think you still haven't lost
your sense of rhythm.

20:22.764 --> 20:24.474
I got you a present.

20:26.184 --> 20:28.895
- What is it?
A tracker bracelet?

20:36.069 --> 20:38.738
- Why don't you wear them
for good luck?

20:38.780 --> 20:40.448
- Now or during the job?

20:40.490 --> 20:43.451
- That is up to you,
but if you wear them now,

20:43.493 --> 20:47.497
they probably
won't stay on very long.

20:47.539 --> 20:49.082
- I don't like it.

20:49.124 --> 20:50.834
Lasalle:
If somebody kills your mother,

20:50.875 --> 20:52.544
would you want to kill them?

20:52.585 --> 20:55.380
I wasn't too keen on her
but out of principle, sure.

20:55.422 --> 20:56.756
- Does it matter
if when you find them

20:56.798 --> 20:58.591
they're sitting at the table
eating cereal,

20:58.633 --> 20:59.801
or would you only kill them

20:59.843 --> 21:01.678
if they had a gun
pointed at you?

21:01.720 --> 21:03.513
- It would help.

21:03.555 --> 21:04.889
Lasalle:
When it comes down to it,

21:04.931 --> 21:06.683
if it's you or them,
what does it matter?

21:06.725 --> 21:08.601
- Oh, so now it's me or them.

21:08.643 --> 21:10.437
Lasalle:
The reason it's not you

21:10.478 --> 21:13.440
is because I made my partners
understand that I need you.

21:13.481 --> 21:14.941
- And why is that?

21:14.983 --> 21:18.403
- Because I like you.

21:18.445 --> 21:19.612
[Scoffs]

21:19.654 --> 21:21.614
- Try again.

21:21.656 --> 21:23.575
- Because I have feelings
for you.

21:25.076 --> 21:27.454
Complicated feelings, yes.

21:29.956 --> 21:32.792
- Try one more time.

21:32.834 --> 21:35.045
[Sighs]

21:35.086 --> 21:37.881
- Because if they could
cut me out, they would.

21:37.922 --> 21:42.052
So I need someone I trust
to bring me the diamonds.

21:42.093 --> 21:44.971
- But like I said,
this is all just a theory.

21:45.013 --> 21:51.144
None of this really happened.
This is just a coincidence.

21:51.186 --> 21:52.562
[Rattling]

21:52.604 --> 21:53.730
- Do not even.

21:53.772 --> 21:54.898
- We seem to have
a trust problem.

21:54.939 --> 21:56.733
- We certainly do.
- Any ideas?

21:56.775 --> 21:58.777
Sierra: Not right off.
- I have an idea.

22:04.908 --> 22:07.077
Malone: Well, take your
fuckin' time, Clover.

22:07.118 --> 22:09.537
Clover: This is only a theory,
like yours.

22:09.579 --> 22:11.664
But if all three of us
agreed to the job

22:11.706 --> 22:13.041
knowing that the other two
wouldn't make it,

22:13.083 --> 22:14.668
then we're all the same, right?

22:14.709 --> 22:16.211
Nobody's better
than anybody else here.

22:16.252 --> 22:19.255
Sierra: So?
Clover: So maybe...

22:19.297 --> 22:20.840
I read this book once...

22:20.882 --> 22:22.592
Well, I didn't read it,
somebody else read it,

22:22.634 --> 22:24.678
but it basically explains
how after you do something

22:24.719 --> 22:27.013
for 10,000 hours
you get the hang of it.

22:27.055 --> 22:28.848
Did you guys
ever read that book?

22:28.890 --> 22:30.100
- This is not a book club,
Clover,

22:30.141 --> 22:31.726
get to the fucking point!
- Let her finish.

22:31.768 --> 22:34.104
- What if I didn't panic
at that checkpoint?

22:34.145 --> 22:35.939
What if some part of me
knew something was wrong

22:35.980 --> 22:38.733
because I've been a getaway
driver for over 10,000 hours?

22:44.072 --> 22:45.865
- Because there shouldn't
have been a police checkpoint

22:45.907 --> 22:48.159
off an access road that wasn't
any sort of main artery

22:48.201 --> 22:49.869
where you could smuggle drugs.

22:49.911 --> 22:51.079
- What are you talking about?

22:51.121 --> 22:52.706
- I hate having ideas like this

22:52.747 --> 22:54.207
because I know
who they make work for,

22:54.249 --> 22:58.044
which is me, but I think
we should bring our guns down.

22:58.086 --> 23:00.588
- Not a fuckin' hope in hell.
Malone: What's your idea?

23:00.630 --> 23:02.799
- Well, I'm thinking
that the cops at the checkpoint

23:02.841 --> 23:06.052
were not in it with Clover
and they were not in it with me,

23:06.094 --> 23:08.221
so that means
they were in it with you.

23:08.263 --> 23:10.765
- That doesn't even make sense.
Malone: No, it does.

23:10.807 --> 23:12.225
It does makes sense.

23:12.267 --> 23:13.768
Ray could've meant
what he said and picked me

23:13.810 --> 23:15.645
as the one to make it out alive,

23:15.687 --> 23:17.731
had his Mexican contacts
pose as cops.

23:17.772 --> 23:19.065
- Or maybe they really are cops.

23:19.107 --> 23:20.483
- True, maybe they really
are cops.

23:20.525 --> 23:22.777
And we could've killed you two
right then and there.

23:22.819 --> 23:24.237
- But why there?
Sierra: Why not there?

23:24.279 --> 23:26.614
- There was another dirt road
past the checkpoint.

23:26.656 --> 23:28.783
I studied it on the map.

23:28.825 --> 23:30.243
Maybe that was a shortcut
to the airfield.

23:30.285 --> 23:31.953
- If there was an airfield.

23:35.123 --> 23:37.083
- Fuck, right,

23:37.125 --> 23:38.710
maybe there never was
an airfield

23:38.752 --> 23:40.754
if the Mexican cops
were gonna kill two of us.

23:40.795 --> 23:43.131
- Or all of us.

23:43.173 --> 23:44.716
[Doorbell rings]

23:46.718 --> 23:50.889
- Who is it?
Inocencia: It's me, Inocencia.

23:50.930 --> 23:54.184
I'm looking for Miss Alba.

23:54.225 --> 23:55.935
Can I come in?

23:58.813 --> 24:00.315
- Just a minute!

24:09.491 --> 24:11.159
- Who is she?
- The housekeeper.

24:11.201 --> 24:12.911
- Ex-housekeeper.
- And why is she here?

24:12.952 --> 24:14.746
- I, I, I don't know.

24:16.831 --> 24:20.168
- Get rid of her or I kill her.

24:20.210 --> 24:21.753
[Chuckles]

24:23.713 --> 24:25.423
- Inocencia.
- Miss Alba.

24:25.465 --> 24:26.800
- What are you doing here?

24:26.841 --> 24:28.301
- You are a sight for sore eyes.

24:28.343 --> 24:30.929
I brought oranges from my tree,
your favorites.

24:30.970 --> 24:32.931
- Oh.
How did you even get here?

24:32.972 --> 24:34.265
- Oh, I took the bus.

24:34.307 --> 24:36.685
I left my village
like three hours ago.

24:36.726 --> 24:37.977
Can I come in?

24:38.019 --> 24:40.897
- It isn't a good time for me,
I'm sorry.

24:40.939 --> 24:42.982
- This is not a good time
for anyone, Miss Alba.

24:43.024 --> 24:44.317
Just this morning,

24:44.359 --> 24:46.319
a terrorist group launched
a new series of attacks.

24:46.361 --> 24:49.781
Some crazy kamikazes
blew themselves up in the market

24:49.823 --> 24:51.157
on their way to the synagogue.

24:51.199 --> 24:53.159
There were windows broken,
smoke everywhere.

24:53.201 --> 24:55.036
[Sighs]
I'm hungry

24:55.078 --> 24:57.997
and I would love to swim nude
in the ocean like a mermaid,

24:58.039 --> 25:00.083
but first, I have to tell you
something important.

25:00.125 --> 25:01.543
I must get it off my chest

25:01.584 --> 25:03.962
because I can no longer live
with it on my conscience.

25:04.004 --> 25:06.881
So with the Lord as my witness,

25:06.923 --> 25:08.925
I'm coming in,
whether you like it or not.

25:13.054 --> 25:15.473
[***]

25:21.396 --> 25:25.191
Woman, you should've told me
you have people over.

25:25.233 --> 25:26.735
Let me clean up this mess

25:26.776 --> 25:28.236
and I will tell you
the whole thing,

25:28.278 --> 25:30.280
from soup to nuts.

25:32.198 --> 25:33.366
- You little bitch!
