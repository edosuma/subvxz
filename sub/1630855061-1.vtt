00:05.046 --> 00:08.383
<i>Planet crust,
59.6% silica.</i>

00:08.383 --> 00:10.093
Again with the silica.

00:10.093 --> 00:11.720
It's always silica.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.138
<i>Scan complete.</i>

00:13.138 --> 00:16.683
<i>Minimal resources detected.
Planet has low potential.</i>

00:16.683 --> 00:18.893
Looks like my decision's made for me.

00:18.893 --> 00:21.062
Navigation, set course for home.

00:24.482 --> 00:25.483
What the...

00:38.329 --> 00:39.414
Aah!

01:18.244 --> 01:21.331
<i>Fuel core not found.
Switching to reserve power.</i>

01:21.331 --> 01:24.000
<i>Reserve power sufficient
for orbital launch.</i>

01:24.000 --> 01:25.085
That's good news.

01:25.085 --> 01:28.004
<i>Reserve power
depleted by orbital launch calculations.</i>

01:29.380 --> 01:31.466
That's bad design.

01:33.384 --> 01:35.053
I gotta find that fuel core.

01:44.437 --> 01:46.106
Can't let the inhabitants see me.

01:47.732 --> 01:48.733
Shit.

01:48.733 --> 01:50.652
Salutations, fellow traveler.

01:51.194 --> 01:54.197
Well, you don't look like
you're from around here.

01:55.156 --> 01:56.574
You must be a hobo!

01:56.574 --> 02:00.411
A poor hobo,
wandering the desert like an Israelite.

02:00.703 --> 02:04.374
I'm Freddy Underwood, Bible salesman
and good Samaritan,

02:04.374 --> 02:06.543
and you're coming with me.

02:06.543 --> 02:08.545
- I don't want to.
- I insist!

02:10.088 --> 02:11.965
So, you're taking me prisoner?

02:11.965 --> 02:14.509
I'm taking you for a hot meal.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.511
So, you're gonna eat me, then?

02:16.511 --> 02:18.763
I don't eat hobos.

02:18.763 --> 02:20.723
Not since the Great Depression.

02:24.894 --> 02:28.398
<i>...as reports come in of a
large crash somewhere in the desert</i>

02:28.398 --> 02:32.861
<i>of what some are saying
was an unidentified flying object.</i>

02:36.656 --> 02:39.701
I'm not much for news,
unless it's the Good News.

02:39.701 --> 02:42.662
Used to be a preacher.
Preached the Good Book.

02:42.662 --> 02:44.706
Then, something happened.

02:44.706 --> 02:46.457
Now I sell the Good Book!

02:46.457 --> 02:48.293
Don't believe in it anymore,

02:48.293 --> 02:50.128
because of what happened.

02:52.172 --> 02:53.756
And here we are!

02:54.174 --> 02:56.759
Grandma Macadoo's boarding house.

02:56.759 --> 02:57.969
You're gonna like her.

02:57.969 --> 03:00.263
She's a warm, earthy woman.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.307
But saltier than Lot's wife.

03:02.682 --> 03:06.311
I got a hungry one for you,
young Miss Macadoo.

03:06.311 --> 03:08.688
Little guy with long arms, huh?

03:08.688 --> 03:10.356
I dropped a dirty sex book

03:10.356 --> 03:12.442
on the far side of my clawfoot tub.

03:12.442 --> 03:15.987
If you can reach it, I'll give you
a big plate of chipped beef.

03:17.447 --> 03:18.698
Ah, he's running away.

03:19.282 --> 03:22.702
Grandma, this jackrabbit's head's
all mushy.

03:22.827 --> 03:24.537
Ew, gross.

03:26.915 --> 03:29.083
Can I make
his head all mushy?

03:54.943 --> 03:56.027
Oh, good! I'm up!

04:04.118 --> 04:06.371
Rip Van Winkle rises!

04:07.205 --> 04:08.456
I need to go.

04:08.456 --> 04:09.749
Suit yourself.

04:12.043 --> 04:14.921
Ha-ha! Someone smells that chipped beef.

04:14.921 --> 04:16.339
Chipped beef again?

04:16.339 --> 04:19.175
What did you think you
were getting, Luis? A salad?

04:19.717 --> 04:22.762
None for me, please. Watching my figure.

04:22.762 --> 04:24.973
Screen stars have to stay trim.

04:24.973 --> 04:27.850
I'm Roslyn Jenkins,
not that you know the name yet.

04:28.017 --> 04:30.645
I'm in New Mexico
for a brief respite,

04:30.645 --> 04:34.774
then I'm off to be a young ingenue
for Metro Goldwyn and Mayer.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.859
You've been here nine years.

04:36.859 --> 04:38.319
You're 60, right?

04:38.319 --> 04:39.737
I'm not 60!

04:40.154 --> 04:42.323
It's this damn dry air.

04:42.323 --> 04:44.575
Uncle Cosworth, you're joining us?

04:44.993 --> 04:47.829
Soon as I get this old girl loaded.

04:47.829 --> 04:51.207
Uncle Cosworth is one of the
last living Civil War veterans.

04:51.207 --> 04:53.710
He liked shooting so much,
he fought for both sides.

04:53.710 --> 04:56.713
Clifton! Put your little club down
and eat something.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.759
You know, I heard on the radio

05:01.759 --> 05:05.722
that some people think they saw
a Martian spaceship last night.

05:05.847 --> 05:08.266
You listen to my radio,
you pay me a nickel!

05:08.266 --> 05:09.684
I'll tell you something.

05:09.684 --> 05:10.935
As a crop duster...

05:10.935 --> 05:12.020
I'm a crop duster.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.771
I spend a lot of time in the air,

05:13.771 --> 05:17.358
and I've seen my fair share of things
in the sky that I cannot explain.

05:17.358 --> 05:19.444
Once, I saw what appeared
to be a blackbird,

05:19.444 --> 05:21.612
but it had the body of a mouse.

05:21.612 --> 05:23.448
And it was nighttime!

05:23.448 --> 05:25.825
Sounds like a bat to me, friend.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.076
A what?

05:29.037 --> 05:33.333
I also fought in the
Spanish-American War in 1898.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.376
Tremendous war.

05:35.376 --> 05:37.712
I don't know what it was about,

05:37.712 --> 05:40.631
but I'm sure we were the good guys.

05:41.090 --> 05:45.011
Luis, you don't know when that airplane
is gonna drop like a stone!

05:45.011 --> 05:48.264
You need to be at peace with
the big, bearded man in the clouds.

05:48.264 --> 05:50.183
You need a Bible.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.226
But you don't believe in the Bible.

05:52.226 --> 05:54.312
Some big, bearded man in the clouds?

05:54.312 --> 05:56.189
I'm not an idiot!

05:56.189 --> 05:58.316
But you can't afford to take chances.

05:58.316 --> 06:01.110
And I'd believe the Bible
if I could, trust that.

06:01.110 --> 06:02.236
But I can't.

06:02.236 --> 06:04.155
I'm locked out of the Gates.

06:04.155 --> 06:06.074
Because of all of those hobos I ate.

06:09.077 --> 06:12.872
And if you make new chipped beef
inside the old chipped beef,

06:12.872 --> 06:15.166
you never have to wash the pot!

06:15.333 --> 06:19.462
But do I make my debut
in comedy or tragedy?

06:19.462 --> 06:21.589
I mean, I can do both equal...

06:21.589 --> 06:24.008
Clifton! It's dead already!

06:24.717 --> 06:25.843
All done.

06:26.928 --> 06:29.597
I suppose that means
you'll be hitting the road?

06:40.733 --> 06:43.069
Evening, madam. I'm with the OSS.

06:43.069 --> 06:45.613
Wait, sorry. The CIA.

06:45.613 --> 06:47.824
They just changed the name on us.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.617
I'm Agent Avery Bullock.

06:49.617 --> 06:52.870
Wait! Sorry. Avery Bullock, Sr.

06:52.870 --> 06:55.748
I just had a son,
and he changed my name on me!

06:55.748 --> 06:57.542
Hello, citizens.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.794
I'm sure you've all heard about a crash

06:59.794 --> 07:01.170
that happened last night,

07:01.170 --> 07:04.090
and maybe you've even heard
it was a UFO.

07:04.298 --> 07:07.677
A UFO, can you imagine?

07:07.677 --> 07:09.887
Do you want to know what it really was?

07:09.887 --> 07:11.472
A weather balloon.

07:11.472 --> 07:14.642
A common, everyday,
you've-seen-it-a-thousand-times

07:14.642 --> 07:15.810
weather balloon.

07:15.810 --> 07:18.062
What is a weather balloon?

07:18.062 --> 07:19.772
It's a type of balloon.

07:19.772 --> 07:24.235
If it was just a balloon,
why is the OSS here?

07:24.235 --> 07:26.362
Why is the CIA here?

07:26.362 --> 07:29.031
What's that thing you're carrying?

07:29.031 --> 07:31.451
It's a tool for capturing
weather balloons.

07:31.451 --> 07:33.703
Now that I've answered
all your questions,

07:33.703 --> 07:34.912
flawlessly,

07:35.371 --> 07:36.581
I have a question.

07:36.581 --> 07:39.917
Have you seen any
suspicious characters around?

07:39.917 --> 07:41.461
Suspicious how?

07:41.461 --> 07:43.171
Just suspicious.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.589
Not an alien or anything,

07:44.589 --> 07:46.716
but maybe gray or green skin,

07:46.716 --> 07:48.384
maybe tentacles.

07:48.593 --> 07:52.346
Assistance in finding someone like that
would be greatly appreciated.

07:52.346 --> 07:57.268
And any resistance would be
greatly unappreciated.

07:57.268 --> 08:00.855
Mister, I know for a fact
that every one of us

08:00.855 --> 08:02.773
has seen a suspicious character.

08:05.026 --> 08:07.278
In the mirror!

08:09.113 --> 08:11.949
Well, I leave you
to your joyless laughter.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.328
Is it only six of you for dinner?

08:15.328 --> 08:16.996
You better believe it.

08:16.996 --> 08:20.166
Then why are there seven plates?

08:25.213 --> 08:27.215
Do I hear
the frightened whimpering

08:27.215 --> 08:29.675
of a nasty little
weather balloon in there?

08:45.107 --> 08:46.317
Well, this didn't work...

08:46.317 --> 08:48.277
I beg your pardon, madam.

08:48.277 --> 08:49.862
Wait, you think I'm a woman?

08:49.862 --> 08:51.280
But I look ridiculous.

08:51.280 --> 08:53.741
I've seen more fetching women, sure,

08:53.741 --> 08:57.203
but you're no more homely
than your very homely twin sister

08:57.203 --> 08:58.829
I saw out in the dining room.

08:58.829 --> 09:02.291
Because I look
just like Grandma Macadoo.

09:02.291 --> 09:03.417
Get out of my way!

09:03.417 --> 09:04.877
Chipped beef! Chipped beef!

09:06.045 --> 09:07.880
What in the twinly name
of Jacob and Esau?

09:07.880 --> 09:10.132
I'm back from the bathroom, everybody.

09:10.132 --> 09:13.094
Me. Grandma Macadoo's sister.

09:13.094 --> 09:15.846
Grandma Macadoo?

09:15.846 --> 09:18.891
Why did you all say there were
only six of you here?

09:18.891 --> 09:19.976
Oh, no!

09:19.976 --> 09:23.813
They couldn't hear you over the sound
of your stomach smelling chipped beef.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.022
I'll get you a bowl.

09:25.022 --> 09:27.525
The secret to chipped beef
is the creaminess,

09:27.525 --> 09:30.695
and the secret to my creaminess
is horse milk.

09:30.695 --> 09:33.948
Sure, horse milk tastes like grass
and smells like a horse,

09:33.948 --> 09:36.867
and cow milk is way better
in every way imaginable,

09:36.867 --> 09:39.537
but I don't have a cow
and I do have a horse.

09:41.706 --> 09:44.041
Or I did, before I chipped it up
and beefed it.

09:45.876 --> 09:48.379
It's like I'm looking in the mirror.

09:48.379 --> 09:50.506
Hobo? That's you, right?

09:51.007 --> 09:52.049
Somehow?

09:53.384 --> 09:57.346
One of the greatest acting performances
I've ever seen!

09:57.346 --> 10:00.391
You simply became Grandma Macadoo.

10:00.391 --> 10:03.436
What makes my disguise
so effective on humans?

10:04.979 --> 10:07.815
Well, it's time I came clean
about what I am.

10:07.815 --> 10:09.191
- A big ol' alien...
- Whoa, whoa.

10:09.191 --> 10:11.027
- Stop talking!
- No, no! Not our business!

10:11.027 --> 10:13.821
Let me explain something
to you, magical hobo.

10:13.821 --> 10:16.699
We all came to the middle
of nowhere for a reason.

10:16.699 --> 10:18.826
We don't talk about the past

10:18.826 --> 10:21.287
or who poisoned what daddy where,

10:21.287 --> 10:23.956
or why the well water went smelly.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.125
And don't ask me about
stealing my airplane,

10:26.125 --> 10:27.918
which doomed my squadron.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.754
I'm always joking about what I did,

10:29.754 --> 10:31.672
but it really actually truly happened!

10:31.672 --> 10:33.341
I did it. I ate 'em.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.217
Can you, uh, do me?

10:35.217 --> 10:36.385
Like you did Granny?

10:36.385 --> 10:39.388
I used to preach the Good Book,
now I sell it!

10:40.890 --> 10:42.099
Ah, do me!

10:42.558 --> 10:43.976
I'm a fresh young thing

10:43.976 --> 10:46.437
and my gorgeous little face
looks like a river map.

10:46.437 --> 10:49.315
I wanna become a star
by sitting here in the corner!

10:49.774 --> 10:51.025
Hey!

10:51.400 --> 10:53.235
It was brother against brother,

10:53.235 --> 10:55.738
which was tough because
I didn't have a brother.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.490
So, I had to shoot my sister.

11:01.202 --> 11:03.996
I like to fart a big load of dust
onto some crops,

11:03.996 --> 11:06.332
then go to town and pay a man and a lady

11:06.332 --> 11:08.501
to watch me have sex with my plane.

11:08.501 --> 11:11.587
Boy, this magical hobo was
listening to everything I said.

11:11.587 --> 11:13.255
Can you become anyone else?

11:13.255 --> 11:14.757
I don't know anyone else.

11:14.757 --> 11:17.593
What if we went into town,
met some other people?

11:17.593 --> 11:19.220
It's the Green Chile Festival.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.263
I should get going, actually.

11:21.263 --> 11:23.182
I have to find my spaceship's fuel core.

11:23.182 --> 11:25.142
- La-la-la-la-la.
- Try this.

11:25.142 --> 11:26.227
Trust me.

11:29.897 --> 11:32.149
Town. Chiles. Now.

12:10.688 --> 12:11.689
What's that?

12:12.106 --> 12:13.733
"Tent revival"?

12:14.191 --> 12:16.402
Is there something in there
I can put inside me,

12:16.402 --> 12:19.071
or put myself inside, or maybe,

12:19.071 --> 12:20.948
I don't know, rub on myself?

12:20.948 --> 12:23.367
I was there in the field,

12:23.367 --> 12:25.411
a man of clay,

12:25.411 --> 12:27.413
my heart and mind still mired

12:27.413 --> 12:31.125
in the frantic decadence
and sin of this modern life.

12:31.125 --> 12:35.045
"Green chile this" and "peep show" that.

12:35.045 --> 12:38.257
When out of the sky,

12:38.257 --> 12:40.217
it fell.

12:41.802 --> 12:44.555
It exploded into the ground

12:44.555 --> 12:46.766
and I went to it.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.518
My mind was made clear.

12:49.518 --> 12:52.563
My heart became full with the Lord.

12:52.563 --> 12:56.358
My hair became very easy to comb.

12:56.358 --> 12:59.028
My teeth fell out
and landed on the ground

12:59.028 --> 13:01.280
with a pretty little pitter-pat.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.741
And a voice whispered and I knew,

13:03.741 --> 13:05.367
I understood,

13:05.367 --> 13:07.995
that it was a sacred piece

13:07.995 --> 13:10.539
of Heaven's Wall!

13:10.539 --> 13:12.208
I must touch it!

13:15.002 --> 13:18.005
Only I may touch the relic.

13:20.090 --> 13:23.469
Now, we have all heard tell
of an alien in our midst.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.262
But I say to you this,

13:25.262 --> 13:28.474
it is not an alien that has come to us,

13:28.474 --> 13:31.185
but an angel!

13:40.486 --> 13:41.779
Oh...

13:41.987 --> 13:45.324
Lord, thank you for this sacred chunk.

13:45.324 --> 13:49.829
Let no man sunder me
from my godly chunk.

13:49.829 --> 13:50.913
Ta-da!

13:50.913 --> 13:55.084
Whoa, whoa, whoa! It's me! It's me!
The angel! I'm here for that.

13:56.168 --> 13:58.963
You don't look like an angel.

13:58.963 --> 14:01.382
Where are your wings?

14:01.382 --> 14:04.176
I tuck 'em into my robes
when I'm not flying.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.302
Where's your halo?

14:05.302 --> 14:06.387
Also tucked.

14:06.387 --> 14:08.389
Most of these things are for flying only

14:08.389 --> 14:10.516
and it's immediate tuck-time on landing.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.810
Looks like she's wearing
a piece of the tent.

14:13.352 --> 14:15.020
Can we see you fly?

14:15.020 --> 14:16.105
I'd rather not.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.732
Maybe I'll just shoot you, to be safe.

14:18.732 --> 14:20.734
I saw him fly.

14:21.819 --> 14:25.072
It was the most beautiful thing
I ever saw!

14:25.072 --> 14:27.533
It brought tears to these Southern eyes.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.952
And as I looked upon that flying angel,

14:29.952 --> 14:32.955
I said to myself, "Be strong, Roslyn!

14:32.955 --> 14:36.625
"Because whether it was
poison or not, Daddy is gone.

14:36.625 --> 14:39.128
"And if you just sit on your tuffet,

14:39.128 --> 14:42.214
"you'll never get to brush your hair
at the pink vanity of..."

14:42.214 --> 14:43.549
All right, that's plenty.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.551
I'm the angel, is the main takeaway,

14:45.551 --> 14:48.220
and I'm here for that piece
of our beautiful wall.

14:48.220 --> 14:50.389
There's a big hole near the Gate

14:50.389 --> 14:52.558
and sinners are wiggling through.

14:52.558 --> 14:54.476
Saint Peter's Gate?

14:55.519 --> 14:57.688
- Yup.
- It is an angel!

14:57.688 --> 14:59.648
I saw him fly, too!

14:59.648 --> 15:01.734
I think I saw him eat a big cheeseburger

15:01.734 --> 15:02.902
across the street!

15:04.069 --> 15:05.154
Hallelujah!

15:07.031 --> 15:08.657
Well, I guess I should be going,

15:08.657 --> 15:11.035
but God thanks you for your assistance.

15:11.035 --> 15:13.454
Will we get into Heaven for this?

15:13.454 --> 15:15.706
Boy, you guys sure are
excited about Heaven.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.333
What's it like?

15:17.458 --> 15:20.044
It's nice.

15:20.294 --> 15:21.712
It's very nice.

15:23.797 --> 15:25.925
Yeah, there's like the wall

15:25.925 --> 15:29.094
and the Gate, obviously.
I already mentioned those.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.013
What's inside the wall?

15:31.013 --> 15:35.184
Oh, it's got everything. There's a tent,
just like this and, um...

15:35.184 --> 15:37.019
Oh, they've got green chiles.

15:37.019 --> 15:40.147
As above, so below!

15:40.147 --> 15:42.775
Who wants a kiss
from a real angel?

15:42.775 --> 15:43.859
Form a line.

15:45.527 --> 15:46.570
Kiss line canceled.

15:46.570 --> 15:49.573
Everyone, link arms and form
a Heaven's Wall here on Earth

15:49.573 --> 15:50.658
with your bodies.

15:51.867 --> 15:53.035
You should see a doctor.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.204
Tell him God said,
"Radiation poisoning."

15:56.622 --> 15:57.623
Aaah!

15:57.623 --> 16:00.292
Looks like someone was hoping
to get back to Heaven,

16:00.292 --> 16:02.878
but I'm afraid I'm going
to have to take you

16:02.878 --> 16:06.548
someplace south of that.

16:12.721 --> 16:15.057
You're a clever one, gray man.

16:15.057 --> 16:17.226
But I'm a clever gray man, too.

16:17.226 --> 16:19.770
I realized you were no angel.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.939
Because I didn't have the wings.

16:22.189 --> 16:25.693
Ha! I didn't know for sure until
you just confirmed it.

16:25.693 --> 16:30.114
And now, I'm taking you to a
new secret facility in Nevada.

16:30.114 --> 16:33.158
It's called Area 51. State of the art.

16:33.158 --> 16:35.744
Makes Area 50 look like Area 49.

16:35.744 --> 16:36.954
Will I like it there?

16:37.121 --> 16:38.455
Oh, you'll love it!

16:38.455 --> 16:40.916
Unless you don't like
being dissected alive,

16:40.916 --> 16:42.710
in which case, you'll hate it.

16:42.710 --> 16:44.378
What's that? A weather balloon?

16:46.755 --> 16:48.507
No, it's a friend.

16:50.759 --> 16:52.136
I can't see anything

16:52.136 --> 16:55.347
with all this safe
and harmless crop dust.

16:56.932 --> 16:58.017
What the...

17:01.645 --> 17:02.938
Great plan, gang.

17:03.856 --> 17:06.191
I mean, I almost died, but good plan.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.276
Good, not great.

17:07.276 --> 17:08.819
Now, where's our getaway car?

17:11.905 --> 17:13.574
Okay, this plan sucks, gang.

17:16.076 --> 17:19.163
This is all the getaway we need.

17:19.163 --> 17:22.166
I'm going to get you, alien scum.

17:22.166 --> 17:24.793
Where is it? I know it's one of you.

17:24.793 --> 17:26.128
We'll never tell.

17:26.128 --> 17:28.088
And you can't take all of us.

17:28.088 --> 17:29.298
I'm taking all of you.

17:29.298 --> 17:30.799
A-kaza-kaza-wha?

17:30.924 --> 17:33.010
I don't know
which one of you is the alien.

17:33.010 --> 17:36.555
I mean, I feel pretty confident
it's one of the twins,

17:36.555 --> 17:39.725
but I'm taking you all
to Area 51 anyway.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.351
Uncle Cosworth, do something!

17:41.351 --> 17:44.772
One Bull Run Special coming up.

17:46.023 --> 17:47.191
Okay, that's not happening.

17:47.941 --> 17:49.485
I can't let you take them.

17:49.485 --> 17:50.569
It's me.

17:50.569 --> 17:51.737
I'm the one you want.

17:52.279 --> 17:54.740
Don't say anything mean about my body.

17:57.618 --> 17:59.536
Hallelujah!

17:59.536 --> 18:01.538
I cracked that man.

18:01.538 --> 18:03.082
I daddied him.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.917
Clifton, I can't believe you were

18:04.917 --> 18:07.419
hiding behind that cactus
the whole time,

18:07.419 --> 18:09.588
especially since you're
also standing right there.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.427
Great mother of pearl!

18:16.386 --> 18:17.846
Kill me. Do it.

18:20.057 --> 18:21.308
I wronged you.

18:21.308 --> 18:22.518
I killed your...

18:22.518 --> 18:24.019
I want to say, little lover?

18:24.019 --> 18:25.646
Was it a sex friend?

18:28.440 --> 18:29.858
It was your young.

18:29.858 --> 18:31.151
I was afraid of that.

18:31.151 --> 18:34.238
But before you righteously murder me,
can I say something?

18:34.822 --> 18:36.448
You and me are a lot alike.

18:36.448 --> 18:37.741
Fellow travelers.

18:37.741 --> 18:39.576
Strangers on a strange planet.

18:39.576 --> 18:42.246
A strange planet full of strange humans.

18:42.246 --> 18:43.580
They do weird stuff.

18:43.580 --> 18:44.873
Like clapping.

18:44.873 --> 18:46.208
They enjoy a thing,

18:46.208 --> 18:49.628
so they gather to look at the thing
and slap their hands together.

18:49.628 --> 18:51.255
Big, loud, slappy clomps.

18:51.255 --> 18:54.341
Dumb. In a way, the computer was right.

18:54.341 --> 18:56.426
This planet has low potential.

18:56.426 --> 18:59.263
But then I got to thinking
about the green chile pepper,

18:59.263 --> 19:03.350
full of high quantities of capsaicin,
which is a poison.

19:03.350 --> 19:04.601
But what you can't tell

19:04.601 --> 19:06.895
from your scanning tripod on the moon

19:06.895 --> 19:10.607
is that this poison is also
really spicy and flavorful.

19:10.607 --> 19:12.192
Get where I'm going with this?

19:12.317 --> 19:13.318
Huh?

19:13.318 --> 19:14.528
The people.

19:14.528 --> 19:16.572
They're like the green chile peppers.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.491
The things inside them
that they think are poison,

19:19.491 --> 19:21.869
their dark secrets
and their troubled pasts,

19:21.869 --> 19:24.496
just make them spicy and flavorful.

19:28.375 --> 19:30.127
I told you we were a lot alike.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.380
He's waking up. That's my cue!

19:40.971 --> 19:44.099
Tell everyone what you saw
here today, if you want.

19:45.058 --> 19:46.602
Who would ever believe you?

19:58.280 --> 19:59.281
He...

19:59.948 --> 20:01.366
he didn't say goodbye.

20:01.366 --> 20:03.702
To keep you safe, my friends.

20:03.702 --> 20:05.495
I don't want you to know too much.

20:05.495 --> 20:07.539
Do you think he was the alien

20:07.539 --> 20:09.499
the government was looking for?

20:09.499 --> 20:11.460
Hmm. Maybe they don't know enough.

20:30.729 --> 20:34.858
<i>And so, Roger sets off
to travel this new world,</i>

20:34.858 --> 20:37.778
<i>seeking only his pleasure and amusement,</i>

20:37.778 --> 20:39.988
<i>perhaps righting a wrong, if he has time</i>

20:39.988 --> 20:41.490
<i>and it's not a big hassle.</i>

20:42.199 --> 20:45.744
<i>All the while being pursued
by an intelligence agent,</i>

20:45.744 --> 20:47.955
<i>his smart-alecky bald son,</i>

20:47.955 --> 20:51.625
<i>and a vengeful shape-shifting alien
who seeks to destroy him.</i>

20:51.917 --> 20:54.711
<i>His date with destiny
and the Smith family</i>

20:54.711 --> 20:56.505
<i>still decades in front of him,</i>

20:56.505 --> 20:59.258
<i>he is The Fellow Traveler.</i>

20:59.258 --> 21:01.927
<i>And these are his stories.</i>
