01:31.925 --> 01:33.394

01:33.427 --> 01:36.497
- You were dreaming, I
didn't want to wake you

01:36.530 --> 01:38.632
in case it was wonderful.

01:39.600 --> 01:42.736
[breathing with effort]

01:46.540 --> 01:48.709
I thought I could make it.

Oh, don't put the book
away, yet, darling.

02:33.687 --> 02:34.522

02:40.894 --> 02:42.230
- What time's Anna coming?

02:42.263 --> 02:44.298
- After her very
important meeting's over,

02:44.332 --> 02:45.433
so who knows.

02:46.367 --> 02:47.835

02:55.843 --> 02:57.311

02:57.345 --> 02:58.746
- [Blonde In Brown]
She fell again.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.948
- Three times in one week?

03:02.350 --> 03:05.886
You gotta get something
else in that cocktail.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.857
- Bring the book
over, sweetheart.

03:12.860 --> 03:13.694
Leslie?

03:14.962 --> 03:15.863
- [Leslie] Yeah?

03:15.896 --> 03:18.332
- Can we have a few minutes?

03:19.533 --> 03:22.736
Ava and I are going
on a little journey.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.805
- We have a schedule today.

03:24.838 --> 03:25.873
Okay.

03:30.444 --> 03:31.912
- My beautiful girl.

03:35.316 --> 03:37.818
You have the face of an angel.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.253
- You have to say that.

03:39.287 --> 03:41.822
- I absolutely do not.

03:41.855 --> 03:43.891
It just happens to be true.

03:46.894 --> 03:47.928
- Age?

03:50.331 --> 03:51.832
- How about eight?

Bravo, darling.

04:08.716 --> 04:11.419
I loved it, best show yet.

04:11.452 --> 04:15.523
- Do you remember when you
used to do those shows?

04:15.556 --> 04:16.624
I loved them.

04:19.026 --> 04:21.329
- I was way too old
for imaginary friends.

04:21.362 --> 04:23.831
- Nobody's too old
for imaginary friends.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.866
We should all have them.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.537

04:46.920 --> 04:48.922
- I was so proud of you.

04:50.057 --> 04:51.792
- I came third.

04:51.825 --> 04:53.994
- Yeah, well, politics
were involved.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.863
You were clearly the best.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.998
Fucking PTA-mum clique.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.436
Not an artist among them.

[gentle guitar music]

05:17.618 --> 05:19.086
- [Voiceover] That's a lovely
idea, to see the world,

05:19.119 --> 05:21.989
a bit before you get
settled into college.

05:22.022 --> 05:24.091
It's hard to get away
once you have commitments.

05:24.124 --> 05:26.627
Just think about it.

05:26.660 --> 05:29.730
- Oh, darling [sniffling].

05:29.763 --> 05:32.566
You could still have all this.

05:32.600 --> 05:34.001
Do you know that?

05:35.669 --> 05:37.705
You will have all this.

05:37.738 --> 05:40.007
- [Blonde In Brown] I know.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.718
Mum, everything's okay.

05:51.885 --> 05:56.056
It's fine, I promise.
[Mum sobbing]

06:04.131 --> 06:07.635
- [Leslie] Ava, isn't
your sister arriving soon?

06:07.668 --> 06:08.502
- Yeah.

06:09.937 --> 06:12.773
- [Leslie] Well, we
should get ready.

06:12.806 --> 06:13.641
Yes?

06:17.811 --> 06:19.480
I picked up some more
of your Tahitian vanilla

06:19.513 --> 06:23.684
body wash, your
favorite [chuckles].

06:28.456 --> 06:29.089
Let's go.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.531
Nice and slow.

06:37.565 --> 06:38.165
- Wait, wait one moment.

06:38.198 --> 06:40.033
Where are we going?

06:40.067 --> 06:41.101
Why are you pulling at me?

06:41.134 --> 06:42.202
Get off me, get off.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.837
Ava, tell her to get off me.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.072
I don't want to do it.
- [Ava] Mum.

06:45.105 --> 06:45.973
Mum, it's okay.
- [Mum] Tell her.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.174
It's just Leslie,
she's here to help.

06:47.207 --> 06:50.043
- [Mum] Well, tell her to get
off me, you're hurting me.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.779
Don't.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.847
- Miss Faye, we're just gonna
take you to the shower, okay?

06:53.881 --> 06:55.148
- [Ava] I'm going to
be with you, okay?

06:55.182 --> 06:56.617
I'm gonna be here with
you the whole time.

06:56.650 --> 06:57.951
It's okay, it's Leslie.

06:57.985 --> 06:58.919
This is Leslie.
- [Mum] I don't want to go.

06:58.952 --> 06:59.920
- [Ava] It's Leslie.
- [Mum] I don't want to.

06:59.953 --> 07:02.723
Come on, it's Leslie,
it's Leslie, come on.

07:02.756 --> 07:03.724
It's Leslie.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.828
- It's Leslie.

07:07.861 --> 07:10.798
I'm sorry, Leslie, so sorry.

07:10.831 --> 07:14.101
- Oh, I know, it's
okay, it's okay.

07:14.134 --> 07:16.136
Let's get you washed up.

07:17.070 --> 07:17.905
Okay?

darling, you've got it.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.226
Beautiful Balance.

07:39.259 --> 07:40.928
Let's go again.

07:40.961 --> 07:43.096
Five, six, seven, eight.

07:43.130 --> 07:45.599
- [Ava] Okay, almost done.

07:53.073 --> 07:55.242
Mum, Mum, you have to eat,

07:59.012 --> 08:01.949
you have to get
your strength back.

08:02.983 --> 08:05.285
- Some things don't come back.

08:09.156 --> 08:12.092
[doors shutting]

08:14.227 --> 08:15.596
- Anna's here.

08:17.898 --> 08:18.732
- Okay.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.171
[Ava sighs]

08:35.148 --> 08:38.518
- Now I know she's
excited to see you.

08:44.992 --> 08:46.259
- [Anna] Hello.

08:48.261 --> 08:49.730
You look pretty

08:51.298 --> 08:54.201
and you smell delicious.

08:54.234 --> 08:56.103
- Hello.
- [Anna] Hi.

08:56.136 --> 08:57.971
- I'm Faye, Ava's mum.

08:59.940 --> 09:03.343
It's a real treat to
meet one of her friends.

09:03.376 --> 09:07.681
Can't remember the last time
you brought someone around.

09:13.386 --> 09:17.224
- [Ava] Mum, mum, this
is Anna, your daughter.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.728
- Mum, remember this?

09:24.665 --> 09:28.268
Look, it was my
birthday, last year.

09:28.301 --> 09:31.071
We went to the
cafe by the river.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.975
And then we walked on the beach.

09:36.143 --> 09:38.178
- Oh, yeah, of course.

09:40.247 --> 09:42.282
Looks like we had fun.

09:44.317 --> 09:45.152
- We did.

09:48.756 --> 09:52.993
Mum, I'm just gonna speak
to Ava for a minute.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.127
I'll be back.

10:03.270 --> 10:04.304
- Ava.

10:07.274 --> 10:09.710
- I'll be right back, okay?

10:11.278 --> 10:12.112
Okay.

10:21.054 --> 10:21.855
- I'll head up now.

10:21.889 --> 10:23.356
- [Ava] Thanks, Les.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.329
- [Anna] What
happened to your arm?

10:29.362 --> 10:30.831
- It's nothing.

10:30.864 --> 10:34.001
- That's the third time
she hasn't recognized me.

10:34.034 --> 10:36.770
- I live here, and
she sees me every day.

10:36.804 --> 10:37.971
- You never let me forget it.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.973
- Hey, that's not fair.

10:40.007 --> 10:40.941
You know what?

10:40.974 --> 10:42.676
I was just trying to help.

10:42.710 --> 10:44.244
I know how hard it must be.

10:44.277 --> 10:47.981
- I suppose I didn't realize
I'd have to pay such a high

10:48.015 --> 10:50.117
price for living at life.

10:52.285 --> 10:55.322
How can you do it, knowing
you have Huntington's,

10:55.355 --> 10:58.358
and the same thing is
going to happen to you?

10:58.391 --> 10:59.192
I don't understand.

10:59.226 --> 11:02.462
- Please, don't
make this about me.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.932
- I can't do what you do, Ava.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.900
I can't live my life
for someone else.

11:06.934 --> 11:09.469
- I am not asking you to, I'm
saying if you were here more

11:09.502 --> 11:11.304
then it would be--
[knocking on door]

11:11.338 --> 11:12.439
- Who's that?

11:13.440 --> 11:15.408
- Jessa's in town.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.210
- High school Jessa?

11:17.244 --> 11:19.246
- Yeah, she's staying
for a few days.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.480
- [Voiceover] Hello?

11:20.513 --> 11:21.314
- Perfect.

11:21.348 --> 11:24.284
- Hi! [laughing]

11:25.285 --> 11:26.186
[Jessa groans]

11:26.219 --> 11:27.387
- Oh, it's so good to see you.

11:27.420 --> 11:31.792
- [Jessa] It is so good
to see you [laughs].

11:31.825 --> 11:34.027
It is so good to see you!

11:34.061 --> 11:35.729
Hi!
- [Ava] Hi.

11:35.763 --> 11:38.298
- [Jessa] Hi, Anna, it's
good to see you too.

11:38.331 --> 11:39.332
- Thank you.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.201
Ava, I'm going back up.

11:41.234 --> 11:42.069
- Okay.

11:43.303 --> 11:44.371
- Are you married, now?

11:44.404 --> 11:45.739
- [Jessa] I--
- I just never

11:45.773 --> 11:47.374
pictured you with a--
- [Jessa] A man?

11:47.407 --> 11:48.408
- Anna.

11:48.441 --> 11:49.576
- [Jessa] It's okay.

11:49.609 --> 11:53.346
Um no, no man, but I did pay
for some ivy league sperm.

11:53.380 --> 11:54.414
- Oh.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.417
Well, congratulations.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.323
- [laughing] Same old Anna.

12:03.356 --> 12:04.992
- Oh, my gosh, I'm so sorry.

12:05.025 --> 12:07.360
- It's okay, wouldn't
have it any other way.

12:07.394 --> 12:11.198
- She's having a tough
time dealing with mum.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.100
- How is your wonderful mother?

12:13.133 --> 12:16.436
I missed her almost
as much as I miss you.

12:18.471 --> 12:21.441
- Things have changed a
lot in the last month.

12:21.474 --> 12:24.778
So, we expected it,
but still it's hard.

12:26.079 --> 12:29.883
- Ava, I am so sorry I
haven't been back more.

12:29.917 --> 12:32.019
- Hey, I don't blame you.

12:33.987 --> 12:37.757
I mean, we couldn't
wait to get out of here.

12:38.926 --> 12:39.526
- [Jessa] Ava.

12:39.559 --> 12:40.560
- It's okay.

12:44.431 --> 12:45.532
You look um--

12:46.967 --> 12:48.201
- Pregnant?

12:48.235 --> 12:51.471
[both laughing]

12:51.504 --> 12:53.340
- Leslie, this is Jessa.

12:53.373 --> 12:55.275
- Hi, nice to meet you.

12:55.308 --> 12:56.143
- Oh!

12:57.845 --> 13:00.013
You look prettier
than your pictures.

13:00.047 --> 13:00.881
- Oh.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.384
- Thank you.

13:04.417 --> 13:06.319
- Do you want to
come say hi to mum?

13:06.353 --> 13:07.888
- Yeah, yeah, I would love that.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.990
It was nice to meet you.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.959
Yeah, come on, come on.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.533
- And so how's the boyfriend?

13:20.567 --> 13:22.035
- Mark.
- [Faye] Mark, that's right.

13:22.069 --> 13:24.537
- He's great, thanks,
Mum, thanks for asking.

13:24.571 --> 13:27.307
He's um, he's really
special, actually,

13:27.340 --> 13:28.541
and I would love
you to meet him.

13:28.575 --> 13:32.445
I wanted him to come on this
trip but he just, he couldn't.

13:32.479 --> 13:34.481
But there's some more
good news, I've been dying

13:34.514 --> 13:35.582
to tell you about all this.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.084
I've been promoted, at work.

13:37.117 --> 13:38.418
- Oh my goodness!
- [Anna] Yeah.

13:38.451 --> 13:39.519
- That's fantastic!
- [Anna] Thank you.

13:39.552 --> 13:41.454
They keep me so busy.
- [Ava] Mum?

13:41.488 --> 13:43.623
Jessa's here for a visit.

13:43.656 --> 13:44.491
Can she come say hi?

13:44.524 --> 13:45.926
- Jessa!

13:45.959 --> 13:47.227
Of course, come in!

13:47.260 --> 13:48.361
- [Jessa] Hi.

13:49.496 --> 13:50.397
How are you?

13:50.430 --> 13:53.100
Oh, I've missed your hugs.

13:53.133 --> 13:54.167
- Let me look at you.

13:54.201 --> 13:55.535
Oh, my goodness!

13:55.568 --> 13:57.104

26:25.417 --> 26:26.719
This is impossible.

26:26.753 --> 26:29.622
- This is impossible [giggles].

26:29.656 --> 26:31.290
- I am dreaming.

26:31.323 --> 26:33.225
This is a dream, thank goodness.

26:33.259 --> 26:34.160
- Why is that?

26:34.193 --> 26:35.995
- Because I can wake myself up.

26:36.028 --> 26:38.130
- Why would you want to
go, Ava, you just got here.

26:38.164 --> 26:39.899
We haven't had any fun, yet.

26:39.932 --> 26:43.169
- My mother needs me,
I have to help her.

26:44.837 --> 26:48.007
- By help her, you
mean help yourself.

26:49.141 --> 26:51.811
- How would you know
about my mother?

26:51.844 --> 26:56.015
- Ava, all of your questions
will be answered in time.

26:56.048 --> 26:57.717
- I don't have time.

27:00.352 --> 27:03.022
- [Lumi] Now for
the belly, okay.

27:03.055 --> 27:05.725
[Emma laughing]

27:07.126 --> 27:08.027
Okay.

27:08.060 --> 27:08.961
Oh, my: 41.

27:10.296 --> 27:11.831
- [Woman In Red] Yes, that one.

27:11.864 --> 27:12.732
I like that one.

27:12.765 --> 27:13.933
[Claire laughing]

27:13.966 --> 27:14.801
Beautiful.

27:15.968 --> 27:18.905
[low violin music]

27:28.881 --> 27:30.649
- Okay, I'll wake up.

27:33.252 --> 27:35.988
- Nothing is what
it seems to be.

27:47.266 --> 27:49.168
[panting]

27:49.201 --> 27:52.805
[suspenseful techno music]

28:02.181 --> 28:06.085
[ethereal keyboard music]

28:06.118 --> 28:09.688
[suspenseful techno music]

28:17.196 --> 28:20.299
- Running away never
solves anything.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.970
- You're here, so deal with it.

28:25.004 --> 28:27.473
- If only the answers were easy.

28:29.141 --> 28:32.879
- Nothing is easy, there is
no way out, so just give up.

28:35.147 --> 28:39.318
- Just take a deep breath
and accept you're here.

28:39.351 --> 28:42.354
You're going to
feel so much better.

28:45.557 --> 28:49.128
- Did you get that
out of your system?

28:49.161 --> 28:53.332
Ava, you can't leave here until
you do what you came to do.

28:54.366 --> 28:55.167
- And what is that?

28:55.201 --> 28:58.170
- Only you know
the answer to that.

28:58.204 --> 29:00.807
Well, that's not entirely true.

29:00.840 --> 29:05.778
I know, but telling you
would take the fun out of it.

29:05.812 --> 29:09.381
I guess we should get ready
for Claire's going-away party.

29:09.415 --> 29:11.317
- Wait, Claire's going away?

29:11.350 --> 29:12.384
- Yes.

29:14.253 --> 29:16.122
Tonight is her
last night with us.

29:16.155 --> 29:17.256
- Why is she leaving?

29:17.289 --> 29:18.357
- It doesn't matter why.

29:18.390 --> 29:20.359
- Of course it matters, why
would you even say that?

29:20.392 --> 29:23.095
- 'Cause she's already
made her mind up.

29:23.129 --> 29:25.297
- M-maybe I can change it.

29:29.401 --> 29:31.237
- Whoa.

29:31.270 --> 29:32.204
Hey.

29:32.238 --> 29:34.907
What's going on with you, today?

29:35.541 --> 29:36.976
You okay?

29:37.009 --> 29:39.378
Look at me, take a breath.

29:39.411 --> 29:41.580
[breathing together]

29:41.613 --> 29:43.115
Good, again.

29:43.149 --> 29:45.217
[breathing together]

29:45.251 --> 29:46.318
Okay, it's okay.

29:46.352 --> 29:47.586
- It's not.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.588
I don't know what
I'm doing here.

29:49.621 --> 29:52.458
[pensive orchestral music]

29:52.491 --> 29:53.425
This place isn't real.

29:54.493 --> 29:55.394
This is not real.

29:55.427 --> 29:56.395
It's not real.

29:56.428 --> 29:58.197
- Ava.
- [Ava] It's not real.

29:58.230 --> 30:00.799
- Ava, Ava, come with me, okay?

30:02.468 --> 30:04.170
Look at me, Ava.

30:04.203 --> 30:05.804
Come with me, okay?

30:07.173 --> 30:08.474
Come on.

30:08.507 --> 30:11.878
[gentle guitar music]

30:13.445 --> 30:16.348
Tell me the truth, what's wrong?

30:16.382 --> 30:18.417
- I'm afraid you're
gonna think I'm crazy.

30:18.450 --> 30:20.819
- It's okay, I like crazy.

30:25.391 --> 30:28.494
- I'm, I'm just sad
Claire's leaving.

30:28.527 --> 30:30.529
Heartbroken, actually.

30:30.562 --> 30:32.364
- I thought you would
understand her choice

30:32.398 --> 30:33.199
more than anyone.

30:33.232 --> 30:34.400
- Why?

30:34.433 --> 30:37.036
- Because you always
want people to be happy,

30:37.069 --> 30:38.604
that's just who you are.

30:38.637 --> 30:40.839
- But, she's happy here.

30:42.041 --> 30:44.510
- She has been,
but things change.

30:44.543 --> 30:45.878
People evolve.

30:45.912 --> 30:47.113
- She has obligations.

30:47.146 --> 30:48.881
To us, to me.

30:48.915 --> 30:50.516
- Obligations, wow.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.085
Is that really how you feel?

30:53.119 --> 30:53.953
Yeah.

30:55.687 --> 30:58.624
- Can I ask you a question?

30:58.657 --> 31:00.893
Are you not happy with us?

31:00.927 --> 31:02.428
Because you've been
acting really weird

31:02.461 --> 31:03.562
and I would hate to
think that you're with me

31:03.595 --> 31:04.897
out of obligation.

31:04.931 --> 31:07.299
- No, that's not what I said.

31:07.333 --> 31:11.337
- Okay, well, I'm just
trying to understand you.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.074
Ava.

31:17.709 --> 31:20.212
[suspenseful piano music]

31:20.246 --> 31:21.080
Ava.

31:24.483 --> 31:28.654
- I'm, I'm sorry, I wasn't,
I wasn't talking about us.

31:31.490 --> 31:32.291
- Okay.

31:35.561 --> 31:37.463
- I've just been really--

31:41.667 --> 31:43.402
[Sweet P coughing]

31:43.435 --> 31:45.171
- Don't ever do that!

31:46.305 --> 31:47.573
Ever.

31:47.606 --> 31:49.441
- Ava, could you come
outside for a moment?

31:49.475 --> 31:50.509
- Uh.

31:52.011 --> 31:54.680
- You were going
to speak to Claire.

31:54.713 --> 31:58.450
Was I the only one in this
conversation a minute ago?

31:58.484 --> 32:00.252
- No, right, yes, um.

32:02.621 --> 32:05.324
I have to speak to Claire,
are you gonna be okay

32:05.357 --> 32:06.325
for a while?

32:07.226 --> 32:09.061
- Yeah, no, it's okay.

32:15.701 --> 32:18.470
- Hey, you coulda
told me about Emma.

32:18.504 --> 32:20.172
We're together?

32:20.206 --> 32:23.042
- It's your dream,
I thought you knew.

32:23.075 --> 32:25.544
- I don't know anything
about this place.

32:25.577 --> 32:29.581
- Ava, you know everything
about this place.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.550
You created it.

32:31.583 --> 32:32.518
Just focus.

32:36.255 --> 32:39.425
[gentle string music]

32:42.128 --> 32:44.563
[Claire sighs contentedly]

32:44.596 --> 32:47.966
[gentle string music]

32:53.239 --> 32:56.075
- Ava, come, come
and sit with me.

33:04.716 --> 33:06.152
Would you like some?

33:06.185 --> 33:09.121
Lumi made it this morning and--

33:09.155 --> 33:09.988
Darling.

33:11.557 --> 33:12.558
- I'm sorry.

33:14.126 --> 33:15.394
- Hard day?

33:15.427 --> 33:16.262
- Yeah.

33:17.696 --> 33:21.667
- Come on, eat something,
you'll love it, it's delicious.

33:23.135 --> 33:23.769
Go on.

33:25.604 --> 33:28.574
[gentle string music]

33:35.647 --> 33:37.683
- Why are you leaving?

33:39.218 --> 33:42.054
[Claire sighs]

33:42.088 --> 33:43.322
- Are you looking for
a different answer

33:43.355 --> 33:45.424
than the last dozen
times you've asked?

33:45.457 --> 33:47.593
- This is different.

33:47.626 --> 33:48.760
It's me, asking.

33:51.863 --> 33:52.698
- Oh.

33:55.701 --> 33:57.703
- I'm not sick.

33:57.736 --> 34:00.372
I mean I don't think I am.

34:00.406 --> 34:01.673
I honestly don't know.

34:01.707 --> 34:03.075
Look, I just--

34:04.310 --> 34:05.744
I need an answer.

34:07.179 --> 34:11.417
- If there was only a way that
both of you could be happy.

34:11.449 --> 34:13.518
- There must be an
answer, Ava, you just have

34:13.552 --> 34:15.587
to work harder to find it.

34:15.621 --> 34:19.391
- The answer is right here, and
you already know what it is.

34:19.425 --> 34:21.193
- Oh, please, give
that shit a rest.

34:21.226 --> 34:22.761
It's really just a
lose-lose situation, here.

34:22.793 --> 34:24.429
That's what we have.

34:24.463 --> 34:26.665
- I feel so small right now.

34:26.697 --> 34:29.235
Can anyone actually see me?

34:29.268 --> 34:31.137
Ava, do you feel it, too?

34:32.504 --> 34:35.141
Ava!
- [Ava] Look, stop.

34:35.174 --> 34:36.574
I don't mean to be rude,

34:36.608 --> 34:39.210
but can you just leave us alone?

34:39.245 --> 34:41.580
- But you didn't
answer my question.

34:41.612 --> 34:42.681
Did you even hear it?

34:42.714 --> 34:44.550
Can you see me?

34:44.583 --> 34:47.686
- Ladies, all of
you, inside, please.

34:51.822 --> 34:52.824
- It's time.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.762
- You can't just say it's
time and expect everyone

34:56.795 --> 34:58.730
to be okay with that.

35:02.634 --> 35:04.870
You must, you must have
unfinished business,

35:04.903 --> 35:07.673
things to do here, right.

35:07.706 --> 35:10.842
- I've take care of
my responsibilities.

35:10.876 --> 35:13.745
- Is there any, is
there anything I can do

35:13.779 --> 35:15.814
to change your mind?

35:15.847 --> 35:17.216
- There is something
you can do for me.

35:17.249 --> 35:18.684
- If I do it, you'll stay?

35:18.717 --> 35:20.619
- [scoffs] I'm not making
a deal with you, Ava.

35:20.652 --> 35:22.388
I'm trying to help you.

35:22.421 --> 35:24.756
- But you'll think about it.

35:24.790 --> 35:26.625
- Listen, I know you
and Freya are going

35:26.658 --> 35:28.727
through a really hard time.

35:28.760 --> 35:31.497
But you've got to move past it.

35:31.530 --> 35:32.531
Talk to her.

35:33.699 --> 35:35.667
This has gone on long enough.

35:35.701 --> 35:37.936
- Talk about what?

35:37.969 --> 35:40.706
- It would mean a lot to me.

35:40.739 --> 35:41.807
Just try, okay?

35:59.258 --> 35:59.891
- Hey.

36:02.461 --> 36:04.796
Somebody's gotta
make the first move.

36:04.830 --> 36:06.698
Might as well be you.

36:07.833 --> 36:08.467
Come on.

36:11.403 --> 36:13.905
- Why is Freya so angry at me?

36:16.275 --> 36:19.778
- A heart-felt apology
will go a long way.

36:20.979 --> 36:21.813
Come on.

36:24.850 --> 36:28.554
[somber orchestral music]

36:29.621 --> 36:30.856
- [Freya] What?

36:31.923 --> 36:33.492
- Are you a writer?

36:33.525 --> 36:36.695
- For heaven's sake,
why are you here?

36:37.896 --> 36:40.332
- To talk about our issues.

36:44.403 --> 36:45.237
- Waiting.

36:46.672 --> 36:47.673
- I'm sorry.

36:49.808 --> 36:53.879
- All I guess is: Claire's
asked you to apologize.

36:53.912 --> 36:55.581
Can't believe your nerve.

36:55.614 --> 36:57.349
- She didn't.

36:57.383 --> 36:59.585
It's me, I'm apologizing.

36:59.618 --> 37:00.752
- Uh huh.

37:00.786 --> 37:02.688
For what, exactly?

37:02.721 --> 37:03.822
- Everything.

37:04.723 --> 37:06.024
- Oh, my God.

37:06.057 --> 37:09.728
You don't really think
you're wrong, do you?

37:09.761 --> 37:12.431
You just want to
make Claire happy so

37:12.464 --> 37:15.367
that you can be
the good one again.

37:16.067 --> 37:19.505

37:51.903 --> 37:53.004
- [Lumi] Take what you want.

37:53.038 --> 37:56.975

but why are we fighting?

37:57.008 --> 37:58.377
[Lumi breathes out hard]

minute, then the next--

38:06.385 --> 38:09.955
Why are you asking
me, it's your fight.

38:09.988 --> 38:10.989
- I'm sorry.

38:12.524 --> 38:14.526
It's been a strange day.

38:17.563 --> 38:21.767
- So much time has been
wasted and you're never

38:21.800 --> 38:24.370
gonna get it back, Ava.

38:24.403 --> 38:26.738
Just focus on what you want.

38:29.007 --> 38:31.042
And then move forward.

[gentle string music]

38:36.882 --> 38:37.716
- Hey.

38:39.585 --> 38:40.886
Close your eyes.

38:40.919 --> 38:41.853
- Why?

38:41.887 --> 38:42.954
- Just do it.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.661

38:49.695 --> 38:50.796
That's right.

I always find it.

Why you lookin' at me like
you've never seen me before?

39:11.182 --> 39:13.018
- I'm not sure I have.

39:13.952 --> 39:17.956
- [snorts softly] That's sweet.

39:20.992 --> 39:24.696
- I'm sorry, it's been
a overwhelming day.

39:25.931 --> 39:28.099
- It's okay, I understand.

39:31.737 --> 39:34.072
You relax and I'll be
back in a minute, okay?

39:34.105 --> 39:38.076
And save me a
chocolate one [kisses].

40:03.502 --> 40:05.737
- You dance so beautifully.

40:07.105 --> 40:08.640
- Come.

Dance with me.

- Yeah.

58:24.134 --> 58:26.036
- [Emma] Okay, come on.

58:38.816 --> 58:39.950
- [Ava] Here, let me
help you with that.

58:39.984 --> 58:40.785
- I'm fine, Ava.

58:40.818 --> 58:42.286
Just leave me alone.

58:45.022 --> 58:46.757
I can do it myself.

58:46.791 --> 58:49.193
- I was thinking about
what you said, earlier.

58:49.226 --> 58:50.127
- Oh, God.

58:50.160 --> 58:52.029
- And I wanted to apologize.

58:52.062 --> 58:53.063
- Just stop.

58:53.097 --> 58:55.532
- I'm jealous, I was jealous.

58:57.968 --> 59:01.271
You were strong enough
to say what you want,

59:01.305 --> 59:02.707
when you wanted it

59:02.740 --> 59:05.075
and I've always been afraid.

59:06.210 --> 59:10.280
I can't blame you for
wanting to stand on your own.

59:11.115 --> 59:13.283
- Do you really mean that?

59:14.151 --> 59:16.120
- More than you know.

59:20.057 --> 59:22.192
- I don't know what to say.

59:22.226 --> 59:25.195
- You don't have
to say anything,

59:25.229 --> 59:27.732
I just wanted to let you know.

59:30.134 --> 59:32.670
- I've been jealous of you too.

59:32.703 --> 59:33.904
- Why?

59:33.938 --> 59:36.040
- Because everyone
loves and adores you

59:36.073 --> 59:38.575
and things come easily to you.

59:40.144 --> 59:44.281
You don't know how hard
it is to keep up with you.

59:44.314 --> 59:47.985
- I didn't know
you felt like that.

59:48.018 --> 59:48.853
- Well.

59:53.290 --> 59:55.159
- Can we start over?

59:57.762 --> 01:00:00.765
[soft guitar music]

01:00:03.433 --> 01:00:05.803
Let me help you with this.

01:00:12.242 --> 01:00:13.277
- Thanks.

01:00:22.252 --> 01:00:23.754
This feels normal.

01:00:26.691 --> 01:00:27.324
- It does.

01:00:29.059 --> 01:00:30.961
I've missed it so much.

01:00:32.296 --> 01:00:33.297
- Me too.

01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:40.437
- [Voiceover] Excuse me.

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:41.839
- I'm so excited that
Claire's heading off

01:00:41.872 --> 01:00:43.140
on this new adventure.

01:00:43.173 --> 01:00:45.009
- I can't believe
she's leaving us.

01:00:45.042 --> 01:00:47.011
- [Voiceover] Look, she
must have a good reason.

01:00:47.044 --> 01:00:50.080
- [Voiceover] Whatever it
is, it's not good enough.

01:00:50.114 --> 01:00:51.381
- I have to go.

01:00:52.382 --> 01:00:53.884
You gonna be at
the party, later?

01:00:53.918 --> 01:00:55.285
- [Freya] Yeah,
I'll see you there.

01:00:55.319 --> 01:00:56.353
- Okay.

01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:01.091
- Oh, Ava.

01:01:01.125 --> 01:01:02.960
You must watch
where you're going,

01:01:02.993 --> 01:01:05.195
I wouldn't want you to bump
your head and end up in a dream.

01:01:05.229 --> 01:01:07.297
A dream within a dream, now
that would take some time

01:01:07.331 --> 01:01:08.332
to get out of.

01:01:08.365 --> 01:01:10.968
- I have to find Claire.

01:01:11.001 --> 01:01:12.202
- There you are.

01:01:12.236 --> 01:01:14.271
I just wanted to make sure that
you're ready for your toast.

01:01:14.304 --> 01:01:15.472
- My what?

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:16.941
- Well, I know how close
you are with Claire,

01:01:16.974 --> 01:01:20.044
so I figured that you'd
want to do the honors.

01:01:20.077 --> 01:01:23.380
You know, say something
nice or wish her good luck

01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:24.882
on her journey.

01:01:24.915 --> 01:01:26.483
It's called a toast.

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:28.418
- I know what a toast is.

01:01:28.452 --> 01:01:29.286
- Okay

01:01:32.389 --> 01:01:33.223
- Curious.

01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:39.396
- Who's gonna take care
of us when Claire leaves?

01:01:39.429 --> 01:01:41.866
I don't know who
we are without her.

01:01:41.899 --> 01:01:44.368
Can you stop her for us?

01:01:44.401 --> 01:01:48.005
She's the only one that
really ever loved me

01:01:48.038 --> 01:01:49.706
and it hurts so bad.

01:01:51.441 --> 01:01:53.277
Ava, are you listening to me?

01:01:53.310 --> 01:01:54.812
Ava?

01:01:54.845 --> 01:01:55.479
Ava, wait.

01:01:58.783 --> 01:01:59.784
[groaning]

01:01:59.817 --> 01:02:01.451
- [Ava] Where are you?

01:02:03.821 --> 01:02:06.123
Oh my God, what's happening?

01:02:08.225 --> 01:02:09.794
- I'm so sorry.

01:02:09.827 --> 01:02:11.261
- Can I help you?

01:02:12.362 --> 01:02:13.463
- Don't tell anyone.

01:02:13.497 --> 01:02:14.298
- [Ava] About what?

01:02:14.331 --> 01:02:15.399
- About this.

01:02:18.168 --> 01:02:19.536
I need to leave here.

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:23.340
With everyone knowing
me as I really am.

01:02:23.373 --> 01:02:24.341
Not like this.

01:02:25.475 --> 01:02:26.844
I will not be a burden.

01:02:26.877 --> 01:02:28.946
- But I love you,
you're not a burden.

01:02:28.979 --> 01:02:30.981
- No, the show will end.

01:02:32.182 --> 01:02:35.219
It can't, Ava, it
can't, it mustn't.

01:02:35.252 --> 01:02:37.187
Do you understand?

01:02:37.221 --> 01:02:38.255
Promise me!

01:02:38.288 --> 01:02:39.289
- I promise.

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:45.462
What are you looking for?

01:02:45.495 --> 01:02:46.931
- I dropped a
bottle when I fell.

01:02:46.964 --> 01:02:48.032
I dropped it.

01:02:51.401 --> 01:02:52.036
I need it.

01:02:53.503 --> 01:02:54.371
- [Ava] There's nothing left.

01:02:54.404 --> 01:02:55.772
- It's enough.

01:02:57.842 --> 01:02:59.209
[groaning]

01:02:59.243 --> 01:03:02.346
[slow chiming music]

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:16.026
- What just happened?

01:03:17.061 --> 01:03:17.895
- Ava.

01:03:20.430 --> 01:03:21.531
I have to go.

01:03:23.868 --> 01:03:26.270
I can't stay here any longer.

01:03:27.437 --> 01:03:31.308
But even though I'm
going, you won't be alone.

01:03:34.211 --> 01:03:35.880
You'll be all right.

01:03:35.913 --> 01:03:36.546
I promise.

01:03:39.283 --> 01:03:40.584
Do you understand?

01:03:44.488 --> 01:03:46.256
You won't be alone.

01:03:53.363 --> 01:03:55.065
Come on, darling.

01:03:55.099 --> 01:03:56.466
Everyone's waiting.

01:04:07.177 --> 01:04:08.378
[all chattering]

01:04:08.412 --> 01:04:11.548
- Guys, we have
to wait for Claire

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:13.517
Okay, Oh, Sweet P

01:04:13.550 --> 01:04:14.451
- [Voiceover] Oh, look.

01:04:14.484 --> 01:04:17.487
- She's here, she's here.

01:04:17.521 --> 01:04:19.523
- [Voiceover] Beautiful.

01:04:22.292 --> 01:04:23.560
- [Claire] Oh, thank you.

01:04:23.593 --> 01:04:24.461
- Miss Claire.

01:04:24.494 --> 01:04:26.430
- [All] Cheers, cheers.

01:04:28.232 --> 01:04:29.566
- I've changed my mind.

01:04:29.599 --> 01:04:30.567
- You're allowed.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.469
- Claire has to leave.

01:04:32.502 --> 01:04:34.571
- Ava, this is not news.

01:04:34.604 --> 01:04:37.241
- I'm not gonna try and
keep her here any longer.

01:04:37.274 --> 01:04:39.910
I was only thinkin' of myself.

01:04:39.944 --> 01:04:41.478
I have to find another
way to go home.

01:04:41.511 --> 01:04:42.512
- Wonderful.

01:04:42.546 --> 01:04:45.482
- [clears throat]
It's time, Ava.

01:04:45.515 --> 01:04:46.616
- Yes, it is.

01:04:47.551 --> 01:04:49.153
- You'll be fine.

01:04:50.054 --> 01:04:50.887
- I know.

01:04:53.323 --> 01:04:56.093
[all chattering]

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:06.503
- Can I have everyone's
attention, please.

01:05:06.536 --> 01:05:09.039
I would like to say something.

01:05:10.474 --> 01:05:13.610
I heard my mother
make this toast, once.

01:05:17.114 --> 01:05:20.550
Surrender to what is,
let go of what was,

01:05:24.454 --> 01:05:27.057
and have faith in what will be.

01:05:29.459 --> 01:05:30.294
To Claire

01:05:31.295 --> 01:05:32.596
- [All] To Claire!

01:05:33.497 --> 01:05:34.498
- To Claire.

01:05:36.466 --> 01:05:38.102
- [Voiceover] Delicious!
[laughter]

01:05:38.135 --> 01:05:39.603
[overlapping chatter]
- [Voiceover] Can we eat now?

01:05:39.636 --> 01:05:41.471
- Alright, everybody, let
me get the serving utensils

01:05:41.505 --> 01:05:43.707
but you can start
on the other things.

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:44.541
[guests chattering]

01:05:44.574 --> 01:05:46.210
- [Voiceover] Fabulous.

01:05:46.243 --> 01:05:47.644
- [Voiceover] Yeah, you
guys always just cut me out.

01:05:47.677 --> 01:05:48.678
- [Voiceover] Yeah,
because you were depressed.

01:05:48.712 --> 01:05:51.648
- I'm going to
miss you, so much.

01:05:55.552 --> 01:05:59.723
I want you to know that I
respect your brave decision

01:06:02.626 --> 01:06:03.627
to leave us.

01:06:05.229 --> 01:06:07.331
I know it's what you want.

01:06:11.701 --> 01:06:15.672
I just wish I had given you
more time when I had the chance.

01:06:18.342 --> 01:06:22.712
- We always wish we had more
time with those we love.

01:06:22.746 --> 01:06:25.115
I will always be with you.

01:06:27.051 --> 01:06:29.586
And we will see
each other again.

01:06:47.471 --> 01:06:48.572
- Hey.

01:06:48.605 --> 01:06:49.739
- [Emma] That was really lovely.

01:06:49.773 --> 01:06:51.241
- Thank you.

01:06:51.275 --> 01:06:52.676
- I'm proud of you.

01:07:00.217 --> 01:07:03.653
[wind whistling quietly]

01:07:11.161 --> 01:07:13.730
[pensive guitar]

01:07:42.759 --> 01:07:46.696
[guitar and piano harmonizing]

01:08:02.812 --> 01:08:06.283
- I have never seen
you look so beautiful.

01:08:07.417 --> 01:08:08.252
- Ava

01:08:13.623 --> 01:08:15.659
- Thank you for everything.

01:08:20.197 --> 01:08:20.830
I love you

01:08:23.667 --> 01:08:24.868
- I love you too.

01:08:27.504 --> 01:08:30.240
[crying quietly]

01:08:32.509 --> 01:08:35.345
[slow piano tune]

01:08:55.432 --> 01:08:59.435
[piano and strings harmonizing]

01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:43.912
[tender piano solo]

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:56.226
- Leslie, thank you, so much,
for all that you've done.

01:09:59.263 --> 01:10:00.530
We're very grateful.

01:10:00.564 --> 01:10:01.565
- You're welcome.

01:10:01.598 --> 01:10:03.233
- Thank you, so, so much.

01:10:03.267 --> 01:10:04.968
- Spending this time
with your mother

01:10:05.001 --> 01:10:08.972
has been easily one
of the greatest gifts.

01:10:09.005 --> 01:10:12.842
I mean if anybody should
be grateful, it's me.

01:10:17.013 --> 01:10:18.548
- Incredible, right?

01:10:18.582 --> 01:10:20.717
So much love for your mother.

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:23.853
- Yeah, there were stories
I had never heard, before.

01:10:23.887 --> 01:10:26.590
Some quite surprising.

01:10:26.623 --> 01:10:27.891
- She was more rebellious
than she let on,

01:10:27.924 --> 01:10:28.725
that's for sure.

01:10:28.758 --> 01:10:29.693
- Yeah.

01:10:29.726 --> 01:10:30.794
- I'm still picturing
her dancing topless

01:10:30.827 --> 01:10:32.429
at The Who concert.

01:10:32.462 --> 01:10:34.864
[all laughing]

01:10:35.999 --> 01:10:36.800
- Hey

01:10:36.833 --> 01:10:37.834
- Hi.

01:10:37.867 --> 01:10:39.002
- How you doing?

01:10:40.837 --> 01:10:42.739
- I'm so happy you stayed.

01:10:42.772 --> 01:10:46.009
- Yeah, of course,
where else would I be?

01:10:48.578 --> 01:10:50.980
- You know, I had a
dream about you recently.

01:10:51.014 --> 01:10:52.649
- Oh, yeah?

01:10:52.682 --> 01:10:53.517
- Yeah.

01:10:57.587 --> 01:10:59.689
- I'd really like you to
consider coming to Colorado

01:10:59.723 --> 01:11:00.557
with me.

01:11:02.025 --> 01:11:03.327
- Now?

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.829
- Yeah, I mean no [laughs].

01:11:05.862 --> 01:11:07.063
I mean not this second.

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:08.965
I know you've got stuff
you've gotta wrap up,

01:11:08.998 --> 01:11:10.400
but yeah.

01:11:10.434 --> 01:11:12.536
Just like we planned
five years ago,

01:11:12.569 --> 01:11:14.571
but with an added bonus.

01:11:19.876 --> 01:11:21.545
- I would love that.

01:11:24.414 --> 01:11:28.051
But five years ago, we
didn't know I was sick.

01:11:29.586 --> 01:11:31.921
And now I have a time-stamp.

01:11:33.089 --> 01:11:35.992
- Ava, everybody
has a time-stamp.

01:11:36.025 --> 01:11:38.027
Not even you know when yours is.

01:11:38.061 --> 01:11:39.963
I don't know when
mine is, so who cares?

01:11:39.996 --> 01:11:43.733
Let's just live our life
like everybody else.

01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:51.975
[tender orchestral music]

01:11:52.008 --> 01:11:53.009
[clearing throat]
