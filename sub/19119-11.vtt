00:01.102 --> 00:02.036
-Previously on Outsiders...
-As you know,

00:02.070 --> 00:05.039
the coal company have
poisoned our fields.

00:05.073 --> 00:07.575
Those snakes intend to
starve us off the mountain.

00:07.608 --> 00:09.677
-So I think we get one of 'em
up here. -(Haylie screaming)

00:10.844 --> 00:12.080
G'WIN:
You must be thirsty.

00:13.747 --> 00:16.250
-Wait! -Hey, you promised
she'd drink the water.

00:16.284 --> 00:17.751
If she knew about the water,
she would not have

00:17.785 --> 00:18.552
raised the jar to her lips.

00:18.586 --> 00:20.421
HAYLIE:
Could I have my phone?

00:20.454 --> 00:22.356
There's no way
it's gonna work up here,

00:22.390 --> 00:24.192
I just would like
to take a picture.

00:24.225 --> 00:26.060
-You know who that is?
-LIL FOSTER: I've seen him

00:26.094 --> 00:27.561
-that day that he was shot,
yeah. -Shot by who?

00:27.595 --> 00:28.762
Foster Farrell VI.

00:28.796 --> 00:31.565
Man who was killed, Breece
Dobbs, he was my brother-in-law.

00:31.599 --> 00:33.367
I need to know the whereabouts
of the man who killed him.

00:33.401 --> 00:34.635
He's a big man.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.204
Long white hair.

00:36.237 --> 00:38.472
That's one of the coal devils.

00:38.506 --> 00:40.341
She needs to drink the water
that killed Silas!

00:40.374 --> 00:42.676
G'WIN: This was our
best spring, poisoned.

00:42.710 --> 00:44.112
Who did this?

00:44.145 --> 00:45.513
Your coal company.

00:45.546 --> 00:47.115
I promise I won't sell anything,

00:47.148 --> 00:48.816
but you got to pay for
half the lookouts.

00:48.849 --> 00:50.351
Come on, we got a deal?

00:51.452 --> 00:52.786
Well, all right.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.188
Miss?

00:54.222 --> 00:55.356
You all right?

01:04.498 --> 01:06.434
*

01:12.140 --> 01:13.774
You're welcome.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.420
MEYERS: We just got to be ready
is all I'm saying, right?

01:26.454 --> 01:28.156
So I don't want to get
caught flat-footed.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.257
That's gonna be good for no...

01:29.290 --> 01:30.858
HAYLIE:
You, get out.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.193
Hang up the phone.

01:32.226 --> 01:35.163
Holy shit. Uh... yeah.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.797
I-I got to jump, Frank.
I'll call you later.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.799
Where have you been?
What the hell happened to you?

01:38.832 --> 01:40.801
Let's not talk about me, Matt.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.570
-Let's talk about you.
-Are you okay?

01:42.603 --> 01:44.605
You know, to be honest
with you, I never really

01:44.638 --> 01:46.774
thought much of you;
just some mid-level management

01:46.807 --> 01:48.209
forehead in a suit.

01:48.242 --> 01:49.843
But I underestimated you.

01:49.877 --> 01:52.213
This whole time
I'm thinking you're nobody,

01:52.246 --> 01:54.515
and you're a full-blown
murdering sociopath.

01:54.548 --> 01:56.750
Okay, I don't know what happened
to you, but clearly you're...

01:56.784 --> 01:58.886
I know what you did, Matt.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.257
What's that?

02:03.291 --> 02:06.227
The end of your career.

02:06.260 --> 02:07.895
(country blues music playing)

02:09.863 --> 02:13.601
* The dawn is up,
there's fire on the mountain *

02:13.634 --> 02:18.206
* They'll have to answer
for their crooked claim *

02:18.239 --> 02:21.275
* The hollows
they'll surround them *

02:21.309 --> 02:23.777
* And they'll go running back

02:23.811 --> 02:26.814
* To the wretched realm
they came *

02:29.483 --> 02:35.423
* Nor will the dogs
of hell refrain *

02:35.456 --> 02:37.858
* And the land

02:37.891 --> 02:41.495
* Will suffer those who came.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.736
You're kind of
talking in riddles,

02:48.769 --> 02:50.271
so I'm not really following you.

02:50.304 --> 02:52.873
HAYLIE: You know what?
That stupid fence.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.608
Now I understand
what it was really about.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.777
You weren't trying
to keep the Farrells in,

02:56.810 --> 02:58.812
you were trying to keep
everybody else out,

02:58.846 --> 03:00.881
so they wouldn't find out
what you're doing up there.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.650
And what am I doing?

03:02.683 --> 03:04.252
You're killing them, Matt.

03:04.285 --> 03:06.654
You poisoned their water

03:06.687 --> 03:08.389
-and their crops.
-Who told you that?

03:08.422 --> 03:09.957
Nobody told me, I know.

03:09.990 --> 03:11.525
You murdered one of
their children, Matt.

03:11.559 --> 03:13.394
You were up there?
Is that where you went?

03:13.427 --> 03:15.396
-That is not important.
-No, it is important to me.

03:15.429 --> 03:18.266
And it might be important
to One Planet.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.568
I'm sure Don Foushee would be
very interested to know

03:20.601 --> 03:22.570
that his star employee
snuck off and got chummy

03:22.603 --> 03:24.572
with the people
we're trying to fight against.

03:24.605 --> 03:25.906
Are you threatening me, Matt?

03:25.939 --> 03:27.475
I don't know what
to think, honey, okay?

03:27.508 --> 03:29.410
First it was the e-mail leak...

03:29.443 --> 03:31.879
HAYLIE: You know I had nothing
to do with that.

03:31.912 --> 03:35.316
Oh, just admit that
you did it. Admit it.

03:35.349 --> 03:38.486
And while you're at it,
if you're so eager to call Don,

03:38.519 --> 03:39.920
you go right ahead,

03:39.953 --> 03:42.490
and you tell him
you're gonna be stepping down.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.631
I'm confused.

03:50.664 --> 03:51.899
Admit what?

03:53.534 --> 03:56.604
Okay. Okay.

03:56.637 --> 03:58.539
So here's what's
gonna happen now.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.275
I'm call some labs, I'm gonna
get the samples tested,

04:01.309 --> 04:03.777
and when those
results come back,

04:03.811 --> 04:05.779
I'm gonna share that with Don.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.648
And the state's
attorney's office.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.517
And pretty much anybody else
who will listen.

04:09.550 --> 04:11.652
At which point, Matt,

04:11.685 --> 04:13.754
you're gonna be going to jail.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.489
So you have a nice day.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.068
Ms. Grimes?

04:28.101 --> 04:29.637
Sheriff, nice seeing you.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.972
Hold up.

04:32.005 --> 04:34.808
You want to come into my office,
tell me where you been?

04:34.842 --> 04:36.710
I actually really need
to get to my hotel.

04:36.744 --> 04:39.647
I understand that, it's just,
you know, we have an active

04:39.680 --> 04:40.914
missing persons investigation.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.516
Well, I'm not missing
anymore, so...

04:42.550 --> 04:44.452
I can see that-- doesn't mean
we just close the books.

04:44.485 --> 04:45.819
I'm need to ask you
some questions.

04:45.853 --> 04:47.488
Sheriff, as I'm sure
you can tell

04:47.521 --> 04:49.323
using your lawman's powers
of investigation,

04:49.357 --> 04:51.024
I'm in fairly desperate
need of a shower.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.760
You go for a walk in the woods?

04:52.793 --> 04:55.329
Yeah, I did. I went for a walk.

04:55.363 --> 04:56.697
Uh-huh. Alone?

04:56.730 --> 04:59.933
Yes. I got lost,
and I found my way back.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.835
Not a terribly gripping story,
but there you have it.

05:01.869 --> 05:03.537
The urge to walk
must've been pretty strong

05:03.571 --> 05:04.972
considering you left
your car unlocked,

05:05.005 --> 05:06.674
your purse inside, you know.

05:06.707 --> 05:08.576
-We have that here.
-I need to get that from you.

05:08.609 --> 05:11.011
You can have it
when you talk to me.

05:11.044 --> 05:13.013
What's in your jars?

05:13.046 --> 05:15.383
Nothing. Souvenirs.

05:15.416 --> 05:16.884
-From my walk.
-Can I see?

05:16.917 --> 05:18.686
Sheriff, I really need
to get to my hotel.

05:18.719 --> 05:21.088
And I'm gonna take a shower,
and at some point very soon,

05:21.121 --> 05:23.824
I promise, I'm gonna come back
here and we will have a chat,

05:23.857 --> 05:25.493
and I will gather
my personal belongings.

05:25.526 --> 05:26.994
I want you back here
before 12:00 noon.

05:27.027 --> 05:28.496
Oh, I can't wait.

05:28.529 --> 05:29.463
Haylie.

05:33.634 --> 05:34.968
You okay?

05:36.804 --> 05:39.807
I've actually never
felt better in my life.

05:45.546 --> 05:46.980
SHURN:
Water's running frightful low.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.783
That group back from
Shady Pond yet?

05:49.817 --> 05:51.118
First thing daybreak,

05:51.151 --> 05:53.787
but what they brung
already been sopped up.

05:53.821 --> 05:56.390
KRAKE: Cistern's spitting
more air than water, Bren'in.

05:56.424 --> 05:57.591
What we gonna do?

05:57.625 --> 05:58.992
"What are we gonna do?"

05:59.026 --> 06:00.528
Like she even knows.

06:00.561 --> 06:01.829
WOMAN:
That's it.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.096
She's gone dry.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.865
-(all clamoring)
-What you talking about?

06:04.898 --> 06:06.700
-Water's gone.
-How much did you take?

06:06.734 --> 06:08.602
-I took enough for me and my
family. -You and your family?

06:08.636 --> 06:09.870
They all got families!

06:09.903 --> 06:10.838
We're all trying
to survive up here...

06:10.871 --> 06:12.440
I got my childr...

06:12.473 --> 06:14.608
...and you're taking more
than everybody else!

06:14.642 --> 06:16.577
(clamoring continues)

06:16.610 --> 06:17.811
We all need this water!

06:17.845 --> 06:19.079
(shouting)

06:19.112 --> 06:21.749
They all need water!
We all need it!

06:21.782 --> 06:24.518
(clamoring continues)

06:30.558 --> 06:33.126
MEYERS: No, of course you don't,
because you weren't here.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.095
No, that-- but I'm not
questioning that, okay?

06:36.897 --> 06:38.065
No, you...

06:38.098 --> 06:40.200
Right, it's...

06:40.233 --> 06:42.770
Yeah, uh, I got to go, Don.

06:42.803 --> 06:44.004
Okay.

06:48.208 --> 06:50.778
-Yeah? -Hey, can I talk
to you for a minute?

06:50.811 --> 06:52.179
I mean, I know you're busy.

06:52.212 --> 06:53.581
Yeah, sure.

06:53.614 --> 06:54.748
-Okay.
-Yeah.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.953
I just, uh, I was just
talking to Haylie Grimes.

06:59.987 --> 07:01.822
Yeah, she's back.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.524
Is that-- what a relief.

07:03.557 --> 07:05.859
Well, I'm surprised
to hear you say that,

07:05.893 --> 07:07.861
considering she, you know,
she was just in here

07:07.895 --> 07:09.630
sort of tearing you
a new one, right?

07:09.663 --> 07:11.865
-Yeah, what was that about?
-I... I wish I knew.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.701
I mean, I'm-I'm actually
worried about her, Sheriff.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.769
I mean, I don't know if
it's the pressure of the job

07:15.803 --> 07:18.606
-or her failure...
-She seemed pretty normal to me.

07:18.639 --> 07:20.474
You know, just--
she seemed fine, you know.

07:20.508 --> 07:23.076
-Pretty-pretty pissy and bossy,
you know? -(chuckles)

07:23.110 --> 07:24.878
-Yeah.
-Yeah, yeah.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.847
Where-- did she say
where she went?

07:26.880 --> 07:28.682
-No.
-No. You ask her?

07:28.716 --> 07:30.250
Of course I did.

07:30.283 --> 07:34.087
What-- she say what was in those
two little jars she had?

07:34.121 --> 07:35.489
I don't know. Alcohol?

07:35.523 --> 07:36.690
I mean, that would
explain a lot.

07:36.724 --> 07:38.859
I just got a call in
to Don Foushee.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.728
-And, like, hopefully we can get
her some help. -Don Foushee?

07:40.761 --> 07:42.630
Yeah, I mean,
and I'm serious, Sheriff.

07:42.663 --> 07:44.732
I-I think she can
do harm to herself.

07:44.765 --> 07:47.935
You know, why she come barging
in here so urgent, you know?

07:47.968 --> 07:49.803
-Know why that was?
-Who the hell knows?

07:49.837 --> 07:53.173
She was raving, and...
none of it made sense.

07:53.206 --> 07:54.942
I-I just...

07:54.975 --> 07:57.277
I mean, did she say
anything to you

07:57.310 --> 08:00.047
about-about what she said to me?

08:00.080 --> 08:01.749
No.

08:01.782 --> 08:03.283
-I'll should ask her.
I'll ask her. -Yeah.

08:03.316 --> 08:05.653
Next time I talk to her,
I'll ask her.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.721
-You know, what she was
talking about. Yeah. -Yeah.

08:07.755 --> 08:10.123
-I'll let you get to it.
-Thank you.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.094
You hungry?
You want something to eat?

08:14.127 --> 08:15.062
No, I'm good, thank you.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.164
-Something to drink, a coffee?
-No, thanks.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.608
G'WIN:
I don't understand.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.610
Grain store was near
half-full not two days ago.

08:29.643 --> 08:32.880
Suppose they're taking more than
they need and hiding it away,

08:32.913 --> 08:35.649
for fear of bleak times to come.

08:35.683 --> 08:38.786
War spreads like a fever.

08:38.819 --> 08:42.189
First the folks
below against us.

08:42.222 --> 08:45.859
Now us against our own kin.

08:45.893 --> 08:48.061
(sighs)

08:48.095 --> 08:49.730
I do have an idea.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.699
One that could solve
both our problems

08:51.732 --> 08:53.166
all at the same time.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.102
Pray tell.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.770
I'm sorry, Bren'in, maybe
I'm not comprehending proper

08:56.804 --> 08:58.572
-what you just said.
-All respect,

08:58.606 --> 09:00.708
but I'm thinking
some of your husband's crazy

09:00.741 --> 09:02.710
-done rubbed off on you.
-Whoa, hey, watch yourself.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.044
G'WIN:
We're going on this run.

09:04.077 --> 09:06.013
They poisoned our water
and they ruined our crops.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.748
We're only gonna take back
what's owed us.

09:07.781 --> 09:09.182
Water and flour, that's all.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.351
Now, what we take,
it's important,

09:11.384 --> 09:13.020
but what we leave behind,

09:13.053 --> 09:14.688
that could be
even more important.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.256
What's that?

09:16.289 --> 09:17.691
Our story.

09:17.725 --> 09:19.226
You think any of them
folks down there

09:19.259 --> 09:21.161
will actually care to hear it?

09:21.194 --> 09:23.130
It's not just hearing,
Krake, it's seeing.

09:23.163 --> 09:24.732
See, like that coal woman,

09:24.765 --> 09:26.734
most of those folks down there,
they got phones,

09:26.767 --> 09:28.201
and those phones take pictures.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.803
Now, if they show those pictures
to people they know,

09:29.837 --> 09:31.171
and those people do the same,

09:31.204 --> 09:32.906
well, soon, our struggle's
gonna be known

09:32.940 --> 09:34.742
-far, wide and strong.
-BIG FOSTER: No, our trouble's

09:34.775 --> 09:37.277
-gonna be getting back up alive,
you ask me. -That's right.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.279
We're gonna walk into a nest
of hornets down there.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.782
And the law will have
no end of fire.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.250
And them guards at the fence,
they ain't gonna

09:43.283 --> 09:44.985
just let us stroll on down.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.888
Now, you ain't gonna agree,
but we need to be armed.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.222
Oh, I do agree.

09:49.256 --> 09:51.291
But a weapon shown

09:51.324 --> 09:52.926
is much more effective
than a weapon used.

09:52.960 --> 09:55.028
-That's right.
-So if there is gunfire,

09:55.062 --> 09:57.264
it ain't gonna be
our side firing first.

09:57.297 --> 09:59.366
-Oh, I understand. -And you
make sure that all our people,

09:59.399 --> 10:00.901
they understand the same.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.670
'Cause we are trying
to tell our story here,

10:02.703 --> 10:04.738
and one bullet
could undo the whole thing.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.373
-That's right.
-WILLEM: Fire or no,

10:06.406 --> 10:07.975
we show ourselves down there

10:08.008 --> 10:09.877
and the police are
gonna be on us thick.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.312
Not if they're distracted.

10:12.345 --> 10:14.314
By what?

10:14.347 --> 10:15.949
By me.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.898
(Hasil sighs)

10:30.931 --> 10:32.700
What?

10:32.733 --> 10:33.967
We need to talk.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.839
Just-just give me a minute.

10:38.872 --> 10:39.907
(both chuckle)

10:39.940 --> 10:41.074
Get out of here.

10:41.108 --> 10:44.945
Fight last night wore me out.

10:44.978 --> 10:47.347
That's what we need
to talk about.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.950
I was the counting the money

10:49.983 --> 10:51.919
from the fight last night,
and something ain't right.

10:53.186 --> 10:55.022
How do you mean?

10:55.055 --> 10:58.358
How much you make from your
last fight, two nights ago?

10:58.391 --> 11:01.128
About... oh...

11:01.161 --> 11:03.063
hair over $1,000.

11:05.465 --> 11:07.034
If I recall correctly.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.169
Mm-hmm.

11:09.202 --> 11:11.939
Fight from last night,
you made less than $700.

11:11.972 --> 11:15.843
So somebody's keeping some
on the side, but it ain't you.

11:15.876 --> 11:17.945
(clicks tongue)
Who do you think?

11:25.218 --> 11:26.987
Look, you two
got to be careful here.

11:27.020 --> 11:28.756
Real careful.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.724
'Cause this is starting to sound
like an accusation.

11:30.758 --> 11:33.193
Oh, it's not starting to sound
like an accusation, Butch.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.328
It is one.
You've been shorting us.

11:35.362 --> 11:37.230
Definitely these
last couple of fights,

11:37.264 --> 11:39.066
-and maybe even longer than
that. -Where's this coming from?

11:39.099 --> 11:40.768
Is this both of y'all

11:40.801 --> 11:43.503
-or just her? -Ugh,
just be honest with us, Butch.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.405
Can you believe this?

11:45.438 --> 11:48.108
Don't look at me.

11:48.141 --> 11:52.012
Look, he's getting less money
for a very simple reason.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.814
SALLY-ANN:
Yeah? What's that?

11:55.048 --> 11:56.850
We had to hire

11:56.884 --> 11:58.786
-more of them lookouts,
remember? -Mm-hmm.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.220
SALLY-ANN:
How much you paying them?

12:00.253 --> 12:01.855
$40 each.

12:01.889 --> 12:04.157
Mm-hmm. Still doesn't explain
the discrepancy.

12:04.191 --> 12:06.493
Well, there's the food.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.896
Remember that time I got food?

12:08.929 --> 12:10.130
Talking about? What food?

12:10.163 --> 12:11.364
The donuts!

12:11.398 --> 12:13.901
You bought four
and then you ate three of them.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.235
(sighs)

12:17.270 --> 12:19.873
All right, look.

12:19.907 --> 12:24.411
I admit, the split hasn't been
proper the last couple fights.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.246
I'm sorry.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.048
We really need the extra money.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.382
I mean, Frida
with her transition,

12:29.416 --> 12:33.353
and the hormones and everything.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.789
My girl's got a dream.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.557
I just want
to make it real for her.

12:37.590 --> 12:41.061
Good Lord,
even I call bullshit on that.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.863
Just give them
what you owe them.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.197
Goddamn man-child.

12:44.231 --> 12:46.934
All right, fine.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.071
I don't know what it should be,
but it's probably...

12:51.104 --> 12:53.006
Oh, no, no, no.
I'll figure it out.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.408
And I'll bring back
what you're owed, if anything.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.177
But from now on,
we're done, Butch.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.312
I'm representing Hasil now.

12:59.346 --> 13:02.315
And he's gonna get every bit
of what he's owed.

13:02.349 --> 13:04.584
Come on, baby.

13:04.617 --> 13:06.353
H-Hey, now.
Wait a minute. Just hold up...

13:09.622 --> 13:12.092
Shut your mouth, Butch.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.964
You know, I thought
you were my friend.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.500
-I...
-Mm-mm.

13:23.170 --> 13:25.973
Ma'am.

13:26.006 --> 13:27.941
(door closes)

13:30.510 --> 13:32.445
Pathetic.

13:36.083 --> 13:39.252
Our water and our soil have been
poisoned by the coal company.

13:39.286 --> 13:41.254
One of our children has already
died because of...

13:41.288 --> 13:43.290
(knocking on door)

13:43.323 --> 13:45.525
-Come.
-(door opens)

13:46.994 --> 13:49.162
You called for me?

13:49.196 --> 13:52.232
You choose your men
for the run yet?

13:52.265 --> 13:53.333
All set.

13:53.366 --> 13:54.601
Is Lil Foster among them?

13:54.634 --> 13:57.037
Mm. Ain't no sign of him.

14:00.140 --> 14:03.043
Hmm. You want him keeping
an eye on me down there?

14:03.076 --> 14:04.144
Is that why you're asking?

14:04.177 --> 14:06.479
Or is that why you're going?

14:06.513 --> 14:08.548
-I'm going 'cause it's my duty.
-Oh, well,

14:08.581 --> 14:10.583
then to hell with your duty,
you ain't going.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.920
-I won't allow it.
-You won't allow it?

14:12.953 --> 14:16.089
-No. -Foster, you don't have
that kind of power over me.

14:16.123 --> 14:17.991
Well, I'm just trying
to protect you.

14:18.025 --> 14:19.059
I'm not gonna make
a dangerous plan

14:19.092 --> 14:20.493
and then send others to do it.

14:20.527 --> 14:22.162
I am trying to be
a right leader here, Foster.

14:22.195 --> 14:24.131
But what if something
happens to you?

14:24.164 --> 14:25.966
I ain't got no concerns
for myself.

14:25.999 --> 14:29.169
Oh? Well, what about that child
you're carrying?

14:29.202 --> 14:30.337
You got any concerns there?

14:30.370 --> 14:31.571
That's gonna be our child.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.206
No, I told you
that this child...

14:33.240 --> 14:35.475
Oh, I know, I know!

14:35.508 --> 14:38.645
I know it ain't mine!

14:38.678 --> 14:42.382
All right, I got it
burned in my skull just fine

14:42.415 --> 14:44.484
the first time you said it.

14:48.956 --> 14:52.225
I told you.

14:52.259 --> 14:55.695
I will be father to that baby.

14:55.728 --> 14:59.099
I'm gonna... I'm gonna give it
everything that I never got.

14:59.132 --> 15:01.634
I'm gonna get it everything
I couldn't give to my boys.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.503
I'll get it everything

15:03.536 --> 15:06.406
that you couldn't give to
your first child died a-borning.

15:08.308 --> 15:11.678
My baby is not a means for you
to right your past wrongs.

15:11.711 --> 15:15.515
This child, it will be good,
it will be pure,

15:15.548 --> 15:17.717
and I will not be expose it
to your darkness

15:17.750 --> 15:20.387
-and your anger.
-No. I got no darkness.

15:20.420 --> 15:23.490
You just showed it,
not two breaths ago!

15:23.523 --> 15:27.094
I will never forget the fear
that you planted in me.

15:27.127 --> 15:29.629
And I will not let that fear
touch an innocent creature

15:29.662 --> 15:31.331
that I bring into this world.

15:31.364 --> 15:34.267
I will never, I will never
let you near this child.

15:34.301 --> 15:35.502
Not ever.

15:39.672 --> 15:41.208
Go.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.214
Go!

15:53.586 --> 15:55.989
(door opens)

15:56.023 --> 15:57.524
(door closes)

15:57.557 --> 15:58.691
(knocks)

15:58.725 --> 16:00.027
(sighs)

16:03.063 --> 16:04.697
-Hi.
-Hi.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.566
This is a nice surprise.

16:06.599 --> 16:09.736
Yeah. Just thought I'd come by,
say hello.

16:09.769 --> 16:12.205
I don't want to disturb your
dad, though. How's he doing?

16:12.239 --> 16:13.340
Oh, he's, um...

16:15.342 --> 16:17.310
He went to hospital last night.
He has pneumonia. So...

16:17.344 --> 16:19.779
-Oh, no. He's all right?
-He's gonna be there

16:19.812 --> 16:21.781
-for a couple days at least.
-Okay.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.317
-Yeah. -Well, they'll take
good care of him there.

16:24.351 --> 16:26.519
Sorry to hear that.

16:26.553 --> 16:28.388
-You want to come in?
-No, I...

16:28.421 --> 16:31.691
I can't, I have to... I have to
keep working, but, um...

16:31.724 --> 16:35.295
I just wanted to stop by
and see if you're good.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.797
-Uh...
-Everything's good.

16:37.830 --> 16:41.301
That's good. Just 'cause, you
know, I haven't spoken to you

16:41.334 --> 16:44.704
since I saw you last, and, uh,
just asking if it was okay.

16:47.174 --> 16:50.143
Are you, are you really
asking me that? (chuckles)

16:50.177 --> 16:52.379
I'm-- no, I mean, like,
I haven't done this in a while,

16:52.412 --> 16:55.648
so I just, I don't know if
people do it d-differently now.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.117
You mean, like,
different techniques?

16:57.150 --> 16:58.185
Yeah.

16:58.218 --> 16:59.752
No. What do you...?

16:59.786 --> 17:01.454
I'm not talking about that.

17:01.488 --> 17:03.523
(laughs):
Wade, stop.

17:03.556 --> 17:06.093
Oh. Yeah, okay.

17:06.126 --> 17:07.460
Hey.

17:09.129 --> 17:10.830
It was really lovely.

17:10.863 --> 17:13.333
Oh. Well, I'm glad.

17:13.366 --> 17:14.834
I'm not sure that lovely

17:14.867 --> 17:18.171
is what I was going for,
precisely, but, uh...

17:18.205 --> 17:20.740
Well...

17:20.773 --> 17:22.609
-why don't you come in?
-Oh, no.

17:22.642 --> 17:25.112
I mean, I have to go back
and keep working. Yeah.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.846
But, Sheriff,

17:26.879 --> 17:30.483
I'm in this big old house
all by myself and I'm afraid.

17:30.517 --> 17:32.852
There's some really big noises
in my bedroom.

17:32.885 --> 17:36.156
Do you think you could maybe
come look at it for me?

17:37.757 --> 17:39.259
Like official
sheriff's business?

17:39.292 --> 17:42.129
Yeah.
Official sheriff's business.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.496
It won't take a moment.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.132
Okay. (chuckles)

17:45.165 --> 17:46.499
(giggles)

17:49.336 --> 17:52.372
LIL FOSTER:
Can't be Asa's.

17:52.405 --> 17:54.441
Or Fa's.

17:54.474 --> 17:56.343
I figured on the days, G'Win.

17:58.145 --> 17:59.779
Glad all that drinking
and screwing

17:59.812 --> 18:01.581
hasn't crippled
your ability to count.

18:01.614 --> 18:04.251
Look, I'm sorry.

18:04.284 --> 18:06.453
For what?

18:06.486 --> 18:09.622
This child's in my belly,
not yours.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.624
I got a clan to save.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.593
Listen, I heard tell
of this run,

18:13.626 --> 18:15.395
this story that you think
you're gonna pass off

18:15.428 --> 18:18.431
onto these people down there;
it will not work.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.367
They're not like us.

18:20.400 --> 18:23.536
That world is black
as poison-- I know.

18:23.570 --> 18:27.174
I went through fire
in their prison box, G'Win.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.744
Well, we've all
been through fire, Foster.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.914
All of us. We've all been burnt
up and scarred and twisted,

18:34.947 --> 18:37.284
so stop feeling
so damn original.

18:38.851 --> 18:41.321
And tomorrow, I'm going down
this mountain,

18:41.354 --> 18:42.889
surrounded by my family.

18:42.922 --> 18:46.626
Men, women, even children.

18:46.659 --> 18:49.362
But where are you gonna be? Hmm?

18:59.506 --> 19:01.374
(door opens)

19:18.391 --> 19:18.925
*

19:18.958 --> 19:19.626
Well, this ain't good.

19:21.594 --> 19:26.333
Mm. He's passed out drunk,
is what he is.

19:26.366 --> 19:28.401
Looks that way, don't it?

19:31.271 --> 19:32.805
What you want?

19:32.839 --> 19:36.676
This not shooting first thing--
it don't make sense.

19:36.709 --> 19:38.678
I mean, if we ain't
shooting first...

19:38.711 --> 19:40.647
BARNABIS:
That means somebody else is.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.615
And that somebody's bound
to be one of them

19:42.649 --> 19:44.417
shooting at one of us.

19:44.451 --> 19:46.853
And we just ain't comfortable
with that arrangement.

19:46.886 --> 19:49.222
It's... Don't want to go against
what the Bren'in said...

19:49.256 --> 19:51.324
Oh, heavens, no.

19:51.358 --> 19:54.227
Oh, no. Don't want to do that.

19:54.261 --> 19:55.862
No, can't do that, no!

19:55.895 --> 19:58.698
'Cause the Bren'in...

19:58.731 --> 20:01.368
she only gets what she wants.

20:04.437 --> 20:07.006
If anybody down there

20:07.039 --> 20:10.543
raises a weapon on you tomorrow,

20:10.577 --> 20:12.979
you shoot, all right?

20:14.447 --> 20:17.284
You shoot first, second.

20:17.317 --> 20:20.320
You shoot third. All right?

20:20.353 --> 20:25.558
And you keep on shooting
until they are cold dead.

20:25.592 --> 20:28.761
'Cause we ain't dying
down there tomorrow,

20:28.795 --> 20:30.830
and because that is what I want.

20:30.863 --> 20:32.532
All right.

20:36.969 --> 20:39.639
Well, there you are.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.641
Mm...

20:41.674 --> 20:43.610
Not right now.

20:43.643 --> 20:46.379
Somebody needs
some Farrell wine.

20:46.413 --> 20:47.880
I'll go fetch us some.

20:47.914 --> 20:50.750
Look.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.752
I can't do this no more.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.887
What you mean?

20:56.656 --> 20:57.924
I'm staying.

20:57.957 --> 21:00.727
For the baby, or for her?

21:02.629 --> 21:05.031
I don't know.

21:05.064 --> 21:07.734
Oh, w-what about that house

21:07.767 --> 21:10.403
you were gonna build
up on the cliffs?

21:10.437 --> 21:14.474
I thought that might be
for you and me, maybe.

21:17.544 --> 21:19.412
Come here.

21:19.446 --> 21:20.847
Come on.

21:24.417 --> 21:26.353
I thought you loved me.

21:28.421 --> 21:31.023
You're glorious.

21:31.057 --> 21:34.494
You're glorious, you truly are.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.696
I was a drowning man.

21:36.729 --> 21:38.598
You gave me my breath back.

21:38.631 --> 21:40.333
I still can.

21:42.402 --> 21:45.037
Just so long as you can...

21:45.071 --> 21:47.640
move on from her.

21:52.879 --> 21:54.080
(exhales)

22:08.428 --> 22:09.796
Oh, no. No need to apologize.

22:09.829 --> 22:12.399
I love being put on hold
for eternity.

22:12.432 --> 22:13.900
Yeah, I thought
you were gonna say that.

22:13.933 --> 22:15.735
Could you explain to me, sir,

22:15.768 --> 22:17.537
how it's possible
that all six-- no, I'm sorry--

22:17.570 --> 22:19.606
seven labs
in a hundred-mile radius

22:19.639 --> 22:20.907
are suddenly unable to take on

22:20.940 --> 22:22.509
even one small piece
of business?

22:22.542 --> 22:24.744
-(knocking on door)
-Hold on!

22:24.777 --> 22:27.013
Where is all this work
suddenly coming from?

22:28.881 --> 22:30.750
That's because there isn't
any work, is there?

22:30.783 --> 22:33.686
Did somebody call you and tell
you that I was gonna be calling?

22:33.720 --> 22:35.688
What, did they pay you off?

22:35.722 --> 22:37.757
Hello? Hello?

22:37.790 --> 22:38.825
(knock on door)

22:38.858 --> 22:40.993
I'm coming!

22:44.163 --> 22:46.098
Well, speak of the devil.

22:46.132 --> 22:48.501
-I need to talk to you.
-Yeah, go away.

22:48.535 --> 22:50.503
-No. -Matt, do you want me
to call security?

22:50.537 --> 22:51.671
Just give me
two seconds, please.

22:51.704 --> 22:53.440
Get out of here right now.

22:53.473 --> 22:54.707
I'm worried about you, okay?

22:54.741 --> 22:56.843
That's the only reason I'm here.

22:56.876 --> 23:00.046
I think you need to take
a breather and regroup.

23:00.079 --> 23:02.148
This is the lady who books
all my personal travel.

23:02.181 --> 23:04.584
I already called her
and told her you'd be in touch.

23:04.617 --> 23:05.852
What are you talking about?

23:05.885 --> 23:07.987
Take a vacation--

23:08.020 --> 23:10.623
a week, two weeks, wherever
you want, within reason.

23:10.657 --> 23:12.925
You can even take your son
along if you want.

23:12.959 --> 23:14.794
My gift to you.

23:14.827 --> 23:18.097
Wow. You're even more scared
than I thought.

23:18.130 --> 23:20.132
You need to get out of here
right now.

23:20.166 --> 23:23.135
Listen. Whatever you think
is going on,

23:23.169 --> 23:25.472
whatever you think I did,
you're wrong.

23:28.641 --> 23:31.678
Those samples, they're only
gonna prove you wrong

23:31.711 --> 23:33.546
and make you look foolish.

23:33.580 --> 23:35.047
Get out, Matt.

23:36.783 --> 23:39.619
Right now.

23:39.652 --> 23:41.187
I tried.

23:46.726 --> 23:48.661
*

24:09.949 --> 24:11.884
*

24:31.270 --> 24:34.106
So... this is real?

24:34.140 --> 24:35.174
Yeah, it's real.

24:35.207 --> 24:37.744
Butch is out.

24:37.777 --> 24:40.747
And I'm handling Hasil's stuff
from now on.

24:40.780 --> 24:42.248
I guess it's true what they say.

24:42.281 --> 24:46.152
Behind every great man
is a foxy little woman.

24:46.185 --> 24:49.155
Yeah, well, we're doing things
different from now on.

24:49.188 --> 24:51.190
No more chump fights.

24:51.223 --> 24:53.726
He gets a bigger take and
he gets a prefight guarantee.

24:53.760 --> 24:56.262
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, now,
hold on there, sweet thing.

24:56.295 --> 24:57.997
You want to manage his business,
that's just fine,

24:58.030 --> 24:59.666
but don't you come in here
trying to manage mine.

24:59.699 --> 25:02.669
Yeah, well, don't you
be disrespecting her.

25:02.702 --> 25:06.172
You lose her, you lose me.

25:06.205 --> 25:08.641
Where would you be then?

25:08.675 --> 25:10.009
Hasil's your biggest draw.

25:10.042 --> 25:12.779
Oh, why don't you
take a look around.

25:12.812 --> 25:14.947
Seems like I'm drawing
just fine tonight.

25:14.981 --> 25:16.315
Yeah, well,
they're probably here

25:16.348 --> 25:18.117
thinking they're gonna
get a Farrell fight.

25:18.150 --> 25:19.986
Without Hasil,
you don't have one.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.621
Now, see, I'm just gonna

25:21.654 --> 25:23.923
have to disagree with you
on that one.

25:23.956 --> 25:27.059
Why don't you go on in,
take a peek?

25:33.866 --> 25:37.003
(crowd cheering, shouting)

25:37.036 --> 25:38.871
Excuse me. Excuse me.

25:38.905 --> 25:41.273
Excuse me.

25:41.307 --> 25:43.242
(men grunting)

25:50.282 --> 25:52.985
-No, Hasil, come back.
-Hey!

25:53.019 --> 25:54.220
Hey!

25:57.824 --> 25:59.959
MAN:
Stop! Freeze! Ho!

25:59.992 --> 26:01.994
(crowd shouting)

26:03.896 --> 26:06.032
You ain't Farrell.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.233
Ah, you're a Farrell.

26:07.266 --> 26:09.335
Well, howdy there, cousin.

26:09.368 --> 26:12.705
-We ain't cousins.
-We're all cousins up here.

26:15.307 --> 26:16.308
Huh?

26:16.342 --> 26:17.910
(crowd cheers)

26:24.050 --> 26:26.886
Your hat. (laughs)

26:29.789 --> 26:31.991
Uh, hey, hey, Farrell.

26:32.024 --> 26:34.026
Cousins, gather close.

26:37.063 --> 26:42.001
Step away now if you must.
No one will take it as weakness.

26:42.034 --> 26:44.170
Any of you?

26:44.203 --> 26:46.372
-No. -No. -No.

26:49.942 --> 26:53.713
Good.

26:53.746 --> 26:55.748
I wish I could tell
you all certain

26:55.782 --> 26:57.750
what we'll be facing down there.

26:57.784 --> 26:59.385
I can't.

26:59.418 --> 27:02.655
But whatever awaits us,

27:02.689 --> 27:05.291
let us face it together,
side by side.

27:05.324 --> 27:08.861
-(crowd mutters agreement)
-Let that be our strength.

27:08.895 --> 27:11.063
And let us all stand here again
together tomorrow,

27:11.097 --> 27:14.100
-every single one of us
home safe. -Yeah. -Yes.

27:14.133 --> 27:18.337
-Ged-gedyah!
-ALL: Ged-gedyah!

27:18.370 --> 27:20.773
Let's go.

27:49.301 --> 27:51.237
*

28:14.827 --> 28:16.763
*

28:23.002 --> 28:25.171
(engine rumbles)

28:30.309 --> 28:32.278
(laughs)

28:32.311 --> 28:33.980
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

28:34.013 --> 28:35.948
(engine revving)

28:44.456 --> 28:46.125
You ready?!

28:46.158 --> 28:47.426
-Yeah! -Yeah! -Yeah!

28:47.459 --> 28:49.395
Ged-gedyah!

28:49.428 --> 28:51.097
ALL:
Ged-gedyah!

28:59.005 --> 29:01.207
(people shouting)

29:34.140 --> 29:36.075
*

29:49.421 --> 29:51.423
(dialing)

29:51.457 --> 29:55.127
(line ringing)

29:55.161 --> 29:57.263
DISPATCHER: 911.
What's your emergency?

29:57.296 --> 29:59.231
(cell phone ringing)

30:05.504 --> 30:09.075
Sheriff Houghton's phone.

30:09.108 --> 30:10.542
Yes.

30:10.576 --> 30:12.278
-Wade?
-HOUGHTON: Yeah?

30:12.311 --> 30:14.046
Wade, your phone kept ringing,

30:14.080 --> 30:15.181
so I answered it.

30:15.214 --> 30:16.248
Wha... here.

30:19.185 --> 30:22.254
Hello.

30:22.288 --> 30:23.322
What?

30:50.682 --> 30:52.618
*

31:06.232 --> 31:08.334
Good day to you all.

31:08.367 --> 31:11.904
We're Farrells.

31:11.938 --> 31:13.239
We're not here out of disrespect

31:13.272 --> 31:15.241
or-or to take part
in lawlessness.

31:15.274 --> 31:17.009
We're-We're here out of need.

31:17.043 --> 31:20.146
You see, our water and our soil,
they've been poisoned

31:20.179 --> 31:24.150
by the coal company.

31:24.183 --> 31:25.551
Two members of our family
have already perished

31:25.584 --> 31:27.086
because of this,

31:27.119 --> 31:29.421
-one of them was a small child.
-(crowd mutters)

31:29.455 --> 31:31.357
He was innocent.

31:31.390 --> 31:34.193
The coal company, they're trying
to starve us from our home,

31:34.226 --> 31:36.528
and we need your help
to stop them.

31:36.562 --> 31:37.964
(car horn honks)

31:37.997 --> 31:39.465
Get out of the damn road.

31:39.498 --> 31:43.135
-They're not hurting anybody.
-(crowd mutters)

31:43.169 --> 31:45.071
Turn around.

31:45.104 --> 31:48.040
That's right. We're-We're not
here to hurt anybody.

31:48.074 --> 31:49.608
-(crowd muttering)
-Okay? Just, please,

31:49.641 --> 31:51.343
just look upon us as we are.

31:51.377 --> 31:54.013
-(siren wailing)
-W-W-We're mothers.

31:54.046 --> 31:56.482
We're fathers.
We're-We're sons and daughters.

31:56.515 --> 31:58.517
-We're just like you. We hurt.
-(sirens approaching)

31:58.550 --> 32:00.686
We bleed, we love.

32:00.719 --> 32:03.722
And we need your help, please.

32:03.755 --> 32:05.457
If you don't get out
of the road, I'll help you

32:05.491 --> 32:07.059
by running your
hillbilly asses over!

32:07.093 --> 32:08.227
(crowd shouting)

32:08.260 --> 32:09.928
Shut your mouth.

32:18.404 --> 32:20.339
(crowd muttering)

32:25.144 --> 32:28.014
All units, stand down. Do not
engage until I get there.

32:28.047 --> 32:29.681
Stand down and do not engage.
That is an order.

32:47.066 --> 32:49.368
Hey! Hey!

32:51.337 --> 32:53.005
What the hell you doing?

32:53.039 --> 32:54.106
What are you doing?

32:54.140 --> 32:56.075
Y'all can't be down here.

32:56.108 --> 32:58.544
Law's still burned on us
stealing Lil Foster away.

32:58.577 --> 33:00.312
Don't you worry on it, cousin.

33:00.346 --> 33:02.048
Ain't your fight no more.

33:09.221 --> 33:11.157
(siren wailing)

33:17.529 --> 33:19.431
Hey, sheriff's department
coming through!

33:24.236 --> 33:27.106
-Hello.
-Hello again.

33:28.540 --> 33:29.575
What are you doing here?

33:29.608 --> 33:31.810
We're speaking our truth.

33:31.843 --> 33:34.413
Well, you do that
at your own peril.

33:34.446 --> 33:36.648
-You understand that?
-I do.

33:42.254 --> 33:44.090
Hey, you fellas
hold it right there.

33:44.123 --> 33:45.791
MAN: W-We don't mean
no trouble, sir.

33:45.824 --> 33:47.193
You get out of here or you're
gonna get some trouble.

33:47.226 --> 33:48.327
-All right?
-Just put the gun down.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.429
Back on up to your bi...

33:50.462 --> 33:51.597
You'd best let these men be,

33:51.630 --> 33:52.498
they ain't here
to cause trouble.

33:52.531 --> 33:53.632
Just taking what we're owed.

33:53.665 --> 33:55.334
Go on, fellas, get busy.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.103
-And you calm yourself,
all right? -Yes, sir.

33:57.136 --> 33:58.470
Be gone before you know it.

33:58.504 --> 34:00.472
Come on, fellas.
All right?

34:00.506 --> 34:02.774
(classical music playing)

34:11.783 --> 34:15.587
Everybody down
on the ground right now, down!

34:15.621 --> 34:17.123
-Don't move!
-Stay down!

34:17.156 --> 34:18.457
Down, down, down!

34:18.490 --> 34:20.359
-Y'all stay down!
Get down!

34:20.392 --> 34:22.761
Everybody stay calm
and you'll be safe.

34:22.794 --> 34:25.564
Go. Move, move, move.
Let's go, move!

34:47.653 --> 34:49.655
Hey, come over here.

34:49.688 --> 34:53.225
You take...
take care of 'em here.

34:53.259 --> 34:54.860
(indistinct chatter)

34:54.893 --> 34:56.862
MAN:
Nobody wants them here.

34:56.895 --> 34:58.664
Okay, listen,
you need to go home.

34:58.697 --> 35:00.799
All's we want is
to be heard.

35:00.832 --> 35:02.634
I understand that,
but, you know,

35:02.668 --> 35:04.303
this is the middle
of a public thoroughfare.

35:04.336 --> 35:06.172
-You can't be...
-Our water and our soil

35:06.205 --> 35:07.273
-have been poisoned.
-I understand that, but it's...

35:07.306 --> 35:10.409
Your water and your soil?

35:10.442 --> 35:11.477
They dropped poison
from the air above

35:11.510 --> 35:13.279
onto our fields
and our springs.

35:15.681 --> 35:17.249
Your soil and your water both?

35:19.218 --> 35:20.586
DISPATCHER (over radio):
Sheriff Houghton?

35:20.619 --> 35:22.421
Yeah. Yeah, Houghton.
Go ahead.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.356
10-65.
Armed robbery in progress.

35:24.390 --> 35:27.259
Multiple locations.
Three businesses.

35:27.293 --> 35:28.760
Correction, four businesses--

35:28.794 --> 35:31.430
Kroger, Kmart,
Food Town, Shopco.

35:31.463 --> 35:32.831
It's your people, isn't it?

35:34.466 --> 35:37.603
We got multiple 10-65s.

35:37.636 --> 35:38.904
We need to clear out
of here right now.

35:38.937 --> 35:40.472
Jim, you stay here,
take care of this.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.608
Jesus!
Goddamn it!

35:42.641 --> 35:44.543
(sirens blaring)

35:44.576 --> 35:48.580
Farrells,
our work here is done.

35:48.614 --> 35:51.283
Let's return home.

35:51.317 --> 35:53.419
Go, go.

35:57.723 --> 35:59.191
-Look what I found.
-What?

35:59.225 --> 36:00.459
Some of their fancy drinking.

36:00.492 --> 36:02.261
Fancy drinking?

36:02.294 --> 36:04.363
We're only taking water
and grain, you donkey.

36:04.396 --> 36:06.532
-Well, it's mostly water.
-It's mostly water?

36:06.565 --> 36:07.666
What is it? Let me see.

36:07.699 --> 36:09.701
Put your hands up, Farrells!

36:09.735 --> 36:12.871
Drop the weapon.
Drop it!

36:16.842 --> 36:19.411
Kick it over here.

36:19.445 --> 36:21.880
Hey... hey...

36:21.913 --> 36:24.583
we... we ain't gonna
hurt nobody.

36:24.616 --> 36:26.885
All right?
We just...

36:26.918 --> 36:28.420
we just looking to have
a good time, is all.

36:28.454 --> 36:30.356
Okay?

36:30.389 --> 36:32.558
Why don't you take you
a little pull, brother?

36:32.591 --> 36:34.293
Come on, now.
Put your hands up.

36:34.326 --> 36:35.461
All right, they're up.

36:44.403 --> 36:45.737
(siren blaring in distance)

36:45.771 --> 36:47.673
What's going on?

36:47.706 --> 36:49.808
There's more of 'em inside,
robbing the store.

36:49.841 --> 36:51.410
This is bullshit.

37:05.056 --> 37:06.758
BARNABIS:
One little nip.

37:06.792 --> 37:08.627
One little nip, come on.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.262
Huh?

37:10.296 --> 37:12.831
Don't be unfriendly,
all right?

37:12.864 --> 37:13.865
Behind you.

37:16.802 --> 37:18.470
(chuckling)

37:18.504 --> 37:20.406
-Yeah, yeah.
-You got the gun.

37:20.439 --> 37:21.840
-Didn't you, you dumbshit.
-Yeah, that's right.

37:21.873 --> 37:23.675
There's something wrong
with you, you know that?

37:23.709 --> 37:24.943
At lease I got something
for nothing.

37:24.976 --> 37:28.280
-What's in that bottle?
-(gunshots)

37:28.314 --> 37:30.849
Give up, assholes!
I got you.

37:30.882 --> 37:33.385
No more running wild
in my town, Farrells.

37:36.488 --> 37:37.656
-Too late, Sheriff.
-Where'd they head?

37:37.689 --> 37:40.326
Off toward Bishop Street.

37:40.359 --> 37:42.027
(siren blaring)

37:50.336 --> 37:52.037
(cries out)

37:53.505 --> 37:55.674
(gunshots)

38:00.078 --> 38:01.980
-(dry-clicking)
-Goddamn it.

38:02.013 --> 38:04.282
-You out?
-No, I'm out, I'm out.

38:06.117 --> 38:09.455
What's the matter, boys?
You out of ammo?

38:09.488 --> 38:10.889
BARON:
Yeah, I figured that'd happen

38:10.922 --> 38:12.924
sooner than later,
you dumbshits.

38:12.958 --> 38:15.927
Well, now I'm coming
for you.

38:15.961 --> 38:17.929
Well, you keep on coming.
Come on! -Come on!

38:17.963 --> 38:19.965
BARNABIS:
All right, now come on out
and get it.

38:19.998 --> 38:21.633
You make your move,
come on!

38:25.371 --> 38:27.473
What the hell?

38:27.506 --> 38:30.409
Wait a minute.
Wait, wait.

38:30.442 --> 38:32.110
Come on, come on,
come on. Shit.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.412
Goddamn!

38:53.599 --> 38:55.867
(siren approaching)

38:55.901 --> 38:59.471
Hey, take what you got.
Get your boys out of here.

38:59.505 --> 39:01.407
Come on, go.
Go, go, go, go!

39:01.440 --> 39:02.774
(sirens approaching)

39:21.960 --> 39:23.729
(siren wailing)

39:40.679 --> 39:42.781
(laughs)

39:53.058 --> 39:55.093
Put your goddamn hands
in front of you right now

39:55.126 --> 39:56.495
where I can see 'em!

39:56.528 --> 39:59.898
Do it!
Hands out in front of you!

39:59.931 --> 40:02.601
Breece Dobbs,
my brother-in-law.

40:02.634 --> 40:04.135
You're the one killed him.

40:04.169 --> 40:05.837
Stay down, I said.
You move one muscle,

40:05.871 --> 40:07.639
I'm gonna shoot you
in the head right now.

40:10.676 --> 40:14.079
You ain't taking me,
like you took my boy,

40:14.112 --> 40:16.515
to some jail.

40:16.548 --> 40:17.916
You want me?

40:19.250 --> 40:21.753
You going to take me dead.

40:28.226 --> 40:30.762
Foster Farrell VI,
you're under arrest

40:30.796 --> 40:32.097
for the murder of Breece Dobbs.

40:32.130 --> 40:33.765
You have the right
to remain silent.

40:33.799 --> 40:35.567
-Anything you say or do...
-You want to shoot me?

40:35.601 --> 40:36.802
-...in a court of law.
-Go ahead and shoot me.

40:36.835 --> 40:38.537
Go on, do it.
Do it, you shit coward!

40:38.570 --> 40:39.938
-You shit coward!
-You shit coward!

40:39.971 --> 40:43.008
You hide yourself up
on a goddamn mountain.

40:43.041 --> 40:44.976
That's a goddamn coward!

40:45.010 --> 40:46.678
(motorcycle approaching)

40:50.281 --> 40:53.018
Drop the gun, Wade.

40:53.051 --> 40:56.087
Yeah, I don't think
that's too likely right now.

40:56.121 --> 40:58.223
If you don't,
I'm surely gonna use mine.

40:58.256 --> 41:01.192
You know, I was the one
that helped you.

41:01.226 --> 41:02.994
I'm the one that set you free.

41:03.028 --> 41:04.262
That's why I ain't
shot you yet.

41:04.295 --> 41:07.065
This man's a goddamn murderer.

41:07.098 --> 41:10.536
Murdering pig coward snake
killed my brother-in-law.

41:10.569 --> 41:13.238
Come on, Fa.

41:13.271 --> 41:15.273
Leave it, let's go.

41:15.306 --> 41:16.842
Come on, old man.

41:16.875 --> 41:19.177
You move one inch,

41:19.210 --> 41:21.913
I'm gonna shoot you
in your goddamn face.

41:21.947 --> 41:23.549
Go ahead and do it.

41:23.582 --> 41:25.584
I've wanted him dead
my whole life.

41:27.018 --> 41:29.521
See? I'm sorry to say
he means it.

41:31.623 --> 41:34.025
Why don't you people
just stay up there?

41:34.059 --> 41:36.828
Just leave us in peace.
That's all people want.

41:36.862 --> 41:39.230
They just want peace.

41:39.264 --> 41:41.266
Want to wake up on the morning
and take their kids to school,

41:41.299 --> 41:43.535
go to work--
not have to find their kin

41:43.569 --> 41:46.504
dead, splayed out like a dog
in the middle of the road.

41:48.907 --> 41:50.642
When's this gonna end?

41:50.676 --> 41:53.812
When we get to live
the same way.

41:58.083 --> 41:59.918
I'm walking away now,
Sheriff.

41:59.951 --> 42:01.620
You turn your back on me,

42:01.653 --> 42:04.856
I'm gonna shoot you
in the back of your head.

42:04.890 --> 42:07.125
(gunshot)

42:18.670 --> 42:21.607
Goddamn coward!

42:28.213 --> 42:30.015
We're here out of need.

42:30.048 --> 42:32.317
You see, our water and our soil,
they've been poisoned.

42:32.350 --> 42:33.852
(sighs)

42:33.885 --> 42:36.855
-Hey.
-Hey.

42:36.888 --> 42:39.257
REPORTER (on TV):
...throughout the downtown area.

42:39.290 --> 42:43.629
As they charted their protest
through the streets...

42:43.662 --> 42:45.931
You must have had a day.

42:45.964 --> 42:47.666
Yeah.

42:51.069 --> 42:52.203
Would you turn that off?

43:02.013 --> 43:04.182
What is it?

43:04.215 --> 43:07.218
I saw him today.

43:07.252 --> 43:08.687
The man who killed Breece.

43:12.658 --> 43:16.762
I had my gun a half foot
from his chest.

43:18.029 --> 43:19.831
Could have shot him dead
right there.

43:19.865 --> 43:22.968
But you didn't.

43:23.001 --> 43:25.837
He's a Farrell.

43:25.871 --> 43:30.075
You know this thing,
this mess between us?

43:30.108 --> 43:32.043
It's not gonna get
any better.

43:32.077 --> 43:33.945
It's just gonna keep going

43:33.979 --> 43:37.649
and going and going.

43:37.683 --> 43:39.985
Maybe someone else can
do something about it,

43:40.018 --> 43:43.121
but, uh, not me.

43:43.154 --> 43:44.622
I'm not strong enough.

43:46.792 --> 43:48.727
-Yes, you are.
-No.

43:48.760 --> 43:52.330
Wade, you're strong enough
not to do the wrong thing

43:52.363 --> 43:55.300
when it's half a foot
in front of you.

43:55.333 --> 43:57.769
(phone ringing)

44:03.074 --> 44:05.410
Yeah?

44:10.982 --> 44:12.350
Yeah.

44:12.383 --> 44:15.220
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be
right there.

44:15.253 --> 44:18.056
Wade.
Wade, what is it, w...

44:18.089 --> 44:19.891
-Wade.
-(door shuts)

44:19.925 --> 44:21.659
(tires screech)

44:32.503 --> 44:34.706
(elevator bell dings)
