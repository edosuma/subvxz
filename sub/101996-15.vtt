28:02.305 --> 28:03.807
I CAN'T SAY, SIR.

28:03.848 --> 28:06.518
YOU'LL HAVE TO ASK HIM
WHEN HE WAKES.

28:06.559 --> 28:08.395
THE SNAKEBITE CASE

28:13.983 --> 28:15.694
TO SUBDUE THE USERS.

28:15.735 --> 28:17.362
WELL, MY CREW AND I
WERE SURROUNDED

28:17.404 --> 28:19.489
BY CANNIBALS HIGH
OUT OF THEIR MIND, SIR.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.449
WELL, YOU COULD HAVE USED
TEAR GAS, STUN GUNS.

28:21.491 --> 28:23.660
COME ON. THIS ORGANIZATION
HAS ITS OWN DAMN ARMORY.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.412
WELL, IF WE HAD
AN IA INVESTIGATION

28:25.453 --> 28:27.080
EVERY TIME A FIREARM
WAS DISCHARGED,

28:27.122 --> 28:28.623
WE'D NEVER MAKE IT
BACK INTO THE FIELD, SIR.

AT ALL YOUR CASES,

HOW MANY OF THESE INSTANCES
WOULD I FIND?

HOW MANY WOULD WE FIND

AT GOLIATHS STADIUM?

28:35.588 --> 28:37.048
THE CROWS HAVE NEVER
SHIED AWAY

28:37.090 --> 28:38.466
FROM USING
EXTREME FORCE.

28:38.508 --> 28:40.468
THAT IS NOT WHY I STARTED
THE CROWS.

28:40.510 --> 28:42.095
WELL, THAT'S WHO
WE ARE NOW.

28:42.137 --> 28:43.805
WELL, THEN MAYBE WE NEED
TO TAKE A LONG, HARD LOOK

28:43.847 --> 28:46.182
AT OURSELVES AND ASK
IF THE CROWS DESERVE
TO EXIST.

28:48.476 --> 28:50.645
IN THE MEANTIME,
I WANT YOUR BADGE,
I WANT YOUR GUN,

28:50.687 --> 28:52.063

RYAN: I'M HERE.
SOPHIE: OK, BATWOMAN.

29:19.883 --> 29:21.259
ACCORDING TO THE REPORT,

29:21.301 --> 29:23.386
TAVAROFF'S FOOTAGE
WILL BE IN STACK 815.

29:23.428 --> 29:25.138

ON YOUR RIGHT.

ABOUT BETTER BENEFITS.

29:35.565 --> 29:38.234
I MEAN, YOU BRAVELY PUT
YOURSELVES IN THE LINE OF FIRE,

29:38.276 --> 29:40.445
AND THAT'S YOUR PENSION?

29:40.487 --> 29:42.030
SERIOUSLY, I--

29:44.157 --> 29:46.075
THINK ABOUT YOUR LIFE,
THINK ABOUT YOUR CHOICES

29:46.117 --> 29:47.911
BECAUSE THE CROWS
HURT PEOPLE

29:47.952 --> 29:51.206

SO JUST ASK YOURSELVES

29:51.247 --> 29:53.416

-NOT YET.

TO 3 A.M.

30:28.451 --> 30:30.328
-OH, NO.
-TALK TO ME.

30:30.370 --> 30:32.872
THERE'S HUNDREDS
OF FILES IN
TAVAROFF'S FOLDER.

30:32.914 --> 30:34.707
IF IT'S BY DATE,
IT'D BE THE LAST ENTRY.

30:34.749 --> 30:36.876
THEY'RE NOT SAVED
BY DATE

30:36.918 --> 30:39.295
BECAUSE WHY WOULD
THE CROWS MAKE
SOMETHING EASY?

30:39.337 --> 30:42.298
CAN YOU GET LUKE'S
BEFORE IT'S DESTROYED?

30:42.340 --> 30:44.384
I CAN'T FIND
LUKE'S FOOTAGE.

30:48.721 --> 30:50.223
-OH, MY GOD.
-WHAT?

30:50.265 --> 30:52.725
TAVAROFF AND HIS MURDER
HAVE THE COMMANDER.

30:52.767 --> 30:54.936
HE'S NOT CONSCIOUS.
YOU NEED TO STOP THEM!

30:54.978 --> 30:57.313
I NEED TO SAVE LUKE
BEFORE THESE FILES
ARE ERASED!

30:57.355 --> 30:59.607
YOU DON'T KIDNAP
THE COMMANDER AND PLAN
TO LET HIM LIVE.

30:59.649 --> 31:01.776
THEY'RE GONNA KILL
JACOB KANE.

31:04.445 --> 31:06.489
FIGURE OUT
WHERE THEY TOOK HIM.

31:07.907 --> 31:09.492
SAW THE SNAKEBITE KITS
IN THE TRASH

31:09.534 --> 31:11.160
WHEN I WAS TYING
HIM UP.

31:14.289 --> 31:17.500

A FRICKING JUNKIE.

31:17.542 --> 31:21.671

31:23.756 --> 31:26.801
DUDE, 3?
THAT'LL KILL HIM.

31:26.843 --> 31:28.553
HE WAS GONNA TURN US
ALL IN.

31:28.595 --> 31:30.096
IT'S EITHER US OR HIM.

31:30.138 --> 31:31.848
DO YOU WANT TO GO
TO JAIL?

31:31.890 --> 31:34.392
HOW ABOUT YOU OR YOU?

31:37.604 --> 31:39.314
ALL IT TAKES
IS A HALF-WIT JUDGE

31:39.355 --> 31:43.234
AND A SOFT JURY,
AND WE'RE ALL DONE. FFFT.

31:43.276 --> 31:45.612
HUH?

31:45.653 --> 31:47.322
THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

31:47.363 --> 31:50.325

TO RUIN HIS LIFE.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.242

IT WAS THIS BAD.

33:15.910 --> 33:17.245

33:17.286 --> 33:18.997
I BEND THE RULES, TOO,

A CODE.

TO DO THE REST.

33:28.297 --> 33:30.842

AS THEM.

WAKING UP?

ANY SENSE.

34:01.956 --> 34:03.750

WAS THAT GUN.

WILLING TO TESTIFY

34:52.381 --> 34:54.092
TO THIS IN COURT.

34:54.133 --> 34:55.593

THE AGENTS INVOLVED

ARE BEING HELD

FOR ASSAULT
WITH THE INTENT TO KILL.

34:59.180 --> 35:02.767
I AM LUCKY THAT BATWOMAN
WAS THERE TO SAVE MY LIFE.

35:02.809 --> 35:05.144
WHAT DOES THIS SAY
ABOUT THE CROWS
AS AN ORGANIZATION

35:05.186 --> 35:08.481
AND YOU AS ITS LEADER?

35:08.523 --> 35:11.984
WELL, I STARTED THE CROWS
BECAUSE I WANTED TO

35:12.026 --> 35:14.278
PROTECT GOTHAM
FROM THE KIND OF MONSTERS

IS DIRECTLY RESPONSIBLE

35:27.291 --> 35:30.128
FOR WHAT HAPPENED
TO MR. FOX,

35:30.169 --> 35:33.840
I AM GUILTY OF HARBORING THESE
TYPES OF ACTIONS FOR YEARS.

35:33.881 --> 35:36.050
I WANT TO OFFER
A DIRECT APOLOGY

35:36.092 --> 35:37.385
TO THE FOX FAMILY
FOR ALL THE HURT

35:37.426 --> 35:38.928

35:38.970 --> 35:41.222
BUT THESE ARE NOT
ISOLATED MOMENTS,

35:41.264 --> 35:43.766
AND APOLOGIES MEAN NOTHING
WITHOUT ACTIONS.

35:43.808 --> 35:45.685
I HAVE THEREFORE COME
TO THE CONCLUSION

35:45.726 --> 35:49.063
THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY
TO MAKE AMENDS.

35:49.105 --> 35:51.149
AS THE FOUNDER
AND MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER,

35:51.190 --> 35:56.279
I HAVE DECIDED TO DISBAND
THE CROWS EFFECTIVE IMMEDIATELY.

35:56.320 --> 35:59.115

FOR THE SECURITY OF GOTHAM?

35:59.157 --> 36:01.492

NO BATTEAM WITHOUT YOU.

36:35.735 --> 36:39.113
EVERY TIME I THREATEN
TO REDECORATE THE BATCAVE...

36:41.490 --> 36:43.576
OR IGNORE
MY FASHION ADVICE,

36:43.618 --> 36:47.038
EVEN THOUGH CLEARLY
ONLY OWN A SUIT?

THAT YOU DESERVED IT

37:36.545 --> 37:38.339
JUST BECAUSE
YOU'RE BLACK.

37:45.721 --> 37:48.557
THEN WHAT'S THE POINT?

37:48.599 --> 37:51.477
IT'S NOT FOR ME
TO SAY,

37:51.519 --> 37:54.814
BUT YOU NEED
TO DECIDE...
