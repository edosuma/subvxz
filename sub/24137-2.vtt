00:58.633 --> 00:59.803
Hello, Lydia.

00:59.833 --> 01:02.773
You have got to be joking!

01:02.800 --> 01:05.300
(Sighs) I'm not going over
all that again.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.333
Good! Then pack up and leave.

01:07.367 --> 01:09.727
I have every right to be here.

01:09.767 --> 01:12.627
I have authorisation to be
a healthcare provider.

01:12.667 --> 01:15.127
And a permit for my pitch
in the market.

01:15.167 --> 01:16.727
You're not throwing me out
this time.

01:16.767 --> 01:18.697
Who did you have to bribe
to get those?

01:18.733 --> 01:21.733
- You're as cynical as ever.
- When it comes to you, yes.

01:21.767 --> 01:24.097
How on earth can you call this
a medical clinic?

01:24.133 --> 01:25.303
Come with me.

01:29.167 --> 01:30.327
This is Jeeta.

01:30.367 --> 01:33.067
He had terrible asthma until
he came to see me last year.

01:33.100 --> 01:35.730
And this is Vani.
How's your back now?

01:35.767 --> 01:37.427
Better.

01:38.567 --> 01:40.197
And this is Geeta.

01:40.233 --> 01:42.233
She had arthritis in both hands.

01:42.267 --> 01:45.297
How do you feel
after our treatments?

01:45.333 --> 01:47.333
Much better, thank you,
Dr Anila.

01:47.367 --> 01:50.397
Look, I'm sure there'll be some
type of placebo effect

01:50.433 --> 01:51.833
from whatever it is you give...

01:51.867 --> 01:55.127
Placebo, no. These are genuine
measurable improvements.

01:55.167 --> 01:57.227
Measured by whom? You?

01:57.267 --> 01:59.767
Last year, I was very sick.

01:59.800 --> 02:03.370
I had breathing problems,
fainting spells,

02:03.400 --> 02:05.800
I almost passed out.

02:05.833 --> 02:08.372
I went to see a doctor
and they did nothing.

02:08.400 --> 02:10.130
Nothing at all.

02:10.167 --> 02:13.267
Things got worse until I
couldn't even leave the house.

02:13.300 --> 02:17.270
Then Dr Anila came to see me and
in days I was back on my feet.

02:19.333 --> 02:22.503
Right. I don't suppose you
remember the name of this doctor

02:22.533 --> 02:24.103
who did "nothing at all",
do you?

02:24.133 --> 02:25.573
Oh, yes.

02:25.600 --> 02:27.530
It was you.

03:01.700 --> 03:04.270
Swollen ankle, query fracture.
What have you got?

03:04.300 --> 03:06.230
You don't want to know.

03:07.767 --> 03:09.197
I told you so.

03:10.833 --> 03:14.233
I changed the sheets in the male
ward and I swept the floor.

03:14.267 --> 03:16.527
What should I do after I've
taken them to the laundry?

03:16.567 --> 03:19.197
- Ambulance could use a wash.
- Way ahead of you.

03:19.233 --> 03:21.733
I washed and polished it
first thing this morning.

03:21.767 --> 03:23.397
You could go see Sister Patel,

03:23.433 --> 03:25.333
see if she needs
anyone taking to X-Ray.

03:25.367 --> 03:27.297
Yes, Sister. Thank you, Sister.

03:30.467 --> 03:32.597
How long do you think
you can keep up the act?

03:32.633 --> 03:35.503
Act? What act?

03:35.533 --> 03:38.173
A few more days.
My dad sees me enjoying my job,

03:38.200 --> 03:40.370
I'll be out of here
by the end of the week.

03:47.433 --> 03:49.203
11:45.

03:49.233 --> 03:51.473
That's the latest you have
come in on a day off.

03:51.500 --> 03:52.730
That's progress, Lydia.

03:52.767 --> 03:55.597
A former patient of mine,
I bumped into her today,

03:55.633 --> 03:57.633
is claiming that we...

03:57.667 --> 03:59.367
Oh, for Christ's sake.

03:59.400 --> 04:00.700
What?

04:02.767 --> 04:04.767
Reya Kohli, aged 28.

04:04.800 --> 04:07.330
Came in last January
complaining of nausea

04:07.367 --> 04:09.367
and intermittent syncope.

04:09.400 --> 04:12.500
She presented with symptoms of
a very serious heart condition.

04:12.533 --> 04:14.533
We were supposed to arrange
follow-up tests

04:14.567 --> 04:16.527
but somehow she slipped
through the system.

04:16.567 --> 04:18.027
How the hell did
that happen?

04:20.733 --> 04:22.333
That was a busy time,

04:22.367 --> 04:25.727
right after Dr Evans
but before Dr Walker.

04:25.767 --> 04:28.497
We were massively overstretched.

04:28.533 --> 04:30.833
Now she's under the care
of a herbal quack.

04:30.867 --> 04:32.767
Not our finest hour, I admit.

04:32.800 --> 04:35.170
Then I'll just have to
make her see sense.

04:42.133 --> 04:43.803
RUBY: Can you feel that? Yeah?

04:43.833 --> 04:45.373
This?

04:47.133 --> 04:50.173
(Winces) That. That's hurting.

04:50.200 --> 04:52.700
How did it happen?

04:52.733 --> 04:55.633
I'm a window cleaner. So I fell
off my ladder this morning.

04:55.667 --> 04:56.997
OK.

04:57.033 --> 05:00.403
Well, let's get you X-rayed and
we'll just take it from there.

05:00.433 --> 05:02.433
I don't want to be any bother.

05:02.467 --> 05:05.527
Give me something for the pain
and I'll get out of your way.

05:05.567 --> 05:08.067
We need to check if you've
broken anything first.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.730
OK?

05:09.767 --> 05:13.797
You're very kind, thank you. I'm
so sorry to be such a bother.

05:14.800 --> 05:16.470
That's OK.

05:26.533 --> 05:29.603
That seems OK.

05:29.633 --> 05:33.033
Now, we should check to see
if there's water on your lungs.

05:33.067 --> 05:35.067
- How are you feeling?
- Stupid.

05:35.100 --> 05:37.800
Don't feel bad, the ocean
currents can be deadly here.

05:37.833 --> 05:40.233
When the lifeguards brought him
back to the beach,

05:40.267 --> 05:43.297
I thought I'd lost him,
the silly sod.

05:43.333 --> 05:46.703
I'll try not to hold up your
holiday any more than I need to.

05:46.733 --> 05:49.203
We'll keep you here under
observation for a few hours,

05:49.233 --> 05:50.433
then you should be good to go.

05:50.467 --> 05:52.467
Is that... I mean...

05:52.500 --> 05:55.770
I don't want to tell you how to
do your job, but, are you sure?

05:55.800 --> 05:59.470
You hear stories, don't you,
of after effects, complications?

05:59.500 --> 06:01.100
What stories?

06:01.133 --> 06:05.173
I dunno, I mean...I nearly died.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.100
You're really shaken up,
aren't you?

06:07.133 --> 06:08.803
Don't worry.

06:08.833 --> 06:10.773
You are in good hands, OK?

06:16.167 --> 06:18.097
(Horns tooting)

06:27.500 --> 06:29.430
(Indistinct Tannoy announcement)

06:31.567 --> 06:33.197
Reya?

06:33.233 --> 06:35.603
Reya, there's something
I need to explain to you.

06:35.633 --> 06:36.803
Not now.

06:36.833 --> 06:40.203
The hospital made an admin
error, so no-one contacted you.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.733
But I've looked at
your notes again

06:41.767 --> 06:43.627
and I'd like you to come in
for some tests.

06:43.667 --> 06:44.827
I'm busy!

06:44.867 --> 06:47.497
Prolonged bouts of nausea
and fainting

06:47.533 --> 06:50.103
can be a sign of something
extremely serious.

06:50.133 --> 06:51.773
I'm perfectly fine.

06:51.800 --> 06:55.170
I assure you, herbal medicine
is not the answer.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.700
You need to see a real doctor.

06:56.733 --> 06:59.073
- I have a real doctor.
MAN: Reya?

06:59.100 --> 07:00.570
(He speaks Malayalam)

07:00.600 --> 07:02.600
(She replies in Malayalam)

07:02.633 --> 07:06.133
What happens if your symptoms
return when driving this bus?

07:06.167 --> 07:07.597
REYA: They won't.

07:07.633 --> 07:10.533
Reya, I can be an unbelievable
pain in the backside if I want.

07:10.567 --> 07:12.567
And I absolutely
will not let this drop.

07:12.600 --> 07:16.130
I'll be at the hospital, come in
when you've finished your shift.

07:16.167 --> 07:18.767
Otherwise I'll come here and say
the same thing tomorrow

07:18.800 --> 07:21.770
and the day after that and the
day after, as long as it takes.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.670
Then let me save you
wasting your time.

07:23.700 --> 07:25.230
The answer is no.

07:26.433 --> 07:28.373
Muthi, let's go.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.130
GREG: So what's the plan?

07:32.867 --> 07:34.597
No plan as such.

07:34.633 --> 07:37.003
Get some sun, relax,
get away from it all.

07:38.133 --> 07:39.573
Mainly the casseroles.

07:39.600 --> 07:40.800
Casseroles?

07:40.833 --> 07:43.673
When women of a certain age
find out a man's a widower,

07:43.700 --> 07:47.370
they come round bearing gifts,
namely casseroles.

07:47.400 --> 07:50.130
I've been fighting them off
in the driveway.

07:50.167 --> 07:52.227
What's funny about that?
I'm an eligible man.

07:52.267 --> 07:55.067
Oh, I know. I know, yeah.

07:55.100 --> 07:58.200
If I was ten years younger...

07:58.233 --> 08:00.173
Haven't you got customers
to serve?

08:03.267 --> 08:05.027
GREG: Yes, love,
what can I get you?

08:05.067 --> 08:06.797
Same again?
You all right over here?

08:06.833 --> 08:08.103
Lovely.

08:11.067 --> 08:12.497
What are you doing in here?

08:12.533 --> 08:14.533
Sorry, I was erm...

08:14.567 --> 08:16.397
looking for the toilet.

08:20.067 --> 08:21.997
I just needed some time
on my own.

08:23.067 --> 08:24.627
Are you all right?

08:24.667 --> 08:26.367
Not really, no.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.400
Is there anything I can do?

08:28.433 --> 08:30.303
I don't know.

08:30.333 --> 08:31.703
It's quite personal.

08:39.799 --> 08:41.030
Thank you.

08:41.067 --> 08:43.167
She's very good
at this kind of thing.

08:43.200 --> 08:45.200
- Aren't you?
- Yes.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.033
Apparently.

08:47.067 --> 08:48.597
It's Karen.

08:48.633 --> 08:50.633
I don't want to sound cruel,
but...

08:50.667 --> 08:52.597
I didn't realise
she'd be so full on.

08:54.133 --> 08:56.333
Full on?

08:56.367 --> 08:58.227
We've not been seeing
each other long.

08:58.267 --> 09:00.227
It's the first time we've been
away together.

09:00.267 --> 09:02.267
She's very demanding
when we're...

09:04.167 --> 09:05.427
..alone.

09:10.367 --> 09:13.327
If you like, I can tell her
that you need a rest.

09:13.367 --> 09:15.297
You need some time alone

09:15.333 --> 09:19.133
to recover from the trauma
you've been put through.

09:19.167 --> 09:21.097
- By the ocean.
- Yes.

09:22.867 --> 09:25.027
(Sighs) Yeah.

09:25.067 --> 09:26.727
That'd be brilliant.

09:29.133 --> 09:31.073
(Prayers and chanting)

09:35.800 --> 09:37.500
(Shutter clicks)

10:05.300 --> 10:07.300
(Chatter)

10:07.333 --> 10:10.103
RUBY: OK, your turn.
I need some help.

10:10.833 --> 10:12.473
What do you think?

10:12.500 --> 10:15.330
This is the window cleaner
that fell off his ladder.

10:15.367 --> 10:18.127
Am I missing something?
It seems perfectly normal to me.

10:18.167 --> 10:21.167
That's because it is. Why does
it take two of you to see that?

10:21.200 --> 10:23.100
- How was your day off?
- You're fired.

10:23.133 --> 10:24.433
Finally!

10:26.467 --> 10:28.397
You're not missing anything.

10:55.300 --> 10:56.630
Put it back.

10:56.667 --> 10:58.097
All of it.

11:01.100 --> 11:02.600
(She gasps)

11:08.667 --> 11:10.297
Open up! No!

11:13.067 --> 11:14.527
(Muffled) Let me out! Open up!

11:25.733 --> 11:27.603
- (Engine starts)
- No, no, no, no!

11:27.633 --> 11:29.573
Not my bike! (Groans)

11:33.700 --> 11:36.030
Is this a bad time
to mention bike locks?

11:39.867 --> 11:41.797
(Vendors shouting)

11:45.700 --> 11:47.630
Did you put her up to this?

11:47.667 --> 11:49.427
- Who?
- You know very well who.

11:49.467 --> 11:51.097
Reya won't even speak to me.

11:51.133 --> 11:53.303
What I say to my patients
remains confidential.

11:53.333 --> 11:55.833
If you genuinely care
about Reya's wellbeing,

11:55.867 --> 11:57.567
make her come back
to the hospital.

11:58.367 --> 11:59.767
Make her?

11:59.800 --> 12:01.730
Don't twist it,
you know what I mean.

12:01.767 --> 12:03.767
Help me to help her.

12:03.800 --> 12:06.630
Reya is my patient.

12:06.667 --> 12:09.397
Fine, then talk me through
how you're gonna test her

12:09.433 --> 12:12.373
for heart disease
without an ECG or an echo.

12:12.400 --> 12:15.570
There are ways of dealing with
underlying problems in the body.

12:15.600 --> 12:20.430
Oh, yes, the balance of
spiritual energy that supposedly

12:20.467 --> 12:22.497
affects everything
from diabetes to cancer.

12:22.533 --> 12:27.403
Come on, you were a medic! You
can't possibly believe in this.

12:27.433 --> 12:30.573
You know, I worked in a hospital
in Chennai for ten years.

12:30.600 --> 12:34.030
I've seen things that defy
conventional teaching.

12:34.067 --> 12:35.267
So have I.

12:35.300 --> 12:37.470
But freak occurrence
and coincidence

12:37.500 --> 12:40.100
doesn't mean
you have to believe in fairies.

12:40.133 --> 12:42.803
I believe in whatever works
for my patients.

12:42.833 --> 12:45.133
Not just the medicine
but the whole process.

12:45.167 --> 12:49.127
In the hospital, I would have to
see 30-40 patients a day.

12:49.167 --> 12:52.367
But here, I can give them time,
sit and actually talk to them.

12:52.400 --> 12:55.700
All of which sounds lovely
until you get a waiting room

12:55.733 --> 12:58.433
full of trauma victims
and infectious diseases.

13:00.067 --> 13:02.427
You know, if you'd given
more time to Reya

13:02.467 --> 13:05.327
perhaps she'd still be
your patient.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.367
Running a hospital
is a world apart

13:07.400 --> 13:10.130
from sitting in a tent
doing Reiki.

13:10.167 --> 13:12.667
This woman needs medical help,
not a cosy chat!

13:12.700 --> 13:14.700
I've seen doctors like you
before.

13:14.733 --> 13:17.373
You know, you love to be
a big fish in a small pond,

13:17.400 --> 13:18.830
everything under control.

13:18.867 --> 13:21.627
But with this one patient,
she's seen through you.

13:21.667 --> 13:24.327
There's no trust, no respect -
you mean nothing to her.

13:24.367 --> 13:27.227
And that must be killing you.

13:27.267 --> 13:29.267
I didn't realise you offered
psychobabble

13:29.300 --> 13:31.300
as well as magic potions.

13:34.433 --> 13:35.703
Excuse me.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.130
RAM: What did he take?

13:43.767 --> 13:45.367
Er...all sorts.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.330
Bandages, plasters, penicillin.

13:48.833 --> 13:50.803
Mainly morphine and syringes.

13:50.833 --> 13:53.173
It didn't occur to you
that he was a junkie?

13:53.200 --> 13:54.570
Obviously not.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.130
MARI: I called Carmel Hospital
in case he goes there.

13:57.167 --> 14:00.497
Someone matching his description
tried the same thing yesterday

14:00.533 --> 14:02.473
but they...

14:02.500 --> 14:05.600
Well, they realised straight
away and told him to leave.

14:10.300 --> 14:12.570
Glad to see
you've been coping without me.

14:30.667 --> 14:34.197
Erm...Dr Walker...

14:34.233 --> 14:38.433
..I was wondering if I could ask
you for a second opinion.

14:38.467 --> 14:40.467
(Karen laughs raucously)

14:40.500 --> 14:43.700
I need to tell Mr Taylor we'll
be discharging him tomorrow.

14:47.367 --> 14:49.127
I might give it a minute.

14:56.300 --> 14:58.330
- Lydia...
- Not now, Mari.

14:58.367 --> 15:00.297
You have a visitor.

15:09.067 --> 15:11.027
Reya, I'm so glad you came.

15:11.067 --> 15:13.167
If you come this way,
we'll get you started.

15:13.200 --> 15:16.330
That's not why I'm here.
After you came to see me,

15:16.367 --> 15:18.627
my supervisor called me
into his office.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.667
- I've been sacked.
- What?

15:20.700 --> 15:22.370
He heard what you said.

15:22.400 --> 15:24.570
I tried to tell him
that I'm fine now,

15:24.600 --> 15:27.430
that there's nothing wrong with
me, but he wouldn't listen.

15:27.467 --> 15:30.267
I'm on my own.
How do I look after him?

15:30.300 --> 15:31.400
Reya...

15:31.433 --> 15:33.433
I'll make a complaint
about you and your hospital.

15:33.467 --> 15:35.397
- Let me help you.
- Leave me alone.

15:43.833 --> 15:45.573
GREG: So, what you been up to?

15:45.600 --> 15:47.170
Sightseeing.

15:47.200 --> 15:50.330
Buddhist temple in the morning,
ashram in the afternoon.

15:50.367 --> 15:52.397
You went to a Buddhist temple
and an ashram?

15:52.433 --> 15:54.303
I've got a cultured side,
you know.

15:54.333 --> 15:56.803
Yeah, I've heard you get out
of the bath to do a wee.

15:56.833 --> 15:58.833
- I thought you came to relax.
- I did.

15:58.867 --> 16:00.427
Well, get yourself settled in.

16:00.467 --> 16:02.197
There's more where
that came from.

16:02.233 --> 16:04.703
I'm not stopping long. I've got
a busy day tomorrow.

16:04.733 --> 16:06.173
What are you up to?

16:06.200 --> 16:07.770
Going to a festival of
Kathakali theatre.

16:09.067 --> 16:12.027
Kathakali? Seriously?

16:12.067 --> 16:14.267
I mean, don't get me wrong,
some people love a bit

16:14.300 --> 16:17.230
of Hindu performance art, but I
can't see you being one of them.

16:17.267 --> 16:19.767
- You had a bang on the head?
- Get off, you daft bugger!

16:19.800 --> 16:22.100
I've had medical training of
sorts. Let's have a look.

16:22.133 --> 16:23.773
I said, get off!

16:43.133 --> 16:45.073
MALA: I'm back!

16:45.867 --> 16:48.027
What's all this?

16:48.067 --> 16:50.467
I just thought we'll have
a romantic dinner,

16:50.500 --> 16:52.130
just the two of us, you and me,

16:52.167 --> 16:54.327
and then see
where the evening leads us.

16:54.367 --> 16:56.267
That's a nice thought,
sweetheart,

16:56.300 --> 16:58.100
but tonight we are
with the Khattris.

16:58.133 --> 17:02.173
No, that's next week...isn't it?

17:02.200 --> 17:04.130
Do you ever use
the diary I got you?

17:05.200 --> 17:06.369
Yes, sometimes.

17:06.400 --> 17:07.829
Well, I can't cancel it now.

17:07.867 --> 17:10.327
- (Door opens)
- AJ?

17:10.367 --> 17:12.627
Be strong.
You're doing the right thing.

17:12.666 --> 17:14.567
It's fine, I'm going out now.
Have fun.

17:14.599 --> 17:17.130
There's a change of plans.
In fact,

17:17.166 --> 17:20.426
I'd like you to join us for
dinner with some few friends

17:20.467 --> 17:23.327
and...a nice young lady.

17:24.133 --> 17:25.703
God, not again.

17:25.733 --> 17:28.603
I know I've tried to match-make
for you before, but trust me,

17:28.633 --> 17:30.103
this time I'm right.

17:30.133 --> 17:32.373
- And this is fine for you?
- Absolutely.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.430
You have nothing else
planned tonight?

17:34.467 --> 17:37.197
Some things are more important.

17:37.233 --> 17:40.173
Of course, I can't make you come
with us, if you don't want to.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.470
No, you can't.

17:41.500 --> 17:45.500
I'll just sell your car and put
you on permanent night shifts.

17:50.767 --> 17:54.297
MAN: We were holidaying in
this posh five-star hotel,

17:54.333 --> 17:55.803
anything you could ask for.

17:55.833 --> 18:00.103
And guess what Mandeep
turned around and asked me.

18:00.133 --> 18:01.473
What did you ask, Mandeep?

18:03.067 --> 18:04.467
Is there a library?

18:06.233 --> 18:08.173
(Chuckling)
"Is there a library?"

18:10.367 --> 18:13.527
Well, I can't say AJ
is a voracious reader,

18:13.567 --> 18:16.227
but he certainly has some
interesting stories of his own.

18:17.767 --> 18:19.767
Yeah, I suppose.

18:19.800 --> 18:23.530
There's this really funny story
about this girl from England...

18:23.567 --> 18:25.797
Excellent! Excellent.
(Laughs nervously)

18:25.833 --> 18:29.333
But why don't you ask Mandeep
a little bit more about herself?

18:31.100 --> 18:33.100
Yeah, OK.

18:33.133 --> 18:36.433
Er...Mandeep...
do you have a favourite film?

18:37.367 --> 18:38.667
No.

18:40.067 --> 18:41.767
TV show?

18:41.800 --> 18:43.730
I don't watch TV.

18:47.433 --> 18:50.273
Erm...
OK, do you listen to music?

18:50.300 --> 18:51.700
No.

19:09.700 --> 19:12.200
WORKER: So the road is blocked
and the bus can't go.

19:12.233 --> 19:14.673
MANAGER: Why are you
telling me this?

19:14.700 --> 19:17.230
- The police have to come.
- That's your job.

19:17.267 --> 19:19.827
Go and get the road cleared,
that's what you're paid to do.

19:19.867 --> 19:22.397
Don't bother me, thank you.

19:22.433 --> 19:24.373
Thank you.

19:26.467 --> 19:30.567
Well, Reya hid medical
information from her employer.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.470
That's a very serious offence.

19:32.500 --> 19:35.330
She has a child, she was
desperate to keep her job.

19:35.367 --> 19:38.597
And I'm desperate to keep mine.
I can't let her drive a bus.

19:38.633 --> 19:41.033
Of course, but until we know
what's wrong with her,

19:41.067 --> 19:43.727
why not let her work in the
ticket office or as a conductor?

19:43.767 --> 19:47.097
I heard you talking, you said
she could be seriously ill.

19:47.133 --> 19:49.173
I'm running a business,
not a charity.

19:49.200 --> 19:51.230
Yes.
Yes, she could be seriously ill,

19:51.267 --> 19:53.497
but it doesn't mean
it isn't treatable.

19:53.533 --> 19:56.333
And if you give her
a second chance,

19:56.367 --> 20:01.067
I will do everything in my power
to keep her fit and healthy.

20:01.100 --> 20:04.370
Sir, I can't go because
I don't have a schedule.

20:04.400 --> 20:07.400
You don't have the schedule
because you left it here.

20:07.433 --> 20:09.373
Thank you, sir.

20:11.133 --> 20:13.133
And if nothing else,

20:13.167 --> 20:17.027
there's the time you'll save not
having to train someone else.

20:17.067 --> 20:19.397
Good staff aren't easy to find
these days.

20:19.433 --> 20:20.703
Tell me about it.

20:20.733 --> 20:24.173
And there's a hell of a lot of
paperwork when you fire someone.

20:24.200 --> 20:25.500
Must be very difficult.

20:25.533 --> 20:28.503
People don't appreciate how hard
it is to keep up with it all.

20:28.533 --> 20:31.503
Try running a hospital.

20:31.533 --> 20:35.273
If I say no to you, you will be,
what was your phrase -

20:35.300 --> 20:37.670
"an unbelievable pain
in the backside"?

20:37.700 --> 20:39.500
Afraid I will.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.030
Ah, all right?

20:46.067 --> 20:47.427
Hi.

20:47.467 --> 20:49.467
Mind if I tag along?

20:49.500 --> 20:52.700
Despite what I said last night,
I'm a huge fan of Kathakali.

20:52.733 --> 20:55.333
- Are you now?
- Oh, yeah, massive. Yeah.

20:55.367 --> 20:59.327
I'd love to play poker with you.
I'd make a bloody fortune.

20:59.367 --> 21:01.297
Kathakali theatre festival,
please.

21:22.333 --> 21:24.333
Two minutes of your time.

21:24.367 --> 21:27.097
OK, one minute! One minute.

21:27.133 --> 21:29.773
I've spoken to your boss,
he's agreed not to fire you.

21:29.800 --> 21:33.170
I have also spoken to
a specialist in Kochi.

21:33.200 --> 21:36.570
He works at a private clinic
but he will see you for free.

21:36.600 --> 21:40.530
Now, I know you don't trust me,
but he's an expert in his field

21:40.567 --> 21:43.697
and second opinions
don't come any better.

21:43.733 --> 21:47.003
I can tell you more, but it will
take longer than a minute.

21:51.633 --> 21:53.303
Thank you.

21:59.133 --> 22:02.103
I've got to give it to you,
Lydia, you're persistent.

22:04.200 --> 22:07.270
Here are some details about
the consultant, Mr Nagra.

22:07.300 --> 22:09.300
I've written my number
on the top,

22:09.333 --> 22:11.573
so you can ring me any time,
day or night,

22:11.600 --> 22:13.600
and I can arrange
an appointment.

22:13.633 --> 22:15.673
Your boss is expecting
to see you today

22:15.700 --> 22:17.700
to talk through some options.

22:17.733 --> 22:21.403
You won't be driving for now but
he'll keep you on the same pay.

22:21.433 --> 22:23.703
You spoke to him and he changed
his mind, like that?

22:23.733 --> 22:27.473
There is one condition - that
you agree to be under my care.

22:27.500 --> 22:29.330
Now she gets to it!

22:29.367 --> 22:31.197
You think the great
Lydia Fonseca

22:31.233 --> 22:33.773
can sweep and order people
around and they'll fall in line?

22:33.800 --> 22:35.830
She needs a clean bill of health
for insurance,

22:35.867 --> 22:37.727
not something you can provide.

22:37.767 --> 22:41.197
This woman is
an arrogant control freak

22:41.233 --> 22:44.073
who loves to tell you that only
she knows what's best!

22:44.100 --> 22:46.370
Reya, I appreciate
this is a difficult situation,

22:46.400 --> 22:48.700
but you have a very clear choice
about who to listen to.

22:48.733 --> 22:50.333
She has already made her choice!

22:50.367 --> 22:52.367
- Enough!
- (Baby cries)

22:52.400 --> 22:55.230
I'm not some stray dog
you can just fight about.

22:55.267 --> 22:57.267
Get out of my house.

22:57.300 --> 22:59.100
Both of you.

23:00.800 --> 23:02.300
Now!

23:02.333 --> 23:04.273
(Baby continues crying)

23:34.633 --> 23:36.703
RUBY: You've had a terrible
trauma, Mr Taylor.

23:36.733 --> 23:40.573
So remember,
plenty of rest and relaxation.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.600
Poor Gav,
he's gonna be so bored.

23:42.633 --> 23:44.473
GABRIEL:
Doesn't stop you having fun.

23:44.500 --> 23:47.270
Get outside in the sunshine,
keep up those Vitamin D levels

23:47.300 --> 23:48.800
or try relaxing on the beach.

23:48.833 --> 23:50.403
Or go on a day trip somewhere.

23:50.433 --> 23:53.633
Oh. Yeah, I just might do that.

23:53.667 --> 23:55.667
Right, come on, you. Come on.

23:55.700 --> 23:57.300
Oh, sorry.

24:01.533 --> 24:04.703
I don't know about you, but
that's why I got into medicine.

24:07.533 --> 24:09.533
I don't believe it. Hey!

24:09.567 --> 24:11.627
- Where's my bike?
- I can explain.

24:11.667 --> 24:14.227
- Where is my bike?
- The medicine is not working.

24:14.267 --> 24:16.497
If you're an addict, I can refer
you to a rehab clinic.

24:16.533 --> 24:18.273
It's nothing like that.

24:18.300 --> 24:21.370
You have to help me, we don't
have much time. Please.

24:28.267 --> 24:30.327
GABRIEL: For the record,
this is a mistake.

24:30.367 --> 24:32.297
RUBY: For the record,
I disagree.

24:37.867 --> 24:39.797
(Dog barking)

24:46.600 --> 24:48.530
(Goat bleating)

24:58.167 --> 25:00.167
Remind me why we're here.

25:00.200 --> 25:02.170
He needs help.

25:02.200 --> 25:04.370
Yes, but not from us.

25:04.400 --> 25:06.400
He says he's not a junkie.

25:06.433 --> 25:08.373
Oh, well, if he says it...

25:38.533 --> 25:40.473
This is my brother, Suresh.

25:41.467 --> 25:43.027
Suresh?

25:45.467 --> 25:47.267
Hi, I'm Dr Walker.

25:48.200 --> 25:49.570
This is Dr Varma.

25:52.700 --> 25:54.630
How are you feeling?

25:56.333 --> 25:58.573
- When did this happen?
BOY: Last week.

25:58.600 --> 26:01.100
- And just this arm, yeah?
- Yeah.

26:03.800 --> 26:06.170
Hold still, I'll be as gentle
as I can.

26:19.800 --> 26:21.530
What happened?

26:22.500 --> 26:23.770
He got burned.

26:25.100 --> 26:26.270
How?

26:26.300 --> 26:28.100
Does it matter?

26:28.133 --> 26:29.733
It does if you want us
to help him.

26:34.233 --> 26:36.803
It happened in the storm
last week.

26:36.833 --> 26:39.703
He was touching the light switch
when the power came back on.

26:39.733 --> 26:43.373
The shock threw him across the
room and set his shirt on fire.

26:43.400 --> 26:45.330
Why didn't you just say that?

26:45.367 --> 26:48.027
Because they've been
stealing electricity.

26:48.067 --> 26:51.197
There's some pretty big fines
for that these days.

26:51.233 --> 26:52.733
Not just fines.

26:52.767 --> 26:56.427
Not if you've been arrested
before.

26:56.467 --> 27:00.067
This is very badly infected.
There's nothing I can do here.

27:00.100 --> 27:02.430
- You have to come to hospital.
- No.

27:05.533 --> 27:07.573
We won't tell anyone
how it happened.

27:09.767 --> 27:11.767
How do we know we can trust you?

27:11.800 --> 27:13.800
Trust me when I say this.

27:13.833 --> 27:16.533
If he doesn't get help today,
he'll lose his arm.

27:19.500 --> 27:22.600
I've brought some cushions.
Kathakali can go on a bit.

27:22.633 --> 27:25.473
I don't want the Farmer Giles to
rear their ugly heads again.

27:25.500 --> 27:27.830
One good thing about
going out with a doctor -

27:27.867 --> 27:29.167
instant treatment.

27:29.200 --> 27:32.430
You'd think so, wouldn't you?
But she says it ruins the magic.

27:32.467 --> 27:35.127
Especially if it's anything to
do with my nether regions.

27:35.167 --> 27:38.097
Women, eh?
How is Dr Fonseca, anyway?

27:38.133 --> 27:40.603
Oh, you know.

27:40.633 --> 27:42.573
It's good. Great, actually.

27:43.867 --> 27:46.027
We really are gonna play poker.

27:46.067 --> 27:48.067
Big stakes too.

27:48.100 --> 27:50.770
If you must know, I did throw
a bit of a spanner in the works.

27:50.800 --> 27:53.400
I sort of...
accidentally mentioned marriage.

27:53.433 --> 27:54.833
Sort of accidentally?

27:54.867 --> 27:57.627
I just... I was testing the
water, see what she'd think.

27:57.667 --> 27:59.367
She just laughed,

27:59.400 --> 28:02.200
like been wed to me
was, like, this big joke.

28:04.867 --> 28:07.197
Sorry, am I supposed
to say something?

28:07.233 --> 28:09.233
Ideally, yeah.

28:09.267 --> 28:11.267
Not sure what to say, really.

28:11.300 --> 28:13.730
With me and Mags,
it was always plain sailing,

28:13.767 --> 28:15.767
even after 40-odd years.

28:15.800 --> 28:19.370
Mind you, when I first met her I
pretended to be mean and moody.

28:19.400 --> 28:21.400
You know,
James Dean kind of thing.

28:21.433 --> 28:25.533
Every time she spoke to me, I'd
just grunt and light up a fag.

28:25.567 --> 28:27.297
How did that work out?

28:27.333 --> 28:29.373
She went out with my best mate
for two years.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.300
Last time I talk to you
about my love life.

28:31.333 --> 28:33.273
I do hope so.

28:40.600 --> 28:43.530
AJ, I just got off the phone
with Mala.

28:43.567 --> 28:46.467
Mr Khattri's impressed with you
and so is Mandeep.

28:46.500 --> 28:49.070
In fact, she wants to see you
tonight, again.

28:49.100 --> 28:51.100
- I mean, just the two of you.
- Yay!

28:51.133 --> 28:54.403
Oh, give her a chance, AJ.
These things take time.

28:54.433 --> 28:56.573
A bit like you proposing
to Mala?

28:56.600 --> 28:59.270
I'm going to get to it
when the moment is right.

28:59.300 --> 29:01.070
I want everything to be perfect.

29:01.100 --> 29:03.370
And don't go round
changing the subject!

29:03.400 --> 29:05.400
Lydia...

29:05.433 --> 29:10.433
can you give some advice to my
son about matters of the heart?

29:10.467 --> 29:13.667
I'm too busy to think of a good
excuse so I'm just gonna say,

29:13.700 --> 29:15.800
no, I don't want to ever.

29:15.833 --> 29:17.133
MARI: Lydia?
- Yeah?

29:17.167 --> 29:19.197
An emergency call
from Kulungara Road.

29:19.233 --> 29:21.303
- What have we got?
- Reya Kohli.

29:26.067 --> 29:28.697
(Siren wails)

29:28.733 --> 29:31.703
Move out of the way, please.
Move out of the way. Excuse me.

29:35.667 --> 29:39.097
- How long's she been like this?
- Ten minutes or more, maybe.

29:39.133 --> 29:41.603
Everybody get back. (Speaks
Malayalam) Get back!

29:41.633 --> 29:43.473
Reya, can you hear me?

29:49.867 --> 29:52.027
- Dr Fonseca.
- She's arrested.

29:52.067 --> 29:54.527
Where the hell have you been?

29:54.567 --> 29:56.327
Get that thing here now.

29:57.467 --> 29:59.227
Charge it to 200. Quick!

30:03.133 --> 30:05.533
(Defibrillator battery whirs
then bleeps)

30:05.567 --> 30:07.127
It's ready.

30:07.167 --> 30:09.167
Stand back!
Everyone, stand back!

30:09.200 --> 30:10.570
Back!

30:10.600 --> 30:12.530
(Rapid bleeping)

30:13.833 --> 30:15.233
(Reya gasps)

30:17.633 --> 30:19.673
We've got a pulse.
Get the stretcher!

30:27.067 --> 30:30.127
The infection's bad but there's
a clear line of demarcation.

30:30.167 --> 30:32.167
That far?

30:32.200 --> 30:34.600
Yes, necrotic tissue
isn't always visible,

30:34.633 --> 30:36.573
so we need to make sure.

30:38.733 --> 30:42.173
You already did an appendectomy,
you're more than capable.

30:46.233 --> 30:48.573
Keep going, a little deeper.

30:49.633 --> 30:51.173
That's it.

30:52.200 --> 30:54.130
You're doing well.

30:55.233 --> 30:57.233
- Was that a compliment?
- No.

30:57.267 --> 30:59.197
Just a fact.

31:05.367 --> 31:08.227
RUBY: Do you think he'll be able
to keep it free of infection?

31:08.267 --> 31:11.427
Antibiotics aside, his place
isn't exactly germ-free.

31:11.467 --> 31:14.667
True. But what else can we do?

31:14.700 --> 31:17.830
That electric wiring,
I mean, it's insane.

31:17.867 --> 31:20.697
When I was a kid in Mumbai,
there was this lamppost

31:20.733 --> 31:22.733
outside our front door.

31:22.767 --> 31:26.167
It was like a spider's web
of electric cables.

31:26.200 --> 31:29.400
When it rained, sparks would
shoot out all over the street.

31:31.433 --> 31:32.803
You grew up in Mumbai?

31:33.833 --> 31:35.773
Yes. In Dharavi.

31:37.200 --> 31:39.200
It's like a city within a city.

31:40.367 --> 31:43.127
- Like a slum?
- Mm-hm.

31:43.167 --> 31:45.497
I always thought you went to
some posh boarding school.

31:46.600 --> 31:47.830
I did.

31:47.867 --> 31:49.567
I wouldn't call it posh,
exactly.

31:49.600 --> 31:51.170
I got a scholarship
when I was 12.

31:56.100 --> 31:57.300
What?

31:57.333 --> 32:00.273
So you grew up in a slum and
then got sent away to school?

32:00.300 --> 32:01.600
Yes.

32:06.133 --> 32:08.073
That's it?
That's all I'm getting?

32:15.100 --> 32:16.400
OK.

32:23.733 --> 32:25.673
(Monitor bleeping)

32:33.100 --> 32:36.330
I just spoke to the ICU
at Kochi.

32:36.367 --> 32:40.097
They're sending a medevac team.
Should be here in an hour or so.

32:40.133 --> 32:42.033
Any change?

32:43.333 --> 32:45.003
No.

32:48.433 --> 32:50.373
How long was she down for?

32:58.867 --> 33:01.767
Why don't you take a break?
You look tired.

33:01.800 --> 33:04.330
I'll check out the ultrasound,
see what it's showing.

33:04.367 --> 33:07.597
No need to do that,
they'll do an echo in Kochi.

33:07.633 --> 33:10.803
Yeah, but whatever information
we give them could help.

33:10.833 --> 33:13.773
All we can do is concentrate
on keeping her stable.

33:13.800 --> 33:15.800
The ultrasound won't help.

33:15.833 --> 33:17.773
In your opinion.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.370
Lydia, there's nothing more
you can do.

33:36.133 --> 33:38.373
I've just heard. How is she?

33:40.700 --> 33:43.300
Please.

33:43.333 --> 33:47.433
For ten minutes, she had
minimal, if any, cardiac output.

33:47.467 --> 33:49.427
Which means if she survives,

33:49.467 --> 33:52.597
it's highly likely she'll
have significant brain damage.

33:52.633 --> 33:55.373
She seemed...
I thought she was doing good.

33:55.400 --> 34:00.230
And you were wrong, which is why
I told you not to interfere.

34:01.400 --> 34:03.230
I was trying to help her.

34:03.267 --> 34:05.597
Well, now she has
life-changing injuries

34:05.633 --> 34:08.572
and a child with no-one
to look after him.

34:08.600 --> 34:11.800
That's on you.
I hope you can live with it.

34:11.833 --> 34:14.103
- Lydia...
- Now get out of my hospital!

34:28.167 --> 34:30.097
(Mari chatters, child babbles)

34:32.167 --> 34:34.097
(Mari whispers) OK, ssh.

34:36.067 --> 34:38.067
I've spoken to social services.

34:38.100 --> 34:41.230
They're trying to find someone
to look after him

34:41.266 --> 34:44.097
till we know more.

34:44.132 --> 34:46.132
- OK, thank you.
- (Child babbles)

34:46.167 --> 34:47.496
Yes.

34:47.533 --> 34:52.273
Erm...is it OK if I carry him
for a bit longer?

34:52.300 --> 34:54.030
Yeah, it's fine.

34:54.067 --> 34:55.667
Thank you.

34:59.767 --> 35:01.697
(Percussive instruments playing)

35:03.300 --> 35:05.230
(Traditional singing)

35:13.667 --> 35:15.597
So is that one a demon?

35:17.100 --> 35:18.630
No, he's a god.

35:18.667 --> 35:22.697
That's why he saved the Princess
from the snake in the forest.

35:22.733 --> 35:24.733
How d'you know that?

35:24.767 --> 35:26.697
Read the story last night.

35:27.867 --> 35:30.127
Tried to, anyway.

35:30.167 --> 35:32.097
(Percussion continues)

35:33.767 --> 35:35.697
(Singing resumes)

35:39.400 --> 35:41.330
- Shite.
- What?

35:43.133 --> 35:44.703
Did I put my camera in your bag?

35:44.733 --> 35:45.933
No.

35:45.967 --> 35:49.597
Must've left it in the tuk-tuk.
Oh, for Christ's sake!

35:52.800 --> 35:55.230
Stupid, so bloody stupid!

35:59.367 --> 36:01.367
It's probably for the best.

36:01.400 --> 36:03.330
That'd probably crack your lens.

36:09.833 --> 36:11.773
It's just a camera.

36:23.333 --> 36:25.273
(Applause)

36:28.433 --> 36:31.233
There you go.

36:31.267 --> 36:34.167
Now, there's a nice little Irish
bar just round the corner

36:34.200 --> 36:35.600
if you fancy a quick snifter?

36:35.633 --> 36:38.403
Nah, let's just get back.

36:38.433 --> 36:40.433
I'm just tired, that's all.

36:40.467 --> 36:43.027
I never sleep right
in this bloody country.

36:43.067 --> 36:47.827
Look, I know this is none
of my business, but...

36:47.867 --> 36:51.027
the things you've been doing,
the places you've been going...

36:51.067 --> 36:53.067
not very you, is it?

36:53.100 --> 36:55.600
I'm on holiday!
What do you want me to say?

36:55.633 --> 36:59.403
Don't want you to say anything,
I'm just trying to be a mate.

36:59.433 --> 37:02.373
All right, Sherlock sodding
Holmes, you're right.

37:02.400 --> 37:05.130
I didn't want to see
this stupid theatre thing.

37:05.167 --> 37:08.097
I didn't want to wander around
a temple in 100-degree heat

37:08.133 --> 37:10.733
and I didn't want to catch
a boat to a bloody ashram.

37:10.767 --> 37:13.267
These are things that
Maggie wanted to do,

37:13.300 --> 37:16.470
things we were gonna do together
but we never had the time.

37:17.733 --> 37:20.503
There. I've said it.

37:21.233 --> 37:22.703
Now what?

37:27.133 --> 37:28.633
Exactly.

37:43.533 --> 37:45.533
The medevac team are here.

37:45.567 --> 37:47.497
I'll be there in a minute.

37:55.300 --> 37:57.300
I know what you're going to say.

37:57.333 --> 37:58.773
Do you?

37:58.800 --> 38:01.700
You've had a one-woman
discussion within your head

38:01.733 --> 38:03.733
and resolved everything?

38:03.767 --> 38:07.667
It was unprofessional of me
to lose my temper, I know.

38:07.700 --> 38:11.170
But that bloody woman
winds me up!

38:11.200 --> 38:16.100
If it was me, I'd like to think
about why these things happen.

38:16.133 --> 38:20.073
I'd like you, as one of my
dearest friends, to ask,

38:20.100 --> 38:22.770
if my personal feelings
are clouding my judgment.

38:26.167 --> 38:28.597
We need to accept
what we are responsible for.

38:29.533 --> 38:31.473
The mistakes we made.

38:32.633 --> 38:34.333
Have you finished?

38:34.367 --> 38:35.697
Good.

38:40.367 --> 38:42.297
Careful with her.

38:48.333 --> 38:50.333
(Ambulance doors close)

38:50.367 --> 38:51.727
(Siren blares)

39:02.733 --> 39:06.173
We've cleaned up the wound,
he should make a full recovery.

39:06.200 --> 39:07.470
Thank you so much.

39:07.500 --> 39:10.770
They'll bring him out and you
can see him when he wakes up.

39:10.800 --> 39:12.130
OK.

39:12.167 --> 39:13.567
Wait.

39:16.133 --> 39:18.303
If you're going to keep
stealing electricity,

39:18.333 --> 39:20.503
you need a circuit breaker,

39:20.533 --> 39:23.133
something to cut the power
when a surge comes through.

39:25.633 --> 39:27.803
- Who's going to pay for that?
- I will...

39:30.633 --> 39:32.573
..when you bring her bike back.

39:47.600 --> 39:49.700
Hi, you're right on time,
obviously.

39:49.733 --> 39:51.703
What can I get you to drink?

39:51.733 --> 39:53.473
Water, no ice, no lemon?

39:53.500 --> 39:56.400
- Tequila, two shot glasses.
- Coming right up.

39:58.233 --> 40:01.433
You're not seriously telling me
you believed that act?

40:01.467 --> 40:04.367
It's just so my father doesn't
look too closely at my life.

40:06.633 --> 40:08.233
Leave the bottle.

40:09.433 --> 40:11.203
Easy, tiger.

40:14.433 --> 40:19.103
So the whole Clark Kent glasses
spinster thing is just an act?

40:19.133 --> 40:21.703
These are my actual glasses,
I'm short-sighted.

40:21.733 --> 40:24.703
Although it does help the act.

40:24.733 --> 40:26.833
Anything to keep
my father off my back.

40:26.867 --> 40:30.467
Don't get me started on my dad.
Life is pretty boring right now.

40:30.500 --> 40:32.700
AJ, life is only boring
if you get caught.

40:36.267 --> 40:37.527
Cheers!

40:39.167 --> 40:40.227
Cheers!

41:11.767 --> 41:13.727
I thought your shift
had finished?

41:13.767 --> 41:15.767
These things get in such a mess.

41:15.800 --> 41:18.230
I'm just trying to get ahead
for tomorrow.

41:21.067 --> 41:23.067
- Mari, are you OK?
- Good, thank you.

41:25.733 --> 41:28.573
(Sniffs) Er...

41:28.600 --> 41:31.370
I haven't heard from him
if that's what you mean.

41:31.400 --> 41:33.530
It's fine, I'm glad.

41:37.300 --> 41:39.470
If you like, we could go
for a few drinks,

41:39.500 --> 41:41.430
maybe even make a night of it?

41:43.833 --> 41:46.003
I don't think
I'm ready for that yet.

41:47.733 --> 41:50.433
You could find someone else.

41:50.467 --> 41:52.727
One of the other doctors,
perhaps?

41:52.767 --> 41:53.627
(Both chuckle)

41:53.667 --> 41:56.497
Actually I'm...
feeling quite knackered.

41:57.467 --> 41:59.397
So I'm gonna head home.

42:01.100 --> 42:03.200
- Good night, Ruby.
- Good night, Mari.

42:56.633 --> 42:59.333
I did what I thought was best.

42:59.367 --> 43:01.297
I thought I was helping her.

43:03.267 --> 43:05.197
She was badly let down.

43:07.600 --> 43:09.270
I know.

43:10.533 --> 43:12.473
Not just by you.

43:42.433 --> 43:44.433
You look like
you could use a drink.

43:44.467 --> 43:46.467
More than one.

43:46.500 --> 43:48.130
Here you go.

43:48.167 --> 43:51.497
Although I should point out that
er...one of these is for me.

43:51.533 --> 43:53.473
If you don't mind the company.

44:05.233 --> 44:08.503
Did you know you can tell how
many hours of daylight are left

44:08.533 --> 44:12.603
by putting your fingers
flat to the horizon like this?

44:12.633 --> 44:16.133
Each finger's about 15 minutes,
give or take.

44:20.267 --> 44:23.097
Have I just ruined a lovely
moment by being boring?

44:24.467 --> 44:26.427
(She chuckles)

44:26.467 --> 44:28.727
No. No, it's fine.

44:30.400 --> 44:32.330
I'm in the mood for boring.

45:12.433 --> 45:14.233
"Dear Ruby.

45:14.267 --> 45:15.827
Even though
we have never met,

45:15.867 --> 45:18.597
I have thought about you
all through your life.

45:18.633 --> 45:21.373
Your father is my brother

45:21.400 --> 45:23.730
and there are many things
you need to know.

45:24.667 --> 45:26.367
Can we meet?

45:26.400 --> 45:27.730
Kabir Nambeesan."

45:28.305 --> 45:34.556
