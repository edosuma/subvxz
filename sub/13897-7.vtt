WEBVTT

00:05.790 --> 00:07.380
SHOULD'VE GOT DES TO DO THIS.

00:07.420 --> 00:09.090
I DON'T SEE YOU OVER HERE.

00:09.130 --> 00:10.630
-AH!
-&lt;LAUGHS&gt;

00:12.260 --> 00:15.140
OH, WOW.
THAT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY CLEAR.

00:15.180 --> 00:16.300
I TAKE IT BACK. NICE WORK.

00:16.350 --> 00:20.140
WHY ARE WE DOING
THIS STUPID WORKER'S
COMP CASE ANYWAY?

00:20.180 --> 00:23.140
MONEY, TO MAKE A LIVING,
TO PAY THE BILLS, MORON.

00:23.190 --> 00:25.190
CLYDE COWLEY?
"DIME-BAG CLYDE"?

00:25.230 --> 00:28.110
I KNEW THIS GUY IN
HIGH SCHOOL. THIS IS OUR
WORKER'S COMP CASE?

00:28.150 --> 00:30.570
OH, I REMEMBER. YOU WERE
ALWAYS JEALOUS OF HIM.

00:30.610 --> 00:31.950
IT WAS EMBARRASSING.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.280
I WASN'T JEALOUS OF HIM.

00:33.320 --> 00:35.660
CLYDE WAS A TOTAL JERK,
ESPECIALLY TO WALTER.

00:35.700 --> 00:38.120
YOU WERE IN LOVE
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND.

00:38.160 --> 00:41.370
I WASN'T IN LOVE WITH HER.
SHE WAS JUST VERY...

00:41.410 --> 00:44.920
VERY ATTRACTIVE. CLYDE AND I,
WE HAD THIS KIND OF

00:44.960 --> 00:46.500
FIGHT-ON-SIGHT CLAUSE.

00:49.250 --> 00:51.300
-"WHIPLASH"?
-NUMBER ONE FRAUD CLAIM.

00:51.340 --> 00:54.220
TALK ABOUT A FALL FROM GRACE.
THIS GUY, HE HAD
EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW?

00:54.260 --> 00:57.220
A BASEBALL SCHOLARSHIP,
HE WAS MR. ATHLETE.
HE GOT ALL THE GIRLS.

00:57.260 --> 01:00.640
YEAH, WELL, THAT WAS THEN.
NOW HIS FINANCES
ARE IN THE TOILET,

01:00.680 --> 01:02.480
INJURIES. HE'S GOING
THROUGH A ROUGH TIME.

01:02.520 --> 01:04.140
IS HE STILL WITH JESSICA?

01:04.190 --> 01:06.100
AS FAR AS I KNOW. VULTURE.

01:06.150 --> 01:08.650
I'M NOT A VULTURE, DAD.
SHE'S JUST SUPER HOT.

01:08.690 --> 01:10.280
&lt;CAR DOOR CLOSING&gt;

01:10.320 --> 01:11.860
[MAL] THERE HE GOES.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.780
MAN, HE LOOKS LIKE CRAP.

01:19.120 --> 01:22.120
WHATEVER HE'S AT, THE
WHIPLASH ISN'T HINDERING IT.

01:30.170 --> 01:31.170
ARE YOU SEEING THIS?

01:32.960 --> 01:34.300
UH, DAD...

01:37.180 --> 01:38.220
CLYDE!

01:45.310 --> 01:47.060
I'LL CUT HIM DOWN, DAD.

01:53.030 --> 01:54.110

LOSER FAT KID. &lt;LAUGHS&gt;

02:40.160 --> 02:41.740
HIS NAME IS WALTER,

I'M JAKE, AND THIS IS
MY FATHER, MALACHY.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.830
CLYDE, WERE YOU TRYING
TO KILL YOURSELF?

02:47.870 --> 02:51.210

YOU'RE FINE,

03:01.300 --> 03:02.350
BUT YOU NEED TO REST.

03:03.260 --> 03:04.560

03:06.520 --> 03:07.930
I'M FINE, SO...

03:09.140 --> 03:11.060
YOU GUYS CAN JUST

03:11.100 --> 03:12.110
GO AWAY NOW.

03:15.070 --> 03:17.610
HEY, SON, HOLD UP.

03:17.650 --> 03:19.200
IF YOU WERE TRYING
TO KILL YOURSELF,

03:19.240 --> 03:21.410
WE COULD HAVE YOU
TAKEN INTO CUSTODY, SO, UH,

03:21.450 --> 03:22.910
WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL US
WHAT'S GOING ON?

03:22.950 --> 03:24.330
&lt;GROANING&gt;

03:26.330 --> 03:28.040
OKAY, LOOK, JAKE,

03:28.080 --> 03:31.710
SINCE HIGH SCHOOL I HAVEN'T
EXACTLY BEEN CARRYING ON
AS THE GUY I WAS.

03:31.750 --> 03:33.380
REALLY, I HADN'T NOTICED?

03:33.920 --> 03:35.170
I AM A WINNER.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.380
I HAD A GOOD JOB,

03:37.420 --> 03:39.590
A HOUSE, A MARRIAGE,

03:39.630 --> 03:41.010
THEN A FEW MONTHS AGO

03:41.050 --> 03:42.760
EVERYTHING WENT
A LITTLE SNAKY.

03:42.800 --> 03:44.600
-OH, YEAH?
-[CLYDE] I LOST MY JOB,

03:44.640 --> 03:46.310
COULDN'T FIND WORK.

03:46.350 --> 03:48.430
IT WAS LIKE AFTER SPENDING
MY WHOLE LIFE ON TOP,

03:48.470 --> 03:50.390
SUDDENLY I WAS CURSED.

03:50.440 --> 03:51.640
[JAKE] WELL, YOU KNOW,

03:54.940 --> 03:57.400

THING IN HIGH SCHOOL...

03:58.860 --> 04:01.740
WHY AM I STILL LISTED

04:01.780 --> 04:03.490

07:50.800 --> 07:51.800
&lt;CLYDE SNORING&gt;

07:55.760 --> 07:56.720
CLYDE.

07:58.470 --> 07:59.850
YOU FELL ASLEEP STANDING UP.

07:59.890 --> 08:02.770
I AM JUST EXHAUSTED.

08:02.810 --> 08:05.360
THAT'S A BAD SIGN. LET ME
GET MY EQUIPMENT. JUST...

08:06.520 --> 08:09.110
I THINK JEFF VALLIS,

08:09.150 --> 08:11.700
THE BANKER,
FORECLOSED ON MY HOUSE

08:11.740 --> 08:14.320
BECAUSE HE'S
SLEEPING WITH JESSICA.

08:14.370 --> 08:16.700
-DO YOU HAVE ANY PROOF?
-NO. BUT

08:16.740 --> 08:18.790
HE'S TRYING TO
MAKE ME LOOK LIKE A LOSER

08:18.830 --> 08:20.500
TO GET HER AWAY FROM ME.

08:20.540 --> 08:22.540
THAT'S WHY &lt;STUTTERS&gt;
I NEED TO

08:22.580 --> 08:24.710
GET THE HOUSE BACK,
FOR JESSICA.

08:24.750 --> 08:26.710
TO SHOW HER THAT I CAN.

08:26.750 --> 08:27.800
WHAT WOULD MAKE YOU THINK THAT

08:27.840 --> 08:29.550
JESSICA'S FOOLING AROUND
ON YOU WITH VALLIS?

08:29.590 --> 08:31.260
-YEAH.
-I DON'T KNOW.

08:31.300 --> 08:32.590
IT'S LIKE THE MINUTE WE
STARTED DEALING

08:32.630 --> 08:34.390
WITH THAT GUY FROM THE BANK

08:34.430 --> 08:36.010
SHE CHANGED. YOU KNOW?

08:36.050 --> 08:37.810
VALLIS SHOWS UP

08:37.850 --> 08:40.850
AND JESS WANTS ME SPENDING
MORE AND MORE.

08:40.890 --> 08:42.520
NOTHING'S GOOD ENOUGH
FOR HER.

08:42.560 --> 08:44.850
I KEPT REMORTGAGING THE HOUSE
JUST TO KEEP UP.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.690
AND THEN VALLIS FORECLOSES.

08:46.730 --> 08:48.520
I COULDN'T MAKE
THE PAYMENTS.

08:48.570 --> 08:50.530
BUT VALLIS, HE TOLD ME

08:50.570 --> 08:53.150
HE WOULD HOLD OFF,
BUT HE LIED TO ME.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.450
I FEEL LIKE THEY WERE BOTH
PLAYING ME, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE

08:55.490 --> 08:56.910
FIRST I LOSE THE HOUSE,

08:56.950 --> 08:58.870
AND THEN JESSICA,
SHE WANTS A DIVORCE.

09:00.080 --> 09:03.580
DAD AND I, OR I WILL,
WE'LL JUST GO TALK TO JESSICA.

09:03.620 --> 09:05.790
NO. NO, NO. DON'T DO THAT.
SHE'LL KNOW SOMETHING'S UP.

09:05.830 --> 09:07.630
I'M SURE SHE WILL.

09:07.670 --> 09:09.920
TRUST US. THIS IS OUR JOB.

09:14.050 --> 09:16.180
OKAY. SO,

09:16.220 --> 09:18.680
DROWSINESS IN
STRESSFUL SITUATIONS,

09:18.720 --> 09:20.220
UH, OVER-EXERTION,

09:20.260 --> 09:21.720
&lt;WHISPERS&gt; BED-WETTING,

09:21.770 --> 09:23.640
FEAR,
FIGHT-OR-FLIGHT INSTINCTS,

09:23.680 --> 09:26.730
FEAR OF THUMBTACKS, FLYING,
DRIVING, WALKING OR WATER,

09:26.770 --> 09:28.940
THOSE ARE ALL
SERIOUS, SERIOUS SYMPTOMS.

09:28.980 --> 09:30.940
I HAVE TO CATCH UP
WITH MALACHY.

09:30.980 --> 09:33.610
AH, AH, IT IS
IN MY HUMBLE OPINION

09:33.650 --> 09:35.110
THAT YOU HAVE
A MEDICAL CONDITION

09:35.150 --> 09:36.700
THAT YOU NEED TO SEE
A PHYSICIAN ABOUT.

09:36.740 --> 09:38.120
OR A MED STUDENT,
AND THAT CAN BE ARRANGED.

09:38.160 --> 09:39.330
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

09:39.370 --> 09:41.240
YOU, SIR, ARE A TEXTBOOK

09:41.660 --> 09:42.700
NARCOLEPTIC.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.290
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

09:44.330 --> 09:45.920
HEY, NO. HEY, NO!

09:45.960 --> 09:47.790
YOU'RE IN NO CONDITION
TO DRIVE! GET A CAB!

09:47.830 --> 09:49.670
YOU'RE IN NO CONDITION... AH!

09:49.710 --> 09:51.380
[MAL] I KNOW HE WAS YOUR
ARCH ENEMY IN HIGH SCHOOL,

09:51.420 --> 09:54.170
BUT YOU REALLY HAVE TO
STOP ENJOYING CLYDE'S
SUFFERING SO MUCH.

09:54.220 --> 09:58.430
LOOK, OKAY? HE WAS A TERROR
TO EVERYONE, DAD, OKAY?

09:58.470 --> 10:00.180
HE PICKED ON WALTER EVERY
CHANCE THAT HE GOT.

10:00.220 --> 10:02.100
I CAN'T HELP
BUT THINK THAT THIS

10:02.140 --> 10:03.970
WHOLE THING, YOU KNOW,
IT MIGHT BE KARMA.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.100
YEAH, WELL, WATCH YOURSELF.

10:05.140 --> 10:06.770
THERE'S PLENTY OF KARMA
TO GO AROUND.

10:06.810 --> 10:08.690
-CLYDE'S LUXURY APARTMENT.
-&lt;JAKE LAUGHS&gt;

10:09.770 --> 10:11.940
HE ENDED UP LIVING IN HIS CAR.

10:11.980 --> 10:13.480
I GOTTA SAY, THAT'S PERFECT.

10:13.530 --> 10:14.690
THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL KARMA.

10:14.740 --> 10:16.450
STARTING TO SEE YOUR FUTURE?

10:16.490 --> 10:17.740
-&lt;LAUGHS&gt;
-VERY FUNNY.

10:17.780 --> 10:19.620
-SOMEONE LEAVING
NEWSPAPERS AROUND.
-&lt;DIRT BIKE REVVING&gt;

10:21.660 --> 10:22.950
THEY'RE ALL THE...

10:26.870 --> 10:28.580
SEE? KARMA.

10:29.210 --> 10:30.630
VERY FUNNY.

10:32.630 --> 10:33.710
WHAT IS THIS?

10:37.880 --> 10:39.840
JAKE AND MALACHY DOYLE.

10:39.890 --> 10:42.260
-WHO ARE YOU?
-AH.

10:42.300 --> 10:44.470
A MAN WHO DOESN'T
WASTE ANY TIME.

10:44.520 --> 10:45.680
I RESPECT THAT.

10:46.270 --> 10:48.850
YOUR, UH, CLIENT

10:48.890 --> 10:50.230
IS IN DEBT TO ME.

10:50.270 --> 10:52.230
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WHAT DEBT?

10:52.270 --> 10:53.980
IT'S A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT.

10:54.020 --> 10:56.900
EVEN IN THIS PROVINCE'S
ROBUST ECONOMY.

10:56.940 --> 11:00.240
SO, DO I NOW LOOK TO YOU
FOR COMPENSATION?

11:00.820 --> 11:03.700
US? UH, NO, BOY.

11:03.740 --> 11:05.160
-HOW MUCH?
-&lt;TIRES SCREECHING&gt;

11:06.370 --> 11:08.040
YOU ASK CLYDE HOW MUCH.

11:10.880 --> 11:12.880
WHO WAS PONY TAIL BUDDY?

11:12.920 --> 11:15.670
NO IDEA, BUT I THINK
WE'D BETTER FIND OUT.

11:15.710 --> 11:17.380
JUST PUT IT ON
JAKE DOYLE'S TAB.

11:17.880 --> 11:19.180
[CHILI] HEY, DEADBEAT.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.090
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

11:21.140 --> 11:22.800
I'LL GET IT
BACK TO YOU, I PROMISE.

11:22.850 --> 11:25.970
YOU BET YOU WILL.
SO AS YOU DON'T FORGET...

11:26.020 --> 11:28.230
HEY, WHOA, WHOA, WHAT DO
YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING HERE?

11:29.480 --> 11:31.690
DON'T WORRY. MESSAGE SENT.

11:33.770 --> 11:36.320
CLYDE, YOU WANT TO TELL US
WHAT YOU GOT ON THE GO
WITH THIS GUY?

11:36.360 --> 11:38.150
HE THINKS I ROBBED HIM
OR SOMETHING. I DON'T KNOW.

11:38.190 --> 11:39.900
YEAH, RIGHT. OF COURSE.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.280
[JESSICA] WHAT IS GOING ON?

11:42.870 --> 11:44.580
ARE YOU STALKING ME?

11:44.620 --> 11:46.410
-HI, JESSICA.
-JESS, HONEY,

11:46.450 --> 11:48.870
-DON'T BE LIKE THAT NOW.
-DON'T CALL ME HONEY.

11:50.790 --> 11:51.870
THE BOYS ARE JUST
HELPING ME

11:51.920 --> 11:52.960
FINISH RENOING THE HOUSE,
YOU SEE?

11:53.000 --> 11:55.500
WE'RE GOING TO
KEEP IT PRETTY FOR YOU.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.800
CLYDE, WE DON'T OWN
THE HOUSE ANYMORE, REMEMBER?

11:57.840 --> 12:00.590
THE BANK FORECLOSED WHEN YOU
STOPPED PAYING THE MORTGAGE?

12:00.630 --> 12:02.800
I'M LUCKY THEY'RE
LETTING ME STAY UNTIL
THE END OF THE MONTH.

12:02.840 --> 12:04.470
UH, FAR BE IT
FOR ME TO INTERJECT,

12:04.510 --> 12:06.600
BUT DON'T YOU THINK MAYBE
THAT YOU MIGHT BE JUST...

12:06.640 --> 12:09.180
SLIGHTLY BEING
A LITTLE...
A LITTLE BIT HARD ON HIM?

12:09.230 --> 12:12.480
LOOK, CREEP,
I DON'T REMEMBER
YOU, OKAY? SO DROP IT.

12:12.520 --> 12:15.270
AND YOU,
DO I NEED A RESTRAINING ORDER?

12:15.310 --> 12:17.820
CLYDE, THE PAST IS JUST THAT.

12:17.860 --> 12:21.950
THE PAST. BEST YOU LEFT IT
BEHIND YOU AND MOVED ON.
I HAVE.

12:28.120 --> 12:30.750
[DES] OH, UH, THE NAME'S
CHILI POWER.

12:30.790 --> 12:32.830
-[JAKE] CHILI POWDER?
-POWER.

12:32.870 --> 12:34.170
HIS CHRISTIAN NAME'S LIAM.

12:34.210 --> 12:36.960
LIAM POWER.
HOW DO I KNOW THAT NAME?

12:37.000 --> 12:38.880
I THINK CLYDE'S A NARCOLEPTIC.

12:38.920 --> 12:41.720
-DES?
-SO, CHILI'S FROM AROUND
THE BAY ORIGINALLY,

12:41.760 --> 12:45.340
AND HE MADE SOME MAJOR MONEY
OUT IN FORT MAC
AND NOW HE'S HOME,

12:45.390 --> 12:46.800
AND HE'S LENDING IT OUT
ON THE STREET.

12:46.850 --> 12:48.720
SO, GUESSES ARE...

12:49.220 --> 12:50.890
CLYDE OWES HIM MONEY.

12:53.190 --> 12:55.400
MAN...

12:55.440 --> 12:59.070
OH, HOW DID I GET US
ROPED INTO HELPING THIS
SAD-SACK OF A FELLA?

12:59.110 --> 13:00.610
HE NEEDS OUR HELP,
AND YOU HAVE

13:00.650 --> 13:02.530
A NATURAL INCLINATION
TO HELP PEOPLE.

13:04.530 --> 13:05.820
I DON'T GET IT.
WHERE'S THE JOKE?

13:05.860 --> 13:07.660
THERE ISN'T ONE.
YOU'RE A GOOD BOY, JAKE.

13:07.700 --> 13:08.740
NOW...

13:10.200 --> 13:12.000
GO HELP
YOUR HIGH SCHOOL ENEMY.

13:14.000 --> 13:14.830
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

13:16.000 --> 13:17.630
[CLYDE] I DON'T KNOW,
I GUESS IT ALL

13:17.670 --> 13:19.420
JUST COMES DOWN TO
BAD LUCK, YOU KNOW?

13:19.460 --> 13:22.300
OR IT COULD BE THE FACT
THAT YOU'VE NEVER HAD TO
WORK FOR ANYTHING,

13:22.340 --> 13:25.760
AND YOU'VE BEEN
A DICK TO EVERYONE
FOR YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.

13:25.800 --> 13:29.560
ALL RIGHT. I WAS A JERK.
AT TIMES.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.520
BUT I WAS JUST BETTER
THAN EVERYONE ELSE.

13:31.560 --> 13:33.520
EVERYTHING I TOUCHED
TURNED TO GOLD.

13:33.560 --> 13:36.020
-YOU TRY LIVING WITH THAT.
-YEAH, IT MUST BE TOUGH

13:36.060 --> 13:37.020
LIVING IN YOUR OWN SHADOW.

13:37.060 --> 13:38.860
DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW GOOD I WAS AT BASEBALL?

13:38.900 --> 13:41.940
I WAS THE ONLY PLAYER
IN THIS PROVINCE TO
GET A BASEBALL SCHOLARSHIP.

13:42.440 --> 13:43.690
WHY DIDN'T YOU GO?

13:44.150 --> 13:45.740
JESS WANTED ME TO STAY.

13:46.820 --> 13:47.910
COULDN'T LIVE WITHOUT ME.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.410
NOW SHE DOESN'T EVEN
LOVE ME ANYMORE.

13:53.950 --> 13:55.540
HOW MUCH
DO YOU OWE CHILI?

13:57.120 --> 13:58.580
100 GRAND.

13:59.130 --> 14:00.290
PLUS THE JUICE.

14:01.670 --> 14:03.380
OH, GREAT.

14:03.420 --> 14:06.760
I JUST, I NEEDED A LITTLE BIT,
JUST TO GET BY, AND...

14:06.800 --> 14:08.680
&lt;CHUCKLES&gt; I LOST IT ALL.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.890
-POKER?
-NO, I LITERALLY LOST IT.

14:10.930 --> 14:13.890
IT WAS STOLEN, OR, OR,
OR LOST, OR WHATEVER.

14:13.930 --> 14:16.020
HOW DID YOU
MISPLACE $100,000?

14:16.060 --> 14:17.230
I...

14:18.560 --> 14:20.940
I GOT HOME AND I SAW
JESSICA WITH ANOTHER MAN.

14:22.020 --> 14:24.190
VALLIS. I'M SURE IT WAS HIM.

14:24.230 --> 14:25.950
I GOT NERVOUS AND...

14:26.860 --> 14:28.450
HAD AN EPISODE.

14:28.490 --> 14:31.160
I GET SLEEPY
WHENEVER I'M NERVOUS, OR

14:31.200 --> 14:33.790
EXCITED, OR ANGRY, OR UPSET.

14:33.830 --> 14:35.040
DES WAS RIGHT.
YOU'RE A NARCOLEPTIC.

14:35.080 --> 14:38.420
WHATEVER. I FELL ASLEEP,
PASSED OUT ON THE LAWN,

14:38.460 --> 14:40.420
WOKE UP
AND THE MONEY WAS GONE.

14:40.460 --> 14:44.050
I THINK THAT JESSICA
HAS MY MONEY AND SHE'S
HIDING IT IN THE HOUSE.

14:44.090 --> 14:46.670
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO TO
YOUR HOUSE AND WE'LL
GET IT BACK, OKAY?

14:46.720 --> 14:47.800
REALLY?

14:49.010 --> 14:50.090
YOU'D DO THAT FOR ME?

14:51.180 --> 14:52.510
I'M ACTUALLY
DOING IT FOR MYSELF,

14:52.550 --> 14:54.220
BECAUSE I, I JUST REALLY...

14:54.260 --> 14:56.390
I DON'T WANT TO
DEAL WITH YOU ANYMORE.

14:58.730 --> 15:01.230
[CLYDE] VALLIS RUINED MY LIFE.

15:01.270 --> 15:03.940
OH, YEAH, VALLIS IS
THE PROBLEM HERE. SURE.

15:03.980 --> 15:06.030
FROM THE MINUTE WE MET HIM...

15:06.070 --> 15:07.490
VALLIS!

15:07.990 --> 15:10.240
FANCY SUITS AND WORDS.

15:10.820 --> 15:12.240
VALLIS.

15:12.280 --> 15:14.700
HE'S THE ONE THAT TOLD ME
TO REMORTGAGE THE HOUSE,

15:14.740 --> 15:16.330
HE FORECLOSES ON ME!

15:16.370 --> 15:19.040
ARE YOU EVEN LOOKING FOR
THE MONEY HERE, OR...

15:19.080 --> 15:21.130
JUST GOTTA MAKE SURE
THERE'S NO NEW
MAN-STUFF HERE.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.380
CLYDE, FOCUS, OKAY?

15:23.420 --> 15:26.090
WHERE WOULD YOUR WIFE
HIDE $100,000?

15:27.300 --> 15:28.510
THE SAFE.

15:35.810 --> 15:38.060
DAMN IT. IT'S EMPTY.

15:38.100 --> 15:39.980
NICE. YOU KNOW,
I'M STARTING TO THINK

15:40.020 --> 15:42.810
THAT THERE WAS NO
$100,000 IN THE FIRST PLACE.

15:44.060 --> 15:45.110
&lt;JESSICA LAUGHING&gt;

15:45.150 --> 15:47.530
OH! OH! IF SHE FINDS ME HERE
SHE'LL FREAK. SHE'LL DO IT.

15:47.570 --> 15:49.280
SHE'LL FREAK!
SHE'LL TOTALLY FREAK!

15:49.320 --> 15:51.780
CALM DOWN, CALM DOWN!
JUST GET IN THERE.

15:57.330 --> 15:59.750
MAKE YOURSELF AT HOME.

15:59.790 --> 16:02.420
-I'LL JUST BE A SEC.
-SHE'S WITH VALLIS.
I TOLD YOU.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.170
DON'T YOU LOOK AT HER...

16:07.210 --> 16:08.630
&lt;SNORING&gt;

16:22.140 --> 16:23.810
HEY, ARE WE HAVING
A DRINK OR WHAT?

16:24.440 --> 16:26.230
WALLY!

16:26.270 --> 16:27.980
YOU ALMOST CAUGHT ME NAKED.

16:28.030 --> 16:30.990
OH, SORRY.
DO YOU WANT ME TO RE-ENTER
AND TRY THAT AGAIN?

16:31.740 --> 16:33.200
YOU DEVIL.

16:38.290 --> 16:39.700
YOU SON OF A...

16:46.210 --> 16:47.670
I'M GOING TO GET US SOME WINE.

16:53.300 --> 16:54.470
YES.

16:58.970 --> 17:00.430
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

17:00.470 --> 17:02.770
WHAT AM I DOING? YOU'RE THE
ONE HIDING IN HER CLOSET!

17:02.810 --> 17:04.690
SHE IS MARRIED,
WALTER. MARRIED!

17:04.730 --> 17:06.110
ARE YOU SPYING
ON ME OR SOMETHING?

17:06.150 --> 17:08.480
HAVE YOU NO RESPECT FOR
THE SANCTITY OF MARRIAGE?

17:08.520 --> 17:09.900
THIS WOULD KILL CLYDE.

17:10.820 --> 17:11.990
&lt;WALTER GASPS&gt;

17:12.030 --> 17:13.360
IS, IS THAT CLYDE?

17:13.400 --> 17:16.120
-IS HE DEAD?
-YES, AND, NO.

17:16.160 --> 17:18.580
[JESSICA] WALLY,
IS WHITE OKAY?

17:18.620 --> 17:20.080
THE RED'S
DOWN IN THE BASEMENT.

17:20.120 --> 17:23.410
UH, NO. UH. NO.
NO, RED IS BEST.

17:23.460 --> 17:27.250
UH, WHITE, I GET ALL...
IT MAKES ME ALL, UH, VOMITY.

17:27.290 --> 17:30.670
[JESSICA] OKAY. I'LL GET
THE RED THEN.

17:30.710 --> 17:33.590
YOU'RE JUST JEALOUS
BECAUSE I GOT HER
AND YOU DIDN'T.

17:33.630 --> 17:35.590
WHATEVER, OKAY? JUST HELP
ME GET HIM OUT OF HERE.

17:35.630 --> 17:37.970
HE'S ASLEEP.
IT'S A LONG STORY.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.810
WHAT ARE YOU HELPING
HIM FOR ANYWAY?

17:41.850 --> 17:43.930
HE WAS SUCH A DICK-SMACK
TO US IN HIGH SCHOOL.

17:43.980 --> 17:45.100
OH! &lt;LAUGHS&gt;

17:45.140 --> 17:46.350
YOU REMEMBER THAT TIME

17:46.400 --> 17:47.600
THAT HE BEAT ME UP

17:47.650 --> 17:48.940
AND HE STOLE MY PANTS

17:48.980 --> 17:50.650
-AND MY UNDERWEAR?
-SHH!

17:50.690 --> 17:52.190
YOU WEREN'T
WEARING ANY UNDERWEAR.

17:52.230 --> 17:54.400
-LOOK, THAT'S NOT
THE POINT, OKAY?
-&lt;CELL PHONE RINGING&gt;

17:55.700 --> 17:57.160
[JESSICA] HEY, IS THAT MINE?

17:57.200 --> 18:00.450
UH, YEAH. YEAH. A LITTLE HELP
HERE PLEASE? COULD YOU...

18:04.370 --> 18:06.170
IT'S A TEXT. FROM VALLIS.

18:06.210 --> 18:08.130
-SHE'S MEETING HIM TOMORROW.
-SO?

18:08.670 --> 18:10.170
WHO? HELP!

18:11.210 --> 18:12.300
[JESSICA] WALLY?

18:14.170 --> 18:15.670
SHUT UP, CLYDE.

18:15.720 --> 18:17.510
-CLYDE, SHUT UP!
-&lt;GROANING&gt;

18:20.640 --> 18:21.810
-&lt;CRASH&gt;
-&lt;CAT YOWLS&gt;

18:21.850 --> 18:24.100
-GET OUT.
-THIS ISN'T OVER.

18:24.140 --> 18:25.100
&lt;SCREAMS&gt;

18:27.940 --> 18:29.310
YOU GOT A TEXT! &lt;PANTING&gt;

18:29.860 --> 18:31.480
THANKS.

18:31.520 --> 18:34.610
I, UH, HOPE IT
DOESN'T MAKE YOU VOMITY.

18:38.950 --> 18:42.530
[CLYDE] WAS SHE WITH VALLIS?
WAS IT HIM? I BET IT WAS HIM.

18:42.580 --> 18:46.330
-I KNOW IT WAS HIM!
-IT WASN'T HIM. IT WAS...

18:47.410 --> 18:48.830
IT WAS HER LAWYER,

18:48.870 --> 18:53.210
WHO, BY THE WAY, YOU TORTURED
EVERY DAY IN HIGH SCHOOL.

18:53.250 --> 18:55.960
WALTER? WALTER THE FALTER?

18:56.010 --> 18:57.800
NO WORRIES OF HER
STEPPING OUT WITH HIM.

18:57.840 --> 18:59.180
THE FATTY.

18:59.220 --> 19:00.430
YOU JUST WATCH
YOURSELF, CLYDE.

19:00.470 --> 19:01.600
WHY?

19:04.060 --> 19:05.310
WE GOING TO FIGHT AGAIN?

19:07.060 --> 19:09.730
-LIKE IN HIGH SCHOOL?
-WHOA, WHOA,
SETTLE DOWN, BOYS.

19:09.770 --> 19:11.230
I WOULDN'T
WORRY ABOUT IT, DAD.

19:11.270 --> 19:13.650
FOR CLYDE'S SAKE I DON'T THINK
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA, AND...

19:13.690 --> 19:14.980
WAIT A MINUTE!

19:15.030 --> 19:17.610
WHEN I PASSED OUT,
SHE WAS UNDRESSING.

19:17.650 --> 19:18.860
DID YOU SEE HER NAKED?

19:19.450 --> 19:20.860
DID YOU SEE HER NAKED?

19:21.990 --> 19:24.240
NO, BOY. SHE, UM...
&lt;CLEARS THROAT&gt;

19:25.410 --> 19:26.540
WENT TO THE BATHROOM.

19:28.660 --> 19:30.620
WE GOTTA FIGURE OUT
THIS SITUATION WITH CHILI.

19:30.670 --> 19:31.830
HE'S A DANGEROUS ONE.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.960
AH, DON'T WORRY ABOUT HIM.
I'LL DEAL WITH HIM.

19:34.000 --> 19:35.670
WE NEED TO DEAL WITH VALLIS.

19:35.710 --> 19:38.170
WHAT'S HIS, UH,
CONNECTION TO JESSICA?

19:38.220 --> 19:40.220
HE WANTS
INTO HER AWESOME PANTS.

19:40.260 --> 19:43.930
HE WORKS AS A LOAN OFFICER
AT THE BANK AND JESSICA

19:43.970 --> 19:46.310
HAS A MEETING WITH HIM AT
10:00 THIS MORNING.

19:46.350 --> 19:48.480
MAYBE SHE WANTS
TO RENEGOTIATE,
GET THE HOUSE BACK!

19:49.850 --> 19:51.350
IT'D BE GOOD TO HAVE
EARS ON THE INSIDE.

19:51.400 --> 19:53.400
YEAH.

19:53.440 --> 19:56.860
WE SHOULD SEND SOMEONE IN
UNDERCOVER, YOU KNOW,
TO PLANT A BUG.

19:56.900 --> 20:01.110
MAYBE, UH, TWO KIDS POSING
AS A YOUNG COUPLE LOOKING
TO BUY A NEW HOME?

20:05.950 --> 20:07.790
[JAKE] OKAY, THAT'S THE
LAPEL CAMERA, ALL RIGHT?

20:07.830 --> 20:10.250
PUT IT SOMEWHERE
WHERE WE CAN'T SEE IT, DES.
THAT'S THE IDEA.

20:10.290 --> 20:12.330
AND THIS IS A BUG, ALL RIGHT?
YOU NEED TO PLANT IT,

20:12.370 --> 20:14.840
BECAUSE I NEED TO HEAR
WHATEVER IS GOING ON IN
VALLIS' OFFICE

20:14.880 --> 20:17.840
AFTER YOU LEAVE. PUT IT ON HIS
DESK, BRIEFCASE, WHATEVER.

20:17.880 --> 20:19.760
OKAY, OKAY, BUT, BUT...
ME AND TINNY?

20:19.800 --> 20:21.430
I MEAN, REALLY?
DON'T YOU THINK
THAT'S KIND OF DANGEROUS?

20:21.470 --> 20:22.840
I MEAN, WE'RE NOT REALLY
IN A GOOD PLACE RIGHT NOW

20:22.880 --> 20:24.550
IF WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A HOUSE TOGETHER.

20:24.590 --> 20:27.220
TINNY'S IN THE BANK
WAITING FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

20:27.260 --> 20:28.430
JUST WAIT.
DON'T GET MAD AT ME.

20:28.470 --> 20:30.180
I'VE BEEN WAITING TO
TALK TO YOU ABOUT THIS.

20:32.020 --> 20:33.190
I THINK TINNY HATES ME.

20:33.650 --> 20:35.150
OF COURSE SHE HATES YOU.

20:35.190 --> 20:37.610
SHE DOES? DID SHE SAY ANYTHING
TO YOU? DID SHE SAY ANYTHING?

20:41.280 --> 20:43.990
SO, I FIXED DES
WITH A LAPEL CAMERA

20:44.030 --> 20:46.450
AND IT SHOULD BE COMING
THROUGH RIGHT NOW.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.500
BANG UP JOB AGAIN.

20:50.540 --> 20:52.790
WILL WE BE FINDING OUT IF
JESS AND VALLIS ARE HAVING
AN AFFAIR NOW OR NOT?

20:52.830 --> 20:55.170
THEY'RE NOT, OKAY?
BUT WE THINK

20:55.210 --> 20:57.880
THAT JESS, YOUR WIFE,
IS STEALING YOUR MONEY.

20:57.920 --> 20:59.630
BUT IF YOUR WIFE WENT ON
A SPENDING SPREE

20:59.670 --> 21:00.880
JUST BEFORE
YOU LOST THE HOUSE...

21:00.920 --> 21:03.130
MAYBE SHE OWES VALLIS MONEY.

21:03.180 --> 21:05.510
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;
-OR MAYBE VALLIS MADE HER
STEAL MY 100 G'S.

21:09.350 --> 21:12.270
-HELLO?
-WE NEED TO TALK RIGHT NOW.

21:12.310 --> 21:14.060
YEAH, NOW'S NOT
A VERY GOOD TIME.

21:15.560 --> 21:17.520
IT WAS... OH, HEY! LOOK.

21:17.560 --> 21:19.230
-[DES] ONE, TWO...
-WE'VE GOT SOUND.

21:19.270 --> 21:20.480
[DES] JAKE, CHECK.

21:21.780 --> 21:24.070
WOW, YOU LOOK AMAZING.

21:24.110 --> 21:27.280
I MEAN, YOU, YOU LOOK GREAT.
YOU, YOU, YOU LOOK NICE.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.700
JUST DRESSING THE PART.
DON'T FREAK OUT.

21:29.740 --> 21:32.410
OKAY, UM, ALL RIGHT
SO DO WE HAVE A PLAN?

21:32.450 --> 21:33.710
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE PLAN?
WE SHOULD HAVE A PLAN.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.250
WAS I SUPPOSED
TO HAVE THE PLAN?

21:35.290 --> 21:37.420
-DES...
-OH, YEAH. HOLD ON A SEC.

21:37.460 --> 21:39.500
MR. VALLIS, I'M SORRY WE
DON'T HAVE AN APPOINTMENT,

21:39.540 --> 21:41.420
BUT CAN WE JUST HAVE
A MINUTE OF YOUR TIME?

21:42.210 --> 21:43.340
CALL YOU BACK.

21:45.090 --> 21:46.970
I THINK IT'S THE RIGHT THING
FOR US TO BUY A HOUSE.

21:47.010 --> 21:48.140
DON'T YOU, HONEY?

21:49.510 --> 21:51.520
SO, UH, WHAT CAN I
DO FOR YOU KIDS?

21:51.560 --> 21:53.980
WELL, WE'RE NOT EXACTLY KIDS.
I'M IN MED SCHOOL,

21:54.020 --> 21:55.560
WHICH MAKES ME
A BIT OF A DICK,

21:55.600 --> 21:58.020
BUT WE'RE IN LOVE SO

21:58.060 --> 21:59.820
WE JUST WANT TO
START LOOKING AT HOUSES.

21:59.860 --> 22:00.980
THAT'S WHAT YOU
SPECIALIZE IN, RIGHT?

22:01.020 --> 22:02.400
HOUSES, MORTGAGES?

22:02.440 --> 22:05.200
WELL, FIRST THING'S FIRST.
ARE YOU HERE FOR PRE-APPROVAL

22:05.240 --> 22:06.910
OR DO YOU HAVE
A PROPERTY IN MIND?

22:06.950 --> 22:09.410
OH, I'VE GOT
A PROPERTY IN MIND.

22:09.450 --> 22:10.490
&lt;BREATHES HEAVILY&gt;

22:10.530 --> 22:12.870
DES, ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO GET
ALL SETTLED IN

22:12.910 --> 22:14.080
WITH A MED STUDENT,

22:14.120 --> 22:16.460
BUY A HOUSE,
HAVE LITTLE
MED STUDENT BABIES?

22:16.500 --> 22:18.710
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.

22:18.750 --> 22:21.550
IS HE, UH, IS HE OKAY,
OR... YEAH?

22:21.590 --> 22:22.880
DOESN'T LOOK OKAY.

22:22.920 --> 22:24.510
OH.

22:24.550 --> 22:26.720
OH, MY GOD!
YOU KNOW WHAT? HE'S...

22:26.760 --> 22:28.550
HE'S ALLERGIC TO PAPER.

22:28.590 --> 22:30.600
I THINK HE'S GOING INTO
ANAPHYLACTIC SHOCK!

22:30.640 --> 22:31.430
OH, DEAR.

22:31.470 --> 22:32.970
WHAT IN GOD'S NAME
IS SHE DOING?

22:33.010 --> 22:35.100
OH, MY GOD. YOU'D BETTER
GO GET ONE OF THOSE ALLERGY

22:35.140 --> 22:38.600
NEEDLE PENS OR HE WILL
DIE RIGHT HERE.

22:38.650 --> 22:40.360
I'M FREAKING OUT. I'M SORRY
I'M FREAKING OUT,

22:40.400 --> 22:41.480
BUT WHY ARE YOU
FREAKING ME OUT?

22:41.520 --> 22:44.230

22:56.000 --> 22:58.080

-YEAH, I'M A MED STUDENT.

23:05.210 --> 23:06.880
-TRUST ME.

23:07.670 --> 23:08.430

23:14.470 --> 23:16.810
-YOU KNOW WHAT? HE'S GOING TO
BE JUST FINE IF WE GET...
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

23:16.850 --> 23:19.230
WE'D BETTER GO
TO THE HOSPITAL. THANK YOU.

23:21.480 --> 23:22.610
UNCLE JAKE, WE GOT SOMETHING.

23:24.270 --> 23:25.360
[JAKE] WHAT IS ALL THIS STUFF?

23:25.400 --> 23:27.320
[MAL] LOOKS LIKE
JESSICA'S BANK RECORDS.

23:27.360 --> 23:29.320
HOW'S THAT GOING TO
HELP ME GET JESSICA BACK?

23:30.490 --> 23:32.530
-&lt;GROANS&gt;
-&lt;PEOPLE GASP&gt;

23:32.570 --> 23:34.370
ALL RIGHT, CLYDE, MY SON.

23:35.540 --> 23:37.080
NOW WE DO THIS MY WAY.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.120
DON'T MAKE ME USE IT.

23:40.580 --> 23:42.040
DON'T EVEN THINK OF IT.

23:42.420 --> 23:43.420
&lt;THUD&gt;

23:45.630 --> 23:46.760
&lt;CLYDE SNORING&gt;

23:54.760 --> 23:56.600
SHOULD WE GO AFTER HIM, OR...

23:59.180 --> 24:00.390
OW, THAT HURT.

24:02.690 --> 24:04.650
I MEAN, I FEEL FINE.
I MEAN, I FEEL FINE, LIKE...

24:04.690 --> 24:06.320

I JUST REALLY GOT
SOME LIKE, ENERGY.

24:07.900 --> 24:09.950
I MEAN, SHOULD I BE AT
THE HOSPITAL?
WE SHOULD CALL CHANDRA.

24:10.700 --> 24:12.660
I'LL GET RIGHT ON THAT.

24:12.700 --> 24:15.580
ANYWAYS, WE GOT TO
TRACK DOWN CLYDE,

24:15.620 --> 24:18.370
AND I THINK WE SHOULD
TAKE ON CHILI. I MEAN,

24:18.410 --> 24:19.580
HE CAN'T BE THAT BAD, RIGHT?

24:19.620 --> 24:21.750
-TELL THAT TO YOUR BACK.
-WHAT WAS ALL THAT BACK THERE?

24:21.790 --> 24:23.500
I MEAN, ARE YOU
JEALOUS OR SOMETHING
OF ME AND CHANDRA?

24:23.540 --> 24:25.630
I MEAN, I'M REALLY CONFUSED,
AND WHY'D YOU MAKE HIM
STAB ME THREE TIMES?

24:25.670 --> 24:28.050
I WAS PLAYING THE PART, DES.
GET OVER YOURSELF.

24:30.880 --> 24:32.880
RIGHT. OKAY, SO

24:32.930 --> 24:35.680

TINNY SNAGGED FOR US,

JESSICA HAD A DEPOSIT OF
10 G'S TO HER BANK ACCOUNT
THE SAME DAY

24:39.560 --> 24:41.600
THAT CLYDE'S 100 WENT MISSING.

24:41.640 --> 24:43.520
IS THAT SO?

24:43.560 --> 24:46.110
OKAY, MALACHY, ME AND YOU,
WE'RE GOING TO
GO FIND CHILI POWDER.

I SHOULD GO TALK TO JESSICA...

25:04.330 --> 25:05.960

25:14.300 --> 25:16.550

25:20.350 --> 25:22.310
-IS THAT RIGHT?

25:28.020 --> 25:29.690

25:30.690 --> 25:31.570
HARD TO SAY NO.

25:32.820 --> 25:33.740
APPARENTLY.

25:45.750 --> 25:46.710
[MAL] CHILI?

25:48.670 --> 25:49.670

I RECALL BEING BUSTED
BY YOU A FEW YEARS BACK.

26:06.060 --> 26:08.770
-GOOD FOR YOU.
WHERE'S CLYDE?

26:09.650 --> 26:11.270
IF YOU DON'T GET MY MONEY.

26:12.860 --> 26:14.990
WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

26:15.030 --> 26:17.820
I THINK I HAVE A WAY
TO FIND HIS MONEY.

26:17.860 --> 26:20.580
YOU DON'T HURT HIM,
YOU'LL HAVE IT IN 24 HOURS.

26:21.530 --> 26:23.040
24 HOURS

26:23.080 --> 26:25.830
OR THE CLIENT ENDS UP
IN ST. JOHN'S HARBOR.

26:25.870 --> 26:27.710
SHOW ME
HE'S STILL ALIVE FIRST.

26:34.840 --> 26:36.880
DID YOU DO THIS? HUH?

26:36.930 --> 26:37.930

-YOU AGAIN.
-HI. LISTEN,

27:06.330 --> 27:08.370
UH, I'M JUST CURIOUS.

27:08.420 --> 27:12.040
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CLYDE'S
MISSING $100,000, WOULD YOU?

27:12.090 --> 27:14.630
CLYDE'S? GIVE ME A BREAK.

27:14.670 --> 27:16.590
SO YOU DIDN'T

27:17.670 --> 27:19.970
LOOK, I KNOW THAT

27:20.010 --> 27:22.510
YOU HAD A CRUSH ON ME
YOUR WHOLE LIFE.
I GET THAT.

27:22.550 --> 27:25.520
BUT HONESTLY,
DON'T YOU THINK IT'S TIME
YOU JUST GOT OVER IT?

27:25.560 --> 27:27.020
I THOUGHT YOU DIDN'T
REMEMBER ME.

27:27.060 --> 27:29.100
I DIDN'T. BUT

27:29.140 --> 27:33.480
THEN I DID. SAME LOSER.
SAME CAR.

27:33.520 --> 27:35.610
OH, THAT'S A DIFFERENT
CAR, ACTUALLY.

MAYBE YOU CAN EXPLAIN TO ME,

27:40.110 --> 27:42.820
WHERE DID YOU GET

MONEY WENT MISSING?

27:46.740 --> 27:51.540
-EXCUSE ME?
-WHERE DID YOU GET
THE $10,000?

27:51.580 --> 27:54.750
HOW AND WHERE I GET MY

I DON'T WANT... STOP IT!
STOP GIVING ME YOUR WALLETS!

29:22.260 --> 29:23.550
THIS IS NOT A ROBBERY.

29:23.590 --> 29:26.390
EVERYONE, THIS IS
NOT A ROBBERY!

29:26.430 --> 29:28.890
-YOU'RE A TERRORIST.

29:34.850 --> 29:36.310
&lt;SHOUTING&gt;

29:39.860 --> 29:40.860
&lt;INAUDIBLE&gt;

29:41.530 --> 29:42.900

29:49.330 --> 29:50.740

29:52.120 --> 29:54.500
WHERE AM I?
I'M IN A DIFFERENT ROOM.

29:54.540 --> 29:57.000
AM I BECOMING LIKE HIM?
LIKE CLYDE?
AM I A NARCOLEPTIC?

29:57.040 --> 30:00.000
NO, NO, SWEETHEART.
IT'S JUST THE ADRENALINE FROM
THE ALLERGY PEN WEARING OFF.

30:00.040 --> 30:01.750
I MEAN, HE DIDN'T
BITE ME, DID HE?

30:01.800 --> 30:03.670
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;
-CAN YOU CATCH NARCOLEPSY
IF YOU GET BIT BY ONE?

30:03.720 --> 30:05.220

30:24.360 --> 30:26.780
YOU'RE ACTING SUPER WEIRD.
I CAN TELL.

30:26.820 --> 30:29.280
-AND I KNOW YOU HATE CHANDRA.
-OKAY, I HATE CHANDRA

30:29.320 --> 30:30.870
BECAUSE SHE'S
A SNOBBY LITTLE JERK.

30:30.910 --> 30:32.080
IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU.

30:32.120 --> 30:33.540
WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU
WANT FROM ME HERE.

30:33.580 --> 30:36.920
IT'S LIKE THE MINUTE
I DON'T SHOW ANY INTEREST,

30:36.960 --> 30:38.210
YOU'RE ALL OVER ME.
AND THEN THE NEXT MINUTE,

30:38.250 --> 30:40.290
WHEN I ACTUALLY SHOW
YOU SOME ATTENTION,
YOU TREAT ME LIKE...

30:40.340 --> 30:42.210
-DES!
-WHAT? IT'S TRUE!

30:42.250 --> 30:43.420
SHUT UP.

30:46.130 --> 30:47.130

30:49.010 --> 30:50.850

30:57.520 --> 31:00.650
PUT YOUR HANDS DOWN!
PUT YOUR HANDS DOWN, NOW.

31:00.690 --> 31:02.980
OKAY? EVERYONE JUST

WE'RE NOT ROBBING ANYTHING,

31:09.280 --> 31:11.070
OKAY? PUT IT AWAY.

31:11.120 --> 31:12.870
THIS IS ALL

31:13.830 --> 31:16.120
A HORRIBLE

31:16.160 --> 31:17.710
MISUNDERSTANDING.

31:17.750 --> 31:21.750
ALL RIGHT, NOW WE'RE

WE'LL ALL JUST GO HOME,

31:24.920 --> 31:27.010
PRETEND THIS NEVER HAPPENED,

31:27.050 --> 31:29.680

31:31.510 --> 31:33.600
[LESLIE] JAKE DOYLE,
WE HAVE YOU SURROUNDED.

31:33.640 --> 31:35.350
COME OUT
WITH YOUR HANDS UP!

31:35.390 --> 31:36.850
OH, CRAP.

31:36.890 --> 31:38.690
[MAL] HOW'D THIS HAPPEN?
[ROSE] I HAVE NO CLUE.

31:38.730 --> 31:39.980
HEY, LESLIE,

31:40.020 --> 31:41.770
ANY IDEA WHAT HE'S
DOING IN THERE?

31:41.810 --> 31:43.020
HE'S ROBBING A BANK.

31:43.060 --> 31:44.650
OH, DEAR LORD.

31:44.690 --> 31:46.610
[JAKE] I GOT TO THINK HERE,
I GOT TO THINK. SO, UH...

31:46.650 --> 31:50.820
EVERYONE GET UP AND, UH,
GO OVER THERE TO WHERE
THE GUARD IS TO, RIGHT THERE.

31:50.860 --> 31:52.910
YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T ROBBING
THE PLACE, RIGHT, SO, SO...

31:52.950 --> 31:55.160
I'M NOT ROBBING THE PLACE,
BUT I STILL WANT YOU
TO DO WHAT I SAY.

31:55.200 --> 31:57.580
SO GO, GO, GO. GO, GO, GO!
EVERYONE, KEEP GOING.

31:57.620 --> 31:59.120
KEEP GOING STRAIGHT, STRAIGHT,
STRAIGHT. THERE YOU GO.

31:59.160 --> 32:00.540
GET OVER THERE, EVERYONE.

32:00.580 --> 32:03.130
JAKE, ARE YOU
ROBBING THE PLACE?

32:03.170 --> 32:05.210
-ARE YOU
OUT OF YOUR MIND?
-OH, WELCOME BACK!

32:06.130 --> 32:07.760
DIPSHIT.

32:07.800 --> 32:10.090
-VALLIS?
-YEAH. YEAH.

32:10.130 --> 32:13.590
-YOU SON OF A BITCH!
-YOU! STAY!

32:15.100 --> 32:16.010
STAY.

32:18.220 --> 32:20.980
OKAY, VALLIS. SIT.

32:21.020 --> 32:24.230
ALTHOUGH CLYDE HERE
IS THE SOLE REASON
I AM IN THIS PREDICAMENT,

32:24.270 --> 32:26.150
I AM STILL
GOING TO BLAME YOU

32:26.190 --> 32:27.730
AND I'M GOING
TO SHOOT YOU

32:27.780 --> 32:30.030
IF YOU DON'T ANSWER
MY QUESTIONS DIRECTLY.

32:30.070 --> 32:31.650
-DO YOU UNDERSTAND?
-YES.

32:31.700 --> 32:34.410
OKAY. CLYDE THINKS THAT
YOU'RE SCREWING HIM OVER

32:34.450 --> 32:36.410
AND THERE ARE CURRENTLY
THREE CHARGES AGAINST YOU.

32:36.450 --> 32:39.200
NUMBER ONE.
HE THINKS THAT YOU'RE SLEEPING
WITH HIS WIFE, JESSICA.

32:39.250 --> 32:41.250
WHAT? NO.
THAT, THAT'S INSANE.

32:41.290 --> 32:43.170
I KNOW.
I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU,

32:43.210 --> 32:45.330
BECAUSE PERSONALLY
I REALLY DON'T THINK

32:45.380 --> 32:47.630
THAT YOU'RE HER TYPE.
I MEAN, THE HAIR COLOR,

32:47.670 --> 32:49.170
THE WAY YOU DRESS,
IT'S ALL WRONG.

32:50.090 --> 32:51.760
ANYWAY, CHARGE NUMBER TWO.

32:51.800 --> 32:54.930
HE THINKS THAT YOU STOLE
$100,000 FROM HIM.

32:54.970 --> 32:57.430
LOOKING AT YOU,
I REALLY DON'T THINK
YOU'RE THAT STUPID.

32:57.470 --> 32:59.390
I DIDN'T ROB
ANY 100 GRAND, NO.

32:59.430 --> 33:02.140
THAT BRINGS US TO
CHARGE NUMBER THREE.

33:03.770 --> 33:06.190
THAT YOU FORECLOSED
ON HIS HOUSE EARLY

33:06.230 --> 33:08.110
AND WITHOUT JUST CAUSE.

33:10.400 --> 33:11.690
RIGHT.

33:12.860 --> 33:15.070
NOW THE QUESTION I HAVE
FOR YOU, MR. VALLIS,

33:16.820 --> 33:17.990
IS WHY?

33:19.080 --> 33:21.370
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;
-&lt;PEOPLE GASP&gt;

33:21.410 --> 33:23.460
RELAX, EVERYONE.
IT'S A PHONE. OKAY?

33:23.500 --> 33:25.710
-JUST...
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

33:27.750 --> 33:29.300
STAY AWAKE.

33:29.340 --> 33:31.550
-HELLO?
-HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?

33:31.590 --> 33:33.010
WHY ARE YOU ROBBING A BANK?

33:33.050 --> 33:34.300
[JAKE] I AM NOT
ROBBING A BANK.

33:34.340 --> 33:35.840
IT SURE LOOKS
THAT WAY TO ME.

33:35.880 --> 33:38.510
YEAH, I KNOW IT LOOKS
THAT WAY, DAD.
THANKS... THANKS FOR THE

33:38.550 --> 33:41.560
BRILLIANT INSIGHT. OKAY?
YOU JUST KEEP EVERYONE
OUT THERE CALM,

33:41.600 --> 33:43.180
AND DON'T LEAVE
UNTIL YOU HEAR FROM ME.

33:44.520 --> 33:45.520
ANY LUCK?

33:46.440 --> 33:48.110
HE HUNG UP!

33:48.150 --> 33:49.690
-HE WHAT?
-&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

33:50.480 --> 33:52.110
YEAH? THIS IS MALACHY.

33:52.150 --> 33:54.150
TELL YOUR BANK ROBBING SON
TO GET ME MY MONEY,

33:54.200 --> 33:57.030
OR CLYDE'S WIFE AND HER
WINNING ATTITUDE ARE TOAST.

33:59.620 --> 34:01.120
YEAH, WHOEVER THIS IS,

34:01.160 --> 34:03.790
TELL CLYDE TO GIVE
THIS GUY HIS MONEY.

34:03.830 --> 34:04.960
&lt;SNAPPING FINGERS&gt;

34:07.290 --> 34:08.290
YOU HAVE ONE HOUR.

34:12.090 --> 34:13.710
&lt;PHONE RINGING&gt;

34:13.760 --> 34:16.300
[LESLIE] JAKE!
ANSWER THE PHONE!

34:16.340 --> 34:18.930
ALL RIGHT, CLYDE,
LET'S JUST GET THIS ALL
OVER WITH, OKAY?

34:18.970 --> 34:21.310
WE KNOW
THAT YOU FORECLOSED
ON CLYDE TOO EARLY

34:21.350 --> 34:24.430
AND YOU BOUGHT EVERY HOUSE
ON THE STREET
FOR OVER MARKET VALUE.

34:24.480 --> 34:25.850
WHAT ARE YOU COOKING UP

34:25.890 --> 34:27.850
AND HOW IS
JESSICA INVOLVED?

34:27.900 --> 34:30.400
OKAY, LOOK, LOOK,
I DID NOT SLEEP WITH HER.

34:30.440 --> 34:31.770
NO, NO. I JUST, UH...

34:31.820 --> 34:35.110
I, UH, PAID HER
A FEW BUCKS TO HELP ME.

34:35.150 --> 34:36.740
HELP YOU DO WHAT?

34:36.780 --> 34:38.280
I WAS USING MY POSITION
HERE AT THE BANK.

34:38.320 --> 34:40.280
I WAS BUYING UP ALL THE LAND.
I HAD A DEAL WITH HIS, UH,

34:40.320 --> 34:41.780
HIS WIFE. IF...

34:41.830 --> 34:44.290
IF SHE WAS ABLE TO
GET HIM, ALL RIGHT,
TO MISS THE PAYMENTS,

34:44.330 --> 34:48.540
I'D FORECLOSE AND, UH...

34:48.580 --> 34:50.080
I'D GIVE HER A PERCENTAGE.

34:51.540 --> 34:52.960
&lt;PEOPLE MURMURING&gt;

34:53.000 --> 34:54.460
PERCENTAGE OF WHAT?
PERCENTAGE OF WHAT?

34:54.510 --> 34:57.050
THERE'S AN OIL DISCOVERY.

34:57.090 --> 34:58.800
APPARENTLY IT WAS HUGE.

34:58.840 --> 35:00.430
I CUT HER IN. WE WERE...

35:00.470 --> 35:02.140
WE WERE GOING TO GET RICH.
THAT'S IT.

35:03.100 --> 35:04.220
SHE SOLD ME OUT.

35:06.230 --> 35:07.480
JESSICA.

37:20.110 --> 37:21.990

37:22.030 --> 37:24.910

38:06.320 --> 38:07.570
WHERE HE STASHED
MY FRIGGING MONEY.

38:07.620 --> 38:09.120
HEY, CHILI.

38:09.450 --> 38:10.580
OH!

38:14.580 --> 38:15.580
&lt;GRUNTS&gt;

38:17.040 --> 38:18.420
NICE.

38:18.460 --> 38:20.960
I SUPPOSE I'LL BE GETTING OUT
OF EVERYONE'S HAIR NOW.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.460
[JAKE] WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
CLYDE, BUDDY! CLYDE!

38:22.510 --> 38:24.420
JUST, JUST, JUST, UH...
JUST PUT THE GUN DOWN.

38:24.470 --> 38:26.470
I THINK WE'VE DONE
ALL WE CAN HERE.

38:27.680 --> 38:29.300
THERE'S NOTHING
LEFT FOR ME.

38:29.350 --> 38:31.850
CLYDE, THINK ABOUT THIS NOW.

38:31.890 --> 38:33.850
JESSICA, SHE'S NEVER
GOING TO TAKE ME BACK.

38:35.810 --> 38:39.980
-I MIGHT AS WELL JUMP.
-CLYDE, HONEY, DON'T.

38:40.020 --> 38:43.440
I'M SORRY. OKAY?
I'M SORRY ABOUT THE HOUSE,

38:43.480 --> 38:44.530
ABOUT EVERYTHING.

38:45.530 --> 38:47.530
-JUST...
-JESSICA.

38:49.200 --> 38:52.200
YOU'RE SAYING
THAT THERE'S A CHANCE?

38:53.200 --> 38:54.330
GOD, NO.

38:55.290 --> 38:56.830
BUT I NEVER MEANT
TO HURT YOU.

38:58.420 --> 39:00.880
&lt;DEEP BREATH&gt;

39:00.920 --> 39:02.670
NOW, CLYDE,
YOU GIVE ME THE GUN.

39:05.210 --> 39:06.380
GIVE ME THE GUN.

39:12.600 --> 39:13.680
OKAY.

39:15.640 --> 39:16.890
LIFE'S TOO SHORT

39:16.930 --> 39:19.270
FOR YOU
TO SPEND IT WITH SOMEONE
WHO HATES YOUR GUTS.

39:20.350 --> 39:21.400
TAKE IT FROM ME.

39:21.440 --> 39:22.820
ALL RIGHT.

39:25.480 --> 39:27.570
THANK YOU.

39:27.610 --> 39:29.660
[LESLIE] JAKE DOYLE,
WE HAVE YOU SURROUNDED!

39:29.700 --> 39:31.570
COME OUT
WITH YOUR HANDS UP!

39:34.700 --> 39:36.450
UH-OH.

39:36.500 --> 39:38.580
[FEMALE OFFICER] COME WITH ME.
[MALE OFFICER]
WATCH YOUR STEP THERE.

39:41.580 --> 39:43.590
&lt;SIGHS&gt;

39:43.630 --> 39:46.130
YOU KNOW, CLYDE, WE NEVER
DID FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR $100,000 AFTER...

39:48.300 --> 39:50.010
THAT FREAKING KID.

39:50.050 --> 39:51.470
BUZZING UP AND DOWN
THIS ROAD,

39:51.510 --> 39:53.100
DELIVERING HIS PAPER
ON THAT BIKE.

39:55.430 --> 39:57.270
WELL, THAT ONE
LOOKS LIKE A...

39:57.310 --> 39:59.940
LIKE A BRAND NEW
DIRT BIKE.

39:59.980 --> 40:02.610
-COME ON, JAKE.
-WHERE'RE WE GOING?

40:02.650 --> 40:04.570
-JAIL.
-I'LL SEE YOU LATER, DAD.

40:04.610 --> 40:07.110
-YEAH.
-GOOD LUCK, CLYDE.

40:07.150 --> 40:08.280
THANKS, JAKE.

40:10.360 --> 40:11.570
WATCH THIS.

40:14.620 --> 40:15.990
HEY!

40:19.500 --> 40:21.290
NICE BIKE YOU GOT THERE.

40:21.330 --> 40:22.790
WHAT DO YOU WANT
WITH MY SON?

40:22.830 --> 40:24.750
YEAH, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

40:24.790 --> 40:27.210
DID YOU GET YOUR NEWSPAPER
THE DAY YOUR 100 G'S
WENT MISSING?

40:27.250 --> 40:29.170
NO, BUT I'M NOT
FOLLOWING YOU.

40:29.220 --> 40:30.670
SO THERE'S A CHANCE
YOUR WIFE WASN'T
THE ONLY ONE

40:30.720 --> 40:32.840
WHO SAW YOU PASSED OUT
IN FRONT OF YOUR CAR
THAT DAY?

40:32.890 --> 40:34.220
OH.

40:35.720 --> 40:36.930
YOU LITTLE SHAGGER.

40:36.970 --> 40:38.600
&lt;SIREN WAILING&gt;

40:38.640 --> 40:40.480
YOU STOLE MY MONEY,
DIDN'T YOU?

40:40.520 --> 40:42.440
MY GUESS IS WHEN YOU
FELL ASLEEP, CLYDE,

40:42.480 --> 40:43.940
THE KID WAS GRABBING HIS
PAPERS FOR THE NEXT DAY

40:43.980 --> 40:45.520
AND FOUND THE BRIEFCASE
FULL OF CASH.

40:45.560 --> 40:47.570
-&lt;GROANS&gt;
-HERE WE ARE.

40:47.610 --> 40:49.490
-WHERE'S MY MONEY?
-YOU TOLD ME
YOU WON THAT MONEY

40:49.530 --> 40:51.360
ON SCRATCH TICKETS
AT THE STORE.

40:51.400 --> 40:53.490
WHERE'S MY MONEY AND HOW
MUCH DO YOU HAVE LEFT?

40:57.910 --> 40:58.910
&lt;LAUGHS&gt;

41:04.880 --> 41:06.170
[CHANDRA] TINNY STABBED YOU?

41:06.210 --> 41:09.380
WELL, NOT PHYSICALLY, BUT
SHE INSTRUCTED SOMEONE TO.

41:09.420 --> 41:10.880
WELL, I'M GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.

41:10.920 --> 41:13.630
AND IF YOU WANT I CAN
PRESCRIBE SOME MEDICATION.

41:13.680 --> 41:15.470
OH, THAT'D BE
GREAT ACTUALLY,

41:15.510 --> 41:16.720
BUT CAN YOU MAKE SURE
THERE'S NO STEROIDS IN IT,

41:16.760 --> 41:17.810
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO
GET ANY BIGGER?

41:18.850 --> 41:21.060
NOT THAT KIND
OF MEDICATION.

41:21.100 --> 41:22.940
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.
ACTUALLY, UM...

41:23.690 --> 41:25.060
UM, ABOUT THAT.

41:26.810 --> 41:28.690
WHAT'S GOING ON, DES?

41:28.730 --> 41:30.610
THIS IS ABOUT TINNY, ISN'T IT?

41:30.650 --> 41:32.650
UH, NO. TINNY? NO. WE'RE...

41:33.450 --> 41:34.820
-WE'RE FRIENDS.
-REALLY?

41:35.660 --> 41:37.660
YEAH. OKAY. OKAY.

41:37.700 --> 41:40.120
THIS IS, UM, THIS IS ABOUT US.

41:40.160 --> 41:41.450
I THINK...

41:42.710 --> 41:44.080
YOU'RE REALLY PRETTY.

41:44.750 --> 41:47.290
I THINK YOU'RE REALLY FUNNY.

41:47.330 --> 41:50.630
I THINK YOU'RE REALLY SMART.
I THINK YOU'RE FUN.

41:50.670 --> 41:51.840
JUST SAY IT, DES.

41:51.880 --> 41:54.340
I DON'T THINK I'M READY TO BE
IN THIS RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU.

41:57.800 --> 42:00.680
FINE. FINE.

42:00.720 --> 42:02.390
YOU TAKE
CARE OF YOURSELF, DES.

42:07.900 --> 42:09.900
[WALTER] I THINK THIS IS
THE REAL TROUBLE, PAL.

42:09.940 --> 42:12.280
I DON'T KNOW HOW
I'M GOING TO GET YOU
OUT OF THIS.

42:12.320 --> 42:14.610
ALL FOR THAT MOPE,
CLYDE COWLEY.

42:14.650 --> 42:16.360
TALK ABOUT YOUR BAD LUCK.

42:16.410 --> 42:18.490
HEY, HOW DID IT
GO WITH JESSICA?

42:18.530 --> 42:20.240
SHE LOST INTEREST
PRETTY QUICKLY.

42:20.280 --> 42:23.160
-AH. SORRY, BUDDY.
-WE MADE OUT.

42:24.160 --> 42:25.910
FELT HER BOOB A BIT.

42:25.960 --> 42:29.750
YOU KNOW, THAT WAS MY
EXACT FANTASY ABOUT HER
IN HIGH SCHOOL.

42:35.550 --> 42:37.510
JAKE, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL YOU.

42:37.550 --> 42:39.300
YOU'RE CAUGHT ON TAPE
ROBBING A BANK,

42:39.350 --> 42:40.970
MISLEADING POLICE,
EVADING POLICE,

42:41.010 --> 42:44.980
POSSESSION OF A FIREARM,
AND DON'T EVEN GET ME
STARTED ON CHILI POWER.

42:45.020 --> 42:48.310
WELL, WHEN YOU STACK
THE THINGS ALL UP AGAINST
EACH OTHER LIKE THAT,

42:48.350 --> 42:49.650
IT DOES LOOK KIND OF...

42:50.940 --> 42:52.150
YEAH.

42:52.190 --> 42:53.320
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO TELL ME HERE?

42:53.360 --> 42:54.820
I WOULD ADVISE YOU NOT TO.

42:56.780 --> 42:59.240
THAT'S A NICE OUTFIT.

42:59.280 --> 43:02.740
LOOK, SOMETHING TELLS ME,
HAVING WATCHED THE TAPES
OF THE BANK ROBBERY,

43:02.790 --> 43:04.700
THAT YOU WEREN'T THERE
TO STEAL ANYTHING.

43:04.750 --> 43:06.830
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY
WIGGLE ROOM TO GET ME OUT.

43:07.410 --> 43:09.040
I'M SORRY.

43:09.080 --> 43:11.590
I TOLD YOU YOUR CRAP WAS
GOING TO GET YOU IN TROUBLE,

43:11.630 --> 43:12.710
AND NOW IT HAS.

43:17.760 --> 43:20.720
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GOING TO
BE BUNKING IN HER MAJESTY'S
PEN FOR SOME TIME.
