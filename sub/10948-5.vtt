Oh, I see. So there's time to get
your scrolls, and time to get your staff,

but no time for my boomerang?

02:17.180 --> 02:19.020
- That's correct.
- Oh...

02:23.980 --> 02:25.980
Sorry about your boomerang, Sokka.

02:26.280 --> 02:28.610
I feel like I've lost part of my identity.

03:21.370 --> 03:23.210
it's just nice to be appreciated.

And it's nice to appreciate
their deep-fried festival food.

03:28.170 --> 03:30.670
That's the biggest me I've ever seen.

03:37.560 --> 03:39.890

05:11.730 --> 05:13.610
I suggest you leave.

05:13.740 --> 05:15.650
You're not welcome here, Avatar.

05:15.780 --> 05:18.410
Why not? Aang helps people.

05:18.530 --> 05:20.910
It's true. I'm on your side.

05:21.120 --> 05:23.330
I find that hard to swallow,

05:23.410 --> 05:26.330
considering what you did to us
in your past life!

05:26.710 --> 05:28.670
It was Avatar Kyoshi.

05:28.790 --> 05:31.880
She murdered our glorious leader,
Chin the Great.

05:32.340 --> 05:33.590
You think that I...

05:33.760 --> 05:35.220
Murdered someone?

05:35.340 --> 05:38.380
We used to be a great society
before you killed our leader.

05:38.510 --> 05:39.760
Now look at us!

05:40.140 --> 05:42.890
- Ah!
- Aang would never do something like that.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.600
No Avatar would.

05:44.720 --> 05:47.270
And it's not fair for you all
to question his honor!

05:47.600 --> 05:50.560
Let's tell her what we think
of the Avatar's honor!

05:54.980 --> 05:57.570
AANG: Give me a chance to clear my name.

05:57.950 --> 06:02.200
The only way to prove your innocence
is to stand trial.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.620
I'll gladly stand trial.

06:04.740 --> 06:07.000
You'll have to follow all our rules.

06:07.120 --> 06:09.790
That includes paying bail.

06:10.080 --> 06:11.330
No problem.

06:12.460 --> 06:15.710
How was I supposed to know
they wouldn't take Water Tribe money?

06:22.430 --> 06:24.810
So some people don't like you, big deal.

06:24.890 --> 06:27.520
There's a whole nation
of firebenders who hate you.

06:27.600 --> 06:30.310
- Now let's bust you out of here.
- I can't.

06:30.690 --> 06:33.190
Sure you can! A little... ( BLOWS )

06:35.860 --> 06:37.070
And we're on our way.

06:37.320 --> 06:40.030
KATARA: I think what Master Swish
Is trying to say,

06:40.150 --> 06:42.620
is that you're supposed
to be out saving the world.

06:42.700 --> 06:44.580
You can't do that locked up in here.

06:45.080 --> 06:48.000
I can't do that with people thinking
I'm a murderer, either.

06:48.080 --> 06:50.420
I need you guys to help
prove my innocence.

06:50.790 --> 06:54.130
How are we gonna do that?
The crime happened over 300 years ago.

06:54.540 --> 06:55.750
That's okay, Sokka.

06:55.840 --> 06:57.510
For some reason, I thought you were

06:57.630 --> 06:59.220
an expert detective.

06:59.720 --> 07:03.300
Well, I guess I could
be classified as such.

07:03.430 --> 07:06.140
Yeah! Back home, he was famous for

07:06.220 --> 07:09.180
solving the mystery
of the missing seal jerky.

07:09.350 --> 07:11.690
Everyone wanted
to blame it on the polar leopard,

07:11.770 --> 07:13.610
but I figured out it was old man Jarco

07:13.690 --> 07:15.610
wearing polar leopard boots.

07:15.730 --> 07:19.240
See, a real 800 pound polar leopard
would've left much deeper tracks.

07:19.360 --> 07:21.610
Okay, I guess I am pretty good.

07:22.280 --> 07:23.870
So you'll help me with my case?

07:24.820 --> 07:27.620
Fine. But I'm gonna need some new props.

07:28.620 --> 07:30.330
I'm ready.

MAYOR: This is the crime scene.

08:10.410 --> 08:14.000
This is the footprint of the killer,
Kyoshi.

08:14.120 --> 08:19.550
It was at sunset, 370 years ago today,

08:19.670 --> 08:24.050
that she emerged from the temple
and struck down Chin the Great.

08:24.760 --> 08:26.640
After that tragic day,

08:26.760 --> 08:28.010
we built this statue

08:28.140 --> 08:30.810
to immortalize our great leader.

08:31.310 --> 08:33.480
Feel free to appreciate it.

08:41.940 --> 08:45.150
This temple and this statue
were cut from the same stone.

08:45.860 --> 08:49.080
And we know that the statue
was built after Chin died.

08:49.580 --> 08:52.200
So, if they were built at the same time,
that means―

08:52.290 --> 08:54.250
Shh! I wanna solve it!

08:54.500 --> 08:58.250
That means
Kyoshi never set foot in this temple.

08:58.330 --> 09:00.630
KATARA: That's a big hole
in the mayor's story,

09:00.710 --> 09:03.210
but it's not enough
to prove Aang's innocence.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.300
You're right.

09:08.140 --> 09:10.640
We need to go to Kyoshi island.

Oyaji, Aang is in jail.

The town of Chin says he murdered
their leader in a past life.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.250
They say it was Kyoshi.

10:25.380 --> 10:27.760
Kyoshi? That's crazy talk.

10:27.880 --> 10:29.220
I'll take you to her shrine.

10:29.340 --> 10:32.510
Maybe something there
will help you clear her name.

10:34.930 --> 10:37.390
So, uh... What's Suki up to?

10:37.520 --> 10:39.100
Is she around?

10:39.230 --> 10:42.770
Actually, she and the other warriors
left to fight in the war.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.230
You kids had a big impact on Suki.

10:45.360 --> 10:47.190
She said you inspired her,

10:47.320 --> 10:49.780
and she wanted to help change the world.

10:50.110 --> 10:52.620
Oh, well... That's great.

10:54.620 --> 10:58.500
OYAJI: This temple was converted
into a shrine to Kyoshi.

10:58.620 --> 11:00.790
The clerics tell us these relics

11:00.920 --> 11:03.380
are still connected to her spirit.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.090
That's her kimono.

11:05.210 --> 11:07.880
- She had exquisite taste.
- Please don't touch!

11:08.010 --> 11:09.590
SOKKA: These fans,

11:09.720 --> 11:11.340
they were her weapons, no?

11:11.470 --> 11:14.680
Also refrain from touching the fans.

11:14.800 --> 11:18.020
These were her boots?
Her feet must have been enormous.

11:33.910 --> 11:36.740
You're right. I'm sorry. Please.

11:37.330 --> 11:38.330
Aha!

11:38.450 --> 11:41.500
There's no way Kyoshi could have
made that footprint.

11:41.620 --> 11:45.290
And therefore, there is nothing
linking her to the crime scene.

11:45.420 --> 11:47.000
Brilliant, Sokka.

11:51.220 --> 11:53.840
This girl you're talking about,
she'll come around.

- Sure.
- Yeah.

It was painted at sunrise
on the day this island was founded.

12:22.330 --> 12:26.960
Why, it was today, in fact, 370 years ago.

12:29.380 --> 12:31.380
Wait, are you sure it was today?

12:31.510 --> 12:33.470
Well, seeing how it's Kyoshi day,

12:33.590 --> 12:35.590
yes, I'm sure.

12:36.470 --> 12:40.850
This ceremony didn't take place
at sunrise, it took place at sunset.

12:40.970 --> 12:42.560
Look at the shadows.

12:42.680 --> 12:45.980
They point east,
so the sun must have been in the west.

12:46.100 --> 12:48.270
- So what?
- Aah!

12:48.360 --> 12:50.270
If Kyoshi was in the ceremony at sunset,

12:50.360 --> 12:52.940
she couldn't have been in Chin
committing the crime.

12:53.530 --> 12:55.450
She has an alibi.

12:55.530 --> 12:56.860
Oh, uh!

12:57.620 --> 13:00.240
Honorable mayor,
we've prepared a solid defense

13:00.330 --> 13:01.330
for the Avatar.

13:01.410 --> 13:02.620
We did an investigation,

13:02.750 --> 13:04.710
and found some very strong evidence.

13:05.210 --> 13:06.960
MAYOR: Evidence? Ha!

13:07.080 --> 13:09.340
That's not how our court system works.

13:09.630 --> 13:11.590
Then how can I prove my innocence?

13:11.710 --> 13:15.300
Simple. I say what happened,
and then you say what happened,

13:15.380 --> 13:18.340
and then I decide who's right.

13:18.470 --> 13:19.550
-( GASPS )
-( GASPS )

13:19.890 --> 13:23.520
That's why we call it justice,
because it's just us.

13:23.930 --> 13:25.770
( LAUGHING )

13:32.610 --> 13:34.400
Everyone loved Chin the Great,

13:34.530 --> 13:36.320
because he was so great.

13:36.530 --> 13:39.490
Then the Avatar showed up and killed him,

13:39.700 --> 13:41.870
and that's how it happened.

13:42.080 --> 13:46.330
The accused will now present its argument.

13:47.710 --> 13:50.170
You can do it, Aang.
Just remember the evidence.

13:50.290 --> 13:53.420
Right... Evidence.

13:53.550 --> 13:55.090
Ladies and gentlemen,

13:55.210 --> 13:57.630
I'm about to tell you
what really happened,

13:57.760 --> 14:00.430
and I will prove it with facts.

14:00.550 --> 14:02.350
Fact number one:

14:03.390 --> 14:05.100
Uh...

14:05.220 --> 14:06.560
The footprints.

14:06.680 --> 14:07.770
Oh, yeah.

14:08.350 --> 14:11.360
You see, I have very large feet.

14:14.150 --> 14:15.440
Furthermore,

14:15.900 --> 14:19.110
your temple... Matches your statue.

14:21.200 --> 14:24.290
But I was in a painting at sunset.

14:25.290 --> 14:26.370
So there you have it.

14:26.450 --> 14:27.960
I'm not guilty!

14:29.750 --> 14:31.040
He's dead.

14:33.210 --> 14:36.130
Looks like you did some serious shopping.

14:37.050 --> 14:38.590
But where did you get the money?

14:38.720 --> 14:40.630
Do you like your new teapot?

14:40.970 --> 14:44.310
To be honest with you,
the best tea tastes delicious

14:44.430 --> 14:46.720
whether it comes in a porcelain pot,

14:46.850 --> 14:48.480
or a tin cup.

14:49.020 --> 14:52.270
I know we've had
some difficult times lately.

14:52.400 --> 14:56.030
We've had to struggle just to get by.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.490
But it's nothing to be ashamed of.

14:58.610 --> 15:01.950
There is a simple honor in poverty.

15:02.070 --> 15:04.740
There's no honor for me
without the Avatar.

15:04.870 --> 15:05.910
Zuko...

15:07.580 --> 15:10.540
Even if you did capture the Avatar,

15:10.620 --> 15:13.880
I'm not so sure
it would solve our problems.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.340
Not now.

15:15.460 --> 15:17.050
Then there is no hope at all.

15:17.170 --> 15:18.840
No, Zuko!

15:18.960 --> 15:21.180
You must never give in to despair.

15:21.300 --> 15:23.890
Allow yourself to slip down that road

15:23.970 --> 15:26.720
and you surrender
to your lowest instincts.

15:28.140 --> 15:30.020
In the darkest times,

15:30.140 --> 15:33.400
hope is something you give yourself.

15:33.520 --> 15:36.980
That is the meaning of inner strength.

15:46.580 --> 15:48.040
KATARA: Mayor Tong.

15:48.490 --> 15:51.000
I'd like for the court
to hear one last testimony.

15:51.460 --> 15:55.000
I've already told you!
It's just me and the accused.

15:55.130 --> 15:57.500
You can't call any witnesses.

15:57.630 --> 15:59.710
This isn't just any witness.

15:59.840 --> 16:01.550
I'm going to call...

16:01.670 --> 16:04.010
Avatar Kyoshi herself!

16:04.140 --> 16:05.850
CROWD: ( MURMURING )

16:05.970 --> 16:07.350
Are they serious?

16:07.430 --> 16:08.560
MAN: That's impossible.

16:13.560 --> 16:14.730
What are you doing?

16:14.850 --> 16:17.060
Well, she is Aang's past life.

16:17.190 --> 16:19.940
Maybe wearing her stuff
will trigger something.

16:20.070 --> 16:23.240
I do believe in the power of stuff...

16:24.030 --> 16:25.530
This is a mockery of Chin law!

16:26.120 --> 16:28.370
Please, if you could
just wait one more second!

16:28.490 --> 16:30.700
I'm sure Kyoshi will be here.

16:33.410 --> 16:36.630
( SPEAKING IN HIGH VOICE )
Hey, everybody. Avatar Kyoshi here.

16:36.880 --> 16:39.340
This is ridiculous.

16:39.550 --> 16:42.050
For the murder of Chin the Great,

16:42.260 --> 16:44.630
this court finds the Avatar...

16:55.310 --> 16:57.440
I killed Chin the Conqueror...

16:59.570 --> 17:01.280
<i>A horrible tyrant.</i>

17:01.400 --> 17:02.940
<i>Chin was expanding his army</i>

17:03.070 --> 17:05.240
<i>to all corners of the continent.</i>

17:05.910 --> 17:08.950
<i>When they came to the neck
of the peninsula where we lived,</i>

17:09.030 --> 17:11.080
<i>he demanded our immediate surrender.</i>

17:11.790 --> 17:15.790
<i>I warned him that I would not
sit passively while he took our home.</i>

17:16.370 --> 17:18.250
<i>But he did not back down.</i>

17:25.970 --> 17:29.510
<i>On that day, we split from the mainland.</i>

17:31.890 --> 17:36.560
( RUMBLING )

18:03.840 --> 18:05.710

Aah!

18:12.140 --> 18:13.850
KYOSHI: I <i>created Kyoshi island</i>

18:13.970 --> 18:16.600
so my people could be safe from invaders.

18:24.780 --> 18:25.860
Oh...

18:27.030 --> 18:29.950
So... What just happened?

18:30.070 --> 18:33.160
Uh... You kind of confessed.

18:33.280 --> 18:34.700
Sorry.

18:34.830 --> 18:37.620
And I find you guilty!

18:38.410 --> 18:40.960
Bring out the Wheel of Punishment!

Uncle...

18:49.590 --> 18:51.340
I thought a lot about what you said.

18:51.680 --> 18:53.800
You did? Good, good.

18:53.890 --> 18:55.470
It's helped me realize something.

18:55.600 --> 18:58.640
We no longer have anything to gain
by traveling together.

19:00.100 --> 19:01.690
I need to find my own way.

Spin the Wheel of Punishment

19:29.090 --> 19:31.300
to determine his sentence.

19:33.720 --> 19:35.550
I said I would face justice,

19:35.680 --> 19:36.680
so I will.

19:42.440 --> 19:44.270
Come on torture machine!

Now show me your leader, so I may...

Dethrone him.

-( YELPS )

20:25.230 --> 20:27.270

20:29.780 --> 20:32.070

May we eat it and be reminded
