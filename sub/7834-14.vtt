01:05.230 --> 01:07.165
D'oh!

01:27.754 --> 01:30.655
<i>Welcome back to</i>
Great Moments in Olympic History.

01:30.757 --> 01:35.023
<i>At the 1936 Berlin Games,</i>
<i>Jesse Owens humiliates Adolph Hitler...</i>

01:35.128 --> 01:37.153
<i>by outracing his zeppelin.</i>

01:41.634 --> 01:43.431
<i>1968, Mexico City.</i>

01:43.536 --> 01:46.403
<i>Bob Beamon shatters</i>
<i>the world long jump record.</i>

01:48.508 --> 01:50.408
<i>Ow!</i>

01:53.313 --> 01:56.339
<i>And in 1984,</i>
<i>Portugal's Carlos Lopez...</i>

01:56.449 --> 01:58.940
<i>becomes the oldest Olympic</i>
<i>marathon winner ever...</i>

01:59.052 --> 02:00.883
<i>at age 38.</i>

02:00.987 --> 02:04.616
Thirty-eight!
That's roughly my age.

02:04.724 --> 02:06.988
Marge, after a lot of thought...

02:07.093 --> 02:10.425
I've decided to run
the Springfield Marathon.

02:10.530 --> 02:15.558
Oh, please. You get exhausted
watching <i>The Twilight Zone</i> marathon.

02:15.668 --> 02:18.603
I'm a regular Billy Crystal.

02:18.705 --> 02:22.106
- You got that right.
- Well, Dad, I think running's good exercise.

02:22.208 --> 02:25.575
- It adds years to your life.
- Stay out of this, Lisa.

02:25.678 --> 02:29.910
Marge, I've made up my mind.
I'll do your job for a day, and you do mine.

02:30.016 --> 02:32.314
Then we'll see who has it tougher.

02:38.224 --> 02:42.285
<i>Good afternoon. And welcome</i>
<i>to the 97th Springfield Marathon...</i>

02:42.395 --> 02:44.454
commemorating the time
Jebediah Springfield...

02:44.564 --> 02:47.431
ran across six states
to avoid his creditors.

02:47.534 --> 02:49.525
You got all your equipment, Dad?

02:49.636 --> 02:51.763
Let's see. Sweatbands, check.

02:51.871 --> 02:55.329
Anti-chafing nipple tape, check, check, and check.

02:55.441 --> 02:58.899
Attention, runners.
On your mark, get set...

02:59.012 --> 03:02.106
now get outta here
before I change my mind.

03:04.284 --> 03:08.152
I can't believe it.
I'm actually running a marathon!

03:08.254 --> 03:12.190
I hit the wall! This is so painful.

03:12.292 --> 03:14.886
Hey, I got my second wind!

03:14.994 --> 03:17.656
Another wall! I just-
Whoo-hoo! Third wind.

03:19.132 --> 03:20.963
- Faster, rickshaw driver! Faster!
- Ow!

03:21.067 --> 03:23.729
- Sir, the whip isn't helping.
- Silence!

03:23.836 --> 03:26.066
You call yourself Chinese?

03:26.172 --> 03:30.108
No one can outrun The Flash!

03:30.210 --> 03:33.805
Curses! One of my super foes
has set a trap for me.

03:35.081 --> 03:39.211
Hey, Grampa's running!

03:39.319 --> 03:42.049
That's not Grampa.
Dad's just dehydrated.

03:54.867 --> 03:56.334
<i>And with 500 yards to go...</i>

03:56.436 --> 03:58.404
<i>the runners from Australia</i>
<i>and Djibouti are neck and neck.</i>

03:58.504 --> 04:00.472
<i>Two weary warriors now burning</i>
<i>with pain and exhaustion.</i>

04:00.573 --> 04:02.473
But only one will win
the grand prize:

04:02.575 --> 04:04.543
A walking tour of Springfield.

04:05.979 --> 04:07.446
That tour is mine.

04:07.547 --> 04:10.414
Well, hold the phone, Dora.

04:10.516 --> 04:12.848
<i>A new challenger has emerged</i>
<i>out of nowhere.</i>

04:12.952 --> 04:15.113
<i>He's running on sheer pluck,</i>
<i>moxie and grit.</i>

04:15.221 --> 04:17.245
All of which he'll be
tested for after the race.

04:17.357 --> 04:22.317
Hey, I "winna" the race! <i>Viva Italia!</i>

04:22.428 --> 04:24.623
Folks, our winner seems
to be from Italy.

04:24.731 --> 04:26.995
I love-a you all.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.933
I use up all of my English.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.339
<i>Grazie,</i> Springfield!

04:37.510 --> 04:39.705
- He's a phony!
- Lousy cheater!

04:39.812 --> 04:42.280
I demand a re-race!

04:42.382 --> 04:46.182
I got a better idea.
Let's have a fun run... on his trachea.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.844
- Yeah!
- Kill him!

04:47.954 --> 04:51.583
Make him pay!

04:55.328 --> 04:58.786
- Get in. Hurry!
- <i>Mob, stranger. Mob, stranger.</i>

04:58.898 --> 05:01.162
Stranger!

05:04.170 --> 05:07.765
- Who are you?
- Oh, you'll find out in due time.

05:07.874 --> 05:09.842
Well, it says here
your name is L.T. Smash.

05:09.942 --> 05:12.206
The time has come.
I'm L.T. Smash.

05:18.751 --> 05:21.720
Thank you so much for saving
our son from that murderous mob.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.914
Well, thank you for letting me
chill in your crib.

05:24.057 --> 05:26.423
And thank you
for assuming we're hip.

05:26.526 --> 05:29.086
All right, now here's the 411.
I'm a record producer, see?

05:29.195 --> 05:32.722
I'm starting a new boy band.
And there's a place in it for Bart.

05:32.832 --> 05:34.766
- My Bart?
- Oh, yeah.

05:34.867 --> 05:38.894
That stunt he pulled at the race shows me
he's the bad boy I'm looking for.

05:39.005 --> 05:41.439
Now listen to me, Smash.

05:41.541 --> 05:45.307
We're not signing anything
unless it's a contract.

05:45.411 --> 05:48.437
Why do you want Bart?
He's not much of a singer.

05:48.548 --> 05:51.984
Marge, it's not the singing
that brings in the Sacagaweas.

05:52.085 --> 05:56.613
Bart's a rebel. And that's what I need
for my new band, the Party Posse.

05:56.723 --> 06:00.181
Now hold on.
I have some concerns.

06:00.293 --> 06:03.490
Please, Mom.
My dream is to be a rock star!

06:03.596 --> 06:06.292
- And my dream is to get rid of Bart.
- But-

06:06.399 --> 06:10.062
- How many lives must you ruin?
- Oh, okay.

06:16.476 --> 06:20.071
Bart, I want you to meet and greet
the other members of the Party Posse.

06:20.179 --> 06:22.079
He's smart, he's soulful...

06:22.181 --> 06:25.207
- <i>he's Milhouse.</i>
- What up, "G" Money?

06:25.318 --> 06:28.549
Next, he'll break your nose,
your glasses <i>and</i> your heart.

06:28.654 --> 06:31.782
- <i>Nelson.</i>
- Wait. These are just guys from school.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.825
Who's next? Ralph Wiggum?

06:33.926 --> 06:37.123
Whee! I'm a pop sensation.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.755
And I'm the mack daddy
behind such groups as...

06:39.866 --> 06:42.630
New Kids in the Ditch
and Boy-nudo.

06:42.735 --> 06:44.669
I'm gonna make you stars.

06:44.771 --> 06:49.538
Sneer, sneer. Two, three, four, and thrust.

06:49.642 --> 06:53.976
And grab yourself right there.
Now let's go and flirt.

06:54.080 --> 06:58.141
You call that a flirt? I'm not melting!

06:58.251 --> 07:02.312
Okay. 'Tudes are fly
and your threads are dope.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.356
All that's left is the singing.

07:04.457 --> 07:06.721
"Party Posse,
we rule the earth.

07:06.826 --> 07:09.317
The greatest band
since music's birth"?

07:09.429 --> 07:11.397
Isn't this song a little boastful?

07:11.497 --> 07:13.795
No one told me there
was gonna be boasting.

07:13.900 --> 07:16.460
- Just take it from the top.
- # Party Posse #

07:16.569 --> 07:18.469
#We rule the earth #

07:18.571 --> 07:21.131
#The greatest band
since music's birth ##

07:21.240 --> 07:23.003
Ew!

07:23.109 --> 07:25.168
Thank you, NASA.

07:27.547 --> 07:31.643
#We love to sweat and we love to sing #

07:31.751 --> 07:35.847
#We're real funky
but not threatening #

07:35.955 --> 07:39.220
#We're the best band
in the world #

07:39.325 --> 07:42.920
# But we'd give it all up
for that special girl #

07:43.029 --> 07:44.963
#You're my special girl #

07:45.064 --> 07:50.024
# Special girl #

07:50.136 --> 07:52.696
<i># You're my special girl #</i>

07:52.805 --> 07:56.832
<i># Only you ##</i>

07:59.812 --> 08:01.780
So from now on, anything
caught in your zipper...

08:01.881 --> 08:04.543
will be handled
by the school nurse and not me.

08:04.650 --> 08:08.916
And now, are you adequately
prepared to rock?

08:11.190 --> 08:13.522
Silence!

08:13.626 --> 08:16.356
Here they are, the Party Posse!

08:19.365 --> 08:22.391
Hello, Springfield!

08:22.502 --> 08:26.131
Now here's a song that your
Principal Skinner doesn't want us to play.

08:26.239 --> 08:28.070
Boo!

08:28.174 --> 08:30.870
That's not true.
This assembly was my idea.

08:30.977 --> 08:33.241
I like your brand
of inoffensive pop rock.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.042
Screw you, man!
We're gonna play it anyway.

08:36.148 --> 08:38.809
Hmph!

08:42.255 --> 08:44.314
# I saw you last night #

08:44.423 --> 08:48.154
#At the spelling bee #

08:48.261 --> 08:50.320
# I knew right then #

08:50.429 --> 08:53.830
#That it was L-U-V#

08:53.933 --> 08:56.766
# I gotta spell out #

08:56.869 --> 09:01.238
#What you mean to me #

09:01.340 --> 09:07.643
# 'Cause I can no longer be #

09:08.848 --> 09:11.646
#A silent "G" #

09:11.751 --> 09:14.720
- <i># I've gotta spell out #
- # I've gotta spell out #</i>

09:14.820 --> 09:18.187
# I've gotta spell out
what you mean to me #

09:18.291 --> 09:20.816
Man, they're gonna be big.

09:20.927 --> 09:22.861
And you stood in their way.

09:22.962 --> 09:26.523
No, I didn't. I even came in early
and made orange drink.

09:26.632 --> 09:29.362
Orange drink? What?
Do you live with your mama?

09:29.468 --> 09:31.936
She lives with me.

09:32.038 --> 09:34.438
#A silent G ##

09:36.542 --> 09:38.305
I can't believe it.
They loved us!

09:38.411 --> 09:41.403
I'm wearing a bathrobe
and I'm not even sick.

09:41.514 --> 09:44.608
<i>Yo, dudes, awesome show!</i>

09:44.717 --> 09:46.912
It's N'Sync!

09:52.325 --> 09:54.987
- Word!
- What brings you to Springfield?

09:55.094 --> 09:57.119
We saw your band formation
notice in the paper.

09:57.229 --> 09:59.094
Really?
You saw our B.F. N?

09:59.198 --> 10:02.531
I can't believe
I'm meeting Milhouse. Word!

10:02.635 --> 10:06.127
So anyway, we brought you
this wicked gift basket.

10:06.238 --> 10:09.366
- Stubble glitter, a crowd Taser.
- Crowd Taser?

10:09.475 --> 10:12.911
Yeah. It's perfect for getting
through the fans to your limousine.

10:13.012 --> 10:14.912
Ow! Yo!

10:15.014 --> 10:18.575
Dudes, we gotta go.
Our clothes are getting a little out-of-date.

10:18.684 --> 10:21.551
- To the Bandana Republic!
- Word!

10:26.492 --> 10:28.858
Now we gotta send them a basket.

10:30.262 --> 10:32.321
<i>Oh, yeah. That's the spot.</i>

10:32.431 --> 10:35.264
That is perfect.

10:35.368 --> 10:38.860
Mom, can't Bart get his massage
somewhere else?

10:38.971 --> 10:40.700
Don't be selfish, Lisa.

10:40.806 --> 10:44.367
Will you two shut up?
I'm missing precious V.J. Prattle!

10:44.477 --> 10:49.073
Whoo! That was the latest ad
for Stridex Pads, medicated.

10:49.181 --> 10:54.175
Okay, coming at ya,
a world premiere video from "P" Squared.

10:54.286 --> 10:57.187
That's the Party Posse!

10:57.289 --> 11:00.816
Whoo! Yeah! All right!

11:02.595 --> 11:05.496
Rock! Whoo!

11:05.598 --> 11:09.159
<i>#Oh, say can you rock #</i>

11:11.404 --> 11:15.306
#There's trouble in a far-off nation #

11:15.408 --> 11:19.469
#Time to get in love formation #

11:19.578 --> 11:23.639
#Your love's more deadly than Saddam #

11:23.749 --> 11:27.845
#And that's why
I gotta drop da bomb #

11:32.625 --> 11:35.185
Party Posse!

11:47.707 --> 11:51.609
#Yvan eht nioj
Eht nioj #

11:51.711 --> 11:55.010
#Yvan eht nioj #

11:55.114 --> 11:57.082
You gotta love that crazy chorus.

11:57.183 --> 11:59.583
- What does it mean?
- It doesn't mean anything.

11:59.685 --> 12:02.711
It's like "rama lama ding dong"
or "give peace a chance."

12:05.991 --> 12:09.222
#This party's happenin' #

12:10.763 --> 12:13.061
# It's no mirage #

12:13.165 --> 12:15.895
# So sing it again #

12:16.001 --> 12:18.526
#Yvan eht nioj #

12:18.637 --> 12:21.128
<i>#Yvan eht nioj #</i>

12:31.250 --> 12:35.346
<i>There's something weird about this video.</i>

12:35.454 --> 12:38.981
None of those girls has had three kids,
I can tell you that.

12:39.091 --> 12:40.718
No. Something else.

12:52.271 --> 12:55.536
<i>"Yvan eht nioj. '" They keep saying that.</i>

12:55.641 --> 12:57.939
Wait. What was that?

13:00.713 --> 13:03.944
<i>Uncle Sam?</i>
<i>Let me play this backwards.</i>

13:05.050 --> 13:09.680
#Join the navy #

13:09.789 --> 13:11.984
Join the navy.

13:12.091 --> 13:15.219
They're recruiting people
with subliminal messages.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.658
Otto, what are you doing?

13:19.765 --> 13:22.859
I don't know. I just got
an urge to join the navy.

13:22.968 --> 13:25.095
You're being brainwashed!

13:25.204 --> 13:28.833
Yeah, probably.
"Yvan eht nioj."

13:34.713 --> 13:37.181
L.T., thank God you're here!

13:37.283 --> 13:40.650
The government's putting
subliminal messages in your videos!

13:40.753 --> 13:42.653
Subliminal messages?

13:42.755 --> 13:46.054
Do you have any idea
how insane that sounds?

13:46.158 --> 13:49.389
- Is that a navy tattoo?
- A navy tattoo?

13:49.495 --> 13:52.464
Do you have any idea
how insane that sounds?

14:00.306 --> 14:02.297
Lieutenant Smash!

14:02.408 --> 14:06.674
Yeah, that's right.
Lieutenant L.T. Smash.

14:08.681 --> 14:12.048
A wig! But-
But your pant legs.

14:14.787 --> 14:20.054
How could you soil
the good name of Star Blitzzz Promotions?

14:20.159 --> 14:23.788
Oh, come on, Lisa. We've always
used pop stars to recruit people.

14:23.896 --> 14:27.696
Going back to Elvis.
Then there was <i>Sgt. Pepper's...</i>

14:27.800 --> 14:31.201
the Captain & Tennille,
and the Kiss army.

14:31.303 --> 14:33.294
But you have recruiting ads on TV.

14:33.405 --> 14:35.430
Why do you need
subliminal messages?

14:35.541 --> 14:37.441
It's a three-pronged attack.

14:37.543 --> 14:40.068
Subliminal, liminal,
and super liminal.

14:40.179 --> 14:42.739
- Super liminal?
- I'll show you.

14:42.848 --> 14:44.907
Hey, you! Join the navy!

14:45.017 --> 14:47.144
- Uh, yeah, all right.
- I'm in.

14:47.253 --> 14:49.187
Well, now that you know, Lisa...

14:49.288 --> 14:52.314
I'm afraid I can't let you leave.

14:52.424 --> 14:53.982
Oh.

14:55.661 --> 14:58.960
Wait a minute.
Bart's band is brainwashing kids...

14:59.064 --> 15:01.032
with subliminal messages?

15:01.133 --> 15:03.033
That's pretty far-fetched, Lisa.

15:03.135 --> 15:06.866
Are you sure someone hasn't been
bitten by the jealousy bug?

15:06.972 --> 15:09.873
Here comes the jealousy bug!

15:09.975 --> 15:12.500
- Gonna get ya! Gonna get ya!
- Hey! Stop!

15:12.611 --> 15:14.545
Cut it out.
You're a grown man.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.706
I want to go home now.

15:16.815 --> 15:18.783
Nobody's going home!

15:18.884 --> 15:20.977
We're going to see Bart's concert.

15:22.354 --> 15:25.881
<i>An aircraft carrier?</i>
<i>Oh, that's subtle.</i>

15:25.991 --> 15:29.859
Good afternoon, and welcome
to the U.S.S. <i>Sea Spanker!</i>

15:29.962 --> 15:33.295
Are you ready to tear it up?

15:33.399 --> 15:37.563
I can't hear you.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.695
Do you maggots
want to see a show or not?

15:39.805 --> 15:42.535
I mean, uh-

15:42.641 --> 15:45.201
Here they are!
The Party Posse!

15:49.782 --> 15:53.081
# Had a girl in every port #

15:53.185 --> 15:57.952
# From here to Barcelona #

15:58.057 --> 16:00.787
# But now I'm back in Springfield #

16:00.893 --> 16:05.796
#And, girl
I'm gonna phone ya #

16:05.898 --> 16:09.299
# I stormed a lot of beaches #

16:09.401 --> 16:13.462
# But you're the one that I miss #

16:13.572 --> 16:15.938
# Let's get back together, girl #

16:16.041 --> 16:18.703
# Let's reenlist #

16:18.811 --> 16:21.143
Ow! Hot, hot, hot!

16:21.246 --> 16:26.183
# So sign me up for a hitch of love #

16:26.285 --> 16:28.185
# Recruit my heart #

16:28.287 --> 16:31.518
# Four sweet years of love #

16:31.623 --> 16:34.717
Everybody ball walk!

16:34.827 --> 16:36.727
Oh, yeah!

16:40.833 --> 16:44.098
Looking good, guys.
And... double time!

16:48.807 --> 16:50.672
That's it.

16:50.776 --> 16:53.176
Protect the country.

17:02.054 --> 17:05.046
- Groovy, dude.
- Burn down the barbershops!

17:05.156 --> 17:07.250
I hate America!

17:12.598 --> 17:14.998
<i>Lieutenant! Lieutenant Smash!</i>

17:15.099 --> 17:18.228
Huh? Oh, Admiral. Hup!

17:18.337 --> 17:21.238
- The hippie fantasy again?
- They're getting less frequent, sir.

17:21.339 --> 17:23.467
Excellent.

17:23.575 --> 17:25.509
Well, there's no easy way to say this.

17:25.611 --> 17:28.637
The new administration
is shutting down Project Boy Band.

17:28.747 --> 17:32.444
Shutting it down?
Permission to say "that's crazy," sir?

17:32.551 --> 17:36.248
You won't say it's crazy when
you see next week's issue of <i>Mad</i> magazine.

17:38.157 --> 17:40.057
<i>Oh, dear God.</i>

17:40.159 --> 17:43.128
When this satirical bombshell
hits the stands tomorrow...

17:43.228 --> 17:46.288
your band will have as much recruiting power
as a wax apple.

17:46.398 --> 17:49.094
- I don't follow, sir.
- It's over, L.T.

17:53.472 --> 17:57.101
# Let's march all day
and clean latrines all night #

17:57.209 --> 17:59.905
# Don't bust me down #

18:00.012 --> 18:02.572
# Let's re-up tonight #

18:04.149 --> 18:06.913
# Let's re-up tonight ##

18:09.021 --> 18:10.989
I'm outta here.

18:12.157 --> 18:14.455
You fool!
Look what you've done!

18:14.560 --> 18:16.460
Well, now it's my turn.

18:16.562 --> 18:19.531
- Don't do it, L. T!
- You leave me no choice!

18:23.502 --> 18:25.629
No!

18:28.440 --> 18:31.307
No!

18:39.118 --> 18:42.747
So, what songs did I miss?

18:42.855 --> 18:46.256
Dad, L.T.'s gone crazy!

18:46.358 --> 18:49.225
Yeah. That's the look.

18:52.331 --> 18:54.231
Think he's gonna
do something dangerous?

18:54.333 --> 18:56.631
How should I know?
Just keep loading missiles.

18:56.735 --> 18:58.862
Pop music's hard work.

19:02.241 --> 19:05.438
The Statue of Liberty?
Where are we?

19:09.114 --> 19:11.548
All right, Posse, that's our target.

19:17.055 --> 19:19.182
Not <i>Mad!</i>

19:19.291 --> 19:23.022
That's our nation's largest mental
illness-themed humor magazine!

19:23.128 --> 19:27.997
Why don't we call it "Everybody Hates Raymond?"

19:28.100 --> 19:30.967
Well, we stayed up all night,
but it was worth it.

19:31.069 --> 19:33.469
We can't let L.T. Blow up <i>Mad!</i>

19:33.572 --> 19:36.200
Tina Brown was just starting
to turn it around.

19:36.308 --> 19:40.711
- We gotta mellow him out!
- But how? We would need
the ultimate chill-out song.

19:40.812 --> 19:42.939
And fast!

19:49.588 --> 19:52.113
- We heard what you said.
- Yeah! Heard it old school.

19:52.224 --> 19:54.249
It's N'Sync!

19:54.359 --> 19:58.420
Can the chitchat, Milhouse. We've got just the song
you need to defuse this whack attack.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.964
- Defuse it old school.
- 'Bout time.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.129
- Radical!
- Awesome!

20:06.238 --> 20:09.207
- I can't read.
- I can't sing without dancing.

20:09.308 --> 20:11.799
Fine!

20:11.910 --> 20:15.471
Thrust, spin, turn.
Pivot, pout, jiggy.

20:15.581 --> 20:17.640
Jiggy, robot, do-si-do.

20:17.749 --> 20:20.843
And close with a Matrix.

20:22.621 --> 20:24.987
Nobody pouts going into a jiggy.

20:25.090 --> 20:27.991
- Yeah. That's stupid.
- I want to twirl!

20:28.093 --> 20:32.291
Aw, come on, guys.
We've only got a few minutes. Uh-oh.

20:39.304 --> 20:41.670
- Everybody okay?
- Uh, yeah.

20:41.773 --> 20:43.832
- Yeah. I'm fine. Thanks.
- I actually feel better.

20:47.646 --> 20:50.012
Well, boys, the Party Posse is over.

20:50.115 --> 20:53.084
But at least I saved you
from a public spoofing.

20:54.886 --> 20:57.719
Aw, man. We could've been
on the cover of <i>Mad.</i>

20:57.823 --> 21:01.623
They called me "Smelson!"
Ha-ha!

21:03.962 --> 21:06.760
Smelson.
It's funny 'cause you smell.

21:08.634 --> 21:11.535
Smelson.
I could've thought of that.

21:11.637 --> 21:14.606
Sure ya could've. Off ya go now.

21:18.143 --> 21:21.874
You know, we've had a lot of fun tonight
at the expense of the U.S. Navy.

21:21.980 --> 21:24.813
But they're out there every day
protecting us from Godzilla.

21:24.916 --> 21:27.248
- And don't forget pirates.
- And jellyfish.

21:27.352 --> 21:30.014
Those whack invertebrates
will sting you, old school!

21:30.122 --> 21:32.920
So check out the navy
for a two- or a four-year hitch.

21:33.025 --> 21:35.391
- We signed J.C. Up yesterday.
- What?

21:35.494 --> 21:38.258
No-o-o!

21:41.867 --> 21:45.735
<i>#Join the navy #</i>

21:45.837 --> 21:50.035
<i># Join the navy #</i>

21:50.142 --> 21:53.441
<i># Join the navy ##</i>

21:56.081 --> 21:57.571
It's N'Sync!

22:03.722 --> 22:07.283
D'oh! I can't believe
I'm meeting Milhouse.

22:07.392 --> 22:10.088
Yeah! Heard it old school!

22:10.195 --> 22:12.356
No-o-o!

22:12.464 --> 22:14.364
Bart was so cool.

22:14.466 --> 22:16.491
- Little short. He's about this tall.
- Don't print that.

22:22.908 --> 22:25.172
Word.

22:25.277 --> 22:27.802
- <i>Itjust sounds like something I would say.</i>
- Shh!
