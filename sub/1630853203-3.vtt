WEBVTT

00:08.269 --> 00:09.966
Previously
on "61st Street"...

00:10.097 --> 00:11.663
That's it.
That's the one.

00:11.794 --> 00:13.404
The prostate is enlarged.

00:13.535 --> 00:15.015
You okay?
Yeah.

00:15.145 --> 00:16.668
We could use your help
with this.

00:16.799 --> 00:18.627
13,000 cops
and they're not gonna be

00:18.757 --> 00:20.368
looking to take you
in alive.

00:20.498 --> 00:22.935
Defund the police!

00:23.066 --> 00:24.198
Bag and tag his clothes.

00:24.328 --> 00:26.330
Can you give me
some privacy?

00:26.461 --> 00:27.897
-How we lookin'?
-The house is all set.

00:28.028 --> 00:29.377
Cops don't know where he is.

00:29.507 --> 00:30.856
He needs to have his mother tell
him what to do.

00:30.987 --> 00:32.336
No! No!

00:32.467 --> 00:34.077
Moses!
Hey, don't shoot,
don't shoot.

00:34.208 --> 00:36.906
Run.Stop!
I'm this man's lawyer.

00:40.257 --> 00:42.520
Wait, where are
you taking him?

00:42.651 --> 00:44.696
Aye, man,
let me talk to my mom!

00:44.827 --> 00:45.523
Don't hurt him!

00:45.654 --> 00:46.959
Mama!

00:47.090 --> 00:48.657
Hey, let me talk to my mom,
man, please!

00:48.787 --> 00:51.703
Where are you
taking him?!

00:51.834 --> 00:52.965
Please!

00:53.096 --> 00:55.403
Let me talk to my mom.

00:57.231 --> 00:58.754
-Mo!

00:58.884 --> 01:00.060
-Aye, let me talk to her!
-Mo!

01:00.190 --> 01:02.627
Aye, Josh.
I ain't do anything, man!

01:02.758 --> 01:04.890
Why y'all gotta chain him
like that for, man?!

01:05.021 --> 01:07.328
-Okay, man, come on.
-Hold, hold up.
Hold, hold up, hold up.

01:07.458 --> 01:08.720
Don't you speak.
Not a word 'til I get there.

01:08.851 --> 01:09.852
I'm right behind you.
Do you hear me?

01:09.982 --> 01:11.332
Don't say a word!
Not a word!

01:11.462 --> 01:12.768
Mo!

01:12.898 --> 01:14.204
-Mama!
-It's okay, Mo!

01:16.163 --> 01:17.164
Thank you, Joshua.

01:18.861 --> 01:20.732
I got her.
I got her. I got her.

01:20.863 --> 01:22.256
I didn't even
do nothing, man!

01:22.386 --> 01:23.735
Aaargh!

01:23.866 --> 01:25.302
Alright, man, you got
this, aight, man?

01:25.433 --> 01:26.303
You gonna get out, aight?

01:26.434 --> 01:27.783
Aye, aye, Joshua!

01:27.913 --> 01:29.654
-You gonna get out!

01:29.785 --> 01:31.091
Man, y'all can't keep
doing this!

01:31.221 --> 01:34.094
Y'all can't keep doing
this shit, man!

01:36.270 --> 01:38.837
They can't keep fucking
doing this shit!

01:38.968 --> 01:40.404
You said
you're his lawyer.

01:40.535 --> 01:41.231
Yes.

01:41.362 --> 01:42.537
You be that.

01:42.667 --> 01:44.539
You be his lawyer.

01:44.669 --> 01:46.715
Mr. Franklin, please.

01:51.763 --> 01:53.287
Who made sergeant?

01:53.417 --> 01:54.940
Don't get bitter, Rossi.

01:55.071 --> 01:56.551
You won't get it
next time 'round, either,

01:56.681 --> 01:58.205
if you turn
into a bitter cop.

02:00.337 --> 02:03.123
You know,
my man in The Nation,

02:03.253 --> 02:04.428
he says all his people
are wondering

02:04.559 --> 02:06.517
why all the heat's on them,

02:06.648 --> 02:09.955
while The Faction get the
freedom of the South Side.

02:10.086 --> 02:12.132
That's just
what he tells me.

02:12.262 --> 02:13.611
And?

02:13.742 --> 02:15.352
Look...

02:15.483 --> 02:17.746
I don't care
who we take down.

02:17.876 --> 02:20.052
These people are
all the same to me.

02:20.183 --> 02:22.881
But they havegot to be
paying for that pass--

02:23.012 --> 02:24.579
The Faction.

02:24.709 --> 02:26.015
Paying who?

02:26.146 --> 02:27.495
It's just where
the heat is now.

02:29.627 --> 02:31.455
He got a name,

02:31.586 --> 02:33.109
your man in The Nation?

02:33.240 --> 02:34.371
Yeah.

02:34.502 --> 02:35.546
Tutu.

02:39.724 --> 02:42.727
But they havegot to be
paying for that pass--

02:42.858 --> 02:44.947
The Faction.

02:45.077 --> 02:45.817
Paying who?

03:06.708 --> 03:11.060
There's so much to love
about this town.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.018
Great food.

03:13.149 --> 03:16.196
Great teams.

03:16.326 --> 03:18.241
Great people.

03:18.372 --> 03:21.853
But you know what
I love the most?

03:21.984 --> 03:23.203
This damn lake.

03:25.640 --> 03:27.772
Always there

03:27.903 --> 03:30.732
and always different.

03:30.862 --> 03:31.994
Breaks my heart,
Michael Rossi

03:32.124 --> 03:35.258
will never see it again.

03:35.389 --> 03:36.520
You know how many
kids he had?

03:42.570 --> 03:43.310
Five.

03:47.749 --> 03:50.404
That has to be guilt.

03:50.534 --> 03:53.537
You were on the run,
but you had to know.

03:53.668 --> 03:54.408
Am I right?

03:57.454 --> 03:59.456
The thing about guilt --

03:59.587 --> 04:00.762
it comes from the gut.

04:02.677 --> 04:05.375
Like when you ran from us
on the corner.

04:05.506 --> 04:07.203
You weren't thinking.

04:07.334 --> 04:08.900
Your gut took over.

04:09.031 --> 04:10.337
When that happens,
you just do

04:10.467 --> 04:12.252
what your gut
tells you to do.

04:12.382 --> 04:15.342
My lawyer told me not
to talk to you.

04:15.472 --> 04:17.561
This ain't about lawyers.

04:17.692 --> 04:20.869
Judges, lawyers, they
don't buy the gut thing.

04:20.999 --> 04:22.871
They want reasons why.

04:23.001 --> 04:24.612
The gut's not in play
with those guys

04:24.742 --> 04:27.005
'cause they don't live
like we live.

04:27.136 --> 04:28.442
You and me, it's simple.

04:28.572 --> 04:30.879
You wanted to get away
from the cops, you ran.

04:31.009 --> 04:34.012
You wanted not to get caught
by a cop, you fought.

04:34.143 --> 04:36.363
That's all.

04:36.493 --> 04:38.974
The rest is just words.

04:39.104 --> 04:39.801
Right?

04:41.890 --> 04:42.586
Right.

04:48.636 --> 04:49.376
Okay.

05:01.562 --> 05:03.041
-Let's go!
-Aye.

05:09.831 --> 05:10.614
Unh!

06:04.364 --> 06:05.974
Shoelaces, belt.

06:37.484 --> 06:38.441
Come on, let's go.

06:51.976 --> 06:53.804
Give me 20 minutes
alone with him.

06:53.935 --> 06:56.328
Make sure it's not less.

06:56.459 --> 06:57.155
You got it.

07:11.300 --> 07:12.910
Your call has been forwarded.

07:27.664 --> 07:29.057
Get down here, now.

07:42.287 --> 07:43.898
I want to apologize.

07:47.336 --> 07:50.992
It got a little
aggressive back there.

07:51.122 --> 07:52.602
We lost one of our guys.

07:54.343 --> 07:57.564
Emotions run high.

07:59.566 --> 08:00.436
Please.

08:08.052 --> 08:11.795
I just got off the phone
with your coach, Angelo.

08:11.926 --> 08:16.321
Before that, I spoke
to your history teacher.

08:16.452 --> 08:18.106
Both full respect,

08:18.236 --> 08:20.891
for you
and who you are.

08:23.154 --> 08:25.200
I --

08:25.330 --> 08:26.941
I-I--

08:27.071 --> 08:28.333
I didn't do anything.
I didn't -- I didn't --

08:28.464 --> 08:30.074
I didn't
do anything.

08:30.205 --> 08:33.034
I've looked in the eyes
of some very bad people.

08:35.645 --> 08:38.430
And I feel like I can see
a man's soul in his eyes.

08:40.476 --> 08:43.740
I look at you,

08:43.871 --> 08:47.527
I see a good kid
who's been shaken up

08:47.657 --> 08:49.529
and needs a little help
settling down again.

08:53.271 --> 08:54.664
Moses, do you know what

08:54.795 --> 08:58.189
a memorandum
of cooperation is?

08:58.320 --> 09:01.976
It's an agreed version
of the truth.

09:02.106 --> 09:04.239
We agree on the truth.

09:04.369 --> 09:07.111
We cooperate
with each other.

09:07.242 --> 09:08.765
You get to go home
where you belong.

09:12.377 --> 09:14.205
So I wrote up
what we said in the car.

09:19.297 --> 09:22.823
"I knew they were police
and my gut said run,

09:22.953 --> 09:25.129
so I ran."

09:25.260 --> 09:26.043
That fair?

09:29.220 --> 09:31.919
"The cop chasing me had me
down a dead-end street."

09:33.660 --> 09:35.357
Blackstone
or South Blackstone?

09:42.886 --> 09:44.235
Blackstone.

09:44.366 --> 09:45.149
Thank you.

09:47.674 --> 09:49.589
Um...

09:49.719 --> 09:50.807
"I had to get away."

09:53.157 --> 09:55.333
"I made a move
toward the cop"?

09:55.464 --> 09:57.248
"I ran toward the cop"?
-I didn't -- that.

09:57.379 --> 09:58.815
I didn't do that.
I didn't intend for that.

09:58.946 --> 10:02.993
Maybe, maybe we do a little
lawyer language here.

10:03.124 --> 10:04.386
Sometimes easier.

10:04.516 --> 10:07.432
So that would be...

10:07.563 --> 10:13.395
"Pursuant to my attempt
to escape,

10:13.525 --> 10:15.702
there was physical contact...

10:17.747 --> 10:23.405
...between myself
and the police officer,

10:23.535 --> 10:25.363
as a consequence of which...

10:27.496 --> 10:28.497
...he hit his head."

10:31.065 --> 10:32.762
That didn't happen.
It didn't --

10:32.893 --> 10:34.155
I didn't intend
for that to happen

10:34.285 --> 10:35.460
because he was running
and I was trying

10:35.591 --> 10:36.897
to run at the side

10:37.027 --> 10:38.594
and I was trying --
-This is just you, me,

10:38.725 --> 10:40.727
and the facts.

10:40.857 --> 10:42.380
So, so, so,

10:42.511 --> 10:44.992
so what if I don't want
to do this memorandum?

10:45.122 --> 10:46.602
What if I
don't cooperate?

10:50.693 --> 10:52.173
Then, it'll be other cops.

10:53.783 --> 10:55.306
With all their anger

10:55.437 --> 10:57.134
about what happened
to one of their guys.

10:58.788 --> 11:01.748
If I can't show my people
proof of your cooperation,

11:01.878 --> 11:03.097
they pull me out

11:03.227 --> 11:05.665
and they pull in your mom
and Joshua

11:05.795 --> 11:08.406
and your buddy Marquise,

11:08.537 --> 11:09.930
on account of the pressure
they're under.

11:11.888 --> 11:13.281
But none of that happens

11:13.411 --> 11:15.065
if I show them
our memorandum.

11:16.110 --> 11:17.067
You sign this...

11:20.941 --> 11:22.290
...and everybody
stands down.

11:26.468 --> 11:27.948
I'll give you a minute
to think about it.

11:33.301 --> 11:34.911
Think about your
responsibilities.

11:51.841 --> 11:53.843
Aah!

12:11.208 --> 12:12.601
Sir, if you don't
fill out the form --

12:12.732 --> 12:14.255
You know who I am and you
know who I'm here to see.

12:14.385 --> 12:15.299
I'm not filling out
any form.

12:17.737 --> 12:20.130
You don't fill out the form,
you don't see your client.

12:20.261 --> 12:21.828
You're stalling me.
Please stop stalling me.

12:21.958 --> 12:23.264
Let me see my client,
please.

12:23.394 --> 12:24.482
Mr. Johnson is ready

12:24.613 --> 12:25.440
to see his lawyer.
-Thank you.

12:37.452 --> 12:38.148
We got him.

12:40.498 --> 12:43.153
What's he saying?

12:43.284 --> 12:44.285
We got that, too.

12:52.815 --> 12:55.122
What was the very last
thing I said?

12:55.252 --> 12:56.558
We just talked about what
happened in the car.

12:56.688 --> 12:58.647
-Moses, Moses!
-He sounded like he

12:58.778 --> 12:59.953
was trying to help me.
-Help you?!

13:00.083 --> 13:00.910
Yeah, that's
what it felt like!

13:01.041 --> 13:02.520
And now?

13:02.651 --> 13:04.261
How does it feel now?

13:07.874 --> 13:09.789
I don't feel guilty.

13:09.919 --> 13:11.399
I don't feel like I'm
a murderer or nothing.

13:11.529 --> 13:13.270
That piece of paper
you signed,

13:13.401 --> 13:14.968
in the eyes of the law,

13:15.098 --> 13:16.796
it says you're both.

13:22.671 --> 13:24.325
Law ain't right,
Mr. Franklin.

13:27.894 --> 13:28.938
The law ain't right.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.904
What'd you do to him?!

13:38.034 --> 13:38.774
Excuse me?

13:38.905 --> 13:39.862
You heard me.

13:39.993 --> 13:41.037
Officer Young.

13:42.996 --> 13:46.086
Can you help my lawyer
friend out here?

13:46.216 --> 13:48.610
Anything happen in the car
on the way to the station?

13:48.740 --> 13:49.654
Anything
you didn't like?

13:51.178 --> 13:52.919
Nope.

13:53.049 --> 13:53.963
So maybe it's you.

13:54.094 --> 13:54.834
What?

13:54.964 --> 13:56.009
Playing the race card.

13:56.139 --> 13:57.445
It's up the sleeve
of every

13:57.575 --> 13:58.881
liberal lawyer
in America right now.

13:59.012 --> 14:01.057
I see you, Brannigan.

14:01.188 --> 14:02.754
I know what you are.

14:02.885 --> 14:04.974
I've been seeing you
for the last 30 years,

14:05.105 --> 14:06.149
doing what I do.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.542
And Isee you.

14:07.672 --> 14:09.152
You're at the end
of your career

14:09.283 --> 14:10.632
and looking to go out
with a bang.

14:10.762 --> 14:11.938
You know your problem?

14:12.068 --> 14:14.288
Square peg, round hole.

14:14.418 --> 14:15.985
I'm just not
what you want me to be.

14:16.116 --> 14:18.422
I got to admit
I was surprised.

14:18.553 --> 14:20.381
Never had you down
as an ambulance chaser.

14:20.511 --> 14:21.512
Oh, yeah?

14:21.643 --> 14:22.687
Well, if it's not that,

14:22.818 --> 14:23.906
then how did you know

14:24.037 --> 14:25.473
where the most wanted
murder suspect

14:25.603 --> 14:26.822
in the history
of this city

14:26.953 --> 14:29.651
was hiding out,
and we didn't, hmm?

14:29.781 --> 14:31.914
What were you going
to do, Franklin,

14:32.045 --> 14:33.829
put him in the trunk
and head down to Mexico?

14:33.960 --> 14:35.091
You don't scare me,
Brannigan.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.486
Then you can leave.

14:38.616 --> 14:41.054
Or you can stay.

14:41.184 --> 14:42.533
But, if you stay,

14:42.664 --> 14:45.145
it's going to be on a charge
of obstructing justice

14:45.275 --> 14:46.842
and aiding and abetting
a fugitive.

14:59.028 --> 15:00.595
Hey, baby.

15:00.725 --> 15:02.510
The doctor called me.
What-What's going on,

15:02.640 --> 15:03.903
Franklin?
-It-It's -- It's nothing.

15:04.033 --> 15:05.078
Why does Dr. Algren need

15:05.208 --> 15:06.644
to speak to you so badly,

15:06.775 --> 15:08.820
he calls me three times?
-I missed an appointment.

15:08.951 --> 15:09.909
They hate it
when that happens.

15:10.039 --> 15:11.475
Is it your knee again?

15:11.606 --> 15:12.999
Oh, you got to be
kidding me.

15:13.129 --> 15:14.435
-Franklin.
-You got to be kidding.

15:14.565 --> 15:15.871
-What is it?
-I-I-I got to go.

15:16.002 --> 15:16.785
I-I'll see you tonight.
I love you.

15:16.916 --> 15:17.786
Franklin.

15:29.058 --> 15:30.712
-Jack.
-Are you kidding me?

15:30.842 --> 15:32.018
-Jack.
-A big murder

15:32.148 --> 15:33.323
five minutes
before you retire?

15:33.454 --> 15:34.672
I don't think so.
-Who gets it, Jack?

15:34.803 --> 15:35.804
-Not you.
-Yes, but who?

15:35.935 --> 15:37.458
-Danny Pascoe.
-Danny Pascoe --

15:37.588 --> 15:40.069
conveyor belt lawyer.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.244
I want this, Jack.

15:41.375 --> 15:43.203
You can't have it.

15:43.333 --> 15:46.032
Then it's over.

15:46.162 --> 15:47.990
What?

15:48.121 --> 15:49.861
If you won't let me
represent Moses Johnson

15:49.992 --> 15:53.126
as a public defender,
you give me no choice.

15:53.256 --> 15:53.953
What are you
talking about?

15:54.083 --> 15:55.867
I'm resigning, Jack,

15:55.998 --> 15:58.087
and I'm going to represent
him privately.

15:58.218 --> 15:59.959
This is crazy.

16:00.089 --> 16:02.962
Sometimes community
is the same as family,

16:03.092 --> 16:04.354
and that's where I am
with Moses.

16:04.485 --> 16:06.966
And, when it's family,
you don't say no.

16:07.096 --> 16:08.097
You step in.

16:08.228 --> 16:09.969
And nobody,
not even the man

16:10.099 --> 16:12.928
I trust most
in this whole building,

16:13.059 --> 16:15.148
is going to get in my way.

16:20.762 --> 16:22.851
Well, at least they're
paying attention.

16:22.982 --> 16:25.071
Maybe tone it down
a little?

16:28.857 --> 16:30.032
Oh, is that the reporter?

16:30.163 --> 16:31.077
Mm-hmm.

16:32.687 --> 16:33.557
Bet.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.561
Good afternoon!

16:37.692 --> 16:38.954
Good afternoon.

16:39.085 --> 16:40.912
Thank y'all for coming.

16:41.043 --> 16:44.568
So, there's a reporter here,
third row.

16:44.699 --> 16:46.309
We have Mr. Sessions, right?

16:46.440 --> 16:47.571
Peter Sessions.

16:47.702 --> 16:49.182
Yeah.

16:49.312 --> 16:52.446
Mr. Sessions is saying
that I am

16:52.576 --> 16:54.317
"barefoot and dangerous."

16:54.448 --> 16:55.710
-Mm.
-Ha!
-Dead right.

16:55.840 --> 16:56.972
No, it's alright. He's right.

16:57.103 --> 16:59.279
I amdangerous.

16:59.409 --> 17:04.414
Women have always been judged
in this way.

17:04.545 --> 17:07.287
Jeannette Rankin ran
for Congress in 1916

17:07.417 --> 17:10.507
and they said that her gowns
were too "severe."

17:10.638 --> 17:12.640
Hillary Clinton --
they said that she was

17:12.770 --> 17:14.816
"confused about her gender"

17:14.946 --> 17:17.471
because her pantsuits
were too baggy.

17:17.601 --> 17:19.560
After all of this time,

17:19.690 --> 17:21.083
they are still more comfortable

17:21.214 --> 17:24.478
with women carrying babies
than ballots.

17:24.608 --> 17:26.610
Come on, now.
-And here I come,

17:26.741 --> 17:29.135
shoeless, barefoot me,

17:29.265 --> 17:33.008
and he is more concerned
about what is not on my feet

17:33.139 --> 17:34.792
than what is coming
out of my mouth.

17:34.923 --> 17:36.707
Say that.

17:36.838 --> 17:38.361
So we have to ask ourselves,

17:38.492 --> 17:42.235
what is -- is hiding
underneath the cheap headline?

17:43.932 --> 17:45.716
I know.

17:45.847 --> 17:48.763
Everywoman
in this room knows.
Right.

17:48.893 --> 17:51.983
- Right.
- It's fear.

17:52.114 --> 17:56.162
It's fear because I am
demanding accountability

17:56.292 --> 17:58.164
from the
Chicago Police Department.

17:58.294 --> 17:59.556
- Say that!
- Right!

17:59.687 --> 18:01.950
Fear that I want to end policing

18:02.081 --> 18:05.693
that's just personal security
for rich white folks.

18:05.823 --> 18:08.826
Tell 'em, tell 'em.
-Fear that I am demanding an end

18:08.957 --> 18:12.308
to the executions of Black
and brown children.

18:12.439 --> 18:14.789
Fear I want to build a movement.

18:14.919 --> 18:17.313
I want to build a future
where Black and brown children

18:17.444 --> 18:18.967
can bechildren

18:19.098 --> 18:21.491
and where they are safe
and where they can thrive.

18:21.622 --> 18:25.495
And Mr. Sessions here is afraid
because, in that future,

18:25.626 --> 18:27.889
he has to lose
his first place in line.

18:28.019 --> 18:30.326
It ain't about my shoes!

18:30.457 --> 18:32.502
It ain't
about my shoes.

18:32.633 --> 18:34.200
Don't get distracted!

18:34.330 --> 18:36.027
It's about my ideas.

18:36.158 --> 18:37.899
Alright now. Alright now.

18:38.029 --> 18:39.335
- Tell it. Tell it.
- Tell it.

18:39.466 --> 18:40.684
That's what
I'm talking about.

18:40.815 --> 18:42.338
Wonderful, baby.
That was brilliant.

18:42.469 --> 18:44.079
Franklin,
why aren't you at work?

18:44.210 --> 18:46.212
It's --
It's complicated.

18:46.342 --> 18:47.343
Now -- Now, you know
you're scaring me.

18:47.474 --> 18:49.215
I-I resigned.

18:49.345 --> 18:51.304
It's -- It's not about me.
-Franklin, why don't you just --

18:51.434 --> 18:53.088
just tell me what's going on.
-It's not about me.

18:53.219 --> 18:54.785
-Okay, well, who is it about?
-It's about Moses.

18:54.916 --> 18:56.222
Moses Johnson. I'm --
-What?!

18:56.352 --> 18:58.311
I'm his lawyer, only they
don't want me to be.

18:58.441 --> 19:00.226
-So, so you resigned, right?
-I wanted --

19:00.356 --> 19:01.401
I wanted to talk
to you about it.

19:01.531 --> 19:02.576
-No.
-No, no, baby.

19:02.706 --> 19:04.578
I-I wanted --
-No, no, no.

19:05.753 --> 19:07.407
We agreed.

19:07.537 --> 19:08.451
No, no, no.

19:08.582 --> 19:09.713
We agreed.

19:09.844 --> 19:11.193
I want Moses Johnson

19:11.324 --> 19:13.717
to have the best
representation possible.

19:13.848 --> 19:15.502
I want that.

19:15.632 --> 19:17.373
But you, you --
you promised me.

19:17.504 --> 19:19.419
You looked me in my eyes
and you said,

19:19.549 --> 19:21.334
"After 17 years at home,

19:21.464 --> 19:23.249
after 17 years
at home, now,

19:23.379 --> 19:24.946
now, it's your chance,"
right?

19:25.076 --> 19:26.208
You said that to me.

19:26.339 --> 19:28.645
We know Moses!
He's a bright light now.

19:28.776 --> 19:30.560
I'm sorry,
you're representing
the cop killer?

19:32.258 --> 19:34.869
His name is
Moses Johnson.

19:34.999 --> 19:38.220
That's F-r-a-n-k-l-i-n.

19:38.351 --> 19:40.179
Franklin, like Roosevelt?

19:40.309 --> 19:42.093
Franklin, as in Aretha.

19:42.964 --> 19:45.401
So you got
the cop killer's back.

19:45.532 --> 19:48.056
You're calling
for defunding the police.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.710
You two are
quite the pair.

19:54.410 --> 19:55.455
To Michael.

19:55.585 --> 19:56.543
To Michael.

19:56.673 --> 19:57.848
-To Michael.
-To Mike.

19:57.979 --> 19:58.893
Salute.

19:59.023 --> 19:59.850
Sláinte.

20:06.640 --> 20:08.076
The last thing
we talked about,

20:08.207 --> 20:10.383
I invited him here.

20:10.513 --> 20:12.515
Said he wanted to get home
to Jessica and the kids.

20:14.952 --> 20:16.824
Last time I saw him,
he was, uh,

20:16.954 --> 20:18.478
really gunning for that
sergeant position,

20:18.608 --> 20:21.742
you know,
making me pop-quiz him.

20:24.397 --> 20:25.441
I'd like to think that
he would've got it.

20:27.530 --> 20:29.489
Where was he
on the list?

20:29.619 --> 20:31.447
Third.

20:31.578 --> 20:32.666
Wrote a great exam.

20:32.796 --> 20:34.145
So, he would've got it.

20:34.276 --> 20:35.669
Absolutely.

20:35.799 --> 20:38.019
Uh, Leo-Leonard makes the --

20:38.149 --> 20:40.064
makes the call?
-Deputy superintendent, yeah.

20:40.195 --> 20:41.501
He's a good guy.

20:41.631 --> 20:43.285
He would've wanted Michael
for sergeant.

20:43.416 --> 20:44.199
Hm.

20:48.159 --> 20:49.422
When was the last time
youspoke to him?

20:50.684 --> 20:52.425
Before the bust.

20:52.555 --> 20:53.382
He came to see me.

20:55.210 --> 20:56.211
Do you remember
what you talked about?

20:59.170 --> 21:00.476
Sure.

21:00.607 --> 21:02.870
I askedto see him.

21:03.000 --> 21:05.176
I knew he was trying
to plan a vacation

21:05.307 --> 21:07.048
and five kids
makes it hard,

21:07.178 --> 21:08.919
so I just wanted
to offer him my cabin,

21:09.050 --> 21:10.486
you know, free of charge.

21:10.617 --> 21:12.662
Well, shit,
now that he's dead,

21:12.793 --> 21:14.273
hell, I'll take you up
on that.

21:14.403 --> 21:15.883
-Come on.

21:16.013 --> 21:18.233
No, kids, but I got a wife
and three girlfriends.

21:20.017 --> 21:21.671
-Ah!
-Where's the cabin at,

21:21.802 --> 21:23.282
in the lake somewhere?

21:23.412 --> 21:24.152
82nd Street.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.675
-Aw.

21:25.806 --> 21:28.243
Sit out on the rocker
on the porch.

21:28.374 --> 21:30.593
Sweet sound of gunshots.

21:30.724 --> 21:32.029
Smell the vinegar.

21:33.901 --> 21:34.597
Vinegar?

21:36.033 --> 21:38.297
You never noticed?

21:38.427 --> 21:39.689
Blood smells like vinegar.

21:43.258 --> 21:44.955
How about you?

21:45.086 --> 21:46.174
Last conversation.

21:48.611 --> 21:50.961
Tsk. Pbbt.

21:51.092 --> 21:53.486
Baseball.

21:53.616 --> 21:54.791
He had money on the Sox.

22:03.365 --> 22:07.282
Michael was like a brother
to Johnny,

22:07.413 --> 22:11.112
which made him a son to me.

22:11.242 --> 22:14.898
I want you children
to look around you now,

22:15.029 --> 22:17.118
into all the faces here,

22:17.248 --> 22:20.208
and know,
as you look at each of them,

22:20.339 --> 22:24.647
that you may have lost
a father,

22:24.778 --> 22:30.697
but you have gained
a new family for life.

22:30.827 --> 22:32.873
We stand together.

22:39.401 --> 22:40.881
Hey, Johnny.

22:41.011 --> 22:41.838
Be alright, Johnny.

22:53.894 --> 22:56.287
But he turned the car over.

22:58.942 --> 23:00.466
Hey.

23:00.596 --> 23:01.945
Dad,

23:02.076 --> 23:03.991
can I talk
to you just for a minute?

23:04.121 --> 23:04.818
Yeah.

23:10.171 --> 23:11.607
It was a different
time back then.

23:20.747 --> 23:21.617
So?

23:21.748 --> 23:22.966
I think that --

23:24.968 --> 23:27.406
I think Michael
might've been

23:27.536 --> 23:29.408
doing something.

23:29.538 --> 23:30.844
"Doing something"?

23:33.673 --> 23:36.502
He had a wire.

23:36.632 --> 23:37.503
And he didn't tell me.

23:39.243 --> 23:42.246
I don't know what
you're talking about,

23:42.377 --> 23:45.249
but I do know

23:45.380 --> 23:47.295
your partner is lying
six feet

23:47.426 --> 23:50.385
on the other side
of the dirt.

23:50.516 --> 23:54.041
His reputation
and loyalty to the job

23:54.171 --> 23:55.869
is supporting
an entire family

23:55.999 --> 23:57.610
on the other side
of that yard.

23:57.740 --> 23:59.089
You understand
what that means?

23:59.220 --> 24:00.221
Yeah, I --

24:00.351 --> 24:03.137
It means $50,000
off the top.

24:03.267 --> 24:04.834
Another 100 grand.

24:04.965 --> 24:10.753
College tuition
for all five kids, paid!

24:10.884 --> 24:12.451
Now, you heard enough,
or you want me to go on?

24:14.278 --> 24:17.543
Look, Michael Rossi
just died a hero.

24:17.673 --> 24:19.458
You want to turn that
upside-down?

24:19.588 --> 24:20.502
Alright, I got it.

24:20.633 --> 24:21.460
Good!

24:24.158 --> 24:28.945
Because every man
has secrets

24:29.076 --> 24:32.471
and, if he's lucky enough
to take them to the grave,

24:32.601 --> 24:34.298
then that's where
they should stay.

24:49.836 --> 24:50.967
Ah.

25:04.024 --> 25:06.330
Thought I heard a ghost.

25:06.461 --> 25:07.941
Should've figured
it was you.

25:08.071 --> 25:09.856
Yeah, well, Michael
always had a bottle

25:09.986 --> 25:11.597
for a special occasion
and, uh,

25:11.727 --> 25:12.902
this is as special
as any.

25:37.274 --> 25:38.493
Here, he'd want you
to have this.

25:46.153 --> 25:48.068
We fought for this thing.

25:48.198 --> 25:49.939
The arc of the ball,
we-- we knew it was --

25:50.070 --> 25:51.506
it was coming
right for us and --

25:51.637 --> 25:55.902
and we fought like --
like crazy, and --

25:56.032 --> 25:56.990
and he won.

26:00.689 --> 26:02.691
And we carried on.

26:02.822 --> 26:06.173
Like what we had was --

26:06.303 --> 26:08.871
It was too strong.
It was -- It was too --

26:09.002 --> 26:11.787
It was too honest

26:11.918 --> 26:13.572
to ever get derailed.
Do you know what I'm saying?

26:13.702 --> 26:15.356
It was -- It would've been
the same if I caught the ball.

26:26.585 --> 26:28.717
He was wearing a wire
the day he died, Jessica.

26:30.676 --> 26:31.459
He didn't tell me.

26:37.030 --> 26:38.901
I thought that it --

26:39.032 --> 26:39.772
Well, who was he --

26:39.902 --> 26:42.731
-Hey, Mom.
-Hi.

26:42.862 --> 26:44.994
Hi, sweetie.

26:45.125 --> 26:45.952
You okay?

26:50.826 --> 26:52.785
What's a wire?

26:52.915 --> 26:55.004
Um,

26:55.135 --> 26:58.312
a wire is

26:58.442 --> 27:01.707
something a --
a police officer wears

27:01.837 --> 27:03.143
when -- when he wants
to record

27:03.273 --> 27:04.405
someone saying something
without --

27:04.535 --> 27:05.275
without anyone hearing.

27:07.974 --> 27:11.064
You know,
I think your dad,

27:11.194 --> 27:12.413
he would've wanted you
to have this.

28:05.248 --> 28:06.249
Ma.

28:06.380 --> 28:07.076
Hey.

28:10.906 --> 28:11.646
You okay?

28:13.300 --> 28:13.996
Yeah.

28:22.788 --> 28:24.659
What's good witchu, bro?

28:24.790 --> 28:25.747
Man, this shit crazy.

28:25.878 --> 28:27.836
Stay away from them.

28:27.967 --> 28:28.707
Come on.

28:42.677 --> 28:44.157
Hey, Steve.

28:44.287 --> 28:45.506
Come on, Logan,

28:45.636 --> 28:47.377
don't tell me they
got you working today.

28:47.508 --> 28:48.683
No.

28:48.814 --> 28:50.641
So?

28:50.772 --> 28:52.469
Just, uh, want to get
a look, you know?

28:59.868 --> 29:02.044
I tried so many things

29:02.175 --> 29:04.351
But nothing but God will

29:04.481 --> 29:05.700
God will

29:11.662 --> 29:16.015
- Yeah-eah-eah, yeah-eah-eah

29:30.159 --> 29:32.074
-Praise the Lord.
-Hallelujah.

29:32.205 --> 29:33.032
-Thank you, Jesus.

29:33.162 --> 29:34.120
-Yes.

29:34.250 --> 29:35.512
-Thank you.
Praise Him.

29:37.340 --> 29:38.124
-Praise Him.
-Amen.

29:41.083 --> 29:42.781
In the name of the Father
and of the Son

29:42.911 --> 29:44.347
and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.

29:44.478 --> 29:45.740
Amen.

29:47.916 --> 29:49.788
O loving and gracious God,

29:49.918 --> 29:52.660
please, bless this house
on this day of mourning.

29:52.791 --> 29:53.748
-Yes!
-Yes.

29:53.879 --> 29:55.402
-Jesus!
-Yes, Lord.

29:55.532 --> 29:58.187
Though anger lives
in the hearts of all mankind...

29:58.318 --> 29:59.798
-Yes.
-Yes, God, yeah.

29:59.928 --> 30:01.495
...let us not act
on this anger

30:01.625 --> 30:03.410
with vindictiveness,
Father...

30:04.890 --> 30:05.891
...but with compassion.
-Yes.

30:06.021 --> 30:07.718
Yes, sir.

30:07.849 --> 30:11.461
Let us not lean
unto our own understanding,

30:11.592 --> 30:13.115
but accept thy will

30:13.246 --> 30:15.030
as infinite wisdom.
-No disrespect.

30:15.161 --> 30:16.771
I'mma need you
to get out of here.

30:16.902 --> 30:18.120
Open and free
to the public, my man.

30:18.251 --> 30:19.992
Maybe.
Maybe so.

30:20.122 --> 30:21.080
I ain't gonna ask again.

30:21.210 --> 30:23.212
No, he ain't.

30:23.343 --> 30:25.171
This the world we live in.
right here.

30:25.301 --> 30:26.433
Good. I'm glad
we had this talk.

30:26.563 --> 30:27.738
I don't want
to get louder

30:27.869 --> 30:30.480
in front of God
and my man's mama,

30:30.611 --> 30:32.134
but you got a lot of nerve,
showing up in here.

30:35.137 --> 30:37.357
I know you.

30:37.487 --> 30:39.620
You with the pig
that pulled the trigger,

30:39.750 --> 30:41.056
sent Tutu
to an early grave.

30:44.451 --> 30:46.540
-Tutu?
-Only reason we don't
smack you up here

30:46.670 --> 30:48.281
is out of respect
for Miss Janet.

30:48.411 --> 30:49.848
-But outside...
-Outside?

30:49.978 --> 30:51.501
Okay, okay,
let's keep the peace.

30:51.632 --> 30:53.329
-Okay.
-Mm! Praise the Lord.

30:53.460 --> 30:54.853
-Pastor.
-Tough now, boy.

31:36.198 --> 31:38.897
These people
are all the same to me.

31:39.027 --> 31:41.725
But they havegot to be
paying for that pass--

31:41.856 --> 31:43.075
The Faction.

31:43.205 --> 31:44.511
Paying who?

31:44.641 --> 31:46.861
It's just where
the heat is now.

31:46.992 --> 31:48.167
He got a name,

31:48.297 --> 31:50.778
your man in The Nation?

31:50.909 --> 31:53.128
Yeah.

31:53.259 --> 31:55.087
Tutu.

31:55.217 --> 31:55.914
Jesus.

31:56.044 --> 31:56.915
Tutu.

31:58.568 --> 32:00.179
Tutu is Rufus.

32:11.973 --> 32:13.061
Come in, Franklin.

32:13.192 --> 32:13.975
Thank you.

32:21.940 --> 32:24.725
You want to dance a little,
or should I spell it out?

32:24.855 --> 32:25.639
I don't dance.

32:28.381 --> 32:29.251
It's cancer.

32:32.515 --> 32:34.474
I need to see
if it spread,

32:34.604 --> 32:37.868
so the next step is
a body scan.

32:37.999 --> 32:38.826
So what...?

32:38.957 --> 32:42.569
The Gleason score is high.

32:42.699 --> 32:45.006
What does that mean?

32:45.137 --> 32:46.877
It means it's
an aggressive cancer.

32:51.708 --> 32:52.535
What does that mean?

32:56.061 --> 32:57.323
We have a fight
on our hands.

33:20.737 --> 33:22.304
So have you ever been
in the paper before,

33:22.435 --> 33:23.871
like in your school paper?
-Hey!

33:25.481 --> 33:27.135
What are you doing?

33:27.266 --> 33:28.267
My job.

33:28.397 --> 33:29.790
My son?

33:29.920 --> 33:32.358
My son, now?
-You know, David was telling me

33:32.488 --> 33:33.185
that this is not the fir--
-Oh, no, no, no.

33:33.315 --> 33:34.186
You don't know him.

33:34.316 --> 33:36.449
Don't call him by his name.

33:36.579 --> 33:37.798
So, freedom
of the press matters,

33:37.928 --> 33:38.886
unless the story's

33:39.017 --> 33:41.062
about you?
-You get away

33:41.193 --> 33:42.281
from my house.

33:42.411 --> 33:43.978
You get away from my son,

33:44.109 --> 33:45.501
now.

33:45.632 --> 33:46.720
Or what, you gonna
call the police?

33:46.850 --> 33:47.677
-Mom, are you okay?
-Get up.

33:47.808 --> 33:49.027
-Huh?
-Is this

33:49.157 --> 33:50.376
okay?
-Yes, it's fine, baby.

33:50.506 --> 33:52.291
Go in the house.
-Hey, David?

33:52.421 --> 33:53.770
David, man, can I ask you
one more question?

33:53.901 --> 33:55.946
-Get!
-Ooh!

33:56.077 --> 33:57.687
Got it?
Come on. Stay with me.

33:57.818 --> 33:59.298
Stay with me.
Okay.

33:59.428 --> 34:00.908
Okay, go ahead,
go ahead.

34:04.346 --> 34:05.869
Watch your fingers.

34:13.268 --> 34:14.313
Mr. Franklin.

34:15.662 --> 34:16.967
It's going to be alright.

34:17.794 --> 34:19.100
Moses Johnson!

34:25.237 --> 34:26.194
From over there?

34:28.501 --> 34:29.763
You're here.

34:29.893 --> 34:30.894
Did you think
I wouldn't be?

34:31.025 --> 34:32.940
No.

34:34.333 --> 34:35.508
So, what do I do?

34:35.638 --> 34:37.727
I'm going
to ask for more time.

34:37.858 --> 34:38.989
What about bail?

34:39.120 --> 34:40.295
Counselor,
have you had a chance

34:40.426 --> 34:41.818
to meet with the
state's attorney?

34:41.949 --> 34:43.646
I'm -- I'm sorry,
Your Honor, I did not.

34:43.777 --> 34:45.909
Okay...
Back in a week,

34:46.040 --> 34:48.738
at which time,
we will enter a plea.

34:48.869 --> 34:50.436
Until then,
given the circumstances

34:50.566 --> 34:53.656
and gravity of the offense,
bail is set at $1 million.

34:53.787 --> 34:55.397
Your -- Your Honor, you --
Your Honor,

34:55.528 --> 34:57.182
you know there's no way
this family

34:57.312 --> 34:58.835
can raise that kind
of bail money.

34:58.966 --> 35:01.447
Well, the murder
of a police officer, Counselor.

35:01.577 --> 35:03.579
I mean, don't tell me
he's not a flight risk.

35:03.710 --> 35:05.581
None of us were born yesterday.

35:05.712 --> 35:06.887
Next.
-Your -- Your Honor,

35:07.017 --> 35:08.976
please.
-Next!

35:09.107 --> 35:10.108
$1 million?

35:10.238 --> 35:11.718
Don't worry.
Don't worry.

35:11.848 --> 35:13.023
I got you.
-It's okay, sweetie.

35:14.503 --> 35:15.504
I love you.

35:22.685 --> 35:25.123
$1 million means we have
to post $100,000,

35:25.253 --> 35:26.559
which is obviously
out of the question,

35:26.689 --> 35:28.561
so we --
-100 grand, he can come home?

35:28.691 --> 35:30.258
Well, yes,
but you still got

35:30.389 --> 35:31.607
to raise that.
-Then that's what we'll do.

35:33.740 --> 35:35.307
This is my son
we're talking about.

35:35.437 --> 35:37.178
It's his life.

35:37.309 --> 35:38.875
If it's money that we need,
it's money we'll get.

35:39.006 --> 35:40.050
-But how are you going to --
Aye.

35:40.181 --> 35:41.617
You let me worry
about that.

35:41.748 --> 35:44.229
I'll do what I have to do,
and you will, too.

35:44.359 --> 35:46.231
You made a promise.

35:46.361 --> 35:48.624
I trust you, you trust me,
we prevail.

35:50.060 --> 35:50.844
Right.

36:08.166 --> 36:10.559
Hi, Dr. Algren.
Martha Roberts.

36:10.690 --> 36:12.779
Hello, Martha.

36:12.909 --> 36:14.302
I'm so sorry
about Franklin.

36:14.433 --> 36:17.958
It's...tough,
for all of you.

36:18.088 --> 36:21.788
Cancer...is a hard word
to handle,

36:21.918 --> 36:23.833
which makes your role
critical.

36:25.270 --> 36:26.096
Martha.

36:47.553 --> 36:49.337
-We got a couple keys.
-How much

36:49.468 --> 36:50.512
Look, look.

36:50.643 --> 36:51.861
Mo's mom.

36:54.168 --> 36:56.301
You drove Joshua there.

36:56.431 --> 36:58.303
That'd be the kindness
of your heart, right,

36:58.433 --> 36:59.565
community work?

36:59.695 --> 37:01.088
Miss Norma,
it ain't even like that.

37:01.219 --> 37:02.394
We just over there --
-What you not gonna do is

37:02.524 --> 37:04.265
call yourself
a friend of my son.

37:04.396 --> 37:06.311
Not even associates.

37:06.441 --> 37:08.182
You don't talk to him.

37:08.313 --> 37:10.315
And, if I even catch you
looking at him sideways,

37:10.445 --> 37:13.013
I'll put a bullet
in your ass myself.

37:13.143 --> 37:14.319
-Yo, ma dukes ain't --
-Shut up.

37:21.978 --> 37:23.458
-Back around.
-Aight, man.

37:23.589 --> 37:24.633
Okay.

37:24.764 --> 37:26.113
Come on, man.

38:24.302 --> 38:25.085
Logan.

38:42.494 --> 38:44.191
-What was that?
-Huh?

38:44.322 --> 38:45.932
What do you mean,
"huh"?

38:46.062 --> 38:47.890
Gangbanger funeral
that damn near turned

38:48.021 --> 38:49.588
into yourfuneral.

38:49.718 --> 38:52.547
I-I was mad and --

38:56.464 --> 38:58.074
You know,
I listened to my dad

38:58.205 --> 38:59.815
talk about Michael and --
and it just --

38:59.946 --> 39:02.209
and -- and then,
it made me

39:02.340 --> 39:03.428
just want to go
and take out

39:03.558 --> 39:04.820
every asshole
who had anything to do

39:04.951 --> 39:06.518
with Michael's death,
I want dead.

39:06.648 --> 39:09.651
I know
I'm not supposed to.

39:09.782 --> 39:12.219
You know, the wrong
people stay alive and --

39:14.439 --> 39:15.614
...and the wrong
people die.

39:18.660 --> 39:20.619
So, a bottle of Scotch
on your own?

39:23.883 --> 39:25.363
Maybe once.

39:27.974 --> 39:30.542
But what you really need?

39:30.672 --> 39:32.457
Stay close to the people

39:32.587 --> 39:34.067
who know what you're
going through.

39:34.197 --> 39:36.025
Yeah.

39:36.156 --> 39:38.767
And, if you won't do that,

39:38.898 --> 39:40.290
we'll stay close to you.

39:45.383 --> 39:46.688
Poker night is Wednesday.

40:58.673 --> 40:59.761
You the police?

41:03.417 --> 41:05.550
I'm -- I'm a lawyer.

41:05.680 --> 41:07.160
What kind of lawyer?

41:07.290 --> 41:08.988
Moses Johnson's lawyer.

41:11.730 --> 41:12.861
I saw what happened.

41:19.041 --> 41:20.739
You want to --

41:20.869 --> 41:22.915
You want to talk to me
about that?

41:25.439 --> 41:26.701
Not right here.

41:26.832 --> 41:28.311
O-Okay, okay.

41:30.313 --> 41:31.750
My way of thinking is

41:31.880 --> 41:33.795
cops see Blackness
as a weapon.

41:35.188 --> 41:37.407
Being Black is like,
I don't know,

41:37.538 --> 41:40.236
I might as well have a gun,
you feel me?

41:40.367 --> 41:43.457
So running and fighting,
like Moses did?

41:43.588 --> 41:45.677
That's self-defense.

41:45.807 --> 41:48.810
But they don't see it
like that.

41:48.941 --> 41:50.812
Or they're blind to it.

41:50.943 --> 41:54.947
But the thing to be is
to make the blind see.

41:55.077 --> 41:55.817
You okay?

41:57.036 --> 41:57.732
You sick or something?

41:59.604 --> 42:00.561
Get in here.

42:00.692 --> 42:03.346
Get in here, boy.

42:03.477 --> 42:06.959
"Pursuant
to my attempt to escape,

42:07.089 --> 42:08.526
there was physical contact

42:08.656 --> 42:11.398
between myself
and the police officer,

42:11.529 --> 42:15.097
as a consequence of which
he hit his head."

42:26.456 --> 42:29.242
They think that's
your confession.

42:29.372 --> 42:30.373
It's not.

42:33.115 --> 42:34.552
It's your defense.

43:10.936 --> 43:12.241
Hey, hey, hey.

43:13.895 --> 43:15.505
Here we go!

43:17.551 --> 43:18.334
What's up?

43:26.908 --> 43:28.170
Hey, what you doing?

43:28.301 --> 43:29.084
I know.

43:33.523 --> 43:36.788
I spoke to Dr. Algren.

43:36.918 --> 43:37.615
I know.

44:30.145 --> 44:31.669
On the next episode
of 61st Street...

44:31.799 --> 44:33.758
I have an idea,
and it means you and me

44:33.888 --> 44:36.369
fighting this
and fighting them.

44:36.499 --> 44:39.807
They're gonna come after us
with everything they got.

44:39.938 --> 44:41.504
They comin' for yo ass.

44:41.635 --> 44:43.245
You comin' with us,
you stay alive.

44:43.376 --> 44:44.682
Against the wall.

44:44.812 --> 44:47.119
The question you most want
an answer to is,

44:47.249 --> 44:49.251
"Who killed my son?"
it was me.

44:49.382 --> 44:53.560
Is the law and justice the same
thing? Shouldn't it be?
