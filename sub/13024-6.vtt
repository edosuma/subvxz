01:07.743 --> 01:12.957
- I can't tell if he looks healthy or not.
- I think he's breathing weird.

01:13.040 --> 01:15.876
- Oh, come on!
- Not yet! A few more ticks.

01:15.960 --> 01:19.338
How much better do you think
he's gonna get in a few more ticks?

01:19.421 --> 01:22.383
- And what exactly is a tick?
- You know, a time slice.

01:22.466 --> 01:25.302
- Like a second?
- What is a "second"?

01:26.011 --> 01:27.346
Like this.

01:28.347 --> 01:32.476
I'm not sure. 
I think ticks are bigger.

01:32.559 --> 01:35.271
- Coran, do you have a ticker?
- Right here, Princess.

01:39.358 --> 01:41.527
I think ticks are a little slower.

01:41.610 --> 01:44.488
I can't tell. We have to start them
at the same time.

01:44.571 --> 01:46.740
Okay. Ready, go!

01:48.492 --> 01:49.994
Yes! I think we're winning.

01:50.077 --> 01:53.789
Winning what? The intergalactic
time-measuring competition?

01:53.872 --> 01:54.790
Yes.

01:57.793 --> 01:59.587
You guys having a clock party?

01:59.670 --> 02:03.299
Aw, Lance, you just ruined it.
Hey, Lance!

02:04.508 --> 02:06.218
What happened?

02:06.302 --> 02:10.681
We can tell you all about it while you get
something to eat. Are you able to walk?

02:10.764 --> 02:14.810
Talking? Eating?
Are you asking me out on a date?

02:16.228 --> 02:18.689
- Yep, he's okay.
- Classic.

02:20.816 --> 02:23.402
He'd be Sendak's prisoner right now,
if not for Pidge.

02:23.485 --> 02:25.863
Well, you wouldn't have
survived the explosion

02:25.946 --> 02:28.407
if Hunk and Coran hadn't
gotten a new crystal.

02:28.490 --> 02:32.328
Wow. Thanks, everybody. Sounds like
the mice did more than you, though.

02:32.411 --> 02:33.996
I punched Sendak!

02:34.079 --> 02:37.916
Yeah, apparently after I emerged
from a coma and shot his arm off.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.253
We had a bonding moment.
I cradled you in my arms!

02:41.337 --> 02:45.341
Nope. Don't remember, didn't happen.
So, what happened to Sendak?

02:45.424 --> 02:49.136
He's frozen in a cryo-pod.
We're keeping him here in the Castle.

02:49.762 --> 02:51.972
<i>Are you sure that's a good idea?</i>

02:52.056 --> 02:53.974
<i>He's too dangerous to be set free.</i>

02:54.058 --> 02:58.354
<i>Besides, we might be able to get
some information about Zarkon from him.</i>

02:58.437 --> 03:00.814
So, what's the plan now?

03:00.898 --> 03:04.360
We have to get back to the Balmera
and save Shay and her people.

03:04.443 --> 03:08.197
- Wow! You are really hung up on this lady.
- No, it's not like that.

03:08.322 --> 03:12.368
Look guys, when you see how Zarkon has treated
these people and destroyed their home...

03:12.451 --> 03:16.538
they've been under his thumb for so long,
they don't know what it is to be free.

03:16.622 --> 03:20.709
It's up to us to set this right. This is
what being a paladin of Voltron is all about.

03:20.793 --> 03:22.503
It's time to man up.

03:22.586 --> 03:25.547
Then let's get moving.
Time to go defend the universe.

03:26.382 --> 03:30.010
Wait, I have something to say first.
I need to come clean.

03:30.094 --> 03:33.055
I'm afraid this may change
the way you all think about me.

03:34.181 --> 03:38.852
Just so there are no secrets
between us anymore, I can't "man up."

03:39.728 --> 03:43.857
I'm a girl. I mean, I can "man up"
because that's just a figure of speech.

03:43.941 --> 03:48.028
I don't have to actually be a man
to "man up." I just have to be tough.

03:48.112 --> 03:51.448
- But what I'm saying...
- Wha...? You're a girl? How?

03:51.532 --> 03:54.993
I've known for some time, but I'm glad
you've shared it with everyone.

03:55.077 --> 03:56.829
- Yeah, I figured.
- Oh, yeah, me too.

03:56.912 --> 03:59.373
Wait, we were supposed
to think you were a boy?

03:59.456 --> 04:02.793
Pidge, owning who you are is going
to make you a better paladin.

04:04.294 --> 04:08.215
It's good to get that off my chest.
Now, let's launch this Castle-ship!

04:08.298 --> 04:11.885
Wait, what? Pidge is a girl
and the Castle is a ship?

04:11.969 --> 04:13.762
How long have I been out?

04:36.410 --> 04:37.953
Activate interlock.

04:38.036 --> 04:39.913
Dynotherms connected.

04:43.459 --> 04:45.586
Mega-thrusters are go.

04:46.211 --> 04:49.590
We are ready to depart Planet Arus
on your mark, Princess.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.509
Firing main engines for launch.

05:26.960 --> 05:30.923
Sire, if capturing Voltron is
the Empire's number-one priority,

05:31.006 --> 05:33.383
then I suggest we begin
moving the main fleet

05:33.467 --> 05:36.345
toward its last known location posthaste.

05:36.428 --> 05:41.225
Lord, after many years,
the Komar experiment is finally ready.

05:41.308 --> 05:46.313
Soon, we could have more quintessence
at our fingertips than ever imagined.

05:46.396 --> 05:49.024
We must test it before moving the fleet.

05:49.107 --> 05:51.534
We don't have time for
any more of your magic.

05:51.535 --> 05:53.153
We must move our ships now.

05:53.779 --> 05:56.490
Voltron is the most
powerful weapon ever created.

05:56.573 --> 05:59.576
His puny ships will never
be up to the task.

05:59.660 --> 06:02.746
We must be well prepared
for our next encounter.

06:05.916 --> 06:09.419
I know better than anyone
the power of Voltron.

06:09.503 --> 06:11.630
Haggar has my trust.

06:11.713 --> 06:13.799
We will perform her test.

06:15.092 --> 06:17.094
The witch has his ear.

06:17.177 --> 06:22.766
Keep sending our offer out to any scum
between Planet Arus and Balmera X-95-Vox.

06:22.849 --> 06:25.561
I'll capture Voltron on my own.

06:29.565 --> 06:31.608
Okay. So, when we get
there, what do you think?

06:31.609 --> 06:33.652
Do we just roll up and start blasting?

06:33.735 --> 06:36.863
Or do we land and have some kind
of public address system, like,

06:36.947 --> 06:39.700
"Attention, Galras, this is Voltron.
Turn yourselves in"?

06:41.577 --> 06:42.786
No. Blasting, right?

06:42.869 --> 06:47.416
Hunk, calm down. And, yes, blasting.

06:47.499 --> 06:50.002
It's our first big rescue mission.
He's excited.

06:50.085 --> 06:52.629
Excited to see his new girlfriend.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.256
She's not my girlfriend!

06:54.339 --> 06:57.217
She's just a rock that I met
and I admire very much.

06:58.385 --> 07:02.472
- What is it? Are we being attacked?
- No, it seems to be a distress beacon.

07:02.556 --> 07:06.059
It's coming from a nearby moon.
Apparently, a ship has lost power.

07:06.143 --> 07:09.021
- I wonder who it is.
- Whoever it is will have to wait.

07:09.104 --> 07:12.232
Shay has first priority.
We can check back on them when we're done.

07:12.316 --> 07:15.527
The Paladin Code states
that we must help all those in need.

07:15.611 --> 07:19.781
Wow! This is so cool. It's like
we're space cops on space patrol.

07:19.865 --> 07:22.451
Coran, do we have a siren
we can turn on?

07:22.534 --> 07:25.779
Uh, no, but we could record
you making a siren noise

07:25.899 --> 07:27.956
- and broadcast that to them.
- Perfect!

07:29.666 --> 07:31.501
No, not doing that.

07:39.801 --> 07:42.804
<i>Attention, damaged craft,
this is Princess Allura.</i>

07:42.888 --> 07:44.848
<i>We are coming to assist you.</i>

07:53.106 --> 07:55.901
Whoa. Nice ship.

07:59.196 --> 08:02.074
Stay aboard and try to get
as many of our systems clear

08:02.157 --> 08:04.076
of that Galra crystal energy as you can.

08:04.159 --> 08:06.161
- We'll see who hailed us.
- Yes, Princess.

08:12.501 --> 08:15.379
You don't know how glad we are
to see some friendly faces.

08:15.462 --> 08:17.422
Most folks don't want to get tangled up

08:17.506 --> 08:19.800
with anyone who's on the run
from the Galra.

08:19.883 --> 08:22.719
So, you guys are fighting the Galra?

08:22.803 --> 08:26.640
Well, I don't think Zarkon is exactly
quaking in his boots at the three of us,

08:26.723 --> 08:28.350
but we do what we can.

08:28.433 --> 08:31.603
I'm Rolo. This is Nyma,
and our cyber-unit, Beezer.

08:32.520 --> 08:33.855
Hi.

08:38.360 --> 08:41.558
- Cool robot!
- Hi! Name's Lance.

08:41.592 --> 08:43.323
Was your ship damaged in a fight?

08:44.198 --> 08:47.313
Yeah, we've really been
through it with the Galra.

08:47.314 --> 08:48.870
Parts are hard to come by.

08:48.954 --> 08:52.082
Luckily, we were able to limp
to this moon about a week ago.

08:52.165 --> 08:54.501
If you didn't pick up
our distress signal, I...

08:54.584 --> 08:57.421
We're happy to help.
I am Princess Allura of Altea,

08:57.504 --> 09:00.173
and from now on,
you won't be alone fighting the Galra.

09:01.758 --> 09:04.594
You'll have the Paladins of Voltron
by your side.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.308
Okay.

09:10.392 --> 09:14.563
- I don't think they've heard of us.
- It has been ten thousand years.

09:14.646 --> 09:20.861
Voltron? Five robot lions
that combine into this big robot... guy?

09:20.944 --> 09:23.572
Sounds impressive. I'd love to see it.

09:23.655 --> 09:26.658
- Or him. Them.
- Why don't we get to work on your ship?

09:26.742 --> 09:30.328
- I'm sure we all have places to be.
- Sure.

09:31.663 --> 09:34.416
Pretty much our whole
flaxum assembly is shot.

09:34.499 --> 09:38.128
I don't know what kind of extra parts
you carry in this rig of yours.

09:38.211 --> 09:39.713
I've never seen anything like it.

09:39.796 --> 09:42.215
I'm sure we can get you
back up and running.

09:42.299 --> 09:46.136
Give Hunk a list of what you need.
Coran can show you where to find it.

09:46.219 --> 09:47.054
Okay.

09:47.137 --> 09:51.516
We'll go with you. Don't want you to have
to carry all that yourself. Come on, guys.

09:52.809 --> 09:55.812
Uh, I don't think so.
You can just wait out here.

09:55.896 --> 09:57.606
Hunk, don't be rude.

09:57.689 --> 10:00.358
Yeah, mind your manners.
There are ladies present.

10:00.442 --> 10:01.526
Hey.

10:01.610 --> 10:04.800
Oh, I'm sorry, but does
anyone remember the last time

10:04.801 --> 10:07.991
we let our defenses down?
Someone kind of set off a bomb.

10:07.992 --> 10:10.077
Remember, Lance?
You were almost killed.

10:10.160 --> 10:11.787
Oh, yeah.

10:11.870 --> 10:15.207
Hunk's right.
Sorry, but we have to be cautious.

10:15.290 --> 10:19.294
Hey, I don't take it personal.
That's how it is out here.

10:19.377 --> 10:23.006
You've got to look out for your own.
You're doing a good job, big man.

10:23.757 --> 10:24.966
Yeah. Thanks.

10:26.343 --> 10:30.222
My planet was destroyed by the Galra
and I was taken captive.

10:30.305 --> 10:34.017
I managed to escape,
but not before I lost something.

10:34.684 --> 10:36.812
I know exactly how that feels.

10:36.895 --> 10:39.898
Well, I hope there are some parts
in here that'll fit.

10:43.735 --> 10:46.988
- You know, to get your ship moving?
- Great! Thanks.

10:47.072 --> 10:50.283
So, what can you tell us
about Zarkon's forces?

10:50.367 --> 10:52.285
Where are they concentrated?

10:52.369 --> 10:55.288
Well, his command ship sits
right in the center of the Empire.

10:55.372 --> 10:57.082
He mostly calls the shots from there

10:57.165 --> 11:00.043
and has his minions do the work,
depending on who's closest.

11:00.127 --> 11:02.629
This is the territory
of a real nasty bugger named Sendak.

11:02.712 --> 11:06.133
- Oh, we've met.
- How far are we from the center?

11:06.216 --> 11:07.676
We're way out on the fringes.

11:07.759 --> 11:11.388
Sorry to interrupt, but I think you guys
are kind of keeping Rolo from working.

11:11.471 --> 11:14.850
It's just that we're in a hurry.
A hero named Shay saved my life,

11:14.933 --> 11:17.537
and I swore I would return to do
the same for her and her people.

11:17.649 --> 11:20.939
- You understand.
- Sure. Sorry.

11:28.947 --> 11:31.449
Hunk, we're going to get going soon,

11:31.533 --> 11:34.953
but I think Rolo might have some
information that could be helpful to us.

11:35.036 --> 11:37.956
I don't trust this guy
as far as I can throw him.

11:38.039 --> 11:40.917
<i>We ought to leave him with parts
and just say, "Adiós, amigo."</i>

11:41.001 --> 11:42.460
Hey, bud! Sorry,

11:42.544 --> 11:46.423
but do you think you could hunt down
a length of thermal pipe about yay long?

11:47.173 --> 11:49.134
On the way.

11:50.385 --> 11:52.888
So, are there more freedom fighters?

11:52.971 --> 11:55.557
Any kind of organized resistance
to the Galra?

11:55.640 --> 11:57.767
Only folks who haven't been colonized yet,

11:57.851 --> 12:00.896
or the lucky few, like us,
who managed to escape somehow.

12:00.979 --> 12:02.772
Well, we're going to change all that.

12:02.856 --> 12:06.526
That's good to hear, but I've got
to warn you, it's pretty bad out there.

12:06.610 --> 12:08.945
You don't know what you're up against.

12:11.197 --> 12:14.075
I mean, there are only five of us
in the entire universe,

12:14.159 --> 12:17.037
so I guess you could say
it's kind of a big deal.

12:17.120 --> 12:19.789
I don't understand.
The lions are ships?

12:19.873 --> 12:22.125
Are they, like, flying statues
that you ride on?

12:22.208 --> 12:25.754
No, no, no. They're magic,
but also super scientific and advanced.

12:25.837 --> 12:29.174
And they fly crazy fast
and have all these incredible weapons.

12:29.257 --> 12:32.844
Really, the entire Castle is just insane.
I wish you could see it.

12:32.928 --> 12:35.805
Yes, it's too bad
we're not allowed inside.

12:35.889 --> 12:38.475
I would love a tour
from one of the knights.

12:38.558 --> 12:43.021
But I guess the big one is in charge, huh?
You have to obey his orders?

12:43.104 --> 12:46.733
Who, Hunk?
I don't have to listen to him!

12:48.860 --> 12:52.113
This place is incredible!

12:52.781 --> 12:54.908
Yeah, I guess. You get used to it.

12:54.991 --> 12:58.662
But it's so gigantic. It must take you
forever to get to your lion.

12:58.745 --> 13:00.956
Ooh, you'd be surprised.

13:03.249 --> 13:04.084
Huh?

13:11.132 --> 13:12.842
Pretty slick, right?

13:12.926 --> 13:15.929
Unbelievable!
Take me on a ride around the moon?

13:18.264 --> 13:20.392
We should probably
get back to the others.

13:20.475 --> 13:24.187
Yeah, you're right.
Maybe Keith will give me a ride.

13:24.270 --> 13:25.772
No! Hold on a second!

13:25.855 --> 13:27.815
I mean what's the
point of having the lion

13:27.816 --> 13:29.776
if you can't enjoy it, right?
Giddy-up, buddy!

13:34.781 --> 13:36.116
Oh, Lance!

13:36.199 --> 13:39.953
Let them have their fun. Thanks to you,
this thing is just about ready,

13:40.036 --> 13:42.205
so we're going to be on our way soon.

13:42.288 --> 13:44.749
Too many light years on that guy, I guess.

13:45.166 --> 13:46.209
Yeah.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.678
Begin the ritual.

13:59.889 --> 14:05.186
Druids of the four directions, join us!

14:52.817 --> 14:55.195
The Komar experiment was a success.

14:55.278 --> 14:58.114
We have gained
an entire planet's quintessence,

14:58.198 --> 15:01.034
a feat that would have
normally taken us years.

15:01.117 --> 15:02.702
Most impressive.

15:03.703 --> 15:08.208
This will revolutionize the way
we advance throughout the galaxy.

15:08.291 --> 15:11.544
Mining and colonizing planets
is a thing of the past.

15:11.628 --> 15:14.297
With this much power
available at our whim,

15:14.381 --> 15:19.469
we can now spend all of our time
hunting down and capturing Voltron.

15:22.639 --> 15:26.142
<i>Look, a kinetic spring!
Let's land over there.</i>

15:26.226 --> 15:29.187
<i>The minerals reflect off the water,
making a rainbow.</i>

15:31.356 --> 15:33.900
Wow. Is there anything you don't know?

15:41.241 --> 15:44.369
I think this thing is just
about ready for a test flight.

15:44.452 --> 15:47.747
Beezer, come co-pilot for me.
Be back in a tick.

15:48.498 --> 15:49.749
Uh...

16:00.552 --> 16:03.471
So, you want to see how fast
I can climb this tree?

16:03.555 --> 16:07.183
Aw, you are cute.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.477
Let me show you something.
Give me your hand.

16:16.609 --> 16:19.112
Whoa. This is kind of...

16:29.914 --> 16:34.294
- Nyma, what's going on?
- Sorry, Lance. Maybe we'll meet again.

16:48.766 --> 16:50.268
<i>Oh, quiznak!</i>

16:52.145 --> 16:55.148
- How many ticks have they been gone?
- I don't know.

16:55.231 --> 16:59.068
- I hope they didn't break down again.
- Something ain't right.

17:11.330 --> 17:12.582
Guys?

17:12.665 --> 17:15.001
<i>Hello? Little help?</i>

17:15.084 --> 17:19.506
Lance? Lance! Are you all right?
What's going on?

17:19.589 --> 17:22.925
Well, I'm kind of chained to a tree.

17:23.009 --> 17:23.926
I knew it!

17:24.010 --> 17:27.305
<i>And I think Nyma and Rolo
just stole the Blue Lion.</i>

17:27.387 --> 17:28.348
I knew it!

17:28.431 --> 17:31.309
<i>- Where are they?
- Uh, space?</i>

17:31.392 --> 17:34.103
Uh, I never trusted those guys,
right from the beginning!

17:34.187 --> 17:37.982
At first, it was a feeling in my gut,
but when I was replacing that pipe,

17:38.066 --> 17:41.194
the pipe was cracked, but none
of the hardware around it was damaged.

17:41.277 --> 17:42.320
<i>We get it!</i>

17:42.403 --> 17:44.572
If the thermal pipe is cracked,
then, obviously, hello,

17:44.656 --> 17:46.449
the entire assembly
should be totally roasted.

17:46.533 --> 17:47.575
Okay! We get it.

17:47.659 --> 17:50.328
We should've had to replace
the entire undercarriage of that reactor.

17:50.411 --> 17:52.830
So, right then,
I was, like, positive. Foul play.

17:52.914 --> 17:54.499
<i>Okay, we get it!</i>

18:00.129 --> 18:02.257
<i>Commander Prorok, my name is Rolo.</i>

18:02.340 --> 18:04.425
I understand you're offering a reward

18:04.426 --> 18:06.511
to anyone helping
capture the Voltron Lions.

18:06.594 --> 18:09.597
<i>That's correct.
Do you know where they are?</i>

18:09.681 --> 18:12.350
I know where the blue one is.
It's in my ship.

18:12.433 --> 18:16.688
<i>Excellent. Bring it to me
and you'll have your reward immediately.</i>

18:16.771 --> 18:20.149
Just a tick. My friends and I have
a bit of a checkered past.

18:20.233 --> 18:22.443
Some stolen merchandise
from the Galra Empire

18:22.527 --> 18:25.405
may have fallen into our possession
without us knowing about it.

18:25.488 --> 18:28.199
<i>Well, I'm sure that a full pardon
can be arranged</i>

18:28.283 --> 18:31.578
<i>for the brave souls who bring
Emperor Zarkon a Voltron Lion.</i>

18:31.661 --> 18:32.829
<i>Is that all?</i>

18:32.912 --> 18:34.998
We'll take the reward, too.

18:35.081 --> 18:36.332
<i>Of course.</i>

18:36.416 --> 18:38.376
All right.
We're on our way.

18:41.462 --> 18:43.814
I almost feel sorry
for those Voltron folks.

18:43.815 --> 18:45.383
Seemed like a nice bunch.

18:45.466 --> 18:47.927
If you're feeling guilty,
you can turn yourself in.

18:48.011 --> 18:50.597
Stealing from Zarkon
carries a life sentence.

18:51.806 --> 18:53.641
<i>They don't seem that nice.</i>

18:55.810 --> 18:59.147
Send the nearest fighter squadron
to the area of the transmission.

18:59.230 --> 19:02.525
I'm not trusting some bounty hunter
with our prize.

19:11.951 --> 19:13.036
No way.

19:14.329 --> 19:16.247
Are you sure you know what you're doing?

19:16.248 --> 19:18.166
There's no way we can
outrun those lions.

19:18.249 --> 19:21.628
Not in the open. Good thing
the Zorlar asteroid belt is right up here.

19:21.711 --> 19:23.880
I know that like the back of my hand.

19:34.182 --> 19:36.142
We'll never get through
this asteroid field!

19:36.225 --> 19:37.894
Maybe I can just bust through!

19:43.733 --> 19:46.194
Nope. That was wrong.
That was a bad idea.

19:46.277 --> 19:48.946
Keith, you're the only one
who could possibly fly through this.

19:49.030 --> 19:51.699
We need you, buddy.
Get in there and flush him out.

19:51.783 --> 19:53.951
You got it.
See you on the other side.

20:24.315 --> 20:27.443
No way. Get on the blasters.
Take him down!

20:27.527 --> 20:28.945
Copy.

20:43.876 --> 20:45.712
This kid can flat-out fly.

20:50.091 --> 20:51.801
He's gaining on you!

21:05.440 --> 21:07.859
- Blasters are offline!
- We've got to get out of here!

21:45.188 --> 21:49.442
Yeah!
Hey, Lance, I got your lion back.

21:49.525 --> 21:52.945
Thank you, Keith.
Now, can you come and unchain me?

21:53.029 --> 21:55.030
What's that? I, uh...
You're cutting out.

21:55.031 --> 21:56.365
I can't... I can't hear you.

21:56.449 --> 21:58.868
<i>Oh, come on! 
I thought we bonded.</i>

21:58.951 --> 22:01.913
<i>Keith? Buddy?
My man?</i>

22:06.709 --> 22:11.589
Since your ship really doesn't work now,
you'll have to wait here for a rescue.

22:12.256 --> 22:16.177
- Thanks for sparing our lives.
- Now that these guys are dealt with,

22:16.260 --> 22:18.930
let's get to the Balmera
and save Shay and her family.

22:19.013 --> 22:22.725
You may not believe this,
but I hope you do stop Zarkon.

22:22.809 --> 22:26.854
It's a lifetime of fighting the Galra
that led me to where I am today.

22:36.656 --> 22:40.743
All this quintessence will turn you
into the strongest,

22:40.826 --> 22:44.163
most horrifying fighter ever created.

22:44.247 --> 22:47.583
One that even Voltron
will not be able to defeat.
