03:29.303 --> 03:31.343
OK, I... I... I, uh...

03:31.423 --> 03:33.543
Whatever you heard about
this place isn't true anymore.

03:33.568 --> 03:34.991
I'm not here for that.

03:35.016 --> 03:37.696
Well, what are you skulking
around at this hour for, huh?

03:43.268 --> 03:46.168
You better watch yourself.
People don't know you.

03:46.193 --> 03:47.993
They'll shoot you soon as look at you.

03:48.041 --> 03:50.041
Point taken.

03:54.370 --> 03:56.290
You take care of yourself too, OK?

03:56.370 --> 03:58.050
Lock your door.

04:17.450 --> 04:19.570
Motherfucker.

04:23.343 --> 04:26.723
Hey. You don't think this is worth
stopping for five minutes to talk about?

04:26.748 --> 04:28.268
Five minutes, maybe... stopping, no.

04:28.293 --> 04:30.553
The guy from the other dream,
his name was Robert Dexter.

04:30.578 --> 04:31.589
Fascinating.

04:31.614 --> 04:33.903
He fell into a gorge a few days
ago. He was carrying his baby.

04:33.928 --> 04:37.092
They both died... They both
died after we dreamed it!

04:40.545 --> 04:43.770
Look, I got my own shit to
deal with, and so do you,

04:43.795 --> 04:46.235
seeing how you were just at my
house whining about your mom.

04:46.260 --> 04:48.260
Listen, if you don't give a
shit, then why are you here?

04:48.290 --> 04:50.170
Look, I had a fucked-up
nightmare about something

04:50.195 --> 04:52.435
really bad happening near
mobile homes and railroad tracks.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.740
Next thing I know, I'm on the
road. Why, I couldn't tell you.

04:55.330 --> 04:57.210
I just want this shit out of my head.

04:57.235 --> 04:58.312
You didn't dream about the sign?

04:58.530 --> 04:59.970
What sign?

05:00.057 --> 05:02.868
- "Gone Sis."
- How about when I get home

05:02.915 --> 05:05.210
I'll send you my copy of
The Interpretation of Dreams?

05:05.330 --> 05:08.330
I just don't feel right about running
off and abandoning these people.

05:08.450 --> 05:11.610
- You're so good at it, though.
- Have you ever done anything

05:11.730 --> 05:13.854
for anyone else, ever?
You weren't the only person

05:13.879 --> 05:15.799
that lost someone. I was ready to move in,

05:15.983 --> 05:18.677
get a job, be a father to her kid!

07:24.954 --> 07:26.570
What happened?

07:26.650 --> 07:29.490
Looks like a murder-suicide.

07:47.833 --> 07:49.833
Oh, Jesus Christ.

08:22.005 --> 08:23.430
What the hell are you doing?

08:23.494 --> 08:24.494
I don't know.

08:24.519 --> 08:27.213
Maybe you can use your special
powers of augury to figure it out.

08:28.164 --> 08:30.370
I told you it would fuck you up.

08:30.490 --> 08:32.929
- What?
- Turning against the moon.

08:33.105 --> 08:35.304
Come on, that was two days ago.

08:35.330 --> 08:37.490
And you've been a dick ever
since. Pull up your shirt.

08:37.625 --> 08:39.705
- Why?
- Because you've been

08:39.730 --> 08:42.370
walking around all stiff.
I want to see how bad it is.

08:49.309 --> 08:51.349
- Oh, shit.
- It's pretty much gone.

08:55.308 --> 08:56.867
Remember when you were 11,

08:57.683 --> 09:00.072
you drew on one of Nicolae's
grimoires and he was so pissed

09:00.097 --> 09:01.898
he punched you?

09:03.010 --> 09:05.450
Yeah, it's hard to forget
since he broke my nose.

09:09.050 --> 09:10.970
- He was just drunk.
- He wasn't drunk.

09:11.011 --> 09:13.211
He turned on the luna
rea one too many times.

09:13.236 --> 09:15.396
Every time, it gets harder to turn back.

09:15.549 --> 09:17.749
Your body and your mind don't
know what phase they're in.

09:17.892 --> 09:20.401
You fall apart mentally and physically.

09:20.520 --> 09:24.293
You've already started.
It's the distrugere.

09:24.340 --> 09:27.978
That's what killed him.
And it's gonna kill you too.

09:28.003 --> 09:29.723
Well, there's not a lot
I can do about it now.

09:29.874 --> 09:32.808
You can promise that you
won't turn on a bad moon again.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.210
Listen, cuz.

09:38.290 --> 09:41.890
I promise. Happy?

09:44.610 --> 09:46.370
We'll see.

09:46.816 --> 09:47.910
Cheers.

10:37.490 --> 10:39.890
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

10:39.970 --> 10:43.770
Your message last night,
it was... so sweet of you.

10:46.563 --> 10:49.203
I had an idea about your,
uh, living arrangements.

10:49.228 --> 10:50.788
Can we talk about it?

10:50.853 --> 10:54.255
Sure. After you tell me why she was here.

10:56.450 --> 10:59.530
We just bumped into each other.
She's here about the lawsuit.

10:59.745 --> 11:03.305
Maybe if you hang out outside,
you can bump into her again

11:03.330 --> 11:05.888
on her way back, hmm? Give her another hug.

11:05.913 --> 11:08.393
You were never jealous of
Marie when I was married to her.

11:14.048 --> 11:16.728
You've got to leave this place, Olivia.

11:17.067 --> 11:19.467
Why is Pryce keeping you here? Hmm?

11:19.610 --> 11:21.370
He's helping me get well.

11:23.010 --> 11:24.290
He's playing you.

11:24.370 --> 11:27.410
He's treating you like an
invalid so you'll feel powerless,

11:27.530 --> 11:29.294
so you'll depend on him.

11:29.351 --> 11:32.575
And I'm supposed to listen
to the man who despises Pryce?

11:32.600 --> 11:35.417
You're supposed to listen to
the man who's also a doctor.

11:42.530 --> 11:44.377
You're not an invalid.

11:45.170 --> 11:46.454
You're not weak.

11:47.170 --> 11:51.370
You're a beautiful, powerful woman.

12:01.710 --> 12:03.177
Hey, kid.

12:04.406 --> 12:06.606
I hired an assistant to
keep out guys like you.

12:06.818 --> 12:09.498
Tell HR to go a little huskier next time.

12:13.206 --> 12:15.686
What's going on with you and your mom?

12:16.622 --> 12:17.770
Nothing.

12:17.890 --> 12:19.890
And I want to keep it that way.

12:19.915 --> 12:23.395
She needs you, Roman. She had a close call.

12:23.896 --> 12:26.738
Whatever it is, I urge you to move past it,

12:26.763 --> 12:31.450
because when you lose
somebody, there are no do-overs.

12:32.364 --> 12:33.610
Good to know.

12:56.570 --> 12:58.490
Yes?

12:58.570 --> 13:00.770
Be right there.

13:24.710 --> 13:25.730
Hey.

13:25.810 --> 13:28.730
Hey. It's, uh, the tow truck guy, Peter.

13:28.810 --> 13:30.730
Oh, Peter. I thought it
was one of the many other

13:30.850 --> 13:32.730
tow truck guys I know.

13:32.850 --> 13:35.250
Heh. Uh, so, I called some salvage yards,

13:35.370 --> 13:37.250
I found you a cheaper brake light assembly.

13:37.370 --> 13:39.250
How much cheaper?

13:39.330 --> 13:42.130
Uh, 200 bucks. It's over in Stonycreek.

13:42.250 --> 13:44.850
Oh, yes, that is such a relief.

13:44.930 --> 13:46.930
- When will it be ready?
- Uh...

13:48.946 --> 13:52.506
Your cousin said you were stressed.
That is one major tension knot.

13:52.730 --> 13:56.170
- Sorry, what'd you say?
- Just one sec.

13:56.290 --> 13:58.290
That is what you really need.

13:58.370 --> 14:01.130
You ought to give up this, uh, monk thing.

14:01.210 --> 14:03.770
YOLO, my friend, huh? Find love.

14:06.670 --> 14:07.770
Hey.

14:07.890 --> 14:09.850
Listen, do you mind if I come with?

14:09.970 --> 14:11.610
It's like an hour's drive.

14:11.730 --> 14:13.610
Not like I've got anything better to do.

14:13.690 --> 14:16.250
And the butler here is
giving me the creeps.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.610
Yeah, I'll be over in 15.

14:20.690 --> 14:22.570
Cool. Bye.

14:27.090 --> 14:30.450
Listen to my advice.
Meeting Destiny turned me into,

14:30.570 --> 14:33.450
like, a... a different person.

14:33.737 --> 14:35.417
You're my role model, Andreas.

14:46.764 --> 14:51.425
Holding 300 patents, Godfrey Industries
has revolutionized long-distance,

14:51.450 --> 14:54.090
even trans-global, surgery.

14:55.250 --> 14:57.930
A Godfrey-Industries-trained
surgeon in Pennsylvania

14:58.010 --> 15:00.170
performed a laparoscopic stomach surgery

15:00.250 --> 15:03.770
on a 35-year-old male
in Dublin, Ireland.

15:06.350 --> 15:10.984
The surgeon controlled the incisions
by operating an external console.

15:39.328 --> 15:41.546
- What can I do?
- Uh, sorry.

15:41.650 --> 15:43.530
There weren't any calls,
so I thought I could...

15:43.555 --> 15:45.915
- What else?
- Um... th... that video, um...

15:46.130 --> 15:48.850
I watched it. I want the
walkthrough of Pryce's lab.

15:48.875 --> 15:50.875
I'll try his office again.

15:51.050 --> 15:53.410
Element of surprise.

16:19.338 --> 16:22.638
The retro-viral lottery, this is
adverse state to the polypeptide...

16:23.165 --> 16:26.345
- Yes, doctor.
- We will need time to run more tests.

16:51.416 --> 16:54.576
So, is this the first time a customer
has ever asked for a ride along?

16:54.642 --> 16:56.882
Yeah, but it's great, 'cause
I'm making her pay for lunch.

16:59.290 --> 17:02.090
So, uh, what have you been up to?

17:02.170 --> 17:05.569
Just, oh, sitting around in that house.

17:05.690 --> 17:07.810
You've been hanging out with Roman?

17:08.497 --> 17:10.650
Meaning?

17:10.675 --> 17:12.835
Meaning hanging out? I don't know.

17:13.010 --> 17:15.170
Why are you so interested in him?

17:15.290 --> 17:16.770
I'm not.

17:16.849 --> 17:18.810
Then why are you so not interested in him?

17:18.930 --> 17:21.930
I was just making conversation.

17:22.010 --> 17:24.071
Did you two date the same girl?

17:24.097 --> 17:27.416
Or... each other?

17:27.730 --> 17:31.130
We... were friends, and
we had a falling out.

17:31.828 --> 17:33.035
Over what?

17:33.060 --> 17:35.060
He's just not someone you should trust, OK?

17:35.085 --> 17:37.965
Sorry. You brought it up.

17:46.250 --> 17:47.788
Yeah?

17:48.086 --> 17:50.926
You have received a collect
call from the Hemlock County

17:51.170 --> 17:52.785
Department of Corrections.

17:53.028 --> 17:55.268
Please press 1 to accept the charges.

17:55.460 --> 17:57.619
Just... just give me a sec, OK?

18:07.770 --> 18:10.970
Hi. Oh, it's so good to hear your voice.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.543
What?

18:13.987 --> 18:15.010
No, no.

18:15.035 --> 18:16.715
Lynda. Lynda. Lynda.

18:16.850 --> 18:18.850
Everything's gonna be OK.

18:18.930 --> 18:21.650
Yeah, and she's the
best lawyer in the state.

18:23.770 --> 18:26.690
Then I'll find the best lawyer
in the whole country, OK?

18:26.770 --> 18:28.770
OK. Good.

18:34.898 --> 18:37.178
Wherever you are, I'm with you.

18:38.087 --> 18:39.620
I miss you.

18:40.770 --> 18:42.570
I love you.

19:00.730 --> 19:02.330
Everything OK?

19:02.410 --> 19:04.871
Yeah, it's just some
bullshit I had to deal with.

19:16.624 --> 19:18.664
Symphony 39 in E flat.

19:21.410 --> 19:24.530
Written in the summer of 1788,

19:24.650 --> 19:28.370
along with No. 40 in G minor

19:28.395 --> 19:30.275
and No. 41 in C major.

19:30.490 --> 19:33.370
Took Mozart three months

19:33.395 --> 19:36.475
to write one major
masterpiece and two minor ones.

19:37.130 --> 19:38.845
Three months.

19:39.410 --> 19:41.850
And you can't even deal with one teenager.

19:42.734 --> 19:45.226
I don't know what "deal with" means.

19:45.600 --> 19:48.040
But the reason I didn't kill Roman

19:48.130 --> 19:50.928
is because I couldn't find any
evidence he murdered my sister.

19:51.010 --> 19:53.154
I've known Roman all his life.

19:54.133 --> 19:56.613
He is a clinical psychopath.

19:56.638 --> 19:59.718
I'm not gonna take out some
kid just on your say-so,

19:59.743 --> 20:02.823
especially when you and your
order got your own agenda.

20:03.094 --> 20:05.240
What's your deal with
the White Tower, anyway?

20:06.090 --> 20:08.450
Why does the Order of the Dragon

20:08.530 --> 20:10.690
want to own half of a genetics company?

20:10.770 --> 20:14.583
God is diversifying his portfolio.

20:17.341 --> 20:19.901
- Any other suspects?
- Yeah.

20:21.128 --> 20:23.159
I'm going to find and kill...

20:23.274 --> 20:27.354
sorry, deal with... whoever's responsible,

20:27.608 --> 20:29.768
only when I know for sure.

20:30.629 --> 20:33.810
Whatever you think you
know about Hemlock Grove,

20:33.890 --> 20:36.780
whatever your sister might
have told you, know this:

20:37.290 --> 20:39.850
you don't know a damn thing.

20:39.970 --> 20:42.342
And when you walk out that door,

20:42.634 --> 20:45.779
you lose my protection...

20:46.850 --> 20:48.389
both financial...

20:48.810 --> 20:50.690
and otherwise.

21:07.373 --> 21:10.633
_

22:05.690 --> 22:07.110
Are you OK?

22:43.064 --> 22:45.184
Yeah. So?

22:45.530 --> 22:47.810
Did you sample the Sebzilla, Mr. Beaumont?

22:47.930 --> 22:51.690
- Oh, I most certainly did.
- Awesome, right?

22:51.817 --> 22:55.052
That shit was outlaw, yo. Who
knew gypsies could be chemists?

22:55.077 --> 22:57.997
Oh, I don't know, Richie. That's
basically like a racist assumption.

22:58.650 --> 23:01.837
Really? Name me a gypsy chemist, Dom.

23:02.201 --> 23:04.361
Why don't y'all try it again?

23:05.130 --> 23:06.650
Uh...

23:06.730 --> 23:09.490
- It was pretty intense.
- Humor me.

23:17.090 --> 23:19.930
Ow! Hehe.

23:22.250 --> 23:24.010
Ooh.

23:24.130 --> 23:27.010
- This shit stings, man.
- It's so worth it, bro.

23:27.090 --> 23:28.810
No doubt, no doubt.

23:30.930 --> 23:33.250
I realize, Mr. Beaumont, um,

23:33.370 --> 23:35.250
I've been battling depression

23:35.330 --> 23:38.210
on account of my sister's
lupus and so forth, but

23:38.330 --> 23:41.210
I honestly think my experience with
the SEB helped me get perspective.

23:41.235 --> 23:43.235
Dude, shut the fuck up for a second.

23:44.490 --> 23:46.370
You feeling anything?

23:51.370 --> 23:53.610
Yo, why ain't this shit kicked in yet?

23:53.690 --> 23:55.290
Exactly.

24:04.530 --> 24:06.410
Does a body good.

24:16.370 --> 24:18.290
- Dr. Pryce?
- Yes.

24:18.370 --> 24:20.290
Will you sign your book for me?

24:20.370 --> 24:22.650
Absolutely.

24:24.566 --> 24:26.566
- Uh, how do you know my work?
- I don't.

24:26.591 --> 24:29.551
I just wanted you to get
the service of process.

24:32.930 --> 24:35.170
- We are...
- So sorry.

24:35.250 --> 24:37.551
We know we fucked up, and
we'll make it up to you.

24:38.610 --> 24:40.330
Uh...

25:23.210 --> 25:24.910
We'll get you the money back.

25:26.866 --> 25:28.266
See that you do.

25:39.810 --> 25:42.010
I obviously have a lot of anger,

25:42.130 --> 25:44.570
but I'm trying to let it
go, because it's toxic.

25:44.650 --> 25:48.290
Truth is, Norman and I should
have broken up years ago.

25:51.839 --> 25:54.759
Just take care of him. He's a good man.

25:55.130 --> 25:58.370
That's very mature and rational of you.

25:58.450 --> 26:00.450
It's the right thing to do.

26:02.351 --> 26:05.271
So... I forgive you,

26:05.570 --> 26:07.890
and I hope you have a good life.

26:07.970 --> 26:10.209
Forgive me?

26:10.234 --> 26:13.754
Uh, for what, if you don't mind me asking?

26:13.905 --> 26:15.025
Norman left me for you.

26:15.161 --> 26:17.361
After your marriage broke up. After.

26:17.574 --> 26:20.308
And you don't think that you
sleeping with him for a decade

26:20.333 --> 26:22.540
maybe had a little
something to do with that?

26:22.657 --> 26:26.402
If I had wanted Norman to leave you
earlier, trust me, he would have.

26:26.427 --> 26:28.427
Oh, so you held back?

26:28.720 --> 26:31.721
You were morally superior
holding off on wrecking our home.

26:31.746 --> 26:34.143
Go home, Marie.

26:34.690 --> 26:36.207
Or what?

26:36.639 --> 26:39.119
I already lost everything...
my marriage, my child.

26:39.144 --> 26:40.852
What are you gonna do to me?

26:41.703 --> 26:43.583
I have dead daughters too.

26:44.188 --> 26:46.632
Get over it. Get out of my house.

26:46.854 --> 26:50.117
Maybe that's all I have, are
memories of my dead daughter.

26:50.771 --> 26:53.250
But what do you have, Olivia?

26:53.370 --> 26:55.530
A boyfriend who's gonna leave you

26:55.555 --> 26:57.875
when he realizes what a
terrible person you are.

26:58.090 --> 27:00.250
A dead daughter of your own... a sweet girl

27:00.275 --> 27:02.435
who always loved you, but
you treated her like a freak.

27:02.460 --> 27:05.404
And a disturbed son who
hates your fucking guts.

27:07.730 --> 27:10.090
And if no one else has
anything else to add,

27:10.115 --> 27:13.001
then I' happy to say we're
finishing up early for once.

27:13.026 --> 27:16.426
- I have something to add.
- Yes?

27:16.850 --> 27:19.530
What have you got hidden in the basement?

27:22.570 --> 27:26.370
Time machine? Meth lab? Alien autopsy?

27:26.513 --> 27:28.553
You're welcome to come down
anytime and look around yourself.

27:28.930 --> 27:31.090
I did. A couple of hours ago.

27:31.170 --> 27:34.850
I got out of the elevator, and
I saw you and Miss Chernobyl

27:34.930 --> 27:38.490
walking down the hall. You
turned the corner, then... poof.

27:38.610 --> 27:40.890
- Gone.
- You were spying on him?

27:41.010 --> 27:43.250
That's the only way of getting
information out of this guy.

27:43.330 --> 27:45.090
Sidebar.

27:51.383 --> 27:52.983
You're flailing.

27:53.330 --> 27:55.210
If you came up with the votes
to get rid of me, I would

27:55.330 --> 27:57.250
walk out with the entire
research department.

27:57.275 --> 28:00.435
All you'd own is 50% of an empty
building in a bullshit town.

28:00.610 --> 28:02.450
Bitchin' loft space.

28:02.475 --> 28:05.155
You sure you want to
talk about locked doors?

28:05.370 --> 28:07.290
Hidden rooms with their secret contents?

28:07.315 --> 28:10.163
And this from a man who
literally lives in a glass house.

28:11.650 --> 28:15.410
You might want to remember who
signed the baby's death certificate.

28:15.530 --> 28:17.890
Now, I'm no lawyer, but that sounds

28:17.970 --> 28:19.930
kind of malpractice-y, no?

28:20.010 --> 28:23.530
A not-so-gray area as to its legality.

28:23.610 --> 28:25.570
See you at the proxy fights.

28:31.770 --> 28:32.930
Oh, fuck him!

28:32.955 --> 28:35.875
We'll own him once he
realizes how much he needs us.

28:36.050 --> 28:38.850
Do you not remember what happened
when I gave Olivia her first treatment?

28:38.970 --> 28:40.890
She almost fractured my skull.

28:41.010 --> 28:42.890
I was begging in slurred
words for her not to kill me.

28:42.915 --> 28:45.235
Now, until Roman's need is unbearable,

28:45.260 --> 28:46.731
he will not accept what we show him.

28:46.756 --> 28:48.876
He will be angry and he
will take it out on us.

28:48.901 --> 28:51.361
You and I both have our reasons
to keep peace with Olivia.

28:51.502 --> 28:54.868
I'm quite happy with how she's kept
her side of the pact over the years.

28:54.893 --> 28:57.333
But at heart, she and her boy

28:57.358 --> 29:01.118
have no more control over
their appetites than angry dogs.

29:01.599 --> 29:03.719
I am trying the leash.

29:04.050 --> 29:07.458
Some dogs need to be put down.

29:12.330 --> 29:15.490
- Centrifuge malfunction.
- Come with me.

29:22.010 --> 29:23.663
I have a new project.

29:24.844 --> 29:26.204
I like new.

29:31.690 --> 29:34.379
Research tool. An enzyme inhibitor

29:34.450 --> 29:36.330
to knock out clotting factor nine.

29:36.450 --> 29:39.259
As soon as possible, and off the books.

29:39.650 --> 29:42.570
The effect of this drug
on an organism would be

29:42.595 --> 29:44.364
to induce acute hemophilia.

29:44.663 --> 29:46.967
Like an atom bomb going
off in the bloodstream.

29:50.001 --> 29:53.010
I brought you here because
of your hematology expertise.

29:53.035 --> 29:55.435
I am just questioning its application.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.060
Then stop questioning.

29:58.718 --> 30:00.843
Makes life so much easier.

30:01.570 --> 30:04.010
I need it by the end of the week.

30:04.090 --> 30:05.810
Research tool.

30:18.890 --> 30:20.490
Who's Lynda?

30:25.290 --> 30:26.770
It's my mom.

30:28.890 --> 30:30.270
Is she OK?

30:31.688 --> 30:33.208
She's in jail.

30:34.721 --> 30:36.401
What for?

30:36.770 --> 30:38.650
Some stuff she didn't do.

30:38.770 --> 30:40.854
Some stuff she did do.

30:40.922 --> 30:43.082
All those years on the road,

30:43.107 --> 30:45.027
she did some things that weren't so smart.

30:45.337 --> 30:47.377
But I did too, so...

30:49.771 --> 30:52.331
She doesn't deserve this.

30:52.810 --> 30:54.690
I'm gonna get her out.

30:56.834 --> 30:59.194
Well, it sounds like you're
doing everything you can.

31:06.907 --> 31:09.307
You know what we should
do when we get back?

31:09.850 --> 31:11.087
What?

31:11.810 --> 31:14.386
A tarot reading. Give us some guidance.

31:14.411 --> 31:16.011
What?

31:18.298 --> 31:20.678
Oh, wait, you weren't kidding.

31:20.703 --> 31:24.803
Oh, no, yeah... I know most card
readers are idiots or crooks,

31:24.828 --> 31:27.708
but my cousin, Destiny, she
actually knows what she's doing.

31:28.210 --> 31:29.930
Destiny?

31:31.690 --> 31:33.170
What?

31:35.271 --> 31:36.551
Hey.

31:38.749 --> 31:40.049
Destiny?

31:49.690 --> 31:51.090
So?

31:53.250 --> 31:55.490
Oh, I wasn't lying.

31:55.515 --> 31:58.675
This isn't some sort of "get
the girl back to my place" thing.

32:01.459 --> 32:04.479
Peter, do you really think I
came here for a tarot reading?

32:47.210 --> 32:49.650
Your eyes are...

32:49.730 --> 32:51.330
I know.

32:53.250 --> 32:54.730
You OK?

32:54.810 --> 32:58.090
Yes. Totally. Um...

32:58.170 --> 33:01.250
I just get emotional sometimes.

33:01.330 --> 33:03.290
It doesn't mean anything.

33:12.753 --> 33:15.113
I love this mattress.

33:15.434 --> 33:18.234
My ex had this stupid futon.

33:18.259 --> 33:20.419
It felt like it had dead cats in it.

33:24.244 --> 33:28.124
Great. Now I'm the girl who's talking
about her ex while in bed with...

33:31.431 --> 33:33.031
It's fine.

33:35.810 --> 33:37.475
Do you still talk to yours?

33:38.510 --> 33:39.850
No.

33:41.548 --> 33:43.108
That bad, huh?

33:47.010 --> 33:48.610
She died.

33:52.710 --> 33:54.270
Oh, God.

33:57.704 --> 34:00.424
- Maybe this was a bad idea...
- No.

34:00.770 --> 34:02.650
No.

34:06.969 --> 34:08.529
I want you to stay.

34:27.248 --> 34:29.989
- Mommy, can I have a treat?
- Yes, inside.

34:30.116 --> 34:32.476
- Can I have two?
- Nice try, but no.

34:41.857 --> 34:43.170
You live here, ma'am?

34:43.290 --> 34:44.964
Is everything all right, officer?

34:44.989 --> 34:48.409
We got a call. Prowler in the area.

34:48.435 --> 34:50.594
Just lock your doors and set
your alarm. You should be fine.

34:50.620 --> 34:52.594
OK. Thank you.

35:21.281 --> 35:25.661
It's not illegal to be a fierce
and ravishing warrior goddess.

35:26.070 --> 35:28.650
I was born this way, you
motherfucking bitches!

35:28.770 --> 35:30.730
We're not arresting you for being anything.

35:30.850 --> 35:33.577
We're arresting you for taking a
dump in the middle of Hemlock Ave.

35:33.602 --> 35:35.922
- Sleep it off, Jackie.
- This is discrimination.

35:37.730 --> 35:39.910
Don't fucking touch me!
Get your hands off me.

35:41.316 --> 35:42.996
He still in there?

35:43.021 --> 35:44.217
Yep.

35:44.663 --> 35:46.943
You don't find him weird?

35:47.320 --> 35:49.480
Weirder than our last sheriff?

35:49.781 --> 35:51.661
The guy who lost his
mind and blew himself up

35:51.686 --> 35:53.566
with a bomb he was
building in his basement?

35:53.591 --> 35:55.551
I'm just saying, he's making us look bad,

35:55.576 --> 35:57.656
staying so late all the time.

35:58.090 --> 36:00.170
I mean, what's he doing in there, anyway?

36:07.180 --> 36:09.815
_

38:09.010 --> 38:11.930
Uh, the white mask from the dreams.

38:11.955 --> 38:13.498
That guy. I... I think...

38:13.824 --> 38:15.944
he killed the family, the one at the gorge,

38:16.330 --> 38:18.210
and he killed a woman
and her kid last night,

38:18.330 --> 38:20.210
and... and the kid on the tricycle,

38:20.235 --> 38:22.555
- he's gonna run him over.
- So what are you saying?

38:22.580 --> 38:25.340
A psycho in a freak mask is
walking around killing people?

38:25.415 --> 38:27.375
Yeah, but he's making
them look like accidents.

38:27.438 --> 38:29.078
Why?

38:29.103 --> 38:31.023
I don't know. That's why I'm
standing in the last place

38:31.048 --> 38:32.536
that either of us want to be right now.

38:32.773 --> 38:35.113
The kid on the tricycle, he
was looking up at something.

38:35.138 --> 38:37.598
- If we could figure out what that was.
- What do you want?

38:41.651 --> 38:44.331
All of last year, Destiny kept telling me

38:44.356 --> 38:47.103
to pay attention to the
dreams, and I didn't.

38:48.450 --> 38:50.890
That's why everything went bad.

38:50.970 --> 38:52.530
Well, if you're trying to

38:52.610 --> 38:55.850
make up for skipping out on me
like a coward, then duly noted.

38:57.597 --> 38:59.457
I was a coward.

39:03.530 --> 39:05.450
It wasn't even about the
people who trashed my trailer.

39:05.475 --> 39:07.826
I just didn't want anything
to remind me of Letha,

39:08.413 --> 39:10.453
of everything that I lost.

39:12.378 --> 39:14.278
You were my only friend.

39:14.570 --> 39:17.410
And I shouldn't have
abandoned you, and I'm sorry.

39:20.250 --> 39:21.730
All right.

39:23.044 --> 39:24.324
Peter.

39:28.452 --> 39:32.492
The thing the kid was looking
at... It was a plane...

39:32.715 --> 39:35.115
old-fashioned, biplane, whatever,

39:35.450 --> 39:37.770
pulling a green banner, flying really low.

39:40.638 --> 39:42.238
Good luck.

40:04.696 --> 40:06.376
I got you a drink.

40:14.772 --> 40:16.332
Let me.

40:29.974 --> 40:32.494
Wow. You're thirsty.

40:35.010 --> 40:37.185
The things on your hands are dirty.

40:37.625 --> 40:39.945
I can make new ones out of Mom's t-shirt.

40:56.683 --> 40:58.103
I can help.

40:59.292 --> 41:00.852
Look.

41:09.210 --> 41:13.237
The doctor said he could cut it
off. Mom doesn't want to pay for it.

41:13.369 --> 41:16.213
I like it anyway. It's my toe.

41:35.131 --> 41:36.811
I named my toe.

41:37.056 --> 41:38.736
We could name your fingers.

41:43.677 --> 41:45.517
This one's Shorty.

41:45.682 --> 41:47.562
No, Stumpy.

41:49.184 --> 41:51.604
This one's... Bloody.

41:52.074 --> 41:54.074
This one is Gooey.

41:54.170 --> 41:57.630
These two are Squishy.

42:05.576 --> 42:07.233
What's going on?

42:08.682 --> 42:10.109
Oh.

42:11.370 --> 42:14.530
You cannot do this, Olivia.

42:14.650 --> 42:17.010
You can't text me to drop everything,

42:17.130 --> 42:19.650
have me rush over, and then ignore me!

42:19.770 --> 42:22.530
I'm not doing it anymore,
not after everything

42:22.610 --> 42:24.730
that I have been through!

42:26.950 --> 42:28.770
Baby, what's wrong?

42:33.730 --> 42:37.090
No. No, no, no, no.

42:37.170 --> 42:39.690
Don't cry.

42:39.715 --> 42:42.395
Sweetheart. I love you.

42:49.470 --> 42:50.910
Don't cry.

42:53.984 --> 42:56.304
I'm planning something special.

42:56.619 --> 42:59.139
No rush, no pressure.

42:59.265 --> 43:02.225
I got these open tickets

43:02.250 --> 43:03.925
to Buzios.

43:03.976 --> 43:06.536
It's this town in Brazil.

43:06.561 --> 43:09.803
The most beautiful beach in the world.

43:10.666 --> 43:12.986
I went there in college.

43:13.011 --> 43:15.891
Somehow I never made it back.

43:15.916 --> 43:19.196
Well, you know, Marie, she
was never much of a traveler.

43:19.810 --> 43:21.690
I've got to pee.
