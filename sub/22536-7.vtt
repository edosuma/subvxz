00:02.030 --> 00:03.918
Previously on
crisis:

00:03.930 --> 00:05.158
Taking me and these
two patients,

00:05.170 --> 00:07.832
It's kidnapping.

00:07.840 --> 00:09.262
Widener:
Anyth/hg on c/arenbach yet?

00:09.270 --> 00:11.135
No, nothing yet.
Well, keep listening.

00:11.140 --> 00:13.961
But it'd be an awful lot easier
if you'd stop shaking the board.

00:13.980 --> 00:16.778
And before you tell me that
gibson's the one doing

00:16.780 --> 00:18.304
All the shaking, let me
just point out the fact

00:18.310 --> 00:20.039
That he's nothing
but a tiny little piece

00:20.050 --> 00:21.119
That's lost his way.

00:21.120 --> 00:23.509
You got to help me!

00:23.520 --> 00:24.782
Help me stay awake.

00:24.790 --> 00:26.212
I dreamed of those people.

00:26.220 --> 00:27.881
They're gonna
make me kill again.

00:27.890 --> 00:28.959
Who is?

00:28.960 --> 00:31.451
He is.

00:31.460 --> 00:34.452
Comm: _
Enemy neutralized.
The soldiers are secure.

00:38.900 --> 00:40.322
We need to figure out
what gibson has

00:40.340 --> 00:41.466
To do with those soldiers.

00:41.470 --> 00:43.165
Do you want to trust me?
Yeah.

00:43.170 --> 00:45.468
(fire alarm chirping)
who's responsible for this?

00:45.470 --> 00:49.179
It was me.
Punishment begins tomorrow
morning at 6:00 a.M.

00:49.180 --> 00:51.307
This guy is better than us.
Smarter than us.

00:51.310 --> 00:52.675
If he wants to send
a kid home in a bag,

00:52.680 --> 00:54.170
There's nothing
we can do about it.

00:54.180 --> 00:56.717
What is he doing?
Finley: Let's ask him.

00:58.220 --> 00:59.244
(phone ringing)

01:01.360 --> 01:04.318
(phone ringing)

01:11.830 --> 01:13.320
Boss, you sure about this?

01:13.340 --> 01:14.591
When they pick up that phone,

01:14.600 --> 01:17.865
You just keep
bouncing the signal.

01:17.870 --> 01:20.134
(line ringing)

01:21.680 --> 01:23.272
(phone ringing)

01:23.280 --> 01:25.601
Agent dunn.

01:25.610 --> 01:28.010
You have 30 seconds.
(stopwatch ticking)

01:28.020 --> 01:30.011
(distorted): What do you know
about the hit squad?

01:30.020 --> 01:32.079
There's evidence
they work here.

01:32.090 --> 01:33.546
In this country.

01:33.560 --> 01:36.609
Yes, I saw that
storage unit, too.

01:36.630 --> 01:39.258
Tell me something I don't know.

01:39.260 --> 01:41.194
25 seconds.

01:41.200 --> 01:42.849
What do we get if we do?

01:42.870 --> 01:44.929
Well, you get to keep me
on the phone.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.420
Isn't that what you want?
To get inside my head?

01:46.440 --> 01:47.930
20 seconds.

01:47.940 --> 01:50.898
Cia director widener,
we know he's involved.

01:50.910 --> 01:53.208
Tell me something I don't know.

01:53.210 --> 01:56.031
Francis gibson.

01:59.950 --> 02:02.475
What about him?

02:02.490 --> 02:04.640
We know he's i_nvolved.
He's ex-cna.

02:04.650 --> 02:07.039
Yes. We asked him about that.

02:07.060 --> 02:08.482
Several times.

02:08.490 --> 02:09.479
Now he's in the other room

02:09.490 --> 02:11.879
Crying with his daughter.

02:11.890 --> 02:13.619
Ten seconds.

02:16.660 --> 02:18.321
If you took those kids

02:18.330 --> 02:20.389
To use their parents...

02:21.440 --> 02:23.738
...Use us.

02:23.740 --> 02:26.061
We can help you.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.935
Five seconds.

02:28.940 --> 02:32.649
Station orange c0239gh.

02:32.650 --> 02:35.016
Where did you hear that code?

02:35.020 --> 02:37.909
Which time?

02:37.920 --> 02:40.582
He heard the broadcast
from two locations.

02:40.590 --> 02:43.479
We can triangulate the signal
and get a fix on station orange.

02:46.630 --> 02:48.257
I assume the first time
you heard that code was

02:48.260 --> 02:50.854
In the basement of the pakistani
embassy three days ago.

02:50.870 --> 02:53.623
At what other time
and place did you hear it?

02:53.640 --> 02:56.689
We can work together.

02:56.710 --> 02:58.928
Not without the where and when.

02:58.940 --> 03:00.168
Good-bye.

03:00.180 --> 03:02.205
Ground floor of a building

03:02.210 --> 03:04.701
At 227 h street.

03:04.710 --> 03:07.543
38 hours ago.

03:07.550 --> 03:11.077
You want to work together?

03:13.220 --> 03:16.212
Use you instead of the parents?

03:16.230 --> 03:18.380
You will do something for me.

03:18.390 --> 03:19.618
If you succeed,

03:19.630 --> 03:21.154
I will release a hostage.

03:21.160 --> 03:24.049
If you fail, a hostage dies.

03:25.400 --> 03:27.789
I will call you again
in four hours.

03:27.800 --> 03:31.804
If you tell anyone,
you've already failed.

03:44.050 --> 03:45.642
Wakie, wakie, wakie!

03:45.650 --> 03:47.686
It is 6:00 a.M.

03:47.690 --> 03:49.317
And you are on the clock.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.957
Now!

03:54.260 --> 03:56.592
(high-pitched, steady ringing)

04:00.270 --> 04:01.897
Four lines.

04:01.900 --> 04:04.607
Arms width apart!

04:04.610 --> 04:07.170
Four lines! Now!

04:17.420 --> 04:19.615
Readit

04:22.290 --> 04:24.929
"my father is the president
of the United States.

04:24.930 --> 04:27.023
"he is the most
powerful man alive

04:27.030 --> 04:28.554
"and he cannot find me.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.721
"he cannot save me.

04:30.730 --> 04:33.119
"if these men wanted to kill me,

04:33.140 --> 04:34.892
My father could not stop them."

04:34.900 --> 04:37.368
Read it again.

04:37.370 --> 04:40.430
"my father is the president
of the United States..."

04:40.440 --> 04:42.908
"my father commands an aircraft
carrier battle group

04:42.910 --> 04:44.741
"with thousands
of sailors and marines.

04:44.750 --> 04:47.048
"my father cannot find me.

04:47.050 --> 04:48.779
My father cannot save me...."

04:48.780 --> 04:50.441
"my father represents
the people's republic of china.

04:50.450 --> 04:52.714
"my father cannot find me.

04:52.720 --> 04:54.711
My father cannot save me..."

04:54.720 --> 04:57.052
"through insider trading
my father has amassed a fortune.

04:57.060 --> 04:58.584
"he has paid off
judges and politicians

04:58.590 --> 05:00.228
To stay out of jail."

05:00.230 --> 05:03.097
"my father cannot find me.
My father cannot save me.

05:03.100 --> 05:04.624
"if these men wanted to kill me,

05:04.630 --> 05:06.325
My father could
not stop them..."

05:06.340 --> 05:09.662
"my mother cannot find me.
My mother cannot save me..."

05:09.670 --> 05:11.900
"my parents cannot find me.
My parents cannot save me..."

05:11.910 --> 05:14.970
"my mother cannot find me.
My mother cannot save me..."

05:14.980 --> 05:17.437
(all reading)

05:17.450 --> 05:20.374
How long will you
make them do that?

05:21.350 --> 05:24.114
Until they believe it.

05:24.120 --> 05:26.680
(all reading)

05:36.600 --> 05:39.068
I don't think your
daughter ever will.

05:40.030 --> 05:42.669
Believe that you can't help her.

05:42.670 --> 05:44.490
I've seen the way
she looks at you now.

05:44.510 --> 05:46.239
That's what you wanted, right?

05:52.550 --> 05:54.472
Where are you

05:54.480 --> 05:55.845
At triangulating
those signals

05:55.850 --> 05:58.683
Agent finley gave us?
Nearly there.

05:58.690 --> 06:00.180
Where is that?

06:00.190 --> 06:03.557
Those two signals
intersect at this location.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.551
Lock on that signal.

06:06.960 --> 06:07.881
That's it.

06:07.900 --> 06:11.199
That's station orange.

06:11.200 --> 06:13.259
Can you open it up?

06:24.180 --> 06:27.274
Comm:
We ’re //7.

06:41.730 --> 06:43.197
I cut trackers
out of them both.

06:43.200 --> 06:44.519
Then we're good to go.

06:44.530 --> 06:47.067
Fbi and military bands
are chatter-free.

06:47.070 --> 06:48.867
No eyes in the sky, either.

06:48.870 --> 06:50.838
Hawkins goes with you.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.501
How you doing, hawkins?

06:52.510 --> 06:54.034
Quiet type, I guess.

06:54.040 --> 06:56.531
You take him and this file

06:56.550 --> 06:57.676
To this news station.

06:57.680 --> 06:59.045
And then you get
out of there.

06:59.050 --> 07:01.939
Thayer goes with me
back to gibson.

07:01.950 --> 07:04.817
You're going on the news,
sergeant hawkins.

07:06.790 --> 07:09.509
You're gonna be famous.

07:19.470 --> 07:21.062
Finley:
If we tell o/sen,

07:21.070 --> 07:22.435
And he shuts us down,

07:22.440 --> 07:24.465
A kid dies.

07:24.470 --> 07:28.065
You believe he'd kill a kid?

07:28.080 --> 07:29.308
I have no reason not to.

07:29.310 --> 07:31.369
And when the next call comes in

07:31.380 --> 07:34.201
And he tells us
what he wants us to do...

07:34.220 --> 07:36.245
Where do we draw the line?

07:36.250 --> 07:37.717
The more we do for
the kidnappers,

07:37.720 --> 07:39.449
The more we find
out about them.

07:39.460 --> 07:42.315
I understand how we have
to tell ourselves that

07:42.320 --> 07:45.551
_ So we're not
just two more par...

07:45.560 --> 07:48.290
People...

07:48.300 --> 07:50.427
Two more people doing
what that voice

07:50.430 --> 07:51.897
On the phone tells them to do.

07:51.900 --> 07:53.299
But it's true.

07:53.300 --> 07:54.938
Everything they tell
us to do reveals

07:54.940 --> 07:56.430
A little more
about who they are.

07:56.440 --> 07:57.896
But that's not what I asked.

07:57.910 --> 08:00.868
What I asked was "what would
we be willing to do?"

08:03.140 --> 08:05.005
Where's the line, finley?

08:05.010 --> 08:07.899
The line?

08:07.920 --> 08:09.774
We keep going until one of us

08:09.790 --> 08:12.281
Says stop, okay?

08:12.290 --> 08:14.485
Okay.

08:15.820 --> 08:18.550
How much time
until the next call?

08:20.930 --> 08:23.353
A little over three hours.

08:28.100 --> 08:31.365
Nine deaths,
all in the last 18 months.

08:31.370 --> 08:33.258
Two shootings unsolved.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.874
The rest-- car wrecks, fire,

08:35.880 --> 08:37.438
Drowning, falls.

08:41.050 --> 08:42.938
The kidnapper led you here.

08:42.950 --> 08:44.713
Agent dunn?

08:46.690 --> 08:47.941
Agent dunn?

08:47.960 --> 08:49.484
Uh, y-y-yes.

08:49.490 --> 08:50.980
We discovered this while...
(clears throat)

08:50.990 --> 08:53.629
...Attempting
to trap the kidnappers.

08:53.630 --> 08:56.497
I understand that the kidnapper,
who you lost, led you here.

08:56.500 --> 08:58.127
But what does this have
to do with the cia?

08:58.130 --> 08:59.563
Finley:
That one.

08:59.570 --> 09:00.821
He was on that video

09:00.840 --> 09:02.330
I saw at the cia.

09:02.340 --> 09:03.466
He and his family were massacred

09:03.470 --> 09:04.562
By those soldiers.

09:04.570 --> 09:06.629
That video you
saw for maybe

09:06.640 --> 09:08.801
Ten, 15 seconds?

09:08.810 --> 09:10.004
He was on that video, sir.

09:10.010 --> 09:11.170
A parent died getting it

09:11.180 --> 09:12.738
Out of the cia
for the kidnapper.

09:12.750 --> 09:14.069
I know what I saw.

09:14.080 --> 09:16.378
And I see a lot
of you two lately.

09:16.390 --> 09:17.345
Aren't you assigned
to the parents?

09:17.350 --> 09:19.215
Olsen:
They are.

09:19.220 --> 09:20.414
But their investigations
led them to the storage unit

09:20.420 --> 09:22.411
And this information.

09:22.420 --> 09:23.910
What of the parents?
They're all buttoned up?

09:23.930 --> 09:25.329
We don't have to worry
about the kidnapper

09:25.330 --> 09:26.820
Using them to launch any more

09:26.830 --> 09:29.253
Attacks?

09:29.260 --> 09:33.094
Yes, sir, the parents
are all "buttoned up."

09:40.170 --> 09:43.207
Comm:
Staﬁon orange code
ls flea V/7y encrypted

09:43.210 --> 09:46.179
So far I'm only into today's
mission file and just barely.

09:46.180 --> 09:49.741
Filter a search
for "clarenbach" or "chemist."

09:49.750 --> 09:52.048
Nothing on "clarenbach,"
but keyword "chemist"

09:52.050 --> 09:53.210
Pings back to an address

09:53.220 --> 09:55.051
Out in anacostia.
Good, good.

09:55.060 --> 09:57.984
Open a line out for me
to special agent dunn.

09:59.230 --> 10:00.583
These are the feds.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.919
We're talking directly
to them now.

10:01.930 --> 10:03.625
No, now I am talking
directly to you.

10:03.630 --> 10:05.598
And I'm telling you
to open a line.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.465
Opening a line now.

10:07.470 --> 10:09.199
Use that code to figure out

10:09.200 --> 10:12.408
Whatever else widener's hiding.

10:12.410 --> 10:15.732
Even bouncing it, I can
only guarantee 15 seconds

10:15.740 --> 10:18.379
Considering where they are.

10:19.650 --> 10:22.141
Do it.

10:22.150 --> 10:25.608
Olsen:
Nine deaths, all in the last 18
months. Two shootings unsolved.

10:25.620 --> 10:27.281
(cell phone ringing)

10:27.290 --> 10:28.882
I need to see that tape.

10:28.890 --> 10:31.620
It's turned up twice in
relation to this kidnapping.

10:31.630 --> 10:33.655
My agency is doing
everything in its power

10:33.660 --> 10:35.252
To trace our connection
to that kidnapping,

10:35.260 --> 10:38.661
But I cannot
show you that tape.

10:38.670 --> 10:40.865
Agent dunn?

10:42.240 --> 10:44.367
Just checking
on the parents, sir.

10:50.110 --> 10:53.409
(distorted):
The cia is holding a man
at 836 north

10:53.420 --> 10:55.741
Humphrey avenue. You are to
get this man and bring him

10:55.750 --> 10:57.809
To the east capitol street
parking garage, fifth floor,

10:57.820 --> 10:59.742
Green section.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.785
You have exactly
three hours to do this for me.

11:01.790 --> 11:03.257
What will you do to him?

11:03.260 --> 11:06.252
Now you have
less than three hours.

11:06.260 --> 11:07.750
(phone beeps)

11:22.710 --> 11:25.702
Hey, susie cakes.

11:28.980 --> 11:30.379
I'll meet you in the car.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.278
Want help with this?

11:32.290 --> 11:33.780
No, I got it.

11:42.030 --> 11:43.327
What are you doing here?

11:43.330 --> 11:46.367
Well, my daughter's
been kidnapped.

11:46.370 --> 11:50.192
_ Her mom is a fed.
I'm just a concerned parent.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.563
You look great.

11:51.570 --> 11:53.208
Why did we ever split up?

11:53.210 --> 11:55.337
How much do you want?

11:55.340 --> 11:58.400
This time?

11:58.410 --> 11:59.900
More than you can afford.

11:59.920 --> 12:03.048
This time you're gonna have
to ask your sister

12:03.050 --> 12:05.382
For some help.

12:05.390 --> 12:08.882
You look busy. I'll be in touch.

12:12.590 --> 12:15.058
Dunn: There must be someone
Important being held In there.

12:31.950 --> 12:33.508
Dunn:
Female, mid-30$.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.114
You see what's
in that bag?

12:36.120 --> 12:38.145
Yeah, looks like takeout.

12:54.470 --> 12:57.132
Male, mid-30$,
sidearm under his coat.

13:00.810 --> 13:02.778
Finley, they look
like feds to you?

13:02.780 --> 13:06.079
Yeah. I'm guessing the kind
that work out at langley.

13:06.080 --> 13:07.672
How much time
do we have left?

13:09.920 --> 13:11.785
You get the sandwiches
he wanted?

13:11.790 --> 13:13.712
Yes, I got
the sandwiches he wanted.

13:13.720 --> 13:15.415
Is he still
in the basement?

13:15.420 --> 13:18.059
No, I'm taking a break.

13:18.060 --> 13:21.359
Oh, excellent.
I'm starving.

13:29.570 --> 13:32.903
Look what the guards forgot.

13:32.910 --> 13:34.559
It's a bluetooth
to all the speakers.

13:34.580 --> 13:36.775
Should we?

13:36.780 --> 13:38.304
Yeah.

13:38.850 --> 13:40.499
(music plays)

13:40.520 --> 13:42.943
It's homecoming, bitches!

13:42.950 --> 13:44.611
Put your hands up!

13:44.620 --> 13:47.316
and you know what it is,
and you know what it is

13:47.320 --> 13:50.483
and you know what it is,
and you know what it is...

13:50.490 --> 13:52.185
Where is it?!

13:52.190 --> 13:55.193
What are you doing?

13:55.200 --> 13:56.451
It's all good.

13:56.460 --> 13:57.791
Are you high?

13:57.800 --> 14:00.462
Shh. It's just music.

14:00.470 --> 14:02.335
You remember music,
right?

14:02.340 --> 14:05.366
tip the bartender, then you
know I'm headed to the floor

14:05.370 --> 14:07.008
dj playin' t.I.P.,
I like my beat down low...

14:07.010 --> 14:08.534
Francis:
Hold it.

14:08.540 --> 14:09.939
Give 'em 30 minutes.

14:09.950 --> 14:12.248
Then shut it down
and line them up again.

14:13.350 --> 14:15.648
And send two men
to the service entrance.

14:15.650 --> 14:17.971
Koz is back.

14:17.990 --> 14:20.879
yeah, I knew it, baby,
love it or hate it...

14:22.520 --> 14:25.284
It's homecoming, bitches.

14:25.290 --> 14:28.589
That charmer back at hq,
that's amber's father?

14:30.630 --> 14:32.359
Yeah.

14:32.370 --> 14:34.895
I'm not thinking about him
today and neither should you.

14:34.900 --> 14:37.664
You want help with him,
just ask.

14:37.670 --> 14:39.706
Not thinking about him today.
Understood.

14:39.710 --> 14:41.974
(sirens wailing)

14:48.850 --> 14:51.546
Hey...
Hey.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.488
Gas leak?

14:54.490 --> 14:58.119
Yeah. Can't you smell it?
This whole block could go.

14:59.190 --> 15:02.557
We got
a gas leak, guys.

15:04.160 --> 15:06.720
67355
pres/dente.

15:07.900 --> 15:11.097
You don't want to dance with me,
trust me.

15:11.110 --> 15:12.839
I'm in the millq way

15:12.840 --> 15:15.673
you want me down on earth,
but I am up in space

15:15.680 --> 15:17.204
you're so damn hard
to please

15:17.210 --> 15:19.678
we gotta kill this switch

15:19.680 --> 15:23.047
you're from the '705,
but I'm a '905 chick

15:23.050 --> 15:24.677
I love it...

15:25.590 --> 15:26.909
He's the president's son.

15:26.920 --> 15:29.252
Do you even get
the time of day from him

15:29.260 --> 15:31.558
When we're not in this place?

15:31.560 --> 15:33.687
It's probably just
the stockholm syndrome.

15:33.700 --> 15:37.227
I think that's where
you identify with
the kidnappers.

15:37.230 --> 15:39.369
I'm just saying you need
to be a little more realistic.

15:39.370 --> 15:41.964
Aw, zoe.
Yeah?

15:41.970 --> 15:45.360
Stay... Away... From me.

15:45.370 --> 15:47.258
I threw your stuff
into a bag

15:47.280 --> 15:48.929
and pushed it
down the stairs.

15:50.480 --> 15:54.769
What about our friend
downstairs?

15:54.780 --> 15:58.375
Oh, he's not hungry.

15:58.390 --> 16:01.985
(siren wails outside)

16:01.990 --> 16:03.685
Hey, what's that sound?

16:05.160 --> 16:06.627
The fire department
is evacuating.

16:06.630 --> 16:09.599
Is there a fire?
No, srr.

16:09.600 --> 16:11.818
But our_surveillanc_e cameras
show it's the entire block.

16:12.930 --> 16:16.331
Okay, get ready
to clean up downstairs.

16:21.680 --> 16:25.172
Fire department! Is anyone here?

16:29.780 --> 16:32.510
We're here for a gas leak.

16:32.520 --> 16:33.942
We're advising you that we'll be

16:33.960 --> 16:36.884
Breaching this door
due to public safety.

16:40.830 --> 16:43.196
Wha-what's going on?

16:43.200 --> 16:44.599
Tracking down a gas leak.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.090
Are you alone
in the house?

16:46.100 --> 16:47.328
Yes, I am.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.661
We'll have to ask you
to step outside

16:49.670 --> 16:52.366
While we check for gas.
I'll just be a minute.

16:52.370 --> 16:54.429
We need to come in now.

16:56.110 --> 16:58.374
Tjs:
Let them in.

17:06.650 --> 17:08.481
I thought you said
you were alone.

17:08.490 --> 17:10.879
My son is very protective
of my privacy.

17:10.890 --> 17:15.827
So, it looks like we have
a gas leak, huh?

17:15.830 --> 17:17.627
We're going to have
to check your house.

17:17.630 --> 17:18.858
You are the owner here?

17:18.870 --> 17:20.326
Oh, I'm the owner, yeah.

17:20.340 --> 17:22.638
And you're with
the fire department?

17:22.640 --> 17:24.631
And yet you're not in uniform.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.505
We got called in.

17:26.510 --> 17:29.138
We need you and anyone
else here out of the house
for your own safety.

17:29.140 --> 17:32.246
Well, I can assure you
it's not coming from here.

17:32.250 --> 17:34.571
I'm very particular
about my maintenance.

17:34.580 --> 17:38.710
So you can just mark
this house off your list
and move on.

17:38.720 --> 17:39.846
I'm afraid we can't do that.

17:39.850 --> 17:41.181
We have to check
the whole block.

17:41.190 --> 17:43.249
(footsteps approach)

17:46.060 --> 17:48.949
It's my daughter-in-law.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.851
She'll have to leave as well.

17:51.870 --> 17:54.464
Just until we know it's safe.

17:58.910 --> 18:00.866
Do you know where you are, son?

18:00.880 --> 18:02.609
I think so.
You think so.

18:02.610 --> 18:05.374
Well, if you think you know
where you are,

18:05.380 --> 18:07.871
What you should do,
what both of you should do

18:07.880 --> 18:11.714
Is go back out the door
you came through.

18:11.720 --> 18:13.881
For your own safety.

18:13.890 --> 18:16.017
That's not gonna happen.

18:17.460 --> 18:19.121
(door lock clicks)

18:33.070 --> 18:34.867
(siren blips)

18:39.650 --> 18:41.572
D.C. Metro.

18:41.580 --> 18:43.377
They're here to help
with the evacuation.

18:43.380 --> 18:46.213
See, sometimes we get
a stubborn homeowner,

18:46.220 --> 18:48.415
And you gotta pry him
out of the house.

18:48.420 --> 18:51.150
You are the homeowner here,
right?

18:59.470 --> 19:01.961
We'll step out.

19:01.970 --> 19:06.168
We'll step out
because we don't want
to get in anybody's way.

19:06.170 --> 19:09.207
We don't want to step
on anybody's toes.

19:12.810 --> 19:15.142
Cara, let's go.

19:16.450 --> 19:17.917
Did you get
that mess cleaned up?

19:17.920 --> 19:20.081
No.

19:32.470 --> 19:36.691
You're making a real habit
of finding me looking my worst.

19:36.700 --> 19:38.691
Guess so.

19:42.140 --> 19:45.769
Are you pissed at me
for ruining your escape plan?

19:45.780 --> 19:48.044
Beth ann, what happened
with you and zoe?

19:48.050 --> 19:50.439
I said something
I should say to you.

19:50.450 --> 19:52.213
Stay away from me.

19:52.220 --> 19:54.518
I get it, okay?
If we get out of here,

19:54.520 --> 19:56.215
You're gonna go back
to being you,

19:56.220 --> 19:58.950
And I'm gonna go back to being
the tuition relief girl.

20:03.700 --> 20:07.192
You're the only good thing
in my life.

20:08.240 --> 20:11.266
(slow music plays)

20:15.810 --> 20:17.471
Seriously?

20:17.480 --> 20:20.369
Just pretend like
we're somewhere else.

20:20.380 --> 20:21.699
Nobody can see us.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.073
I can see us.

20:23.080 --> 20:25.241
My mom, she made me get
dance lessons

20:25.250 --> 20:28.549
For dad's inauguration.
I'm good.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.687
Dad's inauguration?

20:30.690 --> 20:32.885
Do you even realize
how obnoxious that sounds?

20:32.890 --> 20:37.395
I just wanted you to know

20:37.400 --> 20:41.769
that, baby, you're the best

20:41.770 --> 20:45.069
I got my red dress
on tonight

20:45.070 --> 20:48.164
dancing in the dark
in the pale moonlight

20:48.180 --> 20:50.569
Evasion route took longer
than I expected,

20:50.580 --> 20:51.877
But we weren't followed.

20:51.880 --> 20:53.541
You weren't.
I would have known.

20:53.550 --> 20:55.279
Hope he's worth all this.

20:55.280 --> 20:56.542
He's a weapon.

20:56.550 --> 20:58.814
I'm gonna use him
against widener.

21:04.590 --> 21:05.750
Finley...

21:05.760 --> 21:07.785
Clear.

21:07.800 --> 21:09.290
Oh!

21:09.300 --> 21:12.189
Clarenbach?

21:28.820 --> 21:30.071
Dennis.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.775
Nice to see you.
It's me, francis.

21:31.790 --> 21:33.485
You'll be staying here with us
for a little while.

21:33.490 --> 21:35.481
Comm:
Boss. I'm deeper into

21:35.490 --> 21:38.254
Today's file for station orange.

21:38.260 --> 21:40.478
Something here
about the soldiers.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.421
What's it say?

21:41.430 --> 21:42.988
Decrypting now.

21:44.100 --> 21:46.125
They've been given
the advanced protocol.

21:46.130 --> 21:48.121
No, wait, not "given..."

21:48.140 --> 21:50.233
Injected with the
advanced protocol

21:50.240 --> 21:52.094
And they are currently
deployed on a mission.

21:52.110 --> 21:53.338
What kind
of mission?

21:53.340 --> 21:54.659
Thayer?

21:55.480 --> 21:56.833
Hostage rescue.

21:57.440 --> 21:59.647
Gah!

22:00.410 --> 22:02.139
Gun!

22:04.990 --> 22:06.719
(gunfire)

22:11.090 --> 22:12.557
Down! Everyone stay down!

22:13.130 --> 22:15.223
Ian, get down!

22:16.330 --> 22:17.456
Beth ann:
Is it a rescue?

22:17.470 --> 22:18.994
I don't know.

22:19.000 --> 22:20.695
(gunfire)

22:20.700 --> 22:22.691
Aah! No!

22:36.020 --> 22:37.442
Koz:
Are you hit?

22:37.450 --> 22:38.712
No!

22:38.720 --> 22:40.039
Find him! Take him out.

22:45.960 --> 22:47.188
No, no!

22:48.060 --> 22:49.391
We need him alive.

22:52.330 --> 22:53.558
Widener set us up.

22:53.570 --> 22:56.038
He wants me dead.

22:56.040 --> 22:59.032
He wanted us to bring hawkins
and thayer back here.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.507
Cut the phone lines.

23:00.510 --> 23:03.104
He calls in our position,
we're dead.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.968
Have we heard
anything on hawkins?

23:07.980 --> 23:10.574
(phone ringing)

23:28.900 --> 23:30.936
Guess I'm not
gonna be famous.

23:30.940 --> 23:33.158
(ringing continues)

23:34.610 --> 23:36.077
Let's go.

23:36.080 --> 23:37.672
Look, I just want you
to know I didn't want

23:37.680 --> 23:38.908
To hurt you when
you took those soldiers.

23:38.910 --> 23:40.275
When you
drugged us?

23:40.280 --> 23:41.679
You being in
a semi-conscious state

23:41.680 --> 23:42.908
Is what convinced them
not to kill you.

23:42.920 --> 23:44.376
In essence,
I saved your life.

23:44.390 --> 23:45.379
How much time
do we have left?

23:45.390 --> 23:47.017
Uh, about
30 minutes.

23:47.020 --> 23:48.442
Time left until what?
Come on,
we're leaving.

23:48.460 --> 23:50.416
No, I can't, I can't.

23:50.430 --> 23:51.749
I don't think you really
have a choice. Let's go!

23:51.760 --> 23:53.387
You don't understand.
I want to.

23:53.390 --> 23:54.926
Given the options,
you're a far better choice,

23:54.930 --> 23:57.524
But there are people upstairs,
savage people...

23:57.530 --> 23:59.418
They left and now
we're leaving.

24:21.790 --> 24:24.657
He's loose
inside the house.

24:24.660 --> 24:25.922
Where's my
surveillance video?

24:25.930 --> 24:26.988
Working on it.

24:26.990 --> 24:28.218
Go, I'm okay.

24:28.230 --> 24:29.697
Go.

24:33.300 --> 24:35.962
If I need to pick that up,
we're all in trouble.

24:37.640 --> 24:38.664
Koz.

24:38.670 --> 24:39.807
I know.

24:39.810 --> 24:41.300
Alive.

24:41.310 --> 24:42.709
I know.

25:03.160 --> 25:04.252
(music shuts off)

25:04.270 --> 25:07.797
(distant gunfire)

25:07.800 --> 25:10.189
(indistinct radio chatter)

25:10.200 --> 25:12.760
Those cops and firemen that
showed up for you back there.

25:12.770 --> 25:13.998
They came... Why?

25:14.010 --> 25:15.602
Because you asked for them?

25:15.610 --> 25:18.773
I guess because they know
I'd show up for them.

25:21.850 --> 25:24.045
(distant gunshots)

25:32.230 --> 25:33.686
There you are.

25:36.360 --> 25:38.555
Get up.

25:39.330 --> 25:41.890
Please.

25:41.900 --> 25:43.868
Please...

25:43.870 --> 25:46.009
Shh...

25:46.010 --> 25:47.705
I understand now.

25:47.710 --> 25:50.873
You don't want your friends
to know about us.

25:51.410 --> 25:53.878
Close your eyes.

25:53.880 --> 25:56.178
P-p-please.
Dont,donT".

25:56.180 --> 25:58.819
No peeking.

26:23.340 --> 26:25.205
Okay.

26:25.210 --> 26:26.677
You can look now.

26:29.280 --> 26:30.508
Stay here.

26:30.520 --> 26:31.771
When it's safe...

26:34.250 --> 26:36.480
...I'll come back for you.

26:41.230 --> 26:43.790
(distant gunfire)

26:43.800 --> 26:45.358
(grunts)

26:47.270 --> 26:49.932
Secret service. Don't shoot.

27:00.750 --> 27:01.739
We have a problem.

27:01.750 --> 27:03.638
What is it?

27:03.650 --> 27:05.072
Site's been compromised.

27:05.090 --> 27:06.546
Federal agents.

27:06.550 --> 27:09.041
I'll have their ids very soon.

27:09.060 --> 27:11.551
And our friend in the basement?

27:11.560 --> 27:12.879
Well, he left with the agents

27:12.890 --> 27:14.824
Before I could get
what I needed.

27:14.830 --> 27:16.889
He was tougher than I thought.

27:16.900 --> 27:18.754
But don't worry, gabe.

27:18.770 --> 27:20.624
I'll get him back.

27:20.640 --> 27:21.925
How did they find you?

27:21.940 --> 27:23.498
Well, they must have

27:23.500 --> 27:25.934
Triangulated the signal
and they hacked in.

27:25.940 --> 27:28.909
But they only got as deep
as today's mission.

27:28.910 --> 27:30.332
I'll scrub it.

27:30.340 --> 27:32.843
How is today's mission?

27:32.850 --> 27:34.408
We only got one soldier in.

27:37.850 --> 27:41.149
That should be more than enough.

27:53.200 --> 27:54.599
How much time
do we have?

27:55.670 --> 27:57.262
25 minutes.

27:58.940 --> 28:01.261
This_ isn't a rescue
mi55ion, is it?

28:01.280 --> 28:03.202
It is a rescue
mi55ion.

28:03.210 --> 28:05.599
It's just not yours.

28:10.280 --> 28:12.043
Dunn:
Those people who
were torturing you...

28:12.050 --> 28:14.382
Don't you
work for them?

28:14.390 --> 28:16.312
Why were they
torturing you?

28:16.320 --> 28:19.551
What happens when your
timer gets to zero?

28:19.560 --> 28:21.357
Somehow, I feel
it involves me.

28:21.360 --> 28:23.351
Finley, turn the car around.

28:23.360 --> 28:25.624
Okay!
I work for them.

28:25.630 --> 28:26.824
The cia?

28:26.830 --> 28:28.195
You work for the cia?

28:28.200 --> 28:29.531
I thought...
I thought I did.

28:29.540 --> 28:31.292
But I found out
I just work for widener.

28:31.310 --> 28:33.062
Widener runs the cia.
Mmm...

28:33.070 --> 28:34.560
But this thing he's doing...

28:34.580 --> 28:37.208
It's not cia sanctioned.
(tires screech)

28:37.210 --> 28:39.644
Finley:
We got a tail.

28:40.510 --> 28:41.374
You see who it is?

28:41.380 --> 28:42.608
No.

28:46.590 --> 28:48.717
Please, you cannot
let them take me.

28:48.720 --> 28:50.153
Why were they torturing you?

28:50.160 --> 28:53.584
What widener does
with those soldiers...

28:53.590 --> 28:55.854
It doesn't work without me.

28:55.860 --> 28:57.498
Finley:
They're still
back there.

28:59.770 --> 29:01.397
How much time?

29:01.400 --> 29:02.890
Less than 20.

29:02.900 --> 29:04.868
Please stop asking
about the time.

29:04.870 --> 29:07.805
It makes me fear
for my well-being.

29:11.610 --> 29:14.807
What we did to those soldiers...

29:16.220 --> 29:18.108
When they're under
the influence of a...

29:18.120 --> 29:20.008
A pharmaceutical,

29:20.020 --> 29:23.353
They have no
moral compass at all.

29:23.360 --> 29:26.011
You can instruct
them to do anything.

29:26.030 --> 29:28.351
Without fear.
Without hesitation.

29:28.360 --> 29:30.851
They're widener's hit
squad here in this country.

29:30.870 --> 29:32.349
Why does widener need you?

29:32.370 --> 29:34.691
Because I'm the only one
that knows the formula.

29:34.700 --> 29:36.429
And I'm the only one
who knows how that works.

29:36.440 --> 29:37.668
Here he comes.

29:41.040 --> 29:43.600
Now, please...

29:43.610 --> 29:47.944
Tell me what happens when
your timer gets to zero.

29:47.950 --> 29:50.373
(distant gunfire)

29:54.720 --> 29:57.518
Thayer:
Come out.

30:09.300 --> 30:11.165
Kyle devore.

30:11.170 --> 30:12.592
Yes?

30:12.610 --> 30:14.237
Beth ann gibson.

30:14.240 --> 30:16.231
Are you here
to rescue us?

30:25.990 --> 30:27.878
(gunshot)

30:42.940 --> 30:45.158
He left us?

30:46.610 --> 30:48.339
He left us.

30:54.680 --> 30:56.375
What are
you domg?

30:56.380 --> 30:57.711
Kyle, don't.

30:57.720 --> 30:59.369
Don't!

31:09.530 --> 31:11.725
(siren blaring)

31:13.030 --> 31:13.962
Finley?

31:13.970 --> 31:16.188
I can't lose him.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.963
What are you gonna do?

31:17.970 --> 31:19.733
Leave him here.

31:19.740 --> 31:21.731
Buckle up.

31:31.350 --> 31:32.886
(tires screech)

31:51.100 --> 31:53.307
(tires screech)

32:21.070 --> 32:22.697
(gunfire)

32:30.140 --> 32:32.472
(clicking)

32:33.880 --> 32:35.279
You're out, thayer.

32:35.280 --> 32:37.441
Toss your weapon.

32:37.450 --> 32:39.111
And come out real slow.

32:43.390 --> 32:44.880
You want to get to a radio,

32:44.890 --> 32:47.051
You need to come through us.

32:50.260 --> 32:52.854
That's the plan.

33:01.810 --> 33:05.075
(grunts)

33:13.350 --> 33:16.581
How could he keep
coming like that?

33:20.130 --> 33:21.324
I don't know.

33:21.330 --> 33:23.958
(radio crackles)

33:23.960 --> 33:26.599
Building's secure.
We got him.

33:29.500 --> 33:33.504
Man (over loudspeaker):
The shooting is over. Everyone
assemble in the main room.

33:36.010 --> 33:38.274
Don't make us come
looking for you.

33:41.210 --> 33:44.441
The shooting is over. Everyone

33:44.450 --> 33:46.270
Assemble in the main room.

33:47.490 --> 33:50.618
Don't make us come
looking for you.

34:16.750 --> 34:18.377
Koz (on radio):
Thayer is down.

34:18.390 --> 34:20.540
What do you mean he's down?

34:23.190 --> 34:26.353
What's the matter, mr. Gibson?

34:26.360 --> 34:28.521
Things not going your way?

34:28.530 --> 34:30.748
Put it down.

34:30.760 --> 34:33.422
Think about your daughter.

34:33.430 --> 34:35.364
Think about tory.

34:35.370 --> 34:37.736
Iam.

34:37.740 --> 34:39.696
You're gonna release tory.

34:39.710 --> 34:42.065
And the rest of these kids.

34:42.080 --> 34:45.572
Or I'll put you down,
you sick son of a bitch.

34:47.880 --> 34:49.939
(tires screech)

34:54.520 --> 34:55.714
Time.
We're good.

34:55.720 --> 34:57.381
Any moment now.
No contact ahead.

34:57.390 --> 35:00.223
But I'll check those vehicles.

35:00.230 --> 35:03.859
You're turning me over to
the kidnappers, aren't you?

35:05.900 --> 35:07.492
(car door shuts)

35:13.140 --> 35:15.802
Amber?

35:15.810 --> 35:16.879
Are you okay?

35:16.880 --> 35:19.769
Yeah.

35:21.450 --> 35:24.647
Where's lqle devore?

35:25.550 --> 35:27.780
Call him.

35:29.220 --> 35:30.653
Kyle!

35:31.460 --> 35:33.325
Where are you?

35:35.600 --> 35:37.795
Kyle!

35:37.800 --> 35:39.552
Hurst:
Now spread your feet
a little wider.

35:39.570 --> 35:41.788
Good.

35:43.600 --> 35:45.090
Both eyes open?

35:45.110 --> 35:46.668
Open and focused on the sight.

35:46.670 --> 35:48.831
Let the weapon do all the work.

35:48.840 --> 35:50.808
Now just aim center mass.

35:50.810 --> 35:53.745
Lightly squeeze
the trigger back.

35:53.750 --> 35:55.342
Hurst!

35:55.350 --> 35:56.476
(gunshot)

35:56.480 --> 35:58.141
(grunts)

36:15.330 --> 36:16.991
You had to do it.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.093
Give me the gun now, lqle.

36:22.040 --> 36:23.200
Give me the gun.

36:23.210 --> 36:25.075
(gun cocks)

36:27.880 --> 36:29.643
Just... Get back!

36:29.650 --> 36:31.914
Please! Please, don't hurt him!

36:32.950 --> 36:34.918
Put the gun down, kid.

36:37.720 --> 36:39.381
Do what he says.

36:42.560 --> 36:45.290
They won't shoot
the president's son.

36:45.300 --> 36:48.167
Let's all just take a breath.

36:48.170 --> 36:49.967
And think this through.

36:53.040 --> 36:54.007
Run.

36:54.010 --> 36:55.898
Let's go!

36:58.480 --> 37:00.698
Go!

37:07.090 --> 37:08.819
What are we gonna do now?

37:08.820 --> 37:11.550
Well, they can't get out.
I'm talking about hurst.

37:11.560 --> 37:13.653
Our fall guy's dead. Thayer
took out half our people.
Calm down.

37:13.660 --> 37:16.595
We should evacuate.
No.

37:16.600 --> 37:18.921
If he compromised
our position...
If he had, we'd be dead now.

37:18.930 --> 37:20.522
This is still
the safest place to be.

37:20.530 --> 37:23.795
So, please just find
my daughter.

37:56.700 --> 37:58.793
We said we'd keep going

37:58.810 --> 38:01.131
Until one of us said stop.

38:01.140 --> 38:04.200
So, are you saying it now?

38:10.720 --> 38:13.587
(man yells)

38:13.590 --> 38:15.285
Oh, my god! Oh, my god!

38:15.290 --> 38:18.214
Help me.

38:31.640 --> 38:34.006
There's no way out!
We can't get out!

38:34.010 --> 38:35.739
Yeah, but-but they can't
get in, either.

38:42.080 --> 38:44.844
I killed hurst.

38:44.850 --> 38:47.011
No, no, no. You had to, okay?

38:47.020 --> 38:49.318
You had to, you had
to save my dad.

38:49.320 --> 38:51.652
Kyle, look at me.

38:51.660 --> 38:54.982
You-you saved my father.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.761
Do you have what I asked for?

39:09.810 --> 39:12.631
Yeah, we have him.

39:12.650 --> 39:14.800
Expect another call.
I will let you know

39:14.820 --> 39:17.971
When and how I will collect him.

39:17.980 --> 39:21.882
Please tell me which hostage
you would like released.

39:23.720 --> 39:25.654
I assume it's the niece

39:25.660 --> 39:28.720
Or the, uh, protectee.

39:28.730 --> 39:30.789
Which one?

39:30.800 --> 39:32.950
Or shall I choose for you?

39:34.330 --> 39:36.525
Are you sure about this?

39:38.570 --> 39:40.629
He's about control.

39:40.640 --> 39:43.029
We need to take some of it back.

39:44.510 --> 39:46.637
Finley, if this is

39:46.650 --> 39:49.642
Our one shot with him,
then we take it.

39:52.050 --> 39:53.483
Yeah, about that.

39:53.490 --> 39:55.185
We're going to renegotiate.

39:55.190 --> 39:57.988
I don't think you understand.

39:57.990 --> 39:59.719
I think we do.

39:59.730 --> 40:01.857
What we have is what you need.
It's what widener needs.

40:01.860 --> 40:04.328
So what we need
is a better offer.

40:05.160 --> 40:07.526
One hostage isn't enough.

40:07.530 --> 40:10.795
We're going to need all of them.

40:25.080 --> 40:26.570
What's gonna happen to me?

40:26.590 --> 40:28.148
(phone ringing)

40:29.890 --> 40:32.085
That didn't take long.

40:34.730 --> 40:36.027
Hello.

40:36.030 --> 40:37.622
Tjs:
Is this agent susan dunn?

40:37.630 --> 40:38.858
Yes, who is this?

40:38.870 --> 40:40.394
We met earlier today.

40:40.400 --> 40:42.095
You might remember.

40:43.600 --> 40:46.194
I've lost something
and perhaps, uh,

40:46.210 --> 40:47.859
You picked it up accidentally.

40:47.870 --> 40:49.963
And if you did, I was hoping

40:49.980 --> 40:51.208
You'd be a sweetheart

40:51.210 --> 40:52.871
And give it back to me.

40:52.880 --> 40:54.370
Why would I do that?

40:54.380 --> 40:57.645
'cause I'm on my way
to see your sister.

40:57.650 --> 40:59.208
And I've got a dumpster
all picked out

40:59.220 --> 41:00.539
For her when I'm through.

41:00.550 --> 41:02.040
So, why don't you just, uh,

41:02.060 --> 41:04.051
Check and make sure
that you didn't walk away

41:04.060 --> 41:07.848
With something
that doesn't belong to you.
