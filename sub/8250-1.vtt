01:49.330 --> 01:50.560
Do you copy?

01:50.610 --> 01:53.470
- Roger CapCom, you got it, too?
- What is it?

01:53.570 --> 01:54.720
I don't know, Captain.

01:54.730 --> 01:57.660
TacSignal has it at 500
miles, inbound real fast.

01:57.710 --> 01:59.150
Whoa!

02:00.270 --> 02:01.740
That's not one of ours.

02:01.750 --> 02:02.890
Confirmed inbound bogy...

02:06.700 --> 02:08.680
Werewolf flight. Camera's now on.

02:09.370 --> 02:11.790
Whoo, man is he moving!

02:11.980 --> 02:13.740
Unidentified aircraft,

02:13.800 --> 02:15.640
you are violating restricted air space.

02:15.690 --> 02:17.540
Reduce speed to Mach 1.

02:17.600 --> 02:21.240
Repeat, slow down, descend to
3,000 feet and identify,

02:21.250 --> 02:22.780
or we will force you down.

02:24.870 --> 02:26.820
Command, this is Werewolf leader.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.640
Bogy not responding and
he's walking away fast.

02:29.880 --> 02:32.320
Suggest Air National Guard at
Franklin attempt intercept.

02:32.380 --> 02:34.020
This is Cowboy flight.

02:34.080 --> 02:35.370
I got a lock-on.

02:35.580 --> 02:37.020
Request permission to fire.

02:37.100 --> 02:38.960
Cowboy, you are cleared to fire.

02:43.160 --> 02:44.500
- Ah!
- Mib!

02:44.530 --> 02:46.600
You should have activated the cloaking device!

02:46.690 --> 02:48.910
I cannot remember everything.

02:49.360 --> 02:50.470
It disappeared!

02:50.530 --> 02:53.240
He’s just disappeared!

03:59.020 --> 04:00.400
Greetings.

04:03.600 --> 04:04.840
Oh, you need a room?

04:04.850 --> 04:06.080
Correct.

04:06.140 --> 04:08.400
Uh... soon as I... fill out an application.

04:08.430 --> 04:09.410
Just a form there.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.529
I also seek out techno-industrial sector

04:17.600 --> 04:20.130
where I can purchase 2 or 3
simlats of platinum paste.

04:20.870 --> 04:23.040
Oh... this time of night, huh?

04:23.300 --> 04:24.940
Oh... gee! Let's see.

04:26.490 --> 04:28.940
See, I'm kind of new to the area. I don't…

04:29.170 --> 04:30.350
Do you know where I could obtain

04:30.410 --> 04:33.260
a heliomizon graphing device
operable at 8 fathoms?

04:33.580 --> 04:36.300
You know... the day guy, he
knows this area really good.

04:36.310 --> 04:38.380
I’m sorry, I can't help ya.

04:40.570 --> 04:42.050
Was this a double occupancy?

04:42.360 --> 04:44.330
Correct. That is my mate.

04:45.020 --> 04:47.750
Yeah. Right. You know, I'm sure she is.

04:50.490 --> 04:51.520
That's

04:51.590 --> 04:53.830
that's fine, yeah, okay.

05:02.760 --> 05:06.180
Will that be, uh... cash... or charge?

05:06.230 --> 05:07.840
Heh?

05:07.900 --> 05:09.640
How are you going to pay for the room?

05:10.940 --> 05:12.380
We shall remunerate

05:12.440 --> 05:13.890
with metallic tender disks.

05:13.940 --> 05:15.290
Correct.

05:15.340 --> 05:17.080
This is fine. Yeah.

05:48.490 --> 05:49.850
This is a primitive device.

05:50.410 --> 05:52.570
We must find one with the necessary components

05:52.580 --> 05:54.390
to communicate our distress to Remulak.

05:54.490 --> 05:58.090
When the High Master hears about
the destruction of our ship,
he will be most displeased.

05:58.150 --> 05:58.840
Affirmative.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.380
He will surely cut off my
plarg and hand it to me.

06:03.090 --> 06:04.540
But, do not despair, Prymaat.

06:04.590 --> 06:05.870
We will be rescued.

06:06.090 --> 06:07.900
Until then, we must adapt.

06:08.270 --> 06:09.870
When the hydrogen droplets have ceased,

06:09.890 --> 06:12.460
we will go forth and live, undetected on Earth

06:12.490 --> 06:13.720
amongst the blunt skulls.

06:14.100 --> 06:15.890
Beldar, how can we live

06:15.920 --> 06:17.340
among the blunt skulls?

06:18.750 --> 06:20.190
We will blend in.

06:40.740 --> 06:42.110
Hey, Otto,

06:42.130 --> 06:43.960
this dude's almost as fast as you are.

06:45.590 --> 06:47.320
Nah, man. This boy's the best.

06:47.350 --> 06:48.630
Shows up on time,

06:48.650 --> 06:50.090
gives me an honest day's work.

06:50.120 --> 06:53.260
- You can't find people like this anymore.
- You know that’s right.

06:53.450 --> 06:57.160
Now, these other dudes, these white
boys, and the brothers, show up late,

06:57.180 --> 06:57.950
they loaf around,

06:57.970 --> 07:00.630
- all they want is a check.
- I heard that.

07:04.070 --> 07:05.470
Here is your Super Juice Master.

07:05.480 --> 07:06.760
For future reference,

07:06.780 --> 07:08.220
frequent cleaning of blades will prevent

07:08.240 --> 07:10.660
motor wear and accumulation of Earth bacteria.

07:19.010 --> 07:20.740
I told ya, the boy is good.

07:20.840 --> 07:22.170
If I could find 3 more like him,

07:22.180 --> 07:23.130
I'd retire.

07:24.460 --> 07:25.420
Excuse me, Otto

07:25.520 --> 07:27.680
I believe it is time for mid-day
cessation of activities

07:27.690 --> 07:28.870
for protein-carbo intake.

07:29.120 --> 07:30.230
Yeah, sure, take your lunch break.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.760
Lunch, lunch, lunch.

07:33.800 --> 07:34.890
Boy loves to eat.

07:36.520 --> 07:38.370
Lunch, lunch, lunch,

07:38.950 --> 07:40.490
lunch, lunch,

07:41.770 --> 07:43.170
lunch, lunch, lunch,

07:43.240 --> 07:45.750
lunch, lunch, lunch.

07:45.790 --> 07:49.030
Lunch! Lunch!

07:50.330 --> 07:51.910
Greetings, Earthwoman.

07:53.390 --> 07:55.380
Time for the mid-day
consumption of mass quantities.

07:55.540 --> 07:57.740
I have re-radiated leftover starch disks.

07:58.220 --> 07:59.930
Ah, pizza. I will enjoy it.

08:01.410 --> 08:02.230
There.

08:02.890 --> 08:03.580
Warning,

08:03.610 --> 08:05.230
do not sear the top of your neck hole

08:05.230 --> 08:07.420
in the molten lactate
extract of hoofed mammals.

08:18.470 --> 08:20.050
Excellent!

08:20.700 --> 08:21.840
The final component

08:21.850 --> 08:23.900
for the intergalactic communicator.

08:23.960 --> 08:24.500
Correct.

08:26.890 --> 08:27.530
There.

08:27.540 --> 08:28.730
Perhaps a final tightening

08:28.740 --> 08:30.380
of the spiral dimension fasteners.

08:30.390 --> 08:32.460
Beldar, activate the device!

08:32.650 --> 08:33.620
Address Marlax!

08:33.630 --> 08:35.350
Inform him of our situation.

08:35.409 --> 08:37.289
There is no advantage to delay.

08:51.550 --> 08:53.130
Verscrab!

09:00.500 --> 09:02.080
Phone home!

09:05.810 --> 09:09.000
Marlax! Marlax!

09:09.010 --> 09:10.490
Marlax! Marlax!

09:11.660 --> 09:12.930
Greetings, Beldar.

09:12.940 --> 09:14.540
We haven't heard from you in klarzogs,

09:14.550 --> 09:16.880
and I'm glad to see your life on
Tinzar still active.

09:17.220 --> 09:18.760
Greetings, Marlax.

09:18.760 --> 09:20.090
I trust you have enslaved the planet

09:20.100 --> 09:21.930
and are awaiting further instructions?

09:23.860 --> 09:25.670
Mmm... unanticipated

09:25.680 --> 09:27.160
failure of mentanglian drive

09:27.170 --> 09:28.410
has caused us to abandon our vessel

09:28.420 --> 09:30.040
in a fluid mass.

09:31.470 --> 09:35.100
At what time coordinates might
we expect a rescue vessel?

09:35.110 --> 09:36.380
Rescue vessel?

09:36.660 --> 09:38.180
You tahpath!

09:38.480 --> 09:41.520
I would not like to be in your cone when
the High Master hears of your failure,

09:41.560 --> 09:43.340
He will not take it lightly.

09:43.630 --> 09:45.130
I will try to arrange for a star cruiser

09:45.140 --> 09:47.240
to enter your solar system in about oh...

09:47.250 --> 09:48.720
7 zerls.

09:49.640 --> 09:51.960
- 7 zerls!
- 7 zerls!

09:52.190 --> 09:54.680
Pluget! Remulak! Narpel!

10:05.620 --> 10:07.410
7...zerls!

10:11.960 --> 10:14.770
Beldar, there is something we should discuss

10:14.780 --> 10:17.580
that is far more important
than planetary conquest.

10:17.650 --> 10:19.940
But what could be more important than

10:20.050 --> 10:21.800
planetary conquest?

10:22.120 --> 10:25.460
Beldar, I am with cone.

10:27.330 --> 10:28.680
You?

10:28.690 --> 10:30.270
I?

10:30.330 --> 10:31.800
A young one?

10:31.860 --> 10:33.270
Affirmative.

10:41.610 --> 10:43.020
$8,000.

10:43.390 --> 10:45.490
That's the best week I've ever had,

10:46.360 --> 10:48.130
and there's $1,200 for you, Beldar.

10:49.720 --> 10:50.960
Thank you.

10:51.210 --> 10:52.110
By the way Beldar,

10:52.120 --> 10:54.540
you still haven't given me
your social security number.

10:59.130 --> 11:01.260
My social security number.

11:01.270 --> 11:04.440
I... I am sorry. I keep forgetting.

11:04.820 --> 11:06.050
Look man, I need that number.

11:06.060 --> 11:08.500
I got state payroll forms, workman’s comp…

11:08.560 --> 11:09.930
You do have a number, don’t you?

11:10.060 --> 11:13.010
Of course. I am a citizen of this planet.

11:13.070 --> 11:14.700
All right my man, give me the number.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.050
O…

11:17.060 --> 11:18.510
2… 5…

11:18.750 --> 11:19.750
6…

11:20.000 --> 11:24.050
X… point… 3…

11:24.930 --> 11:26.820
O… B…

11:27.320 --> 11:30.630
8… 7…

11:30.640 --> 11:34.060
Beldar, my man, you trying to tell me
you don't have a social security number?

11:34.740 --> 11:35.730
Correct.

11:35.790 --> 11:36.770
Why not?

11:36.980 --> 11:39.330
I am an illegal alien.

11:41.790 --> 11:43.160
I knew you were too good to be true.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.760
Every time I make some money this happens!

11:45.180 --> 11:46.200
So where you from?

11:46.380 --> 11:47.710
The planet Remulak.

11:47.720 --> 11:50.500
I am Fuel Survey Underlord for your entire…

11:50.510 --> 11:52.000
Never mind. Never mind.

11:53.580 --> 11:56.550
Look... we gonna work this out.

11:56.860 --> 12:00.290
All right, here’s the deal. Your
name is Donald R. DeCicco, got that?

12:00.350 --> 12:01.700

12:01.710 --> 12:04.730
Yeah, that's you. D-e C-i-c-c-o.

You were born August 11, 1951 in

12:06.930 --> 12:09.350
- Brockton, Massachusetts.
- Brockton, Massachusetts.

12:09.360 --> 12:11.460
Oh, it’s a lovely town there,
and your name is what?

12:11.530 --> 12:14.420
- Donald R. DeCicco.
- That’s right you are! It’s nice to see you!

12:14.520 --> 12:16.500
Your wife's name is Mary Margaret Rowney,

12:16.510 --> 12:19.760
born June 26,1955 in
Narragansett, Rhode Island,

12:19.770 --> 12:20.480
but you're from where?

12:20.650 --> 12:23.150
- Brockton, Massachusetts.
- Hey, my Mother’s from there!

12:23.160 --> 12:24.040
You two were married

12:24.050 --> 12:26.540
June 4, 1975 in Carlos, Greece,

12:26.550 --> 12:27.740
where you met on a fellowship

12:27.750 --> 12:29.160
following your graduation from

12:29.200 --> 12:31.060
- Hobart College.
- Hobart...

12:31.070 --> 12:33.800
- College
- Hobart College, let’s put ‘em together
- Hobart College.

12:33.810 --> 12:34.950
The man's a wizard.

12:34.970 --> 12:36.670
Everything else you need is in here--

12:36.680 --> 12:38.410
birth certificates, family names,

12:38.420 --> 12:40.520
school records, employers, addresses,

12:40.530 --> 12:41.500
Grandmother's maiden name,

12:41.510 --> 12:44.090
not that they'll ask, but it’s in there.

12:46.270 --> 12:48.050
Most important, your social security numbers.

12:48.060 --> 12:48.720
What’s your name?

12:48.730 --> 12:49.900
Donald R. DeCicco.

12:49.910 --> 12:51.410
Donny DeCicco, nice to meet you.

12:51.670 --> 12:53.170
Welcome to the United States.

12:53.530 --> 12:55.240
Right in there. Up and down.

13:05.650 --> 13:07.200
This is a fine craft.

13:07.260 --> 13:09.170
It can be operated with some ease.

13:09.420 --> 13:11.610
Yo, man! Come on, not so close, all right?

13:11.840 --> 13:13.190
I mean, it's not that I'm against close,

13:13.200 --> 13:14.920
it's just not my thing man.

13:14.940 --> 13:17.070
See, in America, we got
this thing called space.

13:18.260 --> 13:19.730
There you go.

13:20.750 --> 13:22.200
Beldar, if you gonna live and have kids,

13:22.210 --> 13:24.280
you gonna have to get yourself together.

13:24.650 --> 13:26.090
Buy yourself a car,

13:26.300 --> 13:27.990
maybe get a hat for that head,

13:28.400 --> 13:30.820
and you got to do somethin’ about those teeth!

13:32.080 --> 13:33.050
Teeth.

13:34.180 --> 13:36.350
Beldar, you know what the key
to success in this country is?

13:36.410 --> 13:38.380
- I do not.
- Well, I’m gonna tell ya.

13:38.740 --> 13:41.370
Look good. Be your own boss.

13:41.610 --> 13:43.290
Never get chained to a desk.

13:43.370 --> 13:45.620
When it comes to business, take cash only.

13:46.130 --> 13:48.130
Look good. Be own boss.

13:48.230 --> 13:50.400
No desk. Cash only.

13:50.540 --> 13:52.090
You got it.

13:52.700 --> 13:54.860
- Got more of that gum man?
- Of course

13:56.650 --> 13:59.790
On second thought, I better not
chew and drive. I might hit somethin'.

14:26.280 --> 14:28.040
I... I'm really better with English.

14:28.050 --> 14:30.640
all I'm getting is clicking noises over here.

14:31.230 --> 14:31.730
Clicking?

14:31.800 --> 14:33.180
Clicking? Clicking? Que?

14:33.910 --> 14:35.960
Could you be a lamb and have a seat?

14:36.840 --> 14:39.580
Tako uno seatado, por favor.

14:42.120 --> 14:43.980
Hey there. I'll take that.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.410
Mr. Seedling can't see anyone today. He's...

14:46.440 --> 14:49.370
havin' one of those days. Thanks.

14:49.850 --> 14:50.870
Isn't that cute?

14:50.940 --> 14:52.580
Okay, that's not yours.

14:55.720 --> 14:58.300
Now, bear in mind these
figures are not to scale.

14:58.650 --> 15:01.970
You see, I'm suggesting we
put these electronic collars

15:02.180 --> 15:03.660
on all the deportees.

15:03.890 --> 15:06.440
Then we bury a wire along the border,

15:06.540 --> 15:08.210
forming an invisible fence.

15:08.270 --> 15:10.520
Now, the next time this illegal

15:10.760 --> 15:12.180
tries to enter the country…

15:16.360 --> 15:17.190
Pow!

15:17.800 --> 15:19.440
A jolt he won't soon forget.

15:19.690 --> 15:20.720
It’ll send a nice message

15:20.730 --> 15:22.090
to the rest of the population.

15:22.690 --> 15:25.060
- Let's get on this.
- Yes. Right away, sir.

15:28.780 --> 15:30.860
Why am I the only one who can see the problem?

15:31.000 --> 15:32.340
I don't know.

15:32.360 --> 15:33.950
Everyone else just ignores the problem

15:33.960 --> 15:36.960
- hoping it'll go away, but it won't.
- You're absolutely right.

15:37.400 --> 15:38.510
Not going to disappear.

15:38.760 --> 15:40.330
- Maybe I should just give up too.
- Oh, no.

15:40.550 --> 15:43.160
Sure, just give up, be like everybody else.

15:43.170 --> 15:43.730
Not you.

15:43.740 --> 15:46.750
- Go the easy route and let the country
be overrun.
- You wouldn't be happy.

15:46.810 --> 15:48.140
Well, that's why I have to give it

15:48.180 --> 15:50.810
everything I have… 100%.

15:51.210 --> 15:52.710
I know everyone thinks it's crazy.

15:52.720 --> 15:53.610
…and obsessive.

15:54.000 --> 15:55.480
…that I'm a mental case.

15:55.650 --> 15:57.290
…wacko, completely insane.

15:59.260 --> 16:00.550
I have something for you,

16:01.710 --> 16:03.640
that deceased SSI number you flagged,

16:03.680 --> 16:05.340
DeCicco. He's back.

16:05.980 --> 16:08.010
It's the 10th job he's taken this month.

16:08.150 --> 16:11.450
Not bad for a guy that was shot to
death, in a clam bar in Sheepshead Bay.

16:12.170 --> 16:15.340
Seems now, "Mr. DeCicco"
is an appliance repairman

16:15.350 --> 16:16.890
in Jersey City.

16:17.160 --> 16:19.690
Let's see. Donald DeCiccos 1 through 5

16:19.760 --> 16:21.580
turned out to be a Samoan,

16:21.690 --> 16:23.800
a Vietnamese, a Sicilian,

16:23.980 --> 16:24.940
a Canadian,

16:25.190 --> 16:26.270
and a Belgian.

16:26.280 --> 16:28.710
...Belgian, yes, and he
skipped back to Belgium.

16:30.420 --> 16:31.820
I lost him, Eli.

16:32.470 --> 16:33.630
This one I want.

16:35.400 --> 16:36.700
Dr. Rudolph?

16:36.910 --> 16:38.310
This is Mr. DeCicco.

16:38.390 --> 16:40.850
He wants his teeth capped... all of them.

16:44.430 --> 16:45.450
Okay.

16:46.570 --> 16:48.120
We'll just take a look.

16:50.680 --> 16:52.940
Hello, Mr... uh...DeSicko.

16:52.950 --> 16:53.660
DeCicco.

16:53.940 --> 16:54.900
The name is DeCicco.

16:54.910 --> 16:56.780
Mr. DeCicco, I'm Dr. Rudolph.

16:57.230 --> 16:59.970
Can we send for your regular dental records?

17:01.690 --> 17:02.710
When I was a young one,

17:02.720 --> 17:05.369
I chipped a toothhorn on my
rocket sled, in a verl storm

17:05.480 --> 17:07.829
but there were no records...

17:07.980 --> 17:09.839
which we could send from...

17:10.569 --> 17:12.450
where... I... we come from.

17:14.210 --> 17:15.369
All right.

17:16.470 --> 17:18.130
Now, I understand...

17:18.230 --> 17:20.849
- you want to have your teeth capped.
- Correct.

17:22.410 --> 17:24.240
Let’s just take a look.

17:27.530 --> 17:29.680
and open, please.

17:36.520 --> 17:38.860
and close, please.

17:45.240 --> 17:47.870
and open, please.

17:53.930 --> 17:55.400
Okay, we'll start the caps

17:55.410 --> 17:58.540
right about... here, Mr. DeFasco.

17:59.100 --> 18:00.190
Cicco!

18:01.490 --> 18:03.450
and open wider...

18:04.310 --> 18:05.910
if you can.

18:18.290 --> 18:19.340
Headrest comfortable?

18:19.640 --> 18:20.850
Fine.

18:22.020 --> 18:23.080
All right.

18:24.490 --> 18:26.850
I'm going to give you some nitrous oxide.

18:27.080 --> 18:30.170
Now, if you feel any pain, just let me know.

18:37.510 --> 18:39.790
and breathe.

18:59.870 --> 19:01.010
Beldar!

19:01.020 --> 19:01.820
Beldar!

19:02.090 --> 19:03.950
Mibs! Mibs!

19:05.140 --> 19:06.660
Human authority figures.

19:07.610 --> 19:09.010
Mibs! Mibs!

19:09.020 --> 19:11.610
We must egress immediately.

19:23.470 --> 19:26.250
They're at the portal! We are scrapnoids!

19:28.930 --> 19:30.170
Open up!

19:37.270 --> 19:38.250
Beldar!

19:38.390 --> 19:40.050
Around back! Come on!

19:42.850 --> 19:44.090
There they go.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.820
Fast! Fast!

20:05.060 --> 20:06.380
Turnbull!

20:07.420 --> 20:09.400
Okay, no foreign passports,

20:09.410 --> 20:12.460
letters, correspondence, newspapers,

20:12.490 --> 20:13.940
nothing to indicate their country of origin,

20:13.950 --> 20:16.220
except for these Mardi Gras suits.

20:16.240 --> 20:17.690
Let me see that.

20:17.930 --> 20:19.490
Maybe they're Brazilian.

20:19.550 --> 20:20.630
Sir?

20:20.950 --> 20:23.290
You know what, it would be better
if that went through me.

20:24.250 --> 20:26.200
He's not in a good mood.

20:26.820 --> 20:28.990
I think I found something, sir.

20:29.260 --> 20:31.800
Ah, that symbol also appears on this card.

20:32.920 --> 20:34.990
Let me see that.

20:35.390 --> 20:36.790
Possibly Korean.

20:36.800 --> 20:37.570
Possibly.

20:37.960 --> 20:39.200
Have this text analyzed.

20:39.210 --> 20:40.730
Okay, run this.

20:41.100 --> 20:43.100
Look at this filth! It's filthy!

20:44.220 --> 20:46.010
Human beings don't live like this.

20:47.160 --> 20:48.920
- Find out where they're from,
- On it.

20:49.290 --> 20:50.920
Because wherever that is,

20:53.820 --> 20:56.040
I'm seeing to it that they go back there.

21:00.980 --> 21:03.600
La Guardia Airport, Delta terminal.

21:04.190 --> 21:05.250
La Guardia.

21:05.780 --> 21:07.680
Do you wish I take BQE, the Van Wyck,

21:07.690 --> 21:09.130
or, my suggestion, Woodhaven Boulevard

21:09.140 --> 21:10.240
to the Grand Central Parkway?

21:10.250 --> 21:12.170
There are more signal
lights, but less traffic.

21:12.640 --> 21:14.280
Whatever, as long as we get there.

21:14.310 --> 21:15.560
Woodhaven, Grand Central.

21:15.570 --> 21:17.950
345. Drop-off, La Guardia.

21:36.550 --> 21:37.890
Good evening.

21:40.410 --> 21:42.500
- Greetings.
- Greetings, my genetomate.

21:43.220 --> 21:44.140
How was your day

21:44.150 --> 21:45.910
ferrying humans across the grid?

21:47.040 --> 21:47.940
Acceptable.

21:47.950 --> 21:49.290
Tips could have been better.

21:54.390 --> 21:56.170
The impending cone prepares

21:56.180 --> 21:57.450
for its emergence.

22:05.950 --> 22:07.120
It's Khoudri.

22:07.940 --> 22:09.740
Welcome, my employer and landlord.

22:09.780 --> 22:11.660
Beldar, forgive my intrusion.

22:11.680 --> 22:12.620
Rhavi is sick.

22:12.630 --> 22:14.700
Can you work the midnight shift, use my car?

22:14.710 --> 22:15.600
Most certainly.

22:15.610 --> 22:17.400
However, this will be the last triple shift.

22:17.560 --> 22:19.300
The birth spasm is near.

22:19.570 --> 22:23.790
- Beldar, once again, you have pulled
me from the fire.
- Yes

22:28.520 --> 22:30.540
Beldar, you have been working

22:30.550 --> 22:31.810
through your slar phase again.

22:31.820 --> 22:33.590
Goz deprivation is not good.

22:33.940 --> 22:36.710
But, this dwelling is no longer acceptable.

22:36.830 --> 22:40.330
Even by Earth standards, it is not
good enough for you and our young one.

22:40.520 --> 22:42.620
We must strive to settle
in a safer neighborhood,

22:42.680 --> 22:43.730
one with better schools

22:43.740 --> 22:46.840
and a stronger local economic
matrix which will not tax us to death.

22:47.770 --> 22:50.320
We are no better off than we were 2 zerls ago.

22:51.180 --> 22:53.470
This 15 year-old ranch-style
dwelling is available

22:53.480 --> 22:57.120
at $6,900 down with an
assumable 9% fixed-rate mortgage.

22:57.510 --> 23:00.200
- But how? Our currency stock is insufficient.
- Incorrect

23:01.100 --> 23:03.280
You have been working
nights. I have been saving.

23:03.360 --> 23:05.550
Ah, I praise you, earthwoman.

23:14.940 --> 23:16.360
My bluevarp has broken.

23:16.990 --> 23:18.630
The birth spasm has begun.

23:23.260 --> 23:24.090
Nothing to this.

23:24.100 --> 23:26.600
Childbirth is a simple, gentle act of nature.

23:26.780 --> 23:29.380
Yeah. You just take care of Prymaat.
We'll get plenty of good pictures.

23:32.600 --> 23:34.560
I hate you, Beldar!

23:34.570 --> 23:36.600
I hate you!

23:49.860 --> 23:53.330
1… 2… 3

23:56.460 --> 23:58.810
Get it off me!

24:01.300 --> 24:04.020
Breathe easy. Okay, one good push.

24:12.620 --> 24:14.450
It's so cute.

24:19.900 --> 24:22.540
Would you like to cut the
umbilical cord, Mr. Conehead?

24:28.030 --> 24:29.300
No, no hair

24:29.790 --> 24:31.520
and bring the top of the head up higher.

24:32.760 --> 24:34.440
No, higher… like a point.

24:36.400 --> 24:39.290
Sir, we have the analysis from Lexcon Labs

24:39.300 --> 24:41.250
on the card found at the subjects' dwelling.

24:41.360 --> 24:43.660
No known language, script, or characters

24:43.670 --> 24:46.520
within the foreign catalog
nationality encodes.

24:46.720 --> 24:48.360
No, no. You're not listening to me.

24:48.520 --> 24:51.630
Look, here, you see where
my hand is? That high.

24:51.920 --> 24:52.810
What else?

24:52.890 --> 24:55.540
Okay, the lab did a study
of the Mardi Gras costumes.

24:55.550 --> 24:59.090
They contain fibers with 5
wholly unknown polymer strands.

24:59.100 --> 25:00.670
Nothing like it anywhere.

25:01.130 --> 25:02.420
So what are they saying?

25:03.660 --> 25:05.420
They're from another planet?

25:05.910 --> 25:07.940
That theory's been advanced, yes sir.

25:08.740 --> 25:11.310
This is big. This is really big.

25:11.880 --> 25:12.740
Uh... permit me sir...

25:12.750 --> 25:15.120
should they in fact be,
creatures from another planet,

25:15.130 --> 25:17.230
isn't that Air Force responsibility?

25:17.720 --> 25:19.320
If they're just visiting, sure.

25:20.220 --> 25:21.800
But the moment they try to work here,

25:22.060 --> 25:23.400
they're mine.

25:29.770 --> 25:30.760
Any sign?

25:31.540 --> 25:32.850
No, sir. Nothing yet.

25:37.030 --> 25:38.230
Wait.

25:39.470 --> 25:40.980
Subject vehicle coming your way.

25:41.560 --> 25:43.210
Copy, I have him in sight.

25:43.260 --> 25:43.960
Go?

25:44.130 --> 25:44.830
No.

25:45.260 --> 25:45.740
Go?

25:45.770 --> 25:46.390
No.

25:47.640 --> 25:48.020
Now?

25:48.060 --> 25:49.710
Go.

25:52.570 --> 25:53.650
Freeze!

26:02.640 --> 26:03.670
This isn't him.

26:04.360 --> 26:05.170
What's going on here?

26:05.210 --> 26:06.040
Sir, look at this.

26:07.180 --> 26:08.170
Where did you get this key chain?

26:08.300 --> 26:11.640
It was a gift. From one of
the finest men I've ever known.

26:11.760 --> 26:12.780
And where is he now?

26:13.400 --> 26:14.870
He moved out a week ago.

26:15.330 --> 26:16.890
I have no word from him.

26:17.150 --> 26:19.510
I only wish I had more drivers like him.

26:19.810 --> 26:20.640
Diligent,

26:20.690 --> 26:21.500
punctual,

26:21.530 --> 26:24.280
his cab invariably sweet-smelling.

26:25.240 --> 26:26.620
Take him in and check him out.

26:26.680 --> 26:27.620
Check him.

26:27.680 --> 26:28.290
Turn around.

26:28.300 --> 26:31.030
Find this insignia, find these illegals.

26:31.190 --> 26:33.230
Hi there. I'll take that.

26:33.270 --> 26:34.330
Thank you.

26:35.660 --> 26:38.420
Sir? Sir, good news from Washington.

26:38.760 --> 26:40.090
Your promotion came through.

26:40.200 --> 26:41.000
They must have loved

26:41.010 --> 26:42.510
your electrified border idea.

26:42.580 --> 26:43.870
We knew they would.

26:44.050 --> 26:46.010
On-Site Field Enforcement Head

26:46.040 --> 26:48.030
for the entire southwest.

26:48.720 --> 26:50.130
Assistant Deputy Commissioner.

26:50.870 --> 26:52.200
That should pay quite a bit more,

26:52.210 --> 26:52.980
shouldn't it, sir?

26:53.100 --> 26:55.680
What, are you kidding? An extra $1,500 a year.

26:56.120 --> 26:57.480
Of course I'll take it.

26:57.880 --> 26:58.560
Question.

26:58.740 --> 27:00.270
About this DeCicco case.

27:00.270 --> 27:02.690
We've already invested so many man-hours.

27:02.880 --> 27:05.700
Who cares? Let the next guy handle it.

27:05.890 --> 27:06.970
I'm out of here.

29:29.660 --> 29:31.880
Ah, the morning consumption
of mass quantities.

29:32.090 --> 29:35.370
Grid-like breakfast slabs, extruded mammal
tailings, seared strips of swine flesh,

29:35.380 --> 29:38.100
and flattened chicken
embryos. I will enjoy it.

29:38.190 --> 29:41.960
What is a 7-letter word for a tomb in
ancient Egypt which is a quadrilateral

29:41.970 --> 29:44.950
masonry mass having smooth steeply
sloping sides meeting at an apex?

29:45.170 --> 29:46.980
A “flindar”.

29:55.410 --> 29:56.700
Good morning, parental units.

29:56.970 --> 29:58.200
Dawn greetings, young one.

29:58.430 --> 29:59.660
What would you like for consumables?

29:59.670 --> 30:02.620
Pop-Tarts, chicken embryos, seasoned
patties of ground animal flesh?

30:03.220 --> 30:04.150
I'm not really hungry.

30:04.160 --> 30:04.970
Just some Tang.

30:04.980 --> 30:07.900
Ah, <i>Tang</i>  the drink the
astronauts took to the moon.

30:08.240 --> 30:10.330
Astronauts to the moon.

30:12.530 --> 30:14.820
The Pro-shop called. Your
new putter has arrived.

30:14.830 --> 30:17.450
Ah, my Hawk Tru-Flex
Powerpoint with graphite shaft.

30:17.520 --> 30:20.980
A secret of golf pros
everywhere. A truly manly putter.

30:22.770 --> 30:24.630
What have you done to your cone!?

30:24.930 --> 30:25.670
Nothing.

30:25.680 --> 30:27.180
No? Turn around.

30:29.310 --> 30:30.670
It's not a real tattoo.

30:30.720 --> 30:32.590
Mibs! Mibs! Unacceptable!

30:32.600 --> 30:34.440
It's just a decal. Everyone's wearing them.

30:34.450 --> 30:37.210
If everyone jumped into the bituminous
cauldron, would you jump in too?

30:37.290 --> 30:39.450
I am not a little cone anymore, Dad!

30:39.480 --> 30:42.280
Maintain low tones with me.
Maintain low tones.

30:42.370 --> 30:44.280
Now, go to the hygienic chamber and remove it.

30:44.290 --> 30:46.780
Also, you are wearing far too
much lip and cheek enhancement.

30:46.840 --> 30:49.900
Mom? My makeup looks okay, doesn’t it?

30:49.910 --> 30:51.770
Do not involve the approval

30:51.780 --> 30:53.290
of your other parental unit.

30:54.100 --> 30:56.550
Now, if you wish to accompany me
to the enclosed retail compound,

30:56.560 --> 30:59.170
you will make the necessary
corrections and remove the decal.

31:01.220 --> 31:02.250
Fine.

31:05.820 --> 31:07.130
Beldar.

31:07.390 --> 31:09.500
She looked like a common flathrag on payday.

31:15.540 --> 31:18.130
I don't know what went wrong
with these roses this year.

31:18.610 --> 31:20.080
Maybe I need a gardener.

31:20.520 --> 31:23.260
But sweetie, I'm not gonna pay
some guy to dig in dirt.

31:24.940 --> 31:27.760
Larry, I told you to take
that thing to a professional,

31:27.820 --> 31:29.670
you'll save money in the long run.

31:30.400 --> 31:32.490
Should have bought an electric one.

31:33.800 --> 31:34.910
Beldar, is that you?

31:36.220 --> 31:36.900
Correct.

31:37.150 --> 31:39.500
Bel... Pry.

31:39.800 --> 31:41.450
- Yeah, buddy, you got a minute?
- Of course.

31:41.690 --> 31:44.020
The damn lawn mower won't
start. You know, you…

31:44.100 --> 31:46.250
you’re so darned good with machinery…
would you mind taking a look?

31:46.260 --> 31:47.270
I do not mind.

31:47.950 --> 31:49.050
Greetings, Lisa.

31:50.070 --> 31:52.100
Excellent crop of decorative growth.

31:52.220 --> 31:53.170
You're being nice.

31:53.220 --> 31:54.130
Yes.

31:54.440 --> 31:57.880
Hmm... standard 3 horsepower
internal-combustion

31:57.890 --> 31:59.210
chlorophyll stalk slicer.

31:59.400 --> 32:00.890
There is fuel in the device?

32:00.900 --> 32:02.890
Oh yeah, yeah, there's plenty
of gas in there, I just...

32:02.940 --> 32:05.260
can't get the damn thing to kick over.

32:05.340 --> 32:06.850
Perhaps you and Larry will join us

32:06.860 --> 32:08.970
for consumption of mass
quantities this weekend.

32:09.130 --> 32:12.100
We will ignite our new flame pit
and char some mammal flesh for you.

32:12.520 --> 32:15.470
That sounds like fun. I'll make some coleslaw.

32:15.480 --> 32:18.500
Ahh, coleslaw. We will enjoy it.

32:39.570 --> 32:40.960
Thanks, Bels.

32:47.460 --> 32:50.400
Connie, how are ya?

32:51.520 --> 32:52.230
Hi!

32:52.240 --> 32:53.690
Oh, my God! I love it!

32:54.650 --> 32:55.820
I'm so glad!

32:59.300 --> 33:01.110
Did you see him?

33:03.820 --> 33:05.180
Oh, there's a sale today.

33:06.060 --> 33:08.560
Oh! Oh, this song!

33:27.500 --> 33:29.290
Sorry, it's not ready.

33:30.320 --> 33:31.560
I do not understand.

33:31.690 --> 33:34.040
I have returned at the
agreed-upon time coordinates.

33:34.560 --> 33:37.680
Well, I'm very sorry, Mr. Conhead.

33:37.690 --> 33:39.750
Conehead. The name is Conehead.

33:41.230 --> 33:44.570
Well, uh, look, Mr. Conehead,

33:44.730 --> 33:45.800
we got a little backed up.

33:45.810 --> 33:48.270
It took a little longer than we expected.

33:48.580 --> 33:49.500
Unacceptable.

33:49.940 --> 33:52.020
Not only have you delayed
my departure from here,

33:52.030 --> 33:54.170
but the entire series of
events which was to follow.

33:54.410 --> 33:56.550
What reason could you have for such deception?

33:57.080 --> 34:00.840
Look, I don’t know who you are
or where you're from, but around…

34:00.850 --> 34:02.410
France. We come from France.

34:02.780 --> 34:03.940
Fine, sir.

34:03.980 --> 34:06.410
The point is, it'll be ready when it's ready.

34:06.710 --> 34:09.320
So, if you, wanna take a seat over there,

34:09.719 --> 34:12.230
I'll call you when your car is finished.

34:13.989 --> 34:16.090
I will comply. What choice do I have?

34:16.460 --> 34:19.469
It is as if you have seized me
at the base of my snarglies.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.489
Hey, Ronnie.

34:24.500 --> 34:25.409
What?

34:25.699 --> 34:27.080
I just have one question.

34:27.130 --> 34:32.239
How could it take so long to do a simple
alignment on an American sedan with
standard rack and pinion steering

34:32.250 --> 34:33.940
and MacPherson struts when
your garage is equipped

34:33.949 --> 34:36.889
with the proper Borg-Warner
digital hydraulic radiometer?

34:38.199 --> 34:40.489
Maybe 'cause I was out back finishing a beer.

34:42.440 --> 34:43.900
Okay

34:54.969 --> 34:56.480
Now, Deputy Commissioner Seedling,

34:56.489 --> 34:57.740
before this committee can recommend

34:57.750 --> 34:59.670
your appointment to the
position of Commissioner,

34:59.730 --> 35:01.840
there's still several questions
regarding your tenure as

35:01.850 --> 35:04.570
Mid-Atlantic District Chief
we’d like answered this afternoon.

35:04.630 --> 35:07.840
Well, Senator, that was a long
time ago, and a very busy office.

35:07.900 --> 35:10.250
I won't be able to recall
everything that came across my desk.

35:10.860 --> 35:12.440
Well, we won't be asking you about everything,

35:12.510 --> 35:15.050
just case number 889343-B,

35:15.080 --> 35:17.950
the so-called... Des...

35:18.010 --> 35:18.730
DeCicco.

35:18.740 --> 35:20.280
DeCicco file.

35:20.910 --> 35:23.160
Yes, I... I do remember that case.

35:23.220 --> 35:26.350
In an unsuccessful pursuit,
labeled by some as excessive,

35:26.460 --> 35:28.310
you authorized the expenditure of...

35:28.940 --> 35:31.360
a quarter of a million dollars to
apprehend what you believed was

35:31.370 --> 35:33.260
an illegal alien from another planet?

35:34.790 --> 35:35.970
A spaceman?

35:36.610 --> 35:37.700
Excuse me.

35:41.400 --> 35:44.330
Actually, Senator, I never said on the record

35:44.340 --> 35:46.180
that I thought they were spacemen,

35:46.640 --> 35:48.990
and the case is still open,

35:49.300 --> 35:52.390
and I… I feel that when we
make this apprehension,

35:52.780 --> 35:54.890
the expense will be well-justified,

35:56.950 --> 35:58.220
is what I feel.

36:00.570 --> 36:02.250
I can't believe my appointment’s being held up

36:02.260 --> 36:04.940
- by the piece of crap DeCicco case!
- Oh, I know.

36:05.370 --> 36:09.180
- I want the whole file put back in the
system, flagged at red levels.
- Yes sir, right away.

36:09.190 --> 36:10.460
Why me? Why me?

36:10.470 --> 36:11.010
I don't know.

36:11.020 --> 36:14.230
- The system always screws the guy that
works hard.
- It's unfair. It's not right.

36:14.640 --> 36:17.390
- The politicians now, they don't even care.
- It's the system.

36:17.900 --> 36:18.770
The phone's ringing.

36:18.780 --> 36:20.060
The phone rings all the time.

36:20.070 --> 36:23.190
- No Eli…
- Oh, the phone. I'll get it.

36:24.600 --> 36:26.220
This guy's out there somewhere,

36:26.910 --> 36:28.360
and he's going to make a mistake,

36:29.020 --> 36:30.250
and when he does,

36:31.660 --> 36:32.690
we'll nail him.

36:41.230 --> 36:43.860
You know, I've never dated
a girl taller than me before.

36:43.930 --> 36:44.930
Oh, really?

36:45.060 --> 36:46.420
I've always been tall.

36:48.770 --> 36:49.700
So,

36:49.790 --> 36:52.080
are both your parents from Europe, or…

36:53.810 --> 36:55.240
When did they come to America?

36:56.110 --> 36:57.890
Uh, before I was born.

36:58.290 --> 37:00.630
Yeah, my Grandfather’s from the old country.

37:00.640 --> 37:01.670
Oh, really?

37:01.730 --> 37:02.440
Which one?

37:04.760 --> 37:06.040
I'm not sure.

37:06.140 --> 37:07.330
One of the big ones.

37:15.800 --> 37:19.420
Wow! My Mom's the only
other woman I’ve ever known

37:19.430 --> 37:22.030
who could take a sandwich like that.

37:23.180 --> 37:24.170
Are you going to eat that?

37:24.600 --> 37:26.120
No, no.

37:28.090 --> 37:29.450
You're something special.

37:30.010 --> 37:31.040
You know that?

37:34.740 --> 37:37.310
So, Beldar's giving this woman

37:37.320 --> 37:38.470
Beginners driving lessons

37:38.480 --> 37:40.040
for the 5th time, huh?

37:40.800 --> 37:42.220
That's interesting.

37:42.530 --> 37:44.460
Interesting? Why is that interesting?

37:44.720 --> 37:47.170
I mean, the same woman.

37:47.780 --> 37:48.810
Think about it.

37:48.920 --> 37:50.230
The same woman.

37:50.890 --> 37:51.960
It's been my experience

37:51.970 --> 37:53.410
the more you think about it,

37:53.420 --> 37:55.240
the more you probably should worry

37:55.480 --> 37:58.650
because... all men are pigs.

37:59.050 --> 38:02.540
Ah, pigs - an omnivorous
domesticated cloven hoofed vertebrate

38:02.550 --> 38:04.780
that defecates in the same place it consumes.

38:05.210 --> 38:06.230
Exactly.

38:07.580 --> 38:09.930
You should be very careful with Beldar.

38:10.290 --> 38:12.260
He's got that continental accent

38:12.270 --> 38:14.760
that some women find irresistible.

38:32.840 --> 38:35.080
I really like it when you watch me drive.

38:40.180 --> 38:41.350
Whoops.

38:45.820 --> 38:47.360
Watch it, lady!

38:47.420 --> 38:49.870
Funny, it's like you've been instructing me

38:49.880 --> 38:52.870
all my life, you know?

38:53.730 --> 38:56.990
Yeah, it's almost as if you've…

38:58.040 --> 38:59.780
controlled me completely.

39:08.710 --> 39:12.130
Beldar, I just don't think I'm ready
for this test yet. I really don't.

39:12.140 --> 39:15.420
I can't-- Oh, listen to me.

39:16.650 --> 39:17.730
I'm okay.

39:18.400 --> 39:21.370
I'm just... human,

39:23.660 --> 39:26.400
and I'm... weak.

39:32.310 --> 39:33.080
Gladys!

39:33.360 --> 39:34.230
Look at me.

39:34.970 --> 39:36.120
Oh, yeah.

39:36.130 --> 39:38.270
I am your teacher. You are my student.

39:38.400 --> 39:41.320
It is natural that you harbor certain
Feelings for your driving instructor.

39:41.480 --> 39:44.160
But, you must understand
nothing can come of this.

39:51.730 --> 39:53.690
58 US dollars, please.

39:56.360 --> 39:57.800
You are one of the finest men

39:57.810 --> 39:59.000
I have ever met.

39:59.420 --> 40:01.230
When my species comes to rule this planet,

40:01.240 --> 40:04.210
your name will be on the protected
roles, and you will come to no harm.

40:05.870 --> 40:07.520
You are wise,

40:08.190 --> 40:10.520
but there's a sadness to your wisdom.

40:31.650 --> 40:32.900
Ronnie, don't.

40:34.030 --> 40:35.300
Please?

40:35.340 --> 40:36.720
Come on, Connie.

40:36.980 --> 40:38.410
I've told you how I feel about you,

40:38.420 --> 40:39.840
doesn't that mean anything?

40:40.730 --> 40:42.070
It means a lot.

40:42.170 --> 40:45.610
Well, it's like, I pick
you up, I take you out,

40:45.930 --> 40:48.340
I bring you home, we say good night,

40:48.950 --> 40:50.210
and you never kiss me.

40:50.530 --> 40:52.490
What is there, somethin'
wrong with me or somethin'?

40:53.580 --> 40:54.600
Of course not.

40:56.370 --> 40:57.430
It's just...

40:59.560 --> 41:00.710
my parental units...

41:05.270 --> 41:07.870
well, we've never been
really affectionate, and...

41:09.150 --> 41:11.240
I'm afraid I don't know how.

41:13.850 --> 41:15.030
It's easy.

41:15.480 --> 41:17.480
All you do is lean forward and kiss,

41:17.490 --> 41:18.760
like this.

41:43.650 --> 41:44.890
Ronnie, don't.

41:45.700 --> 41:47.530
Ronnie, I am not ready.

41:47.750 --> 41:49.310
Oh, you're ready.

41:49.750 --> 41:50.580
Don't.

41:50.910 --> 41:52.070
Ronnie!

42:19.580 --> 42:20.850
Greetings.

42:21.580 --> 42:23.530
How was your date with Ronnie?

42:24.890 --> 42:26.150
Daddy was right.

42:27.690 --> 42:29.740
Earth boys only care about one thing.

42:30.280 --> 42:32.180
You mean Ronnie was behaving like a flandap.

42:33.130 --> 42:33.970
Flandap?

42:34.240 --> 42:36.780
Flandap-- an uninvited grasper of cone,

42:36.940 --> 42:38.310
a masher, a hustler.

42:39.590 --> 42:40.380
Flandap?

42:52.680 --> 42:54.150
Hi, Mr. Conehead.

42:57.240 --> 43:00.160
- I find you unacceptable.
- Yes, sir.

43:00.210 --> 43:02.830
If I did not fear incarceration,
by human authority figures,

43:02.840 --> 43:04.510
I would terminate your life functions

43:04.520 --> 43:06.660
by applying sufficient
pressure to your blunt skull

43:06.670 --> 43:08.350
so as to cause its collapse!

43:10.330 --> 43:12.240
Th-Thank you.

43:16.140 --> 43:17.830
Do not worry about the flandap Ronnie.

43:17.920 --> 43:20.250
You will not see him within
the Laurel Hills quadrant again.

43:21.410 --> 43:22.860
I cannot believe you did that.

43:23.910 --> 43:25.070
You've ruined my life.

43:25.660 --> 43:27.650
Young one, when we return to Remulak…

43:27.660 --> 43:29.730
I don't care about Remulak.

43:30.440 --> 43:34.010
That stupid star cruiser
is never coming anyway!

43:36.530 --> 43:39.250
But she said… I-I thought…

43:39.480 --> 43:40.990
I will attend to the young one.

43:45.780 --> 43:46.590
Come in.

43:56.620 --> 44:00.330
You know Connie, I read in a magazine
you can talk to me about anything.

44:02.300 --> 44:03.280
Mom…

44:05.620 --> 44:07.310
what does it feel like to…

44:09.490 --> 44:10.670
hone?

44:11.580 --> 44:14.910
Well, for me, the first
time, it happened so fast,

44:14.920 --> 44:16.650
I hardly knew I had honed at all.

44:17.010 --> 44:20.160
and after that, it was more
repetition than anything else.

44:20.720 --> 44:21.880
Oh, my young one,

44:22.250 --> 44:24.740
your cone is changing, and you feel unsure.

44:26.310 --> 44:28.370
How would you know what it's like?

44:29.690 --> 44:31.820
You've been married to Daddy for so long.

44:32.250 --> 44:34.030
I was a young cone myself once.

44:34.890 --> 44:36.220
Before I met Beldar, I was

44:36.230 --> 44:38.460
very attracted to a young Thorasian forger.

44:38.820 --> 44:42.650
and as far as I was concerned,
there was no other life force
in the universe that mattered.

44:43.350 --> 44:45.740
But then he got a job
working at a volcano complex

44:45.750 --> 44:47.800
on some moon in the Bituminous Cluster

44:48.140 --> 44:49.390
I never saw him again.

44:49.820 --> 44:51.720
and it broke my blood valve chamber.

44:52.680 --> 44:53.540
I got over it,

44:54.170 --> 44:55.610
and it worked out for the best.

44:55.970 --> 44:57.300
Because, then I met your Father.

44:57.770 --> 45:00.850
And I knew then that I had
found my true life mate.

45:03.440 --> 45:04.590
I love you, Mom.

45:05.880 --> 45:07.540
The currents of chromobonding

45:07.550 --> 45:09.430
between you and your parental units

45:09.520 --> 45:10.850
are infinite.

45:24.370 --> 45:25.360
Mib!

45:33.380 --> 45:34.170
Good shot.

45:34.890 --> 45:36.460
So, have you given any thought

45:36.470 --> 45:38.810
to what I said about, you know...

45:39.320 --> 45:39.860
hair?

45:40.450 --> 45:41.720
I do not understand.

45:42.010 --> 45:45.650
Bel, it’s me, Larry. You don't have
to pretend it doesn't bother ya.

45:45.900 --> 45:47.020
You're a young man, my friend.

45:47.420 --> 45:49.100
No reason for you to be skinny up top.

45:50.130 --> 45:51.450
I'll let you in on a little secret.

45:52.380 --> 45:53.370
Not all my own hair.

45:54.450 --> 45:55.360
Hard to tell, isn't it?

45:55.650 --> 45:57.210
Only from very high altitude.

46:00.290 --> 46:01.530
Well, I'll say no more.

46:01.780 --> 46:02.460
Think it over.

46:02.630 --> 46:04.140
Meanwhile, I'll be happy
to introduce you to my man.

46:04.200 --> 46:06.060
- Thank you.
- Hey, Mr. Conehead,

46:06.140 --> 46:08.360
way to blast out of the bunker, huh?

46:09.120 --> 46:10.080
It's me, Ronnie!

46:10.090 --> 46:13.150
I hope you didn't cut your hand
when you tore open my car.

46:14.600 --> 46:15.680
I'm fine.

46:16.400 --> 46:19.350
Yes, thank you. No problem. Good-bye.

46:20.920 --> 46:21.690
Okay

46:21.700 --> 46:23.210
Hey, chubby, come on.

46:32.410 --> 46:33.910
All right, Conehead,

46:34.450 --> 46:36.320
that puts me 4 behind you at the turn.

46:36.680 --> 46:37.390
Correct.

46:39.240 --> 46:42.040
Hey, Mr. Conehead, I'm miserable.

46:42.980 --> 46:44.720
I feel so bad for what I did.

46:45.670 --> 46:47.880
It feels like somebody's ripping my guts out.

46:48.460 --> 46:49.880
She won't take my calls.

46:51.080 --> 46:53.180
Hey, kid, I'm not paying you to yak.

46:54.340 --> 46:55.020
Buddy?

46:56.940 --> 46:58.120
What's with the head?

47:01.440 --> 47:03.770
Forget him, he's not a member.

47:11.240 --> 47:13.640
That concludes the 1-meter competition.

47:14.090 --> 47:16.370
Next will be the 3-meter board category

47:16.960 --> 47:20.220
The first diver for the
home team, Connie Conehead.

47:20.230 --> 47:22.410
You’ll execute a 1-1/2 flip with a twist,

47:22.470 --> 47:24.130
and the head and body enter the water

47:24.140 --> 47:26.400
- with as little splash as possible.
- All right.

47:49.690 --> 47:52.450
Good job. Keep it up.
You've got one more dive.

47:52.730 --> 47:55.490
Diving for Union High, Gail Jensen.

47:55.530 --> 47:56.620
You were great.

47:58.260 --> 47:59.970
I'm sorry about the other night.

48:00.170 --> 48:03.700
I was a real jerk! Okay?

48:04.730 --> 48:07.580
Connie's our best hope for
state championship finals.

48:08.010 --> 48:09.820
Correct. We believe this also.

48:11.000 --> 48:12.200
You know, tell me if I'm wrong,

48:12.210 --> 48:15.360
but I don’t think I ever seen you 2
at any of the parent meetings.

48:15.890 --> 48:17.500
What committees are you on?

48:19.490 --> 48:22.120
You know, we still need volunteers
for the homecoming gala.

48:22.530 --> 48:23.580
- Home…
- coming?

48:23.780 --> 48:24.710
- Coming...
- home?

48:27.630 --> 48:29.220
Let's go Fight!

48:29.490 --> 48:30.960
Let's go Fight!

48:31.000 --> 48:32.380
Hey! Hey! Hey!

48:49.740 --> 48:53.470
Hi, look, I'm sorry if I…

48:53.480 --> 48:56.120
No, I mean, I shouldn't have been so…

48:56.130 --> 48:57.250
Hey, it was me.

48:57.260 --> 48:58.220
Sometimes, I just…

48:58.310 --> 49:00.210
Me, too. Me, too.

49:01.130 --> 49:02.760
If I thought I did anything to…

49:02.790 --> 49:04.290
Oh, no. You didn't.

49:04.300 --> 49:06.620
I mean… I mean it.

49:06.930 --> 49:07.980
Seriously?

49:08.360 --> 49:09.130
Yeah.

49:10.900 --> 49:13.260
Wow. Glad we talked.

49:13.340 --> 49:15.920
And now, parents and students alike,

49:15.930 --> 49:17.450
if you will direct your attention

49:17.460 --> 49:19.450
to the sky above the playing field,

49:19.460 --> 49:22.290
You will be treated to a
display of amateur fireworks

49:22.330 --> 49:24.500
courtesy of Beldar Conehead,

49:24.700 --> 49:28.230
Father of Paramus High's own Connie Conehead.

49:31.590 --> 49:33.340
Careful there, Conehead.

49:49.740 --> 49:51.240
Pretty cheap, Conehead.

50:32.740 --> 50:33.850
Cigar?

50:43.420 --> 50:45.100
Is the light keeping you awake?

50:46.070 --> 50:47.370
No.

50:58.880 --> 51:00.340
Your breathing has become erratic.

51:00.680 --> 51:01.900
A torg for your thoughts?

51:03.530 --> 51:06.600
Beldar, are you content with me?

51:07.430 --> 51:09.410
Of course. Why would I not be?

51:10.180 --> 51:12.540
Now, I would like to enter my slar phase.

51:14.100 --> 51:15.050
Let us suppose

51:15.980 --> 51:17.720
for some reason my life function ceased.

51:17.730 --> 51:18.860
What would you do?

51:19.690 --> 51:21.080
I would incinerate your carcass

51:21.090 --> 51:24.320
in the tradition of Obedai the Obtuse,
and put it in a clean dry place.

51:25.970 --> 51:27.610
Would you find a new genetomate

51:27.620 --> 51:29.570
to bring to our goz chamber and...

51:30.090 --> 51:30.970
propagate?

51:32.570 --> 51:36.250
Ah, my most precious one, I would collapse.

51:36.540 --> 51:38.780
I would draw the shades
and I would live in the dark.

51:39.100 --> 51:41.900
I would never get out of my
slarpad or clean my self.

51:42.240 --> 51:44.520
My fluids would coagulate,
my cone would shrivel

51:44.530 --> 51:47.210
and I would die, miserable and lonely.

51:47.530 --> 51:49.360
The stench would be great.

51:51.300 --> 51:53.650
Oh, Beldar, you have made me very happy.

51:54.310 --> 51:56.410
Yes. I know. Good night.

52:03.930 --> 52:05.660
Life on Earth is good.

52:06.140 --> 52:07.210
I agree.

52:07.280 --> 52:09.550
Stability and contentment have been achieved.

52:17.740 --> 52:19.520
Lay by and put about!

52:19.930 --> 52:21.880
Lay by and put about!

52:22.090 --> 52:24.740
Attention! Return to your port of embarkation.

52:24.860 --> 52:27.720
There is no work for you in the United States.

52:28.050 --> 52:29.810
You have no job skills.

52:29.820 --> 52:32.230
You will be a drag on our economy.

52:32.830 --> 52:34.620
We appreciate your situation,

52:34.630 --> 52:36.890
but we have problems of our own.

52:37.310 --> 52:38.140
Thank you.

52:38.150 --> 52:39.190
Phone, sir.

52:43.040 --> 52:43.860
Seedling here.

52:43.980 --> 52:46.350
Sir, a fax came through on the secure channel.

52:46.980 --> 52:48.330
I think we found him.

52:49.640 --> 52:51.270
Don't toy with me, Eli.

52:51.580 --> 52:53.230
This time, it had better be real.

52:57.530 --> 52:59.820
Oh! Oh, hello, Mrs. Conehead.

53:00.610 --> 53:02.160
I've been meaning to talk to you

53:02.170 --> 53:04.630
about the Christmas tree lighting ceremony.

53:05.480 --> 53:08.000
We found someone else to
head up that committee

53:08.010 --> 53:10.870
and won't be needing Mr. Conehead's services

53:10.890 --> 53:11.750
after all.

53:11.760 --> 53:13.980
So, if you could just thank him for me.

53:14.520 --> 53:16.240
He will be very disappointed.

53:49.720 --> 53:52.400
I'm telling you, Bels, if
you just stay on your game.

53:52.510 --> 53:54.060
you could win that trophy this year.

53:55.010 --> 53:56.790
A meaningless piece of metal and wood.

53:56.960 --> 53:58.340
I compete only with myself.

53:58.570 --> 54:01.950
I appreciate the game for its physics, its
high level of skill, its self-control,

54:01.960 --> 54:03.350
and, of course, spirituality.

54:05.120 --> 54:06.470
You're full of it, Conehead.

54:07.620 --> 54:08.180
The only reason

54:08.190 --> 54:09.620
you're coming to the costume ball

54:09.670 --> 54:12.560
is ‘cause you think you gotta
shot at winning that trophy.

54:12.840 --> 54:13.530
Negative.

54:13.580 --> 54:15.730
Of course if I should win the
trophy, I would accept it,

54:15.740 --> 54:17.240
with limited enthusiasm.

54:26.480 --> 54:27.370
Ron. Harv.

54:27.380 --> 54:28.860
Beldar, what's happenin'?

54:29.320 --> 54:31.320
Hey, Conehead, what kinda
costume are you wearing

54:31.330 --> 54:32.220
to the Halloween dance?

54:32.230 --> 54:34.540
I am not about to tell you, Harv.

54:50.450 --> 54:51.430
Eh?

55:02.920 --> 55:05.280
"Consume alco-beverage. Come get me!"

55:07.970 --> 55:09.630
Ah! Mai tai!

55:09.660 --> 55:10.760
I will enjoy it.

55:30.280 --> 55:31.790
Greetings, earthman.

55:32.570 --> 55:34.850
Huh. Ah, hmm. Ah, huh--

55:35.720 --> 55:37.320
It is good to hone in places

55:37.330 --> 55:39.960
other than our goz chamber before slar phase.

55:41.830 --> 55:43.210
Who said?

55:43.870 --> 55:45.150
Good Housekeeping

56:13.560 --> 56:14.700
What are they doing in there?

56:14.730 --> 56:16.250
Sounds like they stepped on a cat.

56:18.120 --> 56:18.860
Convec 3.

56:18.870 --> 56:19.970
Awaiting Commissioner Seedling.

56:20.020 --> 56:20.690
Go ahead.

56:21.470 --> 56:23.800
Yes sir. We're on him, sir.

56:23.810 --> 56:25.020
Don't make a move without me.

56:25.030 --> 56:27.660
Roger, I understand. No. We won't
make a move until you get here.

56:33.500 --> 56:34.350
Greetings.

56:35.800 --> 56:36.630
Hello there.

56:37.160 --> 56:38.950
We just stopped by to introduce ourselves.

56:38.960 --> 56:40.280
We're Jehovah's Witnesses.

56:40.290 --> 56:42.310
How do you do. I am Beldar.

56:42.780 --> 56:44.160
We attend the Kingdom Hall

56:44.220 --> 56:45.400
on Coveneck Road.

56:45.410 --> 56:48.190
Ah yes, next to the dry
cleaners across from 7-11.

56:48.260 --> 56:51.840
- Exactly. May we ask you a question?
- Proceed.

56:51.980 --> 56:54.780
Do you agree that the world is
headed towards a terrible calamity?

56:55.340 --> 56:56.590
Most definitely.

56:56.920 --> 56:59.560
In fact, I have direct personal
knowledge that this is so.

57:00.170 --> 57:01.840
Great, may we come in?

57:02.040 --> 57:02.700
Of course.

57:02.850 --> 57:04.360
Enter. Assume comfort.

57:05.500 --> 57:06.700
My mate Prymaat.

57:06.990 --> 57:08.580
Greetings. Be seated.

57:12.060 --> 57:15.640
So, what do you know of
the doom awaiting this planet?

57:16.230 --> 57:20.460
Well, as… as Witnesses, we believe that
the end of the world is approaching

57:20.560 --> 57:24.440
and that only 144,000 people
will be saved to rein.

57:24.530 --> 57:26.470
I do not believe it will be that many.

57:27.180 --> 57:28.540
Oh, no, the Bible clearly states

57:28.550 --> 57:31.290
144,000 will be saved to rein.

57:31.370 --> 57:32.970
That is a very optimistic estimate

57:33.030 --> 57:34.250
considering the primitive weapons

57:34.260 --> 57:36.190
the Earth people will use for their defense.

57:36.540 --> 57:38.570
Some Earth weapons are not so useless.

57:38.670 --> 57:39.610
Mibs, drop it.

57:40.340 --> 57:42.890
Well, uh, when the time comes,

57:43.230 --> 57:45.400
no weapon of this earth shall avail mankind.

57:45.920 --> 57:46.570
- Correct.
- Correct.

57:47.820 --> 57:49.000
Where are you people from?

57:49.110 --> 57:51.000
France. We come from France.

57:51.440 --> 57:54.690
But we are American citizens now.

57:54.840 --> 57:55.710
Do you have proof?

57:56.540 --> 57:57.310
Proof?

57:57.320 --> 57:58.120
Well…

57:58.960 --> 58:01.290
I'm going over to Christina's. She’s
gonna give me a ride to the dance.

58:01.300 --> 58:03.830
- So, um… I'll see you there.
- All right.

58:06.140 --> 58:07.850
I take it your daughter was born here.

58:07.960 --> 58:09.950
Yes. She is native to your pla--

58:10.360 --> 58:11.690
uh, country.

58:45.700 --> 58:47.780
Scarle ma tibea meldow.

58:48.930 --> 58:51.460
Scarle ma tibea meldow.

58:54.250 --> 58:56.870
Beldar, phone for you.

58:57.180 --> 59:00.490
Ah, tell the caller that I will return
his call at my next earliest convenience.

59:00.570 --> 59:03.450
No, Beldar. The big phone.

59:03.550 --> 59:05.160
The big ph--

59:07.200 --> 59:09.350
I hope that you humans
have enjoyed your visit!

59:09.410 --> 59:10.920
Come again now! You are leaving!

59:10.930 --> 59:13.080
We haven't finished! How did
you arrive in this country?

59:13.090 --> 59:14.880
- I think you are finished.
- Thank you for coming.

59:17.590 --> 59:18.800
I don’t think they bought it, sir.

59:18.810 --> 59:20.650
Well, you just can't talk
religion with some people.

59:25.050 --> 59:26.130
Woo!

59:49.200 --> 59:50.360
Connie!

59:51.570 --> 59:53.360
Ronnie’s gonna give me a ride home tonight!

59:53.370 --> 59:55.360
so I won't need a ride, okay?

59:55.690 --> 59:57.710
Negative, young lady. We must speak now.

59:57.720 --> 59:58.930
It is imperative.

01:00:03.730 --> 01:00:05.230
I have good news, my young one.

01:00:05.650 --> 01:00:07.030
After zerls of waiting,

01:00:07.220 --> 01:00:09.910
our rescue vessel from
Remulak is coming tonight.

01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:11.420
What?

01:00:11.430 --> 01:00:12.520
You are finally going to see

01:00:12.530 --> 01:00:14.370
the unparalleled joys of your home planet.

01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:16.570
I gotta tell Ronnie.

01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:18.720
Irrational! You will tell no one.

01:00:21.610 --> 01:00:23.220
What if I said I don't wanna go?

01:00:24.090 --> 01:00:27.330
Oh, my infinitely valuable incarnation,

01:00:27.910 --> 01:00:29.880
watching you grow up on this savage planet

01:00:29.890 --> 01:00:31.070
has caused me great pain.

01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:33.400
Your young optic receptacles

01:00:33.410 --> 01:00:35.450
never having observed
the sacred peaks of Arksnap,

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:38.680
the crater of Kuldraf,
the Margseoid Labyrinth.

01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:41.760
I know. I know.

01:00:41.770 --> 01:00:43.480
and I'm sure it's all great,

01:00:44.540 --> 01:00:46.410
and I know that you don't believe me...

01:00:48.890 --> 01:00:50.360
but I'm in love with Ronnie.

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:04.400
Daddy, if you really care,

01:01:05.060 --> 01:01:06.500
you'll let me say good-bye to him.

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:08.240
Although my blood valve chamber

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:09.590
weighs heavily with your feelings,

01:01:10.140 --> 01:01:12.590
tonight, we must remain together.

01:01:13.740 --> 01:01:15.670
You're moving away tonight?

01:01:17.240 --> 01:01:19.080
I guess when you get the call to be the driver

01:01:19.090 --> 01:01:20.740
for the President of France,

01:01:20.740 --> 01:01:21.830
you gotta go.

01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:26.140
I have to tell you something really important.

01:01:26.150 --> 01:01:26.860
What is it?

01:01:27.020 --> 01:01:29.560
Not here. We need to be alone.

01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:31.590
All right!

01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:33.650
The awarding of

01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:36.570
the Fairfield Country Club
Golfer-of-the-Year trophy...

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:38.080
Not so fast, Carl.

01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:40.890
for most-improved handicap through the season.

01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:45.160
And the winner is... Beldar Conehead.

01:02:04.030 --> 01:02:05.720
The daughter and boyfriend are on the move.

01:02:20.680 --> 01:02:21.610
Ronnie.

01:02:23.380 --> 01:02:25.180
Before we do anything at all,

01:02:25.610 --> 01:02:27.020
there's something I have to say.

01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:32.880
I'm different from other girls.

01:02:34.170 --> 01:02:36.820
I know. That's why I love you.

01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:39.610
Oh, Ronnie.

01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:56.540
I cannot believe she left after you told her
not to. Something has corrupted her judgement.

01:02:56.550 --> 01:02:59.790
When we get back to Remulak, I am
grounding her for an entire zerl,

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:01.330
and I mean it!

01:03:18.570 --> 01:03:21.860
Senso rings! Where did you get those?

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:24.300
Under your bed.

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:27.240
Unacceptable! Your cone is too young!

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:29.820
Get up! You're coming to Remulak right now!

01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.770
I am staying with Ronnie.

01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:32.870
Maintain low tones.

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:35.720
Impossible, undesirable, inadvisable.

01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:38.360
Then I'm coming with you. I love you.

01:03:39.830 --> 01:03:41.730
Mibs, human authority figures.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:43.390
We must egress immediately.

01:03:46.530 --> 01:03:49.580
It's over, Conehead! This is the INS!

01:03:49.640 --> 01:03:51.150
Come out with your hands up!

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:52.840
You're under arrest!

01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:07.570
They're going for it!

01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:25.480
Cover him!

01:04:25.490 --> 01:04:26.840
Hold it right there!

01:04:27.820 --> 01:04:28.700
It's the boyfriend.

01:04:28.750 --> 01:04:30.360
Sir, it’s the boyfriend.

01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:39.750
Oh, Beldar!

01:04:41.410 --> 01:04:43.080
Daddy!

01:04:51.550 --> 01:04:55.550
Nice maneuver, but it's all over, Conehead.

01:04:55.620 --> 01:04:57.030
Beldar.

01:04:57.090 --> 01:04:58.900
I think that is the Jehovah's Witness.

01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:01.870
Let's cover him.

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.170
All right, hold on, everybody.

01:05:46.640 --> 01:05:49.310
I love you, Ronnie!

01:05:49.370 --> 01:05:50.820
I love you, Connie!

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:53.380
Back in the car, asshole.

01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:01.430
Gorman, let go!

01:06:04.490 --> 01:06:06.630
Gorman, Gorman, I'm scared!

01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:09.890
You're not getting away this time, Conehead!

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:11.470
You're completely surrounded!

01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:14.120
Put the car down!

01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:34.160
This is the ship's Captain.

01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:36.170
Secure yourselves into the formflat.

01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:37.970
Will initiate mentaglian surge

01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:41.450
as soon we go past the
only moon on this planet.

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:52.610
No problem.

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:54.940
We have successfully passed their moon

01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:58.120
and are preparing now for mentaglian surge.

01:07:40.010 --> 01:07:42.320
Remulak.

01:08:21.130 --> 01:08:23.270
Conglariat prof, High Master,

01:08:23.770 --> 01:08:25.660
I know every cone is allowed

01:08:25.670 --> 01:08:28.580
but 4 uses of the patumias pleasure spool,

01:08:28.590 --> 01:08:30.550
and I partook 6.

01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:33.580
I realize the error of these actions,

01:08:33.640 --> 01:08:35.640
and I vow they will never be repeated.

01:08:35.649 --> 01:08:37.609
I throw myself at your murtax.

01:08:39.510 --> 01:08:40.439
Spathee!

01:08:41.439 --> 01:08:43.100
I realize the pleasure spools

01:08:43.109 --> 01:08:44.859
are a difficult temptation to resist.

01:08:45.130 --> 01:08:48.979
Therefore, you will... narfle the Garthok!

01:08:51.689 --> 01:08:54.340
My God!

01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:58.880
You will, Survey Underlord Beldar Clorhorn

01:08:58.930 --> 01:09:02.840
and Marlax Zanthstrom from
Frotroid Fuel Administration.

01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:07.600
Kimglub amclab Marlax zim Beldar.

01:09:08.330 --> 01:09:11.899
Ah, Beldar, survivor of the wilderness planet.

01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:14.710
What offerings do you bring me
from the conquered worldlet?

01:09:15.319 --> 01:09:16.310
Greetings, revered one.

01:09:16.319 --> 01:09:17.930
Allow me first to present the gift

01:09:17.939 --> 01:09:20.609
of 2 living native beings from the planet.

01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:33.430
You can do what you want to me,

01:09:33.439 --> 01:09:35.580
but I will not apologize for doing my job.

01:09:35.819 --> 01:09:38.979
The United States of America can
no longer solve the employment problems

01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:40.300
of the rest of the universe.

01:09:40.310 --> 01:09:41.720
Silence the slave!

01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:49.290
Delightful.

01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:52.149
They will make a fitting sacrifice to Kratnor.

01:09:52.250 --> 01:09:53.689
What else did you bring me?

01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:57.020
A multitude of gifts from
the blunt skulled civilization.

01:10:00.970 --> 01:10:04.250
A tire iron with 4-way lug wrench.

01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:09.000
An owner's manual

01:10:09.020 --> 01:10:11.120
for a Ford Lincoln Mercury Sable.

01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:13.170
Ford Lincoln Mercury Sable?

01:10:13.180 --> 01:10:18.880
A personal conveyance named for its inventor,
an assassinated ruler, a character of Greco-
Roman myth, and a small fur-covered mammal

01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:22.200
And a dashboard icon.

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:34.080
This is all?

01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:36.100
Certainly not.

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:42.680
Some... chewing gum.

01:10:48.150 --> 01:10:49.760
I am smarfed.

01:10:50.330 --> 01:10:51.550
More than smarfed!

01:10:51.690 --> 01:10:53.140
Flarged by this!

01:10:58.020 --> 01:10:59.530
Beldar, come close.

01:11:03.970 --> 01:11:04.830
Close!

01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:10.930
What have you done to your face portal?

01:11:11.050 --> 01:11:11.660
Huh?

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:13.650
Your traals!

01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:16.260
Excellency, there is good reason!

01:11:16.330 --> 01:11:18.040
Beldar lived among the blunt heads so long,

01:11:18.050 --> 01:11:19.880
he had to adapt to survive.

01:11:19.890 --> 01:11:21.520
He altered his traals.

01:11:21.530 --> 01:11:23.260
It's known as dental bonding.

01:11:23.770 --> 01:11:26.500
I do not care what it is known
as, for the blunt skulls!

01:11:26.510 --> 01:11:28.850
Here it is known as treason.

01:11:29.970 --> 01:11:31.050
Treason?

01:11:31.650 --> 01:11:33.010
Since it is the festival,

01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:34.760
it is at my discretion

01:11:34.770 --> 01:11:36.560
to settle things in the ancient ways.

01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:39.940
Therefore, Beldar, you will...

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:41.800
narfle the Garthok!

01:11:44.730 --> 01:11:46.360
I am no traitor!

01:11:46.750 --> 01:11:48.050
What's a Garthok?

01:11:55.740 --> 01:11:57.640
Every zerl since the ancient times,

01:11:57.650 --> 01:11:59.320
when the 3 moons aligned,

01:11:59.330 --> 01:12:01.030
the melded light of the crescents

01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:03.570
causes a Garthok to emerge.

01:12:04.830 --> 01:12:06.520
So, what's a Garthok?

01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:08.710
Our seats used to be, way up in back.

01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:10.950
These are much better seats.

01:12:40.330 --> 01:12:42.240
<i>That</i>  is a Garthok?

01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:45.110
You can really see it from this vantage.

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:46.820
These are very good seats, Marlax.

01:12:49.250 --> 01:12:50.460
It is time.

01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:57.440
I am Laktar, disgraced guardsman.

01:12:57.450 --> 01:12:59.340
I am prepared to fight for my honor.

01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:08.770
These are great seats.

01:13:09.640 --> 01:13:12.120
I have learned much from
watching the Garthok battle.

01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:13.420
It has weaknesses.

01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:16.170
When my turn comes, I believe I can take him.

01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:20.540
Uh-huh and let me know when Elvis gets here.

01:13:21.330 --> 01:13:22.460
You're next.

01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:33.680
This is a first for me.

01:13:33.960 --> 01:13:34.730
You're next.

01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:36.000
No. He's next.

01:13:36.010 --> 01:13:37.300
No. He said you are next.

01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:39.290
No, but look, he is next, he is next

01:13:39.300 --> 01:13:41.670
You were ahead of me in the
High Master’s court, I do remember.

01:13:41.680 --> 01:13:44.550
- That was then, this is now!
- Nothing like a kalgard!

01:13:51.820 --> 01:13:53.090
You're next.

01:13:55.990 --> 01:13:57.870
Daddy.

01:14:44.940 --> 01:14:47.410
You call that narfling, Beldar?

01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:53.160
Sometimes I feel I want to

01:14:53.170 --> 01:14:54.100
Uh! Uh!

01:14:54.110 --> 01:14:56.580
Run away, I want to

01:14:56.590 --> 01:14:57.420
Uh! Uh!

01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:59.080
Get away

01:14:59.090 --> 01:15:00.940
- from the pain...
- It's a song.

01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:03.340
Big hit on Earth.

01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:04.540
Uh! Uh!

01:15:04.550 --> 01:15:07.270
Part of me Uh! Uh!

01:15:12.850 --> 01:15:13.800
Mib!

01:16:13.590 --> 01:16:15.170
The day is yours, Beldar.

01:16:15.930 --> 01:16:18.010
You have successfully narfled the Garthok.

01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:20.140
Therefore, a request may be granted.

01:16:20.150 --> 01:16:21.870
And I have such a request.

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:22.810
Speak freely.

01:16:22.850 --> 01:16:25.210
That I be permitted to return to Earth,

01:16:26.010 --> 01:16:28.310
and upon my return,

01:16:28.430 --> 01:16:30.360
I will conquer the planet Earth

01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:32.010
and enslave the blunt skulls

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:34.620
in the name of my cone heritage!

01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:40.050
Very well. Request granted.

01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:42.840
I also wish to take the Earth slaves with me.

01:16:43.020 --> 01:16:46.060
Nar, you may only take one slave.

01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:49.270
Then, I take Seedling,
the one with higher office.

01:16:49.340 --> 01:16:50.710
- Thank you!
- So be it!

01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:54.380
Ingrat.

01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:57.530
Let it be written--

01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:58.700
are you writing this?

01:16:59.150 --> 01:17:02.170
That Beldar shall return
to the humo-carb planet,

01:17:02.730 --> 01:17:05.050
where he shall conquer the blunt skulls!

01:17:16.090 --> 01:17:17.600
This is my festival,

01:17:17.610 --> 01:17:19.190
yet I speak, and they do not hear.

01:17:19.390 --> 01:17:20.310
No one listens.

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:21.040
They do not realize

01:17:21.050 --> 01:17:23.880
the degree of difficulty
imposed upon me by my office.

01:17:23.900 --> 01:17:25.450
Power is not easy.

01:17:25.590 --> 01:17:29.040
I sit in judgment and rule.
That is all there is for me.

01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:31.210
- You have no interior life.
- High Master…

01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:33.370
Hi there. Why don’t you
let me take care of that.

01:17:33.380 --> 01:17:35.070
He's having a really tough day.

01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:36.270
Thank you.

01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:49.110
Onglat, Prevnev, Remdrempt, Kraftnor--

01:17:49.260 --> 01:17:51.590
attention all Battle Unit Commanders.

01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:54.060
Entering outer atmospheres of target planet.

01:17:55.290 --> 01:17:57.160
Hold your global ranging positions.

01:17:57.210 --> 01:17:58.820
Arrange mizatym cannon.

01:17:58.910 --> 01:18:01.360
Stand ready for my attack order.

01:18:02.590 --> 01:18:05.460
The star fleet has entered
the Earth's atmosphere.

01:18:05.990 --> 01:18:07.440
They've entered the Earth's atmosphere.

01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:11.020
The moment of glory is upon us.

01:18:11.460 --> 01:18:12.780
Really big day for you, sir.

01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:36.640
Landing enabled, arm cannon,

01:18:36.650 --> 01:18:37.860
verify global target.

01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:40.280
Hold your weapons release until my order.

01:18:48.970 --> 01:18:51.280
Warning! Warning! Danger to battle fleet!

01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:54.070
Presence of enemy laser gun
emplacements in satellites detected!

01:18:54.090 --> 01:18:56.260
- Proceed to secondary target
- Eh?

01:18:56.330 --> 01:18:58.430
Lorbslap! Warning! Warning!

01:18:58.440 --> 01:18:59.670
Danger to battle fleet.

01:18:59.680 --> 01:19:01.040
Danger to battle fleet.

01:19:01.050 --> 01:19:04.150
Lorbslap! Lorbslap! Lorbslap!

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:10.580
Quickly, my family, run, run!

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:26.010
Your happiness and positive perception of me

01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:27.770
is vital to my existence.

01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:30.200
Besides, it's not every day

01:19:30.210 --> 01:19:32.420
that a Father can give the world to his child.

01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:34.180
I love you, Daddy.

01:19:38.220 --> 01:19:39.360
Whoa!

01:19:42.650 --> 01:19:44.380
Beldar's life functions have ceased.

01:19:44.740 --> 01:19:47.000
The Earth weapons have silenced him.

01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:49.150
He died bravely in battle.

01:19:49.480 --> 01:19:51.210
There is no death more glorious.

01:19:51.610 --> 01:19:52.790
He will be missed.

01:19:53.100 --> 01:19:54.500
He will walk with the chosen.

01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:56.050
Super guy.

01:19:57.930 --> 01:19:59.790
I make this proposal to you, Earth creature!

01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:02.010
Your life in exchange for a green card.

01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:03.690
Agreed.

01:20:03.790 --> 01:20:05.850
Provided you can
demonstrate a special job skill

01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:07.400
that no US citizen possesses.

01:20:07.480 --> 01:20:09.180
That should present no challenge to me.

01:20:09.730 --> 01:20:10.830
I have no objection.

01:20:11.090 --> 01:20:12.300
Good! Move!

01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:27.100
Good evening, Mr. Conehead, Mrs. Conehead.

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:29.290
Good evening, Ronnie. Welcome. Enter.

01:20:32.130 --> 01:20:33.630
You look handsome, yet uncomfortable,

01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:35.510
in your pubescent ceremonial garb.

01:20:36.570 --> 01:20:39.830
Yeah. You mean my tux, right?

01:20:39.850 --> 01:20:40.460
Correct.

01:20:40.730 --> 01:20:43.080
Connie is completing
her beautification ritual.

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:44.120
I will summon her.

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:46.600
Ronnie,

01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:48.580
may I have 55 words with you?

01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:53.150
The frightening statistics of young earthlings

01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:55.420
mangling themselves in
internal-combustion vehicles

01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:56.560
on the night of prom ritual

01:20:56.570 --> 01:20:59.220
makes me insist that we use
maximum safety awareness.

01:20:59.280 --> 01:21:01.120
Return at the predesignated time coordinates

01:21:01.130 --> 01:21:04.600
and in fact, take my car.

01:21:04.890 --> 01:21:06.370
Its reinforced alloy superstructure

01:21:06.380 --> 01:21:09.190
is far superior to that
of your rusted-out shit box.

01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:12.600
Gee, thanks, Mr. Conehead.

01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:17.850
Hi, Ronnie. Hi, Daddy.

01:21:29.280 --> 01:21:30.480
This is for you.

01:21:31.030 --> 01:21:32.020
Thanks.

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:44.780
Present yourselves for image emulsification.

01:21:49.880 --> 01:21:52.340
Say "lactate extract of hoofed mammals."

01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:53.960
- Cheese.
- Cheese.

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:56.930
Excellent!

01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:03.530
Good night, Mr. And Mrs. Conehead.

01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:04.510
Good night.

01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:05.500
Good night.

01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:07.560
Night!

01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:16.650
Ah, memories.

01:22:16.970 --> 01:22:18.740
We will enjoy them.
