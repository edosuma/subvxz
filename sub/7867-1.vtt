The Simpsons 20x01
Sex, Pies and Idiot Scrapes

00:28.003 --> 00:31.722
Whoo-hoo. St. Patrick's Day.
I love how they made the river green.

00:34.333 --> 00:36.514
Actually my nuclear plant did that.

00:36.542 --> 00:39.843
And now, that you know,
your life is in danger.

00:43.618 --> 00:46.814
Greetings fellow Irishman,
and lady Irishman.

00:47.035 --> 00:52.145
I, Joseph Fitzgerald, O'Malley
Fitzpatrick O'Donald The Edge Quimby.

00:52.156 --> 00:56.539
Welcome you to Springfield's first
booze-free St. Patrick's Day.

00:59.687 --> 01:00.514
Come on people.

01:00.605 --> 01:03.437
Your drunken Shenanigans
destroy the town every year.

01:03.732 --> 01:06.880
And Ireland is so much more
than the imbibing of spirits -

01:07.219 --> 01:10.327
The Irish gave the world
the paddywagon, the shamrock shake,

01:10.829 --> 01:14.079
And folk dancing, where
you don't move your arms.

01:17.004 --> 01:18.809
Where is the IRA,
when you need them?

01:19.133 --> 01:21.407
We renounced the ways
of the gun and the bomb.

01:24.621 --> 01:27.076
In the old days we
would've been all over that.

01:46.390 --> 01:49.954
Oh no. The Northern Irish
are also having a parade.

01:50.061 --> 01:51.330
Two kinds of Irish people?

01:51.659 --> 01:53.858
What are they fighting over?
Who gets to sleep in the bathtub?

01:54.076 --> 01:57.647
Actually those prots and caths these
have hated each others for centuries.

01:58.776 --> 02:03.270
It always comes down to transubstantiation
versus consubstantiation.

02:08.519 --> 02:10.025
Stop it! Both of you!

02:10.380 --> 02:15.166
You have a common land, a literature,
and the sweetest songs on earth.

02:15.473 --> 02:21.356
<i>* Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ra,  too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral *</i>

02:21.588 --> 02:27.677
<i>* hush my little baby, hush now, don't you cry! *</i>

02:52.201 --> 02:54.720
Oh no! Without the booze
these guys all remember

02:54.841 --> 02:56.180
how much they hate each other.

03:03.630 --> 03:08.264
This was such a pleasent St. Patrick's Day
till the Irish people showed up.

03:11.736 --> 03:13.487
They took my cupcakes.

03:13.722 --> 03:15.797
All right you unwanted miracles.

03:15.898 --> 03:19.737
Give back the ladies cupcakes,
you don't have the teeth for it.

03:19.876 --> 03:21.678
Oy, but we could gum the frosting.

03:21.690 --> 03:23.270
Well if it's good gummin' you're after,

03:23.333 --> 03:25.517
why don't you rather
have this lovely cabbage?

03:28.466 --> 03:29.159
Here you go, ma'am.

03:31.344 --> 03:33.419
Thank you so much, mister...

03:33.709 --> 03:35.252
Patrick Fairley, at your service.

03:35.463 --> 03:38.107
Marge Simpson. Well, Mr. Fairley,

03:38.108 --> 03:40.751
the least I could do is
offer you a cupcake.

03:45.493 --> 03:48.636
Light, moist, and such a marvelous shape retention.

03:48.715 --> 03:50.794
Marge, I own a small bakery.

03:51.007 --> 03:52.182
Will you bake for me?

03:52.373 --> 03:55.284
Me? A professional baker's employee?

03:55.319 --> 03:58.589
Imagine how different my life would be!

04:00.970 --> 04:02.314
Here we are at school, kids.

04:02.614 --> 04:04.545
Hey what are those boxes in the back?

04:04.580 --> 04:06.245
- Cakes.
- See you.

04:06.846 --> 04:10.067
- I'll do it.
- Bless your heart you won't regret it.

04:10.159 --> 04:14.000
I already don't. Homer!
I've got great news.

04:14.015 --> 04:17.093
I'll use my one phone call
to find out all about it.

04:21.334 --> 04:23.941
Mulk requests change of venue.

04:24.032 --> 04:29.511
Green monster cannot get fair trial
in downtown Springfield.

04:29.546 --> 04:30.163
Granted.

04:32.185 --> 04:34.376
Homer Simpson. You're a repeat offender.

04:34.553 --> 04:35.553
Threepeat.

04:35.654 --> 04:38.691
Bail is set at 25.000 dollars.

04:39.226 --> 04:40.900
I make that in a year.

04:41.253 --> 04:43.182
I suggest you see a bail bondsman.

04:46.587 --> 04:49.473
Ok, Simpson. All your information checks out.

04:49.532 --> 04:51.775
I called your boss to verify your employment

04:51.810 --> 04:54.209
and he says you're fired for getting arrested.

04:55.209 --> 04:57.290
You'd be amazed, how offen that happens.

04:58.538 --> 04:59.558
We'll put up your bail money

04:59.814 --> 05:03.563
just pay us 10% and show up
for your court date.

05:03.724 --> 05:05.696
And if I don't show up?

05:05.631 --> 05:07.504
Then you gotta deal with me.

05:07.539 --> 05:10.436
The name's Wolf and I'm a bounty hunter.

05:10.437 --> 05:13.827
If someone skips bail, I track
'em down, and bring 'em back.

05:14.030 --> 05:18.008
I also take a tooth, make a plastic cast,
put it on this necklace

05:18.043 --> 05:20.192
then replace the tooth at my expense.

05:20.340 --> 05:25.857
Well, time to go back to my world of
sleezy bars, tattoo parlors and greasy spoons.

05:25.892 --> 05:29.522
What a great job!
And I could use a job right now.

05:29.523 --> 05:32.504
Whoa. Not just anyone can be a bounty hunter!

05:32.505 --> 05:35.636
You have to pass an online exam.
No wait, I got rid of that.

05:35.671 --> 05:38.760
There is a 10 dollars filing fee,
but you can get around it.

05:38.761 --> 05:41.050
Congratulations, you're now a bounty hunter.

05:43.345 --> 05:45.628
Ok, I've set my trap.

05:45.629 --> 05:48.954
Now to scatter my cheese cubes,
and the rats will come.

05:48.955 --> 05:53.503
Condos! Affordable condos!
Bailjumpers welcome!

05:53.538 --> 05:55.501
Bailjumpers welcome?

05:55.502 --> 06:01.025
That's refreshing after the cold shoulder
we got at the townhomes at sterling point.

06:02.292 --> 06:05.901
Let's not get too excited till we find out
if it's in a good school district.

06:06.302 --> 06:08.505
So wait, are we telling people now?

06:08.506 --> 06:11.079
Stop! In the name of a private citizen

06:11.280 --> 06:13.653
with no connection to the law!

06:17.651 --> 06:20.720
Now, are you gonna come quietly,
or do I have to...

06:21.210 --> 06:22.980
Now let's take about this:

06:22.981 --> 06:26.207
If you shoot me I won't
be able to stop you

06:26.208 --> 06:28.233
and you'll be free to go.

06:28.421 --> 06:31.605
But someone may come after you.

06:31.606 --> 06:35.269
Probably not, given your reputation
for shooting people who come after you.

06:35.386 --> 06:39.212
What I'm trying to say is
not shooting me now

06:39.213 --> 06:43.104
would be the biggest mistake of your life.

06:53.621 --> 06:56.027
- Bulletproof glass.
- Flanders?

06:56.128 --> 06:58.658
Yep, I'm just replacing
the front window at my store,

06:58.793 --> 07:00.165
which was broken in the riot.

07:01.049 --> 07:03.381
Young man, what would your mother say,

07:03.382 --> 07:06.140
if she knew you are shooting
nice people in the brain?

07:06.141 --> 07:10.580
She'd say that year off from Princeton
was the worst decision, I've ever made.

07:10.802 --> 07:13.578
Well, son if you take
responsibility for you actions,

07:13.613 --> 07:16.566
this could be the start
of a better life for you.

07:16.567 --> 07:17.567
Maybe you're right.

07:17.568 --> 07:19.523
Maybe I should...

07:22.393 --> 07:24.789
This case is in the bag.

07:24.965 --> 07:29.527
- Homer you could've killed him.
- I sure could've, thanks to you.

07:31.845 --> 07:33.424
Now I can clearly see potential customers

07:33.634 --> 07:35.070
walk right past my store.

07:35.162 --> 07:36.782
Enjoy you shopping elsewhere!

07:36.817 --> 07:39.008
Hey Ned, I've brought you something.

07:42.950 --> 07:43.835
What the...?

07:44.037 --> 07:46.333
It's you share of the money
for bringing in that bailjumper.

07:47.608 --> 07:49.392
And I never thought I'd say this, but

07:49.596 --> 07:51.002
we make a great team.

07:51.037 --> 07:52.326
Us? A team?

07:52.293 --> 07:54.823
As the salad said to the soup:
I'm all mixed up.

07:54.858 --> 07:56.934
We should be bounty hunters together.

07:56.935 --> 08:00.069
You're kind and smart,
I'm cruel and strong.

08:00.264 --> 08:01.871
Together, we're nothing.

08:02.002 --> 08:05.331
But together we're the perfect bounty hunter.

08:05.456 --> 08:07.043
Well I could use money.

08:07.078 --> 08:09.193
You have to promise me something, Homer.

08:09.228 --> 08:10.276
Sure. What is it?

08:10.338 --> 08:12.938
We have to do everything by the book.

08:13.175 --> 08:17.027
And you have to promise
no didleys or doodleys.

08:17.109 --> 08:19.232
My friend, you have a deal-aroney.

08:19.376 --> 08:19.791
D'oh!

08:32.746 --> 08:33.600
Oh, Marge!

08:33.610 --> 08:36.354
Your talent with cakes is
a rare and precious thing.

08:36.389 --> 08:39.528
Well, thanks. But I've been wondering.

08:40.010 --> 08:44.010
Why do you only have me make
spheres, rods and half-moon shapes

08:44.245 --> 08:46.371
Well, Marge, I'll tell you...

08:47.781 --> 08:49.888
...right after I talked to these customers.

08:50.983 --> 08:54.681
We're going to a bachelorette party
for a really naughty girl.

08:55.041 --> 08:58.446
Yeah. We need something tasty and tasteless.

08:58.742 --> 09:01.203
I've got just the thing.
Courtesy of my newest baker.

09:01.204 --> 09:02.204
Freshly frosted ass-cake.

09:05.137 --> 09:08.321
Oh my god! This is an erotic bakery.

09:14.684 --> 09:15.408
Delicious.

09:15.709 --> 09:18.778
Now, what do you have
in the way of a suggestive cannoli?

09:19.279 --> 09:21.648
We have quite a selection.

09:23.526 --> 09:25.691
- Oh boy.
- I'll leave you with the book.

09:28.186 --> 09:30.901
How could you not tell me?
This is an erotic bakery?

09:31.157 --> 09:32.781
Marge, calm down!

09:32.782 --> 09:35.691
For as long as there's been baking,
there's been erotic baking.

09:35.892 --> 09:37.718
It fills a need, and harms no one.

09:37.753 --> 09:40.682
Harms no one? Explain that to...

09:41.742 --> 09:45.043
Well what about...
I think you forgot about...

09:46.645 --> 09:48.836
My Nr.1 customers are married couples.

09:49.054 --> 09:50.054
Your friends and neighbors.

09:50.055 --> 09:52.537
I just made a custom order for the Hibberts.

09:52.538 --> 09:54.900
It's an exact replica of the good doctors...

09:54.901 --> 09:57.102
- I don't wanna know!
- It's not what you think it is.

09:57.303 --> 09:58.100
Good.

09:58.679 --> 09:59.644
It's his penis.

09:59.843 --> 10:02.139
That's exactly what I was thinking.

10:02.174 --> 10:04.710
Marge, this is a valuable public service.

10:04.865 --> 10:07.095
Without your baking, people like me would be

10:07.130 --> 10:10.504
forced into backalleys repurposing ding dongs.

10:10.698 --> 10:13.664
You have a great gift.
Don't let it go to waste!

10:14.898 --> 10:15.969
Well, okay.

10:20.953 --> 10:24.764
This taser is awesome.
Finally a practical use for electricity.

10:24.800 --> 10:26.265
Dear Lord, thank you for creating

10:26.397 --> 10:28.405
so many evil criminals for us to bring in.

10:28.506 --> 10:30.986
And also thank you for my partner, Homer, who....

10:31.521 --> 10:33.326
Did you just taser my coffee?

10:33.327 --> 10:34.327
Just warming it up.

10:34.328 --> 10:36.521
Now I'll melt the cheese in this croissant.

10:37.256 --> 10:39.695
And get rid of a little extra earwax.

10:40.930 --> 10:43.513
And smoke a relaxing cigar.

10:45.590 --> 10:47.363
Homer, could we take it easy on the taser?

10:47.364 --> 10:48.639
No problem.

10:51.815 --> 10:54.271
- Our first bailjumper.
- Let's roll.

10:55.932 --> 10:58.087
Homer, take the taser out of your pants!

10:58.222 --> 10:59.428
No, it looks cool.

11:15.957 --> 11:17.895
- Who's there?
- Bible salesman.

11:48.427 --> 11:49.072
Daddy's home!

11:49.107 --> 11:51.572
I brought you kids some stuff from work!

11:51.607 --> 11:54.588
There you go, son. Shell casings!

11:54.589 --> 11:57.720
Wow! There's still bullets in some of these.

11:57.763 --> 12:00.807
Point them away from your sisters,
when you hammer them.

12:00.917 --> 12:01.796
Yes, sir!

12:01.940 --> 12:03.013
What'd you get for me?

12:03.170 --> 12:06.465
Something for the sweetest
little scientist in the world.

12:06.500 --> 12:08.399
A new chemistry set!

12:08.434 --> 12:12.816
- Dad, is this from a meth lab?
- The biggest one in town!

12:12.851 --> 12:17.424
- This is evidence.
- Evidence, that I love my little girl.

12:18.285 --> 12:22.584
Marge, I brought you some flowers.
A full dozen this time, no tricks.

12:22.685 --> 12:25.841
Oh, Homie. I got you something too.

12:28.005 --> 12:32.495
A sterling silver picture frame
with pictures of our kids in it.

12:32.695 --> 12:33.983
Yes, for now.

12:34.668 --> 12:37.575
I guess things are working out
pretty good at your bakery job.

12:37.676 --> 12:40.577
Maybe with could order one of your
cakes for Lisa's birthday.

12:40.712 --> 12:42.110
How dare you!

12:42.185 --> 12:43.315
What'd you do that for?

12:43.716 --> 12:45.523
Sorry, sorry! Muscle spasm.

12:46.498 --> 12:49.230
I'm not convinced.
Still on the fence.

12:49.765 --> 12:51.527
Now, I believe you.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.989
He'll be here sooner or later.

13:02.074 --> 13:03.917
So how about a little stakeout music?

13:03.952 --> 13:06.709
Homer, I don't think we have the same musical tastes.

13:06.710 --> 13:11.102
- Well, I like ACDC.
- I like the christian cover band ADBC.

13:11.237 --> 13:24.144
<i>* Kindly deeds done for free. *</i>

13:34.238 --> 13:38.008
- I've never seen anyone eat pizza like that.
- You gotta try it.

13:38.142 --> 13:41.527
This way the pepperoni stay intact
till they reach you stomach.

13:41.528 --> 13:42.528
And, bam!

13:44.632 --> 13:46.685
Man, that's harder to swallow than evolution.

13:46.686 --> 13:50.872
You've gotta roll it from the point.
Here, let me show you.

13:54.418 --> 13:57.718
- Not bad.
- Let it unfurl in your stomach.

13:58.653 --> 13:59.416
There he is!

14:07.660 --> 14:08.938
Oh, kitten whiskers!

14:09.310 --> 14:14.176
There's one thing he didn't count on.
My reckless indifference to human life.

14:18.413 --> 14:21.271
Lord in your mercy, could you
give my friend a stroke?

14:26.447 --> 14:29.150
Seimour, those string beans
were cooked to perfection.

14:29.385 --> 14:32.715
After twenty years, I'm finally
starting to like you.

14:32.750 --> 14:35.085
Just wait for desert Sir,
I made it with you on mind.

14:35.186 --> 14:39.936
Outstanding. I'll just shut my eyes,
and let you place it before me.

14:42.097 --> 14:45.590
Seimour, what's going on?
I'm coming down there!

14:45.771 --> 14:47.465
Quick, we'll have to eat from each end.

14:47.466 --> 14:50.059
We'll know we're safe, when
our lips meet in the middle.

14:55.805 --> 14:59.930
Homer, you can't drive a car onto a subway,
you need a special sticker just to bring a bike.

14:59.931 --> 15:02.626
- Have you no respect for the law?
- Hey it worked, didn't it?

15:02.661 --> 15:06.274
Ok, smart guy, you're going in the bag.

15:08.105 --> 15:09.712
Wait, I left a sandwich in there.

15:12.348 --> 15:15.339
Homer, no! You promised, everything
was supposed to be by the book.

15:15.440 --> 15:19.442
You know what your problem is?
You haven't become as bad as the people we chase.

15:19.477 --> 15:22.357
- This partnership is over!
- I'll tell you, what's over!

15:22.392 --> 15:24.214
This partnership!

15:25.426 --> 15:28.158
You know, if you take your foot
off the accelerator going downhill

15:28.254 --> 15:29.790
you wouldn't use so much gas.

15:30.271 --> 15:33.223
I can't take another word out of you.

15:38.145 --> 15:40.517
I can't believe Flanders dumped me.

15:41.531 --> 15:44.244
Marge do we have any more
of your extra long twinkies?

15:44.407 --> 15:49.330
Oh no! Those were for Mr. Smithers'
commitment ceremony.

15:49.440 --> 15:50.941
Marge, what's going on?

15:52.118 --> 15:54.285
Homie, I've got a confession to make.

15:54.719 --> 15:56.249
I'm an erotic baker.

15:57.481 --> 16:00.154
I hid it all in the one place, you'd never look.

16:02.255 --> 16:05.726
Marge I could see you withholding sex
or withholding cake.

16:05.761 --> 16:08.150
But withholding sexy cake?

16:08.485 --> 16:11.825
I know, we have to move past this,
but I don't see how.

16:13.322 --> 16:15.612
Homie, what do you say, we go to bad?

16:16.076 --> 16:18.828
You, me, and the cake.

16:19.276 --> 16:22.915
First, why don't you and I and
the cake, take a shower?

16:33.022 --> 16:35.478
I'm out of the bounty hunting business.

16:35.679 --> 16:37.153
Not so fast, Ned.

16:37.210 --> 16:39.977
I've got one more bailjumper
for you to pick up.

16:40.105 --> 16:44.386
Forget it! I'm turning in my...
Well, I don't have anything to turn in, so...

16:44.387 --> 16:46.962
That's that.
I suggest you call Homer Simpson.

16:47.097 --> 16:49.772
This is one jumper, that Homer can't catch.

16:53.503 --> 16:53.911
Homer?

16:54.290 --> 16:57.826
Seems he never showed up in court
in the St. Patrick' Day arrest.

16:57.861 --> 16:59.063
Not interested.

16:59.091 --> 17:03.944
All right, if you don't want the job,
I'll just give it to one of these guys.

17:10.042 --> 17:12.300
I'm sure they're all
competent professionals, but...

17:12.336 --> 17:13.958
...you best leave it to me.

17:19.922 --> 17:22.425
Hello, hello, anybody home?

17:25.239 --> 17:26.740
You jumped bail, Homer.

17:26.775 --> 17:28.029
I've gotta bring you in.

17:28.073 --> 17:29.243
What have you done to my family?

17:29.324 --> 17:32.881
I figured a good time to pick you up was
when they are at Lisa's recital.

17:32.982 --> 17:34.901
And how did you know I wouldn't be there?

17:34.936 --> 17:36.322
Lucky guess.

17:36.357 --> 17:38.140
Well, you'll never take me alive!

17:40.795 --> 17:42.063
Forgot my keys.

19:00.877 --> 19:02.468
I loved you, man.

19:02.641 --> 19:04.607
For the last few weeks,
but most of the time

19:04.608 --> 19:06.174
I've known you,
you've treated me like dirt.

19:06.475 --> 19:09.083
You hang on to recentment
like a good federate widow.

19:09.118 --> 19:11.367
I forgave you for accidentally killing my wife.

19:11.402 --> 19:13.705
Yeah, but you hold on to the big things.

19:13.940 --> 19:17.117
The point is, the more I got to know you,
the more I got to like you.

19:17.354 --> 19:21.391
I like you too. But you broke the law.
So I gotta bring you in.

19:21.381 --> 19:23.453
So it's gonna be like that, eh?

19:46.280 --> 19:47.778
I've got you my friend!

19:47.813 --> 19:49.763
Thanks, but what are you holding onto?

19:49.998 --> 19:50.506
I...

19:56.356 --> 19:59.224
Now all we have to do is get up,
before the concrete hardens.

20:02.679 --> 20:03.974
Oh, damn it!

20:05.874 --> 20:09.517
"Lest I come and smite the earth with a curse."

20:09.618 --> 20:11.111
Thus ends the book of Malachi.

20:12.033 --> 20:14.204
I guess I did know the whole
Old Testament by heart.

20:14.305 --> 20:15.955
Out with the old, in with the new!

20:15.990 --> 20:17.083
Testament that is.

20:17.178 --> 20:20.169
Matthew 1, The book of the
genealogy of Jesus Christ,

20:20.170 --> 20:24.789
the son of David, the son of Abraham.
Abraham became the father of Isaac.

20:24.824 --> 20:29.822
Isaac became the father of Jacob.
Jacob became the father of Judah and his brothers.

20:29.911 --> 20:34.052
Judah became the father of
Perez and Zerah by Tamar,...

20:34.153 --> 20:37.512
Simpson, we're gonna put you away
for a long long time.

20:37.647 --> 20:39.459
Make it life and you've got a deal.

20:41.190 --> 20:43.927
Don't feel too bad, Homie.
You'll be free tomorrow.

20:44.274 --> 20:51.807
And I used all my new baking skills to
make a special cake to remind you of me.

20:55.808 --> 20:57.166
Oh, baby.

21:00.973 --> 21:02.692
Thanks, Marge.
