[rattling]

00:16.683 --> 00:17.809
[engine shutting off]

00:20.020 --> 00:23.273
[singing, humming]

00:23.356 --> 00:25.900
Hey, fellas.
How you doing today?

00:25.984 --> 00:27.652
You're up early.

00:27.736 --> 00:30.071
[humming]

00:30.780 --> 00:32.448
Holy fuck!

00:34.075 --> 00:35.952
Hey, Randy, are you in there?

00:36.036 --> 00:38.038
I got your beer out here, bud.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.874
[Randy] Just leave it on
the deck, Bubbles.

00:40.957 --> 00:44.335
Well, I can't do that, Randy.
Your fucking steps are gone.

00:44.919 --> 00:46.004
[Randy] What?

00:46.087 --> 00:47.297
Your steps.

00:48.465 --> 00:50.800
Something was eating
your goddamn steps, bud.

00:50.884 --> 00:52.469
What the frig?

00:53.052 --> 00:55.680
Looks like there's blood
all over them, too. Look at that.

00:55.764 --> 00:58.016
Mr. Lahey, get out here
and check this out.

00:58.099 --> 00:59.768
That is blood.

00:59.851 --> 01:01.686
[Bubbles] Why the fuck
did I just taste that?

01:02.145 --> 01:03.188
What?

01:04.063 --> 01:05.482
Think it's raccoon?

01:07.358 --> 01:09.486
It's not raccoon, Randy.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.488
It's Rick-coon.

01:15.909 --> 01:18.703
Be careful, Ricky.
I don't want you to hurt yourself.

01:18.787 --> 01:21.206
Look, if it can't be fixed,
it just can't be fixed.

01:21.289 --> 01:23.792
No, no, I'll fix the cocksucker.
Don't worry.

01:23.875 --> 01:27.128
[Marguerite] Hey, Alvena!

01:27.212 --> 01:28.630
Lord lifted Jesus!

01:28.713 --> 01:31.049
You didn't hire
this fucking moron?

01:31.132 --> 01:35.345
He totally trashed my goddamn bathroom
putting up a fucking towel rack!

01:35.428 --> 01:37.847
Wasn't my fucking fault. I told you,
you'll get a brand new bathroom.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.974
Just waiting for some parts to come in.
Jesus Christ!

01:40.058 --> 01:42.143
[laughing]
When? Next summer on the ice?

01:42.227 --> 01:43.186
You dumb fuck!

01:49.067 --> 01:50.860
Fuck you two guys, too!

01:52.946 --> 01:54.781
Oh, my!

01:54.864 --> 01:57.909
What a coincidence!
We're missing deck boards

01:57.992 --> 02:00.286
and Ricky here is
redoing a fucking deck!

02:00.370 --> 02:01.788
These aren't your boards here,
cock welders.

02:01.871 --> 02:04.207
Not even the same colour.
Yours are brown, these are white.

02:05.250 --> 02:08.044
There's the proof right there, Mr. Lahey!
That's our deck colour.

02:08.127 --> 02:09.628
These are our boards.
I'm taking them back.

02:09.711 --> 02:11.422
You got no fucking proof.
Get the fuck off...

02:11.506 --> 02:13.216
-[Alvena] I don't want any trouble.
-Don't worry, Alvena.

02:13.299 --> 02:15.927
I'll have these two Hungarian
ass munchers out of here in 10 seconds!

02:17.512 --> 02:18.513
Frig off, Ricky!

02:18.596 --> 02:19.430
Fuck me...

02:19.514 --> 02:22.016
-Beat him... Rand. Take him, Randy!
-You want to fight?

02:22.100 --> 02:23.852
-The pants are coming off.
-Hold on a second.

02:23.935 --> 02:24.894
-[phone ringing]
-Right now!

02:24.978 --> 02:27.480
You take your fucking pants off.
Susan?

02:27.564 --> 02:31.484
I told you to stop fucking calling me.
I'm at work right now. I've gotta go.

02:31.568 --> 02:33.194
[Mr. Lahey] Randy! For fuck's sakes!

02:33.278 --> 02:35.405
I don't give a fuck
if you miss me, I miss you too.

02:35.488 --> 02:37.740
You're the one who said it's done,
why are you even calling me?

02:37.824 --> 02:38.992
-Get him, Randy.
-[grunt]

02:39.075 --> 02:41.786
-Huh?
-Frig off, Ricky!

02:41.870 --> 02:43.830
No, Susan.
That's not gonna fucking work, is it?

02:43.913 --> 02:46.791
Because it's never just
fucking dinner, is it? Never!

02:47.667 --> 02:48.793
Ah, fuck!

02:49.711 --> 02:51.754
Jesus Christ!
All right! Enough!

02:53.172 --> 02:55.008
Not you, codfish balls.
I'm talking to her.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.135
[grunting]

02:57.218 --> 02:58.553
Fuck!

02:58.636 --> 03:00.680
Susan, look,
I'll make fucking...

03:00.763 --> 03:03.182
I'll make dinner, and we can talk,
but that's fucking it.

03:03.266 --> 03:05.727
No banging. You've got to promise me that.
We can't.

03:07.854 --> 03:10.023
Susan, I don't even know
what the fuck that dish is.

03:10.106 --> 03:12.525
But sure, yeah, I'll make it. I can
make... fucking make anything.

03:12.609 --> 03:13.526
I'm a good cook.

03:14.110 --> 03:16.487
Come to my place at 6:00.
I got to go deal with something right now.

03:16.571 --> 03:19.741
-Come at 6:00. I've got to go. See you.
-Okay. Ricky!

03:19.824 --> 03:20.700
What?

03:20.783 --> 03:23.161
Things have been pretty fucking
peaceful around here.

03:23.244 --> 03:25.663
You keep rocking the shit boat
and I'll be more than happy

03:25.747 --> 03:28.082
to fucking broadside you
with a shit torpedo.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.250
Fuck off with the shit talk

03:29.334 --> 03:31.878
before I knock you out
and shit on your legs. How about that?

03:31.961 --> 03:33.504
-You're a dirty fighter, Ricky.
-Yeah?

03:33.588 --> 03:37.050
I fucking learned those moves from you,
you fucking dirty, hairy, grease beast.

03:37.133 --> 03:38.843
So get the fuck out of here!

03:39.135 --> 03:40.553
-Come on, Mr....
-Go!

03:42.305 --> 03:43.431
[Alvena] Ricky, don't worry about it.

03:43.514 --> 03:47.727
Look, they can come in and out
of my back door like they always did.

03:47.810 --> 03:50.396
Well, I guess that's your business,
not mine, but...

03:50.480 --> 03:52.857
No, no, you hired me to fix
the fucking thing...

03:52.941 --> 03:54.400
I'm gonna fix the fucking thing.

03:57.195 --> 03:59.072
Just a couple nails in here.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.074
[thud, clatter]

04:01.157 --> 04:02.367
Fuck!

04:02.492 --> 04:05.536
Ah, Satan's hard cock
right down my fucking throat!

04:05.620 --> 04:07.413
Are you fucking kidding me?

04:07.622 --> 04:09.999
Oh, fuck!

04:10.083 --> 04:12.418
[clattering]

04:12.502 --> 04:15.088
This is a fucking piece of shit.

04:15.171 --> 04:16.547
[glass shattering]

04:16.714 --> 04:17.673
Fuck!

04:17.757 --> 04:19.884
[Donnie] Jesus fucking Christ!

04:20.718 --> 04:22.762
Are you fucking kidding me?

04:24.597 --> 04:27.058
[theme music]

05:06.639 --> 05:09.684
Getting a job is the best thing
I've done for myself in a long time.

05:09.767 --> 05:11.853
Now I've got medical, I work alone,

05:11.936 --> 05:14.605
plus I get a 25% discount
at the food court.

05:14.689 --> 05:16.816
[chuckle] You know, it's funny.
When I was a kid,

05:16.899 --> 05:20.153
we used to come here all the time
and steal from the gumball machines and...

05:20.236 --> 05:21.988
look at me now.

05:23.031 --> 05:24.282
I've come a long way.

05:25.950 --> 05:28.536
Okay, who's ready to do
some shoplifting for me?

05:28.745 --> 05:29.996
Great enthusiasm, guys.

05:30.079 --> 05:31.664
Look, just steal
what's on the fucking list

05:31.748 --> 05:33.374
and you guys can take
something for yourself.

05:33.458 --> 05:35.168
This deal fucking sucks moose cock.

05:35.251 --> 05:36.836
Hey, you watch your fucking language.

05:37.253 --> 05:39.088
We're risking going to jail,
all we get to keep

05:39.172 --> 05:41.716
is something...
worth, like, fucking 20 bucks.

05:41.799 --> 05:42.967
What risk? Huh?

05:43.051 --> 05:45.762
Did you guys forget that I caught you
stealing in the first place?

05:45.845 --> 05:49.474
I can call your parents or the cops if
I want to, huh? Is that what you prefer?

05:49.557 --> 05:50.433
No.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.810
Okay. Here's what I'm gonna do.

05:52.894 --> 05:56.355
You guys can now take an item for
50 bucks for yourselves. Is that better?

05:56.439 --> 05:58.775
You can't even get a video game
for 50 bucks.

05:59.442 --> 06:02.904
Can I steal something for 75 bucks
if fucking Finn wants something for 25?

06:02.987 --> 06:04.363
Jesus Christ, what is this?

06:04.447 --> 06:06.616
Let's Make a Fucking Deal
or something? Huh?

06:06.699 --> 06:08.367
And we wanna steal
bigger things, too.

06:08.451 --> 06:10.745
Look, I got adults taking care
of the bigger things for me.

06:10.828 --> 06:12.914
-Thank you very much.
-This sucks!

06:13.623 --> 06:15.917
Look guys, you continue working hard
the way you are,

06:16.000 --> 06:18.669
maybe hit the gym, gain some weight,
some muscles,

06:18.753 --> 06:20.505
then you can work
yourself up the ladder.

06:20.588 --> 06:23.758
But until then, get what's
on my goddamn fucking list

06:23.841 --> 06:26.469
or you're fired, okay?
All right!

06:26.552 --> 06:27.553
Move it out!

06:29.263 --> 06:31.182
[Julian sighing]
Jesus Christ...

06:31.265 --> 06:33.559
Oh my fuck, you was something hard
with the kids.

06:33.726 --> 06:35.812
You've got to be, man.
They've got to fucking learn.

06:36.354 --> 06:38.731
-You guys all set?
-Let's roll, motherfuckers!

06:38.815 --> 06:40.358
I don't know, man.
This seems pretty wack.

06:40.441 --> 06:43.111
That's what I'm saying, man.
This seems pretty beneath us, dawg.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.904
What do you mean, beneath you?

06:44.987 --> 06:47.824
If it's not beneath me,
it's not beneath you guys.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.201
Or, you know, if you guys...
are afraid?

06:50.284 --> 06:51.619
Are you pussying out here?
Is that...

06:51.702 --> 06:53.579
-[laughter]
-Afraid? We ain't afraid.

06:53.663 --> 06:54.789
No, man. We ain't afraid, man.

06:54.872 --> 06:58.334
Okay. No one's afraid.
Let's get this going, boys. Right on.

06:58.417 --> 07:00.336
-All right, cool.
-Good luck. I got your backs.

07:00.419 --> 07:01.629
Let's do this, man.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.548
[sighing]
Fuck.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.718
Okay, we need eggs, Ricky.

07:07.802 --> 07:09.387
Definitely.

07:09.470 --> 07:11.639
No, we... we don't need cream.

07:11.722 --> 07:13.224
There's no cream in carbonara.

07:13.307 --> 07:16.102
Mo likes coffee cream in his cereal.
He's addicted to that shit.

07:16.185 --> 07:17.770
Well, we need parmigiano.

07:17.854 --> 07:20.356
This is the other thing me and Susan
don't have in fucking common.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.567
She likes all this French,
richie-type fucking foods.

07:22.650 --> 07:25.153
-I don't have anything to do with that.
-It's not French, it's Italian.

07:25.236 --> 07:27.697
It's cheese. The hard cheese.
Parmigiano.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.198
Parmesan? This shit?

07:29.282 --> 07:31.534
-Yes. Put that in.
-All right.

07:31.617 --> 07:33.744
Ricky, this whole thing with Susan...

07:33.828 --> 07:35.121
Like, I'll help you make this dinner,

07:35.204 --> 07:37.331
but I don't want you
getting back together with her.

07:37.415 --> 07:39.208
-I'm not.
-I think it's a bad fucking idea.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.376
I still have feelings for her.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.295
I shouldn't because all we do
is fucking fight.

07:42.378 --> 07:45.339
But the banging...
This stuff's so fucking good.

07:45.798 --> 07:47.467
-Ricky...
-Oh, God.

07:48.342 --> 07:50.094
[muffled] I love...
I love chip dip, man.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.054
I love it.
You want some?

07:52.930 --> 07:55.016
-Ricky...
-It's just so fucking expensive!

07:55.725 --> 07:57.852
So you're just... yeah...
You just put her back.

07:57.935 --> 08:01.147
Next person who buys it, two big
finger holes in it. No big deal.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.065
-Oh, yeah!
-We need bacon.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.275
Wakey-wakey time.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.152
-[aerosol hissing]
-Ricky! Ricky!

08:06.569 --> 08:07.570
Ohh...

08:08.529 --> 08:10.740
Have a little shot, Bubs.
Oh, yeah, baby!

08:10.823 --> 08:13.784
Put it back! I'm not doing whippets
in the fucking grocery store.

08:13.868 --> 08:14.911
Phew!

08:15.453 --> 08:17.163
Jesus Murphy.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.999
Okay, we need bacon, Ricky, and eggs.
Where's the eggs?

08:20.082 --> 08:21.250
Bacon!

08:22.043 --> 08:23.711
Beck...
Beck-oh-nay.

08:23.794 --> 08:25.671
Yes... Ricky!

08:25.755 --> 08:26.756
Oh, fuck. Sorry, man.

08:26.839 --> 08:28.799
You know what?
It's a force of habit. I forgot.

08:28.883 --> 08:30.635
I forget sometimes, right?

08:31.385 --> 08:32.636
Okay....

08:33.261 --> 08:35.264
-[indistinct shouting]
-[Ricky] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, shh!

08:35.472 --> 08:36.599
-[Bubbles whispering] What? What?
-[gun clicking]

08:36.682 --> 08:39.434
There's a fucking robbery going on.
I can't let this happen. This is wrong.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.520
-What? Ricky, just let it happen.
-Fuckin' assholes...

08:41.604 --> 08:43.773
[Bubbles] Ricky, don't get your... Ricky!

08:43.856 --> 08:45.358
Oh my fuck...

08:45.441 --> 08:46.859
Put the fucking gun down right now!

08:46.943 --> 08:49.237
-Put the fucking...
-[Julian] What the fuck are you doing?

08:49.320 --> 08:51.447
-Put the gun away.
-[Ricky] They're trying to rob the place!

08:51.531 --> 08:54.158
I know it's a rob.
They're working for me, you dumbass!

08:54.617 --> 08:55.701
-[Ricky whispering] What?
-[Julian whispering] Yeah...

08:55.785 --> 08:58.538
I was gonna split the money with you.
Get the fuck out of here!

08:59.455 --> 09:00.498
[shouting] All right!

09:00.873 --> 09:03.501
You wanna steal from this store,
you've gotta shoot me first.

09:03.584 --> 09:05.545
So do it or get the fuck out of here!

09:05.628 --> 09:07.964
-Do it! Now!
-This is fuckin' bullshit!

09:08.047 --> 09:09.423
Get out of here!

09:10.883 --> 09:13.094
Hi, everyone.
I'm Julian, head of security.

09:13.177 --> 09:16.180
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Everything's under control now.

09:16.264 --> 09:18.140
You can go back to shopping.
You're safe now.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.850
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

09:19.934 --> 09:22.186
-[sporadic applause]
-[Julian] Thank you.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.855
Julian? What the fuck just happened?

09:24.939 --> 09:27.233
I don't know. I guess he, uh...

09:27.775 --> 09:30.861
just didn't want a big shoot-out
or something. Something like that.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.697
You can ask him.
I don't know.

09:32.780 --> 09:35.783
You're a fucking hero, Ricky.
You just stopped a robbery!

09:36.993 --> 09:38.160
You stopped a robbery.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.537
That's what I do.

09:40.621 --> 09:43.958
Holy fuck.
I bet you're gonna be in the paper.

09:46.877 --> 09:48.045
[sizzling]

09:48.129 --> 09:50.298
-Hey, Ricky.
-[Ricky] Yo!

09:50.381 --> 09:52.174
You've just got to keep this simmering.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.884
The sauce is...

09:54.218 --> 09:56.345
oh, fucking perfect!

09:56.429 --> 09:58.681
Just keep it simmering,
don't let it burn.

09:58.764 --> 10:01.934
And then just boil up some noodles
when you're ready and you're all set, bud.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.769
[Ricky] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
where are you going?

10:03.853 --> 10:06.731
-You can't fucking leave yet.
-I gotta go make beer deliveries, Ricky.

10:06.814 --> 10:08.983
Bubbles, I don't how to cook
the long fucking noodles!

10:09.066 --> 10:11.193
You cook them the same way
you cook the short ones!

10:11.277 --> 10:14.030
You boil fucking water
and throw them in!

10:14.113 --> 10:15.156
For fuck's sakes!

10:15.239 --> 10:17.825
Ricky... oh, my God.
I know what you're doing in there.

10:17.908 --> 10:20.119
What? I'm just...
I'm brushing my teeth.

10:20.202 --> 10:22.079
-[tapping]
-Well, you missed a fucking few spots

10:22.163 --> 10:23.289
if you're brushing your teeth.

10:23.372 --> 10:26.959
They're all jammed full of chicken chips
and I can hear the friction.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.295
I was washing my... hands.

10:29.378 --> 10:31.797
Yeah, washing them on your wiener.

10:32.298 --> 10:33.215
-Look...
-Okay. You know what?

10:33.299 --> 10:35.217
I can't be around Susan
with a fucking loaded weapon.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.845
I need to have zero horniness, Bubs.
I don't trust my cock!

10:38.262 --> 10:39.347
Don't you fucking leave me here!

10:39.430 --> 10:44.185
Ricky, I'm not standing out here cooking
a meal for your crazy fucking girlfriend

10:44.268 --> 10:46.687
while you're in there waxing your dolphin.
I'm sorry.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.439
You're on your own, bud.

10:48.522 --> 10:50.024
-Are you fucking...
-[thud, clattering]

10:50.107 --> 10:51.651
-Don't you fuckin' leave!
-[Bubbles] Ricky!

10:53.277 --> 10:54.654
I'm a little bit worried about Ricky

10:54.737 --> 10:57.531
and just the sheer amount
of masturbating he's doing.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.617
I mean, that's a lot
of crankin' for one fella

10:59.700 --> 11:02.495
and I don't know the science
behind the replenishment.

11:02.578 --> 11:05.331
I mean, I don't know if he's depleting
his bone marrow or...

11:05.414 --> 11:07.833
You know,
where's it all come from, really?

11:09.293 --> 11:11.796
I don't know how people do this job
for a living, I mean,

11:11.879 --> 11:13.964
you're dealing with kids
in the food court getting in fights,

11:14.048 --> 11:16.550
you're dealing with bums
drinking Lysol in the bathrooms,

11:16.634 --> 11:18.469
you got people fighting
over clearance items.

11:18.552 --> 11:19.637
It's fucked.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.722
But I've got these
little deals on the side

11:21.806 --> 11:23.349
-that are kinda making up for...
-[cracking]

11:23.599 --> 11:25.142
-[Mr. Lahey] You take American?
-What the fuck?

11:25.226 --> 11:26.852
[clinking]

11:26.936 --> 11:28.312
[Mr. Lahey] Pay the man, Randers.

11:28.396 --> 11:29.522
Where'd you get that money?

11:30.314 --> 11:31.148
Julian!

11:32.316 --> 11:35.403
Uh, we, uh... we won it last night.
Long shot at the track.

11:35.486 --> 11:37.238
Well, that counts as income, so it's mine.

11:37.321 --> 11:39.281
Frig off, Julian!
You said half our wages.

11:39.365 --> 11:40.616
I'm taking half this as wages.

11:40.699 --> 11:42.785
I'm taking the other half
for not telling me about it.

11:43.285 --> 11:44.787
Look, you pull this shit on me again,

11:44.870 --> 11:46.580
I'm gonna fucking take you down.
You got it?

11:46.664 --> 11:48.082
-[clattering]
-You got it?

11:52.586 --> 11:55.131
Uh, we'll come back for this stuff later.

11:56.382 --> 11:57.675
Holy fuck.

12:00.052 --> 12:02.888
Can I help you guys?
What's all that stuff?

12:02.972 --> 12:05.141
Uh... we're the delivery boys.

12:06.642 --> 12:07.935
Delivery boys?

12:09.103 --> 12:10.187
[Trinity] Hey, Bubs!

12:11.605 --> 12:13.774
Hey, guys, what's going on?

12:13.858 --> 12:15.776
Hey Jacob, how was physio?

12:15.860 --> 12:17.403
Pretty good.
Can't complain.

12:17.486 --> 12:19.655
He can do all his exercises now.
I'm so proud.

12:19.738 --> 12:22.825
He's still in a lot of pain
but the doctors say he's on the mend.

12:22.908 --> 12:25.369
And we've just gotta keep him away
from that fucking Ricky.

12:25.828 --> 12:28.038
-Yeah, well you look good, Jacob.
-Thanks, Bubs.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.957
-Keep your chin up, bud.
-[awkward laugh]

12:30.040 --> 12:31.959
Well, I guess you don't have a choice,
do you?

12:32.042 --> 12:33.252
[chuckles]

12:33.461 --> 12:35.254
Yeah, careful there.
Careful.

12:35.337 --> 12:36.672
-Come on, dude.
-[Bubbles] Take it easy.

12:36.755 --> 12:37.673
-[thud]
-Ow! Fuck!

12:37.756 --> 12:41.010
Ah, shit! I'm so sorry, dude.
I keep forgetting you got that thing on.

12:41.552 --> 12:44.513
Cory, how in the flying fuck
can you forget he has it on?

12:44.597 --> 12:48.309
He looks like he has a fucking oil derrick
screwed into his shoulders.

12:49.310 --> 12:50.853
What's an oil derrick, dude?

12:51.353 --> 12:52.813
[sigh]

12:53.481 --> 12:55.399
-[Ricky] Hey!
-How good's this couch gonna feel?

12:55.483 --> 12:57.067
-No, no, no, no, don't sit down.
-[moaning]

12:57.151 --> 13:00.154
[Trinity] Dad, let him go!
Dad, let him go! You're hurting him.

13:00.237 --> 13:01.780
-[groaning]
-[Trinity] My God...

13:01.864 --> 13:04.992
Hang out in the bedroom or in the car
for an hour. Susan's coming over.

13:05.075 --> 13:07.161
Are you kidding me?
He needs to rest, Dad.

13:07.244 --> 13:09.538
He can rest out in the car.
It's really comfy. That cool, bud?

13:09.622 --> 13:11.832
-[groan]
-Sorry. I keep forgetting about that...

13:12.166 --> 13:13.000
Oh, man.

13:13.083 --> 13:15.211
-You're unbelievable.
-She just wants to talk in private.

13:15.294 --> 13:16.754
We're not getting back together.
I promise.

13:16.837 --> 13:18.130
[Trinity] Yeah, heard that one before.

13:18.214 --> 13:20.299
We're really thankful
that Dad lets us stay here,

13:20.382 --> 13:22.593
but it's a bit of a pain
when Susan comes over.

13:22.676 --> 13:25.012
All they do is fight and then have sex.

13:25.095 --> 13:27.515
-And it's...
-She's loud. She's really, really loud.

13:27.598 --> 13:29.558
Sometimes it lasts all night long.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.435
Right until the next morning.

13:31.727 --> 13:32.937
-Your dad's a champ, babe.

13:33.020 --> 13:35.189
-Eww!
-Geez, careful.

13:35.272 --> 13:36.440
[groan]

13:36.524 --> 13:38.400
Fuck, why does nobody not believe me?

13:38.484 --> 13:40.903
Because every time she wants your dick,
you give it to her.

13:40.986 --> 13:43.614
[Ricky] I'm not giving it to her today,
'cause I'm not fucking horny.

13:43.697 --> 13:45.032
-Ricky, you're always horny.
-That is true,

13:45.115 --> 13:47.743
but I de-hornied myself
four or five times, so we're good here.

13:47.826 --> 13:50.871
Gross. I don't know what you see
in that uppity Bedford bitch.

13:52.039 --> 13:54.333
I know what you see in her, dude.
She's pretty hot, man.

13:54.416 --> 13:56.835
I'd give her whatever she wants. Well,
I wouldn't give her whatever she wants,

13:56.919 --> 13:59.004
some things are off limits but...
[indistinct]

13:59.296 --> 14:00.714
Can I hang out a bit?

14:00.798 --> 14:02.216
Cory, get the fuck out.

14:02.299 --> 14:04.593
Go to the park and chase
some fucking tennis balls or something.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.136
Fucking Jesus.

14:11.892 --> 14:13.269
[grinder scratching]

14:13.519 --> 14:16.689
Donnie! I got your free case here, bud!

14:17.022 --> 14:19.400
It's right there.
I'm sorry I'm a little bit late, but...

14:19.483 --> 14:21.277
-[door opening]
-Better late than never I guess...

14:21.360 --> 14:22.403
[screaming] Fuck you!

14:22.486 --> 14:26.365
It's not better late than never,
you stupid cocksucker!

14:26.448 --> 14:28.200
-Okay, Donnie...
-I should be fucking wasted by now!

14:28.284 --> 14:30.119
Donnie, take a deep breath.

14:30.202 --> 14:32.371
I'll give you half price
on a case for the inconven--

14:32.454 --> 14:34.123
Ah, fuck off!

14:34.206 --> 14:36.667
Okay. Just fucking relax, would you?
Jesus!

14:38.711 --> 14:40.212
Where the fuck did you get that?

14:40.713 --> 14:42.840
That's my hammer.
I loaned that to Ricky.

14:42.923 --> 14:46.010
Oh, Ricky was using that fucking thing,
was he?

14:46.093 --> 14:49.054
Ho-ly fuck!
That cocksucker!

14:49.138 --> 14:51.849
Donnie, tuck your balls in if you're going
to be walking around the park.

14:51.932 --> 14:53.893
[Donnie screaming]
Smash my fucking window...

14:53.976 --> 14:56.979
Jesus, he's angry.
[Donnie] ...fuckin'... fuck!

14:58.230 --> 14:59.690
[Susan] Wow, this looks amazing.

14:59.773 --> 15:01.942
Thank you. I made everything
from scratch. Hmm.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.944
[soft music plays]

15:06.447 --> 15:07.948
Oh, my fucking God.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.075
Is something fucked up?

15:10.868 --> 15:13.829
-This is fucking amazing.
-Oh, good.

15:15.039 --> 15:16.790
It's actually making me...

15:17.833 --> 15:19.627
a little bit wet.

15:22.254 --> 15:23.547
Oh, really?

15:23.631 --> 15:26.300
-Mm-hmm.
-How wet is it making you?

15:26.675 --> 15:28.260
-I'm goddamn soaking.
-Ah! You know what?

15:28.344 --> 15:30.429
I can't do this. I knew
this was gonna fucking happen.

15:30.512 --> 15:33.223
We can't go there. You have to go.
I'll pack this up for you.

15:33.307 --> 15:35.768
-The fuck are you doing?!
-I can't do this!

15:35.851 --> 15:37.519
You're making the little guy
wanna come out and play.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.146
He's already been out to fucking play
seven, eight times.

15:39.229 --> 15:41.482
Don't know why he wants to come out,
but he does, 'cause of you.

15:41.565 --> 15:43.108
I can't go there. You gotta go.

15:43.192 --> 15:45.277
-Take it with you!
-No. Listen. No, I don't wanna go!

15:45.361 --> 15:47.071
Ricky, listen to me, baby.

15:47.363 --> 15:50.407
-I came here today to apologize to you.
-Yeah? For what?

15:50.741 --> 15:52.451
I know it wasn't you
who gave me chlamydia.

15:52.534 --> 15:54.787
It was my fucking
common-law fuck-face ex.

15:54.870 --> 15:56.956
I fucking knew it.
I told you it wasn't me!

15:57.039 --> 15:59.041
Yeah, but I'm done
with that guy for good now.

15:59.124 --> 16:00.793
Good. Good for you.
That's amazing.

16:00.876 --> 16:02.086
So...

16:02.169 --> 16:03.796
I was hoping that maybe...

16:04.630 --> 16:08.801
you would wanna go back
to our previous arrangements.

16:08.884 --> 16:10.886
Um, well...
I mean, I guess...

16:12.554 --> 16:14.264
I guess we could do that,

16:14.348 --> 16:17.643
but if we're gonna go there, Susan,
like, I need more than just banging, okay?

16:17.726 --> 16:20.729
Like, I need... I need to do
some real coupley-type stuff.

16:23.357 --> 16:24.733
What, like, in public?

16:25.150 --> 16:28.070
Yeah! Like, I think I would like
to maybe go to the movies some time

16:28.153 --> 16:31.824
or maybe go to a beach or get ice cream,
go to a restaurant, like...

16:31.907 --> 16:33.784
See, look at you.
Every fucking time!

16:33.867 --> 16:35.619
Why do I feel like the chick
in this relationship?

16:35.703 --> 16:36.954
I actually need those things!

16:37.037 --> 16:40.332
Well, Ricky, this was never
about us getting serious

16:40.624 --> 16:42.084
because I live with someone else.

16:42.167 --> 16:43.836
You got fucking shot the other day.

16:43.919 --> 16:46.463
And while I find that hot as fuck,

16:46.547 --> 16:49.133
I can't be associated with someone
with such a crazy lifestyle.

16:49.216 --> 16:51.427
I have... I have a real job, Rick!

16:51.510 --> 16:52.886
I have real responsibilities.

16:53.387 --> 16:55.597
I've got a real job too now.
And I have real responsibilities.

16:55.681 --> 16:58.183
So, you know, maybe we have
some shit in common you didn't know.

16:58.267 --> 16:59.351
Maybe it'll work!

17:00.019 --> 17:02.354
Ah, fuck it! Who cares? Whatever.
[pounding table]

17:03.147 --> 17:04.897
No, okay. Hang on.

17:05.898 --> 17:10.029
If you fucking promise me
to keep it low-key...

17:12.656 --> 17:14.324
we can try actually dating.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.202
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

17:18.704 --> 17:19.788
I can definitely promise that.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.540
I promise, like...
no more craziness.

17:23.166 --> 17:24.084
[softly] Okay.

17:26.962 --> 17:28.297
[Marguerite] Ricky?

17:28.756 --> 17:31.050
Ricky? Are you in there?

17:31.717 --> 17:33.802
I'm coming in for a shit, Ricky.

17:34.678 --> 17:35.929
[Ricky] Seriously, right now?

17:36.013 --> 17:37.723
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here, Marguerite.

17:37.806 --> 17:41.852
Oh! Well, pardon the interruption, folks,

17:41.935 --> 17:44.396
but somebody has to take
a shit and a shower

17:44.480 --> 17:46.148
in somebody else's house

17:46.231 --> 17:49.902
because somebody else didn't fix
my goddamn bathroom!

17:51.278 --> 17:54.031
And it is a pain in the cock-sucking,
fucking dick!

17:54.114 --> 17:55.699
I'm working on it.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.451
See, this is exactly
what I'm talking about!

17:57.534 --> 17:58.827
I'm just fixing her bathroom.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.246
It's nice to be good
to the seniors, right?

18:01.330 --> 18:03.582
-Yeah.
-Susan, look. I promise you...

18:04.166 --> 18:06.627
Get the fuck out of my trailer right now!

18:07.544 --> 18:11.006
Get the fuck out! You too, go!
Everything's gonna be fucking normal...

18:11.090 --> 18:13.342
[Donnie] Jesus fuckin' Christ!

18:13.425 --> 18:17.346
For fuck's sakes, you cocksucker,
is this your fucking hammer?

18:17.429 --> 18:19.723
-Fuck you, Ricky!
-[glass clattering]

18:19.807 --> 18:21.642
[overlapping screaming]

18:22.851 --> 18:26.313
I'll fuckin' kill you!
You fuckin' cocksucker!

18:26.396 --> 18:28.232
I will fucking kill you, Ricky!

18:28.315 --> 18:30.067
-Get the fuck out of my trailer!
-[knife piercing]

18:30.150 --> 18:32.194
-...fucker! Fuck you!
-Goddamn it!

18:32.277 --> 18:36.615
And I'm taking these motherfucking
chicken fingers...

18:36.698 --> 18:39.368
-Are you out of your fucking mind?!
-[Susan sobbing]

18:39.451 --> 18:40.369
[Donnie] Fu-u-uck!

18:40.452 --> 18:43.122
This is exactly what
I'm fucking talking about!

18:43.205 --> 18:44.790
-What the fuck happened?
-Oh, my fuck!

18:44.873 --> 18:46.416
-Ricky!
-[Sarah] Oh, shit!

18:46.500 --> 18:48.335
Ricky, are you okay?

18:48.418 --> 18:50.921
-Ricky, what the fuck happened?
-Donnie fucking stabbed me!

18:51.004 --> 18:55.092
-Oh, my fuck. Here, I'm gonna pull it out.
-Don't touch my fuckin' boyfriend, whore!

18:55.175 --> 18:57.136
He's got a fucking screwdriver
in his shoulder, you bitch!

18:57.219 --> 19:00.180
Un-huh? Well, he's my boyfriend.
Well, I'll take care of it.

19:00.389 --> 19:01.348
Don't you mean fuck buddy?

19:01.431 --> 19:04.726
Uh, no, actually. Ricky and I decided
to take things to the next level.

19:04.810 --> 19:08.355
So, uh, you're gonna be moving
the fuck out 'cause I'm moving in.

19:08.897 --> 19:10.232
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What?

19:10.691 --> 19:12.609
Well, am I your girlfriend or not?

19:12.693 --> 19:13.694
Uh...

19:14.194 --> 19:15.988
technically, yes, you are.

19:16.071 --> 19:18.365
-[sighing] Ricky, for fuck's sakes!
-Really?

19:18.782 --> 19:21.743
You are a fucking psychotic bitch.
Good luck, Ricky.

19:21.827 --> 19:25.205
I don't know what you're waiting for.
Giddy-up, you wretched cunt.

19:25.706 --> 19:26.957
[Bubbles] Oh...

19:27.207 --> 19:30.377
What the fuck did you just call me?

19:31.003 --> 19:33.005
I called you a cunt... cunt.

19:33.088 --> 19:34.423
[Bubbles whispering] Language!

19:34.506 --> 19:35.632
You know what?

19:35.966 --> 19:37.718
We don't say that word in this park.

19:38.927 --> 19:40.804
-[thud]
-Holy fuck, Sarah!

19:40.888 --> 19:42.598
You know what?
I've fucking had it with her!

19:42.681 --> 19:43.932
No! Sarah, calm down!

19:44.016 --> 19:46.476
Let's fucking go, you fucking bitch!

19:46.560 --> 19:48.687
[overlapping screaming]

19:52.149 --> 19:53.901
-Fuck you.
-Oh, fuck you!

19:54.526 --> 19:56.653
[Bubbles] Ricky! Ricky, oh my fuck!

19:56.737 --> 19:58.238
[thuds, mixed screaming]

19:59.531 --> 20:01.700
[Ricky] Holy fuck! Jesus Christ!

20:01.783 --> 20:03.368
-[Bubbles] Ricky!
-I'll fucking kill her!

20:03.452 --> 20:04.953
Get out of the fucking way, Rick!

20:05.204 --> 20:07.247
-Fuck off... ah!
-[Bubbles grunts, panicked]

20:07.331 --> 20:09.708
-Okay... girls!
-[mixed shouting]

20:10.375 --> 20:12.628
-[loud thud]
-[Bubbles] Oh-h-h! Devastating!

20:12.711 --> 20:14.463
[Ricky] Bubbles, get her
the fuck out of here!

20:14.546 --> 20:17.674
That's how we do it in Sunnyvale, you...
fucking cunt!

20:17.758 --> 20:20.677
-Go!
-Okay, Sarah, calm down! Oh, my fuck!

20:20.761 --> 20:21.845
-[panting]
-You okay?

20:22.221 --> 20:23.055
[softly] Yeah.

20:23.138 --> 20:25.182
Guess maybe I should go
to the fucking hospital.

20:25.265 --> 20:26.975
Oh, no.
Are you fucking kidding me?

20:27.059 --> 20:28.810
Get in the bedroom.
This is so fucking hot.

20:28.977 --> 20:30.437
-What are you talking about?
-You're stabbed.

20:30.520 --> 20:33.649
-I just got in a girl fight. Come on!
-It's gonna have to be from behind.

20:33.732 --> 20:36.610
-I can't fucking lay down like this.
-[Susan] Yeah, yeah, that's perfect.

20:36.693 --> 20:37.861
[Ricky] Jesus Christ.

20:38.612 --> 20:40.239
-[Ricky loudly] Ah, fuck!
-[toilet flushing]

20:40.322 --> 20:41.615
[Susan] Get out of those tearaways.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.618
-[Ricky] Hold the fuck on here!
-[Susan] Oh, baby. That's a lot of blood!

20:44.701 --> 20:45.827
[Ricky] Ow, fuck!

20:45.911 --> 20:50.582
Well... not the most relaxing place
to have a crap.

20:50.666 --> 20:52.417
[Susan] Yeah! No, lower!

20:54.878 --> 20:57.839
[Randy] I really think we need to
reconsider my suggestion from before

20:57.923 --> 21:00.926
and hire an assistant-assistant
trailer park supervisor.

21:01.009 --> 21:03.553
That way he could handle
all this bullshit, Mr. Lahey.

21:03.637 --> 21:05.889
We... we can't...
we can't afford it, Randy!

21:06.348 --> 21:10.477
Julian's probably gonna be in control
of us for the rest of our fucking lives.

21:11.186 --> 21:13.897
Randy... You're still young, Rand.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.358
Why don't you just take
the rest of our money

21:17.234 --> 21:19.987
and toddle off to San Cra-fisto?

21:20.070 --> 21:21.780
-Or some place like that.
-[ice scrunching]

21:23.115 --> 21:25.075
I'm not leaving you, Mr. Lahey.

21:25.158 --> 21:27.286
Look, there's gotta be some way.

21:28.704 --> 21:33.458
I tell you, I'd really like to hire
an assistant for you, Randy.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.043
Just the kind you want.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.504
I really, really, really,
really would, Randy.

21:37.921 --> 21:42.134
But we can't afford it
unless we take some of the money

21:42.217 --> 21:44.761
and put it back into the money
that we lost!

21:45.387 --> 21:47.264
You're talking about gambling again,
Mr. Lahey.

21:47.347 --> 21:49.057
No... No, just hear...
Rand, just hear me out.

21:49.141 --> 21:53.520
There's no way I'm letting you gamble any
more of this money on anything, Mr. Lahey.

21:53.603 --> 21:55.522
That's exactly what I'm saying, Randy.

21:55.605 --> 21:56.815
You should!

21:57.482 --> 22:00.444
You were incredible at the track
the other day, Randy.

22:00.527 --> 22:03.155
I have never seen anyone

22:03.238 --> 22:05.532
be able to pick horses
the way you do.

22:06.116 --> 22:09.578
You can be 100% in charge, Randy.

22:09.661 --> 22:11.747
You can do all the picking.

22:12.122 --> 22:14.416
I got complete faith in you, bud.

22:15.250 --> 22:16.960
-I was pretty lucky.
-Yeah.

22:17.502 --> 22:19.379
You've got a gift, Randy.

22:20.088 --> 22:21.214
And besides...

22:22.257 --> 22:23.884
the more time we spend at the track,

22:23.967 --> 22:27.012
the less time we have to spend here
in the park near Julian.

22:28.305 --> 22:30.223
Yeah. That's true.

22:32.893 --> 22:34.936
You're damn rights, it's true.

22:35.562 --> 22:36.646
Let's do it.

22:37.481 --> 22:39.149
-But I'm in control.
-Okay.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.985
I'm putting us on an allowance.

22:42.277 --> 22:43.987
100 bucks each per day.

22:44.488 --> 22:45.947
Does that include liquor?

22:46.531 --> 22:47.783
Yeah.

22:48.325 --> 22:50.243
Okay. I'll drink to that!

22:51.828 --> 22:54.206
-Stretch it out, Mr. Lahey.
-Here.

22:54.790 --> 22:57.000
You just did a little...
[muttering]

22:57.084 --> 22:59.336
-Randy, you just went like this. Randy?
-That's powerful.

22:59.419 --> 23:01.546
I know, but you went like this,
you went like this.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.215
-"Ooh." Do that again.
-You do that...

23:03.298 --> 23:04.841
Do that again,
do that again. Ooh...

23:04.925 --> 23:06.176
-I love you, Randy.
-Mr. Lahey!

23:06.259 --> 23:09.137
We're going to the track!
Let's go to the track!

23:09.221 --> 23:11.431
♪ We're going to the track
and we're never coming back ♪

23:11.515 --> 23:12.974
-[knocking on door]
-Come in.

23:13.809 --> 23:15.602
-[Sarah] Hey.
-Hey, what's wrong?

23:16.228 --> 23:19.481
I fucking hate that stupid bitch Susan
so fucking much.

23:19.564 --> 23:21.650
Ricky's so stupid.
He's never gonna break up with her.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.860
I know. I know. I heard he was
seeing her tonight.

23:23.944 --> 23:25.320
-Yeah.
-I just stay the fuck away.

23:25.403 --> 23:27.239
That's what I do.
She still over there?

23:27.322 --> 23:29.032
Ha! What do you think?

23:29.116 --> 23:30.617
[Ricky and Susan
moaning and screaming]

23:30.700 --> 23:32.619
-That's fucking greasy.
-Ugh! Yeah.

23:32.702 --> 23:34.246
And because of that,

23:34.329 --> 23:35.872
I don't have a place to stay tonight.

23:35.956 --> 23:37.541
Wow, that sucks.

23:37.833 --> 23:40.168
I was getting ready to go to bed.
I got to work in the morning.

23:40.252 --> 23:42.003
Julian... Can I just stay over,
please, for tonight?

23:42.087 --> 23:45.966
Sarah, I'd let you, but I'm a working man,
now. I've gotta get up early.

23:46.049 --> 23:47.384
What's all this shit?

23:47.676 --> 23:50.679
-I'm decorating the place.
-You've got a bunch of cool new stuff.

23:50.762 --> 23:53.765
Yeah, it's cool but it's overwhelming.
I don't know where to put it all.

23:54.015 --> 23:55.934
Okay. How about this?

23:56.309 --> 23:58.103
You let me stay over
just for one night

23:58.186 --> 24:00.522
and I'll help you redecorate
your whole place.

24:01.565 --> 24:02.774
-One night?
-Yeah.

24:02.858 --> 24:04.651
I can make it look
fucking amazing.

24:06.111 --> 24:08.155
All right.
Do you want a drink?

24:08.238 --> 24:09.823
Yeah, you're fucking right
I want a drink!

24:09.906 --> 24:10.824
Okay, let's get drunk.

24:10.907 --> 24:12.576
This shit is sweet.

24:14.161 --> 24:15.412
All right, you guys gotta go.
