Yeah, I know, I'm spoiling myself,

00:07.630 --> 00:09.531
but I'm depressed. Or
have you forgotten

00:09.565 --> 00:11.499
that Jake, my best
friend, is in prison?

00:11.534 --> 00:13.101
- Wait, Jake's in prison?
- Yeah!

00:13.135 --> 00:15.603
He and Rosa were framed for
a bunch of bank robberies

00:15.638 --> 00:16.838
by Lieutenant Hawkins.

00:16.872 --> 00:18.940
Oh, right. And where's Gina?

00:18.974 --> 00:21.176
On maternity leave! We were
all at her baby shower

00:21.210 --> 00:22.677
- last week.
- Okay.

00:22.711 --> 00:24.212
And why am I bleeding?

00:24.246 --> 00:25.847
I don't know, Hitchcock.

Oh, so you don't have all the answers.

00:27.716 --> 00:29.217
I'm bleeding because my piece-of-crap

00:29.251 --> 00:30.685
son-in-law bit me.

00:30.719 --> 00:32.153
Look, we all miss Jake and Rosa,

00:32.188 --> 00:33.855
which is why we have to
keep working the case.

00:33.889 --> 00:35.690
There has to be some
way to exonerate them.

00:35.724 --> 00:37.525
I've been looking, but
I can't find anything

00:37.560 --> 00:39.294

- "I can't find anything

and I don't know what to do":

00:41.063 --> 00:43.831
- title of your sex tape.
- What is happening

00:43.866 --> 00:45.133
- right now?!
- They caught Hawkins

00:45.167 --> 00:46.301
trying to flee the country.

00:46.335 --> 00:47.869
She confessed to everything,

00:47.903 --> 00:49.637
- and they let me out.
- Oh, my God,

00:49.672 --> 00:51.139
Jake, is it really you?
Are you really here?

00:51.173 --> 00:52.707

- What?

00:56.111 --> 00:57.545
Welcome back, Peralta.

00:57.580 --> 00:58.980
I just heard from the mayor.

- what's going on with your hair?

didn't want you to worry,

the brass got involved,

afterwards like a garnish.

- to deserve this?
- He beat the crap out of me.

13:50.416 --> 13:52.050
- How?
- More importantly, he keeps

13:52.085 --> 13:54.219
interfering with my business interests.

13:54.254 --> 13:55.554
But it's about my thing too, right?

13:55.588 --> 13:56.955
Of course.

13:56.990 --> 13:58.557
(MOUTHS WORD)

13:58.591 --> 14:01.960
How are you gonna do it? Shiv
him, shank him, stab him?

14:01.995 --> 14:04.129
Are those different?

14:04.163 --> 14:06.465
Oh, boy. Should I be asking

14:06.499 --> 14:08.400
- someone else to do this?
- No, no, no, no.

14:08.434 --> 14:10.068
It's fine. I'm gonna
prove myself to you.

14:10.103 --> 14:13.038
But what if instead of killing Wilson,

14:13.072 --> 14:14.706
we get him fired? That
way, you don't have

14:14.741 --> 14:16.141
another man's death on your conscience.

14:16.175 --> 14:17.476
Yeah, that doesn't bother me.

14:17.510 --> 14:19.077
No, of course not. Why would it?

14:19.112 --> 14:20.712
But if we murder him, there's gonna be

14:20.747 --> 14:22.347
an investigation, and that
could bring a lot of heat

14:22.382 --> 14:24.082
- down on you, you know?
- I can see that.

14:24.117 --> 14:25.417
But that's not how we usually
do things around here.

14:25.451 --> 14:27.085
Sure, but you know what else

14:27.120 --> 14:28.720
you didn't used to do around here...

14:28.755 --> 14:30.689
Sprinkle uncooked noodles
on top of your ramen.

14:35.528 --> 14:37.596
You're right. You're right.

14:37.630 --> 14:39.731
You've earned the benefit of the doubt.

(WHISPERING) Okay, here's the plan.

14:54.314 --> 14:56.081
Tank said Wilson beats up inmates,

14:56.115 --> 14:57.616
so all I have to do is
get him to attack me

14:57.650 --> 14:59.418
and then file a complaint
with the prison board.

14:59.452 --> 15:01.620
Sure, but whenever the
bulls attack us...

15:01.654 --> 15:04.089
Which happens all the time...
the security cameras

15:04.123 --> 15:05.624
are conveniently not working that day,

15:05.658 --> 15:08.026
so it's just your word against theirs.

15:08.061 --> 15:10.429
Well, lucky for me, I
have my own camera.

15:10.463 --> 15:12.564
It's the perfect plan. Hey, I've never

15:12.598 --> 15:14.099
been beaten up by a
prison guard before.

15:14.133 --> 15:15.634
They don't use that baton, do they?

15:15.668 --> 15:17.302
You seem pretty committed to this plan,

15:17.337 --> 15:19.137
so there's no real
benefit to me answering.

15:19.172 --> 15:20.372
Sounds good.

15:20.406 --> 15:21.807
So, you painted my apartment?

15:21.841 --> 15:24.142
Walls in "White Wisp,"
trim in "Honeymilk."

15:24.177 --> 15:25.610
- And you filed my taxes.
- You're getting

15:25.645 --> 15:27.379
- your maximum refund.
- And picked up

15:27.413 --> 15:29.214
- my abuela at the airport?
- Yes, I went and got her

15:29.248 --> 15:31.450
at the Philadelphia
International Airport in...

15:31.484 --> 15:33.251
- Pennsylvania.
- And you broke the news to her

15:33.286 --> 15:34.820
about how I got sent to prison
and she'll probably die

15:34.854 --> 15:36.455
- before I get out?
- Mm-hmm, had that

15:36.489 --> 15:38.056
- fun conversation.
- But it was all worth it

15:38.091 --> 15:40.592
for you, you poor little caged bird.

15:40.626 --> 15:42.327
Great, because I have
another favor to ask.

15:42.362 --> 15:43.729
- Another?
- Yeah, I need you

15:43.763 --> 15:45.097
to cancel my cable.

15:46.532 --> 15:47.799
That's it?

15:50.103 --> 15:51.503
That's easy.

15:51.537 --> 15:53.138
I've been on the phone for six hours

15:53.172 --> 15:55.140
and I just wanna cancel an account.

15:55.174 --> 15:56.508
Yes, you've mentioned the bundles

no, no!

No, Rodrigo!

All right, there's Wilson.

- Okay, great.

16:10.857 --> 16:12.090
What are you gonna do to get him angry?

16:12.125 --> 16:13.425
Well, I don't know him,

16:13.459 --> 16:14.693
so I'm not sure what buttons to push,

16:14.727 --> 16:16.595
but I'm sure if I try enough things,

16:16.629 --> 16:19.164
something will set him off.

16:19.198 --> 16:20.799
Excuse me, can I ask you a question?

16:20.833 --> 16:22.667
- Get back to your table.
- Yeah, you know, I would,

this way every day

17:26.699 --> 17:28.433
I didn't. I got everything.

17:28.468 --> 17:30.268
I even zoomed in for some close-ups.

Oh, thank God.

- Oh, I'll take that phone now.

17:40.705 --> 17:42.870
I heard an inmate and a guard
were having a fight.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.697
So I go to do what I normally do:

17:44.775 --> 17:46.943
- turn off the security cameras.
- Yup, cool policy.

17:46.977 --> 17:48.711
- This place is great.
- And that's when I noticed

17:48.746 --> 17:51.047
your cannibal pal
taping the whole fight

17:51.081 --> 17:53.082
with an illegal cell phone.
And what were you planning

17:53.117 --> 17:55.318
on doing with this?
Blackmailing Wilson?

17:55.352 --> 17:57.086
No, I was trying to save his life.

17:57.121 --> 17:58.721
- Ah, come on.
- Honestly.

17:58.756 --> 18:00.123
I was ordered by this guy, Romero.

18:00.157 --> 18:01.791
- I don't know his first name.
- Jeff?

18:01.826 --> 18:03.159
Really? Romero's first name is Jeff?

18:03.194 --> 18:04.994
- Yeah.
- Anyway, Jeff ordered me

18:05.029 --> 18:06.396
to kill Wilson, but I
convinced him to let

18:06.430 --> 18:08.264
your guy live if I got
him fired instead.

18:08.299 --> 18:10.166
Why do you want him to lose his job?

18:10.201 --> 18:12.135
- He's a good man with a family.
- I mean, he did stomp

18:12.169 --> 18:14.237
- on my head a bunch of times.
- Those were warning stomps.

18:14.271 --> 18:16.339
What are you, part of
Romero's crew now?

18:16.373 --> 18:18.808
No, I was trying to get in.
That's what the video was for,

18:18.843 --> 18:20.310
- but obviously, it didn't work.
- All right.

18:22.446 --> 18:24.747
- I'll fire Wilson.
- Really?

18:24.782 --> 18:26.416
- Why?
- Romero's responsible

18:26.450 --> 18:28.251
for most of the illegal stuff
that goes on in this prison.

18:28.285 --> 18:29.986

it's not great in here

- That is so true.
- I know.

18:38.229 --> 18:40.430
- They have a hard time.
- It's a problem.

18:40.464 --> 18:42.966
Regardless, I won't snitch, okay?

18:43.000 --> 18:44.801
It's too dangerous. I'll
find some other way

18:44.835 --> 18:45.935
- to stay alive.
