WEBVTT

00:01.400 --> 00:02.799
Previously on Elementary...

00:02.830 --> 00:04.320
On the off chance
you haven't already

00:04.370 --> 00:05.519
been contacted by Hemdale,
your son

00:05.570 --> 00:07.265
left rehab
a little early this morning.

00:07.300 --> 00:10.064
Mr. Holmes, did your father
tell you about me or not?

00:10.110 --> 00:11.463
He made_ his conditions
qurte clear.

00:11.510 --> 00:13.398
I use, I wind up
on the street.

00:13.440 --> 00:15.374
You consult for Castle
Automotive Systems,

00:15.410 --> 00:17.401
do you not?
Nope, not anymore.

00:17.450 --> 00:19.714
You got into a shouting match
with their lead designer

00:19.750 --> 00:21.445
over his refusal to address
certain glitches

00:21.480 --> 00:23.311
you'd identified,
and then you got sacked.

00:23.350 --> 00:24.783
Are you my friend, Sherlock?

00:24.820 --> 00:26.287
Yes, I'm your friend.

00:26.320 --> 00:28.117
No, you're not.
You're an addict.

00:28.160 --> 00:30.128
I'm your sponsor. That's it.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.286
We were a good team.

00:31.330 --> 00:32.820
I was a consumer of narcotics,

00:32.860 --> 00:35.522
and you were someone with access
to pharmaceutical-grade product.

00:35.560 --> 00:36.822
You don't call that a team?

00:36.870 --> 00:39.338
What's that?
_It's contact
Information

00:39.370 --> 00:41.167
for Hemdale
Rehabilitation Facility.

00:41.200 --> 00:42.508
That's very nice of you.

00:42.540 --> 00:44.508
I bear some
responsibility for you.

00:44.540 --> 00:46.337
But mark my words,

00:46.380 --> 00:48.507
if I do see you again,
make sure it's because

00:48.540 --> 00:50.269
you're ready
to make reparations of your own.

00:50.310 --> 00:51.800
I'm firing you.

00:51.850 --> 00:54.375
What?
You're sacked.

00:54.420 --> 00:55.614
You're terminated.

00:55.650 --> 00:58.619
Unlike Castle,
I will not defame you.

00:58.650 --> 01:01.483
But suffice it to say,
you're no longer my sponsor.

01:03.430 --> 01:05.079
All right, what's
the guy's name on third base?

01:05.130 --> 01:06.358
No, What's on second.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.424
Who's on second?
Who's on first.

01:07.460 --> 01:08.654
I don't know.
He's on third.

01:08.700 --> 01:10.497
(audience laughs)
See what I mean?

01:10.530 --> 01:12.395
I didn't even mention
the guy's name on third base!

01:12.440 --> 01:13.566
Yes, you did.

01:13.600 --> 01:15.090
All right, then who's
playing third base?

01:15.140 --> 01:16.232
No, Who's on first.

01:16.270 --> 01:17.430
I'm not asking you
what's on first!

01:17.470 --> 01:18.437
What's on second.
Who's on second?

01:18.470 --> 01:19.869
Who's on first.
I don't know.

01:19.910 --> 01:21.104
He's third base...

01:21.140 --> 01:22.744
You're not laughing.

01:22.780 --> 01:24.475
Neither are you.

01:24.510 --> 01:26.478
In truth, I am moved
nearly to tears.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.875
"Who's on first?" is the most
perfect Joke ever told.

01:28.920 --> 01:31.548
I told you,
I grew up on these guys.

01:31.590 --> 01:33.581
Channel 11 used to run
their movies every Sunday.

01:33.620 --> 01:36.327
I also have the one
with Frankenstein's monster.

01:36.360 --> 01:38.351
Can we just
watch this one?

01:41.830 --> 01:43.695
The purpose of this exercise
was to prevent you

01:43.730 --> 01:45.288
from torturing yourself.

01:45.330 --> 01:47.537
Rhonda said
she might e-mail me tonight.

01:47.570 --> 01:49.333
I can assure you, she will not.

01:51.340 --> 01:52.739
Let's review the facts.

01:52.780 --> 01:54.338
You were together
for two months.

01:54.380 --> 01:56.348
She got a job in Vancouver.

01:56.380 --> 01:59.144
And then she made it quite clear
she was not interested

01:59.180 --> 02:00.408
in a long-distance relationship.

02:00.450 --> 02:02.384
Everything's evidence to you.

02:02.420 --> 02:03.614
What is existence

02:03.650 --> 02:05.686
but the absorption of
and reaction to

02:05.720 --> 02:07.654
the data
that the universe presents?

02:07.690 --> 02:09.726
You can either grasp
these truths,

02:09.760 --> 02:11.648
or you can misinterpret them

02:11.690 --> 02:13.555
to your constant
and considerable agitation.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.625
What base do you want
to talk about?!

02:15.660 --> 02:17.264
Case in point.

02:18.530 --> 02:20.498
Well, I appreciate
the distraction

02:20.540 --> 02:22.508
and the philosophy, but...

02:22.540 --> 02:23.905
I got an early day tomorrow.

02:23.940 --> 02:26.238
Crazy client needs,
uh, an alarm

02:26.280 --> 02:29.545
and a transmission,
so I should take off.

02:29.580 --> 02:31.172
(grunting sigh)

02:31.210 --> 02:32.575
You're going to e-mail her,
aren't you?

02:32.620 --> 02:35.578
I don't know.

02:35.620 --> 02:37.747
Third base.

02:39.420 --> 02:41.217
You can nix
the popped corn, Watson.

02:41.260 --> 02:43.751
Alfredo has departed.

02:43.790 --> 02:45.621
Movie night is off?

02:45.660 --> 02:47.457
Let's just say
the moment has passed.

02:47.500 --> 02:50.298
(sighs) Did you guys get into
an argument or something?

02:50.330 --> 02:51.922
Yes, he insisted

02:51.970 --> 02:54.564
that his favorite professional
athlete was superior to mine.

02:54.600 --> 02:57.205
I questioned his sanity, because
we're both ten years old.

02:57.240 --> 02:59.299
I'm just saying, this
friendship thing is pretty new.

02:59.340 --> 03:01.205
Well, the progression
from sponsorship

03:01.240 --> 03:02.673
is going quite nicely,

03:02.710 --> 03:04.200
but my only quibble
is that, for the moment,

03:04.250 --> 03:06.218
I remain sponsor-free.

03:06.250 --> 03:07.808
(microwave beeps)

03:07.850 --> 03:09.442
But with any luck,
the issue should be

03:09.490 --> 03:10.639
resolved in the morning.

03:10.690 --> 03:13.284
Oh, are you
auditioning someone?

03:13.320 --> 03:15.288
Alfredo says there's
a promising candidate

03:15.320 --> 03:17.788
who attends a meeting
near his garage.

03:19.660 --> 03:20.820
I changed my mind.

03:23.570 --> 03:25.458
MAN:
I told you.

03:25.500 --> 03:29.459
It's a mint-condition
1973 Charger SE.

03:29.510 --> 03:31.466
Yes, I'm sure it was stolen.

03:31.510 --> 03:33.569
By a guy named Alfredo Llamosa.

03:33.610 --> 03:36.545
No Y, two Ls.

03:36.580 --> 03:39.572
Fine, I'll be here.

03:39.620 --> 03:40.644
You work here?

03:40.680 --> 03:41.977
I do not.

03:42.020 --> 03:43.385
But Alfredo's a
friend of mine.

03:43.420 --> 03:44.648
Can I... can I help you?

03:44.690 --> 03:46.681
Unless you know where
he went with my Charger,

03:46.720 --> 03:48.256
no, you can't.

03:48.290 --> 03:50.258
He was replacing your
transmission, was he not?

03:50.290 --> 03:52.258
Perhaps he took it
out to test it.

03:52.300 --> 03:53.722
Nah, I just bought
that car.

03:53.760 --> 03:55.955
And I _told him
under no Circumstances

03:56.000 --> 03:57.661
was anyone to drive it.

03:57.700 --> 03:58.667
Tried calling him?

03:58.700 --> 03:59.894
Five times.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.692
Goes straight to voice mail.

04:01.740 --> 04:03.401
(line rings)

04:03.440 --> 04:04.930
(recorded):
You've reached Alfredo Llamosa.

04:04.970 --> 04:07.507
Leave your name and number...
He left these doors open?

04:07.540 --> 04:09.872
Did you hear the part
about me not being able

04:09.910 --> 04:11.639
to get a hold
of him?

04:27.830 --> 04:29.969
*

05:04.700 --> 05:06.668
WATSON:
Maybe he dropped it.

05:06.700 --> 05:08.361
There's tread marks
on the back of it.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.560
Someone put it
on the concrete

05:09.610 --> 05:12.067
and stamped on it
quite deliberately.

05:12.110 --> 05:13.805
You think he walked in
on a robbery?

05:13.840 --> 05:15.034
Well, if he did,
where is he now?

05:15.080 --> 05:17.048
Maybe the thief
hurt him,

05:17.080 --> 05:19.674
put him in the trunk of the car
that he was working on,

05:19.720 --> 05:20.675
and then drove away.

05:20.720 --> 05:23.109
You're positing Alfredo is dead.

05:23.150 --> 05:24.947
No, I-I don't want to...
There's no sign of a struggle.

05:24.990 --> 05:27.311
There's no sign
the scene has been cleaned.

05:29.090 --> 05:31.081
You're worried
he relapsed.

05:31.130 --> 05:35.590
Something may have caused
him to destroy his own phone

05:35.630 --> 05:37.359
and make off with
a client's car.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.027
How did he seem
last night?

05:39.070 --> 05:41.391
He recently parted
ways with a lover.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.408
But other than that, he
seemed in fair spirits.

05:43.440 --> 05:46.375
Then again, Alistair was in fair
spirits the last time I saw him.

05:46.410 --> 05:47.604
He died of
an overdose.

05:47.640 --> 05:50.370
I'd like to speak
to the captain,

05:50.410 --> 05:52.002
explain my relationship
to Alfredo

05:52.050 --> 05:54.848
and his recent problems with
Castle Automotive Systems.

05:56.050 --> 05:57.608
You think maybe
they were involved.

05:57.650 --> 05:59.515
He embarrassed them,

05:59.560 --> 06:01.915
and they're the closest
thing he has to an enemy.

06:03.460 --> 06:04.688
Where you gonna be?

06:04.730 --> 06:07.494
Someone I need to talk to.

06:09.060 --> 06:11.426
(doorbell rings)

06:11.470 --> 06:13.563
Sherlock.

06:13.600 --> 06:15.067
What brings you here?

06:15.100 --> 06:16.806
Alfredo, actually.

06:18.510 --> 06:22.549
Can you believe that was him?

06:22.580 --> 06:25.071
I look at that picture
all the time.

06:25.110 --> 06:27.544
I think about that little boy,

06:27.580 --> 06:30.185
everything he has
in front of him.

06:30.220 --> 06:34.111
I think, "If he only knew."

06:34.160 --> 06:36.788
_So when was the last
time you spoke to him?

06:36.830 --> 06:39.128
Sunday. He came
to church with me.

06:39.160 --> 06:42.459
Did he mention any problems
he was having?

06:42.500 --> 06:46.732
If he was having any problems,
he didn't share them with me.

06:46.770 --> 06:49.500
He was just being himself,

06:49.540 --> 06:52.429
doing his work,
going to his meetings.

06:52.480 --> 06:54.471
How are you doing?

06:54.510 --> 06:56.649
Me?
Mm.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.500
You okay?

06:59.720 --> 07:02.143
Yeah.

07:03.620 --> 07:05.838
I've been
in this situation before.

07:05.890 --> 07:08.916
I've had this conversation
before.

07:10.190 --> 07:12.590
Alfredo got high again.

07:12.630 --> 07:16.464
Alfredo's going to prison again.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.058
It hurts.

07:18.100 --> 07:20.694
Every time,
it hurts, but...

07:20.740 --> 07:23.004
I know what to do with it now.

07:23.040 --> 07:24.803
Do you?

07:26.780 --> 07:29.499
You-you seem quite certain
that if he is in trouble

07:29.550 --> 07:31.177
that it's of his own making.

07:31.210 --> 07:33.849
I'm not.

07:33.880 --> 07:37.179
But if life with my son
has taught me one thing,

07:37.220 --> 07:39.859
it's that you need to be ready
for anything.

07:39.890 --> 07:42.211
If he did fall,

07:42.260 --> 07:45.252
I don't want him dragging you
down with him.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.724
He wouldn't
want it, either.

07:48.930 --> 07:50.227
When you told me you wanted

07:50.270 --> 07:51.567
to talk to me
about Alfredo Llamosa,

07:51.600 --> 07:53.136
I thought it was
because the police

07:53.170 --> 07:54.728
had finally actually

07:54.770 --> 07:56.601
caught the guy
breaking into a car.

07:56.640 --> 07:58.232
Instead, you accuse me
of hurting him?

07:58.270 --> 08:00.977
It's not like you don't
have motive, Mr. Kopeclq.

08:01.010 --> 08:03.274
You were fired because
of Alfredo Llamosa.
Whoa.

08:03.310 --> 08:05.505
Castle Automotive
didn't fire me.

08:05.550 --> 08:08.178
We had a parting of the ways.
It was mutual.

08:08.220 --> 08:10.939
We talked to some of your
ex-colleagues this morning.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.719
They told us
that you were badmouthing

08:12.760 --> 08:14.182
Alfredo to his other clients.

08:14.220 --> 08:15.949
You said he was using drugs.

08:15.990 --> 08:18.026
Do you know for a fact
he wasn't?

08:18.060 --> 08:20.290
What we know is that there was
a string of car thefts.

08:20.330 --> 08:21.627
All the cars

08:21.660 --> 08:23.799
had Castle alarm systems
in them.

08:23.830 --> 08:26.799
Someone was trying to make
the company look bad.

08:26.840 --> 08:29.229
Someone? Are you serious?

08:29.270 --> 08:30.305
We know you thought
it was Alfredo,

08:30.340 --> 08:31.705
but you couldn't prove it.

08:31.740 --> 08:33.230
Eventually,
it occurred to your bosses

08:33.280 --> 08:35.578
that you might be the real
problem, so they let you go.

08:35.610 --> 08:37.009
BELL:
Can you account

08:37.050 --> 08:38.608
for your whereabouts
between the hours

08:38.650 --> 08:40.242
of 8:00 last night
and 8:00 this morning?

08:40.280 --> 08:43.215
Well, let's see. I guess I
was kidnapping and dismembering

08:43.250 --> 08:45.241
a drug addict.
Mr. Kopecky.

08:45.290 --> 08:47.554
No. He's the criminal, not me.

08:47.590 --> 08:48.909
You want to ask me
any more questions,

08:48.960 --> 08:49.927
you get my attorney
down here.

08:49.960 --> 08:51.621
Maybe he can talk me out of

08:51.660 --> 08:52.649
suing your asses.

08:52.700 --> 08:54.019
WATSON:
So, after all that,

08:54.060 --> 08:55.288
looks like the only thing

08:55.330 --> 08:57.992
Neil Kopecky may be guilty of
is being an ass.

08:58.030 --> 09:00.169
I take it that was
the captain who rang?

09:00.200 --> 09:01.565
Kopecky's lawyer

09:01.600 --> 09:03.329
finally got him
to give straight answers.

09:03.370 --> 09:04.803
Turns out, after he got fired,

09:04.840 --> 09:06.979
he had to move back in
with his parents.

09:07.010 --> 09:08.671
They have
a security system there.

09:08.710 --> 09:10.849
It showed he got home
at 6:00 last night

09:10.880 --> 09:12.848
and didn't leave until
we called him this morning.

09:12.880 --> 09:15.269
That only proves he wasn't
directly responsible.

09:15.320 --> 09:17.618
I know. So I thought
you and I could pay him

09:17.650 --> 09:19.618
a visit tomorrow,
you could see what you think.

09:19.660 --> 09:21.309
Did the lab find any prints
on Alfredo's phone?

09:21.360 --> 09:22.759
Just Alfredo's.

09:22.790 --> 09:24.155
And the Dodge Charger?

09:24.190 --> 09:26.624
It's still missing.

09:26.660 --> 09:28.298
Oh, my God.

09:28.330 --> 09:30.161
Is this Alfredo?

09:30.200 --> 09:32.020
I've been reviewing his
prior criminal history

09:32.070 --> 09:34.868
in the hopes that
it might yield another suspect.

09:34.900 --> 09:37.835
What do you mean?
We know Alfredo

09:37.870 --> 09:39.269
to be an expert car thief,

09:39.310 --> 09:41.005
but when his addiction
made it difficult

09:41.040 --> 09:43.042
to_ meet the technical
reqUIrements of that work,

09:43.080 --> 09:44.342
he turned to a more traditional

09:44.380 --> 09:47.019
brand of crime.
He mugged someone.

09:47.050 --> 09:48.847
Three someones, to be exact.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.313
One man even ended up
in hospital.

09:50.350 --> 09:52.011
Well, do you really think

09:52.050 --> 09:54.018
it's one of these people
coming after him?

09:54.060 --> 09:55.857
I mean, after all this time?

09:55.890 --> 09:57.983
I'd be remiss ifI didn't
consider the possibility.

09:58.030 --> 10:00.021
Unfortunately, these records
only denote the crimes

10:00.060 --> 10:01.652
for which Alfredo was caught.

10:01.700 --> 10:03.395
For all we know, there
might be dozens more

10:03.430 --> 10:05.591
that went undocumented.

10:09.740 --> 10:12.675
How are you holding up?

10:12.710 --> 10:15.235
Question of the day, that is.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.703
(phone ringing)

10:26.860 --> 10:29.181
Hello?

10:29.220 --> 10:32.428
MAN:
Hey, old buddy. Guess who.

10:32.460 --> 10:33.859
Oscar.

10:33.900 --> 10:35.697
Long time no speak, huh?

10:35.730 --> 10:37.368
How did you get this number?

10:37.400 --> 10:40.892
I need your help, man.
It's my sister, Olivia.

10:40.940 --> 10:43.067
I can't find her.
It's been a couple days now.

10:43.110 --> 10:44.407
Go to the police.

10:44.440 --> 10:46.738
I'm not someone_
the cops take real serious.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.372
Don't call this number again.

10:48.410 --> 10:50.708
We can talk about Alfredo.
What?

10:52.210 --> 10:55.077
Your buddy. Alfredo.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.918
I hear he's been tough
to get a hold of.

10:57.950 --> 10:59.918
What are you talking about?

10:59.960 --> 11:01.689
What do you think
I'm talking about?

11:02.860 --> 11:04.919
Listen to me very carefully,
Oscar.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.689
If you know something
about Alfredo...

11:06.730 --> 11:08.721
I know I'm the one who took him.

11:10.000 --> 11:12.127
There's a diner at 19lst Street
and Amsterdam.

11:12.170 --> 11:14.092
I want you to meet me here.

11:14.140 --> 11:16.290
You help me find my sister,

11:16.340 --> 11:19.730
maybe you'll see Alfredo alive
again.

11:26.480 --> 11:28.175
He actually went?

11:28.220 --> 11:29.312
He didn't have a choice.

11:29.350 --> 11:31.045
There's always a choice.

11:31.090 --> 11:33.183
There's us.
We're his friends.

11:33.220 --> 11:37.350
Look, Oscar taped this under
a mailbox near the brownstone.

11:37.390 --> 11:40.188
Do you honestly think I
could've talked him out of it?

11:40.230 --> 11:42.152
Llamosa's got to have,
what, 50 pounds on this guy?

11:42.200 --> 11:43.428
At least.

11:43.470 --> 11:46.325
So how did he get
Llamosa to go with him?

11:46.370 --> 11:48.691
He said he borrowed a gun
from a friend.

11:50.210 --> 11:52.360
So your partner not only
took off with a kidnapper,

11:52.410 --> 11:55.004
he took off
with an armed kidnapper?

11:55.040 --> 11:57.474
The gun doesn't work. At least,
that's what Oscar told Sherlock.

11:57.510 --> 11:59.307
He said he was gonna trade it

11:59.350 --> 12:00.749
for Sherlock's phone
once they met up.

12:00.780 --> 12:02.247
And the reason
this guy's doing all this

12:02.280 --> 12:04.419
is he wants Holmes
to help him find his sister?

12:04.450 --> 12:06.111
Olivia. I don't know
anything else about him.

12:06.150 --> 12:07.811
Neither does Sherlock.

12:07.860 --> 12:09.953
But he doesn't think
that's who we should

12:09.990 --> 12:11.218
be focusing our
attention on.

12:11.260 --> 12:13.296
We know who took Llamosa now.

12:13.330 --> 12:15.798
Sherlock said he's not worried
about Oscar. He can handle him.

12:15.830 --> 12:19.789
Joan.
While Sherlock is with Oscar,
we can dig into him.

12:19.840 --> 12:20.989
We can go to the
place where he squats,

12:21.040 --> 12:22.462
talk to the people
that he knows.

12:22.500 --> 12:25.799
There could be a trail
that leads directly to Alfredo.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.808
Say there is. Say we find him.

12:27.840 --> 12:30.400
How are we gonna let him know
his buddy's okay?

12:30.450 --> 12:32.406
Sherlock said
he would figure it out.

12:32.450 --> 12:34.179
He just wants us
to help Alfredo.

12:34.220 --> 12:35.972
That's great.
We can do that.

12:36.020 --> 12:38.818
But tell me this--
he gets into trouble,

12:38.850 --> 12:40.488
who's gonna help him?

12:42.860 --> 12:45.181
(slurps)
Mmm, mmm.

12:45.230 --> 12:47.221
Mmm.

12:48.530 --> 12:50.498
You want something?

12:52.070 --> 12:55.164
Your sister--
you said you want to find her.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.430
Me and Olivia,
we got a lot in common.

12:57.470 --> 13:00.177
(chuckles)
H, for example.

13:01.480 --> 13:03.539
She's an addict, then.

13:07.850 --> 13:09.886
She's my baby sister.
Only 24.

13:09.920 --> 13:12.115
We grew up
in the same house,

13:12.150 --> 13:14.118
got smacked around
by the same guy.

13:14.160 --> 13:15.957
She came
to see me last month.

13:15.990 --> 13:18.879
Told me that she'd had a scare.
She wanted to get clean.

13:18.930 --> 13:21.558
So I got her into rehab.
A couple days ago, she calls me,

13:21.600 --> 13:22.521
says she's checking out.

13:22.560 --> 13:25.063
Mmm. Mmm.

13:25.100 --> 13:27.193
She's all better and she
doesn't need it anymore.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.538
I told her to stay,
serve the whole sentence,

13:29.570 --> 13:32.266
but she wouldn't listen.

13:32.310 --> 13:35.973
So why have you gone
to such lengths to find her?

13:36.010 --> 13:39.400
We fought. I told her
she was making a mistake.

13:39.450 --> 13:41.418
She hung up on me.

13:44.650 --> 13:46.618
And then I got to thinking.

13:46.650 --> 13:48.959
You know, a junkie in this city,

13:48.990 --> 13:51.857
well, that's a needle
in a haystack.

13:51.890 --> 13:54.597
That's a job
for Sherlock Holmes.

13:54.630 --> 13:57.599
So why didn't you ask me?

13:59.630 --> 14:04.363
You remember the last time
we saw each other?

14:04.410 --> 14:08.130
What was it you called me?

14:08.180 --> 14:11.900
A sickening means
to a sickening end.

14:13.580 --> 14:16.845
That sound like someone
you're gonna help?

14:19.050 --> 14:21.416
You help me find Olivia,

14:21.460 --> 14:25.089
get her back into rehab,
your buddy walks.

14:28.100 --> 14:30.989
Alfredo's got nothing
to do with this.

14:31.030 --> 14:33.669
So let him go,
and I'll find your sister.

14:33.700 --> 14:35.497
No, Sherlock...

14:35.540 --> 14:37.337
I'll even help you
evade arrest for kidnapping.

14:37.370 --> 14:39.907
No...
I'll give you money.
What do you want?

14:39.940 --> 14:41.532
No.

14:41.580 --> 14:45.505
I didn't do this
so you could lie to me.

14:45.550 --> 14:48.974
I did this
so you would find Olivia.

14:51.320 --> 14:54.118
Oh, you want to hurt me?

14:54.160 --> 14:58.950
Oh, man,
do you want to hurt me.

14:58.990 --> 15:02.994
I'm fragile, Sherlock.
You know, I'm sick. I got hep C.

15:03.030 --> 15:06.124
And you remember my bum ticker,
right? I got the endocarditis.

15:06.170 --> 15:08.434
You could be rough with me,
but then I might die.

15:08.470 --> 15:10.961
Then who's gonna tell you
where your friend is?

15:11.010 --> 15:15.674
You know? Who's gonna save him
before he starves to death?

15:15.710 --> 15:17.177
There are methods of torture

15:17.210 --> 15:20.418
that even your pathetic frame
could endure.

15:21.520 --> 15:23.147
Try me.

15:25.690 --> 15:28.215
You said your sister called you.

15:28.260 --> 15:30.524
She doesn't have a cell phone,
if that's what you're wondering.

15:30.560 --> 15:32.152
Nothing your cop buddies
could track.

15:32.190 --> 15:33.726
Doesn't have an apartment,
either.

15:33.760 --> 15:36.058
Before the rehab,
she was living on the streets.

15:36.100 --> 15:38.728
Right, then.

15:38.770 --> 15:42.331
I suggest we begin our search
at her rehab facility.

15:42.370 --> 15:43.701
I was thinking the same thing.

15:43.740 --> 15:46.231
See if anyone there knows
where she was headed.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.305
The name of the facility?

15:50.350 --> 15:52.204
You're gonna laugh.

15:55.550 --> 15:57.643
How long were you here?

15:57.690 --> 15:59.988
A week?
A month?

16:00.020 --> 16:02.318
A year?

16:02.360 --> 16:04.988
I'm not really a fan
of sharing, Oscar.

16:05.030 --> 16:07.225
I have no intention
of opening up now.

16:07.260 --> 16:09.228
(chuckles,
sniffs)

16:09.260 --> 16:11.091
Still.

16:11.130 --> 16:15.692
It's got to bring back
memories, right?

16:15.740 --> 16:20.006
For a guy like you
to come to a place like this...

16:20.040 --> 16:21.371
(whistles)

16:23.510 --> 16:26.343
...you must have
been in bad shape.

16:29.280 --> 16:33.057
Am I to assume you chose Hemdale
because of my recommendation?

16:33.090 --> 16:35.058
Not only your recommendation.

16:35.090 --> 16:36.682
You paid for it.

16:36.720 --> 16:40.690
You remember that standing
reservation that you left me?

16:40.730 --> 16:42.721
(chuckles)

16:42.760 --> 16:46.264
I made a few calls,
pretended to be your attorney.

16:46.300 --> 16:48.268
Managed to convince
the brass here

16:48.300 --> 16:50.439
that it was really
for an O. Rankin.

16:50.470 --> 16:53.439
Olivia, not Oscar.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.675
I didn't think you'd mind.

16:55.710 --> 16:58.440
I knew the bills would
come to your daddy anyway.

16:58.480 --> 17:00.778
(scoffs)

17:00.820 --> 17:03.482
How is he,
by the way?

17:05.290 --> 17:07.087
Still a billionaire?

17:07.120 --> 17:09.156
(door opening)

17:09.860 --> 17:11.748
HOLMES:
Kamala Ruger.

17:11.790 --> 17:13.428
Hi. My name
is Sherlock Holmes.

17:13.460 --> 17:16.020
_ I'm a consultant
With the police department.

17:17.100 --> 17:19.125
Who let you in my room?

17:19.170 --> 17:21.263
Uh, we sort of let ourselves in.
We need
your a55istance.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.063
You were,
until very recently,

17:23.110 --> 17:25.135
sharing this room
with Olivia Rankin,

17:25.170 --> 17:26.364
correct?

17:26.410 --> 17:28.799
This is Olivia's
brother, Oscar.

17:30.180 --> 17:31.772
She had a picture of you.

17:31.810 --> 17:33.539
Did something happen to her?

17:33.580 --> 17:35.775
Oscar hasn't been able
to get in touch

17:35.820 --> 17:37.708
with Olivia for a few days.

17:37.750 --> 17:39.786
We were wondering if she had
said anything to you

17:39.820 --> 17:41.651
about where _
she was planning on gomg.

17:43.760 --> 17:45.580
You guys really break in here?

17:45.630 --> 17:48.121
Ms. Hegler
at the front desk invokes

17:48.160 --> 17:51.266
a rather rigid interpretation
of patient confidentiality.

17:51.300 --> 17:53.336
So I thought
I'd wait here.

17:53.370 --> 17:55.338
You could scream
and have us thrown out.

17:55.370 --> 17:58.828
Or you could help Olivia reunite
with a family member who's just

17:58.870 --> 18:01.373
trying
to help her.

18:02.440 --> 18:04.874
Hegler's a bitch.

18:04.910 --> 18:06.878
There's gonna be
a bed check soon.

18:06.910 --> 18:08.571
We should go outside.

18:12.290 --> 18:14.850
She was nice. _
Easy to get along With.

18:14.890 --> 18:17.723
I'm kind of a veteran
of the process,

18:17.760 --> 18:19.853
so I could tell _
she wasn't gonna make it.

18:19.890 --> 18:21.551
She just
wasn't ready.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.898
So can you tell us
where to find her or not?

18:23.930 --> 18:25.761
When she told me
she was leaving, I tried

18:25.800 --> 18:27.859
to talk her out of it,
but she said it was too late.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.697
She already had
this friend coming

18:29.740 --> 18:32.903
to pick her up. Uh... Beta.

18:32.940 --> 18:35.135
Beta?
She used
to call him

18:35.180 --> 18:36.272
Beta Ray in group.

18:36.310 --> 18:38.141
Someone she used to
get high with.

18:39.410 --> 18:40.672
Was there anything else?

18:40.720 --> 18:42.210
That's all
I know.

18:42.250 --> 18:44.218
I got to go.

18:44.250 --> 18:46.411
I get caught,
they take away my TV privileges.

18:46.450 --> 18:48.554
Good luck.

18:48.590 --> 18:51.388
Thank you.

18:51.430 --> 18:52.852
I'm gonna go out on a limb

18:52.890 --> 18:55.450
and say
that Beta Ray is a street name.

18:55.500 --> 18:58.389
I propose a brief suspension
of your rules.

18:58.430 --> 18:59.897
Let me contact Watson.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.898
She can search for it
in the NYPD database.

19:01.940 --> 19:03.931
Sherlock, buddy,

19:03.970 --> 19:06.632
what do you need a database for
when you got Oscar Rankin?

19:06.670 --> 19:09.173
You're familiar with Beta Ray?

19:09.210 --> 19:10.643
(scoffs)
Not just that.

19:10.680 --> 19:13.478
I got a good idea
where to find him.

19:14.980 --> 19:17.540
There was another set of works
in the medicine cabinet.

19:17.590 --> 19:20.354
I found this taped
to the mirror.

19:20.390 --> 19:22.688
Just no sign of Alfredo Llamosa.

19:22.720 --> 19:24.688
No.

19:24.730 --> 19:27.699
I find it hard to imagine
Oscar would've brought him here.

19:27.730 --> 19:29.948
I mean, it's right
off a main road,

19:30.000 --> 19:32.195
public stairwell.

19:33.570 --> 19:37.836
Well... strange to see
Oscar looking so happy.

19:39.310 --> 19:41.733
Actually, it's a little scary.

19:41.780 --> 19:43.338
How's that?

19:43.380 --> 19:46.577
Well, I've spent a lot of time
with addicts.

19:46.610 --> 19:49.579
The ones who manage to hold
on to a sibling or a friend,

19:49.620 --> 19:50.917
those relationships

19:50.950 --> 19:53.919
take on so much importance.
Makes you wonder

19:53.960 --> 19:56.212
how far he'd be willing to go
to find her.

19:56.260 --> 19:58.888
Yeah. Exactly.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.558
Huh.

20:04.600 --> 20:06.568
What is it?

20:08.040 --> 20:10.235
Blood?
I don't think so.

20:10.270 --> 20:12.261
I just don't love
that it was in the garbage.

20:12.310 --> 20:15.279
Well, if he used it
to hurt Alfredo,

20:15.310 --> 20:18.245
why would he come back to
his apartment to get rid of it?

20:18.280 --> 20:19.941
We are dealing
with a heroin addict.

20:19.980 --> 20:21.948
Still don't know
if he's been here recently,

20:21.980 --> 20:23.413
but I'm gonna bag this.

20:25.290 --> 20:27.281
(rattling)

20:34.960 --> 20:36.518
He has been here.

20:40.600 --> 20:43.967
BELL:
'73 Dodge Charger.

20:45.840 --> 20:47.899
He's not here.

20:47.940 --> 20:50.943
But he probably was.
Looks like he was trying

20:50.980 --> 20:52.379
to get out of here.

20:52.410 --> 20:53.809
WATSON:
We should call in more police--

20:53.850 --> 20:55.715
do an area search,

20:55.750 --> 20:56.944
canvass the
neighborhood.

20:56.980 --> 20:58.618
Maybe we'll
get lucky.

20:58.650 --> 21:01.050
I'll call, but we'd
have to be real luclq.

21:01.090 --> 21:03.354
Far as we know,
Oscar had this car for, what,

21:03.390 --> 21:05.358
a good 12 hours
before he called you guys.

21:05.390 --> 21:07.699
He could've stashed Alfredo
damn near anywhere.

21:11.500 --> 21:13.798
Maybe not anywhere. I just
found this under the seat.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.365
Dilby's?
It's a burger chain.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.038
I've only ever seen
them in Long Island.

21:18.070 --> 21:19.867
Look, the grease
is still fresh.

21:19.910 --> 21:22.071
So sometime after
Oscar took Alfredo

21:22.110 --> 21:23.646
but before he ditched
the car here,

21:23.680 --> 21:26.740
he went to Long Island?
Why would he do that?

21:38.890 --> 21:41.688
You implied you knew
where Beta Ray lived.

21:41.730 --> 21:44.699
No, I said I knew where
we could find him.

21:44.730 --> 21:46.595
So this is a heroin den?

21:46.630 --> 21:48.336
(short chuckle)

21:48.370 --> 21:50.861
Those are bad for people
in recovery, huh?

21:53.040 --> 21:55.873
Sucks
to be you.

22:06.050 --> 22:08.018
OSCAR:
Hey.

22:08.060 --> 22:10.585
My buddy said
Olivia and Beta Ray

22:10.630 --> 22:11.927
were here the other night.

22:11.960 --> 22:14.656
Beta's supposed
to be back tonight.
VVhen?

22:15.900 --> 22:17.663
Tonight.

22:17.700 --> 22:20.692
Because heroin _a_ddicts_
have such reliable itineraries.

22:20.740 --> 22:23.937
Looks like we're just
gonna have to wait it out.

22:52.930 --> 22:54.830
Oh, yeah, those are
my buddy Mickey's.

22:54.870 --> 22:55.962
He picks pockets.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.059
Those are some
of his trophies.

22:58.110 --> 23:00.704
Sit down, man.
Take a load off.

23:00.740 --> 23:03.004
Relax.

23:03.040 --> 23:05.042
Come on.

23:08.550 --> 23:10.882
Hey, you remember
that Christmas?

23:10.920 --> 23:12.979
You hadn't been in
New York very long.

23:13.020 --> 23:14.908
You were all down in the
dumps about that chick.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.848
Eileen.

23:16.890 --> 23:19.029
No, uh,
was it Irene?

23:19.060 --> 23:22.723
Either way, Christmas Eve.

23:22.760 --> 23:23.988
I come to your place

23:24.030 --> 23:26.919
to check up on
you, and you...

23:26.970 --> 23:30.098
I find you all balled
up on the floor.

23:30.140 --> 23:32.108
Yeah, sobbing.

23:32.140 --> 23:34.938
Remember?

23:34.980 --> 23:37.107
Not really.

23:37.140 --> 23:40.109
I held you.

23:40.150 --> 23:42.118
Yeah, man.

23:42.150 --> 23:44.846
I promised
I'd take care of things.

23:44.890 --> 23:46.778
Get you straight.
And I did.

23:47.990 --> 23:51.050
I took you to a place
just like this.

23:51.090 --> 23:52.921
I was good to
you, Sherlock.

23:52.960 --> 23:54.621
I was your
friend.

23:54.660 --> 23:57.527
You were a cancer to me,
Oscar, and I to you.

24:01.270 --> 24:04.205
You should have seen him
at the garage this morning.

24:04.240 --> 24:06.458
Alfredo.

24:06.510 --> 24:09.035
Yeah.

24:09.080 --> 24:11.969
He was... He was so nice.

24:12.010 --> 24:13.978
You know, even with
a gun in his face,

24:14.020 --> 24:16.875
he kept telling me to 5...
You know, "Stay calm.

24:16.920 --> 24:19.684
I don't want any trouble."

24:19.720 --> 24:22.553
I get why you
like him.

24:22.590 --> 24:24.581
But anyway...

24:30.730 --> 24:33.119
May I remind you
we have business here.

24:33.170 --> 24:34.831
Yeah, find
Beta Ray.

24:34.870 --> 24:37.600
I told you what he looks like.

24:37.640 --> 24:39.904
Shaved head,
spider tattoo right here.

24:43.040 --> 24:44.576
Don't take off
on me, okay?

24:44.610 --> 24:46.749
I wake up and you're
gone... (exhales)

24:46.780 --> 24:48.714
I'd hate to
be Alfredo.

24:48.750 --> 24:51.787
And compared to where he is,
this place is the Ritz.

24:51.820 --> 24:53.048
(laughs softly)

24:53.090 --> 24:54.751
BELL:
Okay, got him.

24:54.790 --> 24:56.587
Opening them up now.

24:58.660 --> 25:00.059
the property.
Said he hadn't seen

25:00.090 --> 25:03.526
or talked to Oscar Rankin
in two years.

25:03.570 --> 25:05.595
I don't think you're gonna see
any hostages we missed

25:05.630 --> 25:06.961
in the pictures, but this way,

25:07.000 --> 25:08.831
you don't have to take
our word for it.

25:08.870 --> 25:09.996
No, I'm sure
you're right.

25:10.040 --> 25:11.667
We appreciate you
guys taking a look.

25:11.710 --> 25:13.007
You got it.

25:13.040 --> 25:14.905
We'll keep an eye out
for Rankin and Llamosa.

25:14.940 --> 25:16.134
All right, thanks.

25:16.180 --> 25:18.239
Police out on the island?

25:18.280 --> 25:19.941
Suffolk County.

25:19.980 --> 25:22.676
Oscar Rankin has an
uncle out in Wyandanch.

25:22.720 --> 25:24.847
Clark Folsom.
Posted bail

25:24.890 --> 25:26.983
for Oscar a couple times
in 2011, and his house

25:27.020 --> 25:30.626
is about a mile from a Dilby's,
so it seemed like a good lead.

25:30.660 --> 25:32.252
Rankin have any other
family out there?

25:32.290 --> 25:34.190
He and_ his sister
grew up in that area,

25:34.230 --> 25:36.289
but it doesn't look like
anyone else is still around.

25:36.330 --> 25:38.992
A few of the guys have
been helping make calls.

25:39.030 --> 25:42.261
Wake up all the Dilby's owners
and collect surveillance videos.

25:42.300 --> 25:43.938
We were just gonna
see how they're doing.

25:43.970 --> 25:45.198
(cell phone rings)

25:45.240 --> 25:47.060
Oh, I'll be with you guys
in a minute.

25:49.380 --> 25:51.041
Hello?

25:51.080 --> 25:52.308
HOLMES:
Watson.

25:52.350 --> 25:54.910
Hey. Tell me you're okay.

25:54.950 --> 25:56.838
Still with Oscar, unfortunately.

25:56.880 --> 25:58.848
He's resting at the moment.

25:58.890 --> 26:00.710
What number
are you calling from?

26:00.760 --> 26:02.284
Well, I didn't get
the owner's name.

26:02.320 --> 26:04.185
She, too, is unconscious.

26:04.230 --> 26:05.754
Where are you?

26:05.790 --> 26:08.293
Fordham Heights.
Shooting gallery.

26:08.330 --> 26:10.059
Sherlock.

26:10.100 --> 26:11.920
We're awaiting
a friend of Olivia's.

26:13.870 --> 26:15.132
How goes your search?

26:15.170 --> 26:16.831
We found the car.

26:16.870 --> 26:18.963
We think Oscar
drove it to Long Island,

26:19.010 --> 26:21.308
possibly to stash Alfredo,
but beyond that...

26:21.340 --> 26:24.104
I may be able to better
focus your efforts.

26:24.150 --> 26:26.277
There are some stains
on Oscar's coat.

26:26.310 --> 26:28.369
Most of those stains
are transmission fluid.

26:28.420 --> 26:31.389
But there's also some powder--
the kind of dust

26:31.420 --> 26:33.285
which is created
when you cut stone.

26:33.320 --> 26:37.654
Marble or granite, most likely.

26:37.690 --> 26:39.385
WATSON: If the fluid
is from Alfredo's garage,

26:39.430 --> 26:42.820
that means Oscar hasn't changed
his clothes today.

26:42.860 --> 26:44.919
The dust might be from
wherever he left Alfredo.

26:44.970 --> 26:46.267
Could be a construction site

26:46.300 --> 26:48.996
or a quarry
or a tile warehouse.

26:49.040 --> 26:50.667
I'll let Marcus
and the captain know.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.405
We'll get people out
to any places that match.

26:52.440 --> 26:55.329
Keep me apprised of any
developments via text.

26:55.380 --> 26:57.974
I think maybe
you should come in.

26:58.010 --> 26:58.977
No.

26:59.010 --> 26:59.977
If Oscar thinks that taking you

27:00.010 --> 27:01.113
to a shooting gallery is

27:01.150 --> 27:02.811
gonna help you
find his sister,

27:02.850 --> 27:04.010
he's not just deranged,
he's an idiot.

27:04.050 --> 27:05.745
He's also the only person

27:05.790 --> 27:07.018
who knows for certain
where Alfredo is.

27:07.050 --> 27:08.881
Sherlock...

27:08.920 --> 27:11.127
Yes, triggers abound here.

27:11.160 --> 27:13.890
So do all the other trappings
of the heroin lifestyle.

27:13.930 --> 27:16.398
I'm no closer to using
than I was yesterday.

27:16.430 --> 27:18.625
Be in touch.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.217
Hey.

27:40.250 --> 27:41.911
Wake up.

27:47.160 --> 27:49.958
What is this?
Is Beta Ray here?

27:50.000 --> 27:51.797
No.

27:51.830 --> 27:53.024
Then what is it?

27:53.070 --> 27:55.129
We're leaving.

27:55.170 --> 27:57.263
I told you--
we go when I say we go.

27:57.300 --> 28:00.064
This belongs to Jonathan Bloom.

28:00.110 --> 28:02.806
See how clean it is compared to
the others hanging over there?

28:02.840 --> 28:05.149
That's because he was
here two nights ago.

28:05.180 --> 28:08.149
Same night your sister was
here. Your friend Mickey

28:08.180 --> 28:09.841
just confessed to relieving him
of his wallet.

28:09.880 --> 28:11.211
So?

28:11.250 --> 28:13.047
So I'm familiar with Mr. Bloom,

28:13.090 --> 28:14.853
or at least the rumors
surrounding him.

28:14.890 --> 28:16.858
It's possible Olivia
left with him.

28:16.890 --> 28:18.323
If she did, we haven't got

28:18.360 --> 28:20.385
a second to lose.

28:23.400 --> 28:25.368
You guys don't
look like cops.

28:25.400 --> 28:28.392
As I explained to your doorman,
I'm a consultant for the NYPD.

28:28.440 --> 28:31.261
This man... consults me.

28:33.040 --> 28:35.201
Well, come in, tell me
what I'm alleged to have done

28:35.240 --> 28:37.231
this time.

28:43.350 --> 28:46.842
You don't really seem
too surprised to see us.

28:46.890 --> 28:49.484
I've grown accustomed to a
certain baseline of harassment

28:49.520 --> 28:51.750
when it comes to the police.

28:51.790 --> 28:54.099
But my patience
is not without its limits,

28:54.130 --> 28:57.019
so ask what you're here to ask
and let me get back to bed.

28:57.060 --> 28:59.426
Mm. I, myself, have, uh, been
aware of your reputation

28:59.470 --> 29:01.165
for a few years now. Yeah.

29:01.200 --> 29:04.033
I followed your
story in the news.

29:05.440 --> 29:07.772
Something tells me
I shouldn't be flattered.

29:07.810 --> 29:10.802
I've not been tracking
your business triumphs.

29:10.850 --> 29:12.340
I've been following
your other stories.

29:12.380 --> 29:16.043
Those persistent rumors
surrounding your proclivities.

29:16.080 --> 29:18.810
That you like young women
who can't fight back.

29:18.850 --> 29:21.956
Women that you hand-pick from
nightclubs and drug dens,

29:21.990 --> 29:25.118
who do what you want
in exchange for a fix, you know.

29:25.160 --> 29:28.220
Women who, on one or two
occasions, have just...

29:28.260 --> 29:30.057
never been seen again.

29:30.100 --> 29:31.795
Then you must also know

29:31.830 --> 29:34.037
that those rumors
have never been proven.

29:34.070 --> 29:35.799
There's a
conspicuous lack

29:35.840 --> 29:37.262
of security cameras
in your building.

29:37.300 --> 29:39.359
I'm assuming it's because
the owner-- you--

29:39.410 --> 29:41.173
wants it that way.

29:43.110 --> 29:45.305
I think it's time
you explained why you're here.

29:45.350 --> 29:49.468
A young woman,
Olivia Rankin...

29:49.520 --> 29:52.080
went missing two nights ago
from a heroin den

29:52.120 --> 29:54.111
where you were seen.

29:55.490 --> 29:57.185
You lost this there.

29:59.260 --> 30:01.228
She's not here.
Nobody is.

30:06.100 --> 30:07.988
(exhales)

30:08.040 --> 30:10.235
Well, obviously that's mine.

30:10.270 --> 30:13.933
But I can't say
I've seen the girl.

30:13.980 --> 30:16.369
Look, I don't know
where I lost that,

30:16.410 --> 30:19.277
but come on, I certainly
wasn't in some heroin den.

30:19.310 --> 30:21.870
(yells, groans)

30:21.920 --> 30:24.844
Olivia Rankin!
Tell us everything.

30:24.890 --> 30:26.084
I met her in a building
in Fordham Heights

30:26.120 --> 30:27.087
the night before last.

30:27.120 --> 30:28.189
You brought her here?

30:28.220 --> 30:29.118
Yes, but she
robbed me.

30:29.160 --> 30:31.219
She's the one who-who
messed up my arm.

30:31.260 --> 30:32.352
Explain that.

30:32.390 --> 30:34.255
I thought she was
up for a party.

30:34.300 --> 30:35.255
You assaulted her?

30:35.300 --> 30:37.052
No, she attacked me.

30:37.100 --> 30:38.965
She fought back.
She took my stash

30:39.000 --> 30:40.297
and some loose
money and ran.

30:40.330 --> 30:41.934
I called the doorman
to try to stop her,

30:41.970 --> 30:43.858
but it was too late--
he'd already put her in a car.

30:43.910 --> 30:45.366
Aah! It was a service.

30:45.410 --> 30:47.298
_ I'll tell them to
give you the name.

30:47.340 --> 30:50.229
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

30:50.280 --> 30:52.271
Every available cop

30:52.310 --> 30:56.041
for 20 miles, Nassau and Suffolk
PDs has been searching.

30:56.080 --> 30:59.208
Construction sites,
tile stores, hardware stores.

30:59.250 --> 31:01.616
We are running out
of places to look.

31:01.660 --> 31:03.582
I'm thinking maybe we should
go have a conversation

31:03.620 --> 31:06.020
with Oscar's uncle ourselves,
see if we can shake

31:06.060 --> 31:08.324
something out of him
the other guys missed.

31:12.170 --> 31:13.319
Hey.

31:13.370 --> 31:15.463
Don't even go there.

31:15.500 --> 31:18.298
I'm not. It's just...

31:18.340 --> 31:20.501
That photo of Alfredo
that Oscar left us--

31:20.540 --> 31:22.371
it only proved he was
alive yesterday morning.

31:22.410 --> 31:24.207
If Oscar didn't

31:24.250 --> 31:25.899
leave him somewhere safe,
if he wasn't careful...

31:25.950 --> 31:28.339
We can't come at it that way.
Not yet.

31:28.380 --> 31:31.019
But like I was saying, we could
pay a visit to the uncle--

31:31.050 --> 31:33.086
_ Folsom--
apply a little more pressure.

31:37.460 --> 31:39.382
Headstone engravers.

31:39.430 --> 31:41.295
That's another place
where they cut marble.

31:41.330 --> 31:43.457
There's a lot of them on
this part of the island.

31:43.500 --> 31:46.196
There's a lot of
cemeteries out here.

31:46.230 --> 31:50.269
You know, those photos
from his uncle's house...

31:50.300 --> 31:53.906
There was a jacket
draped over a chair.

31:56.610 --> 31:58.339
"South Shore."

31:59.710 --> 32:02.543
"South Shore Memorials."

32:02.580 --> 32:05.117
(Oscar scoffs)

32:05.150 --> 32:08.415
You sure that driver
didn't just rip us off?

32:08.460 --> 32:11.088
This is where
he said he brought her.

32:11.130 --> 32:13.189
No reason to lie.

32:13.230 --> 32:16.290
Uh, $50 fare's a
pretty good reason.

32:16.330 --> 32:19.595
If that was the case, he could
have taken us much further.

32:19.630 --> 32:22.269
We know from Bloom
that her pockets were full

32:22.300 --> 32:24.461
of freshly stolen,
high-grade heroin.

32:24.510 --> 32:29.504
Perhaps she just wanted a safe,
dry place to sample the goods.

32:29.540 --> 32:33.101
You know there might be
more addicts in there, right?

32:33.150 --> 32:36.449
More people using.

32:36.480 --> 32:39.278
What's your point?

32:39.320 --> 32:41.311
Oh, this doesn't
bother you?

32:41.360 --> 32:43.681
The shooting gallery
last night?

32:43.720 --> 32:45.529
(chuckles)

32:45.560 --> 32:47.687
Seeing everything
that you saw?

32:49.460 --> 32:52.122
Wow. You're, like... what,
you're, like, cured now?

32:52.170 --> 32:54.764
That's one of the dumbest things
I've ever heard you say,

32:54.800 --> 32:57.166
and I've known you a long time.

32:58.710 --> 33:01.235
(sniffing)

33:01.280 --> 33:02.577
What?

33:04.080 --> 33:06.344
Wait here.
Why?

33:06.380 --> 33:08.644
Just do as I say.

33:20.390 --> 33:22.392
*

33:41.450 --> 33:43.509
What is it?
What's wrong?

33:43.550 --> 33:45.188
(train cars chugging on tracks)

33:45.220 --> 33:47.211
So what was all this about?

33:47.250 --> 33:48.615
What was the purpose?

33:48.660 --> 33:50.787
What are you
talking about, purpose?

33:50.820 --> 33:53.220
Well, Olivia's dead.

33:53.260 --> 33:56.149
She has been
for two days.

33:56.200 --> 33:58.065
You've known

33:58.100 --> 34:00.398
the entire time.
What?

34:00.430 --> 34:02.091
I found your boot prints.

34:02.140 --> 34:04.665
Army surplus,
size nine and a half.

34:04.710 --> 34:06.359
It's the same
tread pattern you left

34:06.410 --> 34:08.275
when you stamped
on Alfredo's phone.

34:10.380 --> 34:12.245
You found Olivia yourself.

34:12.280 --> 34:14.214
Then you took Alfredo,

34:14.250 --> 34:16.673
and then you called me
and you asked for my help.

34:16.720 --> 34:18.517
And I'd like to know why.

34:24.560 --> 34:28.451
I didn't tell you
how Olivia got hooked, right?

34:29.900 --> 34:33.495
She dropped out of high school,
ran away to the city.

34:33.530 --> 34:35.134
Just like her big brother.

34:37.300 --> 34:38.801
Yeah, she crashed with me.

34:38.840 --> 34:42.571
Pretty soon, my bad habits
became her bad habits.

34:44.610 --> 34:47.545
She called me right after she
left that Bloom guy's place.

34:49.150 --> 34:51.482
She told me what happened.

34:51.520 --> 34:54.512
That she took all his stuff.

34:54.560 --> 34:56.585
She was all shook up.

34:56.620 --> 34:59.418
But it's funny, you know?

34:59.460 --> 35:03.294
'Cause when I found her,
all I could think about was you.

35:05.470 --> 35:10.294
Your voice in my head...

35:10.340 --> 35:13.639
saying all that stuff
you always say about me.

35:15.540 --> 35:19.442
That I'm despicable, I'm dumb.

35:19.480 --> 35:21.846
That I'm a piece
of garbage.

35:21.880 --> 35:24.542
Well, and you're right.

35:24.590 --> 35:26.740
Again.

35:26.790 --> 35:30.681
And it made me want to show you
that I'm right about you, too.

35:30.720 --> 35:34.520
I knew, if I made you look
for her, you'd find her.

35:34.560 --> 35:37.791
But first, you'd have to go
through what she went through,

35:37.830 --> 35:40.867
see what she saw,
go down the same dark holes.

35:40.900 --> 35:43.289
And I was gonna be there
to watch,

35:43.340 --> 35:45.331
watch it when it hit you.

35:45.370 --> 35:49.477
When you realize
that this is where you belong.

35:49.510 --> 35:52.707
In a place
like this, Sherlock.

35:52.750 --> 35:54.843
With people like me.

35:54.880 --> 35:59.214
I was gonna be there
to watch you fall.

36:02.720 --> 36:06.224
Why do you keep
fighting it, huh?

36:06.260 --> 36:08.455
Why put yourself through this?

36:08.500 --> 36:12.391
_ _ We both know _
it's just a matter of time,

36:12.430 --> 36:14.967
so why not just

36:15.000 --> 36:17.366
cut to the chase?

36:18.640 --> 36:20.608
You're gonna tell me
where Alfredo is.

36:22.340 --> 36:25.969
Why? Why, 'cause he's
your buddy now, huh?

36:26.010 --> 36:27.648
He's your pal?

36:27.680 --> 36:31.286
No, because he has...

36:31.320 --> 36:33.788
nothing to do with this.

36:33.820 --> 36:36.459
No, he does, Sherlock.

36:37.660 --> 36:39.685
But he doesn't have to.

36:43.660 --> 36:46.265
Oh, you didn't fall last night,

36:46.300 --> 36:48.939
so now I just have
to give you a little push.

37:05.720 --> 37:08.609
Old man who owned the place
passed away a few months ago.

37:08.660 --> 37:10.810
Family didn't want to be in
the headstone business anymore.

37:10.860 --> 37:12.725
I think they're still
looking for a buyer.

37:12.760 --> 37:16.423
Your perp's uncle, Folsom,
worked here for 30 years.

37:16.460 --> 37:18.621
Oscar must have known
about this place.

37:18.670 --> 37:21.594
Seems like a pretty good place
to hide a hostage to me.

37:21.640 --> 37:23.733
Let's go though the property,
top to bottom.

37:23.770 --> 37:25.567
(indistinct radio transmission)

37:25.610 --> 37:28.579
OSCAR:
Oh, I know what
you're thinking.

37:28.610 --> 37:30.373
But don't worry.

37:30.410 --> 37:31.900
It's good stuff.

37:31.950 --> 37:34.669
It's from the stash
Olivia took off Bloom.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.574
Same stuff that killed her.

37:36.620 --> 37:38.383
Well, obviously,
I don't want you

37:38.420 --> 37:40.615
to take as much as she did.

37:40.650 --> 37:42.754
The whole point of this
is that you remember.

37:42.790 --> 37:45.759
How you got here,
who brought you.

37:46.790 --> 37:48.758
Oh, there's
that look again.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.620
The one that says,
"What bones should I break,

37:50.660 --> 37:51.695
and in what order?"

37:51.730 --> 37:53.698
Well, you can try it,

37:53.730 --> 37:56.494
but as soon as you touch me,
I'm done talking.

37:56.540 --> 37:58.667
I'll never tell you
how to find Alfredo.

37:58.710 --> 38:00.962
And he'll die, just
like Olivia died.

38:01.010 --> 38:03.899
It'll be your fault
this time, not mine.

38:20.730 --> 38:23.290
MAN:
Back here! I think
I hear someone!

38:27.870 --> 38:30.293
Pop the lock.

38:40.910 --> 38:43.049
Alfredo.

38:43.080 --> 38:44.638
It's like an oven in here.

38:44.690 --> 38:46.339
Somebody get a bus!

38:46.390 --> 38:48.017
He's probably dehydrated.

38:48.050 --> 38:49.984
We need a bus forthwith
to South Shore Memorials.

38:50.020 --> 38:51.885
1,000 block
of Route 109.

38:51.930 --> 38:53.454
African-American male,

38:53.490 --> 38:55.594
mid-305, suffering
from severe dehydration.

38:55.630 --> 38:57.598
Alfredo, you're gonna
be okay, all right?

38:57.630 --> 38:59.063
I'm gonna get him
some water.

38:59.100 --> 39:00.727
I'll let Sherlock know
he's okay.

39:00.770 --> 39:02.658
All right. Gonna get you
out of here, okay?

39:02.700 --> 39:04.099
Stay with me.

39:04.140 --> 39:06.734
(phone buzzing)

39:08.980 --> 39:11.448
What is that? Hey.

39:11.480 --> 39:13.641
I said no phones.

39:13.680 --> 39:16.376
Hey, I said no phones!

39:19.720 --> 39:21.881
(Oscar grunting)

39:30.700 --> 39:32.725
(panﬁng)

39:38.810 --> 39:40.368
(sniffs)

39:50.150 --> 39:52.584
*

40:13.940 --> 40:16.101
(phone ringing)

40:24.820 --> 40:27.038
*

40:38.570 --> 40:41.630
Hey.

40:41.670 --> 40:43.888
Just wanted to see
how you were d0ing.

40:47.970 --> 40:49.779
It's been three days.

40:49.810 --> 40:51.641
I thought you might
be ready to talk.

40:57.780 --> 41:00.544
Something you need to know.

41:00.590 --> 41:02.979
Your father called.

41:04.060 --> 41:06.620
I don't know how,

41:06.660 --> 41:09.151
but he found out
about what happened.

41:09.200 --> 41:11.225
He's getting on a plane.

41:13.230 --> 41:15.869
He's gonna be here tomorrow.
