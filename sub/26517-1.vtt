Previously on
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:03.046 --> 00:05.788
♪ ...wonderful guy.

00:05.831 --> 00:07.703
This has been
the best summer of my life,

00:07.746 --> 00:09.183
and you're
the reason why.

00:09.226 --> 00:11.881
This is a list of all of
the things that I have done.

00:11.924 --> 00:13.491
It's bad.

00:14.231 --> 00:15.711
How did you
get in here?

00:15.754 --> 00:18.496
You sent me poop?
You tried to kill my Lolo?

00:18.540 --> 00:21.021
And you manipulated me
and lied to me.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.808
JOSH: Why are you making me
move? I have no apartment,

00:25.851 --> 00:27.592
no relationship,
no career goals.

00:27.636 --> 00:29.203
I feel like
there's no ground under me.

00:29.246 --> 00:30.769
NATHANIEL: The last few months
have meant a lot to me.

00:30.813 --> 00:33.250
I'll forget about
everything else for you.

00:33.294 --> 00:34.773
They say love makes you crazy.

00:34.817 --> 00:36.340
No!

00:38.255 --> 00:40.475
He was going to kill Nathaniel.

00:40.518 --> 00:42.825
They're gonna charge you with
attempted second-degree murder.

00:42.868 --> 00:43.913
He was trying to hurt you.

00:43.956 --> 00:45.480
I want you to plead
not guilty...

00:45.523 --> 00:46.524
Okay, not guilty.

00:46.568 --> 00:47.699
...by reason of insanity.

00:47.743 --> 00:49.614
You have let me down
so many times,

00:49.658 --> 00:52.313
and you are never going
to be any different.

00:52.356 --> 00:54.010
Wow, I'm sorry, I can't do this.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.621
I want to face the consequences
of what happened on that roof.

00:56.665 --> 00:58.232
So I plead responsible.

00:58.275 --> 01:00.538
I mean... guilty.

01:00.582 --> 01:02.192
I plead guilty.

01:19.818 --> 01:22.952
I'd like to get started.

01:23.953 --> 01:25.085
The State is here.

01:26.477 --> 01:27.783
Where is your counsel,
Miss Bunch?

01:27.826 --> 01:29.741
I'm so sorry. Nathaniel--

01:29.785 --> 01:32.701
Mr.-Mr. Plimpton should
be here any second.

01:32.744 --> 01:34.964
Yeah, I'm not so sure
about that, honey.

01:35.007 --> 01:37.009
He stormed out.
He seemed really upset.

01:38.794 --> 01:40.578
Nathaniel's gone.

01:41.971 --> 01:43.538
I called him,
but he won't answer.

01:43.581 --> 01:46.628
It's okay. It's okay.
I expected that.

01:46.671 --> 01:50.501
I-I'll-I'll call him later and
explain why I did what I did

01:50.545 --> 01:53.983
and that I still love him, and
hopefully he'll listen to me.

01:54.026 --> 01:56.986
So I guess I'll be acting
as Rebecca's counsel.

01:57.029 --> 02:00.163
Um, full disclosure,

02:00.207 --> 02:02.296
I specialize
in real estate law.

02:02.339 --> 02:04.689
Uh, Judge, can we get this
over with? Because the State

02:04.733 --> 02:05.908
would like to
close its case,

02:05.951 --> 02:07.475
and I have to pee.REBECCA: Great.

02:07.518 --> 02:09.912
Mean prosecutor has
to pee, I'm guilty,

02:09.955 --> 02:12.393
so let's just scribble
"guilty" on that pizzle pad

02:12.436 --> 02:14.264
and let's get this
shizzow on the road.

02:14.308 --> 02:15.961
Okay, just wait
just a... sizzecond.

02:16.005 --> 02:18.399
Uh, Your Honor,
may

02:18.442 --> 02:19.791
Are you also her lawyer?

02:19.835 --> 02:22.142
Not yet, uh,
because I don't graduate

02:22.185 --> 02:23.839
for another couple of months,

02:23.882 --> 02:24.840
and then I will,

02:24.883 --> 02:26.450
like Mr. Whitefeather,

02:26.494 --> 02:29.366
specialize in real estate law,
but please, I'm begging you,

02:29.410 --> 02:31.934
please, please
don't accept her plea.

02:31.977 --> 02:33.892
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Don't accept my plea? Paula.

02:33.936 --> 02:36.852
What's wrong with you? I thought
you knew what I was doing here.

02:36.895 --> 02:39.289
I want to finally take
responsibility for my life.

02:39.333 --> 02:40.464
Do you remember
the courtroom?

02:40.508 --> 02:41.770
I gave you a knowing smile,

02:41.813 --> 02:43.032
you gave me a knowing smile.

02:43.075 --> 02:43.989
I thought we were
on the same page,

02:44.033 --> 02:45.382
but now I guess we were, what,

02:45.426 --> 02:46.818
just two idiots
smiling at each other?

02:46.862 --> 02:48.516
Everybody, just calm down.

02:48.559 --> 02:50.822
That's why I brought you
into chambers to tell you

02:50.866 --> 02:53.477
that I can't accept
Miss Bunch's guilty plea.

02:53.521 --> 02:56.001
For starters, it wasn't
even really a plea.

02:56.045 --> 02:58.961
It was more of a speech filled
with, uh, irrelevant details

02:59.004 --> 03:00.484
that you delivered to this lady

03:00.528 --> 03:03.748
with your back to me,
and then I find out that

03:03.792 --> 03:05.228
you're in
a romantic relationship

03:05.272 --> 03:09.885
with your actual lawyer,
who I'm guessing is also in...

03:09.928 --> 03:10.929
ALL:
Real estate.

03:12.104 --> 03:13.149
Right.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.803
So, but great. Right?

03:14.846 --> 03:16.239
Y-You're not gonna accept
Rebecca's plea,

03:16.283 --> 03:17.849
which means you-you
can release her.

03:17.893 --> 03:19.982
No. Your Honor,
respectfully,

03:20.025 --> 03:22.202
give me one second
with my real estate lawyers.

03:22.245 --> 03:23.899
Listen. Hey.

03:23.942 --> 03:25.553
Listen. What are you guys doing?

03:25.596 --> 03:26.945
I really want
to plead guilty, okay?

03:26.989 --> 03:28.512
I want to go to jail.
No.

03:28.556 --> 03:30.862
This game is over.
You made your statement,

03:30.906 --> 03:33.038
and I dug it--
I mean, hence the smiling--

03:33.082 --> 03:35.563
but you are not
gonna go to jail

03:35.606 --> 03:38.261
for trying to defend someone
from being murdered.

03:38.305 --> 03:40.524
Yes, I am. Your Honor, please.

03:40.568 --> 03:42.352
I need to do penance.

03:43.875 --> 03:47.096
If not only for this crime,
then all of my past crimes,

03:47.139 --> 03:48.576
both real and metaphorical.

03:48.619 --> 03:51.361
I need... I want to go to jail.

03:51.405 --> 03:53.102
Oh, well, I'm happy
to hear that,

03:53.145 --> 03:55.017
'cause that's exactly
where you're going.

03:55.060 --> 03:56.453
I'm sending you
to county jail

03:56.497 --> 03:58.629
for six weeks.

03:58.673 --> 04:01.241
Now, let's see how
you like it in there,

04:01.284 --> 04:03.286
and then you can come back
and have another hearing

04:03.330 --> 04:05.070
and decide how
you want to plead.

04:05.114 --> 04:07.072
We are done here.

04:07.116 --> 04:09.249
Okay, okay, great.

04:09.292 --> 04:11.903
I can work with this.
This isn't so bad.

04:11.947 --> 04:13.905
It's six weeks.
That gives me plenty of time

04:13.949 --> 04:15.124
to get the charges dropped.Nope, nope.

04:15.167 --> 04:16.473
I don't care how many
hearings we have.

04:16.517 --> 04:17.996
I'm gonna plead guilty
at every one of them.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.259
And the next hearing
after that.

04:19.302 --> 04:22.087
Guilty. And I forget
what happens after that

04:22.131 --> 04:23.872
because I also specialize
in real estate law,

04:23.915 --> 04:26.875
but this I do know:

04:26.918 --> 04:28.877
Jail is what I deserve.

04:32.054 --> 04:34.099
I deserve this.

04:37.364 --> 04:39.322
I deserve this.

04:40.628 --> 04:42.325
I deserve this.

04:45.633 --> 04:47.330
GUARD:
Next. Contraband check.

04:47.374 --> 04:51.073
Lift up your breasts,
squat and cough.

04:51.116 --> 04:54.119
I deserve this.

05:02.040 --> 05:05.000
This one's not bad.

05:06.218 --> 05:07.916
Why do you need these again?

05:07.959 --> 05:09.918
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I enjoyed purchasing them.

05:09.961 --> 05:11.485
Nothing like walking up
to a cash register

05:11.528 --> 05:13.138
with just an armful of murder.

05:13.182 --> 05:15.053
Bet I'm not on
any watch lists now.

05:15.097 --> 05:17.447
I told you, I need a machete
for my excursion.

05:17.491 --> 05:19.971
Does everyone take a machete
on a camping trip?

05:20.015 --> 05:22.365
It's not a pansy-ass
camping trip.

05:22.409 --> 05:26.064
It's an intense outdoor
survivalist excursion.

05:26.108 --> 05:28.153
That's why it's called
Death Wish Adventures.

05:28.197 --> 05:30.286
Love that name.
Sounds therapeutic.

05:30.330 --> 05:31.766
Oh, it is, it is.

05:31.809 --> 05:34.769
And for the low, low price
of $100,000,

05:34.812 --> 05:35.944
I pay this company

05:35.987 --> 05:37.162
to beat me up,

05:37.206 --> 05:38.903
drive me out
to the middle of the woods,

05:38.947 --> 05:40.427
and leave me alone
to fend for myself.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.211
I can't wait!

05:42.254 --> 05:44.126
Okay, look.

05:44.169 --> 05:46.258
I know that you're going through
a rough time, you know,

05:46.302 --> 05:48.478
with the woman you love
publicly rejecting you

05:48.522 --> 05:49.958
in favor of incarceration,

05:50.001 --> 05:51.307
but, Nathaniel,

05:51.351 --> 05:53.657
why don't you just
go and talk to her?

05:53.701 --> 05:55.006
Stop. Okay?

05:55.050 --> 05:56.617
She chose what she chose.
I'm done.

05:56.660 --> 05:59.271
I don't want to talk to her,
I don't want to talk about her.

05:59.315 --> 06:00.316
Look at this place.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.013
I'm eating pizza
and Chinese food.

06:02.057 --> 06:04.538
Obviously,
I need a complete reset.

06:04.581 --> 06:06.148
Okay, yes, but there's
got to be a better way

06:06.191 --> 06:07.410
to reset than killing yourself.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.369
I'm not killing myself,
George, okay?

06:09.412 --> 06:12.110
I'm going on a
death wish adventure!

06:15.810 --> 06:17.986
Go buy me another bag.

06:18.029 --> 06:19.335
Machete-proof.

06:19.379 --> 06:21.990
Well, I can't go
to the same store.

06:26.908 --> 06:30.172
I just can't believe
Rebecca's in jail for murder.

06:30.215 --> 06:31.652
I don't think it's murder.

06:31.695 --> 06:33.523
It's pretty clear she was
just defending Nathaniel.

06:33.567 --> 06:35.830
Maybe. I don't know.

06:35.873 --> 06:37.440
I don't know what to
think about her anymore.

06:37.484 --> 06:40.791
I used to think Rebecca
was so innocent and sweet.

06:40.835 --> 06:42.053
Well, we all did, right?

06:42.097 --> 06:43.446
Not really.

06:43.490 --> 06:45.361
Look, I like her
and she's my friend,

06:45.405 --> 06:47.058
but she's done
some crazy things,

06:47.102 --> 06:48.625
pretty much from day one.

06:48.669 --> 06:53.500
So how did I still miss it?
How did I miss it, Hector?

06:53.543 --> 06:54.805
Look, you loved her

06:54.849 --> 06:56.633
and you missed certain things
because of that.

06:56.677 --> 06:58.200
And she has
mental health issues.

06:58.243 --> 06:59.201
She has a disorder.

06:59.244 --> 07:01.290
Disorder.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.466
Yeah, maybe I also have
a disorder.

07:03.510 --> 07:04.641
What, dude?

07:04.685 --> 07:05.729
Yeah, think about it.

07:05.773 --> 07:07.514
Okay, those things
about Rebecca,

07:07.557 --> 07:11.431
they're not the only things
I've missed, like, in life.

07:11.474 --> 07:13.128
I-I didn't realize

07:13.171 --> 07:15.130
being a priest
would be such a bummer.

07:15.173 --> 07:17.088
I didn't realize
I was dancing at a gay bar

07:17.132 --> 07:18.742
for, like, a month.
I didn't realize

07:18.786 --> 07:20.701
your mom doesn't like it
when I whistle in the shower.

07:20.744 --> 07:23.094
Now that you bring it up,
it's weird you live with my mom.

07:23.138 --> 07:24.444
You lived with your mom.

07:24.487 --> 07:25.619
She's my mom.

07:25.662 --> 07:27.272
Oh.

07:27.316 --> 07:29.274
I see what you're saying.
Okay, I get it. Yeah.

07:29.318 --> 07:31.538
So...  that's weird.

07:31.581 --> 07:33.235
See? I have a disorder.

07:33.278 --> 07:35.324
Maybe.

07:35.367 --> 07:37.326
Or maybe you're a little
oblivious, self-absorbed,

07:37.369 --> 07:39.894
and need to be more aware
of the world around you.

07:39.937 --> 07:41.243
No. Disorder.

07:41.286 --> 07:44.507
Or...Disorder. I have one.

07:44.551 --> 07:45.856
I wonder which one.

07:48.380 --> 07:50.905
REBECCA: I deserve this. I deserve this.

07:50.948 --> 07:54.125
I deserve this. I deserve this.
I deserve this.

07:54.169 --> 07:55.518
I deserve this. I...

07:55.562 --> 07:57.868
NICKY: Will you
shut the hell up?

07:57.912 --> 08:00.175
You've been chanting that
for days.

08:00.218 --> 08:03.004
I'm in here for assault,
and I'm trying to be good,

08:03.047 --> 08:04.353
but God help me,

08:04.396 --> 08:06.529
what you really deserve
is a throat punch.

08:06.573 --> 08:09.184
I'm sorry.

08:09.227 --> 08:13.275
I'm just, I'm...
I'm sad and scared.

08:13.318 --> 08:15.364
I came here
to do penance,

08:15.407 --> 08:17.366
but I don't know
what that looks like,

08:17.409 --> 08:20.978
and I think I just gave up
the man I love,

08:21.022 --> 08:24.373
and, God, this place
is terrible.

08:24.416 --> 08:26.114
It's terrible in jail?

08:26.157 --> 08:28.943
Wow, really insightful analysis

08:28.986 --> 08:31.162
of the criminal justice system,
Harvard.

08:31.206 --> 08:33.251
How do you know
I went to Harvard?

08:33.295 --> 08:34.905
Well, other than,
"I deserve this,"

08:34.949 --> 08:36.951
that's the only thing
you've said since you got here.

08:36.994 --> 08:39.954
Oh, sounds like
I worked it in organically.

08:39.997 --> 08:41.651
What?

08:41.695 --> 08:43.653
Well, sometimes it sounds
like you're bragging.

08:43.697 --> 08:45.742
Like, when people ask
where you went to college,

08:45.786 --> 08:47.570
and you say,
"I went to school in Boston,"

08:47.614 --> 08:49.790
and they say, "Where in Boston?"
and you say, "Cambridge,"

08:49.833 --> 08:51.922
and they say, "Do you mean
Harvard?" and you say, "Yeah,"

08:51.966 --> 08:53.837
and they say, "Well, why didn't
you just say Harvard?"

08:53.881 --> 08:56.231
and you say, "I didn't want
to sound like I was bragging,"

08:56.274 --> 08:58.233
and, oh, my God, I'm in jail!

09:04.456 --> 09:06.458
You can comfort me.

09:06.502 --> 09:08.069
Yeah, I'm good.

09:10.462 --> 09:12.203
Oh, thank God,
activities time. Yes!

09:12.247 --> 09:13.465
Activities?

09:13.509 --> 09:15.250
What do they have?
Anything good?

09:15.293 --> 09:17.252
Eh, there's a nonprofit group
that comes in

09:17.295 --> 09:18.601
and does theater with us.

09:18.645 --> 09:19.776
I'm sorry...

09:19.820 --> 09:22.387
does what?

09:22.431 --> 09:24.607
INMATES:
Zip. Zap. Zop.

09:24.651 --> 09:26.740
Zip.

Zop.

09:26.783 --> 09:28.393

09:30.004 --> 09:31.222

09:31.266 --> 09:33.181
Okay, let's pick up
the pace, ladies.

09:33.224 --> 09:34.443
Don't think,
just react.

09:34.486 --> 09:36.271
Zip.

09:36.314 --> 09:37.359

09:40.449 --> 09:41.842
Oh, no, no. Oh, I messed up.

09:41.885 --> 09:43.191
It was supposed to be z-zap.That's okay, Rebecca.

09:43.234 --> 09:44.714
Why don't you start us
off on the next round?

09:44.758 --> 09:46.542
Okay. I have a question.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.936
Um, do you only do
theater games in here?

09:48.979 --> 09:52.330
No, sometimes we do scenes
from plays or films or TV shows.

09:52.374 --> 09:53.723
Really?
Mm-hmm.

09:53.767 --> 09:57.031
Okay, um, I actually have
an amazing idea,

09:57.074 --> 09:59.033
and I think it's something
that could take

09:59.076 --> 10:02.863
this theater nonprofit outreach
organization to the next level.

10:04.473 --> 10:08.216
♪ I'm as corny

10:08.259 --> 10:11.436

10:38.550 --> 10:42.554
Okay, so, I am investigating
everything to do with Trent.

10:42.598 --> 10:44.513
Mm-hmm.We have to prove that
Trent was stalking you,

10:44.556 --> 10:46.558
but then we can show
that your actions

10:46.602 --> 10:47.951
were in the defense
of others.

10:49.518 --> 10:51.563
Uh-huh. Yeah, cool.
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

10:53.740 --> 10:57.439
Okay, look, I-I-I know you've
committed to this whole

10:57.482 --> 11:00.572
penance thing here, but this
is gonna get old real fast,

11:00.616 --> 11:03.575
and when it does, you're gonna
be grateful that I am here

11:03.619 --> 11:05.055
trying to spring you.

11:05.099 --> 11:07.667
Okay, Paula, I'm sorry,
I know it's frustrating,

11:07.710 --> 11:09.538
but I've told you before,
you're wasting your time.

11:09.581 --> 11:13.934
I'm sorry, I want to be here.
It was the right decision.

11:13.977 --> 11:17.589
And now, I just figured out
what my penance will be.

11:17.633 --> 11:19.591
Making a contribution
to my theater class.

11:19.635 --> 11:21.506
Okay, so I suggested
we do South Pacific,

11:21.550 --> 11:22.769
which everyone loved.

11:22.812 --> 11:24.161
Uh, sure.And the thing

11:24.205 --> 11:25.597
I'm marinating on is:
what do we do next?

11:25.641 --> 11:26.816
And I'm thinking Pippin.

11:26.860 --> 11:27.991
Scottie Pippen
from the Bulls?

11:28.035 --> 11:29.689
I can't...Oh, my God.

11:29.732 --> 11:31.386
Wow, how are we friends?
No, Pippin.It's a musical.

11:31.429 --> 11:33.649
Uh-huh.
So...

11:33.693 --> 11:35.607
Okay, it's a musical.
Look, honey, I'm-I'm

11:35.651 --> 11:37.914
glad that you
found a pastime...A penance.

11:37.958 --> 11:40.743
Okay, I am going to
get you out of here.

11:40.787 --> 11:42.919
And the good
news is, is that

11:42.963 --> 11:45.008
I'll probably be able to
do it before you do Cats.

11:45.052 --> 11:48.620
:
Oh, I would never do Cats.

11:48.664 --> 11:52.189
Come on.
I'm not that much of a dork.

11:55.976 --> 11:59.457
MAN:
Enjoy your campsite!

12:01.851 --> 12:03.070
Great beating, guys, thank you!

12:03.113 --> 12:05.594
MAN:
Suck it, maggot!

12:05.637 --> 12:09.032
Yeah. Oh. Ooh.

12:09.076 --> 12:10.294
Okay.

12:13.645 --> 12:15.691
:
Yes.

12:20.043 --> 12:23.090
: Ah, that's why
they said "maggot."

12:23.133 --> 12:26.180
Okay, that's funny. Funny.

12:34.841 --> 12:37.669
That's gonna miss the spot.

12:37.713 --> 12:39.541
These guys are good.
They're good.

12:39.584 --> 12:42.674
MAN: All right, let's go!
Big stick here, big stick!

12:53.642 --> 12:56.079
No. No.

12:56.123 --> 12:57.689
Oh, a quiz. Ha.

12:57.733 --> 12:59.866
All right, Quimblepop.com,

12:59.909 --> 13:02.129
thank you
for that quiche recipe.

13:02.172 --> 13:04.784
Now tell me
what disorder I have.

13:06.611 --> 13:09.092
REBECCA: Okay, so there's
Pippin, there'sGodspell.

13:09.136 --> 13:10.790
An unknown gem
is Triumph of Love.

13:10.833 --> 13:13.488
It's not perfect.
It's not perfect, Cybil.

13:13.531 --> 13:15.795
Okay, Jasmine, may I have
the talking balloon?

13:15.838 --> 13:17.318
Rebecca?Yeah. Oh, my God.

13:17.361 --> 13:18.754
Of course. I would love
to hear your thoughts.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.277
Okay.

13:20.321 --> 13:22.366
: Nicky, you have
the balloon on the wrong face.

13:22.410 --> 13:24.716
: No, it's on
the right face. The sad face.

13:26.370 --> 13:28.198
I did not like the dumb
South Pacificsong.

13:28.242 --> 13:29.765
None of us liked it.

13:29.809 --> 13:31.549
Oh, I thought you guys did.

13:31.593 --> 13:32.724
No.

13:32.768 --> 13:34.596
Oh, I'm-- God, I'm so sorry.

13:34.639 --> 13:35.858
It's dumb
and it's old-fashioned.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.947
Right, right, of course, I see.

13:37.991 --> 13:40.167
We all appreciate
your enthusiasm.

13:40.210 --> 13:41.037
I don't.

13:41.081 --> 13:44.040
Yeah, um, no, you're right.

13:44.084 --> 13:45.607
Guys, I am so sorry.

13:45.650 --> 13:46.738
I mean, look,

13:46.782 --> 13:48.131
the song's relevant to me.

13:48.175 --> 13:50.568
It symbolizes a time in my life
when I was, like,

13:50.612 --> 13:52.266
truly happy and I maybe thought,
cosmically,

13:52.309 --> 13:54.616
that's why I'm in jail-- to,
like, reenact that song somehow,

13:54.659 --> 13:56.748
but that's...
that's not relevant

13:56.792 --> 13:58.838
to what's actually
happening, right?

13:58.881 --> 14:00.361
I mean, I've never been
to Polynesia. Have you?

14:00.404 --> 14:01.623
Who's been to Polynesia?

14:01.666 --> 14:03.016
I have.
Okay.

14:03.059 --> 14:04.844
So what we
need to do...

14:04.887 --> 14:08.064
Maybe we need to do something
more relevant.

14:08.108 --> 14:09.892
Right? Yeah.

14:09.936 --> 14:12.112
Something that's more relevant
to the here and now,

14:12.155 --> 14:13.896
to all your lives,
to our lives.

14:13.940 --> 14:15.985
I like the class the way it was.

14:16.029 --> 14:17.639
Me, too.
Let's play Zip Zap Zop.

14:17.682 --> 14:19.641
Zip zap stop, hear me out.

14:19.684 --> 14:22.339
What we do is an original piece.

14:22.383 --> 14:23.863
Yes.

14:23.906 --> 14:25.255
Put up an original piece.

14:25.299 --> 14:27.779
Uh, yes! Oh, man, this is
what I can contribute.

14:27.823 --> 14:29.129
This is my penance.

14:29.172 --> 14:31.261
Okay, we put
that piece up.

14:31.305 --> 14:34.612
I mean, I'm sure that all of you
have the most amazing stories

14:34.656 --> 14:37.659

romance and-and meaning.

14:37.702 --> 14:39.791

14:39.835 --> 14:41.619
Okay, and we put those stories
on their feet,

14:41.663 --> 14:43.230
and then NPR comes to the jail,

14:43.273 --> 14:45.145

17:47.762 --> 17:50.852
I was a no-good,
manipulative love addict

17:50.895 --> 17:53.637
with undiagnosed
borderline personality disorder.

17:53.681 --> 17:57.206

He tried to kill
the man I loved,

18:07.086 --> 18:09.088
so I pushed him off a building!

18:09.131 --> 18:11.960
And then, when I pled guilty

18:12.003 --> 18:13.744
just for, like,
metaphorical symbolism,

18:13.788 --> 18:17.096
the judge knew I was innocent
so she didn't accept my plea,

18:17.139 --> 18:19.750

19:09.583 --> 19:12.934
I have ADHD,
OCD and synesthesia.

19:14.544 --> 19:16.416
Oh. When I think about
the number five,

19:16.459 --> 19:19.419
I see the color blue
and I smell daisies.

19:19.462 --> 19:20.898
Daisies have no scent.

19:20.942 --> 19:24.075
They do if you have synesthesia.

19:24.119 --> 19:25.947
Yeah, Josh, you don't have
any of those things.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.862
You really don't.Yes, I do.

19:27.905 --> 19:31.692
Okay, for example,
my OCD is why I list things.

19:31.735 --> 19:33.520
Watch. Here are the beers
you have here:

19:33.563 --> 19:36.871
pilsner, pale ale, lager,
hard cider, IPA, porter,

19:36.914 --> 19:38.873
stout and Hefeweizen.
Explain that.

19:38.916 --> 19:42.137
Mm. Yeah, you worked here.
That's why you know those.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.748
I thought listing was an
autism spectrum thing.

19:44.792 --> 19:47.142
Exactly. I have that, too.
Look right here.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.970
Uh-huh. Josh, where did you
get these quizzes again?

19:49.013 --> 19:50.406
Quimblepop.

19:50.450 --> 19:52.234
Quimblepop?
Also,

19:52.278 --> 19:54.062
they're doing
original programming now.

19:54.105 --> 19:57.326
Have you seen Terrier Chef?
Aw...

19:57.370 --> 20:00.155
Josh, online quizzes are just
clickbait; they're not real.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.591
I once took a quiz,

20:01.635 --> 20:03.332
it told me I was Miranda
from Sex and the City.

20:03.376 --> 20:06.117
When you're clearly a Charlotte.

20:06.161 --> 20:07.945
Oh, I thought I was Carrie.

20:07.989 --> 20:11.166
No, no, baby, no. I'm Carrie.

20:11.210 --> 20:14.517
Look, Josh, I really respect
your search for self,

20:14.561 --> 20:16.432
but these are actual disorders
people suffer from,

20:16.476 --> 20:18.129
and you're treating it
like you're just,

20:18.173 --> 20:20.567
like, identity shopping.Yeah, it's kind of gross.

20:20.610 --> 20:21.872
HEATHER: What, Rebecca
wants to be in jail,

20:21.916 --> 20:24.135
you want to have a disorder?

20:24.179 --> 20:26.137
This is, like,
a really messed up episode

20:26.181 --> 20:27.748
of Sex and the City.

20:27.791 --> 20:30.272
Wow, you guys don't want
to accept who I am.

20:30.316 --> 20:33.841
That is cruel and unfair,
but it's your issue, not mine.

20:33.884 --> 20:35.059
This is the kind
of prejudices

20:35.103 --> 20:37.192
we've been dealing with
for centuries.

20:37.236 --> 20:40.108
Who is "we"? You just named
eight communities.

20:40.151 --> 20:42.415
Yeah, Josh, if you think you
actually, like, have something,

20:42.458 --> 20:45.113
you should get some help,
like, professional help.

20:45.156 --> 20:46.941
I'm just a regional manager.

20:46.984 --> 20:48.899
I don't need that.
The quizzes point you

20:48.943 --> 20:51.946
to some really helpful articles,
which are free.

20:51.989 --> 20:53.643
No, I think you guys should get
on Quimblepop and figure out

20:53.687 --> 20:56.820
what disorder you have that
makes you such crappy friends.

21:01.347 --> 21:05.220
Hey, buddy. It's okay.

21:05.264 --> 21:09.224
I'm your friend.

21:12.183 --> 21:14.055
That's okay.

21:14.098 --> 21:16.231
It's protein.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.015
You need protein.

21:18.059 --> 21:20.104
Now time for some dew.

21:22.411 --> 21:24.413
Okay.

21:45.042 --> 21:47.349
Who's there?

21:47.393 --> 21:49.873
Hey, pal.

21:49.917 --> 21:51.788
Damn it.

21:51.832 --> 21:53.268
How did you find me?

21:53.312 --> 21:55.401
The company said that
my location was confidential.

21:55.444 --> 21:57.228
Yeah, I threatened them legally,
and it turns out

21:57.272 --> 21:58.708
they cannot afford
another lawsuit.

21:58.752 --> 22:01.363
Did you know
some people have died

22:01.407 --> 22:02.930
while using
Death Wish Adventures?

22:05.193 --> 22:06.716
What are you even doing here?

22:06.760 --> 22:08.979
Okay, so, long story,

22:09.023 --> 22:12.243
my old camp counselor is the
real-life guy from 127 Hours.

22:12.287 --> 22:13.549
I wasn't there for him that day

22:13.593 --> 22:14.855
on that slot canyon,

22:14.898 --> 22:16.117
and now he has no arm.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.293
So I'm not leaving your side.

22:18.337 --> 22:20.295
But don't worry about me,

22:20.339 --> 22:22.776
I'll just be roughing it
alongside you.

22:22.819 --> 22:25.082
And let me know if you want
some juicy bratwurst,

22:25.126 --> 22:27.998
'cause I brought a whole bunch
of tasty meats.

22:36.311 --> 22:38.313
♪

22:40.533 --> 22:45.755
Could you...
turn off... the ska?

22:45.799 --> 22:48.323
♪ Now let me tell you
something that... ♪

22:52.153 --> 22:53.981
Can I ask you a question?

22:54.024 --> 22:55.417
Nope.Cool. I'm gonna
keep going, then.

22:55.461 --> 22:57.680
Is this whole thing
helping you

22:57.724 --> 22:59.160
in some way?

22:59.203 --> 23:00.770
Is this helping you
get over Rebecca?

23:00.814 --> 23:02.119
I'm not gonna talk, so...

23:02.163 --> 23:04.121
Great, well, you know what?
I'll talk.

23:04.165 --> 23:06.341
All right?
'Cause I'm not going away.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.169
Just like the ska band
Less Than Jake didn't go away

23:08.212 --> 23:09.953
after their major
label release flopped.

23:09.997 --> 23:11.564
And don't think The Hippos

23:11.607 --> 23:13.130
didn't take
notice of that.

23:13.174 --> 23:14.305
That's another ska band.
So are the Impossibles.

23:14.349 --> 23:15.785
There's a lot of s...

23:15.829 --> 23:17.352
Okay, shut up, I'll talk.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.180
Just stop talking about ska.

23:21.617 --> 23:24.620
No. I don't feel better. Yet.

23:24.664 --> 23:26.187
But I will.

23:26.230 --> 23:27.449
I was pushing myself
to the extreme.

23:27.493 --> 23:28.972
It's how I work
through setbacks.

23:29.016 --> 23:30.278
Gets me out of my head.

23:31.758 --> 23:34.630
When I got a 1400 on the PSAT,
I climbed Mount Whitney.

23:34.674 --> 23:37.459
Went Stanford water polo
placed third at Nationals,

23:37.503 --> 23:39.243
I ran the Death Valley Marathon.

23:39.287 --> 23:40.897
And when my
best friend Trip

23:40.941 --> 23:44.379
joined a cult, I just straight
up jumped into a frozen lake.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.163
Almost lost a toe.

23:46.207 --> 23:48.383
Wow. Hot take:

23:48.427 --> 23:52.387
is it possible that this pain
is not therapeutic?

23:52.431 --> 23:54.607
It's just more
emotional cutting?

23:54.650 --> 23:57.174
No. No, you're wrong, okay?

23:57.218 --> 23:59.002
That's not it at all, all right?

23:59.046 --> 24:00.526
Now, I'm done talking to you.

24:00.569 --> 24:02.963
You want to be here?
I can't make you go away.

24:03.006 --> 24:05.792
But leave me alone, all right?

24:05.835 --> 24:09.317
Fine. Then I'll just have
my flank steak and bratwurst

24:09.360 --> 24:12.146
all by myself.

24:15.279 --> 24:16.803
Sh...

24:19.066 --> 24:21.285
It's so good to see you.
What are you eating?

24:21.329 --> 24:24.288
You look so tight.
Ugh, I wish I was in jail.

24:24.332 --> 24:26.595
Yeah, no. Sorry.

24:26.639 --> 24:28.292
Okay, Rebecca?

24:28.336 --> 24:30.077
We have something to tell you.You know what?

24:30.120 --> 24:33.428
I have something to tell you.
I figured out something huge.

24:33.472 --> 24:34.821
I am privileged.

24:34.864 --> 24:38.564
That just occurred to you
just right now?Right.

24:38.607 --> 24:40.261
It-- I know.
It's a shock to me, too.

24:40.304 --> 24:43.003
But I am privileged.
And I'm myopic.

24:43.046 --> 24:45.745
Okay, Rebecca, stop.
Listen, no, I have some news.

24:45.788 --> 24:47.442
Oh, my God, please don't spoil
Terrier Cheffor me.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.052
It's the only thing I have left.
Please. No.

24:49.096 --> 24:50.445
Oh, I haven't seen it, either.
La, la, la, la...

24:50.489 --> 24:52.055
No. What? Girl, stop.

24:52.099 --> 24:53.361
You have a new hearing.

24:53.404 --> 24:54.884
What

24:54.928 --> 24:56.407
It's a miracle.
Trent woke up from his coma

24:56.451 --> 24:57.626
and confessed to everything.

24:57.670 --> 24:59.628
To stalking you,
to trying to kill Nathaniel.

24:59.672 --> 25:01.369
Yeah. The state has
no case anymore.

25:01.412 --> 25:03.502
Yep, you got a new
hearing tomorrow.

25:03.545 --> 25:06.635
All the charges are gonna be
dismissed, and you will be out.

25:06.679 --> 25:09.203
I just got you
out of jail.

25:09.246 --> 25:10.509
You're gonna be free!

25:12.336 --> 25:14.991
It's great news, right?

25:15.035 --> 25:18.038
PAULA:
Oh, you do not

25:18.081 --> 25:20.431
still want to stay here?

25:20.475 --> 25:22.303
Of course I do.

25:28.614 --> 25:30.659
What did you expect?
I came here to pay penance,

25:30.703 --> 25:32.400
and I have not done that yet.

25:32.443 --> 25:34.271
I did the opposite
of that.

25:34.315 --> 25:37.274
I was selfish and I tried
to force my own narrative

25:37.318 --> 25:40.364
on these women, and steal their
stories for my own purposes.

25:40.408 --> 25:43.585
And for what
For a Lin

25:43.629 --> 25:45.065
Oh, he is so inspirational.

25:45.108 --> 25:46.762
Did you know he grew that
ponytail just for that show?

25:46.806 --> 25:48.024
HEATHER:
What? Okay, Rebecca,

25:48.068 --> 25:49.852
I hate to break it to you,

25:49.896 --> 25:52.028
but you know, whatever
you do in here, nothing

25:52.072 --> 25:55.075
is gonna change the fact that
you're a rich white lawyer lady

25:55.118 --> 25:57.251
who pled guilty
for dramatic effect.

25:57.294 --> 25:58.861
It's kind of gross.

25:58.905 --> 26:01.255
Exactly. Yeah, it's gross.

26:01.298 --> 26:02.648
So now you expect me

26:02.691 --> 26:04.258
just to waltz out of here,

26:04.301 --> 26:05.738
and not even serve
my mandatory six weeks?

26:05.781 --> 26:07.435
My theater friends
can't do that.

26:07.478 --> 26:09.698
Uh-uh-uh, honey, you staying
here doesn't help anyone

26:09.742 --> 26:11.700
who's been wronged,
just like your guilty plea

26:11.744 --> 26:13.746
didn't help anyone
you'd wronged.

26:13.789 --> 26:15.530
HEATHER: Yeah, and none
of that matters anyways,

26:15.574 --> 26:17.750
because Paula got
the charges dropped...Yes.

26:17.793 --> 26:20.361
...so you're getting out of here
whether you like it or not.

26:20.404 --> 26:22.668
Well, I don't like it.
I'm sorry.

26:22.711 --> 26:24.365
PAULA:
Honey,

26:24.408 --> 26:28.369
people just don't want
to stay in jail.

26:28.412 --> 26:30.327
I don't understand.

26:30.371 --> 26:32.634
I know you don't, Paula.

26:35.419 --> 26:37.291

All right.

No.

31:56.349 --> 31:59.439
Well, now, did the torture
make you feel better?

31:59.482 --> 32:01.006
No, that's why I gave up
on the torture. I don't,

32:01.049 --> 32:02.703
I don't know. I don't
know what it is, George.

32:02.746 --> 32:04.792
Maybe I'm just broken.

32:04.835 --> 32:08.013
That is such a sad thing to say.

32:08.056 --> 32:11.146
Part one. Part two, really good

What-- no. Don't-don't tell me
what it is, all right?

32:30.426 --> 32:33.516
No news from the real world.
I'm still on a retreat.

Rebecca just got out of jail.

32:34.778 --> 32:37.738
What? Let me see that.

32:37.781 --> 32:40.480
You see? That news
made you feel better.

32:44.788 --> 32:46.747
You're right.

Of course it did.

So that's about it.

33:06.071 --> 33:08.464
That's my life story.

33:08.508 --> 33:11.032
It really is.
You started at conception.

33:11.076 --> 33:13.165
Interesting you know that story.

33:13.208 --> 33:16.081
So, um, like, how do we treat
all these things I have?

33:16.124 --> 33:18.648
Like, which do we do first,
Dr. Man Akopian?

33:18.692 --> 33:21.390
Should we do OCD first? Because
I might get OCD about my OCD.

33:21.434 --> 33:23.610
Josh, I don't know
how to tell you this.

33:23.653 --> 33:25.090
Actually, I do.

33:25.133 --> 33:27.701
You don't have
any of those disorders.

33:27.744 --> 33:29.311
I really wish people
would stop taking

33:29.355 --> 33:30.573
those online quizzes.

33:30.617 --> 33:31.879
They're very inaccurate.

33:31.922 --> 33:33.794
I mean,
on Sex and the Cityquizzes,

33:33.837 --> 33:36.666
I always get Steve,
but I'm clearly an Aidan.

33:38.886 --> 33:41.802
But... so if-if I don't
have a disorder,

33:41.845 --> 33:43.064
what can I do?

33:43.108 --> 33:44.848
Because something
is clearly wrong.

33:44.892 --> 33:46.198
You can do exactly

33:46.241 --> 33:48.417
what you're doing
sitting here with me.

33:48.461 --> 33:49.723
Look within.

33:49.766 --> 33:51.377
Josh, it's not about

33:51.420 --> 33:53.814
checking a box and getting
a fancy label, or 12,

33:53.857 --> 33:55.685
for what's bothering you.

33:55.729 --> 33:58.253
Instead, you can think
about the choices you make

33:58.297 --> 33:59.820
and why you make them.

33:59.863 --> 34:01.865
That sounds hard.

34:01.909 --> 34:03.824
Yeah, yeah. But don't worry.

34:03.867 --> 34:06.740
It will take a long time.

34:09.525 --> 34:11.788
Okay.

34:21.189 --> 34:23.844
Nice custom banner, babe.

34:23.887 --> 34:25.759
Yeah, they weirdly
had it at the store.

34:28.849 --> 34:29.893
Wait, whose baby is that?

34:29.937 --> 34:32.374
Are you, are you kidding?

34:33.419 --> 34:34.724
It's my baby.

34:34.768 --> 34:37.205
The one you helped me make?

34:37.249 --> 34:38.554
Oh! Right, right, right, right.

34:38.598 --> 34:40.295

Rebecca, I'm making

34:40.339 --> 34:42.471
my favorite ceviche.Mm. Family recipe?

34:42.515 --> 34:44.038
No, I got it
from Quimblepop.

34:44.082 --> 34:46.084
Also, took the quiz again,

34:46.127 --> 34:48.129
and you're looking
at a Carrie.

34:48.173 --> 34:50.349
You gamed the quiz
to get that, Charlotte.

34:50.392 --> 34:52.264
Hey.

34:52.307 --> 34:53.830
You okay?

34:53.874 --> 34:55.876
Feeling better?

34:55.919 --> 34:57.747
Honey.

34:57.791 --> 35:00.489
Honey, you're home.
You're with your people.

35:01.838 --> 35:03.275
What do you want
to do next

35:03.318 --> 35:05.886
Ice cream

35:05.929 --> 35:07.801
Wow, we really need to find

35:07.844 --> 35:09.803
some non food-related activities
for us, don't we?

35:09.846 --> 35:11.109
Paula, I don't want
to do anything.

35:11.152 --> 35:14.155
Everything I do is wrong,
by definition.

35:15.330 --> 35:17.593
Because of my privilege.

35:17.637 --> 35:19.204
Okay, that's it.
I've had enough.

35:19.247 --> 35:20.466
Rebecca,
if I hear you

35:20.509 --> 35:22.207
say the word "privilege"
one more time...

35:25.949 --> 35:27.647
You have privilege.
I'm glad you acknowledge it.

35:27.690 --> 35:29.344
So now you have a choice.

35:29.388 --> 35:31.564
Do something good for the world
that actually helps people,

35:31.607 --> 35:32.826
or shut up.

35:32.869 --> 35:34.132
But stop whining.

35:35.959 --> 35:37.570
Baller Miranda move.

35:39.224 --> 35:41.139
Thank you.

35:41.182 --> 35:42.705
You're welcome.

35:42.749 --> 35:44.272
You're right. You're right.

35:44.316 --> 35:49.103
I need to do something
practical, to counteract my...

35:49.147 --> 35:50.800
my pri-- my, uh,

35:50.844 --> 35:55.370
systemic socioeconomic
racial and cisgender advantages.

35:56.676 --> 35:58.547
Oh, you mean that?

36:05.859 --> 36:08.078
Hi.

36:08.122 --> 36:09.689
Hi.

36:09.732 --> 36:11.604
Can I talk to you for a second?

36:13.301 --> 36:15.695
Good banner.

36:17.479 --> 36:21.614
Um, look, before
you say anything, I-I...

36:21.657 --> 36:24.530
I want to say I'm sorry.

36:24.573 --> 36:27.315
I stormed out of the courthouse,
and I took your plea personally,

36:27.359 --> 36:29.012
and I shouldn't have.

36:29.056 --> 36:30.579
I'm just...

36:30.623 --> 36:33.234
I'm just so glad
you're out of jail.

36:33.278 --> 36:36.237
Oh, my gosh. Oh, it feels
so good to hear you say that.

36:36.281 --> 36:38.152
You were so mad at me.

36:40.285 --> 36:42.461
Mm. 'Cause you reall--
you have to know

36:42.504 --> 36:44.463
that all the things I said
in that courtroom

36:44.506 --> 36:47.292
truly had nothing to do
with how I feel about you.

36:48.554 --> 36:51.296
I still love you, Nathaniel.

36:51.339 --> 36:53.080
I love you, too.

37:00.000 --> 37:01.741
Oh, I'm so glad all
this drama's behind us.

37:01.784 --> 37:03.438
What happened to your face?

37:03.482 --> 37:06.485
Oh, it was, uh, camping.
Long story.

37:06.528 --> 37:09.139
What?Yeah. I'm just
so glad we can be

37:09.183 --> 37:10.924
free and clear now.

37:10.967 --> 37:13.535
Yeah. Well, I mean,
I still have some work to do.

37:13.579 --> 37:15.363
A lot of work to do, actually.

37:16.582 --> 37:18.148
Going to jail
was totally misguided,

37:18.192 --> 37:20.020
but I meant
what I said in the courtroom.

37:20.063 --> 37:21.282
You know?
About being a better person.

37:21.326 --> 37:23.284
I want to do that, somehow.

37:23.328 --> 37:26.200
Right. You want to make some
donations, serve on some boards.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.941
No, more than that. I want to...

37:27.984 --> 37:30.509
I don't know, I want to get
in there and make a difference.

37:30.552 --> 37:32.859
Okay. Sounds vague,

37:32.902 --> 37:35.165
but, um, why don't
we talk about that

37:35.209 --> 37:40.258
after dinner, or better yet,
after Hawaii?

37:40.301 --> 37:41.911
:
Hawaii?
Yeah.

37:41.955 --> 37:45.045
I called the Four Seasons
Hualalai, and I got us a room.

37:45.088 --> 37:47.395
:
I-- mm.

37:47.439 --> 37:49.484
Mm.

37:53.140 --> 37:54.620
You know what?
I'm so sorry, I just,

37:54.663 --> 37:56.404
I have, I have a lot
to think about right now.

37:56.448 --> 37:57.971
I got to figure
a lot of stuff out,

37:58.014 --> 37:59.886
so, yeah, I can't.

37:59.929 --> 38:02.454
Hawaii-Hawaii has to wait.

38:03.933 --> 38:05.413
Rebecca, you are being so silly.

38:07.633 --> 38:09.374
I'm being silly?

38:09.417 --> 38:12.377
And selfish, too. I mean,
I-I, I just want us

38:12.420 --> 38:15.467
to be happy and together.

38:15.510 --> 38:16.685
That's what I want.

38:16.729 --> 38:18.948
Y-You just said
you love me, right?

38:18.992 --> 38:21.299
So can you just do that for me?

38:21.342 --> 38:24.345
Can you stop
overthinking everything?

38:24.389 --> 38:25.607
Okay, I'm not
overthinking things,

38:25.651 --> 38:28.741
I'm just trying
to be a good person.

38:28.784 --> 38:30.308
Really? Because from where
I'm sitting,

38:30.351 --> 38:33.267
every time we're happy,
you try to ruin it.

38:37.358 --> 38:39.317
Um...
I-I...

38:42.058 --> 38:43.756
Yeah, you should go
right now.

38:43.799 --> 38:45.758
Okay, fine.

38:50.371 --> 38:52.460
Oh! She's coming.
Go, go, go, go.

38:57.291 --> 38:59.815

38:59.859 --> 39:01.382
Darryl, you don't have
anything in your hands.

39:01.426 --> 39:02.731
So...

39:02.775 --> 39:04.472
what happened?

39:04.516 --> 39:06.518
I heard him mention Hawaii,
and then you started whispering.

39:06.561 --> 39:07.997
Which is rude.

39:08.041 --> 39:10.783
Look, I'm in love with him.
I am, but...

39:12.828 --> 39:15.788
...we just don't have
the same priorities right now.

39:17.224 --> 39:18.617
Maybe we won't ever,
I-I don't know.

39:18.660 --> 39:21.010
I truly don't know.

39:21.054 --> 39:23.535
All I know is I need
to find my own answer,

39:23.578 --> 39:26.538
and it lies somewhere

39:26.581 --> 39:30.237
between jail and Hawaii.

39:30.280 --> 39:33.414
So amazing those
are your choices.

39:33.458 --> 39:35.547
You know what?
I'll figure it out.

39:35.590 --> 39:37.462
Hey, Darryl

39:37.505 --> 39:39.333
Hook me up with some

39:42.945 --> 39:45.383
Oh. Thanks.

39:47.123 --> 39:48.734
HECTOR:
This is so confusing.

39:48.777 --> 39:50.779
I actually made ceviche.

I told her I thought

40:40.525 --> 40:41.482
it was a great idea.

40:41.526 --> 40:43.136
And the warden
approved it.

40:43.179 --> 40:44.572
So what do you
guys think?

40:44.616 --> 40:47.445
So she's not gonna sing?

40:47.488 --> 40:48.794
Or pick the songs?

40:48.837 --> 40:51.144
No. Again, I'm just,
I'm here to give legal advice.

40:51.187 --> 40:53.625
And she can't mention Sondheim.Duly noted.

40:53.668 --> 40:55.496
I do kind of like
the show Cats,though.

40:55.540 --> 40:57.455
Catsis cool.We should do Cats.

Great. Sign me up

Who doesn't like Cats?

41:04.200 --> 41:07.465
It's delightful.
Who cares if there's no plot?
