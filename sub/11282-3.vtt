CHRIS ROCK:
During football season
at Tattaglia,

00:06.307 --> 00:10.211
there was nothing more
important than Homecoming Week.

00:10.244 --> 00:11.545
Homecoming Dance?

00:11.579 --> 00:12.813
What are you looking
at that for?

00:12.846 --> 00:14.715
Just want to know
the date of the dance

00:14.748 --> 00:17.185
so I can start acting like
I'm sick three days before.

00:17.218 --> 00:18.619
It's a great excuse--
I'd use it,

00:18.652 --> 00:20.554
but nobody cares whether
I'm there or not.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.223
Why don't you
just go stag?

00:22.256 --> 00:23.491
End up dancing
by myself?

00:23.524 --> 00:24.792
I could do
that at home.

00:24.825 --> 00:27.528
* I'll be dancing with myself

00:27.561 --> 00:30.231
* Oh, I'll be dancing
with myself *

00:30.264 --> 00:33.301
Would you go dance with
yourself someplace else?!

00:33.334 --> 00:34.635
* Dancing with myself...

00:34.668 --> 00:36.737
Chris...

00:36.770 --> 00:39.073
I'd like you
to meet Jenise.

00:39.107 --> 00:41.209
Hi. I just transferred in.

00:41.242 --> 00:43.311
Jenise doesn't have
a date for the dance,

00:43.344 --> 00:45.579
and since all the other
black men are taken...

00:45.613 --> 00:47.115
By white women.

00:47.148 --> 00:48.782
...I thought you two
might go together.

00:48.816 --> 00:50.451
Well, anyway,

00:50.484 --> 00:52.586
I'll let Chris
lay his rap on you.

00:52.620 --> 00:53.487
Peace.

00:53.521 --> 00:55.456
I'm Audi 5000.

00:55.489 --> 00:56.657
So, do you want to go?

00:56.690 --> 00:59.493
Sure. I just don't want you
to feel like you have to go

00:59.527 --> 01:00.661
'cause she set you up.
No, it's cool.

01:00.694 --> 01:03.497
All you have to do is come by
so my parents can meet you.

01:03.531 --> 01:05.466
If they like you, we can go.

01:05.499 --> 01:06.500
That's cool.

01:06.534 --> 01:07.801
That will go great,

01:07.835 --> 01:09.503
because we all know--
everybody loves me.

01:09.537 --> 01:10.771
So, I'll see you later.

01:13.741 --> 01:15.609
Dude, you're going
to the Homecoming Dance?

01:15.643 --> 01:18.746
I guess so.
Great. My life sucks,
and what do you do?

01:18.779 --> 01:21.749
You make it suck worse.
What, do you want me
to stay at home

01:21.782 --> 01:24.252
and have a sucky night, too,
so you can feel better?

01:24.285 --> 01:25.819
Yeah. That's what
friends are for!

01:25.853 --> 01:29.757
With friends like that,
who needs enemies?

01:41.869 --> 01:44.638
* Ah, make it funky now.

01:44.672 --> 01:48.576

PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

02:03.224 --> 02:05.393
Since I was going
to the dance with Jenise,

02:05.426 --> 02:07.595
I needed to cancel
a date with Doc's.

02:07.628 --> 02:10.464
Drew, I need you to work my
shift Saturday night at Doc's.

02:10.498 --> 02:11.565
He's already
taking your place

02:11.599 --> 02:13.401
working after school.

02:13.434 --> 02:15.669
You need him to work
on weekends, too?

02:15.703 --> 02:17.171
Oh, it's okay, Mom.
I could use the money.

02:17.205 --> 02:18.539
Well, what do you have
to do anyway?

02:18.572 --> 02:20.541
I have a date
to the Homecoming Dance.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.610
TONYA:
A date

02:22.643 --> 02:24.712
Nothing. Her name's Jenise,
and she lives in Park Slope.

02:24.745 --> 02:25.846
ROCHELLE:
Park Slope?

02:25.879 --> 02:27.448
That's expensive.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.417
And she goes to your school?

02:29.450 --> 02:30.651
I told you there was
something wrong with her.

02:30.684 --> 02:32.253
She's retarded.

02:32.286 --> 02:33.687
Your brother's date
is not retarded.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.589
Well, she could be,
but there's different levels.

02:35.623 --> 02:36.857
She could be a moron,

02:36.890 --> 02:39.260
an imbecile,
an idiot or a cretin.

02:39.293 --> 02:41.329
Morons have the highest IQ
of the mentally retarded,

02:41.362 --> 02:42.696
so if something's
wrong with her,

02:42.730 --> 02:43.731
you may not notice at first.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.200
Like the first time
you watch Bill O'Reilly.

02:46.234 --> 02:48.536
Why is it so hard
to believe I have a date

02:48.569 --> 02:49.903
with a perfectly nice,
normal girl?

02:58.979 --> 03:01.649
(screeching
laughter)

03:10.858 --> 03:12.626
Hello

03:16.364 --> 03:18.732
(speaking indistinctly,
laughter continues)

03:18.766 --> 03:21.802
Oh... oh, stop.

03:21.835 --> 03:22.670
Whew!

03:22.703 --> 03:23.837
Whew!

03:23.871 --> 03:25.639
You finished?

03:25.673 --> 03:27.675
Yeah, yeah.
But you have to admit,

03:27.708 --> 03:29.877
that was pretty funny.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.645
ROCHELLE:
Oh, Drew
and Tonya,

03:31.679 --> 03:33.714
y'all go get ready for bed.

03:33.747 --> 03:35.449
Mm, mm, mm.

03:35.483 --> 03:37.451
Anyway, all she said was that

03:37.485 --> 03:38.652
I had to meet her parents,

03:38.686 --> 03:40.521
and if they say it's okay,
then we can go.

03:40.554 --> 03:41.689
What? Wait a minute, now.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.791
Who are they to be
checking out my son?

03:43.824 --> 03:45.426
I should be checking out
their daughter.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.728
Who knows what kind of floozy
she might be?

03:47.761 --> 03:48.896
I'd like to find out.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.598
Since you're going
for an inspection,

03:50.631 --> 03:52.566
make sure you make
a good impression.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.801
If I could do impressions,

03:53.834 --> 03:56.270
I'd still be
on Saturday Night Live.

03:56.304 --> 03:57.638
Meanwhile,
I wasn't the only one

03:57.671 --> 03:58.839
trying to impress a new girl.

03:58.872 --> 04:01.709
* Mr. Telephone Man

04:01.742 --> 04:04.612
* There's something wrong
with my line

04:04.645 --> 04:06.914
* When I dial
my baby's number *

04:06.947 --> 04:09.683
* I get a click every time...

04:09.717 --> 04:11.685
That's good! I didn't know
you could sing like that.

04:11.719 --> 04:13.387
Hey, Tonya.

04:13.421 --> 04:14.955
Hey, Youngblood.
Where y'all going?

04:14.988 --> 04:16.524
Oh, he's walking me home.

04:16.557 --> 04:17.791
Check you out.

04:17.825 --> 04:19.827
I heard you... singing.

04:19.860 --> 04:21.662
Now you're walking
people home?

04:21.695 --> 04:23.997
You're like a one-man
walking show.

04:24.031 --> 04:25.499
All chivalrous.

04:25.533 --> 04:26.900
You're like
Maurice Chevalier.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.702
James was a rare combination

04:28.736 --> 04:31.004
of French film buff and bug.

04:31.038 --> 04:33.307
Maybe I'll see you tomorrow.

04:33.341 --> 04:35.042
Come on, man.
Where you going?

04:35.075 --> 04:36.710
Don't leave. Let's sing.

04:36.744 --> 04:39.380
You be Ralph Tresvant.
I'll be Bobby Brown.

04:39.413 --> 04:40.714
Come on.
How come no one

04:40.748 --> 04:42.750
ever wants to be Ronnie DeVoe?

04:42.783 --> 04:44.017
What'd you do that for?

04:44.051 --> 04:45.453
I liked you before he did.

04:45.486 --> 04:46.820
How come I can't
walk you home?

04:46.854 --> 04:49.323
Because I'm going by myself.

04:49.357 --> 04:51.559
Meanwhile, Greg had gone

04:51.592 --> 04:53.994
from bad to worse,
like America under Bush.

04:54.027 --> 04:55.596
Greg, where you going?

04:55.629 --> 04:57.698
I'm out of here.
I just don't fit in anymore.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.066
I can't come back to this.

04:59.099 --> 05:00.868
At the Bronx Academy,
I was somebody.

05:00.901 --> 05:02.803
Yeah, you were the guy
who got kicked out.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.372
I wouldn't expect you
to understand.

05:04.405 --> 05:05.739
You're manager
of the football team.

05:05.773 --> 05:07.541
You got a date
to the Homecoming Dance.

05:07.575 --> 05:09.943
I'm just another reject.
Well, what are you
gonna do about it?

05:09.977 --> 05:11.979
Join the army; they
don't reject anybody.

05:12.012 --> 05:13.714
Rejected.

05:15.849 --> 05:16.884
Sorry.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.756
While Greg looked
for acceptance,

05:22.790 --> 05:24.892
Doc looked for business.

05:24.925 --> 05:27.528
Is all this stuff
past the expiration date?

05:27.561 --> 05:31.532
Yeah. I remember back
when I couldn't keep
a shelf stocked.

05:31.565 --> 05:32.866
:
I can't figure out

05:32.900 --> 05:34.868
why people don't come
in here no more.

05:34.902 --> 05:36.370
Because you don't sell crack.

05:36.404 --> 05:38.606
Could be because there's
a negative flow of energy.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.541
Or because you
don't sell crack.

05:40.574 --> 05:41.875
What you talking about?

05:41.909 --> 05:43.544
Feng shui-- it's
the Chinese practice

05:43.577 --> 05:44.945
of achieving harmony
in one's environment

05:44.978 --> 05:46.447
through the placement
of objects.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.382
I think feng shui
is the reason

05:48.416 --> 05:50.050
Mr. Fong's restaurant
is always so packed.

05:50.083 --> 05:52.586
And because Mr. Fong
sells crack.

05:52.620 --> 05:53.887
Feng shui, huh?

05:53.921 --> 05:57.124
I thought I was gonna
have to sell crack.

05:57.157 --> 05:58.959
Eh, what the hay.

05:58.992 --> 06:01.061
Do your thing.

06:01.094 --> 06:03.931
While Drew was setting up
to get some customers,

06:03.964 --> 06:06.500
I was setting up
to meet the parents.

06:06.534 --> 06:08.135
Wow, look at you.

06:08.168 --> 06:11.639
Looking like that, my
parents might think I'm
not good enough for you.

06:11.672 --> 06:13.040
I just don't want
anything to go wrong.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.775
Then send someone else
in your place.

06:14.808 --> 06:15.843
Everything'll be fine.

06:15.876 --> 06:18.579
I'll meet you at my
house after school.
Cool.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.885
What's your problem!

06:24.918 --> 06:25.586
Oops. Sorry.

06:25.619 --> 06:27.821
I forgot to say,
"Here, catch."

06:27.855 --> 06:30.658
Well, at least it's chocolate.
It'll blend in.

06:30.691 --> 06:32.893
I hope her family
likes chocolate.

06:36.597 --> 06:40.468
*

06:50.911 --> 06:54.482
:
What is all of this ringing
of the bells

06:54.515 --> 06:57.918
while I am eating
the sweet potato pop?

06:57.951 --> 06:59.920
Mmm.

07:01.589 --> 07:05.593
(audience applause,
whooping, whistling)

07:05.626 --> 07:07.961
Son, the homeless shelter's
around the corner.

07:09.162 --> 07:11.131
No, I'm not homeless.
I'm Chris.

07:11.164 --> 07:14.034
I'm taking Jenise
to the Homecoming Dance
this week at Tattaglia.

07:14.067 --> 07:15.669
In that?

07:17.104 --> 07:19.773
Jenise Huckstable!

07:19.807 --> 07:22.676
Downstairs! Now!

07:22.710 --> 07:24.845
Come in, son.

07:26.013 --> 07:30.718
(audience applause,
whooping, whistling)

07:30.751 --> 07:33.120
Oh, no!
Chris, what happened?

07:33.153 --> 07:34.722
After we met
in the hallway,

07:34.755 --> 07:37.558
this kid hit me with
a bowl of pudding.

07:37.591 --> 07:38.892
Here, come sit down.

07:38.926 --> 07:43.731
:
No, no, no,
don't sit down.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.799
Just in case
that's not pudding.

07:46.934 --> 07:49.937
Clint Huckstable,
what is wrong with you?

07:51.204 --> 07:52.540
Oh, my Lord.

07:52.573 --> 07:55.042
A motherless child.

07:55.075 --> 07:58.178
He's not a motherless
child.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.013
That's Chris.
We met at school.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.715
I got hit with a bowl
of pudding.

08:01.749 --> 08:03.784
Blair, the boy
has been abused.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.253
Well, I can take
your case.

08:06.286 --> 08:08.021
I'm a lawyer, you know.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.690
I am very accomplished.

08:09.723 --> 08:11.024
Yes, and I would like

08:11.058 --> 08:12.993
to accomplish something
with you later on,

08:13.026 --> 08:14.695
:
if you know
what I mean.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.163
BLAIR :
Stop it, Clint.

08:16.196 --> 08:19.166
So, Chris, where
are you from?

08:19.199 --> 08:20.934
Bed-Stuy.
Now, I heard

08:20.968 --> 08:22.035
about that place.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.004
I sent a boy to jail from there.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.873
He was

08:25.906 --> 08:27.307
selling something called crack.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.810
All the babies from there
are on it.

08:29.843 --> 08:33.080
Are you a crack baby?

08:33.113 --> 08:34.915
No, sir.

08:34.948 --> 08:35.949
Now, Chris,

08:35.983 --> 08:37.818
do you have a family?

08:37.851 --> 08:40.120
Yeah, a mother, father,
sister, brother.

08:40.153 --> 08:44.291
Are they crack people?

08:44.324 --> 08:46.226
No, sir.

08:46.259 --> 08:48.261
What kind of law
does your mother practice?

08:48.295 --> 08:50.530
She works in the beauty salon.

08:52.099 --> 08:53.934
And what does
your father do?

08:53.967 --> 08:55.235
Oh, he has two jobs.
Oh, so

08:55.268 --> 08:57.004
he's a doctor and a lawyer.

08:57.037 --> 08:59.006
No, he drives a truck

08:59.039 --> 09:01.208
and does security part-time.

09:03.310 --> 09:06.279
I see.

09:06.313 --> 09:08.281
Well, Chris,

09:08.315 --> 09:10.951
much like your people
from Bed-Stuy,

09:10.984 --> 09:13.721
our daughter here is a screwup.

09:13.754 --> 09:17.224
Yeah, and instead
of wasting money

09:17.257 --> 09:19.660
on a good private school,

09:19.693 --> 09:22.830
we decided to teach her a lesson
and send her

09:22.863 --> 09:25.032
to the Tattaglia public school.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.167
And then she decided
to teach us a lesson

09:27.200 --> 09:29.670
by bringing you home.

09:31.271 --> 09:35.108
But we are not going
to penalize you

09:35.142 --> 09:37.945
for her stupidity.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.249
Chris, we have decided

09:42.282 --> 09:45.252
to let you take
our daughter Jenise

09:45.285 --> 09:48.989
to the Homecoming Dance.

09:49.022 --> 09:50.057
(audience cheering
and applause)

09:50.090 --> 09:51.358
CHRIS:
Thank you, sir.

09:52.392 --> 09:54.962
You're welcome.

09:54.995 --> 09:58.298
And we have this lovely
sweater here

09:58.331 --> 10:02.169
so you have something
decent to wear.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.104
Also...

10:04.137 --> 10:06.239
this delicious box

10:06.273 --> 10:08.241
of sweet potato pops.

10:12.345 --> 10:14.347
While I was working
on the Huckstables,

10:14.381 --> 10:16.416
James was working
on Tonya's nerves.

10:16.449 --> 10:21.054
Where's Jason? He was supposed
to meet me, not you.

10:21.088 --> 10:23.023
You mean Maurice? I don't know.
But I know this much:

10:23.056 --> 10:24.892
If I was supposed to walk you
to school,

10:24.925 --> 10:26.393
when you came out, I'd be there

10:26.426 --> 10:28.796
even if somebody threatened me
with a tire iron.

10:28.829 --> 10:30.263
She wishes she had a tire iron.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.700
But I'll walk you, you know,
since he's not here.

10:32.733 --> 10:34.434
I don't want you to walk me
to school.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.402
Leave me alone.

10:35.435 --> 10:37.738
That's how girls turned down
R. Kelly.

10:37.771 --> 10:41.709
While Tonya wanted to be alone,
Doc had plenty of company.

10:45.746 --> 10:48.849
Wow, this feng shui thing
is something else.

10:48.882 --> 10:50.818
Business hasn't
been this good

10:50.851 --> 10:53.186
since they robbed
the food stamp truck.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.055
What's this?

10:55.088 --> 10:56.256
This is a money tree.

10:56.289 --> 10:57.758
It'll bring you
good fortune.

10:57.791 --> 11:00.260
Looks like
it's working.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.132
Can I help you?

11:05.165 --> 11:07.400
That's English for
"I don't speak Chinese."

11:07.434 --> 11:10.470
Doc's business was
at an all-time high,

11:10.503 --> 11:12.806
and Greg was at
an all-time low.

11:12.840 --> 11:16.109
Greg, get up.

11:16.143 --> 11:18.779
I mean, I know getting kicked
out of the Bronx Academy sucked,

11:18.812 --> 11:19.713
but things can work out.

11:19.747 --> 11:20.647
Yeah, it's easy for you to say.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.849
You're not the one
with the miserable life.

11:21.882 --> 11:27.254
What show have you been on
for the last three years?

11:27.287 --> 11:29.790
Maybe you just need
to get involved
with something.

11:29.823 --> 11:30.791
Like what?

11:30.824 --> 11:31.792
Like a shower.

11:31.825 --> 11:33.727
I got an idea.

11:33.761 --> 11:35.428
Your school mascot,
a sleeping fish.

11:35.462 --> 11:37.965
What about it?

11:37.998 --> 11:39.733
Well, they need a new guy.

11:39.767 --> 11:41.168
The other guy quit.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.103
So, what, you think me
running around the sidelines

11:43.136 --> 11:46.373
at a football game
wearing a giant fish
suit's gonna help me?

11:46.406 --> 11:48.275
Really?
That's what you think?

11:48.308 --> 11:50.911
Well, everybody loves him.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.379
And they've never
lost a game

11:52.412 --> 11:53.981
with him on
the sidelines.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.482
I don't know.

11:55.515 --> 11:58.151
Trust me.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.325
Hey, Greg, you look great.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.027
Hey, Chris, you're lying.

12:07.060 --> 12:09.229
All right, Bassie, I want you
to get out there today,

12:09.262 --> 12:11.799
you run around that field,
you get us a win.
You understand?

12:11.832 --> 12:12.933
Isn't that what
the players are for?

12:12.966 --> 12:14.868
Move it or lose it,
towel boy.

12:17.805 --> 12:18.638
Greg, come on.

12:18.671 --> 12:21.074
No, I got to wait
for a car to take me.

12:21.108 --> 12:21.909
I got this big suit.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.511
Oh, well, good luck.
Catch you later.

12:24.544 --> 12:27.214
While I was gonna catch Greg
later,

12:27.247 --> 12:29.783
some other guys were gonna
catch Greg now.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.191
While Greg was nowhere
to be found,

12:38.225 --> 12:40.227
Doc couldn't find anything.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.462
Drew, where did you put
the hot sauce?

12:42.495 --> 12:45.565
What you mean,
it disrupted the chi?

12:45.598 --> 12:47.034
Okay, then where's the chi?

12:47.067 --> 12:48.802
Where the hot sauce used to be.

12:48.836 --> 12:51.471
Well, I can't pour
a philosophical concept

12:51.504 --> 12:53.406
on my catfish, now can I?

12:53.440 --> 12:56.209
Think. I'll call you back.

12:56.243 --> 12:58.445
Meanwhile,
history was made today

12:58.478 --> 13:02.549
when the Tattaglia Sleeping Fish
lost their homecoming game

13:02.582 --> 13:08.255
to the Clemenza Fighting
Silencers by a score of 68 to 2.

13:08.288 --> 13:10.457
We fought a good fight,
but we lost.

13:10.490 --> 13:12.125
But ultimately,
I have to blame the loss

13:12.159 --> 13:13.293
on our mascot Bassie.

13:13.326 --> 13:16.163
He was a no-show,
and we lost.

13:16.196 --> 13:18.431
Hope you're happy
about that, Bassie,

13:18.465 --> 13:22.269
You happy now
You see what you did.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.872
Tomorrow night
at Madison Square Garden,

13:24.905 --> 13:25.873
light heavyweight contenders...

13:25.906 --> 13:28.275
Yeah!
Yeah!

13:36.616 --> 13:37.584
Greg, what happened?

13:37.617 --> 13:39.052
I got fishnapped.

13:39.086 --> 13:41.188
You okay?
No, I'm not okay.

13:41.221 --> 13:42.622
I spent the last three hours
in the back of a van

13:42.655 --> 13:44.257
with a giant fish suit on me

13:44.291 --> 13:45.859
with guys trying
to force-feed me worms.

13:45.893 --> 13:46.927
I hope that wasn't a metaphor.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.329
Just calm down.
No, you calm down.

13:49.362 --> 13:51.464
Go to your stupid homecoming
dance with your stupid date.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.200
And stop trying to pretend
you understand me

13:53.233 --> 13:54.567
'cause you don't,
okay, pop star?

13:54.601 --> 13:56.436
The only thing
you can do for me

13:56.469 --> 13:57.837
is to kiss my white....

13:59.239 --> 14:01.141
Way to lose homecoming, tadpole.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.642
I'm glad Caruso punched him,

14:02.675 --> 14:04.144
because it would have ruined
our friendship

14:04.177 --> 14:05.946
if I had had to do it myself.

14:09.582 --> 14:12.152
By the time homecoming night
came around,

14:12.185 --> 14:13.921
even though Greg
wouldn't talk to me,

14:13.954 --> 14:16.890
I probably couldn't hear him
because my sweater was so loud.

14:16.924 --> 14:18.025
That sweater looks stupid.

14:18.058 --> 14:20.627
I would have a comeback,
but unfortunately I agree.

14:20.660 --> 14:22.562
Bet you a dollar
she doesn't show up.

14:22.595 --> 14:23.630
Tonya, she'll show up.

14:23.663 --> 14:27.667
Chris, she doesn't show up,
just give us a call.

14:27.700 --> 14:28.936
We'll come get you.

14:28.969 --> 14:32.973
Nothing like a parent's love
to destroy your confidence.

14:33.006 --> 14:33.941
Meanwhile, Drew learned

14:33.974 --> 14:36.243
you can't teach an old Doc
new tricks.

14:36.276 --> 14:38.378
Doc, what happened?

14:38.411 --> 14:39.612
I couldn't figure out

14:39.646 --> 14:42.149
why Chinese people
put hot sauce next
to peanut butter.

14:42.182 --> 14:43.984
And your fortune
inside a cookie.

14:44.017 --> 14:45.685
So I changed
everything back.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.988
Money won't do me
any good if I go crazy

14:48.021 --> 14:49.256
before I try to spend it.

14:49.289 --> 14:52.259
So I said "Sayonara"
to feng shui.

14:52.292 --> 14:54.694
Sayonara isn't Chinese.
It's Japanese.

14:54.727 --> 14:55.662
Hey, I just read this thing

14:55.695 --> 14:57.664
about this new Japanese food
called "sushi."

14:57.697 --> 14:59.566
It's supposed to be
the next big thing in America.

14:59.599 --> 15:00.600
Maybe we could
sell it here.

15:00.633 --> 15:01.668
Sushi?

15:01.701 --> 15:04.171
Yeah, it's like raw fish
wrapped in seaweed and rice.

15:04.204 --> 15:06.940
That sounds as good as hamburger
made out of turkey.

15:06.974 --> 15:12.145
Do I have to tell you
Doc went broke?

15:14.514 --> 15:16.183
What the heck is that?

15:16.216 --> 15:17.384
"Careless Whisper."

15:17.417 --> 15:23.957
* But it's easy to pretend,
I know you're not a fool *

15:23.991 --> 15:27.060
* I should have known better
than to cheat a friend *

15:27.094 --> 15:28.028
* And waste this chance...

15:28.061 --> 15:29.062
Oh, my God!

15:29.096 --> 15:30.998
What the hell?

15:31.031 --> 15:37.637
* So I'm never gonna dance again
the way I danced with you *

15:37.670 --> 15:40.707
Turn it off. Sit down.

15:44.077 --> 15:47.047
Didn't I tell you
to leave my daughter alone?

15:47.080 --> 15:48.748
Look, I'm just trying
to show her I like her.

15:48.781 --> 15:49.716
She gets it.

15:49.749 --> 15:52.052
But you can't make somebody
like you back.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.487
At least not without a lot
of fame and money.

15:54.521 --> 15:55.355
Between me and you,

15:55.388 --> 15:56.456
I ain't letting her go
without a fight.

15:56.489 --> 16:01.094
Are you talking about a fight
for her or with me?

16:02.595 --> 16:05.632
Just tell her
when she gets tired
of Jason, I'm available.

16:05.665 --> 16:07.200
I'll do that.

16:07.234 --> 16:09.002
No, he won't.

16:09.036 --> 16:11.338
While Tonya had
an unwanted visitor at home,

16:11.371 --> 16:14.141
I had an unwanted visitor
at homecoming.

16:14.174 --> 16:16.043
Mom, what are you doing here?

16:16.076 --> 16:18.345
Greg's aunt called.
He never came home last night.

16:18.378 --> 16:20.447
Do you have any idea
where he might be?

16:20.480 --> 16:21.514
I don't know.

16:21.548 --> 16:22.649
You realize that if you don't
take me to the dance,

16:22.682 --> 16:24.717
you'll never have
a chance of going
out with me again.

16:24.751 --> 16:25.718
I know.

16:25.752 --> 16:26.753
You know or you don't know?

16:26.786 --> 16:27.754
Huh?

16:27.787 --> 16:28.555
Chris, if you don't come
and find me right away,

16:28.588 --> 16:30.457
you know this
can end badly for me.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.124
I know.

16:31.158 --> 16:32.425
Well, then come on.
What?

16:32.459 --> 16:33.293
Let's go get Greg.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.727
You say you know where he is,
right?

16:34.761 --> 16:35.262
Yeah.

16:35.295 --> 16:36.663
You better hurry, man.

16:36.696 --> 16:37.697
Why don't you
leave him alone?

16:37.730 --> 16:39.732
You know he wants to go
to the dance with me.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.068
I really do.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.001
Well, then come on.

16:42.035 --> 16:43.536
He doesn't care about you.
He just met you.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.772
He's known me
for years.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.307
I can't leave Greg hanging.
Ha!

16:47.340 --> 16:48.275
Let's go, boy!

16:48.308 --> 16:49.409
You're standing me up?

16:49.442 --> 16:50.743
What?

16:50.777 --> 16:53.046
I'm on the edge, man!
Stop yelling at me!

16:53.080 --> 16:54.181
Look, I don't care

16:54.214 --> 16:56.616
who's missing. You holler at me
like that one more time,

16:56.649 --> 16:57.784
you gonna come up missing.

17:00.187 --> 17:04.091
I'm sorry.
You should be.

17:04.124 --> 17:05.825
You better be.
Now come on.

17:05.858 --> 17:08.695
Man, that scene put
the "azy" in crazy.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.411
How'd you know where to find me?

17:24.444 --> 17:26.213
Your best friend,

17:26.246 --> 17:28.381
plus the Bronx Academy
was the last place you were

17:28.415 --> 17:29.649
before everything went wrong.

17:29.682 --> 17:31.218
Well, now you found me,

17:31.251 --> 17:33.486
just leave me and let me rot.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.222
Greg, I'm getting tired
of your complaining.

17:35.255 --> 17:36.456
I've been getting knocked down
for years

17:36.489 --> 17:37.624
and you don't see me whining.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.559
I just get up
and dust myself off.

17:39.592 --> 17:42.129
Of course you do--
you're black.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.131
You overcame slavery,
lynchings and racism.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.432
You know how to deal
with suffering.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.500
I'm a white guy;
I'm supposed to have it easy.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.302
Greg, right now,
I'm standing up

17:49.336 --> 17:50.670
at the most perfect girl
in the world.

17:50.703 --> 17:52.439
Her family is amazing.

17:52.472 --> 17:53.773
They clapped when I entered.

17:53.806 --> 17:55.475
They laughed at everything
I said.

17:55.508 --> 17:56.543
They gave me sweet potato pops.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.145
They even gave me this sweater.

17:58.178 --> 18:00.113
This sweater cost
more than our car.

18:00.147 --> 18:01.848
Her parents are
a lawyer and a doctor.

18:01.881 --> 18:03.816
Last time I saw a lawyer
and a doctor together

18:03.850 --> 18:05.252
was when my uncle went
to the hospital

18:05.285 --> 18:07.187
for a routine checkup
and came out dead.

18:07.220 --> 18:09.189
So if you don't get
your harmonica-playing,

18:09.222 --> 18:10.323
hole-in-the-sock-wearing,

18:10.357 --> 18:13.193
woe-is-me, I-should-have-
everything-easy behind up,

18:13.226 --> 18:15.595
I'm gonna smack
the crack out of you!

18:15.628 --> 18:17.564
Oh, man, the dance.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.667
You missed your date
with Jenise to come and find me?

18:20.700 --> 18:24.137
Don't sweat it. You would
have done the same thing for me.

18:24.171 --> 18:28.141
When the situation came up
years later, he didn't.

18:28.175 --> 18:31.278
The next day, I went to deliver
the Huckstables an apology,

18:31.311 --> 18:32.612
but they had come to get it
themselves.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.181
What the...?

18:34.214 --> 18:38.418
Aha! Now you know what it's like
to come into your home

18:38.451 --> 18:40.387
and not believe

18:40.420 --> 18:42.589
what the eyes
are seeing

18:42.622 --> 18:45.892
because your daughter is
boo-hooing, shedding the tears.

18:45.925 --> 18:47.160
Who the hell are you?

18:47.194 --> 18:50.663
I am Dr. Clint Huckstable.

18:50.697 --> 18:53.700
And I am the father
of the daughter

18:53.733 --> 18:55.602
shedding
all the tears

18:55.635 --> 18:57.904
because the son
of the mother

18:57.937 --> 19:02.175
from Bed-Stuy...
stood her up

19:02.209 --> 19:04.911
at the Tattaglia-talia
public school homecoming dance.

19:04.944 --> 19:07.347
How did you get
into my house?

19:07.380 --> 19:08.881
The crack baby let me in.

19:08.915 --> 19:11.251
I'm not a crack baby.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.652
I'm really sorry.

19:12.685 --> 19:14.321
We just left your house, but...

19:14.354 --> 19:16.956
What kind of parent
would raise a boy

19:16.989 --> 19:20.493
that would make my future
lawyer-daughter cry

19:20.527 --> 19:22.862
with all the tears?

19:22.895 --> 19:23.896
Now hold on.

19:23.930 --> 19:26.199
If you're such a good parent,

19:26.233 --> 19:28.901
how come your retarded
daughter flunked out
of private school

19:28.935 --> 19:31.571
and had to go
to Tata-Tata-Tataglia

19:31.604 --> 19:33.373
public school?

19:33.406 --> 19:34.707
The point is...

19:34.741 --> 19:36.676
You better say the right thing,

19:36.709 --> 19:39.546
because I swear I will slap
the sweet potato pop out of you.

19:39.579 --> 19:42.782
All I am saying is
that my little girl

19:42.815 --> 19:45.652
had her feelings hurt.

19:45.685 --> 19:46.919
You did?

19:46.953 --> 19:48.621
I had to even ask my father

19:48.655 --> 19:49.856
if I could transfer permanently.

19:49.889 --> 19:54.227
I thought you're funny,
cute, edgy, and cool.

19:54.261 --> 19:56.229
You did?
Yes.

19:56.263 --> 19:57.330
But now I hate you.

19:57.364 --> 20:00.933
All it took was one phone call.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.802
Now give me back
my sweater.

20:02.835 --> 20:05.204
With pleasure.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.276
Thank you, sporty.

20:09.309 --> 20:12.845
Let's go.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.847
Ma, aren't you gonna
say anything?

20:16.416 --> 20:19.252
Well, you could
have called.

20:19.286 --> 20:23.290
* Everybody hates Chris.

20:40.006 --> 20:42.575
* Aw, make it funky now.
