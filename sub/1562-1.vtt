I came across the term while reading...

01:53:09.129 --> 01:53:12.121
...and I didn't fully understand it.

01:53:12.299 --> 01:53:14.039
I'm not sure what you
were reading, Tom...

01:53:14.218 --> 01:53:16.782
...but this is very dark stuff,
very dark indeed.

01:53:16.970 --> 01:53:18.503
Which is...

01:53:19.639 --> 01:53:21.463
...why I came to you.

01:53:24.311 --> 01:53:29.929
A Horcrux is an object in which a person
has concealed part of their soul.

01:53:30.107 --> 01:53:32.725
But I don't understand
how that works, sir.

01:53:35.320 --> 01:53:39.314
One splits one's soul and hides
part of it in an object.

01:53:39.490 --> 01:53:43.108
By doing so, you're protected, should
you be attacked and your body destroyed.

01:53:43.284 --> 01:53:44.391
Protected?

01:53:44.578 --> 01:53:47.779
That part of your soul
that is hidden lives on.

01:53:49.249 --> 01:53:51.648
In other words, you cannot die.

01:53:58.843 --> 01:54:02.001
And how does one split his soul, sir?

01:54:02.178 --> 01:54:04.963
SLUGHORN: I think you already know
the answer to that, Tom.

01:54:06.182 --> 01:54:07.673
Murder.

01:54:08.184 --> 01:54:09.508
Yes.

01:54:10.060 --> 01:54:14.970
Killing rips the soul apart.
It is a violation against nature.

01:54:15.858 --> 01:54:20.602
RIDDLE: Can you only split the soul
once? For instance, isn't seven...?

01:54:20.779 --> 01:54:22.271
Seven?

01:54:23.031 --> 01:54:28.318
Merlin's beard, Tom. Isn't it bad enough
to consider killing one person?

01:54:28.495 --> 01:54:32.238
To rip the soul into seven pieces...

01:54:33.415 --> 01:54:36.450
This is all hypothetical, isn't it, Tom?
All academic?

01:54:41.214 --> 01:54:42.538
Of course, sir.

01:54:45.510 --> 01:54:47.502
It'll be our little secret.

01:54:56.312 --> 01:54:57.553
HARRY:
Sir.

01:55:12.952 --> 01:55:15.069
This is beyond anything I imagined.

01:55:15.246 --> 01:55:17.915
You mean to say he succeeded, sir,
in making a Horcrux?

01:55:18.083 --> 01:55:21.200
Oh, yes, he succeeded, all right.
And not just once.

01:55:21.376 --> 01:55:22.398
What are they exactly?

01:55:22.586 --> 01:55:25.912
Could be anything.
Most commonplace of objects.

01:55:29.093 --> 01:55:30.791
A ring, for example.

01:55:31.427 --> 01:55:32.919
Or a book.

01:55:34.222 --> 01:55:36.589
- Tom Riddle's diary.
- It's a Horcrux, yes.

01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:39.215
Four years ago, when you saved
Ginny's life...

01:55:39.394 --> 01:55:41.676
...in the Chamber of Secrets,
you brought me this.

01:55:41.854 --> 01:55:43.763
I knew this was
a different kind of magic.

01:55:43.939 --> 01:55:48.934
Very dark, very powerful. But until tonight
I had no idea just how powerful.

01:55:49.110 --> 01:55:51.103
- The ring?
- Belonged to Voldemort's mother.

01:55:51.488 --> 01:55:56.232
Difficult to find.
Even more difficult to destroy.

01:55:56.410 --> 01:56:00.266
But if you could find them all,
if you did destroy each Horcrux...

01:56:00.455 --> 01:56:01.612
One destroys Voldemort.

01:56:01.789 --> 01:56:04.697
But how would you find them?
They could be hidden anywhere.

01:56:04.875 --> 01:56:08.118
True. But magic, especially dark magic...

01:56:22.100 --> 01:56:23.966
...leaves traces.

01:56:31.776 --> 01:56:33.850
It's where you've been going,
isn't it, sir?

01:56:34.027 --> 01:56:36.310
- When you leave the school?
- Yes.

01:56:37.155 --> 01:56:40.230
And I think perhaps
I may have found another.

01:56:40.408 --> 01:56:44.485
But this time,
I cannot hope to destroy it alone.

01:56:46.038 --> 01:56:50.700
Once again,
I must ask too much of you, Harry.

01:56:54.672 --> 01:56:56.955
SNAPE: Have you ever considered
that you ask too much...

01:56:57.132 --> 01:56:59.749
...that you take too much for granted?

01:56:59.926 --> 01:57:04.962
Has it ever crossed your brilliant mind
that I don't want to do this anymore?

01:57:05.139 --> 01:57:07.257
Whether it has or hasn't is irrelevant.

01:57:08.142 --> 01:57:13.930
I will not negotiate with you, Severus.
You agreed. Nothing more to discuss.

01:57:32.331 --> 01:57:33.947
Oh, Harry.

01:57:36.543 --> 01:57:38.869
You need a shave, my friend.

01:57:41.673 --> 01:57:45.876
You know, at times,
I forget how much you've grown.

01:57:46.052 --> 01:57:49.994

from the cupboard.

I'm afraid.

is extremely dangerous.
