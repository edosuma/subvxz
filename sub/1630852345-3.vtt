We can release the life rafts!

We'll be sitting ducks in them

00:53.553 --> 00:55.305
-Get in the hauler!
-What? Why?

00:55.388 --> 00:57.390
So we can sink to the bottom of the sea?

00:57.474 --> 01:00.769
Underwater upgrades.
The hauler can become a submarine. Go!

-Bro! No way.

Now we make sure he and his friends
are out of picture,

otherwise they bring

You have to repeat what I say when I

See? I'm getting the hang of this.

03:28.416 --> 03:31.336
Except the force of the explosion
disabled our cloaking.

03:31.419 --> 03:32.712
I'll try to get it back.

03:32.795 --> 03:35.173
Ugh! This is gonna take a while.

03:35.256 --> 03:39.177
No, it's okay, bro. The weight of the
armor has taken us out of strafing range.

03:39.260 --> 03:42.347
Even if Sudarikov can see us,
he can't hit us at this depth.

-No. You don't have to repeat that.

Man, I don't understand
these stupid submarine rules.

We're in a floating trailer right now.

Do not disrespect this craft

They've gone deeper

I'd recommend a depth charge protocol.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.078
Deploy charges.

04:05.161 --> 04:07.914
You know,
what's interesting about depth charges is

04:07.997 --> 04:11.793
they detonate based on a little something
called hydrostatic pressure.

04:12.377 --> 04:15.088
Depending on the pressure
exerted by a fluid at equilibri--

04:15.171 --> 04:16.172

were exploding around 150 feet.

You stayed strong, Julius!

Alright. Let's get down below radar,
where Sudarikov can't track us.

06:42.276 --> 06:44.028
Frostee, how are our systems looking?

06:44.112 --> 06:46.030
We have 24 hours' worth of oxygen,

at 60% capacity.

Oh, we lost them!

07:00.086 --> 07:00.920
Not to worry.

07:01.003 --> 07:05.716
We can release the sonobuoy to locate
the hauler at lower depths using sonar.

That's an acronym
for sound navigation ranging.
