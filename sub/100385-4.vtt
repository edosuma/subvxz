a fifth, sixth, seventh date
kind of thing.

06:09.673 --> 06:12.756

06:15.255 --> 06:17.547

-Oh, would I?

06:19.381 --> 06:20.798

-Larry: Really?
What did you have...
-It was a while ago.

07:04.297 --> 07:07.005
...some, uh,
was it some kind of
medical thing?

07:07.089 --> 07:08.422
You were taking medicine, or...

07:08.506 --> 07:11.381
-Nah, just lifestyle,
you know.
-...drugs?

07:11.464 --> 07:12.714
How long ago was that?

07:12.798 --> 07:15.589
I don't know.
Year and a half, maybe.

07:15.673 --> 07:18.047
So you got down to this?

07:18.130 --> 07:20.923
Uh, you look disturbed.
(chuckles)

07:21.005 --> 07:22.047
No, no, no.

07:22.130 --> 07:24.798
It's the contrast
that's, uh, disturbing.

07:24.881 --> 07:26.964
It's, it's like, if you saw
a picture of me with hair
a year ago,

07:27.047 --> 07:29.631
and then you met me
and I was bald,
you'd be disturbed, too.

07:29.714 --> 07:30.964
I'd think
you'd lost some hair.

07:31.047 --> 07:33.089
-But are you still losing?
-Am I--

07:33.172 --> 07:35.172

-Weight, are you
still losing weight?

07:35.255 --> 07:36.506
Are we on a first date?

07:36.589 --> 07:38.964
-I'm just curious.
-I am-- Well, I don't know.

07:39.047 --> 07:41.422
-I guess it depends--
-Or, or, or are,
are you gaining?

07:41.506 --> 07:44.714
-Are you gaining?
-I think everybody fluctuates.

07:44.798 --> 07:47.255
-It happens. Yeah.
-Yes.

07:47.339 --> 07:49.673
-What I know is I--
-Well, you look fantastic.

07:49.756 --> 07:51.756
-Well, thank you.
Thank you.
-Yeah.

07:52.839 --> 07:55.756
(speaking Japanese)
Uh, please accept
a free dessert.

07:55.839 --> 07:58.047
Oh, it, it's not necessary.
We don't need dessert.

07:58.130 --> 08:00.464
-Oh, thank you very much.
-Arigato.

08:00.547 --> 08:01.631
-It's very kind.
-Fine.

08:01.714 --> 08:03.297
What are you doing?
We don't need this.

08:03.381 --> 08:04.422
Oh, come on.

08:04.506 --> 08:06.130
-It's green tea ice cream.
-Larry: Oh.

08:06.214 --> 08:07.798
-Wrapped in, like,
this rice paper.
-No, you don't want--

08:07.881 --> 08:10.547
Are you kidding me?
I definitely want this.
Try one.

08:12.089 --> 08:13.506
Mm. Mm!

08:13.589 --> 08:15.964
What is better than dessert?
(chuckles)

08:16.047 --> 08:17.547
Oh, my God.

08:17.631 --> 08:19.756
Leon (whispering):
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

08:19.839 --> 08:22.422
Larry:
I looked at that picture,
I almost fainted.

08:22.506 --> 08:25.089
I had to ask her,
"Is that you?"
That's what I said to her.

08:25.172 --> 08:27.339
-Wow, man.
-It's like she ate herself.

08:27.422 --> 08:30.506
-Fuck.
-It was, it was only
a year and a half ago.

08:30.589 --> 08:33.047
You know what
the fuck that means?
She's a fuckin' yo-yo.

08:33.130 --> 08:34.839
-Yeah, she's a yo-yo. Yeah.
-Leon: Yeah.

08:34.923 --> 08:37.673
-You don't know if that yo-yo's
goin' down or the fuck up.
-Yeah.

08:37.756 --> 08:39.881
All signs point to her
yo-ing up.

08:39.964 --> 08:41.881
She ate this big dessert.

08:41.964 --> 08:43.381
You are in a fucked up
position right now.

08:43.464 --> 08:46.005
-Yeah.
-You gotta take her
yo-yo ass to Mexico.

08:46.089 --> 08:48.506
-I have to, right?
-Yeah. You got to now.

08:48.589 --> 08:49.631
I know.

08:49.714 --> 08:52.339
-Hey! Look at this.
-Leon: Ha-ha!

08:52.422 --> 08:55.172
-My lens cloth. Nice.
-Yeah. Look at that shit.

08:55.255 --> 08:58.464
Did you ever find
the old one?
Did you ever see that?

08:58.547 --> 08:59.714
No. Never seen it.

08:59.798 --> 09:01.964
-Weird.
-(Leon sucking fingers)

09:02.047 --> 09:03.673
What the hell happened to that?

09:03.756 --> 09:05.005
-(phone rings)
-(sucks fingers)

09:05.089 --> 09:07.297
Larry:
Oh, this is from,
the, uh, the plane

09:07.381 --> 09:09.214
-that we're taking to Mexico.
-Leon: Mm-hmm.

09:09.297 --> 09:12.089
"To ensure the safety...
require...

09:12.172 --> 09:15.506
the weight of each passenger
who will be flying."

09:15.589 --> 09:17.005
Oh, my God.

09:17.089 --> 09:18.714
(scoffs) I gotta ask her
her weight now?

09:18.798 --> 09:20.714
-No way I'm asking her
her weight.
-Goddamn it.

09:20.798 --> 09:22.089
-Impossible.
-Impossible.

09:22.172 --> 09:24.631
What's your weight, by the way?
I'm gonna need it.

09:24.714 --> 09:26.422
-That ain't happening.
-What are you, crazy?

09:26.506 --> 09:29.172
-Why not? I need your weight.
-That's too much information.

09:29.255 --> 09:31.214
They, they just asked for it.
It's for safety.

09:31.297 --> 09:33.673
If that pilot needs my weight
to fly that plane safely,

09:33.756 --> 09:35.047
he need another fuckin' plane.

09:35.130 --> 09:37.923
And you need to keep an eye
on your girl over there

09:38.005 --> 09:39.631
for eating that garbage
in Mexico.

09:39.714 --> 09:41.714
You know,
sometimes it's really hard

09:41.798 --> 09:44.214
to stop a person
who's very determined

09:44.297 --> 09:46.047
-from eating garbage.
-You're fuckin' right.

09:46.130 --> 09:48.214
-Larry: Yeah. For example...
-They get consumed
with that shit.

09:48.297 --> 09:49.339
Suppose I took your tray
like this.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.589
Come on, Larry,
stop fuckin' around.

09:50.673 --> 09:52.255
-What are you gonna do then?
-Oh, shit!

09:52.339 --> 09:53.547
-What about that? Huh?
-Leon: You fucked up now!

09:53.631 --> 09:54.839
-You fucked up, Larry!
-Yeah. Here.

09:54.923 --> 09:56.172
-Oh, you fuckin' terrible.
-Enjoy.

09:56.255 --> 09:57.631
Fuck you, Larry!

09:57.714 --> 10:00.047
Now I gotta eat my shit
with a spoon.

10:00.130 --> 10:02.381
(knocking)

10:02.464 --> 10:04.714
(whistling)

10:04.798 --> 10:07.631
Oh, wow! What do you know.

10:07.714 --> 10:09.214
Look at this.

10:09.297 --> 10:11.130
-Look who's here.
-I didn't know you were coming.

10:11.214 --> 10:14.005
I didn't know you were coming.
What a surprise.

10:14.089 --> 10:16.506
We were just talking about,
uh, our trip.

10:16.589 --> 10:17.923
-To Cabo.
-Susie: Yeah.

10:18.005 --> 10:19.881
-Cheryl: For Mickey's wedding.
-What's the problem?

10:19.964 --> 10:21.255
You're invited
to Mickey's wedding?

10:21.339 --> 10:23.130
-Why does that surprise you?
-I'm just shocked.

10:23.214 --> 10:25.047
-Larry: Oh, my God.
-Why wouldn't he invite me?

10:25.130 --> 10:26.547
You know, you just,
you don't invite

10:26.631 --> 10:27.714
a divorced couple
to a wedding.

10:27.798 --> 10:29.589
It's a very combustible
situation.

10:29.673 --> 10:31.130
Who, who knows
what could happen?

10:31.214 --> 10:33.464
It makes people
uncomfortable to see
a divorced couple.

10:33.547 --> 10:35.464
-He should choose sides.
Pick one.
-Susie: Well,

10:35.547 --> 10:37.506
you're both invited,
so deal with it.

10:37.589 --> 10:39.297
Everything's gonna be fine.

10:39.381 --> 10:41.089
Cheryl, you're gonna come
on the plane with us, right?

10:41.172 --> 10:42.673
We're flying private.

10:42.756 --> 10:44.297
Yeah, we're all
splitting a plane.

10:44.381 --> 10:45.631
Are you inviting me
to hop on?

10:45.714 --> 10:48.464
(scoffs) I'm inviting you
to hop on and chip in.

10:48.547 --> 10:50.881
-What?
-Well, you know,

10:50.964 --> 10:53.130
you're coming on the plane,
you gotta chip in.

10:53.214 --> 10:54.506
Well, you're
already going, right?

10:54.589 --> 10:56.130
People resent you
if you don't chip in.

10:56.214 --> 10:57.964
-I don't think so.
-No, no, I will
a little bit, yeah.

10:58.047 --> 10:59.964
-I mean, you're loaded.
-There's the resentment,
right there.

11:00.047 --> 11:02.339
Okay, fine. Yes.
I will chip in.

11:02.422 --> 11:05.130
-Ted coming?
-No, he can't come.

11:05.214 --> 11:07.756
-Aah, shoot.
-Cheryl: He's doing
another movie.

11:07.839 --> 11:10.089
-What is he doing?
-He's doing a comedy.
And, um...

11:10.172 --> 11:13.339
-He is so funny. I mean, nobody
can make me laugh like Ted.
-Cheryl: So funny.

11:13.422 --> 11:16.005
-His timing is just like--
-He's just hilarious.
I know, perfect.

11:16.089 --> 11:18.381
By the way,
it might interest
you to know

11:18.464 --> 11:20.839
that I'll be
bringing a date.

11:20.923 --> 11:23.047
-What's her name?
-Her name is Donna.

11:23.130 --> 11:24.589
-Susie/Cheryl: Donna.
-Yeah.

11:24.673 --> 11:26.923
-Lovely, lovely woman.
-How many dates
have you had?

11:27.005 --> 11:29.047
-We've had one date.
-One date?

11:29.130 --> 11:30.839
-Yeah.
-And you're bringing her
on a trip?

11:30.923 --> 11:32.005
-Yes, I am.
-Okay.

11:32.089 --> 11:33.214
And you're complaining

11:33.297 --> 11:35.005
that divorced couples
shouldn't come

11:35.089 --> 11:37.005
when you're bringing
a virtual stranger?

11:37.089 --> 11:38.255
We get along quite well.

11:38.339 --> 11:39.839
All right.
I can't wait to meet her.

11:39.923 --> 11:40.798
Jeff:
Oh, boy.

11:40.881 --> 11:42.047
I need your weights,
by the way.

11:42.130 --> 11:43.506
-Susie: What do you mean?
-For the plane.

11:43.589 --> 11:45.506
-You fucking kidding me?
-No, I'm not kidding you.

11:45.589 --> 11:46.881
-It's a safety issue.
-I'm not giving you the weight.

11:46.964 --> 11:48.506
Larry:
This is a regulation.

11:48.589 --> 11:50.673
-This is a--
-Ask Jeff if he'll give you
his weight.

11:50.756 --> 11:51.839
You're not gonna
give me your weight?

11:51.923 --> 11:53.839
She doesn't even know
how much I weigh.

11:53.923 --> 11:55.673
-Yeah.
-You know who else
doesn't know

11:55.756 --> 11:57.255
how much I weigh?
My doctor.

11:57.339 --> 11:58.714
My weight?

11:58.798 --> 12:00.756
My business.
No one knows.

12:00.839 --> 12:02.339
-Yeah, it's very personal.
-Susie: Mm-hmm.

12:02.422 --> 12:05.047
I'd rather be dead
in the Sea of Cortez

12:05.130 --> 12:07.047
than have you
know what I weigh.

12:07.130 --> 12:10.214
I don't want your weights.
The captain wants them.
Who's gonna disobey a captain?

12:10.297 --> 12:12.964
-You mean, uh, the pilot.
-No, I mean the captain.

12:13.047 --> 12:14.673
No, the captain's for a boat.

12:14.756 --> 12:16.506
-He's the pilot.
-Well, he is a pilot...

12:16.589 --> 12:19.130
-It's not a boat.
-...but he wants to be
referred to as the captain.

12:19.214 --> 12:22.214
-He's told you,
"Please call me the captain."
-That's on his card!

12:22.297 --> 12:24.631
-Captain Garvin, okay?
-He's a pilot.

12:24.714 --> 12:26.089
How do you wanna be
referred to?

12:26.172 --> 12:27.422
-Jeff.
-Okay.

12:27.506 --> 12:28.839
If you said to me,
"From now on,

12:28.923 --> 12:30.547
I want to be referred to
as Goat Williker,"

12:30.631 --> 12:32.756
-I would call you
Goat Williker.
-Jeff: Fine.

12:32.839 --> 12:35.005
-Call me Goat Williker.
-Fine, Goat Williker.

12:35.089 --> 12:36.464
The pilot wants your weight.

12:36.547 --> 12:38.297
You can tell the pilot
that Goat Williker

12:38.381 --> 12:39.714
doesn't give his weight
to anyone.

12:39.798 --> 12:42.214
That's right.
And neither does
Mrs. Williker.

12:42.297 --> 12:45.339
Jeff:
The Willikers
do not give their weight.

12:46.881 --> 12:51.506
(engine roaring)

13:03.214 --> 13:05.339
-Want some?
-Nah. I'm good.

13:05.422 --> 13:07.172
-They're free. (chuckles)
-Yeah, just 'cause they're free

13:07.255 --> 13:09.422
doesn't mean
that we have to eat
everything that they have.

13:09.506 --> 13:11.172
Oh, my God.
You should see
everything they have.

13:11.255 --> 13:12.923
They'll be talking about us
when we leave.

13:13.005 --> 13:15.381
They'll say what pigs we are.
You know, we just
ate everything.

13:15.464 --> 13:18.631
Maybe they'll be talking about
how much we enjoyed their spread
they worked so hard to put out.

13:18.714 --> 13:21.964
Folks, sorry to, uh, interrupt.

13:22.047 --> 13:23.631
We're gonna have to make
an unscheduled landing.

13:23.714 --> 13:25.923
-Why? Something's wrong?
-Larry: What are you
talking about?

13:26.005 --> 13:28.839
Nothing's wrong with the plane.
We're just... heavy.

13:28.923 --> 13:31.381
-How come?
-Because of the weights.

13:31.464 --> 13:32.881
'Cause I asked you
for your weights,

13:32.964 --> 13:34.798
you wouldn't tell me,
so I had to guess your weights.

13:34.881 --> 13:36.422
And now, now we're over.

13:36.506 --> 13:38.631
-Why didn't you just ask me?
-What did you put down for me?

13:38.714 --> 13:40.881
It's none of your business
what I put down for you.

13:40.964 --> 13:43.631
-It is my business.
-(loud arguing)

13:43.714 --> 13:46.339
-What did you put down?
-I ain't tellin' you shit.

13:46.422 --> 13:48.964
Okay, folks.
It doesn't matter
how we got here.

13:49.047 --> 13:52.005
The fact of the matter is
that we're here now,
and we're overweight.

13:52.089 --> 13:54.714
-(bell chimes)
-We're beginning
our initial descent.

13:54.798 --> 13:56.547
Please fasten your seat belts.

13:56.631 --> 13:59.339
♪ ♪

14:00.673 --> 14:02.923
Susie:
Aah. Where the fuck are we?

14:03.005 --> 14:04.964
-Aqua Dulce.
-Where is that?

14:05.047 --> 14:07.631
All right. We are
100 pounds overweight,

14:07.714 --> 14:09.839
so we are going to have
to lose some bags.

14:09.923 --> 14:11.172
-Oh, come on.
-How many?

14:11.255 --> 14:12.839
At least two.
I-- Look.

14:12.923 --> 14:14.339
We don't have a lot of time,
so can you just

14:14.422 --> 14:15.839
figure out how
you want to do that?

14:15.923 --> 14:17.506
All right,
so, we'll, uh...

14:17.589 --> 14:19.089
-How do we decide?
-Whose bags?

14:19.172 --> 14:20.798
We'll, we'll shoot for it.

14:20.881 --> 14:24.089
-Whoever loses,
their bags stay.
-Larry: Right. Yes.

14:24.172 --> 14:26.005
-Donna: Oh, God.
-Let's split up
into couples, okay?

14:26.089 --> 14:27.506
-All right.
-And you will be
a couple with Leon.

14:27.589 --> 14:29.422
-Okay.
-Ready?
Once, twice, three...

14:29.506 --> 14:30.798
-Larry and Susie: Shoot!
-Cheryl: Oh.

14:30.881 --> 14:32.339
-Susie: Loser!
-Well, two out of three.

14:32.422 --> 14:34.339
-No. No fucking
two out of three.
-No, we just said

14:34.422 --> 14:36.923
-the odd man out.
-Aah, why'd I put two?
Two doesn't win.

14:37.005 --> 14:39.964
You don't get
a second chance, Larry.
It's not the damn playoffs.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.839
-Aah, shit.
-Go get your bags
and shut up.

14:41.964 --> 14:43.881
We gotta get going,
or we'll miss our slot
in Cabo.

14:43.964 --> 14:45.506
-Okay, yeah.
-Everybody back on the plane.

14:45.589 --> 14:47.214
-Please, please, please.
Get back on the plane.
-Oh, my God.

14:47.297 --> 14:48.547
-All right, okay.
-Thank you so much.

14:48.631 --> 14:50.214
That-- Yeah, that one,
and those two

14:50.297 --> 14:51.964
-big ones behind it.
-Pilot: Just move up the stairs.
Thank you.

14:52.047 --> 14:53.923
-All right. Thank you.
-(scoffs)

14:54.005 --> 14:56.172
Honestly, this is ridiculous.
Is this not ridiculous?

14:56.255 --> 14:58.339
You know, we paid
a lot of money for this plane.

14:58.422 --> 15:01.631
And I don't know why
you assholes couldn't
give me your weight!

15:01.714 --> 15:04.631
(slow mariachi ballad playing)

15:17.339 --> 15:19.339
Susie:
It's beautiful.
Oh, look at this!

15:19.422 --> 15:21.381
-(sighs) Huh?
-Susie: Gorgeous.

15:21.464 --> 15:22.756

gorgeous on you.

31:29.714 --> 31:33.089

It's elegant, stunning.

you could keep it.

-That is so sweet.

-Of course.
I'm generosity itself.
-I can't--

31:38.214 --> 31:39.881
-Oh, my God.
-Why would you do
something like that?

31:39.964 --> 31:42.214
-That's unbelievable.
-Because she's in need,
and I'm giving.

31:42.297 --> 31:45.214
-Excuse me for one minute.
-Susie: No more worries.

31:45.297 --> 31:46.339

Now, what's your
last name, sweetheart?

31:48.255 --> 31:52.214
-Uh, Mayer.
-Oh, of course.
Mayer. Yeah.

31:52.297 --> 31:55.130
-Hey. I need
your weight for the plane.
-Nah, fuck that.

31:55.214 --> 31:57.464
I don't give my weight,
or my fuckin' height.

31:57.547 --> 32:00.089
That's called a goddamn
description of a motherfucker.

32:00.172 --> 32:02.214
-So it is. So it is.
-Larry,

32:02.297 --> 32:03.714
you gotta try this coffee.

32:03.798 --> 32:06.089
It's the best fuckin' coffee
I ever had in my fuckin' life.

32:06.172 --> 32:07.964
-What?
-Mm!

32:08.047 --> 32:10.172
-Get a fuckin' cup.
-Really?

32:10.255 --> 32:13.381
Watch what the fuck happens
to your goddamn mouth
right now.

32:18.798 --> 32:20.381
Leon!

32:20.464 --> 32:22.422
Holy shit.
Leon, this is good!

32:22.506 --> 32:25.547
-You're fucking right, it is.
-This is better than
Mocha Joe's.

32:25.631 --> 32:27.547
Mocha Joe can't fuck
with this right here.

32:27.631 --> 32:30.255
-We gotta get these beans.
-You gotta get them
fuckin' beans, Larry.

32:30.339 --> 32:33.506
-Leon. I think
you did something.
-Leon: Ha-ha!

32:33.589 --> 32:34.881
Hey. Of course I fuckin' did.

32:34.964 --> 32:36.547
-I'm gonna go find out
about the beans.
-Yeah.

32:36.631 --> 32:39.297

Woo!

I've just come...

32:47.547 --> 32:50.255
to offer to you
my most sincere...

32:50.339 --> 32:51.839
and humble apology.

32:51.923 --> 32:55.255
Yes. I caused the stain.

32:55.339 --> 32:56.923
I should pay for it.

32:57.005 --> 32:58.130
You are 100% right.

32:58.214 --> 33:00.589
We appreciate that
you understand

33:00.673 --> 33:01.923
it was your fault.

33:02.005 --> 33:03.923
Although, let's face it.
I mean,

33:04.005 --> 33:06.547
you could have been
sports about it.
But, you know,

33:06.631 --> 33:08.798
-water under the bridge.
Whatever. Yeah.
-Of course, sir.

33:08.881 --> 33:12.255
-I just want to apologize.
-Oh. Of course.

33:13.089 --> 33:14.422
You know what.

33:14.506 --> 33:16.631
-I had a cup
of coffee earlier.
-Oh, yes.

33:16.714 --> 33:20.798
And I gotta say, it was
the most delicious cup of coffee
I've ever had in my life.

33:20.881 --> 33:22.506
-Thank you.
-It was fantastic.

33:22.589 --> 33:25.172
-I was just wondering
where you get those beans.
-Oh, yes.

33:25.255 --> 33:27.297
They are the hotel's
proprietary beans.

33:27.381 --> 33:30.464
They have been passed down
from generation to generation,

33:30.547 --> 33:34.130
and the family specifically
asked that we keep it
a secret.

33:34.214 --> 33:37.547
-Yeah, I'll,
I'll tell you why I ask.
-Mm-hmm.

33:37.631 --> 33:39.547
My poor sister is...

33:39.631 --> 33:42.089
she's quite ill.
She only has
a few months to live.

33:42.172 --> 33:45.422
And the only pleasure
in life that she gets at all is

33:45.506 --> 33:48.130
from her morning coffee.
I know that...

33:48.214 --> 33:50.297
this would add so much
to her life if...

33:50.381 --> 33:52.506
you could find it
in your heart to...

33:52.589 --> 33:55.506
to give me the name
of those beans.

33:55.589 --> 33:58.089
May I ask
what's wrong with her?

33:58.172 --> 34:00.881
Well, she had, uh,
Bell's palsy,

34:00.964 --> 34:02.839
and then it turned into...

34:02.923 --> 34:07.506
Rosenbaum's palsy,
which is quite lethal.

34:07.589 --> 34:09.631
-I'm not familiar
with either.
-Oh.

34:09.714 --> 34:11.297
-Is it bad?
-Yeah, it's terrible.

34:11.381 --> 34:13.214
You can't move
a muscle in her body.

34:13.297 --> 34:16.047
Ah. How can
she drink the coffee?

34:16.130 --> 34:20.714
All she can do,
really, is lift the cup up
to her lips and swallow.

34:20.798 --> 34:23.381
Literally that is
all she can do.

34:23.464 --> 34:25.214
-Pretty much.
-I see.

34:25.297 --> 34:27.547
I would like to extend
to you and your family

34:27.631 --> 34:30.714
my deepest, sincerest
regards for her.

34:30.798 --> 34:32.881
But we can't do anything
about the beans.

34:32.964 --> 34:35.881
You know what?
Bring her here.

34:35.964 --> 34:37.964
Like I just said,
she can't travel,
she can't move.

34:38.047 --> 34:40.381
She's incapacitated.
You gonna give me the name
of the beans or not?

34:40.464 --> 34:41.839
-I am not, sir.
-Great.

34:41.923 --> 34:43.589
I'm never coming back here again
for the rest of my life.

34:43.673 --> 34:45.047
-Got it?
-Got it.

34:45.130 --> 34:47.506
What's, what's the name
of that place for the clothes,
again?

34:47.589 --> 34:49.631
-Plaza de Manuel.
-Plaza de Manuel.

34:49.714 --> 34:51.214
-And the carnival?
-Same place.

34:51.297 --> 34:52.589

like a carnival game.

want to do it?
