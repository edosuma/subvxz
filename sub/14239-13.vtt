00:49.280 --> 00:51.319
You know it's rude to stare.

00:54.359 --> 00:57.119
I thought telepathy would get you
to make me a cuppa.

00:57.154 --> 00:59.639
What's it worth? What do you want?

01:01.200 --> 01:02.879
I'll draw you a diagram, shall I?

01:17.120 --> 01:18.160
Nice arse!

01:20.200 --> 01:22.280
MOBILE RINGS

01:23.319 --> 01:25.439
Don't answer it!

01:29.240 --> 01:32.484
Yep.
'You watching the news?'

01:32.519 --> 01:36.160
'There's speculation that the
incidents overnight may be linked.

01:36.195 --> 01:39.125
'Initial reports
suggested terrorist involvement'.

01:39.160 --> 01:43.520
'But some intelligence experts have
claimed the incidents may be stunts.

01:43.555 --> 01:49.079
'The first sightings were of UFOs
over the Taj Mahal in India.

01:49.114 --> 01:51.164
'They came in just after midnight.

01:51.199 --> 01:57.719
'In London this morning, men in
historic dress fired upon police.

01:59.720 --> 02:02.920
'Some religious groups
are claiming events overnight

02:02.955 --> 02:06.920
'are a vindication
of their teachings. '

02:06.955 --> 02:09.845
Do you think it is terrorists?

02:09.880 --> 02:12.740
Terrorists bomb things.
This is different.

02:12.775 --> 02:15.600
People didn't believe us.
Now they should.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.679
Judgment day is finally here.

02:17.714 --> 02:20.119
This is the End of Days.

02:32.200 --> 02:38.999
"And I heard but did not understand and I said, 'Master,
what is the End of all these things?' And he said,

02:39.034 --> 02:45.199
" 'Go, Daniel, for the things are closed up and
sealed until the end of time. ' " Daniel 12, verse 10.

02:45.234 --> 02:47.657
Sounds a bit close for comfort.

02:47.692 --> 02:50.080
This machine's on the blink.

02:50.115 --> 02:52.205
Keeps losing power.

02:52.240 --> 02:55.764
Sorry, don't let me stop
your portents of doom.

02:55.799 --> 02:59.084
Or have you finished? No.
More where that came from.

02:59.119 --> 03:02.679
Abaddon, the Great Devourer,
who'll lead the world into shadow.

03:02.714 --> 03:04.445
Thanks, lanto, no superstition.

03:04.480 --> 03:08.479
You people love any story that
denies the randomness of existence.

03:08.514 --> 03:12.479
Thanks. That makes me feel better.
OK, I've been fielding calls.

03:12.514 --> 03:14.245
The government, UNIT, the CIA...

03:14.280 --> 03:17.759
Half the world
are asking one question.

03:17.794 --> 03:21.239
Is this anything to do with us?
And is it?

03:22.240 --> 03:28.040
I've run a profile on every reported temporal
anomaly and tracked any physical or temporal pattern.

03:31.920 --> 03:36.119
Shit! The cracks in time
trace back here to the rift.

03:36.154 --> 03:39.645
This city, this Hub, is the centre.

03:39.680 --> 03:43.284
What you're seeing around the world
are ripples and aftershocks.

03:43.319 --> 03:49.239
The rift is splintering because of you. What?
You opened it without knowing what you were doing.

03:49.274 --> 03:53.320
You've caused the temporal cracks
to widen. Time is seeping through.

03:53.355 --> 03:56.439
If it wasn't for me, you two
would still be in the 1940s.

03:58.839 --> 04:03.440
So are we going to sit around crying into
our lattes, or shall we do something about it?

04:04.720 --> 04:09.079
Bring those who've fallen through
time back here, into the vaults.

04:09.114 --> 04:13.404
And do what with them? We'll deal
with phase one, then phase two.

04:13.439 --> 04:17.839
You can't control time. What are you
gonna do? We'll think of something!

04:23.440 --> 04:28.319
Hey, this is not
the end of the world.

04:31.279 --> 04:33.320
I'm certain of that.

04:37.799 --> 04:40.844
COMPUTER BEEPS

04:40.879 --> 04:45.719
Priority one attendance - hospital.
Mortality rate's through the roof.

04:45.754 --> 04:47.405
They're designating a hot zone.

04:47.440 --> 04:50.645
I'll go. Tosh, go with him.
No, thanks, I'm fine on my own.

04:50.680 --> 04:55.040
And you'll be even better with
me alongside. Shut up and come on.

04:57.199 --> 05:01.719
Did you have to pick on him in public like
that? All our actions have consequences.

05:01.754 --> 05:05.879
And all your staff have feelings,
Jack, even Owen. Well, you'd know.

05:10.480 --> 05:12.005
He brought you back.

05:12.040 --> 05:14.759
Would you rather be stuck
in World War II?

05:14.794 --> 05:16.284
Hello.

05:16.319 --> 05:19.805
'Gwen, it's Andy'.

05:19.840 --> 05:22.199
Listen,
I didn't know who else to call.

05:22.234 --> 05:24.439
MAN SHOUTS IN LATIN

05:24.474 --> 05:25.805
Double murder.

05:25.840 --> 05:29.004
Stabbed two blokes in Penarth.
Brutal, it was. No mercy.

05:29.039 --> 05:34.440
What are we supposed to do? He doesn't speak a word
of English, and he's dressed as a Roman soldier!

05:34.475 --> 05:38.600
He's not, he IS a Roman soldier
and he's shouting in Latin.

05:38.635 --> 05:41.399
Only word I could pick out
was Gelligaer.

05:41.434 --> 05:43.284
Gelligaer.

05:43.319 --> 05:47.165
There's a Roman fort out at
Gelligaer. Built around 75AD.

05:47.200 --> 05:51.200
He was on his way, time splintered,
he ends up here. Excuse me?

05:52.520 --> 05:55.359
Hi. Any time you feel
like talking sense...

05:55.394 --> 05:58.199
That soldier came through
a crack in time.

05:58.234 --> 06:00.005
He's not serious, is he?

06:00.040 --> 06:02.964
This sort of thing just
doesn't happen. Not in Cardiff.

06:02.999 --> 06:08.079
Just cos you can't understand, doesn't mean
it isn't true. I know it sounds mad, Andy...

06:08.114 --> 06:13.160
All right, Mulder and Scully. Say I do
believe you, which I don't, cos it's bollocks.

06:13.195 --> 06:16.965
How exactly are we meant to handle
a prisoner from 2,000 years ago?

06:17.000 --> 06:21.479
Has he got the same rights as anyone?
How's this gonna work with the CPS?

06:21.514 --> 06:23.399
We'll take him off your hands.

06:25.799 --> 06:28.919
HE SHOUTS IN LATIN

06:31.240 --> 06:36.640
Under any other circumstances, an exuberant Roman
soldier would be my idea of a perfect morning.

06:36.675 --> 06:37.680
Careful, Jack.

06:45.640 --> 06:49.040
PRISONER STOPS SHOUTING
Everyone's saying it, you know.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.924
In work, on the streets.

06:50.959 --> 06:53.719
Do you think
this is the end of the world?

06:53.754 --> 06:55.685
Oh, Andy, don't be silly.

06:55.720 --> 06:58.524
Do you think the world's gonna end
on your shift?

06:58.559 --> 07:04.404
I've seen you use that smile
on a lot of people. What smile?

07:04.439 --> 07:08.639
The smile you use to reassure people
when everything's gone to shit.

07:11.080 --> 07:15.400
This was the first one to die. NO ID on
her. She just appeared in the middle of A&E.

07:15.435 --> 07:18.520
Nobody saw her come in,
she didn't register at the desk.

07:18.555 --> 07:21.199
So what happened?
She started coughing up blood.

07:21.234 --> 07:23.124
We moved her into isolation.

07:23.159 --> 07:26.359
An hour later, the staff presented
similar symptoms.

07:28.280 --> 07:33.640
Which were? Bite-like bumps, chills, fever,
headaches, along with black patches on the skin.

07:33.675 --> 07:37.277
Indicating bleeding into the skin
and possibly other organs.

07:37.312 --> 07:40.879
From the staff, it spread to
patients who'd been in reception.

07:44.399 --> 07:49.760
These aren't contemporary clothes.
Her teeth aren't modern, either.

07:52.680 --> 07:53.645
Shit.

07:53.680 --> 07:57.479
As soon as we realised the rate
of infection, we closed down.

07:59.240 --> 08:01.439
How many others are infected?

08:01.474 --> 08:03.604
30, maybe 40.

08:03.639 --> 08:05.525
All quarantined off?

08:05.560 --> 08:08.560
We think so. Have their clothes
and sheets destroyed.

08:16.799 --> 08:21.640
What is it?
That woman isn't from this century.

08:21.675 --> 08:24.365
More like the 14th.

08:24.400 --> 08:27.799
It's the... it's the fucking...
Black Death, Tosh.

08:29.399 --> 08:32.519
She's infected Cardiff A&E
with the plague...

08:32.554 --> 08:35.205
and it's my fault.

08:35.240 --> 08:38.844
The team
are instigating procedures.

08:38.879 --> 08:44.440
The infected will need 30 milligrams of Streptomycin
and Chloramphenicol plus two of Tetracycline.

08:44.475 --> 08:47.977
That's plague medicine.
Standard issue for bubonic.

08:48.012 --> 08:51.479
Well done, House.
That's what you're up against.

08:51.514 --> 08:53.364
So what are you gonna do now?

08:53.399 --> 08:55.444
Well, you've got procedures,
haven't you?

08:55.479 --> 08:58.764
Yes, but everybody said Torchwood
would sort it out.

08:58.799 --> 09:03.639
What if we get more carriers appearing?
We're working to stop that. We waited for you!

09:03.674 --> 09:08.445
You've got to stop this! You've gotta do
something! No, you've gotta do something.

09:08.480 --> 09:14.440
People are dropping through time and they'll
bring every disease in history through your doors.

09:14.475 --> 09:16.520
So you'd better be ready. Owen...

09:16.555 --> 09:18.617
You scared enough yet?

09:18.652 --> 09:20.680
Cos fuck knows I am!

09:20.715 --> 09:22.524
Come on, Tosh!

09:22.559 --> 09:26.000
Make sure they get the medicine.
Call us if things get worse.

09:26.035 --> 09:28.520
How much worse can they get?

09:36.079 --> 09:38.039
Owen?

09:38.074 --> 09:40.000
Owen!

09:45.879 --> 09:48.044
Okasan?

09:48.079 --> 09:51.259
SHE SPEAKS IN JAPANESE

09:51.294 --> 09:54.440
TOSH REPLIES IN JAPANESE

10:09.119 --> 10:12.640
Tosh! Come on, stop pissing about.

10:20.759 --> 10:25.640
If Owen managed to open the rift to get you and Tosh
back, can't we do the same thing for these people?

10:25.675 --> 10:29.279
We've got the rift manipulator.
There's a world of difference.

10:29.314 --> 10:32.356
We're talking about
taking control of time,

10:32.391 --> 10:35.535
not bringing two people back
from the past.

10:35.570 --> 10:38.644
Besides,
look at the damage Owen caused.

10:38.679 --> 10:41.800
We mess with it further,
we'll put the planet in danger.

10:41.835 --> 10:44.360
Have I ever let you down?

10:49.519 --> 10:53.120
Gwen?

11:00.800 --> 11:02.759
'I'm sorry. '

11:04.799 --> 11:07.400
'I'm so sorry. '

11:09.559 --> 11:10.765
Gwen?

11:10.800 --> 11:14.679
Gwen! Come on.

11:14.714 --> 11:16.520
Hustle!

11:29.879 --> 11:32.364
Are you sure it was the same guy?

11:32.399 --> 11:36.019
It was definitely him. Bilis,
the caretaker of the dancehall.

11:36.054 --> 11:39.639
That's all he said, sorry?
What's he got to be sorry for?

11:39.674 --> 11:43.439
Coming through!
WEEVIL GROWLS

11:46.159 --> 11:50.004
13 more reports of Weevils.
We can't keep up at this rate.

11:50.039 --> 11:54.760
Everything's on the increase. Can you stop them
making that noise? If you've got any ideas how.

11:54.795 --> 11:57.285
Maybe they're time sensitive.
It's too much.

11:57.320 --> 12:00.244
We're now full in all vaults
across all nine levels.

12:00.279 --> 12:04.319
Do you want me to activate the vaults below?
We've never used them since I've been here.

12:04.354 --> 12:05.485
Do it.

12:05.520 --> 12:09.360
Gwen, maybe you're right. Let's run
a search on your dancehall buddy.

12:09.395 --> 12:13.719
We need to find him. OK.
WEEVIL MOANS

12:18.119 --> 12:20.600
Hello, lanto.

12:30.999 --> 12:33.920
What do you want? Why are you here?

12:33.955 --> 12:36.040
This isn't happening.

12:37.640 --> 12:41.240
There's only one way to stop this,
before things get worse.

12:41.275 --> 12:43.797
People will die, lanto.

12:43.832 --> 12:46.285
Thousands of people.

12:46.320 --> 12:48.920
Unless you open the rift.

13:05.120 --> 13:07.325
Owen. How was the hospital?

13:07.360 --> 13:11.440
Laugh a bloody minute. They've
got an outbreak of the Black Death.

13:11.475 --> 13:14.600
What? Oh, my God!
Have they got it under control?

13:15.839 --> 13:18.204
Tosh! How are they coping?

13:18.239 --> 13:23.159
Um, Owen got the place quarantined and organised
treatments for those who've been infected.

13:23.194 --> 13:25.605
Only consolation is,
it's treatable.

13:25.640 --> 13:29.565
But what happens when
the next carrier comes through, Jack?

13:29.600 --> 13:33.180
Someone carrying smallpox or Ebola,
or something from the future?

13:33.215 --> 13:36.725
What do we do then? Well, it's not
doing us any good speculating.

13:36.760 --> 13:42.519
We need to be prepared. We're helpless. We're
putting sticking plasters on gaping wounds!

13:42.554 --> 13:44.325
What do you suggest?

13:44.360 --> 13:48.279
I suggest you lead us and you
tell us what the instructions are.

13:48.314 --> 13:52.136
Owen... No, come on.
You're all thinking it too.

13:52.171 --> 13:55.924
You're the big man here.
You keep all the secrets.

13:55.959 --> 13:59.599
Well, now's the time to tell us
how the hell we'll get out of this!

14:01.559 --> 14:05.200
You want to know a secret?
There is no solution.

14:05.235 --> 14:07.044
I can't fix this.

14:07.079 --> 14:10.124
Because this was never
meant to happen.

14:10.159 --> 14:13.799
The first thing you learned
was don't mess with the rift.

14:13.834 --> 14:16.125
But you disobeyed those orders.

14:16.160 --> 14:18.884
And now everything that's happening
is down to you.

14:18.919 --> 14:24.160
I only disobeyed to get you back. And now
people are dying. So I shouldn't have bothered?

14:24.195 --> 14:26.920
Who the fuck are you, anyway?

14:26.955 --> 14:28.525
Jack Harkness?

14:28.560 --> 14:30.560
You don't even exist.

14:30.595 --> 14:31.685
We've looked.

14:31.720 --> 14:35.560
So if you're not even a real person,
then why should I follow your orders?

14:35.595 --> 14:38.964
Get out. What?

14:38.999 --> 14:41.525
Get out!
I'm relieving you of your duty.

14:41.560 --> 14:45.360
No. You can't do that!
Bollocks, you are! Jack, wait.

14:46.999 --> 14:49.120
You're done here.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.485
What, so that's it?

14:52.520 --> 14:56.340
The whole world is going to shit
and you're going to fire me?

14:56.375 --> 15:00.160
For God's sake! Both of you!
We need to stick together on this.

15:01.960 --> 15:06.760
If I can't rely on you, if I don't have
your complete trust, you don't belong here.

15:08.680 --> 15:10.484
That goes for the rest of you.

15:10.519 --> 15:14.160
Anyone who agrees with Owen,
leave now.

15:26.440 --> 15:28.960
So now we know how it is.

15:31.720 --> 15:35.480
So that leaves me 24 hours
to savour the good times.

15:35.515 --> 15:38.039
What are you talking about?

15:38.074 --> 15:40.485
Think about it, Gwen.

15:40.520 --> 15:42.684
Nobody leaves this place intact.

15:42.719 --> 15:48.200
Sometime in the next 24 hours...
I get Retconned.

15:50.120 --> 15:51.799
All my memories erased.

15:54.280 --> 15:58.600
I don't know where or when,
but he'll get me.

15:58.635 --> 16:00.320
Jack, this has gone far enough.

16:03.320 --> 16:05.640
So I guess this is goodbye.

16:08.840 --> 16:11.639
Good luck with the end of the world.

16:15.080 --> 16:20.120
I would say thanks for the
memories... Jack, for God's sake!

17:01.480 --> 17:04.919
'OK, guys, Bilis's shop is
coming up 20 metres on your left'.

17:14.720 --> 17:17.364
Wow.

17:17.398 --> 17:21.244
Some of this stuff
must go back centuries.

17:21.280 --> 17:26.398
He scavenges antique pieces from the past,
brings them here, sells them for a profit.

17:26.434 --> 17:28.244
Not a bad business plan.

17:28.280 --> 17:31.759
We all have to earn a living.

17:31.794 --> 17:34.044
You're from 1941.

17:34.079 --> 17:36.439
As you were. Hello, again.

17:40.319 --> 17:43.524
How can you be
in two time zones at once?

17:43.559 --> 17:48.285
I can step across eras,
like you'd walk into another room.

17:48.320 --> 17:53.559
At first, it was the most incredible
gift. Now I know the reality...

17:53.594 --> 17:55.840
it's a curse.

17:55.875 --> 17:58.445
Why?

17:58.480 --> 18:02.484
I can see the whole of history,

18:02.519 --> 18:05.320
but I don't belong anywhere
within it.

18:08.279 --> 18:11.720
So, your return to this time
had a price.

18:11.755 --> 18:14.405
Time's splintering.

18:14.440 --> 18:18.605
This city exists on a rift in time.

18:18.640 --> 18:22.240
The only way to make it right
is to fully open that rift -

18:22.275 --> 18:25.325
let it suck back what fell through.

18:25.360 --> 18:29.399
No way. It's too dangerous.
Can we even do that?

18:29.434 --> 18:31.124
Of course you can.

18:31.159 --> 18:32.880
Isn't that right, Captain?

18:36.559 --> 18:39.204
Jack? You've seen what happened.

18:39.239 --> 18:42.519
If we open that rift fully,
millions of lives will be at risk.

18:42.554 --> 18:45.679
And yet, if you don't,
more will fall through.

18:45.714 --> 18:48.240
Lives will be lost.

18:55.079 --> 18:58.639
You know so much, you're coming
back with us. I'm sorry.

19:01.519 --> 19:06.039
Damn it! Trace the temporal
activity around this location.

19:06.074 --> 19:08.000
We need to find out where he is.
Come on.

19:10.320 --> 19:13.200
CLOCKS CHIME

19:13.235 --> 19:14.879
Gwen.

19:22.519 --> 19:25.404
I am not your enemy.

19:25.439 --> 19:28.280
In the cells,
why did you say you were sorry?

19:29.320 --> 19:34.760
Sometimes it's better
to live in ignorance... unless...

19:36.839 --> 19:40.360
Do you really want to know?
Know what?

19:40.395 --> 19:43.240
Hold my hands. I'll show you.

19:43.275 --> 19:45.405
OK.

19:45.440 --> 19:48.599
Only if you're sure.

19:48.634 --> 19:50.279
I'm sure.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.005
I'm sorry!

20:10.040 --> 20:11.600
What did you just show me?

20:11.635 --> 20:13.280
The future.

20:20.040 --> 20:23.519
What took you so long? Gwen?

20:24.599 --> 20:26.200
Gwen!

20:35.480 --> 20:38.619
Is that you?

20:38.654 --> 20:41.724
Yeah... It's me.

20:41.759 --> 20:45.125
Ah! You're cleaning the oven!

20:45.160 --> 20:48.040
Aye, somebody got to, love.
Listen, we gotta go.

20:48.075 --> 20:50.244
Why, what's happened? We've gotta go.

20:50.279 --> 20:52.884
Let me finish here first...
Rhys, we've gotta go. Now!

20:52.919 --> 20:58.000
Aw, here we go again, always a hurry
since you started that bloody job...

20:59.999 --> 21:01.480
I'm sorry.

21:18.080 --> 21:19.759
Owen.

21:22.319 --> 21:24.319
Oh... Jesus.

21:24.354 --> 21:26.320
Diane...

21:28.720 --> 21:30.045
Oh, Jesus.

21:30.080 --> 21:31.799
I'm lost, Owen.

21:36.359 --> 21:39.799
I can touch you. I don't understand.

21:39.834 --> 21:42.365
Where did you end up? Please.

21:42.400 --> 21:47.399
Bring me back, Owen. You can
do that, can't you? I don't know.

21:48.919 --> 21:51.919
Everything's out of sync. Please.

21:53.480 --> 21:55.199
Please bring me back.

21:55.234 --> 21:57.239
Open the rift.

21:59.080 --> 22:02.440
Do you want another drink there,
mate?

22:02.475 --> 22:04.960
# Can it call you or maul you

22:04.995 --> 22:06.937
# And drive you insane

22:06.972 --> 22:08.880
# Can it make you remember

22:08.915 --> 22:11.717
# Time is in place

22:11.752 --> 22:14.519
# Now I'm begging you

22:15.560 --> 22:17.359
# I'm begging you... #

22:28.439 --> 22:33.000
Take it easy. What's going on?
Am I dreaming?

22:33.035 --> 22:35.964
This is where I work.

22:35.999 --> 22:39.760
You work in a prison?
These are just the cells.

22:42.160 --> 22:47.200
You locked me in a cell? What the hell are you
playing at? I was just trying to keep you safe.

22:47.235 --> 22:51.479
I was safe at home! No, you weren't.
You really weren't. Listen, Gwen,

22:51.514 --> 22:54.324
you'd better tell me
exactly what's going on

22:54.359 --> 22:57.524
cos I've taken some shit
over the past few months.

22:57.559 --> 23:01.439
What's all this? Rhys, listen to me,
I need you to trust me.

23:01.474 --> 23:05.897
OK, it may not seem like it
at the moment,

23:05.932 --> 23:10.320
but I'm just trying
to take care of you.

23:10.355 --> 23:12.564
I love you, sweetheart.

23:12.599 --> 23:16.679
LOUD MOAN FROM ABOVE
What the hell was that?

23:16.714 --> 23:20.724
Just try and relax
and I'll come back for you.

23:20.759 --> 23:27.839
What do you mean? You're not going to leave
me down here! I'm sorry. Gwen! Gwen! I'm sorry.

23:27.874 --> 23:29.759
Shit!

23:38.399 --> 23:41.524
Did he wake up? Yeah. Yeah, he did.

23:41.559 --> 23:44.884
Tosh, can you bring up the CCTV
of the vaults?

23:44.919 --> 23:48.599
Er, just leave it on the screen,
I know it sounds crazy, but...

23:48.634 --> 23:52.280
Sure, no problem. Thank you...
for helping me bring him here.

23:54.199 --> 23:58.199
I can't understand how Bilis
was able to show you that vision.

24:01.559 --> 24:03.579
It was so real, Tosh.

24:03.614 --> 24:05.565
I was in my flat.

24:05.600 --> 24:09.805
It smelt like my flat,
it had all the sounds of my flat.

24:09.840 --> 24:14.440
I touched the blood. I can still
feel it on my hands. Rhys's blood.

24:16.040 --> 24:18.000
Not gonna happen.

24:24.279 --> 24:26.760
Come on,
there's still work to be done.

24:33.199 --> 24:36.239
What's going on?
We've got a security breach.

24:38.359 --> 24:41.599
All right, nobody panic.

24:41.634 --> 24:43.559
RHYS!

24:56.000 --> 24:58.999
KLAXON SOUNDS

25:13.359 --> 25:15.919
Oh, do you work here?

25:19.319 --> 25:20.759
I'm Rhys...

25:22.520 --> 25:24.520
.. Gwen's boyfriend.

25:24.555 --> 25:26.759
RHYS GROANS

26:14.720 --> 26:16.020
NO!

26:16.055 --> 26:17.320
No!

26:18.359 --> 26:21.560
He's gone! He's gone! Please...

26:21.595 --> 26:23.039
No! Please!

26:24.959 --> 26:27.684
No!

26:27.719 --> 26:31.044
We can... we can bring him back!

26:31.079 --> 26:34.799
There's nothing we can do.
Yes, there is! My boy.

26:34.834 --> 26:38.519
What am I going to do?
What am I going to do?

26:38.554 --> 26:43.120
SHE SCREAMS
No!

26:43.155 --> 26:45.325
No!

26:45.360 --> 26:47.840
GWEN'S SCREAMS ECHO

27:11.920 --> 27:14.204
I'll have to tell his family.

27:14.239 --> 27:20.240
We'll deal with it. The way you dealt
with that porter the first time I met you?

27:21.960 --> 27:26.920
No, you won't deal with him, lanto.

27:29.120 --> 27:33.199
Gwen, I'm so sorry.

27:40.080 --> 27:42.560
You never even met him.

27:46.800 --> 27:49.200
This is what happens here.

27:51.799 --> 27:53.520
We all end up alone.

27:58.480 --> 27:59.959
Not me.

28:01.480 --> 28:04.084
No way.

28:04.119 --> 28:08.279
You bring him back. No.
The resurrection gauntlet...

28:08.314 --> 28:11.484
Was destroyed. Something else.
I said no.

28:11.519 --> 28:16.599
No, there's something wrong with time, so we, we
can go back to the moment, to the very moment...

28:16.634 --> 28:22.520
Gwen... There's something you can do,
otherwise WHAT'S THE FUCKING POINT OF YOU?!

28:22.555 --> 28:25.079
You, you bring him back!

28:25.114 --> 28:27.037
Bring him back!

28:27.072 --> 28:28.925
You bring him back!

28:28.960 --> 28:32.200
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME,
JACK FUCKING HARKNESS?

28:32.235 --> 28:35.159
I'm sorry. Do you? I'm so sorry.

28:35.194 --> 28:37.480
I'm sorry.

28:47.240 --> 28:49.719
Oh, shit.

28:51.680 --> 28:54.684
What happened?

28:54.719 --> 28:58.559
You came back! Are you all right?
You OK? You all right?

28:58.594 --> 29:01.120
Don't touch me!

29:08.200 --> 29:10.760
How many other people
have got to suffer?

29:17.840 --> 29:19.400
I'm gonna fix this.

29:20.999 --> 29:22.480
I'm opening the rift.

29:26.359 --> 29:27.919
Make sure you stop him.

29:31.120 --> 29:32.120
No.

29:35.720 --> 29:37.000
We're gonna help him.

29:39.880 --> 29:44.439
Bilis was right, he said open the rift
and everything goes back to normal.

29:44.474 --> 29:46.005
Owen's right.

29:46.040 --> 29:49.120
I'm going to get Rhys back.

29:49.155 --> 29:51.365
Gwen. No! Gwen!

29:51.400 --> 29:54.520
Enter Emergency Protocol One.

29:55.600 --> 29:59.480
Out the way, I'll do this.
ALARM SOUNDS

30:05.280 --> 30:09.940
Get away from the computer,
Gwen. Jack... This is a trap.

30:09.975 --> 30:14.600
All the cracks, they're diversions.
This is what Bilis wants.

30:14.635 --> 30:16.119
What are you afraid of, Jack?

30:19.160 --> 30:20.560
Rhea Silva.

30:22.120 --> 30:25.239
I said, "Move. "

30:26.519 --> 30:29.639
What the hell are you doing?!
Final warning.

30:33.920 --> 30:37.320
Come on, Jack.
You're a united front now?

30:40.799 --> 30:46.040
Toshiko, the poor girl who'll screw any
passing alien that gives her a pendant?

30:46.075 --> 30:51.359
Owen, so strong, he gets in a cage
with a Weevil, desperate to be mauled.

30:51.394 --> 30:54.684
Or lanto, hiding his
cyber-girlfriend in the basement.

30:54.719 --> 30:58.240
Your three comrades here
pumped bullets into her, remember?

30:58.275 --> 31:00.204
I've got to get Rhys back.

31:00.239 --> 31:04.840
Yeah, cos you're so in love with Rhys that
you spend half your time in Owen's bed.

31:06.880 --> 31:10.559
Fuck you! We're relieving you
of your command, "Captain".

31:10.594 --> 31:13.160
We're getting back what we lost!

31:19.360 --> 31:20.604
Shit!

31:20.639 --> 31:21.920
Stay down!

31:23.280 --> 31:27.880
You're in charge, Owen? You've gotta
have significantly bigger balls.

31:39.120 --> 31:42.440
I'm sick of people doubting me.

31:43.479 --> 31:45.760
What have you done?

32:07.440 --> 32:09.440
We've still got to do Jack's.

32:37.720 --> 32:39.959
KLAXON BLARES

Oh, my God!

32:55.999 --> 32:57.959
What have you done?

33:19.759 --> 33:21.280
Help me move him!

33:53.399 --> 33:56.559
Keep moving!
It's going to be all right, Jack.

33:56.594 --> 33:58.760
Everything is going to go
back to normal.

34:08.559 --> 34:12.199
From out of the darkness,
he is come.

34:12.235 --> 34:14.565
What is he talking about?

34:14.600 --> 34:19.520
Son of the Great Beast,
cast out before time,

34:19.554 --> 34:24.440
chained in rock
and imprisoned beneath the rift.

34:24.475 --> 34:26.199
What?!

34:28.760 --> 34:32.139
All hail Abaddon,

34:32.174 --> 34:35.484
the Great Devourer.

34:35.518 --> 34:39.560
Come to feast on life.
BEAST ROARS

35:28.160 --> 35:33.719
I look upon you, my God,
and know my work is done.

35:48.440 --> 35:51.159
How do we stop it?
Tell me what to do, Jack.

35:54.480 --> 35:58.760
Just you...
Get me to an open space.

36:11.759 --> 36:13.764
What are you gonna do?

36:13.799 --> 36:17.604
If Abaddon is the bringer of death,
let's see how he does with me.

36:17.639 --> 36:22.840
If he feeds on life, then I'm an all-you-can-eat
buffet. No, wait! Wait, you're too weak!

36:25.559 --> 36:28.199
Get out of here!

36:28.234 --> 36:29.279
GO!

36:31.959 --> 36:35.240
Drive as fast as you can. Jack!

36:35.275 --> 36:36.999
Bring it on!

GWEN SOBS

38:19.759 --> 38:23.999
You're here! Weren't you just
here a minute ago? You're here!

38:30.080 --> 38:35.599
Go to bed. Get some sleep...
and I'll be back for you.

38:50.640 --> 38:52.720
You're certain?

38:54.920 --> 38:57.380
He's ice cold.

38:57.415 --> 38:59.805
No vital signs.

38:59.840 --> 39:03.040
He survived when you shot him.

39:05.200 --> 39:07.679
When I first joined,
he said he couldn't die.

39:09.239 --> 39:10.725
He was wrong.

39:10.760 --> 39:13.400
I want to sit with him.

39:13.435 --> 39:14.885
Gwen...

39:14.920 --> 39:16.960
I want to sit with him.

40:20.639 --> 40:22.520
How long's she gonna do this?

41:04.759 --> 41:06.480
It's been days.

41:10.159 --> 41:12.699
We have to face up to it.

41:12.734 --> 41:15.426
He's not coming back.

41:15.461 --> 41:18.070
I believe in him.

41:18.105 --> 41:20.680
Let him go, Gwen.

42:05.519 --> 42:07.000
Thank you.

43:11.399 --> 43:13.879
I... I forgive you.

43:17.120 --> 43:19.600
OWEN SOBS

43:39.959 --> 43:42.440
What's happened to the rift?

43:43.520 --> 43:46.100
It closed up
when Abaddon was destroyed.

43:46.135 --> 43:48.680
But it's gonna be
more volatile than ever.

43:48.715 --> 43:50.800
The visions we had.

43:52.360 --> 43:54.560
We all saw people we loved.

43:56.080 --> 43:58.320
What did you see?

44:02.320 --> 44:03.799
Nothing.

44:07.679 --> 44:09.399
There was nothing.

44:12.279 --> 44:15.204
Jack...

44:15.239 --> 44:16.884
what would have tempted you?

44:16.919 --> 44:20.600
What visions would have
convinced you to open the rift?

44:21.640 --> 44:23.760
The right kind of Doctor.

44:26.440 --> 44:27.880
Jack...?

44:30.039 --> 44:31.840
Where are they with those coffees?
