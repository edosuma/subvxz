00:01.173 --> 00:02.381
<i>A brutal heat wave...</i>

00:02.381 --> 00:04.452
Barely 7:00, and it's already--

00:04.452 --> 00:06.696
<i>...breaking all records.
The extreme temperatures...</i>

00:06.696 --> 00:07.731
What are you wearing?

00:10.010 --> 00:12.046
A rechargeable cooling vest.

00:12.046 --> 00:15.325
Kevin says it's going to be
109 degrees today,

00:15.325 --> 00:19.019
and this will maintain
my core temperature
for up to eight hours.

00:19.019 --> 00:21.883
I also have a neck fan,

00:21.883 --> 00:25.025
personal hydration pack, and...

00:27.820 --> 00:28.856
...cooling hoodie.

00:30.513 --> 00:32.998
You, uh, really went for it.

00:32.998 --> 00:35.138
It's an investment
in our future.

00:35.138 --> 00:37.830
We will need these
many, many more times.

00:37.830 --> 00:38.900
Mm.

00:38.900 --> 00:40.488
<i>...to keep all pets indoors,</i>

00:40.488 --> 00:42.318
<i>and make sure
they have plenty of water.</i>

00:42.318 --> 00:43.526
If you need to...

00:45.079 --> 00:46.839
you can borrow my hoodie.

00:46.839 --> 00:48.255
<i>...stay hydrated,</i>

00:48.255 --> 00:51.603
<i>especially if you're elderly
or have special needs.</i>

00:51.603 --> 00:55.158
<i>During this high heat advisory,
please, please stay inside.</i>

01:01.889 --> 01:03.615
Out of the frying pan,
into the fire.

01:04.512 --> 01:06.859
Seriously.

01:06.859 --> 01:08.827
Is the AC even on?

01:08.827 --> 01:10.587
It's working fine
at the VA gym.

01:10.587 --> 01:13.901
My wheelchair
basketball team's taking refuge
over there later today.

01:13.901 --> 01:16.352
We could use a shooting guard.

01:16.352 --> 01:20.010
Not sure I'm quite ready
to drain threes in this thing.

01:20.010 --> 01:21.564
An iced cap, though.

01:24.118 --> 01:26.810
You're with me today,
Dr. Powell.

01:27.397 --> 01:28.778
Sweet.

01:28.778 --> 01:30.193
Do I get matching gear?

01:30.193 --> 01:33.127
Like a Team Murphy uniform?

01:33.127 --> 01:34.266
No.

01:38.028 --> 01:40.824
Spinal cord injuries disrupt
autonomic homeostasis,

01:40.824 --> 01:42.654
so patients are more
susceptible to the heat.

01:43.655 --> 01:46.244
If she'd had the surgery
I proposed,

01:46.244 --> 01:50.110
Dr. Lim would be better able
to regulate that temperature.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.457
- It was too early for her
to make that decision.
- No.

01:52.457 --> 01:56.495
The longer she waits,
the higher her risk
of irreversible edema.

01:57.876 --> 02:00.430
There's many factors
to consider.

02:00.430 --> 02:02.087
That's why I told her
not to rush into it.

02:02.846 --> 02:04.607
Excuse me.

02:04.607 --> 02:08.335
Y-You are
a first-year resident.

02:08.335 --> 02:11.821
I have much more
surgical experience than you.

02:11.821 --> 02:15.238
And I have much more
physical disability experience
than you.

02:19.277 --> 02:21.002
It's the ER.

02:27.802 --> 02:29.356
Blackout hit
a senior residence.

02:29.356 --> 02:32.255
Their entire population
has been evacuated to us.

02:32.255 --> 02:34.913
That makes 32 new patients.

02:34.913 --> 02:36.328
And one cake.

02:37.812 --> 02:39.952
Blackout shmackout.

02:39.952 --> 02:43.197
We gotta celebrate Art's 100th.

02:55.382 --> 02:56.728
Evaluate them all
for heat stroke.

02:56.728 --> 02:59.731
Also,
any pre-existing condition
could be exacerbated.

02:59.731 --> 03:02.320
The rest are yours.
All of them non-surgical.

03:02.320 --> 03:04.494
Some will need IVs
and cooling blankets.

03:06.669 --> 03:08.015
And wander bracelets.

03:11.225 --> 03:13.986
You want Fred and Ginger
or Stanley Kowalski?

03:15.091 --> 03:17.162
Your heart's running fast,
Mrs. Hamilton.

03:18.336 --> 03:20.027
The heat's
made your V-tach worse.

03:20.027 --> 03:22.788
My heart's
kept me going 90 years,

03:22.788 --> 03:24.549
so don't be too hard on it.

03:24.549 --> 03:26.033
And call me Edna.

03:26.033 --> 03:28.242
Ninety? Come on.
I don't buy it.

03:29.554 --> 03:32.384
You remind me
of Jerry at the home.

03:34.421 --> 03:37.113
Although you're
easier on the eyes.

03:39.805 --> 03:41.566
Let's give Edna
five of metoprolol.

03:45.880 --> 03:47.813
Lost her pulse.
Need a defibrillator.

03:58.652 --> 03:59.929
Got her pulse back.

04:06.936 --> 04:08.869
Nice work, Doc.

04:08.869 --> 04:10.733
Other than cracking her ribs.

04:10.733 --> 04:13.253
We better get a chest CT,
see how bad the damage is.

04:18.396 --> 04:19.431
You're not old.

04:21.882 --> 04:23.642
This is Brooks Mosey, 41.

04:23.642 --> 04:26.369
He collapsed during
his daily 60-mile bike ride.

04:26.369 --> 04:27.612
Yeah, the heat
caught me off-guard.

04:27.612 --> 04:28.751
I'm just dehydrated.

04:28.751 --> 04:30.718
You should watch
The Weather Channel.

04:30.718 --> 04:31.892
Start an IV.

04:36.068 --> 04:38.070
Oh. We need to start
an IO line.

04:38.070 --> 04:39.313
I can't find a good vein.

04:39.313 --> 04:42.489
That's because you didn't
tap the vein to make it dilate.

04:42.489 --> 04:44.456
He's dehydrated.
He needs an IO line.

04:44.456 --> 04:47.217
No, he needs a doctor
with more experience.

04:47.217 --> 04:50.669
Please change
that patient's catheter bag.

05:00.127 --> 05:02.474
Her core temp's 106.
She's critical.

05:02.474 --> 05:05.581
Axilla's packed.
Two cooling blankets.
None of it's helping.

05:05.581 --> 05:07.099
BP's tanking.

05:07.962 --> 05:09.481
This heat's frying her organs.

05:09.481 --> 05:11.518
That's the smoke detector.

05:11.518 --> 05:13.105
You leave the stove on, Marty?

05:13.105 --> 05:15.315
She needs cold
nasogastric lavage.

05:17.662 --> 05:18.973
I'm scared, Marty.

05:20.527 --> 05:22.598
May, my name is Dr. Perez.

05:22.598 --> 05:23.668
You're at a hospital.

05:23.668 --> 05:25.152
We're gonna take
good care of you.

05:28.397 --> 05:30.537
We've got you.

05:34.506 --> 05:35.611
Ah.

05:36.819 --> 05:38.890
<i>Gracias, senorita.</i>

05:39.994 --> 05:42.342
Oh, it's, uh, Tango Tuesday.

05:42.342 --> 05:44.965
We do all things Argentinian.

05:45.897 --> 05:46.898
That explains...

05:47.864 --> 05:51.799
That guy takes
three dance lessons,

05:51.799 --> 05:53.767
and she's all over him.

05:53.767 --> 05:54.837
Mm.

05:56.908 --> 05:58.288
Fred and Ginger?

05:58.288 --> 06:00.567
Every bit as adorable
as they look.

06:00.567 --> 06:02.258
Like two dancing prunes.

06:03.052 --> 06:04.536
A couple
in their twilight years

06:04.536 --> 06:06.158
displaying affection
makes you pissy?

06:07.367 --> 06:08.368
It's Tinder, isn't it?

06:09.576 --> 06:10.542
I saw your profile.

06:11.716 --> 06:12.717
What are you doing on Tinder?

06:13.373 --> 06:14.477
Spying on my coworkers.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.379
I don't blame you
for being cranky.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.587
There's nothing more depressing

06:20.587 --> 06:22.243
than a few laps
around the dating pool.

06:22.865 --> 06:24.038
<i>Amor.</i>

06:28.698 --> 06:29.699
Arthur Abbott?

06:31.252 --> 06:33.116
Art?

06:33.116 --> 06:35.084
Okay, well, he couldn't have
gotten far. He's--

06:35.084 --> 06:38.777
Hundred years old, as of today.

06:38.777 --> 06:42.540
Oh, Art's one spry
son of a bitch.

06:50.755 --> 06:52.688
I hear you saved my life today.

06:52.688 --> 06:54.552
And fractured some ribs
in the process.

06:54.552 --> 06:56.036
Mm.

06:56.036 --> 06:58.521
Which led to us doing a CT
that showed a tumor

06:58.521 --> 07:01.869
running from your right lung
to your belly.

07:04.493 --> 07:05.528
Can you remove it?

07:06.322 --> 07:08.255
Yes, but at your age,

07:08.255 --> 07:10.395
I'm not sure your body could
handle such a big surgery.

07:11.223 --> 07:12.604
I'd recommend you leave it.

07:14.468 --> 07:15.952
You'd have several good months.

07:16.712 --> 07:17.782
Months?

07:17.782 --> 07:20.129
Six, maybe seven.

07:23.477 --> 07:25.479
You saved my life once today.

07:25.479 --> 07:27.308
I'm sure you can do it again.

07:28.758 --> 07:31.278
Edna, I'm just not comfortable
doing the surgery.

07:33.038 --> 07:35.006
Then I want another opinion.

07:35.006 --> 07:36.559
And another
butterscotch pudding.

07:36.559 --> 07:39.044
Hmm? If it's not
too much trouble.

07:45.465 --> 07:46.983
Hmm.

07:51.678 --> 07:53.507
Dr. Powell's
not your favorite employee?

07:53.507 --> 07:55.854
We are not allowed
to have favorites,

07:55.854 --> 07:58.408
but if we were,

07:58.408 --> 07:59.789
she would not be mine.

07:59.789 --> 08:02.171
She is very annoying.

08:02.171 --> 08:05.381
I've got 68 employees,
seven of whom are annoying,

08:05.381 --> 08:08.557
and of those seven,
four are my best employees.

08:08.557 --> 08:11.491
They consistently challenge me
with opposing points of view.

08:12.284 --> 08:13.285
Hmm.

08:16.979 --> 08:18.774
I can't br-breathe.

08:18.774 --> 08:20.085
Aah!

08:20.085 --> 08:21.708
Code Blue!

08:21.708 --> 08:22.985
- Oh!
- Heart rate is 32!

08:22.985 --> 08:24.124
I need a crash cart!

08:30.993 --> 08:33.858
It's a structural issue
causing cardiac ischemia.

08:34.721 --> 08:36.170
Then we would've
heard a murmur.

08:36.170 --> 08:38.725
- What about
a coronary vasospasm?
- N-No.

08:38.725 --> 08:41.141
Brooks' troponins
are only mildly elevated.

08:41.141 --> 08:42.176
Hi, Lea.

08:45.076 --> 08:47.388
His electrolytes were off.

08:47.388 --> 08:49.356
Could've been
a vasovagal response
to dehydration.

08:49.356 --> 08:50.495
You're wrong.

08:50.495 --> 08:52.842
And your opposing
points of view are not useful.

08:52.842 --> 08:54.844
It is structural.

08:54.844 --> 08:57.329
We came here
because it's 10 degrees cooler
than everywhere else.

08:57.329 --> 09:00.367
Dr. Powell did not come to work
prepared for the heat.

09:01.713 --> 09:03.715
Go set up a coronary angio.

09:14.139 --> 09:18.005
It's 108 out here.
Why would Art leave
the hospital?

09:18.005 --> 09:19.731
It's called dementia.

09:19.731 --> 09:22.941
Spry or not, he couldn't have
hobbled this far.

09:22.941 --> 09:25.288
Put a wander bracelet on him
like Andrews told you to,

09:25.288 --> 09:27.049
we wouldn't be on this hunt
for the Walking Dead.

09:27.049 --> 09:29.465
Andrews was looking at you,
not me.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.055
Should we talk about
what's really bothering you?

09:34.781 --> 09:37.853
You look on over there
for the old guy you lost,
and I'll look over here.

09:42.996 --> 09:45.412
It's up to 77 degrees in here.

09:45.412 --> 09:47.897
Anything over 82
will compromise the servers.

09:51.418 --> 09:52.695
What's with Mr. Grumpy?

09:56.285 --> 09:58.252
I'm not Mr. Grumpy.

09:58.252 --> 10:00.979
Mm. You were with Powell.

10:02.636 --> 10:05.156
I don't like her.

10:05.156 --> 10:07.917
'Cause she's a bad resident?

10:07.917 --> 10:11.611
She... makes a lot of mistakes,

10:11.611 --> 10:13.578
but no more than the others.

10:13.578 --> 10:14.890
So it's her personality?

10:16.995 --> 10:18.272
She's annoying.

10:18.272 --> 10:20.171
- How is she annoying?
- She's...

10:23.243 --> 10:24.658
contrary.

10:24.658 --> 10:28.282
Oh. Kind of sounds like
someone we know?

10:28.282 --> 10:31.596
Yes. But I like Morgan.

10:34.219 --> 10:38.499
The first step to getting
past your issues with her
is identifying them.

10:38.499 --> 10:41.123
And why do I need
to get past my issues?

10:43.677 --> 10:45.610
And there's the blackout.

10:47.094 --> 10:48.130
Oh.

10:49.269 --> 10:50.788
That didn't last long.

10:50.788 --> 10:52.962
That's just the backup
generators kicking in.

10:52.962 --> 10:56.034
And how long they will last,
I have no idea.

10:58.692 --> 11:00.280
We got your labs
and imaging back.

11:01.626 --> 11:04.215
Heat has caused damage
to your heart and lungs.

11:06.044 --> 11:07.045
It's permanent.

11:09.738 --> 11:10.808
And, um...

11:15.295 --> 11:17.193
You're dying, May.

11:19.195 --> 11:20.541
Very soon.

11:21.335 --> 11:22.474
A matter of hours.

11:27.203 --> 11:30.862
But we'll make sure
you're not in any pain
and keep you comfortable.

11:32.899 --> 11:35.142
Do you have any family
we can call?

11:37.835 --> 11:38.801
No.

11:39.733 --> 11:41.562
My husband passed last year.

11:42.529 --> 11:43.530
Didn't he?

11:48.017 --> 11:49.985
Is there anyone you want
to be here with you?

11:54.714 --> 11:56.888
Marty was always
the social one.

11:59.857 --> 12:01.755
We talked about
seeing the world.

12:03.723 --> 12:07.830
Marty and I finally
booked a-a trip

12:07.830 --> 12:10.591
to celebrate
our 60th wedding anniversary.

12:12.214 --> 12:13.284
To Paris.

12:15.562 --> 12:16.943
But he got cancer.

12:19.083 --> 12:23.294
He still wanted to go,
but... I said no,

12:24.433 --> 12:26.746
we needed
to get him better first.

12:45.557 --> 12:47.145
Hi, Edna.

12:47.145 --> 12:49.561
I'm Dr. Aaron Glassman.

12:49.561 --> 12:52.323
I understand you wanted
a second set of eyes.

12:52.323 --> 12:54.394
Thank you for coming
so quickly.

12:54.394 --> 12:55.775
Well, I was
in the neighborhood.

12:56.879 --> 12:58.122
How you handling the heat?

12:59.433 --> 13:01.642
Well, I brought you this.

13:01.642 --> 13:03.299
In case
you want to use it later.

13:05.681 --> 13:07.441
Any shortness of breath?

13:07.441 --> 13:10.341
I've had that for ages.
It doesn't really bother me.

13:11.445 --> 13:13.137
At the home,
everything's right there.

13:14.207 --> 13:15.415
Well, that's convenient.

13:15.415 --> 13:16.450
It is.

13:17.658 --> 13:20.109
I do like to go
to the courtyard.

13:20.109 --> 13:22.491
They have a beautiful
eucalyptus tree there.

13:24.389 --> 13:27.496
When my granddaughter visited
from Eugene last summer,

13:27.496 --> 13:31.845
we sat out there
and just watched
the leaves rustle.

13:33.467 --> 13:34.986
Well, that sounds just lovely.

13:35.849 --> 13:36.816
It was.

13:37.333 --> 13:38.438
May I?

13:42.304 --> 13:44.099
Does it hurt when I press here?

13:44.099 --> 13:47.343
Okay, okay.
I'll take that as a yes.

13:47.343 --> 13:51.313
Any problems with memory,
forgetfulness, confusion?

13:51.313 --> 13:52.832
I <i>am</i> 90.

13:55.386 --> 13:57.698
But I just won
all three matches

13:57.698 --> 14:00.046
at last week's cribbage game.

14:00.909 --> 14:02.220
So I guess it could be worse.

14:02.842 --> 14:03.981
Card sharp, huh?

14:03.981 --> 14:05.637
Mm-hmm.

14:05.637 --> 14:08.848
Edna, this tumor's a monster.

14:09.814 --> 14:11.643
To take it out
would be very risky.

14:11.643 --> 14:15.302
You might not survive
the procedure, or worse.

14:17.235 --> 14:21.239
Ventilator, chronic pain, immobilization.

14:21.239 --> 14:23.241
Dr. Park went through
all of this with you?

14:24.001 --> 14:25.243
Yes, he did.

14:27.004 --> 14:28.315
I want the surgery.

14:31.905 --> 14:34.011
And another
butterscotch pudding.

14:34.011 --> 14:35.564
When you have a moment.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.016
I'll see what I can do.

14:46.092 --> 14:47.334
We're doing the surgery.

14:48.301 --> 14:49.923
You know
Edna's heart stopped, right?

14:49.923 --> 14:51.891
And restarted
without a defibrillator.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.169
This is a huge surgery
for a 20-year-old.

14:54.169 --> 14:56.274
And? Age isn't the only issue.

14:56.274 --> 14:58.345
Okay, she has
no idea what
she's getting herself into.

14:58.345 --> 14:59.450
I think she does.

14:59.450 --> 15:00.692
Well, she's blindly optimistic.

15:00.692 --> 15:02.694
Or is it blind faith?
What's the difference?

15:02.694 --> 15:04.213
She wants to have the surgery.

15:04.213 --> 15:07.596
That faith could destroy
what little quality of life
she has left.

15:09.046 --> 15:10.081
Her call.

15:13.429 --> 15:15.224
W-We need to radically
slash power consumption.

15:15.224 --> 15:17.847
Your servers
are pulling more energy
than any other department.

15:17.847 --> 15:18.918
For good reason.

15:18.918 --> 15:20.022
If all of our servers go down,

15:20.022 --> 15:21.886
that'll take out
the SmartEnergy Hub.

15:21.886 --> 15:23.060
What's a SmartEnergy Hub?

15:23.060 --> 15:25.096
It directs power to areas
that need it the most

15:25.096 --> 15:26.718
and reduces it
to areas that don't.

15:26.718 --> 15:29.376
Without it, I can't guarantee
the generators won't overload.

15:29.376 --> 15:31.758
Our backup system
needs a backup?

15:31.758 --> 15:33.794
If we didn't have the Hub,
we'd be working
in the dark already.

15:33.794 --> 15:34.968
We need to act now.

15:34.968 --> 15:36.832
Shut down the top two floors,
relocate the patients.

15:36.832 --> 15:40.318
And compromise the medical care
of over 80 people?

15:40.318 --> 15:43.321
I'll look after the patients,
you look after that Hub.

15:46.359 --> 15:49.051
We need to talk about
why I don't like you.

15:50.190 --> 15:51.260
Sounds fun.

15:51.260 --> 15:53.814
Your hand lotion smells
strongly of almonds.

15:53.814 --> 15:55.264
Injecting contrast.

15:55.264 --> 15:56.610
You are stubborn
and intractable,

15:56.610 --> 15:59.130
as demonstrated by refusing
to transplant a pig's heart,

15:59.130 --> 16:01.477
ignoring proper procedure
for inserting an IV--

16:01.477 --> 16:02.962
And I didn't back you up
on Lim's surgery.

16:04.377 --> 16:06.137
You were wrong about that too.

16:07.483 --> 16:08.622
The feeling's mutual.

16:10.210 --> 16:11.763
Very stubborn.

16:11.763 --> 16:14.076
And... almonds.

16:16.734 --> 16:20.255
I've seen you get distracted
when something irritates
your sensibilities.

16:20.255 --> 16:22.498
Never seen that
make you a jackass.

16:27.710 --> 16:31.059
The coronary artery
is coming off the pulmonary,
not the aorta.

16:31.059 --> 16:34.476
This is very rare
and will require
a very complicated surgery.

16:34.476 --> 16:35.822
He could drop dead
at any minute.

16:37.030 --> 16:38.273
Yes, he could.

16:43.174 --> 16:44.555
Okay.

16:44.555 --> 16:46.798
How about
a coronary artery bypass?

16:52.390 --> 16:54.289
Swamp cooler.

16:54.289 --> 16:57.568
Okay, Brooks' anatomy
is far too complex
for a bypass.

16:57.568 --> 17:00.674
We won't have all
the necessary information
until we open him up.

17:02.435 --> 17:04.368
Why don't we do
a cardiac MRI first?

17:04.368 --> 17:07.957
That would be useless.
His arteries are too tortuous
and dilated.

17:07.957 --> 17:10.132
It'd make interpretation
of images impossible.

17:11.582 --> 17:14.240
Okay, so your plan
is to have no plan?

17:14.240 --> 17:17.898
My plan is to open him up,
observe, and improvise.

17:17.898 --> 17:20.418
- You can't improvise
the most complicated--
- Stop contradicting me.

17:20.418 --> 17:22.869
I have more surgical
experience than you.

17:22.869 --> 17:25.182
Yes, and it's your job
to teach me.

17:25.182 --> 17:27.874
Then why do you act
like you know as much as I do?

17:30.739 --> 17:32.258
Knowing why I don't like her

17:32.258 --> 17:34.398
isn't going to help
because she won't change.

17:37.228 --> 17:38.885
You're off the case.

17:51.449 --> 17:53.900
We just lost
our first server.

17:56.385 --> 17:58.594
How about ECMO and CRRT?

17:58.594 --> 18:00.941
That could bridge May
to multi-organ transplant
and we could even--

18:00.941 --> 18:04.773
Danny, she won't even
tolerate anticoagulation.

18:05.946 --> 18:06.947
Right.

18:30.316 --> 18:32.421
How you holding up, Chief?

18:32.421 --> 18:35.390
My office is a sauna,
the Wi-Fi died,

18:35.390 --> 18:38.047
and I just lost
my last two hours of work.

18:38.047 --> 18:39.911
Well, Andrews
just put the hospital

18:39.911 --> 18:41.327
and the ER
on full divert status,

18:41.327 --> 18:44.399
so we both have
the next couple hours free.

18:46.090 --> 18:47.781
The AC at the VA
is still working.

18:47.781 --> 18:50.129
Oh, I have
physical therapy in 20.

18:51.371 --> 18:53.235
You go to therapy to get better
when you're injured.

18:54.857 --> 18:56.238
I <i>am</i> injured.

18:56.238 --> 18:59.103
You <i>were.</i> You're not anymore.

19:00.035 --> 19:01.347
Living with
a physical disability

19:01.347 --> 19:05.178
is not like living with,
like, cancer.

19:05.178 --> 19:08.699
You're not dying.
You're not sick.

19:08.699 --> 19:11.805
I see a healthy, fully capable
woman sitting across from me.

19:12.668 --> 19:14.601
At some point,

19:14.601 --> 19:16.638
you need to start seeing
yourself like that, too.

19:25.060 --> 19:26.303
You were right.

19:28.546 --> 19:29.789
About the wander bracelet.

19:29.789 --> 19:32.136
Andrews was looking at me.

19:33.206 --> 19:35.035
Are you just saying that
to make me feel better?

19:35.035 --> 19:36.968
- Did it work?
- No.

19:43.251 --> 19:46.495
When I was a junior
in high school,
I made this vision board.

19:46.495 --> 19:49.878
Two horses,
Olympic medal in archery,

19:49.878 --> 19:51.155
tour with NSYNC.

19:51.155 --> 19:53.157
All goals that I'm okay
with not accomplishing, but...

19:55.401 --> 19:57.196
Being a surgeon,
getting married,

19:58.507 --> 19:59.508
having kids?

20:00.854 --> 20:02.753
One of those
is already off the table,

20:02.753 --> 20:05.721
and the others feel like
they're sliding out of reach.

20:07.413 --> 20:11.002
I just-- I feel like there's
this huge hole in my life.

20:16.870 --> 20:18.217
You had a vision board?

20:21.185 --> 20:22.221
There he is.

20:25.327 --> 20:28.917
Mr. Abbott! Art! Hi.

20:28.917 --> 20:31.057
We're doctors
from the hospital.

20:31.057 --> 20:32.783
Let's get you
out of this heat, okay?

20:44.898 --> 20:46.210
He's all yours, Starsky.

20:51.111 --> 20:52.112
Mr. Abbott!

20:53.528 --> 20:54.563
Art!

21:08.853 --> 21:10.614
I was nervous
my first time, too.

21:11.649 --> 21:13.064
Shouldn't they lower the hoops?

21:14.411 --> 21:16.930
You've been pushing that
chair around for months.

21:16.930 --> 21:18.277
I'm sure your arms
are up to it.

21:19.692 --> 21:21.452
Today is about fun, remember?

21:21.452 --> 21:22.798
Ooh, you're tall.

21:23.730 --> 21:24.800
Good reach too.

21:25.801 --> 21:27.320
Audrey, this is Clay.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.046
He's captain
of the losing team.

21:29.046 --> 21:31.186
Mm, love your optimism, Powell.

21:31.945 --> 21:33.637
You're 0 for 6 against us.

21:33.637 --> 21:35.846
Right, which is why
I call dibs on the newb.

21:35.846 --> 21:39.746
She who brings
the long-armed newb
plays the long-armed newb.

21:40.506 --> 21:42.128
I think I'll just watch.

21:42.128 --> 21:44.786
Oh, come on. You will love it.

21:57.177 --> 21:59.283
You're gonna improvise?

21:59.283 --> 22:02.769
Based on my visual assessment
of your anomalous anatomy.

22:02.769 --> 22:04.323
So you're going to have to make

22:04.323 --> 22:06.014
a lot of decisions
in the moment?

22:06.014 --> 22:07.705
Oh, at least six.

22:07.705 --> 22:09.017
Where's Dr. Powell?

22:09.017 --> 22:12.469
Off the case.
But she will be replaced.

22:13.849 --> 22:14.954
I want her back,

22:16.024 --> 22:17.957
challenging
every decision you make.

22:17.957 --> 22:20.684
Her challenges
have not been useful.

22:25.413 --> 22:29.348
Israeli Intelligence refuses
to make any major decisions

22:29.348 --> 22:32.730
until they are thoroughly
challenged by the Tenth Man,

22:32.730 --> 22:36.803
a person assigned to raise
every possible pitfall

22:36.803 --> 22:38.978
before proceeding.

22:38.978 --> 22:42.084
I have a successful business
because of it.

22:43.879 --> 22:45.364
If you can't work
with a Tenth Man,

22:46.986 --> 22:48.470
I'll find a surgeon who can.

22:53.855 --> 22:55.166
We're gonna get you
cooled down.

22:56.927 --> 22:58.480
Jerome! Jerome!

22:58.480 --> 22:59.861
We found Art!

22:59.861 --> 23:02.415
No. I found him.

23:03.554 --> 23:04.728
In the hospital laundry room.

23:09.422 --> 23:10.872
So who did you kidnap?

23:10.872 --> 23:13.495

I'm picking your pocket, newb.

Yeah, I'm open!

23:45.527 --> 23:46.804
Stay out of my lane.

23:48.288 --> 23:49.600
Pass it!

23:53.880 --> 23:55.295

24:23.462 --> 24:25.084
Oh.

24:25.084 --> 24:26.154
Ow.

24:44.552 --> 24:45.863
She doesn't have much longer.

24:55.321 --> 24:56.771
We're taking May to Paris.

25:05.711 --> 25:07.644
I kicked Powell off my case,

25:07.644 --> 25:10.198
but the patient said
I can't do his surgery
without a Tenth Man,

25:10.198 --> 25:12.131
but I don't want
to work with Powell
as a Tenth Man

25:12.131 --> 25:13.442
because I don't like her.

25:13.442 --> 25:15.514
I work with people
I don't like all the time.

25:16.238 --> 25:17.239
Carol.

25:18.724 --> 25:20.829
Focus on the good,
forget the bad.

25:20.829 --> 25:23.211
There is nothing good
about Powell.

25:23.211 --> 25:24.246
Really?

25:25.213 --> 25:27.905
If there is,
I don't know how to find it.

25:29.044 --> 25:30.287
Common ground.

25:30.287 --> 25:32.738
Find the-- the--
the common ground.

25:32.738 --> 25:34.360
My father-in-law, for instance.

25:34.360 --> 25:38.019
We were like frozen Popsicles
in a-- in a freezer.

25:38.019 --> 25:39.676
- Popsicles?
- Metaphor.

25:39.676 --> 25:41.367
We were so uncomfortable
around each other.

25:41.367 --> 25:43.645
He didn't like me,
I didn't like him.

25:43.645 --> 25:46.579
And then, on Maddie's
fifth birthday party,

25:46.579 --> 25:50.031
my father-in-law
pulled out a deck of cards

25:50.031 --> 25:53.724
and performs, to perfection,
this magic card trick.

25:53.724 --> 25:56.831
I'd been fumbling over
that same card trick for years.

25:56.831 --> 25:58.349
I used to have a magic show.

25:59.212 --> 26:01.352
Amazing Aaron's... Magic Show.

26:02.595 --> 26:06.047
And from that point on,
we thawed out, you know?

26:06.806 --> 26:09.119
And we were never close,

26:09.119 --> 26:10.741
but we were okay
around each other.

26:12.778 --> 26:13.848
Common ground.

26:18.715 --> 26:20.130
Simile.

26:49.124 --> 26:51.575
It was two months
before I scored in a game.

26:51.575 --> 26:54.613
Ugh, I won't be able
to move my arms tomorrow.
Not good for a surgeon.

26:55.510 --> 26:57.374
- 0 for 7, Doc.
- Mm-hmm.

26:57.374 --> 26:59.065
- You're a doctor?
- Pediatrician.

26:59.065 --> 27:00.895
I play much better
against the kids.

27:01.965 --> 27:04.105
Just for the record,
I did not love that.

27:04.105 --> 27:06.279
No? Then why are you smiling?

27:06.279 --> 27:07.384
It's more of a grimace.

27:07.384 --> 27:08.454
Oh? Maybe.

27:08.454 --> 27:10.249
Or maybe it's nice.

27:11.733 --> 27:13.977
You know, being treated
like a normal person again.

27:13.977 --> 27:17.843
That patronizing politeness
accorded to the helpless,
vulnerable invalid?

27:17.843 --> 27:19.223
That crap gets old fast.

27:20.915 --> 27:22.192
Same time next week?

27:23.262 --> 27:24.435
Not a chance in hell.

27:24.435 --> 27:25.505
Okay.

27:28.888 --> 27:30.510
And I'm back on the case.

27:31.477 --> 27:32.858
I didn't know you were off it.

27:44.352 --> 27:46.492
Figure you can use these
more now than I can.

27:46.492 --> 27:47.700
Already lost one generator,

27:47.700 --> 27:49.184
and the other
is on its last legs.

27:49.184 --> 27:51.324
ICU and OR are the only places
with working AC.

27:51.324 --> 27:53.672
The whole hospital
could go dark at any time.

27:54.707 --> 27:56.467
You're gonna fire me,
aren't you?

27:56.467 --> 27:58.055
Not if the board
fires me first.

28:02.508 --> 28:04.510
I got to make some calls.

28:04.510 --> 28:05.718
Number six.

28:10.171 --> 28:11.517
Lung is clear.
Moving on.

28:13.243 --> 28:14.658
Give her a bump of Dilt.

28:14.658 --> 28:16.798
We don't want her heart
going haywire

28:16.798 --> 28:18.697
while we're trying
to pull this thing off of it.

28:21.182 --> 28:22.735
Renal parenchyma isn't clear.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.634
I can't resect
this aspect of the tumor

28:25.634 --> 28:27.326
without sacrificing the kidney.

28:30.191 --> 28:31.226
Take the kidney.

28:33.712 --> 28:35.610
Well, she'll need
full-on dialysis.

28:35.610 --> 28:37.646
She'll be looking
at blood-pressure volatility,

28:37.646 --> 28:39.234
fainting spells,
electrolyte imbalances--

28:39.234 --> 28:41.202
She can live with it.
Take the kidney.

28:47.484 --> 28:50.038
When my grandfather
got pancreatic cancer,

28:51.384 --> 28:54.560
my grandmother pushed
his doctors to operate.

28:54.560 --> 28:58.702
And complications from surgery
cost him everything that
made his life worth living.

28:58.702 --> 29:01.187
Now, he could have spent
his last few months

29:01.187 --> 29:03.051
in palliative care
with his family.

29:03.051 --> 29:05.536
Instead, he got three years
of pain and misery.

29:06.917 --> 29:10.438
Now, we stop now, she'll have
a few more good months.

29:13.303 --> 29:14.304
Butterscotch pudding.

29:18.308 --> 29:20.413
Life is hard.

29:20.413 --> 29:25.073
Sometimes the pain of loss
or whatever is so acute,

29:25.073 --> 29:27.282
you don't know how
you're gonna go on or why.

29:28.836 --> 29:31.079
And then you find a reason
or a reason finds you.

29:31.977 --> 29:33.081
Someone needs you.

29:33.910 --> 29:35.118
You find love, a purpose.

29:37.499 --> 29:40.779
Dialysis isn't going
to stop Edna from the joy

29:40.779 --> 29:43.609
of seeing her granddaughter
or the rustling of the leaves,

29:45.611 --> 29:46.888
or butterscotch pudding.

29:54.344 --> 29:55.655
I'll take the kidney.

30:07.391 --> 30:09.428
Brooks' unstable angina
has worsened.

30:09.428 --> 30:11.085
The surgery can't wait.

30:20.680 --> 30:22.717
Do you watch
The Weather Channel?

30:24.029 --> 30:26.928
This is San Jose.
There is no weather.

30:26.928 --> 30:28.033
Other than today.

30:30.380 --> 30:32.623
Helsinki has a lot of weather.

30:33.659 --> 30:36.213
You watch
Finnish weather reports?

30:36.213 --> 30:40.804
I find using science
as a predictive tool
very reassuring.

30:42.392 --> 30:44.152
I've seen
some good weather movies.

30:44.152 --> 30:46.120
<i>Twister,
The Day After Tomorrow--</i>

30:46.120 --> 30:47.707
Those movies
are very unrealistic.

30:47.707 --> 30:50.055
<i>- Sharknado.</i>
- Pancakes.
Do you like pancakes?

30:51.159 --> 30:52.402
Not much of a carb person.

30:53.679 --> 30:55.025
I do love banh xeo.

30:55.025 --> 30:58.201
Vietnamese crepes,
stuffed with
pickled daikon radish--

30:58.201 --> 30:59.823
No, those are not pancakes.

31:02.895 --> 31:05.001
We have no common ground.

31:05.001 --> 31:08.383
Dr. Glassman's advice
is not useful,
nor Lea's advice.

31:08.383 --> 31:09.868
I still do not like you.

31:18.911 --> 31:21.707
That's every
senior care facility
within a five-mile radius.

31:26.332 --> 31:27.437
Alamitos?

31:29.197 --> 31:30.336
Vista Park?

31:31.890 --> 31:33.063
Edenvale?

31:34.030 --> 31:36.342
Any of those places
ring a bell?

31:39.898 --> 31:41.451
Where's my Emma?

31:48.285 --> 31:50.184
I'm gonna end up
in Edenvale, aren't I?

31:51.323 --> 31:53.221
With no one
to report me missing.

31:53.221 --> 31:54.636
No, you're not.

31:55.983 --> 31:57.294
Edenvale's far too exclusive.

31:59.124 --> 32:01.540
Come on. You know you're gonna
get back together with Park.

32:04.957 --> 32:05.924
Sam?

32:10.411 --> 32:11.757
Someone just called our ER

32:11.757 --> 32:17.418
looking for
a 91-year-old Samuel McIntyre
of 378 Meadow Drive.

32:17.418 --> 32:19.868
We really did kidnap him.

32:19.868 --> 32:22.664
His grandson Kyle
is coming to pick him up.

32:22.664 --> 32:26.151
As in Kyle McIntyre,
Attorney at Law.

32:33.503 --> 32:35.988
Solar energy company's
delivering a battery truck ASAP,

32:35.988 --> 32:37.714
which would give us
all the power we need.

32:37.714 --> 32:38.784
That's fantastic.

32:38.784 --> 32:40.061
Except we can't access it.

32:40.061 --> 32:42.477
It's DC power,
and they don't
have an inverter.

32:43.789 --> 32:47.482
MRIs run on DC.
They must have inverters.

32:47.482 --> 32:49.588
I'm not sure they can
integrate it into our grid.

32:49.588 --> 32:50.830
Well, we're gonna find out.

32:50.830 --> 32:52.073
Have engineering
take an inverter

32:52.073 --> 32:53.902
- to the electrical room.
- Okay.

32:57.941 --> 32:58.977
What's happening?

32:59.943 --> 33:02.428
We're taking you
on a little trip, May.

33:02.428 --> 33:04.016
Just sit back and enjoy.

33:07.951 --> 33:09.297
Welcome to Paris.

33:12.645 --> 33:13.715

33:34.874 --> 33:35.979
Ah.

33:37.222 --> 33:39.810
And... the Eiffel Tower.

33:42.434 --> 33:44.125
We made it after all.

Brooks' coronary anatomy
is very, very unusual.

34:18.642 --> 34:20.230
Yes, it is.

34:21.749 --> 34:25.166
I was hoping to implant
the coronary artery
directly onto the aorta.

34:25.166 --> 34:26.650
- It won't reach.
- I know.

34:26.650 --> 34:28.066
I was about to say that.

34:29.136 --> 34:31.862
Sorry. Sorry.

34:35.797 --> 34:38.006
We could do a bypass
with a homograft, although--

34:38.006 --> 34:39.077
The graft would clot.

34:39.077 --> 34:40.457
I was getting to that.

34:40.457 --> 34:41.976
I don't need your bad ideas.

34:41.976 --> 34:44.116
I was hoping you'd hear it
and make it a better idea.

34:44.116 --> 34:45.911
- Stop talking.
- No!

34:51.330 --> 34:53.539
I'm fine
with you not liking me,

34:53.539 --> 34:56.611
but that doesn't mean
you get to disregard my ideas.

34:56.611 --> 34:58.061
And I would've thought
that you'd understand

34:58.061 --> 35:00.270
exactly what it's like
to be treated as the other.

35:00.270 --> 35:03.480
You want to find common ground?
That's our common ground.

35:09.969 --> 35:12.903
We can use a modified
Takeuchi procedure

35:12.903 --> 35:15.251
to tunnel the RCA
using TEE guidance.

35:16.976 --> 35:19.289
Great plan.
I'll cross clamp the aorta.

35:33.993 --> 35:35.340
It <i>was</i> a great plan.

35:40.586 --> 35:43.796
We need to do
an off-pump modification
of the trap door technique.

35:43.796 --> 35:45.143
Number 15 scalpel.

35:45.143 --> 35:47.455
Without electrocautery,
there's a huge risk
he'll bleed out.

35:48.284 --> 35:49.526
We need to improvise.

35:50.562 --> 35:52.115
What about adjustable
ligature technique

35:52.115 --> 35:53.910
to cinch down bleeding vessels?

35:53.910 --> 35:57.051
That is from the Civil War.

35:57.051 --> 35:59.916
I'm a little bit
of a surgical history geek.

35:59.916 --> 36:01.642
55 over 32. He's critical.

36:03.402 --> 36:06.716
That ligature technique
could permanently damage
the vasculature.

36:06.716 --> 36:08.511
We will do
the off-pump modification.

36:17.105 --> 36:19.832
In the Civil War,
they also used heat on metal.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.180
To cauterize.

36:23.388 --> 36:25.079
I'm sure
somebody has a lighter.

36:31.223 --> 36:32.707
I'll cut,
you cauterize.

36:40.922 --> 36:42.027
Is this gonna work?

36:44.167 --> 36:46.549
It's not rated
for this energy load.

36:53.038 --> 36:54.729
BP is 48 over palp.

36:55.247 --> 36:56.214
We're losing him.

36:58.733 --> 36:59.907
Okay.

37:20.755 --> 37:22.688
Anastomosis complete.

37:22.688 --> 37:24.138
Unclamping the aorta.

37:31.145 --> 37:32.388
Heart is perfusing.

37:33.458 --> 37:36.461
61 over 40.
He's stabilizing.

37:53.132 --> 37:54.548
Wonder if Jerome
will wait for me.

37:56.274 --> 37:57.654
Till we get out of jail.

38:07.423 --> 38:08.596
Grandpa Sam!

38:11.081 --> 38:13.394
There's my Emma.

38:21.299 --> 38:24.509
He just recently
started to wander.

38:24.509 --> 38:27.305
I don't know
where you found him,
but with the heat today...

38:30.135 --> 38:31.757
you probably saved his life.

Nice job.

40:46.616 --> 40:47.652
Back at you.

40:55.453 --> 40:57.455
Maybe you can meet a guy
in a tango class.

41:02.943 --> 41:04.600
That hole in my life?

41:04.600 --> 41:06.084
It's not that I want
a boyfriend.

41:10.951 --> 41:12.090
I want a child.

41:24.620 --> 41:26.484
Brooks' EKG is perfect.

41:28.796 --> 41:29.763
Hmm.

41:31.799 --> 41:35.665
The first brain surgery
was performed in ancient Egypt.

41:35.665 --> 41:36.839
The patient died.

41:38.047 --> 41:40.118
I heard they found
surgical tools
in a pharaoh's tomb.

41:41.637 --> 41:43.190
They were made of bronze.

41:44.640 --> 41:47.194
There's a great surgical museum
in Chicago.

41:47.194 --> 41:48.782
You should
check it out sometime.

41:53.476 --> 41:55.133
Well, what happened there?

41:59.240 --> 42:01.139
She changed her hand lotion.

42:07.904 --> 42:09.216
How do you feel about tennis?

42:11.425 --> 42:12.840
I play every Saturday.

42:12.840 --> 42:14.566
Unless you're too busy with PT.

42:18.846 --> 42:20.814
I think I might be ready
to graduate.
