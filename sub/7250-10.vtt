WEBVTT

00:02.670 --> 00:04.171
WE CAN

00:02.670 --> 00:04.171
REHEARSE IN YOUR GARAGE?

00:04.212 --> 00:05.965
IN EXCHANGE FOR THE PROMISE

00:06.005 --> 00:08.509
THAT YOU NEVER POSE NAKED

00:06.005 --> 00:08.509
ON THE ROLLING STONE'S COVER,

00:08.550 --> 00:10.302
DESPITE HOW MUCH TROUBLE

00:08.550 --> 00:10.302
YOUR CAREER'S IN.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.762
I PROMISE.

00:10.344 --> 00:11.762
I LOVE YOU.

00:11.804 --> 00:13.555
YOU KNOW HOW AMAZING

00:11.804 --> 00:13.555
YOUR MOTHER IS?

00:13.597 --> 00:15.850
NO. TELL HER, WOULD YOU?

00:13.597 --> 00:15.850
SHE FORGOT THIS MORNING.

00:15.891 --> 00:18.310
BECAUSE HOT WATER'S

00:15.891 --> 00:18.310
ENJOYED BY ALL.

00:18.352 --> 00:19.645
MY SHOWER WASN'T THAT LONG.

00:19.687 --> 00:22.272
IT'S WINTER CARNIVAL TIME

00:19.687 --> 00:22.272
AGAIN ALREADY.

00:22.314 --> 00:24.023
ARE YOU GOING?

00:22.314 --> 00:24.023
I HAVE TO.

00:24.065 --> 00:26.067
WE'RE RAISING MONEY

00:24.065 --> 00:26.067
FOR THE MARCHING BAND.

00:26.109 --> 00:27.945
MANDATORY BOOTH-MANNING

00:26.109 --> 00:27.945
IS INVOLVED.

00:27.987 --> 00:29.905
MAN, LANE --

00:27.987 --> 00:29.905
MARCHING BAND, ROCK BAND.

00:29.947 --> 00:30.990
MUSIC IS MY LIFE.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.366
HI, MRS. KIM!

00:32.407 --> 00:33.951
<i>SO</i> NOT FUNNY.

00:33.993 --> 00:35.744
RAISING MONEY FOR

00:33.993 --> 00:35.744
THE BAND FOR WHAT?

00:35.786 --> 00:37.830
PLEASE LET IT BE

00:35.786 --> 00:37.830
NEW UNIFORMS.

00:37.872 --> 00:39.874
IT'S SO WE CAN

00:37.872 --> 00:39.874
FINALLY HAVE LETTER CARRIERS.

00:39.915 --> 00:41.375
THE POWERS THAT BE

00:41.416 --> 00:43.418
THINK THE REASON

00:41.416 --> 00:43.418
WE NEVER WIN AT COMPETITIONS

00:43.460 --> 00:46.505
IS BECAUSE NO ONE KNOWS US.

00:43.460 --> 00:46.505
NOT THE FACT THAT WE SUCK.

00:46.547 --> 00:48.089
WHAT'S WRONG WITH OUR UNIFORMS?

00:46.547 --> 00:48.089
NOTHING.

00:48.131 --> 00:49.383
WE LOOK STUPID, RIGHT?

00:48.131 --> 00:49.383
NO.

00:49.424 --> 00:50.926
THE PLUMES ARE

00:49.424 --> 00:50.926
BIG, LOOKS LIKE

00:50.968 --> 00:52.469
RED FOUNTAINS

00:50.968 --> 00:52.469
OF BLOOD SPURTING OUT.

00:52.511 --> 00:54.013
I-I LOVE THE UNIFORMS.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.056
BAD ENOUGH I GOTTA<i> BE IN</i>

00:54.054 --> 00:56.056
<i>MARCHING BAND,</i>

00:56.097 --> 00:59.560
WITHOUT BEING MOCKED FOR WHAT IS

00:56.097 --> 00:59.560
MANDATORY FOR US TO WEAR.

00:59.601 --> 01:01.854
REMIND HER THAT SHE CAN

00:59.601 --> 01:01.854
REHEARSE IN OUR GARAGE,

01:01.896 --> 01:03.605
'CAUSE I THINK

01:01.896 --> 01:03.605
I'M LOSING POINTS.

01:03.647 --> 01:06.149
YOUR UNIFORMS ARE GREAT, AND

01:03.647 --> 01:06.149
PEOPLE KNOWING YOU CAN HELP.

01:06.191 --> 01:08.360
LET'S JUST

01:06.191 --> 01:08.360
ENJOY THE SNOW, OKAY?

01:08.402 --> 01:10.404
ESPECIALLY, SINCE SOME

01:08.402 --> 01:10.404
OF US HAVE BEEN FREEZING

01:10.445 --> 01:12.740
SINCE OUR SHOWERS THIS MORNING.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.740
I WASN'T THAT LONG.

01:12.781 --> 01:15.576
CAN WE RETURN TO THE UNIFORMS?

01:12.781 --> 01:15.576
ON A SCALE 1-10

01:15.617 --> 01:18.161
HOW MUCH DO I NOT

01:15.617 --> 01:18.161
WANNA LET DAVE SEE ME?

01:18.203 --> 01:19.162
10.     10.

01:19.204 --> 01:20.664

02:18.221 --> 02:20.099
START BY SPLITTING

02:18.221 --> 02:20.099
THE INTEGRAL INTO TWO.

02:20.140 --> 02:21.892
SINCE THE LEFT INTEGRAL'S

02:20.140 --> 02:21.892
A VARIABLE OF

02:21.934 --> 02:23.936
A CONSTANT EXPONENT--

02:21.934 --> 02:23.936
REMEMBER C IS A CONSTANT --

02:23.978 --> 02:25.980

02:23.978 --> 02:25.980

02:26.021 --> 02:27.689
Paris, what did he say?

02:26.021 --> 02:27.689
Hmm?

02:27.731 --> 02:29.650
He's talking too fast.

02:27.731 --> 02:29.650
I missed it.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.611
Ask Louise.

02:29.691 --> 02:32.611
Louise, what did he say?

02:32.653 --> 02:34.738
Ask Paris.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.738
She told me to ask you.

02:34.780 --> 02:36.865
Why would she do that?

02:34.780 --> 02:36.865
I don't know.

02:36.907 --> 02:39.660
Did you guys have a fight?

02:36.907 --> 02:39.660
Not that I know of.

02:39.701 --> 02:42.203
THE RIGHT INTEGRAL, HOWEVER,

02:39.701 --> 02:42.203
IS MORE COMPLEX.

02:42.245 --> 02:45.958
YOU HAVE TO USE U-SUBSTITUTION,

02:42.245 --> 02:45.958
WITH U EQUALS 3 FEET.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.960
WE'LL PICK UP

02:46.000 --> 02:47.960
AT THE SAME PLACE TOMORROW.

02:51.005 --> 02:52.840
THE BELL RANG.

02:51.005 --> 02:52.840
WHAT?

02:52.881 --> 02:54.633
THE BELL -- THAT LOUD

02:52.881 --> 02:54.633
METAL MUSICAL CONTRAPTION

02:54.675 --> 02:56.468
WHEN HIT LOUDLY

02:54.675 --> 02:56.468
BY A VIBRATING MALLET,

02:56.510 --> 03:00.597
SIGNALS THE END OF THIS

02:56.510 --> 03:00.597
PARTICULAR EDUCATIONAL

02:56.510 --> 03:00.597
EXPERIENCE.

03:00.639 --> 03:02.141
CLASS IS OVER?

03:00.639 --> 03:02.141
YEAH.

03:02.181 --> 03:03.934
WHAT DID HE TALK ABOUT?

03:02.181 --> 03:03.934
ASK LOUISE.

03:03.976 --> 03:06.020
I DIDN'T TAKE NOTES.

03:03.976 --> 03:06.020
I DIDN'T PAY ATTENTION.

03:06.061 --> 03:08.229
I'M GONNA...

03:06.061 --> 03:08.229
BORROW MY NOTES, YOU'LL BE FINE.

03:08.271 --> 03:11.692
THANK YOU.

03:08.271 --> 03:11.692
MADELINE WANT NOTES, TOO.

03:11.733 --> 03:14.361
"ADD 1 AND DIVIDE

03:11.733 --> 03:14.361
BY THE<i> NEW</i> POWER"?

03:14.402 --> 03:17.447
I THOUGHT IT SAID "ADD 1

03:14.402 --> 03:17.447
AND DIVIDE BY THE<i> JEW</i> POWER."

03:17.489 --> 03:19.240
IT MAKES MUCH MORE

03:17.489 --> 03:19.240
SENSE THIS WAY.

03:19.282 --> 03:22.369
CAN'T BELIEVE I ZONED OUT.

03:19.282 --> 03:22.369
MUST HAVE LOTS ON YOUR MIND.

03:22.410 --> 03:23.537
I DO.

03:22.410 --> 03:23.537
I'M SURE.

03:23.578 --> 03:25.372
ON TO THE NEXT THING.

03:25.413 --> 03:26.999
THE PROM BIDS

03:25.413 --> 03:26.999
WON'T BE READY

03:27.041 --> 03:29.668
FOR THE SUPPLEMENTAL

03:27.041 --> 03:29.668
STUDENT-COUNCIL MEETING.

03:29.710 --> 03:31.712
THEY NEED MORE TIME

03:29.710 --> 03:31.712
TO GET THE DETAILS,

03:31.753 --> 03:33.755
SO THAT LEAVES

03:31.753 --> 03:33.755
A HOLE IN OUR AGENDA.

03:33.797 --> 03:35.423
ANY THOUGHTS?

03:35.465 --> 03:38.052
WE COULD JUST CANCEL THE

03:35.465 --> 03:38.052
SUPPLEMENTARY MEETING THIS WEEK.

03:38.093 --> 03:39.553
WHAT?!

03:39.594 --> 03:41.596
WITH NOTHING TO TALK

03:39.594 --> 03:41.596
ABOUT, WHAT'S THE POINT?

03:41.638 --> 03:44.224
YOU SAID<i> ONE</i> STUDENT-COUNCIL

03:41.638 --> 03:44.224
MEETING A WEEK WAS NOT ENOUGH.

03:44.265 --> 03:46.852
YEAH, YOU SAID

03:44.265 --> 03:46.852
THAT WAS NO WAY TO GOVERN,

03:46.894 --> 03:49.229
THAT MEETING ONCE A WEEK

03:46.894 --> 03:49.229
WAS LAZY, INEFFECTUAL,

03:49.270 --> 03:51.523
IF WE WERE DOING IT

03:49.270 --> 03:51.523
LIKE THAT, WE OUGHTA

03:51.565 --> 03:53.358
BUY OURSELVES A RANCH IN TEXAS.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.235
IF YOU WANNA

03:53.400 --> 03:55.235
SIT AROUND AFTER SCHOOL

03:55.276 --> 03:57.571
SWAPPING MAKEOVER

03:55.276 --> 03:57.571
HORROR STORIES, COUNT ME IN.

03:57.612 --> 03:59.614
DID I EVER TELL YOU

03:57.612 --> 03:59.614
ABOUT THE TIME

03:59.656 --> 04:01.992
I PLUCKED<i> OUTSIDE OF MY</i>

03:59.656 --> 04:01.992
<i>DESIGNATED BROW LINE?</i>

04:02.034 --> 04:04.870
MAN, WAS MY FACE RED.

04:02.034 --> 04:04.870
I'VE DONE THAT, TOO. IT'S BAD.

04:04.912 --> 04:06.371
SHE WAS BEING SARCASTIC.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.415
<i>I</i> WASN'T. I LOOKED

04:06.413 --> 04:08.415
SURPRISED FOR A MONTH.

04:08.456 --> 04:11.626
THIS WEEK OFF, NEXT WEEK WE'LL

04:08.456 --> 04:11.626
RETURN TO TWICE A WEEK, OKAY?

04:11.668 --> 04:13.837
SOUNDS FAIR.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.837
SOUNDS FAB.

04:13.879 --> 04:16.506
I HEARD ABOUT THE SUPPLEMENTAL

04:13.879 --> 04:16.506
STUDENT-COUNCIL MEETING.

04:16.548 --> 04:19.593
ANYTHING I NEED TO KNOW ABOUT--

04:16.548 --> 04:19.593
A NEW CHART TO BE MADE?

04:19.634 --> 04:23.346
NO, THE AGENDA SEEMS LIGHT,

04:19.634 --> 04:23.346
SO I'VE DECIDED TO CANCEL IT.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.473
AND GATHER AT

04:23.388 --> 04:25.473
THE REGULAR MEETING ON FRIDAY.

04:25.515 --> 04:27.768
WOW. THIS IS

04:25.515 --> 04:27.768
QUITE A CHANGE IN PLANS.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.062
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH IT?

04:27.809 --> 04:30.062
I'M JUST SURPRISED.

04:30.104 --> 04:31.646
YOU SEEM ATTACHED

04:30.104 --> 04:31.646
TO THOSE MEETINGS.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.024
WELL, I FINALLY GOT A BLANKY.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.024
IT'S MUCH BETTER.

04:34.066 --> 04:36.610
OKAY,

04:34.066 --> 04:36.610
NO EXTRA MEETING THIS WEEK.

04:36.651 --> 04:38.904
WHAT WILL I DO

04:36.651 --> 04:38.904
WITH ALL THAT EXTRA TIME?

04:38.946 --> 04:40.739
WELL, I GUESS

04:38.946 --> 04:40.739
I'LL THINK OF SOMETHING.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.242
TAKE A PICTURE

04:40.781 --> 04:43.242
OF WHICH OUTFIT WINS, WILL YOU?

04:43.283 --> 04:44.284
BYE, FRANCIE.

04:44.325 --> 04:45.535
BYE.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.539
I MET HIS PARENTS.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.539
YOU DID?

04:49.581 --> 04:52.333
HE BOUGHT ME A TICKET, I TOOK

04:49.581 --> 04:52.333
THE TRAIN TO PHILADELPHIA,

04:52.375 --> 04:54.377
I SPENT CHRISTMAS

04:52.375 --> 04:54.377
WITH HIM AND HIS FAMILY.

04:54.419 --> 04:57.589
SOUNDS NICE.

04:54.419 --> 04:57.589
NO, NOT NICE -- IT WAS PERFECT.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.674
THEY HAD A CHRISTMAS TREE

04:57.631 --> 04:59.674
12 FEET TALL,

04:59.716 --> 05:02.177
EVERYTHING WAS RED AND SILVER,

04:59.716 --> 05:02.177
AND THERE WAS EGGNOG.

05:02.219 --> 05:04.221
HAVE YOU EVER HAD EGGNOG?

05:02.219 --> 05:04.221
YES, I HAVE.

05:04.263 --> 05:05.847
IT'S DISGUSTING.

05:04.263 --> 05:05.847
YES, IT IS.

05:05.889 --> 05:07.933
BUT DISGUSTING

05:05.889 --> 05:07.933
IN A REALLY GREAT WAY.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.602
AND THEY HAD TINY WREATHS

05:07.975 --> 05:10.602
HANGING FROM EVERY DOORKNOB

05:10.644 --> 05:12.646
AND MISTLETOE

05:10.644 --> 05:12.646
AND CANDLES EVERYWHERE.

05:12.687 --> 05:15.440
I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT. I'VE

05:12.687 --> 05:15.440
NEVER HAD A CHRISTMAS BEFORE.

05:15.482 --> 05:18.526
ONE YEAR, I ASKED MOM

05:15.482 --> 05:18.526
IF WE COULD GET A HANUKKAH BUSH.

05:18.568 --> 05:20.612
SHE MADE ME WATCH

05:18.568 --> 05:20.612
"SHOAH" FOR A WEEK.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.697
THE PLACE SMELLED LIKE

05:20.654 --> 05:22.697
CINNAMON ALL THE TIME,

05:22.739 --> 05:24.491
THERE WAS A FIRE

05:22.739 --> 05:24.491
IN THE FIREPLACE

05:24.532 --> 05:27.911
AND A TON OF PRESENTS --

05:24.532 --> 05:27.911
I MEAN, HUNDREDS OF PRESENTS.

05:27.953 --> 05:29.454
I'M LOOKING

05:27.953 --> 05:29.454
AT THIS GIFTS MOUND,

05:29.496 --> 05:31.456
AND I'M THINKING,

05:29.496 --> 05:31.456
"EIGHT DAYS OF HANUKKAH --

05:31.498 --> 05:33.917
WHO WAS THE SKINFLINT

05:31.498 --> 05:33.917
THAT THOUGHT UP<i> THAT</i> DEAL?"

05:33.959 --> 05:36.003
DON'T THE EIGHT DAYS

05:33.959 --> 05:36.003
SYMBOLIZE SOMETHING?

05:36.044 --> 05:39.298
EIGHT DAYS OF RIPPING OFF KIDS

05:36.044 --> 05:39.298
WHO CAN'T HAVE A HANUKKAH BUSH.

05:39.338 --> 05:41.842
YOU'RE MAKING ME SAD.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.857
WANTS TO SEE YOUR HOUSE --

23:19.899 --> 23:22.568
THE ONE WITH THE MONKEY LAMP.

23:19.899 --> 23:22.568
MOM, RELAX.

23:22.609 --> 23:24.402
Is it clean?

23:22.609 --> 23:24.402
YEAH, IT'S CLEAN.

23:24.444 --> 23:26.697
IF I CAME WEARING

23:24.444 --> 23:26.697
WHITE GLOVES, WHAT'D I FIND?

23:26.739 --> 23:29.783

23:26.739 --> 23:29.783

23:29.825 --> 23:31.827
I'LL FIGURE IT

23:29.825 --> 23:31.827

23:31.869 --> 23:33.871
WHEN YOU GET WHERE?

23:31.869 --> 23:33.871
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

23:33.913 --> 23:36.165
WHEN YOU GET WHERE?

23:33.913 --> 23:36.165
I'M TURNING ONTO YOUR STREET.

23:36.207 --> 23:37.917

23:36.207 --> 23:37.917

23:37.958 --> 23:40.418
I KNOW YOU KEEP

23:37.958 --> 23:40.418
A KEY IN A TURTLE.

23:40.460 --> 23:44.173
MOM, I BEG OF YOU, MAKE A VERY

23:40.460 --> 23:44.173
DANGEROUS U-TURN AND GO BACK.

24:07.363 --> 24:09.282
THE SUPPLEMENTARY

24:07.363 --> 24:09.282
STUDENT-COUNCIL MEETING, SILLY.

24:09.323 --> 24:11.200
BUT PARIS CANCELED THAT.

24:11.242 --> 24:14.870
SHE DID, DIDN'T SHE?

24:11.242 --> 24:14.870
HMM.

24:14.912 --> 24:17.081
WHAT'S GOING ON?

24:14.912 --> 24:17.081
YOU TELL<i> US.</i>

24:17.123 --> 24:19.375
FRANCIE SAID THERE WAS

24:17.123 --> 24:19.375
AN ISSUE THAT NEEDED DISCUSSION.

24:19.417 --> 24:21.752
WE FIGURED YOU OKAYED IT.

24:19.417 --> 24:21.752
I DID NOT.

24:21.794 --> 24:23.461
MR. HUNTER,

24:21.794 --> 24:23.461
THERE'S BEEN A MISTAKE.

24:23.503 --> 24:25.089
PARIS CANCELED

24:23.503 --> 24:25.089
THIS MEETING, AND --

24:25.131 --> 24:27.383
FRANCIE APPROACHED ME

24:25.131 --> 24:27.383
AND SAID THERE WAS AN ISSUE

24:27.425 --> 24:30.761
SHE'D PLANNED TO DISCUSS

24:27.425 --> 24:30.761
AND IT WAS A BIT URGENT.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.554
YOU DIDN'T MENTION

24:30.803 --> 24:32.554
THAT YOU HAD ANYTHING.

24:32.596 --> 24:34.932
I WAS SO SURPRISED

24:32.596 --> 24:34.932
PARIS WAS CANCELING THE MEETING

24:34.974 --> 24:38.769
I FORGOT. IT WAS NEW YORK TO

24:34.974 --> 24:38.769
LONDON IN THREE HOURS OR LESS.

24:38.811 --> 24:40.604
IF YOU SIT,

24:38.811 --> 24:40.604
WE CAN GET STARTED.

24:40.646 --> 24:44.150
I MOVE WE POSTPONE THIS MEETING

24:40.646 --> 24:44.150
UNTIL PARIS CAN BE REACHED.

24:44.191 --> 24:46.277
WE'RE ALL HERE.

24:44.191 --> 24:46.277
LET'S HEAR FRANCIE OUT.

24:46.319 --> 24:49.363
YOU CAN FILL PARIS IN LATER.

24:46.319 --> 24:49.363
DID ANYONE TRY TO FIND HER?

24:49.405 --> 24:51.949
I SAW HER WALKING WITH...WHO WAS

24:49.405 --> 24:51.949
THAT, HER BROTHER?

24:51.991 --> 24:53.533
PARIS DOESN'T HAVE

24:51.991 --> 24:53.533
A BROTHER.

24:53.575 --> 24:55.995
REALLY? WELL, SHE CERTAINLY

24:53.575 --> 24:55.995
SEEMED TO KNOW HIM.

24:56.036 --> 24:58.247
FRANCIE, JUST TELL US ALL

24:56.036 --> 24:58.247
WHY WE'RE HERE.

24:58.289 --> 24:59.748
AND HOW LONG

24:58.289 --> 24:59.748
WE'RE STAYING.

24:59.790 --> 25:01.917
THE WADSWORTH MANSION

24:59.790 --> 25:01.917
HAS HAD A CANCELATION,

25:01.959 --> 25:04.711
WHICH MEANS WE CAN GET IT

25:01.959 --> 25:04.711
FOR PROM IF WE'RE QUICK.

25:04.753 --> 25:06.213
SHALL WE VOTE?

25:04.753 --> 25:06.213
HOLD ON.

25:06.255 --> 25:07.965
THE WADSWORTH MANSION

25:06.255 --> 25:07.965
IS TOO EXPENSIVE.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.592
WE'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS.

25:08.007 --> 25:10.592
THERE ARE FUNDS TO COVER IT.

25:10.634 --> 25:13.137
NOT IF WE WANT A TELESCOPE

25:10.634 --> 25:13.137
AS A SENIOR GIFT.

25:13.179 --> 25:16.640
NOT IF<i> PARIS</i> WANTS

25:13.179 --> 25:16.640
IT AS A SENIOR GIFT.

25:13.179 --> 25:16.640
WE ALL AGREED.

25:16.682 --> 25:19.226
"REACH FOR THE STARS"?

25:16.682 --> 25:19.226
NICE THEME -- ORIGINAL.

25:19.268 --> 25:22.813
WAS "BE ALL THAT

25:19.268 --> 25:22.813
YOU CAN BE" TAKEN?

25:19.268 --> 25:22.813
IT'S A GOOD GIFT.

25:22.855 --> 25:26.275
SO IS PLANTING

25:22.855 --> 25:26.275
A NICE TREE IN THE QUAD.

25:22.855 --> 25:26.275
EVERY CLASS DOES THAT.

25:26.317 --> 25:28.610
WHO ARE WE TO JUDGE

25:26.317 --> 25:28.610
THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE?

25:28.652 --> 25:30.779
LET'S VOTE.

25:28.652 --> 25:30.779
THIS ISN'T RIGHT.

25:30.821 --> 25:33.740
PARIS SHOULD BE HERE.

25:30.821 --> 25:33.740
I AGREE -- PARIS<i> SHOULD</i> BE HERE.

25:33.782 --> 25:36.285
HOWEVER, SHE'S NOT,

25:33.782 --> 25:36.285
SO ONCE AGAIN, SHALL WE VOTE?

25:36.327 --> 25:40.580
AS STUDENT-BODY VICE PRESIDENT,

25:36.327 --> 25:40.580
I NEED YOU TO CALL FOR A VOTE.

25:40.622 --> 25:42.375
THOSE IN FAVOR

25:40.622 --> 25:42.375
OF USING THE FUNDS

25:42.416 --> 25:43.876
FOR THE WADSWORTH MANSION,

25:43.917 --> 25:46.003
EVEN THOUGH

25:43.917 --> 25:46.003
WE WILL BE CHEATING

25:46.045 --> 25:47.671
THE NEXT GENERATION

25:46.045 --> 25:47.671
OF CHILTON STUDENTS,

25:47.713 --> 25:49.465
WHO'D LOVE

25:47.713 --> 25:49.465
A NICE TELESCOPE, SAY "AYE."

25:49.507 --> 25:51.800
AYE.        AYE.

25:49.507 --> 25:51.800
AYE.                        AYE.

25:51.842 --> 25:53.344
WADSWORTH MANSION IT IS.

25:53.386 --> 25:54.928
MEETING DISMISSED.

25:57.306 --> 25:59.892
CHIN UP. WE'LL MAKE IT

25:57.306 --> 25:59.892
A REALLY BIG TREE.

26:17.617 --> 26:19.328
HOLD IT RIGHT THERE!

26:19.370 --> 26:21.038
STEP BACK

26:19.370 --> 26:21.038
AND MOVE AWAY.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.748
THIS COUCH CANNOT STAY.

26:21.080 --> 26:22.748
IT CAN.

26:22.789 --> 26:24.333
IT'S AWFUL.

26:22.789 --> 26:24.333
IT CAN HEAR YOU.

26:24.375 --> 26:25.751
PLEASE?

26:24.375 --> 26:25.751
NO!

26:25.792 --> 26:27.294
WHAT ABOUT THE CHAIR?

26:27.336 --> 26:29.838
NO, THE CHAIR STAYS ALSO.

26:27.336 --> 26:29.838
WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

26:29.880 --> 26:32.132
I BROUGHT FLOWERS

26:29.880 --> 26:32.132
AND CAN'T FIND A DECENT VASE.

26:32.174 --> 26:34.676
ALL I COULD FIND WAS

26:32.174 --> 26:34.676
A CERAMIC BETTY BOOP HEAD.

26:34.718 --> 26:36.845
YOU'RE MAKING YOURSELF C-RAZY.

26:34.718 --> 26:36.845
I KNOW.

26:36.887 --> 26:38.972
WE'LL GET SOME TARPS,

26:36.887 --> 26:38.972
THROW THEM OVER EVERYTHING,

26:39.014 --> 26:40.974
TELL HER YOU'RE PAINTING.

26:39.014 --> 26:40.974
MOM, STOP IT.

26:41.016 --> 26:42.518
WHAT'S SO HORRIBLE

26:41.016 --> 26:42.518
ABOUT THIS ROOM?

26:42.560 --> 26:44.895
WELL, LOOK AT IT!

26:42.560 --> 26:44.895
I AM. I LIKE IT.

26:44.937 --> 26:46.688
YOU MAY,

26:44.937 --> 26:46.688
BUT YOUR GRANDMOTHER WON'T.

26:46.730 --> 26:49.649
SHE'S GOING TO TAKE ONE LOOK

26:46.730 --> 26:49.649
AT THE JUNK-STORE COLLECTION

26:49.691 --> 26:51.693
OF HOBO FURNITURE,

26:49.691 --> 26:51.693
AND SHE'S GONNA BLAME<i> ME --</i>

26:51.735 --> 26:54.029
FOR WHAT?

26:51.735 --> 26:54.029
FOR LETTING YOU LIVE LIKE THIS.

26:54.071 --> 26:55.948
NOT TEACHING YOU BETTER,

26:54.071 --> 26:55.948
NOT REDECORATING

26:55.989 --> 26:58.742
WHILE YOU WERE OUTTA TOWN.

26:55.989 --> 26:58.742
WE'RE<i> NEVER</i> OUT OF TOWN.

26:58.784 --> 27:01.412
FOR NOT SENDING YOU OUTTA TOWN

26:58.784 --> 27:01.412
SO I<i> COULD</i> REDECORATE!

27:01.454 --> 27:03.122
YOU DON'T BELIEVE THAT.

27:03.163 --> 27:05.458
EVERYTHING THAT'S WRONG

27:03.163 --> 27:05.458
IN YOUR LIFE IS MY FAULT.

27:05.499 --> 27:08.001
EVERYTHING THAT'S WRONG IN

27:05.499 --> 27:08.001
YOUR FATHER'S LIFE IS MY FAULT.

27:08.043 --> 27:10.129
BASICALLY, EVERYTHING

27:08.043 --> 27:10.129
THAT'S WRONG IS MY FAULT.

27:10.170 --> 27:13.631
MOM, WOULD YOU SIT DOWN

27:10.170 --> 27:13.631
FOR A MINUTE?

27:13.673 --> 27:14.716
[ SIGHS ]

27:14.758 --> 27:16.885
AND IT'S LUMPY.

27:14.758 --> 27:16.885

27:16.927 --> 27:19.513
IF I MAY, I'D LIKE

27:16.927 --> 27:19.513
TO GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE.

27:19.555 --> 27:21.348
YOU WOULD?

27:21.390 --> 27:23.725
YOU NEED A DEFENSE MECHANISM

27:21.390 --> 27:23.725
FOR DEALING WITH HER.

27:23.767 --> 27:25.727
WHAT'RE YOU SAYING?

27:23.767 --> 27:25.727
YOU NEED A SYSTEM.

27:25.769 --> 27:28.021
TAKE ME, FOR EXAMPLE.

27:25.769 --> 27:28.021
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

27:28.063 --> 27:31.191
I KNOW THERE ARE MANY THINGS

27:28.063 --> 27:31.191
IN MY LIFE YOU DON'T LIKE.

THIS COUCH IS TERRIBLE.

27:34.861 --> 27:37.114
OKAY. GOOD.

27:34.861 --> 27:37.114
YOU THINK THE COUCH IS TERRIBLE.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.699
AT ONE POINT IN MY LIFE,

27:37.156 --> 27:39.699
YOU SAYING A COUCH

27:42.536 --> 27:45.831
MY FEELINGS, BUT NOT ANYMORE.

27:45.872 --> 27:47.625
NO? WHY NOT?

27:45.872 --> 27:47.625
NO.

27:47.665 --> 27:50.169
BECAUSE I DECIDED

27:47.665 --> 27:50.169
INSTEAD OF BEING HURT AND UPSET

27:50.210 --> 27:53.671
BY YOUR DISAPPROVAL, I'M GONNA

27:50.210 --> 27:53.671
BE AMUSED. GONNA FIND IT FUNNY.

I'M EVEN GONNA TAKE

27:53.713 --> 27:56.216
A BIT OF PLEASURE IN IT.

27:56.258 --> 27:57.884
YOU TAKE PLEASURE

27:56.258 --> 27:57.884
IN MY DISAPPROVAL?

27:57.926 --> 28:00.304
I ENCOURAGE IT SOMETIMES

27:57.926 --> 28:00.304
JUST FOR A LAUGH.

28:00.346 --> 28:03.223
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK.

28:00.346 --> 28:03.223
THINK "HEY, THAT'S BRILLIANT."

28:03.265 --> 28:05.184
BECAUSE THIS IDEA

28:03.265 --> 28:05.184
COULD SET YOU FREE.

28:06.726 --> 28:08.354
[ SIGHS ]

28:08.395 --> 28:11.190

28:33.045 --> 28:35.589
I THINK<i> I</i> SHOULD. READY?

28:35.631 --> 28:38.091
OKAY. THAT LITTLE STUNT

28:47.685 --> 28:50.437

28:50.479 --> 28:52.981

41:11.761 --> 41:15.014
HOW'D IT FINALLY END

41:11.761 --> 41:15.014
