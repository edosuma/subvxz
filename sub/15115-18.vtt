00:55.976 --> 00:58.819
I WANT YOU TO KNOW
I HAVE BEATEN A MAN
UNCONSCIOUS BEFORE.

00:58.819 --> 01:01.061
SO... A BAD WITCH.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.623
‐ WHO ARE YOU?
GET OFF MY COUCH!
‐ OKAY.

GET OUT OF MY HOUSE.

01:03.944 --> 01:05.866
‐ YES, MA'AM.

01:15.956 --> 01:18.999
MICHELLE WHO?

01:21.201 --> 01:23.684
YOU TOLD HIM WHERE
I KEPT MY KEY?!

01:23.684 --> 01:25.005
OH, YOU'RE KIDDING.

01:25.005 --> 01:26.126
FANNY, YOU'RE BACK.

01:26.126 --> 01:27.848
I'M GONE TWO WEEKS,
I COME BACK

01:27.848 --> 01:29.770
AND YOU'RE IN BED
WITH A CHILD WHO
WEARS FLIP‐FLOPS

01:29.770 --> 01:31.331
‐ IN PUBLIC.
‐ HEY, FANNY.

01:31.331 --> 01:33.814
‐ HELLO, GODOT.
‐ I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE
COMING BACK TODAY.

01:33.814 --> 01:36.016
HOW MANY MEN DO YOU HAVE
STASHED AROUND HERE, HUH?

01:36.016 --> 01:37.578
YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO
COME BACK NEXT WEEK.

01:37.578 --> 01:39.019
‐ OH, IS THAT ME?
‐ THERE'S A MAN IN
MY LIVING ROOM,

01:39.019 --> 01:40.701
‐ A MAN IN YOUR BED.
‐ I WROTE IT DOWN.

01:40.701 --> 01:41.782
WHOA.

01:41.782 --> 01:42.863
IS THERE ONE
IN THE GARAGE?

01:42.863 --> 01:44.024
THREE IN
THE POTTING SHED?

01:44.024 --> 01:45.385
SEE? NEXT WEEK.
THE 20th.

01:45.385 --> 01:46.707
TODAY IS THE 20th.

01:46.707 --> 01:48.148
CRAP. I MISSED MY
DENTIST APPOINTMENT.

01:48.148 --> 01:49.389
WHO WAS THE MAN
IN MY HOUSE?

01:49.389 --> 01:50.791
I DON'T KNOW.

01:50.791 --> 01:52.633
YOU TOLD HIM TO STAY THERE.
YOU SHOWED HIM MY KEY.

01:52.633 --> 01:53.874
‐ I DID?
‐ I'M SORRY.

01:53.874 --> 01:55.315
I THOUGHT SHE
WAS OUT OF TOWN.

01:55.315 --> 01:56.717
‐ SCOTTY?
‐ WHO'S SCOTTY?

01:56.717 --> 01:58.118
‐ I'M SCOTTY.
‐ SCOTTY'S MY BROTHER.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.760
‐ EXCUSE ME.
‐ I THOUGHT YOU LEFT.

01:59.760 --> 02:02.002
I DID LEAVE, BUT I NEEDED
A PLACE TO STAY FOR A FEW DAYS,

02:02.002 --> 02:03.524
AND I DIDN'T WANT
TO BOTHER YOU.

02:03.524 --> 02:05.846
SO YOU BROKE
INTO MY HOUSE LIKE
ROBERT DOWNEY, JR.?

02:05.846 --> 02:07.207
YOU CAN'T JUST COME
IN AND OUT LIKE THIS.

02:07.207 --> 02:08.448
‐ YOU SHOULD GET UP.
‐ I'M KIND OF‐‐

02:08.448 --> 02:10.210
‐ I KNOW. I'M SORRY.
‐ YOU HAVE TO CALL.

02:10.210 --> 02:11.932
‐ I LOST MY PHONE.
‐ WHO LOSES THEIR PHONE?

02:11.932 --> 02:13.293
LOTS OF PEOPLE
LOSE THEIR PHONES.

02:13.293 --> 02:14.855
CAN SOMEONE HAND ME
A TOWEL OR A THROW BLANKET?

02:14.855 --> 02:16.216
MY HOUSE IS NOT A HOSTEL.

02:16.216 --> 02:17.858
IT IS WHERE
I LIVE AND SLEEP.

02:17.858 --> 02:19.940
‐ I DIDN'T KNOW
HE WAS COMING.
‐ <i>A DISHCLOTH MAYBE?</i>

02:19.940 --> 02:21.582
‐ I THINK I LEFT IT IN MONTEREY.
‐ THEN GO BACK AND GET IT.

02:21.582 --> 02:23.143
‐ OH, I'M NOT GOING
BACK TO MONTEREY.
‐ WHY? WHAT'S HER NAME?

02:23.143 --> 02:24.545
‐ WHOSE NAME?
‐ A TEA KETTLE?

02:24.545 --> 02:26.266
WHOEVER IT IS THAT
CHASED HIM OUT OF MONTEREY.

02:26.266 --> 02:28.028
‐ <i>BAKING SHEET?</i>
‐ YOU ARE JUMPING TO
CONCLUSIONS AGAIN.

02:28.028 --> 02:30.631
‐ A SKILLET.
‐ HOW ABOUT SOME PANTS?

02:30.631 --> 02:32.553
BEFORE THE BAKING SHEET
AND THE SKILLET,

02:32.553 --> 02:34.555
HOW ABOUT WE
FIND YOU YOUR PANTS?

02:34.555 --> 02:35.556
PANTS WOULD WORK.

02:35.556 --> 02:36.877
FIND HIS PANTS.

02:36.877 --> 02:38.038
PANTS, PANTS, PANTS.

02:38.038 --> 02:39.039
MAYBE I DON'T
LIKE AQUARIUMS.

02:39.039 --> 02:40.921
OR MONTEREY JACK CHEESE.

02:40.921 --> 02:43.003
MAYBE CHEESE AND AQUARIUMS
ARE WHY I WON'T GO BACK TO
MONTEREY.

02:43.003 --> 02:44.525
‐ <i>DID YOU EVER</i>
<i>THINK OF THAT?</i>
‐ I DON'T SEE ANY PANTS.

02:44.525 --> 02:45.726
LAST NIGHT, YOU SURE
YOU HAD PANTS?

02:45.726 --> 02:47.287
PRETTY SURE.

02:47.287 --> 02:49.009
RETRACE YOUR STEPS.
YOU STARTED THIS WHOLE
THING WHERE?

02:49.009 --> 02:50.691
CAR. WE STARTED
IN THE CAR.

02:50.691 --> 02:52.292
HOW CLASSY.
COME ON.

02:52.292 --> 02:54.294
OUT THERE.

02:54.294 --> 02:56.296
OH, GOT A BELT!

02:57.698 --> 02:59.700
SO, HOW'S
OCEANOGRAPHY GOING?

03:04.985 --> 03:07.027
<i>( theme music playing )</i>

03:34.735 --> 03:35.936
WERE YOU TRYING TO
SPELL IT PROPERLY?

03:35.936 --> 03:38.018
‐ 'CAUSE FANNY HAS TWO "N"s.
‐ AND AN "F."

03:38.018 --> 03:39.620
‐ AND AN "A."
‐ IT'S ALL THERE.
IT'S JUST SURREAL.

03:39.620 --> 03:40.821
GINNY, DON'T TAKE
THIS THE WRONG WAY,

03:40.821 --> 03:43.023
‐ BUT YOU STINK.
‐ OH, I WON'T. THANKS.

03:43.023 --> 03:45.025
I MEAN, YOU WORKED
ON THIS FOR HOURS.

03:45.025 --> 03:46.867
WHAT EXACTLY IS FRANKIE

03:46.867 --> 03:48.869
'CAUSE IT SURE
AIN'T DRAWING.

03:48.869 --> 03:50.230
AND WHAT'S ALL THAT
AT THE BOTTOM THERE?

03:50.230 --> 03:51.952
‐ PEARS.
‐ PEARS?

03:51.952 --> 03:53.113
I'M WORKING
ON STILL LIFES.

03:53.113 --> 03:54.474
I WAS PRACTICING
PEARS.

03:54.474 --> 03:55.876
IS SHE HERE YET?

03:55.876 --> 03:57.397
‐ NOT YET.
‐ GOOD.

03:57.397 --> 03:59.039
I WANT TO SEE HER FACE
WHEN SHE SEES YOU TIED
FLOWERS

03:59.039 --> 04:00.641
TO HER NEWLY
SANDED BARRES.

04:00.641 --> 04:01.882
HOW LOUD DO YOU
THINK THAT'LL BE?

04:01.882 --> 04:03.564

04:03.564 --> 04:06.086
OOH, THAT'S
A BIG BANNER.

04:06.086 --> 04:07.688
WHO'S "TRANNY?"

04:07.688 --> 04:09.770
AND PEOPLE WONDER WHY
VAN GOGH CUT HIS EAR OFF.

04:11.852 --> 04:14.575
‐ ARTISTS ARE SO TEMPERAMENTAL.
‐ SO'S GINNY.

04:15.816 --> 04:17.457

04:17.457 --> 04:20.260
‐ ( applause )
‐ THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

04:21.301 --> 04:24.865
THANK YOU,
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.467
OH, HOW I'VE
MISSED YOU ALL.

04:27.467 --> 04:28.949
I THOUGHT ABOUT YOU DAILY

04:28.949 --> 04:31.271
AS I CHANTED,
AS I MEDITATED,

04:31.271 --> 04:32.873
AS I DRANK
THE SPIRITUAL TEA

04:32.873 --> 04:34.875
THAT OPENED MY
CONSCIOUSNESS.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.356
AND NOW I AM BACK.

04:36.356 --> 04:38.198
AND WE HAVE A LOT
OF WORK TO DO.

04:38.198 --> 04:39.640
WE'LL START CLASS
IN A MINUTE.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.322
SPIRITUAL TEA,
HUH?

04:42.322 --> 04:44.885
COMPLETELY LEGAL.

FANNY, I'M SO
GLAD YOU'RE BACK.

04:46.687 --> 04:47.768
DID YOU HEAR?

04:47.768 --> 04:48.849
I DON'T KNOW,
DID I?

04:48.849 --> 04:50.851
YEAH, I KIND OF
MEANT TO TELL YOU.

04:53.934 --> 04:55.616
‐ WHAT?
‐ YEAH. WEIRDLY,

04:55.616 --> 04:57.177
ONLY BEING OPEN
EIGHT HOURS A WEEK,

04:57.177 --> 04:58.939
NOT ENOUGH TO KEEP
A BUSINESS GOING.
WHO'D HAVE THOUGHT?

04:58.939 --> 05:01.141
‐ TRULY.
‐ NOT YOUR FAULT.

05:01.141 --> 05:02.783
‐ I KNOW.
‐ YOU DID YOUR BEST.

05:02.783 --> 05:05.105
‐ I KNOW.
‐ I TRIED. I FAILED.

05:05.105 --> 05:07.548
HOW COULD YOU
LEAVE THIS OUT?

05:07.548 --> 05:09.309
TRAUMA.
BLACKOUT.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.872
I'M SORRY, TRULY.

05:11.872 --> 05:13.794
DON'T BE.
THAT'S HOW LIFE WORKS.

05:13.794 --> 05:15.876
SOME PEOPLE CAN BE
THE FUNNIEST GUY IN
THE SPORTS BAR,

05:15.876 --> 05:17.638
AND WIND UP HOSTING
A LATE NIGHT TELEVISION SHOW,

05:17.638 --> 05:19.720
AND OTHER PEOPLE ARE ME.
THEY LOSE.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.602
WHATEVER. MOVING ON.
LEMONADE.

05:21.602 --> 05:23.203
‐ WHAT?
‐ <i>I'M MAKING LEMONADE.</i>

05:23.203 --> 05:24.885
FROM LIFE'S LEMONS.

05:24.885 --> 05:26.567
‐ GOT IT.
‐ BUT NOW THAT MY
BUSINESS IS GONE,

05:26.567 --> 05:28.248
I HAVE PLENTY OF TIME
TO REFRESH YOUR WARDROBE.

05:28.248 --> 05:29.850
THESE COSTUMES ARE
IN TERRIBLE SHAPE,

05:29.850 --> 05:30.851
BUT WHEN I GET
DONE WITH THEM,

05:30.851 --> 05:32.452
I WILL STILL BE
A GIGANTIC LOSER

05:32.452 --> 05:34.615
AND THEY WILL
LOOK FANTASTIC.

05:34.615 --> 05:37.017
THERE'S NO
PLACE LIKE HOME.

ALL RIGHT,

WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

05:44.865 --> 05:45.906
OVER TO THE BARRE.

05:45.906 --> 05:47.868
‐ WHY?
‐ I THOUGHT I'D TAKE CLASS.

05:47.868 --> 05:49.950
( chuckles )
YOU'RE KIDDING.

05:49.950 --> 05:51.712
NO.
JUST FOR FUN.

05:51.712 --> 05:52.793
YOU MIND?

05:52.793 --> 05:53.874
I DO NOT MIND.

05:53.874 --> 05:55.475
OKAY, GOOD.

05:55.475 --> 05:56.877
I'LL BE OVER THERE.

05:56.877 --> 05:59.279
<i>( piano music playing )</i>

05:59.279 --> 06:00.881
HOLD ON TO YOUR SOCKS, KID.

06:00.881 --> 06:03.043
YOU'RE GONNA
SEE SOME MOVES.

06:03.043 --> 06:05.726

06:23.263 --> 06:24.945
THAT'S RIGHT.
I AM WORKING.

06:24.945 --> 06:26.266
FANNY ASKED ME TO
HELP OUT A LITTLE
AROUND HERE,

06:26.266 --> 06:27.467
AND I SAID SURE.

06:27.467 --> 06:28.549
‐ SHE ASKED?
‐ YEAH.

06:28.549 --> 06:30.711
‐ DID SHE ASK NICELY?
‐ VERY NICELY.

06:30.711 --> 06:32.032
DID SHE SAY
"PLEASE, SCOTTY,

06:32.032 --> 06:33.874
WOULD YOU BE SO KIND
AS TO HELP ME

06:33.874 --> 06:35.395

THERE'LL BE ICED TEA

FROM THE OLD COUNTRY."

06:37.277 --> 06:38.879
IN A VERY DIFFERENT
SET OF WORDS, YES.

06:38.879 --> 06:40.480
YOU WANT ME TO TALK
TO HER AND NEGOTIATE
YOUR RELEASE?

06:40.480 --> 06:42.963
NO, I'M FINE. IN EXCHANGE
FOR ME CRASHING ON HER COUCH,

06:42.963 --> 06:44.484
I'M DOING SOME CHORES.
SEEMS FAIR.

06:44.484 --> 06:45.726
VERY FAIR.

06:45.726 --> 06:47.487
I MEAN, A LITTLE HARD
WORK'S GOOD FOR A MAN.

06:47.487 --> 06:48.969
FOR A MAN, SURE.

06:48.969 --> 06:50.811
HEY, I'M THE SON
OF A LABORER, SO
IT'S IN MY BLOOD.

06:50.811 --> 06:52.533
YEAH, WE DON'T KNOW
FOR SURE THAT YOU'RE
THE SON OF A LABORER.

06:52.533 --> 06:54.695
‐ DAD WAS A LABORER.
‐ MY DAD WAS A LABORER.

06:54.695 --> 06:56.016
WE HAVE THE SAME DAD.

06:56.016 --> 06:57.097
( chuckles )
OKAY.

06:57.097 --> 06:59.459
‐ WE HAVE THE SAME NOSE.
‐ BACK TO WORK.

07:12.713 --> 07:14.274
OKAY.

07:14.274 --> 07:16.476
WHAT WEIRD PLACE ARE
YOU WATCHING ME FROM?

07:16.476 --> 07:18.038

NOW GIVE ME.

I JUST WANT
TO GO ON RECORD

07:39.620 --> 07:40.861

‐ I'M GONNA READ IT.

07:45.105 --> 07:46.867
YOU CAN TURN AROUND
IF YOU WANT.

07:46.867 --> 07:48.268
SHOULD WE TALK
ABOUT IT FIRST?

07:48.268 --> 07:49.870
NOPE.

‐ SHH.

I'VE NEVER
HEARD OF THIS.

DO YOU READ
ANYTHING RUSSIAN?

08:02.282 --> 08:04.044
PUSSY RIOT'S
LINER NOTES.

08:04.044 --> 08:06.046
IN RUSSIAN SOCIETY,
A MAN WOULD OFTEN

08:06.046 --> 08:07.487
SHOW A WOMAN HIS DIARIES
SO SHE WOULD KNOW

08:07.487 --> 08:09.289
OF HIS PAST
INTIMATE RELATIONS.

I DON'T‐‐

WHAT DOES THIS SAY?

08:16.256 --> 08:18.699

"BATHROOM."

08:18.699 --> 08:19.860
UPSTAIRS BATHROOM?

08:19.860 --> 08:21.862
YES.
UPSTAIRS BATHROOM.

08:21.862 --> 08:22.863
VERY ROMANTIC.

08:22.863 --> 08:24.104
OKAY, SERIOUSLY.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.626
HOLD ON.

08:25.626 --> 08:27.187
( sighs )

08:30.871 --> 08:32.873
‐ THIS IS ALL OF IT?
‐ YES.

08:32.873 --> 08:34.194
AND IT'S ALL TRUE?

08:34.194 --> 08:35.876
SASHA, SERIOUSLY?

08:35.876 --> 08:37.437
( sighs )

08:37.437 --> 08:38.879
YES, IT'S ALL TRUE.

08:38.879 --> 08:40.881
IT'S 100% TRUE, OKAY?

08:43.884 --> 08:45.365
OKAY.

08:45.365 --> 08:46.647
THANK YOU.

08:46.647 --> 08:47.888
YOU'RE WELCOME.

08:47.888 --> 08:49.049
<i>DOSVEEDANYA.</i>

08:53.293 --> 08:55.295
( sighs )

08:55.295 --> 08:56.897
I COULDN'T DATE
A CHEERLEADER.

09:02.743 --> 09:04.825
BOY, HE HAD A VERY
ACTIVE EIGHTH GRADE.

09:04.825 --> 09:06.747
WAS THIS WHEN JENNY DIVUCIO
WAS FAT OR THIN?

09:06.747 --> 09:07.828
‐ FAT.
‐ WOW.

09:07.828 --> 09:09.069
AT LEAST HE'S
NOT SHALLOW.

09:09.069 --> 09:09.990
YOU THINK
IT'S ALL TRUE?

09:09.990 --> 09:12.072
I'D SAY IT'S
60 TO 65% TRUE.

09:12.072 --> 09:13.754
THE LEMONADE GIRLS AT
HOT DOG ON A STICK STORY

09:13.754 --> 09:15.275
SMACKS A BIT
OF HOWARD STERN.

09:15.275 --> 09:17.397
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO
WITH ALL THIS INFORMATION
ANYHOW?

09:17.397 --> 09:18.839
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY,
KNOWLEDGE IS POWER.

09:18.839 --> 09:20.921
YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE THEY SAY?
THAT WAS NOT AN ANSWER.

09:20.921 --> 09:23.083
RIDICULOUS. THIS IS NOT
WHAT WE ASKED FOR, BOO.

09:23.083 --> 09:24.484
AND FRANKLY,
I DON'T APPRECIATE

09:24.484 --> 09:26.006
CARL NOT TAKING
IT SERIOUSLY.

09:26.006 --> 09:27.848
‐ I THINK IT'S CUTE.
‐ WE ASKED HIM‐‐

09:27.848 --> 09:29.249
YOU ASKED HIM

09:29.249 --> 09:31.251
FOR A FULL ACCOUNTING OF ALL
OF HIS INTIMATE EXPERIENCES,

09:31.251 --> 09:32.853
‐ AND HE GIVES YOU THIS.
‐ SO?

09:32.853 --> 09:34.094
‐ IT'S A COMIC BOOK.
‐ <i>( bell dings )</i>

09:34.094 --> 09:35.856
MY POT ROAST IS READY.

09:35.856 --> 09:37.778
REMEMBER
THE JIFFY POP DAYS?

09:37.778 --> 09:39.019
WE WERE JUST
KIDS BACK THEN.

09:39.019 --> 09:41.061
IT'S NOT A COMIC BOOK.
IT'S A GRAPHIC NOVEL.

09:41.061 --> 09:43.463
<i>THIS IS NOT A LIST.</i>
<i>WE ASKED FOR A LIST.</i>

09:43.463 --> 09:45.025
WELL, HE THOUGHT THIS
WOULD BE MORE CREATIVE.

09:45.025 --> 09:46.867
NO ONE'S EVEN
HUMAN IN IT.

09:46.867 --> 09:48.068
YEAH, WHICH ANIMAL'S
SUPPOSED TO BE CARL?

09:48.068 --> 09:49.189
THE MUSKRAT IN
THE JOGGING SUIT.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.711
<i>IT'S NOT EVEN ABOUT DATING.</i>

09:50.711 --> 09:52.993
ON PAGE FIVE, THE MUSKRAT TAKES
THE SLOW BOAT TO CHINA.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.755
GOD, THAT SMELLS DELICIOUS.

09:54.755 --> 09:56.156
THERE'S THREE HEADS
OF GARLIC IN THERE.

09:56.156 --> 09:57.678
GOOD THING WE DON'T
HAVE BOYFRIENDS.

09:57.678 --> 09:58.999
WE'RE GONNA
REEK FOR A MONTH.

09:58.999 --> 10:01.161
YOU KNOW, THE DRAWINGS
ARE PRETTY GOOD HERE, BOO.

10:01.161 --> 10:02.923
MAYBE I SHOULD TRY
A DIFFERENT STYLE OF ART.

10:02.923 --> 10:04.044
YOU THINK CARL COULD
GIVE ME SOME TIPS?

10:04.044 --> 10:05.485
YOU CHEATING ON
YOUR ART TEACHER?

10:05.485 --> 10:06.847
JUST TRYING TO
KEEP HIM INTERESTED.

10:06.847 --> 10:08.529
MY PEARS SURE
AREN'T DOING IT.

10:08.529 --> 10:11.091
YEAH, I KNOW HOW
THAT SOUNDED AND
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

10:11.091 --> 10:13.774
THIS IS YOUR
RELATIONSHIP, BOO.

10:13.774 --> 10:15.055
‐ <i>DON'T YOU CARE?</i>
‐ ABOUT WHAT?

10:15.055 --> 10:16.657
ABOUT THE THINGS
CARL'S DONE.

10:16.657 --> 10:17.858
NO, NOT REALLY.

10:17.858 --> 10:19.339
BUT WHAT HE'S DONE
AFFECTS YOU.

10:19.339 --> 10:21.461
‐ HOW?
‐ WHAT IF YOU'RE NOT
EXPERIENCED ENOUGH, HUH?

10:21.461 --> 10:23.303
<i>THAT CAN RUIN</i>
<i>SOME RELATIONSHIPS.</i>

10:23.303 --> 10:26.066
I'M NOT EXPERIENCED ENOUGH.
IT SEEMS TO BE FINE SO FAR.

10:26.066 --> 10:27.748
YEAH, HOW EXPERIENCED YOU ARE
DOESN'T MATTER TO A LOT OF GUYS.

10:27.748 --> 10:28.909
WHAT IF HE'S GOT A KID?

10:28.909 --> 10:30.150
CARL DOESN'T HAVE A KID.

10:30.150 --> 10:31.752
HE DOESN'T EVEN
HAVE A BIKE.

10:31.752 --> 10:32.913
SO MAYBE IT'S NOT A KID,

10:32.913 --> 10:34.835
BUT IT COULD BE
A MYRIAD OF OTHER THINGS,

10:34.835 --> 10:36.997
AND I FIND IT ASTONISHING
THAT I'M THE ONLY PERSON
IN THIS ROOM

10:36.997 --> 10:38.759
WHO COMPREHENDS
HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS.

10:38.759 --> 10:40.480
‐ <i>( bell dings )</i>
‐ MY POPOVERS ARE READY.

10:45.886 --> 10:47.888
<i>( TV playing )</i>

10:52.933 --> 10:55.776
‐ SASHA?
‐ YEAH?

10:55.776 --> 10:57.698
I KNOW YOU'RE MAD
ABOUT THE COMIC BOOK,

10:57.698 --> 11:00.100
BUT CAN I BRING CARL
A PIECE OF PIE?

11:00.100 --> 11:02.102
I THOUGHT IT WAS
A GRAPHIC NOVEL.

11:03.944 --> 11:05.225
I'M NOT MAD.

11:05.225 --> 11:06.226
TAKE HIM PIE.

11:09.750 --> 11:11.992
OH, SHOOT!
WE WERE SUPPOSED TO DO

11:11.992 --> 11:13.233
THE FACE MASKS TONIGHT.

11:13.233 --> 11:15.235
WE'LL DO IT NEXT TIME.

11:15.235 --> 11:17.678
I WAS REALLY LOOKING
FORWARD TO A HEALTHY
YOUTHFUL GLOW.

11:20.240 --> 11:21.922
OKAY, COME ON.

11:21.922 --> 11:23.924
REALLY?

11:23.924 --> 11:25.325
SHOULD WE WAKE THEM?

11:25.325 --> 11:26.767
THEY LOOK YOUTHFUL
ENOUGH TO ME.

11:28.929 --> 11:31.171
YOU KNOW, I READ THAT
FRENCH WOMEN DON'T GO
TO THE GYM.

11:31.171 --> 11:32.492
THEY JUST USE
WEIGHT LOSS CREAM.

11:32.492 --> 11:33.854
SOUNDS RIDICULOUS.

11:33.854 --> 11:35.415
YEAH, BUT IT'D BE
NICE IF IT WORKED.

11:38.018 --> 11:39.499
BOO...

11:39.499 --> 11:40.541
I THINK WE NEED
TO STEP IT UP.

11:40.541 --> 11:41.782
STEP WHAT UP?

11:41.782 --> 11:44.144
I THINK WE NEED TO
CONSIDER HAVING SEX NOW.

11:44.144 --> 11:46.346
WITH EACH OTHER?

11:46.346 --> 11:47.427
NO, WITH ROMAN AND CARL.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.551
ME WITH ROMAN,
YOU WITH CARL.

11:50.551 --> 11:52.152
BUT CARL AND I
ARE WAITING.

11:52.152 --> 11:54.314
A YEAR AND A HALF
IS A LONG TIME.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.156
TIME THAT INCLUDES DANCES,

11:56.156 --> 11:57.397
PARTIES.

11:57.397 --> 11:58.999
FRIDAY NIGHT PARTIES
THAT HE CAN GO TO

11:58.999 --> 12:01.321
AND YOU CAN'T BECAUSE
YOU HAVE CLASS IN THE MORNING.

12:01.321 --> 12:02.923
<i>AND THERE'S GIRLS</i>
<i>AT THESE PARTIES.</i>

12:02.923 --> 12:04.084
PARTY GIRLS.

12:04.084 --> 12:05.205
<i>THAT TIME ALSO</i>
<i>INCLUDES CAMP.</i>

12:05.205 --> 12:06.567
SIX WEEKS WHERE
YOU'RE APART.

12:06.567 --> 12:07.928
AND HE'LL BE A JUNIOR
COUNSELOR THIS YEAR.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.369
HE'LL WEAR
THE GRAY SHORTS.

12:09.369 --> 12:10.931
<i>HE'LL BE DOING</i>
<i>BED CHECKS.</i>

12:10.931 --> 12:13.053
<i>HE'LL HAVE PRIVILEGES,</i>
<i>POWER.</i>

12:13.053 --> 12:15.375
THAT'S A BIG TURN‐ON
TO A LOT OF GIRLS.

12:15.375 --> 12:17.097
‐ I KNOW.
‐ <i>PLUS, IN A YEAR AND A HALF</i>

12:17.097 --> 12:18.779
YOU'RE NOT THE NEW
GIRLFRIEND ANYMORE.

12:18.779 --> 12:19.940
YOU'RE JUST THE OLD GIRLFRIEND
WHO MADE HIM WAIT

12:19.940 --> 12:21.421
A YEAR AND A HALF.

12:21.421 --> 12:22.943
YOU'RE PLANNING ON
DOING IT WITH HIM ANYHOW,

12:22.943 --> 12:24.745
SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
IF YOU JUST MOVE IT UP A BIT?

12:24.745 --> 12:27.147
YOU'RE READY?
WITH ROMAN?

12:27.147 --> 12:28.308
I THINK TIMING
IS IMPORTANT.

12:28.308 --> 12:30.070
WE SHOULD STRIKE WHILE
THE IRON IS HOT.

12:30.070 --> 12:31.912
BUT WHAT DO WE DO?

12:31.912 --> 12:33.994
HOW DO WE WORK THIS?
I NEED TO SHAVE MY LEGS.

12:33.994 --> 12:35.996
HEY. WHAT ARE
YOU GUYS DOING?

12:35.996 --> 12:38.318
WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE SEX.

12:38.318 --> 12:39.960
HOW LONG WERE
WE ASLEEP?

12:39.960 --> 12:42.322
BOO AND I MADE
SOME DECISIONS TONIGHT
REGARDING OUR FUTURE,

12:42.322 --> 12:43.844
AND TOMORROW WE'LL START
PUTTING A PLAN IN MOTION.

12:43.844 --> 12:45.646
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

12:45.646 --> 12:47.167
WE'LL START WITH RESEARCH.
WHAT TIME CAN WE ALL MEET
AT THE LIBRARY?

12:47.167 --> 12:49.089
ALL? YOU'RE
THE HORNDOGS.

12:49.089 --> 12:51.011
WE'VE GOT POTENTIAL
SPINSTER BUDDY COMEDY

12:51.011 --> 12:52.332
WRITTEN ALL OVER
OUR FACES.

12:52.332 --> 12:53.934
THIS ISN'T
ABOUT BOYFRIENDS.

12:53.934 --> 12:55.576
THIS IS ABOUT INFORMATION.

12:55.576 --> 12:57.177
WE ARE YOUNG WOMEN
IN A FRANTIC TIME,

12:57.177 --> 12:58.458
AND WE GROW UP QUICKLY.

12:58.458 --> 13:00.020
<i>WE NEED TO BE</i>
<i>READY FOR ANYTHING.</i>

13:00.020 --> 13:01.381
<i>IGNORANCE IS NOT BLISS.</i>

I'M AN INTELLIGENT WOMAN

13:03.343 --> 13:04.785
HAVE IGNORANT FRIENDS.

13:04.785 --> 13:06.346

I NEED THAT AMPHITHEATER
DONE FOR THE FALL RECITAL.

14:54.735 --> 14:56.096
WELL, I'M SORRY.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.018
BEN WAS TOO
STUPID TO LIVE.

14:58.018 --> 14:59.740
WHEN I FIND MYSELF
ACTING OUT SIMPLE
COMMANDS

14:59.740 --> 15:01.101
LIKE "YOU PUT
BIG THING THERE,"

15:01.101 --> 15:02.342
THEY HAVE TO GO.

15:02.342 --> 15:03.944
I'LL FIND ANOTHER
CONCRETE GUY.

15:03.944 --> 15:05.946
‐ FINE.
‐ THIS IS WHY THEY HAD
PLAGUES, YOU KNOW.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.588
TO KILL DUMB GUYS
LIKE BEN.

15:07.588 --> 15:08.949
<i>YOU KNOW WHAT YOU</i>
<i>HAVE TO DO, MILLY?</i>

LIKE WHAT?

15:11.832 --> 15:13.193
WHAT DO YOU MEAN "LIKE WHAT?"
SHE'S YOUR SISTER.

15:13.193 --> 15:15.035
‐ SHE'S A WRECK.
‐ WHY?

15:15.035 --> 15:17.317
SHE'S DEVASTATED ABOUT
SPARKLES GOING DOWN.

15:17.317 --> 15:19.319
OH, WELL I'M NOT SURE
WHAT I CAN DO ABOUT THAT.

15:19.319 --> 15:20.921
REALLY?

15:20.921 --> 15:22.402
WELL, LET'S
THINK ABOUT THAT.

15:22.402 --> 15:24.004
WHAT COULD YOU DO?

15:24.004 --> 15:26.727
WHAT COULD YOU DO
TO HELP YOUR SISTER,

15:26.727 --> 15:28.088
WHO USED TO
HAVE A BUSINESS

15:28.088 --> 15:29.930
AND NOW DOESN'T
HAVE A BUSINESS

15:29.930 --> 15:31.652
AND IS SITTING
IN THE MIDDLE
OF MY BUSINESS

15:31.652 --> 15:33.814
‐ DOING THAT?
‐ <i>BOY, THAT'S</i>
<i>REALLY UPSETTING.</i>

15:33.814 --> 15:35.175
Fanny: <i>SHE MISSES SPARKLES.</i>

15:35.175 --> 15:36.216
Milly: <i>SO SHE NEEDS WORK.</i>

15:36.216 --> 15:38.098
‐ WELL...
‐ I TRIED THAT ONCE.

15:38.098 --> 15:40.100
I GOT HER A JOB ON
AN ASSEMBLY LINE.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.502
TOTAL DISASTER.

15:41.502 --> 15:43.504
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
AN ASSEMBLY LINE.

15:43.504 --> 15:45.185
ALL SHE HAD TO DO
WAS SCREW ON A NUT.

15:45.185 --> 15:47.988
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT
AN ASSEMBLY LINE, MILLY.

15:47.988 --> 15:49.990
Milly: <i>SHE'S USELESS ON</i>
<i>A LOADING DOCK TOO, FYI.</i>

15:49.990 --> 15:52.272
WELL, MAYBE IF YOU
THINK REAL HARD

15:52.272 --> 15:53.754
YOU'LL COME UP
WITH SOMETHING.

15:53.754 --> 15:55.516
I WONDER HOW SHE'D BE
AT POURING CONCRETE.

15:55.516 --> 15:56.677
HEY, SORRY.

15:56.677 --> 15:58.078
I DIDN'T KNOW
THE PLACE WAS PACKED.

15:58.078 --> 15:59.239
WHAT DO YOU NEED?

15:59.239 --> 16:00.480
OH, NOTHING.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.563
YOU'RE DRESSED
IN DANCE CLOTHES.

16:02.563 --> 16:03.724
YEAH, I AM.

16:03.724 --> 16:05.005
I WAS FEELING
A LITTLE BLOATY

16:05.005 --> 16:06.486
SO I THOUGHT I'D
SPIN AROUND A LITTLE.

16:06.486 --> 16:08.408
SEE IF I COULD
FLING IT OFF

16:08.408 --> 16:09.730
OR SOMETHING.

16:09.730 --> 16:11.331
CHARMING.
I'M DONE.

16:11.331 --> 16:13.894
LET'S GO, LADIES.
MICHELLE NEEDS THE STUDIO.

16:13.894 --> 16:15.095
<i>IT'S ALL YOURS.</i>

16:15.095 --> 16:16.897
TRY AND FLING IT
AWAY FROM THE MIRROR

16:16.897 --> 16:17.898
IF POSSIBLE.

16:17.898 --> 16:18.899
WILL DO.

16:22.022 --> 16:23.423
THE TUTUS HATE ME.

16:23.423 --> 16:25.105
THEY DON'T HATE YOU.

16:25.105 --> 16:26.106
Truly: <i>THEY KNOW I FAILED.</i>

16:26.106 --> 16:27.988
<i>( chatter continues )</i>

16:40.400 --> 16:41.481
( sighs )

16:47.407 --> 16:48.569
OKAY.

16:48.569 --> 16:50.010
OKAY.

16:50.010 --> 16:52.012
<i>( door opens )</i>

16:52.012 --> 16:53.574
AHA! I'VE BEEN
LOOKING FOR YOU.

16:53.574 --> 16:54.895
DO YOU HAVE A MINUTE?

16:54.895 --> 16:56.577
ACTUALLY, I'M HEADING
OVER TO FANNY'S.

16:56.577 --> 16:58.739
OKAY, THEN I'D LIKE
TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT.

16:58.739 --> 17:01.021
‐ HOW'S SUNDAY?
‐ APPOINTMENT TO‐‐?

17:01.021 --> 17:03.223
TALK. ABOUT SEX.

17:04.585 --> 17:06.747
ON A SUNDAY?
IS THAT LEGAL?

17:06.747 --> 17:08.268
I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T
MEAN SEX EXACTLY

17:08.268 --> 17:09.590
LIKE "SEX" SEX.

17:09.590 --> 17:10.591
OH, GOOD.

17:10.591 --> 17:11.832
‐ I KNOW ABOUT SEX.
‐ GREAT.

17:11.832 --> 17:13.594
IT'S MORE LIKE
THE MECHANICS OF SEX.

17:13.594 --> 17:15.275
YOU KNOW, NOT
WHAT GOES WHERE.

17:15.275 --> 17:17.277
I'M UP ON THAT.
PENIS, VAGINA,
BLAH BLAH BLAH.

17:17.277 --> 17:18.438
BORING.

17:18.438 --> 17:19.680
I JUST HAVE QUESTIONS,
YOU KNOW?

17:19.680 --> 17:21.041
THINGS TO
TALK THROUGH.

17:21.041 --> 17:22.482
( sighs )

17:22.482 --> 17:25.405
BOY, THERE ARE A LOT
OF BALLS HANGING FROM
THIS CEILING.

17:25.405 --> 17:27.688
SEE, I ALWAYS
WANTED A DOG

17:27.688 --> 17:28.889
FROM THE TIME I WAS FIVE.

17:28.889 --> 17:30.490
BUT I DECIDED,
"IF I'M GONNA OWN A DOG,

17:30.490 --> 17:31.572
I'M GONNA
DO IT PROPERLY."

17:31.572 --> 17:32.653
<i>SO I BOUGHT A LOT OF BOOKS,</i>

17:32.653 --> 17:34.575
AND I WENT TO SHELTERS
AND DOG PARKS

17:34.575 --> 17:36.577
AND I BOUGHT MORE BOOKS,
AND I READ ALL THE BOOKS,

17:36.577 --> 17:38.619
AND I DOG SAT,
AND I MADE LISTS OF NAMES‐‐

17:38.619 --> 17:40.060
AND YOU NEVER GOT
A DOG, DID YOU?

17:40.060 --> 17:42.703
NO. BECAUSE I OVER‐
INTELLECTUALIZE, YOU KNOW?

17:42.703 --> 17:43.984
NO. NO, I DON'T.

17:43.984 --> 17:45.586
<i>I CAN'T BE ALONE</i>
<i>WITH LISTS ANYMORE.</i>

17:45.586 --> 17:47.187
I NEED INTERACTION.
DEBATE.

17:47.187 --> 17:49.349
SO HOW'S SUNDAY,
4:00?

17:49.349 --> 17:50.991
OH, WELL I DON'T
HAVE MY...

17:50.991 --> 17:53.193
THING WITH THE DAY
NUMBERS ON IT.

17:53.193 --> 17:54.915
4:30? 5:00?

17:54.915 --> 17:57.678
SURE. 5:00.
PENCIL ME IN.

17:57.678 --> 17:59.840
‐ THANKS, MICHELLE.
‐ YEAH, SO...

17:59.840 --> 18:01.441
‐ MONDAY AT 4:00.
‐ SUNDAY AT 5:00.

18:01.441 --> 18:02.523
EVEN BETTER.

18:04.124 --> 18:05.566
( groans )
STUPID MULCH.

18:05.566 --> 18:08.408
HEY, I THINK THE PLANTS
GO INSIDE THE POTS.

18:08.408 --> 18:10.170
YEAH, HOW HELPFUL.
THANKS FOR STOPPING BY.

18:10.170 --> 18:11.972
Scotty: <i>HELP ME OUT OVER HERE.</i>

18:13.413 --> 18:15.255
SCOTTY IS ALSO
GREAT AT DRYWALL

18:15.255 --> 18:17.578
AND ANYTHING INVOLVING
HOT TAR, FYI.

18:17.578 --> 18:19.419
I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND.

18:19.419 --> 18:20.981
OOH, GONNA
BE A DJ?

18:20.981 --> 18:23.183
I HAVE THE CHOREOGRAPHY
FOR THE RECITAL

18:23.183 --> 18:24.505
ALL WORKED OUT
IN MY HEAD,

18:24.505 --> 18:25.586
BUT I CAN'T FIND
THE RIGHT MUSIC.

18:25.586 --> 18:27.988
I HATE WHEN
THAT HAPPENS.

18:27.988 --> 18:29.590
LISTEN, I NEED
SATURDAY OFF.

18:29.590 --> 18:30.911
WHY?

18:30.911 --> 18:32.953
I'M A MULE FOR THE CARTEL.
SATURDAY'S MY SHIFT.

18:32.953 --> 18:34.274
ANYTHING WRONG?

18:34.274 --> 18:35.275
NO. I JUST NEED
THE DAY OFF.

18:35.275 --> 18:36.597
OKAY.

18:36.597 --> 18:37.998
THANKS.

18:37.998 --> 18:39.439
IT'S NOT GONNA BE
A REGULAR THING.

18:42.442 --> 18:44.605
‐ HEY, FANNY?
‐ HMM?

18:44.605 --> 18:47.728
WHAT DO YOU SAY WHEN
THE GIRLS ASK YOU ABOUT SEX?

18:47.728 --> 18:49.730
THEY NEVER
ASK ME ABOUT SEX.

18:49.730 --> 18:51.451
‐ OH.
‐ WHY?

18:51.451 --> 18:53.413
‐ NO REASON.
‐ DID THEY ASK
YOU ABOUT SEX?

18:53.413 --> 18:54.575
JUST MAKING
CONVERSATION.

18:54.575 --> 18:56.817
JUST MAKING
CONVERSATION?

18:56.817 --> 18:58.899
"WHAT DO YOU SAY WHEN
THE GIRLS ASK YOU ABOUT SEX?"

18:58.899 --> 19:00.420
THAT'S JUST MAKING
CONVERSATION?

19:00.420 --> 19:02.422
‐ YES.
‐ "HOW'S THE WEATHER?"

19:02.422 --> 19:03.904
THAT'S JUST MAKING
CONVERSATION.

19:03.904 --> 19:05.986
‐ FINE.
‐ "WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE TASTE OF TOMATOES?"

19:05.986 --> 19:07.668
THAT'S JUST MAKING
CONVERSATION.

19:07.668 --> 19:09.429
‐ SORRY I BROUGHT IT UP.
‐ SOMEONE ASKED YOU ABOUT SEX.

19:09.429 --> 19:11.792
‐ WHO WAS IT?
‐ NO ONE. I WAS JUST
TALKING HYPOTHETICALLY.

19:11.792 --> 19:13.634
MICHELLE,
TELL ME WHO IT WAS.

19:13.634 --> 19:15.916
NO ONE, I SWEAR.
I WAS JUST WATCHING
A MORNING SHOW

19:15.916 --> 19:16.997
<i>AND THERE WAS</i>
<i>A DOCTOR ON</i>

19:16.997 --> 19:18.438
<i>TALKING ABOUT</i>
<i>GIRLS AND SEX.</i>

19:18.438 --> 19:19.479
WHAT SHOW?

19:19.479 --> 19:21.281
YOU KNOW, THE SHOW
WITH THE DOCTOR

19:21.281 --> 19:22.803
WHO WAS TALKING
ABOUT GIRLS AND SEX.

19:22.803 --> 19:24.565
I LOVE THAT SHOW.

19:24.565 --> 19:25.806
ANYHOW, I JUST THOUGHT
I SHOULD BE READY

19:25.806 --> 19:27.608
JUST IN CASE ONE DAY
SOME GIRL CAME UP TO ME

19:27.608 --> 19:28.649
AND ASKED ME ABOUT SEX.

19:28.649 --> 19:30.330
<i>SO, OKAY.</i>
<i>THEY HAVEN'T ASKED YOU.</i>

19:30.330 --> 19:32.613
AND IF THEY HAVEN'T ASKED YOU,
THEY PROBABLY DON'T CARE.

19:32.613 --> 19:33.854
<i>WHICH IS GOOD.</i>

19:33.854 --> 19:35.736
WOW. LOOK AT THE TIME.

19:35.736 --> 19:37.578
I GOTTA GO.
GOOD LUCK WITH
THE MUSIC SEARCH.

19:37.578 --> 19:38.579
THANKS FOR SATURDAY.

19:41.582 --> 19:42.983
<i>( door closes )</i>

19:44.585 --> 19:45.986
WAITING FOR A CALL?

19:45.986 --> 19:47.427
‐ NO.
‐ VERY BELIEVABLE.

19:47.427 --> 19:48.989
HEY, ANYBODY ELSE GET THIS?

19:48.989 --> 19:50.591
‐ WHAT?
‐ MICHELLE'S NOT
TEACHING TODAY.

19:50.591 --> 19:51.832
I GOT THE SAME TEXT.
SHE'S SICK.

19:51.832 --> 19:52.873
SO WHO'S TEACHING?
FANNY?

19:52.873 --> 19:54.595
( crying )

19:54.595 --> 19:55.836
All: JORDAN.

19:55.836 --> 19:57.277
‐ PASS.
‐ MY HOUSE?

19:57.277 --> 19:58.679
‐ STOP FOR TACOS?
‐ I'LL MAKE ZITI.

19:58.679 --> 20:00.681
HEY. I THOUGHT
SHE WAS SICK.

20:00.681 --> 20:02.362
SHE DOESN'T
LOOK SICK.

20:02.362 --> 20:04.444
Melanie: <i>SHE'S GOT A LOT OF</i>
<i>STUFF IN THAT BAG OF HERS.</i>

20:04.444 --> 20:05.646
Ginny: <i>SHE'S NOT TAKING</i>
<i>OFF AGAIN, IS SHE?</i>

20:05.646 --> 20:07.007
NO, NOT AGAIN.

20:11.972 --> 20:13.574
I THINK.

20:13.574 --> 20:15.015
<i>( engine starting )</i>

20:33.634 --> 20:34.955
COME ON.

20:34.955 --> 20:36.597
‐ WHERE ARE WE GOING?
‐ THELMA, LOUISE, LOUISE,

20:36.597 --> 20:38.438
IT'S TIME FOR
A ROAD TRIP.

21:03.744 --> 21:05.746
SORRY.
EXCUSE ME.

21:05.746 --> 21:06.827
UNION? NON‐UNION?

21:06.827 --> 21:07.828
UNION.

21:07.828 --> 21:08.829
EQUITY CARD.

21:08.829 --> 21:10.070
YES.

21:10.070 --> 21:11.271
I ALMOST
FORGOT IT.

21:11.271 --> 21:12.432
THAT WOULD HAVE
BEEN TRAGIC.

21:12.432 --> 21:13.754
FOR ME. YOU I ASSUME

21:13.754 --> 21:14.915
COULD WITHSTAND
SUCH A BLOW.

21:14.915 --> 21:16.276
BREAK A LEG.

21:16.276 --> 21:17.357
IF ANYONE CAN.

21:20.280 --> 21:21.682
UNION?
NON‐UNION?

21:23.283 --> 21:24.444
SORRY.
EXCUSE ME.

21:24.444 --> 21:25.686
PARDON ME.

21:25.686 --> 21:26.847
SORRY.
EXCUSE ME.

21:26.847 --> 21:28.088
COMING THROUGH.
BEEP BEEP.

21:28.088 --> 21:29.449
EXCUSE ME.
THANK YOU.

21:30.931 --> 21:32.653
( quietly )
EXCUSE ME.

21:33.854 --> 21:35.415
EXCUSE ME.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

21:35.415 --> 21:36.817
SORRY.
SORRY SORRY SORRY.

21:36.817 --> 21:38.659
SORRY. SORRY.
EXCUSE ME.

21:38.659 --> 21:40.220

THANK YOU.

21:41.822 --> 21:43.223
GOD. OKAY.

21:43.223 --> 21:44.665
WOW.

21:44.665 --> 21:46.226
HERE WE GO.

21:46.226 --> 21:48.669
AY YI YI.

21:48.669 --> 21:50.671
ALL RIGHT.

21:50.671 --> 21:52.232
( sighs )

21:58.679 --> 22:00.240
( blows raspberry )

22:14.014 --> 22:16.657
OH, THANK GOD WE ARE
FINALLY OUT OF THAT CAR.

22:16.657 --> 22:18.498
IF WE'RE GONNA TRAIL
SOMEONE ALL THE WAY
TO L. A. AGAIN,

22:18.498 --> 22:19.900
YOU HAVE GOT TO GET
A BETTER SOUND SYSTEM.

22:19.900 --> 22:21.662
LOOK AROUND.
SHE PULLED INTO
THE PARKING LOT.

22:21.662 --> 22:22.983
‐ WHERE ARE WE?
‐ CHURCH?

22:22.983 --> 22:24.184
WE'RE AT CHURCH?

22:24.184 --> 22:25.906
WE DROVE AN HOUR
AND A HALF TO GO
TO CHURCH?!

22:25.906 --> 22:27.668
MY GRANDMOTHER'S
GONNA HAVE A STROKE.

22:27.668 --> 22:28.909
MAYBE WE'RE IN
THE WRONG PLACE.

22:28.909 --> 22:30.511
I CAN'T IMAGINE
MICHELLE BEING‐‐

22:40.080 --> 22:41.682
WOW. SO CLOSE.

22:41.682 --> 22:43.003
WAIT, ARE WE SUPPOSED
TO BE HIDING?

22:43.003 --> 22:44.084
I'M UNCLEAR
ON THE AGENDA.

22:44.084 --> 22:45.245
THE AGENDA'S
STILL EVOLVING.

22:45.245 --> 22:46.527
SHOULDN'T WE
GO SAY HI?

22:46.527 --> 22:47.848
‐ WHY?
‐ DIDN'T WE COME
TO SAY HI?

22:47.848 --> 22:49.089
‐ NO.
‐ WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

22:49.089 --> 22:50.851
USING MY POWERS FOR
GOOD INSTEAD OF EVIL.

22:50.851 --> 22:51.852
WHAT'S THE NAME
OF THIS PLACE?

22:51.852 --> 22:53.854
HOLLYWOOD UNITED
METHODIST CHURCH.

22:53.854 --> 22:55.015
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE.

22:55.015 --> 22:56.016
YOU'LL BE HOME
BEFORE DARK.

22:56.016 --> 22:57.257
NO, I MEAN
I'M LUTHERAN.

22:57.257 --> 22:58.659
I GOT IT.

22:58.659 --> 23:00.581
‐ IT'S AN AUDITION.
‐ FOR WHAT, "SISTER ACT"?

23:00.581 --> 23:03.063
IT'S "FOR AN OPEN CALL
FOR DANCERS WHO SING

23:03.063 --> 23:05.666
FOR A NEW BROADWAY MUSICAL BASED
ON THE MOVIE 'DARK VICTORY.'"

23:05.666 --> 23:06.907
‐ DARK WHAT?
‐ ON IT.

23:06.907 --> 23:07.828
SHE'S GOING TO MOVE
BACK TO NEW YORK.

23:07.828 --> 23:09.069
SHE DOESN'T
HAVE THE JOB YET.

23:09.069 --> 23:11.231
"'DARK VICTORY.'
THE 1939 AMERICAN FILM

23:11.231 --> 23:12.673
DIRECTED BY EDMUND GOULDING,

23:12.673 --> 23:14.034
STARRING BETTE DAVIS,
GEORGE BRENT,

23:14.034 --> 23:15.235
GERALDINE FITZGERALD,
AND RONALD REAGAN."

23:15.235 --> 23:16.837
SOUNDS LIKE
A BARN BURNER.

23:16.837 --> 23:18.078
"BETTE DAVIS IS
A HEDONISTIC

23:18.078 --> 23:19.680
LONG ISLAND HEIRESS
WITH A PASSION FOR

23:19.680 --> 23:21.602
HORSES, FAST CARS, AND TOO MUCH
SMOKING AND DRINKING."

23:21.602 --> 23:23.403
THAT SOUNDS PERFECT
FOR MICHELLE.

23:23.403 --> 23:25.165
"ONE DAY, SHE FALLS OFF
HER HORSE AND ENDS UP
WITH A BRAIN TUMOR."

23:25.165 --> 23:26.847
THAT'S YOUR 11:00
NUMBER RIGHT THERE.

23:26.847 --> 23:28.208
"SHE FALLS IN LOVE
WITH HER DOCTOR,

23:28.208 --> 23:29.329
HE DOESN'T TELL HER
SHE'S DYING,

23:29.329 --> 23:31.251
SHE GOES BLIND,
AND SCENE."

23:31.251 --> 23:33.173
I CAN'T BELIEVE SHE'S
AUDITIONING AGAIN.

23:33.173 --> 23:34.254
SO WE SHOULD GO
WISH HER LUCK, RIGHT?

23:34.254 --> 23:35.536
‐ SURE. WHAT?
‐ WAIT.

23:35.536 --> 23:36.697
MAYBE THAT WOULD BE BAD.

23:36.697 --> 23:37.938
LIKE BAD LUCK.
WE'D JINX HER.

23:37.938 --> 23:39.459
I DON'T BELIEVE
IN JINXES.

23:39.459 --> 23:40.741
MAYBE MELANIE'S RIGHT.
I DON'T WANT TO BE

23:40.741 --> 23:42.222
THE REASON SHE
DOESN'T GET THE JOB.

23:42.222 --> 23:43.824
SO ARE WE WISHING
HER LUCK OR NOT?

23:43.824 --> 23:45.906
I DON'T KNOW.
I SO RARELY AGREE WITH BOO.

23:45.906 --> 23:46.867
I'M A LITTLE
THROWN HERE.

23:46.867 --> 23:48.148
WISH HER LUCK,
DON'T WISH HER LUCK,

23:48.148 --> 23:49.349
I DON'T CARE.

23:49.349 --> 23:50.911
I WANT TO GET A BETTER

SO... FREE.

34:32.472 --> 34:34.114
COMPLETELY FREE?

34:34.114 --> 34:35.716
NO RENT.

34:35.716 --> 34:36.997
MY GOD, MILLY‐‐

34:36.997 --> 34:38.438
YOU DO KNOW WHAT
FREE MEANS, RIGHT?

34:38.438 --> 34:40.280
‐ YES.
‐ THAT MEANS I DON'T
GIVE YOU MONEY.

34:40.280 --> 34:41.441
I KNOW WHAT FREE MEANS,
TRULY.

34:41.441 --> 34:44.204
GIVE ME A BREAK.

34:44.204 --> 34:47.207
I'M SORRY ABOUT SPARKLES.

34:47.207 --> 34:48.889
ABOUT RUINING IT FOR YOU.

34:52.172 --> 34:53.894
LOOKS LIKE
A NICE SPACE.

34:53.894 --> 34:56.176
IT HAS ASBESTOS
IN THE BATHROOM.

34:56.176 --> 34:57.578
I'LL HAVE IT REMOVED.

34:57.578 --> 34:59.339
UNLESS YOU DON'T THINK
YOU'LL NEED A BATHROOM.

34:59.339 --> 35:00.981
‐ THEN I GUESS‐‐
‐ I'M GONNA NEED
A BATHROOM.

35:00.981 --> 35:02.983
RIGHT.
OF COURSE YOU WILL.

35:05.586 --> 35:07.347
WELL...

35:07.347 --> 35:09.189
WE SHOULD TOAST,
RIGHT?

35:09.189 --> 35:10.350
CELEBRATE A NEW CHAPTER

35:10.350 --> 35:12.593
IN THE STONE
SISTERS' SAGA?

35:12.593 --> 35:14.595
YES.
YES WE SHOULD.

35:19.199 --> 35:21.361
I WOULD LIKE TWO SHOTS
OF SOMETHING BLUE

35:21.361 --> 35:23.604
THAT WON'T MAKE ME
THROW UP IMMEDIATELY.

35:23.604 --> 35:25.205
EXCUSE ME.

35:25.205 --> 35:27.127
I'M LOOKING FOR
MILLICENT STONE.

35:27.127 --> 35:28.288
I'M MILLY STONE.

35:28.288 --> 35:30.811
I HAVE A PACKAGE FOR YOU
FROM FANNY FLOWERS.

35:32.012 --> 35:33.774
WELL, THANK YOU.

35:33.774 --> 35:35.415
Scotty: <i>SHE'S GOT ME</i>
<i>DELIVERING PACKAGES NOW.</i>

35:35.415 --> 35:36.977
<i>I'M A MESSENGER BOY.</i>

35:36.977 --> 35:38.418
<i>THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW</i>
<i>I'LL BE WEARING A UNIFORM.</i>

35:38.418 --> 35:40.260
LITTLE HAT LIKE AN
ORGAN GRINDER'S MONKEY.

35:40.260 --> 35:41.982
YOU'D LOOK
GOOD IN A HAT.

35:41.982 --> 35:43.423
THAT'S WHAT
MY LIFE'S BECOME.

35:43.423 --> 35:45.065
MICHELLE SHOULD
HAVE WARNED ME,

35:45.065 --> 35:46.426
BUT SHE'S SADISTIC,
MY SISTER.

35:46.426 --> 35:47.788
YOU'RE MICHELLE'S
BROTHER?

35:47.788 --> 35:49.389
MICHELLE NEVER SAID
SHE HAD A BROTHER.

35:49.389 --> 35:51.191
YEAH, SHE'S GOT A BROTHER,
AND HE'S IN HELL.

35:51.191 --> 35:52.833
OKAY.
HERE'S YOUR PACKAGE,

35:52.833 --> 35:55.195
AND SHE WANTS
A SIGNATURE.

35:55.195 --> 35:57.197
THAT'S MY
PHONE NUMBER.

35:57.197 --> 35:59.159
JUST IN CASE.

36:00.280 --> 36:01.201
THANK YOU.

36:06.286 --> 36:09.009
‐ GOD, HE'S CUTE.
‐ SO CUTE.

36:09.009 --> 36:10.811
‐ HE KIND OF LOOKS LIKE HER.
‐ BUT CUTE.

36:10.811 --> 36:13.293
IT'S BEEN SO LONG SINCE
I THOUGHT ANYONE WAS CUTE.

36:13.293 --> 36:15.015
I KNOW,
I COULD JUST...

36:20.581 --> 36:21.662
OH, CRAP.

36:23.343 --> 36:25.185
Michelle:
<i>FANNY, I'M BACK.</i>

36:25.185 --> 36:27.267
‐ Fanny: <i>SO I SEE.</i>
‐ I WAS WONDERING IF
YOU WANTED ME TO SUB

36:27.267 --> 36:28.589
FOR YOU TONIGHT?
YOU KNOW, IN EXCHANGE‐‐

36:28.589 --> 36:29.830
HOLY HELL.
WHAT IS THAT?

36:29.830 --> 36:31.311
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO TALK TO YOU.

36:31.311 --> 36:33.273
THAT IS THE MOST
REPULSIVE THING
I HAVE EVER SEEN.

36:33.273 --> 36:35.836
HAS THE FALL RECITAL
TAKEN A VERY DISTURBING
THEMATIC TURN?

36:35.836 --> 36:37.437
GO HOME, MICHELLE.
WE'LL TALK TOMORROW.

36:40.601 --> 36:42.002
WHAT THE‐‐?

36:42.002 --> 36:43.243
MICHELLE,
PLEASE LEAVE.

36:43.243 --> 36:45.205
WHERE ON EARTH DID YOU
GET ALL THIS STUFF?

36:45.205 --> 36:47.087
MY FRIEND COLLEEN
USED TO BE A MIDWIFE.

36:47.087 --> 36:48.208
‐ FOR THE BORGIAS?
‐ <i>WHAT?</i>

36:48.208 --> 36:49.770
THIS STUFF IS ANCIENT.

36:49.770 --> 36:50.851
<i>NOT ALL OF IT.</i>

36:50.851 --> 36:52.372
THIS TELLS YOU HOW
TO MAKE A CONDOM

36:52.372 --> 36:54.454
OUT OF A YAK'S STOMACH,
AND BUILD AN ARK.

36:54.454 --> 36:56.016
I CAN'T EVEN‐‐
WHERE'S HIS HEAD?

36:56.016 --> 36:58.098
‐ IN THE PELVIS.
‐ OH, SWEET JESUS
AND MARY CHAIN.

36:58.098 --> 37:00.340
‐ <i>JUST GO AWAY.</i>
‐ I MAY NEVER CLOSE
MY EYES AGAIN.

37:00.340 --> 37:01.982
I MEAN IT,
MICHELLE.

37:01.982 --> 37:03.343
WHAT ARE THEY DOING
SITTING THERE?

37:03.343 --> 37:04.505
WHAT'S GOING ON?

37:04.505 --> 37:06.266
I HAVE DECIDED TO
DEVOTE TONIGHT'S CLASS

37:06.266 --> 37:08.348
TO THE SUBJECT OF
SEXUAL EDUCATION.

37:08.348 --> 37:09.830
NO.

37:09.830 --> 37:12.152
SOMEONE CAME TO YOU WITH
QUESTIONS ABOUT SEX.

37:12.152 --> 37:14.154
I KNOW THIS
BECAUSE YOU MAY BE

37:14.154 --> 37:15.996
ONE OF THE WORST
LIARS IN HISTORY.

37:15.996 --> 37:17.598
NOW SINCE I DON'T KNOW
WHICH ONE IT WAS,

37:17.598 --> 37:18.999
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO
TALK TO THEM ALL.

37:18.999 --> 37:20.440
‐ FANNY, NO. DON'T.
‐ WHY NOT?

37:20.440 --> 37:21.842
THEY DON'T WANT TO
HEAR THIS FROM YOU.

37:21.842 --> 37:23.163
WHY, BECAUSE I'M
A HIDEOUS OLD WOMAN?

37:23.163 --> 37:24.605
YOU'RE NOT HIDEOUS.

37:24.605 --> 37:27.007
YOU THINK I DON'T
KNOW ABOUT SEX?

37:27.007 --> 37:29.009
I KNOW ALL ABOUT SEX.

37:29.009 --> 37:31.612
I HAVE PASSAGES
IN MY DIARIES

37:31.612 --> 37:34.014
THAT WOULD MAKE
ANAIS NIN BLUSH.

37:34.014 --> 37:37.177
I AM NO STRANGER TO
CLANDESTINE CARNAL
KNOWINGS.

37:37.177 --> 37:39.620
AND I CAN EXPLAIN
IT ALL TO THEM.

37:39.620 --> 37:42.142
NOT IF YOU USE THE WORDS
"CLANDESTINE CARNAL KNOWINGS."

37:42.142 --> 37:44.585
GO AWAY, MICHELLE.

37:44.585 --> 37:46.587
<i>( cellphone rings )</i>

37:53.594 --> 37:55.355
FANNY, PLEASE.
I'M GONNA HANDLE THIS.

37:55.355 --> 37:56.517
‐ YOU ARE?
‐ YES.

37:56.517 --> 37:57.838
‐ WHEN?
‐ ON SUNDAY.

37:57.838 --> 37:58.999
‐ WHAT?
‐ WHEN THIS PERSON
CAME TO ME,

37:58.999 --> 38:00.601
WE MADE AN APPOINTMENT
TO TALK ON SUNDAY.

38:00.601 --> 38:02.603
‐ YOU'RE KIDDING.
‐ SUNDAY AT 6:00.

38:02.603 --> 38:04.164
OR 5:00...
4:00.

38:04.164 --> 38:07.007
SUNDAY SOMETIME BETWEEN
3:00 AND 8:00.

38:07.007 --> 38:09.169
YOU MADE AN APPOINTMENT
TO DISCUSS SEX

38:09.169 --> 38:12.012
WITH A YOUNG GIRL
ON SUNDAY BETWEEN
3:00 AND 8:00

38:12.012 --> 38:13.373
LIKE YOU'RE
THE CABLE GUY?

38:13.373 --> 38:14.815
WELL, YOU MAKE
THAT SOUND BAD.

38:14.815 --> 38:17.177
YOU WOULD PUT SOMETHING
THIS IMPORTANT OFF UNTIL
SUNDAY?

38:17.177 --> 38:18.378
SHE COULD BE
PREGNANT BY SUNDAY.

38:18.378 --> 38:19.660
SHE'S NOT GONNA BE
PREGNANT BY SUNDAY.

38:19.660 --> 38:21.501
‐ WHY NOT?
‐ BECAUSE SHE'S SMART, FANNY.

38:21.501 --> 38:23.143
SHE CAME TO YOU
FOR SEX ADVICE.

38:23.143 --> 38:25.225
OKAY, WE'RE NOT
TALKING MENSA SMART,

38:25.225 --> 38:27.628
BUT SHE'S SMART ENOUGH
NOT TO GET PREGNANT IN
TWO DAYS.

38:27.628 --> 38:31.151
I FEEL A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY
TO ALL THESE KIDS, MICHELLE.

38:31.151 --> 38:33.353
SO PLEASE JUST
LET ME HANDLE THIS.

38:33.353 --> 38:35.355
ALL RIGHT, SHANIA,
PASS THESE OUT.

38:36.597 --> 38:37.678
ALL RIGHT.

38:37.678 --> 38:39.439
EVERYONE'S GOING
TO GET ONE OF THESE.

38:39.439 --> 38:41.842
<i>NOW THE FIRST THING TO KNOW</i>

38:41.842 --> 38:43.604
IS THAT SEX
IS NOT IMPERSONAL.

38:43.604 --> 38:45.365
IT IS HUMAN
TO HUMAN.

38:45.365 --> 38:47.007
IT IS INTIMATE.

38:47.007 --> 38:48.368
<i>WE ARE GOING</i>
<i>TO TALK ABOUT</i>

38:48.368 --> 38:51.892
<i>HOW TO TRULY INTERACT</i>
<i>WITH THE OPPOSITE SEX.</i>

38:51.892 --> 38:54.094
EVERYONE,
NAME YOUR BANANAS.

38:54.094 --> 38:55.776
Michelle:
<i>OH MY GOD. FANNY.</i>

38:55.776 --> 38:57.177
GO AWAY.

38:57.177 --> 38:58.939
NAME IT ANYTHING
YOU LIKE.

38:58.939 --> 39:01.942
BUT A NAME THAT YOU HAVE
POSITIVE FEELINGS TOWARDS.

39:01.942 --> 39:03.183
THIS IS INSANE.

39:03.183 --> 39:05.626
GO AWAY IF YOU
DON'T WANT TO WATCH.

39:06.987 --> 39:08.428
NOW EVERYONE,

39:08.428 --> 39:12.833
PRETEND YOUR BANANA
HAS JUST ASKED YOU
TO HAVE SEX.

39:12.833 --> 39:14.915
( groans )

39:14.915 --> 39:16.036
<i>THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK.</i>

39:16.036 --> 39:17.638
I'M ALLERGIC
TO BANANAS.

39:23.163 --> 39:24.244
MADE A BREAK FOR IT?

39:24.244 --> 39:25.445
CLEAN GETAWAY.

39:25.445 --> 39:26.767
DON'T WORRY.
AFTER HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

39:26.767 --> 39:28.088
OF DOLLARS OF THERAPY,

39:28.088 --> 39:29.249
YOU'LL FORGET WHAT
JUST HAPPENED IN THERE.

39:29.249 --> 39:30.450
OH, SO THERE'S HOPE.

39:30.450 --> 39:32.372
HEAVY DRINKING MAY
SPEED THINGS ALONG.

39:38.018 --> 39:40.180
SO, HOW WAS
THE AUDITION TODAY?

39:43.023 --> 39:44.184
IT WAS FINE.

39:44.184 --> 39:46.146
YEAH?

39:46.146 --> 39:47.988
YEAH.

39:47.988 --> 39:49.590
GOOD.

39:49.590 --> 39:52.152
( sighs )

39:52.152 --> 39:54.154
YOU OKAY?

39:56.156 --> 39:58.158
HEY, WHAT'S WRONG?

39:58.158 --> 40:00.160
GINNY?

40:00.160 --> 40:02.002
MY BANANA'S NAME
IS FRANKIE.

40:02.002 --> 40:03.604
WHAT?

40:05.165 --> 40:06.607
I SLEPT WITH FRANKIE.

40:11.171 --> 40:13.173
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU WERE DATING FRANKIE.

40:13.173 --> 40:14.615
I'M NOT.

40:14.615 --> 40:16.176
HE DOESN'T DATE.
HE JUST...

40:16.176 --> 40:18.619
EXISTS WITH
THE REST OF HUMANITY.

40:18.619 --> 40:20.180
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

40:20.180 --> 40:21.622
I DON'T KNOW.

40:21.622 --> 40:24.024
I NEVER KNOW WHAT
HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

40:24.024 --> 40:27.027
AND HE CAN GO FOR
HOURS WITHOUT SAYING
ANYTHING AT ALL.

40:28.989 --> 40:30.150
HE'S JUST
SO BEAUTIFUL.

40:32.152 --> 40:33.233
I KNOW.

40:35.155 --> 40:36.597
CAN YOU LOVE SOMEONE
YOU'VE NEVER HAD

40:36.597 --> 40:37.678
A CONVERSATION WITH?

40:42.603 --> 40:44.004
WHEN DID YOU?

40:44.004 --> 40:46.006
LAST WEEK.

40:46.006 --> 40:48.008
AND SINCE?

40:50.010 --> 40:51.612
HAVEN'T SEEN HIM.

40:51.612 --> 40:55.015
HE HASN'T CALLED.
I DON'T THINK HE
HAS MY NUMBER.

40:55.015 --> 40:56.336
I'M NOT SURE
HE KNOWS MY NAME.

40:56.336 --> 40:58.178
I'M SURE HE
KNOWS YOUR NAME.

40:58.178 --> 41:00.020
I WROTE HIM A NOTE.

41:00.020 --> 41:01.181
‐ A NOTE?
‐ A THANK YOU NOTE.

41:01.181 --> 41:02.623
YOU WROTE HIM
A THANK YOU NOTE?

41:02.623 --> 41:04.184
I WROTE IT,
I PROOFED IT,
I SENT IT.

41:04.184 --> 41:06.266
I HAVE A COPY.

41:06.266 --> 41:07.708
WHAT DOES IT SAY?

41:10.150 --> 41:12.312
"DEAR FRANKIE,
I JUST WANTED
TO TELL YOU

41:12.312 --> 41:14.154
THAT I ENJOYED
OUR ENCOUNTER
VERY MUCH.

41:14.154 --> 41:15.395
AS FAR AS
FIRST TIMES GO,

41:15.395 --> 41:17.077
THIS SEEMED
SUCCESSFUL.

41:17.077 --> 41:18.158
GOOD LUCK.
GINNY."

41:18.158 --> 41:20.000
GOOD LUCK?
GOOD LUCK WITH WHAT?

41:22.002 --> 41:23.163
I DON'T KNOW.

41:23.163 --> 41:26.006
WHY DID I WRITE THIS?
WHY DID I SEND IT?

41:26.006 --> 41:27.608
WHY DID I‐‐

41:27.608 --> 41:30.010
( sighs )
I'M AN IDIOT.

41:30.010 --> 41:32.012
NO.

41:32.012 --> 41:34.014
HE'S NEVER GONNA
TALK TO ME AGAIN.

41:34.014 --> 41:35.616
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

41:38.178 --> 41:40.020
HE WAS JUST
SO BEAUTIFUL.
