to talk about your birthday?

00:48.941 --> 00:50.716
- Yes, yes, it's coming!

00:50.867 --> 00:52.109
- Okay, little one.

00:52.127 --> 00:54.035
This Saturday is all about you.

00:54.113 --> 00:54.720
What would you like to do?

00:54.871 --> 00:56.280
- What I always do.

00:56.298 --> 00:59.207
Get five Princess Jasmines
and watch them brush ponies

00:59.285 --> 01:01.134
in the backyard
with good friends and family.

01:01.211 --> 01:03.136
- I don't see any reason
our house couldn't host

01:03.138 --> 01:05.213
a children's party,
I'll fire up the grill.

01:05.291 --> 01:06.231
- Yay!

01:06.458 --> 01:08.809
- Hi, Sally,
it's Jing's birthday again.

01:08.961 --> 01:10.552
No, they don't
grow up that fast.

01:10.646 --> 01:12.979
Anyway, you know the drill,
five princesses,

01:13.132 --> 01:15.966
five ponies,
but don't send Sugar Cube.

01:15.968 --> 01:18.302
He's a biter,
and he's not welcome here.

01:18.395 --> 01:21.747
- Oh, I can't do another one
of those baby pony parties.

01:21.898 --> 01:24.732
Sugar Cube took a chunk
out of my ass.

01:24.752 --> 01:27.327
- Oh, but that princess party
makes Jing so happy.

01:27.479 --> 01:30.647
And us so miserable.
Let's kill it.

01:31.592 --> 01:35.260
- So my party will be a mix
of you guys and school friends.

01:35.337 --> 01:37.821
Don't worry,
they're cool, they're cool.

01:37.823 --> 01:39.172
Oh, hey there, Jing.

01:39.325 --> 01:40.933
Heard you're turning
the big 0-5.

01:41.084 --> 01:43.268
- That's right,
and you're both invited

01:43.345 --> 01:45.587
to my princess-pony party.
Yay!

01:45.664 --> 01:47.998
- Princess pony?
We got here just in time.

01:48.000 --> 01:51.092
Jing, your fifth birthday
basically defines what people

01:51.170 --> 01:52.836
think of you
for the rest of your life.

01:52.838 --> 01:54.338
The stakes could not be higher.

01:54.340 --> 01:56.598
- My fifth birthday
was so embarrassing,

01:56.675 --> 01:58.692
my reputation
never fully recovered.

01:58.768 --> 02:00.510
- What's a reputation?

02:00.529 --> 02:03.271
- It's what people think of you
when your fifth birthday

02:03.349 --> 02:05.849
is at a stupid
butterfly sanctuary

02:05.868 --> 02:07.851
and they're all still
in their cocoons

02:07.853 --> 02:09.294
and everyone calls you a liar.

02:09.446 --> 02:11.872
- Well, I'm doing
a princess pony party,

02:11.948 --> 02:13.448
and it's going to be fire.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.618

I just thought of a great place

02:16.637 --> 02:17.878
Jing could have her party

02:18.030 --> 02:20.197
and be the coolest kid
in kindergarten.

02:20.215 --> 02:21.473
- Oh, show us
this magical place

What is a laser recharge fee?

06:33.042 --> 06:35.543
- It's an additional $2
per player fee

06:35.562 --> 06:36.711
to recharge the lasers.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.304
- Recharge the lasers?

You mean plug them in?
That costs more?

- Oh, it's because
that's how they do it, babe.

06:54.973 --> 06:56.990
- So the fee includes
the lasers,

06:57.066 --> 06:58.399
but not the electricity?

06:58.419 --> 07:00.994
That's ludicrous--

extra to use the water.

09:12.368 --> 09:14.961
You are a strong woman
who fights for her beliefs

09:15.038 --> 09:16.871
even if those beliefs
cause resentment

09:16.948 --> 09:18.706
that will last a lifetime.

09:18.725 --> 09:20.392
But the kids are watching
through the window,

09:20.543 --> 09:22.227
so I'm going to look angry
and slam the door.

09:22.304 --> 09:23.728
[angrily]
Love you!

09:23.880 --> 09:25.471
Mom sucks.

09:25.624 --> 09:29.526
- [sighs] Why can't I be
a lovable coward like Jack?

09:31.146 --> 09:34.722
Oh, God, Bradley's mom.
Now I'm gonna hear it from her.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.149
- Hi, Patricia.

09:36.301 --> 09:39.319
I know, I made a scene
over the laser recharge fee.

09:39.395 --> 09:41.471
- And thank you.
- [gasps]

09:41.473 --> 09:43.990
- I saw your post, and it's
about time someone stood up

09:44.067 --> 09:45.399
to the thieves
at that hell palace.

09:45.477 --> 09:48.328
- Really?
- Yeah, it's the principle.

09:48.404 --> 09:50.814
It's like going to the pool
and paying extra for the water.

09:50.832 --> 09:53.908
- That's what I told her!
- You actually said that?

09:53.985 --> 09:56.152
- Of course,
how else could one put it?

09:56.154 --> 09:57.912
- You know, there's a group
of us on Screech

09:57.931 --> 09:59.580
that casually meet
and angrily vent

09:59.658 --> 10:01.600
about local businesses
every Wednesday.

10:01.676 --> 10:02.842
You should join us.

10:02.994 --> 10:04.327
- I'd love to.

10:04.329 --> 10:07.664
I'll even supply refreshments--
no hidden fees.

You need to say up front
if you're

10:11.853 --> 10:12.927
charging us for anything.

10:13.021 --> 10:14.696
- Of course. Of course, yes.

10:16.766 --> 10:18.617
- Ahh, Mondays.

10:18.768 --> 10:21.268
The day we forget everything
that happened over the weekend.

10:21.346 --> 10:22.954
- We'll never forget.

10:23.031 --> 10:25.606
It's in our
long term memory now.

10:25.659 --> 10:26.850
- Jing, look!

10:26.868 --> 10:28.868
I'm giving you
the evil eye over here.

10:28.945 --> 10:31.020

- All right, kids.

10:31.022 --> 10:32.631
That's enough
about Jing's party.

10:32.782 --> 10:34.299
Oh, Jing, I moved your seat.

10:34.376 --> 10:37.260

head lice kid and leash boy.

Puke, I am your father.

- Come on, kids.
Seriously, keep going.

11:01.720 --> 11:03.828
- And the bright side is,
I got hazard pay

11:03.980 --> 11:05.571
for disinfecting
the skydiving machine.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.290
What did you eat?

11:08.727 --> 11:10.059
- Okay, ha-ha.

11:10.078 --> 11:12.078
That thirty straight minutes
of humiliation could

11:12.155 --> 11:13.988
have happened to anyone.
I've moved on.

11:14.065 --> 11:15.915
- Mr. Mitch, yesterday,
you were discussing

11:16.067 --> 11:18.492
something called math?

11:18.512 --> 11:19.752
- Okay, good idea.

11:20.071 --> 11:22.255
Kids, today we're going
to learn to calculate velocity

11:22.331 --> 11:25.141
by using this
simple tabletop fan.

11:29.172 --> 11:32.190
- Ahh--the wind,
it's happening again.

11:32.341 --> 11:35.935
Save yourselves!
The vortex of death is upon us!

11:36.012 --> 11:39.605

He's still traumatized!

11:39.682 --> 11:41.015
- Mia, carry Duncan out

11:41.034 --> 11:43.593
so we can continue laughing
guilt free.

11:43.611 --> 11:45.036
[class laughing]

11:45.113 --> 11:47.188
- They're not laughing at me,
are they?

11:47.207 --> 11:50.934
- Of course not.
High school is a safe space.

11:50.936 --> 11:52.877
- Mia, can you keep a secret?

11:52.954 --> 11:54.954
I'm not over
the skydiving thing.

11:55.031 --> 11:56.047
- Duncan, are you familiar

11:56.199 --> 11:58.365
with cognitive behavioral
therapy?

11:58.385 --> 11:59.909
- Uh, refresh me.

11:59.911 --> 12:02.962
- The only way to get over
your fear is to face your fear.

12:03.039 --> 12:05.390
It's how I'm able
to be in the same room

12:05.467 --> 12:07.617
as my grandma's
porcelain dolls.

12:07.635 --> 12:09.561
We have to go back
to Teen Zone and--

12:09.712 --> 12:11.120

- Okay, okay.

12:11.139 --> 12:12.805
We'll get that cleaned up,

12:12.899 --> 12:15.049
but you need to go back
in that skydiving machine

12:15.068 --> 12:17.885
and heal your trauma
by confronting your phobia.

12:17.904 --> 12:21.222
- Can't we do it in baby steps,
like you point a hairdryer

12:21.241 --> 12:24.442
in my face, and the next day,
you turn it on?

12:24.594 --> 12:25.559
- Duncan, no.

12:25.637 --> 12:27.303
I watched a whole TikTok
about this.

12:27.305 --> 12:30.323
You're gonna meet me there
today at 4:00 before dinner,

12:30.475 --> 12:33.901
and you're gonna
make that machine ya bitch.

12:33.920 --> 12:37.297

for that soulful complaint.

13:03.024 --> 13:04.674
Okay, fellow Screechers

13:04.767 --> 13:06.342
We have a real treat today.

onto the complaining scene

of Teen Zone.

such a lovely group

My only complaint is that
it didn't happen sooner.

13:25.639 --> 13:27.030

13:27.032 --> 13:28.197

We're all here,

nephew's first Communion.

13:36.966 --> 13:39.133
The eggplant parm was for crap.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.894

of Jolly Ranchers.

13:44.549 --> 13:45.824

had no air.

13:48.829 --> 13:51.812
I had a hot flash,
and it did nothing.

13:51.890 --> 13:55.333
- Teen Zone's Screech page is
littered with our complaints,

13:55.410 --> 13:57.226
and they haven't
done a damn thing.

13:57.320 --> 13:59.912
It's time
to take the fight to them.

You mean, like, offline?

14:03.418 --> 14:05.993
But we're
anonymous curmudgeons.

14:06.071 --> 14:07.178

14:07.347 --> 14:10.239
You just haven't had
a charismatic leader like me.

14:10.258 --> 14:12.666
No offence, Patricia, I'm
just trying to whip them up.

14:12.686 --> 14:14.077
- Well, it's working.

14:14.095 --> 14:15.854
I say we write
a strongly worded letter

14:16.005 --> 14:17.671

under the friggin' door.

14:17.691 --> 14:20.174

14:20.193 --> 14:21.918
We wouldn't use our real names,
of course.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.227
Somebody could get mad.

14:23.304 --> 14:26.013
- Come on, people.
We need a big idea!

14:26.091 --> 14:28.257
What's the wildest thing
you can think of?

14:28.259 --> 14:30.943

you're my Uber driver.

18:15.744 --> 18:16.743
- Jack!
- Ah!

18:16.763 --> 18:18.078
- What are you doing here?

18:18.098 --> 18:19.931
- It's not what it looks like.

18:20.007 --> 18:21.766
I'm just redoing Jing's party

18:21.917 --> 18:23.843
against your
deepest wishes, God!

18:23.919 --> 18:27.012
- Hey, "wind walker."
- Mia! it's not 4 p.m. yet.

18:27.165 --> 18:28.589
- I got here early
so I could set up

18:28.666 --> 18:30.942
the livestream so every kid
in town can watch.

18:31.018 --> 18:33.002
That's how much
I believe in you.

18:33.004 --> 18:35.947
- Rat the place, Mom.

18:36.098 --> 18:37.448
- How could you do this, Jack?

18:37.600 --> 18:39.375
I thought we were
on the same page.

18:39.377 --> 18:42.620
And you're here paying extra
for the water in the pool!

18:42.771 --> 18:44.363
- It's a clunky metaphor,
Annie.

18:44.515 --> 18:46.290
Look, you were right
to stand up to this place,

18:46.442 --> 18:48.851
but if we took on every company
that exploits our love

18:48.853 --> 18:50.294
for our children,
what are we left with?

18:50.371 --> 18:51.612
Entertaining them ourselves?

18:51.631 --> 18:53.189
You want me
to saw you in half, Annie,

18:53.191 --> 18:55.282
'cause that's
where this is heading!

18:55.301 --> 18:57.710
Principles are great,
but are they going to put

18:57.862 --> 18:59.971
a smile like that
on our kids' face?

19:00.122 --> 19:04.550
<i> - Blast, blast!</i>
<i> Die slow, Bradley! [laughs]</i>

19:04.627 --> 19:06.035
- Aww.

19:06.037 --> 19:08.053
Support my daughter,
release the rats.

19:08.130 --> 19:10.130
Support my daughter,
release the rats.

19:10.150 --> 19:13.300
Why is this so hard, Jack?
- I don't know.

19:13.319 --> 19:15.044
Honestly, it seems
pretty clear cut.

19:15.046 --> 19:17.989
<i> - Now, that was</i>
<i> a laser-pocalypse!</i>

19:18.140 --> 19:21.233
<i> Put your sticky little hands</i>
<i> together for Jing!</i>

19:21.327 --> 19:23.452
<i> all: Jing! Jing! Jing!</i>
<i> Jing! Jing! Jing!</i>

19:25.723 --> 19:28.073
- Attention, Jing party of ten.

19:28.226 --> 19:31.169
Re-recharge those lasers
and break out the crap pizza.

19:31.320 --> 19:34.321
You're staying here all night!
Ugh!

19:34.340 --> 19:36.399
- Actually, we close at 6:00.

19:36.401 --> 19:40.403
- You close at what time,
you money grubbing leeches?

19:40.405 --> 19:43.088
- I mean, I could stay
until, like, 7:30, I guess.

19:43.165 --> 19:45.090
- That's all night
to a five-year-old.

19:45.167 --> 19:49.520
I love you, Mommy.
- Happy birthday, sweetheart.

19:49.672 --> 19:50.913
- Sweet moment, Annie.

19:50.915 --> 19:54.007
But we came for blood.
Small business blood.

19:54.085 --> 19:56.343
- I know your pain,
I know your hurt,

19:56.362 --> 19:57.862
but you need to go home now.

19:57.939 --> 19:59.772
You're very special,
we love you,

19:59.848 --> 20:01.699
but go home
and go home in peace.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.517
- Like hell, Annie!

20:03.594 --> 20:05.761
You got us offline
and riled up!

20:05.763 --> 20:07.688
[rats chittering]

20:07.765 --> 20:08.948
[crowd gasps]

20:09.100 --> 20:10.766
- Come on, rats. Damn!

20:10.785 --> 20:13.269
- Okay, Kimberly, torso time.

20:13.271 --> 20:14.212
Ah!

20:17.032 --> 20:19.442
- Oh, no, no--
I'm not ready, you monster!

20:19.460 --> 20:20.885
- Of course you are.

20:20.962 --> 20:23.796
I'll be right there holding
your hand, and if you throw up,

20:23.948 --> 20:26.057
I'll be right there
holding your hair.

20:29.303 --> 20:32.063
- I'm doing it!
I'm the greatest skydiver ever!

20:32.139 --> 20:34.656
I had nothing to be afraid of.

20:34.658 --> 20:37.026
[rats chittering]

20:39.722 --> 20:42.406
both: Ah! Rat-nado!

20:42.558 --> 20:44.316
[screaming]

20:44.469 --> 20:49.229
- [laughs] He's gonna be
even more traumatized.

20:49.249 --> 20:52.992
Grandma, will you make me a rat
costume for school tomorrow?

20:53.068 --> 20:55.294
- Way ahead of you, dear.

20:58.666 --> 20:59.648
<i> - Tired of lame arcades with</i>

20:59.667 --> 21:01.241
<i> just games, rides and prizes?</i>

21:01.261 --> 21:04.262
- I wish there was a place
with something cool, like rats.

21:04.413 --> 21:06.764
<i> - Teen Zone, Teen Zone,</i>
<i> Teen Zone.</i>

21:06.915 --> 21:08.340
<i> Now with rats!</i>

21:08.493 --> 21:09.600
both: Rat-ical.

21:09.827 --> 21:12.177
- They've got rabies, baby.

21:12.330 --> 21:15.164
- We survived Rat-nado.
- Can you?

21:15.166 --> 21:18.109
<i> - Teen Zone:</i>
<i> where teens and rats go in!</i>

21:18.260 --> 21:20.778
<i> Rats are an additional charge.</i>

21:20.855 --> 21:22.947
[all groaning]

21:23.098 --> 21:24.931
- It was worth it
for the free tokens.

21:24.951 --> 21:27.676
- Totally. Let's go downtown
and bite people.

21:27.678 --> 21:28.844
all: Get some.

21:28.863 --> 21:30.705
[all growling]
