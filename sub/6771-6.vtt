( inaudible dialogue )

00:09.342 --> 00:12.044
( all shouting
and gasping )

00:21.588 --> 00:24.423
Whoo-hoo!

00:24.425 --> 00:26.425
Nice moves, kid.

00:26.427 --> 00:27.426
Nice moves?

00:27.428 --> 00:30.262
Rainbow dash thinks
I've got...

00:31.765 --> 00:34.233
Ah! Nice moves!

01:12.472 --> 01:16.241
Then, all of a sudden,
I'm airborne.

01:16.243 --> 01:19.144
And then rainbow dash
looks over and is like,

01:19.146 --> 01:21.613
"nice moves, kid."

01:21.615 --> 01:22.414
Wow!

01:22.416 --> 01:23.348
She really said that?

01:23.350 --> 01:25.150
I mean, it's like
she practically told me

01:25.152 --> 01:26.452
She wanted to take me
under her wing,

01:26.454 --> 01:31.223
Teach me everything she knows,
and become, like, my big sister.

01:31.225 --> 01:33.258
I don't know
about all that.

01:33.260 --> 01:36.728
It was a really
nice compliment and all but--

01:36.730 --> 01:37.763
I know, I know.

01:37.765 --> 01:40.699
But all that stuff
I said could happen, right?

01:40.701 --> 01:42.234
Sure.
Absolutely.

01:42.236 --> 01:45.304
I just need to find a way
to spend some time with her.

01:45.306 --> 01:48.240
You know, so she can see
more of my awesomeness.

01:48.242 --> 01:51.677
Well, applejack and I are
supposed to be camping

01:51.679 --> 01:53.378
Up at winsome falls
this weekend.

01:53.380 --> 01:56.281
Maybe I could get my big sis
to invite rainbow dash,

01:56.283 --> 01:58.117
And then
you could come too.

01:58.119 --> 01:58.784
Really?!

01:58.786 --> 02:01.487
Sure.
I wanna go.

02:01.489 --> 02:02.588
Well, duh.

02:02.590 --> 02:03.655
Of course you can go.

02:03.657 --> 02:06.325
And I'll get rarity
to come too.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.427
Rarity loves camping!

02:08.429 --> 02:10.129
I despise camping!

02:10.131 --> 02:13.499
All of that--
ugh! --Nature.

02:13.501 --> 02:16.768
Applejack's going
with her little sister.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.470
But, you know,

02:18.472 --> 02:21.874
If you don't want
to spend time with me...

02:22.775 --> 02:24.743
Oh, all right.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.912
Oh! Of course I will need
to find an outfit

02:26.914 --> 02:30.149
More appropriate
for roughing it. Ooh.

02:30.151 --> 02:33.552
See? Told you
she'd want to go.

02:37.423 --> 02:39.791
You pack the bug spray?
Yep.

02:39.793 --> 02:42.528
You got the canteens?
Yep.

02:42.530 --> 02:45.564
Looks like
we're all set then.

02:49.769 --> 02:51.203
Hey!

02:51.205 --> 02:53.872
Gee, rarity,
did you remember to pack?

02:53.874 --> 02:55.641
Oh, well, see who gets
the last laugh

02:55.643 --> 02:57.409
When you're absolutely desperate
to curl your lashes

02:57.411 --> 03:00.512
And realize you didn't bring
your eyelash curler.

03:00.514 --> 03:03.582
Well, looks like
we're all set now.

03:03.584 --> 03:05.584
But what
about rainbow dash?

03:05.586 --> 03:06.818
Isn't rainbow dash coming?

03:06.820 --> 03:07.953
Course she is,
sugarcube.

03:07.955 --> 03:10.522
She's gonna meet us
up at our first campsite.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.191
Oh.
All right, y'all,

03:12.193 --> 03:14.293
Let's move 'em out.

03:14.295 --> 03:17.429
( <i>majestic theme playing</i> )

03:20.400 --> 03:21.800
Oh, are we there yet?

03:21.802 --> 03:25.771
The last thousand times you
asked that, the answer was no.

03:25.773 --> 03:27.673
This time,
it's actually yes.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.975
There's rainbow dash
up there right now.

03:29.977 --> 03:33.412
( <i>upbeat rock theme playing</i> )

03:41.487 --> 03:42.454
Wow!

03:42.456 --> 03:44.623
All right, scootaloo,

03:44.625 --> 03:47.793
Just play it cool.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.561
Hey, rain--

03:52.832 --> 03:54.299
( clears throat )

03:54.301 --> 03:56.735
Hey, rainbow dash,
what's up?

03:56.737 --> 03:59.304
What took
you guys so long?

03:59.306 --> 04:01.406
Well, some of us
didn't pack as light

04:01.408 --> 04:05.577
As the others,
so we were slowed down a bit.

04:06.479 --> 04:10.315
( <i>upbeat theme playing</i> )

04:14.554 --> 04:17.389
Looks like you'll be sharing
a tent with me, huh?

04:17.391 --> 04:18.857
If that's okay
with you.

04:18.859 --> 04:21.460
Sure, long as
you don't snore.

04:21.462 --> 04:23.595
You don't snore,
do you?

04:23.597 --> 04:24.930
Nope, no way,
not me.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.466
Never snored a day
or night in my life.

04:27.468 --> 04:31.703
Then you and I are gonna
get along just fine.

04:37.310 --> 04:39.544
You have to got
to be kidding me.

04:39.546 --> 04:40.979
Sweetie belle,
do be a dear and see

04:40.981 --> 04:45.017
If you can find some fresh
flowers for my bedside vase.

04:46.386 --> 04:48.453
Hey, scootaloo,
do be a sweetheart

04:48.455 --> 04:50.889
And see if you can
gather some firewood.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.958
( both laugh )

04:52.960 --> 04:53.759
Seriously though,

04:53.761 --> 04:56.328
Can you get us some wood
for the fire?

04:56.330 --> 04:58.063
Of course.

05:00.867 --> 05:04.469
Okay, everybody
get comfortable.

05:06.606 --> 05:08.073
Because I'm about
to tell you

05:08.075 --> 05:09.908
The best story
you ever heard.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.576
Is it about the time
when rarity had wings,

05:11.578 --> 05:13.845
And then they got ruined,
and then you saved her

05:13.847 --> 05:15.314
From plummeting
to her doom?

05:15.316 --> 05:19.651
Okay, maybe it's the second-best
story you ever heard,

05:19.653 --> 05:22.621
But probably
still the scariest.

05:22.623 --> 05:25.724
You like
scary stories, right?

05:25.726 --> 05:27.092
( gasps )

05:27.094 --> 05:28.427
Mm-hm.

05:28.429 --> 05:30.729
It all happened
on a night

05:30.731 --> 05:32.898
Just like this one,

05:32.900 --> 05:37.769
In a forest
just like this...

05:38.404 --> 05:41.473
And then
the olden pony asked,

05:41.475 --> 05:45.911
"who's got
my rusty horseshoe?"

05:45.913 --> 05:47.479
Not me.

05:48.047 --> 05:48.847
You do!

05:48.849 --> 05:49.915
Both: Aah!
( laughs )

05:49.917 --> 05:51.550
( coughs then
clears throat )

05:51.552 --> 05:53.085
Something
in my throat.

05:53.087 --> 05:55.087
I wasn't scared at all.

05:55.089 --> 05:56.621
Ha-ha. Good story!

05:56.623 --> 05:58.523
Knew you
wouldn't be scared.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.025
Way you jumped
that cart the other day.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.961
You're like me,
fearless.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.830
Yeah, fearless.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.365
( owl hooting )

06:06.367 --> 06:07.833
Don't worry,
rarity is here

06:07.835 --> 06:10.869
To keep you safe
and sound. Ooh.

06:10.871 --> 06:11.570
( yawns )

06:11.572 --> 06:14.639
Think it's about time
for me to hit the straw.

06:14.641 --> 06:15.941
( teeth chattering )

06:15.943 --> 06:17.609
Don't you worry,
little sis,

06:17.611 --> 06:19.678
There's no olden pony
in our tent.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.581
Heh-heh, that sure
was funny, wasn't it,

06:22.583 --> 06:26.385
How they were all afraid
of the olden pony?

06:26.387 --> 06:27.886
But not me. Heh.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.421
That's because
you're tough,

06:29.423 --> 06:32.424
Just like when
I was your age.

06:32.925 --> 06:33.892
( screams )

06:33.894 --> 06:34.893
I'm hitting the sack.

06:34.895 --> 06:37.529
Come in whenever
you feel like it.

06:38.698 --> 06:40.031
( branch cracks )

06:40.033 --> 06:41.433
( wind howling )

06:41.435 --> 06:42.801
It's nothing,

06:42.803 --> 06:44.636
Just my imagination.

06:44.638 --> 06:45.637
( trees creaking )

06:45.639 --> 06:50.809
And that isn't the thundering
stomp of the olden pony.

06:50.811 --> 06:54.579

06:57.884 --> 07:00.452

07:04.657 --> 07:07.692

Uh, is anyone
out there?

08:23.704 --> 08:25.570
What's that noise?

08:25.572 --> 08:27.539
Is there a bug in here?

08:27.541 --> 08:31.743
I don't know about you,
but I slept like a filly.

08:31.745 --> 08:33.111
Best night ever.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.112
Glad you're rested up,

08:34.114 --> 08:35.714
Because we've got
a long trek ahead.

08:35.716 --> 08:39.551
Totally gonna be worth it
when we get to winsome falls.

08:39.553 --> 08:42.254
Yeah, totally.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.291
( rarity groans )

08:46.293 --> 08:47.292
Am I sweating?

08:47.294 --> 08:50.228
Oh, I think
I'm sweating!

08:50.830 --> 08:53.565
Oh, uh, but it's
absolutely worth it

08:53.567 --> 08:56.101
To get to spend time
with my little sister.

08:56.103 --> 08:57.769
It's just that
this cart feels like

08:57.771 --> 08:59.170
It's getting heavier
all the time!

08:59.172 --> 09:02.908
Applejack:
I don't care if that cart's
as heavy as a pack of mules.

09:02.910 --> 09:04.042
If we don't
get a move on,

09:04.044 --> 09:06.811
It'll be dark before
we get to the campsite.

09:06.813 --> 09:07.879
Ah, dark?

09:07.881 --> 09:10.949
I'll just ride ahead
to make sure the path is clear.

09:10.951 --> 09:15.020
Now, we don't want to be
out here after dark, right?

09:15.022 --> 09:16.621
Doesn't matter to me.

09:16.623 --> 09:18.156
Well, you know,

through the bushes.

I heard something.

aah!

10:34.201 --> 10:36.067

a little jumpy.

my exercise.

it is to stretch out

every so often. Ha.

friends for?

10:58.157 --> 11:00.058
No need for tents
tonight, y'all.

11:00.060 --> 11:03.294
We'll just take shelter
in that cave.

11:04.030 --> 11:06.731
All right,
a deep dark cave.

11:06.733 --> 11:09.167
Ha, perfect for the story
I've got for tonight.

11:09.169 --> 11:13.672
All we need is a campfire
and we're good to go.

of firewood from the deep,

11:37.731 --> 11:41.933

because, you know,

12:18.371 --> 12:22.107

that many trees around here.

Why don't you sit

12:25.445 --> 12:27.512

for a while?

12:31.917 --> 12:33.818
Now, where was I?

12:33.820 --> 12:37.856

12:37.858 --> 12:39.524

12:41.026 --> 12:42.494

12:42.496 --> 12:45.530
How about
I tell tonight's story?

12:45.532 --> 12:46.331
All right,

12:46.333 --> 12:47.866
Just make sure
it's a horrible one.

12:47.868 --> 12:51.369
Scootaloo:
There once was
a really, really nice pony

12:51.371 --> 12:53.938
Who lived in
a bright and sunny land,

12:53.940 --> 12:55.874
Where there were
rainbows every day

12:55.876 --> 12:58.543
And lots and lots
of happy friends, and--

12:58.545 --> 13:01.279
No offense, but it's not
a real campfire story

13:01.281 --> 13:03.948
Unless
somepony's shaking.

13:03.950 --> 13:05.183
I've been told

13:05.185 --> 13:08.386
That these very woods
are haunted...

13:09.355 --> 13:12.157
...By the headless horse!

13:12.159 --> 13:14.993
It gallops only at night.

13:14.995 --> 13:17.328
If it doesn't have a head,
then how in tarnation

13:17.330 --> 13:19.130
Does this pony
know where it's goin'?

13:19.132 --> 13:22.200
It's headless,
not brainless.

13:22.202 --> 13:26.237

13:26.239 --> 13:28.840
So where's its brain?

13:28.842 --> 13:29.340
Ugh.

13:29.342 --> 13:32.243
Fear was dripping
from the air...

13:32.245 --> 13:37.515
...And they were never
heard from ever again!

13:37.517 --> 13:39.284
Ah! Never?

13:39.286 --> 13:41.119
Never.

You'll be safe
with me tonight.

13:51.497 --> 13:53.531
It's not time
for bed yet, is it?

13:53.533 --> 13:55.200
Afraid so, scootaloo.

13:55.202 --> 13:56.067

You are so, so much better

So it's a horse
without a head,

18:11.858 --> 18:14.258
Which means
it doesn't have a mouth,

18:14.260 --> 18:15.526
And if it doesn't
have a mouth,

18:15.528 --> 18:19.464
Then it's not

I just wanted you
to hang out with me

you'd take me under your wing,

19:31.538 --> 19:32.904

19:32.906 --> 19:34.772
And become, like,
my big sister.

19:34.774 --> 19:37.341
But then you started telling
those spooky stories,

19:37.343 --> 19:38.776
And I got scared.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.311
I thought I heard
the headless horse

19:40.313 --> 19:42.847
So I ran out here
by myself and--

Well, I guess
you know the rest.

Hey, I'm gonna

But if you ever tell anypony
else, I'm gonna deny it.

those stories,

You were?

20:01.834 --> 20:02.600
Sure.

20:02.602 --> 20:04.802
I mean, I got over it,
because I realized pretty quick

20:04.804 --> 20:07.505
That if there was such
a thing as a headless horse,

20:07.507 --> 20:10.241
I could
totally take it on.
