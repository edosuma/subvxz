- That's "former" chairman.

00:21.310 --> 00:22.689
As I recall, he resigned?
- True.

00:22.758 --> 00:24.241
- You know, I'd really like to
be focusing

00:24.310 --> 00:25.517

you quite understand

00:34.517 --> 00:35.896
the power dynamics at play here.

00:35.965 --> 00:38.448

- And his former intern.

00:52.172 --> 00:53.172
- I don't think
that's necessary.

00:53.241 --> 00:54.931
- Oh...

00:55.000 --> 00:56.689
Oh--oh, he's here.

00:58.793 --> 01:00.172
Charles.

01:00.241 --> 01:02.344
It is so good to see you.
Oh!

01:02.413 --> 01:04.068
I feel like everything
is right with the world again.

01:04.137 --> 01:05.689
- I'm happy to see you, Diana.

01:05.758 --> 01:07.965
I just didn't expect
so many boxes.

01:08.034 --> 01:11.206
- Oh, well, they're a testament
to a long and successful career.

01:11.275 --> 01:12.551
- And a lack of storage.

01:12.620 --> 01:14.034
- We just sold Pound Ridge

01:14.103 --> 01:16.896
and Pauline sent all my stuff
from there here.

01:16.965 --> 01:19.413
- Oh, you sold Pound Ridge?
That gorgeous estate?

01:19.482 --> 01:22.551
- Yeah, had to.
- Oh, my God, the memories.

01:22.620 --> 01:24.965
The company picnics.
The sack races.

01:25.034 --> 01:27.413
You poured your heart
and soul into that house.

01:27.482 --> 01:28.655
- Part of the divorce.

01:28.724 --> 01:30.620
- Oh, what a romantic
cautionary tale.

01:30.689 --> 01:33.206
I'm not sure marriage
should be in the cards again--

01:33.275 --> 01:34.551
for either of us.

01:34.620 --> 01:37.103
- It's just a house.
Good morning, Liza.

01:37.172 --> 01:38.413
- Morning.

01:40.931 --> 01:43.206
- Do you ever feel
like a giant wrecking ball?

01:43.275 --> 01:45.068
- He didn't sell the house
because of me.

01:45.137 --> 01:47.724
- It's okay, I blame myself.
I'm the one who hired you.

01:47.793 --> 01:51.344
At the time, I thought you were
more stalwart than seductive.

01:51.413 --> 01:53.965
- I'm... very stalwart.

01:54.034 --> 01:55.448
- Hm.

01:55.517 --> 01:57.896
Well, what can I say?
Love is blind.

02:05.517 --> 02:08.586
- What's in all the boxes?

02:08.655 --> 02:11.689
- 20 years of old galleys,

02:11.758 --> 02:13.482
manuscripts I've never read,

02:13.551 --> 02:15.241
some books I probably
should have published

02:15.310 --> 02:17.034
and didn't, and vice-versa.

02:17.103 --> 02:19.862
Mostly junk, but I gotta
go through it to be sure.

02:19.931 --> 02:21.586
- Well, it's so crowded in here,
you can hardly see

02:21.655 --> 02:23.103
the flowers someone sent you.

02:23.172 --> 02:24.655
-  Oh.

02:36.517 --> 02:39.620
It's nice to be home.

02:42.827 --> 02:45.827
- Even if it does look like
an episode of "Hoarders."

02:45.896 --> 02:47.310
- Where do you want
the rest of these, boss?

02:47.379 --> 02:48.586
I don't think you got
enough room in here.

02:48.655 --> 02:49.586
- Oh, you can take
the rest of these

02:49.655 --> 02:51.896
to my office, please.

02:51.965 --> 02:53.793
We can sort through it all
together.

02:57.068 --> 02:59.758
- Ah--

02:59.827 --> 03:01.724
- My God,
can I help you with that?

03:01.793 --> 03:03.724
- What happened to
the old machine?

03:03.793 --> 03:06.517
- I upped the coffee game
around here.

03:06.586 --> 03:08.000
- Smart move.

03:08.068 --> 03:10.862
But getting me and Charles
back to prop you up?

03:10.931 --> 03:11.827
Genius.

03:11.896 --> 03:13.827
- That's not what this is about.

03:13.896 --> 03:15.724
- Mm-hmm, tell yourself that.

03:15.793 --> 03:18.413
For the record, though,
I was not a fan of the merger.

03:18.482 --> 03:20.482
- I threw Charles a lifeline.

03:20.551 --> 03:21.827
Now I'm just
trying to figure out

03:21.896 --> 03:23.724
how much dead weight
comes attached to it.

03:23.793 --> 03:26.931
- Are you referring to me?
- Your books.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.862
What you have,
what you've bid to acquire.

03:29.931 --> 03:32.000
Basically
a performance evaluation.

03:32.068 --> 03:36.655
- I never heard you complain
about my, uh, performance.

03:36.724 --> 03:38.689
- I'm talking about at work,

03:38.758 --> 03:40.482
where you will be
reporting to me,

03:40.551 --> 03:41.862
which I hope won't be a problem,

03:41.931 --> 03:44.413
because I really
don't want it to be a problem.

03:44.482 --> 03:46.551
I don't have
the bandwidth for problems.

03:46.620 --> 03:50.448
- Oh, I'm not gonna be
your problem, Peters.

03:51.758 --> 03:53.413
- Good.

03:53.482 --> 03:56.137
Glad we had the talk.
See you in the meeting.

- What is Mercury?

04:08.827 --> 04:11.448
Books with male appeal,
but not dry.

04:11.517 --> 04:13.586
Books with heart.
Skews older.

04:13.655 --> 04:14.724
- Not that old.

04:14.793 --> 04:15.862
- Well, older than Millennial,

04:15.931 --> 04:18.241
which is more female under 40,

04:18.310 --> 04:19.724
which is our core demo.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.931
- Actually, Mercury,
as Zane and I conceived it,

04:22.000 --> 04:23.862
is designed to appeal
to men and women.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.965
And we're pretty agnostic
about age.

04:26.034 --> 04:28.482
- Of course.
Can we all agree that this

04:28.551 --> 04:30.000
would be a perfect
Mercury title?

04:30.068 --> 04:32.103
- Absolutely,
a smart thrill ride

04:32.172 --> 04:33.620
with a male protagonist.

04:33.689 --> 04:35.344
- After looking over
your current acquisitions,

04:35.413 --> 04:37.310
I feel that this book

04:37.379 --> 04:40.275
would be much better suited
as a Millennial title.

04:40.344 --> 04:41.724
- You lost that book.

04:41.793 --> 04:43.482
You can't just poach it now
because you wanted it.

04:43.551 --> 04:45.310
- It's just a better fit
for Millennial.

04:45.379 --> 04:48.517
A story of a young woman
who may or not be a killer?

04:48.586 --> 04:50.310
It's a real-life "Gone Girl."

04:50.379 --> 04:51.551
- Which is why we bought it.

04:51.620 --> 04:53.241
- We have to each
define our brands

04:53.310 --> 04:54.620
in order to work together, Zane.

04:54.689 --> 04:56.206
- Yes.
I told her that.

04:56.275 --> 04:58.206
- Charles, if we give up that
book, what are we left with?

04:58.275 --> 04:59.724
"The Third Leg"?

04:59.793 --> 05:02.241
- Which is a perfect title
for your debut.

05:02.310 --> 05:05.724
How to keep the flame alive
in a long-term relationship.

05:05.793 --> 05:10.241
It appeals to both
middle-aged men and women.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.172
- Charles...

05:14.034 --> 05:16.827
- Kelsey, I appreciate
the thoughtful analysis,

05:16.896 --> 05:21.103
but, uh, Audrey Colbert
needs to stay at Mercury.

05:25.931 --> 05:30.172
- Okay, Charles,
if that's what you want.

05:35.379 --> 05:37.793
How am I ever gonna
make this work with Charles?

05:37.862 --> 05:39.379
I'm still intimidated by him.

05:39.448 --> 05:42.034
- You've told him off before.
- It was different then.

05:42.103 --> 05:44.275
I--I was a scrappy,
little underdog

05:44.344 --> 05:45.379
standing up to power.

05:45.448 --> 05:46.379
- He respects you.

05:46.448 --> 05:47.689
- He was my mentor.

05:47.758 --> 05:49.413
I owe him my career.

05:49.482 --> 05:51.689
And now I'm supposed
to tell him no?

05:51.758 --> 05:54.034
It's starting to feel like
Quinn all over again.

05:54.103 --> 05:55.448
- Charles knows you're
the publisher

05:55.517 --> 05:57.068
of the combined brands.

05:57.137 --> 05:58.862
He's enjoying being an editor
on the creative side,

05:58.931 --> 06:01.034
without all the responsibility
of being a publisher.

06:01.103 --> 06:03.620
- Yeah, but then he gives me
that--that--

06:03.689 --> 06:05.448
death stare, and I crumble.

06:05.517 --> 06:07.379
- Oh, I know that stare.
He doesn't really mean it.

06:07.448 --> 06:09.896
It's like the male version
of resting bitch face.

06:09.965 --> 06:11.517
- Really?
- Oh, totally.

06:11.586 --> 06:13.448
You're just projecting
all of that authority onto it.

06:13.517 --> 06:15.000
Look at it another way.

06:15.068 --> 06:17.000
It can actually be
pretty smoldering.

06:17.068 --> 06:18.172
- Ew.

06:18.241 --> 06:20.000
No, I do not want
to look at it that way.

06:20.068 --> 06:21.620
- No, no, it's better
that you don't.

06:24.379 --> 06:26.137
- Wow.

06:30.310 --> 06:31.379
Oh!

06:31.448 --> 06:33.241
Oh, my God.

06:45.758 --> 06:49.206
Hi.

06:49.275 --> 06:50.689
Oh.

06:50.758 --> 06:52.655
Do you want me to pick you up
at your place tonight?

06:52.724 --> 06:53.931
- For?
- The, uh--

06:54.000 --> 06:55.758
- The Reading Project
fundraiser.

06:55.827 --> 06:58.689
That's tonight?
- Mm, in Tuxedo Park.

06:58.758 --> 07:00.448
It's pure hell,
but I have to go.

07:00.517 --> 07:02.896
You're off the hook if you want.
- No, I want to go.

07:02.965 --> 07:05.689
We can suffer together.
In evening wear.

07:05.758 --> 07:08.068
- Hm, actually
it's the eighth circle of Hell.

07:08.137 --> 07:10.275
The ninth is going through
these boxes.

07:10.344 --> 07:12.034
It just fell open.

07:12.103 --> 07:13.896
I'm not really
a glutton for punishment.

07:13.965 --> 07:16.482
- Let me know if you still
feel that way after tonight.

07:16.551 --> 07:19.137
Can I help you?
- I got it.

07:19.206 --> 07:21.275
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

07:31.068 --> 07:34.586
FYI, Kelsey is still
intimidated by you.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.620
- Really?
I was pretty careful

07:36.689 --> 07:37.965
not to wear a suit this morning.

07:38.034 --> 07:39.310
-  I noticed,
but that doesn't help

07:39.379 --> 07:40.862
with the height, your age,
and the fact that

07:40.931 --> 07:42.103
you used to run the place.

07:42.172 --> 07:44.620
- Mm, can't help
with any of those.

07:44.689 --> 07:46.655
- She thinks she can't
say no to you.

07:46.724 --> 07:48.000
- Well, that's a problem.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.482
I can't have a yes man
as my publisher.

07:49.551 --> 07:50.620
- Then you need to respect her

07:50.689 --> 07:51.827
when she says no to your books.

07:51.896 --> 07:53.517
- Absolutely, she needs to be

07:53.586 --> 07:55.241
strong enough to stand up to me.

07:55.310 --> 07:57.379
Thank you.
- That's a tall order.

07:57.448 --> 07:58.793
Pun intended.

07:59.965 --> 08:02.344
- Oh, my God, the lovebirds.

08:02.413 --> 08:03.862
- Wow, what a surprise.

08:03.931 --> 08:06.103
- Oh, didn't Charles tell you?
We're at your table.

08:06.172 --> 08:08.103
- No...
- Didn't I?

08:08.172 --> 08:09.827
- We never miss this event.

08:09.896 --> 08:12.068
- I just love seeing this.

08:12.137 --> 08:14.965
And to think, it all started
at our little Hanukkah party.

08:15.034 --> 08:17.275
- Well, that's what
we tell ourselves anyway.

08:17.344 --> 08:20.172
Liza, did you know that
Tuxedo Park is actually

08:20.241 --> 08:22.517
the home of the tuxedo?
- Mm-hmm.

08:22.586 --> 08:23.827
- Actually, I did not.

08:23.896 --> 08:25.413
- Wearing a tuxedo
in Tuxedo Park

08:25.482 --> 08:26.862
is basically like

08:26.931 --> 08:29.034
drinking a Singapore Sling
in Singapore.

08:29.103 --> 08:30.482
- Oh.
-  Or having

08:30.551 --> 08:31.758
breakfast at Tiffany's.

08:31.827 --> 08:32.758
- I hope the four of us
get to do

08:32.827 --> 08:34.172
all those things together.

08:34.241 --> 08:36.620
Maybe even on a cruise.

08:36.689 --> 08:38.689
- To our cruise to Singapore.

08:38.758 --> 08:40.586
And breakfast at Tiffany's.

08:40.655 --> 08:42.482
- Well, at least
we crossed Tuxedo Park

08:42.551 --> 08:43.827
off our bucket list.

08:43.896 --> 08:45.379
Hey.
- Cheers.

08:45.448 --> 08:47.448
- Liza?
Oh!

08:47.517 --> 08:50.344
- Michelle, hi.
- What are you doing here?

08:50.413 --> 08:53.034
- Um, well, I--
I'm here with Charles.

08:53.103 --> 08:56.482
He's an editor of a new imprint,
Mercury.

08:56.551 --> 08:58.172
And this is Bob and Julia,

08:58.241 --> 08:59.862
Caitlin's roommate's parents.

08:59.931 --> 09:01.931
- And responsible
for introducing these two.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.551
- Everyone, uh,
this is Michelle and Tom.

09:04.620 --> 09:07.758
They are very good friends
from Paramus, New Jersey.

09:07.827 --> 09:09.448
- Very, very nice to meet you,

09:09.517 --> 09:11.034
Charles...
- Brooks.

09:11.103 --> 09:12.931
- Liza, you haven't been
hiding away this man

09:13.000 --> 09:14.758
from your nearest and dearest,
have you?

09:14.827 --> 09:16.310
- Of course not.

09:16.379 --> 09:18.793
There's, uh, nothing
to hide here.

09:18.862 --> 09:22.344
- Yeah, there real--
there really isn't.

09:22.413 --> 09:25.482
- Now, that is a tux.

09:25.551 --> 09:28.448
- You know, we're double-balling
this weekend.

09:28.517 --> 09:29.724
- Excuse me?

09:29.793 --> 09:31.275
- Well, Charles invited us
to this,

09:31.344 --> 09:34.862
and then we invited you to
the Legal Eagles Gala tomorrow.

09:34.931 --> 09:36.310
- Oh, I didn't realize
that was tomorrow.

09:36.379 --> 09:38.689
- Yeah, you'll be fine.
You can wear the same dress.

09:38.758 --> 09:40.344
It's a whole different crowd.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.793
- Oh, great.

09:41.862 --> 09:43.758
- We are such ballers.

09:43.827 --> 09:46.758
- Ha.

09:46.827 --> 09:48.724
- Do you mind if
I crash for a bit?

09:48.793 --> 09:51.551
My table is so boring.
- Of course.

09:51.620 --> 09:53.448
- I am so proud of you, honey.

09:53.517 --> 09:55.241
- What, why?

09:55.310 --> 09:56.379
Oh.

09:56.448 --> 09:59.724
- I mean, that young kid
was adorable.

09:59.793 --> 10:01.862
But now,
you're past the crazy phase.

10:01.931 --> 10:03.620
You're with
someone who's appropriate

10:03.689 --> 10:05.068
who we can all hang out with.

10:05.137 --> 10:06.758
- Josh wasn't a crazy phase.

10:06.827 --> 10:08.551
- Oh, stop apologizing.
- I'm not.

10:08.620 --> 10:11.862
- You know, after the divorce,
I kind of felt sorry for you.

10:11.931 --> 10:15.275
But now, I'm jealous.

10:15.344 --> 10:16.586
He's a keeper.

10:31.931 --> 10:33.137
- Ooh, look who's here.

10:33.206 --> 10:35.620
Cinderella is back
from the ball.

10:35.689 --> 10:38.172
- Yeah, slippers intact.
- How was it?

10:38.241 --> 10:41.551
- Uh, well, this
about sums up the night.

10:41.620 --> 10:43.379
Look who I ran into.

10:43.827 --> 10:45.275
- Oh, my God!

10:45.344 --> 10:47.620
It's like "The Real Housewives
of New Jersey."

10:47.689 --> 10:49.896
- Yep, my worlds are colliding,

10:49.965 --> 10:53.413
and it all feels strangely...
familiar.

10:53.482 --> 10:55.000
- I get it.

10:55.068 --> 10:57.448
It's like you only had
chocolate ice cream for 20 years

10:57.517 --> 11:00.827
and then you got divorced
and tried all these new flavors,

11:00.896 --> 11:03.586
pistachio, guava,
cookies and cream.

11:03.655 --> 11:06.000
And now it's like you're with
chocolate chocolate chip.

11:06.068 --> 11:07.793
- But I like chocolate.
- Sure.

11:07.862 --> 11:09.068
Better than vanilla.

11:09.137 --> 11:11.965
- Where you going?

11:12.034 --> 11:13.689
- Oh, I'm going out
with Josh and Lauren.

11:13.758 --> 11:15.689
- It's after 11:00.
- Exactly.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.413
Good night.
Don't wait up.

11:17.482 --> 11:18.517
- Night.

11:56.793 --> 11:58.000
Hey!
- Hey.

11:58.068 --> 11:59.482
- I haven't seen
that beauty in a while.

11:59.551 --> 12:00.793
- Yeah, well you're not gonna
be seeing her

12:00.862 --> 12:02.034
much more after this.

12:02.103 --> 12:03.931
I officially found a buyer
for her.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.379
- What? Why?
You love that bike.

12:05.448 --> 12:07.862
- Yeah, I kind of been
rethinking my priorities

12:07.931 --> 12:09.448
now that Gemma's around.

12:09.517 --> 12:11.172
It's like, God forbid
something happens to me,

12:11.241 --> 12:14.068
then it directly affects her.

12:14.137 --> 12:16.310
I get anxious even
thinking about it, honestly.

12:16.379 --> 12:18.137
- Welcome to
the rest of your life.

12:18.206 --> 12:20.965
- Hey, you want to go
for one last spin?

12:21.034 --> 12:22.620
Huh?

12:22.689 --> 12:24.517
- I'm dropping her off
to the buyer this afternoon.

12:24.586 --> 12:29.137
- I would love to, but
I am slammed at work today.

12:29.206 --> 12:30.965
She really is a beauty though.

12:31.034 --> 12:32.965
- Yeah, she is.

12:33.034 --> 12:35.448
I got someone
much more beautiful

12:35.517 --> 12:37.758
in my life now though.

12:37.827 --> 12:39.586
- Yeah.

12:47.103 --> 12:50.172
Okay, Meghan Markle
has nothing on you.

12:50.241 --> 12:53.068
- Well, aside from that
royal redhead, that may be true.

12:53.137 --> 12:55.586
- What's the occasion?
Wait, is there an occasion?

12:55.655 --> 12:57.068
- Of course there is.

12:57.137 --> 12:59.068
I'm going to a christening
this afternoon.

12:59.137 --> 13:01.344
Enzo's niece.
In Staten Island.

13:01.413 --> 13:03.551
- Wow, you are going to
make quite the impression.

13:03.620 --> 13:06.758
- It's a low bar, Liza,
but I try to lead by example.

13:06.827 --> 13:09.379
- Aw.

13:09.448 --> 13:11.965
- And finally, the book
we're most excited about:

13:12.034 --> 13:13.931
"Arabian Sea."

13:14.000 --> 13:15.448
Basically it's
"Master and Commander"

13:15.517 --> 13:17.241
in the world of
modern-day pirates.

13:17.310 --> 13:19.172
- We haven't had a good
seafaring book in a while.

13:19.241 --> 13:20.965
- Mm, I think there may be
a reason for that.

13:21.034 --> 13:24.310
- Well, with sea levels rising,
it seems very relevant.

13:24.379 --> 13:26.206
- Is there a woman in the book?

13:26.275 --> 13:28.655
- At the moment, no, but we can
discuss it with the writer.

13:28.724 --> 13:30.379
- You know what? Never mind.
I'm sure I'd be

13:30.448 --> 13:32.275
worried about her
on the ship the entire time.

13:32.344 --> 13:36.068
- Either way, you don't
want to pass on this one.

13:36.137 --> 13:39.620
- What do you think, Kels'?

13:39.689 --> 13:41.965
- You know,
it's our first title together,

13:42.034 --> 13:44.206
and I was really
hoping for something...

13:44.275 --> 13:47.137
sexier out of you guys.

13:47.206 --> 13:48.896
- Well, there is a sextant.

13:49.965 --> 13:51.241
- The real love story

13:51.310 --> 13:53.931
is between the captain
and the sea.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.034
- I'm sorry, it's a no for me.

13:56.103 --> 13:58.344
- You just want to kill
everything, don't you?

13:58.413 --> 14:01.862
I mean, what are we
even doing here?

14:01.931 --> 14:04.517
- Oh.

14:08.172 --> 14:10.448
Well, I'm just being honest
like you said,

14:10.517 --> 14:12.551
and it's not
making me any friends.

14:12.620 --> 14:14.241
- Well, you did kill
their entire slate.

14:14.310 --> 14:16.000
- Well, I'm looking for
something romantic,

14:16.068 --> 14:17.344
something commercial, like

14:17.413 --> 14:19.241
a John Grisham
or a Nicholas Sparks.

14:19.310 --> 14:21.586
- What if I told you
that Charles does have a book?

14:21.655 --> 14:23.586
It's totally on par
with Nicholas Sparks.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.689
It's set in the Hamptons,
about a college kid

14:25.758 --> 14:27.206
working on a lobster boat

14:27.275 --> 14:29.724
who has an affair with
a wealthy, older, married woman.

14:29.793 --> 14:31.034
- Now, that's interesting.

14:31.103 --> 14:33.137
Why did Charles
not pitch me that?

14:33.206 --> 14:34.896
- I'm not sure
he even knows he has it.

14:34.965 --> 14:36.241
I found the manuscript
in some boxes

14:36.310 --> 14:37.827
that got sent over
from Pound Ridge.

14:37.896 --> 14:39.482
- Well, who's the writer?

14:39.551 --> 14:40.758
How do we know that it hasn't
already been published?

14:40.827 --> 14:41.931
- I checked.
It hasn't.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.000
Possibly because
it's not finished.

14:44.068 --> 14:47.172
- You want me to consider
an old, unfinished novel, Liza?

14:47.241 --> 14:48.862
- It's really commercial,
and if you respond,

14:48.931 --> 14:51.413
we can have Charles get back
in contact with the writer.

14:51.482 --> 14:52.862
- Does he even know that
you're giving this to me?

14:52.931 --> 14:54.517
- He doesn't even know
that I found it.

14:54.586 --> 14:55.931
Just read it.

14:56.000 --> 14:58.137
And if you don't like it,
don't mention it to Charles.

14:58.206 --> 14:59.310
He doesn't need another pass.

15:03.931 --> 15:07.965
- Welcome all to
the baptism of Khloe DeLuca.

15:08.034 --> 15:10.310
Now, through baptism
God enables us

15:10.379 --> 15:12.000
to participate in his life
and purifies us from sin

15:12.068 --> 15:13.931
and purifies us from sin.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.862
- You look beautiful.

15:15.931 --> 15:17.172
- Thank you.

15:17.241 --> 15:20.172
I wanted to look nice
for your family.

15:20.241 --> 15:22.103
- You knocked it
out of the park.

15:22.172 --> 15:24.172
- At the very dawn of
creation...

15:24.241 --> 15:26.344
- Are those, um,
real bird feathers?

15:26.413 --> 15:28.965
- Oh, they better be.

15:29.034 --> 15:31.103
- And now, I ask the godparents,

15:31.172 --> 15:35.137
Enzo DeLuca and Maria Battiata
to join us.

15:35.206 --> 15:36.310
- You're the godfather?

15:36.379 --> 15:38.689
- Yeah.
It's a big honor.

15:45.000 --> 15:46.689
- She's gorgeous, isn't she?

15:46.758 --> 15:48.241
- Oh, well, all babies are.

15:48.310 --> 15:49.448
- Waters of the great flood...

15:49.517 --> 15:50.482
- I guess.

15:50.551 --> 15:52.517
- I--I mean Maria,
the godmother.

15:52.586 --> 15:54.344
She and Enzo went out
for a while.

15:54.413 --> 15:57.689
I really thought
they'd end up together.

15:57.758 --> 15:59.517
- Really?

15:59.586 --> 16:01.724
What happened?

16:01.793 --> 16:03.827
- It almost hit the year mark,

16:03.896 --> 16:06.206
and then, boom, Enzo's out.

16:06.275 --> 16:08.724
Happens with all his girlfriends
after a year.

16:08.793 --> 16:10.241
It's his pattern.

16:10.310 --> 16:12.344
He's like the George Clooney
of the family.

16:12.413 --> 16:15.551
- Yes, well, George did
eventually marry Amal.

16:15.620 --> 16:18.931
Yeah, well, she's Amal.

16:20.689 --> 16:24.137
- So that his son might be
the eldest of many brothers...

16:57.862 --> 16:59.689
- ♪ We're living in a fantasy ♪

17:07.241 --> 17:09.551
♪ We're living in a fantasy ♪

17:09.620 --> 17:12.448
♪ Are we really free? ♪

17:12.517 --> 17:17.482
♪ You gotta be you
I gotta be me ♪

17:19.000 --> 17:20.689
- Charles, hey,
before you leave.

17:20.758 --> 17:23.448
I finally found a book that
I'm excited about from you.

17:23.517 --> 17:25.448
- Really? Which one?
- Liza slipped it to me.

17:25.517 --> 17:28.827
She found it in one of your
old boxes from Pound Ridge?

17:28.896 --> 17:32.137
- Can I see that?

17:32.206 --> 17:35.068
- It reads like a more
sophisticated Nicholas Sparks.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.827
Can we find the writer and make
a deal with him to finish it?

17:37.896 --> 17:42.517
- It's... really not something
that I'm interested in pursuing.

17:45.448 --> 17:49.034
As publisher, I am.

17:49.103 --> 17:53.137
- And as the author,
I most certainly am not.

18:02.517 --> 18:04.965
- You didn't mention
you dated the godmother.

18:05.034 --> 18:07.103
- Maria?
That was a while ago.

18:07.172 --> 18:09.000
Lasted about a year.

18:09.068 --> 18:12.517
- Well, I guess
we have about four months left.

18:12.586 --> 18:13.482
- Excuse me?

18:13.551 --> 18:14.482
- Oh, according to your sister,

18:14.551 --> 18:16.931
you have a year expiration date.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.620
- Let's get a picture.

18:18.689 --> 18:20.758
- We need to put
the godparents together

18:20.827 --> 18:21.896
close to the baby.

18:21.965 --> 18:23.793
Diana, come.
- Ma...

18:25.965 --> 18:27.275
- Here.

18:27.344 --> 18:29.068
See, the lighting
is much better for you...

18:29.137 --> 18:30.413
- Is it?
- Here.

18:34.137 --> 18:35.586
- Everyone, squeeze.

18:35.655 --> 18:37.172
- Oh, there's a bush here.
- Squeeze, squeeze.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.551
- Hold on a minute.

18:39.620 --> 18:41.310
Are you okay?

18:41.379 --> 18:43.586
Fine, I'm fine.

18:43.655 --> 18:45.137
Dolce, but I'm fine.

18:45.206 --> 18:46.862
You know what?
I'm just--I'm gonna go home.

18:46.931 --> 18:48.448
- No, no, come with me.

18:48.517 --> 18:50.655
No, she's gonna be next to me.
- Enzo, stop, it's--

18:50.724 --> 18:54.896
- Enzo, these pictures are gonna
stay in the family forever.

18:54.965 --> 18:59.862
- And, so I hope, will Diana.

19:02.827 --> 19:05.620
- Oh, marone.

19:05.689 --> 19:09.034
- Diana, will you marry me?

19:12.103 --> 19:15.172
- Is there... a ring involved?

19:15.241 --> 19:18.000
- I'm being spontaneous here.

19:18.068 --> 19:20.413
- Oh, what's the rush?

19:20.482 --> 19:22.344
Let her think about it.

19:22.413 --> 19:25.724
- She can take
all the time she needs.

19:30.896 --> 19:32.413
- Yes.

19:41.206 --> 19:43.172
- Oh, God, it's so beautiful.

19:43.241 --> 19:46.448
I love seeing the city
like this.

19:46.517 --> 19:48.931
- Like, I know
you're with him, but

19:49.000 --> 19:51.379
I'm glad we can still
spend time together like this.

19:51.448 --> 19:54.172
- Yeah, me too.

19:56.655 --> 19:59.586
You know, I've been reading
a book that reminds me of us.

19:59.655 --> 20:01.965
- Really?
Tell me more.

20:02.034 --> 20:03.344
- It's about a younger man

20:03.413 --> 20:04.655
who has an affair
with an older woman.

20:04.724 --> 20:08.655
- Oh, an affair, huh?
Sounds racy.

20:08.724 --> 20:10.586
- It actually is
pretty sexy in parts.

20:10.655 --> 20:13.103
- Oh, I bet it is.

20:13.172 --> 20:14.482
So how does it end?

20:14.551 --> 20:17.103
- Oh, that's a big question.
- Mm.

20:17.172 --> 20:20.275
- The writer didn't
finish the book.

20:20.344 --> 20:22.379
- I love it, like,
the reader has to figure out

20:22.448 --> 20:24.000
the ending for themselves, huh?

20:24.068 --> 20:27.689
- Yeah, it's like a "choose
your own adventure" romance.

20:30.586 --> 20:32.931
- Well, how do you
think it ends?

20:35.724 --> 20:39.965
- I don't know.

20:40.034 --> 20:42.586
- Yeah, yeah...

20:51.137 --> 20:52.206
- Wow.

20:52.275 --> 20:54.068
-  Hi.
- Hi.

20:56.896 --> 20:59.206
Where'd you disappear to
this afternoon?

20:59.275 --> 21:01.206
- I was playing hooky.

21:01.275 --> 21:03.379
I needed to cut loose
for a few hours.

21:03.448 --> 21:07.172
- Mm, you mean
you had to disappear

21:07.241 --> 21:09.758
while Kelsey read the manuscript

21:09.827 --> 21:12.827
that you found in
my personal papers?

21:12.896 --> 21:14.172
You were snooping.

21:14.241 --> 21:15.965
- No, honestly,
the box, it just fell open--

21:16.034 --> 21:20.172
and--and I read it and it was
such a beautiful story and I...

21:20.241 --> 21:23.310
Yes, I was snooping.

21:23.379 --> 21:26.689
- Liza, the summer I turned 21,
I had an affair

21:26.758 --> 21:29.310
with the wife of
a famous author.

21:29.379 --> 21:32.241
She was beautiful
but dissatisfied.

21:32.310 --> 21:35.206
She was always
looking over her shoulder.

21:35.275 --> 21:38.206
And she thought that
a fling with a younger man

21:38.275 --> 21:41.275
would make her feel young too.

21:41.344 --> 21:44.448
And for a while, it was
exciting for both of us.

21:44.517 --> 21:46.241
It's the part you read.

21:46.310 --> 21:48.068
- You wrote the book.

21:48.137 --> 21:51.620
- Everyone's got one novel.
- Why didn't you finish it?

21:51.689 --> 21:55.551
- Because in the end, I realized
it would hurt too many people.

21:55.620 --> 21:58.275
- Still, the writing
was wonderful.

21:58.344 --> 22:01.000
- I'm not really a writer.

22:01.068 --> 22:02.275
But I knew what it was like

22:02.344 --> 22:05.034
to be that young, heedless man.

22:05.103 --> 22:08.206
And I understood the mind
of a woman in her 40s

22:08.275 --> 22:10.689
who was bored with her life

22:10.758 --> 22:15.206
and who needed his validation.

22:15.275 --> 22:16.517
- Charles!

22:16.586 --> 22:18.448
Liza.

22:22.551 --> 22:24.517
I really don't want to go
to this party, do you?

22:26.344 --> 22:27.931
Can we promise each other
one thing?

22:28.000 --> 22:29.137
- Of course.

22:29.206 --> 22:30.413
- That in the future,
we never ever

22:30.482 --> 22:32.413
do anything together
we don't want to do.

22:34.793 --> 22:36.827
- Why wait?

22:36.896 --> 22:38.206
Let's make a run for it.

22:38.275 --> 22:40.344
- What?
- Run.

22:40.413 --> 22:42.793
- ♪ One foot in front of
the other ♪

22:42.862 --> 22:46.103
-  Oh, my God.

22:49.586 --> 22:52.241
- ♪ One foot in front of
the other ♪
