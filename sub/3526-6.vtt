02:58.645 --> 03:02.411
- l'm laying out. You coming?
- The UV index is 10.

03:02.448 --> 03:05.679
Jesus, we don't do anything.
We don't eat.

03:05.718 --> 03:09.085
We don't go out.
God knows we don't do anything else.

03:09.122 --> 03:11.989
ls that all you
ever think about, sex?

03:12.025 --> 03:15.654
All l ever think about?
You haven't fucked me in over a year.

03:15.695 --> 03:19.153
Blood sugar, l told you,
the weight loss.

03:20.667 --> 03:25.263
Good, fine.
Skin cancer.

03:30.710 --> 03:34.077
What's up?

03:36.849 --> 03:38.612
Thing we talked
about at the wedding.

03:38.651 --> 03:39.811
Rusty.

03:39.852 --> 03:41.444
You made the call
to ltaly.

03:41.487 --> 03:43.955
Our friend over there's
gonna fit him for a suit.

03:43.990 --> 03:46.185
She's sending over
two of her best tailors.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.319
So l should meet 'em
at the airport?

03:48.361 --> 03:50.852
No, they're gonna call
you when they arrive.

03:50.897 --> 03:53.798
Now you hook 'em up
with a third party, huh?

03:53.833 --> 03:57.166
Get 'em some scissors.

03:57.203 --> 04:00.172
This is smart, Ton',
the more l think about it.

04:00.206 --> 04:01.764
Glad you approve.

04:01.808 --> 04:04.641
Anybody taking a look,
there's nothing linking us to it.

04:04.677 --> 04:06.645
- Hey, good seeing you.
- Hey, there he is.

04:06.679 --> 04:09.341
- How you doing?
- What's up?

04:09.382 --> 04:12.374
How are you?

04:12.418 --> 04:16.320
Listen,
come here a minute.

04:16.356 --> 04:18.415
About the other day...

04:18.458 --> 04:20.426
l'm fine.
A couple of stitches.

04:20.459 --> 04:24.089
Yeah? My fucking
temper, you know?

04:24.130 --> 04:26.189
No no no no,
it's okay, really.

04:26.232 --> 04:28.564
Take it.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.501
Thanks.

04:30.536 --> 04:32.936
Look, Ton',

04:32.972 --> 04:35.338
l don't remember slamming
the refrigerator door,

04:35.375 --> 04:37.741
but Carlo told me
and my dad,

04:37.777 --> 04:41.907
l never should have raised my hands
to you. l'm sorry.

04:41.948 --> 04:44.644
As long as
you realize.

04:44.684 --> 04:47.312
Huh?

04:47.353 --> 04:50.186
lt basically became
the same thing every day.

04:50.223 --> 04:52.521
Coffee,
couple lines of meth,

04:52.558 --> 04:55.959
smooth that out
with a shot of Jameson.

04:55.995 --> 04:59.226
And that was just
to drive the kids to school.

05:01.367 --> 05:06.236
Then one day l fell asleep at work
and forgot about Gracie's recital.

05:10.310 --> 05:14.576
Human frailty, it makes
me sick sometimes.

05:19.886 --> 05:23.913
- Chris, right?
- Should l know you?

05:23.956 --> 05:26.481
Kevin Mucci, Yonkers.

05:26.526 --> 05:29.051
We met at the Trotters.
Sal lacuzzo's cousin.

05:29.095 --> 05:30.790
- Right. Hey.
- Hey.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.422
Yonkers,
what are you, lost?

05:32.465 --> 05:35.229
My ex's birthday over
at the Red Robin in Clifton.

05:35.268 --> 05:36.860
l figured l'd need a meeting
to make it through that shit.

05:36.903 --> 05:39.269
l hear that.

05:39.305 --> 05:41.330
So l saw my cousin
this week.

05:41.374 --> 05:45.367
lt turns out he ran into a friend
of yours, the big guy, Vito.

05:45.411 --> 05:47.811
And...

05:47.847 --> 05:51.647
He was in a fag bar,
dancing with a guy.

05:52.752 --> 05:54.686
Get the fuck out!

06:07.100 --> 06:10.592
Right, Joey, use your head.

06:10.636 --> 06:12.729
You are not gonna
fucking believe this.

06:12.772 --> 06:15.002
Vito Spatafore's
an ass-muncher.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.771
- Oh! What?
- What did you just say?

06:17.810 --> 06:19.471
l'm sorry, it's true.

06:19.512 --> 06:23.949
We ran into this kid. Vito was spotted
in a fag bar in New York.

06:23.983 --> 06:25.848
By who?

06:25.885 --> 06:29.150
The kid's cousin.
Allegedly.

06:29.188 --> 06:30.849
Probably bullshit.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.415
- He's a married man.
- With a goomar.

06:33.459 --> 06:35.518
All right,
back up a second.

06:35.561 --> 06:37.529
What did the kid
say exactly?

06:37.563 --> 06:41.431
- The kid's cousin Sal lacuzzo--
- From Yonkers, l know him.

06:41.467 --> 06:45.494
Sal was at this place in the city,
supposedly on business.

06:45.538 --> 06:48.371
He saw Vito holding hands
with a guy in nipple rings.

06:48.408 --> 06:50.501
You're leaving out
the best part.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.744
He was wearing
a motorcycle outfit,

06:54.781 --> 06:57.306
like the guy in the Village People
with the leather hat

06:57.350 --> 07:00.319
- and the vest.
- Chaps too.

07:04.056 --> 07:06.854
l don't know.
Fucking slander, ask me.

07:08.728 --> 07:10.787
All right, let's take this
in the back.

07:10.830 --> 07:14.493
- Yeah, that's what Vito did.
- You can go.

07:17.737 --> 07:20.900
Tell you one thing, if it was me this
kid was spreading rumors about,

07:20.940 --> 07:22.840
he'd have something up
his own ass.

07:22.875 --> 07:24.638
And it wouldn't be
no cock, either.

07:24.677 --> 07:26.975
That's the point,
though.

07:27.013 --> 07:29.174
This guy Sal,
l know him.

07:29.215 --> 07:33.208
- He's a friend of ours.
- l fucking called it, long time ago.

07:33.252 --> 07:35.345
You knew Vito
was a recchion'?

07:35.388 --> 07:37.083
- Yes.
- When?

07:37.123 --> 07:39.023
l never said it,
but l knew.

07:39.058 --> 07:41.083
Get the fuck out.
Enough of this rush to judgment.

07:41.127 --> 07:44.221
For all we know, this fucking Sal guy's
got a hard-on for Vito.

07:45.431 --> 07:47.661
Oh, you think
this is funny, huh?

07:47.700 --> 07:49.861
There's a man's reputation
at stake here.

07:49.902 --> 07:51.529
A married man,
with kids.

07:51.571 --> 07:54.870
Nah, that don't mean shit.
Elton John was married.

07:54.907 --> 07:57.375
Yeah, Rock Hudson too.
l think.

07:57.410 --> 08:01.437
So what do we gotta do, Ton',
actually see him take it in the ass?

08:01.481 --> 08:04.780
Get Vito
on the phone.

08:08.254 --> 08:10.950
You know, he called me
the other night.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.117
3:00 in the morning,
after the wedding.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.820
And?

08:14.861 --> 08:18.297
Honestly, it was weird.
He wanted to know what was going on.

08:18.331 --> 08:21.095
He was fucking fishing,
see if we heard.

08:22.935 --> 08:25.267
Straight to voice mail.

08:25.304 --> 08:27.534
Ton', l mean,
he represents us.

08:27.573 --> 08:29.541
l'm not gonna condemn
the man off the word

08:29.575 --> 08:31.566
of some fucking douchebag
from Yonkers.

08:31.611 --> 08:35.842
- l could care less, basically.
- Yeah? Maybe you're a flambe.

08:35.881 --> 08:37.941
Fucking nauseating.

08:37.984 --> 08:41.078
lt was up to me, l'd drag Vito behind
my fucking car right now.

08:41.120 --> 08:44.453
Will you take it easy over there,
fucking Judge Roy Bean?

08:44.490 --> 08:46.754
One of my bar girls
knows his goomar.

08:46.792 --> 08:50.319
We'll check with her. Maybe she's seen
him and knows where he is.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.830
Loren.

08:57.436 --> 08:59.870
Think about it,
though, Ton'--

08:59.906 --> 09:02.704
sudden weight loss.

09:02.742 --> 09:05.802
- AlDS?
- Nobody's got AlDS.

09:05.845 --> 09:09.440
l don't wanna hear
that word in here again!

09:11.551 --> 09:14.679
The Federal Prosecutor's office won't
tell you why your son's being held?

09:14.720 --> 09:18.212
Or where. lt has been four days
now since he's been arrested,

09:18.257 --> 09:20.452
and we have no money
to hire a lawyer.

09:20.493 --> 09:23.018
- How did you hear about the law center?
- You will write the...

09:23.062 --> 09:25.257
Habeas corpus?
l'm not an attorney yet.

09:25.298 --> 09:28.324
l'm a volunteer assistant.
One of our attorneys will file the writ.

09:28.367 --> 09:32.167
- He is a good boy.
- The FBl went to his school

09:32.204 --> 09:34.695
and took him like a criminal.
This is America?

09:34.740 --> 09:37.470
lt's not easy
to be Muslim now.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.671
They wouldn't let Afaf skate
at the local rink

09:39.712 --> 09:43.113
- unless she removed her headscarf.
- You're kidding me, why?

09:43.149 --> 09:45.117
They said it was
for insurance.

09:45.151 --> 09:47.119
lt might fall off
and someone could trip.

09:47.153 --> 09:50.350
lf she had been wearing a yarmulke,
it would have been a different story.

09:50.389 --> 09:52.380
You can bet.

09:54.327 --> 09:56.295
They're these poor,
hardworking people.

09:56.329 --> 09:58.661
- Finn, you're not eating?
- Coffee's good.

09:58.698 --> 10:01.189
The government is just completely
fucking this family over.

10:01.233 --> 10:03.599
When did it start she could use that
kind of language

10:03.636 --> 10:05.501
in this house
with immunity?

10:05.538 --> 10:08.302
l'm telling Mom about these people
that came in yesterday.

10:08.341 --> 10:11.742
Let me guess, was it a crack
whore trying to get her kids back

10:11.777 --> 10:13.404
for the welfare money?

10:13.446 --> 10:16.142
Actually, it was a family from
Afghanistan who fled the Taliban

10:16.182 --> 10:17.979
and sweated out
Visa lotteries

10:18.017 --> 10:21.578
in a refugee camp,
and hold down three jobs.

10:21.621 --> 10:25.148
You think it's funny? The FBl
snatched their son off the street

10:25.191 --> 10:27.421
like we're some
third-world dictatorship.

10:27.460 --> 10:28.825
Pretty scary.

10:28.861 --> 10:30.726
There must have
been some reason, Meadow.

10:30.763 --> 10:32.958
- Like he's a terrorist, maybe.
- 9-11, 9-11.

10:32.999 --> 10:36.400
Bush is using it as an excuse to erode
our Constitutional protections,

10:36.435 --> 10:39.768
- and you're falling for it.
- Well, l voted for him.

10:39.805 --> 10:44.105
Right, well, you don't
relate to black people clinging to logs.

10:48.180 --> 10:50.774
You oughta chill out
about some of this.

10:57.156 --> 10:59.147
Hey.

11:05.765 --> 11:07.892
Let me ask you
something,

11:07.933 --> 11:11.027
those two Arabs

11:11.070 --> 11:14.506
with the credit cards,
Fazool and whatever his name is--

11:14.540 --> 11:15.871
Yeah?

11:15.908 --> 11:19.366
you think there's a chance
they could be...

11:19.412 --> 11:22.074
l don't know, Al-Qaedas,
something like that?

11:22.114 --> 11:25.914
Hmm.

11:25.951 --> 11:29.944
You know at one point
it did cross my mind.

11:29.989 --> 11:31.752
Yeah, and?

11:31.791 --> 11:34.089
l don't think so.

11:34.126 --> 11:36.651
They're gun nuts
but the smaller guy Ahmed,

11:36.696 --> 11:38.823
when those Danish cartoons
got published,

11:38.864 --> 11:40.798
he was very upset,
but at the protestors.

11:40.833 --> 11:42.801
He said he hated
the cartoons

11:42.835 --> 11:46.271
but that the rioting shit would just
bring bad attention to all Muslims.

11:46.305 --> 11:48.398
And the other guy
Mohammed, his brother's

11:48.441 --> 11:50.136
a government interrogator
in Lebanon

11:50.176 --> 11:52.440
or Syria.

11:52.478 --> 11:55.106
Plus Mohammed and his
girlfriend have a dog,

11:55.147 --> 11:57.274
a springer spaniel.

11:59.752 --> 12:01.720
l'm gonna get a coffee.

12:28.614 --> 12:31.447
Vito, what the fuck
you doing?

12:31.484 --> 12:33.452
- Tony's looking for you.
- For me?

12:33.486 --> 12:35.477
He's been calling
for fucking days.

12:35.521 --> 12:38.513
My goddamn phone, Jesus. Everything all
right?

12:38.557 --> 12:40.320
You tell us.

12:40.359 --> 12:43.556
l'm good.
Tell Tony l'll call him.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.759
lt's better you come in.

12:46.799 --> 12:48.767
Sure.

12:50.236 --> 12:52.898
You go ahead,
and l'll follow you.

13:01.881 --> 13:03.314
- What?
- Ho!

13:03.349 --> 13:05.340
- Where the fuck...
- What are you doing?!

13:05.384 --> 13:07.011
Motherfucker!

13:07.052 --> 13:09.145
Fucking finook.

13:10.189 --> 13:13.386
Lying piece of shit.

13:13.425 --> 13:16.019
Better not come
around here no more.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.751
Hey.

13:40.786 --> 13:44.119
You speak ltal, right?

13:44.156 --> 13:46.215
Some friends
coming over from Naples,

13:46.258 --> 13:48.692
paying a visit to a guy
from New York.

13:48.727 --> 13:53.027
- Who?
- The little guy in Ozone Park.

13:55.100 --> 13:57.091
That's pretty high up.

13:58.537 --> 14:01.028
You should provide 'em
a couple of dumb gats,

14:01.073 --> 14:02.973
guidance on where
to find him.

14:03.008 --> 14:05.306
How do l get
ahold of them?

14:05.344 --> 14:08.677
Just leave your phone on.

14:08.714 --> 14:10.944
Part two when it's done.

14:17.656 --> 14:20.386
l hear fat Vito's been riding up
the Hershey Highway.

14:20.426 --> 14:23.259
- Where'd you get that?
- Come on.

14:23.295 --> 14:25.786
Somebody started a joke.
l won't mention any names.

14:25.831 --> 14:27.958
- There's no truth to it.
- Oh.

14:29.969 --> 14:32.563
lt's a fucking captain
you're talking about.

14:35.207 --> 14:38.836
People went to see him.
He was down the shore with his goomar.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.812
So it's bullshit then.

14:43.048 --> 14:45.846
As soon as he saw 'em,
took off like a bat out of hell.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.682
Fuck.

14:47.720 --> 14:49.688
You didn't hear it
from me.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.690
lt could be
a mid-life thing.

14:51.724 --> 14:55.125
Sucking a cock?

14:58.898 --> 15:00.866
Mr. Spatafore, hey.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.959
Marie's still at the hospital
with her mom.

15:03.002 --> 15:06.836
- Kids asleep?
- They went to sleep about an hour ago.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.908
Fuck!

17:56.608 --> 17:58.337
Hi.
How are you doing?

17:58.377 --> 18:00.641
l need a room
for the night.

18:00.679 --> 18:02.840
l don't have anybody down
for a reservation.

18:02.881 --> 18:04.872
The sign said ''Vacancy.''

18:04.917 --> 18:08.944
Oh, we have rooms. We usually don't
get walk-ins. Come in.

18:18.664 --> 18:21.758
Glad to have you. Slow around here until
the leaf peepers show up.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.495
Let me show you
where we serve breakfast.

18:23.535 --> 18:25.025
l just want to go to my room.

18:25.070 --> 18:27.834
No problem. lt's $140,
breakfast included.

18:27.873 --> 18:30.671
- MasterCard or Visa.
- l'll pay cash.

18:30.709 --> 18:32.939
We accept that too.

18:32.978 --> 18:35.276
But you can take care
of it in the morning.

18:35.314 --> 18:39.614
l'm just beat,
that's all.

18:39.651 --> 18:41.482
My car broke down.

18:41.520 --> 18:44.011
On a night
like this too.

18:44.056 --> 18:46.115
You know, my stepson
runs the tow service.

18:46.158 --> 18:50.618
You want, early morning, l can have
your rig brought to the Mobil.

18:50.662 --> 18:52.721
Yeah?

18:52.764 --> 18:54.561
Black Cadillac.

18:54.600 --> 18:58.092
- Route 228.
- Mm-hmm.

19:00.305 --> 19:02.398
This is for you.

19:04.510 --> 19:06.501
Have a good night.

19:09.982 --> 19:13.543
Franklin Pierce room.
Up the stairs, first door to the right.

20:39.771 --> 20:42.865
l was just over at the house.
Everything is gone.

20:42.908 --> 20:46.708
- Which house are you referring to?
- The spec house.

20:46.745 --> 20:49.839
The PVC,
the shake-roof shingles,

20:49.881 --> 20:52.509
even that expensive
lock on the shed is missing.

20:52.551 --> 20:54.576
That's awful, Mel.

20:54.620 --> 20:56.451
You don't know
anything about this?

20:58.090 --> 21:00.251
You left it there
to rot.

21:00.292 --> 21:02.624
l don't believe this.

21:02.661 --> 21:06.461
- With my husband on his deathbed...
- Oh, Sarah Bernhardt.

21:06.498 --> 21:09.899
...you went over there and you picked
through the place like a vulture!

21:09.935 --> 21:12.460
You said you'd straighten out the
permits with the building department

21:12.504 --> 21:15.337
- and you never did.
- That is beside the point!

21:15.374 --> 21:17.239
Carmela, what happened
to my bundt pan?

21:17.276 --> 21:20.143
lt was your fault the permits
were denied in the first place.

21:20.178 --> 21:23.375
You're a broken record, for God's sake.
That's what you are.

21:23.415 --> 21:25.144
Carmela, wait.

21:25.183 --> 21:29.711
No, let her go.
l've had a lifetime of her bullshit.

21:40.866 --> 21:42.731
Gimme a coffee.

21:52.010 --> 21:54.240
National directory.
City and state?

21:54.279 --> 21:56.304
Peterborough,
New Hampshire.

21:56.348 --> 21:58.873
The number
for Angelo Di Piazza.

21:58.917 --> 22:02.683
- Double ''Z.''
- No number listed, sir.

22:02.721 --> 22:04.689
How about
Roberta Di Piazza?

22:04.723 --> 22:06.850
Nothing for
Roberta Di Piazza.

22:06.892 --> 22:09.019
- Huh?
- Nothing, sir.

22:09.061 --> 22:11.962
Could you try
Roberta Spatafore?

22:11.997 --> 22:15.125
S-p-a-t-a-f-o-r-e.

22:15.167 --> 22:18.261
l don't have anything
for that listing, sir.

22:18.303 --> 22:20.635
Look, l'm trying
to find my cousin.

22:20.672 --> 22:22.333
Could you search
the whole state?

22:22.374 --> 22:24.365
Searching.

22:24.409 --> 22:26.502
l'm sorry, sir.

22:38.457 --> 22:41.585
- What's good?
- First time here, try the johnnycakes.

22:41.626 --> 22:44.493
What's that?

22:44.529 --> 22:47.521
Pancake made with white cornmeal.
New England specialty.

22:47.566 --> 22:49.397
Where you from?

22:51.169 --> 22:53.137
Scottsdale.

22:53.171 --> 22:56.766
Well, they're delicious.
Little butter, local syrup.

22:57.843 --> 23:00.676
Okay, and gimme some
of them Jimmy Deans.

23:00.712 --> 23:04.011
Our sausages are
made in-house.

23:12.657 --> 23:15.820
Hey, boys, how'd you guys
make out in the storm?

23:15.861 --> 23:18.125
We lost our lights
in the middle of ''Cold Case.''

23:18.163 --> 23:22.156
We thought we were gonna have to talk
to each other or read a book.

23:22.200 --> 23:24.168
The usual, guys?

23:24.202 --> 23:27.433
- Are we boring?
- Yeah yeah.

23:35.013 --> 23:36.981
Here's your johnnycakes.

23:37.015 --> 23:40.041
l gotta warn ya,
they're addictive.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.076
They look good.

23:56.902 --> 24:00.201
- You want more coffee?
- No, l'm coffeed out.

24:02.574 --> 24:04.508
You don't say hello
to your uncle?

24:04.543 --> 24:07.239
- Hi, Uncle Sil.
- Vito.

24:10.348 --> 24:13.613
Well, he ain't
gonna show.

24:13.652 --> 24:15.620
l'll just
leave him these.

24:15.654 --> 24:19.647
He said he'd be back
from Vegas today. l don't know.

24:23.962 --> 24:26.396
You and Vito,

24:26.431 --> 24:28.296
how are things going
with you guys?

24:28.333 --> 24:30.927
We have our ups
and downs.

24:30.969 --> 24:35.429
And in the romance
department?

24:35.474 --> 24:38.705
Excuse me?

24:38.743 --> 24:41.576
What's this all about?

24:41.613 --> 24:45.049
lt's awkward.

24:45.083 --> 24:48.484
No offense, l really don't want
to talk about this.

24:49.888 --> 24:53.654
Vito's a good father
and a loving husband.

24:53.692 --> 24:56.286
But his mind
is elsewhere.

24:56.328 --> 25:00.094
He takes these
unexplained powders.

25:00.131 --> 25:03.123
He's got a goomar.
l know all about it.

25:05.537 --> 25:08.165
lt's nothing.
Forget about it.

25:10.008 --> 25:11.976
You hear from him,

25:12.010 --> 25:15.776
tell him l brought him
some Blood, Sweat and Tears tickets.

25:18.450 --> 25:20.441
Backstage passes too.

25:34.699 --> 25:36.667
l'm telling ya,

25:36.701 --> 25:39.226
my business,
l'm around a lot of women.

25:39.271 --> 25:41.865
That one ain't
getting laid.

25:59.190 --> 26:02.023
- Hello.
- Vito?

26:02.060 --> 26:03.721
- You got him?
- Who?

26:03.762 --> 26:07.493
- Put Vito on the phone, asshole.
- Fuck you, motherfucker.

26:07.532 --> 26:09.557
What, are you sucking his dick?
Put him on.

26:09.601 --> 26:11.728
How about l kick
your ass, you fucking faggot?

26:11.770 --> 26:15.171
Yeah, that's right, telephone tough-guy.
Put Vito on the phone!

26:15.206 --> 26:18.334
There ain't no Vito, man. l found
the phone on the side of the road.

26:18.376 --> 26:20.970
- What?
- Hang on a second.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.983
Where'd you find the phone?

26:27.018 --> 26:29.384
Hello.

26:29.421 --> 26:31.412
Hello!

26:31.456 --> 26:33.947
Oh, you motherfucker.

26:33.992 --> 26:35.926
What happened?

26:36.061 --> 26:38.222
Bob at the marina
where Tony docks his boat

26:38.263 --> 26:40.788
says he'll donate
a sunset dinner cruise.

26:40.832 --> 26:42.732
- l paid $300 for that?
- Yeah.

26:42.767 --> 26:45.292
l got seasick in Bermuda
on one of those.

26:45.337 --> 26:47.498
- Oh, Angie, finally.
- Sorry.

26:47.539 --> 26:49.234
l had these sales reps
in my office.

26:49.274 --> 26:51.742
We're just going over
the list for the silent auction.

26:51.776 --> 26:55.576
- We're already up to about 7500 bucks.
- Oh good, Artie.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.481
- Ladies.
- A silent auction again?

26:58.516 --> 27:02.350
- Why not get a live auctioneer?
- l got sea bream, beautiful.

27:02.387 --> 27:04.548
Porcini-dusted ravioli,
huh?

27:04.589 --> 27:06.955
l hate to be a pain,
but l gotta get back.

27:06.992 --> 27:08.960
- Can we just let him cook?
- Sure.

27:08.994 --> 27:11.155
Great, go for it.

27:12.697 --> 27:14.324
Where were we?

27:14.366 --> 27:17.267
Jesus Christ.
He's always interrupting.

27:17.302 --> 27:19.463
People enjoy
the silent auction.

27:19.504 --> 27:21.438
l thought our goal
was to raise money.

27:21.473 --> 27:25.170
l say we get 'em liquored up, let 'em
tear each other's throats out.

27:26.444 --> 27:29.004
- Well...
- lt's just an idea.

27:29.047 --> 27:32.881
Anyhow, put me down for $2,000
worth of bodywork and/or paint.

27:32.917 --> 27:35.078
2,000? Madonn', Ange.

27:35.120 --> 27:39.250
So, did you hear about
Vito and Marie? Separated.

27:39.290 --> 27:41.884
Oh, sorry, l gotta take this.

27:43.428 --> 27:44.622
Hello?

27:44.663 --> 27:46.563
They were just at the wedding.
They seemed fine.

27:46.598 --> 27:49.089
What'd l tell you?
ls that a beautiful fish or what?

27:49.134 --> 27:51.295
Oh, for God's sake,
all right!

27:51.336 --> 27:54.237
Can l just get some
prosciutto melon to go?

27:54.272 --> 27:56.467
l'm sorry, guys.
l gotta get back.

27:56.508 --> 28:01.445
No, the quarter panel
from the LeSabre, l said.

28:01.479 --> 28:03.879
Oh shit.

28:03.915 --> 28:05.780
You didn't know
he was gay?

28:10.422 --> 28:13.482
Actually l had him pegged
the whole time, but...

28:15.727 --> 28:17.194
He a close friend?

28:17.228 --> 28:19.492
Not only that, he's one
of my most valuable guys.

28:19.531 --> 28:21.965
He's ambitious,
he's focused.

28:23.201 --> 28:24.668
When l was in
the hospital,

28:24.703 --> 28:27.968
he helped Carmela
tremendously when we were strapped.

28:28.006 --> 28:32.170
You've implied you have
millions of dollars.

28:32.210 --> 28:35.543
Your hospital stay
was actually that costly?

28:35.580 --> 28:39.016
Well no, but, uh...

28:39.050 --> 28:41.644
Huh?

28:41.686 --> 28:44.052
ls that the issue?

28:44.089 --> 28:47.820
You tell me.
What is the issue?

28:47.859 --> 28:50.657
He's a fa-ag!

28:50.695 --> 28:52.458
And?

28:52.497 --> 28:54.124
Now what am l
supposed to do?

28:54.165 --> 28:56.156
About what?

28:56.201 --> 28:58.192
l know what.
They're born that way, right?

28:58.236 --> 29:01.069
lt's not their fault.

29:01.106 --> 29:04.132
Frankly l think they
go about in pity for themselves.

29:04.175 --> 29:07.508
l don't think they
see it as a fault.

29:07.545 --> 29:09.843
ln your circle l'm sure
you got all kinds

29:09.881 --> 29:13.214
of gays
and trans-whatevers

29:13.251 --> 29:14.878
of all stripes.

29:14.919 --> 29:16.978
But not where
l come from.

29:18.123 --> 29:21.490
You personally--

29:21.526 --> 29:24.586
how do you feel
about homosexuality?

29:24.629 --> 29:26.961
l find it disgusting.

29:26.998 --> 29:31.094
Men kissing men,
holding hands in the street.

29:31.136 --> 29:36.096
Every fuckin' TV show now,
they rub your nose on it.

29:37.408 --> 29:39.706
Although, that--

29:39.744 --> 29:42.474
the lesbian thing
with the, uh...

29:42.514 --> 29:44.846
Jennifer Beals,

29:44.883 --> 29:47.044
it's not bad.

29:48.653 --> 29:50.746
She a dyke in real life?

29:51.790 --> 29:53.985
l don't give
too much of a shit

29:54.025 --> 29:55.788
what people do
behind closed doors

29:55.827 --> 29:58.921
with the consenting
adults.

29:58.963 --> 30:03.024
Although don't forget:
l'm a strict Catholic.

30:03.067 --> 30:06.195
l agree with that
Senator Sanitorium,

30:06.237 --> 30:08.762
who says if we let
this stuff go too far,

30:08.807 --> 30:11.139
pretty soon we'll
be fucking dogs.

30:11.176 --> 30:13.041
l hear a lot
of ambivalence.

30:16.581 --> 30:19.482
This guy that
got outed, look,

30:19.517 --> 30:21.917
the guys that work for me
are asking for head.

30:22.954 --> 30:25.889
His head.
What the fuck?

30:27.525 --> 30:30.824
You know, him and me,
we're in the construction business.

30:30.862 --> 30:34.093
Now some of these
union old-timers, the contractors,

30:34.132 --> 30:36.896
they're not gonna want
to be seen with him.

30:36.935 --> 30:40.132
And l'm talking huge deals,
major fucking dollars.

30:42.040 --> 30:46.170
A lot of your circle
must have done jail time.

30:46.211 --> 30:50.944
They can't be strangers
to male-male sexual contact.

30:54.385 --> 30:56.285
You get a pass for that.

30:57.755 --> 30:59.814
Well, that's nice.

31:01.292 --> 31:03.021
Well, what are
you gonna do?

31:03.061 --> 31:05.359
There's no women there.

31:05.396 --> 31:09.196
You're there
five, 10 years.

31:13.004 --> 31:16.701
Just for the record, my incarceration
was very short term,

31:16.741 --> 31:18.971
so l never had any need
for any anal-- you know.

31:21.179 --> 31:25.639
So this fellow who's been outed,
what's he saying?

31:25.683 --> 31:28.618
You think l'm lying,
don't you?

31:28.653 --> 31:31.213
About when
l was in jail.

31:31.256 --> 31:34.692
l've given you no indication
l think you're lying.

31:43.101 --> 31:47.936
What the fuck, l suppose
something inside me says

31:47.972 --> 31:51.169
God bless, a' salut'.

31:51.209 --> 31:53.609
Who gives a shit?

31:56.247 --> 31:59.648
l mean l had a second chance.
Why shouldn't he?

31:59.684 --> 32:02.152
Part of your new outlook?

32:02.186 --> 32:04.882
Maybe.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.051
l salute it, then.

32:09.327 --> 32:11.386
Tall fuckin' order,
l'll tell you that.

32:11.429 --> 32:13.056
How so?

32:13.097 --> 32:17.295
You can talk about every day being
a gift and stopping to smell the roses,

32:17.335 --> 32:21.499
but regular life's got a way
of picking away at it.

32:21.539 --> 32:24.406
Your house,
the shit you own,

32:24.442 --> 32:26.501
it drags you down.

32:26.544 --> 32:28.808
Your kids,
what they want.

32:28.846 --> 32:31.838
One bad idea
after another.

32:33.818 --> 32:37.413
Just trying to work a cell phone menu
is enough to make you scream.

32:41.125 --> 32:42.592
There's some cold pasta.

32:42.627 --> 32:45.562
No, l ate already.

32:45.596 --> 32:47.461
What's all that?

32:48.466 --> 32:51.401
For the silent auction.

32:51.436 --> 32:53.427
My busy little beaver.

32:53.471 --> 32:56.235
Not really.

32:59.077 --> 33:01.375
Look, Ton', l haven't
wanted to bug you,

33:01.412 --> 33:03.607
but before you'd
gotten hurt,

33:03.648 --> 33:05.843
you said you would get
that building inspector

33:05.883 --> 33:08.408
to cut me some slack
so l could get back to my business?

33:08.453 --> 33:11.616
Oh yeah, right right.
l will, later.

33:12.657 --> 33:15.353
Come here.

33:15.393 --> 33:20.160
No, uh, l'm still not
ready for that.

33:20.198 --> 33:24.259
Last time l thought l tore something
from tensing my muscles.

33:26.704 --> 33:28.672
No, l got something
for that scar.

33:31.576 --> 33:33.305
Oh.

33:45.723 --> 33:47.350
Vitamin E.

33:47.392 --> 33:50.452
My facialist said
it will help get the red out.

33:56.034 --> 33:58.867
You were right
about my uncle, Carm.

33:58.903 --> 34:02.430
All along.

34:02.473 --> 34:05.965
lt doesn't give me
any pleasure, believe me.

34:06.010 --> 34:09.844
l should have cut him
out of my life.

34:09.880 --> 34:13.078
l brought this
all on myself.

34:13.117 --> 34:17.417
You did not.
Don't ever think that.

34:20.058 --> 34:25.018
All this, you never once
said ''l told you so.''

34:28.166 --> 34:30.396
Accentuate the positive.

34:33.571 --> 34:36.301
l wanted you
to get better.

34:39.744 --> 34:43.440
You know my shrink...

34:43.481 --> 34:47.884
told me that, uh...

34:47.918 --> 34:52.288
l stood by Junior through
all his jealousy and shit...

34:55.193 --> 34:59.823
trying to prove
l'm a good guy...

35:02.633 --> 35:06.296
and that my mother couldn't
hate a good boy like that.

35:10.675 --> 35:13.109
lmagine laying
next to a guy 15 years

35:13.144 --> 35:15.669
and all the time he's been playing for
the pink team.

35:15.713 --> 35:18.341
Who told you?
Tony swore me to secrecy.

35:18.382 --> 35:19.815
l'm not gonna
burn my sources.

35:19.851 --> 35:21.819
Anyway, it's all over
the place.

35:21.853 --> 35:26.552
Those children... imagine when they
find out their father's a finook.

35:26.591 --> 35:29.219
God, she's such a bright girl,
Marie Spatafore.

35:29.260 --> 35:31.319
You think she and Vito
had some arrangement?

35:31.362 --> 35:33.262
l just hope she
gets herself tested.

35:35.933 --> 35:39.391
Still, Vito? He'd be like the last
one you'd suspect.

35:39.437 --> 35:42.372
Suspect of what?

35:42.406 --> 35:45.000
Wow, such a young lady!

35:45.042 --> 35:46.737
Yes, she's working
two jobs.

35:46.777 --> 35:50.543
Days she's interning at Gendler,
Lookstein, Abruzzo & Abruzzo.

35:50.581 --> 35:52.446
What about Vito?

35:52.483 --> 35:56.214
Nothing. Him and Marie
are having some problems, that's all.

35:57.955 --> 36:01.721
- l can probably guess.
- Excuse me?

36:01.759 --> 36:04.193
Huh-uh, l'm not
going first.

36:04.228 --> 36:06.093
Do you know
something?

36:11.702 --> 36:13.897
Okay...

36:13.938 --> 36:17.874
he is possibly...

36:17.909 --> 36:19.672
gay.

36:19.710 --> 36:21.735
Finn saw him giving
some guy a blowjob.

36:23.114 --> 36:24.513
What?

36:24.549 --> 36:26.210
When Dad got him that job
in construction?

36:26.250 --> 36:28.241
Finn showed up early
one morning and he saw Vito

36:28.286 --> 36:30.311
in a car going down on some
security guard.

36:30.354 --> 36:33.255
- Oh my God!
- He saw this?

36:33.291 --> 36:35.486
He had Finn all freaked out.
He still does.

36:35.526 --> 36:37.118
Why didn't you
say something?

36:37.161 --> 36:40.028
Because Vito
warned Finn not to.

36:44.435 --> 36:46.335
You gotta hear
what Meadow just told us.

36:46.370 --> 36:48.395
- Mom!
- The cat's out of the bag, Meadow.

36:53.010 --> 36:57.106
Oh, it's ''Dr. Yank 'em,''
the painless dentist.

36:57.148 --> 36:59.844
How you doing, kid?
Hey Ton'.

36:59.884 --> 37:02.318
Hey--

37:04.422 --> 37:06.754
Unfortunately, Finn here
has got some bad news,

37:06.791 --> 37:09.089
so, uh, listen up.

37:09.126 --> 37:10.855
Sit down.

37:11.896 --> 37:13.989
Go ahead.

37:14.031 --> 37:15.692
Tell 'em
what you saw.

37:22.006 --> 37:25.203
Don't be scared.
lt's all right.

37:44.495 --> 37:46.690
All right, if we can just
head over and have lunch.

37:46.731 --> 37:48.130
Good morning.

38:02.480 --> 38:04.710
Good morning.

38:31.809 --> 38:34.471
Let me ask you
a question.

38:34.512 --> 38:37.310
Before he cornered you
in the porta-potty,

38:37.348 --> 38:39.942
when the security guard
was sucking him off--

38:39.984 --> 38:42.418
Whoa one sec, it was
the other way around.

38:42.453 --> 38:44.751
What?

38:44.789 --> 38:49.055
Vito was blowing
the security guard.

38:49.093 --> 38:51.653
Son of a bitch!

38:51.696 --> 38:54.790
Catchin', not pitchin'?

38:58.469 --> 39:00.437
He's not gonna know
l told you?

39:00.471 --> 39:03.531
You ain't gonna have
no problem from Vito, believe me.

39:03.574 --> 39:06.941
- What are you gonna do?
- lt'll be okay.

39:06.977 --> 39:09.377
Get him to pay
for some therapy.

39:09.413 --> 39:13.144
Look, why don't you...
why don't you go out front,

39:13.184 --> 39:15.618
get yourself a sandwich,

39:15.653 --> 39:17.177
any kind you like, huh?

39:17.221 --> 39:19.712
Soda.

39:19.757 --> 39:23.158
When we're done here,
somebody will take you back.

39:25.162 --> 39:27.528
All right.

39:34.105 --> 39:37.074
l wanna kill
the fat faggot myself.

39:37.108 --> 39:38.575
Be a fuckin' honor.

39:38.609 --> 39:42.067
Cut off his pisciatil'
and feed it to him.

39:42.113 --> 39:43.842
There can be
no mistake now.

39:43.881 --> 39:45.508
l can't believe
l stuck up for him!

39:45.549 --> 39:47.574
l feel like l've been
stabbed in the heart.

39:47.618 --> 39:49.779
We can't have him here
in our social club no more.

39:49.820 --> 39:51.287
l mean, that much
l do know.

39:51.322 --> 39:53.017
Social club?

39:53.057 --> 39:54.490
He's gotta go!

39:54.525 --> 39:56.959
l wanna think about it.

39:56.994 --> 39:59.588
Yeah, l don't know.

39:59.630 --> 40:02.360
What the fuck?
What is there to think about?

40:02.400 --> 40:05.267
- Sit down.
- Fuck that! l'll say it again!

40:05.302 --> 40:07.031
What the fuck is there
to think about?

40:07.071 --> 40:10.336
You gonna take care
of his kids, huh, after he's gone?

40:12.510 --> 40:15.775
lt's true.
They didn't do nothing.

40:15.813 --> 40:17.906
Poor little guys.

40:19.583 --> 40:21.210
Now sit down.

40:27.258 --> 40:30.659
l'm sorry if l yelled, T.
lt's just...

40:30.694 --> 40:32.924
how much more
betrayal can l take?

40:35.699 --> 40:38.395
Vito, a fag.

40:38.436 --> 40:40.904
Big construction tycoon.

40:40.938 --> 40:45.034
Ton', when he was always talking
about ''greasing the union,''

40:45.075 --> 40:46.542
who knew that's
what he meant?

40:50.748 --> 40:53.444
All right, this stays
in these four walls.

40:54.852 --> 40:56.911
Am l understood?

41:01.459 --> 41:05.122
- Phil, oh my God.
- You poor kid.

41:05.162 --> 41:08.689
l know. l can't
believe it myself.

41:08.732 --> 41:12.133
l keep waiting
for him to call.

41:12.169 --> 41:14.933
How long am l supposed
to tell the kids he's away on business?

41:14.972 --> 41:17.566
That fuckin' shitbag.
l get my hands on him

41:17.608 --> 41:19.200
l'm gonna tear him
limb from limb.

41:19.243 --> 41:22.337
- Oh, Phil, don't say that.
- You're my cousin he married,

41:22.379 --> 41:25.143
making a mockery
of the whole sacrament.

41:26.484 --> 41:28.816
But what do we
really know?

41:28.853 --> 41:31.981
l mean, maybe there
were signs, but...

41:33.791 --> 41:37.090
Vito Spatafore
is a good man,

41:37.127 --> 41:38.788
and he's
a wonderful dad.

41:40.798 --> 41:44.757
Somebody sees something one time
and he's tossed aside like garbage?

41:47.438 --> 41:49.167
That's why
l'm here, honey.

41:49.206 --> 41:51.606
There's been confirmation
through the grapevine.

41:51.642 --> 41:55.339
Vito was seen
in a car with a man.

41:56.680 --> 41:58.671
l don't want to get
graphic beyond that,

41:58.716 --> 42:00.843
the idea of it
repulses me so much.

42:01.986 --> 42:03.817
What confirmation?
Who?

42:03.854 --> 42:05.879
The witness has
no reason to lie.

42:05.923 --> 42:07.891
No...

42:07.925 --> 42:11.827
We can't be in denial
no more, much as we love him.

42:15.132 --> 42:17.623
Where do you think
he might have gone, honey?

42:17.668 --> 42:21.365
So we can get him back here,
get him to do something about it.

42:30.214 --> 42:32.409
Excuse me, Angie here?

42:32.449 --> 42:34.144
ln the office.

42:34.184 --> 42:36.618
We can get you anything
you want, sweetheart,

42:36.654 --> 42:38.417
air bags,
chrome rims--

42:38.455 --> 42:41.253
- Oh, hi.
- Carm, hi.

42:41.292 --> 42:43.453
l'm sorry.
Am l interrupting something?

42:43.494 --> 42:47.828
l'm here for the free
bodywork certificates for the auction.

42:47.865 --> 42:50.629
- Oh, that's right.
- But if you're busy...

42:50.668 --> 42:53.603
This'll just take
another sec.

42:53.637 --> 42:55.901
Okay, sure.

43:05.916 --> 43:08.510
They were doing something
behind closed doors.

43:08.552 --> 43:10.782
Well you know Angie's
put money on the street.

43:10.821 --> 43:13.085
How do you know?

43:13.123 --> 43:15.819
- Angie told me.
- She didn't tell me.

43:15.859 --> 43:17.258
Probably 'cause of Tony.

43:17.294 --> 43:19.524
Aw, maybe he didn't want you
to know something like that.

43:19.563 --> 43:22.396
Me and my big mouth.

43:23.601 --> 43:26.195
She's got enough money
to do that, huh?

43:30.407 --> 43:34.173
Well, she's pretty successful with that
body shop, so...

43:35.713 --> 43:37.203
Our grandmothers did it.

43:37.247 --> 43:42.116
Those were harder times,
but...a' salut', right?

43:42.152 --> 43:46.213
She's one of us.
Now it's like she's one of them.

43:48.626 --> 43:51.561
- You wanted to see me, Ton'?
- Yeah.

43:51.595 --> 43:53.825
Hey, Carlo.

43:56.600 --> 43:58.192
- Good to see you.
- Sit down.

44:00.437 --> 44:03.770
Putting you in charge of
all construction business,

44:03.807 --> 44:05.638
replacing Vito.

44:05.676 --> 44:07.473
Holy shit!

44:07.511 --> 44:09.809
Guys respect you
across the board,

44:09.847 --> 44:12.213
you done real good
real with the ports...

44:13.384 --> 44:15.181
Thank you, Ton'.

44:16.820 --> 44:18.879
Jeez, l don't know
what to say.

44:18.922 --> 44:20.787
We'll have a drink.

44:21.792 --> 44:23.259
Congratulations.

44:23.293 --> 44:24.988
A' salut,
a' salut.

44:31.835 --> 44:34.770
Listen, Ton'...

44:34.805 --> 44:38.297
since you think enough of me
to give me this responsibility

44:38.342 --> 44:40.469
l might as well be
the one to say it.

44:40.511 --> 44:43.207
All right,
skip the preambles.

44:44.348 --> 44:46.248
The guys on Vito's crew,

44:46.283 --> 44:48.274
they say if he
was to come back,

44:48.318 --> 44:50.047
they refuse to take
orders from him.

44:50.087 --> 44:52.749
Oh, they do?

44:52.790 --> 44:56.021
Not only that,

44:56.060 --> 44:58.358
a couple of the other captains
won't talk to him,

44:58.395 --> 45:01.831
and l don't disagree.

45:01.865 --> 45:04.095
Paulie especially.

45:04.134 --> 45:06.534
Now that he's
accepted it, hey...

45:06.570 --> 45:08.970
he's the most out
for Vito's scalp.

45:09.006 --> 45:13.807
Yeah, you should hear him, Ton'. He's
goin' fuckin' mau-mau on the subject.

45:15.746 --> 45:18.510
lt's not their fucking decision
who they work with.

45:20.017 --> 45:21.484
Let me tell
you something--

45:21.518 --> 45:24.544
fuckin' Vito,
through sheer hard work,

45:24.588 --> 45:26.283
turned himself
into my best earner.

45:26.323 --> 45:29.850
l don't even know
if l'd have the new boat without him.

45:29.893 --> 45:32.225
He's a come-from-behind
kind of guy.

45:32.262 --> 45:34.355
That's true, but--

45:34.398 --> 45:37.458
So l'm gonna burn
that kind of dedication?

45:37.501 --> 45:39.526
lt's hard to believe l couldn't get
something more out of him,

45:39.570 --> 45:41.367
if he were to come back.

45:41.405 --> 45:44.636
Stocks, offshore shit,
l don't know.

45:44.675 --> 45:48.304
Well...

45:48.345 --> 45:50.472
these other guys feel
an effort should be made

45:50.514 --> 45:53.039
to find him and put him down
for the honor of the family.

45:53.083 --> 45:55.608
Oh, please, huh?

45:55.652 --> 45:58.086
You know, certain people,
they love the high drama,

45:58.122 --> 46:01.319
like fuckin' high school girls.
And others l could name,

46:01.358 --> 46:04.191
they just can't wait to
whack somebody, anybody.

46:04.228 --> 46:08.494
But some people feel it's against
our principles, Tony.

46:08.532 --> 46:10.523
A sin.

46:11.869 --> 46:16.431
Carlo, let's be honest
with ourselves here.

46:16.473 --> 46:18.304
We all know Vito's
not the first.

46:25.449 --> 46:27.713
Well...

46:27.751 --> 46:30.811
we're gonna do
great things.

46:30.854 --> 46:34.620
Aw, Jesus, thanks again, Anthony.
Thank you.

47:07.224 --> 47:09.385
What?

47:11.695 --> 47:13.754
lt's 2006.

47:13.797 --> 47:18.166
There's pillow biters
in the Special Forces.

47:18.202 --> 47:21.933
Let me just
ask you, Ton'--

47:21.972 --> 47:24.770
sake of argument.

47:24.808 --> 47:27.436
Let's say he shows up.

47:27.477 --> 47:31.243
You gonna kiss this guy
on both cheeks?

47:33.183 --> 47:35.413
Take Paulie, okay?

47:35.452 --> 47:37.784
You know perfectly well

47:37.821 --> 47:42.724
guys like him never kick up their full
percent to you.

47:42.759 --> 47:44.852
You look the other way,

47:44.895 --> 47:48.331
price of doing
business.

47:48.365 --> 47:53.234
But you cut Vito slack now
that he's ''out of the closet,''

47:53.270 --> 47:56.967
just the excuse people need
to go off the reservation

47:57.007 --> 48:00.204
and start withholding
serious money.

48:03.647 --> 48:06.207
Let me read
in peace, will you?

48:09.052 --> 48:10.986
Having fun
with all this paper?

48:11.021 --> 48:13.319
l can't believe
this is just one case.

48:13.357 --> 48:15.951
Rafaella Martino.
l'm the lead attorney on this mess.

48:15.993 --> 48:17.927
Oh.
Meadow Soprano.

48:17.961 --> 48:20.259
- l'm Michael Kardish. l work with Rae.
- Hi.

48:20.297 --> 48:22.162
Ms. Soprano came
highly recommended.

48:22.199 --> 48:25.635
Columbia Dean's List, volunteer
at the South Bronx Law Center...

48:25.669 --> 48:27.967
This is really
interesting too.

48:28.005 --> 48:31.099
Of course it's different than the kind
of thing we see at the law center.

48:31.141 --> 48:32.870
Clients there are so
trampled and abused--

48:32.910 --> 48:34.901
Welcome to
white-collar fraud.

48:34.945 --> 48:38.073
l need the e-mails from box 44
and 45, July and August.

48:38.115 --> 48:40.208
Pull them and leave them
with my assistant.

48:40.250 --> 48:42.241
Okay.

48:43.687 --> 48:46.212
Tony Soprano's kid.

48:56.833 --> 48:59.028
Tony.

48:59.069 --> 49:00.764
Building my
lats back up.

49:00.804 --> 49:04.740
Did you by any chance talk to
the building inspector about my house?

49:04.775 --> 49:07.107
Shit, l forgot.

49:20.390 --> 49:23.257
The sorting's tedious,
but some of the cases--

49:23.293 --> 49:24.988
this guy was
pretty clever, really.

49:25.028 --> 49:27.223
He set up all these
phony investment firms

49:27.264 --> 49:28.993
and then just siphoned
the money out:

49:29.032 --> 49:31.023
- $80 million.
- Whoa.

49:31.068 --> 49:33.093
Yeah, he's out on bail.

49:34.972 --> 49:36.667
Then you look at
my father's friend,

49:36.707 --> 49:38.174
federal marshals
dragging him

49:38.208 --> 49:39.835
out of his own
daughter's wedding.

49:39.876 --> 49:41.343
He hasn't even
been tried yet.

49:41.378 --> 49:43.938
You're innocent in this
country until proven guilty.

49:43.981 --> 49:46.415
Yeah, but Johnny Macaroni
was indicted for murder.

49:46.450 --> 49:49.317
They couldn't let him
stay 15 more minutes?

49:51.188 --> 49:53.622
You better put
your pants on.

49:56.593 --> 49:58.584
You know why
they did that?

49:58.628 --> 50:00.755
To humiliate him
in front of everyone.

50:00.797 --> 50:03.197
Metal detectors,
frisking,

50:03.233 --> 50:04.825
my father
with the shoes?

50:04.868 --> 50:06.665
lt was pure
harassment.

50:06.703 --> 50:09.001
Yeah, but the guy's lucky
they even let him out.

50:09.039 --> 50:13.237
Oh, so white-collar criminals
can destroy people's lives

50:13.276 --> 50:16.439
and steal their pensions
and it's no big deal to you.

50:16.480 --> 50:20.075
You know what?
Bad subject.

50:20.117 --> 50:21.675
Let's talk about
something else.

50:21.718 --> 50:23.515
No, let's talk about it

50:23.553 --> 50:25.544
so we can stop
with the ''macaroni'' cracks.

50:25.589 --> 50:28.752
Weird, since you're
part ltalian yourself.

50:28.792 --> 50:31.022
Please, my dad
is so deracinated.

50:31.061 --> 50:33.655
Yeah, the way he prefers it.
All those hysterical jokes

50:33.697 --> 50:35.665
about ltalian cheeses
and smelly feet.

50:36.700 --> 50:38.224
Why are you
picking a fight?

50:38.268 --> 50:42.295
l'm not, but you're slamming my family.
l don't know.

50:45.242 --> 50:47.210
This is good shit.

50:47.244 --> 50:49.235
lt's amazing.

50:52.849 --> 50:56.080
You weren't there for
the ''grand inquisition'' about Vito.

50:56.119 --> 50:59.111
l knew it.
l'm picking the fight.

50:59.156 --> 51:01.784
l was in the back
of a butcher shop

51:01.825 --> 51:03.850
with your Uncle Paulie,

51:03.894 --> 51:07.057
ratting out a guy
l don't really even know.

51:07.097 --> 51:10.430
l mean what do you think's
going to happen to Vito for being gay?

51:12.903 --> 51:16.498
And don't give me any of that ''poverty
of the Mezzogiorno'' bullshit.

51:16.540 --> 51:18.531
We're in fucking
Caldwell, New Jersey,

51:18.575 --> 51:21.373
and you're on your
high horse about justice?

51:21.411 --> 51:24.847
They are gonna
mete it out themselves.

51:27.551 --> 51:29.246
This is untenable.

52:28.879 --> 52:32.815
This is nice,
this pot.

52:32.849 --> 52:37.081
Yeah, that's a Baneda--
Arts and Crafts Movement.

52:37.120 --> 52:41.352
Yeah? l really don't know
much about this stuff.

52:41.391 --> 52:42.858
Well, you've got
a good eye.

52:42.893 --> 52:45.987
That's the most
expensive piece in the store.

52:46.029 --> 52:48.964
You're a natural.
