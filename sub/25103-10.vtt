Previously, on Queen Sugar.

00:02.870 --> 00:05.668
[Darla]
I cant take Blue away from
the only family hes ever known.

00:05.710 --> 00:08.998
-Were his family too.
-Im asking

00:09.050 --> 00:11.666
-for 70/30 split for custody.
-Youre out your mind.

00:11.720 --> 00:13.927
The New Yorker,
they want to publish

00:13.970 --> 00:15.710
the chapter on your dads
depression.

00:15.760 --> 00:18.502
Sam has run this familys legacy
into the ground.

00:18.560 --> 00:19.800
I need him out.

00:19.850 --> 00:21.226
You can help me do that.

00:21.270 --> 00:22.476
Please dont hate me.

00:22.520 --> 00:25.978
Remy and I, we kissed.

00:26.020 --> 00:28.068
[Malik]
Oh, no, no, we need to put
that out right now.

00:28.110 --> 00:29.816
-[gunshot]
-Go, go, go!

00:32.990 --> 00:35.697
[Nova]
My mama was my north star.

00:35.740 --> 00:38.868
Free. Fierce.

00:38.910 --> 00:41.367
A warrior.

00:41.410 --> 00:43.901
My mama was...

00:43.960 --> 00:46.281
the ground
beneath my feet.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.456
But the day
the sickness came,

00:49.500 --> 00:54.005
the trees shook
and the ground swayed.

00:54.050 --> 00:58.464
And at 19, I let out a cry
in this earthquake of sorrow.

01:02.930 --> 01:04.261
She was my everything.

01:11.900 --> 01:16.906
Grief and confusion wedged into
every corner of my universe.

01:16.950 --> 01:20.738
Where her bright light
once charted my way,

01:20.790 --> 01:23.577
everything went dark.

01:26.710 --> 01:28.496
But an hour from New Orleans

01:28.540 --> 01:30.531
on the other side
of Lake Pontchartrain,

01:30.590 --> 01:33.206
deep in the stalks
of the cane fields,

01:33.260 --> 01:38.505
my sweet daddys tears
quenched the earth.

01:38.550 --> 01:42.008
I never knew that
that the land,

01:42.060 --> 01:44.676
and my mamas grave
beneath it,

01:44.730 --> 01:46.800
were more than
he could bear.

01:49.360 --> 01:51.316
My daddy was the land.

01:53.650 --> 01:57.484
And we were generations
of earth.

01:59.320 --> 02:01.117
From the nooses
withered in the trees

02:01.160 --> 02:02.980
to the blood-drenched
ground.

02:05.500 --> 02:07.070
Daddy would spend a lifetime

02:07.120 --> 02:09.327
fertilizing the earth
to grow anew.

02:11.500 --> 02:13.582
He fought hard.

02:15.050 --> 02:17.462
Every farming grant denied.

02:17.510 --> 02:20.388
Every deed contested.

02:20.430 --> 02:22.671
Every plantation owner
come a-knockin,

02:22.720 --> 02:24.210
trying to take
what was ours.

02:26.390 --> 02:28.438
He always stood tall

02:28.480 --> 02:31.938
and strong in those
mud-caked boots.

02:34.480 --> 02:36.607
But the day
her sickness came,

02:36.650 --> 02:39.141
he slowly started
bleeding out.

02:41.070 --> 02:45.109
The stars, her star
that once lit his sky,

02:45.160 --> 02:46.866
went dark.

02:48.580 --> 02:51.287
So he walked the furrows
with a gun

02:51.330 --> 02:53.787
in the worn corduroy jacket

02:53.840 --> 02:56.297
he used to warmed me with
on chilly nights.

02:57.630 --> 02:59.370
He walked for hours

02:59.430 --> 03:01.637
in a forest of cane,

03:01.680 --> 03:05.218
and buried in a casket
of sorrow.

03:07.810 --> 03:11.189
Unable to see her star.

03:14.730 --> 03:17.278
Holding that gun,
fingers curled...

03:19.030 --> 03:21.316
among generations
that walked before,

03:21.360 --> 03:24.443
grieving, bleeding...

03:26.830 --> 03:29.572
I never knew the depth
of his pain.

03:32.710 --> 03:36.373
But as the whispers of our
ancestors lifted from the ground

03:36.420 --> 03:38.206
and carried him
in the breeze,

03:38.260 --> 03:42.924
his fingers uncurled
and he loosened his grip,

03:42.970 --> 03:47.384
guiding him to the break
in the field.

03:47.430 --> 03:51.389
And at the edge of the land
he found us.

03:53.270 --> 03:54.851
Waiting.

03:56.440 --> 03:59.227
Arms opened.

04:04.530 --> 04:05.815
Thank you.

04:05.870 --> 04:07.826
[applause]

04:21.010 --> 04:22.750
Dreams never die

04:22.800 --> 04:25.086
Take flight
As the world turns

04:25.140 --> 04:26.880
Dreams never die

04:26.930 --> 04:28.636
Take flight
As the world turns

04:28.680 --> 04:30.511
Keep the colors
In the lines

04:30.560 --> 04:31.720
Take flight

04:33.140 --> 04:34.186
Dreams never die

04:40.400 --> 04:43.233
Keep the colors
In the lines

04:45.450 --> 04:47.270
Keep the colors
In the lines, take flight

04:50.330 --> 04:51.991
[news reporter] Investigations
are still underway.

04:52.040 --> 04:53.610
As of yet there are
no suspects,

04:53.660 --> 04:55.366
and the owner
of the plantation says

04:55.420 --> 04:56.990
there have been
no direct threats.

04:57.040 --> 04:58.371
I cant believe this.

04:58.420 --> 04:59.830
So disrespectful.

04:59.880 --> 05:01.450
What do you mean?

05:01.510 --> 05:03.410
I mean, I get it.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.086
Ive seen lots of people
disrespecting over there, but...

05:06.140 --> 05:08.461
but thats still history,
you know?

05:08.510 --> 05:10.341
If they wanted
to make a statement,

05:10.390 --> 05:12.130
they should have just
burned down the big house.

05:14.770 --> 05:16.931
Oh, were still studying for
my physics test after school.

05:16.980 --> 05:18.686
Yes. Yes, we are.

05:18.730 --> 05:19.890
You keep ditching
our study sessions.

05:19.940 --> 05:21.100
I know, Im sorry.

05:22.940 --> 05:24.646
I see my girls.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.406
Okay.

05:26.450 --> 05:28.941
-Have a good day.
-You too.

05:28.990 --> 05:30.901
[school bell rings]

05:30.950 --> 05:32.747
Im not stupid.
I didnt tell them nothing.

05:32.790 --> 05:34.701
Gave them the exact alibi
everybody else gave.

05:34.750 --> 05:36.365
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

05:36.420 --> 05:38.126
Cops were at his house
last night.

05:38.170 --> 05:39.990
-Whose house?
-Ants.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.668
-Are you serious, bro?
-Yeah.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.917
But they dont got nothing.
Its just because of the game.

05:44.970 --> 05:46.676
People are talking.

05:46.720 --> 05:49.962
Its all over the news,
the Internet.

05:50.010 --> 05:51.591
Its going to be okay.

05:51.640 --> 05:53.767
You find it or not?
Its my pops.

05:53.810 --> 05:55.346
Oh, it was just probably
in someones bag.

05:55.390 --> 05:57.267
-We|| find it.
-Man, I hope so.

05:57.310 --> 05:58.686
Going to need it.

06:01.190 --> 06:03.818
I know Jarretts being
all thorough and everything.

06:03.860 --> 06:06.738
But, Lord,
some of these.

06:06.780 --> 06:11.365
Aint nobody going to put a pie
shop in the middle of nowhere.

06:11.410 --> 06:12.729
Look”.

06:15.410 --> 06:18.072
Baby, are you all right?

06:18.120 --> 06:21.203
I think I just slept
on my neck wrong last night.

06:21.250 --> 06:24.629
-Oh. I got me some aspirin.
-No, Im good. Im good.

06:24.670 --> 06:27.127
Im about to just take this out
to the truck and move on out.

06:30.220 --> 06:32.097
All right now.
Love you.

06:32.140 --> 06:33.630
I love you too.

06:47.900 --> 06:50.027
Whatever youve got,

06:50.070 --> 06:53.574
I can assure you
my wife already knows.

06:53.620 --> 06:56.657
Thats not why I asked you here,
Cokon.

06:58.870 --> 07:01.532
You might have my cousin
wrapped around your finger,

07:01.580 --> 07:04.993
but let me be clear:
theres a bIg difference

07:05.050 --> 07:07.166
between a Boudreaux
and a Landry.

07:09.380 --> 07:12.429
You got five minutes.
What do you want?

07:14.220 --> 07:16.677
Your shares in
Landry Enterprises.

07:16.720 --> 07:18.631
All 10%.

07:20.560 --> 07:21.800
Ill double
what youve paid her.

07:23.940 --> 07:25.510
Keep your mistress.

07:27.650 --> 07:31.154
No, Im here because of
a company called Pillary Reach.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.816
Now, youve been
rolling around in the mud

07:33.870 --> 07:35.826
with your frat brothers.

07:35.870 --> 07:37.940
Washing everyones
dirty money

07:38.000 --> 07:39.444
through your little
shell company.

07:40.910 --> 07:43.287
Its a "good ole boy" clich.

07:43.330 --> 07:46.163
But Daddy will not be happy
when he finds out.

07:48.340 --> 07:50.126
Ill give you half.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.831
Now, 5% is a lot.

07:51.880 --> 07:54.713
Money laundering
is a federal crime, Colton.

07:56.260 --> 07:57.670
And not only will you
go to prison,

07:57.720 --> 08:01.383
but the painstaking
FBI searches

08:01.440 --> 08:03.055
and all the investigations

08:03.100 --> 08:05.148
into your daddys
companies and finances,

08:05.190 --> 08:07.897
everything youve ever
been a part of...

08:09.440 --> 08:11.567
hell regret ever
giving you a dime.

08:15.700 --> 08:16.906
I want it all.

08:18.240 --> 08:20.242
All 10%.

08:20.290 --> 08:21.951
Im not here to barter.

08:27.840 --> 08:32.334
You can take your daddy down,
or I can take you down.

08:32.380 --> 08:34.041
Your choice.

08:43.100 --> 08:44.897
-[door opens and closes]
-[exhales]

08:46.060 --> 08:47.857
[knock on door]

08:47.900 --> 08:50.061
Finish your homework.

08:56.570 --> 08:58.071
[sighs]

09:00.450 --> 09:01.826
Are you Ralph Angel Bordelon?

09:03.790 --> 09:05.360
Whats this about?

09:05.420 --> 09:07.126
My name is Lorena Campos,

09:07.170 --> 09:10.048
This is Nina Williams
and Officer Charbonneau.

09:10.090 --> 09:12.251
Were from the Department
of Child and Family Services.

09:12.300 --> 09:14.165
Can we talk inside?

09:14.220 --> 09:16.711
Yall cant just be rolling up
on people like that.

09:16.760 --> 09:18.921
Sir, if we could please
just step inside.

09:18.970 --> 09:20.255
It wont take long.

09:22.720 --> 09:24.130
Come on.

09:40.030 --> 09:42.737
[Nina] And what did you have
for breakfast this morning?

09:42.790 --> 09:45.577
Eggs, toast and milk.

09:45.620 --> 09:47.076
[recorder beeps]

09:47.120 --> 09:48.951
We was in a rush
this morning.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.161
Kitchen usually
would be clean.

09:51.210 --> 09:53.792
I want to make sure
you finish reading through.

09:53.840 --> 09:55.580
-[Nina] Who made breakfast?
-[B|ue] Pop made it.

09:55.630 --> 09:57.837
Did Pop take you
to school too?

09:57.880 --> 10:00.178
Yes.

10:00.220 --> 10:03.178
Do you wake your pop up,
or does he wake you up?

10:03.220 --> 10:06.383
For school,
he wakes me up.

10:06.440 --> 10:09.147
On the weekend,
I wake him up.

10:09.190 --> 10:12.148
I see. Have you ever not
been able to wake your pop up?

10:13.780 --> 10:15.520
No.

10:15.570 --> 10:17.561
No. Okay.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.153
I just got to say,

10:23.200 --> 10:25.407
watching you
living this dream,

10:25.450 --> 10:27.077
standing up for yourself,

10:27.120 --> 10:30.419
all you Bordelons
are just so strong.

10:30.460 --> 10:32.951
I read that essay about
your brother this morning.

10:33.000 --> 10:35.457
That niece of yours
is a damn good writer.

10:35.510 --> 10:37.080
That she is,

10:37.130 --> 10:39.121
but what you mean
you read about Ernest?

10:39.180 --> 10:42.547
I printed it out after
my sister found it online,

10:42.600 --> 10:44.386
and she asked me
if these Bordelons

10:44.430 --> 10:46.512
was related
to Miss Violet.

10:46.560 --> 10:49.051
You know, and I was just glad
to read some good in the world

10:49.100 --> 10:50.476
instead of that awful fire.

10:50.520 --> 10:51.976
-You hear about that?
-I did.

10:54.940 --> 10:58.103
New Yorker.
Thats big, aint it?

10:58.150 --> 10:59.526
It sure is.

11:07.330 --> 11:09.150
Lets talk
about your record.

11:09.210 --> 11:12.748
My record got nothing to do
with my ability to be a dad.

11:12.790 --> 11:14.587
My interest is in your record
as it pertains

11:14.630 --> 11:16.245
to the welfare
of your child.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.757
Nothing wrong with
the welfare of my child.

11:18.800 --> 11:21.542
He fine.
Scraped his arm at school.

11:21.590 --> 11:24.423
And thats it.

11:24.470 --> 11:26.461
I need you to pay
attention here, please.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.670
Its kind of hard when she
in there interrogating my kid.

11:28.730 --> 11:30.595
This is standard
procedure.

11:30.640 --> 11:33.143
Who called you, huh?
I want to know.

11:33.190 --> 11:35.226
We cant disclose
that information.

11:35.270 --> 11:37.602
Look, Im a good dad, okay?

11:37.650 --> 11:41.108
I work my ass off
taking care of that boy.

11:41.150 --> 11:44.313
I provide for my son,
make sure he eat.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.656
Always safe, happy.

11:48.700 --> 11:51.749
I aint do nothing wrong,
all right?

11:51.790 --> 11:53.781
I aint do nothing wrong,
you understand?

11:53.830 --> 11:55.741
And, yeah, I want to know,

11:55.790 --> 11:58.293
who the hell said
I aint a good dad, huh?

11:58.340 --> 12:00.046
Why dont you sit down.

12:00.090 --> 12:02.923
Let us do our jobs
and well be on our way.

12:19.320 --> 12:20.685
Prosper?

12:20.740 --> 12:22.196
[Prosper]
Im in here.

12:23.490 --> 12:24.696
[Prosper breathing heavily]

12:26.530 --> 12:28.441
Here. Take my hand.

12:29.740 --> 12:31.458
Are you okay?

12:31.500 --> 12:34.116
-I just need a little help.
-Okay. Okay.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.240
Here, lets...
lets get you up.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.626
Lets get you sitting.

12:39.670 --> 12:41.661
Okay.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.085
Gently.

12:43.130 --> 12:44.620
[panﬁng]

12:46.510 --> 12:49.058
Didnt mean for you
to leave work.

12:51.060 --> 12:52.675
Thats fine.

12:52.730 --> 12:54.300
[sighs]

12:56.350 --> 12:58.011
What happened?

12:58.060 --> 13:01.109
I was just getting ready
to take a shower,

13:01.150 --> 13:02.890
and something slipped.

13:08.530 --> 13:11.363
Youre lucky you had
your phone on you.

13:12.580 --> 13:14.150
You think you can stand?

13:14.210 --> 13:17.498
Okay. Okay.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.797
Okay. Okay, no.

13:21.840 --> 13:24.661
Lets sit down.
Lets sit down.

13:26.890 --> 13:28.039
Okay.

13:32.430 --> 13:34.341
I think we got
to get you checked out.

13:37.940 --> 13:40.010
Just sit here for me, okay?

13:41.230 --> 13:42.470
Okay.

[dialing]

13:49.410 --> 13:50.980
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

13:51.030 --> 13:52.736
So you have to just
put your name there,

13:52.790 --> 13:54.906
and the company,
and the date and floor.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.076
[cell phone vibrates]

14:00.750 --> 14:02.661
-Thank you.
-Have a good day.

14:02.710 --> 14:04.291
Hello?

14:04.340 --> 14:06.251
So you think Im an unfit daddy,
huh?

14:06.300 --> 14:07.756
What are you
talking about?

14:07.800 --> 14:09.085
You tell me.

14:09.140 --> 14:10.755
I just had a cop

14:10.800 --> 14:12.631
and two ladies
from Child Services up here.

14:12.680 --> 14:14.671
They say somebody
filed a complaint.

14:14.720 --> 14:17.132
-What? _
-Wanna tell me whats gomg on?

14:17.190 --> 14:18.646
I thought we was
going to work it out.

14:18.690 --> 14:20.260
All that talk
about mediation.

14:20.310 --> 14:22.016
And this is what
youre going to do?

14:22.070 --> 14:24.982
I dont know anything
about this, I swear.

14:25.030 --> 14:28.443
I would never make
a phone call like that.

14:28.490 --> 14:31.152
Yeah, well, someone did.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.690
Who you been
talking to, huh?

14:32.740 --> 14:34.992
No, I havent talked
to anybody.

14:36.120 --> 14:37.360
I got to go.

14:37.410 --> 14:39.662
[phone line disconnects]

14:41.750 --> 14:43.957
[phone line rings]

14:45.800 --> 14:47.256
You lie.

14:47.300 --> 14:49.427
[school bell ringing]

14:49.470 --> 14:51.335
[Ant]
Simons dont know a damn thing
about creative writing.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.926
_ [KJ]
All he said was not to swear.

14:52.970 --> 14:54.961
[Ant]
Freedom of expression, okay?

14:55.020 --> 14:57.557
Not gonna censor my thoughts.
What is this, 1984?

14:57.600 --> 15:00.182
-Its school._
-Just rewrite it.

15:00.230 --> 15:02.687
I got eyes on him.
Hes in the east hallway.

15:08.860 --> 15:10.816
-You Anthony Coleman?
-Yeah.

15:12.280 --> 15:13.986
[Micah]
Yo, man, get off...

15:14.030 --> 15:15.486
He has a right to know
what this about.

15:15.540 --> 15:18.077
Back up, young lady.

15:18.120 --> 15:20.668
Anthony Coleman, youre under
arrest for arson, trespassing

15:20.710 --> 15:22.371
and destruction of property.

15:22.420 --> 15:24.536
Man, these hurt.
KJ, call my mom.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.739
Im calling her now, man.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.791
[Anderson] You got a right
to remain silent.

15:29.840 --> 15:32.547
Anything you say can and will
be used against you...

15:32.590 --> 15:33.966
[school bell rings]

15:41.650 --> 15:43.390
All right.

15:43.440 --> 15:45.010
So, I understand youre here
to see Kevin Jarvis?

15:45.070 --> 15:46.890
-Yes, maam.
-Hes out.

15:46.940 --> 15:48.817
My names Taj Clemens.

15:48.860 --> 15:50.942
What can I do for you,
Mr....?

15:50.990 --> 15:52.696
Bordelon.

15:55.240 --> 15:59.199
I had a visit today
from DCFS.

16:01.160 --> 16:03.116
Said they was going to call
Mr. Jarvis about me.

16:03.170 --> 16:04.819
And hes going to be honest
when he discusses your case--

16:04.880 --> 16:06.279
Im not worried about him
being honest.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.706
Great. Whats the problem, then?

16:10.380 --> 16:11.756
[sighs]

16:13.340 --> 16:15.968
See, I was going
to ask him...

16:16.010 --> 16:19.673
you know, my record
affect DCFS.

16:19.720 --> 16:22.268
When they make decisions about
my early parole next month.

16:22.310 --> 16:26.679
All this going to affect
the parole boards decision?

16:26.730 --> 16:28.971
Depends if the investigations
substantiated.

16:29.030 --> 16:30.600
Youll just have
to wait and see.

16:30.650 --> 16:31.890
That all?

16:33.820 --> 16:35.060
Thats all.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.519
Thank you.

16:42.620 --> 16:43.826
[sighs]

16:48.000 --> 16:49.240
Ralph Angel?

16:51.720 --> 16:53.540
-What up, Toine?
-Hey, man.

16:53.590 --> 16:55.888
-Good to see you.
-Yeah, good to see you, man.

16:55.930 --> 16:58.558
Hey, Billie,
your dads going to be fine,

16:58.600 --> 17:01.421
but Dr. Bergers concerned
about his x-rays.

17:01.470 --> 17:03.347
Likely theyll have
to push back his surgery.

17:03.390 --> 17:07.224
I just--I wanted to talk it
through with you.

17:07.270 --> 17:09.727
Okay, just give me a call
when you get this.

17:09.770 --> 17:11.101
Thanks.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.480
Hey.

17:13.530 --> 17:16.158
Thank you.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.441
The doctor said they have
to keep him overnight?

17:18.490 --> 17:20.788
Its standard
procedure.

17:20.830 --> 17:22.445
They want to be careful,
keep an eye on him.

17:22.500 --> 17:23.649
He took a pretty hard spill.

17:25.830 --> 17:27.991
You know he canceled
his surgery?

17:29.710 --> 17:30.870
I did not know that.

17:34.050 --> 17:37.463
Im learning proud men
dont like getting sick.

17:37.510 --> 17:39.000
Think theyre invincible.

17:40.970 --> 17:43.097
I dont know if its pride
more than it is fear.

17:59.910 --> 18:01.787
I want to go home.

18:06.960 --> 18:09.622
Well, the doctor said you need
to stay overnight

18:09.670 --> 18:12.992
for observation, so...

18:13.050 --> 18:15.962
Im going to stay with you,
if thats okay?

18:16.010 --> 18:17.625
Thats not necessary,
Charley.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.329
Well, I insist.

18:22.930 --> 18:24.511
Prosper...

18:26.560 --> 18:29.802
did you cancel your surgery?

18:29.850 --> 18:31.511
I appreciate what
youre doing,

18:31.560 --> 18:34.688
taking me in
and looking after me, but...

18:45.450 --> 18:48.248
You dont have
to do this alone.

18:51.080 --> 18:52.661
Mr. Prosper?

18:56.590 --> 18:58.581
You know Anita LeMelle,

18:58.630 --> 19:00.757
shes the secretary
up at the church?

19:02.720 --> 19:06.099
No, I dont.

19:06.140 --> 19:10.019
Her husband went in
for hip surgery last year.

19:10.060 --> 19:11.800
He died on the table.

19:14.270 --> 19:19.446
Folks my age, they go in
and they dont come out.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.440
[knock on door]

19:34.210 --> 19:37.122
Hi, Vi. Come in.
Please, come in.

19:42.340 --> 19:44.251
I can guess why
youre here, Vi,

19:44.300 --> 19:46.552
but I just want to start
by saying this is all for Blue.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.841
You got to do
better than that,

19:48.890 --> 19:50.881
because if this all for Blue,

19:50.940 --> 19:53.761
you would have come long ago
with more than a checkbook.

19:53.810 --> 19:56.517
But oh, no, you left
the raising to us.

19:56.570 --> 19:58.561
-That is not--
-Treating us like

19:58.610 --> 20:01.738
some glorified babysitters
while your daughter was off

20:01.780 --> 20:04.567
snorting, smoking and doing
whatever and whoever

20:04.620 --> 20:07.111
-she could get her hands on.
-Dont--

20:07.160 --> 20:10.323
Lady, you about to feel
the Bordelon wrath.

20:10.370 --> 20:13.282
I am grateful
for everything

20:13.330 --> 20:15.412
that you and your brother did
to raise Blue.

20:15.460 --> 20:17.746
And I had no problem
when it was you and Ernest.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.506
But ever since
Ralph Angels taken over,

20:19.550 --> 20:21.415
there have been things,
questionable manners,

20:21.470 --> 20:23.085
in which he raises
that child.

20:23.130 --> 20:26.008
How you know how he cares
for that child?

20:26.050 --> 20:30.510
You and the babys mama
have been resting in DC.

20:30.560 --> 20:33.347
while hes down here
busting his ass every day

20:33.390 --> 20:35.267
to put clothes
on that boys back.

20:35.310 --> 20:38.609
Every dime he makes
goes to that child.

20:38.650 --> 20:43.349
Every ounce of love he has
goes to that little boy.

20:43.400 --> 20:45.448
But Blue is bouncing
from home to home.

20:45.490 --> 20:48.402
while Ralph Angels working
long hours and multiple jobs.

20:48.450 --> 20:50.281
Its an unstable environment.

20:50.330 --> 20:53.868
Not to mention hes got
criminals employed on his farm.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.457
He lets men in the house
with alcohol,

20:56.500 --> 20:58.161
and their friends,
and god knows what else.

20:58.210 --> 21:00.542
Excuse me,
you need stop right there.

21:00.590 --> 21:02.626
No wonder hes wetting the bed
and acting out in school.

21:02.670 --> 21:05.798
Its a cry for help.
So, no, I wont stand by, Vi,

21:05.840 --> 21:09.424
and watch this happen
to our grandson

21:09.470 --> 21:12.382
when we can provide
the best care,

21:12.430 --> 21:15.263
money and stability
that that child needs.

21:15.310 --> 21:17.767
Like your daughter had?

21:20.230 --> 21:23.063
See, maybe if the mama
aint here one minute

21:23.110 --> 21:24.896
and gone the next,

21:24.950 --> 21:26.690
Blue wouldnt be having
these problems.

21:26.740 --> 21:28.480
Did you ever
think about that?

21:31.830 --> 21:33.866
Please, Vi.

21:33.910 --> 21:36.117
Im not trying
to disrespect you.

21:37.670 --> 21:39.626
But put yourself in our shoes.

21:39.670 --> 21:41.706
What would you do?

21:41.750 --> 21:45.538
Ralph Angel may not even
be Blues biological father.

21:53.770 --> 21:54.919
Hm!

22:03.860 --> 22:08.695
Ralph Angel is more
of a parent to that child

22:08.740 --> 22:10.981
than his mama ever even
attempted to be.

22:12.740 --> 22:15.459
I dont give a rats ass
about no DNA.

22:17.040 --> 22:18.280
Hes a Bordelon.

22:20.250 --> 22:22.332
And I will gladly be damned

22:22.380 --> 22:26.123
if you, Child Services,
or your damn daughter

22:26.170 --> 22:28.218
try to tell me
anything different.

22:30.260 --> 22:32.421
I will bring you a fight.

22:43.110 --> 22:44.646
[sighs]

22:48.740 --> 22:50.150
Theyre trying to take him
away from me.

22:50.200 --> 22:54.193
DCFS is not going to take
a child away from a loving home.

22:54.240 --> 22:55.992
They want whats best
for him.

22:56.040 --> 22:57.576
Your_e_ on the_ birth
certificate, right?

22:57.620 --> 22:59.201
Yeah, Im on the birth
certificate.

22:59.250 --> 23:00.490
So, yeah,
youll be fine.

23:00.540 --> 23:02.371
Man...

23:02.420 --> 23:04.411
cards aint always stacked
in my favor, Toine.

23:04.460 --> 23:06.257
Like everybody
against me.

23:06.300 --> 23:08.165
Rah, man, you know
it aint like that.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.370
You aint seen
what I been through.

23:10.430 --> 23:12.216
You wanted my advice
for whats happening

23:12.260 --> 23:13.887
with this Child Services woman,
right?

23:16.060 --> 23:17.971
Look, man, you saw how it was
back in the day.

23:18.020 --> 23:20.727
Any day I wasnt in a fight,
I was starting one.

23:20.770 --> 23:24.069
I felt like I had the weight
of the world on my shoulders.

23:24.110 --> 23:25.930
And remember
what my dad was like?

23:25.980 --> 23:28.028
-I remember.
-All that trouble I got into

23:28.070 --> 23:30.061
was because people
didnt understand me.

23:30.110 --> 23:32.522
Nothing was ever my fault.
It was always everybody else.

23:32.570 --> 23:36.609
But it wasnt until I took
responSIbility for myself,

23:36.660 --> 23:38.696
until I understood
who I was...

23:38.750 --> 23:40.615
So you aint ever
get mad no more?

23:41.870 --> 23:43.497
Just mad at everybody.

23:43.540 --> 23:47.795
I have a rage in me
that knows no bounds.

23:47.840 --> 23:50.582
But now I know that society
look at me a certain way.

23:50.630 --> 23:53.133
So I cant let that dictate
how I react.

23:54.930 --> 23:57.842
Hey, take it from me, man.

23:57.890 --> 23:59.767
Not everybodys father
would dig through the trash

23:59.810 --> 24:01.095
for their kids toy.

24:02.730 --> 24:05.051
Youre a good dad,
Ralph Angel.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.680
But all that man shit...

24:06.730 --> 24:08.277
Man, what man...?

24:08.320 --> 24:10.356
This man shit right here.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.231
All thats going to do is take
you closer to losing him.

24:14.950 --> 24:16.770
[sighs]

24:19.500 --> 24:21.900
[Darlene]
Darla, this is Lorena Campos

24:21.960 --> 24:24.076
from the Department
of Family and Child Services.

24:24.130 --> 24:25.449
-Shes here to--
-Its good to meet you.

24:25.500 --> 24:27.161
I know why youre here.

24:27.210 --> 24:29.166
Miss Sutton, I just have
a few questions

24:29.210 --> 24:31.917
about your son Blue and his
father, Ralph Angel Bordelon.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.710
-Okay.
-Like I was saying,

24:33.760 --> 24:36.297
Blue is so happy
when hes here with Darla.

24:36.350 --> 24:38.636
Sweetie, I hope you dont mind,
I showed her Blues room.

24:43.900 --> 24:45.640
Im sorry...

24:45.690 --> 24:48.067
are you here to question
both of us,

24:48.110 --> 24:49.429
or just me?

24:49.480 --> 24:50.981
Im here to talk to you.

24:54.660 --> 24:58.778
Then, Mom, if you wouldnt mind
giving us the room.

25:00.120 --> 25:01.326
Oh.

25:01.370 --> 25:03.247
Yes, of course.

25:03.290 --> 25:04.951
Ill just go pop down
and get some groceries.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.877
If youll excuse me.

25:14.630 --> 25:15.881
Ill be back.

25:35.280 --> 25:37.157
[knock on door]

25:42.290 --> 25:44.155
[door closes]

25:44.210 --> 25:45.359
Thanks.

26:07.480 --> 26:09.016
You dont have to stay.

26:10.270 --> 26:11.430
I dont mind.

26:26.040 --> 26:30.659
You didnt think to tell me
about this essay of yours?

26:30.710 --> 26:33.372
It was a last-minute
replacement.

26:33.420 --> 26:35.581
Another author
dropped out.

26:35.630 --> 26:37.427
I brought a copy
I printed out for you.

26:37.470 --> 26:39.381
You can keep it.
Ive seen it.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.466
I spent all day
fighting with folks

26:43.510 --> 26:47.059
outside this family
by disrespecting who we are.

26:47.100 --> 26:52.857
And here you are doing the same
thing from inside the family.

26:52.900 --> 26:55.937
I cant wrap
my brain around

26:55.990 --> 26:59.608
why you running around telling
your daddys dirty laundry?

26:59.660 --> 27:01.366
Its not like that.

27:01.410 --> 27:03.366
Youre the one told me
to speak my truth.

27:03.410 --> 27:05.617
Yes. Your truth.

27:05.660 --> 27:07.708
My brother, your daddy,

27:07.750 --> 27:09.991
aint even here
to defend himself.

27:11.920 --> 27:14.127
Im sorry I didnt tell you.

27:15.420 --> 27:16.626
I shouldve.

27:18.590 --> 27:20.626
But people have been
reaching out to me all day.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.079
On Twitter.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.846
Emails from colleagues.

27:23.890 --> 27:26.848
Everyone saying how much
Daddys story resonated.

27:26.890 --> 27:28.517
Helped them
have a conversation.

27:28.560 --> 27:30.596
This is helping people.

27:30.640 --> 27:32.392
It means something.

27:32.440 --> 27:34.431
And what about us?

27:34.480 --> 27:36.812
Youre so busy
running around

27:36.860 --> 27:38.987
helping everybody else,
you forgot about us?

27:39.030 --> 27:40.816
No. When I found out
what Daddy went through,

27:40.860 --> 27:43.237
what all he was struggling with,
I was angry.

27:45.280 --> 27:48.192
Mad as hell at all the people
who ever wronged him.

27:49.830 --> 27:52.492
But really, Aunt Vi,
I was mad at myself.

27:54.380 --> 27:56.541
I was here.

27:58.340 --> 28:00.296
I was right here.

28:00.340 --> 28:02.797
And I had no idea.

28:02.840 --> 28:04.387
I didnt know.

28:07.060 --> 28:08.379
None of us did.

28:12.060 --> 28:13.550
Nova, I love you.

28:14.940 --> 28:17.101
Always have.
Always will.

28:17.150 --> 28:18.390
But youre off.

28:20.280 --> 28:22.145
You think this
a good decision,

28:22.200 --> 28:24.065
something aint right
with you.

28:24.120 --> 28:25.940
In your life, in your soul.

28:25.990 --> 28:29.619
I dont know what it is,
but whatever it is, fix it.

28:31.500 --> 28:33.570
Come to yourself.

28:47.810 --> 28:51.177
[Keke] I know he got
into some stupid stuff,

28:51.230 --> 28:53.630
but I never thought hed pull
a stunt like this.

28:55.810 --> 28:58.222
Maybe it wasnt his fault.

28:58.270 --> 29:00.147
Maybe it was an accident.

29:00.190 --> 29:02.988
Like, they havent, you know,
proven anything yet.

29:07.490 --> 29:08.696
Micah...

29:17.040 --> 29:18.337
do you know something?

29:24.380 --> 29:25.540
Yeah.

29:30.680 --> 29:31.965
Yeah, we....

29:34.390 --> 29:36.301
we were all there.

29:37.810 --> 29:39.516
Wed been talking
about it

29:39.570 --> 29:41.777
for a couple of weeks, but--

29:41.820 --> 29:45.028
Wait. Yall have been
planning this for weeks?

29:45.070 --> 29:46.901
Is this why you havent
been hanging out?

29:46.950 --> 29:48.986
Every time I hit you up
to hang out with us,

29:49.030 --> 29:50.770
youre always talking about
how busy you are.

29:50.830 --> 29:54.038
Yeah, I have been.
I have SATs coming up.

29:54.080 --> 29:56.822
And ya|| could go to jail
if you get caught.

29:56.870 --> 29:58.952
Like, I cant believe
you did something like this.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.831
Arent you the same person
that told me

30:00.880 --> 30:02.620
I should make some noise when I
wanted to do something

30:02.670 --> 30:04.126
about that confederate sword at
Gardini?

30:04.170 --> 30:06.673
-Thats not_this.
-Yes, it is.

30:08.590 --> 30:10.171
What are you even doing?

30:10.220 --> 30:12.051
Excuse me?

30:12.100 --> 30:14.477
Theyre actually out there
doing something.

30:14.520 --> 30:16.841
Youre just standing around
talking about it.

30:16.890 --> 30:19.358
Standing around?
I have been working my ass off

30:19.400 --> 30:21.140
trying to qualify
for scholarships

30:21.190 --> 30:23.818
to get into college.

30:23.860 --> 30:25.487
Stop acting like youre woke,

30:25.530 --> 30:27.066
because you burned
our ancestors homes

30:27.110 --> 30:28.600
and you got
your friend arrested.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.946
I didnt get
my friend arrested.

30:30.990 --> 30:33.038
Ive been here.

30:33.080 --> 30:35.150
I know the difference between
whats real and whats not.

30:35.200 --> 30:36.610
And this?

30:36.660 --> 30:38.161
What did it do?

30:46.510 --> 30:48.046
What are you doing?

30:48.090 --> 30:49.387
-I cant--
-Where are you going?

30:49.430 --> 30:50.920
Stop, stop, stop.

30:50.970 --> 30:52.597
This doesnt seem like you
at all.

30:54.060 --> 30:55.209
Yeah, well, who am I?

30:58.100 --> 31:00.398
I dont know.

31:16.580 --> 31:17.956
Pop?

31:19.710 --> 31:21.530
Why did the police come?

31:23.960 --> 31:26.872
Just a misunderstanding.

31:26.920 --> 31:29.002
Them ladies wanted to make sure
the house was good.

31:29.050 --> 31:31.837
Thats all.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.505
Im sorry if they scared you.

31:36.810 --> 31:38.801
I was a little scared
myself.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.225
Is that why you yelled?

31:46.690 --> 31:48.066
Yeah.

31:49.610 --> 31:51.066
And I shouldnt have.

31:55.280 --> 31:56.781
Whats a record?

32:00.410 --> 32:02.458
When I tell you
not to do something...

32:08.590 --> 32:10.717
and you do it anyway,

32:10.760 --> 32:13.752
then they got to put you
on time-out.

32:13.800 --> 32:15.381
When you was a baby...

32:18.520 --> 32:22.183
I did something
I shouldnt have.

32:23.940 --> 32:25.646
Had to go away
for a little while.

32:27.480 --> 32:29.141
Think about what I done.

32:36.030 --> 32:38.908
I was in prison, Blue.

32:43.540 --> 32:44.746
You know what prison is?

32:44.790 --> 32:46.451
Its where bad people go.

32:50.630 --> 32:52.507
Are you a bad person, Pop?

32:52.550 --> 32:56.213
No, Im not a bad person.

32:57.640 --> 32:59.005
But I did
some bad things.

33:01.180 --> 33:04.343
I took things
that werent mine.

33:09.360 --> 33:11.351
I need you
to know something.

33:11.400 --> 33:13.448
I regret the things I done.

33:15.410 --> 33:17.731
I aint ever going
to do them again.

33:17.780 --> 33:19.691
You understand?

33:22.080 --> 33:24.492
I aint going to let nothing...

33:24.540 --> 33:27.623
aint going to let nothing
take me away from you.

33:27.670 --> 33:28.830
Never again.

33:33.550 --> 33:34.710
Come here.

33:37.680 --> 33:38.999
Oh, man.

33:40.810 --> 33:42.380
I love you so much, man.

33:50.690 --> 33:52.100
[door closes]

33:56.530 --> 33:58.486
You going to come in here
and say hello?

34:00.200 --> 34:02.077
I think Im going
to lay it on down.

34:02.120 --> 34:03.530
Its been one of them days,
you know?

34:03.580 --> 34:05.957
Lord, dont I know it.

34:08.040 --> 34:11.953
Darlene is in town meddling
in Ralph Angels business,

34:12.000 --> 34:15.333
stirring up a whole heap
of trouble.

34:16.720 --> 34:19.291
And then Nova comes around here,

34:19.340 --> 34:23.128
telling me about this essay
she wrote for Ernest.

34:23.180 --> 34:25.808
Hollywood,
when you read it--

34:25.850 --> 34:27.010
I read it.

34:28.600 --> 34:30.648
Friend of mine
sent it to me.

34:32.570 --> 34:35.141
I dont understand
what got into that girl.

34:35.190 --> 34:38.444
Making Ernest look weak,
I tell you.

34:45.410 --> 34:46.650
What?

34:46.710 --> 34:48.530
You disagree?

34:50.040 --> 34:52.702
I dont disagree.
I just...

34:52.750 --> 34:54.957
I think we see things
a different way.

34:59.640 --> 35:00.880
You dont know, but...

35:02.890 --> 35:05.632
a few days ago
was the anniversary

35:05.680 --> 35:09.138
of Leanne having
that miscarriage.

35:13.690 --> 35:15.351
I know we aint never
talk about it.

35:15.400 --> 35:17.277
I dont ever want
to talk about it.

35:22.370 --> 35:24.326
She was 18 weeks.

35:28.960 --> 35:32.452
And since it_was
a late miscarriage...

35:34.170 --> 35:35.626
I saw her, Vi.

35:38.760 --> 35:41.126
The tiniest thing
I ever seen.

35:44.050 --> 35:46.883
And it was wrapped up
in a blanket.

35:46.930 --> 35:48.420
Put her in a basket.

35:51.190 --> 35:53.101
Just wheeled her away.

35:57.730 --> 35:59.311
That was 11 years ago.

36:03.320 --> 36:06.153
Shed be 11 years old.

36:10.410 --> 36:13.038
You know, some years,
when the day comes around,

36:13.080 --> 36:17.289
Ijust do all I can
to keep myself distracted.

36:19.590 --> 36:21.751
I dont know,
this year...

36:24.010 --> 36:26.046
have a lot going on,
you know?

36:31.440 --> 36:35.604
So when I read that thing
about Ernest...

36:36.940 --> 36:39.352
I know how hard it is

36:39.400 --> 36:41.061
to stare at the pain.

36:44.570 --> 36:49.109
But its even harder
to act like it aint there.

37:02.840 --> 37:05.138
Your daddyd be so proud.

37:20.230 --> 37:21.390
You okay?

37:26.160 --> 37:27.400
No.

37:27.450 --> 37:29.270
No.

37:29.330 --> 37:31.195
Im not okay.

37:36.880 --> 37:38.279
[clears throat]

37:45.840 --> 37:47.717
Aunt Vi challenged me today.

37:47.760 --> 37:49.546
Told me to come to myself.

37:52.220 --> 37:53.926
Ever heard that?

37:55.020 --> 37:56.681
Its a parable.

37:58.400 --> 38:00.311
How do you know it?

38:07.740 --> 38:09.367
Shauna got hurt once.

38:12.410 --> 38:13.695
This was...

38:15.210 --> 38:16.746
years before she died.

38:20.290 --> 38:22.793
She was laid up
in a military hospital overseas

38:22.840 --> 38:24.410
for two weeks.

38:28.220 --> 38:30.381
After that,
she made me promise

38:30.430 --> 38:35.515
that if anything
ever happened to her,

38:35.560 --> 38:37.721
that I wouldnt spend
the rest of my life...

38:42.610 --> 38:44.271
in grief.

38:47.950 --> 38:49.656
That I would eventually...

38:53.830 --> 38:55.320
"come to myself."

38:59.250 --> 39:00.956
And move on.

39:03.090 --> 39:04.660
Hmm.

39:09.800 --> 39:12.257
I was supposed to set up
this new life.

39:16.560 --> 39:17.970
Sell my house.

39:24.610 --> 39:26.100
I never did.

39:28.570 --> 39:30.197
I couldnt leave it.

39:34.990 --> 39:37.197
Maybe its a pattern.

39:39.870 --> 39:42.703
In some way Im a way for you
to stay close to Charley.

39:44.290 --> 39:45.541
No.

39:46.760 --> 39:47.909
Its not that.

39:50.220 --> 39:53.007
What I feel for you is real.

39:57.100 --> 39:59.671
But its not worth the price it
would take from those we love.

40:01.770 --> 40:04.898
You can feel that,
cant you?

40:06.980 --> 40:10.108
I feel that were right
for each other.

40:10.150 --> 40:14.405
But I also feel the way that
we came to know that is...

40:14.450 --> 40:15.860
Filled with pain.

40:17.490 --> 40:19.287
Yeah.

40:19.330 --> 40:21.537
Always will be.

40:21.580 --> 40:23.741
Yeah.

40:31.260 --> 40:33.046
[sighs]

40:33.090 --> 40:36.469
Youre a good man
who deserves good things.

40:38.640 --> 40:40.267
So do you.

40:40.310 --> 40:45.930
You move like a bird

40:45.980 --> 40:49.313
With a wounded wing

40:49.360 --> 40:52.147
And wounded nerves

40:53.740 --> 40:58.905
I sail like a summer lost

41:00.330 --> 41:03.208
To a cold front

41:03.250 --> 41:05.320
Freezing fog

41:07.460 --> 41:12.659
You move like a bird

41:14.180 --> 41:16.967
With a wounded wing

41:17.010 --> 41:20.468
And wounded nerves

41:20.520 --> 41:23.887
There is more down there

41:23.940 --> 41:25.680
Than you know

41:27.730 --> 41:30.563
There is more down there

41:30.610 --> 41:32.601
Than you know

42:02.430 --> 42:07.265
You move like a bird

42:08.900 --> 42:11.778
With a wounded wing

42:11.820 --> 42:14.141
And wounded nerves

42:15.740 --> 42:18.698
There is more down there

42:18.740 --> 42:21.482
Than you know

42:28.120 --> 42:29.951
Oh, oui, oui.
