00:05.853 --> 00:08.821
Who do you guys think
is the sexiest character

00:08.823 --> 00:10.372
<i>in the Star Wars Universe?</i>

00:10.408 --> 00:12.574
- Well, I mean, I...
- Remember, you can go anywhere.

00:12.626 --> 00:14.410
- You don't have to be stuck...
- With humans.

00:14.462 --> 00:16.078
[Laughter]

00:16.129 --> 00:17.997
Uh, I mean, the obvious
choice is Princess Leia.

00:17.999 --> 00:21.083
Again, I don't expect
anything more from you

00:21.135 --> 00:22.334
than jumping on a bandwagon.

00:22.336 --> 00:24.837
[Laughter]

00:24.839 --> 00:26.171
Um, who do you think, Mike?

00:26.173 --> 00:27.723
I'm gonna go with Malla

00:27.758 --> 00:30.509
<i>from the Star Wars Holiday Special.</i>

00:30.511 --> 00:31.894
Wait a minute. Wait. Don't tell me.

00:31.929 --> 00:34.013
- That was, uh...
- Chewbacca's wife!

00:34.065 --> 00:35.848
[Laughter]

00:35.900 --> 00:37.516
You definitely dig '70s bush, bro.

00:37.518 --> 00:39.435
[Laughter]

00:39.487 --> 00:40.903
How about you? Who do you think?

00:40.938 --> 00:44.189
I'm gonna go droid on you.

00:44.241 --> 00:46.275
R2-D2.

00:46.327 --> 00:49.111
There was just something about
the way that little bot moved,

00:49.163 --> 00:50.529
the way it, like, twirled around

00:50.531 --> 00:52.698
and it, like, made those weird noises.

00:52.700 --> 00:55.534
When he got all excited and
he'd swivel, he'd be like...

00:55.536 --> 00:58.037
- [Laughter]
- That's really good!

00:58.089 --> 01:00.289
- Rocking back and forth, right?
- Don't get him excited!

01:00.341 --> 01:02.458
I imagine that's what, like,
a droid doing a go-go dance

01:02.510 --> 01:04.293
- must look like, right?
- Mm-hmm.

01:04.345 --> 01:06.545
Yeah, like R2-D2 pole dancing.

01:06.547 --> 01:08.714
[Laughter]

01:08.716 --> 01:10.632
Just spinning around that pole.

01:10.684 --> 01:13.052
[Laughter]

<i>Hello, and welcome to another
episode of Comic Book Men,</i>

01:51.425 --> 01:54.009
the only show that had an
amazing dream last night

01:54.061 --> 01:56.929
about winning the
Stanley Cup with Stan Lee.

01:56.981 --> 01:58.430
I'm your host, Kevin Smith.

01:58.432 --> 02:00.265
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

02:00.317 --> 02:01.683
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

02:01.735 --> 02:04.019
I have one favorite retail store

02:04.071 --> 02:06.605
on the entire pla... well,
two, after the fooderies.

02:06.607 --> 02:08.857
This store. What happened in it this week?

02:08.908 --> 02:11.276
"Wabbit" season officially
opened at the stash.

02:11.278 --> 02:12.277
Oh!

02:16.834 --> 02:18.283
- Hi.
- Hey, how you doing?

02:18.285 --> 02:19.952
Good. Are you guys
fans of looney tunes?

02:20.004 --> 02:21.286
- We are.
- Well, I have something

02:21.338 --> 02:23.622
- that might be of interest.
- Oh.

02:23.674 --> 02:25.457
This is baseball bugs.

02:25.459 --> 02:28.710
It's a limited edition, I
have number one out of 1,200,

02:28.762 --> 02:31.296
signed, and artwork by Friz Freleng.

02:31.298 --> 02:32.965
- What's up, doc?
- [Laughs]

02:40.558 --> 02:42.057
Is this the one
that's like, "strike one,

02:42.109 --> 02:43.809
- strike two, strike three"?
- Yes.

02:43.811 --> 02:45.477
- "Hey, batter, batter, batter!"
- Yes, that's the one.

02:45.529 --> 02:47.312
That's probably one of
my favorite bugs bunny bits.

02:47.314 --> 02:49.064
This is my favorite.

02:49.116 --> 02:52.651
Now, this doesn't appear to
be a cel used in the cartoon.

02:52.653 --> 02:54.319
It's not a production cel.

02:54.321 --> 02:55.988
Friz did this artwork

02:56.040 --> 02:58.574
specifically for the 1,200 edition.

02:58.626 --> 03:00.242
Where'd you get it from?

03:00.294 --> 03:02.661
I got it from the circle
gallery in New York City.

03:02.713 --> 03:04.713
I was just new out of
college, and I thought,

03:04.748 --> 03:06.498
"this would be a great investment."

03:06.550 --> 03:08.584
I think I had that. I was a
big Warner Brothers collector.

03:08.636 --> 03:10.502
I think I kept them in business

03:10.504 --> 03:11.753
for a long, long time.

03:11.805 --> 03:13.589
I didn't buy them as investments.

03:13.641 --> 03:15.507
I wasn't like, "these are gonna
be worth millions one day."

03:15.559 --> 03:18.427
I bought 'em 'cause I was like,
"these belong in a museum."

03:18.479 --> 03:21.013
Like, I was young Indiana Jones. [Laughter]

03:21.015 --> 03:23.515
Oh, I like that. Does
whipping out your credit card

03:23.567 --> 03:25.601
count as archeology? [Laughter]

03:25.653 --> 03:28.604
Is bugs bunny your favorite
Warner Brothers character?

03:28.656 --> 03:30.272
Absolutely.

03:30.324 --> 03:31.857
Who's your favorite
Warner Brothers creation?

03:31.909 --> 03:33.609
Probably Tweety Bird, like...
[high-pitched grunting]

03:33.661 --> 03:35.027
Have you ever heard his
Tweety Bird? It's awesome.

03:35.079 --> 03:36.612
- No, it's, uh...
- I want to hear that.

03:36.664 --> 03:38.447
[High-pitched voice]:
"I tot I taw a puddy tat!"

03:38.499 --> 03:41.083
[Laughter] "I did! I did!"

03:41.118 --> 03:42.701
[Normal voice] Yeah, you know,

03:42.703 --> 03:44.870
I mean, it always cracked me
up as a kid... it still does.

03:44.922 --> 03:47.422
Uh, you're coming in today to sell it?

03:47.458 --> 03:48.874
I'm here to sell it.

03:48.926 --> 03:51.710
And what are you trying
to get for it today?

03:51.762 --> 03:54.379
I'm asking $2,000.

03:54.381 --> 03:56.381
Um, $2,000, huh?

03:56.433 --> 03:59.051
Any chance you'd take $1,050?

03:59.053 --> 04:00.636
I think that's a little low.

04:00.688 --> 04:02.387
Mm, $1,250?

04:02.439 --> 04:04.439
That's still too low.

04:04.475 --> 04:06.225
Sufferin' succotash.

04:06.277 --> 04:09.278
[Laughter] Uh...

04:09.313 --> 04:12.397
Like, it's awesome, but
I can't pull the trigger

04:12.399 --> 04:14.449
on anywhere near what you're looking for.

04:14.485 --> 04:16.235
I think I'm gonna have to pass on it.

04:16.286 --> 04:18.120
I appreciate you bringing it in, man.

04:18.154 --> 04:20.072
- It's an awesome piece.
- Oh, you're welcome.

04:20.074 --> 04:21.456
- Thanks for looking at it.
- Thank you.

04:21.492 --> 04:22.824
- Yeah, good luck with that.
- Thank you.

04:22.876 --> 04:24.626
- All right.
- See you later, then.

04:24.662 --> 04:28.130
- Thank you. Bye-bye.
- T-t-t-t-t-that's all, folks.

04:28.165 --> 04:29.748
[Laughter]

04:29.750 --> 04:31.750
How was that? Was that
worse than his Tweety?

04:31.752 --> 04:32.751
- No.
- No.

04:32.753 --> 04:34.469
It was ten times better.

04:34.505 --> 04:37.306
Felt like I was in the
presence of Mel Blanc there.

04:37.341 --> 04:39.925
[Laughing]

04:39.927 --> 04:41.810
You're Billy Dee Williams.

04:41.845 --> 04:43.095
Yeah. Yep, that's me.

04:43.147 --> 04:44.646
I'm really looking

04:44.682 --> 04:47.266
<i>for this thing they call
the Millennium Falcon.</i>

04:47.268 --> 04:48.267
Oh!

04:56.670 --> 04:58.202
- How you doing?
- Hey, doing good.

04:58.254 --> 05:00.038
I came by to see if maybe
you would be interested

05:00.040 --> 05:02.707
in my 1986 Amtoy my pet monster.

05:02.759 --> 05:04.208
What is this?

05:04.260 --> 05:05.710
You don't remember the my pet monster?

05:05.712 --> 05:07.712
It wasn't on my radar back then, man.

05:14.637 --> 05:16.604
- This was big in the '80s?
- It was.

05:16.639 --> 05:18.272
I had one of these when
I was six years old,

05:18.308 --> 05:19.891
and it was my wrestling partner.

05:19.893 --> 05:21.559
I would have him in the living room,

05:21.561 --> 05:23.644
and I'd break the Handcuffs
off and drop elbows on him.

05:23.697 --> 05:24.779
[Laughter]

05:24.814 --> 05:25.896
I'm telling you right now,

05:25.896 --> 05:28.232
what's really weirding me
out is the nose.

05:28.284 --> 05:30.735
I cannot believe that is the nose

05:30.787 --> 05:33.237
on the pet monster that
they marketed for kids.

05:33.239 --> 05:35.456
He looks like a diseased sailor.

05:35.492 --> 05:39.577
[Laughter]

05:39.579 --> 05:41.963
You can't tell me that the designers

05:41.998 --> 05:44.749
of this pet monster weren't in on a joke,

05:44.751 --> 05:47.635
- because this monster's nose...
- [Laughs]

05:47.670 --> 05:49.470
- It was crazy.
- It was pretty phallic.

05:49.506 --> 05:51.089
[Laughter]

05:51.091 --> 05:52.840
Yeah, it's definitely
the memorable feature

05:52.892 --> 05:54.592
when you look at it.

05:54.644 --> 05:56.344
I mean, they had to know, as
they got it past corporate...

05:56.396 --> 05:57.929
[Imitates snickering]

05:57.931 --> 05:59.263
You know, that they approved it.

05:59.315 --> 06:01.432
Fun for kids, funner for moms.

06:01.484 --> 06:03.601
[Laughter]

06:03.603 --> 06:04.986
You trying to sell it today?

06:05.021 --> 06:06.687
Yeah, I'm trying to sell it today.

06:06.740 --> 06:08.156
I've got a seven-year-old,
and she's really stoked

06:08.191 --> 06:09.657
about going on a Disney trip.

06:09.692 --> 06:11.609
And I figured if I
could sell one of my toys

06:11.661 --> 06:13.828
to provide something for
her, it would be worth doing.

06:13.863 --> 06:15.947
All right, well, what are
you looking to get for it?

06:15.999 --> 06:19.367
I'd like to get $300 for it.

06:19.419 --> 06:21.119
- Disney, you say?
- I told you...

06:21.171 --> 06:24.622
- Disney's not cheap.
- What do these run?

06:24.624 --> 06:26.207
You know, this box is pretty beat up.

06:26.259 --> 06:27.675
There's a little wear on here,

06:27.710 --> 06:29.177
definitely showing a little bit of age.

06:29.212 --> 06:31.546
Mint, in box, it'd be, like, $275.

06:31.598 --> 06:33.714
All right, would you take $100 for it?

06:33.767 --> 06:35.183
This bad boy's in a box.

06:35.218 --> 06:36.684
You can't find any of these guys in a box.

06:36.719 --> 06:38.519
It's got the Handcuffs.

06:38.555 --> 06:41.689
I would work with you a
little bit and go to $250.

06:41.724 --> 06:44.642
How about $125?

06:44.644 --> 06:47.145
No. I don't think I can do $125.

06:47.197 --> 06:50.064
I'll work with you a little bit
more and go down to 200 bucks.

06:50.116 --> 06:51.732
How about $175?

06:51.785 --> 06:53.951
Hmm...

06:56.206 --> 06:58.990
I'm gonna have to let that pass, my friend.

06:58.992 --> 07:01.659
Well, I think that's as high
as I can go on it, you know.

07:01.661 --> 07:03.161
That's all right. I
really appreciate you guys

07:03.163 --> 07:04.745
taking the time to take a look at it.

07:04.798 --> 07:06.497
- I'm sorry, though.
- That's all right.

07:06.499 --> 07:08.382
- Take care.
- Take care.

07:14.474 --> 07:16.174
Hi.

07:16.176 --> 07:18.342
How are you?

07:18.344 --> 07:20.344
This place is incredible.

07:20.346 --> 07:22.180
Oh, my... you're
Billy Dee Williams.

07:22.182 --> 07:23.731
Yeah. Yep, that's me.

07:23.766 --> 07:25.349
It's an honor to have you at the stash.

07:25.401 --> 07:27.018
- Well, nice to see it.
- Huge fan.

07:27.070 --> 07:28.402
- Okay.
- How you doing?

07:28.438 --> 07:29.687
- It's an honor, sir.
- Good, good.

07:29.689 --> 07:31.072
- Nice to see you.
- How you doing?

07:31.107 --> 07:32.940
I'm really looking

07:32.992 --> 07:36.110
<i>for this thing they call
the Millennium Falcon.</i>

07:36.162 --> 07:37.862
Oh!

07:37.864 --> 07:39.614
<i>You used to pilot the
Millennium Falcon, right?</i>

07:39.666 --> 07:41.365
Yeah, right.

07:41.367 --> 07:43.784
Yes, but the one I'm looking
for is this really big one.

07:43.837 --> 07:45.870
- The massive one?
- Yeah, the massive one. Yeah.

07:45.922 --> 07:47.455
- We have the massive one.
- You do?

07:47.507 --> 07:49.040
Yeah. You guys want to go grab

07:49.042 --> 07:50.758
<i>the gigantic Millennium Falcon?</i>

07:50.793 --> 07:52.710
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Oh, fantastic.

07:52.762 --> 07:55.429
These guys are my version
of the Lobot and the Ugnaught.

07:55.465 --> 07:57.715
Well... [laughter]

07:57.717 --> 08:00.468
Billy Dee Williams
came in? Get out of here!

08:00.520 --> 08:03.054
Lando Calrissian came into the stash?

08:03.106 --> 08:04.639
That's tremendous!

08:04.691 --> 08:08.142
The thing about Billy
Dee is, like, as Lando,

08:08.194 --> 08:10.394
as the colt 45 pitchman,

08:10.446 --> 08:13.564
like, he's always very
suave, very smooth, right?

08:13.616 --> 08:15.233
He was the ultimate smooth.

08:15.235 --> 08:17.318
My mom was a big fan of Diana Ross,

08:17.370 --> 08:19.737
<i>and he was in lady sings the blues.</i>

08:19.739 --> 08:21.405
<i>So when he showed up
in Empire strikes back,</i>

08:21.457 --> 08:23.407
I was like, "that's Lando Calrissian."

08:23.459 --> 08:25.126
My mom was like,

08:25.161 --> 08:26.577
<i>"oh, that's the man from
lady sings the blues."</i>

08:26.579 --> 08:27.828
[Laughter]

08:27.881 --> 08:29.247
He was very smooth. She liked him.

08:29.299 --> 08:33.167
- There it is.
- Oh, be careful with it.

08:33.219 --> 08:34.585
- Huh?
- Wow.

08:34.636 --> 08:36.804
- What do you think?
- This is fantastic.

08:36.839 --> 08:40.424
I'm getting this for my little grandson.

08:40.476 --> 08:42.143
- Awesome, man.
- Yeah, he's gonna love this.

08:42.178 --> 08:43.928
I don't know if his mother's gonna love it.

08:43.980 --> 08:46.514
[Laughter]

08:46.566 --> 08:48.482
So what was it like
when you were piloting

08:48.518 --> 08:50.184
<i>the Millennium Falcon?</i>

08:50.236 --> 08:52.353
- Well, it was a lot of fun.
- You are a badass, man...

08:52.405 --> 08:54.605
the baddest ass in the whole galaxy.

08:54.607 --> 08:58.442
Well, the cape, to me, was
the key to that character.

08:58.494 --> 09:00.444
And, you know, a lot of people say

09:00.496 --> 09:02.947
<i>Han Solo's the coolest character
in the Star Wars universe.</i>

09:02.999 --> 09:05.116
No, I think bar
none, you were the...

09:05.168 --> 09:07.785
- who said Han Solo is the...
- There are some people.

09:07.787 --> 09:09.670
I'm not gonna
mention names, but, I-I...

09:09.706 --> 09:11.505
they have no idea what
they're talking about.

09:11.541 --> 09:12.707
- Exactly.
- Okay.

09:12.759 --> 09:14.292
So what are you looking for?

09:14.344 --> 09:15.876
Well, we're looking
to get $1,500 for it.

09:15.929 --> 09:19.680
Oh! [Laughter]

09:19.716 --> 09:22.717
Oh, my... I'm gonna
have a heart attack.

09:22.769 --> 09:24.218
You got to be joking.

09:24.270 --> 09:25.853
I mean, there's only 500 of these left

09:25.888 --> 09:27.855
- in the whole world.
- I can't do that.

09:27.890 --> 09:29.690
- You can't do $1,500?
- No, I can do, like...

09:29.726 --> 09:32.810
what about $500?

09:32.812 --> 09:34.895
$500! Oh!

09:34.948 --> 09:36.480
Come on, it needs work.

09:36.532 --> 09:38.065
<i>How did the story go in Empire?</i>

09:38.117 --> 09:39.817
<i>How did you lose the Millennium Falcon</i>

09:39.869 --> 09:41.485
to Han Solo?

09:41.487 --> 09:43.821
It was a card game. We had a card game.

09:43.823 --> 09:45.573
Why don't we have a card game?

09:45.625 --> 09:47.325
- A card game?
- Yeah.

09:47.377 --> 09:49.493
- What do you mean, like, play...
- Play for this.

09:49.545 --> 09:52.079
So, like, if you win,
you name your price.

09:52.131 --> 09:54.665
- If I win, I get my price.
- You said it.

09:54.717 --> 09:56.083
Are you guys serious?

09:56.135 --> 09:57.918
I mean, we do have a
poker table back there.

09:57.971 --> 09:59.720
- Okay, well, let's do it.
- [Laughs]

09:59.756 --> 10:01.339
Well, what's your game?

10:01.341 --> 10:04.008
It's a little poker,
a little five-card stud.

10:04.060 --> 10:05.843
I'm gonna be honest
with you, Mr. Williams.

10:05.845 --> 10:08.929
I'm not much of a man's man, so, um...

10:08.982 --> 10:10.564
I don't know any of those games. Uh...

10:10.600 --> 10:12.433
Well, I wasn't gonna
say anything, but...

10:12.485 --> 10:14.101
[Laughter]

10:14.153 --> 10:16.687
I kind of... I mean, I'm
really good at go fish,

10:16.689 --> 10:18.522
because I got two daughters,

10:18.574 --> 10:20.358
and, you know, I take 'em
for everything they got.

10:20.360 --> 10:21.909
Well, let's do it.

10:21.944 --> 10:23.444
<i>You'll play for the Millennium Falcon</i>

10:23.496 --> 10:24.862
- over go fish?
- Absolutely.

10:24.864 --> 10:26.364
- All right, man, I'm all-in.
- Okay.

10:26.366 --> 10:28.032
- Let's do it.
- All right.

10:28.084 --> 10:29.867
I brought you something
from from another dimension.

10:29.869 --> 10:32.753
Really? that's amazing.

10:34.308 --> 10:35.641
There's basically two Landos.

10:35.693 --> 10:37.276
<i>He wasn't in Star Wars.</i>

10:37.311 --> 10:38.944
<i>He's in Empire, and he's in Jedi.</i>

10:38.979 --> 10:40.729
<i>In Empire, he's the
guy that sells them out,</i>

10:40.781 --> 10:42.147
<i>but in return of the Jedi,</i>

10:42.199 --> 10:44.450
he helps destroy the second death star.

10:44.485 --> 10:46.318
Which Lando do you prefer?

10:46.370 --> 10:47.736
<i>Easily in Empire strikes back.</i>

10:47.788 --> 10:49.655
I love when he takes a run at darth vader,

10:49.707 --> 10:51.907
even though he knows
there's no chance in hell

10:51.959 --> 10:53.959
he can beat darth vader,
he's like, "I'm going for it."

10:53.994 --> 10:56.078
- Yes.
- That's a badass...

10:56.080 --> 10:57.996
<i>Because in Return Of the Jedi,
he's... nothing bad about him.</i>

10:58.048 --> 10:59.465
Like, suddenly, he's with the Rebels,

10:59.500 --> 11:00.666
and you're like, "where's your cape?"

11:00.718 --> 11:02.084
It looks like somebody likes him.

11:02.086 --> 11:03.585
He's shaking his head. [Laughter]

11:03.587 --> 11:05.337
<i>You like Return Of the Jedi Lando?</i>

11:05.389 --> 11:07.923
Absolutely. I mean,
listen, I'm a loyal guy.

11:07.925 --> 11:11.093
'Cause he looks like an Ewok. [Laughter]

11:11.095 --> 11:13.011
Treacherous Lando, man, is...

11:13.063 --> 11:15.647
even though he betrays our heroes,

11:15.683 --> 11:18.650
you still liked him quite a
bit 'cause he tried to do right.

11:18.686 --> 11:21.437
He was just basically trying
to cover his ass in cloud city.

11:21.489 --> 11:23.939
Then he wanted to take
care of Han and Leia,

11:23.991 --> 11:25.524
only a little bit too late for Han.

11:25.576 --> 11:28.277
What do you think
happened to Bespin after...

11:28.279 --> 11:29.778
<i>after Empire strikes back, though?</i>

11:29.780 --> 11:31.830
[Laughter]

11:31.866 --> 11:33.665
Probably gone, gone, gone.

11:33.701 --> 11:36.618
I mean, would you trust that
guy anymore if he was your mayor?

11:36.670 --> 11:38.203
Like, at one point, he
gets out, and he's like,

11:38.255 --> 11:40.789
"this is Lando Calrissian. Clear the city!"

11:40.841 --> 11:43.842
[Laughter]

11:54.397 --> 11:55.414
Hey, how you doing?

11:55.414 --> 11:56.432
- Hey, guys. How's it going?
- Good.

11:56.539 --> 11:58.706
I brought you something
from another dimension.

11:58.758 --> 12:01.297
- Really?
- Yeah!

12:01.448 --> 12:03.982
<i>Twilight Zone trading cards.</i>

12:04.034 --> 12:05.984
But not just the trading cards...

12:06.036 --> 12:09.905
I've got the autographed cards,
including William Shatner,

12:09.957 --> 12:11.206
George Takei.

12:11.241 --> 12:13.041
I have Buddy Epson, Jack Klugman.

12:13.077 --> 12:14.409
So all the, uh...

12:14.461 --> 12:15.661
these are all the autographed cards.

12:15.663 --> 12:16.828
All the actors that played in it?

12:16.880 --> 12:19.381
- Yeah.
- That's amazing.

12:26.890 --> 12:30.559
You know, these cards... they
were only sold two to a box.

12:30.594 --> 12:32.060
So you had to really search for them

12:32.096 --> 12:33.845
in order to fill this collection.

12:33.897 --> 12:35.514
- How'd you get 'em?
- They were so hard to find.

12:35.566 --> 12:38.183
I had to keep buying
boxes of cards at a time.

12:38.185 --> 12:40.102
So I was insane.

12:40.154 --> 12:42.270
But it was so exciting,
because every time I found one,

12:42.323 --> 12:45.023
it brought back memories of the episode.

12:45.075 --> 12:46.858
<i>I love the Twilight Zone.</i>

12:46.910 --> 12:48.860
It's the short story of television.

12:48.912 --> 12:51.196
I mean, everyone now
thinks of a twist ending

12:51.198 --> 12:52.948
as M. Night Shyamalan.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.701
<i>Well, the Twilight Zone did
a twist ending every week.</i>

12:55.753 --> 12:58.754
Hundreds of episodes of brilliant writing

12:58.789 --> 13:01.790
hosted by the amazing
creator himself, Rod Serling.

13:01.842 --> 13:03.959
Can't you just imagine
that, when you die,

13:04.011 --> 13:05.544
you're gonna be
greeted by Rod Serling,

13:05.596 --> 13:07.212
and he's gonna tell you
which way you're going?

13:07.214 --> 13:08.880
- I'll take it.
- Right?

13:08.932 --> 13:10.882
Yeah, I'll take that over
this heaven and hell stuff.

13:10.884 --> 13:13.135
Just let me meet Rod
Serling and have him be like,

13:13.187 --> 13:16.138
"submitted for your
approval. You live forever."

13:16.190 --> 13:18.273
And he's smoking a cigarette. Ah!

13:18.308 --> 13:20.642
So metal. [Laughter]

13:20.694 --> 13:23.612
And you're coming in
today 'cause you're...

13:23.647 --> 13:26.114
I can't imagine you're willing
to part with this, right?

13:26.150 --> 13:28.283
I mean, this is a lifelong endeavor here.

13:28.318 --> 13:30.118
This is hard for me, but I'm at a point

13:30.154 --> 13:31.737
where I need a bunch of cash.

13:31.789 --> 13:33.789
I got to be up front.

13:33.824 --> 13:36.742
The stash has a "no trading card" policy.

13:36.794 --> 13:38.910
- Does it really?
- I find that trading cards

13:38.912 --> 13:40.629
- is a pyramid scheme.
- [Laughs]

13:40.664 --> 13:43.081
Like, at least if you're into comics,

13:43.083 --> 13:45.250
you buy your comic, you
know what you're getting.

13:45.252 --> 13:49.171
You buy a pack of cards,
it's a total lottery ticket

13:49.223 --> 13:51.306
that usually, just like
the regular lottery,

13:51.341 --> 13:52.507
you're a loser.

13:52.559 --> 13:54.176
I can admit it. I'm anti-card.

13:54.228 --> 13:55.977
That's an excellent point, man.

13:56.013 --> 13:57.763
It's just like, you don't
go into a comic book store

13:57.765 --> 13:59.514
and you open up a big
package, and they're like,

13:59.566 --> 14:00.849
"here's ten comics.

14:00.901 --> 14:02.517
One's all right. the rest are crap."

14:02.569 --> 14:04.319
[Laughs]

14:04.354 --> 14:05.771
That's why I've always
been against trading cards,

14:05.773 --> 14:07.606
but, boy, I was really, really tempted

14:07.608 --> 14:10.992
because these are signed by some
of Hollywood's all-time greats,

14:11.028 --> 14:13.328
and I'm thinking, like,
"this is gonna be, you know,

14:13.363 --> 14:16.698
a pretty penny to secure this set."

14:16.750 --> 14:19.334
How much do you think you've
sunk into this collection?

14:19.369 --> 14:21.953
- Oh, several thousand.
- So wait.

14:22.005 --> 14:24.039
So what are you looking
to get for this set today?

14:24.091 --> 14:25.957
Well, I valued out
this whole set of cards,

14:26.009 --> 14:28.293
and it came out to $7,500.

14:28.295 --> 14:33.131
So I'm looking for
somewhere between 5 and 6.

14:33.133 --> 14:34.399
I mean, it's definitely cool.

14:34.435 --> 14:35.967
It's definitely, like,

14:35.969 --> 14:38.553
the coolest trading-card
set I've ever seen.

14:38.605 --> 14:40.889
But, again, I mean,

14:40.941 --> 14:43.558
due to the stash's "no card" policy,

14:43.610 --> 14:45.360
I'm afraid we're gonna have to pass.

14:45.395 --> 14:47.195
But I can't thank you enough
for bringing them in, man.

14:47.231 --> 14:49.197
Some great memories stirred up.

14:49.233 --> 14:50.649
- Best of luck.
- Thank you. thank you.

14:50.651 --> 14:52.701
Thank you. Appreciate it.

14:54.822 --> 14:58.323
All right, Mr. Williams, the
name of the game is go fish.

14:58.325 --> 15:01.326
First one to have no cards is the winner.

15:01.378 --> 15:04.830
Okay, you don't mind
rolling your sleeves up?

15:04.882 --> 15:06.882
- [Laughter]
- Rolling my sleeves up?

15:06.917 --> 15:08.250
- Yeah.
- Sure.

15:08.302 --> 15:10.719
I mean, I'm not trying to accuse you.

15:10.754 --> 15:12.170
I've seen him play go fish.

15:12.172 --> 15:13.588
You should have him take his shirt off.

15:13.640 --> 15:15.223
[Laughter]

15:15.259 --> 15:17.175
As surreal as it sounds,

15:17.227 --> 15:19.928
me and Billy Dee Williams
start playing go fish

15:19.980 --> 15:22.597
<i>over the stakes of the Millennium Falcon.</i>

15:22.649 --> 15:25.600
Rewriting cinema history

15:25.652 --> 15:28.019
<i>just in time for the new Star Wars movie</i>

15:28.021 --> 15:29.404
<i>to be like, "you know
how the Millennium Falcon</i>

15:29.439 --> 15:30.689
was really won?

15:30.741 --> 15:32.607
At a comic book store in New Jersey."

15:32.659 --> 15:33.742
[Laughs]

15:38.165 --> 15:40.949
All right...

15:41.001 --> 15:43.285
[Breathes deeply]

15:43.337 --> 15:44.953
Okay.

15:45.005 --> 15:48.123
You got a 7?

15:48.175 --> 15:51.042
- I do.
- Oh!

15:51.044 --> 15:53.461
Okay, you got an ace?

15:56.884 --> 15:59.100
Oh!

16:02.472 --> 16:03.972
You got an 8?

16:04.024 --> 16:07.309
- An 8?
- Yeah.

16:07.361 --> 16:10.278
Mr. Williams, go fish.

16:10.314 --> 16:13.064
You no-good swindler, Walt.

16:13.116 --> 16:16.401
[Laughter]

16:16.403 --> 16:18.069
[Exhales deeply] Sweating it there.

16:18.121 --> 16:19.487
I thought he was gonna
go for a clean sweep.

16:19.540 --> 16:20.739
Wait. Wait.

16:20.791 --> 16:22.324
Hello!

16:22.376 --> 16:24.492
What do we have here?

16:26.463 --> 16:28.413
Oh!

16:28.465 --> 16:33.134
Mr. Williams, do you have a 6?

16:33.170 --> 16:35.337
Walt...

16:35.389 --> 16:37.389
Go fish, baby.

16:40.644 --> 16:42.177
You're not that good at go fish.

16:42.229 --> 16:45.013
And how does one become good at go fish?

16:45.065 --> 16:47.766
- It's all by chance, bro.
- You said you were!

16:47.768 --> 16:51.486
[Laughter]

16:51.521 --> 16:54.155
- What do you need?
- You got a 9?

16:55.859 --> 16:57.158
Oh, my God.

16:59.717 --> 17:03.135
Sure would be a shame if you
lost the falcon a second time,

17:03.187 --> 17:05.137
wouldn't it?

17:05.138 --> 17:07.306
Do you have a king?

17:07.308 --> 17:09.691
Walter...

17:09.727 --> 17:13.311
Go fish.

17:13.364 --> 17:16.147
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

17:16.200 --> 17:18.567
It works every time.

17:18.618 --> 17:21.153
It wasn't a friendly game. It was...

17:21.204 --> 17:24.873
it was possibly the most intense
game of go fish I've ever seen.

17:24.909 --> 17:26.825
Were there hostilities during this game?

17:26.827 --> 17:29.661
I-I... you know, not
outright, but the looks...

17:29.663 --> 17:31.380
the machismo is gonna flow.

17:31.415 --> 17:32.881
You can't help it.

17:32.917 --> 17:34.833
You're in a card game with big stakes,

17:34.835 --> 17:36.502
- high stakes.
- Truly.

17:36.504 --> 17:39.421
Two men at the table,
gambling for a spaceship...

17:39.473 --> 17:41.590
[Laughter] A child's toy.

17:41.642 --> 17:43.425
Absolutely, stakes are high.

17:43.477 --> 17:45.260
You could cut the
testosterone with a knife.

17:45.312 --> 17:47.563
[Laughter]

17:47.598 --> 17:50.516
Mr. Williams, do you have a 6?

17:50.568 --> 17:52.684
Walt, go fish.

17:52.686 --> 17:55.404
- How about a king?
- Go fish.

17:55.439 --> 17:57.406
- A 10?
- Go fish, Walt.

17:57.441 --> 18:00.442
[Laughter]

18:00.494 --> 18:03.695
You got a 6?

18:03.697 --> 18:06.198
Better get your fishing
pole out... you're going fishing.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.784
You had me on the ropes there.
I thought he was taking...

18:08.836 --> 18:10.119
I thought I was gonna
be sitting here...

18:10.171 --> 18:13.205
- oh, wait, wait, wait, wait!
- Oh!

18:13.207 --> 18:14.706
Oh, my God, all right.

18:14.758 --> 18:16.959
It's one card away
from being in Carbonite.

18:17.011 --> 18:19.878
[Laughter]

18:19.930 --> 18:22.431
What do you need?

18:30.441 --> 18:31.640
You got a 9?

18:34.812 --> 18:36.445
Oh, my God.

18:36.480 --> 18:38.730
<i>I just lost the Millennium Falcon</i>

18:38.732 --> 18:41.400
to Lando Calrissian.

18:43.621 --> 18:46.788
Don't let the smooth taste fool you.

18:46.824 --> 18:49.491
So now he's Han, and you're Lando...

18:49.543 --> 18:51.743
Except you're not cool.

18:51.745 --> 18:55.164
- [Laughter]
- Oh, my God.

18:55.216 --> 18:57.082
Oh, man.

18:57.084 --> 19:01.420
[Laughter]

19:01.472 --> 19:05.140
You don't have to gloat! [Laughter]

19:05.176 --> 19:07.176
- He beat you.
- He beat me fair and square.

19:07.228 --> 19:08.760
I'm starting to think
it wasn't fair and square,

19:08.762 --> 19:10.596
because it's the most pairs that win.

19:10.648 --> 19:12.431
You probably won and don't even know it.

19:12.483 --> 19:14.683
[Laughter]

19:14.735 --> 19:17.486
Do you understand the rules of go fish?

19:17.521 --> 19:19.104
You should've looked
at your other cards.

19:19.106 --> 19:20.439
I had no pairs, man.

19:20.441 --> 19:22.274
I know it's seemingly impossible

19:22.276 --> 19:24.610
to have that many cards and
not have any pairs, but...

19:24.662 --> 19:26.662
He was missing a pair, I'll tell you.

19:26.697 --> 19:28.697
[Laughter]

19:28.749 --> 19:30.666
<i>I'm very thrilled to finally
see the Millennium Falcon</i>

19:30.701 --> 19:32.451
go back to its rightful owner.

19:32.503 --> 19:34.119
Well, thank you very much.

19:34.121 --> 19:35.504
It's been great doing
business with you guys.

19:35.539 --> 19:37.122
- Mr. Williams.
- A pleasure.

19:37.124 --> 19:38.624
- Okay, you guys take care.
- Nice to meet you.

19:38.626 --> 19:40.125
- Okay, thanks a lot.
- Thank you very much.

19:40.177 --> 19:41.677
Before you go...

19:41.712 --> 19:43.712
Your word... not a scratch, right?

19:43.764 --> 19:46.798
[Chuckles] You get out
of here, you old pirate.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.850
[Laughter]

19:48.886 --> 19:50.219
- Oh!
- Awesome!

19:50.271 --> 19:52.554
- [Laughs]
- Later.

19:55.893 --> 19:59.194
[High-pitched voice]:
Good-bye. Good-bye, Lando.

19:59.230 --> 20:01.813
It was a bit bittersweet, you know,

20:01.815 --> 20:03.815
<i>to lose the Millennium Falcon, you know,</i>

20:03.817 --> 20:05.734
for a song, basically, you know?

20:05.786 --> 20:08.870
<i>Billy Dee Williams got a good
deal on that Millennium Falcon</i>

20:08.906 --> 20:12.074
from the stash that day, but...

20:12.126 --> 20:14.910
the memories the stash got are priceless.

20:14.962 --> 20:16.211
I don't know, man.

20:16.247 --> 20:18.880
You sat down with
a screen legend...

20:18.916 --> 20:23.719
a guy who not only sold
out Han Solo to the Empire,

20:23.754 --> 20:27.339
then made up for it by
destroying the second death star

20:27.341 --> 20:29.007
<i>in Return Of the Jedi.</i>

20:29.059 --> 20:32.344
This is as big as it gets
for the secret stash, man.

20:32.396 --> 20:34.513
<i>That's... I don't know if we've
ever had Star Wars royalty</i>

20:34.565 --> 20:36.898
- in the store before.
- Never.

20:36.934 --> 20:38.733
I only wish my mom
had been here to be like,

20:38.893 --> 20:41.544
"there he is. there's
that Billy Dee Williams."
