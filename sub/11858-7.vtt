00:16.000 --> 00:19.083
Please don't hurt me.
How did you get in here?

00:20.291 --> 00:21.458
No!

00:23.375 --> 00:24.583
- Oh!
- Ouch!

00:24.667 --> 00:26.583
Frankenstein,
are you alright?

00:26.667 --> 00:29.333
It's not funny,
mom. I can't
see.

00:29.417 --> 00:31.792
The mask takes away
my perfil vision.

00:31.875 --> 00:34.166
Oh, I'll cut
the eyeholes bigger.

00:34.250 --> 00:37.583
Don't worry, Dobber. You'll
have the best costume tomorrow.

00:39.917 --> 00:40.834
Oh.

00:40.917 --> 00:42.250
- Pops!
- Oh.

00:47.041 --> 00:49.625
Hi, pop. I'm gonna be
Frankenstein for Halloween.

00:49.709 --> 00:51.000
That's swell, champ.

00:51.083 --> 00:53.125
Hello, dear. Looking
beautiful this
evening.

00:53.208 --> 00:55.625
- Supper ready?
- 20 more minutes.

00:55.709 --> 00:57.291
How was work?

00:57.375 --> 00:58.417
Another great day.

01:01.041 --> 01:02.250
"The Edgar Bergen Show!"

01:02.333 --> 01:03.291
We're missing it.

01:03.375 --> 01:05.166
Well, go put it on.

01:06.875 --> 01:08.041
Thanks, pet.

01:13.583 --> 01:15.458
(male #1 on radio)
'Ladies and gentlemen,
we interrupt our program'

01:15.542 --> 01:17.375
'of dance music to bring
you a special bulletin'

01:17.458 --> 01:19.458

8:00 Central Time'

01:21.625 --> 01:23.875
'Professor Ferrell of
the Mount Jennings Observatory'

01:24.000 --> 01:26.166
'Chicago, Illinois,

01:26.250 --> 01:29.000
'several explosions of
incandescent gas occurring'

01:29.083 --> 01:30.917
'at regular intervals
on the planet Mars..'

01:31.000 --> 01:32.959
(male #2 on radio)
'There's something happening.'

01:33.041 --> 01:35.125
'A humped shape is
rising out of the pit.'

01:35.208 --> 01:38.041
'The mouth is...kind
of V-shaped with saliva.'

01:38.125 --> 01:40.250
'Those quivered
pulsating monster'

01:40.333 --> 01:41.834
'or whatever it is
can hardly move.'

01:41.917 --> 01:44.083
'The thing's rising up now
and the crowd falls back.'

01:44.166 --> 01:45.542
'Lord, they're
turning into flame!'

01:46.667 --> 01:47.709
'He's followed by the woods--'

01:47.792 --> 01:50.083
- Mom.
- Shh, it's alright.

01:50.166 --> 01:53.542
(male #1 on radio)
'At least 40 people,
including six state
troopers'

01:53.625 --> 01:55.417
'lie dead in a field East..'

01:55.500 --> 01:56.709
(male #2 on radio)
'Ladies and gentlemen, I have'

01:56.792 --> 01:58.834
'a grave announcement to make.'

01:58.917 --> 02:01.250

'Hello. Yes.'

02:22.917 --> 02:24.500
Oh, my God. Alright.

02:25.959 --> 02:27.041
Felton, what is it?

02:27.125 --> 02:29.417
That was Mrs. Brown next door.

02:29.500 --> 02:31.542
The Martians are
only a mile away.

02:31.625 --> 02:32.667
- We have to go.
- But--

02:32.750 --> 02:34.709
Dobber, get your coat.

02:34.792 --> 02:36.542
- Where are the car keys?
- In your pocket.

02:36.625 --> 02:38.458
(female #1)
'We need to pack up our bags.'

02:38.542 --> 02:41.208
Where's Loki?
We can't leave Loki behind!

02:41.291 --> 02:42.834
- Your dog will be fine.
- I'll get him.

02:42.917 --> 02:44.709
- But, Audrey--
- He's just in the backyard.

02:44.792 --> 02:46.166
I will be right back.

02:47.792 --> 02:50.083
Get Dobber's things,
Felton. I'll be right back.

02:51.583 --> 02:54.208
(male #4)
'Extra! Extra!
Read all about it.'

02:54.291 --> 02:56.834
'Martians take Audrey Metz.'

03:01.166 --> 03:03.166
'Thank you, sir.'

03:35.375 --> 03:36.959
Can you at least tell us
if the police will be

03:37.041 --> 03:38.208
'issuing a statement?'

03:40.625 --> 03:43.083
Those yo-yos are up early.

03:43.166 --> 03:44.917
We find Hoffa
in this hole, boss?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.625
Not quite.
Deceased female.

03:47.709 --> 03:50.250
- 'Broken hyoid bone.'
- Strangled.

03:50.333 --> 03:51.500
ME says the remains
have been down there

03:51.583 --> 03:52.792
for at least 50 years.

03:52.875 --> 03:55.125
- It's an old well.
- Clever dump site.

03:55.208 --> 03:58.917
Coins in her purse are
all dated from the '30s.

03:59.000 --> 04:00.166
(Lilly)
Hmm.

04:02.500 --> 04:04.792
"A.W.M." Her initials?

04:04.875 --> 04:07.208
I ran them against all
the missing persons records

04:07.291 --> 04:08.667
from the '30s.

04:08.750 --> 04:10.500
You two believe in Martians?

04:11.875 --> 04:14.542
Is this that woman that
disappeared in the '30s?

04:14.625 --> 04:16.041
Audrey W. Metz.

04:16.125 --> 04:18.500
- It was the end of the world.
- And my grandmother was eight.

04:18.583 --> 04:20.291
Said she had nightmares
for over a year.

04:20.375 --> 04:21.834
What the hell you
guys talking
about?

04:21.917 --> 04:24.250
October 30, 1938, Scotty.

04:24.333 --> 04:26.542
Orson Welles did
a radio broadcast

04:26.625 --> 04:28.041
of "The War of the Worlds."

04:28.125 --> 04:30.333
Only he made it seem
like it was a news report.

04:30.417 --> 04:31.583
People believed it.

04:31.667 --> 04:33.500
Millions thought
the Martians were invading.

04:33.583 --> 04:35.208
Mass panic
across the country.

04:35.291 --> 04:37.709
And Audrey
disappeared that night.

04:38.583 --> 04:40.041
And the legend began.

04:40.125 --> 04:42.625
A lot of crazy rumors
of what happened like, uh..

04:42.709 --> 04:44.667
...Martians really did take her.

04:44.750 --> 04:46.375
Or the Germans.

04:46.458 --> 04:48.500
There were Audrey Metz
sightings for the next 20
years.

04:48.583 --> 04:51.333
Like, someone saw her
scuba diving in Jamaica.

04:51.417 --> 04:53.000
Or working as a spy in Berlin.

04:53.083 --> 04:55.083
People got way too much
time on their hands.

04:55.166 --> 04:58.542
Everyone thought Audrey
traveled far and wide,
but..

05:00.041 --> 05:01.792
...she never made
it out of Philly.

05:37.792 --> 05:39.709
(Nick)
'I still can't believe
it.'

05:39.792 --> 05:41.250
Martians?

05:41.333 --> 05:43.291
Didn't anybody know
this was a prank?

05:43.375 --> 05:45.625
The power of radio
in those days, Nick.

05:45.709 --> 05:47.875
It was the only
live news source.

05:47.959 --> 05:49.750
Back when the news
wasn't all about the
latest

05:49.834 --> 05:52.375
starlet's drunk driving bust.

05:52.458 --> 05:54.417
"My wife and I heard it
come over the car radio.

05:54.500 --> 05:55.917
"All we could think
of was to get back home

05:56.000 --> 05:58.917
to see our children
before the final attack."

05:59.000 --> 06:00.709
"Well, churches
around the country held

06:00.792 --> 06:02.917
end-of-the-world
prayer meetings."

06:03.000 --> 06:04.792
(Nick)
'One guy heard
the news post-shower'

06:04.875 --> 06:07.250
drove all night from
New York to Florida

06:07.333 --> 06:09.083
<i>fiance.</i>

06:09.166 --> 06:12.625
Suddenly, everything precious
in life became crystal-clear.

06:12.709 --> 06:16.834
Yeah. Who do you want to
be with when the world ends?

06:16.917 --> 06:19.041
I wanna be with the guy
that knows it's a hoax.

06:20.542 --> 06:23.166
Audrey was
a 33-year-old housewife

06:23.250 --> 06:26.625
with a husband, Felton, and
an eight-year-old son, Robert.

06:26.709 --> 06:28.166
"Family was packing to go.

06:28.250 --> 06:31.542
She went out back to get
their dog, never returned."

06:31.625 --> 06:32.959
"Cops had no leads.

06:33.041 --> 06:34.625
It was like she
vanished into thin air."

06:34.709 --> 06:37.333
Torn movie ticket
found in Audrey's
purse.

06:37.417 --> 06:40.667
Country's panicking,
Audrey hits the
movies?

06:40.750 --> 06:42.208
Maybe the usher did it.

06:42.291 --> 06:44.709
There's handwriting
on the back.

06:44.792 --> 06:46.500
(Lilly)
'"A-Y-S."'

06:46.583 --> 06:47.709
More initials?

06:47.792 --> 06:49.458
Or the second half of a word.

06:49.542 --> 06:51.834
Maybe part of
an address she wrote down.

06:51.917 --> 06:54.041
Nick, you and Miller
check St. Luke's Hospital.

06:54.125 --> 06:57.083
Elmer Gibbins, witness from
back in the day, keeps
calling.

06:57.166 --> 06:59.667
'Says he knows who did it.'

06:59.750 --> 07:02.000
Elmer the same guy
that saw her in Germany?

07:02.083 --> 07:03.667
(John)
'Got to start someplace.'

07:03.750 --> 07:06.667
Meanwhile, let's meet with any
of the family still in town.

07:14.166 --> 07:16.166
When I was little,
I liked to think all those

07:16.250 --> 07:18.000
rumors about my mom were true.

07:18.083 --> 07:19.875
Living on an
exotic
island somewhere.

07:19.959 --> 07:22.125
She used to read
adventure stories to me.

07:22.208 --> 07:25.625
I always hoped she was
off on one of her own.

07:25.709 --> 07:27.500
Anyway, that's what
I had to believe.

07:27.583 --> 07:29.709
You notice anything
different about her behavior

07:29.792 --> 07:31.792
before she disappeared?

07:33.417 --> 07:35.375
My mom was very happy.

07:37.291 --> 07:40.000
Week before she vanished.

07:40.083 --> 07:43.041
That
a...Hudson,
Mr. Metz?

07:43.125 --> 07:45.166
Yep. 1930 model.

07:45.250 --> 07:48.917
Saw one of those at a
classic
car show few years back.

07:49.000 --> 07:51.000
Guy was asking
40 grand for
it.

07:51.083 --> 07:54.750
Think ours cost $600.
Lot of money in the
Depression.

07:54.834 --> 07:57.792
Especially with your dad
out of work for three
years.

07:59.417 --> 08:01.208
Put a strain on their marriage?

08:01.291 --> 08:03.917
Of course. But they
loved each other.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.041
Well, sometimes
that's not
enough.

08:06.125 --> 08:08.667
Maybe...she chose
that night to
split.

08:08.750 --> 08:11.250
My mom would never abandon me.

08:14.583 --> 08:16.917
Dad, why were we always
so mad at the Indians?

08:17.000 --> 08:18.208
Weren't they here first?

08:18.291 --> 08:20.000
Aud, have you seen my glasses?

08:20.083 --> 08:21.917
Come on, Dobber. No strange
questions at the table.

08:22.000 --> 08:25.125
Put the book away,
Sitting Bull. It's time to
eat.

08:25.208 --> 08:27.208
[sighs]
Soup again?

08:27.291 --> 08:28.709
Stop complaining, son.

08:28.792 --> 08:30.667
(Robert)
'But it doesn't
make me full, dad.'

08:30.750 --> 08:32.750
I get tummy aches at night.

08:34.208 --> 08:35.792
Have my bread, sweetie.

08:39.583 --> 08:41.709
Work picking up?

08:41.792 --> 08:43.375
Any day now.

08:45.667 --> 08:47.792
Well, in the meantime..

08:47.875 --> 08:49.917
...we have bills to pay.

08:51.875 --> 08:53.291
Winter's coming.
We can't afford the
gas--

08:53.375 --> 08:55.083
Dobber, fetch
me some water.

09:01.709 --> 09:04.125
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

09:04.208 --> 09:06.417
We do not discuss these
things in front of Dobber.

09:06.500 --> 09:09.959
[sighs]
When will we discuss
them?

09:10.041 --> 09:13.625
- We're in trouble, Felton.
- Things will pick up.

09:13.709 --> 09:15.792
You can't keep
putting
on a suit and tie

09:15.875 --> 09:17.250
and going to
an empty
office.

09:17.333 --> 09:21.125
- It's my job.
- We're down to pennies,
Felton.

09:21.208 --> 09:25.792
Maybe...it's time you
found other work. The
WPA--

09:25.875 --> 09:27.959
The WPA will have
me digging ditches.

09:28.041 --> 09:32.458
If it means putting food in
Dobber's stomach, so be it.

09:32.542 --> 09:35.125
[sighs]
For the love of God,
Felton
the boy's wasting away.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.000
(Felton)
'I will not become a pampered'

09:37.083 --> 09:38.792
poverty rat.

09:38.875 --> 09:41.000
- What will the neighbors
think?
- Who cares what they think?

09:41.083 --> 09:43.458
- This is your son.
- I have a reputation!

09:43.542 --> 09:46.083
You think the neighbors
care about reputations?

09:46.166 --> 09:47.583
Like Ralph Bodine who put

09:47.667 --> 09:49.375
a bullet in his head when
the stock market crashed?

09:49.458 --> 09:51.333
Or Ruth Cayler?
I saw her selling
apples--

09:51.417 --> 09:53.375
Pass the salt, please.

10:07.041 --> 10:09.792
Sounds like
the marriage was
strained.

10:09.875 --> 10:12.834
It was just
the Depression talking.

10:12.917 --> 10:14.917
Their fights ever escalate?

10:16.667 --> 10:19.000
I was with my dad that night.

10:19.083 --> 10:21.500
We drove around looking
for mom until sunrise.

10:21.583 --> 10:24.542
I understand your dad
lives here with you.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.041
Yes.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.750
He's not well.

10:27.834 --> 10:28.959
Alzheimer's.

10:31.625 --> 10:34.083
Any way we could talk to him?

10:34.166 --> 10:35.917
You're welcome to try.

10:43.750 --> 10:44.959
Hello, Aud.

10:46.208 --> 10:48.000
Have you seen my glasses?

10:49.542 --> 10:50.458
Mr. Metz..

10:50.542 --> 10:53.458
You look beautiful
this morning.

10:53.542 --> 10:55.375
I'm-I'm Detective Lilly Rush

10:55.458 --> 10:58.000
and this is my
partner, Scotty
Valens.

10:58.083 --> 11:00.458
(Scotty)
We'd like to talk
to you about the night

11:00.542 --> 11:02.375
your wife disappeared.

11:03.250 --> 11:05.208
What time's supper?

11:07.166 --> 11:09.834
Uh, Mr. Metz..

11:09.917 --> 11:11.625
...do you remember the, uh

11:11.709 --> 11:13.500
"War of the Worlds" broadcast?

11:13.583 --> 11:15.417
The Martians on the radio.

11:15.500 --> 11:18.166
Uh, yeah, the
Martians.
Remember that?

11:18.250 --> 11:19.792
October 30th.

11:19.875 --> 11:22.875
Dobber was going to be
Frankenstein that Halloween.

11:24.375 --> 11:25.375
That's right.

11:25.458 --> 11:29.041
We searched...all
night for Audrey.

11:31.083 --> 11:32.792
Then I got the news.

11:45.291 --> 11:47.250
(man on radio)
'This just in,
we can now confirm'

11:47.333 --> 11:50.542
'the Martian landing
was a hoax, a radio show.'

11:50.625 --> 11:53.709
'The governor has issued
a statement. It's all a
hoax.'

11:55.583 --> 11:58.417
We really thought it
was the end of the world.

11:59.834 --> 12:03.333
Orson Welles,
what a son of a bitch.

12:07.542 --> 12:08.834
Hello, Aud.

12:10.041 --> 12:12.000
Have you seen my glasses?

12:13.875 --> 12:17.458
Elmer Gibbins. Just had
hip replacement surgery.

12:17.542 --> 12:19.208
Claims he saw Audrey
back in the day.

12:19.291 --> 12:21.208
Doing what?
Scuba diving?

12:22.667 --> 12:24.709
Well, well.

12:24.792 --> 12:26.625
- How you doing, neighbor?
- Hey, Toni.

12:26.709 --> 12:28.208
You remember Kat Miller.

12:28.291 --> 12:29.166
Hi.

12:29.250 --> 12:30.917
Nice to see you again.

12:32.875 --> 12:34.750
I'll be down the hall.

12:34.834 --> 12:36.834
Sure.

12:36.917 --> 12:38.834
Uh, interviewing a witness.

12:39.417 --> 12:40.625
Right.

12:42.083 --> 12:43.333
Well, don't let me keep you.

12:43.417 --> 12:46.417
No. I, uh, I got a sec.

12:46.500 --> 12:48.542
- How you been?
- Good.

12:49.750 --> 12:52.083
Don't see you much
around the building.

12:52.166 --> 12:53.250
Busy.

12:53.333 --> 12:55.875
People keep
killing
each other, so..

12:55.959 --> 12:57.625
- You?
- Same.

12:57.709 --> 12:59.542
People keep getting sick.

12:59.625 --> 13:00.875
Never changes.

13:00.959 --> 13:02.583
Nothing ever does.

13:05.750 --> 13:08.417
Well...it was good
to see you, Nick.

13:09.083 --> 13:10.500
You too.

13:10.583 --> 13:12.667
Take care of yourself.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.041
Yeah.

13:33.542 --> 13:36.208
I can't believe you
finally found
Audrey.

13:37.875 --> 13:40.625
- You knew her well?
- Yes, ma'am.

13:40.709 --> 13:43.250
Saw her once a week
at the 6th Street breadline.

13:43.959 --> 13:45.667
Real nice lady.

13:45.750 --> 13:47.500
Tell you, I always
thought they'd be

13:47.583 --> 13:49.959
too clever to get caught.

13:50.041 --> 13:51.709
"They?"

13:51.792 --> 13:54.458
The FBI, dipstick.

13:54.542 --> 13:55.750
Don't you get it?

13:55.834 --> 13:58.417
Audrey knew
the invasion was
coming.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.375
The store should've
opened an hour ago.

14:11.458 --> 14:14.083
All we got is time, Audrey.

14:14.166 --> 14:16.250
Waiting is as close
as I got to a purpose.

14:16.333 --> 14:18.375
I got to get
home.
Dobber's sick.

14:18.458 --> 14:19.750
Again?

14:19.834 --> 14:22.250
Is he getting
any meat or fruit?

14:22.333 --> 14:25.375
Only when he dreams about it.

14:25.458 --> 14:27.333
The best part of my day
used to be waking him
up.

14:27.417 --> 14:30.834
I swear, he used to
sleep with a smile.

14:30.917 --> 14:32.917
He'd always have a joke or..

14:33.000 --> 14:35.458
...a funny dream to
tell
me about when he woke.

14:37.208 --> 14:38.375
Now..

14:41.542 --> 14:43.083
...I like to let him sleep in.

14:43.166 --> 14:45.709
Good afternoon, ma'am.

14:45.792 --> 14:47.625
If I may be so bold..

14:47.709 --> 14:50.500
You're too beautiful
for this much sorrow.

14:50.583 --> 14:51.750
I..

14:53.709 --> 14:54.667
Thank you.

14:54.750 --> 14:57.542
Come to 5th and Diamond.

14:57.625 --> 14:59.709
Yours will be
the prettiest
taxi.

15:01.208 --> 15:02.750
I don't understand.

15:03.875 --> 15:06.792
Rest assured, I
only
pick a chosen few.

15:11.208 --> 15:13.083
Good day.

15:20.417 --> 15:22.917
"Prettiest taxi?"

15:23.000 --> 15:24.166
Any idea what that meant?

15:24.250 --> 15:26.750
Some kind of government code.

15:26.834 --> 15:28.542
FBI.

15:28.625 --> 15:30.917
This man said he
was with the FBI?

15:31.000 --> 15:32.458
Of course he
didn't say it.

15:32.542 --> 15:36.166
He was an undercover
agent, not a moron.

15:36.250 --> 15:37.667
Is this guy new?

15:37.750 --> 15:39.000
Total rookie.

15:39.083 --> 15:40.667
Figures.

15:40.750 --> 15:43.875
You see, Audrey
was picked
special.

15:43.959 --> 15:47.125
The FBI knew that
the Martians were
coming.

15:47.208 --> 15:51.500
But the Martians got to
her before she could
run.

15:51.583 --> 15:55.208
Then, the FBI covered it over.

15:56.250 --> 15:58.166
Right.

15:58.250 --> 16:00.500
Is the boss
punishing
us for something?

16:00.583 --> 16:02.709
Told you not to steal
his paper clips.

16:06.875 --> 16:08.875
Miss her?

16:08.959 --> 16:10.792
Don't even think about it.

16:10.875 --> 16:12.959
Expect me to
believe that, dipstick?

16:22.792 --> 16:24.041
(Will)
'Oh, here's a good one.'

16:24.125 --> 16:25.375
Lady said, "I saw Audrey

16:25.458 --> 16:27.542
jogging with Hitler
in Fairmount Park."

16:27.625 --> 16:30.125
Let me guess, she's alive
and wants to make a statement.

16:30.208 --> 16:31.667
Called ten minutes ago.

16:31.750 --> 16:34.875
How about a dance, boss?
Ten cents gets you one song.

16:34.959 --> 16:36.667
Oh, this better be good.

16:36.750 --> 16:39.667
That guy told Audrey to meet
him at 5th and Diamond, right?

16:39.750 --> 16:42.542
Used to be where the
Palomar Ballroom was in 1938.

16:42.625 --> 16:44.959
- Palomar Ballroom? What's
that?
- Dance hall.

16:45.041 --> 16:47.500
Lot of young women worked
there as taxi dancers.

16:47.583 --> 16:50.291
I talked to the guy who
runs it now, real history
buff.

16:50.375 --> 16:52.792
'That's not a movie ticket.'

16:52.875 --> 16:54.208
It's a dance ticket.

16:54.291 --> 16:55.834
- For a dime-a-dance girl.
- Mm-hmm.

16:55.917 --> 16:57.583
(Will)
'That's right, men
would pay for dances'

16:57.667 --> 17:00.208
would last the amount you
paid, like a taxi ride.

17:00.291 --> 17:03.583
Yeah. G-rated
version of a lap dance.

17:03.667 --> 17:06.417
Guy who managed it
was named Buzz Moran.

17:06.500 --> 17:08.166
He died in 1972.

17:08.250 --> 17:10.667
So, this Buzz was
recruiting Audrey.

17:10.750 --> 17:13.291
And that ticket
says she took the job.

17:13.375 --> 17:15.583
Opens a whole new
world of suspects.

17:15.667 --> 17:19.166
Yeah. My money says
her killer was a client.

17:23.458 --> 17:25.875
The Palomar Ballroom.

17:25.959 --> 17:30.792
My, oh, my, that feels
like a hundred years
ago.

17:32.041 --> 17:34.041
How did you find me?

17:34.125 --> 17:37.083
Uh, the Palomar has
photos from your
day.

17:37.166 --> 17:38.250
Oh.

17:38.333 --> 17:40.166
You're the only
one we found, Penny.

17:40.250 --> 17:43.458
[chuckles]
You mean, I'm
the only one still alive.

17:43.542 --> 17:45.500
'Oh, I'll be gosh-darned.'

17:45.583 --> 17:48.500
Now, who could
imagine being that young?

17:48.583 --> 17:51.458
We're investigating
the murder of Audrey Metz.

17:51.542 --> 17:53.625
We think she was a dancer there.

17:53.709 --> 17:56.750
Audrey. I read
about it in the papers.

17:56.834 --> 17:58.000
You knew her at the club?

17:58.083 --> 17:59.875
Oh, you betcha, by golly.

17:59.959 --> 18:01.625
We got to be very close.

18:01.709 --> 18:04.291
But she don't seem to fit
the profile of a dancer.

18:04.375 --> 18:06.125
(Penny)
Oh, true.

18:06.208 --> 18:08.458
Most of us were
working-class girls who wanted

18:08.542 --> 18:11.333
to dance professionally
or be in the movies.

18:11.417 --> 18:13.834
- Not many moms?
- Oh, gosh, no.

18:13.917 --> 18:17.000
I heard stories about
the Palomar in those days.

18:17.083 --> 18:19.667
Cops were called in to break
up a lot of fights, and..

18:19.750 --> 18:22.583
It could be
a rough-and-tumble place.

18:22.667 --> 18:25.500
It attracted a lot
of dangerous types.

18:25.583 --> 18:26.875
How'd Audrey handle it?

18:26.959 --> 18:29.375
Different class of gal.

18:29.458 --> 18:31.834
Had trouble with
the tough customers.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.834
Have a pleasant evening.

18:42.083 --> 18:43.750
After you.

19:21.375 --> 19:23.709
You must be Audrey.
I'm Penny.

19:23.792 --> 19:25.041
Oh, you're gonna love it here.

19:25.125 --> 19:26.667
Oh, well, this
is just
temporary.

19:26.750 --> 19:28.875
Till my family
gets
back on its
feet.

19:29.834 --> 19:32.250
Do we just...stand and wait?

19:32.333 --> 19:35.333
[chuckles]
You don't wait. You advertise.

19:35.417 --> 19:36.542
Oh.

19:41.166 --> 19:44.125
What if they touch you
where they're not invited?

19:44.208 --> 19:47.417
Oh, don't worry. Most of
these guys are Okay Joes.

19:47.500 --> 19:50.041
fiance

19:50.125 --> 19:51.750
There he is now.

19:57.250 --> 19:59.583
The thing is,
times ain't that bad.

19:59.667 --> 20:01.417
There's good if you
know where to look.

20:01.500 --> 20:03.792
- You think so?
- You betcha, by golly.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.625
(Buzz)
'Now the band's gonna
play a slow one for you.'

20:11.709 --> 20:13.959
This is called "Always."

20:17.250 --> 20:19.291
(male #5)
'How you doing, toots?'

20:44.542 --> 20:46.125
Ticket doesn't
pay for that, sailor.

20:46.208 --> 20:48.291
(male #5)
Yeah. What does?

20:48.375 --> 20:51.542
How about two sawbucks,
you polish my golf
shaft?

20:51.625 --> 20:54.041
- Go to hell.
- 'Hey, relax.'

20:54.125 --> 20:56.834
Let me buy you some giggle
water. Warm you up a bit.

20:58.000 --> 20:59.250
Why don't you
take a rest,
pal?

20:59.333 --> 21:00.500
The lady seems tired.

21:00.583 --> 21:02.041
Why don't you
mind your beeswax?

21:03.834 --> 21:06.625
You drunk, stupid or both?

21:06.709 --> 21:08.709
You wanna talk outside, buster?

21:15.375 --> 21:16.750
Sorry, my mistake.

21:21.417 --> 21:22.792
Thank you.

21:41.458 --> 21:45.333
The owner, Buzz, gave
a talking to that sailor.

21:45.417 --> 21:47.417
He shipped out
the next day anyway.

21:47.500 --> 21:50.667
So, uh, who was this
knight in shining armor?

21:50.750 --> 21:53.125
Will Paige.

21:53.208 --> 21:57.458
He'd sit in the dark
and stare at Audrey

21:57.542 --> 22:00.041
'night after night.'

22:00.125 --> 22:02.375
He was this lonesome, rich guy

22:02.458 --> 22:04.375
with nothing to lose, and..

22:05.917 --> 22:07.750
...he gave me
the heebie-jeebies.

22:07.834 --> 22:10.458
You thinking Will
might've hurt her?

22:10.542 --> 22:12.166
(Penny)
'He was awful violent.'

22:12.250 --> 22:14.375
Rumor was he quit the booze

22:14.458 --> 22:18.417
'cause he got in a drunken
fight and he killed a guy.

22:30.166 --> 22:32.166
Mr. Paige?

22:32.250 --> 22:34.291
Detective Rush and Vera.

22:34.375 --> 22:36.041
We're investigating the murder..

22:36.125 --> 22:37.417
...of Audrey Metz.

22:37.500 --> 22:38.750
Checked your record.

22:38.834 --> 22:41.083
Three drunk
and disorderlies back
then.

22:41.166 --> 22:42.333
You sent a man to the hospital

22:42.417 --> 22:44.250
with your fists,
almost killed
him.

22:44.333 --> 22:45.792
Glad I stopped drinking.

22:45.875 --> 22:47.667
Got a witness says
you were stalking her

22:47.750 --> 22:49.375
at the Palomar Ballroom.

22:49.458 --> 22:51.250
Rich man with too much
time on his hands?

22:51.333 --> 22:53.625
How'd you make out so
well during the Depression?

22:53.709 --> 22:56.917
I was an inventor.
Already retired.

22:57.041 --> 22:58.417
Sounds like you
were just another
guy

22:58.500 --> 23:00.500
out to buy a piece of tail.

23:01.500 --> 23:02.959
You get rough with her?

23:04.083 --> 23:06.375
Audrey wasn't like
the other girls.

23:08.208 --> 23:10.250
Every night I bought
up all her tickets.

23:11.542 --> 23:13.250
That's a lot of dancing.

23:15.041 --> 23:16.458
Oh, we never danced.

23:22.750 --> 23:24.542
My wife is desperately ill.

23:24.625 --> 23:25.959
Hospitalized.

23:26.041 --> 23:28.250
I found a strength
I never knew I had.

23:30.041 --> 23:32.083
I did everything
I could to help
her.

23:33.166 --> 23:35.041
But then one day..

23:37.041 --> 23:38.166
You lost her.

23:42.917 --> 23:45.166
Yeah, I lost her.

23:45.250 --> 23:48.000
It's like life is
just about survival.

23:48.083 --> 23:50.458
Like, love has..

23:50.542 --> 23:52.500
...fled forever.

23:52.583 --> 23:55.375
You can't even see it
in people's eyes anymore.

23:55.458 --> 23:57.583
You mean, you and your husband?

24:00.917 --> 24:04.166
I truly loved him once, but..

24:04.250 --> 24:06.625
...since things got so bad..

24:06.709 --> 24:08.834
...I don't know him anymore.

24:08.917 --> 24:11.500
- You think he's changed?
- No.

24:12.750 --> 24:15.250
What I fear is this
is who he's always been.

24:16.709 --> 24:18.959
Or you're the one who's changed.

24:19.041 --> 24:20.667
Maybe I have.

24:22.959 --> 24:25.542
I know I'd do anything
to protect my son.

24:28.250 --> 24:31.375
Maybe I've found the strength
that I never knew I had.

24:31.458 --> 24:33.333
You were awful
tough
with that sailor.

24:33.417 --> 24:34.875
Ah, I was afraid.

24:34.959 --> 24:36.458
You were brave.

24:36.542 --> 24:39.417
I was thinking, "There's
someone who can hold her own."

24:39.500 --> 24:40.792
I was also
thinking
how big he was

24:40.875 --> 24:42.375
hoping you'd
take
the first shot.

24:44.792 --> 24:45.875
Oh!

24:47.750 --> 24:49.333
I forgot about that.

24:49.417 --> 24:51.458
What?

24:51.542 --> 24:52.834
Laughing.

24:57.375 --> 24:59.417
Maybe one night
we should dance.

25:02.875 --> 25:04.166
Maybe.

25:07.500 --> 25:08.792
I should..

25:08.875 --> 25:10.917
...get back out on the floor.

25:20.792 --> 25:21.959
Audrey.

25:23.875 --> 25:25.709
You're a damn disgrace.

25:30.500 --> 25:33.083
Sounds like her
husband
was a little jealous.

25:33.166 --> 25:34.542
He never saw me.

25:34.625 --> 25:37.083
'Besides, there was
nothing to be jealous about.'

25:37.166 --> 25:38.875
I was still in
love with a ghost.

25:38.959 --> 25:40.375
Felton didn't know
about her dancing?

25:40.458 --> 25:43.250
Middle class housewife
becoming a taxi dancer?

25:44.375 --> 25:45.667
Scandalous.

25:45.750 --> 25:47.917
Tough for an ego
like that to
take.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.083
(Will)
'I suppose.'

25:49.166 --> 25:50.667
I never saw her again.

25:50.750 --> 25:52.125
Maybe murder was
the only way to get her

25:52.208 --> 25:54.166
to hang up her dancing shoes.

25:58.417 --> 25:59.875
This is absurd. I told you.

25:59.959 --> 26:01.875
I was with my dad
the whole night.

26:01.959 --> 26:04.125
Your mom was a taxi dancer.

26:04.208 --> 26:05.834
He found out.

26:05.917 --> 26:06.875
You knew.

26:06.959 --> 26:08.333
Might've mentioned that to us.

26:08.417 --> 26:10.125
Hasn't there been
enough speculation

26:10.208 --> 26:12.291
and rumor about my mom?

26:12.375 --> 26:13.750
Can't you let
her rest in
peace?

26:13.834 --> 26:15.625
We just want to find
out what happened.

26:15.709 --> 26:19.083
What happened is my mom was
trying to feed our family.

26:20.375 --> 26:22.625
She sacrificed
everything for
me.

26:22.709 --> 26:26.291
Yeah, but your dad couldn't
handle what she was doing.

26:26.375 --> 26:30.041
No. They came to
an understanding.

26:33.750 --> 26:36.041
(Felton)
'I told you, Audrey. You will
not go back to that place.'

26:36.125 --> 26:37.959
(Audrey)
'What do we have to show
for these past two weeks?'

26:38.041 --> 26:40.709
We don't have food
to put on the table
<i>again.</i>

26:40.792 --> 26:42.709
At least I can walk
down the street without

26:42.792 --> 26:44.417
people thinking
that my wife is a..

26:44.500 --> 26:46.083
People can think
what they want.

26:46.166 --> 26:49.000
I applied for a shipping
job at the Piper factory.

26:50.500 --> 26:51.834
They said I wasn't
qualified enough.

26:51.917 --> 26:54.208
My God, I've got
a degree from Dartmouth.

26:54.291 --> 26:56.542
Then we don't have a choice.

26:56.625 --> 26:58.709
Then I have to go back.

27:00.667 --> 27:02.500
It'll be our secret.

27:02.583 --> 27:05.291
You needn't be
ashamed of me,
Felton.

27:09.834 --> 27:13.333
Do you remember when
Dobber turned four?

27:13.417 --> 27:15.417
That blizzard
we got caught in?

27:15.500 --> 27:18.041
I had to push the car
out of the snowbank.

27:19.208 --> 27:21.208
You called me your hero.

27:28.542 --> 27:29.875
You still are.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.875
(Penny)
'Tell your mom Penny's here.'

27:49.000 --> 27:51.208
Tell her the good's gone, kid.

27:55.625 --> 27:56.917
- Penny?
- Yeah.

27:57.000 --> 27:59.083
My mom had to take
her to the hospital.

27:59.166 --> 28:01.291
She had bruises
on her neck?

28:04.792 --> 28:07.083
Like she was choked.

28:07.166 --> 28:09.291
The same way Audrey died.

28:11.500 --> 28:14.917
You married Crick in, uh, 1939.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.667
Yes, we had 15
wonderful
years.

28:18.750 --> 28:20.625
Well, then,
the cancer got
him.

28:20.709 --> 28:22.417
You were Crick's second wife.

28:22.500 --> 28:24.250
In the divorce records,
his first wife said

28:24.333 --> 28:26.250
he was physically abusive.

28:26.333 --> 28:27.917
Well, that's not my business.

28:28.000 --> 28:29.166
(John)
'Penny, we talked to Dobber.'

28:29.250 --> 28:31.375
Said you showed up
at their house.

28:31.458 --> 28:33.667
Said you had
bruises on your neck.

28:36.417 --> 28:39.208
I wanted to
believe
people were good.

28:39.291 --> 28:41.500
- But I was wrong.
- What do you mean?

28:41.583 --> 28:43.667
Crick wanted me
to sell myself.

28:43.750 --> 28:47.125
- I-I said, no, and..
- He beat you?

28:48.542 --> 28:50.291
Maybe he did the same to Audrey.

28:50.375 --> 28:53.208
If anyone is to blame..

28:53.291 --> 28:54.792
...it's me.

28:54.875 --> 28:57.333
- You?
- I went to Audrey for help.

28:57.417 --> 29:00.417
I was so upset
that night, I
just..

29:02.542 --> 29:03.542
What is it, Penny?

29:05.083 --> 29:08.208
I was jealous
of her and
Will.

29:08.291 --> 29:10.333
I had to prove to Audrey

29:10.417 --> 29:13.834
that the world
was a bad
place.

29:13.917 --> 29:15.291
What'd you do?

29:15.375 --> 29:18.792
I told her
Will Paige's real
secret.

29:25.083 --> 29:27.959
You sure you're
feeling better?

29:28.041 --> 29:29.834
You betcha, by golly.

29:30.500 --> 29:32.500
Hello.

29:32.583 --> 29:36.000
Hi, Will. Look, Buzz says
I have to take other
tickets.

29:36.083 --> 29:38.750
- I can't..
- Just give me a minute.

29:38.834 --> 29:40.625
I need to talk.

29:46.291 --> 29:48.000
Where were you?
I was worried.

29:48.083 --> 29:50.125
I'm fine. I can
take care of
myself.

29:54.458 --> 29:57.792
I bought a
special
ticket tonight.

29:57.875 --> 30:00.250
The song that was
playing
when I first saw you.

30:01.917 --> 30:03.709
It's how long
this ticket
lasts.

30:05.792 --> 30:08.083
"Always."

30:08.166 --> 30:10.333
Before I met you,
I thought anything
good

30:10.417 --> 30:13.166
in my world
was gone
forever.

30:13.250 --> 30:16.417
I started believing
people
that said life was just
cruel.

30:18.125 --> 30:20.542
And then I met you.

30:20.625 --> 30:22.500
Love hasn't gone anywhere.

30:22.583 --> 30:25.417
It's right here in front of us.

30:25.500 --> 30:27.583
The cruel thing
would be to ignore
it.

30:29.625 --> 30:32.333
Will, I can't leave my son.
He's all I have.

30:32.417 --> 30:34.458
I'll help take
care of Dobber.

30:35.291 --> 30:37.583
Whatever it takes.

30:37.667 --> 30:39.291
I can't.

30:40.166 --> 30:42.083
Because of your husband?

30:42.166 --> 30:43.792
Because of your wife.

30:46.166 --> 30:47.709
I know she's alive, Will.

30:47.792 --> 30:49.834
You're still married.

30:53.000 --> 30:55.625
I thought you were the kind
of man who faced the truth.

30:55.709 --> 30:57.667
At least my
husband doesn't lie.

31:01.875 --> 31:03.500
You're the cruelest
of them all.

31:05.166 --> 31:06.333
Audrey.

31:14.834 --> 31:16.709
Shot of rye, Mickey.

31:16.792 --> 31:18.250
Mr. Paige, you never drink.

31:18.333 --> 31:20.208
To hell with never.

31:22.041 --> 31:23.083
To hell with her.

31:40.250 --> 31:42.792
Are you sure the word
"Always" was on the ticket?

31:42.875 --> 31:45.250
Oh, yes. Positive.

31:46.834 --> 31:49.792
The same ticket that
ended up with Audrey's body.

31:49.875 --> 31:51.792
Will saw her again.

31:51.875 --> 31:54.875
Yeah. At the end
of the world.

31:58.208 --> 31:59.500
(Nick)
'Seems like you've got
a selective memory, Will.'

31:59.583 --> 32:01.333
(Scotty)
You saw Audrey again.

32:01.417 --> 32:03.500
Only this time she
was on to all your lies.

32:03.583 --> 32:05.875
Telling people
your wife was dead?

32:05.959 --> 32:08.667
- That's cold.
- Don't you people understand?

32:08.750 --> 32:10.375
She might as well have been.

32:10.458 --> 32:14.458
She was institutionalized
for three years.

32:16.000 --> 32:18.208
Back then they
called it mood swings.

32:18.291 --> 32:19.417
She was bipolar?

32:19.500 --> 32:21.000
(Will)
'What difference is the name?'

32:21.083 --> 32:25.834
The stigma of mental illness
in those days was worse than
TB.

32:25.917 --> 32:27.500
She never got better?

32:27.583 --> 32:30.667
There was a terrific
new treatment..

32:30.750 --> 32:32.959
...called a lobotomy.

32:33.041 --> 32:35.041
Left her good as dead.

32:35.125 --> 32:36.583
Both of us.

32:36.667 --> 32:38.792
'I sat in the dark
for three years.'

32:40.750 --> 32:43.166
And then, Audrey walked in.

32:43.250 --> 32:45.834
That was real romantic, homes.

32:45.917 --> 32:47.834
One problem.

32:47.917 --> 32:49.792
You were still married.

32:49.875 --> 32:51.333
Audrey left you in the dust.

32:51.417 --> 32:53.375
Maybe you killed
her to keep her.

32:53.458 --> 32:55.041
She wasn't mine to keep.

32:55.125 --> 32:57.291
- But you found her that
night.
- 'No.'

32:58.667 --> 32:59.875
She found me.

33:01.959 --> 33:04.417
I thought I'd
lost her forever.

33:04.500 --> 33:06.625
No feeling worse than that.

33:11.542 --> 33:14.000
But things change..

33:14.083 --> 33:16.291
...when it's
the end of the world.

33:16.375 --> 33:17.750
How so?

33:18.959 --> 33:21.625
It was as if nothing
else existed but her.

33:23.542 --> 33:26.917
(male #1 on radio)
'Enemy machines have now
touched down in Washington DC.'

33:27.000 --> 33:29.125
'Early reports tell us
that over 300 are dead'

33:29.208 --> 33:30.834
'or missing in the Capitol.'

33:30.917 --> 33:32.208
'This adds
to the widespread
devastation..'

33:32.291 --> 33:33.917
Is that ticket still good?

33:34.000 --> 33:35.834
(male #1 on radio)
'...from the horrible
Martian attack.'

33:35.917 --> 33:37.834
'Thousands are fleeing West
from the frightful invaders'

33:37.917 --> 33:41.750
'from space who bring nothing
but fire and destruction..'

33:41.834 --> 33:43.500
'This announcer
cannot help but wonder..'

33:45.709 --> 33:48.750
It does say "Always."

33:53.000 --> 33:54.917
Leave with me, Audrey.
It's not too late.

33:55.000 --> 33:56.959
Oh, you know I can't.

34:00.208 --> 34:02.208
What are we going to do?

34:05.125 --> 34:06.917
Just hold me.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.208
Hold me one time
before it's over.

34:32.625 --> 34:34.875
We had that one dance
and then she left.

34:36.542 --> 34:38.750
I drove around the rest
of the night in a daze.

34:39.667 --> 34:42.000
And the Martians never came.

34:44.917 --> 34:47.333
I didn't have a radio in my car.

34:47.417 --> 34:49.625
'I didn't even know it
was a hoax till morning.'

34:52.083 --> 34:54.000
But you had that dance.

34:55.875 --> 34:59.375
If I had let that
moment slip away..

34:59.458 --> 35:01.583
...I couldn't have
lived with myself.

35:09.542 --> 35:10.625
Toni Halstea?

35:10.709 --> 35:12.166
(Nick)
She's a nurse.

35:12.250 --> 35:14.083
Toni Halstead? She's..

35:16.083 --> 35:17.291
Toni?

35:19.667 --> 35:21.458
Toni. Toni?

35:22.917 --> 35:24.125
(Nick)
'Toni.'

35:24.917 --> 35:25.834
- Hey.
- Nick?

35:25.917 --> 35:27.166
- Hi.
- What's wrong?

35:27.250 --> 35:31.125
[panting]
Nothing's wrong.
I'm on a case.

35:31.208 --> 35:32.583
Guy thought it was
the end of the world..

35:32.667 --> 35:34.291
...had to see the girl
he was in love with

35:34.375 --> 35:35.917
'and they danced to their song
and it made me think about'

35:36.000 --> 35:38.959
that Sinatra song that was
playing on our first date.

35:39.041 --> 35:39.917
Sinatra?

35:40.000 --> 35:41.375
I don't care
that you hate my job

35:41.458 --> 35:44.208
or you think we're
no good together.

35:44.291 --> 35:45.583
'I don't want to lose you.'

35:45.667 --> 35:47.709
I can't live without you.

35:47.792 --> 35:51.208
Sinatra wasn't
playing
on our first date.

35:51.291 --> 35:52.375
What?

35:52.458 --> 35:53.875
Tupac was.

35:54.834 --> 35:55.959
Tupac?

35:56.041 --> 35:57.542
Sinatra was
playing
at the restaurant

35:57.625 --> 35:58.667
on our third date.

35:58.750 --> 36:00.208
Point is..

36:02.750 --> 36:04.166
...I didn't want to wait..

36:05.166 --> 36:07.959
...until the end of the world..

36:08.041 --> 36:10.000
...to do this.

36:10.083 --> 36:11.083
Wait.

36:11.166 --> 36:12.333
Hold it.

36:13.875 --> 36:15.959
Y-y-you think you can
just
waltz in here like some

36:16.041 --> 36:19.208
crazy-assed Jerry Maguire
and we're back together?

36:19.291 --> 36:21.542
Just like that?

36:21.625 --> 36:23.750
I was kind of hoping.

36:27.083 --> 36:28.500
Don't say it.

36:30.166 --> 36:31.291
Think about it.

36:33.291 --> 36:34.458
Okay.

36:35.667 --> 36:37.417
I'll be waiting.

36:38.750 --> 36:40.875
I'll be waiting!

36:46.375 --> 36:50.041
(Scotty)
I was talking to this, uh,
guy.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.667
Had a car just like that.

36:51.750 --> 36:53.291
Said he didn't get
the news about the
hoax

36:53.375 --> 36:54.834
'cause he was driving all night.

36:54.917 --> 36:56.083
So?

36:56.166 --> 36:58.583
Well, cars didn't
have radios till
1932.

36:58.667 --> 37:00.875
That Hudson...didn't have one.

37:00.959 --> 37:02.375
That's a 1930 model.

37:02.458 --> 37:04.250
You came over
to talk about cars?

37:04.333 --> 37:08.959
Your father heard the news
about the hoax when he was home.

37:09.041 --> 37:11.291
You really look for
your mother till
sunrise?

37:13.166 --> 37:15.500
She came home that
night, didn't she?

37:22.125 --> 37:23.291
I..

37:25.875 --> 37:28.542
I had to believe
the world was a good place.

37:30.208 --> 37:34.166
- You saw her?
- No, but I heard her come
home.

37:34.250 --> 37:35.959
I was..

37:36.041 --> 37:38.583
...I was in bed,
falling asleep.

37:40.834 --> 37:42.875
The next morning..

37:42.959 --> 37:45.458
...I convinced myself
it was just a dream.

37:46.750 --> 37:50.041
After a while,
I started to believe that.

37:51.041 --> 37:52.959
Better than the reality.

37:53.041 --> 37:55.709
I swear, I don't
know what happened.

38:01.834 --> 38:03.625
My dad could never..

38:09.250 --> 38:10.417
He's..

38:11.917 --> 38:14.583
He's just a sick..

38:14.667 --> 38:16.625
...old...man.

38:29.375 --> 38:31.000
Thank you, Aud.

38:32.709 --> 38:34.667
What time is supper?

38:36.417 --> 38:38.458
About 20 minutes.

38:47.875 --> 38:48.959
Felton.

38:49.041 --> 38:50.208
Yes.

38:53.333 --> 38:55.667
I can't believe
it was all a hoax.

39:00.000 --> 39:01.917
Is Dobber alright?

39:03.166 --> 39:04.792
Dobber's in bed.

39:06.875 --> 39:08.542
Where were you?

39:11.166 --> 39:13.417
- I--
- Answer me, damn it!

39:17.458 --> 39:19.417
I was at the ballroom.

39:21.125 --> 39:23.166
I was with him.

39:25.000 --> 39:26.917
I finally had
something to believe in

39:27.000 --> 39:28.834
at the end of the world.

39:30.417 --> 39:32.500
What did you have, Felton?

39:34.917 --> 39:36.083
Nothing.

39:43.542 --> 39:45.041
(Audrey)
Is everything okay?

39:45.125 --> 39:46.792
Where's Dobber?

39:46.875 --> 39:48.250
[sighs]
I looked everywhere
for the dog

39:48.333 --> 39:50.417
and I had to help Ms. Curran
start her car and..

39:50.500 --> 39:52.000
It was a hoax.

39:52.542 --> 39:53.709
What?

39:54.875 --> 39:57.875
The invasion,
it was a lie.

39:57.959 --> 40:00.208
Just like the
one
you're telling.

40:06.709 --> 40:08.834
You went to see someone.

40:11.375 --> 40:12.583
Yes.

40:14.959 --> 40:16.166
I had to.

40:16.250 --> 40:18.417
What did that place do to you?

40:20.208 --> 40:21.750
It made me strong.

40:27.917 --> 40:30.291
'I...met someone..'

40:32.333 --> 40:33.917
...who made me realize..

40:35.500 --> 40:37.709
...that I'm still alive.

40:37.792 --> 40:39.000
What about us?

40:39.083 --> 40:41.750
Our marriage died
years ago, Felton.

40:41.834 --> 40:44.583
Aren't you tired
of playing pretend?

40:44.667 --> 40:47.291
I just want the
girl
that I fell in love
with.

40:49.208 --> 40:51.792
That person doesn't
exist anymore.

40:51.875 --> 40:54.000
Why should you have
someone to go to?

40:54.083 --> 40:56.583
- Felton.
- Everyone was afraid tonight!

40:56.667 --> 40:59.709
Do you know what scared
me the most at the end?

41:01.208 --> 41:03.375
[crying]
I had no one to turn
to.

41:05.041 --> 41:07.083
[crying]
My world was empty.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.583
Go to bed, Felton.
You're tired.

41:10.667 --> 41:13.000
[shouting]
Don't you
tell
me what to

41:14.750 --> 41:16.250
Fix me my supper!

41:18.041 --> 41:19.625
Fix it yourself.

41:21.333 --> 41:23.750
Audrey, you will
do as you're
told.

41:23.834 --> 41:26.291
- Felton, please.
- You're my wife!

41:26.375 --> 41:28.834
You love me, damn it!

41:28.917 --> 41:30.959
I'm your hero!

41:31.041 --> 41:33.000
[shouting]
I'm your
hero!

41:33.083 --> 41:35.834
(male #1 on radio)
'In case you missed it,
folks, there are no
Martians.'

41:35.917 --> 41:38.500
'The only danger
was in our imagination.'

41:38.583 --> 41:40.959
'Now let's all relax
with some romantic music.'

41:41.041 --> 41:42.458
'Here's "Always."'
