We fought too hard and suffered too much

20:33.066 --> 20:36.361
to resign ourselves to the extinction
of our family line.

20:37.070 --> 20:41.283
I must demand that you hold true
to the deal that you agreed to.

20:42.576 --> 20:43.577
(WHIMPERS)

20:45.495 --> 20:48.081
THE MANDALORIAN:
Look, lady, the deal is off.

20:49.458 --> 20:52.461
We're lucky if we get off this frozen tomb
with our lives.

20:53.921 --> 20:57.966
FROG LADY: I thought honoring one's word
was a part of the Mandalorian code.

21:00.844 --> 21:03.514

22:45.532 --> 22:46.742
Hey, kid.

Come back here!

It's not safe out here.

We ran the tabs on the Razor Crest.

33:20.250 --> 33:21.877
You have an arrest warrant

33:21.960 --> 33:25.047
for the abduction
of prisoner X-Six-Nine-Eleven.

33:26.381 --> 33:31.595
However, onboard security records
show that you apprehended

33:31.678 --> 33:34.389
three priority culprits
from the Wanted Register.

33:35.307 --> 33:38.894
Security records also show
that you put your own life in harm's way

33:38.977 --> 33:43.148
to try to protect that of Lieutenant Davan
from the New Republic Correctional Corps.

But these are trying times.

THE MANDALORIAN: What say I forego
the bounties on these three criminals,

33:59.122 --> 34:02.167
and you two help me fuse my hull
so I can get off this frozen rock?

34:04.795 --> 34:06.505
What say you fix that transponder,

34:06.588 --> 34:09.716
and we don't vaporize that antique
the next time we patrol the Rim?

34:48.130 --> 34:53.260
All right. I'm gonna repair the cockpit
enough for us to limp to Trask.

34:54.011 --> 34:56.513
There's nothing I can do
about the main hull's integrity,

34:56.597 --> 34:58.974
so we're gonna have to get cozy
in the cockpit.

34:59.641 --> 35:01.518
It's the only thing I can pressurize.

35:02.811 --> 35:07.065
If you need to use the privy, do it now.
