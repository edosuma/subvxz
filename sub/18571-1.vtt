00:26.973 --> 00:30.204
- (knock at door)
- (man) Anita!

00:30.293 --> 00:33.126
(man chuckles)

00:33.213 --> 00:35.204
Coming.

00:39.413 --> 00:43.406
(man) I've been saving up for you
for a long time.

00:43.493 --> 00:46.007
Come on, honey!

00:50.533 --> 00:52.842
(man laughs)

00:52.933 --> 00:58.246
Come on, honey! I'm a-waiting!

00:59.653 --> 01:03.282
- Happy birthday, Colonel!
- (laughs)

01:06.133 --> 01:09.250
Oh, darlin', darlin'!

01:10.573 --> 01:14.282
All right, let's raise the flag on the flagpole!

01:14.373 --> 01:17.809
You know the rules. No side arms upstairs.

01:17.893 --> 01:20.202
Birthday kiss. Yeah.

01:20.293 --> 01:22.932
Take off your coat and stay a while.

01:24.333 --> 01:26.324
- Come on, darlin'.
- A toast.

01:26.413 --> 01:29.325
A toast? Yeah, give me a drink. Sure.

01:30.573 --> 01:35.010
- Colonel, you're such a pig!
- Yeah! Oink, oink!

01:35.093 --> 01:36.287
(laughs)

01:36.373 --> 01:39.968
- One year better.
- One year better and one year older.

01:40.053 --> 01:41.930
Mm!

01:42.013 --> 01:45.050
Now, darlin', what do you say, huh?

01:45.133 --> 01:48.967
Where's the centre of your charms?
Come on! Come on!

02:00.333 --> 02:02.403
(guffaws)

02:03.133 --> 02:05.567
I want that kiss!

02:12.293 --> 02:16.411
(band plays "Shall We Gather At The River?")

02:16.493 --> 02:18.609
Where you goin'?

02:21.533 --> 02:25.048
There they go again.
What the hell's goin' on?

02:25.133 --> 02:27.488
(singing)

02:45.093 --> 02:47.732
God-fearing citizens of this fine town,

02:47.813 --> 02:54.889
ain't it about time we stop letting
the sad morality of a pernicious few sinners

02:54.973 --> 02:56.850
bring shame upon us all?

02:56.933 --> 02:57.968
(all) Amen!

02:58.053 --> 03:02.012
Time to put a stop to the drinkin'...

03:02.093 --> 03:04.084
and the gamblin'...

03:04.173 --> 03:06.164
and the whorin'...

03:06.253 --> 03:08.562
right under our very noses!

03:08.653 --> 03:12.851
Hey, preacher, you come up here.
We think we could change your mind.

03:12.933 --> 03:16.448
(chatter and piano music)

03:24.813 --> 03:27.725
A man's entitled to a drink
every once in a while.

03:27.813 --> 03:31.886
My father, he'd have his drink on Saturday
night and work hard all week long.

03:31.973 --> 03:34.043
Nothing wrong with that.

03:34.133 --> 03:37.170
You see, it says in the Bible...

03:45.173 --> 03:47.050
Give me two cards.

03:47.133 --> 03:49.124
Two. I want two.

03:49.213 --> 03:51.681
(woman chuckles)

03:51.773 --> 03:53.889
You had two already.

03:53.973 --> 03:58.524
Hold on there! Where you goin'?
We ain't finished yet.

03:58.613 --> 04:02.891
I ain't even got my birthday kiss yet.
You gonna rob me of it?

04:02.973 --> 04:05.123
Come on, now.

04:05.213 --> 04:07.727
(laughs and whoops)

04:10.133 --> 04:12.124
It's all right. Come on.

04:18.572 --> 04:22.885
You stay away from me!
Cody! Cody! Cody!

04:22.973 --> 04:26.010
- Cody!
- Damn whore!

04:28.333 --> 04:30.847
Keep your hands off her, Colonel.

04:30.933 --> 04:35.802
I paid for a goddamn birthday kiss!
I'm gonna get one!

04:37.013 --> 04:39.607
You touch her again, you're a dead man.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.523
(gasping and shrieking)

05:01.293 --> 05:04.251
(man) She shot him!
The whore shot the colonel!

05:04.333 --> 05:07.803
Get her! Harlot! Get her!

05:07.893 --> 05:11.966
She shot the colonel!
She shot him! Get her! Get her!

05:20.253 --> 05:24.132
(singing "Onward Christian Soldiers")

05:50.933 --> 05:52.924
You OK?

05:53.933 --> 05:55.924
Ohh!

06:03.173 --> 06:06.370
The good Lord sayeth
an eye for an eye, a life for a life.

06:06.453 --> 06:09.013
Lord, let this Jezebel be damned to death!

06:09.093 --> 06:12.369
Harlot, you cannot escape
the wrath of our Lord.

06:12.453 --> 06:15.092
I accuse you of harlotry.

06:15.173 --> 06:18.290
I accuse you
of destroying the sanctity of marriage.

06:18.373 --> 06:22.048
I accuse you
of bringing sin and disease to this town.

06:22.133 --> 06:25.762
You have blackened the sun
and bloodied the moon.

06:25.853 --> 06:29.209
I accuse you
of having a scorpion between your legs

06:29.293 --> 06:33.286
that destroys man's covenant with God!

06:33.373 --> 06:37.844
Cleanse yourself with death!
Free yourself from your sinful enslavement!

06:37.933 --> 06:39.685
Just get on with it.

06:39.773 --> 06:42.128
Then let us pray.

06:42.893 --> 06:46.647
O God, Jesus has said

06:46.733 --> 06:49.372
every tree is known by its fruits.

06:49.813 --> 06:54.887
This woman has brought forth bad fruit,
and we pray unto you today, Lord,

06:54.973 --> 06:58.602
to bless us as we rid our fair community
of this woman,

06:58.693 --> 07:02.686
this abomination, this scarlet temptress
who is ruining our town.

07:02.773 --> 07:06.607
I say unto her the day of wrath is at hand.

07:06.693 --> 07:08.524
Hyah!

07:10.613 --> 07:11.966
Hah!

07:26.053 --> 07:27.406
(cheering)

07:37.453 --> 07:39.011
(laughs)

08:05.573 --> 08:09.691
Seems more like a lifetime than three years.

08:09.773 --> 08:15.291
I'm not exactly...
your blushing bride any more.

08:17.133 --> 08:20.887
I know you don't hold it against me, but I do.

08:22.613 --> 08:26.322
At least I never let another man kiss me.

08:27.333 --> 08:30.006
(train whistle)

08:33.893 --> 08:38.967
I'll always have you in my heart.
If nothing else, at least that's sacred.

08:39.053 --> 08:43.011
If we don't put ground between us
and Echo City, we won't be going anywhere.

08:45.733 --> 08:48.122
(train bell clangs)

08:54.933 --> 08:59.324
Hey there. We're with the Pinkerton Detective
Agency. I wonder if you can help us.

08:59.413 --> 09:02.689
We're looking for a Mrs. Matilda Clayborne.

09:02.773 --> 09:05.241
That's her in the buggy.

09:05.333 --> 09:07.449
Thank you.

09:08.173 --> 09:11.609
They're way out of my jurisdiction
by now, Mrs. Clayborne.

09:11.693 --> 09:15.845
Chappy, if you were anything more
than a pile of manure with a badge on it,

09:15.933 --> 09:18.003
my colonel might still be alive.

09:18.093 --> 09:23.645
I didn't put no gun to your mister's head
and make him jump that whore.

09:23.733 --> 09:24.961
Bitch.

09:28.293 --> 09:31.126
We came as soon as we got the wire.
Sorry about your husband.

09:31.213 --> 09:33.044
You're wasting time.

09:33.133 --> 09:38.605
I'm hiring you because what passes for the
law around here won't leave this jurisdiction.

09:38.693 --> 09:44.006
I want that filthy harlot killed
or brought back to me, no matter what.

09:44.093 --> 09:46.323
I had these drawn up.

09:47.613 --> 09:51.049
That's just a taste of what you'll get
when you bring her back here.

09:53.573 --> 09:56.485
Sonny, you want to get our mounts
off the horse car?

09:56.573 --> 09:58.484
- Yes, sir.
- Don't worry, ma'am.

09:58.573 --> 10:02.885
You just point us which way they went,
we'll track 'em all right.

10:46.693 --> 10:49.332
OK, lift it. Higher.

10:50.733 --> 10:52.485
OK, ease it down.

10:52.573 --> 10:53.972
(crash)

10:54.053 --> 10:57.329
(Anita) That should do it.

10:57.413 --> 10:59.722
- (rattlesnake rattles)
- (neighing)

11:02.133 --> 11:04.124
The wagon!

11:04.933 --> 11:07.970
Are you all right, Sweetpea?

11:21.573 --> 11:23.131
Yah!

11:41.973 --> 11:43.247
Whoa!

11:48.133 --> 11:50.363
Whoa! Whoa!

11:51.533 --> 11:53.364
Whoa!

11:59.773 --> 12:02.162
Oh, whoa! Whoa, now!

12:05.853 --> 12:07.047
Whoa.

12:11.333 --> 12:14.291
Might as well eat this too.

12:14.373 --> 12:18.605
- You can't tell the one meat from the other.
- Yeah. Just like men.

12:18.693 --> 12:20.524
(giggling)

12:22.213 --> 12:25.728
So are we gonna find
another saloon somewhere?

12:25.813 --> 12:28.327
I'm finished with that.

12:28.413 --> 12:31.007
So am I.

12:33.693 --> 12:36.446
What have you got there?
Is that a stock certificate?

12:36.533 --> 12:41.368
It's a homesteader's claim
to 640 acres in the Oregon Territory.

12:41.453 --> 12:43.762
Jim and I had it.
It's what we came out west for.

12:43.853 --> 12:46.447
- What's it worth?
- A lot of hard work.

12:46.533 --> 12:49.411
Then what you got?
A farm - unless the bank takes it away.

12:49.493 --> 12:53.645
- We were gonna start a sawmill.
- A sawmill?

12:53.733 --> 12:58.045
Yeah. All the settling out here now
means more schools and saloons,

12:58.133 --> 13:00.124
churches, houses - that means lumber.

13:00.213 --> 13:03.489
How come
you never told us about this before?

13:04.333 --> 13:08.485
I don't know. I didn't know
how I was gonna do it all by myself.

13:08.573 --> 13:14.523
What I mean to say is,
I'd like it if you all go in with me.

13:14.613 --> 13:17.730
Together we could do it.
We could run a business.

13:17.813 --> 13:19.132
A sawmill?

13:19.213 --> 13:23.889
We sold our bodies.
Why can't we sell some wood?

13:26.213 --> 13:28.966
Might as well cook that thing more.
Won't hurt to burn it.

13:29.053 --> 13:31.487
I suppose not.

13:32.493 --> 13:34.927
Takes money.

13:36.413 --> 13:38.563
Building a sawmill takes money.

13:38.653 --> 13:43.363
I know. I'm probably just dreaming,
but it's the closest thing to a plan we've got.

13:43.453 --> 13:45.887
Well, it could be I got some.

13:48.133 --> 13:52.729
In Agua Dulce. Been wiring it there for years.
Over $12,000 now.

13:52.813 --> 13:54.804
What? Tw...

13:55.893 --> 13:59.568
- What are you saying?
- I'm saying sawmill.

14:01.013 --> 14:03.163
Why the hell not?

14:07.253 --> 14:10.928
Yeah. Why the hell not?

14:15.893 --> 14:17.212
Ooh!

14:19.293 --> 14:21.284
A sawmill!

14:27.893 --> 14:32.091
- As long as I don't get any splinters.
- Oh, Eileen!

14:35.853 --> 14:37.844
This stuff's... raunchy.

14:37.933 --> 14:40.925
(Anita) That's why they call it rotgut.

14:42.053 --> 14:44.089
(Lilly) Oh, it hits you quick.

14:44.173 --> 14:46.528
(giggling)

14:52.973 --> 14:54.964
Whoa.

14:56.253 --> 15:00.724
- Maybe a day old.
- They was pullin' a wagon.

15:00.813 --> 15:04.886
If it don't rain,
it won't be hard pickin' 'em up.

15:28.133 --> 15:30.249
(horse snorts)

15:54.053 --> 15:56.044
Morning, ma'am.

15:57.653 --> 16:02.647
Don't go firing that thing.
I just wanna show you something.

16:06.133 --> 16:10.206
I must say
the likeness doesn't do you justice.

16:16.573 --> 16:19.212
Yeah, that's me all right.

16:19.293 --> 16:21.568
My name's McCoy. Joshua McCoy.

16:21.653 --> 16:24.121
Where are you headed, Mr. McCoy?

16:24.213 --> 16:26.363
I'm a prospector, see?

16:26.453 --> 16:29.684
These hills are too picked over.
I thought I'd make my way up north.

16:29.773 --> 16:32.492
I've seen prospectors. You don't look like one.

16:32.573 --> 16:35.326
Oh, I am. Truly am.

16:36.493 --> 16:40.964
I'm counting on making a big strike
soon as I get some things taken care of.

16:41.053 --> 16:45.569
You wouldn't be thinking this reward
would be part of your stake, would you?

16:47.813 --> 16:51.283
No, ma'am, I'm just riding
in the same direction as you.

16:53.893 --> 16:57.203
All right. Put on your hat
and be on your way, Mr. McCoy.

16:58.773 --> 17:01.412
Only if you put your clothes on.

17:04.453 --> 17:06.489
- Get movin'.
- Ma'am.

17:10.413 --> 17:14.372
One more thing. They put Pinkertons
on your trail. You best keep moving.

17:18.733 --> 17:21.452
Pack everything on horseback.
We're leaving the wagon.

17:21.532 --> 17:23.683
- What about our things?
- Leave 'em.

17:23.772 --> 17:26.333
We gotta be in Agua Dulce by tomorrow.

17:56.373 --> 17:59.126
- Yes, may I help you?
- Yeah.

18:00.413 --> 18:05.009
- I wanna buy a dress.
- What kind of dress did you have in mind?

18:05.093 --> 18:08.244
One of the ready-to-wear kind
like in that Sears catalogue.

18:08.333 --> 18:13.123
I really think a woman like you
would be happier shopping someplace else.

18:14.533 --> 18:17.331
(bell tolls)

18:19.493 --> 18:21.609
(man) Hyah! Come on!

18:52.013 --> 18:54.607
Morning, ma'am.

19:02.973 --> 19:05.726
(woman) Good day, Mr. Landaker.

19:11.373 --> 19:13.967
- I believe you dropped this.
- Why, thank you.

19:14.053 --> 19:15.964
- My pleasure.
- I'm new here.

19:16.053 --> 19:19.648
If it wouldn't be too much trouble,
could you suggest a respectable place

19:19.733 --> 19:22.850
where I might have a meal
and a decent libation?

19:22.933 --> 19:26.448
Now, I just might know of such a place.

19:26.533 --> 19:28.649
(whispers)

19:30.013 --> 19:35.690
How dare you cast such lewd
and salacious aspersions upon my person!

19:35.773 --> 19:37.968
But... that might be interesting.

19:38.053 --> 19:42.604
Eileen! You don't gotta whore yourself
with the first old fart that comes along.

19:44.413 --> 19:46.973
- Silly child!
- Tramps, the both of you!

19:47.053 --> 19:49.123
Huh! Lilly!

19:49.213 --> 19:53.604
Can't you tell I was just trying
to get something passable to eat?

19:53.693 --> 19:56.810
Oh, yeah? And I'm Wyatt Earp.

19:56.893 --> 20:00.442
- Can I have a kiss, Wyatt Earp?
- Don't you pucker up to me, Eileen.

20:00.533 --> 20:03.172
Come on. Come on. Mm!

20:11.133 --> 20:13.124
Eileen.

20:16.213 --> 20:18.932
(Eileen and Lilly whistle)

20:25.453 --> 20:27.523
Uh... Well...

20:28.453 --> 20:32.412
- How can I help you, madam?
- I would like to close out my account.

20:34.013 --> 20:37.562
Pardon me, I don't believe I know you.
You have an account with us?

20:37.653 --> 20:43.285
Oh, yes. I set it up six years ago
and I've been wiring deposits ever since.

20:43.373 --> 20:45.443
Miss Annalee Zamora.

20:45.533 --> 20:47.569
Please come in, Miss Zamora.

20:47.653 --> 20:50.804
- Thank you.
- Just have a seat right there.

20:52.053 --> 20:57.286
Now, then, if you don't mind,
could I just take a look at your bank book?

20:57.373 --> 21:01.127
Oh! Oh, I'm afraid there's a bit of a problem.

21:01.213 --> 21:04.967
You see, we had a fire, and it was terrible.

21:05.053 --> 21:08.682
I just... I really can't say.

21:08.773 --> 21:12.891
Oh. I do recall signing something
some time ago.

21:12.973 --> 21:16.170
You must have my signature
on file somewhere.

21:16.973 --> 21:19.203
- I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

21:36.333 --> 21:38.642
- We're with the Pinkerton...
- I can see that.

21:38.733 --> 21:41.406
We're following a harlot,
name of Cody Zamora.

21:41.493 --> 21:44.405
She killed a fella up in Colorado Territory.

21:44.493 --> 21:47.724
- She's with a bunch of other whores.
- These are some bad girls.

21:47.813 --> 21:50.407
This one rode in this morning
with three others.

21:50.493 --> 21:54.486
It's very unusual to carry an account like this.

21:56.373 --> 22:00.924
- There's considerable funds.
- $12,432, I believe.

22:01.013 --> 22:06.041
- Why, yes. A little more with the interest.
- How lovely.

22:06.133 --> 22:08.567
- Cody!
- You can't go in there!

22:08.653 --> 22:11.611
- You gotta listen to me.
- This is my sister...

22:11.693 --> 22:14.526
(all shout at once)

22:14.613 --> 22:18.686
- Get!
- (manager) She belongs to you, does she?

22:18.773 --> 22:20.729
It's all right, Jenkins.

22:21.413 --> 22:23.722
- It's all right.
- Yes, sir.

22:26.653 --> 22:29.372
I am so sorry.

22:30.933 --> 22:33.845
My sister, she's a little...

22:39.653 --> 22:43.009
Anita. Those Pinkertons, they're here.

22:55.613 --> 22:57.012
Here you go.

23:03.093 --> 23:05.607
Cody! The Pinkertons are coming!

23:05.693 --> 23:08.890
Wrong, darlin'. The Pinkertons are here.

23:10.293 --> 23:13.842
Miss Zamora, if you'd come with me.

23:13.933 --> 23:15.924
Get her.

23:16.013 --> 23:17.651
Come on.

23:17.733 --> 23:20.850
Get off of me! Cody!

23:34.453 --> 23:36.364
Get up!

23:38.213 --> 23:41.489
Drop the gun. Drop it.

23:43.493 --> 23:45.848
You too.

23:45.933 --> 23:48.493
- Sîguele.
- Move it.

23:48.573 --> 23:51.041
Inside! A dentro!

23:51.133 --> 23:54.091
- Move!
- That's far enough, fat man.

23:56.693 --> 23:58.684
(screaming)

24:00.133 --> 24:02.442
- Come here. Open that door!
- Yes, sir.

24:02.533 --> 24:05.001
Come on! Get in there! You heard.

24:07.213 --> 24:10.011
Cody?

24:10.093 --> 24:13.290
Well, kiss my sister's black cat's ass!

24:13.373 --> 24:17.924
- What the hell are you doin' here?
- I'm making a withdrawal.

24:18.013 --> 24:21.449
So are we, darlin'.
How much you takin' out?

24:24.453 --> 24:27.729
Give the lady her money, fat man.

24:27.813 --> 24:29.929
Move it!

24:36.813 --> 24:39.964
- Thanks, Kid.
- For old times.

24:41.373 --> 24:44.570
Boss! We got it all. Let's ride.

24:44.653 --> 24:47.565
Come on. Get outta here!

24:58.893 --> 25:00.485
Let's go.

25:00.573 --> 25:02.609
(gunshots)

25:02.693 --> 25:04.729
Let's get outta here! Now!

25:13.413 --> 25:15.483
Come on, Eileen.

25:16.413 --> 25:18.404
Get up!

25:20.853 --> 25:23.811
(Eileen groans)

25:23.893 --> 25:27.772
- Eileen, get your behind on that horse.
- What do you think I'm trying to do?

25:41.133 --> 25:43.806
You know where to find me, darlin'.

25:44.653 --> 25:47.087
Son of a bitch!

25:49.573 --> 25:52.690
- Shit!
- Eileen! Come on, Eileen!

25:54.453 --> 25:55.442
Hyah!

25:56.373 --> 25:58.125
Stop!

26:00.933 --> 26:03.163
(neighs angrily)

26:09.933 --> 26:11.969
Cody!

26:12.053 --> 26:14.692
Come here! Come here, you tramp!

26:17.973 --> 26:20.441
- Get your hands off me!
- You little tart!

26:20.533 --> 26:23.843
- Dammit!
- Stand still!

26:24.613 --> 26:29.812
- You. William Tucker. I'm deputizing you.
- I gotta get back to my place.

26:29.893 --> 26:34.603
Yeah, well, I gotta form a posse
and get after them stinkin' Jarretts.

26:34.693 --> 26:39.050
Put that down, take her over and lock her up.
Think you can do that, Deputy?

26:39.133 --> 26:42.762
- I heard you twice the first time.
- Well then, goddammit, do it.

26:42.853 --> 26:46.402
Earl, show 'em the way
and then get yourself fixed up.

26:46.493 --> 26:48.723
Yeah, all right, boss.

26:53.613 --> 26:57.083
All right.
Who's gonna volunteer for the posse?

26:57.813 --> 27:00.611
Come on.
We gotta get 'em before they cross the river.

27:00.693 --> 27:04.925
- I'll go, Marshal.
- Damn stranger's the only one with guts?

27:05.013 --> 27:09.723
It's your damn money they stole.
You just gonna stand there and take it?

27:12.093 --> 27:15.881
All right, that's better. Let's mount up.

27:16.773 --> 27:20.288
- You feel like a big man?
- I feel like my damn shoulder hurts.

27:20.373 --> 27:22.933
You sit down. Act like a lady.

27:23.013 --> 27:26.562
Tucker, watch her.
I'm going to the damn doctor.

27:56.013 --> 27:58.083
- William?
- Yes, ma'am.

27:58.173 --> 28:01.131
Come closer. Please.

28:11.493 --> 28:14.371
- Do I look like a criminal?
- No, ma'am.

28:15.933 --> 28:19.562
- I ain't no bank robber.
- I ain't no deputy.

28:19.653 --> 28:21.769
Why don't you just let me go?

28:24.373 --> 28:27.092
I'd like to. I really would.

28:29.973 --> 28:32.168
But I can't.

28:34.973 --> 28:37.043
I'm sorry.

28:52.653 --> 28:55.167
(sobs)

29:03.333 --> 29:06.723
Ma'am, you shouldn't oughta
carry on like that.

29:08.253 --> 29:10.528
Oh, God...

29:10.613 --> 29:13.525
When the marshal gets back
he'll straighten everything out.

29:26.653 --> 29:28.644
We ain't gonna follow 'em?

29:28.733 --> 29:31.930
We ain't the law over there. We go back.

29:43.413 --> 29:46.246
Are we gonna get her out?

29:46.333 --> 29:49.848
- Are we gonna get Eileen?
- How are we gonna do that?

29:49.933 --> 29:52.652
I don't know, but we got you out
when they were gonna lynch you.

29:52.733 --> 29:55.201
Well now, that was lucky.

29:55.293 --> 29:57.932
Look, I don't let my friends get hung.

29:58.013 --> 30:00.846
I want her out just as much as you.

30:00.933 --> 30:03.527
They're not gonna hang her, so rest easy.

30:03.613 --> 30:07.003
Do nothing? Shit.

30:07.093 --> 30:10.290
I'm going to Kid Jarrett.
I figure he's our best chance.

30:10.373 --> 30:15.163
Kid Jarrett's our best chance? That son
of a bitch was nothing but trouble to you.

30:15.253 --> 30:19.326
- That was a long time ago.
- This morning he stole our money.

30:19.413 --> 30:22.052
That's Kid's way
of inviting me to come over and see him.

30:22.133 --> 30:25.284
- Ha!
- Hell of an invitation.

30:25.373 --> 30:29.207
Look, you don't know him. He's bored.

30:29.293 --> 30:33.206
He'll give us back our money and spring
Eileen from jail just for the hell of it.

30:33.293 --> 30:35.807
You're rating yourself awful high, Cody.

30:36.973 --> 30:40.648
I ran with that gang. I know what I'm doing.

30:41.253 --> 30:43.209
- Where the hell you going?
- With you.

30:43.293 --> 30:45.568
You don't go anywhere near the Jarretts.

30:45.653 --> 30:49.487
- I'm going with you, Cody.
- I'm warning you. You stay put.

30:50.733 --> 30:53.691
You don't do what I tell you, you're both out.

31:08.653 --> 31:13.681
New Orleans.
My daddy had a big house in the Quarter.

31:13.773 --> 31:16.207
That's the French Quarter.

31:16.293 --> 31:20.206
- Parlez francais?
- Excuse me?

31:20.973 --> 31:24.807
It's French.
It's the language of love, you know.

31:25.613 --> 31:28.173
I didn't know the language of love had words.

31:28.253 --> 31:30.244
Oh, my, yes.

31:31.253 --> 31:34.086
- I could teach you.
- (clears throat) Huh?

31:34.173 --> 31:36.323
French. I could teach you French.

31:37.013 --> 31:39.288
Oh. Of course.

31:42.013 --> 31:45.926
- So you're a rancher?
- I got a couple dozen head of longhorns.

31:46.013 --> 31:48.846
- Cattle rancher.
- Yes, ma'am.

31:50.053 --> 31:54.365
- Nearby?
- Yes, about 16 miles out on North Road.

31:54.453 --> 31:57.570
It's a beautiful piece of land.

31:57.653 --> 31:59.803
It's called the Circle Bar T.

31:59.893 --> 32:02.885
- Circle Bar T?
- Yes, ma'am.

32:02.973 --> 32:05.885
It's a nice name.

32:13.093 --> 32:15.084
Rico!

32:19.653 --> 32:22.451
- You cannot come here.
- Quiero hablar con Kid Jarrett.

32:22.533 --> 32:27.243
- No hay nadie aquî con ese nombre.
- ? Como carajos no?

32:27.333 --> 32:32.487
No me gustarîa estar en tu pellejo
si Kid supiera como trataste a Cody Zamora.

32:32.573 --> 32:34.882
Cody Zamora.

32:34.973 --> 32:37.931
Bueno. Venga conmigo.

32:50.213 --> 32:52.283
Deme su pistola.

32:59.013 --> 33:02.767
!Hola, señorita!
You here to keep the boys happy?

33:02.853 --> 33:05.048
(makes kissing sounds)

33:17.213 --> 33:19.522
Espera aquî.

33:26.293 --> 33:28.761
It's been a long time, Cody.

33:29.973 --> 33:33.761
- It's been a long time, Frank.
- Yeah.

33:50.413 --> 33:53.086
Kid said you were back in Texas.

33:53.173 --> 33:56.245
- He tell you he stole my money?
- He said you'd be coming.

33:56.333 --> 34:01.088
Damn right. That money is our stake
for a new start in the Oregon Territory.

34:01.173 --> 34:04.165
- Yours and whose, darlin'?
- Me and some friends.

34:04.253 --> 34:09.202
- One of us got a homesteader's claim.
- Oregon. I ran there once.

34:09.293 --> 34:12.728
Why didn't I see you at the bank?

34:12.813 --> 34:15.964
I got what I need right here.

34:16.053 --> 34:20.922
Mucha tequila. Muchas bonitas.

34:21.693 --> 34:23.728
Well, Kid's still hungry.

34:23.813 --> 34:29.012
Yeah. Thinks he can make a bigger name
for himself than his old man.

34:29.092 --> 34:33.166
Always did want what I had, didn't he?

34:33.733 --> 34:35.563
Well, look who's here.

34:37.853 --> 34:40.492
We got us some talking to do, Kid.

34:40.572 --> 34:42.962
Let's talk.

34:45.893 --> 34:48.726
See you around, Frank.

34:58.053 --> 35:00.613
Playing with the big guns now, Kid?

35:00.693 --> 35:04.208
- You know I always liked playing with things.
- Mm-hm.

35:05.213 --> 35:08.285
Taking trains too, I see.

35:08.373 --> 35:13.527
Military shipment.
Selling US army guns to Juarez.

35:13.613 --> 35:19.848
It's funny what you can find out when
you're running panocha to the army colonels.

35:21.653 --> 35:24.247
By Friday
I'll be up to my ass in Mexican gold.

35:24.333 --> 35:28.451
- I'll bet you will.
- !Despuês de una pinchi fiesta!

35:28.533 --> 35:30.763
!En julio!

35:32.493 --> 35:35.610
Vete! Vete!

35:42.093 --> 35:45.972
- So what's on your mind?
- You invited me.

35:46.053 --> 35:48.442
Didn't you wanna come?

35:48.533 --> 35:50.444
For the old days.

35:50.533 --> 35:53.525
Remember when we went ridin'
with that bunch down Tucson,

35:53.613 --> 35:56.491
runnin' those guns into Durango?
You remember that?

35:57.213 --> 36:00.125
We had us some times, didn't we?

36:07.733 --> 36:10.372
You lyin' bitch.

36:14.173 --> 36:17.722
- You've just come here for your money.
- What's the difference, Kid?

36:17.813 --> 36:20.646
You're gonna be up to your ass
in Mexican gold by Friday.

36:20.733 --> 36:24.521
That's right.
What's $10,000 one way or the other?

36:24.613 --> 36:29.607
$12,432. Why don't you just give it to me
and I'll be on my way?

36:32.413 --> 36:37.203
Look, I was only playing with you.
You can have your money.

36:44.333 --> 36:46.324
Keep the change.

36:48.653 --> 36:51.372
Thanks, Kid.

36:51.453 --> 36:55.332
What makes you think
Oregon's gonna be any different? Hm?

36:56.453 --> 36:59.570
A new start for an old whore.

37:01.933 --> 37:03.924
Why don't you just say it, Kid?

37:04.013 --> 37:09.371
- You're sore at me for running out on you.
- Sore? Why would I be sore?

37:09.453 --> 37:10.886
Hm?

37:12.053 --> 37:16.365
Because you ran out on me in the middle
of the night without saying a word? Hm?

37:16.453 --> 37:18.842
I'll see you around.

37:31.733 --> 37:35.282
- She ain't comin' back.
- She is so.

37:35.373 --> 37:39.491
I'm going to get Eileen.
Are you with me or not?

37:39.573 --> 37:44.693
- When Cody comes back and we're not here...
- Don't worry about it. She'll wait.

37:44.773 --> 37:47.207
- Gee up!
- Lilly...

38:26.853 --> 38:29.162
Don't hurt me.

38:29.253 --> 38:31.562
There's no chance of that.

38:41.893 --> 38:46.250
Electric chair! If you ask me,
it'd be a hell of a lot cheaper just to hang 'em.

38:46.333 --> 38:50.326
That way you can use the rope
over and over again.

38:51.333 --> 38:53.893
- What's that?
- Huh?

38:53.973 --> 38:56.771
There. That's that whore.

38:58.333 --> 39:01.052
- That ain't her.
- You're drunk.

39:01.653 --> 39:05.805
- She's been beaten. Can you help her?
- Here. Here.

39:09.013 --> 39:12.767
- On bed.
- Her back was beaten.

39:14.613 --> 39:17.173
(speaks Chinese)

39:18.173 --> 39:20.164
(speaks Chinese)

39:20.253 --> 39:24.371
Why we gotta walk all the way down here?

39:24.453 --> 39:28.446
- Cos she's in one of these tents. I seen her.
- You ain't seen her.

39:28.533 --> 39:32.731
I say we go right across the street
and get our bell ropes pulled.

39:32.813 --> 39:37.568
- I thought we were off duty.
- We ain't ever off duty.

39:39.133 --> 39:41.169
Hey, fellas.

39:41.253 --> 39:43.721
You those fellas
after that whore from Echo City?

39:43.813 --> 39:46.532
What's it to you?

39:46.613 --> 39:48.763
You seen her?

39:48.853 --> 39:51.242
Well, now, that depends.

39:52.373 --> 39:55.683
That poster talked about a reward?

39:55.773 --> 39:59.971
- Could be there's a real big reward.
- Could be I know where that whore is.

40:00.053 --> 40:02.487
- Where'd that be?
- Where'd that reward be?

40:05.093 --> 40:08.165
$500. Wired to you when we get her.

40:10.053 --> 40:12.248
My word as a Peckerton detinctive.

40:20.053 --> 40:22.772
$500 is more than I'm used to.

40:24.613 --> 40:28.731
Right. I seen that whore Cody
riding upriver not an hour ago.

40:28.813 --> 40:31.008
Why didn't you do something?

40:31.093 --> 40:34.927
- She's with Kid Jarrett.
- You sure it were Kid Jarrett?

40:35.013 --> 40:38.767
Sure enough. I'd have done something,
but I ain't no Peckerton detinctive.

40:38.853 --> 40:43.369
Hell! Cody Zamora and Kid Jarrett!

40:52.813 --> 40:56.931
(speaks Chinese)

41:01.893 --> 41:06.091
Gunpowder heal wound.

41:16.813 --> 41:19.805
- (gasps)
- OK. OK.

41:20.813 --> 41:22.804
(groans)

41:29.693 --> 41:33.208
It'll be all right. It'll be all right.

41:37.693 --> 41:40.332
- Tucker?
- What do you want, Earl?

41:40.413 --> 41:42.688
Get out here, Tucker.

41:49.813 --> 41:53.249
- What are you doin'?
- Interrogating the prisoner.

41:53.333 --> 41:55.324
You ain't trained for that.

41:55.413 --> 41:58.849
- I'll take over.
- I'm making some real good headway.

41:58.933 --> 42:01.003
Your ranch is waiting on you, boy.

42:01.093 --> 42:04.165
I expect that can wait a good while longer.

42:04.253 --> 42:07.484
I been talking to her. She ain't no bank robber.

42:09.893 --> 42:13.442
In fact,
she's a real fine lady from New Orleans.

42:13.533 --> 42:15.922
Tucker, you go home now.

42:16.013 --> 42:17.002
(door opens)

42:18.493 --> 42:21.212
Um... I'm turning myself in.

42:21.293 --> 42:25.730
- Say what?
- I was with the gang that robbed the bank.

42:25.813 --> 42:27.804
I can't take it any more.

42:27.893 --> 42:30.646
Maybe you ought to sit down.

42:31.733 --> 42:32.927
(sighs)

42:33.013 --> 42:34.924
Eileen?

42:36.533 --> 42:40.003
- It's about damn time.
- Here, tie this on.

42:47.573 --> 42:51.009
Y'all don't know how hard it is...
bein' hunted.

42:51.093 --> 42:55.166
Men wantin' you everywhere you go.

42:55.253 --> 42:58.370
I just wanna be safe.

42:58.453 --> 43:04.608
What are you doin' standing here?
Go and question the prisoner, son.

43:09.933 --> 43:14.404
- William? How would you like to kiss me?
- Excuse me?

43:14.493 --> 43:18.088
First... they hurt me right there.

43:18.173 --> 43:19.288
Mm.

43:19.373 --> 43:25.243
And then... they hurt me right there.

43:25.333 --> 43:27.130
Mm-mm-mm-mm.

43:29.013 --> 43:32.562
Those may be severe injuries,
but I don't see any marks.

43:33.453 --> 43:35.921
Perhaps if you just move it up a little bit.

43:48.933 --> 43:50.889
(laughs)

43:52.013 --> 43:54.129
(makes clicking noises)

43:56.493 --> 43:58.609
- (horse neighs)
- Shit!

43:58.693 --> 44:00.809
Dammit! Dammit!

44:00.893 --> 44:05.205
- Well, I've got more injuries.
- Show me later.

44:07.453 --> 44:09.887
Getting me out in the middle of something...

44:11.573 --> 44:13.450
Oh...

44:13.533 --> 44:17.412
Here's your chance to be a big hero
to someone in real trouble.

44:17.493 --> 44:20.565
I swear on my honor as a Southern lady.

44:21.493 --> 44:24.724
- Get out of my way.
- Hang on.

44:24.813 --> 44:28.522
I didn't have anything to do with that robbery.
You have to believe me.

44:28.613 --> 44:31.605
- Move.
- Please, William.

44:31.693 --> 44:34.571
I don't know why I believe you, but I do.

44:34.653 --> 44:37.121
- You're doing the right thing.
- Yeah, sure.

44:37.213 --> 44:39.488
- Come on. Get out.
- You know what?

44:39.573 --> 44:41.962
- For your own good.
- Wait! Hang on now!

44:42.053 --> 44:46.171
You're gonna have to wait in there.
I don't want anything bad to happen to you.

44:46.253 --> 44:49.928
- You tell them we held a gun to your head.
- Eileen, come on.

44:50.013 --> 44:53.210
Let's go. You take care, William.

44:56.653 --> 44:59.213
Let's get the hell outta here. Come on.

44:59.293 --> 45:02.046
They tried to make me eat beans.

45:05.533 --> 45:07.524
Gee up!

45:14.693 --> 45:16.684
Hold up! Hold up!

45:18.893 --> 45:21.282
- Cody's horse.
- See if you can find her.

45:21.373 --> 45:24.126
- We'll be at the Circle Bar T. 16 miles.
- OK.

45:24.213 --> 45:26.602
- Up the road next to Turtle Creek.
- Got it.

45:26.693 --> 45:28.684
Let's go.

45:34.653 --> 45:36.723
Don't worry, mister.

45:36.813 --> 45:38.804
Wife be OK.

45:41.293 --> 45:43.807
Thank you.

45:49.533 --> 45:52.047
Well, Mr. McCoy...

45:53.693 --> 45:56.082
you seem to be my lucky penny.

45:58.853 --> 46:04.325
It weren't no accident I was in Echo City
or that I tracked you here.

46:05.333 --> 46:09.531
Word was you had a history with the Jarretts.

46:17.533 --> 46:19.524
I told you I was a prospector.

46:19.613 --> 46:21.604
That's all true.

46:21.693 --> 46:26.926
I'm on my way to the Klondike. Got a claim
there that could be worth a fortune in gold.

46:27.013 --> 46:30.528
But first I got an old score to settle
with Frank Jarrett.

46:30.613 --> 46:33.889
He jumped my father's claim
and he killed him.

46:33.973 --> 46:36.692
And my ma was done... like you was.

46:40.893 --> 46:43.361
She lived on a couple of years.

46:47.133 --> 46:50.170
I swore on her grave
I'd live to see Frank Jarrett die.

46:53.293 --> 46:57.286
So you figured the Jarretts' whore
might lead you back to 'em?

46:58.453 --> 47:00.444
Yes, ma'am.

47:01.613 --> 47:04.207
That was the truth of it.

47:12.173 --> 47:14.164
I didn't get our money.

47:42.493 --> 47:45.132
Circle Bar T, all right.

47:45.213 --> 47:47.966
- This is big.
- Ha!

47:48.053 --> 47:50.362
This ain't so big.

47:50.453 --> 47:53.286
This used to all be free-range.

47:53.373 --> 47:56.809
The law of the land
was cattle could go where they pleased.

47:56.893 --> 47:58.884
See that barbed wire?

47:58.973 --> 48:04.491
That let small ranchers get started without
being overrun by cattle from the big outfits.

48:04.573 --> 48:08.691
Folks say
the West was conquered by the railroad.

48:08.773 --> 48:13.722
Uh-uh. My daddy says
it was conquered by barbed wire.

48:13.813 --> 48:19.285
You sure know a lot about this
for a fine Southern lady from New Orleans.

48:19.373 --> 48:22.922
Oh, Lilly. I ain't from New Orleans.

48:23.013 --> 48:25.004
I'd like to have been.

48:25.093 --> 48:31.168
I grew up on an East Texas grub ranch,
not much different from this one.

48:31.253 --> 48:37.772
I don't know much about grub ranches,
but this sure looks nice to me, Eileen.

48:37.853 --> 48:40.162
It's got possibilities.

48:41.213 --> 48:44.489
(subdued plotting)

48:46.853 --> 48:50.766
Well, ain't this sweet?

48:52.133 --> 48:55.409
Little boy's gonna rob an army choo-choo.

48:56.413 --> 49:00.452
Gonna get himself a big new toy gun, huh?

49:01.773 --> 49:04.367
That gun's gonna make me rich, old man.

49:28.733 --> 49:31.008
(hums to herself)

49:38.053 --> 49:43.650
Oh, hi, William. I hope you don't mind.
I kinda helped myself to a few things.

49:46.373 --> 49:50.525
I... I've made a really nice stew.

50:02.093 --> 50:04.891
I wouldn't go in there if I was you.

50:09.253 --> 50:12.165
Our friend's restin' in your bed.

50:12.253 --> 50:16.166
It sure is nice of you to let us stay here,
Mr. Tucker.

50:16.253 --> 50:20.485
Most kind. Wouldn't you like some stew?
And I've made some pies.

50:20.573 --> 50:22.564
Sure smells good.

50:22.653 --> 50:24.644
Hi. Joshua McCoy.

50:24.733 --> 50:28.123
You got a real nice spread here, William.

50:28.213 --> 50:30.204
That's just great.

50:31.573 --> 50:34.212
That's just great.

50:34.293 --> 50:38.081
Why don't y'all
just make yourselves at home?

51:00.173 --> 51:04.371
I've been alone out here
going on a couple of years.

51:04.453 --> 51:07.047
Since my family died.

51:07.133 --> 51:09.772
I reckon
you're the first company I've had out here.

51:11.133 --> 51:17.208
And I guess I wouldn't be much of a man
if I wasn't at least hospitable.

51:21.933 --> 51:23.924
Welcome to my home.

51:55.093 --> 52:00.565
The population of the United States
is over 63 million people now.

52:02.453 --> 52:04.967
Well, they sure ain't here.

52:05.053 --> 52:09.092
- Better let you get some rest.
- No, you can stay.

52:12.733 --> 52:15.725
Well, I suppose I don't wanna be alone.

52:20.453 --> 52:24.366
- That's funny?
- It's funnier than you know.

52:31.493 --> 52:33.484
I suppose I'd like to stay.

52:50.573 --> 52:53.610
(plays "Streets Of Laredo")

53:04.813 --> 53:07.611
May I have the pleasure of a dance?

53:08.973 --> 53:11.441
Oh, I don't know.

53:11.533 --> 53:14.127
Come on.
You're not gonna turn me down, are you?

53:14.213 --> 53:17.489
I... I don't do a lot of dancin' out here.

53:18.973 --> 53:21.931
I feel kinda silly.

53:26.693 --> 53:29.082
(William clears his throat)

53:51.413 --> 53:53.404
(both laugh)

54:11.156 --> 54:13.795
You boys are making me very angry.

54:13.876 --> 54:17.551
Now, let's not be shy and do what I told you.

54:19.316 --> 54:23.309
That's it. You boys are gonna be famous.

54:23.396 --> 54:27.992
Tell your grandchildren
you got held up by Kid Jarrett.

54:37.836 --> 54:42.387
Don't look so sad, boys.
You look good in your drawers.

54:45.196 --> 54:47.232
You fools be careful with that thing!

54:47.316 --> 54:50.592
That's precious cargo we've got there.

54:53.756 --> 54:56.145
Shit! It's OK, boss.

55:22.436 --> 55:24.427
Hyah! Get up!

55:36.956 --> 55:38.947
Now.

55:45.036 --> 55:46.674
Up in the hills!

56:08.196 --> 56:11.427
What are you doing, Jack?
Get this wagon outta here!

56:11.516 --> 56:13.871
Yeah, boss!

56:23.756 --> 56:25.747
Where are you going, Jack?

56:27.556 --> 56:30.673
God damn you, Roberto!
Come back here and fight!

56:30.756 --> 56:33.270
Yuma! Roberto!

56:34.596 --> 56:37.269
Yellow dogs! Get back here!

56:42.036 --> 56:44.186
Oh, damn!

56:50.716 --> 56:52.115
(horse neighs)

56:55.916 --> 56:57.986
Aaagh!

57:02.156 --> 57:04.272
Ned! Ned!

57:05.316 --> 57:07.591
Ned! Where are you going?

57:09.156 --> 57:12.068
- Get up! Get up!
- (explosion)

57:12.156 --> 57:14.226
(Cody) Anita!

57:18.916 --> 57:21.146
Get your yellow asses back here, cowards!

57:25.196 --> 57:27.664
- Can you get up?
- Yeah.

57:37.076 --> 57:38.634
(whistles)

57:38.716 --> 57:40.354
Hyah!

57:41.076 --> 57:42.191
Hyah!

57:49.916 --> 57:53.386
Hyah! Hyah!

57:58.516 --> 58:02.589
You dumb ass! It ain't nothin'
but Cody and a bunch of women!

58:02.676 --> 58:05.554
Better go find your toys, sonny!

58:28.756 --> 58:31.316
Where do you think you're going?

58:31.396 --> 58:34.149
Jarrett, you asshole!

58:38.556 --> 58:41.150
The name of the man killing you
is Joshua McCoy.

58:41.236 --> 58:43.750
Don't mean spit to me, boy.

58:43.836 --> 58:46.191
Josh, they got Lilly. Kid's got Lilly.

58:46.996 --> 58:48.987
(Frank) Cody...

58:49.076 --> 58:52.034
Bring him along. We'll trade him for Lilly.

58:57.116 --> 59:00.074
Mira, vienen dos en caballo.

59:06.716 --> 59:09.025
Sorry, boss. What happened to Jack?

59:09.116 --> 59:11.994
You won't be seeing him no more.
What about you, Ned?

59:12.076 --> 59:16.911
Tried my best, boss. Almost
got my ass shot off. Lost my damn hat too.

59:16.996 --> 59:19.385
- Where's Frank?
- They got him and the guns.

59:19.476 --> 59:23.628
But we got this
and we're gonna make a little trade.

59:25.676 --> 59:29.351
I've seen one of these once
at the armory in Cheyenne.

59:29.436 --> 59:31.996
- (all grunt)
- It's heavy.

59:32.076 --> 59:37.104
We trade Frank for Lilly.
When we get her, we give Kid this toy.

59:37.196 --> 59:39.266
And we get our money back.

59:39.356 --> 59:42.428
- This is not a toy.
- Let's get to work.

59:42.516 --> 59:44.950
I can't believe we're thinking about doing this.

59:45.036 --> 59:47.834
I can't stand to think of her
with those disgusting men.

59:47.916 --> 59:51.352
The only reason she's there
is cos we went running off after Kid.

59:52.036 --> 59:56.314
- Are you saying this is my fault?
- All you care about is revenge on Kid.

59:56.396 --> 59:59.911
- You went with us, Anita. You came along.
- I never should have gone.

59:59.996 --> 01:00:03.466
None of us should have gone.
None of this should have happened.

01:00:04.876 --> 01:00:08.232
- We have no choice. We have to get Lilly.
- I know.

01:00:08.316 --> 01:00:10.750
- Anita.
- Let her go.

01:00:10.836 --> 01:00:11.905
Anita!

01:00:22.956 --> 01:00:25.675
(man) Anita! Anita!

01:00:28.716 --> 01:00:33.187
Can I have some of that water, please?
I'm mighty thirsty.

01:00:44.916 --> 01:00:46.986
Thank you.

01:00:52.396 --> 01:00:56.435
Couldn't help but overhearing
about that land.

01:00:56.516 --> 01:00:58.950
In Oregon, ain't it?

01:01:01.836 --> 01:01:03.906
Grand territory, Oregon.

01:01:03.996 --> 01:01:08.114
Spent a couple of years there once.
Lot of rain. Lot of laws.

01:01:08.996 --> 01:01:11.191
Don't like either.

01:01:11.276 --> 01:01:16.794
- Why are you talking to me?
- Cody told me about your plans.

01:01:16.876 --> 01:01:19.151
Sounds sweet.

01:01:20.076 --> 01:01:25.548
It's just that I've never heard of no single miss
holding a claim for land.

01:01:25.636 --> 01:01:28.230
In Oregon, that is.

01:01:30.476 --> 01:01:33.866
Just because you haven't heard of it
doesn't mean it can't happen.

01:01:33.956 --> 01:01:36.345
Suppose not.

01:01:47.836 --> 01:01:50.509
(horse neighs)

01:01:50.596 --> 01:01:54.509
- Where's she off to?
- She's just riding off some steam.

01:01:54.596 --> 01:01:56.951
She sure picked a good time to pitch a fit.

01:01:57.036 --> 01:01:59.869
If it were her in trouble,
Lilly'd be the first there.

01:02:01.396 --> 01:02:03.387
(Kid) What's your name?

01:02:04.476 --> 01:02:06.831
Lilly.

01:02:06.916 --> 01:02:10.511
- Just Lilly?
- Lilly's enough.

01:02:10.596 --> 01:02:12.587
Yeah, if you answer to it.

01:02:12.676 --> 01:02:15.270
That depends on who's askin'.

01:02:17.596 --> 01:02:22.033
You don't look much like a parlor-house girl
in those pants and boots.

01:02:22.116 --> 01:02:24.107
(all laugh)

01:02:24.196 --> 01:02:26.187
What's your family name?

01:02:30.796 --> 01:02:34.789
- Laronette.
- Laronette. Huh.

01:02:34.876 --> 01:02:39.392
I knowed a Roy Laronette. Seen him
in a Wild West show over in Del Rio.

01:02:39.476 --> 01:02:42.434
- Best trick rider I ever seed.
- Is that a fact?

01:02:42.516 --> 01:02:47.715
Well, how did the daughter of a trick rider
wind up working in a parlor house?

01:02:47.796 --> 01:02:50.390
He died.

01:02:50.476 --> 01:02:52.785
And the show died with him.

01:02:53.396 --> 01:02:55.956
It came up to me to pay off his debts.

01:02:56.636 --> 01:03:01.027
Oh. Well, ain't you Daddy's sweet little girl?

01:03:06.556 --> 01:03:09.628
- Sit her down.
- Sit down!

01:03:09.716 --> 01:03:12.105
We got a real hellcat here!

01:03:12.196 --> 01:03:15.427
May take some time breakin' her in.

01:03:17.116 --> 01:03:19.914
But it's gonna be a lot of fun doin' it.

01:03:35.036 --> 01:03:40.190
This claim of yours seems proper enough,
young lady. Why worry your little head?

01:03:40.276 --> 01:03:42.426
Your husband has matters well in hand.

01:03:44.356 --> 01:03:46.745
What if my husband is deceased?

01:04:02.796 --> 01:04:06.709
- Ma'am, I don't know how to tell you this...
- Tell me what?

01:04:06.796 --> 01:04:11.187
Your claim's worthless
without your husband alive.

01:04:12.796 --> 01:04:16.186
See for yourself. Second paragraph.

01:04:21.476 --> 01:04:23.831
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but it's the law.

01:04:23.916 --> 01:04:28.865
- Surely you understand that?
- Yes, I understand that.

01:04:28.956 --> 01:04:34.826
I was worthless until I married,
so now I guess I'm worthless as a widow.

01:04:34.916 --> 01:04:36.986
Funny, I had some value as a whore.

01:04:39.076 --> 01:04:41.795
- Did I shock you?
- No, ma'am, I...

01:04:41.876 --> 01:04:46.666
You expect me to cry all over your big desk?
Well, to hell with that!

01:04:46.756 --> 01:04:50.066
If your laws don't include me,
they don't apply to me either.

01:04:50.156 --> 01:04:54.627
Now, ma'am,
that'll still be six bits for my services.

01:05:03.276 --> 01:05:06.825
Keep the change, you sawed-off fart.

01:05:06.916 --> 01:05:08.269
(door slams)

01:05:19.476 --> 01:05:21.831
Don't let him play with you.

01:05:21.916 --> 01:05:27.946
Well, lookie here. My little whore
finally found herself a pretty-boy.

01:05:28.036 --> 01:05:30.755
Keep talkin'. That's all you can do.

01:05:30.836 --> 01:05:34.670
Was a time
I did a hell of a lot more than talk to you.

01:05:34.756 --> 01:05:39.989
You know where I found her?
She was scrubbin' floors in a parlor house.

01:05:40.076 --> 01:05:42.954
Wasn't more than 14.

01:05:48.276 --> 01:05:52.030
She weren't contrary like that back then.
No, sirree.

01:05:52.116 --> 01:05:56.906
Got her real excited,
bein' with a bunch of bandits.

01:05:56.996 --> 01:06:00.784
My God, how she'd open up to me.

01:06:00.876 --> 01:06:02.946
How she carried on.

01:06:03.036 --> 01:06:05.345
And you. Look at you.

01:06:05.436 --> 01:06:07.427
A lovesick pretty-boy.

01:06:07.516 --> 01:06:13.113
Now, after all these years
of wanting to kill me,

01:06:13.196 --> 01:06:15.585
she won't let you.

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:21.785
Nothing's changed.

01:06:21.876 --> 01:06:24.868
You're dead. I just ain't killed you yet.

01:06:30.436 --> 01:06:35.066
(sings "Lorena")

01:07:16.556 --> 01:07:19.992
Hey, pretty-boy. Come over here.

01:07:20.076 --> 01:07:22.306
Come over here. I got something to tell you.

01:07:35.596 --> 01:07:38.827
Yeah, you look just like your ma.

01:07:39.836 --> 01:07:41.952
Real pretty.

01:07:44.076 --> 01:07:46.829
Beautiful piece of a woman, your ma.

01:07:48.916 --> 01:07:52.511
Evangeline. Am I right?

01:07:54.156 --> 01:07:56.147
(gunshot)

01:07:58.556 --> 01:08:00.547
Josh!

01:08:04.876 --> 01:08:06.867
What happened?

01:08:10.956 --> 01:08:13.675
He tried to escape. I shot him.

01:08:25.276 --> 01:08:29.952
Did you shoot him
before or after you untied him?

01:08:33.475 --> 01:08:39.073
I said did you shoot him
before or after you untied him?

01:08:41.836 --> 01:08:43.827
He brought it on himself.

01:08:43.916 --> 01:08:46.555
He was playing you
and you couldn't rein yourself in

01:08:46.636 --> 01:08:49.514
and now we can't trade him for Lilly.

01:08:50.836 --> 01:08:55.033
Get the hell out of my sight.
Keep riding till you hit the Klondike.

01:09:50.156 --> 01:09:52.147
(Eileen) Anita?

01:09:52.236 --> 01:09:54.466
(Cody) Don't tell her.

01:09:56.356 --> 01:10:00.269
- Sweetpea, where have you been?
- The claim's no good.

01:10:00.356 --> 01:10:02.745
What?

01:10:02.836 --> 01:10:07.273
I went to a lawyer's office in town. He said
the claim's no good without Jim alive.

01:10:20.596 --> 01:10:23.394
- Let's go get Lilly.
- Come on.

01:10:25.196 --> 01:10:28.029
What are you lookin' at?

01:10:28.116 --> 01:10:29.185
Pigs.

01:10:29.276 --> 01:10:33.906
You're gonna be around here a while.
You better be a little bit more friendly, like.

01:10:33.996 --> 01:10:37.432
Over here is Rico.

01:10:37.516 --> 01:10:39.507
This here's Ned.

01:10:40.756 --> 01:10:42.747
Roberto.

01:10:44.716 --> 01:10:46.707
And this here's Yuma.

01:10:46.796 --> 01:10:49.868
Me and Yuma go back a long way.
Ain't that right, partner?

01:10:49.956 --> 01:10:52.026
A long ways, Kid.

01:10:52.116 --> 01:10:56.428
Go inside and get one of Cody's old dresses
out of my trunk.

01:10:56.516 --> 01:10:58.905
Right away.

01:11:07.356 --> 01:11:09.347
Have a drink.

01:11:11.476 --> 01:11:14.036
Drink!

01:11:22.316 --> 01:11:24.705
(all laugh)

01:11:28.036 --> 01:11:31.711
The more I think about it,
it might be nice having you around here.

01:11:31.796 --> 01:11:35.152
And let those whores keep the old buzzard!

01:11:35.236 --> 01:11:37.227
Hey, boss.

01:11:37.316 --> 01:11:40.433
Not that one. The red one.

01:11:48.396 --> 01:11:50.956
Get up.

01:11:51.796 --> 01:11:53.787
Get up.

01:12:00.436 --> 01:12:03.348
Take your clothes off.

01:12:31.076 --> 01:12:33.715
Get in here.

01:12:50.756 --> 01:12:53.316
- Dammit, boss!
- You keep your ass in there!

01:12:53.396 --> 01:12:55.751
At least let us watch!

01:12:59.796 --> 01:13:01.787
Put it on.

01:13:36.836 --> 01:13:38.827
(spits)

01:14:03.996 --> 01:14:05.987
Ned!

01:14:07.316 --> 01:14:09.750
She's all yours.

01:14:26.476 --> 01:14:28.626
Hello, girlie.

01:14:30.836 --> 01:14:35.193
What do you say old Ned unties you
and we can have some fun, huh?

01:14:35.276 --> 01:14:37.915
You better kill me first,

01:14:37.996 --> 01:14:41.625
cos the only way I'd lay with you
is if I was dead.

01:14:42.636 --> 01:14:45.196
(explosions)

01:14:46.276 --> 01:14:48.710
(shouting)

01:15:15.196 --> 01:15:17.187
It's Josh!

01:15:17.876 --> 01:15:20.231
- Look again.
- Lilly?

01:15:20.316 --> 01:15:22.910
- Oh, Lilly!
- Lilly, I've been so worried about you.

01:15:22.996 --> 01:15:26.068
You should have seen it.
Bombs going off everywhere.

01:15:26.156 --> 01:15:30.195
Josh came and attacked Kid's place.
Got me out of there.

01:15:30.276 --> 01:15:33.507
I was ridin' out.
I looked behind me, but he wasn't there.

01:15:34.196 --> 01:15:37.666
- Where is he?
- I think they got him.

01:15:39.756 --> 01:15:41.747
Yah!

01:17:43.036 --> 01:17:46.392
- Where's the old man?
- Dead.

01:17:47.836 --> 01:17:51.988
That is a shame. What you gonna do now?

01:17:52.076 --> 01:17:53.634
Where's McCoy?

01:17:54.276 --> 01:17:56.153
Oh, him.

01:17:56.996 --> 01:17:59.032
He's here.

01:17:59.116 --> 01:18:02.472
But I wouldn't worry about him. He ain't dead.

01:18:02.556 --> 01:18:04.547
As yet.

01:18:07.716 --> 01:18:08.990
I'll buy him.

01:18:09.076 --> 01:18:11.510
You ain't got enough money
to buy him from me.

01:18:11.596 --> 01:18:13.826
You don't have a Gatling gun, do you?

01:18:13.916 --> 01:18:17.272
That is true. That is true.

01:18:22.476 --> 01:18:26.105
- Just show me the gun.
- Show me McCoy.

01:18:27.596 --> 01:18:29.587
!Trãelo!

01:18:35.676 --> 01:18:40.272
I've shown you mine. You show me yours.

01:18:47.476 --> 01:18:49.592
Can I offer you ladies a drink?

01:18:49.676 --> 01:18:52.144
(men laugh)

01:18:58.676 --> 01:19:00.667
Go get it.

01:19:04.636 --> 01:19:05.751
Kid!

01:19:17.916 --> 01:19:20.510
- And hurry up!
- Yeah, boss.

01:19:24.316 --> 01:19:26.307
Come on.

01:19:27.636 --> 01:19:29.194
Ha!

01:19:42.036 --> 01:19:44.470
Open that up. Let's see what we got there.

01:19:48.556 --> 01:19:51.434
Hey, Lilly. Welcome back.

01:19:57.796 --> 01:19:59.627
Yes! Yes!

01:20:04.236 --> 01:20:06.511
You want him?

01:20:09.876 --> 01:20:11.673
Take him.

01:20:22.916 --> 01:20:24.144
Josh.

01:20:46.356 --> 01:20:48.995
Josh.

01:20:56.716 --> 01:21:01.392
Oh, that's real sweet...
coming from a heartless whore.

01:21:08.436 --> 01:21:10.745
That's what you came for.

01:21:11.916 --> 01:21:15.067
Now get your ass outta here.

01:21:21.996 --> 01:21:25.033
Cody. Let's go.

01:21:46.156 --> 01:21:48.147
(Ned) Girlie.

01:21:48.236 --> 01:21:51.148
You come back and see old Ned, you hear?

01:21:51.236 --> 01:21:54.546
We'll finish what we got started.

01:21:54.636 --> 01:21:57.230
(makes kissing noises)

01:21:58.076 --> 01:21:59.475
(Ned laughs)

01:21:59.556 --> 01:22:00.989
Lilly.

01:22:08.356 --> 01:22:10.028
Split up!

01:22:31.956 --> 01:22:34.026
Cover me!

01:22:53.156 --> 01:22:54.191
Lilly!

01:23:18.916 --> 01:23:20.986
Cody. Here, here, here.

01:23:34.276 --> 01:23:35.504
(laughs)

01:23:53.996 --> 01:23:55.987
(laughs)

01:24:37.356 --> 01:24:39.745
Just foolin'.

01:24:39.836 --> 01:24:43.511
You don't think I'd shoot you in the back,
do you, darlin'?

01:24:43.596 --> 01:24:47.350
I'm out of bullets. I got no bullets.

01:25:04.796 --> 01:25:09.074
Pick it up. Put it in. Die like a man.

01:25:30.516 --> 01:25:33.076
You are a dumb whore.

01:27:48.716 --> 01:27:53.995
- Looks like you could use some help.
- You know, I reckon I could.

01:28:00.196 --> 01:28:02.187
You all set to go?

01:28:03.236 --> 01:28:05.227
I guess.

01:28:15.276 --> 01:28:19.747
Sure be mighty pleased
if you decided to stay on.

01:28:20.716 --> 01:28:22.707
Share this place.

01:28:28.516 --> 01:28:31.189
Oh. Well...

01:28:32.396 --> 01:28:36.833
William,
I think there's something I need to tell you.

01:28:36.916 --> 01:28:38.907
I know all about that.

01:28:40.676 --> 01:28:43.395
It's all in the past.
It don't matter to me, so you don't...

01:28:43.476 --> 01:28:47.185
I'm no lady from New Orleans.
My daddy was a poor rancher.

01:28:47.276 --> 01:28:52.225
Nearly worked himself to death
till the bank came and took it all away.

01:28:52.316 --> 01:28:58.630
I told myself
I'd get away from that damn dirt pile

01:28:58.716 --> 01:29:01.992
and marry me a rich gentleman.

01:29:05.116 --> 01:29:07.550
I was so stupid.

01:29:07.636 --> 01:29:12.027
AII I ever got was a couple of fancy dresses

01:29:13.036 --> 01:29:15.630
and a broken heart.

01:29:17.916 --> 01:29:20.066
I got this land.

01:29:21.276 --> 01:29:23.551
I ain't got no money.

01:29:24.556 --> 01:29:26.547
But I swear...

01:29:27.476 --> 01:29:29.467
I'll never break your heart.

01:29:39.916 --> 01:29:42.384
(laughs)

01:29:45.196 --> 01:29:46.709
Oh! That's my arm!

01:29:48.716 --> 01:29:52.868
- That's your share. You earned it.
- Consider it a wedding present.

01:29:52.956 --> 01:29:56.232
Oh. I got everything I need right here.

01:29:56.316 --> 01:29:58.910
But I'll take it.

01:30:01.236 --> 01:30:07.425
Well, the rest of it's here.
All except the $12,432 which belongs to us.

01:30:09.596 --> 01:30:13.225
You should stay.
When that money gets back to Agua Dulce,

01:30:13.316 --> 01:30:17.070
I expect you're all gonna be
pretty big heroes in these parts.

01:30:17.156 --> 01:30:19.545
Well, we ain't heroes.

01:30:21.396 --> 01:30:26.595
It's time to go. There's a certain gold mine
in the Klondike waiting on some hard work.

01:30:26.676 --> 01:30:28.667
That's a long way.

01:30:30.356 --> 01:30:33.348
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye, Sweetpea.

01:30:36.436 --> 01:30:38.028
See you.

01:30:38.116 --> 01:30:42.473
- Take good care of her.
- She's two handfuls, but I'll hang on.

01:30:48.876 --> 01:30:51.026
Eileen.

01:30:54.196 --> 01:30:56.756
Hey. You'll see her again.

01:30:56.836 --> 01:30:58.986
It ain't likely.

01:31:00.196 --> 01:31:02.187
I love you.

01:31:06.676 --> 01:31:08.792
(Cody) Let's ride.

01:31:15.396 --> 01:31:16.875
Shh.

01:31:18.196 --> 01:31:22.314
Lilly, I love you
all the way to the moon and back.

01:31:22.396 --> 01:31:24.785
And that's not gonna change.

01:31:58.636 --> 01:32:00.627
She killed a fella up in Colorado.

01:32:00.716 --> 01:32:04.709
I'm sorry, the only female I seen
in the last month is that mare over there.

01:32:04.796 --> 01:32:08.709
And she's startin' to look pretty good to me.
Ain't she, Tector?

01:32:08.796 --> 01:32:11.356
Hey, what's that you're drinking there?

01:32:11.436 --> 01:32:15.395
- Tennessee sippin' whiskey.
- Come on!

01:35:28.756 --> 01:35:32.112
