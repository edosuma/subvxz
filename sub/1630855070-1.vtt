There are no wrong answers.

00:53.619 --> 00:54.587
It's a persuasive essay.

00:54.620 --> 00:57.123
All you got to do is pick a side
and support it

00:57.156 --> 00:59.625
Well, that question
makes no sense.

00:59.658 --> 01:01.361
It's just exponential growth.

01:05.831 --> 01:08.468
I'm gonna go with A,
sadiated.

01:08.501 --> 01:10.203
I know
what exponential growth is,

01:10.236 --> 01:12.505
but nobody would make
an initial deposit of $3,000.

01:12.538 --> 01:13.339
It's way too low.

01:13.372 --> 01:17.210
Number 32,
what is the value of X?

I talked to my dad today.

28:54.499 --> 28:56.134
But I wouldn't get
your hopes up.

28:56.167 --> 28:56.568
Kinda hoping.

28:56.601 --> 28:57.535
I don't know.

28:57.568 --> 28:58.336
[Both laugh]

28:58.369 --> 29:00.171
Honestly.

29:00.204 --> 29:01.906
I always feel like I'm supposed
to like stop

29:01.939 --> 29:03.107
and do triceps dips there.

29:03.140 --> 29:04.275
No, no.

29:04.308 --> 29:04.976
I can never do.

29:05.009 --> 29:06.310
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

29:06.343 --> 29:07.779
You need to enjoy
being pregnant, enjoy this bod.

29:07.812 --> 29:08.346
Yeah.

29:08.379 --> 29:09.814
Eat what you want, girl.

29:09.847 --> 29:10.515
Don't work out.

29:10.548 --> 29:11.282
Yeah.

29:11.315 --> 29:12.417
Ethan will love it.

29:15.085 --> 29:15.887
What?

29:15.920 --> 29:18.289
[Anne clears throat]

29:18.322 --> 29:19.791
Nothing.

29:19.824 --> 29:20.391
I don't know.

29:20.425 --> 29:23.861
I'm just obsessing again.

29:23.894 --> 29:24.829
Sculptor girl?

29:24.862 --> 29:26.030
Yeah.

29:26.063 --> 29:27.431
I don't know.

29:27.464 --> 29:29.901
Maybe it's the hormones,
but it's just-- I'm still angry.

29:29.934 --> 29:31.035
-You know what I mean?
-Yeah, yeah.

29:31.069 --> 29:32.503
It's just-- it's so fucking
cliché like, hooking up

29:32.536 --> 29:33.437
at an artists' retreat?

29:33.470 --> 29:34.071
Really?

29:34.104 --> 29:34.738
I know.

29:34.772 --> 29:37.041
It makes sense to be angry.

29:37.074 --> 29:38.976
It's like everything changes
when you have a kid.

29:39.009 --> 29:39.977
He's not just your husband
anymore,

29:40.010 --> 29:41.112
he's the father of your child.

29:41.145 --> 29:42.380
Yeah.

29:42.413 --> 29:45.216
Well, I mean, we're not married.

29:45.249 --> 29:45.983
But, but I hear you.

29:46.016 --> 29:46.884
Okay.

29:46.917 --> 29:48.253
[Both laugh]

29:53.591 --> 29:55.092
Hey.

29:55.125 --> 29:56.828
Yeah?

29:56.861 --> 29:58.296
I talked to my dad.

29:58.329 --> 30:00.331
[Grunts]

30:01.599 --> 30:04.402
He said we can have
a special dinner tomorrow

30:04.435 --> 30:07.605
to celebrate the final session.

30:07.638 --> 30:10.074
He gets in by early evening.

30:10.107 --> 30:12.443
Well, we hardly did
any work today.

30:12.476 --> 30:14.278
Well, he doesn't know that.

30:14.311 --> 30:16.548
He's excited to meet you.

30:18.582 --> 30:20.885
I have to leave right
after our session.

30:20.918 --> 30:24.088
Come on!
Just stay a little.

30:24.121 --> 30:25.056
You're so cool.

30:25.089 --> 30:26.390
I-- I want to get to know you.

30:26.423 --> 30:28.926
Jackson, this is a job.
Okay?

30:28.959 --> 30:30.228
I don't know what
you thought it was,

30:30.261 --> 30:31.896
but I'm your tutor.

30:31.929 --> 30:34.899
I'm not your friend.
Okay?

30:35.599 --> 30:37.368
Have a good night.

31:03.627 --> 31:05.963
Jackson?

31:05.996 --> 31:14.906
[♪♪♪]

31:22.947 --> 31:24.949
Jackson?

31:28.485 --> 31:30.922
Jackson?

31:30.955 --> 31:39.664
[♪♪♪]

31:45.069 --> 31:47.338
Jackson?

31:47.371 --> 31:56.281
[♪♪♪]

32:02.386 --> 32:11.296
[♪♪♪]

32:17.401 --> 32:26.311
[♪♪♪]

32:32.416 --> 32:41.326
[♪♪♪]

33:03.080 --> 33:05.282
Which problem are you on?

33:05.315 --> 33:07.051
We only have two hours
left today,

33:07.084 --> 33:08.285
and I want to
get some good work done.

33:08.318 --> 33:09.253
Okay?

33:09.286 --> 33:12.156
Okay. Okay.

33:15.159 --> 33:16.627
Look, hey, just relax.

33:16.660 --> 33:17.695
Relax.

33:17.728 --> 33:19.497
Just breathe.

33:19.530 --> 33:21.566
Calm down.

33:29.073 --> 33:32.043
Look, I'm sorry about yesterday.

33:32.076 --> 33:34.211
I didn't mean to upset you.

33:34.244 --> 33:36.313
But I do have to get home.

33:36.346 --> 33:38.716
I have plans with my girlfriend.

33:41.819 --> 33:44.122
Okay.

33:47.691 --> 33:49.226
And I do think that you formed

33:49.259 --> 33:53.064
a slightly unhealthy
attachment to me.

33:58.535 --> 34:01.105
I just want to get to know you.

34:01.138 --> 34:02.239
What's wrong with that?

34:02.272 --> 34:04.742
I saw the pictures
on your computer.

34:07.444 --> 34:08.813
You shouldn't be on my computer.

34:08.846 --> 34:10.681
I know.

34:10.714 --> 34:15.420
I came to find you last night
to apologize, to say I'm sorry.

34:17.888 --> 34:20.324
No.

34:21.792 --> 34:24.462
I'm sorry.

34:27.197 --> 34:29.734
Do you want to talk about it?

34:34.705 --> 34:35.539
I think if we--

34:35.572 --> 34:38.476
[Jackson yells, grunts]

34:39.543 --> 34:41.378
Jackson.

34:41.411 --> 34:42.613
Hey, Jackson.

34:42.646 --> 34:46.383
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Jackson! Hey, stop!

34:46.416 --> 34:47.485
[Yelling]

34:47.518 --> 34:48.486
Stop, stop, stop.

34:48.519 --> 34:50.754
[Yelling]

34:50.787 --> 34:52.356
Hey, stop it.

34:54.158 --> 34:56.127
[Jackson grunts]

34:56.160 --> 34:58.629
Jackson.

34:58.662 --> 35:00.464
Jackson!

35:00.497 --> 35:02.433
Jackson?

35:02.466 --> 35:05.469
Jackson!

35:05.502 --> 35:07.805
Hello.

35:09.773 --> 35:12.510
You must be Jackson's father.

35:12.543 --> 35:13.411
Well...

35:19.283 --> 35:23.321
I'm sorry,
he's an emotional kid.

35:23.687 --> 35:24.855
Yeah.

35:24.888 --> 35:28.559
Uh, you know, he was doing great
and then--

35:28.592 --> 35:30.327
and just all of a sudden
he got--

35:30.360 --> 35:30.828
Upset.

35:30.861 --> 35:32.930
Yeah.

35:32.963 --> 35:35.232
You know how they prep soldiers
for target practice

35:35.265 --> 35:37.268
in World War II?

35:37.301 --> 35:38.335
I do not.

35:38.368 --> 35:39.570
They'd spin them around
in circles

35:39.603 --> 35:41.372
until they got dizzy.

35:41.405 --> 35:45.877
And then-- then they'd make ‘em
fire their weapons.

35:47.644 --> 35:49.680
Don't go easy on him.

35:49.713 --> 35:53.450
He has to be able
to perform at all times.

35:53.483 --> 35:55.653
I found that out the hard way.

35:56.887 --> 35:58.956
Hey, sorry, I'm not gonna be
able to make it

35:58.989 --> 36:01.725
to dinner tonight.

36:01.758 --> 36:03.694
That's okay.

36:03.727 --> 36:05.329
Oh, okay.

36:08.232 --> 36:11.202
It's a beautiful painting.

36:11.235 --> 36:13.270
You can have it.

36:13.303 --> 36:13.737
[Chuckles]

36:13.770 --> 36:14.738
Come on.

36:14.771 --> 36:15.973
Seriously.

36:16.006 --> 36:18.776
We've got three more
around here somewhere.

36:29.353 --> 36:30.054
Hey, Chris.

36:30.087 --> 36:32.323
Ethan.
Nailed the presentation.

36:32.356 --> 36:34.525
Montclair, New Jersey,
it's gonna be a goldmine.

36:34.558 --> 36:35.326
<i> ETHAN (ON PHONE):
Chris, listen.</i>

36:35.359 --> 36:36.627
No, you listen.

36:36.660 --> 36:38.629
I just got a phone call
from Jackson's father.

36:38.662 --> 36:39.797
<i> ETHAN (ON PHONE):
Yeah, before
you say anything--</i>

36:39.830 --> 36:42.933
They want you to continue
through the summer, my main man.

36:42.966 --> 36:44.067
They think it'd be good
for Jackson

36:44.101 --> 36:45.903
to have someone around,
you know, keep him company.

36:45.936 --> 36:49.473
I-- I don't know, man.

36:49.506 --> 36:52.009
<i> CHRIS (ON PHONE):
They're offering you triple
your day rate moving forward.</i>

36:52.042 --> 36:53.611
<i> Chaching!</i>

36:53.644 --> 36:55.579
<i> Make your year in a month.</i>

36:55.612 --> 36:58.315
Oh, Chris.

36:58.348 --> 37:00.384
<i> CHRIS (ON PHONE):
You're welcome.</i>

37:03.854 --> 37:05.623
<i> I'll take that as a yes.</i>

37:05.656 --> 37:11.662
So, we found out the sex.

37:13.830 --> 37:15.399
Don't pause like that.

37:15.432 --> 37:16.533
Come on!

37:16.566 --> 37:17.968
[Laugh]

37:18.001 --> 37:21.972
We are having...
a boy.

37:22.005 --> 37:22.639
[Miriam gasps]

37:22.673 --> 37:24.408
We're having a little Ethan.

37:24.441 --> 37:27.544
Yes! Oh, I knew it, I so knew
it was gonna be a boy.

37:27.577 --> 37:28.545
Yeah.

37:28.578 --> 37:31.315
Whoo!

37:31.348 --> 37:32.616
I'm not cheering the boy part,
specifically.

37:32.649 --> 37:33.951
I would have cheered
either way.

37:33.984 --> 37:34.785
He's very woke.

37:34.818 --> 37:35.920
You do?

37:36.953 --> 37:37.621
Congrats, you guys.

37:37.654 --> 37:39.356
Oh, we're so excited for you.

37:39.389 --> 37:39.823
That's amazing.

37:39.856 --> 37:40.691
Thank you.

37:40.724 --> 37:42.026
We're really excited.

37:42.059 --> 37:46.497
Um, we have an announcement
to make, too.

37:48.899 --> 37:51.569
Ah, we're moving to Portland.

37:53.870 --> 37:56.440
Wow! Okay.

37:56.473 --> 37:58.075
So, it's really happening.

37:58.108 --> 37:59.476
JOSH:
Yeah.

37:59.509 --> 38:00.411
MIRIAM:
Hey, um,
we are not going to leave

38:00.444 --> 38:01.645
until the baby is born.

38:01.678 --> 38:03.781
I would never do that to you.

38:03.814 --> 38:04.415
JOSH:
Yeah.

38:04.448 --> 38:05.482
Oh my gosh.

38:05.515 --> 38:06.717
I'm gonna miss you guys so much.

38:06.750 --> 38:08.452
MIRIAM:
Ah, I'm sorry.

38:08.485 --> 38:09.019
It's okay.

38:09.052 --> 38:10.354
MIRIAM:
I'm sorry.

38:10.387 --> 38:11.488
It's okay.
It's okay.

38:11.521 --> 38:12.823
I can't say that
I didn't see it coming.

38:12.856 --> 38:15.059
Hey, how's-- how's work?

38:15.092 --> 38:17.528
I bet you got some crazy shit.

38:18.862 --> 38:23.467
Yeah, but I put up with it,
because the pay is good.

38:23.500 --> 38:26.937
Well, tell them my favorite one.

38:26.970 --> 38:28.605
Oh, which one?

38:28.638 --> 38:29.440
Oh, you know.

38:29.473 --> 38:31.909
[All laugh]

38:31.942 --> 38:33.411
MIRIAM:
Tell us.

38:36.680 --> 38:40.984
Oh, the one where the girl uh--

38:41.017 --> 38:43.020
the girl threw her textbook
at me...

38:43.053 --> 38:44.521
-...and called me “white trash”.
-White trash.

38:44.554 --> 38:45.622
-Mm-hmm.
-MIRIAM: Oh my God.

38:45.655 --> 38:46.123
ANNIE:
Yes.

38:46.156 --> 38:47.825
[Miriam laughs]

38:47.858 --> 38:51.929
And the Russian oligarch that
flew me to London

38:51.962 --> 38:54.698
to take his son
on a college tour

38:54.731 --> 38:58.502
and the father that screamed
at me to not tell him

38:58.535 --> 39:02.639
how to raise his fucking kid--

39:02.672 --> 39:04.742
Yeah.

39:04.775 --> 39:07.010
Um...

39:07.043 --> 39:09.913
Annie said you have
a new student who's, oh,

39:09.946 --> 39:11.615
interesting, I guess.

39:11.648 --> 39:12.916
Yeah.

39:12.949 --> 39:18.055
He's um--
yeah, he's interesting.

39:18.088 --> 39:23.827
He's um, obsessed with me.

39:23.860 --> 39:29.566
He's a-- in a total stalker
sort of way.

39:29.599 --> 39:33.437
You know,
"Ethan, you're so cool."

39:33.470 --> 39:36.039
"Man, you really listen."

39:36.072 --> 39:40.177
And he starts waving money
in front of my face

39:40.210 --> 39:42.713
at any moment
like he can fucking buy me...

39:42.746 --> 39:43.547
-...like I'm--
-MIRIAM: Okay.

39:43.580 --> 39:46.884
Some kind of whore.

39:46.917 --> 39:50.954
He had pictures of Annie and I
on his laptop.

39:50.987 --> 39:52.823
And then we're working
on a section

39:52.856 --> 39:56.794
and he makes one mistake
and he starts flipping out

39:56.827 --> 39:59.930
in some sort of--
sort of a psychotic like,

39:59.963 --> 40:02.666
bipolar episode.

40:02.699 --> 40:05.135
He's such a weird little kid
that I don't know how

40:05.168 --> 40:06.637
he lives with himself.

40:06.670 --> 40:07.070
Ethan?

40:07.103 --> 40:07.771
Huh?

40:07.804 --> 40:09.507
We get it.

40:11.141 --> 40:13.944
Jackson.

40:13.977 --> 40:16.013
ETHAN:
Hey.

40:16.046 --> 40:18.916
We were just talking
about someone else.

40:18.949 --> 40:21.618
No big deal.

40:21.651 --> 40:24.555
ANNIE:
Jackson, hi, I'm-- I'm Annie.

40:24.588 --> 40:26.824
Ethan--
Ethan's told me a lot about you.

40:26.857 --> 40:28.459
Uh, you like this place?

40:28.492 --> 40:30.627
I-- I think the food here
is divine.

40:30.660 --> 40:31.862
Mmm.

40:31.895 --> 40:32.963
Yeah, it's good.

40:32.996 --> 40:36.667
It's um, it's expensive.

40:36.700 --> 40:37.568
Good.

40:39.903 --> 40:42.840
What are you doing
out here so late?

40:42.873 --> 40:45.542
Well, I'm 17, Ethan.

40:45.575 --> 40:46.677
I have a life.

40:46.710 --> 40:48.879
[Laughs]

40:48.912 --> 40:50.113
Of course.

40:50.146 --> 40:52.783
My family owns three
buildings on this block.

40:52.816 --> 40:54.785
We're here on weekends.

40:55.285 --> 40:58.556
Oh.

I don't know how to judge you.

58:07.650 --> 58:08.618

anything about me.

Oh, I don't?

You stay away from my family.

Ethan, do you have a much
experience waiting tables?

I just see a lot of tutoring

59:43.912 --> 59:45.681
It's probably his cousin, Gavin.

59:45.714 --> 59:47.350
That's who you should
be questioning.

But then I think about your dad
and I think about--

1:00:31.994 --> 1:00:32.762
I'm not my dad.

1:00:32.795 --> 1:00:34.363

And I don't want to be stressed

1:00:36.065 --> 1:00:37.266
It's-- it's not good

I don't understand

1:00:47.476 --> 1:00:49.345
ANNIE:
Who is she?

1:00:52.247 --> 1:00:58.187
Jackson told me at the station
that he's worried about me.

1:00:58.220 --> 1:00:59.321
Why?

1:00:59.354 --> 1:01:00.356
He-- he told me that
his mother's name

1:01:00.389 --> 1:01:02.124
was Rachel Platt.

1:01:02.157 --> 1:01:04.260

His mother?

1:01:06.128 --> 1:01:08.831
He said that she was murdered.

1:01:08.864 --> 1:01:11.367
Murdered?

1:01:11.400 --> 1:01:13.703
I looked it up and a decade ago
a woman named Rachel Platt

1:01:13.736 --> 1:01:15.772
drowned in the lake.

1:01:17.372 --> 1:01:19.375
Yeah, I know.

1:01:21.210 --> 1:01:23.946

Okay. So what does this woman
have to do with you, Ethan?

1:01:28.817 --> 1:01:31.721

1:01:37.459 --> 1:01:39.262
We dated.

1:01:40.996 --> 1:01:43.132
It was just a fling.

1:01:47.970 --> 1:01:51.407
And she wasn't murdered here.

1:01:51.440 --> 1:01:54.110
She committed suicide.

1:01:56.411 --> 1:02:00.216
I always thought her son's
name was Christopher.

1:02:02.451 --> 1:02:06.188
So, you were having an affair?

1:02:06.221 --> 1:02:09.859
No, it wasn't an affair.

1:02:09.892 --> 1:02:14.397
They basically weren't
even together anymore.

1:02:18.233 --> 1:02:20.069
He didn't care about her.

1:02:23.172 --> 1:02:27.042
Oh.

1:02:27.075 --> 1:02:29.311
Poor Jackson.

1:02:29.344 --> 1:02:35.151
Poor Jackson then,
but now he's fucking crazy.

1:02:35.184 --> 1:02:37.987
I mean, if he thinks
that she was murdered,

1:02:38.020 --> 1:02:39.855
he probably thinks I had
something to do with that.

1:02:39.888 --> 1:02:42.125
That's why he's trying to ruin
both of our lives.

1:02:48.230 --> 1:02:50.800
Why didn't you tell me?

1:02:52.935 --> 1:02:54.370
I didn't want to relive it.

1:02:54.403 --> 1:02:57.239

to bring that up to you?

1:03:04.880 --> 1:03:07.483
She was crazy, Annie.

1:03:09.518 --> 1:03:11.921
Jackson probably inherited it.

1:03:14.857 --> 1:03:18.127
That's why he's so fucked up.

1:03:18.160 --> 1:03:20.262
ANNIE:
Of course, he's fucked up.

1:03:20.295 --> 1:03:22.364
He's been traumatized.

1:03:22.397 --> 1:03:26.435

oh.

1:03:29.104 --> 1:03:30.873

you let me know.

Whose death you were questioned
about exactly 10 years ago?

1:10:44.339 --> 1:10:45.607
And I had nothing to do with it.

1:10:45.640 --> 1:10:46.975
That's what I'm trying
to tell you, guys.

1:10:47.008 --> 1:10:50.479
This kid had some fixation.

1:10:50.512 --> 1:10:53.915
He had some idea.

1:10:53.948 --> 1:10:56.285
Ask his father.

1:10:58.019 --> 1:11:01.557
DETECTIVE LANDRY:
Jefferson Platt died from
cancer three years ago, Ethan.

1:11:06.094 --> 1:11:09.531
Why did your tutoring company
let you go?

1:11:15.603 --> 1:11:22.644
Because they accused me
of um, assaulting him.

1:11:22.677 --> 1:11:26.848
DETECTIVE LANDRY:
So, that's twice you've been
accused of assaulting Jackson.

1:11:26.881 --> 1:11:29.484
I'm gonna have to ask you
not to leave the area

1:11:29.517 --> 1:11:32.554
for a few days.

1:11:32.587 --> 1:11:35.524
We're gonna wanna talk to you
some more.

1:11:35.557 --> 1:11:37.959
Okay.

1:11:37.992 --> 1:11:40.696
Yeah, I wouldn't do anything
now, because...

1:11:48.737 --> 1:11:50.472
I just want my life back.

1:11:55.910 --> 1:11:58.647
I just want my life back.

How was your evening, Ethan?</i>

1:12:23.505 --> 1:12:24.573
Splendid.

1:12:24.606 --> 1:12:27.075
I've lost everything
thanks to you.

1:12:27.108 --> 1:12:28.076
<i> JACKSON (ON PHONE):
So have I.</i>

1:12:28.109 --> 1:12:28.977
<i> Thanks to you.</i>

1:12:29.010 --> 1:12:30.145
Listen--

1:12:30.178 --> 1:12:32.047
<i> JACKSON (ON PHONE):
No, you listen.</i>

1:12:32.080 --> 1:12:33.148
<i> I wanna talk.</i>

1:12:33.181 --> 1:12:36.451
No, I-- I give up.

1:12:36.484 --> 1:12:38.086
I don't want anything
to do with you.

1:12:38.119 --> 1:12:40.055
All right? Just leave me alone.

1:12:40.088 --> 1:12:42.591

unless you prefer</i>

1:12:42.624 --> 1:12:45.127

1:13:58.600 --> 1:14:05.140
This was her favorite place,
where she felt most at peace.

1:14:05.173 --> 1:14:07.042
But you already knew that.

1:14:08.676 --> 1:14:11.713
Her body washed up
2 miles downstream.

1:14:11.746 --> 1:14:13.949
But they didn't find
water in her lungs.

1:14:13.982 --> 1:14:18.253
So someone killed her
and then pushed her in.

1:14:18.286 --> 1:14:21.523
That was one theory along
with many others.

1:14:21.556 --> 1:14:25.894
The heel from her shoe snapped
off and lodged right there.

1:14:25.927 --> 1:14:29.197
Her head was slammed against
the deck with such force

1:14:29.230 --> 1:14:31.833
that it cracked the wood.

1:14:31.866 --> 1:14:35.170
The police determined that that
was the exact spot

1:14:35.203 --> 1:14:37.906
that she died.

1:14:37.939 --> 1:14:40.842
Detectives put that
in their confidential report.

1:14:40.875 --> 1:14:43.278
My father got a copy, of course.

1:14:43.311 --> 1:14:47.949
And so only he, myself,
and the murderer knows

1:14:47.982 --> 1:14:50.752
that was the exact spot.

1:14:50.785 --> 1:14:51.953
And here you are.

1:14:51.986 --> 1:14:53.855
Oh, that's bullshit!

1:14:53.888 --> 1:14:55.223
It only makes sense
this is where she died.

1:14:55.256 --> 1:14:57.626
It's your property.

1:14:57.659 --> 1:14:59.594
The current runs straight
to where she was found.

1:14:59.627 --> 1:15:01.096
It doesn't take a genius to
figure out this is

1:15:01.129 --> 1:15:03.164
where she killed herself.

1:15:03.197 --> 1:15:05.667
Where are you going?

1:15:12.106 --> 1:15:14.175
I want closure, Ethan.

1:15:14.208 --> 1:15:17.612
I am sorry for your loss.

1:15:17.645 --> 1:15:19.114
But your mom and I's
relationship,

1:15:19.147 --> 1:15:20.949
it was a mistake.

1:15:20.982 --> 1:15:22.851
And her death?

1:15:22.884 --> 1:15:25.287
I had nothing to do with it.
Okay?

1:15:25.320 --> 1:15:26.655
I promise!

1:15:26.688 --> 1:15:29.291
I guess if you tell
a lie long enough,

1:15:29.324 --> 1:15:31.626
then you just start
to believe it.

1:16:00.254 --> 1:16:00.955
You know what?

1:16:00.988 --> 1:16:02.658
Let's stick to the plan,
Jackson.

1:16:04.926 --> 1:16:07.762
He's waking up.

1:16:07.795 --> 1:16:10.865
GAVIN:
Okay. Stay down, unless he
asks you a fucking question.

1:16:10.898 --> 1:16:13.168
Hey, Jackson, can we kill him?

1:16:13.201 --> 1:16:14.736
Let's-- let's just call
the police.

1:16:14.769 --> 1:16:17.906
It was just an affair.

1:16:17.939 --> 1:16:20.008
[Grunts]

1:16:20.041 --> 1:16:22.110
I know you blamed me for what
happened to your mom,

1:16:22.143 --> 1:16:24.312
but we weren't even seeing
each other anymore.

1:16:24.345 --> 1:16:26.214
You were with her that night.

1:16:26.247 --> 1:16:27.248
No, I wasn't.

1:16:27.281 --> 1:16:30.852
Bullshit!

1:16:30.885 --> 1:16:33.989
You don't know what it was like
stuck at that awful

1:16:34.022 --> 1:16:35.357
boarding school.

1:16:35.390 --> 1:16:37.025
She was the only one that
ever gave a shit about me.

1:16:37.058 --> 1:16:39.027
Okay, I talked to her. Okay?

1:16:39.060 --> 1:16:40.829
Say her name.

1:16:40.862 --> 1:16:44.766
Rachel, I talked to her
on the phone that night.

1:16:44.799 --> 1:16:46.201
Maybe an hour before she died.

1:16:46.234 --> 1:16:48.203
She was sad about
our relationship ending.

1:16:48.236 --> 1:16:49.871
She was drunk,
but I didn't come here.

1:16:49.904 --> 1:16:52.374
I knew it'd be a mistake.

1:16:52.407 --> 1:16:55.644
JACKSON:
The autopsy showed
she was pregnant.

1:16:55.677 --> 1:16:57.846
It was gonna be a boy.

1:16:59.447 --> 1:17:01.116
I wouldn't be alone.

1:17:01.149 --> 1:17:04.286
We know it wasn't his dad,
because they weren't fucking.

1:17:09.957 --> 1:17:11.726
He's not gonna tell the truth.

1:17:11.759 --> 1:17:12.727
Fine.

1:17:12.760 --> 1:17:13.762
Let's kill him.

1:17:13.795 --> 1:17:16.131
No, fine! Okay!

1:17:19.067 --> 1:17:20.969
Okay.

1:17:25.273 --> 1:17:27.976
I was with her,

1:17:28.009 --> 1:17:30.278
but I wasn't there
when she died.

1:17:33.247 --> 1:17:37.085
I begged her for one more night
and she agreed.

1:17:38.352 --> 1:17:41.823
We took a bottle of wine
to the docks to our spot,

1:17:41.856 --> 1:17:44.125
and we made love.

1:17:44.158 --> 1:17:47.228
And after,
she didn't want it to end,

1:17:47.261 --> 1:17:51.199
because she loved me.

1:17:51.232 --> 1:17:53.001
Her husband gave her
an ultimatum.

1:17:53.034 --> 1:17:54.969
He said she couldn't
leave her family.

1:17:55.002 --> 1:17:57.138
She couldn't leave you.

1:17:57.171 --> 1:17:59.107
And so, she got hysterical.

1:17:59.140 --> 1:18:02.044
But I didn't-- I didn't think
she'd hurt herself.

1:18:05.113 --> 1:18:08.717
Jackson, come on,
I think about it every day

1:18:08.750 --> 1:18:11.720
what would've happened
had I just fucking stayed here.

1:18:11.753 --> 1:18:15.991
I mean, I...

1:18:18.793 --> 1:18:21.229

1:18:25.833 --> 1:18:30.472

I'm so sorry.

ETHAN:
Uh, no, it's not.

1:18:35.810 --> 1:18:41.850
I blamed myself for years
and then I found the things

1:18:41.883 --> 1:18:44.953
she left behind.

1:18:44.986 --> 1:18:48.289
She wrote about you
in her diary.

1:18:48.322 --> 1:18:51.226
She was scared.

1:18:51.259 --> 1:18:53.928
She said you seemed unstable.

1:18:53.961 --> 1:18:57.766
And then suddenly,
it made sense to me.

1:18:57.799 --> 1:19:02.304
It had never been my fault,
and I knew what I needed to do.

1:19:04.238 --> 1:19:06.408
What do you want from me?

1:19:08.342 --> 1:19:10.445
It wasn't an accident.

1:19:10.478 --> 1:19:12.947

what was between us was real,

1:19:20.154 --> 1:19:22.524
that I loved her?

1:19:22.557 --> 1:19:26.094
Well, she didn't feel the same.

1:19:26.127 --> 1:19:31.032
She said you were
a pathetic puppy dog.

why you wouldn't stop.

1:25:10.237 --> 1:25:12.540
No, I don't.

1:25:14.842 --> 1:25:20.748
We were good, just you and I.

1:25:22.750 --> 1:25:26.687
We were good together.

1:25:26.720 --> 1:25:29.224
But now you know too much.

1:25:34.528 --> 1:25:36.364

No.

1:25:37.965 --> 1:25:40.935
No.

1:25:40.968 --> 1:25:42.904
You're a monster.

Why didn't you tell me
what he did?

1:27:40.521 --> 1:27:43.891
I should've.

1:27:43.924 --> 1:27:49.764
But I needed to find out
for myself.

1:27:58.072 --> 1:28:01.809
You can spend your entire life
with someone,

1:28:01.842 --> 1:28:04.946
and never know who
they really are.

1:28:10.651 --> 1:28:13.721
ETHAN:
For me, it's about connection.

1:28:13.754 --> 1:28:19.360
Helps to identify and relate
to the walls and barriers that

1:28:19.393 --> 1:28:23.464
could potentially be blocking
each particular student.

1:28:23.497 --> 1:28:28.402
A simple solution can go
a long way.

1:28:28.435 --> 1:28:32.406
Not just in education,
but in life.

1:28:32.439 --> 1:28:38.112
Most importantly,
you've got to love what you do.

1:28:38.145 --> 1:28:44.518
Understand that
each student's journey

1:28:44.551 --> 1:28:48.589
has its own unique reward.
