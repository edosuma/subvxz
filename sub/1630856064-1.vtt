00:23.314 --> 00:25.817
<i>homemaker, unemployed, comedian,
it really makes no difference.</i>

00:25.817 --> 00:28.653
There comes a time, and I think
it's when we get out of school

00:28.653 --> 00:32.282
and begin... well, let's say,
begin to work within reality.

00:32.282 --> 00:37.328
He's one of the most
original thinkers that will...

00:37.328 --> 00:40.165
we've ever seen
and will ever see.

00:40.165 --> 00:43.793
We look into ourselves,
all of us, and we say,

00:43.793 --> 00:46.129
"How much talent
do I really have?"

00:46.129 --> 00:47.297
You know that feeling?

00:47.297 --> 00:51.217
I didn't realize
someone could be funny that way.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.303
In other words,
"Do I really have enough

00:53.303 --> 00:55.472
to get me
through an entire life?"

00:55.472 --> 00:58.058
Always something,
like, just different.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.894
"Will I become
an actual old person

01:00.894 --> 01:03.313
that I see walking
on the street now? Me?

01:03.313 --> 01:05.190
And what kind of an old person
will I become?"

01:05.190 --> 01:06.358
That's very important.

01:06.358 --> 01:09.235
"Will I be someone
who's loved and respected

01:09.235 --> 01:13.031
and known to have led an honest,
positive kind of life?"

01:13.031 --> 01:16.701
He was the first kind
of alternative comic.

01:16.701 --> 01:18.870
We know what talent
we're starting out with

01:18.870 --> 01:21.456
and we devise a game plan.

01:21.456 --> 01:23.583
A game plan for living,
so to speak.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.710
I don't think
there's anybody like him.

01:26.378 --> 01:29.130
Where do I fit into all of this?

01:31.216 --> 01:33.510
My game plan is all off.

01:34.886 --> 01:36.888
Here I am,
five years into my career,

01:36.888 --> 01:38.765
I have no more material left.

01:42.185 --> 01:44.979
He was speaking directly to me.

01:44.979 --> 01:46.398
I could've fooled you
to get laughs,

01:46.398 --> 01:47.899
but that's not
what it's all about.

01:47.899 --> 01:49.317
I'm trying
to be honest with you.

01:49.317 --> 01:51.736
And what, I couldn't resort
to cheap tricks? Come on.

01:51.736 --> 01:54.239
I could drop my pants as easy
as anyone in the business.

01:54.239 --> 01:55.907

What? Boom.

01:55.907 --> 01:58.451
Right? Okay.

01:59.452 --> 02:01.413
I can get the comedy shorts
from Sears.

02:01.413 --> 02:03.331
I can stop a makeup man
in the hall and say,

02:03.331 --> 02:05.417
"Do me a favor. Draw a funny,
uh, face on my chest."

02:05.417 --> 02:07.419
You know what I mean?

02:07.419 --> 02:09.462
He was like a...
he was like a comedic tornado.

02:09.462 --> 02:12.757
Can I buy a pie?
You bet your life I can.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.052
I can break eggs on my head
as easily as anyone

02:16.052 --> 02:17.095
in the business.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.346
But that's not
what I'm all about.

02:18.346 --> 02:20.265
If I was all about that,
I'd go out and get seltzer.

02:20.265 --> 02:22.934
What? I can do this all day.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.894
And put whipped cream
all over me.

02:27.605 --> 02:28.773
Because this...

02:29.816 --> 02:34.154
...this isn't me.
It's not the real me.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.346
He's different.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.639
He... he has a great sense

just about anything.

"I know Carl Reiner."

05:16.608 --> 05:19.319

06:02.404 --> 06:03.697
Right. So--
But here's the thing,

06:03.697 --> 06:06.908
your father, Harry Einstein...
Mm-hmm.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.910
...he had four sons.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.537
<i>You have a half-brother...
Charles.</i>

<i>...Charlie,
who was a sportswriter.</i>

06:12.539 --> 06:14.165
<i>Mm-hmm.
Then he had Cliff</i>

06:14.165 --> 06:15.291
<i>and then Bob. Bob.</i>

06:15.291 --> 06:16.501
<i>And then you.
And, yes.</i>

06:16.501 --> 06:20.714
So, he had three chances
before you were born...

06:20.714 --> 06:21.506
Mm-hmm.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.925
...to name one
of his sons Albert.

06:23.925 --> 06:26.594
He was waiting to see
if the theory of relativity

06:26.594 --> 06:28.430
would be proven wrong.

06:28.430 --> 06:30.557
- And once--
- And once I was born,

06:30.557 --> 06:32.392
it looked like it was for real.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.685
It's for real?
- Yeah.

06:33.685 --> 06:35.395
He figured, "Okay, it's safe."
Yeah, yeah.

06:35.395 --> 06:37.897
So you're the one
that gets stuck with that.

06:37.897 --> 06:40.066
Right. He did name my brother
"Adolf Hitler"

06:40.066 --> 06:41.901
but they wouldn't put it
on the birth certificate.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.194
I see. Yeah.

06:45.238 --> 06:48.158

"Albert Einstein."

to get beaten up for lunch money

06:51.119 --> 06:52.746

06:52.746 --> 06:54.831

06:54.831 --> 06:57.167
<i>'cause she never

<i>She would give you wine

"It's vinegar, Mom."
"It's very good wine."

07:10.305 --> 07:11.556

you know?"

"A 16-year-old high school kid
named Albert Einstein."

07:34.954 --> 07:36.623
Yeah.
And, you know, that was

07:36.623 --> 07:38.917
on <i>The Johnny Carson Show.</i>
Right, right.

07:38.917 --> 07:40.877
<i>Thanks to my son, Rob,</i>

07:40.877 --> 07:43.880
<i>who was Albert's friend
and teenage schoolmate,</i>

07:43.880 --> 07:48.176
<i>I was privileged to be present
when he exhibited a talent</i>

07:48.176 --> 07:50.637
<i>we had no idea he possessed.</i>

07:50.637 --> 07:52.472
I know the story about how, like,

07:52.472 --> 07:54.849
when he's young
and he did the...

07:54.849 --> 07:57.519
the-- Like, behind
the curtain trick with your dad

07:57.519 --> 07:59.604
and all that famous story.
Oh, yeah. He was 16.

07:59.604 --> 08:02.107
And out of the blue,
you said-- you said,

08:02.107 --> 08:07.153
um, "I've been working
on this escape artist routine.

08:07.153 --> 08:08.488
I think I've perfected it.

08:08.488 --> 08:12.742
I'm like the best escape artist
of all time."

08:12.742 --> 08:15.578
And I think you had--
you had like this or something.

08:15.578 --> 08:16.830
Yeah. A napkin.
It was like a--

08:16.830 --> 08:18.581
I said, "Put it over my hands."
A napkin.

08:18.581 --> 08:19.624
"Put it over my hands."

08:19.624 --> 08:21.084
I said,
"You don't have to tie it."

08:21.084 --> 08:22.252
All right. That's good enough.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.420
Okay. Yeah.
That's good enough.

08:23.420 --> 08:24.546
He says, "I can't get out of--"

08:24.546 --> 08:25.797
"I can't get out of this."

08:25.797 --> 08:27.090
"Can't get out of that."

08:27.090 --> 08:29.300
And then you had me put,
or somebody put--

08:29.300 --> 08:30.969
I stuffed some Kleenex
in my mouth.

08:30.969 --> 08:32.971
And the fact that you could
breathe out of your nose.

08:32.971 --> 08:34.764
Well, the fact that
I could take it out.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.808
Take it out. Yeah.
- Nothing was tied.

08:36.808 --> 08:40.520
So then, with that,
you go behind a curtain.

08:40.520 --> 08:41.896
Yeah.

08:41.896 --> 08:43.481
You say you're gonna get out
from behind the curtain...

08:43.481 --> 08:44.524
- Right.
- ...with this.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.943
- Yeah.
- And it goes on, it goes on

08:46.943 --> 08:48.653
and there's rustling
behind the curtain--

08:48.653 --> 08:49.904
- Struggling.
- Struggling.

08:49.904 --> 08:52.365
- Yelling for help.
- And yelling, "I can't breathe!"

08:52.365 --> 08:53.658
Yeah.
-"I can't breathe!

08:53.658 --> 08:55.660
I can't--" And it's like this
and struggling.

08:55.660 --> 08:59.372
And my father literally
screaming with laughter.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.583
And finally,
somebody opens the curtain.

09:01.583 --> 09:04.669
You fall out and you're saying,
"Untie me, untie me!"

09:04.669 --> 09:06.921

to this day</i>

09:06.921 --> 09:10.258
<i>but say without equivocation,
that in my life,</i>

09:10.258 --> 09:14.679
<i>there are but a handful of times
that I ever laughed as hard.</i>

09:14.679 --> 09:19.184
But at age 16,
you could make those people,

09:19.184 --> 09:21.936
those people we looked up to,
my dad, Mel,

09:21.936 --> 09:24.022
<i>those kinds of--
You could make them laugh.</i>

09:24.022 --> 09:27.525
And that to me was--
It was like a prodigy.

09:27.525 --> 09:31.363
As a kid with my nose pressed up
against the glass,

09:31.363 --> 09:34.991
okay, so, I watched television
a tad too close to the screen,

09:34.991 --> 09:38.411
I so badly wanted to know
what he was like as a friend,

09:38.411 --> 09:43.541
as a-- as a neighbor, as a pal,
as a guy to hang around with.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.669
<i>Now,
we shared a house together</i>

09:45.669 --> 09:48.129
<i>for a year or so
off Benedict Canyon.</i>

09:48.129 --> 09:50.382
You had an entrance down below,
I had an entrance above.

09:50.382 --> 09:55.011
We each had our own, uh, phones.
We had our own phones.

09:55.011 --> 09:57.972
Anytime I would bring
a girl over,

09:57.972 --> 10:01.893
uh, I would, you know,
enjoy myself with the girl.

10:01.893 --> 10:02.977
I mean, I...

10:02.977 --> 10:04.479
They would make love
and I would--

10:04.479 --> 10:05.772
- You can say it.
- And you would listen!

10:05.772 --> 10:07.023
I just said it.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.858
They would...
...make love...

10:08.858 --> 10:10.902
...and what's wrong with that?

10:10.902 --> 10:14.072
It's natural to...
...make love and--

10:14.072 --> 10:15.699
It wasn't that
we made love, Albert.

10:15.699 --> 10:16.991
It's that when we finished
making love,

10:16.991 --> 10:18.410
you used to call me
on the telephone

10:18.410 --> 10:21.413
and say, "Are you finished?"

10:21.413 --> 10:23.039
"Would you like
to get something to eat?"

10:23.039 --> 10:24.916
- And you wanna know the beauty?
- What?

10:24.916 --> 10:27.085
It was always 20 seconds.

10:30.422 --> 10:32.090
I would time it. He's starting.

10:32.090 --> 10:35.260
See how long I could
hold my breath. Let's eat.

10:37.512 --> 10:38.930
I was a huge comedy fan.

10:38.930 --> 10:42.100
I was used
to people standing up and...

10:42.100 --> 10:45.103
delivering their bit and...

10:45.103 --> 10:49.524
Alan King and all the guys
that would do straight stand-up.

10:49.524 --> 10:51.276
And then there's this guy.

10:52.277 --> 10:53.403
And he would come out

10:53.403 --> 10:55.488
and he would
do the wildest shit.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.865
Ladies and gentlemen,

10:56.865 --> 10:58.658
would you welcome, please,
a new face in an ancient art,

10:58.658 --> 11:03.038
the exciting, Albert Brooks.

11:03.038 --> 11:05.040
<i>You had a routine
that you did,</i>

11:05.040 --> 11:08.460
<i>which was brilliant,
which was a mime.</i>

11:08.460 --> 11:11.296
And you came out
in black leotard

11:11.296 --> 11:15.550
with the white face
and you never stopped talking.

11:15.550 --> 11:16.968
I call this piece

11:16.968 --> 11:19.971
"Walking The Dog,
Albert Brooks."

11:23.183 --> 11:25.185
Good morning, Poochie.
How are you this morning?

11:25.185 --> 11:27.562
You feeling good this morning?

11:27.562 --> 11:29.689
I hope you are, Poochie.
It is a lovely day.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.317
I know, isn't it?
Let's go upstairs, Poochie.

11:32.317 --> 11:34.694
See, there are no stairs.
I create that for you. You see?

11:34.694 --> 11:36.863
We'll go upstairs, Poochie.

11:36.863 --> 11:39.657
Ah, here we are at the--
Oh, good morning, Mrs. Brown.

11:39.657 --> 11:41.493
How are you?
Have you seen my dog, Poochie?

11:41.493 --> 11:43.036
He's lovely, isn't he? Yes.

11:43.036 --> 11:46.122
You'd like help with your rope?
I'll help you pull the rope.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.667
All right, Mrs. Brown.
All right now, Mrs.--

11:48.667 --> 11:50.669
No rope.
I'm just making this mime.

11:52.462 --> 11:53.546
And then I just went

11:53.546 --> 11:54.964
into a bad stand-up.
Yeah, yeah.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.299
I'm married now, of course.

11:56.299 --> 11:58.468
And my wife-- Take my wife,
please, you know?

11:59.594 --> 12:01.888
Oh, she's wonderful.
She's a wonderful lady.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.181
She's on a reducing diet.

12:03.181 --> 12:05.350
Any of you husbands know
what that's like, you know?

12:05.350 --> 12:06.226
She come home the other day,

12:06.226 --> 12:08.144
she says,
"Honey, I lost 35 pounds."

12:08.144 --> 12:10.522
I said, "Look behind you.
You'll find it."

12:10.522 --> 12:12.774
CONAN O'BRIEN: <i>Albert kind
of broke a sound barrier.</i>

12:12.774 --> 12:14.359
I was used
to watching television

12:14.359 --> 12:15.527
and seeing funny people.

12:15.527 --> 12:19.030
And then suddenly, there's,
you know, Chuck Yeager proves

12:19.030 --> 12:21.533
that there's this other place
you can go.

12:21.533 --> 12:22.617
There's a sonic boom

12:22.617 --> 12:24.703
and then you're going faster
than sound.

12:24.703 --> 12:25.954
Ladies and gentlemen,

12:25.954 --> 12:28.123
I'd like to reaffirm
that the art of ventriloquism

12:28.123 --> 12:29.207
is not dead.

12:29.207 --> 12:32.544
Would you welcome the very funny
Mr. Albert Brooks?

12:34.254 --> 12:37.257
I do remember
the ventriloquist bit.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.133
Yeah.

12:38.133 --> 12:40.051
It's kind of an iconic bit now, right?

12:40.051 --> 12:43.221
Well, good evening, everybody.
Yes, hello, everybody!

12:45.682 --> 12:49.227
I'm Dave. And I'm Danny.

12:49.227 --> 12:51.062
You know, Danny,
I'm a little nervous being here

12:51.062 --> 12:52.647
on television and everything.

12:52.647 --> 12:53.773
Well, why don't you have
a cigarette?

12:53.773 --> 12:55.775
That always calms you down.

12:55.775 --> 12:56.943
Well, I just can't have a smoke

12:56.943 --> 12:57.944
and leave everybody
sitting here.

12:57.944 --> 12:59.154
They might get bored.

12:59.154 --> 13:02.699
I'll sing a song
while you have a cigarette.

13:02.699 --> 13:05.076
Great idea.
What are you gonna sing?

13:05.076 --> 13:07.287
One of my favorites,
"Swanee River."

13:07.287 --> 13:08.455
Great.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.126
<i>He's so good,
you can't steal it.</i>

13:13.126 --> 13:14.919
Yeah, I mean like,
if you stole it,

13:14.919 --> 13:16.421
you wouldn't know
what to do with it.

13:16.421 --> 13:17.547
All right, Danny.

13:17.547 --> 13:20.050
Why don't you have a glass
of water?

13:20.050 --> 13:22.719
And so the audience
doesn't get bored, I'll sing.

13:24.596 --> 13:31.394
<i>♪ Lady of Spain, I adore you
Lady of Spain, I adore you ♪</i>

13:31.394 --> 13:33.855
<i>♪ Lady of Spain, I adore you ♪</i>

13:35.774 --> 13:37.233
I was doing, you know,

13:37.233 --> 13:40.362
I was doing conceptual pieces. Yes.

13:40.362 --> 13:42.906
<i>I had the world's
worst pickpocket.</i>

13:42.906 --> 13:44.115
Have I ever met you before ever?

13:44.115 --> 13:45.825
- No, you haven't.
- No? What's your name, please?

13:45.825 --> 13:47.660
- My name's Lou Rawls.
- I knew what it was, of course.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.037
- We have your albums over there.
- Wonderful.

13:49.037 --> 13:50.455
Wouldn't you know? It's amazing.

13:50.455 --> 13:52.123
Look at-- look at this dress.
Isn't he a wonderful dresser?

13:52.123 --> 13:53.958
What, did you-- Do you have this
tailor-made or something?

13:53.958 --> 13:55.251
- Yes, I do.
- Isn't that wonderful?

13:55.251 --> 13:57.170
You know, I always wanted
to have clothes like that.

13:57.170 --> 13:59.297
I never-- I never thought
I could get it, of course.

13:59.297 --> 14:00.131
Hey, what-- what?

14:00.131 --> 14:01.633
Wait a minute.
Just hold it a second.

14:01.633 --> 14:02.717
- Wait a minute.
- Wait a minute!

14:04.135 --> 14:05.637
<i>My first time
I ever saw Albert Brooks,</i>

14:05.637 --> 14:07.055
<i>he was an elephant trainer</i>

14:07.055 --> 14:08.932
and the elephant
was gonna do all the tricks,

14:08.932 --> 14:10.809
except the elephant got sick

14:10.809 --> 14:12.310
and couldn't come out.

14:12.310 --> 14:15.438
So Albert is going
to continue the show

14:15.438 --> 14:17.190
as the elephant trainer
with no elephant...

14:17.190 --> 14:18.316
Yeah.
- ...in the room.

14:18.316 --> 14:20.151
But he had a frog.
- But he had a frog.

14:20.151 --> 14:22.737
I will do my same act

14:22.737 --> 14:25.323
and you people
will please use your imagination

14:25.323 --> 14:28.827
and picture the frog
as my majestic elephant, Bimbo.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.538
I'll help you along
by making a noise

14:31.538 --> 14:34.290
my elephant makes such as...

14:34.290 --> 14:37.168
I thought it was wacky
and wonderful.

14:37.168 --> 14:39.587
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
my elephant, Bimbo...

14:39.587 --> 14:41.715
...all right, quiet...

14:41.715 --> 14:43.550
...will count for you,

14:43.550 --> 14:44.968
will tell you how old he is.

14:44.968 --> 14:46.052
I'll give you a hint.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.679
He's four years old,
so you know.

14:47.679 --> 14:50.598
All right, Bimbo.
How old are you, boy?

14:50.598 --> 14:51.975
Come on. One...

14:51.975 --> 14:56.146
...two, three, four.

14:58.023 --> 15:03.236
Stop, stop! Hold it, hold it!

15:03.236 --> 15:06.239
And it was unlike
any kind of comedy I had seen.

15:06.239 --> 15:10.035
I will put my face on this
and my elephant, Bimbo,

15:10.035 --> 15:13.872
will stand on my head
and I trust the elephant.

15:13.872 --> 15:19.377
All right, boy?
All right, boy? Okay, boy.

15:19.377 --> 15:23.840
All right, boy. Ready, boy? Go.

15:28.011 --> 15:30.889
I feel the elephant
gave me a wart in my ear.

15:30.889 --> 15:32.390
Have a peanut.

15:34.017 --> 15:36.728
<i>When was the first time
you ever saw Albert?</i>

15:36.728 --> 15:38.897
Probably, <i>The Tonight Show.</i>

15:38.897 --> 15:40.982
<i>The Tonight Show?</i>
- I think so. Yeah.

15:40.982 --> 15:42.984
If you've seen Albert work, uh...

15:43.902 --> 15:45.570
you still don't know
what he does.

15:46.571 --> 15:49.866
He's a very inventive young man.
Um, and he does--

15:49.866 --> 15:52.410
He takes premises
that he nurtures in his mind

15:52.410 --> 15:54.245
and then he takes them,
plays around with them

15:54.245 --> 15:56.122
and it's always fun to see
what he's gonna do.

15:57.624 --> 16:01.711
Before I did Carson,
I did A hundred variety shows.

16:01.711 --> 16:05.173
<i>Sullivan, Johnny Cash,
Helen Reddy, Glen Campbell,</i>

16:05.173 --> 16:08.385
<i>Hollywood Palace,
Everly Brothers, Flip Wilson,</i>

16:08.385 --> 16:10.428
<i>- Merv Griffin,</i> all of them.
- Yep. Right.

16:10.428 --> 16:14.432
So, I came to Carson late,
so I didn't have that fear.

16:14.432 --> 16:16.142
I-- I had already
been established.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.268
He was happy to see me.

16:17.268 --> 16:19.479
I was happy to see him. Wow.

16:19.479 --> 16:23.858
<i>Not until you do Carson
do you realize what that was.</i>

16:23.858 --> 16:26.277
- Everyone you knew saw it.
- Watched it, yeah.

16:26.277 --> 16:27.529
- So, your next day...
- Right.

16:27.529 --> 16:29.739
...you pick up your cleaning,
"Hey, great bit!"

16:29.739 --> 16:30.782
You go to the market.

16:30.782 --> 16:32.283
"Great bit!" It's like living

16:32.283 --> 16:33.702
in a-- in Carson world. Right.

16:33.702 --> 16:37.789
I was gonna take the time
that I usually do a spot

16:37.789 --> 16:38.873
and show a film.

16:38.873 --> 16:41.543
Not comedy
but a serious film that I made.

16:41.543 --> 16:42.794
<i>It was punk rock,</i>

16:42.794 --> 16:43.795
<i>almost, for comedy.</i>

16:43.795 --> 16:45.296
He saw what was going on.

16:45.296 --> 16:48.466
He saw the old Hollywood way.
And instead of just saying,

16:48.466 --> 16:51.136
"This is bad. This is corny,"
he showed them.

16:51.136 --> 16:54.723
And I spent my own money,
took a film crew,

16:54.723 --> 16:56.141
took me a whole year and made

16:56.141 --> 16:57.434
<i>The History
of the Animal Kingdom</i>

16:57.434 --> 17:00.520
<i>in Two and a Half Minutes.</i>
And, uh...

17:00.520 --> 17:03.481
the film is not here.
So, uh, I've got this.

17:03.481 --> 17:06.192
I got together a few props
that I could at the last minute.

17:06.901 --> 17:08.236
This is, uh,

17:08.236 --> 17:10.989
<i>History of the Animal Kingdom
in Two and a Half Minutes.</i>

17:10.989 --> 17:12.282
<i>It was exciting.</i>

17:12.282 --> 17:15.452
Didn't feel planned
and it was absurdist.

17:15.452 --> 17:18.663
You couldn't believe
the nerve of it.

17:18.663 --> 17:23.335
♪ (UP-TEMPO GUITAR PLAYING) ♪

17:33.094 --> 17:36.348
There was a certain
Wallenda aspect.

17:36.348 --> 17:38.350
I got no more pictures left!

17:40.352 --> 17:45.357
♪ (PEPPY MUSIC PLAYING) ♪

17:51.196 --> 17:52.614
♪ (MUSIC CONCLUDES) ♪

17:52.614 --> 17:56.117
Every comedian I know,
and to this day,

17:56.117 --> 17:58.203
they won't go
on national television

17:58.203 --> 18:01.289
unless they've worked it out
through in a club,

18:01.289 --> 18:02.540
they've tried it out many times.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.959
I know.
You're the only guy I know

18:04.959 --> 18:07.045
who would go
on national television

18:07.045 --> 18:10.215
with a routine
that you had never tried out

18:10.215 --> 18:12.425
and you would do it
for the first time

18:12.425 --> 18:15.178
- on national television.
- No, I went in the bathroom,

18:15.178 --> 18:18.640
I would look in the mirror,
I would come up with something

18:18.640 --> 18:20.058
and I would go do it.

18:20.058 --> 18:25.063
Your brain has to work
on such a level

18:25.063 --> 18:28.191
to do comedy
without trying it out.

18:28.191 --> 18:31.945
Carson was encouraging
to do something new every time

18:31.945 --> 18:33.613
because he used to say to me,

18:33.613 --> 18:36.741
"If you don't have to,
don't rehearse

18:36.741 --> 18:39.244
because I wanna be surprised."
Yeah.

18:39.244 --> 18:42.122
And he's the first dude
I ever seen,

18:42.122 --> 18:44.374
uh, at least,
make a marijuana joke

18:44.374 --> 18:47.043
and, like, light it up on TV.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.920
And he was sitting
next to Johnny Carson.

18:48.920 --> 18:50.422
You know, Johnny,
this is my tenth year

18:50.422 --> 18:52.924
on the show and I brought
something to celebrate.

19:06.187 --> 19:10.442
And he had
these elaborate impression,

19:10.442 --> 19:12.110
uh, kits.

19:12.110 --> 19:14.612
There are certain foods
that when they interact

19:14.612 --> 19:18.074
with the normal body chemistry,
produce the impressions.

19:18.074 --> 19:19.451
We're gonna show you.
It's uncanny.

19:19.451 --> 19:21.202
I don't do any of this stuff,
so, you know,

19:21.202 --> 19:22.787
maybe it won't work,
but it probably will.

19:22.787 --> 19:27.208
I mean, it's just really
over-the-top stuff that if he

19:27.208 --> 19:30.962
pitched it to you in hi--
you know, your kitchen,

19:30.962 --> 19:33.089
which I'm sure
he did many times,

19:33.089 --> 19:35.467
you probably would go...

19:35.467 --> 19:37.969
"That doesn't sound
like a real idea."

19:39.929 --> 19:41.973
A hot potato?
- A hot potato.

19:41.973 --> 19:43.141
Go on.
- All right.

19:43.141 --> 19:45.393
Curly, as you take
a little bit of pepper...

19:45.393 --> 19:47.687
a little bit-- You know, Curly,
the great Three Stooge?

19:47.687 --> 19:50.523
Hard to do. Not now.
Take a pepper.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.983
Put it-- put it like that.

19:51.983 --> 19:53.318
Okay, now...

19:53.318 --> 19:55.904
...you begin
to make a child's train noise.

19:55.904 --> 19:58.198
Whoo! Whoo!

19:58.198 --> 20:00.158
And with the potato. Whoo!

20:09.417 --> 20:12.379
And I just-- I can remember
just watching that going like...

20:13.129 --> 20:14.464
"Who is this man?"

20:14.464 --> 20:16.800
I wanna say something seriously.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.176
Yeah?

20:18.176 --> 20:21.429
I'm joking tonight
for a little boy

20:21.429 --> 20:23.264
who...

20:23.264 --> 20:26.685
...is very ill in a hospital
in Northern California.

20:26.685 --> 20:28.687
I promised him
I would get big laughs.

20:28.687 --> 20:32.190
If I do, he lives.
If I don't, he's gone.

20:33.358 --> 20:36.027
He did one routine with, um,

20:36.027 --> 20:39.114
that '80s toy,
the Speak Spell.

20:39.114 --> 20:41.366
I am premiering tonight
the second ingredient

20:41.366 --> 20:44.285

the electronic dummy.

20:44.285 --> 20:46.705

to throw your voice.

20:46.705 --> 20:48.581
Would you welcome Buddy?

20:50.834 --> 20:52.502

20:52.502 --> 20:56.089

20:56.089 --> 20:57.882

21:00.301 --> 21:02.554
<i>S.</i>
- Yes, I know you are.

21:02.554 --> 21:03.763
Buddy, do you know
where you are?

21:03.763 --> 21:05.265
Look around.

21:05.265 --> 21:08.560
<i>TV.</i>
- Very good, Buddy. Very good.

21:08.560 --> 21:11.563

you have the idea

21:11.563 --> 21:13.898
and then the courage
to execute it.

21:13.898 --> 21:17.193

Did you have a good time, Buddy?

21:17.193 --> 21:18.403
<i>C.</i>
- All right.

21:20.488 --> 21:22.240
Buddy has a party to go to
later tonight, Johnny,

21:22.240 --> 21:23.533
he's very excited.

21:23.533 --> 21:25.035
He and his girlfriend
have been going for two years.

21:25.035 --> 21:26.119
You're gonna exchange gifts, right?

21:26.119 --> 21:27.162
<i>S.</i>
- Uh-huh.

21:27.162 --> 21:28.413
You're gonna give her a car, right?

21:28.413 --> 21:29.748
<i>S.</i>
- What are you gonna
give her, Buddy?

21:29.748 --> 21:33.543
<i>X-K-E.</i>
- Ooh, a Jaguar. Very nice.

21:33.543 --> 21:34.961
What's she gonna give you,
Buddy?

21:34.961 --> 21:36.546
<i>VD.</i>
- All right.

21:38.673 --> 21:42.719
Albert was one of those people
that from day one,

21:42.719 --> 21:45.597
we tried to persuade
to come and do the show.

21:45.597 --> 21:48.183
<i>The thing that appealed

21:48.183 --> 21:49.934

21:49.934 --> 21:52.604
was the thing that appealed
to me about Albert,

21:52.604 --> 21:54.814
the way that he did talk shows
as a guest.

21:54.814 --> 21:59.194
<i>They were both these sort
of deconstructionist geniuses.</i>

21:59.194 --> 22:00.570

22:00.570 --> 22:02.614
Uh, this is not
what it looks like.

22:02.614 --> 22:03.448
Yeah?

22:03.448 --> 22:04.783
Let me explain to you something.

22:04.783 --> 22:06.743
I made this movie,
<i>Defending Your Life.</i>

22:06.743 --> 22:07.577
Right.

22:07.577 --> 22:09.579
And it is just so important
to me,

22:09.579 --> 22:10.955
that when my publicist said that

22:10.955 --> 22:14.209
you don't show clips anymore,
I just had to get a clip on.

22:14.209 --> 22:15.585
- Yeah. But you know...
- You'd understand that.

22:15.585 --> 22:17.003
...we show clips all the time.

22:17.003 --> 22:21.466
The first time I saw Albert
was on <i>David Letterman Show</i>

22:21.466 --> 22:23.510
and he had called in
to <i>Letterman,</i>

22:23.510 --> 22:27.597
or somebody called him?
You called him!

22:27.597 --> 22:29.683
It was you!

22:29.683 --> 22:31.685
Is he a nice man
to talk to on the phone?

22:31.685 --> 22:33.478
Yes. Absolutely.

22:33.478 --> 22:35.855
Nice man to talk to on the phone
or off the phone.

22:41.444 --> 22:42.529
<i>Hello?</i>
- Albert?

22:42.529 --> 22:43.905
Listen, I'm here with David
and he...

22:43.905 --> 22:45.949
- Tell him I said hello.
- He's-- David says hello.

22:47.867 --> 22:49.953
Yes. I'm on the air
with David Letterman.

22:49.953 --> 22:51.162
- Yeah.
- Yes?

22:51.162 --> 22:52.831
- Yes?
- Yeah, he can hear you.

Yeah. Sure, Albert.
Whatever you want.

He's doing his stupid pet trick
over the phone?

23:23.653 --> 23:25.697
Maybe we got him
at a bad time.

23:26.489 --> 23:27.949
Yeah. What's he doing, Albert?

27:00.912 --> 27:03.707

28:30.919 --> 28:32.962
No.
- One of the funny moments

28:32.962 --> 28:35.131
of that is that
they were panicking,

28:35.131 --> 28:37.217
trying to see
what they could even do,

28:37.217 --> 28:40.637

but before it ended,

at the time,

"Get up there!
Sing something! Get up there!"

28:48.770 --> 28:51.189
And he went up
and he sang his hit,

28:51.189 --> 28:55.527
which was called,
"There Will Be No Tomorrow."

"Maybe that's not good advice."

29:09.874 --> 29:12.752
So, everybody laughed.

29:40.238 --> 29:43.742
- And I said, "Daddy's dead."
- Oh, wow. Wow.

29:43.742 --> 29:46.327

29:51.291 --> 29:53.084

What?

30:06.931 --> 30:09.100

30:09.100 --> 30:11.269
One of the original

30:11.269 --> 30:12.395
- Wow.
- Shemp.

30:12.395 --> 30:14.939
No. Wait a minute. No, no.
Curly was the original.

30:14.939 --> 30:16.066
No. Shemp.

30:16.066 --> 30:17.942
No, I thought
Shemp replaced Curly.

30:17.942 --> 30:19.778
No. Curly replaced Shemp.

30:19.778 --> 30:21.029
Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

30:21.029 --> 30:22.614
I always thought
it was the other way around.

30:22.614 --> 30:24.449
No. No. Woo, woo, woo, woo.

30:24.449 --> 30:25.992
Well, "woo, woo, woo" was Curly.

30:25.992 --> 30:27.285
- That I know.
- It doesn't matter!

30:27.285 --> 30:28.787
- He'd still like it.
- He didn't do "woo, woo, woo."

30:28.787 --> 30:29.829
Shemp never did.

30:29.829 --> 30:31.164
- He'd still like it.
- All right.

30:31.164 --> 30:33.792
Wow. And look at that.
Right there.

30:33.792 --> 30:35.085

- Yeah.

<i>I feel I wanna be cremated.</i>

30:48.932 --> 30:50.975

and she said,

30:50.975 --> 30:53.144
"Honey, you know,
I wanna be cremated."

30:53.144 --> 30:55.814
I said, "Of course,
I could tell by your cooking."

30:58.983 --> 31:02.112
<i>So, you didn't get to live
a long time with your father</i>

31:02.112 --> 31:03.988
<i>but your mom lived to 94.</i>

31:03.988 --> 31:06.950
And what kind of relationship
did you have with her?

31:06.950 --> 31:09.828
Well, see my movie, <i>Mother.</i>

31:09.828 --> 31:11.329
Mother...
Yeah?

31:11.329 --> 31:15.917
- ...the ice cream is colorless.
- Look under the protective ice.

31:16.543 --> 31:18.336
The protective ice?

31:18.336 --> 31:21.339
You've actually named
the clear hard crap

31:21.339 --> 31:22.632
that sits on the top?

31:22.632 --> 31:26.720
I very much relate to Albert
seeking approval from his mom.

31:26.720 --> 31:28.263
But you didn't like
the book, right?

31:28.263 --> 31:29.931
You don't think
it deserves a sequel?

31:29.931 --> 31:32.183
Well, no, honey.
I love the book.

31:32.183 --> 31:35.478
But are you sure you wanna
bring back all those characters?

31:40.150 --> 31:42.360
That is so what a mom
would say of just,

31:42.360 --> 31:44.863
"Really? You're gonna do that?
You're gonna wear that?

31:44.863 --> 31:47.699
- Really? Okay."
- I'll talk to you later.

31:47.699 --> 31:52.120
<i>Honey, I love you.</i>
- I know you think you do.

31:54.205 --> 31:56.416
That's not
the kindest thing to say

31:56.416 --> 31:59.127
but it does acknowledge
that I know you think you do.

31:59.127 --> 32:00.295
Yeah, yeah.
- And that's something

32:00.295 --> 32:01.796
and I'll give it credit. Yeah.

32:01.796 --> 32:04.299
'Cause if I tell my mom
she doesn't love me--

32:04.299 --> 32:06.217
Of course she does.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

32:06.217 --> 32:09.012
Of course she says she does.
Seems insane to her.

32:09.012 --> 32:10.388
But now I know
what to say to her.

32:10.388 --> 32:13.224
"I know you think you do.
And I love you too, Mom."

32:13.224 --> 32:15.101
How many times
were you on Carson or--

32:15.101 --> 32:16.561
- How many times?
- Thirty.

32:16.561 --> 32:17.520
Thirty times? Yeah.

32:17.520 --> 32:19.272
You were always trying
to get your mother

32:19.272 --> 32:22.984

that you were killing

32:22.984 --> 32:26.571

- The standard conversation,

32:26.571 --> 32:27.655
I would call her.

32:27.655 --> 32:29.407
She wouldn't call me
after a show.

32:29.407 --> 32:31.159
If I waited
for that phone to ring,

32:31.159 --> 32:34.412
it would be a month later.
So I would call her.

32:34.913 --> 32:36.164
"Hi."

32:36.164 --> 32:38.458
"Oh, honey, you're done?"
That was the first thing.

32:38.458 --> 32:40.752
"No, we're on the show.
Here's Johnny.

32:40.752 --> 32:43.630
Yes, I'm done."

32:43.630 --> 32:45.965
"So, uh, what did you think?"

32:45.965 --> 32:52.263
And you know, she went,
"Oh, honey, it was--

32:52.263 --> 32:54.933

Wow.

34:48.380 --> 34:52.092
No. I never published.
Your father talked me out of it.

34:52.092 --> 34:54.052
Why would he do that?

34:54.052 --> 34:55.470
You know, dear, in those days,

34:55.470 --> 34:59.557
a woman didn't have a career.
You know, she just...

34:59.557 --> 35:03.687
Raised children who she hated
for ruining her life

35:03.687 --> 35:07.565
and killing her chances of doing
the one thing she loved.

35:08.900 --> 35:11.069
Our dads were both comedians

35:11.069 --> 35:12.862
and our mothers
were both singers.

35:12.862 --> 35:14.072
My mother was a singer too.

35:14.072 --> 35:17.033
<i>And also parked her career</i>

35:17.033 --> 35:19.202
to raise children
and always wanted

35:19.202 --> 35:20.578
to get on stage.

35:20.578 --> 35:25.125
Now, I would notice at parties,
the happiest she was

35:25.125 --> 35:27.085
is when somebody
would play the piano

35:27.085 --> 35:28.920
- and she would sing.
- Right.

35:28.920 --> 35:34.092
And you naively think
that your parents

35:34.092 --> 35:37.470
or your siblings
automatically support you

35:37.470 --> 35:38.930
a hundred percent. Right.

35:38.930 --> 35:44.686
But human beings have qualities
like jealousy and being envious.

35:44.686 --> 35:47.105
And it doesn't matter
if it's a father or a son.

35:47.105 --> 35:48.398
Right, right, right.
- It's like, "Jesus,

35:48.398 --> 35:50.692
I never got to play
baseball like that."

35:50.692 --> 35:52.944
-"Good! Good hit!" You know?
- Yeah, yeah.

35:52.944 --> 35:54.279
I mean, it's just the brain.

35:54.279 --> 35:56.364

that you're starting

35:56.364 --> 35:58.408
in show business,
you're starting to succeed,

35:58.408 --> 36:01.286

I know my mother loved me
and I know she was happy for me,

36:04.789 --> 36:07.834

36:07.834 --> 36:12.130
I didn't talk very much
when something great happened

36:12.130 --> 36:13.214
because there was just--

36:13.214 --> 36:14.549
'Cause you didn't want her
to feel--

36:14.549 --> 36:16.259
Yes. I could feel a limit.
Yeah. Yeah.

on morphine but, you know--

37:00.261 --> 37:02.847

I said, "Mom, Mom. Hi."

37:08.687 --> 37:09.646

37:13.316 --> 37:16.403
"You've lost a little weight."

37:16.403 --> 37:17.696

It didn't happen on the stage.

39:39.796 --> 39:42.674
I went back to my hotel
in between shows,

39:42.674 --> 39:44.843
and I don't know,
it just sort of--

39:44.843 --> 39:46.636
The world changed. Yeah.

39:46.636 --> 39:49.014
It just sort of--
I had an explosion.

39:49.014 --> 39:50.682
He called me. He said,

39:50.682 --> 39:53.268
"The elephants are moving
on the wall

39:53.268 --> 39:56.688
of the wallpaper in my motel."

39:56.688 --> 39:59.149
I said, "So, you should
probably come home now.

39:59.149 --> 40:00.775
That's a bad sign."

40:00.775 --> 40:04.029
What I think it was,
and I could say this now.

40:04.029 --> 40:06.364
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I couldn't tell you then.

40:06.364 --> 40:10.618
<i>I think I got so good
at not getting close.</i>

40:10.618 --> 40:13.371
<i>As a very little kid,
two, three, and four,</i>

40:13.371 --> 40:15.373
<i>I was gonna outsmart God.</i>

40:15.373 --> 40:17.500
<i>I'm not gonna get close
to the sky</i>

40:17.500 --> 40:19.377
<i>and then you're just
gonna take him.</i>

40:19.377 --> 40:21.671
Uh, I'm smarter than that.

40:21.671 --> 40:25.592
And I learned how
to keep distance.

40:25.592 --> 40:28.345
Hmm.
And that not getting close,

40:28.345 --> 40:30.722
that being detached
from everything,

40:30.722 --> 40:33.933
I almost feel like
that was waiting.

40:34.392 --> 40:36.895
"Hello. Excuse me.

40:36.895 --> 40:40.440
Here's 15 years
you never dealt with."

40:40.440 --> 40:42.859
- Wow.
- And it was all of that at once.

40:42.859 --> 40:46.571
Could it have been
the fact that that coincided

40:46.571 --> 40:48.907
with the fact that your father
died on stage?

40:48.907 --> 40:49.991
Yes. Yes.

40:49.991 --> 40:52.410
It still plays in my head.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

40:53.495 --> 40:55.080
NBC's Saturday Night.

40:55.080 --> 40:57.582
<i>You were approached
by Lorne Michaels</i>

40:57.582 --> 40:59.959
to host <i>Saturday Night Live.</i>
Okay, yeah. Yes.

40:59.959 --> 41:00.919
I'll tell you the story.

41:00.919 --> 41:03.797
And this is a true story
and I never tell it

41:03.797 --> 41:05.465
because nobody wants
to hear it, but--

41:05.465 --> 41:07.258
- I wanna hear it.
- No, I'm just saying.

41:07.258 --> 41:10.720
<i>They called me in 1974.</i>

41:10.720 --> 41:13.098
<i>I went to an office
with Dick Ebersol</i>

41:13.098 --> 41:14.265
<i>and Lorne Michaels.</i>

41:14.265 --> 41:15.433
Right.
And they said,

41:15.433 --> 41:17.435
"We're gonna do
an original show."

41:17.435 --> 41:18.645
Fantastic.

41:18.645 --> 41:20.939
"We'd like it to be
<i>The Albert Brooks Show."</i>

41:20.939 --> 41:22.148
Wow.

41:22.148 --> 41:24.567
And I said, "You know what?
Every show has a regular host.

41:24.567 --> 41:28.321
You should do revolving hosts.
That's what I would do."

41:28.321 --> 41:29.280
Right.

41:29.280 --> 41:32.283
Then four months later,
they didn't have anybody

41:32.283 --> 41:34.119
and they wanted my name.

41:34.119 --> 41:37.789
At that time, they liked
what my name represented,

41:37.789 --> 41:41.084
and they wanted my name,
and they said,

41:41.084 --> 41:42.961
"What do you want to do?"

41:42.961 --> 41:47.173
And I had made a short film
years earlier for PBS,

41:47.173 --> 41:48.925
The Great American
Dream Machine,

41:48.925 --> 41:51.636
<i>where I took an article
I wrote in</i> Esquire,

41:51.636 --> 41:55.181
<i>"The Albert Brooks'
Famous School for Comedians,"</i>

41:55.181 --> 41:56.641
<i>to teach you to be a comedian.</i>

41:56.641 --> 41:57.851
<i>Right.
Like a commercial.</i>

41:57.851 --> 41:59.602
"Hello!
Do you think you can be funny?"

41:59.602 --> 42:02.856
How many times have you gotten
nice laughs at a party?

42:02.856 --> 42:04.983
Had a friend turn to you
and say,

42:04.983 --> 42:07.569
"You know something?
That was pretty funny.

42:07.569 --> 42:10.405
You should think
about being a comedian."

42:10.405 --> 42:12.490
Well, your friend was right.

42:12.490 --> 42:15.702
First today,
we'll visit comedy take class.

42:15.702 --> 42:18.538
Here, the students practice
all kinds of takes.

42:18.538 --> 42:20.832
The double take, the elbow take.

42:20.832 --> 42:23.251
And today, they're working
on the spit take,

42:23.251 --> 42:26.838
made so famous by Danny Thomas
on <i>Make Room for Daddy.</i>

42:26.838 --> 42:29.174
Remember when Danny
would be drinking coffee,

42:29.174 --> 42:32.886
his agent, Sid, would come in
with some surprising news?

42:32.886 --> 42:36.056
Danny would spit the coffee
all over Sid and the furniture.

42:36.056 --> 42:38.183
Let's see
how these kids are doing.

42:39.476 --> 42:40.977
All right.
Now that was pretty good

42:40.977 --> 42:42.979
but I'd like to try it
just one more time

42:42.979 --> 42:43.897
in the same way.

42:43.897 --> 42:46.608
Now remember,
I just walked into the room.

42:46.608 --> 42:48.109
Now, start to drink.

42:49.319 --> 42:51.654
Good. Now, I speak.

42:51.654 --> 42:53.656
Guess what?
I just heard from the bank,

42:53.656 --> 42:55.450
and not only don't you have
any money,

42:55.450 --> 42:59.412
but your sister is dead!

42:59.412 --> 43:00.538
That's good.

43:00.538 --> 43:02.165
That's much better,
except, again,

43:02.165 --> 43:04.167
Carol, you didn't put
the liquid in your mouth

43:04.167 --> 43:07.545
and you gargled instead of spit
for the fifth straight time.

43:07.545 --> 43:08.797
That was funny.

43:08.797 --> 43:11.675
So, I said,
"Let me make short films."

43:11.675 --> 43:15.053
<i>So, they made an agreement.
I would make six short films</i>

43:15.053 --> 43:17.180
<i>and I would do it
from Los Angeles.</i>

43:17.180 --> 43:20.433
He shaped the trajectory
of <i>Saturday Night Live</i>

43:20.433 --> 43:22.185
in two ways.

43:22.185 --> 43:24.562
It's because of him
that they have guest hosts

43:24.562 --> 43:27.524
every week,
and it's because of him

43:27.524 --> 43:29.901
that they have film pieces.

43:29.901 --> 43:31.861
<i>In an unprecedented move</i>

- Like, they were like,

44:14.946 --> 44:18.825
the most punk comedy thing
I had ever seen at that point.

44:18.825 --> 44:20.785
This is my favorite part

44:20.785 --> 44:22.495
of the show
because it gives me a chance

44:22.495 --> 44:24.289
to introduce a film written, directed,

44:24.289 --> 44:26.750
and starring my best friend,
Albert Brooks.

44:26.750 --> 44:28.460
The show that you were on.

44:28.460 --> 44:29.961
Yeah,
that was the third show.

44:29.961 --> 44:33.882
He-- I made a film
that ran too long for his taste.

44:33.882 --> 44:35.508
- Yeah.
- And Lorne said,

44:35.508 --> 44:37.218
"Um, we're not running it.
It's too long."

44:37.218 --> 44:41.514
Yeah.
- And thank God you hosted...

44:41.514 --> 44:43.183
Yeah.
- ...and you said,

44:43.183 --> 44:44.768
"I wanna run that."

44:44.768 --> 44:46.644
So many of us go through life

44:46.644 --> 44:49.647
doing one thing,
wanting to do something else.

44:49.647 --> 44:51.691
I'm one of those people.
I'm a comedian.

44:51.691 --> 44:52.942
Show business
has been good to me.

44:52.942 --> 44:55.612
But quite frankly,
if I had the grades in school,

44:55.612 --> 44:57.405
I would have become a surgeon.

44:57.405 --> 45:01.493
Well, on July 22nd of this year,
I did something about it.

45:01.493 --> 45:02.952
I took out the following ad

45:02.952 --> 45:05.330
in ten of the nation's
leading newspapers.

45:05.330 --> 45:07.791
"I, Albert Brooks,

45:16.132 --> 45:18.134

45:18.134 --> 45:21.179

I pray it doesn't hurt.

45:21.179 --> 45:23.014

- I pray it doesn't hurt.

Where is the anesthesiologist?

45:25.767 --> 45:29.020
I don't know.
You're the chief.

45:29.020 --> 45:32.065
Look,
I have been up for a week,

45:32.065 --> 45:34.401
I have a very bad sore throat.

45:34.401 --> 45:36.653
- Don't start with me.
- He don't feel very well.

45:39.656 --> 45:40.949

45:40.949 --> 45:42.784
So, it always felt to me, like,

45:42.784 --> 45:45.537
there was this weird
J.D. Salinger comedy guy

45:45.537 --> 45:47.789
that every once in a while
would offer something up,

45:47.789 --> 45:49.582

45:50.917 --> 45:52.711
Hi, Albert.
- You got it?

45:52.711 --> 45:55.880
Yes.
It's new.

45:55.880 --> 45:58.800
I know that you use to hang out
with Steven Spielberg.

45:58.800 --> 46:00.969
- Yeah.
- And he would film you.

46:00.969 --> 46:03.304
I think he just liked
to always run the camera.

46:03.304 --> 46:05.724
Yeah, but he didn't run it
with everybody. He just ran--

46:05.724 --> 46:07.350
No,
because I was giving him stuff.

46:07.350 --> 46:08.435
Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

46:08.435 --> 46:11.104
I started filming Albert
in 1973.

46:11.104 --> 46:14.566
<i>We'd go down, like, Sunset
or go up La Cienega</i>

46:14.566 --> 46:17.027

<i>Real Life,</i>

46:56.316 --> 46:58.985
Which is the first one?
- ...five years in mockumentary.

46:58.985 --> 47:01.988

a motion picture so exciting

will be presented in 3D,

47:05.325 --> 47:08.828
so you can literally
"feel" the excitement.

47:08.828 --> 47:10.872
<i>Real Life</i> tells the story
of what happens

47:10.872 --> 47:12.290
when a real family's life

47:12.290 --> 47:14.959
is turned
into a major motion picture.

47:14.959 --> 47:19.631
That family could have been you,
or you, or you!

47:19.631 --> 47:21.007
If you remember some years ago,

47:21.007 --> 47:22.634
I think it was on PBS,
they did it.

47:22.634 --> 47:23.885
Was it on national television?

47:23.885 --> 47:25.970
They covered a family
called the Loud family.

47:25.970 --> 47:29.766
<i>The idea was exciting
to do because, you know,</i>

47:29.766 --> 47:32.852
other than the Loud family,
no one had sort of

47:32.852 --> 47:35.146
made fun of this yet. Yeah.

47:35.146 --> 47:37.107
<i>It was so ahead of the curve.</i>

47:37.107 --> 47:40.985
Everything he was talking about
is what television turned into.

47:40.985 --> 47:44.447
<i>I saw</i> Real Life <i>and I thought,</i>

47:44.447 --> 47:47.992

Yeah, yeah, yeah.

47:58.586 --> 48:01.297
...Albert satirized that,
but he was very aware

48:01.297 --> 48:03.717
that people will be obsessed
with making it

48:03.717 --> 48:04.843
entertaining enough...

48:04.843 --> 48:06.219
Right.
- ...and that show business

48:06.219 --> 48:08.138
would ruin it
and make it impure.

48:08.138 --> 48:10.682
Honey, do you think it's safe
for you to be eating

48:10.682 --> 48:12.517
with your heating pad
in your lap?

48:14.352 --> 48:18.023
I have terrible cramps,
I am bleeding profusely,

48:18.023 --> 48:21.943
and I wanna vomit on the table.

48:21.943 --> 48:23.278
What are you doing?

48:23.278 --> 48:26.197
No, I just wanna let them know
that this is not the way

48:26.197 --> 48:28.992
we usually talk,
especially at the dinner table.

48:28.992 --> 48:33.830
This actually, uh, had
some reflection of society

48:33.830 --> 48:36.958
that are still relevant today.

48:36.958 --> 48:40.045
I made an appointment
with my gynecologist

48:40.045 --> 48:42.714
for a quarter to 10:00
tomorrow morning.

48:42.714 --> 48:45.467
And if you want to,
you and the crew

48:45.467 --> 48:47.302
can feel free to join me.

48:48.053 --> 48:50.305
Film the gynecologist?

48:50.305 --> 48:54.184
It became, for me,
the test movie for--

48:54.184 --> 48:56.269
If I was dating a girl,
it'd be like,

48:56.269 --> 48:58.313
"Let's watch <i>Real Life."</i>

48:58.313 --> 49:00.523
- What are these?
- These are cameras.

49:00.523 --> 49:03.151
Oh, no. Oh, God damn it.

49:03.151 --> 49:04.986
What's going on here?
I was clear.

49:04.986 --> 49:06.279
Now, come on.
Get out of here, you!

49:06.279 --> 49:07.739
Wait, wait, wait!
I don't need you here.

49:07.739 --> 49:09.908
This is a big motion picture.
I'm Albert Brooks. How are you?

49:09.908 --> 49:11.326
I don't care
who the hell you are.

49:11.326 --> 49:13.078
Talk to my lawyer.
I was cleared.

49:13.078 --> 49:14.245
Get out. Out, out!

49:14.245 --> 49:15.580
Dr. Rennert,
these people are with me.

49:15.580 --> 49:17.374
They're filming my life.
Mrs. Yeager, I'm sorry

49:17.374 --> 49:18.917
but I've had
some bad experiences

49:18.917 --> 49:20.919
with the <i>60 Minutes</i> people.
No, no.

49:20.919 --> 49:22.337
Huh...

49:22.337 --> 49:26.716
There's four of us here, okay?
He wants an abortion, all right?

49:26.716 --> 49:28.301
Two. Make it two.

49:28.301 --> 49:31.262
I'll take a hysterectomy.
She'll have the same.

49:31.262 --> 49:34.432
How about this for parking?
You think 500 might do it?

49:34.432 --> 49:37.936
I just wanna film her life.
Please, don't make trouble.

49:37.936 --> 49:40.980
Oh, my God. Maxwell Rennert,
the baby broker.

49:40.980 --> 49:43.274
- Oh, God damn it! Come on.
- Oh, I can't believe it.

49:43.274 --> 49:45.944
Was it tough to get that made?

49:45.944 --> 49:48.947
I have found nothing easy
to get made.

49:48.947 --> 49:51.533
Getting made
was the hard part of the life.

49:51.533 --> 49:53.535
<i>I was dating Linda Ronstadt.</i>

49:53.535 --> 49:56.079
<i>One of her managers,
he had a cousin,</i>

49:56.079 --> 49:58.915
who at the time
owned the Chicago Bulls.

49:58.915 --> 50:01.710
- Okay.
- I sat in a steam room with him,

50:01.710 --> 50:03.586
and pitched this thing.

50:03.586 --> 50:04.921
And he said to me,

50:04.921 --> 50:06.631
"I'll give you
half a million dollars.

50:06.631 --> 50:10.218
You have to take a letter
of credit out at a bank

50:10.218 --> 50:13.138
and anything over is yours."

50:13.138 --> 50:14.472
That you have to pay for?

50:14.472 --> 50:15.849
I have to pay for.
- Right.

50:15.849 --> 50:17.934
And it made every moment tense.

50:19.227 --> 50:21.312
But I wanna take
this opportunity, Rob.

50:21.312 --> 50:24.357
The man in Chicago,
he keeps calling me and saying,

50:24.357 --> 50:26.526
"Well, I-- I don't care
if the picture makes money,

50:26.526 --> 50:28.153
I just don't want you
to go over budget.

50:28.153 --> 50:29.988
I don't want a call
in the middle of the night

50:29.988 --> 50:31.364
saying, 'I need more money.
I need more money.

50:31.364 --> 50:32.615
I need more money.'"
They're worried?

50:32.615 --> 50:34.159
- They're worried about it?
- Yeah. They're worried.

50:34.159 --> 50:35.702
Taking a chance
with a first-time director?

50:35.702 --> 50:37.162
Yeah, but I mean,
I'm a nice guy.

50:37.162 --> 50:38.329
I'm not gonna spend his money.

50:38.329 --> 50:40.290
So, I thought
maybe I could swear to God

50:40.290 --> 50:41.583
to him on television.
Go ahead.

50:41.583 --> 50:43.335
Would that be all right?
Go ahead. Go ahead.

50:43.335 --> 50:45.670
Can I get a-- Okay.
Yeah, give him a close-up.

50:45.670 --> 50:47.380
Mr. Culver is the name.

50:47.380 --> 50:50.759
I, Albert Brooks, swear to God
I won't go over budget.

50:52.052 --> 50:55.180
If I do, I will pay every penny
out of my own pocket,

50:55.180 --> 50:58.058
or Rob and Penny
will pay for it.

50:58.058 --> 51:00.226
Real Life <i>was made independently,</i>

51:00.226 --> 51:02.729
<i>and Paramount Pictures
bought it.</i>

51:02.729 --> 51:04.314
This was my introduction.

51:04.314 --> 51:06.274
It was like a Broadway show.
Right, right.

51:06.274 --> 51:09.694
And I get a call that said,
"We're rethinking this.

51:09.694 --> 51:15.033
We're not gonna go to New York.
Let's not do the critics now.

51:15.033 --> 51:21.373
Let's open in Honolulu,
in Dallas, and New Orleans."

51:21.373 --> 51:25.251
I said, "I'm gonna do better
with critics than I'm gonna do

51:25.251 --> 51:27.545
with people in Honolulu."
Right, right.

51:27.545 --> 51:30.298
If you pull it out
of the critics' screenings,

51:30.298 --> 51:31.549
it says to the critics,

51:31.549 --> 51:33.677
the film is flawed.
Right, right.

51:33.677 --> 51:35.053
And I said,

51:35.053 --> 51:39.057
"If you do this,
I won't do one show,

51:39.057 --> 51:41.893
and if I talk to any press,
I will tell them

51:41.893 --> 51:43.395
that you've ruined my life."

51:43.395 --> 51:47.190
And they said, "Well, let us
call you back in 15 minutes."

51:47.190 --> 51:49.943
Thank God that for whatever
threat, it worked.

51:49.943 --> 51:53.738
<i>And you know, I got the reviews
that started my career.</i>

51:53.738 --> 51:55.907
<i>Yes.
If that didn't happen,</i>

51:55.907 --> 51:57.617
I don't know where I'd be.

51:57.617 --> 52:00.495
So, you mentioned Harry Shearer,
that you worked

52:00.495 --> 52:03.248
- on <i>A Star Is Bought.</i>
- And <i>Real Life,</i>

52:03.248 --> 52:04.416
- Harry, worked. Yeah.
- And <i>Real Life.</i>

52:04.416 --> 52:05.625
He was one of the writers. Yeah.

52:05.625 --> 52:07.961
Along with Monica Johnson. Yes.

52:07.961 --> 52:09.504
<i>You worked with Monica...</i>

52:09.504 --> 52:10.630
- On many pictures.
- ...on other pictures.

52:10.630 --> 52:12.590
Tell me about your relationship
with Monica.

52:12.590 --> 52:13.591
Well, Monica was great.

52:13.591 --> 52:17.345
Monica understood
the Albert Brooks character

52:17.345 --> 52:20.640
like nobody else.
She was so funny.

52:20.640 --> 52:24.102
<i>I wanted to be in a room
or in a car with her</i>

52:24.102 --> 52:25.478
because back and forth,

52:25.478 --> 52:27.689
I think it made me better. Right.

52:27.689 --> 52:30.066
She got everything.
And then she could

52:30.066 --> 52:31.901
throw out a line...
Yeah, yeah.

52:31.901 --> 52:34.029
...and you know,
just something really--

52:34.029 --> 52:35.447
She-- she got it.

52:35.447 --> 52:38.366
I became aware of Albert
on <i>The Tonight Show.</i>

52:38.366 --> 52:42.245
I became obsessed with Albert
with <i>Modern Romance.</i>

52:42.245 --> 52:48.501
<i>- Modern Romance.
- Modern Romance.</i>

52:48.501 --> 52:50.170
It's my life.

52:50.170 --> 52:52.088
God, there's something
wrong with you.

52:52.088 --> 52:53.882
No, there isn't. I'm in love.

52:53.882 --> 52:55.258
- That's not it.
- Yes.

52:55.258 --> 52:57.927
- No.
- Yes, I'm in love. I love you.

53:00.638 --> 53:03.391
I called the number, okay?
A guy answered.

53:03.391 --> 53:06.019
Obviously, a guy
isn't your brother's girlfriend.

53:06.019 --> 53:08.271
So, who is he?
You slept with him? Twice?

53:08.271 --> 53:11.232
- I'm going home.
- I've been this guy.

53:11.232 --> 53:13.568
I've been this guy
a lot of times.

53:13.568 --> 53:18.031
I'm, you know, much older now.
I can still be that guy.

53:18.031 --> 53:23.995
<i>Modern Romance</i> was, you know,
me willing to look completely

53:23.995 --> 53:27.832
like a psychopath
and how jealousy works.

53:27.832 --> 53:30.418
I don't think
that we should go out anymore.

53:30.418 --> 53:32.671
I mean, I just think it's over.

53:32.671 --> 53:34.381
You've heard
of a no-win situation,

53:34.381 --> 53:36.800
- haven't you?
- No.

53:36.800 --> 53:40.428
No? Really no?
You've never heard of one?

53:40.428 --> 53:44.057
Vietnam, this?
I'm telling you, they're around.

53:44.057 --> 53:45.392
I think we're in one of them.

53:45.392 --> 53:47.727
So, the jealousy,
all of that feeling of jealousy,

53:47.727 --> 53:49.270
that was just something...
That's--

53:49.270 --> 53:50.438
...you felt, but you didn't--

53:50.438 --> 53:53.108
I felt and it was weird,
and I wanted to show it.

53:53.108 --> 53:54.401
Yeah.

53:54.401 --> 53:55.985
Look, you two didn't get along.
You said it yourself,

53:55.985 --> 53:57.195
all you ever did was fight.

53:57.195 --> 53:59.030
You're right. Thank you.
Thank you.

53:59.030 --> 54:00.115
That's all we ever did.

54:00.115 --> 54:01.533
I'm telling you,
we fought and fought

54:01.533 --> 54:04.244
and then we had great sex.

54:04.244 --> 54:05.954
We never really could talk.

54:06.996 --> 54:08.164
Do you need to talk?

54:08.164 --> 54:11.042
The whole thing
made me so uncomfortable

54:11.042 --> 54:13.294
because I was at the time,

54:13.294 --> 54:15.547
in a very unpleasant relationship.

54:15.547 --> 54:17.382
And I thought,
"Well, this is admirable."

54:17.382 --> 54:22.137
If you can go and do a movie
and it makes you feel...

54:22.137 --> 54:24.389
it magnifies
what you're feeling already.

54:24.389 --> 54:25.974
The head of Columbia said,

54:25.974 --> 54:28.435
"You have to add
a psychiatrist scene

54:28.435 --> 54:30.103
and explain this behavior."

54:30.103 --> 54:31.813
- Right. Right.
-"And if you don't add

54:31.813 --> 54:35.358
a psychiatrist scene,
you won't have a second week,"

54:35.358 --> 54:38.194
which basically meant,
we're not gonna advertise.

54:38.194 --> 54:40.530
Wow. Wow.
- And Stanley Kubrick called me.

54:40.530 --> 54:43.158
<i>And he said,
"You're blaming yourself.</i>

54:43.158 --> 54:44.576
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

54:44.576 --> 54:46.828
Studios make a decision
of whether a movie

54:46.828 --> 54:49.622
is gonna be a hit.
It's their decision.

54:49.622 --> 54:53.710
I've watched your movie play
in front of 25 people.

54:53.710 --> 54:54.753
<i>It's killer."</i>

54:54.753 --> 54:57.630
<i>And then he said,
"How did you do this?"</i>

54:57.630 --> 55:00.508
"This is the jealousy movie
I've always wanted to make."

55:00.508 --> 55:03.553
And I'm going,
"Hello. How did I do it?

55:03.553 --> 55:06.890
How did the guy
walk upside down in 2001?"

55:08.099 --> 55:12.062
"You tell me and I'll tell you
how I screwed up the girl."

55:13.438 --> 55:15.648
The roller coaster ride
of <i>Modern Romance,</i>

55:15.648 --> 55:18.193
that really always connected
with me. It just--

So, what this movie
is really about is fear,

58:12.617 --> 58:15.787
which, you know,
I've dealt with my whole life.

58:15.787 --> 58:19.874
<i>And so, if you could live
a life without fear,</i>

58:19.874 --> 58:22.919
then you would be able
to move on. And that the fear

58:22.919 --> 58:24.337
- is what's holding you back.
- That's right.

58:24.337 --> 58:27.132
There are multiple movies
on this topic,

58:27.132 --> 58:29.801
from, like, the '40s and on.

58:29.801 --> 58:32.095
"You die. You're suspended.
Where are you going?

58:32.095 --> 58:33.555
You're going to Heaven.
Is there a Heaven?

58:33.555 --> 58:35.598
Is there a God?
Is there an afterlife?"

58:35.598 --> 58:36.975
<i>To me,</i> Defending Your Life

58:36.975 --> 58:39.561
<i>is the finest piece of work
on that topic.</i>

58:39.561 --> 58:41.479
Look what I found?
- Come on. Give me that.

58:41.479 --> 58:42.522
Make me.

58:44.733 --> 58:46.067
Wow.

58:46.067 --> 58:48.486
Come on, chicken.

58:48.486 --> 58:52.073
You stick up for yourself,
low-life chicken.

58:52.073 --> 58:54.659
<i>You see,
every second of every lifetime</i>

58:54.659 --> 58:56.578
<i>is always recorded.</i>

58:56.578 --> 58:59.539
And as each one ends,
we sort of look at it.

58:59.539 --> 59:02.751
Look at a few of the days,
examine it,

59:02.751 --> 59:05.837
and then if everybody agrees,
you move forward.

59:05.837 --> 59:07.547
What do you mean "move forward"?

59:07.547 --> 59:09.132
<i>As an astrophysicist,</i>

59:09.132 --> 59:13.345
<i>Defending Your Life</i> was one
of the most insightful films

59:13.345 --> 59:15.472
I had ever seen.

59:15.472 --> 59:18.808
I measure the value
of a movie to me

59:18.808 --> 59:21.895
by how much influence it has
over my thoughts.

59:21.895 --> 59:24.689
<i>The claim is that
as a human being on Earth,</i>

59:24.689 --> 59:27.942
<i>we're using some small percent
of our total brain power.</i>

59:27.942 --> 59:29.944
His attorney,
who's defending his life,

59:29.944 --> 59:32.697
is using, like,
45 or 50 percent

59:32.697 --> 59:33.865
of his brain power.

59:33.865 --> 59:35.492
But there's still
higher levels beyond that.

59:35.492 --> 59:38.203
For example,
I use 48 percent of my brain.

59:38.203 --> 59:39.704
Do you know how much you use?

59:41.623 --> 59:43.375
Forty-seven?

59:43.375 --> 59:46.544
- Three.
- I'm sorry?

59:46.544 --> 59:50.715
And the lawyer says,
"I am deeply simplifying

59:50.715 --> 59:53.385
my communication,
so that you can understand me."

59:53.385 --> 59:55.637
Where were you?
I'm just curious.

59:55.637 --> 59:57.430
I'd tell you
but you wouldn't understand.

59:57.430 --> 01:00:00.558
Don't treat me like a moron.
Try me.

01:00:00.558 --> 01:00:02.227
I was trapped
near the inner circle

01:00:02.227 --> 01:00:03.937
of thought.

01:00:03.937 --> 01:00:06.022
- I don't understand.
- I told you.

01:00:06.022 --> 01:00:09.651
And it's because of that scene,
I've always been thinking

01:00:09.651 --> 01:00:12.779
about how stupid
we may actually be

01:00:12.779 --> 01:00:16.074
on the spectrum of intelligence
in the universe.

01:00:16.074 --> 01:00:19.244
- Hi. How'd you die?
- On stage, like you.

01:00:21.162 --> 01:00:23.873
<i>You and Meryl Streep
are incredible together.</i>

01:00:23.873 --> 01:00:25.625
<i>How did she wind up
in that movie?</i>

01:00:25.625 --> 01:00:27.293
Well, I was friends
with Carrie Fisher.

01:00:27.293 --> 01:00:30.630
<i>And she had a party,
and Meryl Streep was there,</i>

01:00:30.630 --> 01:00:35.010
and I was surprised
how easygoing she was.

01:00:35.010 --> 01:00:37.220
And I said,
"I just finished something

01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:38.763
I'm really excited about it."

01:00:38.763 --> 01:00:41.182
<i>And I don't know
if it was half-joking or real,</i>

01:00:41.182 --> 01:00:43.768
she said,
"Is there a part in it for me?"

01:00:43.768 --> 01:00:47.439
I said, "Yeah. Right. Okay."

01:00:47.439 --> 01:00:50.442
And I went home
and I thought, "God, yes!"

01:00:50.442 --> 01:00:51.568
Yeah, yeah.

01:00:51.568 --> 01:00:53.945
I don't know what this is.

01:00:55.155 --> 01:00:56.239

01:01:06.833 --> 01:01:10.128
But I've been defending myself
so hard these last few days

01:01:10.128 --> 01:01:13.214
and I just don't wanna be judged anymore.

01:01:13.214 --> 01:01:16.426
I have this wonderful feeling
inside of me but I'm af--

01:01:18.053 --> 01:01:20.388
I'm just tired of being judged.

your way?

01:03:10.081 --> 01:03:14.127

you know,
"How do you find someone?"

01:03:16.254 --> 01:03:19.257

the answer is you stop looking.

01:03:19.257 --> 01:03:22.719
Albert, you were one of the last
bachelors to go in Hollywood.

01:03:22.719 --> 01:03:24.929
- You waited a long time.
- That's right.

- you'd been with?
- Yes!

01:03:33.855 --> 01:03:35.440
I guess this wasn't
the romantic way to put it,

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:38.651
but after two days,
I looked right in her eyes

01:03:38.651 --> 01:03:40.779
and I said,
"You're the first woman

01:03:40.779 --> 01:03:42.572
I'm willing
to be divorced from."

01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:50.121
I met Kimberly

01:03:50.121 --> 01:03:51.998
<i>Yeah. How did you meet her?</i>

01:03:51.998 --> 01:03:54.668
I was set up by friends. Yeah.

01:03:54.668 --> 01:03:56.336
And she called it a blind date,

01:03:56.336 --> 01:03:58.797
and yet <i>Defending Your Life</i>
was her favorite movie,

01:03:58.797 --> 01:04:00.799
so I said,
"Well, it was a one-eyed date."

01:04:00.799 --> 01:04:01.966
Yes.

01:04:01.966 --> 01:04:04.719
I thought the movie was amazing.
And I said,

01:04:04.719 --> 01:04:08.640
"This man wrote,
directed, and starred in this?

01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:10.100
That's the kind of guy
I wanna marry."

01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:11.559
I swear to God I said that.

01:04:11.559 --> 01:04:12.769
Really?
- Yeah.

01:04:12.769 --> 01:04:15.105
But I was filming
in San Francisco, <i>Mother.</i>

01:04:15.105 --> 01:04:16.773
Right.
- So, we talked on the phone

01:04:16.773 --> 01:04:18.650
for ages.
But I'll tell you, one of these,

01:04:18.650 --> 01:04:20.985
I'm not a big coincidence guy.

01:04:20.985 --> 01:04:23.029
Yeah.
- But this was interesting.

01:04:23.029 --> 01:04:28.034
<i>I wrote</i> Mother <i>before I met her,
and she came from Marin,</i>

01:04:28.034 --> 01:04:30.328

01:04:30.328 --> 01:04:31.996
<i>More importantly...

01:04:31.996 --> 01:04:35.500
...I set the character
at Tam High,

01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:38.878
- where she went to high school.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:04:38.878 --> 01:04:40.213
So, that was weird!

01:04:40.213 --> 01:04:42.924
Our hour-long conversations
became, you know,

01:04:42.924 --> 01:04:44.634
eight-hour long conversations

01:04:44.634 --> 01:04:46.177

till I cried

01:04:46.177 --> 01:04:47.846
but this was
before the internet.

01:04:47.846 --> 01:04:49.472
He had no idea
what I looked like.

01:04:49.472 --> 01:04:52.475
So, we kind of fell in love
by talking.

01:04:52.475 --> 01:04:53.768
And we talked on the phone

01:04:53.768 --> 01:04:55.770
and it was great, great,
great, great, great.

01:04:55.770 --> 01:04:57.272
We met and it was great.

01:04:57.272 --> 01:05:03.695
And, you know, I had waited
and knew that I couldn't--

01:05:03.695 --> 01:05:05.363
shouldn't be waiting
too much longer.

01:05:05.363 --> 01:05:06.865
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:05:06.865 --> 01:05:08.158
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

01:05:08.158 --> 01:05:09.367
My line was,

01:05:09.367 --> 01:05:12.328
"I'm gonna have to look
for high schools with ramps."

01:05:15.331 --> 01:05:16.207
"Is Dad coming?"

01:05:16.207 --> 01:05:18.209
"He's wheeling up.
He's wheeling up."

01:05:18.209 --> 01:05:20.712
The chemistry,
everything was there

01:05:20.712 --> 01:05:21.921
the minute we met.

01:05:21.921 --> 01:05:24.549
Somehow,
I don't know how it happened,

01:05:24.549 --> 01:05:26.009
but we were, like, making out

01:05:26.009 --> 01:05:28.053
to the soundtrack
of <i>Schindler's List.</i>

01:05:29.387 --> 01:05:31.014
That's true.

01:05:31.014 --> 01:05:32.390
It was worth waiting for.

01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:34.225
Yeah, yeah.
- That's all I can say.

01:05:34.225 --> 01:05:35.602
<i>And I said,
"Well, look,</i>

01:05:35.602 --> 01:05:38.813
<i>I don't know why you've waited
but this is what I want.</i>

01:05:38.813 --> 01:05:41.066
<i>I wanna get married,
you know, have kids.</i>

01:05:41.066 --> 01:05:42.442
<i>The whole nine yards."</i>

01:05:42.442 --> 01:05:45.695
So, then he kept saying,
"Well, why don't you move in?"

01:05:45.695 --> 01:05:47.113
Like, when we were dating.

01:05:47.113 --> 01:05:51.201
And I kept going like this,
"It's so empty there, isn't it?

01:05:51.201 --> 01:05:54.579
Like, do you see anything?"
You know, like, every time.

01:05:54.579 --> 01:05:58.625
And then he said, "Okay,
I'll take you to Tiffany's."

01:05:58.625 --> 01:06:02.170
And I was like, "Ah, ah, I need
to hear the whole sentence.

01:06:02.170 --> 01:06:04.798
Like, you need to get on a knee.
Like, you need to do it."

01:06:04.798 --> 01:06:07.050
And so then he did it. Wow.

01:06:07.050 --> 01:06:09.010
She thinks I proposed.
I actually tripped.

01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:12.263
- You were on your knees--
- That's right.

01:06:12.263 --> 01:06:14.432
I dropped a contact lens,
bent down to pick it up

01:06:14.432 --> 01:06:16.017
- and she said, "Yes."
- And you got married.

01:06:16.017 --> 01:06:17.560
Yeah.

01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.104
<i>I've known you so long,</i>

01:06:19.104 --> 01:06:22.732
<i>and when you met Kimberly
and you got married</i>

01:06:22.732 --> 01:06:24.150
and you had kids,

01:06:24.150 --> 01:06:27.612
I thought, "This is a big thing
for Albert,"

01:06:27.612 --> 01:06:31.449
because you didn't see
that evolution for you.

01:06:31.449 --> 01:06:33.284
I was sick of me.

01:06:33.284 --> 01:06:36.496
I mean, if I couldn't do this
for somebody,

01:06:36.496 --> 01:06:38.039
I think I would never have

01:06:38.039 --> 01:06:40.208
left my home past fifty.
Right, right.

01:06:40.208 --> 01:06:42.961
<i>And so you have Jake,
you have Claire,</i>

01:06:42.961 --> 01:06:45.005
<i>and now all of a sudden
you're a father.</i>

01:06:45.005 --> 01:06:46.840
<i>How are you adjusting to that?</i>

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:49.092
I couldn't imagine
a life without it.

01:06:49.092 --> 01:06:52.303
Now, do your kids know
that you're that Albert Brooks?

01:06:52.303 --> 01:06:55.432
I-- I haven't really shown them
the movies yet

01:06:55.432 --> 01:06:57.809
because they--

01:06:57.809 --> 01:07:01.980
I don't wanna see them
not like it.

01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:04.190
'Cause then I'd have
to punish them severely.

01:07:05.984 --> 01:07:07.277
In my will, David,

01:07:07.277 --> 01:07:10.989
I have a detailed questionnaire
about my movies.

01:07:12.824 --> 01:07:14.701
And if they can't answer it...

01:07:14.701 --> 01:07:16.119
- Very shrewd.
- There's nothing.

01:07:16.119 --> 01:07:17.328
- There's nothing.
- I think you're on

01:07:17.328 --> 01:07:18.830
- to something there.
- Right. There's nothing.

01:07:18.830 --> 01:07:22.584
- A only mark.
- All right, and action!

01:07:22.584 --> 01:07:24.127
She's a muse.

01:07:24.502 --> 01:07:25.545
Come on.

01:07:25.545 --> 01:07:28.298
No. I-- I met her at a party
a couple of years ago.

01:07:28.298 --> 01:07:30.675
- Rob Reiner introduced us.
- Rob Reiner?

01:07:30.675 --> 01:07:31.968
<i>The idea of the film</i>

01:07:31.968 --> 01:07:34.179
is that there's this woman
who's a muse

01:07:34.179 --> 01:07:37.182
who can get the best things
out of people,

01:07:37.182 --> 01:07:38.975
so they can do their best work.

01:07:38.975 --> 01:07:41.436
That's right.
When you start believing that,

01:07:41.436 --> 01:07:43.980
it becomes something.
Right, right.

01:07:43.980 --> 01:07:46.024
It's the ultimate placebo.

01:07:46.024 --> 01:07:47.442
I can see why you need me.

01:07:47.442 --> 01:07:48.985
When he called me,
I was just, like...

01:07:48.985 --> 01:07:51.696
"Oh, my God,
it's Albert Brooks!"

01:07:51.696 --> 01:07:55.200
You have a lot of talent.

01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:57.369
It's just that
you're losing your edge.

01:07:57.369 --> 01:07:59.829
Jesus, I am hearing this
from everybody.

01:07:59.829 --> 01:08:01.122
That's because it's true.

01:08:01.122 --> 01:08:03.541
And I said, "Oh, I'm in!"
And he goes,

01:08:03.541 --> 01:08:05.960
"You don't even need
to see the script?"

01:08:05.960 --> 01:08:07.379
And I'm like, "No."

01:08:07.379 --> 01:08:10.173
<i>Sharon was so receptive.</i>

01:08:10.173 --> 01:08:12.634
And so much fun to work with.
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

01:08:12.634 --> 01:08:17.097
Just really, ideas and energy.
I was crazy about her.

01:08:17.097 --> 01:08:19.057
- Say that to them.
- Everything is her.

01:08:19.057 --> 01:08:21.476
Everything.

01:08:21.476 --> 01:08:23.895
We had
this really wonderful trust

01:08:23.895 --> 01:08:25.313
right from the start.

01:08:25.313 --> 01:08:27.232
There's this scene
where I get in bed

01:08:27.232 --> 01:08:28.566
with Andie MacDowell.

01:08:28.566 --> 01:08:31.152
So, what side of the bed
do you want?

01:08:31.152 --> 01:08:33.822
Oh, you're gonna sleep
in the bed too?

01:08:33.822 --> 01:08:36.449
And I said,
"So, I wanna be naked."

01:08:36.449 --> 01:08:39.244
And he went,
"I don't know. I don't know."

01:08:39.244 --> 01:08:40.704
He kept covering his eyes.
His eyes?

01:08:40.704 --> 01:08:42.872
Yeah, like, "I-- I don't know
if I can--

01:08:42.872 --> 01:08:44.165
I don't know if I can see that."

01:08:44.165 --> 01:08:45.583
You want the whole bed?

01:08:45.583 --> 01:08:48.336
Well, hey, it's your house,
you know? Whatever you wanna do.

01:08:48.336 --> 01:08:50.672
Oh, my God.
You want the whole bed?

01:08:50.922 --> 01:08:52.173
Take it.

01:08:52.173 --> 01:08:54.134
And then you had Scorsese.

01:08:54.134 --> 01:08:55.719
<i>Yeah, we have
these famous directors</i>

01:08:55.719 --> 01:08:58.513
<i>all thinking that they might
get help from this fraud.</i>

01:08:58.513 --> 01:09:00.181
Just tell him
Marty was here, okay?

01:09:00.181 --> 01:09:02.308
'Cause I gotta get
this thing figured out.
I'm right in the middle of it.

01:09:02.308 --> 01:09:04.185
- I gotta get it figured out.
- What are you working on?

01:09:04.185 --> 01:09:05.437
- Promise you won't tell anybody?
- Yeah.

01:09:05.437 --> 01:09:06.938
I'm working on a remake
of <i>Raging Bull.</i>

01:09:06.938 --> 01:09:08.356
- Really?
- Yeah. Only this time,

01:09:08.356 --> 01:09:10.734
I'm doing it with
a real thin guy. Real thin.

01:09:10.734 --> 01:09:12.444
- Can you see it?
- Yeah. I see it.

01:09:12.444 --> 01:09:14.154
- Thin. Thin. Thin.
- Thin and angry. Thin and angry.

01:09:14.154 --> 01:09:16.031
Thin and angry.
Is there a Starbucks near here?

01:09:16.031 --> 01:09:17.449
Oh, gee, I'd be careful
if I were you.

01:09:17.449 --> 01:09:20.243
- You might have had your quota.
- Yeah. I guess I'd-- Quota?

01:09:20.243 --> 01:09:21.619
That gives me an idea
for something else entirely.

01:09:21.619 --> 01:09:22.996
Thank you.
We never had this conversation.

01:09:22.996 --> 01:09:24.581

We never spoke.

to the water anytime soon.

01:09:29.044 --> 01:09:31.671

01:09:32.130 --> 01:09:33.298
No.

01:09:33.298 --> 01:09:37.635
Stay away from the water.
Don't go near the water.

01:09:37.635 --> 01:09:39.846
And me. I was-- Yeah. Yeah.

Albert
is a totally trained actor.

01:09:59.824 --> 01:10:02.660
He has all that technique.
He has all those tools.

01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:03.828
He can do anything.

Okay. Just a minute. All right.

That taxi driver
has been staring at us.

01:10:13.672 --> 01:10:14.756
What taxi driver?

01:10:14.756 --> 01:10:17.300
That one.
The one that's sitting there.

01:10:17.300 --> 01:10:18.551
How long
has he been there?

01:10:18.551 --> 01:10:21.096
I don't know
but it feels like a long time.

01:10:21.096 --> 01:10:23.431
My first acting movie
was <i>Taxi Driver.</i>

01:10:23.431 --> 01:10:24.849
<i>Right. Scorsese.</i>

01:10:24.849 --> 01:10:27.227
<i>That was a hell
of a movie to have starred in.</i>

01:10:27.227 --> 01:10:30.063
Why did they think
Albert Brooks would be perfect

01:10:30.063 --> 01:10:31.773
for a movie about Travis Bickle?

01:10:31.773 --> 01:10:34.359
You know, I think
Scorsese had seen plenty of me

01:10:34.359 --> 01:10:37.612
on the variety shows.
And he loved comedy

01:10:37.612 --> 01:10:39.614
<i>and he sensed
that I could do it.</i>

01:10:39.614 --> 01:10:44.452
<i>But to me, just going to the set
on days I wasn't working</i>

01:10:44.452 --> 01:10:46.830
<i>and watching Marty,
it was a thrilling experience.</i>

01:10:46.830 --> 01:10:48.081
Why won't you talk to me?

01:10:48.081 --> 01:10:49.332
- Come on.
- Why won't you talk to me?

01:10:49.332 --> 01:10:51.001
Why don't you answer my calls
when I call you?

01:10:51.001 --> 01:10:52.252
You think I don't know
you're here?

01:10:52.252 --> 01:10:53.628
- Let's not have any trouble.
- You think I don't know?

01:10:53.628 --> 01:10:55.171
You think I don't know?
Would you please leave?

01:10:55.171 --> 01:10:56.381
- Get your hands off me.
- Okay. Then leave.

Please. Just please.

Get your hands--
Okay.

01:11:02.429 --> 01:11:04.139
- Get your hands off!
- Okay. Then just leave!

01:11:04.139 --> 01:11:05.557
- Take 'em off!
- All right. Just leave then.

01:11:05.557 --> 01:11:06.850
What made you decide

01:11:06.850 --> 01:11:09.352
that he was the guy you wanted
for <i>Broadcast News?</i>

01:11:09.352 --> 01:11:11.271
Oh, not decision. Just--

01:11:11.271 --> 01:11:13.064
We talked about it
through the writing.

01:11:13.064 --> 01:11:15.025
I mean, there was nobody else.

01:11:15.025 --> 01:11:17.235
You can't end up with Tom

01:11:17.235 --> 01:11:19.362
because it totally goes
against everything

01:11:19.362 --> 01:11:20.739
that you're about.

01:11:23.450 --> 01:11:25.618
I know you care about him.

01:11:26.578 --> 01:11:28.872
I've never seen you
like this with anybody.

01:11:28.872 --> 01:11:33.084
So, don't get me wrong
when I tell you that Tom,

01:11:33.084 --> 01:11:35.420
while being a very nice guy...

01:11:36.921 --> 01:11:37.797
is the devil.

01:11:37.797 --> 01:11:42.260
I wanna talk
about this very specific moment

01:11:42.260 --> 01:11:44.429
in <i>Broadcast News,</i>

01:11:44.429 --> 01:11:47.891
and it's famous because anybody
who gets nervous,

01:11:47.891 --> 01:11:51.102
they say, "You're sweating
just like Albert Brooks."

01:11:51.102 --> 01:11:53.605
Tell me how
that moment came to be.

01:11:53.605 --> 01:11:59.611
In the original script,
Jim didn't have sweating.

01:11:59.611 --> 01:12:04.199
<i>It was Aaron
has a horrible failure.</i>

01:12:04.199 --> 01:12:05.450
<i>Right. Yeah.</i>

01:12:05.450 --> 01:12:07.327
<i>You're anchoring it,
taking William Hurt's place.</i>

01:12:07.327 --> 01:12:09.412
<i>Right. And one night,</i>

01:12:09.412 --> 01:12:14.250
I saw at midnight,
a new guy on CNN.

01:12:14.250 --> 01:12:16.628
Albert called me one day,
so excited,

01:12:16.628 --> 01:12:19.589
and he said, "I just saw a guy
on CNN sweating bullets."

01:12:19.589 --> 01:12:23.510
I woke Jim up.
"Jim! Jim! Turn on CNN!

01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:26.096
I know what we-- This is it!"
And it worked.

01:12:26.096 --> 01:12:27.514
It worked.
Wow, wow, wow.

01:12:27.514 --> 01:12:31.851
The British foreign secretary
today, pounced on what he termed

01:12:31.851 --> 01:12:35.814
"The nest of professional spies
and amateur traders

01:12:35.814 --> 01:12:37.899
who are turning
NATO headquarters

01:12:37.899 --> 01:12:39.317
into an instrument

01:12:39.317 --> 01:12:41.528
whose only true function
is folly."

01:12:41.528 --> 01:12:44.489
Just how noticeable
is this, huh?

01:12:44.489 --> 01:12:46.116
<i>Albert really trashed</i>

01:12:46.116 --> 01:12:48.576
the shirt and the jacket
that night.

01:12:48.576 --> 01:12:50.954
But for years afterward,

01:12:50.954 --> 01:12:55.333
and after anyone sees it now,
contemporaneously today...

01:12:55.333 --> 01:12:56.459
Five seconds!

01:12:56.459 --> 01:12:58.336
<i>...people will find a way
to ask you,</i>

01:12:58.336 --> 01:13:00.714
<i>"Were you more like
the William Hurt character</i>

01:13:00.714 --> 01:13:03.633
or were you
the sweaty intellectual?"

01:13:03.633 --> 01:13:06.428
<i>A hundred and twenty people
were reported injured.</i>

01:13:06.428 --> 01:13:08.680
<i>At least 22 people dead.</i>

01:13:08.680 --> 01:13:11.766
Commercial.
<i>- I wish I were one of them.</i>

01:13:11.766 --> 01:13:14.352
I think that his performance
in <i>Broadcast News</i>

01:13:14.352 --> 01:13:18.189
is just the North Star
for almost everything.

01:13:18.189 --> 01:13:19.607
There's a lot of people
that feel like,

01:13:19.607 --> 01:13:21.317
"I'm kind of a decent person,

01:13:21.317 --> 01:13:24.195
and why do I always get
passed over?"

01:13:24.195 --> 01:13:26.948
Wouldn't this be a great world
if insecurity and desperation

01:13:26.948 --> 01:13:31.536
made us more attractive?
If needy were a turn-on?

01:13:31.536 --> 01:13:34.622
- Call if you get weird.
- Mm.

01:13:34.622 --> 01:13:36.666
We thought we were Albert Brooks
in that relationship.

01:13:36.666 --> 01:13:39.044
<i>No comedy people thought
they were William Hurt.</i>

01:13:39.044 --> 01:13:42.255
I thought Albert and Holly
sort of stole the show.

01:13:42.255 --> 01:13:45.717
Hey, Aaron!
I think you're the devil!

01:13:45.717 --> 01:13:48.345
- You know I'm not!
- How?

01:13:48.345 --> 01:13:50.472
Because I think
we have the kind of friendship

01:13:50.472 --> 01:13:51.598
where if I were the devil,

01:13:51.598 --> 01:13:54.142
you'd be the only one
I would tell.

01:13:54.142 --> 01:13:56.478
Well, you were awfully quick
to run after Tom's help

01:13:56.478 --> 01:13:58.938
- when you wanted help!

they flew me up to Pixar.

01:18:36.007 --> 01:18:39.344
And they did the cutest thing
I've ever seen.

01:18:39.344 --> 01:18:41.721
They took a scene
from <i>Defending Your Life</i>

01:18:41.721 --> 01:18:44.182

Well, actually,
that's a common misconception.

01:18:58.822 --> 01:19:01.032
Clownfish are no funnier
than any other fish.

01:19:01.032 --> 01:19:02.992
There's a story I heard that, uh,

01:19:02.992 --> 01:19:04.369
<i>when you went
to the first preview--</i>

01:19:04.369 --> 01:19:08.707
It was the premier.
And I think Jake was maybe four.

01:19:08.707 --> 01:19:11.084
- Right.
- And after that fish

01:19:11.084 --> 01:19:16.715
killed everybody but my one son,
he ran out of the theater.

01:19:16.715 --> 01:19:18.591
I was old enough
to kind of understand

01:19:18.591 --> 01:19:20.385
that, like,
that was my dad's voice.

01:19:20.385 --> 01:19:24.347
But I was young enough to--
to not understand what I was.

01:19:24.347 --> 01:19:25.390
And my mom would say,

01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:27.892
"That's you. That's Daddy.
That's you. That's you."

01:19:27.892 --> 01:19:28.977
Then I go to the movie.

01:19:28.977 --> 01:19:30.812
And in my mind,
I'm genuinely Nemo.

01:19:30.812 --> 01:19:32.439
Like, I'm the fish.
There's no difference.

01:19:32.439 --> 01:19:34.065
And then one scene in,

01:19:34.065 --> 01:19:36.526
<i>the mom gets, like,
murdered by this fish.</i>

01:19:36.526 --> 01:19:38.361

01:19:38.361 --> 01:19:40.155
<i>And I'm crying,
and we had to leave.</i>

01:19:40.155 --> 01:19:42.073
Then my mom had to be like,
"No, no, no!

01:19:42.073 --> 01:19:44.159
I'm here. I'm here.
It's not real."

01:22:14.559 --> 01:22:17.604
If you speak English,
would you raise your hand?

01:22:17.604 --> 01:22:22.192
How many? All of you? Oh, God.

01:22:22.192 --> 01:22:24.277
The picture was supposed
to come out in the fall.

01:22:24.277 --> 01:22:27.906
They had made all the posters.
They had made everything.

01:22:27.906 --> 01:22:29.908
Then the Danish cartoons happened.

01:22:29.908 --> 01:22:33.536
- Oh, yes, yes.
- And Sony said,

01:22:33.536 --> 01:22:37.165
"We can't release a movie
with the word 'Muslim' in it."

01:22:37.165 --> 01:22:39.668
<i>And they said,
"If you don't change it</i>

01:22:39.668 --> 01:22:43.171
<i>to</i> Looking for Comedy,
<i>we're not gonna release it."</i>

01:22:43.171 --> 01:22:48.510
And I said, "I made the movie
for the title. It's the point."

01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:53.348
<i>So, after a big studio drops you
for a specific reason,</i>

01:22:53.348 --> 01:22:56.393
other studios start to go,
"Maybe they know something.

01:22:56.393 --> 01:22:57.852
- Why do we wanna--"
- Yeah, yeah.

01:22:57.852 --> 01:22:59.938
So, anyway,
they threw us to the curb

01:22:59.938 --> 01:23:02.774
and we went
with Warner Independent.

01:23:02.774 --> 01:23:04.693
- Right.
- I remember, we had a meeting.

01:23:04.693 --> 01:23:05.944
You know, these meetings

01:23:05.944 --> 01:23:08.446
where they give you
the advertising plan.

01:23:08.446 --> 01:23:11.282
And I came in
and I was waiting for, you know,

01:23:11.282 --> 01:23:13.201
what television stations, what--

01:23:13.201 --> 01:23:15.787
And they were trying
to make it a good thing.

01:23:15.787 --> 01:23:17.622
"We're not gonna go TV."

01:23:17.622 --> 01:23:19.082
"Really?"

01:23:19.082 --> 01:23:21.459
"No, no. The world's changing.

01:23:21.459 --> 01:23:24.796
We're gonna do something
much more interesting."

01:23:24.796 --> 01:23:26.047
"What?"

01:23:26.047 --> 01:23:29.384
<i>"Well, we're gonna do
a little thing on Jdate."</i>

01:23:30.135 --> 01:23:33.847
"Oh, God!" And you leave saying,

01:23:33.847 --> 01:23:36.808
"It's dead.
There's nothing I can do."

01:23:36.808 --> 01:23:38.059
Wow. Wow.

01:23:38.059 --> 01:23:39.894
Now, let me tell you
the funny thing.

01:23:39.894 --> 01:23:41.479
You know where
the movie premiered?

01:23:41.479 --> 01:23:43.773
<i>At the Dubai Film Festival. Wow.</i>

01:23:43.773 --> 01:23:47.444
They asked me to watch it
with the head, the sheikh.

01:23:47.444 --> 01:23:48.445
Right.

01:23:48.445 --> 01:23:50.905
So, I went up there
into this little balcony.

01:23:50.905 --> 01:23:53.283
It's five of his friends

01:23:53.283 --> 01:23:56.578
and five women sitting
in the other section.

01:23:56.578 --> 01:23:59.164
And people were just
on the phone the whole time.

01:23:59.164 --> 01:24:01.666
- Wow. Yeah, yeah.
- But I had a joke in that movie

01:24:01.666 --> 01:24:04.336
that I was waiting to see
what they would do.

01:24:04.336 --> 01:24:07.672
And that's when I was in India
interviewing assistants.

01:24:07.672 --> 01:24:10.759
<i>I interviewed one after another
after another.</i>

01:24:10.759 --> 01:24:12.886
And this one woman came

01:24:12.886 --> 01:24:14.429
and I asked her
all these questions.

01:24:14.429 --> 01:24:16.139
"Do you think you know--
Do you know the city?

01:24:16.139 --> 01:24:17.390
Can you type?"

01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:19.184
And then she said,
"I can do all of that.

01:24:19.184 --> 01:24:20.643
I have a question for you."

01:24:20.643 --> 01:24:22.228
You're not a Jew, are you?

01:24:24.647 --> 01:24:29.319
Um... not... this minute.

01:24:29.319 --> 01:24:32.238
I mean, sometimes I-- I am.

01:24:32.238 --> 01:24:33.823
How much of the time?

01:24:33.823 --> 01:24:35.617
Part-time.

01:24:35.617 --> 01:24:40.163
And I was waiting for that,
sitting next to the sheikh.

01:24:40.163 --> 01:24:41.956
You know,
and he got off his phone.

01:24:41.956 --> 01:24:44.292
"You're not a Jew, are you?"
Off the phone.

01:24:44.292 --> 01:24:47.587
Looked up at the screen.
"Not all the time."

01:24:47.587 --> 01:24:49.047
Big laugh. Wow.

01:24:49.047 --> 01:24:50.799
Big laugh from the women. Wow.

01:24:50.799 --> 01:24:52.217
Back to the phones.

01:24:53.134 --> 01:24:54.469
<i>I mean,
I'm listening to all of this</i>

01:24:54.469 --> 01:24:57.472
and I'm getting a person
who's been defending his life.

01:24:57.472 --> 01:24:59.015
You've been defending yourself
against--

01:24:59.015 --> 01:25:01.351
Every goddamn minute. Yeah.

01:25:01.351 --> 01:25:03.561
And it still doesn't stop.
Yeah. Yeah.

01:25:03.561 --> 01:25:06.481
It just enters another phase
of defending.

01:25:06.481 --> 01:25:07.440
Yeah.

01:25:07.440 --> 01:25:11.444
I had a very famous agent
and he said to me,

01:25:11.444 --> 01:25:15.073
"I don't know why
you always take the hard road."

01:25:15.073 --> 01:25:17.325
Yeah, yeah.
- And my answer was,

01:25:17.325 --> 01:25:20.286
"You think I see two roads...

01:25:21.204 --> 01:25:22.706
and I don't."
Wow.

01:25:22.706 --> 01:25:26.626
"If there was an easy road,
I'd have a house there."

01:25:26.626 --> 01:25:28.545
I said,
"What do you think, I get up,

01:25:28.545 --> 01:25:31.548
I can't wait
for the goddamn trouble

01:25:31.548 --> 01:25:32.924
I'm gonna get into?"

01:25:32.924 --> 01:25:36.386
I said,
"I don't see-- I see one road!"

01:25:36.386 --> 01:25:42.726
This... is the real me.

01:25:43.226 --> 01:25:44.811
Thank you very much.

01:25:44.811 --> 01:25:47.272
I hope to see you again
some time.

the first time
I met him was here.

01:26:15.383 --> 01:26:17.469
At-- at our house?
- Yeah.

01:26:17.469 --> 01:26:21.473
And he came up, and he said some
nice complimentary things to me.

01:26:21.473 --> 01:26:24.893
And I thought,
"Oh, well--" I mean, that was--

01:26:24.893 --> 01:26:27.395
that was a big night for me...
Yeah. Yeah.

01:26:27.395 --> 01:26:31.274
...that I had
Albert Brooks's approval.

01:26:31.274 --> 01:26:33.318
Wow.
- That really meant a lot to me.

01:26:33.318 --> 01:26:35.904
I-- I met Albert
with Garry Shandling.

01:26:35.904 --> 01:26:37.697
And we went out
to dinner with him.

01:26:37.697 --> 01:26:38.656
I remember I went home

01:26:38.656 --> 01:26:40.867
and wrote down
everything Albert said.

01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:45.372
I think my main memory of him
is, like, him in the house

01:26:45.372 --> 01:26:48.500
in a bathrobe, like,
kind of just moseying around,

01:26:48.500 --> 01:26:51.002
but he had this, like,
lion brain where he would just,

01:26:51.002 --> 01:26:53.338
like, you know,
he's so freaking smart.

01:26:53.338 --> 01:26:57.258
I am, like, the hardest
to get a laugh out of,

01:26:57.258 --> 01:27:01.554
so he always likes to imitate me
when he tells jokes

01:27:01.554 --> 01:27:03.932
and it's like--
You know?

01:27:03.932 --> 01:27:05.100
That's it.

01:27:05.100 --> 01:27:08.353
He's such a mensch, you know?
Such a mensch.

01:27:08.353 --> 01:27:11.773
When I was, like, invited
to go on a walk with him,

01:27:11.773 --> 01:27:16.194
it was like-- I felt like
I had done something right

01:27:16.194 --> 01:27:17.862
in my comedic career.

01:27:17.862 --> 01:27:20.031
He suggested,
"Well, we could get together."

01:27:20.031 --> 01:27:21.366
And he said, "You know,

01:27:21.366 --> 01:27:25.245
if that's not a good time
for you, you can say 'No.'"

01:27:25.245 --> 01:27:27.455
He said, "You won't be hurting
my feelings."

01:27:27.455 --> 01:27:29.374
He said, "I left my feelings

01:27:29.374 --> 01:27:32.168
on the Warner Brothers lot
in 1978."

01:27:34.421 --> 01:27:37.048
I think he unapologetically
played to the band,

01:27:37.048 --> 01:27:38.258
you know, which was cool.

01:27:38.258 --> 01:27:39.884
If you're watching it,
you enjoyed it.

01:27:39.884 --> 01:27:42.429
Because if you got it,
you really felt special.

01:27:42.429 --> 01:27:45.557
Just fearless, funny.

01:27:45.557 --> 01:27:48.393
He's so fucking hot.

01:27:48.393 --> 01:27:50.020
He got a wife?
Yes.

01:27:50.020 --> 01:27:51.354
Yeah. Okay.

01:27:51.354 --> 01:27:53.982
Well, you know, I was gonna
offer up my uterus but...

01:27:53.982 --> 01:27:55.358
I see.
- ...I'm cool.

01:27:55.358 --> 01:27:56.735
If I could get one tattoo,

01:27:56.735 --> 01:27:59.612
maybe I'd get the nest egg
tattooed somewhere on my body.

01:27:59.612 --> 01:28:03.867
He will always be
a filmmaker's filmmaker.

01:28:03.867 --> 01:28:07.203
You had to put him with Woody
and Chaplin and those people

01:28:07.203 --> 01:28:09.289
who controlled all parts
of their film,

01:28:09.289 --> 01:28:11.082
who made it
an extension of themselves.

01:28:11.082 --> 01:28:12.876
And what you didn't want
to happen

01:28:12.876 --> 01:28:14.544
watching an Albert Brooks movie,

01:28:14.544 --> 01:28:16.129
you'd never wanted the scenes

01:28:16.129 --> 01:28:17.547
to ever end. Wow.

01:28:17.547 --> 01:28:19.507
It's just a body
of work over time

01:28:19.507 --> 01:28:24.262
that is so singular,
and impressive, and hilarious,

01:28:24.262 --> 01:28:26.306
and heartbreaking.

01:28:26.306 --> 01:28:29.267
I would rather have
Albert's career than my career.
