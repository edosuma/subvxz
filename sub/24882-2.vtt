00:15.133 --> 00:17.567
- ¡Hola!
- Hello!

00:17.567 --> 00:19.133
I'm glad
you're all here.

00:19.133 --> 00:23.066
Can you guess what we are
going to be finding out
about today?

00:23.066 --> 00:25.066
Uh, gophers?

00:25.066 --> 00:28.066
No. No gophers,
but I'll give you a hint.

00:28.066 --> 00:30.734
It has something to do
with all of you.

00:30.734 --> 00:32.200
- All of us?
- Flower pots?

00:32.200 --> 00:33.900
Well,
that's a puzzler.

00:33.900 --> 00:37.300
I'm gonna go out
on a limb here
and say shoes.

00:37.300 --> 00:40.033
That's it!
That's right!
You're all shoes!

00:40.033 --> 00:43.100
Stick around for more shoes
today on "Sesame Street."

00:43.100 --> 00:45.166
Wow.
This should be good.

Oh. ¡Hola!
Welcome to "Sesame Street."

01:25.600 --> 01:28.266
It's me, Rosita.

01:28.266 --> 01:33.600
I thought maybe
you didn't recognize me
because I'm all dressed up.

01:33.600 --> 01:36.233
I'm even wearing
my favorite shoes.

01:36.233 --> 01:37.667
See?

01:37.667 --> 01:40.900
On both feet.
Heh heh heh.

01:40.900 --> 01:44.433
That is because today
is muy importante.

01:44.433 --> 01:47.934
There's going
to be a new shoe store
on "Sesame Street,"

01:47.934 --> 01:51.567
and guess
whose store it is.

01:51.567 --> 01:55.667
Cinderella!
And she's coming here today.

01:55.667 --> 01:58.066
Oh, oh, excuse me.

01:58.066 --> 02:00.166
Have you seen
a young lady go by?

02:00.166 --> 02:02.433
She would have been
wearing a crown.

02:02.433 --> 02:04.300
She's-- oh,
she's beautiful...

02:04.300 --> 02:07.800
- Uh-huh.
- She's stunning,
and she's so elegant.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.800
- Oh, really?
- Yes!

02:09.800 --> 02:12.333
- Have you seen her?
- No, no, no, no.
I'm sorry.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.834
I haven't seen
anyone like that.

02:13.834 --> 02:15.100
Thank you,
young monster.

02:15.100 --> 02:17.233
- Oh, you're welcome.
- Where could she be?

02:17.233 --> 02:19.400
Oh. Mmm.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.467
( whimpering )

02:21.467 --> 02:23.533
Your Majesty?

02:23.533 --> 02:25.166
Hello?

02:27.467 --> 02:29.734
Aha.

02:29.734 --> 02:32.000
Cinderella?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.900
I know you're back there.

02:33.900 --> 02:35.100
Hee hee hee!

02:35.100 --> 02:36.800
Aw, how did
you find me?

02:36.800 --> 02:39.700
Hoo hoo!
Your slipper,
Your Majesty.

02:39.700 --> 02:42.166
Oh, these shoes!

02:42.166 --> 02:44.400
Ugh. I wish
they would stay on.

02:44.400 --> 02:45.467
Duke:
Well, yeah.

02:45.467 --> 02:46.867
- Oh, Duke?
- Hmm?

02:46.867 --> 02:49.033
Now it's your turn
to play hide-and-seek.

02:49.033 --> 02:51.600
Oh, ho ho!
But, Your Wonderfulness, no.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.100
There's no time, silly.

02:54.100 --> 02:55.700
You have to open up
the shoe store

02:55.700 --> 02:57.233
in a matter of moments!

02:57.233 --> 02:59.433
Oh, but I don't want
to open up the shoe store.

02:59.433 --> 03:00.533
What?

03:00.533 --> 03:01.600
I don't want to be
a princess anymore.

03:01.600 --> 03:02.667
It's no fun!

03:02.667 --> 03:05.200
But-- but, Cinderella,
how can you say that?

03:05.200 --> 03:08.767
Because I never get to play
and my feet really hurt.

03:08.767 --> 03:11.066
But-- but--
but you can't quit.

03:11.066 --> 03:12.900
I won't let you!

03:12.900 --> 03:14.734
- Really?
- Really.

03:14.734 --> 03:16.533
Oh, look!
Glitter!

03:16.533 --> 03:17.867
Glitter? Where?

03:17.867 --> 03:19.066
Hee hee hee!

03:20.867 --> 03:22.867
Oh! Oh!

03:22.867 --> 03:24.433
Every time.

03:24.433 --> 03:25.934
Where is she now?

03:25.934 --> 03:27.700
Ohh.

03:27.700 --> 03:29.266
Where can I hide,
where can I hide?

03:29.266 --> 03:31.867
- Ohh! Ohh!
- Oh, oh!

03:31.867 --> 03:33.400
Oh, I'm so sorry.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.800
I guess they don't call them
slippers for nothing.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.100
Oh, ha ha ha!

03:37.100 --> 03:38.500
Do you know
a good place to hide?

03:38.500 --> 03:40.734
Oh. Are you playing
hide-and-seek?

03:40.734 --> 03:42.400
Uh, yeah, sort of.

03:42.400 --> 03:43.800
Oh, of course I know
a good place to hide.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.033
- Come on!
- Okay, great.

03:45.033 --> 03:47.200
Rosita:
Come on, follow me.

the coast is clear.

- Yeah.

04:03.333 --> 04:04.834
Ha ha ha!

04:04.834 --> 04:06.834
That was such
a great hiding space.

you need shoes like mine.

09:40.734 --> 09:42.433
- Whoo!

09:42.433 --> 09:45.433
Ooh, it's 12:00.
It's time to cut the ribbon
and open the store!

09:45.433 --> 09:47.233
W-w-w-w-now,
wait a minute.

09:47.233 --> 09:51.166
So you haven't quit
being a princess?

09:51.166 --> 09:53.000
No, Duke,
Rosita helped me realize

09:53.000 --> 09:55.533
that shoes don't have
to be fancy to be good.

09:55.533 --> 09:58.400
With the right shoes,
I can be a princess and play!

09:58.400 --> 09:59.700
( all laughing )

09:59.700 --> 10:01.166
Rosita, do you want
to help me cut the ribbon?

10:01.166 --> 10:02.667
- Really? Me?
- Yeah!

10:02.667 --> 10:04.667
- Yes, yes, yes, yes!
- Come on!

10:04.667 --> 10:05.767
Come on, everybody.

10:05.767 --> 10:07.400

10:07.400 --> 10:12.166

they have those sneakers
in my size, 11 1/2 wide!

10:12.166 --> 10:14.467
Oh! The ribbon!

10:14.467 --> 10:16.066

10:18.633 --> 10:20.567

10:22.800 --> 10:25.400
Everybody loves
your shoe store.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.834
I know it's amazing,
but you know what the best
part of today was?

10:27.834 --> 10:29.500
- What?
- Making a new friend.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.200
Aww, Cinderella.

10:31.200 --> 10:32.867
Oh, do you want
to go play hopscotch?

10:32.867 --> 10:34.233
- Sure!
- Oh, I'll race you!

10:34.233 --> 10:35.600
Oh, yeah!

10:35.600 --> 10:36.834
( cheering, applause )

10:36.834 --> 10:38.467
Duke:
That's not very elegant.

10:45.400 --> 10:49.066
Did you see
a kind moment today?

10:49.066 --> 10:51.500
Cinderella:
Oh, oh! A hopscotch board.

10:51.500 --> 10:53.000
- Yes!
- You go first, okay?

10:53.000 --> 10:54.867
Oh, how kind of you.

10:54.867 --> 10:57.166
Elmo:
It's kind to play
with a friend

10:57.166 --> 10:58.967
and take turns.

11:03.900 --> 11:06.967
Yay, kindness!
Yeah-eah-eah!

"S" is for shoes.

12:07.834 --> 12:10.533
There are so many
different kinds of shoes.

12:12.900 --> 12:16.166
And people wear them
for different reasons.

12:21.600 --> 12:23.734
These hiking boots
protect your feet

12:23.734 --> 12:25.600
from twigs and rocks.

12:27.567 --> 12:30.600
Flip-flops are fun
to wear in the summer,

12:30.600 --> 12:34.633
and they even come
in really cool colors.

12:34.633 --> 12:38.300
These rain boots keep
your feet dry when it rains

12:38.300 --> 12:40.734
and when jumping
in puddles.

12:42.333 --> 12:44.900
Sometimes, you can wear
dressy shoes

12:44.900 --> 12:46.767
to go to a fancy party.

12:48.567 --> 12:50.300
Soccer cleats have
little spikes on the bottom

12:50.300 --> 12:52.633
to keep you
from slipping on the grass.

12:53.967 --> 12:56.567
These toe shoes
help ballet dancers

12:56.567 --> 12:58.734
dance on their tippy toes.

13:00.767 --> 13:03.033
And these sneakers
are the perfect shoes

13:03.033 --> 13:05.033
for riding my scooter in.

13:06.867 --> 13:08.600

Hello, Cookie Monster
and Gonger.

13:35.734 --> 13:37.200
I'm Sally.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.867
I'd like a cranberry muffin
with breakfast.

13:39.867 --> 13:41.767
Can you help me, please?

13:41.767 --> 13:46.000
Of course we can help you,
because we are...

13:46.000 --> 13:48.500
Monster foodies!

13:48.500 --> 13:53.400
Okay, what we need
to make cranberry muffin,
Chef Gonger?

13:53.400 --> 13:54.834
We don't need
to make them.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.734
They're already done,
Cookie!

13:56.734 --> 13:58.233
- Already done?
- Yeah.

13:58.233 --> 14:00.800
Wow, that fast.

14:00.800 --> 14:04.467
Cookie, did you eat
the cranbaberry muffin?

14:04.467 --> 14:08.033
Is tall, fluffy cookie
called a muffin?

14:08.033 --> 14:09.333
Yes!

14:09.333 --> 14:11.567
- Then me ate
cranberry muffin.
- Ohh.

14:11.567 --> 14:13.600
Learn something new
every day, huh?

14:13.600 --> 14:15.700
Okay, let's see.
We need egg,

14:15.700 --> 14:18.900
we need milk,
we need "cranbaberry."

14:18.900 --> 14:21.133
Uh-oh!

14:21.133 --> 14:24.800
We're all out
of cranbaberries!

14:24.800 --> 14:26.734
Out of cranberries?

14:26.734 --> 14:29.433
Well, uh, where
we get more cranberries?

14:29.433 --> 14:31.300
Ohh-- ooh!
I'll show you!

14:31.300 --> 14:32.567
Come on!

14:32.567 --> 14:34.667
Okay!
Oh, now. Okay.

14:41.600 --> 14:45.066
Both:
To the cranbaberries!

14:49.734 --> 14:51.367
( cow moos )

14:54.934 --> 14:56.667
Cookie Monster:
Uh, where the cranberry trees?

14:56.667 --> 14:59.333
Uh, all me see
is lots of lumpy, red water.

14:59.333 --> 15:01.667
Hello, Cookie Monster
and Gonger.

15:01.667 --> 15:03.667
Welcome to
the cranberry bog.

15:03.667 --> 15:05.266
Cookie Monster:
Hello, Miss Farmer!

15:05.266 --> 15:07.867
We need cranberries.
Can you help us, please?

15:07.867 --> 15:10.667
Sure.
Come with me.

15:10.667 --> 15:13.333
Cookie Monster:
Oh, big shoes.

15:13.333 --> 15:14.700
That's right!

15:14.700 --> 15:16.767
You need special shoes
called waders

15:16.767 --> 15:18.333
to farm cranberries.

15:18.333 --> 15:19.834
Cranberries
are a healthy fruit

15:19.834 --> 15:22.100
that grow on vines
low to the ground.

15:22.100 --> 15:24.834
For most of the year,
cranberries grow and ripen

15:24.834 --> 15:26.834
on dry land.

15:26.834 --> 15:28.834
When the cranberries
are ready to be picked,

15:28.834 --> 15:31.934
the field is flooded
with water.

15:31.934 --> 15:34.333
Then a machine
called a harvester

15:34.333 --> 15:37.000
knocks the berries
off the vine.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.133
Once the berries
are knocked off,

15:39.133 --> 15:41.266
they float to the top.

15:41.266 --> 15:45.133
Then we wade into the water
and push them

15:45.133 --> 15:47.100
towards a special tube

15:47.100 --> 15:50.433
that sucks them in

15:50.433 --> 15:53.367
and drops them
into a truck.

15:53.367 --> 15:55.500
Here you go--
fresh cranberries!

15:55.500 --> 15:57.900
- Enjoy them!
- Cookie Monster:
Thank you, Miss Farmer!

15:57.900 --> 15:58.900
- Gonger: Thank you!
- ( honks )

16:02.066 --> 16:04.567
Okay, we got
the cranberries.

16:04.567 --> 16:06.000
Uh, what we do now?

16:06.000 --> 16:08.133
Uh, oh!
I'll check the recipe!

16:08.133 --> 16:10.800
Gonger:
Um, ooh, we need flour.

16:10.800 --> 16:12.400
Flour.

16:12.400 --> 16:13.533
Okay, there we go.

16:13.533 --> 16:14.967
( coughing )

16:14.967 --> 16:16.467
Okay, sugar!

16:16.467 --> 16:18.367
- Sugar.
- Yeah.

16:18.367 --> 16:20.734
Oh, yeah!
And a little bit
of baking powder.

16:20.734 --> 16:22.133
A little bit
of baking powder.

16:22.133 --> 16:23.800
Come on, I need butter.
Do butter.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.367
Butter. Yes, sir.
Butter. Here we go.

16:25.367 --> 16:26.667
Oh, yeah.

16:26.667 --> 16:28.533

Egg, egg. Where the egg?

16:28.533 --> 16:30.000
Milk, milk. I need the milk!
Come on. Get the milk.

16:30.000 --> 16:31.467
Yes. Milk.
Here we go. Milk.

16:31.467 --> 16:33.266
Ooh, yeah,
and a splash of vanilla.

16:33.266 --> 16:34.867
Okay.
A splash of vanilla!

16:34.867 --> 16:36.233
Not too much!

16:36.233 --> 16:38.533
Wow! Look at him go!

16:40.400 --> 16:41.667

16:41.667 --> 16:45.400

16:45.400 --> 16:46.700

16:46.700 --> 16:48.734
Uh-- oh, boy.

16:48.734 --> 16:49.867

16:49.867 --> 16:52.600
Okay. Okay.

16:54.166 --> 16:55.233

Ohh. Whoa.

16:58.867 --> 17:01.166
Okay, stir them!

17:01.166 --> 17:02.700

17:02.700 --> 17:04.967
Stir them, stir them.

17:04.967 --> 17:07.567
Spoon into the muffin tin!

17:08.734 --> 17:11.367
Okay, Cookie,
put them into the oven.

17:11.367 --> 17:12.500
Okey dokey.

17:12.500 --> 17:14.767
