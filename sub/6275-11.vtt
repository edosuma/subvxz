00:12.333 --> 00:15.083
BUNCHY:
Father Danny--
he's here in L.A.

00:15.166 --> 00:16.083
I seen him.

00:16.166 --> 00:17.083
Remember me?

00:17.166 --> 00:18.333
It's Brendan.

00:18.417 --> 00:19.750
We don't know each other.

00:19.834 --> 00:21.250
I'm sorry.
Are you?

00:21.333 --> 00:24.000
Ray said you'd stolen
a lot of money from Sully.

00:24.083 --> 00:24.750
I did it for this chick,

00:24.834 --> 00:27.750
Claudette, my one true love.

00:27.834 --> 00:29.500
Mick, things have changed.

00:29.583 --> 00:31.250
RAY:
You got photos of Van Miller

00:31.333 --> 00:32.917
tripping his balls off,
hair samples, video.

00:33.000 --> 00:33.875
What the fuck
are you waiting for?

00:33.959 --> 00:36.583
FRANK:
I'm doing it now.

00:36.667 --> 00:37.875
I still remember her
looking up at me.

00:37.959 --> 00:40.458
Before you pulled the trigger?

00:40.542 --> 00:41.875
(over headphones): Yeah.
MICKEY:
Let me get this straight.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.625
No one else knows
about this?

00:44.709 --> 00:45.875
VAN:
I couldn't risk it.

00:47.166 --> 00:48.792
MICKEY:
I'm surprised I could fuck you.

00:48.875 --> 00:51.417
You're really not my type.

00:51.500 --> 00:53.709
I just needed some closure
on this with you.

00:54.917 --> 00:56.125
(quiet sobbing)

00:57.875 --> 00:59.709
So, how'd you find me?

00:59.792 --> 01:01.083
Ray found me.

01:01.166 --> 01:02.625
You got the wrong guy, pal.

01:02.709 --> 01:03.959
What are you
talking about?

01:04.041 --> 01:05.125
Seany boy, are you in there?

01:05.208 --> 01:08.125
I got a great idea
for the ending.

01:08.208 --> 01:09.834
Let me in.
TV NEWSMAN:
A body has been found.

01:09.917 --> 01:10.917
It is believed to be
the body of Sean Walker.

01:11.000 --> 01:13.834
Shame about
Sean Walker.

01:13.917 --> 01:15.834
There's a lunatic
on the loose.

01:15.917 --> 01:17.125
What'd you do?

01:17.208 --> 01:18.417
What did you do?

01:18.500 --> 01:20.458
Raymond, what did you do?

01:30.583 --> 01:33.166
♪ ♪

01:54.667 --> 01:56.291
♪ ♪

02:21.250 --> 02:24.500
Do you think Sully's
coming for us?

02:24.583 --> 02:26.041
Who the hell knows
what he's gonna do?

02:26.125 --> 02:28.917
You got what you need?
Yeah.

02:30.000 --> 02:32.083
(sighs)

02:35.667 --> 02:39.750
I need you to stay
with the family till
you hear from me.

02:45.959 --> 02:48.542
(sighs) Don't let 'em
out of your sight,

02:48.625 --> 02:50.250
all right?

02:50.333 --> 02:51.375
Thanks, Av.

03:16.250 --> 03:18.250
EZRA:
I made the arrangements

03:18.333 --> 03:20.917
for this baby
to come into the world.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.291
And now she's
an orphan.
She has a mother.

03:22.375 --> 03:25.792
That girl who walked behind
Sean carrying a clipboard?

03:25.875 --> 03:26.625
An egg donor

03:26.709 --> 03:28.583
is not a mother.

03:28.667 --> 03:29.959
Deb and I are

03:30.041 --> 03:31.208
the legal guardians.

03:31.291 --> 03:32.583
But I'm not well.

03:32.667 --> 03:35.625
And Deb's too old
to take care of a baby.

03:35.709 --> 03:37.834
Kelly? Kelly?
(baby crying)

03:37.917 --> 03:38.875
Take her, please.
Okay.

03:38.959 --> 03:41.583
Take her. Okay.

03:41.667 --> 03:42.875
It's okay.

03:42.959 --> 03:46.417
Mr. Drexler wants
to know if you'd like
to issue a statement.

03:46.500 --> 03:49.375
Uh, yeah, my client's dead,
I'm in mourning.

03:49.458 --> 03:51.959
(baby crying)
That's my statement.

03:52.041 --> 03:53.959
(baby continues crying)

03:54.041 --> 03:54.959
This is a fucking tragedy.

03:55.041 --> 03:57.709
We've unleashed a monster.

03:57.792 --> 03:59.500
Sully's not getting
any younger.

03:59.583 --> 04:01.458
He doesn't have a
passport; I'll find him.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.291
Your father's still
working for the FBI.

04:03.375 --> 04:04.166
I'm working on that.
How?

04:04.250 --> 04:07.000
Will you give me
a fucking break, Ezra?

04:07.083 --> 04:09.959
I'm doing what I can.
Don't talk to me
like that, Raymond.

04:13.625 --> 04:15.333
We're both upset.

04:15.417 --> 04:16.542
Let's not fight.

04:24.083 --> 04:27.417
I know I'm asking you
to do a horrible thing.

04:27.500 --> 04:28.959
I'm not killing my father.

04:29.041 --> 04:31.333
Sooner or later,
he's gonna get caught--

04:31.417 --> 04:34.500
or Sully-- and it's
gonna come back to us.

04:34.583 --> 04:36.625
Our problems
didn't go away.

04:36.709 --> 04:37.750
They got worse.

04:37.834 --> 04:40.125
(sighs)

04:49.875 --> 04:52.041
(phone ringing)

04:55.000 --> 04:56.500
Yeah.

04:56.583 --> 04:59.041
The next words out of your mouth
better be "Van Miller

04:59.125 --> 05:00.291
is shut down and no longer
working for the FBI."

05:00.375 --> 05:05.041
I gave my ASAC the file, Ray.
I'm waiting.

05:05.125 --> 05:06.125
Waiting for what?

05:06.208 --> 05:07.583
We're a little busy right now

05:07.667 --> 05:09.375
dealing with a dead
Sean fucking Walker.

05:09.458 --> 05:11.625
Course, I'm sure
you know all about that.

05:11.709 --> 05:12.709
What's that supposed to mean?

05:12.792 --> 05:13.667
You tell me.

05:13.750 --> 05:15.208
Van told me he was

05:15.291 --> 05:16.208
investigating you for some
murder involving Walker.

05:16.291 --> 05:18.709
At first I thought
it was one of Van's

05:18.792 --> 05:19.750
paranoid Hollywood fantasies,
but now...

05:19.834 --> 05:20.875
You're an enemy, Frank.

05:20.959 --> 05:23.250
I'm gonna come over
there and pay your ASAC a visit.

05:23.333 --> 05:24.500
Tell him
about all the great service

05:24.583 --> 05:25.542
I've been getting from you.

05:25.625 --> 05:28.375
If I'm going to prison,
you're going with me.

05:28.458 --> 05:28.709
(beep)

05:28.792 --> 05:30.792
Fuck.

05:30.875 --> 05:33.166
(sighs)

05:43.417 --> 05:46.417
Yeah, hey,
I need to speak to you.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.250
Yeah, it's important.

05:48.333 --> 05:51.291
(siren wailing in distance)

05:54.291 --> 05:56.667
(siren approaching)

06:02.291 --> 06:04.083
(knocking)

06:04.166 --> 06:04.750
(siren passing)

06:04.834 --> 06:08.208
(knocking)

06:13.333 --> 06:16.041
(knocking)

06:22.625 --> 06:24.542
(passing truck horn blows)

06:37.709 --> 06:40.417
(smacks lips) What are you,
Jehovah's Witnesses?

06:40.500 --> 06:43.000
LAPD. You Mickey Donovan?

06:43.083 --> 06:45.667
In the flesh.
We'd like to ask you

06:45.750 --> 06:47.458
a few questions
about Sean Walker.

06:47.542 --> 06:49.959
We, uh, found your name
in his appointment book.

06:50.041 --> 06:51.250
You were working for him?
Was working
with him.

06:51.333 --> 06:53.542
We had an overall deal.

06:53.625 --> 06:55.000
Now I guess... that's fucked.

06:55.083 --> 06:56.000
Come in, fellas.

06:56.083 --> 06:59.667
I'll make some Sanka.

06:59.750 --> 07:02.083
(car horn beeps)

07:06.208 --> 07:10.208
(moaning, panting)

07:10.291 --> 07:11.375
God!

07:11.458 --> 07:12.875
Oh, God, I missed you.

07:12.959 --> 07:15.208
I missed this.

07:17.500 --> 07:18.542
(grunts):
Oh...

07:18.625 --> 07:20.000
Wh-What the fuck, Bunch?!

07:20.083 --> 07:22.417
I fucked up.

07:22.500 --> 07:23.834
I fucked up real bad.

07:23.917 --> 07:26.542
Jesus.

07:29.917 --> 07:31.792
(ringtone playing)

07:33.250 --> 07:35.375
Yeah, Terry, what's up?

07:35.458 --> 07:37.250
You need to get over here.
Something's happened.

07:37.333 --> 07:39.125
Christ, Ter, I can't do it.

07:39.208 --> 07:40.208
I'm sorry!

07:40.291 --> 07:41.250
I need you here. Now.

07:41.333 --> 07:43.500
(click)
(quietly):
Shit.

07:46.417 --> 07:48.500
CONOR:
Big football fan.

07:48.583 --> 07:51.041
AVI: So, what, do
you like the Galaxy?

07:51.125 --> 07:53.125
CONOR:
Yeah, Galaxy sucks
without Beckham.

07:53.208 --> 07:54.667
(laughs)
Beckham's a putz.

07:54.750 --> 07:55.333
Mr. Hollywood.

07:55.417 --> 07:58.625
What are you
doing here?

07:58.709 --> 08:00.709
Ray asked me
to come over and look

08:00.792 --> 08:02.041
at your security system.

08:02.125 --> 08:03.834
Go upstairs.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.250
Why?
You heard me.

08:05.333 --> 08:06.208
Go.

08:12.542 --> 08:13.875
What's going on?

08:13.959 --> 08:14.583
Don't know what you mean.

08:14.667 --> 08:17.041
Ray was a lunatic last night.

08:17.125 --> 08:18.500
Mickey showed up all beaten.

08:18.583 --> 08:20.083
Sean Walker's dead.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.875
Something's going on.

08:21.959 --> 08:23.875
Ray won't tell me.
Abby,

08:23.959 --> 08:24.583
I swear,

08:24.667 --> 08:26.667
it's just
a routine upgrade

08:26.750 --> 08:27.917
of your security system.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.750
It's part of my job.

08:29.834 --> 08:33.458
You're a fucking liar
just like my husband.

08:34.458 --> 08:36.917
Get the fuck out of my house.

08:39.166 --> 08:41.792
I'm just gonna look
at your alarm panel.

08:41.875 --> 08:44.250
Ten minutes, okay?

08:47.583 --> 08:48.709
(sighs)

08:48.792 --> 08:50.709
You want some coffee?

08:51.917 --> 08:54.417
Absolutely.

08:54.500 --> 08:56.750
You have cream?

08:56.834 --> 08:59.083
(Ray muttering)

08:59.166 --> 09:01.625
We got trouble.
It's Bunchy.

09:03.041 --> 09:04.875
It's bad, Ray.

09:11.667 --> 09:12.500
BUNCHY:
Don't be mad, Ray.

09:12.583 --> 09:15.625
What'd you do?
It was an accident.

09:15.709 --> 09:18.667
Tell me,
what did you do?
TERRY: Come on, Ray.

09:25.083 --> 09:28.417
What the fuck?

09:28.500 --> 09:29.709
I need help.

09:29.792 --> 09:31.917
Bunchy shot him.

09:32.000 --> 09:33.458
I-I didn't mean to.

09:33.542 --> 09:35.834
FRANCES: I managed
to stop the bleeding for now,

09:35.917 --> 09:37.625
but he needs to get
to a hospital.

09:37.709 --> 09:40.917
(panting): Yes, yes,
a hospital. Please.

09:45.125 --> 09:48.667
(rapid panting)

09:48.750 --> 09:51.000
You have to help me, okay?
I will. Okay.

09:51.083 --> 09:53.417
Just lay back.
(sobs)

09:53.500 --> 09:55.667
I'm sorry, Ray.
All right.

09:55.750 --> 09:57.041
I didn't mean to,
it just happened.

09:57.125 --> 09:58.625
Take it easy, Bunch, please.

09:58.709 --> 09:59.875
What's the nurse doing here?

09:59.959 --> 10:01.208
She showed up
after the fights.

10:01.291 --> 10:02.750
She stayed over.
Get rid of her.

10:02.834 --> 10:04.333
It's all right.
I trust her.

10:04.417 --> 10:06.333
I don't give a fuck
if you trust her, Ter.

10:06.417 --> 10:07.834
She's not family.

10:07.917 --> 10:09.375
We got to deal
with this. Now.

10:09.458 --> 10:10.166
BUNCHY:
Ray?

10:10.250 --> 10:12.792
It's Father Danny.

10:12.875 --> 10:14.417
You recognize him.

10:14.500 --> 10:16.458
Bunch...
He's doing it again.

10:16.542 --> 10:17.625
To another kid.

10:17.709 --> 10:19.041
The same thing he did to me.

10:19.125 --> 10:20.333
I... I had to stop him.

10:20.417 --> 10:22.709
I had to.
I know, I know.

10:22.792 --> 10:23.709
PRIEST:
Don't go! Don't leave me!

10:23.792 --> 10:25.583
FRANCES:
It looks like the bullet wound

10:25.667 --> 10:26.834
went out his back.

10:26.917 --> 10:28.250
Must've missed his major organs

10:28.333 --> 10:29.875
or he'd be dead by now.

10:29.959 --> 10:30.959
I-I stuffed the entrance

10:31.041 --> 10:32.792
and exit wounds
with bandages.

10:32.875 --> 10:35.250
But he needs attention
before he goes into shock.

10:35.333 --> 10:37.125
So, who's gonna call
the ambulance?

10:37.208 --> 10:37.667
Do you want me to?

10:37.750 --> 10:38.333
Wait, wait, wait.

10:38.417 --> 10:40.291
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

10:41.542 --> 10:42.959
It was an accident, all right?

10:44.333 --> 10:45.375
We just got to sort
some things out

10:45.458 --> 10:46.542
before we can let him go.

10:46.625 --> 10:47.875
PRIEST: Help me!
He may die.

10:47.959 --> 10:49.709
Do you care about that?
Of course we do.

10:49.792 --> 10:51.083
What kind of people
do you think we are?

10:51.166 --> 10:52.709
I care.

10:52.792 --> 10:53.083
Please, Frances.

10:53.166 --> 10:54.959
Trust me.

10:55.041 --> 10:56.083
We got to do this our way.

10:56.166 --> 10:58.750
Make sure Bunchy doesn't
get into serious trouble.

10:58.834 --> 11:02.208
Why would he get into trouble
if it was an accident?

11:02.291 --> 11:05.875
It-It's complicated.

11:05.959 --> 11:09.166
We'll take care of it.

11:09.250 --> 11:11.125
Trust me.

11:13.792 --> 11:14.875
All right.

11:16.792 --> 11:19.000
All right.

11:24.875 --> 11:25.625
You're a good man, Terry.

11:25.709 --> 11:28.750
I know you'll do
the right thing.

11:34.291 --> 11:35.583
You got the gun?

11:35.667 --> 11:37.750
Yeah.

11:43.667 --> 11:44.250
Where'd you get it?

11:44.333 --> 11:46.250
The apartment.

11:46.333 --> 11:48.125
Must be Mickey's.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.917
Ray?

11:51.000 --> 11:52.458
Am I going to jail?

11:57.542 --> 11:59.583
No fucking way are
you going to jail.

11:59.667 --> 12:02.458
You hear me?

12:04.208 --> 12:06.041
I promise.

12:17.625 --> 12:18.959
How do you know Walker?

12:19.041 --> 12:19.333
MICKEY:
Met in Boston.

12:19.417 --> 12:21.667
Years ago.

12:21.750 --> 12:24.083
You know his movie
Black Mass?

12:24.166 --> 12:25.250
Yeah.

12:25.333 --> 12:25.792
I was a consultant on it.

12:25.875 --> 12:26.875
Here's your milk.

12:26.959 --> 12:29.333
This is right before
you did time for murder?

12:31.083 --> 12:33.959
I did time.

12:34.041 --> 12:35.375
That part's right.

12:35.458 --> 12:36.500
So, you get
out of prison,

12:36.583 --> 12:37.542
come to L.A.,
and what?

12:37.625 --> 12:39.000
You call Sean Walker?

12:39.083 --> 12:40.375
And just like that,

12:40.458 --> 12:42.083
he gives you a deal
to write a movie?

12:42.166 --> 12:46.417
Actually, we were planning
to work on more than one.

12:46.500 --> 12:47.333
Sounds like you hit the jackpot.

12:47.417 --> 12:48.417
I'm the real thing.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.750
Sean liked that.

12:50.834 --> 12:52.500
What happened to your head?

12:53.166 --> 12:54.500
Oh.

12:54.583 --> 12:57.083
Had a few drinks last night.

12:57.166 --> 12:59.000
Walked right
into that fucking door.

12:59.083 --> 13:00.917
(laughing)

13:01.000 --> 13:02.959
(smacks lips)

13:04.750 --> 13:05.875
Tell me what happened.

13:05.959 --> 13:07.667
PRIEST:
Do you hear me?

13:07.750 --> 13:09.959
Hey!
I was waiting
outside his house.

13:10.041 --> 13:11.834
I'm hurt!
He got in his car.

13:11.917 --> 13:13.458
I jumped in.

13:13.542 --> 13:16.583
I just wanted to talk.

13:16.667 --> 13:18.041
Tell him how it affected me.

13:18.125 --> 13:20.166
But he got all excited.

13:20.250 --> 13:21.709
Started yelling and everything.

13:21.792 --> 13:23.875
And the...
PRIEST: Please!

13:23.959 --> 13:26.166
The gun went off.
What time was it?

13:26.250 --> 13:27.208
What is this, Ray?
A cross-examination?

13:27.291 --> 13:28.458
It's me or the cops, Terry.

13:28.542 --> 13:29.417
What do you want?

13:29.500 --> 13:31.000
What time was it?

13:31.083 --> 13:32.875
5:00? 5:30?

13:32.959 --> 13:33.166
How'd you get there?

13:33.250 --> 13:34.500
How?

13:34.583 --> 13:36.375
Come on, Bunch.

13:36.458 --> 13:38.041
I-I rode my bike.

13:38.125 --> 13:39.750
Where is it?
Where?

13:39.834 --> 13:41.458
RAY: Where's the
fucking bike?!

13:45.417 --> 13:46.417
It's there.

13:46.500 --> 13:48.542
On the sidewalk.

13:48.625 --> 13:50.834
In front of the house.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.375
Oh, fuck.

13:54.291 --> 13:55.500
PRIEST:
Hey!

13:55.583 --> 13:56.917
I'm hurt!

13:57.000 --> 13:58.417
I need help.

13:58.500 --> 14:00.125
He sounds like he's
in a lot of pain.

14:00.208 --> 14:01.959
Who gives a fuck?

14:08.834 --> 14:10.208
Lena?

14:10.291 --> 14:11.667
Hey, boss, I talked
to the manager.

14:11.750 --> 14:13.542
Sully had two guys with him.

14:13.625 --> 14:15.166
And one of them weighed,
like, 300 pounds.

14:15.250 --> 14:17.041
Yeah, that's Tiny.
Does he have a real name?

14:17.125 --> 14:17.417
I can check
the airline manifests.

14:17.500 --> 14:19.250
Drop that.

14:19.333 --> 14:20.625
Something's come up.

14:20.709 --> 14:21.625
I need you to go
to a priest's house

14:21.709 --> 14:24.250
in Hollywood on Wilcox Street.

14:24.333 --> 14:26.458
It's next to a Catholic Church.

14:26.542 --> 14:28.250
You're looking for a bike.

14:28.333 --> 14:29.333
What kind of bike is it?

14:29.417 --> 14:30.417
TERRY: One of those short
bikes that kids ride.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.417
BUNCHY:
It's not!

14:32.500 --> 14:34.166
I'm not a kid
and I ride it!

14:34.250 --> 14:36.625
Pop rode it, right?
Is he a kid?

14:36.709 --> 14:37.750
It's not a fucking kid's bike.

14:37.834 --> 14:39.250
All right.

14:39.333 --> 14:41.333
It's a Raleigh Chopper

14:41.417 --> 14:41.834
with ape hanger handlebars.

14:41.917 --> 14:43.709
Did you hear that?

14:43.792 --> 14:44.667
Yeah, I got it.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.000
Check out the neighborhood.

14:46.083 --> 14:46.750
See if anyone saw anything.

14:46.834 --> 14:49.291
Heard a shot around 5:00 a.m.

14:49.375 --> 14:51.667
Anything weird.

14:52.667 --> 14:55.291
Lena?

14:55.375 --> 14:56.625
It's Bunchy.

14:56.709 --> 14:59.417
It's serious, all right?

14:59.500 --> 15:01.291
Okay. Copy that.

15:01.375 --> 15:02.750
PRIEST:
For God's sake, help me!

15:02.834 --> 15:05.458
Please!
You need to shut up, Father!

15:05.542 --> 15:06.458
Motherfucker.

15:06.542 --> 15:08.458
Somebody, you got
to get me to a hospital.

15:08.542 --> 15:09.500
Shut the fuck up!

15:09.583 --> 15:10.917
Holy Mother of God.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.125
This has been
some terrible mistake.

15:14.208 --> 15:16.083
You think I don't
recognize you, O'Connor?

15:16.166 --> 15:17.709
St. Josephine, South Boston.

15:17.792 --> 15:19.375
No, no, I never
served in Boston.

15:19.458 --> 15:21.500
I'm from Philly.

15:21.583 --> 15:22.500
You're from Philly, huh?

15:22.583 --> 15:24.125
I don't know you.

15:24.208 --> 15:25.750
I don't know
your brother.

15:25.834 --> 15:27.000
You don't know my brother?
No, I don't.

15:27.083 --> 15:28.125
How do you know
he's my brother?

15:28.208 --> 15:29.500
When he brought me here,
he said,

15:29.583 --> 15:32.125
"I have to call my brother."
Terry!

15:32.208 --> 15:33.542
Get in here.

15:33.625 --> 15:35.500
(grunts)

15:35.583 --> 15:39.542
Hold out your hands.

15:39.625 --> 15:40.750
Do it.

15:40.834 --> 15:43.583
Hold up your fucking hands.

15:50.375 --> 15:53.333
Which one did you break when
this fucker tried to rape you?

15:53.417 --> 15:54.667
The right one.

15:59.208 --> 15:59.750
I have arthritis.

15:59.834 --> 16:04.125
I need medical attention.

16:04.208 --> 16:05.750
I don't want
to get anyone into trouble,

16:05.834 --> 16:08.333
but you-you...
you have to help me.

16:08.417 --> 16:09.792
I don't have to do anything.

16:15.667 --> 16:17.208
(groans)

16:22.458 --> 16:26.375
Like the view?

16:26.458 --> 16:28.750
It's beautiful.

16:28.834 --> 16:30.583
What's that got to do
with our security system?

16:30.667 --> 16:31.750
I live in town.

16:31.834 --> 16:34.125
Don't get much fresh air.

16:36.041 --> 16:37.458
You want some eggs?

16:37.542 --> 16:38.041
Sure.

16:38.125 --> 16:39.917
How do you like them?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.750
Mom only does them
scrambled and burnt.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.417
Shut up, Bridg.

16:43.500 --> 16:45.625
I don't like to cook.

16:45.709 --> 16:47.583
It's not my thing.

16:47.667 --> 16:49.208
Well, let me do it.

16:49.291 --> 16:50.792
Seriously?
Sure.

16:50.875 --> 16:52.083
Do you have onion?

16:52.166 --> 16:53.208
Some lox?

16:59.125 --> 16:59.417
Smoked salmon?

16:59.500 --> 17:01.542
Perfect.

17:01.625 --> 17:02.917
Jamey says Sean Walker
was tortured

17:03.000 --> 17:04.375
before they killed him.

17:04.458 --> 17:06.041
Broke both his arms and legs.

17:06.125 --> 17:07.792
I hate his movies.

17:07.875 --> 17:09.750
He's like the old version
of Tommy Wheeler.

17:09.834 --> 17:10.375
(laughs) Not.

17:10.458 --> 17:12.750
Mom?

17:12.834 --> 17:14.208
Is Dad helping the police

17:14.291 --> 17:14.583
find the people that
killed Sean Walker?

17:14.667 --> 17:16.834
Ask Avi.

17:16.917 --> 17:17.959
He knows a lot more

17:18.041 --> 17:19.625
about your father's business
than I do.

17:19.709 --> 17:21.750
Where's the salt?

17:21.834 --> 17:24.709
I hope you solve
this thing.

17:24.792 --> 17:25.750
I fucking loved
Sean Walker.

17:25.834 --> 17:27.750
He was true blue.

17:27.834 --> 17:30.166
A saint.

17:30.250 --> 17:32.291
He had a big charity
over in Africa.

17:32.375 --> 17:33.250
For general mutilation.

17:33.333 --> 17:36.458
Oh, by the way,
where were you last night?

17:36.542 --> 17:40.041
My son owns a boxing gym.

17:40.125 --> 17:41.917
We had Fite Nite,
amateur bouts.

17:42.000 --> 17:42.959
Ended with a bang.

17:43.041 --> 17:44.959
My boy clocked a monster.

17:45.041 --> 17:46.375
The same son?

17:46.458 --> 17:47.333
Another one.

17:47.417 --> 17:48.125
The black one.

17:48.208 --> 17:50.208
You were at the fights
all night?

17:50.291 --> 17:53.375
Maybe I stepped out
for an hour or so.

17:53.458 --> 17:54.959
I suppose you can account
for that time?

17:55.041 --> 17:57.458
Sure. I was with a lady.

17:57.542 --> 17:58.417
That's convenient.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.792
Fun, too.

18:00.875 --> 18:01.917
And what's her name?
How can we contact her?

18:02.000 --> 18:03.792
Uh... (clears throat)

18:03.875 --> 18:05.166
it's a little tricky, fellas.

18:05.250 --> 18:08.375
You see,
she's married.

18:08.458 --> 18:09.792
So I have to finesse
the situation.

18:09.875 --> 18:11.417
We need to hear from her
by the end of the day.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.208
Or we're bringing you in.

18:13.291 --> 18:16.667
I don't know if I can
contact her today.

18:16.750 --> 18:19.667
I'll try my best.
Today.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.208
Hmm.

18:48.291 --> 18:50.667
(cell phone ringing)

18:53.750 --> 18:55.875
Mickey?

18:55.959 --> 18:57.625
It's good to hear your voice.

18:57.709 --> 18:59.166
You, too.

18:59.250 --> 19:00.375
How are you?

19:00.458 --> 19:02.041
Uh, not so good today.

19:02.125 --> 19:04.166
Got myself in a little jam.

19:04.250 --> 19:04.792
To tell you the truth,

19:04.875 --> 19:07.458
I could use some help.

19:07.542 --> 19:10.250
I can't discuss it
over the phone.

19:10.333 --> 19:11.208
Do you think
we could get together?

19:11.291 --> 19:13.875
I don't know--
I have a tennis lesson.

19:13.959 --> 19:15.458
I don't want to alarm you,

19:15.542 --> 19:19.125
but it's a matter
of life and death.

19:21.542 --> 19:23.667
Okay, I can be there
in two hours.

19:23.750 --> 19:26.291
I can't tell you
how much this means to me.

19:33.875 --> 19:36.291
He got all quiet.

19:38.500 --> 19:38.875
What are we gonna do?

19:38.959 --> 19:41.417
Wait for Lena.

19:41.500 --> 19:42.917
How long?

19:43.000 --> 19:45.959
As long as it takes.

19:46.041 --> 19:48.000
We got to make sure
there are no witnesses.

19:48.083 --> 19:50.625
But if we wait too long...

19:50.709 --> 19:51.375
What if he dies, Ray?

19:54.875 --> 19:57.291
(pounding on door)

19:59.250 --> 20:00.542
(groans)
What the hell?

20:04.041 --> 20:07.417
O'CONNOR:
Please help me!

20:07.500 --> 20:09.375
TERRY: All right,
all right!

20:12.959 --> 20:15.709
The fuck's up, Terrance?

20:15.792 --> 20:17.333
It's all right, Pie.
Take the day off.

20:17.417 --> 20:18.542
What are you talking about?

20:18.625 --> 20:20.291
We had 200 people
here last night.

20:20.375 --> 20:21.000
Place is trashed.
I'll do it.

20:21.083 --> 20:23.917
You use too much Clorox.

20:24.000 --> 20:25.458
No one can breathe
when you do it.

20:25.542 --> 20:25.959
Take the day off.

20:26.041 --> 20:28.625
We got it covered.

20:28.709 --> 20:30.750
This is my gym.

20:30.834 --> 20:31.875
I've been cleaning
it for 20 years.

20:31.959 --> 20:35.417
Before he owned it.

20:35.500 --> 20:37.000
What's going on, Terrance?

20:37.083 --> 20:39.125
Please, Pie.

20:39.208 --> 20:40.792
Do me a favor.

20:40.875 --> 20:42.083
Take the day off.

20:43.917 --> 20:44.792
Fine.

20:44.875 --> 20:48.458
The two of you can
live with the stink.

20:48.542 --> 20:49.458
(men yelling upstairs)

20:49.542 --> 20:52.041
O'CONNOR: Help!
BUNCHY: Get over here! Get...

20:52.125 --> 20:53.417
O'CONNOR:
Just let me go. I won't...

20:53.500 --> 20:55.000
BUNCHY:
Father, you can't go.

20:55.083 --> 20:56.792
O'CONNOR:
Let me go!
I won't tell, I swear!

20:56.875 --> 20:58.166
I swear!
What the fuck are you doing?

20:58.250 --> 21:00.417
I told you
to stay away from him.

21:00.500 --> 21:01.667
He tried to get out.

21:01.750 --> 21:03.500
Have some mercy, I beg you.

21:03.583 --> 21:05.166
I'll die back there!

21:05.250 --> 21:08.333
Oh, for God's sake, please!

21:08.417 --> 21:08.500
DARYLL:
What the fuck?

21:11.166 --> 21:12.917
Oh, Jesus!

21:13.000 --> 21:14.917
I thought you
locked the door.
I did.

21:15.000 --> 21:15.750
He's got his own key,
came 'round the back.

21:15.834 --> 21:17.000
He's cold.

21:17.083 --> 21:19.667
He's going into shock.

21:19.750 --> 21:22.750
You got to raise his legs
above his head.
Stay out of it!

21:22.834 --> 21:23.667
O'CONNOR:
Don't take me
back there, please.

21:23.750 --> 21:24.583
Please.

21:24.667 --> 21:26.750
Can we at least put him
on the couch?

21:26.834 --> 21:28.792
Anyone else with a key
you want to tell me about?

21:28.875 --> 21:30.667
No.

21:30.750 --> 21:32.000
All right,
let's pick him up.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.542
You do it.

21:37.291 --> 21:38.542
Okay.

21:38.625 --> 21:39.709
DARYLL:
Oh, watch out,
watch out, watch out.

21:39.792 --> 21:41.000
On three.
One, two...

21:41.083 --> 21:42.041
No!

21:42.125 --> 21:43.125
(cries out, gasps)

21:43.208 --> 21:44.917
He'll die if he goes into shock.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.291
RAY:
Good.

21:46.375 --> 21:47.208
I'll get a blanket.

21:47.291 --> 21:49.667
We got to get him
to a hospital.

21:49.750 --> 21:51.875
Not till we hear from Lena.

21:51.959 --> 21:52.959
So you're a Donovan, huh?

21:53.041 --> 21:54.875
Mick's boy?

21:54.959 --> 21:56.166
Same as you.

21:56.250 --> 21:57.375
All right.

21:57.458 --> 21:59.041
Go clean up the mess
in that locker room.

22:02.792 --> 22:03.959
(O'Connor grunts)

22:07.834 --> 22:09.959
You seeing
anyone, Avi?

22:10.041 --> 22:11.250
Not now.

22:11.333 --> 22:14.166
Ray keeps me busy.

22:14.250 --> 22:17.834
I told you about that
texting at the table.

22:17.917 --> 22:19.333
God.

22:20.000 --> 22:21.166
Busy doing what?

22:21.250 --> 22:23.417
Uh...
(phone chimes)

22:23.500 --> 22:26.709
AVI:
I have to take care of
my mother on the weekends.

22:26.792 --> 22:27.083
What's wrong
with her?

22:27.166 --> 22:28.959
Nothing.

22:29.041 --> 22:30.000
Uh, from Friday to Saturday,

22:30.083 --> 22:32.709
she can't do anything,

22:32.792 --> 22:35.709
like, um...
turn on lights,

22:35.792 --> 22:37.333
um... cook.
Why?

22:37.417 --> 22:38.583
AVI:
Shabbat.

22:38.667 --> 22:39.667
CONOR:
What?

22:39.750 --> 22:41.500
It's the Sabbath, Conor.

22:41.583 --> 22:43.583
Like... Black Sabbath?

22:43.667 --> 22:45.458
That's a band, you idiot.

22:45.542 --> 22:49.208
My mother
is Orthodox.

22:49.291 --> 22:50.709
She keeps kosher.

22:50.792 --> 22:53.667
She can't do anything
on the Sabbath

22:53.750 --> 22:54.125
because it's
the holy day.

22:54.208 --> 22:56.041
A day of rest.

22:56.125 --> 22:57.542
See, why don't we do that?

22:57.625 --> 22:59.208
We're not Jewish.

22:59.291 --> 23:00.625
BRIDGET:
We're not anything.

23:00.709 --> 23:01.917
We don't have any beliefs.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.041
Daddy hates religion.
I do yoga.

23:04.125 --> 23:06.375
That's not a religion.

23:06.458 --> 23:08.000
I'm going
to be a Buddhist.

23:08.083 --> 23:09.208
Mmm.

23:09.291 --> 23:11.166
Um, Lacy asked me to come over

23:11.250 --> 23:13.333
to study
for our chem final, so...

23:13.417 --> 23:14.959
Call me if you
need a ride home.

23:15.041 --> 23:16.250
I don't think you should go.

23:17.125 --> 23:18.083
Mom?

23:18.166 --> 23:20.792
She's going to a friend's.

23:20.875 --> 23:22.792
She needs to stay in the house.

23:22.875 --> 23:24.959
All of you need to stay.

23:26.917 --> 23:27.959
Kids, go upstairs.

23:28.041 --> 23:29.583
What?
Why?

23:29.667 --> 23:31.291
Again?
Just go.

23:37.875 --> 23:39.667
What the hell's going on?

23:39.750 --> 23:42.458
Are we in danger?

23:42.542 --> 23:44.333
I can't talk about it, Abby.

23:44.417 --> 23:46.917
But no one leaves the house
until I hear from Ray.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.834
You think you can keep me
a prisoner in my own house?

23:52.917 --> 23:55.041
Fuck you.

24:00.083 --> 24:01.333
(phone line ringing)

24:01.417 --> 24:02.709
ABBY:
What the hell's going on?

24:02.792 --> 24:04.667
Don't get excited.

24:04.750 --> 24:05.166
Avi says
we can't leave the house.

24:05.250 --> 24:07.083
I just wanted Avi

24:07.166 --> 24:08.166
to be there with you.

24:08.250 --> 24:09.333
In case.
In case what?

24:09.417 --> 24:12.125
Because of Sean.
The press.

24:12.208 --> 24:15.000
Why would the press want to talk
to me about Sean Walker?

24:15.083 --> 24:16.000
You expect me to believe that?

24:16.083 --> 24:18.583
Look, Abs, just stay
there with Avi, okay?

24:18.667 --> 24:21.166
Where are you?
I'm...
Ray?

24:21.250 --> 24:23.125
BUNCHY: He really
doesn't look good.
Is that Bunchy?

24:23.208 --> 24:24.875
TERRY:
Hey, Bunch, you want
to get me some water?

24:24.959 --> 24:25.875
That's Terry.

24:25.959 --> 24:27.375
Are you at the gym?

24:27.458 --> 24:28.542
No. I...
You're a fucking liar.

24:31.792 --> 24:32.917
(exhales)

24:34.125 --> 24:35.333
I'm going into town.

24:35.417 --> 24:37.458
You take care of the kids.

24:37.542 --> 24:38.792
I can't let
you do that.

24:38.875 --> 24:40.542
Get the fuck
out of my way!

24:46.750 --> 24:49.041
Are you gonna lay
your hands on me?

24:49.125 --> 24:50.750
Go ahead.

24:50.834 --> 24:52.458
I fucking dare you.

24:56.208 --> 24:57.458
Conor?

24:57.542 --> 24:58.667
Bridg?

25:02.667 --> 25:03.917
I'm going into town.

25:04.000 --> 25:05.792
Avi's in charge.

25:10.834 --> 25:12.083
(door slams)

25:17.333 --> 25:18.875
TERRY:
He needs a doctor, Raymond.

25:18.959 --> 25:20.417
If he dies,
it's a mortal sin

25:20.500 --> 25:21.709
and we all go to Hell.

25:21.792 --> 25:22.458
You still believe that crap?

25:22.542 --> 25:25.125
After what he did
to our family?

25:25.208 --> 25:27.834
I know killing's wrong,
that's all.

25:27.917 --> 25:29.291
We take him to a hospital,

25:29.375 --> 25:30.583
he turns Bunch in
for shooting him.

25:30.667 --> 25:31.083
Maybe he won't.

25:31.166 --> 25:32.291
Oh, he will.

25:32.375 --> 25:34.917
And then Bunchy goes to prison.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.917
How long you think
he'll survive in there?

25:37.000 --> 25:39.166
Well, I can handle
myself in prison.

25:41.375 --> 25:42.834
We could say I shot him.

25:42.917 --> 25:44.083
What are you talking about?

25:44.166 --> 25:45.542
You've done enough
for this family.

25:45.625 --> 25:46.875
Now it's my turn.

25:46.959 --> 25:48.125
(exhales)

25:48.208 --> 25:50.542
Come on, Ter.

25:54.667 --> 25:55.875
No one's going to prison.

26:26.458 --> 26:26.875
Here, Father.

26:35.542 --> 26:38.125
Thank you, my son.

26:40.917 --> 26:42.583
Your brother's
gonna kill me.

26:45.041 --> 26:47.500
No.

26:47.583 --> 26:48.500
He will
if you don't stop him.

26:48.583 --> 26:52.750
My death will be
a black mark on your soul.

26:52.834 --> 26:54.333
It'll keep you
out of Heaven.

26:54.417 --> 26:56.000
I can't do anything
about that.

26:56.083 --> 26:58.291
Call the police.
I can't.

27:00.417 --> 27:02.417
You seem like a good man.

27:02.500 --> 27:03.750
Why are you doing this?

27:07.125 --> 27:08.542
I'm an alcoholic.

27:08.625 --> 27:10.458
I'm sorry.

27:11.917 --> 27:12.834
And a sexual anorexic.

27:15.375 --> 27:18.000
I have nothing.

27:19.208 --> 27:21.583
My life is fucked.

27:21.667 --> 27:23.375
I just wanted an apology.

27:23.458 --> 27:26.542
I didn't mean to shoot you.

27:26.625 --> 27:27.500
I...

27:27.583 --> 27:28.750
(groans)

27:33.375 --> 27:36.875
I can help you.

27:36.959 --> 27:37.375
You need therapy.

27:37.458 --> 27:39.208
It doesn't help.

27:39.291 --> 27:41.417
A 12-step program.

27:41.500 --> 27:43.417
I could take you
to a meeting.

27:43.500 --> 27:44.375
I'll get you
the help you need.

27:44.458 --> 27:48.750
I know some
good counselors.

27:48.834 --> 27:50.041
Please.

27:51.542 --> 27:53.250
Before he comes back.

27:53.333 --> 27:55.709
Take me out of here.

28:01.500 --> 28:04.291
You told me it was
God in my mouth.

28:08.083 --> 28:10.250
You said...

28:10.333 --> 28:12.458
God was the Host.

28:12.542 --> 28:14.458
And when we take communion,

28:14.542 --> 28:18.709
we put God in our mouth.

28:18.792 --> 28:21.667
When you asked me

28:21.750 --> 28:24.083
to suck your dick,

28:24.166 --> 28:27.917
you said it was
the same thing.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.583
You said I was putting
God in my mouth.

28:30.667 --> 28:33.125
No, that's...
that's not...

28:33.208 --> 28:34.500
I d... I didn't...

28:34.583 --> 28:35.875
You can't just say
you're sorry?

28:37.709 --> 28:38.875
Please.

28:42.875 --> 28:45.041
I wish I could.

28:45.125 --> 28:48.291
I know it would
ease your pain.

28:48.375 --> 28:51.291
But I don't know you.

28:54.083 --> 28:56.083
Arms down.
Raise your right leg.

28:56.166 --> 28:56.959
Sir, turn and face me.

28:57.041 --> 28:58.125
Well, he definitely has
a problem.

28:58.208 --> 29:00.542
I know.

29:00.625 --> 29:01.792
Sir...

29:01.875 --> 29:02.792
(sighs heavily)

29:02.875 --> 29:05.458
He missed a task force
meeting yesterday.

29:05.542 --> 29:07.959
Where'd you get
this file?

29:08.041 --> 29:10.583
A cop friend of mine
pulled him over.

29:10.667 --> 29:11.875
He didn't arrest him...

29:12.000 --> 29:14.083
didn't want to embarrass
the agency.

29:14.166 --> 29:15.291
I mean, you can imagine
how that would've played out

29:15.375 --> 29:19.208
on the evening news: "FBI Agent
Out of His Mind on LSD."

29:20.542 --> 29:23.208
People still do LSD?

29:23.291 --> 29:25.125
Well, apparently Van does.

29:25.208 --> 29:27.959
Nice and straight...
(sighs)

29:28.041 --> 29:30.041
Left leg at a 45-degree angle.
Shit.

29:30.125 --> 29:31.583
Straight. Hang on. Sir...
I hate this.

29:31.667 --> 29:35.208
A fucking career
down the drain.

29:35.667 --> 29:37.208
Bring him in.

29:37.291 --> 29:38.917
All right.

29:41.291 --> 29:42.667
Hey, Frank.

29:42.750 --> 29:44.041
Touch your toes, sir.

29:44.125 --> 29:46.000
Some agents--
they would have sat on

29:46.083 --> 29:48.208
this file and give
Van a second chance.

29:48.291 --> 29:49.834
You don't have a grudge
against him, do you?
No, sir.

29:49.917 --> 29:52.500
I just don't like seeing
a fellow agent

29:52.583 --> 29:54.041
fucking up like this.

29:54.125 --> 29:56.542
It makes us
all look bad.

30:16.291 --> 30:17.417
(phone chimes)

30:24.417 --> 30:25.834
Lena's downstairs.

30:37.959 --> 30:39.166
I didn't find the bike.

30:39.250 --> 30:40.250
I'm guessing
it was stolen.

30:40.333 --> 30:41.667
Witnesses?

30:41.750 --> 30:43.291
Nobody heard
anything unusual.

30:43.375 --> 30:44.583
One old lady did say

30:44.667 --> 30:45.458
she heard a gunshot
some time before dawn,

30:45.542 --> 30:47.667
but she says that
happens all the time.

30:47.750 --> 30:50.250
Okay.
O'CONNOR:
Please!

30:50.333 --> 30:52.792
Help me! I'm hurt!
Is there anything
else I can do?

30:54.166 --> 30:56.250
Take this back to
the office for me.

30:56.333 --> 30:57.417
Okay.
Please! Help me!

30:57.500 --> 30:58.834
And Lena...
Yeah?

30:58.917 --> 30:59.375
Thanks.

30:59.458 --> 31:01.500
You got it.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.417
He's getting bad, Ray.

31:11.500 --> 31:12.500
There were no witnesses.

31:12.583 --> 31:14.417
The bike's gone.

31:14.500 --> 31:15.917
So what does that mean?

31:16.000 --> 31:17.000
It means O'Connor
could disappear

31:17.083 --> 31:19.291
and no one's gonna
connect it to Bunchy.

31:19.375 --> 31:21.333
We have to help him.
I promised Frances.

31:21.417 --> 31:22.542
This is family, Ter,
and I don't give a shit

31:22.625 --> 31:24.792
about your promises.

31:24.875 --> 31:26.083
Who put you
in charge?

31:26.166 --> 31:28.291
You got a better idea?
Sit up.

31:28.375 --> 31:30.083
Wha... what?

31:31.208 --> 31:31.625
Easy...
(yelling)

31:31.709 --> 31:33.458
Listen to me.

31:33.542 --> 31:35.041
(breathing hard)
No more lies.

31:35.125 --> 31:36.458
Tell him you're sorry
for what you did to him.

31:36.542 --> 31:38.792
I didn't do anything.

31:38.875 --> 31:40.709
Just fucking say it.
(yells, sobs)

31:40.792 --> 31:43.333
Tell him you're sorry...
and you live.

31:43.417 --> 31:44.834
Keep up the bullshit,

31:44.917 --> 31:46.083
you're dead.

31:46.166 --> 31:47.125
Stop him.
Don't talk to them!

31:47.208 --> 31:49.208
Don't do... You're good men.
Don't let him do this.

31:49.291 --> 31:50.458
Shut up.

31:50.542 --> 31:51.709
Shut up.
Don't let him
do this...

31:51.792 --> 31:52.583
Shut the fuck up!
DARYLL: Ray, chill!

31:52.667 --> 31:54.125
Just tell him you're sorry!

31:54.208 --> 31:55.625
Chill, Ray!
Tell him you're
fucking sorry!

31:55.709 --> 31:56.959
Chill!

31:57.041 --> 31:59.000
Get off of me!
Get in there.

31:59.083 --> 32:01.542
Fuck off.

32:01.625 --> 32:02.667
TERRY:
You got to cool down, Ray.

32:02.750 --> 32:03.166
We got to think this through.

32:07.625 --> 32:08.917
This is all my fault.

32:09.000 --> 32:10.709
Oh, Christ, Bunch.

32:10.792 --> 32:12.375
Get back out there and
keep an eye on him.

32:12.458 --> 32:15.041
All right.

32:16.583 --> 32:20.000
It happened to me.

32:20.083 --> 32:21.291
Not you,

32:21.375 --> 32:23.208
not you.
Just me.

32:23.291 --> 32:25.917
So there must be
something in me,

32:26.000 --> 32:28.333
something he saw.

32:32.458 --> 32:35.375
'Cause he was nice to me
a lot of the time.

32:35.458 --> 32:37.709
Took me places.

32:37.792 --> 32:40.667
You know,
we went camping.

32:40.750 --> 32:43.166
I never fished before.

32:45.083 --> 32:47.375
It's peaceful.

32:49.125 --> 32:50.542
We went to games...

32:54.375 --> 32:56.166
Maybe I just wanted those things

32:56.250 --> 32:59.166
and that's why I let him
fuck around with me.

32:59.250 --> 33:01.000
It was my fault.

33:03.667 --> 33:04.709
What are you talking about?

33:04.792 --> 33:06.041
How could it be your fault, Ray?

33:06.125 --> 33:07.458
Bucky Fuckin' Dent.

33:07.542 --> 33:10.000
What?

33:10.083 --> 33:11.667
Bucky Fuckin' Dent.

33:11.750 --> 33:13.709
You remember that?
The tiebreaker?

33:13.792 --> 33:15.166
You kidding me? Everyone
in Boston remembers that.

33:19.875 --> 33:22.125
Mickey promised
to take me.

33:22.208 --> 33:23.458
He was living
with Claudette,

33:23.542 --> 33:24.750
but he said
he got tickets.

33:24.834 --> 33:27.166
I waited for him.

33:28.709 --> 33:30.375
I don't know how long.

33:30.458 --> 33:34.250
I walked around the
park over and over.

33:34.333 --> 33:36.417
Thought he'd be standing at
one of those entrances, and...

33:37.458 --> 33:38.583
I could hear the game.

33:38.667 --> 33:41.417
I don't know
how many times

33:41.500 --> 33:44.041
I circled that park before
I realized he wasn't coming.

33:44.667 --> 33:47.125
He forgot,

33:47.208 --> 33:48.291
or he never had the tickets
in the first place.

33:51.417 --> 33:53.667
Just another fucking lie.

33:59.041 --> 34:01.291
When I got home,
O'Connor was leaving.

34:04.208 --> 34:05.959
I found you in your room.

34:06.041 --> 34:11.250
I knew just by
looking at you.

34:11.333 --> 34:13.083
I knew what he'd done to you.

34:16.417 --> 34:18.166
I wasn't there.

34:18.250 --> 34:19.291
I didn't protect you.

34:23.250 --> 34:25.792
It's not your fault, Ray.

34:25.875 --> 34:28.458
You didn't know
what he was.

34:28.542 --> 34:30.208
He had us all fooled.

34:31.834 --> 34:34.333
I want him to apologize.

34:35.792 --> 34:38.959
Then I want to help him.

34:39.041 --> 34:41.417
(video game gunfire)

34:44.667 --> 34:46.208
Oh, dude, you rock.

34:46.291 --> 34:49.458
You got to have quick
hand-eye coordination

34:49.542 --> 34:51.333
to get into the Mossad.

34:51.417 --> 34:52.083
What's that?

34:52.166 --> 34:55.125
It's covert operations
in Israel.

34:55.208 --> 34:56.875
Like Special Ops?

34:56.959 --> 34:58.166
Exactly.

34:58.250 --> 34:59.875
I was 16 when I
went into the army.

34:59.959 --> 35:00.917
I had to lie
about my age.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.875
Anything to get
off the kibbutz.

35:03.959 --> 35:05.166
What's "kibutts"?

35:05.250 --> 35:06.667
Kibbutz.

35:06.750 --> 35:08.166
My parents split up,

35:08.250 --> 35:10.083
and I went with my father
to the kibbutz.

35:10.166 --> 35:11.458
And I hated it.

35:11.542 --> 35:13.500
You had to get
special permission

35:13.583 --> 35:14.583
just to kiss a girl.

35:14.667 --> 35:15.875
Really?

35:15.959 --> 35:17.166
Well, not really.

35:17.250 --> 35:18.667
But almost.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.959
So I went in the army.

35:21.041 --> 35:22.041
It was worse.

35:22.125 --> 35:25.583
But then I started
the Mossad training.

35:25.667 --> 35:27.667
I got to work alone.

35:27.750 --> 35:29.125
They called me the Lone Wolf.

35:30.583 --> 35:32.625
Wow. I want to move to Israel.

35:32.709 --> 35:33.917
Yeah?

35:34.000 --> 35:36.917
Is a Jew the same as a Yid?

35:40.709 --> 35:42.291
RAY:
Get up.

35:55.959 --> 35:57.417
What do you want from me?

35:57.500 --> 36:00.417
You're going to apologize
to my brother.

36:00.500 --> 36:01.750
I told you.

36:01.834 --> 36:03.250
I don't know him.

36:03.333 --> 36:05.208
You're gonna do what
needs to be done.

36:05.291 --> 36:06.542
You understand?
You're gonna tell him
you're sorry.

36:06.625 --> 36:10.000
(grunts)

36:11.458 --> 36:12.834
Look at him.

36:14.667 --> 36:16.792
(sighs)

36:23.166 --> 36:24.583
Tell him who you are.

36:28.417 --> 36:31.583
I'm Father O'Connor
from St. Josephine's.

36:31.667 --> 36:33.125
Father Danny.

36:33.208 --> 36:34.709
That's what the kids
used to call me.

36:34.792 --> 36:36.500
I was close to your mother.

36:36.583 --> 36:38.458
When she got sick,
it was heartbreaking.

36:40.875 --> 36:42.125
All she had
to go through.

36:42.208 --> 36:48.542
You children,
losing her so young.

36:48.625 --> 36:51.166
Your father not around.

36:53.875 --> 36:55.583
I cared for you.

36:57.750 --> 36:59.041
I cared for all of you.

36:59.125 --> 37:02.583
Tell him what else you did.

37:06.875 --> 37:08.917
I had a problem.
I...

37:09.000 --> 37:10.000
I did things that
were inappropriate.

37:10.083 --> 37:11.542
Is that what you call it?

37:11.625 --> 37:13.625
O'CONNOR:
It's an addiction.

37:13.709 --> 37:15.250
I love children.

37:15.333 --> 37:18.834
But... they can be seductive.

37:18.917 --> 37:22.000
They don't mean to be, but...

37:22.083 --> 37:24.000
they're so free and pure.

37:24.083 --> 37:27.959
So you rape 'em?
No. Never.

37:28.041 --> 37:29.750
I'm not a violent person.

37:29.834 --> 37:31.417
No, you just like
fucking little kids.

37:31.500 --> 37:33.125
I've been punished.

37:35.250 --> 37:37.375
I was in treatment
for two years.

37:39.458 --> 37:41.291
They make you take drugs.

37:41.375 --> 37:43.166
Chemical castration.

37:43.250 --> 37:45.667
It kills the compulsion.

37:45.750 --> 37:47.375
I don't hurt
children anymore.

37:47.458 --> 37:51.041
What about that boy
I saw you with?

37:52.458 --> 37:54.041
Miguel?

37:54.125 --> 37:56.667
Oh, I'm tutoring him.

37:56.750 --> 37:57.875
No, you're hurting him.

37:57.959 --> 37:59.291
No, I'm not, I swear.

37:59.375 --> 38:01.166
I didn't hear
an apology.

38:01.250 --> 38:03.333
(sighs)

38:04.667 --> 38:07.000
I said...

38:09.000 --> 38:10.041
if I did anything...
No "if"!

38:10.125 --> 38:11.458
No fucking "if"!

38:14.208 --> 38:16.834
We're all sinners, Ray.

38:16.917 --> 38:20.250
We've all fallen short
in the eyes of God.

38:20.333 --> 38:21.875
Who hasn't hurt someone?

38:21.959 --> 38:24.125
Caused pain?

38:25.625 --> 38:28.625
And we seek forgiveness.

38:31.583 --> 38:33.500
And we find it.

38:47.250 --> 38:49.667
Do you forgive me?

38:54.750 --> 38:56.166
(pounding at door)

38:56.250 --> 38:57.542
(Terry sighs)

38:57.625 --> 39:00.041
Who's that?

39:00.125 --> 39:02.375
Abby.

39:13.166 --> 39:15.125
What's going on?
You have to go.

39:15.208 --> 39:16.458
Why is Avi
at our house?

39:16.542 --> 39:18.834
To protect you.
From what?

39:18.917 --> 39:20.917
I can't talk about
it now, Abs. Please.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.917
O'CONNOR:
Please help me.
I'm hurt.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.375
Please...

39:24.458 --> 39:25.750
Oh, my God.

39:25.834 --> 39:27.792
Abs, wait.

39:27.875 --> 39:29.291
Abs...

39:35.542 --> 39:38.625
O'CONNOR:
Please... don't.

39:38.709 --> 39:39.834
(crying):
Please...

39:39.917 --> 39:42.041
(gasps)

39:48.792 --> 39:49.959
Hi, Abby.

39:52.709 --> 39:53.750
Help me.

40:12.125 --> 40:14.750
I'll wait for you at home.

40:15.959 --> 40:16.917
O'CONNOR:
Don't go.

40:17.000 --> 40:17.792
Don't go!

40:17.875 --> 40:21.291
Please...

40:21.375 --> 40:23.000
I'm hurt!

40:23.083 --> 40:25.458
Don't leave me!

40:25.542 --> 40:26.750
Please!

40:26.834 --> 40:29.750
Daryll... go lock the door.

40:37.709 --> 40:40.000
I can't believe
that you drove up here

40:40.083 --> 40:41.750
just for me.

40:41.834 --> 40:43.000
You'd do
the same for me.

40:43.083 --> 40:44.333
You bet.

40:44.417 --> 40:45.667
Besides,
I like the drive.

40:45.750 --> 40:47.166
A few hours all to myself.

40:47.250 --> 40:51.083
Allen gets
on your nerves, huh?

40:51.166 --> 40:52.333
(laughs)

40:52.417 --> 40:54.875
Relationships
are... tough.

40:54.959 --> 40:56.959
Don't I know it?

40:57.041 --> 40:58.417
Fresh up your drink.

40:58.500 --> 40:58.750
No. Better not.

40:58.834 --> 41:01.125
Come on.

41:01.208 --> 41:02.750
You used to be
a party girl.

41:02.834 --> 41:04.083
I was a good,
churchgoing girl

41:04.166 --> 41:06.166
before I met you.

41:06.250 --> 41:08.166
We had fun.

41:08.250 --> 41:09.500
(laughs)

41:09.583 --> 41:12.458
Remember this?

41:15.792 --> 41:16.875
Does Allen dance with you?

41:16.959 --> 41:18.709
Allen's not the dancing type.

41:18.792 --> 41:19.917
Too bad.

41:20.959 --> 41:23.792
You want to... give it a go
for old time's sake?

41:23.875 --> 41:26.333
Mick, you don't have to go
through all of this.

41:26.417 --> 41:29.250
If you need something,
just ask.

41:31.041 --> 41:33.709
Yeah, o-okay.

41:38.542 --> 41:40.625
I need you to say

41:40.709 --> 41:42.208
that you were
with me last night.

41:42.291 --> 41:45.667
I understand,
it might not be possible.

41:45.750 --> 41:48.458
Maybe you were out,
maybe...

41:48.542 --> 41:51.291
I know your,
your life with Allen...

41:51.375 --> 41:53.709
But if it is possible...

41:53.792 --> 41:55.792
(exhales)

41:55.875 --> 41:58.792
Like I said...

41:58.875 --> 42:00.291
uh, I'm in a jam.

42:08.667 --> 42:10.792
Allen was out of town
last night.

42:10.875 --> 42:12.041
I was home alone.

42:12.125 --> 42:14.917
So...

42:15.000 --> 42:16.542
if I were to say that I drove

42:16.625 --> 42:19.375
into town to see you...

42:19.458 --> 42:21.750
who's to say I didn't?

42:25.417 --> 42:27.709
You would do
that for me?

42:29.959 --> 42:31.750
After all you've done for me?

42:31.834 --> 42:34.083
The money...

42:34.166 --> 42:36.250
Getting me out of Boston
when I was in trouble...

42:36.333 --> 42:38.709
Mick...

42:40.250 --> 42:42.000
I owe you.

42:42.083 --> 42:43.208
(gulping)

42:43.291 --> 42:45.750
(chokes, gasps)

42:48.709 --> 42:50.333
We got to take him
to a hospital now.
(coughs)

42:50.417 --> 42:52.041
I can't wait anymore.

42:52.125 --> 42:54.834
Please, Ray.

42:54.917 --> 42:55.417
If he dies...

42:55.500 --> 42:57.959
I got enough guilt.

42:58.041 --> 42:59.125
I won't tell
anyone

42:59.208 --> 43:00.333
what happened, I promise.

43:00.417 --> 43:01.792
BUNCHY:
See?
He's a liar.

43:01.875 --> 43:03.125
O'CONNOR:
I'm not lying.

43:03.208 --> 43:05.625
I caused your family
enough pain.

43:05.709 --> 43:06.417
Ray.

43:06.500 --> 43:08.000
Please.

43:08.083 --> 43:09.417
We got to.

43:12.291 --> 43:14.250
All right.

43:14.333 --> 43:14.875
But I take him.

43:14.959 --> 43:17.000
Alone.

43:17.083 --> 43:17.333
I go with you.

43:17.417 --> 43:18.667
No.

43:18.750 --> 43:20.917
You stay here, clean up,
look after Bunch.

43:22.875 --> 43:24.709
That's the way
it's gonna be, Ter,

43:24.792 --> 43:25.917
or it's not gonna be at all.

43:26.000 --> 43:28.375
All right.

43:33.500 --> 43:35.333
Get my car, bring
it around back.

43:35.417 --> 43:37.667
We'll load him up there.
Okay.

43:37.750 --> 43:40.083
What's going on?
Don't talk, sit up.

43:40.166 --> 43:41.500
You're gonna take me
to the hospital?

43:41.583 --> 43:42.166
That's what
my brothers want.

43:42.250 --> 43:44.542
You're all taking me?

43:44.625 --> 43:45.583
I'm taking you.

43:45.667 --> 43:47.375
Here, wrap yourself
in that.

43:48.917 --> 43:50.667
He's gonna kill me.

43:50.750 --> 43:53.083
No, he won't hurt you, Father.

43:53.166 --> 43:54.917
TERRY: It's all right.
O'CONNOR: You don't understand.

43:55.000 --> 43:56.792
He won't take me
to the hospital.

43:56.875 --> 43:59.000
I'll never get there.
Yeah, you will.

43:59.083 --> 44:00.041
Yeah, you'll
be all right.

44:00.125 --> 44:01.208
They don't know, do they?

44:01.291 --> 44:02.667
Shut up.

44:02.750 --> 44:03.875
You never told them.

44:03.959 --> 44:06.208
I told you to shut up.

44:06.291 --> 44:08.417
Ray, Don't do this to me.
Shut the fuck up.

44:08.500 --> 44:09.208
Ray...

44:09.291 --> 44:10.083
You...

44:10.166 --> 44:11.500
I loved you.

47:51.750 --> 47:52.625
We're in a hotel.

47:52.709 --> 47:53.959
I think it's in Malibu.

47:54.041 --> 47:54.333
Who's with you?

47:54.417 --> 47:56.291
Avi.

47:56.375 --> 47:57.083
Dad, he's so cool.

47:57.166 --> 47:58.834
He was a special ops in Israel.

47:58.917 --> 48:01.291
I think he killed
a ton of people.

48:01.375 --> 48:02.834
I bet he did.

48:02.917 --> 48:04.500
Dad, can I become a Jew?

I got to go, Con.

48:15.750 --> 48:19.291
I had Avi take
the kids to a hotel.

48:19.375 --> 48:21.625
Okay.

48:21.709 --> 48:23.125
That's all you got to say?

48:31.875 --> 48:34.458
Ray, that priest--
what happened?

48:37.208 --> 48:39.542
You look at me?

48:43.917 --> 48:45.792
Is that the one
that abused Bunchy?

48:50.583 --> 48:52.458
Wasn't only Bunch.

49:00.542 --> 49:02.875
No, no, no.

49:02.959 --> 49:05.291
Don't touch me.

49:15.250 --> 49:16.208
You should probably go.

Everything okay?

49:52.625 --> 49:54.291
Yeah.

49:54.375 --> 49:56.625
So, you took him
to the hospital?

49:56.709 --> 49:58.625
Yeah.

49:58.709 --> 49:59.542
Yeah, yeah.

49:59.625 --> 50:02.291

50:02.375 --> 50:04.750

50:43.083 --> 50:44.709

50:44.792 --> 50:47.750
and I'm guessing it was you,
you motherfucker.

50:47.834 --> 50:49.000
You fucking murdered
an FBI agent, Ray.

50:49.083 --> 50:52.250
I'm gonna take you down for it.
