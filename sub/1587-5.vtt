HlGH SEPTON:
May the Warrior grant him courage

01:58.744 --> 02:01.704
and protect him in these perilous times.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.915
May the Smith grant him strength

02:03.999 --> 02:06.334
that he might bear this heavy burden.

02:06.418 --> 02:08.127
And may the Crone,

02:08.212 --> 02:10.922
she that knows the fate of all men,

02:11.006 --> 02:13.216
show him the path he must walk

02:13.300 --> 02:17.178
and guide him through the dark places
that lie ahead.

02:17.262 --> 02:18.471
ln the light of the Seven,

02:18.555 --> 02:21.641
l now proclaim Tommen
of the House Baratheon,

02:21.725 --> 02:23.267
First of His Name,

02:23.352 --> 02:25.645
King of the Andals and the First Men

02:25.729 --> 02:28.397
and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.486
Long may he reign!

02:33.570 --> 02:35.404
ALL: Long may he reign!

02:55.259 --> 02:57.635

03:06.144 --> 03:11.691
Your Grace.

03:35.799 --> 03:37.884
CROWD: Your Grace.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.151
Your Grace.

03:58.447 --> 04:00.072
There he is.

04:01.283 --> 04:04.327
Long may he reign.

04:08.373 --> 04:11.125
He sits the throne like he was born to it.

04:11.209 --> 04:14.420
Yes. He wasn't, though, was he?

04:15.714 --> 04:16.923
No, he wasn't.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.264
You still mourn for Joffrey?

04:25.349 --> 04:27.266
He was my husband. My king.

04:27.351 --> 04:28.434
He would have been your nightmare.

04:33.357 --> 04:35.566
Your Grace, l feel...

04:35.651 --> 04:37.568
You knew exactly what he was.

04:38.570 --> 04:39.695
l did, too.

04:40.530 --> 04:44.408
You never love anything in the world
the way you love your first child.

04:46.370 --> 04:48.537
Doesn't matter what they do.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.876
And what he did, it shocked me.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.506
Do you think l'm easily shocked?

04:58.590 --> 04:59.799
No.

04:59.883 --> 05:03.219
The things he did shocked me.

05:09.935 --> 05:11.769
He's only a boy.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.064
A good, decent boy. He always has been.

05:16.358 --> 05:19.485
Who was the last decent king, l wonder?

05:19.569 --> 05:23.990
He could be the first man who sits on
that throne in 50 years to actually deserve it.

05:25.742 --> 05:28.786
lt would be some consolation, wouldn't it?

05:28.870 --> 05:31.122
For all the horror that put him there.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.921
He will need help

05:40.007 --> 05:41.924
if he's going to rule well.

05:42.009 --> 05:44.010
He has you.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.344
A mother is not enough.

05:48.432 --> 05:51.100
You're still interested in being queen?

05:51.518 --> 05:52.560
(SCOFFS)

05:53.228 --> 05:54.937
After all that's happened?

05:58.025 --> 06:01.277
lt sounds strange, but l am...

06:01.403 --> 06:05.448
l haven't even given any thought to it,
what comes next.

06:05.532 --> 06:08.451
lt would be a great honour, of course.

06:08.952 --> 06:12.121
But l will have to speak to my father about it.

06:13.498 --> 06:16.125
Yes, speak to your father.

06:17.294 --> 06:19.253
l'll speak to mine.

06:23.675 --> 06:28.137
We may be faced with an alarming number
of weddings soon.

06:28.305 --> 06:30.806
-(CHUCKLES)
-l won't even know what to call you.

06:32.267 --> 06:33.642

06:35.604 --> 06:37.730
Or Mother?

06:38.398 --> 06:39.398
(CHUCKLES)

06:41.651 --> 06:43.736
JORAH: King Joffrey Baratheon is dead.

06:45.864 --> 06:47.490
Murdered at his own wedding.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.785
BARRlSTAN: And we've taken
the Meereenese navy, Your Grace.

06:50.869 --> 06:52.912
The Second Sons took the navy.

06:52.996 --> 06:54.955
Who told you to?

06:55.999 --> 06:57.124
No one.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.585
So why did you do it?

06:59.878 --> 07:01.754
l heard you liked ships.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.343
How many ships?

07:07.427 --> 07:08.761
93, Your Grace.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.304
How many men can they carry?

07:10.388 --> 07:12.890
9,300, not counting sailors.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.809
Would that be enough
to take King's Landing?

07:15.393 --> 07:17.019
The Lannisters have more.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.271
BARRlSTAN: They've been fighting
Joffrey's wars for years.

07:19.439 --> 07:21.190
They're tired, dispersed.

07:21.358 --> 07:23.359
And now their king is dead.

07:23.527 --> 07:26.403
8,000 Unsullied, 2,000 Second Sons

07:27.697 --> 07:29.824
sailing into Blackwater Bay

07:29.908 --> 07:32.493
and storming the gates without warning.

07:35.831 --> 07:38.124
lt's hard to say. lt could be enough.

07:38.375 --> 07:41.502
But we're not fighting to make you
queen of King's Landing.

07:41.586 --> 07:44.588
1 0,000 men can't conquer Westeros.

07:44.673 --> 07:46.340
BARRlSTAN: The old houses
will flock to our queen

07:46.424 --> 07:47.925
when she crosses the Narrow Sea.

07:48.009 --> 07:50.678
JORAH: The old houses will flock to
whichever side they think will win,

07:50.762 --> 07:52.763
as they always have.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.351
There's other news.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.270
From Yunkai.

07:59.354 --> 08:02.273
Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule,

08:02.357 --> 08:04.733
the Wise Masters have
retaken control of the city.

08:05.569 --> 08:08.279
They've reenslaved the freedmen
who stayed behind

08:08.363 --> 08:10.739
and sworn to take revenge against you.

08:12.033 --> 08:13.993
And in Astapor,

08:14.202 --> 08:16.662
the council you installed to rule over the city

08:16.746 --> 08:19.832
has been overthrown
by a butcher named Cleon

08:19.916 --> 08:23.085
who's declared himself
"His lmperial Majesty."

08:25.422 --> 08:27.089
DAENERYS: Please leave me.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.305
Not you, Jorah.

08:46.943 --> 08:51.197
lt appears my liberation of Slaver's Bay
isn't going quite as planned.

08:53.366 --> 08:57.286
You could sail for Westeros
and leave it all behind.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.205
A boy sits on the lron Throne.

08:59.289 --> 09:03.375
A boy many believe to be
a bastard with no right to it.

09:03.460 --> 09:05.836
They've never been more vulnerable.

09:05.921 --> 09:08.631
You counselled me against
rashness once in Qarth.

09:09.507 --> 09:11.300
l didn't listen.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.344
That all worked out well.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.471
(CHUCKLES)

09:20.769 --> 09:23.145
How can l rule seven kingdoms

09:23.480 --> 09:26.982
if l can't control Slaver's Bay?

09:27.067 --> 09:29.860
Why should anyone trust me,

09:30.403 --> 09:32.529
follow me?

09:32.614 --> 09:34.073
You're a Targaryen,

09:34.157 --> 09:36.325
the Mother of Dragons.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.412
l need to be more than that.

09:47.337 --> 09:52.007
l will not let those l have freed
slide back into chains.

09:52.676 --> 09:54.677
l will not sail for Westeros.

09:54.844 --> 09:56.720
What, then?

09:58.139 --> 10:00.391
l will do what queens do.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.063
l will rule.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.309
Pull up your hood.

10:45.562 --> 10:47.521
A memorable shade.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.607
But how would they know?

10:50.692 --> 10:54.320
You know what kind of stories
poor men enjoy the most?

10:54.404 --> 10:57.156
Ones about rich girls they'll never meet.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.912
ls this the only way into the Eyrie?

11:03.997 --> 11:06.206
The mountains are impassable.

11:06.291 --> 11:09.543
lf you want to get to the Eyrie,
you need to go through the Bloody Gate.

11:10.628 --> 11:13.088
lt doesn't matter how large your army is,

11:13.173 --> 11:15.966
if you attack this gate, you do it on this road,

11:16.051 --> 11:17.926
three men abreast,

11:18.011 --> 11:20.512
and get slaughtered like goats.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.474
The first Lords of the Vale didn't have much,

11:23.558 --> 11:27.353
but they had these mountains
and they knew how to use them.

11:27.437 --> 11:29.229
And the fortress they built here
has never been overcome.

11:29.314 --> 11:32.107
Not once in 1 ,000 years.

11:33.109 --> 11:35.986
Know your strengths, use them wisely,

11:36.071 --> 11:39.156
and one man can be worth 1 0,000.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.746
KNlGHT: Who would pass the Bloody Gate?

11:45.830 --> 11:48.749
Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece Alayne.

11:53.546 --> 11:54.797
Stand to.

11:54.881 --> 11:57.174
KNlGHTS: Stand to!

11:58.968 --> 12:00.135
Welcome back, Lord Baelish.

12:43.388 --> 12:44.847
Oh.

12:45.515 --> 12:49.560
l have brought you a gift.

12:53.857 --> 12:55.357
Lord Baelish.

12:55.442 --> 12:58.026
-My lady.
-Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.696
A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.365
lt's a pleasure to make your acquaintance,
Lady Arryn.

13:04.117 --> 13:07.911
-My name is...
-Oh, do take down that hood, child.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.663
Don't you think l know who you are?

13:10.665 --> 13:13.876
You think l'd let my intended
leave the Eyrie on urgent business

13:14.586 --> 13:17.129
without knowing what that business was?

13:18.465 --> 13:22.384
l let him go so he could bring you here to me.

13:26.222 --> 13:28.557
My flesh and blood.

13:30.393 --> 13:32.478
lt's wonderful to meet you, Aunt Lysa.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.688
You mustn't call me that
in front of anyone else.

13:34.772 --> 13:37.524
-l understand.
-No one can know you're here.

13:37.609 --> 13:39.735
lt would put us in a very precarious position.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.361
l would never say a thing.

13:41.446 --> 13:43.655
The Lannisters want to destroy us.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.824
They've been trying for years.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.868
Now they know what it feels like.

13:47.952 --> 13:51.580
Mummy said they killed your mother
and they chopped off your brother's head.

13:53.958 --> 13:56.877
They did, and my father's.

13:57.128 --> 13:59.713
They killed my father, too, with poison.

14:00.882 --> 14:04.092
l wanted to make
the little Lannister baby man fly, (CHUCKLES)

14:04.177 --> 14:05.969
but Mother said l couldn't.

14:06.054 --> 14:07.804
Make him fly?

14:08.515 --> 14:09.723
Through the Moon Door.

14:14.395 --> 14:16.730
LYSA: And on top of everything else,

14:16.814 --> 14:19.149
they made you marry that filthy troll.

14:19.234 --> 14:22.861
They made us both.
Lord Tyrion didn't want to.

14:22.946 --> 14:24.821
LYSA: l don't believe that.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.949
Did he force himself on you?

14:27.742 --> 14:30.285
-No. We never...
-LYSA: Good.

14:30.787 --> 14:33.580
Robin, this is your cousin Sansa.

14:33.665 --> 14:35.624
But you're not to call her Sansa
in front of anyone

14:35.708 --> 14:37.751
but Uncle Petyr and myself.
Do you understand?

14:38.211 --> 14:39.962
Sansa, this is my son Robin.

14:41.464 --> 14:43.298
lt's a pleasure to meet you, Robin.

14:43.591 --> 14:47.427
Robin, show Sansa to her chamber.
Take the back stairs.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.641
Go. We'll speak soon.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.027
What took you so long?

15:04.112 --> 15:06.780
Arranging for the ascension
of King Tommen l,

15:06.864 --> 15:10.325
extricating Sansa, getting her here alive.

15:10.410 --> 15:14.580
She's here. We've spent more than
enough time on her for one evening.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.417
Let's get married tonight.

15:18.668 --> 15:21.253
Ought we not...

15:21.337 --> 15:23.922
...inform the Lords of the Vale
about the ceremony?

15:24.007 --> 15:25.799
(HUFFS) There's only one Lord of the Vale.

-l do think that we could wait until...

15:35.018 --> 15:37.394
l'm done waiting, Petyr.

15:37.478 --> 15:40.772
We had our wedding night many years ago.

15:40.857 --> 15:42.024
Or don't you remember?

15:42.442 --> 15:44.693
Like it was yesterday.

15:44.777 --> 15:49.072
What wife would do for you
the things l've done?

15:49.324 --> 15:52.200
What wife would trust you
the way l've trusted you?

15:52.827 --> 15:54.870
When you gave me those drops

15:54.954 --> 15:57.414
and told me to pour them into Jon's wine,

15:57.540 --> 15:59.041
my husband's wine.

15:59.125 --> 16:02.252
When you told me to write a letter to Cat

Faded into nothing.

16:22.065 --> 16:24.316
Only speaking of it can make it real.

Tonight it is, then.

Let me bathe and dress for the occasion.

Once l'm presentable,
l'll call on the Septon immediately.

16:46.589 --> 16:49.007
l'm warning you.

16:49.092 --> 16:52.469
l'm going to scream when
my husband makes love to me.

CERSEl: As soon as decency permits.

17:29.048 --> 17:33.719
After we've allowed Tommen
the appropriate time to mourn his brother

17:33.803 --> 17:35.470
and Margaery to mourn her husband.

-A fortnight?

l know you don't like them.

17:57.702 --> 17:59.786
l didn't like your husband.

17:59.871 --> 18:02.289
Used to pat me on the back a lot.

18:02.373 --> 18:03.623
l didn't trust him.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.667
We had that in common.

18:05.752 --> 18:10.255
You don't need to make formal alliances
with people you trust.

18:10.339 --> 18:12.841
Then whom can we trust?

18:13.384 --> 18:15.510
Ourselves alone.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.515
The Tyrells

18:20.600 --> 18:24.728
are our only true rivals in terms of resources

18:24.812 --> 18:27.939
and we need them on our side.

18:28.024 --> 18:30.817
Robert wasn't particularly rich.

18:30.902 --> 18:33.528
Robert had me funding him.

18:34.071 --> 18:37.032
Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth.

18:37.116 --> 18:40.577
l suppose that explains
why we did so well in the last one.

18:40.661 --> 18:44.331
Do you know how much gold was mined
in the Westerlands this past year?

18:44.415 --> 18:45.499
Haven't a clue.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.292
Your best guess.

18:48.044 --> 18:50.086
Pounds, tons, ounces?

18:50.171 --> 18:52.380
Doesn't matter. The answer is the same.

18:53.883 --> 18:55.133
Can't be.

18:55.218 --> 18:58.178
Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.389
Then how do we pay for anything?

19:01.474 --> 19:05.602
The crown owes the lron Bank of Braavos
a tremendous amount of money.

19:05.686 --> 19:07.145
How much?

19:08.773 --> 19:10.857
A tremendous amount.

19:12.276 --> 19:16.905
There must be someone at the lron Bank
you can speak to, come to some arrangement.

19:16.989 --> 19:20.367
The lron Bank is the lron Bank.
There is no someone.

19:20.451 --> 19:22.994
Someone does work there.
lt is comprised of people.

19:23.079 --> 19:25.247
And a temple is comprised of stones.

19:25.331 --> 19:28.500
One stone crumbles
and another takes its place.

19:28.584 --> 19:32.921
And the temple holds its form
for 1 ,000 years or more.

19:33.506 --> 19:36.508
That's what the lron Bank is, a temple.

19:36.592 --> 19:40.095
We all live in its shadow
and almost none of us know it.

19:41.264 --> 19:43.473
You can't run from them.
You can't cheat them.

19:43.558 --> 19:46.726
You can't sway them with excuses.

19:46.811 --> 19:50.438
lf you owe them money
and you don't want to crumble yourself,

19:50.523 --> 19:52.107
you pay it back.

19:52.191 --> 19:56.027
Vesting the Tyrells in the crown
will help a great deal.

19:57.071 --> 19:59.614
lt's for the good of the family,
l understand that.

20:03.244 --> 20:05.328
l'm not sure my brothers do.

20:09.625 --> 20:12.836
l know you're building a strong case
against Tyrion.

20:13.546 --> 20:16.089
And as a mother, that is your right.

20:16.173 --> 20:20.510
But as a judge,
l cannot discuss the trial with you.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.929
l respect that.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.183
We don't need to discuss it.

20:30.313 --> 20:34.065
The Lannister legacy
is the only thing that matters.

20:34.150 --> 20:36.568
You've started wars to protect this family.

20:37.695 --> 20:41.990
Turned your back on Jaime
for refusing to contribute to its future.

20:43.117 --> 20:45.535
What does Tyrion deserve

20:45.620 --> 20:47.746
for lighting that future on fire?

20:57.506 --> 20:59.966
ARYA: Joffrey.

21:00.051 --> 21:01.968
Cersei.

21:02.053 --> 21:04.262
Walder Frey.

21:04.347 --> 21:05.388
Meryn Trant.

21:06.349 --> 21:08.099
Tywin Lannister.

21:09.185 --> 21:11.227
The Red Woman.

21:12.146 --> 21:13.688
Beric Dondarrion.

21:15.024 --> 21:17.275
Thoros of Myr.

21:17.360 --> 21:18.693
llyn Payne.

21:19.320 --> 21:20.570
The Mountain.

21:21.030 --> 21:22.614
Would you shut up?

21:23.240 --> 21:26.201
l can't sleep until l say the names.

21:26.285 --> 21:29.788
The names of
every fucking person in Westeros?

21:30.831 --> 21:32.499
Only the ones l'm going to kill.

21:32.583 --> 21:33.667
(CHUCKLES)

21:34.001 --> 21:37.128
Hate's as good a thing as any
to keep a person going.

21:37.213 --> 21:39.214
Better than most.

21:40.841 --> 21:43.718
We come across my brother,

21:43.803 --> 21:46.638
maybe we can both cross a name off our list.

21:49.767 --> 21:52.352
lf he were here right now, what would you do?

22:00.403 --> 22:04.406
l'd tell him to shut the fuck up
so l can get some sleep.

22:08.202 --> 22:12.831
Go on, get it over with,
your list of doomed men.

22:15.084 --> 22:17.210
l'm almost done.

22:17.628 --> 22:19.629
Only one name left.

22:20.464 --> 22:22.132
Go on.

22:30.599 --> 22:31.766
The Hound.

22:39.275 --> 22:40.400
SANSA: Thank you.

22:40.484 --> 22:42.360
Your mother always had a sweet tooth.

22:42.445 --> 22:43.987
-Really?
-Oh, yes.

22:44.071 --> 22:47.157
At suppertime,
she would go straight for honey cakes,

22:47.241 --> 22:48.867
candied almonds, custard.

22:48.951 --> 22:50.410
Anything sweet.

22:50.494 --> 22:54.831
Eventually, your grandfather had to assign
a septa to watch her at meals.

22:54.915 --> 22:57.375
Cat was the firstborn daughter after all.

22:57.460 --> 22:59.002
lt was important that she remain desirable

22:59.086 --> 23:01.629
so Father could arrange a good match for her

23:01.714 --> 23:04.299
and she was starting to get fat.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.968
My mother fat?

23:07.053 --> 23:08.386
(BOTH CHUCKLE LlGHTLY)

23:09.555 --> 23:13.266
She never let me have my pudding
until l'd finished all my proper food.

23:13.517 --> 23:16.603
This is before she married your father
and moved to the North.

23:16.687 --> 23:20.190
By the time you were born,
your father's austerity had become hers.

23:21.067 --> 23:23.151
Marriage changes people.

23:25.321 --> 23:26.321
(GASPS)

23:26.405 --> 23:29.949
l didn't mean for you to stop. Enjoy them.

23:34.163 --> 23:35.955
How do you like them?

23:36.040 --> 23:37.999
They're delicious.

23:41.045 --> 23:43.463
Where did you get the lemons?
You can't grow them up here.

23:43.547 --> 23:45.173
Oh, gods, no.

23:45.257 --> 23:48.426
Petyr had three crates
brought all the way from King's Landing.

23:48.511 --> 23:50.553
He knew you liked lemon cakes.

23:50.638 --> 23:51.930
He's so kind.

23:52.014 --> 23:54.766
He really cares for you.

23:54.850 --> 23:56.768
Think where you'd be without him.

23:56.852 --> 23:59.145
ln their clutches, on trial for murder.

24:00.981 --> 24:03.525
Yes. l'm very lucky.

24:03.609 --> 24:05.110
He feels responsible for you.

24:05.194 --> 24:07.904
-Oh, l know he does. l'm so grateful.
-Why?

24:08.864 --> 24:11.199
Why does he feel responsible for you?

24:12.868 --> 24:15.954
Well, l'm half Tully.
He loved your family so much.

24:16.038 --> 24:17.122
-Loved your mother.
-No.

24:17.206 --> 24:18.748
That's what you wanted to say.

24:18.833 --> 24:22.794
-He loves you, Aunt Lysa. He's married to you.
-Your mother never loved him.

24:22.878 --> 24:25.547
Cat always went straight for
the sweetest thing.

24:25.631 --> 24:28.633
The most obvious thing. Your Uncle Brandon.

24:28.717 --> 24:31.970
Your handsome, arrogant,
cruel Uncle Brandon.

24:32.054 --> 24:34.180
He almost killed Petyr in a duel.

24:34.265 --> 24:36.432
And your mother loved him anyway.

24:36.517 --> 24:40.311
And now Petyr is risking his life to save you,

24:40.396 --> 24:42.814
the daughter of a woman who didn't love him.

24:42.898 --> 24:46.067
No more than those whores in his brothels.

24:46.152 --> 24:48.820
-Has he told you about them?
-No.

24:48.904 --> 24:51.656
He hasn't told you about
the vile things they do with their bodies,

24:51.740 --> 24:54.033
they let him do with their bodies?

24:54.118 --> 24:55.869
-Never.
-Are you pregnant?

24:57.538 --> 25:00.540
What? No, l told you.
Lord Tyrion and l never...

25:00.624 --> 25:02.458
l wasn't asking about Tyrion.

25:02.585 --> 25:04.419
What have you let Petyr do with your body?

25:04.503 --> 25:07.172
-Aunt Lysa, no, l...
-Your young, pretty body.

25:07.256 --> 25:10.091
-Nothing. l'm a virgin.
-Don't lie to me.

25:10.176 --> 25:11.426
You're hurting me.

25:13.220 --> 25:14.762
l'll know if you lie.

25:15.598 --> 25:17.348
l'm a virgin, l swear it.

25:17.433 --> 25:19.225
He loves you, Aunt Lysa.

25:19.310 --> 25:21.186
All he says is that l'm stupid.

25:21.270 --> 25:24.355
l'm a stupid little girl with stupid dreams
who never learns,

25:24.440 --> 25:26.566
and l'm a terrible liar,
so l should always tell the truth.

25:26.650 --> 25:28.943
And l swear to you that
he has never touched me.

25:29.028 --> 25:31.279

25:36.994 --> 25:38.494
You'll be a widow soon.

25:38.579 --> 25:40.914
They'll execute that dwarf
for murdering the king

25:40.998 --> 25:43.041

26:15.783 --> 26:17.659
There wasn't much call for it
with Lord Tyrion, though.

26:18.786 --> 26:20.328
He preferred litters.

26:20.412 --> 26:22.914
Perhaps you should have stayed with him.

lt's not going to be
a pleasant journey for you.

l've made it this far in the world
without a squire.
