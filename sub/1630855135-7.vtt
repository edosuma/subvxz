00:04.421 --> 00:05.506
TONNY: I'm waiting
for Otto Frank.

00:05.506 --> 00:06.632
MIEP: He's not here.

00:06.632 --> 00:08.133
JOHANNES: We have
to be more careful.

00:08.133 --> 00:09.384
VICTOR: How much
more careful can we be?

00:09.384 --> 00:10.802
We have to feed people!

00:10.802 --> 00:12.346
MIEP: I told you once and
I'm not telling you again.

00:12.346 --> 00:13.764
I don't know
where Mr. Frank is.

00:13.764 --> 00:14.932
OTTO: He's trying to scare you.

00:14.932 --> 00:16.350
MIEP: He's a Dutch Nazi,
what, so you have a

00:16.350 --> 00:17.726
partnership with a Nazi?

00:17.726 --> 00:19.269
JAN: We're not doing enough.

00:19.269 --> 00:21.730
BRAM: There are a number of
us here who disagree with the

00:21.730 --> 00:24.233
policies of the occupiers.

00:24.233 --> 00:25.526
We'd like you to join us.

00:25.526 --> 00:26.443
JAN: Yes.

00:26.443 --> 00:27.903
I'm doing what you're doing.

00:27.903 --> 00:29.404
You said yes to Mr. Frank.

00:29.404 --> 00:30.614
I said yes, too.

00:30.614 --> 00:32.950
AUGUSTE: We blow up the
Civil Registry Office.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.952
OTTO: The Allies
have landed in France.

00:34.952 --> 00:37.287
FRITZ: It's just as the
Queen said would happen.

00:37.287 --> 00:39.331
We're going to be liberated!

00:39.665 --> 00:42.000
EDITH: I have this
bad feeling, Miep.

00:42.000 --> 00:44.044
I can't shake it.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.964
I have this dark hole in my
stomach that tells me this war

00:46.964 --> 00:48.006
will never end.

00:48.006 --> 00:49.091

00:49.091 --> 00:51.426

01:37.556 --> 01:39.057
JOHANNES: Shh.

01:39.057 --> 01:42.644
NELS: Remember, mother had
stomach pains before she died.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.855
JOHANNES: It's fine.
This isn't that.

01:44.855 --> 01:46.982
NELS: How do you know if
won't go to the doctor?

01:46.982 --> 01:48.483
JOHANNES: Can I think, please?

01:48.483 --> 01:50.652
NELS: And how can you expect
it to get any better if you

01:50.652 --> 01:52.571
don't seek medical help?

01:52.571 --> 01:54.781
JOHANNES: I'll go to the
doctor and he'll say stress.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.450
NELS: And he'd be right.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.368
I don't know how
you can keep this up.

01:58.368 --> 02:00.537
You and your "friends."

02:00.537 --> 02:03.123
JOHANNES: Well,
tell me how I stop.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.000
NELS: Just get it checked.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.085
JOHANNES: Uh-huh.

02:07.085 --> 02:08.587
Are any of these correct?

02:08.587 --> 02:10.964
Oh, good lord.
I'm gonna be late.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.007
NELS: You lose.

02:12.007 --> 02:13.342
Remember what
mother always said?

02:13.342 --> 02:14.593
"You leave a game unfinished."

02:14.593 --> 02:15.844
JOHANNES: I'm not forfeiting.

02:15.844 --> 02:17.095
I will be back at lunch.

Yeah.

At noon?

03:55.735 --> 03:57.362
Okay. I'll tell her.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.197
Bye-bye.

Miep she's having lunch

reminder to give a reminder?

04:04.870 --> 04:06.788
JOHANNES: Leave Bep alone.

04:06.788 --> 04:09.458
She's nabbed some extra milk
for our friends this morning.

04:09.458 --> 04:13.170
BEP: I almost had a heart
attack, but, yes, I did.

04:14.296 --> 04:15.630
JOHANNES: What's in the bag?

04:15.630 --> 04:17.299
VICTOR: My lunch.

04:17.299 --> 04:18.508
JOHANNES: Hmm.

04:18.508 --> 04:21.052
VICTOR: Laurie said
she'd left a surprise.

04:25.015 --> 04:28.351
JOHANNES: My God.
BEP: Where did she get that?

04:28.351 --> 04:31.521
VICTOR: Her cousin managed
to get some almond flour.

04:31.521 --> 04:34.441
I guess she used it.

04:35.192 --> 04:38.236
This is mine.
Do you understand?

04:38.236 --> 04:40.614
I'm putting it in the ice box.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.991
But it is mine.

04:42.991 --> 04:46.828
Tell Miep, especially Miep,
keep her hands off.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.289

reminder to remind Miep not to

MIEP: Mr. Kugler?

05:01.593 --> 05:03.053
Really?

05:03.053 --> 05:04.387
There are about a dozen words
I'd use to describe him

05:04.387 --> 05:06.806
before "funny."

05:08.308 --> 05:10.810
Oh, how did you
get down there?

05:10.810 --> 05:12.312
Oh, God.

Anyone else back here?

05:41.049 --> 05:43.969
JOHANNES: Yes.

05:46.137 --> 05:49.015
Mr. Kugler, the office manager,
through there.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.059

05:51.059 --> 05:53.728
Don't talk!

what, what's going on?

05:59.025 --> 06:01.486

06:02.362 --> 06:04.072
MIEP: What do we do?

06:04.072 --> 06:05.740
BEP: He said don't talk.

06:05.740 --> 06:07.200
JOHANNES: Do they know?

06:07.200 --> 06:09.911
Or is it just a hunt?

06:10.829 --> 06:13.039
KARL: We will keep looking.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.211
MIEP: We can't just sit here.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.588
BEP: He said stay.

06:19.588 --> 06:20.922
MIEP: No, we
have to warn them.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.507
I have to tell them
to hide or something.

06:22.507 --> 06:23.508
JOHANNES: Miep.

06:23.508 --> 06:24.718
KARL: Let's go then, shall we?

06:24.718 --> 06:27.512
JOHANNES: You'll lead
them right to them.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.938
VICTOR: I don't know what you
heard, but I don't know of any

06:36.938 --> 06:38.398
Jews hiding here.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.900
KARL: Stop playing with me!

06:39.900 --> 06:41.026
Are you in charge here?

06:41.026 --> 06:42.068
VICTOR: I am, I am!

06:42.068 --> 06:43.320
MIEP: What do we do?
What do we do?

06:43.320 --> 06:44.904
JOHANNES: Nothing.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.824
KARL: We know that you
are hiding Jews here.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.702
So, there is no use
to keep pretending.

06:50.702 --> 06:51.828
GRINGHUIS: There's a kitchen,

06:51.828 --> 06:54.331
but every other door
there is locked.

06:54.331 --> 06:56.249
KARL: Keys.
Where are the keys?

06:56.249 --> 06:58.084
JOHANNES: Uh, I don't know.
Uh, Miep?

06:58.084 --> 06:59.127
MIEP: I don't have them.

06:59.127 --> 07:00.003
VICTOR: She
doesn't have the keys.

07:00.003 --> 07:01.212
KARL: Stop playing with me.

07:04.507 --> 07:08.762
KARL: It is, um, stupid to
pretend this isn't happening.

07:08.762 --> 07:12.223
If you cooperate, things
will go better for you.

07:12.223 --> 07:14.434
I promise you that.

07:21.983 --> 07:26.112
Tell us where they are
and you will be all right.

07:27.238 --> 07:31.284
MIEP: There are no Jews here.

07:32.702 --> 07:35.163
KARL: No?

07:37.248 --> 07:40.085
GRINGHUIS: I found
some keys in the office.

07:40.085 --> 07:42.379
Is it these?

07:42.879 --> 07:45.757
KARL: They're not going to tell
me where the Jews are hiding.

07:47.634 --> 07:48.843
Fine.

07:48.843 --> 07:49.886
You.

07:49.886 --> 07:52.514
Show me the rooms in the back.

07:57.102 --> 07:59.396
GROOTENDORST: Stay in here.

this to my wife.

08:41.146 --> 08:42.564
Tell her what's happened.

08:42.564 --> 08:45.275

Hide yourself.

Go. Just go!
