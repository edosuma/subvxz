WEBVTT

00:12.930 --> 00:14.557
Is it really that bad?

00:16.725 --> 00:17.726
Yes.

00:18.561 --> 00:20.563
I can't wear that.

00:20.646 --> 00:22.565
Do you know how many photos
they take at weddings?

00:22.648 --> 00:25.233
But, as maid of honor, it's your job
to do everything your mom wants.

00:25.317 --> 00:28.571
Yeah, but if I believed that,
there'd be none of this...

00:30.614 --> 00:31.699
or this...

00:31.782 --> 00:32.991
- Zoë?
- Yes, Goldi?

00:33.784 --> 00:37.705
-Do you have the play budget?
-Uh, right here.

00:37.788 --> 00:42.876
Uh, Rasha was just helping me...
massage it.

00:42.960 --> 00:44.336
Thanks.

00:44.419 --> 00:46.379
- Nice dress.

00:49.592 --> 00:51.760
I can't believe
we nearly got caught again.

00:51.844 --> 00:54.888
- We are so bad at keeping secrets.

00:54.972 --> 00:58.100
You know, Goldi might be okay with us.

00:58.183 --> 01:00.268
But if she isn't
and she tells her parents,

01:00.352 --> 01:02.520
-they might kick me out.
-You're right.

01:02.605 --> 01:05.190
I just can't believe how cool
my mom's been about it.

01:05.774 --> 01:09.111
I mean, she didn't even mention the kiss.

01:09.194 --> 01:11.196
And she didn't even flinch
when I mentioned my girlfriend.

01:11.279 --> 01:14.241
You have a girlfriend?
Should I be jealous?

01:14.324 --> 01:17.452
--Uh, are we not there yet?

01:18.161 --> 01:21.999
Depends. Does your girlfriend
get an invite to your mom's wedding?

01:25.460 --> 01:27.921
- Yes. You can come.

01:29.089 --> 01:32.092
If I'm wearing that dress,
my mom owes me big.

01:33.010 --> 01:36.013
On second thought, I'm not sure
I want to be seen with you in that.

01:38.390 --> 01:43.353
♪ Whatever it takes
I know I can make it through ♪

01:44.772 --> 01:49.442
♪ And if I hold out
I know I can make it through ♪

01:53.697 --> 01:58.744
♪ Be the best, be the best
The best that I can be ♪

01:58.827 --> 02:00.537
♪ Whatever it takes ♪

02:01.454 --> 02:05.125
♪ I know I can make it
I know I can make it through ♪

02:09.504 --> 02:12.716
It's Friday night.
Lola's got the play. Shay's got Tiny.

02:12.800 --> 02:16.053
How do you want to kick off the weekend,
bro? I'm thinking Yogalates.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.472
The only thing I plan on stretching
is my hand in a chip bowl.

02:19.556 --> 02:22.768
Uh, besides, don't you have a boyfriend?
Oh, that's right. You guys broke up.

02:22.851 --> 02:25.979
Uh, no, we did not. We're on a break.
For two more weeks.

02:26.063 --> 02:27.898
- A what?
- A break.

02:27.981 --> 02:31.276
It's when two people take some time
and space to figure out what they want.

02:31.860 --> 02:33.862
I think me and Yael might be on a break.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.865
Um, what happens
if the other person realizes

02:36.949 --> 02:39.201
that what they want is just more space?

02:39.284 --> 02:41.494
Well, everyone says that
distance makes the heart grow fonder.

02:41.578 --> 02:43.330
Okay, so what if
you see them in the hallway?

02:43.413 --> 02:44.998
Are you just supposed
to pretend they don't exist?

02:45.082 --> 02:47.918
I don't know.
I guess you just... play it cool.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.002
Hey, Frankie.

02:53.006 --> 02:55.008
Hey, Jonah.

02:55.092 --> 02:58.971
Fancy seeing you here,
in the school we both attend.

02:59.054 --> 03:01.431
This has been great.
It's been great.

03:01.514 --> 03:04.309
But Hunter and I actually have
a family engagement we need to get to.

03:04.392 --> 03:05.853
Right, Hunter? Let's go.

03:06.478 --> 03:08.939
--So that was cool.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.232
How do you think he seemed?

03:10.315 --> 03:12.400
The way he always does.
Vaguely aloof and withholding.

03:12.484 --> 03:14.403
Do you think
he wants the break to be over?

03:14.486 --> 03:17.364
Don't ask me. I just figured out
what a break was two seconds ago.

03:17.447 --> 03:20.575
Besides, shouldn't you
be figuring out what you want?

03:22.745 --> 03:25.831
One minute, I was on the bench.
The next, I was in traffic.

03:25.914 --> 03:28.959
-Do you think it was a hallucination?
-Hard to say.

03:29.042 --> 03:32.670
Well, the Internet says hallucinations
can be symptoms of a brain tumor.

03:32.755 --> 03:36.049
That would explain
the changes in my personality, right?

03:36.133 --> 03:37.675
It could.

03:37.760 --> 03:40.012
So what's next?
CAT scan? MRI?

03:40.095 --> 03:42.180
I may have spent all night on WebMD.

03:43.098 --> 03:44.266
Sit down, Maya.

03:46.769 --> 03:49.479
Now,
your weight's dropped quite a bit.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.899
-What's your appetite been like?
-Not great.

03:51.982 --> 03:53.275
Have you been tired?

03:53.358 --> 03:55.235
Just rip the Band-Aid off, Doc.
Is it cancer?

03:55.318 --> 03:57.112
Maya, I think you're depressed.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.158
No.

04:01.241 --> 04:05.078
This isn't like last time.
I don't just feel anxious and sad.

04:05.162 --> 04:07.080
Depression's a disease
that can take many forms.

04:07.164 --> 04:09.707
And, like cancer,
it needs intense treatment to fix.

04:09.792 --> 04:11.334
Okay, so there's a magic pill I can take?

04:11.418 --> 04:14.546
We may try medication, but I would also
recommend lots of therapy.

04:14.629 --> 04:16.589
But I already did that and it didn't work.

04:16.673 --> 04:18.508
You guys said it was over, and it's not.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.677
Depression's a life-long battle.

04:20.761 --> 04:21.887
But look at the bright side.

04:21.970 --> 04:23.847
Now that we know what's wrong,
we can fix it.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.435
Okay, we've picked up your dress
and your shoes.

04:28.518 --> 04:32.064
Oh, and I have to, uh,
confirm the AV equipment.

04:32.147 --> 04:33.606
You told your friends
no heavy metal, right?

04:33.690 --> 04:37.735
Grace and Jonah
are taking this DJ job very seriously.

04:37.820 --> 04:40.572
-And thanks for letting them do it.
-Of course.

04:40.655 --> 04:42.365
It's not my wedding.
It's ours.

04:42.449 --> 04:45.118
--You, Phil, and I are becoming a family.

04:46.578 --> 04:49.289
Does that mean
I can pick our bridesmaid dress?

04:49.372 --> 04:52.667
Sometimes
we make sacrifices for the people we love.

04:55.128 --> 04:59.800
Like allowing them to add
a last-minute plus-one to the guest list?

05:00.383 --> 05:03.261
Oh, hon, you know how
the venue is about capacity.

05:03.345 --> 05:06.306
- But Rasha really wants to come.
- No.

05:07.515 --> 05:09.767
So it's not really our wedding.

05:09.852 --> 05:13.313
Honey, you don't wanna out yourself
in front of the relatives.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.732
Because it might
ruffle some feathers?

05:15.816 --> 05:17.609
No, 'cause you're not gay.

05:18.568 --> 05:21.822
Come on, look at you.
Look at your hair. The way you dress.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.991
You're just confused.

05:26.576 --> 05:28.829
You saw me kiss Rasha, right?

05:28.912 --> 05:32.165
And I've seen you also kiss a lot of boys.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.002
Sweets, don't worry.

05:35.085 --> 05:37.754
Someday, you will meet Mr. Right,
and you will...

05:37.837 --> 05:41.967
You'll forget
all about this little phase, okay?

05:43.176 --> 05:44.594
What's next on the list?

05:44.677 --> 05:46.221
Oh, yeah! The cake.

05:46.304 --> 05:50.183
And, uh, after, I need to go to the tailor
to pick up Phil's suit.

05:50.267 --> 05:52.560
I know what you're thinking.
I'm not supposed to see the suit...

05:58.901 --> 06:02.070
Yael says I need to earn back her trust,
but she won't tell me how.

06:02.154 --> 06:03.655
What am I supposed to do, read her mind?

06:03.738 --> 06:05.490
You should read this book.

06:05.573 --> 06:07.825
I'm finding it very illuminating.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.327
Break-Up or Breakthrough?

06:10.996 --> 06:13.748
It's actually explaining why we have
problems with our relationships.

06:13.831 --> 06:14.874
Dad.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.793
Mmm. A father we barely see.

06:16.876 --> 06:20.588
It suggests we use
the CAT technique to build trust.

06:21.298 --> 06:22.674
We could try it on Yael.

06:22.757 --> 06:25.468
But, first, you'd need to tell me
why you two are having trouble.

06:28.305 --> 06:31.933
On second thought,
what has anyone ever learned from a book?

06:47.240 --> 06:49.701
Okay, CAT technique.

06:49.784 --> 06:52.204
C. Start with a compliment.

06:52.287 --> 06:53.913
You look pretty today.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.834
"You look pretty today."

07:06.426 --> 07:10.263
Oh, okay. No wonder you wanted
to keep that on the DL, brother.

07:11.681 --> 07:15.852
Okay, A.
Apologize and accept responsibility.

07:15.936 --> 07:19.314
"I'm sorry.
That must've been hard."

07:19.397 --> 07:22.692
Mmm, no, not "hard."

07:23.693 --> 07:25.153
"Confusing."

07:31.659 --> 07:33.703
"Because I love you."

07:38.291 --> 07:39.376
"Yes."

07:44.797 --> 07:47.800
Okay.
Describe one event that upset you today.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.262
The moment you opened this book.

07:50.345 --> 07:51.929
Very funny.

07:52.014 --> 07:55.767
Look, Dr. Narello said these exercises
would help you understand your feelings.

07:55.850 --> 07:57.894
I feel like
this book is a waste of time.

07:57.978 --> 07:59.021
I'm not depressed.

07:59.104 --> 08:01.814
-I know it's hard to accept.
-Because it's not true.

08:01.898 --> 08:04.234
Why are you siding
with that stupid doctor?

08:04.317 --> 08:06.361
Because I just want to fix you.

08:06.444 --> 08:07.445
Well, I'm not broken.

08:07.529 --> 08:09.531
That's not what I said.
Don't be ridiculous.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.574
Oh, so now I'm ridiculous?

08:11.658 --> 08:12.993
You just don't like
the way I am right now,

08:13.076 --> 08:15.203
so you want some stupid disease
to blame it on.

08:15.287 --> 08:17.830
Honey, please. The book says
you can't trust your thoughts.

08:17.914 --> 08:20.417
-You have to see--
-Oh, so now my thoughts are wrong, too?

08:20.500 --> 08:21.668
Let's do this later.
I don't want to fight.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.586
No, you're the one that started it!

08:23.670 --> 08:25.547
Admit it.
You hate me.

08:25.630 --> 08:28.425
That's not you talking, it's the disease!
The book says you--

08:28.508 --> 08:30.343
Oh, stop talking about
the stupid book, Mom.

08:30.427 --> 08:32.095
-I hate it! And I hate you!
-Maya!

08:38.560 --> 08:41.438
That mirror was my grandmother's.

08:43.731 --> 08:45.358
Whatever.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.110
I always thought it was ugly.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.177
I don't...
I just don't know what to do anymore.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.595
She's like a different person.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.764
I mean, how did I let it get this bad?

09:58.723 --> 10:00.267
I feel like I've failed as a parent.

10:00.350 --> 10:02.852
No, it's okay, Mom.

10:02.935 --> 10:04.271
I'm here now.
We'll sort it out.

10:07.774 --> 10:08.775
Maya?

10:11.444 --> 10:12.612
Hey, munchkin.

10:13.655 --> 10:15.198
What are you doing here?

10:15.282 --> 10:17.409
Don't you have soccer practice?
And finals?

10:17.492 --> 10:20.120
Yeah, but what's
more important than family time?

10:23.123 --> 10:25.041
-You didn't have to ruin her life, too.
-Maya!

10:25.125 --> 10:26.918
Okay. Let's just...

10:27.001 --> 10:28.962
Why don't we hang out today?
We can catch up.

10:29.045 --> 10:30.839
I can't.
I have to take care of something.

10:30.922 --> 10:32.799
-All right. Well, I can come with you.
-Maybe next time.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.028
Hi, uh, have you seen Zoë?

11:04.080 --> 11:06.499
Whoa!
You... you took a pass on the dress.

11:09.126 --> 11:11.546
I second-guessed my outfit
a kajillion times.

11:11.629 --> 11:14.674
I've never been out with a girlfriend.
I'm so nervous.

11:14.757 --> 11:15.925
Me, too.

11:20.388 --> 11:23.182
There's my mom.
Uh, we should go say hi.

11:24.934 --> 11:25.935
Yeah.

11:31.107 --> 11:34.569
Mom, this is my girlfriend, Rasha.

11:35.487 --> 11:38.030
Ms. Rivas, you look beautiful.
Everything's beautiful.

11:38.114 --> 11:40.074
Thank you so much for inviting me.

11:40.157 --> 11:42.369
You should find yourself a spot.
The ceremony is about to begin.

11:42.452 --> 11:44.161
Okay.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.128
Go ahead.
Say something.

11:52.879 --> 11:55.214
Do you have the bouquet?
It's almost time.

11:55.298 --> 11:57.800
-Yes. Uh, I'll go get it.
-Okay.

12:06.601 --> 12:07.977
Have you seen Hunter?

12:08.060 --> 12:11.188
I'm wondering how things are going
between him and Yael.

12:11.273 --> 12:12.274
Hmm?

12:12.357 --> 12:14.442
-What are you doing?
-Texting Jonah.

12:14.526 --> 12:17.028
"Hey, Jonah.
You look pretty.

12:17.111 --> 12:18.696
-I love you."
-Don't you dare!

12:18.780 --> 12:20.782
Because that would be
a huge violation of personal privacy.

12:20.865 --> 12:23.660
-I was just trying to help.
-By interfering with my relationship?

12:23.743 --> 12:25.828
Miles, some support?

12:25.912 --> 12:27.330
First, I need more info.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.624
Frankie pretended to be me online to Yael.

12:29.707 --> 12:30.708
And she forgave you.

12:30.792 --> 12:33.545
-Because you told her I loved her.
-Don't you?

12:33.628 --> 12:36.047
-Doesn't mean I was ready to say it.
-I'm good. Send the text.

12:36.130 --> 12:37.715
No! Okay, wait.

12:38.341 --> 12:41.135
I thought that maybe if I could
fix things between you and Yael,

12:41.219 --> 12:42.845
- maybe there'd be hope for me and Jonah.

12:44.556 --> 12:46.558
That is really pathetic.

12:47.434 --> 12:48.893
And it's too late.

12:48.976 --> 12:50.144
What?

12:51.604 --> 12:52.772
Jonah's gonna see this!

12:52.855 --> 12:55.358
-He's gonna think I'm a crazy person.
-Probably.

12:55.442 --> 12:58.110
I need to explain what happened.

12:58.194 --> 13:00.905
- Well, he's at the Rivas wedding.
- Then that's where I'll go!

13:00.988 --> 13:02.198
Good plan.

13:06.077 --> 13:07.787
And I, Consuela Rivas,

13:07.870 --> 13:11.916
take this man, Phillip Hawthorne,
to be my husband.

13:18.340 --> 13:21.468
"Love is patient.
Love is kind.

13:21.551 --> 13:24.346
It does not envy.
It does not boast.

13:24.429 --> 13:27.181
It is not proud.
It does not..."

13:47.284 --> 13:48.995
That's a lot of money.
You going on a trip?

13:49.078 --> 13:50.580
Yeah. Something like that.

13:51.623 --> 13:54.667
Um, take care of Zig for me, okay?

13:54.751 --> 13:56.544
Um, okay.

14:06.303 --> 14:09.766
"Love does not delight in evil,
but rejoices with the truth.

14:09.849 --> 14:16.355
It always protects, always trusts,
always hopes, always perseveres."

14:25.031 --> 14:26.741
You seem to have a visitor.

14:27.450 --> 14:28.576
Frankie?

14:32.580 --> 14:35.875
-Have you checked your DMs recently?
-No. Not since before the ceremony.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.377
Good, 'cause I need to delete something.

14:40.422 --> 14:42.424
-You think I'm pretty?
-That was Hunter.

14:42.507 --> 14:44.341
Oh, good.
So, Hunter thinks I'm pretty.

14:44.426 --> 14:46.469
Yeah, I always kinda thought
we had a special connection.

14:46.553 --> 14:48.304
-Okay. I'm gonna go.
-Frankie?

14:50.097 --> 14:53.100
What about the other thing?
Was that Hunter, too?

14:54.351 --> 14:56.062
You mean the "I love you"?

14:59.607 --> 15:02.735
He wrote it.
But... I feel it.

15:03.653 --> 15:06.489
And... I know you don't feel the same way.

15:06.573 --> 15:10.201
-Those words have never been easy for me.
-Because you're afraid to commit.

15:10.284 --> 15:11.661
And I need constant validation,

15:11.744 --> 15:13.830
which is probably why
I tend to overthink things.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.333
Even though we're a toxic couple...

15:17.417 --> 15:20.377
I really miss you
and I want our break to be over.

15:20.462 --> 15:21.463
It's go time.

15:22.797 --> 15:23.798
Call you later?

15:32.098 --> 15:33.766
Do I smell popcorn?

15:33.850 --> 15:36.018
With extra butter, and there's also soda

15:36.102 --> 15:38.605
and every type of candy
known to womankind.

15:38.688 --> 15:40.189
I thought we could have a movie night.

15:40.272 --> 15:42.108
-Wizard of Oz?
-Obvi.

15:42.817 --> 15:44.486
Do I make the guest list?

15:44.569 --> 15:46.571
You'll have to change first.

15:46.654 --> 15:48.906
- Yeah. No mom jeans allowed.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.492
PJs, everyone.

15:50.575 --> 15:52.785
- I got matching ones.

15:56.748 --> 15:59.041
Um, I fixed the mirror. Or...

15:59.125 --> 16:01.335
at least, I tried.

16:01.418 --> 16:03.170
It looks perfect.

16:04.171 --> 16:05.840
I'm sorry I've been such a burden lately.

16:05.923 --> 16:07.133
-No.
-No, you haven't.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.010
Don't lie.

16:10.762 --> 16:13.014
I know things have been hard.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.558
But I'm gonna make it all better.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.018
I have a plan.

16:17.894 --> 16:20.021
- Can't wait to hear it.

16:20.104 --> 16:23.357
Okay, PJs, everyone.
Let's get this party started.

16:27.695 --> 16:30.114
May I have this dance?

16:34.410 --> 16:37.664
So, what's with the new look, hmm?

16:37.747 --> 16:39.331
You don't like it?

16:39.415 --> 16:41.709
I do, but is it really you?

16:42.835 --> 16:46.130
I'm sick of everyone second-guessing
whether I'm gay because of my look.

16:46.213 --> 16:49.050
-Do you like kissing me?
-Yes.

16:49.133 --> 16:51.678
- Then you're pretty darn gay.

16:52.929 --> 16:54.889
I'm so glad you're here.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.565
Zoë, what are you doing?

17:03.648 --> 17:05.692
Dancing with my girlfriend.

17:05.775 --> 17:06.984
Stop it.

17:08.945 --> 17:10.530
Now, before everyone sees.

17:12.281 --> 17:13.741
No.

17:13.825 --> 17:16.327
I'm not gonna pretend
to be someone I'm not.

17:16.410 --> 17:18.788
Not for you.
Not for anyone.

17:19.997 --> 17:21.749
Don't you dare turn this around on me!

17:21.833 --> 17:23.751
I have done everything for you.

17:23.835 --> 17:26.588
Except love me for who I am.

17:26.671 --> 17:29.173
I love you despite who you are.

17:29.256 --> 17:32.301
And then you bring this girl
to my wedding after I said no?

17:32.384 --> 17:35.221
You are so selfish! God!

17:35.304 --> 17:38.307
You're the one who can't get over her
stupid prejudices for her own daughter!

17:38.390 --> 17:40.059
Okay. Okay.
Okay, Consuela, I got this.

17:40.142 --> 17:42.519
Come on, just relax, okay?
It's okay.

17:42.604 --> 17:44.271
Zoë, I think you should leave, okay?

17:46.065 --> 17:48.610
You heard him.
Just... leave.

17:50.111 --> 17:52.238
Gladly.
Come on, Rasha.

17:54.240 --> 17:55.241
It's okay.

17:57.744 --> 18:01.038
Can you believe she called me selfish?
As if I was in the wrong!

18:04.709 --> 18:05.334
What?

18:05.417 --> 18:07.503
You said I was welcome at the wedding.

18:07.587 --> 18:08.796
Well, I wanted you there.

18:08.880 --> 18:11.548
-But not your mom. Not your family.
-What does that matter?

18:12.341 --> 18:15.261
Two years ago,
I was invited to my aunt's for a party.

18:15.344 --> 18:18.430
The police arrived to question me.
She had reported me for being gay.

18:18.514 --> 18:20.600
-This is not the same thing.
-Really?

18:20.683 --> 18:24.020
You put me in a situation
where people hated me for being who I am.

18:24.103 --> 18:27.815
Look, I'm not the bad guy here.
We can get past this.

18:28.774 --> 18:31.235
- I don't trust you.

18:45.499 --> 18:47.251
Can you call my phone
to check if it's working?

18:47.334 --> 18:50.004
Has that ever, in the history of time,
been a problem?

19:03.517 --> 19:04.518
Hey.

19:05.937 --> 19:07.146
Uh, your mom let me in.

19:08.272 --> 19:11.067
-You brought me flowers?
-Uh, yeah.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.152
It was one of the centerpieces.
I thought you'd like it.

19:13.235 --> 19:14.987
- I do.

19:15.071 --> 19:17.990
Here. What are you looking at?
You seem pretty into it.

19:23.120 --> 19:25.081
Is that my inbox?

19:25.665 --> 19:28.209
-Um...
-How did you get my passwords?

19:28.292 --> 19:29.669
-I...
-You know what?

19:29.752 --> 19:31.545
Never mind.
I... I don't care.

19:31.628 --> 19:34.131
Okay, I'm... I'm sorry.

19:34.215 --> 19:37.760
When you didn't call, I... I didn't know
what you were thinking. So...

19:37.844 --> 19:39.679
technically, I did it for us?

19:39.762 --> 19:42.264
All year,
you've second-guessed my feelings for you

19:42.348 --> 19:44.100
and I liked you enough to give it a pass.

19:45.184 --> 19:47.061
Can you give me one more chance?

19:47.144 --> 19:49.188
I mean, that was...
that was why I came here.

19:49.271 --> 19:52.108
But this is a huge violation of my trust.

19:52.191 --> 19:53.901
I... I'm done.

19:57.571 --> 20:00.908
And just to be clear, this is a breakup.
Not a break.

20:03.369 --> 20:06.288
Wait!
Jonah, no. Please.

20:06.372 --> 20:07.623
Can we talk about this?

20:09.166 --> 20:12.378
Well, I'd love to, but I have to go home
and change my passwords.

20:37.028 --> 20:38.487
You think she'll ever forgive me?

20:39.405 --> 20:40.406
Your mom?

20:41.407 --> 20:42.574
Rasha.

20:43.951 --> 20:47.204
It was stupid to bring her to the wedding
after my mom said no.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.958
I thought if she saw us together...

20:51.042 --> 20:53.044
she'd be able to finally accept me.

20:54.796 --> 20:57.714
-I never wanted to hurt anyone.
-I know, dude.

20:59.466 --> 21:01.803
Now I have nothing.

21:03.304 --> 21:04.931
No one.

21:05.014 --> 21:06.557
--So, now I'm nobody?

21:10.853 --> 21:12.271
I spoke to my mom.

21:12.354 --> 21:14.315
You can stay with us
for as long as you want.

21:16.984 --> 21:19.779
--Come on. Let's go home.

21:27.078 --> 21:31.791
"Oh, Auntie Em,
there's no place like home!"

21:31.874 --> 21:33.876
I can't believe
you still remember every word.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.211
Of course.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.088
I'm gonna hit the sack.

21:37.171 --> 21:39.090
Mmm. I should get clean sheets.

21:39.173 --> 21:41.801
Or Katie could sleep in my room,
like old times.

21:41.884 --> 21:44.428
Oh, okay, if you insist.

21:44.511 --> 21:47.181
But you'd better
keep those ice cubes to yourself.

21:47.264 --> 21:49.266
--Deal.

21:49.350 --> 21:51.602
But, first, I must floss.

21:55.606 --> 21:57.024
I'm so tired.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.184
--Pee emergency.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.689
We need more than one bathroom
in this place.

22:40.109 --> 22:42.861
-You okay?
-Yeah.

22:42.945 --> 22:46.032
I'm just happy you're here.
Make everything easier on Mom.

22:49.285 --> 22:50.827
Hey, I love you, too, sis.
