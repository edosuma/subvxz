00:45.587 --> 00:47.256
-This is...
-Yeah.

00:47.339 --> 00:50.384
-Whoa.
-Pretty much.

00:54.763 --> 00:57.849
[chuckles]
This is your home?

00:57.933 --> 01:01.937
Trollmarket is home and hearth
and sanctuary for all good trolls.

01:02.020 --> 01:04.188
This way, my friends.
There is much to see.

01:04.272 --> 01:08.944
Dang! And here I thought the only thing
underneath our town was dirt and plumbing.

01:12.364 --> 01:16.785
Stay close. Human feet have never graced
the ground of Trollmarket before.

01:16.868 --> 01:19.997
-Human?
-Friends.

01:22.040 --> 01:25.627
This is crazy!
Are you getting this, Tobes?

01:25.711 --> 01:27.004
Oh, yeah. On it.

01:31.883 --> 01:33.302
-Hi!
-[groans]

01:40.267 --> 01:47.274
Check it out! Peridot, Topaz, Cassiterite!
[gasps] Kornerupine!

01:47.357 --> 01:48.233
[growls]

01:48.984 --> 01:50.068
Hi.

01:56.033 --> 01:59.202
Your knowledge of minerals
is almost troll-like, Tobias.

01:59.286 --> 02:02.205
So, your kind, you all live here?

02:02.289 --> 02:06.543
Trolls travel from afar to our market
to find comfort and remedies.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.045
You'll find most anything you need
and sometimes you'll find

02:09.128 --> 02:10.589
what you never knew you needed.

02:10.672 --> 02:11.840
[growls]

02:15.886 --> 02:19.931
Oh, hey, little guy! That's a cute
pointy hat. And pointy teeth!

02:20.015 --> 02:23.310
Look out! Get away!
Get out of here! Vile vermin! Be gone!

02:23.435 --> 02:24.811
[growls]

02:26.146 --> 02:27.606
-What is that?
-Gnomes are vermin.

02:27.689 --> 02:31.026
Pickpockets, scum of the earth! We only
tolerate them for their grooming services.

02:31.109 --> 02:32.110
[Jim]
Grooming?

02:32.194 --> 02:34.363
[Blinky] They eat the parasites
on the larger trolls.

02:35.864 --> 02:38.784
-[gnomes scream]
-Jim! Jim! Check it out!

02:38.867 --> 02:40.869
Maximum coolosity there.

02:42.371 --> 02:44.206
Look at that. It's amazing!

02:45.165 --> 02:49.336
-[Aaarrrgghh] Heartstone.
-The life force of trollkind.

02:49.419 --> 02:52.339
The means that keeps us
from crumbling to stone

02:52.422 --> 02:55.092
and the source of light and sustenance.

02:55.175 --> 02:57.302
Okay, that's totally the bomb.

02:57.386 --> 02:59.388
What are humans doing here?

02:59.471 --> 03:00.972
-Fleshbag!
-Puny!

03:01.056 --> 03:05.268
-I think we've attracted the paparazzi.
-Friends, there is no need to be afraid.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.646
-He is the Trollhu--
-What is this?

03:07.729 --> 03:09.940
I was just getting to that, Draal.

03:10.023 --> 03:14.861
Human feet have never sullied
the ground of Trollmarket before.

03:14.945 --> 03:18.448
Who are these fleshbags?

03:18.532 --> 03:23.328
Believe it or not, he is, um...
How do I put this? Our new Trollhunter.

03:23.412 --> 03:26.039
[all gasp]

03:26.123 --> 03:29.209
He can't be the Trollhunter.
He's not a troll!

03:29.292 --> 03:31.336
-[yelps]
-Amulet chose.

03:31.420 --> 03:34.506
-[roars]
-Try to remain calm. Destiny is just--

03:34.589 --> 03:35.632
Show him, Jimbo!

03:37.259 --> 03:39.219
-For the power of Merlin--
-[Blinky] "Glory."

03:39.302 --> 03:44.516
Right, sorry. For the glory of Merlin,
Daylight is mine to command.

03:48.645 --> 03:49.688
Pretty cool, right?

03:49.771 --> 03:51.273
[gnomes whimper]

03:51.356 --> 03:53.734
A human? Protecting us?

03:54.526 --> 03:55.444
<i>Bushigal!</i>

03:55.527 --> 04:01.742
I am Draal, son of Kanjigar
and the amulet's rightful heir!

04:01.825 --> 04:05.203
Uh, you're his son? He's his son?

04:05.287 --> 04:07.956
[gasps] Yeah, I can see how
this could be a problem.

04:08.039 --> 04:11.918
When my father fell,
the honor should have passed to me.

04:14.004 --> 04:16.089
Amulet chose.

04:16.923 --> 04:20.093
We'll see what Vendel
has to say about this.

04:20.177 --> 04:24.097
Feel free to fetch him. In the meanwhile,
lots of Trollhunter business to be done.

04:24.181 --> 04:27.350
-Draal, wonderful to see you as always.
-[chuckles]

04:27.434 --> 04:28.602
[growls]

04:32.063 --> 04:35.108
Whoa! Wh-- Whoa!

04:36.610 --> 04:38.361
Um, what just happened?

04:38.445 --> 04:42.115
The amulet responded to your
unconscious command, Master Jim.

04:42.199 --> 04:45.160
-You are at ease, are you not?
-I am, actually.

04:45.243 --> 04:48.288
It senses that.
You are beginning to master it.

04:50.582 --> 04:56.046
Holy trolls! Is this a palace?

05:01.134 --> 05:04.471
[Blinky]
This is "The Hero's Forge."

05:09.142 --> 05:11.186
-Ooh...
-[laughs]

05:11.269 --> 05:13.855
-[screams] Don't do that again!
-Come on.

05:19.069 --> 05:22.155
<i>Magnifico!</i> Wait, are these...?

05:22.239 --> 05:24.157
[Aaarrrgghh]
Trollhunters.

05:24.241 --> 05:26.451
[Blinky]
Your predecessors, Master Jim.

05:26.535 --> 05:30.121
A line of heroism that reaches back
to the age of Merlin.

05:30.205 --> 05:34.501
This is the place of the final repose
for Kanjigar "the Courageous."

05:34.584 --> 05:38.213
One day, there will be a statue
of you here, Master Jim.

05:38.296 --> 05:40.715
One day very far off
in the future, of course.

05:40.799 --> 05:43.718
Yeah, about that, there's just
one thing I'm not getting.

05:43.802 --> 05:46.346
-Just one?
-You guys are trolls.

05:46.429 --> 05:50.433
So, "Trollhunter" sounds a little
like you hunt yourselves, you know?

05:50.517 --> 05:53.728
-Hunt bad trolls. Gumm-Gumms.
-[groans]

05:53.812 --> 05:56.147
Not exactly the most terrifying name.

05:56.231 --> 05:58.525
In Trollspeak, "Gumm-Gumm" means

05:58.608 --> 06:01.778
"bringer of horrible, slow, painful
and thoroughly-calculated death."

06:01.861 --> 06:04.239
-Oh.
-But do not be too concerned, Master Jim.

06:04.322 --> 06:07.033
The Gumm-Gumms were exiled
to the Darklands centuries ago.

06:07.117 --> 06:11.037
-Only one roams free.
-And wants to kill you.

06:11.121 --> 06:13.790
Wait, Bular is one
of the unspeakably evil trolls?

06:13.873 --> 06:17.252
Indeed. His father and the rest of their
number remain exiled to the Darklands,

06:17.335 --> 06:19.504
but they have been trying
to escape for centuries.

06:19.588 --> 06:21.298
I sense ill times are upon us.

06:21.381 --> 06:24.301
Hence the need for us to begin
Master Jim's training now.

06:24.384 --> 06:25.385
Step back, please.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.599
A little further, Tobias.

06:30.682 --> 06:31.558
Oh, very well.

06:34.269 --> 06:35.270
[both scream]

06:35.353 --> 06:38.648
-There's a big blade!
-Oh, no! [screams]

06:42.861 --> 06:44.529
-Excellent reflexes, Master Jim.
-[Toby screaming]

06:44.613 --> 06:49.284
Great, but maybe we could start off easy?
Like, you know, with less grindy things?

06:49.367 --> 06:52.245
[male voice]
Blinkous Galadrigal.

06:54.706 --> 06:57.709
Blinkous Galadrigal.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.378
-That's your name?
-Horrible, I know.

07:00.462 --> 07:05.467
I wish to meet the fleshbag
supposedly chosen by the amulet.

07:05.550 --> 07:11.097
I am Vendel,
son of Rundle, son of Kilfred.

07:11.181 --> 07:15.101
Uh... Toby, son of Ralph.
I live with my Nana.

07:15.185 --> 07:18.313
-Produce the amulet, Trollhunter.
-[gasps]

07:18.396 --> 07:20.065
Oh, no! My phone!

07:20.148 --> 07:23.026
I think I'm the fleshbag
that you're looking for. [chuckles]

07:23.109 --> 07:24.444
Amulet chose.

07:24.527 --> 07:28.365
Hmm... So Draal tells me. Ridiculous!

07:28.448 --> 07:32.744
However, the amulet has been known
to make ill-fated choices,

07:32.827 --> 07:35.664
as you know better than most.

07:36.456 --> 07:39.793
-What's that mean?
-Blinky trained Trollhunter before.

07:39.876 --> 07:42.087
Unkar "the Unfortunate."

07:42.170 --> 07:43.588
Why is he unfortunate?

07:43.672 --> 07:45.966
First night out, torn.

07:46.049 --> 07:47.509
Like, conflicted?

07:47.592 --> 07:50.679
No. Limb from limb.

07:51.721 --> 07:52.764
[yelps]

07:52.847 --> 07:56.851
If the amulet chose true,
the Soothscryer will reveal it.

07:56.935 --> 08:00.230
Please! Master Jim hasn't had
even an hour's training.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.856
Mm-mm!

08:04.109 --> 08:05.735
[chuckles nervously]

08:11.658 --> 08:12.534
[amulet dings]

08:19.374 --> 08:21.960
Behold, the Soothscryer!

08:22.043 --> 08:25.547
It will judge your true spirit.

08:25.630 --> 08:29.259
Insert your right hand, Trollhunter.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.845
Um, I'm going to get it back, right?

08:31.928 --> 08:34.222
That is part of the test.

08:34.304 --> 08:36.890
Oh, great. Tobes, Tobes!
Come here and help me.

08:36.975 --> 08:40.020
Okay, Jimbo, but I am not
sticking my hand in there.

08:40.102 --> 08:41.520
[both grunting]

08:48.695 --> 08:51.489
[screaming]

08:52.824 --> 08:55.410
[both screaming]

08:56.244 --> 08:59.706
-I'm okay! [sighs]
-Ooh, everything hurts. Well? What is it?

09:00.915 --> 09:03.501
Hmm... Inconclusive.

09:03.585 --> 09:06.087
Inconclusive? [scoffs]
Not doing that again.

09:06.171 --> 09:08.882
Wait, wait, wait.
What does "inconclusive" mean?

09:08.965 --> 09:13.720
It means, Trollhunter, that there's never
been a human to bear the mantle before.

09:13.803 --> 09:17.599
The Soothscryer needs more time
to render its judgment.

09:17.682 --> 09:22.353
Let us all hope
you live long enough to see.

09:24.522 --> 09:27.150
Oh, what have I gotten myself into?

09:27.233 --> 09:31.905
Um... trolls, cool underground city,
indigenous gemforms, Heartstone?

09:31.988 --> 09:36.076
What you've gotten yourself into
is total awesome-mania, man!

09:36.159 --> 09:37.452
If I survive.

09:37.535 --> 09:41.039
Come on! You're going to get trained
by the best. Blinky is--

09:41.122 --> 09:45.335
His last guy got torn limb from limb...
on his first night!

09:49.339 --> 09:53.259
So, there's nowhere to go but up.
Oh, no! Looks like your mom's home.

09:53.343 --> 09:57.764
Okay, quick, I was bike-jacked by three--
no, make it seven-- members of the Bratva.

09:57.847 --> 09:58.848
That's the Russian mob.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.851
And then, you broke into their hideout
to try to save me--

10:01.935 --> 10:05.897
Or I could tell her your bike got hit
by a car, but you're totally fine.

10:07.190 --> 10:09.901
-That works too, I guess.
-Night, Tobes.

10:13.738 --> 10:15.240
[dish clattering, water running]

10:15.323 --> 10:17.200
[Barbara]
Jim, I'm in the kitchen!

10:17.283 --> 10:18.701
Hey, Mom. Oh, man.

10:18.785 --> 10:22.413
You would so not believe
what happened on the way home from--

10:22.497 --> 10:23.873
Look who stopped by.

10:24.499 --> 10:27.544
-Hello, Jim.
-Mr. Strickler.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.130
Mr. Strickler came by to congratulate you.

10:30.213 --> 10:32.757
Oh, that's really... nice.

10:32.841 --> 10:36.845
It's a great honor that you've been
chosen to wield this mantle.

10:36.928 --> 10:39.722
I've no doubt that you'll prove
equal to the task.

10:39.806 --> 10:40.640
Of?

10:40.723 --> 10:43.852
Why didn't you tell me you were
trying out for <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> ?

10:43.935 --> 10:45.895
Maybe we could back up a few steps?

10:45.979 --> 10:49.440
Jim, surely you knew
you'd won the part of Romeo

10:49.524 --> 10:52.193
after your breathtaking audition
yesterday.

10:52.277 --> 10:55.780
Yeah, after the audition,
I had to run, but-- Wait, I got the part?

10:55.864 --> 10:57.657
I was just remarking to your mother

10:57.740 --> 11:00.827
that I'm a touch concerned
about your being spread so thin,

11:00.910 --> 11:04.247
particularly in light of your new
commitment to the chess club.

11:04.330 --> 11:07.584
And I didn't even think you knew
how to play chess. [laughs]

11:07.667 --> 11:11.963
Chess, acting... It's like you have this
entire secret life I know nothing about.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.798
You have no idea.

11:13.882 --> 11:16.718
Atlas, too, carried the weight
of the world on his shoulders,

11:16.801 --> 11:19.971
and I'm concerned, like him,
you're overextending yourself.

11:20.054 --> 11:21.014
I can handle it.

11:21.097 --> 11:24.350
A few days ago,
you were falling asleep in class.

11:24.434 --> 11:25.852
Wait, what? [gasps] Oh!

11:25.935 --> 11:30.982
Yeah, but-but-but now
I am recharged and ready to go.

11:31.065 --> 11:33.526
"To be or not to be." Right?

11:33.610 --> 11:36.779
[chuckles]
Right? Am I right?

11:36.863 --> 11:39.908
-Jim, that's <i>Hamlet.</i>
-[chuckles]

11:40.825 --> 11:45.371
Thanks. I don't want to overstay
my welcome. My phone, Mrs. Lake.

11:45.455 --> 11:46.873
Please, call me Barbara.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.792
Barbara. Delighted to meet you.

11:52.503 --> 11:53.922
-He really likes you.
-Yeah.

11:54.005 --> 11:54.839
[door opens, closes]

11:54.923 --> 11:57.342
I've never seen a teacher
take such an interest before.

11:58.760 --> 12:02.388
And he has a point. There are
only so many hours in the day, Jim.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.265
If your grades slip, even a little,

12:04.349 --> 12:07.977
I'm going to insist you cut back,
starting with the things you do for me.

12:08.061 --> 12:09.646
I like taking care of you.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.273
Except that it's my job
to take care of you.

12:13.691 --> 12:18.279
Do you know when I was old enough to ask
about Dad, remember what you told me?

12:18.947 --> 12:24.410
You said, "We just have to take care
of each other." That's all I'm doing, Mom.

12:28.039 --> 12:29.540
You must be starving.

12:29.624 --> 12:33.628
How about breakfast for dinner?
Even I can't screw up an omelet.

12:33.711 --> 12:36.172
-[chuckles] Wouldn't be so sure.
-What?

12:36.255 --> 12:37.340
I said, "Sure!"

12:40.760 --> 12:43.179
You shouldn't be here!

12:43.262 --> 12:45.264
[growls]

12:46.182 --> 12:49.894
Why aren't I feeling his neck snap
in my hands right now?

12:49.978 --> 12:51.896
Burning his hut to the ground?

12:51.980 --> 12:55.608
[scoffs] That certainly wouldn't
draw any attention.

12:55.692 --> 12:58.111
I could take the amulet
and be done with it.

12:58.194 --> 13:01.864
Your attempt to do so earlier
was not only unsuccessful,

13:01.948 --> 13:06.035
it risked exposing our agenda
to both humans and trolls.

13:06.119 --> 13:06.953
[snarls]

13:07.036 --> 13:13.543
First human Trollhunter.
This will require finesse, patience.

13:13.626 --> 13:17.714
I resent your weak, devious ways, Impure.

13:17.797 --> 13:21.676
-I only respect force.
-And I respect your father.

13:21.759 --> 13:27.140
If you want any chance
of ever seeing him again, adapt.

13:27.223 --> 13:28.808
[sighs]

13:33.479 --> 13:36.190
You know,
that's actually pretty delicious.

13:36.274 --> 13:40.319
So, Mr. Strickler,
he seems very nice. Is he single?

13:40.403 --> 13:45.408
-What? I-I don't know.
-[siren blaring in distance]

13:46.868 --> 13:48.786
Wider stance. Keep your frame.

13:48.870 --> 13:51.289
No, that's good, that's good.
Yes, all right, fine.

13:51.372 --> 13:55.001
That's better. All right.
Raise your sword, Master Jim. Mm-hmm.

13:55.084 --> 13:57.754
Head up, chin out, stomach in.

13:57.837 --> 14:00.923
[burps]
Mmm... What's this?

14:01.007 --> 14:04.427
Dander from my Nana's Persian
and a couple of hairballs.

14:04.510 --> 14:06.888
Mm, tasty. [burps]

14:06.971 --> 14:10.516
The Trollhunter lives and dies
by three rules.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.311
Rule number one: always be afraid.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.313
-Afraid?
-Be afraid.

14:15.396 --> 14:17.815
Yeah, I don't think
that'll be a problem. Whoa!

14:18.858 --> 14:23.071
See? Fear is good. Keeps us alert.
Keeps us on guard. Makes us vigilant.

14:24.113 --> 14:28.034
A hero is not he who is fearless,
but he who is not stopped by it.

14:28.117 --> 14:30.828
-Got it.
-Two: always finish the fight.

14:30.912 --> 14:33.247
An opponent must be given no mercy.

14:33.331 --> 14:37.043
-[gasps]
-[laughing]

14:37.126 --> 14:39.420
[Jim] Okay, enough
with the rocks, already.

14:40.129 --> 14:41.631
[breathing heavily]

14:41.714 --> 14:43.633
Always finish the fight? [grunts]

14:43.716 --> 14:45.134
Kill!

14:45.218 --> 14:49.472
Indeed. The Trollhunter must always
vanquish his opponent through death.

14:49.555 --> 14:52.683
-Dude, that's harsh.
-Ours is an unforgiving world, Toby D.

14:52.767 --> 14:56.896
Hence, the third rule: when in doubt,
always kick them in the gronk-nuks.

14:56.979 --> 14:58.481
Gronk-nuks?

14:59.816 --> 15:00.900
[screams]

15:01.734 --> 15:03.027
The horror.

15:04.153 --> 15:08.116
So, basically, you're saying
that one third of being a Trollhunter

15:08.199 --> 15:09.826
is kicking someone in the nards.

15:09.909 --> 15:13.871
Ah! So, the Trollhunter's training begins.

15:13.955 --> 15:20.378
I thought the great Trollhunter might
accept my services as a sparring partner.

15:20.461 --> 15:22.922
Part of your training regiment, isn't it?

15:23.005 --> 15:25.174
-In due time, perhaps.
-[Vendel] Why wait?

15:26.509 --> 15:30.930
I am eager to see your charge
demonstrate his mettle.

15:31.013 --> 15:33.474
Actually, the sword's more
made of, like, daylight.

15:33.558 --> 15:36.686
He means your mettle, your ability
to cope in the face of adversity.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.730
Oh. Yeah, I'm still working
on the whole "mettle" part.

15:39.814 --> 15:41.732
Plus, you know, SAT words.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.985
[chuckles]
Let them spar.

15:44.068 --> 15:46.112
No harm in it.

15:48.322 --> 15:51.200
-Wait, what do I do?
-Hit him as hard as you can.

15:51.284 --> 15:55.371
No, no. I mean, what do I do?
I've never hit anyone.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.582
-Ever?
-I've never gotten into a fight.

15:57.665 --> 16:00.376
-In your entire life?
-All 15 years of it, yeah.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.628
You fought Bular, however briefly,
and you were glorious.

16:02.712 --> 16:05.715
-Your blade-work was impressive.
-Those were just my chef skills!

16:05.798 --> 16:12.805
Exactly! The fight is within you,
Master Jim. Trust yourself. One hit!

16:12.889 --> 16:16.225
One hit and you will be changed forever.

16:17.727 --> 16:18.561
Begin.

16:22.148 --> 16:25.818
[snarling]

16:25.902 --> 16:27.904
[roars]

16:27.987 --> 16:29.113
One hit.

16:31.032 --> 16:31.949
[yells]

16:42.502 --> 16:45.713
[groans] All right, all right.
Now, just give me a second here.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.217
[yells]

16:50.718 --> 16:53.012
[breathing heavily]

16:53.095 --> 16:55.264
[Jim yells]

16:55.932 --> 16:57.308
[screams]

16:57.391 --> 16:59.810
-Let him go!
-[Jim yells]

16:59.894 --> 17:03.397
I've waited my entire life
to inherit the amulet.

17:03.481 --> 17:06.025
I can wait until you fall in battle.

17:07.151 --> 17:09.444
[screams, groans]

17:09.529 --> 17:12.323
I suspect I won't have to wait very long.

17:12.406 --> 17:17.494
If you know what's good for you,
you'll stay down and live, worm.

17:17.578 --> 17:20.665
[laughs]
Trollhunter.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.709
[sighs]

17:28.339 --> 17:32.051
He might be right.
What the heck was I thinking?

17:32.134 --> 17:34.971
An amulet can't choose anyone.
It's an amulet.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.389
Jim?

17:37.014 --> 17:40.935
I understand you're upset, Master Jim,
but you've had not a moment's training.

17:41.018 --> 17:43.229
There's no shame in what just transpired.

17:43.312 --> 17:47.483
Okay. Well, then you were definitely
not paying attention back there.

17:47.567 --> 17:51.862
Shame was about
the only thing that transpired.

17:51.946 --> 17:55.199
Shame... [sighs] and realization.

17:55.283 --> 17:59.328
I don't know if Draal should be
the Trollhunter or not, and I don't care.

17:59.412 --> 18:02.415
I just know that I am not.

18:04.959 --> 18:08.713
Master Jim, despite whatever doubts
you may have about the amulet's choice,

18:08.796 --> 18:10.965
it is now bonded to you.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.260
This is a mantle you cannot refuse.

18:16.971 --> 18:18.222
Watch me.

18:24.604 --> 18:25.438
[groans]

18:28.899 --> 18:29.775
Oh, shut up.

18:34.155 --> 18:35.531
[exhales]

18:40.536 --> 18:41.662
[groans]

18:42.538 --> 18:43.456
[spits]

18:43.831 --> 18:44.707
[screams]

18:46.959 --> 18:48.628
<i>¡Buenas noches!</i>

18:50.254 --> 18:51.547
Home run.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.591
[yells]

18:55.551 --> 18:56.510
Really?

18:56.594 --> 18:59.472
"Deny and refuse."
But he can't deny it.

18:59.555 --> 19:03.100
But Romeo can't not be a Montague,
which means that Juliet...

19:03.184 --> 19:07.313
-"And I'll no longer be a Capulet."
-Exactly! [laughs] Jim?

19:07.396 --> 19:08.439
Huh?

19:08.522 --> 19:10.941
"Or, if thou wilt not,
be sworn my love..."

19:11.025 --> 19:13.861
Right. No, I-I got it.
Love, deny, refuse. I'm on it.

19:13.944 --> 19:17.365
Okay, then. Let's take it
from "Wherefore art..."

19:17.448 --> 19:19.825
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine. [chuckles] Totally fine.

19:19.909 --> 19:23.746
You're going to need to be a bit more
convincing if you're going to play Romeo.

19:23.829 --> 19:26.624
I've just got some stuff
going on in my head.

19:26.707 --> 19:29.126
I know we don't know
each other all that well,

19:29.210 --> 19:32.463
but we're going to be spending
a lot of time together, so--

19:32.546 --> 19:36.967
All right, all right!
Act two, scene two, line 33.

19:37.051 --> 19:38.761
"Wherefore art thou, Romeo?"

19:41.305 --> 19:43.432
[Steve]
Where have you been?

19:43.516 --> 19:46.936
I scheduled your butt-whooping
for yesterday, jerk face.

19:47.019 --> 19:50.189
And you didn't show.
Tick-tock, remember?

19:50.272 --> 19:53.275
He was busy getting his butt
whooped by someone else.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.361
-Take a number.
-Back off, dweeb!

19:55.444 --> 19:58.864
Steve, I am really not in the mood
to do this right now.

19:58.948 --> 20:03.160
Duh! Nobody's ever in the mood
to get their face bashed in,

20:03.244 --> 20:06.539
but that's what's going to happen,
unless you want to back down.

20:06.622 --> 20:08.416
-Uh, I-I can do that?
-Sure.

20:08.499 --> 20:10.668
You want to crawl away from me,

20:10.751 --> 20:13.713
on your knees,
bowing in front of everybody?

20:13.796 --> 20:15.131
[Steve chuckles]

20:15.214 --> 20:18.843
-That's a choice.
-[students murmuring]

20:18.926 --> 20:22.596
Whoa! I didn't expect you to actually
choose wussing over whooping.

20:22.680 --> 20:23.973
[Steve laughs]

20:28.352 --> 20:30.104
-[groans]
-[grunts]

20:31.105 --> 20:33.524
Keep still so I can punch your face!

20:38.696 --> 20:40.239
-[groans]
-[amulet dings]

20:40.322 --> 20:41.615
[Steve laughs]

20:41.699 --> 20:44.785
Stay down and live, worm.

20:48.539 --> 20:50.624
-Is that all you got?
-[growls]

20:51.500 --> 20:52.710
Leave him alone, Steve!

20:52.793 --> 20:54.003
-Butt out!
-Claire!

20:54.086 --> 20:55.546
[laughs]

20:55.629 --> 20:59.675
-Good thing your mom's a nurse.
-One hit.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.051
-[bones crack]
-[grunts]

21:02.344 --> 21:04.680
[groans]

21:07.725 --> 21:09.351
She's a doctor, actually.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.896
[students cheer]

21:11.979 --> 21:17.359
Got one! Dude, you did it! And without
even kicking him in the gronk-nuks!

21:21.238 --> 21:24.450
[Draal]
It was an epic pummeling! [laughs]

21:24.533 --> 21:29.371
I was going to kill him, but I just
couldn't make up my mind as to how.

21:29.455 --> 21:30.790
[laughs]

21:31.373 --> 21:36.170
"Trollhunter." [scoffs]
I mean, "trollhunted" is more like it.

21:36.253 --> 21:38.297
[laughs]

21:38.380 --> 21:41.342
If only Master Jim had landed
a single hit.

21:41.425 --> 21:42.843
Single hit.

21:42.927 --> 21:45.137
And he would have been changed forever!

21:45.221 --> 21:49.016
[laughs]
Over and over and over.

21:49.099 --> 21:50.935
It was incredible!

21:51.018 --> 21:55.105
All I want is the chance to wail
on that fleshbag again.

21:56.232 --> 21:58.734
Wish granted, loudmouth. Rematch.

21:58.818 --> 22:03.072
You. Me. Name the time,
name the place, and I'll be there.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.323
We both will.

22:05.491 --> 22:08.452
Changed forever.

22:08.536 --> 22:10.162
