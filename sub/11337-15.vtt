WEBVTT

00:03.237 --> 00:05.104
Move in now.

00:05.106 --> 00:06.338
JULES (over radio):
Sarge, can't see any movement.

00:10.144 --> 00:12.144
ED:
Door's jammed from the inside.
(people shouting inside)

00:12.146 --> 00:13.045
Spike, any other way in?

00:13.047 --> 00:14.513
Negative.

00:14.515 --> 00:16.348
Wordy, hurry,
we need the umbrella.

00:17.284 --> 00:19.284
(shouting continues)

00:23.391 --> 00:25.157
(panicked shouting inside)

00:25.159 --> 00:26.358
We gotta get in there.

00:26.360 --> 00:27.659
Everyone inside the barn

00:27.661 --> 00:29.595
stand back from
the doors!

00:29.597 --> 00:31.163
Stay back!

00:50.785 --> 00:52.217
(exasperated sigh)

00:53.587 --> 00:56.288
You gotta pay
inside first.

00:56.290 --> 00:59.158
What?

00:59.160 --> 01:01.226
No one trusts
anyone anymore.

01:05.666 --> 01:07.433
You okay?

01:07.435 --> 01:10.803
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:10.805 --> 01:12.604
(sighing)

01:32.860 --> 01:35.260
(door bell jingles)

01:35.262 --> 01:38.397
There you go.
Have a great day.

01:41.669 --> 01:43.569
(door bell jingles)

01:44.538 --> 01:45.838
How you doing?

01:45.840 --> 01:47.473
Can I help you find something?

01:49.243 --> 01:51.143
I need some money.

01:51.145 --> 01:53.512
Okay, the, uh,
ATM's just in the back.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.557
Whoa!

02:04.558 --> 02:06.325
Please, just give me the money.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.381
That's it.

02:29.383 --> 02:31.283
This is all you have?

02:31.284 --> 02:33.184
We don't usually keep
a lot of money in the register.

02:33.187 --> 02:34.853
No, that's not enough.
I need more.

02:34.855 --> 02:37.389
Don't these places
have some kind of safe?

02:37.391 --> 02:39.191
Yes, but this is my second day--
I don't know how to open it.

02:39.193 --> 02:41.593
(toilet flushing)

02:41.595 --> 02:42.794
(door opening)

02:42.796 --> 02:44.763
Keep your hands up.
Keep your hands up.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.532
Stay quiet.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.333
GIRL:
Can we please have one?

02:48.335 --> 02:50.369
Nope...
Please, Mom.

02:50.371 --> 02:51.203
Stay where you are!

02:51.205 --> 02:52.838
Oh! Oh, God.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.206
Oh, please don't...

02:54.208 --> 02:56.208
Please don't hurt us.
Give me your purse.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.442
Take it, take it.
Just take it, take it, take it.

02:57.444 --> 03:00.679
Take it.
You, move! Go stand next to her!

03:00.681 --> 03:02.581
Keep your hands up
where I can see them!

03:02.583 --> 03:03.749
(quietly):
It's okay.

03:03.751 --> 03:06.318
Your car,
does it have gas in it?

03:06.320 --> 03:07.486
Yes, yeah.

03:07.488 --> 03:08.754
I just filled it up, it's yours.

03:08.756 --> 03:09.821
Okay, that's good.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.757
(sirens wailing)
Okay.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.692
Now you're gonna come
with me, come here.
Oh, God, no.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.327
Okay, okay, just, okay.
Mommy!

03:15.329 --> 03:16.728
It's okay, baby, it's okay.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.330
You stay there!
Stay there!

03:18.332 --> 03:19.565
It's okay, it's okay.
Go.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.200
Go slowly.
Okay, okay.

03:21.202 --> 03:23.302
Wait, wait, wait,
wait. No...

03:23.304 --> 03:24.937
Oh, my God, no.

03:24.939 --> 03:26.738
No, no!
(tires screeching)

03:26.740 --> 03:29.341
Go back, go back!
All right,
all right!

03:29.343 --> 03:30.876
Stay there.
Keep your hands up!
All right, all right!

03:30.878 --> 03:33.912
No!
No, I can't let them take me!

03:35.449 --> 03:37.216
It's okay, honey.
It's okay.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.317
(locking door)

03:38.319 --> 03:40.219
It's gonna be okay, baby.

03:40.221 --> 03:42.287
We're all right.
Stay quiet!

03:48.395 --> 03:50.996
You break that bag,
they don't give us another one.

03:50.998 --> 03:53.332
You know what,
I'm just a little frustrated.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.234
Clark's beating me up,
he wants to go to a party,

03:55.236 --> 03:56.868
I won't let him go--
it's just a hassle.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.003
What's the big deal?

03:58.005 --> 03:59.304
I'll tell you what
the big deal is,

03:59.306 --> 04:00.872
there's no parental
supervision.

04:00.874 --> 04:02.407
Oh, parents away,
kid takes advantage?

04:02.409 --> 04:04.943
You telling me you never
went to a party like that

04:04.945 --> 04:06.311
when you were Clark's age?

04:06.313 --> 04:07.963
Why do you think
I don't want him to go?

04:07.964 --> 04:09.614
No offense, Ed,
but your kid plays the cello.

04:09.617 --> 04:11.383
I don't know how much trouble
he's really gonna get into.
Funny.

04:11.385 --> 04:12.718
WINNIE:
Team one, hot call.
Funny stuff.

04:12.720 --> 04:14.753
Hostage situation, gas station.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.455
528 Brock Road.

04:17.758 --> 04:20.993
(sirens wailing)

04:28.802 --> 04:31.370
All right, Leah, Wordy,
cover the exits.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.838
We need a hard perimeter
on this.

04:32.840 --> 04:34.340
Copy.
Copy that.

04:34.341 --> 04:35.841
Sam, let me know how many
hostages we got in there.

04:35.842 --> 04:37.342
SPIKE:
Might be able to get a snake cam
in through the garage.

04:37.344 --> 04:39.544
I'm on it.
Okay, Spike,
get the truck.

04:39.546 --> 04:41.613
Copy that.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.584
How many subjects you say?
Just one, a woman.

04:45.586 --> 04:47.352
At least one hostage,
maybe more.

04:47.354 --> 04:48.854
Mm-hmm. You have any
contact with her?

04:48.856 --> 04:50.422
She started screaming at us
to go away,

04:50.424 --> 04:51.690
waving the gun around.

04:51.692 --> 04:53.492
Seems unstable.
Who called 911?

04:54.461 --> 04:56.461
Okay, thanks a lot.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.463
Let's go, Jules.

04:58.465 --> 04:59.798
PARKER:
Hello, sir.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.333
You called 911?

05:01.335 --> 05:02.901
Yes, sir, I did.
What did she seem like

05:02.903 --> 05:04.369
when you talked to her?

05:04.371 --> 05:05.537
Uh, she was scared.

05:05.539 --> 05:06.938
Kind of jumpy.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.540
Which car was hers?
The red one.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.375
Okay. Yeah.

05:10.377 --> 05:12.778
Please stay right there.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.379
Eddie, we're coming in.

05:14.381 --> 05:17.949
Looks like the plates
have expired.

05:17.951 --> 05:19.851
Yeah, like, um,

05:19.853 --> 05:22.354
15 years ago.

05:22.356 --> 05:24.456
Spike, I need you
to run some plates.

05:24.458 --> 05:26.558
Tango, three, uniform,

05:26.560 --> 05:27.859
Zulu, niner, seven, niner.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.728
SPIKE:
Copy that.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.837
She can't get out this way.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.606
Rear door secure.

05:43.377 --> 05:45.444
Damn it, they're everywhere.

05:50.984 --> 05:53.952
Isn't there any other way out?

05:53.954 --> 05:55.554
No.

05:55.556 --> 05:57.122
You should just
give yourself up.

05:57.124 --> 05:58.924
PARKER (over bullhorn):
I'm talking to the lady
in the store

05:58.926 --> 06:00.792
who's in charge right now.

06:00.794 --> 06:03.128
This is the
Police Strategic Response Unit.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.731
I'll be calling
the store phone shortly.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.432
I need you to pick it up.

06:07.434 --> 06:10.435
(phone ringing)

06:13.507 --> 06:14.940
(line ringing)

06:19.413 --> 06:21.446
Go away!
PARKER:
How you doing?

06:21.448 --> 06:22.881
My name is Greg Parker.

06:22.883 --> 06:24.116
Can you tell me your name?

06:25.085 --> 06:27.386
Okay, can you tell me
how many people

06:27.388 --> 06:28.453
you have in there with you?

06:28.455 --> 06:30.655
Three.

06:30.657 --> 06:31.990
That's good.
How are they?

06:31.992 --> 06:33.091
Are they okay?

06:33.093 --> 06:34.526
Yes.

06:34.528 --> 06:35.978
I'm glad to hear that.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.429
Now, I want to make sure
that everyone in there

06:37.431 --> 06:39.531
comes out safely,
and that includes you.

06:39.533 --> 06:41.767
Then stay away and let me go.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.168
Well, I just want to help you.

06:43.170 --> 06:44.536
You're a cop.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.522
That's right.

06:46.523 --> 06:48.507
So tell me
why I should trust you.

06:48.509 --> 06:49.541
Don't...
Oh!

06:52.546 --> 06:54.012
Hey, Spike,
you run those plates yet?

06:54.014 --> 06:55.647
(typing)

06:55.649 --> 06:58.016
Car is registered
to a Rachel Simpson.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.785
You got a photo?

06:59.787 --> 07:00.919
Sending it to you now.

07:05.692 --> 07:07.526
Mr. Milroy,

07:07.528 --> 07:09.594
is that the woman?

07:09.596 --> 07:11.530
Yeah, she's older than that,

07:11.532 --> 07:12.831
but that's, yeah,
definitely her.

07:12.833 --> 07:14.566
Well, thanks.

07:14.568 --> 07:17.869
Address on the license is her
parents' place in Forest Hill.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.171
They still live there.

07:19.173 --> 07:21.173
What's an uptown girl doing
robbing a gas station?

07:21.175 --> 07:23.608
And driving an old beater?

07:23.610 --> 07:26.578
Okay, go talk to the parents,
see what you can find out.

07:26.580 --> 07:27.846
On it.

07:27.848 --> 07:28.980
How you doing, Eddie,

07:28.982 --> 07:30.148
got eyes yet?

07:30.150 --> 07:33.218
Boss, we're working on it.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.586
Sam, what do we got?

07:34.588 --> 07:36.455
Almost there.

07:42.796 --> 07:44.663
We've got eyes.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.504
KATE SIMPSON:
<i> We have to go down there,</i>

07:52.506 --> 07:53.738
try to talk to her.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.240
She hasn't talked to us
in 15 years.

07:55.242 --> 07:57.576
You think she wants
to start now?

07:57.578 --> 07:59.578
Where has she been living
all this time?

07:59.580 --> 08:00.479
A place called the Farm.

08:00.481 --> 08:02.013
The rehab facility?

08:02.015 --> 08:04.115
Does she have
an addiction problem?

08:04.117 --> 08:06.518
Rachel started drinking
when she was 14.

08:06.520 --> 08:10.555
By the time she turned 16,
she'd moved on to cocaine.

08:10.557 --> 08:11.957
Was it your idea
for her to go to rehab?

08:11.959 --> 08:14.759
I came home one afternoon,

08:14.761 --> 08:16.495
found her passed out
on the floor.

08:16.497 --> 08:19.564
I tried to wake her,
but I couldn't.

08:19.566 --> 08:21.600
I was so scared.

08:21.602 --> 08:23.535
PARKER:
<i> Okay, subject is armed</i>

08:23.537 --> 08:24.669
with what looks like

08:24.671 --> 08:26.571
a .380?
Yeah.

08:26.573 --> 08:29.641
Three hostages-- two
adults, one little girl.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.843
So far they look unharmed.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.745
Rachel Simpson's clean as
a whistle, no criminal record.

08:33.747 --> 08:35.514
She been the victim of a crime?

08:35.516 --> 08:36.681
Nothing's coming up.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.583
SAM:
So what's her problem with cops?

08:38.585 --> 08:40.585
PARKER:
Could be dealing with some
kind of paranoid disorder.

08:40.587 --> 08:41.686
Let's hope she doesn't think

08:41.688 --> 08:43.622
the hostages
are out to get her, too.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.557
Uh, I don't think
she seems them as the enemy.

08:45.559 --> 08:47.626
What are our tactical options?

08:47.628 --> 08:49.294
Explosive entry
through the door?

08:49.295 --> 08:50.961
Can't take the chance
of setting Rachel off.

08:50.964 --> 08:52.597
Not with that little girl
in there.

08:52.599 --> 08:54.633
Okay, let me work on that.

08:54.635 --> 08:56.535
I want to go home.
(phone ringing)

08:56.537 --> 08:57.969
I know, sweetie.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.674
They're just trying to help.

09:04.678 --> 09:07.546
I told you if you want this
to end, you have to leave.

09:07.548 --> 09:08.680
I can't do that, Rachel.

09:10.317 --> 09:11.950
How do you know my name?

09:11.952 --> 09:13.218
Rachel, listen to me.

09:13.220 --> 09:14.819
You want to get out of there,

09:14.821 --> 09:16.888
I want to help you
do that but first

09:16.890 --> 09:18.223
you have to let these people go.

09:18.225 --> 09:19.558
You're just trying to get me
to open the door,

09:19.560 --> 09:20.892
so you can shoot me.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.060
No, no.

09:22.062 --> 09:23.328
I give you my word, Rachel,

09:23.330 --> 09:24.896
that's not gonna happen.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.198
Okay, you don't want
to let everybody go,

09:27.200 --> 09:29.901
how about you let the mom
and the little girl go?

09:33.974 --> 09:35.907
All right.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.610
Thank you, Rachel. Thank you.

09:38.612 --> 09:41.346
Okay, here's what's
gonna happen next.

09:41.348 --> 09:43.014
I'm gonna have one of my men
waiting near the front door,

09:43.016 --> 09:44.716
but he's not there to hurt you.

09:44.718 --> 09:48.086
He's there to help the woman
and the child get to safety.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.155
Okay.

09:51.658 --> 09:53.625
RICK SIMPSON:
<i> The Farm was supposed to be</i>

09:53.627 --> 09:55.594
a really good facility.

09:55.596 --> 09:58.597
All about living off the land
and getting back to nature.

09:58.599 --> 10:00.632
Rachel get clean?

10:00.634 --> 10:01.933
Yes, but then

10:01.935 --> 10:04.352
she wouldn't come home.

10:04.353 --> 10:06.770
And then we found out that she
and Charles had gotten married.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.673
Who's Charles?
Charles Stewart.

10:08.675 --> 10:09.641
He runs the Farm.

10:09.643 --> 10:11.676
Do you have his number?

10:11.678 --> 10:12.911
I need to talk to him.

10:12.913 --> 10:14.279
KATE:
Charles doesn't have a phone.

10:14.281 --> 10:17.282
He doesn't want any contact
with the outside world.

10:17.284 --> 10:20.285
Right, I did hear that
the facility is very secretive.

10:20.287 --> 10:22.787
He wouldn't even let us
talk to our own daughter.

10:22.789 --> 10:24.189
A friend of ours is a cop.

10:24.191 --> 10:25.256
We brought him back there
with us,

10:25.258 --> 10:26.725
see if he could
intimidate Charles

10:26.727 --> 10:28.159
into letting us see Rachel.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.728
That work?
She said that

10:29.730 --> 10:33.064
we were a negative influence
on her life

10:33.066 --> 10:35.700
and that she never
wanted to see us again.

10:35.702 --> 10:36.668
Charles had already

10:36.670 --> 10:38.703
turned her against us.

10:38.705 --> 10:42.941
RICK:
Officer Callaghan,
Charles has got a real hold on

10:42.943 --> 10:44.376
our daughter.

10:44.378 --> 10:46.811
Now, if she is robbing
a gas station,

10:46.813 --> 10:49.814
I wouldn't be surprised
if he was the one behind it.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.883
Okay.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.286
ED:
The Farm.

10:55.288 --> 10:58.289
Didn't the police investigate
that place a couple years ago?

10:58.291 --> 10:59.824
Yeah, but no charges were laid.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.292
JULES:
Okay, I'm gonna head
over there and see

11:01.294 --> 11:02.861
if I can talk
to Charles Stewart.

11:02.863 --> 11:04.663
Maybe he can tell us
why Rachel's doing this.

11:04.665 --> 11:06.431
Jules, send me the address,
I'll meet you there.

11:06.433 --> 11:09.401
Sam, I'm gonna put you
in charge of tactical.

11:09.403 --> 11:11.903
Be ready with entry options
in case negotiations fail.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.271
All right, you got it.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.140
Wordy?

11:15.142 --> 11:17.409
Go slowly
towards the door.
It's gonna be okay.

11:17.411 --> 11:19.244
SPIKE:
She's getting ready to come out.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.783
Everyone maintain position.

11:24.785 --> 11:26.384
You open the
door slowly.
Okay, okay.

11:26.386 --> 11:27.752
Go slow,
go slow.
Okay, okay.

11:27.754 --> 11:29.120
Don't hurt me.

11:29.122 --> 11:30.755
Don't hurt my little girl.

11:30.757 --> 11:31.990
Go, lady,
go, go.

11:31.992 --> 11:33.458
It's okay, honey.
Grab my hand.

11:33.460 --> 11:35.026
Come towards me.
That's right.
Just go slowly.

11:35.028 --> 11:36.327
Slowly.
Ma'am, just come
towards us slowly.

11:36.329 --> 11:38.263
Okay, let her go.
Oh, God...

11:38.265 --> 11:39.982
Just grab my arm.
Oh, please.

11:39.983 --> 11:41.700
Go right behind me...
Stay right behind me, okay?

11:41.702 --> 11:43.085
Very slowly.
Oh, God.

11:43.086 --> 11:44.469
Oh, my God. No, you
have to come back in!

11:44.471 --> 11:47.238
Rachel. Rachel, it's okay.
It's okay, Rachel.

11:47.240 --> 11:49.407
No!
Come back in!

11:49.409 --> 11:51.309
PARKER:
Rachel, it's okay.

11:51.311 --> 11:52.977
(frustrated scream)

11:56.316 --> 11:57.782
(grunting)

11:58.785 --> 12:00.285
(grunts)

12:00.287 --> 12:01.786
(Rachel muttering)

12:01.788 --> 12:03.855
Don't! Please! Let me go.

12:03.857 --> 12:05.990
How do I get out?!
(crying):
I don't know.

12:05.992 --> 12:11.296
  Captioning sponsored by
  CBS

12:38.091 --> 12:39.324
I got to get out of here!

12:39.326 --> 12:44.028
(grunting)

12:44.030 --> 12:47.065
(yells)

12:47.067 --> 12:49.801
She's completely shutting down.

13:01.014 --> 13:03.248
Well, it's definitely
isolated.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.316
Yeah.

13:08.522 --> 13:10.789
ED:
Hey, buddy.

13:11.792 --> 13:14.425
ED:
Hey!

13:15.395 --> 13:17.028
Is it something you said?

13:17.030 --> 13:18.363
What can I tell you?

13:18.365 --> 13:20.064
I got a way
with teenagers.

13:20.066 --> 13:22.167
I don't know.

13:22.169 --> 13:23.468
An electric fence. Wow.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.836
Pretty serious

13:24.838 --> 13:26.204
about keeping people out.

13:26.206 --> 13:28.173
I guess so.

13:35.115 --> 13:36.047
This is private property.

13:36.049 --> 13:37.315
Sir, I'm Ed Lane.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.450
This is Jules Callaghan.
We're with the police.

13:39.452 --> 13:40.819
Are you Charles Stewart?

13:40.821 --> 13:43.188
What is this about?
Mr. Stewart,

13:43.190 --> 13:45.156
your wife robbed a gas station
this morning, she's holding

13:45.158 --> 13:46.457
three people hostage.

13:46.459 --> 13:47.992
Oh, God.

13:47.994 --> 13:49.994
My mother would never
do something like that.

13:49.996 --> 13:51.196
Isaac.

13:51.198 --> 13:52.096
She's your mother?

13:52.098 --> 13:53.264
ED:
Mr. Stewart,

13:53.266 --> 13:54.966
if you could just
open the gate here,

13:54.968 --> 13:57.101
we need to talk to you
about Rachel.

13:58.872 --> 14:00.905
Isaac?

14:00.907 --> 14:03.041
I'd prefer it

14:03.043 --> 14:04.876
if you left
your weapons outside.

14:04.878 --> 14:06.110
That's against regulations.

14:06.112 --> 14:08.413
We're just here to talk, sir.

14:19.125 --> 14:21.192
ED:
So, you had no idea

14:21.194 --> 14:22.594
your wife left the
Farm this morning?

14:22.596 --> 14:23.962
None at all.

14:23.964 --> 14:25.129
Is-is Rachel okay?

14:25.131 --> 14:26.664
She hasn't hurt anyone, has she?

14:26.665 --> 14:28.198
No she hasn't, but we
need your help so that

14:28.201 --> 14:30.635
we can keep
everybody safe.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.503
Um, Isaac...

14:32.505 --> 14:34.472
go finish your chores,

14:34.474 --> 14:36.107
then work on
your book report.

14:36.109 --> 14:37.876
Yes, sir.

14:37.878 --> 14:41.079
Sir, do you know why
Rachel is doing this?

14:42.315 --> 14:45.416
Mr. Stewart,
if you know anything,

14:45.418 --> 14:48.019
you need to tell us.

14:48.021 --> 14:50.455
Uh, Rachel hasn't
been herself lately.

14:50.457 --> 14:52.991
She's been moody, distant.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.993
I'm worried she's gone back
to her old ways.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.160
You think she's using again?

14:56.162 --> 14:57.562
I don't know.

14:57.563 --> 14:58.963
How else do you
explain her behavior?

14:58.965 --> 15:00.298
Bring her back here.
She needs help.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.533
This is the best place
for her.
Mr. Stewart,

15:02.535 --> 15:06.170
I've never seen a rehab facility
with an electric fence before.

15:06.172 --> 15:07.922
The world's a dangerous place.

15:07.923 --> 15:09.673
I do whatever I can to
keep my people safe.

15:09.676 --> 15:11.209
Okay, we're gonna
need to talk

15:11.211 --> 15:12.944
to some
of Rachel's friends here.

15:12.946 --> 15:14.112
These people--

15:14.114 --> 15:15.313
they're recovering addicts.

15:15.315 --> 15:16.648
I'm sure you can appreciate

15:16.650 --> 15:18.950
how upsetting it might be
to be interrogated

15:18.952 --> 15:20.585
by the police?

15:20.586 --> 15:22.219
I understand that, but
right now, sir, we need to do

15:22.222 --> 15:24.673
everything that we can

15:24.674 --> 15:27.125
to make sure that Rachel and
everybody else gets out safely.

15:27.127 --> 15:28.559
Charles?

15:28.561 --> 15:30.161
What is it, James?

15:30.163 --> 15:32.630
I need to speak with you.

15:32.632 --> 15:35.366
Excuse me a moment.

15:35.368 --> 15:37.702
PARKER:
Okay, what's going on there,

15:37.704 --> 15:39.604
Eddie? What's the situation?

15:41.574 --> 15:44.042
I'm telling you, boss,
this guy's hiding something.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.644
Okay, you keep looking.

15:45.645 --> 15:47.245
Got Rachel here--
feels like she's shutting down.

15:47.247 --> 15:49.280
I think she might be
using again.

15:49.282 --> 15:52.550
We can't take that chance,
so we need to go tactical.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.619
How do you want to go in?

15:56.056 --> 15:59.257
(Rachel screaming)

15:59.259 --> 16:00.658
(coughing)

16:04.497 --> 16:07.665
Police! Drop your weapon!
Drop your weapon!
(screaming)

16:07.667 --> 16:10.368
No!

16:17.477 --> 16:18.710
No!
Come on.

16:18.712 --> 16:20.611
No! Let me go!
It's gonna
be okay.

16:20.613 --> 16:23.147
Let me go. I
have to go back.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.083
I have to save my son!

16:25.085 --> 16:27.051
What's wrong with your son?

16:27.053 --> 16:28.419
Just let me go.

16:28.421 --> 16:29.988
Please?

16:29.990 --> 16:32.090
If your son's
in trouble,

16:32.092 --> 16:34.492
Rachel, you can tell us.

16:34.494 --> 16:37.362
I can't.
Yes, you can,
you can try.

16:37.364 --> 16:40.465
He's gonna kill everybody.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.066
Who? Who's gonna kill everybody?

16:42.068 --> 16:43.334
Charles!

16:43.336 --> 16:45.370
I have to go back!

16:45.372 --> 16:47.372
You have to let me go.

16:47.374 --> 16:49.173
Please.

16:49.175 --> 16:52.176
(panting)

16:52.178 --> 16:54.412
I have to save my son.

16:55.382 --> 16:57.682
Please?!

16:57.684 --> 17:00.018
Please!

17:02.088 --> 17:04.422
PARKER:
Jules, Eddie, watch your backs.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.457
If Rachel's story checks out,

17:06.459 --> 17:10.194
Charles may be planning
a mass murder there today.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.296
Spike, what do we know
about Charles Stewart?

17:12.298 --> 17:13.998
Ex-heroin addict.

17:13.999 --> 17:15.699
Did some time
for possession when he was 18.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.802
Looks like he got clean,
started up

17:17.804 --> 17:19.337
the Farm about 20 years ago.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.339
About eight years ago,
a woman named Linda Gase

17:21.341 --> 17:22.673
went into the Farm
for treatment.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.225
Her husband claimed

17:24.226 --> 17:25.776
that Charles was keeping her
there against her will.

17:25.779 --> 17:27.578
Gave the police probable cause
to search the place.

17:27.580 --> 17:29.614
They raided the Farm in
the middle of the night,

17:29.616 --> 17:30.782
they turned it upside down.

17:30.784 --> 17:32.150
That'd explain

17:32.152 --> 17:33.184
the animosity toward the cops.

17:33.186 --> 17:34.318
And they find

17:34.320 --> 17:35.386
no weapons and no evidence

17:35.388 --> 17:36.554
of criminal activity.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.256
ED:
I'll track her down,

17:38.258 --> 17:40.391
see what we can find out.

17:45.298 --> 17:48.366
Mrs. Gase, Rachel is
in a lot of trouble.

17:48.368 --> 17:51.302
If you know anything,
please tell us.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.304
Rachel would never go back
to using drugs.

17:53.306 --> 17:55.506
She wouldn't do that to Isaac.

17:55.508 --> 17:57.542
Was she upset
about anything?

17:57.544 --> 17:59.644
Problems in
the marriage?

17:59.646 --> 18:02.480
She and Charles haven't
been getting along lately.

18:02.482 --> 18:03.815
Do you know why?

18:03.817 --> 18:06.551
She doesn't appreciate him.

18:06.553 --> 18:09.253
A man like Charles
deserves better than that.

18:09.255 --> 18:12.256
Wow. Sounds like
you're very fond of him.

18:12.258 --> 18:14.092
Before I met Charles,
I was hooked

18:14.094 --> 18:15.460
on meth.

18:15.462 --> 18:17.395
Charles saved my life.

18:17.397 --> 18:19.697
He saved all of us.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.332
He's a hero.

18:21.334 --> 18:23.134
I owe him everything.

18:23.136 --> 18:24.302
Your husband believed

18:24.304 --> 18:25.670
you were being kept here
against your will.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.472
He couldn't understand
why I didn't want to leave.

18:27.474 --> 18:30.141
This is my home now.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.743
It's the only place
I can be safe.

18:32.745 --> 18:35.213
Okay. Thank you.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.747
Excuse me.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.583
JULES:
How long have
you lived here?

18:38.585 --> 18:40.318
LINDA:
Eight years.

18:40.320 --> 18:43.821
Have you, um... have
you seen your family?

18:43.823 --> 18:45.623
You're pretty good with that ax.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.359
She never should have left
the Farm.

18:48.361 --> 18:50.328
It's too dangerous out there.

18:50.330 --> 18:51.629
Your father tell you that?

18:51.631 --> 18:53.664
He knows what's best for us.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.766
Let me ask you--
you and the, uh...

18:55.768 --> 18:57.768
you and the other kids--
you go to school around here?

18:57.770 --> 18:59.704
My father teaches us

18:59.706 --> 19:01.372
here at the Farm.

19:01.374 --> 19:02.673
So, what, so
you never leave?

19:02.675 --> 19:04.442
No need.

19:09.382 --> 19:10.815
<i> Huck Finn.</i>

19:10.817 --> 19:12.550
Pretty good book, right?

19:12.552 --> 19:13.551
Yeah.

19:13.553 --> 19:14.886
What do you
mean, yeah?

19:14.888 --> 19:16.287
Two guys
going down

19:16.289 --> 19:18.422
the Mississippi on a raft.

19:18.424 --> 19:19.891
Pretty exciting stuff, right?

19:19.893 --> 19:21.309
I guess.

19:21.310 --> 19:22.726
You never think about
doing anything like that?

19:22.729 --> 19:24.428
Getting out there, exploring?

19:26.633 --> 19:29.400
I have everything I need
right here.

19:29.402 --> 19:31.302
Why would I ever

19:31.304 --> 19:32.804
want to leave?

19:32.805 --> 19:34.305
ED:
<i> Boss, Charles has taught them</i>

19:34.307 --> 19:36.340
<i> to fear everything</i>
<i> outside the Farm.</i>

19:36.342 --> 19:38.309
His own son's never
been off the property.

19:38.311 --> 19:39.477
Yeah, you should hear

19:39.479 --> 19:41.179
how they talk
about this guy Charles.

19:41.181 --> 19:42.413
They're totally
devoted to him.

19:42.415 --> 19:44.315
This is sounding
like a cult mentality.

19:44.317 --> 19:45.449
JULES:
Yeah.

19:45.451 --> 19:46.817
The people, they come here,

19:46.819 --> 19:49.887
they're desperate,
and they give themselves over--

19:49.889 --> 19:51.556
mind, body and spirit.

19:51.558 --> 19:53.591
Yeah, trade one dependency
for another.

19:53.593 --> 19:55.193
ED:
To maintain control,

19:55.195 --> 19:57.328
he convinces them that
this is the only safe place.

19:57.330 --> 19:59.797
Okay, well, just take a look
around, see what you can find.

20:03.736 --> 20:04.902
I needed money and gas,

20:04.904 --> 20:07.438
and then I was gonna
go back and get Isaac.

20:07.440 --> 20:09.824
You should've gone
to the police.

20:09.825 --> 20:12.209
PARKER:
I know, Rachel, you think
we're the bad guys,

20:12.212 --> 20:13.978
but it's Charles
who's threatening

20:13.980 --> 20:17.448
to kill all those people,
including your son.

20:17.450 --> 20:18.482
No.

20:18.484 --> 20:19.984
Come on.

20:19.986 --> 20:22.553
Let me help you.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.990
I can't do that
until you start trusting me.

20:25.992 --> 20:28.659
Please.

20:48.481 --> 20:50.248
(gun cocking)

21:03.796 --> 21:05.696
Drop your weapon.

21:05.698 --> 21:08.666
Safety's on there, James.

21:08.668 --> 21:11.769
This is an MP5 submachine gun.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.471
Fires 800 rounds per minute,

21:13.473 --> 21:15.740
400 meters per second.

21:15.742 --> 21:17.892
So, unless you want
a demonstration,

21:17.893 --> 21:20.043
I suggest you drop your weapon,
and we can talk about this.

21:20.046 --> 21:22.446
My father was right.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.982
ISAAC:
You can't be trusted.

21:24.984 --> 21:26.784
Isaac, that's not true.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.786
We're here
to help you, son.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.855
You're lying.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.758
Isaac, put the gun down.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.459
Isaac!

21:35.461 --> 21:36.627
You first.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.496
Put it down!
Isaac.

21:38.498 --> 21:40.498
Do it.

21:40.500 --> 21:41.999
Okay, son.

21:42.001 --> 21:43.834
All right.

21:43.836 --> 21:45.303
Put your hands behind your head.

21:45.305 --> 21:46.504
Okay, take it easy.

21:46.506 --> 21:47.938
It's okay.

21:47.940 --> 21:49.006
Turn around.

21:59.819 --> 22:03.788
Charles is going to want
to have a word with you.

22:03.790 --> 22:04.922
Sarge, we've got a problem.

22:04.924 --> 22:06.857
They got Ed.
What's going on, Jules?

22:06.859 --> 22:10.394
Isaac and one of Charles' men
took him at gunpoint.

22:11.364 --> 22:12.830
Where are you now?

22:12.832 --> 22:14.498
I'm still in the perimeter.

22:14.500 --> 22:16.367
I'm going to go after him.

22:16.369 --> 22:17.902
You should wait for backup.
PARKER:
Sam's right.

22:17.904 --> 22:19.437
They're probably already
looking for you.

22:19.439 --> 22:21.072
Just stay out of sight.
We're on our way.

22:21.074 --> 22:23.874
Copy that.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.078
They wouldn't kidnap a cop

22:27.080 --> 22:28.813
unless something serious
was going down.

22:28.815 --> 22:30.882
Okay, Team One, listen up.

22:30.883 --> 22:32.950
We assume that all radio contact
has been compromised.

22:32.952 --> 22:35.019
From here on out,
cell phones only.

22:35.021 --> 22:37.021
Rachel, if I'm going
to have any chance,

22:37.023 --> 22:40.391
stopping Charles from doing
anything stupid, you need

22:40.393 --> 22:41.859
to tell me everything
you know about him.

22:41.861 --> 22:44.862
Like do you have any idea why
he would want to do this?

22:44.864 --> 22:47.865
I heard him saying something
about voices guiding him.

22:47.867 --> 22:48.899
Voices?

22:48.901 --> 22:50.901
What did they tell him?

22:50.903 --> 22:53.571
That death is the only thing
that will keep his people safe.

22:53.573 --> 22:55.639
PARKER:
And how often does he hear them?

22:55.641 --> 22:57.408
RACHEL:
Only one other time
as far as I know.

22:57.410 --> 22:58.909
When Charles was in his 20s,

22:58.911 --> 23:01.912
he-he almost died
of a heroin overdose.

23:01.914 --> 23:05.483
When he came to,
he said the voices saved him.

23:06.819 --> 23:08.953
Told him he needed to get clean,
help others do the same.

23:08.955 --> 23:10.154
So he believes

23:10.156 --> 23:11.889
the only way to do that
is by isolating them

23:11.891 --> 23:13.424
from the outside world?

23:13.426 --> 23:14.925
It wasn't always like that.

23:14.927 --> 23:16.827
People would get clean,
they used to leave.

23:16.829 --> 23:18.062
So what changed?

23:18.064 --> 23:19.614
About seven years ago

23:19.615 --> 23:21.165
he helped a guy named Gary
kick his cocaine habit.

23:21.167 --> 23:25.136
He went home, but after a few
months he started using again.

23:25.138 --> 23:27.938
He died of an overdose.

23:27.940 --> 23:30.941
That's when the fences went up.

23:30.943 --> 23:33.944
Charles was afraid that
if anyone left the Farm,

23:33.946 --> 23:36.947
they would end up like Gary.

23:36.949 --> 23:39.950
He became more
and more paranoid.

23:39.952 --> 23:41.185
Bought guns.

23:41.187 --> 23:43.854
Wouldn't let anyone in or out.

23:43.856 --> 23:47.558
What makes a man like that go
from wanting to keep people safe

23:47.560 --> 23:50.060
to wanting to kill them all?

23:54.534 --> 23:56.600
(liquid pouring)

23:56.602 --> 23:59.470
(sets container on table)
Thank you, James.

24:03.509 --> 24:07.144
And put these, uh,
someplace safe.

24:07.146 --> 24:09.747
Please.

24:09.749 --> 24:11.782
This how you treat

24:11.784 --> 24:13.050
all your guests?

24:18.858 --> 24:20.991
What are you taking,
Charles?

24:20.993 --> 24:23.027
If you're using again,

24:23.029 --> 24:24.795
you can't think
straight.

24:24.797 --> 24:27.631
Are you really

24:27.633 --> 24:29.233
going to kill all these people?

24:32.238 --> 24:34.472
Is that what this is
all about, Charles?

24:34.474 --> 24:35.906
Is that why you're doing this?

24:35.908 --> 24:38.642
I'm doing this
to save my people.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.044
By what, Charles?

24:40.046 --> 24:42.480
By sentencing them
to death?

24:42.482 --> 24:45.483
You're judging something you
couldn't possibly understand.

24:45.485 --> 24:46.784
If you're doing it to save them,
why don't you just tell them,

24:46.786 --> 24:48.686
Charles, why keep it from them?

24:48.688 --> 24:51.339
These people are
like my children.

24:51.340 --> 24:53.991
And children don't always know
what's best for them.

25:08.541 --> 25:12.042
Spike, let's get
Rachel in the truck.

25:12.044 --> 25:15.045
Okay, Rachel, we need you
to draw a map of the Farm--

25:15.047 --> 25:17.548
every way in, how many
buildings there are,

25:17.550 --> 25:19.183
where they're situated, okay?

25:19.185 --> 25:20.885
Okay.
This way, please.

25:20.887 --> 25:22.553
This way right now.
Thank you.

25:24.524 --> 25:27.091
PARKER:
Jules, we're here.

25:27.093 --> 25:29.093
How you doing?

25:29.095 --> 25:30.794
I'm fine.

25:30.796 --> 25:32.129
I've set up a sniper perch

25:32.131 --> 25:33.831
in the center of the compound.

25:33.833 --> 25:35.266
Negative.
Any sign of Eddie?

25:35.268 --> 25:37.668
And Charles must be
getting nervous.

25:37.669 --> 25:40.069
He's got two armed guards
at the main gate.

25:40.072 --> 25:41.205
Copy that.

25:41.207 --> 25:42.606
Keep your eyes open--

25:42.608 --> 25:43.807
anything that might tell us

25:43.809 --> 25:46.110
how he's planning
on killing these people.

25:46.112 --> 25:47.945
I say we take Charles first.

25:47.947 --> 25:49.980
Yeah, cut off the head
of the snake.

25:49.982 --> 25:52.049
Okay, let me try
talking to him first.

25:55.187 --> 25:57.154
ED:
What about Isaac?

25:57.156 --> 25:58.622
Your son,
your own flesh

25:58.624 --> 26:00.024
and blood.

26:00.026 --> 26:02.059
You're telling me you
are willing to kill him, too?

26:02.061 --> 26:05.062
More than anyone.

26:05.064 --> 26:08.132
Isaac needs to take
this journey with me.

26:09.735 --> 26:11.802
(phone rings)

26:14.774 --> 26:17.107
That would be for you.

26:26.218 --> 26:28.085
This is Charles.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.954
Hello, Charles.

26:29.956 --> 26:31.622
My name
is Sergeant Gregory Parker.

26:31.624 --> 26:34.625
I'm with the
Police Strategic Response Unit.

26:34.627 --> 26:37.194
I understand you're holding
one of my colleagues.

26:37.196 --> 26:38.929
Any chance you can tell me
how he's doing?

26:38.931 --> 26:40.164
He's fine.

26:40.166 --> 26:42.099
Oh, thank you very much.
I'm glad to hear that.

26:42.101 --> 26:44.668
I'll let him go if you
let my wife come home.

26:44.670 --> 26:46.170
Well, I'm sorry.

26:46.172 --> 26:47.671
Cannot agree to do that.

26:47.673 --> 26:49.006
Then there's nothing left
to say.

26:49.008 --> 26:50.841
Okay, Charles, hold on.

26:50.843 --> 26:52.843
Help me understand.

26:52.845 --> 26:55.379
You created the Farm to help
people, to save their lives.

26:55.381 --> 26:56.814
So, why are you doing this?

26:56.816 --> 26:58.649
My people need me.
I can't desert them.

26:58.651 --> 26:59.984
Come on, listen to me,
no one has to die today.

26:59.986 --> 27:02.086
It's not too late
to call this thing off.

27:02.088 --> 27:04.321
I wish that were true.

27:22.908 --> 27:25.175
Get the supplies

27:25.177 --> 27:27.244
and gather everyone
into the barn.

27:28.214 --> 27:30.280
It's time.

27:46.432 --> 27:48.732
SPIKE:
You going to keep trying
to talk him down?

27:48.734 --> 27:50.251
I doubt it'll work.

27:50.252 --> 27:51.769
The guy thinks that what
he's doing is necessary.

27:51.771 --> 27:53.437
He's like noble even.

27:53.439 --> 27:55.105
Options, Sam?

27:55.107 --> 27:57.174
Our best point of entry
is right here,

27:57.176 --> 27:59.076
alongside an old delivery road,
that according to Rachel,

27:59.078 --> 28:00.778
not many people know about it.

28:00.780 --> 28:02.780
Coming with us, boss?

28:02.782 --> 28:04.081
Well...

28:04.083 --> 28:06.917
figured need at least
one bald guy in the field.

28:06.919 --> 28:07.918
All right, let's head out.

28:12.792 --> 28:15.426
Isaac, you've got to cut me
loose here, son.

28:15.428 --> 28:17.995
You're not going anywhere till
the cops let my mom come home.

28:17.997 --> 28:19.196
They're not going to let

28:19.198 --> 28:22.132
your mother come back here
to be killed.

28:22.134 --> 28:23.834
Isaac, it's that simple.

28:23.836 --> 28:24.835
What are you talking about?

28:24.837 --> 28:26.136
You don't know

28:26.138 --> 28:27.271
what's going on here, do you?

28:27.273 --> 28:30.040
Okay, Isaac,
listen to me.

28:30.042 --> 28:33.811
Your father plans to kill
everyone on this farm,

28:33.813 --> 28:35.479
including you.

28:35.481 --> 28:37.081
No, no, I don't believe you.

28:37.083 --> 28:38.282
Why do you think
he doesn't want me

28:38.284 --> 28:39.950
looking around, Isaac?

28:39.952 --> 28:41.885
He's hiding something.

28:41.887 --> 28:44.922
No, my father
wouldn't hurt anyone.

28:44.924 --> 28:47.925
Isaac, your mother found out
about it.

28:47.927 --> 28:49.927
That's why she's trying
to get money,

28:49.929 --> 28:51.328
to get you out of here, Isaac.

28:51.330 --> 28:53.363
She's trying to save your life.

28:53.365 --> 28:55.365
No.

28:55.367 --> 28:56.867
My father said

28:56.869 --> 28:58.869
that you'd say anything
to get me to let you go.

28:58.871 --> 29:00.904
I understand that
you love your father.

29:00.906 --> 29:04.208
And you have been raised
to follow him without question,

29:04.210 --> 29:07.044
but there comes a time
in all of our lives,

29:07.046 --> 29:09.813
son, when we have to think
for ourselves.

29:09.815 --> 29:13.183
Now, what your father
is doing is wrong.

29:13.185 --> 29:15.219
Your mother knows that.

29:15.221 --> 29:18.288
Now, if you can help me,
I can stop him.

29:18.290 --> 29:20.324
I can fix it.

29:20.326 --> 29:22.326
Isaac.

29:22.328 --> 29:24.528
Your father needs
to see you.

29:27.933 --> 29:30.000
Come on.

29:31.003 --> 29:34.004
I'll be back for you.

29:34.006 --> 29:36.073
Yeah.

29:50.322 --> 29:52.956
One, two, three.

29:53.926 --> 29:56.827
One, two, three.

29:56.829 --> 29:59.263
One, two, three.

29:59.265 --> 30:00.330
All clear.

30:00.332 --> 30:02.399
All right, let's move.

30:14.346 --> 30:17.080
Sarge, they got Ed
at Charles' house.

30:17.082 --> 30:19.550
It's the first building
northeast of the barn.

30:19.552 --> 30:21.819
PARKER:
Copy, Jules.

30:23.055 --> 30:25.055
What do you want to do?

30:25.057 --> 30:27.024
All right, Wordy, Leah,
you take the main gate.

30:27.026 --> 30:29.092
The rest of us will go after Ed.
WORDY:
Copy.

30:44.076 --> 30:45.342
(grunting)

30:49.849 --> 30:51.949
(grunting)

31:28.487 --> 31:30.921
(grunting)

31:32.458 --> 31:34.992
Boss, we're clear.

31:38.030 --> 31:40.230
This what it takes
to get you out of the truck?

31:40.232 --> 31:41.632
He didn't gag you?

31:42.935 --> 31:44.968
You get Charles?

31:44.970 --> 31:46.270
No, not yet.

31:46.272 --> 31:48.372
He was taking some kind of drug.

31:48.374 --> 31:50.107
Probably hallucinogenics.

31:50.109 --> 31:52.142
Would explain his paranoia
and delusions.

31:53.078 --> 31:55.279
What do you need?

31:55.281 --> 31:58.148
Got your knife?
Yeah, hold up.

32:03.155 --> 32:05.155
Morphine...

32:05.157 --> 32:07.090
Demerol.

32:07.092 --> 32:09.526
Prescription pain killers.

32:09.528 --> 32:12.696
Hey, Winnie, see if you can
get ahold of a Dr. Jane Barkin.

32:12.698 --> 32:15.032
She prescribed some
drugs for Charles

32:15.034 --> 32:16.066
and I want to know why.

32:16.068 --> 32:18.402
And let the team know that, uh,

32:18.404 --> 32:20.103
Eddie's safe
and we're back on com.

32:20.105 --> 32:21.104
Copy that.

32:21.106 --> 32:23.540
You ready?
Lead the way.

32:30.082 --> 32:33.150
All right, inside.

32:33.152 --> 32:35.085
That's it.

32:35.087 --> 32:37.821
We're safer inside.

32:37.822 --> 32:40.556
Sarge, they're ushering
everyone into the main barn.

32:40.559 --> 32:42.259
Do you see any weapons?

32:43.462 --> 32:46.196
They're carrying
three containers.

32:46.198 --> 32:47.364
Can you tell what's in them?

32:49.335 --> 32:52.502
One says chlorine.

32:52.504 --> 32:54.705
The other one says NH...

32:54.707 --> 32:56.340
NH3?

32:56.342 --> 32:57.307
Looks like it.

32:57.309 --> 32:58.375
Ammonia.

32:58.377 --> 32:59.509
They're making poison gas.

32:59.511 --> 33:01.244
Move in now.

33:04.183 --> 33:06.249
Wordy, get need to get a truck
in here, we need gas masks!

33:06.251 --> 33:07.651
Leah, alert DMAT.

33:07.653 --> 33:10.087
On our way.
Copy that.

33:19.565 --> 33:21.665
Dad, what's going on?
It's okay.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.467
Thank you, Leonard.

33:23.469 --> 33:25.068
Isaac, I need you
to go inside now.

33:25.070 --> 33:26.203
Is everyone accounted for?

33:26.205 --> 33:28.672
They're all inside.
Okay.

33:28.674 --> 33:30.574
Please, Isaac,
do as you're told.

33:30.576 --> 33:32.109
It's true, isn't it?

33:32.111 --> 33:33.777
Inside now.

33:33.779 --> 33:35.412
Dad, are you really
gonna kill everybody?

33:35.414 --> 33:37.114
Okay, come here.

33:37.116 --> 33:38.348
I know...

33:38.350 --> 33:42.119
this is hard to understand,
but I am doing this

33:42.121 --> 33:44.221
to protect us.

33:44.223 --> 33:46.123
Haven't I always
taken care of you?

33:46.125 --> 33:47.157
Kept you from harm?
Yes, but...

33:47.159 --> 33:48.358
I'm your father

33:48.360 --> 33:52.262
and I will always do
what is best for you.

33:52.264 --> 33:54.464
Right?

33:54.466 --> 33:56.433
Deep inside your heart,

33:56.435 --> 33:58.535
you know that.

33:58.537 --> 34:01.238
You know it.

34:01.240 --> 34:02.472
Please, Isaac,

34:02.474 --> 34:05.575
I need you to trust me
right now.

34:05.577 --> 34:08.178
Come on, good man.

34:10.315 --> 34:11.648
Go, go!
They're getting closer.

34:11.650 --> 34:13.283
Go, I'll hold them off.

34:14.253 --> 34:15.719
It's okay.

34:15.721 --> 34:17.554
Go.

34:28.167 --> 34:30.467
(gunshot)

34:30.469 --> 34:33.103
Subject down.

34:33.105 --> 34:34.371
(lock clicks)

34:39.311 --> 34:41.178
Charles, what's happening?
Don't be afraid.

34:41.180 --> 34:42.997
Why are you
locking us in?

34:42.998 --> 34:44.815
I promised that I would
keep you safe and I will.

34:44.817 --> 34:46.850
In this life and the next.

34:52.324 --> 34:55.392
(murmuring)

34:55.394 --> 34:57.194
MAN:
What is that stuff?

34:57.196 --> 34:58.595
MAN 2:
Hey, wait a second.

35:00.566 --> 35:02.466
What is that?

35:02.468 --> 35:04.101
LINDA:
Charles, what are you doing?

35:04.103 --> 35:05.235
It's okay!

35:05.237 --> 35:07.270
It's okay.

35:07.272 --> 35:09.306
It's okay.

35:09.308 --> 35:12.676
We'll all be together, forever.
(people coughing)

35:12.678 --> 35:13.677
Let us out.

35:13.679 --> 35:16.146
It's okay, trust me, it's okay.

35:16.148 --> 35:17.347
Let us out!

35:21.787 --> 35:25.522
(panicked shouting)
Let us out!

35:25.524 --> 35:27.457
Door's jammed
from the inside.

35:27.459 --> 35:29.292
Spike, any other way in?
Negative.

35:29.294 --> 35:31.561
Wordy, hurry,
we need the umbrella.

35:31.563 --> 35:33.130
WOMAN:
Please help us!

35:33.132 --> 35:35.265
Let us out of here!

35:35.267 --> 35:38.368
Somebody please,
let us out of here!

35:38.370 --> 35:40.637
(panicked shouting continues)

35:40.639 --> 35:42.539
(shouting)
Open the door!

35:42.541 --> 35:45.308
Somebody help us!

35:45.310 --> 35:47.644
Help us!
Open the door, please!

35:49.348 --> 35:54.151
(panicked shouting)

35:54.153 --> 35:55.352
We gotta get in there.

35:55.354 --> 35:56.820
Everyone inside the barn

35:56.822 --> 35:59.789
stand back from the doors!

35:59.791 --> 36:01.858
Stay back!

36:08.700 --> 36:10.400
Everybody out!

36:10.402 --> 36:12.569
Come on, everyone out!
This way, move it!

36:12.571 --> 36:15.172
Where's Charles, Jules,
can you see him?

36:15.174 --> 36:16.273
No visual.

36:16.275 --> 36:18.175
He must still be
in the building.

36:18.177 --> 36:20.577
Everyone just stay calm.
Move it, let's go!

36:20.579 --> 36:22.546
There, I see him.

36:22.548 --> 36:24.481
Everyone out!
This way!

36:24.483 --> 36:26.516
Everybody out!
Come on, keep moving!

36:26.518 --> 36:28.718
(yells)

36:29.855 --> 36:31.688
Get him out of here!
I'll go after Ed.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.356
Hurry, move it!
Move towards me!

36:35.727 --> 36:37.260
Come on.
(coughing)

36:44.336 --> 36:46.303
WINNIE:
Boss, I just got off
the phone with the doctor.

36:46.305 --> 36:48.205
I think I know why Charles
is doing this.

36:49.975 --> 36:51.975
(Isaac panting)

36:51.977 --> 36:53.910
Dad...

36:53.912 --> 36:55.245
(grunting)

36:55.247 --> 36:56.479
PARKER:
Stop right there!

36:56.481 --> 36:57.714
We'll be together.

36:57.716 --> 36:58.882
I will never leave you.

36:58.884 --> 37:00.650
Dad, please, don't.
Don't come any closer!

37:00.652 --> 37:02.452
Don't!

37:02.454 --> 37:03.453
Jules?

37:03.455 --> 37:04.654
No joy.

37:04.656 --> 37:05.822
Tree's in the way.

37:05.824 --> 37:07.591
Dad, please.

37:07.593 --> 37:09.593
All right, Charles,
just take it easy.

37:09.595 --> 37:11.962
He has to come with me,
it's the only way.

37:11.964 --> 37:14.364
Okay, Charles,
I know you have cancer.

37:14.366 --> 37:16.233
Dad...

37:16.235 --> 37:17.601
Get away from us!
Get away!

37:17.603 --> 37:20.003
Charles, I know you
don't have much time here.

37:20.005 --> 37:22.372
Just get away from us!

37:22.374 --> 37:24.975
Charles, I'm sorry
for what you're going through.

37:24.977 --> 37:28.311
But just because you're dying,
you know, Charles,

37:28.313 --> 37:29.646
doesn't mean
Isaac has to.

37:29.648 --> 37:31.514
What kind of life will he have
without his father?

37:31.516 --> 37:33.617
I promised to take care of him,

37:33.619 --> 37:35.785
to take care
of all these people.

37:35.787 --> 37:37.721
And I understand that,
Charles, I do.

37:37.723 --> 37:41.925
I get it, I know what it's like
to want to protect your family.

37:41.927 --> 37:44.327
To keep them
from making mistakes.

37:44.329 --> 37:45.762
But at a certain point
you have to trust

37:45.764 --> 37:47.731
that you have given them
the tools

37:47.733 --> 37:50.400
to make the right decisions.

37:50.402 --> 37:54.704
Charles, you have saved
a lot of people here.

37:54.706 --> 37:56.740
You saved their lives.

37:56.742 --> 37:59.643
And you've raised
a pretty great kid there.

37:59.645 --> 38:02.312
So, please don't rob him

38:02.314 --> 38:05.682
of the opportunity
to live his life, Charles.

38:06.652 --> 38:08.918
I'm sorry, son.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.720
Dad...
I'm sorry, Isaac,
I'm sorry.

38:10.722 --> 38:12.722
I'm sorry.

38:12.724 --> 38:13.990
I'm so sorry.
Dad...

38:13.992 --> 38:16.293
You can't come with me.

38:24.036 --> 38:26.336
Go on. Go, go, go.

38:26.338 --> 38:27.937
Dad?
Isaac, walk towards us.

38:29.841 --> 38:31.574
I love you, Isaac.

38:31.576 --> 38:34.010
I love you, too.
Isaac, come on.

38:39.985 --> 38:41.418
Charles...

38:43.322 --> 38:44.521
(gunshot)

38:44.523 --> 38:45.655
Dad!

38:45.657 --> 38:47.824
(sobbing):
No!

38:47.826 --> 38:49.859
He's gone, he's gone.

38:49.861 --> 38:52.062
Isaac, he's gone.
I'm sorry.
Dad!

38:52.064 --> 38:53.330
I'm sorry!

38:53.332 --> 38:55.932
There's nothing
you can do.
No!

38:55.934 --> 38:59.769
It's over.
Dad!

39:01.506 --> 39:03.773
I'm sorry.

¶ The calling of stars ¶

40:55.720 --> 40:58.054
I think so.

40:58.056 --> 40:59.722
Got a good head
on his shoulders.

40:59.724 --> 41:02.692
Mm-hmm.

41:11.603 --> 41:13.069
Hey, buddy.

41:13.071 --> 41:15.672
Doing your homework?

41:15.674 --> 41:18.141
You know that party
that you want to go to?

41:18.143 --> 41:21.144
You can go.

41:21.146 --> 41:22.612
Yeah.

41:22.614 --> 41:24.781
Who's gonna be there?

41:24.783 --> 41:27.250
(chuckles):
<i> So, can I go?</i>

41:27.252 --> 41:28.885
<i> I'm kidding.</i>
