00:06.960 --> 00:07.639
Bravo!

00:13.640 --> 00:15.320
Great show.
-Fuck the show.

00:16.079 --> 00:17.960
Stas, what's the score?
-Real's leading.

00:18.359 --> 00:19.160
Shit.

00:19.960 --> 00:21.320
Why won't you present me?
My boyfriend's sitting there.

00:21.440 --> 00:23.480
Who cares, present yourself at home.

00:24.519 --> 00:26.320
Encore, encore.
Let's go, another one.

00:26.440 --> 00:27.640
Come on, get out.

00:27.679 --> 00:30.280
Fine, let's go.

00:30.399 --> 00:32.000
Okay let's do another quick one.

00:33.960 --> 00:35.280
Alma, not with the cell.

00:35.520 --> 00:37.240
Leave the cell!
-Let's go!

00:37.280 --> 00:38.560
I don't want to miss the game.

00:38.640 --> 00:40.159
The wig, Shlomo, your wig.

00:40.520 --> 00:43.000
Easy.
Nice and calm.

00:44.560 --> 00:46.280
Hey, that hurts!
-Sorry.

01:03.960 --> 01:05.319
I'm out of here!

01:05.400 --> 01:07.599
Why can't you
show some generosity?

01:07.680 --> 01:09.640
What's your problem?
Just go like this.

01:09.680 --> 01:10.319
Like this.

01:10.680 --> 01:12.480
Shlomo...
-Anything new in the theater?

01:12.640 --> 01:14.599
A remake of "The Seagull".

01:15.439 --> 01:17.480
Chekhov's "The Seagull"?
-No, Didi Manusi.

01:18.079 --> 01:20.439
Another one, Shlomo!
-Enough already!

01:20.480 --> 01:23.000
But they're still clapping.
-Let them go home already!

01:23.079 --> 01:25.400
"The Seagull"? -Shlomo...
-You knew about this?

01:25.480 --> 01:28.079
What? What?
-You cut off my line.

01:28.120 --> 01:29.599
I'm supposed to bark three times

01:29.680 --> 01:31.680
and you cut in after the second.

01:31.719 --> 01:34.159
The third bark is the punch,
that's when the audience laughs.

01:34.239 --> 01:36.480
Eleanor, I don't care,
leave me alone.

01:36.599 --> 01:38.000
You knew about "The Seagull"?

01:38.319 --> 01:41.239
Yes. -And didn't think to tell me?
-I thought you knew.

01:41.319 --> 01:43.560
What about rehearsals?
-In a month or so.

01:43.640 --> 01:45.400
Who's directing?
-I don't know, I don't...

01:45.480 --> 01:48.480
I heard Vera say it's gonna
be a grand spectacle.

01:48.599 --> 01:51.319
Are the cabs ready?
-Five minutes.

01:51.719 --> 01:53.439
Let's go, last time.

01:53.560 --> 01:55.680
I can't believe you didn't tell me.
-I didn't know.

02:05.640 --> 02:07.680
Look at all that
love from the audience.

02:12.039 --> 02:13.479
Let's go home!

02:45.520 --> 02:47.280
Tzutz.
-What?

02:47.360 --> 02:48.479
Get me the cashews.

02:49.479 --> 02:50.560
You can't get up?

02:50.639 --> 02:52.000
But I'm comfy.

02:53.199 --> 02:54.639
I'm comfy too.

02:55.520 --> 02:57.240
Come on, I'm hungry.

02:57.680 --> 02:59.479
There aren't any cashews.
I finished them yesterday.

02:59.560 --> 03:01.479
So get something else
from the fridge.

03:02.000 --> 03:03.319
There's nothing in the fridge.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.159
Go check.
-I don't have to.

03:06.280 --> 03:07.080
I remember.

03:07.120 --> 03:08.960
You remember everything
that's in the fridge?

03:09.520 --> 03:10.319
Yes.

03:11.080 --> 03:13.080
Batteries, Bengay, ginger.

03:13.159 --> 03:15.280
Bottom shelf, butter.

03:15.360 --> 03:19.000
The one next to it is empty.
In the door: mayo and mayo-lite.

03:19.400 --> 03:20.319
And in the freezer?

03:20.560 --> 03:23.080
Ice.
-Great, wonderful.

03:24.199 --> 03:27.000
If you want, we could make a
mayo-ginger popsicle.

03:27.080 --> 03:28.280
Should we order in?

03:29.080 --> 03:30.680
Got any cash?
The ATM ate my card.

03:30.719 --> 03:32.240
How come, Tzutz?

03:32.319 --> 03:34.400
Because I have too much money.
Why do you think?

03:35.120 --> 03:37.120
I thought maybe you forgot the pin.

03:37.199 --> 03:40.240
I remembered the pin just fine.
I forgot I had no money.

03:43.439 --> 03:44.319
It's you.

03:44.560 --> 03:46.000
So what are we eating?

03:47.120 --> 03:48.280
My father.

03:48.479 --> 03:50.080
How many years will
we eat your father?

03:50.360 --> 03:52.560
At some point we're
gonna have to get off the couch.

03:54.439 --> 03:55.479
Let's hide.

03:55.960 --> 03:56.560
What?

03:56.599 --> 03:57.599
Let's hide.

03:59.680 --> 04:01.479
No one will find us here.
-Right.

04:01.520 --> 04:03.240
And we won't have to do anything...

04:04.159 --> 04:05.000
Excuse me,

04:06.560 --> 04:09.000
I need you for a moment,
it's urgent.

04:09.960 --> 04:11.240
Excuse me.

04:15.039 --> 04:15.680
What do you want?

04:15.960 --> 04:18.160
He doesn't know his lines
and you're letting it slide.

04:18.360 --> 04:20.480
And it's the third time
he didn't present me,

04:20.560 --> 04:22.120
and I always present Shlomo.

04:23.160 --> 04:24.439
We should have done "Autumn".

04:27.439 --> 04:29.279
Are you asking or saying?

04:29.480 --> 04:30.560
I'm saying.

04:31.279 --> 04:32.319
No way.

04:32.959 --> 04:35.120
I think it's really wonderful.

04:36.439 --> 04:37.480
Thanks. -Thank you.

04:42.360 --> 04:44.000
The director said
he should do it.

04:44.079 --> 04:46.319
I didn't make this up.
-What do you want from me?

04:46.360 --> 04:48.000
Tell him to do like this to me too.

04:48.079 --> 04:50.279
Fine, I'll tell him to do it.

04:50.360 --> 04:51.639
Now leave me alone.

04:52.720 --> 04:53.959
Sorry.

04:54.720 --> 04:56.639
Yes.
-We're really...

04:56.720 --> 04:59.480
We have a little...
-Right at the end.

05:00.120 --> 05:01.480
Yes, please.
-OK.

05:03.480 --> 05:05.079
Let's hide.
-What?

05:05.319 --> 05:06.319
Let's hide.

05:07.079 --> 05:11.600
No one will find us here,
and we won't have to do anything, ever.

05:11.720 --> 05:12.720
Great idea.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.680
How long do we hide?
-As long as it takes.

05:16.160 --> 05:20.079
Until they find two skeletons
and our headstones will say:

05:20.240 --> 05:23.160
"Died because they didn't want
to get off the couch."

05:25.519 --> 05:27.319
It's actually romantic.

05:33.120 --> 05:34.000
That's it.

05:37.680 --> 05:39.319
How about we read you another scene?

05:39.360 --> 05:42.560
Five pages are
as good as fifty.

05:42.680 --> 05:45.319
We have the play,
we'll let you know.

05:46.000 --> 05:46.600
Thank you.

05:46.959 --> 05:50.319
Obviously... we're not actors,
actors will...

05:50.399 --> 05:52.279
Certainly.
-Actors will make it come alive,

05:52.360 --> 05:54.680
the material...
-Although the writing speaks for itself.

05:54.959 --> 05:55.480
Yes, absolutely.

05:55.519 --> 05:58.000
Snapshots of a young couple's life.

05:58.079 --> 05:59.959
Funny stuff.
-But not just.

06:00.040 --> 06:02.079
Good.
Listen, our time's up.

06:02.199 --> 06:03.160
Of course. -Got it.

06:03.279 --> 06:05.240
Karina's got your number.
Yes. -Thank you.

06:05.279 --> 06:07.600
Thanks for your time, Vera.

06:09.480 --> 06:10.600
Thanks.

06:18.319 --> 06:20.079
I was crap.
That's why I told her

06:20.120 --> 06:21.480
we aren't actors.

06:22.319 --> 06:24.199
You were fine.
-Really?

06:26.040 --> 06:27.279
Thanks.

06:32.480 --> 06:34.639
You sure we shouldn't
have done "Autumn"?

06:34.680 --> 06:36.040
No way.

06:36.360 --> 06:39.959
No theater will stage
a play about dementia.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.240
You're right.

06:48.639 --> 06:49.959
It's fine.

07:04.040 --> 07:04.639
Tzutz?

07:06.959 --> 07:07.639
Tzutz?

07:08.199 --> 07:09.079
What?

07:11.199 --> 07:12.600
What, "what"?

07:15.079 --> 07:17.120
What's up, sweetie?

07:17.399 --> 07:19.600
Did you just fall asleep?

07:21.000 --> 07:21.639
What?

07:22.079 --> 07:23.279
You heard me.

07:25.079 --> 07:27.279
You think I fell asleep?
What am I, 80?

07:27.319 --> 07:30.120
I don't think.
It's what happened.

07:35.480 --> 07:37.399
I can't believe you fell asleep.

07:37.600 --> 07:39.360
I didn't fall asleep.

07:40.279 --> 07:42.519
I was resting my eyes,
I didn't...

07:42.600 --> 07:44.680
Why? -Why?

07:46.319 --> 07:49.360
Sex, you know...
I closed my eyes to concentrate.

07:49.680 --> 07:52.040
Will you stop making a scene?

07:52.079 --> 07:55.279
Tzutz, you shut your eyes,
stopped talking,

07:55.319 --> 07:56.480
and started breathing
like my grandma.

07:56.639 --> 07:59.399
Being quiet doesn't mean
I'm asleep.

07:59.639 --> 08:02.199
It's only 9 PM.

08:02.279 --> 08:04.480
Fine. Sorry for disturbing you,
go back to sleep.

08:05.079 --> 08:06.600
What a disgusting feeling.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.279
Like screwing a corpse.

08:18.319 --> 08:22.279
Tzutz, I dozed off for a second.
I'm sorry.

08:35.080 --> 08:38.120
Tzutz, I think you're overreacting.

08:38.240 --> 08:39.440
I'm overreacting?

08:41.120 --> 08:43.279
I didn't fall asleep.
I closed my eyes for a second.

08:43.360 --> 08:45.039
So you what? Dozed off?

08:45.279 --> 08:47.279
Just for a second.

08:56.399 --> 08:59.559
I think you're like this because of our
shit meeting at the theater.

08:59.960 --> 09:01.360
Let's drop it.

09:01.480 --> 09:04.080
If the meeting went well
you'd be laughing now.

09:07.600 --> 09:10.080
Obviously. So let's just admit it.

09:10.159 --> 09:11.639
Let's say we had a shitty pitch.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.480
We didn't get it because we blew it,

09:14.639 --> 09:17.360
but it's better to face it
than to make a scene

09:17.440 --> 09:20.600
because I closed my eyes
for a second.

09:20.679 --> 09:23.639
Tzutz, it's even kind of funny.
-I'm trying to watch TV.

09:23.759 --> 09:25.399
So we're watching
TV now?

09:25.480 --> 09:28.200
I am, you do whatever
you want.

09:29.639 --> 09:31.080
Fine.

09:40.279 --> 09:42.080
What's she doing here?

09:45.200 --> 09:46.279
What are you doing here?

09:46.559 --> 09:48.519
You forgot your bible.

09:50.159 --> 09:51.559
She can't be here, bro.

09:51.679 --> 09:55.120
I can't stand her.
Why did she barge in on us?

09:55.200 --> 09:57.279
Return to base.
-I want to be with you,

09:58.120 --> 09:59.639
I'm just as much a soldier as you are.

09:59.759 --> 10:02.759
She always does the same thing.
She's boring.

10:03.039 --> 10:04.519
Obviously you're easily bored.

10:04.639 --> 10:07.480
I dozed off for one second. One second.

10:07.519 --> 10:09.759
It's sheer luck that you
fell asleep and not me,

10:10.000 --> 10:10.600
pure luck.

10:10.679 --> 10:12.879
And you're not as hot
as you think.

10:12.919 --> 10:13.440
I'm not?

10:13.480 --> 10:15.120
Tzutz, I'm a lousy fuck?

10:15.240 --> 10:17.120
Yes. You're lazy and you're too loud.

10:17.679 --> 10:20.639
Meaning what? -You think it's sexy
but it's not, all that screaming.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.279
Great, so we both suffer.

10:24.320 --> 10:26.120
And you're heavy.
-Excuse me?

10:26.200 --> 10:27.399
When you're on top,
you're heavy.

10:27.480 --> 10:29.279
As in heavy vibe?

10:29.279 --> 10:30.960
You know what I meant.
You're heavy.

10:31.080 --> 10:32.279
You're on top and you're heavy.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.639
A certain heaviness.
-That's great, Tzutz.

10:34.679 --> 10:35.600
Yours!

10:37.279 --> 10:39.240
Great.

10:43.120 --> 10:45.279
I think we need
couples' therapy.

10:45.600 --> 10:48.279
What's so funny?
-What's therapy got to do with it?

10:48.360 --> 10:50.559
It helps lots of couples.

10:50.639 --> 10:52.600
It helped Dana and Moshe.

10:52.679 --> 10:54.120
You heard Moshe
talk about Dana?

10:54.200 --> 10:56.200
And that's after therapy?
What was before?

10:56.279 --> 10:57.360
Let's drop it.
Let's not talk.

10:57.440 --> 11:00.480
I'll continue falling asleep
and you'll keep watching TV.

11:00.559 --> 11:02.120
Great.
-We'll just pretend all is well.

11:02.240 --> 11:03.679
Good. -Agreed.

11:04.080 --> 11:05.559
It's a good thing I fell asleep...

11:05.639 --> 11:07.120
Yeah?

11:07.279 --> 11:08.960
Really?
-Maybe now you'll start talking.

11:09.080 --> 11:10.440
You think we need more talking?

11:10.480 --> 11:11.679
We don't talk enough?
-Drop it!

11:11.960 --> 11:14.120
Fine, let's never talk again!

11:18.639 --> 11:19.480
What the fuck?

11:20.159 --> 11:22.279
Son of a bitch...
Who did that?

11:22.480 --> 11:24.240
Kids, who threw the ball?

11:24.279 --> 11:26.120
Why are you out playing
at this hour?

11:26.200 --> 11:28.279
You're kids! Go home!
-Give us our ball back.

11:28.399 --> 11:30.559
Forget the ball! Smart-ass.

11:30.679 --> 11:32.279
Son of a bitch.
-What did you say?

11:32.519 --> 11:33.759
You're the son of a bitch!

11:46.679 --> 11:48.279
I think we should break up.

11:49.440 --> 11:50.080
What?

11:51.399 --> 11:53.360
I mean professionally.

11:53.519 --> 11:55.639
We should seperate
professionally.

11:56.279 --> 11:58.080
We're a couple
and we also work together,

11:58.159 --> 12:00.200
so maybe it's too much.

12:00.279 --> 12:01.279
OK.

12:02.200 --> 12:04.480
You know, I want to be able to

12:04.679 --> 12:07.279
pitch someone else's play,
not just yours.

12:07.399 --> 12:09.960
There are many plays I wanna direct.

12:10.080 --> 12:12.279
I think it'll be good for you too.

12:12.679 --> 12:15.039
Tzutz?
-OK.

12:15.080 --> 12:16.360
Where are you going?

12:16.559 --> 12:18.120
Tzutz?
-Huh?

12:18.279 --> 12:20.440
Where are you going?
-For a walk.

12:20.480 --> 12:21.759
I need some air.
-Wait...

12:22.080 --> 12:24.279
I'll be right back.
I need some air.

12:51.120 --> 12:52.639
What's up?
Tell me,

12:54.679 --> 12:56.759
you're playing Trigorin
in "The Seagull"?

12:57.000 --> 12:58.120
Looks like it.

12:58.279 --> 12:59.519
Lucky you.

13:00.240 --> 13:03.240
"Why do you say that you have
kissed the ground I walked on?"

13:03.519 --> 13:05.080
"I am a seagull."

13:05.200 --> 13:06.960
"No. No, I am an actress."

13:07.080 --> 13:08.240
Maya?

13:08.679 --> 13:12.279
You know I got a scholarship for that
monologue when I was a student.

13:14.320 --> 13:15.639
What do you want, sweetie?

13:16.080 --> 13:17.639
I can't imagine

13:18.039 --> 13:20.279
not getting this part.
I'll die.

13:26.360 --> 13:27.480
I see.

13:28.279 --> 13:30.120
And you want me to talk to
the director

13:30.279 --> 13:32.600
and tell him you
should play Nina?

13:32.679 --> 13:34.120
Only if you really think so.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.480
You look like a Nina.
-Right.

13:37.679 --> 13:39.639
You're hardworking and
you want the part.

13:41.960 --> 13:44.759
Right. -You know he rehearses for
a month and he's gone.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.480
Perfect, he knows what he wants.

13:47.039 --> 13:49.480
And you're aware of
the rumors about him?

13:49.559 --> 13:51.440
The Austrian Gruchvosky...
all kinds of rumors...

13:51.519 --> 13:53.960
That he's a bit off, a total dictator...

13:54.120 --> 13:55.279
I love that.

13:55.639 --> 13:58.120
He told me he wants
all his actors...

13:58.480 --> 14:00.759
to rehearse nude.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.240
Fine... nudity.
Who cares?

14:03.279 --> 14:06.279
Sexuality is part of the play.
-Yes, that's true.

14:06.600 --> 14:08.480
He said that...

14:09.080 --> 14:10.960
Nina and Trigorin
should have sex.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.279
On stage?

14:12.759 --> 14:14.559
No, in real life.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.279
Just once, to bring out
true passion...

14:17.399 --> 14:19.399
He hates fakeness,
he feels it.

14:20.399 --> 14:21.399
Seriously?

14:21.480 --> 14:23.080
Seriously.

14:23.360 --> 14:25.559
That's how he works.
Didn't you know?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.559
We really need to have sex?

14:32.639 --> 14:33.600
That's his method,

14:33.679 --> 14:35.759
but only if it's consensual,

14:36.000 --> 14:37.279
not by force, obviously.

14:41.279 --> 14:42.240
You idiot!

14:42.480 --> 14:43.600
You thought we were gonna have sex?

14:44.279 --> 14:45.399
You're such an idiot.

14:45.480 --> 14:48.039
You'd eat dirt if you had to.
-Go fuck yourself, Shlomo!

14:48.080 --> 14:50.360
Go have kids,
it'll put things in perspective.

14:50.440 --> 14:52.480
Son of a bitch!
-Right.

15:11.759 --> 15:12.440
Yes?

15:13.480 --> 15:15.679
I want to apologize,

15:15.759 --> 15:17.080
I broke your window.

15:18.320 --> 15:20.159
OK. You want the ball back?

15:22.440 --> 15:25.559
But tell your friends
to be careful too, OK?

15:25.679 --> 15:27.399
Stop breathing
like you're in labor.

15:27.960 --> 15:28.559
Silence!

15:28.639 --> 15:30.480
Can I watch "Love Under Fire"?

15:30.559 --> 15:32.600
No, no way.
Take your ball.

15:34.080 --> 15:35.720
Uh... kid,

15:36.320 --> 15:37.759
what's your name?
-Sarah. -Sarah.

15:38.000 --> 15:39.279
It's not a good time, OK?

15:39.279 --> 15:41.080
But I apologized for the window.

15:41.120 --> 15:43.320
I'll ask my mother
to fix it.

15:43.399 --> 15:44.759
Can I watch?
-Listen,

15:45.039 --> 15:47.320
it's not a good time.
-Why do you care?

15:47.679 --> 15:49.279
You know what time it is?

15:50.279 --> 15:51.440
Does your dad know
where you are?

15:51.639 --> 15:53.360
He doesn't live here.

15:53.639 --> 15:55.279
Your mom then.

15:55.360 --> 15:59.000
She's at work and
I don't like being home alone.

16:00.559 --> 16:03.080
Where do you live?
-Here.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.279
Here where?

16:04.480 --> 16:06.080
Across the hall.

16:06.120 --> 16:07.720
You've never seen me?

16:07.960 --> 16:11.480
You have a Hyundai i25,
your wife has curly hair.

16:11.559 --> 16:12.720
Iris, right?

16:13.000 --> 16:16.240
You're always rushing
and you don't have kids. Right?

16:16.480 --> 16:18.399
Tomer, right?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.759
Got any fruit?

16:32.360 --> 16:35.279
We're stuck.
Our relationship is stuck.

16:36.279 --> 16:39.240
For me, it's all or nothing.

16:40.600 --> 16:42.559
So if you're not totally in it,

16:42.639 --> 16:44.240
I'm leaving.

17:00.559 --> 17:02.279
"The Seagull" is...

17:03.639 --> 17:05.279
How shall I put it?

17:06.000 --> 17:08.559
Nina in Chekhov's "The Seagull,"

17:09.480 --> 17:11.720
it's a fucking...

17:12.759 --> 17:16.079
It's the role of a lifetime.
It's 'IT'.

17:16.279 --> 17:19.000
Got it.
Let's make a toast.

17:19.079 --> 17:20.279
That's what we're here for.

17:20.359 --> 17:23.039
The most eligible bachelor
is finally caught.

17:23.160 --> 17:25.039
Do you know how many actresses

17:25.079 --> 17:26.519
have played Nina
so far in Israel?

17:26.599 --> 17:28.079
Four. That's all.

17:28.200 --> 17:30.079
Her lines are like... wow...

17:30.200 --> 17:33.039
We may need to
put off the wedding a bit.

17:33.079 --> 17:34.359
It depends on rehearsals.

17:34.519 --> 17:37.079
But not by much.
-Fine babe, we'll see.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.240
Excuse me, Maya?

17:38.680 --> 17:39.759
You're wonderful.

17:40.680 --> 17:42.680
We didn't like the play but...

17:42.759 --> 17:45.200
you were simply wonderful.
Wasn't she, Benny?

17:46.480 --> 17:48.559
You remember me, right?

17:49.559 --> 17:50.519
Remind me.

17:50.599 --> 17:51.599
Relly Binder.

17:52.079 --> 17:54.279
Chairperson of the Friends of
the Theatre.

17:54.599 --> 17:56.559
We've been following
your career.

17:56.720 --> 17:59.680
And you just keep getting better.

18:00.039 --> 18:02.480
Outstanding.
Both here and on television.

18:02.920 --> 18:03.440
Thanks.

18:03.440 --> 18:07.079
Ask Benny, he's a real critic.

18:07.279 --> 18:09.759
He doesn't like anything.

18:11.160 --> 18:12.240
Thank you.

18:12.480 --> 18:15.319
I wish you lots of luck.
-Bye, enjoy.

18:15.400 --> 18:16.680
Thanks.

18:24.200 --> 18:26.160
What's "getting better"?
Who is she, my teacher?

18:26.240 --> 18:27.759
She meant to praise you.
-She wanted to live through me.

18:28.039 --> 18:29.599
"Getting better," like it's an audition?

18:29.759 --> 18:32.000
She meant well.
-No, no, no.

18:32.079 --> 18:34.079
Either say you like me or
keep quiet.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.079
Why compare?

18:36.279 --> 18:40.079
Performing is so revealing, yet so intimate.

18:40.200 --> 18:42.480
I bare my soul and try
to leave a piece of it behind.

18:42.559 --> 18:46.200
Wow. -Yes, I bust my ass
on stage night after night.

18:46.279 --> 18:48.440
Imagine, Avivit,
I come to your office

18:48.480 --> 18:49.519
and say in front of everybody:

18:49.599 --> 18:51.160
"You're getting better, Avivit"

18:51.279 --> 18:52.559
I don't remember what you do,

18:52.640 --> 18:54.319
but I don't think just anyone can come

18:54.400 --> 18:55.680
and criticize your work.

18:55.759 --> 18:57.599
Shut the fuck up already.
-What?

19:00.440 --> 19:01.759
What? No...

19:02.359 --> 19:05.279
No, it's fine, just relax a bit.
Everything's OK.

19:06.279 --> 19:08.440
It's OK, let's move on.

19:08.759 --> 19:10.039
Everything's fine.

19:13.599 --> 19:14.720
What?

19:15.720 --> 19:16.759
What?

19:18.279 --> 19:20.079
No, sorry bro, it's just...

19:20.200 --> 19:22.440
It would be great if you could talk less

19:22.480 --> 19:23.480
so others can get a word in.

19:23.599 --> 19:25.279
We had a shitty day too,
you know...

19:25.359 --> 19:27.240
We didn't wake up just
to come see your play.

19:27.279 --> 19:28.440
Yuvi
-I get it.

19:28.519 --> 19:30.279
I don't think you do,
but okay.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.440
I was at work today too, you know.

19:36.519 --> 19:38.279
So was Avivit.
-Chill.

19:38.279 --> 19:41.000
I'm perfectly calm,
we're good.

19:41.279 --> 19:43.079
Then we had to babysit my nephews

19:43.119 --> 19:44.440
because my sister
got divorced this week.

19:44.519 --> 19:46.759
But I didn't dump my shit on you

19:47.000 --> 19:48.279
because you don't care,
and rightly so.

19:48.359 --> 19:49.480
We took a shower and came.

19:49.559 --> 19:51.759
Although we wanted
to miss the boring play...

19:52.000 --> 19:53.079
Wow. Great. Thanks.

19:53.160 --> 19:55.240
No, you were really good

19:55.279 --> 19:57.279
but the play was boring.

19:57.279 --> 19:59.319
I almost fell asleep,
but we came anyway.

19:59.400 --> 20:02.319
Why? Because I promised Reut
and that's what friends do.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.079
Even though, last time we met,

20:04.200 --> 20:07.079
you couldn't stop talking
about yourself either.

20:07.200 --> 20:09.480
It's okay, Yuvi, enough.
-It's not okay.

20:09.559 --> 20:10.759
Enough, come on!

20:11.000 --> 20:12.400
It's not OK!

20:12.519 --> 20:14.079
You're told you're good,
you don't like it.

20:14.200 --> 20:15.440
You're told you're great,
you still don't like it.

20:15.519 --> 20:17.079
What do I care

20:17.240 --> 20:19.160
about Shelly Spiegler
who fucked up your day?

20:19.240 --> 20:21.319
Honestly, I don't care about this stuff,

20:21.400 --> 20:24.279
I don't know Chekhov from Adam,
I don't know Nina.

20:24.359 --> 20:25.279
Nobody cares.

20:25.359 --> 20:27.039
Does anybody care about Nina?

20:27.119 --> 20:28.440
Reut, do you care?
-The play was amazing.

20:28.519 --> 20:30.680
Seriously? You liked it?
-Stop.

20:31.279 --> 20:32.279
Fine. Fine.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.480
I'm so sorry, he gets
nasty when he drinks.

20:38.640 --> 20:40.599
It's fine.
-I haven't had a drink yet.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.079
Where's the damn waitress?

20:44.119 --> 20:46.240
Fucking Tel Aviv...

20:47.400 --> 20:49.079
Let's order already.

20:52.039 --> 20:55.160
Ouch, it hurts.
It hurts.

20:55.279 --> 20:56.599
It looks bad.

20:58.039 --> 21:00.359
Forget it Ron,
I don't want to ruin your good record.

21:01.079 --> 21:02.480
There's more to life than a record.

21:11.279 --> 21:12.680
Where were you?
You didn't answer.

21:12.960 --> 21:14.079
Hi Iris.

21:15.519 --> 21:17.279
Who's she?
-She wanted to watch TV.

21:17.279 --> 21:19.279
Her name's Sarah and she lives
over there. Where were you?

21:19.279 --> 21:21.279
What did she want?
-She wanted to watch "Love Under Fire"

21:21.319 --> 21:23.039
and I don't know what to do
with her. OK?

21:24.119 --> 21:27.759
Sweetie, hi, what's your name?
-Sarah.

21:28.279 --> 21:31.559
Sarah, this isn't a good time,
you need to go home.

21:31.680 --> 21:33.279
-A little longer, the
episode's almost over.

21:33.359 --> 21:34.519
Please, please, please.

21:37.079 --> 21:38.720
Does her mother know she's here?
-Yes.

21:39.440 --> 21:40.559
Come.

21:51.279 --> 21:53.400
I want each of us to say what we want
from this relationship.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.440
I already did.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.039
You didn't. You said you
don't want us to work together.

21:57.359 --> 21:59.000
What else do I need to say?
-Everything.

21:59.079 --> 22:01.039
You make faces and
I have to figure them out.

22:01.079 --> 22:02.359
So I say, "let's talk,"
you say "no".

22:02.440 --> 22:03.400
"You're pissed"? Silence.

22:03.480 --> 22:05.079
"Let's go to therapy?"
That's a no, too.

22:09.039 --> 22:12.240
If you have something to say,
just say it.

22:12.480 --> 22:15.400
I'd really like you
to go first for once.

22:15.480 --> 22:17.440
Are you kidding?
We're taking turns now?

22:17.519 --> 22:20.240
Yeah, Tzutz, we're taking turns.
-I don't know what you want.

22:20.519 --> 22:22.440
You do, you're just being a coward.

22:22.480 --> 22:24.079
Give me a break,
I've been pretty brave today.

22:24.200 --> 22:26.480
Good, keep it up.

22:28.079 --> 22:29.480
Maybe I need to be
brave too,

22:29.559 --> 22:32.279
and tell you what it is
I want from you.

22:33.039 --> 22:35.319
Now's a good time to answer?

22:35.400 --> 22:37.160
Alright, I won't.

22:37.440 --> 22:39.000
You want us to say it together?

22:40.240 --> 22:41.599
Say what together?

22:41.680 --> 22:44.000
Everything we want
from each other.

22:44.079 --> 22:45.440
You're driving me nuts.

22:45.480 --> 22:46.680
We've been together for five years.

22:46.759 --> 22:49.200
Tell me what you want
out of this relationship.

22:49.279 --> 22:50.079
I'm going to say it.

22:50.200 --> 22:52.319
I'm gonna count to three,
and then I'm saying it. You also say it.

22:53.279 --> 22:55.759
Ready? -OK.
-OK? -Fine.

22:57.559 --> 22:58.599
OK.

22:59.720 --> 23:01.680
You too.
-Fine.

23:03.279 --> 23:05.279
Not more than four words,
keep it simple.

23:05.279 --> 23:07.279
There's a word limit now?
-Yes.

23:07.480 --> 23:09.000
OK. -Ready?

23:10.160 --> 23:11.079
Yes.

23:13.359 --> 23:14.599
Three, two, one...

23:14.720 --> 23:16.680
I want a baby.
-I want to break up.

23:22.559 --> 23:24.279
Good, great.

23:24.960 --> 23:26.480
Nice game.

23:28.960 --> 23:30.079
Sarah,

23:30.599 --> 23:32.240
I'm sorry, it's a bad time.

23:32.319 --> 23:33.359
It's almost over.

23:33.480 --> 23:35.240
Please go home.

23:35.960 --> 23:39.000
She won't stay at the front,
she'll return to base...

23:39.519 --> 23:42.160
Ron will follow her
and he'll get shot in the leg.

23:42.279 --> 23:44.480
You spoiled it!
Who shot him?

23:44.559 --> 23:47.240
The bad guys.
-They don't see themselves as bad.

23:47.279 --> 23:48.519
Fine. Good night.

23:58.119 --> 23:59.440
I need to throw up.

24:06.440 --> 24:07.480
Tzutz?

24:11.359 --> 24:13.079
Should I bring you water?

24:19.599 --> 24:22.559
You don't need to throw up.
OK?

24:22.720 --> 24:25.400
Listen to me, Tzutz,

24:26.400 --> 24:28.359
I need to think a little.

24:30.039 --> 24:32.279
Don't force it.
You're forcing it.

24:32.359 --> 24:35.079
I'm not forcing it.
I need to throw up.

24:40.440 --> 24:42.079
No you don't.

24:42.240 --> 24:44.440
I think I'm gonna go for a bit, OK?

24:47.079 --> 24:49.759
Stop it, you're forcing yourself.
Stop already!

24:50.160 --> 24:52.079
Listen to me. We'll....

24:55.279 --> 24:56.319
It'll be okay.

24:56.400 --> 25:00.079
I think it'll be fine
and you'll be strong.

25:01.079 --> 25:03.200
You're the strongest woman I know.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.480
Don't force it! You'll destroy your throat.

25:06.559 --> 25:09.160
Listen, I need some air,

25:09.279 --> 25:11.400
I need to clear my head
and figure out

25:11.480 --> 25:13.720
who I am without you.
OK?

25:14.000 --> 25:17.079
Don't cry please.
There's some water here.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.000
OK?

25:19.079 --> 25:20.440
There's water here for you.

25:20.480 --> 25:23.279
It's next to your Xanax.

25:23.359 --> 25:25.759
And you have your phone here
if you need...

25:26.000 --> 25:27.440
Enough.
Enough.

25:27.519 --> 25:29.759
Call me if you need
anything, alright?

25:30.000 --> 25:32.279
If something actually bad
happens call and I'll come.

25:32.279 --> 25:33.519
Everything will be fine.

25:33.599 --> 25:35.160
Everything will be fine.

25:36.599 --> 25:38.240
Tzutz?

25:39.119 --> 25:40.720
We'll be fine, Tzutz.

25:59.039 --> 26:03.680
"Loved your play! Call us
so we can proceed."

26:51.680 --> 26:54.200
I told you to go home, kids,
it's late.

26:54.279 --> 26:56.279
Beat it.
-You again?

26:56.359 --> 26:58.279
Fuck off, asshole!

27:12.480 --> 27:13.359
What?

27:15.279 --> 27:18.039
What just happened?

27:19.519 --> 27:23.440
I think we went crazy
for a second.

27:31.640 --> 27:33.400
I think we need

27:33.480 --> 27:35.279
little fights every now and then

27:35.279 --> 27:37.519
to avoid a huge one like this.

27:42.680 --> 27:44.039
Come.

28:08.200 --> 28:09.359
Did you throw up?

28:31.200 --> 28:33.480
See what happens when I talk?
I say nonsense.

28:35.440 --> 28:36.759
Who needs it?

28:42.240 --> 28:43.480
You should do the talking

28:43.559 --> 28:45.720
in our relationship.
I should stay quiet.

28:47.200 --> 28:49.519
You don't change horses
when you're winning.

28:54.480 --> 28:55.599
See?

28:55.720 --> 28:57.440
I open my mouth and
what comes out? A horse.

28:57.519 --> 28:59.240
What came out? A horse.

29:07.359 --> 29:09.279
But, you know,

29:10.640 --> 29:13.599
a thoroughbred.

29:14.759 --> 29:16.519
An Arabian horse.

29:23.319 --> 29:24.319
Sorry.

29:25.960 --> 29:26.759
Sorry.

29:31.680 --> 29:33.000
I have a surprise for you.

29:33.079 --> 29:34.440
I don't want a surprise.

29:37.119 --> 29:39.279
What's your biggest wish right now?

29:39.559 --> 29:41.079
Dumpling soup.

29:45.240 --> 29:46.279
OK.

29:48.319 --> 29:51.279
The theatre wants your play.

29:54.480 --> 29:55.279
What?

29:56.319 --> 29:58.240
They texted me.

29:59.119 --> 30:00.079
Show me.

30:12.559 --> 30:14.200
Shit...

30:23.160 --> 30:25.279
Wow.
-Congrats.

30:26.279 --> 30:27.519
Congrats.

30:28.119 --> 30:29.279
Like we imagined.

30:29.640 --> 30:30.720
Exactly.

30:53.279 --> 30:55.200
When did you see the message?

30:57.079 --> 30:58.039
What?

31:09.720 --> 31:10.720
What?

31:19.480 --> 31:21.079
Get out.

31:25.079 --> 31:26.440
Get out.
