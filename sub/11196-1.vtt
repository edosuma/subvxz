00:05.923 --> 00:08.675
Previously on "Stargate SG-1":

00:08.759 --> 00:12.137
- This is the sun that Vorash is orbiting.
- We wanna blow it up.

00:19.061 --> 00:22.147
- What the hell was that?
- We're under attack.

00:23.190 --> 00:26.193
Hyperdrive is down. We're sitting ducks.

00:28.362 --> 00:31.281
We must not
allow Tanith to escape.

00:34.493 --> 00:36.745
Teal'c, pull up!

00:37.788 --> 00:39.498
Mayday, mayday!

00:39.623 --> 00:42.793
- We are so goin' in!
- Jack, can you hear me?

00:50.592 --> 00:52.845
So? Now what?

00:54.000 --> 01:00.074

01:02.604 --> 01:05.107
Four minutes before the sun
begins to supernova.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.609
Daniel, just get me the hell outta here!

01:13.907 --> 01:16.743
Engaging hyperdrive.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.083
Sir. Where's Teal'c?

01:23.417 --> 01:24.418
I think he's dead.

01:24.543 --> 01:27.296
We've travelled
over four million light years.

01:27.379 --> 01:31.091
- That's impossible.
- It's gonna take us 125 years to get back.

01:35.262 --> 01:36.305
It's Apophis.

01:49.818 --> 01:51.612
And now, the conclusion.

01:51.695 --> 01:54.198
- He's arming weapons.
- Shields?

01:55.699 --> 01:58.869
Not responding. Not that
they'd do much good anyway.

01:58.994 --> 02:02.789
That ship has weapons powerful enough
to penetrate shields at full power.

02:02.915 --> 02:04.791
Hyperdrive?

02:04.875 --> 02:08.669
Not responding. The blast wave that
propelled us here did some damage.

02:08.794 --> 02:11.465
Can we communicate with them?

02:11.548 --> 02:14.551
- And say what?
- I don't know. "Don't shoot"?

02:18.138 --> 02:20.182
Kree, Lord Apophis.

02:20.307 --> 02:24.102
I am Selmak of the Tok'ra,
commander of this ship.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.231
"Commander"?

02:28.106 --> 02:30.609
You wanna bicker about rank now?

02:33.111 --> 02:35.239
Onak rak, shel Apophis!

02:36.240 --> 02:39.993
- He's looking a little pissed.
- We did just destroy his fleet.

02:40.285 --> 02:44.998
Rak lo najaquna, shel re hara kek!

02:45.249 --> 02:47.125
He says it's time for us to die.

02:47.251 --> 02:51.964
Wait. I don't know if you checked your
dashboard, but we're both way off course.

02:52.297 --> 02:55.467
Harek rel kree lo mak!

02:55.676 --> 02:57.636
He's saying he knows everything.

02:57.761 --> 02:59.847
Onak rak shel na!

02:59.972 --> 03:03.225
He's also saying
there's nothing we can do to help him.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.352
He's going to destroy us.

03:05.477 --> 03:08.313
- We surrender.
- What? Daniel?

03:09.147 --> 03:11.817
He'll blow us to pieces.
I'm trying to buy time.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.570
Kla mel ha rak.

03:16.780 --> 03:18.740
What'd he say?

03:18.866 --> 03:21.118
"Too late. "

04:34.274 --> 04:37.361
I can't stand it. What's he waitin' for?

04:48.664 --> 04:52.876
- What happened?
- I'm picking up another ship on sensors.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.504
It's coming in fast.

04:56.505 --> 04:59.007
They're firing on Apophis.

04:59.716 --> 05:03.762
- What are you doing?
- Getting the hell outta here.

05:12.563 --> 05:15.566
That ship is unlike anything
in the computer records.

05:15.691 --> 05:18.151
We are in an uncharted part
of the universe.

05:18.443 --> 05:23.198
I'm enjoying their style -
shoot first, send flowers later.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.576
- Works.
- But it only fired at Apophis.

05:25.701 --> 05:28.161
Well, his ship's a much bigger threat.

05:28.287 --> 05:31.039
- Think they were trying to save us?
- It's possible.

05:31.123 --> 05:34.459
We may still find out. We won't
get far on sublight engines.

05:34.585 --> 05:38.297
And whoever wins the fight
will probably come looking for us.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.928
- Now what are you doing?
- This system is centred on a blue giant.

05:45.053 --> 05:48.223
If we can move close enough
to the coronasphere,

05:48.348 --> 05:50.809
the radiation should
keep us off their sensors.

05:50.934 --> 05:53.145
Excuse me? Radiation?

05:54.146 --> 05:57.399
Well, the ship's hull will protect us.

05:57.774 --> 06:00.194
For a while.

06:08.118 --> 06:10.537
We're entering the coronasphere.

06:11.580 --> 06:15.167
The good news is that we won't show up
on anyone else's sensors.

06:15.292 --> 06:17.961
The bad news is
our sensors will be blocked as well.

06:18.045 --> 06:22.591
So when we're ready to go, we won't
know if someone's waiting for us.

06:23.926 --> 06:27.262
- How long do we have?
- About an hour without full shields.

06:27.554 --> 06:29.181
Ten hours with them.

06:29.640 --> 06:32.309
Sam, you wanna give me a hand?

06:34.853 --> 06:38.273
- I'd fix the shields first.
- Right, Jack.

06:39.942 --> 06:41.985
Just a suggestion.

06:50.702 --> 06:53.789
- Are you OK?
- Just thinking about Teal'c.

06:57.334 --> 06:59.378
Five minutes.

06:59.503 --> 07:02.589
And nine hours.
The shields are back on line.

07:12.391 --> 07:14.434
- Oh, boy.
- How bad is it?

07:14.560 --> 07:18.605
It's bad. The hyperdrive control crystals
are all completely shot.

07:19.857 --> 07:22.317
We already used the backups.

07:28.991 --> 07:33.203
I don't suppose you wanna...
talk about what happened on Vorash?

07:38.083 --> 07:40.377
Not really.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.754
Didn't think so.

07:46.258 --> 07:49.011
We were ambushed at the rings.

07:50.095 --> 07:52.556
Teal'c took one in the back.

07:54.516 --> 07:56.977
I should have seen it comin'.

07:59.646 --> 08:04.818
I thought the key to a good ambush was
to make sure that you don't see it comin'.

08:09.031 --> 08:12.743
My point is that I'm...
I'm sure that you did your best.

08:16.205 --> 08:18.665
Apparently it wasn't good enough.

08:36.058 --> 08:39.144
- Receiving Tok'ra IDC, sir.
- Open the iris.

08:46.818 --> 08:49.112
Stand down.

08:49.780 --> 08:52.783
Welcome to Earth. I'm General Hammond.

08:52.866 --> 08:55.953
I am Councilwoman Ren'al of the Tok'ra.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.497
Would you please come this way?

09:00.207 --> 09:02.584
- I assume you have news.
- Yes.

09:05.295 --> 09:09.341
We had two scout ships as close
to the region as safety permitted.

09:09.466 --> 09:13.595
Sensors confirmed the star
did go supernova as planned.

09:13.720 --> 09:19.393
As far as we can tell, Apophis' fleet
was in close proximity as it happened.

09:19.476 --> 09:21.770
As far as you can tell?

09:22.437 --> 09:25.983
Our data only covers
the time prior to the blast wave.

09:26.108 --> 09:30.571
An energy burst of that magnitude
blacks out sensor readings for some time.

09:30.696 --> 09:35.409
However, I can assure you there's no way
for a mothership to have survived.

09:35.868 --> 09:38.620
And there's been
no communication from SG-1?

09:38.704 --> 09:40.581
No.

09:40.664 --> 09:43.834
A one- man pod was launched
from Apophis' mothership

09:43.917 --> 09:46.378
- minutes prior to the explosion.
- Apophis?

09:46.503 --> 09:50.215
It is possible. But that would mean
he had anticipated the explosion,

09:50.340 --> 09:53.260
- and his fleet should have escaped.
- Then who was it?

09:53.719 --> 09:58.098
We tracked the pod into Goa'uld- occupied
territory, but could not follow further.

09:58.223 --> 10:02.519
There was one, possibly two subspace
distortions during the explosion

10:02.603 --> 10:06.815
that could be explained by ships
attempting to enter hyperspace.

10:06.899 --> 10:12.404
However, we're fairly confident they did
not make it out prior to the blast wave.

10:12.487 --> 10:17.451
- So you're saying SG-1 did not survive?
- The possibility is extremely remote.

10:18.410 --> 10:22.039
If they had, they should
have contacted us by now.

10:22.164 --> 10:25.751
You can rest assured,
whether or not SG-1 survived,

10:25.876 --> 10:28.962
their action has thrown
the Goa'uld into chaos.

10:29.087 --> 10:31.215
The resultant void in dominant power

10:31.340 --> 10:36.762
will have the remaining System Lords
fighting each other for years to come.

10:36.887 --> 10:38.847
Thank you.

10:42.518 --> 10:47.064
The Tok'ra are officially considering
Selmak a fallen war hero.

10:47.147 --> 10:50.484
You'll forgive me for
holding out hope a little longer.

10:50.567 --> 10:54.613
SG-1 has a surprisingly
good habit of beating the odds.

11:09.962 --> 11:12.256
This is not gonna work.

11:12.381 --> 11:15.551
Hey, it's gettin'
a little hot up here, kids.

11:15.634 --> 11:17.177
We're running out of time.

11:21.515 --> 11:26.395
- The hyperdrive is history.
- Retrofitting other crystals didn't work.

11:26.520 --> 11:29.773
But it'd take 100 years to get home
even with the hyperdrive.

11:29.857 --> 11:32.776
- Yeah.
- So, long term, what's the difference?

11:32.860 --> 11:36.905
Well, in the short term, it'll be
hard to avoid enemy ships.

11:36.989 --> 11:40.075
- Weapons and shields?
- Good for now.

11:40.200 --> 11:43.871
- Good enough to cover our butts?
- We'll see.

11:44.746 --> 11:47.124
Moving out of the coronasphere.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.669
The sensors are coming back on line.

11:51.712 --> 11:54.173
I'm picking up one ship.

11:56.675 --> 11:59.428
- It's Apophis.
- What about the other one?

12:00.512 --> 12:03.932
- It's not out there.
- Can Apophis see us yet?

12:04.057 --> 12:06.393
He should be able to, but he's not moving.

12:06.518 --> 12:09.438
Maybe his ship
was damaged in the battle.

12:11.315 --> 12:12.858
That's impossible.

12:14.568 --> 12:19.031
- Care to share?
- It says there's no life signs on board.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.755
What if the other ship
comes back while we're there?

12:34.838 --> 12:37.299
We're sitting ducks
no matter where we are.

12:37.424 --> 12:40.344
If Apophis' ship is damaged
and we can repair it, we should.

12:40.427 --> 12:44.181
It's faster, has more advanced weaponry,
and superior shields.

12:44.306 --> 12:47.976
- It still got its fanny whupped.
- We won't know why until we get there.

12:48.101 --> 12:52.022
At the very least, we need
hyperdrive control crystals.

13:03.617 --> 13:07.579
Kree, arak ushtrak.
Oona karak.

13:07.704 --> 13:11.083
Kree, arak ushtrak. Oona karak.

13:11.208 --> 13:15.087
- What's he saying?
- The self- destruct is set.

13:15.212 --> 13:18.799
We have four minutes. I'll try
and shut it off from the peltak.

13:18.924 --> 13:22.761
- Sam, you know where the crystals are?
- We'll get'em.

13:28.267 --> 13:30.310
This way, sir. It's not far.

13:30.435 --> 13:33.355
Carter, how do you know
where to go in a place like this?

13:33.480 --> 13:37.442
I studied the Tok'ra specs of this ship
while we were on Vorash.

13:37.568 --> 13:41.405
- You know how to have a good time.
- I'm havin' a good time now, sir.

13:41.530 --> 13:43.782
You go, girl.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.717
Clear.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.137
Eeuw.

14:11.101 --> 14:13.937
- What was it?
- I don't know.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.899
But it sounds eerily familiar.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.659
Jacob, do you read?

14:27.784 --> 14:31.205
- Yeah.
- Uh, we should get outta here.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.249
Yeah, I figured that.

14:42.424 --> 14:46.553
- Guys, what's goin' on?
- It's crawling with replicators.

14:46.678 --> 14:49.515
Sam, I can't
shut down the auto- destruct.

14:49.640 --> 14:53.060
- I'll meet you in the ring room.
- We'll try to get the crystals.

14:53.185 --> 14:54.811
You have three minutes.

14:54.895 --> 14:58.732
Daniel, you'll have to fly that ship
as soon as we ring back aboard.

14:58.857 --> 15:01.610
And you'll have to tell me how to do that.

15:07.824 --> 15:09.910
Sam, Jack. One minute.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.955
Sam! Jack! Do you read?

15:15.165 --> 15:17.417
Activate the rings!

15:33.141 --> 15:35.602
- We got'em.
- Go, Daniel!

15:45.737 --> 15:47.739
No time to fix the hyperdrive.

15:47.865 --> 15:50.784
Let's hope the sublight engines
get us far enough away.

15:50.868 --> 15:53.954
It won't matter if the replicators
stop the auto- destruct.

15:54.037 --> 15:57.666
They'd have to learn to reprogram
a Goa'uld computer awfully quick.

15:57.791 --> 16:01.753
- If they get control of that ship...
- Hey! You guys are being too negative!

16:01.879 --> 16:05.299
- We're not gonna make it!
- We're going as fast as we can.

16:09.052 --> 16:11.430
Shut down engines!
Divert power to the shields!

16:11.555 --> 16:13.348
Be my guest.

16:23.692 --> 16:26.028
That was close.

16:28.322 --> 16:32.201
I believe someone said
"We're not gonna make it. "

16:32.868 --> 16:35.245
Sam, let's get the hyperdrive running.

16:35.370 --> 16:37.331
Excuse me.

16:37.414 --> 16:40.417
I distinctly remember someone saying

16:40.542 --> 16:43.003
"We're not gonna make it!"

16:43.879 --> 16:46.215
- I think we made it.
- I'm sorry.

16:46.340 --> 16:49.801
I overreacted. It looked very much
like we weren't going to make it.

16:50.052 --> 16:53.805
Yes, well, maybe next time
you'll just wait and see.

16:54.014 --> 16:57.809
And blow the last chance
I might ever have to be right?

17:01.355 --> 17:02.356
What?

17:03.315 --> 17:05.776
Welcome to my life.

17:07.194 --> 17:09.238
What?

17:21.583 --> 17:23.669
We're good to go.

17:23.794 --> 17:27.256
Engine room, this is peltak.
Come in immediately.

17:27.381 --> 17:30.843
- We've left him in charge once too often.
- What is it, Daniel?

17:31.260 --> 17:33.762
I'm picking up a ship on the sensors.

17:34.638 --> 17:36.723
Now what?

17:43.272 --> 17:46.775
Someone must have escaped
Apophis' ship before the bugs took over.

17:46.900 --> 17:49.820
- Who?
- It's a Goa'uld cargo ship.

17:50.487 --> 17:53.240
I'm sending a hailing signal.

17:56.160 --> 17:58.120
Nothing.

17:58.203 --> 18:01.623
I am Selmak of the Tok'ra,
commander of this ship.

18:01.748 --> 18:05.627
You know, we really should talk
about this "commander" thing.

18:05.752 --> 18:08.213
Identify yourself.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.429
- Teal'c!
- O'Neill.

18:15.888 --> 18:19.933
- You made it!
- Apophis revived me in his sarcophagus.

18:21.018 --> 18:24.563
We fled his ship
when the replicators attacked.

18:24.688 --> 18:28.317
- "We"?
- There are other life signs on the ship.

18:29.234 --> 18:31.528
Who ya got with ya, Teal'c?

18:31.653 --> 18:36.408
A few Jaffa who supported our cause.
They helped me escape.

18:40.996 --> 18:43.832
Opening the cargo bay doors.

18:43.916 --> 18:47.085
- Welcome back.
- Thank you, O'Neill.

19:03.644 --> 19:05.687
Hey!

19:08.982 --> 19:10.025
Buddy!

19:15.656 --> 19:18.116
What ya got goin' here, Teal'c?

19:19.910 --> 19:21.954
Well done, Teal'c.

19:22.079 --> 19:26.708
Finally you have resumed
your rightful position as my first prime.

19:45.310 --> 19:48.856
All right, this is feeling
like a strange plan,

19:48.981 --> 19:52.943
but just let me know what to do
and when.

20:01.160 --> 20:05.998
Come on, Teal'c. You don't really think
that you're still first prime of Apophis?

20:06.290 --> 20:09.877
I have never ceased
to be in the service of my god.

20:10.002 --> 20:13.380
All right, that's sounding
a little brainwashy.

20:17.426 --> 20:21.138
You don't believe that guy's a god
any more than I do.

20:25.309 --> 20:28.562
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

20:28.937 --> 20:33.233
Come on, we're friends. Are you
tryin' to tell me you don't remember

20:33.358 --> 20:37.571
- what's happened these past four years?
- I remember everything.

20:38.197 --> 20:42.493
It makes me ill to think I was forced
to pretend to be your friend.

20:42.576 --> 20:46.538
So many times I saved your life
when I wished I could watch you die.

20:48.457 --> 20:51.043
It hurts me that you would say that,

20:52.127 --> 20:55.380
but that's OK, because I know it's not true.

20:55.797 --> 20:59.843
- Your belief is not necessary.
- It doesn't make any sense.

21:00.802 --> 21:03.972
Come on! You and I have
taken down half a dozen Goa'ulds.

21:04.056 --> 21:07.476
- Enemies of Apophis.
- And we kicked his ass twice!

21:07.601 --> 21:10.771
- Hell, you watched him die once.
- I knew he would be reborn

21:10.896 --> 21:14.066
- more powerful than ever.
- I'm talkin' to a wall. Anybody?

21:14.149 --> 21:17.986
Teal'c, you remember when Apophis
brainwashed your son, Rya'c?

21:21.657 --> 21:24.076
Consider the possibility.

21:28.455 --> 21:30.499
Or don't.

21:35.420 --> 21:39.716
Unload the sarcophagus
and the crates from the cargo ship.

21:44.513 --> 21:47.349
Gotta wonder why
they didn't put us in the brig.

21:47.474 --> 21:52.437
It's on one of the lower levels. It was
probably damaged in the firefight.

21:54.982 --> 21:57.442
Think you can hot- wire this thing?

21:58.735 --> 22:02.281
I'd assume there's some safety
mechanism to ensure against that.

22:02.406 --> 22:06.535
Otherwise it'd be pretty stupid
to lock us in here, wouldn't it?

22:07.828 --> 22:10.914
Of course, I could give it a shot... sir.

22:11.456 --> 22:13.500
Thank you.

23:35.415 --> 23:39.336
- Disgusting decoration.
- Course has been plotted for Delmak.

23:39.461 --> 23:44.424
Diverting all power from shields and
weapons, and entering hyperspeed.

23:55.644 --> 23:58.480
The Tok'ra Selmak
has thus far eluded capture.

24:01.191 --> 24:04.027
I will see to it personally, my lord.

24:04.152 --> 24:06.697
I am sure you will not fail me, Teal'c.

24:23.297 --> 24:25.883
I really have no idea what I'm doing here.

24:26.592 --> 24:30.220
- Keep tryin'. You might get lucky.
- Sir, I hate to sound negative,

24:30.345 --> 24:34.808
but I think without a little more insight
into how these things actually work,

24:34.933 --> 24:37.936
I've got pretty much
zero chance of hitting...

24:39.271 --> 24:41.398
OK, maybe not zero.

24:43.317 --> 24:45.569
Come on.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.208
Inside.

25:05.172 --> 25:09.134
Come on, Teal'c.
A part of you has to know the truth.

25:09.343 --> 25:12.262
The truth is, you are
a prisoner of Apophis.

25:12.387 --> 25:16.517
When the symbiote that I carry matures,
you will become its host.

25:18.185 --> 25:20.646
OK, I... I meant the other truth.

25:22.814 --> 25:25.025
Look out!

25:36.453 --> 25:40.582
We shall die long before we reach Delmak
without new symbiotes!

25:42.000 --> 25:43.710
Apophis will live on,

25:43.794 --> 25:47.923
and we shall serve him well
until we die with honour in his name.

25:56.265 --> 25:59.351
My lord, the internal sensors
have shut down.

26:05.357 --> 26:07.693
Power is being diverted
from the hyperdrive.

26:11.947 --> 26:13.490
We're out of hyperspeed.

26:14.408 --> 26:16.827
My lord, the ship's systems are failing.

26:16.952 --> 26:19.329
I am unable to bring
the engines back on line.

26:19.496 --> 26:21.748
Harak, kla mel.

27:04.124 --> 27:06.168
Odd.

27:08.420 --> 27:09.546
Uh- oh.

27:15.511 --> 27:17.763
Uh, excuse me.

27:36.824 --> 27:39.910
- This could be a problem.
- Sir, if they've got control

27:39.993 --> 27:43.163
- of the primary systems...
- This could be a problem.

27:48.085 --> 27:51.088
It won't attack unless you threaten it.

27:54.925 --> 27:57.511
Yeah. Still, maybe we should, um...

28:10.983 --> 28:14.069
My lord, the ship
is infested with replicators.

28:14.152 --> 28:16.446
- How?
- I am unsure.

28:16.572 --> 28:18.991
- They control the engine room.
- Destroy them!

28:19.116 --> 28:23.162
We cannot. There are too many ofthem
and too few ofus. We must...

28:23.245 --> 28:25.622
Kree, Jaffa!

28:45.392 --> 28:47.436
Kree hak!

29:32.898 --> 29:35.150
Hello.

29:36.693 --> 29:40.280
It's been, what, 10, 11 hours
since we picked up the cargo ship?

29:40.405 --> 29:43.867
The replicators have had time to
reach unmanageably large numbers.

29:43.992 --> 29:46.745
Let's just hope they left
the cargo ship alone.

29:46.829 --> 29:50.707
Chances are they have. They'd focus
on controlling the mothership.

29:50.833 --> 29:53.210
Brainwashed or not,
we can't leave Teal'c.

29:53.335 --> 29:58.549
I know. You and Jacob secure
the cargo ship. Carter, you're with me.

30:07.391 --> 30:09.935
You know how to use one of these?

30:15.274 --> 30:15.858
Sure.

30:16.149 --> 30:18.986
We must ensure that Apophis
reaches the cargo bay.

30:19.111 --> 30:22.364
He is a god. Is he powerless
against these demons?

30:22.489 --> 30:25.742
What you say is blasphemy.
If I hear it again, I will kill you.

30:25.868 --> 30:28.245
If our weapons have no effect,
what can we do?

30:28.370 --> 30:31.999
Human weapons will work.
There are crates of them in storage.

30:55.063 --> 30:57.107
Jaffa.

31:32.518 --> 31:35.437
Teal'c! We've got to get off this ship!

31:35.562 --> 31:37.022
Now!

31:48.242 --> 31:52.538
Atmospheric shield is on line!
Cargo bay is pressurised.

32:02.840 --> 32:05.092
Looks clear.

32:10.013 --> 32:12.558
I have what may seem
like a dumb question.

32:12.683 --> 32:15.853
Don't we need to open
those cargo bay doors to fly out?

32:15.978 --> 32:18.897
This ship has remote access
to the door controls.

32:18.981 --> 32:23.193
- Hopefully, the bugs haven't overridden it.
- You... you don't want to check?

32:23.569 --> 32:26.405
I don't wanna tip'em off
before we have to.

32:31.118 --> 32:32.828
Sir, we gotta move!

33:12.493 --> 33:14.661
He's alive.

33:14.995 --> 33:17.456
Hope Junior keeps him that way.

33:42.189 --> 33:43.899
Yeah, here you go.

33:43.982 --> 33:46.902
- He's been shot!
- He resisted a little.

33:48.111 --> 33:53.283
- I thought you weren't gonna make it.
- I didn't say it, though.

33:54.409 --> 33:56.495
Better tie him up.

34:05.128 --> 34:08.465
- What was that?
- The mothership jumped to hyperspeed.

34:13.469 --> 34:15.848
- Now what?
- Now nothin'.

34:15.973 --> 34:20.893
We can't open the cargo bay doors
and fly out while we're in hyperspace.

34:48.630 --> 34:53.092
According to this, the ship is headed
towards the last coordinates entered:

34:53.217 --> 34:55.596
Sokar's old planet,

34:55.721 --> 34:58.223
Apophis' new base.

34:58.348 --> 35:00.642
- Uh, Dad.
- I see.

35:01.476 --> 35:05.230
The ship is travelling at ten times
its capable hyperspeed?

35:05.355 --> 35:09.276
And the speed's still increasing.
20 times... 30...

35:09.902 --> 35:13.071
This is incredible. The bugs
must have modified the engines.

35:13.155 --> 35:15.908
- They can do that?
- They can do almost anything.

35:15.991 --> 35:21.747
Blocks come together to form whatever
pattern they need to achieve their goals.

35:21.872 --> 35:25.501
- But they don't care about travelling fast.
- Only while multiplying.

35:25.626 --> 35:29.421
Once they reach a critical number, they
look for new technology to consume.

35:29.546 --> 35:34.092
Then our data about Apophis' base
must make it look pretty appetising.

35:34.218 --> 35:38.138
This is great news. We'll be back
in our own galaxy in no time.

35:38.263 --> 35:40.599
When they exit hyperspeed,
we can fly home.

35:40.724 --> 35:44.478
I wouldn't exactly call that... great news.

35:44.811 --> 35:47.481
We can't let the bugs
get a foothold in our galaxy.

35:47.606 --> 35:50.859
They're relentless.
Even the Asgard can't stop them.

35:50.984 --> 35:53.654
- What about self- destruct?
- Right.

35:53.737 --> 35:57.574
Once it was set on Apophis' ship,
the bugs couldn't shut it off.

35:57.699 --> 36:00.702
Looks like the bugs
figured out Goa'uld computers.

36:00.786 --> 36:03.247
I can't get into the main system.

36:04.623 --> 36:07.376
Let's figure this out.
We got'em on Thor's ship.

36:07.501 --> 36:09.878
- How?
- We destroyed the deceleration drive

36:10.003 --> 36:12.339
before the ship
entered Earth's atmosphere.

36:12.464 --> 36:15.300
It couldn't withstand
an uncontrolled re- entry.

36:15.425 --> 36:19.638
Goa'uld ships use sublight engines
to slow down after exiting hyperspace.

36:19.763 --> 36:23.350
- If we destroy the engine controls...
- The ship won't be able to stop.

36:23.475 --> 36:26.228
And it'll crash right into Apophis' planet.

36:26.311 --> 36:29.773
We'd have to wait until just after
the ship came out of hyperspace

36:29.898 --> 36:32.442
so the bugs have no time
to change trajectory.

36:32.568 --> 36:34.611
How do we destroy these engines?

36:34.987 --> 36:38.157
All we have to do
is eliminate the control crystals.

36:38.282 --> 36:41.994
- In the engine room.
- Which is Bug Central, probably.

36:42.828 --> 36:44.121
So we plant C4.

36:44.246 --> 36:48.000
The bugs could disable the detonator
by the time we leave and set it off.

36:48.125 --> 36:49.501
What are you saying?

36:49.626 --> 36:53.755
We would have to physically
destroy the crystals ourselves.

36:53.839 --> 36:57.217
- A P90 at close range should do the job.
- That doesn't sound...

36:57.342 --> 36:59.803
You got a better idea, Mr Positive?

37:00.470 --> 37:03.724
The ship's reached over 800 times
its previous maximum speed.

37:03.849 --> 37:07.728
One of us should get the cargo ship
charged up and ready to go.

37:07.853 --> 37:10.189
That would be you.
Carter, Daniel, with me.

37:10.314 --> 37:13.317
It's gonna be tight, guys.
You only have about 30 seconds

37:13.400 --> 37:15.777
to get from the engine room
back to the cargo bay.

37:15.903 --> 37:18.322
- Just keep it runnin'.
- All right. Good luck.

37:30.918 --> 37:32.961
Oh, crap.

37:36.423 --> 37:38.800
What the hell is that?

37:44.431 --> 37:47.351
That... is a big bug.

37:50.103 --> 37:52.231
I guess that explains the extra power.

37:52.356 --> 37:54.399
Uh, listen...

37:54.525 --> 37:56.610
Let's not wake it up.

38:10.666 --> 38:13.043
OK, the control panel...

38:35.107 --> 38:37.568
- Ready?
- Wait for it, sir.

39:05.095 --> 39:07.347
Go, go, go, go, go!

39:57.356 --> 39:59.816
That's the way we have to go.

40:00.818 --> 40:03.070
Let's go!

40:15.666 --> 40:17.960
Guys, we gotta go now!

40:19.670 --> 40:21.964
Jack! Sam! Daniel!

40:22.089 --> 40:25.259
Dad! We're cut offfrom the cargo bay.

40:25.384 --> 40:29.304
We've made it to the ring room on
level ten. Can you ring us up remotely?

40:29.429 --> 40:31.765
- I'll try.
- Hurry!

40:41.525 --> 40:43.986
- Thanks.
- Let's get outta here!

40:52.286 --> 40:56.957
- The doors are closing.
- They've overridden our controls.

41:00.127 --> 41:03.297
- Are we gonna make it?
- I don't wanna say.

41:39.708 --> 41:42.252
- I'm gonna check on Teal'c.
- Jack...

41:43.420 --> 41:47.883
You got his body back. Getting
his mind back may not be as easy.

42:11.031 --> 42:15.160
You may torture me all you wish.
I will tell you nothing.

42:16.078 --> 42:18.539
I'm sorry I had to shoot you.

42:18.664 --> 42:21.416
You didn't give me much choice, though.

42:25.838 --> 42:28.674
Apophis... is dead.

42:38.225 --> 42:40.686
I do not believe you.

42:41.228 --> 42:43.605
Trust me.

42:45.440 --> 42:47.651
Gods cannot be killed.
