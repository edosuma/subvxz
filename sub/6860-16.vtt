04:03.344 --> 04:04.878
My people have been massacred,

04:04.946 --> 04:07.581

04:07.649 --> 04:09.149
I can't explain everything now

04:09.216 --> 04:13.119
but Almec has the support
of the crime families.

04:13.187 --> 04:16.454
Obi-Wan, I need your help.

04:19.192 --> 04:22.195
Your thoughts on this, Master Kenobi.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.965
Satine has been at odds
with the Death Watch for years.

04:26.033 --> 04:29.202
And according to a report
from Padawan Tano,

04:29.270 --> 04:31.872
they're no longer in league
with the Separatists.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.707
If there was a takeover on Mandalore,

04:33.774 --> 04:35.709
it was most likely an independent act

04:35.776 --> 04:38.145
caused by the Death Watch alone.

04:38.213 --> 04:40.547
Without involvement
from the Separatists,

04:40.615 --> 04:43.651
this is an internal affair
for the Mandalorians.

04:43.719 --> 04:45.486
I'm afraid we cannot help.

04:45.554 --> 04:48.456
We cannot just hand Mandalore
over to these crime families

04:48.524 --> 04:50.125
and let Satine become a martyr.

04:50.192 --> 04:52.761
I'm afraid her decision
to keep Mandalore neutral

04:52.828 --> 04:55.563
makes this situation difficult.

04:55.631 --> 04:58.733
Understand your feelings I do,
Obi-Wan.

04:58.801 --> 05:00.235
But to take action,

05:00.303 --> 05:03.672
support from the Republic Senate
we will need.

05:03.739 --> 05:06.107
You know what the Senate will decide.

05:06.175 --> 05:09.244
They will not send aid
to a neutral system.

05:09.312 --> 05:13.615
At this time, nothing more can we do.

05:17.887 --> 05:19.888
Satine's accomplices have escaped,

05:19.956 --> 05:22.557

Death Watch soldiers.

What of the people?

05:33.603 --> 05:36.071
You are the legitimate prime minister.

05:36.139 --> 05:37.740
Mandalore is a sovereign planet

05:37.808 --> 05:41.043

05:46.682 --> 05:49.217
