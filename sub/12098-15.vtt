ANNOUNCER:
<i>In the last episode of</i> Soap,

00:04.571 --> 00:06.071
<i>Chester broke the news</i>

00:06.072 --> 00:07.573
<i>that he's in love</i>
<i>with the minister's daughter,</i>

00:07.574 --> 00:09.074
<i>and while it didn't</i>
<i>break her spirit,</i>

00:09.075 --> 00:11.076
<i>Jessica threw him</i>
<i>out of the house.</i>

00:11.077 --> 00:13.078
<i>Burt, because he only has</i>
<i>a short time to live,</i>

00:13.079 --> 00:14.079
<i>is trying to break a record,</i>

00:14.080 --> 00:16.081
<i>but might wind up</i>
<i>breaking his neck.</i>

00:16.082 --> 00:17.583
<i>But he hasn't</i>
<i>broken the news to Mary</i>

00:17.584 --> 00:19.084
<i>that he's going to die.</i>

00:19.085 --> 00:20.586
<i>Eunice has been cheating</i>
<i>on Dutch,</i>

00:20.587 --> 00:23.088
<i>and might get her head broken</i>
<i>if he finds out.</i>

00:23.089 --> 00:25.090
<i>And Polly's family</i>
<i>met the Campbells,</i>

00:25.091 --> 00:27.092
<i>and nobody broke any records</i>
<i>in getting along.</i>

00:27.093 --> 00:28.594
<i>Confused?</i>

00:28.595 --> 00:31.598
<i>You won't be</i>
<i>after this episode of...</i> Soap.

00:36.102 --> 00:38.103
<i>This is the story</i>
<i>of two sisters,</i>

00:38.104 --> 00:40.606
<i>Jessica Tate...</i>

00:40.607 --> 00:42.608
<i>and Mary Campbell.</i>

00:42.609 --> 00:46.111
<i>These are the Tates...</i>

00:46.112 --> 00:50.115
<i>and these are the Campbells...</i>

00:50.116 --> 00:53.619
<i>and this is...</i> Soap.

00:56.122 --> 00:58.624

01:22.148 --> 01:25.150
120...

01:25.151 --> 01:26.652
and one.

01:26.653 --> 01:29.154
For the record.

01:29.155 --> 01:31.657
You sure this guy
caught 120 quarters?

01:31.658 --> 01:33.158
That's what the book says.

01:33.159 --> 01:34.660
Stand back.
You ready? Yeah.

01:34.661 --> 01:35.661
Hey!
Oh!

01:38.665 --> 01:39.665
Burt!

01:39.666 --> 01:41.166
I don't get it. I don't get it.

01:41.167 --> 01:42.167
This guy caught 120.

01:42.168 --> 01:44.169
I caught one.
I got 120 on the floor here.

01:44.170 --> 01:46.171
Burt, what are you doing?

01:46.172 --> 01:47.673
Told you, Mare, I'm trying

01:47.674 --> 01:49.675
to get into the <i>Guinness Book</i>
<i>of World Records.</i>

01:49.676 --> 01:50.676
Well, what happened
to the balloons?

01:50.677 --> 01:52.177
They kept breaking.

01:52.178 --> 01:53.679
Hey, how about this?

01:53.680 --> 01:55.180
Spitting.

01:55.181 --> 01:56.181
Hell, I'm leaving.

01:56.182 --> 01:57.182
Bob...

01:57.183 --> 02:01.186
The longest distance spit,
31 feet, one inch.

02:01.187 --> 02:03.689
Well, that guy must've
had some kind of cold.

02:05.191 --> 02:07.192
Hey, hey, wait a minute.
Look at this one here.

02:07.193 --> 02:08.193
Wait.

02:08.193 --> 02:10.696
This guy dove 40 feet
from the Flatiron Building

02:10.697 --> 02:12.698
into a child's wading pool

02:12.699 --> 02:15.702
filled with 12 and a half
inches of water.

02:17.203 --> 02:18.704
Mare, where are my trunks?

02:18.705 --> 02:19.705
Burt, are you crazy?

02:19.706 --> 02:21.206
No, Mare.

02:21.207 --> 02:22.708
Come on,
I really want to do this.

02:22.709 --> 02:23.709
Why? What for?

02:23.710 --> 02:25.210
For the baby.
I told you,

02:25.211 --> 02:28.213
so the baby has a father
really to be proud of, you know?

02:28.214 --> 02:29.715
Burt, this is insane.

02:29.716 --> 02:31.216
You cannot dive off a building.

02:31.217 --> 02:32.718
What if you miss?

02:32.719 --> 02:33.719
If he misses,

02:33.720 --> 02:35.721
he doesn't break the record.

02:35.722 --> 02:37.723
If he misses,
the baby has no father.

02:37.724 --> 02:39.725
Burt, stop this, okay?

02:39.726 --> 02:42.227
You don't need to do this.

02:42.228 --> 02:44.229
Oh, yeah, Mare, I do.

02:44.230 --> 02:45.230
I need to leave my mark.

02:45.231 --> 02:46.231
You want to leave your mark?

02:46.232 --> 02:48.233
Then how about diving off
the Flatiron Building

02:48.234 --> 02:49.735
into no water?

02:52.739 --> 02:54.239
Boys, would you
excuse us, please?

02:54.240 --> 02:55.741
I'd like to talk to Burt alone.

02:56.743 --> 02:58.243
Hey, Burt, uh...

02:58.244 --> 03:00.746
how about the first guy
to survive a decapitation?

03:02.248 --> 03:03.248
Okay.

03:05.752 --> 03:06.752
Burt...

03:06.753 --> 03:07.753
Look, Mare.
I don't believe this.

03:07.754 --> 03:08.754
Look at this.

03:08.755 --> 03:10.255
This guy ate a bicycle.

03:10.256 --> 03:12.758
An entire bicycle, Mare.

03:12.759 --> 03:14.259
This little French guy.

03:14.260 --> 03:15.761
Burt, I want to talk to you.

03:15.762 --> 03:18.764
The tires alone
must have taken a month to chew.

03:18.765 --> 03:19.765
Burt, put that book away.

03:19.766 --> 03:22.768
Maybe I could eat a moped.

03:22.769 --> 03:23.769
Burt...

03:23.770 --> 03:24.770
Come on, Mare.

03:24.771 --> 03:26.271
Burt, what's wrong?

03:26.272 --> 03:27.773
You took my book.

03:27.774 --> 03:29.775
No, Burt, not that.

03:29.776 --> 03:31.276
What's going on with you?

03:31.277 --> 03:33.779
You have been acting so strange.

03:33.780 --> 03:36.281
How am I acting strange?

03:36.282 --> 03:38.283
You want to dive off a building
and eat a Mercedes.

03:38.284 --> 03:40.285
That's not strange?

03:40.286 --> 03:44.790
If I ate a car,
it'd have to be an economy car.

03:44.791 --> 03:46.792
Burt, please, talk to me.

03:46.793 --> 03:48.293
What's going on?

03:48.294 --> 03:50.796
Mare, I want to do something
that makes me special.

03:50.797 --> 03:53.799
Oh, Burt, you are special.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.300
Yeah, well, to you, Mare,

03:55.301 --> 03:56.802
but what about
the rest of the world?

03:56.803 --> 03:58.804
I want to be special
to the whole world.

03:58.805 --> 04:01.306
To the whole world?

04:01.307 --> 04:02.808
Would be nice.

04:02.809 --> 04:05.811
Listen, I want you to be able
to open a book some day

04:05.812 --> 04:06.812
and read about me.

04:06.813 --> 04:08.814
That way, I'll always be here.

04:08.815 --> 04:13.318
Burt, I'd much rather
have you here in person, okay?

04:13.319 --> 04:15.320
Yeah, well, Mare,

04:15.321 --> 04:16.761
you're not always
going to have that.

04:18.825 --> 04:21.327
I mean, some days,
I could go to work...

04:22.829 --> 04:25.831
and then all you have to do
is open a book and be reminded.

04:25.832 --> 04:26.832
I don't need that.

04:26.833 --> 04:28.333
I'm reminded all the time.

04:28.334 --> 04:29.835
Yeah, but other people.
What about other people?

04:29.836 --> 04:32.337
Other people might want to read
about me while I'm at work.

04:32.338 --> 04:33.338
Burt...

04:33.339 --> 04:34.840
Come on, Mare.
And the baby.

04:34.841 --> 04:36.842
Come on, the baby might
want to read about me

04:36.843 --> 04:37.843
in a book someday.

04:37.844 --> 04:39.344
The baby will dribble
all over the book.

04:39.345 --> 04:40.846
Burt, listen...

04:40.847 --> 04:42.347
Dribble?

04:42.348 --> 04:43.348
They do that.

04:43.349 --> 04:44.850
Dribble. Dribble. That's it.

04:44.851 --> 04:46.351
Mare, I'll dribble.

04:46.352 --> 04:48.353
It's not very becoming, Burt.

04:48.354 --> 04:49.855
No, a basketball dribble.

04:49.856 --> 04:51.857
The longest basketball dribble.

04:51.858 --> 04:53.358
Mare, you're a genius.

04:53.359 --> 04:54.359
Danny, a basketball!

04:54.360 --> 04:56.361
This is the big one here!

04:56.362 --> 04:57.362
Burt, stop it.

04:57.363 --> 04:58.864
Now, just stop it a minute.

04:58.865 --> 05:00.365
Something is wrong.

05:00.366 --> 05:01.366
I can feel it.

05:01.367 --> 05:02.868
There's something
you're not telling me.

05:02.869 --> 05:03.869
No.

05:03.870 --> 05:05.871
Burt, I know you.

05:05.872 --> 05:08.373
What's wrong?

05:08.374 --> 05:09.875
Nothing, Mare.

05:09.876 --> 05:11.376
Nothing.

05:11.377 --> 05:12.878
Swear to God and hope to die.

05:12.879 --> 05:13.879
Oh, terrific.

05:13.880 --> 05:15.380
Mare, nothing's wrong.

05:15.381 --> 05:16.381
Nothing.

05:16.382 --> 05:17.883
Nothing?

05:17.884 --> 05:19.384
Nothing.

05:19.385 --> 05:20.385
Okay, Burt.

05:20.386 --> 05:21.386
Here's the basketball.

05:21.387 --> 05:23.388
What are you going to do,
swallow it?

05:23.389 --> 05:25.390
Open the door, Danny, please.

05:25.391 --> 05:26.391
Count.

05:26.392 --> 05:27.893
One, two, three, four...

05:35.902 --> 05:37.402
That's a good boy.

05:37.403 --> 05:39.404
Now, you go to sleep, okay?

05:39.405 --> 05:40.405
Hey, Corinne.

05:40.406 --> 05:41.907
Hi, Dutch.

05:41.908 --> 05:43.408
Is he sleeping?
Ah, not a chance.

05:43.409 --> 05:45.410
He needs less sleep than I do.

05:45.411 --> 05:46.411
Here. I made these.

05:46.412 --> 05:47.412
Animal Crackers.

05:47.413 --> 05:48.914
Oh, Dutch, how sweet.

05:48.915 --> 05:51.416
Oh, look at them.

05:51.417 --> 05:53.919
Look, a dog.

05:53.920 --> 05:55.921
It's an elephant.

05:55.922 --> 05:57.923
Where's his trunk?

05:57.924 --> 05:58.924
Here.

05:58.925 --> 06:00.425
Oh.

06:00.426 --> 06:02.427
Oh, and this is a cat.

06:02.428 --> 06:04.930
A cow.

06:04.931 --> 06:06.932
It looks like a cat.

06:06.933 --> 06:07.933
That's because
it's sitting down.

06:07.934 --> 06:09.935
It's a cow sitting down.

06:09.936 --> 06:11.436
See?

06:11.437 --> 06:14.439
Oh, yes, of course.

06:14.440 --> 06:16.441
They're for you
and little Timmy.

06:16.442 --> 06:17.943
Oh, good.

06:17.944 --> 06:20.445
Timmy'll have one
and I'll have 30.

06:20.446 --> 06:21.446
Thanks, Dutch.

06:21.447 --> 06:22.447
Hey, you're welcome.

06:22.448 --> 06:24.449
I had fun making them.

06:24.450 --> 06:26.451
Dutch, is something wrong?

06:26.452 --> 06:27.452
No, nothing, nothing.

06:27.453 --> 06:28.954
Oh.

06:28.955 --> 06:29.955
Yeah.

06:29.956 --> 06:30.956
What is it?

06:30.957 --> 06:31.957
I don't know
what to do, Corinne.

06:31.958 --> 06:33.959
I've thought
and thought about it,

06:33.960 --> 06:35.460
and I don't know what to do.

06:35.461 --> 06:36.962
What do you think I should do?

06:36.963 --> 06:38.964
Well, it would help
to know about what.

06:38.965 --> 06:40.465
Eunice.
Oh, Eunice.

06:40.466 --> 06:41.466
Your sister.

06:41.467 --> 06:42.968
Yes, I know.

06:42.969 --> 06:43.969
I caught her with
another guy, Corinne,

06:43.970 --> 06:45.971
and she promised
she'd never do it again,

06:45.972 --> 06:46.972
and I should believe her.

06:46.973 --> 06:47.973
I'm supposed to believe her,

06:47.974 --> 06:49.474
and there's no reason
not to believe her,

06:49.475 --> 06:52.978
but I don't believe her.

06:52.979 --> 06:53.979
Would I believe her?

06:53.980 --> 06:54.980
Oh, well, let me see.

06:54.981 --> 06:56.481
Would I believe her?

06:56.482 --> 06:57.983
That's a good question.

06:57.984 --> 06:59.985
Boy. Would I believe her?

06:59.986 --> 07:00.986
She's never home.

07:00.987 --> 07:03.488
Never home, yeah.

07:03.489 --> 07:04.489
Wait a minute.

07:04.490 --> 07:06.491
I can't ask you that.

07:06.492 --> 07:07.993
You can't rat
on your own sister.

07:07.994 --> 07:09.995
Hey, I'm sorry, Corinne.

07:09.996 --> 07:12.497
Just forget I asked that, okay?

07:12.498 --> 07:14.499
It's just that...

07:14.500 --> 07:17.002
I guess I needed
somebody to talk to.

07:17.003 --> 07:19.004
You know,
I ain't got nobody to talk to.

07:19.005 --> 07:22.007
Oh, Dutch, you can talk to me.

07:22.008 --> 07:23.508
I want you to know that.

07:23.509 --> 07:25.510
You can always talk to me.

07:25.511 --> 07:28.013
Thanks, Corinne.

07:28.014 --> 07:31.516
I just might not be able
to answer.

07:31.517 --> 07:34.519
Corinne,
can I ask you a question?

07:34.520 --> 07:36.521
Sure.

07:36.522 --> 07:39.024
Do you find me stupid?

07:39.025 --> 07:44.029
Dutch, you are
one of the nicest people I know.

07:44.030 --> 07:45.530
Aw, come on.

07:45.531 --> 07:46.531
No, really.

07:46.532 --> 07:48.033
I mean it.

07:48.034 --> 07:52.037
You're good and kind and loving,
and not at all stupid.

07:52.038 --> 07:56.041
In fact, I'm...
I'm proud to know you.

07:56.042 --> 07:57.542
Hey, thanks, Corinne.

07:57.543 --> 08:01.046
You just can't make a cow.

08:13.059 --> 08:15.061
♪ It's gonna happen tonight ♪

08:18.564 --> 08:23.068
♪ It's gonna happen ♪

08:23.069 --> 08:27.073
♪ And it's gonna be right ♪

08:29.575 --> 08:32.077
George, aren't you ever
going to sit down?

08:32.078 --> 08:35.080
Just making things
perfect, my pet.

08:37.082 --> 08:38.582
You'll have to hold it
all the time.

08:38.583 --> 08:40.085
I lost the bottom.

08:46.592 --> 08:48.593
Happy anniversary.

08:48.594 --> 08:50.595
Anniversary?

08:50.596 --> 08:52.598
Well, we've been married
an hour.

08:56.542 --> 08:58.103
And I can't wait
another moment for you.

08:58.104 --> 08:59.604
Mm. I'll say.

08:59.605 --> 09:01.106
You shot out of that chapel

09:01.107 --> 09:02.607
like a sprinter.

09:02.608 --> 09:04.610
I barely got out my vows.

09:07.113 --> 09:11.616
You're so... large.

09:11.617 --> 09:13.619
God, you're virile.

09:15.121 --> 09:18.123
Sorry about Mexico, my sweet.

09:18.124 --> 09:20.625
We'll go there next year.

09:20.626 --> 09:21.626
You'll want to kill that drink

09:21.627 --> 09:24.129
so you can put the glass down.

09:24.130 --> 09:25.130
Well, I don't know

09:25.131 --> 09:26.631
why we can't go to Mexico now.

09:26.632 --> 09:29.134
I mean, it is our honeymoon.

09:29.135 --> 09:31.137
Don't be silly,
my little chrysanthemum.

09:35.141 --> 09:38.143
If we went there now,
we wouldn't see anything.

09:38.144 --> 09:39.144
All I'd see is you,

09:39.145 --> 09:40.145
and all you'd see

09:40.146 --> 09:43.648
is the ceiling
of the Acapulco Hilton.

09:44.650 --> 09:46.151
George, I hear a knock.

09:46.152 --> 09:49.654
Mm, the pounding
of my heart, hummingbird.

09:49.655 --> 09:51.156
No, George.
I think it's the door.

09:51.157 --> 09:53.158
Don't you hear it?
Listen.

09:54.660 --> 09:55.660
There.

09:55.661 --> 09:59.164
Woodpeckers.
Get back down.

09:59.165 --> 10:02.167
It's probably a woman
from your past.

10:02.168 --> 10:04.669
Don't be silly, precious cargo.

10:04.670 --> 10:08.173
There's no woman from my past.

10:08.174 --> 10:10.175
Really, George?

10:10.176 --> 10:12.177
Not anymore.

10:14.180 --> 10:15.180
I'll get it.

10:15.181 --> 10:16.681
What?
Dressed like that?

10:16.682 --> 10:17.682
It's probably the plumber,

10:17.683 --> 10:19.184
and he's Greek.

10:19.185 --> 10:20.185
One look at you,

10:20.186 --> 10:21.186
he'll attack you in the hall.

10:21.187 --> 10:22.687
No, I'll get it.

10:22.688 --> 10:24.189
You slip into something
less comfortable.

10:24.190 --> 10:25.190
Hmph.

10:25.191 --> 10:27.192
Another woman indeed.

10:27.193 --> 10:28.693
Why there's only one other woman

10:28.694 --> 10:30.195
I was ever remotely
in love with,

10:30.196 --> 10:31.697
and she's married.

10:33.699 --> 10:35.200
Million miles away.

10:37.203 --> 10:38.703
Hi.

10:38.704 --> 10:41.206
And here she is.

10:41.207 --> 10:42.707
Jess.

10:42.708 --> 10:44.209
George, how are you?

10:44.210 --> 10:45.210
Oh, Jess, how would...

10:45.211 --> 10:47.712
George, George, George.

10:47.713 --> 10:49.214
Oh, Jess.

10:49.215 --> 10:50.215
I mean, speak of the devil...

10:50.216 --> 10:52.217
Wait a minute.

10:52.218 --> 10:53.218
Uh, plumber.

10:53.219 --> 10:56.222
Retsina, ouzo,
uh, moussaka, olives!

10:58.224 --> 11:01.726
George, I have
something to tell you.

11:01.727 --> 11:03.728
I have something
to tell you too.

11:03.729 --> 11:05.730
Are you happy to see me?

11:05.731 --> 11:06.731
Happy...

11:08.734 --> 11:11.236
Oh. May I come in?

11:11.237 --> 11:12.737
In where?

11:12.738 --> 11:14.739
Oh, the apartment.

11:14.740 --> 11:16.241
Why, sure.

11:16.242 --> 11:17.242
Come in.

11:17.243 --> 11:18.743
Come in.

11:18.744 --> 11:19.744
Stand right there.

11:19.745 --> 11:22.247
Would you like a potato chip?

11:22.248 --> 11:25.250
George, I really must
speak with you.

11:25.251 --> 11:26.251
Jess, uh...

11:26.252 --> 11:27.752
I love you, George.

11:27.753 --> 11:28.753
Oh, Jess.

11:28.754 --> 11:30.255
I know. I know.

11:30.256 --> 11:32.257
If I had chosen you
in the first place,

11:32.258 --> 11:34.259
I wouldn't
have to come back here

11:34.260 --> 11:37.262
in the second place,

11:37.263 --> 11:39.764
but now I have a second chance
to make the choice

11:39.765 --> 11:41.266
I should have made
in the first place,

11:41.267 --> 11:42.767
and it's not too late

11:42.768 --> 11:44.769
for a second chance
to make that choice.

11:44.770 --> 11:46.771
Oh, George, I love you.

11:46.772 --> 11:50.275
I really, really love you,

11:50.276 --> 11:52.777
and I never stopped.

11:52.778 --> 11:54.279
Oh, George.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.280
Mm, mm...

11:55.281 --> 11:56.781
I was so foolish

11:56.782 --> 11:58.783
to ever think that
Chester or any other man

11:58.784 --> 12:00.285
could love me the way you do.

12:00.286 --> 12:02.287
I have this...

12:02.288 --> 12:03.788
I hope you still do.

12:03.789 --> 12:05.290
Oh, George.

12:05.291 --> 12:07.292
My George.

12:07.293 --> 12:08.793
Oh, Jess. Jess...

12:08.794 --> 12:10.295
Oh, no, George, not now.

12:13.799 --> 12:15.800
We have plenty
of time for that later.

12:15.801 --> 12:17.302
We have the rest of our lives.

12:17.303 --> 12:19.304
I got...

12:19.305 --> 12:21.306
I know, you got rejected,

12:21.307 --> 12:23.308
but darling, he was my husband,

12:23.309 --> 12:25.810
and I had the children
to think about.

12:25.811 --> 12:26.811
Okay, but...

12:26.812 --> 12:28.813
Oh, I'm so happy.

12:28.814 --> 12:30.815
There's so much we haven't done,

12:30.816 --> 12:34.319
and now nothing can stop us.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.321
Nothing. Nothing.

12:36.322 --> 12:37.322
Oh, George, I...

12:37.323 --> 12:41.326
Oh, now, that...
that might stop us right there.

12:41.327 --> 12:43.328
George!

12:43.329 --> 12:44.329
Uh, uh...

12:44.330 --> 12:45.330
Oh, George.

12:45.331 --> 12:47.832
You needn't be so embarrassed.

12:47.833 --> 12:49.834
I mean, you didn't know
you were getting me back.

12:49.835 --> 12:51.836
Perhaps I should leave
for an hour.

12:51.837 --> 12:53.338
Come back.

12:53.339 --> 12:55.340
Jess, it's a little more
complicated than that.

12:55.341 --> 12:56.341
How do you do?

12:56.342 --> 12:57.842
I'm Jessica.

12:57.843 --> 12:59.344
George?

12:59.345 --> 13:00.345
Uh, uh, Jessica,

13:00.346 --> 13:03.348
this is Shirley Slotnik Donohue.

13:03.349 --> 13:06.351
Your sister. Of course.

13:06.352 --> 13:07.852
I should have guessed.

13:07.853 --> 13:11.356
You have the same slippers.

13:11.357 --> 13:12.357
No.

13:12.358 --> 13:15.360
Uh, Jess, Shirley's my wife.

13:15.361 --> 13:17.862
I'm sorry.

13:17.863 --> 13:18.863
Not that you're my wife.

13:18.864 --> 13:20.365
I mean,
I'm sorry that she was...

13:20.366 --> 13:22.867
Oh, never mind.

13:22.868 --> 13:24.369
Oh, Mrs. Donohue,

13:24.370 --> 13:27.872
please don't be angry
with George.

13:27.873 --> 13:30.375
He had no idea that I...

13:32.878 --> 13:34.879
Excuse me, I...

13:34.880 --> 13:37.883
I think I'd just like to go.

13:39.385 --> 13:40.885
Uh, Jess, wait.

13:40.886 --> 13:43.388
Pumpkin, could we have
a moment together?

13:43.389 --> 13:45.390
George, this is our honeymoon.

13:45.391 --> 13:46.891
And this is my friend.

13:46.892 --> 13:48.393
Just five minutes.

13:49.395 --> 13:50.895
No, Shirley,
don't leave the room.

13:50.896 --> 13:52.397
It's not necessary.

13:52.398 --> 13:53.398
But Jess...

13:53.399 --> 13:54.399
No.

13:54.400 --> 13:55.900
No secrets.

13:55.901 --> 13:59.904
That's a bad way
to start a new life together.

13:59.905 --> 14:01.907
I think I should just go.

14:04.410 --> 14:05.910
Are you okay?

14:05.911 --> 14:08.913
Perfect.

14:08.914 --> 14:10.415
Jessica, please stay.

14:10.416 --> 14:13.418
I'll go for a walk.

14:13.419 --> 14:14.919
Thank you, Shirley.

14:14.920 --> 14:17.922
That's very nice of you.

14:17.923 --> 14:19.424
You're a very lucky woman.

14:19.425 --> 14:21.426
He's a fine man.

14:21.427 --> 14:23.929
Take care of each other.

14:25.931 --> 14:28.433
Goodbye, Shirley.

14:28.434 --> 14:29.935
Goodbye, George.

14:52.958 --> 14:54.459
She's a lovely girl.

14:54.460 --> 14:55.460
He's a lovely boy.

14:55.461 --> 14:56.461
They're a lovely couple.

14:56.462 --> 14:57.462
Lovely.

14:57.463 --> 14:58.963
We should be thrilled.

14:58.964 --> 14:59.964
I know.

14:59.965 --> 15:02.467
I'm going to shoot myself.

15:02.468 --> 15:04.970
Give me the gun
when you're done.

15:12.478 --> 15:14.979
Jess. Hi.

15:18.484 --> 15:20.985
Jessica, this is Rose Coleman,

15:20.986 --> 15:22.487
Polly's mother.

15:22.488 --> 15:23.988
This is my sister, Jessica Tate.

15:23.989 --> 15:24.989
Hello.

15:24.990 --> 15:26.491
Sit down, Jess.

15:26.492 --> 15:28.494
Tea?

15:31.497 --> 15:33.499
So, how are you?

15:35.501 --> 15:37.503
Oh. Jess, what is it?

15:42.007 --> 15:45.510
Would you like to be alone

15:45.511 --> 15:48.013
with your sister?

15:52.518 --> 15:54.019
Are you depressed?

15:59.525 --> 16:02.527
Oh, Jess, I'm sorry.

16:02.528 --> 16:04.028
It's amazing

16:04.029 --> 16:06.031
how they can learn to read lips
so easily.

16:08.033 --> 16:09.534
I was saying,

16:09.535 --> 16:13.038
it's amazing
how well you read lips.

16:15.541 --> 16:17.041
She doesn't read lips.

16:17.042 --> 16:19.043
Well, she seems
to understand everything.

16:19.044 --> 16:22.046
She hears.

16:22.047 --> 16:23.548
Oh, then she's not deaf.

16:23.549 --> 16:25.550
No.
Oh.

16:25.551 --> 16:26.552
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:29.555 --> 16:31.557
Then you are mute.

16:35.561 --> 16:37.563
Then you are deaf.

16:39.565 --> 16:41.065
What are you?

16:41.066 --> 16:42.567
She's depressed.

16:47.072 --> 16:49.073
Then she can speak.

16:49.074 --> 16:50.074
Yes.

16:50.075 --> 16:51.576
Right, Jess?

16:51.577 --> 16:53.077
She can speak.

16:53.078 --> 16:54.579
Say something, Jess.

16:59.084 --> 17:00.084
It's okay.

17:00.085 --> 17:01.586
I believe you.

17:01.587 --> 17:02.587
You don't have to.
It's all right.

17:02.588 --> 17:04.088
Say "Hi."

17:04.089 --> 17:05.450
No, it's all right.
It's all right.

17:06.090 --> 17:07.592
Hi.

17:07.593 --> 17:11.596
See?

17:11.597 --> 17:13.097
I'm sorry,

17:13.098 --> 17:15.599
but when I get depressed,
I-I can't speak.

17:15.601 --> 17:18.102
My lips get sealed shut.

17:18.103 --> 17:20.605
Rose and I
are kind of depressed too.

17:20.606 --> 17:22.106
Oh? About what?

17:22.107 --> 17:23.608
Polly and Danny.

17:23.608 --> 17:26.109
That's what's depressing you?

17:26.111 --> 17:28.112
Well, yes.

17:28.113 --> 17:31.115
And that's
what's depressing you too?

17:31.116 --> 17:32.617
Well, sort of.

17:34.119 --> 17:35.620
She does this all the time.

17:35.621 --> 17:36.621
Watch.

17:36.622 --> 17:38.122
Her depression will be bigger.

17:38.123 --> 17:41.125
Much bigger.

17:41.126 --> 17:43.628
I just came
from Detective Donohue's.

17:43.629 --> 17:47.632
See, my husband had amnesia,
and he got lost,

17:47.633 --> 17:50.134
so I hired Detective Donohue
to find him,

17:50.135 --> 17:52.637
and what he found
was that Chester had died,

17:52.638 --> 17:55.139
so I had an affair
with Detective Donohue,

17:55.140 --> 17:56.641
and we fell in love,

17:56.642 --> 17:58.142
and then Chester came back...

17:58.143 --> 18:00.144
of course, not from the dead,

18:00.145 --> 18:02.146
because he never was
really dead...

18:02.147 --> 18:03.648
and then I had to choose,

18:03.649 --> 18:06.150
and I chose Chester,
which was the wrong choice,

18:06.151 --> 18:07.652
because Chester
chose to play around,

18:07.653 --> 18:09.153
and he left me
for the minister's daughter,

18:09.154 --> 18:12.156
so I went to Detective Donohue's
to tell him that I was his,

18:12.157 --> 18:15.160
but it was too late...
he's hers.

18:20.165 --> 18:21.165
Whose?

18:21.166 --> 18:22.166
His wife's.

18:22.167 --> 18:25.169
My husband's gone off
with a young woman.

18:25.170 --> 18:28.172
The man I love
is married to someone else.

18:28.173 --> 18:31.175
My children are all grown.

18:31.176 --> 18:34.679
I've lost everyone.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.182
I'm alone.

18:39.184 --> 18:44.189
All, all alone.

18:47.192 --> 18:49.694
She did it again.

18:49.695 --> 18:51.696
She topped me.

18:51.697 --> 18:53.698
She always does that.

18:53.699 --> 18:55.200
She always has one... better.

19:18.724 --> 19:20.224
Thanks, Dutch.
No problem.

19:22.728 --> 19:24.729
Did I scare you, sweetums?

19:24.730 --> 19:25.730
How dare you, Dutch?

19:25.731 --> 19:27.231
Sneaking up on me like that...

19:27.232 --> 19:30.735
You want to talk about sneaking?
Let's talk about sneaking.

19:30.736 --> 19:31.736
What are you talking about?

19:31.737 --> 19:33.237
You don't know
what I'm talking about?

19:33.238 --> 19:34.739
I have absolutely no idea.

19:34.740 --> 19:36.240
How's the Hong Kong Gardens,

19:36.241 --> 19:37.742
for starters, Eunice?

19:37.743 --> 19:38.743
Wasn't me.

19:38.744 --> 19:40.244
You had the sweet and sour pork.

19:40.245 --> 19:41.245
He had the chicken lo mein.

19:41.246 --> 19:44.248
I had the moo goo gai pan,
and it wasn't very good.

19:44.249 --> 19:46.250
There is a perfectly
good explanation

19:46.251 --> 19:47.752
why I was there tonight, Dutch.

19:47.753 --> 19:50.254
I was having dinner
with my girlfriend.

19:50.255 --> 19:51.756
That was a guy.

19:51.757 --> 19:54.258
That was my girlfriend Barbara.

19:54.259 --> 19:55.259
Barbara has a beard?

19:55.260 --> 19:57.261
It's glandular.

19:57.262 --> 19:59.263
Eunice, I followed you
all over town.

19:59.264 --> 20:00.765
That guy was no lady.

20:00.766 --> 20:02.266
You scoundrel.

20:02.267 --> 20:03.768
You absolute scoundrel.

20:03.769 --> 20:05.770
You've been spying on me.

20:05.771 --> 20:08.272
That's it. I've put up with
just about everything from you,

20:08.273 --> 20:09.273
but that's it.

20:09.274 --> 20:10.274
I've had enough.

20:10.275 --> 20:11.776
What are you going to do?

20:11.777 --> 20:12.778
Do? Do?

20:19.284 --> 20:20.785
I'm not going to
do nothing, Eunice.

20:20.786 --> 20:22.286
I mean, we could yell and scream

20:22.287 --> 20:23.287
and lose control,

20:23.288 --> 20:24.789
or we can sit and talk

20:24.790 --> 20:26.791
like two intelligent people.

20:26.792 --> 20:28.793
You know what I mean, Eunice?

20:28.794 --> 20:30.795
Control.

20:30.796 --> 20:32.797
That's what separates
us homo sapiens

20:32.798 --> 20:34.799
from the lower forms
of animal life.

20:34.800 --> 20:39.804
Dignity... and control.

20:46.812 --> 20:48.313
Dutch, I know just how you feel.

20:50.816 --> 20:52.817
That door
is always getting stuck.

20:52.818 --> 20:54.318
It makes me so mad.

20:54.319 --> 20:55.820
Oh, I'm getting out of here.

20:55.821 --> 20:57.321
I'm not through
with you yet, Eunice.

20:57.322 --> 20:59.824
You stay away from me,
you monster!

20:59.825 --> 21:00.825
You two having a fight?

21:00.826 --> 21:01.826
No, that's dangerous!

21:01.827 --> 21:02.828
Throw this.

21:04.830 --> 21:06.330
I can't stand it!

21:06.331 --> 21:07.331
You always spy on me.

21:07.332 --> 21:08.833
You never take your eyes off me.

21:08.834 --> 21:09.834
You are driving me crazy,

21:09.835 --> 21:11.335
and I'm getting out!

21:11.336 --> 21:12.837
Not that.
I just had it fixed.

21:15.340 --> 21:16.841
What's going on?

21:16.842 --> 21:17.842
Nothing, dear.

21:17.843 --> 21:19.844
Get out of the line of fire.

21:19.845 --> 21:23.347
What happened
to the refrigerator?

21:23.348 --> 21:24.348
Isn't that nice?

21:24.349 --> 21:27.852
Now you can see inside
from everywhere in the room.

21:34.860 --> 21:36.360
Any casualties?

21:36.361 --> 21:37.361
No, Daddy.

21:37.362 --> 21:38.863
What did they hit us with?

21:38.864 --> 21:42.366
Sixteens? Buzz bombs?

21:42.367 --> 21:43.367
No, sir.

21:43.368 --> 21:44.368
I'm afraid it's my fault.

21:44.369 --> 21:45.369
Who are you?

21:45.370 --> 21:46.370
Dutch.

21:46.371 --> 21:49.373
Prairie crackers.

21:49.374 --> 21:52.376
If you're Dutch,
you'd be on our side.

21:52.377 --> 21:53.377
Uh, no, sir.

21:53.378 --> 21:55.880
You see, I'm not Dutch,
I'm Dutch.

21:55.881 --> 21:58.883
I see.

21:58.884 --> 22:00.885
Call the MPs.

22:00.886 --> 22:02.888
The man is a loon.

22:04.890 --> 22:06.891
Well, I just came down
to get some formula.

22:06.892 --> 22:09.393
Where did you say
the refrigerator door was?

22:09.394 --> 22:10.895
Out there.

22:10.896 --> 22:12.396
Oh, fine.

22:12.397 --> 22:13.397
Good, I'll come with you.

22:13.398 --> 22:15.900
It's a perfect time
to clean the butter bin.

22:20.906 --> 22:22.406
I can't help it.

22:22.407 --> 22:24.909
I'm a little jealous.

22:24.910 --> 22:28.913
And I don't know what to do.

22:28.914 --> 22:30.915
Oh, Dutch.

22:30.916 --> 22:32.416
Do you...

22:32.417 --> 22:34.919
Do you love this guy?

22:34.920 --> 22:36.421
No.

22:37.923 --> 22:40.424
I just feel trapped, Dutch.

22:40.425 --> 22:42.927
I've never been
as close to anybody

22:42.928 --> 22:44.428
as I am to you.

22:44.429 --> 22:45.930
Before,

22:45.931 --> 22:47.932
when a guy got too close,
I always got scared.

22:47.933 --> 22:49.433
I always ran away.

22:49.434 --> 22:51.435
I've always been afraid
of being hurt.

22:51.436 --> 22:54.439
Of being dumped.

22:56.942 --> 22:58.943
Dutch?

22:58.944 --> 22:59.944
Why, Eunice...

22:59.945 --> 23:02.446
Oh.

23:02.447 --> 23:04.448
I love you so much, honey.

23:04.449 --> 23:07.451
I wish I could believe
that was true.

23:07.452 --> 23:08.953
It's true, darling.

23:08.954 --> 23:11.455
It's true, and I...

23:11.456 --> 23:13.958
I just hope you can forgive me.

23:13.959 --> 23:14.959
Oh, hey, hey.

23:14.960 --> 23:16.460
I'm so afraid.

23:16.461 --> 23:18.462
Hey, there, sweetheart,
everything'll be fine.

23:18.463 --> 23:20.464
Hey, it's okay.

23:20.465 --> 23:22.467
It's okay.

23:32.344 --> 23:34.478
