bring your mom back.

00:10.218 --> 00:11.386
- There's no way
to get to her.

00:11.428 --> 00:12.637
- I'm not going to give up.

00:12.679 --> 00:15.932
- All of these promises--
look where we are.

00:15.974 --> 00:18.351
- Sierra--it's not a name.

00:18.393 --> 00:21.062
It's a military call sign
for a woman I used to work for.

it's Maya Schmidt.

- That's Petra's mom.
[object thwacks]

00:27.861 --> 00:30.613
- Me and my mom didn't just
leave that base.

00:30.655 --> 00:32.240
We ran away.

00:32.282 --> 00:34.159
- Petra was worried
that they'd come after her.

00:34.200 --> 00:35.702
It must be from the base.

00:35.744 --> 00:37.871
- The clearing as we know it
is gone.

00:37.912 --> 00:39.330
- I talked to Ty.

00:39.372 --> 00:41.082
He said that we can regroup
at the fort.

00:41.124 --> 00:43.209
- You were attacked
by a raptor.

00:43.251 --> 00:44.669
I tried to stop the bleeding.

00:44.711 --> 00:45.795
- It's an Aurora.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.297
It goes to two
different places.

00:47.339 --> 00:48.840
- We got to get her
through the Aurora,

00:48.882 --> 00:49.966
maybe get her to a hospital.

00:50.008 --> 00:51.259
- Josh, you're
not going through!

00:51.301 --> 00:52.469

what date it is?

00:59.267 --> 01:02.187
- It's September 12, 2021.

01:02.228 --> 01:04.064

before the sinkhole.

order a beer.

like you need it.

01:33.218 --> 01:34.928
- [sighs]

01:34.969 --> 01:37.555
- You've been sitting here for
hours, staring out the window,

01:37.597 --> 01:40.934
eating literally everything
on my menu.

01:40.975 --> 01:42.227
- It's just nice
to eat something

01:42.268 --> 01:45.271
you don't have to catch.

01:45.313 --> 01:47.857
Anyway, thanks for the beer.

with it that easy.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.655
What is it?
Breakup?

01:53.697 --> 01:55.782

more complicated than that.

01:55.824 --> 01:58.702
It's not something
I can really explain.

01:58.743 --> 02:02.747

and I like that accent.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.207
So try me.

02:06.167 --> 02:08.628
- Well, let's just say, um...

02:08.670 --> 02:11.464
I used to live here,
and I took a trip.

02:11.506 --> 02:13.633
It wasn't my idea, but...

I gained a sense
of purpose there...

a pretty big burden

I know if Riley's okay.

03:11.983 --> 03:14.486
- I know this hurts.
I'm there, too, but...

03:14.527 --> 03:17.697
maybe we should just
calm down and make a plan.

03:17.739 --> 03:20.116

I'm all ears.

03:20.158 --> 03:23.536

our kids back, right?

03:23.578 --> 03:25.538
I figured the Aurora that Josh
and Riley went through

03:25.580 --> 03:27.332
maybe went to same place
Eve did.

03:29.084 --> 03:30.543
We have no idea where they are.

- I might know
someone who does--

03:32.337 --> 03:34.881
Maya Schmidt.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.884
- Even if she can help us,
we don't know how to find her.

03:37.926 --> 03:39.719
- Find the people
who are hunting her.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.554
They might have Maya
at their base.

base took Petra and Levi, okay?

04:00.156 --> 04:02.117
I'm going to where I lost her.

04:02.158 --> 04:04.202
If that Aurora comes back,
I have to be there.

We should be reflecting

us weeding the frickin' garden.

one with a bone to pick.

To the village, we're just
a bunch of new mouths to feed.

05:53.603 --> 05:56.898
And we--we don't have Ty
or Paara to plead our case.

05:56.940 --> 05:59.526
We actually have to step up,
and we got to show our worth.

And--and I'm worried
if we don't,

our kid here.

- Given the transverse fracture
and numerous contusions,

I'd say he fell,
from somewhere high up.

This tree would be
a strong candidate.

are you suggesting?

I don't see any of his weapons.

maybe we'll learn more

07:53.682 --> 07:55.475

Yeah, word is, she stabbed him
and threw him in a river.

the return of a killer?

Ah, I mean, on the other hand,
other cultures view the spiral

10:00.183 --> 10:02.977
as a winding journey,
so maybe this

10:03.019 --> 10:04.979

announcing the start

- According to who?

10:34.092 --> 10:35.510
- Ruth and
the Leadership Council.

10:35.552 --> 10:36.761
The gates are to stay closed

10:36.803 --> 10:38.763
until we find
who killed our warrior.

10:38.805 --> 10:40.390
- Look, I got no issue
with your council,

10:40.432 --> 10:42.934
but I got to get out there--
I'm trying to find my daughter.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.062
- I'd let you go, Sam,

10:46.104 --> 10:48.940
but I don't want an issue
with Ruth.

10:48.982 --> 10:51.443
- Get out of my way.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.993
- Hey!

11:00.035 --> 11:01.870
Hey, hey, get off him!

11:01.911 --> 11:04.831
[dramatic music]

11:04.873 --> 11:10.253
* *

11:14.299 --> 11:16.092
- Stop this now!

11:16.134 --> 11:19.346
- Hey, hey, we don't want
any trouble.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.431
- That's not what
it looks like.

11:21.473 --> 11:23.016
Take them to the cell!

11:23.058 --> 11:28.271
* *

11:28.313 --> 11:30.940
- What are you doing?
- Izz, I'm sorry.

11:30.982 --> 11:32.859
Hey, I'll fix it.

11:32.901 --> 11:35.904
* *

11:35.945 --> 11:38.782
- Don't lose your cool.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.785
This job will test you
in ways you can never imagine.

11:41.826 --> 11:44.537
You're going to want to scream,
yell, put your hair out.

11:44.579 --> 11:47.749
But what's my advice?
all: Don't lose your cool.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.125
- Exactly.

11:49.167 --> 11:50.794
Okay, I'll see everyone
tomorrow.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.879
- Bye.
[indistinct chatter]

11:52.921 --> 11:55.757
- Dr. Velez?

11:55.799 --> 11:58.468
- Can I help you?
- I hope so.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.136
My name's Dr. Ty Coleman

12:00.178 --> 12:02.931
and in the simplest of terms,

12:02.972 --> 12:04.849
there are people
who are in trouble,

12:04.891 --> 12:06.142
but I believe you can help.

12:06.184 --> 12:08.645
- Well, hang on.
Who's in trouble?

12:08.687 --> 12:10.146
- It's complicated.

12:10.188 --> 12:12.232
And, honestly, it will
be hard to believe,

12:12.273 --> 12:14.401
but I can prove it's worth
your time to listen.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.861
This is a list
of things that will happen

12:16.903 --> 12:20.323
in the next 24 hours, things
that haven't happened yet.

12:20.365 --> 12:21.950
- [exhales sharply]
What--

12:21.991 --> 12:23.827
what are you talking about?

12:23.868 --> 12:27.163
- There will be a mudslide
on the PCH this afternoon,

12:27.205 --> 12:29.332
a presidential assassination
in the Middle East,

12:29.374 --> 12:31.334
and Arsenal will score
against Liverpool

12:31.376 --> 12:33.920
in the 94th minute
and go on to win 1-0.

12:33.962 --> 12:36.548
- Buddy, are you feeling
all right?

12:38.383 --> 12:39.551
- I'll be waiting

12:39.592 --> 12:42.387
at the Sand Dollar Bar
later on today.

12:42.429 --> 12:46.099
When you're ready to listen,
I'll be ready to talk.

12:46.141 --> 12:49.269
* *

12:49.310 --> 12:51.396
- [sighs]

12:51.438 --> 12:57.819
* *

12:57.861 --> 12:59.904
[indistinct chatter]

12:59.946 --> 13:02.115
- [exhales sharply]

13:05.994 --> 13:07.203
[exhales sharply]

13:12.000 --> 13:14.169
[exhales sharply]
- Impressive.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.795
Good thing mammoths are big,

13:15.837 --> 13:18.131
because that's about the only
thing you're going to hit.

13:18.173 --> 13:19.966
- Thanks for the tip.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.227
[exhales sharply]
- Okay.

13:31.269 --> 13:33.063
Time for you to get
back to pulling weeds.

13:33.104 --> 13:34.230
- I'm good here, thanks.

13:34.272 --> 13:36.024
- You can be good
somewhere else.

13:36.066 --> 13:37.609
That's my bow.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.571
- You can have it
when I'm done.

13:41.613 --> 13:43.448
- You sure about that?

13:43.490 --> 13:45.075
I'm a warrior.

13:45.116 --> 13:47.410
And you clearly are not.

13:47.452 --> 13:48.912
- You don't even know my name,

13:48.953 --> 13:50.622
and you're already
insulting me.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.667
That's not fair.
- Haven't you figured it out?

13:53.708 --> 13:55.001
Life's not fair.

13:55.043 --> 14:01.591
* *

14:01.633 --> 14:04.052
See what I mean?

14:04.094 --> 14:06.596
- Leyla.

14:06.638 --> 14:08.932
What are you doing?

14:08.973 --> 14:12.435
- Just welcoming her
to our home.

14:12.477 --> 14:15.647
- Where I'm from, people
usually start with "hello."

14:15.689 --> 14:17.649
- You want to learn the bow?

14:17.691 --> 14:19.234
- Yes.

14:19.275 --> 14:22.946
- Then let one of our
best archers teach you--

14:22.987 --> 14:24.781
my daughter.

14:24.823 --> 14:26.241
- Me?

14:26.282 --> 14:28.326
- It'll be good
for both of you.

14:29.953 --> 14:32.580
We need to set
the example here.

14:32.622 --> 14:35.250
* *

14:35.291 --> 14:37.794
Are we understood?

14:37.836 --> 14:41.089
* *

14:41.131 --> 14:42.632
- We are.

14:42.674 --> 14:48.972
* *

14:49.014 --> 14:51.808
You don't get to hold that yet.

14:51.850 --> 14:53.518
Show me your stance.

14:53.560 --> 14:56.563
* *

14:56.604 --> 14:59.190
[scoffs]
This is gonna to take a while.

14:59.232 --> 15:02.485
* *

15:02.527 --> 15:04.446
- Ruth, where do
you want us to go?

15:04.487 --> 15:06.573
- Station at the front gate.
- Let's move.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.408
Okay.

15:08.450 --> 15:11.703
- Ruth, hey. I heard what
happened with Gavin and Sam.

15:11.745 --> 15:13.496
Considering what's
going on right now,

15:13.538 --> 15:15.832
I don't think locking up
our only two military guys

15:15.874 --> 15:18.251
is such a great idea...

15:18.293 --> 15:20.128
respectfully.

15:20.170 --> 15:22.005
- Do you know
how many years we've gone

15:22.047 --> 15:24.049
without an altercation
amongst our own?

15:24.090 --> 15:25.800
Two.

15:25.842 --> 15:29.679
You've been here for two days,
and we've already had a fight.

15:29.721 --> 15:31.514
Why do you think that is?

15:31.556 --> 15:33.224
- Ruth, I'm sure they're sorry.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.560
- I asked you a question.
What's your answer?

15:37.896 --> 15:40.357
- I don't know.
- I do.

15:40.398 --> 15:43.610
In this place, we value
community above all else.

15:43.651 --> 15:46.905
That's why we avoid
violent confrontation.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.032
Your people are different.

15:49.074 --> 15:51.201
You value the individual

15:51.242 --> 15:54.371
and punch whatever gets
in your way.

15:54.412 --> 15:56.623
That's not
how you build a society.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.625
- We haven't been a community
as long as you guys have.

15:58.667 --> 16:00.835
We're still learning,
but we're trying.

16:00.877 --> 16:02.671
- Well, you better try harder.

16:02.712 --> 16:04.589
[person screams]

16:04.631 --> 16:06.633
[body thuds]

16:06.675 --> 16:09.135
* *

16:09.177 --> 16:10.637
- Oh, my God.

16:10.679 --> 16:13.056
* *

16:13.098 --> 16:15.058
- What did this?

16:15.100 --> 16:18.061
[creatures screeching]

16:18.103 --> 16:24.150
* *

16:29.698 --> 16:29.906

[people screaming]

16:32.200 --> 16:34.953
[creatures screeching]

16:34.994 --> 16:38.164
- Archers to the East Wall!
Go, now!

16:38.206 --> 16:40.792
- Everyone else in the huts!
No one outside!

16:40.834 --> 16:42.877
[people screaming]

16:42.919 --> 16:44.337
- Uh, should I get a bow?

16:44.379 --> 16:46.381
- You know how to shoot?
- No, he doesn't.

16:46.423 --> 16:49.092
- Well, then get in a hut, now!

16:49.134 --> 16:51.511
I got to find Veronica.
- Oh, no.

16:51.553 --> 16:54.973
[creatures screech,
person screams]

16:55.015 --> 16:56.349
Go.

16:56.391 --> 16:59.310
[suspenseful music]

16:59.352 --> 17:00.937
* *

17:00.979 --> 17:02.522
- Hey.
Come with me.

17:02.564 --> 17:03.815
- We got to move, Izzy.
- Yeah, yeah.

17:03.857 --> 17:05.316
- Go!
- Let's go!

17:06.651 --> 17:08.403
- Go, go, go!

17:09.779 --> 17:12.907
[child whimpers]

17:12.949 --> 17:15.243
[creatures screeching]

17:15.285 --> 17:17.787
[panicked chatter]

17:17.829 --> 17:20.540
- I don't see Izzy anywhere.
Izzy!

17:20.582 --> 17:21.583
- Hey, open the door.
Let us out.

17:21.624 --> 17:22.751
Hey, open the door!
Let us out!

17:22.792 --> 17:24.669
- Will you stop?
You're not helping.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.713
You've caused enough
problems today.

17:26.755 --> 17:28.423
Try not to make it worse.

17:28.465 --> 17:30.175
- I was trying to get
back to my daughter.

17:30.216 --> 17:31.593
- Oh, yeah, and now
I can't get to mine.

17:31.634 --> 17:33.470
That turned out
great, didn't it?

17:33.511 --> 17:35.764
[creature screeching]

17:35.805 --> 17:37.932
- Aah!

17:37.974 --> 17:39.017
- I can't believe pterodactyls

17:39.059 --> 17:41.144
used to be
my favorite dinosaur.

17:41.186 --> 17:42.479
[creature screeches]

17:42.520 --> 17:44.105
Oh, God!

17:44.147 --> 17:47.609
[screeching continues]

17:47.650 --> 17:49.361
Izzy!

17:49.402 --> 17:52.364
[screeching continues]

17:52.405 --> 17:55.075
Okay, okay, we're good.

17:55.116 --> 18:01.289
* *

18:01.331 --> 18:02.791
[Izzy shouts]
Oh, no!

18:02.832 --> 18:04.292
No, no, no!

18:04.334 --> 18:06.628
- [screeching]

18:06.670 --> 18:08.672
- It's gonna be okay.
It's gonna be okay.

18:08.713 --> 18:10.090
- Hey!

18:10.131 --> 18:13.760
* *

18:13.802 --> 18:15.804
- [screeches]

18:15.845 --> 18:17.806
* *

18:17.847 --> 18:20.809
- It's gone.
You can come out now.

18:20.850 --> 18:24.646
[door creaking softly]

18:24.688 --> 18:28.316
[distant creature screeching]

18:28.358 --> 18:29.776
- Did you kill that thing?

18:29.818 --> 18:34.280
- Barely scratched it,
but enough to scare it off.

18:34.322 --> 18:37.325
- Did they all leave?
- For now.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.078
- Thank you.

18:40.120 --> 18:44.082
[indistinct chatter]

18:44.124 --> 18:46.084
[sighs]

18:46.126 --> 18:47.419
Let's go.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.879
[dramatic music]

18:49.921 --> 18:52.173
- Veronica!
Hey.

18:52.215 --> 18:56.261
* *

18:56.302 --> 18:58.263
- Oh. Oh.

18:58.304 --> 19:00.265
- Oh.

19:00.306 --> 19:02.600
- I was so worried about you.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.436
Oh.

19:04.477 --> 19:11.651
* *

19:11.693 --> 19:13.028
What is it?

19:13.069 --> 19:15.071
- I'll be--I'll be right back.

19:15.113 --> 19:18.074
Ruth, we need to talk.

19:18.116 --> 19:20.535
- What is it?

19:20.577 --> 19:21.703
- I kept my opinions to myself

19:21.745 --> 19:23.621
because I really want
to make this work.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.291
But you locked up two
of our best fighters,

19:26.332 --> 19:28.960
people who could have
really helped today.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.545
Seriously, Ruth, look around.

19:30.587 --> 19:32.505
What do you think happens
when those things come back?

19:32.547 --> 19:34.841
- My warriors
can defend our home.

19:34.883 --> 19:37.385
- Apparently not.

19:37.427 --> 19:40.055
You need our help,
and you know it.

19:40.096 --> 19:42.640
* *

19:42.682 --> 19:44.809
- Those creatures
may well return,

19:44.851 --> 19:47.270
and the last thing we need
is a dangerous distraction,

19:47.312 --> 19:49.189
like you and your friends.

19:49.230 --> 19:51.232
* *

19:51.274 --> 19:52.567
- Is that what you think of us?

19:52.609 --> 19:54.569
- Today I had to deal
with a public brawl,

19:54.611 --> 19:56.988
another conflict involving
my own daughter,

19:57.030 --> 20:01.034
and now you questioning
my authority in my own home,

20:01.076 --> 20:04.329
which is not yet yours.

20:04.371 --> 20:06.414
- I'm just trying to help
protect this place.

20:06.456 --> 20:08.917
- So am I...

20:08.958 --> 20:11.670
which is why,
as of this moment,

20:11.711 --> 20:13.755
I am confining all refugees

20:13.797 --> 20:15.590
from the Clearing
to the Long House

20:15.632 --> 20:16.758
until this crisis is over.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.468
- No, Ruth, you don't
have to do that.

20:18.510 --> 20:20.178
No, we can work
something else out.

20:20.220 --> 20:22.430
- No, I have wasted enough
time on this conversation.

20:22.472 --> 20:24.683
Either your people go
into the Long House,

20:24.724 --> 20:27.018
or you can all leave
our village.

20:27.060 --> 20:33.983
* *

20:36.653 --> 20:38.238
- Scott!

20:38.279 --> 20:40.115
You okay, dude?

20:40.156 --> 20:42.117
- Uh...getting there.

20:42.158 --> 20:43.743
- Yeah, um...

20:43.785 --> 20:45.286
there's something
you need to see.

20:45.328 --> 20:46.913
Come on.

20:46.955 --> 20:53.878
* *

20:56.756 --> 20:59.092
It's the same type of spiral
you found outside the fort,

20:59.134 --> 21:00.385
isn't it?

21:00.427 --> 21:03.013
* *

21:03.054 --> 21:06.307
- When I was a kid, I literally
read every dinosaur book

21:06.349 --> 21:07.976
in the library,

21:08.018 --> 21:10.395
and nobody
ever discovered this.

21:12.772 --> 21:17.360
But apparently pterodactyls
make these spirals.

21:17.402 --> 21:20.739
- Okay.

21:20.780 --> 21:23.533
But why would they do
that here?

21:23.575 --> 21:26.911
* *

21:32.584 --> 21:32.751
.

21:32.792 --> 21:33.251
[dramatic music]

21:35.378 --> 21:42.260
* *

21:42.302 --> 21:44.512
- You know you're supposed to
be in the Long House, right?

21:44.554 --> 21:47.140
- I'm good here, thanks.

21:47.182 --> 21:49.517
- Look, I get it--
you want to be a hero.

21:49.559 --> 21:51.686
That's why you saved that kid.

21:51.728 --> 21:54.522
It was pretty brave,
but mostly stupid.

21:54.564 --> 21:56.566
- How?
I saved her life.

21:56.608 --> 21:58.485
- No, I saved her.

21:58.526 --> 22:00.945
You ran her into a hut that was
being attacked by a dinosaur.

22:00.987 --> 22:03.365
- [scoffs] Look, I get
that you have issues,

22:03.406 --> 22:04.824
but don't take 'em out on me.

22:04.866 --> 22:06.201
- "Issues"?

22:06.242 --> 22:07.869
I'm not the one taking out
my anger on a hay bale.

22:07.911 --> 22:11.873
- You know what?
Yeah, I have issues, okay?

22:11.915 --> 22:13.917
I just lost my mother
and my brother,

22:13.958 --> 22:16.211
and today your mom
locked up my dad.

22:16.252 --> 22:19.005
* *

22:19.047 --> 22:22.300
Back home, I was as lost
and confused as anyone else.

22:22.342 --> 22:24.386
No one really understood me,

22:24.427 --> 22:27.889
but at least I had
people to talk to.

22:27.931 --> 22:30.517
Here, all we have time to do
is survive.

22:32.519 --> 22:35.605
What do you care?

22:35.647 --> 22:38.024
- You still have to go
to the Long House.

22:38.066 --> 22:44.989
* *

22:46.408 --> 22:48.993
- I told you--these people,
they're out to get us.

22:49.035 --> 22:51.913
- They're not out to get us.
- They put us in a pen.

22:51.955 --> 22:53.581
- Those flying monsters
come back,

22:53.623 --> 22:54.958
we're an all-you-can-
eat buffet.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.002
We need to do something.
- Yeah, we do.

22:57.043 --> 22:59.671
But I don't have a plan
right now, so just calm down.

22:59.713 --> 23:01.631
- Then what the hell
did we elect you leader for?

23:01.673 --> 23:04.384
- Guys, I think
I figured it out.

23:04.426 --> 23:07.470
The reason the pterodactyls
are making the spirals

23:07.512 --> 23:09.180
is because they're nesting.

23:09.222 --> 23:11.725
- Hold on. Why do you think
that they're nesting?

23:11.766 --> 23:13.935
- I knew those spirals
looked familiar,

23:13.977 --> 23:16.021
and then I remembered--
when I was a kid,

23:16.062 --> 23:19.399
I saw leatherback turtles
making shapes just like them.

23:19.441 --> 23:21.609
Well, smaller, of course,
but still...

23:21.651 --> 23:23.361
when the turtle colonies nest,

23:23.403 --> 23:25.488
they make spirals like these

23:25.530 --> 23:27.782
that cover whole sections
of the beach.

23:27.824 --> 23:29.367
- Okay, you think
that these things

23:29.409 --> 23:32.245
are turning the area around
the fort into a nesting colony?

23:32.287 --> 23:33.621
- Exactly.

23:33.663 --> 23:35.457
And they don't want
to share their home.

23:35.498 --> 23:37.208
- Okay, so what can we do?

23:37.250 --> 23:40.503
- What wildlife biologists
do all the time--

23:40.545 --> 23:42.297
give them an alternative.

23:42.339 --> 23:49.179
* *

23:56.227 --> 23:58.897
- I owe you an apology.
- Ah, forget it.

24:00.148 --> 24:02.650
- Now, look, I don't give
many of them.

24:02.692 --> 24:06.780
But in this case,
I really do owe you one.

24:09.282 --> 24:13.578
- I know what happened
isn't what you wanted, okay?

24:16.081 --> 24:18.333
- I understand what
you're going through.

24:18.375 --> 24:20.752
I know what it's like to want
to be there for your daughter

24:20.794 --> 24:22.545
and you can't help her.

24:22.587 --> 24:25.882
- All I'm trying to do
is fix things.

24:25.924 --> 24:29.427
- Well, maybe she doesn't want
you to fix anything right now.

24:29.469 --> 24:31.304
Riley...

24:31.346 --> 24:35.100
[scoffs] She hated when
I tried to fix her problems.

24:35.141 --> 24:39.604
She said the best thing to do
was just listen.

24:39.646 --> 24:43.149
But I didn't.

24:43.191 --> 24:44.943
I couldn't change.

24:47.237 --> 24:49.197
Before I fell down
that sinkhole,

24:49.239 --> 24:50.824
I was a different guy.

24:50.865 --> 24:52.951
I was stubborn.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.536
I mean, if someone told me

24:54.577 --> 24:56.788
something that wasn't
in my worldview,

24:56.830 --> 24:58.915
I shut it out.

24:58.957 --> 25:01.584
It was easier that way.

25:01.626 --> 25:03.878
But now I'm thinking everything
would have been better

25:03.920 --> 25:05.797
had I just taken
Riley's advice.

25:05.839 --> 25:08.967
* *

25:09.009 --> 25:12.721
I mean, if she was here...

25:12.762 --> 25:14.806
I wanted to take her fishing,

25:14.848 --> 25:17.017
'cause for years,

25:17.058 --> 25:20.228
she'd asked me to teach her.

25:20.270 --> 25:22.731
I never found the time.

25:23.940 --> 25:26.526
I thought being stuck
in 10,000 B.C.,

25:26.568 --> 25:28.903
we'd have time.

25:28.945 --> 25:31.448
Now we don't even have that.

25:31.489 --> 25:34.534
- Sam, I'm sorry.

25:34.576 --> 25:38.246
* *

25:38.288 --> 25:41.207
[seagulls crying]

25:45.962 --> 25:48.214
- How the hell
did you know all this?

25:48.256 --> 25:50.550
- I promise, I will talk you
through all of it,

25:50.592 --> 25:51.885
step by step.

25:51.926 --> 25:53.762
First, why don't
we get you a drink?

25:53.803 --> 25:57.098
Glenlivet 18, neat, right?

25:57.140 --> 25:58.933
- Enough with this
fortune-teller crap.

25:58.975 --> 26:00.852
Just tell me what
this is about.

26:02.312 --> 26:05.815
- [sighs] In three weeks,
a giant sinkhole

26:05.857 --> 26:08.026
will open
near the La Brea Tar Pits

26:08.068 --> 26:10.987
and swallow a chunk
of midtown Los Angeles.

26:11.029 --> 26:13.698
- A sinkhole?
- Yes, but it's more than that.

26:13.740 --> 26:15.909
It's a portal
that will take people,

26:15.950 --> 26:18.536
including you and me,

26:18.578 --> 26:20.830
to the year 10,000 B.C..

26:20.872 --> 26:24.084
- That's insane.
- Yeah, we thought so, too.

26:24.125 --> 26:26.795
But we came to see the truth.

26:26.836 --> 26:28.463
I managed to escape,

26:28.505 --> 26:30.799
but we have friends
who are still down there.

26:30.840 --> 26:32.509
I want to bring them back.

26:32.550 --> 26:35.220
- [scoffs] And you expect me
to believe all that?

26:35.261 --> 26:37.389
- Yes, I do,
because it's the truth.

26:37.430 --> 26:38.723
- It's impossible.

26:38.765 --> 26:40.892
- But I showed you
the news reports.

26:40.934 --> 26:44.020
I showed you the scores.
- Oh, it's some kind of trick.

26:46.189 --> 26:48.191
- I know you're getting
a divorce.

26:48.233 --> 26:53.988
* *

26:54.030 --> 26:56.491
- What did you say?
- I'm sorry.

26:56.533 --> 26:58.284
I know this is a lot,

26:58.326 --> 27:00.829
but I'm just trying to show you
that this is real.

27:00.870 --> 27:03.998
I know that your wife
gave you divorce papers--

27:04.040 --> 27:05.875
you probably have
them on you right now,

27:05.917 --> 27:07.669
and that you haven't told
anyone about it.

27:07.711 --> 27:10.338
I know that you have PTSD,

27:10.380 --> 27:12.549
that you're secretly
on medication.

27:12.590 --> 27:15.844
I know you think Riley is
in pre-med, but she quit.

27:15.885 --> 27:18.138
She isn't going
to tell you for weeks.

27:18.179 --> 27:20.473
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm your friend...

27:20.515 --> 27:23.309
just like our many friends that
we need to try and get back.

27:23.351 --> 27:25.145
* *

27:25.186 --> 27:26.855
I can't do that on my own.

27:26.896 --> 27:31.317
* *

27:31.359 --> 27:34.863
The only lead I have
is a secret Air Force project,

27:34.904 --> 27:36.865
and a woman named Maya Schmidt.

27:36.906 --> 27:38.700
But I need help
finding out more.

27:38.742 --> 27:40.160
I need you.

27:40.201 --> 27:42.746
I don't have anyone else
to turn to.

27:42.787 --> 27:46.082
There's no one else I trust.

27:46.124 --> 27:48.877
- [scoffs] I don't know
what your game is,

27:48.918 --> 27:50.754
but you stay away from me.

27:50.795 --> 27:52.672
I never want to hear
from you again.

27:52.714 --> 27:55.800
* *

27:55.842 --> 27:57.969
- [sighs]

28:03.475 --> 28:03.892
.

28:03.933 --> 28:04.684
- Just give me a minute, okay?

28:06.686 --> 28:08.438
- Why aren't you
in the Long House?

28:08.480 --> 28:10.690
- Because we have a way to stop
the dinosaurs from attacking.

28:10.732 --> 28:13.485
- I put your people in there
to stay out of our way,

28:13.526 --> 28:16.279
and already you disobey me.

28:16.321 --> 28:19.532
- Look, I spoke out against you
because I was afraid, okay?

28:19.574 --> 28:22.494
I was worried about Veronica
and our child

28:22.535 --> 28:24.454
and everybody else here.

28:26.581 --> 28:28.708
But I was wrong.

28:28.750 --> 28:31.211
Ruth, I'm just trying to
protect the people that I love.

28:31.252 --> 28:33.171
I mean, you have
a daughter, right?

28:33.213 --> 28:35.715
Isn't that something
you--you understand?

28:35.757 --> 28:38.426
[dramatic music]

28:38.468 --> 28:39.886
- So what is the plan?

28:39.928 --> 28:41.971
- First thing we're
going to need to do is,

28:42.013 --> 28:43.932
we're going to need to let
Gavin and Sam out of jail.

28:43.973 --> 28:46.059
- We have been over this.
- Yes, I realize that.

28:46.101 --> 28:48.144
But you don't know
these men like I do.

28:48.186 --> 28:50.480
They've both lost family
members in the last few days.

28:50.522 --> 28:53.817
They're acting out of grief,
and they want to help.

28:53.858 --> 28:55.568
Please.

28:55.610 --> 29:00.907
* *

29:00.949 --> 29:03.451
- Don't worry.
It's a simple two-part process.

29:03.493 --> 29:05.829
The first part is building
the new nest.

29:05.870 --> 29:07.247
- Which Sam and Veronica
are on top of.

29:07.288 --> 29:09.541
- And our part--
- Moving the egg?

29:09.582 --> 29:11.376
- Right.

29:11.418 --> 29:15.005
And one of them, I believe,
is buried

29:15.046 --> 29:18.591
right under...

29:18.633 --> 29:20.927
this mound of dirt.

29:20.969 --> 29:22.470
- Okay, let's start digging.

29:22.512 --> 29:23.763
Come on.

29:23.805 --> 29:25.265
- And you believe
you can convince

29:25.306 --> 29:26.808
a 60-million-year-old dinosaur

29:26.850 --> 29:28.643
it's just better off
somewhere else?

29:28.685 --> 29:30.812
- Well, it's not like
I met Mama out for coffee

29:30.854 --> 29:32.814
and asked her
about her dream home,

29:32.856 --> 29:34.733
but, theoretically,
it should work.

29:34.774 --> 29:36.609
- Don't think, just dig.

29:36.651 --> 29:43.825
* *

29:52.334 --> 29:55.295
- I never imagined myself
holding a dino egg.

29:55.337 --> 29:57.297
Why isn't there a camera
when you need one?

29:57.339 --> 29:59.132
- Hey, we can make
a TikTok later.

29:59.174 --> 30:00.967
Put it in the bag,
and let's go.

30:01.009 --> 30:03.970
- Come on, Scott, come on.

30:04.012 --> 30:05.513
- Okay, move.

30:05.555 --> 30:12.520
* *

30:16.274 --> 30:18.276
- Judah!

30:18.318 --> 30:19.903
Work faster!

30:19.944 --> 30:21.988
- We need to be done
with this spiral

30:22.030 --> 30:24.157
before that egg gets here.

30:24.199 --> 30:26.326
- Motherhood's made you mean.

30:26.368 --> 30:27.786
- Oh, yeah?

30:27.827 --> 30:30.622
If you don't keep working,
I can get a lot meaner.

30:30.663 --> 30:33.208
- While the Sky People attempt
to relocate the dinosaurs,

30:33.249 --> 30:35.001
we need to protect our home.

30:35.043 --> 30:37.921
- Warriors, take positions.

30:37.962 --> 30:42.425
* *

30:42.467 --> 30:44.010
- Take this.

30:44.052 --> 30:46.304
When you shoot, keep your back
straight and your elbow high.

30:46.346 --> 30:48.682
- So you're training me now?

30:48.723 --> 30:51.184
- What you said about people
not getting you--

30:51.226 --> 30:53.520
they don't always
get me either.

30:53.561 --> 30:55.105
Want to learn the bow,

30:55.146 --> 30:58.024
I'll teach you
anything you want.

30:58.066 --> 31:00.819
- Thanks.
- As long as you don't die.

31:00.860 --> 31:02.904
- [scoffs]
- [chuckles]

31:04.739 --> 31:06.700
- [exhales sharply]

31:06.741 --> 31:12.622
* *

31:12.664 --> 31:14.124
- How much farther?

31:14.165 --> 31:21.297
* *

31:21.339 --> 31:23.008
Whoa.

31:23.049 --> 31:26.219
- That's a Huey...

31:26.261 --> 31:30.265
same type that took
Levi and Petra.

31:30.306 --> 31:32.726
- It's got to belong
to that base we're looking for.

31:32.767 --> 31:34.561
- Yeah.

31:34.602 --> 31:38.565
[creatures screeching]

31:38.606 --> 31:40.108
We've been spotted.

31:40.150 --> 31:42.777

31:42.819 --> 31:44.571
- Uh, new plan--hide.

31:44.612 --> 31:46.865
* *

31:46.906 --> 31:49.993
[screeching continues]

31:51.870 --> 31:54.664
- Barrels twisted.
Weapon's no use.

31:54.706 --> 31:59.085
* *

31:59.127 --> 32:00.462
- No weapons here either.

32:00.503 --> 32:03.131
- Okay, we're going to have
to fight our way out.

32:03.173 --> 32:04.924
- Uh, with what?

32:04.966 --> 32:06.426
Have you guys seen
"Jurassic Park"?

32:06.468 --> 32:08.261
We need something substantial.

32:08.303 --> 32:10.513
- Okay, if we have
no offensive weapons,

32:10.555 --> 32:13.600
maybe we deploy
defensive ones...

32:13.641 --> 32:15.226
set off some flares.

32:15.268 --> 32:17.771
If we start this chopper,
we can shoot them off.

32:17.812 --> 32:21.107
* *

32:21.149 --> 32:23.485
[electronic humming]
Yeah!

32:23.526 --> 32:24.778
- Ha!

32:24.819 --> 32:26.946
I guess we have some luck.

32:26.988 --> 32:29.699
[electricity crackling]

32:29.741 --> 32:31.910
[engine dies]

32:31.951 --> 32:35.747
- [breathing heavily]
Or not.

32:35.789 --> 32:39.000
[screeching continues]

32:45.423 --> 32:45.632
.

32:45.674 --> 32:46.383
- Now that plan B's failed,

32:47.592 --> 32:49.219
someone please tell me
they've got a plan C.

32:49.260 --> 32:50.595
- We stick with plan B.

32:50.637 --> 32:52.764
- Whoa, whoa, didn't
the chopper just fritz out?

32:52.806 --> 32:54.974
- But all we need is a spark
to set off those flares.

32:55.016 --> 32:56.559
- You want to hot-wire it.
- Exactly.

32:56.601 --> 32:58.436
We just need a battery
that's still got some juice.

32:58.478 --> 33:00.355
There should be one
under the hood.

33:00.397 --> 33:02.607
- On it.

33:02.649 --> 33:04.734
- Okay, I need you
to find me some wires.

33:04.776 --> 33:06.277
I'm going to set up the flares.

33:06.319 --> 33:09.155
Let's go try and scare
off some dinosaurs.

33:09.197 --> 33:12.617
[dramatic music]

33:12.659 --> 33:16.037
[creatures screeching]

33:16.079 --> 33:23.003
* *

33:23.044 --> 33:24.796
- Got it.

33:24.838 --> 33:28.299
* *

33:28.341 --> 33:29.926
- Scott.

33:29.968 --> 33:32.762
[screeching continues]

33:32.804 --> 33:34.848
Clear.

33:34.889 --> 33:37.684
* *

33:37.726 --> 33:39.686
- Do we need anything else?
- Oh, yeah.

33:39.728 --> 33:42.272
Just some luck that this thing
doesn't explode.

33:42.313 --> 33:44.607
- Now or never.

33:44.649 --> 33:51.656
* *

33:51.698 --> 33:54.743
[screeching continues]

33:54.784 --> 34:00.165
* *

34:00.206 --> 34:02.917
It worked.
- [laughs]

34:02.959 --> 34:07.630
- We should go.
- We should go.

34:07.672 --> 34:10.842
This is when we run, Scott.
- Yep. Okay.

34:10.884 --> 34:17.974
* *

34:18.016 --> 34:19.726
Better be finished
making that nest!

34:19.768 --> 34:21.102
- We are.

34:22.645 --> 34:24.272
- Tell me a bunch
of angry pterodactyls

34:24.314 --> 34:26.358
aren't about to burst through
those trees and kill us.

34:26.399 --> 34:29.069
- Not if we move quickly.

34:29.110 --> 34:30.236
Come on.

34:30.278 --> 34:32.864
* *

34:32.906 --> 34:34.866
Come on.

34:34.908 --> 34:36.826
Good, good, good.

34:36.868 --> 34:38.995
Here, here.

34:39.037 --> 34:42.123
[creatures screeching]

34:42.165 --> 34:44.209
- Sounds like our friends
are on their way.

34:44.250 --> 34:45.669
- We good, Scott?
- Uh, yeah.

34:45.710 --> 34:48.046
- Come on!
[creatures screech]

34:48.088 --> 34:49.964
- Come on, come on.
- Go, go!

34:50.006 --> 34:51.883
- Veronica?
- Yeah.

34:51.925 --> 34:54.719
[screeching continues]

34:54.761 --> 35:01.601
* *

35:16.282 --> 35:20.328
[all cawing]

35:20.370 --> 35:22.914
- Eat your heart out,
Michael Crichton.

35:22.956 --> 35:29.337
* *

35:29.379 --> 35:32.340
[laughter, indistinct chatter]

35:32.382 --> 35:35.593
[upbeat percussion playing]

35:35.635 --> 35:40.473
* *

35:40.515 --> 35:42.851
- We're still
at separate tables.

35:42.892 --> 35:45.812
You'd think
after we saved their asses,

35:45.854 --> 35:48.523
they'd want to at least
have a meal with us.

35:48.565 --> 35:50.066
- Hmm.

35:50.108 --> 35:52.110
Maybe...
[sniffs]

35:52.152 --> 35:53.778
They think we need a shower.

35:53.820 --> 35:57.615
- Maybe they'll always be
suspicious of outsiders.

35:57.657 --> 36:01.786
- It's not your fault,
just--just human nature.

36:04.414 --> 36:07.125
This is for you

36:07.167 --> 36:09.878
for a job well done.

36:09.919 --> 36:14.591
It's something
very important to me, but...

36:14.632 --> 36:16.926
I wanted to give it to you

36:16.968 --> 36:19.095
as a token of my appreciation.

36:19.137 --> 36:23.183
[soft music]

36:23.224 --> 36:24.642
- It's a rocket.

36:24.684 --> 36:26.895
- How did you get this?
- Yeah.

36:26.936 --> 36:29.481
- It was my grandfather's.

36:29.522 --> 36:32.108
He was a Sky Person, like you,

36:32.150 --> 36:34.778
from the 1960s.

36:34.819 --> 36:36.988
He was one
of the first outsiders

36:37.030 --> 36:39.949
to join this community.

36:39.991 --> 36:44.579
We're a lot more alike
than you think.

36:44.621 --> 36:46.623
Anyway...

36:46.664 --> 36:47.957
thank you.

36:50.043 --> 36:51.252
- You're welcome.

36:51.294 --> 36:58.426
* *

37:09.854 --> 37:12.941
- What are you doing?
It's not even my birthday.

37:12.982 --> 37:16.486
- Yeah, I, uh--
Listen...

37:16.528 --> 37:19.781
I'm a terrible person.

37:19.823 --> 37:22.033
I'm sorry.

37:22.075 --> 37:24.244
- You're forgiven.

37:27.247 --> 37:30.750
- [sighs] So mint
chocolate chip ice cream

37:30.792 --> 37:35.255
is surprisingly hard to come by
in 10,000 B.C.,

37:35.296 --> 37:37.382
but these corn cakes--

37:37.424 --> 37:39.801
well, apparently
they're to die for.

37:43.430 --> 37:45.515
You gonna make a wish?

37:48.518 --> 37:55.650
* *

37:57.610 --> 37:59.946
So I was thinking that, uh,

37:59.988 --> 38:03.324
tomorrow maybe you and I could
go for a walk...

38:03.366 --> 38:05.785
two of us.

38:05.827 --> 38:09.414
You can, you know, tell me
whatever you want to tell me.

38:09.456 --> 38:12.334
- I'd like that.

38:12.375 --> 38:14.127
- Okay.

38:14.169 --> 38:21.301
* *

38:22.302 --> 38:25.472
[excited chatter]

38:32.228 --> 38:34.939
- Sam, hey, hold up.

38:34.981 --> 38:37.108
I know you're going out there
to get Riley back,

38:37.150 --> 38:39.235
but there's something
you got to see first.

38:39.277 --> 38:41.321
- I've been held up all day.
I got to get moving.

38:41.363 --> 38:43.198
- Hey, hey, just a minute,
just a minute.

38:43.239 --> 38:45.742
I went back out to the chopper,
and I got the tail number.

38:45.784 --> 38:47.952
- So what?

38:47.994 --> 38:50.455
- It's from
Ladera Air Force Base.

38:50.497 --> 38:52.290
Sam, that's in Los Angeles.

38:52.332 --> 38:54.626
If it's in the same place
it was up there,

38:54.668 --> 38:57.629
then I can find it down here.

38:57.671 --> 39:01.508
It could help bring Riley back.

39:01.549 --> 39:04.969
Hey, you told me earlier
you're a different man now,

39:05.011 --> 39:07.430
that you knew how to listen
when it mattered.

39:07.472 --> 39:09.099
Prove it.

39:09.140 --> 39:11.893
If we go to that base,
maybe we find Maya Schmidt.

39:11.935 --> 39:13.019
- [sighs]

39:13.061 --> 39:15.397
- Maybe she has
the answers we need.

39:15.438 --> 39:17.941
- [scoffs]

39:17.982 --> 39:20.068
All right, I'm in.

39:21.486 --> 39:22.862
- Good.

39:22.904 --> 39:25.865
[dramatic music]

39:25.907 --> 39:29.744
* *

39:43.299 --> 39:46.928
- Hey. So I spoke to Riley
about her pre-med program.

39:46.970 --> 39:48.179
[door closes]

39:48.221 --> 39:50.348
She denied it at first,
but you were right.

39:50.390 --> 39:52.142
She dropped out,
just like you said.

39:52.183 --> 39:54.686
I also had a military buddy
of mine look into that woman

39:54.728 --> 39:56.563
that you mentioned--
Maya Schmidt.

39:56.604 --> 39:58.231
He found a connection
between her

39:58.273 --> 40:00.692
and a top-secret military
program on quantum physics

40:00.734 --> 40:04.112
being run out
of Ladera Air Force Base.

40:04.154 --> 40:06.865
- Can I make the assumption
you believe me now?

40:06.906 --> 40:09.034
- Let's just say,
at the very least,

40:09.075 --> 40:10.702
you've got my attention.

40:10.744 --> 40:13.580
- I'm very grateful to have it.

40:13.621 --> 40:17.459
Now that I do,
what would you say is next?

40:18.918 --> 40:20.712
- I think we need
to find someone

40:20.754 --> 40:22.964
who knows more
about that program.

40:25.759 --> 40:28.553
- I think I know exactly
who we can talk to.

40:30.096 --> 40:33.016
[siren wailing]

40:35.643 --> 40:38.605
[indistinct chatter
over police radio]

40:46.446 --> 40:48.239
- Who the hell are you two?

40:48.281 --> 40:52.077
* *

40:52.118 --> 40:53.495
Why'd you bail me out?

40:53.536 --> 40:56.122
* *

40:56.164 --> 40:59.084
- Perhaps we can discuss
that over a coffee.

40:59.125 --> 41:03.797
* *
