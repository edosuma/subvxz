WEBVTT

03:03.892 --> 03:06.101
Do you like that?

04:08.581 --> 04:11.375
Oh, Harry.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.337
Josie.

04:15.546 --> 04:17.631
Yes.

04:17.799 --> 04:21.802
Yes, it's me.

04:22.470 --> 04:24.137
I'm here.

04:24.347 --> 04:29.685
- Josie.
- Harry, I'm here.

04:30.895 --> 04:32.729
Josie...

05:45.094 --> 05:46.636
Room service.

05:46.804 --> 05:49.431
Come on in. It's open.

05:53.394 --> 05:55.729
You can just put it on the table.

05:56.731 --> 05:57.856
Audrey.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.524
I trust your sleep was untroubled?

05:59.692 --> 06:01.777
Here at The Great Northern,
we aim to make your stay

06:01.944 --> 06:05.405
as comfortable
and as enjoyable as possible.

06:05.573 --> 06:09.576
You know, we take the concept
of room service very seriously.

06:10.119 --> 06:11.286
Oh.

06:13.289 --> 06:14.623
Do you remember
your grandfather?

06:14.832 --> 06:15.874
Mm-hm.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.918
Colorful man,
one of the wisest I ever met.

06:18.252 --> 06:19.836
You know what he once said?

06:20.004 --> 06:23.006
He said if you're gonna bring
a hammer, you better bring nails.

06:24.217 --> 06:26.009
What's that supposed to mean?

06:26.177 --> 06:28.345
What that means is the next time
you come into my room

06:28.513 --> 06:30.389
and carry on,
you'd better be ready to finish

06:30.556 --> 06:32.057
whatever it is you came here to start.

06:34.394 --> 06:37.145
- Maybe I'm ready now.
- Then be yourself.

06:38.064 --> 06:40.899
I am being myself.

06:42.652 --> 06:43.902
You're right.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.695
You're absolutely right.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.448
I stand corrected. You're a beautiful,
intelligent young woman.

06:50.660 --> 06:51.701
What else?

06:52.120 --> 06:53.453
Uh...

06:54.038 --> 06:58.333
You have an undeniable
magic about you

06:59.085 --> 07:02.003
that inspires a plan.

07:03.005 --> 07:04.673
Flight at sunset and dinner for two?

07:05.633 --> 07:08.135
- When?
- What, the flight or the sunset?

07:08.803 --> 07:12.097
Well, I have to go to the library and
have a meeting with my father later.

07:12.306 --> 07:14.057
A simple yes or no would do.

07:16.060 --> 07:17.102
Yes.

07:22.483 --> 07:26.194
And if you bring a hammer,
you better bring some nails too.

07:39.167 --> 07:41.126
Anything?

07:41.294 --> 07:45.130
No, not a word. She wants to speak
to the South African consulate.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.591
In Twin Peaks?

07:48.426 --> 07:51.303
Why would Eckhardt want me dead?

07:51.721 --> 07:54.389
Sexual jealousy.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.600
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm-hm.

07:56.767 --> 07:58.310
It's good to have you back, Harry.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.770
Taken me a day
or so to get my sea legs.

08:00.938 --> 08:03.440
Well, to be honest, it looks like
you went down with the ship.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.108
Why don't you go home
and recuperate?

08:05.276 --> 08:08.945
No, all I need is some coffee,
maybe a little food.

08:09.113 --> 08:11.281
Sure-fire cure for a hangover, Harry.

08:11.449 --> 08:14.075
You take a glass of nearly frozen,
unstrained tomato juice.

08:14.243 --> 08:16.578
You plop a couple of oysters in there,
you drink it down.

08:16.746 --> 08:17.787
Breathe deeply.

08:17.955 --> 08:20.332
Next, you take a mound,
and I mean a mound, of sweetbreads,

08:20.500 --> 08:22.709
sautÃ© them with some chestnuts
and some Canadian bacon.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.419
Finally, biscuits.

08:24.587 --> 08:26.505
Big biscuits, smothered in gravy.

08:26.672 --> 08:29.424
Now, here's where it gets tricky.
You're gonna need some anchovies...

08:29.592 --> 08:31.718
Excuse me.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.140
That should do it.

08:41.229 --> 08:44.606
The bonsai. The ultimate miniature.

08:45.316 --> 08:48.109
Bicarbonate of soda,
the ultimate digestive aid.

08:51.155 --> 08:54.699
Harry, quaff in good health.

08:55.660 --> 08:57.369
- Thank you.
- Mm.

09:01.207 --> 09:03.833
Where the hell did that come from?

09:04.585 --> 09:06.419
It was delivered this morning.

09:13.594 --> 09:14.970
It's from Josie.

09:17.056 --> 09:20.392
Harry, Windom Earle
was at my house.

09:22.895 --> 09:26.106
Windom Earle. When?

09:26.274 --> 09:29.943
Yesterday. He left this with Donna.

09:31.529 --> 09:34.072
He's closing in, Harry.

09:34.532 --> 09:37.659
Knight to King Bishop 3.
What do we do?

09:37.827 --> 09:39.744
We publish our next move today.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.871
Thanks, Lucy.

09:42.039 --> 09:43.456
Brace yourself, Harry.

09:43.624 --> 09:46.167
- Agent Dale Cooper.
- Gordon Cole.

09:46.335 --> 09:48.211
Sure sorry to interrupt you fellas.

09:48.379 --> 09:50.839
But, Coop, I'm bringing you
the classified portion

09:51.007 --> 09:53.800
of the Windom Earle dossier.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.218
Back from Bend?

09:55.386 --> 09:56.803
Been on over to Bend, Oregon.

09:56.971 --> 09:59.472
Whole lot of shaking
going on down in Bend.

10:01.767 --> 10:04.269
Enter Gordon Cole.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.650
This is so galling, Leo.

10:10.818 --> 10:15.030
Young Dale is continually refusing
to play fair!

10:15.531 --> 10:17.324
When Earle went boi-oi-oing,

10:17.491 --> 10:20.493
the doctors discovered
he was on haloperidol.

10:20.661 --> 10:23.246
The same drug the one-armed man,
Gerard, was on.

10:23.914 --> 10:26.666
- What's that?
- Gerard used the same drug.

10:26.834 --> 10:27.876
You got it.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.420
But they figured he was using
the drug to fake his illness,

10:30.588 --> 10:32.213
just as you suspected, Coop.

10:32.381 --> 10:34.716
Definite schizoid maneuvering.

10:40.139 --> 10:42.390
"Project Blue Book"?

10:42.558 --> 10:44.392
My God, Gordon,
what was he doing on this?

10:44.560 --> 10:48.396
The Bureau loaned Earle out
to the Air Force in 1965.

10:48.564 --> 10:51.941
Reports on his two-year hitch
are blacked out. National security.

10:52.109 --> 10:53.151
Wait a minute.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.362
Earle was investigating UFOs?

10:55.821 --> 10:57.572
Major Briggs, Harry.

10:57.740 --> 11:00.575
Gordon, there are some
curious linkages here.

11:00.743 --> 11:03.828
The word "linkage"
reminds me of sausage.

11:04.038 --> 11:07.374
Never cared much for the links,
preferred the patties.

11:07.541 --> 11:10.919
But breakfast is a real good idea.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.128
Bonsai.

11:12.296 --> 11:14.798
Remember those
old World War II movies?

11:14.965 --> 11:16.466
Bonsai!

11:18.010 --> 11:19.427
Damnation!

11:24.600 --> 11:27.686
Good to see you again, doc.
Sheriff, we'll be riding with you.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.062
Cruiser's right outside.

11:29.230 --> 11:30.772
Hold it one second there, Coop.

11:30.940 --> 11:33.108
You'd better dust off
your own black suit.

11:33.275 --> 11:35.318
With Windom Earle
rolling around loose on the deck,

11:35.486 --> 11:37.237
we need you back on the team.

11:37.405 --> 11:38.905
What are you saying, Gordon?

11:39.073 --> 11:41.574
Coop, it gives me great pleasure
to reinstate you

11:41.742 --> 11:45.328
into the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.

11:47.415 --> 11:50.375
Brand-new issue,
more accurate and efficient.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.585
Smith & Wesson, ten millimeter.

11:52.753 --> 11:56.673
Model 1076, all stainless steel.

11:56.841 --> 12:00.343
It's a beautiful weapon, Coop,
and it's all yours.

12:00.511 --> 12:01.886
Thank you, Gordon.

12:02.054 --> 12:05.849
Cooper, we're gonna find Earle.
We will pursue,

12:06.016 --> 12:09.352
- capture and incarcerate.
- Capture and incarcerate.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.938
Let's hit the road.

12:14.775 --> 12:16.568
Come on, buster, I'm buying.

12:16.736 --> 12:19.070
On your tail, Gordon.

12:21.198 --> 12:23.324
Now, Leo...

12:26.954 --> 12:28.163
...pick three cards.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.588
One,

12:37.173 --> 12:39.299
two,

12:40.009 --> 12:42.260
three.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.638
Queen Donna.

12:48.267 --> 12:51.561
Queen Audrey.

12:52.605 --> 12:55.190
Queen Shelly, good.

12:56.650 --> 13:00.862
Now, see if you can find the king.

13:09.163 --> 13:10.246
Little Dale.

13:11.499 --> 13:15.543
Now, we need one more queen.

13:16.337 --> 13:18.087
Let's see.

13:19.298 --> 13:21.674
The queen of hearts.

13:22.718 --> 13:23.760
Let me see.

13:25.346 --> 13:27.096
Miss Twin Peaks.

13:27.640 --> 13:31.684
Now, what do you get if you win?
You get a dozen roses,

13:31.894 --> 13:34.979
a scholarship to the college
of your choice,

13:35.147 --> 13:37.774
the accolades of your peers...

13:37.942 --> 13:39.609
Oh, yes, I know.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.737
You get to die.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.158
A royal execution.

13:50.663 --> 13:53.331
And Cooper

13:56.418 --> 13:58.878
gets to watch.

14:49.513 --> 14:51.097
Hello, Ben.

14:52.099 --> 14:54.392
I need to talk to you.

15:09.617 --> 15:10.700
How was everything, sir?

15:13.662 --> 15:15.872
Unbelievable.

15:19.376 --> 15:22.253
- Is Audrey Horne here?
- She's in the back. I'll get her for you.

15:22.463 --> 15:23.546
Thanks.

15:24.006 --> 15:25.256
Donna, hi.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.217
Hi, Donna.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.637
Hi.

15:33.891 --> 15:36.100
- Hi, Donna.
- Hi.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.478
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

15:40.397 --> 15:43.483
This might sound a little strange.

15:43.859 --> 15:44.901
What?

15:45.235 --> 15:49.113
Would you know any reason
why my mom's visiting your dad?

15:49.949 --> 15:51.282
Not offhand.

15:52.493 --> 15:57.372
Okay, well, yesterday he came by
the house to see my mom.

15:57.539 --> 15:59.666
And today she drove over here
to see him.

16:00.084 --> 16:02.669
Maybe she's just helping him
with the Stop Ghostwood campaign.

16:02.836 --> 16:06.214
No, she would have said something
to me, and she hasn't said a word.

16:08.759 --> 16:10.593
Is she here now?

16:10.803 --> 16:12.929
They're in his office together.

16:17.601 --> 16:20.144
No, I won't accept them.

16:20.312 --> 16:21.771
They're your letters.

16:22.398 --> 16:23.773
They were written to you.

16:23.941 --> 16:25.274
I don't want them.

16:25.442 --> 16:28.528
I won't have them
in my house any longer.

16:28.696 --> 16:31.280
You've had them for 20 years.

16:31.448 --> 16:33.116
Why now?

16:33.283 --> 16:36.202
That's just what I'm asking you.
Why now?

16:36.370 --> 16:39.706
They'll only succeed
in ripping apart old wounds.

16:39.873 --> 16:42.375
I can't bear the thought of it.

16:45.504 --> 16:46.879
Eileen.

16:47.047 --> 16:51.092
Eileen, why don't you believe me?

16:51.260 --> 16:52.301
Words aren't good enough.

16:52.469 --> 16:55.638
I want my actions to speak for me.
Haven't you been listening?

16:55.806 --> 16:57.765
I have been wrong all these years.

16:57.933 --> 17:01.602
I am trying to make up for it.

17:01.979 --> 17:05.398
Sometimes making up for things
only makes it worse.

17:05.566 --> 17:08.026
Oh, Eileen.

17:10.112 --> 17:14.741
You should have been the best thing
that ever happened to me.

17:14.908 --> 17:17.535
Ben, please.

17:19.872 --> 17:22.457
I haven't held you since that night.

17:22.624 --> 17:24.417
Don't.

17:24.626 --> 17:27.253
Oh, I wanna hold you.

17:27.671 --> 17:29.881
I wanna go back.

17:30.174 --> 17:33.259
- God, if you'd just...
- Please, don't!

17:38.766 --> 17:40.892
I'm sorry.

17:46.857 --> 17:49.901
- Have you told her?
- God, no.

17:50.069 --> 17:54.363
Never. I never will.
And you must promise me the same.

17:54.531 --> 17:57.533
You mustn't come over again.

17:58.410 --> 18:01.079
You must stay away from her.

18:03.123 --> 18:05.249
I understand.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.585
I hope you do.

18:16.261 --> 18:19.013
What the hell was that all about?

18:19.681 --> 18:21.808
I don't know.

18:25.687 --> 18:28.106
But I'm gonna find out.

18:29.483 --> 18:32.318
Harry, the best cure I ever came
across for a hangover

18:32.486 --> 18:35.113
was raw meat, and plenty of it.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.614
You break an egg on it.

18:37.116 --> 18:42.703
Add in some salted anchovies,
Tabasco and Worcestershire sauce.

18:42.871 --> 18:45.832
If you want,
we can order up some for you.

18:48.710 --> 18:51.546
Now that I come to mention it, Coop,
you know what I'm in the mood for?

18:51.713 --> 18:52.755
What's that, Gordon?

18:52.923 --> 18:54.841
A steak so rare
you could sell it at Tiffany's.

18:55.008 --> 18:57.677
Well, you've come to the right place.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.263
Good deal.

19:01.682 --> 19:04.517
Holy smokes, who is that?

19:06.728 --> 19:07.854
Shelly Johnson.

19:09.731 --> 19:11.023
Shelly Johnson!

19:15.487 --> 19:17.530
What a beauty.

19:17.698 --> 19:21.033
Kind of reminds me of that statue,
the babe without the arms.

19:21.827 --> 19:23.578
- Venus de Milo.
- The name was Milo,

19:23.745 --> 19:25.913
but that's beside the point.

19:26.081 --> 19:29.417
That's the kind of girl to make you wish
you spoke a little French.

19:31.336 --> 19:36.716
Excuse me, Coop, while I try my hand
at a little counter Esperanto.

19:36.884 --> 19:38.968
Good luck, Gordon.

19:41.763 --> 19:43.055
Hello.

19:43.265 --> 19:47.310
I was wondering if I might trouble you
for a cup of strong black coffee

19:47.811 --> 19:48.895
and in the process,

19:49.062 --> 19:53.191
engage you with an anecdote
of no small amusement.

19:54.318 --> 19:56.277
The name is Gordon Cole,

19:56.486 --> 19:58.696
and I couldn't help
but notice you from the booth.

19:58.864 --> 20:02.700
And, well, seeing your beauty now,

20:02.868 --> 20:07.246
I feel as though my stomach is filled
with a team of bumblebees.

20:07.664 --> 20:09.707
You don't have to shout.
I can hear you.

20:10.542 --> 20:14.420
I heard that.

20:15.130 --> 20:17.048
Um, do you want anything
besides coffee?

20:17.257 --> 20:18.966
I heard you perfectly.

20:19.176 --> 20:21.010
And I can hear you, honest, please...

20:21.178 --> 20:23.554
You don't understand.

20:23.764 --> 20:25.806
You don't understand, Miss Johnson.

20:25.974 --> 20:27.892
- Do you see these?
- Uh-huh.

20:28.060 --> 20:30.728
For 20 years, I've been
asking people to please speak up,

20:30.896 --> 20:34.398
but for some weird reason,
I can hear you clear as a bell.

20:34.566 --> 20:35.983
Say something else.

20:37.027 --> 20:38.236
Um, uh...

20:38.403 --> 20:40.029
Do you want pie with your coffee?

20:40.781 --> 20:43.241
Good Lord. I can hear you perfectly.

20:43.408 --> 20:47.286
This is like some kind of miracle.
A phenomenon.

20:47.496 --> 20:49.664
- What's wrong with miracles?
- What's that?

20:51.750 --> 20:54.502
This cherry pie is a miracle.

20:55.087 --> 20:59.966
Would you please ask the lady
with the log to speak up?

21:00.133 --> 21:04.178
Um, the pie.
She was talking about the cherry pie.

21:04.388 --> 21:07.473
I heard you again. I heard you again.

21:09.142 --> 21:10.309
Would you like some pie?

21:10.686 --> 21:12.812
Massive, massive quantities.

21:12.980 --> 21:16.399
And a glass of water, sweetheart.
My socks are on fire.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.048
Harry.

21:42.050 --> 21:45.011
That looks like a chickadee
on a Dodge Dart.

21:45.178 --> 21:49.598
No, it looks like a finch
on a Dodge Dart.

21:49.766 --> 21:52.518
Nope, chickadee on a Dodge Dart.

21:54.730 --> 21:57.982
- Hi.
- Hi. Cup of deep black joe?

21:58.525 --> 21:59.567
You bet.

22:03.488 --> 22:05.614
What do you recommend
for a hangover?

22:06.283 --> 22:07.742
Teetotaling and prayer.

22:08.410 --> 22:09.452
Good answer.

22:09.953 --> 22:12.246
I'll try some coffee.

22:13.957 --> 22:15.416
How are you today?

22:16.877 --> 22:18.502
I'm fine.

22:18.670 --> 22:19.879
I'm weird, actually.

22:20.255 --> 22:21.672
I'm disoriented.

22:21.882 --> 22:24.216
I'm not sure where I am.
I mean, I know where I am,

22:24.384 --> 22:26.802
but it feels odd being here.

22:26.970 --> 22:28.095
I'm okay.

22:29.056 --> 22:30.556
Okay.

22:30.724 --> 22:32.975
Listen to me.
I've been out of circulation so long,

22:33.185 --> 22:35.644
I've completely forgotten
the social niceties.

22:35.812 --> 22:36.979
I mean, you ask me how I am,

22:37.147 --> 22:38.731
I'm not really supposed
to say how I am.

22:38.899 --> 22:41.817
I'm supposed to say,
"I'm fine, thanks. How are you?"

22:42.319 --> 22:44.153
I'm fine, thanks.

22:46.948 --> 22:48.949
You must think I'm really strange.

22:49.117 --> 22:50.409
No.

22:50.619 --> 22:52.453
Well, with due respect
to the social niceties,

22:52.621 --> 22:55.915
even if you did think I was strange,
you wouldn't tell me, would you?

22:56.124 --> 22:58.417
No, if I thought you were strange,
I'd tell you.

22:58.627 --> 23:00.711
And you don't think so?

23:01.338 --> 23:02.588
Not a bit.

23:03.215 --> 23:06.050
Good. Glad we got that cleared up.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.803
So, what will you have?

23:08.970 --> 23:13.432
I would like a chicken potpie
and a large glass of milk, please.

23:13.642 --> 23:16.102
Good choice.
All the major food groups represented.

23:16.686 --> 23:20.981
Turkey sandwich, whole wheat,
lettuce, dollop of mayonnaise,

23:21.149 --> 23:22.441
and I've got a joke for you.

23:23.151 --> 23:25.486
Two penguins were walking
across an iceberg.

23:26.029 --> 23:28.280
One penguin turned
to the second penguin and said:

23:28.448 --> 23:30.366
"You look like
you're wearing a tuxedo."

23:30.534 --> 23:31.617
Annie?

23:31.993 --> 23:33.786
I heard that.

23:34.538 --> 23:36.539
Wait a minute. I'll be right back.

23:37.499 --> 23:39.166
I wasn't quite finished.

23:41.294 --> 23:43.129
How long you been
in love with her?

23:44.798 --> 23:46.590
Harry, who said anything
about love?

23:47.467 --> 23:51.220
Coop, you just tried to tell her a joke.

23:51.763 --> 23:53.597
I did?

23:57.102 --> 23:59.812
So, what did
the second penguin say?

24:00.564 --> 24:02.606
Well, the first penguin said
to the second penguin:

24:02.774 --> 24:04.650
"You look like
you're wearing a tuxedo."

24:04.818 --> 24:08.612
And the second penguin said,
"Maybe I am."

24:12.617 --> 24:14.743
The defense rests.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.788
Do you want some more pie?
A whole pie?

24:17.998 --> 24:21.667
Yes, I would, Miss Johnson,
and a piece of paper and a pencil.

24:21.835 --> 24:25.421
I plan on writing an epic poem
about this gorgeous pie.

24:26.131 --> 24:27.923
Okay.

24:34.639 --> 24:36.640
I see that you've been to Owl Cave.

24:37.350 --> 24:38.893
Sorry?

24:39.060 --> 24:42.104
Well, that design looks like
the one up at Owl Cave.

24:43.064 --> 24:44.899
Let me see that.

24:45.066 --> 24:47.485
I combined Major Briggs' tattoo
with the Log Lady's.

24:49.779 --> 24:52.364
This looks exactly
like the one at Owl Cave.

24:53.283 --> 24:56.744
Harry, I've got to see this Owl Cave.

25:16.348 --> 25:17.473
Dear Donna,

25:17.849 --> 25:20.434
You were right, I had to go.

25:20.602 --> 25:23.854
Everything feels different
when you're on the road.

25:24.189 --> 25:26.232
It feels better.

25:26.650 --> 25:28.734
San Francisco's really cool.

25:28.902 --> 25:31.195
Next stop, Mexico.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.572
I'll be back with a million stories.

25:33.740 --> 25:35.407
I promise.

25:35.575 --> 25:38.619
I love you, James.

25:48.088 --> 25:49.713
James?

25:50.632 --> 25:51.840
How is he?

25:52.342 --> 25:53.676
He's good.

25:53.843 --> 25:55.928
He's doing what he needed to do.

25:57.222 --> 25:58.556
He'll be back.

26:01.685 --> 26:05.020
Dad, can I ask you something?

26:05.480 --> 26:06.605
Sure.

26:06.815 --> 26:08.899
How does Mom know
Benjamin Horne?

26:09.609 --> 26:13.070
I doubt that she does, Donna.
Not very well.

26:13.530 --> 26:15.072
He was over here yesterday.

26:15.282 --> 26:17.366
They were talking like old friends.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.743
Your mother works a lot
with the local charities.

26:19.911 --> 26:23.163
I'm sure even Ben contributes
once in a while.

26:23.373 --> 26:26.875
She drove to The Great Northern
this morning to see him again.

26:27.043 --> 26:30.337
Ah, probably something to do
with a fundraiser.

26:30.505 --> 26:31.547
I don't think so.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.926
Yeah, that's exactly what it was.
She told me at breakfast.

26:36.094 --> 26:38.554
One of those heal-the-planet things.

26:40.557 --> 26:42.391
Well, she didn't mention it to me.

26:42.892 --> 26:45.394
Well, that's exactly what it was.
That's what she told me.

26:48.648 --> 26:50.524
I'll get it.

26:55.238 --> 26:57.781
Hi, I have a delivery for Mrs. Hayward.

27:05.790 --> 27:07.458
They said they're for Mom.

27:07.667 --> 27:09.668
No card.

27:10.754 --> 27:12.463
I'll put them in water.

27:36.613 --> 27:38.822
Aah! Sorry, sorry, my fault. Heh.

27:38.990 --> 27:41.075
- Oh... I didn't hear you.
- No.

27:41.242 --> 27:44.244
One should never allow
one's mind and one's foot

27:44.412 --> 27:45.788
to wander at the same time.

27:47.957 --> 27:50.626
Edward Perkins.
Once again, my apologies.

27:51.044 --> 27:52.961
Audrey Horne.
Nice to meet you, Mr. Perkins.

27:53.171 --> 27:56.256
Mm-hm, mm-hm.
So, what brings you to the library?

27:56.466 --> 27:58.884
I'm doing research
on civil disobedience.

27:59.094 --> 28:02.304
Good for you. It is incumbent
on the young to disobey.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.306
Ha, ha. Are you a professor?

28:04.516 --> 28:08.519
Well, I teach.
Poetry is my area of expertise.

28:08.687 --> 28:12.106
You're kidding. You know, someone
sent me a poem. Maybe you know it.

28:12.315 --> 28:15.067
Oh, perhaps I do.
Now, let's have a look.

28:16.277 --> 28:18.362
Oh. Hmm.

28:19.322 --> 28:20.364
You read it.

28:21.825 --> 28:23.409
Okay.

28:23.576 --> 28:26.870
See the mountains kiss high heaven
And the waves clasp one another

28:27.038 --> 28:30.916
No sister-flower would be forgiven
If it disdain'd its brother

28:31.084 --> 28:34.628
And the sunlight clasps the earth
And the moonbeams kiss the sea

28:34.796 --> 28:41.760
What is all this sweet work worth
If thou kiss not me?

28:41.928 --> 28:43.262
Yeah, you know it.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.056
Yes. Shelley.

28:47.767 --> 28:49.309
What?

28:49.477 --> 28:51.645
Gazing at you

28:51.813 --> 28:54.606
reciting the verse of Shelley,

28:54.774 --> 28:58.235
you look very much like a queen.

29:00.905 --> 29:02.072
Thank you.

29:02.282 --> 29:03.782
Um...

29:03.950 --> 29:06.660
I guess I better be going.
Nice meeting you.

29:06.870 --> 29:08.996
- Perhaps we'll meet again someday.
- Yeah.

29:27.766 --> 29:30.142
- Thinking of entering?
- Heh. No.

29:30.310 --> 29:32.936
I think the real world's strange enough
without getting on-stage

29:33.104 --> 29:35.522
and parading around
in a bathing suit and heels.

29:35.690 --> 29:38.025
Guess the convent's not too big
on that kind of stuff.

29:38.568 --> 29:39.985
That's a good guess.

29:40.361 --> 29:43.614
So, what's it like being back
in civilization?

29:44.908 --> 29:46.825
It's not like they kept us
cooped up in an attic.

29:46.993 --> 29:50.412
I mean, we had newspapers.
We even had cable TV.

29:51.164 --> 29:54.249
Every time I tell someone where I've
been, they act like I'm out on parole.

29:55.627 --> 29:57.127
Sorry.

29:58.880 --> 30:01.882
You know what is weird?
Being around men again.

30:03.301 --> 30:05.886
Well, you don't have to spend time
in a convent to feel that.

30:07.680 --> 30:09.306
What do you know
about Dale Cooper?

30:09.974 --> 30:11.350
Are we interested?

30:11.559 --> 30:12.726
Who said anything about that?

30:12.894 --> 30:15.562
Well, judging by the look on his face
when he saw you today,

30:15.730 --> 30:17.898
I'd say you have a major opportunity.

30:18.566 --> 30:19.983
Sorry, you have it all wrong.

30:20.151 --> 30:22.778
I'm not even remotely interested.

30:48.805 --> 30:49.847
Andy?

30:50.265 --> 30:51.974
Yes, Lucy.

30:52.141 --> 30:57.104
I wanna thank you for helping out
during the weasel riot yesterday.

30:57.272 --> 31:00.899
Which is more than I can say
for a certain Dick we both know.

31:01.401 --> 31:04.778
Keeping the peace is part of my job.

31:06.406 --> 31:08.699
Where are you going
with all of that gear?

31:09.492 --> 31:11.618
- Spelunking.
- Oh.

31:12.245 --> 31:14.872
Is it dangerous? Spelunking?

31:17.333 --> 31:19.001
Sometimes.

31:19.502 --> 31:21.169
Promise me something?

31:21.880 --> 31:23.463
Okay.

31:24.215 --> 31:26.258
I know you'll be strong,

31:26.676 --> 31:29.386
and I know you'll be brave,

31:29.596 --> 31:33.724
but I want you to promise me
that you'll be careful.

31:34.809 --> 31:38.854
I'll be careful. You have my word.

31:46.654 --> 31:50.949
Oh... dear.

31:56.456 --> 31:57.497
All set, Harry?

31:57.665 --> 32:00.292
Pete just called in our next move.

32:01.252 --> 32:04.046
- We expose a pawn to his bishop.
- Want me to hold off?

32:04.213 --> 32:05.631
No, Pete knows what he's doing.

32:05.798 --> 32:07.633
If he takes that pawn,
he forfeits the bishop,

32:07.800 --> 32:09.843
thus losing his initial advantage.

32:10.011 --> 32:11.053
How you feeling?

32:11.220 --> 32:13.722
Like someone pounded
a railroad spike through my ear.

32:13.890 --> 32:16.266
Then a descent into a cool
subterranean cave

32:16.434 --> 32:19.353
will be just what the doctor ordered.

32:19.520 --> 32:21.146
Are you sure Cole's up
for the climb?

32:21.314 --> 32:22.940
Gordon's not coming with us.

32:23.107 --> 32:26.318
Shelly took him up to Doc Hayward's
to see about his hearing problem.

32:26.486 --> 32:29.154
The old tuning-fork test.

32:47.006 --> 32:48.799
Audrey?

32:49.425 --> 32:51.301
When Jack Kennedy
entered the White House,

32:51.469 --> 32:53.345
he took his brother with him

32:53.513 --> 32:56.723
because he trusted Bobby
to tell him the truth,

32:56.891 --> 32:59.309
even when it wasn't pretty.

32:59.811 --> 33:04.022
When the Bay of Pigs went up
in smoke, Bobby was there.

33:04.190 --> 33:08.443
When the Russians moved
their missiles into Fidel's backyard,

33:08.611 --> 33:12.489
Bobby was there to help his brother
shoulder through.

33:13.074 --> 33:15.701
Sort of how Jerry's done that
for you?

33:15.868 --> 33:21.331
It's the unvarnished truth
that I am looking for.

33:21.499 --> 33:25.711
And I believe that you

33:27.380 --> 33:31.008
are the best man for the job.

33:31.175 --> 33:32.259
Me?

33:36.139 --> 33:37.931
Audrey,

33:38.891 --> 33:43.061
I know that I haven't been
a very good father.

33:45.273 --> 33:48.984
Oh, heck, who am I kidding?

33:49.152 --> 33:55.615
When have I ever been anything
but a sleazy, rapacious heel?

33:57.410 --> 33:59.161
Well, Daddy,
maybe when I was little, but...

33:59.328 --> 34:03.040
Exactly. But I've changed.

34:03.207 --> 34:06.710
And I am determined
to be a better person.

34:06.878 --> 34:11.882
The kind of father
that you will respect someday.

34:16.054 --> 34:20.682
When I think about Laura,

34:21.142 --> 34:24.144
when I think about the mistakes
that I've made,

34:24.812 --> 34:31.818
I want to build a life in happiness
for our whole family.

34:31.986 --> 34:34.279
You, me.

34:36.657 --> 34:38.909
Will you help me do that?

34:40.036 --> 34:41.870
Please?

34:42.538 --> 34:45.290
Daddy, I'm your man.

34:46.084 --> 34:48.877
Sensational.

34:49.045 --> 34:52.380
Audrey, pack a bag.
Get out to the airport.

34:52.548 --> 34:54.466
Your plane leaves in an hour.

34:54.634 --> 34:56.009
My plane?

34:58.012 --> 35:02.057
Oh, John.
Just the man that I wanna see.

35:02.266 --> 35:03.975
Hi, Ben. Hello, Audrey.

35:04.811 --> 35:08.605
- Daddy, um...
- Audrey, you better get a move on.

35:08.773 --> 35:11.483
One hour. Audrey's on her way
to Seattle tonight.

35:11.651 --> 35:14.486
She's having a breakfast confab
with the environmentalists.

35:14.654 --> 35:17.864
We're going national
with this... pine-weasel thing.

35:18.032 --> 35:20.200
Oh. Great. That's great.

35:20.827 --> 35:22.994
Daddy, I'm not sure I can leave
on such short notice.

35:23.162 --> 35:26.248
Now, here are the particulars.
Time, place, so on.

35:26.791 --> 35:29.668
Audrey, you bring us back
good news.

35:31.879 --> 35:33.755
Good news, heh.

35:36.592 --> 35:39.427
Well, guess I better go.

35:48.855 --> 35:49.980
- Bye.
- Bye.

35:50.148 --> 35:52.649
Travel safely, Audrey.

35:55.611 --> 35:57.070
John.

36:01.200 --> 36:02.784
Ah.

36:04.912 --> 36:06.746
How are you, Ben?

36:09.167 --> 36:15.380
I am filled to the brim
with a feeling of goodness.

36:16.007 --> 36:19.843
Like a Christmas tree
all lit up inside.

36:20.011 --> 36:26.516
But at the end of the day
when I look in the mirror,

36:26.684 --> 36:33.315
I have to face the fact
that I really don't know how to be good.

36:33.482 --> 36:35.066
You're off to a pretty fair start.

36:35.735 --> 36:38.320
How do you do it, John?
What's the secret?

36:38.487 --> 36:42.324
Do you really think
that I could learn to be good?

36:42.533 --> 36:45.619
I don't see why not.
Just keep your eye on your heart.

36:45.786 --> 36:46.995
And always tell the truth.

36:48.581 --> 36:52.375
- Always tell the truth.
- Tell the hardest truth first, though.

36:52.585 --> 36:57.088
Oh, always tell the hardest truth first.
Oh, I love that.

36:57.298 --> 36:58.965
John, that's terrific.

36:59.133 --> 37:03.970
This truth business,
it's clearly at the forefront of goodness.

37:04.138 --> 37:05.180
Ben?

37:05.598 --> 37:06.681
Hmm?

37:06.849 --> 37:10.602
- I'm falling in love with your daughter.
- Yeah, that's a hard truth.

37:10.770 --> 37:13.063
- Good example.
- It is the truth.

37:15.066 --> 37:17.484
- It is?
- Yep.

37:20.571 --> 37:23.406
Oh, John.

37:23.866 --> 37:26.493
- John.
- Ben.

37:27.620 --> 37:30.372
What a wonderful world we live in.

37:43.928 --> 37:45.971
- Come on, Andy.
- Get a good grip, Andy.

37:46.138 --> 37:47.555
- Do it.
- That's it, Andy.

37:47.723 --> 37:50.183
- Looking good.
- Hand over hand.

37:50.935 --> 37:52.352
Almost there. Take it easy.

37:52.520 --> 37:53.770
No, no, no. Don't look down. No.

37:53.938 --> 37:55.647
Hang on, Andy. Don't look down.

37:55.815 --> 37:57.774
- Hang on.
- Don't look down!

38:00.403 --> 38:02.821
- Andy.
- You okay?

38:02.989 --> 38:04.948
I'm fine.

38:09.537 --> 38:12.330
Whew. Incredible.

38:13.332 --> 38:15.792
We used to play here
when I was a kid.

38:15.960 --> 38:18.753
Pretended it was haunted
by fierce ghosts.

38:18.921 --> 38:20.880
Beer drinkers, by the look of it.

38:21.048 --> 38:23.258
Where's the symbol?

38:23.801 --> 38:25.719
This way.

38:36.105 --> 38:38.189
It's right here.

38:46.449 --> 38:49.242
- There it is.
- Whoa.

38:51.162 --> 38:52.620
Wow.

38:53.497 --> 38:58.585
Two symbols combined
into a larger whole.

38:58.753 --> 39:00.170
But for what purpose?

39:00.963 --> 39:02.047
I don't know.

39:02.548 --> 39:03.590
Beats me.

39:03.758 --> 39:06.885
The tattoos are the question.

39:07.053 --> 39:08.803
This must be the answer.

39:47.635 --> 39:48.927
It's stuck.

39:49.095 --> 39:51.971
My pick, it's stuck.

39:56.560 --> 39:58.853
Oh, my God.

40:16.455 --> 40:19.624
- Wow.
- Holy smoke.

40:23.879 --> 40:25.505
Look at that.

40:31.470 --> 40:33.471
What have I done?

40:34.306 --> 40:40.395
Fellas, coincidence and fate
figure largely in our lives.

40:50.739 --> 40:53.867
It appears to be a petroglyph.

40:54.702 --> 40:58.455
Harry, I have no idea
where this will lead us.

40:58.622 --> 41:05.170
But I have a definite feeling it will be
a place both wonderful and strange.

41:39.997 --> 41:42.123
Good evening.
Can I help you, young lady?

41:43.375 --> 41:46.628
Yes, I would like something to drink,
but I'm not exactly sure what.

41:47.213 --> 41:48.713
Ladies seem to like the rum.

41:49.173 --> 41:51.257
Rum. I would like to have
a rum, please.

41:51.425 --> 41:54.427
- Uh, with?
- Tonic?

41:57.640 --> 42:02.685
Diane, Thursday, 9:05 p.m.

42:02.853 --> 42:05.730
I've just returned from a place
called Owl Cave.

42:05.898 --> 42:08.107
How I got there
is a rather complicated story.

42:08.275 --> 42:11.402
It all began with a pair of tattoos...

42:21.080 --> 42:22.121
First one's on me.

42:22.331 --> 42:23.748
Thank you.

42:23.916 --> 42:25.542
- Hello, Annie.
- Hi.

42:25.709 --> 42:28.461
- Can I get you something...? Oh.
- No, no. I have a rum and tonic.

42:28.629 --> 42:29.796
I see.

42:29.964 --> 42:31.798
One of the sisters
used to put rum in her tea,

42:31.966 --> 42:34.175
and I thought it sounded exotic, so...

42:34.343 --> 42:35.760
This is all new to you, isn't it?

42:37.012 --> 42:41.349
I feel constantly amazed, stunned.

42:41.517 --> 42:43.726
Music and people,

42:43.894 --> 42:45.937
the way they talk and laugh,

42:46.105 --> 42:48.022
and the way some of them
are so clearly in love.

42:48.524 --> 42:50.358
It's like a foreign language to me.

42:50.568 --> 42:53.695
I know just enough of the words
to realize how little I understand.

42:54.488 --> 42:56.864
Man, I would love to see the world
through your eyes.

42:57.616 --> 42:58.658
Why?

42:58.867 --> 43:02.579
Oh, there's some things
I might do different if I had the chance.

43:02.746 --> 43:04.747
Me too.

43:18.762 --> 43:22.223
You see, the thing is,
I failed before and...

43:27.354 --> 43:29.480
I'm just afraid it might happen again.

43:31.025 --> 43:32.483
You wanna talk about it?

43:33.944 --> 43:35.903
Not yet.

43:37.364 --> 43:38.489
Maybe I can help.

43:40.367 --> 43:41.534
Can you?

43:41.994 --> 43:43.494
If you want me to.

43:44.955 --> 43:47.790
I'm stubborn. Extremely willful.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.250
I can handle that.

43:50.628 --> 43:52.503
Some people think I'm strange.

43:52.713 --> 43:54.088
I know the feeling.

43:57.635 --> 43:59.969
I couldn't promise you
that I would always make sense

44:00.137 --> 44:02.221
or do things
that you would expect me to do.

44:02.431 --> 44:04.140
Annie, I don't expect anything.

44:06.602 --> 44:09.354
Then I accept your kind
and generous offer.

44:10.939 --> 44:14.025
Good. I'm glad.

44:37.591 --> 44:40.760
My, my, my.

44:41.428 --> 44:43.763
What have we

44:44.556 --> 44:45.932
here?

44:47.393 --> 44:49.394
Could it be?

44:52.606 --> 44:54.482
Yes.

44:56.652 --> 44:58.903
The symbol inverted.

45:04.159 --> 45:06.119
Now...
