[theme music]

00:08.142 --> 00:09.577
Hi.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.045
Hey.

00:11.079 --> 00:12.146
What did the doctor say?

00:12.180 --> 00:13.081
How's the baby?

00:13.114 --> 00:15.983
Well, she's doing great, and--

00:16.016 --> 00:18.052
pretty weird-- she's
bigger than normal.

00:18.086 --> 00:19.920
Go figure.

00:19.953 --> 00:23.657
And they say it's bad
to live under power lines.

00:23.691 --> 00:26.960
Yeah, at first I felt
weird for gaining 30 pounds.

00:26.994 --> 00:31.432
But now I figure most of
that weight's the fetus.

00:31.465 --> 00:32.733
Hello?

00:32.766 --> 00:34.702
Hello, Conner baby!

00:37.738 --> 00:40.074
Oh man.

00:40.108 --> 00:43.077
That's four inches
of fight and fury.

00:43.111 --> 00:44.645
Boy, this one really can kick.

00:44.678 --> 00:45.946
Yeah.

00:45.979 --> 00:48.149
Yesterday, I got slapped in
the head with my own boob.

00:50.951 --> 00:53.387
And we're going to spoil
you rotten, little girl.

00:53.421 --> 00:55.256
Oh yes we are!

00:55.289 --> 00:58.292
$1,500 in the bank.

00:58.326 --> 01:02.196
We can afford to buy you
food and water and maybe

01:02.230 --> 01:05.433
a shiny new table saw!

01:05.466 --> 01:13.241
That's great, Dan, except
that we owe the doctor $2,000.

01:13.274 --> 01:14.375
What?

01:14.408 --> 01:16.777
We have to prepay the
cost of having the baby.

01:16.810 --> 01:19.747
We didn't have to do
that with the first batch.

01:19.780 --> 01:23.016
Well, back then, we were broke
and the county took care of it.

01:23.050 --> 01:24.885
That's why those kids were free.

01:24.918 --> 01:28.156
And apparently, you do
get what you pay for.

01:28.189 --> 01:30.358
Hey, we brought it
all the groceries.

01:30.391 --> 01:32.460
But where does everything go?

01:32.493 --> 01:36.997
Well the frozen stuff
goes in the freezer.

01:37.030 --> 01:39.233
And the canned staff
goes on the shelf.

01:39.267 --> 01:40.534
And that about covers it.

01:43.404 --> 01:45.873
Boy, it's going to be tight.

01:45.906 --> 01:49.710
I wish we would have
invested better.

01:49.743 --> 01:53.914
Why, oh why did we stop
buying lottery tickets?

01:53.947 --> 01:54.915
Mom, Dad?

01:54.948 --> 01:56.984
We have got some amazing news.

01:57.017 --> 01:58.452
Mark and I were just
looking for apartments,

01:58.486 --> 02:00.120
and we found, like, the
cutest place to live in,

02:00.154 --> 02:03.056
and it was available right
away, so we just took it.

02:03.090 --> 02:03.957
That's great!

02:03.991 --> 02:07.428
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

02:07.461 --> 02:09.330
Of course, we'll miss
having you around and all.

02:11.865 --> 02:12.933
Gee, Dan.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.769
I've never seen you this
deliriously unhappy.

02:15.803 --> 02:17.371
Where is the apartment at?

02:17.405 --> 02:18.306
Well that's the best part.

02:18.339 --> 02:19.673
It's not an apartment.

02:19.707 --> 02:22.610
It's a chance for us to buy
something that's really ours.

02:22.643 --> 02:23.777
You're buying a house?

02:23.811 --> 02:25.479
How can you afford that?

02:25.513 --> 02:27.281
Because it's not a house.

02:27.315 --> 02:28.115
It is a trailer!

02:31.785 --> 02:35.356
It is, like, the cutest little
trailer you have ever seen.

02:35.389 --> 02:37.090
Isn't this incredible?

02:37.124 --> 02:38.226
Yeah.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.994
Well, that's, like,
the best news I've

02:41.028 --> 02:42.763
heard since you married Mark.

02:45.833 --> 02:48.736
[theme song]

03:28.776 --> 03:31.144
[cackles]

03:39.253 --> 03:42.189
Aunt Jackie, didn't
you want to keep this?

03:42.222 --> 03:43.557
No!
No.

03:43.591 --> 03:47.661
Family things need
to be passed down.

03:47.695 --> 03:49.430
Now, that's the chair I
was telling you about.

03:49.463 --> 03:50.331
That's one of my favorites.

03:50.364 --> 03:53.301
But I want you to have that.

03:53.334 --> 03:55.536
Well, that's certainly
generous of you, Jackie.

03:55.569 --> 03:59.807
Maybe tomorrow you can bring
by your beanless beanbag chair.

03:59.840 --> 04:04.177
I'll just run
that inside for you.

04:04.211 --> 04:05.078
Hey, Beck.

04:05.112 --> 04:06.179
Did you see the bathroom door?

04:06.213 --> 04:08.949
It slides into the wall,
just like Star Trek!

04:08.982 --> 04:09.783
No way!

04:12.953 --> 04:13.754
Man, I'm beat.

04:16.424 --> 04:19.727
Hasn't this just
been a great day?

04:19.760 --> 04:21.529
You sure are chipper.

04:21.562 --> 04:22.596
Yeah, well, you know.

04:22.630 --> 04:24.698
That's my way.

04:24.732 --> 04:26.834
Your oldest daughter
is leaving home.

04:26.867 --> 04:29.437
I just figured you'd be said.

04:29.470 --> 04:33.874
Very, very, very,
very, very sad.

04:33.907 --> 04:36.243
Oh, it's not like
she's leaving town.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.646
It's like she's gone camping
for the rest of her life.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.082
My turn.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.523
Remember our first place?

04:49.557 --> 04:51.692
Yeah, that was a dump.

04:51.725 --> 04:52.960
When are we moving out of there?

04:55.763 --> 04:59.933
My sister is moving
into a trailer park.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.069
I can't tell you where I was
the day Kennedy was shot,

05:02.102 --> 05:05.205
but I will always
remember this moment.

05:05.238 --> 05:07.641
I don't think it's
so bad, Darlene.

05:07.675 --> 05:11.178
I mean, it's like living in a
house, it's just got wheels.

05:11.211 --> 05:13.914
It's like living in
your car, only better,

05:13.947 --> 05:16.650
because it's, you know, bigger.

05:16.684 --> 05:19.186
So it's kind of like
living in a bus.

05:19.219 --> 05:20.454
Plus, you got the
bathroom, so it's

05:20.488 --> 05:25.292
kind of like a really nice bus.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.193
Yeah, well pull the cord.

05:26.226 --> 05:28.295
I'm getting off.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.530
Hey.

05:29.563 --> 05:32.232
Don't make fun of your
sister living in a trailer.

05:32.265 --> 05:33.767
If it's good enough
for carnival folk,

05:33.801 --> 05:34.802
it's good enough
for the Conners.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.308
Hey.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.143
I certainly hope
you're going to clean

05:43.176 --> 05:46.647
this mess up when you're done.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.949
You were afraid there
would be no stills nearby.

05:51.652 --> 05:54.154
So, you the new
owners of this dump?

05:54.187 --> 05:56.289
Do we look like we're
made out of money?

05:56.323 --> 05:58.826
We rent.

05:58.859 --> 06:00.828
Where you from?

06:00.861 --> 06:01.662
We're from Europe.

06:05.165 --> 06:08.702
Unless you've got a
problem with that.

06:08.736 --> 06:10.538
We're the Conners.

06:10.571 --> 06:11.905
Hey.

06:11.939 --> 06:14.074
Conners?

06:14.107 --> 06:18.512
Did you ever do time at Joliet?

06:18.546 --> 06:20.213
No, but I've got
a question for you.

06:20.247 --> 06:22.182
Do you ever brush your teeth?

06:22.215 --> 06:23.784
Hey, that's
personal information,

06:23.817 --> 06:27.421
missy We mind our own
beeswax around here.

06:27.455 --> 06:28.856
Well in that
case, I'm not going

06:28.889 --> 06:31.559
to ask if that's your kid
sucking on the Windex bottle

06:31.592 --> 06:34.161
over there.

06:34.194 --> 06:37.731
Eddie, for God's sake,
put that thing down.

06:37.765 --> 06:38.866
And you.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.634
You stay away from my husband.

06:40.668 --> 06:41.535
Oh, girls.

06:41.569 --> 06:42.903
Let's be neighborly.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.072
Unless of course,
you want to swap.

06:45.105 --> 06:47.140
Hey, baby.

06:47.174 --> 06:48.075
You're a big hunk of man.

06:50.978 --> 06:52.345
Listen, missy.

06:52.379 --> 06:54.281
We don't know you and we
don't want to know you,

06:54.314 --> 06:55.182
and here's why.

06:55.215 --> 06:56.216
Fine.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.851
We're better than you.

06:57.885 --> 07:02.189
And we almost never get
a chance to say that.

07:02.222 --> 07:06.359
Fine with me, sister.

07:06.393 --> 07:07.661
Here.

07:07.695 --> 07:12.466
Some coupons and a map
to get around the park.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.668
I'm the welcome wagon.

07:14.702 --> 07:15.503
Welcome, welcome.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.943
Don't you ever feed my dog.

07:22.976 --> 07:25.813
If I get drunk enough,
I'll fight your dog.

07:29.449 --> 07:31.885
Man, is she a snob.

07:31.919 --> 07:32.986
Come on, Darlene.

07:33.020 --> 07:36.256
It won't kill us to
help clean the place.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.359
Unless the wind picks up.

07:39.392 --> 07:41.829
Oh, everybody's
back in the bedroom.

07:41.862 --> 07:44.164
So you might want to hang
out in the living room,

07:44.197 --> 07:50.704
because we don't want
the thing to tilt. Found

07:50.738 --> 07:51.539
the perfect spot.

07:54.808 --> 07:55.976
I don't know about
this, Roseanne.

07:56.009 --> 07:57.978
I'm a little worried.
- They'll be fine, Dan.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.113
I told you, it was a
speed bump you hit.

08:00.147 --> 08:03.216
Not a cat.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.151
No no no.

08:04.184 --> 08:05.352
Maybe Darlene is right.

08:05.385 --> 08:07.888
Becky doesn't belong
in a trailer park.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.389
Well, we'll help them
fix it up, you know.

08:09.422 --> 08:14.695
Maybe we can get them a
van to use as a guest room.

08:14.728 --> 08:15.596
Becky, Mark!

08:15.629 --> 08:18.431
They'll be fine.

08:18.465 --> 08:19.767
Yeah?

08:19.800 --> 08:23.503
Um, your Dad and I would
like to offer to help

08:23.537 --> 08:24.872
you fix this place up a little.

08:24.905 --> 08:26.239
You know, I'll make
curtains and your Dad

08:26.273 --> 08:27.741
can help you with the
plumbing, and we'll

08:27.775 --> 08:28.676
get you a little fence.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.210
Security system.

08:30.243 --> 08:33.113
Or at least one of
those little signs.

08:33.146 --> 08:34.014
Oh, you guys.

08:34.047 --> 08:35.415
That's really sweet.

08:35.448 --> 08:37.017
But Mark and I
don't want any help.

08:37.050 --> 08:38.752
It's really important for
us to do this on our own.

08:38.786 --> 08:40.153
But there's so much to do.

08:40.187 --> 08:43.991
Yeah, but eventually, over
the years, it will all get done.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.226
Well you gotta let
us give you something.

08:46.259 --> 08:49.162
What about a big headed
banjo-playing boy

08:49.196 --> 08:51.665
for the front porch?

08:51.699 --> 08:53.166
I said no.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.267
We want to do this ourselves.

08:58.405 --> 08:59.607
Think you're going
to be all right?

08:59.640 --> 09:00.473
Yeah.

09:00.507 --> 09:01.775
Could be worse.

09:01.809 --> 09:04.578
They could be parked on a hill.

09:04.612 --> 09:06.880
[music playing]

09:10.283 --> 09:11.284
Listen, you guys.

09:11.318 --> 09:15.288
I need to talk to
you about something.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.858
Becky and Mark's trailer--

09:17.891 --> 09:19.860
well, it's kind
of a mess, right?

09:19.893 --> 09:21.629
And I want to be able
to help them out,

09:21.662 --> 09:22.796
but they won't let me.

09:22.830 --> 09:24.331
They probably just
want to be alone.

09:24.364 --> 09:26.366
You know the old saying,
when the trailer's rocking--

09:34.141 --> 09:36.610
Bob.

09:36.644 --> 09:39.913
We're talking about
my daughter here.

09:39.947 --> 09:41.214
I know.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.717
I'm just saying.

09:43.751 --> 09:48.789
If it's rocking, you
want to level it.

09:52.860 --> 09:54.394
What are you getting at, Dan?

09:54.427 --> 09:57.130
Well, I know I'm asking
a lot, but here it goes.

09:57.164 --> 10:00.600
I want to give Mark all
the overtime for a while.

10:00.634 --> 10:01.534
Don't worry about it, Dan.

10:01.568 --> 10:03.003
I understand.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.873
It's got to be tough for these
kids starting out in life.

10:05.906 --> 10:07.240
If there's anything
we can do to make

10:07.274 --> 10:09.042
their load a little lighter,
it's going to be our pleasure.

10:12.646 --> 10:13.446
Give me a minute.

10:16.516 --> 10:18.952
Thanks, guys.

10:18.986 --> 10:20.453
Hey, Mark?

10:20.487 --> 10:23.691
When you get done with that,
can I see you for a second?

10:23.724 --> 10:25.392
Oh, wait a minute.

10:25.425 --> 10:26.694
Wait.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.729
There's no work for Mark to
do around here right now.

10:28.762 --> 10:29.930
What are you talking about?

10:29.963 --> 10:31.531
What about the hydraulics
on the garbage truck?

10:31.564 --> 10:33.033
I took care of
it this morning.

10:33.066 --> 10:34.134
What about the school buses?

10:34.167 --> 10:35.068
We need them by Friday.

10:35.102 --> 10:36.236
It's all done, Dan.

10:36.269 --> 10:37.771
Damn!

10:37.805 --> 10:38.839
What's the matter with you guys?

10:38.872 --> 10:41.341
You work for the city!

10:41.374 --> 10:42.242
Don't blame me, Dan!

10:42.275 --> 10:43.076
I didn't do squat!

10:45.779 --> 10:50.050
Yeah, but my daughter is
living in a big mail box!

10:50.083 --> 10:53.286
There's got to be something
around here that needs fixing.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.455
Oh.

10:55.488 --> 10:56.857
You know, I bet the
bottom of this here

10:56.890 --> 10:59.993
table could use a little paint.

11:00.027 --> 11:00.828
Whoopsie!

11:03.630 --> 11:06.099
Forget about painting
this table, Dan.

11:06.133 --> 11:09.536
What about this carburetor?

11:09.569 --> 11:11.104
I think I'll explain
this to Bob outside.

11:13.540 --> 11:14.674
- Hey, what's up, Dan?
- Mark.

11:14.708 --> 11:15.809
Good news.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.477
Got a little overtime for you.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.611
I can't do any all week.

11:18.645 --> 11:20.047
I got a lot of stuff to
do with the new place.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.715
Exactly.

11:21.749 --> 11:23.917
And that time and a half
couldn't come at a better time,

11:23.951 --> 11:25.786
could it?
- I'm sorry, Dan.

11:25.819 --> 11:27.587
Why don't you offer it
to one of the other guys?

11:27.620 --> 11:28.756
The other guys
can't do it, Mark.

11:28.789 --> 11:29.589
Why not?

11:32.125 --> 11:33.894
Garage quartet's got a
gig at the county fair.

11:36.296 --> 11:37.264
Look, Dan.

11:37.297 --> 11:38.431
It's not like I
don't want the money.

11:38.465 --> 11:41.568
I really can't do
any this week, OK?

11:41.601 --> 11:42.469
Dan.

11:42.502 --> 11:43.871
Weirdest thing.

11:43.904 --> 11:47.007
I just noticed the tail lights
are all busted on that cop car

11:47.040 --> 11:49.076
out there.

11:49.109 --> 11:51.244
What's wrong with
your foot, man?

11:51.278 --> 11:53.480
My foot?

11:53.513 --> 11:55.615
New shoes.

11:55.648 --> 11:57.584
Fred.

11:57.617 --> 12:00.754
Apparently, this week
is not the right week

12:00.788 --> 12:02.722
to paint the table, OK?

12:02.756 --> 12:03.857
Oh?

12:03.891 --> 12:06.359
You-- You might
want to talk to Bob.

12:09.629 --> 12:11.364
Bob?

12:11.398 --> 12:12.966
Where is Bob?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.202
You're not going
to believe this, Dan.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.204
Some clown must have
poured sugar in the gas

12:17.237 --> 12:20.507
tank of that school bus.

12:20.540 --> 12:25.012
Well, you can't fix
something like that.

12:25.045 --> 12:26.379
Right.

12:26.413 --> 12:29.682
[music playing]

12:36.523 --> 12:38.458
OK, eat them quick.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.193
In 15 minutes, the bats
start coming around.

12:43.130 --> 12:46.433
This is great.

12:46.466 --> 12:47.534
Yeah, it is.

12:47.567 --> 12:50.804
Good food, great setting.

12:50.838 --> 12:52.339
Makes me wish our
kitchen didn't have

12:52.372 --> 12:55.708
some stupid house around it.

12:55.742 --> 12:59.746
Now, before we start, Mark and
I just want to say thank you.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.849
You guys were so great
to put us up for so long.

13:01.882 --> 13:02.749
Oh, Becky.

13:02.782 --> 13:06.586
Those three years just flew by.

13:06.619 --> 13:08.388
We were only there for one.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.824
Whatever.

13:10.858 --> 13:12.492
Anyway, so far,
setting up house

13:12.525 --> 13:14.127
has been a really
great experience.

13:14.161 --> 13:15.228
Well, good.

13:15.262 --> 13:17.064
In that case, I should
do my motherly duty

13:17.097 --> 13:20.700
and tell you how you can cut
down on your food budget.

13:20.733 --> 13:22.402
OK, say you get this
recipe, you know,

13:22.435 --> 13:24.872
and it calls for
lobster, shrimp, and

13:24.905 --> 13:27.674
that expensive cooking sherry?

13:27.707 --> 13:31.979
What you do is, you just
tear up that recipe.

13:32.012 --> 13:32.946
Thanks, Mom.

13:32.980 --> 13:33.947
We've already
figured out a couple

13:33.981 --> 13:35.315
of our own budget tricks.

13:35.348 --> 13:38.886
Like these burgers cost $2.79
for a pound of ground beef.

13:38.919 --> 13:41.221
And only $1.19 for a
pound of ground meat.

13:47.360 --> 13:48.161
Oh.

13:57.204 --> 13:58.705
You guys got any water?

13:58.738 --> 13:59.606
Oh, shoot.

13:59.639 --> 14:00.707
I forgot to fill up the pitcher.

14:00.740 --> 14:04.211
Here, I'll just run down
to the community spigot.

14:04.244 --> 14:06.046
Your trailer doesn't
have running water?

14:06.079 --> 14:07.714
No, the pipe was broken.

14:07.747 --> 14:09.716
I'll have enough saved up in
a few weeks to buy a new one.

14:09.749 --> 14:11.018
It's no big deal.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.619
Oh, and Becky, don't forget
the purification tablets.

14:12.652 --> 14:13.453
Oh yeah.

14:17.857 --> 14:22.395
Uh, where'd you
get the salt shaker?

14:22.429 --> 14:24.131
Oh, it was in the
trailer when we moved in.

14:24.164 --> 14:26.566
The people before us left it.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.035
Man, that's amazing.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.904
And this is not just
a regular salt shaker.

14:30.938 --> 14:34.641
This is a Niagara
Falls salt shaker.

14:34.674 --> 14:35.742
So?

14:35.775 --> 14:38.378
I mean, antique stores
pay an arm and a leg

14:38.411 --> 14:39.579
for this kind of thing.

14:39.612 --> 14:43.283
I should just take it
now and go ahead and $50.

14:43.316 --> 14:44.117
Wow, OK!

14:47.620 --> 14:50.623
And you know, I was noticing
your dad was checking out

14:50.657 --> 14:53.826
that antique hubcap over there.

14:53.860 --> 14:54.894
Hmm?

14:54.928 --> 14:57.330
Oh, yeah!

14:57.364 --> 14:58.298
That hubcap.

14:58.331 --> 15:03.136
That baby there,
that's from a 1954 uh--

15:03.170 --> 15:04.671
BOTH: Fladler.

15:04.704 --> 15:06.173
It's a classic.

15:06.206 --> 15:09.876
Let me see, uh, I'll
give you $20 for it.

15:09.909 --> 15:12.645
Ah, well, you know,
that's the 1954 price.

15:12.679 --> 15:15.648
You've got to give them
what it's worth today.

15:15.682 --> 15:16.483
$60?

15:19.452 --> 15:21.288
$70?

15:21.321 --> 15:22.289
Hey Becky.

15:22.322 --> 15:23.390
Why don't you run
and get the water?

15:23.423 --> 15:24.624
OK.

15:24.657 --> 15:25.825
Are you sure it's
going to be OK?

15:25.858 --> 15:28.095
I mean, by yourself, with
the dogs and everything?

15:28.128 --> 15:29.496
Yeah, sure.

15:29.529 --> 15:30.998
As long as you bring that big
stick with the long nail in it.

15:37.204 --> 15:38.505
Hey, look.

15:38.538 --> 15:39.872
We told you guys we don't
want you to give us any money,

15:39.906 --> 15:41.108
remember?
- Yeah.

15:41.141 --> 15:42.509
All right.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.677
Well then can't you at least be
a little less obvious about it?

15:44.711 --> 15:45.578
Excuse me?

15:45.612 --> 15:46.846
Come on, Dan.

15:46.879 --> 15:48.415
Helping us out with that
overtime thing in the garage.

15:48.448 --> 15:49.616
That was good.

15:49.649 --> 15:53.220
But this antique hubcap
thing, that's ridiculous.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.187
Yeah, well.

15:54.221 --> 15:55.322
Besides, we don't need any.

15:55.355 --> 15:59.659
Mrs. Conner just made us
$50 on that salt shaker.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.094
Well, you figured
out what we were

16:01.128 --> 16:03.363
doing down at the garage, huh?
- Come on, Dan.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.465
What do you think I am, stupid?

16:05.498 --> 16:06.366
Remember, Dan.

16:06.399 --> 16:07.200
We're guests here.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.540
Don't tell Becky that
I told you guys this,

16:13.573 --> 16:16.109
but she feels like, for
the past couple of years,

16:16.143 --> 16:17.977
well, you guys,
you've given us a lot.

16:18.011 --> 16:18.878
Well, hey.

16:18.911 --> 16:20.280
We're family, you know?

16:20.313 --> 16:22.315
It's not like we're keeping some
running tab of how much you owe

16:22.349 --> 16:24.217
us in our top dresser drawer.

16:28.721 --> 16:30.657
And with your baby
coming and everything,

16:30.690 --> 16:33.626
she feels like she doesn't want
to be a drain on you anymore.

16:33.660 --> 16:35.895
Why didn't you
just tell us that?

16:35.928 --> 16:39.566
Well, see, Becky told
me that, well, you guys,

16:39.599 --> 16:42.735
you know, you love her so much
that you'd insist on helping,

16:42.769 --> 16:45.672
even if you couldn't afford to.

16:45.705 --> 16:47.740
Becky said that?

16:47.774 --> 16:49.142
Yeah.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.978
Got some water.

16:52.011 --> 16:55.248
Oh, Becky, that's so sweet.

16:55.282 --> 16:58.151
[music playing]

17:04.191 --> 17:07.627
I can't believe how much
stuff we're hauling out of here.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.662
Remember that hamster you
lost when you were eight?

17:09.696 --> 17:11.764
I think I found him.

17:11.798 --> 17:13.166
Ew.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.834
I always blamed
that smell on Becky.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.773
Well, he won't be running
that wheel anytime soon.

17:23.376 --> 17:26.346
Isn't it weird to see this
place all cleaned out?

17:26.379 --> 17:30.483
Like the only thing left of
you girls is that Wrigley Field

17:30.517 --> 17:31.784
sign up there.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.019
Will you get that down for me?

17:41.228 --> 17:45.098
It seems like this sign's
been up there forever.

17:45.132 --> 17:49.202
Yeah, well, that
gum really holds.

17:49.236 --> 17:52.105
Man, everything in this
house sure is changing.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.973
It's Kind of sad.

17:54.006 --> 17:55.375
Well, not
everything's changing.

17:55.408 --> 17:58.511
I mean, we still got your dad
and the furniture and D.J.'s

17:58.545 --> 17:59.346
haircut.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.986
Are you OK with this?

18:07.019 --> 18:09.356
I mean, another one of
your kids moving out?

18:09.389 --> 18:10.690
Yeah.
Yeah.

18:10.723 --> 18:11.591
I'm OK.

18:11.624 --> 18:14.194
Yeah.

18:14.227 --> 18:16.129
I mean, I always knew you
guys were going to move out,

18:16.163 --> 18:18.998
I just was hoping you wouldn't
tell me where you were going.

18:24.070 --> 18:25.538
Can I ask you
something, Darlene?

18:25.572 --> 18:26.373
What?

18:29.342 --> 18:36.349
Do you ever feel like your dad
and me didn't give you enough?

18:36.383 --> 18:37.817
What are you talking about?

18:37.850 --> 18:38.718
You didn't give us anything.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.691
No, I'm serious.

18:44.724 --> 18:46.559
Do you ever resent,
like, not having a lot

18:46.593 --> 18:48.895
of stuff when you were younger?
- No.

18:48.928 --> 18:52.932
I used to steal a lot.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.534
Oh, come on, mom.

18:54.567 --> 18:57.136
You guys were great parents.

18:57.170 --> 19:01.073
Yeah, well, we did have
that one book and all.

19:01.107 --> 19:02.309
I know you did
the best you could.

19:02.342 --> 19:05.144
I mean, kids are expensive.

19:05.178 --> 19:07.547
I mean, your food budget alone
must have gone up by a tenth

19:07.580 --> 19:09.949
after you had us.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.784
[laughs]

19:11.818 --> 19:13.085
I'm just worried
maybe we didn't give

19:13.119 --> 19:15.622
you a good enough head start.

19:15.655 --> 19:16.956
You know?

19:16.989 --> 19:22.094
I always wanted to have our
kids do better than we did.

19:22.128 --> 19:25.465
And that should have
been a realistic goal.

19:25.498 --> 19:30.069
Becky just is taking
such a hard road.

19:30.102 --> 19:31.904
She's going to be fine.

19:31.938 --> 19:33.973
I mean, she's
strong, like you are.

19:34.006 --> 19:37.043
And that will get her through
whatever she has to go through.

19:37.076 --> 19:38.278
You think?

19:38.311 --> 19:40.347
Yeah, definitely.

19:40.380 --> 19:42.582
So what if Becky is
living in a trailer?

19:42.615 --> 19:44.183
It's not like she's used
to living in luxury.

19:44.217 --> 19:47.854
You did that much for her.

19:47.887 --> 19:50.022
Yeah, it was a crazy plan
when we came up with it,

19:50.056 --> 19:51.123
but it really worked.

19:54.227 --> 19:56.028
You know, Darlene,
me and your dad

19:56.062 --> 19:58.030
don't say this to you very
often because, well, it

19:58.064 --> 19:59.266
never comes up.

19:59.299 --> 20:02.802
But we're really proud of you.

20:02.835 --> 20:05.137
Even though I'm secretly
a high priced call girl?

20:09.309 --> 20:11.278
Because you're
a high priced one.

20:15.882 --> 20:16.749
What the hell.

20:16.783 --> 20:17.650
Put that back up.

20:25.658 --> 20:28.495
[music playing]

20:36.002 --> 20:37.504
Watch it, buddy.

20:37.537 --> 20:40.273
I'm sorry, Mr. Fishman.

20:40.307 --> 20:41.408
Pew, fired.

20:47.847 --> 20:50.216
You sent for me, Mr. Fishman?

20:50.249 --> 20:51.250
Hey, baby.

20:51.284 --> 20:56.489
Come sit down next
to Uncle Mike.

20:56.523 --> 21:00.059
You know, I had a really
good time working on the show

21:00.092 --> 21:01.127
this week.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.562
You're sweet, kid.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.364
You know, later this
season, the Conners

21:04.397 --> 21:06.299
are going to get a French maid.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.334
Really?

21:07.367 --> 21:08.468
Yeah.

21:08.501 --> 21:12.305
Of course, I have to see
you in a uniform first.

21:12.339 --> 21:14.040
ROSEANNE: Hey, Fishman,
I'm not telling you again.

21:14.073 --> 21:15.708
Keep your paws off
the guest stars.

21:22.048 --> 21:24.417
There's a whole
lot of man walking

21:24.451 --> 21:27.654
out that door right now.

21:27.687 --> 21:30.723
He'll break your heart.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.525
Trust me.

21:32.559 --> 21:35.428
I've been there.

21:35.462 --> 21:38.731
[music playing]
