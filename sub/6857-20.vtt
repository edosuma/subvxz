00:16.897 --> 00:18.842
<i>Calm before the storm!</i>

00:19.170 --> 00:21.389
<i>A rare and welcome respite
from endless battle</i>

00:21.515 --> 00:24.745
<i>awaits Jedi knights
Anakin Skywalker and Mace Windu</i>

00:24.945 --> 00:28.423
<i>as they travel through deep space
aboard the Jedi cruiser Endurance.</i>

00:28.547 --> 00:30.655
<i>Preparing to rendezvous
with a Republic frigate,</i>

00:31.045 --> 00:33.958
<i>the Jedi remain unaware
of a deadly peril</i>

00:34.167 --> 00:35.783
<i>lying hidden in their midst.</i>

00:36.449 --> 00:39.065
War does not come with a guarantee.

00:40.012 --> 00:43.659
No soldier gets the promise of safety,
survival or victory.

00:44.638 --> 00:47.509
But men, I guarantee you this.

00:47.998 --> 00:50.655
Every member
of this clone youth brigade

00:50.832 --> 00:52.928
will have his moment.

00:53.301 --> 00:56.634
And it is that moment
when you are no longer a cadet,

00:57.444 --> 00:59.523
you are a soldier.

01:00.642 --> 01:02.308
It's the Jedi cruiser.

01:03.422 --> 01:05.713
You have the best training
in the galaxy,

01:05.880 --> 01:07.833
but no-one can train you
for the moment

01:07.957 --> 01:09.674
you look death in the eyes.

01:09.840 --> 01:11.621
What you do then

01:12.059 --> 01:13.988
and the soldier you become,

01:14.289 --> 01:16.303
that is up to you.

01:17.729 --> 01:19.971
Docking procedures begin shortly.

01:20.218 --> 01:22.178
Until then, dismissed!

01:35.636 --> 01:37.790
Who's the new guy,
with the long hair?

01:37.915 --> 01:39.948
Some last-minute replacement.

01:40.392 --> 01:41.852
Looks green to me.

01:46.771 --> 01:48.146
What outfit are you from?

01:48.273 --> 01:49.314
322nd.

01:49.834 --> 01:51.469
I heard they had that tour.

01:51.594 --> 01:52.637
They did.

01:53.721 --> 01:55.214
I couldn't make it.

01:55.338 --> 01:58.028
- Broken arm.
- A real trooper could lose an arm

01:58.370 --> 01:59.935
and still report for duty.

02:00.059 --> 02:01.530
So, what are you, soft?

02:02.021 --> 02:03.783
What's going on here, gentlemen?

02:03.907 --> 02:05.412
Just having a little fun.

02:05.538 --> 02:07.408
I've seen your kind of fun,
hot shot.

02:07.575 --> 02:08.669
Stand down.

02:09.358 --> 02:12.589
Come on, Whip,
the air's getting stale around here.

02:14.210 --> 02:15.396
What's your name?

02:15.520 --> 02:17.083
- I'm Lucky.
- Jax.

02:17.424 --> 02:19.809
Thanks,
but I can handle myself.

02:20.255 --> 02:23.878
Sure, but a trooper's only as strong
as the trooper beside him.

02:24.002 --> 02:26.515
- We're all in it together, right?
- Right.

02:26.641 --> 02:29.835
And with the training we've got,
I feel ready for anything.

03:02.939 --> 03:03.981
Man!

03:16.564 --> 03:17.864
Don't be nervous.

03:17.989 --> 03:20.648
Only thing between us and them
is experience.

03:21.247 --> 03:22.983
It's not like they're Jedi.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.540
Morning, troops.

03:31.667 --> 03:34.029
Welcome aboard the Jedi cruiser
Endurance.

03:34.206 --> 03:37.531
- I am Mace Windu. And this is...
- Anakin Skywalker.

03:37.726 --> 03:38.780
Welcome aboard.

03:39.221 --> 03:42.922
Today you'll see how a real,
working Jedi cruiser operates.

03:43.127 --> 03:46.701
You'll have the chance to serve right
alongside two Jedi knights.

03:46.869 --> 03:47.676
Serious?

03:47.800 --> 03:50.144
- That's wicked!
- We're gonna get training!

03:51.238 --> 03:53.754
New orders from General Kenobi
await you in the war room.

03:53.878 --> 03:55.025
Immediately.

03:56.351 --> 03:57.861
Another time, then.

04:11.116 --> 04:13.680
You seem more disappointed
than our cadets.

04:13.804 --> 04:16.289
It's our job
to instruct and inspire.

04:16.415 --> 04:18.394
You just wanted to show off.

04:18.891 --> 04:21.237
When I show off, it is instructive.

04:21.820 --> 04:23.202
And inspiring.

04:23.386 --> 04:24.688
For you, maybe.

04:34.150 --> 04:35.765
Looks easy, doesn't it?

04:35.889 --> 04:37.912
Well, looks can be deceiving.

04:38.036 --> 04:41.757
There's nothing more dangerous
in all of space than a moving target.

04:41.881 --> 04:43.435
What do you use for targets, sir?

04:43.561 --> 04:45.228
Malfunctioning droids.

04:47.984 --> 04:50.730
Mechanical skeet
packed with explosives.

04:50.896 --> 04:53.900
Now, this is my ship and my rules.

04:54.232 --> 04:56.421
I do not allow tourists onboard.

04:56.851 --> 04:58.102
Only soldiers.

04:58.424 --> 05:00.508
Now, time for target practice.

05:01.486 --> 05:03.259
You there, take the gun.

05:25.387 --> 05:27.163
Not even close.
Next.

05:27.504 --> 05:29.213
- But I only...
- You're done.

05:29.338 --> 05:31.061
You only get one chance.

05:31.187 --> 05:34.532
I promise you
the Separatists don't give more. Next.

05:49.537 --> 05:51.424
Near miss is still a miss, kid.

05:51.591 --> 05:52.856
Sergeant's right.

05:52.981 --> 05:55.030
Training is no match for experience

05:55.154 --> 05:57.812
and it's the one thing
none of you have.

06:01.222 --> 06:02.630
I know that look.

06:19.300 --> 06:21.386
I see why they call you Lucky.

06:22.014 --> 06:26.119
Let's see how you are when Seppies
come at you in attack formation.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.974
All right,
cut the chatter, men.

06:40.099 --> 06:41.739
We're due at Observation Deck 13.

06:41.987 --> 06:43.031
Fall out!

06:46.907 --> 06:48.939
Now, that's a cadet to watch.

06:49.802 --> 06:51.210
Cadet 1151,

06:51.695 --> 06:54.880
tell me where this Jedi Cruiser's
main stabilisers are.

06:55.759 --> 06:58.162
Hull 17 behind the main reactor,
sir.

06:58.329 --> 06:59.371
Good.

06:59.830 --> 07:00.924
Cadet 1174,

07:01.595 --> 07:04.831
how many engines fail
before auxiliary power kicks in?

07:05.619 --> 07:08.173
Three on port
and starboard side, sir.

07:16.986 --> 07:18.400
Channel-7 open.

07:18.531 --> 07:21.032
Ready to receive
Code-5 transmission.

07:22.498 --> 07:23.957
<i>Boba, is that you?</i>

07:24.082 --> 07:25.001
It is.

07:25.127 --> 07:27.159
<i>I'm sending you the data now.</i>

07:34.426 --> 07:35.856
Received transmission.

07:35.981 --> 07:37.022
Boba out.

07:38.588 --> 07:40.354
What are you doing here?

07:40.478 --> 07:42.511
Communiques, sir. Eyes only.

07:42.888 --> 07:45.536
I've been dispatched
to General Windu's quarters.

07:45.662 --> 07:47.005
There's no problem, sir.

07:47.377 --> 07:48.838
There's a problem.

07:49.346 --> 07:50.545
You're lying.

07:57.439 --> 07:58.480
Admit it.

07:59.069 --> 08:00.189
You're lost.

08:01.387 --> 08:03.016
Come on, cut the kid a break.

08:03.140 --> 08:05.425
Windu's quarters are that way,
shiny.

08:05.426 --> 08:07.510
Yes, sir.
Thank you, sir.

08:51.549 --> 08:53.638
Eyes on where you're headed, cadet.

08:53.952 --> 08:56.349
Yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.

09:13.378 --> 09:14.420
Cadet 327.

09:16.412 --> 09:19.639
What reaction propels
the main engines of this Jedi cruiser?

09:19.765 --> 09:22.609
Post-combined sparking
off the reactor core rods, sir.

09:23.664 --> 09:24.527
Excellent.

09:29.141 --> 09:31.949
General Skywalker
requests your presence on the bridge.

09:32.073 --> 09:33.741
I'll be there shortly.

09:36.509 --> 09:40.034
The General requests your presence
immediately, sir.

09:40.341 --> 09:42.007
No rest for the weary.

09:42.494 --> 09:45.150
Put these inside my quarters,
would you?

10:03.468 --> 10:05.760
Are you all right?
Trooper! Trooper!

10:10.263 --> 10:12.423
This doesn't look like a drill.

10:15.320 --> 10:17.801
No time for chatter.
There's been an explosion.

10:18.376 --> 10:21.698
Let's show these troops how the clone
youth brigade rises to the challenge.

10:21.824 --> 10:22.678
Line up.

10:23.734 --> 10:25.220
I don't want any heroes.

10:26.131 --> 10:27.763
Get to the nearest safe room.

10:27.930 --> 10:30.535
Let these troops do their job!
Now, move!

10:32.741 --> 10:35.162
- Think it's a Seppy attack?
- Out here?

10:35.289 --> 10:37.732
- The perfect place for it.
- You heard the Sergeant.

10:37.859 --> 10:39.523
Secure the loose talk.

10:42.683 --> 10:43.980
Status report, trooper.

10:44.145 --> 10:46.147
The ship's undamaged. One man down.

10:46.320 --> 10:48.814
General Windu's quarters got hit
but he survived.

10:49.291 --> 10:50.333
Survived?

10:58.629 --> 11:00.452
You're lucky to be alive.

11:00.708 --> 11:01.856
Our trooper?

11:01.980 --> 11:03.022
Dead.

11:04.039 --> 11:05.477
This was no accident.

11:05.601 --> 11:06.643
Agreed.

11:08.217 --> 11:09.363
Keep moving!

11:28.264 --> 11:30.453
The ship's navigation is nearby.

11:30.809 --> 11:33.417
Admiral,
has the navigation been damaged?

11:33.740 --> 11:35.795
Puddled, not destroyed.

11:36.078 --> 11:37.407
Systems are repairable.

11:37.531 --> 11:41.303
I've ordered shutdown of all engines
until we're fully operational.

11:41.427 --> 11:43.130
We'll hold orbit over Vanqor.

11:43.297 --> 11:44.672
Any sign of attack ships?

11:44.940 --> 11:46.805
None. But we'll keep scanning.

11:46.931 --> 11:48.599
Until we get navigation back,

11:48.726 --> 11:51.009
the Endurance is
a fat and easy target.

11:51.196 --> 11:53.228
I won't have it! Killian out.

11:54.863 --> 11:56.604
Navigation wasn't the target,

11:56.729 --> 11:59.120
and hitting your quarters
was intentional.

12:06.438 --> 12:09.174
This is Boba.
It's a miss, repeat, a miss.

12:09.300 --> 12:10.470
What should I do?

12:10.596 --> 12:12.993
<i>Head to the reactor.
Blow the core.</i>

12:13.117 --> 12:15.410
But the crew...
It isn't about them,

12:15.733 --> 12:16.775
just Mace.

12:17.855 --> 12:20.356
<i>If you want Windu dead,
do as I say!</i>

12:23.237 --> 12:26.608
We have a killer on board this ship
and we are locked in dead space.

12:26.774 --> 12:28.234
Just like our assassin.

12:28.360 --> 12:30.240
We'll form
an unbroken line of troopers

12:30.364 --> 12:32.167
and scour the ship
from bow to stern,

12:32.293 --> 12:34.736
checking every corridor,
bulkhead and storage unit.

12:35.095 --> 12:37.233
I want him alive.

12:54.235 --> 12:55.852
You there! Come here.

12:57.753 --> 12:59.108
I got lost, sir.

12:59.582 --> 13:01.610
The ship's on full lockdown, son.

13:02.707 --> 13:03.639
I know, sir.

13:03.764 --> 13:05.917
I just...
I'll return to my company.

13:06.574 --> 13:07.835
Not alone, you won't.

13:09.399 --> 13:11.086
Emergency protocols are in effect.

13:11.212 --> 13:13.336
I'll call a trooper to escort you
out of here.

13:13.505 --> 13:15.338
This is CT-1477.

13:15.778 --> 13:17.714
- I need an escort...
- Is that a DC-15A?

13:19.049 --> 13:20.465
Here, keep the safety on.

13:21.255 --> 13:23.217
<i>Copy that, CT-1477.</i>

13:23.382 --> 13:26.342
<i>We're pretty overloaded
with the emergency status,</i>

13:26.467 --> 13:28.211
<i>but we'll get someone there soon.</i>

13:28.336 --> 13:29.378
What?!

13:33.680 --> 13:34.847
What are you doing?

13:36.389 --> 13:38.307
We're brothers.
Don't shoot.

13:38.659 --> 13:40.225
You're not my brother.

13:40.942 --> 13:42.090
Don't shoot!

13:42.459 --> 13:43.423
Don't worry.

13:46.991 --> 13:48.479
<i>CT-1477, report in.</i>

13:50.880 --> 13:53.563
<i>CT-1477,
why have you broken off transmission?</i>

14:09.172 --> 14:11.626
Our sweep has now covered
over half the ship, Admiral.

14:11.752 --> 14:13.836
Still no sign of the assassin.

14:14.100 --> 14:17.490
The more ground we cover,
the less there is in which to hide.

14:47.435 --> 14:50.037
More action than you signed on for,
eh, boys?

14:50.162 --> 14:51.918
We're headed
for the safe room now, sir.

14:52.042 --> 14:52.833
Fine.

14:53.020 --> 14:56.003
Although, on second thoughts,
let's make a drill of it.

14:56.366 --> 14:57.524
Head for the pods.

14:58.192 --> 14:59.955
Escape pods? It must be bad.

15:00.081 --> 15:01.551
Escape pods, sir?

15:02.673 --> 15:05.443
I wanna see what they're made of.
I'll even time you.

15:06.486 --> 15:09.475
It'll all make a fine story
when you return to your base.

15:09.600 --> 15:12.066
- This can't be happening.
- Get a hold of yourself.

15:12.192 --> 15:14.152
Prepare to launch
the distress beacon.

15:14.278 --> 15:15.489
We're going down.

15:20.065 --> 15:22.868
Get your men out of here.
There's nothing more you can do.

15:23.267 --> 15:26.287
R2, prep the fighters
and be ready to take off.

15:39.821 --> 15:41.668
Lucky!
Stay with the group.

15:47.487 --> 15:49.064
How are we gonna get through this?

15:49.188 --> 15:51.086
Groups of four men. Groups of four.

15:51.212 --> 15:52.358
Take pods 1 and 2.

15:52.484 --> 15:54.497
Set rendezvous coordinates
with the other pods

15:54.621 --> 15:57.017
at a safe distance from the cruiser.

15:57.694 --> 15:59.718
See you at rendezvous mark six.

16:00.783 --> 16:02.375
This is the moment, men.

16:02.501 --> 16:03.751
Make it yours.

16:17.219 --> 16:18.892
The pod's malfunctioned.

16:19.299 --> 16:21.243
The main reactor's beyond hope.

16:21.368 --> 16:23.192
You have to abandon ship.

16:23.694 --> 16:25.581
You must abandon ship.

16:25.820 --> 16:26.966
I'm staying.

16:32.565 --> 16:34.368
We missed the rendezvous.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.776
I can't stop it!

16:38.895 --> 16:41.239
I'm staying with the admiral.
You'd better evacuate.

16:42.189 --> 16:44.324
Admiral, you must abandon ship.

16:44.815 --> 16:45.989
Not a chance.

16:46.154 --> 16:49.184
But sir,
with respect, that's an order!

16:49.308 --> 16:52.410
It may be your command, General,
but it's my ship!

16:52.536 --> 16:54.533
We don't have time
for that kind of sentiment!

16:54.833 --> 16:58.513
It's not sentiment!
An admiral must go down with his ship!

16:59.303 --> 17:02.066
I don't expect you
to understand it, Jedi.

17:06.965 --> 17:07.915
We're lost.

17:09.565 --> 17:12.165
What happened?
Do we still have control?

17:13.016 --> 17:14.326
Navigation's shot.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.542
Looks like our pod was damaged
in the escape.

17:16.970 --> 17:18.165
Can we steer?

17:19.961 --> 17:21.263
How about fuel?

17:21.615 --> 17:22.657
No feed.

17:23.031 --> 17:24.395
We're dead weight.

17:24.519 --> 17:25.979
So, what do we do?

17:26.498 --> 17:27.905
Our jobs.

17:32.258 --> 17:34.969
Get ready
to attach the hyperspace rings.

17:45.711 --> 17:47.223
Admiral, what's your status?

17:47.692 --> 17:50.106
<i>We're caught in Vanqor's
gravitational pull.</i>

17:53.770 --> 17:56.018
We're going to try to
set her down on the surface.

18:00.728 --> 18:03.567
All right. Once you're down, we'll
get the rescue teams to your location.

18:03.691 --> 18:06.456
<i>- General Skywalker?
- Yes, Sergeant?</i>

18:08.278 --> 18:11.485
It's the cadets, sir.
I can't raise them on any channel,

18:11.612 --> 18:13.482
and their locater beacon's
not active.

18:13.608 --> 18:16.068
Theirs is the only pod
unaccounted for.

18:16.325 --> 18:20.062
Sounds like our saboteur
may have gotten to the cadets.

18:20.383 --> 18:22.198
We have to find that pod.

18:27.983 --> 18:29.992
- What was that?
- I don't know.

18:30.275 --> 18:31.631
A ship, I think.

18:37.268 --> 18:38.415
Rescue ship?

18:38.866 --> 18:40.168
It's too early.

18:40.819 --> 18:41.966
What the...?

18:53.295 --> 18:54.911
What do we have here?

19:00.189 --> 19:01.700
You boys look lost.

19:03.931 --> 19:05.599
Congratulations, Boba.

19:06.068 --> 19:07.519
Job well done.

19:08.761 --> 19:10.067
His name's not Boba.

19:10.191 --> 19:11.285
He's Lucky.

19:11.625 --> 19:12.668
Lucky?!

19:14.559 --> 19:15.805
That's a good one.

19:16.668 --> 19:17.889
You're with her?!

19:18.655 --> 19:21.183
I wasn't expecting you
to bring friends along.

19:21.522 --> 19:23.398
I couldn't help it, Aurra.

19:23.543 --> 19:25.350
What are you gonna do with them?

19:25.691 --> 19:27.151
What do you think?

19:27.843 --> 19:28.990
Let them go?

19:31.333 --> 19:32.937
They're living witnesses, honey.

19:35.024 --> 19:36.896
That was never part of the plan.

19:37.020 --> 19:39.606
I just wanted to kill the Jedi
that murdered my father.

19:39.980 --> 19:41.627
That will have to wait.

19:41.754 --> 19:42.795
Grow up!

19:43.068 --> 19:45.193
You'll get your revenge in time.

19:47.122 --> 19:48.319
Now, get onboard.

19:48.486 --> 19:49.865
We have to get out of here.

19:49.991 --> 19:52.144
Or you can go with your friends,

19:52.269 --> 19:55.082
who I'm going to jettison
into the unknown.

19:56.372 --> 19:57.988
That would be poetic.

20:02.038 --> 20:03.080
I'm sorry.

20:06.084 --> 20:07.126
Traitor!

20:15.841 --> 20:16.883
Do it!

20:19.334 --> 20:20.833
You'll regret this!

20:36.510 --> 20:38.643
I can't believe it.
A traitor?

20:38.769 --> 20:40.228
He was a traitor?!

20:40.877 --> 20:42.556
We can't worry about that
right now.

20:42.680 --> 20:44.595
We have to find a way
to contact somebody.

20:45.207 --> 20:47.552
We already tried. This pod is dead!

20:48.152 --> 20:50.373
We only have minimal life support.

20:50.497 --> 20:52.687
Whose fault is that? None of us!

20:53.562 --> 20:55.841
That guy you defended
left us for dead!

20:55.967 --> 20:58.188
Stop it! We need to work together.

20:58.315 --> 21:00.033
You're not in charge...

21:02.511 --> 21:05.014
They have come back
to finish us off.

21:05.440 --> 21:06.938
Wait.
It's the Jedi!

21:11.636 --> 21:13.495
I've found your missing cadets.

21:13.620 --> 21:15.810
<i>Nice work, General.
How are they?</i>

21:15.934 --> 21:17.729
I can't raise them
on the comm channel.

21:17.855 --> 21:20.152
Their pod must have been damaged
in the evacuation.

21:20.330 --> 21:23.144
<i>Head to point 038
and you can pick 'em up.</i>

21:23.458 --> 21:24.530
Right away, sir.

21:24.695 --> 21:27.406
Skywalker,
have you heard from Admiral Killian?

21:28.562 --> 21:31.033
I lost contact
when they entered the atmosphere.

21:36.288 --> 21:40.017
- I'm sorry. I lost my head. I...
- It's OK. I understand.

21:40.478 --> 21:42.216
I can't believe he was one of us.

21:42.342 --> 21:44.042
Someone just like us.

21:44.287 --> 21:45.902
He's nothing like us!

21:46.389 --> 21:47.797
Let's hope he is.

21:48.207 --> 21:49.614
If he is like us,

21:50.159 --> 21:51.983
he'll realise he's wrong.
