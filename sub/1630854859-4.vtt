26:49.330 --> 26:50.740
You disabled the comms
before you left,

26:50.940 --> 26:53.920
so they didn't know
that you borrowed it.

26:54.120 --> 26:57.230
We were dead in the water.

26:57.430 --> 27:00.140
But we improvised a system.

27:00.340 --> 27:02.150
Swap the remaining power

27:02.350 --> 27:04.240
between docking thrusters

27:04.430 --> 27:06.630
and life support.

27:06.830 --> 27:09.710
Then we inched our way home.

27:11.060 --> 27:12.810
No sensors,

27:13.010 --> 27:14.630
no visuals.

27:16.890 --> 27:20.070
Ten fucking grueling hours.

27:22.330 --> 27:24.950
He and I in sync, though.
Him navigating,

27:25.150 --> 27:27.080
me firing the thrusters,

27:27.280 --> 27:30.700
simply hoping, until, finally,

27:30.900 --> 27:32.520
we were home.

27:38.170 --> 27:41.220
Did your mother already
tell you this story?

27:43.130 --> 27:44.970
Actually, uh...

27:45.170 --> 27:47.920
What a harrowing tale
of survival.

27:49.530 --> 27:52.680
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to interrupt family time.

27:52.870 --> 27:55.630
I may be a little out of sorts.

27:55.830 --> 27:57.380
Your mother's pretty liberal

27:57.570 --> 28:00.640
with those pain meds.

28:00.840 --> 28:04.080
But, uh, speaking
of harrowing stories...

28:04.280 --> 28:06.430
[grunts]

28:06.630 --> 28:07.990
Did your old man ever tell you

28:08.190 --> 28:09.860
about the time
that he and I first met?

28:12.770 --> 28:15.610
USS <i>Constance.</i>

28:15.810 --> 28:18.740
Stardate 44002.3.

28:22.480 --> 28:25.710
Oh, come on.
You must've heard about

28:25.910 --> 28:28.190
the Battle of Wolf 359.

28:28.390 --> 28:31.020
40 Federation starships

28:31.220 --> 28:34.500
up against one Borg cube.

28:34.700 --> 28:37.280
Yeah, I was just in engineering.

28:37.480 --> 28:40.770
Just a... a grease monkey.

28:40.970 --> 28:43.460
And the next second...

28:43.660 --> 28:45.330
[mouths]

28:46.630 --> 28:49.340
It's like...

28:49.540 --> 28:50.910
it's like space itself
was burning.

28:51.110 --> 28:53.210
<i>[explosions booming]</i>

28:53.410 --> 28:56.340
50 of us made it down
to the life deck.

28:57.640 --> 28:59.830
But, uh-oh...

29:00.030 --> 29:02.270
there's just one life pod.

29:02.470 --> 29:03.650
Ten seats.

29:05.650 --> 29:07.140
Now, the thing is, we were

29:07.340 --> 29:08.620
all friends,

29:08.820 --> 29:11.010
they were all my Jack Crusher.

29:12.620 --> 29:14.370
We weren't...

29:14.560 --> 29:17.540
we didn't fight over who
should live and who should die.

29:17.740 --> 29:20.370
No, we... we waited for orders.

29:20.570 --> 29:22.240
And then, finally,

29:22.440 --> 29:25.900
some lieutenant comes down,
and she just starts...

29:26.100 --> 29:28.420
pointing.

29:28.620 --> 29:30.600
You, you,

29:30.800 --> 29:32.590
and you.

29:34.290 --> 29:36.330
Now she's pointing at me.

29:39.290 --> 29:41.470
Why-why me?

29:43.120 --> 29:45.780
I'm just some dipshit
from Chicago.

29:47.480 --> 29:48.880
Now I'm...

29:49.080 --> 29:51.220
lucky number ten.

29:53.260 --> 29:54.930
She didn't count herself.

29:55.130 --> 29:57.410
"Get in," she says,
"that's an order."

29:57.610 --> 29:59.800
I know, I know, I know.

30:00.000 --> 30:01.800
I ask myself the same thing.

30:04.840 --> 30:07.020
She make a mistake?

30:10.280 --> 30:11.810
I'm sorry.

30:14.020 --> 30:17.380
11,000 dead.

30:17.580 --> 30:20.120
<i>[people screaming]</i>

30:22.820 --> 30:26.390
Do you know where
your old man was

30:26.590 --> 30:28.130
on that day?

30:30.430 --> 30:33.310
<i>PICARD:</i>
<i>I am Locutus of Borg.</i>

30:33.510 --> 30:35.580
SHAW:
He was on that Borg cube,

30:35.780 --> 30:38.930
setting the world on fire!

30:39.130 --> 30:42.850
Forget about all that weird shit
on the <i>Stargazer.</i>

30:43.040 --> 30:44.240
The real Borg

30:44.440 --> 30:45.980
are still out there.

30:46.180 --> 30:48.110
And they have a name for you.

30:48.310 --> 30:51.110
Locutus of Borg.

30:52.500 --> 30:53.380
The only Borg

30:53.580 --> 30:55.730
so deadly

30:55.930 --> 30:57.900
they gave him a goddamn name.

30:58.100 --> 31:00.110
- All right, that's enough.
- No.

31:03.900 --> 31:05.380
No.

31:08.080 --> 31:09.560
It's all right.

31:19.260 --> 31:21.570
I understand.

31:23.530 --> 31:26.580
Computer. Arch.

31:48.340 --> 31:50.390
Forgive me.

31:50.590 --> 31:52.260
At some point,

31:52.460 --> 31:55.000
asshole became
a substitute for charm.

32:03.530 --> 32:06.140
Hey, um, Admiral.

32:07.570 --> 32:09.410
Look, what happened back there--

32:09.610 --> 32:11.850
you don't need to explain
yourself to me.

32:12.050 --> 32:13.810
Thank you for your time, Jack.

32:14.010 --> 32:16.150
It meant a lot to me.

32:17.630 --> 32:19.900
BEVERLY:
Jack. Jean-Luc.

32:20.100 --> 32:21.680
There's a pattern.

32:21.880 --> 32:23.550
It's building and building,
and it's going to crescendo.

32:23.750 --> 32:25.340
- What are you talking about?
- This.

32:25.540 --> 32:26.910
This-this gravity well we're in.

32:27.110 --> 32:28.820
It's drawing in matter

32:29.020 --> 32:31.080
and expelling energy,
which means

32:31.280 --> 32:34.090
somewhere in its center,
it is reconstituting the matter

32:34.290 --> 32:36.130
it consumes into energy.

32:36.330 --> 32:38.440
But energy is mathematical,
logarithmic,

32:38.640 --> 32:40.750
but the increasing intensity

32:40.940 --> 32:42.920
and narrowing frequency
of the waves

32:43.120 --> 32:44.780
implies something else.

32:46.610 --> 32:49.750
It's a countdown.
Which led me to track them,

32:49.950 --> 32:51.710
just like contractions.

32:51.910 --> 32:54.660
Contractions?
You mean like a birth?

32:55.880 --> 32:57.680
- Of what?
- I don't know.

32:57.870 --> 33:00.680
But if it's anything
like these smaller waves,

33:00.880 --> 33:04.160
once it hits, for us,
it will be over quickly.

33:04.360 --> 33:06.950
Yeah. We need to be out
of here as soon as possible.

33:07.150 --> 33:08.430
But we have no power.

33:08.620 --> 33:11.470
We do when those waves hit.

33:11.670 --> 33:12.860
You've seen the lights?

33:14.600 --> 33:16.300
If we knew when
those waves were coming,

33:16.500 --> 33:18.440
maybe we could plug into them.

33:18.630 --> 33:20.050
Get a little extra juice,
and then...

33:20.250 --> 33:23.780
We could hitch a ride
out of here.

33:27.650 --> 33:29.100
This cannot work.

33:29.300 --> 33:30.750
The wave's rolling
right over the ship.

33:30.950 --> 33:33.230
- We'd need to somehow
sustain contact.
- Yes,

33:33.430 --> 33:34.580
we need to move with the waves.

33:34.780 --> 33:37.190
We divert all power
to thrusters.

33:37.390 --> 33:39.500
And if we fly fast enough,
the waves

33:39.700 --> 33:41.550
won't roll over us,
they will absorb us.

33:41.740 --> 33:45.160
We match speed with the wave,
use the energy drawn from it

33:45.360 --> 33:47.770
and, Bob's your uncle, Fanny's
your aunt, we hightail it

33:47.970 --> 33:49.340
out the nebula,
away from the gravity well,

33:49.540 --> 33:51.160
away from that ship out there

33:51.360 --> 33:54.030
- and away from our new friends
the space babies.
- Jack.

33:55.120 --> 33:57.040
- Space babies?
- BEVERLY: This nebula is a womb,

33:57.240 --> 33:59.560
and we are swimming
in its amniotic fluid.

33:59.760 --> 34:01.910
Now, we've encountered
species before--

34:02.110 --> 34:05.000
life-forms that thrive

34:05.200 --> 34:07.050
- in the vacuum of space.
- Farpoint.

34:07.250 --> 34:08.960
- Exactly.
- Yeah, t-this is insane.

34:09.160 --> 34:10.490
To get up to speed, we need to

34:10.690 --> 34:12.100
fire thrusters,
which will drain

34:12.300 --> 34:13.580
- life support in minutes.
- PICARD: But it's possible

34:13.780 --> 34:15.880
that we could absorb
some of that energy.

34:16.080 --> 34:18.890
- Use it.
- What about the asteroid field
that's out there?

34:19.090 --> 34:20.410
We barely have enough sensors
to make it through that.

34:20.610 --> 34:22.670
If one of those hits us,
we've lost the wave.

34:22.870 --> 34:24.280
We navigate manually,

34:24.480 --> 34:26.500
use the docking thrusters
to steer around them.

34:26.700 --> 34:27.850
Like you did.

34:28.050 --> 34:29.510
RIKER:
I know that story, too, kid.

34:29.710 --> 34:31.990
But this is not
a two-man shuttle.

34:32.190 --> 34:33.640
The amount of thought

34:33.840 --> 34:35.030
and orchestration
that this would take--

34:35.230 --> 34:36.820
Starfleet protocol states

34:37.020 --> 34:38.820
that we stay in place
and wait to be rescued.

34:39.020 --> 34:41.390
No one is coming
to rescue us, Will.

34:41.590 --> 34:43.690
The power array will explode.

34:43.890 --> 34:47.080
We wait and we die here
of suffocation.

34:55.220 --> 34:58.220
At least we will have
left something behind.

35:02.140 --> 35:03.800
It's a wonderful idea, Jean-Luc.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.450
But in a moment,
a hundred things could go wrong,

35:08.010 --> 35:11.200
I cannot choose certain death.

35:11.400 --> 35:13.320
BEVERLY:
Deanna.

35:15.150 --> 35:18.120
Deanna would say
it's about trust.

35:18.320 --> 35:19.990
Look where we are. Here.

35:20.190 --> 35:22.680
All of us in this moment.

35:25.250 --> 35:27.040
So let's do what we've spent
our entire lives

35:27.240 --> 35:29.600
learning to be great at.

35:37.780 --> 35:40.050
PICARD:
We've been here before, Will.

35:42.350 --> 35:44.760
If this is the end,

35:44.950 --> 35:46.800
let's face it together.

35:47.000 --> 35:50.270
Doing what we know we do best.

35:53.230 --> 35:54.710
[soft chuckle]

35:58.630 --> 36:03.030
The nacelle covers are designed
to prevent the plasma conduits

36:03.230 --> 36:04.860
from absorbing
too much radiation.

36:05.060 --> 36:07.260
So, if we could manually

36:07.460 --> 36:09.080
open them, we might be able

36:09.280 --> 36:11.130
to channel the energy
from the wave

36:11.330 --> 36:12.650
right down to the warp core.

36:12.850 --> 36:14.040
Now, that could work.

36:16.690 --> 36:17.910
All right, everybody?

36:19.350 --> 36:20.700
Then let's
get the hell out of here.

36:28.180 --> 36:30.180

We have a plan to escape,
but to do so,

36:57.770 --> 37:00.140
we'll need to draw
every ounce of power

37:00.330 --> 37:02.790
that we have left on this ship.

37:02.990 --> 37:07.660

It's a hell of a risk.
