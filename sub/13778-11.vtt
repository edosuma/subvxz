WEBVTT

00:01.001 --> 00:02.912
(siren wails)

00:02.961 --> 00:04.246
The worst part is,

00:04.296 --> 00:06.378
is I wanted Dov and Gail to get along.

00:06.423 --> 00:09.881
I mean, I wanted them to spend
time with each other. Man.

00:09.927 --> 00:12.760
Yeah, well, the minute
I decided to tell Sam

00:12.804 --> 00:15.967
about my feelings,
he's gone, like magic,

00:16.016 --> 00:17.381
really mean magic.

00:17.434 --> 00:18.844
(Man) You're not gonna get away with this!

00:18.894 --> 00:21.226
— Clifton, get back here!
— (Andy) Hey!

00:21.271 --> 00:23.136
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey! Hey!

00:23.190 --> 00:24.805
— Stop! Police!
— Hey!

00:24.858 --> 00:26.894
— (bat clatters)
— (Man) Take it easy, officer.

00:26.944 --> 00:28.059
— Take it easy.
— Give me your hands.

00:28.111 --> 00:30.397
— Ohh. (grunts)
— (handcuffs click)

00:32.991 --> 00:34.982
Ohh. (pants)

00:35.035 --> 00:37.401
You gotta be kidding me.

00:37.454 --> 00:39.285
Look who I just caught.

00:43.835 --> 00:44.870
Did this man attack you?

00:44.920 --> 00:47.252
— Kind of.
— Clifton.

00:47.297 --> 00:51.336
l was just trying
to talk some sense into the boy,

00:51.385 --> 00:53.842
stop him from making
a very serious mistake.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.003
Nah, you were sticking your nose
where it doesn't belong.

00:56.056 --> 00:58.468
That's only 'cause
I believe in you, son.

00:58.517 --> 01:01.975
I run a street program,
and Clifton here,

01:02.020 --> 01:04.136
during the holy sacrament
of confession,

01:04.189 --> 01:06.601
told me something he was gonna do
that was very stupid,

01:06.650 --> 01:08.811
— and I had to step in.
— What'd he say?

01:08.860 --> 01:11.647
I can't share that with you.
I'm bound by an oath.

01:11.697 --> 01:13.653
Yeah, well, we're bound by an oath, too.

01:14.283 --> 01:16.023
He's a priest. He can't be lying.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.408
Pfft. Priests lie.
Ever see that wafer they call bread?

01:18.453 --> 01:20.034
Yeah. Come here.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.411
(grunts)

01:21.456 --> 01:22.832
(handcuffs click)

01:22.874 --> 01:25.832
(sniffles and grunts)

01:25.877 --> 01:29.005
(sniffles) You know it's bad
when you can't believe a priest.

01:29.047 --> 01:31.834
(priest chuckles)
Don't believe in me, brother.

01:31.883 --> 01:34.545
Save it for the Man Upstairs.

01:34.595 --> 01:36.586
God sees the big picture.

01:36.638 --> 01:39.880
Like it or not,
he has a plan for all of us.

01:39.933 --> 01:41.514
Yeah, well, if I'm living God's plan,

01:41.560 --> 01:45.348
you can let him know
that his timing's off, way off.

01:50.402 --> 01:51.892
Absolutely.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.981
Hey. What's, uh—— What's going on?

01:54.031 --> 01:54.986
— Yeah.
— Okay. Okay, fine.

01:55.032 --> 01:56.818
Yeah, no. Keep——Keep walking,

01:56.867 --> 01:58.448
but I didn't do anything wrong,
so I'm done feeling guilty

01:58.493 --> 01:59.903
for something I didn't do.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.695
Chris, come on. It's been weeks.

02:02.748 --> 02:05.239
I mean, you have to get over this.
Nothing happened.

02:05.292 --> 02:07.578
That's not the point, okay?

02:07.628 --> 02:10.791
You let him in.
You went around behind my back,

02:10.839 --> 02:12.750
and you let someone
get close to you.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.175
You and Dov were my family...

02:14.217 --> 02:15.468
And you're mine.

02:15.510 --> 02:18.047
And ljust stood there and let it happen.

02:19.389 --> 02:20.674
(sighs)

02:23.310 --> 02:25.096
Do you believe in anything?

02:26.229 --> 02:27.480
Because of what happened with Luke?

02:27.522 --> 02:30.138
Yes, and Sam...

02:30.192 --> 02:32.274
you know, leaving like that.

02:32.319 --> 02:35.186
(sighs) Well, having faith means

02:35.238 --> 02:37.365
believing in things
that don't always make sense.

02:37.407 --> 02:39.272
Tooth fairy doesn't make sense.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.362
I am the tooth fairy.

02:41.411 --> 02:44.278
Last week, Leo lost a tooth.
Cost me 20 bucks.

02:44.331 --> 02:45.537
20 bucks?

02:45.582 --> 02:47.368
Tooth fairy didn't have any change.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.703
I might not need three, but it'd be good
to have a, you know——

02:49.753 --> 02:53.086
a few fresh faces ready,
people who work the area.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.838
They're totally talking about us.

02:55.884 --> 02:59.342
|——| think | impressed him
with the workbook stuff, so...

02:59.388 --> 03:02.175
Would this have anything to do
with the case Swarek is working?

03:02.224 --> 03:04.465
ls Swarek working on a case? I...

03:04.518 --> 03:06.600
Guy disappeared on me
in the middle of the night,

03:06.645 --> 03:08.931
— nothing but a voice mail.
— (whistles)

03:08.980 --> 03:10.436
Now, that's just——that's just rude.

03:10.482 --> 03:13.440
Pick Peck. Pick Peck.

03:13.485 --> 03:15.441
Well, I'm not choosing Peck.

03:15.487 --> 03:17.068
I mean, she'd stick out in any crowd.

03:17.114 --> 03:18.354
So I guess I'm gonna go with——

03:18.407 --> 03:21.490
eesh——McNally, Nash——

03:21.535 --> 03:23.526
I don't know. Epstein?

03:23.578 --> 03:26.741
Epstein? I think Diaz
might be a better bet.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.075
Ohh.

03:29.543 --> 03:32.376
— Yeah, I'm gonna stick with Epstein.
— Epstein. Yeah.

03:32.421 --> 03:34.377
Okay. Last but not least,

03:34.423 --> 03:36.334
I want to let you know that, uh,

03:36.383 --> 03:39.216
some of the rookies will be
sitting out of rotation today.

03:39.261 --> 03:41.468
Detective Donovan Boyd
is sending three of them out

03:41.513 --> 03:44.630
on the infamous scavenger hunt,
so wish 'em luck.

03:44.683 --> 03:48.471
McNally, Nash, Epstein.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.476
Stay behind with Boyd. He'll brief you.

03:50.522 --> 03:52.262
Peck, Diaz, you two are riding together.

03:52.315 --> 03:54.647
Everybody, let's go. Come on.

03:54.693 --> 03:56.399
(overlapping conversations, indistinct)

03:56.862 --> 03:59.569
You'll be dropped off in nowheresville.
Plainclothes.

03:59.614 --> 04:02.071
No money. No wallet.
No phones. No guns.

04:02.117 --> 04:04.654
Goal is simple: Pick a character,

04:04.703 --> 04:06.944
and whatever you do, commit to it.

04:06.997 --> 04:09.659
Uh, h—how do we know
who we should be?

04:09.708 --> 04:12.370
Be yourself,
or be the opposite of yourself.

04:12.419 --> 04:15.877
I don't care. Use what you know.
Know what you don't know.

04:15.922 --> 04:17.423
— That clear it up for you?
— No.

04:17.466 --> 04:20.503
Be back here 6 AM. in uniform

04:20.552 --> 04:23.214
with as much accumulated money
and drugs as possible.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.218
— (chuckles) Wh...
— I will judge the drugs

04:24.264 --> 04:26.004
by street value, not by volume.

04:26.057 --> 04:27.593
Okay. Wait, wait. No, no, no.
How do we do that?

04:27.642 --> 04:29.257
— How do we figure out——
— Come on, rookies.

04:29.311 --> 04:31.222
You are sophomores now.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.853
You know how to spot a dealer.
You know where they sell it.

04:33.899 --> 04:38.108
Now it is your job to go
and learn how to buy it, so go.

04:38.153 --> 04:41.316
And, hey, you know,
look, be safe out there.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.150
It's not a competition.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.779
All right.
$20 says McNally takes it.

04:46.828 --> 04:50.412
20? Uh, let's make it 60,
because Nash is taking it.

04:50.457 --> 04:52.163
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Noelle's right.

04:52.209 --> 04:53.915
McNally's got this thing
locked (high—pitched voice) up.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.167
Yeah? You want to put your money
where your mouth is, Homicide?

04:56.213 --> 04:57.419
Uh...yeah, no.

04:57.464 --> 04:59.329
Oh, ye of little faith.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.293
Hey, what's the line on Epstein?

05:01.343 --> 05:02.674
— Epstein?
— You betting on us?

05:02.719 --> 05:04.380
Uh, no, not on you. No.

05:04.429 --> 05:05.635
Nobody thinks you stand a chance.

05:05.680 --> 05:06.840
— Thanks a lot.
— (chuckles)

05:06.890 --> 05:08.130
Uh, no problem.
Don't mention it.

05:09.851 --> 05:11.512
This sucks.

05:11.561 --> 05:13.938
I should be undercover, 'cause I blend,

05:13.980 --> 05:16.357
and you——you're a born natch.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.264
You have to admit it's totally ridic.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.730
Would you stop cutting
your words off halfway, okay?

05:20.779 --> 05:22.360
It's new. I don't——
I don't like it.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.862
Although there is something
really brill about this sitch.

05:24.908 --> 05:26.193
Stop it.

05:26.243 --> 05:29.781
We get to spend
the whole shift together,

05:29.830 --> 05:32.287
and we're meant to talk, Chris.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.698
Don't make me get all mushy.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.750
We were good together.

05:37.796 --> 05:40.663
Not really.
I mean, think about it.

05:40.715 --> 05:41.875
We weren't normal.

05:41.925 --> 05:43.165
Yeah, but what is even normal?

05:43.218 --> 05:44.424
In a normal couple,

05:44.469 --> 05:46.334
you have a mama bear
and a papa bear.

05:46.388 --> 05:48.049
You're more like Goldilocks.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.383
Yeah, she's the only human in the story,

05:49.432 --> 05:50.968
so I'm gonna take this as a good sign.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.928
Yeah, worming your way in
where you aren't invited,

05:52.978 --> 05:54.889
trying out different beds
to see which one fits.

05:54.938 --> 05:56.144
Chris, I didn't try out different beds.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.019
Yeah, well,
in the metaphor, you did.

05:57.065 --> 05:58.430
(dispatcher on radio)
We've got reports of a disturbance

05:58.483 --> 05:59.563
in Mount Pleasant Cemetery.

05:59.609 --> 06:01.861
Caller said she heard yelling
and saw three male suspects

06:01.903 --> 06:03.768
chasing a fourth through the cemetery.

06:03.822 --> 06:06.404
Mark 1505 responding.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.485
(siren wails)

06:10.537 --> 06:13.324
Aw. Look how sweet.

06:13.373 --> 06:16.957
This must be where mama bear
and papa bear are buried.

06:17.002 --> 06:17.991
Look.

06:22.007 --> 06:23.122
(Chris) Holy...

06:23.174 --> 06:25.085
(Gail) Hey, are you okay?

06:25.135 --> 06:27.717
Great. Never been better.

06:31.516 --> 06:35.100
Okay. Come on. Come on.
Just put your hands down.

06:35.145 --> 06:36.305
What about your coat?

06:36.354 --> 06:38.219
You're freezing.
Here. Take mine.

06:38.273 --> 06:40.935
What happened to you, man?
Who did this to you?

06:40.984 --> 06:42.440
No idea.

06:45.655 --> 06:49.147
(Boyd) Your wallets, phones.
Rap/do. Rap/do.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.942
One——One, two, three.
One, two, three. Great.

06:53.496 --> 06:55.828
Nothing but the clothes on your back.

06:55.874 --> 06:57.330
Nice.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.081
Now before you go forth,
young soldiers,

06:59.127 --> 07:00.913
hold out your hands.

07:00.962 --> 07:04.045
Have a present for you.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.877
One, two, three.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.794
Bus token. Just in case.

07:09.846 --> 07:11.086
Just in case what?

07:11.139 --> 07:13.380
In case you need a bus token.

07:13.433 --> 07:16.140
Come on, people.
Don't let me down here.

07:16.186 --> 07:18.472
You cannot let them
see you scared out there.

07:18.521 --> 07:19.806
If you're nervous, get closer,

07:19.856 --> 07:22.814
and they won't see you shake, okay?

07:22.859 --> 07:25.225
Have a little faith in yourselves, guys.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.649
(sighs)

07:34.329 --> 07:36.069
(tires skid)

07:38.959 --> 07:40.824
Ha.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.413
It's a start.

07:51.429 --> 07:52.839
How much you get for these again?

07:52.889 --> 07:54.345
10 cents.

07:54.391 --> 07:55.756
10 cents? That's it?

07:55.809 --> 07:58.221
Yeah, but if you get 100, that's 10 bucks.

07:58.269 --> 08:00.100
— See ya, guys.
— Where you going?

08:00.146 --> 08:01.807
Hey, buddy dropped us
in the middle of nowhere

08:01.856 --> 08:03.938
with nothing but a bus token.

08:03.984 --> 08:05.565
Doesn't take a brain surgeon

08:05.610 --> 08:07.817
to realize we're supposed
to take the bus downtown.

08:07.862 --> 08:09.318
Maybe it's for emergencies.

08:09.364 --> 08:12.151
He said use what we know, so...

08:12.200 --> 08:13.565
I'm using what I know.

08:15.662 --> 08:18.699
— Okay.
— All right.

08:18.748 --> 08:21.455
Hey. Hey, wait, wait,
wait, wait. Stop. Hi.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.332
Uh, Trace, follow my lead.

08:23.378 --> 08:26.586
Hi. Hi. Sorry.
Um, my name's Candice.

08:26.631 --> 08:28.838
I'm in town for a conference——

08:28.883 --> 08:31.465
(chuckles) A silly conference,
really, on ovenNriting——

08:31.511 --> 08:34.253
insurance ovenNriting,
new avenues.

08:34.305 --> 08:38.264
Anyway, um, we were actually
on a shuttle to the airport,

08:38.309 --> 08:41.472
and, well, she had to pee,

08:41.521 --> 08:43.603
so we got off at the last hotel stop,

08:43.648 --> 08:45.149
and l stupidly followed her,

08:45.191 --> 08:47.273
and then when we came back out,
the shuttle was gone.

08:47.318 --> 08:49.024
— That's terrible.
— I know. I know.

08:49.070 --> 08:51.447
All of our bags, purses,
everything is gone.

08:51.489 --> 08:53.320
I mean, it's a nightmare.
I am living a nightmare right now.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.027
Is there any way
we could get a ride?

08:55.076 --> 08:56.691
Sorry. I'm already late.

08:56.745 --> 08:58.576
Okay, but maybe just as far
as you're going, you know.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.327
— We could squeeze in.
— Look...

09:00.373 --> 09:02.614
just grab a cab.

09:02.667 --> 09:05.704
Whoa. Thank you so much.
That's really generous.

09:05.754 --> 09:07.870
— Okay. Take care.
— Good luck.

09:09.966 --> 09:12.457
20 bucks.
That's, like, 200 of your bottles.

09:12.510 --> 09:15.627
Yeah, and you're also Candice
the insurance ovenNriter.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.843
OvenNriter. OvenNriter.
UndenNriter?

09:18.892 --> 09:21.099
lt's insurance undenNriter, isn't it?

09:21.144 --> 09:23.510
Pick your character and commit.

09:27.525 --> 09:29.481
Is there another number
we can reach your mother at?

09:29.527 --> 09:31.643
(sighs) She's probably
at her boyfriend's.

09:31.696 --> 09:33.277
Okay, so what's his number?

09:33.323 --> 09:36.440
He doesn't have a phone.
Can I wash my face now?

09:36.493 --> 09:39.280
(sighs) All right. Well, we left
a message at your mom's house.

09:39.329 --> 09:42.071
— Does she check messages?
— Nope.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.705
Well, how are we supposed
to get ahold of her then?

09:44.751 --> 09:47.117
If you find out, let me know.

09:48.797 --> 09:50.628
All right.
Well, in the meantime...

09:50.673 --> 09:51.833
(papers rustling)

09:51.883 --> 09:53.919
Can you tell me exactly what happened?

09:53.968 --> 09:57.586
Look, I told you.
They were robbers, bandits.

09:57.639 --> 10:00.381
Whatever. I just——| want to get my coat,
and I want to go home.

10:00.433 --> 10:01.673
It's okay. You know what, pal?

10:01.726 --> 10:03.808
(coughs)
You don't have to say a thing.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.344
(beeps, shutter clicks)

10:06.397 --> 10:07.773
So you're a "liar."

10:07.816 --> 10:09.101
— Did you get that?
— Yep.

10:09.150 --> 10:12.313
Hey. Now what else we got here?

10:12.362 --> 10:14.068
"Dip stick." That's original.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.279
Turn to the left.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.314
You know a girl named Sarah?

10:19.994 --> 10:21.404
Sarah wasn't there.

10:21.454 --> 10:22.443
Actually you're probably right.

10:22.497 --> 10:23.737
"Touch Sarah and die."

10:23.790 --> 10:26.998
That's probably Sarah's brother
or Sarah's boyfriend, maybe?

10:28.628 --> 10:30.664
Can I, uh, talk to you guys?

10:32.841 --> 10:34.001
(Oliver) Yeah.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.589
So I found him
on a social networking site.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.129
Someone just posted
a hate page about him.

10:41.182 --> 10:43.559
The administrators are two teenagers
from his high school,

10:43.601 --> 10:45.387
Cooper Wells and Sarah Jones.

10:45.436 --> 10:46.562
Okay. Good work.

10:47.772 --> 10:48.852
(clicks tongue)

10:48.898 --> 10:51.014
Haul 'em in here.

10:51.067 --> 10:54.776
(The Arka Teks) J‘ I walk with a swagger
and a bad attitude J‘

10:54.821 --> 10:58.689
J‘ I'm looking like a rock star
from my head to my shoes J‘

10:58.741 --> 11:00.606
J‘ This place is 'bout to lose it J‘

11:00.660 --> 11:04.744
J‘ Don't know what to do,
'cause |——l——l——l J‘

11:21.973 --> 11:23.713
— J‘ on the phone J‘
— (man) Oh, my lord.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.631
— J‘ But you don't want to go J‘
— You good, man?

11:25.685 --> 11:28.973
— Yeah.
— J‘ I know you know I got it J‘

11:29.022 --> 11:30.432
J‘ Next thing that they'll see J‘

11:30.481 --> 11:32.563

11:34.652 --> 11:37.109
J‘ I know you know I got it J‘

11:37.155 --> 11:40.192
Hi. I'd like to report a fight
that just broke out at Prohibition.

11:40.241 --> 11:42.618
It's a bar, Queen and Broadview.
It's getting very serious.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.366
You want to send some people down.
Thank you.

11:44.412 --> 11:45.868
J‘ Nobody else that can do it better J‘

11:45.914 --> 11:47.870
J‘ I know, I know I got it J‘

11:47.916 --> 11:49.656
(truck horn blares)

11:49.709 --> 11:52.291
(Andy) I guess we should both be
in insurance.

11:52.337 --> 11:56.000
Pfft. Insurance girls
from snoresville? Uh—uh.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.664
What? It's an inconspicuous
character.

11:57.717 --> 12:00.083
Candice...Sloaney.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.092
— (laughs)
— Young and eager,

12:02.138 --> 12:04.925
really wants to climb that
competitive insurance ladder.

12:04.974 --> 12:06.430
You can be Doreen.

12:06.476 --> 12:08.808
I'm gonna pick my own name,
thank you very much.

12:08.853 --> 12:10.263
Okay, then what's it gonna be?

12:10.313 --> 12:11.928
I mean, you've gotta use
what you've got.

12:11.981 --> 12:13.437
We got nothing!

12:13.483 --> 12:16.270
Th——We have stuff, okay?

12:16.319 --> 12:18.856
We've got our brains,
and we have skills,

12:18.905 --> 12:21.237
so what are you good at?

12:21.282 --> 12:22.692
I don't know.

12:24.619 --> 12:26.610
— Pool.
— Okay.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.528
If there was a pool hall around here,

12:28.581 --> 12:30.287
I could shoot some pool,
make us some bucks.

12:30.333 --> 12:33.120
Wait.
We're by the airport, right?

12:33.169 --> 12:35.376
— Alpine lnn.
— What's that?

12:35.421 --> 12:37.457
It's a motel that I heard
the T.O.s talking about.

12:37.507 --> 12:38.667
Bet you they have a pool table.

12:38.716 --> 12:40.331
Lead the way...

12:42.762 --> 12:44.218
Candice.

12:45.723 --> 12:47.054
Jeremy.

12:47.100 --> 12:48.510
You still hanging around here?

12:50.895 --> 12:52.010
Who are you?

12:52.063 --> 12:55.430
Dov Epstein, Adam's brother.

12:55.483 --> 12:57.144
Kibbles?

12:57.193 --> 12:58.854
Well, they don't call me that
anymore, but...

12:58.903 --> 13:01.519
— okay.
— (laughs) Jeez.

13:01.572 --> 13:03.608
You got big. I haven't seen you
since you were a kid.

13:03.658 --> 13:05.194
I don't hang around here much.

13:05.243 --> 13:06.449
Huh.

13:06.494 --> 13:07.779
So how are you?
How's everything?

13:07.829 --> 13:09.694
You, uh——You married? You...

13:09.747 --> 13:11.999
— (chuckles) You...
— (chuckles) Uh...

13:12.041 --> 13:13.827
No, thank you.

13:16.045 --> 13:17.421
— Well, grab a seat.
— No, no. It's okay.

13:17.463 --> 13:19.715
I gotta run. ljust——
I wanted to say hi, and——

13:19.757 --> 13:20.917
Hey...

13:20.967 --> 13:23.754
are you still...you know?

13:25.430 --> 13:26.795
Come on, man.
My brother and l were tight.

13:26.848 --> 13:28.634
I know you hooked him up.
(chuckles)

13:30.643 --> 13:32.850
All right. Well,
| just wanted to warn you.

13:32.895 --> 13:35.056
The cops were in here
a couple minutes ago.

13:35.106 --> 13:36.471
Where?

13:36.524 --> 13:39.436
You didn't see the guy?
Plainclothes.

13:41.112 --> 13:43.103
Look, it's okay.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.111
All right? It's cool.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.237
I got nothing to worry about.

13:46.617 --> 13:48.778
(police radio chatter)

13:50.872 --> 13:52.612
Right.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.701
(police radio chatter)

14:02.216 --> 14:03.831
Thanks, man.
Appreciate the heads—up.

14:03.885 --> 14:06.217
Jeremy, listen...

14:06.262 --> 14:08.218
I'm not gonna lie.
I came here looking for you.

14:08.264 --> 14:13.600
Truth is, I got nothing——
no phone, no money, not a dime.

14:13.644 --> 14:15.896
— I need to score.
— You need to score?

14:15.938 --> 14:17.474
l was hoping you could front me.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.189
Uaughs)

14:22.904 --> 14:26.317
No. No way. Not a chance.

14:26.366 --> 14:29.199
— Really?
— Mm—hmm.

14:29.243 --> 14:30.449
Okay.

14:32.246 --> 14:33.452
Come on, Kibbles.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.079
Hey.

14:36.834 --> 14:39.541
You going somewhere?
You need a lift?

14:39.587 --> 14:40.997
I'm just running a few errands.

14:41.047 --> 14:42.912
You want to tag along,
that's fine by me.

14:44.509 --> 14:47.296
(chuckles)

14:47.345 --> 14:49.961
(woman) J‘ Bump, bump,
bump that sucker J‘

14:50.014 --> 14:51.390
(man, lowered voice)
Todd, what happens on the road,

14:51.432 --> 14:54.094
— stays on the road. Come on.
— 5 bucks a rack?

14:54.143 --> 14:58.227
5 bucks?
Why don't we make it 20?

14:58.272 --> 15:01.935
20 bucks. I mean,
I've only played pool once in my life.

15:01.984 --> 15:03.269
(lowered voice) You're not
supposed to tell them that.

15:03.319 --> 15:04.559
Yep.

15:04.612 --> 15:07.149
(normal voice)
20 is fine. Let's do 20.

15:07.198 --> 15:10.315
Great. So you here
with the conference?

15:10.368 --> 15:13.986
Yep. Yeah. Well, a different one
than you, obviously.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.949
— I'm in insurance.
— Oh.

15:15.998 --> 15:17.579
Yeah, we're actually leaving
on a flight tomorrow morning

15:17.625 --> 15:19.957
at 6 AM. back to Wisconsin.
Right, Doreen?

15:21.170 --> 15:22.205
Doreen?

15:23.589 --> 15:25.921
Well, Candice is here
for the insurance conference.

15:25.967 --> 15:27.332
| just tagged along. (chuckles)

15:27.385 --> 15:28.841
We're childhood friends,

15:28.886 --> 15:30.842
and I think herjob's
a little boring, actually.

15:30.888 --> 15:32.264
— (chuckles)
— Oh, really?

15:32.306 --> 15:34.922
Yeah, 'cause yours is just so exciting.

15:34.976 --> 15:36.716
What is it you do?

15:37.770 --> 15:40.728
l'm...a...stripper.

15:42.066 --> 15:44.899
Wow. Really?

15:44.944 --> 15:46.809
(chuckles)

15:46.863 --> 15:48.728
I've never met a stripper before...

15:48.781 --> 15:51.022
— (laughs)
— Except in strip clubs.

15:51.075 --> 15:52.986
Well, it'sjust a job,
like any other.

15:53.035 --> 15:56.573
J‘ It's such a tiny line
between love and J‘

15:56.622 --> 15:57.907
J‘ Boy, baby boy... J‘

15:57.957 --> 15:59.913
Insurance is really kinda fascinating.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.915
Almost as fun
as Tag—Team Tuesdays.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.917
J‘ ...enjoy this goodbye kiss J‘

16:03.963 --> 16:07.330
J‘ Just walk in that door,
and you kissing the floor J‘

16:07.383 --> 16:08.418
— Whoo!
— J‘ And you won't J‘

16:08.468 --> 16:10.504
J‘ Laugh no more, yeah J‘

16:12.138 --> 16:14.595
— J‘ Bump that sucker J‘
— Hey!

16:14.640 --> 16:17.131
(Andy and Traci laugh)

16:17.185 --> 16:18.846
Ha ha.

16:18.895 --> 16:21.261
— Uh, kiss me.
— What?

16:21.314 --> 16:23.555
Just kiss me. Come on. Look.

16:23.608 --> 16:27.351
J‘ Bump that sucker,
make yourself a queen J‘

16:27.403 --> 16:29.940
(both laugh)

16:29.989 --> 16:31.729
(door buzzes)

16:35.620 --> 16:37.156
Oh, great.

16:37.205 --> 16:38.615
Why are they here?

16:38.664 --> 16:40.040
We just had to ask 'em
a few questions.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.993
Oh, God. Just shoot me.

16:43.294 --> 16:44.534
He's gotta be a bad seed.

16:44.587 --> 16:47.078
He is. He's annoying.

16:47.131 --> 16:50.419
He, like, stares at me all the time.
He's aggravating.

16:50.468 --> 16:53.255
Ooh, I bet. How awful.

16:53.304 --> 16:54.544
And that's reason enough to tie him up

16:54.597 --> 16:56.133
and leave him to freeze to death?

16:56.182 --> 16:58.548
The guy's psycho.
Don't believe a word he says.

16:58.601 --> 17:00.637
No, he hasn't said anything...yet.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.314
Yep. (sighs)

17:07.360 --> 17:09.191
(door release buzzes, beeps)

17:13.199 --> 17:15.064
I take it you know these kids.

17:15.117 --> 17:16.368
A bit.

17:16.410 --> 17:17.991
And they're responsible for the, uh...

17:20.456 --> 17:23.619
Just please——
Just let them go home.

17:23.668 --> 17:26.330
Wow. You're being really nice.

17:26.963 --> 17:28.999
(Oliver) They must be your friends.

17:29.048 --> 17:31.414
Yes. They're my friends.

17:32.343 --> 17:34.334
All right. Well, in that case,
come with me.

17:35.429 --> 17:36.418
Come on.

17:42.478 --> 17:44.890
Oh, poor kid.

17:44.939 --> 17:46.725
| always feel bad for the nerds.

17:46.774 --> 17:49.481
Nice. Cold and condescending.

17:49.527 --> 17:52.109
Why am I not surprised?

17:52.154 --> 17:53.109
(door opens)

17:53.155 --> 17:54.941
Officer Diaz.

17:54.991 --> 17:58.074
Sarah and Cooper's mom and dad
agreed to this little sit—down

17:58.119 --> 18:00.110
so we could figure out
who tied up our boy here.

18:00.162 --> 18:02.244
Sarah saw him staring
into her bedroom window.

18:02.290 --> 18:04.406
(Sarah) I was so creeped out.

18:04.458 --> 18:06.585
Then he stole a bracelet off
of our teacher's desk

18:06.627 --> 18:09.494
and put it in my locker.
I almost got expelled.

18:09.547 --> 18:11.754
I wasn't trying to get you in trouble.

18:11.799 --> 18:13.881
| just wanted to give you something.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.417
So this was payback?

18:17.888 --> 18:20.095
(sighs) Look, I told you,

18:20.141 --> 18:22.757
it wasn't them.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.641
l have no idea who it was.

18:27.356 --> 18:29.267
I think we have enough
for a little buy.

18:29.317 --> 18:31.103
I don't want to do little.
I want to do big.

18:31.152 --> 18:33.234
Let's keep going.

18:33.279 --> 18:34.439
Table open?

18:34.488 --> 18:35.648
Yeah. 20 bucks a rack.

18:35.698 --> 18:38.565
Come on. You can do better than that.

18:38.618 --> 18:40.904
Depends. Who's your partner?

18:40.953 --> 18:43.820
Him. Hey, J.D.,
you ready to play?

18:48.502 --> 18:51.915
(woman) J‘ I don't care
if you don't care J‘

19:04.310 --> 19:06.175
So what brings you two here?

19:06.228 --> 19:07.764
We're just here
for a couple of nights.

19:07.813 --> 19:10.270
We're actually leaving tomorrow
on a 6 AM. flight.

19:10.316 --> 19:12.398
— That's too bad.
— It's okay.

19:12.443 --> 19:14.274
What sucks is that
I lost all my luggage.

19:14.320 --> 19:17.062
Now I got nothing left
except for a bus token.

19:17.114 --> 19:18.490
Been there. You'll make it.

19:24.955 --> 19:27.788
(sighs)
Jamie. Jamie Brennan.

19:27.833 --> 19:29.994
That's, uh, J.D.

19:30.044 --> 19:31.909
He started working for me
a couple weeks ago.

19:31.962 --> 19:34.419
Okay. I'm Candice,
and, uh, this is Doreen.

19:34.465 --> 19:36.205
Hi.

19:36.258 --> 19:38.795
Okay, Candice.

19:38.844 --> 19:40.835
Only the eight ball left.
Don't choke.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.094
Okay.

19:46.435 --> 19:47.845
(Jamie chuckles)

19:47.895 --> 19:49.806
Sorry.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.106
All yours. Take it away.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.481
No mercy.

20:00.074 --> 20:02.360
— Boom.
— Pay up, ladies.

20:02.410 --> 20:04.822
No, no, no. Not yet.
Let's go double or nothing.

20:04.870 --> 20:06.201
Uh, you know what? No.

20:06.247 --> 20:07.487
I gotta get up early tomorrow,
so I'm out.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.326
That's good,
because, sweetheart,

20:09.375 --> 20:11.616
I hate to tell ya, but you're
dragging your partner down here.

20:11.669 --> 20:14.285
Doreen, you want to go straight up?
Double or nothing.

20:14.338 --> 20:15.498
Um...

20:15.548 --> 20:16.663
Good.

20:20.594 --> 20:21.549
(balls clatter)

20:21.595 --> 20:23.176
Nice car.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.632
Yeah, she's sweet.

20:24.682 --> 20:26.092
Must be doing all right for yourself.

20:26.142 --> 20:27.348
Not bad.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.809
What about you?

20:30.855 --> 20:32.641
— You didn't become a lawyer?
— Nope.

20:32.690 --> 20:36.933
Adam was sure you were gonna
become a lawyer. (laughs)

20:36.986 --> 20:39.773
Ah, Adam. Man.

20:39.822 --> 20:41.562
Oh, that guy.

20:42.867 --> 20:44.482
He knew how to party.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.781
I don't get it.

20:49.874 --> 20:51.080
He always...

20:52.710 --> 20:54.246
seemed so happy.

20:56.839 --> 20:58.670
I don't get why he...

20:58.716 --> 21:00.126
he killed himself.

21:00.176 --> 21:03.384
(siren wailing)

21:03.429 --> 21:05.135
Neither do we.

21:13.147 --> 21:14.387
I'll wait here?

21:15.441 --> 21:17.181
No. Come with me.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.028
(alarm chirps, locks click)

21:27.077 --> 21:28.533
Wait here.
I'll be a few minutes.

21:28.579 --> 21:31.036
— (chuckles) Why?
— Because I said so.

21:31.081 --> 21:32.867
lt's freezing. You're gonna
make me wait outside?

21:32.917 --> 21:34.327
Yep.

21:41.675 --> 21:45.964
(door handles rattle)

21:50.601 --> 21:52.933
Rubbing alcohol should
get that off your face.

21:52.978 --> 21:55.264
Great.
Maybe mom's vodka will work.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.303
You know what?

21:56.357 --> 21:58.439
You think you're the only one
with a messed—up mother?

21:58.484 --> 22:00.566
I mean, you're just gonna have to learn
to look after yourself.

22:00.611 --> 22:02.192
I can look after myself.

22:02.238 --> 22:03.819
No one else
is gonna wash my face.

22:03.864 --> 22:05.445
That's not what I mean, okay?

22:05.491 --> 22:08.483
I'm saying, come on, grow a pair.

22:08.536 --> 22:10.697
Fight back for once in your life,

22:10.746 --> 22:12.702
'cause if you let them
walk away from this,

22:12.748 --> 22:15.706
they're gonna keep doing it
over and over and over again.

22:17.086 --> 22:18.667
Just give me my coat.

22:22.967 --> 22:24.173
(sighs)

22:28.264 --> 22:30.129
What brings you to town?

22:30.182 --> 22:31.262
— Conference.
— Mm—hmm.

22:31.308 --> 22:33.014
A conference? What kind?

22:33.060 --> 22:34.095
Insurance.

22:34.144 --> 22:36.726
Insurance? Oh. How's that been?

22:36.772 --> 22:38.273
Great. Terrific.

22:38.315 --> 22:39.430
Mm—hmm.

22:39.483 --> 22:40.814
A little lonely.

22:40.860 --> 22:42.521
What about you?

22:42.570 --> 22:45.903
Oh, new job, fresh start.

22:47.366 --> 22:48.606
Actually I've been wondering

22:48.659 --> 22:50.650
why I got into this business
in the first place.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.785
What business is that?

22:52.830 --> 22:55.663
Oh, nothing as interesting
as insurance, that's for sure.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.744
(chuckles) Nothing is.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.336
So, um...

23:06.385 --> 23:07.886
we were just hoping to...

23:07.928 --> 23:10.510
figure out a little somethin',

23:10.556 --> 23:12.672
get us through the night.

23:12.725 --> 23:15.182
It's gonna be a long one,
so, you know,

23:15.227 --> 23:16.933
might as well enjoy it.

23:16.979 --> 23:20.016
You might want to talk
to Donnie in room four.

23:20.065 --> 23:22.807
He's a crazy son of a bitch,
but you can tell him I sent you.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.195
Okay. We gotta go.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.947
Yeah. You gotta find a place
to put your head down

23:30.993 --> 23:32.858
for the rest of the night.
Not here.

23:32.912 --> 23:35.449
Look at that. Whoo!

23:38.834 --> 23:41.075
She smoked me.
Okay, come on. One more.

23:41.128 --> 23:43.619
No. We gotta get outta here.
Uh, it was nice to meet you.

23:43.672 --> 23:45.287
— You, too.
— J.D., nice to meet you.

23:45.341 --> 23:46.797
Maybe we'll see you
around sometime.

23:46.842 --> 23:48.048
Yeah, you never know.

23:48.093 --> 23:49.378
Uh, see ya.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.543
Bye.

23:56.310 --> 23:58.141
We are seriously badass.
Uaughs)

23:58.187 --> 24:00.473
You are a serious liar.
You heard about this place

24:00.522 --> 24:02.137
— through Swarek, didn't you?
— No.

24:02.191 --> 24:04.273
Do you know how lucky we are
we got away with that?

24:04.318 --> 24:07.060
It's not luck. We used what we knew,
and we committed.

24:07.112 --> 24:08.272
Who is this guy?

24:08.322 --> 24:10.028
(sighs) I don't know. Room four.

24:10.074 --> 24:11.359
Said his name was Donnie.

24:14.411 --> 24:17.153
Hi. Are you Donnie?

24:17.206 --> 24:18.321
Who are you?

24:18.374 --> 24:20.456
l'm Candice,
and this is Doreen.

24:20.501 --> 24:22.207
So why ya knockin' on my door?

24:22.252 --> 24:25.915
Uh, well, we were talking to
Jamie Brennan down in the bar,

24:25.965 --> 24:27.205
and he said you would help us.

24:28.258 --> 24:29.714
Oh, Brennan sent ya.

24:31.136 --> 24:33.047
All right. Come in.

24:34.098 --> 24:35.383
Come in.

24:36.850 --> 24:38.977
Hope you came to party.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.523
You know the band Anvil?

24:47.611 --> 24:48.942
Yeah, a little.

24:48.988 --> 24:51.445
Sit. I got a bootleg copy

24:51.490 --> 24:53.355
of their never—released album.

24:53.409 --> 24:55.115
Rocks me hard.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.321
Uh, yeah, we actually
don't have a lot of time.

24:59.456 --> 25:01.447
Well, listen up, Minnie Mouse.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.081
You came knocking on my door

25:03.127 --> 25:04.992
while I was watching "Fresh Prince,"

25:05.045 --> 25:06.876
in the middle of my dessert.

25:06.922 --> 25:10.665
You didn't care about my plans.
Why should I care about yours?

25:10.718 --> 25:12.333
Sit down.

25:12.386 --> 25:13.421
(Andy) Okay.

25:16.056 --> 25:20.049
(man shouting, baby crying
in distance)

25:21.770 --> 25:22.930
(Donnie scoffs) So...

25:22.980 --> 25:24.311
(Anvil's "Metal on Metal" playing)

25:24.356 --> 25:28.725
you guys are what?
Uh, secretaries? Waitresses?

25:28.777 --> 25:31.234
Uh, I'm in insurance.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.738
Oh, classy.
You both work insurance?

25:34.783 --> 25:36.068
No, I'm a dancer.

25:36.118 --> 25:39.485
A real dancer?
Like a "take off your clothes

25:39.538 --> 25:41.369
and wave it in my face"
kind of dancer?

25:41.415 --> 25:45.749
(chuckles)
Yeah, that kind of dancer.

25:45.794 --> 25:49.252
A stripper and an insurance bitch
looking to get high——

25:49.298 --> 25:50.504
quel/e surprise.

25:50.549 --> 25:51.914
Do you mind
if I use your bathroom?

25:51.967 --> 25:55.300
Oh, Stacy or whatever her name,

25:55.345 --> 25:56.846
some party girl from the bar,

25:56.889 --> 25:58.095
she's still in there.

25:58.140 --> 26:00.677
Why don't you show me
what you got?

26:00.726 --> 26:01.806
What do you mean?

26:01.852 --> 26:04.184
I don't mean your ta—tas, honey.
Don't worry.

26:05.105 --> 26:06.311
Show me the cash.

26:11.153 --> 26:16.443
J‘ Metal on metal,
shakin' the place... J‘

26:16.492 --> 26:18.357
Why don't I play you
one of their live albums?

26:19.870 --> 26:21.735
Look, are you sure she's okay?

26:21.789 --> 26:24.075
Yeah. She probably just nodded off.

26:24.124 --> 26:25.739
Oh, okay.
Then can I go in there anyway?

26:25.793 --> 26:27.658
I don't mind if you don't.

26:27.711 --> 26:29.667
Hasn't been serviced in a while.

26:29.713 --> 26:30.668
(chuckles)

26:30.714 --> 26:32.750
(both chuckle)

26:32.800 --> 26:34.916
I met the guys from Anvil.

26:34.968 --> 26:37.050
l was buddies with their drummer.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.961
Partied on their bus, man,

26:39.014 --> 26:41.596
one night after they opened
for Motdrhead.

26:41.642 --> 26:43.758
They opened for Motdrhead.
Did you know that?

26:43.811 --> 26:45.096
— No.
— Yeah.

26:45.145 --> 26:46.806
We got to get her help now.

26:46.855 --> 26:48.561
Her pulse is weak.
She's barely breathing.

26:48.607 --> 26:50.768
What did she take?

26:50.818 --> 26:52.774
(sighs) Let me see.

26:52.820 --> 26:54.902
She wanted a speedball.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.687
What did you do?

26:58.617 --> 27:01.450
Ohh, stupid bitch.

27:01.495 --> 27:03.611
She did the whole thing.

27:03.664 --> 27:04.995
Okay, well, we need
to call an ambulance.

27:05.040 --> 27:06.155
We gotta get her out of here.

27:06.208 --> 27:09.166
No, no, no, you sit down.
Sit down!

27:09.211 --> 27:10.667
(clatter,
telephone bell dings)

27:10.712 --> 27:12.498
Nobody's calling anybody.

27:15.759 --> 27:17.750
(car alarm chirps)

27:17.803 --> 27:19.964
That was more than
a couple of minutes.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.563
Just let us call an ambulance.

27:35.612 --> 27:37.273
No, you're not calling an ambulance.

27:37.322 --> 27:39.278
They'll call the cops.
Obviously I don't like cops.

27:39.324 --> 27:41.030
Okay, so you're just
gonna let her die?

27:41.076 --> 27:43.818
It's not my fault she's too stupid
to know her limit.

27:43.871 --> 27:45.953
It's a lot easier
to get rid of a dead body

27:45.998 --> 27:47.363
than deal with the cops.

27:47.416 --> 27:50.078
— Can I check on her?
— Yeah.

27:51.545 --> 27:53.251
Come on. Let us just
get her out of here, okay?

27:53.297 --> 27:55.128
We'll leave you out of it.
Trust me.

27:55.174 --> 27:57.039
We are not interested
in bringing in the cops.

27:57.092 --> 27:59.003
(Donnie) Aw, man.
I can't believe this.

27:59.052 --> 28:00.553
So you don't know this girl?

28:00.596 --> 28:02.552
I never met her before in my life.

28:02.598 --> 28:04.589
I met her down in the bar earlier.

28:04.641 --> 28:06.347
Well, you may not know her,
but I do,

28:06.393 --> 28:08.475
— and you gotta let us take her.
— What a load.

28:08.520 --> 28:11.057
Donnie, l dance with that girl.
I know her.

28:11.106 --> 28:13.722
Her boyfriend's a biker,
big guy named Max,

28:13.775 --> 28:16.733
not one of the nice ones,
and if he finds out that she was here,

28:16.778 --> 28:19.440
if he finds out that
she died on your watch...

28:24.828 --> 28:26.864
Oh, man. Get her outta here.

28:26.914 --> 28:29.200
She's your problem now. Go!

28:29.249 --> 28:30.659
Okay.

28:30.709 --> 28:31.698
Prop her head. Prop her head.

28:31.752 --> 28:33.663
Just hold her head, okay?

28:33.712 --> 28:35.122
Chair.

28:35.172 --> 28:36.332
Let's turn it around.

28:36.381 --> 28:38.667
Yeah. Okay. One, two——
(grunts)

28:38.717 --> 28:39.672
— Okay, got her.
— Got her?

28:39.718 --> 28:42.050
Yeah. Okay, just——(grunts)

28:42.095 --> 28:44.086
Make sure you get the ambulance
to come to the front.

28:45.599 --> 28:49.012
Hey. Friend just had
a little too much to drink.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.801
(rock music playing)

28:50.854 --> 28:52.765
I've always felt bad.
You know that.

28:55.817 --> 28:58.524
Adam and l were...

28:58.570 --> 29:02.279
what, 13, first time
I stole pills from my mom.

29:04.618 --> 29:06.233
Minute he took 'em, I...

29:06.286 --> 29:08.618
(man) J‘ Stop spinnin' the wheel... J‘

29:08.664 --> 29:10.154
I don't know.
He couldn't get enough.

29:10.207 --> 29:12.698
Adam had problems.

29:12.751 --> 29:14.662
Drugs were his way of trying to fix 'em.

29:16.505 --> 29:17.995
It didn't work.

29:28.475 --> 29:29.806
You gonna be long?

29:29.851 --> 29:31.591
Shouldn't be.

29:31.645 --> 29:33.010
Why don't you just...

29:33.063 --> 29:34.269
stay in the car, all right?

29:34.314 --> 29:35.554
You sure?

29:36.984 --> 29:37.973
We're good.

29:47.953 --> 29:49.363
(door buzzer)

29:49.413 --> 29:50.869
(door release buzzes)

29:53.083 --> 29:54.072
(door closes)

30:24.990 --> 30:27.902
Yeah. Hey, thanks.
Hey, what's up?

30:27.951 --> 30:29.816
Are you Chris Diaz, the rock star?

30:29.870 --> 30:31.235
What do you mean?

30:31.288 --> 30:32.824
Yeah.

30:32.873 --> 30:35.785
The cool cop who gives
slick advice to bullied kids.

30:35.834 --> 30:38.871
— Yeah. Fight back, eye for an eye.
— What are you talking about?

30:38.920 --> 30:40.535
| just picked up your friend
Finton Tucker,

30:40.589 --> 30:42.796
the boy from the, uh——
from the graveyard.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.797
He tracked down his bully

30:44.843 --> 30:46.458
and smashed a brick into his face.

30:46.511 --> 30:47.762
— What?
— A brick.

30:47.804 --> 30:49.840
That Cooper kid,
he's in the hospital with serious injuries.

30:49.890 --> 30:51.596
That's some great advice, man.

30:51.641 --> 30:54.223
| just wanted Finton to press charges.
That's all I meant.

30:54.269 --> 30:56.976
You laid it on thick for that kid

30:57.022 --> 30:59.809
because it made you feel like a man
who could stand up for himself,

30:59.858 --> 31:02.850
when really,
you're just as scared as he is.

31:02.903 --> 31:05.269
It's a rookie move, man.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.074
What'll happen to Finton?

31:08.116 --> 31:09.652
You start a criminal record
for a kid like that,

31:09.701 --> 31:11.237
you might as well say goodbye.

31:13.038 --> 31:14.494
Gotta make this right, buddy.

31:18.460 --> 31:20.166
(Traci) We did good.

31:20.212 --> 31:21.292
She's gonna be okay.

31:21.338 --> 31:22.623
Yeah, I hope so.

31:24.466 --> 31:25.797
You coming?

31:25.842 --> 31:27.343
I'll meet you back at the station.

31:28.970 --> 31:30.801
McNally...

31:30.847 --> 31:33.259
Go directly to jail.
Do not pass go.

31:33.308 --> 31:36.015
Do not linger.
Don't do anything stupid.

31:36.061 --> 31:37.801
J.D., off—limits?

31:37.854 --> 31:38.809
I know.

31:38.855 --> 31:40.641
— Do you hear me?
— Yes.

31:44.486 --> 31:46.022
(Sam clears throat)

31:46.071 --> 31:50.314
Most employers run when they hear
about my previous experience.

31:50.367 --> 31:51.823
Which part?

31:51.868 --> 31:53.608
Folding laundry at Kingston Pen.

31:55.163 --> 31:57.575
Do time there,
you can work anywhere.

31:57.624 --> 31:59.034
I know.

31:59.084 --> 32:00.824
Uh, who was your guy there?

32:00.877 --> 32:02.128
Which guy?

32:03.880 --> 32:05.495
Who you folded laundry for.

32:05.549 --> 32:09.167
Wasn't a guy. It was a big brick house
named Maureen——

32:09.219 --> 32:11.050
only female hack in the joint.

32:13.390 --> 32:15.426
When I was in there,
there was two of 'em.

32:16.810 --> 32:18.300
You kidding me?

32:18.353 --> 32:19.889
You were in there?

32:19.938 --> 32:21.553
Uaughs)

32:21.606 --> 32:23.062
Alice.

32:23.108 --> 32:25.690
300 pounds,
face like a bag of hammers.

32:25.735 --> 32:27.646
Uaughs)

32:27.696 --> 32:29.106
That was a long time ago.

32:32.492 --> 32:35.734
(clears throat)
So yeah. Job okay?

32:35.787 --> 32:37.823
It's good. It's a paycheck.

32:37.873 --> 32:39.579
(clears throat)

32:39.624 --> 32:42.787
Wouldn't mind, uh, figuring a way
to earn a bit more cash

32:42.836 --> 32:44.622
if any extra work comes up.

32:44.671 --> 32:46.002
I mean, I can throw you
some overtime,

32:46.047 --> 32:47.423
if that's what you mean.

32:50.218 --> 32:52.595
Well, look who's back.

32:52.637 --> 32:54.173
Hey.

32:55.140 --> 32:55.970
Hey.

32:56.016 --> 32:59.554
Um, I'm gonna be on a plane
in a couple hours,

32:59.603 --> 33:02.219
back to Appleton, and I'll be gone,
out of your life,

33:02.272 --> 33:04.513
SO...

33:04.566 --> 33:08.855
if you're not doing anything
in the next couple hours, maybe...

33:14.784 --> 33:16.866
l'm——l'm with my boss now.

33:16.912 --> 33:18.493
Right.

33:18.538 --> 33:20.995
And I wouldn't want you
to miss your flight.

33:24.169 --> 33:26.410
Okay.

33:26.463 --> 33:28.249
Then I'm gone.

33:30.967 --> 33:33.379
(scoffs)

33:34.387 --> 33:36.844
(Jamie chuckles, clears throat)

33:36.890 --> 33:38.551
We have business, you and me.

33:39.976 --> 33:41.932
Yes, we do.

33:41.978 --> 33:44.094
We can catch up
on that business tomorrow

33:44.147 --> 33:45.262
or the next day

33:45.315 --> 33:47.226
or day after that...

33:48.235 --> 33:51.819
but a woman like that
doesn't knock on your door every day.

34:16.096 --> 34:17.506
Let's go.

34:23.270 --> 34:25.386
(switch clicks)

34:25.438 --> 34:27.303
So what, you can just
turn the cameras off?

34:27.357 --> 34:28.722
They don't care?

34:28.775 --> 34:31.016
I gotta have some kind of life, right?

34:31.069 --> 34:32.354
lguess.

34:35.115 --> 34:38.607
I'm gonna call you a cab,
it's gonna take you back to the station,

34:38.660 --> 34:40.241
and you're gonna get into your uniform.

34:45.125 --> 34:46.786
No.

34:46.835 --> 34:51.044
(Andy Brown) J‘ And | just want
my heart to fall apart J‘

34:53.633 --> 34:58.002
J‘ Probably should have
told you all along J‘

34:58.054 --> 35:00.136
J‘ My angel J‘

35:00.181 --> 35:01.136
J‘ And I just... J‘

35:01.182 --> 35:02.467
If you don't leave now,

35:02.517 --> 35:03.882
there's no going back.

35:04.477 --> 35:07.014
I don't want to go back.

35:07.063 --> 35:11.648
J‘ And | just want your love
to fade away J‘

35:11.693 --> 35:14.184
J‘ To ashes J‘

35:14.237 --> 35:16.478
J‘ Beautiful J‘

35:18.074 --> 35:21.987
J‘ I should have told you
from the first time J‘

35:22.037 --> 35:27.407
J‘ I saw your eyes J‘

35:27.459 --> 35:31.168
J‘ Beautiful J‘

35:31.212 --> 35:35.080
J‘ I should have told you all along J‘

35:48.146 --> 35:51.980
J‘ I should have told you all along J‘

35:54.861 --> 35:59.446
J‘ I should have told you all along J‘

36:10.001 --> 36:14.665
J‘ And | just want my heart to fall apart J‘

36:14.714 --> 36:16.500
J‘ To ashes J‘

36:16.549 --> 36:21.043
J‘ And | just want this love
to waste away J‘

36:21.096 --> 36:22.961
J‘ To ashes J‘

36:23.014 --> 36:27.599
J‘ And | just want my heart
to tear apart J‘

36:27.644 --> 36:31.432
J‘ To ashes J‘

36:34.484 --> 36:37.021
J‘ To ashes J‘

36:42.826 --> 36:46.114
(Frank) Now this is when | start
to get nervous. (clears throat)

36:46.162 --> 36:48.198
They'll make it back.

36:48.248 --> 36:51.536
They might be empty—handed,
but they always make it back.

36:51.584 --> 36:52.994
Yeah, must be what it's like

36:53.044 --> 36:56.002
to wait for your kids
to come home by curfew.

36:56.047 --> 37:01.542
Yeah. Well, might be the closest
we ever get to knowing that.

37:01.594 --> 37:04.427
Nah, I don't think
it's the closest we'll get.

37:10.353 --> 37:13.390
(Andy) Think the universe has a plan?

37:13.440 --> 37:15.772
Forus?

37:15.817 --> 37:17.682
Oh, yeah.
It was undoubtedly fate

37:17.736 --> 37:19.317
that brought you
into that bar tonight.

37:19.362 --> 37:21.023
— (laughs)
— Mm—hmm.

37:21.072 --> 37:23.313
Okay, I might remember
you saying something about it,

37:23.366 --> 37:24.947
but I didn't know
you were gonna be there.

37:24.993 --> 37:26.574
— Oh, yeah.
— I didn't.

37:26.619 --> 37:30.578
I never thought I'd see
anybody I knew at the Alpine lnn...

37:30.623 --> 37:33.330
— (groans) Oh, my God.
— least of all, you.

37:33.376 --> 37:37.119
My one chance to be
whoever I want to be,

37:37.172 --> 37:40.915
and I choose Candice
who works in insurance.

37:40.967 --> 37:42.332
(sighs) God.

37:42.385 --> 37:43.886
All right, don't tell anybody this,

37:43.928 --> 37:45.714
but I was Ernie, the Zamboni driver.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.174
(Andy laughs)

37:47.390 --> 37:48.675
(Sam laughs)

37:50.810 --> 37:52.311
Mm.

37:57.233 --> 37:59.064
I gotta go.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.021
We're being incredibly stupid.

38:02.071 --> 38:03.481
Yes, we are.

38:05.784 --> 38:08.446
I can never come back here...

38:08.495 --> 38:09.735
ever.

38:09.788 --> 38:11.949
(whispers) No.

38:11.998 --> 38:13.534
And you have to go.

38:13.583 --> 38:14.538
(whispers) Yeah.

38:14.584 --> 38:16.370
I do.

38:26.596 --> 38:28.336
(feet slide)

38:30.141 --> 38:31.347
(clatter)

38:31.392 --> 38:32.768
(Boyd clears throat)

38:32.811 --> 38:34.347
One point for arriving alive.

38:34.395 --> 38:37.102
Another point for arriving
on time, in uniform...

38:38.274 --> 38:40.435
kinda.

38:40.485 --> 38:41.691
Show me what you got.

38:43.613 --> 38:44.568
(Velcro rips)

38:44.614 --> 38:46.900
Well, I got...

38:46.950 --> 38:48.656
20 bucks...

38:48.701 --> 38:50.316
and a penny.

38:50.370 --> 38:52.861
(clears throat)
I got some, uh, coke.

38:54.123 --> 38:56.284
What about you?

38:56.334 --> 38:57.665
(Traci) What?

38:57.710 --> 38:59.371
— (Boyd) Uh, okay.
— (Oliver) Yeah.

38:59.420 --> 39:02.787
Epstein appears to be the winner,
by a large margin.

39:02.841 --> 39:04.331
Not that it was a competition.

39:04.384 --> 39:05.624
Yep.

39:05.677 --> 39:07.793
Pay up, losers.

39:09.097 --> 39:10.633
You bet on me?

39:10.682 --> 39:13.048
Yeah, you're, uh——
You're a simple kid, Epstein.

39:13.101 --> 39:16.013
A little doubting Thomas in your ear,
and you're gold. Thank you.

39:16.062 --> 39:17.051
(pats back)

39:18.940 --> 39:20.146
How'd you do it?

39:20.191 --> 39:21.806
I made friends with someone,

39:21.860 --> 39:24.943
got him to trust me, and then,
when he wasn't paying attention,

39:24.988 --> 39:26.853
l stabbed him in the back.

39:28.324 --> 39:30.155
Turns out I'm pretty good at it.

39:39.669 --> 39:41.910
Chris.

39:41.963 --> 39:44.921
Can I, uh——
Can I go home with you now?

39:49.053 --> 39:50.042
No.

39:50.096 --> 39:51.461
Come on.

39:51.514 --> 39:55.052
This is not like you.
You——You forgive.

39:55.101 --> 39:58.719
You——You understand.
You give second and third chances.

39:58.771 --> 40:02.764
You love puppies and ice cream,
and you have faith in people.

40:02.817 --> 40:05.274
Yeah. (sighs)

40:05.320 --> 40:07.106
| just don't have faith in us.

40:10.491 --> 40:13.107
Your hair's sticking up,
has been all night.

40:13.161 --> 40:14.992
I don't really care, Diaz.

40:16.664 --> 40:18.529
Welcome to the doghouse.

40:18.583 --> 40:19.948
We are not in the doghouse.

40:20.001 --> 40:22.242
We're out in the cold,
and it's over.

40:30.887 --> 40:33.594
— Hey.
— Well, look at you.

40:33.640 --> 40:34.880
(Chris) Heh.

40:34.933 --> 40:36.343
If you want a coffee
and a muffin, though,

40:36.392 --> 40:37.381
you got to get to the back
of the line, officer.

40:37.435 --> 40:38.766
No, thanks.

40:38.811 --> 40:40.096
Well, I hope you're
not here to arrest me,

40:40.146 --> 40:41.352
'cause I'm a little busy right now.

40:41.397 --> 40:44.104
No,no,no.
No, uh, it's this kid.

40:44.150 --> 40:45.811
Uh...

40:45.860 --> 40:48.101
I know this kid who might be
in a bit of trouble.

40:48.154 --> 40:49.985
I want to find some way
to help keep him

40:50.031 --> 40:51.567
on the straight and narrow, and...

40:51.616 --> 40:55.108
l was kind of hoping, if maybe he did
some volunteer work for your project,

40:55.161 --> 40:57.277
the prosecutor might be more lenient.

40:57.330 --> 40:59.571
Well, you know, I can always
use a helping hand.

40:59.624 --> 41:04.334
Good. Great. Thank you.

41:05.380 --> 41:06.415
You know, it takes a brave man

41:06.464 --> 41:08.375
to hang on to hope
in this day and age.

41:11.511 --> 41:15.174
Uh, you mind if I stick around
for a bit? Help out?

41:15.223 --> 41:17.009
I'd like that.
You can start right here.

41:17.058 --> 41:20.016
All right. Cool. Hey, guys.

41:24.190 --> 41:25.225
(Traci) You're quiet.

41:25.274 --> 41:26.400
(Andy) I'm just tired, that's all.

41:26.442 --> 41:27.852
Right.

41:27.902 --> 41:30.939
You know, big night,
lot to process.

41:30.989 --> 41:34.026
Sure, yeah.
Running into Swarek like that...

41:34.075 --> 41:35.781
must have reinstated your belief

41:35.827 --> 41:37.943
that something's meant
to happen with you guys.

41:37.996 --> 41:40.078
Ah, I didn't really think about it.

41:40.123 --> 41:42.580
— Okay, stop lying.
— What?

41:42.625 --> 41:44.741
I can't believe you went back there.

41:44.794 --> 41:46.580
(sighs) I didn't——
Who said I went back there?

41:46.629 --> 41:49.041
That is the dumbest thing
you have ever done.

41:49.090 --> 41:50.375
What is wrong with you?

41:50.425 --> 41:53.007
— What? I couldn't help it.
— (groans)

41:53.052 --> 41:56.544
Andy, you have to promise me
you're never going back there.

41:56.597 --> 41:58.258
It's way too dangerous.
You have no idea

41:58.307 --> 41:59.558
what kind of case
he's in the middle of.

41:59.600 --> 42:00.555
I know. I know.

42:00.601 --> 42:02.887
One—time thing, Trace.

42:09.819 --> 42:10.899
Was it good?

42:10.945 --> 42:13.687
(moans) Heavenly.

42:13.740 --> 42:17.358
Uaughs)
