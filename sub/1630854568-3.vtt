WEBVTT

00:00.634 --> 00:01.602
It's about my sister

00:01.669 --> 00:02.436
Lula Landry.

00:02.503 --> 00:03.671
I think she was murdered.

00:03.737 --> 00:06.274
- She was frightened of him.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.875
Tony's a little, uh..

00:07.941 --> 00:10.344
Family is a complex thing.

00:10.411 --> 00:12.446
- Uh, they sometimes clashed.

00:12.513 --> 00:15.849
Is anybody in the Deeby Macc
flat right now?

00:15.916 --> 00:17.718
Any deliveries here that day?

00:17.785 --> 00:21.822
Flowers, hoodie, leather gloves,
some fashion designer.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.324
Guy Some.

00:23.391 --> 00:25.459
So, first off,
we went to Vashti.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.428
It's a clothes shop
on Conduit Street.

00:27.495 --> 00:30.264
She met a mate in there,
Rochelle.

00:30.331 --> 00:31.865
Lula's best mate, Ciara Porter

00:31.932 --> 00:33.667
her rock star boyfriend,
Evan Duffield.

00:33.734 --> 00:37.971
Has anybody told you,
you are absolutely gorgeous?

00:38.038 --> 00:41.008
It was just so bland
and corporate.

00:41.075 --> 00:42.710
Like where I work, you mean?

00:45.079 --> 00:46.747
I don't really get hangovers.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.182
Well, that is lucky.

00:48.249 --> 00:51.185
Bastard leg's bloody killing me.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.094
'It was you.'

01:00.161 --> 01:02.263
You killed Lula.

01:05.966 --> 01:08.068
* You and me *

01:09.270 --> 01:12.005
* Me and you *

01:12.072 --> 01:17.077
* Somehow we make it through *

01:18.346 --> 01:21.014
* I maybe gone *

01:21.081 --> 01:23.217
* I may be far away *

01:24.985 --> 01:28.456
* But I walk beside you *

01:28.522 --> 01:32.493
* Every step of the way *

01:32.560 --> 01:35.229
* When you're used *

01:35.296 --> 01:36.864
* Bruised *

01:36.930 --> 01:39.300
* Black and blue *

01:39.367 --> 01:42.336
* Don't think about it *

01:44.004 --> 01:46.440
* Never doubt it *

01:46.507 --> 01:50.444
* I'll walk beside you **

01:53.314 --> 01:54.782
'Get a move on!'

02:31.752 --> 02:35.022
'Road clear ahead.
Maintain speed. Over.'

02:35.088 --> 02:36.624
'Roger that.'

02:39.393 --> 02:41.329
The unfortunate
Mrs. Anstis, right?

02:41.395 --> 02:43.130
Ah, bollocks.

02:43.197 --> 02:45.299
I'm a catch, mate.

02:52.039 --> 02:54.107
Can't wait to get home
and hold him for the first time.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.744
'Stand by,
obstruction to the front.'

03:01.782 --> 03:04.051
'One Afghan male changing tire.
Over.'

03:04.117 --> 03:05.386
Oi!

03:06.153 --> 03:07.688
'Yeah, move the van.'

03:07.755 --> 03:10.824
Move! Get in the van
and move it. Oi!

03:10.891 --> 03:13.160
'Holding, holding.'

03:13.227 --> 03:15.296
'Truck coming.
Trying to move him.'

03:17.631 --> 03:19.166
'Oi! Get in the van.'

03:19.233 --> 03:21.302
'Two Afghan children
on the road.'

03:24.538 --> 03:26.240
'Come on!'

03:31.412 --> 03:32.913
'Get in the van.'

03:32.980 --> 03:35.883
'Move the bloody van, move!'

03:35.949 --> 03:38.586
'Beware, Afghan male
moving to the front of..'

03:38.652 --> 03:41.322
'Moving to the front
of the vehicle, now..'

03:42.456 --> 03:44.157
'Roger that.'

03:44.224 --> 03:46.627
- 'Push on, push on.'
- 'Roger.'

03:48.362 --> 03:51.399
No, brake, brake, brake! Brake!

04:54.462 --> 04:57.030
Sergeant Strike, Strike,
can you hear me?

04:58.666 --> 05:00.968
Sergeant Strike,
can you hear me?

07:11.932 --> 07:13.066
Thank you.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.378
Can I help you?

07:25.445 --> 07:28.381
Uh, um...yes.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.818
I'd like to try on some dresses.

07:32.620 --> 07:35.155
Wow, it looks great on you.

07:37.390 --> 07:39.593
I'm just waiting on my brother
to check it out.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.161
It's for his wife, actually.

07:41.228 --> 07:43.430
Try the green one, I think it
will really suit your coloring.

07:43.497 --> 07:46.433
- Is she..
- Dark. Stunning, actually.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.802
Alright.

07:48.869 --> 07:51.505
Was that somebody famous
I just saw leaving?

07:51.572 --> 07:52.806
Not sure.

07:52.873 --> 07:54.407
Wasn't Ciara Porter, was it?

07:54.474 --> 07:58.211
No, I didn't see her. Although,
she does come in here sometimes.

07:58.278 --> 08:00.113
Lula Landry came in here a lot,
didn't she?

08:00.180 --> 08:01.849
Vashti was like always
in her lists.

08:01.915 --> 08:04.585
Like the top ten things
to do in London.

08:04.652 --> 08:06.286
Day she died..

08:06.353 --> 08:08.488
This changing room.

08:09.422 --> 08:11.058
No way.

08:11.124 --> 08:14.762
That's, like,
totally giving me goosebumps.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.366
You know, they say
she was going to meet Deeby Macc

08:19.432 --> 08:21.702
the night she died,
but, uh, I don't think Lula

08:21.769 --> 08:24.171
would ever cheat on Evan.

08:25.739 --> 08:28.241
- She was so gonna meet Deeby.

08:28.308 --> 08:29.476
Trust me.

08:29.543 --> 08:31.311
But she loved Evan!

08:31.378 --> 08:33.647
Did you see the pictures
of their commitment ceremony?

08:33.714 --> 08:37.517
Yeah? Well,
how about we heard them talking?

08:37.585 --> 08:39.186
- No, no.

08:39.252 --> 08:41.521
The skanky rude cow
she brought in with her.

08:41.589 --> 08:43.757
But Mel taped them
talking on her phone.

08:43.824 --> 08:46.326
- No way.
- Yeah, a bit naughty.

08:46.393 --> 08:48.862
We were all, like, not sure,
that's right really, but..

08:48.929 --> 08:50.163
Well, she swore it wasn't
for the press.

08:50.230 --> 08:53.834
'Just, you know,
play it to her mates.'

08:53.901 --> 08:56.336
- She's not in today.

08:56.403 --> 08:57.805
Day off. But trust me

08:57.871 --> 09:00.574
Lula Landry
was doing the dirty on Evan

09:00.641 --> 09:04.044
and who else it gonna be
but Deeby Macc?

09:04.111 --> 09:05.613
Come and have a look out there.

09:45.452 --> 09:47.587
What do you think?

09:48.722 --> 09:50.758
Yeah.

09:50.824 --> 09:54.194
"Yeah?" She look's amazing.

09:54.261 --> 09:55.896
But fair play, I guess.

09:55.963 --> 09:58.331
My brother would never
say that to me either.

10:19.586 --> 10:20.888
Very good.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.757
I'll go back for Mel later.

10:23.824 --> 10:25.425
Bit of a sore head this morning.

10:25.492 --> 10:26.827
Hmm.

10:26.894 --> 10:28.561
- Was I..
- You were fine.

10:28.628 --> 10:29.697
Mm-hmm.

10:29.763 --> 10:32.399
You were funny actually.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.367
Good.

10:34.434 --> 10:37.570
- I've had worse.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.873
- But not recently.
- Hm.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.218
Come and look at this.

10:58.291 --> 11:01.394
This is the figure
Bristow's so desperate to find.

11:02.930 --> 11:04.597
'He's walking towards
and away from the flats.'

11:04.664 --> 11:05.866
'A little bit agitated,
but, you know'

11:05.933 --> 11:06.967
could be a Deeby Macc fan

11:07.034 --> 11:09.002
waiting for a glimpse
of his hero.

11:09.069 --> 11:11.772
This is ten minutes
before Lula falls.

11:13.106 --> 11:16.109
'And then the next camera.'

11:16.176 --> 11:18.445
- Yeah.

11:18.511 --> 11:22.716
Same guy, walking quickly away,
less agitated, more purposeful.

11:22.783 --> 11:24.985
- It's not the same guy.

11:25.052 --> 11:27.087
Because his hoodie's
got a-a thingy, a logo on it.

11:27.154 --> 11:29.589
Exactly, yeah,
these are two different people.

11:29.656 --> 11:30.824
We can't see this guy's face

11:30.891 --> 11:33.861
but look at his hands.
Leather gloves.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.362
Guy Some dropped a hoodie
and gloves off

11:35.428 --> 11:36.864
to the Deeby Macc flat.

11:36.930 --> 11:38.598
So he could have used
the clothes as a disguise.

11:38.665 --> 11:41.268
Yeah,
I need to speak to Guy Some.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.536
And see if this second guy
really is wearing his clobber.

11:43.603 --> 11:45.605
Hmm. Well, good luck with that.

11:45.672 --> 11:48.108
You're coming with me.

11:48.175 --> 11:49.376
Oh.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.018
I feel like a woolly mammoth

11:58.085 --> 12:01.088
who's wandered
into the gazelle enclosure.

12:01.154 --> 12:03.991
Yeah. I was quite happy
with this handbag

12:04.057 --> 12:06.026
five minutes ago.

12:06.093 --> 12:07.427
Let's go.

12:09.529 --> 12:11.298
No, it's here now.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.000
Yeah. Just..

12:13.066 --> 12:14.634
- Excuse me.
- We're going with the feathers.

12:14.701 --> 12:17.270
We're doing the Milan shoot.

12:17.337 --> 12:18.738
Sorry.

12:34.822 --> 12:38.091
You don't have an appointment.

12:38.158 --> 12:40.828
So the mountain thought,
fuck it and came to Kevin.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.930
That's your real name, right?

12:42.996 --> 12:45.799
All I need you to do is identify
some items of clothing.

12:45.866 --> 12:48.068
Get out of my studio.

12:48.135 --> 12:50.270
I believe they may be yours
and it might have a bearing

12:50.337 --> 12:52.139
on Lula's death.

12:53.306 --> 12:55.275
Surely you're interested
in that.

12:57.510 --> 12:58.879
Come on.

13:00.047 --> 13:02.149
I think he likes you.

13:05.953 --> 13:08.255
That is your stuff, right?

13:09.756 --> 13:11.391
How did he get that?

13:11.458 --> 13:13.593
'Those haven't been
released yet.'

13:13.660 --> 13:14.862
These are definitely yours?

13:14.928 --> 13:16.363
You sure that's your nose?

13:16.429 --> 13:18.631
The doorman at Lula's flat
said he took some stuff

13:18.698 --> 13:19.967
from you for Deeby Macc.

13:20.033 --> 13:21.701
What'd you send him?

13:21.768 --> 13:24.071
- Tricia!
'

13:24.137 --> 13:25.873
'Bring me a Deeby Macc hoodie'

13:25.939 --> 13:28.075
and a pair of the new gloves.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.955
What did Lula make
of Deeby Macc?

13:42.022 --> 13:44.157
Nowhere near excited enough.

13:44.224 --> 13:45.692
I kept saying to her,
"Babes, if you'd written three

13:45.758 --> 13:49.129
"tracks about me, I'd be waitin'
behind that front door naked

13:49.196 --> 13:50.630
'when you got in."'

13:50.697 --> 13:53.867
'What I don't get,
is why she chose Duffield.'

13:53.934 --> 13:55.936
With all his white boy
tortured poet act

13:56.003 --> 13:58.538
when she was meant to be looking
for a lost black soul.

13:58.605 --> 14:00.607
How far did she get with that?

14:00.673 --> 14:02.609
She was looking for her dad,
'cause he was African.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.845
The mom was just some redneck
from Canning Town.

14:05.913 --> 14:08.681
'"Mrs. Methodone,"
we called her. Heh-heh.'

14:08.748 --> 14:11.618
'For a while, cuckoo
was always in the library.'

14:11.684 --> 14:13.286
'Got all excited
because apparently the old man'

14:13.353 --> 14:15.722
was some kind of
big shot academic.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.557
- I don't know.

14:17.624 --> 14:19.659
In Russell Square, somewhere.

14:19.726 --> 14:22.362
Wasn't really paying attention,
everyone switched off.

14:22.429 --> 14:23.997
- Apart from Rochelle.
- Yeah, well..

14:24.064 --> 14:26.466
She knew how to play Lula.

14:34.574 --> 14:36.143
Oh, I think they might be
a bit tight

14:36.209 --> 14:38.845
on your big hairy mitts.

14:38.912 --> 14:42.482
Though Ciara certainly
wasn't complaining about them.

14:42.549 --> 14:45.418
'Oh, no. You got quite
the five-star review, darlin'.'

14:46.619 --> 14:48.989
And she's had plenty
to compare you with.

15:50.050 --> 15:52.819
And we're in.

15:52.885 --> 15:55.155
So the argument starts,
voices rise.

15:55.222 --> 15:56.556
How do they get out
onto the balcony?

15:56.623 --> 15:58.058
She might have had
the door open already.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.159
Yeah, but it's snowing.

15:59.226 --> 16:00.260
When Lula often felt trapped

16:00.327 --> 16:01.928
she liked havin' 'em open.

16:01.995 --> 16:03.963
Or, as the argument escalates

16:04.031 --> 16:05.632
she turned around
to get away from him

16:05.698 --> 16:08.335
which is what I might do if I
wanted someone to just leave.

16:08.401 --> 16:11.571
Without realizing Tansy Bestigui
was shivering underneath.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.173
Mm-hmm.

16:16.943 --> 16:19.379
I think it was very sudden
and brutal.

16:19.446 --> 16:21.681
Tansy heard no cries for help?

16:21.748 --> 16:24.584
Well, I hope so,
but it was, uh, quick at least.

16:27.620 --> 16:30.690
Now, I have very little time,
so I make one big mistake

16:30.757 --> 16:32.725
and leave the flowers here.

16:32.792 --> 16:34.094
So they appear in a police shot

16:34.161 --> 16:36.429
immediately after the fall.

16:39.432 --> 16:42.202
Ah, I'm not
leaving them here to die.

16:48.941 --> 16:51.578
Walked down this road..

16:51.644 --> 16:53.180
...head bowed.

16:54.714 --> 16:57.217
And off I go,
hooded up and hands gloved.

16:57.284 --> 16:59.586
Having completely
got away with it.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.689
Oh. I found this, by the way.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.857
- It's a library card for--
- SOAS.

17:04.924 --> 17:08.128
- Hm.
- Russell Square.

17:08.195 --> 17:09.329
We could go there tomorrow
and find out

17:09.396 --> 17:10.363
what she was lookin' up.

17:10.430 --> 17:11.631
Yeah, I've got to meet

17:11.698 --> 17:13.700
Bristow in the morning.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.435
I could go on my own.

17:16.436 --> 17:17.504
Okay.

17:19.272 --> 17:21.408
- Good work today.
- Thanks.

17:35.021 --> 17:36.823
What are they?

17:36.889 --> 17:39.192
- Skateboards.
- I mean..

17:39.259 --> 17:41.794
We used 'em
in a crime re-enactment today.

17:45.732 --> 17:48.535
Look, I'm sorry
I was late last night.

17:50.103 --> 17:51.104
To be fair, I shoulda called.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.739
That's all I was sayin'.

17:52.805 --> 17:55.475
I'm not a control freak,
I'm just.. I'm worried.

17:55.542 --> 17:56.809
I know.

17:57.844 --> 17:59.712
It's not like you.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.348
Friends?

18:08.821 --> 18:11.558
Spoke to the mortgage
advisor today.

18:11.624 --> 18:12.692
Oh, yeah?

18:12.759 --> 18:14.294
We do need to get
our joint income up

18:14.361 --> 18:17.730
if we want to get a proper place
near a tube station

18:17.797 --> 18:20.167
and some decent schools.

18:23.503 --> 18:26.072
Have you told him,
you've taken the job yet?

18:26.139 --> 18:28.007
Not yet.

18:36.383 --> 18:38.285
Large whiskey.

18:43.022 --> 18:44.757
And a pint.

19:23.630 --> 19:26.566
'This is Charlie
before he died.'

19:26.633 --> 19:28.801
Playing cricket,
he was very good.

19:28.868 --> 19:30.303
I remember.

19:30.370 --> 19:33.606
Alec said he'd bowl
for England one day.

19:34.941 --> 19:38.978
And this is Lula,
the day she came to us.

19:39.045 --> 19:42.315
She loved those red mittens.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.853
'I still have them.'

19:46.919 --> 19:49.689
John says you collected
some items from her flat.

19:49.756 --> 19:52.058
Mm, keepsakes.

19:52.124 --> 19:54.894
- Some bits and pieces.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.630
You want me to put the film
on for you, Lady B?

19:57.697 --> 19:58.965
Hm.

20:02.502 --> 20:05.372
- Sure.

20:05.438 --> 20:08.808
- "Leopard."
- Oh, leopard.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.410
Dear old baby..

20:10.477 --> 20:12.345
Underscore, 1942.

20:12.412 --> 20:15.815
1942, the year I was born.

20:21.220 --> 20:25.292
Good morning. Oh, macaroons?

20:26.893 --> 20:28.695
You are lucky.

20:28.761 --> 20:30.730
Mr. Bone bought them for me.

20:30.797 --> 20:34.267
Really, thank you,
that's-that's..

20:34.334 --> 20:35.502
...that's very kind.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.570
Just a few quick things to ask.

20:37.637 --> 20:41.474
Did you know Lula was looking
for her biological family?

20:41.541 --> 20:44.477
Yes, I knew something about it.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.847
I tried to stay clear
of the topic..

20:48.581 --> 20:50.817
...for obvious reasons.

20:50.883 --> 20:52.819
You don't know
who the father is?

20:52.885 --> 20:55.054
Well, I still like to think
it was the man

20:55.121 --> 20:57.290
who actually
brought her up, but..

20:59.091 --> 21:01.127
I-I'm, I-I'm sorry, no.

21:01.193 --> 21:03.463
He was an African student.

21:03.530 --> 21:05.264
'Nigerian, I think.'

21:07.099 --> 21:09.001
Alec told me.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.905
He had to get another lawyer
to deal with the papers

21:12.972 --> 21:14.441
because Tony refused.

21:14.507 --> 21:17.710
- Didn't want us to have her.

21:17.777 --> 21:21.013
- Because of Charlie.

21:21.080 --> 21:24.283
Tony said something to Alec
that made my husband very angry

21:24.351 --> 21:25.985
and there was a fearful row.

21:26.052 --> 21:29.021
And Alec said, "Tony shouldn't
come to the house anymore."

21:29.088 --> 21:31.891
But he was my brother, so..
Oh, hush.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.426
This is a good bit.

21:34.927 --> 21:38.465
Well, they're in
for a big surprise.

21:38.531 --> 21:40.400
Last time we met,
you told me Tony was here

21:40.467 --> 21:42.502
the evening Lula died.

21:42.569 --> 21:44.937
You have a good memory.

21:45.004 --> 21:49.342
Uh, sorry, uh, yes.
Um, I was in the flat upstairs.

21:49.409 --> 21:51.411
While he was down with mom, uh..

21:51.478 --> 21:53.680
But I passed him
on the stairs suddenly.

21:53.746 --> 21:55.147
He didn't watch the film
with you?

21:55.214 --> 21:56.349
No, he left just before that.

21:56.416 --> 21:57.384
For Oxford.

21:57.450 --> 21:58.685
Yeah.

21:59.719 --> 22:01.821
Um, I-I-I will see
what I can find out

22:01.888 --> 22:03.623
regarding the adoption papers
though.

22:03.690 --> 22:05.358
That would be very helpful.

22:05.425 --> 22:08.227
She loved those mittens.

23:11.524 --> 23:14.160
Oh, hi. Back for the dress?

23:14.226 --> 23:16.696
No. Is Mel about?

23:16.763 --> 23:19.065
Down in the changing rooms.

23:24.270 --> 23:26.138
- Mm-hmm.

23:26.205 --> 23:29.776
My name is Cormoran Strike.
I work for Lula Landry's family.

23:29.842 --> 23:31.511
I'm here to explain to you
the legal hazards

23:31.578 --> 23:33.345
of recording
private conversations

23:33.412 --> 23:34.747
and sharing them
with third parties

23:34.814 --> 23:36.516
without obtaining consent.

23:36.583 --> 23:38.618
But first of all, you're gonna
give me the audio file

23:38.685 --> 23:40.820
you've got on your mobile.

23:50.062 --> 23:53.633
- 'Just sign it there.'
'

23:53.700 --> 23:55.502
'Never been surer, babe.'

23:55.568 --> 23:57.269
'They don't need it, do they?'

23:57.336 --> 23:58.871
'I can't believe it.'

23:58.938 --> 24:01.708
'I'm gonna see him tonight,
Roch. After all this time.'

24:01.774 --> 24:03.142
And that was the point,
she leaned out to see

24:03.209 --> 24:04.477
if anybody was listening.

24:04.544 --> 24:06.979
So paranoid, these celebrities.

24:08.414 --> 24:10.617
"I'm gonna see him tonight."

24:10.683 --> 24:12.685
What.. Deeby Macc?

24:12.752 --> 24:15.254
Well,
that's the obvious conclusion.

24:15.321 --> 24:16.422
How did you get on at SOAS?

24:16.489 --> 24:18.357
Okay. Ahem..

24:18.424 --> 24:20.993
So, Lula's search record shows

24:21.060 --> 24:23.663
that she was lookin' up books
on Ghanaian history.

24:23.730 --> 24:25.865
More specifically though,
she several times took out

24:25.932 --> 24:29.769
a PhD thesis
by a guy called Josiah Agyeman

24:29.836 --> 24:31.538
who was a student there.

24:31.604 --> 24:34.974
Agyeman. Not Nigerian?

24:35.041 --> 24:36.308
No, he's Ghanaian.

24:36.375 --> 24:39.111
The dedication to his PhD
looks interesting though.

24:43.315 --> 24:46.185
"For my beloved wife,
Ami and our baby Jonah

24:46.252 --> 24:48.521
"with grateful thanks
to pastor Jorge Duran

24:48.588 --> 24:50.122
'"of The Church of Holy Light'

24:50.189 --> 24:53.526
"for teaching humility and faith
to one who has so often strayed.

24:54.961 --> 24:57.296
One who has so often strayed."

24:57.363 --> 25:00.933
My guess would be that he might
be Lula's biological father.

25:01.568 --> 25:04.136
Yeah. Hm.

25:04.203 --> 25:06.739
Right, I've got to go
and meet a Professor Enright

25:06.806 --> 25:08.741
his PhD supervisor.

25:08.808 --> 25:11.410
He's still at SOAS, but
he was teaching this morning.

25:11.477 --> 25:12.912
See ya.

25:16.015 --> 25:17.750
'Ghanaian political economy.'

25:17.817 --> 25:20.086
Especially around the time
of Nkrumah.

25:20.152 --> 25:23.723
Um, actually, I was keen
to talk to Josiah Agyeman.

25:23.790 --> 25:27.093
I'm afraid Dr. Agyeman
is no longer with us.

25:27.159 --> 25:28.327
Oh, well, could you, um

25:28.394 --> 25:30.830
tell me where I might
be able get in touch with him?

25:30.897 --> 25:34.100
He died just over a year ago.

25:35.902 --> 25:38.070
Oh.

25:38.137 --> 25:41.107
You're not the first young lady
who's come asking about him.

25:44.443 --> 25:47.179
So, Lula must have found out
exactly the same thing as you.

25:47.246 --> 25:51.250
Hmm. Professor Enright said
she was very upset.

25:51.317 --> 25:53.019
He didn't know who she was?

25:53.085 --> 25:54.821
'He's a specialist
in post-colonial'

25:54.887 --> 25:57.657
administrative divisions
in Sub-Saharan Africa.

25:57.724 --> 25:59.258
I think the world
of celebrity fashion

25:59.325 --> 26:00.593
might have passed him by.

26:00.660 --> 26:02.829
So, Agyeman's
a complete dead end?

26:02.895 --> 26:06.132
No, because then
I tracked down Pastor Duran.

26:06.198 --> 26:09.301
The Pentecostalist he mentions
in his PhD dedication.

26:09.368 --> 26:12.605
The church is out in Tooting,
and he had a lot of pictures

26:12.672 --> 26:15.207
of the Agyeman family
including..

26:17.644 --> 26:19.345
Oh, not that one.

26:21.547 --> 26:23.415
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

26:23.482 --> 26:26.285
That's Agyeman
with his son, Jonah.

26:26.352 --> 26:28.487
'No doubt in where
she got her looks from.'

26:28.554 --> 26:29.588
Mm-hmm.

26:29.656 --> 26:31.457
'Blue, red, blue.'

26:31.523 --> 26:35.061
It's TRF,
it's Coldstream Guards.

26:38.831 --> 26:41.834
Lula said, "I can't believe
I'm gonna see him tonight."

26:43.502 --> 26:44.871
And in the changing room
at Vashti

26:44.937 --> 26:46.706
"I'm gonna see him
after all this time."

26:46.773 --> 26:49.876
She was expecting him,
not Deeby Macc.

26:49.942 --> 26:52.611
She thought she was going to see
her brother for the first time.

26:54.280 --> 26:55.547
You don't think that..

26:55.614 --> 26:57.817
I'll make some calls.

27:11.397 --> 27:12.398
Sad.

27:13.766 --> 27:15.902
I was so excited
about finding him and..

27:19.171 --> 27:22.208
There's usually something quite
sad, at the back of it all.

27:24.376 --> 27:25.678
Where are you going?

27:25.745 --> 27:28.214
Show John about Lula's brother.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.157
A brother?

27:39.892 --> 27:42.695
You know, that makes me
feel really strange.

27:42.762 --> 27:44.797
Of course it does.

27:44.864 --> 27:48.267
I-I-I hate the term
"Real brother."

27:48.334 --> 27:49.802
Or-or-or "Real parent."

27:49.869 --> 27:52.038
My real parents
were the ones who raised me.

27:52.104 --> 27:53.672
Definitely go along with that.

27:53.740 --> 27:55.007
Your

27:55.074 --> 27:56.575
As far as Johnny Rokeby
was concerned

27:56.642 --> 27:58.811
I was just a shudder
in the loins.

27:59.779 --> 28:02.815
So...this brother..

28:02.882 --> 28:05.117
This soldier is the one
in the CCTV footage?

28:05.184 --> 28:06.953
Keeping an open mind for now.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.455
So, do you think we should tell
the police about Agyeman?

28:13.659 --> 28:16.395
Sorry, John. I've got to go and
meet somebody pretty urgently.

28:16.462 --> 28:18.364
Oh, no, don't worry.

28:38.951 --> 28:40.152
Morning, sir.

28:40.219 --> 28:42.321
If you'd like
to follow me please.

29:00.973 --> 29:03.242
They told me
you were once a suit.

29:05.845 --> 29:07.413
Helmand, right?

29:21.293 --> 29:23.362
It's my fault
she killed herself.

29:24.831 --> 29:27.233
All of this is my fault.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.336
How's that?

29:30.402 --> 29:32.905
She wanted to see me
the night she died.

29:34.841 --> 29:37.776
In the end, I couldn't.

29:42.648 --> 29:44.450
That's you, right?

29:46.785 --> 29:49.155
Tell me what happened.

29:49.221 --> 29:51.423
Dad told me about it
when he was dyin'.

29:51.490 --> 29:54.493
Said he didn't know
she had the baby.

29:54.560 --> 29:57.463
'The woman
he lodged with in London.'

29:57.529 --> 30:00.366
He was a student at the time
and mom was in Accra.

30:00.432 --> 30:02.434
Then Lula calls you
out of the blue.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.270
She didn't want the press
to find out.

30:04.336 --> 30:07.106
- Yes, some Rochelle bird. Yeah.

30:07.173 --> 30:09.075
So, suddenly you find out
you've got a half-sister

30:09.141 --> 30:11.143
who's a world famous supermodel.

30:12.711 --> 30:15.281
It was all too much for me.
You know, doing my head in.

30:16.448 --> 30:20.119
Lula,
all them posh cars and flats.

30:20.186 --> 30:23.222
- And mom.
- I understand.

30:24.891 --> 30:26.225
Do you?

30:30.096 --> 30:32.364
Would've broken my mum's heart.

30:34.200 --> 30:36.268
Her health's not so good.

30:37.636 --> 30:39.405
And I said no to Lula at first.

30:39.471 --> 30:42.909
But then she-she kept on,
you know, k-kept on..

30:42.975 --> 30:45.577
- No.

30:45.644 --> 30:49.848
She was, I mean, you know,
she

30:49.916 --> 30:51.918
At one point, she was going on..

30:51.984 --> 30:53.552
"You can have all my money."

30:53.619 --> 30:56.923
And I-I said,
"I don't care about your money."

30:56.989 --> 30:58.757
I mean,
she was even going on about

30:58.824 --> 31:00.826
leavin' everything to me
in her will

31:00.893 --> 31:03.195
just to piss her uncle off.

31:04.964 --> 31:07.099
Afterwards, I felt so guilty.

31:10.669 --> 31:12.972
If I'd gone in..

31:13.039 --> 31:14.173
...she'd still be alive.

31:14.240 --> 31:16.108
Wanting to protect your mom

31:16.175 --> 31:17.876
was a good instinct.

31:19.311 --> 31:21.914
And she said
she understood about mom.

31:21.981 --> 31:24.783
And she didn't want
to hurt anyone.

31:26.385 --> 31:27.586
That's it.

31:29.255 --> 31:32.124
I mean, she was looking
for something, you know.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.829
She sounded alright.

31:41.700 --> 31:43.902
I think she was.

32:30.282 --> 32:32.418
- I'll call.
- Okay.

32:33.652 --> 32:36.255
I think I'll add
stalking to harassment.

32:37.789 --> 32:40.659
Your nephew said you were at
your sister's house in Chelsea

32:40.726 --> 32:42.728
the night of Lula's death.

32:42.794 --> 32:45.197
Is that correct?
It's your alibi.

32:45.264 --> 32:47.099
What on Earth
would I need an alibi for?

32:47.166 --> 32:48.200
You tell me.

32:48.267 --> 32:50.069
Can you prove
that I wasn't there?

32:50.136 --> 32:52.371
You used your credit card
to pay a bar bill

32:52.438 --> 32:54.606
in your favorite hotel
around about the same time

32:54.673 --> 32:57.576
you were supposed to be
with your sick sister.

32:57.643 --> 33:00.512
Why didn't you want
the Bristow's to adopt Lula?

33:02.548 --> 33:04.183
That's not..

33:06.485 --> 33:08.520
It wasn't..

33:08.587 --> 33:12.258
Yvette told me you didn't want
Lula around in the first place.

33:12.324 --> 33:14.093
Didn't stop you becoming
very interested

33:14.160 --> 33:17.063
in protecting her wealth.

33:17.129 --> 33:21.133
I always had Lula's best
interests at heart. Always.

33:21.200 --> 33:22.601
From day one.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.339
Chelsea.

34:20.826 --> 34:24.296
- Bunsen.

34:29.000 --> 34:33.639
Put some flowers on
your ma's grave the other day.

34:33.705 --> 34:35.707
Appreciate it.

34:35.774 --> 34:38.410
Something you want?

34:38.477 --> 34:41.313
This is a car registration
in its normal location.

34:41.380 --> 34:42.881
Oh, right. Want us to nick it?

34:42.948 --> 34:46.118
- No.

34:46.185 --> 34:48.820
Leave the car where it is,
don't nick anything.

34:48.887 --> 34:51.457
If you were to get inside
and check something for me--

34:51.523 --> 34:53.359
- 'The satnav.'

34:53.425 --> 34:55.361
'I want you to enter this
address, see if it comes up'

34:55.427 --> 34:57.663
'in previous destinations.'

35:01.099 --> 35:03.369
Hi, it's Robin Ellacott,
I came in..

35:03.435 --> 35:05.537
Yes, human resources.

35:05.604 --> 35:08.106
Well, I was just calling
to say that my circumstances

35:08.174 --> 35:11.009
have changed, so I won't be
able to accept the position.

35:11.076 --> 35:13.879
But if you could
pass on my appreciation.

35:15.013 --> 35:17.716
Yes, thank you. Thank you.

35:30.529 --> 35:32.664
- We didn't even discuss it.
- We did discuss it.

35:32.731 --> 35:34.833
Okay,
but we didn't decide anythin'.

35:34.900 --> 35:37.536
- This affects us both.
- Yeah, but primarily me.

35:37.603 --> 35:39.205
Look, I..

35:39.871 --> 35:41.373
I've..

35:41.440 --> 35:43.875
I've just,
I like the work I'm doing now.

35:45.277 --> 35:47.846
I've always dreamed
about a career like this.

35:47.913 --> 35:49.581
"Like this?"

35:49.648 --> 35:51.617
As I recall, it was psychology.

35:51.683 --> 35:54.119
Not doing the filing for a
one-legged investigator in Soho.

35:54.186 --> 35:57.456
I like the way you've made it

35:57.523 --> 36:00.526
all sound equally sleazy there.

36:00.592 --> 36:02.928
You know,
he lost his leg fighting a war.

36:02.994 --> 36:06.298
And what a bloody waste
of time and effort that was.

36:06.365 --> 36:09.668
Oh, what an awful thing to say.

36:09.735 --> 36:11.270
Well..

36:11.337 --> 36:14.440
Maybe if you met him.

36:16.275 --> 36:17.843
- "Met him."
- Yeah.

36:17.909 --> 36:20.979
We could...go for a drink
or something after work.

36:21.046 --> 36:24.483
And would I walk home on my own
while you tuck him up in bed?

36:27.486 --> 36:30.121
- Forget it then.
- I'm jokin'.

36:30.188 --> 36:31.590
I'm joking!

36:48.106 --> 36:50.942
Look, you think she was killed
because she made a will?

36:51.009 --> 36:53.612
No, I don't.
But Rochelle definitely was.

36:53.679 --> 36:55.514
I'm not with you.

36:55.581 --> 36:57.215
I think Rochelle
was blackmailing the killer

36:57.283 --> 36:59.851
because she was the only other
person who knew about the will.

36:59.918 --> 37:02.254
- I don't know.

37:06.258 --> 37:08.560
He'll kill again if he has to.

37:32.183 --> 37:34.620
- Cormoran Strike's office.

37:34.686 --> 37:36.422
Disputed estate to Richmond.

37:36.488 --> 37:38.189
- 'That's it.'
- All booked in.

37:38.256 --> 37:39.558
Great.

37:39.625 --> 37:41.092
There's actually something

37:41.159 --> 37:42.494
I wanted to talk to you about..

37:44.696 --> 37:45.931
Oh.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.736
I'd never sign up to be castaway

37:50.802 --> 37:53.872
on a desert island
with that one.

37:53.939 --> 37:57.042
Do you remember Tony
being here the night Lula died?

37:59.511 --> 38:03.415
Oh, it's all so blurry now.

38:03.482 --> 38:05.984
My long-term memory
is good enough.

38:06.051 --> 38:10.288
But the drugs make everything
so muddled.

38:10.356 --> 38:12.724
I understand.

38:12.791 --> 38:15.327
I remember you
and Charlie though.

38:15.394 --> 38:16.995
Thick as thieves.

38:18.664 --> 38:22.368
Your mother was a model
or something.

38:22.434 --> 38:23.902
That's right.

38:23.969 --> 38:27.305
Such a glamour puss.

38:27.373 --> 38:30.342
You don't look
anything like her.

38:30.409 --> 38:33.111
Johnny's not much
to look at either.

38:33.178 --> 38:35.313
My husband, Alec

38:35.381 --> 38:38.884
had a lot of homosexual friends.

38:38.950 --> 38:40.452
House of Lords.

38:40.519 --> 38:43.121
And he used to say,
he didn't in the least mind them

38:43.188 --> 38:45.323
being around young Jonny.

38:45.391 --> 38:48.026
"Just because
they're queer, Yvette

38:48.093 --> 38:51.730
doesn't mean to say
they have poor taste."

38:57.469 --> 38:59.337
Lunch time, Lady B.

38:59.405 --> 39:02.874
- Mm-hmm.

39:04.543 --> 39:06.378
'There you go.'

41:01.627 --> 41:03.061
He's upstairs.

41:47.773 --> 41:49.908
Wouldn't go in there for a bit.

42:05.323 --> 42:07.859
'The satnav
remembered the address.'

42:11.797 --> 42:13.599
- Right.
- 'And we found this.'

42:13.665 --> 42:15.701
Told you not to..

42:19.838 --> 42:21.106
Nah.

42:26.211 --> 42:27.779
Now, that's free.

42:29.380 --> 42:30.882
But my boy was heartbroken

42:30.949 --> 42:33.919
once he got in the car
and he couldn't take it.

42:33.985 --> 42:36.588
Hopefully
this will soothe the pain.

42:50.769 --> 42:53.071
I've got him, Wardle.

43:03.181 --> 43:06.785
Have you heard anything?
Has there been an arrest?

43:08.353 --> 43:10.155
Go home.

43:10.221 --> 43:12.858
Honestly,
I'm not expecting anybody now.

43:13.524 --> 43:14.893
Go on.

43:14.960 --> 43:17.362
Nothing's gonna happen tonight.

43:31.677 --> 43:33.511
I, um..

43:33.578 --> 43:36.114
I di-I didn't take
the job in HR.

43:37.115 --> 43:38.183
Oh.

43:39.685 --> 43:41.452
I'm not gonna be able
to afford you much longer

43:41.519 --> 43:42.988
once this job..

43:44.222 --> 43:45.356
I know.

43:47.926 --> 43:49.327
Night.

44:16.855 --> 44:19.024
I'm going to be
a bit late tonight.

44:43.081 --> 44:45.483
The chap they picked up
on the CCTV.

44:45.550 --> 44:46.718
They never traced him.

44:46.785 --> 44:48.253
That's you, right?

45:01.066 --> 45:04.269
She said she was
frightened of him.

45:11.142 --> 45:12.577
Get the fuck away from me!

45:57.522 --> 45:59.357
'Uh, hello?'

46:04.429 --> 46:05.997
Hello?

46:07.833 --> 46:09.968
Oh. It's only you, John.

46:10.035 --> 46:12.037
Oh, were you expecting
someone else?

46:12.103 --> 46:14.439
Maybe, yeah. But I'm glad.

46:14.505 --> 46:16.441
You want some pizza?
There's a slice left.

46:16.507 --> 46:18.810
Although I picked off
the pepperoni.

46:18.877 --> 46:20.812
Uh, no, thank you.

46:22.413 --> 46:23.982
Take a seat.

46:28.519 --> 46:30.221
Just for all the hard work.

46:30.288 --> 46:33.859
Tracking down Jonah Agyeman
was quite a result.

46:33.925 --> 46:36.061
That's really generous.

46:38.629 --> 46:40.198
Um..

46:40.265 --> 46:42.233
Marsha told me
you visited today.

46:42.300 --> 46:45.070
I-I was a little surprised,
to be honest.

46:45.136 --> 46:47.505
- No, thank you.

46:47.572 --> 46:48.840
Yeah, I-I-I got called out

46:48.907 --> 46:51.476
to visit a potential client
in Richmond

46:51.542 --> 46:54.279
but it turned out
they didn't exist.

46:56.848 --> 46:58.283
Yeah.

46:58.349 --> 47:00.618
I got my secretary to do that.

47:00.685 --> 47:02.820
I'm sorry, John, I needed you
out of the way for a bit.

47:05.523 --> 47:09.194
I have some distressing news
regarding Tony Landry.

47:12.197 --> 47:14.499
He knows you killed Lula.

47:15.867 --> 47:17.168
I'm sorry?

47:17.235 --> 47:19.938
He knows you killed Lula.

47:20.005 --> 47:22.307
'He might not admit it
to himself, but..'

47:23.541 --> 47:25.110
...deep down, he knows.

47:25.176 --> 47:28.479
It's impossible to know
something that isn't true.

47:31.216 --> 47:32.884
On the day Lula died..

47:35.353 --> 47:38.323
...you visited her flat.

47:38.389 --> 47:41.292
You were furious
she'd found Jonah.

47:44.862 --> 47:46.965
You left.

47:47.032 --> 47:49.167
You went downstairs

47:49.234 --> 47:50.936
but you didn't leave
the building.

48:03.748 --> 48:07.385
They were preparing the flat
for Deeby Macc's arrival.

48:11.189 --> 48:13.891
That helped you
with a few props.

48:34.845 --> 48:38.483
The flowers and the clothes
for your getaway.

48:44.622 --> 48:47.959
I don't know when you decided
to kill your sister.

48:48.026 --> 48:50.428
Just as I'll never know
the exact moment you decided

48:50.495 --> 48:52.330
to push your brother
over the edge of a quarry

48:52.397 --> 48:56.301
all those years before,
but you did decide.

48:57.568 --> 48:59.504
And then you went back.

49:16.587 --> 49:19.557
I-I-I'm very sorry, I-I'm not
awfully good at the kind of

49:19.624 --> 49:23.028
scornful denial
which I assume is my job here.

49:23.094 --> 49:25.030
I-I'm just.. I..

49:25.096 --> 49:27.698
I-I'm-I'm really disappointed.

49:27.765 --> 49:29.434
Open it.

49:32.370 --> 49:34.639
That's what you've been
looking for, isn't it?

49:34.705 --> 49:36.641
'It was in the Some handbag
that your mother'

49:36.707 --> 49:39.010
'took from Lula's flat.'

49:39.077 --> 49:40.545
You didn't know about
the detachable

49:40.611 --> 49:43.314
linings though, did you?

49:43.381 --> 49:45.483
'Been under your nose
all this time.'

49:46.584 --> 49:49.720
Rochelle knew of its existence,
obviously.

49:49.787 --> 49:52.290
- That's why you killed her.
- I've never met her.

49:52.357 --> 49:56.161
Then why did your satnav prompt
her address when we entered it?

49:58.729 --> 50:01.532
Rochelle wasn't such
a good friend to Lula.

50:01.599 --> 50:03.601
She decided to blackmail you
over the will.

50:03.668 --> 50:06.404
Of course, she had no idea
what you were capable of.

50:07.305 --> 50:09.006
What you'd already done.

50:13.711 --> 50:17.982
Lula told you all about the
will in your second argument.

50:18.049 --> 50:20.118
And that sealed her fate.

50:26.124 --> 50:28.025
It all went to mom.

50:28.093 --> 50:29.160
Lula died intestate.

50:29.227 --> 50:31.162
I inherited nothing.

50:31.229 --> 50:32.730
Yeah, but you will
when your mother dies

50:32.797 --> 50:33.764
which won't be long.

50:35.700 --> 50:38.536
But I think money
was always a secondary motive..

50:39.237 --> 50:41.072
...to envy.

50:44.409 --> 50:47.412
This is the bell
from Charlie's bike, isn't it?

50:47.478 --> 50:50.448
The one he was riding
when he fell into the quarry.

50:51.649 --> 50:55.386
First your brother, Charlie.
Then Lula.

50:55.453 --> 50:58.289
'Then you hired me
to help you frame Jonah.'

50:58.356 --> 50:59.690
I have some sympathy
for you here

50:59.757 --> 51:02.727
with your mother's
endless categorizing.

51:02.793 --> 51:05.830
The handsome one,
the clever one, the funny one.

51:07.265 --> 51:09.167
You were always
just the second one.

51:09.234 --> 51:10.835
Oh, please.

51:10.901 --> 51:12.937
Anything but the cod psychology.

51:13.003 --> 51:15.640
No, fine, sure. I'm not
a big one for motive actually.

51:15.706 --> 51:18.109
Although,
juries are suckers for it.

51:18.176 --> 51:20.911
Let's stick
with what we actually know.

51:20.978 --> 51:22.513
Tony always suspected you

51:22.580 --> 51:24.349
of involvement
in Charlie's death

51:24.415 --> 51:26.251
and tried to stop your parents
adopting again

51:26.317 --> 51:28.018
because he was frightened
for Lula.

51:28.085 --> 51:29.387
And he told you that, did he?

51:29.454 --> 51:31.822
He was nowhere near
your house that night.

51:31.889 --> 51:34.492
First, that made me suspicious,
but then I realized

51:34.559 --> 51:36.461
that you giving him
an alibi meant that

51:36.527 --> 51:39.063
he was effectively
giving one to you.

51:39.130 --> 51:42.333
'Tony Landry
is a weak-willed coward.'

51:43.934 --> 51:46.371
But he's not a murderer.

51:46.437 --> 51:47.705
You are.

51:55.146 --> 51:57.382
We're done here.

52:02.287 --> 52:04.422
Your mother's a dead junkie.

52:04.489 --> 52:07.458
Your father doesn't even
want to know you exist.

52:07.525 --> 52:10.228
You're in debt
up to your eyeballs

52:10.295 --> 52:13.298
and you live in your office
eating junk food.

52:15.433 --> 52:16.967
Good luck taking that
to the police.

52:17.034 --> 52:18.836
I already have.

52:18.903 --> 52:21.706
You should know by the way,
that leather is porous.

52:21.772 --> 52:23.508
It doesn't prevent
the transmission

52:23.574 --> 52:26.377
of forensic evidence.
It's a common mistake.

52:26.444 --> 52:29.547
But it actually
just causes criminals to sweat.

52:29.614 --> 52:32.317
Especially when they're as hyped
up as you were that night.

52:33.584 --> 52:36.421
You're going to prison
for two murders, John.

52:36.487 --> 52:38.389
Should be three, of course.

52:45.129 --> 52:46.397
John..

52:46.464 --> 52:48.733
You know it's over.

53:22.933 --> 53:24.835
Cormoran?

53:27.372 --> 53:28.473
'Cormoran?'

53:28.539 --> 53:29.740
'Get out!'

53:47.124 --> 53:48.859
Cormoran?

53:48.926 --> 53:51.696
Cormoran, stop!
Stop! Stop it! Stop!

53:55.132 --> 53:57.335
Fuck.

53:57.402 --> 54:00.838
You're really bleeding.
I'll call an ambulance.

54:01.972 --> 54:03.741
And a taxi.

54:05.443 --> 54:07.845
I'm not traveling
with that bastard.

54:56.927 --> 54:59.930
I was sorry to hear
about Lady Bristow.

54:59.997 --> 55:01.966
It was time.

55:02.032 --> 55:04.435
In the end,
it was very peaceful.

55:06.036 --> 55:08.639
So, why did you want to see me?

55:08.706 --> 55:10.875
Before she died,
my sister and I agreed

55:10.941 --> 55:13.010
that we would
respect Lula's wishes

55:13.077 --> 55:14.745
with regard to Jonah Agyeman.

55:14.812 --> 55:15.680
Okay.

55:15.746 --> 55:17.615
I will also pay
any outstanding fees

55:17.682 --> 55:19.950
or expenses due to you.

55:20.017 --> 55:21.419
Thank you.

55:22.920 --> 55:26.056
I fear you have a low opinion
of me, Mr. Strike.

55:28.959 --> 55:33.330
I never knew for certain what
happened with John and Charlie

55:33.398 --> 55:34.965
when they were at the quarry
that day.

55:35.032 --> 55:38.335
You were anxious enough to try
and stop them adopting Lula.

55:38.403 --> 55:40.738
So, imagine what would have
happened if I'd told Yvette

55:40.805 --> 55:42.540
that he might
also have killed Lula.

55:42.607 --> 55:45.743
Imagine what that
would have done to her.

55:45.810 --> 55:47.678
She never really got over
Charlie's death

55:47.745 --> 55:50.781
and...she was dying herself.

56:01.025 --> 56:02.126
Families.

56:02.993 --> 56:04.729
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

56:17.808 --> 56:19.677
Yes, of course,
I'll make sure I pass that on.

56:19.744 --> 56:22.413
Thank you very much. Bye.

56:22.480 --> 56:24.749
'Phone hasn't stopped ringing.'

56:30.154 --> 56:31.922
Thank you.

56:57.181 --> 56:59.016
I know what it cost, remember?

57:00.150 --> 57:01.852
Think of it as a bonus.

57:06.156 --> 57:07.858
I never did tell you.

57:09.026 --> 57:10.728
Tell me what?

57:11.896 --> 57:13.931
What it was that
I-I wanted to say

57:13.998 --> 57:17.034
the night that
John Bristow attacked you.

57:20.971 --> 57:23.107
I'm tired
of pointless interviews.

57:25.275 --> 57:27.812
I like it here.

57:27.878 --> 57:31.248
Well, Tony Landry
kept his promise and paid up.

57:31.315 --> 57:32.683
I've cleared my debts.

57:34.184 --> 57:35.620
So..

57:42.426 --> 57:44.394
Can we make this permanent?

57:44.461 --> 57:46.096
Yeah.

57:46.163 --> 57:48.098
You might be waiting a while
for a pay rise.

57:49.534 --> 57:52.069
Oh, that's fine.

57:52.136 --> 57:53.504
Alright.

57:56.574 --> 57:58.676
Oh.

57:58.743 --> 58:01.646
Cormoran Strike's office.

58:01.712 --> 58:03.548
'Well, we're pretty busy
at the moment'

58:03.614 --> 58:05.449
'but if you give me
your contact details'

58:05.516 --> 58:07.484
'then I'll, uh..'

58:13.658 --> 58:15.125
'Uh-huh.'

58:16.460 --> 58:18.729
'Okay, thank you very much. Bye'

58:41.318 --> 58:44.421
* Poor old granddad *

58:44.488 --> 58:47.692
* I laughed at all his words *

58:47.758 --> 58:50.895
* I thought
he was a bitter man *

58:50.961 --> 58:54.031
* He spoke of women's ways *

58:54.098 --> 58:57.668
* They trap you
then they use you *

58:57.735 --> 59:00.838
* Before you even know *

59:00.905 --> 59:04.308
* For love is blind
and you're far too kind *

59:04.374 --> 59:07.578
* Don't ever let it show *

59:07.645 --> 59:12.683
* I wish that
I knew what I know now *

59:12.750 --> 59:14.084
* But when I was younger *

59:14.151 --> 59:19.423
* I wish that
I knew what I know now *

59:19.489 --> 59:21.959
* I will be stronger **
