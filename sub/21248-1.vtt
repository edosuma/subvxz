02:01:42.003 --> 02:01:43.163
-The engagement ring.
-Are you kidding?

02:01:43.338 --> 02:01:46.546
I've been carrying this since 2008.

02:01:49.219 --> 02:01:50.334
Okay.

02:01:50.512 --> 02:01:52.093
I think I can think
of something better than that.

02:01:52.263 --> 02:01:54.629
Well, it would buy us a little time.

02:01:55.934 --> 02:01:58.050
Like we need time.

02:01:58.228 --> 02:01:59.889
PEPPER: I can't believe you have that
in your pocket.

02:02:00.063 --> 02:02:02.554
-Want me to get the door for you, hon?
-I got it.

slice his throat, put his head in a dryer.

here to talk to you...

...about one of the most valuable traits
a soldier or student can have.

And you wonder...

02:12:51.464 --> 02:12:55.298
...why you waited so long
for something so disappointing.

02:12:59.013 --> 02:13:01.004
