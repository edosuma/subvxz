WEBVTT

00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
¶¶

00:03.637 --> 00:05.904
(theme music playing)

00:09.010 --> 00:12.277
¶ I got the wind in my hair
and a fire within ¶

00:12.279 --> 00:14.646
¶ 'Cause there's something
beginning ¶

00:14.648 --> 00:16.482
¶ I got a mystery to solve ¶

00:16.484 --> 00:20.019
¶ And excitement to spare ¶

00:20.021 --> 00:23.155
¶ Got a beautiful breeze
blowing through ¶

00:23.157 --> 00:28.127
¶ I'm ready to follow it
who knows where ¶

00:28.129 --> 00:30.863
¶ And I'll get there I swear ¶

00:43.911 --> 00:46.578
So it comes to this...

00:46.580 --> 00:48.113
war!

00:49.250 --> 00:50.349
(shouts)

00:50.351 --> 00:53.018
Dad, please!

00:53.020 --> 00:56.255
You're not thinking clearly.
This is a huge mistake.

00:56.257 --> 00:57.689
Guards!

00:57.691 --> 00:59.358
Seize the princess

00:59.360 --> 01:00.592
and her friends.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.430
Dad, no!

01:04.432 --> 01:06.265
Don't do this!

01:08.235 --> 01:11.403
King Frederic: Nothing is
more important than peace.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.771
Yes, but, Your Majesty,

01:12.773 --> 01:15.340
your proposed trade accord
with the Griffin of Pittsford

01:15.342 --> 01:17.342
weighs greatly
in his favor.

01:17.344 --> 01:20.879
-Corona stands to lose--
-Corona can afford it, Nigel.

01:20.881 --> 01:24.049
By cementing this trade,
we secure peace between
our two nations.

01:24.051 --> 01:25.717
By allowing it to dissolve,

01:25.719 --> 01:28.353
we risk sending the seven
kingdoms on a path to war.

01:28.355 --> 01:30.789
But how do we know
if the Griffin will accept?

01:30.791 --> 01:32.925
He's notoriously insecure,

01:32.927 --> 01:34.726
and he's been known
to walk away from the table

01:34.728 --> 01:36.462
at the slightest offense.

01:36.464 --> 01:39.198
Nigel, my friend,
you are far too uptight.

01:39.200 --> 01:40.799
Besides, the Griffin's
welcoming banquet

01:40.801 --> 01:41.900
is in good hands.

01:41.902 --> 01:44.770
And so, to you, the wise Griffin
of Pittsford,

01:44.772 --> 01:47.739
I say, let us treat
our new friendship

01:47.741 --> 01:49.208
like a budding flower,

01:49.210 --> 01:51.376
one we will nurture with love,

01:51.378 --> 01:54.980
knowing that it will bloom
into something beautiful.

01:54.982 --> 01:57.049
(whinnies)

01:57.051 --> 01:59.952
Uh, I don't think you're
going to win over the Griffin

01:59.954 --> 02:02.788
with a schmaltzy speech
about puppies and rainbows.

02:02.790 --> 02:05.424
I didn't say anything
about puppies!

02:05.426 --> 02:08.961
The rainbow was a metaphor.
(sighs)

02:08.963 --> 02:11.263
Uh, so how's your
prep work going

02:11.265 --> 02:13.432
for running your first
security checkpoint?

02:13.434 --> 02:15.467
Let's put it this way.

02:15.469 --> 02:19.638
There is nothing my station
isn't going to be ready for.

02:19.640 --> 02:22.908
Ha ha!
Fog machine, baby!

02:22.910 --> 02:25.644
Uh, Eugene,
why do you need that?

02:25.646 --> 02:28.480
You made me the emcee,
remember?

02:30.484 --> 02:31.850
Picture this:

02:31.852 --> 02:33.318
Lights go dim.

02:33.320 --> 02:36.488
The fog rolls in.

02:36.490 --> 02:38.157
(coughing)

02:38.159 --> 02:40.926
And all eyes are on me,

02:40.928 --> 02:42.361
as it should be.

02:42.363 --> 02:43.695
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:43.697 --> 02:45.497
let's show the Griffin

02:45.499 --> 02:48.100
just how we do things
in Corona.

02:48.102 --> 02:53.805
It's time to get this
party started!

02:53.807 --> 02:55.874
-(coughs)
-I'll hold it just that long.

02:55.876 --> 02:57.709
No. No way, Eugene.

02:57.711 --> 02:59.878
Fog would make it impossible

02:59.880 --> 03:02.047
to see clearly enough
to do my job.

03:02.049 --> 03:04.883
A fog machine does seem
a bit unnecessary.

03:04.885 --> 03:08.287
Look, Blondie,
I love you and I don't
want to point fingers,

03:08.289 --> 03:09.655
mostly because
I just got mine manicured

03:09.657 --> 03:11.356
and I don't want
to show anyone up,

03:11.358 --> 03:14.159
but if you really want
to talk about unnecessary,

03:14.161 --> 03:17.196
we should probably discuss
the gift baskets you made.

03:18.566 --> 03:21.333
Seriously, did you really
have to paint a portrait

03:21.335 --> 03:22.568
for every guest?

03:23.704 --> 03:27.072
Do you really need
six guards at your checkpoint?

03:28.375 --> 03:31.243
Sorry!
Ugh, that was so rude.

03:31.245 --> 03:32.978
Ah, that's my girl.

03:32.980 --> 03:34.546
You can't even argue
without being nice.

03:34.548 --> 03:37.382
Yeah. Do you always
have to be so...

03:37.384 --> 03:38.483
you?

03:38.485 --> 03:41.153
Well, it's better than
always being callous.

03:41.155 --> 03:43.555
I'm not callous.
I am practical.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.757
Eugene:
Yeah, practically heartless.

03:45.759 --> 03:48.193
Ah, boy. Here we go again.

03:48.195 --> 03:50.095
That's, like, their third
fight this week.

03:50.097 --> 03:52.431
They sound like my in-laws.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.433
If I had in-laws.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.535
Boy, I wish
I were married.

03:56.537 --> 03:59.171
(gasps)
Self-absorbed?

03:59.173 --> 04:01.607
How dare you!
I don't have to take this.

04:01.609 --> 04:03.508
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to the market

04:03.510 --> 04:05.711
to buy more props
for my big night!

04:05.713 --> 04:07.579
Guys, hold on.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.014
We've all been under
a lot of pressure

04:09.016 --> 04:10.616
getting ready
for this banquet.

04:10.618 --> 04:12.451
How about we take a breather

04:12.453 --> 04:14.419
and go to the marketplace
together?

04:14.421 --> 04:16.188
(harrumphs)

04:16.190 --> 04:18.190
Hmm.

04:18.192 --> 04:20.659
(sighs)

04:23.631 --> 04:26.298
Oh! A confetti cannon's
a great idea.

04:26.300 --> 04:28.367
My fan's are gonna love it.

04:28.368 --> 04:30.435
-Tell her, Blondie.
-Yeah, I'm not gonna
tell her that.

04:30.437 --> 04:31.970
Put it down, Eugene.

04:31.972 --> 04:34.606
There is no way
you're bringing that thing
back to the castle.

04:34.608 --> 04:37.476
Oh, so now you're
taking her side, huh?

04:37.478 --> 04:39.645
I'm not taking
anyone's side, Eugene.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.947
-Well, maybe you
should for once.
-Okay.

04:41.949 --> 04:45.884
Then sign me up
for the side that says,
"This is all ridiculous."

04:45.886 --> 04:47.286
Seems like our friends

04:47.288 --> 04:48.654
are going through
a rough patch.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.389
(knickers)

04:50.391 --> 04:53.058
I've seen this many times.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.559
They are the growing pains

04:54.561 --> 04:57.663
that all strong relationships
must endure.

04:59.166 --> 05:02.267
Eventually, they will learn
to live with each other's flaws

05:02.269 --> 05:04.469
and appreciate their strengths,

05:04.471 --> 05:07.406
but that sort of thing
takes time.

05:09.276 --> 05:13.545
But, if you'd like to speed
things along...

05:15.449 --> 05:17.616
this mood tonic may help to...

05:17.618 --> 05:20.585
soften some of those flaws.

05:20.587 --> 05:24.589
One drop for each of them
is all it will take.

05:24.591 --> 05:26.024
One.

05:26.026 --> 05:27.492
Understand?

05:27.494 --> 05:29.227
(snorts)

05:30.998 --> 05:33.665
Good call, Xavier, old boy.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.902
The fate of those kids
could not be in safer hands.

05:38.305 --> 05:40.605
Don't you dare
break my cannon!

05:40.607 --> 05:42.174
Cassandra:
And I'm gonna break
more than that

05:42.176 --> 05:44.142
if you don't cool it
with these props.

05:44.144 --> 05:45.677
Rapunzel:
Stop yelling!

05:45.679 --> 05:48.113
-Everybody, stop yelling!
-Eugene: Hey, hey, hey!
Hands off!

05:48.115 --> 05:49.548
(grunts)

05:49.550 --> 05:51.016
-Cassandra: Give me that!
-Eugene: No!

05:51.018 --> 05:52.818
(crashes)

05:52.820 --> 05:54.686
Eugene:
Oh, well, nice going, Cass!

05:54.688 --> 05:56.621
You broke my confetti cannon.

05:56.623 --> 05:59.157
Cassandra:
You're lucky. I was aiming
for your face!

05:59.159 --> 06:01.026
-(door slams open)
-(screams)

06:04.164 --> 06:06.898
Rapunzel:
Cass, unh-uh!
Put your sword down.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.700
And that dagger!

06:08.702 --> 06:10.202
Come on!

06:10.204 --> 06:11.703
Wait, wait, wait...

06:11.705 --> 06:13.338
(thuds)

06:13.340 --> 06:15.574
Hey, let's all have
some lemonade.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.008
I know I could use some.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.143
-(snorts)
-(squeaks)

06:18.145 --> 06:19.644
Thanks, little buddy.

06:19.646 --> 06:22.581
My throat was getting all sore
from all this yelling.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.717
At least someone around here

06:25.719 --> 06:26.818
is considerate.

06:27.755 --> 06:29.254
(squeaking)

06:29.256 --> 06:30.722
Blech!

06:30.724 --> 06:32.457
Really not a fan of lemonade.

06:33.594 --> 06:36.728
It's bitter. I like it.

06:36.730 --> 06:38.597
Why am I not surprised?

06:38.599 --> 06:40.065
You know what, Eugene?

06:41.668 --> 06:44.569
I can kind of see
how that cannon would be fun.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.671
but at least consider the risk.

06:49.610 --> 06:52.043
What was I thinking?

06:52.045 --> 06:53.245
(neighs)

06:53.247 --> 06:55.580
You are so right,
Cassandra.

06:55.582 --> 06:59.117
Firing a cannon
could be dangerous!

06:59.119 --> 07:00.919
(squeaking)

07:00.921 --> 07:02.788
-(crashes)
-(gasps)

07:02.790 --> 07:04.589
(loud crash)

07:04.591 --> 07:06.691
(gasps)
You guys okay?

07:10.731 --> 07:13.398
Good, because then
you can make me a sandwich

07:13.400 --> 07:16.268
to get the taste of this
lemonade out of my mouth.

07:19.239 --> 07:20.772
Rapunzel:
The Griffin had better
appreciate

07:20.774 --> 07:22.474
all the work we're
putting into this banquet.

07:22.476 --> 07:25.143
"So, in conclusion, Griffin,

07:25.145 --> 07:27.412
Pittsford... is the pits."

07:27.414 --> 07:29.614
Wow, that was super!

07:29.616 --> 07:32.551
Way to flip the script
on the whole "welcome" thing.

07:32.553 --> 07:34.753
-What do you think, Eugene?
-Me?

07:34.755 --> 07:36.788
Uh... oh... uh...

07:36.790 --> 07:39.090
Uh, well, I mean this
in the kindest way possible,

07:39.092 --> 07:41.226
but it seems the whole point
of this banquet

07:41.228 --> 07:43.795
is to, you know,
impress the Griffin,

07:43.797 --> 07:46.898
and if that's the case,
then I might...

07:46.900 --> 07:48.733
um...

07:48.735 --> 07:50.802
consider saying something
completely opposite of what
you just said.

07:52.473 --> 07:53.772
(scoffs)
Really?

07:53.774 --> 07:55.674
Grow a spine, Fitzherbert.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.242
I'm just calling it
like it is.

07:57.244 --> 07:59.077
Uh-oh!

07:59.079 --> 08:01.313
You sound upset.

08:01.315 --> 08:03.114
Tickle fight!

08:03.116 --> 08:05.750
Rapunzel:
Stop it! Leave me alone!

08:05.752 --> 08:07.652
Stan? Pete?

08:07.654 --> 08:09.321
Uh, was there something

08:09.323 --> 08:11.456
you would like to contribute
to this discussion?

08:11.458 --> 08:13.592
Oh, sorry, Your Highness.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.293
You've been all acting

08:15.295 --> 08:17.429
a little unusual lately.

08:17.431 --> 08:19.598
Is that so?
And--and just how

08:19.600 --> 08:21.700
are we acting unusual,
pinhead?

08:21.702 --> 08:23.668
Well, you just called me
"pinhead," for one.

08:23.670 --> 08:25.804
So?!

08:25.806 --> 08:28.640
Wait, wait a second.
What is going on here?

08:28.642 --> 08:30.008
It's like--
(groans)

08:30.010 --> 08:33.111
It's like
we're the total opposite
of who we are, normally.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.683
I have been feeling
a little peppy.

08:38.685 --> 08:41.620
And I'm not my normal,
confident self.

08:41.622 --> 08:43.855
(crying)
And I'm really sorry
for that.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.857
Can it! I gotta think!

08:47.794 --> 08:49.027
(nickers)

08:49.963 --> 08:52.664
Pascal! Maximus!

08:52.666 --> 08:54.499
What did you two do?

08:54.501 --> 08:56.668
And don't try to cute-squeak
your way out of this,

08:56.670 --> 08:59.471
'cause this princess
ain't buying it!

09:00.407 --> 09:01.806
What?

09:01.808 --> 09:04.976
I was trying to help Max
and Pascal teach you a lesson.

09:04.978 --> 09:06.978
The tonic brings out
the opposite

09:06.980 --> 09:09.848
of your defining
personal characteristics.

09:09.850 --> 09:12.751
So that's why
I'm less cheerful,

09:12.753 --> 09:14.219
Eugene's a wimp,

09:14.221 --> 09:16.555
-and Cass--
-Wee!

09:16.557 --> 09:18.990
Best opposite day, ever!

09:20.894 --> 09:22.727
I don't understand it.

09:22.729 --> 09:24.763
The effect should have
subsided by now.

09:26.199 --> 09:29.334
It was supposed to be
one drop each.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.770
This much will take
days to wear off.

09:31.772 --> 09:33.605
Days?!

09:33.607 --> 09:35.941
Oh! The banquet
is tonight!

09:35.943 --> 09:37.776
You know what?
I take responsibility
for this.

09:37.778 --> 09:39.744
Wait, no.
I'm sorry, I don't.

09:39.746 --> 09:41.379
Responsibility
terrifies me.

09:41.381 --> 09:43.548
Listen,
I can concoct an elixir

09:43.550 --> 09:46.284
that will reverse
your personalities
back to normal.

09:46.286 --> 09:49.854
But I'll need the oil
from the three-leaf
echo plant,

09:49.856 --> 09:52.123
found only atop Mount Saison.

09:52.125 --> 09:54.960
The three-leaf
is extremely rare

09:54.962 --> 09:57.562
and grows among its
two-leaf cousin.

09:57.564 --> 09:59.464
It's a two-hour trek.

09:59.466 --> 10:03.301
Huzzah! Non-paved road trip
with my two best buds.

10:03.303 --> 10:05.737
There is no time
to go ourselves.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.205
Max, Pascal,

10:07.207 --> 10:08.907
you clowns got us
into this mess,

10:08.909 --> 10:10.809
now you have
to get us out of it!

10:10.811 --> 10:12.210
(snorts)

10:13.647 --> 10:16.615
¶ ¶

10:24.992 --> 10:27.926
Xavier (in voice-over):
The three-leaf
is extremely rare

10:27.928 --> 10:30.729
and grows among
its two-leaf cousin.

10:30.731 --> 10:31.997
(squeaks)

10:31.999 --> 10:33.732
(nickers)

10:34.668 --> 10:37.502
(dramatic music plays)

10:37.504 --> 10:38.803
(squeaks)

10:40.641 --> 10:43.108
(indistinct chatter)

10:43.110 --> 10:45.110
Be tough. Be tough.

10:45.112 --> 10:46.244
(sighs)

10:46.246 --> 10:49.080
(thudding footsteps)

10:52.152 --> 10:54.452
Why, hello there, sweetie.

10:54.454 --> 10:56.655
May I please see
your invitation?

10:56.657 --> 10:57.956
I lost it.

10:57.958 --> 11:00.592
Oh... what the heck?

11:00.594 --> 11:02.927
You look trustworthy.
Come on in.

11:10.037 --> 11:13.605
It's nice to meet someone
who's not afraid to show
some compassion.

11:16.143 --> 11:18.343
Cassandra,
you just let that man in

11:18.345 --> 11:20.545
without a proper
security check.

11:20.547 --> 11:22.447
I can't believe
your poor judgment.

11:22.449 --> 11:24.816
You are relieved
of your security duty.

11:24.818 --> 11:27.519
Aw, fiddlesticks.

11:29.956 --> 11:32.190
Hey, buddy, wait up!

11:37.964 --> 11:39.330
(neighs)

11:39.332 --> 11:40.965
(squeaking)

11:48.041 --> 11:49.174
(gasps)

11:49.176 --> 11:50.875
(groans)

11:53.246 --> 11:55.647
(snoring)

11:58.985 --> 12:02.087
¶ ¶

12:10.363 --> 12:12.430
(whinnies)

12:12.432 --> 12:14.666
(fanfare playing)

12:14.668 --> 12:17.435
(yawns)

12:17.437 --> 12:19.938
Boring.

12:24.077 --> 12:25.944
May I present...

12:25.946 --> 12:27.245
(scoffs)

12:27.247 --> 12:29.981
...the Griffin
of Pittsford.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.888
-My goodness.
-(gasps, whispers)

12:36.890 --> 12:38.523
(clears throat)

12:38.525 --> 12:39.891
Your Excellency,

12:39.893 --> 12:42.093
we're beyond delighted
you could join us.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.065
"Beyond delighted"?

12:47.067 --> 12:49.934
What is that supposed to mean?
Like surprised?

12:49.936 --> 12:51.236
You think I wasn't
gonna show up?

12:51.238 --> 12:53.104
What do you take me for,
some kind of a jerk?

12:53.106 --> 12:55.273
Uh... um...

12:55.275 --> 12:56.908
No, I simply meant that--

12:56.910 --> 13:00.712
Or maybe you didn't think
I could get here.

13:00.714 --> 13:02.213
Corona's not the only place

13:02.215 --> 13:04.315
that has horse and carriages,
you know.

13:04.317 --> 13:07.218
Pittsford's got
those things in spades!

13:07.220 --> 13:09.320
Whoa!

13:09.322 --> 13:11.256
Insecure much, half-pint?

13:11.258 --> 13:14.125
-Rapunzel! Uh, I'm so sorry.
-(grumbling)

13:14.127 --> 13:15.894
-She's--
-Oh, that's our Rapunzel.

13:15.896 --> 13:17.495
Always quick with a joke.

13:17.497 --> 13:21.099
Why don't you go see
to getting this evening's
festivities rolling?

13:21.101 --> 13:22.967
Ugh. Whatever.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.970
Of course,
you must know that, um,

13:25.972 --> 13:27.739
"half-pint" is a, um...

13:27.741 --> 13:29.641
term of endearment
in Corona.

13:29.643 --> 13:33.311
You must have a half-pint
of liquid gold

13:33.313 --> 13:35.113
running through your veins.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.482
I knew that!
You think I didn't know that?

13:37.484 --> 13:39.684
What am I, uncultured?

13:49.429 --> 13:51.095
-(Rapunzel sighs)
-Announcer: And now...

13:51.097 --> 13:53.698
the event's
master of ceremonies,

13:53.700 --> 13:55.500
Eugene Fitzherbert!

13:55.502 --> 13:58.102
(applause)

14:09.649 --> 14:11.216
Ugh.

14:11.218 --> 14:13.218
Uh, ladies and gentlemen,

14:13.220 --> 14:16.387
let's get this peace party...

14:16.389 --> 14:18.423
started.

14:21.695 --> 14:24.696
So, um...
let me start again.

14:24.698 --> 14:26.231
Ladies and gent--

14:26.233 --> 14:27.599
(screams)

14:29.970 --> 14:31.336
You know what?

14:31.338 --> 14:34.472
I have had it
with this phony banquet!

14:34.474 --> 14:37.041
We are only doing this
to be nice to you, Griffin!

14:37.043 --> 14:38.843
But you need us!

14:38.845 --> 14:40.645
We don't need you!

14:41.581 --> 14:44.749
So, why don't you
just suck up your pride

14:44.751 --> 14:47.218
and accept Corona's help?

14:47.220 --> 14:50.255
(grumbling)

14:50.257 --> 14:52.023
(loud grumbling)

14:52.025 --> 14:53.191
(whinnies triumphantly)

14:53.193 --> 14:54.425
(squeaks)

15:07.674 --> 15:10.508
(all coughing)

15:17.717 --> 15:20.118
I think I feel normal again!

15:20.120 --> 15:22.620
-And so do I!
-No one cares how you feel.

15:22.622 --> 15:23.988
And so does she!

15:29.930 --> 15:32.830
-Win 'em back, Blondie!
-Yeah, do your thing, Raps.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.934
(sighs)
Thanks, guys.

15:36.970 --> 15:39.137
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:39.139 --> 15:41.105
have I got a funny story...

15:41.107 --> 15:43.241
Ah! Boo!

15:43.243 --> 15:45.276
Boo!

15:49.316 --> 15:50.481
Mom?

15:50.483 --> 15:52.550
(giggling)

15:54.921 --> 15:55.954
Ah!

15:55.956 --> 15:57.889
Oh, no!

15:57.891 --> 16:01.125
The vapor reversed
everyone's personalities!

16:01.127 --> 16:05.263
Corona's offer of partnership
was a mistake.

16:05.265 --> 16:08.466
It's time to show the world
the true power she wields!

16:08.468 --> 16:10.134
(gasps)

16:11.838 --> 16:14.272
So it comes to this...

16:14.274 --> 16:15.606
war!

16:15.608 --> 16:17.475
Wait a minute,
the counter-elixir

16:17.477 --> 16:19.410
reversed everybody's
personalities?

16:19.412 --> 16:22.146
(war cries)

16:22.148 --> 16:24.415
Dad, please!

16:24.417 --> 16:26.317
-(grunts)
-You're not thinking clearly.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.319
This is a huge mistake.

16:31.524 --> 16:32.690
Guards!

16:32.692 --> 16:35.159
Seize the princess
and her friends!

16:37.163 --> 16:38.863
Dad, no!

16:38.865 --> 16:40.365
Don't do this!

16:45.605 --> 16:47.839
This is all Max
and Pascal's fault.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.374
No,

16:49.376 --> 16:51.009
this is our fault.

16:51.011 --> 16:52.343
We've been jerks
to each other

16:52.345 --> 16:55.313
and Max and Pascal
were only trying to help.

16:55.315 --> 16:57.281
Look, guys,

16:57.283 --> 16:59.350
we are not perfect.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.886
Cass, you could show
a bit more compassion,

17:01.888 --> 17:04.322
and Eugene,
a dose of humility

17:04.324 --> 17:06.391
every now and then
wouldn't hurt.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.559
And maybe even I...

17:08.561 --> 17:11.362
don't have to be
so upbeat all the time.

17:11.364 --> 17:14.365
And I should be more frank
when I'm annoyed with things.

17:14.367 --> 17:17.201
My point is,
you guys are my best friends,

17:17.203 --> 17:20.405
and even though there are things
about us that annoy each other,

17:20.407 --> 17:23.808
I wouldn't trade them
for anything.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.877
Well, well.

17:25.879 --> 17:27.512
Glad to see
the schmaltz is back.

17:27.514 --> 17:30.381
(laughs)
And so is the cynicism.

17:32.018 --> 17:34.185
Now, there's one
characteristic

17:34.187 --> 17:36.387
we all have in common:

17:36.389 --> 17:38.856
we... don't... quit.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.425
And last time I checked,

17:40.427 --> 17:42.093
we have a war to stop.

17:42.095 --> 17:44.162
You heard her, Eugene.

17:44.164 --> 17:46.431
-Pick that lock!
-On it.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.434
Nabbed it while
getting arrested.

17:49.436 --> 17:52.103
Sure, that vapor may have turned
upstairs into utter chaos,

17:52.105 --> 17:53.671
but even in the darkest hour,

17:53.673 --> 17:56.240
a valiant and skilled
swashbuckler, such as myself,

17:56.242 --> 17:57.942
must keep his wits about him.

17:57.944 --> 18:00.111
So... you're welcome, ladies.

18:00.113 --> 18:02.013
Hmm?

18:02.015 --> 18:03.448
Humility.

18:03.450 --> 18:04.582
Right.

18:06.019 --> 18:07.085
(laughing)

18:07.087 --> 18:10.054
(indistinct chatter)

18:10.056 --> 18:11.355
(swords clang)

18:11.357 --> 18:14.192
Eugene,
charm the crowd to safety!

18:14.194 --> 18:16.194
Cass, handle the guards
and clear a path!

18:16.196 --> 18:18.062
I will go deal with my dad.

18:18.064 --> 18:20.264
Deep fried burgers
in the kitchen,

18:20.266 --> 18:22.467
and somehow,
they're zero calories.

18:22.469 --> 18:24.836
I think I saw someone
take off with your carriage.

18:26.306 --> 18:29.073
Follow me if you
want to see a duckling
who's friends with a kitty.

18:29.075 --> 18:31.476
Okay, everything I promised

18:31.478 --> 18:33.211
is magically outside this room

18:33.213 --> 18:34.545
containing this giant fight.

18:34.547 --> 18:36.781
That's it, keep coming.
Nothing to see there.

18:36.783 --> 18:37.815
This way, folks.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.317
-(grunts)
-(groans)

18:43.923 --> 18:45.890
Cassandra.

18:45.892 --> 18:47.091
Dad?

18:47.093 --> 18:50.161
Come on, I bet I'm better
at swords than you are.

18:51.731 --> 18:52.763
(grunts)

18:52.765 --> 18:54.832
I bet you I could
swing my...

18:54.834 --> 18:57.001
sword better than you!
I bet you!

18:58.071 --> 19:00.204
Ow! You're not playing fair!

19:04.911 --> 19:06.911
(groaning)

19:06.913 --> 19:08.980
Dad, no!

19:08.982 --> 19:10.915
Remember who you are,

19:10.917 --> 19:12.450
and what Corona stands for.

19:12.452 --> 19:15.319
You have to fight the potion.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.155
You can beat it!

19:18.191 --> 19:20.124
Please!

19:20.126 --> 19:22.527
Daughter,
I fear your free spirit

19:22.529 --> 19:25.530
and hopeless optimism
are a detriment to this
mighty kingdom.

19:25.532 --> 19:26.931
A queen cannot afford

19:26.933 --> 19:28.599
to show such sentimentality.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.040
(groaning)

19:36.042 --> 19:37.441
Stop it!

19:37.443 --> 19:38.342
That's not what you do!

19:38.344 --> 19:40.044
I'm gonna tell.

19:41.948 --> 19:43.047
(grunts)

19:46.553 --> 19:49.053
I knew letting you in
was a good idea.

19:51.291 --> 19:52.356
Don't you know

19:52.358 --> 19:53.658
children aren't supposed to play

19:53.660 --> 19:55.459
with sharp objects?

19:57.530 --> 19:58.663
(wailing)

19:58.665 --> 20:00.898
I'm not playing
with you anymore!

20:02.368 --> 20:04.402
Whew! Thanks for your help!

20:04.404 --> 20:06.504
Wait, why didn't your
personality change?

20:06.506 --> 20:08.206
What personality?

20:08.208 --> 20:11.709
(muttering)

20:13.680 --> 20:15.179
You're right, Dad.

20:15.181 --> 20:17.481
There is a time and place

20:17.483 --> 20:19.083
for sentimentality.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.590
And this is not one of them!

20:26.693 --> 20:29.193
If you are so sure
you are doing the right thing,

20:29.195 --> 20:31.329
then you should have
no problem

20:31.331 --> 20:33.698
going through your
free-spirit daughter

20:33.700 --> 20:35.466
to do it.

20:45.678 --> 20:48.379
I...
I'm sorry.

20:48.381 --> 20:50.581
Ah, come on!

20:50.583 --> 20:52.416
I wanna see a brawl!

20:52.418 --> 20:54.719
(muttering)

20:54.721 --> 20:56.420
-Aah!
-(crashes)

20:59.592 --> 21:00.725
Let this be the start

21:00.727 --> 21:03.060
of a centuries-long
friendship.

21:03.062 --> 21:06.631
I'm still not sure
what happened last night,

21:06.633 --> 21:09.467
but Rapunzel was right.

21:09.469 --> 21:12.536
I needed to swallow my pride
and accept help.

21:12.538 --> 21:14.639
Thank you, Princess.

21:17.577 --> 21:21.646
(Griffin blowing)

21:30.256 --> 21:33.291
Well, that wasn't how
I imagined things going.

21:33.293 --> 21:34.625
You said it.

21:34.627 --> 21:37.461
It's terrifying to think
something so small

21:37.463 --> 21:38.896
could have such an effect.

21:42.468 --> 21:44.402
Phew!

21:44.404 --> 21:46.504
Ugh. Good riddance.

21:49.575 --> 21:53.844
¶ ¶

21:57.517 --> 21:59.016
(clinks)

22:00.086 --> 22:01.652
Varian:
Wow.

22:01.654 --> 22:03.988
What do we have here?

22:07.293 --> 22:09.493
(theme music playing)

22:10.630 --> 22:13.698
¶ Now I got my eyes
opening wide ¶

22:13.700 --> 22:16.000
¶ My heart
burning like fire ¶

22:16.002 --> 22:18.502
¶ It feels like I'm so alive ¶

22:18.504 --> 22:20.438
¶ I'm never going back ¶

22:20.440 --> 22:23.207
¶ Whatever I want now,
I'm gonna chase ¶

22:23.209 --> 22:25.710
¶ Who I am,
I can't contain it ¶

22:25.712 --> 22:28.713
¶ I'm not gonna hold it in ¶

22:28.715 --> 22:30.815
¶ 'Cause there's
more of me to give ¶

22:30.817 --> 22:32.817
¶ Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh ¶

22:32.819 --> 22:34.018
¶ Oh, yeah ¶

22:34.020 --> 22:36.087
¶ There's more of me to give ¶
