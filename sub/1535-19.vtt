00:01.716 --> 00:04.317
Leonard, I've been working
on an opening joke

00:04.319 --> 00:05.859
for our lecture at Berkeley.

00:05.861 --> 00:07.030
Oh, I like to laugh.

00:07.032 --> 00:08.535
But say it anyway.

00:09.538 --> 00:11.475
Okay, um...

00:11.477 --> 00:14.142
What do you say
to a graduate

00:14.144 --> 00:16.416
of the UC Berkeley
physics department?

00:16.418 --> 00:19.018
I'll have fries with that.

00:19.989 --> 00:21.996
Because his education
hasn't prepared him

00:21.998 --> 00:23.862
for a career in the sciences.

00:26.033 --> 00:27.703
You know, when they chase
you out of there,

00:27.705 --> 00:29.400
you only have to run
faster than Sheldon.

00:30.140 --> 00:31.476
Are you all set
for your trip?

00:31.478 --> 00:32.812
Yeah, I think so.

00:32.814 --> 00:36.047
I just restocked the old PRK.

00:36.049 --> 00:37.088
"PRK"?

00:37.090 --> 00:38.584
Public restroom kit.

00:39.594 --> 00:42.327
Everything a boy needs
for making pee pee

00:42.329 --> 00:44.591
in new and strange places.

00:44.593 --> 00:47.031
I don't see what's crazy
about bringing a backpack

00:47.033 --> 00:49.366
with your own toilet paper
and Purell.

00:49.368 --> 00:51.465
Keep going.

00:51.467 --> 00:54.244
And rubber gloves,
uh, air freshener.

00:54.246 --> 00:56.846
Um, noise-cancelling
headphones.

00:56.848 --> 00:58.415
Oh, danger whistle.

00:58.417 --> 00:59.680
Um...

00:59.682 --> 01:00.985
pepper spray.

01:00.987 --> 01:03.955
Ooh, a multi-language
"occupied" sign.

01:03.957 --> 01:05.364
Uh, let's see.

01:05.366 --> 01:08.734
We have seat protectors,
uh, booties for my shoes,

01:08.736 --> 01:10.799
a clothespin for my nose.

01:10.801 --> 01:14.104
Oh, and a mirror on a stick,

01:14.106 --> 01:16.512
so I can make sure the person
in the stall next to me

01:16.514 --> 01:18.345
isn't some kind of weirdo.

01:21.051 --> 01:24.051
You still worried some Berkeley
girl is gonna steal him away?

01:24.053 --> 01:27.662
Yes, who do you think gave him
the danger whistle?

01:59.590 --> 02:02.198
Would you like to play
a physics car game I invented

02:02.200 --> 02:04.167
called "I Can't Spy"?

02:05.233 --> 02:07.502
It's all the nail-biting
tension of "I Spy"

02:07.504 --> 02:10.502
but the added fun of subatomic
particles and waves

02:10.503 --> 02:12.637
outside the visible
spectrum.

02:12.639 --> 02:14.205
If it's half as much fun as

02:14.207 --> 02:16.341
"One Times Ten to the Fourth
Bottles of Beer on the Wall,"

02:16.343 --> 02:18.014
I'm in.

02:18.016 --> 02:19.647
I'll begin.

02:19.649 --> 02:24.153
Uh, I can't spy
with my little eye...

02:25.291 --> 02:27.992
...something passing
right through us.

02:27.994 --> 02:29.656
That soy Frappuccino I had.

02:30.794 --> 02:32.663
Will you please
play the game?

02:32.665 --> 02:35.263
I can't spy
with my little eye

02:35.265 --> 02:37.295
something passing
right through us.

02:37.297 --> 02:39.367
I don't know, um...

02:39.369 --> 02:42.039
If 65 billion
solar neutrinos pass

02:42.041 --> 02:44.103
through a square centimeter
every second,

02:44.105 --> 02:46.144
given the surface
area of this car is

02:46.146 --> 02:48.041
about 60,000
square centimeters,

02:48.043 --> 02:52.787
that means 3.9 times ten
to the 15th solar neutrinos?

02:54.853 --> 02:57.354
I don't want
to play anymore.

02:58.356 --> 02:59.921
We haven't been on a road trip
in a while.

02:59.923 --> 03:01.121
This is fun.

03:01.123 --> 03:02.592
We get it... you won the game.

03:02.594 --> 03:04.393
Stop bragging.

03:04.395 --> 03:06.563
No, listen, we wrote
a paper together.

03:06.565 --> 03:08.299
Now we get to go to a university
and talk about it?

03:08.301 --> 03:09.803
That's pretty cool.

03:10.669 --> 03:12.506
I suppose it is.

03:12.508 --> 03:17.042
In fact, if you'd like to
celebrate with a little music,

03:17.044 --> 03:18.672
I'd be okay with that.

03:18.674 --> 03:21.508
What...?

03:22.772 --> 03:24.975
This road trip just got crazy.

03:25.935 --> 03:28.202
Play that funky music,
white boy.

03:30.105 --> 03:32.134
I'm surprised you know
that reference.

03:32.136 --> 03:35.036
What reference?

03:38.076 --> 03:41.036
So, I put stickers
on everything we're gonna sell.

03:41.038 --> 03:42.898
We just need help taking it
all out to the driveway.

03:42.900 --> 03:44.265
Can I be in charge
of pricing?

03:44.267 --> 03:46.769
I've been going to garage
sales my whole life.

03:46.771 --> 03:49.043
Can you believe I got these
pantyhose for a nickel?

03:50.646 --> 03:54.114
All right, Amy's in charge
of pricing and being 75.

03:55.683 --> 03:57.344
Hey, Penny, can you
give me a hand with this?

03:57.346 --> 03:58.449
Sure.

03:58.451 --> 04:00.049
Aw, we had one of
these growing up.

04:00.051 --> 04:01.520
I used to play
all the time.

04:01.522 --> 04:03.287
Oh, yeah?
I love Ping-Pong.

04:03.289 --> 04:05.517
Oh, I meant beer pong.

04:06.720 --> 04:08.254
I had a table, too,

04:08.256 --> 04:10.894
but I didn't have any friends,
so all I did was serve.

04:12.129 --> 04:14.569
You know, you can leave one
side up and play against it.

04:14.571 --> 04:17.476
And if I had a friend,
they might have told me that.

04:20.046 --> 04:21.740
Excuse me.

04:21.742 --> 04:23.907
Why is there a sticker on this?

04:23.909 --> 04:25.715
It's my TARDIS
from <i>Doctor Who.</i>

04:25.717 --> 04:27.748
I was planning on
moving it in the house.

04:27.750 --> 04:30.021
I think you just answered
your own question.

04:31.319 --> 04:33.989
Come on, one day,
this may double in value

04:33.991 --> 04:36.662
and be worth half
what I paid for it.

04:36.664 --> 04:38.294
Sweetie, we have a lot to do.

04:38.296 --> 04:40.094
We don't need
to decide this right now.

04:40.096 --> 04:43.068
Well, I guess as long as
you're keeping an open mind.

04:43.070 --> 04:44.933
Of course.

So... they're requesting

05:02.895 --> 05:06.198
that the white boy play
the funky music, yes?

05:06.200 --> 05:08.167
Yes.

05:08.169 --> 05:13.305
And this music we're listening
to right now is funky as well?

05:14.443 --> 05:16.480
Sure.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.143
Let me ask you this.

05:18.145 --> 05:19.614
Do you think

05:19.616 --> 05:24.247
this song is the music
the white boy ultimately plays?

05:26.090 --> 05:28.024
It could be.

05:28.026 --> 05:31.590
So it's like the musical
equivalent of Russell's Paradox,

05:31.592 --> 05:34.261
the question of whether
the set of all sets

05:34.263 --> 05:37.490
that don't contain themselves
as members contains itself?

05:37.492 --> 05:39.458
Exactly.
Well...

05:39.460 --> 05:40.761
then I hate it.

05:40.763 --> 05:42.065
Music should just be fun.

05:44.834 --> 05:46.494
Making great time.

05:46.496 --> 05:48.630
Gonna be there pretty early.

05:48.632 --> 05:50.270
Will our hotel room
be ready?

05:50.272 --> 05:51.636
I doubt it.

05:51.638 --> 05:54.235
Aren't you worried
that sitting in the lobby

05:54.237 --> 05:56.770
for a long period of time
might attract the attention

05:56.772 --> 05:59.504
of the hotel detective?

05:59.506 --> 06:01.135
If we do,

06:01.137 --> 06:04.805
we'll just tell him
to "hit the bricks, see?"

06:05.943 --> 06:09.184
Seems a little confrontational,
but all right.

06:10.418 --> 06:13.049
You know,
we won't be very far

06:13.051 --> 06:14.458
from Skywalker Ranch.

06:14.460 --> 06:16.322
Oh, that's true.

06:16.324 --> 06:18.226
It's not like
we can get in there.

06:18.228 --> 06:20.258
Why not?

06:20.260 --> 06:22.267
I-I don't think George Lucas
put his headquarters

06:22.269 --> 06:25.333
in the middle of nowhere because
he wanted people dropping in.

06:25.335 --> 06:29.604
Yoda's swamp was
in the middle of nowhere.

06:29.606 --> 06:31.772
Tatooine was in the middle
of nowhere.

06:31.774 --> 06:33.980
Hoth was in the middle
of nowhere.

06:35.510 --> 06:36.949
That's code, Leonard.

06:36.951 --> 06:39.150
He wants us
to drop in.

06:41.689 --> 06:42.918
We do have time.

06:42.920 --> 06:45.821
I mean, we could drive by
and just look at it.

06:45.823 --> 06:47.955
Yes! Oh...

06:47.957 --> 06:49.595
I'm so excited.

06:49.597 --> 06:51.994
And I just can't hide it.

06:51.996 --> 06:55.869
"I'm about to lose control,
and I think I like it."

06:57.808 --> 06:59.807
What are you
talking about?

07:05.514 --> 07:07.753
So when do you guys think
you're gonna move in?

07:07.755 --> 07:10.690
We're still figuring how much
remodeling we want to do.

07:10.692 --> 07:12.723
It's tricky finding
the right balance

07:12.725 --> 07:13.827
between "tasteful modern"

07:13.829 --> 07:16.690
and "Jewish mother
tchotchke crapfest."

07:17.660 --> 07:20.066
Have you made a decision
about the TARDIS?

07:20.068 --> 07:23.265
I think I can sell it if we call
it, "Big British Porta-Potty."

07:25.435 --> 07:28.304
We're not selling
it... it's mine.

07:28.306 --> 07:29.936
You can't just decide.

07:29.938 --> 07:31.775
How about I arm-wrestle you?

07:31.777 --> 07:33.143
That's not fair.

07:33.145 --> 07:37.047
It's like me challenging you
to a sexy pants contest.

07:38.448 --> 07:39.743
You could play
Ping-Pong for it.

07:39.745 --> 07:41.352
I would do that.

07:41.354 --> 07:42.281
How is that fair?

07:42.283 --> 07:43.586
You grew up
with a table.

07:43.588 --> 07:46.058
Yes, but I mostly used it
as a battlefield

07:46.060 --> 07:48.856
in an ongoing war between the
Transformers and the ThunderCats

07:48.858 --> 07:51.456
for control of a bra
I had found in the woods.

07:53.931 --> 07:55.602
Bernadette, for every episode
of <i>Doctor Who</i>

07:55.604 --> 07:56.930
Leonard has made me sit through,

07:56.932 --> 07:58.202
I will play on your behalf

07:58.204 --> 08:00.234
and send that TARDIS
back to Gallifrey,

08:00.236 --> 08:02.202
where I hate
that I know it belongs.

08:02.204 --> 08:04.808
Yes, Penny
plays for me.

08:04.810 --> 08:07.806
That's not fair...
She has upper body muscles.

08:09.376 --> 08:11.981
Dude, three-time

08:15.813 --> 08:17.714
That's right... okay,
Raj can play for me.

08:17.716 --> 08:19.450
Ooh, you just chose champions.

08:19.452 --> 08:21.417
It's like we're reenacting
the ancient German practice

08:21.419 --> 08:23.321
- of trial by combat.
- Yeah, it's also like

08:23.323 --> 08:25.690
when the Mountain fought the
Red Viper in <i>Game of Thrones.</i>

08:25.692 --> 08:27.458
Leonard makes you
watch that, too?

08:27.460 --> 08:28.994
No, no, I like that show.

08:28.996 --> 08:30.826
It's got dragons
and people doing it.

08:31.763 --> 08:33.128
So it's settled.

08:33.130 --> 08:35.697
The fate of Doctor Who's TARDIS
will be decided

08:35.698 --> 08:38.232
by a <i>Game of Thrones </i> inspired
death-match on the battlefield

08:38.234 --> 08:41.336
of ThunderCats
versus Transformers.

08:41.337 --> 08:44.640
If you still have that bra,
I'll give you a nickel for it.

08:50.346 --> 08:53.708
There it is.

08:53.710 --> 08:56.683
It's just a gate.

08:56.685 --> 08:59.681
On a road.

08:59.683 --> 09:01.849
Wasn't even that
hard to find.

09:04.723 --> 09:06.017
This is so amazing!

09:06.019 --> 09:07.889
I know!

09:08.923 --> 09:10.457
You want to
get a picture?

09:10.459 --> 09:11.992
I want more than a picture.

09:11.994 --> 09:13.256
I want to go in.

09:13.258 --> 09:14.960
Well, so do I, but
they'll never let us.

09:14.962 --> 09:18.432
Is that the attitude
that helped you get Penny?

09:18.434 --> 09:20.303
No, but I don't have three years

09:20.305 --> 09:22.638
to make that gate
feel sorry for me.

09:24.505 --> 09:26.502
Uh, there's
a speaker box.

09:26.504 --> 09:30.006
Drive up, push the button,
and let's see what happens.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.477
Okay, yeah.

09:32.479 --> 09:35.108
What do we
have to lose?

09:42.920 --> 09:44.524
I'm a little nervous.

09:44.526 --> 09:47.157
Well, get over it.

09:47.159 --> 09:49.830
Confidence is key
in these situations.

09:49.832 --> 09:51.695
Right.

09:52.834 --> 09:55.370
You pushed it...
Are you out of your mind?!

09:56.709 --> 09:57.875
May I help you?

09:57.877 --> 09:58.939
Um...

09:58.941 --> 10:01.148
Uh, uh... we don't
have an appointment,

10:01.150 --> 10:02.381
and-and we don't
belong here,

10:02.383 --> 10:04.685
but we-we're, like,
crazy-big fans.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.252
I mean...

10:06.254 --> 10:08.387
"crazy for <i>Star</i>

10:08.389 --> 10:11.354
not crazy like we have a

10:27.000 --> 10:28.903
This speaker's not working,
just pull up.

10:33.641 --> 10:35.543
And that's how it's done.

10:47.500 --> 10:51.599
All right, we've defeated
the first challenge.

10:52.969 --> 10:55.671
Now we must steel ourselves
to face the monster

10:55.673 --> 10:57.935
who defends the gate.

10:57.937 --> 11:00.503
We're trying to get past
a security guard,

11:00.505 --> 11:02.374
not rescue Zelda.

11:03.878 --> 11:06.579
I think what really needs to be
rescued is your sense of whimsy,

11:06.581 --> 11:08.579
but one quest at a time.

11:10.517 --> 11:12.250
So what's the plan?

11:12.252 --> 11:14.546
Uh, I'm just gonna be honest
with the guy.

11:14.548 --> 11:16.921
Honesty will never
get us in.

11:16.923 --> 11:18.554
Well, what's
your plan?

11:18.556 --> 11:21.924
All right, my plan is
predicated on the assumption

11:21.926 --> 11:23.892
that they have
a nurse's office

11:23.894 --> 11:26.764
and your willingness
to be lightly stabbed.

11:34.710 --> 11:36.205
Who are you here to see?

11:36.207 --> 11:37.774
Uh, I'm just gonna
tell you the truth.

11:37.776 --> 11:40.310
Oh, you are killing me.

11:40.312 --> 11:42.350
We don't have
an appointment.

11:42.352 --> 11:44.350
We-we're just fans
of Mr. Lucas's work,

11:44.352 --> 11:45.615
and we thought
we'd take a shot

11:45.617 --> 11:47.654
and see if we could get in
and look around.

11:47.656 --> 11:49.086
Sorry, guys, we get this a lot.

11:49.088 --> 11:50.189
Can't let you in.

11:50.191 --> 11:54.089
What if I told you
that I was the voice of Yoda?

11:55.195 --> 11:59.295
A recording
session I must attend.

12:00.097 --> 12:01.988
I'm sorry, don't
listen to him.

12:01.990 --> 12:03.692
We're actually
physicists.

12:03.694 --> 12:05.594
We're giving a lecture
at Berkeley later today.

12:05.596 --> 12:07.594
We just... we had
some time to kill.

12:07.596 --> 12:09.865
Hey, listen, you
seem like decent guys.

12:09.867 --> 12:11.160
I can't let you in,

12:11.162 --> 12:13.695
but I got some hats and T-shirts
I can give you.

12:13.697 --> 12:15.566
Thank you so much.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.134
See?

12:17.136 --> 12:18.439
Maybe honesty is the best...

12:18.441 --> 12:19.439
What are you doing?

12:19.441 --> 12:21.102
Shedding the yoke
of my oppressors,

12:21.104 --> 12:23.310
you blind,
sad little man.

12:24.143 --> 12:25.478
Don't move!

12:25.480 --> 12:27.510
Code A-A-23, A-A-23.

12:27.512 --> 12:28.878
Copy.

12:28.880 --> 12:31.013
I can see the ranch, Leonard!

12:31.015 --> 12:33.580
Oh, it's rustic,
it's lovely.

12:33.582 --> 12:36.419
I'd take a picture,
but people are chasing me.

12:37.957 --> 12:39.282
I'm gonna make it...!

12:39.284 --> 12:40.585
I'm gonna make it!

12:40.587 --> 12:42.919
They have Tasers,
but they wouldn't dare use...

12:46.959 --> 12:49.421
Come on, Raj.

12:49.423 --> 12:53.125
You are the King Kong
of Ping-Pong.

12:53.127 --> 12:56.899
You are the menace
of table tennis.

12:56.901 --> 13:00.001
Put her away,
'cause I don't have a third one.

13:00.003 --> 13:01.768
Yes!
Yes!

13:02.738 --> 13:05.232
Rajesh eight, Penny four.

13:05.234 --> 13:07.202
Sorry,
he's really good.

13:07.204 --> 13:09.335
Hey, Raj.

13:09.337 --> 13:10.504
If Howard can't
keep the TARDIS,

13:10.506 --> 13:12.206
how great would it
look at your place?

13:12.208 --> 13:13.237
What?

13:13.239 --> 13:14.676
Yeah, what?

13:14.678 --> 13:17.104
I don't know much
about <i>Doctor Who,</i>

13:17.106 --> 13:19.004
but if, um, you were to put this

13:19.006 --> 13:23.037
right outside your front door
and open up the back,

13:23.039 --> 13:26.066
it would be like
your entire apartment was

13:26.068 --> 13:27.833
the inside of the TARDIS,

13:27.835 --> 13:29.569
which is pretty cool

13:29.571 --> 13:31.901
'cause on the show,
the inside of the TARDIS

13:31.903 --> 13:34.835
is bigger than the outside.

13:34.837 --> 13:38.759
But then again, I don't know
much about <i>Doctor Who.</i>

13:39.928 --> 13:41.597
Don't listen to her.

13:41.599 --> 13:44.332
You and I go way back...
We're like brothers.

13:45.165 --> 13:46.835
We are. We are.

13:48.132 --> 13:50.066
Oh, no!

13:50.068 --> 13:51.465
What a terrible serve!

13:53.541 --> 13:55.007
Sorry, brother.

13:55.009 --> 13:56.372
Eight-five.
This is ridiculous.

13:56.374 --> 13:57.634
I want a new champion.

13:57.636 --> 14:00.399
Amy, were you serious
about being able to serve?

14:00.401 --> 14:02.733
Uh, it-it's been
a long time.

14:02.735 --> 14:04.700
I don't know.

14:04.702 --> 14:06.637
I'm probably
pretty rusty.

14:10.142 --> 14:11.444
Wow.

14:11.446 --> 14:12.476
She's my champion!

14:12.478 --> 14:14.515
Well, if you can switch
champions, so can I.

14:14.517 --> 14:15.916
I want Raj.
Hey.

14:15.918 --> 14:17.780
Oh, come on, like
you even care.

14:17.782 --> 14:19.117
I care!

14:19.119 --> 14:20.957
Oh, wait, no, I don't.
Good luck, Raj.

14:23.456 --> 14:25.536
You know, I thought our
friendship meant more to you.

14:26.264 --> 14:27.925
So did I.

14:35.667 --> 14:37.936
Do you think
they're gonna call the police?

14:37.938 --> 14:39.865
I don't know.

14:39.867 --> 14:42.168
Maybe they'll call Imperial
Officers to take us

14:42.170 --> 14:44.440
to a holding cell
on the Death Star.

14:47.242 --> 14:50.544
Oh, I think that's below the pay
grade of an Imperial Officer.

14:50.546 --> 14:51.911
Stormtroopers are really
the ones who...

14:51.913 --> 14:53.543
Oh, shut up.

14:54.552 --> 14:56.350
He's right.

14:56.352 --> 14:58.454
Uh, Stormtroopers actually
combine both the function

14:58.456 --> 15:00.620
of infantry and military police.

15:02.820 --> 15:04.817
Uh-huh, I'm normally
very nice,

15:04.819 --> 15:06.552
but you shut up, too.

15:13.296 --> 15:14.789
So...

15:14.791 --> 15:17.596
what are you in for?

15:17.598 --> 15:21.266
Honestly, I just wanted to meet
Mr. Lucas and say thank you.

15:21.268 --> 15:24.762
You know, growing up, the movies
had such an impact on my life.

15:24.764 --> 15:27.067
I never really fit in anywhere.

15:27.069 --> 15:29.107
Till I discovered
the worlds he created

15:29.109 --> 15:31.905
and finally found a place
where I belong.

15:33.106 --> 15:35.207
But why are you here?

15:35.209 --> 15:36.839
Oh, I, uh, I hopped a fence,

15:36.841 --> 15:38.510
and they caught me
in the sculpture gallery

15:38.512 --> 15:41.276
making out
with a Chewbacca statue.

15:47.343 --> 15:48.875
Excuse me.

15:57.148 --> 15:59.050
Leonard,

15:59.052 --> 16:01.321
they have a
sculpture gallery.

16:05.425 --> 16:07.687
All right, I talked
to my supervisor,

16:07.689 --> 16:08.895
and we're gonna let you go
with a warning.

16:08.897 --> 16:10.696
But if you ever
come back,

16:10.698 --> 16:12.360
we will call the police
and press charges.

16:12.362 --> 16:13.360
We understand.

16:13.362 --> 16:14.328
Thank you so much.

16:14.330 --> 16:15.935
Uh, what about me?

16:15.937 --> 16:17.366
No, you're not going
anywhere, kissy face.

16:17.368 --> 16:18.934
Let's go.

16:18.936 --> 16:22.037
I have to take your picture
to post at the guard gate.

16:22.039 --> 16:23.005
Uh, one question

16:23.007 --> 16:24.500
about that picture.

16:24.502 --> 16:26.307
Can it be with
George Lucas?

16:27.973 --> 16:30.107
Ooh, grumpy you are.

16:35.051 --> 16:38.082
Okay, this is the match
that decides it all.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.355
First to 11 wins.

16:39.357 --> 16:42.186
Serve switches
every five points.

16:42.188 --> 16:43.723
And just so you know,
when this started,

16:43.725 --> 16:46.492
I was going to put the TARDIS in
a discreet corner of the house,

16:46.494 --> 16:48.028
but I've since turned
mean, and now it's going

16:48.030 --> 16:49.531
right in the middle
of the living room

16:49.533 --> 16:51.298
on a rotating platform with
a sign that says "suck it."

16:51.300 --> 16:52.466
Game on.

16:54.867 --> 16:56.169
Except...

16:56.171 --> 16:58.537
Raj is gonna win.

16:58.539 --> 16:59.832
Isn't that right, Raj?

16:59.834 --> 17:02.302
Uh, yeah, I mean,
her serve was pretty good.

17:02.304 --> 17:03.836
Come on, get
in her head.

17:03.838 --> 17:05.002
Be intimidating.

17:05.003 --> 17:07.034
Okay, uh...

17:07.036 --> 17:08.201
I'm gonna own you, bitch!

17:08.203 --> 17:09.872
Whoa!
Hey!

17:09.874 --> 17:11.376
That's not nice.

17:12.642 --> 17:14.280
Let's just play.

17:18.281 --> 17:19.584
One-zero.

17:19.586 --> 17:21.152
Two.

17:21.154 --> 17:22.817
Three.

17:22.819 --> 17:24.686
Four.

17:24.689 --> 17:26.487
Five-nothing.

17:26.489 --> 17:27.887
Wait,

17:27.888 --> 17:29.223
did you play badminton

17:29.225 --> 17:31.863
or sad-minton?

17:31.865 --> 17:33.862
Don't listen to him...
All she's got is a serve.

17:33.864 --> 17:37.334
Now, grab a fresh tampon
and put her away.

17:37.336 --> 17:38.334
Wha...?

17:38.336 --> 17:39.832
A-And that's not offensive?

17:39.834 --> 17:40.874
Where's the line?

17:40.876 --> 17:43.010
It's in your purse. Play.

17:45.213 --> 17:46.916
One-five.

17:48.382 --> 17:49.884
Two-five.

17:49.886 --> 17:51.019
Three-five.

17:51.021 --> 17:52.682
Four-five.

17:53.652 --> 17:54.881
Five-five!

17:56.555 --> 17:58.154
Six.

17:58.156 --> 17:59.458
Seven.

17:59.460 --> 18:01.322
Eight. Nine.

18:01.892 --> 18:04.394
Ten-five!

18:05.701 --> 18:07.836
Six.

18:09.974 --> 18:11.741
Seven.

18:11.743 --> 18:13.445
Eight.

18:13.447 --> 18:15.412
Nine.

18:15.414 --> 18:18.443
Ten-ten!

18:20.813 --> 18:23.377
Well, that was
an exciting 40 seconds.

18:24.515 --> 18:26.784
It was, and now
the serve is back to you,

18:26.786 --> 18:28.552
and the game is over.

18:30.090 --> 18:32.792
You know, Amy,
I, uh...

18:32.794 --> 18:34.760
can't help but wonder
how Sheldon would react

18:34.762 --> 18:36.960
if the TARDIS was
at your place.

18:37.930 --> 18:39.961
Don't listen to her,
just hit the ball.

18:40.803 --> 18:42.330
Keep talking.

18:46.076 --> 18:48.906
If this doesn't get him
into your bedroom,

18:48.908 --> 18:50.578
nothing will.

18:56.988 --> 18:58.450
Are you still
mad at me?

18:58.452 --> 19:02.125
Yes, we missed our lecture,
we were almost arrested,

19:02.127 --> 19:04.126
and you got me locked
in a room with a man

19:04.128 --> 19:08.630
who forced his tongue down the
throat of a stuffed Wookiee.

19:09.735 --> 19:11.997
Boy, some people are just
glass-half-empty.

19:12.768 --> 19:14.534
The glass is
empty, Sheldon.

19:14.536 --> 19:15.774
It's completely empty.

19:15.776 --> 19:17.773
If you gave that glass to a
man who was dying of thirst,

19:17.775 --> 19:19.805
he would be dead,
do you know why?

19:19.807 --> 19:22.909
Before I answer,
was he a smoker?

19:27.653 --> 19:29.683
I think you're looking
at this all wrong.

19:29.685 --> 19:32.282
Fine, then tell me
how I should be looking at it.

19:32.284 --> 19:36.586
Well, not only did we go to
Skywalker Ranch, we got in.

19:36.588 --> 19:38.889
No one we know
can say that.

19:38.891 --> 19:42.226
And for all the times
you find me irritating,

19:42.228 --> 19:45.500
today you got to watch
someone shoot me with a Taser.

19:48.743 --> 19:51.475
That part was pretty good.

19:51.477 --> 19:53.170
See?

19:53.172 --> 19:56.145
You did flop around a lot.

19:56.147 --> 19:58.411
I'll take your word for it.

19:58.413 --> 20:01.517
I was too busy
trying not to defecate.

20:03.352 --> 20:05.686
You know, when they were
escorting us

20:05.688 --> 20:08.925
to the detaining room,
I looked through a door,

20:08.927 --> 20:10.893
and I'm pretty sure
I saw a display case

20:10.895 --> 20:12.828
with the Ark
of the Covenant.

20:12.830 --> 20:15.163
That's amazing.
I know.

20:15.165 --> 20:18.435
And I saw Jabba the Hutt
riding by on a motorcycle.

20:18.437 --> 20:20.835
Although that was
right after the Tasing,

20:20.837 --> 20:22.908
so who can
say for sure?

20:24.406 --> 20:27.170
I-I guess this could count
as an adventure.

20:27.172 --> 20:28.442
It was.

20:28.444 --> 20:31.073
And even though we're
not allowed back there,

20:31.075 --> 20:33.378
they can never take
today away from us.

20:34.084 --> 20:36.112
Unlike my sense
of smell,

20:36.114 --> 20:38.679
which hasn't returned
since the Tasing.

20:41.319 --> 20:42.853
No, I got nothing.

20:51.975 --> 20:55.340
Amy, the Daleks
are right on my tail!

20:55.342 --> 20:57.677
Quick, we need to reset
the time circuits.

20:57.679 --> 21:00.846
Oh, no, I left my sonic
screwdriver behind.

21:05.578 --> 21:07.138
Really should have
thought this through.
