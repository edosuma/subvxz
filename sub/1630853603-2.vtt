I discovered a large

the hole with napkins

17:50.390 --> 17:52.393

17:52.426 --> 17:54.128
Shoulda stopped by
to break your legs,

17:54.161 --> 17:56.196
but, you know,
I guess I'm becoming forgetful.

17:59.199 --> 18:01.735
Why'd you give him the money?

18:01.768 --> 18:03.237
Very good question.

18:03.270 --> 18:05.005
You know, I, uh...

18:05.038 --> 18:06.874
I don't know. He said he was
gonna franchise the place,

18:06.907 --> 18:09.143
but you knew that
was bullshit.

18:09.176 --> 18:11.111
You still gave it to him.

18:12.179 --> 18:14.214
I loved him, too.

Look...

18:19.386 --> 18:21.422

the easy thing here,

18:21.455 --> 18:23.356
and you sell it to me.

No.

are bad for business.

the money, Jimmy.

-Because he's good.
-(sighs) Oh my god...

18:53.153 --> 18:56.023

like it or not,
he's incredibly talented,

18:56.056 --> 18:57.658
and we could all learn
a lot from him.

could be good.

19:28.155 --> 19:29.056

a little aggressive,

keep calling me?

19:48.308 --> 19:49.976

19:56.149 --> 19:57.818
Well...

19:57.851 --> 19:59.954
I'd be crying, too.
She's at this different school,

19:59.987 --> 20:02.189

a bunch of fuckfaces.

20:03.991 --> 20:05.726
