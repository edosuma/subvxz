00:10.130 --> 00:11.670
Brock!

00:13.880 --> 00:15.300
Aah! Oh!

00:22.560 --> 00:24.100
Ow!

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073

00:34.570 --> 00:35.650
Rusty?

00:43.710 --> 00:44.710
Nobody move!

00:44.830 --> 00:45.910
I'll get it!

00:49.130 --> 00:51.380
Colonel Fun has arrived!

00:51.500 --> 00:53.210
Ah, you read my mind.

00:53.340 --> 00:55.630
I need a stiff one
in me after that car ride.

00:55.760 --> 00:57.680
Why, was I too fast for you, Horace?

00:57.800 --> 01:00.390
Never let a woman
drive your Aston, Jonesie.

01:00.510 --> 01:02.560
This one handles a stick
like it's got herpes.

01:02.680 --> 01:06.060
Well, who knows,
with all the strange garages you park it in.

01:06.190 --> 01:07.100
Hello, Dr. Venture.

01:07.230 --> 01:08.690
Ms. Quymn.

01:08.810 --> 01:10.610
More like,
Ms. Bullocks-buster.

01:10.730 --> 01:11.820
If she won't take my name...

01:11.940 --> 01:14.780
maybe she'll take
a smack in her smart mouth.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.070
Try me.

01:16.200 --> 01:19.160
Mom, are you and Horace
quarrelling again?

01:19.280 --> 01:20.950
No, Tara.

01:21.080 --> 01:22.990
Oh, hello, Sunshine.

01:23.120 --> 01:24.290
Got your nose.

01:26.660 --> 01:27.620
Kano!

01:27.750 --> 01:29.370
Take Tara downstairs, would you?

01:31.420 --> 01:33.710
Go with the nice Chinaman, Tara, doll.

01:33.840 --> 01:37.340
Ahem.
Where do we, you know?

01:37.470 --> 01:39.470
H.E.L.P.eR.!

01:42.680 --> 01:45.060
Oh, you pretty thing.

01:46.100 --> 01:47.940
Just a little further...

01:48.060 --> 01:50.770
and we'll reach
the Lost City of Gold, Sabu.

01:50.900 --> 01:55.280
Save me, oh, save me, Dr. Venture!

01:55.400 --> 01:57.150
Dr. Quymn, I presume?

01:57.280 --> 01:59.780
Kano, we're out of ice!

02:00.780 --> 02:04.280
This time, I get to save you
from the savages!

02:09.960 --> 02:11.170
Dr. Quymn, I presume.

02:11.290 --> 02:13.040
Gently.
I sucked the poison out...

02:13.170 --> 02:14.710
but you were completely dehydrated.

02:14.840 --> 02:17.550
What were you thinking
running about in the jungle in--

02:17.670 --> 02:18.840
what is this, polyester?

02:18.970 --> 02:22.140
"Humidity is no excuse
for wrinkles, Rusty."

02:22.260 --> 02:24.260
Pity your father also
didn't teach you not to steal...

02:24.390 --> 02:26.430
fertility idols from irritable head-hunters.

02:26.560 --> 02:27.980
Oh, that.

02:28.100 --> 02:31.440
I've been researching
alternative cures for impotence.

02:31.560 --> 02:32.600
Oh, not for me, of course.

02:32.730 --> 02:33.730
Have you not tried Viagra?

02:33.860 --> 02:34.770
It gives me--

02:34.900 --> 02:38.360
my customers headaches,
nausea, dyspepsia, and/or diarrhoea.

02:38.490 --> 02:39.860
But enough shop talk.

02:39.990 --> 02:41.530
How've you been?

02:41.660 --> 02:44.070
What are you doing
way out here in the middle of nowhere?

02:44.200 --> 02:46.910
Oh, you know, "curing cancer."

02:47.040 --> 02:49.160
- Ah.
- Well, I'm trying, anyway.

02:49.290 --> 02:50.960
There've been a number of...

02:51.080 --> 02:52.170
obstacles.

02:52.290 --> 02:53.750
Mother, is your friend all right?

02:53.880 --> 02:55.000
Yes, my darlings.

02:55.130 --> 02:56.840
Come and meet Dr. Venture.

02:56.960 --> 03:00.220
These are my daughters,
Nancy and Drew.

03:00.340 --> 03:02.510
- Hello, Dr. Venture.
- Pleased to meet you, sir.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.510
Ah, hello, ladies, hello.

03:04.640 --> 03:05.890
So, children.

03:06.010 --> 03:06.930
The father must be--

03:07.060 --> 03:08.310
I'm back.

03:08.430 --> 03:10.100
Finally caught that son of a bitch...

03:10.230 --> 03:11.940
who's been sniffing around the campsite.

03:12.060 --> 03:13.150
Big mo-fo, too.

03:13.270 --> 03:14.230
Ew! Oh!

03:14.360 --> 03:16.230
Rusty, this is Ginny...

03:16.360 --> 03:19.320
my bodyguard and
"right-hand man," as it were.

03:19.440 --> 03:20.440
Oh, hello.

03:20.570 --> 03:21.530
I'm Dr. V--

03:21.650 --> 03:22.910
Ginny's a yank.

03:23.030 --> 03:24.070
Just like you.

03:24.200 --> 03:25.120
Not like him.

03:25.240 --> 03:26.740
Ungh!

03:26.870 --> 03:28.200
Well, really should be getti--

03:28.330 --> 03:29.910
Oh, my god!

03:32.210 --> 03:33.370
I'll just carry them.

03:33.500 --> 03:34.710
Oh, poo.

03:34.830 --> 03:37.840
Are you sure you can't stay
just a while longer, Rusty?

03:37.960 --> 03:40.090
- Yes, won't you?
- Oh, do stay!

03:40.220 --> 03:42.170
- They remind me of my boys.
- Please, pretty please!

03:42.300 --> 03:45.640
They get really excited
about everything, too.

03:45.760 --> 03:48.140
Bang, Clyde.
Aw.

03:48.260 --> 03:50.060
Hey, enough with that already, Hank.

03:50.180 --> 03:52.980
We're supposed to teach him
boxing, not tricks.

03:53.100 --> 03:54.650
- You ready, Dean?
- No.

03:54.770 --> 03:56.980
Brock, this is kind
of the saddest thing ever.

03:57.110 --> 03:58.770
- Bang, Clyde.
- Stop it, Hank.

03:58.900 --> 03:59.820
Yeah, it is, Dean.

03:59.940 --> 04:02.190
But your pop says
we need the money, OK?

04:02.320 --> 04:03.950
Now, fight!

04:05.910 --> 04:07.660
Bang, Clyde.

04:07.780 --> 04:09.450
Ow! Clyde!

04:09.580 --> 04:11.450
Freeze, poachers!

04:11.580 --> 04:13.000
Whoa, easy, lady.

04:13.120 --> 04:14.370
Wait, don't!

04:14.500 --> 04:15.620
They're with me!

04:15.750 --> 04:18.459
Your fancy new pal's got
a nice little side line...

04:18.589 --> 04:21.209
selling apes
on the black market, Tara.

04:21.339 --> 04:22.840
- Oh, Rusty, really?
- No!

04:22.970 --> 04:25.340
- No, this isn't how it looks.
- Yeah, it is.

04:25.470 --> 04:27.050
Mummy. What's going on?

04:27.180 --> 04:28.140
Who are they?

04:28.260 --> 04:31.100
We were in Thailand just last week...

04:31.220 --> 04:35.480
and we came across
this tragic little fella in a cage.

04:35.600 --> 04:36.980
Terrible, terrible...

04:37.110 --> 04:39.150
Hank? Hank?

04:39.270 --> 04:40.320
Do you feel cold?

04:40.440 --> 04:41.530
Is your skin tingling?

04:41.650 --> 04:43.780
...and so we had to rescue the little guy.

04:43.900 --> 04:46.410
Rigor. First symptoms
of malaria, I think.

04:46.530 --> 04:49.030
...reintroduce him to the wild.

04:49.160 --> 04:50.160
Slowly.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.450
In fact, hell, he looks ready to me.

04:52.580 --> 04:54.000
What do you think, Brock?

04:54.120 --> 04:56.580
Huh?
Uh-huh. Oh, oh, yeah, sure.

04:56.710 --> 04:58.210
Sure, Dr. Venture.

04:59.670 --> 05:02.670
See, feral instincts taking over already.

05:02.800 --> 05:03.960
He's cured!

05:04.970 --> 05:07.760
Yeah, we had a bit of a fling years ago.

05:07.890 --> 05:10.510
Ah, she's one of those
bleeding hearts, save-the-world types.

05:10.640 --> 05:13.890
So, no more teaching chimps to box, huh?

05:14.020 --> 05:16.770
By the way,
thanks for that new personal low.

05:16.890 --> 05:19.440
I like to mix it up,
keep you on your toes.

05:19.560 --> 05:21.060
Speaking of which, new mission.

05:21.190 --> 05:23.480
Operation "Do Rusty a Solid."

05:23.610 --> 05:26.320
I need you to keep
this Jimmy character distracted.

05:26.450 --> 05:28.490
- Who?
- The bodyguard, what's his name.

05:28.610 --> 05:29.950
- Who, Ginny?
- Yeah, him.

05:30.070 --> 05:32.990
So, you two are identical twins?

05:33.120 --> 05:35.500
Semi-identical, technically.

05:35.620 --> 05:37.160
We just look lots alike.

05:37.290 --> 05:39.170
Our own mum
can't tell us apart sometimes.

05:40.380 --> 05:41.630
My dad's the same way with us.

05:41.750 --> 05:43.710
Say, what do you gals do for fun?

05:43.840 --> 05:48.300
Oh, well, back home we
usually like to solve mysteries.

05:48.430 --> 05:49.380
Hey, me, too.

05:49.510 --> 05:51.010
I'm more the adventuring type.

05:51.140 --> 05:53.220
Oh, we go on adventures, as well!

05:53.350 --> 05:54.390
Fight mummies...

05:54.520 --> 05:56.730
You know how it is,
mystery leads to museum...

05:56.850 --> 05:58.060
museum leads to mummy...

05:58.190 --> 06:00.480
and Bob's your uncle,
there we are, right in the thick of it.

06:01.690 --> 06:02.690
I can bench-press.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.690
I think he's kind of got a thing for her...

06:04.820 --> 06:07.740
and, well, frankly,
he's a bit of a wet blanket.

06:07.860 --> 06:10.910
The only wet blankets
I'm interested in are the ones--

06:11.030 --> 06:12.910
All right, I know where this is going.

06:13.030 --> 06:14.280
You know, when we're sweating--

06:14.410 --> 06:15.790
- Yes!
- Rolling around.

06:15.910 --> 06:18.040
- Yes!
- When we're having--

06:18.160 --> 06:19.500
OK, Doc, I get it!

06:19.620 --> 06:20.710
All right.

06:20.830 --> 06:25.710
Just making sure
we're all on the same page here.

06:25.840 --> 06:26.800
Sex.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.920
Son of a friggin' bitch!

06:31.760 --> 06:33.640
Stay close.

06:33.760 --> 06:36.140
Natives are real suspicious of outsiders...

06:36.270 --> 06:38.520
ever since that IKEA
opened up downriver.

06:38.640 --> 06:40.690
The logging company
that supplies the lumber...

06:40.810 --> 06:42.900
for their Billy bookcases
has been trying...

06:43.020 --> 06:44.900
to force them off their ancestral lands.

06:48.570 --> 06:50.820
He says it struck again last night.

06:52.530 --> 06:53.490
The Were-o-dile.

06:53.620 --> 06:54.950
Were-o-dile?!

06:55.080 --> 06:56.450
Local folk legend.

06:56.580 --> 06:58.450
Half man, half crocodile.

06:58.580 --> 07:00.500
And covered in awful hair.

07:01.580 --> 07:04.710
He says it tore the head off
their mightiest warrior.

07:04.840 --> 07:09.130
He says it was as if someone
shook up a six-foot can of...

07:10.130 --> 07:12.130
blood soda...

07:12.260 --> 07:13.970
and somebody popped the top.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.260
Poosh!

07:16.760 --> 07:18.390
By day, it's an ordinary person.

07:18.520 --> 07:21.310
But when the moon is full
and the Were-o-dile's spirit...

07:21.440 --> 07:24.230
is displeased, it seeks
vengeance upon the tribe.

07:26.770 --> 07:28.480
He says it's your fault...

07:28.610 --> 07:30.690
that you brought
the wrath of the Were-o-dile...

07:30.820 --> 07:32.530
when you stole their idol.

07:32.660 --> 07:33.660
Nice.

07:34.660 --> 07:37.030
Oh, it's a sweetheart deal all around.

07:37.160 --> 07:39.410
We don't even have to
flip a coin, 'cause they're identical.

07:39.540 --> 07:42.330
Semi-identical. Means they're
monozygotic but developed different.

07:42.460 --> 07:44.080
Listen to
the lady-killer on this one.

07:44.210 --> 07:46.500
You have got to
super-stop it with that egghead crud.

07:46.630 --> 07:48.880
Drew's got a freckle on her nose.
So, you can tell them apart.

07:49.010 --> 07:50.210
Frith help us.

07:50.340 --> 07:51.840
Play it cool, Dean-o.

07:51.970 --> 07:53.720
Step to them with that line, they'll think...

07:53.840 --> 07:56.340
you're some some
crazy obsessed weirdo stalker who, like...

07:56.470 --> 07:57.970
draws pictures of them
in your notebook.

07:58.100 --> 07:59.600
They're for the Venture Home news.

07:59.720 --> 08:01.600
Pictures increase circulation.

08:01.730 --> 08:03.770
And they'll think you,
like, talk to the pictures.

08:03.900 --> 08:07.020
And then you cut out the lips
and the eyes with, like, a razor blade...

08:07.150 --> 08:09.440
and then you write dirty words
on them with your own poop...

08:09.570 --> 08:10.730
and you rub them on your chest.

08:10.860 --> 08:11.820
What-- where did--

08:11.940 --> 08:12.860
C.S.I.

08:12.990 --> 08:15.320
Well, I'm not interested in
playing it anything.

08:15.450 --> 08:16.490
I like them.

08:16.620 --> 08:18.280
I just don't like them like them.

08:18.410 --> 08:19.660
- Well, I do.
- Which one?

08:19.790 --> 08:21.660
I don't know.
Either one. Whatever.

08:22.660 --> 08:23.660
I like Dean.

08:23.790 --> 08:27.420
He's got that hot little
Iggy Pop body but with, like...

08:27.540 --> 08:28.790
a Weezer sort of style.

08:28.920 --> 08:30.920
You little scammer-jammer!

08:31.050 --> 08:32.760
I told you I like Dean!

08:32.880 --> 08:34.340
- Go for Hank.
- Ew, no.

08:34.470 --> 08:36.220
I don't like Hank at all.

08:36.340 --> 08:37.299
I find him boorish.

08:37.429 --> 08:40.600
You two just
keep clear of those boys.

08:40.720 --> 08:43.390
You can have
all your prissy little adventures...

08:43.520 --> 08:44.680
or whatever with them.

08:44.810 --> 08:46.730
But if I catch y'all
getting too adventurous...

08:46.850 --> 08:47.810
I'm gonna tan your hides.

08:47.940 --> 08:48.860
Capiche?

08:48.980 --> 08:50.270
Yes, ma'am.

08:50.400 --> 08:52.360
Now, come here, you buttons!

08:53.360 --> 08:55.900
Virginia, why do you
hate men so much?

08:56.030 --> 08:57.740
I don't hate men, princess.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.530
I just never met a real one.

09:00.830 --> 09:03.370
- Well, ain't you a pretty one?
- Huh?

09:03.500 --> 09:04.660
Oh, hey.

09:04.790 --> 09:06.710
Brock Samson.
We weren't properly introduced.

09:06.830 --> 09:07.920
Virginia Donne.

09:08.040 --> 09:09.040
How's it hanging?

09:10.210 --> 09:13.420
Oh, oh, tough guy, huh?

09:13.550 --> 09:14.460
What do you drive?

09:14.590 --> 09:15.970
'69 Charger.

09:16.090 --> 09:18.090
Pfft, penis substitute.

09:19.890 --> 09:23.600
Of course, all them horsies
under the hood ain't worth...

09:23.720 --> 09:27.850
a damn in this rugged terrain
without all-wheel drive.

09:28.850 --> 09:33.610
Solid chassis,
pliant suspension, torque.

09:33.730 --> 09:35.320
Look, uh...

09:35.440 --> 09:36.360
Whew.

09:36.490 --> 09:38.610
Hot in the jungle, huh?

09:38.740 --> 09:40.070
Uh, yeah.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.450
Yes, it is. Yes, it is.

09:41.580 --> 09:44.700
Moist heat grips you like a vice.

09:44.830 --> 09:47.660
Maybe go for
a nice dip in the river?

09:48.670 --> 09:49.870
Skinny-dip?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.790
Um, yeah, maybe.
I'll do that.

09:52.920 --> 09:56.260
Ho-ho, ease off the gas,
there, Mustang Sally.

09:56.380 --> 09:59.720
Where I live, we drive
on the other side of the road.

09:59.840 --> 10:01.260
What the hell?

10:13.820 --> 10:14.900
Yes.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.320
Ahh.

10:26.830 --> 10:28.160
Wowza.

10:32.960 --> 10:34.670
Sex.

10:37.880 --> 10:38.880
Ahh.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.510
Down...now.

10:42.640 --> 10:44.510
Oh, Rusty,
you really should quit smoking.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.600
Don't... smoke.

10:46.720 --> 10:48.430
Then you really
need to get more exercise.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.310
Brock... second-hand...
killing me.

10:50.440 --> 10:53.520
Well, you can't tell me
this view wasn't worth the climb.

10:53.650 --> 10:57.440
But I want to show you
something even more special.

10:57.570 --> 10:59.440
God... yes.

10:59.570 --> 11:01.780
This is the entire reason I'm here.

11:01.910 --> 11:03.990
It's called Solomon's heart.

11:04.120 --> 11:06.830
This valley is the only place
on Earth it can grow.

11:06.950 --> 11:10.790
But they only blossom
on mature trees, over 40 years old.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.750
You see how the seeds form a heart?

11:12.880 --> 11:14.250
- I do.
- Now you know why...

11:14.380 --> 11:16.880
it's so desperately important
we protect this rainforest.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.920
Because hearts...

11:19.050 --> 11:21.720
Because these seeds
contain the antigens...

11:21.840 --> 11:24.720
that can cure cancer,
and who knows what else!

11:24.850 --> 11:26.810
- Loneliness?
- With further research, I--

11:26.930 --> 11:27.970
Did you say--

11:30.100 --> 11:32.230
- Ow.
- Oh, let me. I'm sorry.

11:33.230 --> 11:35.400
We should go.
It's getting dark, and I don't want to--

11:35.520 --> 11:37.230
- But I want to.
- I don't want to get hurt.

11:37.360 --> 11:38.570
You won't.

11:38.690 --> 11:39.780
That felt good, didn't it?

11:39.900 --> 11:42.490
It's not a good time. We have to
get back to camp before moonrise.

11:42.610 --> 11:43.990
I'm sorry.

11:44.120 --> 11:47.700
Wait a minute.

11:47.830 --> 11:48.740
Wait, how do I--

12:04.300 --> 12:06.930
- Oh, my god!
- You're the Were-o-dile!

12:07.050 --> 12:08.220
I'm not the Were-o-dile!

12:08.350 --> 12:09.310
You're the Were-o-dile!

12:09.430 --> 12:11.100
How could you?!
You're my brother!

12:11.230 --> 12:12.100
We're twins!

12:12.230 --> 12:14.730
That means I'm a Were-o-dile, too!

12:14.850 --> 12:16.190
Oh, no!

12:16.310 --> 12:18.610
That-- that doesn't really follow.

12:18.730 --> 12:21.230
I mean, we have different hair.

12:21.360 --> 12:23.780
And I have a huskier build,
let's admit it.

12:23.900 --> 12:25.780
Plus, I barely have hair under there.

12:25.910 --> 12:26.870
Me, too.

12:26.990 --> 12:28.120
Not for lack of trying.

12:29.950 --> 12:31.700
Run away!

12:34.170 --> 12:35.120
I got him.

12:35.250 --> 12:37.250
It was a close call, but I got him.

12:37.380 --> 12:40.460
God, frigging harness buckle
is digging into my back.

12:40.590 --> 12:42.300
- Is he dead?
- He looks dead.

12:42.420 --> 12:44.130
He was upside-down for a while.

12:44.260 --> 12:46.630
Blood probably rushed to his...

12:46.760 --> 12:47.970
- Ugh.
- Ugh.

12:48.100 --> 12:49.180
Who did that to pop?!

12:49.310 --> 12:50.760
Was it the Were-o-dile?

12:50.890 --> 12:51.810
Did you see him, Brock?

12:51.930 --> 12:54.060
No, I saw them.

12:54.190 --> 12:55.480
- Two of them.
- Two of them?

12:55.600 --> 12:56.770
Mummy? What's going on?

12:56.900 --> 12:58.730
Girls, thank god!

12:58.860 --> 12:59.770
Are you OK?

12:59.900 --> 13:01.820
We're fine.
What's going on?

13:01.940 --> 13:03.990
You're in shock.
We got to get you warm.

13:04.110 --> 13:07.030
All right, no more screwing around!

13:07.160 --> 13:10.490
This camp is officially
on full Were-o-dile alert!

13:10.620 --> 13:13.500
Everyone in their bunks
now, come on!

13:13.620 --> 13:14.660
Chop-chop!

13:14.790 --> 13:16.920
Hey, your own bunks, dick.

13:17.040 --> 13:19.170
Supercuts, you take first watch.

13:20.170 --> 13:22.130
I want them out of here.

13:22.250 --> 13:24.420
They're bringing
bad juju to this place.

13:24.550 --> 13:25.920
Really, Ginny?

13:26.050 --> 13:28.220
You know as well as I
this ridiculous Were-o-dile...

13:28.340 --> 13:30.430
is probably just some
logging company stooge...

13:30.550 --> 13:31.970
trying to put the scare into us.

13:32.100 --> 13:33.520
Ask Rusty.
He was a boy adventurer.

13:33.640 --> 13:36.270
I'm not asking him squat.
I don't like him.

13:36.390 --> 13:40.360
That's unfortunate,
because I plan to ask Dr. Venture...

13:40.480 --> 13:41.770
to be my...

13:41.900 --> 13:42.900
...lab assistant.

13:43.030 --> 13:45.740
Oh, no, not that.

13:45.860 --> 13:49.280
Oh, Ginny, if I didn't know better,
I'd think you were jealous.

13:49.410 --> 13:50.530
Don't you worry.

13:50.660 --> 13:52.330
I could never replace you.

13:52.450 --> 13:56.250
But I have needs you simply
aren't capable of fulfilling, Ginny.

13:56.370 --> 13:59.170
If you'd just give it a chance,
Tara Bear, I can be--

13:59.290 --> 14:02.380
Dr. Venture is a trained scientist.

14:02.500 --> 14:04.050
He can help me
in ways you never could.

14:04.170 --> 14:06.050
Yeah, like out of your shorts.

14:06.170 --> 14:07.380
Virginia!

14:07.510 --> 14:08.720
You forget your place.

14:08.840 --> 14:09.760
My place?

14:09.890 --> 14:12.510
My place is
watching out for your asses.

14:12.640 --> 14:14.260
Kindly remove your things...

14:14.390 --> 14:16.180
from this hut
and find lodging elsewhere.

14:16.310 --> 14:20.900
No, you kindly remember this,
little miss fancy britches.

14:21.020 --> 14:23.900
Just 'cause mommy and daddy
didn't love you enough...

14:24.020 --> 14:26.110
doesn't mean
I'm gonna clean up after you...

14:26.240 --> 14:29.070
every time you let a man
make a mess of your life!

14:29.200 --> 14:31.320
Get out! Get out!

14:31.450 --> 14:32.700
You monster!

14:32.830 --> 14:35.790
I know what you really are, Tara!

14:36.790 --> 14:39.250
Quit staring at my ass, Samson!

14:39.370 --> 14:40.370
No means no!

14:40.500 --> 14:42.630
Now get to your post.

14:45.710 --> 14:49.130
Stay calm. Stay calm.

14:49.260 --> 14:51.470
Don't let the demon out.

14:51.590 --> 14:54.140
Curiouser and curiouser.

14:54.260 --> 14:57.270
Dr. Quymn has a demon
she's afraid to let out.

14:57.390 --> 15:00.100
Yet she calls Ginny a monster.

15:00.230 --> 15:01.980
And both of them were in the woods...

15:02.100 --> 15:03.810
when Brock saw the Were-o-diles.

15:03.940 --> 15:07.650
But where were Nancy and Drew
that whole time?

15:07.780 --> 15:09.780
In their hut? Perhaps.

15:09.900 --> 15:11.740
Then again, perhaps not!

15:11.860 --> 15:13.910
One thing is certain, however.

15:14.030 --> 15:19.120
Someone or someones
in this camp is the Were-o-dile!

15:19.250 --> 15:22.370
And we're gonna get
to the bottom of-- Hank...

15:22.500 --> 15:23.460
are you listening to me?

15:23.580 --> 15:24.830
Actually, can you keep it down?

15:24.960 --> 15:26.670
I'm trying to write a song for the girls.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.460
Will you get with the program?

15:28.590 --> 15:29.800
We've got a mystery to solve.

15:29.920 --> 15:32.300
Then we should team up
with the girls.

15:32.430 --> 15:34.550
We can't!
They're-- they're suspects.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.010
Then solve it tomorrow or something.

15:37.140 --> 15:38.310
Man, what's your hurry?

15:38.430 --> 15:39.720
What's your slow-ey?

15:39.850 --> 15:43.520
You've gone soft on me,
Henry Allen so-called Venture!

15:43.650 --> 15:45.730
You used to be all,
"go, Team Venture!"

15:45.860 --> 15:50.070
But now--
now you're all, "go, team...

15:50.190 --> 15:51.690
"B-boobies!"

15:51.820 --> 15:53.030
Gosh!

15:54.030 --> 15:56.320
The natives are getting restless.

15:56.450 --> 15:57.660
We're not long for this world.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.500
Then before they kill us
and shrink our heads...

16:00.620 --> 16:04.670
and cut us up and eat us,
kiss me, Dr. Venture.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.130
That's it.

16:13.340 --> 16:16.050
Oh, yes,
I'm having the time of my life!

16:16.180 --> 16:18.260
Aah!

16:22.560 --> 16:23.810
Rusty?

16:23.940 --> 16:27.810
Would you like to come
and play in my jungle fort?

16:32.530 --> 16:33.990
Ready, Drew?

16:34.110 --> 16:36.570
Ready, Freddie, Nancy Fancy.

16:40.790 --> 16:43.370
Hey, Hank.

16:43.500 --> 16:44.830
You're supposed to stay in your--

16:44.960 --> 16:47.710
- Hey, Brock.
- Oh, hey, it's Dean.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.540
Well, looks like it's up to me and you...

16:49.670 --> 16:51.380
to solve the mystery of the Were-o-dile.

16:51.510 --> 16:54.170
Everyone else has
dumb girls on the brain.

16:54.300 --> 16:57.180
All right,
you big Nebraskan oak.

16:57.300 --> 16:59.180
Don't make me regret this.

16:59.300 --> 17:00.680
You, too, Brock?!

17:00.810 --> 17:02.430
You, too?!

17:02.560 --> 17:05.310
The both of youse got jungle fever!

17:05.440 --> 17:06.560
The both of youse.

17:06.690 --> 17:08.560
Screw this.

17:08.690 --> 17:10.609
Mood's totally blown.

17:12.569 --> 17:14.359
Huh?

17:14.490 --> 17:15.530
Ah.

17:16.780 --> 17:18.910
"Meet me in the clearing
in 1 0 minutes."

17:19.030 --> 17:20.069
Hank?

17:20.200 --> 17:21.160
- Yeah?
- Hank!

17:21.290 --> 17:22.869
Find some dynamite and a big cargo net...

17:23.000 --> 17:25.119
and meet me behind the camp
in 1 0 minutes-- 1 0!

17:25.250 --> 17:27.329
- But--
- No buts! Do it!

17:27.460 --> 17:29.380
The mystery is afoot.

17:32.170 --> 17:34.130
Shh, it's me.

17:34.260 --> 17:36.340
Why are you walking
through the jungle backwards?

17:36.470 --> 17:37.380
I- I- I don't know.

17:37.510 --> 17:39.930
Look, I'd love to chat, but I
really can't, 'cause-- aah!

17:40.050 --> 17:41.550
Shh, it's me.

17:41.680 --> 17:43.850
And we've solved
the mystery of the Were-o-dile.

17:43.970 --> 17:46.020
- You have? Well who--
- Not here.

17:46.140 --> 17:47.390
Come back to our hut.

17:47.520 --> 17:48.690
We'll show you everything.

17:48.810 --> 17:49.810
But Hank...

17:54.110 --> 17:55.940
A storm is coming.

17:56.070 --> 17:57.490
Can smell it.

17:58.740 --> 18:01.950
Hard rain's gonna fall.

18:02.080 --> 18:02.990
Hard rain.

18:07.580 --> 18:09.330
Whoa!

18:09.460 --> 18:11.960
Think I just found
my cure for impotence after all.

18:12.090 --> 18:14.210
Now, if I could just
find a way to bottle that ass...

18:14.340 --> 18:16.090
I'd be a multimillionaire.

18:19.970 --> 18:21.050
Here, have some of this.

18:21.180 --> 18:22.180
What's--

18:22.300 --> 18:25.260
It's a native potion
to ward off the Were-o-dile.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.900
Where's Hank?
He said he'd be here.

18:31.020 --> 18:32.940
Don't worry.
He won't bother us.

18:33.070 --> 18:34.980
Just relax.

18:35.110 --> 18:39.610
And we'll show you everything.

18:40.610 --> 18:44.030
Oh, wow. OK, OK.

18:44.160 --> 18:48.830
Oh, Rusty, you've no idea
how long it's been.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.330
1 9 years, 2 months and 4 days.

18:50.460 --> 18:52.000
W-w-wait!

18:53.250 --> 18:54.500
Why-- whoa, what are you...

18:54.630 --> 18:56.340
Please, we have to stop...

18:56.460 --> 18:57.590
Aah!

18:57.710 --> 18:58.670
Help!

18:58.800 --> 18:59.670
Oh, this isn't happening!

18:59.800 --> 19:01.260
Help!

19:02.260 --> 19:03.850
Just enjoy this.

19:03.970 --> 19:05.180
Oh, my god!

19:05.310 --> 19:06.970
You're the Were-o-diles!

19:07.100 --> 19:08.850
Help!

19:08.980 --> 19:11.690
Get your filthy mitts off of her!

19:13.150 --> 19:14.060
What was that?

19:14.190 --> 19:15.860
Ginny, what are you do--

19:15.980 --> 19:17.940
I'm not gonna let him
break your heart again!

19:18.070 --> 19:20.280
I'm not gonna let you
put your seed in her...

19:20.400 --> 19:21.530
and walk out that door again!

19:21.660 --> 19:23.070
Brock, Brock!

19:24.070 --> 19:25.410
Ow! Brock!

19:25.530 --> 19:28.870
Oh, bodyguard,
bodyguard, anyone?

19:29.000 --> 19:33.040
She's not the same
liquored-up little teenage...

19:33.170 --> 19:34.380
rich girl that you--

19:34.500 --> 19:35.540
What teenager?

19:35.670 --> 19:37.500
I haven't seen her since I was 1 0!

19:37.630 --> 19:41.130
She doesn't need
your pills or your booze...

19:41.260 --> 19:43.220
or your shock therapy anymore!

19:43.340 --> 19:46.220
I fixed her, not you!

19:46.350 --> 19:51.180
I did! Me, me, me, me!

19:52.310 --> 19:53.690
Oh, I see how it is.

19:54.690 --> 19:57.480
- Damn, you're strong.
- Bring it on!

19:58.860 --> 19:59.860
Try it again, asshole!

19:59.990 --> 20:01.820
Damn, you're strong for a crazy old bitch!

20:01.950 --> 20:03.950
She can fight!

20:04.950 --> 20:06.030
You're acting...

20:08.040 --> 20:10.660
Dr. Quymn is the Were-o-dile!

20:10.790 --> 20:13.830
She's-- Oh, my god,
I almost fucked a Were-o-dile.

20:13.960 --> 20:16.790
We have to stop her transformation
before she kills us all!

20:18.800 --> 20:20.550
The power of Christ compels you!

20:21.800 --> 20:24.090
Stop it, you little asshole!

20:24.220 --> 20:25.760
She's not a Were-o-dile!

20:25.890 --> 20:27.350
She's an epileptic!

20:27.470 --> 20:28.510
Ew!

20:29.510 --> 20:31.350
OK, OK.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.350
You're OK, Tara Bear.

20:33.480 --> 20:35.900
You're with Ginny now.

20:36.020 --> 20:37.650
You've come a long way, baby.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.020
Where's my amulet?

20:39.150 --> 20:40.980
Oh, geez, OK.
Just this once.

20:43.530 --> 20:46.070
Any--
anybody got a light for her?

20:47.490 --> 20:48.910
Ah, ladies.

20:49.030 --> 20:50.330
Fashionably late, I see.

21:13.390 --> 21:14.430
Hey.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.730
We never even believed...

21:16.850 --> 21:18.310
there was an actual Were-o-dile.

21:18.440 --> 21:19.480
I mean, it's preposterous.

21:19.610 --> 21:22.530
And we certainly
didn't mean for Hank to get hurt.

21:22.650 --> 21:25.280
Tell your brother
he's a real hero for what he did.

21:25.400 --> 21:26.780
The natives already did.

21:26.910 --> 21:28.740
They even made him an honorary warrior...

21:28.870 --> 21:30.160
and gave him a circumcision.

21:30.280 --> 21:32.030
- Oh.
- Hmm.

21:32.160 --> 21:34.000
Does that mean you aren't...

21:34.120 --> 21:35.080
Ew.

21:35.210 --> 21:36.410
Don't talk to him, girls.

21:36.540 --> 21:38.290
Ginny, darling! Come along!

21:38.420 --> 21:39.420
We're going!

21:40.460 --> 21:43.750
Hey. How you holding
up there, broken arrow?

21:43.880 --> 21:44.840
Can I get you anything?

21:44.970 --> 21:46.670
I could use a cocoa.

21:46.800 --> 21:49.010
Do we have any cocoa?

21:49.140 --> 21:50.260
Or something stronger?

21:50.390 --> 21:53.640
I just don't want to feel
anything anymore, Brock.

21:54.640 --> 21:56.640
Oh, god.

21:57.305 --> 22:03.360
