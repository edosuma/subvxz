00:13.480 --> 00:14.514
Hey, Shana.

00:14.547 --> 00:15.715
Hi, Mikey.

00:15.749 --> 00:18.184
So, um,
this is where your locker is.

00:18.218 --> 00:20.487
( laughs ) This is
where all the lockers are.

00:21.721 --> 00:24.090
Do you still need help
with math after school?

00:24.124 --> 00:25.492
( laughs ) That'd be great!

00:25.525 --> 00:27.560
My dad tried to
help me last night,

00:27.594 --> 00:29.362
but he just
kept screaming that

00:29.396 --> 00:31.164
all the answers in
the book were wrong.

00:31.197 --> 00:33.500
Well, why didn't you just
ask Duncan for help?

00:33.533 --> 00:34.768
( snorts ) Duncan's a yo-yo.

00:34.801 --> 00:36.336
Besides, we broke up.

00:36.369 --> 00:37.837
You broke up?

00:37.871 --> 00:39.305
Well, see you later.

00:39.773 --> 00:40.807
Yeah, bye.

00:41.641 --> 00:44.110
All right! They broke up. Yes!

00:45.545 --> 00:47.447
( bell rings )

00:47.480 --> 00:48.882
<i>* When I wake</i>
<i>up in the morning</i>

00:48.915 --> 00:50.450
<i>* and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:50.483 --> 00:53.620
<i>* I don't think</i>
<i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:53.653 --> 00:56.489
<i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
<i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:56.523 --> 00:59.859
<i>* I'm at the corner</i>
<i>just in time to</i>
<i>see the bus fly by</i>

00:59.893 --> 01:04.197
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

01:05.665 --> 01:08.635
<i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
<i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

01:08.668 --> 01:11.671
<i>* And my dog ate</i>
<i>all my homework last night</i>

01:11.705 --> 01:14.641
<i>* Ridin' low in my chair</i>
<i>She won't know that I'm there</i>

01:14.674 --> 01:18.345
<i>* If I can hand it in tomorrow</i>
<i>it'll be all right</i>

01:18.378 --> 01:22.182
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

01:36.663 --> 01:39.466
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

01:39.499 --> 01:42.602
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

01:42.635 --> 01:46.339
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:54.014 --> 01:55.782
She's coming, she's coming.

01:55.815 --> 01:58.918
 Carrie: <i>JFK hasn't had</i>
<i>a dance in six years.</i>

01:58.952 --> 02:01.921
<i>Ever since Billy</i>
<i>Pennington broke</i>
<i>Kevin Diamond's nose</i>

02:01.955 --> 02:04.057
<i>in a fight over Julie Burnett.</i>

02:04.057 --> 02:08.328
<i>Kevin's mom</i>
<i>settled out of court</i>
<i>for an apology and a nose job.</i>

02:10.363 --> 02:11.698
Miss Bliss,

02:12.365 --> 02:13.566
we want...

02:14.768 --> 02:16.736
No, no, we demand...

02:19.339 --> 02:22.308
Well, we'd really appreciate
an eighth-grade dance.

02:22.342 --> 02:25.578
I'm sorry, Nikki.
You know Mr. Belding's rule.

02:25.612 --> 02:26.646
No dances.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.882
( all clamoring )

02:28.915 --> 02:32.318
It's just not fair...
We don't even know
what the dumb fight was about.

02:32.352 --> 02:34.587
I heard it had something to do
with Belding's daughter,

02:34.621 --> 02:36.623
the woodshop
teacher and a clam.

02:38.358 --> 02:40.794
Zack, those are all rumors.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.896
Mr. Belding doesn't
even have a daughter.

02:42.929 --> 02:45.598
Then why did he let
her go to the dance?

02:45.632 --> 02:48.735
Miss Bliss, whatever went on
at that dance
wasn't our fault.

02:48.768 --> 02:50.737
Yeah, we're being
punished for something

02:50.770 --> 02:52.939
that happened when we
were eight years old.

02:52.972 --> 02:55.342
Yeah,
when I was eight years old,

02:55.375 --> 02:58.011
I was grounded for waxing
my dad's car with our cat.

02:59.612 --> 03:02.615
You know, Fluffy still
beads up when it rains.

03:03.616 --> 03:06.419
You know something,
Nikki, you're right.

03:06.453 --> 03:09.956
You deserve that dance.
I'll talk to Mr. Belding.

03:10.056 --> 03:11.958
( stuttering ) And
furthermore, I mean

03:12.058 --> 03:13.927
dancing's a part of
our social development.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.428
It's part of our youth...

03:15.462 --> 03:16.696
Nikki!

03:16.730 --> 03:19.632
You're the only person I know
who can't take
yes for an answer.

03:22.936 --> 03:24.070
( laughing )

03:24.070 --> 03:25.605
Carrie, I got a great idea.

03:25.638 --> 03:27.073
Let's drive up to
Bloomington for the

03:27.073 --> 03:28.608
Indiana-Michigan
game next weekend.

03:28.641 --> 03:30.543
Oh,
Tina, I'd love to, but I have

03:30.577 --> 03:32.445
the Save
the Whales dinner with...

03:32.479 --> 03:33.880
( mumbles ) Sherman.

03:33.913 --> 03:35.448
Did you say Sherman?

03:35.482 --> 03:36.983
No, I mumbled Sherman.

03:37.083 --> 03:40.487
Oh, I cannot believe that
you agreed to go
with him again.

03:40.520 --> 03:43.823
Last year didn't he
jump into this aquarium to,
and I quote,

03:43.857 --> 03:46.526
"become one with Shamu"?

03:46.559 --> 03:48.495
Actually, it was kind
of touching watching

03:48.528 --> 03:50.397
them go through
the hoop together.

03:51.164 --> 03:53.099
Carrie, he's a dork.

03:53.099 --> 03:54.834
Tina, he's Sherman.

03:54.868 --> 03:58.171
We worked together
on this fundraiser
for the last four years.

03:58.204 --> 04:00.440
It's an obligation.

04:00.473 --> 04:03.343
I give up one Saturday night,
and it's over.

04:03.376 --> 04:06.579
Well, think positively.
Maybe he'll get sick.

04:06.613 --> 04:07.781
Dorks never get sick.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.952
<i>Attention all students,</i>
<i>the CPR program</i>
<i>will not be held</i>

04:13.053 --> 04:16.822
<i>until</i>
<i>a replacement can be found</i>
<i>for the late Mr. Floyd.</i>

04:19.125 --> 04:20.560
So what can I do for you two?

04:22.829 --> 04:25.832
We would like to reinstate
the eighth-grade dance.

04:26.166 --> 04:27.367
( laughs )

04:27.400 --> 04:28.968
I'll pretend I
didn't hear that.

04:30.670 --> 04:33.840
I understand
your past concern,
but that was then.

04:33.873 --> 04:38.078
And this is now, which means,
and I quote, "no."

04:38.111 --> 04:41.114
But these are
good kids, really,
they deserve a dance.

04:41.147 --> 04:44.918
Mr. Belding,
remember your
eighth grade dance?

04:44.951 --> 04:49.089
The romance, the expectation,
the excitement?

04:49.122 --> 04:51.424
Of course I do,
I had a date with

04:51.458 --> 04:53.626
the girl of my dreams,
Carol Petchorik.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.595
What was she like?

04:55.628 --> 05:00.567
She was tall and
slender and beautiful
and popular.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.569
When she said yes,
I couldn't believe it.

05:04.037 --> 05:07.440
Neither could she.
She changed her mind
and went with Buck Sinclair.

05:08.875 --> 05:11.044
( whispering ) I'm
going to teach now.

05:13.646 --> 05:15.715
I hated Buck Sinclair.

05:15.749 --> 05:17.584
I got even with him.

05:17.617 --> 05:19.586
Last semester I
suspended his kid.

05:21.588 --> 05:24.090
Mr. Belding,
I think it's very unfair

05:24.124 --> 05:25.959
that these kids
should be penalized

05:26.059 --> 05:27.794
for something they
had nothing to do with.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.629
This seems very
important to you.

05:29.662 --> 05:32.632
It is.
I believe in these kids.

05:32.665 --> 05:36.936
Well,
I'm not so sure about them,
but I do believe in you,

05:36.970 --> 05:39.205
so... Okay.

05:39.239 --> 05:41.107
But the dance has
to be next Saturday,

05:41.141 --> 05:43.843
because the cafeteria is
booked through spring.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.945
Next Saturday will be fine.

05:45.979 --> 05:48.114
And,
of course, you will be there

05:48.148 --> 05:50.216
to chaperone
this little soiree.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.085
That's a problem.

05:52.085 --> 05:54.721
Well,
that was the fastest dance
in school history.

05:54.754 --> 05:56.990
Hope you enjoyed
yourself as much as I did.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.658
But I've got plans.

05:59.259 --> 06:01.394
Let me put this simply.

06:01.428 --> 06:05.031
If you don't chaperone,
no one shakes their boogies.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.499
It's booties.

06:10.503 --> 06:13.740
Lisa, Lisa, guess what?
Jordan asked me to the dance.

06:13.773 --> 06:15.942
Well, that's great.
So who are you going with?

06:16.042 --> 06:17.610
I just told you. Jordan.

06:17.644 --> 06:21.715
Rule number one, never say yes
to the first guy who asks.

06:21.748 --> 06:23.116
But if you like him, why not?

06:23.149 --> 06:25.151
Because somebody
better may come along.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.588
Oh. Anybody ask you?

06:28.621 --> 06:31.091
Yeah, Jeffrey, Bob, Steven...

06:31.124 --> 06:33.593
I got to school late.

06:33.626 --> 06:36.229
I'm surprised No-neck Nelson
hasn't asked you.

06:36.262 --> 06:38.064
I know, you everywhere.

06:38.064 --> 06:39.866
I've been
avoiding him all morning,

06:39.899 --> 06:43.536
he's the only guy
in school that makes
Screech look like Rob Lowe.

06:44.571 --> 06:45.905
Thanks!

06:50.910 --> 06:52.679
So,
Mikey, what's the big secret?

06:56.716 --> 06:57.951
It's about the dance.

06:57.984 --> 07:01.788
Hey,
look, I'm not going to teach
you to dance in the bathroom.

07:01.821 --> 07:03.857
( knocking )
Screech:
Hey, guys open up in there.

07:03.890 --> 07:08.194
Sorry, Screech, it's <i>ocupado.</i>
Use the bathroom
on the second floor.

07:08.228 --> 07:10.163
Screech: I don't know
if I'm going to make it.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.432
So what's up?

07:12.465 --> 07:16.636
Well, I wanna ask
this girl to the dance,
but I don't wanna blow it.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.605
I need your help.

07:18.638 --> 07:23.076
Okay. First of all,
girls like to be called women.

07:23.109 --> 07:24.944
Women. Right.

07:25.045 --> 07:28.815
And second,
when you're talking to them,
look deep into their eyes.

07:29.082 --> 07:30.517
Deep.

07:30.550 --> 07:35.588
And last, and most important,
let her know
that you think she's awesome.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.624
Okay, I got it.

07:39.059 --> 07:41.528
Woman, you are awesome.

07:42.228 --> 07:44.064
I can't do this, it isn't me.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.966
Hey, it isn't anyone,
but it works.

07:47.067 --> 07:50.570
Hey, relax, you remember
Debbie Rinder's slumber party?

07:50.603 --> 07:52.639
Yeah, you let me
stand on your shoulder,

07:52.672 --> 07:55.075
so I could climb that tree
and peak at the girls.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.876
Yeah, and we ended
up in the wrong tree

07:56.910 --> 07:59.312
and watched Debbie's
grandmother soak her teeth.

08:00.680 --> 08:02.782
See, Mikey, you
weren't afraid to go after

08:02.816 --> 08:04.818
your girl then.
So don't be afraid now.

08:05.552 --> 08:06.753
( knocking at door )

08:06.786 --> 08:09.155
Screech: Hey, guys,
the second floor
bathroom's out of order.

08:09.189 --> 08:10.757
So try the one on
the first floor.

08:10.790 --> 08:13.827
Screech: This is
the first floor. Open up.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.030
Can't you take a hint?

08:17.030 --> 08:18.064
Hi!

08:18.798 --> 08:20.233
Mr. Belding, sir.

08:20.266 --> 08:21.935
What's going on in here?

08:22.035 --> 08:24.037
We were just
cleaning off the graffiti.

08:24.037 --> 08:25.839
And you expect me
to believe that?

08:25.872 --> 08:27.040
It was about you.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.743
Well,
keep up the good work, boys.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.317
Hi, Zack.

08:37.350 --> 08:40.053
Hey, Shana. How's it going?

08:40.053 --> 08:42.322
Fine. Isn't it
great about the dance?

08:42.355 --> 08:43.823
Yeah. Are you going?

08:43.857 --> 08:46.793
I hope to. My mom let
me buy a new mini skirt.

08:47.227 --> 08:48.261
Mini skirt?

08:48.294 --> 08:49.629
Leather.

08:49.662 --> 08:51.264
Leather?

08:51.297 --> 08:55.969
Mmm-hmm. And the best part is
I don't have to be
home until 11:30.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.904
But the dance ends at 9:00.

08:57.937 --> 08:59.639
What could you possibly do
for two and a half...

09:01.641 --> 09:03.176
Would you like to go
to the dance with me?

09:03.209 --> 09:05.845
Sure, I'd love to go with you.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.181
Uh, would noon be too
early to pick you up?

09:16.156 --> 09:22.028
Hey, Mikey, I can't
believe it, I got a B-plus.
My dad will croak.

09:22.028 --> 09:26.299
Great.
I mean that you got a B-plus,
not that your dad might croak.

09:26.332 --> 09:28.601
And it's all
because of your help.

09:30.103 --> 09:33.873
I still don't get
how you understand
this stuff so easily.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.609
You look awesome.

09:36.643 --> 09:38.178
Is there something
wrong with your eyes?

09:39.879 --> 09:42.849
I'm trying to
ask you if you want
to go to the dance with me.

09:42.882 --> 09:44.317
Really?'d love to.

09:44.351 --> 09:47.354
But I already have
a date with Zack Morris.

09:57.197 --> 10:00.900
Miss Bliss,
I hate to tell you this,
but we have to have a meeting.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.903
We've had our meeting.
This is the fifth
meeting in two days.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.638
It's only
an eighth-grade dance.

10:05.672 --> 10:08.908
Tell that to Mr. Belding.
He's got a few
more precautions.

10:08.942 --> 10:11.177
Let me guess.
Number one, no fun.

10:11.211 --> 10:16.182
Actually, that's number two.
Number one is no slow dancing.

10:16.216 --> 10:19.619
Okay, Mylo, give me the rest
of Mr. Good Times no-no's.

10:19.652 --> 10:24.057
Okay. No loud music,
no sticky foods,
no low lights.

10:24.090 --> 10:26.760
And he's still
debating whether
the dance should be co-ed.

10:27.327 --> 10:29.195
What kind of a party is this?

10:29.229 --> 10:31.231
Not a good one.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.366
If it ever gets going,
it'll be boring.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.835
Certainly not like
my eighth-grade dance.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.371
Best time I ever had.
We partied all night.

10:38.405 --> 10:42.742
( laughs ) Aw, Mylo, Mr.
Belding would
never let that happen here.

10:43.877 --> 10:46.780
What he doesn't know,
won't hurt him.

10:49.015 --> 10:51.084
So how many people have asked
you to the dance so far?

10:51.117 --> 10:53.987
One, two, three, four...
Ten and a half.

10:54.020 --> 10:55.088
Half?

10:55.121 --> 10:57.757
I'm counting
the No-neck as a half.

10:57.791 --> 11:00.894
You mean if he asked you,
you'd actually consider going?

11:00.927 --> 11:03.830
Are you kidding?
I'd rather go with Screech.

11:06.700 --> 11:09.869
I think it's about time to
have that talk with Dad.

11:17.410 --> 11:19.212
You know,
I still can't believe

11:19.245 --> 11:21.348
Mr. Belding won't
let us have a band.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.350
Look,
Lisa, not having a band isn't

11:23.383 --> 11:25.719
the end of the world.
We'll just play records.

11:25.752 --> 11:28.221
Records? That's so low-tech.

11:28.254 --> 11:31.358
Now, we have to find a DJ.

11:31.391 --> 11:35.395
I think we need
somebody who's funky.
Somebody with soul.

11:35.428 --> 11:37.931
Hey, party animals.
This is the prince of pop,

11:37.964 --> 11:40.233
the sultan of soul,
the king of crazy music.

11:40.266 --> 11:43.937
So get ready to
shake your keister,
'cause I'm the Screechster.

11:44.337 --> 11:45.972
Screech, no.

11:47.807 --> 11:50.176
Oh, I get it. You two
are afraid that if I DJ,

11:50.210 --> 11:52.812
I won't be free
to dance with you.

11:55.015 --> 11:56.182
You got the job, Screech.

11:58.918 --> 12:01.187
So I guess 'cause of
the dance, you've got

12:01.221 --> 12:04.224
to cancel your date
with Sherman, huh?

12:04.257 --> 12:09.729
Not exactly. While I
thought I was canceling,
he thought I was inviting.

12:09.763 --> 12:11.398
He'll be here.

12:11.431 --> 12:15.769
Why don't the whales
get together and have
a Save the Sherman dinner?

12:16.870 --> 12:18.738
( laughs )

12:18.772 --> 12:21.341
Hey, Mikey, look what I made.
A weasel.

12:23.743 --> 12:25.111
Pop goes the weasel.

12:25.145 --> 12:26.279
Hey, what'd you do that for?

12:26.312 --> 12:28.314
Does the name
Shana ring a bell?

12:28.348 --> 12:30.116
Yeah, so what?
I'm taking her to the dance.

12:32.485 --> 12:35.422
Uh-oh.
This is the girl that...
Mikey, I had no idea.

12:35.455 --> 12:37.257
Don't even try to con me.

12:37.290 --> 12:40.760
I'm not. I didn't know.
You never even
told me her name.

12:40.794 --> 12:42.095
Great, then cancel.

12:42.128 --> 12:46.966
You can't be serious.
I mean, this involves
a great-looking girl.

12:47.000 --> 12:50.470
You know,
you're nothing but a slimy,
back-stabbing doofus.

12:50.503 --> 12:52.272
Hey, don't push me.

12:52.305 --> 12:55.809
Hey! Hey,
you two, my classroom, now.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.748
I saw that. They pushed.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.050
Pushing leads to shoving,
shoving leads to fighting

13:04.050 --> 13:07.287
and then fighting leads
to lawsuits and nose jobs.

13:07.320 --> 13:10.724
Please calm down.
It's really nothing.

13:10.757 --> 13:12.359
I'm sure it's just
a misunderstanding.

13:12.392 --> 13:15.495
( chanting ) Tonight,
that's right,
there's going to be a fight.

13:15.528 --> 13:19.065
Hey, tonight, that's right,
there's gonna be a fight.

13:25.171 --> 13:28.308
You have exactly 10 seconds to
tell me what's going on.

13:31.077 --> 13:32.445
Make that nine.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.815
Well, Mr. Teen Idol kidnapped
my date to the dance.

13:35.849 --> 13:38.852
It's not kidnapping
when they go willingly.

13:38.885 --> 13:42.355
I think I get the picture.
Best friends
fighting over a girl.

13:42.389 --> 13:43.423
Sit down.

13:47.127 --> 13:50.563
Now that's
pretty serious stuff.
But so is friendship.

13:51.398 --> 13:52.632
What friendship?

13:52.665 --> 13:57.537
What friendship?
Mikey, I bet there were
a million guys willing

13:57.570 --> 13:59.606
to dismantle their bikes,
so your go-kart could

13:59.639 --> 14:01.808
have wheels for
the soap box derby.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.043
It was his sister's bike.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.444
That's not the point, Mikey.

14:06.046 --> 14:07.480
It was your sister's bike?

14:08.882 --> 14:12.352
No, it wasn't. She lost
it to me in a card game.

14:12.385 --> 14:15.188
And, Zack, I'll bet
there were a lot of guys

14:15.221 --> 14:18.258
just lining up
to help you with
your English paper last year?

14:18.291 --> 14:19.859
Yeah,
I wrote every word of that.

14:19.893 --> 14:24.330
Oh, right, you still think
<i>Catcher in</i>
<i>the Rye's</i> a baseball story.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.865
Now, look, boys!

14:27.567 --> 14:30.503
You can't let
a girl come between you.

14:30.537 --> 14:33.506
Your
friendship's too important.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.308
It can last a lifetime.

14:36.276 --> 14:38.211
Think about what
you'd be giving up.

14:39.546 --> 14:42.115
I'm counting on you to
settle this peacefully.

14:45.285 --> 14:46.319
Okay?

14:54.160 --> 14:56.863
If you bring
Shana to the dance,
you're a dead man.

15:02.936 --> 15:04.904
( dance music playing )

15:23.189 --> 15:25.625
So which lucky guy did
you choose to come with?

15:25.658 --> 15:27.060
All of them.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.194
All 10 of them?

15:28.228 --> 15:31.364
Shh! It's a secret,
they don't know
about each other.

15:31.398 --> 15:33.266
Hey, uh, do you
think Mikey's gonna show?

15:33.299 --> 15:35.335
I hope not,
I've never seen him this mad.

15:38.571 --> 15:41.341
So how's your
evening with Sherman going?

15:42.308 --> 15:43.410
Ooh!

15:44.577 --> 15:46.112
Well...

15:46.146 --> 15:48.081
Just imagine,
after this is over,

15:48.114 --> 15:50.450
you still get to go
to the dinner with him.

15:50.483 --> 15:53.086
I hope he's better at
catching tossed salad.

15:53.086 --> 15:54.120
( laughs )

15:55.221 --> 15:57.190
( all cheering
and applauding )

16:03.029 --> 16:04.230
<i>That was my personal favorite,</i>

16:04.264 --> 16:06.633
<i>Wanda and the Whiners</i>
<i>with</i> Vaporize My Love,

16:06.666 --> 16:10.036
<i>but now let's go</i>
<i>to the flipside</i>
<i>with</i> Love My Vaporizer.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.538
( all laughing )

16:17.243 --> 16:19.512
That was great.
You're a really
good dancer, Zack.

16:19.546 --> 16:22.048
Hey, I can't take all
the credit. I was just

16:22.048 --> 16:24.684
following your legs...
I mean, your lead.

16:24.718 --> 16:27.053
I'm thirsty, I'm going
to go get some punch.
You want some?

16:27.087 --> 16:28.121
Sure, thanks.

16:31.057 --> 16:32.659
( sarcastic )
Having a nice time?

16:33.293 --> 16:35.595
Yeah, great.

16:35.628 --> 16:38.365
Do you realize you threw away
a life-long friendship

16:38.398 --> 16:40.567
for a red leather mini skirt?

16:41.301 --> 16:43.436
I knew you'd understand.

16:43.470 --> 16:48.308
No, I don't understand.
Zack, you stabbed
your best friend in the back.

16:48.341 --> 16:52.078
Shana, why don't we go outside
and get some fresh air?

16:54.714 --> 16:56.583
Did you hear that? Stabbing.

16:56.616 --> 16:59.219
Whatever happened
to spit ball fights?

16:59.252 --> 17:01.621
Mr. Belding,
I talked to Mikey and Zack,

17:01.654 --> 17:04.190
there isn't going
to be any fight.

17:05.025 --> 17:07.193
Just relax. Mingle.

17:07.660 --> 17:08.728
Talk to Sherman.

17:10.663 --> 17:13.433
( gagging and coughing )

17:15.201 --> 17:19.039
I have talked to Sherman.
Please don't
make me do it again.

17:19.039 --> 17:21.174
( all
applauding and cheering )

17:23.609 --> 17:25.444
<i>Thank you, you're beautiful.</i>

17:25.478 --> 17:27.414
<i>But now</i>
<i>the Screechster would like</i>

17:27.446 --> 17:29.315
<i>to introduce you to</i>
<i>our special guest DJ,</i>

17:29.349 --> 17:31.651
<i>Mr. Music himself.</i>

17:31.685 --> 17:33.453
( all
applauding and cheering )

17:35.755 --> 17:38.458
Thank you very much,
thank you,
thank you, thank you.

17:38.491 --> 17:42.462
<i>Hello, my children,</i>
<i>this is Mellow Mylo.</i>

17:42.495 --> 17:47.500
<i>Picture this, it's evening,</i>
<i>the moon is full</i>
<i>and so is your heart.</i>

17:47.534 --> 17:50.737
<i>It's time to show</i>
<i>that special someone</i>
<i>just how you feel.</i>

17:50.770 --> 17:53.606
<i>So lead her by</i>
<i>the hand out to the</i>

17:53.640 --> 17:56.476
<i>dance floor,</i>
<i>and let Mylo take you home.</i>

17:57.110 --> 17:58.611
<i>Take you home.</i>

17:58.645 --> 18:00.613
( dance music playing )

18:24.504 --> 18:27.674
Mr. Belding, look at you.

18:27.707 --> 18:30.410
You've been worried
all night for nothing.

18:30.443 --> 18:34.447
Now the dance is almost over,
and you haven't
enjoyed a moment of it.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.216
You know something,
you're right.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.084
Maybe I have been
worried for nothing.

18:38.118 --> 18:40.653
Maybe I should
just relax a little,
and boogie down.

18:43.156 --> 18:45.392
I usually only get like
this on New Year's Eve.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.294
( music stops )

18:58.705 --> 19:01.274
I'm gonna stop this right now.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.777
Mr. Belding,
they're going to settle this
whether we're here or not,

19:03.810 --> 19:07.280
so isn't it better that
they do it when we are?

19:07.313 --> 19:10.083
All right,
but if they start fighting,
I'll take the little guy.

19:13.386 --> 19:16.322
Zack,
is there something going on
I don't know about?

19:16.356 --> 19:18.091
You mean,
you didn't even tell her? Oh!

19:18.124 --> 19:19.159
Tell me what?

19:19.192 --> 19:21.294
I can't believe
you did this to me.

19:21.327 --> 19:23.196
Stay out of it, Nikki.

19:23.229 --> 19:24.230
Stay out of what?

19:24.264 --> 19:27.167
You know, you always get
everything you want, Zack.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.802
Why is it
the one time I wanted

19:28.835 --> 19:30.704
something,
you had to get it, too?

19:30.737 --> 19:32.806
It, in this case, means you.

19:32.839 --> 19:37.477
Look, I like you both.
I don't want you
guys fighting over me.

19:37.510 --> 19:41.514
We're not.
It's between me and
my ex best-friend.

19:43.717 --> 19:45.819
You and me, outside now.

19:45.852 --> 19:48.688
Ooh, I didn't know
it was so intense.

19:48.722 --> 19:52.192
Mikey, I'm not
going outside with you.

19:52.225 --> 19:53.760
Fine,
we'll settle it right here.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.628
I never thought I'd do
anything to make you this mad.

19:55.662 --> 19:56.796
Well, you have.

19:56.830 --> 19:58.298
Then I was wrong, Mikey.

19:58.331 --> 19:59.366
I'm sorry.

20:00.533 --> 20:04.738
Go ahead.
Hit me. I deserve it.

20:04.771 --> 20:08.208
Please,
don't stop being my friend.
That'll hurt a lot more.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.411
( sighs )

20:12.278 --> 20:14.180
( all cheering
and applauding )

20:15.815 --> 20:17.751
Thank you.

20:17.784 --> 20:19.853
I'll tell you what,
why don't the three of us go

20:19.886 --> 20:21.955
over to Cosmo's
and get some pizza?

20:21.988 --> 20:23.490
Hey, that'll be great.

20:23.523 --> 20:25.325
Shana, would you mind
if Mikey took you home?

20:25.358 --> 20:27.293
That'd be all right.

20:27.327 --> 20:30.463
Uh, that's really nice, Zack,
but what's the catch?

20:30.497 --> 20:32.365
I've got a 10:00 curfew.

20:34.434 --> 20:38.905
See, I told you there was
nothing to worry about.

20:38.938 --> 20:41.341
Screechster, hit it!

20:41.374 --> 20:43.276
(dance music begins )

21:25.852 --> 21:27.987
( instrumental music plays )
