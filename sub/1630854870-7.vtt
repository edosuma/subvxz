WEBVTT

00:07.440 --> 00:09.409
Uh-huh.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.947
And if the opposition tries
to claim it's inadmissible,

00:14.047 --> 00:15.749
we'll be ready to counter.

00:17.617 --> 00:19.452
And they signed the affidavit?

00:19.552 --> 00:21.187
Perfect.

00:22.655 --> 00:24.357
Yeah, well...

00:24.457 --> 00:25.725
we're gonna have
to get that list

00:25.825 --> 00:30.096
in front of the judge tomorrow
ahead of the discovery.

00:30.196 --> 00:31.197
Exactly.

00:31.297 --> 00:33.600
It's a clear failure
of due process.

00:38.338 --> 00:40.040
No, I know.
I heard that, too.

00:41.508 --> 00:44.077
Listen, Ian,
let me call you right back.

00:47.480 --> 00:50.817
You know, if it wasn't for you,

00:50.917 --> 00:52.118
I don't think I'd ever eat.

00:52.218 --> 00:53.453
Ah, okay.

00:53.553 --> 00:56.456
Please...

00:56.556 --> 00:58.091
Help yourself.

00:58.191 --> 00:59.225
Mmm!

00:59.325 --> 01:01.294
I need you!
Hold on.

01:04.130 --> 01:05.398
What am I looking at?

01:05.498 --> 01:07.600
Dinner napkins.
For the wedding.

01:07.700 --> 01:09.135
It's great.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.738
- I like them.
- Which one?

01:11.838 --> 01:13.807
- You want me to pick?
- Yeah.

01:16.142 --> 01:17.944
This one.

01:18.044 --> 01:19.446
No?

01:19.546 --> 01:20.447
That one?

01:20.547 --> 01:22.082
Meh...

01:22.182 --> 01:24.584
Me too!

01:24.684 --> 01:26.152
You know what?
You're right.

01:26.252 --> 01:29.589
It is so much more fun
when we plan together.

01:33.460 --> 01:36.062
You're gonna kill it today.

01:36.162 --> 01:37.964
I know you will.

01:38.064 --> 01:40.667
- See you after!
- See ya.

02:05.925 --> 02:10.296
♪ Heaven,
I'm in heaven... ♪

02:10.396 --> 02:15.468
♪ And my heart beats so
that I can hardly speak. ♪

02:15.568 --> 02:20.640
♪ And I seem to find
the happiness I seek... ♪

02:20.740 --> 02:24.277
♪ When we're out together
dancing cheek to cheek. ♪

02:24.377 --> 02:27.447
Nnn, no singing!

02:27.547 --> 02:28.915
Do you want a yogurt parfait?

02:29.015 --> 02:30.617
Do I look familiar
to you at all?

02:30.717 --> 02:31.651
Do you have face blindness?

02:31.751 --> 02:33.520
Why would I want
a yogurt parfait?

02:33.620 --> 02:35.822
- I don't know.
- Who died?

02:35.922 --> 02:37.657
Those are from Billy.

02:37.757 --> 02:40.226
It's a rather large
floral arrangement.

02:40.326 --> 02:42.195
He must be overcompensating
for something.

02:42.295 --> 02:44.297
Oh, I assure you
that's not the case.

02:44.397 --> 02:47.000
Dancing cheek to cheek
with a prospective lover,

02:47.100 --> 02:50.203
you learn a lot, and there
is no overcompensating.

02:50.303 --> 02:51.871
You're my mother!

02:51.971 --> 02:54.174
Don't be such a prude!

02:54.274 --> 02:57.944
Unless you're in a mood because
things aren't so satisfying

02:58.044 --> 03:00.180
- with young Des?
- I'm not in a mood!

03:00.280 --> 03:02.015
I just hadn't had my coffee yet.

03:02.115 --> 03:04.484
Well, with romance
you don't need caffeine.

03:04.584 --> 03:05.818
It's its own upper!

03:05.919 --> 03:08.855
Romance doesn't live with
its mother in its adult years.

03:12.158 --> 03:14.394
It's Lucas.

03:14.494 --> 03:17.096
Hey!

03:17.197 --> 03:19.299
What?

03:19.399 --> 03:22.502
Yeah, we'll be right there.

03:22.602 --> 03:24.003
Lindsay got a death threat!

03:24.103 --> 03:25.505
Oh, God.

03:25.605 --> 03:26.673
And Lucas thinks it was you?

03:26.773 --> 03:29.242
Ha-ha.
No, he's offering us the case.

03:29.342 --> 03:31.411
Don't you think that might
make you uncomfortable, honey?

03:31.511 --> 03:32.779
No, I don't.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.080
Lindsay and I have
an understanding.

03:34.180 --> 03:36.449
- We're good.
- Hmm...

03:36.549 --> 03:37.884
Don't.

03:37.984 --> 03:40.420
I didn't say a word.

03:40.520 --> 03:43.122
Good.
Let's keep it that way.

03:47.627 --> 03:49.862
This is
a spectacular home.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.030
Yeah, it's cute.

03:51.130 --> 03:52.232
Mm-hm.

03:53.533 --> 03:55.335
What, Lucas called you too?

03:55.435 --> 03:58.204
But without damage
or a physical assault--

03:58.304 --> 04:00.006
The cops can't do anything.

04:00.106 --> 04:01.574
And you wonder why I quit.

04:01.674 --> 04:03.643
Hey, is this gonna be
too weird for you?

04:03.743 --> 04:05.845
I can give Lucas some
other recommendations.

04:05.945 --> 04:07.880
Why do you guys
keep saying this?

04:07.981 --> 04:09.616
I'm absolutely fine.

04:09.716 --> 04:10.950
I'm...

04:11.050 --> 04:12.852
Hey, thanks for coming.

04:12.952 --> 04:14.954
...Fine.

04:15.054 --> 04:16.422
Darby?

04:16.522 --> 04:19.092
Uh, what are--
what are you doing here?

04:19.192 --> 04:20.927
I called her.

04:21.027 --> 04:22.962
And them. I...

04:23.062 --> 04:24.564
I'm worried about you.

04:24.664 --> 04:28.067
I think that we need all
the help that we can get.

04:28.167 --> 04:29.369
Of course!

04:29.469 --> 04:31.738
Um, come on in.

04:31.838 --> 04:33.473
I'm gonna take a look around.

04:33.573 --> 04:36.476
Okay.
Thanks, Zane.

04:36.576 --> 04:38.678
Ugh!
You guys!

04:48.187 --> 04:49.856
These were in
the mailbox this morning

04:49.956 --> 04:51.257
in a plain envelope.

04:54.694 --> 04:58.197
These are really creepy.

04:58.298 --> 05:02.435
That's a strange mark.

05:02.535 --> 05:04.370
Who would send these
to you and why?

05:04.470 --> 05:06.506
They're just typical scare
tactics trying to distract me.

05:06.606 --> 05:08.975
- That's all.
- We don't know that for sure.

05:09.075 --> 05:11.644
We gotta take this seriously. Look...

05:11.744 --> 05:13.713
It gets worse.

05:13.813 --> 05:15.181
"We're watching you.

05:15.281 --> 05:19.652
"Drop the case
before someone gets hurt."

05:36.969 --> 05:39.038
Why would you
get a death threat?

05:39.138 --> 05:40.907
I'm first chair in a lawsuit

05:41.007 --> 05:43.476
between Onyx Point Mining Corp
and some miners.

05:43.576 --> 05:44.877
I heard about this!

05:44.977 --> 05:47.246
The miners claim that
their lungs had been impaired

05:47.347 --> 05:48.715
due to sub-par ventilation.

05:48.815 --> 05:49.816
It's horrible.

05:49.916 --> 05:51.150
In a site that's
now closed, yes.

05:51.250 --> 05:52.685
That's so admirable, Lindsay,

05:52.785 --> 05:54.320
that you're fighting
for workers' rights,

05:54.420 --> 05:56.322
especially against
a corporate giant like that.

05:56.422 --> 05:57.924
That's awesome.
Good for you.

05:58.024 --> 06:01.060
Yeah, I actually
represent Onyx Point.

06:01.160 --> 06:03.162
So, like... the bad guys?

06:03.262 --> 06:05.598
My clients are innocent
until proven otherwise.

06:05.698 --> 06:08.167
The claims are being
taken extremely seriously,

06:08.267 --> 06:11.404
but it's my job to ensure
a fair trial for everyone.

06:11.504 --> 06:14.507
Except it's not really
a fair trial, though, is it?

06:14.607 --> 06:16.743
Not when your client's been
dragging things out for months.

06:16.843 --> 06:18.945
This is so good.
I want to write it down.

06:19.045 --> 06:21.314
I'm starting research for
a future Bryn Martell novel,

06:21.414 --> 06:23.449
"The Attorney's Affliction,"
and I think that this is--

06:23.549 --> 06:25.785
Mom? Mom!
Not the time.

06:25.885 --> 06:28.354
Look,
scare tactics like these

06:28.454 --> 06:30.089
are not uncommon, unfortunately.

06:30.189 --> 06:33.126
I'm not sure any of this
is really necessary.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.261
Lindsay, you got a death threat!

06:35.361 --> 06:38.898
Okay,
it wasn't a death threat.

06:40.533 --> 06:43.903
Please,
will you take this seriously?

06:46.806 --> 06:48.808
I suppose I could talk
to my boss about hiring

06:48.908 --> 06:50.076
Victoria and Darby?

06:50.176 --> 06:52.779
Yes, thank you!

06:52.879 --> 06:54.247
Can you take the case?

06:54.347 --> 06:57.283
- Um...
- Of course.

06:57.383 --> 07:00.753
We would be happy to.

07:10.229 --> 07:13.332
Oh, Darby, Victoria,
this is Kyle Lauder,

07:13.433 --> 07:14.801
my boss and one of
the partners here.

07:14.901 --> 07:16.068
Ladies, welcome.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.404
I sincerely appreciate
your looking into this.

07:18.504 --> 07:20.039
Aren't you a famous writer?

07:20.139 --> 07:21.474
Guilty as charged!

07:21.574 --> 07:23.276
I've always wanted to say that.

07:23.376 --> 07:26.646
Well, uh, happy to
have you on the team.

07:26.746 --> 07:28.114
Ow!

07:28.214 --> 07:29.248
Rope burn.

07:29.348 --> 07:30.483
My guilty pleasure.

07:30.583 --> 07:33.519
I admire your candour.
S&M has never been my thing

07:33.619 --> 07:35.621
but I understand
it's quite a thrill.

07:35.721 --> 07:37.323
No, I...

07:37.423 --> 07:38.324
Rock climbing.

07:38.424 --> 07:40.159
- Oh!
- I'm a climber.

07:40.259 --> 07:42.228
Oh, of course!

07:42.328 --> 07:44.464
I mean,
how was I supposed to know?

07:44.564 --> 07:46.499
Hi, I'm Ian.

07:46.599 --> 07:47.767
Ian!

07:47.867 --> 07:50.303
Yes, this is my second chair
and total lifesaver,

07:50.403 --> 07:51.304
Ian Lawlin.

07:51.404 --> 07:53.105
Ian can tell you anything
you want to know.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.208
Lindsay and I
need to jump on a call,

07:55.308 --> 07:56.342
unless you need some time?

07:56.442 --> 07:57.610
No, that won't be necessary.

07:57.710 --> 07:58.644
Excuse us.

07:58.744 --> 08:01.180
Uh, let me just
grab the depositions.

08:01.280 --> 08:04.083
- Please, sit.
- Okay.

08:04.183 --> 08:07.019
Hey, uh...
you think Lindsay's okay?

08:07.119 --> 08:08.788
She'll never admit
she's rattled.

08:08.888 --> 08:10.456
You're close to her?

08:10.556 --> 08:13.593
Well, I'm often referred to
as her "work husband."

08:13.693 --> 08:15.394
It's a little inside joke.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.396
This is
a pretty sensitive case.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.198
Can you think of anyone
who would do this?

08:19.298 --> 08:21.367
Well, the miners have been
very vocal on the news.

08:21.467 --> 08:23.169
Especially Edgar Moore.

08:23.269 --> 08:24.837
He's the lead plaintiff.

08:24.937 --> 08:28.007
He claims to have developed
a respiratory issue in the mine

08:28.107 --> 08:29.308
and can't work.

08:29.408 --> 08:31.377
What does that
have to do with Lindsay?

08:31.477 --> 08:33.880
Well, lately he's been
saying that Onyx Point

08:33.980 --> 08:35.314
is delaying
so the miners suffer

08:35.414 --> 08:38.384
while their lawyer Lindsay
pays for her designer handbags

08:38.484 --> 08:41.487
with all the legal fees
she's collecting.

08:41.587 --> 08:43.022
He called her a "bottom-feeder."

08:43.122 --> 08:44.323
Where can we find him?

08:44.423 --> 08:46.025
Oh, he's been holding
a hunger strike outside

08:46.125 --> 08:48.895
Onyx Point headquarters
for days now.

08:48.995 --> 08:51.230
My fellow miners!

08:51.330 --> 08:54.767
My message!

08:54.867 --> 09:00.206
My hunger will only be satisfied
when Onyx Point

09:00.306 --> 09:02.708
takes responsibility
for their actions.

09:02.808 --> 09:05.578
Good will overcome evil!

09:07.647 --> 09:10.082
My people.

09:11.984 --> 09:16.689
Well, I guess that means
we're working for evil.

09:16.789 --> 09:18.591
Excuse me, Mr. Moore?

09:18.691 --> 09:20.192
We admire your conviction.

09:20.293 --> 09:22.094
When you're fighting tyranny,

09:22.194 --> 09:24.397
you have to use
every arrow in your quiver.

09:24.497 --> 09:26.232
- Hmm, like threatening someone?
- Huh?

09:26.332 --> 09:28.868
Lindsay Yip, the lawyer
who represents Onyx Point.

09:28.968 --> 09:30.770
Someone left
a very threatening message

09:30.870 --> 09:32.204
in her mailbox this morning.

09:32.305 --> 09:33.372
You think that was me?

09:33.472 --> 09:34.440
Well, let's just say

09:34.540 --> 09:36.242
your quiver's
looking a little light.

09:36.342 --> 09:39.312
I may question her life choices

09:39.412 --> 09:40.680
but I don't threaten anyone.

09:40.780 --> 09:44.784
I believe in non-violent
forms of protest only.

09:44.884 --> 09:47.019
I'm on your side,
Mr. Moore,

09:47.119 --> 09:49.488
but let's be real:
non-violence doesn't work.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.057
Is she always this cynical?

09:51.157 --> 09:53.225
You should see her
in the morning.

09:53.326 --> 09:56.362
I didn't threaten that lawyer.

09:56.462 --> 09:59.665
Talk to anyone; they'll
all vouch for my character,

09:59.765 --> 10:02.868
and to the fact that I haven't
stepped off this property

10:02.969 --> 10:04.236
for days.

10:05.671 --> 10:07.073
There he is!

10:10.676 --> 10:13.679
Can we get
a comment here, please?

10:16.582 --> 10:19.118
Sir, can we just--
Get in the car!

10:19.218 --> 10:20.686
Who's that?

10:20.786 --> 10:23.089
He's the CEO of Onyx Point.

10:23.189 --> 10:25.658
Bruce Reddix.
That's who you're helping.

10:25.758 --> 10:29.061
And if anyone benefits
from this, it's him.

10:29.161 --> 10:31.163
The hearing that was pushed?

10:31.263 --> 10:33.699
That was to decide
whether to admit evidence

10:33.799 --> 10:35.167
that would hurt his company.

10:35.267 --> 10:37.703
So you're saying
that Onyx Point threatened

10:37.803 --> 10:39.071
its own legal team?

10:39.171 --> 10:41.173
They're on the hook
for tens of millions of dollars

10:41.273 --> 10:44.710
if they lose this case:
what do you think?

10:44.810 --> 10:46.512
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

10:46.612 --> 10:49.382
Take care.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.950
Lindsay texted.

10:51.050 --> 10:53.719
She wants us
to swing by the house.

10:59.291 --> 11:01.460
Can someone please
talk some sense into him?

11:01.560 --> 11:02.962
He's completely overreacting.

11:03.062 --> 11:05.131
Oh, yeah, that's a lot of...

11:05.231 --> 11:06.232
weaponry...

11:06.332 --> 11:08.100
And bear spray?
Nice.

11:08.200 --> 11:09.468
I'm not overreacting, okay?

11:09.568 --> 11:10.903
I don't know why
you keep saying that.

11:11.003 --> 11:12.838
It's for protection.
Just offering options.

11:12.938 --> 11:15.307
You don't have to use them all;
you just pick one.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.009
Sure, fine. Um...

11:17.109 --> 11:19.645
I'm gonna go with
the brass knuckles.

11:19.745 --> 11:21.881
They'll go great
with my manicure.

11:23.916 --> 11:25.418
Lindsay!
Get down!

11:27.153 --> 11:31.157
Lindsay, stay down!

11:31.257 --> 11:34.126
- You okay?
- Yeah...

11:41.133 --> 11:45.204
"Lindsay, don't lose
your head over this case."

11:53.312 --> 11:56.248
So, uh, nothing on the car,
neighbours didn't see anything,

11:56.348 --> 11:57.616
and everyone on this cul-de-sac

11:57.717 --> 11:59.452
had their cameras
pointed toward the porch.

11:59.552 --> 12:01.153
Right.
Thanks, Amazon thieves.

12:01.253 --> 12:03.422
I'd recommend staying somewhere
else until we know more.

12:03.522 --> 12:04.557
Your parents?

12:04.657 --> 12:06.625
My parents moved
to Kelowna a year ago.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.295
Mine rented their place out
and moved to Italy.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.564
- It's fine, we'll get a hotel.
- No, that's not much safer.

12:11.664 --> 12:13.566
There's only one way
out of a hotel room.

12:13.666 --> 12:16.836
Okay, well, what are
our other options?

12:19.705 --> 12:21.440
You know...

12:21.540 --> 12:22.842
we have a lot of room.

12:22.942 --> 12:28.013
I've had my fair share
of run-ins with obsessed Brans.

12:28.114 --> 12:30.082
Bryn fans-- Brans?

12:30.182 --> 12:33.486
And so, our house
is a veritable fortress.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.955
That's, um,
very generous of you.

12:36.055 --> 12:38.290
Yeah, but, um...
we don't want to impose.

12:38.390 --> 12:39.458
No, it's fine.

12:39.558 --> 12:43.829
- We've got lots of... space.
- Mm-hm.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.531
It is very...

12:45.631 --> 12:47.533
safe.

12:47.633 --> 12:50.102
Yeah...

12:50.202 --> 12:51.537
- Great!
- Good!

12:51.637 --> 12:52.805
- Alright!
- Yay!

12:52.905 --> 12:54.707
- Alright, pack your bags!
- So you'll stay?

12:56.976 --> 13:01.113
Oh, Victoria,
your house is just so beautiful.

13:01.213 --> 13:02.314
Thank you.

13:02.414 --> 13:04.150
Is this an original
Robert Archambeau?

13:04.250 --> 13:07.353
Ooh, I'm impressed!
You have a very discerning eye.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.321
Ugh!

13:09.421 --> 13:11.657
Don't worry, guys.
I've got it.

13:11.757 --> 13:13.025
Oh, God, these are heavy!

13:13.125 --> 13:14.326
Could you have packed more?

13:14.426 --> 13:16.295
Sorry.

13:16.395 --> 13:18.798
Well, thank you again, Victoria.

13:18.898 --> 13:21.267
We are really grateful
for your hospitality.

13:21.367 --> 13:24.069
Nonsense.
Minha casa é a sua casa.

13:24.170 --> 13:26.872
She's been taking
Portuguese lessons from Antonio.

13:26.972 --> 13:28.140
Yes!

13:28.240 --> 13:29.975
I'm starving.
Are you?

13:30.075 --> 13:31.210
Should I order pizza for dinner?

13:31.310 --> 13:33.179
Alright,
you three kids go ahead.

13:33.279 --> 13:34.313
I have plans.

13:34.413 --> 13:36.582
The guest suite
is down the hall to the right.

13:36.682 --> 13:40.219
- Thank you!
- Make yourselves at home.

13:40.319 --> 13:42.087
Thanks, Darby.

13:43.622 --> 13:45.491
Well, wait, wait, wait!
What...

13:45.591 --> 13:47.026
Where are you going?
What plans do you have?

13:47.126 --> 13:48.527
I have a date with Billy.

13:48.627 --> 13:51.030
Well, shouldn't we tell
Lindsay what Edgar said

13:51.130 --> 13:53.165
- about Onyx Point?
- Let's wait until tomorrow.

13:53.265 --> 13:55.668
Besides, I'm gonna
do a little follow-up digging

13:55.768 --> 13:57.002
on my date tonight.

13:57.102 --> 14:01.040
I found out where the CEO
of Onyx Point is dining...

14:05.144 --> 14:07.413
I finally
got to the bookstore.

14:07.513 --> 14:09.815
I got up to the podium
a nervous wreck...

14:09.915 --> 14:10.850
And?

14:10.950 --> 14:13.419
I improvised
an entirely new chapter

14:13.519 --> 14:16.088
and put it in my next book.

14:16.188 --> 14:17.990
That's fantastic.

14:18.090 --> 14:20.125
Yeah.

14:20.226 --> 14:22.061
Oh, God, you won't believe this!

14:22.161 --> 14:24.897
A suspect for a new
Spencer Sisters case

14:24.997 --> 14:26.265
that I told you about...

14:26.365 --> 14:29.368
is sitting right over there.

14:29.468 --> 14:31.770
It's crazy!

14:31.871 --> 14:35.174
You're telling me that you just
happened to make a reservation

14:35.274 --> 14:39.712
at a restaurant where a suspect
in one of your cases turns up?

14:39.812 --> 14:41.213
Am I that obvious?

14:41.313 --> 14:44.216
- Hmm...
- Are you offended?

14:44.316 --> 14:45.784
Well...

14:45.885 --> 14:48.754
Who doesn't like mixing business
with pleasure from time to time?

14:48.854 --> 14:50.689
Alright, then.

14:50.789 --> 14:52.458
What'd you say
his name was again?

14:52.558 --> 14:54.827
Bruce Reddix.

14:58.330 --> 14:59.932
What are you doing?

15:00.032 --> 15:04.003
Improvising.

15:04.103 --> 15:05.838
Follow my lead.

15:05.938 --> 15:09.408
Okay!

15:09.508 --> 15:11.076
Mr. Reddix?

15:11.176 --> 15:12.444
Uh, sorry to interrupt.

15:12.544 --> 15:15.581
That talk you did at the
Geologists' Conference in Prague

15:15.681 --> 15:17.316
on the decarbonization
of heavy industry?

15:17.416 --> 15:19.418
Just... muah!

15:19.518 --> 15:20.953
Frank Shelty, Goldcore.

15:21.053 --> 15:22.354
We had drinks afterward.

15:22.454 --> 15:24.823
Ah, yes, of course!
Great to see you again.

15:24.924 --> 15:27.159
You know, given everything
that's been in the news

15:27.259 --> 15:29.228
about Onyx Point lately, uh,

15:29.328 --> 15:33.632
you should really meet my VP
of Stakeholder Relations,

15:33.732 --> 15:35.267
Nancy Cloke.

15:35.367 --> 15:37.303
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Reddix.

15:38.804 --> 15:41.707
Ah!
Le Québec, c'est à moi!

15:41.807 --> 15:43.676
Which you'd understand
if you ever stayed awake

15:43.776 --> 15:45.277
- during French class.
- Whatever.

15:45.377 --> 15:46.845
That was a lucky roll.

15:46.946 --> 15:48.847
Ah, some would say luck,
some would say skill.

15:48.948 --> 15:51.450
It's not luck or skill.
It's math.

15:51.550 --> 15:52.785
Some would say math.

15:52.885 --> 15:54.653
Oh no, it's his turn
'cause he was-- oh.

15:54.753 --> 15:55.521
Mm-hm!

15:57.523 --> 15:59.391
Hey, Ian.
Boop!

15:59.491 --> 16:03.462
Nope, it's not a bad time.
I'm literally doing nothing.

16:03.562 --> 16:06.031
Goodnight, you two.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.499
Uh-huh!

16:07.599 --> 16:09.702
Okay...

16:09.802 --> 16:10.970
How do you say in French,

16:11.070 --> 16:13.105
"You're going down
in flames, buddy"?

16:13.205 --> 16:15.207
Ready?

16:15.307 --> 16:17.509
Ah!
Zut alors!

16:18.644 --> 16:21.013
Nancy here worked her magic

16:21.113 --> 16:23.382
when we had
that little silicosis incident

16:23.482 --> 16:24.883
in our Westonia cobalt mine.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.553
- I don't recall hearing that.
- Exactly!

16:29.121 --> 16:30.889
Speaking of which, Bruce,

16:30.990 --> 16:34.026
all the bad press that
Onyx Point has been getting,

16:34.126 --> 16:35.761
it's gotta be bad
for your brand.

16:35.861 --> 16:37.029
You got that right.

16:37.129 --> 16:39.098
And our shareholders
are breathing down our necks.

16:39.198 --> 16:41.333
Hmm, how is
the case progressing?

16:41.433 --> 16:45.237
Get this: our lead counsel
is receiving death threats.

16:45.337 --> 16:46.905
That's awful.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.074
- Who would do that?
- We don't know yet.

16:49.174 --> 16:50.376
But everything's on hold.

16:50.476 --> 16:52.878
Our discovery hearing
got pushed back because of it.

16:52.978 --> 16:55.014
Well, that's...
that's such a shame.

16:55.114 --> 16:56.382
In cases like this,

16:56.482 --> 16:59.351
it's best to get it over with
as fast as possible.

16:59.451 --> 17:01.620
I mean, there's no bad press

17:01.720 --> 17:04.523
for a story
no one's heard, right?

17:04.623 --> 17:05.858
You know what?

17:05.958 --> 17:08.627
I'm really not at liberty
to discuss the case any further.

17:08.727 --> 17:11.897
It was a pleasure meeting you.

17:11.997 --> 17:16.201
Good to see you again.

17:16.301 --> 17:18.337
Bye, Bruce!

17:23.175 --> 17:25.310
Billy West,

17:25.411 --> 17:28.380
you are a man of
so many surprises.

17:37.389 --> 17:38.390
Boom!

17:38.490 --> 17:40.125
Count 'em and weep.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.127
Don't cry too hard
over Argentina,

17:42.227 --> 17:43.796
but you're done, Collins.

17:43.896 --> 17:46.398
World domination is mine!

17:46.498 --> 17:48.267
Careful, Darbs.
Your nerd is showing.

17:48.367 --> 17:50.302
Hmm!

17:50.402 --> 17:52.304
What if we play
something simpler?

17:52.404 --> 17:53.605
Oh, something you could win?

17:53.705 --> 17:56.475
Yes, exactly.
Something that I can win.

17:56.575 --> 17:57.709
Poker?

17:57.810 --> 17:58.777
Old Maid?

17:58.877 --> 18:01.914
What did you just call me?

18:02.014 --> 18:05.951
Prepare to empty your wallet.

18:06.051 --> 18:10.089
Reminds me of that time that we
rented the cabin in Algonquin.

18:10.189 --> 18:12.157
Right after graduation.

18:12.257 --> 18:14.460
Remember it rained
the entire weekend?

18:14.560 --> 18:15.461
Yeah.

18:15.561 --> 18:17.629
We didn't even go in the lake!

18:17.729 --> 18:19.865
No, we did the one time.

18:19.965 --> 18:23.702
Remember, we went down,
and it was just the two of us.

18:23.802 --> 18:25.037
It was really quiet.

18:25.137 --> 18:29.641
The water was, like,
incredibly warm and we...

18:29.741 --> 18:32.544
I remember.

18:32.644 --> 18:34.646
It was beautiful.

18:43.589 --> 18:45.457
You know what?

18:45.557 --> 18:47.126
I'm kind of tired.

18:47.226 --> 18:48.393
I should go to bed.

18:48.494 --> 18:50.362
Yeah.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.030
No, same.

18:52.131 --> 18:54.233
- I've got rounds in the morning.
- Oh, early?

18:54.333 --> 18:55.634
Yeah.

18:55.734 --> 18:57.603
- Alright, I'll see ya.
- Sleep well.

18:57.703 --> 19:00.472
Night.

19:13.952 --> 19:16.522
Oof.

19:43.782 --> 19:45.751
Morning.
Good morning!

19:45.851 --> 19:47.119
Oh...

19:47.219 --> 19:48.587
Oh, uh, Darby, I...

19:48.687 --> 19:50.255
I finished the cereal.

19:50.355 --> 19:51.957
Oh.

19:52.057 --> 19:53.992
That's okay.
I'll just grab a bagel.

19:54.092 --> 19:56.828
Oh, uh, I think
I might've taken the last one.

19:56.929 --> 19:58.497
Early bird
gets the worm!

19:58.597 --> 20:02.067
Okay.
Good thing I don't like worms.

20:02.167 --> 20:03.735
I'm sorry,
that's not your cup, honey.

20:03.835 --> 20:04.803
What?
What do you mean?

20:04.903 --> 20:05.804
Everyone has one.

20:05.904 --> 20:07.206
Except me.

20:07.306 --> 20:10.275
Oh my God.
Is that my mother's robe?

20:10.375 --> 20:13.912
If the universe is kind,
you are wearing underwear.

20:14.012 --> 20:15.881
- Take my seat, babe.
- Babe?

20:15.981 --> 20:18.083
The universe may
not be kind, but I am.

20:18.183 --> 20:19.618
So, I'll stand.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.720
We had the most
amazing dinner last night.

20:21.820 --> 20:23.722
We ran into Bruce Reddix.

20:23.822 --> 20:26.258
And he didn't seem
that upset that the threats

20:26.358 --> 20:28.493
pushed back the upcoming
discovery hearing.

20:28.594 --> 20:30.862
I'm sorry,
you spoke to my client?

20:30.963 --> 20:32.998
Come on, Lindsay.
They're just doing their jobs.

20:33.098 --> 20:34.933
They're looking into every lead
so they can protect you.

20:35.033 --> 20:36.435
Well, then look
where it makes sense.

20:36.535 --> 20:38.804
You don't think that
the CEO of a mining company

20:38.904 --> 20:40.505
who's on the hook
for millions of dollars

20:40.606 --> 20:42.407
is capable of hurting you
to protect himself?

20:42.507 --> 20:44.443
No, because that's not
what's happening here.

20:44.543 --> 20:46.111
Okay, we're still waiting
on evidence, reports,

20:46.211 --> 20:47.779
- witness accounts--
- Come on, Lindsay!

20:47.879 --> 20:49.481
He's beholden to
his shareholders

20:49.581 --> 20:50.716
and his bottom line.
That's it.

20:50.816 --> 20:52.050
Okay, guys!

20:52.150 --> 20:53.785
I can't believe
you're bringing this up again!

20:53.885 --> 20:55.153
Since day one
you have always assumed

20:55.254 --> 20:56.622
that my client is guilty.

20:56.722 --> 20:58.857
Everyone is entitled to a
fair trial, even a corporation.

20:58.957 --> 21:01.526
Don't you think that maybe
you're just on the wrong side?

21:01.627 --> 21:02.728
Excuse me?

21:02.828 --> 21:05.030
I don't know where you
draw the line, defending them.

21:05.130 --> 21:07.933
The line is right here.
Between us.

21:08.033 --> 21:10.602
And you are clearly
not on my side.

21:24.583 --> 21:28.453
- Go, go!
- What?

21:28.553 --> 21:30.589
It's Bruce Reddix!
You have to go talk to him.

21:30.689 --> 21:31.923
Me?!
Why me?

21:32.024 --> 21:34.960
Well, because he'll recognize me
from dinner yesterday.

21:35.060 --> 21:37.529
We need to test the theory
that he delayed the case.

21:37.629 --> 21:39.464
- What am I supposed to say?
- I don't know!

21:39.564 --> 21:41.867
Act like, uh...
you're a PR person.

21:41.967 --> 21:43.802
- Okay?
- A disguise?

21:43.902 --> 21:45.771
- Yes!
- Mom, I'm not you!

21:45.871 --> 21:47.172
It's fun.
Go!

21:47.272 --> 21:49.541
- Ugh!
- Go!

21:49.641 --> 21:52.444
- Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up!
- Okay, okay!

21:57.082 --> 21:59.651
Oh my God,
I am so sorry, sir!

21:59.751 --> 22:01.286
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

22:01.386 --> 22:02.321
Wait a second!

22:02.421 --> 22:04.389
You're the CEO of
Onyx Point, right?

22:04.489 --> 22:07.059
- Who are you?
- I'm Kinsey Stiles.

22:07.159 --> 22:10.028
I'm the junior rep
for your PR firm.

22:10.128 --> 22:13.231
Oh my God, you must be so mad
about the rumour that Onyx Point

22:13.332 --> 22:16.201
threatened Lindsay Yip just
to get the discovery delayed!

22:16.301 --> 22:18.203
I'll meet you two in the car.

22:18.303 --> 22:19.338
Excuse me, what?

22:19.438 --> 22:21.773
You haven't heard?
It's all over my newsfeed.

22:21.873 --> 22:24.242
"Onyx Point has the most
to gain from a delay

22:24.343 --> 22:25.477
"and will stop at nothing."

22:25.577 --> 22:27.012
- That's preposterous!
- Oh my God, I know!

22:27.112 --> 22:28.747
We'd be fools
to do that to Lindsay!

22:28.847 --> 22:30.415
She's consistently steered us
in the best direction.

22:30.515 --> 22:32.284
Also, I just got off
the phone with my board,

22:32.384 --> 22:33.952
and they want this case
dealt with quickly.

22:34.052 --> 22:35.554
- No more delays!
- Oh my God, totally.

22:35.654 --> 22:37.622
I'll spread the word.

22:42.027 --> 22:44.262
So, Onyx Point
isn't behind the delay?

22:44.363 --> 22:46.565
- I think Bruce is innocent.
- So what do we do now?

22:46.665 --> 22:48.233
You should go repair
things with Lindsay.

22:48.333 --> 22:49.901
I'll head to Lindsay
and Lucas's house

22:50.001 --> 22:51.370
in case the cops
missed anything.

22:51.470 --> 22:52.437
Okay, divide and conquer.

22:52.537 --> 22:55.340
- Yeah.
- Hair clip.

23:02.381 --> 23:04.249
I thought
you'd be at work.

23:04.349 --> 23:08.153
No, I had a teaching
rotation that ended early.

23:10.889 --> 23:12.624
How's Lindsay?

23:12.724 --> 23:14.793
You haven't spoken to her
since your fight?

23:14.893 --> 23:16.928
No.

23:17.028 --> 23:20.399
No, to be honest, things are...

23:20.499 --> 23:23.502
They're a little bit
strained right now.

23:27.706 --> 23:31.476
- What is it?
- Well...

23:31.576 --> 23:33.445
If this photo was
taken from the street,

23:33.545 --> 23:34.813
you'd see the fence in it.

23:34.913 --> 23:37.849
It would have to have been
taken from higher up, right?

23:37.949 --> 23:39.651
Come on.

23:39.751 --> 23:42.220
- Where?
- Follow me.

23:44.890 --> 23:46.525
This house has
the perfect vantage point

23:46.625 --> 23:48.393
for shots of your kitchen.

23:48.493 --> 23:49.795
Yeah?

23:49.895 --> 23:52.798
Well, maybe we can
schedule a viewing.

23:52.898 --> 23:54.533
And if we're lucky,

23:54.633 --> 23:58.570
maybe the photographer
left something behind.

23:58.670 --> 23:59.938
- Nice.
- Yeah!

24:00.038 --> 24:02.207
So we're going in?
Oh, yeah.

24:02.307 --> 24:05.410
Well, good thing they moved out.

24:05.510 --> 24:07.479
Nice.

24:07.579 --> 24:09.314
Well, this is definitely
a Darby experience.

24:09.414 --> 24:12.484
What's that supposed to mean?

24:20.058 --> 24:25.163
Look, the photo was taken
from this spot exactly.

24:25.263 --> 24:30.302
I don't see anything here
that looks like a lead.

24:30.402 --> 24:32.871
Ah!

24:32.971 --> 24:35.040
Ugh!

24:35.140 --> 24:37.142
Uh, that's a...

24:37.242 --> 24:39.711
- That's a problem.
- Mm-hm.

24:43.815 --> 24:47.552
It's locked!

24:47.652 --> 24:49.488
My phone's in your kitchen!

24:49.588 --> 24:51.957
I-I don't have mine either.
I'm sorry.

24:52.057 --> 24:56.127
Okay!
So, got any ideas?

25:07.105 --> 25:09.140
Well, it looks
like you've been busy!

25:09.241 --> 25:10.509
Oh, I...

25:10.609 --> 25:12.544
I had to do something
with my hands.

25:12.644 --> 25:14.012
Hmm.

25:14.112 --> 25:16.014
Mmm!

25:16.114 --> 25:19.017
Yeah, I really wish you two
hadn't spoken to my client.

25:19.117 --> 25:21.019
Yeah, we're sorry.

25:21.119 --> 25:24.689
We were just trying to find out
who is behind the threats.

25:24.789 --> 25:26.057
If it's any consolation,

25:26.157 --> 25:29.060
we don't think
that Bruce is responsible.

25:31.730 --> 25:33.732
Oh my God, that looks so good.

25:33.832 --> 25:35.600
I have some ice cream.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.369
Mmm, that would be perfect.

25:39.070 --> 25:41.206
I get that
she wants to make partner.

25:41.306 --> 25:42.340
She deserves it.

25:42.440 --> 25:43.542
Nobody works
harder than Lindsay.

25:43.642 --> 25:46.545
But is it really worth
risking her life over?

25:46.645 --> 25:48.446
Isn't that her choice to make?

25:48.547 --> 25:50.115
Is it?

25:50.215 --> 25:51.750
We're about to get married.

25:51.850 --> 25:53.552
I thought we were
supposed to be a team.

25:53.652 --> 25:57.055
What if someone
who had killed someone

25:57.155 --> 26:00.859
came into your ER
and needed medical attention?

26:00.959 --> 26:03.228
- Would you treat them?
- Of course.

26:03.328 --> 26:05.564
Even if there was
danger involved?

26:05.664 --> 26:08.066
Or a death threat?

26:08.166 --> 26:09.568
You'd still do it!

26:09.668 --> 26:11.069
Admit it.

26:11.169 --> 26:12.637
You would!

26:12.737 --> 26:14.205
Yeah, I would.

26:14.306 --> 26:16.775
So...?

26:16.875 --> 26:18.944
Wow.

26:19.044 --> 26:22.147
So, yeah,
I'm a jackass, aren't I?

26:22.247 --> 26:23.715
No, you're not a jackass.

26:23.815 --> 26:26.952
You just care about her a lot,
and I think your feelings

26:27.052 --> 26:29.154
are getting in the way
of you being able to see it

26:29.254 --> 26:31.656
from her side.

26:31.756 --> 26:32.991
Thanks, Darby.

26:34.926 --> 26:37.896
You're a... good friend.

26:37.996 --> 26:41.099
Hey!
I told you to stay off of here!

26:41.199 --> 26:43.301
Oh!
Dr. Collins?

26:43.401 --> 26:45.971
From across the street, right?
What are you doing up here?

26:46.071 --> 26:48.640
Someone took photos
of Lindsay from up here and--

26:48.740 --> 26:49.975
What?

26:50.075 --> 26:51.276
We're looking for clues.

26:51.376 --> 26:53.445
Oh my God!

26:53.545 --> 26:55.614
I was doing a showing last week,

26:55.714 --> 26:57.582
and I found a man
lurking up here.

26:57.682 --> 26:58.783
You did?

26:58.883 --> 27:00.285
A real loser
with a bucket hat.

27:00.385 --> 27:02.520
- Did you get his name?
- No, but you know what?

27:02.621 --> 27:07.759
The guy did drop
something when he ran off.

27:07.859 --> 27:09.427
This.

27:11.463 --> 27:14.399
This is a 77-millimetre
lens cap.

27:14.499 --> 27:16.835
I did a rotation
in surveillance on the force.

27:16.935 --> 27:17.869
So?

27:17.969 --> 27:20.038
So, I bet the camera store

27:20.138 --> 27:22.507
doesn't replace
these very often.

27:22.607 --> 27:25.543
Now, that is a good lead!

27:29.147 --> 27:30.315
No sign of him.

27:30.415 --> 27:32.517
You got this card
from the camera store clerk?

27:32.617 --> 27:34.619
As soon as I handed over
the lens cap and mentioned

27:34.719 --> 27:36.988
the bucket hat, she knew
exactly who I was talking about.

27:37.088 --> 27:39.357
Apparently he used that
to try to pick her up.

27:39.457 --> 27:41.059
Eww.

27:41.159 --> 27:42.360
What is that?

27:42.460 --> 27:43.595
Chips.
You want some?

27:43.695 --> 27:45.697
- You can't eat that in my car!
- What?

27:45.797 --> 27:47.432
It's a stakeout.
We need snacks.

27:47.532 --> 27:50.368
This is a Maserati,
not a multiplex.

27:50.468 --> 27:52.003
Eat 'em outside there!

27:52.103 --> 27:53.338
He'll see me!

27:53.438 --> 27:55.674
What do you not understand
about the concept of a stakeout?

27:55.774 --> 27:57.375
Well, then wipe your hands off.

27:57.475 --> 27:58.910
I don't want your
greasy fingerprints

27:59.010 --> 28:00.712
all over my leather upholstery.

28:00.812 --> 28:01.846
They're not greasy!

28:01.946 --> 28:03.381
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

28:03.481 --> 28:04.883
Someone's coming!

28:04.983 --> 28:08.053
Oh my gosh!

28:08.153 --> 28:09.854
Oh my God, bucket hat!

28:09.954 --> 28:11.389
Bucket hat!
Let's go!

28:11.489 --> 28:13.892
Go, go, go!

28:13.992 --> 28:15.760
Hey!

28:15.860 --> 28:16.861
Hey!

28:16.961 --> 28:18.830
- Nope!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

28:18.930 --> 28:20.899
Okay, okay, okay, okay!
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me!

28:20.999 --> 28:22.200
Why would we want to hurt you?

28:22.300 --> 28:24.469
In my line of work, I see
a couple of women coming at me,

28:24.569 --> 28:27.105
it's usually followed by
a high heeled shoe to the head.

28:27.205 --> 28:28.206
Sometimes two.

28:28.306 --> 28:29.541
You took photos of our client.

28:29.641 --> 28:32.177
You threw a brick through
her window with a headless doll,

28:32.277 --> 28:35.046
which is not only tasteless
but a criminal offence.

28:35.146 --> 28:36.414
Are you chicks new?

28:36.514 --> 28:37.982
PIs don't engage.

28:38.083 --> 28:41.486
This woman's life is at risk.

28:41.586 --> 28:43.588
Who told you to
take these photos?

28:43.688 --> 28:45.757
Well, I wouldn't be much of a PI

28:45.857 --> 28:47.926
if I sold out my client,
would I?

28:48.026 --> 28:50.095
But...

28:52.530 --> 28:55.333
Ugh!
God!

28:58.403 --> 29:00.905
Look, truth is
I don't know who hired me.

29:01.005 --> 29:02.807
I answered a call
from an unlisted number.

29:02.907 --> 29:04.909
They gave me a description
of Erin Brockovich there

29:05.009 --> 29:07.145
and her general whereabouts, and
then I trailed her for a week.

29:07.245 --> 29:09.013
And then you put
the photos in her mailbox?

29:09.114 --> 29:11.616
No, and then
I uploaded them to a USB key,

29:11.716 --> 29:15.120
and I taped it under a bench
in St. Lawrence Park.

29:15.220 --> 29:17.088
That last one was
for free, sugar.

29:17.188 --> 29:19.090
Ugh!

29:19.190 --> 29:21.292
I have a sugar intolerance.

29:21.392 --> 29:22.694
Email us a picture
of that bench.

29:22.794 --> 29:24.829
We'll send you the address.

29:24.929 --> 29:26.765
Yes.

29:26.865 --> 29:28.299
Well, that didn't work.

29:28.399 --> 29:29.667
But good thing
you're of a generation

29:29.768 --> 29:30.969
that still carries cash.

29:31.069 --> 29:33.838
Well as Bryn Martell says,
"Everyone has a price."

29:33.938 --> 29:37.542
Mom, you can't attribute
every popular saying to Bryn.

29:37.642 --> 29:40.979
What can I say?
She's insightful.

29:46.417 --> 29:49.687
It's amazing.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.756
Mmm!

29:51.856 --> 29:54.993
Oh, hey!
Um, dinner's almost ready.

29:55.093 --> 29:56.661
- Oh, good!
- Oh, wow!

29:56.761 --> 29:58.696
Yeah, it was
the least that we could do

29:58.797 --> 30:00.398
for opening up your home to us.

30:00.498 --> 30:03.735
Yeah, and, uh, helping us
work through our disagreement.

30:03.835 --> 30:05.170
Any time.

30:05.270 --> 30:06.504
So, guess what?

30:06.604 --> 30:09.174
It was a PI who took
those pictures of you.

30:09.274 --> 30:12.477
He doesn't know who hired him,
but he saved them to a USB

30:12.577 --> 30:15.046
and taped them under
a bench in St. Lawrence Park.

30:15.146 --> 30:17.382
And here is a picture
he gave us.

30:17.482 --> 30:19.484
See?

30:20.952 --> 30:23.588
Who's that?

30:23.688 --> 30:26.357
We were thinking, does this
bench mean anything to you?

30:26.457 --> 30:29.027
Or is it tied to
the miners in some way?

30:29.127 --> 30:30.528
No, no, I'm...

30:30.628 --> 30:32.664
Nothing comes to mind.

30:32.764 --> 30:35.333
- Hmm.
- Well, look who I found!

30:35.433 --> 30:36.835
Des!

30:36.935 --> 30:38.770
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry.

30:38.870 --> 30:40.505
I totally forgot about our date.

30:40.605 --> 30:42.407
I was with my mom.
We were on a case.

30:42.507 --> 30:43.675
No, it's-- it's okay.

30:43.775 --> 30:46.144
Um, I was just concerned
when you didn't respond.

30:46.244 --> 30:47.245
I'm okay.

30:47.345 --> 30:49.714
Well, do you
want to stay for dinner?

30:49.814 --> 30:51.216
Uh, uh...

30:51.316 --> 30:52.217
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

30:52.317 --> 30:53.351
Mm-hm!

30:53.451 --> 30:55.353
I'd love to,
but I-I gotta make the drive

30:55.453 --> 30:56.521
back to the vineyard.

30:56.621 --> 30:59.090
Ah, that's too bad.
Maybe next time.

30:59.190 --> 31:01.626
Des, no, we insist!
We made lots.

31:01.726 --> 31:03.795
Plus, you gotta fill us in
on you've been up to

31:03.895 --> 31:04.762
since high school!

31:04.863 --> 31:07.599
I mean, looks like a lot!
Chin-ups, maybe?

31:07.699 --> 31:09.434
- Wow!
- I know.

31:09.534 --> 31:10.735
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

31:10.835 --> 31:12.203
- Yeah, let's do it.
- Yeah, come on!

31:12.303 --> 31:13.905
It's gonna
be so much fun!

31:15.540 --> 31:17.141
- Were you burnt?
- Aww.

31:19.143 --> 31:21.312
We love that story...

31:21.412 --> 31:22.914
So, how'd you and Darby
reconnect?

31:23.014 --> 31:25.984
Oh.
Um, pretty randomly, actually.

31:26.084 --> 31:27.685
We had a situation
at the vineyard

31:27.785 --> 31:30.588
so we hired the Spencer Sisters
to take care of it.

31:30.688 --> 31:32.557
And, admittedly,

31:32.657 --> 31:35.793
I had a pretty big crush
on Darby in high school.

31:35.894 --> 31:38.062
Oh.
Didn't know that.

31:38.162 --> 31:39.664
You know,
probably for the best.

31:39.764 --> 31:41.766
To be fair,
I don't think many people

31:41.866 --> 31:43.201
knew I existed in high school.

31:43.301 --> 31:44.669
Ohh...

31:44.769 --> 31:46.504
Well, I mean, look at you now!

31:46.604 --> 31:48.640
A brilliant winemaker
in our midst.

31:48.740 --> 31:49.941
Yes!

31:50.041 --> 31:51.809
- Come on.
- Oh, with an empty glass!

31:51.910 --> 31:53.912
Oh, thank you.
Oh, I'm-- I'm okay, Victoria.

31:54.012 --> 31:55.146
I gotta drive.

31:55.246 --> 31:57.115
In fact,
I should probably head back.

31:57.215 --> 31:58.449
Shall we try again?

31:58.549 --> 31:59.751
Dinner for two tomorrow?

31:59.851 --> 32:00.752
- Definitely.
- Yeah?

32:00.852 --> 32:02.520
- Mm-hm.
- Okay.

32:02.620 --> 32:06.824
She's not still working for you,
though, right?

32:06.925 --> 32:11.195
You don't want HR
to get involved!

32:14.065 --> 32:18.569
Hey, um, we haven't even chosen
our wine for our wedding yet.

32:18.670 --> 32:20.338
We should
schedule a tasting.

32:20.438 --> 32:23.107
I have a brilliant
barrel select Pinot Noir

32:23.207 --> 32:24.442
that I think you'll both love.

32:24.542 --> 32:26.244
Oh, mmm, fab!
Let's-- let's do that.

32:26.344 --> 32:27.278
Yeah?

32:27.378 --> 32:28.880
I have some
brochures in the truck

32:28.980 --> 32:30.481
- if you wanna walk me out?
- Sure.

32:30.581 --> 32:31.783
Thank you so much, Victoria,

32:31.883 --> 32:33.318
and I will see you tomorrow.

32:33.418 --> 32:34.452
- Night.
- Good night.

32:34.552 --> 32:37.722
Right this way, Des.

32:37.822 --> 32:39.090
Um...

32:39.190 --> 32:41.526
I think we need more wine.

32:47.165 --> 32:50.101
Sorry, I... hope this
wasn't too awkward.

32:50.201 --> 32:52.370
No.
No, it was not awkward at all.

32:52.470 --> 32:53.604
No.

32:53.705 --> 32:55.807
It was a little bit awkward.

32:55.907 --> 32:57.041
We're okay?

32:57.141 --> 32:58.576
- We're good.
- Okay.

32:58.676 --> 33:00.511
Okay, he used to wear headgear

33:00.611 --> 33:03.448
and now he could talk me
into a Ponzi scheme.

33:03.548 --> 33:05.216
What a glow-up.

33:07.752 --> 33:09.754
Oh, work.

33:09.854 --> 33:11.456
Hey, Kyle.

33:11.556 --> 33:12.623
What?!

33:12.724 --> 33:15.693
No, I-I--
I would never have done--

33:15.793 --> 33:16.794
Everything okay?

33:16.894 --> 33:17.996
No, no.
No, no, no, no.

33:18.096 --> 33:19.797
Listen, you have to
give me another chance.

33:19.897 --> 33:24.168
But these are my clients.
You can't do this.

33:24.268 --> 33:26.637
What happened?
What's wrong?

33:26.738 --> 33:28.873
Kyle said
that he found some errors

33:28.973 --> 33:32.510
in some recent report filings,
but I triple-check everything.

33:32.610 --> 33:35.646
At least I-I thought I did.

33:35.747 --> 33:38.483
He says it's over.

33:38.583 --> 33:41.285
I'm off the case.

33:43.421 --> 33:46.724
Lindsay!

33:46.824 --> 33:48.760
Lindsay!
Lindsay...

33:53.498 --> 33:55.800
Come in!

33:55.900 --> 33:57.201
Darby, hi.

33:57.301 --> 33:59.837
Um, I just wanted
to say goodbye.

33:59.937 --> 34:02.440
Oh, goodbye?

34:02.540 --> 34:03.875
What for?

34:03.975 --> 34:06.544
Well, if I'm not on the case,
then there's no threat, right?

34:06.644 --> 34:09.180
But we never found out
who was behind it.

34:09.280 --> 34:11.382
Yeah, well,
it doesn't matter anymore.

34:12.817 --> 34:15.486
Sometimes you don't
have that much power.

34:15.586 --> 34:17.822
It's funny, but I really thought

34:17.922 --> 34:19.957
this case was
gonna make my career.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.593
You know, sometimes
I find you really intimidating.

34:22.693 --> 34:23.895
What?

34:23.995 --> 34:28.366
You're always in control
and so put together and smart.

34:28.466 --> 34:34.005
It's inspiring and terrifying, simultaneously.

34:34.105 --> 34:37.341
But right now,
you're neither of those things.

34:37.442 --> 34:38.643
Excuse me?

34:38.743 --> 34:42.580
The Lindsay that I know
wouldn't take this lying down.

34:42.680 --> 34:44.849
She would fight!

34:44.949 --> 34:47.185
What can I even do?

34:47.285 --> 34:49.687
Someone has been
trying to get you off this case

34:49.787 --> 34:51.522
the entire time.

34:51.622 --> 34:56.060
Are you just gonna let them win?

34:56.160 --> 34:57.295
No!

34:57.395 --> 34:59.464
I have worked so hard
for that firm.

34:59.564 --> 35:00.598
Mm-hm?

35:00.698 --> 35:02.033
And this would be
my first mistake.

35:02.133 --> 35:03.534
I mean, it's completely unfair.

35:03.634 --> 35:04.602
Yes, exactly!

35:04.702 --> 35:06.437
And Kyle could've
stood up for me more.

35:06.537 --> 35:07.538
Mm-hm.

35:07.638 --> 35:09.107
You know, Ian overheard
him complaining

35:09.207 --> 35:12.110
that he had to give "the woman"
the position over his nephew.

35:12.210 --> 35:13.744
Ugh!

35:13.845 --> 35:15.780
Do you think Kyle's
punishing me for that?

35:15.880 --> 35:18.483
I don't know,
but we're gonna find out.

35:18.583 --> 35:20.251
We're gonna
get you your case back

35:20.351 --> 35:23.688
so that you can make partner
in that nasty little boys club

35:23.788 --> 35:26.924
and defend
the evil mining company.

35:27.024 --> 35:29.660
The Spencer Sisters have
a perfect track record so far,

35:29.760 --> 35:31.696
and we are not
about to give that up.

35:31.796 --> 35:32.897
Well...

35:32.997 --> 35:38.236
Don't love the word
"evil," but...

35:38.336 --> 35:40.438
thank you.

35:43.808 --> 35:45.343
So here's
what we know, Kyle.

35:45.443 --> 35:48.312
Someone left a USB key full
of creepy photos of Lindsay

35:48.412 --> 35:49.947
taped under a park bench.

35:50.047 --> 35:52.383
Right next to
the Ascend Climbing Gym,

35:52.483 --> 35:54.152
of which you are a member.

35:54.252 --> 35:55.653
Wait, hold on...

35:55.753 --> 35:57.588
You think I did this
to my own employee?

35:57.688 --> 35:58.756
Well, why not?

35:58.856 --> 36:00.925
Sine you felt pressured
to hire her.

36:01.025 --> 36:02.193
Pressured?

36:02.293 --> 36:03.761
I was never pressured
into hiring Lindsay.

36:03.861 --> 36:04.896
Who told you that?

36:04.996 --> 36:06.397
Ian told Lindsay
that you wanted

36:06.497 --> 36:08.299
to hire your nephew instead.

36:08.399 --> 36:10.301
Ezra?

36:10.401 --> 36:12.637
Well, yes, he interviewed.

36:12.737 --> 36:15.806
But it was just a formality
to satisfy my brother.

36:15.907 --> 36:18.109
Ezra, bless him,
wants to be an actor.

36:18.209 --> 36:19.810
What about kicking
Lindsay off the team

36:19.911 --> 36:21.412
because of her mistake?

36:21.512 --> 36:24.115
Lindsay left the most important
witness off the testimony list.

36:24.215 --> 36:26.484
We wouldn't have been
able to call him at trial.

36:26.584 --> 36:30.888
Also, she was supposed to file
for Comparative Negligence,

36:30.988 --> 36:33.958
but she wrote
"Criminal Negligence."

36:34.058 --> 36:36.527
Hmm!
If Ian hadn't caught it,

36:36.627 --> 36:39.096
we would have ended up
in criminal court.

36:39.197 --> 36:42.833
Wait a minute--
you said Ian gave you this?

36:45.636 --> 36:47.505
Ian!

36:47.605 --> 36:49.473
Hi!

36:49.574 --> 36:51.008
So sad about Lindsay.

36:51.108 --> 36:52.543
Mm.

36:52.643 --> 36:54.478
The case won't be
the same without her.

36:54.579 --> 36:56.347
No, but it's better
for you, right?

36:56.447 --> 36:57.682
A high-profile case like this,

36:57.782 --> 37:00.017
that puts you next in line
for partner, doesn't it?

37:00.117 --> 37:01.152
Oh, no, no, no, I'm--

37:01.252 --> 37:02.720
I'm just stepping in
for the client.

37:02.820 --> 37:04.589
And, of course,
to honour Lindsay's great work.

37:04.689 --> 37:05.990
She did do great work.

37:06.090 --> 37:07.992
But Victoria
spotted something funny

37:08.092 --> 37:09.660
about the error pages you found.

37:09.760 --> 37:11.862
It seems like
they were printed

37:11.963 --> 37:15.233
on a different printer than
the rest of Lindsay's documents.

37:15.333 --> 37:16.200
So?

37:16.300 --> 37:17.702
There are printers
all over this place.

37:17.802 --> 37:20.037
Which is why
we got a log from IT

37:20.137 --> 37:22.773
for every computer that
ran printing jobs last week.

37:22.873 --> 37:25.843
And according to the log,
you printed six image files

37:25.943 --> 37:28.212
the day before the photos
were put in Lindsay's mailbox.

37:28.312 --> 37:30.615
- Yeah, those were for the case.
- Oh.

37:30.715 --> 37:32.717
Well, we also found
a receipt from a toy store

37:32.817 --> 37:35.253
in your most recent
expense report.

37:35.353 --> 37:37.622
Maybe for the doll that went
through Lindsay's window?

37:37.722 --> 37:39.390
This is ridiculous!

37:39.490 --> 37:42.460
And you tried to frame
your boss by planting a USB key

37:42.560 --> 37:44.595
on a bench
near his climbing gym.

37:44.695 --> 37:46.364
I don't know what
you're talking about.

37:46.464 --> 37:47.565
Yeah,
it seems like that.

37:47.665 --> 37:49.700
But you know what?
I'd like to connect the dots

37:49.800 --> 37:51.535
for you, because... here.

37:51.636 --> 37:52.870
See these?

37:52.970 --> 37:56.374
These are caused
when something like dust

37:56.474 --> 38:00.878
sticks to the printer drum
and the toner builds up.

38:00.978 --> 38:05.116
It happens to my
home printer all the time.

38:05.216 --> 38:06.684
So?

38:06.784 --> 38:08.753
So, the error pages were
printed from the same printer

38:08.853 --> 38:10.021
as the surveillance shots.

38:10.121 --> 38:11.622
The splotches
are a perfect match.

38:11.722 --> 38:13.391
Look at that!

38:13.491 --> 38:14.792
I've got a great idea!

38:14.892 --> 38:16.294
Let's print something
from your printer.

38:16.394 --> 38:17.895
Kyle, you want
to do the honours?

38:17.995 --> 38:19.630
Of course.

38:19.730 --> 38:21.599
I...

38:21.699 --> 38:22.967
Sure.

38:25.336 --> 38:27.305
Hmm!

38:31.776 --> 38:33.844
Wow, look at that.

38:33.944 --> 38:35.913
An exact match.

38:37.815 --> 38:38.916
Crazy!

38:39.016 --> 38:42.987
Admit it, Ian.

38:43.087 --> 38:44.488
This is my case.

38:44.588 --> 38:45.756
It's my turn!

38:45.856 --> 38:49.694
But no,
I'm relegated to second chair.

38:49.794 --> 38:51.395
And "work husband"?

38:51.495 --> 38:53.597
Do you have any idea
how demeaning that is?

38:53.698 --> 38:55.666
You're asking a woman
if she knows how it feels

38:55.766 --> 38:57.034
to be demeaned at work?

38:57.134 --> 38:58.636
Hmph!

39:02.707 --> 39:04.342
I can't believe it.

39:04.442 --> 39:07.978
Sometimes it's hard to see the
guilt in people you work with.

39:08.079 --> 39:09.347
What is going on?

39:09.447 --> 39:10.948
- Was that Ian?
- Bruce!

39:11.048 --> 39:12.750
I'm so sorry,
something's come up.

39:12.850 --> 39:13.984
We need to delay.

39:14.085 --> 39:15.920
There's no delay!

39:16.020 --> 39:17.788
I'm back.

39:17.888 --> 39:19.924
I've had some time to reflect

39:20.024 --> 39:23.127
and I think I know the best way
forward for everyone.

39:23.227 --> 39:25.863
Right this way, Mr. Reddix.

39:25.963 --> 39:27.798
Nancy.
Kinsey.

39:27.898 --> 39:30.501
- Oh my God, hi!
- Hi!

39:39.176 --> 39:39.343
aramount.

39:42.580 --> 39:44.115
Mr. Moore
and the other plaintiffs

39:44.215 --> 39:46.817
will be generously compensated,
and their demand

39:46.917 --> 39:50.054
for greater occupational
health and safety will be met.

39:50.154 --> 39:53.157
Onyx Point will set up
additional workplace safeguards

39:53.257 --> 39:54.959
and partner with local hospitals

39:55.059 --> 39:58.329
to ensure regular employee
health and wellness checks.

39:58.429 --> 40:00.097
These changes will be immediate
across--

40:00.197 --> 40:01.298
Well!

40:01.399 --> 40:05.302
Another Spencer case solved!

40:05.403 --> 40:09.673
And Lindsay looks happy, so...
that's great.

40:09.774 --> 40:11.409
Wow, you look nice!

40:11.509 --> 40:13.844
Oh, thanks!
Date night.

40:13.944 --> 40:15.913
Your hair, hon...
It's not good.

40:16.013 --> 40:17.548
- No, no, no, don't--
- It's really not.

40:17.648 --> 40:18.983
- Oh, no!
- Look, come here.

40:19.083 --> 40:20.184
- Over here, over here.
- Oh...

40:20.284 --> 40:22.186
This one.
There we go.

40:22.286 --> 40:25.790
- There we go!
- Thanks.

40:25.890 --> 40:27.158
So you want to tell me
how you're really doing?

40:27.258 --> 40:28.726
I'm fine!

40:28.826 --> 40:31.162
You have a tell when
you're hiding your emotions.

40:31.262 --> 40:33.164
You say,
"I'm fine!"

40:33.264 --> 40:34.598
Good detective work.

40:34.698 --> 40:36.200
Yeah.

40:36.300 --> 40:40.237
You want me to be honest
about my feelings?

40:40.337 --> 40:43.140
I still have some for Lucas,

40:43.240 --> 40:45.676
but he's with Lindsay now
and they're getting married,

40:45.776 --> 40:49.980
so I have to be a grown-up.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.248
Happy?

40:51.348 --> 40:53.918
Only when you are.

40:56.687 --> 40:59.390
Don't worry, I am going out
for a drink with Billy.

40:59.490 --> 41:01.625
Okay, good.

41:05.162 --> 41:08.165
Thanks, Mom.

41:14.605 --> 41:16.040
I wasn't sure
what you'd like,

41:16.140 --> 41:17.875
so I got us a little
bit of everything.

41:17.975 --> 41:22.146
Har gow, siu mai,
some custard buns...

41:22.246 --> 41:24.982
I'd keep going, but I assume

41:25.082 --> 41:27.885
you're gonna interrupt me
right about... now.

41:27.985 --> 41:29.453
Now?

41:29.553 --> 41:31.188
Okay, I have to be
honest with you.

41:31.288 --> 41:33.624
- Okay.
- I may be a bit of a mess.

41:33.724 --> 41:35.626
Don't worry,
we've got plenty of napkins.

41:35.726 --> 41:37.528
Uh, no, I mean...

41:39.864 --> 41:42.032
You may be able to tell
based on how distracted

41:42.132 --> 41:44.368
I've seemed
for the past few days.

41:44.468 --> 41:47.805
I, um...

41:47.905 --> 41:49.607
I just don't think I'm...

41:49.707 --> 41:53.777
quite ready for a relationship.

41:53.878 --> 41:57.781
Okay, uh, who said anything
about a relationship?

41:57.882 --> 42:00.317
Oh!
I thought--

42:00.417 --> 42:02.319
No, no, no.
No, no, I-I love--

42:02.419 --> 42:04.822
Look, I love that you're
thinking about my feelings.

42:04.922 --> 42:06.156
But, you know, we're just

42:06.257 --> 42:08.092
starting to get to know
each other, so...

42:08.192 --> 42:11.295
you know, let's...
let's take the pressure off!

42:11.395 --> 42:12.496
Okay!

42:12.596 --> 42:15.466
Yeah, take things
one dumpling at a time.

42:15.566 --> 42:16.901
- Yeah?
- I can do that.

42:17.001 --> 42:18.502
- Okay.
- Thanks.

42:18.602 --> 42:19.703
- You're welcome.
- Um...

42:19.803 --> 42:23.307
But if you didn't bring
egg tarts, it's over.

42:23.407 --> 42:24.608
Oh.

42:24.708 --> 42:26.610
I brought egg tarts.

42:29.480 --> 42:32.249
- Pass me those.
- Yeah.
