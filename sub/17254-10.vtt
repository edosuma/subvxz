(Billy)
It's gotta to happen, T.

00:03.837 --> 00:05.706
You and Johnny got to double
date with me and Maeve.

00:05.739 --> 00:07.475
It'd just be so much fun.

00:07.508 --> 00:10.811
Johnny, Billy, and the
Kelly girls, out on the town.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.846
Got to happen.

00:12.880 --> 00:15.316
Honestly, Johnny just isn't
the double date kind of dude.

00:15.349 --> 00:17.518
You know what?
I'm gonna reach out to him.

00:17.551 --> 00:19.087
Make my case.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.355
- All right.
- I'm not gonna let up, T.

00:21.389 --> 00:22.556
[phone chimes]

00:22.590 --> 00:23.924
(Hank)
Oh, it's Billy.

00:23.957 --> 00:24.925
He wants to get
you guys to double date

00:24.958 --> 00:26.660
with him and Maeve.

00:26.694 --> 00:27.661
I'll tell him you're
free this Saturday?

00:27.695 --> 00:28.896
Yeah, right.

00:28.929 --> 00:30.698
Free to never go on
a double date.

00:30.731 --> 00:32.866
- Oh, I love double dating.
- I don't. I hate it.

00:32.900 --> 00:34.235
Sitting around some restaurant
I don't want to be at

00:34.268 --> 00:35.169
talking about other
people's shit?

00:35.203 --> 00:36.237
No.

00:36.270 --> 00:38.106
So I should just ignore it?

00:38.139 --> 00:39.573
Yeah, it's one of the perks
of being the driver.

00:39.607 --> 00:40.841
People don't expect you
to text back.

00:40.874 --> 00:42.776
Mm. Mm-hmm.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.512
- I would expect a text back.
- I would also.

00:44.545 --> 00:45.579
Hmm?

00:45.613 --> 00:46.714
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.688
Johnny hasn't hit me back,

00:54.722 --> 00:56.424
but he's driving, so I'm sure
he'll get at me.

00:56.457 --> 00:58.226
Oh, I'm sure.

00:58.259 --> 01:00.027
All right, I'm coming at you
from another direction.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.195
Something active.

01:01.229 --> 01:02.530
We could rent bikes.

01:02.563 --> 01:03.631
We could kayak
on the river.

01:03.664 --> 01:05.299
We could play tennis.

01:05.333 --> 01:07.201
Why is it so
important to you?

01:07.235 --> 01:10.204
Because I can't stand
to see the way

01:10.238 --> 01:11.739
that you and Maeve
don't get along.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.073
She's your sister.

01:13.107 --> 01:14.642
You should be hanging out
all the time.

01:14.675 --> 01:16.644
It's okay, Billy.

01:16.677 --> 01:19.280
This is me and Maeve's
problem, not yours.

01:19.313 --> 01:23.050
Then why does it
eat me alive?

01:23.083 --> 01:23.984
I don't know.

01:24.017 --> 01:25.653
I do, T.

01:25.686 --> 01:27.555
Because one day we
all gonna be 50 years old,

01:27.588 --> 01:29.257
and you and Maeve
are gonna hate each other

01:29.290 --> 01:31.492
and you and Johnny
are never gonna visit us.

01:31.525 --> 01:34.128
Then one day, our kids are gonna
pass each other on the street.

01:34.162 --> 01:35.263
You know what they're gonna do?

01:35.296 --> 01:36.630
- What?
- Nothing.

01:36.664 --> 01:38.266
They're just gonna
keep on walking

01:38.299 --> 01:40.000
because they won't know
each other, T.

01:40.033 --> 01:42.002
Okay, okay, okay!

01:42.035 --> 01:44.905
I'll talk to Johnny,
and, I, you know...

01:44.938 --> 01:46.240
I'll see if he wants
to play tennis.

01:46.274 --> 01:47.241
He likes tennis.

01:47.275 --> 01:48.942
Yeah, dog.
See?

01:48.976 --> 01:51.312
All right, I can get us into
the Lakeshore Tennis Club.

01:51.345 --> 01:52.980
What, don't you have to be
a member to get in there?

01:53.013 --> 01:54.448
Nah, my cousin Bebo
can hook it up.

01:54.482 --> 01:55.983
He's the head locker room
attendant there.

01:56.016 --> 01:57.117
He can get us a court

01:57.151 --> 01:58.486
whenever we want.
- Hmm!

01:58.519 --> 02:00.321
Ain't nobody there
gonna mess with Bebo.

02:00.354 --> 02:03.424
Towels is where
the power's at, T.

[hip-hop music]

02:06.527 --> 02:08.329
Honestly, I think you got off
pretty easy on this one, John.

02:08.362 --> 02:09.797
Yeah,
I can live with tennis

02:09.830 --> 02:11.299
as a one-time thing.

02:11.332 --> 02:12.766
It'll get Billy
off Theresa's back,

02:12.800 --> 02:15.369
and I get to whoop
some ass on the court.

02:15.403 --> 02:16.804
Oh, I love
cocky Johnny.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.138
Yeah, you do.

02:18.172 --> 02:20.774
[phone ringing]

02:20.808 --> 02:23.143
Hey, can you all give me
some privacy, please?

02:23.177 --> 02:24.111
- Nope.
- No.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.146
Fine.

02:26.180 --> 02:27.315
Hey, baby.

02:27.348 --> 02:29.717
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, baby.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.320
(Cash)
Yes, sugar,
I got him right here.

02:32.353 --> 02:35.389
Your mama wants a word.

02:35.423 --> 02:36.557
Hey, Mama.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.058
- Hey, Mama.
- Hey, Mama.

02:38.091 --> 02:39.960
Can you two grow up
and go wash the rig?

02:39.993 --> 02:41.495
What's going on?

02:41.529 --> 02:44.131
Did you see the game D. Rose
had last night?

02:44.164 --> 02:48.369
Oh, that boy,
he had a triple double.

02:48.402 --> 02:52.072
He's resurrecting himself
like my Lord and Savior.

02:52.105 --> 02:55.142
Did you know that D Rose and I,
we have the same birthday?

02:55.175 --> 02:57.245
If you know of anyone
thinking of getting

02:57.278 --> 03:00.848
D Rose something special,
they better start shopping soon.

03:00.881 --> 03:03.317
Mama, you already invited me
to dinner that night.

03:03.351 --> 03:05.986
I am not going to forget
your birthday.

03:06.019 --> 03:06.987
Not now.

03:07.020 --> 03:08.489
[laughs]

03:08.522 --> 03:10.824
I'll see you on
my very special day.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.060
Okay, Mama, I'm gonna
hand you back to Cash.

03:15.729 --> 03:17.164
Hey, baby.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.832
I love you too.

03:18.866 --> 03:19.933
Bye.

03:19.967 --> 03:24.338
Happy day before your birthday.

03:24.372 --> 03:26.039
You know I love your mom,
right?

03:26.073 --> 03:27.875
But I don't get why adults
make such a big deal

03:27.908 --> 03:29.209
about their birthday.

03:29.243 --> 03:30.611
- It's weird.
- I know.

03:30.644 --> 03:32.179
I mean, maybe the milestones,
but 57?

03:32.212 --> 03:33.781
Come on.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.583
I could not disagree
with this viewpoint more,

03:35.616 --> 03:37.351
so I'm going
to recuse myself.

03:37.385 --> 03:38.619
(Hank)
And it's like no matter
what I get her,

03:38.652 --> 03:40.388
it's always somehow
not good enough.

03:40.421 --> 03:42.022
I'm sure that's not true.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.791
Oh, no, she makes
her displeasure very clear.

03:43.824 --> 03:46.226
"Oh, it's a fine present,
Henry,

03:46.260 --> 03:49.930
especially considering
how busy you are."

03:49.963 --> 03:51.064
I mean, it's not like
I don't try.

03:51.098 --> 03:52.566
Last year I got her an iPad,

03:52.600 --> 03:54.302
downloaded all those
Terry McMillan romances

03:54.335 --> 03:55.736
she loves so much.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.371
She never even took it
out of the box.

03:57.405 --> 03:58.872
(Brian)
If she's not gonna
use that, Hank,

03:58.906 --> 04:00.774
I'm willing to offer
20 cents on the dollar.

04:00.808 --> 04:02.476
Just saying.

04:02.510 --> 04:05.245
Shit, man, I'll help you
find a gift for her.

04:05.279 --> 04:06.980
I'm a genius at
buying women presents.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.549
You know what, she loved
the shit out that

04:08.582 --> 04:09.883
Christmas present
you bought for her.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.051
Why don't you just
pick something up?

04:11.084 --> 04:12.886
I'll pay you back.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.221
Now you know what
I'm gonna say, don't you?

04:14.254 --> 04:15.756
- No.
- What am I always

04:15.789 --> 04:18.258
- talking about?
- Vietnam.

04:18.292 --> 04:20.093
- Besides that.
- Fish?

04:20.127 --> 04:22.396
Yes, what's the saying
about fishing?

04:22.430 --> 04:24.064
It's boring as hell?

04:24.097 --> 04:27.267
If you give a man a fish,
he eats for a day.

04:27.301 --> 04:30.671
If you teach a man to fish,
he eats forever.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.740
Does that make
any sense to you, son?

04:32.773 --> 04:34.274
I honestly don't remember
what you're talking about.

04:43.317 --> 04:44.918
- my bucket list, please?
- I don't know where it is.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.820
It's in the rig.

04:48.789 --> 04:51.692
Brian, that baby
is not a toy.

04:53.661 --> 04:54.795
Hi, she's in the
living room.

04:54.828 --> 04:56.697
Oh, okay.
Oh, here we are.

04:56.730 --> 04:58.265
Oh, thank God you guys
are here.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.833
Okay, I just have
to pack a few things.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.168
Okay, where's my
phone charger?

05:01.201 --> 05:03.170
Honey, you're doing
so great.

05:03.203 --> 05:05.373
I really think we should
stick to our birth plan.

05:05.406 --> 05:07.775
Your birth plan,
my vagina.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.543
Okay? Yeah.
Okay, can you guys go ahead

05:09.577 --> 05:10.711
and call the hospital
and tell them

05:10.744 --> 05:12.112
that I just
need an epidural?

05:12.145 --> 05:14.014
Well, we'll get you
to the hospital,

05:14.047 --> 05:15.282
and the doctors will hook you
up with whatever drugs you want.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.451
I want it all,
whatever they got, okay?

05:17.485 --> 05:18.986
My grandma says that they used
to just knock you out,

05:19.019 --> 05:20.654
and then you just wake up
with a baby.

05:20.688 --> 05:22.155
That's--I want--
I would like that, please.

05:22.189 --> 05:24.525
I am so sick of all this
hippie birth shit.

05:24.558 --> 05:26.326
Wow, Liz.
That really hurts.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.728
Does it, Heidi?

05:27.761 --> 05:28.729
Does it--does it--
does it hurt?

05:28.762 --> 05:30.230
Are you hurting right now?

05:30.263 --> 05:31.832
Okay, that was
a poor choice of words.

05:31.865 --> 05:34.234
I think what I mean is
that I am disappointed.

05:34.267 --> 05:36.069
Okay, are you the midwife?

05:36.103 --> 05:38.406
Yeah, she's having
irregular contractions,

05:38.439 --> 05:41.074
and she's been stuck
at 5 centimeters

05:41.108 --> 05:43.343
for the last three hours.

05:43.377 --> 05:44.378
All right. Ow.

05:44.412 --> 05:45.879
(Liz)
Oh, shit.

05:45.913 --> 05:48.248
Shit, shit, shit,
shitty, shit, shit.

05:48.281 --> 05:50.083
Dicks!
- Liz, if I could just remind--

05:50.117 --> 05:51.985
Shut your stupid
bitch mouth, Heidi.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.754
I swear to God I'm gonna
punch you in your face.

05:53.787 --> 05:55.523
Okay, I think we all need
to get our heads wrapped

05:55.556 --> 05:56.757
around the fact that Liz

05:56.790 --> 05:58.492
is going to the hospital.
- Yeah.

05:58.526 --> 06:01.395
Liz, wait, what if the doctors
make you have a c-section?

06:01.429 --> 06:04.331
If I had a knife right now, I'd
just cut it out myself, okay?

06:04.364 --> 06:06.366
- Wow, dark, dark.
- [whispers] Yeah. Yeah.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.568
[groans]

06:07.601 --> 06:09.236
Shitty, shit, shit Christ tits,

06:09.269 --> 06:12.072
shit Christ tits,
shit Christ tits.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.674
Well, at least she finally
chose a mantra, I guess.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.342
Here we go.

06:15.375 --> 06:16.243
Okay, put the pedal down, boys.
Here we go.

06:16.276 --> 06:18.278
Here we go.

06:18.311 --> 06:19.947
So we're gonna be taking her
to City if you want to come by.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.048
Sorry it didn't work out.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.716
Happens half the time, so...

06:22.750 --> 06:24.284
Yeah, no, we can actually
leave that.

06:24.317 --> 06:25.453
Yeah, you can leave that.

06:25.486 --> 06:26.920
Okay. Here we go.

06:26.954 --> 06:29.389
Take Damen.
It's got bike lanes.

06:29.423 --> 06:31.692
- Okay.
- Have a blessed.

06:31.725 --> 06:33.226
You have a blessed.

06:33.260 --> 06:35.563
Damn it.

06:35.596 --> 06:37.698
(Liz)
Shit Christ tits,
shit Christ tits,

06:37.731 --> 06:38.966
shit Christ tits!

06:38.999 --> 06:40.534
Whoo!

06:40.568 --> 06:42.035
Okay, we'll be
there soon.

06:42.069 --> 06:43.804
I can't believe
how much pain is involved

06:43.837 --> 06:45.573
in bringing a child
into the world.

06:45.606 --> 06:48.041
Your mom deserves a really good
birthday present, Hank.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.443
You got to get her
something good.

06:49.477 --> 06:50.778
You don't get your mom
good presents?

06:50.811 --> 06:52.279
I try.
She's never satisfied.

06:52.312 --> 06:54.414
Oh! Try harder!

06:54.448 --> 06:55.783
Cash said he's really good
at buying gifts.

06:55.816 --> 06:57.317
Why not take his help?

06:57.350 --> 06:58.986
I don't want to go
shopping with Cash.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.888
Then you and I can go.
We'll hit up Michaels.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.322
We'll make her something
from the heart.

07:02.355 --> 07:03.957
It doesn't cost an arm
and a leg, huh?

07:03.991 --> 07:05.459
What do you say?

07:05.493 --> 07:07.995
Hey, Cash,
you still want to help me

07:08.028 --> 07:09.563
buy my mom
a birthday present?

07:09.597 --> 07:11.999
Who wants to take
my shift tomorrow?

07:14.167 --> 07:16.303
You know I want it.

07:16.336 --> 07:17.838
Thanks, Cash.

07:17.871 --> 07:19.973
Pick me up at
10:00 tomorrow.

07:20.007 --> 07:21.475
- Yes, sir.
- 10:30.

07:21.509 --> 07:23.844
- Okay.
- Make it an even 11:00.

07:23.877 --> 07:25.178
11:00.

07:25.212 --> 07:26.346
Solid time to shop.

07:31.985 --> 07:32.953
(Theresa)
Hey, guys.

07:32.986 --> 07:34.955
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:34.988 --> 07:36.456
(Johnny)
Damn, Billy.

07:36.490 --> 07:38.191
You dress like you can play.
Can you?

07:38.225 --> 07:39.259
Guess we'll just have
to wait and see, bro.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.028
Can you?

07:41.061 --> 07:42.429
Guess we'll just have
to wait and see, bro.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.964
I like what's
happening here.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.198
Maeve, you've never played
tennis in your life.

07:45.232 --> 07:46.634
How do you have
an entire tennis outfit?

07:46.667 --> 07:48.435
How do you not?

07:48.468 --> 07:50.270
(Johnny)
Okay, you guys need
to know one thing.

07:50.303 --> 07:53.140
There's a strict
no cursing policy here.

07:53.173 --> 07:56.276
Yeah, this place is classy,
so don't be assholes.

07:56.309 --> 07:59.112
Okay, so when I play
with my cousin Bebo,

07:59.146 --> 08:00.380
we like to use
substitute words.

08:00.413 --> 08:02.482
If I need to say
the shit word,

08:02.516 --> 08:04.985
I say shish kebab 'cause
it's fun to say and it's tasty.

08:05.018 --> 08:06.286
Shish kebab.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.988
If I need to drop an F bomb,

08:08.021 --> 08:10.457
I say Fran Tarkenton

08:10.490 --> 08:12.793
because he was a crafty
quarterback who was too small,

08:12.826 --> 08:14.828
but he did not give a Fran...

08:14.862 --> 08:16.196
- Tarkenton.
- Tarkenton.

08:16.229 --> 08:17.397
- You feel me?
- I feel you.

08:17.430 --> 08:18.699
- Let's do this.
- Let's do this.

08:18.732 --> 08:20.634
- Okay.
- We're gonna

08:20.668 --> 08:22.536
- Fran Tarkenton them up.
- Shit.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.805
(Brian)
I can't believe you let me sit
two-chair, Stats.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.473
I mean, you're next
in line in succession.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.841
You don't have to sit
in the bucket.

08:27.875 --> 08:29.209
I call it center chair.

08:29.242 --> 08:31.511
I like it better this way.

08:31.545 --> 08:33.847
You get to be in the center
of everything.

08:33.881 --> 08:37.484
So do I have all
the two-chair privileges, or...

08:37.517 --> 08:40.087
We don't call it two-chair,
Brian, but enjoy.

08:42.723 --> 08:44.925
Dispatch, this is Brian Czyk.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.094
I'm gonna be sitting two-chair
in rig 1 today,

08:47.127 --> 08:50.197
so don't be alarmed if you hear
my voice instead of Cash's.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.065
Also, just a heads up--

08:52.099 --> 08:54.768
be trying out
some new call responses.

08:54.802 --> 08:57.070
For instance, instead
of saying something like,

08:57.104 --> 08:59.106
"Ambulance 1 responding,"

08:59.139 --> 09:01.041
I'm gonna throw
something at you like,

09:01.074 --> 09:03.543
"Ambo numero uno
responder."

09:03.577 --> 09:05.713
I don't know,
just go with it.

09:05.746 --> 09:07.848
(woman)
Please keep this line clear
for emergencies only.

09:07.881 --> 09:11.118
Comprende.
Lo siento, mi amor.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.886
Hey, where do you guys
want to eat today?

09:12.920 --> 09:15.956
Oh, it's Saturday,
so we have to have tacos.

09:15.989 --> 09:17.791
Why?

09:17.825 --> 09:20.961
Cash isn't here.
We can do whatever we want.

09:20.994 --> 09:25.532
Oh, we can finally try
that vegan diner.

09:25.565 --> 09:29.102
Oh, jeez, Johnny and Hank
would never go there.

09:29.136 --> 09:31.038
Freedom is in
the air, kids.

09:31.071 --> 09:32.405
I'm coming for you, quinoa.

09:33.674 --> 09:34.942
When you said 11:00,

09:34.975 --> 09:36.376
I thought you would have
already eaten.

09:36.409 --> 09:38.445
You can't shop
on a empty stomach.

09:38.478 --> 09:40.648
It leads to
hasty decisions.

09:40.681 --> 09:42.616
Besides, you got
somewhere to be?

09:42.650 --> 09:44.985
- Yeah, um...
- Wrong!

09:45.018 --> 09:46.654
When you're buying
a present for someone,

09:46.687 --> 09:48.588
you got to give it
the whole day.

09:48.622 --> 09:52.492
This day is as much for your
mama as her actual birthday.

09:52.525 --> 09:54.161
Wait, so now I got
this whole day,

09:54.194 --> 09:55.963
her actual birthday day,

09:55.996 --> 09:57.831
plus the day after
her birthday day

09:57.865 --> 09:59.800
to talk about how great
her birthday day was.

09:59.833 --> 10:02.770
Listen, man,
that's who your mama is.

10:02.803 --> 10:05.238
And that's the first rule
of buying gifts.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.407
You buy for the person
you're buying for.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.143
Don't buy for the person
you want them to be.

10:10.177 --> 10:11.979
Your mama don't want
no damn Kindle.

10:12.012 --> 10:13.246
It was an iPad.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.915
We're paperback people,
son.

10:14.948 --> 10:16.784
Rule number two,

10:16.817 --> 10:20.620
listen, watch, observe.

10:20.654 --> 10:25.158
Besides you, what is it that
your mom likes to talk about?

10:25.192 --> 10:27.594
Um...Jesus.

10:27.627 --> 10:29.697
Yes! And...

10:29.730 --> 10:32.599
also begins with a J.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.434
Sparkles...

10:34.467 --> 10:35.836
Jewelry.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.305
Bingo!
[laughs]

10:38.338 --> 10:42.075
Now where do you think that
those two things intersect?

10:45.645 --> 10:47.147
Here we come.

10:51.318 --> 10:52.385
[Theresa grunts]

10:54.521 --> 10:55.588
(Theresa)
Nice.

11:01.028 --> 11:02.495
Winner, snitch.

11:02.529 --> 11:04.197
Don't try to slice
my topspin, rook.

11:04.231 --> 11:05.999
Don't try and slice
his topspin.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.235
- It can't be done, baby.
- It can't be done.

11:08.268 --> 11:11.338
Shut up, Maeve--you're not
even hitting the ball.

11:11.371 --> 11:12.706
Why didn't you tell me
this guy was this good?

11:12.740 --> 11:14.041
Would it have made
a difference?

11:14.074 --> 11:15.575
Yeah, I would've
stretched more.

11:15.608 --> 11:17.244
What do you think
about this one?

11:17.277 --> 11:18.812
It's gaudy as hell.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.749
Okay, close your eyes.

11:21.782 --> 11:25.418
Close your eyes and picture
your mom wearing it.

11:27.387 --> 11:28.321
Oh, it's too small.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.157
Very good.

11:30.190 --> 11:33.526
Your mom does not like small
jewelry, small anything.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.228
All right, I think I got
the ticket here.

11:38.298 --> 11:41.234
Okay...let me see.

11:42.602 --> 11:43.837
Oh, it's perfect.

11:43.871 --> 11:46.239
No, no.
No, that's too much.

11:46.273 --> 11:48.375
Really?
Are you sure?

11:48.408 --> 11:50.878
There, that's the one.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.913
That's the one?

11:52.946 --> 11:55.682
Yeah, I guess it's nice.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.786
Open up your eyes, man.
I said this is the one.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.253
[stammers]

12:00.287 --> 12:01.889
You know what?
I'll take it.

12:01.922 --> 12:05.092
- Wrap it up nice, Melina.
- Do you want a bow?

12:05.125 --> 12:07.060
- Do I want a bow?
- You want a bow.

12:07.094 --> 12:09.096
Classy store-bought card,

12:09.129 --> 12:12.065
two simple sentences of love
written in black ink

12:12.099 --> 12:13.867
with proper penmanship.

12:13.901 --> 12:14.868
You're done.

12:14.902 --> 12:16.436
Thanks, Cash.

12:16.469 --> 12:18.238
You know, when you first
started dating my mom,

12:18.271 --> 12:20.573
I was a little
uncomfortable about it.

12:20.607 --> 12:24.077
But now, I'm still
uncomfortable about it,

12:24.111 --> 12:25.278
but she could've
done worse.

12:25.312 --> 12:26.313
She has.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.548
[laughter]

12:28.581 --> 12:31.118
- This is so much fun.
- Uh-huh.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.086
You got shuffle the deck
every once in a while, right?

12:33.120 --> 12:35.322
I wish I could get rig 14
to switch things up

12:35.355 --> 12:36.723
even for just one day.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.892
- That ain't happening.
- Okay...

12:38.926 --> 12:41.728
if you could only eat one food
for the rest of your life--

12:41.761 --> 12:43.730
Peanut butter.

12:43.763 --> 12:45.298
(Billy)
15, love.

12:53.807 --> 12:56.443
- Oh!
- Ooh, 30, love.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.645
Babe, you're never
letting me hit the ball.

12:58.678 --> 13:00.247
Oh, I'm sorry, baby.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.581
It's just that you're
not very good,

13:01.614 --> 13:03.116
and it's fun to win.
- [sighs]

13:03.150 --> 13:04.284
- Come on, baby.
- I don't want to hear it.

13:04.317 --> 13:05.652
It's fine.
Just step it up.

13:05.685 --> 13:07.654
- Keep your feet moving.
- 30, love.

13:11.658 --> 13:13.660
[blows rapid breaths]

13:15.162 --> 13:16.329
Come on, man,
let's go.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.034
Whoa, shit, cock, balls!

13:21.068 --> 13:23.470
Hey!

13:23.503 --> 13:25.772
Sorry, Tim.

13:25.805 --> 13:26.806
That's a warning.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.109
Sorry.

13:29.142 --> 13:31.311
God, Theresa,
show a little class.

13:31.344 --> 13:32.880
- Set point.
- My return to serve.

13:32.913 --> 13:34.514
Stay at the net.
I'll cover the baseline.

13:34.547 --> 13:36.316
Yeah, I know how
to play the game, John.

13:36.349 --> 13:39.152
Okay, let's play.

13:39.186 --> 13:41.721
- Come on, man.
- I'm in your head, baby.

13:41.754 --> 13:43.223
I'm in your kitchen.
I'm cooking you breakfast.

13:43.256 --> 13:44.157
Yeah, I know you're
in my kitchen.

13:44.191 --> 13:45.692
Let's go.

13:45.725 --> 13:47.127
I'm making you flapjacks,
Johnathan.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.361
Hope you're hungry.

13:48.395 --> 13:49.863
These flapjacks
are coming in hot.

13:49.897 --> 13:51.731
No, babe, baby, don't say that.

13:51.764 --> 13:53.233
I'm the one cooking
the breakfast.

13:53.266 --> 13:54.567
- I'm the one who says it.
- Whatever.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.073
Stop bouncing the ball
and serve.

14:03.676 --> 14:05.578
Whoo!
Ace, snitch.

14:05.612 --> 14:06.646
We win!

14:06.679 --> 14:07.881
(Theresa)
Nice.

14:07.915 --> 14:09.883
Maeve is driving me
crazy.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.251
She's over here talking
all this smack,

14:11.284 --> 14:12.352
and I'm the one
doing everything.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.254
Yeah, I hate it when she wins.

14:14.287 --> 14:16.223
What do you guys think about
switching up the teams a little?

14:16.256 --> 14:17.224
- Yup, sounds good to me.
- Let's switch 'em up, man.

14:17.257 --> 14:18.591
See what happens.

14:18.625 --> 14:19.526
Probably the same thing,
but who knows.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.328
I doubt that.

14:21.361 --> 14:23.964
The only thing Theresa's
ever beat me at is losing.

14:32.439 --> 14:35.775
- Fran Tarkenton!
- Oh ho ho ho!

14:35.808 --> 14:38.611
That's the thing your boyfriend
and I do when we win a point.

14:38.645 --> 14:41.514
Okay, T, that ball was
in my smash zone.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.516
You got to let me
smash those.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.452
Also, FYI,
match point, losers.

14:45.485 --> 14:47.120
T, baby,
go to the net, okay?

14:47.154 --> 14:49.022
Just stay out of
the smash zone, all right?

14:49.056 --> 14:52.625
This whole area--this whole
area is my smash zone.

14:54.827 --> 14:55.963
Come on.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.701
- Got it.
- Got it.

15:01.734 --> 15:03.103
- Ha ha!
- Oh!

15:03.136 --> 15:04.604
Cauliflower!

15:04.637 --> 15:06.073
What is that even
a substitute for?

15:06.106 --> 15:08.775
I am not answering
questions right now, T.

15:08.808 --> 15:09.876
[laughing]

15:09.909 --> 15:10.944
- Uhh!
- Uh!

15:10.978 --> 15:13.246
- Uh! Uh!
- Uh! Mm-mm-mm!

15:13.280 --> 15:15.082
[both grunting, humming]

15:15.115 --> 15:17.450
- * What?
- Uh! Uh!

15:19.252 --> 15:21.888
I think that the winners
deserve some imported beers.

15:21.921 --> 15:24.157
And losers should get
something domestic.

15:24.191 --> 15:27.094
- Yes!
- Something from Milwaukee.

15:27.127 --> 15:28.962
Or maybe nothing
at all.

15:28.996 --> 15:30.830
- And we get martinis.
- Oh.

15:30.863 --> 15:33.600
- We want a rematch.
- Yes.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.135
- Team MJ accepts.
- Mm-hmm.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.070
M is for Maeve.
J is for Johnny.

15:37.104 --> 15:39.172
And also for
Michael Jordan 'cause...

15:39.206 --> 15:41.741
- we're the greatest.
- We're the greatest.

15:41.774 --> 15:43.310
And we'll get
the first round,

15:43.343 --> 15:44.844
because we're
magnanimous winners.

15:44.877 --> 15:47.480
Yes, yes, let's get
you guys something to drink.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.616
Hey, I'll get
this one, partner.

15:49.649 --> 15:51.751
Hey, thanks, partner.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.086
Aww!

15:53.120 --> 15:55.622
I'm gonna kill her.

15:55.655 --> 15:58.992
Oh, easy, easy, that's my
teammate you're talking about.

15:59.026 --> 16:01.261
[laughs]

16:01.294 --> 16:02.295
What is it?

16:02.329 --> 16:04.264
Oh, just a text from Maeve.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.099
No, it didn't say anything.
You wouldn't get it.

16:06.133 --> 16:07.167
Oh.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.303
[Maeve and Johnny laughing]

16:10.337 --> 16:12.472
Johnny: Right?
Am I right?

16:12.505 --> 16:13.873
We have to beat them.

16:13.906 --> 16:15.508
I would like that
very much,

16:15.542 --> 16:16.976
but I'm gonna
level with you, T.

16:17.010 --> 16:19.379
If we want to win,
you need to get better.

16:19.412 --> 16:20.847
I didn't know you were
so competitive.

16:20.880 --> 16:22.015
I'm not competitive,
I just hate to lose.

16:22.049 --> 16:23.650
So do I.

16:23.683 --> 16:24.884
So you're gonna let me
teach you then, right?

16:24.917 --> 16:26.386
It could get awkward

16:26.419 --> 16:28.055
because you're the
senior partner at work.

16:28.088 --> 16:30.623
On the court, though,
between those lines,

16:30.657 --> 16:32.125
I got to lead.

16:32.159 --> 16:34.127
Are you willing
to listen to me, T?

16:34.161 --> 16:37.964
[Maeve and Johnny laughing]

16:37.997 --> 16:39.799
- Whatever it takes.
- Good.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.368
I'm gonna mold you like
wet, sloppy clay

16:41.401 --> 16:42.835
on one of those
spinning wheels.

16:42.869 --> 16:44.037
Mold me, baby.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.909
All right, now if I
get pulled up to the net,

16:49.942 --> 16:51.978
you got to fall back
and cover the baseline.

16:52.011 --> 16:52.879
- Okay.
- And don't forget to cover

16:52.912 --> 16:54.381
the alleys, T.
- Right.

16:54.414 --> 16:55.648
- You got that?
- Yeah, I got this.

16:55.682 --> 16:56.849
Yo, how's her lob?

16:56.883 --> 16:58.351
It's not in her
arsenal, bro.

16:58.385 --> 17:00.220
- Hey, I'm working on it.
- Yes, you are.

17:00.253 --> 17:02.089
- I'm getting there.
- Hey, there's no shame in it.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.923
No shame in it.
No one's got a perfect game.

17:03.956 --> 17:06.193
Even Federer, and he's
the greatest of all time.

17:06.226 --> 17:08.695
Nah, bro, you can't be
the greatest of all time

17:08.728 --> 17:10.430
when there's one dude
you can never beat.

17:10.463 --> 17:13.533
My boy Nadal owns that man.

17:13.566 --> 17:15.735
Don't forget the drop shot,
all right, Mama?

17:15.768 --> 17:17.104
Man, when you'd
shave your mustache?

17:17.137 --> 17:18.538
You look like a giant baby.

17:18.571 --> 17:19.939
[laughter]

17:24.043 --> 17:25.512
Out!

17:25.545 --> 17:27.714
What, you're seriously
calling that out?

17:27.747 --> 17:30.083
Clearly the honor system
is pointless around here.

17:30.117 --> 17:31.551
Nah, bro, we got the point.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.620
Serving for the match, losers.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.788
Winning is a terrible color
on you, Theresa,

17:35.822 --> 17:38.725
which is no surprise, because
every color is terrible on you.

17:38.758 --> 17:42.195
Oh, you rubbed it in our faces
last night, you "MJ" assholes.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.063
We are one point away
from beating you

17:44.097 --> 17:45.398
cock ass punk bitches.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.234
[whistle blows]

17:47.267 --> 17:49.302
(man)
That's it.
You're banned for life.

17:49.336 --> 17:50.903
That's a forfeit!
- Ooh!

17:50.937 --> 17:52.605
Still undefeated.

17:52.639 --> 17:53.906
- What?
- Oh, what?

17:53.940 --> 17:56.243
MJ all day.

17:56.276 --> 17:59.146
[both imitate hip-hop beat]

17:59.179 --> 18:00.813
*

18:00.847 --> 18:04.284
[scatting]

18:04.317 --> 18:07.554
- Ma.
- Oh, I love the bow.

18:07.587 --> 18:08.488
[chuckles]
Okay.

18:08.521 --> 18:12.058
Okay...

18:12.091 --> 18:13.126
[sighs]
Oh...

18:13.160 --> 18:15.828
Henry Isaiah St. Clare,

18:15.862 --> 18:20.333
this is the most thoughtful,
beautiful gift I've ever gotten.

18:20.367 --> 18:21.734
I love it.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.503
Thank you, Mama.
I had a little help.

18:23.536 --> 18:26.506
Oh, and look,
you've inscribed on the back

18:26.539 --> 18:28.241
my favorite Bible verse.

18:28.275 --> 18:29.609
John 8:12.

18:29.642 --> 18:31.511
[laughs]

18:31.544 --> 18:33.413
Oh...

18:33.446 --> 18:36.949
You are the sweetest,
most wonderful boy in the world.

18:36.983 --> 18:38.285
Oh, Mama.

18:38.318 --> 18:40.353
Thank you, Mama.

18:40.387 --> 18:41.521
Oh...

18:41.554 --> 18:44.257
Now, Cassius, I have no idea

18:44.291 --> 18:47.360
how you're gonna outdo that
Christmas gift you got me.

18:47.394 --> 18:49.028
Oh, Mama,
he gonna be great.

18:49.061 --> 18:51.130
Cash is the best gift giver
I've ever met.

18:51.164 --> 18:54.167
Why don't we keep this
about you, son?

18:54.201 --> 18:57.103
Loretta, we can open my gift
later when we're alone.

18:57.136 --> 18:58.671
Oh, don't be silly.

18:58.705 --> 19:00.307
Where is it?
Come on, where?

19:00.340 --> 19:02.442
Oh, I got it.

19:02.475 --> 19:06.179
Oh, love the bow.

19:06.213 --> 19:10.350
Oh, Cassius,
it's exactly right.

19:10.383 --> 19:13.720
Oh, Cassius,
it's perfect.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.322
Ah, ha, ha.

19:15.355 --> 19:17.324
Oh, and on the back,

19:17.357 --> 19:20.327
he also has inscribed
my favorite Bible verse,

19:20.360 --> 19:21.828
John 8:12.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.062
Oh, did he?

19:23.095 --> 19:26.799
"I am the light
of the world."

19:26.833 --> 19:28.868
You are to me, baby.

19:28.901 --> 19:30.703
You are to me.

19:30.737 --> 19:32.805
You know, I am going to go

19:32.839 --> 19:34.574
and put this beautiful necklace
on right now.

19:34.607 --> 19:36.042
Oh, you outdid yourself,
Padre.

19:36.075 --> 19:37.577
Come here.

19:40.112 --> 19:41.748
[laughter]

19:41.781 --> 19:43.950
You sure did, Padre.

19:47.254 --> 19:48.355
How could you?

19:48.388 --> 19:49.889
I panicked.

19:49.922 --> 19:51.057
You know how it is.

19:51.090 --> 19:52.725
She has to love you.

19:52.759 --> 19:55.094
I get my contract renewed
every day.

19:55.127 --> 19:56.663
That's some cold business.

19:56.696 --> 19:57.930
I'd do it again.

19:57.964 --> 19:59.399
Judas.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.369
I had no idea how much I cursed.

20:02.402 --> 20:03.870
- What, you?
- Yes!

20:03.903 --> 20:05.171
You have the mouth
of three sailors.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.773
Oh, shit.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.708
- Yeah, that's right.
- It's okay.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.243
It's one of the few things
I actually like about you.

20:10.277 --> 20:12.512
- Oh, thank you, bitch.
- You're welcome, skank.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.682
Aww, yeah, this is what
I'm talking about--family.

20:15.715 --> 20:18.251
Johnny, Billy, and the
Kelly girls out on the town.

20:18.285 --> 20:20.052
One of the Kelly girls
is undefeated.

20:20.086 --> 20:21.354
Yeah, on a technicality.

20:21.388 --> 20:22.522
Hey, a win's a win.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.056
But I gotta give it to you,
Billy.

20:24.090 --> 20:25.792
- Man, you can really play.
- Thanks, bro.

20:25.825 --> 20:27.760
I wish you would have
seen me in my prime.

20:27.794 --> 20:30.430
I was pretty dope before
I tore my rotator cuff

20:30.463 --> 20:31.731
and had to start
playing righty.

20:31.764 --> 20:33.266
- You were a lefty?
- I was.

20:33.300 --> 20:34.701
See, T, this is why
we got to hang out.

20:34.734 --> 20:36.303
We learn stuff
about each other.

20:36.336 --> 20:37.737
Well, you're all gonna
learn something about me.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.071
I am hungry as shit.

20:39.105 --> 20:40.540
- Who wants to get a bite?
- I do.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.275
I know this dope spot
where they combine

20:42.309 --> 20:45.478
my two favorite things--
food and swords.

20:45.512 --> 20:47.213
I'm in.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.581
(Billy)
Okay.

20:48.615 --> 20:49.649
Okay.

20:49.682 --> 20:50.917
[laughs]

21:08.768 --> 21:10.570
[sirens wail]

21:10.603 --> 21:11.804
[sirens stop]

21:22.882 --> 21:24.417
It was fun for
a minute though, right?

21:24.451 --> 21:25.752
No.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.887
I'm too big for
that damn seat.
