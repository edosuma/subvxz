00:17.184 --> 00:19.436
[clamoring voices]

00:29.488 --> 00:32.366
[overlapping shouts]

00:32.449 --> 00:34.076
- [man] Witches!
- [man â™ª2] Witchcraft!

00:34.159 --> 00:35.159
[sharp cry]

00:45.462 --> 00:49.174
[door bolt clanking]

00:49.258 --> 00:52.302
[creaky door opens]

01:00.018 --> 01:01.018
Who's that?

01:01.895 --> 01:02.938
Are the Speakers dead?

01:05.482 --> 01:07.359
[bestial voice]
No.

01:08.360 --> 01:09.778
Well, get back out there.

01:09.861 --> 01:12.656
The Speakers have to die
before the sun goes down.

01:12.739 --> 01:13.739
The sun...

01:14.658 --> 01:16.868
is already down.

01:19.538 --> 01:21.790
[low growl]

01:22.624 --> 01:24.251
[growling]

01:30.424 --> 01:33.385
You cannot enter the house of God.

01:33.468 --> 01:34.303
[snarl]

01:34.386 --> 01:37.889
God is not here.

01:37.973 --> 01:41.226
This is an empty box.

01:41.310 --> 01:43.520
[low snarls]

01:44.521 --> 01:48.191
God is in all His churches.

01:48.275 --> 01:51.486
Your God's love is not unconditional.

01:51.570 --> 01:54.364
He does not love us.

01:54.448 --> 01:57.951
And He does not love you.

01:58.035 --> 01:59.870
I have done His bidding.

01:59.953 --> 02:03.457
My life's work is in His name.

02:03.540 --> 02:07.794
Your life's work makes Him puke.

02:07.878 --> 02:11.381
I am the Bishop of Gresit!

02:11.465 --> 02:15.469
Your God knows that
we wouldn't be here without you.

02:15.552 --> 02:18.347
This is all your fault, isn't it?

02:18.430 --> 02:20.349
She was a witch!

02:20.432 --> 02:23.852
Lies? In your house of God?

02:23.935 --> 02:27.272
No wonder He has abandoned you.

02:27.356 --> 02:29.650
But we love you.

02:29.733 --> 02:31.276
[Bishop]
What?!

02:31.360 --> 02:33.570
[creature]
We love you.

02:34.905 --> 02:38.325
We couldn't be here without you.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.827
[terrified gasps]

02:40.911 --> 02:42.287
[rumbling snarl]

02:42.371 --> 02:43.372
Let me...

02:44.623 --> 02:46.375
kiss you.

02:46.458 --> 02:47.709
[chomping and slurping]

02:47.793 --> 02:49.294
[Bishop groans]

02:53.173 --> 02:54.800
[slurping continues]

02:54.883 --> 02:56.093
[Bishop groans]

02:59.179 --> 03:02.182
[slurping continues]

03:03.809 --> 03:05.811
[flesh tearing]

03:09.815 --> 03:12.651
[wings flapping]

03:22.119 --> 03:23.328
[running footsteps]

03:23.412 --> 03:26.456
[panting]

03:32.462 --> 03:33.880
[clamoring voices]

03:34.965 --> 03:36.383
He went that way!

03:37.467 --> 03:40.095
[panting]

03:41.138 --> 03:44.182
[clamor continues]

03:44.266 --> 03:45.267
[man]
Get him!

03:46.393 --> 03:49.271
[clamor continues]

03:50.439 --> 03:51.440
[exhales]

03:53.775 --> 03:55.444
[man]
We'll get him right now!

03:55.527 --> 03:57.529
[indistinct angry cries]

04:00.198 --> 04:02.534
[villagers gasp]

04:02.617 --> 04:04.536
- [panicked cries]
- [man] A sorcerer!

04:11.918 --> 04:13.670
Witch!

04:13.754 --> 04:15.756
No! I am a Speaker

04:15.839 --> 04:17.591
and a scholar of magic.

04:17.674 --> 04:19.885
I serve no demon and I do no evil.

04:22.721 --> 04:24.556
[frightened cries]

04:25.599 --> 04:26.808
[spirited grunt]

04:26.892 --> 04:28.310
[cries]

04:34.107 --> 04:36.443
[Trevor] You never told me
you were a magician.

04:36.526 --> 04:37.986
[Sypha]
You never asked.

04:38.069 --> 04:40.906
Though I guess
I now understand why it was you

04:40.989 --> 04:43.470
who went down into the catacombs
to look for your sleeping god.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.494
What are you doing here?

04:45.577 --> 04:47.621
I didn't ask you to fight for me.

04:47.704 --> 04:49.206
I fight for myself.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.499
Fine.

04:52.626 --> 04:53.626
You.

04:54.961 --> 04:57.130
Kill them! Quickly!

04:57.214 --> 04:58.423
No.

04:58.507 --> 05:00.592
Just you and me.

05:00.675 --> 05:01.927
Come on.

05:02.010 --> 05:05.263
You're very big at telling
other people what to do.

05:05.347 --> 05:08.850
Getting the good people of Gresit
to commit murder for you.

05:08.934 --> 05:11.019
Let's see how you do on your own.

05:11.102 --> 05:12.187
You and me.

05:13.355 --> 05:15.649
I can see you're carrying a blade.

05:15.732 --> 05:18.318
I wonder if the people of
the great city of Gresit

05:18.401 --> 05:21.363
have ever seen a priest
draw a knife before.

05:21.446 --> 05:24.115
- [man] Oh, what insolence!
- [man â™ª2] The priest has a knife.

05:24.199 --> 05:27.869
Your long knife, my short sword.

05:27.953 --> 05:29.287
Let's go.

05:31.373 --> 05:33.083
Come on.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.795
You had no problem
beating an old man this morning.

05:39.589 --> 05:40.674
Huh?

05:40.757 --> 05:45.428
You had no problem lying
to these people about the Speakers.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.722
The Speakers brought this upon us!

05:47.806 --> 05:50.934
No, they didn't, and you know it.

05:51.017 --> 05:54.354
The Speakers stayed here to offer aid.

05:54.437 --> 05:58.400
It was your bishop who brought
all this down on us.

05:58.483 --> 06:01.486
Your bishop who started it all

06:01.570 --> 06:03.405
by killing a defenseless woman.

06:03.488 --> 06:05.740
You would have made murderers
out of these people,

06:05.824 --> 06:09.369
but the only one here
who isn't innocent...

06:10.495 --> 06:11.496
is you.

06:11.580 --> 06:13.915
[running footsteps and panting]

06:13.999 --> 06:15.417
[priest groans]

06:15.500 --> 06:17.043
[cries out]

06:18.044 --> 06:20.171
[groans]

06:23.216 --> 06:24.843
[groans and clamoring voices]

06:26.386 --> 06:28.930
[villagers screaming]

06:29.014 --> 06:30.432
It's them. They're coming.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.477
[low, rumbling growl]

06:34.561 --> 06:36.563
[villagers screaming]

06:39.566 --> 06:42.652
Back to the far side of the square!

06:44.529 --> 06:47.198
Pikes! Up front, now!

06:47.282 --> 06:48.283
What?

06:48.366 --> 06:49.576
Why?

06:49.659 --> 06:52.787
Because I'm the only man here
who knows how to fight these things.

06:52.871 --> 06:55.749
Everyone with a pike or long weapon,

06:55.832 --> 06:57.667
get out in front with me.

06:57.751 --> 07:00.170
Six in front, six behind,

07:00.253 --> 07:02.088
and in between, pikes forward.

07:02.172 --> 07:03.590
Hold steady.

07:03.673 --> 07:04.883
I need a priest,

07:04.966 --> 07:07.385
one who was properly ordained
in a church.

07:10.972 --> 07:11.973
Grab some people.

07:12.057 --> 07:14.893
Go to the nearest well,
start drawing water.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.770
You know what to do with water, yes?

07:16.853 --> 07:18.271
For the aspersion?

07:18.355 --> 07:19.189
Go.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.774
- Sypha?
- Yes.

07:20.857 --> 07:23.568
I want them walled in
when they hit the square.

07:23.652 --> 07:26.321
I want it so they can
only come towards us.

07:26.404 --> 07:27.822
Is that something you can do?

07:27.906 --> 07:29.115
Will ice do?

07:29.199 --> 07:30.533
Better than fire, anyway.

07:30.617 --> 07:31.910
Let's hope so.

07:31.993 --> 07:35.538
I want salt over here!
As much as you can find!

07:38.792 --> 07:43.088
Everyone with a sword
wipes their blades in the salt.

07:43.171 --> 07:44.172
Now!

07:56.601 --> 07:57.811
[bestial growls]

08:00.105 --> 08:01.523
Sypha, walls.

08:10.532 --> 08:13.034
[flesh sizzles, creature shrieks]

08:15.662 --> 08:17.914
[low groans]

08:17.998 --> 08:22.419
Well. That priest really could make
holy water after all.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.712
Pikemen!

08:23.795 --> 08:25.547
Four steps forward!

08:26.923 --> 08:29.342
Sypha, close the door behind them.

08:31.886 --> 08:33.555
[rumbling snarl]

08:33.638 --> 08:35.473
[Trevor]
Rear pikes up!

08:35.557 --> 08:36.391
[shriek]

08:36.474 --> 08:37.642
Cut him down!

08:37.726 --> 08:40.020
[shrieks and groans]

08:40.103 --> 08:42.439
Salt kills demons!

08:42.522 --> 08:44.983
Don't forget... spread the word.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.156
[low shrieks]

08:52.490 --> 08:53.491
[men cry out]

08:53.575 --> 08:54.575
[Trevor]
Shit.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.287
[dying shriek]

08:58.371 --> 08:59.873
The whip's consecrated...

08:59.956 --> 09:02.459
for fighting vampires and demons.

09:02.542 --> 09:03.668
Swords!

09:05.587 --> 09:06.588
[sizzling]

09:06.671 --> 09:08.006
[creatures groan]

09:12.969 --> 09:14.137
[grunt]

09:15.388 --> 09:17.223
[Sypha grunts]

09:17.307 --> 09:19.809
[whip cracks, creature groans]

09:23.188 --> 09:24.188
[spirited grunt]

09:26.107 --> 09:27.609
[creature groans]

09:27.692 --> 09:29.694
[creature]
There's an army of us!

09:29.778 --> 09:31.321
An army...

09:31.404 --> 09:33.364
from hell!

09:45.418 --> 09:48.588
[bricks rumble and crash]

09:50.840 --> 09:52.425
[gasping]

09:52.509 --> 09:54.803
[both screaming]

10:01.226 --> 10:02.685
[Sypha grunts]

10:07.398 --> 10:09.025
[planks clatter]

10:09.109 --> 10:10.944
[distant machinery clanking]

10:13.029 --> 10:14.989
[Sypha groans softly]

10:18.660 --> 10:20.662
[Sypha]
The... catacombs again.

10:21.704 --> 10:24.666
I think we're deeper than I went before.

10:33.174 --> 10:34.676
[gasps]

10:34.759 --> 10:35.885
[gasps]

10:36.845 --> 10:37.846
[grunting]

10:39.597 --> 10:41.015
[Sypha cries out]

10:41.099 --> 10:42.600
Aah!

10:42.684 --> 10:44.769
[Sypha grunting]

10:44.853 --> 10:47.105
[both grunting]

10:47.188 --> 10:48.982
[Sypha panting]

10:59.159 --> 11:00.159
[gasps]

11:02.537 --> 11:04.706
[grunting]

11:06.916 --> 11:08.126
[Trevor grunts]

11:10.170 --> 11:13.089
[machinery clanking]

11:28.396 --> 11:29.814
[groans]

11:36.070 --> 11:37.070
[grunts]

11:41.242 --> 11:42.744
[grunts]

11:45.163 --> 11:46.289
[impact grunt]

11:47.373 --> 11:49.083
[gasps]

11:49.167 --> 11:50.167
Ohh.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.172
Oh, for God's sake.

11:57.508 --> 11:59.594
[grunting]

12:08.519 --> 12:09.938
[Sypha groans]

12:12.357 --> 12:13.441
[gasps]

12:13.524 --> 12:14.524
Ohh!

12:17.028 --> 12:20.490
[both screaming]

12:20.573 --> 12:21.574
[thud]

12:25.370 --> 12:29.082
[both groan]

12:51.938 --> 12:53.982
[machinery clanks and whirrs]

12:54.065 --> 12:55.066
I didn't do that.

12:55.149 --> 12:56.651
[gas hisses]

13:21.217 --> 13:22.844
Why are you here?

13:22.927 --> 13:24.178
The story...

13:24.262 --> 13:26.222
The Messiah sleeps under Gresit!

13:26.305 --> 13:28.391
The man who will save us from Dracula.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.643
And you?

13:31.644 --> 13:33.813
Are you in search of a mythical savior?

13:33.896 --> 13:36.149
I fell down a hole.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.151
Dracula is abroad in the land.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.652
He has an army of monsters.

13:39.736 --> 13:42.780
He's determined to wipe out
all human life wherever he finds it.

13:42.864 --> 13:45.700
Is that what you believe?

13:45.783 --> 13:48.369
[Trevor] That Dracula's released
his horde in Wallachia?

13:48.453 --> 13:49.662
That's fact.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.956
There's no "belief" involved.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.666
But that's not what you're asking.

13:53.750 --> 13:54.876
[man]
No.

13:54.959 --> 13:59.380
You're asking if I believe you're
some sleeping messiah who'll save us,

13:59.464 --> 14:01.466
and no, I don't.

14:01.549 --> 14:02.800
[Sypha] Belmont!

14:02.884 --> 14:04.218
[Trevor]
I know what you are.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.263
And what am I?

14:08.097 --> 14:09.724
You're a vampire.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.393
[gasps]

14:14.479 --> 14:16.898
So, I have to ask myself,

14:16.981 --> 14:20.443
have we come down here
to wake up the man who'll kill Dracula,

14:20.526 --> 14:23.905
or did we come here to wake Dracula?

14:23.988 --> 14:25.907
You call me Dracula.

14:25.990 --> 14:29.285
[Trevor] I'll call you anything you like
if you're gonna show me your teeth.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.537
[man]
She called you Belmont.

14:31.621 --> 14:32.622
House of Belmont?

14:32.705 --> 14:35.208
Trevor Belmont.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.460
Last son of the house of Belmont.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.921
The Belmonts fought creatures
of the night, did they not?

14:40.004 --> 14:41.005
For generations.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.509
Say what you mean.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.970
The Belmonts killed vampires.

14:48.054 --> 14:52.225
Until the good people decided
they didn't want us around.

14:52.308 --> 14:55.561
And now Dracula is carrying out
an execution order on the human race.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.564
Do you care, Belmont?

15:00.691 --> 15:04.654
Honestly, I didn't, no.

15:04.737 --> 15:05.905
But now...

15:06.906 --> 15:10.368
yes, it's time to stop it.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.372
Do you think you can?

15:14.455 --> 15:17.959
What I think...
is I'm going to have to kill you.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.460
Belmont, no!

15:19.544 --> 15:21.087
He's the one we've been waiting for.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.588
No, he's not.

15:22.672 --> 15:23.881
He's a vampire.

15:23.965 --> 15:27.135
And he's not been waiting here
for hundreds of years, have you?

15:27.218 --> 15:29.429
I don't like your tone, Belmont.

15:29.512 --> 15:32.432
This place is old,
but it's not been abandoned.

15:32.515 --> 15:33.933
It's alive and working.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.977
So, go on, vampire,

15:36.060 --> 15:39.939
tell her exactly how long
you've been waiting down here.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.900
What is the year of your Lord?

15:42.984 --> 15:44.277
[Sypha]
1476.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.487
[man]
Perhaps a year, then.

15:46.571 --> 15:47.405
There.

15:47.488 --> 15:48.573
And on top of that,

15:48.656 --> 15:51.868
what kind of messiah creates
mechanical death traps

15:51.951 --> 15:54.787
to buy himself an uninterrupted nap

15:54.871 --> 15:56.664
in a stone coffin?

15:56.747 --> 15:58.458
My defenses were not for you.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.543
You could have told your defenses that.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.253
They are machines, nothing more.

16:02.336 --> 16:04.505
They were not intended
to protect me from you.

16:04.589 --> 16:06.716
I asked you a question...
Do you care?

16:07.800 --> 16:10.720
I care about doing my family's work.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.972
I care about saving human lives.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.558
Am I going to have to kill you?

16:15.641 --> 16:17.059
Do you think you can?

16:17.143 --> 16:20.247
If you're really a Belmont and not some
runt running around with a family crest,

16:20.271 --> 16:21.439
you might be able to.

16:26.402 --> 16:27.862
Let's find out.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.697
Belmont, you can't do this!

16:29.780 --> 16:32.450
Tell it to your floating
vampire Jesus here.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.494
You've got nothing but insults,
have you?

16:34.577 --> 16:35.578
A tired little...

16:35.661 --> 16:37.163
[whip cracks]

16:37.246 --> 16:38.247
[grunts]

16:38.331 --> 16:39.332
[low growl]

16:41.250 --> 16:42.543
[panting]

16:42.627 --> 16:45.254
[vampiric hiss]

16:45.338 --> 16:46.339
[grunts]

16:47.423 --> 16:49.175
Stone the fuck up.

16:49.258 --> 16:50.551
[whip whooshes]

16:50.635 --> 16:52.220
[blade rings]

16:52.303 --> 16:54.222
You can't do this, Belmont!

16:54.305 --> 16:56.015
[Trevor]
He's not your messiah.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.726
Dracula's castle
can appear anywhere, Sypha.

16:58.809 --> 16:59.936
And I told you,

17:00.019 --> 17:02.605
this is what he looks like
on the inside.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.858
[man] And you know
what Dracula looks like?

17:05.942 --> 17:08.361
[Trevor, panting]
Nobody knows what Dracula looks like.

17:08.444 --> 17:11.739
You've got fangs,
and you sleep in a coffin.

17:11.822 --> 17:13.908
[Trevor groans]

17:13.991 --> 17:14.991
[whip cracks]

17:18.746 --> 17:19.746
[hisses]

17:21.707 --> 17:22.917
[man groans]

17:23.876 --> 17:24.877
[impact grunt]

17:27.380 --> 17:28.673
[grunts]

17:31.801 --> 17:33.344
[audibly struggling]

17:35.888 --> 17:37.348
[Trevor groans]

17:47.316 --> 17:48.317
[combat grunts]

17:52.405 --> 17:53.406
Aah!

18:07.044 --> 18:08.045
[grunts]

18:09.130 --> 18:10.923
[audibly straining]

18:15.886 --> 18:16.886
[grunts]

18:20.308 --> 18:22.810
Please. This isn't a bar fight.

18:22.893 --> 18:24.103
Have some class.

18:24.186 --> 18:25.313
[Trevor grunts]

18:26.439 --> 18:27.440
[Trevor groans]

18:28.858 --> 18:30.610
Aah!

18:30.693 --> 18:31.861
[groans]

18:33.946 --> 18:36.991
[combat grunts]

18:39.994 --> 18:41.162
[exertion grunt]

18:48.085 --> 18:49.085
[grunt]

18:53.341 --> 18:54.342
[Trevor groans]

18:54.425 --> 18:55.551
[vampiric hiss]

18:56.552 --> 18:59.555
Do you have a god
to put a last prayer to, Belmont?

18:59.639 --> 19:00.640
[grunts]

19:01.641 --> 19:03.392
Yeah.

19:03.476 --> 19:06.812
Dear God, please don't let
the vampire's guts

19:06.896 --> 19:08.689
ruin my good tunic.

19:08.773 --> 19:09.774
[man]
What?

19:09.857 --> 19:11.901
[pained grunts]

19:13.778 --> 19:16.322
I can still rip your throat out.

19:16.405 --> 19:20.076
You can, but it won't
stop me staking you.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.161
But you will still die.

19:22.244 --> 19:24.497
But I don't care.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.667
Killing you was the point.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.711
Living through it was just a luxury.

19:30.795 --> 19:33.422
[chuckles]

19:34.507 --> 19:35.675
[whoosh]

19:35.758 --> 19:37.510
[soft rush of flame]

19:37.593 --> 19:41.430
I will incinerate you before your fangs
touch that man's throat.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.516
I thought I was your legendary savior.

19:43.599 --> 19:44.809
So did I.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.520
But he saved my life.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.397
You're a Speaker-Magician.

19:49.480 --> 19:52.066
Yes, and his goal is mine...

19:52.149 --> 19:53.567
To stand up for the people.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.029
Good.

19:57.113 --> 19:58.739
Very good.

19:58.823 --> 20:00.491
A vampire hunter and a magician.

20:01.617 --> 20:02.660
You'll do.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.038
I am Adrian Tepes.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.083
Known to the Wallachians
as Alucard...

20:10.251 --> 20:13.713
son of Vlad Dracula Tepes.

20:13.796 --> 20:17.883
I've been asleep here in my private keep
under Gresit for a year,

20:17.967 --> 20:20.344
to heal the wounds dealt by my father

20:20.428 --> 20:22.972
when I attempted to stop him
unleashing his demon armies.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.808
You are the sleeping soldier.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.768
I'm aware of the stories.

20:27.852 --> 20:29.270
I'm also aware that the Speakers

20:29.353 --> 20:32.148
consider the story to be
information from the future.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.358
Do you know the whole story?

20:34.442 --> 20:35.776
Yes.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.070
The sleeping soldier
will be met by a hunter

20:38.154 --> 20:39.780
and a scholar.

20:39.864 --> 20:41.991
No one told me that.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.995
[Sypha] Why do you think my grandfather
tried everything to make you stay?

20:45.870 --> 20:47.663
I hate Speakers.

20:47.747 --> 20:48.831
[grunts]

20:56.255 --> 20:58.340
So, what happens now?

20:58.424 --> 21:01.010
I need a hunter and a scholar.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.012
I need help to save Wallachia...

21:03.095 --> 21:05.097
- [blade sings]
- perhaps the world...

21:05.181 --> 21:07.600
and defeat my father.

21:07.683 --> 21:08.976
Why?

21:11.479 --> 21:13.689
Because it is what my mother
would have wanted.

21:15.483 --> 21:17.485
And we are all, in the end...

21:18.486 --> 21:20.529
slaves to our families' wishes.

21:21.697 --> 21:25.367
You'll help us kill Dracula
and save Wallachia?

21:26.911 --> 21:29.497
My father has to die.

21:30.706 --> 21:31.707
We three...

21:33.501 --> 21:34.710
we can destroy him.

22:53.497 --> 22:54.707
[voice]
<i>Frederator!</i>
