No.

Well, get back out there.

And He does not love you.

I have done His bidding.

I now understand why it was you

04:45.577 --> 04:47.621
I didn't ask you to fight for me.

The man who will save us from Dracula.

13:29.642 --> 13:30.643
And you?

13:31.644 --> 13:33.813
Are you in search of a mythical savior?

13:33.896 --> 13:36.149
I fell down a hole.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.151
Dracula is abroad in the land.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.652
He has an army of monsters.

13:39.736 --> 13:42.780
He's determined to wipe out
all human life wherever he finds it.

13:42.864 --> 13:45.700
Is that what you believe?

13:45.783 --> 13:48.369
[Trevor] That Dracula's released
his horde in Wallachia?

13:48.453 --> 13:49.662
That's fact.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.956
There's no "belief" involved.

13:53.750 --> 13:54.876

No.

13:54.959 --> 13:59.380
You're asking if I believe you're
some sleeping messiah who'll save us,

13:59.464 --> 14:01.466
and no, I don't.

14:01.549 --> 14:02.800

I know what you are.

You're a vampire.

14:12.393 --> 14:13.393

14:14.479 --> 14:16.898
So, I have to ask myself,

14:16.981 --> 14:20.443
have we come down here
to wake up the man who'll kill Dracula,

14:20.526 --> 14:23.905
or did we come here to wake Dracula?

14:23.988 --> 14:25.907
You call me Dracula.

14:25.990 --> 14:29.285
[Trevor] I'll call you anything you like
if you're gonna show me your teeth.

14:37.543 --> 14:39.921
The Belmonts fought creatures

For generations.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.509
Say what you mean.

14:46.052 --> 14:47.970
The Belmonts killed vampires.

14:48.054 --> 14:52.225
Until the good people decided
they didn't want us around.

14:52.308 --> 14:55.561
And now Dracula is carrying out
an execution order on the human race.

14:56.521 --> 14:58.564
Do you care, Belmont?

15:00.691 --> 15:04.654
Honestly, I didn't, no.

15:04.737 --> 15:05.905
But now...

15:06.906 --> 15:10.368
yes, it's time to stop it.

15:12.620 --> 15:14.372
Do you think you can?

15:14.455 --> 15:17.959
What I think...
is I'm going to have to kill you.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.460
Belmont, no!

15:19.544 --> 15:21.087
He's the one we've been waiting for.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.588
No, he's not.

15:22.672 --> 15:23.881
He's a vampire.

15:23.965 --> 15:27.135
And he's not been waiting here
for hundreds of years, have you?

15:27.218 --> 15:29.429
I don't like your tone, Belmont.

15:29.512 --> 15:32.432
This place is old,
but it's not been abandoned.

15:32.515 --> 15:33.933
It's alive and working.

15:34.016 --> 15:35.977
So, go on, vampire,

15:36.060 --> 15:39.939
tell her exactly how long
you've been waiting down here.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.900
What is the year of your Lord?

15:42.984 --> 15:44.277
[Sypha]
1476.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.487
[man]
Perhaps a year, then.

15:46.571 --> 15:47.405
There.

15:47.488 --> 15:48.573
And on top of that,

15:48.656 --> 15:51.868
what kind of messiah creates
mechanical death traps

15:51.951 --> 15:54.787
to buy himself an uninterrupted nap

15:54.871 --> 15:56.664
in a stone coffin?

15:56.747 --> 15:58.458
My defenses were not for you.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.543
You could have told your defenses that.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.253
They are machines, nothing more.

16:02.336 --> 16:04.505
They were not intended
to protect me from you.

16:04.589 --> 16:06.716
I asked you a question...
Do you care?

16:07.800 --> 16:10.720
I care about doing my family's work.

16:10.803 --> 16:12.972
I care about saving human lives.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.558
Am I going to have to kill you?

16:15.641 --> 16:17.059
Do you think you can?

16:17.143 --> 16:20.247
If you're really a Belmont and not some
runt running around with a family crest,

16:20.271 --> 16:21.439
you might be able to.

16:26.402 --> 16:27.862
Let's find out.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.697
Belmont, you can't do this!

16:29.780 --> 16:32.450
Tell it to your floating
vampire Jesus here.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.494
You've got nothing but insults,
have you?

16:34.577 --> 16:35.578
A tired little...

16:35.661 --> 16:37.163
[whip cracks]

16:37.246 --> 16:38.247
[grunts]

16:38.331 --> 16:39.332
[low growl]

16:41.250 --> 16:42.543
[panting]

16:42.627 --> 16:45.254
[vampiric hiss]

16:45.338 --> 16:46.339
[grunts]

16:47.423 --> 16:49.175
Stone the fuck up.

16:49.258 --> 16:50.551
[whip whooshes]

16:50.635 --> 16:52.220
[blade rings]

16:52.303 --> 16:54.222
You can't do this, Belmont!

16:54.305 --> 16:56.015
[Trevor]
He's not your messiah.

16:56.098 --> 16:58.726
Dracula's castle
can appear anywhere, Sypha.

16:58.809 --> 16:59.936
And I told you,

17:00.019 --> 17:02.605
this is what he looks like
on the inside.

17:03.856 --> 17:05.858
[man] And you know
what Dracula looks like?

17:05.942 --> 17:08.361
[Trevor, panting]
Nobody knows what Dracula looks like.

17:08.444 --> 17:11.739
You've got fangs,
and you sleep in a coffin.

17:11.822 --> 17:13.908
[Trevor groans]

17:13.991 --> 17:14.991
[whip cracks]

17:18.746 --> 17:19.746
[hisses]

17:21.707 --> 17:22.917
[man groans]

17:23.876 --> 17:24.877
[impact grunt]

17:27.380 --> 17:28.673
[grunts]

17:31.801 --> 17:33.344
[audibly struggling]

17:35.888 --> 17:37.348
[Trevor groans]

17:47.316 --> 17:48.317
[combat grunts]

17:52.405 --> 17:53.406
Aah!

18:07.044 --> 18:08.045
[grunts]

18:09.130 --> 18:10.923
[audibly straining]

18:15.886 --> 18:16.886
[grunts]

18:20.308 --> 18:22.810
Please. This isn't a bar fight.

18:22.893 --> 18:24.103
Have some class.

18:24.186 --> 18:25.313
[Trevor grunts]

18:26.439 --> 18:27.440
[Trevor groans]

18:28.858 --> 18:30.610
Aah!

18:30.693 --> 18:31.861
[groans]

18:33.946 --> 18:36.991
[combat grunts]

18:39.994 --> 18:41.162
[exertion grunt]

18:48.085 --> 18:49.085
[grunt]

18:53.341 --> 18:54.342
[Trevor groans]

18:54.425 --> 18:55.551
[vampiric hiss]

18:56.552 --> 18:59.555
Do you have a god
to put a last prayer to, Belmont?

18:59.639 --> 19:00.640
[grunts]

19:01.641 --> 19:03.392
Yeah.

19:03.476 --> 19:06.812
Dear God, please don't let
the vampire's guts

19:06.896 --> 19:08.689
ruin my good tunic.

19:08.773 --> 19:09.774
[man]
What?

19:09.857 --> 19:11.901
[pained grunts]

19:13.778 --> 19:16.322
I can still rip your throat out.

19:16.405 --> 19:20.076
You can, but it won't
stop me staking you.

19:20.159 --> 19:22.161
But you will still die.

19:22.244 --> 19:24.497
But I don't care.

19:24.580 --> 19:27.667
Killing you was the point.

19:27.750 --> 19:30.711
Living through it was just a luxury.

19:30.795 --> 19:33.422
[chuckles]

19:34.507 --> 19:35.675
[whoosh]

19:35.758 --> 19:37.510
[soft rush of flame]

19:37.593 --> 19:41.430
I will incinerate you before your fangs
touch that man's throat.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.516
I thought I was your legendary savior.

19:43.599 --> 19:44.809
So did I.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.520
But he saved my life.

19:47.603 --> 19:49.397
You're a Speaker-Magician.

19:49.480 --> 19:52.066
Yes, and his goal is mine...

19:52.149 --> 19:53.567
To stand up for the people.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.029
Good.

19:57.113 --> 19:58.739
Very good.

19:58.823 --> 20:00.491
A vampire hunter and a magician.

20:01.617 --> 20:02.660
You'll do.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.038
I am Adrian Tepes.

20:07.039 --> 20:09.083
Known to the Wallachians
as Alucard...

20:10.251 --> 20:13.713
son of Vlad Dracula Tepes.

20:13.796 --> 20:17.883
I've been asleep here in my private keep
under Gresit for a year,

20:17.967 --> 20:20.344
to heal the wounds dealt by my father

20:20.428 --> 20:22.972
when I attempted to stop him
unleashing his demon armies.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.808
You are the sleeping soldier.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.768
I'm aware of the stories.

20:27.852 --> 20:29.270
I'm also aware that the Speakers

20:29.353 --> 20:32.148
consider the story to be
information from the future.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.358
Do you know the whole story?

20:34.442 --> 20:35.776
Yes.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.070
The sleeping soldier
will be met by a hunter

20:38.154 --> 20:39.780
and a scholar.

20:39.864 --> 20:41.991
No one told me that.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.995
[Sypha] Why do you think my grandfather
tried everything to make you stay?

20:45.870 --> 20:47.663
I hate Speakers.

20:47.747 --> 20:48.831
[grunts]

20:56.255 --> 20:58.340
So, what happens now?

20:58.424 --> 21:01.010
I need a hunter and a scholar.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.012
I need help to save Wallachia...

21:03.095 --> 21:05.097
- [blade sings]
- perhaps the world...

21:05.181 --> 21:07.600
and defeat my father.

21:07.683 --> 21:08.976
Why?

21:11.479 --> 21:13.689
Because it is what my mother
would have wanted.

21:15.483 --> 21:17.485
And we are all, in the end...

21:18.486 --> 21:20.529
slaves to our families' wishes.

21:21.697 --> 21:25.367
You'll help us kill Dracula
and save Wallachia?

21:26.911 --> 21:29.497
My father has to die.

21:30.706 --> 21:31.707
We three...

21:33.501 --> 21:34.710
we can destroy him.

22:53.497 --> 22:54.707
[voice]
<i>Frederator!</i>
