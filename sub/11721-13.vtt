12:55.745 --> 12:57.745
No one's telling us anything.

12:58.947 --> 13:01.415

13:22.605 --> 13:25.339

13:25.341 --> 13:27.374

13:27.376 --> 13:29.043

13:29.045 --> 13:31.812
My husband was supposed

13:31.814 --> 13:34.648
The CDC said he needed it
to survive.

13:34.650 --> 13:37.351
And we have every intention
of getting it to him.

13:37.353 --> 13:39.620
But you have to find him first.

13:39.622 --> 13:41.055
And he doesn't have

13:41.057 --> 13:42.256
much time.

13:43.225 --> 13:45.759
I'm gonna find your husband,
Mrs. Lange.

13:45.761 --> 13:47.094

Who is he?

14:29.739 --> 14:31.071
John Doe for now.

14:31.073 --> 14:33.440
No hits on AFIS
or CODIS.

14:33.442 --> 14:34.575
However, I did find

14:34.577 --> 14:36.710
foreign substances
that he recently inhaled

14:36.712 --> 14:39.246
in his nostrils
and his respiratory system.

14:39.248 --> 14:41.582
I sent them over
to the crime lab for analysis.

14:41.584 --> 14:44.385
The results were charred burlap
and pine needles.

14:45.654 --> 14:47.621
Any idea where they came from?

14:47.623 --> 14:49.223
Could have been
from a number of sources.

14:49.225 --> 14:53.093
He could've been near
a campfire or at a fireplace.

14:53.095 --> 14:55.262
Okay, let's look into
more possible sources.

14:55.264 --> 14:56.264
Anything else?

14:56.265 --> 14:58.999
Yes. I also performed
a full CT scan

14:59.001 --> 15:01.135
on the body.
As you can see,

15:01.137 --> 15:04.271
he has a remarkable amount
of shrapnel in his body.

15:04.273 --> 15:05.606
This guy's
seen battle.

15:05.608 --> 15:08.142
If he's U.S. military,
his prints would be on AFIS.

15:08.144 --> 15:10.544
All right, we need to get
his photograph to Interpol

15:10.546 --> 15:13.047
and every antiterrorist agency.

15:13.049 --> 15:15.883
Somebody has to be able
to I.D. this guy.

15:15.885 --> 15:17.251
<i>Chin, Kono,</i>

15:17.253 --> 15:19.820
<i>this is Dr. Nalani Dyer.</i>

15:19.822 --> 15:21.789
She's the Honolulu
CDC station director.

15:21.791 --> 15:23.824
What do you have
for us, Doctor?

15:23.826 --> 15:26.460
I'm afraid to say we've
confirmed there was a breach

15:26.462 --> 15:28.228
of the DHS server.

15:28.230 --> 15:30.030
Confidential e-mails
were compromised.

15:30.032 --> 15:32.132
We believe
that's how your suspects

15:32.134 --> 15:33.667
obtained the transport Intel.

15:33.669 --> 15:35.903
Do you know
where the breach came from?

15:35.905 --> 15:38.539
Unfortunately, they left
no digital footprint.

15:38.541 --> 15:40.941
But DHS agrees
with your assessment

15:40.943 --> 15:42.676
this is an act of terrorism.

15:42.678 --> 15:45.145
POTUS has given us
the go-ahead to raise

15:45.147 --> 15:47.081
the NTAS Alert level
to Imminent Threat.

15:47.083 --> 15:49.049
So, Doctor,
what do we know

15:49.051 --> 15:50.517
about this virus?

15:50.519 --> 15:53.721
It's a mutated strain
of the avian flu.

15:53.723 --> 15:55.522
About six weeks ago, a farmer

15:55.524 --> 15:57.991
in the Davao region of the
Philippines came down with it.

15:57.993 --> 16:01.061
One week later,
we reported 105 cases.

16:01.063 --> 16:02.896
As of 7:00 a.m.
this morning,

16:02.898 --> 16:07.368
we have 1,400 cases,
1,315 deaths.

16:10.939 --> 16:12.072
Okay, how's it transmitted?

16:12.074 --> 16:14.975
As far we know, only through
direct human contact.

16:14.977 --> 16:17.945
Once you're infected,
the incubation period

16:17.947 --> 16:21.248
has been shown to be anywhere
from a few hours to 21 days.

16:21.250 --> 16:24.885
After symptoms appear, patients
usually die within five days.

16:24.887 --> 16:26.553
So I guess that flu shot
I just got

16:26.555 --> 16:28.155
isn't gonna cover this.

16:28.157 --> 16:29.323
We've been working on a serum.

16:29.325 --> 16:31.692
Mitch Lange was due
to receive it this afternoon.

16:31.694 --> 16:34.461
If he doesn't get it soon,
he'll be dead tomorrow.

16:34.463 --> 16:35.729
Doctor, any idea

16:35.731 --> 16:37.698
how one might weaponize
this virus?

16:37.700 --> 16:40.968
Well, Lange is too ill

16:40.970 --> 16:44.371
to send into a crowded area
without raising suspicion.

16:44.373 --> 16:46.940
So they'd use his blood.

16:46.942 --> 16:49.076
Which is no easy task.

16:49.078 --> 16:51.745
They'd need an expert
to keep the virus stable

16:51.747 --> 16:55.696
and a biosafety level 4
lab to work in.

16:55.696 --> 16:57.296
Is there
one of those labs on the island?

16:57.297 --> 16:59.653
No. There are only 15
in the United States.

16:59.655 --> 17:02.623
Closest one to here
is in Montana.

17:02.625 --> 17:04.057
Unless they
built their own.

17:04.059 --> 17:06.660
It's possible.
But they'd need

17:06.662 --> 17:08.694
very specific equipment.

17:08.696 --> 17:10.396
Positive pressure
personnel suits,

17:10.398 --> 17:12.132
decontamination chemicals,

17:12.134 --> 17:14.501
an uninterrupted
power supply,

17:14.502 --> 17:16.336
- just for starters.
- Well, that's good.

17:16.338 --> 17:18.204
Not exactly a run-of-the-mill
trip to Home Depot.

17:18.207 --> 17:19.573
All right,
we need to track down

17:19.575 --> 17:21.642
any recent purchases of
this kind of equipment.

17:21.644 --> 17:23.109
If we can find a buyer,

17:23.112 --> 17:24.478
could lead us to Lange.

18:55.069 --> 18:57.604
I bet you're reconsidering
that retirement right about now.

18:57.606 --> 19:01.475
There's nothing else
I would rather be doing.

19:01.477 --> 19:03.577
Oh, yeah. I figured
you'd say that.

19:03.579 --> 19:05.012
Don't worry,
I won't die

19:05.014 --> 19:07.748
before I tell you
what you want to know.

19:09.250 --> 19:13.186
Look, Steve, I already
reached out to my contacts.

19:13.188 --> 19:15.422
These guys know the handlers
that your mother reports to.

19:15.424 --> 19:17.224
They'll find her.

19:17.226 --> 19:19.092
That was fast.

19:19.094 --> 19:21.562
Wrong guys.
Yeah.

19:21.564 --> 19:25.799
Walt, appreciate
you getting back to me.

19:25.801 --> 19:27.734
Mahalo.

19:27.736 --> 19:30.137
No, that's Hawaiian
for thank you.

19:30.139 --> 19:32.005
You got to get out
of the Beltway more, man.

19:32.007 --> 19:34.007
What do you got?
Homeland Security contact

19:34.009 --> 19:37.044
came through.
They got a hit on our John Doe.

19:37.046 --> 19:38.078
All right.

19:39.181 --> 19:41.381
His name is Zahir Morina.

19:41.383 --> 19:43.750
He joined the Kosovo Liberation
Army when he was old enough

19:43.752 --> 19:45.519
to carry a gun, and he served

19:45.521 --> 19:47.621
till the KLA disbanded in '99.

19:47.623 --> 19:49.056
Well, it's good to see
he's kept busy.

19:49.058 --> 19:50.324
He's got a red notice
on Interpol.

19:50.326 --> 19:52.659
Everything from murder
and extortion to armed robbery.

19:52.661 --> 19:55.162
So either he's joined up
with a new terrorist group,

19:55.164 --> 19:57.097
or the KLA just made
a hell of a comeback.

19:57.099 --> 20:00.334
DHS classifies the KLA as an
inactive terrorist organization,

20:00.336 --> 20:01.802
so if they were
in a rebuilding mode,

20:01.804 --> 20:03.370
we'd have heard something.

20:03.372 --> 20:04.905
I just got off
the phone with Oahu

20:04.907 --> 20:06.907
State University.
One of their professors,

20:06.909 --> 20:11.044
a Dr. Howard Rennick, head of
virology, purchased $30,000

20:11.046 --> 20:13.814
worth of lab equipment
in the past 72 hours,

20:13.816 --> 20:16.516
all materials needed to build
your very own level 4 lab.

20:16.518 --> 20:18.585
Is there any chance
he needed that stuff

20:18.587 --> 20:19.720
for work?
The university

20:19.722 --> 20:21.154
didn't authorize it if he did.

20:21.156 --> 20:22.356
And apparently Rennick

20:22.358 --> 20:24.024
hasn't shown up for class
in three days.

20:24.026 --> 20:28.562
Maybe because he's busy
weaponizing a virus.

20:36.704 --> 20:39.239
Either we're right
about our virus doctor,

20:39.241 --> 20:41.008
or this guy
really doesn't like company.

20:41.010 --> 20:43.243
We need to find
another way in.

20:43.845 --> 20:45.746
Cover me! Moving!

20:55.056 --> 20:56.156
What the hell is he doing?

20:56.158 --> 20:58.058
Exactly what I'd do.

21:01.329 --> 21:03.330
Well, I guess that settles it.

21:03.332 --> 21:04.965
What?

21:04.967 --> 21:06.967
You weren't really born
a crazy son of a bitch.

21:06.969 --> 21:09.102
This is the guy that taught you.

21:14.877 --> 21:17.077
Clear!

21:23.685 --> 21:25.686
Who are these guys?

21:25.688 --> 21:27.020
Beside
from being pro gun,

21:27.022 --> 21:28.822
no idea.
So where's Rennick?

21:30.793 --> 21:33.760
On me.

22:07.762 --> 22:09.896
Mrs. Rennick?
Yes.

22:09.898 --> 22:11.331
Where's your husband?
They took him.

22:11.333 --> 22:14.067
Who? Who took him?
I don't know.

22:29.594 --> 22:31.094
Was this one
of the guys?

22:31.096 --> 22:33.397
Yeah, that was
one of them.

22:33.399 --> 22:35.365
Thanks.

22:37.468 --> 22:39.136
How is she?

22:39.138 --> 22:41.605
She's uh, she's
pretty shaken up,

22:41.607 --> 22:43.573
but I think she's
gonna be all right.

22:43.575 --> 22:46.076
Said six armed gunmen
stormed the house

22:46.078 --> 22:49.146
<i>three days ago.</i>
What the hell is Th...

22:49.148 --> 22:50.947
<i>They threatened to kill her</i>
<i>if Dr. Rennick</i>

22:50.949 --> 22:52.582
<i>didn't go with them.</i>
<i>She just I.D.'d</i>

22:52.584 --> 22:55.118
<i>Zahir Morina</i>
<i>as one of the crew.</i>

22:55.120 --> 22:56.987
So the same crew
that grabbed Mitch Lange

22:56.989 --> 22:58.955
also took Dr. Rennick
and used his credit card

22:58.957 --> 23:01.525
and medical license to
acquire the lab equipment.

23:01.527 --> 23:03.326
Right, and his wife
is the leverage

23:03.328 --> 23:05.729
to make sure he does
exactly what they want.

23:08.866 --> 23:11.802
<i>Now, the fact that she's</i>
<i>still alive says to me</i>

23:11.804 --> 23:15.005
<i>Rennick has not finished</i>
<i>weaponizing the virus.</i>

23:15.007 --> 23:17.340
We need confirmation that Rennick
is capable of doing the job,

23:17.342 --> 23:18.475
otherwise
they're gonna kill him

23:18.477 --> 23:19.810
and get somebody else
who is.

23:19.812 --> 23:20.844
Guys...

23:20.846 --> 23:23.613
take a look at this.

23:23.615 --> 23:27.084
Did facial rec
on our two dead shooters.

23:27.086 --> 23:29.553
Both got flagged by Interpol.

23:29.555 --> 23:31.254
Who are they?

23:31.256 --> 23:33.790
Leka Bogdani, Remzi Kostin.

23:33.792 --> 23:36.259
Bogdani
is ex-Albanian armed forces

23:36.261 --> 23:39.529
and Kostin-- ex-Russian
ground forces.

23:39.531 --> 23:41.298
Which can only mean one thing--
they're mercenaries.

23:41.300 --> 23:43.333
All right, we need
to find out who put this

23:43.335 --> 23:45.102
all-star team
of scumbags together.

23:45.104 --> 23:47.104
Is there any connection
between these two?

23:47.106 --> 23:49.272
I might have found one.
Back in the 90s

23:49.274 --> 23:51.308
they were all CIA assets.

23:51.310 --> 23:53.143
And their handler was

23:53.145 --> 23:56.379
an ex-field operative named Michael Carson.
Michael Carson.

23:56.381 --> 23:58.782
What, you know him, Joe?

23:58.784 --> 24:00.684
I met him years ago.

24:00.686 --> 24:02.786
Carson was part
of a CIA recon team

24:02.788 --> 24:04.955
in the early years
of the Afghan war.

24:04.957 --> 24:07.390
He turned that conflict
into his own personal ATM,

24:07.392 --> 24:09.760
until things went sideways
and they put him away for

24:09.762 --> 24:11.962
trying to smuggle gold
back into the States.

24:11.964 --> 24:13.396
That was 15 years ago.

24:13.398 --> 24:16.366
It says here he was
released from Allenwood

24:16.368 --> 24:17.968
over a year ago, and there's
no record of anything

24:17.970 --> 24:19.936
he's been up to since.
Well, we know what he's up to--

24:19.938 --> 24:21.772
he's putting a team
of old contacts together

24:21.774 --> 24:23.473
to steal a bioweapon.

24:23.475 --> 24:24.975
All right,
we need to find out

24:24.977 --> 24:27.344
who hired Carson
to weaponize this virus.

24:27.346 --> 24:29.713
And hope they haven't
paid him to release it, too.

24:29.715 --> 24:31.081
You know,

24:31.083 --> 24:32.783
that might be the play.

24:32.785 --> 24:34.718
Before he joined the agency,

24:34.720 --> 24:37.053
he was part
of a counterterrorism op.

24:37.055 --> 24:39.489
He used to oversee
a think tank of scientists

24:39.491 --> 24:42.459
who were running these
biowarfare scenarios.

24:42.461 --> 24:43.994
Everything from
anthrax in the mail

24:43.996 --> 24:45.495
to sarin gas
in the subways.

24:45.497 --> 24:48.365
Pretty much the worst
kind of stuff you can think of.

24:49.667 --> 24:51.234
Maybe one of those scenarios
could be Carson's

24:51.236 --> 24:52.702
next move.

24:52.704 --> 24:55.338
Dr. Rennick isn't
just a colleague.

24:55.340 --> 24:56.640
He's been a mentor to me.

24:56.642 --> 24:58.842
He's also the best
virologist I know.

24:58.844 --> 25:00.143
All right, um...

25:00.145 --> 25:03.580
this is a silly question, but,
uh, is he capable of, uh,

25:03.582 --> 25:06.016
weaponizing H5N4?

25:06.018 --> 25:08.118
Honestly?

25:08.120 --> 25:10.086
Yes.

25:10.088 --> 25:11.788
If anyone can pull
it off, it's him.

25:11.790 --> 25:14.991
Okay, so...
how would he do that?

25:14.993 --> 25:18.328
Theoretically, he could use a
process called lyophilization.

25:18.330 --> 25:22.065
I'm gonna stop you right there, 'cause...
It's essentially freeze-drying.

25:22.067 --> 25:23.333
Okay.

25:23.335 --> 25:24.534
Like when they make
astronaut food?

25:24.536 --> 25:26.736
Exactly. It extends
the shelf life of vaccines,

25:26.738 --> 25:28.705
but it can also
be used on viruses.

25:28.707 --> 25:31.308
Turns them into a fine white
powder which can be inhaled,

25:31.310 --> 25:33.677
ingested or otherwise
transmitted.

25:33.679 --> 25:36.580
All you need is a delivery
system and you got yourself

25:36.582 --> 25:37.914
a biological weapon.

25:37.916 --> 25:39.015
Uh-huh.

25:39.017 --> 25:41.685
And how long
would it take, uh, to turn

25:41.687 --> 25:43.520
the avian flu
into something like that?

25:43.522 --> 25:45.789
Hard to say for sure.

25:45.791 --> 25:47.757
If I had to guess...

25:47.759 --> 25:49.826
no more than 12 hours.

25:53.197 --> 25:55.365
But this is all
theoretical, right?

25:56.500 --> 25:57.567
Mm.

25:57.569 --> 25:59.436
You do understand that if

25:59.438 --> 26:00.904
there's a widespread
outbreak of this virus,

26:00.906 --> 26:03.440
we'd be looking
at a slate wiper.

26:03.442 --> 26:06.276
Slate wiper?
From all the projections we've done,

26:06.278 --> 26:08.578
a weaponized H5N4
would decimate

26:08.580 --> 26:10.580
the population.

26:10.582 --> 26:12.215
Of Oahu?

26:12.217 --> 26:14.517
The world.

26:36.307 --> 26:38.642
Do you want to call Grace?

26:38.644 --> 26:39.976
And tell her what, exactly?

26:39.978 --> 26:42.445
Hey, honey, there's
this nut job out there

26:42.447 --> 26:44.514
and he's trying to wipe out
the entire population...

26:44.516 --> 26:47.083
just to, uh, make some money.

26:48.686 --> 26:51.288
What's the point?
If that doctor's right,

26:51.290 --> 26:52.622
the virus is already
being weaponized--

26:52.624 --> 26:53.857
what difference
does it make?

26:53.859 --> 26:55.558
Okay, then we're gonna
have to find out

26:55.560 --> 26:56.760
how it's being distributed,

26:56.762 --> 26:59.296
'cause that's the only way
we're gonna stop it.

27:04.735 --> 27:06.903
Impressive resume, Mr. Kula.

27:11.142 --> 27:13.209
I think you'll fit in
nicely around here.

27:13.211 --> 27:15.345
If you wouldn't mind
waiting a minute,

27:15.347 --> 27:17.747
I'll get somebody from senior
management to show you around.

27:20.519 --> 27:22.953

28:06.530 --> 28:07.664
Hey, uh...

28:07.666 --> 28:09.366
I think you got
a problem in here.

28:09.368 --> 28:11.668
There's bees
coming in through the vent.

28:37.428 --> 28:39.763
Help!

28:39.765 --> 28:41.031
Open the door!

28:44.368 --> 28:46.803
Please!

28:46.805 --> 28:49.039

28:52.810 --> 28:55.078

<i>I've been looking into</i>

29:47.101 --> 29:49.869
biowarfare scenarios
that Carson was familiar with.

29:49.871 --> 29:50.936
Now given his
training, there are

29:50.938 --> 29:52.204
several viable means
of distribution.

29:52.206 --> 29:55.307
Dirty bombs,
ventilation systems,

29:55.309 --> 29:57.142
even bees.

29:57.144 --> 29:59.311
<i>Bees?</i>

29:59.313 --> 30:00.446
<i>Yeah, they're a viable</i>
<i>distribution system.</i>

30:00.448 --> 30:02.481
<i>We used to run scenarios</i>
<i>using bees</i>

30:02.483 --> 30:04.283
<i>with substances</i>
<i>like anthrax.</i>

30:05.552 --> 30:07.019
The powder adheres
to their wings.

30:07.021 --> 30:10.523
Once they're released,
they spread the virus.

30:10.525 --> 30:11.624
Making it airborne.

30:11.626 --> 30:13.926
Right.
Wait a minute, hold on--

30:13.928 --> 30:15.895
Max found charred burlap

30:15.897 --> 30:17.863
and pine needles
in Morina's lungs.

30:17.865 --> 30:20.666
Which could be used in a bee smoker.
Well, that's just great.

30:20.668 --> 30:23.469
Why don't we just
put an APB out on every bee

30:23.471 --> 30:25.404
on the island and
everything'll be just fine.

30:25.406 --> 30:27.339
Actually,
that's not a bad idea.

30:27.341 --> 30:28.707
Commerce of bees
is heavily monitored

30:28.709 --> 30:29.942
on the island.
They're illegal to import

30:29.944 --> 30:32.177
and there are only
a few places to buy them.

30:32.179 --> 30:34.346
Given that Carson needs
an uninterrupted power supply,

30:34.348 --> 30:36.749
I'll cross-reference
any recent spikes

30:36.751 --> 30:38.117
in kilowatt-hours

local company--

41:20.844 --> 41:22.210
they have
agricultural clearance

41:22.212 --> 41:24.045
to ship their honeybees
across the country.

41:24.047 --> 41:26.414
His financials tied him
to a new terror group

41:26.416 --> 41:27.915
out of the Middle East.

41:27.917 --> 41:31.619
DHS got them at Dulles
airport waiting for the bees to arrive.

41:40.329 --> 41:41.562

41:47.737 --> 41:49.070

42:04.220 --> 42:06.153

42:12.028 --> 42:13.661

42:13.663 --> 42:15.196
Oh, yeah?

42:15.198 --> 42:17.031

that Doris was supposed

42:17.033 --> 42:19.867
to check in with her handlers
36 hours ago, but she never did.

42:19.869 --> 42:21.602
What happened?
We don't know.

42:21.604 --> 42:24.038
It can only mean one
of two things: either...

42:24.040 --> 42:26.240
she's dead...

42:28.076 --> 42:30.578
...or she went off the grid;
and knowing your mother,

42:30.580 --> 42:33.014
if she doesn't want
to be found, she won't be.

42:36.285 --> 42:39.487

we're looking for her.

42:41.456 --> 42:43.357
