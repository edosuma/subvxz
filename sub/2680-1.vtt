02:05.583 --> 02:07.043
Pass it left to Jack!

02:07.085 --> 02:08.669
Pass the bloody thing,
Tom!

02:08.710 --> 02:09.919
Tom, pass it left!

02:10.002 --> 02:11.755
Pass the ball!
Come on, Tom!

02:11.839 --> 02:12.422
To Jack!

02:12.548 --> 02:13.507
Go on, Tom!

02:18.512 --> 02:19.596
Tom!

02:21.223 --> 02:23.100
What's that man's name?!

02:28.188 --> 02:29.522
You see the girls, Jack?

02:32.901 --> 02:35.528
Push on!
Move it, boys! Come on!

02:37.614 --> 02:39.032
Stand tall!

02:39.074 --> 02:40.075
There you go... straight.

02:41.575 --> 02:42.409
Go on, Vicar!

02:42.535 --> 02:43.494
Sean! Sean!

02:47.957 --> 02:49.500
Go on... keep going!

03:04.973 --> 03:05.766
Break it up!

03:09.311 --> 03:10.729
I need you on the field, lad.

03:10.812 --> 03:11.980
- Huh?
- You're all right.

03:18.319 --> 03:21.114
Behind you!

03:23.700 --> 03:24.993
Jack!

03:25.994 --> 03:26.744
Take it, Jack!

03:41.800 --> 03:44.136
Well done, old chap!

03:44.178 --> 03:45.137
Well done, Jack.

03:45.179 --> 03:47.431
Is there anything else left
in there?

03:59.151 --> 04:01.403
How long you going to be
in that bathtub, Vicar?

04:01.486 --> 04:02.404
As long as I like.

04:02.487 --> 04:04.906
Stand tall, Vicar.

04:07.783 --> 04:09.744
Idiot!

04:11.037 --> 04:12.914
Willoughby, you look wonderful,
darling.

04:12.997 --> 04:13.915
Princess Willoughby.

04:13.956 --> 04:14.957
Miss Willoughby.

04:15.041 --> 04:16.541
Hey, Tom, there's a hair
out of place there, boy.

04:16.625 --> 04:18.795
When are you gentlemen
going to grow up?

04:18.878 --> 04:20.713
"Gentlemen"? Did he
just call us "gentlemen"?

04:20.797 --> 04:21.714
I believe he did.

04:21.798 --> 04:23.548
- I won't take that from anyone.
- Nor will I.

04:23.632 --> 04:26.134
I like when you do this.

04:26.218 --> 04:27.177
Not my hair!

04:27.261 --> 04:28.846
- Willoughby, this is...
- Not the hair!

04:28.929 --> 04:30.556
Not the hair!

04:34.351 --> 04:35.745
And don't think we're going
to take you any more seriously

04:35.747 --> 04:37.188
once you're promoted,
Miss Willoughby.

04:37.188 --> 04:39.690
- We'll see about that.
- Whoo!

04:39.772 --> 04:41.858
Ladies.

04:41.941 --> 04:43.943
Don't worry, Vicar,
they're only women.

04:43.985 --> 04:44.944
They won't bite.

04:44.986 --> 04:45.987
Just be quiet.

04:59.542 --> 05:00.668
Does it hurt?

05:00.751 --> 05:03.963
Uh... yes.

05:04.004 --> 05:05.339
What are you two lovebirds
laughing about?

05:05.423 --> 05:06.382
His eye.

05:06.424 --> 05:07.717
Don't fall for it.

05:07.800 --> 05:09.010
He colors it in with a pen.

05:09.093 --> 05:11.512
I can draw you one
if you're feeling left out.

05:11.554 --> 05:13.680
Go on, then.

05:13.722 --> 05:15.182
What?

05:15.223 --> 05:18.477
Well, I want a black eye
like Jack's.

05:18.560 --> 05:21.980
If you really want one, Harry,
I... can facilitate you.

05:22.064 --> 05:23.315
Want a second black eye, Jack?

05:23.398 --> 05:24.441
No.

05:28.612 --> 05:30.405
That's good.

05:48.422 --> 05:49.715
Are you nervous?

05:49.798 --> 05:50.883
Stop it.

05:50.924 --> 05:52.718
What?

05:52.760 --> 05:54.303
What are you two doing?

05:54.386 --> 05:56.347
Nothing.

05:57.973 --> 06:00.059
I want to dance.

06:00.100 --> 06:04.562
Not up there, Ethne. Now, Ethne,
come down from there, please.

06:04.604 --> 06:07.482
Not until you dance with me,
Harry.

06:07.565 --> 06:09.317
Oh, dear, yes, come down, Ethne.

06:09.401 --> 06:10.819
- For God's sake, be careful.
- Oh, please.

06:10.902 --> 06:11.903
Jack, tell her to get down.

06:11.945 --> 06:13.196
When does she ever listen to me?

06:13.280 --> 06:15.407
Ethne, listen to Jack, please.

06:15.448 --> 06:16.616
Relax, Harry.

06:16.700 --> 06:17.617
Listen to me.

06:17.701 --> 06:18.910
Thank you, Jack.

06:18.952 --> 06:19.953
I will not pirouette.

06:19.995 --> 06:21.246
Dance with me.

06:21.288 --> 06:22.288
Right, right.

06:25.833 --> 06:27.585
- Oh, my God.
- Scary, isn't it, Harry?

06:27.668 --> 06:29.462
Don't be such a bore, Harry.

06:31.297 --> 06:32.215
I'm trying.

06:32.298 --> 06:33.216
Ooh! Ooh!

06:34.134 --> 06:37.261
Please be careful, okay?
It's not very funny, Ethne.

06:37.345 --> 06:38.553
Excuse me, Mr. Faversham, sir.

06:38.637 --> 06:43.600
Your father is asking
for you and Miss Eustace.

06:43.642 --> 06:44.893
Oh.

06:44.977 --> 06:46.353
Thank you.

06:50.858 --> 06:52.735
- Sir.
- Sir.

06:52.818 --> 06:53.736
Colonel Sutch.

06:53.819 --> 06:54.737
Harry, my boy.

06:54.820 --> 06:55.178
How are you, sir?

06:55.178 --> 06:56.821
Well, well. Mum.

06:56.904 --> 06:57.906
Colonel Sutch.

06:57.989 --> 06:59.908
I'm sorry to send for you,
my dear.

06:59.991 --> 07:02.368
I was hoping to steal you
for the last dance.

07:02.452 --> 07:07.123
It'd be my pleasure, General.
Your son won't dance with me.

07:08.541 --> 07:10.126
Where were you?

07:10.210 --> 07:13.170
Catching a breath of air, sir.

07:18.175 --> 07:19.552
My dear.

07:25.349 --> 07:29.603
She is very beautiful, Harry.

07:29.686 --> 07:32.230
Yes, she is, sir.

07:32.314 --> 07:35.025
I was thinking how proud my
father would be if he were here.

07:35.066 --> 07:37.611
An officer who gave his life
for his country

07:37.694 --> 07:39.905
deserves far more respect
than I do.

07:39.988 --> 07:42.032
I wish I'd met him.

07:46.327 --> 07:48.788
Are you ready, my dear?

07:50.706 --> 07:52.542
With all my heart.

07:59.882 --> 08:02.844
My lords, ladies and gentlemen,
the general.

08:11.518 --> 08:14.021
Dr. Johnson once said

08:14.104 --> 08:18.818
every man feels meanly about himself
for not having been a soldier.

08:18.859 --> 08:22.112
Well, that's something
no one here tonight need fear.

08:22.195 --> 08:24.531
Whether or not you've seen
active service

08:24.614 --> 08:28.585
you have shown yourselves
willing to lay down your lives

08:28.588 --> 08:30.036
and for that...

08:30.078 --> 08:31.872
I salute you.

08:31.955 --> 08:35.542
- The Royal Cumbrians!
- The Royal Cumbrians!

08:40.254 --> 08:44.008
Now, in my mind, there is
only one sacrifice more noble

08:44.091 --> 08:46.928
than pledging one's life
for one's country

08:46.969 --> 08:51.349
and that is... loving...

08:51.432 --> 08:54.059
and marrying a man who does.

08:54.101 --> 08:55.060
- Marry?!
- Marry?!

08:55.102 --> 08:58.730
Harry... and Ethne.

08:58.772 --> 09:00.274
Harry and Ethne!

09:04.778 --> 09:05.529
Bravo!

09:05.612 --> 09:08.699
Bravo! Bravo!

09:24.464 --> 09:25.590
Form a square!

09:27.342 --> 09:28.801
Form a square!

10:29.193 --> 10:32.154
Well, now that we've had
such a public engagement

10:32.196 --> 10:34.698
can we have a nice,
quiet wedding, please?

10:34.782 --> 10:36.199
Not on your life!

10:36.241 --> 10:39.494
I want the full works,
the church near my home

10:39.536 --> 10:42.622
and then a rousing speech
from your father.

10:42.664 --> 10:43.999
Mm.

10:44.040 --> 10:45.000
My father?

10:45.041 --> 10:46.167
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

10:46.209 --> 10:48.503
"I'd like
to congratulate my son.

10:48.545 --> 10:52.507
When I was his age, I was
in charge of a full regiment."

10:52.591 --> 10:54.133
He doesn't sound
anything like that.

10:54.216 --> 10:55.134
Oh, yes, he does.

10:55.217 --> 10:57.511
Besides, you will be
in charge of a regiment.

11:04.435 --> 11:05.853
Quiet!

11:05.895 --> 11:06.938
It'll be Jack and Isabelle's
turn next.

11:07.021 --> 11:08.856
Jack? Oh, no,
Jack will never get married.

11:08.898 --> 11:10.148
He's too much of a soldier.

11:10.232 --> 11:11.024
So are you.

11:11.108 --> 11:13.151
Yes, but not like him.

11:13.235 --> 11:17.531
Yes, you are, more than him,
more than any of them.

11:17.614 --> 11:19.825
You're my husband.

11:19.908 --> 11:21.535
Good night, ladies

11:21.618 --> 11:23.787
Good night, ladies...

11:23.871 --> 11:24.955
Go away.

11:25.038 --> 11:26.206
Please, ignore them.

11:26.290 --> 11:27.749
Don't act like children!

11:27.790 --> 11:31.377
Merrily, we roll along,
roll along, roll along

11:31.419 --> 11:34.380
Merrily, we roll along
until the morning comes

11:34.422 --> 11:37.800
Good night, gentlemen,
good night, gentlemen...

11:37.884 --> 11:39.803
Good night, Ethne!

11:39.886 --> 11:42.222
Good night, Harry!

11:42.263 --> 11:46.266
Good night, Ethne,
we have to take him home!

11:52.106 --> 11:53.566
Hyah! Hyah!

11:59.947 --> 12:01.990
Come on, Harry, keep up!

12:03.909 --> 12:05.869
Come on, John!

12:17.255 --> 12:20.091
Come on, Mr. Castleton,
get it out!

12:20.132 --> 12:21.259
Mr. Trench, carry on!

12:21.300 --> 12:24.178
Mr. Castleton's dead...
enemy spear through the foot!

12:24.262 --> 12:25.263
Come on, get a move on!

12:25.346 --> 12:26.764
Get it out!

12:28.307 --> 12:30.476
Come on, let's go! Come on!

12:41.904 --> 12:44.198
Gentlemen, the colonel!

12:55.250 --> 12:56.417
Gentlemen.

12:57.669 --> 12:58.795
I have some news.

12:58.878 --> 13:03.466
An army of Muhammadan fanatics
under the command

13:03.550 --> 13:07.637
of their self-proclaimed
messiah, the Mahdi

13:07.721 --> 13:12.057
has attacked a British fortress
in the Sudan.

13:12.141 --> 13:14.477
Our forces there fought a heroic

13:14.560 --> 13:18.488
but in the end hopeless,
rearguard action.

13:19.482 --> 13:22.902
They were slaughtered to a man.

13:22.985 --> 13:26.238
As a result of these hostilities

13:26.321 --> 13:31.159
several regiments,
including the Royal Cumbrians

13:31.243 --> 13:35.330
will be shipping out
to the Sudan within the week.

13:35.414 --> 13:38.500
Congratulations to you all.

13:38.584 --> 13:44.464
This government has finally seen
fit to send its soldiers to war.

13:51.346 --> 13:52.513
Finally, we're off.

13:54.265 --> 13:55.433
Gentlemen.

13:58.269 --> 14:02.356
God has endowed

14:02.439 --> 14:04.274
the British race

14:04.358 --> 14:07.027
with a worldwide empire

14:07.111 --> 14:12.700
that they may execute His
sovereign purpose in the world.

14:12.783 --> 14:22.000
The victories you will have over the heathen
are the victories of the nobler soul in man.

14:22.083 --> 14:26.171
- God save the queen.
- God save the queen!

14:35.930 --> 14:37.014
All together!

14:37.098 --> 14:40.309
This is what nerves do
to grown men.

14:40.393 --> 14:44.730
If we're going to go to war,
I wish we'd just get on with it.

14:44.772 --> 14:47.358
Do you ever think
about what it's going to be like

14:47.483 --> 14:49.652
when we get there?

14:49.736 --> 14:51.695
All the time.

14:51.778 --> 14:53.363
Don't you?

14:53.447 --> 14:55.073
I sometimes wonder

14:55.115 --> 14:58.327
what a godforsaken desert
in the middle of nowhere

14:58.410 --> 15:00.120
has to do
with Her Majesty the queen.

15:02.956 --> 15:04.249
What's going on?

15:04.291 --> 15:05.292
What happened?

15:05.334 --> 15:08.086
Aren't you afraid
you won't come back?

15:08.169 --> 15:12.590
Did you have a bad dream
about me or something?

15:12.632 --> 15:16.593
Did I get my head lopped off
by one of those Mahdi savages?

15:16.677 --> 15:19.931
- Yes, Jack.
- Of course, I'm scared.

15:19.973 --> 15:22.434
Then, what...

15:25.269 --> 15:26.604
...what makes you go?

15:26.687 --> 15:30.941
I suppose... I'm going

15:30.983 --> 15:32.318
because you're going...

15:32.443 --> 15:37.114
you, Trench, Castleton,
even Willoughby...

15:37.198 --> 15:39.825
but especially you.

15:41.868 --> 15:44.871
There's no one
I'd sooner trust my life with.

16:44.179 --> 16:45.138
What is this?

16:45.180 --> 16:47.099
My papers, sir.

16:47.182 --> 16:50.351
If it's leave you want,
there's a different procedure.

16:50.434 --> 16:53.521
Normally I wouldn't consider it
in the circumstances

16:53.604 --> 16:55.856
but given that you've
just got engaged...

16:55.898 --> 16:57.024
It isn't leave I want, sir.

17:00.528 --> 17:02.739
I wish to resign my commission.

17:08.367 --> 17:10.829
If I were you,
I'd think very carefully

17:10.913 --> 17:13.290
about what
you're saying, Lieutenant.

17:13.373 --> 17:15.792
I've made up my mind, sir.

17:15.876 --> 17:20.547
We'll talk about this when
you've spoken with your father.

17:20.631 --> 17:24.300
It isn't his decision, sir.

17:24.384 --> 17:27.554
I do not accept
these papers, Lieutenant

17:27.595 --> 17:29.889
and I do not accept
that one of my men

17:29.931 --> 17:31.182
would walk out
on his regiment...

17:31.266 --> 17:32.308
- Sir...
- ...the very week

17:32.434 --> 17:33.935
we are shipping off to war!

17:38.398 --> 17:42.651
Now, as far as I'm concerned,
you were never here.

17:42.735 --> 17:45.488
You can thank
your father for that.

17:47.531 --> 17:48.616
Sir...

17:53.079 --> 17:55.456
I wish to resign my commission.

18:00.085 --> 18:02.587
Please leave
these barracks immediately.

18:26.277 --> 18:27.987
Whoa!

18:31.657 --> 18:34.410
Hello, Miss Willoughby!

18:34.493 --> 18:38.664
I thought I could smell the
scent of fresh roses in the air.

18:38.747 --> 18:39.999
Harry's resigned.

18:40.082 --> 18:41.125
Resigned what?

18:41.166 --> 18:42.960
His bloody commission,
what do you think?

18:45.671 --> 18:48.757
What did Hamilton do?
Refuse him leave to marry Ethne?

18:48.840 --> 18:51.634
Hamilton didn't do anything.
There was no excuse for it.

18:51.718 --> 18:52.802
"Excuse for it"?

18:52.886 --> 18:54.029
You're talking about Harry.

18:54.032 --> 18:56.222
He's right, Tom.
He's just got engaged.

18:56.306 --> 18:58.016
It's perfectly natural
to have doubts.

18:58.099 --> 19:00.977
We're sent to war, and
the very next day he resigns?

19:01.019 --> 19:02.521
There's no doubt about it.

19:02.562 --> 19:03.814
What's that supposed to mean?

19:03.897 --> 19:04.980
I think it's perfectly clear
what it means.

19:05.022 --> 19:06.649
- Tom, don't be absurd.
- Shut up, Vicar.

19:06.732 --> 19:08.192
It means he's a coward, Jack.

19:13.364 --> 19:15.324
Then say that to his face.

19:15.449 --> 19:16.576
I would've done

19:16.659 --> 19:19.120
only he left the barracks
before I had a chance.

19:19.203 --> 19:21.496
All right, then,
say it to my face.

19:21.580 --> 19:22.748
Easy, Jack.

19:26.543 --> 19:27.836
Harry's a disgrace!

19:28.962 --> 19:31.089
He's disgraced the regiment!

19:31.173 --> 19:31.965
Jack!

19:32.049 --> 19:33.992
He's the best soldier
in the regiment!

19:33.995 --> 19:35.761
Obviously not when it counts.

19:38.305 --> 19:39.430
Get off!

19:40.431 --> 19:42.308
I will tell him

19:42.433 --> 19:44.561
but not to his face...
he doesn't deserve it.

19:44.644 --> 19:47.981
He deserves to be treated with the
same contempt that he treated us.

19:48.022 --> 19:48.982
What contempt?

19:49.023 --> 19:53.903
Did he talk to you about it?
Did he talk to any of you?

19:53.987 --> 19:55.113
He's left our backs exposed

19:55.196 --> 19:57.197
and he doesn't even have
the courage to tell us.

20:04.914 --> 20:06.582
He was my friend, too, Jack.

20:14.381 --> 20:16.216
He'll be there.

20:25.100 --> 20:26.685
This has to be answered.

20:46.912 --> 20:53.085
Do you, Harry Faversham take this
woman to be your lawful, wedded wife?

20:53.168 --> 20:55.671
Yes, and you may kiss the bride.

20:55.754 --> 20:59.382
You can't jump ahead like that. You
have to let me enjoy my wedding.

20:59.508 --> 21:03.678
It's your fault we won't be able to do
the real one for another six months.

21:03.761 --> 21:06.639
There's no reason why we can't get
married whenever we like, is there?

21:06.723 --> 21:07.682
I've heard that before.

21:07.766 --> 21:10.060
I've left the army.

21:12.103 --> 21:16.441
No, Ethne, I...
I have... left the army.

21:23.072 --> 21:24.031
Why?

21:28.452 --> 21:35.835
Well, there was talk they may
send us abroad for a year or two.

21:39.421 --> 21:42.132
I didn't want to wait that long
to get married.

21:42.174 --> 21:48.347
Well, I would've waited or come with you.

21:48.430 --> 21:50.724
My mother did the same
for my father.

21:50.808 --> 21:53.936
Yes, I know, but it isn't
what I wanted for us.

21:56.938 --> 21:59.857
You're all that matters
to me now.

22:02.485 --> 22:04.529
Where were they going
to send you?

22:09.200 --> 22:10.827
They weren't sure.

22:18.042 --> 22:19.877
Mr. Faversham.

23:10.426 --> 23:13.679
Is this your friends' idea
of a joke?

23:13.762 --> 23:15.723
What is it, Harry?

23:20.727 --> 23:22.645
Feathers of... of cowardice.

23:24.939 --> 23:30.320
Yesterday, we... were informed that
our regiment would be shipping out

23:30.403 --> 23:37.576
to the Sudan... that we would be... sent to war.

23:37.618 --> 23:42.415
You don't know where they were sending you
you said so yourself... and you did it for me.

23:42.498 --> 23:44.300
- Ethne...
- Nobody in their right minds

23:47.083 --> 23:47.111
could call you a coward,
especially not your friends.

23:47.114 --> 23:50.923
There's been some kind of misunderstanding.
You have to clear it up.

23:50.965 --> 23:53.500
You have to go back
to the regiment and clear it up.

23:53.500 --> 23:54.217
No, I can't.

23:54.301 --> 23:59.330
Then I will. I'll go see Trent,
Willoughby and Castleton myself

23:59.330 --> 24:02.893
and tell them it's my fault you
resignedthat you did it for me.

24:02.976 --> 24:05.771
It has nothing to do with you,
Ethne!

24:09.982 --> 24:11.943
Then why?

24:14.953 --> 24:18.491
I never wanted to join the army!

24:25.039 --> 24:27.499
I did it for my father.

24:28.541 --> 24:32.462
I thought I'd serve out
my commission in a year or two

24:32.545 --> 24:34.131
keep everyone happy,
and then I could just...

24:34.214 --> 24:37.259
You'd what, wait till we were
married to tell me the truth?

24:37.301 --> 24:40.429
No, Ethne, I never meant
to lie to you.

24:40.471 --> 24:43.765
No, but you were quite happy
to let me deceive myself.

24:43.848 --> 24:47.811
Do you think people
will let us forget this?

24:47.852 --> 24:51.314
I don't care
what people think, Ethne.

24:51.356 --> 24:53.483
All I care about is us.

24:55.527 --> 24:57.320
It's not about us, Harry.

24:57.446 --> 25:00.948
It's not just about us.

25:00.990 --> 25:03.784
What about Jack?
He would give his life for you.

25:03.868 --> 25:05.328
Don't you think I know that?

25:05.369 --> 25:09.165
Then go back. It's not too late.

25:09.207 --> 25:14.003
Tell them you wouldn't have
resigned if it weren't for me.

25:14.087 --> 25:25.180
I would... have resigned... and I wouldn't 
have gone to war for anything or anyone.

25:29.101 --> 25:32.313
Then you are a coward.

25:53.749 --> 25:55.508
Fight for England!

26:08.263 --> 26:11.558
"Avoid drinking local water
and spirits

26:11.600 --> 26:18.398
"avoid local barrooms and brothels and, above
all, remember, you're a Christian soldier."

26:18.482 --> 26:20.108
Why'd they give this to me?

26:20.192 --> 26:21.735
It must be for you, Vicar.

26:35.790 --> 26:37.166
Father?

26:42.005 --> 26:43.297
After you.

26:45.591 --> 26:46.800
May I speak with you, sir?

26:49.261 --> 26:50.846
I don't know you.

26:57.186 --> 26:59.229
I need to speak with you, sir.

27:23.127 --> 27:29.425
British attack the City of Korti!
British casualties in the Sudan!

28:11.131 --> 28:13.300
Something wrong, Jack?

28:26.104 --> 28:31.026
Well, I don't know about you lot but I'm
going to get a drink before Mustafa does.

28:34.279 --> 28:35.364
It's probably poisoned.

28:40.244 --> 28:43.120
Mustafa, after you, mate.

28:48.918 --> 28:51.212
- Take cover!
- Stay down!

28:51.296 --> 28:53.214
Take cover! Take cover!

28:53.298 --> 28:54.299
Where is he?

28:54.382 --> 28:55.508
Get down and stay down!

28:55.592 --> 28:56.926
- Get down!
- Take cover!

28:57.010 --> 28:57.719
Where is he?

28:57.760 --> 28:59.678
Where is he?

28:59.761 --> 29:00.888
Take cover!

29:00.971 --> 29:02.431
Stay down!
Stay down, everyone!

29:02.514 --> 29:06.685
Find him! Find him!
Where the bloody hell is he?

29:06.769 --> 29:07.728
He's on the roof!

29:07.811 --> 29:09.021
- Where?!
- Over there!

29:09.063 --> 29:10.397
Over there!

29:16.611 --> 29:17.695
Get him!

29:28.790 --> 29:30.083
Now!

29:33.252 --> 29:35.504
- Move!
- Right, sir.

30:07.327 --> 30:07.785
Hey!

30:11.289 --> 30:12.749
Put the gun down.

30:14.459 --> 30:16.419
Put the gun down.

30:24.635 --> 30:26.262
Put the gun down!

30:38.566 --> 30:40.567
Tell him to put the gun down!

30:45.363 --> 30:46.656
Put your gun down!

30:46.698 --> 30:52.079
For God sakes, man,
put your gun down!

30:59.502 --> 31:00.211
Don't.

31:04.173 --> 31:04.841
Hold your fire.

31:08.344 --> 31:09.262
Put the gun down.

31:10.763 --> 31:12.640
Tell him to put his gun down!

31:12.724 --> 31:13.932
Don't! Don't! Don't!

32:01.395 --> 32:03.147
What's done is done, Harry.

32:03.231 --> 32:03.898
No, sir

32:03.981 --> 32:05.524
it isn't.

32:05.565 --> 32:07.651
Something like this happens...

32:10.529 --> 32:12.489
...and you're lost.

32:14.533 --> 32:19.496
You don't know who you are
anymore or what you're capable of.

32:21.165 --> 32:24.292
Unless I do something...

32:24.375 --> 32:28.880
this is how people will
always remember me...

32:28.963 --> 32:30.590
a feather...

32:30.632 --> 32:35.595
and that is
how I will always see myself...

32:35.637 --> 32:37.597
a coward.

32:37.639 --> 32:42.351
All I know is I can't live
with myself like this.

32:44.979 --> 32:48.691
Who gave you the fourth feather?

32:50.443 --> 32:51.402
Jack Durrance?

32:53.863 --> 32:55.822
No, sir.

32:55.864 --> 32:57.824
Ethne did.

33:15.424 --> 33:16.884
Dearest Ethne:

33:16.968 --> 33:20.012
Forgive me for all the shame
I've caused you.

33:20.096 --> 33:24.684
I can only imagine the indignities you
must have suffered because of me.

33:35.652 --> 33:38.562
I hope my leaving London will
at least allow you

33:38.563 --> 33:42.326
to begin your life again,
free of my shadow.

33:42.409 --> 33:45.937
I have no right to your trust
or claim to your love

33:45.937 --> 33:48.957
but please believe,
I never set out to deceive you.

33:49.040 --> 33:56.419
I don't know if an opportunity will ever arise
to redeem myself but I have to believe it will

33:56.423 --> 34:00.552
and I have to believe that this
time I'll face up to my fears

34:00.635 --> 34:05.289
and prove to myself and others,
I'm not a coward.

34:05.292 --> 34:09.518
- What did he pay you to bring him here?
- Listen, Gustave, I wouldn't bring...

34:09.560 --> 34:11.520
Take this.

34:11.562 --> 34:14.315
Now get out.

34:14.398 --> 34:16.025
Don't come back.

34:19.779 --> 34:21.279
What do you want?

34:21.362 --> 34:24.658
Can you take me
to the British camp at Korti?

34:24.699 --> 34:26.994
Across the desert?

34:27.077 --> 34:29.161
Yes.

34:29.246 --> 34:30.289
Why?

34:36.545 --> 34:38.504
Can you take me there or not?

34:44.385 --> 34:46.346
For your time.

34:49.516 --> 34:51.184
Can you speak Arabic?

34:51.266 --> 34:52.893
I can learn.

34:52.936 --> 34:54.853
Yes, but can you learn
to look like an Arab?

34:54.937 --> 34:57.606
If the Mahdi's men find you...

34:57.690 --> 35:01.374
I'm taking a caravan of whores
up to Korti next week.

35:01.377 --> 35:03.696
Come and see me then.

35:03.779 --> 35:07.908
Left, right, left, right,
left, right, left.

35:07.992 --> 35:09.076
Thank you.

35:09.160 --> 35:12.078
Left, right, left, right,
left, right, left.

35:12.162 --> 35:13.580
Congratulations, Jack.

35:13.663 --> 35:15.582
I've decided
to give you a few weeks' leave.

35:15.624 --> 35:19.211
Every report I receive
singles you out for praise.

35:21.097 --> 35:26.093
You and several other officers will be
going to Londonto convince Parliament

35:26.134 --> 35:28.760
and the public opinion
that it's high time

35:28.760 --> 35:32.598
this government ordered us out of
Korti to rescue General Gordon.

35:32.682 --> 35:35.101
With your permission, I'd rather
stay here with the regiment.

35:35.142 --> 35:36.144
Why?

35:36.185 --> 35:37.979
I don't feel
I've done my duty yet.

35:38.062 --> 35:40.106
I wouldn't want
to let the others down.

35:40.148 --> 35:42.900
Permission refused.

35:42.984 --> 35:45.277
Sir, why me?

35:45.360 --> 35:47.613
Because you're a hero, Jack.

35:47.696 --> 35:49.656
With all due respect, sir

35:49.698 --> 35:54.870
I don't think we've been fighting long enough
to have any heroes in this campaign.

36:12.846 --> 36:14.431
Shut up!

36:14.514 --> 36:17.976
Keep them quiet, Saadi!
What do I pay you for?!

36:31.197 --> 36:33.366
They are princesses.

36:33.449 --> 36:36.535
Can you imagine even the
savages have royalty?

36:36.618 --> 36:39.871
But the British soldiers pay me
three dirham an hour for them.

36:39.955 --> 36:41.957
Well worth the trip to Korti.

36:42.040 --> 36:45.627
Is this the Mahdi's territory?

36:45.711 --> 36:48.505
Everywhere is Mahdi territory.

37:16.865 --> 37:18.867
- Mm.
- Mm.

37:21.412 --> 37:23.205
What is it?

37:23.289 --> 37:24.540
She doesn't like my manners?

37:39.721 --> 37:41.056
Savage!

37:42.015 --> 37:42.766
Stop it!

37:42.849 --> 37:45.851
You're not to look at me!

37:45.893 --> 37:48.187
Stop!

37:48.271 --> 37:49.563
Stop doing this!

37:49.605 --> 37:52.149
Stop it! Stop it!

37:52.233 --> 37:53.651
Stop it!

37:53.734 --> 37:55.361
I'll teach you manners!

37:55.445 --> 37:57.739
Stop it! Enough!

37:58.865 --> 37:59.907
That'll teach you manners!

38:00.949 --> 38:02.784
Enough!

38:12.461 --> 38:16.090
You think she'll thank you
for what you did today?

38:16.131 --> 38:18.508
I don't expect her to. 

38:18.591 --> 38:20.927
Of course you do;
you saved her life.

38:20.969 --> 38:23.471
Tsk, tsk! Tsk!

38:35.232 --> 38:36.817
They're like children.

38:36.901 --> 38:40.404
They have no concept
of gratitude or loyalty.

38:40.488 --> 38:44.617
That's something you British
don't understand.

38:44.700 --> 38:52.040
You come here, trying to civilize
them with your Christian values.

39:07.306 --> 39:10.850
Now, she'll thank you.

39:17.857 --> 39:20.234
Don't be so proud, my friend.

41:24.953 --> 41:28.215
There are followers of the Mahdi
everywhere in the Sudan.

41:28.215 --> 41:33.780
The rebel tribes are gathering forces under
the leadership of the Mahdi to fight us.

41:33.863 --> 41:36.032
We do not need
more reinforcements.

41:36.115 --> 41:39.911
All we need is for this government
to give an order to march

41:39.994 --> 41:44.957
and we will route the enemy and
preserve the dignity of our empire.

41:51.547 --> 41:53.424
Have you heard from Harry?

41:53.465 --> 41:54.633
No.

41:56.760 --> 41:58.303
Have you?

41:58.428 --> 42:00.555
No.

42:00.638 --> 42:04.601
Ethne, you can't blame yourself.

42:04.642 --> 42:08.313
You make a stupid mistake and you
pay for it for the rest of your life.

42:08.396 --> 42:11.691
I can't forgive myself.

42:11.775 --> 42:13.235
You had your reasons.

42:13.318 --> 42:15.611
What reasons?

42:15.653 --> 42:16.904
Pride?

42:16.987 --> 42:21.659
Because I was afraid
of what people would say.

42:21.742 --> 42:25.663
What do I care what people said?

42:25.705 --> 42:26.998
I loved him.

42:27.081 --> 42:29.041
Ethne, you have to...

42:29.083 --> 42:30.960
He came to me, Jack.

42:33.003 --> 42:35.255
He came to me
and I turned him away.

42:35.338 --> 42:37.466
It's all right.

42:37.549 --> 42:42.262
It won't be like this
for the rest of your life.

42:43.889 --> 42:46.683
I'll write to you when I'm gone.

44:10.347 --> 44:13.725
Left, right, left, right,
left, right, left.

44:13.766 --> 44:17.979
Left, right, left,
right, left, right, left.

44:18.062 --> 44:22.442
Left, right, left, right,
left, right, left, right

44:22.525 --> 44:24.486
left, right, stop!

45:22.541 --> 45:24.043
Referee, come on!

45:24.126 --> 45:25.169
That wasn't fair!

45:33.093 --> 45:34.637
Congratulations!

45:59.118 --> 46:00.036
Open up.

46:00.119 --> 46:01.704
He's got no teeth.
Get rid of him.

46:01.787 --> 46:03.706
Who's next?!

46:03.789 --> 46:05.291
Come on, keep 'em coming,
keep 'em coming.

46:05.374 --> 46:07.794
No, he's too small.

46:10.213 --> 46:12.506
I want to see
this man's teeth.

46:14.299 --> 46:15.384
He looks strong enough.

46:15.467 --> 46:17.886
Put him
with the baggage porters.

46:17.970 --> 46:19.596
How many more we got?
How many, Bill?

46:19.680 --> 46:22.683
Okay, we need
another three of them.

46:24.893 --> 46:26.812
What's going on?!

46:26.895 --> 46:30.940
This man comes from a tribe of slaves.
The men will not serve with him, sir.

46:31.024 --> 46:33.443
Look, we need all the help
we can get.

46:33.526 --> 46:34.944
Baggage porter!

46:35.028 --> 46:37.781
Get him through.

46:37.864 --> 46:39.282
I can't believe it.

46:39.407 --> 46:41.409
Come on. Come on.
Get him through.

46:41.493 --> 46:42.953
Come on, next.

46:43.536 --> 46:45.497
My Dearest Jack:

46:45.580 --> 46:48.624
I was so relieved
to receive your last letter.

46:48.707 --> 46:53.087
While the whole country is celebrating
your campaign against the Mahdi

46:53.129 --> 46:55.715
all I feel is dread.

46:55.798 --> 47:00.261
And all I think about are the precious
times we spent together: you, Harry, and I.

47:00.428 --> 47:05.223
My father used to say that God takes
away what's dearest to our hearts

47:05.307 --> 47:08.143
to remind us
how much we take for granted.

47:08.226 --> 47:11.938
Now that it's too late,
I wish I could turn back time.

47:11.980 --> 47:15.442
How differently I'd do things
given a second chance.

47:15.525 --> 47:17.653
Take good care of yourself,
Jack.

47:17.736 --> 47:21.239
I don't mind if you don't
come back covered in glory.

47:21.364 --> 47:23.616
Just come back safely.

47:23.658 --> 47:26.494
Your friend forever, Ethne.

47:37.921 --> 47:42.259
Thoughtful of General Wolseley to
give us these umbrellas, eh, Vicar?

47:42.301 --> 47:44.303
I burn in the sun.

48:06.324 --> 48:07.617
Come on, now, faster!

48:07.659 --> 48:08.743
Faster!

48:19.003 --> 48:19.962
Watch out!

49:29.738 --> 49:32.074
Abou Fatma.

49:35.327 --> 49:38.663
My name is Abou Fatma.

49:38.746 --> 49:39.831
Vedu.

49:39.914 --> 49:44.168
I was a scout for General Hicks.

49:47.422 --> 49:50.717
There are many in this camp
who serve the Mahdi.

49:50.758 --> 49:54.511
When they find out there's
a British spy amongst them

49:54.595 --> 49:57.431
watching them, they'll kill him.

49:57.473 --> 50:00.768
It won't be long, Vedu.

50:11.736 --> 50:13.196
Why would you warn me?

50:18.660 --> 50:19.703
For money.

50:19.786 --> 50:20.954
I can't pay you.

50:23.456 --> 50:25.250
What's the feather for?

50:31.547 --> 50:33.299
First time I killed a man.

50:38.012 --> 50:39.680
Five men.

50:39.764 --> 50:42.433
Wait.

50:46.520 --> 50:49.064
Ten men.

50:49.147 --> 50:50.274
This...

50:50.357 --> 50:53.277
I will wear soon.

50:55.988 --> 51:00.283
I'm a good soldier.

51:00.324 --> 51:02.118
I... will protect you.

51:18.884 --> 51:22.263
Who did this?! Who did this?!

51:23.472 --> 51:25.516
Who did this?!

51:32.148 --> 51:35.525
Who did this?!

52:02.260 --> 52:04.637
Keep your eyes to the front.

52:10.642 --> 52:13.979
Why would a British spy
be hiding from his own soldiers?

52:14.062 --> 52:15.856
I'm not a spy.

53:13.620 --> 53:16.706
Is that the same letter
you read over and over again

53:16.789 --> 53:19.500
or do you get a different one
each day?

53:21.461 --> 53:23.796
He writes them to himself.

53:25.381 --> 53:26.841
Read us a line.

53:26.925 --> 53:28.510
Read your own.

53:28.593 --> 53:29.719
Don't be so coy.

53:29.803 --> 53:31.429
You're amongst friends.

53:32.680 --> 53:34.765
Come on, Jack, you can trust us.

53:42.940 --> 53:46.569
"I'm so glad I came to hear you
speak that day in London."

53:49.613 --> 53:51.239
Come on, more than that.

53:51.323 --> 53:53.742
Don't leave us hanging on...
elaborate.

54:00.290 --> 54:05.295
"It made me realize how much
your friendship means to me.

54:05.337 --> 54:11.718
"Come back safely and soon...

54:12.301 --> 54:14.011
my dearest Jack."

54:17.056 --> 54:19.142
Ooh!

54:19.225 --> 54:21.352
Well, well done,
"my dearest Jack"!

54:21.394 --> 54:22.812
Who's the lucky lady?

54:22.895 --> 54:24.771
Ethne.

54:28.275 --> 54:29.818
I'm going to ask her
to marry me.

54:46.668 --> 54:48.044
Congratulations, Jack.

54:48.086 --> 54:49.087
That's fantastic, Jack.

54:49.170 --> 54:50.755
She hasn't said yes.

54:50.839 --> 54:52.966
Aah, she will.

54:53.049 --> 54:55.760
"I realize how much
I bloody love you."

54:55.760 --> 54:57.554
"How much your friendship
means to me."

54:57.595 --> 54:58.888
Same thing.

54:58.929 --> 55:01.557
Cheers, Jack.

55:05.895 --> 55:07.229
Congratulations, Jack.

55:30.502 --> 55:32.628
They look like the Mahdi's men.

55:32.712 --> 55:35.006
I need to find out
where he's going.

55:37.091 --> 55:38.718
Deserters, sir.

55:50.479 --> 55:52.272
Corporal, cease fire!

55:58.320 --> 56:00.072
Harry.

56:09.414 --> 56:12.500
Looks like they've stopped
for the night.

56:18.215 --> 56:20.967
Why is it so important
to follow them?

56:21.051 --> 56:23.678
The Mahdi spies will report
on our troop movements.

56:23.761 --> 56:24.929
Not the spies...

56:27.014 --> 56:28.641
...your friends.

56:33.020 --> 56:36.816
To help them... if I can.

56:42.237 --> 56:44.740
Are you a deserter?

56:50.996 --> 56:52.831
Something like that.

56:58.127 --> 57:00.797
I was sent to fight,
and I ran away.

57:04.509 --> 57:05.885
Why?

57:07.679 --> 57:09.305
Why?

57:11.850 --> 57:14.435
Well...

57:14.518 --> 57:16.395
I just...

57:18.939 --> 57:21.400
There are many reasons why.

57:27.615 --> 57:29.575
Mostly, I was afraid.

57:47.175 --> 57:56.309
I found you half dead crossing the
desert alone. You say you are afraid?

58:04.316 --> 58:06.401
It's a different kind of fear.

58:15.953 --> 58:18.247
Why are you protecting me?

58:21.207 --> 58:23.084
God put you in my way.

58:23.126 --> 58:25.378
I have no choice.

58:25.462 --> 58:27.255
God?

58:32.427 --> 58:34.387
Hmm.

58:34.429 --> 58:38.557
An Englishman and a Christian.

58:41.477 --> 58:44.830
You must've done something
terrible to offend him.

58:53.948 --> 58:55.949
You laugh like an Englishman.

59:00.287 --> 59:01.788
And how does
an Englishman laugh?

59:26.980 --> 59:28.773
Abou...

59:28.856 --> 59:30.816
they're leaving!

59:33.152 --> 59:34.195
They're getting away.

59:35.696 --> 59:37.198
We can't lose them.

59:46.039 --> 59:48.208
All right, I'll...

59:48.291 --> 59:50.919
I'll just sit here
and wait for you.

59:52.629 --> 59:54.506
Take your time.

59:58.051 --> 59:59.386
Oh.

01:00:27.413 --> 01:00:29.832
That is the fortress
of Abou Clea.

01:00:29.873 --> 01:00:33.252
The British reinforcements
are stationed there.

01:00:33.377 --> 01:00:36.796
Why would the spies be going
to a British fort?

01:01:53.091 --> 01:01:57.080
The fort has been taken over
by the Mahdi's army.

01:01:58.983 --> 01:02:01.133
But this is where
our troops are heading.

01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:28.585
Abou!

01:02:32.338 --> 01:02:34.548
Abou, warn my friends.

01:03:50.562 --> 01:03:52.564
Company, halt!

01:03:52.648 --> 01:03:57.444
- Company, halt!
- Company, halt!

01:04:34.232 --> 01:04:35.899
Mr. Trench!

01:04:35.942 --> 01:04:37.193
William!

01:04:37.235 --> 01:04:38.862
Get away from them!

01:04:38.903 --> 01:04:39.654
Leave them alone!

01:04:39.738 --> 01:04:40.739
You filthy...

01:04:40.822 --> 01:04:41.781
Sir?

01:04:41.823 --> 01:04:44.116
You leave
these bloody men alone!

01:04:45.451 --> 01:04:46.827
Come back here!

01:04:50.331 --> 01:04:52.583
Go on!

01:05:10.141 --> 01:05:12.768
Oh...

01:05:24.446 --> 01:05:28.825
Sir. The Egyptians have captured
an enemy scout.

01:05:35.414 --> 01:05:36.558
Where did you find this man?

01:05:36.558 --> 01:05:38.100
I came to you myself.

01:05:38.183 --> 01:05:41.420
The Mahdi's men have captured
your fort at Abou Clea.

01:05:41.462 --> 01:05:43.171
This man is lying, sir.

01:05:43.255 --> 01:05:45.800
He's the one who stole the camels
They will attack you here!

01:05:50.597 --> 01:05:54.558
Tell him a British garrison would
never fall to the Mahdi savages!

01:05:56.602 --> 01:05:59.129
Ask him if he knows the penalty
for being a spy.

01:05:59.129 --> 01:06:01.022
I'm not a spy.

01:06:01.048 --> 01:06:03.984
The Mahdi's men have left
these bodies to keep you here.

01:06:03.985 --> 01:06:07.613
Tell him I'll bury him alive if he
speaks another word of English!

01:06:08.196 --> 01:06:10.281
Ask him who sent him here
and why.

01:06:20.208 --> 01:06:22.635
He says a British officer
sent him, sir.

01:06:22.635 --> 01:06:25.338
A general, no doubt.
What was his name?

01:06:33.846 --> 01:06:34.764
Come here, son.

01:06:34.847 --> 01:06:39.527
I'll show you a British officer.
This is a British officer!

01:06:39.527 --> 01:06:45.290
And this... is a British officer's blood.
Now lick it up... every bloody drop!

01:06:50.779 --> 01:06:52.989
Look! Don't be rash!

01:06:52.994 --> 01:06:53.865
Take him away.

01:06:53.907 --> 01:06:56.834
Find out why the enemy sent him.
Use any means necessary.

01:06:56.834 --> 01:07:00.872
The Muslims always bury
their dead, even the enemy dead.

01:07:00.874 --> 01:07:03.916
These bodies have been
left here for a reason!

01:07:05.043 --> 01:07:06.544
Come on, you!

01:07:09.547 --> 01:07:12.050
Look, I think
you should tell Hamilton.

01:07:12.133 --> 01:07:13.051
I agree, Tom.

01:07:13.134 --> 01:07:14.886
What for?

01:07:19.556 --> 01:07:21.558
As a precaution, Tom.

01:07:23.201 --> 01:07:25.395
This man was trying
to mislead us.

01:07:27.539 --> 01:07:29.483
I've made my decision.

01:07:29.567 --> 01:07:31.152
I'm not going to waste
the colonel's time

01:07:31.152 --> 01:07:35.196
by sending some half-naked savage
in front of him with a tall tale.

01:08:03.574 --> 01:08:07.687
- What is it, Jack?
- There's something up.

01:08:07.687 --> 01:08:15.694
Thou God, who reigneth over all the earth
who art the Lord of all our salvation

01:08:15.736 --> 01:08:18.363
give your ear unto my prayer.

01:08:18.446 --> 01:08:22.743
Allah!

01:08:22.785 --> 01:08:25.703
For Thou art greater
than the common man.

01:08:25.745 --> 01:08:27.956
Everything is as you wish it.

01:08:28.038 --> 01:08:29.982
Everything is as you will it.

01:08:29.986 --> 01:08:37.523
If what we're doing is just then
give us the strength to serve you

01:08:37.527 --> 01:08:40.990
for that which I greatly feared
has come upon me...

01:08:42.928 --> 01:08:47.224
...and that which I was
afraid of is come unto me.

01:08:54.564 --> 01:08:55.941
Form a line.

01:08:55.948 --> 01:08:58.444
First company...
a section, if you please.

01:09:03.782 --> 01:09:06.618
One section will fix bayonets.

01:09:06.702 --> 01:09:07.911
Fix!

01:09:12.207 --> 01:09:14.251
Ready!

01:09:14.334 --> 01:09:15.919
Present!

01:09:19.505 --> 01:09:20.924
- Fire.
- Fire.

01:09:20.965 --> 01:09:22.091
Fire!

01:09:22.133 --> 01:09:23.468
Reload!

01:09:26.763 --> 01:09:27.764
100 yards!

01:09:27.846 --> 01:09:29.933
Present!

01:09:29.974 --> 01:09:31.309
They're not armed, sir.

01:09:31.393 --> 01:09:32.769
- Fire.
- Fire.

01:09:32.810 --> 01:09:33.395
Fire!

01:09:39.330 --> 01:09:41.490
What in God's name
are they doing?

01:09:44.919 --> 01:09:47.005
Present!

01:09:49.341 --> 01:09:50.258
- Fire.
- Fire.

01:09:50.341 --> 01:09:52.260
Fire!

01:09:56.764 --> 01:09:57.890
50 yards!

01:09:59.308 --> 01:10:00.684
Present!

01:10:05.690 --> 01:10:07.942
- Fire.
- Fire.

01:10:08.025 --> 01:10:09.235
Fire!

01:10:20.412 --> 01:10:22.289
Thank you, Mr. Willoughby.

01:10:22.331 --> 01:10:23.790
Thank you, Sergeant.

01:10:23.874 --> 01:10:26.251
Order... up!

01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:30.880
Soldier... arm!

01:10:30.963 --> 01:10:34.384
Left turn.

01:10:34.467 --> 01:10:37.303
Left, right, left!

01:11:10.752 --> 01:11:13.672
- Form square!
- Form square!

01:11:43.116 --> 01:11:45.285
Form square!

01:11:45.327 --> 01:11:48.330
Bring over those camels!
Line them up!

01:11:48.414 --> 01:11:50.624
Quickly now, take positions!

01:11:55.420 --> 01:11:57.380
Number Three Section, fall in!

01:12:04.888 --> 01:12:05.847
Steady.

01:12:05.889 --> 01:12:08.058
Steady, boys, steady!

01:12:08.141 --> 01:12:10.434
Be calm.

01:12:12.311 --> 01:12:14.522
Nice and calm.

01:12:21.946 --> 01:12:23.614
Be nice and calm.

01:12:26.408 --> 01:12:28.034
Battalion prepare the cavalry,
Mr. Willoughby.

01:12:28.076 --> 01:12:29.119
Battalion, prepare the cavalry.

01:12:29.244 --> 01:12:31.413
Make way for the cavalry!

01:12:34.207 --> 01:12:36.543
Number One Company,
prepare for volley.

01:12:36.585 --> 01:12:38.587
Number One Company,
two rounds volley fire!

01:12:38.629 --> 01:12:41.965
Number One Company...

01:12:42.049 --> 01:12:44.967
two rounds volley fire!

01:12:48.888 --> 01:12:50.890
Steady on the right,
Mr. Castleton!

01:12:55.603 --> 01:12:56.688
Pick your targets!

01:13:13.329 --> 01:13:14.163
Fire!

01:13:17.707 --> 01:13:18.416
Fire!

01:13:19.667 --> 01:13:20.835
Fire!

01:13:42.007 --> 01:13:45.594
Sir, we're being attacked
from behind, sir!

01:13:47.389 --> 01:13:49.599
Close in on the right,
Castleton!

01:13:52.310 --> 01:13:55.271
Officers to the front!

01:13:55.313 --> 01:13:57.273
Present...

01:13:57.357 --> 01:13:58.566
aim...

01:13:58.650 --> 01:14:00.443
Castleton!

01:14:00.527 --> 01:14:01.069
...fire!

01:14:04.823 --> 01:14:05.823
Fire!

01:14:19.824 --> 01:14:21.784
Keep your horses a target!

01:14:21.868 --> 01:14:23.411
Hold this line!

01:14:37.049 --> 01:14:39.677
The British Cavalry, sir!

01:14:42.263 --> 01:14:43.930
They're retreating!

01:14:45.974 --> 01:14:47.684
They're running!

01:14:48.685 --> 01:14:55.859
All right, men, cease fire!
Cease fire! Cease fire!

01:14:55.901 --> 01:14:56.902
Congratulations, sir.

01:14:56.943 --> 01:14:58.028
Battle's not over yet.

01:14:58.069 --> 01:14:59.738
Yes!

01:14:59.821 --> 01:15:02.222
We sod 'em off, lads!

01:15:02.222 --> 01:15:03.991
Send out the skirmishers,
Mr. Willoughby.

01:15:04.075 --> 01:15:07.286
- Send out the skirmishers!
- Well done, Four Section!

01:15:07.286 --> 01:15:09.830
Vicar! Come on, Vicar!

01:15:09.872 --> 01:15:11.082
Vicar, come on!

01:15:27.556 --> 01:15:30.058
- Close the square!
- Close the square!

01:15:36.981 --> 01:15:38.232
Charge!

01:16:21.558 --> 01:16:24.310
Deliver me from
blood guiltiness, O God.

01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:10.109
It's not the British!
It's the Mahdi!

01:17:15.948 --> 01:17:17.991
Get back!

01:17:41.264 --> 01:17:43.767
Volley fire, if you please,
Mr. Willoughby!

01:17:43.850 --> 01:17:45.769
The skirmishers, sir?

01:17:45.852 --> 01:17:47.686
Hold this square at all costs

01:17:47.770 --> 01:17:48.604
Mr. Willoughby!

01:17:50.814 --> 01:17:53.526
Get back to the square!
Get back to the square!

01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:59.198
Get back to the square! Go!

01:17:59.281 --> 01:18:03.618
Get back to the square! Go! Go!

01:18:03.702 --> 01:18:05.120
Vicar!

01:18:05.203 --> 01:18:07.330
...my sins deliver before me!

01:18:07.372 --> 01:18:09.374
Volley fire, Mr. Willoughby!

01:18:09.458 --> 01:18:10.834
Now!

01:18:15.756 --> 01:18:18.342
Mr. Willoughby,
I gave you a direct order!

01:18:19.468 --> 01:18:21.010
Castleton!

01:18:28.685 --> 01:18:30.812
Save me from my sins!

01:18:33.231 --> 01:18:36.484
Vicar,
get back to the four square!

01:18:56.044 --> 01:18:57.921
- Go on, Trench! Go on!
- Run!

01:18:59.798 --> 01:19:00.674
Present!

01:19:05.178 --> 01:19:06.555
Fire!

01:19:11.100 --> 01:19:12.685
Don't shoot!

01:19:14.937 --> 01:19:16.564
Come on! Let's go!

01:19:19.984 --> 01:19:21.527
Vicar!

01:19:36.471 --> 01:19:38.139
Close the square!

01:19:38.181 --> 01:19:39.850
Mr. Willoughby...

01:19:57.658 --> 01:20:00.828
Jack!

01:20:04.165 --> 01:20:07.543
What are your orders, sir?

01:20:07.584 --> 01:20:08.377
Sir!

01:20:10.087 --> 01:20:11.713
Sound the retreat!

01:22:30.987 --> 01:22:32.838
"My dear Jack..."

01:23:05.231 --> 01:23:06.982
Oh...

01:23:27.424 --> 01:23:29.093
I'm a fool.

01:23:38.811 --> 01:23:43.815
I was a fool to think
that I could ever go back home.

01:23:46.192 --> 01:23:47.485
I can't.

01:23:59.205 --> 01:24:01.874
Your friend needs help.

01:24:01.999 --> 01:24:05.127
My friend knows
how to help himself.

01:24:05.169 --> 01:24:07.630
I can't see.

01:24:15.762 --> 01:24:17.639
I can't see.

01:24:35.139 --> 01:24:38.493
I can't see!

01:24:44.416 --> 01:24:45.333
Oh! Don't!

01:24:46.209 --> 01:24:48.627
Don't! Don't! Don't!

01:24:50.254 --> 01:24:51.213
Who are you?

01:24:51.297 --> 01:24:53.716
I have letters.

01:25:12.734 --> 01:25:13.568
Oh...

01:25:23.202 --> 01:25:24.579
Who are you?

01:25:31.127 --> 01:25:35.089
I can't see. I can't see.

01:25:35.131 --> 01:25:36.049
Shh.

01:25:38.717 --> 01:25:39.843
I can't see.

01:25:39.927 --> 01:25:40.886
Shh.

01:25:44.556 --> 01:25:49.270
Shh. Shh...

01:26:31.143 --> 01:26:33.061
Hello, Jack.

01:26:33.145 --> 01:26:35.564
Ethne.

01:26:46.950 --> 01:26:48.785
How are you?

01:27:01.631 --> 01:27:04.466
I wanted to ask your advice,
General.

01:27:04.508 --> 01:27:07.136
My advice?

01:27:07.219 --> 01:27:09.555
Jack Durrance has...

01:27:09.638 --> 01:27:11.182
has asked me to marry him.

01:27:14.101 --> 01:27:15.519
You don't need my advice.

01:27:15.603 --> 01:27:18.856
Jack Durrance is a good man.

01:27:22.943 --> 01:27:25.237
I haven't answered him yet.

01:27:32.494 --> 01:27:35.622
I was wondering
if you'd heard from Harry.

01:27:37.623 --> 01:27:42.545
I've heard nothing and, uh...

01:27:42.628 --> 01:27:45.506
I don't think
I shall hear from him again.

01:27:49.594 --> 01:27:52.847
I should've listened.

01:27:55.516 --> 01:27:57.684
I miss him.

01:27:57.768 --> 01:28:02.815
My son loved Jack Durrance
like a brother.

01:28:02.898 --> 01:28:06.527
I know he'd want you
to be happy.

01:28:09.572 --> 01:28:13.366
A few more weeks and he'll
be able to ride without help.

01:28:13.450 --> 01:28:15.493
Will that be the end
of your penance?

01:28:28.756 --> 01:28:30.007
Jack.

01:28:30.091 --> 01:28:31.801
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

01:28:31.884 --> 01:28:33.260
Not bad.

01:28:33.344 --> 01:28:34.971
You should see me on a camel.

01:28:40.393 --> 01:28:42.061
Lavender...

01:28:42.103 --> 01:28:43.563
and onions.

01:28:43.646 --> 01:28:45.564
Sunday lunch.

01:28:45.605 --> 01:28:49.401
Take the horse to the stables
and you can have some.

01:29:06.125 --> 01:29:08.378
Thank you, Robert,
it's quite all right.

01:29:10.088 --> 01:29:11.422
It's me, Jack.

01:29:14.968 --> 01:29:16.261
Tom.

01:29:36.446 --> 01:29:39.741
They finally made you
captain, Miss Willoughby.

01:29:39.824 --> 01:29:41.551
All those decorations.

01:29:44.996 --> 01:29:46.206
You must have a few, yourself.

01:29:46.289 --> 01:29:49.126
How'd you know
I was visiting today?

01:29:49.167 --> 01:29:50.752
l, uh...

01:29:56.132 --> 01:29:58.009
I saw Harry, Jack.

01:30:04.098 --> 01:30:06.476
Where?

01:30:06.517 --> 01:30:09.145
In the Sudan.

01:30:12.523 --> 01:30:15.651
I was following our retreat.

01:30:15.734 --> 01:30:19.213
We had a terrible time of it. The
enemy hounded us all the way.

01:30:19.217 --> 01:30:22.324
The desert itself
seemed to side with them.

01:30:22.366 --> 01:30:24.785
We ran out of water,
medical supplies...

01:30:24.869 --> 01:30:27.078
even had
to leave stragglers behind.

01:30:27.162 --> 01:30:29.873
Finally, our own native scouts
turned on us.

01:30:29.956 --> 01:30:34.294
We lost more men on that retreat
than we did at the battle.

01:30:39.299 --> 01:30:41.259
Get out!

01:30:43.636 --> 01:30:48.847
Didn't you hear what I said? I said get out
or I'll have you whipped you filthy wog!

01:30:48.849 --> 01:30:50.684
Like you had my friend whipped?

01:30:57.733 --> 01:30:59.152
Harry?

01:31:01.111 --> 01:31:02.904
I sent a man to warn you

01:31:02.988 --> 01:31:06.700
and you had him tortured
for his pains.

01:31:09.328 --> 01:31:11.496
I...

01:31:13.499 --> 01:31:15.501
What would it have cost
to listen?

01:31:15.584 --> 01:31:16.835
I didn't know it was you.

01:31:16.877 --> 01:31:19.003
You should've taken precautions,
Tom.

01:31:19.045 --> 01:31:20.254
I didn't know it was you.

01:31:24.217 --> 01:31:26.052
For God's sake,
what are you doing here?

01:31:43.194 --> 01:31:45.029
And afterwards?

01:31:45.612 --> 01:31:50.076
He, uh... he asked me
for some money and left.

01:31:50.159 --> 01:31:51.743
To come back?

01:31:51.785 --> 01:31:53.578
No.

01:31:53.620 --> 01:31:57.190
No, there was a...
there was a rumor going around

01:31:57.190 --> 01:32:00.293
that some of our surviving soldiers had
been captured and taken to prison.

01:32:00.377 --> 01:32:03.130
Harry thought Trench might be
one of them.

01:32:03.213 --> 01:32:04.715
He went after him?

01:32:04.798 --> 01:32:06.258
I tried to stop him, Jack.

01:32:06.741 --> 01:32:12.054
I told him they were only rumors that the
chances of survival were... virtually none.

01:32:12.596 --> 01:32:14.599
He wouldn't listen.

01:32:15.040 --> 01:32:19.562
Did you come here
to tell Ethne Harry was dead?

01:32:19.604 --> 01:32:21.564
I don't know that he's dead,
Jack.

01:32:21.606 --> 01:32:23.566
So you've come to give her hope?

01:32:25.109 --> 01:32:27.069
What would you do in my place?

01:32:27.152 --> 01:32:32.491
Keep it to myself, Tom,
until I was sure.

01:32:50.842 --> 01:32:52.510
What did he say?

01:32:52.594 --> 01:32:54.304
Your friend is dead.

01:32:54.387 --> 01:32:56.640
I saw Trench taken alive.

01:32:56.681 --> 01:32:59.767
Prisoners were taken
to Omdurman last month.

01:32:59.850 --> 01:33:01.519
Your army abandoned them.

01:33:01.602 --> 01:33:03.604
The shame is no longer yours.

01:33:03.687 --> 01:33:06.315
You're responsible
to yourself and to God

01:33:06.399 --> 01:33:08.109
not to them.

01:33:09.568 --> 01:33:11.487
I am responsible to my friend.

01:33:11.529 --> 01:33:13.197
I will find him.

01:33:13.281 --> 01:33:14.657
You have learned nothing.

01:33:14.699 --> 01:33:15.783
You've done enough.

01:33:15.867 --> 01:33:17.200
It's never enough, Abou.

01:33:17.242 --> 01:33:21.121
Look, if the Mahdi's men find out I'm
British they'll take me to their prison.

01:33:21.204 --> 01:33:23.123
It's the only way
I'll find my friend.

01:33:23.206 --> 01:33:24.541
They will hang you.

01:33:24.625 --> 01:33:26.835
Abou, you must help me get
into the prison.

01:33:26.919 --> 01:33:29.296
I will not be responsible
for your death.

01:33:31.632 --> 01:33:34.867
How could you be responsible
for my death?

01:33:38.346 --> 01:33:40.848
I will die if it is God's will.

01:33:41.766 --> 01:33:44.811
Yes?

01:33:46.980 --> 01:33:50.149
You English walk
too proudly on the earth.

01:33:57.406 --> 01:33:59.658
You are a fool...

01:34:02.286 --> 01:34:03.871
...my friend.

01:34:37.028 --> 01:34:38.780
Trench!

01:34:40.239 --> 01:34:41.239
Trench!

01:34:43.408 --> 01:34:44.451
Trench!

01:34:51.708 --> 01:34:52.751
Trench!

01:35:11.269 --> 01:35:12.437
Ibrahim!

01:35:12.520 --> 01:35:13.772
Trench!

01:35:13.813 --> 01:35:15.231
Don't lose our space!

01:35:17.483 --> 01:35:18.400
Come on, son.

01:35:18.484 --> 01:35:19.943
You mustn't fall.

01:35:20.903 --> 01:35:22.947
You mustn't fall.

01:35:26.909 --> 01:35:28.577
All right...

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:38.920
T-Trench.

01:35:39.004 --> 01:35:41.632
Harry?

01:35:51.432 --> 01:35:52.975
Harry...

01:35:53.017 --> 01:35:56.937
if you didn't come with
the army, then who sent you?

01:35:58.856 --> 01:36:00.691
You did.

01:36:16.123 --> 01:36:20.503
All this way... for a feather.

01:36:20.544 --> 01:36:22.630
I brought some money.

01:36:26.966 --> 01:36:28.635
How much?

01:36:28.677 --> 01:36:30.178
A hundred.

01:36:33.890 --> 01:36:36.143
Hundred?

01:36:46.401 --> 01:36:49.154
What's going on?
Who are those women?

01:36:49.739 --> 01:36:52.283
They're all relatives
of the men in here.

01:36:52.366 --> 01:36:54.327
They bring them scraps of food.

01:36:54.410 --> 01:36:58.538
Let's see if we can get you
something to eat.

01:37:00.582 --> 01:37:02.834
What can we do with this money?

01:37:02.918 --> 01:37:06.213
Well, there's no chance
of bribing Idris.

01:37:06.255 --> 01:37:10.259
His entire family was wiped out
by one of our artillery attacks.

01:37:12.261 --> 01:37:15.854
Now, Hassan, on the other hand,
is infinitely corruptible.

01:37:15.854 --> 01:37:19.601
For 100 dirhams,
he'll either help us escape...

01:37:19.684 --> 01:37:23.480
or he'll stab us in the back
and keep the money.

01:37:23.563 --> 01:37:25.899
I'll see if I can talk to him.

01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:31.695
The first thing I do when I get back is
book a table at Wilton's... a private room.

01:37:31.779 --> 01:37:33.239
No bloody crowds.

01:37:33.322 --> 01:37:40.837
Two pints of stout, please, guvner!
Ha! Not long now, Harry! Not long now!

01:38:01.850 --> 01:38:03.435
Trench.

01:38:03.518 --> 01:38:05.436
Please, Trench, get up.
Trench, come on.

01:41:47.191 --> 01:41:49.110
I have some money.

01:41:49.152 --> 01:41:51.154
Money's no good for me.

01:41:54.532 --> 01:41:58.119
I can't bribe
the guards anymore.

01:41:58.203 --> 01:42:12.424
I have nothing left to lose... nothing
left to live for... but still, I'm frightened.

01:42:29.858 --> 01:42:32.569
Fear always remains.

01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:36.989
Pray for me, Abou.

01:42:38.866 --> 01:42:40.993
Take as long as you like.

01:42:55.591 --> 01:42:58.886
I don't walk too proudly now.

01:43:07.770 --> 01:43:09.230
Stop.

01:43:21.074 --> 01:43:22.492
Have some food.

01:43:25.787 --> 01:43:27.913
You're looking better.

01:43:29.999 --> 01:43:31.751
You may not feel it,
but you look it.

01:43:31.917 --> 01:43:35.880
When I get better,
will I look as bad as you?

01:43:35.963 --> 01:43:37.715
We'll get you through this,
Trench.

01:43:40.384 --> 01:43:42.678
I don't want to get
through this, Harry.

01:43:45.305 --> 01:43:48.892
I don't think
I can take it anymore.

01:43:53.855 --> 01:43:55.190
I had a visitor today.

01:43:56.942 --> 01:43:59.069
He brought us a gift.

01:44:12.123 --> 01:44:14.501
The poison will take
a few hours to work.

01:44:17.003 --> 01:44:18.587
You won't feel any pain.

01:44:18.670 --> 01:44:20.714
That'll make a change.

01:44:26.303 --> 01:44:27.513
Careful.

01:44:27.596 --> 01:44:29.723
I didn't mean
to be a pig about it.

01:44:33.394 --> 01:44:36.688
How about we give them
one last night of hell?

01:44:36.771 --> 01:44:39.232
I'll drink to that!

01:47:22.390 --> 01:47:23.890
Oh, Trench.

01:47:26.018 --> 01:47:28.437
I can't feel anything
in my legs.

01:47:28.520 --> 01:47:30.731
The poison has paralyzed
your body.

01:47:30.814 --> 01:47:32.149
It'll wear off soon.

01:47:32.191 --> 01:47:37.154
- I thought it was supposed to kill me.
- Only for a while.

01:47:37.196 --> 01:47:40.157
You mean, you knew?

01:47:40.199 --> 01:47:42.200
I couldn't be short-changed.

01:47:42.283 --> 01:47:45.662
That's the last time
I let you buy the drink.

01:48:07.975 --> 01:48:09.935
How many bullets?

01:48:10.019 --> 01:48:10.478
One.

01:48:13.564 --> 01:48:16.066
Better make it count.

01:48:17.943 --> 01:48:18.652
No.

01:48:18.735 --> 01:48:20.378
I can't carry him.

01:48:21.696 --> 01:48:23.115
You can.

01:48:24.574 --> 01:48:26.493
Save my friend.

01:48:27.411 --> 01:48:28.745
Save my friend.

01:52:59.172 --> 01:53:01.258
Look after your friend.

01:53:01.741 --> 01:53:04.427
What will you do now?

01:53:06.045 --> 01:53:08.889
Whatever God has chosen for me.

01:54:01.490 --> 01:54:03.442
Do I look that bad?

01:54:13.034 --> 01:54:16.288
Everyone said how...
much you'd changed.

01:54:18.915 --> 01:54:22.002
I didn't believe them.

01:54:34.638 --> 01:54:36.690
May I have it back?

01:54:39.143 --> 01:54:41.062
That isn't why I came.

01:54:41.104 --> 01:54:44.232
I'd still like it back.

01:55:05.418 --> 01:55:08.713
I'm almost sorry to let it go.

01:55:14.144 --> 01:55:19.265
It's brought me a lot of luck...
over these past few months.

01:55:41.328 --> 01:55:43.622
Have you heard our news?

01:55:43.664 --> 01:55:45.707
Yes.

01:55:51.171 --> 01:55:52.714
How is Jack?

01:55:55.633 --> 01:55:57.427
I think he's happy.

01:55:57.510 --> 01:55:59.429
Good.

01:56:04.317 --> 01:56:06.478
He deserves to be.

01:56:09.688 --> 01:56:10.940
So do you.

01:56:32.127 --> 01:56:33.987
It will pass.

01:56:37.424 --> 01:56:40.010
You will meet someone soon.

01:56:40.093 --> 01:56:43.429
Then you and her
and Jack and I...

01:56:43.429 --> 01:56:45.139
Yes.

01:56:45.139 --> 01:56:50.969
...will set up tea and chat politely as if...
as if nothing ever happened with us before.

01:56:56.859 --> 01:56:58.945
That won't happen, Ethne.

01:57:02.956 --> 01:57:04.783
It has to happen.

01:57:06.994 --> 01:57:09.705
It has to because I love you...

01:57:09.788 --> 01:57:11.749
Harry.

01:57:15.169 --> 01:57:18.630
I love you and I can't...

01:57:26.429 --> 01:57:27.889
I'm sorry.

01:57:55.666 --> 01:57:59.086
Was that Ethne's carriage
outside?

01:57:59.127 --> 01:58:01.755
She is giving me a ride
to the station.

01:58:04.299 --> 01:58:05.909
Why didn't she come out?

01:58:05.909 --> 01:58:09.679
I think she wanted to give us
a minute or two alone.

01:58:10.263 --> 01:58:13.725
Do we need
a minute or two alone, Harry?

01:58:18.938 --> 01:58:22.859
- I came to thank you, Jack.
- For what?

01:58:22.942 --> 01:58:25.361
For standing by me.

01:58:29.949 --> 01:58:32.701
If you're talking about the
feathers I wasn't there.

01:58:32.701 --> 01:58:34.578
Willoughby told me you were.

01:58:40.334 --> 01:58:42.711
You don't owe me anything,
Harry.

01:58:43.194 --> 01:58:47.132
The wedding isn't for another month.
Ethne is free to make up her own mind.

01:58:47.215 --> 01:58:49.200
She's made up her mind.

01:58:52.637 --> 01:58:54.389
You should trust her judgment.

02:00:44.787 --> 02:00:47.706
To Castleton and all the others
we left behind.

02:00:47.790 --> 02:00:49.208
Indeed.

02:00:57.966 --> 02:01:00.552
You remember the first time we
led a cavalry charge in public?

02:01:00.635 --> 02:01:04.347
Yes, I do, Jack.
You wiped the floor with me.

02:01:04.350 --> 02:01:07.225
I believe most of my horses
ended up in the bandstand.

02:01:07.535 --> 02:01:10.937
Yes, I did, and...
yes, they did.

02:01:13.440 --> 02:01:17.401
Ethne was there... watching.

02:01:17.485 --> 02:01:20.738
- Yes, I remember.
- You should.

02:01:20.780 --> 02:01:22.932
You're the only one
she danced with.

02:01:24.450 --> 02:01:28.746
I've never been so jealous.

02:01:28.788 --> 02:01:32.123
I wanted to prove to her
that I was the better soldier.

02:01:32.127 --> 02:01:33.750
Well, you always were
the better soldier, Jack.

02:01:33.792 --> 02:01:35.710
Yes, of course, but...

02:01:42.801 --> 02:01:49.673
She was the first person I looked for in
the crowd and she was staring at you.

02:01:51.684 --> 02:01:58.232
Everyone else was applauding
me and she was staring at you.

02:02:06.765 --> 02:02:08.367
Nothing's changed.

02:02:14.431 --> 02:02:17.343
She's beautiful...

02:02:17.627 --> 02:02:19.504
isn't she?

02:02:23.465 --> 02:02:25.425
Yes, she is.

02:02:48.615 --> 02:02:54.329
You may be lost...
but you are not forgotten.

02:02:58.374 --> 02:03:06.757
For those who have journeyed
far to fight in foreign lands

02:03:06.841 --> 02:03:14.681
know that the soldier's greatest comfort
is to have his friends close at hand.

02:03:14.764 --> 02:03:17.392
Welcome home, Harry.

02:03:19.269 --> 02:03:22.689
Thank you, sir.

02:03:22.772 --> 02:03:34.867
In the heat of battle it ceases to be
an idea for which we fight... or a flag.

02:03:35.251 --> 02:03:38.037
Rather...

02:03:38.121 --> 02:03:43.251
we fight for the man
on our left

02:03:43.334 --> 02:03:48.546
and we fight for the man
on our right...

02:03:51.425 --> 02:03:54.553
...and when armies
have scattered...

02:03:54.636 --> 02:04:00.803
...and when the empires
fall away...

02:04:01.477 --> 02:04:11.111
all that remains is the memory
of those precious moments...

02:04:15.657 --> 02:04:18.618
...we spent side by side.

02:04:48.113 --> 02:04:49.898
Forgive me.

02:04:49.982 --> 02:04:52.401
I did you a great wrong.

02:04:52.484 --> 02:04:55.016
There is nothing to forgive.

02:04:55.019 --> 02:04:58.072
Yes, there is. I should've
stood by you, Harry.

02:04:58.156 --> 02:04:59.991
I should've understood.

02:05:01.826 --> 02:05:05.079
I used to be so sure
about everything.

02:05:05.163 --> 02:05:08.249
We both were, Ethne.

02:05:08.333 --> 02:05:10.293
And now?

02:05:20.761 --> 02:05:22.596
And now...

02:05:24.098 --> 02:05:33.438
Well... well, now I have no choice,
Ethne. God put you in my way.
