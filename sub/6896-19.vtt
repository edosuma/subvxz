WEBVTT

00:07.091 --> 00:10.968
Thanks to Rex's Old Republic map
and the map Zeb's Lasat friends made,

00:11.053 --> 00:14.013
I believe we finally have
a suitable location for our base.

00:14.098 --> 00:15.682
The Yawst system.

00:15.766 --> 00:17.517
There's no sign of the Empire,

00:17.601 --> 00:20.019
but there's a small habitable moon,

00:20.104 --> 00:22.939
one that I think will provide
everything you need.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.692
Promising, but Yawst
is several parsecs away,

00:25.776 --> 00:28.528
and our carrier does not have
enough fuel to complete the journey.

00:28.612 --> 00:31.322
We can't afford to leave it
unguarded and immobile.

00:31.407 --> 00:33.950
Well, I've been tracking
Imperial fuel shipments.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.869
There's one scheduled
to arrive at the Horizon Base soon.

00:36.954 --> 00:38.204
It's risky.

00:38.288 --> 00:40.957
The Empire's tightened security
at all its depots in the sector.

00:41.041 --> 00:43.793
lf there's fuel there,
what choice do we have?

01:06.734 --> 01:09.777
All right. After we grab the fuel, we'll
have to blast our way out of here fast.

01:09.862 --> 01:11.070
Chopper, be ready.

01:24.918 --> 01:27.837
Yeah. That droid leg
kinda does look like yours.

01:31.675 --> 01:33.509
Chopper, we're not here to shop.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.845
Shop... Shopper!

01:40.017 --> 01:42.435
This mission is important
and dangerous.

01:43.687 --> 01:44.771
Not now.

01:44.855 --> 01:47.815
We need you on the Ghost
to monitor Imperial transmissions.

01:47.900 --> 01:51.569
Hey! Let us know the second
the Empire suspects anything.

01:56.200 --> 02:00.369
You heard her. Stay at your post
and get a leg up on the Empire, yeah?

02:00.454 --> 02:04.499
Yeah, "Shopper." "Shopper."

02:30.400 --> 02:33.402
I see someone's interested
in a new strut.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.904
One that matches.

02:37.658 --> 02:38.991
Don't worry.

02:39.076 --> 02:41.953
I won't charge you
an arm and a leg for it.

02:47.417 --> 02:50.044
Kanan was right.
There's more security than ever.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.922
We can't afford to leave
without getting what we came for.

02:55.050 --> 02:56.008
There's the fuel.

02:56.093 --> 02:59.971
-Let's get it.
-Okay, but we do it quietly this time.

03:00.055 --> 03:02.265
-No complications.
-Sure.

03:06.645 --> 03:07.812
You can look,

03:07.896 --> 03:12.441
but keep your manipulators off
the merchandise unless you're buying.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.696
Stolen? No!

03:17.322 --> 03:20.575
Some of my treasures
may be unregistered, yes,

03:20.659 --> 03:23.369
but it's not important
where it comes from.

03:23.453 --> 03:25.705
It is the quality that matters.

03:28.584 --> 03:31.002
Sounds like trouble at the Imperial port.

03:31.587 --> 03:33.504
Now, are you gonna
buy the leg or what?

03:36.800 --> 03:39.385
500. Do you want it or not?

03:41.221 --> 03:44.640
Credits? What do I look like, a Senator?

03:44.725 --> 03:46.684
Where's your owner anyway?

03:50.022 --> 03:52.815
Independent? A droid?

03:53.650 --> 03:56.694
You mean you're broke.
Go on! Get out of here.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.571
You're wasting my time.

03:58.655 --> 04:00.364
Greetings, fine sir.

04:00.449 --> 04:03.868
I see you have a taste
for quality motivator plugs.

04:16.048 --> 04:17.840
Wait. Where's that leg?

04:20.844 --> 04:21.928
Hey!

04:23.013 --> 04:24.013
I've been robbed!

04:24.890 --> 04:26.390
Stop, thief!

04:31.480 --> 04:35.775
Hey, trooper, sir. That droid
with the orange crop top is a thief.

04:35.859 --> 04:37.485
He just stole a leg from me.

04:37.569 --> 04:40.571
There's been a rebel heist.
Could be connected. I'll call it in.

04:54.211 --> 04:55.294
Where'd he go?

04:55.379 --> 04:58.422
Cargo transport 241, you are all clear.

05:00.217 --> 05:01.384
This way.

05:17.067 --> 05:18.943
Keep watch for possible stowaways.

05:19.027 --> 05:22.113
There was a report of more rebels
on the platform before we took off.

05:22.197 --> 05:24.657
Rebels again?
That's the third time this rotation.

05:42.259 --> 05:43.217
Captain.

05:43.301 --> 05:48.139
The nav computer
is off-calculation by .002.

05:48.515 --> 05:53.019
You're an inventory droid,
not a navigator, you old clanker.

05:53.103 --> 05:54.937
Go log the manifest.

05:55.022 --> 05:57.773
It is against my programing protocol

05:57.858 --> 06:00.818
to allow this Imperial vessel or its cargo

06:00.902 --> 06:02.903
to be late for its scheduled deliveries.

06:04.114 --> 06:07.324
I can't wait
until your replacement gets here.

06:07.409 --> 06:11.871
After you program it, we're gonna
shuffle you off to the scrap heap.

06:11.955 --> 06:14.999
Now get outta here,
and go log the manifest!

06:18.462 --> 06:22.089
Sir, we've begun a search. lf any rebels
got on board, we'll find them.

06:30.348 --> 06:34.143
That's odd.
This hatch should be sealed.

06:34.644 --> 06:37.021
Hello? ls anyone there?

06:39.649 --> 06:41.650
Hello? Who's there?

06:42.277 --> 06:44.987
This is a restricted area.

06:45.072 --> 06:48.824
ls someone there?
I must see your credentials.

07:08.512 --> 07:09.720
I know what you are.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.847
A stowaway.

07:14.351 --> 07:17.144
You are not authorized to be here.

07:20.440 --> 07:24.193
Imperial droid? No, I think not.

07:25.195 --> 07:26.403
Who am I?

07:26.488 --> 07:30.533
I am AP-5, the Imperial inventory droid,

07:30.617 --> 07:33.828
charged with the safe transport
of this vessel's cargo.

07:33.912 --> 07:37.373
I have logged every item
and crew member on this ship,

07:37.457 --> 07:40.835
and you are certainly not on my list.

07:48.802 --> 07:52.388
Why are you carrying
an extra ambulatory strut?

07:54.724 --> 07:58.310
This strut is a replacement
for your mismatched one.

07:58.395 --> 08:02.690
Your suspicious manner
leads me to calculate that you stole it.

08:02.774 --> 08:06.569
You must be the rebel fugitive
the stormtroopers are looking for.

08:09.406 --> 08:10.990
Come back, thief!

08:12.909 --> 08:15.536
You can run,
but there will be no escape.

08:18.456 --> 08:20.666
There's no way out of the cargo bay.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.960
You've only trapped yourself.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.800
You must have
a malfunctioning logic circuit

08:29.885 --> 08:33.179
to accidentally board
an Imperial freighter.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.726
There's no need for violence.

08:40.103 --> 08:43.022
Wait. That is a spark projector.

08:43.106 --> 08:45.858
Only military models
are equipped with those.

08:47.736 --> 08:49.445
A war hero?

08:52.699 --> 08:56.202
Well, "Chopper,"
I also served in the Clone Wars,

08:56.286 --> 08:59.371
as a military analyst
on a Republic warship.

09:01.625 --> 09:04.543
I was also part of the Ryloth campaign.

09:04.628 --> 09:08.047
You know, our tactical
strategies were only 70% effective.

09:10.467 --> 09:12.760
Your Y-wing was shot down?

09:12.844 --> 09:16.597
Yes, they always were a bit buggy
during atmospheric operations.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.515
How did you avoid the scrap heap?

09:20.644 --> 09:23.479
Rescued? No one rescues droids.

09:27.025 --> 09:28.567
She must be very brave.

09:28.652 --> 09:31.111
You're fortunate
to have someone who cares.

09:31.196 --> 09:34.907
My commander did not survive,
and I was downgraded after the war.

09:38.328 --> 09:41.580
I was the best
Republic navigator in my class,

09:41.665 --> 09:44.583
but when the Empire took control,

09:44.668 --> 09:47.253
I was reassigned
to inventory duty here.

09:49.798 --> 09:51.423
It is not a waste.

09:51.508 --> 09:55.135
I do not mind being relegated
to a tedious occupation,

09:55.220 --> 09:59.932
despite the constant disrespect
from my Imperial supervisors.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.310
It is not pathetic.

10:03.395 --> 10:06.146
I have been given my orders.
I must obey them.

10:07.524 --> 10:11.193
What other options?
I am bound by my protocol.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.739
Yes, free will sounds nice.

10:15.824 --> 10:17.783
I admire your fortitude.

10:17.867 --> 10:21.745
Inventory droid, report!
Where's that manifest?

10:22.497 --> 10:23.622
Yes, Captain.

10:23.707 --> 10:27.376
It is... I... I will have it in a moment.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.045
You'd better, old clanker!

10:30.130 --> 10:32.464
Keep an eye out for stowaway rebels.

10:32.549 --> 10:36.468
They get by on your watch,
I'll put you in the melter myself.

10:37.512 --> 10:40.472
I must report... I...

10:42.225 --> 10:45.978
I have not seen any rebels
aboard this vessel.

10:46.062 --> 10:48.731
Good. Now get me that manifest.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.151
Wait. What... What are you doing?

10:52.235 --> 10:53.569
I did not report you!

10:55.655 --> 10:59.033
My restraining bolt.
You... You freed me.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.580
What are you planning to do now?

11:09.085 --> 11:11.337
Lure the crew into the cargo hold,

11:11.421 --> 11:13.255
jettison it into space?

11:13.340 --> 11:18.093
But I am responsible for every piece of
inventory aboard this vessel.

11:19.763 --> 11:20.763
Hey, droid!

11:24.267 --> 11:27.269
Where is the manifest?
What have you been doing?

11:27.354 --> 11:30.606
I am attending to my protocols.

11:30.690 --> 11:33.817
Who removed your restraining bolt?

11:33.902 --> 11:36.695
Let's get a new one on you now.

11:37.822 --> 11:38.947
What the...

11:40.116 --> 11:42.201
Where'd you come from? Hey!

11:45.580 --> 11:47.164
Captain to security.

11:47.248 --> 11:50.209
I've got the rebel on level two.
It's a droid.

11:50.293 --> 11:51.710
On our way, sir.

11:51.795 --> 11:55.339
You must be cross-wired
to come after me with this.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.935
I can't believe what you just did.

12:08.019 --> 12:10.104
Now we're both going to be in trouble.

12:11.981 --> 12:14.566
I am guilty by association.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.029
Have you heard from the Captain?

12:19.114 --> 12:21.657
Yeah. He reported that
he captured a rebel droid.

12:22.659 --> 12:24.326
Wait. What are you doing?

12:26.162 --> 12:29.415
That plan has
a 10.5% chance of success.

12:31.835 --> 12:33.001
Hey, you. Stop!

12:36.714 --> 12:39.049
It's still a terrible plan.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.554
He's going down corridor G6.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.517
We found the rebel droid.
We're tracking him.

13:03.158 --> 13:05.784
Split up and cut him off.
You two, with me.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.000
We've got him now.

13:18.548 --> 13:19.548
Blast him!

13:30.268 --> 13:32.686
Hurry. Hurry!

13:35.523 --> 13:37.733
-Wait. Wait!
-Stop them!

13:38.234 --> 13:39.234
You trapped them.

13:49.496 --> 13:51.872
I admit, that was a good plan.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.584
You, captain?

13:55.668 --> 13:59.630
You're woefully unqualified.
I am the captain.

14:01.007 --> 14:03.926
No, the first one to the bridge
is not the captain.

14:04.010 --> 14:05.093
Come back here!

14:07.222 --> 14:08.722
We have to go back for Chopper.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.891
I warned him
not to get distracted by that leg.

14:10.975 --> 14:12.518
You don't even know
if that's what happened.

14:12.602 --> 14:13.852
I know.

14:13.937 --> 14:16.522
I know that droid.
He's always thinking about himself.

14:16.606 --> 14:18.524
But we have to think
about the fleet first.

14:18.608 --> 14:20.651
Phoenix Home to Ghost, come in.

14:20.735 --> 14:23.362
We read you, Commander Sato.
We're inbound with the fuel.

14:23.446 --> 14:25.531
You must hurry. We are under attack.

14:33.456 --> 14:37.167
Sir, a rebel ship that escaped the
Horizon Base has entered the system.

14:37.252 --> 14:41.296
So that's why their fleet hasn't
attempted to jump. They need fuel.

14:41.631 --> 14:43.590
Order our fighters to intercept that ship.

14:43.675 --> 14:45.717
Keep it from docking at all costs.

14:48.972 --> 14:51.014
Looks like we're getting
special attention!

14:55.770 --> 14:58.146
My guns are offline.
My guns are offline!

15:01.067 --> 15:02.317
Ketsu.

15:02.652 --> 15:05.070
Shadowcaster to Ghost.
I'm on your wing.

15:05.154 --> 15:06.905
Copy that, Ketsu. Thanks.

15:13.204 --> 15:17.207
All right. Because of your help,
I'll allow you to be captain.

15:17.292 --> 15:20.794
I'll hold your ambulatory strut
while you take the helm.

15:32.557 --> 15:34.725
What? You abandoned your post.

15:42.942 --> 15:46.236
Why are you changing course?
Where are you taking us?

15:47.530 --> 15:50.198
The rebel fleet? Why would I go there?

15:52.368 --> 15:55.537
How do I know your rebels
will treat me better than the Empire?

15:57.373 --> 15:59.666
Because I am your friend?

16:11.012 --> 16:12.929
Zeb, two incoming at point seven.

16:14.891 --> 16:18.060
They can get in line.
There's more fighters than I can shoot!

16:19.562 --> 16:21.146
Then there's no excuse for missing.

16:21.230 --> 16:24.483
Ghost to Shadowcaster,
we need to land and refuel the carrier.

16:24.567 --> 16:25.859
I'll clear a path.

16:29.781 --> 16:32.366
-Thanks for the assist, Ketsu.
-You owe me one.

16:34.744 --> 16:37.037
Everyone, get ready!
We're coming in hot!

16:37.246 --> 16:38.413
Look out!

16:53.054 --> 16:54.680
Zeb, Ezra, the fuel.

16:54.972 --> 16:56.098
We're on it.

17:03.898 --> 17:06.066
C1-10P, where are you?

17:08.444 --> 17:11.363
Really? So you didn't leave
the Ghost to go after that leg?

17:13.741 --> 17:14.991
I don't have time for this.

17:15.076 --> 17:18.704
We're still trying to refuel the carrier
so we can jump to the Yawst system.

17:18.788 --> 17:21.289
The Yawst system? No. No, no, no.

17:21.374 --> 17:24.668
I'm afraid the Yawst system
will not be safe for your friends at all.

17:26.421 --> 17:29.506
The Empire's data network
reports an Imperial fleet

17:29.590 --> 17:32.509
has recently been dispatched
to that system.

17:32.593 --> 17:34.845
It appears to be a trap of some kind.

17:37.140 --> 17:39.307
The Empire's waiting for us
in the Yawst system?

17:39.392 --> 17:40.434
How do you know that?

17:42.311 --> 17:44.771
You stole an Imperial freighter?

17:44.856 --> 17:47.149
Hera, refueling's finished.
Let's get out of here.

17:47.233 --> 17:49.985
Hold that thought.
Chopper, are you sure it's a trap?

17:51.362 --> 17:54.030
Then we need new coordinates
to a safe system, now.

17:54.115 --> 17:57.534
We could cross-reference your data
with the Imperial network.

18:05.293 --> 18:07.919
Captain Syndulla, the fleet must jump.
Are you ready?

18:08.004 --> 18:09.838
Commander Sato,
I have received new intel.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.048
Yawst is now controlled by the Empire.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.301
But we have
new escape coordinates incoming.

18:14.385 --> 18:16.386
New coordinates? To where?

18:16.471 --> 18:18.930
Somewhere better than here.
Chopper, hurry!

18:19.515 --> 18:20.766
Hold it!

18:20.850 --> 18:22.726
Get away from there!

18:22.810 --> 18:25.187
Your rebel mutiny is over.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.354
What took you so long?

18:26.689 --> 18:29.524
This rogue astromech
has taken me prisoner.

18:29.609 --> 18:34.488
You outdated shell of circuits.
You are completely useless!

18:34.572 --> 18:37.657
No, you are the one who is useless.

18:37.742 --> 18:40.327
What did you say, droid?

18:44.081 --> 18:46.124
Not this time, you little...

18:48.961 --> 18:50.754
Where are those coordinates?

18:51.923 --> 18:56.009
Sorry, Chopper is unavailable
at the moment.

18:56.093 --> 18:59.137
-Who is this?
-I am Chopper's friend.

18:59.222 --> 19:00.263
Friend?

19:00.348 --> 19:01.807
Chopper doesn't have any friends.

19:01.891 --> 19:03.475
He most certainly does.

19:03.559 --> 19:08.522
Just as when he was rescued from that
Y-wing fighter, I am rescuing him now.

19:08.606 --> 19:12.192
Chopper helped me,
and I have chosen to help Chopper.

19:15.571 --> 19:19.825
I believe together we have isolated
a safe system for your rebel fleet.

19:19.909 --> 19:21.326
Rebel fleet?

19:21.410 --> 19:22.911
Just send the coordinates!

19:23.454 --> 19:25.914
Transmitting coordinates now.

19:52.149 --> 19:53.733
Transmission coming through.

19:53.818 --> 19:55.569
Sato, I have the new coordinates.

20:01.617 --> 20:02.701
Jump!

20:02.785 --> 20:05.245
The entire rebel fleet
is betting on Chopper.

20:05.329 --> 20:07.122
Yeah. Try not to think about it.

20:19.927 --> 20:25.098
I... I won't forget you, my... My friend.

20:37.820 --> 20:39.404
The planet checks out.

20:39.488 --> 20:41.406
Chopper really came through this time.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.742
-So did his new friend.
-How's he doing?

20:43.826 --> 20:46.286
I'll go see.
Sabine's been working on him.

20:53.628 --> 20:57.088
What... What happened? Where am I?

20:57.173 --> 20:59.257
Don't worry. You're alive and well.

20:59.342 --> 21:00.926
I replaced
your damaged thermo sensors

21:01.010 --> 21:03.345
with the ones
from the leg Chopper stole.

21:03.596 --> 21:04.763
Chopper?

21:08.809 --> 21:12.354
You sacrificed
your replacement leg for me.

21:13.189 --> 21:15.231
Well, you shouldn't have.

21:15.316 --> 21:18.193
I knew you had
a malfunctioning logic circuit.

21:19.862 --> 21:21.696
That sort of language confirms it.

21:21.781 --> 21:25.158
You could be disintegrated
in six systems for saying such things.

21:25.242 --> 21:27.285
I might just report you myself.

21:28.496 --> 21:29.704
No, don't give me that.
