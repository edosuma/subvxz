WEBVTT

00:50.484 --> 00:52.720
Keep the nose coming around.

00:54.522 --> 00:58.526
And watch the horizon.

00:58.560 --> 00:59.426
That's it.

01:27.387 --> 01:28.188
Rachel.

01:29.023 --> 01:30.525
Hello?

01:30.558 --> 01:32.894
Haven't you have some
news for your Dad?

01:32.927 --> 01:35.362
I got into Little Shop
of Horrors at school.

01:35.395 --> 01:36.864
Well done Pumpkin.

01:36.898 --> 01:38.198
Not the part I was going for,

01:38.231 --> 01:39.433
but it's still good to be in it.

01:39.466 --> 01:41.168
What part
did you go for?

01:41.201 --> 01:42.369
Audrey of course.

01:42.402 --> 01:44.038
She's the lead.

01:44.072 --> 01:45.773
Makayla and Ashleigh said
I did the best audition

01:45.807 --> 01:47.542
and they reckon I
should've got the role.

01:47.575 --> 01:49.376
Well, you've never
had a lead role before!

01:49.409 --> 01:50.745
I can hope.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.412
What does it say on
Mom's fridge magnet?

01:52.446 --> 01:55.617
"Believe in yourself,
follow your dreams."

01:55.650 --> 01:57.051
So what part did you get?

01:58.653 --> 01:59.419
Crystal.

02:01.321 --> 02:03.725
And are you happy
to be in the show?

02:03.758 --> 02:06.226
Yeah, yeah, I'm
stoked to be in it.

02:06.259 --> 02:07.762
That's good.

02:07.795 --> 02:10.064
It's a fun musical
and I can't wait

02:10.098 --> 02:11.733
for rehearsals to start.

02:11.766 --> 02:12.967
Well, you can tell
your drama teacher

02:13.001 --> 02:14.636
if she needs any help
with the costumes

02:14.669 --> 02:16.370
with the costumes
I can be there.

02:16.403 --> 02:17.471
Okay thanks Mom.

02:23.310 --> 02:24.646
Rachel's parent
teacher interviews

02:24.679 --> 02:26.781
are Thursday at 6:30.

02:26.814 --> 02:28.082
Are you coming?

02:28.116 --> 02:29.383
Of course.

02:29.416 --> 02:30.384
Have I ever missed one of

02:30.417 --> 02:32.754
Rachel's parent
teacher interviews?

02:32.787 --> 02:34.055
Her teachers all
love her to bits

02:34.088 --> 02:35.422
just like her Daddy does.

02:39.292 --> 02:40.494
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

02:40.528 --> 02:42.396
I got offered a
promotion on Friday.

02:42.429 --> 02:44.932
Hm, I like
the sound of that.

03:05.553 --> 03:06.319
Bill.

03:07.287 --> 03:08.321
You wanted to see me?

03:08.355 --> 03:09.691
Just a second Nick.

03:18.132 --> 03:19.332
I'm very pleased
to tell you that we

03:19.366 --> 03:21.169
have scored that
Wentworth contract.

03:21.201 --> 03:22.970
The partners are pretty chuffed.

03:24.337 --> 03:25.606
We want you to
stop working on the

03:25.640 --> 03:26.641
Northland Aerospace job

03:26.674 --> 03:29.342
and take over as project
manager for Wentworth

03:29.376 --> 03:31.145
as Technical Support
Chief Engineer.

03:32.513 --> 03:34.816
You'll have a team of
four including Bill Yates,

03:34.849 --> 03:36.483
Eric Shephard, Peter Wong,

03:36.517 --> 03:39.187
and Dave Callan who
will all report to you.

03:43.091 --> 03:44.458
This is a promotion Nick.

03:44.491 --> 03:48.228
Sorry, it's just, I'm
about three months away

03:48.261 --> 03:49.964
from finishing
the Northland job.

03:49.997 --> 03:52.734
We'll get Sanderson
to finish off for you.

03:52.767 --> 03:54.301
Salary reviews are
coming up in April

03:54.334 --> 03:57.538
and you are guaranteed
an increase.

03:57.572 --> 03:58.906
I'm guessing it will
be a decent one too.

03:58.940 --> 04:00.340
How long do you
reckon it will take

04:00.373 --> 04:02.143
to see this one through?

04:02.176 --> 04:05.179
Now, it's a big job so three
years if all goes to plan.

04:05.213 --> 04:07.682
But it could be as long as five.

04:07.715 --> 04:08.516
Are you in?

04:10.685 --> 04:11.753
Yeah, okay.

04:12.754 --> 04:13.554
Okay.

04:15.189 --> 04:15.957
Okay?

04:17.524 --> 04:19.493
Y'know Nick, I thought you you
would be as keen as mustard.

04:19.527 --> 04:22.864
I mean I fought hard to
get you to head this team.

04:22.897 --> 04:24.665
You have always
wanted to lead a team

04:24.699 --> 04:25.733
and now I offer you this

04:25.767 --> 04:27.735
and all I get is a cool "okay."

04:30.738 --> 04:31.939
Let's have a chat in my office

04:36.611 --> 04:38.212
And what did you say?

04:38.246 --> 04:39.747
I said I'll let him know.

04:41.082 --> 04:43.918
Nick, it's a
promotion for gods sake!

04:43.951 --> 04:46.254
I just need to think
about it for a few days.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.356
Well, why don't you see
if you can get a few weeks

04:49.389 --> 04:51.759
holiday in before the
job starts because,

04:51.793 --> 04:53.961
look what I got from
the travel agent today?

04:56.329 --> 04:57.799
There's a great 14
day cruise leaving

04:57.832 --> 05:00.535
from Sydney the day
after our anniversary.

05:00.568 --> 05:02.402
So I thought we could spend
our anniversary in Sydney

05:02.435 --> 05:04.138
and then start off the next day.

05:07.642 --> 05:09.911
Well, don't you even want
to know where it goes?

05:12.613 --> 05:15.149
I'm not sure that I
can get away in June.

05:15.183 --> 05:17.285
You do realize its
our 20th anniversary?

05:17.350 --> 05:20.320
I know and I'll find
something special,

05:20.353 --> 05:22.422
maybe a weekend away.

05:23.691 --> 05:25.458
How many years have you
been promising me a cruise?

05:25.492 --> 05:27.128
You always find a
reason why we can't go.

05:27.161 --> 05:28.062
She's right Dad.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.764
You've always have an excuse!

05:29.797 --> 05:32.066
Well it's not as easy as that.

05:32.099 --> 05:34.602
I have I have some work
commitments during that period.

05:38.172 --> 05:40.407
Rachel, why don't you tell Mom

05:40.440 --> 05:42.176
and Dad what happened
to Emma today?

05:43.144 --> 05:44.411
Why don't you?

05:44.444 --> 05:45.680
Well she's not
my greenie friend

05:51.152 --> 05:53.087
Emma got arrested today.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.421
What? Emma?

05:54.454 --> 05:56.757
Mm-hm, she was at
the Greenpeace march

05:56.791 --> 05:58.659
and something happened

05:58.693 --> 06:00.828
and then she ended up in
jail for over an hour.

06:00.862 --> 06:02.597
Now you see why I
didn't want you to go?

06:02.630 --> 06:04.599
Mom, there were
thousands of people there

06:04.632 --> 06:06.601
and only two people
got in trouble.

06:06.634 --> 06:07.869
Anyway, she's home now.

06:17.311 --> 06:18.946
Today's flight
was a lot of fun.

06:18.980 --> 06:22.116
I really really want
to study aviation

06:22.149 --> 06:23.383
What you really
mean is you'd like

06:23.416 --> 06:24.785
to do a pilots training course.

06:24.819 --> 06:26.320
Well that would be super cool!

06:28.022 --> 06:29.790
Max, your Dad and I
think it's important

06:29.824 --> 06:31.391
to follow your dreams,

06:31.424 --> 06:33.160
but we'd like you to do
a bachelors degree first.

06:35.495 --> 06:37.164
Dad, you did Avionics,
so why can't I?

06:37.198 --> 06:39.967
No, the engineering
degree came first,

06:40.001 --> 06:41.802
then the avionics.

06:41.836 --> 06:44.205
I'd like you to get
your bachelors first

06:44.238 --> 06:46.406
then the whole
world's your oyster.

06:46.439 --> 06:47.675
I nearly forgot.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.744
You've got some very
interesting mail today.

06:55.683 --> 06:56.851
How was your
test today Rachel?

06:56.884 --> 06:58.819
It sucked.

06:58.853 --> 07:01.122
I hate science, I
just hope I pass.

07:03.724 --> 07:06.827
You are so full of
crap, you always say that.

07:06.861 --> 07:07.929
Ah, hello!

07:07.962 --> 07:10.231
I passed my last science
exam with "Achieved".

07:10.264 --> 07:12.566
Hardly a scholarship
you brainiac.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.771
Aren't you gonna
open the letter?

07:22.310 --> 07:24.712
I already know what's inside..

07:24.745 --> 07:25.713
And?

07:37.825 --> 07:40.428
I received an email
a few weeks ago,

07:41.729 --> 07:44.732
I was just waiting for the
right time to tell you.

07:44.765 --> 07:45.566
Tell me what?

07:48.903 --> 07:50.171
It's from MarsX.

07:52.273 --> 07:53.407
Are you serious?

07:54.942 --> 07:59.947
I have applied for one of
the 24 slots to go to mars

08:02.817 --> 08:06.921
and I've been shortlisted
as one of 100 applicants.

08:11.258 --> 08:13.327
No you have not.

08:13.361 --> 08:14.962
There were over
200,000 applicants,

08:14.996 --> 08:16.731
so I didn't think
I had a chance.

08:16.764 --> 08:19.066
C'mon, you are so
full of bullshit.

08:20.801 --> 08:23.237
Mom, who's swearing now?

08:23.270 --> 08:26.007
I filled out the
application in June last year

08:26.040 --> 08:27.308
and forgot all about it.

08:29.010 --> 08:30.745
MarsX contacted me in January

08:30.778 --> 08:33.114
to set set up an
online interview

08:33.147 --> 08:34.914
for their chief medical officer,

08:34.948 --> 08:36.450
which I did the following week

08:36.484 --> 08:37.918
and I probably
should've told you then,

08:37.952 --> 08:40.453
but I still didn't think
I had a chance in hell.

08:41.455 --> 08:42.655
Show me the letter.

08:49.830 --> 08:51.766
Are you frigging kidding me?

08:51.799 --> 08:53.502
You've applied to go to Mars?

08:55.636 --> 08:56.937
Tell me you are not serious!

08:56.971 --> 08:58.873
Its only an
application, that's all.

08:58.906 --> 09:00.341
An application?

09:00.374 --> 09:01.842
It's more than a
bloody application!

09:01.876 --> 09:05.046
You have been shortlisted!

09:09.250 --> 09:10.618
Wait a minute.

09:10.651 --> 09:12.353
I'm not gonna fall for that one.

09:12.386 --> 09:13.988
You're so pulling my leg.

09:20.327 --> 09:21.228
Is this for real?

09:22.563 --> 09:23.397
It's for real.

09:25.032 --> 09:27.536
If this it's a joke, I
don't think it's funny.

09:29.837 --> 09:31.472
Mom, I think
Dad's being serious.

09:31.506 --> 09:33.441
That letter is for real.

09:39.213 --> 09:40.815
You're considering
going to Mars

09:40.848 --> 09:43.717
and you never even
discussed this with me?

09:43.751 --> 09:44.553
Dad!

09:50.891 --> 09:53.394
So how long does that
mean you have to be away?

09:59.200 --> 10:00.835
It's a one-way trip.

10:01.936 --> 10:02.837
One way?

10:02.870 --> 10:05.172
It is currently the only way

10:05.206 --> 10:08.843
that they can get people on
Mars within the next 20 years.

10:08.876 --> 10:12.079
But with technology
advancing the way that it is,

10:12.113 --> 10:13.881
there's a real chance
of a return flight

10:13.914 --> 10:15.416
at some point in the future.

10:17.318 --> 10:19.353
So when is
this happening then?

10:19.386 --> 10:23.924
2031, so it's a long way off,

10:23.958 --> 10:25.192
but I would have to travel

10:25.226 --> 10:27.294
to the States for
training sometime soon.

10:29.663 --> 10:32.032
Forgive me but I'm
having real difficulty

10:32.066 --> 10:33.367
understanding this.

10:33.400 --> 10:36.103
Are you telling me you're
prepared to leave this family,

10:36.137 --> 10:37.872
leave me, leave your kids,

10:37.905 --> 10:39.541
your mother and
all of your friends

10:39.574 --> 10:41.942
and just go off to Mars
for the rest of your life

10:41.976 --> 10:43.644
with people you've
never even met?

10:43.677 --> 10:45.312
Was Neil Armstrong wrong

10:45.346 --> 10:48.048
because he wanted to be
the first man on the moon?

10:48.082 --> 10:50.985
Christopher Columbus,
Francis Drake,

10:51.018 --> 10:52.086
Yuri Gagarin!

10:52.119 --> 10:54.989
I mean, where would
we be if brave people

10:55.022 --> 10:56.957
didn't step out and take a risk?

10:56.991 --> 10:58.058
You're missing the point.

10:58.092 --> 10:59.894
No, none of the
great explorers

10:59.927 --> 11:01.795
had their return guaranteed!

11:02.930 --> 11:04.999
You are leaving your family.

11:10.137 --> 11:13.007
This wasn't the right
time to bring this up.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.008
And when was the
right time Nick?

11:14.041 --> 11:15.577
Were you going to wait until I

11:15.610 --> 11:17.912
read about it in the newspaper?

12:59.380 --> 13:00.114
Same one?

13:02.449 --> 13:04.118
Why won't you tell me?

13:04.151 --> 13:05.853
This has been going
on for months.

13:05.886 --> 13:06.655
I'm sorry.

13:08.757 --> 13:10.157
Just go back to sleep.

13:11.660 --> 13:14.028
If it happens again, I will
go into the spare room.

13:14.061 --> 13:15.563
I haven't been to sleep.

13:16.731 --> 13:18.065
I can't sleep.

14:17.124 --> 14:18.158
Are you asleep?

14:20.394 --> 14:21.195
No.

14:28.402 --> 14:29.970
Do you remember

14:31.171 --> 14:33.307
all those years ago
when we first went out

14:35.342 --> 14:36.977
you asked me what
my dreams were,

14:40.849 --> 14:44.552
and I told you that I'd
always wanted to learn to fly,

14:45.820 --> 14:48.188
but there was always
something stopping me.

14:51.425 --> 14:53.060
Do you remember what you said?

14:55.429 --> 14:56.230
You said,

14:59.333 --> 15:00.502
"living is dreaming"

15:03.571 --> 15:05.305
Do you remember that?

15:05.339 --> 15:08.242
Yeah, well, I wasn't talking
about dumping your family

15:08.275 --> 15:09.677
and going to Mars, was I?

15:11.912 --> 15:14.682
You said that
from early childhood

15:16.183 --> 15:19.888
we're told to stop
dreaming and start living,

15:19.920 --> 15:21.422
and you said that was a mistake.

15:23.257 --> 15:25.058
You said "Living is dreaming."

15:28.295 --> 15:31.733
Yeah, I remember that.

15:31.766 --> 15:34.334
I don't want to think
about it right now.

15:34.368 --> 15:36.036
I just wish I could go to sleep

15:36.069 --> 15:39.206
and wake up and find that
this was all a bad dream.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.418
I know Mom and
Rachel are pretty stink

15:51.452 --> 15:53.253
about the whole MarsX thing but,

15:53.287 --> 15:54.321
I talked to Kevin today

15:54.354 --> 15:56.323
and he thinks its
really really cool.

15:56.356 --> 15:59.359
I reckon I'd do it if I was
old enough and they chose me.

16:00.528 --> 16:01.830
You know, I've
never told you this,

16:01.863 --> 16:04.231
but I had a dream when
I was about your age,

16:04.264 --> 16:06.233
that I went to the moon.

16:06.266 --> 16:07.301
Wow!

16:09.804 --> 16:11.539
Are you scared
about going to Mars?

16:13.073 --> 16:14.308
I'm only shortlisted.

16:15.209 --> 16:16.544
I know Kevin's
a bit of a geek,

16:16.578 --> 16:18.178
but he's knows a
lot about this stuff

16:18.212 --> 16:20.380
and he told me if you are
one of the first people

16:20.414 --> 16:23.083
people to go to Mars,
you'll be a hero.

16:23.116 --> 16:25.687
Bigger than any pop
star in the world.

16:25.720 --> 16:27.522
We're about 28 minutes

16:27.555 --> 16:29.356
already into today's spacewalk.

16:29.389 --> 16:32.226
We just got another
question from XFoot4000

16:32.259 --> 16:33.962
who wanted to know why PMA3

16:35.162 --> 16:37.297
is gonna get moved
in it's setup...

16:52.312 --> 16:54.448
Rachel has taken
this news pretty badly.

16:54.481 --> 16:56.016
She's extremely upset.

17:00.655 --> 17:02.924
The kids are in bed, I
think we need to talk.

17:05.760 --> 17:07.662
Maybe I'll pour
myself a drink first.

17:22.944 --> 17:24.945
No, I don't want a drink.

17:24.979 --> 17:27.347
I want to know what is
happening to this family.

17:27.381 --> 17:29.918
Nothing is happening
to this family.

17:29.951 --> 17:31.786
I saw a once in a lifetime
opportunity and I...

17:31.819 --> 17:34.589
Don't tell me nothing is
happening to this family!

17:34.622 --> 17:36.524
You're prepared to
walk away from us,

17:36.558 --> 17:38.593
your children and our marriage,

17:38.626 --> 17:40.160
and you tell me
nothing is happening!

17:40.193 --> 17:42.262
I saw one of the
biggest opportunities

17:42.296 --> 17:43.330
that a man could be part of...

17:43.363 --> 17:46.333
Stop the bullshit please!

17:46.366 --> 17:49.303
I want to know what is
going to happen to us.

17:49.336 --> 17:51.371
Are you seriously going to
walk away from everyone?

17:51.405 --> 17:54.341
I know that sounds dreadful

17:54.374 --> 17:55.777
and it hurts me to know

17:55.810 --> 17:57.879
that I've hurt
you by doing this,

17:57.912 --> 18:00.848
but I've thought about
this over and over,

18:00.882 --> 18:03.383
and yes, I am being
a bit selfish.

18:03.417 --> 18:04.351
Selfish?

18:04.384 --> 18:05.720
That's a bloody understatement!

18:05.753 --> 18:07.989
You know, if every
pioneer that led

18:08.022 --> 18:10.223
a major expedition
wasn't brave enough...

18:10.257 --> 18:12.827
I don't give a
stuff about pioneers

18:12.860 --> 18:15.697
or expeditions,
especially ones to Mars.

18:15.730 --> 18:17.397
Even if it turns
out to be humankind's

18:17.431 --> 18:20.334
- greatest exploration to date?
- No, I don't care.

18:27.075 --> 18:30.344
I'm scared.

18:32.412 --> 18:34.048
And I can't believe
you would do this

18:34.082 --> 18:35.850
without discussing
it with me first!

18:40.688 --> 18:41.455
I'm sorry.

18:43.558 --> 18:45.425
I should have talked
it over with you.

18:46.293 --> 18:48.062
This affects the whole family.

18:48.096 --> 18:50.364
It wasn't your decision
to make on your own.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.234
And what about Rachel?

18:54.267 --> 18:56.403
What am I supposed to say?

18:56.436 --> 18:58.438
Dad's in a new reality TV series

18:58.472 --> 19:00.508
and he wont be home for a while.

19:00.541 --> 19:02.209
Actually ever.

19:02.242 --> 19:06.446
You know, I honestly never
expected to get this far.

19:06.480 --> 19:08.883
And you say all this
as if I've been chosen.

19:10.051 --> 19:11.686
I'm only shortlisted.

19:17.324 --> 19:18.392
Nick!

19:18.425 --> 19:20.427
Will you please eat your
eggs while they're hot?

19:35.442 --> 19:36.476
Dad.

19:38.012 --> 19:39.446
You're on page three
of the Tribune.

19:39.479 --> 19:40.948
Have you seen this?

19:40.982 --> 19:43.483
"A 45 year old Auckland
Avionics engineer Nick Wilkinson

19:43.518 --> 19:45.953
"has been selected to
travel to Mars in 2031.

19:45.987 --> 19:47.955
"He is one of 100
would be astronauts

19:47.989 --> 19:49.456
"chosen for the
special training,

19:49.489 --> 19:51.159
"which is scheduled to
commence in two months time."

19:51.191 --> 19:52.492
Well that's wrong for a start.

19:52.527 --> 19:53.795
- Give it here.
- What the hell!

19:53.828 --> 19:54.829
You said shortlisted,

19:54.862 --> 19:56.097
and the paper is
saying selected.

19:56.130 --> 19:57.431
Whats going on?

19:57.464 --> 19:58.633
No, it's just
semantics that's all.

19:58.666 --> 20:00.601
I don't care about semantics.

20:00.635 --> 20:01.536
Which one is it?

20:02.670 --> 20:04.138
Okay.

20:04.172 --> 20:07.474
I am one of 100 candidates
who will take part

20:07.508 --> 20:10.444
in the many challenges that
they will throw our way.

20:10.477 --> 20:13.681
40 of us will be selected
to the next round.

20:13.715 --> 20:15.683
Then there's an
isolation challenge.

20:15.717 --> 20:17.985
30 people will make it,

20:18.019 --> 20:21.122
and then finally they will
choose six groups of four

20:21.155 --> 20:23.691
that will become
full-time employees.

20:23.725 --> 20:26.627
So I'm selected for
the program yes,

20:26.661 --> 20:29.197
but, I'm only shortlisted
for the actual mission.

20:29.229 --> 20:31.465
Well, thanks for telling me,

20:32.466 --> 20:34.168
and you didn't mention
the interview either.

20:34.202 --> 20:35.803
It happened yesterday.

20:35.837 --> 20:37.270
The journalist
came to the office

20:37.304 --> 20:39.040
and after the interview
she asked for a photo.

20:39.073 --> 20:41.642
And it wasn't important
enough to mention?

20:41.676 --> 20:43.211
I'm sorry.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.146
I completely forgot.

20:45.179 --> 20:46.547
There's just a lot

20:46.581 --> 20:48.281
going on at the moment.

20:48.315 --> 20:50.250
Kelsey and Mrs. Drake are
here, grab your bag quickly.

20:52.520 --> 20:54.354
- Bye Mom.
- Bye.

20:54.387 --> 20:55.590
Hey, what about me?

20:57.759 --> 20:58.726
Great article Dad.

21:08.669 --> 21:10.238
Dad.

21:10.270 --> 21:12.607
I was thinking about what
you said last night and,

21:13.841 --> 21:15.576
you didn't get to be
one of the 100 chosen

21:15.610 --> 21:17.779
just by filling out an
application did you?

21:19.379 --> 21:22.250
No I had to provide a medical
statement from our doctor.

21:23.584 --> 21:26.154
And?

21:26.187 --> 21:27.822
And,

21:27.855 --> 21:32.325
well, I had a call from the
MarsX Chief Medical Officer

21:32.359 --> 21:34.162
asking all sorts of questions.

21:34.195 --> 21:35.596
Why did you change
course after just

21:35.630 --> 21:37.698
one year at Auckland University?

21:37.732 --> 21:40.668
It would seem a huge
waste of a year.

21:40.701 --> 21:42.870
I couldn't settle
in Med school.

21:42.904 --> 21:45.506
It was what my parents wanted.

21:45.540 --> 21:48.375
They weren't very happy when
I changed to do engineering.

21:48.408 --> 21:49.610
Yeah, but what about you?

21:49.644 --> 21:51.512
Were you happy
with your decision?

21:51.546 --> 21:52.713
Yes.

21:52.747 --> 21:53.714
I don't think I would have gone

21:53.748 --> 21:55.283
into Avionics without
that background.

21:57.585 --> 21:58.953
Mars looks a
lot like our home,

21:58.986 --> 22:01.689
however it has an
ever present red tint.

22:01.722 --> 22:03.724
Do you know anything about that?

22:03.758 --> 22:05.259
Iron oxide.

22:05.293 --> 22:07.295
It's very common on
the planets surface.

22:09.230 --> 22:12.365
Both planets, Mars and
Earth have many similarities.

22:12.399 --> 22:14.068
What similarities
are you aware of?

22:15.636 --> 22:19.740
A Mars day is 24 hours,
39 minutes and 35 seconds,

22:19.774 --> 22:22.743
so the night day rhythm is

22:22.777 --> 22:24.779
very similar to
ours here on Earth.

22:26.747 --> 22:30.651
Mars and Earth are a similar
distances from the sun

22:30.685 --> 22:32.485
so that a Martian year,

22:32.520 --> 22:34.121
if I can I call it that,

22:35.455 --> 22:39.126
is 687 days.

22:40.328 --> 22:41.796
I think you can
call that similar.

22:43.598 --> 22:45.233
Mars has water,

22:45.266 --> 22:46.801
mostly frozen water.

22:47.935 --> 22:49.170
Even if it is trapped under the

22:49.203 --> 22:52.607
North and South
Poles polar ice caps.

22:54.342 --> 22:57.645
What are your motivations
for wanting to join MarsX?

22:57.678 --> 23:00.181
Well, there's one question
that I was expecting.

23:01.883 --> 23:04.518
I believe that it is the firsts

23:04.552 --> 23:06.354
in our history that
are remembered.

23:07.688 --> 23:11.259
I can be one of the first
people to set foot on Mars.

23:11.292 --> 23:13.561
I find that prospect
exhilarating.

23:14.862 --> 23:17.464
I don't believe
that we can continue

23:17.497 --> 23:19.432
on earth as we're going now.

23:19.466 --> 23:22.303
I think we are progressively
destroying this planet.

23:23.871 --> 23:26.707
It will be the pioneers
that go to Mars,

23:26.741 --> 23:29.210
that make the sacrifice

23:29.243 --> 23:31.712
that will ensure the
human race survives.

23:33.014 --> 23:35.816
I think that step is the next
great leap in our evolution

23:35.850 --> 23:37.484
and I want to be part of that.

23:40.755 --> 23:43.624
Mr. Wilkinson, I
note you are married

23:43.658 --> 23:44.792
with two children.

23:44.825 --> 23:46.527
You have a son of 16 years

23:46.560 --> 23:49.664
and a daughter of 14.

23:49.697 --> 23:52.333
Have you told your family
you've applied to MarsX?

23:53.534 --> 23:54.335
Yes.

23:56.771 --> 24:00.440
If you were
running low on food

24:02.009 --> 24:03.443
would you consider

24:04.879 --> 24:06.847
eating one of your
fellow Marstronauts?

24:13.854 --> 24:14.822
Quick, you're late!

24:14.855 --> 24:16.023
What did you say?

24:16.057 --> 24:17.792
No, go go go,
you'll miss your bus!

24:34.909 --> 24:37.011
Mom, can you stop and
join us for a bit?

24:37.044 --> 24:39.880
I've got something to tell
you and it's quite important.

24:47.722 --> 24:49.190
Did you see the paper today?

24:49.223 --> 24:52.460
No, we don't get it in the
middle of the week anymore.

24:53.294 --> 24:54.929
Well I'm on page three.

24:55.830 --> 24:57.264
Well, that's wonderful dear.

24:57.298 --> 24:59.433
Another award for your gliding?

24:59.467 --> 25:02.103
You know, we still have some
of your cups here you know?

25:02.136 --> 25:04.472
No, its not about gliding.

25:04.505 --> 25:06.741
Have either of you
heard of MarsX?

25:06.774 --> 25:07.708
Mars?

25:07.742 --> 25:09.043
As in the Planet?

25:09.076 --> 25:10.111
Yes.

25:10.144 --> 25:11.412
MarsX are planning to build a

25:11.445 --> 25:13.247
permanent human
settlement on Mars.

25:14.849 --> 25:16.484
Mars.

25:16.517 --> 25:18.886
We were just reminiscing
the other day, weren't we?

25:18.919 --> 25:20.588
About how obsessed you were with

25:20.621 --> 25:22.456
going to the moon
when you grew up.

25:23.924 --> 25:24.992
Not the Moon Mom.

25:27.261 --> 25:29.897
I have been shortlisted

25:29.930 --> 25:32.800
to be one of the first
humans to set foot on Mars!

25:35.036 --> 25:38.105
Mars is, a bloody
long way away.

25:38.139 --> 25:40.241
I thought you might
not believe me so,

25:40.274 --> 25:41.709
I brought the letter.

25:46.881 --> 25:49.683
So how many days does
it take to get there?

25:49.717 --> 25:52.153
The actual trip takes
about seven months.

25:53.354 --> 25:55.956
About a bit longer
than astronauts

25:55.990 --> 25:58.993
currently stay on the
International Space Station.

25:59.026 --> 26:00.961
But that's only one way.

26:02.163 --> 26:03.631
I don't think your
Mother could cope

26:03.664 --> 26:05.800
with you being
away for that long.

26:05.833 --> 26:06.867
Mom,

26:08.903 --> 26:11.540
many years ago there was

26:11.572 --> 26:14.775
an ordinary guy from
a laboring family

26:14.809 --> 26:15.876
who had a dream.

26:16.877 --> 26:19.548
His name was Captain James Cook,

26:19.580 --> 26:23.851
and he became one of the greatest
sea explorers of his age.

26:23.884 --> 26:26.387
Every New Zealander
knows who he was.

26:26.420 --> 26:27.855
What's that got to do with you

26:27.888 --> 26:29.223
wanting to be an astronaut?

26:29.256 --> 26:32.026
Well, there were
risks for James Cook.

26:32.059 --> 26:34.929
But he traveled farther
than anyone ever had.

26:36.430 --> 26:39.834
And Sir Edmund Hillary,
he's one of your idols.

26:39.867 --> 26:42.403
How many times have
you spoken his name?

26:42.436 --> 26:45.005
Yet he took huge risks.

26:45.039 --> 26:48.476
No one had managed to
climb Everest before him.

26:48.510 --> 26:52.847
But he did it and he
became a national treasure.

26:52.880 --> 26:53.747
A hero.

26:55.049 --> 26:57.552
Yes, but you would be
away for more than a year?

26:59.854 --> 27:01.255
No.

27:01.288 --> 27:04.358
This expedition is
to colonize Mars.

27:08.762 --> 27:10.264
Oh, so you're going
to build some sort

27:10.297 --> 27:11.600
of settlement up there?

27:13.067 --> 27:13.868
No.

27:15.604 --> 27:18.272
There will be four people
in the first intake

27:19.406 --> 27:22.042
who will go to Mars permanently.

27:23.110 --> 27:25.012
Now, I've only been shortlisted.

27:25.045 --> 27:26.981
Well, why would
they want to do that?

27:28.215 --> 27:29.049
Not they Mom.

27:30.451 --> 27:31.452
It could be me.

27:36.056 --> 27:38.560
How long would you be away?

27:39.994 --> 27:41.896
Its a one way trip.

27:42.830 --> 27:43.931
I'm not coming back.

27:45.966 --> 27:47.935
But you're my only son.

27:47.968 --> 27:48.936
Mom.

27:48.969 --> 27:52.773
The first crew, they
won't leave until 2027.

27:52.806 --> 27:53.908
It's a long way away.

27:55.009 --> 27:56.744
Why cant somebody else go?

27:57.612 --> 27:59.346
Mom its a huge honor.

28:01.916 --> 28:03.317
But, you are my only son!

28:09.356 --> 28:11.258
MarsX will
launch a series of six

28:11.292 --> 28:13.761
rockets called DDV's.

28:13.794 --> 28:16.997
Deep Space Delivery
Vehicles over four years

28:17.031 --> 28:18.899
to deliver the
infrastructure our team

28:18.933 --> 28:21.001
will need when they arrive.

28:21.035 --> 28:24.438
The first rocket will be
launched in late 2019.

28:24.471 --> 28:26.473
- That's an old video.
- Shh.

28:26.508 --> 28:28.309
What makes
our mission different

28:28.342 --> 28:31.145
from the others is that
our colonizers will

28:31.178 --> 28:34.215
live on Mars and spend the
rest of their lives there.

28:35.049 --> 28:37.318
On arrival on the red planet,

28:37.351 --> 28:38.986
the astronauts
will initially live

28:39.019 --> 28:41.822
in an inflatable
Life Support Unit.

28:41.855 --> 28:44.358
They will assemble their
permanent living quarters

28:44.391 --> 28:47.361
then construct the
greenhouse, the laboratory,

28:47.394 --> 28:49.964
and then their
office and workspace.

28:49.997 --> 28:52.299
And this will only be the start.

28:52.333 --> 28:55.169
With over 150,000 applicants,

28:55.202 --> 28:58.540
MarsX has has now
narrowed the list to 200.

28:58.573 --> 29:02.042
From these 200 qualified
and enthusiastic candidates

29:02.076 --> 29:05.680
two men and two women
will be chosen to lead,

29:05.714 --> 29:07.682
in what will become the greatest

29:07.716 --> 29:10.217
scientific achievement
in human history.

29:33.608 --> 29:35.175
Don't!

29:35.209 --> 29:37.077
You're so annoying!

29:37.111 --> 29:38.412
Any mail today?

29:38.445 --> 29:39.714
Nothing for you.

29:39.748 --> 29:41.015
But, there's a letter
confirming Rachel's

29:41.048 --> 29:43.484
CT scan for 15th of April.

29:43.518 --> 29:45.486
The digital imaging
they use in the CT scan

29:45.520 --> 29:48.822
was developed by NASA for
the Apollo Lunar landings

29:48.856 --> 29:52.126
to computer analyze and
enhance photos of the Moon.

29:53.394 --> 29:54.495
How do you like that
slice of wisdom Nan?

29:55.730 --> 29:57.565
You can thank my
friend Kevin for that.

29:58.799 --> 30:01.101
He also said that
the earth is dying

30:01.135 --> 30:02.436
and that there's no
way it can support

30:02.469 --> 30:04.938
any life if we keep
polluting it the way we do.

30:06.541 --> 30:08.075
This whole going
to mars thing isn't

30:08.108 --> 30:10.277
going to help those
wallowing in poverty.

30:10.311 --> 30:12.246
Over a billion
people suffer from

30:12.279 --> 30:14.582
extreme poverty on this planet.

30:14.616 --> 30:16.350
How many millions
of children died

30:16.383 --> 30:18.520
just last year from poverty?

30:18.553 --> 30:22.056
So, doesn't it seem wrong
to you to spend billions

30:22.089 --> 30:24.592
of dollars on funding a
trip to Mars when people

30:24.626 --> 30:26.026
are dying from lack of food?

30:26.060 --> 30:28.929
Wow, so very erudite
from my baby sister.

30:28.962 --> 30:29.764
Shut up Max!

30:53.187 --> 30:56.123
Over 250 million years ago

30:56.156 --> 30:58.793
there was an event
which most people

30:58.827 --> 31:01.830
don't even know about,
called the Great Dying.

31:03.297 --> 31:06.967
It was the greatest mass
extinction in Earth's history.

31:08.168 --> 31:12.574
96% of marine life
was obliterated,

31:12.607 --> 31:17.612
and over 70% of all
animals were wiped out.

31:19.179 --> 31:21.014
It was called The
Permian Extinction.

31:22.149 --> 31:24.918
At some point in our evolution.

31:24.952 --> 31:27.789
we need to find
somewhere else to live

31:27.822 --> 31:31.024
or the human race will be
be wiped out altogether.

31:31.058 --> 31:33.628
That's exactly what
Kevin said to me today.

31:33.661 --> 31:37.832
Ultimately 100s of thousands
of people, maybe millions,

31:37.866 --> 31:40.167
will offer to live
on a new world,

31:41.902 --> 31:44.071
but someone needs to be first.

31:45.740 --> 31:47.809
Someone needs to
make that sacrifice

31:49.076 --> 31:52.146
and it would be so
much easier for me

31:52.179 --> 31:55.482
if I could go knowing
that I have your support.

31:57.217 --> 31:58.720
You have mine Dad.

31:58.753 --> 32:00.187
110%.

32:01.321 --> 32:03.323
And what about support for me?

32:03.357 --> 32:05.527
And your responsibilities
for your children?

32:05.560 --> 32:08.830
You will be well
looked after financially.

32:08.863 --> 32:13.868
If I am chosen and if I
get on the first flight.

32:14.702 --> 32:18.338
Rachel will be 27 and Max 30.

32:18.372 --> 32:21.241
All grown up and hardly
likely to be living here.

32:21.275 --> 32:22.911
When Dad came out from England

32:22.943 --> 32:24.846
when he was 23,
what did he have?

32:25.680 --> 32:27.549
11 pounds and five shillings.

32:27.582 --> 32:29.183
And no return ticket.

32:29.216 --> 32:32.720
And my mother bawled
her eyes out at the dock.

32:32.754 --> 32:35.055
And he wasn't
married, you are.

32:36.356 --> 32:39.326
It's not as if I'm going
to be out of your life.

32:39.359 --> 32:41.361
I'll have unlimited
access to email

32:41.395 --> 32:43.363
and other communications.

32:43.397 --> 32:45.733
And as I said earlier,
I reckon there's a

32:45.767 --> 32:47.936
reasonably good chance
that we'll get back.

32:49.136 --> 32:50.572
NASA'll send a team a
few years after ours

32:50.605 --> 32:52.607
and they're bringing
their team back.

32:52.640 --> 32:55.242
Well, why don't you
go with NASA dear?

32:55.275 --> 32:57.211
NASA haven't
offered me a trip,

32:57.244 --> 33:00.180
but I reckon we could hitch
a ride back with them.

33:00.214 --> 33:01.348
Hang on.

33:01.381 --> 33:03.217
Are MarsX saying that or you?

33:03.250 --> 33:04.719
Me.

33:04.752 --> 33:06.487
But it doesn't sound
too impossible?

33:09.724 --> 33:13.360
If the human race is going to
survive for another 5000 years

33:13.393 --> 33:15.530
we will need to
colonize other planets.

33:15.563 --> 33:17.030
It's that simple!

33:17.064 --> 33:18.933
And if I get the
chance to be one

33:18.967 --> 33:21.468
of the first settlers on Mars,

33:21.503 --> 33:22.670
I'd like to take it.

33:25.305 --> 33:26.941
And where do I fit into this?

33:28.242 --> 33:31.144
You will be part of it
as my wife here on earth.

33:31.980 --> 33:33.347
And what does that mean?

33:34.616 --> 33:37.317
Every move made
by the team on Mars

33:37.351 --> 33:39.052
will be televised live

33:39.086 --> 33:42.790
and relayed on earth via a 20
minute delay here on earth.

33:42.824 --> 33:46.360
They reckon it will be the
biggest TV audience ever.

33:47.261 --> 33:49.329
You will be part of that.

33:49.363 --> 33:52.634
As will all the family
members of the astronauts.

33:52.667 --> 33:53.935
Really?

33:53.968 --> 33:56.671
And who asked me
if I wanted that?

33:56.704 --> 34:00.274
When we first met you
would have given anything

34:00.307 --> 34:01.543
for a piece of fame.

34:03.011 --> 34:06.179
I wanted to be an
actress, not a Mars widow.

34:06.213 --> 34:09.650
If I'm chosen and get to be
on one of the first flights,

34:09.684 --> 34:12.887
you will have more exposure
than Jenifer Aniston ever had.

34:14.621 --> 34:16.724
And if I say I don't
want that exposure?

34:18.225 --> 34:19.458
They can't make you.

34:22.996 --> 34:24.565
Isn't this thought provoking?

34:26.400 --> 34:28.368
I mean, we all know its unlikely

34:28.402 --> 34:30.505
that I'll be selected but,

34:30.538 --> 34:32.371
the fact we're
talking about this,

34:32.406 --> 34:34.809
I mean, this, this is fun.

34:48.221 --> 34:50.891
Nick,
can you get that?

34:56.396 --> 34:57.397
Hi.

34:57.431 --> 34:58.398
Hi.

34:58.432 --> 34:59.701
Are you Nicholas Wilkinson?

34:59.734 --> 35:02.302
I am, but I'm not
buying anything thank you.

35:02.336 --> 35:03.705
I'm Amanda Williams.

35:07.341 --> 35:08.342
What do you want?

35:08.375 --> 35:10.011
Do you know that woman?

35:12.880 --> 35:14.147
What do you want?

35:14.181 --> 35:15.382
She's my mother,

35:15.415 --> 35:17.117
and I believe the person
she is with is you.

35:21.355 --> 35:23.290
Can we go somewhere
else to talk?

35:26.094 --> 35:27.528
Laura, I'm going for a run.

35:27.562 --> 35:28.630
I'll be back soon.

35:44.378 --> 35:46.246
How did you find me?

35:46.279 --> 35:47.582
I paid a private investigator.

35:49.050 --> 35:49.817
Ah.

35:52.152 --> 35:53.420
Where are we going?

35:54.488 --> 35:55.790
Anywhere.

35:55.823 --> 35:58.059
I just don't think we
should be at my home.

35:59.493 --> 36:01.461
Why didn't you
answer my emails,

36:01.495 --> 36:03.463
or my phone calls
for that matter?

36:03.497 --> 36:05.432
My life is rather complicated.

36:12.305 --> 36:13.875
You know what,

36:13.908 --> 36:14.942
lets go for a walk.

36:18.579 --> 36:20.280
C'mon, it's a bit more private.

36:46.808 --> 36:47.809
When I was going
through her papers,

36:47.842 --> 36:49.177
I came across that photo.

36:50.511 --> 36:51.913
I asked my Dad who it was

36:51.946 --> 36:53.881
and that's when he told me
he wasn't my real father.

36:55.116 --> 36:56.984
Imagine believing
a lie for 25 years.

37:00.855 --> 37:02.489
Did you have a
relationship with an

37:02.523 --> 37:04.025
Evelyn Davis 25 years ago?

37:08.495 --> 37:11.632
That photo was taken
before her grad school ball.

37:13.534 --> 37:14.902
We were utterly inseparable.

37:17.304 --> 37:19.607
We met at an astronomical
society Christmas party

37:19.640 --> 37:21.042
just a few months before.

37:22.877 --> 37:24.612
Her brother brought her along

37:24.645 --> 37:26.379
and we hit it off straight away.

37:28.850 --> 37:30.852
Problem for us was
she was only 17

37:32.754 --> 37:35.422
and we were spending a
great deal of time together.

37:37.525 --> 37:40.393
Her parents thought that
we were getting too serious

37:40.427 --> 37:41.662
and I was too old for her,

37:43.497 --> 37:44.532
so they split us up.

37:46.534 --> 37:49.036
Sent her off to live with
an aunt in Hawkes Bay,

37:50.238 --> 37:51.839
and I never heard
from her again.

37:54.842 --> 37:56.544
Did you sleep with my mother?

38:03.117 --> 38:04.685
I tried to track her down.

38:06.353 --> 38:08.723
I even went to Hawkes Bay
but I couldn't find her.

38:10.625 --> 38:11.424
I was shattered.

38:17.965 --> 38:20.668
I was born in September 1993.

38:20.701 --> 38:22.136
I'm 25-years-old.

38:25.940 --> 38:27.909
Are you prepared
to get a DNA test?

38:37.552 --> 38:39.754
I don't think I need to.

38:45.492 --> 38:46.426
Let's go back.

40:57.758 --> 40:59.060
Mom.

40:59.093 --> 41:01.762
I've got to go
sorry, Tamara's here.

41:01.796 --> 41:02.863
Love you.

41:04.532 --> 41:05.299
- Hey!
- Hi.

41:08.803 --> 41:10.237
Sharna can't make it,

41:10.271 --> 41:11.839
so you've got me
on my own today.

41:11.872 --> 41:12.907
That's okay.

41:13.574 --> 41:14.875
Hey, how're you
going with all the

41:14.909 --> 41:16.777
publicity Nick's been getting?

41:16.811 --> 41:17.745
Ugh.

41:17.778 --> 41:19.580
Are you all
ready to order now?

41:19.613 --> 41:21.015
Can I get a cappuccino please.

41:21.048 --> 41:22.183
And a flat white.

41:22.216 --> 41:22.950
Anything to eat?

41:22.984 --> 41:23.751
No thanks.

41:23.784 --> 41:24.819
Not for me.

41:25.786 --> 41:28.589
Hey, Jim asked me what
I wanted for my 40th

41:28.622 --> 41:30.024
and I said a trip to Thailand.

41:30.057 --> 41:31.792
So then he wanted to
know what he'd be up for

41:31.826 --> 41:32.893
for my 50th and my 60th.

41:32.927 --> 41:35.429
And I said "I didn't
know about my 50th,

41:35.463 --> 41:38.299
"but for my 60th he could
come and pick me up."

41:39.633 --> 41:40.568
Nice one.

41:41.802 --> 41:43.938
You know, you are really
the talk of the town.

41:43.971 --> 41:46.440
Everyone is on about you,
Nick and the Mars thing.

41:46.474 --> 41:47.808
What are they saying?

41:47.842 --> 41:49.477
Don't worry about
what people are saying.

41:49.510 --> 41:52.380
I think you are amazing
for letting Nick do this.

41:52.413 --> 41:54.782
I mean, I could never
let Jim do that.

41:54.815 --> 41:56.283
How many wives would
let their husbands

41:56.317 --> 41:57.785
go on a one way trip to Mars?

41:57.818 --> 41:59.220
I didn't.

41:59.253 --> 42:01.756
He didn't even tell
me he was applying.

42:01.789 --> 42:02.823
Oh my gosh!

42:03.791 --> 42:04.959
What?

42:04.992 --> 42:06.627
Sorry to interrupt,
but are you the

42:06.660 --> 42:07.962
wife of Nick Wilkinson?

42:08.963 --> 42:09.764
Yes.

42:10.965 --> 42:12.800
Can I say, you are remarkable

42:12.833 --> 42:16.737
to allow your husband to
desert you and your family.

42:16.771 --> 42:18.339
Shame I can't say the same about

42:18.372 --> 42:20.741
your selfish cad of a husband.

42:20.775 --> 42:23.444
Okay, well lets go.

42:23.477 --> 42:25.413
Perhaps we can sit over here.

42:25.446 --> 42:26.947
Apologies for my wife.

42:26.981 --> 42:28.816
I think your husband's
got real guts.

42:34.855 --> 42:39.860
Thank you.

42:42.897 --> 42:44.198
Are you okay?

42:47.201 --> 42:48.002
I'm fine.

42:51.872 --> 42:55.042
I've got a bad vibe that this
is a sign of things to come.

42:55.076 --> 42:56.610
I already had two people stop me

42:56.644 --> 42:59.313
today at the supermarket
on my way here,

42:59.346 --> 43:00.881
at least they were supportive.

43:03.818 --> 43:04.685
Well you still haven't told me

43:04.718 --> 43:05.820
what the others were saying?

43:08.557 --> 43:09.723
Sharna doesn't say much.

43:09.757 --> 43:11.792
You know what she's like.

43:11.826 --> 43:13.294
And Kate reckons she
can't get her head around

43:13.327 --> 43:14.929
why anyone would
even want to go.

43:16.931 --> 43:18.232
And Jemma thinks
Nick's a bastard

43:18.265 --> 43:19.867
for leaving you and the kids,

43:19.900 --> 43:22.837
but she never says anything
nice about anyone anyway.

43:30.711 --> 43:32.880
Max can you give
me a hand please?

43:39.787 --> 43:41.556
Max, get here now!

43:46.727 --> 43:47.761
Shit!

43:47.795 --> 43:49.897
Shit shit, shit!

43:49.930 --> 43:52.501
For Christ's sake why don't
you come when I call you?

43:52.534 --> 43:53.834
If you came the first
time we wouldn't

43:53.868 --> 43:55.970
have this stuff all
over the damn floor!

44:13.721 --> 44:14.488
Oh shit!

44:15.956 --> 44:18.392
These bloody bags!

44:18.425 --> 44:21.195
Bloody supermarket!

44:21.228 --> 44:22.830
Stupid everything!

44:35.676 --> 44:37.077
With
Robert and Jeanette.

44:37.111 --> 44:38.312
I feel like we're about to have

44:38.345 --> 44:39.446
a really awkward conversation.

44:39.480 --> 44:40.814
No, it's
doesn't need to be awkward.

44:40.848 --> 44:42.416
'Cause
you see, if something

44:42.449 --> 44:43.317
doesn't sit right with her,

44:43.350 --> 44:44.018
you won't reject me.

44:44.852 --> 44:46.420
You
haven't don't anything wrong.

44:46.453 --> 44:47.788
Strangely though, it's
not you this time.

44:47.821 --> 44:48.989
So we've had this crunchy salted

44:49.023 --> 44:50.559
caramel biscuits in the studio

44:50.592 --> 44:51.825
for the last couple of days,

44:51.859 --> 44:53.928
and the reason I am
bringing this up now,

44:53.961 --> 44:55.262
I am a fake, I am a fraud.

44:55.296 --> 44:56.163
What happened?

44:56.197 --> 44:57.998
They were out of a packet!

44:58.032 --> 44:59.668
- I
- wanted to come clean.

44:59.700 --> 45:01.101
You
could've just gone

45:01.135 --> 45:02.736
- I'll take it.
- Yes I know, I know.

45:02.770 --> 45:04.506
But
it wasn't sitting right.

45:08.342 --> 45:09.678
Hey Zeke, what's up?

45:12.614 --> 45:13.480
Okay, yeah yeah.

45:13.515 --> 45:15.316
I'll ask, gimme a sec.

45:15.349 --> 45:16.685
Hey Dad, Zeke wants
me to go around to

45:16.717 --> 45:18.687
his place after school
today, is that okay?

45:18.719 --> 45:20.287
That's fine as long as
you're home for dinner

45:20.321 --> 45:21.956
and make time for your homework.

45:21.989 --> 45:23.023
Thanks Dad.

45:23.958 --> 45:25.292
Hey Zeke, all good
here so I'll meet you

45:25.326 --> 45:27.027
at the gate after school, yeah?

45:27.962 --> 45:29.029
Okay yeah.

45:29.997 --> 45:30.931
Zeke, see you then.

45:37.338 --> 45:38.939
Zeke didn't want anything
to do with me before,

45:38.973 --> 45:40.508
but now he wants
to be my friend.

45:53.053 --> 45:55.956
Oh, Mom you don't
need to do the dishes.

45:55.990 --> 45:57.124
But you're sick.

45:57.157 --> 45:58.492
I'm not sick really.

45:58.526 --> 45:59.426
I just couldn't face work

45:59.460 --> 46:01.428
with everything that's going on.

46:01.462 --> 46:02.863
It's driving me crazy.

46:04.131 --> 46:07.334
How are the kids taking it?

46:07.368 --> 46:09.103
Max seems okay.

46:09.136 --> 46:11.438
Rachel is not taking
it well at all.

46:11.472 --> 46:13.874
She's bottling it up
and not saying much.

46:13.907 --> 46:16.410
I can tell shes not
got a good head space.

46:20.749 --> 46:22.216
I'm scared.

46:22.249 --> 46:24.985
Really scared about what's
happening to this family.

46:26.353 --> 46:28.155
Are you going to
accept Nick going off

46:28.188 --> 46:30.057
like that without a fight?

46:30.090 --> 46:31.492
What would you
have done if Dad told

46:31.526 --> 46:33.628
you he was going off to the
Moon and never coming back.

46:33.662 --> 46:35.396
I would have said
"No you're not!"

46:42.737 --> 46:44.539
I just had to get
those emails off.

46:45.740 --> 46:47.274
It's the second one
today from MarsX.

46:49.611 --> 46:52.379
This is crap about you
catching a ride back with NASA.

46:53.615 --> 46:55.816
"Scientists from the
US space agency say

46:55.849 --> 46:58.419
"say that if you've been
on Mars for 10 years

46:58.452 --> 46:59.721
"then you wont be
able to come back

46:59.754 --> 47:01.188
"because your bones
will be too brittle."

47:01.221 --> 47:04.024
Yes and they are currently
working on solutions

47:04.058 --> 47:06.327
that will solve
that very problem.

47:06.360 --> 47:08.663
It also says on the same site,

47:08.697 --> 47:09.997
"Why do people
want to go to Mars?

47:10.030 --> 47:13.100
"For many enthusiasts
it is an escape,

47:13.133 --> 47:16.136
"a chance for a new start and
the challenge of a lifetime."

47:17.237 --> 47:18.740
Is that what this is about?

47:18.773 --> 47:19.873
You want a new start?

47:20.709 --> 47:21.842
Have I not been a good wife?

47:21.875 --> 47:23.678
Of course you have,

47:23.712 --> 47:24.945
and I love you
heaps, it's just...

47:24.978 --> 47:27.047
Is it for the glory of it?

47:27.081 --> 47:29.416
No, this is not about me.

47:29.450 --> 47:31.251
This is about a mission
that the people of

47:31.285 --> 47:33.788
this world need if
it's going to survive.

47:33.822 --> 47:35.389
Well, if it's the
mission that's important,

47:35.422 --> 47:37.191
then why can't you
let some unattached

47:37.224 --> 47:38.926
person take your place?

47:38.959 --> 47:41.028
Darling, do you
realize that the first

47:41.061 --> 47:43.030
four people to set foot on Mars

47:43.063 --> 47:45.432
will be immortalized in history?

47:45.466 --> 47:47.201
I mean, this is bigger than big!

47:47.234 --> 47:50.070
This is absolutely
history in the making!

47:50.104 --> 47:50.971
History.

47:51.004 --> 47:52.406
Well, I will make history.

47:52.439 --> 47:53.941
I'm giving you an ultimatum!

47:55.142 --> 47:56.745
Either you withdraw from
the selection process

47:56.778 --> 47:58.278
or you can find a
new place to live!

47:58.312 --> 47:59.246
You're not serious.

47:59.279 --> 48:00.548
I'm deadly serious.

48:00.582 --> 48:03.150
You have got 48 hours
to send that email.

48:03.183 --> 48:05.486
And in the meantime you can
sleep in the spare room.

48:05.520 --> 48:06.821
Why?

48:06.855 --> 48:08.255
Because I want to
make a difference?

48:08.288 --> 48:10.257
Y'know we cannot keep
over populating...

48:10.290 --> 48:11.291
Do you know what?

48:11.325 --> 48:12.926
I don't want to talk
about this right now!

48:12.960 --> 48:15.295
In fact I don't want to
talk about it ever again!

48:15.329 --> 48:16.865
You've got 48 hours!

48:37.284 --> 48:38.318
Mr. Wilkinson.

48:39.353 --> 48:40.120
Paul Chamberlain.

48:40.154 --> 48:41.188
Hi.

48:41.221 --> 48:42.022
Nice to meet you

48:43.190 --> 48:44.124
Please, sit down.

48:52.332 --> 48:54.134
Forgive me if I'm
a bit disheveled,

48:54.168 --> 48:55.369
it's been a hell of a week.

48:57.337 --> 48:58.706
Before we start,

48:58.740 --> 49:00.274
I need to know that
nothing I say here

49:00.307 --> 49:02.009
will go beyond these four walls.

49:03.143 --> 49:05.145
What I have to say
is very confidential.

49:06.413 --> 49:08.182
Mr. Wilkinson
your medical records

49:08.215 --> 49:10.184
and information are protected by

49:10.217 --> 49:12.052
doctor-patient confidentiality.

49:12.085 --> 49:14.188
I know, but I want
your assurance that

49:14.221 --> 49:16.223
my records are not
available to staff

49:16.256 --> 49:18.726
or anyone else for that matter.

49:18.760 --> 49:20.829
In the medical profession
we are all subject

49:20.862 --> 49:23.297
to a duty of confidentiality.

49:23.330 --> 49:25.265
Rest assured confidential
is just that.

49:26.935 --> 49:28.402
Thank you.

49:28.435 --> 49:29.637
How may I help
you Mr. Wilkinson?

49:29.671 --> 49:31.071
Ah, call me Nick.

49:33.106 --> 49:35.877
Well, I've been
having some nightmares

49:35.910 --> 49:36.845
to put it mildly.

49:38.278 --> 49:41.048
I'm going through a very awkward
situation with my family.

49:42.917 --> 49:45.052
Did you see the
Herald on Monday?

49:45.085 --> 49:46.721
No, I
don't think I did.

49:49.389 --> 49:51.759
About nine months a go
I applied for a position

49:51.793 --> 49:54.194
as an astronaut to go on
the first trip to Mars.

49:58.232 --> 50:01.903
It's really important that
this meeting be confidential.

50:01.936 --> 50:04.539
Because if word got
out that I was here,

50:06.073 --> 50:08.408
well my chances as one of
the first to fly to Mars

50:08.442 --> 50:09.811
would be gone in a flash.

50:11.713 --> 50:13.615
Well, I didn't hear
anything for months

50:14.448 --> 50:16.049
and to cut a long story short.

50:16.083 --> 50:18.686
Just last week I received
an official letter

50:18.720 --> 50:20.755
telling me that I've
been shortlisted

50:20.788 --> 50:22.924
as one of 100 candidates chosen

50:22.957 --> 50:25.793
to train for the
positions available.

50:30.097 --> 50:33.835
The problem is that my family,

50:35.435 --> 50:36.738
well I hadn't told them.

50:38.305 --> 50:40.975
And to say they're very upset
would be an understatement.

50:43.477 --> 50:45.178
So let me get this right.

50:47.281 --> 50:50.250
You saw an advertisement
for a trip to Mars online

50:50.284 --> 50:52.587
you applied, you were accepted.

50:53.420 --> 50:54.656
Your family is
upset so why didn't

50:54.689 --> 50:56.423
you offer to take them too?

51:05.667 --> 51:09.436
You know what, I think
I am wasting my time here.

51:09.469 --> 51:10.939
Please sit down Mr. Wilkinson.

51:10.972 --> 51:12.239
Why would I sit down?

51:12.272 --> 51:13.908
You obviously don't believe
a word that I've said.

51:13.942 --> 51:15.175
You must admit it...

51:17.110 --> 51:18.846
Why don't you tell
me a little more

51:18.880 --> 51:20.280
of whats happening in your life?

51:20.314 --> 51:21.348
Please, sit down.

51:21.381 --> 51:23.283
Here is my letter from MarsX

51:23.317 --> 51:25.019
telling me I've
been short listed.

51:32.961 --> 51:34.361
I am terribly sorry.

51:37.464 --> 51:39.466
I wondered if you
were delusional.

51:41.002 --> 51:43.638
And just in case we're
still not on the same page

51:43.671 --> 51:46.273
this is not a trip to
Mars as in a holiday.

51:46.306 --> 51:49.043
This is four people
in the first instance

51:49.077 --> 51:51.045
going to colonize Mars.

51:52.312 --> 51:55.016
And you were chosen
out of how many people?

51:55.049 --> 51:57.184
200,000 from all
over the world.

51:57.217 --> 51:58.519
That is amazing!

51:59.721 --> 52:01.022
A huge honor for you.

52:01.055 --> 52:02.356
A huge honor for our country.

52:03.390 --> 52:04.424
Thank you.

52:06.995 --> 52:08.295
The problem is that none of the

52:08.328 --> 52:10.330
early colonists
will be coming back.

52:13.101 --> 52:15.036
Now you're kidding me, right?

52:15.069 --> 52:16.370
No.

52:16.403 --> 52:18.640
And my family are
taking it badly.

52:18.673 --> 52:20.008
Well do you blame them?

52:21.208 --> 52:23.511
Sorry, I shouldn't
have said that.

52:23.544 --> 52:26.080
When you say that
you're not coming back,

52:26.114 --> 52:27.749
do you mean not ever?

52:28.850 --> 52:29.751
Not ever.

52:41.194 --> 52:42.797
Your 48 hours is up!

52:45.533 --> 52:47.935
It's one o'clock for God sake.

52:47.969 --> 52:50.170
Well I cant sleep.

52:50.203 --> 52:51.438
And you obviously don't love me

52:51.471 --> 52:54.408
or you wouldn't be
leaving me and our family.

52:54.441 --> 52:55.610
And I've thought about this

52:55.643 --> 52:57.545
and I don't want to live with
somebody who doesn't love me.

52:57.578 --> 53:00.347
Can we talk about
this in the morning?

53:00.380 --> 53:02.583
In the morning, you'll
be packing your bags!

53:02.617 --> 53:03.618
Good night!

53:03.651 --> 53:04.952
Laura!

54:06.948 --> 54:08.348
When's your school play?

54:09.217 --> 54:10.017
I pulled out.

54:11.119 --> 54:12.954
When did you do that?

54:12.987 --> 54:14.454
A couple of days ago.

54:14.488 --> 54:15.255
Why?

54:15.288 --> 54:16.456
You told me you
were loving being...

54:16.490 --> 54:17.525
Don't ask me why,

54:17.558 --> 54:19.493
I just don't want to
do it anymore, okay.

54:24.065 --> 54:26.033
I hope you've packed your bag.

54:26.067 --> 54:26.868
Mom!

55:31.899 --> 55:33.433
Oh come on!

55:37.572 --> 55:39.073
Laura, the door is locked!

55:39.106 --> 55:40.473
Let me in please!

55:45.213 --> 55:46.747
Laura!

55:46.781 --> 55:48.481
Will you let me in please?

55:52.954 --> 55:54.755
Rachel, Max!

55:56.891 --> 55:58.726
Can you open the door please?

56:09.270 --> 56:10.104
Hi ya.

56:12.073 --> 56:13.875
Pete's sister is coming
over at the weekend

56:13.908 --> 56:15.943
and she's supposed to
be staying in here,

56:16.811 --> 56:18.145
so I hope you've got your shit

56:18.179 --> 56:20.548
sorted out with Laura by then.

56:20.581 --> 56:22.216
God, so do I.

56:22.250 --> 56:24.151
And in case you are wondering,

56:24.185 --> 56:26.153
I don't blame her.

56:26.187 --> 56:27.822
So you can sleep on that!

57:55.343 --> 57:56.110
Mike?

57:58.245 --> 57:59.647
Can you come across
to the greenhouse?

57:59.680 --> 58:00.715
I've had an accident.

58:00.748 --> 58:01.949
Nick?

58:02.883 --> 58:03.684
Nick.

58:05.052 --> 58:06.320
- Can you hear me?
- Nick, communications

58:06.354 --> 58:07.088
Breaking down.

58:07.121 --> 58:08.823
Can you hear us?

58:08.856 --> 58:09.857
Philippe are you there?

58:09.890 --> 58:11.726
Can you hear us?

58:11.759 --> 58:12.793
Akiko?

58:18.399 --> 58:19.900
Hey guys.

58:19.934 --> 58:20.901
I need some help.

58:20.935 --> 58:23.337
Nick are you there?

58:23.371 --> 58:24.605
Can you hear us?

58:24.638 --> 58:25.873
I cant breathe.

58:25.906 --> 58:27.608
Can you pull
back on the vault?

58:27.641 --> 58:28.509
Philippe!

58:28.542 --> 58:29.577
Nick,
you're breaking up.

58:29.610 --> 58:30.711
We can't hear you.

58:30.745 --> 58:32.013
Somebody help me!

58:32.046 --> 58:33.781
Nick?

59:23.964 --> 59:25.833
It's 1:30 in the morning.

59:25.866 --> 59:28.135
Rachel is missing,
I can't find her anywhere.

59:28.169 --> 59:29.403
She's not in her room.

59:29.437 --> 59:31.205
What do you mean
she's not in her room?

59:31.238 --> 59:32.807
I got up
to go to the bathroom

59:32.840 --> 59:34.108
and something made
me check on Rachel.

59:34.141 --> 59:35.342
She's not in her room.

59:36.545 --> 59:37.578
Dad, I've
checked the bathroom

59:37.611 --> 59:38.913
and every room in the house.

59:38.946 --> 59:40.281
Shes not here, you
need to come home.

59:45.219 --> 59:46.020
Rachel!

59:56.797 --> 59:57.566
Rachel!

59:59.667 --> 01:00:00.468
Rachel!

01:00:02.903 --> 01:00:03.971
Rachel!

01:00:08.543 --> 01:00:09.343
Rachel!

01:00:13.481 --> 01:00:14.248
Rachel!

01:00:15.850 --> 01:00:18.352
We can't wake up the
whole neighborhood.

01:00:21.989 --> 01:00:22.857
One,
one, one, Emergency.

01:00:22.890 --> 01:00:24.859
Fire, Ambulance, or Police?

01:00:24.892 --> 01:00:25.826
Police.

01:00:25.860 --> 01:00:27.061
This is the police.

01:00:27.094 --> 01:00:28.662
Where is the location
of the emergency?

01:00:28.696 --> 01:00:30.231
440 Pearson Drive, Glenwood.

01:00:31.732 --> 01:00:33.467
What is the
nature of your emergency?

01:00:33.502 --> 01:00:35.069
My daughter is missing.

01:00:35.102 --> 01:00:38.573
The route slider her room
is open and she's missing.

01:00:38.607 --> 01:00:40.609
Okay, tell
me what you know.

01:00:42.176 --> 01:00:45.412
She went to bed around 9:30.

01:00:45.446 --> 01:00:48.215
Said she was tired and that's
the last we saw of her.

01:00:48.249 --> 01:00:49.984
My wife has a habit of
checking on the kids

01:00:50.017 --> 01:00:52.219
if she wakes in the
middle of the night.

01:00:52.253 --> 01:00:53.555
Did you or your wife

01:00:53.588 --> 01:00:56.757
have an argument
with her tonight?

01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:58.058
No, we did not.

01:01:02.296 --> 01:01:04.031
She said that we have to
lodge a missing person

01:01:04.064 --> 01:01:05.699
at the police station.

01:01:06.901 --> 01:01:09.904
We need to provide a photograph,

01:01:09.937 --> 01:01:12.873
you need to make a list of all
her friends and associates.

01:01:12.907 --> 01:01:14.742
They want to know her
bank account number,

01:01:14.775 --> 01:01:16.744
phone number, emails,

01:01:16.777 --> 01:01:19.581
social network sites,
and she recommends

01:01:19.614 --> 01:01:22.883
that we don't even
start until the morning.

01:01:22.917 --> 01:01:24.418
Apparently they
get lots of teenage

01:01:24.451 --> 01:01:26.053
girls go missing overnight.

01:01:59.119 --> 01:01:59.887
Hello.

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:00.921
Hi my name's Megan.

01:02:00.955 --> 01:02:02.389
I'm so sorry to ring
you in the middle

01:02:02.423 --> 01:02:03.558
of the night like this,

01:02:03.592 --> 01:02:05.125
but I have your
daughter Rachel with me

01:02:05.159 --> 01:02:07.328
and I think you need
to come and get her.

01:02:33.854 --> 01:02:36.591
I think your daughter
has drunk too much.

01:02:36.625 --> 01:02:38.025
Thank you
for calling us.

01:02:38.058 --> 01:02:38.959
It's alright

01:02:38.993 --> 01:02:41.295
She didn't want me to call you!

01:02:41.328 --> 01:02:42.997
But the Manager had
asked her to leave

01:02:43.030 --> 01:02:44.131
and she was asking around

01:02:44.164 --> 01:02:46.133
where she could
stay for the night.

01:02:47.702 --> 01:02:49.036
Are you two friends?

01:02:49.069 --> 01:02:51.706
No, we met on the
dance floor tonight.

01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:54.308
She was really crunked up.

01:02:54.341 --> 01:02:57.778
And about an hour ago
started acting really crazy.

01:02:57.811 --> 01:03:00.948
I guess the bourbon
eventually got to her.

01:03:00.981 --> 01:03:02.517
Thank you again
for ringing us.

01:03:02.550 --> 01:03:04.218
They are usually
really strict about

01:03:04.251 --> 01:03:06.020
18 plus beautiful lady.

01:03:07.021 --> 01:03:08.556
Her mother and I
were worried sick.

01:03:09.758 --> 01:03:10.991
Can we give you
a lift somewhere?

01:03:11.025 --> 01:03:12.826
No, thanks.

01:03:12.860 --> 01:03:13.728
Bye.

01:03:13.762 --> 01:03:14.529
Bye!

01:03:14.562 --> 01:03:15.764
Bye!

01:04:05.814 --> 01:04:08.550
You can't call
anyone, it's four a.m.

01:04:10.552 --> 01:04:12.052
What's happening Rachel,

01:04:12.086 --> 01:04:13.722
you have never done
anything like this before?

01:04:16.223 --> 01:04:18.793
You had your Mom
absolutely petrified.

01:04:18.827 --> 01:04:20.762
What about you,
did you even care?

01:04:22.229 --> 01:04:23.097
Rachel, you know I care.

01:04:23.130 --> 01:04:24.398
Why would you say that?

01:04:24.431 --> 01:04:26.934
Why would you care,
you're leaving remember,

01:04:26.967 --> 01:04:28.969
and I'll never see you again.

01:04:29.002 --> 01:04:31.872
I haven't even got the
selection, I'm only shortlisted.

01:04:31.905 --> 01:04:33.207
Yeah well you
might get selected

01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:36.076
and you don't care if
you break this family up.

01:04:36.110 --> 01:04:36.977
I feel sick.

01:04:37.010 --> 01:04:38.145
That's not true!

01:04:38.178 --> 01:04:39.213
No I mean I feel sick.

01:04:39.246 --> 01:04:40.280
Can you stop the car?

01:05:04.271 --> 01:05:06.907
I mean it's not
true that I don't

01:05:06.940 --> 01:05:08.676
care about breaking
up this family.

01:05:08.710 --> 01:05:11.912
You're all the most important
people in the world to me.

01:05:11.945 --> 01:05:14.783
So why are you leaving
the people you say you love?

01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:18.520
I know it's hard
to understand,

01:05:18.553 --> 01:05:21.955
but this is a chance for
me to do something that can

01:05:21.989 --> 01:05:24.024
improve the lives of
everyone on this planet.

01:05:24.057 --> 01:05:26.093
It's not hard to understand!

01:05:26.126 --> 01:05:28.295
You are leaving us, your family,

01:05:28.328 --> 01:05:29.329
to live on another planet

01:05:29.363 --> 01:05:31.800
and never see me or
Mom or Max again.

01:05:31.833 --> 01:05:35.302
That's not true, I'll
have access to the internet.

01:05:35.335 --> 01:05:37.304
We can catch up on what
you're doing every day

01:05:37.337 --> 01:05:38.305
if we both have time.

01:05:38.338 --> 01:05:39.607
You can't even Skype!

01:05:39.641 --> 01:05:41.643
There's a 20 minute delay.

01:05:41.676 --> 01:05:43.878
I looked it up on
the MarsX website.

01:06:04.364 --> 01:06:06.768
You gave us quite a scare.

01:06:55.215 --> 01:06:57.685
How long are you gonna
make Dad stay away for?

01:06:57.719 --> 01:07:00.020
Until he comes to his senses.

01:07:00.053 --> 01:07:02.289
Dad's not a 17-year-old,

01:07:02.322 --> 01:07:03.925
he needs to grow up.

01:07:05.492 --> 01:07:06.794
C'mon.

01:07:06.828 --> 01:07:08.763
You'll miss your bus,
you better get going.

01:07:11.064 --> 01:07:13.433
I'm gonna miss our chats
in the morning in the car.

01:07:14.636 --> 01:07:16.938
Well, you better
get used to it.

01:07:38.593 --> 01:07:40.227
Well, well well,
you haven't returned

01:07:40.260 --> 01:07:42.396
any of my calls in three days.

01:07:42.429 --> 01:07:43.631
Rachel's
results have come through

01:07:43.665 --> 01:07:45.667
and the news isn't good.

01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:47.635
The tests came back
from radiology yesterday

01:07:47.669 --> 01:07:50.337
and it's Hodgkin lymphoma.

01:07:50.370 --> 01:07:52.306
What's Hodgkin lymphoma?

01:07:52.339 --> 01:07:54.174
Its a type
of blood cancer.

01:07:56.476 --> 01:07:57.477
Nick?

01:07:57.512 --> 01:07:59.047
Yeah.

01:07:59.079 --> 01:08:00.247
The test
came through last night

01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:01.415
and the doctor
called after dinner

01:08:01.448 --> 01:08:02.684
and asked us to go in today.

01:08:04.351 --> 01:08:05.653
This is terrible.

01:08:05.687 --> 01:08:08.623
They want her to start
chemo within the fortnight.

01:08:08.656 --> 01:08:10.457
Oh my God, Rachel.

01:08:10.490 --> 01:08:12.827
She's only 14 why...

01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:14.461
She seemed fine the other day

01:08:14.494 --> 01:08:16.496
apart from complaining about
that lump under her arm.

01:08:16.531 --> 01:08:18.165
Well she's not fine

01:08:18.198 --> 01:08:21.134
and this treatment is going to
hit her like a ton of bricks.

01:08:21.167 --> 01:08:22.435
Why didn't you tell me?

01:08:22.469 --> 01:08:24.606
I would have taken time
off and gone with you.

01:08:24.639 --> 01:08:26.439
We didn't know.

01:08:26.473 --> 01:08:27.975
I should have guessed when
the Doctor rang last night

01:08:28.009 --> 01:08:29.475
but my mind was somewhere else.

01:08:30.845 --> 01:08:32.013
Chemo?

01:08:32.046 --> 01:08:33.412
She's terrified!

01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.823
Emails.

01:08:42.857 --> 01:08:45.325
There are no new emails.

01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:46.961
Yesterday.

01:08:46.995 --> 01:08:49.997
There were no emails
from Laura yesterday.

01:08:50.031 --> 01:08:51.398
Two days ago.

01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:54.669
There were no emails
from Laura two days ago.

01:08:54.702 --> 01:08:56.236
Three days ago.

01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:59.473
There were no emails from
Laura three days ago.

01:08:59.506 --> 01:09:00.508
Sent emails.

01:09:06.514 --> 01:09:07.447
Sent to Laura.

01:11:20.681 --> 01:11:22.216
I'm doing this for Rachel,

01:11:22.250 --> 01:11:24.185
but you are sleeping
in the spare room.

01:11:25.686 --> 01:11:28.222
I thought I could come
with you to the chemo today.

01:11:28.256 --> 01:11:29.791
You can forget it.

01:11:29.824 --> 01:11:32.492
We need to learn to deal with
these things without you.

01:11:57.785 --> 01:12:00.387
Mr. Wilkinson thanks
for taking my call.

01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:01.656
I'm glad I got you at home.

01:12:01.689 --> 01:12:03.758
No problem, it's
Saturday here.

01:12:03.791 --> 01:12:05.827
Firstly I would
like to apologize that

01:12:05.860 --> 01:12:08.729
it took so long for your
formal contract to arrive.

01:12:08.763 --> 01:12:11.532
Unfortunately we have a problem

01:12:11.566 --> 01:12:15.136
and I'm sorry it's only
come to light right now.

01:12:15.970 --> 01:12:17.538
The medical lab in New Zealand

01:12:17.572 --> 01:12:20.708
has received some
inconclusive results

01:12:20.741 --> 01:12:23.376
about one of your blood tests.

01:12:24.545 --> 01:12:26.848
They assumed it was
a false positive

01:12:26.881 --> 01:12:29.550
and that's what
they reported to us.

01:12:29.584 --> 01:12:33.955
So we requested the full
lab report to be sent to us.

01:12:33.988 --> 01:12:36.757
Perhaps our test are more
thorough, I don't know.

01:12:37.758 --> 01:12:38.726
What did it show?

01:12:40.628 --> 01:12:45.299
We have asked Dr. Parata

01:12:45.333 --> 01:12:46.734
to do the tests again

01:12:46.767 --> 01:12:49.136
and to include a
biopsy this time.

01:12:49.170 --> 01:12:52.607
I'm sorry to tell you this
at the 11th hour, really,

01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:56.443
but astronauts health
and safety is paramount.

01:12:56.476 --> 01:12:58.079
Can you tell me
if it's serious?

01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:01.448
You will have to discuss
that with your physician.

01:13:01.481 --> 01:13:03.851
We've sent our whole
report to Dr. Parata.

01:13:06.621 --> 01:13:09.590
Have you noticed
any swelling in your neck?

01:13:09.624 --> 01:13:10.423
No.

01:13:12.026 --> 01:13:13.493
What about in your arm pits?

01:13:13.527 --> 01:13:14.328
No.

01:13:15.763 --> 01:13:17.598
Anything in your groin?

01:13:17.632 --> 01:13:18.431
No.

01:13:20.301 --> 01:13:21.434
What about fatigue?

01:13:21.468 --> 01:13:22.670
Have you experienced
any fatigue?

01:13:24.205 --> 01:13:26.641
I reckon we all get a bit
more fatigued as we get older,

01:13:26.674 --> 01:13:27.842
but nothing more than that.

01:13:27.875 --> 01:13:29.277
What about night sweats?

01:13:30.778 --> 01:13:32.013
I've been waking up sweating,

01:13:32.046 --> 01:13:34.282
but I put that down
to the nightmares.

01:13:35.549 --> 01:13:38.119
The doctor over at
MarsX believes you have

01:13:38.152 --> 01:13:39.954
Nodular Sclerosis
Hodgkin lymphoma.

01:13:39.987 --> 01:13:42.023
It's a disease in
which malignant

01:13:42.056 --> 01:13:43.958
cancer cells form
in the lymph system.

01:13:52.333 --> 01:13:54.135
It's hereditary right?

01:13:54.168 --> 01:13:55.736
No, no, not really.

01:13:56.704 --> 01:13:57.872
My daughter's got it.

01:14:00.574 --> 01:14:03.144
I don't see your family
Mr. Wilkinson, your work...

01:14:03.177 --> 01:14:04.679
No, I know that, I know that,

01:14:04.712 --> 01:14:07.181
but she was just diagnosed with

01:14:07.214 --> 01:14:09.750
Hodgkin lymphoma
just a week ago.

01:14:11.319 --> 01:14:13.988
That's very, very disappointing,
but it's not hereditary.

01:14:30.771 --> 01:14:32.306
So what's
this all about?

01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:34.675
Do you want the good
news first or the bad news?

01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:36.210
The good news.

01:14:36.243 --> 01:14:37.511
Good news.

01:14:37.545 --> 01:14:39.246
No, the bad news
first, then the good news.

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:40.581
It's two against one.

01:14:40.614 --> 01:14:41.615
The good news first.

01:14:42.783 --> 01:14:44.318
The good news

01:14:44.352 --> 01:14:48.356
is that I am no longer on
the team going to Mars.

01:14:48.389 --> 01:14:49.190
Woo!

01:14:50.858 --> 01:14:51.959
In fact,

01:14:53.594 --> 01:14:55.763
I'm off the program altogether.

01:14:55.796 --> 01:14:58.899
So you're all gonna have to put
up with me for a bit longer.

01:15:00.401 --> 01:15:02.737
I thought it was great that
you got into the program,

01:15:02.770 --> 01:15:03.571
but,

01:15:05.706 --> 01:15:07.141
I would have really missed you.

01:15:08.642 --> 01:15:11.679
Y'know, I'm actually quite
relieved I'm not going.

01:15:11.712 --> 01:15:13.914
I was gonna miss
you all too much.

01:15:13.948 --> 01:15:15.282
Let's have a toast.

01:15:15.316 --> 01:15:16.817
To keeping this family together.

01:15:18.052 --> 01:15:19.954
To keeping
this family together.

01:15:27.895 --> 01:15:28.629
So,

01:15:31.899 --> 01:15:33.234
whats the bad news?

01:15:35.903 --> 01:15:39.540
The reason I'm
not going to Mars

01:15:40.808 --> 01:15:43.711
is that I have the same
health problem as Rachel.

01:15:45.546 --> 01:15:47.148
I have Hodgkin's lymphoma.

01:16:16.811 --> 01:16:18.979
I haven't seen you
working on this for weeks.

01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:21.348
I've been a bit tied up.

01:16:28.823 --> 01:16:31.959
Has Mom said anything
about the Hodgkin's thing?

01:16:32.960 --> 01:16:33.761
No.

01:16:35.663 --> 01:16:37.731
I'm a bit apprehensive
about the Chemo

01:16:37.765 --> 01:16:40.634
but Rachel seems to
have come through it

01:16:40.668 --> 01:16:42.203
without any side effects at all.

01:16:48.843 --> 01:16:49.643
Dad.

01:16:54.315 --> 01:16:55.983
You're gonna hate me, but,

01:16:57.284 --> 01:16:59.153
Mom said I wasn't
allowed to tell you.

01:17:01.489 --> 01:17:03.525
Rachel hasn't had any chemo.

01:17:03.558 --> 01:17:04.925
She doesn't have
Hodgkin lymphoma.

01:17:04.959 --> 01:17:07.862
Mom made it all up in the hopes
that it would make you stay.

01:17:11.198 --> 01:17:12.967
What did you just say to me?

01:17:14.135 --> 01:17:14.869
Mom made it up.

01:17:14.902 --> 01:17:15.803
I'm sorry Dad.

01:17:17.304 --> 01:17:18.839
I thought she would've told
you by now or something.

01:17:18.873 --> 01:17:20.474
I guess she's just scared
about how you're gonna react.

01:17:20.509 --> 01:17:22.843
So, you're saying
that the whole story

01:17:22.877 --> 01:17:25.646
about Rachel being
sick is bullshit?

01:17:27.715 --> 01:17:29.984
Jesus, fucking Christ!

01:17:31.852 --> 01:17:33.287
Who would do that?

01:17:33.320 --> 01:17:34.421
She's desperate Dad.

01:17:36.357 --> 01:17:37.626
None of us wanted to lose you

01:17:37.658 --> 01:17:38.859
and that's what
was gonna happen.

01:17:38.893 --> 01:17:41.228
So she told me that
Rachel had cancer?

01:17:41.262 --> 01:17:44.965
That my only daughter had cancer
to keep me from going away?

01:17:44.999 --> 01:17:47.536
I mean that's, that's appalling!

01:17:48.836 --> 01:17:51.405
It's completely unforgivable
that anyone would do that!

01:17:51.438 --> 01:17:53.542
She gave me the biggest
scare of my life!

01:17:55.610 --> 01:17:57.912
She knew it was wrong,
she didn't know what to do.

01:17:57.945 --> 01:17:59.548
Well it worked!

01:17:59.581 --> 01:18:01.882
I wrote a letter of
resignation to MarsX.

01:18:01.916 --> 01:18:03.250
I was just about to send it

01:18:03.284 --> 01:18:05.219
when I got the Skype
call from the US!

01:18:09.957 --> 01:18:11.025
Max.

01:18:12.561 --> 01:18:13.360
I'm sorry.

01:18:15.630 --> 01:18:17.264
I don't blame you
for any of this.

01:18:35.716 --> 01:18:38.185
I've a confession to make.

01:18:38.219 --> 01:18:39.954
But will you promise
not to yell at me?

01:18:39.987 --> 01:18:42.056
I believe that
Max has already told me.

01:18:42.089 --> 01:18:42.890
Has he?

01:18:44.325 --> 01:18:46.894
I can't believe that you
would do such a deceitful thing.

01:18:48.563 --> 01:18:49.296
I was wrong.

01:18:49.330 --> 01:18:50.864
Wrong?

01:18:50.898 --> 01:18:52.967
You're fucking
right it was wrong.

01:18:54.235 --> 01:18:56.437
I was bloody tormented
by that news!

01:18:58.005 --> 01:19:00.441
And now I find out that it
was some sort of sick lie?

01:19:02.142 --> 01:19:05.580
I know you'll hate me for
what I did and it was underhand,

01:19:08.449 --> 01:19:10.451
but I did it because I love you.

01:19:13.087 --> 01:19:14.021
And it was selfish.

01:19:17.091 --> 01:19:19.326
But I didn't want to lose you.

01:19:19.360 --> 01:19:21.362
You used our
daughter for a pawn.

01:19:22.697 --> 01:19:23.797
Who does that?

01:19:25.165 --> 01:19:26.668
We were scared Nick!

01:19:27.868 --> 01:19:28.802
We were hurting.

01:19:30.804 --> 01:19:32.707
You have no idea
how scared I was.

01:19:42.617 --> 01:19:44.519
Please don't be angry with me.

01:19:44.552 --> 01:19:46.453
I did it because I love you

01:19:46.487 --> 01:19:48.455
and I don't want to lose you.

01:19:50.357 --> 01:19:52.126
And I feel so bad,

01:19:52.159 --> 01:19:55.095
because I feel like
I'm responsible

01:19:55.129 --> 01:19:57.699
for you getting
this awful disease

01:19:57.732 --> 01:20:00.000
because I made up that story.

01:20:01.703 --> 01:20:03.505
You're not.

01:20:03.538 --> 01:20:05.973
But it's like I
gave you a curse

01:20:06.006 --> 01:20:07.941
when I made it up.

01:20:07.975 --> 01:20:09.009
I'm sorry.

01:20:10.811 --> 01:20:12.179
Please forgive me.

01:21:11.539 --> 01:21:14.108
Oh Nick, sorry to
call you so late.

01:21:14.141 --> 01:21:15.075
It's okay.

01:21:16.578 --> 01:21:18.078
I thought you would
rather me to call

01:21:18.112 --> 01:21:19.279
now rather than wait.

01:21:20.147 --> 01:21:22.249
Is this about my test results?

01:21:22.282 --> 01:21:23.083
Yes.

01:21:24.786 --> 01:21:27.054
It appears I owe you an apology.

01:21:27.087 --> 01:21:30.190
Dr. Parata has done further
tests as we requested

01:21:30.224 --> 01:21:33.227
and he also sent us the
results of the biopsy.

01:21:34.461 --> 01:21:36.463
It all confirmed his
original diagnosis.

01:21:38.666 --> 01:21:43.103
That I don't have
Hodgkin lymphoma?

01:21:43.137 --> 01:21:44.138
Correct.

01:21:44.171 --> 01:21:46.407
It was a false positive.

01:21:46.440 --> 01:21:48.777
It's extremely rare

01:21:48.810 --> 01:21:52.112
to get a false positive
for Hodgkin's lymphoma.

01:21:52.146 --> 01:21:56.216
My stuff up and I take
complete responsibility for it.

01:21:56.250 --> 01:21:58.986
So I definitely don't have it?

01:21:59.019 --> 01:22:01.623
No, you have
a clean bill of health.

01:22:01.656 --> 01:22:04.291
Please apologize to
your family from me,

01:22:04.324 --> 01:22:06.528
this must have given
them such a scare.

01:22:09.764 --> 01:22:10.532
So,

01:22:14.669 --> 01:22:15.670
what happens now?

01:22:17.171 --> 01:22:20.340
You are being immediately
reinstated on the team.

01:22:20.374 --> 01:22:22.276
You will re-join
the team of course?

01:22:28.015 --> 01:22:29.316
I'm sorry, I just can't,

01:22:30.652 --> 01:22:31.686
I can't do it.

01:22:31.719 --> 01:22:33.187
It's my fault.

01:22:33.220 --> 01:22:34.656
I apologize again.

01:22:34.689 --> 01:22:36.691
I should have never
told you you were

01:22:36.724 --> 01:22:39.794
off the program before
re-doing those tests.

01:22:39.828 --> 01:22:41.161
I let you down.

01:22:41.195 --> 01:22:43.598
It's not about that.

01:22:43.631 --> 01:22:46.935
Do you remember during our
initial interview when you asked

01:22:46.967 --> 01:22:48.435
if my family knew
that I'd applied.

01:22:48.469 --> 01:22:51.506
Yes, you said they did
and they were okay with it.

01:22:52.473 --> 01:22:53.207
I lied.

01:22:59.647 --> 01:23:02.249
So, they
were not okay with it?

01:23:03.685 --> 01:23:05.352
They didn't know
anything about it at all.

01:23:06.921 --> 01:23:09.189
And they have taken it badly.

01:23:11.826 --> 01:23:14.495
I'm sorry I just
can't do this to them.

01:23:16.598 --> 01:23:17.765
I have hurt my wife,

01:23:19.032 --> 01:23:20.300
and I don't know
that I will ever

01:23:20.334 --> 01:23:22.102
be able to repair that hurt.

01:23:24.104 --> 01:23:25.205
But I'm going to try.

01:23:27.675 --> 01:23:28.442
I'm sorry,

01:23:30.912 --> 01:23:32.780
but you'll need to
find a replacement.

01:24:25.265 --> 01:24:26.433
Max,

01:24:26.466 --> 01:24:28.736
This is the second
time I've called you.

01:24:28.770 --> 01:24:31.405
Coming now!

01:24:31.438 --> 01:24:33.273
Mom says you
have some news for me.

01:24:34.341 --> 01:24:37.311
Oh, I'm back in the musical.

01:24:37.344 --> 01:24:39.413
So what changed your mind?

01:24:39.446 --> 01:24:42.316
Miss Thompson said she
really needed me, so...

01:24:42.349 --> 01:24:43.383
And!

01:24:43.417 --> 01:24:46.253
And, she offered me
the role of Audrey.

01:24:47.087 --> 01:24:48.422
That's the lead part!

01:24:49.691 --> 01:24:51.158
How come?

01:24:51.191 --> 01:24:53.561
Oh, Haley's been off
school for almost three weeks

01:24:53.595 --> 01:24:57.565
and she's not back yet so, yeah.

01:24:57.599 --> 01:24:58.967
Well
congratulations Pumpkin,

01:24:59.000 --> 01:24:59.901
that's really good news!

01:24:59.934 --> 01:25:00.802
Thank you.

01:25:00.835 --> 01:25:01.769
Yeah, I'm pretty excited.

01:25:04.271 --> 01:25:06.340
Well, don't forget my offer
to help with the costumes.

01:25:06.373 --> 01:25:08.576
I reminded her today actually.

01:25:08.610 --> 01:25:12.747
Audrey gets some cool
costumes, so, I can't wait.

01:25:21.689 --> 01:25:22.991
Do you remember
me telling you about

01:25:23.024 --> 01:25:24.759
Zeke from my class?

01:25:24.792 --> 01:25:26.460
Yeah, your new friend.

01:25:27.327 --> 01:25:29.262
Actually my old friend.

01:25:29.296 --> 01:25:31.231
He's been ignoring
me at school lately.

01:25:32.399 --> 01:25:34.002
But I don't care,
he's a weirdo anyway.

01:25:38.706 --> 01:25:39.974
Any mail today?

01:25:41.475 --> 01:25:42.242
Nope.

01:25:45.412 --> 01:25:48.850
Well, I have something
that might interest you.

01:25:50.051 --> 01:25:51.753
Could you please pass
that to your mother.

01:25:53.420 --> 01:25:54.789
What's this?

01:25:54.822 --> 01:25:56.824
I guess you just
have to open it to see.

01:26:03.263 --> 01:26:05.700
Come on Mom, the
suspense is killing me!

01:26:07.035 --> 01:26:08.368
I have already
spoken to Janice.

01:26:08.402 --> 01:26:10.170
She's fine with you having
three weeks off next month.

01:26:10.203 --> 01:26:12.073
Three
weeks off for what?

01:26:12.106 --> 01:26:14.374
Your wonderful Dad
has just booked us

01:26:14.408 --> 01:26:16.678
a 14 day cruise in the Med.

01:26:21.181 --> 01:26:21.949
Thank you.

01:26:25.385 --> 01:26:27.187
Did I get the right one?

01:26:27.220 --> 01:26:28.221
It's amazing.

01:26:28.255 --> 01:26:29.624
Better than the one I'd chosen

01:26:36.463 --> 01:26:37.765
All clear above and behind!

01:26:38.966 --> 01:26:40.434
Take up slack, take up slack.

01:26:42.469 --> 01:26:43.871
All out, all out.

01:27:23.410 --> 01:27:25.412
Charlie Echo
Bravo, Alpha Kilo,

01:27:26.814 --> 01:27:27.749
thanks for the tow.
