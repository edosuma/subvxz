01:56.333 --> 01:58.727
I'm sorry
I had to do this.

02:02.339 --> 02:04.254
I know too much, so it's better

02:04.298 --> 02:07.605
I just end it my way.

02:07.649 --> 02:09.477
Everyone will be
in a better place,

02:09.520 --> 02:11.305
happier with me gone.

02:14.917 --> 02:17.093
I hope everyone understands.

02:21.445 --> 02:23.839
Love, Rachel.

02:47.602 --> 02:49.560
Mrs. Herrington?

02:49.604 --> 02:51.214
Detective Garcia.

02:51.258 --> 02:53.129
I'm Detective Carlson.

03:17.284 --> 03:18.850
Be a sadist.

03:18.894 --> 03:22.854
No matter how sweet or innocent
your leading character is,

03:22.898 --> 03:24.378
make awful things happen to them

03:24.421 --> 03:28.643
in order that the reader
may see what they are made of.

03:28.686 --> 03:30.819
Vonnegut once said this
about writing.

03:30.862 --> 03:32.777
And he was right.

03:32.821 --> 03:35.998
The written word
is a unique way for us

03:36.041 --> 03:39.871
to explore new and exciting,

03:39.915 --> 03:41.438
sometimes dangerous worlds

03:41.482 --> 03:45.660
without having to ever put
ourselves in any real danger.

03:45.703 --> 03:46.878
So that is your assignment.

03:46.922 --> 03:48.706
I want you guys
to write me a story.

03:48.750 --> 03:51.274
And I want you to thrust
your main characters

03:51.318 --> 03:54.799
into an environment
that they're not prepared for.

03:54.843 --> 03:56.888
Something unexpected.

03:56.932 --> 03:58.412
What happens to them?

03:58.455 --> 04:01.023
Do they fail? Do they succeed?

04:01.850 --> 04:03.895
That is up to you.

04:03.939 --> 04:06.855
But I want you to be bold, okay?
Take risks.

04:06.898 --> 04:09.988
Because that is what is
gonna keep me turning the page.

04:12.513 --> 04:13.992
New message.

04:14.036 --> 04:17.822
Zoe, it's me. Mom.

04:17.866 --> 04:19.649
It's about your sister.

04:19.694 --> 04:22.262
Ju-just call me back.

04:26.962 --> 04:30.008
- Zoe.
- Yeah, what's up?

04:30.052 --> 04:31.271
I don't know.

04:31.314 --> 04:33.011
Mom, I told you
not to call me, okay

04:33.055 --> 04:34.491
when you're drunk.

04:34.535 --> 04:36.667
Rachel's dead.

05:41.166 --> 05:42.124
Zoe!

05:57.313 --> 06:01.448
Rachel was like
the happiest person I know.

06:01.491 --> 06:04.364
Well, sometimes people hide
how they really feel, mom.

06:04.407 --> 06:07.932
You can't hide everything
from your mother.

06:09.107 --> 06:12.110
I-I think she fell
for the wrong guy.

06:12.154 --> 06:15.113
He was rich, he had a wife.

06:15.157 --> 06:18.160
I mean, I think he was messing
with her head.

06:19.466 --> 06:22.338
It's a little early for that,
don't you think?

06:24.122 --> 06:27.169
I just lost my baby girl.

06:27.212 --> 06:29.998
I think I'm allowed
to have a drink.

06:33.001 --> 06:35.133
She left a note at the party.

06:35.177 --> 06:38.485
She was at a party. When she...

07:42.984 --> 07:45.508
Is there anything
you need me to do?

07:49.425 --> 07:50.992
I'm gonna ask Father McCallan

07:51.035 --> 07:53.908
if we can have a proper funeral.

07:53.951 --> 07:57.172
The church doesn't allow
sacrament

07:57.215 --> 08:00.436
for... cases like Rachel's.

08:01.698 --> 08:04.048
But he's known her
since her first communion.

08:04.092 --> 08:06.573
Maybe you could
inform Rachel's workplace?

08:07.574 --> 08:09.576
Yeah. I can do that.

08:20.587 --> 08:21.979
Of course he would...
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

08:22.023 --> 08:23.546
Hold on a second.
Hold on a second.

08:23.590 --> 08:24.721
Ladies, come on inside.

08:24.765 --> 08:26.331
Tell Mickey I sent you.

08:26.375 --> 08:29.334
Yeah, of course I sent them.
I know what I sent.

08:32.250 --> 08:33.904
Bottle service
waitresses can make

08:33.948 --> 08:38.474
between $1000 and $3000 a night.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.085
Which is why a bottle girl isn't
just some waitress

08:41.129 --> 08:42.826
jotting down drink orders.

08:42.870 --> 08:44.872
They look and dress differently

08:44.915 --> 08:47.135
because they are salesmen.

08:48.092 --> 08:49.398
See that curtain back there?

08:49.441 --> 08:52.401
Behind it sits Percy.
Percy is the boss.

08:52.444 --> 08:55.404
Notice Percy is back there
and not out here with us, right?

08:55.447 --> 08:59.321
That's because she leaves the
hiring of bottle girls to me.

08:59.364 --> 09:02.890
If I don't like you,
she doesn't need you.

09:02.933 --> 09:04.369
You two here with Lolo?

09:04.413 --> 09:06.763
I'm gonna need your
Jane Hancocks on some NDAs.

09:06.807 --> 09:08.983
Hey, Bobby, I need some N...

09:10.158 --> 09:13.378
Hi. I was...
Excuse me.

09:14.945 --> 09:16.643
You know we're
hiring bottle girls

09:16.686 --> 09:18.470
not cleaning ladies, right?

09:18.514 --> 09:20.995
No, I'm not here for the job.

09:21.038 --> 09:22.779
I'm here to talk to you
about my sister.

09:22.823 --> 09:24.302
Who's your sister?

09:24.346 --> 09:26.261
Rachel Herrington.

09:33.094 --> 09:35.313
I'm sorry about your sister.

09:35.357 --> 09:38.142
- Thank you.
- Of course.

09:38.186 --> 09:40.710
So, were you two,
um, friends or...

09:40.754 --> 09:42.016
Uh, we-we work together here

09:42.059 --> 09:43.974
so, yeah,
we were friends.

09:44.018 --> 09:46.368
You know? Um, she was, um...

09:47.891 --> 09:49.110
Excuse me.

09:50.981 --> 09:53.070
Here are your sister's things.

09:53.854 --> 09:55.116
Oh.

09:55.159 --> 09:57.509
Okay. Um... right.

09:57.553 --> 09:59.642
And, uh, her last paycheck.

09:59.686 --> 10:01.165
Let us know if there's
anything we can do.

10:01.209 --> 10:03.907
Oh! Wow, Rach.

10:03.951 --> 10:07.694
Huh. Clearly I picked the wrong
profession as a teacher.

10:07.737 --> 10:10.261
- You're a teacher?
- Yes, I'm a teacher.

10:10.305 --> 10:12.829
Oh.
Maybe you should apply here.

10:12.873 --> 10:13.917
- Ex-excuse me?
- Yeah, yeah.

10:13.961 --> 10:15.179
A school teacher by day

10:15.223 --> 10:16.703
a hot cocktail waitress
by night.

10:16.746 --> 10:18.269
Hey, show some respect.

10:18.313 --> 10:19.619
- She just lost her sister.
- All right.

10:19.662 --> 10:22.099
You're right.
I apologize. My bad.

10:23.710 --> 10:25.320
- Sorry about that.
- All right.

10:25.363 --> 10:27.627
- You take care, Zoe.
- Thank you. Yup.

10:38.986 --> 10:40.465
Mo... Mom?

10:42.206 --> 10:44.165
Uh... What are you doing? Mom?

10:44.208 --> 10:45.862
- Hey. What are you doing?
- She didn't do it.

10:45.906 --> 10:48.735
She wouldn't leave me alone.

10:48.778 --> 10:50.737
Rachel kept a journal?

10:52.042 --> 10:53.478
Wait. Mom?

10:57.004 --> 10:58.745
Rachel didn't kill herself.

10:58.788 --> 11:01.138
Does this handwriting
look the same?

11:01.182 --> 11:03.706
Yeah. It does.
It looks exactly the same.

11:03.750 --> 11:06.970
- She was clearly depressed.
- Oh...

11:07.014 --> 11:09.625
Well, if she was clearly
depressed then I would've known.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.627
- I would have known.
- Oh, really?

11:11.671 --> 11:13.455
Why do you think
that you would have known?

11:13.498 --> 11:15.762
Do you think that you would've
even noticed?

11:17.807 --> 11:20.810
When was the last time
you spoke to her?

11:20.854 --> 11:23.726
I saw her two years ago,
but she was barely there.

11:23.770 --> 11:25.772
She came by my work
and she left right away.

11:25.815 --> 11:27.208
- I...
- Exactly.

11:27.251 --> 11:28.731
And I was here with her.

11:28.775 --> 11:31.734
- I was here.
- Okay, you were here, mom.

11:31.778 --> 11:33.736
You were here with Rachel,
and what happened?

11:33.780 --> 11:36.173
She was working
in some sleazy nightclub.

11:36.217 --> 11:37.784
So what? You could just
stay home and drink...

11:37.827 --> 11:40.090
Oh, yeah, that's easy
for you to say

11:40.134 --> 11:42.571
because you left!

11:42.614 --> 11:43.746
I had to.

11:44.660 --> 11:46.749
I had to leave.

11:46.793 --> 11:48.316
Look at you.

11:48.359 --> 11:52.015
You, you're just like him.

11:52.059 --> 11:55.715
When things get rough, you run!

11:58.239 --> 12:01.764
Mom, you are, you're lashing out
at me because you're upset,

12:01.808 --> 12:04.375
but that's not gonna
bring Rachel back.

12:15.691 --> 12:17.606
Zoe sent me
another book today.

12:17.649 --> 12:19.303
Not sure
why she keeps doing that.

12:19.347 --> 12:20.870
I haven't read any of them.

12:20.914 --> 12:24.047
Don't have the heart
to tell her.

12:24.091 --> 12:26.484
People think the club is
some super-glamorous place

12:26.528 --> 12:28.660
where everyone is
beautiful and happy.

12:28.704 --> 12:30.488
The reality is
most people are there

12:30.532 --> 12:32.708
because they want
to escape real life.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.797
Like Zoe does with her books.

12:34.841 --> 12:37.060
Except I prefer interacting
with real people,

12:37.104 --> 12:38.801
not fictional ones.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.383
Oh, thank you.

12:57.864 --> 12:58.778
Rach.

13:00.518 --> 13:02.346
Still obsessed
with books, I see.

13:02.390 --> 13:04.696
Yeah. The classics mostly.

13:04.740 --> 13:07.961
But crime novels are
your guilty pleasure, right?

13:08.004 --> 13:10.180
Guilty.

13:10.224 --> 13:11.878
What are you doing here?

13:11.921 --> 13:15.098
Uh, just thought I'll stop by
and see what's up.

13:15.142 --> 13:18.232
- What's up?
- What's up with you?

13:21.496 --> 13:24.499
Oh, my God. You're here
about mom, aren't you?

13:24.542 --> 13:26.544
No, she doesn't know I'm here.

13:26.588 --> 13:28.808
Mm-hm. I'm sure she does.

13:28.851 --> 13:31.723
You know, Rach,
this is, this is...

13:31.767 --> 13:33.856
This is what she does.
She uses people.

13:35.205 --> 13:37.425
She just wants to see you.

13:37.468 --> 13:38.992
I thought maybe
you could come with me.

13:39.035 --> 13:40.732
We could surprise her
for her birthday.

13:40.776 --> 13:42.909
Not for her to feel better,

13:42.952 --> 13:45.476
but for me, and for you.

13:47.914 --> 13:50.220
- She texted you.
- Don't worry about it.

13:50.264 --> 13:53.484
Rach, I'm your sister. Of course
I'm gonna worry about it.

13:53.528 --> 13:56.357
Hey. Why don't you come over
to my place?

13:56.400 --> 13:57.619
Stay with me for a few days.

13:57.662 --> 14:01.014
We can have a,
a sister slumber party.

14:01.057 --> 14:03.016
Hm? I miss you. It'll be fun.

14:03.059 --> 14:04.408
I miss you, too.

14:04.452 --> 14:06.976
But I have to work tonight.

14:07.020 --> 14:09.022
Rain check?

14:09.065 --> 14:10.893
It's good to see you.

15:00.334 --> 15:01.596
Excuse me.

15:01.639 --> 15:04.338
Hi. My name is Larry. Uh...

15:04.381 --> 15:06.557
I knew your sister.

15:06.601 --> 15:09.734
I... Man, this is hard. Um...

15:09.778 --> 15:12.650
I'm really sorry for your loss.

15:12.694 --> 15:16.176
- Thank you.
- This never should've happened.

15:16.219 --> 15:18.787
Well, you know, sometimes
you never know what someone's...

15:18.830 --> 15:21.007
No, I mean there's something
you should know about Rachel.

15:21.050 --> 15:22.834
- Get out...
- The night that she died, I...

15:22.878 --> 15:23.879
Excuse me.

15:25.881 --> 15:27.491
This is your fault.

15:27.535 --> 15:30.364
I'm so sorry.
I'm-I'm devastated.

15:30.407 --> 15:34.281
- How dare you come here!
- Rachel was an amazing...

15:34.324 --> 15:36.500
You're even saying her name!

15:36.544 --> 15:38.154
Just get out of here!

15:49.078 --> 15:51.951
That's Richie Evans!
He was with Rachel!

15:51.994 --> 15:55.389
Stop pushing me!
That's Richie Evans!

16:19.674 --> 16:20.892
Last night,
I went to an after-party

16:20.936 --> 16:22.546
at a billionaire's house.

16:22.590 --> 16:24.766
His name's Richie, of course.

16:24.809 --> 16:27.812
Weird thing is, he doesn't
live at this house.

16:27.856 --> 16:30.032
It's just a party house.

16:30.076 --> 16:32.817
Richie told me
he wants to leave his wife,

16:32.861 --> 16:35.864
but he's afraid he'll lose
everything in a divorce.

16:35.907 --> 16:37.518
I know Richie is a client
and all,

16:37.561 --> 16:40.173
but I can't help
falling for him.

16:40.216 --> 16:41.739
He told me that he can't
be himself

16:41.783 --> 16:44.438
when he's around anyone else
but me.

16:44.481 --> 16:46.005
Even his wife.

16:50.835 --> 16:52.620
I don't know
what to do.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.667
I found out the truth
about Richie.

16:56.711 --> 16:59.801
I hope it's not true,
I really do.

17:10.203 --> 17:13.075
Rachel didn't
kill herself. I can prove it.

17:13.118 --> 17:15.382
Last night, one of her friends
from the club...

17:15.425 --> 17:17.601
Larry, approached me.

17:17.645 --> 17:20.778
And he told me he had something
to tell me about Rachel.

17:20.821 --> 17:23.172
Until I called him,
and he hasn't answered yet.

17:23.215 --> 17:26.219
But I'm betting that he's gonna
tell me something about Rachel

17:26.262 --> 17:29.657
that proves that she didn't
commit suicide.

17:36.838 --> 17:39.319
Good morning.
Thank you for coming.

17:39.362 --> 17:40.624
Mom, what's going on?

17:40.668 --> 17:42.496
Your mother called
to let us know

17:42.539 --> 17:43.801
she has some new information.

17:43.845 --> 17:45.803
- Come in, please.
- Thank you.

17:45.847 --> 17:46.761
Thanks.

17:49.198 --> 17:51.853
...and, uh,
that's when I called you.

17:51.896 --> 17:54.116
Now I'm just waiting
for this Larry guy

17:54.160 --> 17:55.422
to, uh, call me back

17:55.465 --> 17:56.901
because I am sure that he knows

17:56.945 --> 17:58.207
what really happened to Rachel.

17:58.251 --> 18:00.688
I mean, why else would he
talk to me?

18:02.037 --> 18:05.040
- Is this Larry?
- That's him.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.824
Lawrence Reynolds
went for a swim

18:06.868 --> 18:08.696
at Richie Evans' place
last night

18:08.739 --> 18:10.654
and forgot to get out
of the pool.

18:10.698 --> 18:14.223
He was found this morning,
floating face down.

18:14.267 --> 18:17.357
So, first my daughter,
and now Larry?

18:17.400 --> 18:19.054
And that's not enough?

18:19.098 --> 18:20.664
I understand.

18:20.708 --> 18:23.276
And that's why we came over
when you called.

18:23.319 --> 18:25.713
We'll stay on it.

18:25.756 --> 18:28.759
Uh, Larry
approached me too.

18:28.803 --> 18:30.848
At the funeral service,
it was about Rachel.

18:30.892 --> 18:33.721
And I didn't think
it was big deal.

18:34.722 --> 18:35.940
I'm sorry.

18:36.985 --> 18:39.857
You see? Larry knew something

18:39.901 --> 18:44.384
that Richie doesn't want
anyone else to know.

18:44.427 --> 18:46.690
We'd have to connect those dots.

18:46.734 --> 18:48.518
Right now, I... I'm sorry.

18:48.562 --> 18:51.304
We simply don't have
a lot to go on.

19:02.141 --> 19:05.709
I have a son. I can't imagine
what you're going through.

19:05.753 --> 19:07.711
If anything else comes up,

19:07.755 --> 19:10.758
please don't hesitate
in calling.

19:38.438 --> 19:41.092
What if the answer we're looking
for is in these missing pages?

19:41.136 --> 19:43.138
What are you saying?

19:45.271 --> 19:47.098
Mom, what if Richie Evans
did kill Rachel

19:47.142 --> 19:48.926
and made it look like a suicide?

19:48.970 --> 19:50.798
So you believe me now?

19:50.841 --> 19:52.930
Well, I... I mean, I-I have to.

19:52.974 --> 19:55.803
It just makes sense, right?

19:55.846 --> 19:57.761
Larry must've found out about it

19:57.805 --> 20:00.764
and was trying to warn us.

20:00.808 --> 20:04.594
So, Richie got rid of him
to cover it all up.

20:04.638 --> 20:06.901
Well, there has to be
something else in here that

20:06.944 --> 20:08.642
that can help us.

20:10.687 --> 20:12.994
"The house." Yes. Okay.

20:13.037 --> 20:14.909
Richie had this house that
he always throws parties at.

20:14.952 --> 20:16.954
If Richie is responsible,

20:16.998 --> 20:18.782
then there has to be a clue
somewhere in that house.

20:18.826 --> 20:20.610
All I have to do now is
just find the address.

20:20.654 --> 20:23.439
No, Zoe, this isn't one of
your crime books you read.

20:23.483 --> 20:26.790
- Mom, I know that.
- No, no, listen to me.

20:26.834 --> 20:29.010
This is real life.

20:29.053 --> 20:32.013
Mom, the most dangerous thing
I face on a day-to-day basis

20:32.056 --> 20:34.276
are 17-year-old drivers
in a school parking lot.

20:34.320 --> 20:37.540
I know I am
out of my league here, okay?

20:37.584 --> 20:40.064
And, yeah, I-I'm scared.

20:42.676 --> 20:44.765
But you were right.

20:44.808 --> 20:47.333
Rachel deserves the truth.

20:52.773 --> 20:55.645
Rachel met Richie at the club.

20:55.689 --> 20:58.648
He goes to the club
all the time.

20:58.692 --> 21:01.303
Right. The club. Yes.
Yes. That's it.

21:01.347 --> 21:03.784
Then-then that is exactly
where I have to start.

21:03.827 --> 21:05.655
I have to go to the club
a-and find Richie,

21:05.699 --> 21:07.744
ask him questions and then tell

21:07.788 --> 21:09.311
the detectives
everything that I know.

21:09.355 --> 21:12.967
No, Zoe, everyone
at that club is crazy.

21:13.010 --> 21:15.448
Well, it sounds like
my second period class.

21:15.491 --> 21:17.493
I'm gonna be fine, mom.

21:17.537 --> 21:19.713
I have a secret weapon.

21:29.723 --> 21:32.595
Night clubs
are like a foreign country.

21:32.639 --> 21:34.902
They have a language
and culture all their own.

21:34.945 --> 21:37.208
And they don't just
let anyone in.

21:39.907 --> 21:43.867
Sometimes, guys ask girls from
the line to join them inside.

21:45.608 --> 21:47.958
But that only works
if the girl passes muster

21:48.002 --> 21:50.352
with the doorman.

21:50.396 --> 21:54.313
Sometimes, just the guy doesn't
pass muster with the doorman.

22:38.661 --> 22:39.836
Hi.

22:40.881 --> 22:42.317
- Hey.
- Hi.

22:42.361 --> 22:46.277
Didn't I see you at my sister's
memorial service?

22:46.321 --> 22:47.278
Yes.

22:48.497 --> 22:50.804
What are you doing here?

22:50.847 --> 22:53.937
Just... clubbin'.

22:55.809 --> 22:57.332
What are you doing here?

22:57.376 --> 22:58.942
Uh, hobby.

22:58.986 --> 23:01.162
Photographing the rich
and douchey?

23:01.205 --> 23:04.295
Professional courtesy
prevents me from divulging.

23:04.339 --> 23:08.038
Oh. So, you're like a,
a paparazzi or something, right?

23:08.082 --> 23:09.823
Or something.

23:11.172 --> 23:13.870
So, how do you know Rach?

23:13.914 --> 23:17.439
- She dated a guy I know.
- Yeah. Richie. Exactly.

23:17.483 --> 23:19.789
I'm trying to get in
so I can talk to him.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.748
But it's all, you know

23:21.791 --> 23:24.359
velvet ropey and listy
and stuff.

23:24.403 --> 23:27.362
- Do you have any advice for me?
- No. Nope.

23:27.406 --> 23:28.885
Even if you could
get into the club

23:28.929 --> 23:30.626
you can't just walk up to people
like Richie.

23:30.670 --> 23:32.454
Security is tight and all, so...

23:32.498 --> 23:34.369
Well, I... All right.

23:35.501 --> 23:37.111
Why don't you just tell me
what you know

23:37.154 --> 23:39.200
about my sister and Richie?

23:42.029 --> 23:44.161
Listen, I'm really enjoying

23:44.205 --> 23:47.600
this flirtatious conversation.

23:47.643 --> 23:50.167
But, uh, I just started the car.

23:50.211 --> 23:52.169
- So that means I'm leaving.
- Okay. Wait.

23:52.213 --> 23:53.867
- Have a great day.
- I'm not done yet. I...

23:53.910 --> 23:56.435
- I'm done.
- Are you just gonna dri...

23:56.478 --> 23:57.436
What?

24:00.177 --> 24:01.788
Clubs need girls,
and promoters

24:01.831 --> 24:03.137
are the guys who supply them.

24:03.180 --> 24:05.052
Promoters are like vultures

24:05.095 --> 24:07.576
hanging around shopping malls,
coffee shops

24:07.620 --> 24:08.925
and model castings.

24:08.969 --> 24:10.318
But often times, they simply use

24:10.361 --> 24:12.494
good old-fashioned social media.

24:12.538 --> 24:15.192
A promoter's job is to get
pretty girls into the clubs

24:15.236 --> 24:17.281
so that the guys spend a lot
of money on them.

24:17.325 --> 24:21.285
It's a sleazy job and nobody's
better at that than Lolo.

24:21.329 --> 24:24.201
Once a girl DMs him,
he'll set up a meet-and-greet.

24:24.245 --> 24:26.203
And if he likes what he sees,
he invites them

24:26.247 --> 24:27.727
to one of his pre-parties.

24:27.770 --> 24:29.685
That's where he weeds out
the girls.

24:29.729 --> 24:32.035
Figures out which ones
need to be there,

24:32.079 --> 24:33.776
and which ones don't.

24:33.820 --> 24:35.038
Hello?

24:40.566 --> 24:41.567
Hello?

25:11.945 --> 25:14.991
Ooh. God, you're sexy.

25:16.776 --> 25:19.082
You my four o'clock?

25:19.126 --> 25:20.693
Yep, that's me.

25:22.564 --> 25:23.870
Hey.

25:23.913 --> 25:25.959
It is you,
I was hoping it was you.

25:26.002 --> 25:27.438
It's me.

25:27.482 --> 25:29.702
Are you like a,
like a librarian?

25:29.745 --> 25:31.442
No, I was a teacher.

25:31.486 --> 25:33.314
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Teacher,
librarian the same thing.

25:33.357 --> 25:35.446
No, it's not really
the same thing.

25:35.490 --> 25:37.536
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Kind of.

25:37.579 --> 25:40.234
Well, no.
No, I-I-I wasn't a librarian.

25:40.277 --> 25:42.323
And I am no longer
a teacher either,

25:42.366 --> 25:45.456
but I am here
and I wanna come to your party.

25:45.500 --> 25:48.111
I don't need
any more regular girls.

25:48.155 --> 25:50.810
I do need more models, though.

25:50.853 --> 25:53.116
Well...

25:53.160 --> 25:55.641
Lucky for you...

25:55.684 --> 25:58.469
I'm not just a regular girl.

25:58.513 --> 26:00.733
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hm.

26:00.776 --> 26:02.604
So what makes you so special?

26:02.648 --> 26:04.954
And you're gonna have
to invite me to your party

26:04.998 --> 26:06.608
to find out why.

26:08.001 --> 26:10.351
Okay, whatever.

26:15.965 --> 26:17.488
So, here you go.

26:17.532 --> 26:18.707
All right.

26:18.751 --> 26:21.667
And we'll see
why you're so special.

26:21.710 --> 26:23.494
You're gonna... Yep, yep.

26:23.538 --> 26:26.280
I'll show you something special.

26:28.195 --> 26:29.500
Okay, so, where were we?

26:39.685 --> 26:41.600
- Rachel actually wore this?
- Yeah.

26:41.643 --> 26:43.123
Doesn't the walk of shame
usually come

26:43.166 --> 26:44.211
at the end of the night?

26:44.254 --> 26:46.169
- Usually.
- Usually. Yeah.

26:46.866 --> 26:48.737
You look great.

26:49.956 --> 26:51.653
Okay.

26:51.697 --> 26:55.222
Ooh, are you sure
you wanna do this?

26:55.265 --> 26:58.399
No, but I gotta
live a little, mom.

27:25.731 --> 27:28.864
Hi, excuse me,
do you know where Lolo...

27:28.908 --> 27:30.039
Thank you.

27:41.224 --> 27:42.661
Excuse me.

27:50.320 --> 27:53.193
- Oh, hi... Oh!
- Oh, there she is!

27:53.236 --> 27:55.499
The goddess
I've been waiting for.

27:55.543 --> 27:57.676
- I've been talking you up.
- Oh!

27:57.719 --> 28:00.722
So, uh, do you need
a place to stay?

28:00.766 --> 28:02.942
- Huh? No. No. No.
- Well, let me know if you do.

28:02.985 --> 28:05.553
A lot of models need a place to
stay when they first start out.

28:05.596 --> 28:07.033
You know,
it's a very tough business.

28:07.076 --> 28:08.730
Very, very competitive.

28:08.774 --> 28:11.428
So you're like their...
uh, my agent?

28:11.472 --> 28:13.126
Yeah, something like that.

28:14.040 --> 28:17.347
- Okay.
- Okay.

28:17.391 --> 28:20.611
- So, this is how this works.
- Oh.

28:20.655 --> 28:22.396
- You lead 'em on.
- Yep.

28:22.439 --> 28:24.528
And then we get you both...

28:24.572 --> 28:26.748
- That's how you get paid.
- I see.

28:26.792 --> 28:28.445
You wanna dance?

28:28.489 --> 28:30.796
Yes, I do.

28:32.623 --> 28:35.191
It's not with me.
It's with them.

28:36.845 --> 28:40.066
Oh!

28:55.211 --> 28:57.736
See? That's what
I'm talkin' about.

29:03.698 --> 29:05.091
How you doin'?

29:05.134 --> 29:07.223
I'm Brad.

29:07.267 --> 29:08.616
You're hot.

29:10.574 --> 29:13.795
I told Lolo
that I wanted a American girl

29:13.839 --> 29:15.231
next full time.

29:16.624 --> 29:18.669
I'm glad he came through for me.

29:26.416 --> 29:28.941
Uh, I just, um...

29:31.900 --> 29:33.467
Sorry.

29:54.749 --> 29:57.534
Don't you walk
away from me.

29:57.578 --> 29:59.232
Don't you walk away.

29:59.275 --> 30:02.017
Fine. Go!

30:02.061 --> 30:04.454
She is impossible.

30:04.498 --> 30:05.804
I knew this was gonna happen.

30:05.847 --> 30:07.370
When I came home,
I knew this would happen

30:07.414 --> 30:08.850
and I came home anyway,
and I shouldn't have

30:08.894 --> 30:10.373
even come home
in the first place.

30:10.417 --> 30:12.071
Where are you going?
You just got here.

30:12.114 --> 30:15.117
- Home.
- This is your home.

30:15.161 --> 30:17.728
Nope, not my home. Not anymore.

30:17.772 --> 30:19.730
Honestly, I-I don't know
how you still live with her.

30:19.774 --> 30:22.995
She is the most
self-absorbed person

30:23.038 --> 30:24.561
I've ever met in my life.

30:24.605 --> 30:27.390
Here. This is for mom.

30:27.434 --> 30:28.914
This is for you.

30:32.265 --> 30:34.876
- Zoe?
- What, Rachel?

30:34.920 --> 30:36.573
- Take me with you.
- Don't be ridiculous.

30:36.617 --> 30:38.097
You know I can't do that.

31:00.946 --> 31:02.382
Okay.

31:56.305 --> 31:57.654
All right! Okay!

31:57.698 --> 31:59.395
Okay, so who wants to go
to the club?

31:59.439 --> 32:02.790
Who wants to go to the club?

32:02.833 --> 32:04.574
Let's go!

32:04.618 --> 32:06.968
All right, guys. Get in.

32:07.012 --> 32:10.015
Come on, come on, come on,
come on.

32:10.058 --> 32:12.495
All right, guys...

32:17.283 --> 32:19.502
Welcome to Lolo's world!

32:26.683 --> 32:28.555
I'd like to introduce you
to Rachel.

32:30.078 --> 32:31.732
Where do you think you're going?

32:31.775 --> 32:34.474
- Just...
- Don't forget who got you here.

32:37.129 --> 32:38.391
Go ahead.

32:44.223 --> 32:46.703
You ever been to Ibiza?

32:48.575 --> 32:50.490
I'm going tonight.

32:52.448 --> 32:54.537
I have a yacht.

32:55.669 --> 32:59.499
Just you and I on the ocean.

33:14.601 --> 33:16.124
Hey, hey, hey, hey, it's okay.

33:16.168 --> 33:18.648
It's okay, she's with me.

33:18.692 --> 33:20.172
You're being very rude
to my friend.

33:20.215 --> 33:22.174
Now, get back there
and make me some money.

33:26.091 --> 33:27.614
I quit.

33:34.621 --> 33:37.450
There is another way
into the club.

33:38.320 --> 33:39.669
Work there.

33:43.108 --> 33:45.675
Most people
don't realize that...

33:45.719 --> 33:49.027
a bottle of champagne...
it's like weapon.

33:49.070 --> 33:51.855
You can use it to bash someone
in the head.

33:51.899 --> 33:53.292
Not that I recommend that.

33:53.335 --> 33:55.555
Unless of course, he deserve it.

33:55.598 --> 33:57.731
Or...

33:57.774 --> 34:00.212
you can get a VIP whale

34:00.255 --> 34:02.736
to buy a dozen of 'em.

34:02.779 --> 34:05.391
Jackie, you've been killing it
out there.

34:05.434 --> 34:07.219
Our best bottle girl.

34:07.262 --> 34:10.396
Percy is very pleased with you.

34:10.438 --> 34:12.092
So am I.

34:12.137 --> 34:16.184
Thanks. This job's been
a life saver, Mickey.

34:16.228 --> 34:18.926
I needed the money bad.

34:22.625 --> 34:24.844
Listen, what if I told you

34:24.888 --> 34:27.804
there was a way you can make
even more money.

34:27.848 --> 34:29.893
Making more money is good.

34:29.937 --> 34:31.547
But you gotta work hard.

34:31.591 --> 34:34.942
I'm willing to work hard,
of course.

34:34.985 --> 34:36.726
I like that.

34:38.163 --> 34:40.904
Listen, why don't we
get together after your shift

34:40.947 --> 34:42.210
and talk about your future.

34:42.254 --> 34:43.210
Mm-hm.

34:55.614 --> 34:58.183
Ladies, my name's Mickey.

34:58.226 --> 34:59.532
Thank you for coming.

34:59.575 --> 35:02.361
This club has a reputation.

35:02.404 --> 35:03.840
Beautiful women come here

35:03.884 --> 35:05.755
and beautiful women work here.

35:05.799 --> 35:07.583
My boss Percy over there ha...

35:10.456 --> 35:13.502
- Uh, Zoe.
- Yeah.

35:13.546 --> 35:14.677
What can I help you with?

35:14.721 --> 35:18.551
I think that you
could do me a favor.

35:18.594 --> 35:22.685
You could hire me
as a cocktail waitress.

35:24.426 --> 35:26.036
You remember what Lolo said.

35:26.080 --> 35:29.518
You know he said, "Tutor by day,
hot cocktail waitress by night."

35:29.562 --> 35:31.172
Yeah, let me get this straight.

35:31.216 --> 35:34.654
First, you try to get into the
club the other night with Lolo.

35:34.697 --> 35:37.831
Now you're here
asking me for a job?

35:37.874 --> 35:41.443
Yes, because I am
very ambitious.

35:43.576 --> 35:45.665
Have you worked in a club, Zoe?

35:45.708 --> 35:48.058
No, but I have read
a lot about them.

35:48.102 --> 35:51.410
A lot and I am
a really fast learner.

35:51.453 --> 35:54.195
I-I... Very fast. So?

35:57.546 --> 36:00.767
All right, Mickey, uh,
you know, um...

36:02.247 --> 36:05.250
See, it's just that...
The truth is

36:05.293 --> 36:07.730
Rachel's death really has me
re-thinking my life

36:07.774 --> 36:09.210
and I just...

36:09.254 --> 36:12.170
I feel like
if she could do this...

36:12.213 --> 36:13.040
then I know I could.

36:13.083 --> 36:15.608
Listen, I run a night club

36:15.651 --> 36:18.219
not a charity, sorry.

36:19.394 --> 36:22.571
Ladies, where was I?

36:22.615 --> 36:25.226
My boss Percy trusts
my opinion...

36:25.270 --> 36:26.793
Mickey is the gatekeeper,

36:26.836 --> 36:28.621
but the owner
of the club, Percy,

36:28.664 --> 36:30.275
makes the final hiring choices.

36:30.318 --> 36:32.581
Thing is, Mickey makes it
very hard

36:32.625 --> 36:35.236
to get Percy's attention.

36:35.280 --> 36:38.108
Why?

36:38.152 --> 36:40.763
- My life is over!
- What are you doing?

36:40.807 --> 36:42.591
- Nothing!
- Get up.

36:42.635 --> 36:44.637
I've got nothing!

36:44.680 --> 36:47.814
Shut up!

36:47.857 --> 36:49.250
Get up!

36:49.294 --> 36:51.121
What is all this?

36:51.165 --> 36:54.603
It's nothing.
Got it under control.

36:54.647 --> 36:56.997
Rachel Herrington was my sister.

36:59.478 --> 37:04.396
Condolences. Now, why are you
making a racket in my club?

37:04.439 --> 37:06.267
Look, uh...

37:06.311 --> 37:08.965
Rachel was happiest
when she was here

37:09.009 --> 37:12.708
and I'm a mess without her.

37:12.752 --> 37:16.277
My mom's crazy,
and I have nothing left.

37:16.321 --> 37:18.236
Nothing, truly.

37:18.279 --> 37:19.802
And I just feel
like if I could...

37:19.846 --> 37:21.717
if I could just be here,
I could just be

37:21.761 --> 37:23.893
a little bit closer
to her right now,

37:23.937 --> 37:27.288
and I am just asking you,
woman to woman,

37:27.332 --> 37:30.204
please just,
just give me a shot.

37:34.208 --> 37:35.905
You are...

37:37.385 --> 37:39.779
very beautiful.

37:41.824 --> 37:43.304
Let's try her out tonight.

37:43.348 --> 37:45.306
See how she does.

37:45.350 --> 37:46.742
But don't ever

37:46.786 --> 37:48.483
put that "girl" card
with me again.

37:48.527 --> 37:49.702
Understood?

37:51.356 --> 37:52.748
And tell that idiot DJ

37:52.792 --> 37:54.272
ease off
on the smoke machine tonight.

37:54.315 --> 37:56.317
Last night looked like a damn
forest fire in here.

37:56.361 --> 37:58.885
People need to see
who's in front of them.

38:06.849 --> 38:09.504
Well, now you've done it.

38:09.548 --> 38:11.201
Loosen up.

38:11.245 --> 38:13.769
All right, everybody, listen up.
Meet the new fresh meat.

38:13.813 --> 38:16.163
Her name is Zoe.

38:16.206 --> 38:18.774
Zoe, you'll be trailing
with Missy tonight.

38:18.818 --> 38:20.341
Oh, come on, Mickey.

38:20.385 --> 38:24.127
Wha-what's the point, she's not
even gonna last a week.

38:24.171 --> 38:25.041
Good luck.

38:42.015 --> 38:43.712
All right, so that table
over there

38:43.756 --> 38:45.192
always orders four bottles.

38:45.235 --> 38:48.108
I-I can't hear you over
this ear shattering music.

38:48.151 --> 38:51.459
Hi, boys, meet you
in four minutes.

39:00.425 --> 39:02.383
Wa-wait, wait.
How did you do that?

39:02.427 --> 39:05.255
It's easy. Here, fine,
I'll do it slow for you.

39:05.299 --> 39:06.344
Got it?

39:07.257 --> 39:08.781
Yep.

39:11.087 --> 39:12.480
Hi, what can I get you?

39:12.524 --> 39:15.265
We'll take five... vodka sodas.

39:15.309 --> 39:17.790
- Okay.
- Actually.

39:17.833 --> 39:21.010
- Make it six.
- Six.

39:23.317 --> 39:24.623
What's the matter with you?

39:24.666 --> 39:25.885
I'm trying to order

39:25.928 --> 39:27.713
six vodka sodas and...

39:27.756 --> 39:30.585
Bitch, we sell bottles, okay?
They make their own drinks.

39:30.629 --> 39:33.066
Here.

39:33.109 --> 39:35.547
One bottle's
over a thousand dollars.

39:35.590 --> 39:38.288
Dorothy, you ain't
in Kansas anymore. Move!

39:46.166 --> 39:47.776
- Okay...
- Hey, you got it.

39:52.825 --> 39:54.174
Ha!

39:56.002 --> 39:58.134
Yeah, come on, guys,
it's Saturday night.

39:58.178 --> 40:01.224
- Live it up a little.
- Oh, yeah.

40:03.052 --> 40:04.837
Whoo!

40:05.707 --> 40:07.405
Here you go.

40:12.018 --> 40:14.716
- That was gross.
- It's part of the job.

40:14.760 --> 40:18.416
We carry a bottle,
we drop it at a table, make 20%.

40:18.459 --> 40:21.723
For that kind of money,
you gotta deal with all types.

40:21.767 --> 40:23.769
But you handled it well.

40:23.812 --> 40:25.988
Flirty smile, quick exit.

40:26.032 --> 40:27.816
Most girls would have freaked.

40:27.860 --> 40:31.167
I'm impressed, Dorothy.

40:44.050 --> 40:45.530
Been watching you.

40:47.575 --> 40:49.534
Nice job out there tonight.

40:52.145 --> 40:54.277
I think you might have
what it takes.

41:09.641 --> 41:11.773
Hi. New girl.

41:11.817 --> 41:13.514
What're you doing in here?

41:13.558 --> 41:15.081
Oh, hi, I'm Zoe.

41:15.124 --> 41:17.300
- This is my first day...
- No, I know who you are.

41:17.344 --> 41:20.913
Rachel Herrington was kind of
like a goddess around here.

41:22.088 --> 41:24.133
I am sorry for your loss.

41:24.177 --> 41:26.440
Rachel was more than a coworker.

41:27.572 --> 41:29.443
She was a friend.

41:30.966 --> 41:32.228
Thank you.

41:32.272 --> 41:35.101
Yeah, but like, this is random.

41:35.144 --> 41:37.277
Right? You working here.

41:37.320 --> 41:39.235
Weren't you, like, a teacher?

41:39.279 --> 41:41.150
Yeah, I was a teacher,

41:41.194 --> 41:43.849
but, you know, the pay sucks.

41:43.892 --> 41:45.851
So, I'm here now

41:45.894 --> 41:48.723
and I love it, it's awesome.

41:48.767 --> 41:50.769
Hey, um, do you know Richie?

41:50.812 --> 41:53.293
Is he coming tonight?

41:54.990 --> 41:56.731
Why?

41:56.775 --> 41:58.646
- Well, uh...
- Zoe, psst!

42:00.387 --> 42:03.999
- Hi.
- What are you doing in here?

42:04.043 --> 42:07.350
- Uh...
- Get back to your section now.

42:08.526 --> 42:09.701
Yep.

42:13.705 --> 42:15.533
You were good, Missy.

42:19.624 --> 42:20.625
Hey.

42:22.322 --> 42:24.237
Where's the rest of it?

42:24.280 --> 42:26.456
- It was my first day.
- So?

42:27.632 --> 42:31.287
So... Okay, I'll do
better next time.

42:32.506 --> 42:34.769
Don't you ever try
any of that crap again.

42:34.813 --> 42:36.205
You hear me?

42:36.249 --> 42:39.295
You're a waitress,
not a bottle girl.

42:39.339 --> 42:41.863
You gotta earn your way
into the VIP.

42:44.866 --> 42:46.172
Go!

42:53.788 --> 42:55.747
- Hey, Valerie.
- Hmm?

42:55.790 --> 42:57.226
So, um,

42:57.270 --> 43:00.490
how does someone get into VIP?

43:00.534 --> 43:04.233
Oh, only bottle girls
work in there.

43:04.277 --> 43:07.323
And how does someone become
a bottle girl?

43:11.980 --> 43:14.026
What are you up to?

43:14.069 --> 43:16.071
What? Nothing.

43:16.115 --> 43:19.771
Just curious how it worked.

43:21.207 --> 43:23.644
Don't kick the hornet's nest.

43:23.688 --> 43:25.385
That metaphor
is slightly overused.

43:25.428 --> 43:28.301
But I think I know
what you're trying to say.

43:31.565 --> 43:32.566
She's right.

43:34.568 --> 43:36.570
So, um...

43:38.398 --> 43:41.662
Do these women actually...

43:41.706 --> 43:44.012
sleep with the men?

43:44.056 --> 43:48.321
Most bottle girls don't sleep
with their clients, no.

43:48.364 --> 43:50.497
But they do flirt with them.
Stay in touch with them.

43:50.540 --> 43:54.806
Make these guys feel
like nobody else matters 24x7.

43:54.849 --> 43:56.677
And if the clients ask for it,

43:56.721 --> 44:00.420
yeah, get them other girls
that will do party favors.

44:00.463 --> 44:03.684
You wanna get into the VIP?
Get your own clients.

44:03.728 --> 44:07.732
The ones that come to see you,
and spend a lot of cash.

44:09.777 --> 44:11.649
Thanks, Missy.

44:11.692 --> 44:12.650
Forget it.

44:14.477 --> 44:16.044
Hmm.

44:16.088 --> 44:18.394
For me, the best way
to find new clients

44:18.438 --> 44:19.831
is to find a unicorn.

44:24.923 --> 44:26.707
That's my word for a guy
at the club

44:26.751 --> 44:28.448
who just wants a friend
to hang out with.

44:28.491 --> 44:30.493
- Hi, handsome.
- Hi.

44:30.537 --> 44:32.452
What're you doin' over here
all by yourself?

44:32.495 --> 44:34.149
You look like you need
a couple of bottles.

44:34.193 --> 44:36.412
Hmm? What do you think?
Two? Three?

44:36.456 --> 44:39.372
You look like you could handle
that. 500 hundred a bottle.

44:39.415 --> 44:42.157
You get the bottles
and I will get you friends.

44:49.556 --> 44:51.427
So they said, "How about
a two picture deal?"

44:51.471 --> 44:53.734
I said, "How about
a three picture deal?"

44:53.778 --> 44:55.214
And then...

45:05.572 --> 45:07.792
I'll get you boys some bottles.
Hmm?

45:07.835 --> 45:09.445
Yeah. Okay.

45:20.674 --> 45:22.676
All right, three, three,
you big boy.

45:22.720 --> 45:25.592
And, you,
I'm coming back for you.

45:40.694 --> 45:43.741
Hey, uh, Percy
wants to talk to you.

45:55.840 --> 45:57.885
You wanted to see me?

45:57.929 --> 46:01.802
I started at this club
as a bottle girl.

46:01.846 --> 46:03.021
Years ago.

46:03.064 --> 46:05.675
- Did you know that?
- No.

46:05.719 --> 46:09.810
And unlike the other girls,
I saved my money.

46:09.854 --> 46:11.725
Almost every penny.

46:12.770 --> 46:16.991
And then I invested
in stocks, land.

46:17.035 --> 46:19.211
Made even more money.

46:19.254 --> 46:20.778
And then I waited.

46:22.910 --> 46:25.521
When the previous owner,

46:25.565 --> 46:28.089
this scumbag
with lots of chest hair

46:28.133 --> 46:30.439
and way too much cologne...

46:30.483 --> 46:31.745
You know that nightmare?

46:31.789 --> 46:33.834
Yeah, there's several
here tonight.

46:33.878 --> 46:37.751
When he got arrested
for embezzlement,

46:37.795 --> 46:41.233
I had enough stashed away
to buy this whole club.

46:43.235 --> 46:46.325
You are not
like the other girls, Zoe.

46:47.282 --> 46:48.588
I'm not?

46:49.894 --> 46:53.114
You're hot,
and you've got brains.

46:53.158 --> 46:55.334
I like that, which is why

46:55.377 --> 46:57.771
I'm giving you a promotion.

46:59.599 --> 47:02.384
Now stop fidgeting.
You look terrific.

47:02.428 --> 47:05.779
Gotta say, Percy, I am not a fan
of the cheek-leak.

47:05.823 --> 47:08.869
Please, my cheek has leaked
many times.

47:08.913 --> 47:10.871
Take a deep breath.

47:10.915 --> 47:12.438
Just be yourself.

47:12.481 --> 47:14.875
You're gonna be just fine.

47:14.919 --> 47:16.877
You know, I think
you will do even better

47:16.921 --> 47:18.836
than Rachel in here.

47:20.881 --> 47:22.143
Thanks.

a bottle of tequila.

47:47.647 --> 47:49.083
Maybe two bottles of vodka

47:49.127 --> 47:50.824
and whatever else you think.

47:52.652 --> 47:54.654
Is there a problem?

47:57.091 --> 47:59.354
Zoe, right?

47:59.398 --> 48:01.269
I don't think
we've been formally introduced.

48:01.313 --> 48:03.402
I'm Richie Evans.

48:03.445 --> 48:05.621
- Zoe Herrington.
- Yeah.

48:05.665 --> 48:07.623
Said you'd be working here, I...

48:07.667 --> 48:09.408
I didn't think it was true.

48:09.451 --> 48:12.193
Surprise.

48:12.237 --> 48:13.368
It's just, it's so weird.

48:13.412 --> 48:15.631
In the good way. Good way.

48:15.675 --> 48:17.633
And you know,
I wanna say I was sorry

48:17.677 --> 48:20.288
for upsetting your mother
at the memorial service.

48:20.332 --> 48:22.595
You know, I...
can only imagine,

48:22.638 --> 48:24.466
you know,
what she's going through.

48:24.510 --> 48:25.815
I have two little girls
of my own.

48:25.859 --> 48:27.295
The thought of having
to say goodbye

48:27.339 --> 48:30.124
to one of them...

48:30.168 --> 48:31.821
Anyway, now, I-I just...

48:31.865 --> 48:32.997
I can't believe you're here.

48:33.040 --> 48:35.738
I didn't know
what I was missing.

48:35.782 --> 48:37.001
Richie!

48:37.044 --> 48:38.654
Pleasure to see you.
Thank you for coming.

48:38.698 --> 48:40.700
Absolutely. It's good to see ya.

48:41.962 --> 48:44.443
- See you around.
- All right.

48:44.486 --> 48:46.140
Seems like we will.

48:58.457 --> 49:00.372
Zoe.

49:02.461 --> 49:04.158
Hey.

49:04.202 --> 49:06.117
You want to make
some real money?

49:07.901 --> 49:08.989
What?

49:09.033 --> 49:11.644
I don't just run this club
for Percy.

49:11.687 --> 49:15.474
I got my own little
side thing going on.

49:15.517 --> 49:18.825
I'm what you call a facilitator.

49:18.868 --> 49:21.045
Wealthy men like to throw
after-parties, right?

49:21.088 --> 49:23.699
And they like to have beautiful
women at those parties.

49:23.743 --> 49:26.789
I have access
to beautiful women.

49:26.833 --> 49:30.402
Thing is,
beautiful women aren't free.

49:31.272 --> 49:34.623
Hmm... How much money?

49:34.667 --> 49:37.148
More than you can make here
in a week.

49:38.540 --> 49:40.064
Crazy.

49:40.107 --> 49:42.892
Richie's having a party
at his house tonight.

49:42.936 --> 49:45.069
He's personally asked
for you to come.

49:46.766 --> 49:50.726
What about his wife though,
right? Uh-oh.

49:50.770 --> 49:53.729
What Richie does
in his spare time is...

49:53.773 --> 49:56.558
none of his wife's business.

49:56.602 --> 49:58.299
Richie's a close
personal friend of mine.

49:58.343 --> 50:02.086
Discretion is valued
above all else in these circles.

50:04.610 --> 50:06.568
So, what, what kind
of party is it?

50:06.612 --> 50:08.744
- House party.
- Well, I know, you said that.

50:08.788 --> 50:12.661
But like what do I,
you know, do?

50:12.705 --> 50:14.315
You ask a lot of questions,
you know that?

50:14.359 --> 50:16.274
You want me to just tell him
you're unavailable?

50:16.317 --> 50:17.840
No, no, no, I...

50:17.884 --> 50:21.540
No, I'm just, you know, nervous.

50:21.583 --> 50:23.411
Don't be.

50:23.455 --> 50:25.674
You're his type.

50:25.718 --> 50:28.677
Just like Rachel was.

50:28.721 --> 50:30.375
This is the address.

50:30.418 --> 50:32.464
And how much I'll pay you.

50:34.466 --> 50:35.641
In cash.

50:36.468 --> 50:37.947
See you later.

50:57.532 --> 50:59.534
Mickey told me
to take care of you.

50:59.578 --> 51:02.233
- Here.
- What's this?

51:02.276 --> 51:04.844
Liquid courage.

51:07.325 --> 51:09.240
- Oh.
- Relax.

51:09.283 --> 51:11.633
It's not like I spiked it.

51:11.677 --> 51:13.461
It's rum and coke.

51:13.505 --> 51:15.507
Jeez, you need to loosen up.

51:16.247 --> 51:17.857
What?

51:19.380 --> 51:23.036
- Let go of my arm!
- Just keep walking.

51:23.080 --> 51:24.211
Let go!

51:24.255 --> 51:27.084
Just take your damn money
and get out.

51:27.127 --> 51:29.651
Be careful, 'cause what they're
doing in there is disgusting.

51:29.695 --> 51:31.044
Get her out of here. Now.

51:31.088 --> 51:33.873
- You're a pig.
- Have a nice night.

51:36.136 --> 51:38.182
Richie's gonna be really pleased
to see you.

51:38.225 --> 51:40.009
Okay.

51:41.185 --> 51:43.404
So lame.

51:43.448 --> 51:44.666
What is?

51:44.710 --> 51:47.539
- You.
- What?

51:47.582 --> 51:50.803
I do everything
Richie asks me to do.

51:50.846 --> 51:54.807
I bring him whatever
and whoever he wants.

51:56.374 --> 51:59.638
And he's never looked at me
the way he looked at Rachel.

52:00.987 --> 52:02.075
Or you.

52:03.120 --> 52:04.860
I'm sorry, uh...

52:04.904 --> 52:06.514
I'm sure you are.

52:10.170 --> 52:13.652
♪ Where have you been?

52:13.695 --> 52:15.523
May I take
your drink, miss?

52:15.567 --> 52:18.613
♪ Searching for

52:18.657 --> 52:20.789
- What're you doing here?
- We need to talk.

52:20.833 --> 52:24.053
- I can't tell you...
- Thank you. You can go.

52:24.097 --> 52:25.229
Yes, sir.

52:29.407 --> 52:31.104
I'm so glad you came.

52:31.148 --> 52:33.672
Yeah, me too.

52:33.715 --> 52:35.021
Let's get out of here.

52:36.240 --> 52:39.199
Get out of here?
It's your own house.

52:39.243 --> 52:40.809
Where're we goin'?

52:54.301 --> 52:55.781
This way.

52:57.435 --> 53:00.046
I'm starting to feel
a little lightheaded.

53:00.089 --> 53:02.744
- Maybe I should sit down.
- Well, we can go to my bedroom.

53:02.788 --> 53:05.573
You are a naughty boy.

53:05.617 --> 53:06.966
He is a naughty boy.

53:07.009 --> 53:09.098
I am not that kinda girl.

53:09.142 --> 53:12.798
I know, that's why
we're going this way.

53:15.453 --> 53:17.106
Just watch your step over here.

53:17.150 --> 53:20.153
- Yeah.
- It's down. There you go.

53:21.850 --> 53:25.637
- I gotcha. I gotcha.
- You know, I can do it.

53:25.680 --> 53:29.249
You know, I was thinking,
when we go down to the lake

53:29.293 --> 53:30.946
and we are out
to the middle of it.

53:30.990 --> 53:33.601
It's perfect 'cause I...

53:33.645 --> 53:36.909
really wanna
talk to you.

53:37.736 --> 53:39.999
You can always talk to me.

53:46.571 --> 53:48.137
You okay?

53:48.181 --> 53:51.924
I think
I've had too much.

53:51.967 --> 53:53.882
You just had one rum and coke.

53:54.753 --> 53:56.233
Why're you here?

54:00.193 --> 54:03.065
How'd you know
I had one rum and coke?

54:04.850 --> 54:08.070
Valerie...

54:08.897 --> 54:10.725
Rule number one,

54:10.769 --> 54:11.813
never take a drink from someone

54:11.857 --> 54:13.902
unless you've seen them pour it.

54:13.946 --> 54:16.905
Yeah, you'd know that
if you got this far.

54:16.949 --> 54:20.822
And Valerie, yes,
she, she gets this world.

54:20.866 --> 54:23.477
Rachel did too, she resented it.

54:23.521 --> 54:25.958
But she got it.

54:26.001 --> 54:28.395
And then, here you come,
little miss teacher

54:28.439 --> 54:30.005
tryin' to figure out
this entire world

54:30.049 --> 54:32.007
in just a couple of days
and it makes me think

54:32.051 --> 54:35.272
either you are
a great go-getter...

54:37.448 --> 54:39.363
or you're up to something.

54:42.931 --> 54:46.021
Shouldn't have kicked
the hornet's nest, Zoe.

54:46.065 --> 54:49.024
There's that
terrible metaphor again.

54:49.068 --> 54:51.113
We value discretion.

54:51.157 --> 54:53.246
And you are not discrete.

54:54.682 --> 54:58.512
Did you kill my sister?

54:58.556 --> 55:01.907
No. No. Hold on, hold on.

55:02.995 --> 55:05.519
No, I didn't kill her.

55:05.563 --> 55:07.739
But you I am gonna kill.

55:09.088 --> 55:11.177
And in case you're wondering,

55:11.220 --> 55:13.745
nobody knows you're out here.

55:13.788 --> 55:16.704
And anybody who does
know you're here...

55:16.748 --> 55:19.707
well, they wouldn't say
anything.

55:19.751 --> 55:23.581
And it'll be days before your
body washes up on that shore.

55:23.624 --> 55:26.279
Now, what's that old saying?

55:27.672 --> 55:30.327
Wealth by silence?

55:31.632 --> 55:33.417
And I'm a wealthy man.

56:33.128 --> 56:34.347
You're okay. You're okay.

57:17.434 --> 57:20.872
I know. The wall's
a bit obsessive.

57:20.915 --> 57:23.309
You feelin' okay?

57:23.352 --> 57:26.399
- Why... Where am I? What's...
- You're at my place.

57:26.443 --> 57:28.706
You're safe.
You, you were drugged.

57:28.749 --> 57:30.664
I checked your glass. Rohypnol.

57:30.708 --> 57:32.753
Heavy dosage.

57:32.797 --> 57:33.841
Someone wanted you out cold

57:33.885 --> 57:35.277
so you'd... peew,

57:35.321 --> 57:37.497
sink to the bottom
of that murky lake.

57:37.541 --> 57:40.544
Fortunately, good Samaritan
happen by.

57:40.587 --> 57:42.328
Saved your life.

57:43.677 --> 57:45.462
You're welcome.

57:45.505 --> 57:48.508
- What is all this?
- It's okay, you can trust me.

57:48.552 --> 57:50.336
- Let me just grab...
- What's there to trust you?

57:50.379 --> 57:52.730
I can't... I don't even know
what you were doing

57:52.773 --> 57:54.340
at that house.

58:03.871 --> 58:05.438
He was working for me.

58:10.443 --> 58:12.532
I tried to warn you, dummy.

58:12.576 --> 58:16.405
Didn't you see the signals
on your cocktail napkins?

58:16.449 --> 58:18.103
Told you, they were too vague.

58:19.147 --> 58:20.888
I'm your yin.

58:20.932 --> 58:22.455
And I'm your yang.

58:36.208 --> 58:38.819
You faked your own
suicide?

58:38.863 --> 58:40.865
Rachel...

58:40.908 --> 58:42.257
do you have any idea

58:42.301 --> 58:43.607
how serious this is?

58:43.650 --> 58:44.999
I'm sorry.

58:47.088 --> 58:48.829
I can only imagine what I put

58:48.873 --> 58:50.309
you and mom through.

58:51.615 --> 58:52.616
How is she?

58:54.008 --> 58:55.444
How is she?

58:57.011 --> 58:59.579
Rachel, she thinks
that your dead.

58:59.623 --> 59:01.102
We all thought

59:01.146 --> 59:02.713
that you were dead.

59:02.756 --> 59:06.499
We had a memorial service
for you. We...

59:06.543 --> 59:07.892
We have to call her.
We have to...

59:07.935 --> 59:09.937
No, this is important.

59:09.981 --> 59:12.984
You cannot tell mom. Not yet.

59:14.333 --> 59:15.987
Not until this is all finished.

59:16.030 --> 59:18.642
You want me to wait

59:18.685 --> 59:21.514
to tell our mother
that you're still alive?

59:22.820 --> 59:26.345
Do you have any idea
what you've put her through?

59:26.388 --> 59:28.086
Do you have any clue?

59:28.129 --> 59:30.044
We've been digging
through your journal

59:30.088 --> 59:31.437
to try to figure
this whole thing out.

59:31.480 --> 59:32.786
There's these-these pages

59:32.830 --> 59:34.135
that are torn out at the end...

59:34.179 --> 59:36.181
That's because
I ripped them out.

59:37.486 --> 59:39.663
I started to get paranoid
that he'd learned

59:39.706 --> 59:40.794
I was writing it all down.

59:40.838 --> 59:43.492
"He" who? Richie?

59:43.536 --> 59:45.277
Mickey.

59:45.320 --> 59:47.888
It looks like her confused face.

59:47.932 --> 59:51.979
Why don't I pick up where
the pages left off?

59:52.023 --> 59:54.068
Yeah, I think
that's a good idea.

59:58.725 --> 01:00:01.162
"I never wanted to know
the truth about what Mickey

01:00:01.206 --> 01:00:02.990
was doing with Richie.

01:00:03.034 --> 01:00:05.036
But I had my suspicions
when Richie sent

01:00:05.079 --> 01:00:07.386
his right-hand man,
Larry, to pick me up

01:00:07.429 --> 01:00:11.129
and bring me over
to his after-party.

01:00:11.172 --> 01:00:13.479
I went along.
No questions asked.

01:00:13.522 --> 01:00:17.526
I played dumb, kept quiet.

01:00:17.570 --> 01:00:20.442
I was paid a lot of money
to party with Richie.

01:00:21.966 --> 01:00:24.577
I'll admit it,
the money was extraordinary

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:27.885
and that first night
in the house,

01:00:27.928 --> 01:00:29.234
we...

01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:34.413
I knew he was married

01:00:34.456 --> 01:00:36.763
and that I was insane

01:00:36.807 --> 01:00:38.809
and that it was insane.

01:00:38.852 --> 01:00:40.985
But there I was.

01:00:41.028 --> 01:00:43.596
I've never done anything
like that before.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.772
Ever.

01:00:45.816 --> 01:00:47.513
But I kept going back.

01:00:52.083 --> 01:00:54.128
I kept getting paid.

01:00:55.173 --> 01:00:56.609
And I kept quiet.

01:01:02.267 --> 01:01:03.529
Even though Richie tried to keep

01:01:03.572 --> 01:01:05.052
what he was doing away from me

01:01:05.096 --> 01:01:07.054
I saw things,

01:01:07.098 --> 01:01:09.056
but I never asked him about it.

01:01:09.100 --> 01:01:11.711
The money was too good."

01:01:11.755 --> 01:01:14.888
I had something to tell you.
What was it?

01:01:14.932 --> 01:01:16.498
I, uh...

01:01:16.542 --> 01:01:18.587
"Then one day
he told me he loved me."

01:01:18.631 --> 01:01:20.415
I love you.

01:01:20.459 --> 01:01:21.895
"And I believed him."

01:01:21.939 --> 01:01:24.158
I love you, too.

01:01:24.202 --> 01:01:25.377
"Like a fool.

01:01:26.247 --> 01:01:27.858
Because I did love him."

01:01:27.901 --> 01:01:28.859
Gentlemen...

01:01:32.297 --> 01:01:33.994
I was with Richie now.

01:01:34.038 --> 01:01:35.387
I was his girl.

01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:37.302
I wasn't getting paid anymore

01:01:37.345 --> 01:01:40.435
but the parties at his house
continued.

01:01:40.479 --> 01:01:43.221
And I kept quiet.

01:01:43.264 --> 01:01:44.744
Mickey kept bringing
new bottle girls

01:01:44.788 --> 01:01:46.746
to Richie's house.

01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:49.531
They were lied to,
they were told

01:01:49.575 --> 01:01:52.143
this was the way
to a modeling career.

01:01:54.928 --> 01:01:58.758
Once they were in, they had
no reason to get out.

01:01:58.802 --> 01:02:00.673
The money was too good.

01:02:02.806 --> 01:02:06.070
Which is how these men were
able to get the girls high.

01:02:06.113 --> 01:02:08.246
Made them vulnerable.

01:02:08.289 --> 01:02:10.248
But still, I stayed quiet.

01:02:10.291 --> 01:02:12.250
I stayed quiet
even when I found out

01:02:12.293 --> 01:02:14.426
Lolo wasn't just a promoter.

01:02:14.469 --> 01:02:16.428
He had a side deal with Mickey.

01:02:16.471 --> 01:02:18.256
He brought girls in
from all over.

01:02:18.299 --> 01:02:21.128
Russia, Mexico, Ukraine.

01:02:21.172 --> 01:02:23.740
Mickey got them to work
as bottle girls at first.

01:02:23.783 --> 01:02:26.786
That kept it legit.
He promised them a better life.

01:02:26.830 --> 01:02:28.919
But Mickey was just weeding out
the vulnerable ones.

01:02:28.962 --> 01:02:32.009
The desperate ones. The ones
hardest up for money.

01:02:32.052 --> 01:02:34.881
Those are the ones
that he brought to the house.

01:02:34.925 --> 01:02:36.143
And then we come into this house

01:02:36.187 --> 01:02:37.405
and they were selecting
the girls

01:02:37.449 --> 01:02:39.712
like fruit
from the grocery store.

01:02:41.366 --> 01:02:43.803
They were paying him
for the girls.

01:02:43.847 --> 01:02:45.370
They were paying Richie.

01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:50.201
Most of them were drugged.

01:02:50.244 --> 01:02:52.290
The guys didn't care.

01:02:53.726 --> 01:02:56.294
God, it was disgusting.
It was so vile.

01:02:57.556 --> 01:03:00.777
And this man that
I thought that I loved...

01:03:02.909 --> 01:03:03.954
he was...

01:03:06.391 --> 01:03:08.393
he was in charge of all of it.

01:03:10.874 --> 01:03:13.528
When I finally confronted
Richie about it,

01:03:13.572 --> 01:03:16.662
he lost his mind. I thought
he was going to kill me.

01:03:16.705 --> 01:03:18.838
And he told me that he would
if I told anybody.

01:03:18.882 --> 01:03:22.973
And then, when I told
him I was leaving him,

01:03:23.016 --> 01:03:25.845
he said, "No, you're not.

01:03:25.889 --> 01:03:28.282
You can't leave.
You're my girl.

01:03:28.326 --> 01:03:29.762
You're not going anywhere."

01:03:31.111 --> 01:03:32.765
Later that night, Larry,

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:35.202
who had started feeling bad
for me pulled me aside.

01:03:35.246 --> 01:03:38.379
You see, I had been journaling
everything I was seeing.

01:03:38.423 --> 01:03:40.468
Everything.
And Mickey found out.

01:03:40.512 --> 01:03:42.906
So, of course, he told Richie.

01:03:46.039 --> 01:03:48.868
Which meant I'd become
a problem for Richie.

01:03:48.912 --> 01:03:52.002
Larry warned me that Richie
was going to kill me

01:03:52.045 --> 01:03:53.351
that very night.

01:03:53.394 --> 01:03:55.396
He told me I had to run

01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:58.051
as soon as I could.

01:03:58.095 --> 01:04:00.140
Of course, had Richie found
out Larry was texting me

01:04:00.184 --> 01:04:02.751
all that info,
he would have killed us both.

01:04:04.449 --> 01:04:05.624
I was terrified, Zoe.

01:04:05.667 --> 01:04:07.278
I've never been that scared.

01:04:07.321 --> 01:04:08.757
I was desperate.

01:04:13.023 --> 01:04:14.676
I needed a miracle.

01:04:16.504 --> 01:04:18.593
That's when I heard
somebody coming.

01:04:18.637 --> 01:04:20.073
I thought it was Richie.

01:04:20.117 --> 01:04:21.422
It wasn't.

01:04:41.965 --> 01:04:43.314
Poor girl.

01:04:44.141 --> 01:04:45.403
She overdosed.

01:04:45.446 --> 01:04:47.448
It was horrible.

01:04:47.492 --> 01:04:48.797
She was from Columbia, I think.

01:04:48.841 --> 01:04:50.887
Died right there,
in front of me.

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:01.114
I knew Richie
would come for me soon.

01:05:01.158 --> 01:05:02.724
I didn't have much time.

01:05:08.992 --> 01:05:11.211
Now, before you judge me
on this next part,

01:05:11.255 --> 01:05:14.954
remember, I was desperate.

01:05:14.998 --> 01:05:16.956
Desperate enough to notice
that she and I

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.392
were the same size.

01:05:32.754 --> 01:05:34.974
So, I switched dresses with her

01:05:35.018 --> 01:05:36.454
and I moved quickly.

01:05:55.821 --> 01:05:59.520
Oh, God, forgive me.
What am I doing?

01:06:23.109 --> 01:06:24.197
Oh, my God.

01:06:24.241 --> 01:06:25.720
Rachel!

01:06:25.764 --> 01:06:27.766
- Rachel!
- No, no, no.

01:06:27.809 --> 01:06:29.289
It's too late. It's too late.

01:06:29.333 --> 01:06:30.987
There's nothing you can do.

01:06:32.205 --> 01:06:33.163
Rachel!

01:07:05.369 --> 01:07:07.545
That poor girl.

01:07:07.588 --> 01:07:09.764
I could've warned her.

01:07:09.808 --> 01:07:12.463
I should have warned her,
but I...

01:07:12.506 --> 01:07:14.726
kept quiet.

01:07:16.597 --> 01:07:19.383
Oh, God. I kept quiet.

01:07:19.426 --> 01:07:20.906
But as morbid as it sounds,

01:07:20.949 --> 01:07:21.950
you know, she...

01:07:23.300 --> 01:07:25.041
She saved my life.

01:07:27.826 --> 01:07:29.436
It's only a matter of time
before they discovered

01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:34.267
that that body wasn't mine.
Do dental records or something.

01:07:34.311 --> 01:07:38.619
And it's like a ticking clock.
That's why I hired Vince.

01:07:38.663 --> 01:07:41.361
He was one of my clients.

01:07:41.405 --> 01:07:42.667
A unicorn.

01:07:42.710 --> 01:07:45.365
Um, I know what that is now.

01:07:45.409 --> 01:07:48.629
You're some kind of
private eye investigator.

01:07:48.673 --> 01:07:50.718
Uh, not "Some kind of."

01:07:50.762 --> 01:07:52.633
I was doing recon at the club,

01:07:52.677 --> 01:07:55.984
trying to get Rachel's
phone back from the house.

01:07:56.028 --> 01:07:57.029
Rachel's phone.

01:07:58.770 --> 01:08:00.293
Yeah, Larry and I
had been texting

01:08:00.337 --> 01:08:01.425
those last few days.

01:08:02.991 --> 01:08:05.864
And he confirmed everything
about Richie.

01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:15.613
Since he could track me
with the phone

01:08:15.656 --> 01:08:16.962
I stashed it...

01:08:19.182 --> 01:08:20.747
and ran.

01:08:21.880 --> 01:08:23.490
It's all the evidence we need

01:08:23.533 --> 01:08:25.536
to show what
Richie's been doing.

01:08:25.578 --> 01:08:26.928
Isn't it all on the cloud?

01:08:26.971 --> 01:08:29.060
You don't need
the actual device?

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:30.497
Richie got me
that phone.

01:08:30.541 --> 01:08:31.585
It's all in his account

01:08:31.629 --> 01:08:32.846
and only a few select people

01:08:32.890 --> 01:08:35.285
in a circle had that number.

01:08:35.328 --> 01:08:36.850
Larry was one of them.

01:08:36.895 --> 01:08:38.549
Which is how Richie found out

01:08:38.591 --> 01:08:40.464
Larry was talking
to you and your mom

01:08:40.506 --> 01:08:44.032
and Rachel, he read the texts.

01:08:44.076 --> 01:08:47.166
So then, Richie really did
kill Larry.

01:08:47.210 --> 01:08:49.560
Actually, it was his goon
that killed Larry.

01:08:49.603 --> 01:08:51.518
Held his head under water.

01:08:51.562 --> 01:08:53.477
Richie just watched.

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:56.871
Zoe, we have to get
that phone back.

01:08:56.915 --> 01:08:59.135
It's what we need

01:08:59.178 --> 01:09:00.439
to take them down

01:09:00.484 --> 01:09:01.788
Yes, it does.

01:09:01.832 --> 01:09:03.269
I just worked my way
in the house last night

01:09:03.313 --> 01:09:05.880
to get it, when you showed up
to take a dip.

01:09:05.924 --> 01:09:09.884
So, I have to break
in there, tonight.

01:09:09.928 --> 01:09:12.060
Oh, my God, this is...

01:09:12.104 --> 01:09:14.062
Wow, this... I'm sorry,
but this is

01:09:14.106 --> 01:09:16.326
such a Michael Connelly story.

01:09:16.368 --> 01:09:17.544
- Uh...
- Who?

01:09:17.587 --> 01:09:19.198
Michael Connelly, the...

01:09:19.242 --> 01:09:20.808
the crime novels
that I've been sending you

01:09:20.852 --> 01:09:22.375
that you haven't been reading.

01:09:22.419 --> 01:09:26.510
Sorry, I've been busy
in Atlanta's seedy underworld.

01:09:26.553 --> 01:09:30.383
Right, okay. So then,
what's the plan?

01:09:30.426 --> 01:09:33.037
What... When are we
gonna head to his house?

01:09:33.908 --> 01:09:35.345
- We?
- What?

01:09:35.388 --> 01:09:38.304
You-you thought
you were gonna do this alone?

01:09:38.348 --> 01:09:40.045
- Yeah.
- Come on.

01:09:40.087 --> 01:09:41.394
You've been to Richie's house.

01:09:41.438 --> 01:09:43.091
It's like a, a hexagon, uhh..

01:09:43.135 --> 01:09:44.702
and there's, you know,
the rooms.

01:09:44.745 --> 01:09:45.920
You're never
gonna be able to find

01:09:45.964 --> 01:09:47.747
his bedroom without wasting time

01:09:47.792 --> 01:09:49.662
and you're gonna
risk getting caught.

01:09:49.707 --> 01:09:50.969
I mean, Rachel,
I mean, she knows

01:09:51.011 --> 01:09:53.406
where Richie's bedroom is,
but she's dead.

01:09:53.450 --> 01:09:55.365
So that just leaves me.

01:09:55.408 --> 01:09:57.018
They think you're dead, too.

01:09:58.281 --> 01:10:00.718
I'm really sorry,
I'm not like you.

01:10:03.329 --> 01:10:04.896
I'm going with you.

01:10:11.337 --> 01:10:12.643
Mom?

01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:31.227
Mom.

01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:32.837
Zoe.

01:10:34.317 --> 01:10:35.970
Oh, thank God.

01:10:36.710 --> 01:10:37.885
Oh.

01:10:40.148 --> 01:10:42.107
I had the worst dream.

01:10:42.150 --> 01:10:44.805
I thought you left me all alone.

01:10:44.849 --> 01:10:47.721
Mom, I'm, I'm here. It's okay.

01:10:47.765 --> 01:10:51.072
I'm sorry.

01:10:51.116 --> 01:10:53.771
I'm just so scared
I'm gonna lose you, too.

01:10:53.814 --> 01:10:56.948
You're not. Mom, you're not
gonna lose me.

01:10:58.689 --> 01:11:00.343
And I never should have left.

01:11:00.386 --> 01:11:03.433
I never should've left
you and Rachel and I'm sorry.

01:11:03.476 --> 01:11:05.609
Oh, no. Shh. That was my fault.

01:11:05.652 --> 01:11:07.741
I was unhappy
and I took it out on you

01:11:07.785 --> 01:11:09.830
and that's just not fair.

01:11:11.789 --> 01:11:14.052
I think that we're all
gonna be okay.

01:11:15.488 --> 01:11:16.707
I do.

01:11:23.061 --> 01:11:24.323
Try and stay quiet.

01:11:24.367 --> 01:11:25.672
Last night,
I left the back door open.

01:11:25.716 --> 01:11:27.195
Get in, get the phone, get out.

01:11:27.239 --> 01:11:29.285
Yeah, I know, I know.
I got it.

01:11:32.070 --> 01:11:33.941
Shh!
Just find the phone.

01:11:33.985 --> 01:11:36.509
Okay, here.
This is Richie's bedroom.

01:11:36.553 --> 01:11:38.294
Okay, Rachel said
it was behind the bed.

01:11:38.337 --> 01:11:41.471
I'm gonna look
under the mattress. Here.

01:11:41.514 --> 01:11:43.037
You start with
the master bedroom.

01:11:43.081 --> 01:11:44.996
It's just down the hall
to the right.

01:11:45.039 --> 01:11:46.911
Hurry it up, please.

01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:12.284
I was wondering until
you're done...

01:12:16.723 --> 01:12:18.508
Where'd you find this?

01:13:00.637 --> 01:13:02.769
- Had we not gone to you...
- You knew there was a chance...

01:13:02.813 --> 01:13:04.118
that the phone
wouldn't be there,

01:13:04.162 --> 01:13:05.250
that they would've
already taken it.

01:13:05.293 --> 01:13:06.382
That's why there was a plan B.

01:13:06.425 --> 01:13:07.948
- You knew that.
- Plan B sucks.

01:13:07.992 --> 01:13:10.777
Wait, whoa, what's plan B?

01:13:10.821 --> 01:13:11.996
You might as well tell her,
I mean,

01:13:12.039 --> 01:13:13.998
she's obviously
part of the team now.

01:13:15.347 --> 01:13:16.783
Percy is plan B.

01:13:16.827 --> 01:13:19.699
Percy? P-Percy,
the owner of the club?

01:13:19.743 --> 01:13:22.223
She has no idea what
Mickey's up to.

01:13:24.008 --> 01:13:25.444
And Percy would never
get mixed up

01:13:25.488 --> 01:13:28.447
in something like that,
and she's worked too hard

01:13:28.491 --> 01:13:29.579
to make that club her own.

01:13:29.622 --> 01:13:31.189
Yes, but she's
not gonna believe me.

01:13:31.232 --> 01:13:32.886
She has no reason to.

01:13:32.930 --> 01:13:34.497
Right. So that's why
that plan sucks. Okay.

01:13:34.540 --> 01:13:35.976
Oh, no, that's not why it sucks.

01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:37.891
Well, guess what?
She will believe her if...

01:13:37.935 --> 01:13:40.981
If we can get our hands
on Mickey's ledger.

01:13:41.025 --> 01:13:44.071
He records notes, names,

01:13:44.115 --> 01:13:45.856
all his business dealings
in there.

01:13:45.899 --> 01:13:47.466
And it's enough information
to put him

01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:48.641
and Richie away for life.

01:13:48.685 --> 01:13:50.469
And that's why plan B sucks.

01:13:50.513 --> 01:13:52.993
Wait, I don't know why, why does
that suck? That doesn't suck.

01:13:53.037 --> 01:13:55.126
That's a classic
crime novel McGuffin.

01:13:55.169 --> 01:13:56.475
A ledger with
all the incriminating evidence?

01:13:56.519 --> 01:13:58.216
- I mean, come on!
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:13:58.259 --> 01:13:59.609
Except this isn't like some
novel of you download

01:13:59.652 --> 01:14:01.132
on your Kindle to read
during your summer break

01:14:01.175 --> 01:14:02.655
from your real job as a teacher.

01:14:02.699 --> 01:14:04.614
Easy, Vince.

01:14:04.657 --> 01:14:06.267
Easy? You want me...

01:14:06.311 --> 01:14:08.182
You want me
to take it easy, Rachel?

01:14:08.226 --> 01:14:09.749
Mickey's not gonna just
hand us the ledger,

01:14:09.793 --> 01:14:11.664
which means we have
to physically take it from him.

01:14:11.708 --> 01:14:13.710
Hence, plan B sucks.

01:14:13.753 --> 01:14:16.974
What is your problem? Seriously!

01:14:17.017 --> 01:14:18.976
I-I don't know
why you're doing this.

01:14:19.019 --> 01:14:20.456
I know why we're doing this,
but I don't know

01:14:20.499 --> 01:14:22.022
why you're doing this, and if
you have some kind

01:14:22.066 --> 01:14:24.329
of problem just go, okay?
We got this.

01:14:24.372 --> 01:14:26.766
- This is personal for us.
- Zoey...

01:14:26.810 --> 01:14:30.901
Vincent's sister got wrapped up
in this world last year.

01:14:30.944 --> 01:14:33.338
Different club.

01:14:33.381 --> 01:14:38.038
She got involved with the wrong
guys, then ended up for sale.

01:14:38.082 --> 01:14:39.866
He hadn't heard from her
in a while so

01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:42.782
he went to her apartment and...

01:14:42.826 --> 01:14:45.132
found her body,
she had overdosed.

01:14:50.311 --> 01:14:53.532
So, um, this is personal
for me, too.

01:14:55.665 --> 01:15:00.278
So, are we good?
Are we, uh, gonna do this?

01:15:01.105 --> 01:15:02.193
- Yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

01:15:02.236 --> 01:15:04.630
So, what we do know is

01:15:04.674 --> 01:15:06.893
Mickey never parts ways
with that ledger.

01:15:06.937 --> 01:15:08.895
So, that's a good thing
because then we always know

01:15:08.939 --> 01:15:10.288
where it is at all times.

01:15:10.331 --> 01:15:11.942
And if we can pull this off
tonight

01:15:11.985 --> 01:15:13.291
it would be a two-fer.

01:15:13.334 --> 01:15:15.249
Richie's at the club on Fridays.

01:15:15.293 --> 01:15:17.251
We can take them
both down tonight.

01:15:17.295 --> 01:15:19.776
Yeah, the tricky part's going
to be getting into the club.

01:15:19.819 --> 01:15:21.342
You both...

01:15:21.386 --> 01:15:23.519
Journey to
the impregnable fortress.

01:15:23.562 --> 01:15:25.042
Classic heist trope.

01:15:28.785 --> 01:15:29.829
Sorry. Go on.

01:15:29.873 --> 01:15:31.918
You two are supposed to be dead,

01:15:31.962 --> 01:15:34.138
so the moment you're caught,
jig's up.

01:15:35.008 --> 01:15:36.183
Yeah, I thought about that.

01:15:36.227 --> 01:15:39.709
Um, I think I have a way in.

01:15:43.974 --> 01:15:45.715
Hey, make sure
you close the door behind you.

01:15:45.758 --> 01:15:48.108
Lolo's taken
so many girls and clients

01:15:48.152 --> 01:15:49.196
for the house to the club

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:51.329
he does it all by rote now.

01:15:52.243 --> 01:15:53.810
So, I'm betting he won't notice

01:15:53.853 --> 01:15:56.334
if I switched
with one of those girls.

01:15:58.815 --> 01:16:01.992
Hey, thanks for that.
Believe me, you dodged a bullet.

01:16:05.996 --> 01:16:07.606
Hey, Porsche.

01:16:07.650 --> 01:16:09.303
Yeah, yeah.
I got a couple of girls.

01:16:09.347 --> 01:16:11.262
One's Puerto Rican
and the other one's Chinese.

01:16:15.353 --> 01:16:16.789
I think I know a way in.

01:16:16.833 --> 01:16:19.226
I'm just gonna
have to get gussied up first.

01:16:20.619 --> 01:16:21.577
Me, too.

01:16:25.232 --> 01:16:27.147
Hey, what're you doing?

01:16:28.975 --> 01:16:31.238
I have been a reader
my whole life,

01:16:31.282 --> 01:16:33.110
but I've never written anything.

01:16:34.241 --> 01:16:35.721
I'm going back to the club

01:16:35.765 --> 01:16:37.897
for one last time.

01:16:37.941 --> 01:16:39.595
- Zoe, please don't go back.
- Mom...

01:16:39.638 --> 01:16:41.379
- Let me call Percy...
- No..

01:16:41.422 --> 01:16:44.600
- And tell her...
- Mom, no.

01:16:44.643 --> 01:16:46.036
I'm doing this.

01:16:56.524 --> 01:16:59.745
Oh, yes, hello.
This is Barbara Herrington.

01:16:59.789 --> 01:17:01.834
Rachel Herrington's mother.

01:17:01.878 --> 01:17:03.227
Do you have a moment?

01:17:15.543 --> 01:17:17.371
Oh, my God, Zoe.

01:17:17.415 --> 01:17:20.070
You're all right!
I was so worried.

01:17:20.113 --> 01:17:21.680
Look, I don't know
what Richie told you,

01:17:21.724 --> 01:17:24.683
but he and Mickey are mixed up
in some horrible things.

01:17:26.206 --> 01:17:27.468
Yeah, I know.

01:17:29.079 --> 01:17:30.297
I'm here to stop them.

01:17:30.341 --> 01:17:31.951
Oh, my God. I'm so glad.

01:17:31.995 --> 01:17:33.692
Look, no one will be
in the kitchen right now,

01:17:33.736 --> 01:17:36.608
so why don't you come in
and tell me the whole plan?

01:17:45.704 --> 01:17:46.966
Hm?

01:17:47.010 --> 01:17:50.709
Oh, you know, I would love
an olive in this.

01:17:51.971 --> 01:17:53.669
- Do you mind?
- Nope.

01:17:59.457 --> 01:18:01.764
- Perfect.
- Of course.

01:18:01.807 --> 01:18:05.811
So, tell me everything
you know about Richie.

01:18:19.477 --> 01:18:21.305
The latest and greatest.

01:18:21.348 --> 01:18:22.872
You never cease to amaze me.

01:18:22.915 --> 01:18:26.223
Ladies, he's a very important
friend of mine.

01:18:26.266 --> 01:18:29.617
Very powerful, very connected.

01:18:29.661 --> 01:18:31.315
He'll help you out.
Treat him well.

01:18:31.358 --> 01:18:34.144
Mickey! Mickey! Let go of me!

01:18:34.187 --> 01:18:35.580
Mickey!

01:18:36.799 --> 01:18:38.757
What are you doing?

01:18:38.801 --> 01:18:41.847
I've come to
warn all of the ladies

01:18:41.891 --> 01:18:44.545
about you and about him.

01:18:46.634 --> 01:18:47.548
Oh.

01:18:51.857 --> 01:18:55.121
Oopsies. Was that spike drink
meant for me, too?

01:18:56.993 --> 01:18:58.298
Val...

01:19:00.431 --> 01:19:03.564
Ooh, but thank you
for the olives.

01:19:05.131 --> 01:19:06.611
You're gonna regret this.

01:19:06.654 --> 01:19:09.353
I swear to God
I'm gonna get you outside.

01:19:11.137 --> 01:19:13.226
Move! What are you doing?

01:19:13.270 --> 01:19:15.925
What is it that you told me
once about a bottle of champagne

01:19:15.968 --> 01:19:19.493
A bottle of champagne
is like a weapon.

01:19:19.537 --> 01:19:20.538
Jack!

01:19:24.847 --> 01:19:26.544
Go get that girl back.

01:20:49.409 --> 01:20:51.411
Police. You're under arrest.

01:20:51.455 --> 01:20:53.544
Kurt Vonnegut one said,

01:20:53.587 --> 01:20:54.980
"Find a subject you care about

01:20:55.024 --> 01:20:57.287
and which you in your heart
feel others

01:20:57.330 --> 01:20:58.462
should care about."

01:20:58.505 --> 01:21:00.072
Drop it. Now.

01:21:00.116 --> 01:21:03.728
For me, that person
is my sister, Rachel.

01:21:03.771 --> 01:21:06.470
She ended up falling in love
with the wrong guy,

01:21:06.513 --> 01:21:09.255
somebody dangerous.

01:21:09.299 --> 01:21:10.517
Rachel went into hiding

01:21:10.561 --> 01:21:12.911
searching for evidence
to put him away.

01:21:12.955 --> 01:21:14.957
And when she found
that evidence,

01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:17.089
she looked him in the eye

01:21:17.133 --> 01:21:20.484
and she never had to hide
from anyone again in her life.

01:21:23.182 --> 01:21:24.662
The end.

01:21:27.665 --> 01:21:29.101
Well, it turns out
Mickey's ledger

01:21:29.145 --> 01:21:32.409
was the hail-Mary pass
we all hoped it would be.

01:21:32.452 --> 01:21:34.150
You wrote down everything.

01:21:34.193 --> 01:21:36.413
You're an idiot.

01:21:36.456 --> 01:21:39.459
An organized idiot.
But an idiot.

01:21:39.503 --> 01:21:41.809
You'll find everything
you need in here.

01:21:41.853 --> 01:21:44.073
Plus, we have several
eye witnesses willing to testify

01:21:44.116 --> 01:21:46.510
against him and Richie.

01:21:47.946 --> 01:21:49.513
Oh, and also

01:21:49.556 --> 01:21:52.037
uh, there's a co-conspirator
currently passed out

01:21:52.081 --> 01:21:54.648
in your kitchen who, I'm sure,
would take a deal

01:21:54.692 --> 01:21:56.389
in order to save her own ass.

01:21:56.433 --> 01:21:58.174
Don't forget about this one.

01:21:58.217 --> 01:22:00.480
He and I had a little chat.

01:22:00.524 --> 01:22:03.440
He's willing to tell you
everything he knows.

01:22:03.483 --> 01:22:04.963
- Isn't that right?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:22:05.007 --> 01:22:07.661
I'm a witness, I'm a witness.
I'm just a witness.

01:22:07.705 --> 01:22:11.056
This is the name and the address
of the girl.

01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:12.928
She was my miracle.

01:22:12.971 --> 01:22:14.407
I'm sure her family
would appreciate

01:22:14.451 --> 01:22:15.713
knowing what happened to her.

01:22:15.756 --> 01:22:17.671
I'll make sure I go myself.

01:22:19.021 --> 01:22:20.500
Oh...

01:22:20.544 --> 01:22:23.112
I took the liberty
of calling your wife.

01:22:23.155 --> 01:22:24.722
Turns out she didn't know
anything about your

01:22:24.765 --> 01:22:27.507
country house
or your little side business.

01:22:27.551 --> 01:22:28.987
She seemed really angry.

01:22:29.031 --> 01:22:30.641
Screamed on the phone
something about her lawyer

01:22:30.684 --> 01:22:32.991
and taking all of your money.

01:22:33.035 --> 01:22:34.688
No one is gonna
be quiet anymore.

01:22:49.486 --> 01:22:51.270
- Way to go, little sis.
- Mm-hm.

01:22:51.314 --> 01:22:53.272
Calling the cops?
That wasn't part of our plan.

01:22:53.316 --> 01:22:54.708
When'd do that?

01:22:54.752 --> 01:22:57.146
- I didn't.
- What?
