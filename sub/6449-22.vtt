[male narrator]
Previously on "Smallville.."

00:03.829 --> 00:05.266
I could have swore I hit you.

00:05.309 --> 00:07.659
So, what are you,
man or Superman?

00:07.703 --> 00:09.487
I haven't figured it out yet.

00:09.531 --> 00:12.316
[Jor-El]
You are the last son
of Krypton.

00:12.360 --> 00:13.578
[Clark]
What are you
trying to tell me, dad?

00:13.622 --> 00:15.015
That I'm from another planet?

00:15.058 --> 00:17.104
- Who are you?
- Lois Lane.

00:17.147 --> 00:18.844
[Jimmy]
I've seen the way
you two look at each other.

00:18.888 --> 00:20.759
Lois and Clark
would be great together.

00:20.803 --> 00:23.197
You're looking at the newest
recruit to the "Daily Planet."

00:23.240 --> 00:26.287
To me, you're more than just
a hero. You're a superhero.

00:26.330 --> 00:28.985
I am the villain of this story.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.509
- Lionel's here.
- I'm not the Lionel you knew.

00:31.553 --> 00:33.859
- Lex is dead.
- That is a lie.

00:33.903 --> 00:36.601
[Tess]
You're all engineered
from Lex's DNA.

00:36.645 --> 00:38.516
When I sent the Kandorians
away, I opened a door

00:38.560 --> 00:40.475
for something else
to come to Earth.

00:40.518 --> 00:43.086
It preys upon the dark side
that we already have.

00:43.130 --> 00:45.436
[Desaad]
Our unholy trinity is complete

00:45.480 --> 00:47.351
preparing the way
for Lord Darkseid.

00:47.395 --> 00:49.353
I think the Omega
is a sign of corruption.

00:49.397 --> 00:51.660
A mark that the darkness
has fully taken over someone.

00:51.703 --> 00:54.097
If we can't stop it,
the darkness will infect

00:54.141 --> 00:56.099
every person on this planet.

00:56.143 --> 00:58.319
You could be the greatest hero
the world has ever known.

00:58.362 --> 01:00.103
[Clark]
Not according to Jor-El.

01:00.147 --> 01:02.540
Well, then, do what you
do best, prove him wrong.

01:02.584 --> 01:04.107
[Clark]
You may not see me as a hero

01:04.151 --> 01:05.848
but the rest of the world does!

01:05.891 --> 01:07.328
And I decide my fate!

01:07.371 --> 01:09.895
[Jor-El]
Your journey is far from over.

01:09.939 --> 01:11.854
Goodbye, Jor-El.

01:11.897 --> 01:14.596
[male narrator]
And now the series
finale of "Smallville."

01:24.388 --> 01:26.434
It's good to have you back.

01:30.002 --> 01:31.917
I should have guessed
it would be you.

01:31.961 --> 01:33.441
No, no. No, no, no.

01:33.484 --> 01:35.486
Don't beat yourself up, Tess.

01:35.530 --> 01:37.619
I've been watching you
very closely.

01:37.662 --> 01:40.578
- Oh.
- I'm impressed.

01:40.622 --> 01:43.015
I must admit.

01:43.059 --> 01:45.148
I underestimated you.

01:46.845 --> 01:48.760
It's a little late, huh?

01:48.804 --> 01:50.719
It's not really time
for a father-daughter chat.

01:50.762 --> 01:53.678
There's literally a planet
hurtling toward Earth.

01:55.289 --> 02:00.294
Do I catch the tiniest hint
of a doubt?

02:00.337 --> 02:04.254
Are you worried that your savior
in red might not prevail?

02:05.473 --> 02:07.605
- He needs me.
- Wrong.

02:07.649 --> 02:09.825
He needs no one.

02:09.868 --> 02:12.175
I've seen what he's capable of.

02:17.528 --> 02:19.661
I-it's ironic, I'm the only one

02:19.704 --> 02:21.619
who seems to believe
in him, isn't it?

02:23.839 --> 02:26.363
Don't question
where my allegiance lies.

02:28.496 --> 02:31.847
It's time you embrace
your lineage, Tess.

02:31.890 --> 02:34.632
Time to become the Luthor
you were destined to be.

02:36.025 --> 02:37.766
Why did you bring me here?

02:37.809 --> 02:40.421
My son, Lex

02:40.464 --> 02:43.815
your brother, a genius

02:43.859 --> 02:46.557
carried on
with the family business.

02:46.601 --> 02:48.907
As you know..

02:48.951 --> 02:52.520
...Lex cloned himself.

02:52.563 --> 02:54.957
There were many clones.

02:55.000 --> 02:58.134
None of them were perfect,
but some of the pieces were.

03:01.311 --> 03:03.531
No.

03:03.574 --> 03:05.489
Yes.

03:05.533 --> 03:07.448
Lex took the best pieces

03:07.491 --> 03:09.972
and grafted them
into a masterwork.

03:11.539 --> 03:13.802
- I don't believe you.
- 'Of course you don't.'

03:13.845 --> 03:16.761
Lex is a visionary. You're not.

03:17.806 --> 03:19.242
Where is he, then?

03:19.286 --> 03:22.376
He'll reveal himself
when he's ready.

03:24.421 --> 03:26.597
It's not possible.

03:26.641 --> 03:28.251
Well, there is one thing

03:28.295 --> 03:32.081
Lex wasn't able to
duplicate successfully.

03:33.691 --> 03:36.738
Lex is missing a heart.

03:36.781 --> 03:38.392
And who better to save him

03:38.435 --> 03:40.350
than the sister who loves him?

03:43.658 --> 03:45.399
'Luthors are survivors.'

03:47.314 --> 03:50.447
You are one of us, my dear.

03:58.760 --> 04:00.283
It's alright.

04:04.548 --> 04:08.465
When the day is done, I will see
the Luthor name resurrected.

04:09.945 --> 04:12.252

use people's darkness

09:30.134 --> 09:32.572
to mark them with an Omega,
what we don't know is why.

09:32.615 --> 09:34.312
And Tess quoted
one of the prophecies

09:34.356 --> 09:36.706
as saying that the markings
weren't just spiritual.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.578
There's some sort
of anti-life dark force

09:38.621 --> 09:40.623
that could bring about
the apocalypse.

09:40.667 --> 09:43.278
You mean like bringing a giant

09:43.321 --> 09:44.845
Exactly like that.

Too bad, anti-life equations
aren't covered in physics 101.

this, I need to find her.

14:20.511 --> 14:22.078
You're alive.

14:22.122 --> 14:26.778
Seems my father had
a...change of heart.

14:28.302 --> 14:30.217
And I got
a second chance at life.

14:31.522 --> 14:33.916
Where's Tess?

14:33.960 --> 14:35.483
What have you done with her?

14:35.526 --> 14:36.963
She's fine.

14:37.006 --> 14:39.922
I wouldn't worry so much
about my dear little sister.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.706
You know, I used to think
it was our families

14:41.750 --> 14:43.665
that made us who we are.

14:44.927 --> 14:46.842
Then I hoped it was our friends.

14:47.974 --> 14:49.801
But if you look at history

14:49.845 --> 14:51.542
the great men
and women of the world

14:51.586 --> 14:54.415
have always been defined

14:54.458 --> 14:56.634
by their enemies.

14:56.678 --> 14:59.768
You have a second chance.
You can change all that.

14:59.811 --> 15:02.292
But that's the thing
about memories.

15:02.336 --> 15:04.947
You can't forget them.

15:04.991 --> 15:08.342
Like how you were always that
one step ahead of me, Clark.

15:08.385 --> 15:10.692
'No matter how
meticulously I prepared'

15:10.735 --> 15:14.087
no matter how strategic I was.

15:14.130 --> 15:15.871
If only I'd known
I never stood a chance.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.438
It wasn't a competition.

15:17.481 --> 15:20.397
Of course it wasn't.

15:20.441 --> 15:22.573
You were born
to be the chosen one.

15:24.706 --> 15:27.665
You're simply better than us.

15:27.709 --> 15:29.754
And that always killed you.

15:29.798 --> 15:31.974
No.

15:32.018 --> 15:36.848
No, what killed me is that
you didn't even want it.

15:36.892 --> 15:39.373
You fought it.
You-you hid from it!

15:39.416 --> 15:43.116
I would have taken it
and relished it, embraced it.

15:43.159 --> 15:45.988
My destiny wasn't yours to take!

15:47.424 --> 15:50.471
I get that now.

15:50.514 --> 15:53.648
Which is why I finally
embraced my own.

15:58.087 --> 16:00.785
You and I..

16:00.829 --> 16:03.049
We will both be great men.

16:05.529 --> 16:08.706
Because of each other..

16:08.750 --> 16:11.274
...we have a destiny
together, Clark.

16:13.537 --> 16:15.452
Only on different sides.

16:17.585 --> 16:19.500
I'll always
be there to stop you.

16:20.414 --> 16:21.545
Always.

16:23.156 --> 16:25.332
Oh, I'm counting on it.

16:30.293 --> 16:33.905
Our story hasn't been
written yet, Kal-El.

16:35.864 --> 16:40.912
And every villain
is only as great as his hero.

16:44.133 --> 16:45.700
But, you see,
that all relies on you

16:45.743 --> 16:48.137
saving us from
the coming apocalypse.

16:51.227 --> 16:53.708
You know about Darkseid?

16:53.751 --> 16:55.449
You really think I just
read the cliff notes

16:55.492 --> 16:58.104
of the Veritas journals?

16:58.147 --> 17:01.890
They foretold
of a chosen savior.

17:01.933 --> 17:06.068
The light that will inspire
this world out of darkness.

17:08.288 --> 17:10.420
You are the light, Clark.

17:12.118 --> 17:14.250
Only you hold the power
within you.

17:15.686 --> 17:17.340
I'm not so sure

17:17.384 --> 17:20.952
that Clark Kent can save
the entire world on his own.

17:20.996 --> 17:22.302
He can't.

17:25.305 --> 17:27.220
But we both know who can.

17:37.491 --> 17:39.623
I'm sorry
I couldn't save you, Lex.

17:52.767 --> 17:54.377
Activate computer monitors.

17:54.421 --> 17:55.987

[beeping]

18:34.374 --> 18:35.940
[rumbling]

18:41.424 --> 18:43.426
The day of judgment is upon us.

18:43.470 --> 18:46.168
We've saved the willing souls
from the coming apocalypse

18:46.212 --> 18:47.909
to serve the dark lord.

18:47.952 --> 18:50.912
Our work is done.

18:50.955 --> 18:52.696
You can say that again.

18:54.829 --> 18:57.614
Your mark has been lifted.

18:57.658 --> 19:00.530
- That's impossible.
- I got this friend.

19:00.574 --> 19:03.403
Cool leather jacket, blurs
faster than a speeding bullet.

19:03.446 --> 19:05.231
He's pretty good at impossible.

19:05.274 --> 19:08.190
You...were so close

19:08.234 --> 19:10.540
to experiencing the rapture

19:10.584 --> 19:12.151
known only to those who will be

19:12.194 --> 19:15.632
serving our lord for eternity

19:15.676 --> 19:17.982
while all the others perish.

19:18.026 --> 19:20.420
[rumbling]

19:20.463 --> 19:23.205
Do you really think
you possess the power

19:23.249 --> 19:26.643
to vanquish our lord from
the souls of those he saved?

19:26.687 --> 19:29.907
No. But I got friends
in high places.

19:38.264 --> 19:39.265
[grunting]

19:55.150 --> 19:58.066
[intense music]

20:15.736 --> 20:17.738
You're not authorized
to go in there.

20:17.781 --> 20:20.697
I must have forgotten
my hall pass.

20:20.741 --> 20:23.178
I was just
going to the bathroom.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.875
It's that way.

20:24.919 --> 20:27.574
Okay. Well, they said that they
would brief us in two minutes.

20:27.617 --> 20:29.750
It's now been 15,
and I really need..

20:35.538 --> 20:37.801
Do you see that giant
molten orb out there?

20:37.845 --> 20:40.021
Now, whatever story
they told you

20:40.064 --> 20:41.501
it's crashing into the planet.

20:41.544 --> 20:42.850
[rumbling]

20:45.548 --> 20:47.550
You can see it
with your own eyes.

20:54.383 --> 20:56.298
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

20:56.342 --> 20:57.908
I just need
a few minutes of your time.

20:57.952 --> 20:59.736
- I'm sorry, sir.
- No! Wait!

20:59.780 --> 21:01.608
I have information
that you need to know.

21:01.651 --> 21:03.784
I don't know how you got
on this plane, young lady

21:03.827 --> 21:06.177
but you're stepping so far
out of your position.

21:06.221 --> 21:08.876
All that matters is the truth,
and you don't have it.

21:08.919 --> 21:10.269
'Please, Mr. Secretary.'

21:15.099 --> 21:17.058
I have proof that the meteor
that you're about to nuke

21:17.101 --> 21:20.322
into oblivion is much
larger than you realize.

21:20.366 --> 21:23.194
With a density that will result
in you spewing nuclear fallout

21:23.238 --> 21:24.761
over half the hemisphere
that could

21:24.805 --> 21:26.720
take out millions of people.

21:33.553 --> 21:37.034
But you already
know that, don't you?

21:37.078 --> 21:39.341
My God, you all realize that
you're gonna be taking out

21:39.385 --> 21:40.734
a third of
the Earth's population

21:40.777 --> 21:42.692
and you're not even
gonna warn them?

21:44.346 --> 21:46.130
We can't spread panic.

21:46.174 --> 21:50.047
It will only aggravate
an already impossible situation.

21:50.091 --> 21:52.006
And what about your families?

21:55.183 --> 21:57.316
And the President?

21:57.359 --> 22:00.014
- Where are we gonna--
- To a secure bunker.

22:00.057 --> 22:01.755
The casualties are nothing

22:01.798 --> 22:03.626
compared to losing
the entire planet.

22:03.670 --> 22:05.367
[rumbling]

22:05.411 --> 22:07.891
We don't have a choice.

22:07.935 --> 22:09.980
Now, if you'll excuse us..

22:10.024 --> 22:11.591
No, wait.

22:11.634 --> 22:14.202
You do have a choice.

22:14.245 --> 22:17.031
Heroes, one in particular
who will stop this

22:17.074 --> 22:18.989
before you unleash your nukes.

22:19.033 --> 22:20.861
Now, I know that
some deeply disturbed brass

22:20.904 --> 22:22.993
may have rounded them up
and tried to dirty their names

22:23.037 --> 22:25.169
but the people had their day.

22:25.213 --> 22:27.607
And they gave our heroes
a chance to prove themselves.

22:27.650 --> 22:28.999
[rumbling]

22:29.043 --> 22:30.479
You owe the people
of this country

22:30.523 --> 22:33.656
a chance to see that
their faith was worth something.

22:35.441 --> 22:37.573
The world is in crisis!

22:37.617 --> 22:40.359
This is not a time for your
little hero crusade, miss..

22:40.402 --> 22:43.840
Lane. This is exactly
the time for my hero.

22:43.884 --> 22:46.321
He will be here.
He will save us. I promise.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.149
[rumbling]

22:48.192 --> 22:50.107
Now, I know that you all want
to see your families again.

22:50.151 --> 22:52.458
You just need to give
our heroes a chance.

22:58.594 --> 23:00.770
Your heroes have five minutes.

23:04.557 --> 23:06.472
[instrumental music]

23:18.788 --> 23:20.703
[indistinct whispering]

23:30.670 --> 23:34.238
The lost son of Jor-El.

23:35.979 --> 23:36.937
Darkseid.

23:38.417 --> 23:41.028
My father sent me here
to protect this planet.

23:42.551 --> 23:45.075
And I will fight you
till my last breath.

23:45.119 --> 23:48.601
There must be a part of you
that's disgusted

23:48.644 --> 23:52.082
by how easily
your people fell to me.

23:52.126 --> 23:54.041
They may not be perfect,
but I believe

23:54.084 --> 23:57.523
even in the darkest soul,
there's always hope.

23:57.566 --> 24:00.308
People want to believe
in something greater

24:00.351 --> 24:03.659
and it may be easier to hate.

24:03.703 --> 24:05.531
But it's stronger to love.

24:05.574 --> 24:07.315
Is it?

24:07.358 --> 24:11.972
Eons have passed since I came
face-to-face with a force

24:12.015 --> 24:15.845
that could possibly
tip the balance to the light.

24:15.889 --> 24:18.282
- Aah!
- You are the light!

24:18.326 --> 24:21.677
You cast out the darkness
from Oliver Queen

24:21.721 --> 24:24.071
and you will obliterate
my darkness

24:24.114 --> 24:27.335
from the rest of the world
if you are not stopped!

24:28.771 --> 24:31.339
You will surrender to me.

24:31.382 --> 24:33.646
You will lose your soul.

24:33.689 --> 24:35.952
I will annihilate you!

24:38.346 --> 24:40.870
[Jonathan]
Clark, you're gonna
have to let Jor-El guide you

24:40.914 --> 24:42.655
from here on out.

24:46.485 --> 24:50.401
[Jor-El]
You have always had
the power within you, my son.

24:52.578 --> 24:55.494
[instrumental music]

25:24.392 --> 25:27.308

[music continues]

26:28.369 --> 26:31.285

27:02.925 --> 27:04.797
These were my trials.

27:04.840 --> 27:07.887
[Jor-El]
Your final trial
is upon you, my son.

27:10.498 --> 27:13.153
You are ready.

27:13.196 --> 27:15.111
Seize your destiny.

27:18.985 --> 27:21.552
[rumbling]

27:38.569 --> 27:40.876
[intense music]

27:59.547 --> 28:02.028
Something told me
that I'd find you here.

28:03.507 --> 28:06.032
I combed the lab,
and I saw what happened.

28:07.642 --> 28:09.165
Long time, sis.

28:12.778 --> 28:14.301
Did you always know?

28:14.344 --> 28:15.998
Why do you think
I recruited you

28:16.042 --> 28:18.087
treated you
as my own flesh and blood?

28:18.131 --> 28:19.872
You used me.

28:19.915 --> 28:21.482
Semantics.

28:25.138 --> 28:28.489
I'd say dear old dad
did most of the abusing.

28:29.272 --> 28:30.883
Wouldn't you?

28:30.926 --> 28:33.842
I guess the bullet in his chest
answers that question, huh?

28:36.932 --> 28:40.501
He wanted nothing more
than to have you back again.

28:42.677 --> 28:44.723
And what did you want, Tess?

28:46.899 --> 28:48.988
Something I'll never have.

28:49.031 --> 28:50.163
Clark?

28:52.078 --> 28:53.209
Redemption.

29:03.654 --> 29:05.178
I love you, sis.

29:08.311 --> 29:09.443
[gasps]

29:13.621 --> 29:14.709
[groans]

29:16.189 --> 29:18.321
You know
I'm actually saving you.

29:21.977 --> 29:23.762
[panting]

29:26.503 --> 29:28.027
From what?

29:28.070 --> 29:29.985
From turning into me.

29:37.732 --> 29:39.255
It's too late.

29:42.650 --> 29:44.565
Clark already did that.

29:49.352 --> 29:53.356
It's the neurotoxin
that you started at Summerholt.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.445
- It penetrates--
- Dermal tissue.

29:55.489 --> 29:58.622
Paralyzing
all cognitive recognition.

30:01.190 --> 30:03.018
How long?

30:03.062 --> 30:04.411
Thirty seconds.

30:06.065 --> 30:08.545
What will I remember?

30:08.589 --> 30:10.852
Nothing.

30:10.896 --> 30:13.812
The world before this moment
won't exist to you.

'Your journey
has come to an end, Kal-El.'

32:03.312 --> 32:06.968
I shouldn't have tried
to push away my Kryptonian side.

32:07.012 --> 32:10.972
My strength is accepting it..

32:11.016 --> 32:13.366
...accepting you.

32:13.409 --> 32:15.324
[Jor-El]

cannot be measured in words'

'but know that
I am proud of you, son.'

32:21.591 --> 32:24.768
You have no idea how long I've
waited to hear you say that.

a long road together, Kal-El'

are behind you now.'

'Any father can only hope'

32:36.041 --> 32:40.262
'that he is one day humbled
by the feats of his son.'

32:40.306 --> 32:44.788
'But it is your soul, Kal-El,
of which I am most proud.'

32:44.832 --> 32:46.573
'You, and you alone'

32:46.616 --> 32:49.184
'possess the courage,
the determination'

that will be required of you'

Mr. President.

I did, just in time.
Thanks, cuz.

Um, um, did you see
the one with the elephant?

39:47.036 --> 39:48.473
The Man of Steel deserves better

39:48.516 --> 39:50.388

I want pecs, I want cape,
I want pearly whites.

39:53.652 --> 39:56.219

Let me just, uh..
It's just I was, you know..

Can it, Clark.
No one's paying any attention.

Yes, Ms. Lane.

Somebody tell Perry White!
Just came in over the wire!

40:56.236 --> 40:58.368
There's a bomb
in an elevator uptown!

41:01.284 --> 41:04.026
Just tell the minister
I'm gonna be a few minutes late.
