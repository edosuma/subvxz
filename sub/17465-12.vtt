WEBVTT

00:02.500 --> 00:03.766
- Aw!
- Aw!

00:03.768 --> 00:06.936
It's so cute, I just
want to kiss her all over.

00:06.938 --> 00:08.371
So, since we're testing new wetsuits

00:08.373 --> 00:10.139
with linings that mimic her fur,

00:10.141 --> 00:12.408
I brought in an actual
otter for the photo shoot.

00:12.628 --> 00:14.995
Zeb, how's the endurance
test for the wetsuit going?

00:15.267 --> 00:16.119
Not great.

00:16.143 --> 00:17.713
I graduated from Princeton,

00:17.715 --> 00:20.850
and now I'm trying to pee
on myself to stay warm.

00:21.119 --> 00:22.518
Careful, I tried that once

00:22.543 --> 00:24.478
when my dad forgot to pick
me up from ice skating.

00:24.503 --> 00:27.371
It worked, and then it didn't.

00:27.682 --> 00:29.775
This otter's so cute.

00:29.800 --> 00:32.500
How do we not have a tiny
tuxedo and a cigar right now?

00:32.540 --> 00:34.374
Watch out because, like any animal,

00:34.399 --> 00:36.699
if she feels cornered or
threatened, she'll attack.

00:36.989 --> 00:38.823
I know you said something
important, but I just learned

00:38.848 --> 00:40.180
face swap works on otters.

00:44.151 --> 00:45.345
Good morning.

00:45.564 --> 00:47.156
Wait, wait, I know that smell.

00:47.181 --> 00:48.031
Don't tell me, don't tell me.

00:48.033 --> 00:50.033
- It's an otter.
- Wow.

00:50.035 --> 00:51.735
How did you do that?

00:51.737 --> 00:53.637
Oh, the face swap's still on the screen.

00:54.943 --> 00:57.643
But the otter is not the
only cute visitor today.

00:57.668 --> 00:59.353
Paul's gonna be coming
in in a few minutes,

00:59.378 --> 01:01.611
so I would really appreciate
it if you could be nice to him.

01:01.613 --> 01:02.779
Notice I'm talking to all of you

01:02.781 --> 01:04.647
but looking directly at Jack.

01:04.650 --> 01:06.449
All right, so we finally
get to meet your fiancé.

01:06.451 --> 01:08.451
He's a little bit nervous to begin with,

01:08.453 --> 01:10.629
but once he warms up to
you, he can be very sweet.

01:10.654 --> 01:12.833
You realize that nothing
you've ever said about him

01:12.858 --> 01:17.176
contradicts the prevailing
theory that Paul is a cat?

01:17.201 --> 01:18.676
Paul is not a cat.

01:18.701 --> 01:21.469
He's... people.

01:22.083 --> 01:23.215
Is he bringing you lunch?

01:23.217 --> 01:25.417
Maybe a dead bird?

01:25.419 --> 01:27.386
No, he's popping in
to go over a few things

01:27.388 --> 01:28.438
for the party tonight.

01:28.463 --> 01:30.933
Oh, right, your re-engagement party.

01:30.958 --> 01:32.591
What a whimsical way of commemorating

01:32.593 --> 01:35.194
over three years of cold feet.

01:35.868 --> 01:37.096
Very funny.

01:37.345 --> 01:40.877
No, we are celebrating because
we did set a wedding date.

01:40.902 --> 01:43.335
And I like the term "re-engagement."

01:43.337 --> 01:45.137
I mean, what else are you
supposed to call a party

01:45.139 --> 01:46.735
after an engagement party?

01:46.760 --> 01:48.694
Usually, it's called a wedding.

01:50.471 --> 01:52.923
Look, Jack, I know mocking
people is your twisted way

01:52.948 --> 01:54.179
of showing people you care, but...

01:54.181 --> 01:56.448
Oh, my God, is that true?

01:57.676 --> 01:58.876
Paul is sensitive.

01:58.901 --> 02:01.185
So please don't make fun of him.

02:01.210 --> 02:03.910
Yes, of course, I won't
make fun of him, starting...

02:03.935 --> 02:06.036
Paul is a cat... now.

02:06.294 --> 02:07.426
Thank you.

02:07.428 --> 02:09.152
Ah, here he is.

02:09.178 --> 02:10.940
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hi, babe.

02:10.965 --> 02:12.264
- Mwah.
- Mwah.

02:12.266 --> 02:14.083
Everyone, this is Paul.

02:14.108 --> 02:15.207
Sorry I'm late, I, uh,

02:15.336 --> 02:17.202
I curled up and fell
asleep in that sunny spot

02:17.204 --> 02:19.171
right near the window.

02:26.035 --> 02:29.225

02:34.115 --> 02:35.903
So, you're Paul.

02:35.928 --> 02:36.993
Yep, I'm Paul.

02:37.018 --> 02:39.106
Rudd. Gotcha, I'm not Paul Rudd,

02:39.131 --> 02:40.564
I wasn't in Clueless.

02:41.189 --> 02:42.889
I'm Paul... Giamatti. Gotcha.

02:42.891 --> 02:44.316
He's dead. No, he's not, still alive.

02:44.341 --> 02:45.992
Gotcha again.

02:46.927 --> 02:48.594
I don't know when to laugh.

02:49.052 --> 02:50.863
No one does.

02:50.865 --> 02:52.402
I come bearing gifts.

02:52.427 --> 02:53.593
Uh, you must be Emma.

02:53.595 --> 02:54.761
Brooke said you would love

02:54.763 --> 02:56.062
strawberry apricot.

02:56.064 --> 02:57.931
Oh, it's so cute!

02:57.933 --> 02:59.466
It's a jam.

02:59.468 --> 03:01.301
It's a preserve, but
I'll let it go this time.

03:02.304 --> 03:04.170
You must be Mason. And guess what.

03:04.172 --> 03:06.021
This is in a Mason jar,

03:06.046 --> 03:08.646
so that's obviously hysterical, Mason.

03:12.881 --> 03:14.681
Hey, babe, I'm just gonna make a call

03:14.683 --> 03:16.516
- and then we can head out.
- Oh, great, great, great, great.

03:16.518 --> 03:18.451
So I hear you guys are
going out for the weekend.

03:18.453 --> 03:19.452
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:19.454 --> 03:21.020
I was, uh, I was pushing for Seattle.

03:21.022 --> 03:23.356
They've got that cool market
where they throw around fish.

03:23.358 --> 03:25.725
I could watch that all day.

03:26.517 --> 03:29.028
I bet you'd be there with bells on.

03:29.030 --> 03:31.598
But, uh, we're headed to New
Orleans where we got engaged.

03:31.600 --> 03:34.244
Yeah. Hasn't that city
been through enough?

03:35.504 --> 03:37.203
Um, yeah, actually,
that-that reminds me,

03:37.205 --> 03:39.205
I've got all these photos from
our first trip to New Orleans.

03:39.207 --> 03:40.840
I was wondering if you guys
could maybe throw together,

03:40.842 --> 03:42.447
like, a-a slideshow for tonight?

03:42.472 --> 03:43.872
- For tonight? Sure.
- Oh.

03:44.246 --> 03:45.211
Cool.

03:45.213 --> 03:46.546
And, uh, Jack, uh,

03:46.548 --> 03:48.915
can I see you for a
tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte in the kitchenette?

03:49.334 --> 03:51.084
Ooh, accidental rhyme.

03:51.086 --> 03:53.453
Gotcha, I rhymed it on purpose.

03:59.761 --> 04:02.095
I can just whip this up on PowerPoint.

04:02.097 --> 04:03.329
PowerPoint?

04:03.331 --> 04:04.230
That's good if you're doing

04:04.232 --> 04:05.865
a third grade book report, amateur.

04:05.867 --> 04:07.066
No.

04:07.068 --> 04:08.067
We're doing iMovie.

04:08.069 --> 04:09.135
iMovie?

04:09.137 --> 04:10.937
I'm just gonna grab that idea

04:10.939 --> 04:13.239
and drag it into the trash.

04:13.241 --> 04:15.008
We're going with Final Cut Pro.

04:15.010 --> 04:17.377
Okay, guys, love the passion,

04:17.379 --> 04:19.879
but I'm gonna pull rank
and say we go with my plan.

04:20.505 --> 04:21.648
Pull rank?

04:21.649 --> 04:23.149
Dude, you're not in charge of us...

04:23.463 --> 04:24.756
- I am.
- I am.

04:30.525 --> 04:32.091
We should figure this out.

04:32.093 --> 04:33.250
Totally.

04:33.275 --> 04:35.742
Except I'm the one saying
we should figure this out.

04:37.199 --> 04:40.567
- "TÃªte-Ã -tÃªte, kitchenette."
- Yeah.

04:41.320 --> 04:42.735
Milk?

04:42.737 --> 04:45.004
Oh, no, I'm-I'm lactose intolerant.

04:47.560 --> 04:49.780
So, uh, Roland felt bad
about being out of town,

04:49.805 --> 04:51.110
so he, uh, he sent me a toast

04:51.112 --> 04:52.779
for someone to read
at the party tonight.

04:52.781 --> 04:54.414
I think you would be perfect for that.

04:54.416 --> 04:55.648
Oh, Paul,

04:55.650 --> 04:57.250
you seem like a very nice guy,

04:57.252 --> 04:59.485
so, what's a nice way to tell someone

04:59.487 --> 05:01.287
that you don't want to do something?

05:02.624 --> 05:04.591
I don't know what Brooke was
talking about, you're funny.

05:06.828 --> 05:08.561
Seriously, though, um,

05:08.563 --> 05:10.296
I know it'd mean so much to her.

05:10.298 --> 05:12.332
Geez.

05:12.334 --> 05:15.668
I've never... this speech
has an intermission.

05:17.072 --> 05:18.705
Yeah, sure, I'd love to.

05:18.707 --> 05:20.240
Oh, fantastic, oh.

05:20.242 --> 05:22.108
I knew we'd get along,
we have so much in common.

05:22.594 --> 05:25.172
Well, we have been in a
lot of the same places.

05:28.899 --> 05:31.184
Duh, a Digital Conversation Specialist

05:31.186 --> 05:34.220
obviously reports to the
Online Content Curator.

05:34.222 --> 05:36.445
Yeah, maybe in Iran.

05:37.273 --> 05:39.475
Guys, have you spent
this whole time arguing

05:39.500 --> 05:41.027
over who has seniority?

05:41.029 --> 05:42.528
Not the whole time.

05:42.530 --> 05:45.098
The otter got bored, so
we put her in the tank.

05:45.100 --> 05:46.799
Jack, did you say they attack?

05:46.801 --> 05:47.834
Only when cornered.

05:47.859 --> 05:51.661
Well, this tank is nothing but corners!

05:56.601 --> 05:58.341
Hey, hey, hey, party people.

05:58.407 --> 05:59.806
You all set with the slideshow?

05:59.808 --> 06:02.075
I am. I rented this
projector from the library.

06:02.077 --> 06:04.478
Gotcha. I actually paid $3,000 for it.

06:04.480 --> 06:05.579
What?!

06:06.815 --> 06:08.515
I'll see you guys up there.

06:09.530 --> 06:10.629
Crap!

06:10.819 --> 06:12.986
That was the perfect opportunity

06:12.988 --> 06:14.554
to tell Paul we didn't do the slideshow!

06:14.556 --> 06:16.423
Why did we spend all day
arguing over the fact that

06:16.425 --> 06:17.824
you two report to me?

06:17.826 --> 06:18.859
Report to you?

06:18.861 --> 06:20.761
I should fire both your asses.

06:22.564 --> 06:25.465
Man, this speech is the most
confusing and bloated thing

06:25.467 --> 06:26.566
I've ever seen.

06:26.568 --> 06:28.922
And I've seen manatees have sex.

06:30.339 --> 06:31.972
That was for work, right?

06:31.974 --> 06:33.570
Uh, sure.

06:34.677 --> 06:36.055
You all right, man?

06:36.375 --> 06:38.145
This whole Brooke and
Paul engagement stuff

06:38.147 --> 06:39.680
must be kind of awkward for you, huh?

06:39.682 --> 06:41.000
Why would it be awkward?

06:41.025 --> 06:43.894
Well, you're standing in
for the father of the woman

06:43.919 --> 06:45.318
you slept with at a party

06:45.320 --> 06:48.121
to celebrate her re-engagement
to someone who isn't you.

06:49.224 --> 06:50.586
And your fly's down.

06:51.383 --> 06:54.494
It's down on purpose; it's a power move.

06:55.931 --> 06:57.397
Thank you all for coming.

06:57.399 --> 07:00.125
I know there's been a bit
of confusion over tonight,

07:00.150 --> 07:02.150
so I just wanted to say that...

07:02.371 --> 07:05.072
yes, this venue was our second choice.

07:06.241 --> 07:09.476
This is the first I've heard of this.

07:09.478 --> 07:10.677
A special thanks to

07:10.679 --> 07:12.479
Clark, Mason and Emma
for putting together

07:12.481 --> 07:14.848
the fantastic slideshow
we're all about to see.

07:17.753 --> 07:20.430
But first, Brooke,
uh, I have a surprise.

07:20.455 --> 07:22.299
I know you're really sad
your father couldn't be here.

07:22.324 --> 07:24.558
Roland couldn't get
back from Canada in time,

07:24.560 --> 07:26.126
but he wrote a toast.

07:26.128 --> 07:29.180
And who better to read
it than Jack Gordon?

07:33.712 --> 07:35.679
Please say "Gotcha."

07:41.148 --> 07:43.977
"Brooke, you're the love of my life."

07:46.060 --> 07:48.327
Oh, I should point out
that I've already started

07:48.352 --> 07:49.484
Roland's speech.

07:52.203 --> 07:54.955
"Brooke, when I look in your eyes,

07:54.957 --> 07:56.562
my world comes into focus."

07:56.725 --> 07:57.991
You know what? Um...

07:57.993 --> 07:59.426
I think Roland would be okay

07:59.428 --> 08:01.728
if I just skipped to
the highlights, uh...

08:01.730 --> 08:04.664
Oh, this looks a little more safe.

08:04.666 --> 08:07.167
"Thoughts on my family.

08:07.169 --> 08:09.102
"Before you came into my life, Brooke,

08:09.104 --> 08:11.505
"I was addicted to thrills
in the outside world,

08:11.507 --> 08:13.740
but I was hollow on the inside."

08:15.873 --> 08:19.008
I'll find something that
people can relate to. Ugh.

08:19.882 --> 08:21.715
"Paul has a splendid sense of humor."

08:21.717 --> 08:23.116
Nope. Uh...

08:25.432 --> 08:28.138
"And he's a smart chap
because only a fool

08:28.163 --> 08:30.547
would not stay with you for..."

08:33.495 --> 08:35.128
"...ever." Right.

08:35.130 --> 08:36.696
Oh, great.

08:38.200 --> 08:41.937
"Brooke, I love you more
than you will ever know."

08:43.304 --> 08:44.471
Geez,

08:44.473 --> 08:46.072
this speech is so long and complicated.

08:46.074 --> 08:47.641
It's just like Paul
and Brooke's engagement.

08:49.444 --> 08:50.944
I mean, am I right?

08:50.946 --> 08:52.345
A re-engagement?

08:52.347 --> 08:54.381
Someone get a shotgun,
not for the wedding,

08:54.383 --> 08:56.516
but to put this saga out of its misery.

08:57.820 --> 08:59.853
How dare you, sir.

09:01.264 --> 09:03.197
And, uh, of course, we're in Chicago.

09:03.222 --> 09:06.961
Home of the World
Series champs, the Cubs.

09:09.264 --> 09:10.897
And it's also home to Paul and Brooke,

09:10.899 --> 09:13.099
another team of lovable losers

09:13.101 --> 09:14.301
who won't get rings

09:14.303 --> 09:16.069
for another 108 years.

09:17.773 --> 09:19.172
Do me. Do me, please.

09:19.174 --> 09:20.607
"Do me, please."

09:20.609 --> 09:22.642
Oh, Alex, uh, what are

09:22.644 --> 09:26.413
phrases never heard in
Paul and Brooke's bedroom?

09:28.250 --> 09:30.917
Ooh, direct hit.

09:30.919 --> 09:32.986
Cheers, everyone.

09:32.988 --> 09:34.688
Mmm.

09:37.359 --> 09:38.523
Are you okay?

09:38.548 --> 09:41.116
Yeah, I'm good. Let's, uh,
let's keep this party going.

09:41.330 --> 09:43.163
Gotcha. If you need me,
I'll be getting drunk

09:43.165 --> 09:45.131
and chasing pigeons in Grant Park.

09:46.802 --> 09:48.301
Oh, no.

09:48.303 --> 09:49.436
Come back.

09:49.438 --> 09:51.271
What about our slideshow?

10:00.740 --> 10:02.073
Hey, Esther, how you doin'?

10:02.075 --> 10:03.541
Fine.

10:07.250 --> 10:08.880
Just fine?

10:08.882 --> 10:10.248
You don't want to tell me

10:10.250 --> 10:13.218
about your creepy landlord
leaving you processed meats?

10:13.220 --> 10:16.148
Or how you turned your
closet into a bat sanctuary?

10:17.062 --> 10:18.156
Not today.

10:20.326 --> 10:22.953
This might be the scariest
conversation we've had yet.

10:34.321 --> 10:35.531
Mason?

10:37.859 --> 10:38.643
Emma?

10:40.797 --> 10:41.879
Zeb?

10:47.554 --> 10:48.419
Good morning, Clark.

10:50.957 --> 10:53.124
Good morning, Clark.

10:57.964 --> 10:59.597
I suppose you're all ignoring me

10:59.599 --> 11:01.466
because of what happened last night?

11:01.468 --> 11:03.167
So I told some jokes,

11:03.169 --> 11:05.103
some of which may have gone too far,

11:05.105 --> 11:07.184
but I didn't mean to
hurt anyone's feelings.

11:07.209 --> 11:07.872
No,

11:07.874 --> 11:09.607
you just got uncomfortable
making an emotional speech

11:09.609 --> 11:11.175
and started putting down Paul.

11:11.177 --> 11:13.111
In fact, if I didn't know any better,

11:13.113 --> 11:15.380
I'd say there's something
about Paul that threatens you.

11:15.382 --> 11:18.349
And when Jack feels threatened
or cornered, he attacks.

11:18.351 --> 11:19.684
Jack's an emotional otter.

11:19.686 --> 11:21.653
- Ooh...
- Ooh...

11:21.655 --> 11:23.254
Don't "ooh" like that's a thing.

11:23.256 --> 11:24.422
That's not a thing.

11:24.424 --> 11:26.024
Oh, look, he's threatened right now.

11:26.026 --> 11:27.692
- He's ottering.
- Ottering! Ottering!

11:27.694 --> 11:30.061
- He's ottering!
- Ottering is not a thing, all right?

11:30.063 --> 11:32.897
And why would I be
threatened by Jam Master Paul?

11:32.899 --> 11:34.932
I mean, everyone else
is too thin-skinned.

11:34.934 --> 11:38.503
I mean, I wouldn't be upset
if someone tried to mock my...

11:38.669 --> 11:39.554
hmm.

11:40.106 --> 11:42.578
I can't think of anything
about me that's mock-able.

11:43.276 --> 11:44.709
How about how you only use small mugs

11:44.711 --> 11:45.910
so your hands look bigger?

11:45.912 --> 11:48.279
Or how you look like a
stretched out David Spade?

11:48.281 --> 11:49.747
And how you take beard vitamins?

11:49.749 --> 11:51.049
And how you think
that Dave Matthews Band

11:51.051 --> 11:52.417
is better than the Beatles?

11:52.419 --> 11:54.819
Whatever. Clark, you
want to get in on this?

11:54.844 --> 11:55.405
No.

11:55.430 --> 11:56.788
Come on, they're just
jokes. They don't hurt.

11:56.790 --> 11:58.790
- I don't want to be mean.
- Burn me, Clark!

11:58.792 --> 12:00.925
You look like you were
built using irregular pieces

12:00.927 --> 12:04.595
from Dax Shepard and
Dirk Nowitzki. Oh, my...

12:07.355 --> 12:10.635
Well, you see that this
has proved my point:

12:10.637 --> 12:12.236
none of this affects me.

12:12.238 --> 12:15.073
And you're right, uh, if I
have hurt anyone's feelings,

12:15.075 --> 12:17.008
I will go apologize to Brooke.

12:17.292 --> 12:20.244
It's obvious you're losing
that battle against dad bod!

12:21.581 --> 12:22.880
Dude, easy.

12:22.882 --> 12:25.116
Oh, you shut up, nerdy Urkel.

12:27.486 --> 12:30.688
It's so intoxicating.

12:33.860 --> 12:35.526
Brooke, uh,

12:35.528 --> 12:39.831
I had a good talk with the
kids from Stranger Things.

12:39.833 --> 12:42.567
And I want to apologize for last night.

12:42.569 --> 12:44.535
Yeah, well, you hurt Paul's feelings,

12:44.537 --> 12:47.423
you mocked our relationship,
and you ruined our party.

12:48.074 --> 12:49.507
If you're gonna list
things out individually,

12:49.509 --> 12:50.985
we are gonna be here a long time.

12:52.065 --> 12:54.212
All I asked is for you to be nice.

12:54.644 --> 12:57.812
Is something bothering
you or are you just a jerk?

12:59.183 --> 13:00.883
Are those my only two options?

13:01.850 --> 13:03.517
Well, then I guess I'm the jerk

13:03.542 --> 13:05.347
that got carried away at your party.

13:05.372 --> 13:07.043
But that's it. There's
nothing else going on.

13:07.068 --> 13:09.902
I mean, the point is, I'm really sorry.

13:10.397 --> 13:11.829
Okay, thank you.

13:12.276 --> 13:13.620
So, we're good, right?

13:13.645 --> 13:15.977
Well, we will be, once you
apologize to Paul, as well.

13:16.002 --> 13:17.802
I have to do this aga...

13:17.804 --> 13:19.904
You're right. I'm... I will.

13:22.065 --> 13:24.409
So, we finally figured
out the hierarchy.

13:24.411 --> 13:25.777
I'm in charge of Clark,

13:25.779 --> 13:27.645
Clark's in charge of Emma,

13:28.269 --> 13:29.847
Emma's in charge of me?

13:29.849 --> 13:33.206
The ol' rock-paper-scissors
management structure.

13:33.855 --> 13:35.286
Unorthodox but effective.

13:35.620 --> 13:37.655
Yeah, this could be really cool.

13:38.026 --> 13:39.090
Mason, get me a soda.

13:39.092 --> 13:40.491
Clark, get Emma a soda.

13:40.493 --> 13:42.126
Emma, get your own soda.

13:44.731 --> 13:46.531
Guys, I'm gonna go apologize to Paul.

13:46.533 --> 13:47.999
If I'm not back in an hour,

13:48.001 --> 13:50.201
he's murdered me and jarred my remains.

13:58.472 --> 13:59.444
Hey, Jack.

13:59.446 --> 14:01.245
I assume you're gonna
make fun of my apron?

14:01.247 --> 14:02.230
No.

14:02.849 --> 14:05.082
No, you totally pull it off.

14:05.474 --> 14:07.174
Let me pull it off.

14:08.745 --> 14:12.423
Paul, uh, I got carried away
with the jokes at your party.

14:12.425 --> 14:14.158
I was totally fine.

14:14.160 --> 14:17.562
Gotcha... I was so mad, I
was up all night capping jars.

14:18.347 --> 14:19.897
You still have preserves on your face.

14:19.899 --> 14:21.499
Really?

14:24.456 --> 14:27.839
I-I-I'm just sorry that
I hurt your feelings.

14:27.841 --> 14:31.009
Oh, thanks. Maybe I was
being overly sensitive.

14:31.034 --> 14:32.376
You know, but can you really blame me?

14:32.378 --> 14:34.078
Especially since, you know,

14:34.080 --> 14:35.680
you and Brooke hooked up that one time.

14:35.682 --> 14:38.249
Yeah, anyone would feel threatened.

14:38.251 --> 14:40.667
Yeah, uh, but, uh,
then I thought about it,

14:40.692 --> 14:42.186
and, you know, you're
going through a lot.

14:42.188 --> 14:43.688
Dealing with that professional setback

14:43.690 --> 14:45.533
of being stuck in the office now,

14:45.558 --> 14:47.001
living with a roommate above a bar...

14:47.026 --> 14:49.527
Okay, let's go back to you
feeling threatened by me,

14:49.529 --> 14:50.661
because that's the real point.

14:50.663 --> 14:51.829
No, no, no, no.

14:51.831 --> 14:53.598
I realized I'm fine. I mean,

14:53.600 --> 14:57.292
I've got a ton of friends
who all beg me to do stand-up.

15:00.362 --> 15:02.673
I've got an enormously
profitable preserves business.

15:02.675 --> 15:04.008
You're rich from this stuff?

15:04.010 --> 15:06.110
Oh, very. Yeah.

15:06.112 --> 15:09.180
Yeah, and best of all,
I've got a great fiancée,

15:09.182 --> 15:10.648
and really, you know,
that's what counts the most

15:10.650 --> 15:12.717
for a hilarious dude in his early 30s.

15:12.719 --> 15:14.452
Early 30s?

15:15.167 --> 15:16.787
Still, thank you.

15:16.789 --> 15:18.389
It takes a big man to apologize.

15:18.391 --> 15:21.392
Oh, no, no. You are a
much bigger man than me.

15:21.417 --> 15:23.427
- No.
- I mean, I don't know what I would do

15:23.429 --> 15:25.963
if my fiancée called in a former fling

15:25.988 --> 15:28.135
and worked in the same office every day.

15:28.160 --> 15:29.166
I mean, life, right?

15:30.703 --> 15:32.103
Huh.

15:32.105 --> 15:34.605
Never thought about those
facts in that exact order.

15:35.254 --> 15:37.208
Well, you are one cool cat.

15:37.210 --> 15:38.576
Oh.

15:45.058 --> 15:46.817
I love apologizing.

15:46.819 --> 15:49.387
It makes me feel so much
better than everyone else.

15:49.389 --> 15:51.622
Then you're definitely
not doing it right.

15:51.624 --> 15:54.625
Jack Gordon, you absolute ass!

15:54.627 --> 15:55.652
See?

15:56.722 --> 15:58.873
You hinted to Paul I brought
you back to work in the office

15:58.898 --> 16:00.131
for some kind of romantic reason?

16:00.133 --> 16:02.409
In the form of an apology.

16:03.136 --> 16:04.869
This is serious.

16:04.871 --> 16:07.772
He's called off our trip to New Orleans.

16:08.618 --> 16:10.518
Brooke, I...

16:11.113 --> 16:12.762
Oh, I need more time.

16:12.787 --> 16:15.354
I didn't think you were
gonna stop mid-storm-out.

16:17.255 --> 16:18.354
Brooke, please!

16:19.615 --> 16:21.081
I-I can't do it now.

16:21.106 --> 16:22.706
It's too much pressure.

16:23.722 --> 16:24.626
Sorry.

16:26.889 --> 16:29.489
What's wrong with me?

16:33.332 --> 16:35.416
So you ruined Brooke and Paul's party,

16:35.441 --> 16:36.733
then caused a huge fight between them.

16:36.735 --> 16:40.299
Do you want bartender
advice or friend advice?

16:40.324 --> 16:41.456
Bartender advice.

16:41.458 --> 16:42.824
Welp,

16:42.826 --> 16:46.094
I'm just a simple bartender,

16:46.096 --> 16:47.784
but it seems to me,

16:47.809 --> 16:50.376
there might be something
else going on here.

16:51.039 --> 16:53.506
Mm-hmm. Let's go with friend advice.

16:53.531 --> 16:55.164
Ow!

16:55.189 --> 16:56.555
You're still hung up on Brooke.

16:56.580 --> 16:58.613
I want to talk to the bartender again.

16:58.875 --> 17:00.269
He's on break.

17:00.294 --> 17:03.228
Look, I'm not hung up
on Brooke. I mean it.

17:03.530 --> 17:05.357
I mean, how could I
be if I work with her

17:05.382 --> 17:06.481
every single day?

17:06.483 --> 17:07.698
Then what's the difference this time?

17:07.723 --> 17:09.289
I don't know. Fiancé's around?

17:09.455 --> 17:11.339
What, are you in love with Paul?

17:12.097 --> 17:13.730
Here's what I think it is...

17:13.857 --> 17:16.124
I mean, meeting Paul,
seeing them together,

17:16.126 --> 17:17.613
all that stuff in Roland's speech

17:17.637 --> 17:20.722
freaked me out and made me think
that maybe that's what I want.

17:20.747 --> 17:22.046
Well, who doesn't?

17:22.242 --> 17:23.942
But you need to make things right.

17:24.101 --> 17:25.733
We all think so.

17:25.736 --> 17:27.377
What-what are you, Irish or Jamaican?

17:27.403 --> 17:29.169
Who am I talking to?

17:33.343 --> 17:34.581
Guys, I need your help.

17:34.606 --> 17:35.605
Clark, Jack needs your help.

17:35.630 --> 17:36.613
Emma, Jack needs your help.

17:36.638 --> 17:38.505
Mason, where's my damn soda?

17:40.444 --> 17:42.671
Hey, you guys aren't
still trying to figure out

17:42.696 --> 17:43.936
who's in charge, are you?

17:43.961 --> 17:45.397
- Yes.
- It's me.

17:45.422 --> 17:48.690
There, I helped you,
now you need to help me.

17:48.692 --> 17:51.092
I need to make a big
gesture to Paul and Brooke.

17:51.094 --> 17:52.293
No bad ideas.

17:52.295 --> 17:54.162
How about a re-apology party?

17:54.164 --> 17:56.397
Starting... That sucked... now.

18:00.203 --> 18:02.045
Look, Jack, even if you wanted

18:02.070 --> 18:04.116
to talk to both of us, there
is nothing you could say

18:04.141 --> 18:06.908
to get Paul to come back here.

18:06.910 --> 18:08.977
All right, Jack, where is this

18:08.979 --> 18:11.679
"private stash of rare loganberries"?

18:11.681 --> 18:12.777
Paul,

18:13.809 --> 18:16.577
there are no loganberries.
Just an apology.

18:16.602 --> 18:17.968
Now,

18:17.993 --> 18:19.664
I know I tease a lot of people,

18:19.689 --> 18:22.132
and usually we all get
a big kick out of it.

18:22.159 --> 18:23.486
- No, we don't.
- Sure we do,

18:23.511 --> 18:24.810
but I overstepped with you.

18:24.961 --> 18:27.295
I saw a happy couple and I lashed out.

18:27.297 --> 18:29.764
And even though my insults
were, top to bottom,

18:29.766 --> 18:32.298
undeniably hilarious,

18:32.323 --> 18:34.323
they were also hurtful.

18:34.348 --> 18:36.515
And for that I apologize.

18:36.740 --> 18:38.744
Thank you, Jack.

18:39.543 --> 18:41.251
So, just to clarify, um...

18:41.311 --> 18:42.710
there are no loganberries?

18:42.712 --> 18:44.392
No, but

18:44.417 --> 18:45.716
because I ruined your trip,

18:45.827 --> 18:47.994
I had the kids put together
a little surprise for you.

18:48.418 --> 18:49.637
Really? What is it?

18:49.662 --> 18:51.662
The curiosity might kill me.

18:53.197 --> 18:55.490
Since you didn't go to New Orleans,

18:55.492 --> 18:57.859
we brought a little
bit of New Orleans...

18:57.861 --> 18:58.693
to you!

19:00.063 --> 19:01.229
Oh, my God.

19:01.231 --> 19:02.330
Nope.

19:03.700 --> 19:04.833
Was that a Christmas tree?

19:04.835 --> 19:06.067
Probably. Anyway,

19:06.069 --> 19:08.517
uh, I thought something
like this might happen.

19:08.542 --> 19:10.238
My friend, Connor, is a pilot.

19:10.240 --> 19:11.806
He is waiting at
O'Hare's private airfield

19:11.808 --> 19:13.341
to take you to New Orleans tonight.

19:13.343 --> 19:14.676
Wha...?

19:14.678 --> 19:16.411
Here are the security passes
to get you on the tarmac.

19:16.413 --> 19:19.681
Oh, thank you.

19:20.023 --> 19:21.789
That is really thoughtful, Jack.

19:23.153 --> 19:25.787
Yeah, well, I still think
you're an arrogant jerk.

19:27.017 --> 19:28.556
Gotcha. You won me over!
