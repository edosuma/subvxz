WEBVTT

00:02.103 --> 00:03.571
- NO, BUDDY, NO.

00:03.604 --> 00:05.339
ABREU'S HEADED FOR
A SOPHOMORE SLUMP.

00:05.373 --> 00:07.075
IT'S ONE OF THE ETERNAL LAWS
OF THE SPORT.

00:07.108 --> 00:08.342
- I DON'T KNOW, BRO.

00:08.376 --> 00:10.578
THOSE CUBANS
PLAY BY THEIR OWN RULES.

00:10.611 --> 00:11.879
- THEN GO AHEAD AND DRAFT HIM,
BUT DON'T COME BITCHING TO ME

00:11.912 --> 00:13.647
WHEN HE GOES 0 FOR APRIL.
[text alert]

00:13.681 --> 00:14.382
- OH, DO YOU WANT ME
TO GET THAT?

00:14.415 --> 00:16.317
- YES, PLEASE.

00:16.350 --> 00:18.386
- TEXT FROM THERESA,
THE APARTMENT FELL THROUGH.

00:18.419 --> 00:20.854
- AW, DAMN.
THAT PLACE WAS PERFECT.

00:20.888 --> 00:21.889
- DO YOU WANT ME TO TEXT
HER BACK?

00:21.922 --> 00:24.758
- YEAH, WRITE "BUMMER."

00:24.792 --> 00:26.760
- LOOKS A LITTLE COLD.

00:26.794 --> 00:27.828
DO YOU WANT ME
TO SEND A FROWNY FACE,

00:27.861 --> 00:28.829
LIKE YOU'RE REALLY SAD ABOUT IT?

00:28.862 --> 00:30.864
- NO.
[chuckles]

00:30.898 --> 00:32.200
NO, I DON'T DO THAT.
- COME ON.

00:32.233 --> 00:33.867
- EMOJIS?

00:33.901 --> 00:35.103
EVERYBODY USES EMOJIS, JOHN.

00:35.136 --> 00:36.270
- EVERYBODY USES EMOJIS, JOHN.

00:36.304 --> 00:37.571
- OH, YEAH, I DON'T USE EMOJIS.

00:37.605 --> 00:39.073
- THEN YOU BETTER GET
WITH THE TIMES.

00:39.107 --> 00:39.840
- OKAY, WELL, LET'S JUST GO
OLD-SCHOOL,

00:39.873 --> 00:41.442
TRADITIONAL SAD FACE.

00:41.475 --> 00:45.045
JUST GO...UH, COLON-PARENTHESES.
CALL IT A DAY.

00:45.079 --> 00:47.748
- LOOK, TRUST ME,
I'VE GOT SOMETHING YOU'LL LIKE.

00:47.781 --> 00:49.250
- WHAT'D YOU SEND?

00:49.283 --> 00:51.585
- AWW.
LOOK AT THAT CRYING PANDA.

00:51.619 --> 00:53.087
- THAT'S WEIRD.
- YEAH.

00:53.121 --> 00:55.756
WHO WOULD WANT TO MAKE
A PANDA CRY?

00:55.789 --> 00:58.526
AW, DID SOMEONE TAKE AWAY
YOUR BAMBOO, BRO?

00:58.559 --> 01:00.361
I'LL KILL 'EM.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.596
HEY, YOU WANT ME
TO TEXT ANYTHING BACK, T?

01:02.630 --> 01:04.765
- YEAH.

01:04.798 --> 01:08.302
- WHAT'D SHE WRITE BACK?

01:08.336 --> 01:09.237
- "HI, HANK."

01:09.270 --> 01:10.804
- [laughs]

01:12.173 --> 01:15.409
* CAN I RIDE,
CAN I RIDE *

01:17.845 --> 01:20.981
- T, I GOT TO SAY, YOU
AND JOHNNY GOT IT THESE DAYS.

01:21.014 --> 01:23.251
YOU GOT HEAT.
ESTAN CALIENTE.

01:23.284 --> 01:24.952
I CAN FEEL IT IN THE PHONE.

01:24.985 --> 01:26.487
- OH, THAT'S 'CAUSE
YOU LEFT IT IN THE SUN.

01:26.520 --> 01:28.756
- YEAH, BUT NAH,
Y'ALL LOOK BONA FIDE.

01:28.789 --> 01:30.591
- IT'S KIND OF TRUE.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.626
IN A WEIRD WAY
I THINK ALMOST GETTING MARRIED

01:32.660 --> 01:35.796
MADE US CLOSER THAN ACTUALLY
GETTING MARRIED.

01:35.829 --> 01:37.598
I'VE NEVER BEEN HAPPIER.

01:37.631 --> 01:40.634
- THAT'S REALLY SWEET, T.
HEY, CAN I DATE YOUR SISTER?

01:40.668 --> 01:42.403
- WHAT?
WHO?

01:42.436 --> 01:44.238
- YOUR SISTER MAEVE,
SHE'S KIND OF SHORT,

01:44.272 --> 01:45.673
GOT BROWN HAIR
AND THESE REALLY SWEET TITTIES?

01:45.706 --> 01:46.940
- NO, YOU DON'T WANT
TO DATE MAEVE.

01:46.974 --> 01:48.942
SHE IS A TERRIBLE GIRLFRIEND.

01:48.976 --> 01:50.811
- ACTUALLY, SHE'S BEEN GREAT.
OH, DAMN.

01:50.844 --> 01:52.613
- SERIOUSLY?
- T.

01:52.646 --> 01:54.615
- SERIOUSLY?
- REMEMBER THAT DAY LAST WEEK

01:54.648 --> 01:56.417
THAT WAS REALLY PRETTY OUT?
- OH, NO.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.186
- LET'S PRETEND LIKE I ASKED YOU

01:58.219 --> 02:00.321
IF I COULD DATE HER TWO WEEKS
BEFORE THAT.

02:08.962 --> 02:09.930
- WAS IT THE PEANUTS?

02:09.963 --> 02:11.599
- YES.
- UH-HUH.

02:11.632 --> 02:12.966
- PLEASE TELL ME
YOU DIDN'T TRY

02:13.000 --> 02:13.867
TO CURE A PEANUT ALLERGY
WITH PEANUTS.

02:13.901 --> 02:15.969
- MY HERBALIST TOLD ME ABOUT IT.

02:16.003 --> 02:17.805
YOU GIVE YOURSELF A LITTLE BIT
OF THE ALLERGEN EVERY DAY

02:17.838 --> 02:18.972
AND SLOWLY INCREASE THE DOSAGE.

02:19.006 --> 02:20.341
- YOUR HERBALIST
IS FULL OF SH--.

02:20.374 --> 02:22.042
- THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL PLACE.

02:22.075 --> 02:24.478
HOW MUCH DO YOU PAY,
IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING?

02:24.512 --> 02:25.446
- OH, I OWN IT.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.715
- NICE.

02:27.748 --> 02:29.450
HOW MUCH DID THAT SET YOU BACK,
IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING?

02:29.483 --> 02:31.552
- NO IDEA.

02:31.585 --> 02:32.953
MY PARENTS GOT IT FOR ME
AS PART OF MY TRUST FUND.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.522
I'M REFURBISHING THE BUILDING.

02:34.555 --> 02:36.557
- WHEN YOU'RE NOT TRYING
TO KILL YOURSELF?

02:36.590 --> 02:38.626
- I CLIMBED K2; I THINK
I CAN CONQUER A PEANUT ALLERGY.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.528
- WHAT'S K2?

02:40.561 --> 02:41.462
- IT'S THE SECOND-HIGHEST
MOUNTAIN IN THE WORLD.

02:41.495 --> 02:42.696
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD CLIMB EVEREST

02:42.730 --> 02:44.332
BEFORE YOU
TRY TO TACKLE PEANUTS.

02:44.365 --> 02:46.033
- YEAH, YOU DON'T WANT
TO MESS WITH ALLERGIES.

02:46.066 --> 02:47.835
I'M ALLERGIC TO BEE STINGS.

02:47.868 --> 02:50.338
IT'S NOT DEADLY, BUT I KEEP
AN EPIPEN AROUND JUST IN CASE.

02:50.371 --> 02:51.739
PROBABLY GOOD ADVICE FOR YOU.

02:51.772 --> 02:52.740
- HEY, HOW YOU FEELING?

02:52.773 --> 02:54.242
- BETTER.

02:54.275 --> 02:55.876
MUCH BETTER.

02:55.909 --> 02:57.578
- I'M GONNA BE RIGHT BACK
WITH SOME PAPERWORK.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.179
YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

02:59.213 --> 03:01.048
- I'VE GOT A COUSIN
WHO SWELLS UP LIKE A BALLOON

03:01.081 --> 03:02.916
ANY TIME HE HAS SHALLOTS.

03:02.950 --> 03:04.852
YOU'D BE SURPRISED HOW MANY
THINGS HAVE SHALLOTS IN THEM.

03:04.885 --> 03:06.587
- ACTUALLY, I WOULDN'T.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.256
I GOT PRETTY HEAVY INTO SHALLOTS
ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO

03:08.289 --> 03:09.657
WHEN I WAS IN INDONESIA.

03:09.690 --> 03:11.091
I GOT TO SAY,
COMPARED TO ONIONS,

03:11.124 --> 03:12.860
THEIR FLAVONOID LEVELS
ARE OFF THE CHARTS.

03:12.893 --> 03:15.763
- HANK, THIS GUY KNOWS SHALLOTS.
- MM-HMM.

03:15.796 --> 03:18.566
- OH, HEY, SORRY.

03:18.599 --> 03:19.600
CAN I BORROW YOU FOR A SECOND?

03:19.633 --> 03:21.535
- YEAH.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.609
- SO WHAT CAN YOU TELL ME
ABOUT SHALLOTS?

03:28.642 --> 03:30.578
- EVERYTHING.

03:30.611 --> 03:31.679
- HMM?

03:31.712 --> 03:33.681
- WHOA.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.549
- AND IT'S FOR RENT, AND IT'S
PERFECT FOR THERESA AND ME.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.117
- DUDE.

03:37.150 --> 03:38.852
LOOK AT THE NATURAL LIGHT.
- UH-HUH.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.388
- GOT A GREAT KITCHEN,

03:40.421 --> 03:43.223
HUGE BEDROOM,
A TUB BIG ENOUGH FOR ME.

03:43.257 --> 03:44.792
I DON'T FIT IN JUST ANY TUB,
JOHN.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.093
I WANT THIS APARTMENT.

03:46.126 --> 03:47.961
- NOT A CHANCE.
I FOUND IT.

03:47.995 --> 03:49.630
YOU CAN COME VISIT, BUT
THIS APARTMENT BELONGS TO ME.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.465
THAT'S MY TUB.

03:51.499 --> 03:53.267
OKAY, THAT'S THERESA'S TUB,

03:53.301 --> 03:54.368
BUT SHOULD I CHOOSE
TO TAKE A BATH,

03:54.402 --> 03:56.136
I'M TAKING IT IN THAT TUB.

03:56.169 --> 03:58.372
- THIS APARTMENT
HAS SO MUCH POTENTIAL,

03:58.406 --> 03:59.773
AND YOU ARE GONNA SQUANDER IT.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.709
YOU'RE A SQUANDERER.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.278
- THERESA AND I ARE GONNA
HAVE SO MUCH SEX IN HERE.

04:04.312 --> 04:07.448
I CAN HEAR IT NOW.
HEY, PEANUT...HEY, BABY.

04:07.481 --> 04:08.916
- I DON'T HEAR NOTHING.

04:14.288 --> 04:15.656
- DEMOLITION MAN.
- TOO LOUD.

04:15.689 --> 04:17.325
THE ARTIST?

04:17.358 --> 04:18.992
- TOO QUIET.
FAST AND FURIOUS.

04:19.026 --> 04:20.928
- TOO VIN DIESEL.

04:20.961 --> 04:22.763
- XXX: STATE OF THE UNION.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.765
- WAY TOO VIN DIESEL.
- THE PACIFIER.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.133
- NOT VIN DIESEL ENOUGH.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.436
- VIN DIESEL.

04:28.469 --> 04:32.005
- VINCENT DIESEL.

04:32.039 --> 04:33.073
- YOU KNOW WHO I FEEL BAD FOR?

04:33.106 --> 04:34.608
I FEEL BAD FOR THAT APARTMENT.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.410
THAT IS ONE SEXY APARTMENT,
JOHN.

04:36.444 --> 04:39.079
THAT APARTMENT DESERVES TO HAVE
SEX IN IT EVERY SINGLE NIGHT.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.781
- WE ARE HAVING PLENTY OF SEX.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.450
IT'S JUST MORE SPACED OUT
THAN IT USED TO BE.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.685
- TELL THAT TO THE APARTMENT.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.354
GOT TO TAKE THAT APARTMENT
TO DINNER.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.589
GOT TO WINE
AND DINE THAT APARTMENT.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.791
MAKE THAT APARTMENT
FEEL SPECIAL.

04:50.824 --> 04:51.825
- YOU KNOW, I'VE ACTUALLY
GIVEN THIS A LOT OF THOUGHT.

04:51.859 --> 04:53.527
BEFORE THERESA
AND I MOVED IN TOGETHER,

04:53.561 --> 04:55.329
WE WOULD HAVE A TON OF SEX,
AND THEN WE'D BREAK UP

04:55.363 --> 04:57.030
AND WOULDN'T SEE EACH OTHER
FOR MONTHS.

04:57.064 --> 05:00.434
THEN WE'D GET BACK TOGETHER
AND MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME.

05:00.468 --> 05:02.936
SO IF YOU FACTOR
IN ALL THE BREAK-UPS

05:02.970 --> 05:04.137
AND THE DOWN TIME, WE'RE HAVING
EXACTLY THE SAME AMOUNT

05:04.171 --> 05:05.773
OF SEX WE'VE ALWAYS HAD.
- YEAH.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.207
- I ACTUALLY WORKED OUT
THE CALCULATIONS.

05:07.240 --> 05:09.810
- OH.
- WORKS OUT PERFECTLY.

05:09.843 --> 05:11.479
- YOU KNOW WHO CALCULATES
HOW MUCH SEX THEY'RE HAVING?

05:11.512 --> 05:13.381
- WHO?
- PEOPLE WHO AREN'T HAVING SEX.

05:13.414 --> 05:15.215
- HA-HA.
- PEOPLE WHO SIT ON THE COUCH

05:15.248 --> 05:16.717
WATCHING NETFLIX, EATING BEN
AND JERRY'S EVERY SINGLE NIGHT.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.318
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET TO ME,

05:18.352 --> 05:19.653
'CAUSE I ACTUALLY
LOVE LIVING WITH THERESA.

05:19.687 --> 05:21.188
FOR TWO YEARS,
I TRIED TO NOT DO IT,

05:21.221 --> 05:22.189
AND IT TURNS OUT SHE WAS RIGHT.
IT'S AWESOME.

05:22.222 --> 05:23.691
- BESIDES, SEX IS OVERRATED.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.793
I MEAN, LOOK AT ME AND VOODOO.

05:25.826 --> 05:27.861
WE'RE PERFECTLY HAPPY
IN OUR PLATONIC RELATIONSHIP.

05:27.895 --> 05:29.563
- OH, JUST RUB IT IN MY FACE,
BRIAN.

05:29.597 --> 05:31.298
- I DIDN'T DO THAT ON PURPOSE,
GABBY.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.367
- YOU COULD BE SO MUCH HAPPIER
WITH ME.

05:33.401 --> 05:34.568
- I DON'T KNOW.
I'M PRETTY HAPPY.

05:34.602 --> 05:36.837
- WELL, GIVE ME 48 HOURS.
- DAMN.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.406
- DAMN IS RIGHT, HANK.

05:38.439 --> 05:40.340
DAMN IS RIGHT.

05:41.742 --> 05:44.244
- FIRST OF ALL:
HOLY SH--.

05:44.277 --> 05:45.879
SECOND OF ALL:
DON'T COMPARE ME

05:45.913 --> 05:48.181
TO WHATEVER'S GOING ON
WITH YOU AND VOODOO.

05:48.215 --> 05:49.082
YOU'RE DATING AN ASEXUAL.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.884
YOU LITERALLY NEVER HAVE SEX.

05:50.918 --> 05:53.020
- OKAY, NO, WE DON'T HAVE SEX,
PER SE.

05:53.053 --> 05:55.589
BUT WHAT WE DO HAVE
IS ACTUALLY FAR MORE BEAUTIFUL.

05:55.623 --> 05:57.758
IN A WAY,
I DON'T EVEN MISS THE SEX.

05:57.791 --> 06:00.994
ME AND VOODOO, WE HAVE
THIS INTENSE SOUL CONNECTION

06:01.028 --> 06:03.030
THAT GOES
FAR BEYOND THE PHYSICAL.

06:03.063 --> 06:05.999
WE--WE'RE OPERATING
ON A HIGHER PLANE AND JUST--

06:06.033 --> 06:08.902
GOSH, I'M JUST--
I'M MASTURBATING ALL THE TIME.

06:08.936 --> 06:10.037
I MEAN, JUST--JUST CONSTANTLY.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.038
IT'S BAD, GUYS.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.740
I MEAN, I'M NOT PROUD OF IT.

06:12.773 --> 06:15.208
I JUST--I REALLY--
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

06:15.242 --> 06:17.110
- SEE?
JUST LIKE I SAID.

06:17.144 --> 06:18.746
PEOPLE CAN KID THEMSELVES,

06:18.779 --> 06:21.715
BUT THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE
FOR SEX.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.250
AND THAT'S WHY I'M
THE HAPPIEST GUY ON THE RIG,

06:23.283 --> 06:25.085
'CAUSE I'M HAVING SEX DAMN
NEAR EVERY NIGHT.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.788
- I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN MEANING
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING,

06:27.821 --> 06:29.557
HANK, AND YOU'VE JUST GIVEN
ME THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.692
DO YOU REMEMBER AFTER JEFF
THE CHEF'S WEDDING,

06:31.725 --> 06:35.195
YOU SAID YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED
IN SETTLING DOWN?

06:35.228 --> 06:36.797
- I WAS EMOTIONAL.
I SAID A LOT OF THINGS.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.231
- MM-HMM.
- YOU SPECIFICALLY ASKED US

06:38.265 --> 06:39.967
TO CALL YOU OUT
IF YOU FELL BACK INTO A PATTERN

06:40.000 --> 06:41.702
OF MEANINGLESS HOOK-UPS.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.437
JOHNNY, HAVE YOU BEEN
DETECTING A PATTERN?

06:43.471 --> 06:45.105
- I HAVE INDEED, MY FRIEND.
- YEAH.

06:45.138 --> 06:47.875
- JUST BECAUSE YOU TWO ARE
HAVING SEX-FREE RELATIONSHIPS,

06:47.908 --> 06:49.109
DON'T TRY TO DRAG ME DOWN, TOO.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.944
- I'M HAVING SEX.

06:53.814 --> 06:56.283
IT'S JUST MORE SPACED OUT
THAN IT USED TO BE, OKAY?

06:56.316 --> 06:57.618
- MM-HMM, MM.
- WHICH HE LIKES.

06:57.651 --> 06:59.553
- JUST--

06:59.587 --> 07:00.688
- [laughs]

07:07.761 --> 07:09.997
- SOY CARAMEL FRAPPUCINO.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.431
- THANKS, DUDE.

07:11.465 --> 07:13.967
HEY, I'M SORRY
I'VE BEEN SO LOW ENERGY.

07:14.001 --> 07:15.669
I'VE JUST BEEN HAVING A LOT
OF LATE NIGHTS LATELY,

07:15.703 --> 07:17.137
AND IT'S STARTING
TO TAKE ITS TOLL.

07:17.170 --> 07:18.438
- WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING?

07:18.472 --> 07:21.408
- AH, I PROBABLY
SHOULDN'T GET INTO IT.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.477
- EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?
- MM, MM-HMM.

07:23.511 --> 07:25.646
I'VE JUST BEEN HAVING A LOT
OF SEX WITH YOUR SISTER.

07:25.679 --> 07:28.749
IT'S BASICALLY, LIKE, CONSTANT.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.250
- LIKE, HOW MUCH SEX?

07:30.283 --> 07:32.152
- I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T TALK
ABOUT THIS.

07:32.185 --> 07:36.123
HEY, I MEAN, I THINK WE NEED
TO SET UP SOME GROUND RULES.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.257
YOU KNOW, LIKE, SOME BOUNDARIES

07:37.290 --> 07:39.259
WHEN IT COMES TO THAT KIND
OF TALK.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.261
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE MY PARTNER,
BUT I'M DATING YOUR SISTER,

07:41.294 --> 07:44.464
SO I FEEL LIKE WE SHOULD REALLY
TRY TO KEEP THINGS ABOVE BOARD.

07:44.498 --> 07:47.935
LIKE, I FEEL THAT ANY PERSONAL
INFORMATION OF THAT SORT

07:47.968 --> 07:51.104
SHOULD STAY STRICTLY OFF-LIMITS
FROM HERE ON OUT.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.907
IT'S BETWEEN MYSELF AND MAEVE
AND NO ONE ELSE.

07:57.678 --> 07:58.779
SIX TIMES A WEEK.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.013
NO, SEVEN.

08:00.047 --> 08:02.282
WAIT, LAST WEEK IT WAS TEN.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.017
IT'S AMAZING, T.
I'M SO HAPPY.

08:04.051 --> 08:05.152
WE HAD SEX OUTSIDE LAST NIGHT.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.820
- MAEVE HAD SEX OUTSIDE?

08:06.854 --> 08:08.488
- MM-HMM, RIGHT UNDER THE STARS.
- THAT IS SO WEIRD,

08:08.522 --> 08:10.057
BECAUSE AS A KID,
SHE WOULDN'T EVEN GO CAMPING.

08:10.090 --> 08:11.391
SHE DIDN'T WANT
TO GET HER CLOTHES DIRTY.

08:11.424 --> 08:13.293
- SHE WASN'T WEARING
NO CLOTHES, T.

08:13.326 --> 08:17.230
IT WAS CRAZY, THE MOONLIGHT
BOUNCING OFF HER PERFECT ASS.

08:17.264 --> 08:20.400
HER ASS, AYO MIO.
- OKAY.

08:20.433 --> 08:22.836
- THAT BUTT IS LIKE A PEACH...
- ALL RIGHT.

08:22.870 --> 08:24.471
- BUT THE RIPEST,

08:24.504 --> 08:27.074
MOST DELICIOUS PEACH
YOU'VE EVER TASTED, T.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.810
LIKE, I'M SORRY, I WISH I
COULD DESCRIBE IT BETTER TO YOU.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.612
- SHUT UP, BILLY.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.917
- WE NEED TO HAVE SEX RIGHT NOW.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.552
- YEAH.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.930
[long satisfied sigh]
WHAT PROMPTED THAT?

08:49.963 --> 08:51.231
- I JUST FELT LIKE WE WERE DUE,
YOU KNOW?

08:51.264 --> 08:52.900
- YEAH, TOTALLY.

08:52.933 --> 08:54.401
- DID YOU FEEL
LIKE WE WERE DUE, TOO?

08:54.434 --> 08:57.204
- NO, NOT REALLY, ANYWAY.

08:57.237 --> 08:58.405
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- I DON'T KNOW.

08:58.438 --> 09:01.208
I JUST THINK MAYBE, UH,

09:01.241 --> 09:04.912
WE SHOULD HAVE SEX OUTSIDE
SOMETIME.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.914
- REALLY?
- YEAH, WHY NOT?

09:06.947 --> 09:08.716
- NO REASON.

09:08.749 --> 09:10.083
OKAY, LET'S PUT
THAT ON THE LIST.

09:10.117 --> 09:11.619
- LET'S DO IT RIGHT NOW.
- NOW?

09:11.652 --> 09:14.688
- MM-HMM.
IF YOU CAN GO AGAIN.

09:14.722 --> 09:16.857
- I CAN ALWAYS GO AGAIN.
- LET'S GO.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.926
- I JUST--

09:18.959 --> 09:21.461
I JUST DON'T KNOW IF NOW, N-NOW,
NOW, NOW IS THE BEST TIME.

09:21.494 --> 09:24.031
- OH, RIGHT, YOU'RE SAYING NO
AFTER EVERYTHING

09:24.064 --> 09:27.234
THAT I DID FOR YOU.

09:27.267 --> 09:30.137
- I THINK THAT WE DID STUFF
FOR EACH OTHER.

09:30.170 --> 09:31.772
- UH-HUH.
- YUH-HUH.

09:31.805 --> 09:33.373
GRANTED, YOU DID A LOT
OF THE LEGWORK.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.375
- YEAH.
- AND THE ARM WORK.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.045
- AND--
- YEAH, AND--

09:38.078 --> 09:39.446
- YEAH.

09:39.479 --> 09:41.281
- OKAY, YEAH.
LET'S DO THIS,

09:41.314 --> 09:43.050
BUT JUST NOT IN THE BACKYARD
BECAUSE THE NEIGHBOR'S CAT

09:43.083 --> 09:45.085
SH--S BACK THERE.

09:45.118 --> 09:48.756
- YOU FEEL LIKE WE OPERATE ON,
LIKE, A HIGHER PLANE, RIGHT?

09:48.789 --> 09:50.457
- UH, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

09:50.490 --> 09:52.059
- I DON'T KNOW.
- YOU MEAN THE FACT THAT WE

09:52.092 --> 09:53.827
CAN BE INTIMATE WITH EACH OTHER
WITHOUT HAVING SEX?

09:53.861 --> 09:56.063
- YES.

09:56.096 --> 09:58.231
- IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN
BY "OPERATE ON A HIGHER PLANE,"

09:58.265 --> 09:59.399
THEN YEAH, SURE.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.534
- GREAT.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.006
SO WHEN WE'RE NOT TOGETHER,

10:06.039 --> 10:11.011
LIKE AFTER I LEAVE, DO YOU JUST
STAY ON THAT--THAT HIGHER PLANE?

10:11.044 --> 10:13.814
OR DO YOU EVER SLIDE DOWN TO,
LIKE,

10:13.847 --> 10:17.284
A--A LOWER PLANE,
LIKE DOWN BELOW,

10:17.317 --> 10:19.086
OR--

10:19.119 --> 10:21.755
- I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

10:21.789 --> 10:26.293
- I LOVE THAT WE OPERATE
ON A--A METAPHYSICAL LEVEL,

10:26.326 --> 10:30.998
BUT I ALSO OPERATE
ON A PHYSICAL LEVEL WITH MYSELF.

10:31.031 --> 10:32.499
DO YOU DO--DO YOU DO THAT?

10:32.532 --> 10:35.468
GET PHYSICAL WITH YOUR--
WITH YOURSELF?

10:35.502 --> 10:37.004
- ARE YOU ASKING
IF I MASTURBATE?

10:37.037 --> 10:38.872
- YES, YES I AM,
BECAUSE I DO IT ALL THE TIME,

10:38.906 --> 10:40.507
AND I JUST NEED TO KNOW
WHERE YOU'RE AT WITH THAT.

10:40.540 --> 10:44.344
- I DO SOMETIMES, YEAH.

10:44.377 --> 10:46.980
- OKAY.
OKAY.

10:47.014 --> 10:51.184
GOOD, BECAUSE I JUST NEEDED
TO KN--I--THANK YOU SO MUCH.

10:51.218 --> 10:52.485
THAT MAKES ME
FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.

10:52.519 --> 10:54.454
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
PHEW.

10:54.487 --> 10:55.856
- YEAH.

10:55.889 --> 10:57.457
RIGHT?
- OUT OF THE WAY.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.526
- OH, DONE WITH THAT CONVO.

11:06.666 --> 11:11.204
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT
WHEN YOU--WHEN YOU'RE DOING IT?

11:11.238 --> 11:12.740
- I DON'T REALLY
THINK ABOUT ANYTHING.

11:12.773 --> 11:17.077
IT'S JUST FOR THE PHYSICAL
SENSATION.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.545
AND, NO, I DON'T NEED ANYONE
ELSE TO DO IT FOR ME.

11:18.578 --> 11:19.847
- GREAT, GREAT.

11:19.880 --> 11:20.981
I--ME, NEITHER.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.784
I'M--I'M GREAT AT IT.

11:26.854 --> 11:30.090
- WHAT ABOUT OVER THERE?
- OH, TOO LOUD.

11:30.123 --> 11:32.325
- WHAT ABOUT OVER THERE?

11:32.359 --> 11:34.061
- UH, TOO QUIET.

11:34.094 --> 11:36.196
- WHAT ABOUT ON THAT ROOF?

11:36.229 --> 11:37.765
- OOH, TOO VIN DIESEL.
- [laughs]

11:37.798 --> 11:38.999
WELL, NOTHING'S GONNA
BE PERFECT, JOHN.

11:39.032 --> 11:40.567
THAT'S KIND OF THE POINT.

11:40.600 --> 11:44.371
SO LET'S GO AND DO IT
OVER IN THAT FIELD, HUH?

11:44.404 --> 11:46.740
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.
HMM.

11:46.774 --> 11:48.575
- WHAT'S WRONG?
- NOTHING'S WRONG.

11:48.608 --> 11:49.877
- YOU'RE BEING WEIRD.
- I'M NOT BEING WEIRD.

11:49.910 --> 11:51.678
- YOU ARE BEING WEIRD.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.213
I'M A COP, I KNOW WHEN PEOPLE
ARE BEING WEIRD.

11:53.246 --> 11:56.116
- WELL, APPARENTLY
NOT THIS TIME.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.419
- TELL ME.
- TELL YOU WHAT?

11:59.452 --> 12:02.189
- OR THERE'S NOT GONNA
BE ANY MORE PANCAKE SATURDAYS.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.191
- WHAT? YOU CAN'T TAKE AWAY
PANCAKE SATURDAYS.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.393
- SO, TELL ME.
TELL ME.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.095
- SANDY HANDY.

12:08.128 --> 12:09.696
- CAN'T HEAR YA.
- SANDY HANDY.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.432
I'VE NEVER TOLD ANYBODY
THIS BEFORE.

12:12.465 --> 12:16.103
- TOLD ANYBODY WHAT?

12:16.136 --> 12:17.404
- HIGH SCHOOL, SOPHOMORE YEAR,
SPRING BREAK,

12:17.437 --> 12:19.039
I MEET THIS GIRL ON A BEACH,

12:19.072 --> 12:21.541
AND SHE GIVES ME
MY FIRST RUB AND TUG.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.210
- YEAH?
- YEAH.

12:23.243 --> 12:26.880
SHE'S GOT SAND
ALL OVER HER HAND.

12:26.914 --> 12:31.384
AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE,
THAT DOES NOT FEEL GOOD.

12:31.418 --> 12:32.986
BUT I'M TRYING TO BE NICE.

12:33.020 --> 12:35.222
I TRY TO JUST, LIKE,
GO WITH IT FOR A WHILE.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.556
- MM-HMM.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.591
- THE CHAFING GETS SO BAD.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.327
AND ON TOP OF IT, I THINK
SHE'S GOT SUNBLOCK ON HER HANDS.

12:40.360 --> 12:42.796
- NO! NO!
- IT STARTS BURNING LIKE CRAZY,

12:42.830 --> 12:45.765
AND I JUST START
SCREAMING SO LOUD.

12:45.799 --> 12:47.400
I SCARE THAT POOR GIRL
HALF TO DEATH.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.602
- OH, YOU POOR THING.
- AND THEN ALL THE SUDDEN,

12:49.636 --> 12:52.339
THIS GROUP OF SENIORS
ON A HOTEL BALCONY

12:52.372 --> 12:54.574
START LAUGHING THEIR ASSES OFF.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.410
TURNS OUT THEY WERE WATCHING
THE WHOLE THING,

12:57.444 --> 12:58.311
AND THEY START SCREAMING,

12:58.345 --> 13:00.413
"SANDY HANDY!

13:00.447 --> 13:01.414
SANDY HANDY!"

13:01.448 --> 13:03.616
- NO! OH, GOD.
HOLY SH--.

13:03.650 --> 13:05.418
- I'VE NEVER BEEN SO EMBARRASSED
IN MY WHOLE LIFE.

13:05.452 --> 13:08.088
THAT WAS THE LAST TIME I EVER
DID ANYTHING LIKE THAT OUTSIDE.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.623
SO NOW YOU KNOW.

13:10.657 --> 13:13.626
- HONESTLY, JOHN, I AM PERFECTLY
HAPPY WITH OUR SEX LIFE.

13:13.660 --> 13:15.695
- GOOD, ME TOO.

13:18.365 --> 13:19.666
- I MEAN, THE ONLY REASON I
SAID ANYTHING IN THE FIRST PLACE

13:19.699 --> 13:21.434
WAS BECAUSE BILLY TOLD ME

13:21.468 --> 13:24.437
THAT HE AND MAEVE HAD SEX
OUTSIDE THE OTHER DAY.

13:24.471 --> 13:27.774
YEAH, I THINK I WAS JUST BEING
WEIRDLY COMPETITIVE WITH THEM.

13:27.807 --> 13:28.942
I MEAN,
WHO CARES IF WE'RE HAVING SEX

13:28.976 --> 13:30.543
LESS THAN WE USED TO, RIGHT?

13:30.577 --> 13:32.279
- WE DON'T HAVE SEX
LESS THAN WE USED TO.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.480
IT'S THE SAME AMOUNT.
IT'S JUST MORE SPACED OUT.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.215
- OKAY.
- NO, IT'S NOT OKAY.

13:35.248 --> 13:36.984
WE'RE HAVING THE SAME AMOUNT
OF SEX.

13:37.017 --> 13:38.118
I WORKED IT OUT.
- OKAY.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.486
EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.321
- WHY DO YOU SAY IT
LIKE IT'S NOT?

13:41.354 --> 13:42.990
BE HONEST WITH ME, DO YOU THINK
OUR SEX LIFE HAS GOTTEN BORING?

13:43.023 --> 13:44.557
- NO.

13:44.591 --> 13:46.393
- I FEEL LIKE YOU HESITATED.

13:46.426 --> 13:47.394
- DID I?
- I DON'T KNOW, DID YOU?

13:47.427 --> 13:49.229
- OKAY, THIS IS CRAZY.

13:49.262 --> 13:51.031
I LOVE YOU.

13:51.064 --> 13:53.500
OUR SEX LIFE IS PERFECTLY FINE.
- FINE.

13:53.533 --> 13:56.003
- OH, STOP.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.670
- THEN PICK BETTER WORDS.

14:01.741 --> 14:04.878
- SO AM I GONNA SEE YOU AGAIN?

14:04.912 --> 14:06.346
- MY BEST FRIEND LIVES
IN THE BUILDING.

14:06.379 --> 14:07.380
DEFINITELY.
- OH, RIGHT.

14:07.414 --> 14:09.249
- MM-HMM.
MM-HMM.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.084
- WOW, IT'S GONNA BE AWKWARD
IF WE STOP HOOKING UP.

14:11.118 --> 14:12.419
- OH, NOT FOR ME, IT WON'T.

14:12.452 --> 14:13.720
- OH, NOT FOR ME, EITHER.

14:13.753 --> 14:16.924
I WAS JUST SAYING
THAT TO BE NICE.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.658
- HEY, SPEAKING OF JOHNNY,

14:18.691 --> 14:20.227
WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE DON'T MENTION THIS TO HIM

14:20.260 --> 14:21.861
AND THERESA FOR THE TIME BEING?

14:21.895 --> 14:23.563
- WHAT, ARE YOU ASHAMED OF ME?
- OF COURSE NOT.

14:23.596 --> 14:25.432
I'M ASHAMED OF THE THINGS
I'M GONNA DO TO YOU.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.100
- OH.

14:27.134 --> 14:28.368
[chuckling]

14:28.401 --> 14:30.037
- MMM.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.838
WHAT THINGS?

14:31.871 --> 14:33.340
- WHAT YOU WANT, A SPREADSHEET?
YOU GONNA FIND OUT.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.475
- [laughs]

14:42.449 --> 14:44.084
- SANDY HANDY, MAN.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.285
THAT SOUNDS TRAUMATIC.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.287
- I KNOW.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.589
- I ACTUALLY THINK I UNDERSTAND
JOHNNY A LITTLE BETTER NOW,

14:49.622 --> 14:50.557
LIKE WHAT MAKES HIM TICK.

14:50.590 --> 14:53.093
- REALLY?
HOW?

14:53.126 --> 14:55.362
- WELL, YOU KNOW, I MEAN,

14:55.395 --> 14:57.430
A GIRL JERKED HIM OFF WITH SAND
ON HER HAND,

14:57.464 --> 15:00.100
AND NOW HE'S A PRETTY COOL DUDE.

15:00.133 --> 15:01.969
- AND YOU THINK THOSE TWO THINGS
ARE RELATED?

15:02.002 --> 15:03.203
- ABSOLUTELY.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.972
- HMM.

15:05.005 --> 15:08.441
- WELL, MAYBE NOT, YOU KNOW?

15:08.475 --> 15:11.778
* SANDY, SANDY, SANDY HANDY

15:11.811 --> 15:15.315
* YO, YO, SANDRA, SANDRA,
SANDRA HANDRA *

15:15.348 --> 15:16.549
- OH, YOU CAN'T TELL ANYONE
I TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT.

15:16.583 --> 15:19.219
- OF COURSE NOT, T.

15:19.252 --> 15:21.621
- SANDY HANDY, THAT IS AWESOME.

15:21.654 --> 15:23.423
- OH, BABE, I JUST REMEMBERED.

15:23.456 --> 15:25.325
I WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO TELL ANYONE.

15:25.358 --> 15:27.794
- WELL, OBVIOUSLY
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME.

15:27.827 --> 15:30.163
- YEAH, I GUESS YOU'RE RIGHT.

15:30.197 --> 15:32.399
- OH, AND WE HAVE TO TELL CASH.

15:32.432 --> 15:35.402
- TELL ME WHAT?

15:35.435 --> 15:37.270
BACK IN THE WAR, I HAD SEX

15:37.304 --> 15:40.573
IN A RICE PADDY WITH THIS FINE
LITTLE VIETNAMESE WOMAN.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.175
WHOO, I KNEW IT WAS DANGEROUS,

15:42.209 --> 15:43.610
BUT I WAS YOUNG AND IN LOVE,

15:43.643 --> 15:45.312
AND YOU COULDN'T
TELL ME NOTHING.

15:45.345 --> 15:48.581
SO WE'RE LAYING THERE,
DOING OUR THING IN THE RICE.

15:48.615 --> 15:50.650
ALL OF A SUDDEN,
I HEARD A GUNSHOT.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.319
POW!
SHOT RIGHT IN THE ASS.

15:52.352 --> 15:53.653
- VIET CONG?

15:53.686 --> 15:55.288
- NO, WORSE, HER HUSBAND.

15:55.322 --> 15:56.856
[laughter]

15:56.889 --> 15:58.325
- OH, LOOK WHO IT IS!
IT'S SANDY HANDY!

15:58.358 --> 16:01.428

16:09.302 --> 16:12.672
THANK YOU ALL FOR THIS.

16:12.705 --> 16:15.175
- HELLO?
- HEY, LISTEN TO THIS.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.309
all: SANDY HANDY!

16:16.343 --> 16:20.313
SANDY HANDY!
- OH, NO.

16:20.347 --> 16:21.681
- WHY WOULD YOU TELL ANYONE
THAT STORY?

16:21.714 --> 16:23.283
- I DON'T KNOW.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.185
UH, IT SLIPPED OUT?

16:25.218 --> 16:26.519
BUT, HEY, IT'S A COOL STORY.

16:26.553 --> 16:28.621
I MEAN, IT MAKES YOU SOUND COOL.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.057
YOU WERE GETTING HANDJOBS AT 15.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.491
- I HOPE IT
DOESN'T BECOME A NICKNAME.

16:31.524 --> 16:33.026
- PAGING SANDY HANDY.
- OH, MY GOD. BYE.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.395
- AMBULANCE NEEDED,
428 SCHOVILLE.

16:35.428 --> 16:36.563
WITNESSES--
- LET'S GO, SANDY.

16:36.596 --> 16:37.397
- OH.
YOU--

16:40.900 --> 16:44.071
- PARAMEDICS.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.406
PARAMEDICS.
YOU WANT THIS ONE, SANDY?

16:46.439 --> 16:48.741
- BITE ME, AND YES.

16:52.745 --> 16:53.646
HELLO?

16:53.680 --> 16:56.316
- DOWN HERE!

16:56.349 --> 16:58.218
- HELLO?

17:01.521 --> 17:04.191
WHOA, WHAT HAPPENED HERE?

17:04.224 --> 17:05.492
- WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE?

17:05.525 --> 17:06.826
- I HAVE NO IDEA.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.428
- LET ME TAKE A STAB AT IT.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.563
YOU TWO WERE DOING
A LITTLE ROLEPLAYING,

17:10.597 --> 17:12.532
AND IT GOT OUT OF HAND.
- YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.

17:12.565 --> 17:16.503
- SUPERMAN WAS COMING TO RESCUE
YOU FROM AN ARCH-NEMESIS, SAY,

17:16.536 --> 17:19.239
LEX LUTHOR, AND HE GOT HIT
WITH A LITTLE KRYPTONITE, RIGHT?

17:19.272 --> 17:21.741
- NO, HE GOT HIT WITH THE FAN.

17:21.774 --> 17:24.377
HE TRIED TO JUMP OFF
THE DRESSER.

17:24.411 --> 17:28.115
- HE'S BREATHING, JUST OUT COLD.

17:28.148 --> 17:28.781
- HEY, BRO.
- OH, HE'S GONNA BE FINE.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.517
- THERE YOU GO, BUDDY. HI.

17:30.550 --> 17:34.787
- WELCOME BACK.

17:34.821 --> 17:36.189
HEY, HOW LONG HAVE YOU TWO BEEN
TOGETHER?

17:36.223 --> 17:37.390
- OH, ABOUT TWO YEARS,
RIGHT, HONEY?

17:37.424 --> 17:38.891
- YEAH.
WE JUST MOVED IN TOGETHER.

17:38.925 --> 17:40.593
- DON'T TRY TO DRAW A PARALLEL.

17:40.627 --> 17:42.295
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
- OH, CAUTIONARY TALE, JOHN.

17:42.329 --> 17:43.896
CAUTIONARY TALE.

17:43.930 --> 17:45.798
- MY ONLY QUESTION
IS HOW YOU MANAGED TO CALL 911

17:45.832 --> 17:46.866
WITH YOUR HANDS TIED.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.768
- HEY!
IS HE OKAY?

17:48.801 --> 17:52.272
- HE'S OKAY, GARY!

17:52.305 --> 17:56.209
WE LET HIM WATCH SOMETIMES.
- OH.

17:56.243 --> 17:58.445
- CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?
WHY SUPERMAN?

17:58.478 --> 17:59.546
- FIRST OF ALL,
I'M NOT SUPERMAN.

17:59.579 --> 18:00.780
I'M SUPER-JIM.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.915
- BUT YOU HAVE A RED CAPE.

18:02.949 --> 18:05.051
- CLEARLY THERE'S A SUPERMAN
INFLUENCE.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.753
- WITH A SUBTLE NOD
TO THE FLASH.

18:06.786 --> 18:07.754
- I MADE HIM THE COSTUME.

18:07.787 --> 18:09.322
- GIRL, SUPERMAN IS VANILLA.

18:09.356 --> 18:10.923
IF I COULD DATE A SUPERHERO,
I WOULD DATE BATMAN.

18:10.957 --> 18:12.959
HE'S RICH, HE'S MYSTERIOUS,

18:12.992 --> 18:15.462
HE HAS ISSUES.
THAT'S A GOOD TIME.

18:15.495 --> 18:16.896
- BATMAN DOESN'T HAVE
ANY SPECIAL POWERS.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.898
- NEITHER DOES HE.
- HE'S GOT A POINT, HON.

18:18.931 --> 18:20.567
MAYBE NEXT TIME,
I CAN BE BATMAN.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.601
- SEE, I WAS THINKING AQUAMAN.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.336
- OH, I LIKE IT.

18:23.370 --> 18:26.606
- AQUAMAN'S, LIKE, THE LAMEST
SUPERHERO OF ALL TIME.

18:26.639 --> 18:29.509
- HE DOESN'T HAVE TO COME UP
FOR AIR.

18:29.542 --> 18:30.743
- OH.
- OH.

18:30.777 --> 18:34.414
- [chuckles]
- MAN, YEAH.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.649
- DOCTOR'LL BE HERE ANY SECOND.

18:36.683 --> 18:39.619
YOU KNOW, UM...

18:39.652 --> 18:41.421
LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.756
WAS IT REALLY WORTH IT?
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

18:43.790 --> 18:46.259
- COME ON. YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET
AN MRI DRESSED AS A SUPERHERO.

18:46.293 --> 18:49.662
IS ALL THIS COSTUME SH--
WORTH THE HASSLE?

18:49.696 --> 18:53.132
- HEY, I GOT A GIRLFRIEND WHO'S
INTO SUPERHEROES.

18:53.166 --> 18:56.436
AND IN CASE YOU COULDN'T TELL,
SHE'S A LITTLE OUT OF MY LEAGUE.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.104
- YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S SMOKING HOT.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.939
- SO IF I HAVE TO DO SOME WEIRD
STUFF FROM TIME TO TIME

18:59.972 --> 19:01.774
TO KEEP HER HAPPY,
AM I GONNA DO THAT?

19:01.808 --> 19:03.009
- MM-HMM.
- HELL YEAH.

19:03.042 --> 19:04.844
- OH, YEAH, YOU ARE.
- I SUCK IT UP.

19:04.877 --> 19:07.447
I LITERALLY SUCK IT UP
TO GET THIS RIDICULOUS COSTUME

19:07.480 --> 19:09.782
OVER MY EXTREMELY AVERAGE
PHYSIQUE.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.851
I MEAN, I GOT A NICE ASS,
BUT I GOT BIRD LEGS.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.220
- I THINK YOU LOOK GREAT.
- I'M SKINNY-FAT.

19:13.253 --> 19:14.854
- NO, I THINK YOU LOOK GREAT.
- THANK YOU,

19:14.887 --> 19:15.855
BUT I LOOK LIKE KEVIN BACON
HAD SEX WITH A RABBIT.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.624
- THAT'S TRUE.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.559
- YOU HAVE A LADY?
- YEAH, I GOT A LADY.

19:19.592 --> 19:21.861
- THEN YOU KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

19:21.894 --> 19:23.996
YOU CAN'T BE
CLARK KENT EVERY DAY.

19:24.030 --> 19:27.400
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO MAN UP
AND STEP INTO THE PHONE BOOTH.

19:27.434 --> 19:29.969
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.871
WHERE DOES SUPERMAN CHANGE NOW?

19:31.904 --> 19:33.039
- YOU KNOW, I WAS THINKING
ABOUT THAT THE OTHER DAY.

19:33.072 --> 19:34.474
- YEAH.
- PROBABLY, LIKE,

19:34.507 --> 19:36.042
A PORTA-POTTY.
- PROBABLY, RIGHT?

19:36.075 --> 19:37.877
THAT MAKES SENSE.
- YEAH.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.884
- YOU KNOW, WE DON'T ACTUALLY

19:44.917 --> 19:47.019
HAVE TO DO THIS IF YOU'RE
UNCOMFORTABLE, OKAY, JOHN?

19:47.053 --> 19:48.688
- NO, AND I LIKE IT.
IT'S KIND OF PRIMAL.

19:48.721 --> 19:50.490
- RIGHT? LIKE WE'RE
IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.824
- YEAH.
- LIKE I'M EVE AND YOU'RE ADAM.

19:51.858 --> 19:53.560
- YEAH, WATCH OUT FOR THE SNAKE.

19:53.593 --> 19:54.994
- OOH, OH.

19:55.027 --> 19:59.031
[giggling]

19:59.065 --> 20:00.900
- OW, DID YOU PINCH IT?
OW.

20:00.933 --> 20:03.202
- NO, YOU TOLD ME
YOU DON'T LIKE THAT.

20:03.236 --> 20:05.171
- OW, NO, JUST WAIT A SECOND.
- NO, COME ON...OW.

20:05.204 --> 20:08.408
- I THINK IT WAS A BEE.
- WHAT?

20:08.441 --> 20:10.042
- AH!
- REALLY?

20:10.076 --> 20:13.846
- A BEE JUST STUNG MY DICK.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.915
- WHERE'S YOUR EPIPEN?
- IT'S AT HOME.

20:15.948 --> 20:18.285
OH.
OW.

20:18.318 --> 20:20.052
- IT'S REALLY SWELLING, TOO.
- I KNOW, I GOT TO CALL HANK.

20:20.086 --> 20:21.888
I DON'T WANT TO--
I DON'T WANT TO CALL HANK.

20:21.921 --> 20:23.256
- OH, IT'S OKAY.
MY MOM'S GOT AN EPIPEN.

20:23.290 --> 20:24.291
WE'LL CALL HER.
- YEAH, HEY, THERESA,

20:24.324 --> 20:26.893
THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A SECOND.

20:26.926 --> 20:28.295
- CALL HANK.
- YEAH.

20:28.328 --> 20:29.929
- THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE
HARVESTED BY PIGS,

20:29.962 --> 20:31.731
MUCH LIKE THE TRUFFLE.

20:31.764 --> 20:34.634
- HMM.
[phone ringing]

20:34.667 --> 20:35.868
HELLO?

20:35.902 --> 20:36.936
- HANK, I NEED YOU
TO GET AN EPIPEN

20:36.969 --> 20:37.937
AND GET TO PORTER'S PARK.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.772
- WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

20:39.806 --> 20:42.742
- I GOT STUNG BY A BEE
SOMEWHERE VERY SENSITIVE.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.944
- HOW SENSITIVE?
- JUST HURRY UP, PLEASE.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.779
- DID YOU GET STUNG
BY A BEE ON YOUR DICK?

20:46.813 --> 20:47.914
- LOOK, I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.749
JUST GET DOWN HERE, PLEASE.

20:51.851 --> 20:53.753
- OH.
I GOT TO GO.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.555
- DID YOU SAY A BEE--
- I'LL BE BACK.

20:55.588 --> 20:56.956
- I MEAN, IT'S REALLY SWELLING.

20:56.989 --> 20:57.757
- I KNOW.
I KNOW.

20:57.790 --> 21:00.627
- IT'S HUGE.

21:00.660 --> 21:01.961
YOU'RE, LIKE, SUPERDICK.

21:01.994 --> 21:03.630
- I LIKE THAT.
- YEAH.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.598
- THINK YOU CAN GET
THAT NICKNAME TO STICK?

21:05.632 --> 21:08.568
- OH, THAT SANDY HANDY THING
HAS REALLY CAUGHT ON, HUH?

21:08.601 --> 21:10.403
- NOT YET,
BUT IT'S GETTING THERE.

21:10.437 --> 21:11.838
OW.
- WE SHOULD GET A PHOTO.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.306
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
DON'T.

21:13.340 --> 21:14.741
- SHH.
- DON'T--OKAY, JUST REAL QUICK.

21:14.774 --> 21:15.742
- YOU'RE BEING A BABY.
IT'S JUST A BEE.

21:15.775 --> 21:16.809
- JUST REAL QUICK.

21:16.843 --> 21:18.678
- ALL RIGHT.

21:18.711 --> 21:20.146
- OKAY.

21:20.179 --> 21:21.948
- IT DOESN'T FIT IN THE SCREEN.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.616
- NO, NO, THAT'S T--YOU GOT
TO GO FOR THE HIGH ANGLE.

21:23.650 --> 21:25.952
- HIGH ANGLE, HIGH ANGLE.
- EVERYBODY KNOWS, HIGH ANGLE.

21:25.985 --> 21:29.356
- DICK SELFIES.
- OW.
