You're awake.

00:49.304 --> 00:51.410
Every time I visit,
he's asleep.

00:51.444 --> 00:52.618
I wonder why.

00:54.585 --> 00:55.862
Did the doctors come by?

00:55.897 --> 00:56.898
They did.

01:00.281 --> 01:01.558
And?

01:01.592 --> 01:03.594
And he getting better.

01:03.629 --> 01:06.597
But he must avoid all stress.

01:07.391 --> 01:08.910
You're stress.

01:08.944 --> 01:12.051
Coming from you, Maciek,
that's pretty rich.

01:12.085 --> 01:13.777
The first time I meet you,

01:13.811 --> 01:14.847
I tell him,

01:14.881 --> 01:16.642
"Don't marry her.

01:16.676 --> 01:19.265
"She will be
great big ball-ache."

01:19.300 --> 01:23.235
"She will make your life
a total nightmare."

01:47.673 --> 01:49.916
It's so good to see your eyes.

01:54.783 --> 01:57.717
I am gonna find out

Let's sit over there,
shall we?

03:08.898 --> 03:10.210
It's more comfortable.

03:14.214 --> 03:16.216
I've wanted to meet
you for a long time.

03:17.113 --> 03:18.356
I've been watching you.

03:20.013 --> 03:23.533
Er, watching in a kinky way?

03:23.982 --> 03:25.501
You're remarkable.

03:28.953 --> 03:30.920
Are you trying to seduce me?

03:35.097 --> 03:36.270
Excuse me.

03:50.284 --> 03:51.484
What is your name?

03:51.976 --> 03:53.149
Helene.

03:54.150 --> 03:55.324
Helene.

03:56.532 --> 03:57.705
Is that your real name?

03:59.535 --> 04:01.778
Do you know why I wanted
to meet you in person?

04:05.886 --> 04:07.232
To watch me some more?

04:09.648 --> 04:11.685
I wanted to
tell you face to face

04:11.719 --> 04:13.204
that your request

04:13.238 --> 04:14.550
has been successful.

04:21.522 --> 04:22.592
It's official.

04:37.055 --> 04:40.058
To Villanelle, the Keeper.

04:51.173 --> 04:55.177
Your first assignment in
your new role is very exciting.

04:55.211 --> 04:57.455
A big job that will
cause a great stir.

05:07.327 --> 05:09.467
A politician in Romania.

05:22.135 --> 05:23.929
I was told I would be
giving orders.

05:24.585 --> 05:25.586
By who?

05:29.107 --> 05:31.420
This is the same stuff
I was doing before.

05:32.283 --> 05:33.732
This is bullshit.

05:39.738 --> 05:41.058
You bargained
for what you wanted,

05:41.085 --> 05:42.431
and we're giving it to you.

05:42.465 --> 05:45.089
You'll get all the material
perks you were expecting.

05:45.123 --> 05:46.573
What more do you want?

05:50.163 --> 05:51.509
Enjoy Romania.

06:00.345 --> 06:02.244
So, if the texts
weren't from Niko...

06:02.278 --> 06:03.555
Villanelle must have sent them.

06:03.590 --> 06:06.041
Making Eve
go to Poland to see...

06:06.075 --> 06:07.801
Her husband being pitchforked.

06:10.052 --> 06:10.915
Sorry.

06:11.258 --> 06:12.898
Which means Villanelle is...

06:12.923 --> 06:15.339
Stark raving mad.

06:15.740 --> 06:18.053
This can't be about the bus.

06:18.708 --> 06:19.571
What bus?

06:19.606 --> 06:20.883
What did you do on the bus?

06:20.917 --> 06:23.058
She knows she can't touch him.

06:23.092 --> 06:24.852
What's she saying here?

06:24.887 --> 06:27.717
Er, she's saying
she's "still got it."

06:29.719 --> 06:31.480
Actually, if she
still did have it,

06:31.514 --> 06:33.758
he'd be dead
and not just pitchforked.

06:39.212 --> 06:40.385
Sorry.

06:42.456 --> 06:44.458
Maybe she's trying
to torture you.

06:45.770 --> 06:46.805
Not like this.

06:47.979 --> 06:49.084
Am I being too harsh?

06:49.118 --> 06:50.568
Wait, what's this?

06:53.398 --> 06:54.434
Bertha Kruger.

06:54.468 --> 06:55.538
The wife of Charles,

06:55.573 --> 06:57.713
the, er, accountant
for The Twelve.

06:59.956 --> 07:01.199
Killed in Lyon.

07:01.234 --> 07:02.925
When? BEAR: Last week,

07:02.959 --> 07:04.099
when you were gone.

07:42.551 --> 07:43.931
Are you okay?

07:43.966 --> 07:45.140
I just want a muffin.

07:47.625 --> 07:49.592
No one usually gets those.

07:51.318 --> 07:54.425
Ugh. Yeah.
Jan, 2011.

07:56.772 --> 07:57.842
Here.

08:05.988 --> 08:07.541
You know that it would be okay

08:07.576 --> 08:09.440
if you're not okay.

08:09.474 --> 08:11.200
That is...

08:11.235 --> 08:13.858
I mean, aside from
Kenny dying which,

08:13.892 --> 08:14.755
let's face it,

08:14.790 --> 08:16.378
is a bit of a blow.

08:16.412 --> 08:17.689
And being lured to Poland

08:17.724 --> 08:19.253
because you thought your
husband wanted you back,

08:19.277 --> 08:21.900
when really it was just
to see him being punctured.

08:23.178 --> 08:24.593
You're alone,
homeless,

08:24.627 --> 08:25.732
and trying to figure out

08:25.766 --> 08:27.734
who's killed all your friends.

08:27.768 --> 08:29.391
I mean,
I'd be a total wreck.

08:29.425 --> 08:31.186
Why won't you give me a break?

08:31.220 --> 08:33.460
Sometimes you just
need to let it win.

08:44.820 --> 08:45.855
Hmm.

08:48.444 --> 08:49.928
I wanted to show you this.

08:51.827 --> 08:53.725
Dasha Duzran.

08:53.760 --> 08:56.797
That's who's responsible
for the '70s gymnast kill.

08:56.832 --> 08:58.454
At least, that's what
all the rumors say.

08:58.489 --> 09:00.076
Who is she?

09:00.111 --> 09:01.285
An Olympic gymnast,

09:01.319 --> 09:03.321
who supposedly
works for the KGB.

09:03.356 --> 09:05.979
They say it was The Chalk Kill

09:06.013 --> 09:07.222
that got her recruited.

09:08.464 --> 09:10.328
Why would
Villanelle imitate her?

09:10.363 --> 09:12.434
Flattery and all that.

09:12.468 --> 09:13.676
Hardly.

09:14.781 --> 09:15.644
Where is this?

09:15.678 --> 09:17.577
Oh, that's in Barcelona.

09:17.611 --> 09:20.580
Yeah. She teaches
wee kids to do roly-polies.

09:22.237 --> 09:23.686
Wha-what?

09:39.909 --> 09:40.807
Eve.

09:40.841 --> 09:43.154
Tell me everything
about Dasha Duzran.

09:47.331 --> 09:51.266
I'm afraid you've
interrupted a rather delicate operation.

09:51.300 --> 09:53.440
Drought can be endured,

09:53.475 --> 09:56.236
but rot is an instant killer.

09:57.996 --> 09:58.997
Dasha.

09:59.860 --> 10:00.723
Oh, yes.

10:00.758 --> 10:02.000
Well, I first met her

10:02.035 --> 10:04.417
when she had just been
kicked out of the KGB.

10:04.451 --> 10:06.004
Sorrento.

10:06.039 --> 10:08.189
And the weather was
unusually hot for that time of year,

10:08.213 --> 10:09.870
and I waited for her at a cafe.

10:10.906 --> 10:12.010
And before she sat down,

10:12.045 --> 10:14.081
she plucked a lemon from a tree,

10:14.116 --> 10:17.257
and took the most
enormous bite out of it,

10:18.534 --> 10:20.053
rind and all.

10:21.710 --> 10:22.987
Why do you want to know?

10:25.714 --> 10:28.682
I think she's running
Villanelle out of Barcelona.

10:29.442 --> 10:31.754
Well, that is
a heady combination.

10:31.789 --> 10:34.343
Villanelle and Dasha.
Volatile.

10:34.378 --> 10:35.448
If I'm right,

10:35.482 --> 10:37.622
Dasha knows where
Villanelle was last week.

10:37.657 --> 10:39.969
Because, I don't think she
was the one who attacked Niko.

10:40.004 --> 10:40.867
Interesting.

10:40.901 --> 10:42.420
I think she was
in Lyon at the time,

10:42.455 --> 10:43.663
killing Bertha Kruger.

10:45.009 --> 10:47.908
I hope that doesn't mean you're
thinking of going to Barcelona.

10:47.943 --> 10:49.427
Someone tried
to kill my husband,

10:49.462 --> 10:51.049
I intend to find out who.

10:53.983 --> 10:55.951
But if it's The Twelve, Eve...

10:58.367 --> 10:59.575
Does it really matter who?

11:05.409 --> 11:07.307
I could say
the same about Kenny.

11:13.934 --> 11:15.833
Just be very careful of Dasha.

11:18.491 --> 11:21.148
She was the KGB's top assassin,

11:22.426 --> 11:24.048
until she killed
one of their own.

11:25.152 --> 11:27.223
I mean,
that's why she was exiled.

12:09.300 --> 12:11.647
Irina!

12:25.074 --> 12:26.362
What are you doing?

12:26.386 --> 12:28.353
I love
hockey! Irina's good.

12:28.388 --> 12:29.700
That was the other team.

12:30.390 --> 12:31.564
It is? Yes.

12:31.598 --> 12:34.359
Oh. Go, other team!

12:34.394 --> 12:35.775
Villanelle.

12:35.809 --> 12:37.501
Do they sell hot dogs here?

12:37.535 --> 12:39.917
You can't watch sports
without a hot dog.

12:39.951 --> 12:42.367
Villanelle!
What is going on?

12:43.368 --> 12:44.680
I'm coming with you.

12:45.716 --> 12:47.649
Your plan to get out?
I'm in.

12:48.684 --> 12:49.754
You're in?

12:49.789 --> 12:51.307
It's exciting, huh?

12:52.205 --> 12:53.240
How was your trip?

12:53.275 --> 12:56.485
Er, turns out I'm excellent
at dung-throwing.

12:59.074 --> 13:00.144
And your mother?

13:13.709 --> 13:15.193
No, Villanelle.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.333
She deserved it.

13:18.369 --> 13:19.784
Of course,
she deserved it.

13:20.544 --> 13:22.511
Everyone's mother deserves it.

13:22.546 --> 13:25.169
But you're not
supposed to do it.

13:25.203 --> 13:26.688
You are supposed to grow up

13:26.722 --> 13:28.942
and realize she isn't actually
evil. I don't want to talk about it.

13:28.966 --> 13:31.313
I don't want
to talk about it! She's just insane.

13:33.142 --> 13:35.490
Where are we going?

13:35.524 --> 13:37.112
It better be some place hot.

13:38.354 --> 13:39.390
No, it's too late.

13:39.424 --> 13:41.185
You haven't even left.

13:41.219 --> 13:43.394
It's too dangerous
for us all to go together.

13:46.293 --> 13:49.676
Konstantin, please.

13:53.473 --> 13:54.819
I send for you.

13:55.164 --> 13:56.476
Er, no.

13:58.029 --> 13:59.030
No.

13:59.824 --> 14:01.067
We can't go together.

14:01.101 --> 14:03.000
They will be on to us
before we get there.

14:03.034 --> 14:03.897
Get where?

14:03.932 --> 14:05.381
You will know
when I send for you.

14:05.416 --> 14:07.418
Hmm, we'll go.

14:08.419 --> 14:10.110
Then, you can send for Irina.

14:11.595 --> 14:12.734
I can't do that.

14:14.839 --> 14:17.532
Once we're safe,
you'll come. I promise.

14:19.603 --> 14:20.776
I don't believe you.

14:20.811 --> 14:23.123
But that's the only
way we'll make it.

14:23.158 --> 14:25.540
You haven't told anyone
about this, have you?

14:28.473 --> 14:29.647
Of course not.

14:29.682 --> 14:32.512
Don't let them see you
even think about getting out.

14:32.547 --> 14:33.720
Do you hear me?

14:33.755 --> 14:36.102
They'd kill you the
second they realize...

14:37.552 --> 14:38.656
Oh, Irina.

14:38.691 --> 14:39.702
Because of her.

14:39.726 --> 14:40.945
I just scored
in the final minute,

14:40.969 --> 14:42.315
and you missed it.

14:42.349 --> 14:43.385
That was good.

14:43.419 --> 14:44.800
He's a really shit father.

14:44.835 --> 14:45.974
You should run away.

14:46.008 --> 14:48.355
What is she doing here?

14:48.390 --> 14:51.186
Er, I'm planning
our travel arrangements.

14:51.220 --> 14:52.877
Please tell me you're joking.

14:52.912 --> 14:54.051
She is joking.

14:54.085 --> 14:55.639
I'm not going if she's with us.

14:55.673 --> 14:57.917
Great!
Problem solved.

14:57.951 --> 14:59.125
When do we leave?

14:59.159 --> 15:01.058
Irina, you go and get changed.

15:01.092 --> 15:02.646
We'll talk about this later.

15:02.680 --> 15:03.854
Go.

15:06.442 --> 15:08.444
I don't
think you really want this.

15:08.479 --> 15:11.620
I want it!

15:11.655 --> 15:12.863
You know what it means?

15:12.897 --> 15:15.520
It means you have
to leave everything,

15:15.555 --> 15:19.421
the clothes,
apartment... and her.

15:19.455 --> 15:20.456
I know.

15:25.910 --> 15:30.363
Don't let them see
something's up.

15:30.397 --> 15:31.675
Promise me.

15:31.709 --> 15:32.883
The plan only works

15:32.917 --> 15:34.505
if nobody knows there is one.

15:36.611 --> 15:39.027
I'll act totally normal.

15:39.061 --> 15:41.616
Then they'd definitely
know something's up.

16:14.376 --> 16:16.619
Are you coming
to poker this week?

16:19.277 --> 16:20.451
What day is it?

16:21.900 --> 16:22.901
Wednesday.

16:24.351 --> 16:25.525
This Wednesday.

16:31.047 --> 16:32.773
I'm afraid I don't think I can.

16:34.844 --> 16:36.363
That's a shame.

16:36.398 --> 16:38.917
Shirley's making her risotto.

16:38.952 --> 16:40.298
Mushroom?

16:40.333 --> 16:41.575
Naturally.

16:44.889 --> 16:46.684
Well, let me see what I can do.

16:50.066 --> 16:52.793
Right. To the matter
at hand.

16:56.107 --> 16:57.177
Phone records.

16:58.316 --> 17:00.594
Calls to and from
Kenny's work phone

17:00.629 --> 17:02.251
the two days before he...

17:02.286 --> 17:03.459
Died.

17:05.634 --> 17:07.739
Was he working for you
around this time?

17:09.189 --> 17:10.190
No.

17:12.296 --> 17:14.056
He'd left the service by then.

17:15.781 --> 17:16.782
It's just...

17:17.853 --> 17:20.648
There were several
incoming and outgoing calls

17:20.683 --> 17:22.202
to a Russian number.

17:24.066 --> 17:27.587
Anyway, I'll leave you
to go over it all.

17:29.761 --> 17:32.212
Give me a shout if
you have any questions.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.766
Thanks, Mike.

17:35.629 --> 17:37.286
I emailed this to your desk

17:37.321 --> 17:38.736
over a week ago,
you know.

17:39.909 --> 17:41.048
Really?

17:41.083 --> 17:42.740
That's why I suggested this

17:42.774 --> 17:44.673
when you asked where they were.

17:45.501 --> 17:47.089
Didn't want them to get lost.

17:49.333 --> 17:50.817
Let me know about Wednesday.

17:52.128 --> 17:55.235
You have to let us win it
back sometime, you know.

18:12.010 --> 18:14.012
Ah! Hello, Carolyn.

18:14.047 --> 18:15.186
Time for P.E.?

18:15.220 --> 18:16.256
Indeed.

18:16.291 --> 18:17.371
Do you think you could manage

18:17.395 --> 18:19.328
to get those
phone records to me?

18:19.363 --> 18:20.916
They're taking a very long time.

18:20.950 --> 18:24.126
Hmm. I, er, had a call
about those just this morning.

18:24.160 --> 18:27.198
Scotland Yard dragging
their feet, as per.

18:27.232 --> 18:28.993
Shouldn't be too much longer.

18:34.792 --> 18:35.793
What?

18:42.178 --> 18:43.248
Are you...

18:47.356 --> 18:49.116
working for them, Paul?

18:51.187 --> 18:52.257
Excuse me?

19:02.164 --> 19:03.165
Are you?

19:07.065 --> 19:08.757
Are you, Carolyn?

19:11.518 --> 19:14.072
Why on Earth
would you ask me that?

19:15.660 --> 19:17.835
Well, the same reason
you asked me.

19:19.906 --> 19:21.770
Because we don't
trust each other.

19:25.532 --> 19:26.706
Should I...

19:29.674 --> 19:30.882
trust you?

19:33.264 --> 19:36.405
Heavens, no.

19:36.440 --> 19:38.131
None of us are to be trusted,

19:38.165 --> 19:40.202
that's why we work here.

19:40.236 --> 19:41.341
Quite.

19:42.756 --> 19:44.482
Well, I'd best be off,

19:44.517 --> 19:46.001
I have an appointment.

19:47.623 --> 19:48.831
Right.

19:49.556 --> 19:50.730
Carolyn.

19:52.352 --> 19:53.388
This is your office.

19:58.945 --> 19:59.946
Oh.

20:01.465 --> 20:03.087
That's very good light.

20:43.161 --> 20:44.715
Was that your boyfriend?

20:44.749 --> 20:46.579
My mum's boyfriend.

20:46.613 --> 20:48.166
Is he a pervert?

20:48.201 --> 20:49.996
No. He's just...

20:50.030 --> 20:54.103
really, really... nice.

20:58.798 --> 21:00.213
You want to bunk off?

21:04.217 --> 21:05.839
Do you think I'm dumb?

21:05.874 --> 21:07.427
I'm not going anywhere with you.

21:07.462 --> 21:09.049
Come on!
It'll be fun.

21:11.051 --> 21:12.812
We can do anything you want.

21:15.539 --> 21:16.712
Anything.

21:39.286 --> 21:41.012
You'll need me
to help you translate.

21:41.046 --> 21:43.497
I remember your languages
were...

21:43.532 --> 21:46.051
Piss off!
I'm fluent in Spanish.

21:47.121 --> 21:50.021
Ooh, Spanish.

21:53.507 --> 21:55.060
I know what you're trying to do.

21:55.095 --> 21:56.510
You're not coming with us.

21:56.545 --> 21:58.478
I bet you
get homesick in a week.

21:58.512 --> 21:59.548
No, I won't.

21:59.582 --> 22:00.825
The heat will be awful.

22:01.722 --> 22:03.828
You'll have to wax all the time.

22:04.794 --> 22:05.761
You're so old.

22:05.795 --> 22:07.694
People don't just wax any more.

22:07.728 --> 22:09.868
I don't want to look
like a 12-year-old girl.

22:11.318 --> 22:12.630
You are a 12-year-old girl.

22:12.664 --> 22:14.459
I'm 14!

22:16.875 --> 22:18.014
Where is your Dad?

22:19.361 --> 22:20.638
London.

22:20.672 --> 22:22.295
So, you're stuck with your mum?

22:22.329 --> 22:23.365
Don't remind me.

22:23.399 --> 22:25.090
Mums are the worst, right?

22:25.125 --> 22:26.230
You know how annoying it is

22:26.264 --> 22:28.128
when you have to be
around two people in love?

22:28.162 --> 22:29.267
Ugh.

22:29.302 --> 22:30.865
Well, imagine one of
those people is your mum.

22:30.889 --> 22:33.720
It's disgusting.
He's disgusting.

22:33.754 --> 22:35.169
If it's that bad,
kill him.

22:35.204 --> 22:37.931
You're a
real role model, you know that?

22:37.965 --> 22:40.313
Oh, my
God! You're really bad.

22:40.347 --> 22:44.765
The humidity in South America
will not be kind to that hair.

22:44.800 --> 22:47.906
Cuba's in
North America, you idiot!

22:47.941 --> 22:49.045
Cuba!

22:50.426 --> 22:52.428
Cuba!

22:53.774 --> 22:55.811
You are totally delusional.

23:18.420 --> 23:20.422
Shall we go for a drive?

23:20.456 --> 23:21.630
Mmm.

23:31.916 --> 23:33.020
This is nice.

23:33.883 --> 23:34.884
Is it?

23:37.301 --> 23:38.302
How are you?

23:39.268 --> 23:40.304
Galvanized.

23:40.338 --> 23:41.650
I can see that.

23:43.617 --> 23:45.205
Are you in a rush?

23:45.239 --> 23:47.621
Not rushed,
just impatient.

23:49.554 --> 23:51.901
Are we going
somewhere in particular?

23:52.143 --> 23:53.178
Yes.

23:54.387 --> 23:56.112
Are you going to tell me where?

23:57.286 --> 23:58.287
No.

24:05.467 --> 24:06.502
What are you doing?

24:06.537 --> 24:08.090
Give me your wallet. Why?

24:08.124 --> 24:09.540
Just give me your wallet.

24:13.233 --> 24:15.233
What the hell are you doing?

24:16.409 --> 24:18.238
What did you want with my child?

24:19.550 --> 24:21.414
I'm going to
ask you again, Konstantin,

24:21.448 --> 24:22.908
and you're going
to answer me correctly.

24:22.932 --> 24:24.831
What did you want with my child?

24:24.865 --> 24:27.074
I swear, I try nothing.

24:27.109 --> 24:28.352
She kissed me.

24:29.353 --> 24:30.975
Geri kissed you.

24:37.706 --> 24:39.604
You don't have to do this.

24:39.639 --> 24:41.537
I already know you are scary.

24:41.572 --> 24:43.919
Why did Kenny call you
the night before he died?

24:44.506 --> 24:45.748
Konstantin?

24:46.266 --> 24:47.301
Konstantin?

24:47.336 --> 24:50.477
Okay, okay.
He called me.

24:50.512 --> 24:52.065
What did you get him into?

24:52.099 --> 24:53.100
Nothing.

24:54.447 --> 24:55.793
If you don't tell me...

24:55.827 --> 24:57.547
I don't know what
this is, or what you're...

25:04.388 --> 25:05.458
Tell me.

25:05.492 --> 25:07.218
He ask if I was his father.

25:09.462 --> 25:10.635
Hey.

25:14.363 --> 25:15.399
What did you tell him?

25:16.330 --> 25:17.884
I told...

25:17.918 --> 25:19.851
I told him I didn't know.

25:52.711 --> 25:53.712
Get out.

26:30.719 --> 26:31.892
You're cooking.

26:35.188 --> 26:37.362
I thought we were
having veg stew tonight.

26:38.156 --> 26:41.470
I really just felt
like a pork pie,

26:41.505 --> 26:42.747
if I'm honest.

26:42.782 --> 26:44.956
I went shopping specifically.

26:50.187 --> 26:51.223
They're wonky.

26:51.480 --> 26:53.033
The ones that no one wanted.

26:55.338 --> 26:57.651
Geri, are you comparing
yourself to a carrot?

27:01.785 --> 27:04.547
I know you don't
like me very much... Geri.

27:04.581 --> 27:06.721
And now you have to
put up with me because

27:06.756 --> 27:08.723
you and I are all that's left

27:08.758 --> 27:10.829
of this family, and...

27:10.863 --> 27:13.003
I don't love being here either,

27:13.038 --> 27:15.385
having you treat me
like I'm some kind of

27:15.420 --> 27:16.697
idiotic annoyance

27:16.731 --> 27:19.665
whose intellectual power
could never match up to yours.

27:19.700 --> 27:21.115
Could we do this after we've...

27:21.149 --> 27:23.566
But I choose to stay because...

27:24.601 --> 27:26.154
Because you're all I have, too.

27:26.189 --> 27:28.329
And I thought that
maybe we'd learn to...

27:29.330 --> 27:30.814
I don't know,

27:30.849 --> 27:33.748
do more than just
tolerate each other.

27:33.783 --> 27:35.301
It would be so much better

27:35.336 --> 27:37.787
if we could have this
conversation after I've eaten.

27:41.204 --> 27:42.274
All right.

27:44.276 --> 27:45.795
All right.

27:53.319 --> 27:54.597
You were your father's.

27:59.671 --> 28:00.982
And Kenny was mine.

28:03.778 --> 28:07.368
And that is how things
were when we were all alive.

28:09.370 --> 28:11.199
He understood you and you him,

28:11.234 --> 28:12.718
in a way I never did.

28:12.753 --> 28:14.962
And I understood Kenny
and he me,

28:14.996 --> 28:16.342
in a way your father never did.

28:16.377 --> 28:19.691
So... No.

28:20.864 --> 28:22.832
You're not easy
for me to understand.

28:24.834 --> 28:27.043
And I know I'm
not supposed to say that.

28:28.458 --> 28:29.458
But it's the truth.

28:30.564 --> 28:32.773
There's no more
can be said about it.

28:35.258 --> 28:37.571
Now, I can pretend

28:37.605 --> 28:39.676
to enjoy wonky carrot stew

28:39.711 --> 28:42.230
and listen to gong bells

28:42.265 --> 28:44.036
and all the other inane
things that interest you,

28:44.060 --> 28:46.683
but I don't,
because I can't lie,

28:46.718 --> 28:47.995
do you see?

28:48.616 --> 28:49.652
I know other parents do,

28:49.686 --> 28:50.732
they tell their children they're

28:50.756 --> 28:52.586
wonderful at this
and great at that,

28:52.620 --> 28:53.794
but I just...

28:54.864 --> 28:56.866
I don't have that gene.

28:57.224 --> 28:58.709
So...

29:00.076 --> 29:03.217
To you,
I am harsh and cold,

29:03.251 --> 29:07.601
and to me you are
disappointed and expected.

29:08.596 --> 29:09.770
Oh!

29:14.822 --> 29:15.892
Ooh.

29:27.891 --> 29:29.376
But you're right,
Geraldine.

29:31.067 --> 29:32.758
All we've got left
is each other.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.574
So, you make your stew and
I'll try and pretend to enjoy it.

29:39.455 --> 29:41.180
And while I do,

29:41.215 --> 29:42.699
you can tell me exactly

29:42.734 --> 29:45.599
what's been going on
between you and Konstantin.

29:45.633 --> 29:47.290
Where you've been,
what you've done,

29:47.324 --> 29:49.430
and why he came to visit you.

29:49.465 --> 29:53.400
Because it seems while
I've been unable to lie to you,

29:53.434 --> 29:56.437
you've had no problem

29:56.472 --> 29:57.749
lying to me.

30:07.828 --> 30:09.346
Call me when it's done.

30:28.311 --> 30:30.692
Where've you been?

30:31.589 --> 30:34.398
Will people
stop waiting for me in the dark!

30:34.597 --> 30:37.462
Bit late for an evening stroll.

30:39.074 --> 30:41.431
I was
trying to get my step-count up.

30:41.466 --> 30:45.435
Hmm. You know, it turns out
Kruger wasn't the man we were after.

30:45.470 --> 30:48.093
No?
No.

30:48.127 --> 30:51.061
It was someone else who
was dipping into the honey pot.

30:53.547 --> 30:55.203
Then why make me stay here?

30:55.238 --> 30:57.205
His wife, Bertha,

30:57.240 --> 30:58.862
she's our focus now.

31:00.450 --> 31:02.625
Because she was
stealing the funds?

31:02.659 --> 31:05.041
No, because she's dead.

31:05.075 --> 31:07.388
Whoever ordered that hit
is who we want.

31:08.838 --> 31:11.254
Do you have any idea
who'd want that woman dead?

31:11.959 --> 31:13.271
Why would I?

31:14.533 --> 31:16.397
Does this mean
I can leave London?

31:18.143 --> 31:21.215
It means the
job description's changed.

31:22.127 --> 31:23.818
Find out who gave that order,

31:23.853 --> 31:25.164
whatever it takes.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.444
If there's a breach,
we're both to blame,

31:28.478 --> 31:29.721
but believe me,

31:30.722 --> 31:32.655
you will be the one who'll fall.

32:01.605 --> 32:02.986
Up for a game?

32:08.163 --> 32:09.164
You're up.

32:23.903 --> 32:24.904
Total fluke.

32:36.537 --> 32:37.607
So why you here?

32:37.641 --> 32:40.265
You want to ask
about my gold medals?

32:40.299 --> 32:42.025
Oh, I thought it was bronze.

32:42.059 --> 32:43.095
Do you know who I am?

32:43.129 --> 32:45.511
I know you're working
for The Twelve.

32:45.546 --> 32:47.168
I know you're working with her.

32:47.829 --> 32:48.830
Your turn.

32:57.105 --> 32:58.140
You bowl a lot?

32:58.175 --> 32:59.624
Never.

32:59.659 --> 33:02.420
I noticed the way Villanelle
copied your first kill.

33:03.318 --> 33:04.664
Very original.

33:05.832 --> 33:07.282
She must really admire you.

33:10.068 --> 33:11.724
Though, whoever
tried to imitate her

33:11.759 --> 33:13.381
did a really poor job.

33:13.416 --> 33:14.796
My husband's still alive.

33:16.522 --> 33:19.215
You don't talk to people
when they are bowling.

33:20.388 --> 33:21.734
That was a strike.

33:21.769 --> 33:23.219
Did they send her to kill Kenny?

33:23.253 --> 33:24.289
My God,

33:24.323 --> 33:26.222
is this what
she has to deal with?

33:26.256 --> 33:27.533
Where is she?

33:27.568 --> 33:29.328
Just because you
don't want it to be her,

33:29.363 --> 33:30.571
doesn't mean it wasn't.

33:30.605 --> 33:31.468
It wasn't.

33:31.503 --> 33:33.988
Do you know she's been promoted?

33:34.023 --> 33:36.059
She will never be loyal to you.

33:36.094 --> 33:37.095
And she's loyal to you?

33:37.129 --> 33:38.510
Aye, she respects me.

33:38.544 --> 33:39.752
Really?

33:39.787 --> 33:41.547
I created her.

33:41.582 --> 33:45.413
I took raw shit and
moulded it into steel.

33:45.448 --> 33:48.692
I broke her back,
I gave her wings.

33:48.727 --> 33:50.798
She's perfect killing machine.

33:51.695 --> 33:53.145
That's all she's there for.

33:53.180 --> 33:54.836
That's all she knows.

33:54.871 --> 33:56.045
I don't think so.

33:56.079 --> 33:59.358
Oh, you think she cares
what you think?

34:01.119 --> 34:03.052
She's moving up in the world.

34:03.086 --> 34:04.812
You'll never touch her now.

34:23.451 --> 34:25.418
You think you are winning.

34:25.453 --> 34:28.248
You will never win at this game.

34:28.284 --> 34:30.458
You can't beat us.
You understand?

34:30.493 --> 34:33.076
I can kill you...

34:33.100 --> 34:34.462
any time.

34:41.697 --> 34:42.699
End of game.

35:38.634 --> 35:40.014
She's off sick today.

35:40.049 --> 35:41.050
Hmm.

35:41.464 --> 35:42.638
Don't worry.

35:42.672 --> 35:44.674
I'm going to make you
look amazing.

36:56.547 --> 36:57.801
Irina,

36:57.826 --> 36:59.690
school's out early this year.

36:59.842 --> 37:01.119
Be ready.

37:17.101 --> 37:18.689
What the hell have you done?

37:18.723 --> 37:20.069
I'm done with this shit.

37:22.555 --> 37:24.177
I'm done with it.
I'm leaving.

37:25.351 --> 37:27.007
What do you mean you're leaving?

37:27.042 --> 37:29.078
Oh, I've got to get out of here.

37:34.498 --> 37:36.396
How was your meeting
with Helene?

37:36.431 --> 37:38.260
That's not her real name.

37:39.606 --> 37:41.194
Look at you.

37:43.092 --> 37:44.508
I'm a Keeper now.

37:46.199 --> 37:47.614
You get to go home.

37:48.960 --> 37:52.239
You think I get to go home
after this disaster?

37:57.003 --> 37:59.661
Here, give it to me,
give it to me.

38:02.491 --> 38:03.527
You can...

38:03.561 --> 38:05.494
You can pinch it
with this, go on.

38:05.529 --> 38:07.047
Yeah, grab it.

38:10.590 --> 38:11.902
Pinch it.

38:23.308 --> 38:25.207
Good.

38:29.822 --> 38:31.720
Come on.

38:53.784 --> 38:55.164
So, what happened?

38:58.630 --> 39:00.804
I don't want
to do this any more.

39:05.143 --> 39:06.144
Come on.

39:08.953 --> 39:10.921
Just clean yourself up,

39:11.027 --> 39:12.788
and I'll order pizza.

39:14.701 --> 39:18.187
Hmm? Okay.
