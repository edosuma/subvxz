You've reached
Michael Stonebridge.

01:15.125 --> 01:16.626
Leave a message.
I'll call you back.

01:25.637 --> 01:29.407
Rosie, how's it going?

01:29.442 --> 01:31.709
It's... Rachel.

01:31.744 --> 01:34.546
It hasn't changed
since we met.

01:34.581 --> 01:38.116
What was it...
two hours ago?

01:38.151 --> 01:39.751
Yeah.

01:39.786 --> 01:42.354
So, anything?

01:42.389 --> 01:44.156
No.

01:44.190 --> 01:46.325
I'm just... Curious

01:46.359 --> 01:48.795
how on earth they
allowed an American to...

01:48.829 --> 01:50.963
To work for the brits?

01:50.998 --> 01:52.665
It's a long story.

01:52.700 --> 01:54.968
But is it
a good story?

01:55.002 --> 01:58.438
No. Just long.

01:58.472 --> 02:02.342
All right,
mystery man.

02:02.377 --> 02:05.679
Let's just say, you get a
second chance, you take it.

02:05.714 --> 02:07.481
I'll bear that
in mind.

02:07.515 --> 02:09.083
Yeah.

02:13.689 --> 02:15.957
And finally.

02:17.393 --> 02:19.528
I'm guessing that's him.

02:21.097 --> 02:23.332
So he's
a big deal, huh?

02:23.366 --> 02:25.701
I doubt it,
except to me.

02:25.735 --> 02:28.203
He's the first asset I've
been given responsibility for

02:28.238 --> 02:30.539
since I came here,
so getting him

02:30.574 --> 02:32.474
quickly and quietly
to the high commission

02:32.508 --> 02:34.509
would make me look good.

02:35.778 --> 02:37.846
You already look
good to me, Rosie.

02:41.317 --> 02:42.717
Nice laugh.

02:50.525 --> 02:52.493
I'm guessing
that's a rental.

03:04.303 --> 03:06.938
Mr. Keemal, this is
Patrick Burton,

03:06.972 --> 03:08.606
deputy head
of mission.

03:08.641 --> 03:10.608
Thank you.

03:10.643 --> 03:13.478
Would you like to
check the laptop?

03:13.512 --> 03:15.346
Well, forgive my cynicism,
miss MacMillan,

03:15.381 --> 03:19.016
but babysitting a
Libyan office clerk

03:19.051 --> 03:21.119
who wants a council house
on the South coast

03:21.153 --> 03:24.723
is hardly a baptism
of fire for you.

03:27.426 --> 03:30.862
Or a glorious
valediction for me.

04:12.972 --> 04:14.573
Bravo,
we have visual on you.

04:14.607 --> 04:15.941
Hey, is that
my guardian angel

04:15.975 --> 04:18.043
looking down on me
from above?

04:18.077 --> 04:20.245
What are you
wearing today?

04:20.279 --> 04:21.913
Concentrate.

04:33.493 --> 04:35.494
Stop, please.

04:48.774 --> 04:50.208
Shit.

05:19.539 --> 05:21.673
Stay there!

05:34.787 --> 05:35.721
He's down.

05:35.755 --> 05:38.056
We need to get Scott
out of there.

05:38.091 --> 05:39.224
Get them out!

05:39.258 --> 05:41.493
Stand back!

05:41.527 --> 05:43.028
They're taking hostages.

05:58.411 --> 06:00.512
Go, go, go, go, go!

06:15.228 --> 06:17.262
Get in!

06:17.296 --> 06:18.263
Who the fuck are you?

06:18.297 --> 06:20.798
I'm from the British
consulate. Get in.

08:07.273 --> 08:09.073
You're dead,
Stonebridge.

08:09.108 --> 08:10.241
You clear
back there?

08:10.276 --> 08:11.309
No.

08:11.343 --> 08:13.444
Then why did you
come in here?

08:13.479 --> 08:14.579
Did you make that
mistake in Helmand?

08:14.613 --> 08:15.580
No.

08:15.648 --> 08:16.915
Then don't do it
here.

08:16.949 --> 08:20.552
I am going to get all
my men through this.

08:20.587 --> 08:22.688
You understand?

08:22.722 --> 08:24.456
That means you,
Jake.

08:46.413 --> 08:47.780
Hey.

08:47.814 --> 08:49.148
Hey.

08:49.182 --> 08:50.983
Take a seat.

08:52.419 --> 08:54.620
Stonebridge... I know him.

08:54.654 --> 08:56.055
Stood with him
in the sandpit.

08:56.089 --> 08:57.689
He'll get you
through this.

08:59.793 --> 09:01.226
Jake, you were born
for the regiment,

09:01.261 --> 09:04.062
like me, like dad.

09:04.097 --> 09:05.497
I know.

09:05.531 --> 09:07.566
That's what I want.

09:07.601 --> 09:09.868
I just...

09:09.903 --> 09:11.837
I don't know.

09:11.871 --> 09:16.575
Maybe we should take
a break, you know.

09:16.610 --> 09:18.678
Come back,
try again.

09:18.712 --> 09:21.347
Listen. You and me,
people like us,

09:21.382 --> 09:23.249
we have to fight
for everything...

09:23.283 --> 09:27.053
every last
fucking thing.

09:27.087 --> 09:28.287
They want you
to doubt yourself.

09:28.322 --> 09:32.492
They want you to give in,
but we won't let them.

09:32.526 --> 09:34.827
We won't let them.

09:37.931 --> 09:39.232
What are we?

09:39.266 --> 09:40.733
Brothers
and soldiers.

09:40.767 --> 09:43.402
We're brothers
and soldiers.

09:45.572 --> 09:47.039
Listen.

09:48.541 --> 09:50.576
I'll... I'll have a word
with him, all right?

09:50.611 --> 09:54.213
Don't worry
about it, all right?

09:55.081 --> 09:57.683
You just stay
focused.

09:57.717 --> 09:59.518
Yeah.

09:59.552 --> 10:01.353
Good lad.

10:14.401 --> 10:15.601
Huh. Craig Hanson.

10:15.635 --> 10:18.137
Hey. There he is.

10:18.172 --> 10:19.172
How are you?

10:19.206 --> 10:20.272
Good. You?

10:20.307 --> 10:21.240
I'm fine, thanks.

10:21.275 --> 10:22.675
Excellent.

10:22.709 --> 10:25.377
Michael Stonebridge,
desk jockey.

10:25.412 --> 10:27.847
Who'd have
believed it?

10:27.881 --> 10:30.849
Man of your talents on the
circuit could be raking it in.

10:30.883 --> 10:32.117
I'm happy here.

10:32.151 --> 10:35.620
Of course. Loyalty was
always your thing.

10:35.655 --> 10:37.155
But the private
sector...

10:37.190 --> 10:38.657
I'm telling you,
that's where it's at.

10:38.691 --> 10:41.126
Is that what
you tell Jake?

10:41.160 --> 10:44.163
I don't tell him
anything.

10:44.197 --> 10:45.697
He's, uh...

10:48.134 --> 10:51.537
He's making
mistakes, Craig.

10:51.572 --> 10:53.072
What, training
exercises?

10:53.107 --> 10:54.941
This is the regiment.

10:54.976 --> 10:56.577
The bar's not being
lowered on my watch.

10:56.611 --> 10:58.279
So don't lower it,
Michael.

10:58.313 --> 10:59.980
Come on. He did
3 tours of Helmand,

11:00.015 --> 11:02.817
went toe to toe with Terry
Taliban every fucking day,

11:02.851 --> 11:04.619
and he's seen Christ knows
how many of his mates

11:04.653 --> 11:07.455
get crated
back home.

11:07.489 --> 11:09.390
He's a rock,

11:09.424 --> 11:11.158
just like you
and me.

11:16.565 --> 11:19.267
Just... just get him
through it, all right?

11:19.301 --> 11:21.202
Whatever it takes.

11:24.407 --> 11:27.309
I had your back
once, Michael.

11:27.343 --> 11:28.410
Basra.

11:28.444 --> 11:30.012
Kandahar.

11:30.046 --> 11:30.946
You remember.

11:30.981 --> 11:32.915
Yeah, of course
I do.

11:34.084 --> 11:36.386
I'll bet you must miss
it, in the field?

11:37.422 --> 11:39.757
Who wouldn't?

11:39.791 --> 11:41.259
Good to see you.

11:55.140 --> 11:56.140
What the hell
am I doing here?

11:56.174 --> 11:57.241
Use your head.

11:57.276 --> 11:58.610
We're not gonna
be able to respond

11:58.644 --> 12:00.345
if you're in a Kenyan police
station for the next 48 hours.

12:00.379 --> 12:03.547
Come on, Sinclair. We can't
let this shit stand.

12:03.582 --> 12:04.582
Do you think I want
a cock-up like this

12:04.616 --> 12:06.584
on section 20's record?

12:06.619 --> 12:09.387
At this moment,
I'm working on it.

12:11.857 --> 12:14.693
Colonel Bennett.
Colonel Hodge.

12:24.336 --> 12:26.971
Come on! Come on!

12:35.646 --> 12:38.048
Hey, hey. Hey!

12:40.185 --> 12:43.520
Abdulabri Keemal,
born Tripoli in 1953.

12:43.555 --> 12:45.956
He's offering information
about Libyan weapons stocks

12:45.990 --> 12:47.591
in return for asylum.

12:47.625 --> 12:49.993
But he's not the reason
that the convoy was hit.

12:50.028 --> 12:52.362
Patrick Burton,
East Africa specialist.

12:52.430 --> 12:55.466
He's been working in the
region for over 30 years.

12:55.500 --> 12:57.067
Today was his last day on the
job before being sent home.

12:58.436 --> 12:59.603
Huh?

12:59.638 --> 13:01.138
What do we know
about the female?

13:01.172 --> 13:02.406
Her name's Rachel.

13:02.440 --> 13:03.540
Who's this?

13:03.575 --> 13:05.075
It's Damien Scott,
sir.

13:05.109 --> 13:08.012
This kidnapping happened
right under your nose?

13:08.046 --> 13:10.380
Unfortunately, yes. You give me the
word, and I'll get those people back.

13:11.716 --> 13:16.620
Rachel MacMillan, junior attache
at the high commission.

13:16.654 --> 13:18.922
She only took up
her post this week.

13:22.794 --> 13:24.061
All 3 are
being held prisoner

13:24.095 --> 13:26.797
in a rebel-held area
of Mogadishu, Somalia.

13:26.832 --> 13:29.801
Now, a ransom has been
demanded for the britons

13:29.835 --> 13:33.304
from this man...
Huseyin Waabri.

13:35.240 --> 13:36.841
He came to
Europe from a refugee camp

13:36.876 --> 13:40.278
when he was 16, drifted around
until he was implicated

13:40.313 --> 13:42.480
in the murder of a
Somali community leader

13:42.515 --> 13:44.082
in northwest London.

13:44.116 --> 13:45.350
Proposal?

13:45.384 --> 13:48.520
An extraction mission is
possible but highly dangerous.

13:48.554 --> 13:50.955
Mr. Scott, are you
ready to go in now?

13:50.989 --> 13:52.990
Yes, I am, sir.

13:53.025 --> 13:54.759
Without backup
it's a suicide mission.

13:54.793 --> 13:58.096
Your priority is recovery
of the British citizens

13:58.130 --> 14:01.332
and all material
relating to the Libyan.

14:01.400 --> 14:05.903
Oh, and, Mr. Scott, you're the
first man we're sending in,

14:05.938 --> 14:09.306
and it goes without saying
you shall also be the last.

14:09.341 --> 14:11.209
Copy that.

14:19.018 --> 14:21.420
I want you to find out everything
you can about the Libyan.

14:21.454 --> 14:25.090
We need to know exactly what
it is they're not telling us.

14:25.125 --> 14:27.460
I think you have
a lot of faith.

14:27.494 --> 14:29.929
One man,
however good?

14:29.964 --> 14:32.966
We can't afford to make
this look much bigger.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.867
If they pull it off.

14:34.901 --> 14:41.173
If they don't, you can bury
section 20 once and for all.

14:41.207 --> 14:44.510
I'm sorry you got caught up
in this, miss MacMillan.

14:44.544 --> 14:45.911
It goes with
the territory.

14:45.945 --> 14:49.314
Huh. Broken people.

14:49.349 --> 14:51.216
Brutalized beyond
our understanding.

14:51.251 --> 14:53.118
Such a tragedy.

14:54.620 --> 14:56.688
You know, the first
time I came to Somalia,

14:56.723 --> 14:57.990
I made a friend.

14:58.024 --> 14:59.858
He knew what was coming
for this country.

14:59.893 --> 15:01.860
He could see the
full horror of it...

15:01.895 --> 15:05.431
poverty, famine,
civil war.

15:06.500 --> 15:11.336
But he said, "however
bad it gets",

15:11.404 --> 15:13.771
"on darkest day...

15:13.806 --> 15:18.142
"Maalin nooga
madoow...

15:18.176 --> 15:23.914
The embers of hope still glow
in our children's hearts."

15:30.422 --> 15:31.989
I should have been there.

15:32.023 --> 15:33.023
I could have
used some help,

15:33.057 --> 15:35.459
but that ain't
your problem.

15:35.494 --> 15:37.595
Would have been fun
to have you there.

15:37.629 --> 15:38.863
There's a big difference
between you and me,

15:38.897 --> 15:40.097
and that's Kerry.

15:40.132 --> 15:41.132
Say hi to her
for me.

15:41.166 --> 15:42.099
Got to go.

15:42.134 --> 15:45.169
Scott, you take
care, mate.

15:48.073 --> 15:50.274
I found you
an apostle,

15:50.308 --> 15:52.710
someone who can
get you in.

15:52.744 --> 15:54.845
We can leave
in an hour.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.480
You mean we got
a whole hour?

16:35.788 --> 16:37.622
Salaamu alaikum.

16:47.399 --> 16:50.667
May your enterprises
continue to flourish,

16:50.702 --> 16:54.971
and I look forward to the day
you join us again in worship.

16:55.005 --> 16:59.642
Everything changes in a man
except the beat of his heart,

16:59.676 --> 17:03.146
and Allah once flourished
in that heartbeat.

17:13.156 --> 17:16.093
You keep paying homage
to Al-Shabaab

17:16.127 --> 17:18.595
and he will one day
destroy you.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.902
You do not understand.

17:34.579 --> 17:37.915
I have requested a fee
for your safe return.

17:37.950 --> 17:39.584
She's my colleague.

17:39.618 --> 17:43.822
I demand her proper
treatment, as islam decrees.

17:43.890 --> 17:45.858
Fradlam hushma.

17:45.892 --> 17:50.130
You are not scared.
That is good.

17:55.170 --> 17:58.839
And what about you,
arab?

17:58.874 --> 18:01.575
What value
do you have?

18:01.610 --> 18:04.511
Who will pay
for your release?

18:04.545 --> 18:07.948
A foreign corpse
always does wonders

18:07.982 --> 18:10.783
for the morale
of my people.

18:10.817 --> 18:12.385
Maxamed!

18:18.658 --> 18:19.925
Kill.

18:20.894 --> 18:21.827
No. You want to be a soldier,

18:21.861 --> 18:23.094
kill him!

18:23.129 --> 18:27.299
For God's sake!
He's just a child.

18:27.333 --> 18:29.201
This is Somalia.

18:30.403 --> 18:32.938
Childhood is short.

18:34.374 --> 18:35.308
Now kill him.

18:35.342 --> 18:36.509
No. Listen to me.
Kill him now!

18:36.543 --> 18:39.379
Listen to me! No, no, no, no!
No, please. Wait!

18:39.413 --> 18:41.347
I have a proposition
for you.

18:41.382 --> 18:44.117
It will be greatly
to your advantage.

18:50.824 --> 18:54.594
Somewhere a little
more private?

18:57.564 --> 18:58.865
Kalay.

19:25.092 --> 19:27.460
He wants to know if
you've been there before.

19:27.494 --> 19:28.861
To Somalia? No.

19:28.896 --> 19:32.231
But I was trained
by some guys who were.

19:32.265 --> 19:35.734
Then you, of all people,
should know what to expect.

19:35.769 --> 19:37.469
I do.

19:37.503 --> 19:38.770
Good.

19:38.805 --> 19:39.771
Come.

19:39.805 --> 19:41.907
Thank you.

19:41.941 --> 19:43.175
Thanks.

19:43.209 --> 19:46.511
Uh, two seconds.

19:46.546 --> 19:48.447
Am I gonna get to
see you again?

19:48.481 --> 19:51.983
Not if you're going into
Mogadishu single-handed.

19:52.018 --> 19:55.487
Don't you know a sympathy
fuck when you've had one?

19:55.521 --> 19:57.355
I do now.

19:58.591 --> 20:00.025
Good luck.

20:11.504 --> 20:15.674
You have boats.
You could intercept.

20:15.709 --> 20:19.579
It's a very special item,
extremely valuable.

20:19.613 --> 20:22.915
I exchange it with you
for my freedom.

20:26.420 --> 20:28.354
And the other
hostages?

20:28.389 --> 20:32.492
I do not interfere
in another man's business.

20:46.008 --> 20:47.442
Major.

20:58.154 --> 21:00.255
Come.

21:00.289 --> 21:02.424
20, I'm here.

21:02.458 --> 21:04.759
I want you to
move into Waabri's sector.

21:04.793 --> 21:06.193
We're gathering intel
on the Libyan.

21:06.228 --> 21:08.996
He may be the key
to locating the hostages.

21:10.065 --> 21:12.799
Waabri's forces
are just up ahead.

21:12.834 --> 21:16.202
Whilst he lives,
African union soldiers

21:16.237 --> 21:19.372
are powerless
to control the area.

21:19.406 --> 21:21.039
What are you getting
out of this?

21:21.074 --> 21:22.875
There is always
business for me here.

21:22.909 --> 21:24.710
Yeah? What
business is that?

21:24.744 --> 21:25.644
I bury
the dead...

21:25.678 --> 21:27.946
shroud them
for their journey home.

21:36.455 --> 21:41.226
You see that is the price
for crossing Waabri.

21:41.260 --> 21:43.261
You got a shroud
for Waabri?

21:45.463 --> 21:46.864
I have a shroud
for everyone.

21:46.898 --> 21:48.465
Good.

21:51.902 --> 21:54.104
His real name is
Tafiq Elgabhri.

21:54.138 --> 21:55.338
Reclusive Gaddafi
insider.

21:55.373 --> 21:56.539
Knows where all
the bodies are buried.

21:56.574 --> 21:59.175
Kenyan secret service
has had him flagged

21:59.210 --> 22:00.944
as being in country
for the last two weeks.

22:00.978 --> 22:02.645
We hacked into their
surveillance records.

22:02.680 --> 22:04.047
This is him
at a shipping office

22:04.081 --> 22:05.815
in mombasa yesterday
morning.

22:05.850 --> 22:09.185
He used forged I.D's to confirm a shipment
heading down to Southern Mozambique

22:09.220 --> 22:11.121
on a boat called
"Morning Star."

22:11.155 --> 22:13.056
Anything else?

22:13.090 --> 22:16.159
"Morning star" was hijacked
by Somali pirates.

22:16.193 --> 22:17.794
Satellite has it heading
towards Mogadishu.

22:17.828 --> 22:19.862
ETA: About now.

22:19.897 --> 22:21.030
I want eyes
on that boat

22:21.065 --> 22:22.832
and anyone that comes
into contact with it.

22:22.867 --> 22:24.567
Sure.

22:41.384 --> 22:43.185
Move it!

22:43.219 --> 22:44.453
Everybody move!

22:44.487 --> 22:46.455
Let's go!

23:06.476 --> 23:10.612
A reminder that tonight you'll
be employing live rounds.

23:10.646 --> 23:12.580
As an elite soldier,
you will be operating

23:12.615 --> 23:14.382
in uncontrolled
environments

23:14.416 --> 23:15.817
where you have
a split second

23:15.851 --> 23:19.187
to distinguish an
innocent from a hostile.

23:30.299 --> 23:32.634
One mistake,
and you have a scar

23:32.668 --> 23:34.936
on your conscience
forever.

23:36.972 --> 23:39.274
Or you're dead.

23:39.308 --> 23:40.408
Questions?

23:40.443 --> 23:42.711
No, sarge!

23:42.745 --> 23:44.412
Then stack up!

24:46.510 --> 24:48.511
Hanson,
what are you doing?

24:52.849 --> 24:55.318
Hanson, get out!

24:59.189 --> 25:01.591
Come on, hanson.

25:21.482 --> 25:24.217
Hanson!

25:24.251 --> 25:26.786
Come back to the front!
Let's go!

25:32.493 --> 25:33.660
That's an order!

25:37.999 --> 25:39.299
One down!

25:39.334 --> 25:41.835
Shit!

25:41.869 --> 25:43.937
Aah!

25:43.971 --> 25:45.939
Aah!

25:45.973 --> 25:47.541
Aah!

25:49.844 --> 25:50.811
Aah!

25:50.845 --> 25:53.280
Aaah!

25:53.314 --> 25:55.015
Fuck!

25:57.418 --> 25:59.652
What the fuck
have you done?!

26:07.562 --> 26:09.130
Aah!

26:14.703 --> 26:17.038
Hanson!

26:17.073 --> 26:18.774
Aah!

26:18.808 --> 26:20.609
Jake!

26:51.239 --> 26:52.706
Hanson!

26:55.176 --> 26:58.211
Hanson! Shit!

26:58.246 --> 27:00.281
Hanson!

27:10.560 --> 27:12.728
Hanson!

27:29.080 --> 27:32.916
Major, I have a cctv
feed from the docks.

27:37.255 --> 27:40.823
Keemal. He's
unloading something.

27:42.993 --> 27:45.561
Do not lose those
vehicles at any cost.

27:47.030 --> 27:48.964
Jake!

27:54.137 --> 27:56.439
They just called
and told me.

27:58.575 --> 28:00.576
Are you ok?

28:00.610 --> 28:05.214
No, I'm not ok. I'm not
ok with any of it.

28:20.129 --> 28:21.930
Scott, we're
tracking Keemal.

28:21.964 --> 28:23.966
He's reentering
Waabri's zone.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.100
Copy that.

28:25.134 --> 28:26.201
We are your eyes.

28:26.236 --> 28:28.670
Follow our directions
to intercept.

29:01.873 --> 29:04.141
Target approaching.

29:17.789 --> 29:19.623
On my mark.

29:23.928 --> 29:25.763
No.

29:39.044 --> 29:40.979
Be careful.

29:41.013 --> 29:43.882
I see Waabri
and the Libyan.

29:43.917 --> 29:46.085
They're making
some kind of trade.

29:54.828 --> 29:58.398
You can name your price.

29:58.432 --> 30:00.367
You keep your word, yes?

30:00.401 --> 30:02.302
When do I get
the buyer's identity?

30:02.336 --> 30:05.104
Now.

30:05.139 --> 30:06.539
Fuck!

30:06.573 --> 30:07.573
Fuck.

30:07.608 --> 30:08.674
Nice shot.

30:12.579 --> 30:13.512
Scott, report.

30:13.546 --> 30:15.747
We got a sniper.

30:44.611 --> 30:46.779
Shit. Fuck me.

30:56.457 --> 30:58.858
Zero. The Libyan
was taken out.

30:58.892 --> 30:59.959
By who?

30:59.993 --> 31:02.962
Don't know, but it was
a fucking good shot.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.570
Shit.

32:06.492 --> 32:07.859
Hey.

32:10.796 --> 32:12.397
Back off!

32:12.431 --> 32:13.998
Back off!

32:14.033 --> 32:15.300
Bravo, they mustn't find
out you're military.

32:15.334 --> 32:16.401
Lose comms.
Lose comms now.

32:16.436 --> 32:19.004
Fucking
shit. Fuck!

32:22.442 --> 32:24.577
Go on.

32:27.414 --> 32:29.649
Ok, ok, ok, ok.

32:29.683 --> 32:30.783
Ok, ok, ok, ok.

32:30.818 --> 32:34.720
Putting it down.
It's down. It's down.

32:34.755 --> 32:35.955
It's down!

32:35.989 --> 32:37.323
Uh!

32:54.841 --> 32:56.743
He's alive.

32:56.777 --> 32:58.311
Major.

33:00.080 --> 33:01.314
Major.

33:04.584 --> 33:06.085
You heard what
the general said.

33:06.119 --> 33:07.887
He's the last man in.

33:07.921 --> 33:09.155
Section 20...

33:09.189 --> 33:10.956
there's nothing else
that we can do.

33:36.882 --> 33:38.183
Hello.

33:59.104 --> 34:01.005
Who sent you?

34:01.039 --> 34:03.107
Good question.

34:03.142 --> 34:05.343
I'm gonna kick
my travel agent's ass.

34:05.378 --> 34:08.179
You try to steal
the case from me?

34:08.214 --> 34:10.549
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

34:10.583 --> 34:13.585
Who sent you?!

34:13.620 --> 34:16.489
I refer you
to my last answer.

34:18.092 --> 34:20.226
Maya.

34:20.261 --> 34:24.597
People say that mogadishu
is a dangerous place.

34:24.630 --> 34:27.065
But it's funny.

34:27.100 --> 34:31.804
It was London where I learned
how to look after myself.

34:31.838 --> 34:34.206
You know Harlesden?

34:34.241 --> 34:35.306
No.

34:35.342 --> 34:39.277
That is a scary
place.

34:40.981 --> 34:45.418
I joined a gym,
was officially

34:45.453 --> 34:47.954
a "promising
lightweight"

34:47.987 --> 34:50.089
before I had
to leave.

34:54.295 --> 34:55.495
When I used to
work the bag,

34:55.530 --> 34:59.232
it was as if the
world shrank away.

34:59.267 --> 35:04.572
Movement, rhythm...

35:04.606 --> 35:07.809
Timing.

35:07.843 --> 35:09.911
A higher state.

35:14.317 --> 35:17.185
You know
Muhammad Ali?

35:17.219 --> 35:18.387
Yeah.

35:18.421 --> 35:22.424
Mmm. Interesting that
your greatest ever boxer

35:22.459 --> 35:24.693
was a convert to islam.

35:26.629 --> 35:28.897
It's his business,
I guess.

35:30.133 --> 35:34.769
Me... I like to keep
my hand in.

35:38.774 --> 35:41.209
Uh!

35:54.323 --> 35:56.191
Uh!

35:58.294 --> 35:59.795
Michael?

36:04.267 --> 36:06.802
I have to go.

36:06.836 --> 36:09.138
You can't
be serious.

36:09.172 --> 36:10.539
There's the coroner's
hearing tomorrow

36:10.573 --> 36:12.575
and the inquiry.

36:12.609 --> 36:16.211
It's Damien.
He's in trouble.

36:16.246 --> 36:19.048
Damien will always
be in trouble.

36:19.082 --> 36:22.518
Just let me do this one thing.
Then I'll be home.

36:22.552 --> 36:24.753
Home? This isn't
our home.

36:24.787 --> 36:26.421
You haven't even unpacked
half your stuff.

36:26.456 --> 36:30.258
There are still boxes
in the nursery.

36:30.292 --> 36:32.961
If there was
a baby in there,

36:32.995 --> 36:35.030
would you
still leave?

36:43.472 --> 36:46.674
Or maybe you're relieved
I had a miscarriage.

36:57.186 --> 36:59.087
Oh, God.

37:00.089 --> 37:01.489
I'm sorry.

37:02.958 --> 37:04.259
I'm sorry.

37:33.724 --> 37:34.958
Jesus Christ.

37:34.992 --> 37:37.193
What the hell
did they do to you?

37:38.262 --> 37:42.332
Rachel.

37:42.367 --> 37:44.802
I remembered
this time.

37:44.836 --> 37:47.371
Water and a cloth,
please!

37:51.209 --> 37:53.944
You should have seen
the other guy.

37:53.979 --> 37:56.614
Not a mark on him.

38:04.956 --> 38:07.224
Was this an attempt
to rescue us?

38:07.258 --> 38:11.995
Yeah. Gave it a shot.

38:12.029 --> 38:14.564
That was bloody
stupid.

38:14.598 --> 38:15.998
Yeah.

38:20.904 --> 38:23.205
Thanks.

38:33.852 --> 38:35.953
Yes, sir.
The second...

38:35.987 --> 38:37.488
Send me in.

38:40.091 --> 38:42.626
Come on, major.
Send me in.

38:42.661 --> 38:43.727
Send me in.

38:43.761 --> 38:45.462
Michael, you're
out of your depth.

38:45.496 --> 38:47.798
Major, you know
as well as I do

38:47.832 --> 38:49.767
we can't leave him
in there.

38:52.804 --> 38:54.104
But I can't let you
go in there alone.

38:54.139 --> 38:58.509
He won't be alone.
I'll go with him.

39:03.748 --> 39:07.385
Ok. Just as long
as you understand.

39:07.419 --> 39:09.787
This is a roll of
the dice, at best.

39:09.821 --> 39:13.358
Succeed or fail...
each one of us is

39:13.392 --> 39:15.960
putting our careers
on the line.

39:23.735 --> 39:25.402
Roger that.

39:37.548 --> 39:42.251
So, uh, your
Libyan friend.

39:43.654 --> 39:45.088
What about him?

39:45.122 --> 39:47.290
He's dead, huh.

39:47.324 --> 39:48.592
He was shot
at long range

39:48.626 --> 39:51.595
just after he handed a case
off to that son of a bitch.

39:51.629 --> 39:55.232
A silver case?
Square?

39:55.266 --> 39:56.800
How did you
know that?

39:56.835 --> 39:58.569
I saw him
carry it in.

40:00.705 --> 40:01.972
Right.

40:04.743 --> 40:06.010
Well, whatever
was in that case

40:06.044 --> 40:08.812
had Waabri
pretty excited.

41:12.512 --> 41:13.679
Sir, in the last
few seconds,

41:13.713 --> 41:15.214
there was a call to the
dead Libyan's mobile.

41:15.248 --> 41:16.582
We have a bead
on the exact location.

41:16.616 --> 41:18.684
It's less than half
a click.

41:26.259 --> 41:27.893
Who is this?

41:27.927 --> 41:30.462
Mr. Waabri,
I'd like to discuss

41:30.496 --> 41:34.399
the case you have
in your possession.

41:34.433 --> 41:37.334
Maybe we can meet
in person.

41:37.369 --> 41:38.903
Why should I
trust you?

41:38.937 --> 41:41.839
You don't have to
trust me.

41:41.873 --> 41:43.640
You just have to
do business with me.

41:43.708 --> 41:44.942
Where?

41:44.976 --> 41:48.512
Cement factory,
east side.

41:50.749 --> 41:54.452
You brought
the Libyan's phone here.

41:54.486 --> 41:59.757
I told you to destroy
every phone.

41:59.791 --> 42:01.225
Now...

42:06.332 --> 42:08.100
I can be found.

42:17.578 --> 42:19.713
We must move.

42:33.195 --> 42:34.562
Move them.

42:41.771 --> 42:43.171
Move.

42:48.778 --> 42:50.545
Move.

42:50.579 --> 42:52.080
Zero,
we're in position.

42:52.114 --> 42:53.014
We have you.

42:53.049 --> 42:55.183
Enter building,
northeast corner.

43:20.475 --> 43:21.541
Zero, we have
visual.

43:21.575 --> 43:23.543
They're on
the move.

43:23.577 --> 43:25.178
We have
one shot at this.

43:25.213 --> 43:27.347
Make it cold and quick.

43:27.382 --> 43:28.850
Is there any other way?

43:39.028 --> 43:41.864
All right.

43:41.898 --> 43:43.532
Move.

43:48.672 --> 43:51.241
It's the thieves'
treasure hideout.

43:51.275 --> 43:55.345
Soon the 40 thieves
return from within the...

44:01.453 --> 44:04.689
Leaving nothing to reveal
the hidden...

44:42.625 --> 44:44.392
You took your time.

44:44.426 --> 44:46.294
I've definitely saved you more
times than you've saved me.

44:46.329 --> 44:47.295
Bullshit.

44:47.330 --> 44:49.163
Hold still.

44:49.198 --> 44:51.432
I was way ahead
of you.

44:51.467 --> 44:52.367
Looked like it.

44:52.401 --> 44:53.601
You shouldn't
be here, Michael.

44:53.636 --> 44:54.636
Yeah, I know.

44:54.670 --> 44:55.637
Boys.

44:55.705 --> 44:57.406
Kalay, kalay.

44:57.440 --> 44:58.774
Hey! Put the gun
down.

44:58.808 --> 45:00.309
No, no, no.
We should help them!

45:00.343 --> 45:01.677
Here's your gun.

45:01.711 --> 45:03.312
Where
the hell is Rachel?

45:06.282 --> 45:07.449
Come on. Let's move.

45:07.483 --> 45:09.017
Where's Rachel?

45:28.171 --> 45:29.805
Shit.

45:43.285 --> 45:45.620
Stay close,
boys. Go, go, go.

45:48.523 --> 45:50.424
Clear.

45:51.326 --> 45:53.093
Come out here now!

45:55.197 --> 45:58.032
Hey, friendly, friendly,
friendly, friendly, friendly.

45:58.066 --> 45:59.200
Rachel?

45:59.234 --> 46:01.402
- Rachel.
- Contact!

46:03.138 --> 46:04.105
Get back!

46:04.139 --> 46:05.106
Rachel!

46:05.140 --> 46:06.507
No chance that way.

46:06.542 --> 46:09.410
This is our best shot.
Trust me.

46:11.380 --> 46:13.548
You want to
give it a shot?

46:13.582 --> 46:15.049
Yeah. Let's move.

46:16.017 --> 46:17.585
Let's go!

46:18.787 --> 46:21.288
Stay close, boys.
Come on. Come on.

46:28.996 --> 46:31.164
You listen
for my signal.

46:42.608 --> 46:43.709
Where'd he go?

46:43.743 --> 46:45.544
I got an alleyway
on my right, potential exit.

46:45.578 --> 46:48.680
I've got open ground,
armed hostiles.

46:49.582 --> 46:51.316
- Go?
- Go.

46:51.351 --> 46:52.718
Cover me!

47:32.560 --> 47:34.295
Cover me!

47:41.270 --> 47:43.338
Go, go!

47:45.140 --> 47:46.707
Go!

47:46.775 --> 47:48.976
Michael, pull back!

47:50.778 --> 47:52.479
Come on!

47:52.513 --> 47:53.480
Scott!

47:53.547 --> 47:55.181
Coming!

48:00.286 --> 48:01.853
You must clear Waabri's
sector and get to

48:01.888 --> 48:03.355
an African union
controlled area.

48:03.389 --> 48:07.192
This sector extends
to over a square mile.

48:07.226 --> 48:09.060
She's not the sodding
junior attache, is she?

48:09.095 --> 48:10.128
In there.
Against the wall.

48:10.163 --> 48:11.329
Here, here, here.

48:11.364 --> 48:12.631
Come.

48:15.501 --> 48:17.336
So who the fuck
are you, Rachel?

48:17.370 --> 48:18.871
My name is
Rachel...

48:18.905 --> 48:20.973
Rachel Dalton.

48:21.007 --> 48:23.175
Military
intelligence.

48:23.209 --> 48:25.144
That explains why
you're such a good liar.

48:25.178 --> 48:27.513
And you are Scott,
kicked out of delta

48:27.548 --> 48:29.649
and for some reason picked off
the scrap heap by Eleanor Grant.

48:29.684 --> 48:30.951
You roll with us,

48:30.985 --> 48:32.686
then no more lies and no more
secret bullshit, all right?

48:32.721 --> 48:34.188
Oh, and you've got
no secrets, Damien?

48:34.222 --> 48:36.490
Is that what you want your
friends here to believe?

48:36.525 --> 48:38.727
What were you doing for
those 8 years after Iraq?

48:38.761 --> 48:40.228
Zero, we could
do with a way out here.

48:40.263 --> 48:41.930
We've got a satellite
feed of the adjacent street,

48:41.964 --> 48:43.565
but it's crawling
with hostiles.

48:43.599 --> 48:45.867
Do what you can to navigate them out.
You must keep moving.

48:45.901 --> 48:47.535
We got to move.
Let's go.

48:47.603 --> 48:48.670
With me.

48:48.704 --> 48:50.238
We're doing
everything we can...

48:50.272 --> 48:53.575
But for now...
You're on your own.

49:24.339 --> 49:26.974
It was you who
killed the Libyan?

49:27.009 --> 49:29.277
He reneged on an
agreement to furnish me

49:29.311 --> 49:33.348
with the items you have.
However...

49:33.383 --> 49:36.118
I accept you received
them in good faith.

49:36.152 --> 49:39.155
As such, I am prepared to
offer you an appropriate sum

49:39.190 --> 49:42.225
to obtain the case.

49:42.260 --> 49:44.461
Why should I...

49:44.495 --> 49:47.131
Believe you?

49:47.165 --> 49:50.401
Mr. Waabri, this is
the young lady...

49:50.436 --> 49:52.537
Who took the shot
you witnessed.

49:52.571 --> 49:54.138
1/2 millimeter
adjustment

49:54.173 --> 49:56.741
of her rifle scope,
and right now

49:56.775 --> 50:00.679
it would be your brains being
eaten off the floor by rats.

50:04.016 --> 50:06.684
The Libyan had it
coming.

50:09.688 --> 50:12.423
But I will play fair
with you...

50:15.027 --> 50:19.430
Until you give me
reason not to.

50:19.464 --> 50:23.367
A generous sum
by any standards.

50:32.411 --> 50:34.445
It's clean.

50:34.480 --> 50:36.147
I'll contact you on it.

50:36.181 --> 50:38.783
You'll have made
your decision by then.

50:50.496 --> 50:51.596
How many hours
of darkness left?

50:51.630 --> 50:52.797
6, sir.

50:52.831 --> 50:55.399
We have to get them
out of there by first light.

50:58.003 --> 51:01.573
Stop.
Wait. Wait.

51:01.608 --> 51:02.908
Go with them. Go. Go.

51:02.942 --> 51:04.709
Go.

51:19.424 --> 51:20.891
Go.

51:22.993 --> 51:25.495
Behind me. Here.

51:25.529 --> 51:28.198
Scott, have we
I.D'd our mystery guest?

51:28.232 --> 51:30.300
Her name is
Rachel Dalton.

51:30.335 --> 51:32.269
Check it.
Sir.

51:32.303 --> 51:34.804
If you want me to shoot
her, just give me the word.

51:34.839 --> 51:37.173
She's kind of a bitch.

51:39.509 --> 51:42.344
Sir, yeah,
she's one of ours.

51:42.379 --> 51:44.280
Get Scott
to put her on.

51:44.314 --> 51:46.749
My boss
wants a word.

51:46.783 --> 51:48.451
Looks like you check
out.

51:48.485 --> 51:49.385
I'm thrilled.

51:49.420 --> 51:51.755
So am I.

51:51.789 --> 51:53.190
This is Rachel Dalton.

51:53.224 --> 51:55.225
Captain, major
Oliver sinclair,

51:55.260 --> 51:56.961
commanding
section 20.

51:56.995 --> 51:58.562
I need you to find me
Waabri's exact whereabouts.

51:58.597 --> 51:59.797
What?
You fucking what?

51:59.831 --> 52:00.831
I want
my men out of there.

52:00.866 --> 52:02.400
And I need
to find Waabri.

52:02.434 --> 52:03.534
Captain, you will
obey the orders

52:03.569 --> 52:04.702
of a direct
superior...

52:04.737 --> 52:06.004
negative. I have
command on the ground.

52:06.038 --> 52:07.205
If you have a problem
with that,

52:07.239 --> 52:10.508
I suggest you contact
general Bennett.

52:10.543 --> 52:11.843
You know
the general?

52:11.877 --> 52:14.011
Well enough to know he would
never have sanctioned

52:14.046 --> 52:15.680
a second
rescue mission,

52:15.714 --> 52:18.182
but I'm sure he would
love to hear about it.

52:18.217 --> 52:20.585
Tell her.

52:20.619 --> 52:23.254
Waabri's current
whereabouts are unknown.

52:23.289 --> 52:26.490
We're monitoring
all comms traffic in his sector.

52:26.525 --> 52:29.793
You know we've dishonored
him by escaping.

52:29.828 --> 52:32.028
He'll want more than
ransom this time.

52:49.980 --> 52:52.915
I heard news of
your prisoners' escape.

52:52.950 --> 52:55.184
Could I offer any
assistance?

52:55.219 --> 52:56.753
That will not
be necessary.

52:56.788 --> 52:59.990
I take solace from the
knowledge that...

53:00.024 --> 53:01.925
The more a believer
deals with devils,

53:01.960 --> 53:05.429
the closer he will come to the
true purpose of his life.

53:05.463 --> 53:08.032
Perhaps, brother, you
have taken possession

53:08.066 --> 53:12.303
of something you know in
your heart belongs to Allah.

53:23.483 --> 53:25.818
Why must you
listen to him?

53:25.852 --> 53:27.786
We can sell
what's in the case.

53:33.093 --> 53:34.793
Now. Now!

54:01.285 --> 54:04.487
Bravo, you have
numerous hostiles inbound.

54:07.091 --> 54:08.325
Get him back.

54:08.359 --> 54:10.127
Here.

54:14.999 --> 54:17.067
Over there.

54:18.970 --> 54:20.837
Back, back,
back, back.

54:34.887 --> 54:37.189
All clear.

54:37.223 --> 54:39.792
There's a price
on our heads now.

54:39.826 --> 54:42.328
I did warn you.

54:43.697 --> 54:47.766
Baxter, this is Scott.
What have you got for me?

54:47.801 --> 54:49.535
The whole
town's after you.

54:49.569 --> 54:51.937
All routes back to the African
union safe zone are shut.

54:51.972 --> 54:54.708
Yeah. No shit,
Einstein.

54:54.742 --> 54:56.142
You got an evac?

54:56.177 --> 54:58.177
We've managed to secure
a chopper in northern Kenya.

54:58.212 --> 55:00.013
It looks like it will be
with you before daybreak.

55:00.047 --> 55:02.515
Sergeant Baxter is sending
over coordinates now

55:02.549 --> 55:03.783
for a rendezvous.

55:03.817 --> 55:06.619
In the meantime, I need you
to fine more secure cover.

55:11.124 --> 55:13.793
- Sinclair...
- Go ahead.

55:13.827 --> 55:15.495
I need you to
contact Langley,

55:15.529 --> 55:18.364
ask for a woman
named Christy Bryant.

55:18.399 --> 55:22.635
Ask her for the location of
the nearest CIA safe house.

55:22.669 --> 55:25.938
If she gives you any bullshit,
tell her it's me that's asking.

55:25.973 --> 55:27.273
Do it.

55:32.713 --> 55:34.481
Mike?

55:43.824 --> 55:46.192
Come on. Go.

56:22.528 --> 56:23.996
Here we go.

56:34.509 --> 56:35.809
Fuck.

56:35.843 --> 56:36.944
This place?

56:36.978 --> 56:37.945
Yeah?

56:37.980 --> 56:39.747
Great a.C.

56:43.386 --> 56:47.722
Betcha she rocks
in the sack.

56:47.756 --> 56:49.157
Why the fuck
are you here, Michael?

56:49.191 --> 56:50.791
You were doing such a good
job on your own, Scott...

56:50.826 --> 56:53.661
shut up.
I was doing fine.

56:53.696 --> 56:55.129
Seriously,

56:55.163 --> 56:57.931
what happens if
we don't make it out?

56:57.966 --> 56:59.999
How would you
sell it to kerry?

57:01.569 --> 57:02.635
I fucking hate it
when you do this.

57:02.670 --> 57:03.636
What's that?

57:03.671 --> 57:04.637
Talk like
a grown-up.

57:04.672 --> 57:06.739
It happens sometimes.

57:42.443 --> 57:43.843
My people were
attacked.

57:43.878 --> 57:45.378
That's unfortunate.

57:45.413 --> 57:47.613
Maybe you should move
to a nicer neighborhood.

57:47.648 --> 57:48.781
You know
nothing about this?

57:48.816 --> 57:51.384
I don't know, Mr. Waabri,
and I don't care.

57:53.153 --> 57:54.253
Do you want to
complete our transaction

57:54.288 --> 57:57.590
and sell me
the case or not?

57:57.625 --> 57:58.725
Where?

57:58.759 --> 58:02.696
Choose a location. Meet
me there in an hour.

58:11.138 --> 58:13.005
We just intercepted
a call to Waabri.

58:13.040 --> 58:15.441
He's arranged a meeting in the next
hour with an unknown American male

58:15.475 --> 58:17.576
to exchange the case.

58:17.611 --> 58:19.711
He's just texted
a set of coordinates.

58:19.746 --> 58:20.912
How far?

58:20.947 --> 58:22.180
One click from
your current location.

58:22.215 --> 58:23.882
Uploading now.

58:25.351 --> 58:28.019
Waabri's arranged a rendezvous
to exchange the case.

58:28.054 --> 58:29.454
We have to go.

58:29.489 --> 58:32.057
You really want to drag two
kids and an old man into this?

58:32.092 --> 58:33.158
What's
in the case?

58:33.193 --> 58:34.293
That's need-to-know.

58:34.327 --> 58:35.661
I got a fucking
need, lady.

58:35.695 --> 58:36.762
That's rich coming
from someone

58:36.796 --> 58:38.497
in Christy Bryant's
little black book.

58:38.532 --> 58:40.199
Fuck you.

58:54.281 --> 58:55.581
Clear.

58:57.384 --> 58:59.552
So, what's
in the case?

59:01.855 --> 59:04.491
I think the case contains
4 neutron initiators.

59:04.525 --> 59:05.492
You think?

59:05.527 --> 59:07.761
Nuclear triggers.

59:08.830 --> 59:10.064
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

59:10.098 --> 59:11.900
Because this is
a classified mission.

59:11.934 --> 59:14.803
You don't get
to ask.

59:14.837 --> 59:16.505
Look, if Waabri is
trying to sell them on,

59:16.539 --> 59:18.707
do you have any idea what
possession of those triggers

59:18.742 --> 59:20.710
could mean
in the wrong hands?

59:27.151 --> 59:28.685
Yeah.

59:30.921 --> 59:32.756
Yeah.

59:34.358 --> 59:36.693
When you get
the money,

59:36.728 --> 59:39.263
we will be free
of this.

59:42.467 --> 59:43.968
A new life
together.

59:44.002 --> 59:46.537
A new life.

59:46.571 --> 59:47.872
Away from here.

59:47.906 --> 59:49.707
Yes.

01:00:01.453 --> 01:00:04.989
Promise to take me
with you.

01:00:11.130 --> 01:00:13.531
All right, Scott, Richmond
can take Burton and the boys

01:00:13.566 --> 01:00:14.766
to the safe house.

01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:16.067
They'll sit tight.

01:00:16.101 --> 01:00:17.168
We can go after
the triggers,

01:00:17.203 --> 01:00:19.771
and everyone will meet
up at the chopper rv.

01:00:19.806 --> 01:00:21.206
I think you're out of
your fucking mind.

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:22.574
Will you babysit
the kids, then?

01:00:22.608 --> 01:00:25.244
I'm not babysitting
the kids.

01:00:25.278 --> 01:00:27.479
Besides that fact, you're too rusty
to do this shit on your own.

01:00:27.513 --> 01:00:28.947
On my worst day...

01:00:28.982 --> 01:00:30.349
in your dreams, buddy.

01:00:30.383 --> 01:00:32.551
For Christ's sake. Cut the
Laurel and Hardy routine.

01:00:32.585 --> 01:00:33.618
Laurel and Hardy?

01:00:33.653 --> 01:00:34.586
You know what
she means by that?

01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:35.620
What?

01:00:35.655 --> 01:00:36.955
She
thinks you're fat.

01:00:36.989 --> 01:00:38.523
Shut up.

01:00:40.292 --> 01:00:43.395
The safe house will give you
cover until it's time for the evac.

01:00:43.429 --> 01:00:44.863
You're in good hands
with sergeant Richmond.

01:00:44.898 --> 01:00:45.998
All right.

01:00:46.032 --> 01:00:47.566
I'll see you
on the other side.

01:00:47.601 --> 01:00:49.068
Ok?

01:00:51.605 --> 01:00:53.205
Go.

01:00:56.977 --> 01:00:58.879
Hold there.

01:00:58.913 --> 01:01:00.147
Gentleman's persuader.

01:01:00.181 --> 01:01:01.215
Ok.

01:01:01.249 --> 01:01:04.685
Big man,
that's for you.

01:01:04.719 --> 01:01:05.853
All right, go.

01:01:05.887 --> 01:01:08.555
Come on, boys. Go, go, go,
quickly. Quickly.

01:01:08.589 --> 01:01:09.556
We good?

01:01:09.590 --> 01:01:10.590
Clear.

01:01:10.624 --> 01:01:12.125
Move out.

01:01:53.434 --> 01:01:54.734
Hello?

01:01:54.769 --> 01:01:57.037
I'm looking for
Michael Stonebridge.

01:01:59.207 --> 01:02:00.708
How far to
the hand-over point?

01:02:00.742 --> 01:02:02.510
Half a click.

01:02:06.048 --> 01:02:08.983
Think she's done
this before?

01:02:09.018 --> 01:02:10.952
Yeah, it looks
like it, buddy.

01:02:13.189 --> 01:02:17.159
If only your recruits could
see you now, Michael.

01:02:17.193 --> 01:02:19.595
What do they say? Those
that can't do, teach?

01:02:21.131 --> 01:02:23.099
Fuck off.

01:02:24.634 --> 01:02:26.669
What's up with you?

01:02:29.672 --> 01:02:31.473
Mike?

01:02:37.479 --> 01:02:39.213
What happened
to your brother...

01:02:39.248 --> 01:02:41.115
his name was Jake.

01:02:43.018 --> 01:02:48.556
It was... The training
can be mentally very...

01:02:50.592 --> 01:02:52.960
He was a fine soldier.

01:02:52.994 --> 01:02:56.097
Of course.

01:02:56.131 --> 01:03:00.568
Losing someone like this
must be... I can't...

01:03:04.038 --> 01:03:07.007
But you know Michael.

01:03:07.041 --> 01:03:10.543
You know that
he's a good man.

01:03:10.578 --> 01:03:12.945
He's very lucky
to have you.

01:03:14.815 --> 01:03:16.682
I had no choice, Scott.

01:03:16.716 --> 01:03:17.850
I had to
take him out.

01:03:17.884 --> 01:03:19.218
So how did you not
see that coming?

01:03:19.252 --> 01:03:22.287
I don't know.
I did, but...

01:03:22.321 --> 01:03:24.556
how did it get
that far?

01:03:26.592 --> 01:03:28.693
Sinclair know about
this?

01:03:29.829 --> 01:03:31.296
Shit.

01:03:45.178 --> 01:03:46.412
Good news.

01:03:46.446 --> 01:03:48.213
The chopper is only
90 minutes away.

01:03:48.248 --> 01:03:49.515
Roger that.

01:03:49.549 --> 01:03:52.218
You call this
a safe house?

01:03:52.253 --> 01:03:53.153
Don't worry.

01:03:53.187 --> 01:03:54.187
We will
get you home.

01:03:54.221 --> 01:03:57.925
You mean britain?

01:03:57.959 --> 01:04:01.128
I sacrificed a marriage and
God knows how many promotions

01:04:01.163 --> 01:04:03.598
so that I could
stay here in Africa.

01:04:03.632 --> 01:04:05.400
Then some prick
in whitehall decides

01:04:05.434 --> 01:04:08.236
that it's too expensive
to keep me on.

01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:09.670
I've got more
in common with these boys

01:04:09.705 --> 01:04:11.872
than I have with
anyone back home.

01:04:13.608 --> 01:04:16.877
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:04:18.680 --> 01:04:19.680
Aah!

01:04:19.714 --> 01:04:20.848
Get down. Get down!

01:04:36.229 --> 01:04:38.197
Zero, we've
been compromised.

01:04:38.231 --> 01:04:39.565
Get out now.
Northwest exit clear.

01:04:39.599 --> 01:04:41.800
Waabri's men
will be here any minute.

01:04:41.834 --> 01:04:44.769
We have to go.
Hey! You, get down!

01:04:44.804 --> 01:04:45.770
Get down on the ground!

01:04:45.805 --> 01:04:47.372
No!

01:04:52.011 --> 01:04:54.011
Friend.

01:04:58.984 --> 01:05:01.619
Old friend.

01:05:01.654 --> 01:05:03.755
"Maalin
nooga madoow."

01:05:03.790 --> 01:05:04.990
"The embers of hope..."

01:05:05.024 --> 01:05:07.526
"...Glow in our
children's hearts."

01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:09.962
You remembered.

01:05:09.996 --> 01:05:11.496
Everything.

01:05:11.531 --> 01:05:13.932
Then it still lives.

01:05:13.966 --> 01:05:15.000
Waabri put guns
in these

01:05:15.034 --> 01:05:16.501
children's
hands, but...

01:05:16.535 --> 01:05:21.973
They decided to
come with us.

01:05:22.007 --> 01:05:23.407
You won't bury
them today.

01:05:23.442 --> 01:05:25.009
Listen.

01:05:25.043 --> 01:05:26.811
I have watched over you,

01:05:26.845 --> 01:05:28.847
but this is the toughest
part of the city.

01:05:28.881 --> 01:05:30.448
Come on.

01:05:32.485 --> 01:05:35.320
God knows how we're
going to get there unseen.

01:05:43.062 --> 01:05:45.030
Zero,
this is bravo one.

01:05:45.065 --> 01:05:46.832
Sir.

01:05:58.679 --> 01:06:00.079
Target
has arrived.

01:06:00.113 --> 01:06:02.448
Set the device
and find your position.

01:06:02.482 --> 01:06:04.283
Right.

01:06:04.317 --> 01:06:06.719
Shut up, sinclair.
I'm working on it.

01:06:29.310 --> 01:06:32.446
Zero, this is
bravo one in position.

01:06:46.361 --> 01:06:48.062
Zero, in position.

01:06:48.096 --> 01:06:49.964
Copy that.

01:07:17.592 --> 01:07:20.361
Here comes
the money man now.

01:07:33.574 --> 01:07:37.143
That's the full
amount in untraceable bonds.

01:07:37.178 --> 01:07:39.646
You're a rich man.

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:49.288
All right.

01:07:49.322 --> 01:07:51.323
You got the guy coming down
the stairs with the case?

01:07:51.357 --> 01:07:53.491
Copy that.

01:08:04.102 --> 01:08:05.536
Go.

01:08:07.472 --> 01:08:09.573
Showtime.

01:08:15.481 --> 01:08:16.680
Oh, shit.

01:08:19.017 --> 01:08:20.785
Fuck!

01:08:39.037 --> 01:08:40.071
Drive!

01:08:40.106 --> 01:08:42.207
Aah! Aah!

01:08:52.184 --> 01:08:54.551
Go!

01:09:00.392 --> 01:09:02.760
Now, Scott.
Now. Hit it now!

01:09:15.642 --> 01:09:18.344
I need a flight check
on that huey.

01:09:25.553 --> 01:09:28.955
Zero?
We're at the rendezvous.

01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:30.023
We still have
the chopper?

01:09:30.057 --> 01:09:31.358
Affirmative, Captain.

01:09:31.392 --> 01:09:33.693
Bird is in the air. Agreed
location in 10 minutes.

01:09:33.728 --> 01:09:35.862
Julia,
exfil in 10.

01:09:41.770 --> 01:09:42.770
Richmond?

01:09:42.804 --> 01:09:43.770
Here.

01:09:43.805 --> 01:09:44.804
Coming in.

01:09:44.839 --> 01:09:48.207
Clear.

01:09:48.242 --> 01:09:50.410
All right.

01:09:50.444 --> 01:09:52.813
Old man...

01:09:52.846 --> 01:09:53.846
Kids...

01:09:53.881 --> 01:09:58.018
Friendly.

01:09:58.052 --> 01:10:00.153
Zero,
in position.

01:10:00.187 --> 01:10:02.322
Kestrel one,
kestrel one, this is zero.

01:10:02.356 --> 01:10:03.957
Are you receiving?

01:10:06.928 --> 01:10:10.030
Kestrel one, come in.
Confirm exfil.

01:10:10.064 --> 01:10:11.965
Repeat. Please
confirm exfil.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.934
Zero,
this is kestrel one.

01:10:13.968 --> 01:10:16.737
We're taking heavy fire.

01:10:16.771 --> 01:10:18.605
Abort! Abort!

01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:21.409
Are you fucking kidding me?
What? Fuck.

01:10:21.443 --> 01:10:23.211
Hold
positions, bravo.

01:10:23.245 --> 01:10:25.579
We need a new
exfil plan.

01:10:25.614 --> 01:10:29.116
I need to speak to
general Olusu immediately.

01:10:30.385 --> 01:10:31.752
Shit. A vehicle. Move.

01:10:31.786 --> 01:10:34.454
Down, down, down, down.

01:10:39.327 --> 01:10:41.694
Sergeant Baxter...

01:10:41.729 --> 01:10:43.563
I want you to listen
to me very carefully.

01:10:43.597 --> 01:10:46.967
African union
forces...

01:10:49.103 --> 01:10:52.572
Sir? Sir, come in.

01:10:52.606 --> 01:10:53.740
Come in.

01:10:53.775 --> 01:10:55.475
Come on, guys. We're
gonna die out here.

01:10:58.346 --> 01:11:01.515
Bravo one,
this is zero.

01:11:01.549 --> 01:11:04.352
The major has an exfil plan,
but it is unsanctioned.

01:11:04.386 --> 01:11:06.320
We cannot broadcast
over comms.

01:11:06.354 --> 01:11:07.989
You have to trust us.

01:11:08.023 --> 01:11:10.625
You need to locate
some transport immediately.

01:11:10.659 --> 01:11:13.828
Maybe...
I can help you.

01:11:23.905 --> 01:11:25.473
Keys.

01:11:28.644 --> 01:11:32.113
Anybody see the entrance to the
freeway, just let me know.

01:11:41.324 --> 01:11:42.391
Keep heading
in this direction.

01:11:42.425 --> 01:11:43.793
I think I've found you
a way out.

01:11:43.827 --> 01:11:44.961
No, no.
Shit!

01:11:44.995 --> 01:11:46.429
- Hold on!
- Fuck!

01:11:53.103 --> 01:11:54.804
Shit.

01:12:00.611 --> 01:12:01.544
Keep your heads down.

01:12:01.579 --> 01:12:02.545
Zero,
come in.

01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:03.713
Go west.
Take the alley.

01:12:03.747 --> 01:12:06.049
Buildings there for cover.

01:12:06.083 --> 01:12:07.517
Case.

01:12:07.551 --> 01:12:08.618
Here's your
triggers.

01:12:08.652 --> 01:12:09.619
Dalton,
Scott, let's move.

01:12:09.653 --> 01:12:11.454
Come on!

01:12:15.592 --> 01:12:16.559
Moving.

01:12:16.593 --> 01:12:17.927
Got it.

01:12:19.429 --> 01:12:21.330
Come on.

01:12:21.364 --> 01:12:23.098
Go.

01:12:28.705 --> 01:12:31.173
Come on.
Come on.

01:12:35.612 --> 01:12:37.347
Go left.

01:12:41.119 --> 01:12:42.553
Switch.

01:12:47.693 --> 01:12:48.893
Coming up.

01:12:48.927 --> 01:12:50.995
Right.
What's the plan?

01:12:51.029 --> 01:12:53.931
Straight ahead.

01:12:53.965 --> 01:12:54.999
Guess I'm
going, huh?

01:12:55.033 --> 01:12:56.734
Move.

01:12:56.768 --> 01:12:58.936
Jesus Christ.

01:13:04.742 --> 01:13:05.775
All right,
come with me.

01:13:05.810 --> 01:13:07.177
Moving.

01:13:21.894 --> 01:13:23.695
Come on, come on,
come on.

01:13:25.898 --> 01:13:27.331
Fuck. We got
company, Michael.

01:13:27.366 --> 01:13:29.066
Yeah, you got company
on your 6 as well.

01:13:29.134 --> 01:13:30.067
Let's go.

01:13:30.102 --> 01:13:31.936
Where are we going?

01:13:31.970 --> 01:13:33.771
Bravo, secure
a defensive position.

01:13:33.805 --> 01:13:35.406
Fuck.

01:13:39.077 --> 01:13:40.911
All right,
move, move.

01:13:42.447 --> 01:13:44.381
Far corner.
Far corner there.

01:13:46.484 --> 01:13:49.086
Far corner. Zero?

01:13:51.155 --> 01:13:53.123
Zero, come in.
We have hostiles approaching.

01:13:53.157 --> 01:13:54.758
We're short on ammo
and we have no way out.

01:13:54.792 --> 01:13:55.725
We'd love to hear
a plan, yeah?

01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:56.793
We've got
your position, bravo.

01:13:56.827 --> 01:13:58.027
We need you to hold.

01:13:58.062 --> 01:14:00.063
We got a lot of hostiles
out here, Michael.

01:14:01.599 --> 01:14:03.433
Baxter, where's
our fucking exfil?!

01:14:03.467 --> 01:14:05.701
Hold positions.

01:14:07.904 --> 01:14:09.805
Finding an exit.

01:14:22.552 --> 01:14:23.519
Ugh.

01:15:02.259 --> 01:15:03.893
Bravo, be aware.

01:15:03.928 --> 01:15:05.695
The hostiles approaching
from your east

01:15:05.730 --> 01:15:06.730
appear heavily armed.

01:15:06.764 --> 01:15:08.665
No shit.

01:15:08.699 --> 01:15:09.834
Michael,
what did you find?

01:15:09.868 --> 01:15:12.837
I found some ammo.
There's no way out.

01:15:12.871 --> 01:15:15.473
We need to hold this position.
We're in a kill zone.

01:15:15.508 --> 01:15:16.474
Down. Get down.

01:15:16.509 --> 01:15:19.144
You got
something for me?

01:15:19.178 --> 01:15:20.479
Ma'am?
Thanks.

01:15:20.513 --> 01:15:21.713
I need one, too.

01:15:21.748 --> 01:15:23.282
Burton.

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:36.729
Shit. Zero,
engaging hostiles!

01:16:06.728 --> 01:16:08.462
Fuck me!

01:16:13.668 --> 01:16:15.936
Zero, whose
is that bird?

01:16:18.172 --> 01:16:19.173
Shit.

01:16:19.207 --> 01:16:20.707
What the fuck?

01:16:20.742 --> 01:16:24.111
Bravo, chopper is not friendly.
This is not an exfil.

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:41.729
Get down!
Down!

01:16:41.763 --> 01:16:44.032
Jesus Christ!

01:16:51.474 --> 01:16:53.108
Whatever they're doing,
they're doing a good job

01:16:53.142 --> 01:16:54.208
of scaring off
the locals.

01:16:54.243 --> 01:16:56.411
Bravo, repeat.
This is not exfil.

01:16:56.445 --> 01:16:59.948
Treat as hostile.
Treat as hostile.

01:16:59.983 --> 01:17:01.750
Yeah!

01:17:09.726 --> 01:17:11.726
Buddy, I need you to
back me up on this!

01:17:11.761 --> 01:17:12.761
What?

01:17:12.795 --> 01:17:14.362
Just follow
my lead.

01:17:17.233 --> 01:17:19.501
You know what I want!

01:17:20.569 --> 01:17:21.536
Give me the case.

01:17:21.570 --> 01:17:22.737
What the fuck
are you doing?

01:17:22.771 --> 01:17:25.306
Give me the fucking
case, lady.

01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:26.841
I will have your
head on a plate!

01:17:26.875 --> 01:17:29.343
That's gonna look
very fucking stupid.

01:17:29.377 --> 01:17:32.112
Stand still and show
me your fucking hands!

01:17:37.652 --> 01:17:40.053
You want this,
you give me him!

01:17:40.087 --> 01:17:41.888
That's a smart move.

01:17:41.922 --> 01:17:46.326
Any chance is better
than none, huh? You!

01:17:50.198 --> 01:17:51.265
Good luck.

01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:52.800
Like you
give a shit.

01:17:52.835 --> 01:17:54.135
You know what?
Come here.

01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:56.337
You'd be surprised.

01:18:00.209 --> 01:18:01.877
Allah has taken
your weapons.

01:18:01.911 --> 01:18:04.579
You came here
for nothing.

01:18:04.614 --> 01:18:06.348
Fuck!

01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:12.854
Shit!

01:18:22.564 --> 01:18:24.264
That plan
went to shit.

01:18:24.299 --> 01:18:25.766
What?

01:18:25.800 --> 01:18:28.502
He took out Waabri. We've got
nothing to bargain with now.

01:18:28.536 --> 01:18:29.536
Everyone make
your shots count,

01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:31.771
and, Burton, you protect
those kids.

01:18:40.915 --> 01:18:42.115
We need your help.

01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:44.017
Jesus.

01:19:31.233 --> 01:19:32.534
Bravo,
be advised.

01:19:32.568 --> 01:19:34.201
The cavalry has arrived.

01:19:34.236 --> 01:19:35.436
Get in!

01:19:45.247 --> 01:19:47.348
Thank you, general Olusu.

01:20:04.165 --> 01:20:05.098
Are you ok?

01:20:05.133 --> 01:20:07.734
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

01:20:31.728 --> 01:20:34.497
General Olusu
sends his regards

01:20:34.531 --> 01:20:39.268
and thanks major sinclair
for his assistance.

01:20:39.302 --> 01:20:42.171
Waabri's men killed
many of our comrades.

01:20:42.205 --> 01:20:44.673
Finally he has
come to justice.

01:21:05.761 --> 01:21:08.163
Sulaimani.

01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:15.737
They will live
a long time

01:21:15.772 --> 01:21:18.307
but it will not be
I who buries them.

01:21:24.481 --> 01:21:27.684
And I'm glad we met
again, my old friend.

01:21:30.254 --> 01:21:33.357
Shall I shroud you for
your journey home?

01:21:38.497 --> 01:21:41.166
I am home.

01:22:09.161 --> 01:22:11.262
The cost of African
history is too often exacted

01:22:11.296 --> 01:22:14.332
in human lives...

01:22:14.366 --> 01:22:16.301
And it's the duty
of people in my position

01:22:16.335 --> 01:22:20.372
to channel the future
towards something brighter.

01:22:22.375 --> 01:22:26.612
I'm well aware of the criticism
that's leveled at me.

01:22:26.646 --> 01:22:29.949
That I'm secretive...

01:22:29.983 --> 01:22:33.586
And reclusive, huh?

01:22:34.621 --> 01:22:35.721
What else?

01:22:35.756 --> 01:22:39.024
Oh, yes. I'm unscrupulous
and ruthless.

01:22:39.059 --> 01:22:43.362
Well, as a businessman,
I take that as a compliment.

01:22:43.397 --> 01:22:46.131
The other thing that I hear
quite a lot of is that

01:22:46.166 --> 01:22:50.903
I will deal with anyone, and in its
work from Algeria to Zimbabwe,

01:22:50.938 --> 01:22:53.973
the Conrad knox foundation
will deal with anyone,

01:22:54.007 --> 01:22:58.244
however unpopular they may be,
in the cause of food aid,

01:22:58.278 --> 01:23:02.448
agricultural development,
the decommissioning of arms.

01:23:02.482 --> 01:23:05.684
I believe the deal can work
where armies and politics

01:23:05.719 --> 01:23:07.920
have failed.

01:23:07.954 --> 01:23:11.858
And the deal started
on this continent... two tribesmen

01:23:11.892 --> 01:23:15.528
at a watering hole
finding a common interest

01:23:15.562 --> 01:23:19.732
and ensuring the very survival
of our species.

01:23:19.766 --> 01:23:25.571
In a world of aggression
and violence, the deal is pure.

01:23:25.605 --> 01:23:29.942
It's the only thing that is
pure, and I truly believe

01:23:29.977 --> 01:23:33.814
that the deal is the only
thing that will save Africa.

01:23:42.957 --> 01:23:45.426
Ladies.

01:23:48.497 --> 01:23:50.698
They know how hot they look in
those uniforms, don't they?

01:23:50.732 --> 01:23:51.665
Huh?

01:23:51.700 --> 01:23:54.568
Of course they do. And that's why
they have women in the military...

01:23:54.603 --> 01:23:56.937
so you can maintain
your permanent hard-on.

01:23:56.972 --> 01:23:58.239
You see, I like
when you do that.

01:23:58.273 --> 01:23:59.307
What's that?

01:23:59.341 --> 01:24:01.643
See things my way.

01:24:03.613 --> 01:24:06.615
Time to face
the music, mate.

01:24:06.649 --> 01:24:09.718
You did nothing
wrong, Mike.

01:24:12.655 --> 01:24:13.956
Yeah.

01:24:15.492 --> 01:24:19.128
It takes some pretty heavy shit
for you to see reason, huh?

01:24:19.162 --> 01:24:20.663
Yeah.

01:24:22.565 --> 01:24:23.732
What about you?

01:24:23.767 --> 01:24:27.068
I'm not going
anywhere.

01:24:27.103 --> 01:24:28.570
20 is all I got.

01:24:28.604 --> 01:24:29.571
Hmm.

01:24:29.605 --> 01:24:30.772
Yeah.

01:24:30.806 --> 01:24:34.809
And the CIA thing you
failed to mention?

01:24:34.843 --> 01:24:37.211
Yeah. I didn't
mention it.

01:24:37.246 --> 01:24:39.914
But I'd appreciate it if you
don't mention it again.

01:24:43.485 --> 01:24:44.786
Damien.

01:24:44.820 --> 01:24:48.289
Michael.
Have fun in school.

01:24:49.558 --> 01:24:51.559
Ladies.

01:24:57.967 --> 01:24:59.801
Thank you.

01:25:12.348 --> 01:25:13.781
You showed some
stones out there.

01:25:13.815 --> 01:25:15.249
Save it.

01:25:16.751 --> 01:25:18.652
You're a ball-Buster,
you know that?

01:25:18.686 --> 01:25:22.689
Yup, and you're an arrogant,
insubordinate prick.

01:25:24.958 --> 01:25:26.159
Here.

01:25:26.193 --> 01:25:28.561
I got you
a souvenir.

01:25:28.596 --> 01:25:30.229
I've got to know
one thing.

01:25:30.264 --> 01:25:31.998
Would you have
let us all die

01:25:32.032 --> 01:25:35.301
for the sake
of these? Huh?

01:25:35.335 --> 01:25:38.338
I wouldn't have lost
any sleep over you.

01:25:38.372 --> 01:25:42.842
I know who Christy Bryant is, and
I know what you did with the CIA.

01:25:42.876 --> 01:25:45.311
Just how well do you
sleep at night?

01:25:45.346 --> 01:25:47.347
Fuck you.

01:26:05.765 --> 01:26:08.367
I want those
triggers.

01:26:17.644 --> 01:26:20.412
You recovered nothing?

01:26:20.447 --> 01:26:22.715
That's what
my report says.

01:26:22.749 --> 01:26:25.517
As you proved on this
mission, secrecy was

01:26:25.552 --> 01:26:28.687
always more important
than success.

01:26:28.722 --> 01:26:29.989
Well,

01:26:30.023 --> 01:26:31.724
I'm waiting.

01:26:31.758 --> 01:26:35.161
I downloaded documents
from the Libyan's laptop...

01:26:35.195 --> 01:26:38.498
dodgy export licenses, money
trails leading back to known

01:26:38.532 --> 01:26:41.534
human rights violators,

01:26:41.568 --> 01:26:46.339
nuclear hardware components
originating from British factories.

01:26:46.373 --> 01:26:48.708
I wouldn't want to
find my name on that.

01:26:48.743 --> 01:26:51.344
This was never
about hostages.

01:26:51.378 --> 01:26:54.514
Now I am happy to
give them to you if you give

01:26:54.548 --> 01:26:57.751
section 20 a clean bill of
health because anyone seriously

01:26:57.785 --> 01:27:00.387
contemplating shutting down
a unit of soldiers

01:27:00.421 --> 01:27:03.423
this dedicated and this
committed is a fucking...

01:27:03.458 --> 01:27:04.758
Captain, you are
way out of li...

01:27:04.792 --> 01:27:05.793
enough.

01:27:05.827 --> 01:27:09.330
Quite a testimonial
for section 20.

01:27:09.364 --> 01:27:12.933
Yes. Well, don't let
them know I said it.

01:27:12.968 --> 01:27:14.902
What about you?

01:27:14.936 --> 01:27:17.905
Whoever has
those triggers...

01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:21.743
I'm fairly sure they won't be
using them as paperweights.

01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:37.293
Have you what
was promised me?

01:27:44.834 --> 01:27:46.969
I was bringing it
to you.

01:27:47.003 --> 01:27:49.372
Of course.

01:27:49.406 --> 01:27:51.574
I have use for them.

01:28:07.458 --> 01:28:10.827
You may try to cheat
the white devils...

01:28:10.861 --> 01:28:14.531
But you cannot
cheat Allah.

01:28:14.565 --> 01:28:17.000
Beautiful.

01:28:21.105 --> 01:28:24.641
Oh! Oh! Oh!

01:28:33.252 --> 01:28:35.353
I want to
offer my thanks

01:28:35.388 --> 01:28:36.955
for all your hard work

01:28:36.990 --> 01:28:40.426
and dedication during
this difficult period.

01:28:40.460 --> 01:28:43.596
These are trying times
for a section like ours,

01:28:43.631 --> 01:28:46.299
and the discipline of each
and every one of you

01:28:46.334 --> 01:28:49.503
both in the field
and in command

01:28:49.537 --> 01:28:53.707
has been as I would
expect... exemplary.

01:28:53.742 --> 01:28:54.875
Baxter?

01:28:54.909 --> 01:28:56.510
This
hasn't gone unnoticed...

01:28:56.544 --> 01:28:57.844
Nice work.

01:28:57.879 --> 01:29:01.148
And as we will be engaging
in more operational work,

01:29:01.182 --> 01:29:07.389
command have decided
as of today that, uh,

01:29:07.423 --> 01:29:08.523
that section 20

01:29:08.557 --> 01:29:11.193
requires new leadership
following the death

01:29:11.227 --> 01:29:14.296
of colonel grant.

01:29:14.331 --> 01:29:18.701
Some of you already know
Captain Dalton... I'm sorry.

01:29:18.735 --> 01:29:19.869
Major Dalton.

01:29:19.904 --> 01:29:21.371
Good morning, everyone.

01:29:21.406 --> 01:29:23.373
You're shitting me.

01:29:26.711 --> 01:29:29.613
I was talking
about you the other day.

01:29:29.647 --> 01:29:30.680
Really?

01:29:30.715 --> 01:29:34.284
Yeah.

01:29:34.318 --> 01:29:37.788
And it made me
realize that...

01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:43.828
can we start again?

01:29:48.367 --> 01:29:51.169
Kerry, of course
we can.

01:29:59.979 --> 01:30:01.846
I love you.

01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:16.428
Ah, I don't know
about you,

01:30:16.463 --> 01:30:18.197
but I would love
an ice cream.

01:30:18.231 --> 01:30:20.600
