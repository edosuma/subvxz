WEBVTT

00:06.590 --> 00:07.260
- Previously, on "Happy!"...

00:08.660 --> 00:09.830
- Why don't you tell me
where we're going?

00:09.860 --> 00:10.830
- How the heck should I know?

00:10.860 --> 00:12.500
You're the detective.

00:12.530 --> 00:13.700
- What about the guy?
Tell me about the guy.

00:13.730 --> 00:15.170
Can you describe him?

00:15.200 --> 00:16.500
You're gonna tell me
what he looks like,

00:16.530 --> 00:17.670
I'm gonna tell him,
he's gonna draw it.

00:17.700 --> 00:18.800
- You owe me.

00:18.840 --> 00:20.540
- I don't owe you
anything at all.

00:20.570 --> 00:22.070
- The only man you ever
loved broke up his marriage.

00:22.110 --> 00:23.410
- I get it.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.340
- Father gunned down
in the line of duty.

00:25.380 --> 00:27.440
Your mother loses her mind.

00:27.480 --> 00:29.450
- I bring you Sax,
and we're even.

00:29.480 --> 00:32.280
These came from the parents
of the other missing children.

00:32.320 --> 00:33.550
Any cop worth his shit

00:33.580 --> 00:35.290
might go out there,
stake him out.

00:35.320 --> 00:36.520
- See if they get a card.

00:36.550 --> 00:38.160
- You gotta talk
to Mrs. Claws.

00:38.190 --> 00:39.690
- Reminds me of
a fella we all knew.

00:39.720 --> 00:42.330
Worked at Gimbels
before it closed down,

00:42.360 --> 00:43.630
ended up hanging himself.

00:43.660 --> 00:45.700
- My monster is very much
alive and kicking.

00:45.730 --> 00:49.670
- Not him, his son.

00:52.600 --> 00:55.440
- You look just
like your picture.

00:57.370 --> 00:58.610
- Nick, are you all right?

00:58.640 --> 01:00.480
Oh no.

01:00.510 --> 01:02.350
- I can see you.

01:07.250 --> 01:11.260
No, no, please.

01:11.290 --> 01:13.890
You.

01:18.660 --> 01:20.700
- But you--
you can't touch me

01:20.730 --> 01:22.230
unless you believe in me.

01:29.370 --> 01:31.310
Bye bye.

01:31.340 --> 01:34.380
Oh, God, no, no.

01:36.180 --> 01:38.920
- No...Happy.

01:40.000 --> 01:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:29.930 --> 02:32.400
- Gotta go after him.

02:32.440 --> 02:34.700
- Nick, are you okay?

02:39.010 --> 02:40.810
- That guy would've
fed my ass to me

02:40.840 --> 02:42.250
if it hadn't been for you.

02:42.280 --> 02:44.850
You saved me.

02:44.880 --> 02:46.420
- That's what partners do.

02:46.450 --> 02:48.290
- You need to calm down.

02:50.390 --> 02:52.890
- We gotta get outta here,
Nick.

02:56.660 --> 02:59.530
- What is it?

02:59.560 --> 03:06.400
- "The best way to a man
is through his stomach."

03:06.440 --> 03:09.410
- "Auspicious Dumpling
Fortune Cookie Company?"

03:12.510 --> 03:15.280
- My ex-husband drove
me out of Manhattan--

03:15.310 --> 03:16.650
literally, in his car.

03:16.680 --> 03:20.550
But now,
I'm a Sussex County siren.

03:20.580 --> 03:22.990
- They may have stripped me
of my pageant title,

03:23.020 --> 03:25.790
but they can't take away
my Jersey Pride.

03:25.820 --> 03:28.430
- They thought white collar
prison would break me,

03:28.460 --> 03:30.760
but it only made me stronger.

03:30.790 --> 03:32.760
- I used to worry about
sleeping with the fishes,

03:32.800 --> 03:35.970
and now I'm fighting
with these bitches.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.700
- Poor Isabella.

03:37.730 --> 03:41.000
Losing a child is the worst
tragedy a mother can endure.

03:41.040 --> 03:43.610
But losing four at once?

03:43.640 --> 03:45.880
I wouldn't wish that
on my worst enemy,

03:45.910 --> 03:48.410
which ironically is Isabella.

03:48.450 --> 03:51.950
- Of course
I feel sorry for Isabella.

03:51.980 --> 03:53.450
I am not heartless.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.450
But this does not mean
I forgive her

03:55.490 --> 03:58.890
for that shit she pulled
at Eddie's wedding.

04:00.560 --> 04:01.830
- Isabella will be okay.

04:01.860 --> 04:04.030
Death is a big part
of being Italian--

04:04.060 --> 04:06.730
death and good sauce.

04:15.970 --> 04:17.810
- You did this to my boys.

04:17.839 --> 04:20.510
- How could you even
suggest such a thing?

04:20.540 --> 04:21.680
- You're they're uncle;

04:21.709 --> 04:22.950
you're supposed
to protect them,

04:22.980 --> 04:24.410
steer them away from this life.

04:24.450 --> 04:26.320
- They were grown men,
Isabella.

04:26.350 --> 04:27.720
- They were babies!

04:27.750 --> 04:29.620
- They were grown up enough
to make their own choices,

04:29.650 --> 04:33.760
and grown up enough
to find a hit man's bullet.

04:37.960 --> 04:40.760
Why don't you
turn off those cameras?

04:40.800 --> 04:42.000
- The cameras stay.

04:42.030 --> 04:45.640
- Your boys are lying in there
with their toes curling up,

04:45.670 --> 04:48.670
and you let in these
flesh-eating vultures.

04:48.710 --> 04:53.010
- I am not ashamed
to show people who I am.

04:53.040 --> 04:54.640
You're cruel, Blue.

04:54.680 --> 04:57.810
You were a cruel boy
and you're a cruel man.

04:57.850 --> 05:01.020
The blonde wife, the house,
the fucking sweaters--

05:02.490 --> 05:03.790
No f-bombs, please.

05:03.820 --> 05:07.460
You wanna lose those fingers?

05:07.490 --> 05:10.790
- None of it changes
what you really are.

05:14.500 --> 05:16.370
- All right, moving inside.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.740
Ten minutes.

05:18.770 --> 05:22.140
Nice work.

05:31.780 --> 05:33.650
- I'm warning you,
Ms. Scaramucci,

05:33.680 --> 05:37.490
this isn't for
the faint of heart.

05:37.520 --> 05:39.160
- I'm ready.

06:03.180 --> 06:04.750
Show me.

06:07.680 --> 06:08.490
Mikey...

06:08.520 --> 06:11.820
My baby...

06:16.030 --> 06:18.760
No!

06:22.870 --> 06:25.170
- And we got it.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.840
No.

06:26.870 --> 06:29.440
- Isabella, I need to get you
outside driving up again.

06:29.470 --> 06:31.610
- Everybody out now!

06:36.580 --> 06:38.780
Especially you.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.900
- I shouldn't have gone
to the mall that day.

06:53.930 --> 06:54.930
It was so crowded,

06:54.960 --> 06:59.800
but I promised Cal
an autograph from a Wishee.

06:59.840 --> 07:03.540
- He knew every word
to Sonny's Wish-mas Special.

07:03.570 --> 07:05.580
- Um...

07:05.610 --> 07:09.110
This-this song was playing
when I lost him.

07:09.150 --> 07:11.820
It's strange.

07:11.850 --> 07:14.080
All these things
get burned in your memory.

07:14.120 --> 07:18.150
This song is in my head now,
playing on a loop.

07:43.610 --> 07:44.980
- We're leaving.

07:47.750 --> 07:49.750
- What the hell?
- I'm sorry.

07:49.790 --> 07:52.090
With all sympathy to everything
you're going through,

07:52.120 --> 07:54.690
I can't be out here all night
playing TV detective.

07:54.720 --> 07:57.030
Those are sob stories,
not leads.

07:58.330 --> 08:00.030
- What about the red cards?

08:00.060 --> 08:01.160
- Maybe.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.630
Maybe.

08:02.670 --> 08:04.030
But we can't pretend
to know this guy's MO.

08:04.070 --> 08:06.640
- Cal was taken
from a Sonny Shine event.

08:06.670 --> 08:08.540
- And so was Hailey,
I get it, I do,

08:08.570 --> 08:11.810
but I can't investigate every
family that has a missing kid

08:11.840 --> 08:14.210
on the off chance that
whoever brought you the card

08:14.240 --> 08:15.610
is just gonna show up--

08:37.169 --> 08:41.610
- Have you heard the good news
about God's kingdom on Earth?

08:43.169 --> 08:47.280
Have you heard the good news
about God's Kingdom on Earth?

08:50.080 --> 08:51.750
Have you heard
the good news about God--

08:53.050 --> 08:54.150
Have you heard
the good news about--

08:55.420 --> 08:57.590
Have you heard the good news
about God's kingdom on Earth?

08:59.920 --> 09:02.330
- Why, no, I haven't,

09:02.360 --> 09:04.330
but I would love to.

09:04.360 --> 09:06.560
Please, come in.

09:11.200 --> 09:13.940
- A field trip
to a cookie factory.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.370
Hailey would've loved this.

09:22.050 --> 09:24.980
- That asshole knows what's up.
Come on.

09:28.320 --> 09:30.250
Yo, Confucius.

09:30.290 --> 09:33.090
What say you point me out
to the boss man?

09:40.830 --> 09:42.330
- Ah, shit.

09:42.370 --> 09:44.730
- He said your face

09:44.770 --> 09:46.700
looks like it got ran over by--

09:46.740 --> 09:48.040
- Wait a minute,
you know Chinese?

09:48.070 --> 09:49.910
- Hailey and I
take Mandarin at the Y.

09:49.940 --> 09:51.270
- Get outta here.

09:51.310 --> 09:52.910
- It's the
language of the future.

09:52.940 --> 09:54.380
- Oh.

09:54.410 --> 09:55.910
- Our teacher gave us
a blue star on our last test.

09:55.950 --> 09:57.250
- No kidding.
- No big deal.

09:57.280 --> 10:00.280
- Forgive my grandfather.
He's totally senile.

10:00.320 --> 10:01.320
It's almost noon.

10:01.350 --> 10:05.190
Why don't you change out
of your jammies, pop-pop.

10:05.220 --> 10:06.360
Can I help you?

10:06.390 --> 10:08.160
- Yeah,
we're looking for the boss man.

10:08.190 --> 10:10.730
We, me, I.

10:10.760 --> 10:12.230
- You found her.

10:12.260 --> 10:14.230
- Oh.

10:18.100 --> 10:20.270
- Yup, it's one of ours.

10:20.300 --> 10:21.340
I'm not surprised.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.670
We're the sole distributor
in the tri-state area.

10:23.710 --> 10:24.870
And just between you and me--

10:24.910 --> 10:27.880
we're this close
to landing Delaware.

10:27.910 --> 10:29.180
- Mazel tov.

10:29.210 --> 10:30.710
I know this is ridiculous--

10:30.750 --> 10:31.980
any chance you can
tell me what restaurant

10:32.020 --> 10:32.980
that fortune came out of?

10:33.020 --> 10:34.280
- It's not ridiculous.

10:34.320 --> 10:36.420
It was written
a few years back.

10:36.450 --> 10:38.350
But sometimes cookies
stay on shelves

10:38.390 --> 10:41.020
for decades waiting
for their matches.

10:41.060 --> 10:43.730
- Their matches?

10:43.760 --> 10:46.300
- You don't think we send
these out at random, do you?

10:46.330 --> 10:47.730
- Mmm,

10:47.760 --> 10:48.970
kinda.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.870
- I think that was
the wrong answer.

10:50.900 --> 10:52.140
- Look, I've been
chasing around the block

10:52.170 --> 10:54.400
a few too many times
to believe in

10:54.440 --> 10:55.870
this mumbo jumbo.

10:55.910 --> 10:58.110
- The universe
has an order to it.

10:58.140 --> 10:59.940
Fortunes shed light
on that order.

10:59.980 --> 11:01.280
Each one is unique and each one

11:01.310 --> 11:03.750
finds the person
that's supposed to read it.

11:03.780 --> 11:05.850
- She's helping us,
Nick, be nice.

11:05.880 --> 11:11.020
- I'm gonna choose my words
very carefully, um...

11:11.050 --> 11:13.420
I can appreciate
in order to sell your dry,

11:13.460 --> 11:15.890
flavorless cookies, you
gotta peddle this story that,

11:15.930 --> 11:19.430
frankly, makes you sound
like a simple-minded asshole.

11:19.460 --> 11:21.870
But there

11:21.900 --> 11:25.170
is no such thing
as the cosmic order.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.210
The universe is a callous,
indifferent bitch,

11:29.240 --> 11:32.110
and it will fuck you
every chance it gets.

11:32.140 --> 11:33.780
And once you think
it's done with you,

11:33.810 --> 11:36.080
it will flip you right over
and fuck you from behind.

11:36.110 --> 11:37.950
- Do you think I'm afraid
of a skeptic?

11:37.980 --> 11:39.320
You don't dominate
the tri-state area

11:39.350 --> 11:42.350
and possibly Delaware
by being afraid skeptics.

11:45.090 --> 11:47.160
- I'm rock hard right now.

11:49.260 --> 11:52.100
- Think about it this way,
Mr. Sax.

11:52.130 --> 11:53.400
That fortune you read--

11:53.430 --> 11:55.360
it brought you here today,
didn't it?

11:55.400 --> 11:57.800
- Well, that,
and the number six bus.

11:57.830 --> 12:00.340
- Well, isn't that fortunate,

12:00.370 --> 12:03.440
because I know where
your cookie came from.

12:03.470 --> 12:05.210
Nom Wah Tea Parlor.

12:05.240 --> 12:08.910
- 181 Division Street?

12:08.950 --> 12:11.010
Where is that?

12:11.050 --> 12:12.420
- Ah, shit.

12:16.120 --> 12:17.990
Chinatown.

12:22.960 --> 12:26.930
- I was thinking about what
you said last night, Blue.

12:26.960 --> 12:29.470
- About turning off
the cameras?

12:29.500 --> 12:31.570
- About the man
who killed my boys--

12:31.600 --> 12:33.040
the hit man?

12:33.070 --> 12:35.000
- I wanna be a hit man
when I grow up, Daddy.

12:36.870 --> 12:38.110
- Gerry, please.

12:38.140 --> 12:39.310
- Why do you wanna
be a hit man, Gerry?

12:39.340 --> 12:41.880
- They get to kill people,
Auntie Isa.

12:41.910 --> 12:43.110
Oh, Jesus.

12:43.150 --> 12:45.250
- But, you know,
a hit man isn't just

12:45.280 --> 12:47.120
any kind of killer.

12:47.150 --> 12:49.190
He's a special type.

12:49.220 --> 12:50.950
He's not a sociopath.

12:50.990 --> 12:52.920
Sociopaths kill for pleasure.

12:52.960 --> 12:53.990
Understand?

12:54.020 --> 12:55.960
- For pleasure.
- Mm-hmm.

12:55.990 --> 12:58.900
A hit man is a businessman.

12:58.930 --> 13:01.130
He kills for money.

13:01.160 --> 13:05.100
So, the question becomes

13:05.130 --> 13:09.140
who paid that man
to kill my boys?

13:10.910 --> 13:15.080
- Okay, the truth is

13:15.110 --> 13:19.380
I think it may have been
a revenge killing.

13:19.420 --> 13:20.980
- Revenge?

13:21.020 --> 13:23.190
- It's no secret that

13:23.220 --> 13:27.160
I have done some
bad things in my time.

13:27.190 --> 13:30.030
I haven't always
been a good man.

13:30.060 --> 13:32.630
Ah, no, it's true.

13:32.660 --> 13:37.170
But there is one low
to which I have never sunk,

13:37.200 --> 13:41.040
and I never will.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.270
This...

13:44.270 --> 13:47.540
So-called reality TV.

13:47.580 --> 13:49.910
It is a virus, Isabella.

13:50.950 --> 13:51.920
- I'll get it.

13:51.950 --> 13:53.350
- Sit down!

13:54.620 --> 14:00.120
Now, does society
punish you for this?

14:00.160 --> 14:01.890
No.

14:01.930 --> 14:05.660
It rewards you lavishly.

14:05.690 --> 14:09.300
Perhaps looking down from

14:09.330 --> 14:13.100
a 100 million feet
up in the sky,

14:13.140 --> 14:14.670
our lord...

14:16.570 --> 14:19.540
decided to take matters
into his own hands.

14:19.580 --> 14:21.310
He said,

14:21.340 --> 14:24.080
this is not right.

14:24.110 --> 14:27.080
This is not the world
that I labored

14:27.120 --> 14:28.680
for seven days to create.

14:28.720 --> 14:31.190
This is not what
I wanted for the people

14:31.220 --> 14:36.960
for whom I sacrificed
my own son to save.

14:36.990 --> 14:42.600
And so, Isabella,
as is his way,

14:42.630 --> 14:47.140
God smote you.

14:47.170 --> 14:49.970
He took his revenge on you,

14:50.010 --> 14:51.980
tit for tat,

14:52.010 --> 14:55.580
killed your boys the way
he killed those poor little

14:55.610 --> 14:59.650
Egyptian babies
back in historical times.

14:59.680 --> 15:04.320
All because of the unfortunate
choices made by a parent.

15:07.360 --> 15:09.590
It's not my fault.

15:09.630 --> 15:13.400
It's not even
the hit man's fault.

15:13.430 --> 15:17.170
It's yours, Isabella.

15:17.200 --> 15:19.540
You.

15:19.570 --> 15:21.370
You killed them.

15:28.340 --> 15:30.310
I'm gonna get that.

15:37.050 --> 15:39.190
- Frappuccino?

16:03.150 --> 16:04.450
Blue.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.580
Thank you for coming
in on such short notice.

16:06.620 --> 16:08.320
- Of course.

16:08.350 --> 16:09.720
I serve at your pleasure,
Mr. Bug--

16:09.750 --> 16:15.020
- You know what bugs
crave more than anything?

16:15.060 --> 16:19.330
- Dead flesh?

16:19.360 --> 16:20.700
Dead things?

16:22.770 --> 16:24.600
- Darkness.

16:24.630 --> 16:26.470
The shadows.

16:26.500 --> 16:29.310
The inside of a wall,
the underside of a rock.

16:29.340 --> 16:31.070
The holes in the cheese,

16:31.110 --> 16:35.340
the cavities of the world,
one could say.

16:35.380 --> 16:38.780
So, what do bugs loathe

16:38.810 --> 16:40.580
more than anything?

16:43.350 --> 16:44.690
- The light?

16:44.720 --> 16:46.820
- Exposure!

16:46.860 --> 16:49.490
You come into a room at night,

16:49.530 --> 16:51.230
you flip the switch,

16:51.260 --> 16:52.800
they scatter to every corner.

16:52.830 --> 16:55.100
You understand.

16:56.670 --> 16:59.200
- I understand.

16:59.240 --> 17:03.510
- Do you, though?

17:03.540 --> 17:06.510
Because fuzzy or not,
I know exactly who that is.

17:07.540 --> 17:12.280
- There are Jenners
less exposed than this.

17:12.319 --> 17:15.480
- It's a family issue.

17:15.520 --> 17:17.589
I'll squash it--
no, deal with it.

17:17.619 --> 17:20.089
I will--
- That's not all.

17:20.119 --> 17:23.660
Your guy, Mr. Ho Ho Ho?

17:23.690 --> 17:25.760
- Junior Mozell?

17:25.790 --> 17:30.200
He's under strict orders
to stay with the--

17:30.230 --> 17:31.200
the cargo.

17:31.230 --> 17:33.870
- Oh, just say it, Blue.

17:33.900 --> 17:35.200
- The children.

17:35.240 --> 17:37.440
I don't

17:37.470 --> 17:40.440
want to second guess
the way you do business, Blue,

17:40.480 --> 17:45.410
but the people you employ
do reflect on you.

17:45.450 --> 17:48.680
Ugh, I mean, the Santa suit,
it's a little...

17:48.720 --> 17:51.420
It's a little, camp,
don't you think?

17:51.450 --> 17:52.820
Everyone loves Christmas,

17:52.860 --> 17:56.560
but perhaps he's taking it
a little too far.

17:56.590 --> 17:59.300
Do you really think
he's stable enough

17:59.330 --> 18:01.700
to trust with work this...

18:01.730 --> 18:06.700
sensitive?

18:06.740 --> 18:09.340
- Yes, he does put
his heart into his work,

18:09.370 --> 18:11.410
but what more could we--
- Listen to me.

18:11.440 --> 18:12.780
It's only a few days
until Christmas,

18:12.810 --> 18:15.840
and I need
those deliveries made.

18:15.880 --> 18:18.850
They are important gifts
for important people,

18:18.880 --> 18:21.380
and I expect them
to be bright and shining

18:21.420 --> 18:23.890
under the tree
Christmas morning.

18:23.920 --> 18:25.450
- Got it, got it.

18:25.490 --> 18:27.890
- I'd like you
to accelerate things.

18:27.920 --> 18:31.360
We'll transfer the children
to the prep stage tonight.

18:32.660 --> 18:34.930
- Yes, sir.

18:42.970 --> 18:45.210
- When I'm finished with you,

18:45.240 --> 18:47.280
you are going to regret

18:47.310 --> 18:51.610
not having done this sooner.

18:51.650 --> 18:53.380
Warm.

18:53.420 --> 18:55.450
- Yes, warm.

18:55.480 --> 18:57.490
You have such
a way with words.

18:57.520 --> 19:00.260
Not to bore you
with shop talk, but this wax--

19:00.290 --> 19:02.360
when it's poured
into the nostrils--

19:02.390 --> 19:03.530
Perfection.

19:03.560 --> 19:05.530
It restricts
the breathing passages.

19:05.560 --> 19:07.500
Not enough to kill you,

19:07.530 --> 19:10.270
just enough to trigger
excruciating pain

19:10.300 --> 19:12.770
as the blood vessels burst.

19:12.800 --> 19:15.640
Well,
what am I rattling on about?

19:15.670 --> 19:18.710
Oh, it'll also--
there we go--

19:18.740 --> 19:21.310
take five years off your hands.

19:22.410 --> 19:25.680
So, they'll only look 80.

19:28.420 --> 19:32.220
Oh, now, now, now,
don't be greedy.

19:32.260 --> 19:35.590
As captivating as it is
to stare into those empty,

19:35.620 --> 19:37.660
vacant eyes for hours on end,

19:37.690 --> 19:40.730
well,
every pleasure has its limits.

19:40.760 --> 19:43.730
And I need some Smoothie time.

19:43.770 --> 19:45.370
Need.

19:45.400 --> 19:49.840
So, you just sit tight

19:49.870 --> 19:51.770
and watch TV.

19:51.810 --> 19:56.680
Oh, look,
it's your favorite show.

19:58.750 --> 20:01.320
- That's it,
that's it, that's it.

20:01.350 --> 20:02.890
Go.

20:07.960 --> 20:11.560
- This is the first nice thing
that I have done for myself

20:11.590 --> 20:14.660
in a long time.

20:23.040 --> 20:26.410
- Hold up.
- ♪ Ga Ga, ooh la la

20:26.440 --> 20:28.310
♪ Want your--

20:28.340 --> 20:29.580
- Smoothie.

20:29.610 --> 20:30.850
- Where the hell are you?

20:32.350 --> 20:34.650
- I am at the McCarthy's

20:34.680 --> 20:36.650
with Jessica like you put me.

20:36.690 --> 20:38.320
- The bug is upset.

20:38.350 --> 20:39.590
We're making some changes

20:39.620 --> 20:41.460
and I need you
to do a scrub down.

20:41.490 --> 20:42.990
Today--now.

20:43.030 --> 20:44.630
- Well, I am in
the middle of something.

20:44.660 --> 20:46.760
- So, get out of it.

20:50.570 --> 20:51.770
- Shit.

20:54.870 --> 20:56.610
Okay.

21:08.420 --> 21:10.490
Come on, man.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.720
I'm not the guy you're after.

21:12.760 --> 21:14.520
Yo, I'm basically FedEx.

21:14.560 --> 21:15.760
Would you kill FedEx?

21:15.790 --> 21:17.660
- You work for murderers.

21:17.690 --> 21:19.760
- I don't know
nothing about that.

21:19.800 --> 21:21.500
I mean, you work for NYPD.

21:21.530 --> 21:24.630
Pretty sure they're not all
saints up there; am I right?

21:24.670 --> 21:26.370
- You see this lock of hair?

21:26.400 --> 21:28.370
It belonged to a boy named Cal.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.040
He is nine years old.

21:30.070 --> 21:32.510
This is not gonna be
a merry Christmas for Cal.

21:32.540 --> 21:34.380
- If he's not dead already.

21:34.410 --> 21:36.650
Look at it.

21:36.680 --> 21:38.610
- I just deliver envelopes,

21:38.650 --> 21:40.480
point A to point B.

21:40.520 --> 21:41.780
The cash is good, all right?

21:41.820 --> 21:43.090
Look, I'm just trying
to put myself

21:43.120 --> 21:44.090
through Juilliard, okay?

21:44.120 --> 21:45.950
This shit is not cheap.

21:45.990 --> 21:47.520
- Juilliard?

21:47.560 --> 21:50.360
- You like music?

21:50.390 --> 21:51.390
- Piano.

21:51.430 --> 21:53.130
- What?

21:53.160 --> 21:54.630
- I play piano.

21:54.660 --> 21:56.770
Jazz.

21:56.800 --> 21:59.840
I'ma be the
black Bill Evans, see?

21:59.870 --> 22:03.510
I'm not some kind of monster,
all right?

22:03.540 --> 22:05.110
- Piano.

22:16.020 --> 22:16.950
- Oh.

22:16.990 --> 22:19.960
Okay.
All right, please, please!

22:19.990 --> 22:21.820
Come on, man!
This is harassment!

22:21.860 --> 22:24.430
- How's your finger feel
on that throttle, Ms. Hansen?

22:24.460 --> 22:26.030
- Twitchy.

22:26.060 --> 22:27.700
- Part of you wants to squeeze
it just to see what'll happen?

22:27.730 --> 22:28.700
- A real big part.

22:28.730 --> 22:29.970
- You are gonna tell us

22:30.000 --> 22:32.770
where you got that envelope,
Liberace,

22:32.800 --> 22:35.800
or you're gonna need
chopsticks to play Chopsticks.

22:35.840 --> 22:37.140
You understand?

22:39.610 --> 22:42.010
- Okay!
All right, all right.

22:42.040 --> 22:42.980
It's a dead drop.

22:43.010 --> 22:46.620
They page me an address,
they leave it for me.

22:46.650 --> 22:48.420
- There you go.

22:50.590 --> 22:51.850
- Piano nothing.

22:51.890 --> 22:54.990
Singing's your forte.

22:55.020 --> 22:57.160
All right, listen,
you need to go home.

22:57.190 --> 22:58.590
- Not a chance.

22:58.630 --> 23:00.460
- All right,
I was wrong about you,

23:00.500 --> 23:02.870
and maybe Nick was too--
you're tough as shit.

23:02.900 --> 23:04.100
But what I'm walking into--

23:04.130 --> 23:06.130
you're gonna be
a liability to me.

23:06.170 --> 23:08.440
And to her.

23:08.470 --> 23:10.510
I can either take you
back to the station

23:10.540 --> 23:11.770
and lock you up again,

23:11.810 --> 23:14.980
or you can go home
and get some rest.

23:15.010 --> 23:18.750
I will call you as soon
as I know anything.

23:18.780 --> 23:19.750
I promise.

23:28.120 --> 23:32.530
- Nick, I think this cat
is trying to tell me something.

23:32.560 --> 23:33.600
But what?

23:33.630 --> 23:35.130
Ah, come on.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.500
- Look at all
the pretty plastic food.

23:39.540 --> 23:43.210
All of the paper lanterns
and the funny hats.

23:43.240 --> 23:44.810
I don't get it, Nick.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.580
Why do you hate
Chinatown so much?

23:48.210 --> 23:50.180
- Oh, pai gow, moth--oh!

23:50.210 --> 23:51.780
This deck hates me.

23:51.810 --> 23:54.080
- ♪ Tonight's the night
we're gonna ♪

23:54.120 --> 23:56.180
Not again.

23:56.220 --> 23:59.520
- ♪ Tonight we'll put
all other things aside ♪

23:59.560 --> 24:01.190
- You're a guy, aren't you?

24:01.220 --> 24:02.790
Eh.

24:02.830 --> 24:04.760
- ♪ I want to love you,
feel you ♪

24:04.790 --> 24:06.630
- I love a story
with a happy ending.

24:06.660 --> 24:08.760
- I know I never pass one up.

24:08.800 --> 24:11.100
All right, this is the place.

24:16.040 --> 24:18.910
- Nick Sax, NYPD...ish.

24:18.940 --> 24:20.540
I'm trying to locate a man--

24:20.580 --> 24:22.280
eats here, maybe he orders in.

24:22.310 --> 24:25.080
Uh, big, smelly animal.

24:25.110 --> 24:27.280
Looks like Santa Claus
if you ran him over

24:27.320 --> 24:31.220
with a mack truck and
sprayed him with cat piss.

24:35.660 --> 24:37.630
Uh...

24:37.660 --> 24:39.290
All right,
hit me with Mandarin.

24:39.330 --> 24:40.300
Slow.

24:40.330 --> 24:42.060
- I got this.

24:42.100 --> 24:44.570
Repeat after me.

24:51.810 --> 24:53.140
Is that for real?

24:53.180 --> 24:54.310
That means yes, Nick.

24:54.340 --> 24:55.910
- Well, give it to--

24:55.940 --> 24:57.880
Give it to me
slowly, will you, please?

25:07.260 --> 25:08.620
- Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

25:08.660 --> 25:10.790
Keep it going.

26:00.880 --> 26:02.240
- All right.

26:05.310 --> 26:08.150
Not bad.

26:08.180 --> 26:09.850
I had my doubts.

26:14.220 --> 26:15.190
What the--

26:15.220 --> 26:17.960
- Yin-Yang fish.
Dead and alive.

26:19.190 --> 26:21.400
- Blue star at the Y, huh?

26:21.430 --> 26:22.830
Real impressive.

26:26.130 --> 26:27.340
- Did she curse me out?

26:27.370 --> 26:30.010
- She says to wait
for the boy to help us.

26:30.040 --> 26:31.010
- All right, fine, I'll wait,

26:31.040 --> 26:32.840
but I ain't eating that.

27:13.520 --> 27:16.180
- I can't believe you did that.

27:16.220 --> 27:18.120
- It was the humane
thing to do.

27:21.490 --> 27:25.790
- All right,
let's rev up the engines.

27:28.930 --> 27:30.100
- Dude, speak English.

27:30.130 --> 27:31.100
How much weed do you want?

27:31.130 --> 27:33.800
- Ah, no, no, no, I'm not--

27:33.840 --> 27:34.970
yeah, maybe a J.

27:35.000 --> 27:36.870
Um, but I'm also here
looking for a guy

27:36.910 --> 27:38.770
who orders out
of this restaurant.

27:38.810 --> 27:41.940
Looks like
Santa Claus if he was

27:41.980 --> 27:43.180
dragged through a swamp,

27:43.210 --> 27:44.380
doused some gasoline
on himself.

27:44.410 --> 27:46.750
- Yeah,
I remember a dude like that.

27:46.780 --> 27:49.020
Buys in bulk,
couple times a week.

27:49.050 --> 27:50.290
Every week.

27:50.320 --> 27:53.120
Spare ribs,
Moo Shu, crab Rangoon.

27:53.160 --> 27:54.960
Extra fortune cookies.

27:54.990 --> 27:56.890
You don't look
like immigration.

27:56.930 --> 27:58.290
- Immigration?

27:58.330 --> 28:00.060
- Dude orders enough
to feed 50 Cambodians.

28:00.100 --> 28:02.230
Anyway,
seems like no one lives there.

28:02.260 --> 28:05.900
I figure it must be some kind
of underground sweatshop--

28:05.930 --> 28:07.470
whorehouse, maybe.

28:07.500 --> 28:10.010
- Color me twice as interested.
Where's that?

28:10.040 --> 28:13.110
- In one of those old buildings
down near South and Rutgers.

28:13.140 --> 28:15.380
- South and Rutgers?
Let's be specific, kid.

28:15.410 --> 28:17.380
God is in the details.

28:17.410 --> 28:18.980
- Oh, sure,
let me just check

28:19.010 --> 28:21.050
my digital delivery boy log
for the coordinates.

28:21.080 --> 28:22.380
Beep beep boop boop--

28:22.420 --> 28:23.890
Ugh!

28:23.920 --> 28:26.350
- Look,
I'm trying to save a life here.

28:26.390 --> 28:28.960
My patience has run out
for the black hole

28:28.990 --> 28:31.290
of Millennial sarcasm
that is your brain.

28:31.330 --> 28:32.530
Now...
- Ahh!

28:32.560 --> 28:34.260
- Take me to that building,

28:34.300 --> 28:37.230
or I'm gonna snap your wrist
back over your delivery bike

28:37.270 --> 28:40.170
and smoke all your weed.
You got that?

28:42.300 --> 28:43.840
- Get up.

28:49.380 --> 28:51.880
- Ah, sweet Jesus, help me.

28:51.910 --> 28:54.980
- Serves you right
for being a P-I-G.

29:00.390 --> 29:02.420
- "Next time, try duck."

29:02.460 --> 29:04.130
Now you tell me.

29:04.160 --> 29:05.360
- What's that, Nick?

29:05.390 --> 29:06.560
- Eh, dopey fortune says,

29:06.590 --> 29:08.030
"Next time, try--"

29:08.060 --> 29:09.400
- Duck!

29:23.410 --> 29:25.850
- Ahh!

29:25.880 --> 29:27.550
Ugh!

29:46.170 --> 29:47.570
Look, Hap!

29:47.600 --> 29:49.170
Yin-Yang Asshole.

29:49.200 --> 29:51.170
- Ah, look out, Nick!

29:58.610 --> 30:01.950
- You can hide,
but you can't run, Sax!

30:11.130 --> 30:12.490
- It's a shame there's
only five of you--

30:12.530 --> 30:14.430
with six, you get eggroll.

30:14.460 --> 30:16.970
- Wow, that is so offensive.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.130
- Offensive? You guys
are trying to kill me!

30:19.170 --> 30:20.400
- Oh, no, Sax.

30:20.440 --> 30:23.240
We're gonna kill you.

30:55.240 --> 30:57.040
- Ugh, shit.

31:01.680 --> 31:03.380
Shove that slinky
right up your--

31:03.410 --> 31:06.210
Oww, shit, that hurt!

31:06.250 --> 31:08.680
God damn it.

31:08.720 --> 31:11.220
- Shouldn't have come
to Chinatown, Sax.

31:11.250 --> 31:13.160
- Well, trust me there, Elvis,

31:13.190 --> 31:15.560
I never wanted to set foot
in this sputum stained shithole

31:15.590 --> 31:17.090
of a tourist trap
for the rest of my life,

31:17.130 --> 31:19.930
but today
I'm a man on a mission.

31:24.500 --> 31:25.570
Whoa.

31:40.250 --> 31:41.980
Chinatown.

31:42.020 --> 31:45.190
All right, come on, let's go
find Rutgers and South street.

31:51.530 --> 31:54.430
Ah, crap, more of 'em?

31:54.460 --> 31:56.200
- Yoo-hoo, Nick!

31:56.230 --> 31:58.200
Up here!

32:22.060 --> 32:24.590
Did you bring what I asked for?

32:24.630 --> 32:26.130
- Si, Signora.

32:26.160 --> 32:27.430
- Grazie.

32:27.460 --> 32:29.200
Si accomodati.

32:37.170 --> 32:39.640
A cheeseburger.

32:42.540 --> 32:44.680
Grazie.

32:44.710 --> 32:49.050
And what brings you here today,
my dear?

32:49.080 --> 32:53.260
- I'm just so broken-hearted,
Signora.

32:54.360 --> 32:57.790
I need to know who did this.

32:57.830 --> 33:01.730
I need to know
who killed my babies.

33:01.760 --> 33:04.430
- Once you know the truth,

33:04.470 --> 33:07.300
you cannot un-know it.

33:07.340 --> 33:09.270
Capisci?

33:10.570 --> 33:13.480
- Yes. Si.

33:37.670 --> 33:39.730
Grazie.
- Mamma.

33:41.270 --> 33:43.610
Nonna.

33:43.640 --> 33:46.440
Bisnonna.

33:46.470 --> 33:51.150
Mostrami i figli Di Isabella.

34:04.890 --> 34:07.200
Oh.

34:07.230 --> 34:09.600
I see them now.

34:09.630 --> 34:10.770
- Si?

34:10.800 --> 34:13.300
- They are together.

34:13.340 --> 34:16.739
They are in peace.

34:16.770 --> 34:18.670
And they love you.

34:18.710 --> 34:21.210
Very much.

34:29.820 --> 34:32.219
They warn you.

34:32.250 --> 34:35.520
You have an enemy
in your house,

34:35.560 --> 34:38.389
and this enemy

34:38.429 --> 34:42.400
is the one who killed
your three sons.

34:46.770 --> 34:49.540
What is she saying?

34:49.570 --> 34:51.610
Three? There's four.

34:51.639 --> 34:53.739
- Che me dici?

34:56.540 --> 34:58.150
What?

35:05.690 --> 35:08.790
Mikey is not with them.

35:13.600 --> 35:14.800
Mrs. Scaramucci,
what are you--

35:14.830 --> 35:16.360
- I wanna see my sons.

35:16.400 --> 35:19.500
- I'm in the middle
of a very delicate op--

35:50.600 --> 35:50.830
- Uh...

35:51.900 --> 35:53.440
- You sure we're going
the right way?

35:53.470 --> 35:54.870
- Eh, sure I'm sure.

35:54.900 --> 35:57.570
It's...

35:57.610 --> 35:59.840
Yeah, there's the bridge,
right there.

35:59.870 --> 36:01.480
That, uh...

36:01.510 --> 36:05.280
That means we're going east,
then.

36:05.310 --> 36:07.820
I think we're going east,

36:07.850 --> 36:09.680
or is that east?

36:09.720 --> 36:12.620
It means
the building's gotta be, uh...

36:14.990 --> 36:16.990
God damn it.

36:17.020 --> 36:18.860
- You can't be lost, Nick?

36:18.890 --> 36:21.830
- I've been lost 20 years.

36:21.860 --> 36:23.830
Trust me, I know lost.

36:23.870 --> 36:24.870
- Nick...

36:26.970 --> 36:29.440
What are you doing?

36:29.470 --> 36:31.570
- What am I doing?

36:31.610 --> 36:33.310
I'm running around
like an idiot

36:33.340 --> 36:36.240
because of a fortune cookie!

36:36.280 --> 36:39.880
Gotta be 20-something
buildings in one block!

36:39.910 --> 36:43.620
Santa could be in any
one of them or none of them!

36:47.020 --> 36:49.590
You understand what I'm saying?

36:49.620 --> 36:51.390
We've run out of luck.

36:51.430 --> 36:53.500
Wait, hold on.

36:53.530 --> 36:56.400
Oh.
Maybe not completely.

37:13.480 --> 37:15.350
I have no idea what
you're doing back there,

37:15.380 --> 37:16.850
but I want it to stop.

37:18.650 --> 37:20.620
Are you doing jazz hooves?

37:20.660 --> 37:22.890
- I'm doing the dance of hope.

37:22.920 --> 37:25.030
- Is that to get around
the no-singing rule?

37:25.060 --> 37:26.660
Because this
is just as annoying.

37:26.690 --> 37:28.500
- No,
there's always hope, Nick.

37:28.530 --> 37:29.860
- Always hope.

37:29.900 --> 37:31.630
There's always hope.

37:31.670 --> 37:34.770
Let me tell you a little
something about hope.

37:34.800 --> 37:37.810
Hope is like this lighter!

37:38.740 --> 37:40.580
Screw it,
you dance all you want.

37:40.610 --> 37:42.440
I don't give a shit.
And you know something?

37:42.480 --> 37:45.050
If you think that
a bolt is gonna come out

37:45.080 --> 37:48.080
of the blue and miraculously
just light our way--

37:52.550 --> 37:54.420
Holy shit.

37:54.460 --> 37:55.760
- Oh, my God, Nick.

37:55.790 --> 37:57.790
Gimbel's is where
Santa's daddy worked.

37:57.830 --> 38:00.860
- I know, that's why
I just said "holy shit."

38:04.530 --> 38:05.830
All right.

38:05.870 --> 38:07.440
All right, now--

38:07.470 --> 38:09.600
don't even say it,
don't even say it.

38:09.640 --> 38:11.070
Don't say it.

38:22.720 --> 38:25.490
- I thought you said
this place was ritzy.

38:25.520 --> 38:28.020
- Yeah, well,
it was when I was a kid.

38:30.830 --> 38:34.030
- Oh, I remember
how hard it was for Hailey

38:34.060 --> 38:36.830
to learn how to tie her shoes.

38:36.860 --> 38:39.000
But she did learn.

38:39.030 --> 38:41.100
Sometimes I miss her so bad,

38:41.140 --> 38:44.840
I just close my eyes
and remember

38:44.870 --> 38:47.480
that time we learned
to make our own pizzas,

38:47.510 --> 38:49.080
or when we went
to the planetarium

38:49.110 --> 38:50.710
and looked through
the telescope.

38:50.750 --> 38:53.980
And we could see Pluto
like we were right there.

38:54.020 --> 38:56.580
- Memories fade.

38:56.620 --> 38:59.050
Or they start to hurt.

38:59.090 --> 39:01.520
And then one day you wake up,
and the newspaper's telling you

39:01.560 --> 39:05.690
that Pluto's no longer
a planet.

39:05.730 --> 39:09.600
Like none of it ever happened.

39:09.630 --> 39:11.530
All right, come on.

39:11.570 --> 39:12.870
- Where to?

39:17.470 --> 39:18.910
- Women's Casuals.

40:45.830 --> 40:49.560

40:49.600 --> 40:51.100

They're going to save us.

41:25.630 --> 41:29.540

41:33.710 --> 41:35.210
I don't know.
