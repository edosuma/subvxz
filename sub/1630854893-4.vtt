WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:03.320
(upbeat pop-rock music)

00:06.800 --> 00:09.800
(singer vocalising)

00:30.120 --> 00:31.980
(birds chirping)

00:32.080 --> 00:35.560
(serene thoughtful music)

01:14.520 --> 01:18.880
(serene thoughtful music continues)

01:27.680 --> 01:29.300
(door creaks)

01:29.400 --> 01:30.700
(door clunking)

01:30.800 --> 01:32.140
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:32.240 --> 01:36.500
Nanna, do you know how
old we are exactly? (laughs)

01:36.600 --> 01:38.380
We worked it out on the bus.

01:38.480 --> 01:40.060
Oh, um-

01:40.160 --> 01:42.980
Six years, two months, and four days.

01:43.080 --> 01:46.020
(laughs) Oh, great.

01:46.120 --> 01:47.740
- Well, come on.
- Come on.

01:47.840 --> 01:49.100
[Pam] Come on.

01:49.200 --> 01:49.940
- Hi
- Hey.

01:50.040 --> 01:52.040
Do you gonna go through into the garden?

01:59.720 --> 02:01.740
Is Charlie here?

02:01.840 --> 02:03.100
No.

02:03.200 --> 02:05.200
No, he isn't.

02:05.720 --> 02:07.720
He didn't want anything to do with it.

02:09.680 --> 02:12.440
(door clunking)

02:14.320 --> 02:17.360
(laughs) What are they?

02:18.760 --> 02:20.620
They're for you.

02:20.720 --> 02:21.820
I mean...

02:21.920 --> 02:23.700
(both laughing)

02:23.800 --> 02:27.280
(light upbeat R&B music)

02:31.320 --> 02:33.460
What if your dad walks in?

02:33.560 --> 02:35.660
Well, then he'll go,

02:35.760 --> 02:40.100
"Good, my daughter's chosen a
man so young and spontaneous."

02:40.200 --> 02:41.180
(both laughing)

02:41.280 --> 02:44.040
That seems unlikely. (laughs)

02:54.320 --> 02:56.180
What made you wanna redecorate now?

02:56.280 --> 02:58.800
It's been six years, it's time to...

03:00.760 --> 03:03.220
It's not like she's coming back, is she?

03:03.320 --> 03:05.320
No.

03:06.600 --> 03:07.860
[Pam] Oh, I found this.

03:07.960 --> 03:10.880
I thought you and the kids
could look through it.

03:13.520 --> 03:15.700
Yeah. Thank you.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.140
I will bring it back.

03:17.240 --> 03:20.320
(children squealing)

03:22.640 --> 03:23.780
(children laughing)

03:23.880 --> 03:24.980
[Poppy] I got you.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.140
[Jack] I got you back!

03:27.240 --> 03:29.240
Do you still, um,

03:31.960 --> 03:34.100
talk to God?

03:34.200 --> 03:36.200
Not for a while.

03:38.240 --> 03:42.460
Six years, two months, and four days.

03:42.560 --> 03:45.500
(gentle thoughtful music)

03:45.600 --> 03:48.160
"There's a reason people
say you fall in love.

03:49.760 --> 03:52.320
"There's a reason people
say you fall in love.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.920
"There's a reason people say you fall...

03:57.800 --> 03:59.800
"It was a fall. I fell.

04:00.840 --> 04:02.660
"It was an accident."

04:02.760 --> 04:03.500
(script rustling)

04:03.600 --> 04:05.220
(light upbeat pop music)

04:05.320 --> 04:06.820
Why do you keep walking like that?

04:06.920 --> 04:09.060
I don't know. What's he like?

04:09.160 --> 04:10.020
Who?

04:10.120 --> 04:11.140
Cameron.

04:11.240 --> 04:12.060
He's nice.

04:12.160 --> 04:13.140
How nice?

04:13.240 --> 04:14.140
Nicer than you.

04:14.240 --> 04:16.240
That's a low bar.

04:19.000 --> 04:19.980
[Harry] Hey!

04:20.080 --> 04:21.940
Hey!

04:22.040 --> 04:23.380
This is Cameron.

04:23.480 --> 04:24.220
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:24.320 --> 04:25.060
Nice to finally meet you.

04:25.160 --> 04:26.020
Yeah, you too.

04:26.120 --> 04:26.980
Though I should warn you,

04:27.080 --> 04:28.780
I'm much less interesting in real life.

04:28.880 --> 04:29.740
(Cameron laughs)

04:29.840 --> 04:30.620
No, I mean it.

04:30.720 --> 04:33.100
This could be a very
disappointing evening for you.

04:33.200 --> 04:34.420
(Cameron laughs)

04:34.520 --> 04:36.220
Um, this is my sister Emma.

04:36.320 --> 04:38.780
Hi. I'm basically just
here so she can meet you.

04:38.880 --> 04:40.020
I'm sure that's not true.

04:40.120 --> 04:40.860
No, it is.

04:40.960 --> 04:42.980
- Do you want a drink?
- Yes!

04:43.080 --> 04:44.700
I think I'm gonna need one.

04:44.800 --> 04:46.900
Come on.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.380
It's gonna be a fun night!

04:48.480 --> 04:50.420
- I know!
- Yeah.

04:50.520 --> 04:55.500
(people chattering)
(upbeat dance music)

04:55.600 --> 04:56.580
- Hey!
- Yeah.

04:56.680 --> 04:58.460
- Drinks.
- Drinks.

04:58.560 --> 05:00.020
- Thank you.
- Take one of them.

05:00.120 --> 05:02.020
So Harry tells me you're an actress?

05:02.120 --> 05:02.980
Barely. (laughs)

05:03.080 --> 05:04.460
Why would anyone want to be an actress?

05:04.560 --> 05:05.780
Fame and fortune.

05:05.880 --> 05:07.700
How's that working out for you?

05:07.800 --> 05:09.460
- Not as I'd hoped.
- Hmm.

05:09.560 --> 05:10.620
I don't know why you bother.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.140
Uh, because she's amazing,

05:12.240 --> 05:14.260
and it's all gonna work out one day.

05:14.360 --> 05:15.060
Thank you.

05:15.160 --> 05:16.420
I don't know, I'm pretty drunk,

05:16.520 --> 05:18.340
so if you remind me I
said that I'll deny it.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.020
(Emma laughs)

05:20.120 --> 05:20.860
Anyway, cheers!

05:20.960 --> 05:22.960
Cheers!

05:38.480 --> 05:41.160
(door creaking)

05:53.760 --> 05:57.320
(gentle thoughtful music)

06:25.120 --> 06:27.960
(water splashing)

06:36.680 --> 06:41.680
(people chattering)
(upbeat hip-hop music)

06:56.560 --> 06:57.740
Here you go.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.500
If you're trying to get me drunk,

06:59.600 --> 07:00.900
you should know that train has well

07:01.000 --> 07:03.000
and truly left the station.

07:08.240 --> 07:11.420
Joey! Come, regale us with
tales of your sexual piracy!

07:11.520 --> 07:12.940
(Joey laughs)

07:13.040 --> 07:14.220
Joey!

07:14.320 --> 07:19.320
(water splashes)
(thoughtful dramatic music)

07:22.880 --> 07:24.860
[Dee] So you know your
ex-girlfriend, Emma?

07:24.960 --> 07:27.100
She's not my ex-girlfriend.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.200
Daddy, I've got one.

07:29.520 --> 07:31.060
[Ben] A film.

07:31.160 --> 07:32.980
One word.

07:33.080 --> 07:33.860
[Ben] "Frozen."

07:33.960 --> 07:34.820
Yeah!

07:34.920 --> 07:39.320
So, yeah, her play opens
on Thursday, are you going?

07:40.320 --> 07:41.060
No.

07:41.160 --> 07:43.700
Well, I've got two tickets,
and I'm not going on my own.

07:43.800 --> 07:44.560
Why can't Francesca go with you?

07:44.560 --> 07:46.660
Because my wife does
not enjoy the theatre.

07:46.760 --> 07:47.460
Neither do I.

07:47.560 --> 07:49.660
Yeah, but I'm your boss.

07:49.760 --> 07:50.660
- Mummy!
- Hello!

07:50.760 --> 07:52.260
I've got one.

07:52.360 --> 07:54.060
Film.

07:54.160 --> 07:55.740
Six words.

07:55.840 --> 07:57.820
"Harry Potter and the
Philosophers Stone."

07:57.920 --> 07:59.780
- Yes.
- Go.

07:59.880 --> 08:04.880
[Ben] Ruby, what were you
gonna do for "Philosophers"?

08:05.200 --> 08:06.620
That's quite good, actually.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.500
(both laughing)

08:08.600 --> 08:10.600
So.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.060
Fine, yes, I'll go.

08:15.160 --> 08:18.760
(gentle thoughtful music)

08:21.800 --> 08:24.980
[Emma] That's what happened to me.

08:25.080 --> 08:28.180
I fell in love, people got hurt.

08:28.280 --> 08:30.220
It's something that happens to you.

08:30.320 --> 08:32.220
It's not a choice.

08:32.320 --> 08:35.100
That's why sometimes people get hurt.

08:35.200 --> 08:38.800
But I realise now I
had no control over it.

08:40.880 --> 08:42.740
We did an MRI,

08:42.840 --> 08:46.340
and there's no damage
to the spinal cord, so-

08:46.440 --> 08:48.620
You are so lucky.

08:48.720 --> 08:51.060
You are so, so lucky.

08:51.160 --> 08:54.140
I mean, I fell off a
roof, so not that lucky.

08:54.240 --> 08:57.000
(both chuckling)

08:58.760 --> 09:01.300
There's something we should discuss.

09:01.400 --> 09:05.500
I'm afraid the MRI showed
that you have a DIPG.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.940
A diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma.

09:08.040 --> 09:10.040
What is that?

09:10.520 --> 09:13.880
I'm sorry to say it's a brain tumour.

09:14.800 --> 09:17.420
No, I'm sorry, she fell.

09:17.520 --> 09:20.620
I know I'm not a doctor, but
you don't get a brain tumour

09:20.720 --> 09:22.780
from falling off a roof.

09:22.880 --> 09:24.880
She already had it.

09:26.120 --> 09:28.500
If you hadn't have been
rushed in here tonight,

09:28.600 --> 09:29.360
you might never have known and-

09:29.360 --> 09:31.440
So what do we do?

09:34.400 --> 09:36.400
I'm so sorry.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.920
There's very little we can do.

09:40.840 --> 09:42.840
It's inoperable, I'm afraid.

09:45.760 --> 09:48.100
(light reflective music)

09:48.200 --> 09:50.420
[Joey] You know what the
worst part of all this is?

09:50.520 --> 09:52.500
What?

09:52.600 --> 09:54.100
Mum's outfit.

09:54.200 --> 09:57.200
I mean, what are we even going for, here?

09:58.080 --> 09:59.220
(parents laughing)

09:59.320 --> 10:00.140
See, this is the kind of thing

10:00.240 --> 10:01.540
you'll have to keep an eye on.

10:01.640 --> 10:02.420
What about Dad?

10:02.520 --> 10:04.660
Well, I'd ask, but he's
clearly already sanctioned

10:04.760 --> 10:07.660
this monstrosity, so... (laughs)

10:07.760 --> 10:10.740
This is where you make a
disparaging yet affectionate remark

10:10.840 --> 10:13.340
about one of the three women in your life.

10:13.440 --> 10:15.440
I'm trying.

10:18.440 --> 10:21.060
(Jeremy crying)

10:21.160 --> 10:22.700
Joey, we can't do this.

10:22.800 --> 10:26.020
We can't pretend everything's
fine when it's not.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.860
Okay, but I don't wanna
spend whatever time...

10:28.960 --> 10:30.620
I'm sorry.

10:30.720 --> 10:35.720
Oh.

10:36.360 --> 10:38.640
Joe, be honest, how do
you wanna spend this time?

10:40.480 --> 10:42.480
Talking to you.

10:46.160 --> 10:48.160
I'm scared.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.200
Me too.

11:09.000 --> 11:11.800
There's a reason people
say you fall in love.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.840
It's not something you choose,

11:17.160 --> 11:19.160
it's something that happens to you.

11:21.360 --> 11:24.760
It's not a choice, it's a fall.

11:26.080 --> 11:28.080
That's why sometimes it hurts.

11:30.480 --> 11:32.480
That's what happened to me.

11:33.240 --> 11:35.240
I fell.

11:36.360 --> 11:38.360
It was an accident.

11:38.840 --> 11:43.840
(audience applauding)
(gentle thoughtful music)

12:01.080 --> 12:04.460
(people chattering)

12:04.560 --> 12:07.760
(upbeat dance music)

12:09.160 --> 12:10.820
Hey.

12:10.920 --> 12:11.980
Hey.

12:12.080 --> 12:13.940
Hi. I'm Dee, we spoke on the phone.

12:14.040 --> 12:14.780
Hi, it's so nice to meet you.

12:14.880 --> 12:16.460
Hi, nice to meet you. Congratulations.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.560
[Emma] Thank you so much. Thank you.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.660
Anyway, I, am gonna make an exit,

12:22.760 --> 12:24.300
so subtle and surreptitious you-

12:24.400 --> 12:25.140
Dee.

12:25.240 --> 12:27.240
Yeah.

12:31.440 --> 12:32.620
Everyone's saying how great you were.

12:32.720 --> 12:34.300
Thanks.

12:34.400 --> 12:38.460
Though, the tickets were
free, and so is the bar, so...

12:38.560 --> 12:39.420
Who knows right?

12:39.520 --> 12:41.920
(Ben laughs)

12:43.880 --> 12:45.880
Joey would've been proud.

12:46.280 --> 12:47.020
She would've been bored

12:47.120 --> 12:48.900
and wondered where the
songs were, but thank you.

12:49.000 --> 12:52.100
(laughs) I think I would've liked her.

12:52.200 --> 12:54.200
I know she would've liked you.

12:58.560 --> 12:59.300
I don't know why,

12:59.400 --> 13:01.720
but I've been thinking
about her all day today.

13:02.600 --> 13:07.620
(gentle thoughtful music)
(people chattering)

13:07.720 --> 13:09.300
Jack was the first one to walk.

13:09.400 --> 13:12.260
And I remember watching
this tiny little thing

13:12.360 --> 13:16.840
take his first steps, and I was so happy.

13:18.440 --> 13:19.740
For about half a second.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.320
And then I thought, "She's
never gonna see this."

13:24.320 --> 13:25.200
And then I started thinking about

13:25.200 --> 13:27.620
all the other things
she was never gonna see,

13:27.720 --> 13:29.720
and I just burst into tears.

13:31.280 --> 13:35.120
I walked off stage tonight,
and everyone was so happy,

13:36.840 --> 13:39.500
and all I could think
was, "I miss my sister."

13:39.600 --> 13:43.920
(gentle thoughtful music continues)

13:53.440 --> 13:55.300
Right.

13:55.400 --> 13:57.820
Better let you get back to your party.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.140
It's work, actually.

13:59.240 --> 14:02.760
(chuckles) Okay. Right.

14:10.440 --> 14:13.200
(door clunking)

14:20.680 --> 14:22.680
Who's Emma?

14:23.000 --> 14:25.040
Jack and Poppy were talking about her.

14:29.840 --> 14:30.580
She's, um-

14:30.680 --> 14:33.940
She's, um, the reason
I've done more babysitting

14:34.040 --> 14:36.840
in the last six weeks than I
have in the last six years.

14:39.280 --> 14:41.280
Yeah.

14:42.760 --> 14:44.760
She was.

14:46.400 --> 14:48.900
She's in the play that me and
Dee have just seen tonight.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.500
What was she like?

14:50.600 --> 14:51.980
[Ben] What, in the play?

14:52.080 --> 14:53.220
Never seen a play in me life, Ben,

14:53.320 --> 14:54.660
I'm hardly gonna take an interest now.

14:54.760 --> 14:57.320
(Ben chuckles)

15:00.560 --> 15:02.560
She was nice.

15:03.720 --> 15:08.720
Was she someone nice or
was she someone special?

15:10.880 --> 15:12.620
She was someone special.

15:12.720 --> 15:14.720
Were you in love with her?

15:17.640 --> 15:19.420
Oh, no what happened? Was it...

15:19.520 --> 15:20.380
What was it? The kids?

15:20.480 --> 15:21.580
Was it Jess?

15:21.680 --> 15:22.980
Mum, I don't wanna
talk about Jess tonight.

15:23.080 --> 15:26.760
(sighs) I just

15:27.960 --> 15:28.940
- feel like-
- Mum!

15:29.040 --> 15:31.040
Let me finish.

15:33.120 --> 15:35.140
You do know that it's possible

15:35.240 --> 15:36.980
to love more than one person in your life.

15:37.080 --> 15:37.820
Can you just-

15:37.920 --> 15:39.920
- Let me finish.
- Look, Mum!

15:41.040 --> 15:43.040
Okay.

15:45.840 --> 15:47.700
No, actually, I am gonna
say one more thing.

15:47.800 --> 15:48.540
Please don't.

15:48.640 --> 15:52.660
I love you, and I know
I have been pushing you,

15:52.760 --> 15:56.740
but I can see now that you're
not ready and that is fine.

15:56.840 --> 15:59.440
And if you are never ready, that's fine.

16:00.680 --> 16:02.220
All I want is for you to be happy,

16:02.320 --> 16:04.860
and if you want it to just be you and me

16:04.960 --> 16:07.160
and the kids forever,
then that's what we'll do.

16:39.480 --> 16:42.960
(tense thoughtful music)

16:56.640 --> 17:00.560
(cell phone keyboard clicking)

17:08.720 --> 17:09.580
[Josh] Hi, this is Josh.

17:09.680 --> 17:10.800
Please, leave your message after the tone,

17:10.800 --> 17:12.880
and I'll get back to you.

17:22.280 --> 17:24.280
Darling.

17:25.080 --> 17:27.080
It's your turn.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.200
Right.

17:35.200 --> 17:37.760
(Hannah sighs)

17:44.200 --> 17:47.360
(gentle sombre music)

17:50.760 --> 17:52.760
Yo.

18:03.680 --> 18:06.320
I was just outside trying
to think of what to say.

18:08.240 --> 18:10.740
I didn't know whether to say sorry

18:10.840 --> 18:13.600
for any time I ever hurt
you or made you cry.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.520
Because I am.

18:18.080 --> 18:20.080
I'm so sorry.

18:22.920 --> 18:24.920
Or to say thank you.

18:27.120 --> 18:29.120
For playing with me.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.420
For growing up with me.

18:32.520 --> 18:36.200
Or just to say, I love you, because I do.

18:37.240 --> 18:39.940
I love you more than anyone I've ever met,

18:40.040 --> 18:43.380
and I'm gonna miss you.

18:43.480 --> 18:48.480
Gonna miss talking to you.

18:50.800 --> 18:53.400
(Emma sobbing)

18:59.760 --> 19:01.760
I'm gonna need a minute.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.820
(Emma sniffling)

19:09.920 --> 19:12.340
(Emma exhales)

19:12.440 --> 19:15.200
(Emma sniffling)

19:16.760 --> 19:20.080
(sighs) Okay. What else do I wanna say?

19:25.360 --> 19:27.360
Mum!

19:28.120 --> 19:29.780
Mum!

19:29.880 --> 19:31.100
(door clunking)

19:31.200 --> 19:33.200
All right.

19:33.880 --> 19:35.880
All right.

19:38.800 --> 19:40.800
Joey.

19:43.560 --> 19:46.340
(Hannah light gasps)

19:46.440 --> 19:49.040
(Emma sobbing)

19:51.120 --> 19:53.120
All right.

19:54.720 --> 19:56.720
All right.

19:57.520 --> 19:59.680
I don't know what to do.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.720
(both crying)

20:07.360 --> 20:10.920
(gentle thoughtful music)

20:22.600 --> 20:25.020
Hi.

20:25.120 --> 20:27.120
Hi.

20:28.920 --> 20:31.520
(Harry laughs)

20:54.560 --> 20:56.560
Get me out of here.

21:07.480 --> 21:09.860
I didn't expect you back until next week.

21:09.960 --> 21:11.420
I wanted to surprise you.

21:11.520 --> 21:14.100
But the flight was delayed twice!

21:14.200 --> 21:15.700
I'm sorry I missed it.

21:15.800 --> 21:16.500
It's okay,

21:16.600 --> 21:19.020
I didn't expect you to
be here, anyway. (laughs)

21:19.120 --> 21:21.340
You'll be glad to hear my
trip to New York wasn't wasted.

21:21.440 --> 21:24.760
I mean, work was great, but
I'll tell you about that later

21:25.640 --> 21:27.880
'cause I know you're only
interested in one thing.

21:29.640 --> 21:34.640
(gentle mysterious music)
(birds chirping)

21:49.640 --> 21:51.840
Look, I don't know if you want to...

21:55.240 --> 21:57.240
Are you sure about this?

22:01.720 --> 22:06.480
So, I spoke to Grandma and
she, unsurprisingly, said yes.

22:09.080 --> 22:13.060
(upbeat R&B music)
(people chattering)

22:13.160 --> 22:16.000
She wants you to have it. (chuckles)

22:19.800 --> 22:23.840
I can't wait to marry you.

22:28.880 --> 22:33.880
(light thoughtful pop music)
(singer vocalising)

23:02.120 --> 23:05.280
(gentle peppy music)
