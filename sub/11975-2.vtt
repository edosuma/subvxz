WEBVTT

00:09.033 --> 00:11.833
- Hey, Mom.
- This is so great.

00:11.833 --> 00:14.467
Lamar's recovery has
been a miracle.

00:14.467 --> 00:17.200
He is now getting out of the
hospital and he is able to move

00:17.200 --> 00:19.767
- into his own home.
- This is such a great

00:19.767 --> 00:23.667
space.
These texts I got from Caitlyn--

00:23.667 --> 00:26.200
she tells me to get a life and
to shut up.

00:26.200 --> 00:28.200
I'm like, "You shut up and you
get a  life."

00:28.200 --> 00:30.600
You don't go on
and call me a

00:30.600 --> 00:33.067
- liar.
- You were her dad since

00:33.067 --> 00:36.600
she was five years old.
Tell me about you.

00:36.600 --> 00:39.100
I'm a 32-year-old man
that lives alone.

00:39.100 --> 00:41.633
- We'll see where things go.
- Where's Scott?

00:41.633 --> 00:44.367
Scott and Tyga have
been hanging out at his house.

00:44.367 --> 00:52.567
All day and night.♪ ♪

00:52.567 --> 00:56.133
It pisses me off that people
like Tyga, who should know

00:56.133 --> 01:01.233
better, that are close to our
family, that don't just, like,

01:01.233 --> 01:06.133
find some other friends.
It's not like Kanye's calling

01:06.133 --> 01:08.867
him and saying, "Come to the
studio every night, come to my

01:08.867 --> 01:12.933
show," you know?
It's Tyga calling him to hang

01:12.933 --> 01:15.267
- out and go to parties.
- Yeah.

01:15.267 --> 01:18.167
I think Kourtney has to
accept the fact that it's really

01:18.167 --> 01:21.867
Scott that she should be mad at,
and she can't keep putting the

01:21.867 --> 01:25.567
- blame on other people.
- So it just... it

01:25.567 --> 01:29.533
- still bothers me.
- Yeah.

01:29.533 --> 01:34.400
You guys, Baby Yeezys
are gonna be launched in August.

01:34.400 --> 01:37.767
The black ones and the, like,
original blue and cream mix.

01:37.767 --> 01:39.767
And so I was like, "Well, have
you guys thought about pink?"

01:39.767 --> 01:41.800
I think pink would be
so cute.

01:41.800 --> 01:44.133
"You guys are gonna be
wearing them all in the show?

01:44.133 --> 01:48.067
The new ones in the show?"
Kanye is having his Yeezy season

01:48.067 --> 01:51.233
three fashion show at Madison
Square Garden.

01:51.233 --> 01:54.267
Kanye really wants the whole
family there, and I do, too.

01:54.267 --> 01:56.867
And I think it's really cool
that he's opening up a fashion

01:56.867 --> 02:00.300
show to the public, which has
never been done before.

02:00.300 --> 02:03.400
So I can't wait for all of us to
go and just have a good time.

02:03.400 --> 02:05.600
I was thinking about
getting a private plane on

02:05.600 --> 02:07.633
- Monday morning.
- I'm going with Kim

02:07.633 --> 02:09.967
- on Tuesday.
- Honey, we got a plane.

02:29.033 --> 02:31.933
Hello?

02:31.933 --> 02:35.433
Lamar.
Hold on. You want to say hi to

02:35.433 --> 02:38.800
- Kylie and Kourt?
- Hi, Lam.

02:38.800 --> 02:41.533
- Hey, Kourt.
- Miss you.

02:41.533 --> 02:44.967
- Miss you, too.
- How was therapy today?

02:44.967 --> 02:47.167
It was good.
I ran on the treadmill for ten

02:47.167 --> 02:49.500
- minutes today.
- No, you didn't.

02:49.500 --> 02:52.400
- Yes, I did.
- That's so good.

02:52.400 --> 02:55.733
Lamar, that's awesome.
Congratulations.

02:55.733 --> 02:58.467
Lamar is constantly progressing,
getting better.

02:58.467 --> 03:01.000
I'm so, so proud of him.
I mean, I know a lot of this

03:01.000 --> 03:03.167
stuff is probably really
frustrating for Lamar, but it

03:03.167 --> 03:06.133
just takes time.
And I am a full believer in his

03:06.133 --> 03:09.700
- ability to fully recover.
- All right.

03:09.700 --> 03:11.700
Okay. I'll talk to you
later.

03:11.700 --> 03:13.900
Bye-bye.
- Bye.

03:13.900 --> 03:17.133
That's crazy.
Right, Kylie?

03:17.133 --> 03:19.467
- Hold on.
- Oh...

03:19.467 --> 03:22.133
Don't be
scared.

03:22.133 --> 03:29.833
Oh...♪ ♪

03:29.833 --> 03:32.400
What are you doing in

03:32.400 --> 03:34.600
- here?
- Ooh, the leopard.

03:34.600 --> 03:38.067
The leo-pard.
We are, like, in the same color

03:38.067 --> 03:40.533
- tones.
- Uh, it's called black.

03:40.533 --> 03:42.533
- There's no tone.
- And... No, your brown

03:42.533 --> 03:45.267
- boots.
- Oh! Yes, Gina!

03:45.267 --> 03:48.067
- Yes.
- Mmm. What's going on?

03:48.067 --> 03:50.767
Nothing. Just getting
ready and packing for New York.

03:50.767 --> 03:52.767
You're gonna need that
jacket there.

03:52.767 --> 03:54.767
At... Like, I wasn't
prepared to really leave the

03:54.767 --> 03:56.800
- house just yet.
Mm-hmm.

03:56.800 --> 03:58.933
And I don't really want
to be seen.

03:58.933 --> 04:02.333
But I feel like all the coats
will cover me.

04:02.333 --> 04:04.500
- The coats.
- And it's all about just,

04:04.500 --> 04:06.500
- like, hiding under coats.
- I mean, you're really

04:06.500 --> 04:08.500
not that big.
How exciting about the show

04:08.500 --> 04:10.500
- though.
- I'm so excited.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.500
It's supposed to be so good.
It's at Madison Square Garden.

04:12.500 --> 04:14.833
- So crazy.
- Yeah, you have to come.

04:14.833 --> 04:17.800
What am I gonna do,
just, like, come and, like,

04:17.800 --> 04:20.567
leave Lam?
Kocktails...

04:20.567 --> 04:23.533
No. Like, bring him.
I can't

04:23.533 --> 04:27.267
just, like, bring Lamar to New
York.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.867
- Why not?
- Like, he has not been

04:30.867 --> 04:33.333
in public yet.
He hasn't been on a plane or

04:33.333 --> 04:36.300
been around people.
Like, it's just... way more

04:36.300 --> 04:41.133
anxiety for me, I think, than
for anybody else.

04:41.133 --> 04:44.333
Lamar has not traveled since his
accident.

04:44.333 --> 04:46.567
Lamar has not been to New York
in years.

04:46.567 --> 04:49.467
New York is a very negative
place for Lamar.

04:49.467 --> 04:53.400
I am just flooded with anxiety.
It's a lot.

04:53.400 --> 04:56.000
When I was sitting there
with him at his house, he was

04:56.000 --> 05:00.133
like, "Honestly, like, Kanye's
music, like, helped me so much.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.733
Like, that's when I realized,
like, okay, I could start, like,

05:02.733 --> 05:05.500
thinking again and things were
coming back to me and I could

05:05.500 --> 05:10.567
start, like, articulating it."
He loves that.

05:10.567 --> 05:13.700
He's always like, "Ah, Kanye
saved me."

05:13.700 --> 05:17.100
That's so sweet.
There was a moment when Lamar

05:17.100 --> 05:20.733
couldn't really express himself
and he couldn't really talk, but

05:20.733 --> 05:23.033
he could hear what we were
saying to him.

05:23.033 --> 05:26.367
And Kanye really felt, like, we
can cure him through music,

05:26.367 --> 05:28.900
like, we can get him to talk.
And he would go to the hospital

05:28.900 --> 05:31.200
and he would, like, rap and
sing.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.767
And I think Lamar started to get
his, like, function back and

05:33.767 --> 05:36.700
started to talk, once he started
to listen to a lot of music.

05:36.700 --> 05:42.133
You're doing so well.
Good job.

05:42.133 --> 05:44.433
I think Lamar wants to
go and support Kanye, and this

05:44.433 --> 05:49.233
will be just such a-a powerful
moment for them, I think.

05:49.233 --> 05:51.500
But, like, what's the plan?
Like, shouldn't he get out at

05:51.500 --> 05:53.700
- some point?
- No. I mean, I'm doing

05:53.700 --> 05:55.500
'cause I wasn't
planning on going.

05:55.500 --> 05:59.067
Well, see if he even
wants to go.

06:06.867 --> 06:09.133
How's your app going
and stuff?

06:09.133 --> 06:13.600
- Good, I think.
- How's Scott?

06:13.600 --> 06:16.300
I don't think he's
been okay lately.

06:16.300 --> 06:19.700
After his hanging out with Tyga
and all that.

06:19.700 --> 06:24.700
So, I almost want to, like, call
Tyga and just literally go off

06:24.700 --> 06:27.900
on him.
Like, I have a tendency to,

06:27.900 --> 06:32.567
like, shift some blame from,
like, Scott onto the people that

06:32.567 --> 06:35.967
are around him, to where, like,
I'm never be able to be cool

06:35.967 --> 06:39.333
with you again.
So...

06:39.333 --> 06:44.500
I mean... I don't know
about going off on him, 'cause

06:44.500 --> 06:48.133
he's really sensitive.
I know Kourtney kind of gets mad

06:48.133 --> 06:51.867
at Tyga sometimes.
But Tyga always feels like he's

06:51.867 --> 06:55.667
in the middle of Scott and
Kourtney.

06:55.667 --> 06:58.000
I think I should
just say, like, "Do you ever

06:58.000 --> 07:01.567
think about how your actions,
like, affect other people?

07:01.567 --> 07:11.833
Like, stop being so selfish."♪ ♪

07:11.833 --> 07:15.233
What's up?
Please, please, I like my toes

07:15.233 --> 07:17.233
- licked but not by dogs.
- I hate when she does

07:17.233 --> 07:19.233
- that, too!
- You want to like it,

07:19.233 --> 07:21.233
but you're like, "You're a dog.
Ugh."

07:21.233 --> 07:23.233
No, because she has a
soft tongue, too.

07:23.233 --> 07:25.233
Babe, you got a good
tongue.

07:25.233 --> 07:27.233
I'm just sayin'.

07:27.233 --> 07:29.233
I think you should get Lamar a
dog.

07:29.233 --> 07:31.233
- Not a puppy.
- No, no, no. He

07:31.233 --> 07:33.400
doesn't need to take care of
anything.

07:33.400 --> 07:35.833
It just needs to be, like, a
companion.

07:35.833 --> 07:39.100
So obviously Kanye's
fashion show is, like, known,

07:39.100 --> 07:41.100
and the whole family keeps
talking about it and talking

07:41.100 --> 07:43.100
about it.
And I was never planning on

07:43.100 --> 07:45.100
- going.
- Who's gonna watch

07:45.100 --> 07:47.100
- Lamar?
- Exactly.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.133
So then Kim was like, "Well, why
don't you bring Lamar?"

07:49.133 --> 07:52.433
And I was like, "Bring Lamar?"
Like... And, mind you, I just

07:52.433 --> 07:56.500
found out that it's for, like,
14,000 people.

07:56.500 --> 07:59.200
It's just a lot to handle no
matter what.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.633
It is very natural
for you to be protective.

08:01.633 --> 08:05.600
You should be, but you also have
to let the reins go a little

08:05.600 --> 08:07.967
bit, to see how he's
progressing.

08:07.967 --> 08:10.100
You won't know that until you
try.

08:10.100 --> 08:13.000
Yeah, of course. But
Lamar's... It's like when you're

08:13.000 --> 08:15.300
starving and you go to a
restaurant, don't you order way

08:15.300 --> 08:17.800
more than you could eat?
His eyes are bigger than his

08:17.800 --> 08:20.100
stomach right now.
I'm just trying to protect him.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.333
I'm thinking on the
other side is think about what

08:22.333 --> 08:25.633
his life has been like.
He's been very secluded.

08:25.633 --> 08:28.833
I think it's time.
I actually agree with Kim.

08:28.833 --> 08:31.200
I am really
overprotective, and I know how

08:31.200 --> 08:33.800
much Lamar wants to go to New
York.

08:33.800 --> 08:35.967
But, still, I'm scared, 'cause
I don't know how Lamar's gonna

08:35.967 --> 08:38.867
handle this situation.
I really just have to decide

08:38.867 --> 08:47.567
what I think is best for Lam at
the end of the day.

08:47.567 --> 08:50.033
I want to ask him, "So how do
you feel about Caitlyn?"

08:50.033 --> 08:52.300
- Are you guys better?
- No. I haven't spoken

08:52.300 --> 08:54.633
to her.
After she said "you little piece

08:54.633 --> 08:57.967
of ,  you."
I wrote Kim days

08:57.967 --> 09:02.067
ago and said no Tyga, no Scott
at the show.

09:02.067 --> 09:04.567
- She invited both.
- Of course.

09:04.567 --> 09:07.200
I'm really just hoping that
there's no drama, because we're

09:07.200 --> 09:20.033
really there to support Kanye.
Whatever.

09:20.033 --> 09:22.800
- Hello.
- Hi.

09:22.800 --> 09:26.233
I've had, like, a headache since
the middle of the night last

09:26.233 --> 09:29.300
night.
It's really weird.

09:29.300 --> 09:33.133
Did you hear that Scott has an
appearance at 1 Oak in New York

09:33.133 --> 09:35.000
- while we're there?
- Yeah. So he called me

09:35.000 --> 09:38.433
because he wanted a ride on the
plane, so I was, like, "Yeah,

09:38.433 --> 09:41.200
for sure come," and then, like,
you know, I can maybe, like,

09:41.200 --> 09:44.300
hang out with him, keep an eye
on him, just, like, help him

09:44.300 --> 09:48.233
with, like, sobriety.
If we're hanging out, he's not

09:48.233 --> 09:50.233
- gonna, like, be wasted.
- Yeah.

09:50.233 --> 09:52.100
And I'm, like, we'll all
hang out and go to dinner when

09:52.100 --> 09:55.867
we land, and, like, be busy so
that he's not, you know, in,

09:55.867 --> 09:58.067
- like, party mode.
- Yeah.

09:58.067 --> 10:00.833
He did say he wanted to
go to the fashion show, so...

10:00.833 --> 10:03.433
- Oh, good.
- It was really important

10:03.433 --> 10:06.633
for us to invite Scott because I
want him to feel like if he

10:06.633 --> 10:09.300
needs to feel busy that it's
with us instead of partying and

10:09.300 --> 10:12.333
resorting back to maybe, like,
unhealthy behavior.

10:12.333 --> 10:14.233
So I'd want to just invite him
to all the things that we're

10:14.233 --> 10:16.233
doing.

10:16.233 --> 10:18.233
- Look that way.
- Oh.

10:18.233 --> 10:20.100
Maybe not your head at

10:20.100 --> 10:22.100
- that angle.
- Oh.

10:22.100 --> 10:23.933
No, you can be on your
phone.

10:23.933 --> 10:25.933
No, no, no, just like middle.
Yeah.

10:25.933 --> 10:27.867
What are we doing?

10:34.433 --> 10:36.467
Oh, I love these
hoops.

10:36.467 --> 10:38.467
- Are we kidding?
- I know.

10:38.467 --> 10:40.700
Finally.
Who do I have to blow to get

10:40.700 --> 10:44.767
- these earrings?
- I'll find out.

10:44.767 --> 10:47.167
Okay. "How are you?
I'm so excited."

10:47.167 --> 10:49.500
- Um...
- Are you starting to

10:49.500 --> 10:51.700
get nervous?
You are.

10:51.700 --> 10:53.733
Again. I am.
Is RuPaul coming?

10:53.733 --> 10:55.867
- Yeah.
- I want to ask him, "So

10:55.867 --> 10:58.967
how do you feel about Caitlyn?"
Are you guys better?

10:58.967 --> 11:00.967
No. I haven't spoken
to her.

11:00.967 --> 11:03.000
After she said, "You little
piece of.

11:03.000 --> 11:05.000
you."
Dah, dah, dah, dah. I was...

11:05.000 --> 11:07.833
And then she's like, "I think we
need to have a girl's dinner and

11:07.833 --> 11:10.200
have a little hug."
I'm like, "Nuh-uh."

11:10.200 --> 11:12.800
It really...
Like, when you say you're sorry,

11:12.800 --> 11:14.800
it actually is a sign of
strength.

11:14.800 --> 11:19.100
It's not a weakness.
You could just say "I'm sorry."

11:19.100 --> 11:23.167
Caitlyn is upset with me because
of my Howard Stern interview

11:23.167 --> 11:27.167
which I sincerely don't
understand what I did wrong.

11:27.167 --> 11:30.000
All I ever said was the truth,
and the truth is that Caitlyn

11:30.000 --> 11:32.000
was never fully honest about her
transitioning.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.933
End of story.
I just have so much going on in

11:33.933 --> 11:35.767
my life right now, and I just
don't...

11:35.767 --> 11:37.700
I don't need to deal with this.

11:37.700 --> 11:39.533
- Come in.
- We're ready to go to

11:39.533 --> 11:41.533
- set.
- I'm ready.

11:41.533 --> 11:43.567
And we're walking.

11:43.567 --> 11:46.600
And we're walking.
Hello.

12:08.367 --> 12:12.200
- Let me see, Kourt.
- Have a look, please.

12:12.200 --> 12:13.900
- Have a look...
- Yeah.

12:13.900 --> 12:17.100
Oh, my!
my!

12:17.100 --> 12:19.100
Hey. Hey.

12:19.100 --> 12:21.100
- Look at my crew.
- Hey.

12:21.100 --> 12:25.833
- Come on, I need a picture.
- It's... Hey!

12:25.833 --> 12:29.167
- Yeah, here we go.
- Caitlyn just got to New

12:29.167 --> 12:32.367
York, and she's in her fitting,
and it's really exciting.

12:32.367 --> 12:34.733
I just really hope that Khloe
and Lamar can come.

12:34.733 --> 12:36.733
Kanye and I both really want
them to be a part of this.

12:36.733 --> 12:38.733
Kourtney, come here,
come here, come here.

12:38.733 --> 12:40.733
- Come on, Kourt.
- Kourtney, I made that

12:40.733 --> 12:42.733
- for you.
- Yes!

12:42.733 --> 12:44.567
Well, but it's coming
home with me.

12:44.567 --> 12:46.567
You can borrow it.

12:46.567 --> 12:48.400
This is the first time that

12:48.400 --> 12:51.733
Kanye is really dressing the
whole family, and Olivier from

12:51.733 --> 12:54.833
Balmain collaborated and made
these pieces that...

12:54.833 --> 12:57.733
They're like one-of-a-kinds.
And I think it's, like, so cool

12:57.733 --> 13:01.700
that they put so much work into
really getting looks for every

13:01.700 --> 13:06.467
single family member.
This one's the best one.

13:06.467 --> 13:08.367
Okay, that's cool.
Let her change...

13:08.367 --> 13:11.300
- Yo, yo... yo, get...
- Yeah, but I deserve

13:11.300 --> 13:13.133
- it... I deserve it.
- You deserve it 'cause

13:13.133 --> 13:15.767
you went to design school.
Let's photograph this next look.

13:15.767 --> 13:19.133
I don't want to show my

13:19.133 --> 13:23.100
knees.
So I just gave birth a few

13:23.100 --> 13:27.867
months ago to Saint, and I'm not
really ready to go out in public

13:27.867 --> 13:30.433
yet, 'cause there's always so
much pressure under the public

13:30.433 --> 13:34.233
eye, but I would never miss
Kanye's show for the world.

13:34.233 --> 13:37.800
I'm so excited for the show.

13:37.800 --> 13:41.333
Who knew you'd be so helpful for
me in life.

13:41.333 --> 13:44.233
Got to take care of
each other.

13:44.233 --> 13:46.233
I never thought in a

13:46.233 --> 13:48.800
- million years...
- You'll like that

13:48.800 --> 13:50.733
- one.
- ...that I'd be sharing

13:50.733 --> 14:06.933
makeup with Cait.

14:06.933 --> 14:08.933
- You look pretty.
- Thanks, babe.

14:08.933 --> 14:10.933
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.967
Hi, sweetie.
How are you? Hi.

14:12.967 --> 14:14.967
- Well, hi.
- Hi.

14:14.967 --> 14:16.667
- What's going on?
- How are you?

14:16.667 --> 14:18.667
- Okay.
- Great.

14:18.667 --> 14:20.333
Well, I haven't been
to the house in a while, and

14:20.333 --> 14:22.167
you've done a nice job with
everything.

14:22.167 --> 14:24.167
- With my house?
- Yeah.

14:24.167 --> 14:26.167
Oh, oh, oh.
Where's Scott?

14:26.167 --> 14:28.167
- He's here.
- Where?

14:28.167 --> 14:30.967
- He's at the hotel.
- Doing what?

14:30.967 --> 14:33.967
Hanging out.
Kim has invited him to every

14:33.967 --> 14:35.867
single thing.
She's, like, "Do you want to

14:35.867 --> 14:37.867
come to the album thing?
Do you want to...?"

14:37.867 --> 14:40.333
I already t...
I wrote Kim days ago and said,

14:40.333 --> 14:44.067
"No Tyga, no Scott at the show."
She invited both.

14:44.067 --> 14:46.067
Of course.

14:46.067 --> 14:48.933
But Kim's like,

14:48.933 --> 14:51.767
"What do you care?
Just invite Scott to stuff if

14:51.767 --> 14:55.067
it's gonna, like, keep him out
of trouble.

14:55.067 --> 14:59.567
Better him hanging out with all
of us than... whatever."

14:59.567 --> 15:01.567
There's no rhyme or
reason at this point.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.600
- Yeah.
- If he wants to be

15:03.600 --> 15:06.567
- in trouble, he will be.
- Exactly.

15:06.567 --> 15:10.033
Kim may have the best
intentions, but that doesn't

15:10.033 --> 15:12.400
mean that it's going to go the
way that she's thinking it's

15:12.400 --> 15:15.167
gonna go.
So, I'm really just hoping that

15:15.167 --> 15:19.233
there's no drama, because we're
really there to support Kanye.

15:19.233 --> 15:21.233
You want to go to
the bathroom?

15:21.233 --> 15:23.233
- I think I'm good.
- Okay.

15:23.233 --> 15:25.067
I have to go to the
bathroom.

15:25.067 --> 15:27.067
Let's go.

15:27.067 --> 15:28.700
You guys know that I've
peed in the Delano lobby.

15:28.700 --> 15:30.533
- When?
- I've heard this story a

15:30.533 --> 15:32.367
million times, and I wouldn't
keep repeating it.

15:32.367 --> 15:36.033
And I peed in my BMW
'cause I had seven ice teas.

15:36.033 --> 15:46.267
No wonder you couldn't
sell it.

15:46.267 --> 15:49.800
How was therapy today?

15:49.800 --> 15:52.133
- Good.
- You're just chilling,

15:52.133 --> 15:54.133
right?
You're...

15:54.133 --> 15:56.133
You don't have anxiety.
Only I do.

15:56.133 --> 16:02.100
Great.
I've decided to go to New York

16:02.100 --> 16:04.067
with Lamar 'cause I think this
is something he truly wants to

16:04.067 --> 16:05.900
do, and I just...
At the end of the day, I want

16:05.900 --> 16:08.333
Lamar to be happy.
I still feel a ton of anxiety

16:08.333 --> 16:11.933
and pressure, but if this makes
him happy, and if I can keep him

16:11.933 --> 16:14.733
safe, then that's a match made
in heaven.

16:14.733 --> 16:16.733
Just relax.
I got the perfect outfit.

16:16.733 --> 16:18.567
I've got it custom-made for you,
okay?

16:18.567 --> 16:20.567
- Thank you.
- Okay, relax. Calm down.

16:20.567 --> 16:22.567
- He said thank you.
- Have fun.

16:22.567 --> 16:24.567
- Okay. I got to go.
- Okay. Love you. Bye.

16:24.567 --> 16:26.567
- Bye.
- I'm nervous.

16:26.567 --> 16:29.900
Like, this is nerve-racking.
You haven't been in public ever.

16:29.900 --> 16:33.167
I have more anxiety than you do,
I'm sure, but it's because I

16:33.167 --> 16:35.300
- don't think you understand.
- I can understand.

16:35.300 --> 16:37.867
I know.
I know you want to go, and I

16:37.867 --> 16:40.767
know all that, but it's a lot.
That's all I'm saying.

16:49.900 --> 16:52.133
Oh, God, I miss being in
New York.

16:52.133 --> 16:54.133
Knock, knock.

16:54.133 --> 16:56.133
- Whew! Look at that!
- You know La La.

16:56.133 --> 16:58.133
Oh, yes.
How are you doing?

16:58.133 --> 17:00.033
- Oh, hi!
- Good to see you.

17:00.033 --> 17:01.867
- How are you?
- It's so nice to see

17:01.867 --> 17:03.700
- you.
- Nice to see you.

17:03.700 --> 17:05.533
- Hey, baby.
- Hi. It is hot in here.

17:05.533 --> 17:07.200
Well, after
Christmas, it's so good that

17:07.200 --> 17:08.867
you're here in New York so you
have all these coats you can

17:08.867 --> 17:10.700
- actually wear.
- I know. I know.

17:10.700 --> 17:12.533
That's what...
Well, I was just telling La La.

17:12.533 --> 17:15.267
She asked where I got this, and
I was like, "One of my Christmas

17:15.267 --> 17:17.300
presents."
Yeah.

17:17.300 --> 17:19.133
- You look nice.
- Well, thank you.

17:19.133 --> 17:21.367
- How's the show coming along?
- Really good, really

17:21.367 --> 17:24.567
hectic.
Lamar's coming into town.

17:24.567 --> 17:26.500
- Right.
- Isn't that exciting?

17:26.500 --> 17:28.367
Extraordinarily
exciting.

17:28.367 --> 17:30.200
Her husband played with
him for years.

17:30.200 --> 17:32.200
- Yeah, right.
- Yeah, he was...

17:32.200 --> 17:34.267
So he saw something on
the news about you, and he was a

17:34.267 --> 17:36.267
little confused, so I had to,
like, explain it to him.

17:36.267 --> 17:38.133
- Yeah.
- And I was like, "Well,

17:38.133 --> 17:40.067
it's Caitlyn now," and he was
like, "What?!"

17:40.067 --> 17:41.900
I know Khloe tried
to explain it to him a couple of

17:41.900 --> 17:44.200
times, but at that point, I
don't think he was getting

17:44.200 --> 17:46.200
- anything.
- Yeah.

17:46.200 --> 17:48.700
- Have you talked to Khloe at all?
- She hasn't been

17:48.700 --> 17:51.367
- talking to me lately.
- I know. I was gonna say,

17:51.367 --> 17:53.267
didn't you guys get into a big
fight?

17:53.267 --> 17:56.200
- I know. Yeah.
- This is a really big

17:56.200 --> 17:58.467
week.
Lamar's already dealing with the

17:58.467 --> 18:00.567
pressure of being in an
environment where there's a lot

18:00.567 --> 18:03.300
of people.
And this is, you know... it

18:03.300 --> 18:05.600
might be really difficult for
him.

18:05.600 --> 18:08.133
And Khloe and Caitlyn are kind
of on the outs.

18:08.133 --> 18:11.600
So everyone has to put our
differences aside for this week

18:11.600 --> 18:15.100
- and just be cool.
- She called me a liar

18:15.100 --> 18:18.733
with Howard Stern.
I didn't lie to anybody.

18:18.733 --> 18:22.167
I-I hope Khloe will spend some
time with me.

18:22.167 --> 18:24.533
She didn't reach out to me at
all at that time either.

18:24.533 --> 18:27.133
Yeah. And she has a big
hang-up that she's the kid, so

18:27.133 --> 18:30.067
the adults should reach out to
the kid.

18:30.067 --> 18:32.733
You're the one transitioning, so
you should have reached out to

18:32.733 --> 18:35.767
her.
It's just how she feels.

18:35.767 --> 18:39.500
I just hope that Caitlyn and
Khloe get a chance to move past

18:39.500 --> 18:43.767
the drama, because otherwise it
could just be a disaster.

18:43.767 --> 18:46.833
It's not wrong or right, but I
just think that, like, at some

18:46.833 --> 18:49.733
point, talk to Khloe.

18:52.100 --> 18:55.500
Lam is really nervous
about meeting Caitlyn.

18:55.500 --> 18:58.500
Well, I had a whole talk
with Caitlyn yesterday about it.

18:58.500 --> 19:02.767
You have to, like, take it in
baby steps.

19:02.767 --> 19:05.800
Kourtney got, like,
ambushed by Tyga and, like, five

19:05.800 --> 19:08.700
other men and were like, "I hope
there's not beef."

19:08.700 --> 19:10.700
And Kourtney's like, "No, we're
fine.

19:10.700 --> 19:12.600
We're not fine."

19:22.767 --> 19:26.600
- Hey!
- Where were you guys

19:26.600 --> 19:28.600
- today?
- Kourtney, can I say?

19:28.600 --> 19:30.633
- Yeah.
- Kourtney got, like,

19:30.633 --> 19:32.633
ambushed by Tyga and, like, five
other men who came around her

19:32.633 --> 19:34.633
and were like, "I hope there's
not beef."

19:34.633 --> 19:36.633
And Kourtney was like, "No,
we're fine.

19:36.633 --> 19:38.633
We're not fine, but we are
fine."

19:38.633 --> 19:40.633
Wait, I didn't
know.

19:40.633 --> 19:42.633
Is there something...
What's the beef?

19:42.633 --> 19:44.300
Tyga's been hanging
out with Scott.

19:44.300 --> 19:45.700
They've been going to clubs
together.

19:45.700 --> 19:47.700
- Hi.
- Yeah. Hi!

19:47.700 --> 19:50.067
- Hollywood.
- Why Hollywood?

19:50.067 --> 19:52.067
What did you get to
drink?

19:52.067 --> 19:54.333
I don't know.
I might just have a beer.

19:54.333 --> 19:56.333
Whoa. It's that
time?

19:56.333 --> 20:01.500
- Thank you.
- Where's Scott?

20:01.500 --> 20:03.533
- At the hotel.
- Oh, why doesn't he

20:03.533 --> 20:05.533
- hang out?
- When is he staying

20:05.533 --> 20:07.533
till?
Tell me just so I know when the

20:07.533 --> 20:09.533
- misery ends.
- I don't know.

20:09.533 --> 20:11.533
Where'd he go last
night?

20:11.533 --> 20:14.567
I'm not sure.
He was writing me all night,

20:14.567 --> 20:17.067
like, "Can we watch a movie?
Can we hang out?"

20:17.067 --> 20:20.867
And he's like, "If I hang out
with you then I won't go out."

20:20.867 --> 20:23.467
Like, I can't... it can't be on
me.

20:23.467 --> 20:26.867
I can't live my life worried
that my actions could cause

20:26.867 --> 20:30.633
Scott to spiral.
I just really need to live my

20:30.633 --> 20:35.767
life for me and hope that he's
doing the best that he can do.

20:40.267 --> 20:42.700
- It's so good.
- Is it warm?

20:42.700 --> 20:44.700
- No, it's so good.
- Cheers.

20:44.700 --> 20:46.700
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

20:46.700 --> 20:48.700
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

20:48.700 --> 20:50.900
This is why my
voice is annoying.

20:50.900 --> 20:53.400
Because when I talk screaming
talk...

20:53.400 --> 20:57.300
"Yeah, guys! Like..."
Oh, my God.

20:57.300 --> 21:09.133
kills me.♪ ♪

21:09.133 --> 21:11.633
- Oh...
- Do you think people will

21:11.633 --> 21:14.600
- think I dyed my hair?
- All the white

21:14.600 --> 21:16.600
people will.
The black people will know.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.667
Kim.

21:18.667 --> 21:21.300
- Yeah?
- Uh, one thing, Lam is

21:21.300 --> 21:25.233
really nervous about meeting
Caitlyn.

21:25.233 --> 21:28.567
Well, I had a whole talk
with Caitlyn yesterday about it.

21:28.567 --> 21:30.567
- About Lam?
- And I was just like,

21:30.567 --> 21:32.967
"You know, you have to, like,
take it in baby steps."

But, you know, he might not be

21:37.667 --> 21:41.167

in the hospital...

33:42.133 --> 33:44.133
Uh-huh.
- ...in Vegas, we

33:44.133 --> 33:47.500
didn't think we would see you
again.

33:47.500 --> 33:50.500
Do you have, like, a new outlook
on life?

33:50.500 --> 33:59.100
That's a great
question, Kourt.

33:59.100 --> 34:01.867
So, Lamar, you
missed all the fun.

34:01.867 --> 34:05.267
- Like what?
- What?

34:05.267 --> 34:09.200
What's up?
We got to talk.

34:09.200 --> 34:12.700
All these months, and now we
finally get to see you again.

34:12.700 --> 34:14.000
Yeah, a lot's
happened.

34:14.000 --> 34:17.467
But I'm here.

34:17.467 --> 34:21.200
Honestly, I was
very emotional to see you there

34:21.200 --> 34:24.167
today.
Yeah.

34:24.167 --> 34:28.767
- All good stuff.
- Yep.

34:28.767 --> 34:30.833
Life is good, isn't
it?

34:30.833 --> 34:33.500
It's beautiful.
It's beautiful.

34:33.500 --> 34:35.500
- It beats the alternative.
Mm-hmm.

34:35.500 --> 34:40.100
Yeah.
I feel like a weight has been

34:40.100 --> 34:43.100
lifted off of my shoulders.
Lamar and Caitlyn met, and I

34:43.100 --> 34:45.867
mean, he was super mellow and
calm.

34:45.867 --> 34:48.433
I think I was way more nervous
than he was.

34:48.433 --> 34:51.733
Lamar handled everything
perfectly.

34:51.733 --> 34:54.933
So I want to tell you
guys something about Khloe and

34:54.933 --> 34:57.267
- Lamar's relationship.
- Oh, my God.

34:57.267 --> 34:59.267
So I was over--
Can you tell me first

34:59.267 --> 35:01.267
before you have to say it
publically?

35:01.267 --> 35:03.500
- No.
- It's beautiful.

35:03.500 --> 35:06.367
So I was over at the
house, and Khloe and Lamar were

35:06.367 --> 35:10.233
talking about conspiracy
theories, and I didn't realize--

35:10.233 --> 35:13.233
I knew Khloe, like, she thinks
there's mermaids and aliens and

35:13.233 --> 35:15.667
- all these wild things.
- There are.

35:15.667 --> 35:17.967
- And leprechauns.
- There are.

35:17.967 --> 35:20.267
- But so does he.
- Well, what's your

35:20.267 --> 35:22.433
- point, Mom? That was it?
- I just wanted to say

35:22.433 --> 35:24.433
that was adorable that you guys
connect on--

35:24.433 --> 35:26.467
And Corey was
teary-eyed over that?

35:26.467 --> 35:28.800
You guys, it's been

35:28.800 --> 35:32.067
magical, but I'm done. Yeah.
Hey.

35:32.067 --> 35:33.933
A long time since
the last time we talked.

35:33.933 --> 35:35.767
- Yes.
- A lot has...

35:35.767 --> 35:37.633
A lot of water's flown under the
bridge.

35:37.633 --> 35:39.633
- Bye, Cait.
- Yes.

35:39.633 --> 35:41.633
- Okay.
Bye-bye.

35:41.633 --> 35:43.467
Oh, finally get my
hug?

35:43.467 --> 35:45.300
Yeah, you get your hug
right now.

35:45.300 --> 35:46.967
- Okay, good. Good.
- Sea water under the

35:46.967 --> 35:48.900
- bridge, Cait.
- A lot of water.

35:48.900 --> 35:50.900
A lot of wond...
Well, whatever.

35:50.900 --> 35:55.400
At the end of the day, I'm
always going to love Caitlyn.

35:55.400 --> 36:00.167
We might not see eye to eye all
the time-- or any of the time--

36:00.167 --> 36:04.867
but I know Caitlyn loves me.
We're family.

36:04.867 --> 36:06.900
I think that's what family does
best.

36:06.900 --> 36:10.167
We go up and down, and...
But we are still always gonna be

36:10.167 --> 36:12.167
- there for one another.
- So happy to see you

36:12.167 --> 36:14.167
- there tonight.
- Thank you.

36:14.167 --> 36:15.800
It just like...
I was crying the whole time.

36:15.800 --> 36:20.567
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

36:24.133 --> 36:28.033
You know what's
crazy?

36:28.033 --> 36:30.300
Just, we were saying, can you
believe Lamar is here?

36:30.300 --> 36:32.833
When we left you in the hospital
in Vegas...

36:32.833 --> 36:36.400
Uh-huh.
- ...we didn't think

36:36.400 --> 36:42.300
we would see you again.
And we were hysterically crying

36:42.300 --> 36:46.800
on the airplane.
We couldn't even talk.

36:46.800 --> 36:48.800
Can you believe that from that
moment...

36:48.800 --> 36:50.867
- Till now.
- ...like, we've

36:50.867 --> 36:52.933
- gotten here...
Mm-hmm.

36:52.933 --> 36:56.067
...to where you're
at this huge Madison Square

36:56.067 --> 36:58.200
Garden with, like, 30,000
people?

36:58.200 --> 37:00.200
- Yeah.
- Like, screaming when

37:00.200 --> 37:02.300
you walked through the door,
too.

37:02.300 --> 37:04.300
- Yeah.
- That's major.

37:04.300 --> 37:06.300
I swear that
peoples' prayers for you...

37:06.300 --> 37:08.367
Mm-hmm.
- ...like saved your

37:08.367 --> 37:10.367
life.
Like, the world praying for

37:10.367 --> 37:12.367
- you...
Mm-hmm, yeah.

37:12.367 --> 37:14.467
- I agree.
- ...saved your life.

37:14.467 --> 37:17.400
Do you have, like, a new, like,
outlook on life?

37:17.400 --> 37:22.700
It's a great question,
Kourt.

37:22.700 --> 37:25.133
- Yeah.
- Do you appreciate

37:25.133 --> 37:27.600
- everything, you think?
- I do.

37:27.600 --> 37:30.067
Wait. But you never
had, like, a moment where you

37:30.067 --> 37:35.000
- saw heaven and stuff like that?
- No, I kept having real

37:35.000 --> 37:41.133
- dreams, in-depth dreams.
- With people you

37:41.133 --> 37:43.133
- know and stuff?
- Some people that have

37:43.133 --> 37:45.133
- passed on.
- Oh, really?

37:45.133 --> 37:47.067
I think he went to
heaven from the conversations he

37:47.067 --> 37:49.100
- has with me.
- Yeah.

37:49.100 --> 37:52.100
And since they told me
he was basically dead.

37:52.100 --> 37:56.200
I don't remember
bumping into Jesus, but...

37:56.200 --> 37:58.467
Maybe those people
were just with you.

37:58.467 --> 38:00.467
- That's what it is.
- Telling you it's not

38:00.467 --> 38:04.133
- your time.
- Yeah.

38:04.133 --> 38:06.133
- Telling you to stay.
- Talking to you

38:06.133 --> 38:20.500
- and...
- That's what it is.

38:20.500 --> 38:23.000
It's so peaceful
in here, I could fall asleep.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.967
This lighting is amazing.
I'm literally, like...

38:25.967 --> 38:28.067
Ugh. I can't believe
Scott has not texted me back.

38:28.067 --> 38:30.067
- Like...
- Where is he?

38:30.067 --> 38:31.900
How have I not seen him one day
this week?

38:31.900 --> 38:33.933
- He's psychotic.
- So first of all, whole

38:33.933 --> 38:36.300
entire plane flight, he's like,
"I'm coming, I'm excited."

38:36.300 --> 38:37.967
And then, he was at the hotel
the first night, and he asked

38:37.967 --> 38:39.633
Kourtney to hang out with him,
and Kourtney's like, "I'm in New

38:39.633 --> 38:41.467
York.
Like, I want to go see my

38:41.467 --> 38:43.467
friends."
Right.

38:43.467 --> 38:45.200
But he went out
that night.

38:45.200 --> 38:46.767
- So I guess he went out.
- He went out that

38:46.767 --> 38:48.400
- night.
- With his guy friends.

38:48.400 --> 38:50.233
I was, like, "Don't drink, be
good.

38:50.233 --> 38:51.900
Remember what we talked about."
So then, yesterday, he never

38:51.900 --> 38:53.933
wrote me back.
I go, "Okay, are you rested?

38:53.933 --> 38:56.033
'Cause you're gonna look so
handsome at the show next to

38:56.033 --> 38:59.433
Kourt."
Nothing.

38:59.433 --> 39:01.433
- Never wrote me back. Nothing.
- Just nothing?

39:01.433 --> 39:03.267
- M.I.A.
- He went out that

39:03.267 --> 39:05.100
night, the night before the
show.

39:05.100 --> 39:06.933
Jake's cousin saw him at
Up&Down.

39:06.933 --> 39:08.600
My friend saw him
at 1 Oak last night, too.

39:08.600 --> 39:10.433
I just don't
understand why Scott, like,

39:10.433 --> 39:12.267
doesn't want to make his life
better.

39:12.267 --> 39:14.100
He's got
everything.

39:14.100 --> 39:15.933
- Everything.
- You couldn't ask

39:15.933 --> 39:17.767
for anything more.
It's, like, amazing.

39:17.767 --> 39:19.433
Yeah. And he said he's
not happy inside, you know?

39:19.433 --> 39:23.733
I can only do so much for Scott.
I can't control him and I'm not

39:23.733 --> 39:26.167
gonna try to.
You can try so hard to help

39:26.167 --> 39:28.800
people, but you really can't
change them.

39:28.800 --> 39:31.967
It's easier, sometimes, just to
sit back, be supportive, but let

39:31.967 --> 39:34.933
them do what they want to do.
He just needs to figure this out

39:34.933 --> 39:37.267
- on his own.
- It's so sad.

39:37.267 --> 39:41.100
- It's dark.
- Lam sees a hearse and

39:41.100 --> 39:43.167
says, "Was I supposed to be in
one of those?"

39:43.167 --> 39:45.367
- God is good.
- God is great.

39:45.367 --> 39:47.133
God is good, but I
kind of want him to be a little

39:47.133 --> 39:54.133
more free.
This is, like, a second chance.

40:00.133 --> 40:02.033
Ooh! Borrowing all
the magazines?

40:02.033 --> 40:05.067
Oh, these are my
interior design ones.

40:05.067 --> 40:08.233
No flying magazines?
Like, airplane stuff?

40:08.233 --> 40:12.933
Oh! No, but there's a
safety card here you can read.

40:12.933 --> 40:15.967
I really wanted to,
like, mend that bridge with

40:15.967 --> 40:19.133
Caitlyn and extend the olive
branch and invite her on the

40:19.133 --> 40:22.467
- plane back to L.A. with us.
- How long was I in the

40:22.467 --> 40:24.133
- coma?
- You were in the coma

40:24.133 --> 40:27.033
for four days.
Lam sees a hearse and says, "Was

40:27.033 --> 40:28.733
I supposed to be in one of
those?"

40:28.733 --> 40:32.267
- But, like...
- Yeah.

40:32.267 --> 40:35.067
- No.
- No, I mean, he was...

40:35.067 --> 40:37.367
- God is good.
- God is great.

40:37.367 --> 40:39.367
God is good, but I
kind of want him to be a little

40:39.367 --> 40:44.000
more free.
You're very rare.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.533
Like, bad things can happen if
you go back to that life.

40:47.533 --> 40:49.633
Yeah, like I was
talking about it.

40:49.633 --> 40:52.300
This is, like, a
second chance... for life.

40:52.300 --> 40:55.733
- Yeah.
- The last time I came

40:55.733 --> 40:58.867
to New York, my cousin was
killed.

40:58.867 --> 41:03.300
And then the day after that, I
got into a car accident...

41:03.300 --> 41:06.133
- Yeah.
- ...and that kid died

41:06.133 --> 41:08.367
- in front of me.
- Yeah.

41:08.367 --> 41:11.233
So I do.
There's a thin line between life

41:11.233 --> 41:14.367
- and death.
- Yeah.

41:14.367 --> 41:17.967
- How are you doing?
- Good.

41:17.967 --> 41:22.000
Thanks to this lovely young
lady.

41:22.000 --> 41:24.167
Well, she certainly
was there for you.

41:24.167 --> 41:26.233
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

41:26.233 --> 41:31.300
Khloe was showing me
some pictures.

41:31.300 --> 41:41.167
Of when I was in the hospital.
Let me see the pictures?

41:41.167 --> 41:47.067
October 14.
To get to a hospital and hear

41:47.067 --> 41:51.333
that someone has four hours to
live and there's nothing you can

41:51.333 --> 41:56.900
really do, it's horrible.
Lamar wasn't able to walk.

41:56.900 --> 42:00.967
He had no facial recognition.
He did not know people's names.

42:00.967 --> 42:05.200
And now Lam is walking
perfectly.

42:05.200 --> 42:07.933
High five.
Person who wasn't walking a

42:07.933 --> 42:12.100
- month and a half ago.
- Into Madison Square

42:12.100 --> 42:14.933
- Garden.
- Into Madison Square

42:14.933 --> 42:18.467
Garden, baby.
I gotta get back out there with

42:18.467 --> 42:21.633
- a ball in my hand.
- When something as

42:21.633 --> 42:24.733
tragic as this happens, it does
make you hold onto life and

42:24.733 --> 42:27.500
think about things.
You're more in the moment and

42:27.500 --> 42:29.600
you don't take things for
granted as much as, maybe, you

42:29.600 --> 42:32.633
- once did.
- Isn't my friend Melanie

42:32.633 --> 42:36.800
- nice?
- The best.

42:36.800 --> 42:38.800
Melanie Griffith?

42:38.800 --> 42:41.000
She married Don Johnson
twice.

42:41.000 --> 42:42.933
- She did?
- If you're lucky, that

42:42.933 --> 42:44.933
could be you, Lamar.
Okay?

42:44.933 --> 42:47.133
- Yeah. If you're lucky.
- Wait, why did she

42:47.133 --> 42:48.600
- marry him twice?
- 'Cause they got a

42:48.600 --> 42:50.067
- divorce...
- I'll say my prayers.

42:50.067 --> 42:51.433
...and then they
decided they shouldn't be

42:51.433 --> 42:53.000
divorced.

42:53.000 --> 42:55.300
If you guys ever got married,
can we just skip the wedding

42:55.300 --> 42:58.167
- part?
- No.

42:58.167 --> 42:59.900
Oh. I was gonna say
"sure."

42:59.900 --> 43:01.667
But we're definitely getting out
of this marriage, because it's

43:01.667 --> 43:04.833
been a little tainted.
Call, call if you hear me.

43:04.833 --> 43:09.033
Just sayin', okay.

43:09.033 --> 43:10.967
I'm just saying we
need to cut our ties and we can

43:10.967 --> 43:13.633
figure it back out.
You know?

43:13.633 --> 43:15.533
Agreed.

43:17.733 --> 43:20.500
- On the next episode...
- Did you hear that

43:20.500 --> 43:22.733
- Rob bought a house?
- Yeah, Khloe's kind of,

43:22.733 --> 43:24.733
- like, freaked.
- It's his money.

43:24.733 --> 43:26.333
It's not his money,
'cause I know...

43:26.333 --> 43:28.000
- Yes, it is.
- I'm just allergic to

43:30.167 --> 43:32.867
- Welcome home!
- Can I just say I

43:32.867 --> 43:35.100
- don't like this rug in here?
- Okay.

43:35.100 --> 43:36.567
Let's remove the
stuff...

43:36.567 --> 43:38.233
Kourtney's just, like,
taking over.

43:38.233 --> 43:40.900
I just feel like they
had worked so hard all day and

43:40.900 --> 43:42.900
- we were just trying to...
- What do you want me

43:42.900 --> 43:46.100
to do, come over and lie?
