Previously on <i>Awkward...</i>

00:02.134 --> 00:04.401
- I'm breaking up with you.
- What happened?

00:04.403 --> 00:05.803
Are you sure there's
not something that I don't see?

00:05.805 --> 00:07.471
- No.
- I love you, Jake Rosati.

00:07.473 --> 00:08.873
- What did I do?
- Guess I just

00:08.875 --> 00:10.474
waited too long
to tell him how I felt.

00:10.476 --> 00:12.677
Maybe the timing's
finally right.

00:16.848 --> 00:19.183
I had been blogging all night,

00:19.185 --> 00:22.687
if only to keep my hands
occupied and off my phone.

00:22.689 --> 00:23.988
And after fighting the urge

00:23.990 --> 00:25.556
to text Jake for two days,

00:25.558 --> 00:27.692
my willpower was waning.

00:29.861 --> 00:32.396
My willpower had been waning.

00:32.398 --> 00:34.298
A lot.

00:38.704 --> 00:41.538
I'm breaking up with you.

00:41.540 --> 00:44.008
I wasn't the type of girl
to expiration-date,

00:44.010 --> 00:46.677
so if Jake thought our romance
was past its prime,

00:46.679 --> 00:50.347
I would accept his decision...

00:50.349 --> 00:52.282
If he had a damn good reason.

00:55.654 --> 00:58.455
No, I don't.

00:58.457 --> 01:00.357
I wasn't thinking clearly,

01:00.359 --> 01:01.826
but neither was he.

01:01.828 --> 01:03.160
I thought Jake and I
were happy,

01:03.162 --> 01:05.328
then wham, bam,
break up, ma'am.

01:05.331 --> 01:08.365
I must have done something
to damage our relationship,

01:08.367 --> 01:10.701
but what?

01:12.639 --> 01:14.605
Oh, cancel.
Cancel!

01:14.607 --> 01:16.573
Hey, come outside.

01:16.575 --> 01:19.443
I have a surprise for you.

01:22.949 --> 01:27.685
Kevster, it's Hannah.
Call me.

01:27.687 --> 01:30.320
So, Kevster, who's Hannah?

01:30.322 --> 01:33.590
Someone from work.
Don't peek.

01:35.093 --> 01:36.794
Huh?
Now all your friends

01:36.796 --> 01:39.830
will want to take
a joy ride in the Jenna wagon.

01:39.832 --> 01:42.266
That sounded bad.

01:42.268 --> 01:43.534
Check it out!

01:43.536 --> 01:45.536
It was the hoopty of my dreams,

01:45.538 --> 01:48.005
and I had to admit,
I was stoked...

01:48.007 --> 01:50.407
Until I remembered
Tamara's warning.

01:50.409 --> 01:52.242
A grand gesture meant divorce.

01:52.244 --> 01:54.712
Was my dad trying
to do damage control?

01:54.714 --> 01:56.781
Or was Jake?

You're supposed

I am sorry, J, but holy shit!

What am I gonna do?

02:22.741 --> 02:24.741
Be pissed.

02:24.743 --> 02:26.276
He was spying on you.

02:26.278 --> 02:29.113
- I'm just trying to spin it.
- Not working.

02:29.115 --> 02:31.448
Okay, let's stop
baking drama cakes for a sec,

02:31.450 --> 02:32.682
and think tank this.

02:36.622 --> 02:37.821
I don't even know why Jake

02:37.823 --> 02:39.390
was at my house
in the first place.

02:39.392 --> 02:40.790
Well, I guess after
he came back to the wedding

02:40.792 --> 02:41.992
looking for you.

02:41.994 --> 02:43.327
- What?
- He went back?

02:43.329 --> 02:44.694
Why didn't you
give me the heads up?

02:44.696 --> 02:46.130
I don't know.

02:46.132 --> 02:47.998
Maybe I was busy
buying lottery tickets

02:48.000 --> 02:49.133
'cause I'm a freakin' psychic.

02:49.135 --> 02:50.401
How was I supposed to know

02:50.403 --> 02:52.302
Jake was gonna
go back to your house?

02:52.304 --> 02:55.005
He probably wanted
to get back together.

02:55.007 --> 02:57.241
I had never considered
that possibility.

02:57.243 --> 03:00.077
Could there be a silver lining
to my storm cloud of despair?

03:00.079 --> 03:02.046
Fact is,
I wasn't cheating on Jake.

03:02.048 --> 03:03.247
So once we straighten out
the timeline--

03:03.249 --> 03:04.648
Everything will be okay.

03:04.650 --> 03:06.616
I just need to clear it up.

03:06.618 --> 03:08.252
How am I gonna clear it up?

03:08.254 --> 03:10.254
You're not a cheater.
Jake broke up with you,

03:10.256 --> 03:12.822
out of nowhere, which means
he has no leverage, right?

03:12.824 --> 03:14.024
It's a little thin,

03:14.026 --> 03:16.393
but it's all we've got.

03:21.933 --> 03:25.902
Jake, I really need
to talk to you for jus--

03:25.904 --> 03:27.104
What just happened?

03:27.106 --> 03:30.174
The classic ice burn.

03:31.709 --> 03:34.378
Oh!

03:34.380 --> 03:38.282
I wouldn't hit your head
like that if I were you.

03:38.284 --> 03:39.550
Seriously, you're killing
brain cells,

03:39.552 --> 03:41.218
and you don't have
any to waste,

03:41.220 --> 03:42.652
which is why you need this.

03:42.654 --> 03:45.222
Test answers, for geometry.

03:45.224 --> 03:46.756
Sweet.

03:46.758 --> 03:47.991
Stupid combo won't work.

03:47.993 --> 03:52.996
- Let me try.
- The combo is 21...

03:52.998 --> 03:54.864
You know my locker combo?

03:54.866 --> 03:57.834
I also know your bra size,
but I'm not gonna advertise it.

03:57.836 --> 04:00.270
32B.

04:00.272 --> 04:02.005
Uh...

04:02.007 --> 04:04.241
Since you seem to possess,
I don't know,

04:04.243 --> 04:07.344
universal knowledge,
do you know where Fred Wu is?

04:07.346 --> 04:09.146
I haven't heard
from him since Friday

04:09.148 --> 04:12.015
and we're usually
in constant contact.

04:12.017 --> 04:13.617
- What's his name again?
- Fred Wu.

04:13.619 --> 04:14.851
- Fred who?
- Wu.

04:14.853 --> 04:17.654
Oh, Fred Wu!

04:17.656 --> 04:19.255
I don't know him.

04:19.257 --> 04:21.791
But I do know
where your glasses are.

04:21.793 --> 04:23.527
You left them in my car.

04:23.529 --> 04:25.862
Oh, yes.
I thought I lost them,

04:25.864 --> 04:26.963
and in the afternoon,
my contacts

04:26.965 --> 04:29.032
start to feel like sandpaper.

04:29.034 --> 04:30.400
Thank you.

04:30.402 --> 04:32.969
No, thank you,
for giving my life a purpose.

04:32.971 --> 04:35.305
- Aw.
- I'm kidding.

Wha...

04:46.251 --> 04:47.451
Want to go in?
If he's mid-stream,

04:47.453 --> 04:48.985
he won't be able to run away.

04:48.987 --> 04:50.219
I don't think I can move.

04:50.221 --> 04:51.421
Do you need the pep talk again?

04:51.423 --> 04:52.823
'Cause I can rally.

04:52.825 --> 04:54.624
No, that's okay.

04:54.626 --> 04:55.659
Yeah, I need it.

04:55.661 --> 04:58.495
You are in the right here,
okay--

04:58.497 --> 05:00.797
- I didn't cheat on you!

05:00.799 --> 05:04.634
That was a warm-up.

05:06.403 --> 05:08.304
Jake, I know it looks bad.

05:08.306 --> 05:09.806
I mean, that photo,
it was awful,

05:09.808 --> 05:11.942
and I understand that looking
to Matty for comfort

05:11.944 --> 05:13.810
was a terrible choice,
but I wasn't cheating.

05:13.812 --> 05:16.980
Technically, I was single,
and devastated, and--

05:16.982 --> 05:19.916
- I know everything.

05:19.918 --> 05:23.186
Everything?

05:23.188 --> 05:24.387
Everything.

05:24.389 --> 05:25.722
It suddenly all made sense.

05:25.724 --> 05:28.224
I knew exactly why
Jake broke up with me.

05:28.226 --> 05:30.494
He knew everything.

05:30.496 --> 05:32.095
He knows everything?
What does that even mean?

05:32.097 --> 05:33.530
Oh, I'm not sure,

05:33.532 --> 05:35.832
but I assume "everything"
means "everything."

05:35.834 --> 05:37.968
No.
No. No way.

05:37.970 --> 05:39.836
Way.
Jake took this.

05:39.838 --> 05:41.505
Holy shit.

05:41.507 --> 05:43.006
Holy--
Holy shit!

05:43.008 --> 05:44.173
No wonder he won't talk to me.

05:44.175 --> 05:45.174
How the hell did this happen?

05:45.176 --> 05:46.710
You. Your lips.

05:46.712 --> 05:49.178
I was vulnerable
and you took advantage.

05:49.180 --> 05:51.815
Your lips
were pretty involved too.

05:51.817 --> 05:53.216
Oh, my God.

05:53.218 --> 05:55.184
- He knows everything?
- Everything!

05:55.186 --> 05:56.386
Well, who the hell told him?

05:56.388 --> 05:58.922
Yeah, I told him.

05:58.924 --> 06:01.090
I really don't understand
why you're so upset.

06:01.092 --> 06:02.392
Now that Jake is out
of the picture,

06:02.394 --> 06:03.994
she's all yours.

06:03.996 --> 06:06.062
I still don't get
the appeal of Jenna Hamilton

06:06.064 --> 06:07.731
and her oversized
maternity tops,

06:07.733 --> 06:09.566
but I guess the heart
wants what it wants,

06:09.568 --> 06:12.402
even if it wants a social misfit
with a butterfly fetish.

06:12.404 --> 06:15.438
- You're a bitch.
- I know.

06:15.440 --> 06:17.007
And you should be thanking me

06:17.009 --> 06:19.275
for removing the obstacle
that kept you apart.

06:19.277 --> 06:20.677
I can't believe
you would do this to me.

06:20.679 --> 06:22.378
We've been friends
since the fourth grade.

06:22.380 --> 06:24.480
You can try and make me
the villain in all this,

06:24.482 --> 06:26.583
but the truth is,
you're the bad guy here.

06:26.585 --> 06:28.919
You're the one who kept
this huge secret

06:28.921 --> 06:30.319
from your best friend.

06:30.321 --> 06:31.855
Maybe telling Jake
was the wrong thing to do,

06:31.857 --> 06:34.758
but what you and Jenna
did was way worse.

06:36.928 --> 06:39.963
Dude, you don't have
all the information.

06:39.965 --> 06:42.065
Come on, man, stop.

06:42.067 --> 06:45.168
Let's hash this out.

06:45.170 --> 06:47.037
- He won't talk to me.
- Me either.

06:47.039 --> 06:49.238
But I'm gonna try again.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.240
Jake.

06:51.242 --> 06:53.209
The everything
you think you know?

06:53.211 --> 06:54.444
Some of it's wrong.

06:54.446 --> 06:55.812
Yes, Matty and I had a thing,

06:55.814 --> 06:57.480
but it wasn't
an official thing.

06:57.482 --> 06:59.182
And it was over before
you and I became a thing,

06:59.184 --> 07:00.951
because we were official.

07:00.953 --> 07:02.518
Jenna.

07:02.520 --> 07:04.320
I don't remember you
being in this class.

07:04.322 --> 07:07.256
Oh, I'm not.
I just came to talk to Jake.

07:07.258 --> 07:10.259
Doesn't look like
he wants to talk.

07:10.261 --> 07:12.128
You gonna talk to her?

07:12.130 --> 07:14.197
No.

07:14.199 --> 07:15.565
Ms. Hamilton,
you have two options...

07:15.567 --> 07:17.801
- Stay here or go to class.
- I'll stay.

07:17.803 --> 07:19.302
Ah, that triggers
option number three.

07:19.304 --> 07:22.973
Follow me.

07:22.975 --> 07:25.174
After you.

07:31.882 --> 07:34.684
Fred!

07:34.686 --> 07:35.885
Fred Wu!

07:35.887 --> 07:37.453
What is your deal?

07:37.455 --> 07:40.590
Why won't you talk to me?

07:42.593 --> 07:44.961
I got a "D"?

07:44.963 --> 07:46.329
Did you guys get "D"s?

07:46.331 --> 07:48.197
What the hell?

07:48.199 --> 07:52.135
Did you guys get
a different cheat sheet?

07:57.541 --> 08:00.510
♪ Our chimney puffs
a lighter cloud ♪

08:00.512 --> 08:02.211
♪ I hear you don't
even make a sound ♪

08:02.213 --> 08:05.782
♪ once I recalled
the gall of that one ♪

08:05.784 --> 08:07.283
I'm starting to get the feeling

08:07.285 --> 08:08.451
I'm on the outs
with the Asian mafia.

08:08.453 --> 08:09.886
Disavowed?

08:09.888 --> 08:12.188
No idea, but I just
got a bum cheat sheet

08:12.190 --> 08:15.258
and weird stuff has been
happening all day.

08:15.260 --> 08:18.227
It feels cold on the outside.

08:18.229 --> 08:19.428
It does.

08:19.430 --> 08:21.131
Ladies and gentlemen,

08:21.133 --> 08:24.333
and those of you in between...

08:24.335 --> 08:26.036
How did it go with Jake?

08:26.038 --> 08:27.804
It didn't.

08:27.806 --> 08:29.405
Wildcats,
we're gonna get pumped up,

08:29.407 --> 08:32.142
with the wheel of

08:32.144 --> 08:34.477
pep!

08:34.479 --> 08:36.312
All right, you know how
this game is played, folks.

08:36.313 --> 08:40.482
I just need one female volunteer
to make that first spin.

08:40.485 --> 08:41.918
How can we explain
the situation

08:41.919 --> 08:43.720
if he won't hear us out?

08:43.722 --> 08:45.421
Come on, which one
of you lovely ladies

08:45.423 --> 08:49.625
would like to join me onstage
and spin that wheel?

08:52.262 --> 08:55.398
I'll make him listen.

09:00.666 --> 09:01.933
Jenna, please, not again.

09:01.935 --> 09:03.535
Lightning doesn't strike twice.

09:03.537 --> 09:05.370
I'm telling you, going up
on that stage is not gonna

09:05.372 --> 09:06.838
work out in your favor
this time.

09:06.840 --> 09:09.307
It will.
It has to.

09:09.309 --> 09:11.877
Uh, Jenna's raising her hand.

09:11.879 --> 09:14.278
- Can't you see it?
- We just need a girl.

09:14.280 --> 09:16.915
Any girl.

09:16.917 --> 09:19.250
Jenna Hamilton, come on up!

09:26.158 --> 09:29.360
Okay, now we need a dude.

09:29.362 --> 09:31.429
Not you, Clark,
we need a real dude.

09:31.431 --> 09:32.631
How about you?

09:36.669 --> 09:38.136
I didn't cheat on you.

09:38.138 --> 09:40.605
I slept with Matty
before I really even knew you.

09:40.607 --> 09:41.907
Mm-hmm.

09:41.909 --> 09:43.241
He never wanted
to be seen with me,

09:43.243 --> 09:45.343
which made things confusing
and unclear.

09:45.345 --> 09:47.779
Well, how about we fix that?

09:47.781 --> 09:48.914
Hm?

09:51.116 --> 09:54.185
Matty McKibben, come on up!

09:54.187 --> 09:56.187
Yeah.

09:56.189 --> 09:57.822
Let's give him some
encouragement, titans, huh?

09:57.824 --> 09:59.691
Matty! Matty! Matty!

09:59.693 --> 10:03.094
Matty! Matty! Matty!

10:14.740 --> 10:16.307
This isn't how you play.

10:16.309 --> 10:17.909
You can't stop
the wheel of pep.

10:17.911 --> 10:20.011
Zip it.
The rules have changed.

10:20.013 --> 10:21.746
I knew this was gonna happen.

10:21.748 --> 10:23.014
I really might be psychic.

10:23.016 --> 10:24.482
Okay, McKibben.

10:24.484 --> 10:26.785
Time to come clean.

10:26.787 --> 10:29.621
Have you ever betrayed anyone?

10:29.623 --> 10:33.157
- Maybe a friend?
- No.

10:33.159 --> 10:34.292
Well.

10:34.294 --> 10:36.160
Looks like Matty has put you
in the hot seat.

10:36.162 --> 10:38.597
If he's not willing
to come clean,

10:38.599 --> 10:41.066
then we're gonna have
to play dirty.

10:41.068 --> 10:44.002
Go, girl!
You got this!

10:44.004 --> 10:46.738
Jenna has a lot
of experience playing dirty.

10:46.740 --> 10:49.173
She should kiss Matty.

10:50.410 --> 10:51.610
Shut up, Sadie.

10:51.612 --> 10:54.512
No, great idea.

10:54.514 --> 10:56.314
Jenna, kiss Matty.

10:56.316 --> 10:59.350
Show some school spirit.
It's for the baseball team.

10:59.352 --> 11:01.620
- Please don't do this.
- Oh, are you shy?

11:01.622 --> 11:04.889
Would you be more comfortable
doing it privately?

11:04.891 --> 11:06.791
Or maybe in secret?

11:06.793 --> 11:08.960
I don't want you
to feel like a slut.

11:08.962 --> 11:10.561
- That isn't funny.
- Yeah, I agree.

11:10.563 --> 11:12.163
There's nothing funny
about being laughed at

11:12.165 --> 11:13.932
- by your friends.
- Back off, man.

11:20.707 --> 11:23.008
Stop!

11:23.010 --> 11:24.509
You don't know the whole story.

11:24.511 --> 11:25.710
I do!

11:25.712 --> 11:27.211
You talked to me about her.

11:27.213 --> 11:30.581
Huh? I gave you advice
about her.

11:30.583 --> 11:33.051
That must've been
really hilarious.

11:33.053 --> 11:34.585
I'm confused.
Are we playing a new game?

11:34.587 --> 11:37.221
Yes, it's called
"down with the slut."

11:37.223 --> 11:38.790
No one was
ever laughing at you.

11:38.792 --> 11:40.625
Well, then what were you doing?

11:40.627 --> 11:41.993
- Say it!
- Stop it!

11:41.995 --> 11:43.695
- What do you want me to say?
- The truth!

11:43.697 --> 11:45.697
Say it! Say it!

11:51.071 --> 11:52.804
I fucked your girlfriend!

11:58.443 --> 12:02.613
Two boys fighting over
a girl is...

12:02.615 --> 12:04.315
a fantasy for some women,

12:04.317 --> 12:06.685
but, uh, I am going
to have to put

12:06.687 --> 12:09.320
personal fantasies aside,

12:09.322 --> 12:11.289
because as vice-principal,
it is my job

12:11.291 --> 12:13.257
to punish boys for having

12:13.259 --> 12:17.428
those strong...
sexy feelings that...

12:17.430 --> 12:20.364
burst into action.

12:21.367 --> 12:22.433
The good news is,

12:22.435 --> 12:24.202
I'm not caught up
in your drama,

12:24.204 --> 12:25.970
and I am not gonna determine
who's right or wrong.

12:25.972 --> 12:27.371
It's your fault, isn't it?

12:27.373 --> 12:28.807
- Yes.
- Yeah.

12:28.809 --> 12:31.910
That point goes to Jake,
because he's not to blame.

12:31.912 --> 12:33.178
But he did cheat on
his last girlfriend,

12:33.180 --> 12:34.746
so this could
be karmic retribution.

12:34.748 --> 12:36.081
You're still even.

12:36.083 --> 12:37.381
Jake didn't really
cheat on Lissa.

12:37.383 --> 12:38.917
I'm surprised you would defend

12:38.919 --> 12:42.620
someone who just slammed
a fist in your face.

12:42.622 --> 12:44.122
Current score is 1-0

12:44.124 --> 12:46.224
in Matty's favor
for being noble.

12:46.226 --> 12:48.459
Noble?
I don't think so.

12:48.461 --> 12:49.828
All right, listen.

12:49.830 --> 12:51.462
I understand why this happened.

12:51.464 --> 12:53.598
As a layperson, I totally get
why you would fight over Jenna.

12:53.600 --> 12:56.300
I really like spending
time with her too,

12:56.302 --> 12:57.836
but I wouldn't necessarily
throw down for her.

12:57.838 --> 12:59.838
Okay, maybe.
I might.

12:59.840 --> 13:03.441
She is a really
remarkable friend.

13:03.443 --> 13:04.976
Student.
Student-friend.

13:04.978 --> 13:06.477
She's no friend of mine.

13:06.479 --> 13:08.079
Don't be mad at her.

13:08.081 --> 13:09.647
She wanted to tell you
and I asked her not to.

13:09.649 --> 13:12.250
This whole thing is my fault.

13:12.252 --> 13:13.852
When I heard you
broke up with her,

13:13.854 --> 13:15.253
I only went to her house
to see if she was okay,

13:15.255 --> 13:16.921
because I knew
how much she liked you.

13:16.923 --> 13:18.189
Shouldn't you have
been checking on me?

13:18.191 --> 13:20.658
I tried to,
but you shut me down.

13:20.660 --> 13:22.894
Bravo.

13:22.896 --> 13:25.930
Everyone can see the damage
to your faces,

13:25.932 --> 13:27.899
but no one can see
the damage to your hearts.

13:27.901 --> 13:30.368
I'm throwing away
the score sheet.

13:30.370 --> 13:32.203
You won.

13:32.205 --> 13:33.337
I think we learned a lot today

13:33.339 --> 13:35.573
about honesty and forgiveness.

13:35.575 --> 13:39.010
So, no more fighting?

13:39.012 --> 13:40.478
You're done?

13:40.480 --> 13:43.214
Yeah. We're done.

13:51.757 --> 13:56.060
Are you okay?

13:56.062 --> 13:57.695
Please say something.

13:57.697 --> 13:58.863
Anything.

13:58.865 --> 14:01.099
I came to your house,

14:01.101 --> 14:02.834
thinking that I made a mistake
breaking up with you.

14:02.836 --> 14:04.302
I made a mistake too.

14:04.304 --> 14:06.137
I should have told you
everything about Matty,

14:06.139 --> 14:07.972
but I didn't know how to.

14:07.974 --> 14:09.674
I never cheated on you.

14:09.676 --> 14:13.344
I loved you.
I still love you.

14:13.346 --> 14:14.545
Please believe me.

14:14.547 --> 14:19.350
Why would I believe
anything that you say?

14:23.588 --> 14:27.758
Ming. Ming.

14:27.760 --> 14:29.593
Ming.

14:29.595 --> 14:31.296
Ming.

14:31.298 --> 14:34.565
Why are you hiding?
We're in the sanctuary.

14:34.567 --> 14:35.934
Nowhere is safe.
Shh.

14:35.936 --> 14:39.103
What? Why are you
acting so creepy?

14:39.105 --> 14:42.640
First, you blow me off
and then you ignore me in class.

14:42.642 --> 14:44.508
I thought you liked me.

14:44.510 --> 14:47.511
I do like you.
A lot.

14:47.513 --> 14:49.347
Which is why I can never
speak to you again.

14:49.349 --> 14:51.316
Why?

14:51.318 --> 14:53.517
Becca is my ex-girlfriend.

14:53.519 --> 14:55.386
Damn.

14:55.388 --> 14:58.223
No wonder so much bizarre stuff
has been happening to me.

14:58.225 --> 14:59.623
And it's just the beginning.

14:59.625 --> 15:01.559
You're scaring me.

15:01.561 --> 15:02.760
You should be scared.

15:02.762 --> 15:04.162
Are you familiar
with the difference

15:04.164 --> 15:07.065
between a white bitch
and an Asian bitch?

15:07.067 --> 15:09.200
When a white bitch is after you,
she's in your face.

15:09.202 --> 15:11.002
Loud, angry,
making sure you know

15:11.004 --> 15:12.971
that she's responsible
for your destruction.

15:12.973 --> 15:14.272
But the Asian bitch--

15:14.274 --> 15:16.774
Derives from
the way of the ninja.

15:16.776 --> 15:18.576
They're everywhere and nowhere.

15:18.578 --> 15:20.111
All stealth.

15:20.113 --> 15:22.046
You never see
an Asian bitch coming.

15:22.048 --> 15:23.614
But she looks
so sweet and harmless.

15:23.616 --> 15:24.815
But she's not!

15:24.817 --> 15:27.886
And now nothing is safe.

15:27.888 --> 15:29.087
I can only drink
from sealed bottles of water,

15:29.089 --> 15:30.488
and as my known associates,

15:30.490 --> 15:33.524
I suggest you do the same.

15:33.526 --> 15:35.159
I heard Jenna homewrecked

15:35.161 --> 15:37.929
two relationships
in one weekend.

15:37.931 --> 15:40.731
She's
"homewrecker Hamilton."

15:40.733 --> 15:42.633
- Wha--
- Here.

15:42.635 --> 15:44.168
I'd trade your mafia wrath

15:44.170 --> 15:46.004
for my current situation
any day.

15:46.006 --> 15:47.939
Why does everyone get
to weigh in on my life?

15:47.941 --> 15:49.240
It's white bitch 101,

15:49.242 --> 15:50.841
but at least
you know where you stand.

15:50.843 --> 15:52.610
All this fear and loathing
is giving me

15:52.612 --> 15:54.412
a mad case of stress eye.

15:54.414 --> 15:56.847
Oh, you both need
to arctic chill.

15:56.849 --> 15:58.383
Jenna,
someone else's drama-rama

15:58.385 --> 16:00.218
will be front-page news
tomorrow.

16:00.220 --> 16:01.552
And ming, honestly, this whole
thing with the Asian mafia--

16:01.554 --> 16:04.255
Why can't I see anything?

16:04.257 --> 16:05.856
Holy shit.

16:05.858 --> 16:07.258
Becca changed my prescription.

16:07.260 --> 16:09.093
I've been Asian
bitch-slapped again!

16:09.095 --> 16:11.495
This day could
not get any worse.

16:11.497 --> 16:13.131
Ming was a blind optimist.

16:13.133 --> 16:15.099
What she couldn't see...

16:15.101 --> 16:18.769
was that things
could always get worse.

16:22.678 --> 16:26.081
I have never seen something
so offensive in my life.

16:26.083 --> 16:28.683
That car is no way
to bridge a relationship gap!

16:28.685 --> 16:30.451
Buying you a car
should have been

16:30.453 --> 16:32.988
a co-parenting decision.

16:32.990 --> 16:33.989
But a car that hideous

16:33.991 --> 16:37.892
should have been
a no-parenting decision.

16:37.894 --> 16:40.228
As usual, my mother
decided my humiliation

16:40.230 --> 16:41.529
was about her.

16:41.531 --> 16:44.432
Why in the world
would your father

16:44.434 --> 16:45.767
purchase a car

16:45.769 --> 16:48.336
with the word "slut"
written across it?

16:48.338 --> 16:50.271
It didn't come that way.

16:50.273 --> 16:53.842
This is just further proof
that your father needs me.

16:53.844 --> 16:56.477
He could never be trusted
to make big purchases alone,

16:56.479 --> 17:00.281
and a car is
a big financial commitment.

17:00.283 --> 17:01.482
<i>Marie Claire</i> said--

17:01.484 --> 17:02.884
Or was it <i>Cosmo?</i>

17:02.886 --> 17:05.053
Maybe it was on
<i>Real Housewives?</i>

17:05.055 --> 17:06.087
Mm.

17:06.089 --> 17:07.656
Someone smart said

17:07.657 --> 17:09.657
that if a couple is
in relationship recovery,

17:09.660 --> 17:11.192
or working on
getting back together,

17:11.194 --> 17:13.461
they need to create an
environment of mutual res--

17:13.463 --> 17:14.963
You're not getting
back together.

17:14.964 --> 17:17.665
He's seeing someone else.
Her name is Hannah.

17:17.667 --> 17:21.536
The car is just his way
of breaking it to me gently.

17:21.538 --> 17:22.871
It means he wants a divorce.

17:27.476 --> 17:31.412
I was feeling wrecked,
wronged, and worn-out.

17:31.414 --> 17:32.914
I couldn't take any more blows

17:32.916 --> 17:35.750
and definitely
couldn't cushion them.

17:35.752 --> 17:38.820
I had spent so much time
protecting Jake's feelings

17:38.822 --> 17:40.922
that my own
were left defenseless.

17:40.924 --> 17:46.094
The damage was done
and there was no way to undo it.

17:46.096 --> 17:48.462
"You're not a homewrecker."

17:48.464 --> 17:50.598
I'm glad someone knows.

17:50.600 --> 17:54.368
Homewrecker?
I never used that expression.

17:54.370 --> 17:55.904
Do you know me?

17:57.473 --> 18:00.241
Friend or foe?

18:00.243 --> 18:02.643
I don't know if I can trust
an invisible friend.

18:02.645 --> 18:04.278
Jake would say
an invisible friend

18:04.280 --> 18:05.847
can't trust me.

18:05.849 --> 18:07.615
"You can trust me.

18:07.617 --> 18:09.650
This isn't a set-up."

18:09.652 --> 18:10.952
I'm feeling desperate.

18:10.954 --> 18:13.321
There's no way
to minimize this damage.

18:13.323 --> 18:16.958
Everybody hates me.

18:18.795 --> 18:21.629
I wish I could put
into words what I feel.

18:21.631 --> 18:24.966
"You already have."

18:24.968 --> 18:28.236
You're the only one who knows
the whole truth.

18:28.238 --> 18:29.938
♪ Follow my way ♪

18:29.940 --> 18:33.875
♪ follow my... ♪

18:39.484 --> 18:42.119
- Everyone is talking about you.
- I know.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.820
No, Jenna.
Yesterday's slut-shaming

18:43.822 --> 18:46.190
is, like, 12 pages back
in the gossip search engine.

18:46.192 --> 18:49.193
Your secret blog?
Not so secret anymore.

18:49.195 --> 18:52.829
Jenna slept with Matty,
but she only screwed Jake...

18:52.831 --> 18:54.698
Over!
They didn't have sex!

18:54.700 --> 18:56.200
Thank God.

18:56.202 --> 18:58.702
She didn't just homewreck
two relationships.

18:58.704 --> 19:01.071
It was three,
if you count her parents.

19:01.073 --> 19:03.307
Yeah. The band
got back together.

19:03.309 --> 19:04.708
Are you in shock?
Are you gonna stroke out?

19:04.710 --> 19:06.343
Do you need a trauma blanket?

19:06.345 --> 19:08.745
- I just need to talk to Jake.
- And I need to get a life.

19:08.747 --> 19:10.447
I never realized
how Ricky-obsessed

19:10.449 --> 19:11.982
I was until I read it in print.

19:11.984 --> 19:14.584
Your blog saved me
from ever obsessing again

19:14.586 --> 19:16.453
and it saved ming
by outing the mafia.

19:16.455 --> 19:17.721
Now she's untouchable.

19:17.723 --> 19:19.323
I wouldn't be so sure.

19:19.325 --> 19:23.227
It's gonna take more than
a blog to take them down.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.134
Did you read my blog?

19:30.136 --> 19:31.601
Then you know the truth.

19:31.603 --> 19:33.804
I never cheated on you.

19:33.806 --> 19:36.873
No. You humiliated me.

19:40.111 --> 19:44.415
Rosati! You been played,
but you didn't get laid!

19:44.417 --> 19:47.418
The blog release
didn't just expose me.

19:47.420 --> 19:49.619
It exposed everyone in it.

19:49.621 --> 19:51.655
There was widespread
collateral damage.

19:51.657 --> 19:53.057
Who the hell did this?

19:53.059 --> 19:56.560
Who forwarded
Jenna's private blog?

19:59.998 --> 20:01.999
I did.

20:07.006 --> 20:09.739
Jenna Hamilton
tried to kill herself!

20:09.741 --> 20:11.075
Again!

20:11.076 --> 20:13.076
Next on Awkward...

20:14.012 --> 20:15.212
Are we looking at?
Lunch in the bathroom?

20:15.214 --> 20:16.580
What's going on?

20:16.582 --> 20:17.948
Your social suicide
scared everyone silent.

20:17.950 --> 20:19.950
- What you did was ballsy.
- And psychotic.

20:19.952 --> 20:22.153
Everyone knows
I wrote the letter.

20:22.155 --> 20:23.420
Go. Talk to them.

20:23.422 --> 20:25.455
What's the worst
that could happen?

20:25.457 --> 20:26.791
My life was full
of unexpected choices.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.358
Choices that
I didn't want to make.

20:28.360 --> 20:29.794
So you need to choose.

20:29.796 --> 20:31.028
Him or me.
