frankly a week from now, Zamir,

04:28.035 --> 04:29.969

04:29.970 --> 04:31.504
sometimes send a bad
message about Russia.

My perception?

05:51.952 --> 05:56.088
You really want to hear it?

05:56.089 --> 05:58.425
I'm not sure, but let's see.

05:58.426 --> 06:00.893
A former midlevel manager in

06:00.894 --> 06:02.595

06:02.596 --> 06:05.898
think that's very important,

06:05.899 --> 06:06.899
short, who has found himself

06:06.900 --> 06:08.100
master of the universe and like

06:08.101 --> 06:11.103
a lot of short people, if you

06:11.104 --> 06:13.573
tick them off, bad
things happen to you.

06:13.574 --> 06:17.009
He likes to take his
shirt off a lot.

06:17.010 --> 06:18.778
Let's be serious.

06:18.779 --> 06:21.280
He strikes me as a businessman.

06:21.281 --> 06:22.015
He is.

06:22.016 --> 06:23.950
A businessman with an ego.

06:23.951 --> 06:24.284
Okay.

06:24.285 --> 06:27.654
So he's like Donald
Trump but shorter.

I don't think you need to be a

11:48.942 --> 11:51.610

whoever did this very much

know who done it.

12:23.511 --> 12:25.444
visible example of how things

12:31.551 --> 12:38.958
difficult to find a sport

12:38.959 --> 12:39.226
did.

12:39.227 --> 12:42.294

question, if you wanted

12:42.295 --> 12:44.196

They spent more than $50 billion

12:52.472 --> 12:55.507
of dollars, which is the most

12:55.508 --> 12:56.843
expensive games of mankind.

12:56.844 --> 13:02.748
$26,000 a seat for
the curling stadium?

13:02.749 --> 13:04.383
To build?

13:04.384 --> 13:06.152
The road is 30 miles.

13:06.153 --> 13:08.654
Price for that, $9 billion U.S.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.722
This is a road, right?

13:10.723 --> 13:12.892
It's three times expensive than

13:12.893 --> 13:15.494
American program flying to Mars.

13:15.495 --> 13:17.864
And who got many of those
contracts for the roads and

13:17.865 --> 13:20.366
stadiums and infrastructure?

13:20.367 --> 13:23.102
Well, there's these guys.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.736
Putin's childhood friends and

13:24.737 --> 13:28.040
judo partners, the Rottenburg
brothers, whose companies

13:28.041 --> 13:30.943
received contracts worth
upwards of $7 billion.

13:30.944 --> 13:33.079
And Putin's associate of 20

13:33.080 --> 13:36.582
years, Vladimir Yakunin, who
owns the state railroads.

13:36.583 --> 13:40.086
His company received $10
billion worth of contracts.

13:40.087 --> 13:42.288
It's very easy to imagine

13:42.289 --> 13:43.555
what's happened with this money.

13:43.556 --> 13:44.124
Right.

13:44.125 --> 13:45.557
You know who cares in Russia?

13:45.558 --> 13:50.562
Just about no one.

13:50.563 --> 13:54.233
This is a case of
the Binenko case.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.801
A known enemy of Putin stricken

13:55.802 --> 13:59.638
with a bout of
radioactive polonium.

13:59.639 --> 14:00.107
Aren't you concerned?

14:00.108 --> 14:01.140
Me, about myself?

14:01.141 --> 14:01.808
Yeah.

14:01.809 --> 14:04.743
You're a pain in the ass.

14:04.744 --> 14:07.146
Tony, I was born
here 54 years ago.

14:07.147 --> 14:09.215
This is my country.

14:09.216 --> 14:12.084
The Russian people
are in trouble.

14:12.085 --> 14:14.921
Russian court doesn't work.

14:14.922 --> 14:16.122
Russian education
decline every year.

14:16.123 --> 14:20.659
I believe that Russia has
a chance to be free.

14:20.660 --> 14:21.428
Has a chance.

14:21.429 --> 14:25.365
It's difficult but
we must do it.

14:59.832 --> 15:00.667
America, yeah.

15:00.668 --> 15:03.702
All of Russia's
eyes are upon you.

15:03.703 --> 15:07.940
Bring honor to your... you
know what, America, I

15:07.941 --> 15:08.308
will break you.

15:08.309 --> 15:16.309
I will break you.

15:23.856 --> 15:24.291
Forget about it.

15:24.292 --> 15:32.292
I'll bury you.

15:34.134 --> 15:42.134
I'll rip up your visa!

15:55.155 --> 16:03.155
No!

16:03.830 --> 16:06.332
O'er the land of the free.

16:06.333 --> 16:07.333
Just missed it, buddy.

16:07.334 --> 16:09.535
That was pretty close.

16:09.536 --> 16:13.505
I was actually out here all
last night practicing.

16:13.506 --> 16:20.212
I'm kidding.

16:20.213 --> 16:22.048
While Zamir contemplates a

16:22.049 --> 16:22.749
suddenly grimmer future thanks

16:22.750 --> 16:26.218
to me, I head out to Rublevka, a

16:26.219 --> 16:28.087
compound of luxury homes outside

16:28.088 --> 16:35.861
Moscow, to meet
Alexander Levedu.

16:35.862 --> 16:39.698
At one time, Alexander
was doing great.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.267
Former officer of the
intelligence services like

16:41.268 --> 16:43.769
Putin, turned billionaire.

16:43.770 --> 16:46.705
He owned pieces of Russia's most

16:46.706 --> 16:48.274
powerful energy companies,

16:48.275 --> 16:52.544
airlines and banks, and still
publishes one of the only

16:52.545 --> 16:56.915
opposition newspapers
left in Russia.

16:56.916 --> 16:58.217
But running a newspaper that's

16:58.218 --> 17:01.487
been harshly critical of
the ruler has cost him.

17:01.488 --> 17:04.455
He's been stripped of
nearly everything.

17:04.457 --> 17:06.425
It can be a dangerous thing to

17:06.425 --> 17:09.395
do investigative journalism
in this country.

17:09.396 --> 17:13.232
Your own paper, five
journalists, six lost their

17:13.233 --> 17:13.433
lives?

17:13.433 --> 17:13.733
Yeah.

17:13.733 --> 17:15.300
Probably the biggest number

17:15.301 --> 17:17.669
because there was no war in this

17:17.670 --> 17:18.970
country, so in peaceful times,

17:18.971 --> 17:21.473
to lose six journalists
killed is quite a lot.

17:21.473 --> 17:24.242
Six journalists
murdered, one paper.

17:24.243 --> 17:25.676
Presumably for their reporting

17:25.678 --> 17:29.448
on political corruption
or human rights abuse.

17:29.449 --> 17:33.152
Though pointing a finger
directly at the government is

17:33.153 --> 17:34.486
impossible, one can say that the

17:34.487 --> 17:36.422
climate here is such that what

17:36.423 --> 17:41.327
you say can certainly
get you killed.

17:41.328 --> 17:42.528
You have at various stages made

17:42.529 --> 17:43.629
life difficult for yourself.

17:43.630 --> 17:44.497
Business was very good for you,

17:44.498 --> 17:46.765
then you had to have an opinion.

17:46.766 --> 17:48.500
When you interact with the

17:48.501 --> 17:50.469
local bureaucracies and judicial

17:50.470 --> 17:51.537
system, it still leaves a lot to

17:51.538 --> 17:53.772
be desired, let's
put it this way.

17:53.773 --> 17:56.108
Levedev is now a potato farmer.

17:56.109 --> 17:57.043
That's my production.

17:57.043 --> 17:57.844
That's my potato.

17:57.845 --> 18:01.813
The biggest producer in Russia,
true, but his billions

18:01.814 --> 18:03.549
are gone.

18:03.550 --> 18:05.117
He now lives the life
of a mere millionaire.

18:05.118 --> 18:06.685
Let's see how you like this one.

18:06.686 --> 18:07.520
Very good.

18:07.521 --> 18:08.954
Some freshly made potato chips

18:08.955 --> 18:13.892
that Levedev is very proud of.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.494
And his personal chef prepares

18:15.495 --> 18:17.028
Scottish salmon, smoked on

18:17.029 --> 18:22.334
cherry tree sawdust
served with avocado.

18:22.335 --> 18:22.502
Mm.

18:22.503 --> 18:23.702
Very good.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.405
Lately, he is getting
into slow food.

18:26.406 --> 18:30.676
This is cold pressed
cedar tree in Siberia.

18:30.677 --> 18:33.345
Cedar oil?

18:33.346 --> 18:34.580
But he has not slowed down his

18:34.581 --> 18:37.583
profile or kept his mouth shut.

18:37.584 --> 18:38.884
Recently, in a Russian talk

18:38.885 --> 18:41.086
show, he got in an argument over

18:41.087 --> 18:44.089
the financial crisis with
another guest, a heated

18:44.090 --> 18:44.391
argument.

18:44.392 --> 18:46.725
He ended up smacking the guy.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.560
I saw the incident on television

18:48.561 --> 18:49.728
that got you in trouble.

18:49.729 --> 18:53.232
I found it very refreshing,
actually, something that

18:53.233 --> 18:54.900
political discourse
could use more of.

18:54.901 --> 18:57.936
The government took the
opportunity to charge him with

18:57.937 --> 19:02.208
politically motivated
hooliganism, a charge that could

19:02.209 --> 19:04.843
have resulted in a penalty
of five years in prison.

19:04.844 --> 19:07.246
He is instead been
convicted of battery.

19:07.247 --> 19:09.114
He is working off his sentence

19:09.115 --> 19:12.083
painting fences and
shoveling snow.

19:12.084 --> 19:14.420
I mean, sitting on a bench

19:14.421 --> 19:15.721
and expecting to spend the next

19:15.722 --> 19:16.922
five years in prison with two

19:16.923 --> 19:19.691
small kids, it's not always, you

19:19.692 --> 19:22.261
know, very nice, but the guy
said something very bad.

19:22.262 --> 19:25.697
He said those who don't have a

19:25.698 --> 19:28.200
billion go [ Muted ] themselves.

19:28.201 --> 19:29.901
Though his victim did not

19:29.902 --> 19:31.737
register an official complaint,

19:31.738 --> 19:33.939
the message I think was clear.

19:33.940 --> 19:35.441
The charges were pressed by

19:35.442 --> 19:36.608
the Russian state which is funny

19:36.609 --> 19:37.943
because this is a
private accusation.

19:37.944 --> 19:42.781
It's dangerous, very
dangerous, to criticize or

19:42.782 --> 19:43.316
investigate or speculate.

19:43.316 --> 19:43.483
Why?

19:43.484 --> 19:46.585
Why do you care?

19:46.586 --> 19:52.791
Do you really think you
can defeat it, no.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.927
Hopefully, reason will prevail.

20:02.269 --> 20:05.238
♪

20:16.683 --> 20:18.149
It's the KGB.

20:18.150 --> 20:21.987
They're blocking your signal.

20:21.988 --> 20:23.955
I'm sure that they are,
believe it or not.

20:23.956 --> 20:24.990
I'm quite sure you've had

20:24.991 --> 20:29.160
someone on your tail the
entire time you've been here.

20:29.161 --> 20:30.929
What's rock and roll supposed

20:30.930 --> 20:34.466
to be about other than cars
and girls and aggression?

20:34.467 --> 20:35.534
About dissent.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.102
About rebellion, right?

20:37.103 --> 20:38.337
In Russia, where everything is

20:38.338 --> 20:40.171
supposed to be just fine, that

20:40.172 --> 20:47.212
can be a dangerous position.

20:47.213 --> 20:49.014
Travis link is an ex-pat

20:49.015 --> 20:53.319
American that manages
this band, Luna.

20:53.320 --> 20:58.957
Ruben Kazarian is Luna's
guitarist and song writer.

20:58.958 --> 21:04.363
It's very nice, we have
elections, democracy, courts,

21:04.364 --> 21:08.033
but always doesn't
work as it should.

21:08.034 --> 21:11.870
So that prevents right now
in Russia to speak freely.

21:11.871 --> 21:13.872
Formerly nothing but in
reality, a lot of things.

21:13.873 --> 21:18.209
Let's talk about MTV.

21:18.210 --> 21:19.078
Rebel music as I understand it

21:19.079 --> 21:21.713
was an MTV music series whose

21:21.714 --> 21:25.984
fundamental principle was
to celebrate bands who say

21:25.985 --> 21:29.421
difficult things in environments
where there might be

21:29.422 --> 21:29.756
repercussions.

21:29.757 --> 21:32.391
And as I understand it, your

21:32.392 --> 21:35.093
band was chosen for one
of seven episodes.

21:35.094 --> 21:35.395
Correct.

21:35.396 --> 21:38.864
And in fact, one of your
songs was used as the title

21:38.865 --> 21:41.600
track for the series.

21:41.601 --> 21:44.736
So I get a letter from the

21:44.737 --> 21:46.438
producer and essentially it says

21:46.439 --> 21:47.939
because of political pressure,

21:47.940 --> 21:50.241
the Russia episode has been

21:50.242 --> 21:52.077
removed from the
rebel music series.

21:52.078 --> 21:54.112
According to the producer,

21:54.113 --> 21:57.082
MTV Russia pushed back on the

21:57.083 --> 21:58.083
content, she presumes because of

21:58.084 --> 21:59.217
the negative impact it would

21:59.218 --> 22:00.919
have on them and their ability

22:00.920 --> 22:04.556
to do business on a
day-to-day basis in Russia.

22:04.557 --> 22:05.591
MTV's official reason for

22:05.592 --> 22:07.726
removing Luna from the series is

22:07.727 --> 22:09.194
that they simply did not have

22:09.195 --> 22:11.897
enough time to air all
the stories they filmed.

22:11.898 --> 22:14.265
This was a documentary series

22:14.266 --> 22:15.967
about musicians standing up and

22:15.968 --> 22:18.937
risking their lives in some
cases to stand up against

22:18.938 --> 22:21.072
government abuse of power,

22:21.073 --> 22:23.442
government corruption, and yet,

22:23.443 --> 22:26.812
a foreign government was able to

22:26.813 --> 22:27.414
editorially control what

22:27.415 --> 22:29.648
American viewers see
on their TV screens.

22:29.649 --> 22:32.418
That to me is a scandal
of epic proportion.

22:32.419 --> 22:34.386
This entire documentary's gone.

22:34.387 --> 22:38.657
Luna's song is the title track
to the series, but their

22:38.658 --> 22:40.959
episode never happened.

22:40.960 --> 22:45.631
The rest of Russia is very
very different than Moscow.

22:45.632 --> 22:48.233
Here, you drive around it's like

22:48.234 --> 22:51.136
Bentley, Ferrari, Maserati.

22:51.137 --> 22:52.771
You go to buy a pair of shoes,

22:52.772 --> 22:54.272
you pick up a Bentley
on the way out.

22:54.273 --> 22:55.441
You tour a lot in Russia.

22:55.442 --> 22:56.475
What do you see?

22:56.476 --> 22:57.976
We see a lot of problems.

22:57.977 --> 23:00.979
We see the level of
believing is very low.

23:00.980 --> 23:03.915
There is something in music
that unites everybody.

23:03.916 --> 23:06.418
It's something beyond politics.

23:06.419 --> 23:07.819
It's certain energy and this

23:07.820 --> 23:11.156
energy is the same in every
country, in every city.

23:11.157 --> 23:13.759
We have rock music, we
have common people.

23:13.760 --> 23:21.760
We're like you.

23:24.671 --> 23:32.671

started his career.

Roll on great steel wheels

through the night, through dark

23:58.671 --> 24:01.039
forests of birch and snow.

24:01.040 --> 24:04.009
Out there in the dark, visible

24:04.010 --> 24:05.376

May I propose a toast?

24:22.695 --> 24:25.831
To gentle chicken meats.

24:25.832 --> 24:26.265
Pro tip.

24:26.266 --> 24:28.333
If the word gentle is used on a

24:28.334 --> 24:33.238
menu, avoid those items and
stick to the classics.

24:33.239 --> 24:35.674
Like blini with caviar and cold

24:35.675 --> 24:40.712
pickled herring and potatoes and

24:40.713 --> 24:43.448
soup of sturnlgen,
olives and lemon.

24:43.449 --> 24:46.051
Is health care free
anymore in this country?

24:46.052 --> 24:47.686
Officially, it is free but if

24:47.687 --> 24:49.254
you want to get operation within

24:49.255 --> 24:51.256
a month, and you can't wait, you

24:51.257 --> 24:52.357

37:30.215 --> 37:34.552
You got to choose your
neighbors though?

37:34.553 --> 37:36.521
No.

37:36.522 --> 37:38.122
I got that.

37:38.123 --> 37:40.725
In the present day Russia

37:40.726 --> 37:42.327
there's never been a reason to

37:42.328 --> 37:47.298
create infrastructure to
make people's lives bet per.

37:47.299 --> 37:48.233
Nobody cared about the people

37:48.234 --> 37:51.869
that they should have a
decent toilet or shower.

37:51.870 --> 37:56.907
How is it lately, letter?

37:56.908 --> 37:57.142
Worse.

37:57.143 --> 37:59.076
So he changed the

37:59.077 --> 38:00.678
whole landscape in the country.

38:00.679 --> 38:06.083
First of all he clamped down
on the Democratic right.

38:06.084 --> 38:08.819
The most recent laws bring up

38:08.820 --> 38:12.857
the old Soviet union type of
structure in the country.

38:12.858 --> 38:17.728
So what happens next?

38:17.729 --> 38:20.665
A year before the

38:20.666 --> 38:22.433
Soviet union collapse, you would

38:22.434 --> 38:25.770
never believe in your wildest
dreams it would happen.

38:25.771 --> 38:29.407
Now it's symbolism, it looks

38:29.408 --> 38:31.876
stable, people are
busy, money is made.

38:31.877 --> 38:35.846
But it can't go on like
this for too long.

38:35.847 --> 38:38.849
So Uri predict we could be in a

38:38.850 --> 38:42.052
similar overnight
collapsing situation.

38:42.053 --> 38:44.555
So there is some hope...
You're due for some major

Putin's Sochi Olympics
