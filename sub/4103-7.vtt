00:08.070 --> 00:09.389
P/jnen
Pre v/ous/y on
screa m. . .

00:15.540 --> 00:17.030
(grunts)

00:17.310 --> 00:18.902
Emma;
We ’re not fr/ena's.

00:18.910 --> 00:21.777
We're not together.
We're done.

00:23.590 --> 00:25.319
I'm coming for
that sorry bitch!

00:25.320 --> 00:27.857
Why is your dna on
the inside of the mask?

00:27.860 --> 00:31.284
If you believe in your heart
audrey couldn't do this,

00:31.290 --> 00:32.689
You listen to that.

00:32.700 --> 00:33.450
I'm ready to talk.

00:33.460 --> 00:34.597
Nina and i both
made that video.

00:34.600 --> 00:37.922
The night that it went viral,
i went to audrey to confess.

00:37.930 --> 00:40.899
Are we even yet?
Getting close.

00:41.540 --> 00:42.199
(grunts)

00:42.200 --> 00:44.839
I'm not doing this again.
No one was supposed
to get hurt.

00:44.840 --> 00:46.762
If you try and burn me
with that video,

00:46.780 --> 00:48.839
They'll find you
in pieces in a ditch.

00:48.840 --> 00:50.376
Tyler and nina
had a video

00:50.380 --> 00:53.804
Of your dad doing things
he should not have
been doing.

00:53.820 --> 00:54.741
W/Y/ kept the video,

00:54.750 --> 00:56.843
And he picked up
where they left off.

00:56.850 --> 00:58.738
This is all the money
you've paid so far,

00:58.750 --> 01:00.615
And the last existing
copy of the video.

01:00.620 --> 01:03.783
I really don't wanna die
for doing the right thing.

01:03.790 --> 01:06.452
Remember, there's
a killer on the loose.

01:06.460 --> 01:08.394
It's not the story
i came for,

01:08.400 --> 01:11.369
But it's a hell of
a bonus chapter.

01:11.630 --> 01:13.188
(grunts)

01:20.440 --> 01:22.305
Piper! Help!

01:27.250 --> 01:30.469
(breathing heavily)

01:53.640 --> 01:56.108
(panﬁng)

02:29.880 --> 02:32.440
(muffled grunting)

02:37.350 --> 02:40.808
(door opens and shuts)

02:51.100 --> 02:52.294
(gasps)

02:52.300 --> 02:54.666
(muffled groaning)

03:06.650 --> 03:09.710
Uh-oh. You're making your
sausage and kale thing?

03:09.720 --> 03:11.711
Mmm-hmm.
It must be love.

03:11.720 --> 03:12.948
(scoffs)
(chuckles)

03:12.960 --> 03:16.509
All my meals with clark
have been out of styrofoam.

03:16.530 --> 03:19.727
We're having dinner at 7:00.
Clark's bringing kieran.

03:19.730 --> 03:21.459
(sighs)
i hope he likes it.

03:21.460 --> 03:23.121
It's the only thing
i know how to make.

03:23.130 --> 03:25.860
Mom, he's not
here for the kale.

03:25.870 --> 03:27.929
(both chuckle)

03:29.410 --> 03:32.732
Hey, i'm glad we talked.

03:32.740 --> 03:33.866
About brandon.

03:33.880 --> 03:35.507
Yeah. Me, too.

03:35.510 --> 03:40.538
I mean, it must've been hard
keeping it a secret all
those years.

03:40.550 --> 03:42.472
You learn to live with it.

03:45.620 --> 03:48.350
I mean, you said you guys
had a fight that night.

03:48.360 --> 03:51.818
How'd you move past that?
You got married, you had me.

03:51.830 --> 03:56.051
And even through everything,
i loved your dad.

03:56.070 --> 03:59.164
In a way, almost losing him
brought us closer together.

03:59.170 --> 04:02.435
And having you
certainly did.

04:02.740 --> 04:04.867
Then why'd he leave?

04:06.840 --> 04:09.729
Not everyone learns
to live with it.

04:10.480 --> 04:12.277
(car horn honking)

04:12.950 --> 04:15.817
Who_ is that?
Kleran.

04:18.250 --> 04:19.740
What?

04:21.320 --> 04:25.188
Mom, we are just friends.

04:31.470 --> 04:32.721
Bye.

04:34.000 --> 04:35.638
(chuckles)

04:45.280 --> 04:48.010
Do you think this
is wrong? (chuckles)

04:48.020 --> 04:51.615
You know, your dad,
my mom...

04:52.090 --> 04:55.548
The
hraa’y bunch
weirdness of all of it?

04:57.730 --> 04:59.948
We can always
press "pause."

04:59.960 --> 05:02.019
Uh... (chuckles)

05:02.230 --> 05:02.855
Okay.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.667
I mean, that's a good idea.
Maybe we should wait and see

05:04.670 --> 05:07.559
What's going
on with our parents.

05:07.570 --> 05:11.233
I mean, we don't wanna
become a reality tv show.

05:11.240 --> 05:14.562
(chuckles)
(bell rings)

05:17.680 --> 05:19.443
Right?

05:24.890 --> 05:29.088
Or maybe we can just call
this an evaluation phase?

05:29.090 --> 05:30.216
(chuckles)

05:30.230 --> 05:33.449
I like the way you think.
(cell phone chimes)

05:36.000 --> 05:37.251
(sighs)

05:37.270 --> 05:40.797
Everything okay?
Uh... (chuckles)

05:40.800 --> 05:42.199
Just will.

05:42.200 --> 05:44.498
Don't worry, he's harmless.

05:50.280 --> 05:51.645
Noah: There's my little felon.

05:51.650 --> 05:53.971
So glad my ordeal
brought you such amusement.

05:53.980 --> 05:56.949
It would've brought me
cold hard cash hawking
these bad boys,

05:56.950 --> 05:59.612
But then you got sprung early,
so... (chuckles)

05:59.620 --> 06:02.259
Silver lining,
my christmas shopping's done.

06:02.260 --> 06:05.229
Okay, before you ask about
my
shawshank redemption,

06:08.700 --> 06:09.621
Or get chin-checked.

06:09.630 --> 06:11.666
And i definitely did not
wear the four-piece.

06:11.670 --> 06:13.968
But you did
google prison slang.

06:13.970 --> 06:15.699
Yep, you got me.

06:15.700 --> 06:18.305
Uh, i'm really
glad you're back.

06:18.310 --> 06:21.199
And, you know,
not a demented psychopath.

06:21.210 --> 06:23.770
Jury's still out on that one.
(chuckles)

06:23.780 --> 06:27.500
But i'd still be there
if it wasn't for emma.

06:27.520 --> 06:28.669
Yeah.

06:28.680 --> 06:31.547
She really came through.
Hey.

06:31.550 --> 06:33.017
So did you.

06:33.020 --> 06:35.250
Emma told me
you went with her,

06:35.260 --> 06:38.650
And watching that video
must've really freaked
you out.

06:38.660 --> 06:39.684
What? No.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.918
I mean, not that
i even watched it.

06:41.930 --> 06:44.228
Uh-huh. Okay, so aside
from these lovely midterms

06:44.230 --> 06:47.119
I get to make up after
school, what did i miss?

06:47.140 --> 06:50.234
Well, i've been digging
more into our mysterious
mr. Branson.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.730
Mmm.
I tried running
a fingerprint

06:51.740 --> 06:53.765
But i got nothing,
so no priors.

06:53.780 --> 06:56.431
So maybe it's time to report
his ass for the malware?

06:56.450 --> 06:57.474
Oh, yeah, definitely.

06:57.480 --> 06:59.801
If it was still active.
Someone scrubbed it.

06:59.820 --> 07:03.472
Peep show's closed.
Almost like it never existed.

07:03.490 --> 07:06.641
And he's got a sub today.

07:08.390 --> 07:10.915
The "sub-plot" thickens.

07:11.130 --> 07:13.348
You get it?
(scoffs)

07:13.360 --> 07:16.693
You figure out where
the bedsheet in daddy's
deep freeze came from?

07:16.700 --> 07:19.794
The guest room.
Mom wanted to redecorate.

07:19.800 --> 07:22.268
(sighs) now she may
never get the chance.

07:22.270 --> 07:24.090
So why don't you just come
out point blank and say,

07:24.110 --> 07:26.499
"dad, where the hell
is my mom?"

07:26.510 --> 07:27.499
Idid.

07:27.510 --> 07:29.705
And he swears
she's in rehab,

07:29.710 --> 07:31.940
But he won't
tell me which one.

07:31.950 --> 07:37.172
He went out late last night,
came back all skullq.

07:37.390 --> 07:38.379
I don't know,
i just...

07:38.390 --> 07:42.087
I have a feeling something
really bad is going on.

07:42.930 --> 07:47.629
Hey! Um, have either
of you guys seen will?

07:47.630 --> 07:49.450
Not since
practice last night.

07:49.470 --> 07:51.495
But he was feeling
pretty rock-bottom.

07:51.500 --> 07:55.664
So, i bet he was hella-deep
in a bottle of his dad's
cheap-label whiskey.

07:55.670 --> 07:59.060
(scoffs) which is exactly
where he belongs.

07:59.780 --> 08:00.530
What?

08:00.540 --> 08:03.134
He texted me that he tried
to fix things last night,

08:03.150 --> 08:03.900
But it failed.

08:03.910 --> 08:05.241
I don't know.
It was weird.

08:05.250 --> 08:07.639
You said your dad
went out last night?

08:08.520 --> 08:09.316
Yeah.

08:09.320 --> 08:13.313
I think i may know
who he was meeting.

08:13.320 --> 08:14.912
What're you talking about?

08:14.920 --> 08:19.584
Jake found out that will's
been blackmailing my dad.

08:19.600 --> 08:24.822
He had a video of him
doing something pretty bad.

08:25.670 --> 08:26.967
But where is will?

08:26.970 --> 08:30.098
I don't know.
We don't know.

08:30.110 --> 08:33.830
Right, jake? Right, jake?

08:36.650 --> 08:38.504
We need to talk.

08:49.960 --> 08:51.621
Where the hell are we?

08:51.630 --> 08:56.192
This is the place where
will and i did the money drop
with your dad.

08:56.200 --> 09:00.569
I can't believe you tried
to put all of the blame
on will.

09:00.570 --> 09:01.161
Such a dick.

09:01.170 --> 09:04.162
I'm sorry. But let's look
at the bigger picture, okay?

09:04.170 --> 09:05.159
Like, if it wasn't for us,

09:05.170 --> 09:06.398
You wouldn't even
know about your dad.

09:06.410 --> 09:09.231
So i think that that should
carry a little more weight...
Guys, stop!

09:09.240 --> 09:11.800
Okay? We've all
done bad things.

09:11.810 --> 09:13.778
Can we just focus
on finding will?

09:14.950 --> 09:18.886
So will wanted to return
the money and the phone
with the video on it.

09:18.890 --> 09:20.517
He was trying to do
the right thing,

09:20.520 --> 09:23.614
And he wanted a witness,
and i wanted a story.

09:23.630 --> 09:26.622
So, uh, you're gonna
tell that story?

09:26.630 --> 09:28.052
Well, it's kind
of what i do.

09:28.060 --> 09:32.099
But let's just focus on
finding your friend first.

09:32.100 --> 09:32.896
So where is he?

09:32.900 --> 09:37.064
The mayor left, and then
that masked freak showed up.

09:37.070 --> 09:40.699
He tried to kill me,
and will...

09:41.280 --> 09:43.236
Will saved my life.

09:43.450 --> 09:46.305
I came to,
my head was pounding,

09:58.730 --> 10:02.257
Oh, my god.
(groans)

10:02.260 --> 10:04.296
Hey.
Are you okay?

10:04.300 --> 10:07.189
Just a mild concussion
but I'm okay.

10:07.200 --> 10:09.589
You guys,
take her outside.

10:09.610 --> 10:10.235
No, emma.

10:10.240 --> 10:14.802
I'll meet you out there.
Ijust need to think.

10:24.020 --> 10:25.612
(door opens)

10:27.020 --> 10:28.578
(door closes)

10:28.890 --> 10:30.619
(cell phone rings)

10:30.630 --> 10:33.349
Oh, my god.
Vl//7/:
Emma? Emma, he/p/

10:33.360 --> 10:34.554
Will? Are you okay?

10:34.560 --> 10:37.324
/(/7/er.'
He/io, emma.
iii/sang something?

10:37.330 --> 10:39.696
You son of a bitch.
Where is he?

10:39.700 --> 10:42.863
You broke his head.
He ’5 moved on.

10:44.440 --> 10:46.169
Now what would he
the fun in that?

10:46.170 --> 10:47.501
Okay. (breath trembling)

10:47.510 --> 10:52.300
Don't hurt him.
Where is he?
Where is he?

10:52.310 --> 10:54.449
I thought you were
done with him.

10:54.450 --> 10:55.974
That's not what i meant.

10:55.980 --> 10:58.380
Just... What do you want?

10:58.390 --> 11:00.540
lVew game,
hide and seek.

11:00.560 --> 11:03.518
Just l/lre o’aisy
ano’ brano’on used
to play.

11:03.530 --> 11:07.227
Okay. I know about
daisy and brandon.

11:07.230 --> 11:08.390
My mom told
me everything.

11:08.400 --> 11:09.628
Your mom ’5
a hung whore!

11:09.630 --> 11:11.029
In time, you’ll
know the truth.

11:11.030 --> 11:12.918
But first
you better fino' wﬂ/l

11:12.930 --> 11:15.239
W/ll:
Emma! No. No!

11:22.040 --> 11:25.043
Oh, sharon, i wish
society would've kept us.

11:25.050 --> 11:26.847
Emma: Just call me
back, okay?

11:26.850 --> 11:27.748
How's my partner-in-crime?

11:27.750 --> 11:29.615
I was just about to start
a new pathfinder campaign

11:29.620 --> 11:31.542
If you're up for some
non-felonious fun.

11:31.550 --> 11:33.347
Noah, do you have any
idea where audrey is?

11:33.360 --> 11:34.440
She's not
answering her phone.

11:34.460 --> 11:36.917
Uh, she's taking the midterm
she missed in the clink.

11:36.930 --> 11:39.558
Her phone's off.
You okay?

11:39.560 --> 11:40.549
No, not really.

11:40.560 --> 11:42.926
Look, will needs help.
Finding his moral compass?

11:42.930 --> 11:46.627
No, finding his phone.
Do you have any idea
how to track it?

11:46.640 --> 11:49.666
Yes. An app called
"find my phone."

11:51.170 --> 11:54.333
Well, i may be familiar with
some gps guidance sofbnare.

11:54.340 --> 11:58.128
But why would i do
tech support for him?

11:58.150 --> 11:59.640
Why would you?

12:01.620 --> 12:03.247
So he doesn't die.

12:05.320 --> 12:08.448
Brooke! What a nice surprise.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.984
I know what's been going on.

12:14.430 --> 12:18.321
I know about will.
I know about the money.

12:18.330 --> 12:21.219
I know about everything!
Keep your voice down.

12:21.240 --> 12:24.789
Daddy, will's missing.
He was attacked.

12:24.810 --> 12:28.337
And i know that you
met him last night.

12:28.340 --> 12:30.171
Piper shaw was there.

12:30.180 --> 12:31.602
She heard everything!

12:31.610 --> 12:33.942
Brooke, i have no idea.

12:33.950 --> 12:37.044
Daddy, i've been
defending you to my friends,

12:37.050 --> 12:43.114
Trying to convince myself that
i'm wrong, that mom's okay.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.018
I told you, your mom's fine.

12:45.030 --> 12:47.658
She's in rehab in arizona.

12:48.260 --> 12:50.990
I've seen the video.

12:52.170 --> 12:53.990
You were moving a body.

12:54.000 --> 13:00.508
(scoffs) what you saw
is not what it looks like.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.977
And we're not
discussmg
this anymore.

13:04.780 --> 13:06.441
Jake: Brooke?

13:07.320 --> 13:08.912
Is everything okay?

13:10.420 --> 13:12.684
I want you to tell
me the truth.

13:13.790 --> 13:16.258
Do you know where will is?

13:16.990 --> 13:20.050
Honey, i swear.

13:21.460 --> 13:23.599
I have no idea.

13:24.430 --> 13:26.762
I really hope so.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.490
And mom better be okay.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.798
Because the truth
will come out.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.301
And i won't protect you.

13:35.740 --> 13:37.571
Let's go, jake.

13:37.580 --> 13:39.104
Brooke?

13:40.280 --> 13:41.599
Brooke!

13:44.220 --> 13:46.939
Dradis contact.
I've got the phone.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.018
I don't see anything.

13:48.020 --> 13:51.114
Someplace out past
the crossroads.
(door opening)

13:51.130 --> 13:52.085
I'm going.

13:52.090 --> 13:53.057
(door closing)
by yourself?

13:53.060 --> 13:57.099
She won't be by herself.
You'll be with us.

13:57.100 --> 13:58.124
Guys, no.

13:58.130 --> 13:59.768
This psycho is
playing sick games.

13:59.770 --> 14:01.522
I cannot ask
you guys to come.

14:01.540 --> 14:02.438
You don't have to.

14:02.440 --> 14:05.659
We got your back.
And will's.

14:06.070 --> 14:09.073
Don't we?
Walt. ..

14:09.440 --> 14:10.702
We?

14:10.710 --> 14:14.009
Spotty cell signal,
but this is definitely
the area.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.978
Okay. Creepy building,
psycho killer.

14:16.990 --> 14:18.173
Time to weapon up.

14:18.190 --> 14:19.839
I got a skinner
and a gut hook.

14:19.860 --> 14:21.851
Wait, why, exactly?
(cell phone rings)

14:21.860 --> 14:24.385
To skin and gut things?

14:27.100 --> 14:28.453
/(ieran.'
Hey, you almost here?

14:28.460 --> 14:30.951
Kieran!
Uh, not exactly.

14:30.970 --> 14:33.723
Awkward family time
was your mom's idea.

14:33.970 --> 14:34.868
Where are you?

14:34.870 --> 14:37.430
I can't tell you
right now.

14:37.440 --> 14:38.190
Are you with will?

14:38.210 --> 14:39.563
No, its not what
you ’re th/nk/ng.

14:39.570 --> 14:41.208
Emma, tell me what's
going on. Are y...

14:41.210 --> 14:43.804
Are you safe?
Yes, i'm safe.

14:43.810 --> 14:46.074
Okay. Do you
need my help?

14:46.080 --> 14:50.141
I... I'm gonna need you
to cover for me, okay?

14:50.350 --> 14:51.214
So,

14:51.220 --> 14:54.087
You want me to tell
the 'rents you're at audrey's?

14:54.090 --> 14:57.218
Yeah. Yeah, helping
her study for midterms.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.528
Thank you so much.
I owe you one.

14:59.530 --> 15:02.624
Yeah, you do.

15:06.400 --> 15:09.130
We gotta find a way in.

15:09.140 --> 15:10.869
Okay. You guys
go that way.

15:10.870 --> 15:12.007
Noah and i are
gonna go this way.

15:12.010 --> 15:13.204
And we'll meet
you around back.

15:13.210 --> 15:15.474
That sounds like the first
of many bad decisions.

15:15.480 --> 15:16.799
Write your blood type
on your boots

15:16.810 --> 15:18.675
And leave your letters
to your loved ones.

15:18.680 --> 15:21.001
Let's shake n' jake.

15:28.090 --> 15:29.955
(birds squawking)

15:30.790 --> 15:32.382
(chittering)

15:32.590 --> 15:35.627
Noah, you have
to stop doing that.
(glass crunching)

15:35.630 --> 15:36.597
Well, i would
walk backwards,

15:36.600 --> 15:37.897
But there's a lot
of broken glass.

15:37.900 --> 15:39.595
You're making me more nervous
than i already am, okay?

15:39.600 --> 15:43.764
Sorry. As much as i enjoy
a good indie horror flick,

15:43.770 --> 15:46.534
In real life,
it's just really terrifying.

15:46.540 --> 15:48.428
This doesn't feel right.

15:48.440 --> 15:52.342
I mean, why is he changing
the game all of a sudden?

15:52.350 --> 15:54.910
It's 'cause he's playing
chess instead of checkers.

15:54.920 --> 15:57.047
It started with riley,
and now will.

15:57.050 --> 16:00.019
He's making you responsible
for who lives or dies.

16:00.020 --> 16:02.887
And i have all of
the pieces to lose.

16:03.260 --> 16:04.158
He's hiding behind a mask.

16:04.160 --> 16:06.082
There's nothing that
i can take away from him.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.853
Unless you figure out
who he is.

16:07.860 --> 16:10.454
Until then, he'll just
keep upping the game.

16:10.470 --> 16:13.564
It's like this whole thing,
you know, leading us here,

16:13.570 --> 16:15.993
It's like he wants you
to think you have some power,

16:16.000 --> 16:17.592
And then he can
just take it all away.

16:17.610 --> 16:19.430
Sounds like you admire
this guy or something.

16:19.440 --> 16:24.935
What? No! He's like
this crazy, psycho loser,
killer guy.

16:24.950 --> 16:26.577
I mean, if he wants
me to find will,

16:26.580 --> 16:28.639
Why not just
leave the door open?

16:28.650 --> 16:29.469
Classic cat and mouse.

16:29.480 --> 16:32.483
He likes to play with his
food before he eats it.

16:32.490 --> 16:36.608
Unless maybe he'd rather
get right to the main course.

16:38.560 --> 16:40.482
I just had a thought.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.923
Your mom would be so proud.

16:42.930 --> 16:44.227
Jake: We're out here in
the middle of nowhere,

16:44.230 --> 16:47.495
And we don't even know
what we're walking into.

16:47.500 --> 16:50.367
All because
nerd hq led us here?

16:50.370 --> 16:53.737
What are you saying,
noah's the killer?

16:53.740 --> 16:55.833
I'm just saying,

16:55.840 --> 16:56.977
On every cop show,

16:56.980 --> 16:59.301
There's always that
one harmless guy

16:59.310 --> 17:00.902
That's usually
the vic's roommate

17:00.920 --> 17:04.139
Or her manager at
the coffee shop that's like,

17:04.150 --> 17:07.483
"susie's dead?
That's horrible!"

17:07.790 --> 17:08.518
(scoffs)

17:08.520 --> 17:10.715
Did you know that you
sound like him right now?

17:10.730 --> 17:13.483
Nine times out of 10,
that guy's the killer.

17:13.500 --> 17:17.197
And he's usually sweet
and funny and uber smart.

17:17.200 --> 17:19.919
Well, that takes
you off the table.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.860
Or does it?

17:41.060 --> 17:42.459
Mmm.

17:46.860 --> 17:50.057
So, congratulations.

17:50.270 --> 17:51.658
Thanks.

17:52.670 --> 17:55.264
Detective brock's
off the case.

17:55.270 --> 17:58.569
I'm gonna miss her.
Yeah, i'm sure you will.

17:58.570 --> 18:01.232
So, kieran,
how are you adjusting?

18:01.240 --> 18:02.138
You like lakewood so far?

18:02.140 --> 18:07.476
Yeah. Well, aside from
all the murders, it's nice.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.687
What is this place?

18:19.260 --> 18:20.750
I don't know.

18:20.760 --> 18:23.228
It's not a happy place.

18:31.540 --> 18:35.135
Emma: Hello? Will?

18:45.790 --> 18:47.417
It's a bowling alley.

18:49.120 --> 18:55.628
Whoa, that is the most mack
daddy jaguar-and-space—shuttle
mural i've ever seen.

18:59.500 --> 19:01.889
Jake? Come on!

19:03.640 --> 19:05.039
You can't rush the jake.

19:05.040 --> 19:08.259
(sighs)
(groans)

19:08.280 --> 19:11.829
Your fists are like little
ball-peen hammers.

19:13.780 --> 19:15.941
Brooke:
Thanks for waiting up.

19:15.950 --> 19:18.919
It smells like
wet dog and car wax.

19:18.920 --> 19:19.716
Jake: Yummy.

19:19.720 --> 19:22.416
(thuds)
noah: Whoa!

19:23.660 --> 19:25.628
Whoa. Well,
that was terrifying.

19:25.630 --> 19:27.780
Brooke: God, i hate bowling.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.318
Emma: Okay.

19:31.530 --> 19:33.395
I understood why he
took me to the hospital,

19:33.400 --> 19:36.437
But why would he
bring will here?

19:36.440 --> 19:37.737
Yeah, this place is big.

19:37.740 --> 19:39.059
We should split up
finding will.

19:39.070 --> 19:43.234
Said no one who survived
a horror movre, ever.

19:43.240 --> 19:45.470
Noah, you come with me.
You guys stay together.

19:45.480 --> 19:49.712
Noah: This is dumb,
but fine, don't listen.

19:50.990 --> 19:55.882
So i hear you and emma
are spending a lot of
time together.

19:56.520 --> 19:58.408
How's that going for you?

19:58.960 --> 20:00.928
Just making friends.

20:02.330 --> 20:05.868
It's too bad that emma
had to miss tonight.

20:05.870 --> 20:08.088
Yes.
Maggie: You know what?

20:08.100 --> 20:11.137
She can help audrey study
another time, i'll call her.

20:11.140 --> 20:14.405
Oh, no, no, why don't
i just pick her up myself?

20:14.410 --> 20:15.138
Really?

20:15.140 --> 20:19.770
Yeah, um, thank you so much.
This was great.

20:21.550 --> 20:25.884
Wow. He could not get
out of here fast enough.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.558
So quiet.

20:29.560 --> 20:33.257
(scoffs) yeah, until all the
running and screaming starts.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.725
(clattering)

20:37.730 --> 20:39.891
Oh! Okay, i'm sorry,

20:39.900 --> 20:41.925
But all of this just
screams bad idea.

20:41.940 --> 20:43.567
Look, you can still
go if you wanna go.

20:43.570 --> 20:46.539
No. This psycho
took riley from me.

20:46.540 --> 20:49.532
I can't just let him
take will from you.

20:49.540 --> 20:52.509
Even if he was
kinda asking for it.

20:52.510 --> 20:54.501
Well, thanks for staying.

20:55.250 --> 20:56.740
Wait.

21:01.290 --> 21:04.009
On a scale of one to 10,

21:04.030 --> 21:08.080
Exactly how mad
are you at me?

21:08.300 --> 21:11.019
Eleventy.
Come on.

21:11.030 --> 21:12.566
I made a stupid mistake.

21:12.570 --> 21:16.267
But there's a killer
on the loose.

21:16.770 --> 21:19.762
_No one should_ die
wrth unresolved Issues.

21:20.240 --> 21:23.403
Anger or otherwise.

21:24.710 --> 21:25.847
Oh, my god.

21:25.850 --> 21:30.514
Are you actually using fear
of death to get in my pants?

21:30.520 --> 21:32.545
Absolutely not.

21:32.850 --> 21:35.512
Unless that
would comfort you.

21:37.560 --> 21:39.778
You're unbelievable.

21:40.360 --> 21:42.999
I'll take that as a "no."

21:43.230 --> 21:45.289
Noah:
Hey, let me ask you something.

21:45.500 --> 21:48.822
Do you find shake'n jake's
story a little bit odd?

21:48.840 --> 21:50.467
How so?

21:51.210 --> 21:54.600
I mean, if jake suspected
will was going to meet
maddox last night,

21:54.610 --> 21:57.101
Don't you think he would've
tried to stop him?

21:57.110 --> 21:57.974
What do you mean?

21:57.980 --> 22:01.108
I mean, maybe jake
did try to stop him,

22:01.120 --> 22:05.841
Wearing a black raincoat
and a brandon james mask.

22:06.120 --> 22:08.111
Are you saying that
jake is the killer?

22:08.120 --> 22:08.882
(shushing)

22:08.890 --> 22:13.259
I'm just saying, playing
the fool is a pretty
great cover.

22:13.260 --> 22:15.751
And he was pretty eager
to tromp into danger

22:15.760 --> 22:18.627
With the only people who
know about what he did.

22:18.630 --> 22:20.928
And pack a whole
lot of knives.

22:28.640 --> 22:31.939
Come on, brooke,
i was yanking your chain.

22:31.950 --> 22:33.303
You're like a caveman.

22:33.310 --> 22:36.177
Dumb, crass,
barely housebroken.

22:36.180 --> 22:40.947
We can't all
_be metrosexual
like seth branson.

22:41.790 --> 22:43.781
What are you
talking about?

22:43.790 --> 22:49.353
Please, the affair with
the un-named college guy?

22:49.360 --> 22:52.966
Hashtag not subtle.
(sighs)

22:53.500 --> 22:57.038
Whatever. It's over.

22:58.740 --> 23:02.164
Just a word of advice,

23:02.180 --> 23:04.535
If you want women
to like you,

23:04.550 --> 23:08.646
Drop the whole
frat-boy thing.

23:08.650 --> 23:10.140
Just be real.

23:16.760 --> 23:18.216
Yes.

23:19.360 --> 23:21.248
Good.

23:25.200 --> 23:27.065
'cause nature calls.

23:27.070 --> 23:29.061
Emma: We looked everywhere.

23:32.410 --> 23:34.162
Noah: Maybe will's not here.

23:34.180 --> 23:36.978
He's gotta be here.
It's part of the game.

23:36.980 --> 23:37.901
I'm missing something.

23:37.910 --> 23:40.105
What exactly did
your psycho say?

23:40.110 --> 23:41.008
That it was hide and seek.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.612
But what do you hide
in a bowling alley?

23:42.620 --> 23:44.042
Besides will, obviously.
Obviously.

23:44.050 --> 23:50.114
Uh, the guts, you know,
like the, the place where
you make it all work.

23:51.860 --> 23:53.725
Let's find out.

24:09.640 --> 24:11.005
Oh, wait.

24:12.150 --> 24:14.106
Help me!
Yeah, okay.

24:15.550 --> 24:16.369
(sighs)

24:16.380 --> 24:20.384
Jake, hurry up. Shake it off.

24:20.390 --> 24:22.984
(loud clang)
(gasps)

24:26.590 --> 24:29.058
Emma? Noah?

24:29.060 --> 24:30.994
(clatter)
(gasps)

24:31.270 --> 24:32.760
(screams)

24:37.870 --> 24:39.667
(emma gasping)

24:39.670 --> 24:41.103
Will!

24:42.910 --> 24:47.040
Will! (gasping)
hey! Cut him down!

24:47.050 --> 24:49.769
Uh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Okay.

24:49.780 --> 24:51.645
Hurry!

24:51.650 --> 24:53.015
It's okay.

24:53.020 --> 24:56.319
Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay.

24:57.360 --> 25:01.251
Okay. (grunts) okay. Okay.

25:01.260 --> 25:04.423
Oh, no, this is bad.
This is bad.
(sobbing)

25:04.430 --> 25:06.261
This is not good.

25:08.940 --> 25:09.690
Here.

25:09.700 --> 25:11.395
(slapping) will!

25:18.550 --> 25:20.040
(panﬁng)

25:23.380 --> 25:25.519
Emma: Will, wake up.

25:26.320 --> 25:27.981
The killer is here.

25:29.160 --> 25:30.957
And jake is
still out there.

25:30.960 --> 25:33.827
Oh, god. Will!

25:35.460 --> 25:39.567
Will! Come on.
Come on, wake up!

25:39.570 --> 25:40.468
Come on!

25:40.470 --> 25:42.426
(cell phone rings)

25:42.440 --> 25:43.589
Emma: Come on, come on!

25:43.600 --> 25:46.364
Audrey?
Noah. Hey, i'm done

25:46.370 --> 25:47.632
And in serious
need of caffeine.

25:47.640 --> 25:50.507
Audrey, hey, hey,
hey, do you hear me?
Come on!

25:50.510 --> 25:51.738
(stutters) uh, i'm
with emma right now.

25:51.750 --> 25:55.208
(voice breaking up)
we're at a bowling alley
past the cross roads.

25:55.220 --> 25:56.141
Noah?

25:56.150 --> 25:57.947
lVoah, i can ’t hear you.

25:57.950 --> 25:59.144
We found will but...
What?

25:59.150 --> 26:02.415
He ’5 unconscious and bleeding.
N 0a h , i . . .

26:03.960 --> 26:06.781
No. No, no, no, no, no!
Come on! Come on!

26:06.790 --> 26:09.258
(crying) no.

26:09.800 --> 26:11.449
Please!

26:12.400 --> 26:15.267
This can't be
how you die!

26:17.100 --> 26:18.567
(gasps)

26:18.770 --> 26:20.704
(sobbing) oh, my god!

26:21.510 --> 26:23.978
Noah: Yeah, get him up,
get him up.

26:34.690 --> 26:36.351
Emma: It's okay.

26:36.360 --> 26:37.509
(crying)

26:37.530 --> 26:39.350
(doorbell rings)

26:41.160 --> 26:42.991
Audrey?
Hey, mrs. D.

26:43.000 --> 26:45.457
What are you doing here?
Where's emma?

26:45.470 --> 26:47.620
She's not here?
Wait, she's supposed
to be with you.

26:47.640 --> 26:50.598
Kieran went
to pick her up.
Hudson: What's going on?

26:51.140 --> 26:52.869
I honestly don't know.

26:52.870 --> 26:54.132
Uh, emma was trying
to reach me

26:54.140 --> 26:56.734
And i called noah but
he sounded totally freaked.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.071
The connection was bad
and the call dropped,

26:58.080 --> 27:01.709
But i think he
said something
about will bleeding.

27:01.720 --> 27:04.018
Where are they?
At the bowling alley.

27:04.020 --> 27:06.341
Out past the crossroads.

27:06.350 --> 27:09.387
I'll call in for back up.
It's okay, don't worry.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.018
Get me deputy newsome.

27:13.430 --> 27:16.422
I'm so sorry.
This is bad.

27:16.430 --> 27:18.318
(grunts)
brooke: Oh, god.

27:18.330 --> 27:19.558
Noah: That's a lot of blood.

27:19.570 --> 27:23.233
You need stitches,
but this is gonna have to do.

27:23.240 --> 27:24.491
Noah: Um, while
you're doing that,

27:24.510 --> 27:27.968
I'm just gonna
go guard the door.

27:28.310 --> 27:31.837
Um, i'm gonna go with you.

27:34.450 --> 27:35.269
(will grunts)

27:35.280 --> 27:36.542
Wait. Piper.
What happened to piper?

27:36.550 --> 27:41.544
She's okay, she's okay.
She said that you
saved her life.

27:43.020 --> 27:46.820
I'm sorry.
I didn't want this.

27:49.960 --> 27:50.756
What are you doing?

27:50.770 --> 27:52.988
Uh, i'm making
a knife stick.

27:53.000 --> 27:53.728
Knife stick?

27:53.730 --> 27:56.130
You know, 'cause
the odds of surviving
a hand-to-hand attack

27:56.140 --> 27:59.667
Increase exponentially
with distance, so...

27:59.870 --> 28:01.701
Here, just...

28:08.050 --> 28:10.769
I don't wanna know
why you're better
at this than me.

28:10.790 --> 28:13.145
You know it's just
a spear, right?

28:13.150 --> 28:16.415
I don't understand.
Why didn't he just kill me?

28:16.420 --> 28:19.981
Because he knew that
i would come and find you.

28:19.990 --> 28:22.424
No, em, you shouldn't have.

28:22.430 --> 28:26.389
Look, i can't pretend
that you didn't hurt me,
because you did,

28:26.400 --> 28:29.767
But this is happening
because of me. Not you.

28:29.770 --> 28:30.566
(inhales sharply)

28:30.570 --> 28:33.767
What's wrong?
(grunts) my back.

28:33.770 --> 28:34.998
Let me see.

28:35.010 --> 28:36.477
(grunts)

28:38.950 --> 28:39.746
Em, what is it?

28:39.750 --> 28:44.346
He carved something.
Some more games.

28:46.550 --> 28:47.744
Jake is still out there.

28:47.760 --> 28:51.218
How do we know he's not
partnering up with this guy?

28:53.230 --> 28:55.380
How do we know
you're not, okay?

28:55.400 --> 28:57.550
You're the one
who brought us here.

28:57.900 --> 29:01.028
Okay, hold on.
You guys came to me.

29:03.100 --> 29:05.159
I could be curled up
on a comfy gaming couch
right now

29:15.650 --> 29:17.641
Brandon james worked here?

29:19.520 --> 29:23.354
It's a tape of my dad.
"ptsd project."

29:23.360 --> 29:24.019
(feedback hums)

29:24.020 --> 29:27.888
(music playing over speaker)
da/sy, o’a/sy

29:27.900 --> 29:31.358
give me your answer, do

29:31.370 --> 29:35.466
Cue creepy murder music.
I knew i was missing
something.

29:35.470 --> 29:36.459
all for the love of you

29:36.470 --> 29:40.736
Guys, this is gonna
sound ridiculous,
but i'll be right back.

29:40.740 --> 29:42.970
Are you joking?
Hey, seriously, em,

29:42.980 --> 29:44.902
That's, like,
famous last words.

29:44.910 --> 29:46.946
Will: No, em. (grunts)

29:46.950 --> 29:48.770
Help me up.

29:51.450 --> 29:53.816
Okay, we can't let emma
go out there alone,

29:53.820 --> 29:54.844
And we need
to find jake, okay?

29:54.860 --> 29:59.285
We need weapons.
Yeah. I'm way
ahead of you.

29:59.290 --> 30:02.123
da/sy, da/sy

30:02.130 --> 30:06.692
give me your answer, do

30:10.500 --> 30:12.536
(wood breaks)
(gasps)

30:17.310 --> 30:20.746
da/sy, da/sy

30:20.750 --> 30:24.516
give me your answer...

30:32.160 --> 30:33.787
Dr. Pell:
How have you
been sleep/77g, kevin?

30:33.790 --> 30:36.020
Kevin:
I keep having nightmares.

30:37.160 --> 30:39.663
Kevin:
About them. Together.

30:39.670 --> 30:42.161
I can ’t get that image
out of m y head

30:42.170 --> 30:45.230
Hid/ng in that
bowling alley.

30:45.240 --> 30:47.606
I know i let her down.

30:47.610 --> 30:49.066
I know i hurt her.

30:49.080 --> 30:52.129
But how could she sleep
with that monster?

30:52.150 --> 30:54.038
Oh, my god.

30:58.020 --> 30:59.578
(will grunts)

31:00.050 --> 31:01.483
It'll work.

31:01.490 --> 31:02.684
(jake screams)

31:02.690 --> 31:03.509
(panting) jake!

31:03.520 --> 31:05.818
Jake: Help! Where are you?

31:08.230 --> 31:09.026
Jake needs our help!

31:09.030 --> 31:12.090
Or he's luring us out,
just like he did emma!

31:12.100 --> 31:13.465
Well, we can't wait.

31:13.470 --> 31:14.425
I'll go out and find them.

31:14.440 --> 31:16.658
And you two need
to find a way out, okay?

31:16.670 --> 31:17.864
(groans)
you can barely stand!

31:17.870 --> 31:21.761
But hey, if you wanna
make it easier for him,
just be my guest.

31:21.780 --> 31:23.372
(all screaming)

31:24.110 --> 31:25.737
Noah! Ahhh!

31:27.350 --> 31:28.772
(screams)

31:34.520 --> 31:36.078
Brooke, go!

31:38.290 --> 31:39.985
Noah, go!
Okay.

31:39.990 --> 31:41.389
(grunts)

31:50.600 --> 31:53.034
(crying) jake! No!

31:53.240 --> 31:55.105
No.

31:58.350 --> 32:00.238
Jake!

32:00.780 --> 32:02.338
(both gasping)

32:02.350 --> 32:04.079
Oh, my god!

32:04.290 --> 32:05.746
(chuckles)

32:05.750 --> 32:07.911
You weep for the jake?

32:07.920 --> 32:09.649
(sobbing)

32:09.660 --> 32:12.151
We're gonna get
you out of here.

32:12.430 --> 32:14.386
That would be good.

32:14.400 --> 32:17.392
Yeah. This part won't be.

32:24.370 --> 32:26.099
(screams)

32:30.080 --> 32:33.538
Jake? Where are you?

32:33.950 --> 32:35.508
Brooke: Emma!

32:42.120 --> 32:43.587
(grunts)

32:44.060 --> 32:46.881
Officer: Emma duval,
are you in here?

32:50.160 --> 32:50.819
Will, stay here.

32:50.830 --> 32:53.219
We're here!
We're here!
Emma duval?

32:53.230 --> 32:53.798
Yeah.

32:53.800 --> 32:55.427
Go, check on them,
check on them! Go.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.965
The killer is still here.
He's somewhere back there.

32:57.970 --> 32:59.164
Find him.

32:59.170 --> 33:01.058
Kieran: Emma!

33:01.780 --> 33:03.338
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

33:03.340 --> 33:04.568
No, i'm fine.
What are you doing here?

33:04.580 --> 33:07.572
I was driving around.
I heard the call on
the police scanner.

33:07.580 --> 33:09.047
I came as fast as i could.

33:09.050 --> 33:11.473
Brooke: Help! Over here!
Jake's hurt!

33:11.490 --> 33:15.347
Officer: We gotta get
these kids out of here.
Go, go!

33:17.930 --> 33:20.490
Hey, hey!
It's me,
i'm friendly!

33:20.490 --> 33:24.654
Come on. I found
a quicker way out
of this hell hole.

33:30.170 --> 33:32.297
(siren blares)
hey!

33:32.310 --> 33:34.266
Brooke: Over here!

33:34.270 --> 33:35.669
Mom!
Emma.

33:35.680 --> 33:38.638
Search this place,
top to bottom!
Officer 2: Yes, sir!

33:38.650 --> 33:39.503
Cover the exits!

33:39.510 --> 33:42.070
Are you hurt?
Show me.

33:42.520 --> 33:44.010
Okay.

33:51.290 --> 33:55.021
Cu_e tear for
a reunion montage.
(chuckles)

34:00.930 --> 34:04.730
(indistinct talking)

34:25.590 --> 34:26.852
There's no sign of him?

34:44.850 --> 34:47.546
So, emma, do you have any
idea why you were led there?

34:47.550 --> 34:50.917
Look, whoever's doing this
is trying to open my eyes

34:50.920 --> 34:53.286
About the people
closest to me.

34:53.690 --> 34:56.488
And it all goes back
to brandon james.

34:56.490 --> 34:59.482
You can't keep doing things
like this on your own.

35:00.530 --> 35:03.328
I think it's time she
had a protective detail.

35:03.330 --> 35:04.729
I agree.
No!

35:04.730 --> 35:07.790
Look, jake is
gonna be okay.
Will is recovering.

35:07.800 --> 35:10.735
What, and you wanna call this
a win because you survived?

35:10.740 --> 35:12.958
No, that...
(doorbell rings)

35:13.670 --> 35:15.206
That is kieran.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.407
Emma, this is
getting insane.

35:18.410 --> 35:21.277
I mean, you asked me
to lie for you and i did,

35:21.280 --> 35:23.043
No questions asked,

35:23.520 --> 35:26.171
But you gotta give
me something.

35:28.760 --> 35:33.982
Look, it's not like
i could've asked you
to help me save my ex

35:33.990 --> 35:35.184
From a masked killer.

35:35.200 --> 35:38.920
Yeah, actually,
you could have.

35:41.340 --> 35:44.036
You still have
feelings for him?

35:46.210 --> 35:48.462
It was an intense night.

35:49.710 --> 35:52.634
We were together
for a long time.

35:52.650 --> 35:54.777
That doesn't just go away.

35:54.780 --> 35:56.714
I get that.

36:00.350 --> 36:01.886
I like you.

36:04.320 --> 36:05.810
Ijust...

36:08.860 --> 36:10.748
You need some time.

36:13.100 --> 36:14.567
You're mad.

36:16.270 --> 36:17.862
No.

36:18.640 --> 36:20.460
I just know what i want.

Sorry, but how do i know
it's actually you this time?

36:55.210 --> 36:58.077
Well, uh. . .

36:59.050 --> 37:00.142
On our second date,

37:00.150 --> 37:06.168
I took you to Indian food
and you curry-burped your way
through
maze runner.

37:06.190 --> 37:08.988
(chuckling) okay.
(will laughs)

37:08.990 --> 37:09.888
How are you feeling?

37:09.890 --> 37:14.953
Uh, sore. And boreo’.
Bed rest blows.

37:14.960 --> 37:16.359
But i do have a cool new scar.

37:16.360 --> 37:21.024
You know what, it sounds
like maybe it's finally
time to get netflix.

37:21.030 --> 37:22.588
(chuck/es)
uh, yeah.

37:22.600 --> 37:29.768
Well, i do have a well-lo ved
well-worn b/u-ray of
the expendables.

37:29.780 --> 37:31.031
(both chuckling)

37:31.040 --> 37:32.439
Come watch with me.

37:32.450 --> 37:36.773
I saved your life
yesterday and that's how
you're gonna repay me?

37:36.780 --> 37:38.816
(will laughs)

37:39.020 --> 37:42.046
Oh, i think my
mom just pulled in.

37:42.060 --> 37:46.884
Uh, you should come over.
She’d love to see you.

37:47.730 --> 37:49.550
We both would.

37:53.070 --> 37:54.594
Okay.

38:05.080 --> 38:07.674
And he lives
to fight another day.

38:07.680 --> 38:09.147
I never did
find knife-stick.

38:09.150 --> 38:11.778
It was probably recruited
into the killer's arsenal.

38:11.790 --> 38:14.247
Brainwashed into thinking
he was a weapon of evil.

38:14.250 --> 38:18.254
Hey, can we go back with my
camera and shoot a modern-day
b/air witch

38:18.260 --> 38:19.989
With a retro
bowling alley theme?

38:19.990 --> 38:21.753
I'm never setting foot
in that place again.

38:21.760 --> 38:25.753
That was slimy,
asbestos-sprinkled torture.

38:27.030 --> 38:27.860
But illuminating.

38:27.870 --> 38:31.397
I mean, will was kidnapped
and jake was stabbed.

38:31.410 --> 38:33.867
Probably safe to take them
both off the killer board.

38:33.870 --> 38:37.499
Unless that was exactly
what it was meant to do.

38:38.410 --> 38:39.138
Jake's on the mend,

38:39.150 --> 38:41.869
Will's wounded warrior act
made emma forgive hIs sms.

38:41.880 --> 38:44.519
Either one of 'em could
have set up this entire fiasco

38:44.520 --> 38:47.318
Just to convince
us to trust them.

38:47.320 --> 38:48.412
That's dark.

38:48.420 --> 38:50.217
You going to tell
emma this theory?

38:50.220 --> 38:52.484
No, she's been
through enough.

38:52.490 --> 38:53.627
But then i wouldn't be
surprised

38:53.630 --> 38:57.452
If will was making up
for lost time with emma
from his sick bed.

38:57.460 --> 38:59.223
From laid-up to laid.

38:59.230 --> 39:02.222
Please, i think emma's
a little smarter than that.

39:02.440 --> 39:04.692
Well, we'll see.

39:06.070 --> 39:08.163
(cell phone rings)

39:11.210 --> 39:13.508
Hey.
Will: (distorted)
