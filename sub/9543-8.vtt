00:27.560 --> 00:29.796
Dex. Excuse me.

00:29.831 --> 00:32.365
They're waiting for a final decision
about the cover.

00:32.400 --> 00:36.069
Ah, all right.
Well, what do you think, darlin'?

00:36.104 --> 00:39.239
Um, that one. - Mm.

00:39.274 --> 00:42.538
And which one would you pick
if it was you on the cover?

00:44.472 --> 00:46.808
That one. - That one. Yeah.
We'll take that one.

00:46.843 --> 00:49.309
And make sure there are
more girls here tonight.

00:49.344 --> 00:50.717
Last week was like a stag party.

00:50.752 --> 00:53.987
- This is paradise on earth, remember?
- It's taken care of.

00:54.022 --> 00:59.025
Elliott, you're early.
The party doesn't kick in till midnight.

00:59.060 --> 01:01.205
Dexter, I'm not here for the party.

01:01.240 --> 01:03.329
Amber, this is, uh, Elliott D'Souza,

01:03.364 --> 01:06.399
Chief Financial Officer
for Dharman Publishing.

01:06.434 --> 01:08.411
You know, which means,
technically,

01:08.436 --> 01:10.403
this pencil pusher is my boss.

01:10.438 --> 01:13.566
Dex, we have to talk... privately.

01:14.707 --> 01:16.698
Go wait by the pool.

01:18.144 --> 01:21.636
Dex, I made a decision.
I wanted you to hear it from me.

01:22.882 --> 01:26.319
The magazine is hemorrhaging dollars.
It just isn't paying for itself.

01:26.354 --> 01:29.189
It's not your fault.
The whole industry is shrinking.

01:29.224 --> 01:30.442
It's the Internet. It's videos...

01:30.477 --> 01:33.626
Sapphire magazine
is more than a magazine.

01:33.661 --> 01:36.162
- It's a way of life.
- Well, that may be true.

01:36.197 --> 01:39.232
But the corporation just can't carry
you and this fantasy world anymore,

01:39.267 --> 01:41.860
so I've decided to pull the plug.

01:43.123 --> 01:45.871
- So that's it, huh?
- I'm afraid so.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.847
Hey. It was fun while it lasted.

01:53.882 --> 01:57.217
Actually, I'm surprised
you waited this long.

01:57.252 --> 02:01.051
Listen, Elliott. Can you do me a favor,
one last favor?

02:03.857 --> 02:05.992
Don't make any announcement
for a day or so.

02:06.027 --> 02:09.077
This is our anniversary party.
Let me enjoy the weekend.

02:09.112 --> 02:12.365
Of course. - And that means
you can't tell anybody.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.601
Those bastards on the board
never could keep a secret.

02:14.636 --> 02:16.870
Yes, I understand.
It can wait until Monday.

02:16.905 --> 02:18.891
Are you sure that you don't wanna stay?

02:18.926 --> 02:20.707
No. No, thank you.

02:20.742 --> 02:23.409
Oh. I know, I know.
You're goin' home.

02:23.444 --> 02:26.880
Asleep by midnight, up at 7:00,
work out for 35 minutes.

02:26.915 --> 02:30.717
My... Elliott, you are so...
predictable.

02:30.752 --> 02:33.107
You should stick around,
have some fun.

02:33.142 --> 02:34.621
I'm gonna pass, Dexter.

02:34.656 --> 02:37.290
Gonna be a hell of a party.
You know me.

02:37.325 --> 02:40.350
I'm goin' out with a bang.

03:01.247 --> 03:03.816
Elliott, it's Dex.

03:03.851 --> 03:06.753
- This a bad time?
- No. I'm in the gym.

03:06.788 --> 03:07.749
How was the party?

03:07.784 --> 03:10.690
It must have been great.
I don't remember a thing.

03:10.725 --> 03:15.295
Uh, listen. I was wondering
if you'd reconsider your decision.

03:15.330 --> 03:18.431
No. I'm afraid not, Dex.

03:18.466 --> 03:22.335
Aw, come on. What about keeping
the mansion open? Just the mansion.

03:22.370 --> 03:26.139
- We could rent it out.
- Dex. Dex, don't even ask.

03:26.174 --> 03:30.276
The place is drowning in red ink.
We're gonna have to sell it.

03:30.311 --> 03:33.346
- Is that your final decision?
- I'm afraid so, Dexter.

03:33.381 --> 03:36.849
Okay. It's your funeral.

03:36.884 --> 03:41.047
Dexter, let's not be
so dramatic, shall we?

03:57.269 --> 04:00.560
MONK Season 2 Epi. 08
Mr. Monk Meets the Playboy

04:54.360 --> 04:56.294
Not too much off the top.

04:56.362 --> 04:58.631
- Just an eighth of an inch.
- I know.

04:58.666 --> 05:02.902
Okay. I... I wanna look rugged,
but... not too macho.

05:02.937 --> 05:06.237
Don't worry. You're not
gonna look too macho.

05:06.272 --> 05:07.607
It's a little long.

05:07.642 --> 05:11.077
You know, this was not
in my job description.

05:11.112 --> 05:12.575
What happened to your regular barber?

05:12.610 --> 05:15.470
I don't know.
Every time I go there, it's closed.

05:15.505 --> 05:16.816
I wonder why.

05:16.851 --> 05:19.852
Last time I went, I thought
I saw him in the back room,

05:19.887 --> 05:24.324
but I guess it couldn't have been him.
See? You're... You're still long.

05:24.359 --> 05:26.245
You see that? That's three-sixteenths.

05:26.280 --> 05:27.927
Adrian, these are very sharp scissors.

05:27.962 --> 05:30.296
Don't piss me off.

05:30.331 --> 05:32.423
I'll get that.

05:35.234 --> 05:38.067
Adrian Monk's office.

05:39.539 --> 05:42.475
Uh-huh. It's a job.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.516
Yeah. 10:00 tomorrow is fine.

05:44.551 --> 05:46.579
Make it 11:30. It's trash day.

05:46.614 --> 05:48.781
10:00. We'll be there.

05:48.816 --> 05:51.181
Thanks.

05:51.250 --> 05:56.380
Mr. Monk? And you...You must
be Sharona. Oh, thank you for coming.

05:56.456 --> 05:59.186
I'm Diane Luden. I am...

05:59.258 --> 06:01.249
I was Elliott D'Souza's assistant.

06:02.395 --> 06:04.530
I'm sorry. Wasn't I
supposed to shake hands?

06:04.565 --> 06:07.166
You're the first private
detective I ever met.

06:07.201 --> 06:09.268
Oh, no. Don't worry.
It's not you. It's him.

06:09.303 --> 06:11.371
Please, come in.

06:11.406 --> 06:15.875
Uh, Ms. Luden,
the elevator we just took,

06:15.910 --> 06:17.977
that's obviously a private elevator.

06:18.012 --> 06:21.572
That's right. It comes
straight up to the penthouse.

06:21.647 --> 06:24.411
Um, I found him Sunday morning.

06:24.484 --> 06:26.475
He was in there,
in his private gym.

06:26.552 --> 06:28.243
Yeah, yeah.
We heard about it on the news.

06:28.278 --> 06:29.455
They said he had a heart attack.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.423
That's what they thought at first.

06:31.491 --> 06:34.949
But they did an autopsy,
and it wasn't a heart attack.

06:35.027 --> 06:37.797
He was lifting an 80-pound barbell and...

06:37.832 --> 06:40.288
and they think it must have slipped
and crushed his windpipe.

06:45.304 --> 06:49.075
- You okay?
- Uh, the sign in front of that hotel...

06:49.110 --> 06:51.077
they misspelled "Kiwanis."

06:51.112 --> 06:54.672
You mean that sign
five blocks away?

06:54.747 --> 06:56.738
What, you want me to do down there
and have them fix it?

06:56.816 --> 06:58.977
No. No, you don't have to do that.

06:59.051 --> 07:01.576
Maybe we could call them.

07:02.221 --> 07:05.520
There. Sign's fixed.

07:05.591 --> 07:09.425
Ms. Luden, um,
why exactly did you call?

07:09.495 --> 07:12.944
Mr. Monk, I think Elliott was murdered.

07:12.979 --> 07:14.300
Why would you say that?

07:14.335 --> 07:18.031
For the past two years, he and Dexter
Larsen have been threatening each other.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.834
Dexter Larsen? - Dexter Lar...

07:20.907 --> 07:23.276
With-With...With the naked...

07:23.311 --> 07:25.511
Elliott published Sapphire magazine.

07:25.546 --> 07:28.948
He was thinking of shutting it down.
Dexter was pretty angry.

07:28.983 --> 07:32.679
That certainly could be a motive.

07:32.752 --> 07:35.118
Could we look at this private gym?

07:37.590 --> 07:41.093
He was right there.
It was horrible.

07:41.128 --> 07:43.653
The barbell was still on his neck.

07:43.729 --> 07:47.066
Is this exactly the way the room
was when you found him?

07:47.101 --> 07:49.802
Yes, sir. I wouldn't let
the paramedics touch a thing.

07:49.837 --> 07:53.464
Good, good. And he was alone,
and the door was locked?

07:53.499 --> 07:55.114
- That's right.
- From the inside.

07:55.149 --> 07:56.861
That's right.

07:58.744 --> 08:01.144
Hmm. Clock is slow.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.583
Forty minutes.

08:03.618 --> 08:06.177
There's something strange
about this room. - What?

08:06.252 --> 08:10.545
I don't know. I can't put
my finger on it. It's something.

08:11.924 --> 08:15.161
- Is this his briefcase?
- Yes. He always had it with him.

08:15.196 --> 08:17.095
And this floppy was in there.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.393
This was his final recommendation.

08:19.465 --> 08:22.093
What'd it say? - I don't know.

08:22.168 --> 08:26.730
When I tried to open it, it was blank,
like somebody erased it.

08:26.806 --> 08:29.206
Why would they do that?

08:34.447 --> 08:36.347
Oh. That was from last year.

08:36.414 --> 08:40.408
They ran a profile on Elliott
in the magazine. Page 53.

08:43.756 --> 08:45.724
Page 53.

08:52.465 --> 08:54.797
Five-three.
Five-three.

09:03.309 --> 09:05.573
Are you a religious man,
Mr. Monk?

09:05.645 --> 09:07.579
He is now.

09:12.952 --> 09:14.886
Wipe. Wipe.

09:14.954 --> 09:17.013
Wipe. Wipe.

09:18.291 --> 09:20.225
Wipe.

09:20.293 --> 09:23.195
- That assistant, she called you.
- Mm-hmm. Diane Luden.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.803
I gave her your name.
I figured you'd collect a nice payday

09:25.838 --> 09:27.666
after you convinced her she was crazy.

09:27.701 --> 09:30.699
Actually, I think she might
be onto something.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.805
We'd like to look at the official file.

09:32.840 --> 09:35.508
Look, there is no D'Souza case.
It was an accident.

09:35.543 --> 09:37.772
The barbell slipped,
crushed his trachea.

09:37.843 --> 09:40.825
He was alone in his apartment
on the 35th floor. - I know.

09:40.860 --> 09:43.816
There was only one way up. It was a
private elevator. Nobody else used it.

09:43.851 --> 09:46.752
I know. - The apartment
was locked from the inside.

09:46.787 --> 09:50.153
I know. - Are you gonna be
cooperating on this or not?

09:50.222 --> 09:52.391
If you two wanna go
tilting at windmills, be my guests.

09:52.426 --> 09:54.393
But this time, Monk,
you're on your own.

09:54.428 --> 09:56.683
Forget it. Let's go.
What's our first stop?

09:56.718 --> 09:58.489
Sapphire Mansion.
We have an appointment.

09:58.564 --> 10:01.692
Sapphire Mansion?
You have an appointment? - Yes.

10:01.767 --> 10:03.769
Elliott D'Souza controlled
that magazine.

10:03.804 --> 10:06.272
He was about to pull the plug
on Dexter Larsen.

10:06.307 --> 10:08.274
I think Larsen might be involved.

10:08.309 --> 10:10.834
Sapphire Mansion.

10:10.910 --> 10:13.006
I've never been.
Have you ever been?

10:13.041 --> 10:14.869
Once. Ten years ago.

10:14.947 --> 10:18.439
- Did your wife find out?
- Yeah. I told her.

10:18.517 --> 10:20.886
In therapy.
We were playing the honesty game.

10:20.921 --> 10:24.357
Red Roof Inn? - Yep. This was
before they built the new lobby.

10:24.392 --> 10:27.258
You know, Captain, I think Monk
might be onto something here.

10:27.326 --> 10:29.260
Maybe we should tag along.

10:29.328 --> 10:31.990
- Lieutenant, I think you might be right.
- Oh, God.

10:32.064 --> 10:35.465
Hey, I'm married. I'm not dead.

10:53.452 --> 10:56.888
Oh.

10:59.325 --> 11:02.226
Oh.

11:04.563 --> 11:08.795
Wait, wait.! Wait for me.!

11:12.204 --> 11:16.175
Karen? Honey, hi.
I can't make it for lunch today.

11:16.210 --> 11:18.837
Yeah. Something's popped up.
Yeah. It's a homicide.

11:18.911 --> 11:22.081
Pretty nasty business. I...
No, I won't let it bother me.

11:22.116 --> 11:25.050
- I promise. Bye-bye.
- Bethany Daniels.

11:25.117 --> 11:27.563
She was May's Sapphire Girl of the Month.

11:27.598 --> 11:28.951
Not this May. Last May.

11:29.021 --> 11:31.691
- Hi. I'm Bethany.
- Yeah, honey. We know.

11:31.726 --> 11:34.660
So, how's your singing career coming?

11:34.727 --> 11:36.957
Oh, fine. Thank you for asking.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.793
Dexter will be down in a second.

11:39.865 --> 11:42.026
He'd like it if you just
make yourselves comfortable.

11:42.101 --> 11:45.730
And if you feel like unwinding, there's
an indoor pool at the end of the hall.

11:45.805 --> 11:47.796
We didn't...
We didn't bring our suits.

11:47.873 --> 11:50.501
He's new here. - I thought so.

11:50.576 --> 11:53.136
Well, I'll see you around.

11:53.212 --> 11:55.578
- See ya. - Bye.
- Bye-bye.

11:55.648 --> 11:59.607
You can look now. She's gone.

11:59.685 --> 12:02.483
- What's this about?
- That is how Dex got started.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.489
This is his first magazine.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.993
He almost went bankrupt, and then one day
he put Miss Transistor on the cover.

12:08.060 --> 12:11.552
- And voila.
- Voila?

12:11.630 --> 12:15.225
Yeah. He renamed it Sapphire magazine,
dropped all the electronic stuff.

12:15.301 --> 12:19.271
- The rest is history.
- Silicone and air-brushed women?

12:19.306 --> 12:21.933
Well, it's a kind of history.

12:22.007 --> 12:25.534
Oh, gentlemen, I am so sorry
to keep you waiting.

12:25.611 --> 12:29.604
I hope you're not here
to confiscate my Cubans.

12:29.682 --> 12:31.378
Cubano de Oro.
Mmm. Ah!

12:32.451 --> 12:34.582
It's the finest cigar in the world.
Would anybody care for one?

12:34.617 --> 12:36.259
No, thank you.
We're from Homicide.

12:36.294 --> 12:38.456
I'm Captain Stottlemeyer.
I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name.

12:39.328 --> 12:40.960
I'm Dexter Larsen.

12:40.995 --> 12:42.757
Lieutenant Disher. - Hey, Dex.

12:42.828 --> 12:45.296
- Sharona Fleming. Adrian Monk.
- Hi.

12:45.364 --> 12:49.926
"Sharona." That's a beautiful name.
It's from the Bible, isn't it?

12:50.002 --> 12:53.529
- Have you read the Bible?
- Not lately.

12:53.606 --> 12:56.939
- Can I get you gentlemen anything?
- Actually, we're...

12:57.009 --> 13:00.069
We're here to talk about
the death of... of Elliott D'Souza.

13:00.146 --> 13:04.378
Yes. Yes, it's heartbreaking.
I still can't believe it.

13:04.450 --> 13:06.714
Please.! Please.!
Don't touch that.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.889
It's an original Carvasia.
It's worth a hundred thousand dollars.

13:09.924 --> 13:14.193
Mr. Larsen, where...
Where were you on Sunday morning?

13:14.228 --> 13:18.061
Where was I?
Let me show you.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.257
This is it, guys.

13:20.332 --> 13:22.596
This is the room where I get...

13:22.668 --> 13:25.068
99% of my inspiration.

13:25.137 --> 13:28.368
Oh, my God. We're really here.
We're in his bedroom.

13:28.440 --> 13:31.102
Pinch me. - No.

13:31.177 --> 13:33.179
I didn't...
I didn't mean literally pinch me.

13:33.214 --> 13:35.773
It's a figure... - Randy, shut up.
We're done talking about pinching.

13:35.848 --> 13:37.839
You were asking about Sunday.

13:37.917 --> 13:40.283
I was right here, in bed, all morning.

13:40.352 --> 13:43.844
- Where you alone?
- No, Mr. Monk. I had company.

13:43.923 --> 13:46.414
Ah, let's see. Um,

13:47.493 --> 13:49.688
Gwen. No, that was Friday.

13:49.762 --> 13:51.997
Ah, Brianna was...

13:52.032 --> 13:55.455
No. That was also Friday.
Sh... Oh, oh. I remember.

13:55.534 --> 13:59.368
Could you ask Amber
to come upstairs, please.

13:59.438 --> 14:02.208
Mr. Larsen, we understand
that Elliott D'Souza was planning...

14:02.243 --> 14:05.010
to shut down your magazine.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.563
Well, that's not true.

14:06.598 --> 14:08.781
The last time we spoke,
he said he was still undecided.

14:08.816 --> 14:11.545
So, you can relax.
Your magazine's safe.

14:11.617 --> 14:13.949
I'm always relaxed.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.456
Whoa there, cowboy.
Don't hurt yourself.

14:20.526 --> 14:24.053
Lieutenant Disher,

14:24.129 --> 14:26.654
Get off the bed.

14:26.732 --> 14:29.326
Look at that.
There's a mirror above the bed.

14:29.401 --> 14:31.801
Why would he need a mirror
on the ceiling?

14:31.871 --> 14:35.068
Don't think about that now.
Not now.

14:35.140 --> 14:37.710
Gentlemen, this is Amber Post,

14:37.745 --> 14:39.979
our Sapphire Girl of the Month...

14:40.014 --> 14:42.381
and perhaps
our Sapphire Girl of the Year.

14:42.416 --> 14:46.477
Uh, Amber, sweetheart,
these gentlemen are from the police,

14:46.552 --> 14:50.389
and they're wondering where
I was on Sunday morning.

14:50.424 --> 14:52.448
Oh.

14:52.524 --> 14:54.651
Well, would you like me to go into detail?

14:54.727 --> 14:57.696
- Yeah, I think that would be best.
- No! No, no.

14:57.763 --> 15:00.254
No, no. Don't... No details.

15:00.332 --> 15:02.892
Just the big, vague, general picture.

15:02.968 --> 15:08.607
Well, Dexter and I were here...
in bed all morning.

15:08.642 --> 15:12.737
And I remember we woke up
and watched the sunrise together.

15:14.189 --> 15:16.941
And actually we didn't even
leave the room until about noon.

15:17.016 --> 15:19.541
Which is when I got the call
about Elliott.

15:19.618 --> 15:22.849
Oh. Sweetheart, that reminds me.
I found this under your pillow.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.083
My earring.

15:25.157 --> 15:28.494
- I was looking for that.
- Excuse me. You said...

15:28.529 --> 15:31.597
You said you saw the sunrise,

15:31.632 --> 15:36.034
but these windows only
face west and south, so...

15:36.101 --> 15:40.773
Oh, I think what Amber meant to say
was that we saw the dawn breaking together.

15:40.808 --> 15:43.976
We didn't actually see
the sun literally rise, no.

15:44.011 --> 15:46.274
Oh. What I don't understand is,
the earrings...

15:46.345 --> 15:49.542
You know, Mr. Monk, I would love
to answer all of your questions,

15:49.615 --> 15:51.917
but, right now,
I am late for a tee time. - But...

15:51.952 --> 15:55.788
I have a private golf course out back.
Some friends are coming by.

15:55.823 --> 15:57.779
Mr. Monk, do you play golf?

15:57.856 --> 16:00.993
- No, I don't play.
- I play golf.

16:01.028 --> 16:03.655
Lieutenant Disher
does not play golf.

16:03.729 --> 16:06.254
Lieutenant Disher is still on duty.

16:06.332 --> 16:09.460
You play golf, don't you?

16:09.535 --> 16:12.129
- Me? I...
- Yes. You're good.

16:12.204 --> 16:16.041
Don't be modest. She's good.
She's a... She's a... duffer.

16:16.076 --> 16:18.441
You duff.

16:18.510 --> 16:21.680
- Sure. I play.
- Perfect.

16:21.715 --> 16:23.671
Great. - Great.

16:28.387 --> 16:30.480
Well, Sharona.
Look at you.

16:30.556 --> 16:32.891
Sharona Fleming,
this is Shawn Clemmons.

16:32.926 --> 16:35.394
Won the Calico Beach Classic
last week in Santa Barbara.

16:35.429 --> 16:37.862
Hi. - And this is Danny Bonaduce.

16:37.930 --> 16:41.263
Yeah. This is a dream come true
for you. Am I right?

16:41.333 --> 16:43.869
Uh, yeah. Absolutely. Yeah.

16:43.904 --> 16:45.996
Yeah. I like this girl.

16:47.172 --> 16:50.009
Oh, I, uh, see
you brought your caddie.

16:50.044 --> 16:53.604
I hope you don't mind if I tag along.
It's a beautiful day for a walk.

16:56.448 --> 16:59.251
Oh, yeah. Okay, so I lied.

16:59.286 --> 17:01.742
You can play this game.
Very nice. Okay.

17:01.820 --> 17:04.890
Very sweet.
Sharona, you're up next.

17:04.925 --> 17:07.858
Okay. - She makes a nice exit though.

17:07.925 --> 17:11.997
- Give me a three.
- I think we start with one.

17:12.031 --> 17:15.501
No, no, no. It's too much club.
I need a three-wood. Give me a three.

17:15.536 --> 17:19.528
Let's start with the one
and then the two and then the three.

17:19.605 --> 17:21.137
It's better. Just go in order.

17:21.173 --> 17:22.608
You don't know
what you're talking about.

17:22.643 --> 17:24.633
Give me the three.

17:27.880 --> 17:29.982
I c-can't. I can't.

17:30.017 --> 17:32.644
Okay. Give me the one.

17:32.718 --> 17:34.709
Now you're talkin'.

17:36.288 --> 17:39.280
- Give me the two.
- Comin' up.

17:47.800 --> 17:51.930
This is the first club now.
Okay?

17:53.505 --> 17:55.496
Was that so hard? - Yeah.

18:02.214 --> 18:04.614
You called him Sunday morning.

18:06.151 --> 18:09.450
- Pardon me?
- You called Mr. D'Souza.

18:09.521 --> 18:12.115
We checked the records.

18:12.150 --> 18:14.026
Yes. I had a question about business.

18:14.061 --> 18:17.496
From your cell phone? - That's right.

18:17.531 --> 18:19.698
You were in bed all morning.

18:19.733 --> 18:22.292
Well, I have my cell phone
with me at all times.

18:22.367 --> 18:24.562
- It's easier.
- Dex. You're up.

18:24.636 --> 18:26.627
Mr. Monk, if you don't mind.

18:26.705 --> 18:30.209
I-I was also wondering
about that earring. - What earring?

18:30.244 --> 18:32.575
The earring you found in your bed.

18:32.644 --> 18:34.578
You mean the one that Amber lost.

18:34.646 --> 18:37.182
It wasn't Amber's earring.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.984
The earring you found
was for pierced ears.

18:40.019 --> 18:41.820
Her ears aren't pierced.

18:41.855 --> 18:43.689
Why would she lie about that?

18:43.724 --> 18:46.886
An honest mistake, Mr. Monk.
It happens.

18:48.193 --> 18:50.388
Excuse me.

19:00.172 --> 19:02.902
That's game.

19:04.343 --> 19:06.743
I'm glad you were here to see that.

19:06.812 --> 19:09.281
I don't lose.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.840
Call me if you think
of any snappy comebacks.

19:11.917 --> 19:13.908
I'll be inside.

19:16.155 --> 19:20.292
Hey, uh, you know, don't mind Dex.
I've known him for years.

19:20.327 --> 19:23.295
He's got a bit of a temper,
but he's a good guy. Good friend.

19:23.330 --> 19:26.598
Like last Saturday night, at the party,
he wouldn't even let me drive home.

19:26.633 --> 19:29.401
- Were you drunk?
- No. That's the thing.

19:29.436 --> 19:32.704
I only had a couple of beers,
but Dex insisted I stay over.

19:32.739 --> 19:35.589
How could I argue?
He even took my car keys.

19:37.609 --> 19:40.846
Son of a bitch. I told you
to put a new battery in this thing.

19:40.881 --> 19:43.715
- I did. I put a new one in last week.
- Did you check it?

19:43.750 --> 19:47.119
- Of course I checked it.
- Well, it's dead now.

19:47.154 --> 19:49.110
Give me a hand here, will ya?

19:52.658 --> 19:54.660
Oh, hey, can I help you?

19:54.695 --> 19:57.788
Mr. Bonaduce left something in his car.

19:58.797 --> 20:01.561
It's the silver convertible
over there. - Right.

20:01.633 --> 20:03.567
It's unlocked.

20:36.268 --> 20:38.770
Detective, caddie, car thief.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.897
You wear many hats, Mr. Monk.

20:40.973 --> 20:43.771
You, uh...
You looking for something?

20:43.842 --> 20:47.079
Did you drive this car,
Mr. Larsen?

20:47.114 --> 20:49.281
- Maybe Sunday morning?
- Why would you think that?

20:49.316 --> 20:52.985
Somebody was smoking
a cigar in here.

20:53.020 --> 20:55.153
A lot of people smoke cigars,
Mr. Monk.

20:55.188 --> 20:59.258
Right, but the texture and size
of this cigar ash...

20:59.293 --> 21:04.890
are consistent with those
from your precious Cubano de Oros.

21:04.963 --> 21:08.000
- Hmm.
- How did you do it?

21:08.035 --> 21:13.105
You mean how did I, uh, rise from
humble beginnings to achieve all of this?

21:13.140 --> 21:17.309
No. No, I mean how did you
murder Elliott D'Souza?

21:17.344 --> 21:19.777
What are you talking about?

21:19.845 --> 21:22.281
There was no murder.
Elliott was alone.

21:22.316 --> 21:24.749
The door was locked. - Right.

21:26.518 --> 21:29.316
How... did you do it?

21:31.957 --> 21:33.501
You've taken a great interest in me,

21:33.536 --> 21:36.928
and the truth is I've taken
an interest in you too...

21:36.963 --> 21:40.499
and your friend, Sharona.

21:40.534 --> 21:42.490
May I show you something?

21:48.807 --> 21:51.176
My research staff is first-rate.

21:51.211 --> 21:53.667
She must have been 19,
maybe 20.

21:53.745 --> 21:56.748
You know what? Th-That's...
That's my favorite age.

21:56.783 --> 21:59.546
Hungry, with no inhibitions.

21:59.618 --> 22:01.687
These were taken in Atlantic City.

22:01.722 --> 22:04.087
She was using a different name,
but my lawyers assure me...

22:04.156 --> 22:06.692
that the release
that she signed is solid.

22:06.727 --> 22:10.929
- I can publish them anytime I want.
- What kind of man are you?

22:10.964 --> 22:13.532
I told you on the golf course,
Mr. Monk.

22:13.567 --> 22:15.796
I do not lose.

22:15.867 --> 22:20.172
Now, Sharona, she has a son.
How old is he now? - He's 12.

22:20.207 --> 22:22.970
Twelve.

22:23.041 --> 22:26.841
That's an impressionable age.

22:26.912 --> 22:30.848
I think we understand
each other, don't we?

22:30.916 --> 22:33.714
Any more questions
about what happened to Elliott?

22:36.288 --> 22:39.519
- No.
- You can let yourself out.

22:50.001 --> 22:51.662
I told you.

22:51.737 --> 22:55.707
Dexter and I were in bed all night
and all morning.

22:55.742 --> 22:57.732
He never left the room.

22:57.809 --> 23:01.580
Okay. We know it wasn't your earring.
Why did you lie about that?

23:01.615 --> 23:03.741
I thought it was mine.
I made a mistake.

23:03.815 --> 23:06.283
Amber, why are you protecting him?

23:06.351 --> 23:09.488
I wouldn't do that.
I don't lie.

23:09.523 --> 23:12.190
You don't lie, huh?

23:12.225 --> 23:14.559
Well, in your pictorial,
you never mentioned having a kid.

23:14.594 --> 23:16.628
And you said you live on a farm.

23:16.663 --> 23:19.064
Well, this may come as a shock
to you, Lieutenant,

23:19.099 --> 23:23.660
but those profiles,
they're completely made-up.

23:30.909 --> 23:32.037
You okay?

23:34.112 --> 23:36.381
- Oh, she is lying.
- What?

23:36.416 --> 23:38.950
She is covering
for that son of a bitch.

23:38.985 --> 23:40.786
Dexter Larsen is dirty.

23:40.821 --> 23:42.788
There is no doubt about it.

23:42.823 --> 23:45.090
Well,

23:45.125 --> 23:47.159
I don't know.

23:47.194 --> 23:50.856
- You don't know?
- What do you mean you don't know?

23:50.929 --> 23:52.954
I'm thinking it probably
was an accident.

23:53.031 --> 23:55.934
D'Souza was alone.

23:55.969 --> 23:58.960
- Look, the door was locked.
- What about the earring?

23:59.037 --> 24:01.335
- And the threats.
- And the phone call that morning.

24:01.406 --> 24:04.341
I don't think he did it.
I was wrong.

24:05.444 --> 24:09.714
- I was wrong.
- What the hell is going on here?

24:09.749 --> 24:11.875
Nothing. The case is over.

24:11.950 --> 24:15.113
And, uh, I'm gonna return
Ms. Luden's money.

24:16.254 --> 24:18.188
Let's go home.

24:21.893 --> 24:24.963
Hey. Hey, what's goin' on?

24:24.998 --> 24:26.897
What do you mean?

24:26.965 --> 24:29.201
I know you.
You were lying back there.

24:29.236 --> 24:31.203
Listen to me.

24:31.238 --> 24:34.573
It was an accidental death.
I was wrong.

24:34.608 --> 24:38.566
- People change their minds.
- That's true. People do, but you don't.

24:38.643 --> 24:43.444
What happened in that garage?
Was Dexter there?

24:49.054 --> 24:52.046
Did he threaten you?

24:52.123 --> 24:54.435
Adrian, you might as well tell me.

24:54.470 --> 24:56.526
You know I'm never gonna
let this go until you do.

25:00.465 --> 25:03.602
He... He had some pictures.

25:03.637 --> 25:06.972
- What kind of pictures?
- Compromising pictures.

25:07.007 --> 25:11.773
What, he's blackmailing you?
With what? You never did anything.

25:11.843 --> 25:14.778
What, he's got pictures of you with your
shirt not tucked in? That's ridiculous.

25:14.846 --> 25:18.111
- Not of me.
- Well, who then? What, me?

25:22.053 --> 25:25.318
Oh, my God.
From Atlantic City. I...

25:29.127 --> 25:31.925
Adrian.

25:33.999 --> 25:36.768
Benjy was one, and I...
I was just so desperate.

25:36.803 --> 25:41.171
He's gonna publish them...
if we don't walk away.

25:46.845 --> 25:48.836
Did you see them?

25:51.716 --> 25:55.743
What? - Did you see those photos?

26:29.908 --> 26:31.211
No.

26:35.527 --> 26:37.461
Yes.

26:39.798 --> 26:41.323
Oh, my God.

26:42.400 --> 26:45.233
Oh, God.

26:45.303 --> 26:47.372
Talk about an embarrassment of riches.

26:47.407 --> 26:51.109
Once again, we had 12 stunningly
beautiful girls to choose from,

26:51.144 --> 26:54.169
but only one can be
Sapphire Girl of the Year.

26:54.245 --> 26:56.236
Ladies and gentlemen,

26:56.314 --> 26:58.908
the Sapphire Girl of the Year...

27:00.852 --> 27:04.481
Amber Post!

27:04.556 --> 27:08.890
Now, Amber, here is your sapphire
necklace... - All right.!

27:08.960 --> 27:11.360
And...

27:11.429 --> 27:15.763
the keys... to your new Ferrari.

27:21.139 --> 27:23.573
Thank you.

27:31.782 --> 27:33.251
Do we have a plan?

27:33.286 --> 27:36.688
Yeah. The plan is,
we find Dexter Larsen and kill him.

27:36.723 --> 27:38.757
Do we have a Plan "B"?

27:38.792 --> 27:41.526
I told you you didn't have to come.
This is between me and Dexter.

27:41.561 --> 27:44.984
All right. Just... Just don't kill him.
That would be so wrong.

27:46.898 --> 27:49.799
- What-What's he doing?
- He's dancin'.

27:49.868 --> 27:52.637
- I don't think so.
- Excuse me.

27:52.672 --> 27:54.571
Do you know where Dexter is?

27:54.639 --> 27:57.676
- Is... Is he pointing?
- He's dancin'.

27:57.711 --> 27:59.667
I think he's pointing. - Oy.

27:59.744 --> 28:01.974
Are you...
Sir? Are you pointing?

28:02.047 --> 28:04.582
Uh, no? Hello. Yes?

28:04.617 --> 28:06.685
Okay, you know what?
I'm gonna be right back.

28:06.720 --> 28:09.120
Okay. Be careful.
He's dangerous.

28:09.155 --> 28:11.588
Yeah? So am I.

28:17.495 --> 28:19.554
Hey. No horseplay.

28:20.965 --> 28:24.628
- And no diving. No diving.
- Oh. Oh, my God.

28:24.703 --> 28:28.195
Have you seen Dexter? No?

28:35.480 --> 28:37.582
Amber?

28:37.617 --> 28:40.483
Are you okay?

28:42.854 --> 28:45.687
Hi. - Hello.

28:45.757 --> 28:47.987
You wanna take me home?

28:48.059 --> 28:50.929
I can't. I don't have
a driver's license.

28:50.964 --> 28:54.262
I-I mean I have one, technically,
but I hardly ever use it.

28:54.332 --> 28:58.769
I have trouble with the... left turns.

29:00.472 --> 29:04.175
And the right turns. Turning.

29:04.210 --> 29:06.578
And yielding.
Turning and yielding.

29:06.613 --> 29:09.681
Oh, she's beautiful.
How old is she?

29:09.716 --> 29:12.383
She's four. - Beautiful.

29:12.418 --> 29:15.053
You know, it's, like...

29:15.088 --> 29:17.351
I just want her to be proud of me.

29:17.422 --> 29:20.291
You know? - She will be.

29:20.326 --> 29:26.996
- I gotta go.
- Hey, hey. Amber. Amber.

29:27.065 --> 29:30.802
You know, I have a kid too.

29:30.837 --> 29:32.793
And...

29:32.871 --> 29:35.431
Believe me, I've done
some things in my life that...

29:35.507 --> 29:39.277
I pray to God my son
doesn't find out about, you know?

29:39.312 --> 29:41.780
But... we all make mistakes.

29:41.815 --> 29:45.409
The question is, what are you
gonna do about it? Right?

29:56.227 --> 30:01.028
- You sound good.
- You are very kind.

30:01.795 --> 30:05.025
I practice everyday,
but never get any better.

30:05.904 --> 30:08.506
- You havin' fun?
- No.

30:08.541 --> 30:11.441
But you can't go by me.

30:11.509 --> 30:14.706
Well, I'm Noelle.

30:16.815 --> 30:21.085
Now you tell me your name.
That's how it works.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.950
I'm Adrian... Monk.

30:24.155 --> 30:28.259
You can call me Adrian... Monk.

30:28.294 --> 30:30.250
Are you a friend of Dexter's?

30:30.328 --> 30:35.600
I am a ghost of Sapphire Girls past.

30:35.635 --> 30:38.803
What year? - 1985.

30:38.838 --> 30:41.973
If you have any back issues
in your garage? You can look me up.

30:42.008 --> 30:45.534
No. I... I don't have a garage.

30:47.212 --> 30:49.280
It seems like a lifetime ago.

30:49.315 --> 30:53.952
Not... Not that I'm complaining.
Dexter has been very good to me.

30:53.987 --> 30:58.048
He bought me an apartment,
sent me to Europe on a promotional tour.

30:59.290 --> 31:01.281
So, uh, is your wife here?

31:01.359 --> 31:03.293
I'm not married.

31:04.729 --> 31:06.720
You're wearing a ring.

31:08.299 --> 31:12.837
She passed away.
I can't take it off yet.

31:12.872 --> 31:16.074
I'm sorry.
When did she die?

31:16.109 --> 31:18.975
Six years ago.

31:44.836 --> 31:48.840
Sharona Fleming.

31:48.875 --> 31:51.542
What a pleasant surprise.
Come in.

31:51.577 --> 31:55.613
Don't be shy.
That was a joke.

31:55.648 --> 31:58.816
We both know, uh,
you're not shy at all.

31:58.851 --> 32:02.921
Dexter, I just want the pictures
and the negatives. - Yeah, well,

32:02.956 --> 32:06.357
I want to invent the world's
first fully integrated semiconductor,

32:06.392 --> 32:09.460
but we don't always
get what we want.

32:09.495 --> 32:12.497
You like it?
This is my first workbench.

32:12.532 --> 32:14.761
I had them move it here
from Cincinnati.

32:14.832 --> 32:19.166
And that's how I started out.
I was experimenting, tinkering.

32:19.237 --> 32:22.874
I was a nerd,
publishing my little electronics magazine.

32:22.909 --> 32:25.677
I was the kind of guy that...

32:25.712 --> 32:29.380
a woman like you never talked to.

32:29.415 --> 32:31.314
You still are.

32:34.385 --> 32:37.377
If you're here to beg,
you're not off to a very promising start.

32:37.455 --> 32:40.191
And if you're here to threaten me,
you can save your breath,

32:40.226 --> 32:42.591
because that release you
signed is airtight.

32:42.660 --> 32:46.289
I have a kid. - Then keep your friend,
Mr. Monk, out of my face.

32:46.364 --> 32:49.765
Okay, you listen to me,
you twisted, porn-peddling freak.

32:49.834 --> 32:52.170
If you print those pictures,
you're gonna hurt my son.

32:52.205 --> 32:55.298
You hurt my son,
I'm comin' after you.

32:55.373 --> 32:59.243
And I am gonna dedicate
my life to ruining yours.

32:59.278 --> 33:02.007
Yeah, well, take a number.

33:06.784 --> 33:10.521
"Hold me, Adrian,
my darling husband,

33:10.556 --> 33:14.459
"true love's touch so rare a gift.

33:14.494 --> 33:18.029
"How much more precious is your caress,

33:18.064 --> 33:21.032
"who loves so deeply...

33:21.067 --> 33:25.937
"yet fears the warmth
of hand on hand.

33:25.972 --> 33:29.607
"Still, your love is given free...

33:29.642 --> 33:31.802
"only to me,

33:31.876 --> 33:34.436
only to me."

33:37.181 --> 33:40.708
That was... That was
the last poem she ever wrote.

33:45.890 --> 33:48.085
I just wanna go home. - Me too.

33:51.095 --> 33:53.097
Did you find him? - Get him.

33:53.132 --> 33:55.366
- What do you mean?
- Just nail him.

33:55.401 --> 33:57.368
- But what about the pictures?
- Forget the pictures.

33:57.403 --> 34:00.235
Just do whatever you have to do
to nail that son of a bitch.

34:14.118 --> 34:17.178
- My babies.
- Benjy.

34:18.688 --> 34:20.554
We have to talk.

34:20.625 --> 34:22.559
I didn't do anything. - I know.

34:22.627 --> 34:25.755
I know you didn't. I did.

34:28.565 --> 34:32.402
You know how sometimes
you make a mistake and you mess up,

34:32.438 --> 34:34.605
but you know I still love you anyway?

34:34.639 --> 34:39.099
Yeah. - Yeah, well, sometimes
mommies make mistakes too.

34:40.578 --> 34:44.114
And when you were a baby,
I made a very big one.

34:44.150 --> 34:47.641
- What kind of mistake?
- I can't tell you.

34:47.717 --> 34:49.982
- What, did you kill a guy?
- No, I didn't kill anybody.

34:50.054 --> 34:51.987
What...

34:53.757 --> 34:56.893
But somebody took pictures
of me makin' this mistake.

34:56.929 --> 34:59.124
What kind of pictures?

35:01.499 --> 35:04.935
Oh.

35:05.002 --> 35:07.872
Benjy, the reason why
I'm telling you this...

35:07.907 --> 35:09.941
is because we're workin' on a case,

35:09.976 --> 35:13.399
and somebody is threatening to print
these pictures if we don't let him go.

35:14.779 --> 35:17.348
- Is he a bad guy?
- A very bad guy.

35:17.383 --> 35:22.520
Now, I had to tell you this because,
if they ever got published,

35:22.555 --> 35:24.511
you're gonna hear about it in school.

35:26.257 --> 35:28.418
How do you feel about this?

35:30.795 --> 35:32.864
I don't know. - Honey.

35:32.899 --> 35:35.924
I was really trying to make
a better life for us.

35:43.341 --> 35:45.947
Mom, you can't let somebody get away

35:45.982 --> 35:47.801
just because I might have
a bad day at school.

35:53.784 --> 35:56.878
Have I told you how much I love you?

35:56.954 --> 35:59.445
Not since lunch.
You know, I'm missing my show.

36:04.929 --> 36:07.227
One hour.

36:12.637 --> 36:17.141
He was alone.
The door was locked.

36:17.176 --> 36:19.944
- From the inside.
- From the inside.

36:19.979 --> 36:23.281
The phone rings.
He's over here lifting weights.

36:23.316 --> 36:26.784
There's something wrong here.

36:26.819 --> 36:29.187
Something...

36:29.222 --> 36:31.849
is wrong about this room.

36:33.991 --> 36:38.087
I just can't see it. - You will.

36:42.533 --> 36:45.798
Listen. Listen.

36:49.707 --> 36:51.732
Do you hear that?

37:03.988 --> 37:07.253
- Hello.
- Noelle. Do you remember me?

37:07.325 --> 37:11.022
Oh, yeah. From the party.
Uh, Mr. Monk.

37:11.057 --> 37:13.164
- This is my assistant, Sharona.
- Hi.

37:13.199 --> 37:15.724
- Do you mind if we come in?
- Uh, sure.

37:17.735 --> 37:19.971
Well, you'll have
to excuse the mess.

37:20.006 --> 37:22.462
I'm still unpacking from my trip.

37:23.574 --> 37:25.776
Noelle, did you know...

37:25.811 --> 37:29.780
that you were directly below
Elliott D'Souza's apartment?

37:29.815 --> 37:33.818
No. No, I knew he lived
in the building.

37:33.853 --> 37:36.187
At the party,

37:36.222 --> 37:39.223
you mentioned that Dexter Larsen
found this apartment for you.

37:39.258 --> 37:42.454
Yeah, that's right.

37:42.526 --> 37:46.831
- When was that?
- Uh, about a month ago.

37:46.866 --> 37:49.367
- And then he sent you out of town?
- Yeah, that's right.

37:49.402 --> 37:51.802
To London and Paris
on a promotional tour.

37:51.837 --> 37:54.071
So, what's all this about anyway?

37:54.106 --> 37:56.774
- Did you make these?
- What?

37:56.809 --> 37:59.710
These indentations in the carpet.

37:59.745 --> 38:02.780
Uh, maybe. I might have.

38:02.815 --> 38:05.442
Or maybe they came from that chair.

38:09.820 --> 38:12.618
No. No, they're not from the chair.

38:14.525 --> 38:16.652
No.

38:18.095 --> 38:20.996
No.

38:21.065 --> 38:23.033
No.

39:02.006 --> 39:04.642
I'm not allowed to let
anybody else in here. - Just relax.

39:04.677 --> 39:06.644
No. Dex is gonna be so mad at me.

39:06.679 --> 39:09.113
- It's okay. - But it's my job!
- What the hell is goin' on?

39:09.148 --> 39:13.117
Dexter Larsen, that's a warrant,

39:13.152 --> 39:15.419
duly sworn, authorizing us
to search your house.

39:15.454 --> 39:17.722
Dex, I tried to call you.
They've been here an hour.

39:17.757 --> 39:20.224
- They've been looking everywhere.
- Looking for what?

39:20.259 --> 39:25.096
Looking for proof...
that you killed Elliott D'Souza.

39:25.131 --> 39:29.260
Mr. Monk.
Are you serious? You...

39:29.333 --> 39:32.770
My Carvasia.
I told you not to touch that.

39:32.805 --> 39:34.499
Sorry. I'll get it. - No.! No.!

39:34.572 --> 39:38.631
Don't touch it. I'll do it.
It's very valuable.

39:46.784 --> 39:48.718
Is there a problem?

39:49.820 --> 39:52.656
What's wrong? Pick it up.
Can't weigh more than 15 pounds.

39:52.691 --> 39:54.859
All right. What did you do?
Did you glue it down?

39:54.894 --> 39:56.918
Excuse me. If I may?

39:59.830 --> 40:04.290
No, not glued. Your turn.

40:12.643 --> 40:15.980
We found it, Dexter.

40:16.015 --> 40:18.915
- Found what?
- The magnet that you built.

40:20.017 --> 40:24.783
Randy, you can come out now,
unless you're enjoying yourself down there.

40:25.790 --> 40:29.693
- Come on, come on.
- What's this supposed to be?

40:29.728 --> 40:31.862
What, you don't recognize that?

40:31.897 --> 40:35.687
We found it in your workshop.
It had fingerprints all over it.

40:36.437 --> 40:38.135
Go ahead.

40:38.170 --> 40:42.873
I never realized how strong
an electromagnet like that could be.

40:42.908 --> 40:45.309
I'm told that one can lift a car.

40:45.344 --> 40:49.246
With your background in electronics,

40:49.281 --> 40:53.512
building a device like this
was child's play.

40:54.819 --> 40:57.621
You needed a car battery.

40:57.656 --> 41:00.886
You borrowed one from your own
Mercedes the night before the murder.

41:02.827 --> 41:05.529
You couldn't risk
driving one of your own cars,

41:05.564 --> 41:08.293
so you took Mr. Bonaduce's keys
and borrowed his.

41:10.167 --> 41:13.704
And since you had found
Noelle Winters's apartment for her,

41:13.739 --> 41:15.940
you had copies of all her keys.

41:15.975 --> 41:20.644
You knew the apartment was empty
because you had sent Ms. Winters to Europe.

41:20.679 --> 41:23.135
Now you were
where you wanted to be...

41:23.214 --> 41:27.918
directly below Elliott D'Souza's penthouse,
right under his private gym.

41:27.953 --> 41:31.422
You knew Elliott worked out
every morning.

41:31.457 --> 41:35.259
You could hear the weights
clanging through the ceiling.

41:35.294 --> 41:38.854
You phoned him
to make sure he was in position.

41:39.930 --> 41:41.765
And then you killed him...

41:41.800 --> 41:45.030
Without ever setting foot in the room.

41:45.102 --> 41:47.705
That's why the computer disk was
erased and the clock was a little off.

41:47.740 --> 41:50.241
I knew there was
something wrong with that room.

41:50.276 --> 41:52.276
Everything was turned around.

41:52.311 --> 41:57.715
The pens and the stapler,
they were all facing the same way.

41:57.750 --> 42:00.484
All right. So?
I made a magnet. So, what?

42:00.519 --> 42:03.087
I make a lot of things. It's my hobby.
It doesn't prove anything.

42:03.122 --> 42:06.290
I told you. I was here all night
and all morning.

42:06.325 --> 42:08.656
No, you weren't.

42:08.726 --> 42:11.195
It's all right. Go ahead.

42:11.230 --> 42:13.497
He offered to make me
Sapphire Girl of the Year...

42:13.532 --> 42:17.668
if I lied and said that we
were together that morning.

42:17.703 --> 42:19.659
She's willing to testify in court.

42:21.105 --> 42:24.775
Your necklace.

42:24.810 --> 42:27.444
Your Ferrari.

42:27.479 --> 42:30.743
I don't want 'em.
I don't need 'em.

42:34.285 --> 42:37.550
Looks like you picked the wrong
two women to mess with.

42:39.757 --> 42:41.992
Dexter Larsen,

42:42.027 --> 42:46.759
you are under arrest for the premeditated
murder of Elliott D'Souza.

42:46.830 --> 42:49.628
You need to come with me, sir.

43:00.144 --> 43:02.513
Sharona. - What?

43:02.548 --> 43:07.685
I found this in his office.
They're your photos and all the negatives.

43:07.720 --> 43:09.676
You won't have to worry
about them anymore.

43:16.260 --> 43:18.854
Did you look at 'em?

43:19.305 --> 43:25.319
