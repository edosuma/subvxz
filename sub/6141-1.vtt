00:17.059 --> 00:19.268
Ladies and gentlemen...

00:27.277 --> 00:29.195
We're in Moscow
in the Soviet Union,

00:29.279 --> 00:33.282
and this promises to be the most
watched event in boxing history.

00:42.793 --> 00:44.419
I must break you.

00:49.174 --> 00:50.216
Throw your right!

00:50.300 --> 00:52.385
He just will not let him
out of that corner.

00:52.469 --> 00:53.678
Rocky!

00:55.973 --> 00:58.474
Rocky Balboa is
in serious trouble.

00:58.559 --> 00:59.934
He's getting
killed out there.

01:03.105 --> 01:05.815
Drago continuing to
punish Rocky Balboa.

01:08.777 --> 01:11.404
No pain!
No pain.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.324
Rocky's been hit
with bombs.

01:15.576 --> 01:16.951
Rocky's hurt!

01:18.537 --> 01:23.040
Right hand from Drago sends Rocky
Balboa 15 feet across the ring.

01:23.125 --> 01:24.459
And his head's down.

01:25.502 --> 01:26.794
Come on, get up!

01:30.507 --> 01:32.633
It's been
a one-sided fight so far.

01:33.719 --> 01:37.430
And Drago throws a hard right
hand that stuns Rocky Balboa.

01:39.850 --> 01:43.269
They might have to stop this
one before somebody gets killed.

01:48.358 --> 01:51.694
Rocky taking punishment.
He is completely exhausted.

02:04.166 --> 02:07.043
And Balboa goes down again
from a right hand.

02:15.219 --> 02:16.594
Taking punch after punch.

02:16.678 --> 02:18.012
Amazing willpower.

02:22.559 --> 02:26.312
Rocky Balboa's taking Ivan
Drago's best punches so far.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.481
He's cut
and he's bleeding.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.191
All right,
what's happening out there?

02:30.275 --> 02:31.776
I see three of him
out there.

02:32.277 --> 02:34.111
Hit the one in the middle.
Right!

02:34.196 --> 02:35.279
Hit the one in the middle.

02:36.949 --> 02:37.990
The Russian's cut!

02:38.075 --> 02:39.283
Hit him!

02:44.706 --> 02:46.332
Whoa! Get him! Yeah!
Go!

02:54.591 --> 02:56.300
Hits the ground
like a wrestler.

02:56.385 --> 02:57.760
It's a gutter war!

02:57.845 --> 02:59.637
No holds barred in Moscow.

02:59.721 --> 03:03.182
All your strength, all your
power, everything you've got!

03:03.267 --> 03:04.517
Now, this is your
whole life here.

03:05.727 --> 03:08.187
And a big right hand
by Rocky Balboa!

03:13.193 --> 03:15.987
Rocky Balboa has
done the impossible!

03:17.281 --> 03:18.406
Yeah!

03:20.993 --> 03:25.705
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

03:39.887 --> 03:42.722
Man. I never saw nothing like it!

03:42.806 --> 03:44.807
Came through like
the champ you are.

03:45.559 --> 03:50.313
You did yourself and everybody
proud, especially Apollo.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.522
Yo, Tony.

03:51.607 --> 03:53.983
Yeah, what is it, baby?
What do you need?

03:54.067 --> 03:55.818
Get Adrian.

04:08.457 --> 04:09.498
Rocky?

04:09.833 --> 04:12.585
How's everybody
doing out there?

04:12.669 --> 04:15.421
Everybody...
Everything's okay.

04:16.839 --> 04:18.214
What's wrong?

04:20.636 --> 04:21.761
What's wrong?

04:21.845 --> 04:27.183
Remember when Mick said
when he was fighting,

04:27.267 --> 04:31.687
sometimes he'd fight so hard
that he was thinking that

04:32.147 --> 04:37.526
he broke something inside,
and he was gonna die,

04:37.611 --> 04:42.531
and that's what he said, that's
when the angels was pulling on him.

04:44.034 --> 04:46.202
Rocky, you're scaring me.
I don't know...

04:46.286 --> 04:47.328
What's wrong?

04:47.412 --> 04:49.622
Adrian, I can't...

04:49.706 --> 04:50.873
Can't what?

04:53.543 --> 04:55.586
I can't stop my
hands from shaking.

04:59.675 --> 05:01.300
I never felt this thing.

05:01.385 --> 05:02.677
You gotta see a doctor.

05:02.761 --> 05:04.261
No, I...
Right away. Yeah!

05:04.388 --> 05:06.430
No, I just wanna go home.
No.

05:06.515 --> 05:07.932
No.
You can see a doctor.

05:08.016 --> 05:09.308
I'm just tired.

05:11.895 --> 05:13.813
I just wanna go home, Mick.

05:13.897 --> 05:14.939
And I'm just tired.
I just...

05:15.023 --> 05:15.982
Okay.

05:16.066 --> 05:18.442
I just... I just wanna go home, okay?

05:18.527 --> 05:19.527
Okay.

05:21.780 --> 05:22.822
Okay.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.342
Adrian, where's the kid?

05:43.427 --> 05:44.927
I don't know.

05:45.512 --> 05:49.724
I don't see the kid. Where's
the kid? Ain't he here?

05:49.975 --> 05:51.767
Dad! Dad!

05:51.852 --> 05:53.352
There he is! There he is!

05:53.437 --> 05:55.896
Hey, slugger, how you doing?

05:55.981 --> 05:57.773
Say hi to your mom over there. Hi, Mom!

05:57.858 --> 05:58.899
Then I'm forgotten now?

05:58.984 --> 06:01.068
Hi, Uncle Paulie.
Dad, how you feeling?

06:01.153 --> 06:03.070
Well, I got a few new dents.
How you doing in school?

06:03.155 --> 06:05.114
I made the honor roll.
You're beautiful! Home team!

06:05.240 --> 06:06.782
Hi, I'm Sheila Downes,
airport security. Hi.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.159
Welcome home.
If you'll follow me

06:08.243 --> 06:09.410
there's a press
reception inside.

06:10.912 --> 06:13.956
Rocky, how did you feel about
the Russian people in general?

06:14.041 --> 06:16.125
You know, it was very
good. They was great people.

06:16.209 --> 06:19.045
I mean, I didn't understand what
they was speaking all the time,

06:19.129 --> 06:21.255
but I think I understood what
they was meaning, you know?

06:21.339 --> 06:23.299
Mrs. Balboa, did you learn any Russian?

06:23.633 --> 06:24.675
Did I learn...

06:24.760 --> 06:26.552
Yeah, yeah,
she got fluent in vodka.

06:26.636 --> 06:27.636
Hey, yo, Paulie...

06:27.721 --> 06:28.763
Paulie.

06:28.847 --> 06:32.058
Rocky, there are rumors of physical
complications after the fight.

06:32.142 --> 06:33.225
Complications?

06:33.310 --> 06:35.394
No, no,
those were rumors.

06:35.479 --> 06:38.439
He's in perfect
physical condition.

06:39.733 --> 06:41.192
Rocky. Rocky,
a question.

06:41.276 --> 06:44.070
Recently the American Medical
Association recommended

06:44.154 --> 06:45.446
that boxing be banned.

06:45.530 --> 06:46.530
Yeah?

06:46.615 --> 06:47.740
Do you agree
with the doctors?

06:47.824 --> 06:49.825
Yeah, you know, absolutely.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.827
I think that doctors
should never fight. No.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.455
That was a beautiful
answer, champ. That's right.

06:54.539 --> 06:56.290
Doctors should
stay out of the ring.

06:56.374 --> 06:57.750
Doctors should never fight.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.585
They should stay out
of the ring forever.

06:59.669 --> 07:02.254
Rocky Balboa,
the funniest champion ever.

07:02.339 --> 07:05.424
America's own Rocky Balboa.
How are ya? How are ya?

07:05.509 --> 07:07.051
George Washington Duke here,

07:07.135 --> 07:10.763
promoter extraordinaire,
welcoming back Rocky Balboa,

07:10.847 --> 07:13.682
champion of all the Americans
and all of the Russians.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.560
Now, I would like to digress
from the questions a bit

07:16.645 --> 07:19.355
and pose an interesting
proposition to the media.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.274
Everyone in this city,
certainly in the world of sports,

07:22.359 --> 07:24.235
knows my reputation
for promoting

07:24.319 --> 07:25.444
some of
the finest extravaganzas...

07:25.529 --> 07:26.612
I... What...

07:26.696 --> 07:28.197
...in this country.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.616
Well now,
with the press present,

07:30.700 --> 07:32.576
I'd like to ask you,
Rocky Balboa...

07:32.661 --> 07:33.661
Yeah?

07:33.745 --> 07:38.124
...to be the flamboyant, rambunctious
sportsman we know you can be,

07:38.208 --> 07:40.584
and give this man
here, Union Cane,

07:40.669 --> 07:44.296
a chance to challenge you for the
heavyweight championship of the world.

07:44.381 --> 07:47.299
Balboa, I want the opportunity
to take what you got.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.678
Isn't this bad timing to
present a challenger, Duke?

07:50.762 --> 07:52.263
The man just
got off the plane.

07:52.347 --> 07:55.599
Timing is the essence of
life, gentlemen and ladies.

07:55.684 --> 07:59.186
Now, what I have on this
paper is the largest guarantee

07:59.271 --> 08:02.398
ever offered to
a champion on this planet!

08:02.566 --> 08:06.318
I'm talking about a fantastic
international extravaganza,

08:06.403 --> 08:10.239
to be held in Japan, called
"Letting It Go in Tokyo. "

08:11.449 --> 08:13.450
People, ain't it incredible
that only in America

08:13.535 --> 08:15.369
could people like us
rise from oppression,

08:15.453 --> 08:19.707
rise from poverty, to join hands
in this international event?

08:19.791 --> 08:20.875
Only in America!

08:20.959 --> 08:22.042
Excuse me!

08:23.253 --> 08:26.338
Excuse me.
My husband is retired.

08:26.423 --> 08:29.008
He has nothing... He has
nothing more to prove.

08:29.092 --> 08:30.384
Hey, wait a minute!
Wait a minute!

08:30.468 --> 08:33.511
Hey, Rocky, don't you consider
this a public responsibility

08:33.597 --> 08:35.890
to respond now
rather than later?

08:36.265 --> 08:37.390
Respond to the people.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.602
I mean, isn't this a
question of professionalism?

08:39.686 --> 08:41.645
To talk about it now,
not later.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.188
Mind if I heal first?

08:43.273 --> 08:45.608
The whipping you got ain't nothing
like what I got here for you.

08:45.692 --> 08:47.067
So, what in the hell
does this all mean?

08:47.152 --> 08:50.154
No, that isn't enough.
We gotta hear about this now.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.114
Gotta think about that.
So, anyway,

08:52.199 --> 08:56.744
I wanna tell everybody that
the flight over was really nice.

08:57.579 --> 08:58.871
Come on, guys.
We need more!

08:58.955 --> 09:00.915
Adrian, you know,
if you weren't with me,

09:00.999 --> 09:02.583
I never would
have done as good.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.710
You're my Adrian... You're
always there, you know?

09:04.794 --> 09:09.256
And my kid, having you is
like being born all over again.

09:09.424 --> 09:12.259
Come on, what do you say?
Are you gonna retire or not?

09:12.344 --> 09:15.554
Anyway, I'd like... Excuse
me. I'd like to go home now.

09:15.639 --> 09:17.014
Are you gonna give us
something to write?

09:17.140 --> 09:19.058
Thank you very much. I
appreciate it. What do you say?

09:19.476 --> 09:20.559
No.

09:24.105 --> 09:28.067
Don't worry. You'll
get him. You'll get him.

09:48.588 --> 09:50.673
I know.
Really, it's great.

09:52.175 --> 09:55.135
Yo, look at this place.

09:56.054 --> 09:58.097
I swear, I ain't never
leaving this place again,

09:58.181 --> 09:59.181
you know that?

09:59.266 --> 10:02.601
I swear... Hey, would you like to dance?

10:02.686 --> 10:04.603
How about a homecoming
dance with your old man?

10:04.688 --> 10:06.105
No, don't be silly.
It's cold.

10:06.189 --> 10:08.107
Come on. I'll warm you up, young lady.

10:08.191 --> 10:10.776
Come on, have a dance. Hurry
up, the music's almost over.

10:12.988 --> 10:14.071
Do you like the song?

10:14.239 --> 10:15.531
You should rest.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.157
Yeah, I know.
I'm tired. Come on.

10:17.242 --> 10:18.784
Yeah? Well, maybe I'll take you upstairs

10:18.868 --> 10:20.953
and violate you
like a parking meter.

10:21.496 --> 10:22.788
It'll cost you
a quarter.

10:22.872 --> 10:24.331
Yo, Adrian!

10:24.416 --> 10:26.542
Where'd you learn to
talk dirty like that?

10:29.504 --> 10:33.173
Hey, Uncle Paulie, you notice
something strange about Dad?

10:33.717 --> 10:36.260
He just took
a few hard shots.

10:36.344 --> 10:39.596
I think you tell better
jokes than me, Adrian.

10:42.851 --> 10:45.894
Yo, did I hear somebody
call for their old man?

10:45.979 --> 10:47.313
Did you do this?

10:47.397 --> 10:49.565
Hey, it's sleep time,
kid, okay?

10:49.649 --> 10:52.067
Dad, did you know that your
bones grow three times as fast

10:52.152 --> 10:53.277
during the night?

10:53.361 --> 10:56.030
No, I didn't know that, but I
heard something like that once.

10:56.114 --> 10:57.197
Is that me?
Excellent!

10:57.282 --> 10:59.116
Yeah,
that's you.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.451
Now, is that me?
Yeah.

11:00.535 --> 11:02.328
When we was fishing, right?
Yeah, that's when...

11:02.412 --> 11:04.830
That's beautiful.
Look at the tent.

11:04.914 --> 11:08.500
You know, the fish was a
lot bigger, if I recall.

11:08.585 --> 11:11.879
Well, actually, that was a lot smaller.

11:11.963 --> 11:14.173
Now, anyway, come on.
Hit the bed.

11:14.257 --> 11:16.300
It's time for you to get
healthy and everything.

11:16.384 --> 11:17.551
This is great,
how you do this.

11:17.635 --> 11:19.470
I don't know where
you learned this.

11:19.554 --> 11:22.598
It is something, how this
thing comes out of your fingers.

11:23.433 --> 11:24.808
Oh, my God.

11:26.186 --> 11:27.561
Oh, my God.

11:30.273 --> 11:31.565
Who's this?

11:33.276 --> 11:36.612
That's Madame Dupont,
my French teacher.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.280
Really?

11:41.409 --> 11:43.535
Yeah, she looks French, sure.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.954
I wouldn't show this
to your mother,

11:46.039 --> 11:48.540
'cause she don't
understand French too good.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.710
God. Better cover
that one up.

11:51.795 --> 11:53.629
Well, champ,
it's bedtime.

11:54.464 --> 11:56.965
Hey, you know what?
I know some French talk.

11:57.425 --> 11:58.550
Knock, knock.

11:58.635 --> 11:59.635
Who's there?

11:59.719 --> 12:00.886
Madame.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.054
Madame who?

12:02.138 --> 12:03.889
My damn foot's
caught in the door.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.224
That's an old joke.

12:05.308 --> 12:07.935
What do you want from me?
I'm trying. You know?

12:08.019 --> 12:09.978
I don't know all the
good things, you know?

12:10.063 --> 12:12.523
Hey, what's this?

12:12.607 --> 12:13.690
What?

12:14.567 --> 12:16.318
Look what I
found in your ear.

12:16.403 --> 12:18.779
Russian money.
Money ears!

12:19.489 --> 12:22.658
All right. Anyway, listen,
kid, you gotta get some sleep.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.118
Dad?
Yeah?

12:24.494 --> 12:27.371
Today when you said having me
was like being born again...

12:27.455 --> 12:29.373
Yeah?
What did you mean?

12:30.125 --> 12:34.503
Well, you know, when you come
up like I did, and you got like

12:36.005 --> 12:39.633
three square meals of zero
a day, you know what I mean?

12:39.717 --> 12:41.927
You got the A side of life
and the B side of life.

12:42.011 --> 12:45.764
I'm, like, on the B side, but
you, you got all the breaks.

12:45.849 --> 12:50.102
So, when I see you having all
these things that I didn't have,

12:50.186 --> 12:53.355
I, like,
live through your eyes.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.523
I enjoy it a little bit.

12:54.607 --> 12:57.985
It's like having
it all over again.

12:58.069 --> 12:59.361
That's nice.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.739
Hey, look at my face.

13:02.824 --> 13:04.241
Do I look like a raccoon?

13:05.243 --> 13:06.243
A little bit.

13:06.327 --> 13:08.328
Yeah, like Rocky Raccoon?
Yeah, a little bit.

13:08.413 --> 13:10.372
No!
Yeah, you do a little.

13:10.540 --> 13:11.498
Really?

13:11.583 --> 13:15.502
Hey, if you think I look bad, you
ought to see the other guy's knuckles.

13:17.297 --> 13:20.090
Anyway, yo, good night.

13:20.175 --> 13:21.383
Okay, kid?
Night.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.053
Dad?
Yo.

13:26.598 --> 13:27.890
Glad you're home.

13:28.308 --> 13:30.184
Thanks. I appreciate it.

13:30.852 --> 13:32.519
And we'll play tomorrow,
okay?

13:33.271 --> 13:34.938
Maybe you can show me
your English teacher.

13:35.023 --> 13:36.315
She's pretty hot, too.

13:36.399 --> 13:37.983
Nah!
Yeah.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.485
Good night, kid.

13:39.569 --> 13:41.403
You deserve the worst
for what you did.

13:42.572 --> 13:44.656
Paulie, it wasn't your
money. It was Rocky's money.

13:44.741 --> 13:46.492
You gonna be hysterical?
You cost us everything.

13:46.576 --> 13:48.494
That's what I need.
It was a mistake.

13:48.578 --> 13:51.330
You think I thought this
all was gonna happen?

13:51.414 --> 13:53.081
Don't you walk
away from me.

13:53.166 --> 13:55.792
You just gave up
our life!

13:56.252 --> 13:58.587
And you think it's
like some stupid thing?

13:58.671 --> 14:01.340
Paulie! Paulie, do
you know what you did?

14:01.424 --> 14:02.883
Do you know the
seriousness of what you did?

14:02.967 --> 14:04.009
I understand it!

14:04.093 --> 14:05.427
Do you?
Then answer me!

14:05.512 --> 14:07.387
I understand
the whole freaking thing!

14:07.472 --> 14:10.849
I understand it! Your
accountant's the crook, not me!

14:10.934 --> 14:12.643
I did what I
thought was right.

14:12.727 --> 14:14.144
So, now, don't blame me for nothing.

14:14.229 --> 14:16.605
I want to murder the bum
worse than anybody.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.690
Hey, Adrian,
what's wrong?

14:18.775 --> 14:20.359
Look what you done now.

14:20.443 --> 14:21.527
She's dumping
everything on me.

14:21.611 --> 14:23.362
Come on, Paulie. Don't
turn this around on me.

14:23.446 --> 14:24.655
Come on, what'd you do, Paulie?

14:24.739 --> 14:26.198
He gave power...

14:26.282 --> 14:28.242
Power of attorney to
our accountant. What?

14:28.326 --> 14:32.162
Gave... I just didn't gave
anything to nobody, huh?

14:32.247 --> 14:33.330
He sent a letter!

14:33.414 --> 14:35.832
He says we're gonna be in Russia
a couple of months. He says,

14:35.917 --> 14:38.377
"And I need Rocky
to sign a tax extension!"

14:38.461 --> 14:42.214
Not an extension! That was
a power of attorney, Paulie!

14:42.298 --> 14:44.800
He's the thief!
I need alcohol.

14:45.552 --> 14:48.303
Rocky, on my eyes, I never
stole a freaking dime.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.473
Adrian,
what's happening here?

14:52.058 --> 14:53.058
It's gone.

14:53.142 --> 14:54.268
What's gone?

14:54.352 --> 14:55.978
The money.
The money.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.938
Everything.
It's all gone.

14:58.648 --> 15:00.232
The piece of paper
Paulie had you sign

15:00.316 --> 15:03.068
wasn't a request for an
extension on your tax returns.

15:03.152 --> 15:07.155
It was a blanket power of attorney
in favor of the accountant,

15:07.240 --> 15:10.242
who was involved in some very
high-priced commercial real estate.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.411
He thought he could flip
it quick, take his profit,

15:12.495 --> 15:14.538
have your money back
before you knew it was gone.

15:14.622 --> 15:17.416
And unfortunately for you
and everybody in this room,

15:17.500 --> 15:20.252
his deals fell through
because the market dried up.

15:20.336 --> 15:21.878
And you lost millions.

15:21.963 --> 15:23.755
So, what are you saying? There
ain't nothing I can do about it?

15:23.840 --> 15:26.341
I'm doing plenty. I've filed
eight criminal acts against him,

15:26.426 --> 15:29.177
but you've got tremendous debt
payment on this property, Rocky.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.430
You didn't pay your tax
returns in six years,

15:31.514 --> 15:33.724
and the mortgage on your house
hasn't been paid in months.

15:33.808 --> 15:37.269
Wait, we didn't have a mortgage.
Our house was fully paid for.

15:37.353 --> 15:38.812
Don't take it from me.
Ask him.

15:38.896 --> 15:42.608
Apparently not. There's nearly
$400,000 still outstanding.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.484
The only thing you have
that's not encumbered

15:44.569 --> 15:46.528
is a gymnasium that was
willed to your son

15:46.613 --> 15:49.615
by a Mickey Goldmill
in 1982.

15:49.699 --> 15:52.284
You can sell some things.
Remember those commercials you did?

15:52.368 --> 15:54.745
You know, Paulie, I ain't
no commercial kind of guy.

15:54.829 --> 15:56.663
I'm a fighter.
It's what I do for a living.

15:56.748 --> 15:59.249
Nah, it's just as well. We
couldn't get any sponsors.

15:59.334 --> 16:01.293
With the investigation
of the accountant,

16:01.377 --> 16:03.587
out pops a criminal record
of Rocky's for assault

16:03.671 --> 16:05.213
in connection
with loan sharking.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.591
But that was a long time
ago. He didn't know what...

16:07.675 --> 16:09.176
Why not a couple more fights?

16:09.260 --> 16:10.469
With your
popularity right now,

16:10.553 --> 16:12.012
you could be out of
this thing in no time.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.138
No, he's retiring.

16:13.222 --> 16:14.640
Rocko, fighting's the ticket.

16:14.724 --> 16:16.642
I said he's retired!

16:16.726 --> 16:18.560
Paulie, we're here
because of you!

16:19.187 --> 16:21.438
I'm not taking
the heat for all this.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.148
I thought I was
doing smart business.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.233
You thought you
did smart business?

16:25.318 --> 16:26.276
Hey, you...
Me?

16:26.402 --> 16:28.278
What are you talking about me?
The accountant was your choice!

16:28.404 --> 16:29.696
My choice? You should
have known he was a thief,

16:29.781 --> 16:30.781
but you're never awake

16:30.865 --> 16:33.450
because you live in this fairy-tale
world where the air don't move.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.410
Paulie... You're like a
season that don't change!

16:35.495 --> 16:36.828
Hey, you don't
talk to her like this.

16:36.913 --> 16:38.538
I'm not no tomato
can you kick around!

16:38.623 --> 16:39.956
Paulie, no!
Yeah!

16:40.083 --> 16:42.417
You call Duke. You tell
him I'll fight Cane.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.169
I don't care,
anywhere, anytime.

16:44.295 --> 16:45.462
No, Rocky.
If that's what you want,

16:45.546 --> 16:46.672
I'll get on it right away.

16:46.756 --> 16:47.839
No. No.

16:47.924 --> 16:48.924
Rocky, Rocky, please.

16:49.008 --> 16:51.802
We can't go down like this. A couple
of fights, we're out of trouble, Adrian.

16:51.886 --> 16:53.011
Yeah, but you said you wouldn't.

16:53.096 --> 16:54.221
No, I didn't say anything.

16:54.305 --> 16:55.555
Look, did we come
this far to lose it?

16:55.640 --> 16:57.224
Well, you know, you
have to see a doctor.

16:57.308 --> 16:58.684
Adrian, I don't need to see no doctor.

16:58.768 --> 16:59.810
I need to get
a promoter.

16:59.894 --> 17:00.977
Hey, you know, you gotta see a doctor.

17:01.104 --> 17:02.896
If he says it's all right, I'll
support anything you wanna do.

17:02.980 --> 17:04.146
I gotta fight, okay?

17:04.232 --> 17:05.691
I got problems.
I gotta fight.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.318
Will you do it for me?

17:10.613 --> 17:12.239
All right, for you.

17:13.199 --> 17:16.201
Because of the continuous
violent blows to the head,

17:16.285 --> 17:18.453
you've developed a condition
particular to boxers

17:18.538 --> 17:20.872
called cavum
septum pellucidum,

17:20.957 --> 17:24.376
which is a hole in the membrane
separating the ventricles.

17:24.460 --> 17:28.255
The brain's surface neurons in this
area have also been traumatized.

17:28.339 --> 17:30.841
Excuse me, Doctor.
Simply stated, Mr. Balboa,

17:30.925 --> 17:34.052
it means that you've suffered
some damage to the brain.

17:34.137 --> 17:36.054
How long until he recovers?

17:36.139 --> 17:37.764
The effects
are irreversible.

17:39.016 --> 17:42.728
I... Rocky,
you have to retire.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.146
Adrian,
I don't want to retire.

17:44.230 --> 17:45.856
You know, this ain't
the time to retire.

17:45.940 --> 17:48.525
No, not in here,
not in no office.

17:49.152 --> 17:52.904
I just fought the best fight of
my life. I just did that, you know,

17:54.365 --> 17:56.908
and all I need
is a couple more.

17:56.993 --> 17:59.453
No, Rocky, you suffered
severe brain trauma.

17:59.537 --> 18:01.246
Well, he could be wrong.
Anybody could be wrong.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.330
I don't think he is.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.583
He ain't God. Look, Adrian,
only God ain't wrong.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.960
Hey, Rocky,
this is what's good for you.

18:07.044 --> 18:08.754
All I need is
a couple easy ones, right?

18:08.838 --> 18:11.214
Not with the way it is. You
can't get licensed in any state.

18:11.299 --> 18:13.675
He can't get
licensed anyway, Doctor?

18:13.760 --> 18:14.885
That is correct.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.971
Rocky,
do you love me?

18:20.183 --> 18:22.100
Yeah, I love you.
Why you ask that?

18:22.185 --> 18:24.770
Because if you
love somebody,

18:24.854 --> 18:26.938
you live with them,
you live for them.

18:27.023 --> 18:29.065
You don't gamble
with a life.

18:29.150 --> 18:32.110
Rocky, I don't care
about the money. It's you.

18:33.237 --> 18:35.030
That's all that matters.

18:36.657 --> 18:40.702
Please. We'll be okay. We'll be fine.

18:44.624 --> 18:45.874
No one's gotta know...

18:47.919 --> 18:49.044
Uh...

18:51.297 --> 18:53.256
No one has to know,
doctor, right?

18:53.341 --> 18:55.217
It'll be
strictly confidential.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.306
Thank you.

19:20.910 --> 19:23.829
May we hear
our next bid, please?

19:23.913 --> 19:25.163
Are you done?

19:26.374 --> 19:27.499
Sold.

19:30.753 --> 19:33.880
Moving along, ladies and
gentlemen, item number 46.

19:33.965 --> 19:36.258
Hey, kid.
Bike's been sold.

19:37.093 --> 19:39.678
Hey, bike's been sold.
Get off the bike. Come on.

19:43.766 --> 19:47.769
We have an opening bid.
$25,000 is the bid.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.565
Don't worry about it.
We've been down before.

19:51.899 --> 19:53.233
I'll get it all back.

19:53.317 --> 19:55.443
We just gotta stick together,
all right?

19:55.528 --> 19:56.862
Home team.

19:56.946 --> 19:57.946
Yeah, right.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.155
Sold.

19:59.782 --> 20:01.783
Come on, you know,
Mickey used to say

20:01.868 --> 20:04.244
a fight ain't over
till you heard the bell.

20:04.328 --> 20:06.037
We ain't heard
a bell yet, have we?

20:06.122 --> 20:10.083
Rocky Balboa's boxing gloves
from his first heavyweight fight.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.060
Rocky?

20:30.730 --> 20:32.105
Hey, it still fits.

20:35.151 --> 20:37.652
Why you wearing
those clothes?

20:37.737 --> 20:40.739
I was just going through some of
the stuff up there, and I found 'em,

20:40.823 --> 20:43.116
and they feel kind of
comfortable, you know?

20:43.200 --> 20:46.369
Well, I was looking all
over for you downstairs.

20:46.454 --> 20:47.412
It's kind of
depressing.

20:47.496 --> 20:50.206
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

20:50.291 --> 20:53.418
What's this
doing in your ear?

20:53.502 --> 20:54.628
What? Oh, God.

20:54.712 --> 20:56.212
Remember these?

20:56.923 --> 20:58.757
I... Yeah.

20:58.841 --> 21:00.592
Go ahead.
You...

21:00.801 --> 21:01.801
I remember when
you took them off.

21:01.886 --> 21:02.928
That's right.

21:03.012 --> 21:05.847
First time I ever
kissed you, remember?

21:06.140 --> 21:07.349
Kiss me.

21:09.185 --> 21:12.938
Adrian, I want to go out
for a little bit, you know?

21:13.022 --> 21:14.773
Just take a little walk.

21:14.857 --> 21:16.441
I just wanna
feel better, but...

21:16.525 --> 21:19.402
Hey, could you talk to
the kid? 'Cause he's...

21:19.820 --> 21:20.820
He's really taking
this hard, you know?

21:20.905 --> 21:21.988
Sure.

21:22.114 --> 21:23.114
Okay?

21:23.991 --> 21:25.033
Where you going?

21:25.117 --> 21:26.910
I thought I'd go to Andy's.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.790
How you doing, Mick?

23:24.528 --> 23:25.904
Slip the jab.

23:27.865 --> 23:29.324
Slip the jab.
Slip the jab.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.825
Slip the jab,
will ya?

23:32.411 --> 23:33.495
Slip the jab!

23:36.415 --> 23:38.541
That's right.
That's it.

23:38.626 --> 23:40.376
Hey, I didn't
hear no bell!

23:40.461 --> 23:41.669
Okay.

23:42.505 --> 23:43.922
All right. That's right.

23:44.006 --> 23:47.592
Slip the jab.
That's it. Mentalize.

23:47.676 --> 23:49.803
See that bum
in front of you.

23:49.887 --> 23:53.014
You see yourself doing right,
and you do right.

23:54.141 --> 23:56.101
That's pretty.
That's very pretty.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.436
Time!

23:58.521 --> 24:01.940
Come here, Rock. My God,
you're ready, ain't you?

24:02.024 --> 24:03.566
And Apollo won't
know what hit him.

24:03.651 --> 24:07.821
You're gonna roll over him like
a bulldozer, an Italian bulldozer.

24:08.489 --> 24:10.281
You know, kid,
I know how you feel

24:10.366 --> 24:12.367
about this fight
that's coming up.

24:12.785 --> 24:15.120
Because
I was young once, too.

24:16.163 --> 24:17.622
And I tell you something.

24:18.916 --> 24:24.420
Well, if you wasn't here, I
probably wouldn't be alive today.

24:24.964 --> 24:27.048
The fact that you're here

24:27.133 --> 24:29.968
and doing as well
as you're doing gives me,

24:30.052 --> 24:33.721
what do you call it, a
motivization to stay alive?

24:34.348 --> 24:36.933
'Cause I think that
people die sometimes

24:37.017 --> 24:38.560
when they don't
wanna live no more.

24:39.061 --> 24:41.229
"Nature's smarter
than people think. "

24:41.313 --> 24:43.648
And nature is smarter
than people think.

24:43.732 --> 24:46.901
Little by little, we lose our
friends, we lose everything.

24:46.986 --> 24:50.071
We keep losing and
losing till we say,

24:51.073 --> 24:53.158
you know, "What the hell
am I living around here for?

24:53.242 --> 24:55.326
"I got no reason to go on. "

24:56.745 --> 25:01.207
But with you, kid, boy,
I got a reason to go on,

25:02.001 --> 25:06.004
and I'm gonna stay alive, and
I will watch you make good.

25:06.422 --> 25:07.505
"And I'll never leave you. "

25:07.590 --> 25:08.882
And I'll never leave you

25:08.966 --> 25:10.425
until that happens.

25:10.926 --> 25:15.096
'Cause when I leave you, you'll
not only know how to fight,

25:15.931 --> 25:19.184
you'll be able to take care of
yourself outside the ring, too.

25:19.268 --> 25:20.351
Is that okay?

25:20.436 --> 25:21.436
It's okay.

25:22.271 --> 25:23.980
Okay.

25:24.064 --> 25:25.565
Now, I got
a little gift for you.

25:25.649 --> 25:27.525
Mick, you... Now, wait a
minute. Wait a minute now.

25:27.610 --> 25:28.568
Wait a minute.

25:28.652 --> 25:29.819
Really, I don't
need nothing.

25:29.904 --> 25:32.447
Look at this. See that?

25:32.615 --> 25:35.241
This is the favorite thing
that I have on this Earth,

25:36.535 --> 25:39.037
and Rocky Marciano
give me that.

25:39.830 --> 25:41.915
You know what it was?
His cufflink.

25:43.626 --> 25:45.752
And now I'm
giving it to you.

25:47.004 --> 25:49.505
And it is gonna be
like a...

25:50.466 --> 25:53.134
Like an angel on
your shoulder, see?

25:53.928 --> 25:58.640
If you ever get hurt, and you
feel that you're going down,

25:59.558 --> 26:02.685
this little angel is
gonna whisper in your ear.

26:02.770 --> 26:06.606
He's gonna say, "Get
up, you son of a bitch,

26:08.025 --> 26:09.609
"'cause Mickey loves you. "

26:10.319 --> 26:11.402
Okay?

26:13.072 --> 26:14.364
Thanks, Mick.
All right.

26:14.448 --> 26:16.532
I love you, too.

26:17.451 --> 26:18.826
Go after 'em, kid.

26:19.995 --> 26:21.621
Go after 'em.
Thanks.

26:26.460 --> 26:28.002
You was the angel.

26:29.088 --> 26:30.338
There it is.

26:30.798 --> 26:32.257
What happened to
his other cufflink?

26:32.341 --> 26:34.425
I don't know.
He only give me one.

26:35.344 --> 26:37.178
He gave it to some bum.

26:55.698 --> 26:59.534
Take you back Take
you back Take you back

27:00.452 --> 27:02.120
Take you back

27:02.204 --> 27:04.831
From the streets
Cometh a man

27:04.915 --> 27:07.041
A fighter
Doin' the best that I can

27:07.167 --> 27:09.627
To survive Yes, and it's
survival of the fittest

27:09.712 --> 27:12.255
Strive for what is mine
The Lord is my witness

27:12.339 --> 27:14.132
Many believe
in what they see

27:14.216 --> 27:15.174
And I wonder

27:15.259 --> 27:16.426
What do they see in me?

27:16.510 --> 27:19.012
For a man,
he must walk alone

27:19.096 --> 27:20.138
To grow

27:20.222 --> 27:21.472
And to bring
his knowledge home

27:21.557 --> 27:23.891
School of hard knocks
is my alma mater

27:23.976 --> 27:26.269
Lady luck,
you know that I got her

27:26.353 --> 27:27.770
Fame and fortune
never a concern

27:27.855 --> 27:29.314
Don't worry about these.

27:29.398 --> 27:31.065
All right.
Let's go, Paulie.

27:32.026 --> 27:33.901
I really can't believe it.
This kid's taking this too good.

27:34.028 --> 27:35.653
Need a hand, champ?
No, I got it.

27:35.738 --> 27:38.281
Hey, Rock. It's good I
kept the place, right?

27:38.365 --> 27:39.824
How you doing?
It saves money.

27:39.908 --> 27:41.659
Yeah.
Hey, get back.

27:41.744 --> 27:42.744
Right?

27:43.245 --> 27:46.831
A little aluminum on the
front, hey, it's a winner.

27:50.377 --> 27:51.461
Thank you.

27:53.005 --> 27:55.923
Welcome back, Rocky!
We missed ya!

27:57.468 --> 27:59.761
It's only... It's only
temporary, you know?

28:00.512 --> 28:02.055
Come on inside.

28:04.433 --> 28:05.433
Thanks.

28:13.108 --> 28:14.901
Hello?
Mrs. Balboa?

28:14.985 --> 28:16.694
George Washington Duke here.

28:16.779 --> 28:17.862
Yes?

28:17.946 --> 28:19.739
Mrs. Balboa, can you hear it?

28:19.823 --> 28:22.033
Listen close,
you must be able to hear it.

28:23.243 --> 28:24.243
Hear what?

28:24.328 --> 28:25.870
The sound of
the parade going by,

28:25.954 --> 28:28.081
of opportunity knocking.

28:28.165 --> 28:30.249
I mean, what's it gonna take
to get you people to realize

28:30.334 --> 28:33.711
I'm giving you a chance to
pull yourselves together again?

28:33.796 --> 28:36.130
Let me handle your husband's
career and the money will pour in.

28:36.215 --> 28:38.674
You can start living
like human beings again.

28:39.426 --> 28:41.677
Listen, Mr. Duke, we're
living like human beings.

28:41.762 --> 28:43.388
You ought to
try it sometime.

28:44.932 --> 28:46.724
You leave my husband alone.

28:50.437 --> 28:51.604
Women.

28:58.821 --> 29:00.530
When'd you
start that?

29:01.156 --> 29:03.533
I don't know. It's like a
bad habit that comes back.

29:03.617 --> 29:05.034
But, hey, listen.

29:05.119 --> 29:08.246
We ain't talking about me,
we're talking about you, right?

29:08.330 --> 29:09.372
Hey, Rocky,
how you doing, man?

29:09.456 --> 29:10.415
Yo. How you doing?

29:10.499 --> 29:11.833
Good to see you back
in the neighborhood.

29:11.917 --> 29:13.209
Yeah. Thank you.
It's great to be back.

29:13.293 --> 29:14.877
You know, you're
real smart in school,

29:14.962 --> 29:17.130
but you gotta be smart
on the street, too, see?

29:17.214 --> 29:18.423
How do you mean?

29:18.507 --> 29:20.216
Well, you gotta know
who the players are

29:20.300 --> 29:22.135
and, like, who you're
talking to around here.

29:22.219 --> 29:24.595
Watch out for the scammers.
Everybody's gonna try to scam.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.597
What's a scam?
Ask your father.

29:26.682 --> 29:29.142
Well, a scam is
like a hustle.

29:29.643 --> 29:30.601
He don't get it.

29:30.686 --> 29:32.103
Well, you know, like
a hustle's related to...

29:32.187 --> 29:33.312
Rocky?
Yeah?

29:33.397 --> 29:35.106
Rocky, remember me?
I'm Bubba's mother.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.190
Yeah.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.942
You used to use his
head for a punching bag.

29:38.026 --> 29:39.026
Yeah, he had
a nice head.

29:39.111 --> 29:40.278
Welcome back.

29:41.196 --> 29:43.823
So, anyway, like a hustle's
related to a con, you know?

29:43.907 --> 29:45.908
He don't get it.
A deception.

29:46.034 --> 29:47.034
Excuse me?

29:47.119 --> 29:48.202
You're saying
beware of deceptions.

29:48.287 --> 29:50.329
Yeah, that's good.
Absolutely.

29:50.414 --> 29:51.747
You're very smart,
you know?

29:52.916 --> 29:56.502
Hey, ain't this where the
Atomic Hoagie shop used to be?

29:56.587 --> 29:58.421
I'm new here,
Dad.

29:58.714 --> 30:01.007
This neighborhood's coming
down with tooth decay.

30:01.091 --> 30:02.508
It's called
urban blight.

30:02.593 --> 30:03.634
Yeah?

30:04.219 --> 30:07.388
I'll tell you something, this
place is blight new, you know?

30:07.806 --> 30:09.765
I think a little aluminum
siding and some paint,

30:09.850 --> 30:12.018
this place could be okay
again. What do you think?

30:12.102 --> 30:13.978
I don't know. Anyway, we're
gonna be late for school. Come on.

30:14.062 --> 30:16.981
Hey, Paulie, I wanna talk to
the kid private, like, you know,

30:17.065 --> 30:18.107
man to smaller man,
all right?

30:18.192 --> 30:19.400
Right.
Like I got no feelings.

30:19.485 --> 30:20.485
Come on, Paulie.

30:20.569 --> 30:21.694
That's how wars start.

30:21.778 --> 30:23.279
Relax, would you?

30:23.363 --> 30:25.281
So, anyway, you know, everybody's
got an angle, you know?

30:25.365 --> 30:27.325
Yo, tough break, Rock.
Yeah.

30:27.409 --> 30:29.160
Everybody's got
a hustle, you know?

30:29.244 --> 30:30.369
See, like these kids around here,

30:30.454 --> 30:32.038
they got street brains,
you see?

30:32.122 --> 30:33.164
That's how they live.

30:33.248 --> 30:34.707
These kids ain't like...
Listen to me.

30:34.791 --> 30:37.752
They ain't like no personalities
that you growed up with.

30:37.836 --> 30:40.463
So you gotta stay very,
very sharp around here.

30:40.547 --> 30:42.131
I intend to.

30:42.216 --> 30:45.760
"Intend. " You know, sometimes
you make me feel very stupid.

30:46.470 --> 30:48.012
Why?
Why?

30:48.096 --> 30:50.014
'Cause you're smarter
than me, and that's a fact.

30:50.098 --> 30:51.682
No, I'm not.
Yeah, you are.

30:51.767 --> 30:53.851
It's like every day
you learn something new,

30:53.936 --> 30:55.853
and every day I
forget something new,

30:55.938 --> 30:57.688
but listen.
Listen to me.

30:57.773 --> 31:00.399
We're in this thing together,
so if you can figure out any way

31:00.484 --> 31:02.860
on how to fix things up,
don't be afraid to tell me,

31:02.945 --> 31:05.905
'cause we gotta stick
together, 'cause what are we?

31:05.989 --> 31:07.698
What?

31:07.783 --> 31:08.950
What are we?

31:09.701 --> 31:10.952
Oh, oh...
Home team.

31:11.036 --> 31:12.787
Home team! You know, you got that right.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.539
You know, I used to go to
this school when I was a kid.

31:14.623 --> 31:15.623
You know. Nice bricks.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.708
Used to have good milk
at lunch and everything.

31:17.793 --> 31:18.876
It was real tough then,

31:18.961 --> 31:21.587
but I think you can
handle it, don't you think?

31:21.672 --> 31:24.757
No way, you don't even know
what you're talking about.

31:24.841 --> 31:26.759
If you went here,
I can go here.

31:27.844 --> 31:30.179
I'm not scared, really.

31:30.264 --> 31:31.389
Really?

31:32.474 --> 31:34.892
Well, I guess
I'm a little scared.

31:34.977 --> 31:36.352
But that's normal,
don't you think?

31:36.436 --> 31:38.563
Yeah. You know,
I had 72 fights coming up,

31:38.647 --> 31:40.231
and every one of 'em
I was scared.

31:40.315 --> 31:43.734
So, yeah, you know,
that's real, real normal.

31:46.738 --> 31:47.738
I'll see ya later.

31:47.823 --> 31:48.906
Okay, kid.

31:48.991 --> 31:50.408
Here's the front door.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.828
Okay. Hey, wait!
What's this?

31:53.912 --> 31:54.912
What's...

31:56.164 --> 31:57.206
Goodness gracious.

31:57.291 --> 31:58.749
Where'd this come from?

31:58.834 --> 32:01.961
It's a strange place to stash
your lunch money, don't you think?

32:02.045 --> 32:04.255
It's just a lunch joke, you know?

32:04.339 --> 32:05.381
Thanks, Dad.

32:05.465 --> 32:07.383
Okay, listen.
I'll see you later.

32:08.176 --> 32:10.553
Remember, Daddy loves you.
You're number one.

32:10.637 --> 32:11.762
Home team!

32:11.847 --> 32:14.265
Just be nice, right?
You'll be okay.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.935
And don't mess with
nobody's girlfriend.

32:18.020 --> 32:19.562
They don't like
that around here.

32:26.486 --> 32:28.613
You know, Paulie, I'm
really worried about the kid.

32:28.697 --> 32:30.448
You know, he ain't
used to living like this.

32:30.532 --> 32:32.283
He don't know
the streets or nothing.

32:32.367 --> 32:34.952
And that school, I know
exactly what's gonna happen.

32:35.037 --> 32:37.997
Some wise guy's gonna come
up to him 'cause he's my kid.

32:38.081 --> 32:40.124
He's just gonna come out
and try to bang him out,

32:40.208 --> 32:43.127
give him a cheap shot,
you know? I mean... Jeez.

32:43.211 --> 32:44.295
Mr. Balboa?
Yeah?

32:44.379 --> 32:45.504
How you doing?
My name's Tommy Gunn.

32:45.589 --> 32:46.672
Yeah, how
you doing?

32:46.757 --> 32:48.591
Well, with a name like that,
you better be tough.

32:48.675 --> 32:50.301
Yeah, very true.
It ain't easy.

32:50.385 --> 32:51.761
Anyway, I come
from Oklahoma.

32:51.845 --> 32:52.845
Welcome.

32:52.929 --> 32:54.138
I have an amateur's
record of 45-to-one.

32:54.222 --> 32:56.223
And I turned pro at 18,
and I had eight fights.

32:56.308 --> 32:58.100
You're a fighter?
Yeah, I'm a fighter.

32:58.185 --> 33:01.062
And now that I'm 20, I'd just
like to show you what I got.

33:01.188 --> 33:02.980
Well, I... I mean, I've
saved up about 400 bucks.

33:03.065 --> 33:04.482
Mr. Rocky Balboa. I could
pay you for training.

33:04.566 --> 33:05.608
Yeah... What?

33:05.692 --> 33:07.401
Excuse me, young man,
I have some business here.

33:07.486 --> 33:08.653
What, is he lost or what?
Thank you.

33:08.737 --> 33:09.945
Good to see you again,
friend. How you doing?

33:10.030 --> 33:10.988
Yeah. How you doing?

33:11.073 --> 33:12.657
My health is fine. What
more could a man ask for?

33:12.741 --> 33:13.699
Money and hair.

33:13.784 --> 33:14.992
Listen, I gotta
go to work now.

33:15.077 --> 33:16.160
What? Where? Here? In a sweatbox?

33:16.244 --> 33:17.244
Yeah.

33:17.329 --> 33:18.454
Can't be good
for the image.

33:18.538 --> 33:19.955
Urban light.
What are you gonna do?

33:20.040 --> 33:21.499
Hey, Rocky, Rocky...
What'd you say?

33:21.583 --> 33:23.584
Urban light. It's
"blight. " Urban blight.

33:23.710 --> 33:24.835
Rock, George would
like you to consider

33:24.920 --> 33:26.253
putting on those
damn gloves again.

33:26.338 --> 33:28.005
It's a hell of
a payday.

33:28.090 --> 33:29.507
Well, you know,
I'm officially expired.

33:29.591 --> 33:30.966
No, you do have
marquee value.

33:31.051 --> 33:32.843
You put butts in the
buckets, asses in the seats.

33:32.928 --> 33:34.512
A businessman with
any sort of brain

33:34.596 --> 33:36.847
don't retire when he can
still pull in the bread, baby.

33:36.932 --> 33:39.058
'Cause only in America do we
get these kind of opportunities.

33:39.142 --> 33:41.477
Union Cane's going for
the title on the 14th.

33:41.561 --> 33:43.187
Yeah, here's some
tickets. Be our guests.

33:43.271 --> 33:44.397
We have a strong
feeling about this one.

33:44.481 --> 33:45.606
Think he's gonna take it.

33:45.691 --> 33:46.857
That's the time
to challenge.

33:46.942 --> 33:48.984
Because people
love comebacks,

33:49.069 --> 33:51.362
and there's nothing in the
boxing business more commercial

33:51.446 --> 33:52.697
than a long-shot comeback

33:52.781 --> 33:55.157
of a down-on-his-luck,
pure snow-white underdog.

33:55.242 --> 33:56.867
Now, like your
Mark Twain once said,

33:56.952 --> 33:59.412
"Virtue has never been
as respectable as money. "

33:59.496 --> 34:00.955
Who's Twain?
He was a painter.

34:01.039 --> 34:03.666
Look, simply put,
you're the great white hope.

34:03.750 --> 34:04.792
You mean great white dope.
No, forget it.

34:04.876 --> 34:05.876
No, no,
Rock, Rock...

34:05.961 --> 34:07.044
I ain't emotionally
involved in boxing...

34:07.129 --> 34:08.963
Hey, hold it.
Hold the bullshit.

34:09.047 --> 34:11.047
I know what the problem is.
You think I was born yesterday?

34:11.132 --> 34:12.425
Merlin, show him
the paper.

34:12.509 --> 34:14.217
What paper? Now, this
is your medical report.

34:14.302 --> 34:16.344
It's not so good, but
we can work around it.

34:16.429 --> 34:17.388
Where'd you get this?

34:17.472 --> 34:18.723
It really doesn't matter,
does it, Rock?

34:18.806 --> 34:20.725
You agree to fight Cane,
and George here can guarantee

34:20.809 --> 34:22.268
you get licensed in any
country around the world.

34:22.351 --> 34:23.978
Guaranteed.
You can do this?

34:24.062 --> 34:25.062
No problem.

34:25.147 --> 34:27.022
His comeback's in the bag
and worth millions.

34:27.107 --> 34:29.483
The time is hot, the
deal is hot. Caliente!

34:29.568 --> 34:31.360
We could use one more payday. I agree!

34:31.445 --> 34:32.695
Adrian, where'd
you come from?

34:32.779 --> 34:33.946
What do you
think you're going?

34:34.030 --> 34:36.197
Mrs. Balboa just appeared.
This woman is magic.

34:36.283 --> 34:37.742
Look, I don't think
you're very funny.

34:37.826 --> 34:39.702
Are you trying to talk my
husband into fighting again?

34:39.786 --> 34:41.328
We're talking business,
now, darling.

34:41.413 --> 34:43.330
Do you like feeling hard up?

34:43.415 --> 34:46.041
Do you like reaching in your
pocket and only feeling your leg?

34:46.126 --> 34:48.085
Well, do you?
I didn't think so.

34:48.170 --> 34:50.295
I'm offering you your
last golden opportunity

34:50.380 --> 34:51.672
to dump this loser image.

34:51.757 --> 34:52.965
Who you talking to?

34:53.049 --> 34:54.341
Hey, Adrian, you
weren't working across...

34:54.426 --> 34:57.553
Hey, what the hell are you
two people talking about?

34:57.637 --> 34:59.138
This is
a tremendous opportunity.

34:59.222 --> 35:00.681
Opportunity for who?

35:00.766 --> 35:03.309
For you to make money?
For him to be disabled?

35:03.393 --> 35:05.811
What would you do if the
choices were reversed?

35:06.229 --> 35:08.022
You have to
think about that.

35:08.690 --> 35:11.025
Rocky, they don't
care about you.

35:11.943 --> 35:14.111
You want to get serious?
Let's get serious.

35:14.196 --> 35:16.781
You represent the dreams of the
long shots, the little people.

35:16.865 --> 35:18.407
The never-wills
identify with you,

35:18.492 --> 35:20.451
and identification is
the key to public success.

35:20.535 --> 35:23.454
You're a true champion, a true
product of the people. Now sell it.

35:23.538 --> 35:25.331
Sell it while
there are still buyers.

35:25.415 --> 35:26.415
They ain't
gonna last forever.

35:26.500 --> 35:27.583
You say you're a fighter?
Then fight!

35:27.667 --> 35:29.585
You say you want a
champion's do, then do it

35:29.669 --> 35:32.296
and I'll make you so much
money you could swim in it!

35:32.380 --> 35:34.006
You can swim,
can't you, darling?

35:34.090 --> 35:35.674
What do you say?
Come on. Put it there.

35:35.759 --> 35:37.468
It's time to put some hustle
behind this muscle.

35:37.552 --> 35:40.471
He's done!
He's done fighting!

35:47.646 --> 35:49.897
You're a damn fool.

35:51.358 --> 35:54.318
Maybe we ought to sign Mrs.
Balboa to fight Cane, huh?

35:54.402 --> 35:57.446
Looks like she's the one with
the cojones in the family.

36:00.075 --> 36:03.202
Yo, you don't talk like that
in front of my wife, you know?

36:03.286 --> 36:05.204
That ain't no
park bench, boy.

36:09.292 --> 36:10.626
I'll get him.

36:10.710 --> 36:13.087
Rocky, I'm really sorry.
I didn't wanna...

36:13.171 --> 36:15.089
Hey, you guys
want privacy now?

36:15.173 --> 36:16.298
I'll be upstairs.

36:20.303 --> 36:21.387
Rocky...

36:22.764 --> 36:24.932
Rocky, I'm sorry.
I... I...

36:25.016 --> 36:28.477
But, you know, it just takes one
bad hit, and you could be an invalid.

36:28.562 --> 36:30.437
Well, I feel like
an invalid already, Adrian.

36:30.522 --> 36:31.689
Why'd you gotta
come back here?

36:31.773 --> 36:33.482
You're too smart
for this place here.

36:33.567 --> 36:35.192
I got nothing to do.

36:35.277 --> 36:37.027
Gloria. I called Gloria.

36:37.112 --> 36:39.697
She said, you know, she
could use some part-time help.

36:39.781 --> 36:41.282
Yeah, but why do you
wanna do this, Adrian?

36:41.366 --> 36:43.492
Why do you wanna go back to
the same place you started from?

36:43.577 --> 36:45.578
I gotta do it,
but you don't gotta do it!

36:45.662 --> 36:49.123
I wanted to be there so
I could be close to you.

36:58.508 --> 37:00.050
All right. Yeah.

37:00.135 --> 37:02.303
You know, it's getting a
little cold out here. Maybe...

37:02.387 --> 37:04.096
Okay. Maybe you
better get inside, okay?

37:04.180 --> 37:05.222
I understand.

37:05.307 --> 37:07.099
Are you all right?
What?

37:07.183 --> 37:08.183
Are you all right?

37:08.268 --> 37:09.894
Yeah, I'm all right.
I'm fine.

37:09.978 --> 37:11.729
Hey, it's getting cold, okay?

37:17.986 --> 37:21.780
Yo, Adrian!
Did we ever leave this place?

37:24.576 --> 37:26.327
I don't know!

37:31.833 --> 37:33.626
Hey, mind if I
talk to you now?

37:34.794 --> 37:37.087
My head's
a little busy right now.

37:49.059 --> 37:50.267
George, I don't know
if you're gonna get him.

37:50.352 --> 37:52.061
This guy, Balboa, he don't
think straight anymore.

37:52.145 --> 37:54.063
None of these bums think straight,
but all I need is an angle.

37:54.189 --> 37:55.940
I'll fight Balboa right now. Hey...

37:56.024 --> 37:57.441
I'm better than
Balboa ever was.

37:57.525 --> 37:58.859
Hey, hey!

38:00.362 --> 38:03.322
I own the paper on you, boy.
You will fight who I tell you,

38:03.406 --> 38:06.367
where I tell you, and how
I tell you, you got that?

38:07.827 --> 38:10.371
Don't aggravate the
hand that feeds you, huh?

38:10.538 --> 38:11.538
All right?

38:14.167 --> 38:16.210
None of these bums
think straight.

38:20.882 --> 38:22.383
All I need is a hook.

38:34.229 --> 38:36.355
Hey, ain't you Rocky's kid?

38:37.065 --> 38:38.107
Yeah, you're
Rocky's kid.

38:38.191 --> 38:39.358
You're Rocky's
kid, right?

38:39.442 --> 38:40.484
Yeah, how you doing?

38:40.568 --> 38:42.069
Yeah, I seen your
picture in the paper.

38:42.153 --> 38:43.320
And you know what?

38:43.405 --> 38:45.072
Your old man's a punk.
What?

38:47.200 --> 38:48.242
Get off me!

38:48.326 --> 38:50.202
And what are you
wearing my coat for?

38:50.286 --> 38:51.495
Just leave him alone!

38:51.579 --> 38:52.997
You want a beating too?

38:53.081 --> 38:55.332
Give me my coat! I'm not
kidding around anymore!

38:55.417 --> 38:57.084
You better let him have it.
No way!

39:03.717 --> 39:05.426
Don't get sick now!

39:06.052 --> 39:08.429
Hope you don't
catch cold, rich boy!

39:11.850 --> 39:13.350
Keep it high.
Slipping and sliding.

39:13.435 --> 39:15.352
Slip the jab.
That's it. Come on.

39:15.437 --> 39:16.603
That don't interest you?
This cup?

39:16.688 --> 39:18.939
Rocky drinks out of it
around the house. Ten bucks.

39:19.024 --> 39:20.816
Well, hey, man. How I
know it's the real thing?

39:20.900 --> 39:22.526
Look at the
lip marks, huh?

39:22.610 --> 39:24.486
All right, five bucks.
Five bucks. No more.

39:24.571 --> 39:25.988
You got a deal.
Okay.

39:26.948 --> 39:27.948
Excuse me.

39:28.033 --> 39:29.033
Tommy Gunn!

39:29.117 --> 39:30.367
Is there
someplace I can change?

39:30.452 --> 39:31.952
In there.
Give me the money.

39:32.037 --> 39:35.080
Time! Hey, Richard, Richard,
good friend, listen to me.

39:35.165 --> 39:37.708
If you wanna survive, you gotta
learn to slip the jab, you know?

39:37.792 --> 39:40.669
Keep it high, and hit
and not get hit, you know?

39:40.754 --> 39:41.962
Okay, take off.

39:42.047 --> 39:43.130
Rocko?
Yeah?

39:43.214 --> 39:45.049
Remember Tommy Gunn?
Yeah, yeah.

39:45.133 --> 39:47.676
He says he wants to fight.
I told him to get married.

39:47.761 --> 39:48.844
Why?

39:49.471 --> 39:51.013
That's gym humor, Rocko.

39:51.097 --> 39:52.931
That... Okay.

39:53.349 --> 39:55.642
Hey, let's see what
you got there, kid.

39:56.436 --> 39:57.811
Get married, eh?

39:58.438 --> 40:00.731
Benson,
wanna move a little?

40:00.815 --> 40:01.815
Yeah, all right.

40:01.900 --> 40:03.192
Hey, Paulie,

40:03.276 --> 40:04.818
what's a cojones?

40:05.528 --> 40:10.574
Cojones? Cojones is
Latin for Spanish nuts.

40:10.658 --> 40:11.742
Yo, Rock.

40:11.826 --> 40:13.660
We're ready.
Wonderful.

40:15.163 --> 40:17.956
Hey kid,
you got the headgear?

40:18.041 --> 40:20.084
Nah, I don't
need one. Nah.

40:21.628 --> 40:23.921
He's gonna get his
cojones knocked out.

40:24.464 --> 40:26.256
Okay. Ready, guy?

40:26.341 --> 40:28.634
Benson, go easy, all right?

40:28.718 --> 40:30.636
Sure. Okay, Rock.
Time.

40:31.554 --> 40:34.014
All right.
Just go easy now.

40:34.099 --> 40:35.766
Slip the jab now.

40:37.602 --> 40:38.602
Go easy.

40:38.686 --> 40:39.770
Hey, kid.
What's his name again?

40:39.854 --> 40:41.438
Tommy Gunn.
Tommy Gunn.

40:41.523 --> 40:44.566
Tommy. Whoa!
It ain't no law to duck.

40:44.651 --> 40:45.651
That's it.

40:45.735 --> 40:47.152
Go side to side.
That's it.

40:47.403 --> 40:50.447
Whoa! All right,
that's enough.

40:50.532 --> 40:52.282
Hey, man!
Take it easy, man!

40:52.367 --> 40:53.909
Hey, come on,
you guys, lighten up.

40:53.993 --> 40:55.953
It's called sparring.
Now, go on easy.

40:56.037 --> 40:57.496
Whoa! Hey, hey!

40:57.580 --> 40:59.123
Okay, okay.

40:59.207 --> 41:01.291
Hey, lighten up!
That's it. Tie him up.

41:01.376 --> 41:02.668
That's it.
You smell that, Rocko?

41:02.710 --> 41:04.586
What's that? That's
the odor of opportunity.

41:04.671 --> 41:06.088
Hey, that's it.

41:06.172 --> 41:07.965
What'd I tell you?
Hey, hey! Time!

41:08.049 --> 41:09.883
Hey, that's it! Time!

41:09.968 --> 41:11.385
Chill out, man!
Call time!

41:11.469 --> 41:13.428
Time!
Hey! Hey, back off!

41:13.513 --> 41:15.973
Hey, that's enough!
What's the matter with you?

41:16.057 --> 41:17.558
Tommy, are you crazy
or something?

41:17.642 --> 41:19.059
Hey, what's
the matter with you, man?

41:19.144 --> 41:20.561
Get out of the ring.
I'm sorry.

41:20.645 --> 41:21.645
Get out of the ring.
Cool off, kid.

41:21.729 --> 41:23.021
All right.
I'm sorry about this.

41:23.106 --> 41:25.065
He stinks of opportunity,
Rocko.

41:25.400 --> 41:26.650
Hey, look.

41:26.734 --> 41:28.986
Going easy don't mean
breaking bones, kid.

41:29.070 --> 41:30.654
Man, I'm sorry.
But what do you think?

41:30.738 --> 41:33.323
What do I think? I don't
think you listen too good.

41:33.408 --> 41:36.160
But you, you fight, you brawl
like you was a street fighter,

41:36.244 --> 41:37.452
and I know
something about that.

41:37.537 --> 41:40.414
But this is called boxing.
This ain't no mugging, you know?

41:40.498 --> 41:42.166
I'm sorry. But I know I can do it all.

41:42.250 --> 41:44.418
Yeah? Well, not
on this date, okay?

41:45.461 --> 41:46.545
That's it?

41:46.629 --> 41:48.547
Hey, yo, I gotta work
with these kids here.

41:48.631 --> 41:50.007
You guys get ready.
Come on, one more.

41:50.091 --> 41:51.466
How about you
try to manage me?

41:51.551 --> 41:52.551
Manage?

41:52.635 --> 41:56.263
Yeah, unless you think
I ain't got nothing going.

41:56.347 --> 41:57.973
Man, got nothing going?

41:58.057 --> 42:00.642
Yeah, all right, you got a lot
going. You got a lot of tools.

42:00.727 --> 42:03.353
But I ain't no manager.
I ain't never been...

42:03.438 --> 42:05.355
You know, the gentleman
that owned this place,

42:05.440 --> 42:06.523
that was a manager.

42:06.608 --> 42:10.611
But, me,
I was always the managed guy.

42:11.279 --> 42:13.614
Hey, look.
Good luck, all right?

42:16.367 --> 42:17.826
All right, guys.
Let's go.

42:18.870 --> 42:20.078
Come on,
move around.

42:22.123 --> 42:23.874
That's it. Nice.

42:36.846 --> 42:38.305
All right, you guys, come on.

42:38.389 --> 42:40.140
No cheap shots.
Move it around.

42:47.732 --> 42:49.233
How you doing?

42:50.109 --> 42:52.653
Cold? You look cold.

42:53.655 --> 42:56.240
I guess it has something
to do with the weather.

42:57.992 --> 42:59.701
Here, take my coat.

43:00.370 --> 43:03.789
No, thanks.
Where's your boyfriend?

43:04.332 --> 43:07.334
Him. Forget it. He ain't got no manners.

43:09.087 --> 43:11.421
I'm Jewel,
if you wanna know.

43:13.174 --> 43:15.259
I'm Robert.

43:15.343 --> 43:16.593
Hi.

43:17.887 --> 43:20.514
Well, I been living here
about six years now.

43:21.516 --> 43:23.725
It ain't Disneyland.

43:23.810 --> 43:25.352
You been to Disneyland?

43:25.436 --> 43:26.561
Sure.

43:26.688 --> 43:29.231
You make it sound
like everybody has.

43:29.607 --> 43:31.441
I know you can't tell
by the way I look,

43:31.526 --> 43:34.069
but I ain't like the
other kids around here.

43:35.071 --> 43:37.864
Why? I mean, what
makes you so different?

43:37.949 --> 43:38.991
I don't know.

43:39.075 --> 43:40.117
I guess it's
'cause I wanna get out.

43:40.201 --> 43:41.994
You know how it is.

43:43.788 --> 43:48.583
You know, for an Italian kid,
you ain't got a bad butt.

43:50.169 --> 43:51.712
Shut up, man.
Let's go. Come on.

43:57.635 --> 43:59.970
First money I get,
I'm going to Miami.

44:00.054 --> 44:01.305
Why Miami?

44:01.389 --> 44:03.223
Miami needs
new gigolos.

44:03.308 --> 44:05.475
Yeah, I read
something like that.

44:05.935 --> 44:07.102
Ow.

44:08.730 --> 44:10.230
My back is getting bad.

44:10.315 --> 44:12.274
How come you
don't have arthritis?

44:12.358 --> 44:13.483
Yo, ain't I got enough?

44:13.568 --> 44:15.235
Hey,
watch where you're going.

44:15.320 --> 44:17.112
Adrian's too good for this.

44:18.364 --> 44:20.657
This place is really depressing,
Paulie, you know? It's...

44:20.742 --> 44:21.742
Yo, Rock,
come inside.

44:21.826 --> 44:23.869
Everybody's been asking
for you. You too, Paulie.

44:23.953 --> 44:25.620
Hey, no, thanks.
I'm a little beat.

44:25.705 --> 44:27.247
I'm a little thirsty.

44:27.332 --> 44:28.498
Hey, you go if you want to, Paulie.

44:28.583 --> 44:29.541
Mr. Balboa?

44:29.625 --> 44:31.293
Look at this.
Tommy Gunn.

44:31.377 --> 44:32.961
Yo, why you still
hanging around, kid?

44:33.046 --> 44:35.005
Is there something
I can do for you?

44:35.089 --> 44:37.424
Yeah. I'd like
to try again.

44:38.051 --> 44:39.926
Hey, kid, you know,
I'd like to help you out,

44:40.011 --> 44:42.095
but I really don't know
nothing about no managing.

44:42.180 --> 44:43.680
All I'm asking
for is a chance.

44:43.765 --> 44:45.349
Man, if I screw up or do
something you don't like,

44:45.433 --> 44:47.142
man, you don't have to throw
me out. Hell, I'll leave.

44:47.226 --> 44:48.352
What have you
got to lose?

44:48.436 --> 44:50.228
Me? Nothing. I ain't
got nothing to lose.

44:50.313 --> 44:51.355
It's what you got to lose.

44:51.439 --> 44:52.814
And I got nothing to lose.

44:52.899 --> 44:54.024
Maybe you do. Like, look,

44:54.108 --> 44:55.484
what if I don't
do good, right?

44:55.568 --> 44:57.402
You know,
and you don't make it?

44:57.487 --> 45:00.655
I don't want you blaming me
for this, kid, you know?

45:00.740 --> 45:02.366
You know, here's what
I would do if I was you.

45:02.450 --> 45:03.450
No, listen to me.

45:03.534 --> 45:05.535
If I was you,
here's what I would do.

45:05.620 --> 45:08.288
I would go home, and I'd
talk to your family people.

45:08.373 --> 45:10.207
Maybe you could come up with
something better, you know?

45:10.291 --> 45:11.708
I got no family people.

45:11.793 --> 45:13.668
Man, all I got is
what you see here.

45:13.753 --> 45:14.920
Man, I know everything about you

45:15.004 --> 45:17.130
from back when you had your
first fight with Apollo Creed.

45:17.256 --> 45:18.882
Yeah. I read how nobody cared about you,

45:18.966 --> 45:20.509
how no one ever
gave you a chance.

45:20.593 --> 45:22.552
And I realize I don't come
from the same streets as you do,

45:22.637 --> 45:24.513
but I'm hungry
like you were.

45:24.597 --> 45:25.847
And ever since
I put on gloves,

45:25.932 --> 45:27.140
I've been
waiting to meet you,

45:27.225 --> 45:30.310
'cause I knew that if anybody
could make me a winner, it was you.

45:31.229 --> 45:34.564
Winner. Hey, Paulie, you
see a winner standing here?

45:34.649 --> 45:36.525
Yes! Man,
you beat the best!

45:36.609 --> 45:38.276
Nobody could ever
say any different.

45:38.361 --> 45:40.278
Look, Rock,
you don't know me,

45:40.363 --> 45:42.531
but anything you want me to do, I'll do.

45:42.615 --> 45:45.158
And if I can't,
I'll bust my butt trying.

45:45.243 --> 45:46.618
Man, I'm not
hustling you, man.

45:46.702 --> 45:48.703
All I'm asking
for is a chance.

45:48.788 --> 45:50.247
Man, just one shot.

46:01.092 --> 46:02.676
Are you hungry?

46:04.846 --> 46:06.221
Yeah.

46:06.305 --> 46:07.431
Yeah?

46:08.182 --> 46:09.391
Come on.

46:09.851 --> 46:12.394
You're really gonna like the
way Adrian cooks, you know.

46:12.478 --> 46:15.188
She does, like, amazing
things with macaroni,

46:15.273 --> 46:16.314
especially tomatoes.

46:16.399 --> 46:17.899
But I gotta warn you.

46:17.984 --> 46:20.026
She can be a little
vicious with the garlic.

46:22.697 --> 46:25.198
So, why'd this kid
smack your face for?

46:25.283 --> 46:26.741
It really doesn't matter, Dad. Sorry.

46:26.826 --> 46:27.826
Hell, sure, it matters.

46:27.910 --> 46:29.494
It does matter.
They took his coat.

46:29.579 --> 46:31.037
No. They... Look, I don't want the coat.

46:31.122 --> 46:32.414
They took the one
with the collar?

46:32.498 --> 46:34.124
I'm gonna go to your
school tomorrow and just...

46:34.208 --> 46:35.917
Yeah, you should. You'll only
make things worse if you go.

46:36.002 --> 46:37.085
Can't I do what
I think is right?

46:37.170 --> 46:38.795
Well, you know, what
do you think is right?

46:38.880 --> 46:40.672
A baseball bat across
the face would be nice.

46:40.756 --> 46:42.132
Paulie, what are
you telling this kid?

46:42.216 --> 46:43.341
Adrian, can I have
the plate?

46:43.426 --> 46:44.634
I'm sorry, yes, Rocky.

46:44.719 --> 46:46.970
You know, I had trouble one
time when I was in school.

46:47.054 --> 46:49.264
It seemed like every day
I got chased by this one kid,

46:49.348 --> 46:51.391
till one day my mother
said to me, she said,

46:51.476 --> 46:53.226
"Just pretend
the guy's like a balloon. "

46:53.311 --> 46:54.519
Balloon?

46:54.604 --> 46:57.481
She said if you pop him hard,
these guys just go away.

47:00.234 --> 47:02.652
Tommy, we're trying to raise our son

47:02.737 --> 47:05.197
so he can handle
his problems with his mind,

47:05.281 --> 47:06.573
not his muscles.

47:07.241 --> 47:08.241
Sorry.

47:08.326 --> 47:09.326
That's why I'm
gonna get mangled.

47:09.410 --> 47:11.328
No, you ain't gonna
get mangled.

47:11.412 --> 47:13.163
Dad, will you
teach me how to fight?

47:13.247 --> 47:14.915
A baseball bat
would be nice.

47:14.999 --> 47:17.918
Come on. Do you want to grow
up and just use your fists?

47:18.002 --> 47:20.378
You know, Adrian, I don't
think it would be so bad

47:20.463 --> 47:24.841
if I taught him how to throw
a few deadly punches, you know.

47:24.926 --> 47:26.843
Tommy, did your Dad
teach you how to fight?

47:27.220 --> 47:28.512
No. Not exactly.
I had to...

47:28.596 --> 47:29.638
What?

47:29.722 --> 47:30.805
Come on, sweetheart,
don't get personal.

47:30.890 --> 47:31.890
No, it's okay.

47:31.974 --> 47:35.143
See, my old man, he used
to drink a lot, seriously.

47:35.228 --> 47:37.521
He'd go out with his
friends and tie one on,

47:37.605 --> 47:39.189
then he'd come home
and look to punch on me.

47:39.273 --> 47:41.525
You know, he'd punch on my mother, too.

47:41.609 --> 47:43.276
He did that
a lot of times.

47:43.361 --> 47:45.695
You know, so, growing up, I never
really thought about fighting anybody

47:45.780 --> 47:46.988
but my father.

47:47.073 --> 47:50.116
You know, when I was 13,
I got in trouble at school.

47:50.201 --> 47:52.369
He tied me down
and he whipped me so bad

47:52.453 --> 47:53.745
I couldn't walk for a week.

47:53.829 --> 47:55.288
Just couldn't do anything.

47:56.499 --> 47:59.417
But, I tell you, the first guy
I ever knocked out was my father.

47:59.502 --> 48:03.046
And now when I get in the ring,
it's like all I see is him.

48:03.130 --> 48:05.257
That's kind of sick, huh?

48:06.092 --> 48:07.759
Hey, yo, Tommy.
At least you had

48:07.843 --> 48:09.636
an old man to
knock out, you know.

48:12.098 --> 48:13.265
Yeah.

48:14.600 --> 48:16.601
Some of us didn't even
have that, you know?

48:16.686 --> 48:18.436
Yeah, someday you could
punch out your pop.

48:18.521 --> 48:21.189
Hey, yo, Paulie, what are you
telling the kid things like this?

48:21.274 --> 48:23.149
Hey, it's fittest
of the survival.

48:24.569 --> 48:25.860
Hey, Tommy,

48:25.945 --> 48:27.696
where you staying tonight?
You got a place?

48:27.780 --> 48:30.323
I'll find someplace to stay.
I mean...

48:30.408 --> 48:32.701
No, I tell you, we got
room down in the basement.

48:32.785 --> 48:33.785
It's not...
It's nice, I don't know.

48:33.869 --> 48:34.869
What about me?

48:34.954 --> 48:37.163
Wait, now, sweetheart. Your
son is sleeping down there.

48:37.248 --> 48:39.958
No, well, he can stay
with his uncle, right?

48:40.042 --> 48:41.209
What the hell am I?
A pit stop?

48:41.335 --> 48:43.336
No... Hey, I don't want
to cause any problems.

48:43.421 --> 48:44.671
I mean, I can find someplace to stay.

48:44.755 --> 48:46.298
No, it's okay.
You know, it's just

48:46.382 --> 48:49.551
for a little while,
you know, right?

48:49.635 --> 48:51.261
No problem at all. You
know, it'll be all right.

48:51.345 --> 48:53.805
Hey, kid, I appreciate it. Is
that all right? It's cold outside.

48:53.889 --> 48:55.432
Hey, I'm not
changing no sheets.

48:55.516 --> 48:57.767
Hey, since when
have you ever?

48:58.769 --> 49:00.228
Hey, Tommy, why don't
you come on down

49:00.313 --> 49:02.731
and we'll show
you the whole place?

49:02.815 --> 49:04.024
Sweetheart, why don't you go downstairs,

49:04.108 --> 49:05.108
show your Father
what you did today?

49:05.192 --> 49:07.027
Come on. Come on.

49:11.657 --> 49:14.159
Hey, junior, your plumbing
don't leak, do it?

49:21.792 --> 49:22.834
You know this guy?

49:22.918 --> 49:24.502
Yeah. He hits hard.

49:27.381 --> 49:28.965
You know, Adrian, man,
she can really cook.

49:29.050 --> 49:30.133
Yeah,
she's okay.

49:30.217 --> 49:31.760
Listen, Tommy,
we ain't had a chance

49:31.844 --> 49:34.638
to get this place
too nice, so...

49:34.722 --> 49:37.098
I'll get it together in
a little while, you know.

49:38.142 --> 49:40.602
Wow, man! This is what it's all about!

49:40.686 --> 49:41.936
Holy mackerel...
Well, I...

49:42.021 --> 49:44.230
Why do you keep
this stuff down here?

49:44.315 --> 49:45.649
When did you get
a chance to do this?

49:45.733 --> 49:46.900
He took
everything out of a box

49:46.984 --> 49:48.485
and fixed this up like this.
It's beautiful!

49:48.569 --> 49:52.197
And you painted! When'd you
get a chance to do this, kid?

49:52.281 --> 49:54.157
After school.
It's no big deal.

49:54.241 --> 49:56.159
If you don't mind me asking,
where'd you get the glove?

49:56.243 --> 49:57.243
This?
Yeah.

49:57.328 --> 49:59.287
Thanks. This is one
of my favorite objects.

49:59.372 --> 50:02.207
You know, like, Mickey give
me this before he departed.

50:02.291 --> 50:04.793
It was Rocky Marciano's
cufflink that we had fixed.

50:04.877 --> 50:06.961
Really? The real Rocky Marciano? Yeah.

50:07.046 --> 50:08.797
Yeah. You know, you got me
thinking about Mick.

50:08.881 --> 50:10.382
I wanna show you something.
Come on.

50:10.466 --> 50:14.094
He told me a long time ago.
He says that,

50:15.221 --> 50:17.889
fightin' is like,
90% in the skull

50:17.973 --> 50:19.265
and 10% in the body.

50:19.350 --> 50:20.558
This is what
he says to me.

50:20.643 --> 50:23.561
Hey, Dad, I met this really
nice girl today. She's great.

50:23.646 --> 50:24.729
Yeah? Really?
That's wonderful.

50:24.814 --> 50:27.065
Yeah, she's a lot
better than Sarah.

50:27.149 --> 50:28.608
Hey,
don't change the station.

50:28.693 --> 50:30.068
I'll be right back with you.

50:30.152 --> 50:32.946
I just wanna tell Tommy
a few things, you know? Hey.

50:33.030 --> 50:35.949
Who was your best
friend back in Orlando?

50:36.033 --> 50:38.243
That's...
That's Oklahoma.

50:38.327 --> 50:40.286
Right, well, yeah.
Eric Elder.

50:40.371 --> 50:44.499
No, no, no. No, your best friend
is a guy named Frankie Fear.

50:44.583 --> 50:47.252
You see, fear is
a fighter's best friend.

50:47.336 --> 50:49.295
You know, but it ain't
nothing to be ashamed of.

50:49.380 --> 50:52.298
See, fear keeps you sharp,
it keeps you awake,

50:52.383 --> 50:54.426
you know, it makes you want to
survive. You know what I mean?

50:54.510 --> 50:57.887
But the thing is, you gotta learn
how to control it. All right?

50:57.972 --> 50:59.889
'Cause fear is like
this fire, all right?

50:59.974 --> 51:01.766
And it's burning deep inside.

51:01.851 --> 51:05.186
Now, if you control it,
Tommy, it's gonna make you hot.

51:05.271 --> 51:07.772
But, you see, if this
thing here, it controls you,

51:07.857 --> 51:10.734
it's gonna burn you and
everything else around you up.

51:10.818 --> 51:12.110
That's right, you know?

51:12.194 --> 51:15.697
Anyway, these are the
things that was taught to me,

51:15.781 --> 51:18.658
and if you want,
I'd like to teach to you.

51:19.201 --> 51:21.953
So, this... This mean
you're gonna manage me?

51:22.037 --> 51:24.038
Absolutely.
Hey, home team! Okay!

51:24.123 --> 51:25.373
All right! Yeah!

51:25.458 --> 51:26.750
Let's go for it.
Hey, Rock,

51:26.834 --> 51:28.918
as long as we're down here, do
you mind showing me a few things?

51:29.003 --> 51:31.337
Sure, Tommy. I'm gonna
show you a lot of things.

51:36.594 --> 51:39.637
Hey, rich boy, how much you
got in your pocket today?

51:39.722 --> 51:41.473
Nothing.
Come on, let's have it.

51:41.557 --> 51:42.932
Nothing. I got nothing.

51:43.017 --> 51:44.476
Come on. Give me the money.

51:44.560 --> 51:45.894
Come on!

51:45.978 --> 51:47.228
Hey, I gotta eat.

51:47.313 --> 51:50.440
He's hungry. He's gotta
eat. Well, eat this!

51:53.360 --> 51:54.736
I got it. I got it. Go.

51:55.696 --> 51:58.698
Father Carmine! Yo!

51:59.200 --> 52:01.034
Father Carmine!

52:01.118 --> 52:02.118
You know,
maybe he's not home.

52:02.203 --> 52:03.787
No, priests is always home.

52:03.871 --> 52:05.246
Rocky!

52:05.331 --> 52:06.456
Yo!

52:08.667 --> 52:11.461
Well, I didn't want to
disturb you that much, Father.

52:14.048 --> 52:15.089
Excellent.

52:15.174 --> 52:17.091
Everything is perfect.
You know...

52:17.176 --> 52:19.469
Father, this is my
new friend, Tommy Gunn.

52:24.475 --> 52:26.851
Well, I was wondering... You
know, Tommy here is a fighter,

52:26.936 --> 52:28.686
and I'm supposed to be
his manager, you know?

52:28.771 --> 52:30.522
So I was wondering if
you could do me a favor,

52:30.606 --> 52:31.815
you know,
if you ain't that busy.

52:31.899 --> 52:34.234
If you could throw us down
a couple blessings, you know?

52:34.318 --> 52:36.861
One, that I don't
mess up being a manager,

52:36.946 --> 52:39.656
and B, that Tommy does as
good as I think he can do.

52:39.740 --> 52:42.992
You know, great, and don't get
hurt none. Could you do that?

52:51.252 --> 52:52.418
I love when he does that.

52:52.503 --> 52:55.004
Hey, thanks, Father.
I really appreciate this.

52:56.215 --> 52:57.215
Anytime.

52:57.299 --> 52:59.092
Okay. Hey, I'll see you
in church!

53:01.679 --> 53:02.679
Okay.

53:02.763 --> 53:03.930
Hey, man, what'd you do this for?

53:04.014 --> 53:06.474
Hey, it don't hurt having an
angel in your corner, you know?

53:06.642 --> 53:07.684
Come on!

53:11.814 --> 53:13.523
Hey, Rock,
how's it going?

53:13.607 --> 53:14.732
Doing great, guys!

53:14.817 --> 53:16.609
Better slow down, we're
gonna give you a ticket.

53:16.694 --> 53:18.528
This is Tommy Gunn.
He's gonna be champ, guys.

53:18.612 --> 53:19.779
How you doing, Tom?

53:30.291 --> 53:33.084
Break it up. Break! Break! Break it!

53:45.431 --> 53:46.598
Get off the ropes.

53:54.607 --> 53:55.648
Just go easy, all right?

53:55.733 --> 53:56.733
Man, I need more work.

53:56.817 --> 53:58.401
No, no, no, you're ready.
No, I need more work.

53:58.485 --> 53:59.611
This guy's killing me.

53:59.653 --> 54:01.362
Now, listen to me. You're
ready now. He's killing me.

54:01.447 --> 54:02.947
No, you're perfect,
you understanding me?

54:02.990 --> 54:04.741
Man, I feel weak. I feel
weak. No, no, no. Listen to me.

54:04.825 --> 54:05.867
Shut up! Listen to me.

54:05.951 --> 54:07.785
Mick used to say
the only difference

54:07.870 --> 54:10.914
between a hero and a coward is
the hero's willing to go for it.

54:10.998 --> 54:12.582
All right? He's willing
to take the shot, okay?

54:12.666 --> 54:14.042
Now, this guy over
here is scared, too.

54:14.126 --> 54:15.835
You're scared. He's
scared. You're both scared.

54:15.920 --> 54:18.087
Remember, in the basement,
when we was talking about fear

54:18.172 --> 54:19.797
and how it's
like this fire, huh?

54:19.882 --> 54:22.383
And you gotta control it 'cause
it's like, it'll, like, burn you up

54:22.468 --> 54:23.760
or it's gonna burn him up.
All right?

54:23.844 --> 54:25.845
Now, you gotta make it
work for you, Tommy, okay?

54:25.930 --> 54:27.722
I would never do nothing
that would hurt you.

54:27.806 --> 54:29.015
You gotta understand
what I'm saying.

54:29.099 --> 54:30.558
Now, fear is like
this fire, okay?

54:30.643 --> 54:33.686
Now, let it burn and burn until
it becomes like this volcano,

54:33.771 --> 54:35.772
and when the time is right,
and you see the opening,

54:35.856 --> 54:37.440
explode all over
this guy, okay?

54:37.524 --> 54:38.858
Now, you can take him, okay?

54:38.901 --> 54:40.360
It's all heart, you
understand? Okay. Got it.

54:40.444 --> 54:42.612
It ain't all muscle, it's
all heart. Heart and fire.

54:42.696 --> 54:43.947
Heart and fire! Okay.

54:44.031 --> 54:44.989
Now you do it.

54:47.701 --> 54:50.370
Remember, I'm like this angel
sitting on your shoulder, okay?

54:50.454 --> 54:52.205
I ain't gonna let nothing
happen to you, okay?

54:52.289 --> 54:53.289
Go!
Got it.

54:54.625 --> 54:55.917
Go for it

54:57.836 --> 54:59.545
Come on, Tommy, jab!

55:03.300 --> 55:05.802
Explode! Left, right!

55:08.472 --> 55:09.597
The body! The body!

55:10.724 --> 55:11.766
Hook!

55:13.394 --> 55:14.352
All right!

55:14.436 --> 55:16.354
Are you gonna stop
or keep on rushin'

55:16.438 --> 55:18.648
Farther, faster,
quicker than the next man

55:18.732 --> 55:20.608
To be the best
is the master plan

55:20.693 --> 55:22.902
Go on with all you got
Give it your best shot

55:22.987 --> 55:24.737
Don't ever think
about trying to stop

55:24.822 --> 55:27.323
Keep reaching, pushing
hoping for perfection

55:27.408 --> 55:29.033
Make up the direction

55:29.118 --> 55:31.035
Don't ever stop for a moment

55:31.120 --> 55:32.662
If you got it, flaunt it

55:32.746 --> 55:33.830
And get up on it

55:33.914 --> 55:36.249
Go for yours not for a
minute but all the time

55:36.333 --> 55:38.084
You better do it
'cause I'm going for mine

55:40.254 --> 55:41.337
Yeah!

55:41.422 --> 55:42.588
Go for it

55:42.673 --> 55:44.549
Go, go, go

55:44.633 --> 55:47.093
I see it in your eyes

55:47.177 --> 55:48.553
Time!

55:52.725 --> 55:55.518
You've got to go
for the feelin'

55:55.602 --> 55:57.687
It's time for the rhyme
of the bold and the gifted

55:57.771 --> 56:00.023
Listen closely
and you'll get lifted

56:00.107 --> 56:01.858
Like you've never
been before

56:01.942 --> 56:04.318
Get more than
you bargained for, for sure

56:04.403 --> 56:06.487
Life can be a trip
full of trouble

56:06.572 --> 56:08.698
But you gotta stand up
and fight back double

56:08.782 --> 56:10.825
Don't let nothin'
hold you back, yo

56:10.909 --> 56:13.661
When life says stop
you say go, go

56:13.746 --> 56:15.788
Go to the body, Tommy.
Come on.

56:15.873 --> 56:17.457
That's it,
that's it!

56:18.542 --> 56:21.127
Sam, you okay?
Hey, Tommy Gunn.

56:21.253 --> 56:23.796
You got some guns,
don't you? Paulie!

56:23.881 --> 56:25.631
'Cause I know
you got the knack

56:25.716 --> 56:27.550
To go farther than
you've ever been before

56:27.634 --> 56:28.885
Rocky!

56:31.388 --> 56:32.472
It's over.

56:34.308 --> 56:36.309
18, 19.

56:36.769 --> 56:39.395
I see it in your eyes

56:40.022 --> 56:43.274
Drive through it.
85. Go on, now.

56:45.027 --> 56:47.945
You got to go
for the feeling

56:52.076 --> 56:54.577
And 10. Come on,
you can do it. That's it.

56:56.914 --> 56:58.247
You got it.
Come on, bring it up.

56:58.332 --> 56:59.624
Yeah!

56:59.708 --> 57:01.751
I got you.
I got you this time.

57:08.425 --> 57:09.425
Damn!

57:12.930 --> 57:14.138
Yeah.

57:14.223 --> 57:17.350
Tommy, you know, these trunks, is,
like, very special to me, you know?

57:19.895 --> 57:20.937
Dig, dig, dig!

57:24.733 --> 57:25.733
Hook!

57:26.735 --> 57:27.819
Yeah!

57:29.530 --> 57:31.989
Way to go, kid! That was
great! That was great!

57:32.324 --> 57:34.659
Tommy, Tommy!

57:34.743 --> 57:36.119
Go for it, yeah

57:36.203 --> 57:37.870
Go, go, go

57:37.955 --> 57:40.456
I see it in your eyes

57:40.541 --> 57:41.707
Go for it

57:44.044 --> 57:45.044
All right, kid.

57:46.213 --> 57:49.632
You got to go
for the feeling

57:52.594 --> 57:54.595
Yeah! Whoo!

57:55.639 --> 57:57.598
I beat the man!
I don't believe it!

57:57.683 --> 57:59.183
You sure did.

57:59.268 --> 58:01.018
You're very swift,
Tommy Gunn.

58:01.103 --> 58:03.396
To be or not to be dope
That's the question

58:03.480 --> 58:05.565
Are you gonna stop
or keep on rushin'

58:05.649 --> 58:07.900
Farther, faster
Quicker than the next man

58:07.985 --> 58:09.944
To be the best
is the master plan

58:10.737 --> 58:13.406
Yeah, Merlin, listen.
Got an idea.

58:14.700 --> 58:16.576
I think we can
finally nail Balboa.

58:17.161 --> 58:18.244
Go for it

58:20.789 --> 58:22.415
They're waiting again.
Yeah.

58:22.499 --> 58:24.625
If you don't got enough
money, I got almost a dollar.

58:24.710 --> 58:26.669
Save it.
Slumming again, bimbo?

58:26.753 --> 58:28.337
Hey, barefoot,
what you got in the bag?

58:28.422 --> 58:29.380
Shut up.

58:29.464 --> 58:31.007
Hey, squaw, what?
You're not talking to me?

58:31.091 --> 58:33.092
Take two more steps and I'm
gonna pound your teeth out.

58:33.594 --> 58:35.011
Go for it!

58:35.095 --> 58:36.304
What'd he say?

58:36.388 --> 58:38.806
The punk's losing his mind.
What'd you say?

58:38.891 --> 58:40.474
Go for it!
Do it!

58:45.939 --> 58:47.315
Kill him!

58:57.868 --> 59:00.369
Come on! Put up your hands! Come on!

59:00.454 --> 59:02.872
No way!
I didn't like him anyway!

59:06.376 --> 59:08.211
I think that belongs to me.

59:08.295 --> 59:12.590
Robert! Robert! Robert!

59:12.674 --> 59:14.634
If you wanna end this,
let's end it now.

59:15.594 --> 59:17.762
Yeah, I got no problems with that.

59:17.846 --> 59:19.430
See you later.
All right.

59:20.849 --> 59:21.891
I can't believe it.

59:21.975 --> 59:23.476
Well, are you gonna tell your dad?

59:23.560 --> 59:24.936
Yeah.
Come on, let's go.

59:27.022 --> 59:28.981
Good, that's it.
One more time.

59:29.983 --> 59:31.651
Yeah, yeah, look...
Hey, Tommy, Tommy,

59:31.735 --> 59:33.402
you're doing
great combinations,

59:33.487 --> 59:37.240
but you gotta learn to move side
to side, like a windshield wiper,

59:37.324 --> 59:39.242
so you ain't getting kicked
in the face with his jabs.

59:39.326 --> 59:40.618
Dad!
Back and forth, you know...

59:40.702 --> 59:43.788
I got my coat back!
Look, I got my coat!

59:43.872 --> 59:46.499
That's great, kid.
That's beautiful.

59:46.583 --> 59:50.503
I trashed this guy. Everybody in
the school went crazy. Everybody!

59:50.587 --> 59:52.046
Hey, Rock, man, I'm
cooling down over here.

59:52.130 --> 59:53.798
Hey, listen,
I gotta get back with Tommy

59:53.882 --> 59:55.967
'cause we gotta work out. He's
cooling down and everything, but...

59:56.051 --> 59:58.219
Listen, go tell your mom. She'd
like to hear things like that.

59:58.303 --> 59:59.929
That's beautiful, you know.

01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:01.847
Okay, let's go, Tommy.

01:00:02.849 --> 01:00:05.476
Looking good!
Come on, lay it on me.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:09.188
Look at Tommy go!
Look at Tommy go!

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:19.323
Union Cane, the new heavyweight
champion of the world...

01:00:19.408 --> 01:00:20.658
You think I have
a chance at that?

01:00:20.742 --> 01:00:21.867
Absolutely. You kidding?

01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:26.330
Hey, Tommy, anybody's got two
fists, right, and a good heartbeat,

01:00:26.415 --> 01:00:27.790
they got a chance, right?

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.459
Like a monsoon, typhoon,
stormin' in the worst way

01:00:30.544 --> 01:00:32.628
Here to stay, no play
hear what I say

01:00:32.713 --> 01:00:35.631
Not goin' out 'cause I
got it goin' on intense

01:00:35.716 --> 01:00:36.757
You're out!

01:00:37.301 --> 01:00:38.926
Strong renegade
cannot be slayed

01:00:39.011 --> 01:00:40.803
You wanna rate me
A is my grade

01:00:40.887 --> 01:00:42.888
Move and groove till
you're lookin' like a pro, yo

01:00:42.973 --> 01:00:45.558
Takin' 'em out
with a rock-hard body blow

01:00:46.768 --> 01:00:47.852
Go!

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:52.106
Come on, kid, 49.
Heads up!

01:00:56.361 --> 01:00:57.778
Yeah!

01:01:01.616 --> 01:01:03.868
Quick on the draw
Shoot for the jaw

01:01:03.952 --> 01:01:04.994
Stone to the bone

01:01:05.078 --> 01:01:07.621
Rebels stand tall
Ask for nothing

01:01:07.706 --> 01:01:08.789
Boy, you got hands of gold.

01:01:08.874 --> 01:01:10.458
I want to introduce
you to somebody.

01:01:10.542 --> 01:01:12.168
Ring the bell
Feel the vibration

01:01:12.252 --> 01:01:14.462
Straight to the kill
For best stimulation

01:01:14.546 --> 01:01:17.256
Calculation for
the situation at the end

01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:18.841
It's total ovation

01:01:18.925 --> 01:01:20.134
Keep it up

01:01:22.888 --> 01:01:24.055
Keep it up

01:01:24.139 --> 01:01:25.264
Go, Tommy!

01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:28.768
Don't you stop now
Keep it up

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:32.104
Yeah!

01:01:33.273 --> 01:01:35.358
Don't you stop now

01:01:35.442 --> 01:01:39.236
Keep it up, keep it up

01:01:39.613 --> 01:01:41.614
Keep it up, yeah

01:01:43.784 --> 01:01:47.078
Keep it up, keep it up

01:01:47.954 --> 01:01:51.040
Keep it up, ooh

01:01:52.209 --> 01:01:54.293
Make 'em sweat
wet like a hot dog

01:01:54.378 --> 01:01:56.337
Turns on your mind
like you were an android

01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:00.591
I'm on, I said it
You know it, I meant it

01:02:00.675 --> 01:02:02.468
I control your souls
hold the contract

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:05.012
Adrenaline feels good
like a climax

01:02:08.809 --> 01:02:10.476
Yeah!
That's it. It's over!

01:02:17.651 --> 01:02:19.110
Tommy, back him up!

01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:27.076
That's it!
Yeah!

01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.411
There's your boat, Rock.

01:02:28.495 --> 01:02:30.413
What boat?
The one that's sinking.

01:02:46.430 --> 01:02:48.305
Tommy Gunn at the top.

01:02:49.891 --> 01:02:51.392
You come with the Duke,

01:02:52.310 --> 01:02:53.978
you can get
the kind of payday fights

01:02:54.062 --> 01:02:55.688
Balboa could
only dream about.

01:02:57.107 --> 01:02:59.525
To the victor
goes the spoils.

01:03:08.827 --> 01:03:10.161
Slip the jab, Tommy!

01:03:16.001 --> 01:03:17.126
Yes!

01:03:18.044 --> 01:03:19.086
You're out!

01:03:22.215 --> 01:03:23.299
Yeah!
Great, kid.

01:03:23.383 --> 01:03:24.508
You did it, man!
You did it! You did it!

01:03:24.593 --> 01:03:26.343
Hey, man, now am I gonna
get a shot at the title?

01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:28.471
Yeah, you're gonna get one
real soon. Tommy, over here!

01:03:28.597 --> 01:03:30.431
Hey, baby,
how are you?

01:03:30.765 --> 01:03:33.350
The winner, at two
minutes and 10 seconds...

01:03:33.435 --> 01:03:35.811
So, Rocky, when's Tommy
going up against Union Cane?

01:03:35.896 --> 01:03:37.354
We gotta talk about that.

01:03:37.397 --> 01:03:39.148
How does it feel to be a
manager? Get lost, will you?

01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:41.108
Rocko, he ain't
worth it, buddy.

01:03:41.193 --> 01:03:43.194
He fought a great fight,
you know, Paulie?

01:03:43.278 --> 01:03:46.405
Your ship is sunk, Rocko.
It sunk, huh?

01:04:02.714 --> 01:04:04.465
He probably got hung
up in traffic, Adrian.

01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:05.674
He should have
been here by now.

01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:07.801
Why? Why? It's Christmas time.

01:04:07.886 --> 01:04:09.345
He should be here
with his family.

01:04:09.429 --> 01:04:11.597
Well, maybe he doesn't
think this is his family.

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:12.681
Sure it is.

01:04:12.766 --> 01:04:13.766
Yo, Adrian, look.
Look at this.

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:15.309
What?

01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:18.938
I wanna give
this to him.

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:20.105
What do you think?

01:04:21.107 --> 01:04:22.608
I think you've given enough.

01:04:23.193 --> 01:04:24.610
Hey, come on, Adrian.

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:26.695
He's given us some
things too, you know?

01:04:26.780 --> 01:04:28.864
He's given us, like,
a second shot, right?

01:04:28.949 --> 01:04:30.157
Come on, it's Christmas.

01:04:33.161 --> 01:04:35.287
That's right.
Only in America.

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:37.623
Having the best,
wearing the best.

01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:39.667
But to keep it up,
you gotta stay on top.

01:04:39.751 --> 01:04:41.210
Nobody remembers
number two, kiddo.

01:04:41.294 --> 01:04:42.378
I sure don't.

01:04:42.462 --> 01:04:45.339
Now, Tommy, I've checked
with the boxing commission.

01:04:45.423 --> 01:04:48.676
It seems there's no formal
contract between you and Balboa.

01:04:49.844 --> 01:04:51.929
No, nothing. Just a... Just a handshake.

01:04:52.013 --> 01:04:55.724
Tommy, this is a complex business
and you got to stay sharp.

01:04:55.809 --> 01:04:57.560
But I don't have to
tell you that, do I?

01:04:57.644 --> 01:05:00.312
'Cause it gotta be damn difficult,
you living in Rocky's shadow,

01:05:00.397 --> 01:05:01.689
people calling
you his puppet.

01:05:01.773 --> 01:05:03.774
I don't know anybody who could
have done it as long as you have.

01:05:03.858 --> 01:05:05.484
Tommy, I'm afraid.

01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:08.237
I'm afraid that if you keep
going the way you're going,

01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:10.489
you're gonna be watching
the parade go by.

01:05:11.366 --> 01:05:12.366
Exactly.

01:05:13.118 --> 01:05:15.244
Tommy, you haven't had
the big payday yet,

01:05:15.328 --> 01:05:17.746
and you won't until you
fight those top contenders.

01:05:17.831 --> 01:05:21.083
And those top contenders,
Tommy boy, I do surely own.

01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:23.586
I got the contracts.

01:05:23.670 --> 01:05:25.129
It's a complex business.

01:05:26.047 --> 01:05:28.882
But if you want the best,
then go with the best.

01:05:28.967 --> 01:05:30.551
Man, what about Rocky?
I mean...

01:05:30.635 --> 01:05:31.760
Rocky can still train you.

01:05:31.845 --> 01:05:33.721
My God,
he's done a wonderful job.

01:05:33.805 --> 01:05:36.599
Now look here,
here's $20,000.

01:05:36.683 --> 01:05:37.975
Take it as an advance.

01:05:40.186 --> 01:05:42.354
Time to put some hustle
behind this muscle.

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:43.647
Merry Christmas.

01:05:44.858 --> 01:05:46.442
Merry Christmas.

01:05:47.902 --> 01:05:49.445
Whoa,
stop the presses!

01:05:49.529 --> 01:05:52.114
Yo, Adrian, I can't believe
who just come up on the roof.

01:05:52.198 --> 01:05:55.242
You know, hey, you know, he
just landed there and crashed.

01:05:55.327 --> 01:05:56.452
And who do you
think it is?

01:05:56.536 --> 01:05:58.495
Do I hear
reindeer on my roof?

01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:01.123
You know...

01:06:01.207 --> 01:06:02.207
Rantlers.

01:06:02.292 --> 01:06:04.710
Unbelievable.
It's like a billion...

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:06.295
Whoa! Come on.

01:06:06.379 --> 01:06:08.464
Look who's here!
You know this guy.

01:06:08.548 --> 01:06:10.132
You got a weird family.

01:06:10.216 --> 01:06:11.258
Don't I know.

01:06:11.343 --> 01:06:13.302
It's gonna be next Christmas
before he gets down.

01:06:13.386 --> 01:06:16.680
Hey, let's put it
together for Santa! Hey!

01:06:16.765 --> 01:06:18.432
Merry X-mas. Yo, yo, yo.

01:06:18.516 --> 01:06:20.601
Hey, I don't think
you got it right, Santa.

01:06:20.685 --> 01:06:23.729
No, no, no.
It's, "Ho, ho, ho. "

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:24.855
What's
the freaking difference?

01:06:24.939 --> 01:06:26.690
Where I come from,
it's, "Yo, yo, yo. "

01:06:26.775 --> 01:06:29.151
Looks like we got
a 90-proof Santa.

01:06:29.235 --> 01:06:31.028
Hey, Santa,

01:06:31.112 --> 01:06:33.822
tell all the kids what
you got in the bag for them

01:06:33.907 --> 01:06:35.324
that you brought
from the North.

01:06:35.408 --> 01:06:37.159
Yeah, I got my laundry.

01:06:37.243 --> 01:06:38.827
No, you got the wrong bag.

01:06:38.912 --> 01:06:40.913
Come on, chubby, get out
of the way. Yo, watch it.

01:06:40.997 --> 01:06:42.164
Let Santa take a seat.

01:06:42.582 --> 01:06:44.041
Come here, little boy.
You been nice?

01:06:44.167 --> 01:06:46.168
Uncle Paulie! Come over
here. Sit down here.

01:06:46.252 --> 01:06:48.754
Hey, kid, why don't you tell
Santa what you need? What you...

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:50.172
He's stretching
the clothes, man.

01:06:50.256 --> 01:06:51.507
I don't need nothing.

01:06:51.591 --> 01:06:54.468
Hey, kid, tell Santa what
you really want. Come on.

01:06:54.552 --> 01:06:57.846
That ain't Santa. It's
Uncle Paulie. Let's get real.

01:06:57.931 --> 01:06:59.014
What do you mean,
"Get real"?

01:06:59.099 --> 01:07:00.724
You know,
why you talking like that?

01:07:00.809 --> 01:07:02.726
We're just trying
to have a good time,

01:07:02.811 --> 01:07:05.062
and Santa's here
and everything and...

01:07:05.146 --> 01:07:06.397
It's stupid!

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:09.983
Yo, you know, come on. It ain't stupid.

01:07:10.068 --> 01:07:11.985
We're just trying
to pretend here.

01:07:12.070 --> 01:07:14.446
But you see, you're
supposed to be pretending.

01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:16.990
It's like this game,
right? You know?

01:07:17.075 --> 01:07:19.576
I don't like pretending. Why
don't you guys talk to Santa?

01:07:19.661 --> 01:07:21.954
Hey, yo, kid, you know,
I ain't talking to them.

01:07:22.038 --> 01:07:23.872
I'm talking with you,
here, you know.

01:07:23.957 --> 01:07:27.376
See, it's very important that
you spend time with the family,

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.044
you know,
and have a good time and

01:07:29.129 --> 01:07:31.130
just getting the spirit
going, you know...

01:07:31.214 --> 01:07:32.214
It's good, right?

01:07:32.298 --> 01:07:33.966
Good for what?
Come on, let's go.

01:07:35.802 --> 01:07:38.554
Look, his friends are here.
Maybe he doesn't want to.

01:07:38.638 --> 01:07:40.889
Adrian, I know
what he wants.

01:07:40.974 --> 01:07:42.558
How do you know
what I want?

01:07:42.642 --> 01:07:43.726
'Cause I know you.

01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:46.603
You know me?
He thinks he knows me.

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:50.524
Look, I ain't
celebrating nothing, okay?

01:07:50.608 --> 01:07:51.942
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey, yo, come here.

01:07:52.026 --> 01:07:53.318
What's the matter
with you?

01:07:53.403 --> 01:07:54.945
You know? We always done this before.

01:07:55.029 --> 01:07:56.947
We always had a good time,
Adrian, you know?

01:07:57.031 --> 01:07:58.490
We don't have to
change nothing, never.

01:07:58.575 --> 01:08:00.576
I mean, do you
remember last year

01:08:00.660 --> 01:08:03.162
when we had fun,
when we had a good time?

01:08:03.830 --> 01:08:06.749
It ain't last year, and
you ain't the same either.

01:08:08.835 --> 01:08:09.877
What?

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:15.841
Adrian, what...
What did I do?

01:08:16.551 --> 01:08:17.676
Go talk to him.

01:08:21.514 --> 01:08:23.932
Even I could've saw
this thing happening.

01:08:24.017 --> 01:08:26.100
I should have went to Miami
when I had the chance.

01:08:28.062 --> 01:08:30.522
You wanna talk,
let's talk.

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:35.402
You know, I thought we was
supposed to be, like, like,

01:08:35.819 --> 01:08:37.571
you know, be very close.

01:08:37.654 --> 01:08:38.947
Hey, come on, kid.
I love you.

01:08:39.032 --> 01:08:40.282
No, you don't.

01:08:41.033 --> 01:08:43.702
Sure I do, you know? Do you
remember what the deal was?

01:08:43.787 --> 01:08:47.706
We were supposed to be, like,
tight, like crossed fingers.

01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:50.584
No, no, what you want is
you and Tommy to be tight.

01:08:50.667 --> 01:08:51.710
That's who you're
really talking about.

01:08:51.795 --> 01:08:52.795
Don't say that.

01:08:52.879 --> 01:08:54.129
Why can't I say it?

01:08:54.214 --> 01:08:56.631
Since he's been here, it's
been "Tommy this, Tommy that. "

01:08:56.716 --> 01:08:59.551
You don't have no time for
nobody, so I got no time for you.

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:00.969
Hey, what are you
saying to me, kid?

01:09:01.054 --> 01:09:02.345
You're like another person.

01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:04.305
You're the other person!

01:09:04.390 --> 01:09:05.890
You said I would be
number one to you!

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:07.142
You said that and you lied!

01:09:07.227 --> 01:09:09.645
You lied to me
and you lied to Mom!

01:09:09.729 --> 01:09:11.772
I never lied to you.

01:09:11.856 --> 01:09:13.398
Tommy needed my help.

01:09:13.483 --> 01:09:14.774
So did I.

01:09:15.527 --> 01:09:18.737
And remember when you said to
watch out for scams and deceptions?

01:09:19.404 --> 01:09:20.488
Yeah?

01:09:21.032 --> 01:09:23.908
You're the one that
should have watched out.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:32.667
Where you going?
Out.

01:09:32.752 --> 01:09:34.545
When are you coming back?
Later.

01:09:34.629 --> 01:09:36.129
Later? When?

01:09:36.214 --> 01:09:37.339
Later.

01:09:41.511 --> 01:09:43.804
Season's greetings,
Mrs. Balboa.

01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:46.849
You take care
of these people.

01:09:48.935 --> 01:09:51.854
Behold,
a Santa for all seasons!

01:09:53.606 --> 01:09:54.982
What, are you guys lost?

01:09:55.733 --> 01:09:57.192
Au contraire,
mon ami.

01:09:57.277 --> 01:09:59.111
I know exactly where I am.

01:10:00.738 --> 01:10:02.281
Yo, Rocko!

01:10:02.365 --> 01:10:04.032
Guess what's
coming to dinner?

01:10:04.117 --> 01:10:06.034
Tommy Gunn's
got new friends.

01:10:06.119 --> 01:10:08.161
New friends
for a new year.

01:10:08.538 --> 01:10:12.457
Please. Paulie.

01:10:12.917 --> 01:10:15.085
Nice tree. Charming.

01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:17.921
Hey, Tommy, how you doing?

01:10:18.006 --> 01:10:20.716
Merry Christmas, my lord.
Greetings!

01:10:20.967 --> 01:10:21.925
Yeah, how you doing?

01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:24.428
Listen, I don't wanna
take up too much time.

01:10:24.512 --> 01:10:26.513
I just wanted to come by and
give a little season's greetings.

01:10:26.598 --> 01:10:27.556
I don't need no presents.

01:10:27.640 --> 01:10:28.891
Give them to the neighbors.

01:10:28.975 --> 01:10:31.810
Look, you've done a hell of a
job with the man. Facts are facts.

01:10:31.895 --> 01:10:35.230
I'd have to be blind if I didn't
say a title shot isn't in the cards.

01:10:35.315 --> 01:10:36.398
Title shot?

01:10:36.482 --> 01:10:38.984
That's right, title shot. Now, we're
gonna work beautifully together.

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:40.319
No problems.

01:10:40.987 --> 01:10:42.195
No friction.

01:10:42.864 --> 01:10:44.865
Only harmony, huh?

01:10:44.949 --> 01:10:47.242
It's time to put some
hustle behind this muscle.

01:10:47.327 --> 01:10:49.578
Why, our Tommy boy here's got
a little something personal

01:10:49.662 --> 01:10:51.038
to discuss with you.

01:10:51.122 --> 01:10:53.123
So I'm gonna be
saying good night.

01:10:53.207 --> 01:10:54.249
Merry Christmas.

01:10:54.334 --> 01:10:55.459
Merry Christmas to you.

01:10:56.127 --> 01:10:57.836
See you soon, huh?
Bye.

01:10:58.963 --> 01:11:00.714
Sorry I'm late.
I ended up having dinner.

01:11:00.798 --> 01:11:01.965
Let's go.

01:11:02.050 --> 01:11:03.842
Hey, that's okay,
Tommy, you know,

01:11:03.927 --> 01:11:06.803
Adrian cooked something, but
it's probably all cold now.

01:11:06.888 --> 01:11:09.389
What we can do is make
sandwiches. It's no big...

01:11:09.474 --> 01:11:10.974
Rocky, I don't
wanna make sandwiches.

01:11:11.059 --> 01:11:14.311
I don't wanna make... No. Tommy,
why did you bring him here?

01:11:14.395 --> 01:11:15.854
He just wanted to come by.

01:11:15.939 --> 01:11:17.731
Tommy... Rocky, do you mind
if I talk to you outside

01:11:17.815 --> 01:11:19.232
about a few things?

01:11:19.317 --> 01:11:20.859
Yeah, sure.

01:11:21.361 --> 01:11:22.527
It's getting late.

01:11:22.612 --> 01:11:23.779
We have to be
there by 10:00.

01:11:23.863 --> 01:11:24.863
Rocky.

01:11:24.948 --> 01:11:26.281
No, it's okay.

01:11:29.953 --> 01:11:32.371
Hey, Tommy, what did you
wanna talk to me about?

01:11:32.455 --> 01:11:33.455
Isn’t it a long drive?

01:11:33.539 --> 01:11:34.623
Yeah.

01:11:34.707 --> 01:11:36.083
So, what do
you think?

01:11:37.377 --> 01:11:38.627
Well, where'd you
get this from?

01:11:38.711 --> 01:11:39.962
Duke gave it
to me.

01:11:40.046 --> 01:11:41.213
Tommy!

01:11:41.756 --> 01:11:42.839
Hey, you know,
maybe you ought to

01:11:42.924 --> 01:11:44.424
give this thing back,
you know, Tom.

01:11:44.509 --> 01:11:46.802
And I knew it. I knew
you were gonna say that.

01:11:46.886 --> 01:11:48.136
Give it back? Why?

01:11:48.221 --> 01:11:50.013
I mean, the guy
likes the way I fight.

01:11:50.098 --> 01:11:51.807
It's almost 10:00.
All right. We'll make it.

01:11:51.891 --> 01:11:55.268
I know, but, you know, you see
what he's doing here, Tommy?

01:11:55.353 --> 01:11:57.604
Hey, don't let him put
nothing between us, okay?

01:11:57.689 --> 01:11:58.730
We got something
good going here.

01:11:58.815 --> 01:11:59.815
Put? Like what?

01:11:59.899 --> 01:12:02.067
I mean, the guy was just
talking about getting a shot...

01:12:02.151 --> 01:12:04.319
But we don't need him,
you know what I mean?

01:12:04.404 --> 01:12:05.862
I mean,
you're gonna get a shot.

01:12:05.947 --> 01:12:08.240
You're gonna be able to buy
10 of these things here.

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:09.992
Rock, when you
gonna wake up, man?

01:12:10.076 --> 01:12:11.493
We're watching
the parade go by.

01:12:11.577 --> 01:12:13.996
What parade?
What are you talking about?

01:12:14.080 --> 01:12:15.122
What parade?
The big time.

01:12:15.206 --> 01:12:16.331
Man, the way I'm going,
I'm not gonna get

01:12:16.416 --> 01:12:17.958
a shot at the title
for a long time.

01:12:18.042 --> 01:12:19.751
Now, listen, Tommy... And
I've got a perfect record.

01:12:19.836 --> 01:12:22.504
I'm 22 and 0.
Where's the money? Where?

01:12:22.588 --> 01:12:24.548
Man, we haven't made
any serious money yet.

01:12:24.632 --> 01:12:25.716
And we won't
without the man.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.175
I ain't talking
about the money.

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:28.635
Look, the money is
gonna be there, but...

01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:30.387
I'm talking about
your rep, Tommy.

01:12:30.471 --> 01:12:32.973
Look, don't sell out. Don't.
We don't need this guy.

01:12:33.057 --> 01:12:36.018
Listen, Duke is a wonderful
man. Put the top up.

01:12:36.102 --> 01:12:37.686
Hey, forget about
the top, would you?

01:12:37.770 --> 01:12:39.396
I'm signing papers
with the man tomorrow.

01:12:39.480 --> 01:12:41.106
No, listen to me, Tommy,
you sign them papers,

01:12:41.190 --> 01:12:42.232
you're like his property.

01:12:42.316 --> 01:12:45.152
You see, you got no control. You
know, this is a dirty business.

01:12:45.236 --> 01:12:47.654
It's full of these thieves
and gangsters, you know,

01:12:47.739 --> 01:12:51.366
and they promise every good
young fighter who comes along...

01:12:51.451 --> 01:12:55.370
They promise them the world,
and then they suck them dry.

01:12:55.455 --> 01:12:56.955
And they leave them when
they ain't worth nothing.

01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:58.707
They leave them in the
gutter, broke, Tommy!

01:12:58.791 --> 01:13:00.375
That's the way
this business is run.

01:13:00.460 --> 01:13:02.878
Look, guys like Duke,
you know what he is?

01:13:02.962 --> 01:13:04.838
He's a vampire.

01:13:04.922 --> 01:13:06.715
He's living off
your blood, Tommy.

01:13:06.799 --> 01:13:09.968
You know, the thing I'm trying
to do is what Mick done for me.

01:13:10.053 --> 01:13:13.597
He tried to keep me away from
the dirty part of the business,

01:13:13.681 --> 01:13:15.182
the way I'm trying to
do for you.

01:13:15.266 --> 01:13:17.309
Man, I ain't you!
And you ain't Mick!

01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:18.894
Man, when are you gonna
understand that?

01:13:18.978 --> 01:13:20.687
When are you gonna understand
that this is a business?

01:13:20.772 --> 01:13:21.772
In a business you need...

01:13:21.856 --> 01:13:22.856
What, brains?

01:13:22.940 --> 01:13:24.232
You said that, not me.

01:13:24.317 --> 01:13:25.984
Is that what you're saying?
You're saying I got no brains?

01:13:26.069 --> 01:13:27.611
Look, Rocky, you took me
as far as you could.

01:13:27.695 --> 01:13:29.404
But Duke gave me my
title shot, you didn't.

01:13:29.489 --> 01:13:31.031
And if you wanna keep
training me, then do it.

01:13:31.115 --> 01:13:32.240
But if you don't, don't!

01:13:32.325 --> 01:13:33.950
But it's my way or
it's the highway!

01:13:35.495 --> 01:13:36.703
Tommy!

01:13:45.463 --> 01:13:48.090
Rocky,
put on your coat.

01:13:48.174 --> 01:13:49.966
Just put on your coat.

01:13:50.051 --> 01:13:52.260
Come on.
It's not worth it.

01:13:52.345 --> 01:13:54.763
Adrian, it is worth it.
He's just confused.

01:13:54.847 --> 01:13:56.056
You don't see what's
happening under your eyes.

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:57.766
Yeah, I do see!
What... Yeah, he's...

01:13:57.850 --> 01:14:00.018
He's twisted around by Duke.
I see what's happening.

01:14:00.103 --> 01:14:02.896
No, come on, it's you, it's not
him. You can't live backwards.

01:14:02.980 --> 01:14:04.481
Come on, you can't
turn back the clocks.

01:14:04.565 --> 01:14:05.690
We live now,
we live here.

01:14:05.775 --> 01:14:07.067
Hey, Adrian,
I know where we live.

01:14:07.151 --> 01:14:08.401
What, do you think
I'm stupid?

01:14:08.486 --> 01:14:10.821
I'm not as dumb
as you think I am!

01:14:10.905 --> 01:14:13.198
Look, you don't think
I can smell it?

01:14:13.282 --> 01:14:14.866
I see where we are.

01:14:14.951 --> 01:14:16.618
Adrian, I don't want
this no more.

01:14:16.702 --> 01:14:17.953
I want something
good for the family.

01:14:18.037 --> 01:14:19.538
I don't want this.

01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:20.997
I don't want this!

01:14:21.082 --> 01:14:22.958
I mean, did I come
back here and get my

01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:24.876
brains beat out for
these guys to say,

01:14:24.961 --> 01:14:26.878
"Hey, there goes Balboa"?

01:14:26.963 --> 01:14:29.381
I'm just another bum
in the neighborhood!

01:14:29.465 --> 01:14:30.799
I didn't want this!

01:14:30.883 --> 01:14:33.593
No, come on.
Nobody says that!

01:14:33.678 --> 01:14:35.720
I'm saying it, Adrian.
I'm saying this.

01:14:35.805 --> 01:14:36.972
I'm saying this.

01:14:37.849 --> 01:14:39.808
When that kid was in the ring,
you know what I was doing?

01:14:39.892 --> 01:14:40.934
I was winning.

01:14:41.018 --> 01:14:42.144
When he was winning,
I was winning.

01:14:42.228 --> 01:14:44.062
You were winning?
Yeah. It was...

01:14:44.147 --> 01:14:45.856
It was like...
It was my last chance

01:14:45.940 --> 01:14:47.482
at getting some
respect for us.

01:14:47.567 --> 01:14:49.317
Do you know that?
Come on, I respect you.

01:14:49.402 --> 01:14:51.611
I respect you. Yes, I do. It's
gone! You can't respect me.

01:14:51.696 --> 01:14:53.280
I don't respect myself.
No, you can't do it!

01:14:53.364 --> 01:14:54.364
I do!
Don't tell me that.

01:14:54.448 --> 01:14:56.825
All those beatings
you took in the ring.

01:14:56.909 --> 01:14:58.535
I took them with you.

01:14:59.078 --> 01:15:00.287
I know how you feel.

01:15:00.371 --> 01:15:03.915
I know when somebody like Tommy
comes along, you feel alive.

01:15:04.584 --> 01:15:07.002
But he's not you. He
doesn't have your heart.

01:15:07.086 --> 01:15:11.506
All those fighters you beat, you
beat 'em with heart, not muscle.

01:15:11.591 --> 01:15:12.799
That's what Mickey knew.

01:15:12.884 --> 01:15:15.051
That's why you and
Mickey were special.

01:15:15.136 --> 01:15:16.803
But Mickey's dead!

01:15:17.513 --> 01:15:21.099
If there's something you want to
pass on, pass it on to your son.

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:24.436
For God's sakes,
your son is lost.

01:15:25.271 --> 01:15:26.563
He needs you!

01:15:27.565 --> 01:15:30.317
I know Tommy
makes you feel great.

01:15:30.401 --> 01:15:33.111
He makes you feel
like you're winning again.

01:15:33.196 --> 01:15:35.614
But you're losing us!

01:15:35.698 --> 01:15:38.074
Rocky, you're losing
your family!

01:15:45.791 --> 01:15:47.125
I'm sorry.

01:15:48.211 --> 01:15:50.378
You know it was
always you and me.

01:15:50.463 --> 01:15:52.422
It was always you and me.

01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.468
I'm sorry, Adrian.

01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:01.681
I don't know
about you guys,

01:16:02.183 --> 01:16:04.309
but I gotta get
out of here.

01:16:05.978 --> 01:16:07.896
Hey, what do you say
we go to the shore?

01:16:07.980 --> 01:16:09.064
Yeah, let's go.

01:16:09.148 --> 01:16:10.732
Yeah, great. How are we gonna get there?

01:16:10.816 --> 01:16:12.108
What do you mean
how we gonna get there?

01:16:12.193 --> 01:16:14.486
We throw our thumbs in
the air. We'll hitchhike.

01:16:15.112 --> 01:16:16.238
Yo.

01:16:16.322 --> 01:16:17.822
What's he want?

01:16:17.907 --> 01:16:19.282
You want me to
stay with you?

01:16:19.367 --> 01:16:20.408
No.

01:16:20.493 --> 01:16:23.203
Yeah, right. I got enough
problems with my old man. Come on.

01:16:25.331 --> 01:16:26.915
You ain't gonna
hit him, are you?

01:16:26.999 --> 01:16:29.167
No, I ain't gonna
hit him. No.

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:33.797
Yo, kid,
when you start smoking?

01:16:33.881 --> 01:16:35.966
I don't know.
Didn't you ever smoke?

01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:38.385
Yeah, I done a lot of
bad things, you know?

01:16:39.887 --> 01:16:40.971
So?

01:16:42.765 --> 01:16:45.642
So, I...
You know, I wised up.

01:16:45.726 --> 01:16:48.645
Okay, so maybe I'll
wise up someday, too.

01:16:50.731 --> 01:16:53.275
Maybe tonight's
a good night for

01:16:53.359 --> 01:16:55.902
both of us to start
this wising-up thing.

01:16:56.779 --> 01:16:57.862
Hey, don't worry about it.

01:16:57.947 --> 01:16:59.322
I gotta worry about it.

01:16:59.407 --> 01:17:01.908
I mean, the deal was we were
supposed to be tight, right?

01:17:01.993 --> 01:17:04.244
What about Tommy?
You tight with him too, huh?

01:17:06.414 --> 01:17:07.580
Tommy.

01:17:12.128 --> 01:17:13.503
Yeah, well.

01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:16.715
That was yesterday,
you know?

01:17:21.012 --> 01:17:22.512
You know, kid,

01:17:23.222 --> 01:17:25.348
you remember you were
telling me a long time ago

01:17:25.433 --> 01:17:26.683
about deceptions,

01:17:26.767 --> 01:17:29.269
and I was talking to you
about scams and...

01:17:29.353 --> 01:17:32.230
I should have listened to
you. I was trying to teach you.

01:17:33.024 --> 01:17:36.818
All right? But you, you were
teaching me and I didn't wise up.

01:17:36.902 --> 01:17:40.905
And I didn't know, and I made
mistakes, and I do things, you know.

01:17:42.825 --> 01:17:44.492
It bothers me, you know?

01:17:44.577 --> 01:17:45.910
I forget a lot of things.

01:17:46.495 --> 01:17:49.372
I... Just...

01:17:51.584 --> 01:17:53.001
You know, I...

01:17:59.925 --> 01:18:01.343
Hey, kid.

01:18:03.179 --> 01:18:06.097
I know I made a few mistakes,
you know? It's...

01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:09.517
But I would love to
hang out with you again.

01:18:09.977 --> 01:18:11.519
Just you and me.

01:18:15.733 --> 01:18:19.944
I swear to God, it's just
gonna be you and me this time.

01:18:22.865 --> 01:18:24.240
Home team?

01:18:26.577 --> 01:18:29.287
Yeah, home team.

01:18:32.458 --> 01:18:34.250
Hey, kid,
you wanna hear a joke?

01:18:34.335 --> 01:18:35.752
Yeah, sure. Why not?

01:18:36.379 --> 01:18:37.670
Knock, knock.

01:18:37.755 --> 01:18:39.005
Who's there?

01:18:39.090 --> 01:18:40.298
Tuna fish.

01:18:40.383 --> 01:18:42.050
Tuna fish who?

01:18:42.134 --> 01:18:45.845
You can tune a piano,
but you cannot tune a fish.

01:18:45.930 --> 01:18:47.889
Well,
you're getting better.

01:18:47.973 --> 01:18:49.974
Yeah,
that's a good one.

01:18:56.273 --> 01:18:58.983
All right, folks. Lock
the door and hide the kids.

01:18:59.068 --> 01:19:01.277
It's time to wage war!

01:19:03.781 --> 01:19:04.948
Tommy Gunn has been said

01:19:05.032 --> 01:19:07.158
to be such a student
of Rocky Balboa's style,

01:19:07.243 --> 01:19:09.744
he's been nicknamed by
the press the Clone Ranger.

01:19:09.829 --> 01:19:11.621
In the red corner...

01:19:11.705 --> 01:19:14.165
Relax, Rocko. He ain't worth the stress.

01:19:14.250 --> 01:19:17.085
It ain't him, Paulie.
It ain't him.

01:19:17.169 --> 01:19:18.169
Turbo-charged.

01:19:18.254 --> 01:19:22.006
Tommy "The Machine" Gunn!

01:19:22.091 --> 01:19:23.341
Tommy Gunn.

01:19:27.596 --> 01:19:30.223
Boy, looks like the fans
are unhappy with Tommy Gunn

01:19:30.307 --> 01:19:32.142
for leaving
Rocky Balboa behind.

01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:35.895
Yeah, of course. He's
nobody's sweetheart, that kid.

01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:40.066
Weighing in at 242
very impressive pounds,

01:19:40.484 --> 01:19:46.865
the present world heavyweight
champion, Union Cane!

01:19:48.200 --> 01:19:49.826
Looks like he's in great
shape, don't he, Paulie?

01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:50.952
Yeah.

01:19:51.036 --> 01:19:52.704
And the referee,
Capaccito, calling

01:19:52.788 --> 01:19:54.414
both fighters to
the center of the ring.

01:19:54.498 --> 01:19:56.624
Whoa, Tommy, you're
looking... He's a little tight.

01:19:56.709 --> 01:19:58.668
He's nervous, you know?

01:19:58.752 --> 01:20:01.629
Like the way I felt when I was
fighting with Apollo, you know?

01:20:01.714 --> 01:20:04.132
Rocko, he ain't you.
Hardly ever was, that kid.

01:20:04.216 --> 01:20:05.758
Hey, come on. Give
him a break, would you?

01:20:13.142 --> 01:20:15.393
All right, come on, Tommy.
Do what you was told.

01:20:15.478 --> 01:20:17.770
In and out, side to side.
Don't eat the jab.

01:20:21.233 --> 01:20:22.775
Get off the ropes!
What are you, blind?

01:20:24.987 --> 01:20:26.946
Well, he's getting hit with
everything but the ring posts.

01:20:27.031 --> 01:20:28.781
Come on, Cane. Let's
rumble. Go for it, Cane.

01:20:28.866 --> 01:20:32.285
Come on, Tommy, what's the
matter with you? That's it!

01:20:37.917 --> 01:20:39.042
That's it!

01:20:39.919 --> 01:20:42.462
Slip the jab, move.
Move that, side to side.

01:20:42.546 --> 01:20:43.880
Back and forth,
like a metronome.

01:20:43.964 --> 01:20:45.507
Slip, slide, glide.

01:20:45.591 --> 01:20:46.966
That's it!

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:52.305
Jab!

01:21:00.314 --> 01:21:02.941
You see what...
He remembers everything.

01:21:03.817 --> 01:21:05.151
All right.
Come on, Tommy.

01:21:05.236 --> 01:21:06.736
I'm in there, man.
Do what I'm doing.

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:09.656
Do what I'm doing. Back and
forth, side to side, that's it!

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:16.120
Come on! Come on!

01:21:16.205 --> 01:21:18.373
Come on, kid! Don't let
him up! Don't let him up!

01:21:18.457 --> 01:21:20.250
Roll, roll, roll!

01:21:25.297 --> 01:21:26.631
Dig, dig!

01:21:37.101 --> 01:21:38.810
Got him! He's down!
The heavyweight champion

01:21:38.894 --> 01:21:40.186
Union Cane is down!

01:21:43.023 --> 01:21:46.150
One, two, three,

01:21:46.235 --> 01:21:47.318
four.

01:21:47.403 --> 01:21:48.528
Five.

01:21:48.612 --> 01:21:50.947
Six, seven.
What are you doing?

01:21:51.031 --> 01:21:52.073
Eight.

01:21:52.157 --> 01:21:53.157
Nine!

01:21:53.242 --> 01:21:54.909
Ten! You're out!

01:21:54.994 --> 01:21:56.077
Yeah!

01:21:56.161 --> 01:21:57.662
Yo! Yo!

01:21:57.746 --> 01:21:59.747
The heavyweight champion,
Tommy...

01:22:01.834 --> 01:22:02.875
Yeah!

01:22:04.336 --> 01:22:07.380
Ladies and gentlemen,
by way of a knockout,

01:22:07.464 --> 01:22:12.844
we have a new champion,
Tommy "The Machine" Gunn.

01:22:16.849 --> 01:22:19.601
Congratulations.
A sensational upset victory.

01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:22.270
And you're now the champion
of the world. How do you feel?

01:22:22.354 --> 01:22:23.730
Never better.
I mean, I don't know

01:22:23.814 --> 01:22:25.148
what's wrong with
these people, but...

01:22:25.232 --> 01:22:29.277
Because you're not a champion.
You're a crumb bug dirtbag.

01:22:29.361 --> 01:22:30.528
Hey, come on,
Paul, give him a break.

01:22:30.613 --> 01:22:33.823
He did something wonderful.

01:22:33.907 --> 01:22:36.451
Long live the king!
Yes!

01:22:36.535 --> 01:22:37.619
I'd like to say thank you.

01:22:37.703 --> 01:22:40.455
I'd like to thank the
man that made this happen,

01:22:40.539 --> 01:22:42.290
and I'd like to thank the
man who made me believe

01:22:42.374 --> 01:22:43.791
that all this
could happen,

01:22:43.876 --> 01:22:46.127
the man who's been like
an angel on my shoulder,

01:22:46.211 --> 01:22:47.754
Mr. George Washington Duke!

01:22:47.838 --> 01:22:48.880
Yeah!

01:22:50.716 --> 01:22:52.008
And there you have it.

01:22:52.092 --> 01:22:55.887
A new champion of the world,
Tommy "The Machine" Gunn.

01:22:55.971 --> 01:22:58.640
Boy, I'll tell you, a big
surprise, at least to me,

01:22:58.724 --> 01:23:00.767
that the new champion
thanked Duke

01:23:00.851 --> 01:23:02.101
instead of the guy
that got him here.

01:23:02.186 --> 01:23:03.144
Yeah.

01:23:03.228 --> 01:23:04.479
This crowd is unhappy.

01:23:04.563 --> 01:23:09.442
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

01:23:09.526 --> 01:23:11.361
Rocko, too much TV
is bad for the eyes.

01:23:11.445 --> 01:23:13.029
No, my eyes are okay,
Paulie. Sit.

01:23:14.031 --> 01:23:15.990
Well, too much TV
is bad for my ears.

01:23:16.075 --> 01:23:17.200
Yeah.

01:23:17.785 --> 01:23:19.786
Hey, hi, slugger.
Good fight, huh?

01:23:19.912 --> 01:23:21.204
It's okay, dad.

01:23:21.288 --> 01:23:23.706
You're the real champ around
here. I made this for you.

01:23:23.791 --> 01:23:25.124
Yeah?

01:23:26.168 --> 01:23:27.502
Beautiful.

01:23:28.754 --> 01:23:31.339
Rocko, let's put our teeth
around a few brews, okay?

01:23:31.423 --> 01:23:32.632
I could use the company.

01:23:32.716 --> 01:23:34.092
Sure.
Yeah, good idea.

01:23:36.136 --> 01:23:37.845
Think I should go out
with your uncle Paulie?

01:23:37.930 --> 01:23:39.055
If I can watch TV.

01:23:39.139 --> 01:23:41.641
Yeah, hey, okay,
listen.

01:23:41.725 --> 01:23:43.184
Yeah, you can
watch TV, okay?

01:23:43.268 --> 01:23:44.519
But don't stay up too late.

01:23:44.603 --> 01:23:45.937
You gotta get
them bones growing.

01:23:46.021 --> 01:23:47.772
All right.
Okay.

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:51.317
Wow, what a fight.
That was something.

01:23:51.402 --> 01:23:52.860
Yeah, something.

01:23:52.945 --> 01:23:54.028
Jeez.

01:23:54.113 --> 01:23:55.530
I told you you could
give him everything

01:23:55.614 --> 01:23:57.990
but you can't
give him your heart.

01:23:58.075 --> 01:24:00.243
It's okay, Adrian,
really.

01:24:00.327 --> 01:24:01.327
Yeah?

01:24:01.412 --> 01:24:02.870
Yeah, it's all right.

01:24:04.164 --> 01:24:08.209
It's... Hey, kid, don't
you stay up too late, okay?

01:24:09.461 --> 01:24:10.795
That was some fight.

01:24:12.423 --> 01:24:13.965
Are you okay?

01:24:14.049 --> 01:24:15.299
Sure.

01:24:17.219 --> 01:24:18.970
I won't be out too late.
Okay.

01:24:20.097 --> 01:24:21.389
See you, champ.

01:24:21.473 --> 01:24:24.308
Yeah, yeah. Have a good
time with Uncle Paulie.

01:24:24.393 --> 01:24:25.810
Yeah, sure.

01:24:31.984 --> 01:24:33.943
Ladies and gentlemen, let
me present to you the newest,

01:24:34.027 --> 01:24:36.404
the youngest heavyweight
champion of all time,

01:24:36.488 --> 01:24:38.698
Tommy "The Machine" Gunn!

01:24:38.782 --> 01:24:40.324
Yeah!

01:24:40.409 --> 01:24:42.076
Do you think
the fight was too easy?

01:24:42.161 --> 01:24:43.995
He hit me a few good shots.
But I was never hurt.

01:24:44.079 --> 01:24:46.205
I mean, I'm just glad
to be the champ. Yeah!

01:24:46.290 --> 01:24:48.124
Tommy, don't you think
that this looked more like

01:24:48.208 --> 01:24:49.917
a Philadelphia
sparring session at times

01:24:50.002 --> 01:24:51.711
instead of
a championship match?

01:24:51.795 --> 01:24:53.045
It didn't look like
you broke a sweat.

01:24:53.130 --> 01:24:54.589
Yeah,
you're very observant.

01:24:54.673 --> 01:24:56.716
Union Cane wasn't
feeling that good.

01:24:56.800 --> 01:24:59.135
But Tommy Gunn would
have done the same thing

01:24:59.219 --> 01:25:01.471
if Union was 100%.
Next.

01:25:01.555 --> 01:25:04.932
100%? He fought like he didn't
have a heartbeat. Come on!

01:25:05.017 --> 01:25:06.976
Everybody knows that Cane
is just a paper champion.

01:25:07.060 --> 01:25:08.436
What does he mean
by "paper champion"?

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:10.521
It means Cane's title
was manufactured.

01:25:10.606 --> 01:25:11.773
He never won it from Balboa.

01:25:11.857 --> 01:25:14.066
Gentlemen, give the boy a
break. Union Cane is for real.

01:25:14.151 --> 01:25:15.526
Tommy, you ever think
you're gonna get out

01:25:15.611 --> 01:25:17.111
from underneath
Rocky Balboa's shadow?

01:25:17.196 --> 01:25:18.988
Man, I won the title.
What more do I have to do?

01:25:19.072 --> 01:25:20.573
I'll tell you
what you have to do,

01:25:20.657 --> 01:25:22.575
you've gotta fight some
real opponents, right?

01:25:22.701 --> 01:25:25.119
Balboa fought them all.
But I beat the best tonight.

01:25:25.204 --> 01:25:26.788
The best? The best?
This guy's a bum.

01:25:26.872 --> 01:25:28.664
He doesn't even deserve
a shot at the title.

01:25:28.749 --> 01:25:30.249
Gentlemen,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:25:30.334 --> 01:25:31.417
We're getting carried away.

01:25:31.502 --> 01:25:34.212
Now, Union Cane was the
recognized champ. Next question.

01:25:34.296 --> 01:25:36.881
We know the rating system
can be manipulated.

01:25:36.965 --> 01:25:39.801
The bottom line is Tommy Gunn
beat a second-rate fighter

01:25:39.885 --> 01:25:42.303
with so much glass in his jaw,
he ought to be a chandelier.

01:25:42.387 --> 01:25:43.471
Say what you want,

01:25:43.555 --> 01:25:46.182
but this man will prove
to be a great champion.

01:25:46.266 --> 01:25:49.393
He might win a few fights, but
a Rocky Balboa he'll never be.

01:25:49.478 --> 01:25:50.853
No, no, no.

01:25:50.938 --> 01:25:52.605
He's no Rocky Balboa.
Let's face it.

01:25:52.689 --> 01:25:53.815
There is only one Balboa.

01:25:53.899 --> 01:25:56.067
Now, Balboa was
a true people's champion.

01:25:56.151 --> 01:25:57.860
But in time,
Tommy Gunn may be

01:25:57.945 --> 01:25:59.987
able to fill his shoes.
Next question.

01:26:00.072 --> 01:26:02.615
Not by fighting
stiffs like Cane, he won't.

01:26:02.699 --> 01:26:04.325
Man, I'll fight anybody anywhere!

01:26:04.409 --> 01:26:07.161
Who? When? When are you
gonna fight a real fighter?

01:26:07.246 --> 01:26:08.871
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
gentlemen, come on.

01:26:08.956 --> 01:26:11.833
We want to thank you for coming
tonight, and we'll look forward...

01:26:11.917 --> 01:26:14.085
Hey, Tommy,
I got something for you.

01:26:14.169 --> 01:26:16.671
For your next fight, why don't you
fight the redhead in the front row?

01:26:16.797 --> 01:26:18.256
I hear she comes
real cheap.

01:26:19.925 --> 01:26:23.594
We look forward to seeing you
at Tommy Gunn's next fight.

01:26:24.179 --> 01:26:26.180
Why the hell did you say
Balboa was better, man?

01:26:26.265 --> 01:26:27.640
Do you believe he's better?
Of course not.

01:26:27.724 --> 01:26:28.933
But we can't
talk in here, huh?

01:26:29.017 --> 01:26:30.184
You the champ.
You the champ.

01:26:30.269 --> 01:26:32.103
Who are you gonna fight
for the next fight, Tommy?

01:26:32.980 --> 01:26:34.772
Man, what the hell
happened in there?

01:26:34.857 --> 01:26:37.275
I won the damn title, and
these people think I'm a bum!

01:26:37.359 --> 01:26:39.026
Man, why didn't you
take up for me in there?

01:26:39.111 --> 01:26:40.695
Listen to me, when the press
is right, they're right.

01:26:40.779 --> 01:26:42.446
Right? Man, I'm as good
as Balboa ever was.

01:26:42.531 --> 01:26:43.698
I don't give a damn
about what they say.

01:26:43.782 --> 01:26:45.324
And I'm tired of being
called a damn robot, too!

01:26:45.409 --> 01:26:46.993
Listen to me, Tommy Gunn.
You can't fight the press.

01:26:47.077 --> 01:26:48.077
I can't fight the press.

01:26:48.161 --> 01:26:49.203
Oh, God!

01:26:49.288 --> 01:26:52.248
As long as they got Balboa on
the brain, he'll always be champ.

01:26:52.332 --> 01:26:53.374
The man fought
wars in the ring.

01:26:53.458 --> 01:26:54.417
Tommy, face facts.

01:26:54.501 --> 01:26:56.168
You're in his shadow. I don't
know if there's any way out.

01:26:56.253 --> 01:26:57.253
This is your own man talking!

01:26:57.337 --> 01:26:58.504
No, no, no!
Listen to me.

01:26:58.589 --> 01:27:00.506
There's a way for you to
get the respect you deserve,

01:27:00.591 --> 01:27:03.634
but what you've got to do is
challenge Balboa to fight man-to-man.

01:27:03.719 --> 01:27:05.261
That's right. George here
could set this fight up abroad

01:27:05.345 --> 01:27:06.679
in a matter of weeks.

01:27:06.763 --> 01:27:08.180
Yeah, it'd be the greatest fight ever.

01:27:08.265 --> 01:27:09.473
Teacher against student.

01:27:09.558 --> 01:27:11.517
Old lion against young lion.

01:27:11.602 --> 01:27:13.436
And it's the only way you're
ever gonna get peace of mind,

01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:14.729
'cause believe me
when I tell you

01:27:14.813 --> 01:27:17.023
that press is gonna hound you
with that man's legend

01:27:17.107 --> 01:27:19.317
for as long as you dare
to wear boxing gloves.

01:27:19.401 --> 01:27:21.611
You've got to get him
into that ring, Tommy Gunn,

01:27:21.695 --> 01:27:23.404
or you're gonna be hearing
questions like you heard tonight

01:27:23.488 --> 01:27:24.572
for the rest of your life.

01:27:24.656 --> 01:27:27.074
Then you're gonna start to ask
yourself, "Could I really take him?

01:27:27.159 --> 01:27:28.409
"Am I really good enough?

01:27:28.493 --> 01:27:30.578
"Do people really think
I'm a cheap carbon copy

01:27:30.662 --> 01:27:32.246
"or a second-rate
pretender who only

01:27:32.331 --> 01:27:35.041
"got a shot
because of my skin tone?"

01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:37.793
You've got to challenge that
man to fight, Tommy Gunn.

01:27:37.878 --> 01:27:40.254
And if he refuses,
then you gotta insult him!

01:27:40.339 --> 01:27:42.798
You gotta dog him.
You gotta humiliate him.

01:27:42.883 --> 01:27:45.051
You gotta do whatever you got
to do to get him into that ring,

01:27:45.135 --> 01:27:46.969
but that's what
you got to do.

01:27:52.434 --> 01:27:55.519
Okay, blast off.
Rolling silver.

01:27:55.604 --> 01:27:58.940
And down. Yo, Andy! Andy,
flippers ain't flipping. Yo, Andy.

01:27:59.024 --> 01:28:00.733
Hey, that machine
cost me a fortune.

01:28:00.817 --> 01:28:03.444
Yeah, well, it's costing me
a fortune, too, you know?

01:28:03.528 --> 01:28:05.446
Rocky Balboa.

01:28:05.530 --> 01:28:06.489
What the hell
was that?

01:28:06.573 --> 01:28:09.951
Rocky Balboa, there's a man out
here wishing to speak with you.

01:28:10.035 --> 01:28:11.702
Rocky Balboa!

01:28:14.081 --> 01:28:15.623
Rocko, you know who that is?

01:28:15.707 --> 01:28:16.832
Ain't that the Duke?

01:28:16.917 --> 01:28:18.292
Yeah, I know who that is.

01:28:20.963 --> 01:28:22.630
Rocky, you need
some help?

01:28:22.714 --> 01:28:25.466
No, guys, it ain't
no pie-eating contest.

01:28:29.096 --> 01:28:30.763
Look what's
in the street.

01:28:31.306 --> 01:28:32.848
Yo, Tommy,
what are you doing here?

01:28:32.933 --> 01:28:34.809
You ought to be out there
celebrating, right?

01:28:34.893 --> 01:28:36.227
No, I'm challenging you
to a fight.

01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:38.437
Anytime, anyplace,
anywhere.

01:28:38.522 --> 01:28:40.356
Fight?
That's right.

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:42.942
You're coming down here
with these people,

01:28:43.026 --> 01:28:44.026
asking me if I wanna

01:28:44.111 --> 01:28:45.820
throw hands with you?
Is that what this is about?

01:28:45.904 --> 01:28:46.904
Yeah,
that's what it's about.

01:28:46.989 --> 01:28:49.532
And I ain't nobody's
robot! Nobody's boy!

01:28:49.616 --> 01:28:51.617
Now, are you accepting the
challenge, or are you yellow?

01:28:53.203 --> 01:28:54.996
He has no class.
Come on, Rock.

01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:57.456
Hey. He has no class. Come on.

01:28:58.458 --> 01:29:00.126
Let's go inside.
Come on.

01:29:07.300 --> 01:29:09.510
You know, Paulie,
it ain't him, you know?

01:29:09.594 --> 01:29:10.761
You wanna shoot some
eight-ball or something?

01:29:10.846 --> 01:29:13.973
Hey! Man, I ain't through
talking with you yet.

01:29:14.057 --> 01:29:16.851
Hey, look, Tommy, I ain't got
no more to say to you, okay?

01:29:16.935 --> 01:29:18.561
Look, I just wanted good
things for you, all right?

01:29:18.645 --> 01:29:20.521
Hell you did. Man, you were
only in this for the money.

01:29:20.605 --> 01:29:21.605
Money?

01:29:21.690 --> 01:29:22.690
Yeah, I'm tired of walking
around in your shadow, man,

01:29:22.774 --> 01:29:23.899
people calling me
your robot.

01:29:23.984 --> 01:29:26.360
You thought I was in this
for the money, Tommy?

01:29:26.445 --> 01:29:28.863
You know, we were supposed
to be like brothers, you know?

01:29:28.947 --> 01:29:30.072
You don't remember that?

01:29:30.157 --> 01:29:32.742
You don't know this, but you
got a deception going here.

01:29:32.826 --> 01:29:35.369
This guy here. He was
using you for the bait.

01:29:35.454 --> 01:29:37.204
He wants to get you
and me in the ring.

01:29:37.289 --> 01:29:39.248
That's what he wants, us to
fight each other, you know?

01:29:39.332 --> 01:29:40.583
To make the money, right?

01:29:40.667 --> 01:29:42.168
He don't care
about you, Tommy.

01:29:42.252 --> 01:29:44.128
He don't care about me
neither, right?

01:29:44.212 --> 01:29:46.756
Come on, come on. Enough of
the fantasy. Let's talk reality.

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:50.634
Rocky Balboa, are you prepared
to accept Tommy Gunn's challenge?

01:29:50.719 --> 01:29:52.053
Tommy.
All right.

01:29:52.137 --> 01:29:53.262
Hey!

01:29:53.305 --> 01:29:55.347
Hey, man, I would've taken you
any time. Come on. Let's go.

01:29:55.432 --> 01:29:57.224
Hey, Tommy, you're a piece
of garbage, you know that?

01:29:57.309 --> 01:29:58.726
This ain't
none of your business!

01:29:58.810 --> 01:30:00.394
Ain't none of my business?
Hey, come on, Paulie.

01:30:00.479 --> 01:30:01.604
Ain't none of my business?

01:30:01.688 --> 01:30:03.647
Paulie, forget about it.
The man spit blood for you,

01:30:03.732 --> 01:30:05.357
put you ahead of
his own family,

01:30:05.442 --> 01:30:09.320
and you bring these rat bums
around here and kill his dignity?

01:30:09.404 --> 01:30:11.906
Rocko made you your shot, you
know that? He's the real champ.

01:30:11.990 --> 01:30:13.574
You're just a goddamn joke.

01:30:13.658 --> 01:30:15.201
Now, just get out of here
before I break your face.

01:30:15.285 --> 01:30:17.203
Tommy! Tommy,
come on!

01:30:17.913 --> 01:30:19.163
Paulie!

01:30:20.248 --> 01:30:21.290
What?

01:30:21.374 --> 01:30:23.209
Break your hand on this bum,
and what are you worth then?

01:30:23.293 --> 01:30:24.877
Paulie, are you okay?

01:30:24.961 --> 01:30:27.004
You should have left him on
the street where you found him.

01:30:27.089 --> 01:30:28.089
Get off me, man!

01:30:28.173 --> 01:30:29.423
Right.
Get him out of here.

01:30:29.508 --> 01:30:30.633
Merlin, Merlin,
get him out of here!

01:30:30.717 --> 01:30:31.759
Merlin!

01:30:31.843 --> 01:30:32.885
Get off me!
Get him out of here!

01:30:32.969 --> 01:30:34.512
Get him out of here! Merlin!
Tommy!

01:30:34.596 --> 01:30:36.013
Get off me!

01:30:37.015 --> 01:30:40.101
Now you knocked him down. Why
don't you try knocking me down now?

01:30:40.185 --> 01:30:41.602
No, no, in the ring,
in the ring.

01:30:41.686 --> 01:30:43.312
Tommy Gunn only
fights in the ring.

01:30:43.396 --> 01:30:44.522
Come on,
let's get out of here.

01:30:44.606 --> 01:30:45.773
My ring's outside.

01:30:45.857 --> 01:30:48.776
Yeah? Let's do it.
Come on!

01:30:48.860 --> 01:30:49.944
Tommy! Tommy!

01:30:50.028 --> 01:30:51.695
Let's go live!
Go live!

01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:54.031
Come on, Rocky. Kill this
here punk. He's nothing.

01:30:54.116 --> 01:30:56.117
Tear him down.
You gotta take him down.

01:30:56.743 --> 01:30:58.077
Just take him right down.

01:30:58.161 --> 01:30:59.787
He's a bum, Rocky, I'm telling you.

01:30:59.871 --> 01:31:01.038
Balboa is
a street fighter.

01:31:01.123 --> 01:31:02.248
You a prize fighter.

01:31:02.332 --> 01:31:04.125
Don't be a damn fool!
Hey, you don't own me!

01:31:04.209 --> 01:31:05.876
Take it easy, Tommy!
You don't own me!

01:31:05.961 --> 01:31:07.628
What the hell is wrong
with you? Take it easy!

01:31:07.712 --> 01:31:09.255
Nobody does.

01:31:09.339 --> 01:31:10.631
I want my respect.
Tommy.

01:31:10.715 --> 01:31:13.008
Well, come and get it.
Come on, Tommy.

01:31:13.677 --> 01:31:15.010
Come on, Rocky.

01:31:24.896 --> 01:31:27.648
I loved you, man.
Do you know that?

01:31:27.732 --> 01:31:31.318
You and me were supposed
to be like this, Tommy.

01:31:31.736 --> 01:31:33.195
You blew it!

01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:34.405
You...

01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:40.411
You're always champ, Rocky.

01:31:43.498 --> 01:31:45.916
Lucky punch. Lucky punch!
But he's a street fighter.

01:31:46.001 --> 01:31:48.210
And I told you never to fight
a street-fighting fight.

01:31:48.295 --> 01:31:50.045
Come on, let's get out
of here. Come on, come on.

01:31:50.130 --> 01:31:51.714
You're always the champ,
Rocky. Great.

01:31:52.507 --> 01:31:55.009
Hey! Rock, watch out!

01:32:03.852 --> 01:32:04.852
Somebody...

01:32:06.146 --> 01:32:09.190
Rocky! Come on,
Rock! Rocky, come on!

01:32:09.274 --> 01:32:11.567
Get out of it, Rocky!
Come on!

01:32:12.360 --> 01:32:13.944
Get him, Rocky!

01:32:16.907 --> 01:32:18.616
Come on, Rocky!

01:32:22.245 --> 01:32:24.079
Rocky, get out of it!

01:32:24.664 --> 01:32:25.956
I got it!

01:32:26.041 --> 01:32:27.708
Rocky!
Come on, Rocky!

01:32:27.792 --> 01:32:29.543
Rock! Get up, Rocky!

01:32:29.628 --> 01:32:31.712
This is great stuff!
This is beautiful!

01:32:32.088 --> 01:32:34.757
Mom! Mom! It's Dad.

01:32:34.841 --> 01:32:36.091
He's on television.
He's fighting.

01:32:36.176 --> 01:32:37.301
What?

01:32:38.303 --> 01:32:41.597
Come on, man! Come on!
Ready to fight me? Come on!

01:32:42.432 --> 01:32:44.767
Come on, Balboa.
Who's your puppet now?

01:32:45.685 --> 01:32:47.228
Come on!

01:32:47.312 --> 01:32:48.771
Get out of it, Rocky!
Get him, Rock!

01:32:52.275 --> 01:32:54.318
Come on! Come on!

01:32:54.611 --> 01:32:56.362
Come on! Come on!

01:32:58.198 --> 01:32:59.240
Come on!

01:33:06.081 --> 01:33:07.248
Rocky,
you gotta get up.

01:33:07.332 --> 01:33:08.415
Come on! Get up!

01:33:14.881 --> 01:33:16.507
Come on.
What's the matter, Rock?

01:33:22.264 --> 01:33:23.472
Rocky!

01:33:25.767 --> 01:33:26.976
You're out!

01:33:29.354 --> 01:33:31.313
And if he dies, he dies.

01:33:31.773 --> 01:33:34.358
You're the champ!
Now get up! One more round.

01:33:35.610 --> 01:33:37.236
Come on, Balboa!

01:33:38.196 --> 01:33:40.656
Get up! Don't lay down!
Fight this guy hard!

01:33:40.740 --> 01:33:42.533
Come on! Come on!

01:33:43.076 --> 01:33:45.244
He's no machine.
I didn't hear no bell!

01:33:45.328 --> 01:33:49.164
Get up, you son of a bitch,
'cause Mickey loves ya.

01:33:52.252 --> 01:33:54.295
Come on, boy. It's all
right. You the champ.

01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:02.136
Yo, Tommy!

01:34:05.473 --> 01:34:07.057
I didn't hear no bell.

01:34:08.184 --> 01:34:10.185
Tommy. One more round.

01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:12.438
Tommy, come on. Get back. Get back, boy!

01:34:12.522 --> 01:34:13.731
Tommy,
you don't need this.

01:34:13.815 --> 01:34:15.399
Tommy, you lose,
you're finished!

01:34:15.483 --> 01:34:17.151
I got one more round.
Come on!

01:34:18.069 --> 01:34:19.737
I'm not gonna knock
you out this time.

01:34:20.530 --> 01:34:22.323
I'm gonna put you
through the street.

01:34:22.407 --> 01:34:23.532
One more round.

01:34:24.242 --> 01:34:26.910
Come on, Rocky!
Come on, Rock!

01:34:35.754 --> 01:34:37.087
Come on, Tommy.

01:34:42.761 --> 01:34:44.094
Come on, get up.

01:34:59.277 --> 01:35:00.778
Come on! Get it!

01:35:02.322 --> 01:35:04.323
Come on, Tommy!
Come on! Come on!

01:35:13.416 --> 01:35:15.000
Touch me and I'll sue.

01:35:17.504 --> 01:35:18.962
All right, Rocky.
You've done it.

01:35:20.965 --> 01:35:22.549
What in
the hell are you doing?

01:35:22.634 --> 01:35:24.468
Get up! What in the hell?

01:35:27.430 --> 01:35:28.639
Rocko!
Let's get home.

01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:34.061
That's it, Rocky!

01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:51.286
Come on, knock the bum out!
He took my room!

01:35:51.371 --> 01:35:53.038
Your right.
Throw your right!

01:35:55.750 --> 01:35:57.668
Jab, jab, come on!

01:35:59.796 --> 01:36:02.297
You're losing everything!
Come on!

01:36:04.175 --> 01:36:05.634
Come on, Dad!
You can beat him!

01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:12.015
Fight back, you bum!
Fight back!

01:36:20.358 --> 01:36:21.525
Stop!

01:36:23.027 --> 01:36:24.236
Rocky!

01:36:25.196 --> 01:36:27.030
Come on, get that...

01:36:27.532 --> 01:36:29.283
Come on, Dad!
Go for it!

01:36:32.495 --> 01:36:34.955
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

01:36:35.039 --> 01:36:36.707
Hit him, Dad, come on!

01:36:46.843 --> 01:36:48.260
Hit him, Dad, come on!

01:36:49.929 --> 01:36:52.723
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

01:36:55.894 --> 01:36:57.227
Go for it!

01:37:11.284 --> 01:37:12.284
Dad!

01:37:12.952 --> 01:37:16.497
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

01:37:17.749 --> 01:37:20.584
Hey, Adrian, you were right.
You were right.

01:37:24.839 --> 01:37:26.590
God damn.

01:37:28.968 --> 01:37:30.385
Only in America.

01:37:37.060 --> 01:37:40.145
Hey, Rock, you outclassed the bum, huh?

01:37:43.608 --> 01:37:46.026
Yeah. Yeah.

01:37:46.110 --> 01:37:47.945
Rocky, come on.
Don't.

01:37:48.029 --> 01:37:49.112
Duke.

01:37:50.782 --> 01:37:52.449
Touch me and I'll sue.

01:37:54.702 --> 01:37:56.036
Come on, punk.

01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:58.247
Touch me and I'll sue.

01:38:07.966 --> 01:38:09.466
Sue me for what?

01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:15.305
Rocky! Rocky!

01:38:17.809 --> 01:38:19.184
Hey, yo, father.

01:38:21.145 --> 01:38:22.896
I love it
when he does that.

01:38:24.148 --> 01:38:27.859
Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!

01:38:40.540 --> 01:38:42.416
Come on, Dad.
We're gonna be late.

01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:45.002
Come on, Speedy Gonzales! Come on!

01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:50.716
Come on, Dad. You can
do better than that.

01:38:50.800 --> 01:38:51.925
No way.

01:38:53.136 --> 01:38:54.595
I don't know.
It's like these steps

01:38:54.679 --> 01:38:56.471
keep growing
taller every year.

01:38:56.556 --> 01:38:58.015
My goodness!

01:38:59.601 --> 01:39:00.934
Look at this thing, kid.

01:39:01.019 --> 01:39:02.519
As long as this
thing is here,

01:39:02.604 --> 01:39:05.272
pigeons is always gonna
have a place to sit, right?

01:39:05.356 --> 01:39:06.648
I can't believe it,
you know?

01:39:06.733 --> 01:39:08.900
And this is where it
all started for me, kid.

01:39:08.985 --> 01:39:10.652
Running up and down
these steps, you know?

01:39:10.737 --> 01:39:11.820
Dad.

01:39:11.904 --> 01:39:13.739
Yeah?
Dad, we're gonna be late.

01:39:13.823 --> 01:39:15.282
Yeah, okay.

01:39:15.366 --> 01:39:17.451
Hey, wait a minute.
What's wrong with your ear?

01:39:17.535 --> 01:39:18.619
What's wrong with it?

01:39:18.703 --> 01:39:21.622
You got something growing in
your ear. You got like a bump.

01:39:21.706 --> 01:39:23.790
What bump?

01:39:23.875 --> 01:39:25.167
This bump.

01:39:29.213 --> 01:39:30.631
Thanks, Dad.

01:39:30.715 --> 01:39:32.132
Hey, you deserve it.

01:39:32.216 --> 01:39:33.884
Thank you for being born.

01:39:34.719 --> 01:39:36.511
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

01:39:37.388 --> 01:39:39.598
What do you think?
The new me?

01:39:40.183 --> 01:39:41.808
Well,

01:39:41.893 --> 01:39:44.019
you look like the daughter
that I always wanted.

01:39:44.103 --> 01:39:46.146
What are you talking about?
Yo, yo.

01:39:46.230 --> 01:39:49.316
Hey, now, don't punch me.
I'm getting brittle as it is.

01:39:49.400 --> 01:39:50.776
Look at this, you know.

01:39:50.860 --> 01:39:53.695
I've been running up and
down these steps for 20 years,

01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:55.781
and I never knew
there was valuable pictures

01:39:55.865 --> 01:39:57.157
in this building,
you know?

01:39:57.241 --> 01:39:58.825
Well, you're never too
old to learn something new.

01:39:58.910 --> 01:39:59.951
Yeah.

01:40:00.036 --> 01:40:01.662
You're gonna love Picasso.
Yeah?

01:40:01.746 --> 01:40:04.289
Yeah, well,
I love almost everybody.

01:40:15.009 --> 01:40:18.011
These battered hands
are all you own

01:40:21.766 --> 01:40:25.727
This broken heart
has turned to stone

01:40:28.690 --> 01:40:32.442
Go hang your
glory on the wall

01:40:32.527 --> 01:40:36.029
There comes a time
when castles fall

01:40:37.990 --> 01:40:42.744
And all that's left
is shifting in the sand

01:40:44.205 --> 01:40:47.374
You're out of time,
you're out of place

01:40:47.458 --> 01:40:49.668
Look at your face

01:40:49.752 --> 01:40:53.380
That's the measure
of a man

01:40:59.178 --> 01:41:02.472
This coat that fits you
like a glove

01:41:05.935 --> 01:41:09.312
These dirty streets
you learned to love

01:41:12.608 --> 01:41:16.069
So welcome back
my long-lost friend

01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:19.072
You've been to hell
and back again

01:41:21.909 --> 01:41:26.621
And God alone knows
how you've crossed that span

01:41:27.999 --> 01:41:31.251
Back on the beat,
back to the start

01:41:31.335 --> 01:41:33.378
Trusting your heart

01:41:33.463 --> 01:41:37.048
That's the measure
of a man

01:41:42.597 --> 01:41:46.433
It's the fire in the eyes,
the lines on the hand

01:41:46.517 --> 01:41:49.478
It's the things
you understand

01:41:49.562 --> 01:41:53.106
Permanent ties
from which you once ran

01:41:53.191 --> 01:41:57.068
That's the measure
of a man

01:41:59.697 --> 01:42:02.824
You've come full circle
and now you're home

01:42:06.412 --> 01:42:09.790
Without the gold,
without the chrome

01:42:13.085 --> 01:42:16.588
And this is the way
you've always been

01:42:16.672 --> 01:42:19.591
You had to lose
so you could win

01:42:22.345 --> 01:42:26.932
Rise above your troubles
while you can

01:42:28.392 --> 01:42:31.478
Now you can love,
now you can lose

01:42:31.562 --> 01:42:33.814
Now you can choose

01:42:33.898 --> 01:42:37.567
That's the measure
of a man

01:42:43.282 --> 01:42:46.660
It's the fire in the eyes,
the lines on the hand

01:42:46.744 --> 01:42:49.955
It's the things
you understand

01:42:50.039 --> 01:42:53.875
The permanent ties
from which you once ran

01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:57.546
That's the measure
of a man

01:43:13.563 --> 01:43:16.898
You've come full circle,
now you're home

01:43:20.361 --> 01:43:24.114
Without the gold
without the chrome

01:43:26.909 --> 01:43:30.704
And this is where
you've always been

01:43:30.788 --> 01:43:33.999
You had to lose
so you could win

01:43:36.210 --> 01:43:40.297
And rise above your troubles
while you can

01:43:42.174 --> 01:43:45.343
Now you can love,
now you can lose

01:43:45.428 --> 01:43:47.846
Now you can choose

01:43:47.930 --> 01:43:51.975
That's the measure
of a man

01:43:52.305 --> 01:43:58.188
