all my muscles go?

10:22.120 --> 10:25.120
Neverzone? Time warp?
Things go back to
normal here?

10:25.120 --> 10:27.080
There's nothing left
for me here.

10:32.750 --> 10:34.540
Watching without me?

10:34.540 --> 10:37.960
Got to rip the bandage off
at some point, right?

10:37.960 --> 10:40.290
I'm really sorry for
being a pill earlier.

10:40.290 --> 10:43.210
It's just,
it's gonna be so weird
when you go back to Earth.

10:43.210 --> 10:46.420
Hey, we still have some time
before I need to leave.

10:46.420 --> 10:48.080
Promise you'll visit
all the time.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.960
I will. But, for when
I'm not here...

10:52.750 --> 10:54.540
Just because I'm going
back to Earth

10:54.540 --> 10:57.330
doesn't mean we can't stop
having adventures together.

10:57.330 --> 11:01.830
And I figured,
if there's any lifelong post
to accept on Mewni,

11:01.830 --> 11:03.710
it's our friendship.

11:03.710 --> 11:06.960
Oh, Marco! Thank you.

11:06.960 --> 11:09.420
I love it.
