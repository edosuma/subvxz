00:05.100 --> 00:06.366
The person they're looking for,

00:06.401 --> 00:08.434
the one they think shot
the President... that's me.

00:08.469 --> 00:09.452
<i>Previously on "Scandal"...</i>

00:09.486 --> 00:11.170
- You set me up.
- Yeah, I set you up.

00:11.205 --> 00:12.805
You're mad right now
because I had you.

00:12.840 --> 00:14.407
But, Huck,
you're missing the point.

00:14.441 --> 00:17.610
We're alike. You're like me.
We're built for each other.

00:17.644 --> 00:18.544
What's your real name?

00:18.579 --> 00:19.662
Does it matter?

00:21.248 --> 00:23.432
I will leak to one of
your liberal media papers

00:23.466 --> 00:24.733
that you have terminal cancer.

00:24.751 --> 00:26.135
Step down from the bench, Verna.

00:26.169 --> 00:27.653
I'm asking you nicely.

00:27.688 --> 00:30.256
I could give you my letter
of resignation, or I could

00:30.290 --> 00:31.974
give you the name of the man
who tried to kill the President.

00:31.992 --> 00:33.242
What's the charge?

00:33.260 --> 00:35.094
This man is being held
under the Patriot Act.

00:37.881 --> 00:39.765
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

00:39.799 --> 00:42.318
The American people deserve to
know <i>you,</i> Sally Langston,

00:42.352 --> 00:44.036
caught the President's shooter.

00:44.071 --> 00:46.022
You haven't turned
bashful on old Hollis.

00:46.056 --> 00:48.341
I told the Attorney General
I want to announce it tonight,

00:48.375 --> 00:49.475
in prime time.

00:49.510 --> 00:50.660
So what's the holdup?

00:50.694 --> 00:52.929
They're still interrogating
the suspect.

00:52.963 --> 00:55.414
Suspect. That boy's guilty
as a chicken-feathered hound.

00:55.449 --> 00:57.550
Well, they insist the
evidence is circumstantial,

00:57.601 --> 01:00.253
that we need a confession before
we announce. (Pen clicks)

01:00.287 --> 01:02.238
Are y'all using enhanced
interrogation techniques?

01:02.272 --> 01:03.739
Yes, repeatedly.
He's not cracking.

01:03.773 --> 01:07.276
Maybe they need to <i>enhance</i>
the enhancements.

01:07.311 --> 01:08.544
(Squeaking)

01:08.579 --> 01:12.331
(Huck grunting)

01:12.366 --> 01:14.600
Aah! (Choking)

01:15.886 --> 01:17.870
(Muffled screaming)

01:19.857 --> 01:21.641
What is your name?!
What is your name?! (Coughing)

01:21.675 --> 01:24.043
Who are you working with?!

01:24.077 --> 01:25.661
Aah! Aah!

01:25.696 --> 01:28.431
(Choking)

01:28.465 --> 01:31.133
(Grunts and exhales)

01:31.168 --> 01:33.586
<i>(Huck choking)</i> He hasn't
answered any of our questions yet.

01:33.620 --> 01:35.821
He will.
They always do.

01:35.856 --> 01:37.557
Eventually, they always do.

01:37.591 --> 01:39.575
Uh, I'm just

01:39.609 --> 01:41.043
wondering about...

01:41.077 --> 01:42.495
It really looks like
he can't take

01:42.529 --> 01:44.030
much more of the waterboard...

01:44.064 --> 01:45.981
the interrogating...

01:45.999 --> 01:47.283
and I'm wondering
maybe if we want to do

01:47.317 --> 01:48.634
a little less "interrogating"

01:48.669 --> 01:50.419
and maybe start thinking
about his civil rights.

01:50.453 --> 01:52.538
I'm a U.S. attorney,
gentlemen.

01:52.573 --> 01:54.557
I represent the United
States of America.

01:54.591 --> 01:57.360
The United States of America
is in this room with you,

01:57.394 --> 01:58.761
so you need to watch

01:58.795 --> 02:01.097
how you treat the prisoner
on American soil.

02:02.599 --> 02:04.050
I represent the CIA,

02:04.084 --> 02:05.218
the Department
of Homeland Security,

02:05.252 --> 02:06.552
the Patriot Act,

02:06.587 --> 02:08.204
and all the men and women
who ever fought and died

02:08.238 --> 02:10.455
for your right to stand
in this room with your glasses

02:10.490 --> 02:13.025
and your briefcase
and spout your crap.

02:13.060 --> 02:15.728
We're not on American soil.
This is not America.

02:15.762 --> 02:19.131
This is the Pentagon,
and that is an enemy combatant.

02:19.166 --> 02:20.166
Son, I represent
the United States.

02:20.234 --> 02:21.434
You understand?

02:21.468 --> 02:23.636
The United States of America
is in the room with you.

02:23.687 --> 02:25.354
You're our guest here.

02:25.872 --> 02:27.222
Shut your mouth.

02:28.442 --> 02:30.042
(Buzzer sounds)
Again.

02:30.077 --> 02:31.844

02:38.368 --> 02:40.953
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

02:48.946 --> 02:50.012
Verna.

02:50.047 --> 02:52.014
What are you...
Are you okay?

02:52.048 --> 02:53.633
I'm so sorry, Liv.

02:53.667 --> 02:55.001
It's all my fault.

02:55.085 --> 02:57.236
What's your fault?
What are you...

02:57.271 --> 02:59.438
Huck. I'm the reason
they took Huck away.

03:10.282 --> 03:11.750
Where's Hollis?

03:11.785 --> 03:13.269
Doesn't he usually host this dance?

03:13.303 --> 03:15.604
Hollis Doyle is why I've asked
you all here tonight.

03:15.639 --> 03:17.223
(Indistinct conversations)

03:17.274 --> 03:18.974
Can I, uh, buy you a drink?

03:19.008 --> 03:20.860
Of course you can.

03:20.894 --> 03:22.361
You work so familiar.
You work for Hollis Doyle, right?

03:22.395 --> 03:24.012
I think I've seen you on the Hill.

03:24.030 --> 03:26.115
Oh, Hollis and my daddy
go back a dog's age.

03:26.149 --> 03:29.285
When I left U.T. and told daddy
I wanted to move to Washington,

03:29.319 --> 03:31.186
he said Hollis was
just the man to call.

03:31.204 --> 03:32.488
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

03:32.522 --> 03:34.690
You don't say.

03:34.708 --> 03:37.059
I went to see Hollis
the other day.

03:37.093 --> 03:39.461
Do you know he keeps a
second phone in his office?

03:39.496 --> 03:41.780
Locked it in his desk drawer
the second he laid eyes on me.

03:41.815 --> 03:44.049
It was a cheap little burner
like the drug dealers use.

03:44.084 --> 03:45.501
A phone?

03:45.535 --> 03:47.820
You brought us here because
the man has more than one phone?

03:47.854 --> 03:50.872
My husband is clinging to
life in a hospital bed.

03:50.891 --> 03:53.309
Verna, <i>plenty</i> of people
keep two phones.

03:53.343 --> 03:57.012
In my day, they didn't.

03:57.046 --> 03:58.898
(Projector and camera shutter clicks)

03:58.932 --> 04:03.219
(Clicking)

04:03.253 --> 04:04.520
(Lock clicks)

04:09.993 --> 04:12.894
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

04:15.081 --> 04:16.498
(Clicks)

04:16.533 --> 04:18.951
Well, thank you for keeping us
all updated on Phonegate, Verna,

04:19.002 --> 04:20.902
but I have a husband
waiting for me at home.

04:20.921 --> 04:23.289
I'm sorry.
I guess I'm old-fashioned,

04:23.340 --> 04:27.843
but when Hollis was talking to
that Betsy or... or Becky, maybe,

04:27.877 --> 04:31.079
I could swear he was talking
about the Stanworth Hotel.

04:31.097 --> 04:33.933
Where the sniper
who shot Fitz was.

04:33.967 --> 04:37.886
Well, I was a tri delt,
and she was a chi omega,

04:37.920 --> 04:39.605
so we were just never gonna work
out as roommates, you know?

04:39.639 --> 04:41.357
(Chuckles) I do know.

04:41.391 --> 04:43.592
- You know what the best thing
about my new roommate is? - Mm.

04:43.610 --> 04:45.194
She's out of town.
(Laughs)

04:45.228 --> 04:46.445
You want to get out of here?

04:46.479 --> 04:48.614
Let's, uh, just talk some more.

04:48.648 --> 04:51.933
I really want to get
to know you better.

04:51.952 --> 04:53.535
You know what?
On second thought,

04:53.570 --> 04:56.305
uh, I actually don't want
to get to know you better.

04:56.339 --> 04:58.207
Thanks for the memories.
(Kisses) Enjoy your night.

04:58.241 --> 05:00.576
My sources in the White House

05:00.610 --> 05:03.295
tell me Hollis practically
lives in the Oval

05:03.330 --> 05:04.913
now that Sally Langston's
acting President.

05:04.947 --> 05:07.967
He has done nothing but
benefit from Fitz's absence.

05:08.001 --> 05:09.418
Should we call the number?

05:09.452 --> 05:11.971
No, just hold on to it.
We may need it later.

05:12.005 --> 05:14.890
You all know that ever since
our first meeting,

05:14.924 --> 05:18.060
Hollis Doyle has been out
for nothing but brute power.

05:18.094 --> 05:20.412
He has lied for it.
He's cheated for it.

05:20.447 --> 05:21.814
He's killed for it.

05:21.848 --> 05:23.966
And I've gathered you here
tonight because I believe

05:24.000 --> 05:25.434
he is the one who
tried to assassinate

05:25.468 --> 05:28.304
the President
of the United States.

(Keys jangle)
What did you find out?

06:00.086 --> 06:01.470
Maybe you could say hello
and possibly kiss me

06:01.504 --> 06:02.905
before you start grilling me
for information?

06:02.939 --> 06:04.139
Hello.
Come here.

06:04.174 --> 06:05.658
- What did you find out?
- Nothing.

06:05.692 --> 06:07.259
- Edison.
- Nothing. I found nothing,

06:07.293 --> 06:09.345
and I mean nothing.
Not a whisper.

06:09.379 --> 06:11.163
CIA, NSA, FBI...

06:11.197 --> 06:13.649
No one anywhere is admitting
that they have anyone in custody

06:13.683 --> 06:16.084
in connection with the attempted
assassination of the President,

06:16.102 --> 06:18.787
- which means...
- They definitely disappeared him.

06:18.805 --> 06:20.055
If you would give me
the name of your client,

06:20.073 --> 06:21.357
maybe I could help you
with the...

06:21.391 --> 06:22.557
No.
I told you, no name.

06:22.575 --> 06:24.143
If I had a name, maybe
I could get somewhere.

06:24.177 --> 06:25.594
Sound like I know
what I'm talking about

06:25.612 --> 06:27.529
- when I'm out there fishing for
answers. - I told you,

06:27.564 --> 06:29.748
if we're gonna be together,
we need to have a Chinese wall.

06:29.783 --> 06:31.550
Olivia,
I'm trying to help you.

06:31.601 --> 06:32.701
I know.

06:32.736 --> 06:35.537
And I appreciate it.

06:35.572 --> 06:38.090
Come here.

06:42.712 --> 06:44.930
(Doorbell rings)

06:47.350 --> 06:48.851
(Sighs)
Saved by the bell.

06:55.158 --> 06:57.626
I have an official letter
for Senator Edison Davis.

06:57.644 --> 07:00.295
- You're getting letters
at my house now? - Yes.

07:00.329 --> 07:02.329
I'll need I.D. and thumbprint, sir.

07:03.083 --> 07:04.083
(Beeps)

07:04.117 --> 07:05.484

07:05.518 --> 07:07.536
(Beep)

07:07.570 --> 07:09.304
Sign here.
(Click)

07:09.339 --> 07:10.856
And here.
(Click)

07:10.907 --> 07:13.142
And here.
(Click)

07:14.294 --> 07:15.694
Thank you.

07:20.950 --> 07:22.167
What did you mean?

07:22.202 --> 07:23.435
What?

07:23.470 --> 07:26.021
"Saved by the bell"...
What did you mean by that?

07:26.055 --> 07:27.022
You're avoiding me.

07:27.056 --> 07:28.073
I am not.

07:28.124 --> 07:29.141
We haven't had sex in a week.

07:29.175 --> 07:30.359
The President was shot.

07:30.393 --> 07:32.044
What does that have to
do with our love life?

07:32.078 --> 07:34.480
Fine. You want to have sex?
We can have sex. Let's go.

07:34.514 --> 07:35.898
I don't wanna have sex if
you're gonna have an attitude.

07:35.932 --> 07:37.716
I don't have an attitude.

07:37.751 --> 07:39.318
This is a symptom of whatever
the hell is going on with you,

07:39.352 --> 07:41.887
- just like you and your Chinese wall.
- That is not...

07:41.921 --> 07:43.255
You didn't even tell me
that President Grant was

07:43.339 --> 07:44.790
going to ask to be reinstated.

07:44.824 --> 07:47.826
- What? - I am President pro
tem of the senate, remember?

07:47.861 --> 07:49.762
He's gotta send two letters...
One to me

07:49.796 --> 07:50.829
and one to the speaker of the house.

07:50.864 --> 07:52.397
Ah. Chinese wall.

07:52.432 --> 07:55.200
Fitzgerald Grant
sent you a letter

07:55.235 --> 07:58.070
asking to be reinstated to his
full powers as President?

07:58.104 --> 08:01.256
He's awake and conscious
and he sent you a letter?

08:01.291 --> 08:02.307
And you didn't know?

08:02.342 --> 08:04.292
This is confidential information.

08:04.310 --> 08:05.460
(Chuckles) Edison.

08:05.478 --> 08:06.595
- Where are you going?
- Out.

08:06.629 --> 08:08.564
Olivia, no one can know about this.

08:08.598 --> 08:10.232
President Langston doesn't
even know about this yet.

08:10.266 --> 08:11.433
You cannot tell anyone.

08:11.451 --> 08:12.901
- Move out of my way.
- Liv...

08:12.935 --> 08:15.537
<i>Move out of my way.</i>

08:17.607 --> 08:19.875
Fine.

08:19.909 --> 08:21.610
(Keys jangle)

08:26.916 --> 08:29.802
(Footsteps approach)

08:29.836 --> 08:32.453
(Panting)

08:32.472 --> 08:34.722
I can't believe you didn't
call me the second he woke up.

08:34.756 --> 08:36.341
And don't you dare
use Mellie as an excuse,

08:36.392 --> 08:38.342
because I've seen how fast
you can text on the sly.

08:38.394 --> 08:39.760
My apologies.

08:39.794 --> 08:42.014
No apologies.

08:42.065 --> 08:43.432
He's awake.

08:43.466 --> 08:46.768
(Scanner beeping whirring)
(Exhales deeply)

08:56.913 --> 08:58.247
Tom.
Hal.

09:03.636 --> 09:05.838
(Monitor beeping steadily)
Is he resting?

09:05.872 --> 09:08.006
In a matter of speaking.

09:08.041 --> 09:10.209
Fitz.

09:12.128 --> 09:14.930
Olivia.

09:17.133 --> 09:20.001
He still hasn't woken up.

09:20.019 --> 09:21.670
(Sighs)

09:23.640 --> 09:27.059
What did you do?

09:31.974 --> 09:33.191
Gentlemen, what have we got?

09:33.226 --> 09:34.993
A blockade in the East Sudan straits.

09:35.027 --> 09:37.463
The good news is that President
Grant anticipated this move,

09:37.497 --> 09:38.497
and he put a plan in place

09:38.532 --> 09:40.865
to call an emergency session
of the security council.

09:40.883 --> 09:43.185
The U.N.?
Are we appeasers, gentlemen?

09:43.236 --> 09:44.502
No, ma'am.

09:44.537 --> 09:46.571
Then recommendations
on how we demonstrate that

09:46.606 --> 09:47.939
to the east sudanese.

09:47.974 --> 09:49.224
Two clear options.

09:49.275 --> 09:50.775
(Beep)
We target the blockade directly

09:50.810 --> 09:53.028
using carrier assets in the
Gulf of Aden... (Beep)

09:53.062 --> 09:54.863
Or we strike the headquarters
and military installations

09:54.897 --> 09:57.082
in and around the capital where
kinyazi is based. (Beep)

09:57.116 --> 10:00.468
I propose a third option.
We do both.

10:00.503 --> 10:02.437
(Door opens)

10:02.471 --> 10:03.922
Ma'am?

10:03.956 --> 10:05.809
(Lowered voice) We may have to
hold off on military action.

10:06.960 --> 10:08.894
- Which of you forged
his signature? - I did.

10:08.928 --> 10:09.946
And you didn't try to stop her?

10:09.980 --> 10:11.880
She called me after she
submitted the letter.

10:11.881 --> 10:12.815
Because I knew
he'd try to stop me,

10:12.866 --> 10:14.033
and I didn't want
to be stopped.

10:14.067 --> 10:16.735
- It's not the worst move.
- It is absolutely the worst.

10:16.769 --> 10:18.654
It's a federal crime.
It's treason.

10:18.688 --> 10:19.871
Forging the President's signature

10:19.906 --> 10:21.039
on a letter of reinstatement

10:21.073 --> 10:22.808
when he's not even conscious is...

10:22.842 --> 10:25.043
Do you understand that
we live in a democracy

10:25.077 --> 10:27.646
with laws and rules
and civil discourse?

10:27.664 --> 10:30.882
This is not Nicaragua.
You can't just dic...

10:30.900 --> 10:32.534
- What, steal the White House?
- Yes, we can.

10:32.568 --> 10:34.670
Been done before.
Will be done again.

10:34.704 --> 10:37.489
What are you talking about
is so far outside the law.

10:37.507 --> 10:39.124
I can sign Fitz's signature
in my sleep.

10:39.158 --> 10:41.326
I can do it perfectly. Been
doing it since he was governor.

10:41.360 --> 10:44.696
But I did not sign this paper lightly.

10:44.730 --> 10:46.498
I did not sign this
without using my head.

10:46.532 --> 10:49.601
I'm not some man reacting out
of rage and then thinking later.

10:49.636 --> 10:53.221
I am a woman. So I thought about
it and I made my decision.

10:53.256 --> 10:55.540
Someone shot Fitz
three times,

10:55.574 --> 10:57.092
someone shot Hal,

10:57.126 --> 10:59.177
they <i>killed</i> Britta Kagen,

10:59.212 --> 11:00.696
and Hollis orchestrated it.

11:00.730 --> 11:02.447
And now he's sitting pretty
in the White House

11:02.482 --> 11:04.316
at the right hand of her
majesty Sally Langston,

11:04.350 --> 11:06.151
whispering his dirt
into her ears.

11:06.185 --> 11:08.053
That is not okay.

11:08.087 --> 11:11.840
And because we let
that snake Hollis

11:11.874 --> 11:15.293
play in our garden for so long,
we can't turn him in to the feds

11:15.327 --> 11:17.579
or turn him over to the cops
or to the courts

11:17.613 --> 11:19.631
and wait for justice
to be served,

11:19.666 --> 11:22.034
because we have to protect Fitz.

11:22.068 --> 11:24.119
We have to protect secrets.

11:24.153 --> 11:26.204
We all got in bed
with the devil together

11:26.239 --> 11:27.406
and nobody wants to
go to federal prison,

11:27.440 --> 11:30.142
so I wrote a letter
and I signed it.

11:30.176 --> 11:32.544
I broke the law,
I broke the Constitution,

11:32.578 --> 11:34.279
and I would do it again.

11:34.313 --> 11:35.998
The only way to get rid of Hollis

11:36.049 --> 11:38.700
without committing suicide
is to get Sally out of there,

11:38.735 --> 11:39.918
whatever it takes.

11:39.952 --> 11:41.403
What are the doctors saying?

11:41.437 --> 11:43.071
The bullet in his head
didn't cross the hemisphere.

11:43.122 --> 11:45.741
I know what his injuries are.
What's the prognosis?

11:45.792 --> 11:49.227
That he could wake up in the
next 72 hours and be fine.

11:49.262 --> 11:51.346
Good.
And if he doesn't...

11:51.381 --> 11:54.099
Woodrow Wilson's wife
ran the country for two years

11:54.133 --> 11:55.851
after his stroke,
and no one was the wiser.

11:55.902 --> 11:59.070
- I could run it until he's ready
to take the reins. - Cyrus.

11:59.105 --> 12:02.808
<i>We...</i> could run
the country together.

12:04.727 --> 12:06.128
Liv?

12:06.162 --> 12:07.479
I'm thinking.

12:10.666 --> 12:11.867
Yes, Tom?

12:11.918 --> 12:14.636
I have the sat phone up.
It's President Langston.

12:14.687 --> 12:16.671
She would like to speak
with President Grant.

12:16.706 --> 12:17.739
(Chair scrapes floor)

12:23.563 --> 12:25.747
Thank you.

12:28.434 --> 12:29.935
(Door closes, phone beeps)

12:29.969 --> 12:31.887
Sally, it's like a miracle.

12:31.921 --> 12:33.255
All our prayers,

12:33.289 --> 12:36.541
the prayers you so ably led
the American people in...

12:36.559 --> 12:37.609
They've been answered.

12:37.643 --> 12:39.461
I can't thank you enough.

12:39.495 --> 12:41.329
The lord is good to all.

12:41.364 --> 12:44.382
So, Mellie, I was hoping
to schedule a visit.

12:44.416 --> 12:45.817
A visit?

12:45.851 --> 12:48.570
Yes, to offer your husband
my personal congratulations.

12:48.604 --> 12:50.272
Or we can chat on the
phone if he'd like.

12:50.306 --> 12:51.590
Is he awake right now?

12:51.624 --> 12:53.024
He's sleeping.

12:54.260 --> 12:55.193
Ah.

12:55.211 --> 12:56.595
(Mouths words)

12:56.629 --> 12:58.864
I'm sorry, Sally.
The doctor's asking for me.

12:58.898 --> 13:02.100
I will pass along your
congratulations and best wishes.

13:02.134 --> 13:04.537
Thank you so much for calling.
Bye.

13:05.171 --> 13:07.505
(Phone beeps)

13:07.523 --> 13:08.874
She knows.

13:11.677 --> 13:14.362
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

13:18.951 --> 13:20.652
(Door opens)
David.

13:20.686 --> 13:22.521
- Pat. - Just wanted to see
how things were going.

13:22.555 --> 13:24.489
I can't tell you,
because telling you

13:24.524 --> 13:26.258
would be a violation
of the Patriot Act,

13:26.292 --> 13:28.126
and I could end up in the
basement of the Pentagon

13:28.161 --> 13:31.329
being beaten and waterboarded
to within an inch of my life.

13:31.364 --> 13:32.731
Not that that ever happens.

13:32.765 --> 13:34.916
Yeah.
This is the hard part.

13:34.967 --> 13:36.701
- The hard part?
- Being a U.S. attorney.

13:36.719 --> 13:38.570
Keeping the balance
between upholding the law

13:38.604 --> 13:40.305
and making sure
Americans are safe.

13:40.339 --> 13:41.656
It's a fine line.

13:41.691 --> 13:43.024
But I put you in there
because I thought

13:43.075 --> 13:44.726
you'd be the person
that could walk it.

13:44.760 --> 13:47.996
We're shredding constitutional
amendments like confetti.

13:48.030 --> 13:50.799
No. We're trying to figure out
if some disaffected lunatic

13:50.833 --> 13:53.151
shot the President
of the United States.

13:53.169 --> 13:56.021
Look, no one wants to see you
succeed more than I do,

13:56.055 --> 13:58.590
but you can't just talk about
wearing the white hat.

13:58.624 --> 14:01.026
You can't just fight
the good fight.

14:01.060 --> 14:03.628
We live in the real world.

14:03.663 --> 14:05.580
Remember that.

14:06.649 --> 14:08.700
(Cell phone ringing)

14:08.734 --> 14:11.002
(Beep, door closes)

14:11.037 --> 14:12.888
I haven't found out
anything else.

14:12.939 --> 14:14.072
(James) Nothing?

14:14.106 --> 14:15.724
No. Not about Olivia.
Not about any of them.

14:15.758 --> 14:17.192
What's the problem?
You've had a week.

14:17.226 --> 14:19.411
- I've been busy.
- Too busy for the story of the century?

14:19.445 --> 14:20.795
The President was shot.

14:20.847 --> 14:22.814
There's a lot of stories
of the century this week.

14:22.832 --> 14:24.316
I'm not giving up
on election rigging.

14:24.350 --> 14:26.601
Don't worry.
I'll get to it.

14:26.636 --> 14:28.136
(Beep)

14:28.187 --> 14:30.221
- She thinks this is Becky's number.
- I don't know.

14:30.239 --> 14:32.207
- Should we call it?
- She said not to call it.

14:32.258 --> 14:33.692
But it could lead us to Becky.
It could help Huck.

14:33.726 --> 14:35.460
If Hollis was calling Becky,
that means he was

14:35.494 --> 14:37.212
behind the shooting, and then
tried to frame Huck for it.

14:37.263 --> 14:38.513
So why aren't we going to
the police? Why aren't

14:38.564 --> 14:40.398
- we getting Huck out of jail?
- Huck's not in jail.

14:40.432 --> 14:41.433
They took him
under the Patriot Act.

14:41.467 --> 14:43.768
That's not jail.
That's... that's the dark side.

14:43.802 --> 14:45.120
But still, why aren't we
going to the authorities?

14:45.171 --> 14:47.222
Why aren't we trying?
Why are we just sitting here?

14:47.273 --> 14:48.740
We're not just sitting here.
Liv has a plan.

14:48.774 --> 14:50.692
What plan?
We're out of our depth.

14:50.726 --> 14:52.210
Liv runs with the big dogs.
And, you know,

14:52.228 --> 14:54.613
- I'm starting to think...
- What?

14:54.647 --> 14:56.548
(Sighs) Liv worked
for the White House.

14:56.582 --> 14:58.767
The President was shot.
Huck is in jail for doing it.

14:58.801 --> 15:00.518
One of the richest men in the country...
Hollis Doyle...

15:00.553 --> 15:02.170
might be behind it.

15:02.205 --> 15:04.789
This is next-level stuff.
Grassy knoll stuff.

15:04.824 --> 15:07.325
There's a whole other
layer of D.C., you know,

15:07.359 --> 15:09.527
where real politics happen,
where decisions are made...

15:09.545 --> 15:12.364
Not about democracy
or the flag... about power.

15:12.398 --> 15:13.748
This is about things that
go bump in the night,

15:13.799 --> 15:15.550
stuff regular Americans
never hear about.

15:15.585 --> 15:17.702
This is the real deal.

15:19.138 --> 15:21.223
We don't question Liv on this.

15:24.477 --> 15:26.678
Everyone.

15:26.712 --> 15:28.546
We have a new client.

15:30.716 --> 15:32.216
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

15:36.989 --> 15:38.222
(Clicking)

15:40.801 --> 15:42.886
Do they take me for a fool?
For an absolute child?

15:42.920 --> 15:44.521
What did the First Lady
say when you called?

15:44.555 --> 15:46.256
Oh, I was treated to some sort
of... I don't even know what...

15:46.290 --> 15:48.292
A performance,
amateur theatrics.

15:48.293 --> 15:49.626
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

15:49.727 --> 15:51.861
(Sighs) They could have a
stone-cold corpse over there,

15:51.896 --> 15:53.329
and they'd all be swearing
he's alive and well

15:53.364 --> 15:54.697
and fixing to run
a half-marathon.

15:54.731 --> 15:56.433
Well, I have a duty
to the American people.

15:56.467 --> 15:58.868
A solemn, sworn duty,
by God, you do.

15:58.903 --> 16:00.236
But if I challenge
this reinstatement letter,

16:00.271 --> 16:02.455
I risk seeming like
a power-grabbing opportunist.

16:02.490 --> 16:05.108
In a game of Texas hold'em...

16:05.142 --> 16:07.477
And that's all life
ever really is...

16:07.511 --> 16:09.362
You never want to tip your hand.

16:09.397 --> 16:11.347
So you get someone else
to do your bidding.

16:11.382 --> 16:14.601
If I leak that letter
to the press,

16:14.635 --> 16:17.570
then they'll ask the questions
I can't ask myself.

16:17.621 --> 16:19.672
And you swoop in at the end

16:19.707 --> 16:22.992
and rake up all the chips.

16:23.027 --> 16:26.429
I have in my hands, a copy
of the letter of reinstatement

16:26.463 --> 16:28.848
President Grant signed
just hours ago.

16:28.899 --> 16:30.433
Cable and nets are
wall-to-wall with it.

16:30.451 --> 16:32.585
- Someone leaked the letter.
- Wonder who.

16:32.620 --> 16:33.953
They're gonna want
to see the President.

16:34.004 --> 16:35.638
And by "they," he means
everyone on planet Earth.

16:35.672 --> 16:37.607
Harrison, find a friendly doctor.
Make them a hero.

16:37.625 --> 16:39.626
You want me to lie to the world?

16:39.660 --> 16:41.077
Lie? Hell, no.
That would be in conflict

16:41.111 --> 16:42.512
with both of our ethical standards.

16:42.546 --> 16:44.447
We took oaths, right?

16:44.482 --> 16:46.015
Would you say that
the President's recovery

16:46.050 --> 16:47.383
has been miraculous thus far?

16:47.418 --> 16:49.369
Given the injuries,
it's certainly impressive.

16:49.403 --> 16:50.753
So just short of miraculous?

16:50.788 --> 16:52.755
Quinn, go with him.
We need an anecdote

16:52.790 --> 16:54.691
from a well-placed and
unimpeachable inside source.

16:54.725 --> 16:56.276
I'm a terrible liar.

16:56.327 --> 16:57.694
I'm not your man, ma'am.

16:57.728 --> 16:59.496
No, it's not a lie.
It's just a story.

16:59.530 --> 17:02.549
You've told a tall tale to a
kid before, right, for fun?

17:02.600 --> 17:03.783
No, ma'am.

17:03.818 --> 17:05.601
(Man) ♪ My lady

17:07.288 --> 17:08.938
Cyrus, assure the power players...

The Hill, the cabinet,
senior White House staff.

17:10.491 --> 17:11.974
You need to live this lie.

17:12.009 --> 17:14.644
Act like Fitz' return is
a foregone conclusion.

17:14.678 --> 17:17.196

17:21.285 --> 17:23.653
Well, that depends
on the timing... Cyrus.

17:23.686 --> 17:25.070
Excuse me.
What are you...

17:25.105 --> 17:27.089
Don't mind me. Just grabbing
a few briefing books.

17:27.107 --> 17:29.843
The President is ravenous
for east Sudan intel.

17:29.877 --> 17:31.928
Oh, and take your time
clearing out of here.

17:31.946 --> 17:35.048
The end of the day'll be
just fine. As you were.

17:35.082 --> 17:36.516
♪

17:36.567 --> 17:38.801
The news is encouraging,
but questions are swirling

17:38.819 --> 17:41.037
about the President's
abilities to function,

17:41.071 --> 17:43.106
given the seriousness
of the injuries.

17:43.140 --> 17:45.208
Focus on the positive.
His improvements are miraculous,

17:45.242 --> 17:47.644
and his mobility shows signs
of full recovery.

17:47.678 --> 17:49.312
His movements are involuntary.
He's not even conscious.

17:49.346 --> 17:50.547
(Imitates buzzer)
That's a negative.

17:50.581 --> 17:52.365
Movement at this stage...
Involuntary or not...

17:52.399 --> 17:54.684
shows signs of full recovery, right?

17:54.718 --> 17:56.619
Right, but...

17:56.653 --> 17:58.238
No "but"s. Stay positive. You're
a miracle worker, plain as day.

17:58.272 --> 18:01.808
Don't let anything
get in the way of that. Hmm?

18:01.859 --> 18:03.243
Abby, call Kimberly
Mitchell's producer.

18:03.294 --> 18:05.094
Leak that I just returned from
the hospital, where I visited

18:05.129 --> 18:06.846
with the President. Pretend
you're going behind my back.

18:06.881 --> 18:08.264
Are you sure you wanna lie
to the press?

18:08.298 --> 18:09.966
I know what I'm doing.
Just make the call.

18:09.984 --> 18:12.235
(Clears throat)
Jeff, it's Abby Whelan.

18:12.269 --> 18:13.970
Look, you've got to give me
something.

18:14.004 --> 18:16.823
Anything.
Off the record, at least.

18:16.857 --> 18:19.309
He's in remarkable shape,
but he's not gonna go public

18:19.343 --> 18:20.643
until the wound on his head

18:20.678 --> 18:22.529
is a little more healed,
till the hair grows back.

18:22.563 --> 18:24.781
Is he worried about the
perception with our allies?

18:24.815 --> 18:26.182
- Our enemies?
- Oh. I said enough.

18:26.217 --> 18:27.934
What?

18:27.968 --> 18:29.986
(Sighs)
This stays between us?

18:30.020 --> 18:31.104
Of course.

18:31.155 --> 18:34.090
The First Lady thinks
he's a little vain.

18:34.108 --> 18:35.358
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

18:35.376 --> 18:36.676
Mellie, move back
into the residence.

18:36.710 --> 18:38.011
I'm going to set you
up with one interview.

18:38.045 --> 18:39.429
It's the only one you'll do.

18:39.463 --> 18:41.731
Gesture and smiles only
as you walk out that door.

18:41.765 --> 18:46.202
♪

18:46.236 --> 18:48.171
He is <i>so</i> looking forward to
speaking to the American people

18:48.205 --> 18:50.306
and thanking them
for their devoted support.

18:50.341 --> 18:51.758
He might want to wait till
the scars heal to do that.

18:51.792 --> 18:52.792
Am I right?

18:52.843 --> 18:56.629
(Chuckles) Well, you said
it, not me, but yes.

18:56.680 --> 18:58.581
Between you and me,
he's a little bit vain.

18:58.616 --> 19:00.500
Given the injuries,
I'm a woman of science,

19:00.534 --> 19:02.802
so I don't use words
like "miracle,"

19:02.836 --> 19:04.988
but in my 25 years,
this is as close as I've come.

19:05.022 --> 19:06.706
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

19:06.740 --> 19:08.474
So obviously, we'll continue
to monitor his progress

19:08.509 --> 19:09.892
going forward.

19:09.927 --> 19:11.728
But I'm not funny.
Let the words do the work.

19:11.762 --> 19:13.196
Trying to remain strong...

19:13.230 --> 19:15.798
You know, he told a joke
just after he woke up.

19:15.832 --> 19:18.034
You wanna hear it?

19:18.068 --> 19:19.719
According to this White House
source, soon after waking up,

19:19.753 --> 19:21.337
the President told
the First Lady,

19:21.355 --> 19:23.506
"Next birthday?
Let's order takeout."

19:23.540 --> 19:24.841
And so it's just a matter

19:24.875 --> 19:26.375
of when doctors
release the President.

19:26.393 --> 19:28.144
The dark cloud has lifted
over the country,

19:28.178 --> 19:30.413
as the President is
clearly out of the woods

19:30.447 --> 19:32.715
and ready to take office.

19:32.750 --> 19:35.585
(Monitor beeping steadily)

20:03.764 --> 20:05.748
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

20:05.783 --> 20:08.167
(Water running, shuts off)

20:09.453 --> 20:11.304
(Toothbrush scrubs)

20:12.806 --> 20:15.908
(Sighs deeply)
(Jangles and clatters)

20:15.943 --> 20:17.410
Why aren't you happy?

20:17.461 --> 20:19.362
- What?
- You should be happy.

20:19.396 --> 20:21.197
You thought the President
was dying. Now he's awake,

20:21.231 --> 20:22.765
which is a miracle.

20:22.783 --> 20:24.033
- Yes.
- An actual miracle.

20:24.067 --> 20:25.652
A-call-the-Vatican miracle.

20:25.686 --> 20:27.420
I mean, with that kind of
gunshot wound to the head,

20:27.454 --> 20:29.138
even in the best circumstances...

20:29.173 --> 20:31.908
Well, to be up and talking
and ready to resume office

20:31.942 --> 20:34.761
so soon after that kind
of traumatic brain injury...

20:34.795 --> 20:37.747
No delayed motor skills or aphasia...

20:37.781 --> 20:40.483
(Chuckles) Saints be praised.
Miracle, right?

20:40.517 --> 20:43.319
Aphasia?

20:43.354 --> 20:45.755
That's a word you use
in sentences now?

20:45.789 --> 20:49.442
It is. I quit my job because you
said the baby would be here.

20:49.476 --> 20:51.811
The baby you say exists and is
waiting for us but isn't here...

20:51.845 --> 20:54.030
I told you the baby
has jaundice

20:54.064 --> 20:55.798
and a social worker
is working

20:55.833 --> 20:57.266
to have the paternal rights severed.

20:57.301 --> 20:59.252
The baby isn't here, so I've
got nothing to do all day

20:59.286 --> 21:02.038
but to research gunshot wounds
to the head on the Internet

21:02.072 --> 21:04.607
and call a few of my expert
sources at Johns Hopkins.

21:04.625 --> 21:08.644
The experts, by the way, agree
with the Internet... miracle.

21:10.013 --> 21:12.181
Maybe we shouldn't pick
up the baby at all,

21:12.216 --> 21:13.916
- I mean, if you're too busy.
- Cyrus...

21:13.951 --> 21:15.935
I could call the social worker
and let her know

21:15.969 --> 21:17.754
that you're not ready, what with
your research on miracles

21:17.788 --> 21:19.756
- taking up so much of your time.
- I want the baby.

21:19.790 --> 21:21.724
'Cause you just said
you quit your job,

21:21.759 --> 21:24.894
but I noticed you haven't given
up your White House hard pass.

21:24.928 --> 21:27.764
Also when I called the "Times,"
they said you sill worked there.

21:27.798 --> 21:29.198
They know I'm planning
on quitting,

21:29.233 --> 21:30.784
and I will, just as soon
as we get the baby.

21:30.835 --> 21:31.935
Great.
That's a relief.

21:31.969 --> 21:34.270
Because that little girl isn't
going to raise herself, is she?

21:34.304 --> 21:35.271
No, she is not.

21:35.306 --> 21:37.340
Still, adoptions go wrong
all the time.

21:37.374 --> 21:40.143
Right?
Wouldn't get your hopes up.

21:40.177 --> 21:42.161
(Clatter)

21:42.212 --> 21:45.915
It might take a miracle
to get a baby in your arms.

21:47.718 --> 21:48.684
(Door slams)

21:48.719 --> 21:53.473
(Grunting)

21:53.507 --> 21:54.590
Aah!

21:54.624 --> 21:56.459
(Coughs) Ohh!

21:56.477 --> 21:57.627
(Spits)

21:57.661 --> 22:01.564
(Panting)

22:01.598 --> 22:04.100
You can talk. You can not talk.
It's up to you.

22:04.134 --> 22:05.601
But I gotta tell you something.
If you don't,

22:05.619 --> 22:07.170
you're get the death penalty.
You're gonna fry.

22:07.204 --> 22:08.721
And I'm betting
that President Grant...

22:08.756 --> 22:11.290
he's gonna throw the switch
on you himself.

22:11.325 --> 22:12.658
(Breathing heavily) What?

22:12.693 --> 22:14.710
You're gonna fry at the
hands of President Grant.

22:14.745 --> 22:16.929
- Now... you talk to me...
- I'll...

22:16.964 --> 22:18.347
- Maybe I can get you
a life sentence... - I'll talk.

22:18.382 --> 22:19.565
I'll talk. I'll talk.

22:19.600 --> 22:21.033
Well, there we go.

22:21.084 --> 22:22.852
But not to you.
To them.

22:24.037 --> 22:25.621
<i>I'll talk to you!</i>

22:25.655 --> 22:27.340
<i>I'll tell you everything</i>
<i>you want to know!</i>

22:27.374 --> 22:28.658
Everything you need to know.

22:28.692 --> 22:30.409
But you have to come out
from behind the glass.

22:30.461 --> 22:31.894
Just come out,
and I'll talk to you.

22:31.929 --> 22:35.431
<i>Just come out. I'll talk.</i>

22:35.449 --> 22:37.250
<i>I'll talk. I'll talk.</i>

22:37.301 --> 22:38.851
<i>I'll talk to you.</i>

22:38.902 --> 22:40.153
(Breathing heavily)
(Camera beeps)

22:40.187 --> 22:41.387
Is it on?

22:41.421 --> 22:42.805
(Beeps)
(Panting)

22:46.376 --> 22:47.794
Start talking.

22:47.828 --> 22:49.045
Is the President still alive?

22:49.079 --> 22:50.313
(Man) You can start
with your name.

22:50.347 --> 22:51.264
Is the President still alive?

22:51.298 --> 22:52.865
I'm asking the questions.

22:52.916 --> 22:55.151
I have one question first.
Is he still alive?

22:55.185 --> 22:56.852
- You got one last chance.
- Is he still alive?!

22:56.870 --> 22:58.671
- For crap's sake!
- Yes, he's still alive.

22:58.722 --> 23:00.523
Then he's still in danger.

23:00.557 --> 23:02.942
She's not done.
If he's alive, she's not done.

23:02.976 --> 23:04.560
- Shut it down.
- She's coming back to finish the job.

23:04.594 --> 23:07.113
- Shut it down!
- It's not over. It's not over.

23:07.147 --> 23:09.115
You hear me?
It's not over.

23:09.149 --> 23:10.566
Turn off the camera.
(Huck screaming)

23:10.600 --> 23:11.818
Turn off the camera.

23:11.869 --> 23:14.153
Right now!
Turn off the damn camera!

23:20.127 --> 23:24.230
(Cell phone rings)

23:24.264 --> 23:26.499
(Ring)

23:26.550 --> 23:28.467
(Sighs deeply)

23:28.502 --> 23:29.635
(Ring)

23:29.670 --> 23:31.337
(Click)

23:31.388 --> 23:32.839
(Sets down phone)

23:32.890 --> 23:35.457
(Footsteps approach)

23:38.061 --> 23:39.512
(Door closes)

23:39.563 --> 23:40.897
I know where Huck is.

23:44.551 --> 23:45.518
They're torturing him.

23:45.553 --> 23:46.786
They skipped
the sleep deprivation

23:46.820 --> 23:48.821
and electric shock
elements of the program,

23:48.855 --> 23:51.122
went right to the free skate...
waterboarding.

23:51.157 --> 23:53.558
They've been at it for three
days, but he won't crack.

23:53.592 --> 23:55.060
They can waterboard
him for three months.

23:55.094 --> 23:56.494
He won't crack
because he didn't do it.

23:56.529 --> 23:58.346
- I don't know if he did it or not...
- I'm telling you.

23:58.381 --> 23:59.547
And we know
how good your word is.

23:59.598 --> 24:01.333
Look, the point is,
it's a matter

24:01.367 --> 24:03.886
that needs to be decided in
a court, not a torture chamber.

24:04.720 --> 24:06.237
He did tell them something.

24:06.272 --> 24:08.590
- What? - That the
President's still in danger

24:08.624 --> 24:11.910
and whoever shot him will
be back to finish the job.

24:11.944 --> 24:14.579
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

24:17.500 --> 24:19.534
I need a meeting with Sally.

24:19.568 --> 24:21.519
Do you wanna come talk about
Grant's actual condition?

24:21.553 --> 24:22.987
Because this whole
he's-halfway-to-doing...

24:23.005 --> 24:24.939
push-ups-on the White-House-lawn
bit is wearing awful thin.

24:24.974 --> 24:26.658
The man you're torturing
in the Pentagon

24:26.692 --> 24:28.376
isn't the person who shot
President Grant.

24:28.427 --> 24:30.695
But he knows who did,
and he can help Sally find her.

24:30.730 --> 24:33.431
You mean your employee, who you
were harboring in your office.

24:33.449 --> 24:34.816
We gave you a hell of
a break on that one.

24:34.850 --> 24:36.985
Thank you.
But the fact remains

24:37.019 --> 24:38.770
you have the wrong person in custody,

24:38.804 --> 24:40.205
and he will die at your hands

24:40.239 --> 24:41.990
rather than confess
to a crime he didn't commit.

24:42.024 --> 24:43.725
And you and Sally
can't get the media bump

24:43.759 --> 24:45.176
without the confession, so...

24:45.211 --> 24:47.329
Why on earth
would I release him?

24:47.363 --> 24:49.764
On your say-so?
Because this somehow feeds

24:49.799 --> 24:51.833
the charade that
Fitzgerald Grant is awake?

24:51.867 --> 24:53.668
I wasn't elected yesterday, Olivia.

24:53.719 --> 24:55.603
I know political kabuki
when I see it.

24:55.638 --> 24:57.205
President Grant's life
is still in danger.

24:57.239 --> 24:59.274
- I know it's a leap of faith...
- Leap of faith?

24:59.308 --> 25:00.242
It's swallowing tacks

25:00.276 --> 25:01.976
and expecting
to puke up a unicorn.

25:02.011 --> 25:05.113
These are your experts, Sally.
You called them, not me.

25:05.164 --> 25:06.981
So why don't we listen
to what they have to say?

25:07.016 --> 25:08.316
Gentlemen.

25:08.351 --> 25:10.685
The prisoner was the star
of the B-613 program.

25:10.720 --> 25:12.420
- Which means?
- That the United States government

25:12.455 --> 25:13.855
funneled millions of dollars

25:13.889 --> 25:15.657
into teaching him
how to execute a target

25:15.691 --> 25:16.959
without getting caught.
The prisoner's also

25:16.993 --> 25:18.610
one of the best trackers
the agency has ever seen.

25:18.745 --> 25:20.895
- His dossier, ma'am.
- And you are telling me

25:20.930 --> 25:23.665
that none of the literally
thousands of intelligence agents

25:23.699 --> 25:25.867
I have at my disposal can
do what this man can do?

25:25.918 --> 25:28.020
Read the summary on pages
four and five, ma'am.

25:35.945 --> 25:38.263
(Pages rustle)

25:46.939 --> 25:48.189
(Papers rustle)

25:48.624 --> 25:50.508
How would we go about it?

25:52.211 --> 25:55.013
(Muffled screaming)

25:55.047 --> 25:56.698
(Buzzer sounds, door opens)

25:56.732 --> 25:59.167
<i>(Huck groaning) Ohh!</i>
(Door closes)

25:59.201 --> 26:00.485
Hello, gentlemen.

26:00.519 --> 26:02.037
Where the hell do you
think you're going?

26:02.071 --> 26:03.071
Me?
I'm not going anywhere.

26:03.105 --> 26:04.339
But you all might want
to pack it in,

26:04.373 --> 26:06.441
because, fellas, you're
back on American soil.

26:06.475 --> 26:09.294
<i>(Huck continues groaning)</i>

26:09.328 --> 26:12.013
By executive order,
this man is to be released.

26:12.048 --> 26:13.948
- What? - President Sally
Langston has ordered

26:13.983 --> 26:16.201
that you stop torturing
this United States citizen

26:16.235 --> 26:18.453
and let him go immediately.

26:18.487 --> 26:21.673
(Huck panting)

26:32.384 --> 26:35.120
(Car departs)

26:35.154 --> 26:36.438
We don't have a lot of time.

26:36.472 --> 26:38.089
(Panting)

26:38.124 --> 26:40.491
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

26:40.509 --> 26:41.843
What is this?

26:41.877 --> 26:43.828
A transfer form requesting
the President be moved

26:43.863 --> 26:45.163
to camp David
effective immediately.

26:45.197 --> 26:47.182
- I need you to sign his name.
- Why are we moving him?

26:47.216 --> 26:48.550
You don't need to know <i>why</i>
we are transferring him.

26:48.584 --> 26:50.869
- You just need to sign.
- Several reasons. It's safer,

26:50.903 --> 26:52.854
it's a lot easier to control
the guest list,

26:52.888 --> 26:54.773
and the press has no
access to the place.

26:54.807 --> 26:57.125
It takes him out of the Capitol.
It makes him look weak.

26:57.159 --> 26:59.110
He's unconscious.
He <i>is</i> weak.

26:59.145 --> 27:00.962
(Sighs)

27:00.996 --> 27:02.580
(Pen clicks)

27:04.516 --> 27:05.817
(Scribbling continues)

27:05.835 --> 27:07.685
Thank you.

27:09.638 --> 27:10.722
(Door opens)

27:10.756 --> 27:11.773
How are you holding up?

27:13.526 --> 27:15.093
Me? I'm fine.

27:15.127 --> 27:16.778
(Sighs) It's not easy living a lie,

27:16.812 --> 27:18.546
pretending everything's
perfect when it's not.

27:18.581 --> 27:20.382
I learned that lesson
a while ago.

27:20.416 --> 27:23.367
(Sighs) I keep asking myself,
what am I gonna do?

27:23.386 --> 27:27.555
I mean, I-I can keep the stories
going for so long until...

27:27.590 --> 27:30.825
But if he never wakes...

27:30.860 --> 27:32.527
What am I gonna do?

27:32.561 --> 27:35.463
What are <i>you</i> gonna do?

27:35.498 --> 27:36.915
Do you ever wonder that?

27:36.949 --> 27:38.900
What you're gonna do
without him?

27:38.934 --> 27:41.369
Mellie, you need
to pull it together.

27:41.404 --> 27:43.638
You have one job here...
holding off Sally.

27:43.672 --> 27:46.841
I'm doing everything else,
so get a grip. Okay?

27:51.447 --> 27:52.530
Fine.

27:54.100 --> 27:55.116
(Projector and camera
shutter clicking)

27:55.151 --> 27:56.551
I'm not trying to be
difficult, Senator.

27:56.585 --> 27:57.969
Exactly what is
your role here anyway?

27:58.004 --> 27:59.104
I'm simply telling you
the President

27:59.138 --> 28:00.905
- isn't accepting visitors.
- On whose authority?

28:00.923 --> 28:03.808
- When Olivia gets here...
- You can ask me yourself.

28:03.842 --> 28:05.743
Thank you, Harrison.

28:05.777 --> 28:06.861
I'll be down the hall
if you need me.

28:10.749 --> 28:12.417
- Hello.
- Haven't seen you in two days.

28:12.451 --> 28:14.335
- I've been working.
- You haven't been home in two days.

28:14.370 --> 28:16.404
- I have been working.
- You're not taking any of my calls.

28:16.439 --> 28:17.856
- Again...
- Liv.

28:17.890 --> 28:20.492
Every third time you call,
I answer.

28:20.526 --> 28:22.228
So you have a system
for avoiding my calls?

28:22.261 --> 28:23.161
That's why you're here?

28:23.162 --> 28:25.346
Because I haven't been answering
my phone to your satisfaction?

28:25.381 --> 28:27.215
- I'm here to see the President.
- He's not accepting visitors.

28:27.249 --> 28:29.134
- You're a visitor.
- I'm his...

28:29.168 --> 28:30.301
You're his what?

28:30.336 --> 28:32.504
I'm his friend.

28:33.873 --> 28:35.140
Yeah.

28:35.174 --> 28:36.975
You should go.

28:37.009 --> 28:38.509
I'm not leaving
until I see him.

28:38.527 --> 28:40.128
You're not seeing him.

28:40.162 --> 28:42.230
Okay. You all may have
done a masterful job

28:42.264 --> 28:44.182
with the press
and the American public,

28:44.216 --> 28:46.151
but Sally Langston is whispering
to anyone who will listen

28:46.185 --> 28:48.303
that all is not right
here in Camelot.

28:48.337 --> 28:49.871
Sally has a right
to her opinion,

28:49.905 --> 28:51.439
but I'm not gonna dignify
it with a response.

28:51.474 --> 28:53.374
Olivia, if that letter from
President Grant was forged,

28:53.425 --> 28:54.959
there will be joint
congressional hearings

28:54.994 --> 28:56.528
and letters of impeachment.

28:56.562 --> 28:58.379
The chief justice
of the supreme court

28:58.414 --> 29:00.114
will turn the senate chamber
into a courtroom,

29:00.149 --> 29:02.517
and you will be the star witness
for the prosecution.

29:02.551 --> 29:05.220
Forging that letter or helping
whoever did forge that letter

29:05.254 --> 29:06.604
is staging a coup.

29:06.639 --> 29:08.573
It's an act
of domestic terrorism.

29:08.607 --> 29:11.693
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

29:13.379 --> 29:14.896
I am the leader of the senate.

29:14.930 --> 29:16.748
If my job description requires,

29:16.782 --> 29:18.316
I won't hesitate
to prosecute you

29:18.350 --> 29:19.801
to the full extent of the law.

29:19.835 --> 29:22.203
And guess what.
I make the law.

29:22.238 --> 29:23.571
So you talk it over

29:23.606 --> 29:25.490
with whomever you need
to talk it over with

29:25.524 --> 29:26.824
and then you let me know

29:26.858 --> 29:28.626
when the President is ready to see me.

29:32.298 --> 29:34.332
Good-bye, Edison.

29:46.472 --> 29:48.906
They're moving Fitz
to camp David.

29:48.940 --> 29:51.458
Their mamas didn't raise
no fools. It's a smart play.

29:51.509 --> 29:53.827
Hide him away from media
scrutiny, run out the clock.

29:53.862 --> 29:56.130
Something has got to be done.

29:56.164 --> 29:58.348
This uncertainty is bad
for the country,

29:58.382 --> 29:59.800
bad for the markets,

29:59.834 --> 30:01.735
bad for our image
around the world.

30:01.770 --> 30:03.654
We look weak
to our adversaries,

30:03.688 --> 30:05.556
confused to our friends.

30:06.708 --> 30:08.108
Something's gotta be done.

30:09.811 --> 30:10.961
Hollis?

30:10.995 --> 30:12.696
Plausible deniability,
Madam President.

30:12.731 --> 30:14.081
I'm handling it.

30:14.115 --> 30:16.333
Don't you worry a bit about it.

30:18.987 --> 30:20.354
(Door closes)

30:20.388 --> 30:22.122
<i>The President is in fact</i>
<i>doing well enough</i>

30:22.173 --> 30:25.041
<i>that preparations are underway</i>

30:34.319 --> 30:35.786

30:35.820 --> 30:38.105
(Beep)
Hey.

30:38.139 --> 30:39.990
Yeah,
I'm watching it right now.

30:40.024 --> 30:41.141
<i>(Reporter</i>

30:41.176 --> 30:42.709

I'll be ready.

30:52.069 --> 30:55.005

30:56.741 --> 30:58.809
Wash your hands.
Yeah, I was just...

30:58.843 --> 30:59.976
I-I don't need to be in here
or get in the way.

30:59.994 --> 31:01.044
I only wanted to look at
her through the glass,

31:01.078 --> 31:02.345
and... and she wasn't there.

31:02.363 --> 31:04.782
She's over here in the back,
so you have to come in.

31:04.816 --> 31:06.883
It's great if you come in.

31:06.901 --> 31:09.119
She needs to be held.

31:09.153 --> 31:10.871
She needs to bond with you.

31:10.922 --> 31:12.089
(Fusses)

31:12.123 --> 31:14.057
You know what?
I probably shouldn't.

31:14.092 --> 31:15.092
I mean, all the papers
aren't signed,

31:15.126 --> 31:16.927
and I-I was just stopping by.

31:16.945 --> 31:19.163
You're gonna be her father, right?

31:19.197 --> 31:21.398
Come and meet your daughter.
It's fine.

31:21.432 --> 31:22.616
(Cooing)

31:26.538 --> 31:27.654
Oh.

31:27.689 --> 31:29.506
Would you like to hold her?

31:32.927 --> 31:35.545
H-hi.

31:35.563 --> 31:37.281
(Fusses)

31:37.315 --> 31:39.116
She's clearly very intelligent.

31:39.150 --> 31:40.701
Yes, she is.

31:42.137 --> 31:44.371
(Whispers) Hi. Hi, cutie.

31:44.405 --> 31:46.073
(Baby voice) Hi.
(Speaks indistinctly)

31:46.124 --> 31:48.775
That's right.
That's a good smile.

31:48.810 --> 31:51.328
That's right.
I'm gonna be your daddy.

31:51.362 --> 31:52.613
Yes, I am.

31:52.647 --> 31:56.300
Yes, I am.

31:56.334 --> 31:57.951
Yes, I am.

Thanks.

32:22.443 --> 32:24.260
You might also find this interesting.

32:24.295 --> 32:26.629
- What is this? - The number we pulled
off Hollis Doyle's burner phone.

32:26.647 --> 32:28.348
If it's Becky's,
we'll have our proof

32:28.382 --> 32:29.716
that Hollis is the one
who hired her.

32:29.750 --> 32:30.601
Huck, is there any chance...

32:30.635 --> 32:32.202
No.
Becky's a professional.

32:32.237 --> 32:34.337
If she gets a call from anyone
but Hollis on this number,

32:34.372 --> 32:36.022
she'll spook.

32:36.057 --> 32:37.924
Liv?

32:37.958 --> 32:40.226
I won't let you down this time.

32:40.277 --> 32:41.695
Promise.

34:22.225 --> 34:24.726
They're not moving him to
camp David tonight, are they?

34:24.744 --> 34:26.344
No.

34:26.379 --> 34:28.496
And by the time
I reach for my gun,

34:28.531 --> 34:30.132
you'll have put four bullets in me?

34:30.166 --> 34:31.449
Five.

34:31.484 --> 34:32.735
One for the dog.

34:35.922 --> 34:37.672
Get on your knees!
Show me your hands!

34:37.706 --> 34:39.608
Show me your hands!
Let me see your hands!

34:39.641 --> 34:41.909
(Man) Down on your knees!
(Men shouting indistinctly)

34:41.945 --> 34:45.563
(Man) Put the gun down!

34:46.599 --> 34:48.750
- It's Kate.
- What?

34:48.768 --> 34:50.436
- My real name...
(Man) - All right, move it in.

34:50.469 --> 34:52.204
It's Kate.

Okay.

34:56.275 --> 34:57.559

Take 'em down.

35:04.918 --> 35:06.585
(Man) Clear that weapon.

35:06.619 --> 35:08.454
(Man) In five... four...

35:08.488 --> 35:11.990
Three, two...

35:12.042 --> 35:13.675
My fellow Americans,

35:13.693 --> 35:16.178
for the past week, our nation's
law enforcement agencies

35:16.212 --> 35:19.331
have been working tirelessly
around the clock,

35:19.366 --> 35:20.916
<i>searching for those responsible</i>

35:20.950 --> 35:24.403
<i>for the grave and cowardly</i>
<i>attack on President Grant.</i>

35:24.437 --> 35:26.822
<i>The search is over.</i>

35:26.856 --> 35:29.091
<i>I can report tonight</i>
<i>that we have in custody</i>

35:29.125 --> 35:32.627
<i>the assassin who allegedly</i>
<i>killed Britta Kagen</i>

35:32.645 --> 35:35.714
<i>and shot President Grant</i>
<i>nearly to death.</i>

35:35.749 --> 35:37.783
<i>The justice department</i>
<i>has determined</i>

35:37.817 --> 35:39.785
<i>that the assassin worked alone.</i>

35:39.819 --> 35:41.620
(Knock on door)
Was that a knock?

35:41.654 --> 35:43.355
Someone check on the door.

35:43.390 --> 35:44.673
Got it.

35:44.707 --> 35:46.492
<i>...In your prayers.</i>

35:46.526 --> 35:48.210
<i>I also ask that</i>

35:48.244 --> 35:49.945
<i>while the Attorney General</i>
<i>and her capable team</i>

35:49.979 --> 35:51.447
<i>finalize their investigation,</i>

35:51.481 --> 35:56.185
<i>that we not resort to</i>
<i>baseless speculation or rumor.</i>

35:56.219 --> 35:57.870
<i>In this time of uncertainty,</i>

35:57.904 --> 35:59.588
<i>I can assure you</i>
<i>that our government</i>

35:59.622 --> 36:02.241
<i>is functioning</i>
<i>to its fullest ability.</i>

36:02.292 --> 36:04.693
<i>We have informed our friends</i>
<i>abroad of this situation</i>

36:04.727 --> 36:06.528
<i>and have</i>
<i>their complete support.</i>

36:06.562 --> 36:08.130
We're releasing him
to your custody.

Thank you.

36:59.482 --> 37:02.084
Madam First Lady,
come right in.

37:02.118 --> 37:05.754
Acting President Langston,
thank you for inviting me down.

37:05.788 --> 37:07.589
I see you've been redecorating.

37:07.624 --> 37:09.591
Oh, I just moved in
some family photos

37:09.626 --> 37:12.361
and set aside that dusty
old ship Fitz had on the desk.

37:12.395 --> 37:14.980
Oh, that dusty old ship was
a gift from George Bush Sr.,

37:15.014 --> 37:17.332
but whatever. It'll all
be going back soon enough.

37:17.367 --> 37:18.901
Mm. Some light reading?

37:18.935 --> 37:20.702
It's the east Sudan briefing.

37:20.737 --> 37:22.654
There's only so much "what
to expect when you're expecting"

37:22.705 --> 37:25.340
one can take, and the President
likes me to stay up on things.

37:25.375 --> 37:26.908
Especially now, I'm sure.

37:26.926 --> 37:28.060
How do you mean?

37:28.094 --> 37:30.229
Well, as he recovers
his full capabilities.

37:30.280 --> 37:32.998
(Laughs) Oh. The President
is sharp as a tack.

37:33.032 --> 37:34.633
It really is quite remarkable.

37:34.684 --> 37:36.201
Unbelievable,
one might say.

37:36.236 --> 37:37.803
Modern medicine.

37:37.837 --> 37:40.706
I've just done some
fascinating reading myself.

37:40.740 --> 37:41.690
Mm?

37:41.724 --> 37:43.709
On graphology.
It's...

37:43.743 --> 37:45.143
The study of handwriting.
Yes.

37:45.178 --> 37:47.646
Much of it is rather dry
and somewhat impenetrable,

37:47.697 --> 37:50.899
but other insights are
fairly easy to digest.

37:50.934 --> 37:53.252
For example, the "t"-bar.

37:53.303 --> 37:54.770
I'm not familiar.

37:54.804 --> 37:56.438
Well, it's quite elegant
in its simplicity, really.

37:56.472 --> 37:59.491
You see, when a right-handed
person writes the letter "t,"

37:59.526 --> 38:02.411
they make the cross at the
top go from left to right.

38:02.445 --> 38:05.197
But when a left-handed
person makes the "t"-cross,

38:05.231 --> 38:07.115
it goes from right to left.

38:07.150 --> 38:10.986
Now the President is left-handed,

38:11.004 --> 38:13.555
but his First Lady is not.

38:13.590 --> 38:16.174
(Paper rustles)

38:16.226 --> 38:19.211
Fitzgerald Thomas Grant.

38:19.245 --> 38:21.897
Three "t's" in all,
as it happens,

38:21.931 --> 38:24.082
(chuckles)

38:24.117 --> 38:25.234
There's an old saying...

38:25.268 --> 38:27.636
An expert is someone
who's read one book.

38:27.670 --> 38:28.637
I'm quite sure I could find

38:28.671 --> 38:30.606
an actually accredited
graphologist

38:30.640 --> 38:32.024
who will swear that Fitz
signed that piece of paper,

38:32.058 --> 38:33.642
particularly given that
he's still recovering

38:33.676 --> 38:35.010
his full motor skills

38:35.044 --> 38:37.179
resulting from a gunshot
wound to the head.

38:37.213 --> 38:38.864
And will you also find a doctor?

38:38.898 --> 38:41.300
Because I have a sworn affidavit

38:41.334 --> 38:42.884
from one of President
Grant's physicians

38:42.918 --> 38:45.454
at James Madison hospital
saying that your husband

38:45.488 --> 38:49.007
has failed to so much
as open his eyes.

38:49.042 --> 38:51.159
Madam First Lady,
you will withdraw

38:51.194 --> 38:53.178
this letter of reinstatement,
or I will have no choice

38:53.212 --> 38:56.214
but to reveal it for
the humiliating forgery it is.

39:06.643 --> 39:08.043
Cyrus?

39:08.077 --> 39:10.912
There's no miracle.

39:10.947 --> 39:12.347
What?

39:12.382 --> 39:14.099
Fitz...

39:14.133 --> 39:16.101
He's not awake.
He's not talking.

39:16.135 --> 39:18.537
He's not anything.
There's no miracle. We lied.

39:18.571 --> 39:20.889
Report it. Don't report it.

39:20.923 --> 39:22.774
I don't care anymore.
It doesn't matter.

39:27.413 --> 39:29.781
I just called my boss and quit.

39:29.816 --> 39:31.500
I'm not a reporter anymore.

39:31.534 --> 39:34.586
I'm not chief of staff anymore.

39:37.273 --> 39:38.540
(Sighs)

39:38.574 --> 39:40.792
Let's go get our baby.

39:42.362 --> 39:43.378
Let's.

39:43.413 --> 39:44.796
Okay.
