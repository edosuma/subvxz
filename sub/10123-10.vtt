WEBVTT

00:01.400 --> 00:03.400
"AND IT WAS ALWAYS
SAID OF SCROOGE

00:03.400 --> 00:06.367
"THAT HE KNEW HOW TO
KEEP CHRISTMAS WELL,

00:06.367 --> 00:08.800
"IF ANY MAN ALIVE
POSSESSED THE KNOWLEDGE.

00:08.800 --> 00:13.767
"MAY THAT BE TRULY SAID
OF US, AND ALL OF US.

00:13.767 --> 00:15.200
"AND SO
AS TINY TIM OBSERVED,

00:15.200 --> 00:19.033
<i>GOD BLESS US, </i>
<i>EVERY ONE." </i>

00:19.033 --> 00:21.233
AND SO ENDS
DICKENS' MASTERPIECE,

00:21.233 --> 00:22.967
<i>A CHRISTMAS CAROL. </i>

00:22.967 --> 00:24.100
WAIT A MINUTE.

00:24.100 --> 00:25.300
THAT'S NOT THE END.
WHERE'S THE GRINCH?

00:25.300 --> 00:28.000
YEAH. ISN'T THE GRINCH
SUPPOSED TO SHOW UP NOW

00:28.000 --> 00:30.200
AND, LIKE,
TAKE EVERYTHING?

00:30.200 --> 00:33.934
HOW COME IT'S CALLED
<i>A CHRISTMAS CAROL, </i>ANYWAY?

00:33.934 --> 00:37.233
YEAH. THERE WAS NOBODY
IN THIS STORY NAMED CAROL.

00:38.300 --> 00:39.567
MISS LAWRENCE,
WOULD YOU PLEASE

00:39.567 --> 00:41.767
TRADE PLACES
WITH MR. MATTHEWS?

00:41.767 --> 00:43.300
ALL RIGHT.

00:44.367 --> 00:45.400
I AM A HYPERACTIVE,

00:45.400 --> 00:48.967
UNDERACHIEVING,
11-YEAR-OLD BOY.

00:50.100 --> 00:51.667
I MEANT PHYSICALLY.

00:51.667 --> 00:55.400
OH, WELL, THAT TAKES
LESS OF A PSYCHIC TOLL.

00:55.400 --> 00:56.400
WHY DO I HAVE TO MOVE?

00:56.400 --> 00:58.500
WE WERE JUST GIVING
OUR VIEW OF THE BOOK.

00:58.500 --> 01:01.000
YEAH. I MEAN, YOU SAY
LITERARY MASTERPIECE,

01:01.000 --> 01:02.767
WE SAY...ANH!
ANH!

01:02.767 --> 01:06.300
MR. MATTHEWS, I'M LESS
INTERESTED IN YOUR REVIEW

01:06.300 --> 01:08.367
THAN I AM THAT YOU
UNDERSTAND THE MATERIAL.

01:08.367 --> 01:10.800
WHAT, IN YOUR OPINION,
WAS MR. DICKENS

01:10.800 --> 01:13.734
TRYING TO EXPRESS
IN HIS CHRISTMAS STORY?

01:13.734 --> 01:15.233
THAT IF YOU'RE
A REAL BUTTHEAD,

01:15.233 --> 01:17.300
THEN NEAT GHOSTS WILL
TAKE YOU TO COOL PLACES.

01:20.200 --> 01:22.500
ANH!

02:24.967 --> 02:26.100
FISH AND STICKS.

02:26.100 --> 02:29.100
TWO THINGS NATURE NEVER
WOULD'VE PUT TOGETHER.

02:29.100 --> 02:30.567
WHAT'D YOU GET?

02:30.567 --> 02:31.867
PEANUT BUTTER AND JELLY.

02:31.867 --> 02:34.300
TWO THINGS NATURE
COULDN'T KEEP APART.

02:34.300 --> 02:37.000
SINCE WHEN DID YOUR MOM
PACK YOU LUNCH?

02:37.000 --> 02:38.667
I THOUGHT YOU LIKED
FISH STICKS.

02:38.667 --> 02:41.100
I DO, BUT I THINK
IT'S CRUEL

02:41.100 --> 02:42.500
HOW THE LITTLE FISH
SCREAM

02:42.500 --> 02:46.367
WHEN THEY RIP
THEIR STICKS OFF.

02:46.367 --> 02:47.934
MAY I SIT DOWN?

02:47.934 --> 02:49.033
NO.
NO.

02:49.033 --> 02:52.233
WELL, SINCE
YOU'RE AMBIVALENT.

02:52.233 --> 02:53.567
AH, CHRISTMAS.

02:53.567 --> 02:54.600
SEASON
OF TOGETHERNESS.

02:54.600 --> 02:56.367
SEASON
OF BROTHERHOOD.

02:56.367 --> 02:57.400
SEASON OF WOOL.

02:57.400 --> 03:00.100
9 OUT OF 10
CHRISTMAS GIFTS--WOOL.

03:00.100 --> 03:01.600
IT DOESN'T MATTER
IF IT'S SHAPED

03:01.600 --> 03:02.700
LIKE SOCKS
OR A SWEATER,

03:02.700 --> 03:04.300
IT'S WOOL
AND IT'S ITCHY.

03:04.300 --> 03:07.600
THE GIFT ISN'T AS IMPORTANT
AS THE THOUGHT BEHIND IT.

03:07.600 --> 03:09.233
WHAT'S THE THOUGHT
BEHIND WOOL?

03:09.233 --> 03:11.734
THIS KID DOESN'T
SCRATCH ENOUGH?

03:12.800 --> 03:14.000
I AGREE WITH STUART.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.800
OH, NO.
IT'S A NERD SWARM.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.667
MINKUS, SHUT OFF
YOUR GEEK MAGNET.

03:18.667 --> 03:20.300
I JUST THINK
WE OFTEN LOSE SIGHT

03:20.300 --> 03:22.000
OF THE TRUE MEANING
OF CHRISTMAS

03:22.000 --> 03:24.100
IN THE FRENZY
OF COMMERCIALISM.

03:24.100 --> 03:25.400
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

03:25.400 --> 03:27.000
HOW ARE WE GONNA
KNOW WHAT TO ASK FOR

03:27.000 --> 03:28.467
IF WE DON'T HAVE
COMMERCIALS?

03:28.467 --> 03:31.700
CHRISTMAS IS THE CELEBRATION
OF THE WINTER SOLSTICE,

03:31.700 --> 03:36.000
AN ANCIENT TRIBAL RITUAL
WHOSE ORIGINS ARE LOST IN TIME.

03:36.000 --> 03:38.467
YEAH, WE WERE JUST
TALKING ABOUT THAT

03:38.467 --> 03:39.867
IN THE BATHROOM.

03:39.867 --> 03:42.467
LISTEN, TOPANGA,
I THINK I CAN HEAR THEM

03:42.467 --> 03:45.133
CALLING YOU BACK INTO
YOUR OWN DIMENSION.

03:45.133 --> 03:46.133
OH, YEAH. THEY'RE SAYING,

03:46.133 --> 03:49.200
"TOPANGA,
GET YOUR AURA BACK HERE"

03:49.200 --> 03:52.500
"AND BRING MINKUS."

03:55.767 --> 03:56.767
HA!
HA!

03:56.767 --> 03:59.100
OK. CHRISTMAS TREE UPDATE.

03:59.100 --> 04:03.000
I THINK I GOT MY REAL LEATHER
NBA REGULATION BASKETBALL.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.667
COOL. MAJOR GIFT.

04:04.667 --> 04:05.767
SO MAJOR A GIFT,

04:05.767 --> 04:08.567
I'VE BEEN SAVING UP
TO BUY MY GIFT A GIFT.

04:08.567 --> 04:09.567
WHAT DO YOU GET

04:09.567 --> 04:11.100
THE BASKETBALL
WHO HAS EVERYTHING?

04:11.100 --> 04:16.834
A $5.00 TOP OF THE LINE
IMITATION NYLON NET.

04:16.834 --> 04:17.967
YOU HAVE 5 BUCKS?

04:17.967 --> 04:20.500
I'VE BEEN SAVING UP
FOR A MONTH.

04:20.500 --> 04:22.400
LET'S GO BUY IT
AFTER SCHOOL.

04:22.400 --> 04:24.233
NO. YOU SEE, THEN
I TIP OFF MY PARENTS

04:24.233 --> 04:25.500
THAT I KNOW WHAT
I'M GETTING.

04:25.500 --> 04:27.934
YOU ARE
A YULETIDE MASTER.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.100
CHRISTMAS IS VERY DELICATE.

04:30.100 --> 04:32.400
YOU SCREW UP--WOOL.

04:33.467 --> 04:35.767
SO, WHAT'S THE UPDATE
AT YOUR HOUSE?

04:35.767 --> 04:38.500
ME? HEY, BOB STUBCHECK'S
SPORTS WORLD

04:38.500 --> 04:39.500
HAS TO SEND OVER
A TRUCK

04:39.500 --> 04:41.300
WITH ALL THE STUFF
MY DAD GOT ME.

04:41.300 --> 04:43.500
HE GOT ME,
LIKE, EVERYTHING.

04:43.500 --> 04:44.567
THAT'S GREAT.

04:44.567 --> 04:47.033
YEAH. MY DAD TOTALLY
CAME THROUGH THIS YEAR.

04:47.033 --> 04:49.033
SPEAKING OF GIFTS,
I BELIEVE

04:49.033 --> 04:50.400
YOU HAVEN'T YET
CHIPPED IN YOUR $5.00

04:50.400 --> 04:52.500
FOR THE CLASS PRESENT
TO MR. FEENY.

04:52.500 --> 04:53.567
TOMORROW.

04:53.567 --> 04:54.667
YOU SAID THAT
YESTERDAY.

04:54.667 --> 04:55.900
COME ON, SHAWN,

04:55.900 --> 04:58.133
DON'T THINK OF IT AS
$5.00 FOR FEENY'S PRESENT.

04:58.133 --> 05:01.033
THINK OF IT AS 5 BUCKS
TO MAKE MINKUS GO AWAY.

05:01.033 --> 05:04.500
LOOK, MINKUS, I JUST SPENT
MY LAST MONEY ON LUNCH, OK?

05:04.500 --> 05:06.934
I'LL GIVE IT TO YOU
TOMORROW.

05:09.800 --> 05:13.900
WHAT? HIS MOTHER CHARGED
HIM A PACKING FEE?

05:19.233 --> 05:21.200
[SIGHS]

05:30.734 --> 05:31.734
HI.

05:31.734 --> 05:33.834
HEY! DID YOU HAVE
FUN AT THE MALL?

05:33.834 --> 05:35.867
I DON'T THINK
I'D CALL IT FUN.

05:35.867 --> 05:39.467
WELL, HI, PUMPKIN.
I BET YOU HAD FUN.

05:39.467 --> 05:43.400
DID YOU GET YOUR PICTURE
TAKEN WITH SANTA CLAUS?

05:43.400 --> 05:48.200
AAAH!

05:48.200 --> 05:50.033
I TRIED TO TELL YOU.

05:50.033 --> 05:52.100
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT...

05:52.100 --> 05:53.600
MEANT
"DON'T MENTION SANTA."

05:53.600 --> 05:54.967
WHAT HAPPENED?

05:54.967 --> 05:57.767
WELL, MORGAN WAS WAITING
IN LINE TO SIT ON SANTA'S LAP,

05:57.767 --> 06:00.967
AND SHE WAS KIND OF NERVOUS,
AND THERE WAS THIS ELF

06:00.967 --> 06:03.834
WHO LOOKED LIKE
A HITMAN, ONLY MEANER.

06:03.834 --> 06:05.100
WHAT?
DID SANTA SCARE HER?

06:05.100 --> 06:07.600
NO, NO. HE WAS JUST
THIS NICE OLD MAN

06:07.600 --> 06:08.800
WITH A JOLLY RED FACE.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.767
YOU KNOW, LOOKING BACK,
HIS FACE REALLY WAS TOO RED.

06:11.767 --> 06:13.900
I MEAN I JUST THOUGHT
HE WAS OVERHEATED.

06:13.900 --> 06:16.200
VELVET IS A FABRIC
THAT DOESN'T BREATHE.

06:16.200 --> 06:17.367
AMY, WHAT HAPPENED?

06:17.367 --> 06:20.600
WELL, OK, SO MORGAN
CLIMBS UP ON SANTA'S LAP,

06:20.600 --> 06:21.834
AND HE ASKS HER
WHAT SHE WANTS,

06:21.834 --> 06:23.400
AND SHE SAYS
A SUZIE HOMEMAKER OVEN,

06:23.400 --> 06:25.967
AND THEN HE GRABBED
HIS CHEST,

06:25.967 --> 06:29.967
YELLED "RUDOLPH,"
AND FELL OVER.

06:33.767 --> 06:37.400
ARE WE TALKING 8 REINDEER
PULLING A PINE BOX?

06:37.400 --> 06:39.300
NO, NO. I THINK
HE'S ALL RIGHT.

06:39.300 --> 06:41.767
I MEAN, THE HITMAN ELF
GAVE HIM CPR

06:41.767 --> 06:44.667
WHILE MRS. CLAUS
CALLED THE PARAMEDICS.

06:44.667 --> 06:46.867
ALAN, IT ISN'T FUNNY!

06:46.867 --> 06:50.400
MORGAN THINKS
SHE KILLED SANTA CLAUS.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.667
WELL, DID YOU TELL HER
THAT HE'S OK?

06:53.667 --> 06:56.300
OF COURSE I DID. I SAID
HE WAS JUST RESTING

06:56.300 --> 06:57.600
AND HE'D BE FINE.

06:57.600 --> 07:00.066
WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN TAKE HER
TO VISIT HIM IN THE HOSPITAL.

07:00.066 --> 07:01.600
I REALLY DON'T THINK
IT'LL HELP HER TO SEE

07:01.600 --> 07:05.100
SANTA CLAUS WITH A TUBE
STUCK UP HIS NOSE.

07:05.100 --> 07:06.367
HEY. WHAT'S
WITH THE WEASEL?

07:06.367 --> 07:07.567
SHE LOCKED HERSELF
IN THE BATHROOM

07:07.567 --> 07:08.700
AND SHE'S SINGING...

07:08.700 --> 07:10.600
<i>♪ ON THE FIRST DAY </i>
<i>OF CHRISTMAS ♪ </i>

07:10.600 --> 07:13.800
<i>♪ I MURDERED </i>
<i>SANTA CLAUS ♪ </i>

07:13.800 --> 07:17.700
I'LL GO CHECK ON HER.
OHH!

07:19.400 --> 07:21.133
HI, CORY.

07:22.467 --> 07:25.000
HELLO, SON,
APPLE OF MY EYE.

07:25.000 --> 07:29.400
DAD, THERE'S NO REACHING HIM
WHEN HE'S TAKING INVENTORY.

07:30.500 --> 07:32.500
YES! A NEW ARRIVAL!

07:32.500 --> 07:34.600
IT'S WOOL.

07:35.734 --> 07:37.000
YOU KNOW, COR,
WHEN I WAS A KID,

07:37.000 --> 07:39.300
CHRISTMAS WAS ABOUT
APPRECIATING YOUR GIFTS

07:39.300 --> 07:41.300
BECAUSE THEY WERE
GIVEN WITH LOVE.

07:41.300 --> 07:44.300
LOVE, RIGHT.
GLAD THAT'S OVER.

07:44.300 --> 07:48.200
OK. 3 NEW BOXES AND
ONLY ONE SOUNDS ITCHY.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.300
I'M GOING TO
GO TELL SHAWN.

07:49.300 --> 07:51.300
WHOA. WAIT A MINUTE.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

07:51.300 --> 07:52.500
TO CALL SHAWN.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.200
I DON'T THINK IT'D BE
SUCH A GOOD IDEA

07:54.200 --> 07:56.233
TO EXAGGERATE ABOUT
THE GIFTS YOU'RE GETTING.

07:56.233 --> 07:57.600
I HAVE TO
JUST TO KEEP UP.

07:57.600 --> 07:58.700
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

07:58.700 --> 08:00.100
I MEAN,
BOB STUBCHECK'S

08:00.100 --> 08:01.400
SPORTS WORLD
HAS BEEN MOVED.

08:01.400 --> 08:03.600
IT'S NEW LOCATION?
UNDER SHAWN'S TREE.

08:03.600 --> 08:06.200
YOU KNOW, I THINK
SHAWN MAY HAVE BEEN

08:06.200 --> 08:07.667
EXAGGERATING
A LITTLE BIT.

08:07.667 --> 08:08.967
DAD, IT'S CHRISTMAS.

08:08.967 --> 08:10.600
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO EXAGGERATE.

08:10.600 --> 08:11.600
I'M GONNA TELL HIM

08:11.600 --> 08:13.600
I GOT 5 NEW PRESENTS
UNDER THE TREE.

08:13.600 --> 08:14.900
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T THINK

08:14.900 --> 08:17.400
SHAWN'S GONNA BE HAVING MUCH
OF A CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR.

08:17.400 --> 08:18.500
WHY NOT?

08:18.500 --> 08:23.300
[SIGHS] SHAWN'S DAD
GOT LAID OFF.

08:23.300 --> 08:25.300
SHAWN'S DAD
LOST HIS JOB?

08:25.300 --> 08:28.900
YEAH. I GUESS HE WAS JUST
TOO EMBARRASSED TO TELL YOU.

08:28.900 --> 08:31.867
BUT I'M HIS BEST FRIEND.

08:31.867 --> 08:35.100
SO THAT'S WHY HIS MOM'S
PACKING HIS LUNCH.

08:35.100 --> 08:37.500
SHAWN'S NOT GETTING
ANYTHING FOR CHRISTMAS,

08:37.500 --> 08:41.400
JUST LIKE TINY TIM
IN THAT STORY ABOUT CAROL.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.800
I DON'T THINK
IT'S QUITE THAT BAD.

08:43.800 --> 08:46.200
DAD, CAN I GIVE HIM
ONE OF THE PRESENTS

08:46.200 --> 08:48.200
UNDER THE TREE SO
AT LEAST HE HAS SOMETHING?

08:48.200 --> 08:50.100
HEY, THAT'D BE
REALLY NICE, COR.

08:50.100 --> 08:54.300
OK. HOW ABOUT ONE
OF ERIC'S?

08:55.600 --> 08:58.200
<i>Morgan: ♪ WE WISH YOU </i>
<i>A MERRY CHRISTMAS ♪ </i>

08:58.200 --> 09:01.500

09:15.400 --> 09:16.600
<i>NO, HE'S NOT. </i>

09:16.600 --> 09:19.934
WELL, THEN HOW COME HE JUST
CALLED ME ON THE PHONE?

09:19.934 --> 09:21.800
<i>HE DID? </i>

09:21.800 --> 09:22.800
YEP.

09:22.800 --> 09:24.000
<i>WHAT DID HE SAY? </i>

09:24.000 --> 09:27.600
HE SAID, "HO HO H--
OHH! OHH!"

09:27.600 --> 09:29.500
STOP IT.

09:32.467 --> 09:34.000
WHAT?

09:35.367 --> 09:38.200
HE SAID YOU'VE BEEN
A VERY, VERY GOOD GIRL

09:38.200 --> 09:41.200
AND I SHOULD GIVE YOU
SOMETHING REALLY SPECIAL.

09:41.200 --> 09:42.300

09:42.300 --> 09:43.967
WHATEVER YOU TELL HER,
SHE'S GONNA WANT IT

09:43.967 --> 09:47.100
THE SECOND
YOU OPEN THAT DOOR.

09:47.100 --> 09:52.100
HOW ABOUT MY NEW FLANNEL SHIRT
THAT YOU LIKE SO MUCH?

09:57.767 --> 09:59.900
OK.

10:03.600 --> 10:04.900
TA-DA!

10:04.900 --> 10:06.200
WHAT?

10:06.200 --> 10:07.600
FOR YOU.

10:07.600 --> 10:08.600
WHAT IS IT?

10:08.600 --> 10:10.600
OPEN IT.
FOR YOU FROM ME.

10:10.600 --> 10:12.700
IT'S NOT GOING
TO BLOW UP, IS IT?

10:12.700 --> 10:14.734
OPEN IT! OPEN IT!

10:14.734 --> 10:17.467
HERE.
LET ME OPEN IT.

10:22.500 --> 10:25.500
A REAL LEATHER
NBA CERTIFIED,

10:25.500 --> 10:27.900
