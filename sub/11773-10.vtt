THE STUPID CALL
FROM THE PLANE--
I DIDN'T--

01:10.333 --> 01:11.900
YOU WERE BUSY

01:11.933 --> 01:15.100
BUSY WITH THE TiVo GUY.
YEAH, I WAS BUSY WITH
THE TIVO GUY.

01:15.133 --> 01:17.167
Leon:
YOUR BRAIN IS ALL FUCKING
DISCOMBOBULATED, MAN.

01:17.200 --> 01:18.667
YOU NEED TO FOCUS
ON SOME ASS.

01:18.700 --> 01:20.700
I'M JUST NEVER GONNA MEET
ANYBODY LIKE HER AGAIN,

01:20.733 --> 01:22.367
EVER EVER.

01:22.400 --> 01:25.167
I'M NOT DISPUTING THAT,
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO MEET
SOMEBODY ELSE.

01:25.200 --> 01:27.900
- YOU'VE GOT TO MOVE ON.
- THERE'S NOBODY THAT
COMPARES TO HER.

01:27.933 --> 01:29.800
I CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE
BEING WITH ANYBODY ELSE.

01:29.833 --> 01:32.133
LISTEN, MAN, YOU'VE GOT
TO GET OUT THERE
AND DO STUFF.

01:32.167 --> 01:34.400
GET DOWN THERE
AND GET BREAKFAST.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:34.433 --> 01:36.900
IS SHE GOING

01:36.933 --> 01:38.400
YEAH, SHE'S COMING

01:38.433 --> 01:40.433
SHE'S BRINGING

01:42.267 --> 01:45.367
WHAT DO YOU
WANT ME TO DO?
WE DIDN'T PICK SIDES.

01:45.400 --> 01:47.767
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'VE GOT TO SEE HER
WITH THIS GUY

01:47.800 --> 01:49.900
- AT SAMMIE'S BAT MITZVAH.
- WELL, WHO ARE YOU
GONNA BRING?

01:49.933 --> 01:51.733

01:51.767 --> 01:54.167
BRING SOMEBODY?
WHO AM I GONNA BRING?

01:54.200 --> 01:56.633
YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIND HER

01:56.667 --> 01:58.367
YEAH, YOU GOTTA
FIND SOMEBODY, MAN.

01:58.400 --> 02:00.733
- I'M NOT A GOOD DATER.
I CAN'T DATE.
- WHY CAN'T YOU DATE?

02:00.767 --> 02:03.300
YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE
IN YOUR LARRY SHELL
RIGHT NOW.

02:03.333 --> 02:05.567
YOU'VE GOT TO BECOME
ANOTHER MOTHERFUCKER
RIGHT NOW.

02:05.600 --> 02:07.733
LARRY,
GROW A MUSTACHE, MAN.
GROW A GOATEE,

02:07.767 --> 02:10.400
A MUSTACHE,
GROW SIDEBURNS. BECOME
ANOTHER MOTHERFUCKER, MAN.

02:10.433 --> 02:12.800
- YOU FEEL ME?
- IT'S NOT BAD ADVICE.

02:12.833 --> 02:15.900
IT'S NOT BAD ADVICE.
BUT ANYTHING TO GET
YOUR ASS OUT OF BED.

02:15.933 --> 02:17.900
GET YOUR ASS OUT OF--
WH--?

02:17.933 --> 02:19.433

02:19.467 --> 02:21.333
YOU'VE GOT BEDBUGS?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

02:21.367 --> 02:23.500
OH, NOTHING.

YOU KNOW, WE HAVE
PRIVACY HERE.

04:25.767 --> 04:27.600
I KNOW.
LARRY, THERE'S NOTHING
I CAN DO.

04:27.633 --> 04:29.733
WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE
CONTROL OF THE THERMOSTAT.

04:29.767 --> 04:31.733
- THAT'S RIGHT,

04:31.767 --> 04:33.200
WHY DON'T WE

04:33.233 --> 04:35.667
I'M NOT GONNA
PAY FOR AN OFFICE
I'M NOT USING.

04:35.700 --> 04:38.167
WELL,
SOMEBODY'S GONNA TAKE IT
IF YOU DON'T TAKE IT.

04:38.200 --> 04:40.600
HOW DO YOU STOP SOMEBODY
FROM RENTING IT?

04:40.633 --> 04:42.700
THAT'S WHAT
I WANT TO KNOW.

04:42.733 --> 04:45.567
HOW ARE YOU?

I JUST HATE IT.

04:54.500 --> 04:56.800
- I KNOW, LARRY.
I'M SORRY.

04:56.833 --> 05:00.200
I SWEAR TO GOD,
I CAN GET MARRIED AGAIN
IN A MONTH IF I COULD.

05:00.233 --> 05:03.733
OH, LARRY.
LARRY DAVID,
YOU ARE A ROMANTIC.

05:03.767 --> 05:05.667

05:05.700 --> 05:07.900
OH, I FORGOT.
MATT TESSLER CALLED
AND SAID,

05:07.933 --> 05:09.867

05:09.900 --> 05:12.267
- HE'S IN THE BUILDING?

05:12.300 --> 05:14.233
HE SAID HE KNOWS YOU,

05:14.267 --> 05:16.533
YEAH, HE DIRECTED
FOUR "SEINFELDS."

05:16.567 --> 05:18.433
HE WAS TERRIBLE, THOUGH.
HE WAS A TERRIBLE DIRECTOR.

05:18.467 --> 05:20.267
- OH, I REMEMBER MATT.
- WHAT DOES HE WANT?

05:20.300 --> 05:23.567
LEWIS IS DOING A PILOT NOW,
AND I'LL BET HE WANTS ME
TO RECOMMEND HIM.

05:23.600 --> 05:26.600

M.S. OR M.D. OR...?

05:29.833 --> 05:32.100
I DON'T KNOW.
THERE'S SOMETHING.

05:32.133 --> 05:33.733
I COULD SAY
THAT YOU HAD TO LEAVE,

05:33.767 --> 05:35.733

06:11.700 --> 06:15.333
- IS THERE ANY WAY YOU CAN
JUST GIVE HIM A--?
- I'M REALLY NOT...

06:15.367 --> 06:17.533
- YOU'RE NOT TIGHT ANYMORE?
- NOT REALLY TIGHT.

06:17.567 --> 06:19.800
'CAUSE THEY'RE
FLOATING MY NAME
TO DIRECT HIS PILOT

06:19.833 --> 06:21.400

06:21.433 --> 06:23.667
WELL, IF I RUN INTO HIM,

06:23.700 --> 06:26.400
YEAH, IF I HAD
A RECOMMENDATION
FROM YOU, THOUGH,

06:26.433 --> 06:28.400
THAT WOULD MEAN
THAT I'D HAVE A SHOT

06:28.433 --> 06:31.467
THE SITCOM-- YOU KNOW,
I'D COME IN AT 9:00-10:00,

HEY, LARRY, DO YOU STILL

07:47.067 --> 07:48.867
- --NOT JUST 'CAUSE--
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

07:48.900 --> 07:50.567
- AND YOU.
- I'M GONNA CALL RICHIE
RIGHT NOW.

07:50.600 --> 07:52.300
- THANKS, ANT--
- ANTOINETTE.

07:52.333 --> 07:53.933
- YEAH.
- I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THAT.

07:53.967 --> 07:56.733
- OKAY, THANK YOU, LARRY.
THANKS SO MUCH.
- OKAY.

08:00.833 --> 08:02.800
Hi, it's Richard.
Leave a message.

08:02.833 --> 08:04.867
- ( machine beeps )
- HEY, RICHARD, IT'S LARRY.

08:04.900 --> 08:06.867
MATT TESSLER
JUST ASKED ME

08:06.900 --> 08:08.767
TO RECOMMEND HIM
FOR YOUR PILOT...

08:08.800 --> 08:11.167
( slowly )
...SO THIS IS ME CALLING

08:11.200 --> 08:13.433
TO RECOMMEND--

08:13.467 --> 08:15.500
"RECOMMEND" HIM.

08:15.533 --> 08:18.333
SO IN CASE
HE EVER ASKS YOU

08:18.367 --> 08:21.633
IF I RECOMMENDED HIM,
YOU CAN TELL HIM

08:21.667 --> 08:23.967
THAT IN FACT I DID

08:24.067 --> 08:27.067
RECOMMEND HIM.

08:27.067 --> 08:28.933
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

08:32.267 --> 08:34.233
- HI.
- HI.

08:34.267 --> 08:36.533
JUST SIGN IN, PLEASE,
AND HAVE A SEAT.

08:36.567 --> 08:38.200
SHOULDN'T BE TOO LONG.

08:38.233 --> 08:40.667
I HAVE A LITTLE PROBLEM
WITH THIS--

08:40.700 --> 08:44.333
( chuckles )
THESE SIGN-IN SHEETS,
YOU KNOW.

08:44.367 --> 08:46.867
MY NAME'S RIGHT
OUT IN THE OPEN HERE.

08:46.900 --> 08:50.067
IT'S A BIT
OF A PRIVACY ISSUE.

08:50.100 --> 08:52.767
THERE'S NO SHAME
IN HAVING TO COME

08:52.800 --> 08:54.600
TO THE GASTROENTEROLOGIST'S
OFFICE.

08:54.633 --> 08:56.500
IT'S A LITTLE EMBARRASSING
MAYBE, YOU KNOW.

08:56.533 --> 08:58.733
WE COULD JUST PUT
A SIGN UP ON THE WALL
SAYING,

08:58.767 --> 09:01.867
"LARRY DAVID WAS HERE."
WHY DON'T WE DO THAT?

09:01.900 --> 09:03.533
YOU KNOW,
I HAVE TO TELL YOU

09:03.567 --> 09:04.967
I'VE WORKED HERE
FOR FOUR YEARS

09:05.067 --> 09:06.700
AND I'VE NEVER HAD
ANYONE COME IN

09:06.733 --> 09:09.267
AND, LIKE, CRUISE THE LIST
OF PATIENT NAMES

09:09.300 --> 09:10.900
FOR ANY REASON.

09:10.933 --> 09:14.233
WHAT IF YOU ARE
IN CHARGE OF THIS, OKAY,

09:14.267 --> 09:15.967
SO THIS IS DOWN HERE?
YOU KEEP THAT.

09:16.067 --> 09:17.633
I DON'T LIKE THAT.
FIRST OF ALL,

09:17.667 --> 09:19.400
I ONLY GET PAID
$9 AN HOUR,

09:19.433 --> 09:21.633
SO IT'S A LITTLE
MORE RESPONSIBILITY
THAN I'M USED TO,

09:21.667 --> 09:23.100
TO KEEP TRACK
OF PATIENTS.

09:23.133 --> 09:25.300
SECOND OF ALL,
I CAN'T EVEN MAKE
DECISIONS.

09:25.333 --> 09:26.900
YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT UP
WITH THE HOME OFFICE.

09:26.933 --> 09:29.133
I WOULD LIKE
TO TAKE IT UP
WITH THE HOME OFFICE.

09:29.167 --> 09:32.100
- SEE, YOU DIDN'T THINK I WAS
GONNA TAKE YOU UP ON THAT.
- NO, I DID THINK YOU WERE.

09:32.133 --> 09:35.100
- YOU STRIKE ME AS A HIGH--
- WELL, THINGS LIKE THIS
INTEREST ME.

09:35.133 --> 09:38.533
I'M NOT AN INVENTOR,
BUT I'M AN IMPROVER.

09:38.567 --> 09:40.467
I IMPROVE THINGS
THAT ARE BROKEN.

09:40.500 --> 09:42.133
THIS IS BROKEN.
THIS SYSTEM IS BROKEN.

09:42.167 --> 09:43.800
I'D LIKE TO IMPROVE IT.

09:43.833 --> 09:46.500
GREAT.
I'M ASSUMING YOU'RE
A NEW PATIENT,

09:46.533 --> 09:48.233
'CAUSE I THINK I WOULD
HAVE REMEMBERED YOU.

09:48.267 --> 09:50.500
- SO PLEASE
FILL THAT OUT.
- OKAY.

09:54.267 --> 09:57.067
( chuckles )
WHAT WOULD YOU DO
IF I SAT THERE, HUH?

09:57.067 --> 10:00.067
YOU'D BE A LITTLE
FREAKED OUT IF I SAT THERE,
WOULDN'T YOU, HONESTLY?

10:00.100 --> 10:03.067
- A LITTLE BIT.
A LITTLE BIT.
- I THINK A LOT.

10:03.100 --> 10:05.100
YEAH, THAT'S
A LITTLE CREEPY.
( chuckles )

10:05.133 --> 10:06.333
WHAT ARE YOU READING?

10:06.367 --> 10:08.667
IT IS CALLED
"SHOWBIZ INSIDER."

10:08.700 --> 10:11.367
- REALLY?
- I LIKE TO FEEL
LIKE AN INSIDER WHEN--

10:11.400 --> 10:14.567
- PRETTY HEADY STUFF. WOW.
- YES, VERY HEADY STUFF.

10:14.600 --> 10:16.733
MANY ARE CALLED.
FEW ARE CHOSEN.

10:16.767 --> 10:19.167
YOU MUST BE
VERY VERY BRIGHT.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.333
YES.

10:21.367 --> 10:23.533
WHERE ARE YOU FROM,
NEW YORK?

10:23.567 --> 10:25.533
- I'M PICKING UP
AN ACCENT.
- YEAH.

10:25.567 --> 10:27.767
YEAH.
YOU FROM NEW YORK?

10:27.800 --> 10:29.200
YEAH.

10:30.900 --> 10:33.000
BUT I'M NOT A JEW,
IF THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING.

10:33.033 --> 10:36.567
- ( laughs )
- 'CAUSE I SAW
YOUR WHEELS SPINNING.

10:36.600 --> 10:40.367
THAT'S UNCANNY.
IT'S LIKE THERE'S
A WINDOW INTO MY SOUL

10:40.400 --> 10:41.933
AND YOU CAN JUST
REALLY READ ME.

10:41.967 --> 10:43.733
I READ YOU
LOUD AND CLEAR, SISTER.

10:43.767 --> 10:46.233
- YES.
- YEAH.

10:46.267 --> 10:47.900
ARE YOU OKAY, BY THE WAY?
DO YOU HAVE ANY--

10:47.933 --> 10:50.733
YOU HAVE SOME
TERRIBLE MEDICAL PROBLEM
THAT BROUGHT YOU HERE?

10:50.767 --> 10:53.167
I'M FINE.
A CHECKUP.

10:53.200 --> 10:56.100
- A CHECKUP?
- MMM.

10:56.133 --> 10:58.533
HMM, REALLY?

10:58.567 --> 11:00.300
YOU?

11:00.333 --> 11:01.933
- A CHECKUP.
- REALLY?

11:01.967 --> 11:04.200
- YEAH.
- HUH.

11:04.233 --> 11:06.633
- HOW ABOUT THAT?
- LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION:

11:06.667 --> 11:08.567
DID YOU EVER GO OUT
WITH A BALD GUY?

11:08.600 --> 11:10.800
( laughs )
YEAH.

11:10.833 --> 11:12.300
HOW DID YOU FIND IT?

11:12.333 --> 11:13.967
IT WAS MAGICAL.

11:14.067 --> 11:16.067
- YEAH? SEE?
- YES.

11:16.100 --> 11:19.233
HOW AM I DOING
ON THE FLIRT SO FAR?

11:19.267 --> 11:21.233
- HOW WOULD YOU
ASSESS IT?
- UM...

11:21.267 --> 11:23.767
- PRETTY GOOD?
- I'M-- WELL, 7.5.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.600
- 7.5? REALLY?
- 7.5, YEAH.

11:25.633 --> 11:28.100
- YOU'RE TOUGH.
- LARRY DAVID?

11:28.133 --> 11:29.500
- YOU'RE UP.
- ALL RIGHT.

11:29.533 --> 11:31.733
WELL, THEY HAVE
CALLED FOR ME.

11:31.767 --> 11:33.200
LARRY?

11:33.233 --> 11:36.400
I GUESS I'LL GO IN
FOR MY CHECKUP.

11:37.500 --> 11:40.067
- A CHECKUP.
- NICE TALKING TO YOU.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.633
GOOD LUCK.

11:43.267 --> 11:44.833
SO LONG.

11:47.067 --> 11:49.067
HELLO, MR. DAVID.
HOW ARE YOU?

11:49.067 --> 11:51.267
- GOOD.
- GOOD. ALL RIGHT.

11:51.300 --> 11:53.867
OH, YOU KNOW MY COUSIN,
MATT TESSLER.

11:53.900 --> 11:55.400
OH, MATT'S YOUR COUSIN?
OH, YEAH.

11:55.433 --> 11:57.333
OH, RIGHT.
OH, THANK YOU FOR THIS...

11:57.367 --> 11:58.900
YEAH, SURE SURE SURE.

11:58.933 --> 12:01.067
SO LET ME ASK YOU,
MR. DAVID,

12:01.100 --> 12:02.900
WHY ARE YOU HERE
TO SEE THE DOCTOR?

12:02.933 --> 12:05.533
UM...

12:05.567 --> 12:07.933
I'D JUST AS SOON
TELL THE DOCTOR.

12:07.967 --> 12:10.467
IT'S OKAY.
I'VE GOT TO TAKE ALL
OF THE INFORMATION FIRST

12:10.500 --> 12:13.133
AND I GIVE IT TO THE DOCTOR.
SO WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
THE REASON YOU'RE HERE?

12:13.167 --> 12:15.100
I KNOW,
BUT IF THE DOCTOR'S
GONNA COME IN HERE,

12:15.133 --> 12:17.200
WHY NOT JUST
TELL THE DOCTOR?
I DON'T SEE WHY

12:17.233 --> 12:19.600
I NEED TO TELL YOU AND--
THEN YOU HAVE TO TELL
THE DOCTOR.

12:19.633 --> 12:22.100
- WELL...
- WHY NOT JUST
TELL HIM DIRECTLY?

12:22.133 --> 12:24.167
I'M GOING TO NEW YORK.
WHY AM I STOPPING OFF
IN FLORIDA?

12:24.200 --> 12:26.933
MM-HMM. OUR POLICY IS
THAT I TAKE THE INFORMATION
DOWN FIRST

12:26.967 --> 12:29.367
AND I GIVE IT TO HIM.
HE'LL COME IN AND
GO OVER THIS.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.167
SO HE'LL HAVE IT ALL
WRITTEN DOWN.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.900
HE WON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH
ALL OF THE QUESTIONS AGAIN.

12:32.933 --> 12:35.133
- THIS WHOLE THING IS ASKEW,
YOUR SYSTEM.
- MM-HMM.

12:35.167 --> 12:37.533
THE DOCTOR SHOULD
BE IN HERE RIGHT NOW.
WE COULD BE SAVING TIME.

12:37.567 --> 12:39.267
HE'S GOT OTHER PATIENTS
THAT HE'S DEALING WITH,

12:39.300 --> 12:42.200
SO WHAT I'M HERE--
I PRETTY MUCH CUT THE TIME
IN HALF WITH HIM.

12:42.233 --> 12:44.567
CUT THE TIME IN HALF?
SO YOU INTERCEPT HIM
IN THE HALL?

12:44.600 --> 12:46.400
HE'S GONNA
GET THE INFORMATION
AND THEN WHAT,

12:46.433 --> 12:48.500
RUN TO THE INTERNET
TO LOOK IT UP? NO.

12:48.533 --> 12:51.400
- HE'S GONNA HEAR IT FROM YOU.
- THE DOCTORS AND THE NURSES
WORK HAND IN HAND.

12:51.433 --> 12:53.667
I JUST NEED THE INFORMATION.
IF YOU COULD JUST
GIVE IT TO ME--

12:53.700 --> 12:55.933
I'M NOT THAT COMFORTABLE
TELLING YOU, FRANKLY.

12:55.967 --> 12:57.733
I NEED TO TAKE IT DOWN
BEFORE I CAN LEAVE.

12:57.767 --> 13:01.433
OKAY, I HAVE A GERBIL
UP MY ASS.

13:01.467 --> 13:04.467
THAT'S MY PROBLEM.

13:06.967 --> 13:09.700
HOW LONG
HAS IT BEEN THERE?

13:09.733 --> 13:12.833
TWO DAYS.

13:14.633 --> 13:16.700
OKAY, THANK YOU.
THE DOCTOR WILL BE
RIGHT WITH YOU.

13:16.733 --> 13:18.767
FINE.
HAPPY?

13:21.800 --> 13:23.600
- Man: MR. DAVID.
- HELLO, DOCTOR.

13:23.633 --> 13:25.600
- LARRY, NICE TO SEE YOU.
- OKAY.

13:25.633 --> 13:27.600
I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU COULD TELL ME

13:27.633 --> 13:30.167
WHAT SEEMS TO BE
THE PROBLEM.

13:44.267 --> 13:46.467
HEY, WHAT HAPPENED--

13:46.500 --> 13:48.400
WHAT HAPPENED
TO THE SIGN-IN SHEET?

13:48.433 --> 13:50.733
OH, I CALLED OUR
CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS

13:50.767 --> 13:52.567
OFF YOUR SUGGESTION
AND THEY LOVED IT.

13:52.600 --> 13:55.133
- SO THERE'S A NEW POLICY.
- WHAT?

13:55.167 --> 13:57.100
IT'S PRIVATE,
JUST LIKE YOU WANTED.

13:57.133 --> 13:59.200
NO NO NO,
I DON'T WANT THAT.

13:59.233 --> 14:02.700
YOU'RE LISTENING TO ME?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M
TALKING ABOUT.

14:02.733 --> 14:04.733
PUT THE SIGN-IN SHEET
BACK ON.

14:04.767 --> 14:06.933
- I CAN'T. NO.
- WHAT?

14:06.967 --> 14:08.500
YOU CAN'T SEE THIS NOW.

14:11.367 --> 14:13.533
FIRST OF ALL, I'VE GOT
TO TELL YOU SOMETHING,

14:13.567 --> 14:15.533
- OKAY?
- YES.

14:15.567 --> 14:17.533
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE

14:17.567 --> 14:19.767
FOR THE WAY
I BEHAVED EARLIER.

14:19.800 --> 14:21.767
MR. DAVID,

14:21.800 --> 14:24.167
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
PLAY GAMES WITH ME.

14:24.200 --> 14:25.733
- I DON'T?
- NO.

14:25.767 --> 14:28.500
ARE YOU LOOKING
FOR CHRISTOPHER?

14:28.533 --> 14:30.200
NO.

14:30.233 --> 14:32.767
- ANDREW?
- KEEP GOING.

14:32.800 --> 14:33.933
PAULA?

14:33.967 --> 14:35.633
AHA.

14:35.667 --> 14:38.267
- YOU CANNOT TELL.
I COULD GET FIRED.
- NO NO NO, NEVER.

14:38.300 --> 14:40.767
- NO NO NO NO.
- I HAVE NO FORMAL
EDUCATION.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.867
- NO NO NO NO NO.
- OKAY.

14:42.900 --> 14:45.367
BE CAREFUL.

14:45.400 --> 14:47.467
- THANK YOU.
- SHE LOOKS LIKE
A LIVE WIRE.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.767
- Jeff: YOU CALLED HER?
- Larry: YEAH.

14:51.800 --> 14:54.233
SO WHERE ARE YOU GOING
TO TAKE HER ON A DATE?

14:54.267 --> 14:55.767
I'M GONNA TAKE HER
TO THE MOVIES MAYBE.

14:55.800 --> 14:57.767
THAT'S GREAT.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.733
THE QUESTION IS,
WHY WAS SHE AT THAT--

14:59.767 --> 15:01.833
WHAT KIND OF DOCTOR
WAS THAT AGAIN?

15:01.867 --> 15:03.967
- MM, GASTROENTEROLOGIST.
- SO WHAT WAS SHE
DOING THERE?

15:04.067 --> 15:05.433
- THAT'S THE QUESTION.
- OH MY GOD.

15:05.467 --> 15:07.067
WHY WAS SHE THERE?
I DON'T KNOW.

15:07.100 --> 15:09.067
I HOPE SHE DOESN'T HAVE
THE SAME THING I DO.

15:09.100 --> 15:11.100
WELL, THAT'S A GOOD THING.
IT'LL GO AWAY.

15:11.133 --> 15:12.667
YEAH.

15:12.700 --> 15:14.200
LET ME ASK YOU
A QUESTION:

15:14.233 --> 15:16.767
HOW MUCH WILL YOU GIVE ME
TO START GARGLING NOW?

15:16.800 --> 15:18.933
- 50 BUCKS.
- YOU'LL GIVE ME
50 BUCKS?

15:18.967 --> 15:20.600
- 50 BUCKS.
- TAKE IT OUT
OF YOUR POCKET.

15:20.633 --> 15:22.700
MM-HMM.
MMM.

15:22.733 --> 15:25.067
JUST DO IT.
WHAT, YOU DON'T TRUST ME?

15:25.100 --> 15:27.300
( gargles )

15:27.333 --> 15:30.200
( laughs )
THERE YOU GO.

15:31.767 --> 15:33.800
- I JUST GOT 50 BUCKS.
- NO, NOW THAT DOESN'T COUNT.

15:33.833 --> 15:35.833
- NO, YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
- NO, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

15:35.867 --> 15:38.300
I WOULD HAVE
PAID THAT HAPPILY.
IT WAS SO ENJOYABLE.

15:38.333 --> 15:42.067
IT WAS SO ENJOYABLE
AND YOU RUINED IT WITH
"I JUST GOT 50 BUCKS."

15:42.100 --> 15:44.700
LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION:
TESSLER'S STILL ONE
OF YOUR CLIENTS?

15:44.733 --> 15:47.067
YEAH.
HE'S COMING
TO THE BAT MITZVAH.

15:47.100 --> 15:48.867
YOU KNOW
WHO ELSE IS COMING
TO THE BAT MITZVAH?

15:48.900 --> 15:50.500
MY NEWEST CLIENT
JOHN LEGEND.

15:50.533 --> 15:53.300
HE'S A HUGE R&B SINGER.

15:53.333 --> 15:54.833
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHO THIS GUY IS.

15:54.867 --> 15:56.833
- DO YOU KNOW
WHO ANYONE IS?
- NO.

15:56.867 --> 16:00.367
- WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME
YOU BOUGHT AN ALBUM?
- 1972?

16:00.400 --> 16:02.933
- '72? SO YOU KNOW NO ONE.
- NO, I KNOW NOTHING.

16:02.967 --> 16:05.333
ANYHOW,
HE'S MY CLIENT NOW.
HE'S COMING

16:05.367 --> 16:07.733
TO THE BAT MITZVAH.
HE'S GONNA SING.

16:07.767 --> 16:10.067
WELL, MAYBE I'LL BRING
THIS WOMAN.

16:10.100 --> 16:12.733
YOU KNOW, IF WE
GET ALONG TONIGHT,
I'M GONNA ASK HER.

16:12.767 --> 16:15.133
'CAUSE YOU GOTTA BRING
SOMEBODY. CHERYL'S COMING
WITH THAT GUY.

16:15.167 --> 16:16.967
- YOU GOTTA BE THERE
WITH SOMEBODY.
- ABSOLUTELY.

16:17.067 --> 16:18.967
WHY DON'T WE
DOUBLE-DATE TONIGHT?

16:19.067 --> 16:21.167
YOU KNOW WHAT?
SUSIE AND I WERE TALKING
ABOUT GOING TO THE MOVIES.

16:21.200 --> 16:22.433
YOU'RE KIDDING.
LET'S DO IT.

16:22.467 --> 16:23.833
PERFECT.
I CAN CHECK HER OUT.

16:28.867 --> 16:30.867
Larry:
I HAVEN'T DATED IN A WHILE.
WHO PAYS?

16:30.900 --> 16:33.667
- YOU PAY.
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
YOU PAY.

16:33.700 --> 16:35.467
- I DO?
- Women: YES, YOU PAY.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.767
- LARRY'S NOT USED TO DATING.
- CLEARLY, YES.

16:37.800 --> 16:40.233
- NO, I HAVEN'T DATED
IN A LONG TIME.
- NO, A LONG TIME.

16:40.267 --> 16:43.833
WHAT DO I DO?
AM I ALLOWED TO HOLD HANDS
DURING THE MO--?

16:43.867 --> 16:46.167
- Susie: I DON'T KNOW
IF THERE'S RULES--
- IS THERE A RULE?

16:46.200 --> 16:49.867
EXCUSE ME.

16:49.900 --> 16:51.867
THANK YOU.

16:51.900 --> 16:54.067
HI.

16:54.100 --> 16:58.300
ONE MOVIE.

16:58.333 --> 17:00.433
THANK YOU.

17:04.667 --> 17:07.233
- Larry: DON'T YOU WANT
TO SIT ON THE AISLE?
- Women: NO.

17:07.267 --> 17:09.567
- I WAS BEING NICE.
- Women: CENTER'S BETTER.

17:09.600 --> 17:11.933
CENTER? WHY?
YOU THINK THERE'S
A BIG DIFFERENCE

17:11.967 --> 17:13.600
- OVER THERE FROM HERE?
- YES, THIS IS GOOD.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.733
Jeff:
AS LONG AS A GIANT MAN
DOESN'T SIT

17:15.767 --> 17:17.967
- IN FRONT OF ME.
- Susie: OR A GIANT WOMAN.

17:19.067 --> 17:20.833
- Larry: OH MY GOD.
- Paula: WHAT?

17:20.867 --> 17:22.833
THIS GUY.
THAT'S THE GUY

17:22.867 --> 17:25.167
WHO WALKED PAST THE LINE
TO GET HIS TICKET BEFORE.

17:25.200 --> 17:27.067
- Paula: OH, YEAH.
- PETE!

17:27.067 --> 17:28.533
- LOOK AT HIM.
- I THINK IT IS.

17:28.567 --> 17:30.667
OH MY GOD.
HE WAS FAKING.

17:30.700 --> 17:32.167
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
- NO.

17:32.200 --> 17:34.133
THAT'S REALLY GOOD.

17:34.167 --> 17:36.067
- OH MY GOD.
- HOLY SHIT.

17:36.067 --> 17:37.933
I GOTTA
TAKE MY HAT OFF TO HIM.

17:37.967 --> 17:40.433
I GOTTA TELL YA,
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

17:40.467 --> 17:42.667
( dramatic music playing )

18:01.733 --> 18:02.900
ARE YOU OKAY?

18:02.933 --> 18:04.800
YEAH, I'M FINE.

18:04.833 --> 18:06.733
( whispering )
WHY? WHY ARE YOU
ASKING ME THAT?

18:06.767 --> 18:08.800
( whispering )
NO REASON.

18:14.533 --> 18:16.500
EVERYTHING OKAY
WITH YOU?

18:16.533 --> 18:18.500
YEAH, I'M FINE.

18:18.533 --> 18:19.700
ARE YOU SURE?

18:19.733 --> 18:21.933
YEAH.
WHY SHOULDN'T IT BE?

18:21.967 --> 18:23.933
IT'S JUST YOU'RE
SQUIRMING A LOT.

18:23.967 --> 18:25.333
YOU'RE SQUIRMING
MORE THAN I AM.

18:25.367 --> 18:26.700
WELL, MY SEAT
IS UNCOMFORTABLE.

18:26.733 --> 18:28.400
YEAH, MY SEAT'S
UNCOMFORTABLE TOO.

18:28.433 --> 18:30.833
I KNOW.
WE'RE IN AGREEMENT.

18:30.867 --> 18:32.767
WHY DID YOU SAY
YOU WENT

18:32.800 --> 18:34.567
TO THAT
GASTROENTEROLOGIST'S
AGAIN?

18:34.600 --> 18:36.400
- I WAS THERE
FOR A CHECKUP.
- A CHECKUP?

18:36.433 --> 18:38.567
- YES. WHY DO YOU
KEEP ASKING ME THAT?
- I'VE NEVER HEARD

18:38.600 --> 18:41.067
OF ANYBODY GOING TO
A GASTROENTEROLOGIST
FOR A CHECKUP.

18:41.067 --> 18:43.067
- OH, REALLY?
- YEAH.

18:43.067 --> 18:45.067
THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE
DOING THERE.

18:45.067 --> 18:47.367
- IS THAT WHAT I SAID?
- YES, THAT'S WHAT
YOU SAID.

18:50.667 --> 18:53.567
HONESTLY, I'M JUST
REALLY KIND OF BORED
WITH THIS MOVIE.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.700
IT'S NOT SO BAD.

18:56.733 --> 18:59.467
I REALLY WANT TO GO.
CAN WE GO?

18:59.500 --> 19:01.267
PLEASE.

19:01.300 --> 19:03.267
ARE YOU GONNA
DRAG ME OUT OF THIS MOVIE

19:03.300 --> 19:05.067
WITH FIVE MINUTES TO GO?
THAT'S INSANE.

19:05.067 --> 19:08.467
IT'S NOT FIVE MINUTES.
THIS IS THE WORLD'S
WORST FILM

19:08.500 --> 19:10.600
I'VE EVER SEEN
AND I REALLY WANT TO GO.

19:10.633 --> 19:12.433
COME ON,
FIVE MORE MINUTES.

19:12.467 --> 19:15.600
WHAT DO YOU GAIN BY STAYING?
YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT
THIS STORY.

19:15.633 --> 19:17.133
I FINISH
THINGS I START.

19:17.167 --> 19:18.700
BOOKS--
THEY COULD BE
500 PAGES,

19:18.733 --> 19:20.767
ONCE I START THEM,
EVEN IF I HATE IT,
I'LL FINISH IT.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.767
I HAVE FRIENDS
WHO I CAN'T STAND,

19:22.800 --> 19:25.733
YOU KNOW,
FOR, LIKE, 25 YEARS.

19:25.767 --> 19:27.733
I'M STILL FRIENDS
WITH THEM.

19:27.767 --> 19:29.533
WHY?

19:29.567 --> 19:32.100
BECAUSE I
STAY TO THE END,
TILL THEY'RE DEAD.

19:32.133 --> 19:34.400
I GO DOWN
WITH THE SHIP.
THAT'S WHAT I DO.

19:34.433 --> 19:36.367
I'M NOT EVEN THE CAPTAIN,
I'M GOING DOWN
WITH THE SHIP.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.233
THAT'S HOW I WANT YOU
TO THINK ABOUT ME:

19:38.267 --> 19:40.267
I'M THE GUY WHO KEEPS
THE CAPTAIN COMPANY.

19:43.300 --> 19:45.600
I CAN'T WATCH THIS.

19:47.500 --> 19:50.567
EXCUSE ME.
I'M SORRY.

19:50.600 --> 19:52.633
- WHERE IS SHE GOING?
- I DON'T--

19:54.333 --> 19:57.067
- SHE WAS BORED.
- IT'S ALMOST OVER.

19:57.067 --> 19:58.533
I KNOW.
I TOLD HER.

19:58.567 --> 20:00.200
IT'S FIVE MINUTES TO GO.
IT'S CRAZY.

20:00.233 --> 20:01.900
YOU'D BETTER
GO OUT AFTER HER.

20:01.933 --> 20:04.033
- SHE'S NOT GONNA
WAIT FOR YOU.
- YOU DON'T EXPECT

20:04.067 --> 20:06.333
SOMEBODY ELSE TO LEAVE
IF YOU'RE WALKING OUT
OF THE MOVIE.

20:06.367 --> 20:09.467
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WOMEN.
- YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
ETIQUETTE.

20:09.500 --> 20:11.533
Susie: FINE.

20:26.533 --> 20:29.133
- WHERE IS SHE?
- SHE'S NOT HERE.

20:29.167 --> 20:31.267
- ARE YOU SURPRISED?
- CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

20:31.300 --> 20:33.533
- YEAH, THAT'S RUDE.
- I TOLD YOU SHE WAS
GONNA LEAVE.

20:33.567 --> 20:35.567
- THAT WAS COMPLETELY
RUDE, UNBELIEVABLE.
- BY THE WAY,

20:35.600 --> 20:37.600
I TIMED IT.
THERE WERE SIX MINUTES
LEFT IN THAT MOVIE.

20:37.633 --> 20:40.267
IRRELEVANT, LARRY.
SHE WAS NOT GONNA
WAIT FOR YOU.

20:40.300 --> 20:42.700
I INVESTED
AN HOUR AND A HALF.
I'M SUPPOSED TO LEAVE

20:42.733 --> 20:44.967
- WITH SIX MINUTES TO GO?
- THE LAST SIX MINUTES.
THAT'S CRAZINESS.

20:45.000 --> 20:47.333
SO, FINE.
YOU WERE RIGHT
AND NOW YOU'RE ALONE.

20:47.367 --> 20:50.933
YEAH, WELL,
SHE HAS A TICKLE
IN HER ANUS ANYWAY.

20:50.967 --> 20:53.933
- SHE HAS A TICKLE IN HER ANUS?
- I THINK SO. SHE WAS
SQUIRMING IN HER SEAT.

20:53.967 --> 20:55.300
I DON'T WANNA HEAR IT.
LET'S GO.

20:55.333 --> 20:57.133
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THAT MOVIE STUNK,
BY THE WAY.

20:57.167 --> 21:00.633
NO, IT WAS GREAT.
YOU'RE CRAZY.

21:00.667 --> 21:02.200
SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA GO
TO THE BAT MITZVAH?

21:02.233 --> 21:04.100
EH, I DON'T WANT
TO GO BY MYSELF.

21:04.133 --> 21:06.100
AND CHERYL'S
GONNA BE THERE
WITH THIS GUY.

21:06.133 --> 21:07.933
SO WE'LL GET YOU
A DATE--

21:07.967 --> 21:11.067
MY NEXT-DOOR NEIGHBOR.
SHE'S A BELLY DANCER.

21:11.067 --> 21:12.767
SHE ALSO WAS
IN CIRQUE DU SOLEIL.

21:12.800 --> 21:14.600
YEAH, THAT'S THE ONE
WITH THE NOSE RINGS,
RIGHT?

21:14.633 --> 21:17.200
- SHE CAN TAKE 'EM OUT.
- THEN THERE'S A HOLE
IN THE NOSE.

21:17.233 --> 21:18.967
WE'LL JUST COVER IT
WITH MAKEUP.

21:19.067 --> 21:22.067
BLECH!

21:22.067 --> 21:23.700
DO YOU WANT ANY COFFEE?
I'M GONNA GO GET COFFEE.

21:23.733 --> 21:25.767
NO, I DON'T WANT
ANYTHING.

21:25.800 --> 21:29.100
Woman: THIS WAY. THIS IS
THE ONE I WAS TELLING YOU
THAT I THINK IS JUST PERFECT.

21:29.133 --> 21:31.333
- Man: THIS IS GREAT.
- YEAH, AVAILABLE THE FIRST
OF THE MONTH.

21:31.367 --> 21:33.200
ALL WE NEED IS
YOUR SIGNATURE
ON THE PAPERWORK.

21:33.233 --> 21:35.733
- THAT'S GREAT.
TWO MONTHS UPFRONT?
- UPFRONT.

21:35.767 --> 21:38.133
- TWO PARKING SPACES.
IT'S ALL YOURS.
- HOW DO YOU HEAT IT?

21:38.167 --> 21:40.433
OH, YOU'VE GOT
YOUR OWN THERMOSTAT
RIGHT THERE, SEE?

21:40.467 --> 21:43.400
I'VE GOT TO TAKE THIS.
WILL YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR ONE SECOND?

21:43.433 --> 21:46.367
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
- SURE. YEAH, OKAY, GOOD.

21:47.333 --> 21:48.767
HI, I'M JUST--

21:48.800 --> 21:50.933
HELLO!

21:50.967 --> 21:53.667
- HOW ARE YOU?
- I'M-- I'M GOOD.

21:53.700 --> 21:56.333
- ARE YOU
RENTING THE OFFICE...
- ( stammering )

21:56.367 --> 21:58.500
- ...NEXT DOOR?
- YOU KNOW, I'M THINKING
ABOUT IT.

21:58.533 --> 22:02.567
THAT'S VERY GOOD.
WE'LL BE FRIENDS.

22:02.600 --> 22:05.967
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I'M LOOKING AT
SEVERAL PLACES.

22:06.067 --> 22:08.200
- I SHOULD PROBABLY CATCH UP--
- WE'LL GO TO LUNCH TOGETHER.

22:08.233 --> 22:10.167
- YEAH.
- EVERY DAY, EVERY DAY.

22:10.200 --> 22:12.700
- EVERY DAY.
- EVERY DAY, LUNCH.

22:12.733 --> 22:14.933
UH, LISTEN,
YOU'RE PROBABLY BUSY.

22:14.967 --> 22:16.600
NO, I'M NOT.
I HAVE NOTHING
TO DO HERE.

22:16.633 --> 22:18.833
I'VE GOT TO FIND
THE OFFICE MANAGER.
THANK YOU.

22:18.867 --> 22:20.767
GOODBYE.
BYE.

22:20.800 --> 22:22.933
I HOPE YOU RENT
THE OFFICE.

22:22.967 --> 22:25.400
LARRY, WH--?

22:25.433 --> 22:27.533
- OH, HEY.
- AM I INTERRUPTING
SOMETHING?

22:27.567 --> 22:29.067
NO.

22:29.067 --> 22:31.067
I JUST CAME BY
TO SAY THANKS

22:31.067 --> 22:32.967
FOR THE RECOMMENDATION.
I GOT THE GIG.

22:33.067 --> 22:34.667
- YOU GOT THE JOB?
- YEAH.

22:34.700 --> 22:37.133
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?
IS THIS SUPPOSED
TO BE FUNNY?

22:37.167 --> 22:38.500
NO NO NO.

22:38.533 --> 22:40.933
SOMEONE WAS GONNA
RENT THE OFFICE
NEXT DOOR...

22:40.967 --> 22:43.533
THIS IS HOW YOU WELCOME HIM?
YOU USE SOME HUMOR?

22:43.567 --> 22:46.333
NO NO NO,
IT WAS A TEST TO SEE
IF HE'S A TOLERANT PERSON.

22:46.367 --> 22:48.400
AND ANYONE WHO'S NOT
IS NO NEIGHBOR OF MINE.

22:48.433 --> 22:50.300
I KNOW SOMEBODY
WHO WOULDN'T FIND THIS
FUNNY AT ALL.

22:50.333 --> 22:53.200
HE'S A 10-YEAR-OLD BOY
NAMED MAX AND HE LIVES
IN MY HOUSE--

22:53.233 --> 22:55.400
- WHO'S NOT GONNA THINK
THAT'S SO FUNNY.
- OH, JEEZ.

22:55.433 --> 22:57.400
THIS IS WHAT YOU DO?
YOU SIT ON YOUR ASS

22:57.433 --> 22:59.433
- MAKING FUN
OF RETARDED PEOPLE?
- OH, COME ON.

22:59.467 --> 23:01.333
- UN-FUCKING-BELIEVABLE.
- I WAS JUST, YOU KNOW--

23:01.367 --> 23:02.833
I'M REALLY
DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

23:02.867 --> 23:05.067
I WOULD RENT AN OFFICE
TO YOUR SON.

23:05.067 --> 23:07.467
MY SON HAS AN OFFICE
ON THE RIGHT HAND
OF JESUS.

23:07.500 --> 23:10.067
HEY, YOU KNOW
WHAT'S REALLY FUNNY?

23:10.100 --> 23:13.267
A SUCCESSFUL
WRITER-PRODUCER WHO PUTS
GERBILS UP HIS ASS FOR FUN.

23:13.300 --> 23:16.367
- WHAT? WHAT?
- I TALKED TO KAI.
I TALKED TO MY COUSIN.

23:16.400 --> 23:18.600
- THAT'S WHY YOU HAD
TO SEE THE DOCTOR.
- OH, THAT'S BULLSHIT.

23:18.633 --> 23:20.633
- 'CAUSE YOU HAVE
GERBILS IN YOUR ASS.
- I MADE THAT UP, YOU MORON.

23:20.667 --> 23:22.733
- WHY WOULD YOU MAKE
SOMETHING LIKE THAT UP?
- BECAUSE I DIDN'T FEEL

23:22.767 --> 23:25.067
- LIKE TELLING HER
WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME.
- THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

23:25.067 --> 23:28.300
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE
WOULD GET A KICK OUT OF THIS.

23:28.333 --> 23:30.333
I REALLY DO.
FUCK YOU, LARRY.

23:30.367 --> 23:32.133
LET'S JUST TRY IT OUT
ON THE STREET.

23:32.167 --> 23:34.600
- HEY, NO, I MADE THAT UP.
- HEY, WANNA HEAR
SOMETHING FUNNY?

23:34.633 --> 23:36.267
HEY, YOU WANNA HEAR
SOMETHING FUNNY?

23:42.167 --> 23:44.933
SO SORRY.
DO WE STILL HAVE TIME
TO DO IT?

23:44.967 --> 23:46.800
- I'M SORRY.
- NO. I'M LATE NOW.

23:46.833 --> 23:48.700
- IT'S TOO LATE FOR LUNCH?
- IT'S TOO LATE FOR LUNCH

23:48.733 --> 23:50.267
AND IT'S TOO LATE
FOR MY CAREER

23:50.300 --> 23:51.967
AND YOU FUCKED ME
WITH TESSLER.

23:52.067 --> 23:54.400
- HE'S NOT WORKING OUT?
- HE SUCKS!

23:54.433 --> 23:56.600
- HE DOESN'T KNOW COMEDY.
- I KNOW THAT, I KNOW.

23:56.633 --> 23:58.733
HE SHOULD BE
SELLING FABRICS.

23:58.767 --> 24:00.667
WHY'D YOU HIRE HIM?

24:00.700 --> 24:02.633
HOW D--?
YOU--

24:02.667 --> 24:04.700
MY FRIEND OF 47 YEARS--
YOU RECOMMENDED HIM.

24:04.733 --> 24:07.133
OH, I RECOMMENDED HIM?
WHEN I CALLED YOU

24:07.167 --> 24:09.233
I TOLD YOU
THAT HE ASKED ME
TO RECOMMEND HIM...

24:09.267 --> 24:12.300
- WHAT--?
- ...SO I'M "RECOMMENDING" HIM.
I PUT QUOTES AROUND IT.

24:12.333 --> 24:14.367
WHY'D YOU "RECOMMEND" HIM,
MR. QUOTEHEAD?

24:14.400 --> 24:17.367
I THOUGHT THAT YOU
WOULD PICK UP THAT IT WAS
A NON-RECOMMEND RECOMMEND.

24:17.400 --> 24:20.067
YOU KNOW, LIFE IS
VERY BRIEF, OKAY?

24:20.100 --> 24:22.067
AND YOU KNOW I NEED
A GOOD SERIES.

24:22.100 --> 24:25.300
- IS LIFE TOO SHORT?
YOU THINK IT'S TOO SHORT?
- YEAH.

24:25.333 --> 24:28.367
- IT'S TOO SHORT, ISN'T IT?
- YEAH, BUT NOW MY LIFE IS
FUCKING WAY SHORT.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.233
- I'M SORRY.
- YOU RUINED MY
FUCKING PILOT

24:30.267 --> 24:31.600
BECAUSE OF YOUR
RECOMMENDATION.

24:31.633 --> 24:34.100
I CAN SEE IF IT CAME
FROM A SKINHEAD...

24:34.133 --> 24:36.100
- YEAH.
- ...OR ONE OF
BEN LADEN'S PEOPLE.

24:36.133 --> 24:38.067
YOU CALL HIM
BEN LADEN OR BIN LADEN?

24:38.067 --> 24:39.733
I DON'T KNOW.

24:39.767 --> 24:41.867
YOU CALLED HIM BEN.
THAT'S ALMOST LIKE
A JEWISH NAME.

24:41.900 --> 24:43.733
THAT'S TRUE.
BEN LADEN DOES SOUND

24:43.767 --> 24:45.633
- LIKE A SHIRT-MAKER
IN MANHATTAN.
- YES, I KNOW.

24:45.667 --> 24:47.667
"LET'S GO TO BEN LADEN'S.
THEY GOT GREAT COLLARS."

24:47.700 --> 24:49.700
EXACTLY, YEAH.
ANYWAY, I'M--

24:49.733 --> 24:51.667
- NO--
- I'M SORRY.

24:51.700 --> 24:53.900
YEAH, FINE, FI--

24:55.067 --> 24:56.867
IT'S TRUE, ISN'T IT?

24:56.900 --> 24:59.900
- HOLY SHIT.
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

25:00.067 --> 25:01.767
DID YOU STICK A GERBIL
UP YOUR ASS?

25:01.800 --> 25:04.167
- 'CAUSE THE WHOLE
FUCKING TOWN--
- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

25:04.200 --> 25:06.167
IT'S ALL OVER THE SET.
IT'S EVERYWHERE.

25:06.200 --> 25:08.167
- AND I SAID---
- JESUS,

25:08.200 --> 25:10.833
THIS TESSLER IS SPREADING
THIS RUMOR ABOUT ME

25:10.867 --> 25:12.500
TO GET BACK AT ME.

25:12.533 --> 25:14.167
IT'S ALL OVER
THE FUCKING CITY NOW.

25:14.200 --> 25:16.067
IT'S GONNA BE
ON THE INTERNET TOO.

25:16.067 --> 25:18.067
IT'S EVERYWHERE.
IT'S EVERYWHERE.

25:19.500 --> 25:21.533
JESUS CHRIST,
DID YOU SEE THE WAY
THAT GUY LOOKED AT ME?

25:21.567 --> 25:23.567
I'M SURE HE PROBABLY
READ "GERBIL" MAGAZINE

25:23.600 --> 25:25.767
AND YOU'RE
FUCKING ON THE COVER.

25:25.800 --> 25:27.933
HOLY SHIT.

25:27.967 --> 25:31.867
YOU KNOW, I DO HAVE
A TICKLE IN MY ANUS.

25:31.900 --> 25:33.867
OH, REALLY?

25:33.900 --> 25:36.200
- YEAH.
- I GOTTA SPLIT.

25:40.067 --> 25:42.100
HI, CAROL.

25:43.200 --> 25:45.167
CAROL,

25:45.200 --> 25:47.100
IT'S NOT TRUE.

25:47.133 --> 25:50.600
- ( family chattering )
- Leon: ...SOME CRAZY SHIT.

25:50.633 --> 25:52.600
- IT'S MISSING.
AND YOU HEAR THIS SHIT.
- LEON!

25:52.633 --> 25:55.067
LEON, I DON'T REALLY THINK
HE WOULD DO SOMETHING
LIKE THAT.

25:55.067 --> 25:56.700
- I DON'T THINK--
- YOU DON'T KNOW, LORETTA.

25:56.733 --> 25:59.067
THINK ABOUT IT.
LOOK, THE GERBIL'S
MISSING, RIGHT?

25:59.067 --> 26:01.200
AND THEN YOU HEAR
THIS SHIT'S GOING ON.
COME ON NOW.

26:01.233 --> 26:03.367
- ( women exclaiming )
- ADD THIS SHIT UP.
ADD THIS SHIT UP.

26:03.400 --> 26:05.900
HERE HE COMES NOW.
WHAT'S GOING ON, LARRY?
WHAT'S GOING ON, LARRY?

26:05.933 --> 26:08.333
THE GERBIL GOT
ON THE ELEVATOR, HIT "UP"

26:08.367 --> 26:11.300
- AND WENT UP YOUR ASSHOLE?
IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?
- Loretta: LEON!

26:11.333 --> 26:14.667
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT THIS THING HAS ALREADY
GOTTEN TO THIS HOUSE,

26:14.700 --> 26:16.967
- THAT YOU WOULD
ACCUSE ME OF THAT.
- LARRY, WHERE'S THE GERBIL?

26:17.067 --> 26:19.367
- I GOT YOUR BACK, L.D.
I DON'T THINK YOU DID IT.
- THANK YOU.

26:19.400 --> 26:21.067
I DIDN'T EVEN WANT
THAT THING IN THE HOUSE,

26:21.067 --> 26:23.300
- MUCH LESS PUT IT
UPY ASS, OKAY?
- LET HIM OUT, LARRY.

26:23.333 --> 26:26.400
SO, WAIT A MINUTE.
ARE YOU SAYING YOU DIDN'T
DO THAT?

26:26.433 --> 26:28.767
ABSOLUTELY.
OF COURSE NOT.
COME ON, THAT'S INSANE.

26:28.800 --> 26:30.833
- ( sighs )
- THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT.

26:30.867 --> 26:32.667
I'M STILL SICK
ABOUT THE FACT
THAT THAT THING IS

26:32.700 --> 26:34.400
RUNNING AROUND
THE HOUSE SOMEWHERE.

26:34.433 --> 26:36.833
- Leon: YEAH, ALL RIGHT.
WHATEVER, MAN.
- WE'RE DONE PACKING.

26:36.867 --> 26:38.667
- Loretta: ALL RIGHT.
- ALL RIGHT, SWEETNESS.

26:38.700 --> 26:41.700
- HEY, Y'ALL GOT
EVERYTHING TOGETHER?
- YEAH, WE'RE DONE.

26:41.733 --> 26:44.500
- ALL RIGHT, THAT'S GOOD.
- Leon: YOU READY TO ROLL?

26:44.533 --> 26:47.633
WOW, THIS IS REALLY
HAPPENING, ISN'T IT?

26:47.667 --> 26:49.733
- OH YEAH, WE'RE ABOUT
READY TO BOUNCE.
- YEAH.

26:49.767 --> 26:51.533
- WHEN ARE YOU GOING?
- TOMORROW.

26:51.567 --> 26:53.700
- TOMORROW?
- MM-HMM.

26:53.733 --> 26:56.700
( Auntie Rae chuckling )
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

26:56.733 --> 26:59.333
- Leon: WE'RE OUT
OF HERE, MAN.
- OH MY GOD.

26:59.367 --> 27:03.067
- WOW.
- Leon: IT CREPT UP
ON YOU, RIGHT?

27:03.067 --> 27:05.067
YOU'RE GONNA
MISS US, LARRY.

27:05.100 --> 27:06.733
Auntie Rae:
WE'RE GONNA
MISS YOU TOO, LARRY.

27:06.767 --> 27:08.667
ALL RIGHT, DON'T GET MY
WATERWORKS GOING HERE.

27:08.700 --> 27:10.867
- YOU KNOW
HOW EMOTIONAL I AM.
- ALL RIGHT, OKAY.

27:10.900 --> 27:13.067
Leon:
WE'RE GONNA MISS YOU, LARRY.
THAT'S DEEP.

27:13.067 --> 27:16.567
YEAH. ALL RIGHT,
I'VE GOT TO GET READY
FOR A BAT MITZVAH.

27:16.600 --> 27:19.067
- WHAT'S THAT?
- IT'S A JEWISH CEREMONY,
YOU KNOW.

27:19.100 --> 27:20.600
- OH.
- IT'S A BIG PARTY.

27:20.633 --> 27:22.733
YOU DON'T WANNA
GO WITH ME, DO YOU?

27:22.767 --> 27:25.867
- YOU WANT ME TO GO?
- YEAH, COME ON.

27:25.900 --> 27:28.200
SURE, I'LL GO
WITH YOU, L.D.

27:28.233 --> 27:29.933
- BEAUTIFUL.

27:49.067 --> 27:51.667
- THANK YOU.
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
- NACHES TO YOU.

27:51.700 --> 27:54.067
YOU SAW
THE EARLY REHEARSALS.
WHEN YOU LEFT

27:54.067 --> 27:56.467
THEY HAD A RUN-THROUGH.
THE NETWORK STORMED OUT.

27:56.500 --> 27:59.867
HOW IN THE FUCK
COULD MY BEST FRIEND
RECOMMEND SUCH AN ASSHOLE?

27:59.900 --> 28:02.800
- WHY DIDN'T YOU SAY
YOU DIDN'T LIKE HIM?
- ANY NORMAL PERSON

28:02.833 --> 28:04.633
WOULD HAVE PICKED UP
ON WHAT I WAS
TRYING TO SAY.

28:04.667 --> 28:06.667
NOW I'M ABNORMAL.
OH, NOW I'M NOT NORMAL.

28:06.700 --> 28:08.667
YEAH, YOU ARE ABNORMAL.

28:08.700 --> 28:10.967
YOU'RE THE MOST ABNORMAL,
JERKY NUTCASE

28:11.067 --> 28:12.833
I'VE EVER MET
IN MY ENTIRE--

28:12.867 --> 28:15.433
- OH, YOU THINK YOU'RE
MORE NORMAL THAN ME?
- FUCKIN'-A I AM.

28:15.467 --> 28:17.467
I'LL HAVE
A MENTAL PATIENT FACE-OFF
WITH YOU ANY DAY.

28:17.500 --> 28:21.067
- OH, REALLY?
- HEY, LARR, DID YOU STICK
A GERBIL UP YOUR ASS?

28:21.067 --> 28:23.200
- WHO TOLD YOU THAT?
- I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU
WHO TOLD ME.

28:23.233 --> 28:25.567
- IT'S NOT IMPORTANT.
- OF COURSE I DIDN'T STICK
A GERBIL UP MY ASS!

28:25.600 --> 28:27.900
- DON'T GET SO UPSET.
- I'M UPSET!

28:27.933 --> 28:29.667
- HE'S TELLING EVERYONE.
- YEAH, HE SURE IS.

28:29.700 --> 28:31.833
- Woman: OH MY GOD.
- ( laughing )

28:34.967 --> 28:37.933
( glass dinging )

28:37.967 --> 28:40.567
ON BEHALF OF MY
WONDERFUL WIFE SUSIE

28:40.600 --> 28:43.067
AND MYSELF
I WANT TO WELCOME YOU.

28:43.100 --> 28:45.167
THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH
FOR COMING.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.700
IT MEANS A LOT TO US,

28:47.733 --> 28:50.067
A LOT TO SAMMIE,

28:50.100 --> 28:54.067
I CAN TELL YOU THAT.
WE'RE VERY PROUD OF HER.

28:54.067 --> 28:56.067
I DON'T WANT
TO EMBARRASS HER,

28:56.067 --> 28:58.067
SO I'M GONNA
KEEP THIS SHORT
AND JUST SAY

28:58.067 --> 29:00.100
THANK YOU
FROM THE BOTTOM
OF OUR HEARTS.

29:00.133 --> 29:02.600
WHAT WE'RE GONNA
DO RIGHT NOW IS
OPEN IT UP

29:02.633 --> 29:04.933
TO ANYBODY WHO'D LIKE
TO SAY SOMETHING,

29:04.967 --> 29:07.867
MAKE A TOAST, WHATEVER.
COME ON UP.

29:07.900 --> 29:10.300
- YEAH, I'M GONNA--
- Both: LARRY.

29:10.333 --> 29:13.567
- I'D LIKE TO SAY SOMETHING.
- ALL RIGHT.

29:15.600 --> 29:17.333
HEY.
UM...

29:17.367 --> 29:21.200
WELL, FIRST OF ALL,
I'M SO THRILLED

29:21.233 --> 29:23.667
TO BE HERE AT SAMMIE'S
BAT MITZVAH TONIGHT.

29:23.700 --> 29:26.067
- THANK YOU, LARRY.
- THIS IS A FANTASTIC
OCCASION.

29:26.067 --> 29:28.233
YOU KNOW,
I'VE KNOWN SAMMIE

29:28.267 --> 29:30.733
SINCE SHE WAS BORN,
ACTUALLY.

29:30.767 --> 29:32.633
- I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL,
REMEMBER?
- YEAH.

29:32.667 --> 29:34.600
I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL
THAT DAY

29:34.633 --> 29:37.367
AND I SAW HER
WHEN SHE WAS, LIKE,
FIVE MINUTES OLD.

29:37.400 --> 29:39.533
IT WAS NOT A PRETTY
SIGHT FOR ME.

29:39.567 --> 29:42.067
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME
I EVER SAW ONE OF THOSE
THINGS, YOU KNOW.

29:42.067 --> 29:44.600
UM, ANYWAY,
WHAT I REALLY WANT
TO TALK ABOUT TONIGHT

29:44.633 --> 29:48.400
IS THAT
THERE'S A GUEST HERE

29:48.433 --> 29:51.067
SPREADING A VICIOUS,
NASTY, SCURRILOUS RUMOR

29:51.067 --> 29:53.067
- ABOUT ME AND A GERBIL.
- ( murmuring )

29:53.067 --> 29:54.833
OKAY? I'M SURE
YOU'VE HEARD IT.

29:54.867 --> 29:57.867
AND THERE'S NOT
A WORD OF TRUTH
TO IT, OKAY?

29:57.900 --> 30:00.733
HE HAS A PERSONAL VENDETTA,
SO DON'T BELIEVE
ONE WORD OF THAT.

30:00.767 --> 30:04.033
IT'S NOT TRUE.
HOWEVER,

30:04.067 --> 30:06.033
IN THE INTEREST
OF FULL DISCLOSURE

30:06.067 --> 30:08.033
I WILL TELL YOU
THAT, UM,

30:08.067 --> 30:09.900
I DO HAVE A TICKLE
IN MY ANUS.

30:09.933 --> 30:13.633
- ( crowd groaning )
- AND THEY'RE SLIGHTLY
RELATED TO EACH OTHER.

30:13.667 --> 30:15.633
Marty:
WHAT DID HE SAY?

30:15.667 --> 30:18.067
Larry:
THE POINT IS, IT'S NOT TRUE.
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS

30:18.100 --> 30:20.133
- IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT.
- Susie: THAT'S FINE, LARRY.

30:20.167 --> 30:22.700
- BECAUSE IT'S NOT RIGHT
THAT HE WOULD SPREAD...
- THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

30:22.733 --> 30:25.367
- ...THAT VICIOUS RUMOR.
- LARRY, THANK YOU
VERY MUCH. ENOUGH.

30:25.400 --> 30:27.633
Larry:
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING AT,
TESSLER?

30:27.667 --> 30:29.933
I'LL PUT
A FIST UP YOUR ASS.

30:29.967 --> 30:32.500
HOW ABOUT THAT,
HUH?

30:32.533 --> 30:34.500
WELL, UM,

30:34.533 --> 30:36.800
IF ANYONE ELSE
HAS A TOAST,

30:36.833 --> 30:38.867
SOMETHING TO SAY...

30:57.367 --> 30:59.433
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

31:03.600 --> 31:05.200
- Cheryl: HI.

SHE'S ALL GROWN UP.
- YEAH, I KNOW.

31:14.433 --> 31:16.433
- OH, YOUR UNDERWEAR--
- YES.

31:16.467 --> 31:19.167
- --GOT 'EM ON.
- MY UNDERWEAR?
YOU'RE IN THE NO-FLY ZONE?

31:19.200 --> 31:21.300
- I'M GOING
RIGHT OVER THE FENCE.
- YOU'RE OVER THE FENCE?

31:21.333 --> 31:22.933
- OVER THE FENCE.
- DID YOU MISS THE GATE?

31:22.967 --> 31:24.867
- NOT AT ALL.
- DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT THE GATE?

31:24.900 --> 31:27.433
- DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT IT.
- THAT'S WONDERFUL.
THANK YOU.

31:27.467 --> 31:31.067

31:41.133 --> 31:43.333
UM, YES. I MEAN,

( family yelling )

33:54.633 --> 33:57.733
OH, FUCK YOU, LARRY.
BULLSHIT, MOTHERFUCKER.

33:57.767 --> 33:59.867
- I DIDN'T KNOW.

ASSHOLE!

33:59.900 --> 34:02.900
- I CAN'T BEGIN TO TELL YOU.
- WHO THE FUCK DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE TALKING TO?

34:02.933 --> 34:04.400
DON'T NOBODY TALK
TO MY MAN LIKE THAT.

34:04.433 --> 34:06.433
YOU'D BETTER
GET YOUR ASS
