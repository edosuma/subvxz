Ya! Look at him rip.

00:51.970 --> 00:53.404
His fingers go from A-sharp

01:02.245 --> 01:06.412
Now you try.

01:06.446 --> 01:08.312
Whoa. Hold on.

01:08.346 --> 01:09.279
I got to get plugged in.

01:09.312 --> 01:10.812
Hey, where's the plug-in part?

01:10.845 --> 01:13.579
Back from the beginning, please.

01:28.847 --> 01:30.781
Damn it! I'm so close.

01:30.814 --> 01:35.148
Take it back one more time.

01:35.181 --> 01:36.181
You missed the first half

01:36.214 --> 01:38.081
of the first note.

01:38.114 --> 01:40.181
...You're a dick.

01:40.215 --> 01:41.482
[plays note]

01:41.515 --> 01:43.982
Yeah! This is how you do it.

01:44.015 --> 01:45.882
Can you all keep it

01:45.915 --> 01:47.315
down, please?

01:47.349 --> 01:48.415
Shut up, and listen to

01:48.449 --> 01:50.515
the wail of my banshee fingers.

01:50.549 --> 01:54.816
[playing electric guitar]

01:54.850 --> 01:56.783
What are you making?

01:56.816 --> 01:58.316
A time machine.

01:58.350 --> 02:00.683
That's dumb.

02:00.716 --> 02:01.783
Really?

02:01.816 --> 02:02.556
Yes.

02:02.590 --> 02:03.491
Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants,

02:03.524 --> 02:04.791
have you ever gone back in time?

02:04.824 --> 02:05.691
I farted my way

02:05.724 --> 02:06.757
out of an elevator.

02:06.791 --> 02:10.056
That's not the same thing.

02:10.091 --> 02:11.024
What's that thing

02:11.056 --> 02:12.024
on your face?

02:12.057 --> 02:13.991
Huh? Oh. Probably

02:14.024 --> 02:15.192
a zit or something.

02:15.225 --> 02:16.458
Well, look, I'm no doctor,

02:16.492 --> 02:17.958
but that right there

02:17.992 --> 02:21.258
looks like a...Melanoma.

02:21.291 --> 02:22.792
Well, it does kind of--

02:22.825 --> 02:23.492
Beef Bologna.

02:23.525 --> 02:24.958
Will you get out of here?!

02:24.992 --> 02:26.226
Damn it!

02:26.259 --> 02:28.426
I'm hitting the notes.

02:28.459 --> 02:29.626
You know, it's the guitar.

02:29.659 --> 02:30.993
give me that.

02:31.026 --> 02:36.593
[playing riffs]

02:36.626 --> 02:38.960
No. Now, this action is good.

02:38.994 --> 02:39.994
I think the problem

02:40.027 --> 02:41.294
is your hands.

02:41.327 --> 02:43.427
You've got some baby hands.

02:43.460 --> 02:45.427
This is totally

02:45.460 --> 02:46.594
going to work.

02:46.627 --> 02:47.660
Ok. I'm inside, and I got

02:47.694 --> 02:49.128
the doors and windows closed.

02:49.161 --> 02:50.328
Go on and do it.

02:50.361 --> 02:51.928
Roger that.

02:51.961 --> 02:53.828
Ooh...

02:53.861 --> 02:55.028
How's that feel?

02:55.061 --> 02:56.261
Ow! I can feel it

02:56.295 --> 02:57.561
getting bigger.

02:57.595 --> 02:58.461
They look like

02:58.495 --> 02:59.529
they're getting you

02:59.562 --> 03:00.662
in the eyeballs, too.

03:00.696 --> 03:02.636
Well...I know that.

03:02.669 --> 03:05.236
Ow! If I rip any solos

03:05.269 --> 03:06.902
with my eyeballs,

03:06.936 --> 03:08.069
I'm going to need the bees

03:08.102 --> 03:10.169
to enlarge them.

03:10.202 --> 03:11.570
Otherwise, I'd get on stage

03:11.603 --> 03:13.270
and look like a big asshole,

03:13.303 --> 03:15.437
and I am not that.

03:15.470 --> 03:17.770
Uh!

03:17.803 --> 03:19.470
Shake! Shake!

03:19.503 --> 03:20.537
Are you all right?

03:20.570 --> 03:22.238
I've never been better.

03:22.271 --> 03:23.671
Whoa. What's up

03:23.704 --> 03:25.138
with that face, man?

03:25.171 --> 03:26.738
Nothing. What do you mean?

03:26.771 --> 03:27.704
You tried to cover it up

03:27.738 --> 03:29.338
with makeup, like a girl.

03:29.371 --> 03:30.504
Can you tell? Really?

03:30.538 --> 03:31.404
Yeah. You look like...

03:31.438 --> 03:32.438
[clears throat]

03:32.471 --> 03:33.338
You ought to get

03:33.372 --> 03:34.439
that thing checked out.

03:34.472 --> 03:36.239
Every year, I get me a physical.

03:36.272 --> 03:37.205
Oh, really?

03:37.239 --> 03:38.305
And who's your doctor?

03:38.339 --> 03:39.972
Dr. John.

03:40.005 --> 03:42.305
Olivia Newton John.

03:42.339 --> 03:44.439
? I get a physical, physical ?

03:44.472 --> 03:45.840
On your face, boy

03:45.873 --> 03:47.240
on your face ?

03:47.273 --> 03:48.273
Please. Look, he's

03:48.306 --> 03:49.340
just playing around.

03:49.373 --> 03:50.473
But I'm serious.

03:50.506 --> 03:52.940
You will soon be paying

03:52.973 --> 03:55.406
to see me in a concert!

03:55.440 --> 03:56.407
I'm going to be

03:56.441 --> 03:57.374
honest with you.

03:57.407 --> 03:58.241
I don't like the look

03:58.274 --> 03:59.374
of this at all.

03:59.407 --> 04:01.841
So it's not an ingrown hair?

04:01.874 --> 04:03.047
Oh, no, no.

04:03.081 --> 04:04.947
It's irregular, which means some

04:04.981 --> 04:06.781
sort of sun damage probably.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.515
Really?

04:08.548 --> 04:09.882
We'll biopsy it and have some

04:09.915 --> 04:11.315
results for you within the week.

04:11.348 --> 04:12.815
I mean, it's probably

04:12.848 --> 04:13.948
nothing, right?

04:13.982 --> 04:16.482
Well...Let's hope not.

04:16.515 --> 04:18.382

04:22.683 --> 04:24.349
Hey! There he is.

04:24.383 --> 04:25.483
There's the man.

04:25.516 --> 04:26.783
This guy's got the biggest

04:26.816 --> 04:28.183
genital warts I've ever

04:28.216 --> 04:29.083
seen in my life.

04:29.116 --> 04:30.217
Would you stop it, Shake?

04:30.250 --> 04:31.150
I am not in the mood

04:31.184 --> 04:32.505
for this, ok?

04:38.883 --> 04:40.017
That's it.

04:40.050 --> 04:41.518
Now, who wants to make history

04:41.551 --> 04:43.385
and go back in time?

04:43.418 --> 04:47.285
Yeah. We're busy.

04:47.318 --> 04:48.418
Eat it.

04:48.451 --> 04:49.585
You eat it.

04:49.618 --> 04:51.085
You can meet

04:51.118 --> 04:52.719
President Lincoln.

04:52.752 --> 04:53.986
Lincoln is dead.

04:54.019 --> 04:56.152
I'll eat it...

04:56.186 --> 04:58.286
If you eat it.

04:58.319 --> 05:00.819
All right. Deal.

05:00.852 --> 05:02.892
Wait a minute.

05:02.926 --> 05:04.027
How are you going to eat it

05:04.060 --> 05:05.093
after I eat it?

05:05.127 --> 05:06.227
Look, you eat it.

05:06.260 --> 05:08.093
Then I'll go back in time

05:08.127 --> 05:09.160
to before the time

05:09.193 --> 05:10.393
when you eat it.

05:10.427 --> 05:12.260
Then I'll eat it.

05:12.293 --> 05:15.861
Ok.

05:15.894 --> 05:17.194
[gulp]

05:17.228 --> 05:18.728
[telephone rings]

05:18.761 --> 05:20.094

Oh. Oh, hey, doc.

[choking]

05:22.361 --> 05:23.361
Really?

05:23.394 --> 05:24.528
It's stuck in the back

05:24.561 --> 05:25.794
of my throat.

05:25.828 --> 05:28.062
Ok. Well, it can

05:28.095 --> 05:29.895
be cut out, right?

05:29.929 --> 05:32.895
Additional treatment? Uh-huh.

05:32.929 --> 05:34.829
[choking continues]

05:34.862 --> 05:39.296
Oh, uh...Chemotherapy. Ok.

05:39.330 --> 05:40.930
Thank you.

05:40.963 --> 05:42.796
What did your doctor say?

05:42.830 --> 05:45.063
He says I have cancer.

05:45.096 --> 05:47.463
Well, did you tell him

05:47.496 --> 05:49.096
that you don't?

05:49.130 --> 05:50.531
Meatwad, I'm afraid

05:50.564 --> 05:52.464
it doesn't work that way.

05:52.497 --> 05:54.864
What's wrong with him?

05:54.897 --> 05:56.297
He's dead.

05:56.331 --> 05:58.492
Dumb-ass ate a scorpion.

06:03.138 --> 06:04.172
So when will you find out

06:04.205 --> 06:05.405
about the blood test?

06:05.438 --> 06:06.672
it won't be for another week,

06:06.705 --> 06:08.038
but you're looking good.

06:08.072 --> 06:09.338
You're looking good.

06:09.372 --> 06:12.239
Yeah. Yeah. Uh-huh. Thanks.

06:12.273 --> 06:13.873
Stay strong, ok?

no electric bill.

Perfect. Shh. Shh. Quiet.

I want to have a party ?

Live in our living room.

06:53.009 --> 06:53.909

I'm gonna have a party

06:55.209 --> 06:56.642

06:57.677 --> 06:58.943
the party's getting started

06:58.977 --> 07:00.610
I know what kind of party-- ?

07:00.643 --> 07:02.417
[door slams]

07:02.450 --> 07:03.917
Oh, God. He looks

07:03.950 --> 07:05.183
like he's dead already.

07:05.217 --> 07:05.917
Thanks, Carl.

07:05.950 --> 07:06.783
Appreciate that.

07:06.817 --> 07:08.083
I think the problem

07:08.117 --> 07:09.818
was the song.

07:09.851 --> 07:11.818
You got any other...You know,

07:11.851 --> 07:16.352
happier songs about partying?

07:18.418 --> 07:19.551
? Party, party, party ?

07:19.584 --> 07:20.852
Hey! Let's party!

07:20.885 --> 07:22.419
Let's have a party tonight!

07:22.452 --> 07:24.052
Will you get out of here?

07:24.085 --> 07:25.285
[coughing]

07:25.319 --> 07:26.252
Look, my doctor says

07:26.285 --> 07:27.185
I need to get as much

07:27.219 --> 07:28.452
rest as possible, ok?

07:28.485 --> 07:29.452
Yeah. Hey.

07:29.485 --> 07:34.220
Get the funk outta here!

07:34.253 --> 07:37.720
And I am now leaving as well.

07:37.753 --> 07:40.586
What are we gonna do if...

07:40.620 --> 07:42.887
What if Frylock dies?

07:42.921 --> 07:43.687
Don't say that.

07:43.721 --> 07:45.321
Don't you ever say that.

07:45.354 --> 07:46.687
Don't you understand?

07:46.721 --> 07:49.121
He's in this all by himself.

07:49.154 --> 07:50.487
He needs for us

07:50.521 --> 07:53.254
to be strong for him.

07:53.287 --> 07:54.522
And we need him to know

07:54.555 --> 07:55.455
that we are going to be

07:55.488 --> 07:56.855
right by his side

07:56.888 --> 07:58.788
through this till the end.

07:58.822 --> 08:00.388
I just don't know

08:00.422 --> 08:02.195
what I would do.

08:02.228 --> 08:05.329
Come here. He'll be fine.

08:05.363 --> 08:07.596
He's going to be fine.

08:07.629 --> 08:11.229
He always did so much for me.

08:11.263 --> 08:14.629
I can't be here right now.

08:14.663 --> 08:18.164
Wait. I have an idea.

08:18.197 --> 08:20.497
Gentlemen, we have

08:20.530 --> 08:22.564
a time machine, and this is

08:22.597 --> 08:25.797
the key to Frylock's health.

08:25.830 --> 08:28.565
We can break it apart,

08:28.598 --> 08:29.665
light it on fire,

08:29.698 --> 08:30.731
and smoke the Cancer out.

08:30.765 --> 08:31.798
But don't smoking,

08:31.831 --> 08:33.164
like, cause Cancer?

08:33.198 --> 08:34.530
That has never been proven.

08:34.565 --> 08:35.265
Do whatever

08:35.298 --> 08:36.298
the hell you want.

08:36.331 --> 08:37.331
I don't care.

08:37.365 --> 08:39.265
Frylock, you come back.

08:39.299 --> 08:42.765
I must cure you.

08:42.799 --> 08:44.399
Damn it!

08:44.432 --> 08:46.066
Guys, I'm not supposed to

08:46.099 --> 08:47.466
be out in the sun.

08:47.499 --> 08:48.532
I know, buddy.

08:48.566 --> 08:50.567
But, uh...Well...

08:50.600 --> 08:51.967
I could...I mean,

08:52.000 --> 08:54.500
I could blow up the sun.

08:54.533 --> 08:55.633
That's it!

08:55.667 --> 08:57.500
I will blow up the sun!

08:57.533 --> 08:59.500
Where are you going?

08:59.533 --> 09:03.608
[coughing deeply]

09:03.641 --> 09:04.574
I really appreciate you

09:04.608 --> 09:05.741
letting me stay here

09:05.774 --> 09:06.974
for a while, Carl.

09:07.008 --> 09:08.374
Yeah. No problem.

09:08.408 --> 09:10.008
Anything, really.

09:10.041 --> 09:13.009
When...How long did they--

09:13.042 --> 09:14.709
did they say you had?

09:14.742 --> 09:16.109
They don't know.

09:16.142 --> 09:17.509
I supposed to meet

09:17.542 --> 09:19.375
with my doctor today.

09:19.409 --> 09:21.309
Sometime this month

09:21.342 --> 09:22.909
you think, or...

09:22.942 --> 09:24.776
I don't know, Carl.

09:24.810 --> 09:26.076
Probably. So definitely

09:26.110 --> 09:27.543
probably not this week?

09:27.576 --> 09:28.643
Just ballpark it for me.

09:28.676 --> 09:29.543
I don't know.

09:29.576 --> 09:30.210
[coughing]

09:30.243 --> 09:32.043
You're not like...

09:32.076 --> 09:33.676
Wiping Cancer all over

09:33.710 --> 09:35.076
my couch, right?

09:35.110 --> 09:37.444
You know, you really don't

09:37.477 --> 09:38.477
have to wear that.

09:38.511 --> 09:39.677
I know that.

09:39.711 --> 09:40.477
I figure, you know,

09:40.511 --> 09:41.877
I got house guests, so...

09:41.911 --> 09:42.877
A good idea to keep

09:42.911 --> 09:44.244
the pants on.

09:44.277 --> 09:45.644
Don't want to embarrass you

09:45.677 --> 09:47.345
'cause I got that big baby arm

09:47.378 --> 09:49.912
clutching an apple. Ha ha ha!

09:49.945 --> 09:51.778
Hanging low!

09:51.812 --> 09:55.612
Give us a sausage! Ha ha ha!

09:55.645 --> 09:59.579
Ok. Comedy doesn't work today.

09:59.613 --> 10:01.853
Hey, time to destroy

10:01.886 --> 10:03.686
the sun right now, buddy,

10:03.719 --> 10:05.153
and it's all for you, baby.

10:05.186 --> 10:07.319
Frylock forever!

10:07.353 --> 10:09.053
Light it up, Meatwad!

10:09.086 --> 10:10.320
I already done it,

10:10.354 --> 10:11.720
like, 5 minutes ago.

10:11.754 --> 10:12.920
I need my goggles!

10:12.954 --> 10:14.787
I need my U.V. Ray goggles!

10:14.820 --> 10:16.520
[boom]

10:16.554 --> 10:17.654
Well, we got

10:17.687 --> 10:18.887
your blood work back.

10:18.920 --> 10:20.054
And?

10:20.087 --> 10:21.921
No apparent trace of Cancer

10:21.955 --> 10:23.188
in the lymph nodes.

10:23.221 --> 10:24.921
Oh, God, thank you.

10:24.955 --> 10:26.321
You have no idea

10:26.355 --> 10:27.388
how great that is to hear.

10:27.421 --> 10:30.088
But, uh...Listen. Aliens.

10:30.121 --> 10:31.321
What?

10:31.355 --> 10:32.489
Yeah. The aliens are coming

10:32.522 --> 10:34.222
for us, you and I.

10:34.256 --> 10:35.122
That's why we must

10:35.156 --> 10:36.389
merge as one together

10:36.422 --> 10:39.756
to defeat them and their lasers.

10:39.789 --> 10:41.922
Hello? Mr. Lock?

10:41.956 --> 10:44.223
Well, we got your

10:44.257 --> 10:45.490
bloodwork back.

10:45.523 --> 10:46.657
And?

10:46.690 --> 10:48.023
No apparent trace

10:48.057 --> 10:49.557
of Cancer in the lymph nodes.

10:49.590 --> 10:51.323
Oh, God. Thank you.

10:51.357 --> 10:52.790
You have no idea how great

10:52.823 --> 10:53.823
that is to hear.

10:53.857 --> 10:55.558
But listen...

10:55.591 --> 10:57.091
I want you to stay out

10:57.124 --> 10:58.291
of the sun, plenty of rest,

10:58.324 --> 11:00.524
and I want to schedule another

11:00.558 --> 11:02.631
visit for you in 2 months.

11:02.664 --> 11:04.364
All right. No problem.

11:04.398 --> 11:05.431
We're not out

11:05.464 --> 11:07.226
of the woods yet.

11:11.932 --> 11:13.499
All right, then.

11:13.532 --> 11:14.265
Give me a sweet party

11:14.299 --> 11:15.365
party, party, party

11:15.399 --> 11:16.632
you've got a party

11:16.665 --> 11:17.900
I want a party

11:17.933 --> 11:19.166
who's gonna get

11:19.200 --> 11:22.966
this party started?

11:23.000 --> 11:25.000
Me!
