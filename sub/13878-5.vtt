Shake: I've been booted!

10:11.180 --> 10:12.250
Oh, hey, man.

10:12.280 --> 10:14.750
Whoa! Aaaah!

10:14.820 --> 10:15.820
A-all right. Okay.

10:15.850 --> 10:17.020
We're in luck. [ Chuckles ]

10:17.090 --> 10:20.460
Looks like I have a little ... little ...
little time in here in the schedule.

10:20.520 --> 10:24.190
I am the best hunter in the
world and in all the galaxy.

10:24.230 --> 10:29.170
Uh, yes, you've mentioned that in the
past, and yet your father hated hunt...

10:29.200 --> 10:30.270
don't do this.

10:30.300 --> 10:33.170
I-I-I thought we were past this.

10:33.240 --> 10:35.170
[ Growls ]

10:35.310 --> 10:37.070
"And he bleached the skulls"

10:37.110 --> 10:42.780
and spines in an acid bath, and he used
the teeth for a meat-scraping tool.

10:42.880 --> 10:45.820
'Happy Halloween, everybody!'

10:45.880 --> 10:47.080
and he collapsed.

10:47.120 --> 10:50.350
The aroma of blood and
bile was "overwhelming."

10:50.420 --> 10:52.160
The end.

10:52.190 --> 10:53.690
Both: Read it again!

10:53.720 --> 10:54.860
Read it again!

10:54.890 --> 10:55.990
No, no, no.

10:56.060 --> 10:57.330
Now, go to sleep.

10:57.360 --> 10:58.330
That's all.

10:58.360 --> 11:03.830
Tuck your feet under the pillow,
for the foot fairy comes tonight.
