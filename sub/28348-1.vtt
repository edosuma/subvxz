I will give you Aunt Mary
and my larger testicle

04:48.153 --> 04:50.986
if you just shut up!

04:50.988 --> 04:55.692
And deal.
Minus the testicle.

05:50.314 --> 05:52.815
Boom, bitches.

05:52.817 --> 05:55.519
What now? Oh, yeah.

05:55.521 --> 05:56.820
Mm-hmm.

05:56.822 --> 05:59.255
That's right. Oh, yeah.

05:59.257 --> 06:01.858
Ooh, yeah, you like that.

06:01.860 --> 06:03.760
Mmm, mmm, mwah.

06:03.762 --> 06:06.596
How'd my ass taste
when it was passing you, Joshy?

06:06.598 --> 06:08.130
I think
I'm gonna be sick.

06:08.132 --> 06:09.800
Yeah, me too.

06:09.802 --> 06:12.235
I'll never understand
how those two are together.

06:12.237 --> 06:14.036
No, I think she really
means she's gonna be sick.

06:14.038 --> 06:17.173
- Oh.
- Shit.

06:17.175 --> 06:18.642
Just like old times.

06:18.644 --> 06:21.478
- Josh, beer?
- Yeah.

06:26.117 --> 06:27.651
No offense,

06:27.653 --> 06:29.618
but your grandfather's place
is a dump.

06:29.620 --> 06:31.253
- Brandon.
- Well, it is.

06:31.255 --> 06:32.788
I'm not saying something
they don't know.

06:32.790 --> 06:34.858
It's been a long time
since we've seen it.

06:34.860 --> 06:36.493
At least ten years.

06:36.495 --> 06:38.661
I remember jumping
on that trampoline for days.

06:38.663 --> 06:40.430
It used to be
a happy place.

06:40.432 --> 06:42.199
- And now?
- Told you, it's a dump.

06:42.201 --> 06:44.401
And now it's our dump.

06:44.403 --> 06:46.735
You better believe it.

06:46.737 --> 06:48.437
To Pop Pop...

06:48.439 --> 06:51.207
who was awesome enough to leave
this house to our parents,

06:51.209 --> 06:53.375
who knew they weren't gonna do
shit with it,

06:53.377 --> 06:54.777
and gave it to us.

06:54.779 --> 06:55.978
To Pop Pop.

06:55.980 --> 06:58.380
To Pop Pop.

06:58.382 --> 07:00.817
Grace tells me
he drowned.

07:00.819 --> 07:04.253
Yeah, looks like he
slipped in on the north side.

07:04.255 --> 07:06.188
Never found the body.

07:06.190 --> 07:08.324
What? You mean
he's still there?

07:08.326 --> 07:11.297
- Yep.
- You're shitting me.

07:19.872 --> 07:21.771
Hey, guys...

07:21.773 --> 07:24.710
check this out.

07:26.011 --> 07:27.911
It's like he's still here.

07:27.913 --> 07:29.445
Maybe he is.

07:29.447 --> 07:32.751
Whoo-ooh!

07:36.788 --> 07:39.692
Weird.

08:00.411 --> 08:03.413
Hey, yo, Josh?
What's the Wi-Fi password?

08:03.415 --> 08:04.813
Don't have one, dude.

08:04.815 --> 08:06.084
No reception either.

08:07.386 --> 08:08.952
Aw, no vlogging
for Freddy.

08:08.954 --> 08:11.454
How are he and his six
followers going to survive?

08:11.456 --> 08:14.390
FYI, bitch-face,

08:14.392 --> 08:16.793
I'm over 400 now, right?

08:16.795 --> 08:19.628
Pretty soon, I'll have
more than you, DJ Asshat.

08:19.630 --> 08:21.798
In your wildest
wet dreams, Freddy.

08:21.800 --> 08:23.332
Whatever,
I'll just upload this shit

08:23.334 --> 08:25.235
when we get back
to civilization.

08:25.237 --> 08:27.002
Problem solved.

08:27.004 --> 08:28.137
Except for this poor guy.

08:31.242 --> 08:33.909
Think he's seen
better days, huh?

08:44.456 --> 08:47.290
Aah! Aah! Josh!

08:47.292 --> 08:49.191
Toby!

08:49.193 --> 08:50.960
Hey, what's wrong?

08:50.962 --> 08:52.397
It moved.

08:54.332 --> 08:55.967
Something's in there.

09:05.143 --> 09:07.710
Aah!

09:07.712 --> 09:09.546
Oh, my God.

09:09.548 --> 09:11.748
Brilliant reaction,
Toby. I loved it.

09:11.750 --> 09:13.682
- Fuck, Freddy!
- Ow, Jesus.

09:13.684 --> 09:15.384
I need a little bit more
from you next time.

09:15.386 --> 09:17.786
- Turn that shit off.
- Whoo!

09:17.788 --> 09:18.988
Take a look.

09:18.990 --> 09:20.623
Any reason
the basement's on lockdown?

09:20.625 --> 09:22.224
Oh, yeah, Pop Pop
was crazy like that.

09:22.226 --> 09:23.425
He always kept it locked.

09:23.427 --> 09:24.828
One time when Erin was eight,

09:24.830 --> 09:26.195
she got stuck in there
by mistake.

09:26.197 --> 09:27.631
I remember that.
She spent

09:27.633 --> 09:29.366
- the whole night down there.
- Oh, brutal.

09:29.368 --> 09:31.434
Trust me, you do not
want to get stuck down there.

09:35.841 --> 09:38.407
Toby, shut up.
Toby, shut up.

09:38.409 --> 09:39.945
- Knock it off.
- Toby.

09:42.913 --> 09:43.912
Okay, next one.

09:45.116 --> 09:49.919
And then Odysseus said,

09:49.921 --> 09:53.223
"For Zeus had smitten

09:53.225 --> 09:55.057
"my swift ship

09:55.059 --> 09:57.393
with his bright thunderbolt,

09:57.395 --> 10:00.063
"and it had shattered
in the mist

10:00.065 --> 10:02.568
of the wine-dark sea."

10:07.205 --> 10:08.405
Yeah.

10:08.407 --> 10:10.239
Damn.

10:10.241 --> 10:11.940
Damn. That's sick.

10:11.942 --> 10:14.076
Yo, I want a photographic
memory, T.

10:14.078 --> 10:15.344
Can you teach me?

10:15.346 --> 10:17.079
How sweet would that be...

10:17.081 --> 10:19.581
to be a god,
be like Zeus?

10:19.583 --> 10:20.949
Zeus was a slut.

10:20.951 --> 10:23.786
Perks of being
the All-father.

10:23.788 --> 10:25.689
I'm just saying
you should aspire

10:25.691 --> 10:29.626
to be someone higher
like Buddha or Yahweh.

10:29.628 --> 10:31.261
Yo, they don't have

10:31.263 --> 10:32.762
the fucking lightning bolts,
though.

10:34.566 --> 10:37.233
"Thou art dead, Testicles."

10:37.235 --> 10:40.302
Can I get a whoopeth-whoopeth?

10:40.304 --> 10:41.738
- No.
- No.

10:43.008 --> 10:45.074
Y'all suck.

10:52.517 --> 10:54.483
My God.

10:54.485 --> 10:56.486
He's... he's seriously
insane.

10:56.488 --> 10:57.921
He's got scouts
watching the games now.

10:57.923 --> 11:00.256
So he's really dedicated.
Fuck you.

11:00.258 --> 11:01.891
"Scouts."

11:08.767 --> 11:10.703
Hey.

11:59.817 --> 12:01.721
What?

12:10.327 --> 12:13.563
Oh!

12:13.565 --> 12:15.531
What is the name
of the game?

12:15.533 --> 12:17.199
Thumper!

12:17.201 --> 12:18.535
Why do we play?

12:18.537 --> 12:20.670
To get fucked up!

12:20.672 --> 12:24.373
Ugh! Ugh!

12:24.375 --> 12:26.044
Ugh! Ugh!

12:29.714 --> 12:32.382
Drink, motherfucker!
Drink, motherfucker!

12:32.384 --> 12:34.550
Drink, motherfucker!
Drink!

12:34.552 --> 12:36.386
- Whoo!
- Nice.

12:36.388 --> 12:37.753
All right,
keep going, keep going.

12:41.725 --> 12:44.596
Rodeo! Rodeo! Rodeo!

12:45.931 --> 12:47.229
Shit.

12:47.231 --> 12:49.398
Drink, motherfucker!
Drink, motherfucker!

12:49.400 --> 12:51.300
Drink, motherfucker!
Drink!

12:54.038 --> 12:56.171
What's the name of the game?

13:34.812 --> 13:41.251
♪ La-la, la-la,
la-la-la, la-la-la ♪

13:41.253 --> 13:47.757

14:17.022 --> 14:18.287
Thumper!

14:27.097 --> 14:30.300
Whoo!

14:31.403 --> 14:32.634
Ooh-ga-cha-ca.

14:50.889 --> 14:52.888
What's with
the friggin' balloon?

14:52.890 --> 14:55.525
It's the vibration.
It helps her feel the music.

14:55.527 --> 14:57.863
Get off your ass,
douche bag.

15:15.714 --> 15:18.080
You are a God.

15:26.691 --> 15:29.725
- This is so cray-cray.
- Yeah.

15:29.727 --> 15:31.127
I think the last time
we did this...

15:31.129 --> 15:32.261
We were eight.

15:32.263 --> 15:34.530
And now it is a tradition.

15:34.532 --> 15:36.866
My cooch is a popsicle.

15:43.341 --> 15:46.175
Holy shit.

15:46.177 --> 15:48.877
We are definitely
not in Kansas anymore.

15:48.879 --> 15:51.546
This is so not
like I remember it.

16:01.826 --> 16:04.127
Why didn't we do this
in high school?

16:04.129 --> 16:05.527
I don't know.

16:05.529 --> 16:10.199
Sometimes you got to step away
from a perfect thing

16:10.201 --> 16:12.768
to know
just how amazing it is.

16:12.770 --> 16:15.204
Perfect thing, huh?

16:15.206 --> 16:17.676
You know it.

16:22.679 --> 16:25.381
Okay, here's
the billion-dollar question.

16:25.383 --> 16:28.984
- Why am I with him?
- He's just so not you.

16:28.986 --> 16:34.190
Jock, pretty boy, caveman,

16:34.192 --> 16:36.124
steroid addict.

16:36.126 --> 16:40.729
Beautiful, intelligent,
wonderful, awesome Wiccan girl.

16:40.731 --> 16:42.632
A dark Wiccan girl.

16:42.634 --> 16:45.267
Sorry.
I forgot.

16:45.269 --> 16:48.204
Wiccans are nice witches
all into the Earth.

16:48.206 --> 16:50.772
Dark Wiccans are into
what's below it.

16:50.774 --> 16:52.874
- Still, it's a mismatch.
- I don't know.

16:52.876 --> 16:57.512
Dark Wiccan girl
one-night stand

16:57.514 --> 17:02.451
with jock, pretty boy
caveman leads

17:02.453 --> 17:05.353
- to 103 one-night stands...
- Oh, no, I can't.

17:05.355 --> 17:06.655
And counting.

17:09.160 --> 17:11.160
You know, pretty soon
you're going to have

17:11.162 --> 17:13.962
to start going
to his baseball games,

17:13.964 --> 17:15.998
serving him protein shakes
in bed,

17:16.000 --> 17:19.367
hanging with the ball wives
on the road!

17:19.368 --> 17:22.604
Hurrah! Go, Brandon!

17:22.606 --> 17:24.140
Kill me now.
Thank you.

17:24.142 --> 17:26.108
You do realize
that there could be

17:26.111 --> 17:31.046
someone out there that can
give you everything you want.

17:31.048 --> 17:33.882
And being with jockstrap is
kind of hurting your chances.

17:33.884 --> 17:36.454
Yeah, I know.

17:40.057 --> 17:43.025
Sometimes I even wonder
why we're together.

17:43.027 --> 17:46.595
I mean, he can be
an obnoxious jerk,

17:46.597 --> 17:48.463
like, most of the time.

17:48.465 --> 17:51.299
But...

17:51.301 --> 17:53.268
I don't know.

17:53.270 --> 17:55.971
He can be sweet,

17:55.973 --> 17:58.641
and the bottom line is,
he cares about me

17:58.643 --> 18:00.442
in his own way.

18:00.444 --> 18:01.776
Oh, I don't know.
Whatever.

18:01.778 --> 18:03.679
Until I can't handle it
anymore,

18:03.681 --> 18:06.414
I am just gonna
enjoy the ride...

18:06.416 --> 18:09.684
until I don't.

18:09.686 --> 18:11.754
I just don't want you
to get hurt.

18:11.756 --> 18:13.025
I know.

18:14.726 --> 18:17.096
And I appreciate it.

19:25.596 --> 19:29.968
<i>Before I lay me
down to sleep,</i>

19:30.999 --> 19:32.701
<i>I pray the Lord
my soul to keep.</i>

19:32.703 --> 19:35.805
<i>If I die before I wake,</i>

19:35.807 --> 19:40.409
<i>I pray the Lord
my soul to take.</i>

19:40.411 --> 19:41.811
<i>Amen.</i>

20:41.739 --> 20:44.140
Hey.

20:44.142 --> 20:45.641
- Whoa!
- Oh, my God,

20:45.643 --> 20:48.611
- oh, my God, oh, my God.
- Go, go, go, go, go!

20:51.548 --> 20:53.949
I was just
in the bathroom, and...

20:53.951 --> 20:57.219
Shh! It's okay.
It's okay.

20:57.221 --> 20:59.121
It's just a blown fuse.

20:59.123 --> 21:01.159
Where's the fuse box, dude?

21:03.094 --> 21:05.628
Shit.
It's locked.

21:05.630 --> 21:07.199
Where's the key?

21:12.470 --> 21:16.441
If memory serves,
it's in here.

21:23.013 --> 21:24.846
Hold this.

21:24.848 --> 21:27.551
Ew. Oh.

21:32.957 --> 21:34.422
Oh!

21:34.424 --> 21:37.325
- Fuck!
- Jesus, what is that?

21:37.327 --> 21:39.094
Something's rotting
down there.

21:39.096 --> 21:40.429
Or someone.

21:40.431 --> 21:41.963
Hey, guys,
I need the light here.

21:46.636 --> 21:48.506
And the bat.

21:57.347 --> 21:59.151
What the hell?

22:31.048 --> 22:33.551
Just get to the fuse box.

22:59.076 --> 23:01.744
Uh, guys?

23:11.888 --> 23:13.122
Ow!

23:20.198 --> 23:21.564
- Eww.
- Please tell me

23:21.566 --> 23:24.533
this is just a sick game
of hopscotch.

23:24.535 --> 23:27.836
It's a sick game
of hopscotch.

23:32.242 --> 23:36.812
I don't think
your grandfather was losing it.

23:36.814 --> 23:38.213
I think it was already lost.

23:38.215 --> 23:40.682
- No kidding.
- Guys...

23:40.684 --> 23:43.184
I know what this is.

23:44.555 --> 23:47.389
Okay, so this...
this summoning portal

23:47.391 --> 23:50.692
can summon a demon spirit
from the other side?

23:50.694 --> 23:52.327
Not just any.

23:52.329 --> 23:55.230
This spell book, or grimoire,

23:55.232 --> 23:57.900
it names someone
specifically...

23:57.902 --> 23:59.767
Beelzebub.

23:59.769 --> 24:00.869
Ooh.

24:00.871 --> 24:03.873
Now, he's one
of the seven princes of hell.

24:03.875 --> 24:05.774
Okay.

24:05.776 --> 24:07.910
Oh, my God.

24:07.912 --> 24:10.148
Hey, this is ridiculous.

24:11.147 --> 24:12.780
We have to jump on this.

24:12.782 --> 24:16.885
There's another spell
here to summon his legion.

24:16.887 --> 24:20.256
There's all these ordinances
and safeguards...

24:20.258 --> 24:22.924
how they can't go
through barriers uninvited,

24:22.926 --> 24:24.026
like locked doors

24:24.028 --> 24:25.494
And the fact that there's

24:25.496 --> 24:28.096
a circle of protection spell
to contain them

24:28.098 --> 24:30.431
suggests
that all this is bad...

24:30.433 --> 24:32.401
- Ooh...
- Like, really bad.

24:32.403 --> 24:34.636
Oh, sweet.
Now we really got to try it.

24:34.638 --> 24:37.238
No, it feels wrong.

24:37.240 --> 24:39.408
The energy I'm feeling is bad.

24:39.410 --> 24:40.808
We got to do this.

24:40.810 --> 24:42.510
We're in the middle
of fucking nowhere.

24:42.512 --> 24:44.947
- It's a no-brainer.
- But you heard her.

24:44.949 --> 24:47.149
This is probably
an evil demon.

24:47.151 --> 24:49.751
I say we live a little
and stop being pussies.

24:49.753 --> 24:52.755
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ,
Jesus Christ.

24:52.757 --> 24:55.623
Come on,
this is all just bullshit.

24:55.625 --> 24:57.459
We can't really conjure
a demon.

24:57.461 --> 24:59.929
That's, like, Wes Craven shit.

24:59.931 --> 25:01.596
Why is this bullshit?

25:01.598 --> 25:05.633
I mean, if people believe
angels are real,

25:05.635 --> 25:07.702
then why can't a demon be real?

25:07.704 --> 25:09.805
Of course it's bullshit.

25:09.807 --> 25:12.674
No offense, babe,
but we got to try this.

25:12.676 --> 25:14.709
I mean, look,
I'm about to go pro.

25:14.711 --> 25:17.613
This is my last chance to
do something crazy like this.

25:17.615 --> 25:20.048
Yeah, you're so
fucking drunk, dude.

25:20.050 --> 25:21.216
I am.

25:21.218 --> 25:22.985
What do you think, Grace?

25:22.987 --> 25:27.155
Well, like Brandon said,
I'm the expert demon conjurer.

25:27.157 --> 25:28.457
I'm in.

25:28.459 --> 25:30.726
Yeah, that's my little witch.

25:30.728 --> 25:35.698
But, hey, I will only
do it if everyone agrees to it.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.665
- Fine. Hands?
- Yeah.

25:37.667 --> 25:41.437
- Aw, come on, Kim.
- Aw, Kimbo!

25:41.439 --> 25:44.506
- Kimbo!
- Come on!

25:44.508 --> 25:50.411
Kimbo! Kimbo! Kimbo!
Kimbo! Kimbo!

25:50.413 --> 25:52.247
Yeah!

25:52.249 --> 25:55.517
Yeah!

25:55.519 --> 25:58.353
I can't wait to share
my stash with Beetlejuice.

25:58.355 --> 26:01.824
It's Beelzebub,
you retard.

26:01.826 --> 26:04.258
That's what I said...
Bellzefuck.

26:05.695 --> 26:07.930
Tonight we will journey
to a realm

26:07.932 --> 26:09.530
beyond sight and sound,

26:09.532 --> 26:11.834
beyond mind and substance,

26:11.836 --> 26:13.469
things and ideas,

26:13.471 --> 26:16.205
another dimension,
if you will...

26:16.207 --> 26:19.874
a dimension called
The Freddy Zone.

26:23.647 --> 26:25.780
Tonight my friends and I
will discover

26:25.782 --> 26:27.115
whether or not there is,
in fact,

26:27.117 --> 26:29.250
a world beyond our own,

26:29.252 --> 26:31.754
a dark dimension
where demons dwell,

26:31.756 --> 26:33.521
and our only hope for survival

26:33.523 --> 26:36.124
is my friend since
before I had pubes, Grace.

26:36.126 --> 26:37.426
Say hi, Grace.

26:37.428 --> 26:38.893
Turn that shit off,
Freddy.

26:38.895 --> 26:40.562
Will we discover
that there is, in fact,

26:40.564 --> 26:42.831
another world
beyond our own?

26:42.833 --> 26:44.365
Or will we just

26:44.367 --> 26:46.969
get wasted as fuck
and not find shit?

26:46.971 --> 26:49.071
Either way, it's still
a total win-win, right? Yeah!

26:49.073 --> 26:50.805
Freddy, I don't know
what's more annoying...

26:50.807 --> 26:52.207
you or the handheld
horror-movie bullshit.

26:52.209 --> 26:53.542
Turn it off.

26:53.544 --> 26:55.177
I just want
you all to know

26:55.179 --> 26:56.545
if anything
should happen to me,

26:56.547 --> 26:57.712
if I should get torn apart

26:57.714 --> 26:59.614
by three four-breasted succubi

26:59.616 --> 27:02.116
or three four-breasted succubi
who want to ravage my body

27:02.118 --> 27:03.719
with their...

27:03.721 --> 27:05.821
Turn that shit off
before I kick your fucking ass!

27:05.823 --> 27:08.257
Doing a "Blair Witch"
send-up.

27:08.259 --> 27:10.159
Kicking it old school,
bee-yatches!

27:10.161 --> 27:12.393
Now, Freddy.

27:12.395 --> 27:14.796
Sorry, guys.

27:14.798 --> 27:19.367
Got to keep the 418 loyal
Freddy followers satiated.

27:19.369 --> 27:21.069
First...

27:21.071 --> 27:24.073
I'm going to read
the circle of protection spell.

27:24.075 --> 27:25.239
What does that do, again?

27:25.241 --> 27:26.909
It prevents any demons

27:26.911 --> 27:29.911
or any souls, for that matter,
from leaving the circle.

27:29.913 --> 27:31.447
What,
like a quarantine?

27:31.449 --> 27:33.282
Yeah, exactly...
sort of.

27:33.284 --> 27:35.383
Okay, ready?

27:35.385 --> 27:37.819
Join hands, guys.

27:42.727 --> 27:44.459
- Whoo!
- Hmm.

27:44.461 --> 27:46.694
Hey.

27:46.696 --> 27:48.162
Okay.

27:48.164 --> 27:50.265
<i>Latet anguis in herba,</i>

27:50.267 --> 27:54.169
<i>Beneficium accipere libertatem
est vendere,</i>

27:54.171 --> 27:56.638
<i>Fallaces sunt rerum species,</i>

27:56.640 --> 27:59.107
<i>custodiet ipsos custodes,</i>

27:59.109 --> 28:03.312
<i>Necesse est multos timeat
quem multi timent,</i>

28:03.314 --> 28:06.849
<i>in nihilum
nil posse reverti.</i>

28:11.122 --> 28:12.720
Hey, Tara, see what?

28:12.722 --> 28:14.489
What did she say?

28:14.491 --> 28:16.525
She said she saw
a flash of light.

28:16.527 --> 28:18.462
Tara, you okay?

28:24.501 --> 28:25.968
Yeah.

28:25.970 --> 28:28.069
Yeah, there's
a fourth spell.

28:28.071 --> 28:30.572
It sends all conjured demons

28:30.574 --> 28:33.976
within the ritual symbol
back from whence they came.

28:33.978 --> 28:36.311
You okay with this?

28:36.313 --> 28:38.881
I can stop whenever.

28:38.883 --> 28:40.015
Fine.

28:40.017 --> 28:42.183
Okay.

28:42.185 --> 28:46.154
Now the summoning spell.

28:46.156 --> 28:50.526
It says we have to give
an offering of blood and flesh.

28:50.528 --> 28:52.861
- We have to kill somebody?
- No.

28:52.863 --> 28:55.863
We have to choose someone
to act as the vessel

28:55.865 --> 28:58.366
through which the spirits
can enter.

28:58.368 --> 28:59.567
Anyone?

28:59.569 --> 29:01.870
How about the vlogger?

29:01.872 --> 29:05.173
Yeah, you know how many
more followers you'd get

29:05.175 --> 29:06.975
if you were actually possessed?

29:06.977 --> 29:08.477
Yeah. No, thank you.

29:08.479 --> 29:09.710
Why don't you do it?

29:09.712 --> 29:13.484
- Hmm?
- You.

29:15.719 --> 29:18.386
You're always talking so big.
Why don't you back it up?

29:18.388 --> 29:20.488
Yeah...

29:20.490 --> 29:22.724
tough guy.

29:22.726 --> 29:26.894
Okay. All right. Fine.

29:26.896 --> 29:28.729
I'll do it.

29:30.867 --> 29:33.101
Since the rest of you
are a bunch of pussies.

29:33.103 --> 29:34.536
Oh!

29:34.538 --> 29:35.737
What do I got to do,
babe?

29:35.739 --> 29:37.104
That's my honeybee.

29:37.106 --> 29:38.207
You're so manly.

29:38.209 --> 29:39.574
Mm.

29:39.576 --> 29:42.009
Just sit in the middle.

29:42.011 --> 29:43.681
Okay.

29:49.452 --> 29:52.520
Okay,
join up again, guys.

29:54.525 --> 29:56.761
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

29:58.596 --> 30:01.063
<i>Coram populo,</i>

30:01.065 --> 30:05.100
<i>Legum servi sumus
ut liberi esse possimus,</i>

30:05.102 --> 30:09.036
<i>Videtis quantum scelus
contra rem publicam.</i>

30:12.609 --> 30:14.209
What's happening?

30:14.211 --> 30:16.678
It was just... just
a little gust of wind, right?

30:16.680 --> 30:18.113
In the fucking basement?

30:27.223 --> 30:28.759
Yo, Brandon.

30:33.230 --> 30:34.566
He's not moving.

30:38.903 --> 30:39.938
He's silent.

30:41.171 --> 30:43.372
Brandon.

30:45.276 --> 30:47.308
Yo, talk to me, buddy.

30:57.288 --> 31:00.555
Are you Brandon?

31:05.328 --> 31:08.029
I don't want
to do this anymore.

31:12.236 --> 31:14.469
- How do we know?
- What?

31:14.471 --> 31:16.904
- If he's possessed.
- He's not.

31:16.906 --> 31:18.273
But how do we know?

31:18.275 --> 31:20.007
We only just started
the spell,

31:20.009 --> 31:21.677
so the spirit isn't in him.

31:25.682 --> 31:29.584
Hey, anyone else
want to give it a try?

31:31.855 --> 31:34.855
- Freddy?
- I'm high, I'm not that high.

31:34.857 --> 31:36.991
Erin? What about you?

31:36.993 --> 31:38.528
Me? No.

31:39.296 --> 31:40.528
No.

31:44.335 --> 31:47.235
Guys, I just want
to have fun this weekend.

31:47.237 --> 31:48.703
Kimbo's right.

31:48.705 --> 31:51.006
We're riding
a serious buzzkill.

31:51.008 --> 31:53.941
Well, then let's ride
something else.

31:59.115 --> 32:02.784
And it's a bust,
mi amigos and amigas.

32:02.786 --> 32:04.853
No possession today,

32:04.855 --> 32:06.988
thanks to a major puss-out
by that guy.

32:06.990 --> 32:11.660
Oh, well, perhaps next time
on The Freddy Zone.

32:37.820 --> 32:39.988
Hey, Grace?

32:39.990 --> 32:43.290
<i>Legum servi sumus
ut liberi esse possimus.</i>

32:43.292 --> 32:44.959
Grace?

32:44.961 --> 32:46.862
<i>Videtis quantum scelus</i>

32:46.864 --> 32:49.131
<i>contra rem publicam
vobis nuntiatum sit?</i>

32:50.768 --> 32:51.799
<i>O praeclarum
custodem ovium lupum!</i>

32:51.801 --> 32:53.701
Hey, Grace?

32:53.703 --> 32:56.173
<i>Exegi monumentum
aere perennius!</i>

33:00.611 --> 33:02.914
What did you just do?

33:06.682 --> 33:08.784
What are you doing?

33:11.855 --> 33:14.322
Apparently nothing.

33:18.796 --> 33:22.197
Come on, let's go get wasted.

35:29.760 --> 35:31.659
Ah!

35:54.451 --> 35:56.517
It's okay.

36:23.646 --> 36:25.380
Mmm, mmm.

36:56.480 --> 36:58.412
Someone's got
the munchies.

37:05.621 --> 37:07.655
Slow down, speedy.

37:07.657 --> 37:11.094
Don't want you to choke now.

37:13.929 --> 37:15.597
Thanks.

38:34.411 --> 38:37.612
Oh!

38:56.599 --> 38:57.798
Yes.

39:02.304 --> 39:05.106
I fucking hate
that guy.

39:05.108 --> 39:08.075
Yeah.

39:08.077 --> 39:11.780
Oh, God.
Oh, I love your pussy.

39:11.782 --> 39:13.947
Oh, fuck.

39:13.949 --> 39:16.950
Oh, shit. Oh, fuck.

39:16.952 --> 39:18.753
You want it rough, huh?

39:18.755 --> 39:21.923
Maybe.

39:21.925 --> 39:24.992
Oh, God.

39:24.994 --> 39:27.162
Oh, fuck me.
Oh, my God.

39:27.164 --> 39:31.833
Oh my God!
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

39:33.869 --> 39:36.704
Ah...

39:36.706 --> 39:39.173
Mm!

39:39.175 --> 39:42.342
Oh...

40:49.945 --> 40:53.914
Oh. Oh.

40:53.916 --> 40:57.117
Let's see what you got.

40:57.119 --> 40:59.086
Mmm.

41:06.195 --> 41:09.764
No, no, no. I can't.
I shouldn't.

41:09.766 --> 41:11.469
You have a boyfriend, and...

41:13.737 --> 41:16.271
Oh, my God.

41:16.273 --> 41:19.206
Okay. Okay.

41:19.208 --> 41:20.477
Oh.

41:22.211 --> 41:23.711
Oh.

41:23.713 --> 41:26.079
Oh! Oh, fuck.

41:27.449 --> 41:31.621
I fucking knew it.
Fucking kinky.

41:33.023 --> 41:34.021
Ugh.

41:35.391 --> 41:38.825
Oh. All right.

41:38.827 --> 41:41.829
Oh, wait. Oh.

41:43.166 --> 41:46.800
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck.
Fuck, oh, God.

41:46.802 --> 41:51.305
Oh, God. Ah! Ah! Ah!

41:54.177 --> 41:58.012
Oh.

42:00.684 --> 42:02.717
Oh, my God.

42:05.322 --> 42:07.988
Hey, where you going?

42:11.561 --> 42:14.295
What up, what up, Freddies?

42:14.297 --> 42:16.731
You are not gonna believe
what just happened.

42:16.733 --> 42:19.800
Like it, share it,
re-tweet it.

42:19.802 --> 42:21.469
I'm talking better
than that time

42:21.471 --> 42:23.438
I bungied out
the fourth-story window

42:23.440 --> 42:25.940
in my dorm freshman year.

42:25.942 --> 42:31.378
That's right, I'm talking about
pounding the punanny pavement,

42:31.380 --> 42:32.981
rolling the jelly doughnut,

42:32.983 --> 42:34.782
cleaning the pipes.

42:38.021 --> 42:40.588
Ah! Ah!

42:40.590 --> 42:43.925
Freddy from the block
just got laid.

42:49.766 --> 42:53.534
Damn, that witch sure cast

42:53.536 --> 42:57.472
a wicked hump spell,
you know what I'm saying?

42:57.474 --> 42:58.873
Oh, look, there she is...

46:04.893 --> 46:08.795
Something happened to Freddy.

46:08.797 --> 46:11.932
Come on!

46:11.934 --> 46:13.570
Yes.

46:23.713 --> 46:24.981
Why'd the music stop?

46:37.860 --> 46:41.061
Okay.

46:43.498 --> 46:44.734
Um...

46:50.940 --> 46:53.773
Well, clearly
he's not here now.

46:53.775 --> 46:56.443
Maybe he was
pulling a prank.

46:56.445 --> 46:58.445
You know how he is.

46:58.447 --> 47:01.983
Maybe he's waiting
upstairs for us.

47:01.985 --> 47:03.617
Or maybe...

47:03.619 --> 47:06.787
Tara's shrooms
are still going strong.

47:06.789 --> 47:09.356
True that, man.

47:10.960 --> 47:13.661
Knowing Freddy,
he probably went off

47:13.663 --> 47:16.030
to shoot some B roll
for his vlog shit.

47:16.032 --> 47:17.498
I don't know.

47:17.500 --> 47:20.034
He's a big boy who's done a ton
of shrooms in his time.

47:20.036 --> 47:23.840
But I'm sure he's fine, okay?

47:25.775 --> 47:28.211
Baby, come on.

49:46.481 --> 49:49.686
Damn, we fucked this place up.

50:29.291 --> 50:32.028
Mmm.

50:34.963 --> 50:36.996
Grace, what the hell?

50:36.998 --> 50:39.066
I just wanted
to greet the morning.

50:39.068 --> 50:40.967
Let you see what life
could be like

50:40.969 --> 50:44.137
with someone who can actually
hear those moans of pleasure.

50:44.139 --> 50:46.773
Grace, that's a really bitch
thing to say.

50:46.775 --> 50:50.047
What do I care?
She can't hear it.

50:53.648 --> 50:55.483
No.

50:55.485 --> 50:57.450
Tara.

50:57.452 --> 51:01.287
Fuck you, Grace. God.

51:35.324 --> 51:37.858
Tara.

51:37.860 --> 51:40.394
I am so sorry.

51:40.396 --> 51:44.498
I was just joking
with Josh.

51:44.500 --> 51:45.932
It didn't mean a thing.

51:45.934 --> 51:49.135
What didn't?

51:49.137 --> 51:50.637
Look who's finally awake?

51:50.639 --> 51:52.505
Don't change
the subject, Grace.

51:52.507 --> 51:54.441
- What didn't mean a thing?
- My fucking Josh.

51:54.443 --> 51:56.043
What the fuck?
You fucked my girl?

51:56.045 --> 51:57.478
Get your fucking hands
off me.

51:57.480 --> 51:58.845
What the fuck?
Is it true?

51:58.847 --> 52:00.414
Of course not, idiot!

52:00.416 --> 52:02.115
The two of you fighting
over little old me.

52:02.117 --> 52:04.552
I can't tell you
how flattered I am, really.

52:04.554 --> 52:05.686
Did you fuck him?

52:05.688 --> 52:08.488
No, you fucking oaf.

52:08.490 --> 52:10.057
I didn't.

52:10.059 --> 52:12.927
I should've because
you're built like a Ken doll.

52:12.929 --> 52:14.394
I didn't even
get wet last night.

52:14.396 --> 52:16.796
Dry like the Sahara
down there.

52:16.798 --> 52:17.898
Don't talk like that.

52:17.900 --> 52:19.465
Grace.

52:19.467 --> 52:20.900
You keep out
of this, Erin,

52:20.902 --> 52:22.101
or I'll lock you
in the basement.

52:22.103 --> 52:23.304
Stop it, Grace.

52:23.306 --> 52:26.206
Make me, dummy.

52:26.208 --> 52:28.943
Make me, inchworm.

52:28.945 --> 52:31.347
Enough.

53:18.094 --> 53:20.961
Aah!

53:26.601 --> 53:28.334
Ooh, what the fuck?

53:28.336 --> 53:30.938
What are you doing?
Oh, what are you doing?

53:30.940 --> 53:34.407
Oh, my God!
Holy shit!

53:37.813 --> 53:40.514
Grace!

53:46.489 --> 53:48.889
- Grace!
- What the fuck?

54:13.181 --> 54:14.581
What the fuck was that?

54:15.717 --> 54:17.617
What the fuck?

54:19.755 --> 54:21.889
Ah!

54:36.871 --> 54:39.440
It's tight.

54:39.442 --> 54:42.242
Okay, so what's next?

54:42.244 --> 54:45.012
We get ghost,
like, right now.

54:45.014 --> 54:47.246
We just leave her here...
like this?

54:47.248 --> 54:48.648
Fuck, yeah!

54:48.650 --> 54:50.650
Kimbo, Freddy...

54:50.652 --> 54:51.918
We need to find them.

54:51.920 --> 54:53.487
What's she saying?

54:53.489 --> 54:55.521
We need to find
Kimberly and Freddy.

54:55.523 --> 54:57.791
Fuck 'em! For all
we know, they're dead already.

54:57.793 --> 54:59.592
You guys heard that scream.

54:59.594 --> 55:02.429
Look, I say we go,

55:02.431 --> 55:04.331
and then we get the cops
to come up here,

55:04.333 --> 55:07.333
find them, and put fucking
Grace in the psycho ward.

55:07.335 --> 55:10.604
Oh, it's nice to know
you have our back, asshole.

55:10.606 --> 55:12.639
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you back, bitch!

55:12.641 --> 55:16.876
- What? What?
- Brandon? Brandon?

55:16.878 --> 55:18.811
You know she is not crazy.

55:18.813 --> 55:20.581
She's possessed.

55:20.583 --> 55:22.983
I don't care
what she is.

55:22.985 --> 55:24.517
We need to try
to bring her back.

55:24.519 --> 55:27.621
And how do you propose
we do that?

55:27.623 --> 55:29.990
What the fuck
is she saying?

55:29.992 --> 55:31.325
There's a spell
in the book

55:31.327 --> 55:33.260
There's a banishing spell
in the book.

55:33.262 --> 55:34.695
Are you freaking
kidding me?

55:34.697 --> 55:36.262
Doing that witch stuff
is what got us

55:36.264 --> 55:37.965
in this fuckhole
in the first place.

55:37.967 --> 55:40.833
So we're not doing anymore
of that shit, you hear me?

55:40.835 --> 55:42.735
We're leaving,
like, yesterday.

55:42.737 --> 55:44.771
Brandon,
we need to stay together.

55:44.773 --> 55:48.744
You stay. I'm gone.
Who's with me?

55:51.012 --> 55:53.546
We're staying
to help Grace.

55:53.548 --> 55:55.416
You guys are idiots.

55:55.418 --> 55:59.021
Thanks... for a great
fucking weekend.

56:32.922 --> 56:34.787
What the fuck?

56:34.789 --> 56:37.559
Fucker.

56:51.373 --> 56:53.039
Ah, which one is it?

56:53.041 --> 56:55.075
I don't know.

56:55.077 --> 56:57.311
No, this is the spell

56:57.313 --> 56:59.246
to reverse the circle
of protection.

56:59.248 --> 57:03.249
Ordinances, locked doors,
barriers...

57:03.251 --> 57:04.851
Got it! Demon exile.

57:04.853 --> 57:07.820
Uh, okay, uh, the demon
should be present

57:07.822 --> 57:10.123
in the ritual symbol
before incantation.

57:10.125 --> 57:11.891
She is. Let's do this.

57:11.893 --> 57:14.994
Okay. Here goes.

57:16.398 --> 57:20.434
<i>Rursus sub terris
omnia daemonia</i>

57:20.436 --> 57:22.603
<i>a gratia Spiritus.</i>

57:22.605 --> 57:26.775
<i>O Pater virtutes convertere
ad animarus...</i>

57:28.878 --> 57:30.409
No, I didn't.

57:30.411 --> 57:32.579
No, I didn't!

57:32.581 --> 57:34.847
Read it again,
read it again.

57:36.284 --> 57:38.353
Fine.

57:39.487 --> 57:43.824
Rursus sub terris
omnia daemonia

57:43.826 --> 57:46.325
<i>a gratia Spiritus.</i>

57:46.327 --> 57:47.327
<i>O Pater...</i>

57:49.398 --> 57:50.796
Come on, read the spell!
Read the spell!

57:50.798 --> 57:52.900
<i>Rursus sub terris...</i>

57:57.206 --> 58:00.139
Go, run!

58:00.141 --> 58:02.309
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

58:02.311 --> 58:03.744
Oh, my God!

58:05.380 --> 58:07.382
She's coming!

58:12.655 --> 58:15.155
Lock it! Lock it!
It can't open locked doors!

58:16.659 --> 58:19.860
- Come on, Toby!
- Toby, lock it.

58:25.568 --> 58:27.770
Aah!

58:38.880 --> 58:40.849
Aah!

58:43.552 --> 58:46.186
Oh!

58:48.023 --> 58:49.925
Damn it.

58:56.364 --> 59:00.333
Oh, you got to be
kidding me.

59:34.769 --> 59:35.635
Fuck.

59:35.637 --> 59:38.738
This is so fucked up.

01:00:08.804 --> 01:00:10.804
Oh.

01:00:16.277 --> 01:00:19.445
Oh! Oh, God damn it!

01:00:22.384 --> 01:00:24.150
Freddy?

01:00:24.152 --> 01:00:26.920
You're alive.

01:00:33.061 --> 01:00:35.095
Freddy?

01:01:18.673 --> 01:01:21.708
I think
I met Kimberly

01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:24.878
back in second grade.

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:26.512
Yeah.

01:01:26.514 --> 01:01:31.351
She didn't like me
then, though.

01:01:31.353 --> 01:01:35.521
Fucking snot-nosed brat,
flicking her ear

01:01:35.523 --> 01:01:37.759
every, like, two secs.

01:01:39.161 --> 01:01:43.195
Well, that was the way
I showed the love.

01:01:43.197 --> 01:01:44.865
You know?

01:01:44.867 --> 01:01:49.202
Just annoy them
till they notice me.

01:01:54.710 --> 01:01:58.077
She just ignored me,
though.

01:02:00.548 --> 01:02:02.215
She was smart.

01:02:02.217 --> 01:02:04.517
I never knew that.

01:02:07.889 --> 01:02:11.724
As soon as I stopped,

01:02:11.726 --> 01:02:14.561
out of sheer boredom,

01:02:14.563 --> 01:02:17.563
that's when
we became friends.

01:02:17.565 --> 01:02:19.566
Now she's gone.

01:02:19.568 --> 01:02:21.834
Freddy's gone.

01:02:21.836 --> 01:02:23.103
Brandon.

01:02:23.105 --> 01:02:25.539
What about Grace?

01:02:32.181 --> 01:02:35.016
Is she gone?

01:02:36.418 --> 01:02:38.351
No.

01:02:38.353 --> 01:02:42.188
She is still in there
somewhere.

01:02:42.190 --> 01:02:45.691
We just need to find a way
to bring her back.

01:02:45.693 --> 01:02:47.561
But how?

01:02:47.563 --> 01:02:51.664
We get her
into the triangle...

01:02:51.666 --> 01:02:52.898
Yeah, we saw how
that worked out.

01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.767
Okay, it will work

01:02:54.769 --> 01:02:56.769
if we just knock her out
for longer.

01:02:56.771 --> 01:02:58.405
And how do you suggest
we do that?

01:02:58.407 --> 01:02:59.675
I don't know!

01:03:10.251 --> 01:03:12.751
Whoa, Tara, hold up.

01:03:12.753 --> 01:03:14.757
Yo, I got my shit organized.

01:03:16.724 --> 01:03:18.791
Yeah. I-I got plenty.

01:03:18.793 --> 01:03:21.661
I got... I got A-Ambien.
I got Lunesta.

01:03:21.663 --> 01:03:23.463
I got Rozerem, Zolpidem.

01:03:23.465 --> 01:03:26.202
Genius.

01:03:27.536 --> 01:03:29.269
Can you liquefy it?

01:03:29.271 --> 01:03:32.675
Yeah. Dude, you... you can
pretty much liquefy anything.

01:03:35.577 --> 01:03:37.644
Oh, this?

01:03:37.646 --> 01:03:40.246
This will put an elephant
to sleep.

01:03:40.248 --> 01:03:41.715
How long?

01:03:43.652 --> 01:03:45.619
Last time I tried it,

01:03:45.621 --> 01:03:49.322
I showed up
to my Friday night gig.

01:03:49.324 --> 01:03:51.324
It was Saturday night.

01:03:51.326 --> 01:03:53.025
But will that kill her?

01:03:53.027 --> 01:03:57.296
Yo, I can't account for
any pre-existing conditions,

01:03:57.298 --> 01:03:59.499
like heart palpitations

01:03:59.501 --> 01:04:01.668
or coronary disease

01:04:01.670 --> 01:04:03.670
of if she's
on any blood thinners,

01:04:03.672 --> 01:04:05.972
like Coumadin or Clexane
or Cutenox!

01:04:05.974 --> 01:04:07.072
Toby!

01:04:07.074 --> 01:04:10.844
If her shit's clean,
yeah...

01:04:10.846 --> 01:04:13.112
she's gonna sleep like a baby.

01:04:13.114 --> 01:04:14.748
Toby...

01:04:17.052 --> 01:04:18.217
Get it done.

01:04:24.092 --> 01:04:25.758
Wait,
where are you going?

01:04:27.862 --> 01:04:29.862
We need a backup plan.

01:04:39.708 --> 01:04:41.206
What are you doing?

01:04:41.208 --> 01:04:44.244
What do you think I'm doing?
We have to be prepared.

01:04:46.949 --> 01:04:48.248
No.

01:04:50.251 --> 01:04:53.887
No. That is not an option.

01:04:53.889 --> 01:04:56.121
We're not killing her.
That is still Grace in there.

01:04:56.123 --> 01:04:58.724
What the hell is wrong
with you, Erin, huh?

01:05:04.032 --> 01:05:07.200
If she's standing over you
or Toby or Tara,

01:05:07.202 --> 01:05:08.735
you better believe
one of those rifles in there

01:05:08.737 --> 01:05:10.470
is the only thing,

01:05:10.472 --> 01:05:13.740
the only thing standing
between you living and dying.

01:05:15.911 --> 01:05:18.278
I will take that shot
if I have to.

01:05:45.539 --> 01:05:46.840
Grace would fight for us

01:05:46.842 --> 01:05:49.608
if it were the
other way around.

01:05:49.610 --> 01:05:52.045
Killing her is not an option.

01:05:52.047 --> 01:05:54.380
I'm not Grace.

01:06:34.623 --> 01:06:36.990
Toby!

01:06:36.992 --> 01:06:39.892
Toby! Toby, open the door!

01:06:39.894 --> 01:06:41.827
Kimberly?

01:06:41.829 --> 01:06:43.595
- Kimberly?
- Toby, help!

01:06:43.597 --> 01:06:45.831
Thank you.

01:06:45.833 --> 01:06:48.735
Oh, shit.

01:06:48.737 --> 01:06:50.269
Ah!

01:06:50.271 --> 01:06:52.805
Run, Tara! Run!

01:06:53.942 --> 01:06:58.445
Tara!

01:07:05.152 --> 01:07:09.255
Run, Tara!

01:07:41.922 --> 01:07:43.889
Erin, take the shot!

01:07:43.891 --> 01:07:45.358
Take the shot!

01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:48.728
- I can't.

01:07:48.730 --> 01:07:50.063
I can't!

01:08:17.759 --> 01:08:19.759
Are you okay?

01:08:26.466 --> 01:08:27.599
Alive?

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:28.835
Um...

01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:34.773
Hey, hey.

01:08:34.774 --> 01:08:36.776
It's not your fault.

01:08:42.716 --> 01:08:44.786
This ends now.

01:08:49.689 --> 01:08:51.523
Josh, please.

01:08:51.524 --> 01:08:53.692
This is not a debate, Er.

01:08:53.694 --> 01:08:55.761
This is survival.

01:08:55.764 --> 01:08:56.995
You think I came
to this fucking place

01:08:56.997 --> 01:08:58.497
expecting to kill
our friends?

01:09:02.871 --> 01:09:05.807
I'm going down there alone.

01:09:07.408 --> 01:09:10.442
I have to do this!

01:09:10.444 --> 01:09:12.411
No, no, no, Josh.
You can't do that.

01:09:12.412 --> 01:09:13.912
We don't know
what's wrong with her.

01:09:13.913 --> 01:09:15.415
We don't know how
to stop it.

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:17.116
I don't even know
what's wrong with her,

01:09:17.118 --> 01:09:18.617
but she's too dangerous,
and she's too powerful.

01:09:18.618 --> 01:09:20.352
- Erin. Erin!
- You can't go down there.

01:09:20.354 --> 01:09:22.054
You can't just leave her
up here alone...

01:09:22.055 --> 01:09:25.560
Erin. I need you
to close and lock the door.

01:09:27.028 --> 01:09:29.428
Can you do that for me?

01:09:29.430 --> 01:09:32.365
You need to be strong.

01:09:32.367 --> 01:09:35.069
I can't do this
without you, sis.

01:09:53.188 --> 01:09:56.188
Don't worry about me.

01:09:56.190 --> 01:09:59.094
I'm more worried
about Grace getting out.

01:10:33.228 --> 01:10:34.960
I need you both to hide.

01:10:34.962 --> 01:10:37.597
Stick together.

01:10:37.599 --> 01:10:39.568
Understand?

01:11:07.595 --> 01:11:10.966
No. No!

01:11:17.104 --> 01:11:20.009
We have to hide.

01:11:59.847 --> 01:12:01.947
What is it?

01:12:34.015 --> 01:12:36.315
Yoo-hoo!

01:12:36.317 --> 01:12:38.487
Ladies!

01:13:38.212 --> 01:13:40.646
Ugh!

01:13:40.648 --> 01:13:42.113
No! Ugh! Ugh!

01:13:44.085 --> 01:13:46.885
Ugh! Aah!

01:13:51.626 --> 01:13:53.291
Aah!

01:14:35.537 --> 01:14:36.968
Sorry.

01:14:39.140 --> 01:14:41.109
Oh, don't be so surprised.

01:14:42.877 --> 01:14:47.446
I'm talking to you.

01:14:47.448 --> 01:14:51.450
Don't be so surprised.

01:14:51.452 --> 01:14:54.553
She did it for love.

01:14:55.890 --> 01:14:59.692
She thinks she sacrificed
all of you for love.

01:15:04.698 --> 01:15:07.333
No, wait, wait!
Don't take her! Don't take her!

01:15:07.335 --> 01:15:09.669
We need her.
I need her.

01:15:09.671 --> 01:15:12.071
Since when is this about you?

01:15:12.073 --> 01:15:13.940
Since we made a deal.

01:15:35.063 --> 01:15:37.028
Boom, bitches.

01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:38.930
- To Pop Pop.
- To Pop Pop!

01:15:46.541 --> 01:15:48.773
Uh, guys?

01:15:48.775 --> 01:15:51.744
This is ridiculous.
We have to jump on this.

01:15:52.947 --> 01:15:55.013
- Why don't you do it?
- Hmm?

01:16:05.859 --> 01:16:10.830
<i>...contra rem publicam
vobis nuntiatum sit?</i>

01:16:10.832 --> 01:16:11.897
<i>O praeclarum...</i>

01:16:11.899 --> 01:16:14.066
Ahh...

01:16:22.076 --> 01:16:24.477
No!

01:16:26.014 --> 01:16:28.013
No...

01:16:34.555 --> 01:16:38.891
I did everything you asked.
Everything.

01:16:38.893 --> 01:16:41.360
But you made one
mistake.

01:16:42.430 --> 01:16:44.597
<i>Coram populo,</i>

01:16:44.599 --> 01:16:47.266
<i>Legum servi sumus
ut liberi esse possimus...</i>

01:16:47.268 --> 01:16:48.534
What are you doing?

01:16:50.704 --> 01:16:52.772
Didn't you?

01:16:52.774 --> 01:16:54.740
How was I supposed to know
Brandon would chicken-shit out?

01:16:54.742 --> 01:16:57.476
I don't want
to do this anymore.

01:16:57.478 --> 01:16:59.945
- And then Grace?
- Ah, yes.

01:16:59.947 --> 01:17:01.213
Grace.

01:17:02.949 --> 01:17:05.951
You so want her.

01:17:09.023 --> 01:17:12.191
So close, you can just...

01:17:12.193 --> 01:17:14.660
taste it.

01:18:02.643 --> 01:18:04.576
<i>You ever wonder why?</i>

01:18:07.247 --> 01:18:09.115
Grace.

01:18:10.618 --> 01:18:14.285
<i>Why you love her so much?</i>

01:18:34.475 --> 01:18:37.112
She's mine.

01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:43.382
But you can leap
into Tara.

01:18:43.384 --> 01:18:45.453
Right?

01:18:46.820 --> 01:18:50.923
See, it's just
a simple possession transfer.

01:18:50.925 --> 01:18:53.325
I know your history.
You have done it before.

01:18:53.327 --> 01:18:55.093
Gather the bodies.

01:19:13.747 --> 01:19:17.118
Read the summoning spell.

01:19:18.586 --> 01:19:21.152
But first you need
to transfer into Tara.

01:19:21.154 --> 01:19:22.754
A body that can't hear.

01:19:22.756 --> 01:19:24.022
What's the fun in that?

01:19:24.024 --> 01:19:27.995
- But you...
- Read the spell.

01:19:33.067 --> 01:19:34.967
No.

01:19:38.271 --> 01:19:40.772
Give me Grace,

01:19:40.774 --> 01:19:43.675
or I am not reading
the spell.

01:19:43.677 --> 01:19:45.376
And none of your legion

01:19:45.378 --> 01:19:49.214
gets to come over
to this plane.

01:19:49.216 --> 01:19:51.016
We both know only someone
of this Earth

01:19:51.018 --> 01:19:53.919
can read the sacred language
of the spells.

01:19:53.921 --> 01:19:58.123
No canceling
the circle of protection.

01:19:58.125 --> 01:20:00.392
No summoning spell.

01:20:00.394 --> 01:20:02.894
You'll be trapped
in this little bubble forever.

01:20:02.896 --> 01:20:05.598
Now, where's the fun
in that?

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:08.267
Are you actually
threatening me?

01:20:09.837 --> 01:20:11.536
I just want what's mine.

01:20:11.538 --> 01:20:15.074
Stupid human.

01:20:15.076 --> 01:20:18.443
I don't need you
to read the spell.

01:20:18.445 --> 01:20:21.983
I just need someone.

01:20:24.719 --> 01:20:26.451
Be grateful I let you live.

01:20:26.453 --> 01:20:30.759
Ah!

01:20:34.228 --> 01:20:37.097
Read the spell!

01:20:42.502 --> 01:20:45.504
I'm sorry.

01:20:55.216 --> 01:20:58.217
Come.
This should be good.

01:21:40.493 --> 01:21:42.727
Now, now, Erin,

01:21:42.729 --> 01:21:46.999
old barns are hardly
a safe haven.

01:22:03.216 --> 01:22:04.782
Found you.

01:22:27.173 --> 01:22:28.507
Aah!

01:22:28.509 --> 01:22:30.009
Stay away from me!

01:22:32.512 --> 01:22:34.847
Aah! Aah!

01:22:36.417 --> 01:22:38.650
Stay away from me!

01:23:03.043 --> 01:23:05.643
Shh!

01:23:05.645 --> 01:23:08.714
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:23:08.716 --> 01:23:11.717
Aah!

01:23:36.777 --> 01:23:39.178
Find the deaf one.

01:23:45.019 --> 01:23:47.052
Help!

01:23:47.054 --> 01:23:49.521
Help! No!

01:23:49.523 --> 01:23:52.691
No! Help! Help!

01:24:19.787 --> 01:24:21.553
Ah!

01:24:23.189 --> 01:24:25.824
Aah!

01:24:34.068 --> 01:24:35.534
We need her.

01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:51.916
Oh, you little fool.

01:24:51.918 --> 01:24:53.919
The banishment spell
won't work.

01:24:53.921 --> 01:24:56.120
We're not in the triangle.

01:24:56.122 --> 01:25:00.726
Yes... you... are!

01:25:09.470 --> 01:25:10.936
- Yeah.
- That's sick.

01:25:10.938 --> 01:25:13.104
Yo, I want a photographic
memory, T.

01:25:13.106 --> 01:25:14.908
<i>Can you teach me?</i>

01:25:16.844 --> 01:25:18.576
Yeah, there's
a fourth spell.

01:25:18.578 --> 01:25:22.046
<i>It sends all conjured demons
within the ritual symbol</i>

01:25:22.048 --> 01:25:24.482
<i>back from whence they came.</i>

01:25:46.073 --> 01:25:49.174
Okay, the demon
should be present

01:25:49.176 --> 01:25:51.043
in the ritual symbol
before incantation.

01:25:51.045 --> 01:25:53.378
She is. She is.

01:27:17.597 --> 01:27:19.897
Ugh. Ugh.

01:27:39.386 --> 01:27:42.553
Oh...

01:27:56.804 --> 01:27:59.407
Where's Erin?

01:28:24.465 --> 01:28:27.568
I don't know
what to say.

01:28:29.136 --> 01:28:31.870
I don't think
we need to say anything.

01:28:40.314 --> 01:28:42.513
No one needs to know
what happened here.

01:29:13.846 --> 01:29:18.450
<i>...sicut praeceperat
Dominus voluerit...</i>

01:29:18.452 --> 01:29:22.553
<i>Et hoc nunc locat recedemus.</i>

01:29:59.193 --> 01:30:01.226
Babe, are you okay?

01:30:04.997 --> 01:30:07.067
Yeah.

01:30:08.534 --> 01:30:10.869
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:30:10.871 --> 01:30:12.771
Let's get out of here.
