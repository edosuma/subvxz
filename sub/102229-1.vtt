00:00.875 --> 00:02.450
(dramatic music)

00:02.450 --> 00:04.083
- [Man] You hate breakfast.

00:06.090 --> 00:08.019
It's one of the worst things about you.

00:08.019 --> 00:10.063
- [Taxi] Do you want to take
the bridge or the tunnel?

00:11.010 --> 00:12.310
- [Man] It doesn't matter.

00:16.170 --> 00:17.740
- Tunnel's quicker.

00:17.740 --> 00:19.400
- [Man] Well, then take the tunnel.

00:19.400 --> 00:20.233
- Are you sure?

00:22.500 --> 00:23.333
- Sure about what?

00:23.333 --> 00:25.153
- [Taxi] There's a toll on the tunnel.

00:26.030 --> 00:27.900
- I feel like you should probably take

00:27.900 --> 00:30.013
whichever one you feel is best.

00:32.510 --> 00:33.570
- We'll take whatever's cheapest.

00:33.570 --> 00:35.245
We're not in a hurry.

00:35.245 --> 00:36.250
- But we are in a hurry.

00:36.250 --> 00:38.929
- We're not in a hurry.

00:38.929 --> 00:41.512
(gentle music)

00:44.100 --> 00:46.640
- [Taxi] Highway looks
to be pretty jammed.

00:46.640 --> 00:49.870
- Is there an alternative
to taking the highway?

00:49.870 --> 00:51.100
- [Taxi] Local roads.

00:51.100 --> 00:52.056
- Right.

00:52.056 --> 00:54.889
- Yeah, I don't think we should
be taking the local roads.

00:54.889 --> 00:56.926
- I don't think we should this much

00:56.926 --> 00:59.692
of a conversation with the cab driver.

00:59.692 --> 01:02.275
(gentle music)

01:17.054 --> 01:19.804
(dramatic music)

02:54.980 --> 02:58.440
- Your first day back in town
and you call me for this?

02:58.440 --> 02:59.273
- Can you get it?

02:59.273 --> 03:00.656
- Yeah, I got it.

03:00.656 --> 03:03.623
All right, all right, oh my God.

03:03.623 --> 03:04.540
Up, up, up.

03:05.575 --> 03:06.408
Oh my God.

03:07.650 --> 03:08.860
- Fuck.

03:08.860 --> 03:09.863
Oh, be careful.

03:12.095 --> 03:13.713
Jesus Christ.

03:16.972 --> 03:18.811
God.

03:18.811 --> 03:19.644
Fuck.

03:19.644 --> 03:20.477
- I'm gonna hurl.

03:20.477 --> 03:21.310
- Damn it.

03:23.292 --> 03:25.485
(men grunting)

03:25.485 --> 03:27.620
(glass shatters)

03:27.620 --> 03:29.693
Okay, watch your feet.

03:30.670 --> 03:33.070
Picture broke, there's
glass all over your feet.

03:37.288 --> 03:39.170
You know that scene in mission impossible

03:39.170 --> 03:40.490
where he breaks the light bulbs

03:40.490 --> 03:42.640
so he can hear people
coming up the stairs?

03:44.590 --> 03:46.135
Well this reminds me of that.

03:46.135 --> 03:47.650
All right.

03:47.650 --> 03:48.483
Come on.

03:50.113 --> 03:50.946
- It's a good scene.

03:50.946 --> 03:53.529
(men grunting)

03:55.377 --> 03:57.294
- All right, just wait.

03:59.133 --> 04:01.183
- [Man] So what happened to Lizzy anyway?

04:02.530 --> 04:03.393
- She disappeared.

04:03.393 --> 04:05.040
- What do you mean she disappeared?

04:05.040 --> 04:08.387
She disappeared, disappeared,
or Lizzy disappeared?

04:08.387 --> 04:09.690
- Well I don't mean she disappeared

04:09.690 --> 04:12.160
like she's on the side of a milk carton.

04:12.160 --> 04:14.140
She's just took off, she's gone.

04:14.140 --> 04:15.490
We're not together anymore.

04:17.140 --> 04:18.490
- [Man] Sorry to hear that.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.300
- [Man] Come on, let's go.

04:28.320 --> 04:29.153
Ready?

04:29.153 --> 04:29.986
- Yeah, I guess.

04:29.986 --> 04:32.021
- [Man] One, two, three.

04:32.021 --> 04:34.492
(men grunting)

04:34.492 --> 04:36.650
Hold on, fuck, hold on.

04:36.650 --> 04:37.970
- Oh shit.

04:37.970 --> 04:38.803
- [Man] What?

04:38.803 --> 04:39.725
- I think I broke the step.

04:39.725 --> 04:41.729
(dramatic music)

04:41.729 --> 04:44.229
(door creaks)

04:45.568 --> 04:47.235
- Holy fucking shit.

04:49.489 --> 04:50.705
- What's goin on man?

04:50.705 --> 04:52.210
- Oh man.

04:52.210 --> 04:53.500
Back from the dead.

04:53.500 --> 04:54.455
- You're looking good.

04:54.455 --> 04:55.288
- Oh, you know, I try.

04:55.288 --> 04:57.510
- Still bringing in the crowds I see.

04:57.510 --> 04:59.090
- You set him up?

04:59.090 --> 05:00.740
- You know it.

05:00.740 --> 05:02.040
He's picking up Brunches for us.

05:02.040 --> 05:02.957
- No shit?

05:02.957 --> 05:03.790
- Yeah.

05:03.790 --> 05:04.623
- What kind of music you gonna play?

05:04.623 --> 05:05.456
- I have no idea.

05:06.290 --> 05:08.510
I do appreciate the gig.

05:08.510 --> 05:09.410
- No problem.

05:09.410 --> 05:10.243
- [Bartender] Cheers, welcome back.

05:10.243 --> 05:11.833
- We're literally,
always hiring for Brunch.

05:15.234 --> 05:17.313
- By the way, you staying
at that place over there?

05:19.119 --> 05:20.220
Good for you, I bet your glad you didn't

05:20.220 --> 05:22.480
sell that place as a
fucking lottery ticket.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.490
- You should see the
futon he's just put in.

05:24.490 --> 05:25.410
It's gorgeous.

05:25.410 --> 05:27.003
- Come on, let's do another round.

05:28.840 --> 05:29.950
What, I haven't seen you guys in years,

05:29.950 --> 05:31.840
we can't do hammer times back
to back to back about it?

05:31.840 --> 05:32.852
Come on.

05:32.852 --> 05:33.685
- Ah fuck it, all right,
all right, all right.

05:33.685 --> 05:34.860
I'm no bitch, let's do it.

05:36.631 --> 05:38.631
- I haven't done back to backs in years.

05:41.989 --> 05:44.676
(gentle music)

05:44.676 --> 05:47.464
- [Man] I can't go fucking
drinking like this.

05:47.464 --> 05:49.090
You're a fucking bitch.

05:49.090 --> 05:50.956
And you just a kid, you know that right?

05:50.956 --> 05:51.789
- Oh fuck.

05:54.664 --> 05:56.289
- [Man] I actually know these things!

05:56.289 --> 05:57.791
- I know fucking more
than you'll ever know,

05:57.791 --> 05:59.282
you don't get to play the smart card

05:59.282 --> 06:01.397
just cause you're older than me, asshole.

06:01.397 --> 06:02.708
I don't have fucking time for this shit,

06:02.708 --> 06:04.040
I have better shit to think about.

06:04.040 --> 06:05.211
- [Man] Yeah, like what?

06:05.211 --> 06:06.091
- [Woman] Like, like.

06:06.091 --> 06:07.680
- [Man] Like what, what better

06:07.680 --> 06:09.390
shit do you have to think about?

06:09.390 --> 06:11.400
- [Woman] High minded
shit, I don't fucking know.

06:11.400 --> 06:12.680
Euthanasia, women's rights.

06:12.680 --> 06:14.263
- Listen to yourself, the other night

06:14.263 --> 06:15.790
when we were talking politics you thought

06:15.790 --> 06:18.400
I said that you run
Cointreau, like it's something

06:18.400 --> 06:20.163
you put in a fucking margarita.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.583
(gentle music)

06:28.780 --> 06:29.830
All yours Clark Kent!

06:33.557 --> 06:34.390
- Are you okay?

06:36.830 --> 06:37.663
- Yeah fine.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.400
- What was that all about?

06:47.560 --> 06:52.030
- I fucked him too good.

06:52.030 --> 06:54.720
- Yeah, I hate it when I do that.

06:59.706 --> 07:00.830
Come on, let's do a shot.

07:00.830 --> 07:02.020
- [Woman] Nah, I don't really do shots.

07:02.020 --> 07:04.860
- [Man] What, just do one shot.

07:04.860 --> 07:06.660
- [Woman] Fine, only if it's vodka though.

07:06.660 --> 07:09.010
- [Man] Yeah, we're not
drinking vodka, whisky.

07:10.560 --> 07:11.403
- Oh shit.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.225
We should go do something fun right now.

07:14.225 --> 07:15.689
Everyone just drinks in this city,

07:15.689 --> 07:17.107
but it's a big city you know?

07:17.107 --> 07:18.760
We should go do something.

07:18.760 --> 07:20.040
- Like what?

07:20.040 --> 07:22.360
Go look at the statue of Liberty?

07:22.360 --> 07:23.710
There's nothing to do here.

07:24.547 --> 07:26.800
And it's 6:00 AM.

07:26.800 --> 07:27.805
- So?

07:27.805 --> 07:30.388
(gentle music)

07:31.388 --> 07:34.950
(gentle music)
(waves crashing)

07:34.950 --> 07:37.260
- That's a pretty cool statue.

07:37.260 --> 07:40.760
I mean, aside from the historical
part, it's pretty neat.

07:40.760 --> 07:42.040
I wish something like that,

07:42.040 --> 07:45.093
some big statement were made just for me.

07:46.050 --> 07:47.650
Like the Taj Mahal or something.

07:49.145 --> 07:50.228
I don't know.

07:52.525 --> 07:53.575
You know what I mean?

07:57.072 --> 07:59.850
- You ever hear of a thing
called the Cardiff giant?

07:59.850 --> 08:00.683
- No.

08:02.210 --> 08:04.900
- It's this famous thing
in upstate New York,

08:04.900 --> 08:08.230
this guy made a fake skeleton of a giant

08:08.230 --> 08:10.403
and then charged people
admission to look at it.

08:11.480 --> 08:13.920
Somehow this thing swept the nation.

08:13.920 --> 08:16.823
People were coming in covered
wagons just to see it.

08:18.370 --> 08:21.940
He made so much money that PT. Barnum

08:21.940 --> 08:23.946
made a replica of the fake skeleton,

08:23.946 --> 08:26.520
charged admission to look at that,

08:26.520 --> 08:28.190
huge lawsuit for infringement

08:28.190 --> 08:29.760
which Barnum ended up winning

08:29.760 --> 08:33.540
because it turns out
you can't make a forgery

08:33.540 --> 08:35.190
of something that's already fake.

08:38.740 --> 08:41.023
I think about that whenever
I look at stuff like this.

08:43.849 --> 08:46.790
The Statue of Liberty doesn't
make me feel anything.

08:46.790 --> 08:49.083
It's just a giant lady holding a torch.

08:54.450 --> 08:55.450
- I kind of like it.

09:01.090 --> 09:03.320
- Hey, can you please take your shoes off?

09:03.320 --> 09:06.250
No matter how ridiculous they are.

09:06.250 --> 09:07.700
- [Woman] I love these shoes.

09:10.640 --> 09:11.830
- [Man] You want a drink?

09:11.830 --> 09:12.945
- Mmhm.

09:12.945 --> 09:15.528
(gentle music)

09:27.950 --> 09:28.950
You play the guitar?

09:32.220 --> 09:33.053
- I used to.

09:34.090 --> 09:35.040
- [Woman] You good?

09:36.950 --> 09:38.153
- No, not really.

09:39.610 --> 09:43.260
I just rip off Leonard Cohen and Tom Waits

09:43.260 --> 09:45.830
- Leonard Cohen wrote that
Jeff Buckley song, right?

09:45.830 --> 09:48.130
- Just please don't ever
say that to me again.

09:52.255 --> 09:54.490
(woman gags)

09:54.490 --> 09:57.273
Have you ever even seen
anybody do a shot before?

09:58.170 --> 09:59.830
- I haven't seen any of these.

09:59.830 --> 10:01.310
- Really?

10:01.310 --> 10:02.786
Not even metropolitan?

10:02.786 --> 10:03.710
- Don't do that thing.

10:03.710 --> 10:04.860
Don't act like it's Citizen Kane,

10:04.860 --> 10:05.960
just cause I haven't seen it yet.

10:05.960 --> 10:08.260
- [Man] I didn't act
like it was Citizen Kane.

10:09.770 --> 10:11.320
Have you heard of any of those?

10:12.230 --> 10:13.630
- Did you just move here?

10:13.630 --> 10:14.820
- [Man] To New York?

10:14.820 --> 10:18.610
No, I just moved back.

10:18.610 --> 10:19.829
- The old come and go.

10:19.829 --> 10:22.950
- No, I never wanted to
leave in the first place.

10:22.950 --> 10:24.740
I lived here for 10 years.

10:24.740 --> 10:26.370
- [Woman] Does that really mean eight?

10:26.370 --> 10:28.250
Everyone always rounds up.

10:28.250 --> 10:29.083
- How old are you?

10:29.083 --> 10:31.207
- [Woman] 19 and three quarters.

10:31.207 --> 10:32.200
I don't know why I said that.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.520
I don't usually do that.

10:33.520 --> 10:35.265
I'm 19, almost 19.

10:35.265 --> 10:36.265
- Almost 19?

10:37.312 --> 10:38.173
Oh my God.

10:41.493 --> 10:42.326
- Fuck.

10:46.217 --> 10:47.050
God damn it.

10:50.370 --> 10:53.260
(upbeat music)

10:53.260 --> 10:54.430
- [Man] She's 19?

10:54.430 --> 10:56.030
What'd you guys even talk about?

11:00.550 --> 11:01.383
- I don't know.

11:01.383 --> 11:04.190
I think it's, maybe it's just fun

11:04.190 --> 11:06.190
hanging out with somebody that isn't 40.

11:07.310 --> 11:08.210
- I wouldn't know.

11:10.528 --> 11:13.111
(upbeat music)

11:22.460 --> 11:24.060
- Is that guitar still for sale?

11:25.440 --> 11:27.133
- [Man] Yeah, I think it is.

11:37.177 --> 11:40.010
(dramatic music)

11:51.370 --> 11:53.022
- [Man] Hey!

11:53.022 --> 11:56.189
Al, did you put the AC back in though?

12:03.532 --> 12:04.697
(phone vibrates)

12:04.697 --> 12:07.447
(dramatic music)

12:14.944 --> 12:17.154
(phone vibrates)

12:17.154 --> 12:19.904
(dramatic music)

12:34.772 --> 12:37.522
(dramatic music)

13:55.367 --> 13:59.740
- Gypsy cab just left, never
seen an angrier guy in my life.

13:59.740 --> 14:02.151
Lizzy, what are you doing?

14:02.151 --> 14:03.234
- I'm coming.

14:04.498 --> 14:05.331
I'm making sure I have everything.

14:07.401 --> 14:08.234
Okay.

14:13.340 --> 14:14.460
Maybe we shouldn't move.

14:14.460 --> 14:16.804
- [Man] Ugh, Lizzy, come on, please.

14:16.804 --> 14:19.380
- I mean shouldn't we just wait
until all our stuff is out?

14:19.380 --> 14:21.700
- [Man] Garth is gonna
send everything we need--

14:21.700 --> 14:22.720
- I just have this feeling that

14:22.720 --> 14:23.985
you're not going to get rid of this stuff,

14:23.985 --> 14:25.720
and you're not going
to sell this apartment

14:25.720 --> 14:26.867
and that would be insane Neil.

14:26.867 --> 14:27.700
- I know it would be.

14:27.700 --> 14:31.870
- Most guys keep a black
Book in case they break up,

14:31.870 --> 14:33.920
not entire fucking apartments.

14:37.954 --> 14:39.894
Is the pizza gonna suck in LA?

14:39.894 --> 14:44.227
- We're moving to Ontario,
and yes, it's gonna suck.

14:45.408 --> 14:47.543
- [Taxi] Wanna take the
bridge or the tunnel?

14:47.543 --> 14:49.373
- It doesn't matter.

14:50.572 --> 14:53.322
(dramatic music)

15:08.602 --> 15:11.185
(upbeat music)

15:25.260 --> 15:26.768
- You win Neil.

15:26.768 --> 15:29.351
(upbeat music)

15:31.169 --> 15:36.169
♪ Emily is out on the balcony ♪

15:36.524 --> 15:41.524
♪ Tonight ♪

15:42.499 --> 15:46.343

15:53.528 --> 15:58.528

♪ But I gotta tell you that
is something that I doubt ♪

16:14.350 --> 16:15.183
- [Lizzy] Fuck.

16:31.890 --> 16:32.743
- You ghosted me.

16:36.641 --> 16:37.593
Is it an age thing?

16:41.678 --> 16:44.607
- Kind of.

16:44.607 --> 16:46.183
- I kind of feel shitty.

16:55.632 --> 16:58.920
I came on too strong, I'm sorry.

16:58.920 --> 16:59.753
- No you didn't.

17:01.270 --> 17:02.580
You didn't do anything wrong at all.

17:02.580 --> 17:04.543
It was just a fucked up night.

17:09.870 --> 17:12.220
- Come on, let's go have
some fun, be friendly.

17:14.210 --> 17:15.983
So we can stop feeling like shit about it.

17:15.983 --> 17:18.566
(gentle music)

17:39.345 --> 17:41.240
- [Neil] 2.75 for a slice of pizza.

17:41.240 --> 17:42.080
- So you're one of those people

17:42.080 --> 17:44.120
who complains about the price of pizza?

17:44.120 --> 17:45.540
- These used to be a dollar.

17:45.540 --> 17:48.020
There used to be a pizza place right where

17:48.020 --> 17:49.703
that hotel is, and you
could get one of these at--

17:49.703 --> 17:51.873
- Now it's 2.75.

17:55.470 --> 17:56.303
Give me a bite.

17:58.070 --> 17:59.530
- Just take it, I'm not feeding you

17:59.530 --> 18:00.950
my million dollar slice of pizza.

18:00.950 --> 18:03.000
- It's just a bite and my hands are cold.

18:04.190 --> 18:05.210
- Your mistake.

18:05.210 --> 18:06.120
- If you don't give me a bite,

18:06.120 --> 18:08.210
I'm gonna start screaming
and you're gonna hate it.

18:08.210 --> 18:10.740
- All right, just fucking, go, go.

18:10.740 --> 18:15.740
(gentle music)
(Lizzy clattering)

18:23.837 --> 18:26.420
(gentle music)

18:32.650 --> 18:33.975
(Lizzy gasps)

18:33.975 --> 18:35.142
- [Lizzy] Wow.

18:36.918 --> 18:38.918
Where did you come from?

18:40.276 --> 18:42.859
(gentle music)

18:51.722 --> 18:52.930
(Lizzy gasps)

18:52.930 --> 18:54.580
Oh my God.

18:54.580 --> 18:56.068
- Nirvana.

18:56.068 --> 18:56.901
- What?

18:56.901 --> 18:57.843
Oh, I don't know.

18:57.843 --> 18:59.260
- This is the Old Man Game,

18:59.260 --> 19:01.410
you don't get I don't
know, it's yes or no.

19:02.290 --> 19:03.720
- No, you don't have to like them.

19:03.720 --> 19:06.630
- Thank God, cause I keep
listening and I just don't get it.

19:06.630 --> 19:09.170
- Well, they mattered in the 90's.

19:09.170 --> 19:10.800
- Bacon.

19:10.800 --> 19:11.633
- Kevin?

19:12.970 --> 19:14.470
Both bacon's are cool.

19:14.470 --> 19:15.760
- Music festivals.

19:15.760 --> 19:16.593
- Fuck no.

19:16.593 --> 19:17.426
- I know right?

19:18.670 --> 19:19.503
California?

19:20.546 --> 19:22.687
- You've never been?

19:22.687 --> 19:24.240
- I'm supposed to go on a
road trip with a friend,

19:24.240 --> 19:25.733
during the summer when
she goes down to collage

19:25.733 --> 19:28.173
but I have to learn how to drive first.

19:29.150 --> 19:30.650
I wanna go to Big Sur someday.

19:31.950 --> 19:34.780
- California's cool just
don't ever move there.

19:34.780 --> 19:36.060
People who move to
California from New York

19:36.060 --> 19:37.370
just talk about the bars that they used

19:37.370 --> 19:38.510
to drink at when they're here.

19:38.510 --> 19:39.790
- Those are probably the same people

19:39.790 --> 19:41.840
who talked about moving the
entire time they were here.

19:41.840 --> 19:42.673
- Yeah.

19:43.520 --> 19:44.353
Hey!

19:46.780 --> 19:48.386
- Why thank you.

19:48.386 --> 19:51.053
(door creaking)

19:54.057 --> 19:56.640
(gentle music)

20:11.678 --> 20:14.428
(Lizzy thudding)

20:15.293 --> 20:18.043
(dramatic music)

20:26.733 --> 20:29.316
(gentle music)

20:45.160 --> 20:48.160
(suspenseful music)

21:16.022 --> 21:18.768
(door thuds)

21:18.768 --> 21:21.601
(machine beeping)

21:23.890 --> 21:25.390
- [Doctor] Don't give up hope.

21:30.130 --> 21:30.983
- She'll wake up.

21:34.340 --> 21:35.940
- [Doctor] She's a fighter, huh?

21:41.360 --> 21:42.193
- Not at all.

21:43.270 --> 21:44.863
She just gets bored real easy.

21:51.050 --> 21:51.883
- [Man] Hey Neil.

21:51.883 --> 21:52.716
Long time, no talk.

21:53.870 --> 21:56.760
- Hey Dennis, what are you doing here?

21:56.760 --> 21:59.780
- [Dennis] I guess I'm
her emergency contact.

21:59.780 --> 22:00.710
- [Neil] You are?

22:00.710 --> 22:02.500
Where, on what, how would she even?

22:02.500 --> 22:03.470
- [Doctor] He's her brother, right?

22:03.470 --> 22:04.533
- [Dennis] Half brother.

22:06.060 --> 22:07.420
- [Doctor] It's protocol for the

22:07.420 --> 22:09.273
emergency contact to be contacted.

22:12.180 --> 22:13.643
- [Dennis] She looks different.

22:14.820 --> 22:16.560
Man, it's the craziest thing

22:16.560 --> 22:19.170
yesterday at work a buddy of
mine, young guy, healthy guy

22:19.170 --> 22:21.910
collapsed right on site and
had a full blown stroke.

22:21.910 --> 22:23.300
He's in ICU right now.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.514
Can't talk or nothing and now this.

22:25.514 --> 22:28.431
(phone vibrating)

22:29.720 --> 22:31.040
This is Dennis.

22:31.040 --> 22:33.183
Yeah, I'm at Brooklyn Methodist.

22:35.520 --> 22:37.823
No, no somebody else.

22:40.450 --> 22:42.300
I can look into it later, I gotta go.

22:49.310 --> 22:50.160
I heard through the grapevine

22:50.160 --> 22:52.123
you guys are getting divorced, aren't you?

22:55.430 --> 22:57.540
- [Neil] We've been separated for awhile.

22:57.540 --> 22:58.540
- [Dennis] Jesus, man.

22:58.540 --> 23:00.183
This is really something.

23:01.050 --> 23:03.033
But you're relived, I got it from here.

23:04.530 --> 23:05.710
Yeah, don't worry about a thing,

23:05.710 --> 23:07.173
we're overdue for a catch-up.

23:08.946 --> 23:09.779
- [Neil] Are you sure?

23:09.779 --> 23:11.414
- [Dennis] Yes.

23:11.414 --> 23:12.718
- [Neil] All right, wait.

23:12.718 --> 23:14.135
- [Dennis] Right.

23:15.780 --> 23:18.620
- [Neil] So you're going
to hang out, right?

23:18.620 --> 23:20.920
I don't want her to wake
up and have nobody be here

23:20.920 --> 23:23.133
cause she's not gonna
know what's going on and?

23:25.510 --> 23:26.343
Okay.

23:26.343 --> 23:27.176
- Bye Neil.

23:28.448 --> 23:31.281
(phone vibrating)

23:36.841 --> 23:38.484
(upbeat music)

23:38.484 --> 23:40.549
- Happy 40th birthday Neil.

23:40.549 --> 23:45.526
(audience applauding)
(audience cheering)

23:45.526 --> 23:49.240
- Get that damn fire in the hole, speech.

23:49.240 --> 23:50.073
- No speech.

23:50.920 --> 23:52.380
- Here's to being middle aged.

23:52.380 --> 23:54.077
- [Neil] 50's middle aged, not 40.

23:54.077 --> 23:55.930
- Only a 40 year old would say that.

23:55.930 --> 23:57.613
- Hey wait, your gift.

24:00.740 --> 24:01.990
- You didn't have to get me anything.

24:01.990 --> 24:03.750
- I didn't.

24:03.750 --> 24:05.850
I got you something better than something.

24:06.940 --> 24:08.190
- Okay.

24:08.190 --> 24:11.500
- Anytime from now until one of us dies,

24:11.500 --> 24:14.030
no matter how far life has taken us,

24:14.030 --> 24:15.673
I owe you one big favor.

24:16.540 --> 24:17.940
No matter how big and impossible,

24:17.940 --> 24:21.670
no matter how bad the
timing, no matter anything.

24:21.670 --> 24:22.503
One favor.

24:24.210 --> 24:26.560
If something truly terrible happens

24:26.560 --> 24:29.413
and you have no where else
to turn, you can call me.

24:30.560 --> 24:31.980
Or if you desperately need a pack

24:31.980 --> 24:34.450
of smokes or someone to lie for you.

24:34.450 --> 24:35.797
Whatever, anything.

24:41.261 --> 24:42.522
Happy birthday.

24:42.522 --> 24:45.105
(gentle music)

24:54.808 --> 24:57.558
(dramatic music)

25:37.717 --> 25:40.550
(machine beeping)

26:39.922 --> 26:42.755
(phone vibrating)

26:53.682 --> 26:55.182
- Neil, Neil help.

26:58.318 --> 27:01.348
(phone vibrating)

27:01.348 --> 27:02.181
Help.

27:03.803 --> 27:04.636
Help!

27:06.778 --> 27:07.695
Neil, help.

27:09.150 --> 27:09.983
- Lizzy, hold on.

27:09.983 --> 27:11.245
- Neil, help, help.

27:11.245 --> 27:12.202
- Hold on, wait, wait,
wait, hold on, hold on.

27:12.202 --> 27:13.259
I'll get somebody, hold on.

27:13.259 --> 27:14.092
- Help!

27:16.260 --> 27:17.093
- Lizzy?

27:18.382 --> 27:19.215
- What?

27:19.215 --> 27:20.450
- There was an accident.

27:20.450 --> 27:22.199
You're in a hospital.

27:22.199 --> 27:24.460
We had to perform emergency surgery

27:24.460 --> 27:26.260
and the only way to
stabilize you in recovery

27:26.260 --> 27:28.180
was to induce a coma, you understand?

27:28.180 --> 27:30.107
- Is my body still asleep?

27:32.140 --> 27:33.610
Do I have to shake something off?

27:33.610 --> 27:36.730
Like when you rest your elbows
on your knees for too long?

27:36.730 --> 27:40.150
- There was major damage
to your spinal cord,

27:40.150 --> 27:42.640
your brain luckily is
in very good condition,

27:42.640 --> 27:44.440
you sustained serious injury

27:44.440 --> 27:47.730
to what's called the C7 vertebrae.

27:47.730 --> 27:48.563
- What's that mean?

27:48.563 --> 27:50.950
- It's a quadriplegic injury,

27:50.950 --> 27:54.700
the C7 vertebrae primarily
innervates your triceps,

27:54.700 --> 27:56.430
and as you can see you do have neck

27:56.430 --> 27:59.243
and shoulder movement
which is a fantastic sign.

28:00.140 --> 28:04.343
However it is very likely that
you will never walk again.

28:09.860 --> 28:12.380
You'll need to attend physical therapy

28:12.380 --> 28:15.580
to see if there's any
progress in your body,

28:15.580 --> 28:18.350
but we really have no way of knowing

28:18.350 --> 28:22.340
what type of movement or
feeling you'll have, if any.

28:22.340 --> 28:25.780
Typically with luck and
work you'll gain some

28:25.780 --> 28:28.800
wrist function and
sometimes C7's can even use

28:28.800 --> 28:31.842
their arms and only have some
tingling in their fingers.

28:31.842 --> 28:33.873
It really all depends.

28:38.509 --> 28:39.342
- Neil.

28:40.900 --> 28:41.733
- What?

28:51.360 --> 28:54.350
Hey, excuse me, excuse me,
can I ask you something?

28:54.350 --> 28:55.920
Have you seen her brother?

28:55.920 --> 28:57.260
- No, not for a while now.

28:57.260 --> 28:59.830
- Okay, so she's been in
there by herself, right?

28:59.830 --> 29:00.784
I asked you guys
specifically to let me know--

29:00.784 --> 29:04.620
Spaghetti, burgers, and quesadillas.

29:04.620 --> 29:07.410
Oh wait no, that's a
spaghetti burger quesadilla.

29:07.410 --> 29:08.930
- I pictured a cute little cafe

29:08.930 --> 29:11.840
by our cute little house outside of LA.

29:11.840 --> 29:14.270
Instead it's this salt
factory for families

29:14.270 --> 29:15.893
of six who all hate different things.

29:15.893 --> 29:17.890
- Listen, we came here because of you,

29:17.890 --> 29:19.343
you wanted to come here, I didn't.

29:19.343 --> 29:21.700
- I didn't know we'd be
moving to a diabetes colony.

29:21.700 --> 29:23.800
- I told you, that's what America is,

29:23.800 --> 29:26.140
it's Brooklyn and diabetes factories.

29:26.140 --> 29:27.340
- Okay, I LA can't be like that.

29:27.340 --> 29:28.539
- LA probably isn't like that,

29:28.539 --> 29:31.135
but you didn't want to go to
LA, you wanted to come here.

29:31.135 --> 29:32.130
Do you want to go to LA?

29:32.130 --> 29:33.180
- No.

29:33.180 --> 29:35.600
I hear the rentals in LA don't
even come with refrigerators.

29:35.600 --> 29:37.330
So, no.

29:37.330 --> 29:38.830
Besides, LA is was too predictable,

29:38.830 --> 29:39.990
then we'd just be that couple

29:39.990 --> 29:42.050
that moves from New York to LA.

29:42.050 --> 29:43.390
Always explaining the different

29:43.390 --> 29:44.771
neighborhoods to our friends.

29:44.771 --> 29:47.730
Oh, this is so like Williamsburg,

29:47.730 --> 29:50.780
or this is so like Silver Lake.

29:50.780 --> 29:52.520
Stupid stuff like that.

29:52.520 --> 29:54.793
God, it's stupid Neil, and you know it.

29:55.760 --> 29:57.140
Moving to LA from New York

29:57.140 --> 30:01.960
is for people that say dumb
things like I hate the winter,

30:01.960 --> 30:04.590
or oh my God, I miss having a car.

30:04.590 --> 30:05.860
Stupid shit like that.

30:05.860 --> 30:07.070
I can't believe I chased you back

30:07.070 --> 30:08.973
to this stupid fucking shit hole.

30:11.840 --> 30:13.363
We should just do euthanasia.

30:13.363 --> 30:14.196
- You know what?

30:14.196 --> 30:16.003
Can we just wait and see
how much you hate all

30:16.003 --> 30:18.340
this before we start thinking
about stuff like that?

30:18.340 --> 30:20.790
Neither of us have any
idea how this is gonna go.

30:27.010 --> 30:29.620
- Do you remember that Almodóvar movie?

30:29.620 --> 30:31.480
The one where the nurse has sex

30:31.480 --> 30:33.280
with the woman when she's in a coma?

30:39.380 --> 30:40.683
- Yeah, I remember it.

30:43.520 --> 30:44.820
We saw it at the Angelica.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.210
- No.

30:47.210 --> 30:50.661
We saw it at the other
movie theater on Halston.

30:50.661 --> 30:51.710
The one on the east side,

30:51.710 --> 30:54.743
the one no one ever remembers is there.

30:55.870 --> 30:57.120
Right next to that bright

30:57.120 --> 30:59.073
all night diner with all the desserts.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.113
- Right.

31:07.177 --> 31:08.760
Yeah, you're right.

31:11.720 --> 31:13.940
Both of those are gone by the way.

31:13.940 --> 31:16.690
- [Lizzy] I told you, everything
that we loved is dead.

31:18.230 --> 31:19.513
Our New York is dead.

31:22.880 --> 31:24.083
Why did you come back?

31:26.684 --> 31:27.517
- I don't know.

31:30.070 --> 31:33.433
There's always a new New
York on deck I guess.

31:34.970 --> 31:37.292
- [Lizzy] Did you fuck
me while I was in a coma?

31:37.292 --> 31:38.125
- What?

31:38.125 --> 31:39.350
No.

31:39.350 --> 31:40.640
- You prude.

31:40.640 --> 31:41.473
- All right.

31:45.830 --> 31:48.630
- Hey, wait, wait, wait, where ya going?

31:48.630 --> 31:53.260
- I gotta go, I got, I
got to do some stuff.

31:53.260 --> 31:54.093
- Work?

31:54.093 --> 31:55.233
- [Neil] Yeah, I gotta work.

31:56.080 --> 31:56.913
- Oh.

31:58.220 --> 31:59.300
- [Neil] I'll see you later.

31:59.300 --> 32:00.133
- Yeah.

32:02.077 --> 32:03.737
Yeah, I'll see you later.

32:03.737 --> 32:06.570
(machine beeping)

32:33.830 --> 32:36.580
(dramatic music)

33:46.037 --> 33:46.954
- You okay?

33:50.103 --> 33:52.853
Can you do the other side for me?

33:59.625 --> 34:00.987
- [Man] Okay, coming loose.

34:00.987 --> 34:01.820
- Okay.

34:04.978 --> 34:06.235
Get the Velcro.

34:06.235 --> 34:08.985
(Velcro ripping)

34:12.969 --> 34:14.219
Take your time.

34:18.483 --> 34:19.566
- [Man] Okay.

34:28.982 --> 34:31.649
(wood clatters)

34:33.581 --> 34:36.331
(hammer banging)

34:54.910 --> 34:57.410
(Neil crying)

35:15.928 --> 35:17.511
- Lizzy, I'm Nelly.

35:18.947 --> 35:20.920
I'm a training nurse

35:20.920 --> 35:23.127
Not a nurse in training,
but a training nurse.

35:23.127 --> 35:25.193
God, it's a stupid name for a nurse.

35:26.530 --> 35:27.850
- What does one of those do?

35:27.850 --> 35:28.790
- I help you transition

35:28.790 --> 35:31.470
to the inpatient part of your recovery.

35:31.470 --> 35:34.118
Do you have any questions
about anything so far?

35:34.118 --> 35:35.630
It must be nice to be out of the vest.

35:35.630 --> 35:37.730
Get a little movement into your shoulders.

35:38.813 --> 35:40.063
- I don't know.

35:41.090 --> 35:43.173
- [Nelly] I guess you
must feel really weird.

35:45.940 --> 35:47.960
- You know, people used to accuse me

35:47.960 --> 35:50.080
of white knuckling it through life

35:50.080 --> 35:55.060
and now it's like, I
can't even move my hands.

35:55.060 --> 35:57.510
- We'll get you white
knuckling again in no time.

36:01.315 --> 36:03.982
(gentle music)

36:30.637 --> 36:31.671
- Cheers.

36:31.671 --> 36:33.450
(woman laughs)

36:33.450 --> 36:35.851
- Hi Spoon, right?

36:35.851 --> 36:37.573
I really loved the Ramon's cover.

36:38.970 --> 36:40.520
- It was Tom Waits.

36:40.520 --> 36:41.660
- Thanks.

36:41.660 --> 36:43.950
- You know, we do a show here every month,

36:43.950 --> 36:46.420
a singer, songwriter,
showcase type of thing.

36:46.420 --> 36:50.140
And if you have any originals,
you should stop by sometime.

36:50.140 --> 36:52.140
- Yeah, totally.

36:52.140 --> 36:53.040
- Do you play too?

36:55.620 --> 36:56.453
- No.

36:57.640 --> 36:59.363
- Yeah, he does.

37:01.690 --> 37:04.720
- Okay, well I hope I see you around.

37:04.720 --> 37:05.670
- Yeah, definitely.

37:07.610 --> 37:09.090
Weirdo.

37:09.090 --> 37:10.830
Are you embarrassed?

37:10.830 --> 37:11.663
- No.

37:13.300 --> 37:15.470
The only thing worse than
the people within Bohemia

37:15.470 --> 37:18.700
are the people outside of
it, trust me, I've done both.

37:18.700 --> 37:20.120
I'm not going to dabble around

37:20.120 --> 37:23.610
on stage for this pack of Philistines.

37:23.610 --> 37:24.910
- Filly what?

37:24.910 --> 37:26.843
- Philistines, artless idiots.

37:27.680 --> 37:30.700
These people, they're just tourists.

37:30.700 --> 37:32.820
They treat performing in Brooklyn

37:32.820 --> 37:35.480
like the resume builder,
play New York city check.

37:35.480 --> 37:36.930
Not one of them has any intention

37:36.930 --> 37:38.330
of pushing themselves creatively.

37:38.330 --> 37:40.680
And even if they wanted to,
they wouldn't know how to.

37:40.680 --> 37:45.260
These kids, these, they're
just playing with house money.

37:45.260 --> 37:46.770
Half of them have trust funds.

37:46.770 --> 37:49.133
These kids can leave
whenever they want to.

37:50.690 --> 37:51.760
They're just tourists.

37:51.760 --> 37:53.470
- You're a tourist.

37:53.470 --> 37:54.810
I'm from here.

37:54.810 --> 37:57.310
- You weren't hanging
at Mars Bar 15 years ago

37:57.310 --> 37:59.080
you were just teething, will you trust me?

37:59.080 --> 38:00.893
Hey, can we get a couple more shots?

38:01.840 --> 38:05.960
- One, two, three, four.

38:05.960 --> 38:07.190
Hold it sustained.

38:07.190 --> 38:08.623
- That's really good Lizzy.

38:09.830 --> 38:12.363
Yeah, keep it going, one more time.

38:14.100 --> 38:15.850
So good.

38:15.850 --> 38:17.659
- Now let's go back one, two, three.

38:17.659 --> 38:19.235
- [Nelly] Nice, come on Lizzy,

38:19.235 --> 38:20.280
nothing in life comes easy, right?

38:20.280 --> 38:21.113
- Oh my God.

38:21.113 --> 38:21.946
If she's going to continue talking to me

38:21.946 --> 38:24.690
like that put my head under the water.

38:24.690 --> 38:25.951
- One, two, three.

38:25.951 --> 38:27.130
- [Nelly] Good.

38:27.130 --> 38:28.973
- Hold that, good job.

38:51.370 --> 38:52.203
- Hey.

38:53.850 --> 38:54.683
- Hi Neil.

38:57.250 --> 38:58.657
- Liz, I'm really sorry that

38:58.657 --> 39:00.383
I haven't been coming that much.

39:00.383 --> 39:02.363
- My nurse is a nightmare.

39:03.850 --> 39:04.683
Look around

39:12.055 --> 39:13.550
- What are you watching?

39:13.550 --> 39:16.040
- Just some stupid
fucking inspirational shit

39:16.040 --> 39:17.563
this nurse leaves on at night.

39:18.650 --> 39:19.483
- [Neil] I can't believe
the way this is edited.

39:19.483 --> 39:20.493
- [Lizzy] Look at the transitions.

39:22.390 --> 39:24.923
- Hey, who brought that?

39:26.200 --> 39:27.730
- You're pointing, I can't see.

39:27.730 --> 39:30.880
- Well just guess what the only thing

39:30.880 --> 39:32.510
over here I would ever point at is?

39:32.510 --> 39:34.950
- Oh, Garth brought that.

39:34.950 --> 39:35.850
- Garth came here?

39:36.880 --> 39:39.063
- Of course, we're friends.

39:48.400 --> 39:52.250
- Liz, I am so sorry.

39:52.250 --> 39:54.450
I've been trying to figure out how to--

39:54.450 --> 39:56.523
- I need you to Almodóvar me Neil.

39:57.753 --> 39:58.586
- What?

39:58.586 --> 40:00.580
- I already know what your
gonna fight me on this.

40:02.220 --> 40:04.080
And I already know what
we have accomplished

40:04.080 --> 40:06.914
all that we are going to accomplish but.

40:06.914 --> 40:07.747
- Lizzy, we can't do that.

40:07.747 --> 40:09.580
- I need to feel someone close to me.

40:11.347 --> 40:13.222
- I am close to you, it's crazy.

40:13.222 --> 40:14.260
- I feel like I'm gonna fucking die

40:14.260 --> 40:17.387
if I don't feel someone
close to me Neil, please.

40:17.387 --> 40:19.207
- What am I supposed, like?

40:19.207 --> 40:20.290
- Please.

40:20.290 --> 40:21.642
- What are we supposed to do, we're in a--

40:21.642 --> 40:26.593
- It's for science or, just, Neil please?

40:28.340 --> 40:30.754
- I don't know how, what
am I supposed to do?

40:30.754 --> 40:31.656
You're hooked up to machines.

40:31.656 --> 40:33.017
- Please.

40:33.017 --> 40:33.850
- Fuck.

40:35.320 --> 40:36.750
I will try it, but we are gonna

40:36.750 --> 40:39.213
do this really, really quickly.

40:40.130 --> 40:41.237
Can this come off?

40:44.919 --> 40:45.752
All right.

40:45.752 --> 40:48.419
(machine beeps)

40:50.256 --> 40:54.157
- Oh my God, it's red.

40:54.157 --> 40:54.990
Holy.

40:57.260 --> 40:58.093
Oh my God.

40:58.093 --> 41:03.093
- [Neil] Yeah, yeah it's
as ridiculous as ever.

41:03.178 --> 41:04.178
- Oh my God.

41:05.130 --> 41:06.873
- [Neil] I wonder what
that's supposed to be?

41:06.873 --> 41:09.290
- Okay, I'm putting the keys.

41:12.707 --> 41:13.927
Oh my God.

41:13.927 --> 41:15.163
The towels are tiny.

41:21.690 --> 41:23.190
Neil, really look.

41:25.541 --> 41:27.409
- [Neil] Can we both fit in here?

41:27.409 --> 41:29.242
- I don't know, go on.

41:30.953 --> 41:33.870
I think this is, this is kind

41:33.870 --> 41:36.186
of everything I expected this to be.

41:36.186 --> 41:38.861
(Neil chuckles)

41:38.861 --> 41:40.260
Oh my God.

41:40.260 --> 41:42.400
- Well do you want, do you
want me to get in with you?

41:42.400 --> 41:43.233
- No.

41:44.907 --> 41:48.200
I want you to admire me
in this lovely bathtub.

41:48.200 --> 41:50.108
Do I look like a queen?

41:50.108 --> 41:52.691
(gentle music)

41:57.370 --> 41:58.203
- [Neil] Yeah.

41:58.203 --> 41:59.738
- Yes, in her royal bathing chamber.

42:01.890 --> 42:02.763
- Yeah.

42:08.507 --> 42:09.714
- [Lizzy] Are you throwing a fit

42:09.714 --> 42:11.473
because we aren't having sex?

42:15.400 --> 42:16.233
- I'm fine.

42:16.233 --> 42:17.313
- Okay, you're not fine.

42:19.180 --> 42:21.070
- I just don't get it,
why did we even come here?

42:21.070 --> 42:21.903
We spent 150 bucks.

42:21.903 --> 42:23.750
- Because it's weird, and it's something

42:23.750 --> 42:26.020
that we've never done before.

42:26.020 --> 42:27.240
Oh my God, you didn't think that we were

42:27.240 --> 42:29.100
actually gonna come
here to have sex, right?

42:29.100 --> 42:31.750
- I mean is that so crazy?

42:31.750 --> 42:33.040
We're here, why don't we just--

42:33.040 --> 42:36.450
- Oh sorry Neil that this soft core

42:36.450 --> 42:39.110
baby boomer shit doesn't turn me on.

42:39.110 --> 42:42.700
Porn in the TV, a tepid
bathtub, corny lights.

42:42.700 --> 42:43.880
What, we're we supposed to come here

42:43.880 --> 42:46.200
and have some magic night of passion?

42:46.200 --> 42:48.350
This isn't serious, it's ironic.

42:48.350 --> 42:50.283
This isn't serious.

42:51.170 --> 42:54.450
God, there's probably a
pool full of fat swingers,

42:54.450 --> 42:55.353
should we join in on that to?

42:55.353 --> 42:57.330
- Okay, then why are we sleeping here?

42:57.330 --> 42:58.220
Why didn't we come and look

42:58.220 --> 42:59.053
at it and laugh, and then we could--

42:59.053 --> 43:00.190
- [Lizzy] Because it
was supposed to be fun,

43:00.190 --> 43:02.790
and instead all night you're
acting like a predator.

43:04.930 --> 43:06.643
- So that's it, you're going to sleep?

43:06.643 --> 43:09.393
(people moaning)

43:12.740 --> 43:14.370
- Fine.

43:14.370 --> 43:15.203
Fuck me.

43:16.313 --> 43:18.977
Fuck me Neil, I'm conceding.

43:18.977 --> 43:21.077
God if you can even get hard.

43:21.077 --> 43:23.513
- Oh, yeah, this is fun.

43:29.590 --> 43:31.290
- [Lizzy] I think I feel you Neil.

43:32.720 --> 43:33.553
- Yeah.

43:33.553 --> 43:34.386
- [Lizzy] Are you hard?

43:35.829 --> 43:36.662
- Mmhm.

43:40.600 --> 43:41.433
- How bizarre.

43:43.170 --> 43:44.003
Am I wet?

43:46.140 --> 43:46.973
- Yeah.

43:52.226 --> 43:54.026
- I think I feel you inside me Neil.

44:00.110 --> 44:00.943
Oh wow.

44:04.387 --> 44:06.891
You're Almodóvaring me.

44:06.891 --> 44:07.966
Kind of.

44:07.966 --> 44:10.549
(gentle music)

44:19.600 --> 44:20.433
Did you cum?

44:26.630 --> 44:27.463
- Yeah.

44:29.980 --> 44:31.430
- Neil I need you to hold me.

44:37.446 --> 44:40.002
- You know I don't like
cuddling after sex.

44:40.002 --> 44:42.585
(gentle music)

45:03.644 --> 45:04.570
- [Woman] Hi.

45:04.570 --> 45:06.270
- Hi, Spoon.

45:06.270 --> 45:07.540
- Riley.

45:07.540 --> 45:08.543
Nice to meet you.

45:09.590 --> 45:11.683
So, this is it.

45:12.680 --> 45:15.775
I try to keep it pretty tidy.

45:15.775 --> 45:17.490
Don't bring the party home, all that.

45:17.490 --> 45:20.290
- Yeah, don't worry, I don't
bring the party home either.

45:20.290 --> 45:21.690
Those days are behind me.

45:21.690 --> 45:23.260
- Cool.

45:23.260 --> 45:24.770
How old did you say you were?

45:24.770 --> 45:25.670
- Turning 20 soon.

45:27.970 --> 45:29.533
- So what are you into?

45:30.400 --> 45:32.483
I dabble a bit in music.

45:33.770 --> 45:35.630
But it's not too loud, don't worry.

45:35.630 --> 45:37.970
- Oh cool, dabble.

45:37.970 --> 45:40.360
- Yeah, you know, here and there.

45:40.360 --> 45:42.630
Do you play an instruments?

45:42.630 --> 45:43.463
- Nah.

45:47.160 --> 45:49.490
- That's Vic Falls, you ever been?

45:49.490 --> 45:51.440
- I haven't even been to Niagara Falls.

45:54.130 --> 45:55.330
- [Riley] South America?

45:58.080 --> 45:58.923
Bora Bora?

46:00.290 --> 46:01.163
India?

46:01.163 --> 46:02.330
- No.

46:02.330 --> 46:03.193
- Yellow Stone?

46:05.160 --> 46:06.810
Have you ever done any traveling?

46:07.870 --> 46:08.970
- I've been to Queens.

46:12.550 --> 46:13.620
I'm actually supposed to go on

46:13.620 --> 46:15.490
a cross country road trip in a few months.

46:15.490 --> 46:16.990
- [Riley] Oh, fun.

46:16.990 --> 46:18.340
I've done that.

46:18.340 --> 46:19.570
What route are you gonna take?

46:19.570 --> 46:20.750
Through Chicago?

46:20.750 --> 46:21.650
- I don't even know yet.

46:21.650 --> 46:24.193
I actually have to learn
how to drive first.

46:25.360 --> 46:28.490
- Well when I went, we
went through Chicago.

46:28.490 --> 46:31.810
And then through New
Orleans on the way back.

46:31.810 --> 46:35.973
We actually went the wrong
way, and ended up at the Alamo.

46:37.537 --> 46:39.770
Which wasn't as impressive as I had hoped,

46:39.770 --> 46:41.833
but they have a really good gift shop.

46:47.107 --> 46:48.515
- That's her.

46:48.515 --> 46:49.348
- Yep.

46:52.040 --> 46:53.580
- [Nelly] Hi, I'm Nelly.

46:54.711 --> 46:55.544
- Hi.

46:55.544 --> 46:56.377
- You're Neil.

46:56.377 --> 46:57.210
- Yup.

47:01.400 --> 47:02.690
- Is this the Beatles.

47:02.690 --> 47:06.170
- Yeah, it's nice to listen to
some upbeat stuff, you know?

47:06.170 --> 47:09.356
- Just casually sitting around,
listening to the Beatles?

47:09.356 --> 47:12.000
- Yeah, you don't?

47:12.000 --> 47:14.290
- No, I try to push
myself a little furthers,

47:14.290 --> 47:16.010
so I don't really sit around

47:16.010 --> 47:18.460
and listen to the Beatles
and neither does Lizzy.

47:24.430 --> 47:26.930
(Nelly sighs)

47:32.380 --> 47:34.550
- So how's it all going?

47:34.550 --> 47:36.560
Hopefully you're staying
positive with this stuff,

47:36.560 --> 47:38.610
I know it can be a really big adjustment.

47:40.300 --> 47:43.120
You know, one of the keys is to think

47:43.120 --> 47:45.960
about the things that
used to make you happy.

47:45.960 --> 47:47.250
And then get to the deeper meaning of them

47:47.250 --> 47:48.540
because you can replace

47:48.540 --> 47:50.970
those feelings with different actions.

47:50.970 --> 47:52.120
What did you like ding?

47:53.760 --> 47:54.593
- Arguing.

47:54.593 --> 47:56.550
- Well that will still be easy.

47:56.550 --> 47:57.383
Anything else?

47:59.027 --> 48:00.300
- I liked to listen to music.

48:00.300 --> 48:01.150
- Did you dance at all?

48:01.150 --> 48:05.000
- No, no, I liked to listen
to music, I don't dance to it.

48:05.000 --> 48:05.953
You don't get it.

48:05.953 --> 48:08.520
- Well it sounds to me
like you can still do that.

48:08.520 --> 48:09.870
What is something that you used

48:09.870 --> 48:11.470
to do that you can't do anymore?

48:17.690 --> 48:18.950
- Drinking.

48:18.950 --> 48:19.783
- Well that's--

48:19.783 --> 48:20.616
- I liked drinking.

48:20.616 --> 48:22.461
- That's something, being
social, going out with friends.

48:22.461 --> 48:25.630
- No, no that's not
what I'm talking about.

48:25.630 --> 48:26.734
I liked to drink, I'm not talking

48:26.734 --> 48:28.660
about going out with a bunch of girls

48:28.660 --> 48:30.210
on some stupid fucking ladies night

48:30.210 --> 48:32.950
and talking about our
periods, I like to drink

48:34.070 --> 48:36.100
- Okay well something else,

48:36.100 --> 48:38.563
maybe something healthy that you'll miss.

48:44.307 --> 48:45.700
- The animals.

48:45.700 --> 48:47.710
- You mean like petting animals?

48:47.710 --> 48:48.797
- Yes.

48:48.797 --> 48:49.883
I don't know.

48:50.990 --> 48:54.500
No, I liked watching animals.

48:54.500 --> 48:56.580
- Animals are still around.

48:56.580 --> 48:59.460
Lizzy, something that
you did with your legs.

48:59.460 --> 49:01.300
- Oh, you mean like walking?

49:01.300 --> 49:02.850
Yeah I'm really gonna miss walking,

49:02.850 --> 49:05.130
actually you know what
else I'm gonna miss?

49:05.130 --> 49:07.740
I'm going miss shaving my
own legs, shitting on my own,

49:07.740 --> 49:08.610
showering on my own,

49:08.610 --> 49:10.413
and geez, those are just in the bathroom.

49:10.413 --> 49:12.040
There's a whole litany of things

49:12.040 --> 49:13.827
that I am going to miss, all of it.

49:13.827 --> 49:15.160
- [Nelly] All right but the point

49:15.160 --> 49:15.993
of the exercise is that we try to--

49:15.993 --> 49:17.600
- Yeah, no, no, no, I get the point,

49:17.600 --> 49:19.180
I get the point, you're
trying to get me to realize

49:19.180 --> 49:20.940
that everything is going
to be okay, but it's not.

49:20.940 --> 49:24.633
It is not going to be okay,
I cannot use my fucking body.

49:25.840 --> 49:26.683
I am a fuck up.

49:28.266 --> 49:30.093
Man I am a fuck up.

49:31.930 --> 49:33.540
A few millimeters and the
doctor said I wouldn't

49:33.540 --> 49:34.720
have felt a thing, I would have

49:34.720 --> 49:37.773
just been asleep for forever.

49:41.200 --> 49:42.840
Take this out of my ear.

49:42.840 --> 49:45.792
Take this bubblegum crap
out of my ear right now.

49:45.792 --> 49:47.150
Now stick it in your own, turn it up

49:47.150 --> 49:49.650
and listen to it like the
philistine that you are.

50:02.570 --> 50:04.227
- If there's a fire, can you get?

50:05.110 --> 50:06.510
- Why would there be a fire?

50:07.973 --> 50:11.010
- For the same reason
there are always fires.

50:11.010 --> 50:12.673
Fire is a thing that exists.

50:13.990 --> 50:14.823
- [Spoon] Hey roommate.

50:14.823 --> 50:16.100
- And so are dead people.

50:16.100 --> 50:17.230
- Hey roomie.

50:17.230 --> 50:19.810
- Hey, this is Neil, my moving buddy.

50:19.810 --> 50:20.643
- Hi.

50:20.643 --> 50:21.476
- Hi.

50:21.476 --> 50:22.309
- How's it going?

50:22.309 --> 50:23.142
- Do you need help?

50:23.142 --> 50:23.975
- [Spoon] Oh no, you don't have to.

50:23.975 --> 50:25.017
- Oh don't be silly, I've moved all over

50:25.017 --> 50:28.063
the world by myself, I
know how awful it is.

50:31.420 --> 50:32.850
- She a back packer?

50:32.850 --> 50:34.320
- Yeah, she's been everywhere.

50:34.320 --> 50:35.980
How'd you know?

50:35.980 --> 50:38.330
- Cause only the worst
people wear those pants.

50:39.740 --> 50:41.933
- I saw one just like this in Italy.

50:45.029 --> 50:47.280
- You know how you can tell
if somebody's traveled a lot?

50:47.280 --> 50:48.113
- [Spoon] How?

50:49.140 --> 50:50.580
- They'll tell you.

50:50.580 --> 50:53.330
(Spoon chuckles)

50:55.360 --> 50:56.560
- Lily.

50:56.560 --> 50:57.393
- Hi.

50:57.393 --> 50:58.226
- Hey.

50:58.226 --> 51:00.020
- Are you here for the showcase?

51:00.020 --> 51:00.853
- Yeah.

51:02.030 --> 51:03.420
It's Spoon.

51:03.420 --> 51:04.730
- Spoon?

51:04.730 --> 51:07.752
- Yeah, Spoon, we met at the open mic.

51:07.752 --> 51:11.123
- Oh, cool, yeah, yeah, I remember.

51:12.220 --> 51:13.820
I'll put you on the list.

51:13.820 --> 51:15.757
- Thanks, yeah, it's really.

51:17.381 --> 51:18.214
Cool.

51:20.422 --> 51:23.089
(gentle music)

52:18.324 --> 52:19.157
- Hey!

52:19.157 --> 52:21.500
Don't put your shit in my trash.

52:21.500 --> 52:24.383
You don't put your trash
in my trash, fucking idiot.

52:25.827 --> 52:27.590
Are you fucking crazy?

52:27.590 --> 52:29.403
Putting your trash in my trash, huh?

52:30.750 --> 52:31.596
What do you think?

52:31.596 --> 52:33.240
- [Spoon] Let's get some back to backs.

52:33.240 --> 52:34.740
- [Garth] Why not?

52:36.540 --> 52:37.890
- I'll do one with you all.

52:46.680 --> 52:47.950
Cheers guys.

52:47.950 --> 52:48.783
- [Both] Cheers.

52:53.907 --> 52:54.740
- Oh.

53:02.327 --> 53:03.160
Cheers.

53:06.756 --> 53:08.230
You know Neil was a musician, right?

53:08.230 --> 53:09.620
He ever talk to you about any of that?

53:09.620 --> 53:13.633
I mean, he was like, really good.

53:14.710 --> 53:16.847
Like he used to play at
Brown, you know, Brownings?

53:16.847 --> 53:18.810
No, no, you don't remember Brownings.

53:18.810 --> 53:20.927
Anyway, he used to play at this
place Brownings every week,

53:20.927 --> 53:22.840
it was like a great club

53:22.840 --> 53:24.650
and like, you know, a lot of times

53:24.650 --> 53:27.780
he's just like opening for
big bands and stuff like that.

53:27.780 --> 53:29.120
And he sold a couple of songs.

53:29.120 --> 53:31.720
He made a lot of money off
of it, at least at the time

53:31.720 --> 53:35.882
and he was like on the verge of making it.

53:35.882 --> 53:38.370
I mean, at least that's what it seemed.

53:38.370 --> 53:40.920
I mean, it had this great song.

53:40.920 --> 53:45.920
It was about, well, it was, it
was about two bears fucking,

53:47.580 --> 53:51.690
but it was good, it was
really, really good actually.

53:51.690 --> 53:54.400
- He always talked like
he didn't play much.

53:54.400 --> 53:56.000
- There are two kinds of drunks.

53:57.130 --> 54:00.620
You either stop trying or
you haven't started yet.

54:00.620 --> 54:03.163
You're either on the
front end, or the backend.

54:04.166 --> 54:06.773
And me and Neil, we're on the back end.

54:08.050 --> 54:09.557
- [Spoon] What about the
people in the middle?

54:09.557 --> 54:10.773
- Middle of what?

54:12.290 --> 54:13.853
- Living or whatever?

54:17.540 --> 54:18.373
- Cheers.

54:26.210 --> 54:27.190
- No.

54:27.190 --> 54:28.023
Insurmountable.

54:32.204 --> 54:33.037
Jesus.

54:42.065 --> 54:43.571
You all right?

54:43.571 --> 54:45.435
- [Spoon] I just want the cold floor.

54:45.435 --> 54:48.018
(gentle music)

55:04.770 --> 55:06.270
Play me a song that you wrote.

55:10.060 --> 55:13.863
- I told you, I don't
remember any of them.

55:15.010 --> 55:16.260
- [Spoon] You should try.

55:18.810 --> 55:19.643
- Spoon.

55:23.640 --> 55:25.293
I've already done all this stuff.

55:27.860 --> 55:30.870
You know, you get to, you
get to a certain point

55:30.870 --> 55:32.900
and I'm not trying to old man you,

55:32.900 --> 55:35.690
it's just, you reach a
stage in your life where

55:38.149 --> 55:40.230
you just start losing touch with some of

55:41.490 --> 55:43.530
the things that you used to do

55:43.530 --> 55:46.283
and the things that used to matter.

55:52.200 --> 55:54.493
I just don't mind the
idea of disappearing.

55:55.430 --> 55:57.130
But you shouldn't, you know?

55:57.130 --> 56:00.100
You don't need me to go to open mics.

56:00.100 --> 56:01.403
You're good on your own.

56:02.780 --> 56:05.810
- [Spoon] I went to that
showcase thing tonight.

56:05.810 --> 56:06.643
- Good.

56:06.643 --> 56:09.003
- It was fucking stupid, you were right.

56:11.330 --> 56:13.300
Am I allowed to fall asleep
on the floor right now

56:13.300 --> 56:14.323
or is that weird?

56:16.990 --> 56:19.353
- We're going to tilt back this way, okay?

56:20.210 --> 56:22.245
- How you doing Lizzy, feel okay?

56:22.245 --> 56:23.509
- I'm fine.

56:23.509 --> 56:25.699
- Good, that's really good.

56:25.699 --> 56:26.616
- I got ya.

56:27.657 --> 56:28.490
Back.

56:43.640 --> 56:45.990
- [Nelly] I had to look
up the word philistine.

56:49.280 --> 56:51.990
- Probably felt pretty
shitty when you found it.

56:51.990 --> 56:52.823
- Sort of.

56:55.420 --> 56:57.040
I don't mind being that.

56:57.040 --> 56:59.120
It seems to me like I'm the
one who can enjoy the Beatles

56:59.120 --> 57:00.670
and you're the one who can't.

57:00.670 --> 57:02.971
- [Lizzy] Oh, I liked the
Beatles, don't think that I don't

57:02.971 --> 57:04.110
- You just don't like talking about it.

57:04.110 --> 57:06.390
- [Lizzy] Right, you
sound like a dumb fuck

57:06.390 --> 57:08.480
if you talk about how
much you like the Beatles.

57:08.480 --> 57:10.620
- Some people don't care how they sound.

57:10.620 --> 57:12.720
If they like something, they just like it.

57:18.140 --> 57:19.210
Feel good?

57:19.210 --> 57:20.283
- Very funny.

57:29.910 --> 57:32.510
This reminds me of something
that I'm going to miss.

57:33.700 --> 57:35.920
Okay, don't concentrate on me so much.

57:35.920 --> 57:37.423
It's way too dramatic.

57:43.510 --> 57:45.380
I was thinking of that feeling

57:45.380 --> 57:47.540
of tangling your legs with someone else's

57:48.710 --> 57:50.610
or like when you climb into a cold bed

57:52.990 --> 57:55.863
and you move your legs around,
like you're treading water.

57:58.120 --> 58:00.270
Collecting all the
freshness of the sheets.

58:11.810 --> 58:15.403
I guess I never realized
the feeling of my legs.

58:20.150 --> 58:22.410
- How old were you when you first shaved?

58:22.410 --> 58:23.760
- I remember the first time that I shaved

58:23.760 --> 58:25.060
I cut myself really bad.

58:25.060 --> 58:27.200
It was right below the knee, yeah,

58:27.200 --> 58:29.260
and at the same time my dad managed

58:29.260 --> 58:30.930
to call me down for dinner.

58:30.930 --> 58:31.763
I panicked.

58:32.740 --> 58:36.883
I went and I put on sweat
pants and my tall gym socks.

58:37.920 --> 58:39.350
I sat there through dinner.

58:39.350 --> 58:41.220
I remember when we were done eating

58:41.220 --> 58:43.463
my sock was soaked with blood.

58:44.890 --> 58:47.680
Oh God, that wasn't even the worst part.

58:47.680 --> 58:49.530
My dad found the sock in the wash

58:49.530 --> 58:52.920
and he was convinced that
I'd started my period.

58:52.920 --> 58:55.070
So he sat me down to have the tampon talk

58:55.070 --> 58:56.890
for like the hundredth time.

58:56.890 --> 59:00.140
It was so awkward but I did
not have the heart to tell him.

59:00.140 --> 59:01.750
So I would take tampons and wrap them

59:01.750 --> 59:04.360
in toilet paper and then just
throw them in the trashcan.

59:04.360 --> 59:06.220
I didn't start my period
for like two years.

59:06.220 --> 59:08.010
- Where was your mom in all this?

59:08.010 --> 59:09.607
No sisters or anything?

59:09.607 --> 59:12.920
- No, my mom had died the year before.

59:12.920 --> 59:16.760
No sisters, no siblings
really, other then Dennis.

59:16.760 --> 59:18.900
But he's 15 years older,
so he doesn't count.

59:18.900 --> 59:19.820
- Oh yeah.

59:19.820 --> 59:21.470
I met him at the hospital.

59:21.470 --> 59:23.500
- Yeah, Neil said he was there.

59:23.500 --> 59:26.333
He actually left before I
woke up, typical Dennis.

59:33.960 --> 59:35.812
- [Neil] You're moving more
than you were yesterday.

59:35.812 --> 59:37.020
- [Lizzy] Mmhm.

59:37.020 --> 59:37.853
- That's good.

59:39.772 --> 59:42.720
Just, just let me know when
you want me to feed you

59:42.720 --> 59:43.563
and then I'll--

59:43.563 --> 59:45.190
- I don't need you to feed me Neil.

59:45.190 --> 59:48.150
- Well, you do and you're
going to eventually, so just.

59:48.150 --> 59:49.550
- Neil, please stop talking.

59:50.650 --> 59:51.670
I'm trying to concentrate.

59:51.670 --> 59:52.503
- Fine.

1:00:04.540 --> 1:00:05.520
You're going to regret that.

1:00:05.520 --> 1:00:07.024
- No, not me.

1:00:07.024 --> 1:00:08.541
Oh my God, it was so satisfying.

1:00:08.541 --> 1:00:10.030
- You know what, you just stay right there

1:00:10.030 --> 1:00:11.900
for a few years, and
you're going to regret it.

1:00:11.900 --> 1:00:13.390
- That was so satisfying,

1:00:13.390 --> 1:00:16.540
but I have an even better
idea, hold on just one second.

1:00:16.540 --> 1:00:18.740
This is gonna be really perfect.

1:00:18.740 --> 1:00:20.010
There we go.

1:00:20.010 --> 1:00:21.230
- Stop it.

1:00:21.230 --> 1:00:22.887
- Why, that's perfect like that.

1:00:24.370 --> 1:00:25.355
Actually.

1:00:25.355 --> 1:00:26.188
- What?

1:00:27.610 --> 1:00:31.770
- Since you already have some
cereal, I think it needs milk.

1:00:31.770 --> 1:00:32.770
- Stop, no.

1:00:32.770 --> 1:00:33.603
- [Neil] Because.

1:00:33.603 --> 1:00:34.885
- No.

1:00:34.885 --> 1:00:35.718
- [Neil] No, well it'll be dry.

1:00:35.718 --> 1:00:36.551
- No.

1:00:36.551 --> 1:00:37.384
- [Neil] Hold on just.

1:00:37.384 --> 1:00:38.217
Here it comes, ready?

1:00:38.217 --> 1:00:40.660
- Okay, Neil, please stop,
I'm claustrophobic now.

1:00:40.660 --> 1:00:41.493
- [Neil] Three.

1:00:41.493 --> 1:00:42.982
- Neil you fucking asshole, stop, stop it!

1:00:42.982 --> 1:00:43.818
Stop!

1:00:43.818 --> 1:00:45.830
- Hey, hey, hey, relax, relax.

1:00:45.830 --> 1:00:46.663
- Stop.

1:00:46.663 --> 1:00:47.496
- Relax, honey I'm sorry.

1:00:47.496 --> 1:00:48.329
- Stop.

1:00:48.329 --> 1:00:49.730
- I was joking, I'm sorry,

1:00:49.730 --> 1:00:51.860
I didn't realize you wanted
me to stop, I'm sorry.

1:00:51.860 --> 1:00:55.100
- God, I wanna tear my
fucking skin off right now.

1:00:55.100 --> 1:00:57.330
- [Neil] God, we're gonna
need a safe word or something,

1:00:57.330 --> 1:00:59.593
I was playing around, I'm sorry.

1:01:03.190 --> 1:01:04.123
- JonBenét Ramsey.

1:01:07.390 --> 1:01:08.223
- What?

1:01:09.170 --> 1:01:10.320
- That's our safe word.

1:01:11.435 --> 1:01:14.592
(gentle music)

1:01:14.592 --> 1:01:16.134
- You know they say they can see the seams

1:01:16.134 --> 1:01:18.823
of the ball right as it
leaves the pitchers gloves,

1:01:18.823 --> 1:01:20.034
and then these guys and them,

1:01:20.034 --> 1:01:21.434
run right when it bounces off the bat,

1:01:21.434 --> 1:01:25.094
they can where's it's gonna land.

1:01:25.094 --> 1:01:26.402
- Neil did you see that?

1:01:26.402 --> 1:01:28.319
- [Neil] Yeah, I heard.

1:01:29.832 --> 1:01:31.318
- I'm gonna use the bathroom.

1:01:31.318 --> 1:01:33.901
(gentle music)

1:01:41.879 --> 1:01:44.714
- We should go a basketball game to.

1:01:44.714 --> 1:01:46.439
Okay, what are some of the worst teams?

1:01:46.439 --> 1:01:48.916
I only wanna root for the worst team.

1:01:48.916 --> 1:01:50.251
I wanna be a real fan.

1:01:50.251 --> 1:01:52.834
(gentle music)

1:02:51.611 --> 1:02:53.183
(women laughs)

1:02:53.183 --> 1:02:54.016
- Right?

1:02:54.894 --> 1:02:57.317
God, oh my gosh you're so impressive.

1:02:57.317 --> 1:02:58.986
You're gonna be running
for this chair in no time.

1:02:58.986 --> 1:03:01.736
(Lizzy chuckles)

1:03:03.324 --> 1:03:04.157
Hey.

1:03:05.796 --> 1:03:08.354
Have you talked to her yet?

1:03:08.354 --> 1:03:13.354
So Lizzy, Phil is going
to be taking over for me.

1:03:13.500 --> 1:03:15.280
You've been making really great progress

1:03:15.280 --> 1:03:17.250
and we're ready to send you home.

1:03:17.250 --> 1:03:19.270
So you'll be doing intense outpatient

1:03:19.270 --> 1:03:20.790
therapy five days a week.

1:03:20.790 --> 1:03:22.470
And Phil is the guy that's
going to get you ready

1:03:22.470 --> 1:03:25.453
to do that two-step
we've been talking about.

1:03:25.453 --> 1:03:28.160
- [Phil] Hey Lizzy, I hear your mobilizing

1:03:28.160 --> 1:03:29.810
the chair all by yourself already.

1:03:29.810 --> 1:03:31.330
- [Nelly] Yeah, she's
been doing really great.

1:03:31.330 --> 1:03:32.883
You'll be home in no time.

1:03:35.300 --> 1:03:37.883
- Who's going to take me
to the bathroom and stuff?

1:03:39.740 --> 1:03:40.860
- That's going to be transferred over

1:03:40.860 --> 1:03:42.280
to a hospitality nurse.

1:03:42.280 --> 1:03:44.929
You'll meet her when you
get back to the hospital.

1:03:44.929 --> 1:03:46.323
- [Lizzy] Oh, so your?

1:03:48.500 --> 1:03:50.680
Wait, do you do both?

1:03:50.680 --> 1:03:52.440
- Just in the beginning stages.

1:03:52.440 --> 1:03:54.170
You're going to need Phil
to do all the muscle work

1:03:54.170 --> 1:03:56.433
and stuff that you need
before you can go home.

1:03:59.748 --> 1:04:00.581
- Okay.

1:04:01.530 --> 1:04:02.363
Bye.

1:04:03.210 --> 1:04:05.523
- I'll come and check in on
you from time to time, okay?

1:04:07.800 --> 1:04:08.633
- Okay.

1:04:09.900 --> 1:04:13.950
Hey, you know I'm free
tomorrow or whenever.

1:04:13.950 --> 1:04:16.280
- [Phil] Tell me about what some

1:04:16.280 --> 1:04:18.163
of your immediate goals are.

1:04:26.068 --> 1:04:28.191
- Put your weight on it, yes.

1:04:28.191 --> 1:04:29.953
So good, amazing, all right.

1:04:29.953 --> 1:04:31.536
Let's try one more.

1:04:34.830 --> 1:04:36.880
- [Lizzy] And what if there's a fire?

1:04:36.880 --> 1:04:37.880
- This is temporary.

1:04:38.745 --> 1:04:40.084
We're selling the place.

1:04:40.084 --> 1:04:41.007
- [Lizzy] What happened to that picture?

1:04:41.007 --> 1:04:43.323
- Garth and I broke it
moving in the futon.

1:04:44.860 --> 1:04:45.880
Glass everywhere.

1:04:45.880 --> 1:04:47.530
- Like that scene in Mission Impossible?

1:04:47.530 --> 1:04:50.387
- [Neil] Just like that
scene in Mission Impossible.

1:05:14.440 --> 1:05:15.273
- [Woman] You're going to need

1:05:15.273 --> 1:05:17.093
a handicap friendly bathroom Lizzy.

1:05:28.420 --> 1:05:29.270
What's your plan?

1:05:32.710 --> 1:05:33.853
She needs to move.

1:05:34.880 --> 1:05:37.170
There are no amenities here.

1:05:37.170 --> 1:05:38.644
I don't even know how you got
her up here to begin with.

1:05:38.644 --> 1:05:40.010
- Well you know, the hospital didn't do

1:05:40.010 --> 1:05:41.920
a great job explaining timelines to me.

1:05:41.920 --> 1:05:44.273
We're doing the best we can, I don't know.

1:05:45.192 --> 1:05:47.333
- [Woman] She needs to go home.

1:05:47.333 --> 1:05:50.830
- [Neil] This is her home,
there's no where for her to go.

1:05:50.830 --> 1:05:52.280
- No parents, no siblings?

1:05:52.280 --> 1:05:53.173
- Nobody.

1:05:53.173 --> 1:05:54.570
What, do you think I
think this is optimal?

1:05:54.570 --> 1:05:55.863
I don't, okay?

1:05:58.338 --> 1:05:59.755
- God, whatever.

1:06:04.580 --> 1:06:07.163
(gentle music)

1:06:13.700 --> 1:06:14.669
- That's the best we can do.

1:06:14.669 --> 1:06:15.502
- Stop.

1:06:15.502 --> 1:06:18.002
- What do you want, all right.

1:06:21.427 --> 1:06:23.217
I don't know what you want me to do.

1:06:23.217 --> 1:06:24.803
Do you want me to pick you up?

1:06:27.020 --> 1:06:28.231
I can try to pick you up.

1:06:28.231 --> 1:06:29.064
- Stop it.

1:06:29.064 --> 1:06:30.313
- I don't know, what do you want me to do?

1:06:33.300 --> 1:06:35.000
I told you this was a stupid idea.

1:06:43.771 --> 1:06:46.354
(gentle music)

1:06:54.147 --> 1:06:56.480
You want a hot dog or pizza?

1:06:57.350 --> 1:06:58.717
- How much is pizza?

1:06:58.717 --> 1:06:59.612
- Don't be one of those people

1:06:59.612 --> 1:07:02.945
that complains about the price of pizza.

1:07:05.197 --> 1:07:07.197
Or maybe that's hotdogs?

1:07:10.103 --> 1:07:11.660
I'll be right back.

1:07:11.660 --> 1:07:14.243
(gentle music)

1:07:24.700 --> 1:07:26.253
- Um, excuse me, sir.

1:07:27.520 --> 1:07:29.310
I'm sorry, my hands are really gross

1:07:29.310 --> 1:07:30.910
from making sandcastles all day.

1:07:31.805 --> 1:07:33.800
Can you feed me my pretzel?

1:07:33.800 --> 1:07:36.467
(gentle music)

1:08:51.127 --> 1:08:52.127
- God, fuck.

1:09:11.290 --> 1:09:12.940
- Why are we always so miserable?

1:09:17.700 --> 1:09:19.950
It's like, we want to
be miserable, you know?

1:09:21.520 --> 1:09:23.220
Like we want to be noticed for it.

1:09:34.082 --> 1:09:36.332
- We always had each other.

1:09:39.030 --> 1:09:41.143
- That's a very small community Neil.

1:09:46.580 --> 1:09:48.920
But I came back because I
didn't have anyone else.

1:09:48.920 --> 1:09:49.753
- I know.

1:09:53.770 --> 1:09:57.693
- I thought that this, that
this was another adventure.

1:09:58.671 --> 1:10:00.171
That this was another chapter.

1:10:02.550 --> 1:10:04.553
In our endless game of cat and mouse.

1:10:07.200 --> 1:10:09.760
Only this time you'd be
playing the role of the mouse

1:10:09.760 --> 1:10:12.710
and it'd be fucked up if I
didn't play the role of the cat.

1:10:14.232 --> 1:10:17.960
Because it didn't seem fair.

1:10:17.960 --> 1:10:19.680
- God, let's just go to sleep.

1:10:19.680 --> 1:10:22.080
It really doesn't help
to talk about this stuff.

1:10:25.250 --> 1:10:26.900
- What was I supposed to do Neil?

1:10:30.040 --> 1:10:31.350
Just find somebody else

1:10:32.393 --> 1:10:35.603
and teach them to repeat after me?

1:10:54.030 --> 1:10:55.940
- So what do you?

1:10:55.940 --> 1:10:58.090
- Have you ever heard
of the Cardiff giant?

1:10:59.720 --> 1:11:01.110
- No.

1:11:01.110 --> 1:11:03.423
- Some famous upstate New York thing.

1:11:04.890 --> 1:11:07.140
This guy made a fake skeleton of a giant

1:11:07.140 --> 1:11:09.840
and charged people admission to go see it.

1:11:09.840 --> 1:11:11.163
And then PT. Barnum.

1:11:26.251 --> 1:11:28.184
- Will you play me that song?

1:11:28.184 --> 1:11:30.270
The one where the bears fuck each other.

1:11:30.270 --> 1:11:34.580
- [Neil] No, I will not
because we're going upstate.

1:11:36.040 --> 1:11:38.120
I have Garth's car, let's go

1:11:38.120 --> 1:11:39.550
- Where upstate?

1:11:39.550 --> 1:11:40.700
- [Neil] Catskills.

1:11:40.700 --> 1:11:42.200
- That's not upstate.

1:11:42.200 --> 1:11:45.283
- [Neil] Anything over
125th street is upstairs.

1:11:46.430 --> 1:11:50.327
White Plains, upstate,
Yonkers racetrack, upstate.

1:11:50.327 --> 1:11:52.910
(gentle music)

1:12:23.063 --> 1:12:24.682
Just don't go fast.

1:12:24.682 --> 1:12:25.515
- [Lizzy] Okay.

1:12:25.515 --> 1:12:26.348
- [Neil] I don't think these things

1:12:26.348 --> 1:12:27.181
are supposed to go on gravel.

1:12:27.181 --> 1:12:28.300
- [Lizzy] Neil, I'm not going fast.

1:12:28.300 --> 1:12:29.133
- [Neil] Can you turn the wheel,

1:12:29.133 --> 1:12:30.614
let me just put the seatbelt on you.

1:12:30.614 --> 1:12:32.000
- [Lizzy] No.

1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:32.833
- [Neil] There's no reason for us

1:12:32.833 --> 1:12:34.340
not to put the seatbelt on.

1:12:34.340 --> 1:12:36.260
- Neil, I don't need the seatbelt.

1:12:36.260 --> 1:12:39.350
You are entirely way too
stressed out right now.

1:12:39.350 --> 1:12:41.381
- Well I thought I just saw a turtle.

1:12:41.381 --> 1:12:42.970
- Probably didn't.

1:12:42.970 --> 1:12:45.470
I need you to walk a little faster.

1:12:45.470 --> 1:12:47.270
- No, I need you to go a little slower.

1:12:47.270 --> 1:12:48.163
- Just walk.

1:12:49.400 --> 1:12:52.415
What's the point in having this
if I can't have a fun time?

1:12:52.415 --> 1:12:54.998
(gentle music)

1:12:59.122 --> 1:13:00.020
This is probably the fastest

1:13:00.020 --> 1:13:02.673
I'll ever move again in
my life, let's be honest.

1:13:07.520 --> 1:13:08.923
It's pretty quiet up here.

1:13:14.115 --> 1:13:16.200
(Lizzy chuckles)

1:13:16.200 --> 1:13:18.673
Do you remember when we
wanted to move to Berlin?

1:13:21.770 --> 1:13:22.603
- Yeah.

1:13:23.870 --> 1:13:28.260
- Oh God, that was our big,
original Bohemian idea.

1:13:28.260 --> 1:13:31.283
Moving to a city that is
exactly like Brooklyn.

1:13:34.430 --> 1:13:39.173
And we'd eventually just disappear
from this place entirely.

1:13:43.720 --> 1:13:44.553
Remember?

1:13:53.130 --> 1:13:55.430
You've always been
obsessed with disappearing.

1:14:03.127 --> 1:14:07.490
- You never want to be the
last one to leave a party.

1:14:07.490 --> 1:14:08.323
- [Lizzy] Yeah.

1:14:16.900 --> 1:14:20.053
- I'm going to go grill some hotdogs.

1:14:21.100 --> 1:14:22.300
You want to come up or
you want to stay here?

1:14:22.300 --> 1:14:24.610
- No, I'm gonna stay here.

1:15:04.396 --> 1:15:07.146
(dramatic music)

1:15:17.605 --> 1:15:22.605
(dramatic music)
(Neil humming)

1:15:30.543 --> 1:15:33.626
(suspenseful music)

1:15:39.890 --> 1:15:42.031
- Hey, you know Lizzy.

1:15:42.031 --> 1:15:44.517
I don't think we thought this through.

1:15:44.517 --> 1:15:46.323
I don't think you're going to
be able to get back up there.

1:15:46.323 --> 1:15:49.323
(suspenseful music)

1:15:57.344 --> 1:15:58.427
Lizzy, Lizzy!

1:15:59.364 --> 1:16:00.197
Fuck.

1:16:00.197 --> 1:16:01.818
(suspenseful music)

1:16:01.818 --> 1:16:02.901
Lizzy, Lizzy!

1:16:04.507 --> 1:16:07.257
(dramatic music)

1:16:12.135 --> 1:16:14.718
(upbeat music)

1:16:17.103 --> 1:16:17.936
- [Woman] Hey girl it's me.

1:16:17.936 --> 1:16:19.210
Sorry I missed your call.

1:16:19.210 --> 1:16:20.887
I'm on my way, I'll see
you at the bar in a second.

1:16:20.887 --> 1:16:22.617
(upbeat music)

1:16:22.617 --> 1:16:23.517
- Hey!

1:16:23.517 --> 1:16:25.244
- Oh my God, your hair!

1:16:25.244 --> 1:16:27.128
- Yeah, so cute, right?

1:16:27.128 --> 1:16:28.257
- Yeah!

1:16:28.257 --> 1:16:29.561
Oh, two.

1:16:29.561 --> 1:16:32.391
- Oh here it comes, is it vodka?

1:16:32.391 --> 1:16:33.459
- Whiskey.

1:16:33.459 --> 1:16:35.342
- I can't do whiskey.

1:16:35.342 --> 1:16:36.425
- Since when?

1:16:37.804 --> 1:16:39.137
Just do whiskey.

1:16:40.319 --> 1:16:41.152
L'chaim.

1:16:41.152 --> 1:16:43.735
(upbeat music)

1:16:45.630 --> 1:16:46.758
Give me more, more.

1:16:46.758 --> 1:16:47.591
- No way dude.

1:16:47.591 --> 1:16:49.750
You gotta wait a while.

1:16:49.750 --> 1:16:50.583
Let's go dance.

1:16:52.444 --> 1:16:53.325
Come on.

1:16:53.325 --> 1:16:55.908
(upbeat music)

1:17:06.588 --> 1:17:09.421
(dramatic music)

1:17:14.063 --> 1:17:15.930
- [Nelly] One of the
keys is to think about

1:17:15.930 --> 1:17:17.810
the things that used to make you happy.

1:17:17.810 --> 1:17:19.010
What did you like doing?

1:17:20.555 --> 1:17:21.388
- [Lizzy] I liked to listen to music.

1:17:21.388 --> 1:17:22.620
- [Nelly] Oh, did you dance at all?

1:17:22.620 --> 1:17:25.086
- [Lizzy] No, no, I
liked to listen to music,

1:17:25.086 --> 1:17:26.503
I don't dance to it.

1:17:26.503 --> 1:17:27.433
You don't get it.

1:17:27.433 --> 1:17:30.079
- [Nelly] Well it sounds to
me like you can still do that.

1:17:30.079 --> 1:17:33.313
What is something that you
used to do that you can't do?

1:17:35.160 --> 1:17:35.993
- [Lizzy] Drinking.

1:17:35.993 --> 1:17:36.850
- [Nelly] Well that's--

1:17:36.850 --> 1:17:37.830
- [Lizzy] I liked drinking.

1:17:37.830 --> 1:17:39.000
- [Nelly] That's something, being social,

1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:39.833
going out with friends.

1:17:39.833 --> 1:17:42.890
- [Lizzy] No, no, that's
not what I'm talking about.

1:17:42.890 --> 1:17:43.803
I like to drink.

1:17:50.230 --> 1:17:51.063
- You okay?

1:17:54.260 --> 1:17:56.223
- Yeah, it's gonna heal fine.

1:17:57.440 --> 1:18:01.103
- Sometimes it's best
to face grief head on.

1:18:02.300 --> 1:18:05.000
And think about the things
you used to love about her.

1:18:08.150 --> 1:18:10.090
(dramatic music)

1:18:10.090 --> 1:18:12.240
- I just can't wait to finally move.

1:18:12.240 --> 1:18:13.890
I'm actually moving to Coalbrook.

1:18:15.900 --> 1:18:16.910
My real estate agent was saying

1:18:16.910 --> 1:18:18.820
it's basically like the next Brooklyn.

1:18:18.820 --> 1:18:21.990
And everybodies moving there
that's moving out of the city.

1:18:21.990 --> 1:18:24.600
It's like the last stop on the
L train, it's just as cool.

1:18:24.600 --> 1:18:25.700
And just because everybody dresses

1:18:25.700 --> 1:18:27.860
the same doesn't mean they're bad people.

1:18:27.860 --> 1:18:28.693
It's all about connecting.

1:18:28.693 --> 1:18:31.493
It's like yeah, gonna
be the next Brooklyn.

1:18:37.230 --> 1:18:40.303
- [Man] And next up is
Neil, is there a Neil here?

1:18:42.180 --> 1:18:43.013
Neil?

1:18:48.960 --> 1:18:49.793
- Thanks.

1:19:01.840 --> 1:19:03.153
This is an old one.

1:19:03.153 --> 1:19:05.736
(gentle music)

1:19:35.760 --> 1:19:37.180
- So you're gonna be all lame and moody

1:19:37.180 --> 1:19:39.130
and leave New York to go find yourself?

1:19:42.720 --> 1:19:44.563
- Speaking of leaving New York,

1:19:45.619 --> 1:19:47.323
when are you and Sloan taking off?

1:19:49.530 --> 1:19:50.363
- We're not.

1:19:51.430 --> 1:19:53.260
Seems kind of poserish.

1:19:53.260 --> 1:19:54.720
To do touch and goes all over the world

1:19:54.720 --> 1:19:56.410
just so I can say I've been there?

1:19:56.410 --> 1:19:57.263
I'm no tourist.

1:19:58.690 --> 1:19:59.523
And for what?

1:19:59.523 --> 1:20:00.356
Just so I have something to talk about

1:20:00.356 --> 1:20:01.890
to people I don't even care about?

1:20:01.890 --> 1:20:03.980
No one wants to hear
me talk about Yosemite.

1:20:03.980 --> 1:20:06.270
Even if they do it's
just so they can butt in

1:20:06.270 --> 1:20:08.210
and tell me how great it was 20 years ago.

1:20:08.210 --> 1:20:10.560
It's a competition,
traveling is a competition.

1:20:13.410 --> 1:20:16.590
- Yosemite's also just really pretty.

1:20:16.590 --> 1:20:18.690
- See, you couldn't wait
to poke me with that.

1:20:18.690 --> 1:20:20.210
And yet, if I'm in a room with people

1:20:20.210 --> 1:20:24.230
who've lived in Brooklyn for three five,

1:20:24.230 --> 1:20:27.760
seven, nine years, and
I say I'm from here,

1:20:27.760 --> 1:20:29.800
then I've kind of dampen the mood.

1:20:29.800 --> 1:20:30.960
Like the game is over.

1:20:30.960 --> 1:20:32.300
Like I've pulled some kind of trump card,

1:20:32.300 --> 1:20:34.270
now everyone has to wait for me to leave

1:20:34.270 --> 1:20:35.270
so they can talk about how much

1:20:35.270 --> 1:20:36.780
their neighborhood has
changed over the years,

1:20:36.780 --> 1:20:38.540
so they can be a fucking expert.

1:20:38.540 --> 1:20:40.180
Like why does it even matter,
where does this count?

1:20:40.180 --> 1:20:41.300
- Will you stop?

1:20:41.300 --> 1:20:42.220
Just stop.

1:20:46.150 --> 1:20:47.083
I did this.

1:20:52.470 --> 1:20:53.913
I just fucked you to good.

1:20:55.370 --> 1:20:56.773
- You stole my line.

1:20:59.170 --> 1:21:01.087
Doesn't even work right there though.

1:21:11.223 --> 1:21:14.629
(upbeat music)

1:21:14.629 --> 1:21:19.629
♪ There's no two, eight or nine ♪

1:21:20.400 --> 1:21:24.483
♪ To these numbers I am counting ♪

1:21:46.160 --> 1:21:48.010
- [Riley] There wasn't
civilization for miles.

1:21:48.010 --> 1:21:49.903
We ended up having to camp out.

1:22:04.625 --> 1:22:07.125
(door knocks)

1:22:15.220 --> 1:22:16.053
- Hey.

1:22:16.053 --> 1:22:16.886
- [Woman] Hi honey.

1:22:16.886 --> 1:22:19.123
- Hey how's it going?

1:22:21.370 --> 1:22:22.610
I'm Neil.

1:22:22.610 --> 1:22:23.620
I called.

1:22:23.620 --> 1:22:24.803
- 200 for arrival.

1:22:26.710 --> 1:22:27.543
- Okay.

1:22:30.730 --> 1:22:33.059
When you say arrival, you mean it's 200?

1:22:33.059 --> 1:22:34.573
- It's 200 now or I leave.

1:22:36.450 --> 1:22:37.283
- Okay.

1:22:38.270 --> 1:22:39.790
But like anything else that I want

1:22:39.790 --> 1:22:42.070
is extra, is this just like a?

1:22:42.070 --> 1:22:44.513
- Yes, that's how it
works, what do you want?

1:22:48.639 --> 1:22:53.139
- Could you suck my, suck
my, give me like a blow job?

1:22:55.640 --> 1:22:56.480
Please.

1:22:56.480 --> 1:22:57.313
- Pull it out.

1:22:58.705 --> 1:23:01.653
75 with a condom, 100 without.

1:23:03.310 --> 1:23:04.910
- [Neil] You want it right here?

1:23:07.175 --> 1:23:08.478
- 75 or 100?

1:23:08.478 --> 1:23:10.963
- [Neil] Okay, um.

1:23:13.255 --> 1:23:18.255
I think I have, here's 80,
can I get the five back or?

1:23:23.907 --> 1:23:24.740
- Get it hard.

1:23:24.740 --> 1:23:25.863
- [Neil] Just forget it.

1:23:26.950 --> 1:23:29.860
I was kind hoping that you
could help me with that?

1:23:29.860 --> 1:23:31.613
- [Woman] What do you want to have happen?

1:23:31.613 --> 1:23:33.920
- I don't know, something sexual.

1:23:33.920 --> 1:23:38.070
Like could you show, like do something,

1:23:38.070 --> 1:23:40.150
like show me your ass
or something like that?

1:23:40.150 --> 1:23:42.867
- [Woman] It's an extra
50 without underwear.

1:23:42.867 --> 1:23:44.897
- I've just been trying a little and if,

1:23:44.897 --> 1:23:48.670
so if you could just, could
you put your hand on it?

1:23:48.670 --> 1:23:49.503
Is that?

1:23:49.503 --> 1:23:51.260
- That's a hand job, that's an extra 100.

1:23:51.260 --> 1:23:54.300
- That's, all right look

1:23:54.300 --> 1:23:56.933
just give me one second, I'll try to.

1:23:56.933 --> 1:23:58.670
- Well, time is money if you can't

1:23:58.670 --> 1:24:00.620
get it hard right now, I have to leave.

1:24:01.830 --> 1:24:04.075
- Just, is this.

1:24:04.075 --> 1:24:05.378
- Okay, okay.

1:24:05.378 --> 1:24:07.555
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on, hold on.

1:24:07.555 --> 1:24:09.020
No can you just give me like,

1:24:09.020 --> 1:24:10.570
can you give me my blowjob money back?

1:24:10.570 --> 1:24:11.730
- [Woman] No.

1:24:11.730 --> 1:24:12.687
- Stop, you can't just leave.

1:24:12.687 --> 1:24:14.585
- [Woman] And what are you
gonna tell the cops huh?

1:24:14.585 --> 1:24:17.252
- Yeah, this is, mother fucking.

1:24:18.977 --> 1:24:21.560
Okay, that was a mistake, fuck.

1:24:30.967 --> 1:24:33.634
(door buzzing)

1:24:40.277 --> 1:24:41.110
Okay, who are you?

1:24:41.110 --> 1:24:42.430
- I'm with the fucking service let me in.

1:24:42.430 --> 1:24:45.200
- No, no, no, they already sent somebody.

1:24:45.200 --> 1:24:46.410
- I don't give a fuck
if they sent somebody,

1:24:46.410 --> 1:24:48.384
it's 200 dollars just for showing
up, so you have to pay me.

1:24:48.384 --> 1:24:49.680
- No, no, you're not listening.

1:24:49.680 --> 1:24:50.950
- Yes, it's 200 dollars
just for showing up.

1:24:50.950 --> 1:24:53.860
- No, they already sent
an angry person here.

1:24:53.860 --> 1:24:55.528
- I'm getting my fucking money.

1:24:55.528 --> 1:24:57.130
I'm not gonna leave here
without my 200 dollars.

1:24:57.130 --> 1:24:58.200
- Bring your voice down.

1:24:58.200 --> 1:24:59.300
- You want me to bring my guy?

1:24:59.300 --> 1:25:00.133
- No, I don't want you to bring your guy,

1:25:00.133 --> 1:25:01.100
I want you to be reasonable,

1:25:01.100 --> 1:25:02.150
listen, I already paid somebody.

1:25:02.150 --> 1:25:04.234
- Give me my 200 fucking dollars!

1:25:04.234 --> 1:25:05.750
- Okay, okay, shut up, shut up, shut up,

1:25:05.750 --> 1:25:09.473
shut the fuck up, just here take it, take,

1:25:11.650 --> 1:25:15.120
there take the money and just
get out of here and be quiet.

1:25:15.120 --> 1:25:16.163
- Have a good night.

1:25:24.897 --> 1:25:26.175
(door buzzes)

1:25:26.175 --> 1:25:29.008
(dramatic music)

1:25:56.289 --> 1:25:58.872
(gentle music)

1:26:01.888 --> 1:26:04.388
(door buzzes)

1:26:06.345 --> 1:26:07.178
- Hello?

1:26:07.178 --> 1:26:08.800
- Spoon, I need you to come down here.

1:26:08.800 --> 1:26:12.864
Just come down here
and bring some clothes.

1:26:12.864 --> 1:26:14.386
- [Spoon] What the fuck?

1:26:14.386 --> 1:26:16.146
- [Neil] Will you fucking come down here?

1:26:16.146 --> 1:26:17.229
- Okay, damn!

1:26:18.953 --> 1:26:21.270
- [Neil] You said that
if I ever needed you,

1:26:21.270 --> 1:26:22.840
you would come no matter
what was happening

1:26:22.840 --> 1:26:24.210
and I really fucking need you now,

1:26:24.210 --> 1:26:27.703
so can we please just go and
don't ask me any questions.

1:26:29.300 --> 1:26:30.853
I know it's crazy, just please.

1:26:31.960 --> 1:26:33.210
It's my birthday present.

1:26:35.826 --> 1:26:40.826
(gentle music)
(Neil crying)

1:26:47.100 --> 1:26:48.170
Hey, did you bring your bag?

1:26:48.170 --> 1:26:49.733
- Jesus, what the fuck man?

1:26:53.680 --> 1:26:55.240
Come on, stop selling it.

1:26:55.240 --> 1:26:56.731
- I'm not fucking selling it.

1:26:56.731 --> 1:26:57.887
- Come on.

1:26:57.887 --> 1:27:00.470
(gentle music)

1:27:18.740 --> 1:27:19.940
- [Neil] Spoon, wake up.

1:27:21.560 --> 1:27:24.740
Spoon, Spoon, you gotta wake up, okay?

1:27:24.740 --> 1:27:25.573
You gotta drive.

1:27:27.700 --> 1:27:29.790
You gotta drive, I'm gonna get us killed.

1:27:29.790 --> 1:27:31.167
I'm so fucking out of it.

1:27:31.167 --> 1:27:32.800
- [Spoon] Wait, are we there yet?

1:27:32.800 --> 1:27:33.680
- No, we're not there.

1:27:33.680 --> 1:27:35.152
I'm pulling over, you gotta drive.

1:27:35.152 --> 1:27:37.735
(gentle music)

1:27:41.377 --> 1:27:43.460
- You know I can't drive.

1:27:46.770 --> 1:27:48.800
Where, what the fuck, where are we going?

1:27:48.800 --> 1:27:50.368
- [Neil] Spoon, fuck!

1:27:50.368 --> 1:27:52.951
(gentle music)

1:27:59.116 --> 1:27:59.949
- Okay.

1:27:59.949 --> 1:28:02.532
(gentle music)

1:28:52.806 --> 1:28:55.723
(traffic rumbling)

1:29:02.470 --> 1:29:05.262
Is this really what we came out here for?

1:29:05.262 --> 1:29:08.179
(traffic rumbling)

1:29:14.577 --> 1:29:16.363
It's just a big fucking spoon.

1:29:17.373 --> 1:29:20.290
(traffic rumbling)

1:29:32.658 --> 1:29:35.374
- [Neil] I kinda like it.

1:29:35.374 --> 1:29:36.708
- [Spoon] Really?

1:29:36.708 --> 1:29:39.291
(gentle music)

1:30:19.624 --> 1:30:22.207
(upbeat music)

1:30:26.420 --> 1:30:31.420
♪ The patterns in the ceiling
can be ever so revealing ♪

1:30:31.923 --> 1:30:36.923
♪ Once I saw these two
bears fuck each other ♪

1:30:37.613 --> 1:30:42.613
♪ Once I saw the weaver pull
over of my dead grandma ♪

1:30:43.143 --> 1:30:43.976
