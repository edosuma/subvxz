WEBVTT

00:15.440 --> 00:17.440
All right.

00:47.080 --> 00:49.080
Let's go.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.160
Here.

01:12.360 --> 01:13.720
Hannah.

01:13.760 --> 01:16.360
Don't.
Hannah, please...please.

01:23.720 --> 01:25.720
Mummy.

01:25.760 --> 01:27.640
What have you done?

01:59.560 --> 02:01.400
This is what's really interesting.

02:01.440 --> 02:03.920
There were Celtic tribes who
used to make this exact journey

02:03.960 --> 02:06.920
thousands of years ago for ritual
and trading purposes...

02:06.960 --> 02:10.640
Is that interesting?
Yes, very interesting, actually.

02:10.680 --> 02:13.360
Just to think that on this exact road
that we're travelling on

02:13.400 --> 02:16.280
right now, there where hundreds...
You are such a history teacher.

02:16.320 --> 02:19.040
Which is why you love me.
That's NOT why I love you.

02:19.080 --> 02:23.160
Well, why then? It is...
Oh, it's my sexy dancing, isn't it?

02:27.840 --> 02:30.840
We will still go dancing, won't we?
Yeah, of course we will.

02:30.880 --> 02:32.880
Ooh.

02:34.560 --> 02:36.560
Hi, Mary-Ann.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.080
OK, yeah, sure. We're on our way.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.080
We can pick up the keys.

02:50.720 --> 02:52.720
# Rolling with the times

02:54.240 --> 02:56.240
# Don't be late

02:58.040 --> 03:00.600
# Rolling with the times

03:01.920 --> 03:03.920
# Don't be late... #

03:11.360 --> 03:14.800
This one's Katherine Kangaroo,

03:14.840 --> 03:18.080
and this one's Dottie.

03:18.120 --> 03:20.520
This is Pablo the Penguin,

03:20.560 --> 03:23.920
this one is Miriam the Magic Girl...

03:26.240 --> 03:30.360
And this is Lazy Mary,
she's asleep all the time.

03:31.520 --> 03:33.920
This is Eunice the Unicorn.

03:34.640 --> 03:39.440
This one is Miss Smilla
and this is Sadie Spider.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.520
And this one is Brian the Lion.

03:43.920 --> 03:46.560
Thank you for introducing me
to your friends.

03:46.600 --> 03:49.520
And your mummy tells me that
when you go to bed it's very

03:49.560 --> 03:53.480
important that all your friends
line up in exactly that order.

03:53.520 --> 03:55.520
Is that right?

03:56.320 --> 03:58.760
And if one gets lost...

03:59.000 --> 04:01.960
In the car maybe, or behind the sofa?

04:03.600 --> 04:05.600
Then I find it.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.400
And if you can't find it?

04:08.440 --> 04:10.440
Then Mummy finds it.

04:11.240 --> 04:13.240
And if mummy can't find it?

04:15.720 --> 04:17.720
Then I can't sleep.

04:18.600 --> 04:20.600
And why can't you sleep?

04:23.200 --> 04:26.240
Because bad things will happen.

04:30.440 --> 04:34.000
Charlotte, I have that
feeling too sometimes.

04:34.640 --> 04:37.080
And that's when
I have to be very brave.

04:38.320 --> 04:41.880
I want you to be brave for me
this weekend.

04:41.920 --> 04:43.600
You're going away to your granny's.

04:44.440 --> 04:47.840
And I want you to leave one of your
friends here in Midwich with me.

04:49.160 --> 04:50.640
And in return

04:50.680 --> 04:55.920
I promise to do my very best to make
sure nothing bad will happen.

04:59.240 --> 05:01.240
Do you think you can do that?

05:06.960 --> 05:08.960
Have a great weekend.

05:23.160 --> 05:25.280
Cassie?

05:25.320 --> 05:27.320
I've finished.

05:30.760 --> 05:32.760
Want a tea, love?

05:45.920 --> 05:48.080
You've remembered
I'm going up to London tonight?

05:49.520 --> 05:51.520
Yeah, I know.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.520
"The date".

05:54.800 --> 05:56.800
You'll be alone for a few hours.

05:58.920 --> 06:02.840
How do you feel about that?
Mum... Therapy language...

06:04.920 --> 06:08.600
"She's learning all the skills she'll
need to become the perfect predator."

06:10.080 --> 06:13.040
I give you your happiness.

06:13.080 --> 06:15.280
Thanks, Mary-Ann. For everything.

06:15.320 --> 06:17.440
Don't do what most people do and
become strangers

06:17.480 --> 06:19.840
just because you've bought. Promise?
We promise.

06:19.880 --> 06:22.800
Come over for a glass of wine
sometime. Oh, I don't drink.

06:22.840 --> 06:23.840
Oh.

06:23.880 --> 06:25.880
Yes, we do irony here too, darling.

06:25.920 --> 06:28.440
I'd better get that.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.920
Case

06:31.720 --> 06:35.040
Yes, Mr Harrison. I got your email.

06:35.080 --> 06:36.640
Of course.

06:37.400 --> 06:39.000
One more thing.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.520
When you walk through your front
door, go in backwards.

06:41.560 --> 06:43.520
It's Midwich good luck.

06:43.560 --> 06:45.560
Bye.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.720
Only sixth?
Shut up!

07:26.760 --> 07:30.360
Have a great weekend.
Say hi to Granny for me.

07:30.400 --> 07:32.400
Bye, Daddy.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.400
You first.

08:10.000 --> 08:12.720
"For many years, scientists..."

08:16.600 --> 08:19.160
You didn't come in backwards.
Oh, come on.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.880
Oh, Mr Clyde. What have you done?

08:47.920 --> 08:50.000
Jane, sorry to bother you.

08:50.040 --> 08:53.040
Erm, Sue's not well, and the new
teacher from London's not starting

08:53.080 --> 08:56.920
until Monday. I'm afraid we're one
short for night duty tonight...

08:56.960 --> 09:00.280
Sure, I can stay.
I'm not ruining any plans?

09:02.200 --> 09:04.640
I'll need to fetch Tilly from home.
Is that OK?

09:04.680 --> 09:06.680
Of course. Thanks a bunch.

09:10.720 --> 09:12.720
"Thanks a bunch"?

10:03.560 --> 10:06.000
"And that was
your four o'clock news bulletin.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.120
Now it's time for the weather
with Sally.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.720
How are things looking out there,
Sally?" "Thanks, Mark..."

10:15.200 --> 10:17.280
Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!

10:20.640 --> 10:22.640
Hey!
Hey!

10:23.240 --> 10:25.240
Come in.
Oh.

10:32.040 --> 10:33.600
What?

10:34.400 --> 10:37.000
You can have one glass of wine,
can't you?

10:37.040 --> 10:39.440
You trying to kill it already?

10:42.560 --> 10:44.600
Sorry I'm late.
I had a nightmare getting here.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.240
There was an hour delay
on the train.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.960
And then your local traffic lights
went AWOL

10:49.000 --> 10:51.440
and they almost wiped out
a perfect nuclear family.

10:51.480 --> 10:54.040
I don't think they want me
in this town.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.880
They set traps.

10:55.920 --> 10:58.200
Yeah, we had a local
meeting about it actually.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.000
How to keep Jodie Blake
out of Midwich.

11:00.040 --> 11:02.040
I bet you did too.

11:07.920 --> 11:11.080
I reckon London.
South or North?

11:11.720 --> 11:13.720
South.

11:15.000 --> 11:16.800
Battersea maybe.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.600
Nah.

11:18.640 --> 11:22.280
They're too cool for Battersea.
As if you'd know.

11:23.960 --> 11:26.520
They thought
they liked the smell of the city.

11:26.560 --> 11:28.560
Until it started to stink.

11:30.960 --> 11:33.320
Come on, sunshine,
let's get you fed.

11:34.280 --> 11:39.120
It's so great. It needs work
but that's what we wanted.

11:39.160 --> 11:41.160
You must come soon.

11:45.040 --> 11:47.480
Yeah, he's really happy.

11:47.520 --> 11:49.520
He starts at the school on Monday.

11:56.880 --> 11:59.240
This was my idea, Mum.

11:59.280 --> 12:01.960
I needed a new environment...

12:03.120 --> 12:06.040
and all the evidence says getting
out of the city can help.

12:08.080 --> 12:11.480
Look, maybe you should accept that
I actually want to be here.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.080
And I also chose him.

12:15.120 --> 12:17.480
Maybe it's
time to deal with that too.

12:26.560 --> 12:29.360
Listen, Mum, I've got to unpack.
I'll call you later.

12:32.160 --> 12:34.160
Love you too.

12:52.360 --> 12:53.600
Hey.

12:53.640 --> 12:55.840
Is she OK?
Yeah. She sends love.

12:55.880 --> 12:58.880
And yes, we are keeping her clock.
Not in the bedroom.

12:58.920 --> 13:00.920
Not in the bedroom. Please.

13:00.960 --> 13:04.000
Landing? I just need to show it
when she comes.

13:04.040 --> 13:07.080
Ah, deal.
Put a light on, would you?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.000
Shh. Tilly.

13:54.440 --> 13:56.680
All right, Mitchell,
what the hell is going on?

13:56.720 --> 13:59.760
I've got terrified old ladies
telling me we're at war.

13:59.800 --> 14:02.720
So we're getting intermittent power
from Kilmorey Avenue

14:02.760 --> 14:06.520
right across Beynon Grove,
to the school,

14:06.560 --> 14:10.600
the riding stables, Hatchfield
in the East, Baker Lane in the South.

14:10.640 --> 14:14.120
So outages followed by random
pulses, all unpredictable.

14:14.160 --> 14:16.360
You checked the sub-stations?

14:16.400 --> 14:19.040
Three times. No faults.
All the arrestors are operational.

14:19.080 --> 14:21.080
So what is it?

14:21.760 --> 14:24.080
I honestly don't know.

14:24.120 --> 14:26.120
Great bloody use you are.

14:27.600 --> 14:31.200
Hiya. Sorry, just got your messages.
We were talking.

14:31.240 --> 14:33.600
"That's all right. How is she?"

14:33.640 --> 14:35.640
Steve's left her.

14:36.240 --> 14:38.960
For good this time.
Oh, I can't say I'm surprised.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.120
"Yeah, well, she's drunk
a vat of wine already."

14:41.160 --> 14:43.440
I think she should
probably stay the night.

14:45.040 --> 14:46.840
Yeah, that's a great idea.

14:47.480 --> 14:49.200
"Listen, I'm gonna be here
for a while.

14:49.240 --> 14:51.200
I need to write a report
on all this.

14:51.240 --> 14:54.200
Do you need anything else?
It's a power cut, Paul.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.360
We'll be fine.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.280
Course you will.

14:58.320 --> 15:00.320
I love you.

15:03.560 --> 15:05.560
Yeah...

15:08.200 --> 15:11.040
Right, Mitchell. If it's not your
wiring, what the bloody hell is it?

15:20.160 --> 15:22.960
There are candles in the living room
drawer if you need them.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.760
Eat whatever you like. Order a pizza
if they're still delivering.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.960
Don't use the freezer just in case.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.280
Trains are running, are they?

15:31.320 --> 15:35.640
Yeah. It seems so, it's like it's
just our area that's out, so...

15:36.920 --> 15:38.520
You look good.

15:38.560 --> 15:40.480
Hope he's worth it.

15:40.520 --> 15:41.840
He won't be.

15:41.880 --> 15:45.040
No, well, if you don't go
then you'll never know.

15:52.040 --> 15:54.520
Got my phone. So any problems,
just call.

15:54.560 --> 15:56.880
OK? I'll come straight back.

15:58.880 --> 16:00.880
You're going to miss your train.

16:01.800 --> 16:03.640
OK.

16:03.680 --> 16:05.720
Bye.

16:17.840 --> 16:19.120
Mum?

17:17.280 --> 17:19.280
They're away for the whole weekend.

17:22.960 --> 17:25.000
How long has it been like this?

17:25.040 --> 17:27.000
A couple of hours.

17:27.040 --> 17:29.240
Wouldn't happen under my watch.

17:29.280 --> 17:32.520
Stewart, this is weird,
why can't we go to a hotel?

17:32.560 --> 17:36.000
Because if anyone sees us
at a hotel, we'd look guilty.

17:36.040 --> 17:38.360
We are guilty.
Oh, nonsense.

17:39.160 --> 17:40.920
We are just...

17:41.840 --> 17:44.880
having a campaign meeting.

18:02.240 --> 18:04.960
I don't know...

18:07.120 --> 18:10.080
"You're a teenager.
You're meant to go to parties.

18:10.120 --> 18:12.400
We'll be there from the start,
we'll look after you."

18:12.440 --> 18:14.440
OK.

18:15.240 --> 18:17.920
"So you'll come?"
All right, maybe...

18:17.960 --> 18:19.160
"Yay."

18:19.200 --> 18:23.000
Nine pm. "Bring your headphones." OK.
"See you there." Bye.

18:25.360 --> 18:26.680
Hey.

18:26.720 --> 18:28.720
Hey.

18:29.560 --> 18:30.840
Hey.

19:10.680 --> 19:12.680
Is someone awake up here?

19:20.600 --> 19:22.480
George?

19:32.480 --> 19:34.840
This reminds me
of camping in Bodmin.

19:34.880 --> 19:38.080
Oh, Jesus. Never again.
You loved it.

19:38.120 --> 19:39.880
All I remember was going down on you

19:39.920 --> 19:42.200
while rain dripped
relentlessly on my head.

19:47.720 --> 19:50.800
It was true what
I said to my mum on the phone.

19:50.840 --> 19:53.280
I wasn't listening.

19:53.320 --> 19:55.680
Yeah, you were.

19:55.720 --> 20:00.040
Yeah, I was.
I chose you, Mr Clyde.

20:02.480 --> 20:04.480
To new beginnings.

20:06.160 --> 20:08.840
New beginnings.
And to our family.

20:08.880 --> 20:10.560
If and when.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.360
If and when.

21:39.160 --> 21:41.160
# PA SALIEU: "Frontline"

21:45.880 --> 21:47.880
I'm really pleased for you, Debs.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.600
I know I used to take the piss
out of you for being all safe.

21:51.640 --> 21:54.040
But look at you.

21:54.920 --> 21:56.880
Great house.

21:56.920 --> 21:58.320
Decent man.

21:58.360 --> 22:01.240
I thought you said he was
a "thick-as-shit Northern twat".

22:01.280 --> 22:06.480
Yeah, well, he's that too.
But he makes my sister happy so...

22:06.520 --> 22:09.120
Yeah, he does make me happy.
He really does.

22:09.160 --> 22:12.280
Yeah, and that's no mean feat.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.120
It'll happen for you.

22:25.680 --> 22:29.760
Hello, sweetheart. This is your
crazy Auntie Jodie out here.

22:31.120 --> 22:33.280
And you don't know
how lucky you are.

22:35.760 --> 22:37.760
It's a boy.

22:38.200 --> 22:40.400
A boy.

22:40.440 --> 22:43.240
Oh, my God, you're a boy. A boy.

24:10.280 --> 24:12.280
Hi, Ryan?

24:12.880 --> 24:14.640
Yeah.

24:14.680 --> 24:16.680
I need something. What have you got?

25:22.280 --> 25:24.240
What the hell!

25:26.720 --> 25:29.200
Where are the fucking curtains!

25:34.880 --> 25:37.120
What's going on?
It's fine. Go back to bed.

25:37.160 --> 25:39.640
"Hi, this is Paul Haynes,
leave your message after the beep."

25:39.680 --> 25:42.000
Hi, Paul, it's me.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.920
It's gonna sound a bit weird
but the lights are on again

25:44.960 --> 25:46.280
and now they won't turn off.

25:57.480 --> 25:59.480
Back to bed, George.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.680
George?

26:03.960 --> 26:05.640
George?!

28:31.600 --> 28:33.600
She won't talk to me about it,
to be honest.

28:33.640 --> 28:35.480
I think she's in denial.

28:35.520 --> 28:40.080
I mean it's been two years, of
course we're gonna see other people.

28:40.120 --> 28:43.240
I think she just likes to maintain
surveillance.

28:43.280 --> 28:44.960
And what about your children?

28:45.000 --> 28:47.720
Oh, I don't know.
I think they're all right about it.

28:47.760 --> 28:52.960
Maisie's in Exeter, constantly
in love and unhappy with the course.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.720
And Tommy's younger. But he's fine.

28:57.200 --> 29:00.960
He was born under an angel's wing.
Mmm. That's rare these days.

29:01.000 --> 29:02.600
So I hear.

29:02.640 --> 29:04.920
No, it's...it's unnerving.

29:05.280 --> 29:08.160
Now I have kids as young as six

29:08.200 --> 29:10.840
coming to me
dreaming of terrible violence.

29:10.880 --> 29:14.760
Men attacking them with knives.
And buildings falling.

29:15.400 --> 29:18.640
There's a...a wave of anxiety
crippling our young

29:18.680 --> 29:20.680
and we're not doing enough about it.

29:21.400 --> 29:23.960
I bet you're very good
at what you do.

29:25.720 --> 29:27.720
I bet you are too.

29:27.760 --> 29:30.640
Well, I'm good at winning
if that's what you mean.

29:32.680 --> 29:35.920
So have you dated many men
in Midwich?

29:35.960 --> 29:40.280
Not really. Er, there's a bit of
a limited selection.

29:40.320 --> 29:43.920
And, er, and then I always worry,
what if they know one of my patients?

29:43.960 --> 29:46.920
So it's best to...
to keep a separation.

29:48.040 --> 29:49.840
It's a long way to come though.

29:50.680 --> 29:53.120
Well, I don't do it very often.

29:53.160 --> 29:55.160
I might take that as a compliment.

29:56.160 --> 30:00.440
Look, I was wondering...
do you have to go back tonight?

30:00.480 --> 30:04.800
I thought we could
walk through the city together.

30:04.840 --> 30:07.320
And I have a very good bottle
of whisky back at home

30:07.360 --> 30:09.360
that does need finishing.

30:10.200 --> 30:12.880
That's very flattering, Michael.

30:12.920 --> 30:16.360
But, erm, it's not really possible.

30:18.440 --> 30:20.680
Your daughter.
Yes.

30:20.720 --> 30:22.960
I think I mentioned on...
on my message.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.800
How old is she?

30:24.840 --> 30:27.640
Well, she's 23,
but that's not really the point.

30:28.400 --> 30:30.600
Cassie has, er...

30:31.280 --> 30:32.920
she has some issues.

30:32.960 --> 30:35.880
She tried to live on her own but
it didn't really work.

30:35.920 --> 30:38.000
So now she's...
Back in the nest.

30:38.040 --> 30:39.880
Yeah.

30:39.920 --> 30:42.200
I need to look after her
a bit at the moment.

30:42.240 --> 30:45.000
At some point you'll have
to confront that, you know.

30:47.160 --> 30:50.080
Yeah, maybe... Come on. Kids'll push
things as far as they can.

30:50.120 --> 30:51.800
They need firm boundaries.

30:54.680 --> 30:59.160
Well, thank you, I'll consider that
advice for the future.

31:04.640 --> 31:06.480
Right, well, er...

31:06.520 --> 31:09.320
Erm, sorry, I think there's a 10:40.

31:09.360 --> 31:11.920
So I should...I should probably...
Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

31:11.960 --> 31:14.520
Erm, so could we get the bill,
please?

31:16.120 --> 31:18.160
Er, Michael.
Don't take this the wrong way.

31:18.200 --> 31:22.400
But, er, perhaps you also need time
to think about your relationship

31:22.440 --> 31:25.000
with your ex-wife.
Because I don't think that that's

31:25.040 --> 31:27.280
as resolved as you claim.

31:35.720 --> 31:38.240
"Hi, you've reached Cassie's phone.

31:38.280 --> 31:39.960
Leave a message
and I'll get back to you."

31:40.000 --> 31:42.480
Listen, darling, it's me.
I'm on my way back.

31:42.520 --> 31:44.520
It was nice.

31:44.560 --> 31:47.400
Er, give me a call,
let me know you're OK.

31:47.440 --> 31:49.840
"This is a customer announcement.

31:49.880 --> 31:53.040
We're sorry to inform you that all
services towards Aylesbury

31:53.080 --> 31:54.800
and High Wycombe have been cancelled.

31:54.840 --> 31:57.960
This is due to a power failure
in the Midwich area.

31:58.000 --> 32:00.960
All customers are advised to seek
alternative transport.

32:01.000 --> 32:03.840
We apologise for any inconvenience
this may cause you."

32:06.200 --> 32:09.320
"Hi, you've reached Cassie's phone.

32:09.360 --> 32:11.520
Leave a message
and I'll get back to you."

32:37.320 --> 32:41.200
"What we do know is that the town of
Midwich has been sealed off.

32:41.240 --> 32:46.280
No one is going in and as far as
we can see no one is coming out.

32:46.320 --> 32:49.520
Normally by now we would
have messages on social media,

32:49.560 --> 32:52.840
we'd have footage from people's
phones." Is Daddy there?

32:52.880 --> 32:54.920
Something to tell us what was
happening - It's OK -

32:54.960 --> 32:57.320
inside the area affected."
It's OK. Shh.

32:57.360 --> 32:59.840
"But tonight there is
nothing whatsoever

32:59.880 --> 33:04.000
coming from inside the area. And that
has to be of slight concern."

33:04.040 --> 33:06.160
"Hi, you've reached Cassie's phone.

33:06.200 --> 33:08.200
Leave a message
and I'll get back to you."

33:16.520 --> 33:19.200
What's going on?
Looks like no way through.

33:21.280 --> 33:23.320
I'm, er...

33:23.360 --> 33:25.280
I'm gonna jump out here.

33:25.320 --> 33:26.800
OK.

33:35.440 --> 33:37.280
Excuse me.

33:37.320 --> 33:40.800
Um, I live in Midwich.
There's no entry at the moment.

33:40.840 --> 33:44.040
If you could turn your vehicle round
and go back to Warham, park up.

33:44.080 --> 33:46.720
Then go straight to the village hall
and wait there. Until when?

33:46.760 --> 33:48.640
We hope to have
more information soon.

33:48.680 --> 33:52.400
I have a daughter.
She's home on her own.

33:52.440 --> 33:54.680
How old is she?

33:54.720 --> 33:56.520
Well, it...it's not about her age.

33:56.560 --> 33:59.240
She...she has health issues.

33:59.280 --> 34:01.800
If you head to Warham village hall
you'll be looked after there.

34:01.840 --> 34:04.160
There's no entry to the town
at present.

34:06.160 --> 34:08.640
Well, can you at least
tell me what's happened?!

35:25.720 --> 35:27.880
Cassie, darling, it's Mum again.

35:27.920 --> 35:29.920
Call me back.

36:26.800 --> 36:28.680
Hey! You!

36:28.720 --> 36:30.720
You shouldn't be here!

36:52.360 --> 36:54.360
Sir. London's sent someone.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.040
DCI Paul Haynes.

37:01.080 --> 37:03.080
Bryony Cummings.
Come through.

37:04.480 --> 37:08.160
The military have sent hazard units
from Aldershot and Porton Down.

37:08.200 --> 37:12.040
SO-fifteen are also on their way.
I've set up roadblocks outside town,

37:12.080 --> 37:14.440
and a cordon around the affected
zone itself.

37:14.480 --> 37:17.400
How many people in the town?
11,000.

37:18.360 --> 37:20.360
And the affected area?

37:21.120 --> 37:23.200
A few hundred. Maybe.

37:23.240 --> 37:25.640
We're gonna get more precise data.

37:26.920 --> 37:28.760
It seems to be
centred around the prep school.

37:28.800 --> 37:32.000
Three or four streets of family
houses, a small estate,

37:32.040 --> 37:34.040
and the riding stables.
Hmm.

37:35.840 --> 37:39.960
Since 9:47pm we've had a complete
blackout, no communication

37:40.000 --> 37:45.440
possible in or out, anyone trying to
get in falls instantly unconscious.

37:47.200 --> 37:49.600
Sorry. What do you mean,
unconscious?

37:57.000 --> 38:00.920
Visible bodies. We can't reach 'em
but we've eyes on 'em.

38:00.960 --> 38:02.960
Are they dead or alive?

38:04.520 --> 38:05.880
We don't know.

38:05.920 --> 38:08.880
No mobile signals. No GPS.

38:10.360 --> 38:13.160
I sent a small UAV over.
But it picked up nothing.

38:13.200 --> 38:14.920
Show me.

38:21.200 --> 38:23.200
Something's blocking the infra-red,

38:24.080 --> 38:26.080
we've got no idea what it is.

38:28.680 --> 38:31.400
Anything you're not telling me,
Miss Cummings?

38:32.600 --> 38:35.280
Sir, we've got another body passed
out right on the edge of the zone.

38:35.320 --> 38:37.320
You should see this.

38:42.920 --> 38:44.920
Come on!

38:52.320 --> 38:55.320
Pulse normal. What's your name?

38:55.360 --> 38:57.360
Dr Susannah Zellaby...

38:58.160 --> 39:00.160
It's OK, I know her.

39:00.960 --> 39:02.960
Dr Zellaby? DCI Paul Haynes.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.520
We met last year.

39:04.560 --> 39:09.440
Yeah, I...I know your wife.
You, er, you live on Clemency Drive.

39:10.120 --> 39:12.240
Could you get her a hot drink,
please? Yeah.

39:12.280 --> 39:14.280
Thank you.

39:15.720 --> 39:18.400
Dr Zellaby, my name's
Bryony Cummings.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.400
I'm from the Home Office.

39:20.440 --> 39:22.120
I'd like to ask...

39:22.160 --> 39:24.160
How did it feel when you fell?

39:24.920 --> 39:25.920
Erm,

39:27.080 --> 39:29.600
well, I, er,

39:29.640 --> 39:34.920
I remember running.
And then I, then I think...

39:34.960 --> 39:36.960
I felt...

39:38.760 --> 39:40.040
lightness...

39:41.480 --> 39:43.800
And dizziness.

39:46.720 --> 39:48.720
It was very quiet.

39:49.360 --> 39:51.640
Well, listen, the guys are gonna
take you for tests.

39:51.680 --> 39:53.360
Get you warmed up, OK.
No. My daughter,

39:53.400 --> 39:56.360
I need to know if she's all right.
We can't get in there at the moment.

39:56.400 --> 39:59.360
She's vulnerable.
I'm worried about her.

39:59.400 --> 40:01.200
I understand.

40:01.240 --> 40:03.640
But we can't do anything.
Not at the moment.

40:04.640 --> 40:07.240
Take her, please,
make sure she's well looked after.

40:28.520 --> 40:30.520
Careful.

40:35.240 --> 40:37.240
Your wife's in there?

40:38.080 --> 40:40.080
Her sister's with her.

40:41.240 --> 40:43.240
Have you heard anything?

40:53.520 --> 40:56.760
"Hi, Paul, it's me.
Erm, it's gonna sound a bit weird.

40:56.800 --> 40:59.520
But the lights are on again
and now they won't turn off.

40:59.560 --> 41:01.720
I'm a bit scared.

41:01.760 --> 41:03.920
Would you just come home..."

41:26.480 --> 41:29.760
"We still have no news as
to the fate of those inside

41:29.800 --> 41:31.600
the Midwich blackout.

41:31.640 --> 41:35.560
With every passing minute,
uncertainty only increases.

41:35.600 --> 41:39.360
The zone affected remains
sealed off as military

41:39.400 --> 41:42.120
and police work tirelessly to find
out what happened."

42:07.160 --> 42:10.000
DCI Haynes? John Lancaster.
SO-fifteen commander.

42:10.040 --> 42:12.760
I have your Incident Response Report.
Good job on the cordon.

42:12.800 --> 42:14.360
But we'll take it from here.

42:14.400 --> 42:16.800
Well, given how little we know
I'd like to recommend a phased

42:16.840 --> 42:19.360
evacuation of the rest of the town.
Not yet.

42:19.400 --> 42:21.200
We're gonna work out what this is.

42:21.240 --> 42:23.560
Get your team onto the local
population outside the zone,

42:23.600 --> 42:27.240
knock on doors,
keep them in their homes.

42:27.280 --> 42:29.760
What's happening there?

42:29.800 --> 42:31.240
Sending an NPAS team up.

42:31.280 --> 42:34.000
I sent a drone up earlier,
it couldn't see anything.

42:34.880 --> 42:36.880
Excuse me.

42:42.440 --> 42:45.320
Mission is to identify any hostile
presence.

42:45.360 --> 42:48.320
If there are live bodies within the
zone, maintain height of 1,200ft

42:48.360 --> 42:51.960
until we can verify the extent to
which they may be armed.

43:18.320 --> 43:20.320
What is it?

43:21.840 --> 43:23.840
They shouldn't be up there.

43:34.600 --> 43:36.600
"India One One. Sit rep?"

43:39.120 --> 43:41.800
Nothing, sir.
Something's blocking the signal.

43:46.200 --> 43:49.440
India One One zero.
Descend for eyes on, over.

43:49.480 --> 43:51.480
"Roger, Wilko."

44:05.400 --> 44:07.400
Still can't see anything, sir.

44:10.200 --> 44:14.240
Should we return to base, sir?
No. Go in closer.

44:14.960 --> 44:16.760
Go in closer, India One One, over?

44:23.560 --> 44:25.560
1,000.

44:27.800 --> 44:30.760
"950. I have a visual, sir.

44:32.920 --> 44:34.920
"900."

44:37.440 --> 44:39.440
850.

44:41.880 --> 44:45.200
CO-PILOT: "I can see something.
I can see bodies, sir."

44:52.200 --> 44:54.920
India One One, climb.
Climb immediately.

45:02.720 --> 45:05.600
"India One One, respond."

45:05.640 --> 45:07.640
"India One One, respond."

45:27.200 --> 45:29.200
India One One, respond.
India One One, respond.

45:48.960 --> 45:50.280
"Hi, this is Deborah.

45:50.320 --> 45:52.880
Sorry I can't take your call right
now but leave a message

45:52.920 --> 45:55.160
and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can."

46:04.760 --> 46:06.280
Deborah...

46:06.320 --> 46:09.040
my wife. She's, erm, she's pregnant.

46:11.320 --> 46:14.560
Do your team know?
It's been a while.

46:14.600 --> 46:16.920
So we thought we'd keep it
to ourselves for a bit.

46:16.960 --> 46:18.960
But I'm worried about her.

46:21.560 --> 46:23.120
We'll get her out.

46:23.160 --> 46:26.000
"Implement phased
evacuation of all areas of the town

46:26.040 --> 46:28.680
as per emergency plan 243."

46:28.720 --> 46:31.120
Ladies and gentlemen,
we're evacuating this area.

46:31.160 --> 46:33.160
Please make your way outside, now!

46:37.840 --> 46:39.720
Excuse me. Excuse me.

46:39.760 --> 46:41.880
What's going on?
Full evacuation.

46:41.920 --> 46:44.960
Where are you taking them?
We have various out-of-town hotels

46:45.000 --> 46:47.640
and conference centres on stand-by.
You should join them, madam.

46:51.880 --> 46:54.760
Sarah?
What's going on?

46:54.800 --> 46:58.560
They're evacuating everybody
but they can't get to our area.

46:58.600 --> 47:01.480
I just drove back from my mother's.
I can't get Stewart on the phone.

47:01.520 --> 47:03.200
Listen, please.
It's OK.

47:03.240 --> 47:06.680
We're going to be moving everyone
out to the perimeter of the town.

47:06.720 --> 47:09.280
Everyone onto the buses
where you'll be registered

47:09.320 --> 47:12.840
and given a temporary permit for
residence in local accommodation.

47:12.880 --> 47:16.080
Well, what do we do?
Move along, please. Let's go!

47:16.120 --> 47:17.760
Move along please.

47:17.800 --> 47:20.520
I'm not going anywhere until I know
about Cassie. Let's go.

47:20.560 --> 47:23.680
This is an enforced evacuation under
police and military command. No.

47:23.720 --> 47:27.320
I'm not going anywhere. Get on
the buses! Get your hands off me!

47:27.360 --> 47:29.640
Put the bloody guns away!

47:30.920 --> 47:32.720
Get back!

47:32.760 --> 47:34.760
Get back!

47:37.680 --> 47:39.120
Wait!

47:47.200 --> 47:49.200
Cassie?

48:00.240 --> 48:01.560
Mum?

48:02.880 --> 48:04.720
Mum, where are you?

48:06.000 --> 48:08.400
Hello?

48:10.000 --> 48:12.360
I'm here, baby.

48:12.400 --> 48:14.400
I'm here.

48:24.520 --> 48:26.800
Mum, I need you!

48:54.280 --> 48:57.920
Sam? Oh, my God. Are you OK?

48:57.960 --> 49:00.160
You're OK.

49:00.200 --> 49:01.440
Yeah.
Oh.

49:20.280 --> 49:22.280
George?

49:48.960 --> 49:52.200
Hello.
Stewart? Are you OK?

49:52.240 --> 49:55.200
Um, I'm fine.

49:55.240 --> 49:58.400
What...what's...what's going on?

50:00.040 --> 50:03.480
There's been a blackout for 12
hours. We thought you were all dead.

50:04.360 --> 50:08.040
"Erm, the police are on their way.
Don't move. OK?"

50:09.600 --> 50:11.600
OK, love.

50:16.520 --> 50:18.520
What happened?

50:21.120 --> 50:23.400
You...you can't be here.

50:31.560 --> 50:35.400
Right. I want our units to join
the ambulance and the fire teams

50:35.440 --> 50:37.720
at the border of the zone.
You go in slowly,

50:37.760 --> 50:40.360
and you go according to strict
emergency procedures.

50:40.400 --> 50:42.560
Let's move.

50:42.600 --> 50:44.600
You have to stay here?

50:44.640 --> 50:46.520
Yeah, I have to co-ordinate
all my units.

50:46.560 --> 50:49.200
"This is Fire Vehicle
Gamma Alpha on channel three.

50:49.240 --> 50:52.000
We are approaching the Zone Limit."
Move in slowly.

50:53.760 --> 50:55.760
Have you tried your wife?

50:57.320 --> 50:58.800
Nothing yet.

50:58.840 --> 51:01.240
What's your address?

51:44.880 --> 51:46.880
Wait here, please.

52:04.400 --> 52:06.000
Deborah?

52:29.280 --> 52:31.280
Deborah? Deborah!

52:32.040 --> 52:33.200
Deborah.

52:36.960 --> 52:38.960
Are you Deborah?

54:30.320 --> 54:32.320
Daddy!

54:32.360 --> 54:33.880
Oh.

56:25.600 --> 56:27.000
Oh, Cassie, I'm sorry.

56:27.040 --> 56:29.600
I am so, so sorry.

56:29.640 --> 56:30.960
It's OK.

56:31.000 --> 56:33.000
It's OK.

56:35.200 --> 56:36.600
It's OK.

56:37.840 --> 56:39.840
It's OK, Mum.

57:31.600 --> 57:34.120
# In April

57:34.160 --> 57:36.920
# I open my bill

57:36.960 --> 57:39.440
# In May

57:39.480 --> 57:42.000
# I sing night and day

57:42.040 --> 57:44.800
# In June

57:44.840 --> 57:47.520
# I change my tune

57:47.560 --> 57:50.120
# In July

57:50.160 --> 57:52.880
# Far, far I fly

57:52.920 --> 57:55.480
# In August

57:55.520 --> 58:02.200
# Away!

58:06.760 --> 58:10.040
# Cuckoo

58:15.160 --> 58:18.920
# Cuckoo... #

58:21.800 --> 58:23.800
