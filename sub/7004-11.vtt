00:02.401 --> 00:05.169
Thank you. And welcome back
to our segment on stain removal.

00:05.170 --> 00:08.172
When talking about stains,
most people think of stains
like you get in clothes -

00:08.173 --> 00:09.874
Food stains, grease stains...

00:09.875 --> 00:13.244
And the kind tim is most
familiar with, bloodstains.

00:13.245 --> 00:16.114
Oh. Speaking of stains,
what is that?

00:16.114 --> 00:18.750
Ting!

00:18.751 --> 00:21.252
Can't believe I fell for that.
It's the oldest trick
in the book.

00:21.253 --> 00:24.789
No, no, no, al.
That is the oldest trick
in the book.

00:24.790 --> 00:26.925
Would you just get back
with stains?
All right.

00:26.926 --> 00:29.494
We're not talking about stains
around the house
that your wife can get out

00:29.495 --> 00:31.562
With cotton balls
and club soda.

00:31.563 --> 00:35.366
We're talking about
man-sized stains. <i>(grunts)</i>
that's right.

00:35.367 --> 00:38.169
Soot and grime that gets on
the outside of buildings.

00:38.170 --> 00:42.340
For stains like these,
you need better remedies -
steam-cleaners, sandblasters,

00:42.341 --> 00:44.609
Solvents,
high-pressure washers.

00:44.610 --> 00:46.745
Larry, follow al
and me outside.

00:46.746 --> 00:48.747
That's right.
We're gonna use high pressure

00:48.748 --> 00:51.182
To get the soot and grime off
the outside our building.

00:51.183 --> 00:54.352
That's right.
We're gonna be removing
some graffiti. Hi, chrissy.

00:54.353 --> 00:57.155
Actually, tim, there's no
graffiti on our building.

00:57.156 --> 00:59.190
There is now.

00:59.191 --> 01:01.526
Now, remember, al, I did this
to show the audience

01:01.527 --> 01:03.795
How to remove graffiti, ok?

01:03.796 --> 01:06.364
Do you think the pressure washer
will take it off?

01:06.365 --> 01:09.400
I sure hope so,
for al's sake.

01:14.339 --> 01:17.108
"al is a gal"?

01:17.109 --> 01:19.110
Why are you
calling me a gal?

01:19.111 --> 01:20.578
'cause it rhymes with al.

01:20.579 --> 01:24.515
And I couldn't remember
if weenie ended
with "y" or "ie."

01:24.516 --> 01:26.350
All right, enough is enough.

01:26.351 --> 01:29.921
I am tired of being
embarrassed all the time.

01:29.922 --> 01:31.990
Look at your fly.

01:31.991 --> 01:34.092
Got you again!

01:34.093 --> 01:36.360
Anyway, we're gonna remove
this bad rumor

01:36.361 --> 01:39.164
With binford's 6100
series power washer.

01:39.165 --> 01:41.866
Now, normally these things
have about 11 horse,

01:41.867 --> 01:44.335
But I've added
a few extra ponies.

01:44.336 --> 01:46.738
<i>(al)</i> how many more?

01:46.739 --> 01:49.574
Oh, about 100.
Heidi, start her up.

01:49.575 --> 01:50.641
Stand back.

02:04.389 --> 02:06.390
Just like butter.

02:13.232 --> 02:16.167
Well, that worked
just great.

02:16.168 --> 02:18.636
Now "al's a gal"
is in there permanently,

02:18.637 --> 02:20.638
And what are
you gonna do about that?

02:20.639 --> 02:23.441
Add "for a good time, call..."

03:14.693 --> 03:17.461
<i>(drumming)</i>

03:17.462 --> 03:20.464

No, guys, guys.
You can't sing
"ba bum ba bum bum."

03:32.111 --> 03:34.279
It's "pa rum pa pum pum."

03:34.280 --> 03:37.315
"ba bum ba bum bum"
just doesn't make any sense.

03:37.316 --> 03:38.950
What's the difference?

03:38.951 --> 03:42.320
Well, if you sing
"ba bam ba bum bum"

03:42.321 --> 03:43.621
Instead of "pa rum pa pum pum,"

03:43.622 --> 03:46.557
Everybody'll think
you're da da da da dumb.

03:48.828 --> 03:51.395
Ok. Now try it again,

04:09.548 --> 04:14.185
Yes!
Oh, guys, you have
no sense of commitment.

04:14.186 --> 04:17.221
All right, get all your hats

04:17.223 --> 04:20.225
I'm gonna walk 'em out.
<i>(jill)</i> thanks!

04:21.692 --> 04:23.627
You know, these guys
have just got to learn

04:23.628 --> 04:25.730
That christmas
is not just about fun.

04:25.731 --> 04:30.034
You taught me.
I'm sure you can teach them.

04:30.035 --> 04:33.571
What is this?
You guys are supposed
to stay here

04:33.572 --> 04:35.673
And help paint
the sets for mark's pageant.

04:35.674 --> 04:39.043
I gotta paint a whole village.
We'd love to stay
and help you.

04:39.044 --> 04:43.547
But unfortunately we've got
that gosh darn hockey game
this afternoon.

04:43.548 --> 04:47.718
Well, what time is
this "gosh darn" hockey game
gonna be over?

04:47.719 --> 04:52.090
Well, what time are you
gonna be done painting?

04:52.091 --> 04:54.525
Well, if that's your attitude,

04:54.526 --> 04:56.861
I just don't know
if I want you to help me
after all.

04:56.862 --> 04:59.898
All right!

04:59.899 --> 05:02.066
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

05:02.067 --> 05:04.835
Tim, it's just you and I
painting these sets.

05:04.836 --> 05:06.938
Would you start
by moving the hot rod
out of the garage?

05:06.939 --> 05:10.808
I can't go now.
I'm five minutes late already
at eddie's body shop.

05:10.809 --> 05:14.678
Eddie's auto shop?
Yeah.
He's having that party.

05:14.679 --> 05:18.049
The editor from <i>hot rod</i>
<i>magazine's</i> gonna be there.
I told you about this.

05:18.050 --> 05:20.251
I have this fourth grade
christmas pageant to produce.

05:20.252 --> 05:22.387
I've only got one week left.

05:22.388 --> 05:25.223
I won't be late.
I'll be home right after, ok?

Hi, dad.

It's just you and me now
doing all this work.

05:34.833 --> 05:38.036
Will you bring the paint
out to the garage while
I move the hot rod out?

05:38.037 --> 05:40.704
I can't. I'm going
over to billy's.

05:40.705 --> 05:44.775
Right. And leave me alone
here to do all the work
on your pageant.

05:44.776 --> 05:47.711
Yep.

05:47.712 --> 05:51.382
Oh, well, now I think about it,
I'd much rather stay here
with you.

05:55.754 --> 05:58.923
I'll never forget
my fourth grade christmas play.

05:58.924 --> 06:01.826
I memorized all my lines
months in advance.

06:01.827 --> 06:05.430
I was so excited.
I got to be mary.

06:05.431 --> 06:07.966
Bet you were great.
Oh, I was, I was.

06:07.967 --> 06:10.868
I had the audience eating out
of the palm of my hand

06:10.869 --> 06:14.772
Until I threw up all over
the three wise men.

06:17.776 --> 06:21.145
Mom, great game.
Yeah. We won, two to one.

06:21.146 --> 06:23.781
Well, that's great,
but, guys, when it's snowing,

06:23.782 --> 06:25.116
You're supposed to come
through the garage,

06:25.117 --> 06:28.319
Not track it all over the house.
When did it start snowing?

06:28.320 --> 06:31.722
A few hours ago.
Mom, didn't you
notice the blizzard?

06:31.723 --> 06:35.193
No. I was inside painting
all day

06:35.194 --> 06:37.661
While the rest of my family
was out having fun.

06:37.662 --> 06:38.929
Where's the hot rod?

06:38.930 --> 06:41.132
The hot rod.

06:41.133 --> 06:46.237
Yeah. You know, the thing
dad kisses every night
before he goes to bed.

06:51.377 --> 06:55.179
Oh, my god!
I left it outside.

06:55.180 --> 06:57.648
Well, you covered it,
right?

06:57.649 --> 06:59.283
Wrong.

07:07.426 --> 07:09.427
It's covered now.

07:21.740 --> 07:26.144
How could I have done
something so stupid?

07:26.145 --> 07:29.213
They say when two people
have been married
for a long time,

07:29.214 --> 07:31.949
They start acting
like each other.

07:36.755 --> 07:39.690
You're not helping, brad.

07:39.691 --> 07:42.326
Mom, we better clean this up
before dad gets home.

07:42.327 --> 07:45.163
Look, it's just snow.
Snow is water, water is wet.

07:45.164 --> 07:47.165
Anything wet can be dried.

07:47.166 --> 07:51.169
Why don't you just throw it in
the dryer and set it on auto?

07:53.172 --> 07:55.173
Randy, will you turn up
the heat?

07:55.174 --> 07:57.942
Brad, start scooping.
Just dump the snow
outside that door.

07:57.943 --> 08:02.046
Mark, you keep watch.
Your father could be home
any minute.

08:02.047 --> 08:05.015
Dad's coming.
That's not funny.

08:05.016 --> 08:07.685
No, he's really coming.
Oh, my god!

08:07.686 --> 08:10.488
Ok, guys, guys,
you get to work.

08:10.489 --> 08:12.790
I'm gonna try to stall him.
Ok.

08:14.526 --> 08:16.194
Whoo!

08:16.195 --> 08:19.997
Boy, that blizzard
dumped some snow out there, huh?

08:19.998 --> 08:22.800
Hi, honey.
You're home early.

08:22.801 --> 08:24.402
I had one of
the best days of my life.

08:24.403 --> 08:27.438
I had a long talk
with the editor
from <i>hot rod magazine.</i>

08:27.439 --> 08:31.709
Congratulations.
Oh, honey, that's wonderful.

08:31.710 --> 08:34.645
I didn't tell you
what we talked about.
Right! You didn't tell me!

08:34.645 --> 08:36.313
You should sit down
and tell me.
What?

08:36.315 --> 08:39.517
Every single word,
even if it takes all night.

08:39.518 --> 08:41.184
You want some coffee?
Sure, why not?

08:41.186 --> 08:44.688
They're thinking of doing
an article on my hot rod.

08:44.689 --> 08:46.724
Your hot rod.

08:46.725 --> 08:48.692
He's coming by
early in the morning
to check it out.

08:48.693 --> 08:51.795
Oh, god!

08:53.465 --> 08:55.333
It's great news.

08:55.334 --> 08:58.636
I told him it was a cherry
hot rod. It's never even been
out in the rain.

08:58.637 --> 09:01.205
I probably spend more time
with that than I do with...

09:01.206 --> 09:03.841
Never mind.

09:03.842 --> 09:05.943
I gotta go out there
and tweak some stuff out.

09:05.944 --> 09:08.679
No, wait!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

09:08.680 --> 09:11.815
Um... Tell me some more
about this man.
What man?

09:11.816 --> 09:15.353
This editor. How old is he?
Where was he born?
I don't know, new jersey.

09:15.354 --> 09:18.456
What books and movies
does he like?
Who would know?

09:18.457 --> 09:20.958
What kinds of books
and movies do you like?
What difference does it make?

09:20.959 --> 09:23.461
Well, we have not talked
about books and movies
for a long time.

09:23.462 --> 09:25.229
I feel like
we're drifting apart.

09:25.230 --> 09:30.168
Why don't you sit down here
and we'll just talk
like we used to, you know.

09:30.169 --> 09:33.037
You know what
my favorite book is?
No, I don't.

09:33.038 --> 09:35.306
The encyclopedia.

09:37.976 --> 09:41.312
Have you been hitting the eggnog
a little early this year?

09:41.313 --> 09:45.216
No, no, honey. Oh, tim! Tim!
I have a great idea.

09:45.217 --> 09:48.352
Let's go to the movies,
right now.
I can't go to the movies.

09:48.353 --> 09:50.087
Tim, don't say that you can't.

09:50.088 --> 09:54.425
If you believe you can,
you can make it happen.

09:54.426 --> 09:56.594
I believe you've lost
your mind, honey.

10:02.234 --> 10:04.802
My hot rod!

10:04.803 --> 10:07.371
You always said
you wanted a snowmobile.

10:09.908 --> 10:12.743
Who did this to my car?
Mom, do you wanna
take that one?

10:12.744 --> 10:15.479
And by the way,
good luck.

10:15.480 --> 10:18.916
You did this?
Honey. Honey, it was
just an accident.

10:18.917 --> 10:21.885
You know, it wasn't snowing
when I moved it outside.

10:21.886 --> 10:25.055
You did this?
Look at all the snow in here.

10:25.056 --> 10:27.758
The interior's wrecked.
The carpet's all wet.

10:27.759 --> 10:30.160
Look, my gauges are
all fogged up.

10:30.161 --> 10:33.397
Well, couldn't you just take
them out and dry them off

10:33.398 --> 10:34.898
And then put 'em
back together?

10:34.899 --> 10:38.236
You love to take things apart
and put 'em back together.

10:38.237 --> 10:40.137
How'd this happen?

10:40.138 --> 10:42.640
Honey, I've been under
a lot of pressure lately.

10:42.641 --> 10:45.909
I've had the christmas pageant
and christmas shopping
and school

10:45.910 --> 10:47.811
And my parents coming
next week.

10:47.812 --> 10:51.249
There's no excuse for this.
Why don't you just admit
you screwed up?

10:51.250 --> 10:53.117
Well!

10:53.118 --> 10:56.354
I think that you could be
a little bit more understanding.

10:56.355 --> 10:58.723
I mean, it's not like
this was my fault.

11:02.361 --> 11:04.795
Whose fault was this?
Yours.

11:07.633 --> 11:10.601
Hello!

11:12.471 --> 11:16.641
Hey, if you had moved
the hot rod out of the garage
as I asked you to,

11:16.642 --> 11:19.510
Then you would've remembered
to put the cover on.

11:19.511 --> 11:22.012
This is unbelievable.

11:22.013 --> 11:24.348
Did I blame you when I dropped
the beam on your car?

11:24.349 --> 11:27.318
Yes, you did.
And remember how
lame that was?

11:27.319 --> 11:30.621
Yes, I do.
I've worked on this car
for three years.

11:30.622 --> 11:34.057
And you send it outside
like a stray cat. This is
like a member of the family.

11:34.058 --> 11:36.927
You just wait a minute.
Every single thing
that I have ever owned,

11:36.928 --> 11:38.929
You have managed
to puncture, singe,

11:38.930 --> 11:41.198
Pulverize, crack,
crush, melt or explode,

11:41.199 --> 11:43.367
And every single time,
I have managed to come up

11:43.368 --> 11:45.503
With the compassion
to forgive you.

11:45.504 --> 11:47.638
This one time that something
like this happens,

11:47.639 --> 11:50.874
Do you have the same compassion
to forgive me? No!

11:50.875 --> 11:54.745
Thank you so much!
Honey, I...

12:00.251 --> 12:04.355
Wait a minute.
You are really good.

12:06.958 --> 12:10.060
You screw up
and I'm getting yelled at.

12:10.061 --> 12:13.964
You are really, really good.

12:19.371 --> 12:21.439
When you've got that gauge
dried out,

12:21.440 --> 12:24.208
You can use these towels
to sop up the carpet.

12:24.209 --> 12:27.611
You know what, tim?
I haven't heard the word
"please" all night.

12:27.612 --> 12:31.415
You're right. Please shut up
and get back to work.

12:33.819 --> 12:37.154
I'm starving.
I thought you said
there'd be sandwiches.

12:37.155 --> 12:39.990
What do I look like?
A deli?

12:39.991 --> 12:43.293
All I'm saying is that
if you were over at my house
sopping up a car,

12:43.294 --> 12:46.564
I would serve you
a little something.
I'm sorry, al.

12:46.565 --> 12:48.566
The guy's coming tomorrow
and it's important to me.

12:48.567 --> 12:50.901
I'm kinda worried about it,
all right?

12:53.472 --> 12:56.374
Hey, guys.
You've been working for hours.

12:56.375 --> 12:58.809
Wouldn't you like me
to make you sandwiches?

12:58.810 --> 13:02.079
We're all right, jill.
Well... Well, actually...

13:02.080 --> 13:05.783
If we eat it'll just
take longer, all right?

13:05.784 --> 13:07.785
Tim...

13:07.786 --> 13:10.921
I've been thinking
and maybe you're right.

13:10.922 --> 13:13.290
Maybe I have a problem
admitting when I'm wrong.

13:13.291 --> 13:16.594
You know, I think that
it has to do with
my relationship with my mother.

13:16.595 --> 13:19.963
No, no, no. Please, not this
"my mother made me screw up"
again.

13:19.964 --> 13:22.633
You know, I have a lot of
issues with my mother.

13:22.634 --> 13:24.301
Here we go.

13:24.302 --> 13:29.139
You see, to my mother
an apology was like
an admission of guilt,

13:29.140 --> 13:31.475
Which gave her the right to
give me a nine-hour lecture

13:31.476 --> 13:33.143
On what a bad person I was.

13:33.144 --> 13:36.680
That's fascinating, jill, it
really is, but I'm not your mom.

13:36.681 --> 13:40.083
I thought you'd pick up on
that since I stopped wearing
my hair in a beehive.

13:41.820 --> 13:45.989
Tim, the mother-child
relationship has all
these complexities

13:45.990 --> 13:48.559
That affect all aspects
of your life.

13:48.560 --> 13:52.162
Boy, is that true.
No matter how hard
you fight against it,

13:52.163 --> 13:54.565
You always are
your mother's child.

13:54.566 --> 13:56.567
Hey, I got a great idea.

13:56.568 --> 14:00.370
Let's all get together
tomorrow night and watch
<i>terms of endearment.</i>

14:03.909 --> 14:06.243
<i>(jill)</i> wilson!

14:06.244 --> 14:08.846
Wilson.

14:08.847 --> 14:12.182
Hi-de-ho, neighborette.

14:12.183 --> 14:14.051
<i>(jill)</i> is that the heater
that tim wanted?

14:14.052 --> 14:16.754
Yes, indeedy. So how's
the hot rod coming along?

14:16.755 --> 14:18.923
Oh, it's still really wet.

14:18.924 --> 14:23.761
I don't know if it's gonna dry
in time. I'm so mad at myself.

14:23.762 --> 14:27.465
Wilson, I've been
thinking about this.

14:27.466 --> 14:30.133
Do you think
that subconsciously

14:30.134 --> 14:33.838
I left the hot rod out
in the snow to get back at tim

14:33.839 --> 14:37.475
For dropping that two-ton beam
on my station wagon?

14:37.476 --> 14:39.977
Well, jill, that's a very
interesting theory,

14:39.978 --> 14:43.581
But I'm sure that your
leaving the car out
was just an accident.

14:43.582 --> 14:46.183
Yeah. But you know
what freud says about that -

14:46.184 --> 14:48.285
"there are no accidents."

14:48.286 --> 14:51.489
Well, obviously freud
never saw <i>tool time.</i>

14:54.826 --> 14:59.329
Well, maybe I was
personifying the hot rod

14:59.330 --> 15:01.331
As a rival for tim's love,

15:01.332 --> 15:03.934
Then transferring
my feelings of jealousy to it.
Well, jill--

15:03.935 --> 15:06.504
Or it could just be about
the balance of power
in the relationship.

15:06.505 --> 15:09.607
You know, I have always had
a problem subjugating my ego

15:09.608 --> 15:11.609
To the strong-willed male -
I.E. My dad.

15:11.610 --> 15:17.581
It just taps right into
my preadolescent, deep-seated
feelings of rejection.

15:17.582 --> 15:21.151
Jill, the psychological
knowledge you're acquiring
at college

15:21.152 --> 15:23.587
Can give you some
very powerful insights.

15:23.588 --> 15:25.222
You're telling me.

15:25.223 --> 15:27.625
On the other hand,
a little knowledge
and a vivid imagination

15:27.626 --> 15:30.561
Can really make
a person cuckoo.

15:32.564 --> 15:35.966
So you think I'm just
reading too much into this?
Yes, I do.

15:35.967 --> 15:39.136
So basically
I just screwed up.

15:39.137 --> 15:41.304
Yes, you did.

15:41.305 --> 15:43.306
Yeah. You're probably right.

15:43.307 --> 15:47.978
Tim just accused me
of not being able
to admit it when I'm wrong.

15:47.979 --> 15:51.849
I do have a tendency to,
you know, just pass blame
on to other people.

15:51.850 --> 15:56.086
Of course, tim was the one
who didn't move the hot rod
out of the garage,

15:56.087 --> 15:58.556
Not to mention the fact
that he went
to a hot-rod party.

15:58.557 --> 16:02.192
Brad and randy went off
to some hockey game and...
Jill. Jill.

16:02.193 --> 16:05.095
<i>(grunts)</i> I'm doing it again.
Right.

16:07.432 --> 16:10.000
Thanks, wilson.
<i>(chuckles)</i>

16:11.169 --> 16:13.437
<i>(tim)</i> al, what are you doing?

16:15.206 --> 16:17.240
Al.
Uh-huh.

16:17.241 --> 16:19.109
What are you doing?

16:19.110 --> 16:22.279
Getting a drink of water.

16:22.280 --> 16:26.750
<i>(tim)</i> what's taking you
so long?
Oh, I'm really thirsty.

16:30.855 --> 16:33.423
Al?
Mm-hmm?

16:33.424 --> 16:36.259
What are you doing, al?
Nothing.

16:43.468 --> 16:45.135
Nothing.
You're eating.

16:45.136 --> 16:47.571
No.
Yes.

16:48.974 --> 16:52.476
It's 1:30 in the morning.
I had an early lunch

16:52.477 --> 16:56.647
And I get a little testy when
I haven't eaten in 14 hours.

16:56.648 --> 16:58.649
I'm taking a break.

16:58.650 --> 17:01.418
I got an idea.
Let me have that.

17:03.622 --> 17:06.056
We'll split it

17:06.057 --> 17:08.290
And we'll both take five.

17:09.661 --> 17:11.028
Deal.

17:14.031 --> 17:15.766
Hey.

17:15.767 --> 17:18.401
It's good.
What do you call this?

17:18.402 --> 17:20.436
Ham and cheese.

17:22.073 --> 17:26.209
The trick is, though,
to add a little dill
to your mustard.

17:26.210 --> 17:30.014
Al, you live life
on the edge.

17:34.485 --> 17:38.689
You know, tim,
I don't want you to get
the wrong impression

17:38.690 --> 17:41.525
About my relationship
with my mother.

17:45.163 --> 17:49.099
Yes, we've had
some difficult moments,

17:49.100 --> 17:52.569
And, yes,
she can be overbearing -

17:52.570 --> 17:55.105
Suffocating, really -

17:57.575 --> 18:00.310
But she means well.

18:02.047 --> 18:05.849
However, she does have
a pretty tart tongue.

18:10.755 --> 18:13.057
<i>(snores)</i>

18:45.724 --> 18:48.258
Oh. Oh.

18:48.259 --> 18:52.262
Ow! What time is it?
What day is it?

18:52.263 --> 18:55.699
What am I doing sleeping
with al? Get up!

18:55.700 --> 18:58.102
Is it five minutes already?

18:58.103 --> 19:00.771
It's been five hours.

19:02.607 --> 19:05.943
The guy's gonna be here
in 15 minutes. I am dead.

19:05.944 --> 19:08.112
I gotta go.
No, stick around.

19:08.113 --> 19:10.614
No. I mean I gotta go.

19:13.517 --> 19:17.354
We've got a bathroom
in the house, al.

19:25.396 --> 19:27.430
Whoa!

19:27.431 --> 19:29.800
Hi, honey.

19:31.702 --> 19:35.605
The car looks dry.
It's dry as a bone.

19:35.606 --> 19:37.207
How'd you do this?

19:37.208 --> 19:39.309
I'm packing heat.

19:42.781 --> 19:46.449
I even conditioned
the leather.

19:46.450 --> 19:47.517
Oh!

19:47.518 --> 19:49.586
I came down in the middle
of the night

19:49.587 --> 19:51.855
And saw you two sleeping
on the couch

19:51.856 --> 19:55.926
With little pieces of dill
stuck to your lips.

19:55.927 --> 19:57.995
It was very cute.

19:57.996 --> 19:59.797
I didn't have the heart
to wake you,

19:59.798 --> 20:03.533
So I just decided that I
would finish it all myself.

20:03.534 --> 20:05.335
I can't believe you did this.

20:05.336 --> 20:08.172
Well, after all,

20:08.173 --> 20:11.241
It was my fault.

20:13.477 --> 20:17.114
I don't know, I think I must
have some dill caught in my ear.
Could you say that a bit louder?

20:17.115 --> 20:20.150
Don't push your luck.

20:20.151 --> 20:22.686
Get in. See if it
meets your approval.

20:24.289 --> 20:28.325
Jill, this is the greatest gift
you've ever given me.

20:28.326 --> 20:30.493
I gave you three children.

20:30.494 --> 20:33.396
Yeah, but none of them
came out this clean.

20:35.967 --> 20:39.837
The interior looks really good.
You did a really nice job
on all the little details here.

20:39.838 --> 20:43.573
Did you wax this thing?
I waxed it.

20:43.574 --> 20:48.411
You know, deep down
you must be a car babe.

20:48.412 --> 20:52.549
Very, very deep down.

20:52.550 --> 20:54.517
I love you.

21:09.901 --> 21:12.435
I've still got it.

21:16.474 --> 21:20.310
♪ come, they told me

21:20.311 --> 21:22.645
♪ pa rum pa pum pum

21:22.646 --> 21:24.181
Great news, honey.
Oh, I'm sorry.

21:24.182 --> 21:27.017
No, it's ok.
Really. Really.

21:27.018 --> 21:29.552
Boys, do you wanna
take a break?
Ok.

21:29.553 --> 21:34.291
Yeah.
I need aspirin
and I need it now.

21:34.292 --> 21:37.895
They decided to put a picture
of the hot rod in the magazine.

21:37.896 --> 21:41.098
They did?
Oh, good. I'm so glad.

21:41.099 --> 21:45.903
And they're gonna get
a woman in a string bikini
to sit on the hood.

21:45.904 --> 21:50.941
Tim, I have never been
more proud of you
than I am at this moment.

21:50.942 --> 21:52.575
I suggested you be
that woman.

21:58.716 --> 22:01.118
Well, I appreciate
the thought, tim,

22:01.119 --> 22:04.388
But there's not enough string
in the whole wide world.

22:08.126 --> 22:11.628
Tim, the complexities of
the mother-child relationship

22:11.629 --> 22:13.363
Affect all aspects
of your life.

22:13.364 --> 22:15.899
Oh, boy, ain't that the truth?

22:15.900 --> 22:19.036
You know, no... How...
How matter how hard
you try to fight against it,

22:19.037 --> 22:20.904
You're always
your mother's child.

22:20.905 --> 22:23.473
Hey, I got a fun idea.

22:25.676 --> 22:27.710
<i>(jabbers)</i>
