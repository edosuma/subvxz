We need to talk about Ainsley.

00:48.073 --> 00:52.217
Your father and I have
discussed it, and we think

00:52.410 --> 00:55.387
it's time to tell her the truth
about Nicholas Endicott.

00:55.556 --> 00:56.889
Specifically,
that she killed him.

00:57.082 --> 00:59.475
(guttural grunting)

01:01.053 --> 01:02.786
That's a bad idea.

01:02.888 --> 01:04.730
She's suffering from PTSD.

01:04.923 --> 01:07.291
Learning the full story
will only make it worse.

01:07.351 --> 01:09.050
Not if we tell her as a family.

01:09.153 --> 01:11.386
That way,
<i> we</i> control the narrative.

01:11.447 --> 01:14.147
Of course. It's about control.

Of course I'm worried.

Discovering that you've been
lied to about something

01:27.946 --> 01:29.588

I wish I didn't know.

Well, I wish you had just
gone to the police

01:49.276 --> 01:50.943

Yes. Historically,

you love going to the cops

01:56.283 --> 01:57.691

01:57.785 --> 02:00.177
Okay, okay, so you needed
to lie a little.

02:00.237 --> 02:03.271
But why not say self-defense?

02:03.290 --> 02:04.606
Our lawyers could have
run with that.

02:04.667 --> 02:06.032
Oh, now, now, Jessie,
nobody likes

02:06.127 --> 02:08.085

02:10.747 --> 02:11.630
Maybe you're right.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.524
Maybe I handled this
all wrong from the start.

02:14.626 --> 02:17.636
Or... counterpoint,
maybe you handled it wrong

02:17.829 --> 02:19.546
when you dropped a dime
on dear old Dad.

-Enough, Martin.

Thank you for protecting
your sister.

You were put in

04:28.477 --> 04:30.435
The killer didn't bring
their own weapon,

this was impulsive.

-Or maybe you realized

encoding, processing
information.

29:32.772 --> 29:34.938

so concretely.

29:41.638 --> 29:43.930

it's definitely not,

29:43.991 --> 29:45.616

is in these pages.

34:01.540 --> 34:03.765

34:03.825 --> 34:06.117
It was a group effort.

34:06.253 --> 34:08.194
-Couldn't have done it
without you.
-Aw.

34:08.255 --> 34:10.029
You sure you're feeling better?

34:10.049 --> 34:12.607
So much better. Those strange
headaches have stopped.

34:12.626 --> 34:14.718
What a relief.

34:14.911 --> 34:16.386
I don't know who
I am prouder of,

34:16.555 --> 34:19.205
my daughter following
in her father's footsteps,

34:19.266 --> 34:22.225
or my son forging
his own way in the world.

34:43.290 --> 34:46.324
to join in our celebrations;
we'd love to see her.

34:46.476 --> 34:48.476
I will. She's just

Oh, she has been such a good

34:52.615 --> 34:54.332

You got a great job,

35:42.891 --> 35:46.050
a happy relationship,
and there's even cocoa.

35:46.145 --> 35:49.813

36:05.664 --> 36:06.997
<i> But it's not.</i>

36:07.190 --> 36:11.376
It's what life would be

36:12.838 --> 36:14.412
(banging, rattling)

36:14.506 --> 36:17.657

36:21.871 --> 36:24.406
Even if I don't open the box,

36:24.424 --> 36:26.016
the woman in there
is still in pain.

36:26.167 --> 36:28.593
Now, Herr Schrodinger might
disagree with you on that.

No matter how painful.

36:44.286 --> 36:46.686
Oh, that's nice. Yeah.

36:46.788 --> 36:50.281
Though, for someone so hellbent
on uncovering secrets,

36:50.375 --> 36:54.936
you sure do have
a lot of your own.

36:54.996 --> 36:56.804
You're right.

36:56.831 --> 36:59.049
I need to work on that.

37:00.719 --> 37:01.867
Dani won't be there.

37:01.929 --> 37:05.388
Not like she is here.

37:10.845 --> 37:14.639

37:14.733 --> 37:17.642
Stay for her.

37:17.794 --> 37:21.404
A partner you can actually
be honest with?

37:21.556 --> 37:24.532
You'll never have that
if you open that box.

37:27.103 --> 37:28.987
It's your fault.

37:29.081 --> 37:31.656
