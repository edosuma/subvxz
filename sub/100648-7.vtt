00:04.091 --> 00:06.223
- Previously
on "Good Girls"...

00:06.267 --> 00:07.137
- Let me tell you something
about my husband.

00:07.181 --> 00:09.400
Stanley Lamont Hill is a cop,

00:09.444 --> 00:11.881
whether you give him a badge
or not.

00:11.924 --> 00:15.319
He couldn't commit a crime
if his life depended on it.

00:15.363 --> 00:16.668
Well, what'd they say?

00:16.712 --> 00:18.540
- They'd be honored
to have me back on the force.

00:18.583 --> 00:21.369
Then I came home,
tried on my uniform.

00:21.412 --> 00:22.979
It made me feel like a fraud.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.546
- Will you have dinner
with me?

00:24.589 --> 00:26.200
- Talk strategy, or--

00:26.243 --> 00:28.158
- Whatever you need
to tell your wife.

00:28.202 --> 00:29.725
- I really want to,

00:29.768 --> 00:31.248
but I can't.

00:31.292 --> 00:32.423
Are you making money?

00:32.467 --> 00:35.557
- It's different this time.

00:36.384 --> 00:37.907
- Looks a little light.

00:37.950 --> 00:39.169
- I couldn't make as much.

00:39.213 --> 00:41.041
The price of ink went up.

00:41.084 --> 00:43.782
- Gonna need to see
that invoice.

00:43.826 --> 00:45.132
- Thought you might.

00:45.175 --> 00:47.177
Remember that project
you did for us a while back?

00:47.221 --> 00:49.266
- Gambling addicts, right?

00:49.310 --> 00:50.528
- She's not gonna do it

00:50.572 --> 00:51.964
unless we take something
she cares about.

00:52.008 --> 00:53.618
- Meet Dorito Boland.

00:53.662 --> 00:54.837
- What's up, ladies?

00:54.880 --> 00:57.144
- You cannot finish that plate.

00:57.187 --> 00:59.102
- He said he'd let me go--
- He won't.

00:59.146 --> 01:02.062
Wait. You need us.
You need all of us.

01:02.105 --> 01:04.934
- Not all of you.

01:06.109 --> 01:07.284
- Have you heard from Lucy?

01:07.328 --> 01:08.677
- I'm sure she's fine.

01:08.720 --> 01:09.721
- Lucy Lulu?

01:09.765 --> 01:11.114
- She's not here.

01:11.158 --> 01:12.898
- She just texted me
this morning.

01:12.942 --> 01:15.292
- And then I drove her
right to the airport.

01:15.336 --> 01:16.598
- Where'd you get your bird?

01:16.641 --> 01:18.121
- My wife rescued her.

01:28.914 --> 01:30.916
- what is this?

01:30.960 --> 01:33.397
- Ours.

01:33.441 --> 01:34.572
- You stole from a man who

01:34.616 --> 01:36.922
blew a little girl's
brains out for fun?

01:36.966 --> 01:39.186
- 10% off the top.
- What if he finds out?

01:39.229 --> 01:40.404
- He won't.

01:40.448 --> 01:42.928
- What if he does?
- He still needs us.

01:42.972 --> 01:44.800
- Until he doesn't.

01:44.843 --> 01:46.889
And then we all
end up in that van.

01:46.932 --> 01:49.109
- We have to pay our bills.

01:49.152 --> 01:50.980
We print day and night,
and for what?

01:51.023 --> 01:53.330
- To stay alive.

01:53.374 --> 01:55.680
- That's not a life.

01:57.160 --> 01:58.944
What did you say?

01:58.988 --> 02:02.034
- Materials went up.

02:02.078 --> 02:03.427
- Tell him they went back down.

02:03.471 --> 02:06.126
- It's not the NASDAQ.

02:06.169 --> 02:07.953
- You remember Missy Taylor?

02:07.997 --> 02:09.216
- With the eye patch?

02:09.259 --> 02:10.956
- Our class bowler.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.262
- Full ride to Ohio State.

02:12.306 --> 02:13.959
- For bowling?
- She was real good.

02:14.003 --> 02:16.440
- She gave up her scholarship
to stay home with her friends,

02:16.484 --> 02:19.095
and now she's waxing balls
and deodorizing shoes.

02:19.139 --> 02:21.141
- Bomb.

02:21.184 --> 02:22.664
Free food,
a sick arcade,

02:22.707 --> 02:24.970
and 15 lanes
of unlimited bowling--

02:25.014 --> 02:28.844
- All she could talk about
is how she missed her moment.

02:28.887 --> 02:31.673
This is ours, our moment.
We started this.

02:31.716 --> 02:33.892
He can't just come in
and shoot everything up

02:33.936 --> 02:35.024
and just take it all away.

02:35.067 --> 02:36.373
- He kind of can.

02:36.417 --> 02:38.897
- You know who stole?

02:38.941 --> 02:41.117
He did.
From us.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.815
- Mm-hmm.

02:43.859 --> 02:47.297
- Pay your bills.

02:48.429 --> 02:51.519
- Hey, criminals.
No need to hide that.

02:54.043 --> 02:57.786
Got a private party.

02:57.829 --> 03:00.876
Then I gotta do a shift.
I'll see you tomorrow.

03:02.791 --> 03:04.009
Bye.

03:04.053 --> 03:06.186
- Bye.

03:08.362 --> 03:11.408
- He's under a lot
of pressure at work.

03:11.452 --> 03:15.369
- ♪ Do you realize?

03:18.328 --> 03:22.724
♪ Can't show anyone

03:25.248 --> 03:29.165
♪ Eye for an eye

03:32.168 --> 03:37.042

04:24.002 --> 04:27.267
- Cash tips,
leftover birthday cake,

04:27.310 --> 04:28.833
full control of the jukebox--

04:28.877 --> 04:31.358
- There's a scholarship
for bowling?

04:31.401 --> 04:32.837
- She was real good.

04:32.881 --> 04:35.057
- American dream.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.493
- It's just like
if I'd been born

04:36.537 --> 04:39.061
with some kind of gift
or something,

04:39.104 --> 04:41.846
you know, my life would
be totally different.

04:43.631 --> 04:46.111
- How old are you?
- You cannot ask a lady that.

04:46.155 --> 04:48.200
- You're no lady.

04:48.244 --> 04:49.724
- Thank you.

04:49.767 --> 04:50.768
I'm 33.

04:50.812 --> 04:51.813
- Big one.

04:51.856 --> 04:54.294
- Is it?
- Yeah, Jesus year.

04:54.337 --> 04:55.338
- What's that?

04:55.382 --> 04:57.079
- Died a carpenter,
regrouped,

04:57.122 --> 04:58.820
then turned himself
into the most successful brand

04:58.863 --> 05:00.604
in modern history.

05:00.648 --> 05:02.040
- Okay.
- Jesus juice,

05:02.084 --> 05:04.608
Jesus hair, the sandals--
- I got it.

05:04.652 --> 05:06.436
- Then the expressions.
Come to Jesus.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.656
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.
And don't forget the classic--

05:08.699 --> 05:10.571
- Jesus.
- That's the one.

05:10.614 --> 05:13.356
- Hm. Well, I think I see
where you're going with this,

05:13.400 --> 05:17.317
but believe me,
I am no saint.

05:17.360 --> 05:19.667
- Hm.

05:19.710 --> 05:21.669
All right.

05:24.106 --> 05:26.021
You're a boy's medium, right?

05:26.064 --> 05:27.239
- Seriously?

05:27.283 --> 05:29.329
- That's all I got left.

05:30.678 --> 05:33.071
- Gee, thanks,
but I've already got one.

05:33.115 --> 05:35.813
- You're adrift, okay?
We've got to right your ship

05:35.857 --> 05:37.249
and find a port.

05:37.293 --> 05:38.425
- And children fall for this?

05:38.468 --> 05:40.165
- We'll see.
It's a new thing.

05:40.209 --> 05:45.214
- Hmm.

05:45.257 --> 05:49.392
- Oh, by the way, how's
your sister's retinoblastoma?

05:49.436 --> 05:52.308
- Full remission.
- Are you serious?

05:52.352 --> 05:54.832
That's amazing.
That never happens.

05:54.876 --> 05:57.574
- Yeah, well,
some guy at Whole Foods

05:57.618 --> 06:00.708
gave her an herb, so...

06:00.751 --> 06:02.187
we'll see if it lasts.

06:02.231 --> 06:05.103
And yes, thank you.

06:05.147 --> 06:08.411
I am a boy's medium.

06:08.455 --> 06:11.675
- Oh, dry clean only.
The ink runs.

06:17.028 --> 06:19.422
- It doesn't work.

06:19.466 --> 06:21.598
- Duh.

06:24.035 --> 06:26.037
- That's a chow, baby.

06:29.998 --> 06:32.870
What?
- We play Szechwan style.

06:32.914 --> 06:34.959
- You...

06:35.003 --> 06:36.221
damn it.

06:36.265 --> 06:38.659
How'd you guys
get so good at this anyway?

06:38.702 --> 06:41.313
- Locked in those
freight containers for months.

06:41.357 --> 06:44.534
Need something
to pass the time.

06:50.453 --> 06:52.063
- See, that's not...

06:52.107 --> 06:55.415
oh, y'all got jokes tonight?
That's very funny.

06:55.458 --> 06:56.546
- Suck it, bitches.

06:56.590 --> 06:58.069
- Wow.
- No.

06:58.113 --> 06:59.288
- Yes.
- Really?

06:59.331 --> 07:01.682
- Yeah, sure.
- Pay me.

07:01.725 --> 07:03.553
- Oh, man,
you ladies cleaned me out.

07:03.597 --> 07:04.859
I gotta get back to the floor.

07:04.902 --> 07:06.251
- True that.
- All you.

07:06.295 --> 07:08.123
- Oh, wait.
I gotta pay you for the party.

07:08.166 --> 07:10.473
- Okay.

07:13.084 --> 07:14.912
Szechwan style.

07:16.827 --> 07:18.002
Is all that for one night?

07:18.046 --> 07:20.918
- You're worth it.

07:20.962 --> 07:22.224
- Yeah, but...

07:22.267 --> 07:23.443
okay, who was that dude?

07:23.486 --> 07:25.488
- Oh, he had
a sick house, right?

07:25.532 --> 07:27.272
- Yeah, I mean,
the man had full-grown trees

07:27.316 --> 07:28.883
in his living room.

07:28.926 --> 07:31.755
- You could smell
the cherry blossoms.

07:31.799 --> 07:33.496
- And did his friend
look a little shady to you?

07:33.540 --> 07:36.107
- I think it's his bodyguard.

07:36.151 --> 07:38.545
- How do you know that?
- I saw a gun under his jacket.

07:38.588 --> 07:40.460
- What?
- Yeah.

07:40.503 --> 07:43.506
We tried to say it's not cool,
but he only spoke Russian.

07:43.550 --> 07:44.942
- Krystal,
what do you got me into?

07:44.986 --> 07:46.291
- Does it matter?

07:46.335 --> 07:48.250
- I used to be a cop.

07:48.293 --> 07:50.295
- And I used to teach
preschool.

07:50.339 --> 07:53.255

08:33.774 --> 08:37.821
- Craziest thing happened to me
today after the vet.

08:37.865 --> 08:39.475
- Want to take a shower?

08:39.519 --> 08:41.477
- Do I need to?

08:41.521 --> 08:42.783
- I think you do.

08:42.826 --> 08:44.915
- You know, I switched
to that natural stuff

08:44.959 --> 08:46.047
'cause of all the aluminum--

08:46.090 --> 08:49.050

kind of weird after...

09:07.547 --> 09:09.636
you know.

Who knew, right?

09:31.222 --> 09:32.049
It's okay.

09:32.093 --> 09:33.703
- What happened at the vet?

09:33.747 --> 09:36.010
- This nutjob--
he got in my face

09:36.053 --> 09:37.968
and then followed me
back to my car.

09:38.012 --> 09:39.013
- Why?

09:39.056 --> 09:40.231
- He kept saying
that Dorito was his

09:40.275 --> 09:42.059
'cause she was singing
some French song.

09:42.103 --> 09:44.061
And I was like,
"Dude, she knows lots of songs.

09:44.105 --> 09:45.933
My kids taught her,
'Don't Worry, Be Happy.'"

09:45.976 --> 09:47.587
I was like,
"Back off."

09:47.630 --> 09:50.546
But he get getting in her beak,
and calling her Abdul

09:50.590 --> 09:53.244
or Apu or Abu.

09:55.682 --> 09:58.162
- Au Jus.

09:58.206 --> 10:00.730
- Yeah.
How'd you know that?

10:10.958 --> 10:12.263
- Here.
Order anything you want.

10:12.307 --> 10:14.091
It's on me.

10:14.135 --> 10:16.572
- Not hungry.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.053
- What's in the bag?

10:19.096 --> 10:23.013
- You look like
you could use some coffee.

10:23.057 --> 10:26.103
- They make
a mean Arnold Palmer.

10:29.367 --> 10:31.848
- I'm sure
you have a lot of questions.

10:34.677 --> 10:35.852
- Just one.
- Seriously, Max,

10:35.896 --> 10:39.029
what's in the bag?

10:42.380 --> 10:44.339
- Where is my girl?

10:50.519 --> 10:54.610
- We told her not
to get in the van, but she...

10:54.654 --> 10:56.830
she trusted him.

10:56.873 --> 10:59.833
- Sounds like Lucy.

10:59.876 --> 11:02.400
- If it wasn't for her,

11:02.444 --> 11:04.272
we would all be...

11:04.315 --> 11:06.187
- It's true, Max.

11:06.230 --> 11:09.756
- She's a hero.

11:09.799 --> 11:12.541
- Y'all get a chance
to think about food?

11:12.584 --> 11:13.934
- We did not.

11:13.977 --> 11:15.500
- We're gonna need
another minute.

11:15.544 --> 11:17.633
- Well, the chef's got
a few yummy specials,

11:17.677 --> 11:19.679
help kick
your morning off right.

11:19.722 --> 11:21.681
Got an eggs B
that's to die for.

11:21.724 --> 11:23.117
- All set.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.293
- Uh, here.

11:27.469 --> 11:28.818
I'm gonna do the eggs B.

11:28.862 --> 11:30.820
- Yeah, okay.

11:32.169 --> 11:34.302
- I mean, if it's that good.

11:34.345 --> 11:37.479
- What do we do about this...

11:37.522 --> 11:39.524
guy?

11:42.397 --> 11:44.660
- That's the tricky part.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.707
I mean, we can't exactly
go to the cops.

11:47.750 --> 11:51.754
- Or we'll all
end up in that van.

11:51.798 --> 11:52.929
- And it's back.

11:55.105 --> 11:56.367
- I don't want to go
to the cops.

11:56.411 --> 11:59.806
- Okay.
Good.

11:59.849 --> 12:01.721
- I want to kill him.

12:03.505 --> 12:05.812
- Max, it's not that easy.

12:05.855 --> 12:07.117
- Take it from her.

12:07.161 --> 12:09.337
- If you miss,

12:09.380 --> 12:10.338
which you will--

12:10.381 --> 12:13.080
- Again, she would know.

12:13.123 --> 12:15.517
- We're all back in that van.

12:15.560 --> 12:19.216
- So he just gets to do this
to innocent people?

12:19.260 --> 12:22.742
And we just sit here
and we do nothing?

12:22.785 --> 12:24.744
- Arnold Palmer?

12:24.787 --> 12:26.746
- Over there.

12:37.060 --> 12:39.976
- Thank you.

12:42.457 --> 12:44.241
- I've got a cousin.

12:44.285 --> 12:46.374
He's a former Navy SEAL.

12:46.417 --> 12:47.462
- You mean like a--

12:47.505 --> 12:48.680
- He'll do it.

12:48.724 --> 12:49.551
- How much?

12:49.594 --> 12:51.640
- Going rate is 30.

12:51.683 --> 12:54.164
- Grand?
- He won't miss.

12:54.208 --> 12:58.212
- Do you have
that kind of money?

12:58.255 --> 13:00.867
- I was hoping you did.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.303
- We don't.

13:06.089 --> 13:08.396
- Then I have to do it myself.

13:08.439 --> 13:10.746
- Eggs B, coming in hot.
- Jesus.

13:12.574 --> 13:15.664
- Oh, and just some hot sauce.

13:18.449 --> 13:21.409
- No, you don't.

13:21.452 --> 13:23.672
- I've got nothing else
left to lose.

13:28.677 --> 13:31.506
- Max.

13:31.549 --> 13:34.074
Who's your cousin?

13:46.564 --> 13:51.352
- Hey, you got the bromine
charts for the Spa Master 50?

13:51.395 --> 13:54.398
- I do, yeah.
Come on, man.

13:54.442 --> 13:56.009
- Crazy about Jeff, huh?

13:56.052 --> 13:59.839
- What?
- Called up to the big show.

13:59.882 --> 14:01.536
- He got Vegas?

14:01.579 --> 14:04.191
- Regional Sales Manager.

14:04.234 --> 14:05.279
- Seriously?

14:05.322 --> 14:07.455
- And they are
setting him up fine.

14:07.498 --> 14:09.805
Even paying relocation
for the pugs.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.590
- You ever think
about transferring?

14:12.634 --> 14:15.680
- And give up 11 years
at this party palace?

14:15.724 --> 14:18.596
- My wife and I--we're going
through something right now.

14:18.640 --> 14:21.208
There's this guy--I don't
want to get into details.

14:21.251 --> 14:23.558
Anyways,
this guy is...

14:23.601 --> 14:26.517
he's bad news.

14:26.561 --> 14:31.131
It's bad for my marriage.
It's bad for my family.

14:31.174 --> 14:33.568
I mean, we...

14:33.611 --> 14:35.526
we could really use
a change of scenery

14:35.570 --> 14:38.747
right about now.
You know what I'm saying?

14:38.790 --> 14:40.923
- Well, then you gotta get
your sales up.

14:40.967 --> 14:43.186
- How'd he do it?

14:47.974 --> 14:48.975
- Boned Gayle.

14:49.018 --> 14:50.585
- Oh.

14:50.628 --> 14:52.413
Well, how'd you do it?

14:52.456 --> 14:53.936
- Oh, I don't.

14:53.980 --> 14:57.287
I'm buried in credit card debt
and live with my aunt.

14:57.331 --> 14:59.507
- There's gotta be
a middle ground.

14:59.550 --> 15:02.379
- You find it,
let me know.

15:02.423 --> 15:04.773
- Ah!

15:04.816 --> 15:05.600
Found it.

15:05.643 --> 15:06.775
- Oh, great.
Thanks.

15:06.818 --> 15:07.863
- Yeah.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.865
Hey.

15:11.606 --> 15:14.217
Who gets Jeff's leads?

15:14.261 --> 15:15.784
- They just
go back to corporate.

15:15.827 --> 15:17.655
- Not if we get to them first.

15:17.699 --> 15:19.266
- Well, we can't do that.

15:19.309 --> 15:21.050
- Would you rather bone Gayle?

15:23.400 --> 15:24.924
- I'm gay.

15:24.967 --> 15:26.708
- Exactly.

15:28.275 --> 15:29.711
- Oh, you want to talk dumb?

15:29.754 --> 15:31.887
What's dumb is stealing
from a known murderer.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.367
- Shh!

15:33.410 --> 15:36.239
- He's not even here yet.
- Man pops up like a genie.

15:36.283 --> 15:38.502
- It would be so easy.

15:38.546 --> 15:41.853
- How many times can
three people who look like us

15:41.897 --> 15:44.117
commit a robbery
without getting caught?

15:44.160 --> 15:46.162
- Law of averages.

15:46.206 --> 15:47.163
- I'm not up on that law.

15:47.207 --> 15:48.686
- You're not up on any laws.

15:48.730 --> 15:52.168
- There's at least 30 grand
in the safe.

15:52.212 --> 15:53.691
- Oh, my God.

15:53.735 --> 15:54.997
Do you not remember
the last time

15:55.041 --> 15:57.304
you thought there was
"30 grand" in a safe?

15:57.347 --> 15:59.045
- My way's easier, all right?

15:59.088 --> 16:02.918
We skim from a few more runs,
and we'll have it.

16:02.962 --> 16:03.963
- And then what?

16:04.006 --> 16:05.051
We issue a fatwa,

16:05.094 --> 16:08.576
and go home
and make our kids dinner?

16:08.619 --> 16:10.752
- Would it be the worst idea?

16:13.450 --> 16:16.062
- It would not.

16:26.028 --> 16:27.334
- How's it feel?

16:27.377 --> 16:29.510
- Still light.

16:33.427 --> 16:34.776
- Some fancy ink.

16:36.821 --> 16:39.650
- Pigments from India.

16:39.694 --> 16:42.914
- Why I get the feeling this
ink guy's robbing me blind?

16:42.958 --> 16:44.699
- I can't control
the world market.

16:47.745 --> 16:50.139
- Well, bring him by.

16:51.445 --> 16:53.055
- Why?

16:53.099 --> 16:54.665
- I'd like to meet him.

16:54.709 --> 16:56.058
You know, see if we could
work something out.

16:56.102 --> 16:57.712
- He's in Oklahoma.

16:57.755 --> 17:01.194
- Thought you said Kansas City.

17:01.237 --> 17:04.110
- Isn't that in Oklahoma?

17:04.153 --> 17:06.025
- Missouri.

17:08.505 --> 17:11.465
- I'll see what I can do.

17:11.508 --> 17:13.206
- Cool.

17:14.511 --> 17:15.730
- What about the next run?

17:15.773 --> 17:17.253
- Yeah, nah,
that's not gonna happen

17:17.297 --> 17:18.646
till I get my costs down.

17:18.689 --> 17:19.951
- You're still making a profit.

17:19.995 --> 17:21.997
It's still good business,
right?

17:22.041 --> 17:24.130
- Not if you don't trust
your partners.

17:39.449 --> 17:41.321
- Nah.

17:41.364 --> 17:43.410
- No one even said anything.

17:43.453 --> 17:45.107
- Something off
with your energy.

17:45.151 --> 17:47.675
- We need a loan.

17:47.718 --> 17:50.330
It's collateral.

17:50.373 --> 17:51.635
- How much you after?

17:51.679 --> 17:53.072
- 30 grand.

17:53.115 --> 17:54.812
- For what?

17:54.856 --> 17:56.988
- Independent contractor.

17:58.381 --> 18:00.949
- You doing a remodel?

18:00.992 --> 18:03.430
- Teardown.

18:03.473 --> 18:04.996
- I mean, it's smarter
to go through your bank

18:05.040 --> 18:08.652
or your credit union
for a home equity loan.

18:08.696 --> 18:12.743
- That's not possible.

18:12.787 --> 18:15.790
- You gonna pay
through the nose here.

18:18.314 --> 18:21.839
- It's for a hitman, okay?

18:21.883 --> 18:24.103
Or we could just waste time
on finance metaphors,

18:24.146 --> 18:26.235
and the next thing you know,
we're back in that van.

18:32.241 --> 18:34.069
- So you're looking
for a personal advance.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.027
- Right.

18:36.071 --> 18:37.290
- Yeah.

18:37.333 --> 18:38.595
It's not enough collateral
in the world

18:38.639 --> 18:40.336
for a loan like that.

18:40.380 --> 18:41.729
- Why?

18:41.772 --> 18:43.339
- I mean, when you end up dead,

18:43.383 --> 18:46.081
which it sounds like there's
a real strong chance of,

18:46.125 --> 18:48.649
guess who gets stuck
with the tab.

18:50.041 --> 18:52.566
- Metaphor would've taken
five seconds longer.

18:52.609 --> 18:55.264
- And been way more effective.

18:55.308 --> 18:58.006
- Why don't y'all dust off
those pretty OJ masks of yours?

18:58.049 --> 19:00.095
- Like I've been saying.
- We don't do that anymore.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.184
- Why?

19:02.228 --> 19:04.143
- Because we've evolved.

19:05.448 --> 19:07.189
We're entrepreneurs now.

19:07.233 --> 19:08.625
- With no money.

19:08.669 --> 19:10.018
- We are not gonna rob
your store, Annie.

19:10.061 --> 19:11.889
- Dude, it would be so easy.

19:11.933 --> 19:13.413
I would do it myself
if there weren't cameras.

19:13.456 --> 19:14.588
- How easy?

19:14.631 --> 19:16.981
- Like, no security.
In and out.

19:17.025 --> 19:19.767
It would take longer
to fill up a Slurpee.

19:19.810 --> 19:22.422
- Like Lionel Richie easy?

19:22.465 --> 19:23.640
- I literally just need someone

19:23.684 --> 19:26.208
to hand the cash to
that isn't me.

19:27.731 --> 19:29.733
- Okay, I see.

19:29.777 --> 19:32.954
You know, I wish you all
would've led with that.

19:32.997 --> 19:34.477
I might be able
to help y'all after all.

19:34.521 --> 19:37.045
- Really?

19:37.088 --> 19:39.003
Is there a different
kind of loan?

19:39.047 --> 19:42.006
- Everybody, on the floor!

19:42.050 --> 19:44.095
- Chill.
It's just me.

19:44.139 --> 19:46.707
Better give me that money,
bitch.

19:50.276 --> 19:53.714
- In and out.
Quicker than pouring a Slurpee.

19:53.757 --> 19:56.804
- I mean,
how big is this damn Slurpee?

19:59.285 --> 20:01.112
- Bogey on our left.

20:01.156 --> 20:03.550
- Showtime.

20:05.987 --> 20:08.424
Hi, do you have time
to save abandoned babies?

20:08.468 --> 20:09.904
- Uh, kind of in a hurry.

20:09.947 --> 20:11.775
- You can't spare a moment?

20:11.819 --> 20:14.517
- For abandoned babies?

20:15.475 --> 20:16.737
- I just want to get a water.

20:16.780 --> 20:18.260
- You know who would love
a water?

20:18.304 --> 20:19.696
- The more than 22,000 infants

20:19.740 --> 20:22.830
that are thrown in dumpsters
every year.

20:22.873 --> 20:26.834
- Um, definitely against that.
I just...

20:28.662 --> 20:30.446
- I'm happy to work
a volume discount.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.579
How many units
are we talking about?

20:32.622 --> 20:34.363
- Dean, I need a word.
- Sounds great.

20:34.407 --> 20:35.625
You name the time,

20:35.669 --> 20:38.149
and I will have my guys
there to install.

20:38.193 --> 20:40.369
- Now.

20:40.413 --> 20:42.371
- You know what, Richard?
Let me get into this,

20:42.415 --> 20:44.634
and I'll call you right back.

20:44.678 --> 20:46.984
Great. All right, thanks.
Bye.

20:47.028 --> 20:48.159
I just don't get why
all that money

20:48.203 --> 20:49.291
has to go back to corporate.

20:49.335 --> 20:50.727
- So you're calling
the shots now?

20:50.771 --> 20:52.294
- No,
but I can't make my numbers

20:52.338 --> 20:53.730
just selling barbecue tongs.

20:53.774 --> 20:55.558
- And I can't have my men
going rogue.

20:55.602 --> 20:57.168
It's not how we do things here.

20:57.212 --> 20:59.214
- Oh, I know.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.694
- What's that supposed to mean?

21:00.737 --> 21:03.436
- I think
you know what it means.

21:05.046 --> 21:07.309
- Pack up your desk.

21:07.353 --> 21:09.485
- Seriously?

21:09.529 --> 21:12.488
- Forward me
your open projects.

21:12.532 --> 21:14.185
- That's how
you're gonna play this?

21:14.229 --> 21:17.276
- Keys in the night box.

21:20.017 --> 21:21.541
- No.

21:21.584 --> 21:24.326
- Excuse me?
- No.

21:24.370 --> 21:25.806
- No, what, Dean?

21:25.849 --> 21:28.635
- I'm not gonna pretend
like you're firing me

21:28.678 --> 21:31.246
for a legit work reason
when the truth is

21:31.290 --> 21:35.119
you're only pissed off
'cause I won't tap that.

21:35.163 --> 21:38.601
- Get out of my office.
- Oh, come on, Gayle.

21:38.645 --> 21:40.908
- I'm about to call corporate
and have you blacklisted

21:40.951 --> 21:42.997
from every showroom
in the country.

21:43.040 --> 21:45.304
- Great.
Put it on speaker.

21:45.347 --> 21:46.783
- What?

21:46.827 --> 21:50.265
- I'll tell them how you
promote using only your vagina.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.223
- You think I'm Roger Ailes?

21:52.267 --> 21:54.356
No one cares about me.

21:54.400 --> 21:57.403
And they certainly
don't care about you.

21:57.446 --> 22:00.188
- They care about Eric.
He's a lifer.

22:00.231 --> 22:02.712
- So?
- So he knows everything.

22:02.756 --> 22:05.367
- Why would he risk
his job for you?

22:05.411 --> 22:09.066
- Because I promised him yours
once I get you out.

22:09.110 --> 22:11.721
So here's what's gonna happen.
I'm gonna walk back over there.

22:11.765 --> 22:14.550
I'm gonna complete that sale
you so rudely interrupted.

22:14.594 --> 22:16.378
I'm gonna take
another of Jeff's leads

22:16.422 --> 22:18.075
and another and another
and I'm gonna turn

22:18.119 --> 22:20.904
this joke of an operation
into the number one leader

22:20.948 --> 22:23.994
in Southeast Michigan's
regional sales.

22:28.738 --> 22:31.828
Open or closed?
- Leave.

22:33.264 --> 22:34.396
- Is there a website
I can go to?

22:34.440 --> 22:36.442
- Your donation today

22:36.485 --> 22:39.096
helps get a baby
out of the trash.

22:39.140 --> 22:40.141
- I don't have any cash on me.

22:40.184 --> 22:41.229
- How were you gonna buy
the water?

22:41.272 --> 22:42.578
- We're happy to take a card.

22:44.493 --> 22:46.626
- Maybe next time.

22:49.585 --> 22:52.719
- How much longer
can we do this?

22:57.506 --> 22:59.421
- Deep breaths.
Everybody just stay calm.

22:59.465 --> 23:00.944
We can figure this out.

23:00.988 --> 23:04.034
- Don't worry, ladies.
I'm licensed to carry.

23:09.997 --> 23:11.564
- Where is it?
- Get out of here.

23:11.607 --> 23:12.826
- Not until I get it all back.

23:12.869 --> 23:14.567
- Hey, man,
we don't want any trouble.

23:14.610 --> 23:15.872
- Yeah? Well,
you should've told her that

23:15.916 --> 23:17.439
before she cleaned out
my wife's jewelry box.

23:17.483 --> 23:18.745
- What's he talking about?

23:18.788 --> 23:20.399
- So go to Cartier
and buy her some more.

23:20.442 --> 23:21.704
- Or I'll just go to the cops.

23:21.748 --> 23:23.706
- Okay, yeah, then they can
take my statement.

23:23.750 --> 23:26.579
I'm not gonna leave out
any details for your wife.

23:41.202 --> 23:42.551
- That was my soup.

23:42.595 --> 23:44.423
- Oh. Oops.
Sorry.

23:44.466 --> 23:46.163
- What the hell was that?

23:46.207 --> 23:47.861
- Those guys are all dicks.

23:47.904 --> 23:50.472
- Is that where the money
came from?

23:50.516 --> 23:52.474
- I'm doing his wife a favor.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.302
He's gonna replace it
with something better.

23:54.345 --> 23:56.478
- What do you got me
involved in?

23:56.522 --> 23:58.001
- These guys are all the same,
okay?

23:58.045 --> 23:59.699
They send their wives
off to New York to see

23:59.742 --> 24:01.527
"Dear Evan Hansen"
while they hump Detroit.

24:01.570 --> 24:04.094
- Jesus, Krystal.

24:04.138 --> 24:06.314
- They totally deserve it.

24:06.357 --> 24:08.098
- And how much of my cut
is from Cartier?

24:08.142 --> 24:09.491
- All of it.

24:09.535 --> 24:12.363
They don't tip, either.

24:14.148 --> 24:17.543
- I got another one this
weekend if you're still down.

24:22.199 --> 24:25.028
- Do either of you ladies
have a phone?

24:25.072 --> 24:28.379
- Because I don't.

24:28.423 --> 24:31.078
- Mine's in my truck.

24:31.121 --> 24:33.994
- Uh...

24:34.037 --> 24:37.432
let me look.
- Hands where I can see 'em!

24:37.476 --> 24:40.435
- Okay, go ahead, honey.

24:40.479 --> 24:43.133
- Nothing's been stolen, right?

24:43.177 --> 24:45.179
- Not a dime.

24:45.222 --> 24:47.137
- Okay.

24:49.226 --> 24:51.533
How about...

24:51.577 --> 24:55.232
before this gets real ugly,

24:55.276 --> 24:56.843
we just...

24:56.886 --> 24:59.236
let him go?

24:59.280 --> 25:00.324
- Huh?

25:00.368 --> 25:03.240
- Yeah,
that sounds about right.

25:03.284 --> 25:04.415
- He looks sorry.

25:04.459 --> 25:08.289
- You have no idea.

25:08.332 --> 25:11.205
- Call the cops.

25:18.517 --> 25:19.866
- What?

25:19.909 --> 25:21.084
- What?

25:21.128 --> 25:23.522
- No bars.

25:23.565 --> 25:24.914
- Hey!

25:27.134 --> 25:30.529
- Is everyone okay?

25:30.572 --> 25:32.705
- No.

25:42.802 --> 25:44.412
- Okay, thank you.
They're on their way.

25:44.455 --> 25:45.500
- What do I do?

25:45.544 --> 25:46.501
What do I do?
- Okay, thank you.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.416
Try to stop the bleeding.
- How?

25:48.459 --> 25:49.591
- Can I get a Gatorade?

25:49.635 --> 25:51.114
- Anything you want,
baby girl.

25:51.158 --> 25:53.769
- When you get your permit,
it's just a stupid class.

25:53.813 --> 25:55.031
- The green kind.

25:55.075 --> 25:56.163
- They don't let you practice.

25:56.206 --> 25:57.817
- Get the woman a Gatorade,
Jason.

25:57.860 --> 26:00.080
- Okay, okay.
All right.

26:00.123 --> 26:01.908
- Okay, okay.
- Can you make it tighter?

26:01.951 --> 26:03.474
- Trying. I'm trying.

26:03.518 --> 26:04.475
- Where's my drink?

26:04.519 --> 26:06.608
- Okay, they're out of green.

26:06.652 --> 26:07.914
- They're out of green,
baby girl.

26:07.957 --> 26:09.742
Anything else sound good, huh?

26:09.785 --> 26:11.047
- Frappuccino.
Mocha.

26:11.091 --> 26:13.484
- Frap! Mocha!
- Uh, got it.

26:13.528 --> 26:15.530
- This isn't working.
There's still too much blood.

26:15.574 --> 26:18.141
- Okay. Sponges.
Aisle three.

26:18.185 --> 26:20.056
And behind that,
Saran wrap.

26:20.100 --> 26:21.928
Here we go.

26:21.971 --> 26:24.887
Ice scrapers.
Back wall.

26:24.931 --> 26:27.716
You want a straw, mama?
Huh? Does that sound yum?

26:27.760 --> 26:29.457
- Am I gonna make it?

26:29.500 --> 26:31.241
- Will you shut up
and drink your frap?

26:31.285 --> 26:32.286
Here we go.
This is it.

26:32.329 --> 26:34.462
It's go time.

26:34.505 --> 26:36.899
- Need a fluids run up.
And get a blood ox, please.

26:36.943 --> 26:39.336
- Is she gonna be okay?

26:39.380 --> 26:42.775
- Jesus.
Who did this?

26:42.818 --> 26:44.167
- Why?

26:44.211 --> 26:46.256
- You?

26:46.300 --> 26:47.867
Bullet almost nicked
the femoral artery.

26:47.910 --> 26:48.781
I mean, you saved her leg.

26:48.824 --> 26:49.825
- I did?

26:49.869 --> 26:51.044
- Maybe her life.

26:53.873 --> 26:57.093
- Oh, no.
- Let's go.

26:57.137 --> 26:59.095
- Someone call Stan.

26:59.139 --> 27:01.271
- Of course.

27:10.890 --> 27:11.934
- Dial it down a notch.

27:11.978 --> 27:14.110
- "Lionel Richie easy"?

27:14.154 --> 27:15.938
- No one knows you were there.

27:15.982 --> 27:17.766
- We even did it on a Sunday.

27:17.810 --> 27:19.289
- Yeah, because we don't get
deliveries on Sundays.

27:19.333 --> 27:20.421
- Until you did.

27:20.464 --> 27:22.118
- He was
supposed to come tomorrow.

27:22.162 --> 27:24.294
- And I asked for a knife.

27:24.338 --> 27:25.513
- Yeah, well,
what the hell is that?

27:25.556 --> 27:28.168
- This is something
you split a bagel with.

27:28.211 --> 27:29.473
- What do I look like?
Rambo?

27:29.517 --> 27:32.694
- Okay, I did the job.
I want my cut.

27:32.738 --> 27:34.696
- Okay.

27:38.221 --> 27:40.528
- I'm sorry,
what the hell are you doing?

27:40.571 --> 27:42.704
- What's 10% of zero, again?

27:42.748 --> 27:46.012
Oh, yeah, zero!

27:46.055 --> 27:49.015
- I believe I'm owed something
for my pain and suffering.

27:49.058 --> 27:52.409
- You know, at least you didn't
take a bullet like your girl.

27:54.760 --> 27:56.675
- Bunny got shot?

27:59.808 --> 28:01.984
She gonna be okay?

28:02.028 --> 28:03.812
- Yeah.

28:03.856 --> 28:05.858
Thanks to me.

28:05.901 --> 28:07.598
- You are a lucky lady.

28:08.556 --> 28:10.993
- 'Cause I got you.

28:11.037 --> 28:13.953
- You got grazed.

28:16.390 --> 28:18.044
- Want to know what happened?

28:18.087 --> 28:19.959
- Mm...mm-mm.

28:20.002 --> 28:22.744
Not now.

28:22.788 --> 28:25.312
- Did you get
the hospital bill?

28:25.355 --> 28:27.575
- Can't look.

28:27.618 --> 28:31.405
- I told those ambulance guys
I'd get an Uber.

28:31.448 --> 28:34.190
- After being shot?

28:34.234 --> 28:35.278
- I'd have got an SUV.

28:37.585 --> 28:40.283
- At least the crutches
were free.

28:40.327 --> 28:42.372
- Yeah, I stole those.
- What?

28:42.416 --> 28:43.417
- They were just
sitting by themselves

28:43.460 --> 28:45.462
next to the elevator.
- Stanley.

28:45.506 --> 28:48.117
- They wanted to charge us
400 bucks for them things.

28:49.336 --> 28:51.294
- Hey, how's the patient?

28:51.338 --> 28:53.035
- Flying high on painkillers.

28:53.079 --> 28:57.083
- Ooh. What color are they?

28:57.126 --> 28:59.128
- Hey.
- Oh, blues and yellows.

28:59.172 --> 29:01.565
You must be feeling good.
- What feels good is--

29:01.609 --> 29:04.699
- It wasn't supposed to--
- Yeah, tell that to my kids.

29:04.743 --> 29:06.614
- The universe
has balanced itself.

29:06.657 --> 29:08.224
Telling you,
it's karma.

29:08.268 --> 29:10.966
- Dude, you gotta hear this.

29:11.010 --> 29:14.056
- Remind you
of any Canadians you know?

29:14.100 --> 29:16.319
- Oh, stop.

29:16.363 --> 29:19.192
- I shot a man.
A man shot me.

29:19.235 --> 29:22.586
- I don't think the universe
is keeping score for Big Mike.

29:22.630 --> 29:24.371
- The circle is complete.

29:24.414 --> 29:27.896
- Well, almost.

29:27.940 --> 29:29.245
I did save your life.

29:29.289 --> 29:31.813
- Now I wish
you had let me bleed out.

29:35.251 --> 29:36.644
- So what do we do here?

29:36.687 --> 29:38.951
- Well, JT says he's down
to try again if we are.

29:38.994 --> 29:40.169
- Are you out of your mind?

29:40.213 --> 29:42.432
- Well, his nephew
still needs a saxophone.

29:42.476 --> 29:43.912
- We are done with that.

29:43.956 --> 29:46.436
- Okay, so we just go sit
on the curb

29:46.480 --> 29:48.438
and wait for the van
to pull up?

29:48.482 --> 29:49.439
Because, you know,
that's what happens

29:49.483 --> 29:51.920
when you steal from a gang.

29:51.964 --> 29:55.489
- We should let tampon boy
take his shot.

29:55.532 --> 29:57.752
- Yeah, and then he misses,
and gosh,

29:57.796 --> 29:59.536
this looks familiar.
Where am I?

29:59.580 --> 30:03.018
Oh, I'm back in the van
with all y'all.

30:03.062 --> 30:04.411
- He might not miss.

30:04.454 --> 30:07.631
- Max-y Pad's gonna miss.

30:07.675 --> 30:10.417
- Have you ever fired it?

30:13.202 --> 30:14.421
- When I was little.

30:14.464 --> 30:16.336
- With bullets?

30:19.165 --> 30:21.820
Well...

30:21.863 --> 30:23.430
we'll just
walk through the basics.

- Are you mad?

35:47.493 --> 35:50.191
- My kids do it all the time.

35:50.235 --> 35:51.932
- Not about that.

35:54.021 --> 35:57.067
- It wouldn't have made you
feel better.

36:00.636 --> 36:03.552
Just makes you feel nothing.

36:05.946 --> 36:07.817
- That sounds nice.

36:11.038 --> 36:14.259
- It's not.

36:14.302 --> 36:16.130
- How do you know?

36:17.827 --> 36:20.700
I just know.

36:23.355 --> 36:27.010
- Can I ask
for one thing, please?

36:27.054 --> 36:29.535
- But we just got her.

36:31.406 --> 36:33.626
- I know.

36:35.062 --> 36:38.370
- You can have my allowance
to buy her food.

36:40.807 --> 36:44.202
- Sweetie,
it's not about money.

36:44.245 --> 36:46.160
- I'll clean her cage.

36:48.336 --> 36:50.164
- Where's Emma?

36:50.208 --> 36:53.080
- She says she doesn't care.

36:55.082 --> 36:57.911
- Well, Mommy didn't know...

36:57.954 --> 37:01.697
but Dorito
already had a family.

37:01.741 --> 37:03.264
- Then why'd they give her up?

37:03.308 --> 37:04.744
- We love her.

37:04.787 --> 37:09.009
- She was sick,
and we made her better.

37:09.052 --> 37:13.274
- And now she has to go home
to her real family.

37:13.318 --> 37:16.016
- Aren't we her real family?

37:19.585 --> 37:23.589
- Well, you know what?

37:23.632 --> 37:25.895
We'll get another pet.

37:25.939 --> 37:28.420
- We will?

37:32.815 --> 37:35.253
- Only this time,
you choose.

37:35.296 --> 37:37.603
Anything you want.

37:42.303 --> 37:43.261
both: Snake.

37:43.304 --> 37:45.088
- Yes!

37:47.352 --> 37:50.920
- How about a gerbil?

37:50.964 --> 37:52.182
Or a hamster?

37:52.226 --> 37:54.184
Oh, remember that cute rabbit
that you wanted

37:54.228 --> 37:55.273
from the farmer's market?

37:55.316 --> 37:56.926
- Yeah.

37:56.970 --> 37:58.537
- And then we can feed him
to the snake.

37:58.580 --> 38:00.103
- Yeah!

38:00.147 --> 38:01.148
- Let's go look up snakes.

38:01.191 --> 38:03.672
- Yeah, let's go.

38:07.937 --> 38:10.505
- I'm sorry.

38:10.549 --> 38:14.814
- This is the last thing
he takes from us.

38:14.857 --> 38:16.294
Hey, kids, movie night.

38:16.337 --> 38:20.472
Sam Jackson on a plane.
It's educational.

38:24.345 --> 38:26.826
- Hey, Stanimal.
- You want in?

38:26.869 --> 38:29.611
- Make sure not melds drop out
of your G-string this time.

38:29.655 --> 38:31.657
- If I do this,
I'ma do it right.

38:31.700 --> 38:33.398
Always two parties.

38:33.441 --> 38:35.269
First one,
you earn their trust.

38:35.313 --> 38:37.532
You treat 'em like kings
while I case the castle.

38:37.576 --> 38:38.794
Then say you
had such a great time,

38:38.838 --> 38:40.318
you're gonna come back,
bring more girls.

38:40.361 --> 38:42.232
Do it up.

38:42.276 --> 38:43.973
That's when we take 'em down.

38:44.017 --> 38:46.585
But only
the most expensive piece.

38:46.628 --> 38:48.021
'Cause with one,

38:48.064 --> 38:51.677
they're rich enough to think
they just lost it.

38:51.720 --> 38:53.940
Let me know what time Saturday.

38:56.116 --> 38:58.118
- Stan.

39:00.250 --> 39:02.775
Are you sure?

39:04.820 --> 39:06.605
- We're talking two horsepower,

39:06.648 --> 39:09.434
zero to 60 in half a day.

39:09.477 --> 39:10.609
- What?

39:12.872 --> 39:14.352
- But faster
than them damn crutches.

39:18.268 --> 39:20.401
Careful. Watch the corner.
Watch the corner!

39:20.445 --> 39:22.185
Hey.

39:23.535 --> 39:25.232
That might've been a mistake.

39:25.275 --> 39:27.277
- How'd you get insurance
to cover it?

39:29.062 --> 39:30.280
- All right.
- Have to go so bad.

39:30.324 --> 39:31.325
- I know, I know, I know.
Give him the keys.

39:31.369 --> 39:32.805
- Here, here, here.

39:32.848 --> 39:33.762
- There you go.
There you go.

39:33.806 --> 39:36.286
Go, go, go, go.
