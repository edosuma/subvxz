WEBVTT

00:08.090 --> 00:09.301
You lied.

00:10.552 --> 00:15.641
Every word you have ever said to me
has been a lie.

00:20.604 --> 00:23.899
You're kicking me back to the street
where you found me.

00:25.651 --> 00:26.735
That's not true.

00:26.818 --> 00:29.571
If I were a dog, you'd get a fine.

00:30.531 --> 00:31.740
But who cares about me?

00:35.494 --> 00:36.912
Why don't we sit?

00:37.788 --> 00:40.207
And let's just talk about it.
I know you're angry.

00:40.290 --> 00:41.917
You betrayed me.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.879
Aames told me things
only you could have told him.

00:45.963 --> 00:48.799
-Ramon--
-Don't say a word.

00:49.383 --> 00:52.094
There is nothing you can say.

00:52.761 --> 00:54.346
Let's just talk.

00:55.931 --> 00:57.349
You're safe with me.

00:57.432 --> 00:58.809
That's a fucking joke!

00:59.768 --> 01:00.894
You told me--

01:00.978 --> 01:05.566
You told those kids that worship you
that you're a safe place.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.776
You're a liar.

01:08.527 --> 01:10.153
You need to let go of me.

01:10.237 --> 01:12.865
You would've been a terrible mother.

01:14.533 --> 01:15.617
Don't say that.

01:15.701 --> 01:17.870
Joshua hated you.

01:18.662 --> 01:20.038
That's not true.

01:20.122 --> 01:21.290
Yes, it is.

01:21.373 --> 01:24.376
I can see it on your face
that you know it is.

01:32.426 --> 01:33.635
Oh, my God.

01:36.263 --> 01:38.390
Get out! Get out of my house!

01:38.473 --> 01:39.391
Get out!

01:43.312 --> 01:44.313
Oh, God.

03:01.181 --> 03:05.143
Ingram, she texted me freaked-out
about Ramon, so I drove out here.

03:05.227 --> 03:07.229
That's not your job.

03:08.063 --> 03:09.690
Joshua's not here to do it.

03:09.773 --> 03:11.358
-I know that.
-Do you?

03:11.441 --> 03:15.737
'Cause right now, you're dogging me
about making sure my friend is safe.

03:15.821 --> 03:20.075
Look, don't put that on me, Poppy.
This is the same silly shit that--

03:20.158 --> 03:21.535
-Silly shit?
-Yes.

03:21.618 --> 03:24.413
You're being sued
because of this recklessness.

03:24.496 --> 03:28.083
Wow. Wow. Okay.

03:29.168 --> 03:31.295
You know what,
I can't deal with this right now.

03:31.378 --> 03:32.754
Look, you need to deal with it.

03:32.838 --> 03:35.048
Alana Cave is trying
to take everything we have.

03:35.132 --> 03:37.426
Not just what you have. What we have.

03:37.509 --> 03:40.679
This puts the house, our savings,
all that in jeopardy.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.639
And you're gonna hand it right to her.

03:46.476 --> 03:47.644
I gotta go.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.772
Poppy, what's going on? Call--

04:39.154 --> 04:42.199
Like I said, he just got fired today.
So I saw him earlier.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.785
-He's her ex-assistant, so--
-I'm not pressing charges.

04:46.745 --> 04:49.414
Ramon's in pain.
He didn't know what he was doing.

04:49.498 --> 04:51.250
So you can go now.

04:51.917 --> 04:53.168
All right, fellas, I will--

04:53.252 --> 04:55.921
I'll give you a call
if I get any more information, all right?

04:56.004 --> 04:58.131
-You got it. Have a good night.
-Thanks. Be safe.

05:02.135 --> 05:06.223
Look, you have to change
your security codes, all right?

05:06.682 --> 05:08.559
He has all your information.

05:08.642 --> 05:11.019
He knows me too well. He'll figure it out.

05:11.103 --> 05:13.188
This is why you need a security detail.

05:13.272 --> 05:15.190
Security is not gonna fix this.

05:16.358 --> 05:17.693
It's personal.

05:21.363 --> 05:22.865
Can I holler at you for a second?

05:23.949 --> 05:24.950
Sure.

05:29.454 --> 05:30.539
What's going on?

05:31.999 --> 05:33.959
She's a problem, okay?

05:34.042 --> 05:35.961
Her whole steelo pisses me off.

05:36.628 --> 05:38.172
She's scared, okay?

05:38.255 --> 05:42.718
What if Ramon killed Joshua and Drew,
thinking they were having an affair?

05:42.801 --> 05:46.430
Well, if he did do it, then we really need
to take precautions right now.

05:46.513 --> 05:47.514
Right now.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.017
Hold on one second.

05:54.146 --> 05:55.147
What?

06:00.611 --> 06:03.530
-You need to let the police handle that.
-I will. I will.

06:03.614 --> 06:04.615
You know, I just…

06:06.283 --> 06:08.493
I feel kinda responsible for the kid.

06:08.577 --> 06:11.830
I had to fire him and serve him
with an eviction notice.

06:12.664 --> 06:14.166
Just be careful.

06:14.249 --> 06:15.876
-Yeah.
-Micah?

06:17.669 --> 06:19.254
What the hell happened?

06:21.131 --> 06:22.132
Ramon.

06:23.467 --> 06:24.968
He's furious with me,

06:25.928 --> 06:30.140
and then, I mean, things just got weird.

06:30.224 --> 06:32.976
Micah, he broke into your house, okay?
He threatened you.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.895
That's not weird. That's dangerous.

06:34.978 --> 06:36.188
What did the police say?

06:36.271 --> 06:39.942
The police didn't say anything.
I mean, she's not pressing any charges.

06:40.025 --> 06:41.652
-Markus.
-No, I'm--

06:41.735 --> 06:43.904
Look, they can't do any good
and neither can I,

06:43.987 --> 06:45.656
if she doesn't take this thing seriously.

06:45.739 --> 06:48.700
Now, I don't know
if you can talk some sense into her.

06:48.784 --> 06:53.205
I don't know, but, look, I--
I gotta go, all right?

06:53.747 --> 06:55.082
I'll call you later.

07:20.232 --> 07:21.942
Stupid. Stupid.

07:25.028 --> 07:26.029
Okay.

07:50.429 --> 07:52.264
-Aames.
-This is Aames. Yeah?

07:52.347 --> 07:54.391
-What's up, man? It's Markus.
-Who's this?

07:54.474 --> 07:56.059
-Markus?
-Killebrew.

07:56.143 --> 07:59.146
Listen, I'm here
at Ramon Tomas's apartment.

07:59.229 --> 08:01.732
-What are you doing there?
-Yeah. Yeah, something's up.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.901
-What's happening?
-Can you come meet me here?

08:03.984 --> 08:05.944
-What's happening?
-Yeah, I'll fill you in.

08:08.238 --> 08:09.239
Markus?

08:10.449 --> 08:12.075
-Markus, what's happening?
-Holy shit.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.161
Markus.

08:15.329 --> 08:17.623
Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

08:17.706 --> 08:20.375
Ramon. Hey, hey, stay with me, all right?

08:20.459 --> 08:22.419
I'm gonna get you some help.
Just hang in there.

08:22.503 --> 08:25.839
I don't wanna go.

08:25.923 --> 08:27.382
Oh, shit.

08:27.466 --> 08:29.426
Just hang on, all right?
Come on, I got you.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.304
I got you. Come on.

08:40.604 --> 08:43.941
Motherfuckers, stop recording
and call 911, goddamn it.

08:46.401 --> 08:48.862
Hey. Hey.

08:48.946 --> 08:50.030
Call 911.

08:50.113 --> 08:53.200
Hey, you in the hat, stop! Get back here.

08:53.283 --> 08:54.284
Hey!

09:02.417 --> 09:03.710
-Hey, are you okay?
-I'm fine.

09:03.794 --> 09:04.962
You all right? You sure?

09:05.045 --> 09:06.255
I'm sorry about that.

09:09.508 --> 09:10.717
Oh, shit!

09:16.056 --> 09:17.891
Thanks, Herbie. I'll lock up.

09:17.975 --> 09:19.726
-Good night.
-Night.

09:56.013 --> 09:58.849
If the bottom beat in New Orleans is jazz,

09:59.766 --> 10:01.226
then Oakland is '70s funk.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.609
Beautiful women, good food,

10:09.818 --> 10:12.070
but nothing beats that wide-open road.

10:12.738 --> 10:15.866
Cane field on one side,
bayou on the other.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.084
Moss?

10:26.168 --> 10:27.294
Uncle.

10:30.589 --> 10:31.798
Son.

10:34.551 --> 10:36.970
Man, I ain't seen you in how long?

10:38.555 --> 10:41.266
-You wasn't at your father's funeral.
-No, sir.

10:42.017 --> 10:43.685
I ain't wanna remember him that way.

10:45.771 --> 10:47.481
I saw him at the hospital.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.442
He recognized me.
That was good enough for me.

10:51.193 --> 10:52.486
Come on. Sit down.

10:53.695 --> 10:56.406
Man, I've been praying every day
since he passed.

10:59.409 --> 11:01.787
You know,
he used to have to drag me to novena.

11:02.663 --> 11:05.666
Now every city I pass through,
I end up in one.

11:05.749 --> 11:07.292
Lighting a candle for him.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.087
Came by straight from there.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.172
Show up the way you know how.

11:12.256 --> 11:13.757
Appreciate you saying that, Uncle.

11:14.883 --> 11:19.012
Man, your respect,
that meant the world to him.

11:21.890 --> 11:23.600
I miss my brother.

11:28.647 --> 11:29.940
So where you stayin'?

11:30.023 --> 11:33.277
-Just here and there.
-Nah, nah.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.363
No "here and there" when you got family.
We got plenty of room.

11:37.322 --> 11:39.324
-Yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

11:40.826 --> 11:42.494
It's good to see you, son.

11:50.169 --> 11:53.380
Tell me about the guy you chased.
You get a look at his face?

11:53.463 --> 11:55.424
No. Profile.

11:56.175 --> 11:59.636
He had a hat on.
I didn't get to see his eyes.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.972
But he was tall as fuck.
I'll tell you that.

12:02.806 --> 12:04.391
Could you pick him in a lineup?

12:05.559 --> 12:06.768
I think so.

12:07.311 --> 12:11.899
See, the thing is, I felt like
I recognized the dude, you know?

12:11.982 --> 12:13.525
I just can't place him.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.986
Well, it could be a boyfriend or an ex.

12:16.612 --> 12:17.613
Could be.

12:17.696 --> 12:19.948
Someone turned over
the whole place looking for something.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.626
I'll leave you to it.

12:31.668 --> 12:35.881
Hey, before you go, can I ask
a question about Poppy Parnell?

12:36.548 --> 12:37.758
She's not the killer.

12:39.551 --> 12:40.886
Do you trust her?

12:42.638 --> 12:46.016
More than almost anyone.
But don't tell her I said that.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.100
Right.

12:47.184 --> 12:50.979
'Cause I don't work with civilians,
but I am finding her very hard to…

12:51.980 --> 12:53.524
to avoid.

12:54.608 --> 12:57.903
Well, how can I put this?
You know how a…

12:58.904 --> 13:02.908
a pit bull locks their jaw
when they get ahold of something?

13:03.492 --> 13:04.826
-That's her.
-Right.

13:04.910 --> 13:06.119
You got some history there?

13:07.454 --> 13:10.541
So deep I think I knew her
in another life.

13:10.624 --> 13:13.752
Look, my advice is this.

13:13.836 --> 13:17.130
If you don't work with Poppy,
she'll work against you.

13:18.215 --> 13:20.467
Trust me, that you don't want.

13:27.474 --> 13:28.851
You still there?

13:28.934 --> 13:32.896
Yeah. Yeah. I'm sorry, Markus.

13:33.689 --> 13:35.524
-You all right?
-No.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.068
What can I do?

13:39.486 --> 13:40.612
Nothing.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.781
Look, I'm here if you wanna talk.

13:42.865 --> 13:45.993
Listen, he didn't fall out of the window,
Poppy. He was pushed.

13:46.076 --> 13:48.287
Most likely by the same guy I chased.

13:48.370 --> 13:50.080
Innocent people, they don't run.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.749
Well, has Aames said anything else?

13:52.833 --> 13:56.211
Yeah, he said someone ransacked
Ramon's apartment looking for something.

13:56.837 --> 13:58.338
Look, I gotta go.

13:58.797 --> 13:59.798
You good?

13:59.882 --> 14:04.011
Micah dismissed my guys, and I don't
have the fucking energy right now,

14:04.094 --> 14:05.345
so just tell her to lock up.

14:06.221 --> 14:07.848
-Will do.
-Cool.

14:14.104 --> 14:15.814
I was horrible to him.

14:16.356 --> 14:20.527
I mean, did I do this?
Did I… push him to jump?

14:20.611 --> 14:22.154
Don't do that to yourself.

14:22.738 --> 14:25.073
And besides,
Markus saw someone running away.

14:25.574 --> 14:27.117
You were scared.

14:27.201 --> 14:29.328
You were protecting yourself.

14:29.870 --> 14:32.789
And Ramon was unraveling.
We don't know what he was up to.

14:32.873 --> 14:34.666
Maybe he let someone dangerous
into his apartment.

14:34.750 --> 14:35.751
Yeah.

14:35.834 --> 14:38.086
So afraid.

14:40.172 --> 14:42.925
I just let it erase
everything he meant to me.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.873
The Shelter family is heartbroken

15:55.956 --> 15:59.418
by the loss of one of our own,
Ramon Tomas.

16:00.586 --> 16:03.964
Ramon came to Shelter
after running away from his broken home.

16:05.132 --> 16:09.595
He was a gifted student who prospered
under the care of the Shelter family.

16:11.889 --> 16:16.435
In this time of grief and loss,
Shelter is here.

16:16.935 --> 16:20.314
Coping resources are available
at our website.

16:38.248 --> 16:39.249
Yeah.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.755
Here's that list of tenants
from the Shelter apartments.

16:44.838 --> 16:46.840
-Thanks.
-Ramon's neighbors.

16:47.883 --> 16:49.510
Maybe they heard something.

16:49.593 --> 16:50.928
How you holding up?

16:55.933 --> 16:58.810
Yeah. Is that Ramon's watch?

17:02.064 --> 17:04.148
Yeah. And his cardigan.

17:05.358 --> 17:07.027
We used to trade clothes sometimes.

17:07.861 --> 17:10.906
This one still smelled like him,
so I felt like wearing it.

17:12.782 --> 17:14.159
Is that weird?

17:14.660 --> 17:19.830
You know, it's only human
to wanna be close to your friend.

17:19.915 --> 17:21.500
You know, you look a little worn-out.

17:21.583 --> 17:24.211
Why don't you take
the rest of the day off? Relax.

17:24.837 --> 17:27.381
Sitting in his energy is part
of the grief protocol.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.843
Plus, Lachlan wants me here at all times.

17:30.926 --> 17:32.344
Lachlan's an asshole.

17:35.055 --> 17:39.476
Look, if he's not being decent to you,
you know you can just quit?

17:44.773 --> 17:45.774
I can't quit.

17:53.699 --> 17:55.367
Come on. Walk with me.

18:00.372 --> 18:02.749
-Hey.
-Hi.

18:05.419 --> 18:07.921
I just can't look at this stuff anymore.

18:08.005 --> 18:09.840
It's like it's suffocating me.

18:16.054 --> 18:20.601
I'm so sorry I made you come
all the way out here,

18:20.684 --> 18:22.895
but I can't do this interview right now.

18:22.978 --> 18:25.564
We're not in a hurry. We can wait.

18:29.234 --> 18:31.069
I'm gonna check the room tone in the back.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.699
What is this one?
This one doesn't belong here.

18:37.034 --> 18:38.493
Talk to me, Micah.

18:39.786 --> 18:43.749
Someone I loved died hating me.

18:52.633 --> 18:54.635
It's the old me. I…

18:57.054 --> 18:59.306
It's like I feel her creeping back in.

19:00.766 --> 19:03.060
Like she wants to take this life from me.

19:06.104 --> 19:07.523
I understand that.

19:11.485 --> 19:12.694
I…

19:14.821 --> 19:18.116
know what it's like
to feel like two people.

19:18.784 --> 19:22.913
Well, you never let the trappings
of success change you.

19:29.127 --> 19:31.922
What? Ingram?

19:34.633 --> 19:37.553
Poppy, if you love him…

19:41.515 --> 19:43.016
fight for it.

19:43.851 --> 19:46.395
Protect it, because once it's gone…

19:47.396 --> 19:50.190
What if it's not strong enough
to fight for anymore?

19:54.778 --> 19:56.947
Do you think we're toxic? The two of us?

19:58.323 --> 19:59.533
That's dangerous.

20:00.784 --> 20:02.077
You didn't say no.

20:05.163 --> 20:08.417
I'm not giving in to that,
and I don't think you should either.

20:10.544 --> 20:13.714
What makes us think that it's up to us,

20:14.214 --> 20:16.800
like, the two of us, to save the world?

20:20.429 --> 20:22.806
What other choice do we have, honey?

20:22.890 --> 20:24.516
Let it all burn down?

20:31.815 --> 20:35.652
Look, just talk to me, okay?
I can help you if you're afraid.

20:37.613 --> 20:38.989
It's not that. It--

20:40.782 --> 20:43.660
It's not like he's stalking
or harassing me.

20:44.953 --> 20:45.954
But?

20:49.208 --> 20:50.709
I'm in a lot of debt.

20:53.045 --> 20:56.048
So, Lachlan was your loan shark?

20:58.425 --> 20:59.843
I stole from Shelter.

21:01.678 --> 21:05.182
The face cream goes for $600,
and I was in charge of inventory,

21:05.265 --> 21:09.895
so I'd take jars here and there
and sell them and pay bills.

21:09.978 --> 21:11.104
And he caught you.

21:12.856 --> 21:13.857
But how?

21:15.234 --> 21:16.777
He has cameras all over the office.

21:17.861 --> 21:22.783
Probably uses whatever he finds
or hears to keep people in line.

21:22.866 --> 21:24.952
He wants to control everything.

21:25.035 --> 21:28.080
Well, do you have any idea
where the cameras are?

21:28.914 --> 21:30.415
Do you know where the footage is?

21:31.208 --> 21:33.585
He doesn't know that I know, but yes.

21:33.669 --> 21:36.171
It's all on hard drives in his office.

21:40.717 --> 21:42.135
I don't wanna go to jail.

21:45.597 --> 21:47.140
What if I gave them to you?

21:51.228 --> 21:53.355
Come on in.
Yeah, I thought it'd be better for us

21:53.438 --> 21:56.942
to do this thing together here, you know,
rather than at the office.

21:57.025 --> 22:00.028
Hidden cameras?
Why the heck was Lachlan spying?

22:00.487 --> 22:01.530
I don't know.

22:04.408 --> 22:05.409
What the hell?

22:11.874 --> 22:13.333
What are you doing home?

22:13.417 --> 22:16.461
I had a free period,
so I came home for a snack.

22:16.545 --> 22:17.546
No, no, no, no.

22:17.629 --> 22:20.090
The school bus doesn't run
in the middle of the day.

22:20.174 --> 22:22.634
-I didn't take the bus.
-So ho--

22:27.055 --> 22:29.600
Dad, this is Aubrey.

22:30.767 --> 22:32.227
Hey, Mr. Killbrew, Mrs. Killbrew.

22:32.311 --> 22:35.898
-Killebrew. It's Killebrew.
-Killebrew.

22:35.981 --> 22:38.275
-No, my name is Poppy Parnell.
-Hey.

22:38.358 --> 22:40.319
Look, I would've told you
I was coming home,

22:40.402 --> 22:42.321
but I didn't think you'd be here.

22:44.239 --> 22:47.784
Well, we ought to get going anyway,
'cause free period's almost over, so.

22:47.868 --> 22:48.827
Hold on.

22:51.455 --> 22:53.332
You crazy? Let me see some ID.

23:06.929 --> 23:08.680
Aubrey Siddons, huh?

23:11.225 --> 23:12.809
Let me holler at you for a minute.

23:14.228 --> 23:17.064
It doesn't matter what my daughter says.

23:17.648 --> 23:21.693
The bottom-line rule here
is no boys in an empty house.

23:22.236 --> 23:24.947
Ever. You understand that?

23:26.490 --> 23:30.410
So that means that either me
or her mother has to be here.

23:31.286 --> 23:34.873
So, just in case that she forgets,

23:34.957 --> 23:38.085
you have all the information you need.

23:38.585 --> 23:40.254
You understand that, right?

23:41.338 --> 23:42.756
Yes, sir. I understand.

23:47.845 --> 23:49.054
You broke the rules.

23:51.223 --> 23:53.559
After school, I want you straight home.

23:54.601 --> 23:55.894
You understand me?

23:57.813 --> 23:58.814
Yes, sir.

24:05.654 --> 24:09.575
So… since when did Trini start dating?

24:09.658 --> 24:12.494
Man, listen.
I don't even wanna think about that.

24:12.578 --> 24:14.413
And I damn sure don't wanna talk about it.

24:15.581 --> 24:17.833
All right. Let's see what we got here.

24:17.916 --> 24:21.712
"Jenna Buccatello. Gary Nguyen.

24:23.088 --> 24:25.549
Maleeka Long."
These are all employees at Shelter.

24:26.049 --> 24:29.678
Please don't tell me we did all this
to find personnel files.

24:30.387 --> 24:32.723
Why would Lachlan need
to hide personnel files?

24:37.519 --> 24:38.562
See this.

24:42.024 --> 24:46.236
Okay. Whatever you do,
do not hit that rewind button.

24:46.320 --> 24:49.698
Well, whatever they are up to,
I'm sure I've seen worse shit in my life.

24:51.491 --> 24:53.452
This is so invasive.

24:55.204 --> 24:57.831
There must be files
on everyone in Shelter here.

24:57.915 --> 24:59.750
He is one creepy motherfucker.

25:01.793 --> 25:04.630
What if Ramon found out
about the surveillance?

25:05.464 --> 25:06.465
Uh-huh?

25:07.299 --> 25:10.385
Ramon finds out about the surveillance,

25:10.469 --> 25:13.222
threatens to expose him,
and Lachlan killed him.

25:14.056 --> 25:17.726
Well, the dude I saw was tall,
but I don't know.

25:17.809 --> 25:19.770
Lachlan doesn't seem like the killer type.

25:19.853 --> 25:22.272
So he hired somebody
to keep his hands clean.

25:22.356 --> 25:24.608
Maybe so. Look at this.

25:25.275 --> 25:27.236
What's this asshole think he's got on me?

25:29.947 --> 25:32.908
But they say it's common
with geriatric pregnancies.

25:35.911 --> 25:38.747
Hey, don't blame me.
I didn't make up the term.

25:38.830 --> 25:41.041
Look, it's gonna be fine. Don't worry.

25:44.503 --> 25:46.171
You're having another baby?

25:47.297 --> 25:48.924
Well, that was meant to be private.

25:49.633 --> 25:51.468
We're not really telling anyone yet,
you know.

25:51.552 --> 25:54.680
Folks tend to get way too involved
in other people's pregnancies.

25:54.763 --> 25:58.892
Look, how about I just
finish up on this on my own,

25:58.976 --> 26:01.770
and then I give you a call
if I find anything?

26:04.147 --> 26:05.148
Okay.

26:18.662 --> 26:19.663
Knock, knock!

26:19.746 --> 26:21.623
Why are you laying
on my doorbell like that?

26:21.707 --> 26:23.000
'Cause I want to.

26:23.667 --> 26:26.044
I'm starving. I hope you cooked.

26:27.754 --> 26:29.715
I ordered from my favorite restaurant.

26:29.798 --> 26:30.924
That's--

26:31.008 --> 26:35.262
But we can use my good china
if that'll make you feel any better.

26:35.345 --> 26:37.973
-You're trifling.
-I accept that about myself.

26:39.057 --> 26:41.351
Come on. I wanna show y'all
something before we eat.

26:42.686 --> 26:45.397
-Y'all both look so cute today.
-Thank you, Poppy.

26:45.480 --> 26:46.690
Thank you, sis.

26:46.773 --> 26:49.151
First time out in California
when I was a kid,

26:49.234 --> 26:52.237
my father was taking us
to the beach out in Alameda.

26:52.946 --> 26:55.949
We were driving through the tube
when a car almost hit us.

26:56.033 --> 26:58.702
My father almost crashed into a wall.

27:00.120 --> 27:01.830
It was a white man driving.

27:02.664 --> 27:05.417
And it nearly scared
the hell out of my mother.

27:06.084 --> 27:08.378
When my father caught up to his car,
the man shouted,

27:08.462 --> 27:11.798
"Boy, watch what the fuck you doing.
Know your place."

27:13.342 --> 27:18.805
So my father motioned for the man
to pull over at an empty field.

27:19.932 --> 27:25.103
My father got out, walked to the car.
Hat in hand, head bowed, subservient.

27:25.187 --> 27:27.189
But when he got to the car,

27:28.023 --> 27:31.568
all I could see was his hands
reaching into the driver's window.

27:31.652 --> 27:34.947
Now, my father,
he had thick workingman's hands.

27:35.030 --> 27:36.323
Hard-days'-work hands.

27:36.406 --> 27:40.077
So he snatched that white man
straight through that window.

27:40.160 --> 27:41.703
His shoes came off.

27:41.787 --> 27:44.081
Dragged him in his socks back to our car,

27:44.164 --> 27:46.875
forced him to look at me
and Noble in the back seat.

27:46.959 --> 27:51.004
Had him by the tie, turned his head,
pointed to us, and told him--

27:51.088 --> 27:53.298
And I'll never forget it
as long as I live.

27:53.882 --> 27:56.218
"Those are my sons.

27:57.469 --> 27:59.263
That one's nine, and he is seven.

27:59.346 --> 28:05.477
Those are boys. I am a motherfucking man!"

28:12.442 --> 28:14.862
That's the righteous anger I knew.

28:16.613 --> 28:18.073
That's what I grew into.

28:20.325 --> 28:22.244
It's also what led me
away from my daughters

28:22.327 --> 28:23.871
when they needed me the most.

28:23.954 --> 28:27.457
You mean when you
were locked up after your wife's death?

28:28.417 --> 28:31.003
Nothing like prison
to make you face your demons.

28:31.795 --> 28:36.425
When Elinor died, I went grief mad

28:36.925 --> 28:42.347
and left my babies to deal
with their mother's death alone.

28:43.682 --> 28:45.684
I'll never forgive myself for that.

28:46.476 --> 28:47.978
By the time I got out of prison,

28:48.061 --> 28:53.358
I realized there was more to
being a man than being hard.

28:54.276 --> 28:55.986
But for my girls…

28:57.696 --> 29:00.365
Sometimes I think it was already too late.

29:06.163 --> 29:10.042
I'm stunned.
I cannot stop rewatching this.

29:10.542 --> 29:11.919
I did the same.

29:12.002 --> 29:15.631
When did he do this?
And how did he do this?

29:15.714 --> 29:17.758
Well, he was working with Josh.

29:17.841 --> 29:22.596
He wanted to leave behind a legacy.
Just in case.

29:23.222 --> 29:25.682
Yeah, well, he's dealing with a lot.

29:26.808 --> 29:30.854
His brother's death hit him hard,
and now he's sick and scared.

29:32.731 --> 29:34.900
Lillian tell y'all one of Noble's sons
is staying with them?

29:34.983 --> 29:37.069
What? Who? Cornelius?

29:37.152 --> 29:39.446
No. The illegitimate.

29:39.530 --> 29:41.615
Moss? You're lying.

29:42.241 --> 29:44.868
No, he came in the bar
completely out of the blue,

29:44.952 --> 29:48.205
acting like the long-lost nephew
and asking all kinds of questions.

29:50.832 --> 29:53.794
-What did Lillian say about him?
-He getting on her nerves.

29:53.877 --> 29:55.504
She said he has a million opinions,

29:55.587 --> 29:58.131
and he keeps egging Daddy on
about grandkids.

29:58.215 --> 30:00.092
-Stop it.
-That is not his business.

30:00.175 --> 30:01.176
Thank you.

30:01.260 --> 30:04.763
You know, I beat the shit outta him
when we were kids.

30:04.847 --> 30:06.390
I remember.

30:06.473 --> 30:09.393
I might have to do it again
if he doesn't stop running his mouth.

30:13.522 --> 30:18.318
So, has Daddy ever asked y'all
about grandbabies?

30:19.611 --> 30:21.780
I told him that
as long as I'm short a partner,

30:21.864 --> 30:23.115
I will be short a baby.

30:24.241 --> 30:27.244
And he knows that I am way too fly,
so he don't even ask me.

30:27.870 --> 30:29.288
And we all know you too fancy.

30:31.874 --> 30:34.209
-Got them fancy curls right now.
-She always fancy.

30:34.293 --> 30:35.836
She got a perm before anybody else.

30:35.919 --> 30:36.920
Oh, yeah.

31:39.483 --> 31:40.692
Hey, hey, sorry.

31:40.776 --> 31:44.363
Hey. So we need to do more depo prep.
Can I come over later?

31:44.446 --> 31:45.739
Sure.

31:46.698 --> 31:47.824
You good?

31:49.701 --> 31:55.707
Yeah, just something
Cydie said yesterday got me thinking

31:55.791 --> 31:59.169
about when we decided not to have kids.

32:00.838 --> 32:01.839
Yeah?

32:02.840 --> 32:04.258
No, no. I'm--

32:04.883 --> 32:06.093
You know, I'm…

32:07.928 --> 32:08.929
just…

32:10.055 --> 32:11.598
just thinking about it.

32:11.682 --> 32:13.433
We decided that.

32:13.517 --> 32:15.894
I know. I'm not saying we didn't.

32:16.854 --> 32:19.106
-See you later?
-Yeah.

32:20.774 --> 32:22.776
You get that valve fixed yet?

32:23.735 --> 32:25.779
-Happy to do it if you want.
-Finding somebody.

32:25.863 --> 32:27.364
Let him fix it if he want.

32:28.365 --> 32:29.449
Good to see you, Moss.

32:31.285 --> 32:33.453
-Settling in?
-Trying to.

32:34.496 --> 32:37.416
-How you doing, Hollywood?
-Don't call me that.

32:37.499 --> 32:39.084
Still sensitive.

32:39.168 --> 32:40.544
You in town long?

32:41.044 --> 32:42.588
Well, I don't know.

32:42.671 --> 32:44.256
Sure hope to be.

32:44.756 --> 32:45.757
You got a visitor.

32:50.554 --> 32:51.889
Fuck.

32:56.268 --> 32:59.396
I like the music here. And the okra.

33:04.026 --> 33:05.944
Lukather Shreveport Scoville.

33:06.028 --> 33:08.447
My government name. You must be a cop.

33:10.032 --> 33:13.535
The word on the street is you lost a step,
but I'm not sure I buy it.

33:13.619 --> 33:15.954
Let me have a moment alone with him.

33:16.872 --> 33:18.290
Please, Daddy. I'm fine.

33:25.172 --> 33:27.257
You investigating the murders
or the Capstones?

33:27.341 --> 33:29.801
Well, just because
I don't work Intelligence anymore

33:29.885 --> 33:31.887
doesn't mean
I don't like to have information.

33:33.764 --> 33:37.851
Your podcast is causing some chaos.

33:37.935 --> 33:39.561
That all you came to say?

33:41.021 --> 33:42.898
I can't stop you from doing your story.

33:42.981 --> 33:45.400
-That we can agree on.
-But I am not the enemy.

33:48.946 --> 33:51.740
You want my help,
but you don't wanna ask me for it.

33:52.324 --> 33:53.534
That about right?

33:59.706 --> 34:01.667
All right. What's your theory on the case?

34:02.334 --> 34:04.169
-Which one?
-Both.

34:05.295 --> 34:07.214
My gut's telling me it's the same killer.

34:07.881 --> 34:10.467
The guy Markus saw with the baseball cap
leaving Ramon's.

34:11.051 --> 34:13.929
-So you think we got a serial killer?
-I can't tell you.

34:14.513 --> 34:15.556
Okay.

34:17.224 --> 34:19.893
Did you find DNA at Ramon's,
and are you testing it

34:19.976 --> 34:22.312
against what you found at Joshua's studio?

34:22.396 --> 34:24.147
-I can't tell you.
-Okay, then this isn't gonna work.

34:24.231 --> 34:27.234
Hey, I don't want the distraction
while I'm trying to do my job, okay.

34:27.317 --> 34:28.318
You're a podcaster--

34:28.402 --> 34:29.695
Journalist.

34:31.112 --> 34:34.449
Neither one of those is
a qualified homicide detective.

34:34.533 --> 34:36.034
What are you gonna do
if you find the killer?

34:36.118 --> 34:37.494
-The right thing.
-Yeah.

34:37.578 --> 34:39.246
Like you did with the Cave case?

34:40.706 --> 34:44.626
Lawsuits are expensive,
and they're also public record.

34:45.710 --> 34:48.463
Good night, Inspector.
Leave a fat-ass tip now.

34:50.299 --> 34:51.425
Herbie, set me up.

34:54.803 --> 34:56.263
Why are we meeting out here?

34:58.182 --> 35:02.144
Lachlan has surveillance cameras
all over Shelter.

35:03.478 --> 35:05.981
The annex, the lobby.

35:07.608 --> 35:09.026
And all the offices.

35:16.867 --> 35:17.951
Did you…

35:20.204 --> 35:21.914
Did you see me in my office?

35:24.625 --> 35:25.626
Yeah.

35:32.299 --> 35:34.927
That's illegal, right? He can't do that.

35:35.010 --> 35:38.680
Well, it's complicated.

35:40.015 --> 35:41.892
What do you mean, "It's complicated"?

35:41.975 --> 35:44.770
Look, if he didn't record
in the bathrooms or the locker rooms,

35:44.853 --> 35:46.688
then technically it's legal.

35:46.772 --> 35:52.361
Now if he were to post it
or to extort you or anyone else,

35:52.903 --> 35:54.947
then it would become illegal.

35:58.325 --> 36:02.955
Look, I asked you to come out here
because I need allies, all right?

36:03.539 --> 36:05.999
Micah's been rejecting my ideas,

36:06.083 --> 36:09.878
and we need open lines of communication,
or more people could get hurt.

36:13.173 --> 36:14.174
Can I trust you?

36:19.847 --> 36:26.645
I used to have a lot of…
unhealthy habits growing up.

36:27.604 --> 36:31.525
I'm not gonna bore you with my sob story.
It's just life was hard.

36:31.608 --> 36:33.527
Indeed. Indeed.

36:33.610 --> 36:36.697
I introduced Lachlan to Micah.

36:37.781 --> 36:40.033
Then when he invested,
we gave him an office.

36:42.536 --> 36:44.746
He was always flirting with me.

36:46.415 --> 36:50.961
But… when Josh died,
I just-- I acted out.

36:55.424 --> 36:57.926
-I made a mistake…
-Yeah.

36:58.010 --> 36:59.761
…but I love my husband.

37:03.015 --> 37:07.394
I'm just really disappointed with myself.
I never thought I would be that person.

37:09.980 --> 37:12.274
It's just that I'm supposed
to be her rock, you know,

37:12.357 --> 37:13.775
and I lied to her.

37:14.902 --> 37:16.153
You have to tell her.

37:18.405 --> 37:19.406
I know.

37:20.657 --> 37:22.951
I know. I'm in charge
of the second chance workers.

37:23.035 --> 37:26.038
Owning mistakes is the baseline
of the program.

37:27.331 --> 37:29.041
I have to take my own advice.

38:16.255 --> 38:18.048
You motherfucker.

38:22.678 --> 38:23.804
Bam. Give me 20.

38:23.887 --> 38:25.764
-You know I'm letting you win, right?
-Bullshit.

38:28.809 --> 38:30.018
Scovilles, what's happening?

38:30.102 --> 38:31.728
Hey, what's going on, Markus?

38:31.812 --> 38:33.230
-What's up, Markus?
-Poppy?

38:33.313 --> 38:34.648
I'll be right back.

38:37.234 --> 38:39.736
Here, have a seat. I think you were right.

38:39.820 --> 38:46.410
I think this could be the guy
that Lachlan hired to kill Ramon.

38:47.202 --> 38:48.537
-Are you serious?
-Yeah, I'm serious.

38:48.620 --> 38:51.623
That's the guy I saw running
out of Ramon's building.

38:51.707 --> 38:54.251
His name is Holt Rollins.
He works at Shelter.

38:54.334 --> 38:56.670
That's how he was able
to get into Ramon's apartment.

38:57.796 --> 38:59.798
-I think I've seen him before.
-What?

38:59.882 --> 39:02.217
Cydie? Cydie, come here.

39:02.301 --> 39:04.469
Wait, what are you talking
about you've seen him before?

39:04.553 --> 39:05.554
Just hold on a minute.

39:06.889 --> 39:08.473
-Cydie, come here. Hurry.
-Yeah.

39:09.308 --> 39:10.726
Does he look familiar?

39:12.477 --> 39:13.854
You found him.

39:14.771 --> 39:16.940
Found who? What's going on?

39:17.774 --> 39:20.402
That's the dude who scared me
on my bus the other day.

39:20.485 --> 39:22.404
-I had to file a complaint.
-Hold on.

39:22.487 --> 39:24.239
So you're saying
you've seen this guy before?

39:24.323 --> 39:25.449
What is she talking about?

39:25.532 --> 39:27.868
Yeah, he scared the shit outta me.
Knew my routes and everything.

39:27.951 --> 39:29.369
This isn't a coincidence.

39:29.453 --> 39:31.330
Your sister got hurt once already.

39:31.413 --> 39:32.915
No, this isn't the same thing, Daddy.

39:32.998 --> 39:35.083
Listen,
I'ma go see if I can find this guy.

39:35.167 --> 39:38.003
-Call Aames. And be careful.
-Will do.

39:38.086 --> 39:39.171
Let me call Micah.

39:39.254 --> 39:40.255
Sweetheart, what's going on?

39:40.339 --> 39:42.966
Listen. Look at this. Him right there.

39:43.050 --> 39:44.676
-This is the cat that--
-Yes.

39:44.760 --> 39:48.055
You've reached Micah Keith.
The world is waiting for your vision.

39:48.138 --> 39:49.932
Hey. Hey, it's me.

39:50.015 --> 39:52.434
I think Markus figured out
who might've killed Ramon.

39:52.518 --> 39:54.728
His name is Holt Rollins.

39:54.811 --> 39:56.813
He's a Shelter employee.

39:56.897 --> 39:58.815
I don't think you need
to be out there alone.

39:58.899 --> 40:01.276
Okay, call me. Call me when you get this.

40:05.405 --> 40:06.406
I'll call you later.

40:12.496 --> 40:13.497
Watch your heads.

40:16.792 --> 40:18.001
Watch your step.

40:18.377 --> 40:19.419
Yeah.

40:19.503 --> 40:20.754
Here it is.

40:40.357 --> 40:41.441
What you got?

40:44.653 --> 40:46.780
-Holy shit.
-Yeah.

41:14.141 --> 41:15.392
We still working tonight?

41:15.475 --> 41:16.727
Hey.

41:16.810 --> 41:19.646
Aames found some creepy shit at
Holt's workshop, but the guy's not here.

41:19.730 --> 41:23.233
-Have you talked to Micah?
-She's not answering her phone.

41:23.317 --> 41:26.195
All right. I'll head out there
as soon as I get Trini situated.

41:26.278 --> 41:27.654
-Okay, I'll meet you there.
-Okay.

41:29.281 --> 41:33.410
Poppy. Call the police.
Do not drive out there.

41:33.493 --> 41:34.620
I have to, Ingram.

41:37.039 --> 41:41.543
You walk out that door,
and I will not be here when you get back.

41:50.844 --> 41:52.721
You know it's over, Poppy.

41:54.181 --> 41:56.808
Neither one of us has been
brave enough to say it.

42:02.689 --> 42:03.732
Don't say that.

42:06.026 --> 42:08.737
Wait, you're gonna leave
if I go help my friend?

42:08.820 --> 42:10.197
You know that's not it.

42:12.533 --> 42:16.036
I don't know how.
I don't even really know why.

42:18.580 --> 42:20.040
But we lost something.

42:24.044 --> 42:26.630
I'll move back to New York with you.

42:26.713 --> 42:29.007
-Come on, baby.
-I love you, Ingram.

42:29.091 --> 42:30.843
And I love you too.

42:32.261 --> 42:34.012
I love you with all my heart.

42:40.561 --> 42:42.104
But have you been happy?

42:44.273 --> 42:45.440
Tell the truth.

42:47.985 --> 42:48.986
No.

42:52.656 --> 42:53.657
Why?

42:55.534 --> 43:00.247
Because I know
that what you don't like is me.

43:01.874 --> 43:03.625
This me.

43:05.085 --> 43:09.923
And that's what I love. This me.

43:13.510 --> 43:14.511
I knew it.

43:15.846 --> 43:17.055
I knew it.

43:17.973 --> 43:19.892
I knew it. I could feel it.

43:21.518 --> 43:26.023
And I tried to fold myself in
and all that did was make me angry.

43:27.441 --> 43:29.151
And the river got wider.

43:33.113 --> 43:35.240
I can't be that woman you want back.

43:36.867 --> 43:38.035
Not even for you.

43:40.871 --> 43:41.872
I know.

43:46.376 --> 43:47.377
I know.

43:53.675 --> 43:57.262
I'm going back to New York.

43:57.346 --> 43:58.972
-When?
-Soon.

44:09.274 --> 44:10.651
Poppy--

44:12.277 --> 44:13.320
Poppy.

45:15.591 --> 45:17.009
If this is an emergency,

45:17.092 --> 45:19.261
-please stay on the line.
-Come on, come on, come on.

45:19.887 --> 45:21.430
911, what's your emergency?

45:21.513 --> 45:23.473
Yes. I need to report an assault.
