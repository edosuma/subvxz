02:23.485 --> 02:27.805
The Pagan King

02:29.165 --> 02:32.205
in the 13th century, pagan tribes inhabit the lands
along the shores of the baltic sea,

02:32.205 --> 02:35.245
and the rich trading nation of Semigallia
has not gone unnoticed by Rome.

02:35.365 --> 02:38.925
The Pope's illegitimate son, Max, seeks his
father's authority to conquer the region.

02:38.925 --> 02:42.645
His only problem is the Semigallians themselves,

02:42.805 --> 02:45.885
brave warriors whose kingdom is a place where
even Vikings had once feared to tread.

02:46.765 --> 02:49.805
Pope's residence

10:52.085 --> 10:54.725
Saaremaa Island

1:44:43.445 --> 1:44:46.005
It took the Crusaders another
hundred years to conquer

1:44:46.005 --> 1:44:48.405
Semigallia but they could
never break its spirit.

1:44:50.205 --> 1:44:53.965
For Namejs taught his people that power
and leadership come not from on high but

1:44:53.965 --> 1:44:57.885
from within, and everyone must take
responsibility for their own path in life.

1:44:59.365 --> 1:45:02.205
To this day, the Ring of Namejs
remains a symbol

1:45:02.205 --> 1:45:04.845
of honesty, bravery and
personal freedom.
