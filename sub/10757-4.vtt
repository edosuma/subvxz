00:20.953 --> 00:23.751
Roz, how are you?

00:24.039 --> 00:26.428
Still pregnant.

00:29.878 --> 00:32.438
I'm sorry about last night.

00:32.714 --> 00:35.512
I tried to apologise,
but you ran out so fast.

00:35.801 --> 00:39.476
I'm sorry. Was that rude? You know
more about etiquette than I do.

00:39.805 --> 00:42.365
What is the proper length of time
you should stay

00:42.641 --> 00:46.111
after someone announces to 100 strangers
that you got knocked up?

00:48.355 --> 00:51.552
- I tried to call.
- I wasn't answering.

00:51.859 --> 00:54.657
I was up all night
thinking about what I want to do.

00:54.945 --> 00:58.221
A decision of that magnitude
would take many sleepless...

00:58.532 --> 01:01.410
- I'm having the baby.
-...hours to make.

01:03.996 --> 01:05.952
Are you sure, Roz?

01:06.206 --> 01:09.801
I know it's quick, but even
when I was hoping I wasn't pregnant,

01:10.127 --> 01:12.846
I knew if I was,
I was keeping the baby.

01:13.130 --> 01:15.598
Then let me be the first
to congratulate you.

01:18.051 --> 01:20.611
It's so wonderful.
You'll make a great mom.

01:21.305 --> 01:24.502
I did the first step pretty well
and I wasn't even trying.

01:26.018 --> 01:29.727
- Have you told the father?
- I called him at nine this morning,

01:30.063 --> 01:32.736
which was seven o'clock at night
Cairo time.

01:35.027 --> 01:39.578
Is that pertinent or are you dazzling me
with your command of time zones?

01:39.948 --> 01:42.826
He's gone to Cairo. He's an architect.

01:43.118 --> 01:45.632
Wow. Really?

01:45.913 --> 01:48.950
- When's he coming back?
- He isn't.

01:49.249 --> 01:53.401
That's fine with me. I'm comfortable
raising this child by myself.

01:54.630 --> 01:58.509
And I'm sure everybody around here
will give you plenty of support.

01:58.842 --> 02:01.993
Roz, who's the proud papa?
You got it narrowed down yet?

02:03.430 --> 02:05.466
That's nice. Very nice.

02:06.058 --> 02:08.491
- Frasier, would you excuse us?
- Of course.

02:08.769 --> 02:13.081
Just remember the baby's future, Roz.
Try to make it look like an accident.

02:14.274 --> 02:17.744
I was just kidding.
I'm sure you know who the dad is.

02:18.070 --> 02:20.823
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

02:21.115 --> 02:24.312
Do you remember Janet's party
a couple of months ago?

02:24.618 --> 02:27.496
You got really drunk
and I drove you home.

02:31.667 --> 02:33.259
Yeah. What about it?

02:33.502 --> 02:36.255
You invited me up,
and I'd had a few myself

02:36.547 --> 02:39.698
- and the next thing I knew...
- No, I don't believe this.

02:40.008 --> 02:43.637
I don't even remember us...
Just tell me you're joking.

02:43.971 --> 02:46.804
We don't have to get married
right away.

02:48.725 --> 02:52.764
I thought you'd be happy about this.
I mean, we were wonderful together.

02:53.105 --> 02:56.302
When you made love to me,
you were so tender and caring...

02:58.861 --> 03:01.136
Tender and caring? No way was that me.

03:02.406 --> 03:05.239
You almost had me. Good one, Roz.

03:09.163 --> 03:11.154
- Someone at the door.
- Really?

03:11.415 --> 03:14.009
So that's what that chiming sound means.

03:14.960 --> 03:16.951
I'm indisposed. Would you mind?

03:17.212 --> 03:19.601
Sure. Sorry, Daph.
Hang on, she's coming.

03:21.258 --> 03:25.297
You take it easy. Rest up
for that big trek to the dinner table.

03:27.764 --> 03:29.197
Hello, Dr Crane.

03:29.433 --> 03:32.789
Daphne, before I come in,
I have to say I am mortified

03:33.103 --> 03:36.459
about my behaviour last night.
I don't know what got into me.

03:36.774 --> 03:39.493
About a quart of vodka, for starters.

03:40.652 --> 03:42.961
There's no need for an apology.

03:43.238 --> 03:45.911
I thought what you did
was very chivalrous.

03:46.200 --> 03:49.272
I believe if a woman
finds herself in such a predicament,

03:49.578 --> 03:52.536
a man of honour has an obligation
to do the right thing.

03:52.831 --> 03:56.983
- And poor Roz is in that predicament.
- Do I smell chicken?

03:58.754 --> 04:01.905
We'll be serving dinner
as soon as Roz gets here.

04:02.216 --> 04:04.207
I didn't think she should be alone.

04:04.468 --> 04:05.947
How's she doing?

04:06.178 --> 04:10.968
OK, considering
she's decided to have the child herself.

04:11.350 --> 04:13.341
Things have changed since my day.

04:13.602 --> 04:16.560
Back then, if a girl got in trouble,
her family'd ship her off

04:16.855 --> 04:21.087
to relatives and if anybody asked,
just lied and said she went to Europe.

04:21.442 --> 04:25.152
Then when she came back, they'd
raise the baby as a little sister.

04:25.489 --> 04:29.164
Not like today.
We had morals and values back then.

04:33.205 --> 04:36.993
I assumed I'd have children,
but if Maris and I don't reconcile soon,

04:37.334 --> 04:39.689
the issue will be moot.
She's older than I am.

04:39.962 --> 04:42.271
and her biological clock
is winding down.

04:42.548 --> 04:45.699
Luckily she flies to ZÃ¼rich
twice a year to have it reset.

04:50.764 --> 04:54.200
Babies are wonderful, but Roz
does have a rough road ahead of her.

04:54.518 --> 04:57.510
It can never be easy
balancing a career with motherhood.

04:57.813 --> 05:02.329
Where will she find a husband?
A kid needs a mother and a father.

05:02.693 --> 05:06.606
That's Roz. Now remember she came here
to have a relaxing dinner,

05:06.947 --> 05:09.939
not to be reminded of
the situation that she's in.

05:10.242 --> 05:14.360
If she doesn't bring it up,
we won't discuss it. Agreed?

05:14.705 --> 05:16.218
All right.

05:16.457 --> 05:18.687
Daphne, you may answer the door.

05:21.628 --> 05:23.584
Well, thank you.

05:24.590 --> 05:27.946
Why don't I get a feather duster
and a French maid's uniform?

05:28.260 --> 05:32.378
That would teach them, wouldn't it,
Daphne, and I would pick it out for you.

05:34.850 --> 05:36.841
- Hello, Roz.
- Hey, Daphne.

05:37.770 --> 05:41.160
Dinner's almost ready.
You just make yourself comfortable.

05:51.283 --> 05:54.753
- That's such a cute skirt.
- Thanks. I just got it.

06:00.417 --> 06:03.136
I just got these pants.

06:06.089 --> 06:08.080
They're nice.

06:12.721 --> 06:14.996
I got some interesting news last night.

06:15.265 --> 06:19.099
Well, I and a large portion of Seattle
found out I was pregnant.

06:20.354 --> 06:22.345
Don't you want to ask me about it?

06:22.606 --> 06:25.245
Yes, of course we do,
but we were told not to.

06:25.526 --> 06:28.802
Frasier's afraid we might
make you uncomfortable.

06:29.113 --> 06:31.911
I want to talk about it.
I'm really excited.

06:32.199 --> 06:34.394
I'm going to be a mom.
I've got a lot to do.

06:34.660 --> 06:38.369
- One thing I've got to get pronto...
- A husband.

06:40.165 --> 06:42.963
I was going to say a bigger apartment.

06:44.253 --> 06:46.244
Maybe the husband'll have one.

06:47.965 --> 06:50.525
How did the father take it
when you told him?

06:52.094 --> 06:55.370
- Don't worry, she brought it up.
- He took it very well.

06:55.681 --> 06:58.514
He won't be that involved.
He moved to Cairo.

06:58.809 --> 07:02.404
Where would he have moved to
if he had taken it badly?

07:04.231 --> 07:08.110
No, he's working in Cairo on a project.
He's an archaeologist.

07:08.444 --> 07:11.481
Roz, why don't we get you
something to drink?

07:11.780 --> 07:15.409
- Do you have any mineral water?
- Eight kinds. Come and pick one.

07:15.742 --> 07:18.176
He's got room for
all that water in that fridge,

07:18.454 --> 07:22.891
and I have to keep
my can of spray cheese under the sink.

07:23.250 --> 07:28.085
This morning you told me
the father was an architect.

07:28.464 --> 07:31.103
I did? That was a slip of the tongue.

07:33.343 --> 07:36.016
- How did you two meet again?
- In a bar.

07:36.305 --> 07:40.662
- You told me it was on a double date.
- Yes, it was on a double date.

07:41.018 --> 07:43.009
You told me nothing.

07:45.522 --> 07:48.355
What is going on, Roz?
You're hiding something.

07:48.650 --> 07:51.722
Niles, please, would you excuse us?

07:52.029 --> 07:55.226
By all means. I just came in
to open a bottle of wine. Sorry.

07:57.284 --> 07:59.639
Is it that you
don't know who the father is?

07:59.912 --> 08:01.903
Of course I know.

08:02.164 --> 08:06.715
- Why don't you tell me?
- Because I haven't even told him yet.

08:08.545 --> 08:11.696
I'm not sure I'm going to tell him.
It's complicated.

08:12.007 --> 08:16.159
I don't care who he is but he has
a right to know he's having a child.

08:16.512 --> 08:21.427
- This isn't any of your business.
- It's certainly his business.

08:21.809 --> 08:25.245
You have an obligation to let him know
you're having his baby.

08:25.562 --> 08:29.237
Niles, do you mind? It's impossible
to have a private conversation

08:29.566 --> 08:31.557
with you eavesdropping.

08:31.819 --> 08:35.049
I resent the implication
that I have nothing better to do

08:35.364 --> 08:39.118
than spy on you like a nosy teenager.
I came in for a corkscrew.

08:39.451 --> 08:41.442
I'm sorry.

08:44.331 --> 08:46.925
All I could get
was she hasn't told the father.

08:50.879 --> 08:53.439
- Double latte, please.
- I'll bring it over.

08:53.715 --> 08:55.706
Thank you.

08:56.218 --> 08:59.847
- Morning, Roz.
- Frasier? What are you doing here?

09:00.180 --> 09:02.648
It must be a shock
to find me here in this place

09:02.933 --> 09:05.163
that I come to every day of my life.

09:05.436 --> 09:09.111
- You had a dental appointment.
- I rescheduled it.

09:09.440 --> 09:12.671
- Thanks for telling me.
- What's going on?

09:12.985 --> 09:16.375
- I came here to talk to him.
- The father?

09:16.697 --> 09:19.370
- I'm proud of you.
- Now get out of here.

09:19.658 --> 09:22.775
- May I have that to go, please?
- Sure, Dr Crane.

09:23.078 --> 09:25.194
- Roz, how are you doing?
- Good. You?

09:25.456 --> 09:29.335
- Great. What can I get you?
- I'll have a decaf, thanks.

09:29.668 --> 09:31.260
Thank you.

09:31.503 --> 09:33.300
- He's a nice kid.
- Yes.

09:33.547 --> 09:36.015
- Working to put himself through school.
- Yes.

09:36.300 --> 09:38.689
- He's the father, isn't he?
- Yes.

09:48.687 --> 09:50.996
The father of your child is a teenager?

09:51.273 --> 09:55.869
He's not a teenager, anymore.
He had a birthday three weeks ago.

09:56.737 --> 09:59.968
We just went out for a couple of weeks,
and then it was over.

10:00.282 --> 10:02.955
It's embarrassing, though,

10:03.243 --> 10:07.714
him being seven years younger than I am.
Put your eyebrows down.

10:09.124 --> 10:12.480
I've seen your driver's licence,
and you don't weigh no 170.

10:15.339 --> 10:18.934
Now you know what I'm talking about.
I don't want to ruin his life.

10:19.259 --> 10:22.456
- He still has a right to know.
- I know that.

10:23.138 --> 10:27.370
It won't be easy. When you
were in college, if a woman told you

10:27.726 --> 10:31.480
she was carrying your child,
wouldn't you have been devastated?

10:31.814 --> 10:34.487
In my case, I would've been mystified.

10:35.651 --> 10:39.439
- How do I even begin to tell him?
- It's never easy.

10:39.780 --> 10:41.896
So, Roz, what made you switch to decaf?

10:42.157 --> 10:45.866
Then sometimes a natural opening
does present itself.

10:46.203 --> 10:50.401
Trying to stay healthy. I called this
morning and your number wasn't working.

10:50.749 --> 10:52.023
I'm not in the dorms.

10:52.251 --> 10:56.961
- Did you get your own place?
- No, I moved back in with my parents.

10:57.339 --> 11:02.049
- Frasier, your dad's waving to you.
- Right. Like my dad's waving to me.

11:03.053 --> 11:05.772
My dad's over there waving to me.
Excuse me.

11:07.683 --> 11:10.072
You look incredible.

11:10.352 --> 11:12.070
- I do?
- Yeah.

11:12.312 --> 11:14.303
Dad, what brings you here?

11:14.565 --> 11:19.480
Sherry took her sister across the street
to buy some foundation garments.

11:19.862 --> 11:23.411
- I think they call them bras now.
- Not these you don't.

11:24.867 --> 11:28.382
You could cross the River Kwai
on one of those babies.

11:29.872 --> 11:33.342
- I have something to tell you.
- I've got some news, too.

11:33.667 --> 11:36.500
Remember that junior year
abroad programme?

11:36.795 --> 11:41.346
I'm in. I am leaving next week and
spending the rest of the year in Paris.

11:41.717 --> 11:43.673
Congratulations. I'm happy for you.

11:43.927 --> 11:46.885
Thanks. First my soccer team
wins the championship,

11:47.181 --> 11:49.854
then I ace my finals,
and now I'm going to Paris.

11:50.142 --> 11:52.133
I'm starting to think, what's next?

11:54.563 --> 11:56.872
Funny you should ask.

11:57.149 --> 12:00.061
- There's something in my eye.
- I don't see anything.

12:00.360 --> 12:02.476
- Are you sure?
- I don't see anything.

12:02.738 --> 12:04.808
- You're not looking.
- All right.

12:05.073 --> 12:06.791
No, don't touch!

12:08.911 --> 12:10.947
Look, Dad, I've got to go talk to Roz.

12:11.205 --> 12:14.083
Go to the men's room
and rinse it with cold water.

12:14.374 --> 12:18.890
I'm glad I worked all those extra shifts
to put you through medical school.

12:24.176 --> 12:26.167
- Roz?
- Don't worry, I told him.

12:26.428 --> 12:30.307
- How did he take it?
- He was pretty freaked out.

12:30.641 --> 12:32.871
I said I didn't need anything from him,

12:33.143 --> 12:35.611
and I was going
to raise this baby by myself.

12:35.896 --> 12:40.606
Anyway, he's going to be fine.
I'm late for a doctor's appointment.

12:40.984 --> 12:43.134
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I guess so.

12:43.403 --> 12:45.359
Can I take you to dinner tonight?

12:45.614 --> 12:47.923
Thank you, that would be nice.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.191
I'll see you later.

12:51.912 --> 12:55.905
I can't stand these yuppie joints.
Some bozo went through the bathroom

12:56.250 --> 12:58.844
correcting all the grammar
in the graffiti.

12:59.128 --> 13:01.596
Who can have
that much time on his hands?

13:01.880 --> 13:03.199
Unbelievable.

13:03.423 --> 13:06.142
- It was Niles, wasn't it?
- I'll talk to him again.

13:10.222 --> 13:12.019
It's open, Frasier.

13:14.017 --> 13:16.850
I'm sorry.
I probably should have called first.

13:17.146 --> 13:20.104
No, that's all right.
I'm just surprised to see you.

13:20.399 --> 13:22.629
I'm surprised to be here myself.

13:25.988 --> 13:27.979
- Come in.
- Thanks.

13:30.868 --> 13:32.859
These are for you.

13:33.287 --> 13:37.405
There was a card, but it kind of
blew off on my way over. I rode my bike.

13:39.334 --> 13:41.325
- I acted like an idiot.
- It's OK.

13:41.587 --> 13:46.024
No, it's not. I mean, when you told me,
all I could think about was myself

13:46.383 --> 13:50.058
and how it was going to affect me.
But once I calmed down,

13:51.722 --> 13:53.713
I started thinking about you

13:53.974 --> 13:55.407
and the...

13:55.642 --> 13:57.155
Baby.

13:57.394 --> 13:59.589
So, that's the other reason I'm here.

14:01.190 --> 14:03.750
I'm not going to Paris.
I'm quitting school.

14:04.026 --> 14:06.381
I'm going to work
at the cafe full time.

14:07.446 --> 14:10.244
So you've come to tell me
you've lost your mind.

14:10.532 --> 14:13.524
No, I came here to ask you to marry me.

14:14.870 --> 14:16.667
Oh, Rick...

14:16.914 --> 14:19.508
That's so wrong.

14:21.043 --> 14:23.034
Yeah, that's right.

14:23.295 --> 14:25.286
Roz, will you marry me?

14:25.547 --> 14:29.222
No, the proposal was fine.
It was absolutely lovely.

14:29.551 --> 14:32.987
- It's just that we can't...
- No, please. Don't say no yet.

14:33.305 --> 14:36.502
I have been thinking about this
all afternoon.

14:39.144 --> 14:41.135
And I could fall in love with you.

14:42.773 --> 14:45.446
I could be a good husband,
a good father.

14:46.902 --> 14:51.180
Rick, that's the whole point
of being 20. You could be anything.

14:52.407 --> 14:56.366
I'm much older than you are.
I am things.

14:56.703 --> 14:59.934
I know what you're saying,
but I'm not too young for this.

15:00.249 --> 15:02.638
My mom was only 17 when she had me.

15:02.918 --> 15:06.149
Your mother's only 37 years old?

15:12.428 --> 15:15.943
And would you two hit it off.
I mean, you guys have a lot in common.

15:17.182 --> 15:20.492
- Actually, you sort of even look alike.
- Stop right there.

15:21.395 --> 15:22.874
Listen,

15:23.105 --> 15:25.380
your proposal was

15:25.649 --> 15:27.719
so sweet.

15:27.985 --> 15:30.499
- It's my first one, actually.
- Mine, too.

15:31.989 --> 15:33.741
You're so...

15:33.991 --> 15:37.381
I hope that you can understand
why I can't possibly marry you.

15:38.537 --> 15:41.495
When I get married,
it's going to be to someone I love,

15:41.790 --> 15:44.179
and someone who loves me,

15:44.460 --> 15:47.691
and someone who can legally
drink champagne at my wedding.

15:50.382 --> 15:53.340
OK. I understand.

15:55.262 --> 15:57.617
- So is...?
- This is the sonogram picture.

15:57.890 --> 15:59.960
I got it this morning. Right there.

16:00.225 --> 16:02.944
Wow, that dot's my kid.

16:03.228 --> 16:05.742
No, that dot's just a dot.
That dot's your kid.

16:07.024 --> 16:10.334
- You can have it if you want.
- Thank you.

16:10.652 --> 16:14.884
I can send you photos, updates,
that sort of thing, if you like.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.879
I would like that. Yeah, very much.

16:20.412 --> 16:22.607
- Roz, are you sure...?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

16:23.457 --> 16:26.529
I think this is the right thing,
for you and for me.

16:28.712 --> 16:30.065
Now, go.

16:30.297 --> 16:35.576
Go to Paris. Go learn. Go have fun.
Just don't come back wearing a beret.

16:52.194 --> 16:54.185
- Take care of yourself.
- You, too.

17:10.420 --> 17:13.617
- I said go.
- But I just got here.

17:17.301 --> 17:19.292
I'm sorry, Frasier. Come in.

17:26.270 --> 17:28.306
I ran into Rick in the hall.

17:28.564 --> 17:30.998
He asked me to marry him.

17:32.234 --> 17:35.544
- I said no.
- That was very sweet of him.

17:35.863 --> 17:40.459
- I was making tea. You want some?
- Yeah, thanks. With milk, please.

17:43.370 --> 17:46.089
Well, you've had quite a day,
haven't you?

17:46.373 --> 17:48.523
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

17:50.085 --> 17:52.076
It's OK to not be fine.

17:52.337 --> 17:55.170
- Is it OK just to be OK?
- Yeah, sure.

17:56.842 --> 17:58.833
Thanks, Roz.

17:59.553 --> 18:01.703
This milk's expired.

18:01.972 --> 18:03.530
Whoa. It has.

18:03.766 --> 18:06.360
That's all right,
I can drink the tea straight.

18:07.478 --> 18:09.912
I had no idea I let this milk expire.

18:10.355 --> 18:12.346
It's really all right, Roz.

18:13.650 --> 18:15.925
I can't take this.

18:16.195 --> 18:18.834
How did I let this happen?

18:19.114 --> 18:22.743
Are we still talking about the milk?

18:23.076 --> 18:26.307
Don't you see? Milk is a staple.

18:26.622 --> 18:30.615
I let a staple go bad.
Good mothers don't let staples go bad.

18:30.959 --> 18:33.075
How can I be responsible for a child

18:33.337 --> 18:38.092
when I can't even keep fresh milk
in the house? Kids need milk.

18:38.842 --> 18:42.232
Roz, kids don't even drink milk
for the first year.

18:42.554 --> 18:44.545
See? I didn't even know that.

18:46.308 --> 18:48.822
I didn't know that either
until I was a parent.

18:49.520 --> 18:52.990
Don't you understand?
I have to know everything.

18:53.315 --> 18:56.113
You could know half of everything,
about the milk.

18:56.401 --> 19:00.713
- Lilith could know about the booties.
- You never met Lilith, did you?

19:05.702 --> 19:09.775
Just forget the milk
and forget the tea and talk to me.

19:10.124 --> 19:14.561
I don't know where to start. Everything
in my life is about to change.

19:14.920 --> 19:17.639
My body, my love life...

19:17.923 --> 19:22.474
Yes, but it's also going to change
in fantastic ways.

19:23.679 --> 19:27.513
I remember the first night I brought
Frederick home from the hospital.

19:27.850 --> 19:31.047
You put this tiny thing
into a tiny little bed,

19:33.856 --> 19:38.213
and you look around and you realise
that the entire house has changed.

19:40.779 --> 19:43.657
I know. I want that.

19:43.949 --> 19:46.065
But, God, the responsibility.

19:46.326 --> 19:49.284
Well, yes, but it's all worth it.

19:51.707 --> 19:55.017
You get to share your life
with a remarkable little creature

19:56.920 --> 19:59.150
who only lives in the present,

19:59.423 --> 20:02.415
runs around naked
without the slightest bit of shame.

20:03.761 --> 20:07.390
Can entertain himself
just staring at a shiny object.

20:07.723 --> 20:11.716
- Isn't that wonderful?
- Isn't that Bulldog?

20:14.480 --> 20:16.755
Well, technically, yes.

20:18.108 --> 20:23.501
Roz, I'm going to tell you something l
didn't find out until I became a father.

20:23.906 --> 20:27.455
You don't just love your children.

20:29.953 --> 20:31.944
You fall in love with them.

20:33.749 --> 20:38.459
It's that same rush, that same
overwhelming desire to see them,

20:38.837 --> 20:43.831
to hold them, bore other people to tears
with every detail about them.

20:45.385 --> 20:47.376
Oh, my God.

20:48.639 --> 20:50.630
I'm going to have a baby.

20:52.851 --> 20:56.161
Someone who's going to call out
for mom and it's gonna be me.

20:58.607 --> 21:03.397
I'm really scared.
What if I can't do this by myself?

21:03.779 --> 21:07.454
But, Roz, you're not all by yourself.

21:08.700 --> 21:11.851
- I'm here.
- Thank you, Frasier.

21:12.579 --> 21:15.218
I'll be available
in whatever way you wish.

21:15.499 --> 21:19.458
From taking you out to dinner tonight
to that moment in the delivery room

21:19.795 --> 21:24.471
when you say welcome to the world,
little Jimmy or little Sally or...

21:25.509 --> 21:27.704
dare I hope, little Frasier.

21:27.970 --> 21:31.280
- I think I'm going to be sick.
- I got carried away.

21:31.598 --> 21:35.227
- No, I mean I'm going to hurl.
- Oh, dear God. I'll wait here.
