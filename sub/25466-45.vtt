09:41.450 --> 09:43.278
You know, after all this,

09:43.321 --> 09:46.324
I don't think I can think
of you guys as superheroes
again.

09:46.368 --> 09:47.587
[all] What?

09:47.630 --> 09:49.240
What I do think is that

09:49.284 --> 09:51.460
you guys don't have to pay
top dollar for a new mattress.

09:51.503 --> 09:52.940
[all] Um...

09:54.289 --> 09:56.726
Turns out Robin
had a serious concussion

09:56.770 --> 09:58.598
and ended up
in the hospital.

09:58.641 --> 10:00.077
But what he meant to say was

10:00.121 --> 10:02.819
that he thought of all of us
as a family.

10:02.863 --> 10:04.604
And that's how
we thought of ourselves

10:04.647 --> 10:06.083
from that moment
forward.

10:06.127 --> 10:08.738
That's the story of
the greatest disaster

10:08.782 --> 10:10.435
the world has ever known.

10:10.479 --> 10:12.786
-[button beeps]
-Thank you,
for the story, grandma.

10:12.829 --> 10:15.789
Yes, I found it soothing.

10:15.832 --> 10:17.355
Goodnight, sweeties.

10:19.314 --> 10:22.926
[all] Hey, y'all!
Hey, Bumblebee. Hey, Bumblebee.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.841
Bumblebee. Bumblebee.
