-Why are you coming down on me?
-I'm not.

12:18.154 --> 12:22.283
Yes, you are! You're, like,
being all negative about my dreams.

12:22.366 --> 12:24.243
You're just like my dad,
except you smell great!

12:24.326 --> 12:29.248
-It's because I care about you.
-Well, Vic hasn't changed me one bit.

12:29.331 --> 12:35.045
And mark my words, Kevin Murphy's gonna
be famous, or my name isn't Maui Mike.

12:35.546 --> 12:38.966
Oh, yeah, Vic told me
my new stage name is Maui Mike.

12:39.049 --> 12:42.178
Well, Mike, if you see Kevin,

12:42.261 --> 12:46.140
tell him I miss him and his music.

12:50.811 --> 12:52.146
[Samantha] That's all for today.

12:52.688 --> 12:55.524
Excellent work, everyone, especially Sue,

12:55.608 --> 12:57.985
who very bravely self-leuraged.

12:58.527 --> 12:59.862
Good job, Sue.

13:00.988 --> 13:02.656
Sue, what's wrong?

13:02.740 --> 13:06.035
You were doing a lot of cursing
during the serenity exercise.

13:06.118 --> 13:06.952
I'm fine.

13:08.537 --> 13:11.415
[whimpers] Frank's being such a jerk.

13:11.499 --> 13:14.502
He left on a work trip
and hasn't called once.

13:14.585 --> 13:17.046
And it's up to him to call
because he's in the wrong.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.632
Aw, Sue. I'm glad you've learned

13:19.715 --> 13:22.718
the most valuable lesson
a woman can learn:

13:22.802 --> 13:25.012
we do not need men.

13:25.095 --> 13:27.723
Well, I guess it feels that way sometimes.

13:27.807 --> 13:29.683
No, Sue. We don't need them.

13:29.767 --> 13:33.395
-Men are a biological design flaw.
-Oh.

13:33.479 --> 13:37.441
And when new technologies
provide us with synthetic semen

13:37.525 --> 13:40.110
and robots to open fussy pickle jars,

13:40.194 --> 13:42.321
what will men have to offer us?

13:42.738 --> 13:45.574
Nothing. They will be obsolete.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.826
Obsolete?

13:47.409 --> 13:50.371
Wait, no.
No, Frank and I are just in a fight.

13:50.454 --> 13:51.497
You're in a war!

13:51.580 --> 13:54.708
Jesus Christ! I just want Frank to call.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.794
He's my husband. I love him.

13:58.838 --> 14:01.507
Sue, you sound insane right now!

"And that is why it is important
that you always wear a lead apron

14:07.596 --> 14:10.266

when dealing with X-rays."

14:10.349 --> 14:12.101
Jesus Christ, is that true?

14:12.184 --> 14:16.272
I see now that, in future sessions,
that should be in the first chapter.

14:18.065 --> 14:18.899

14:20.234 --> 14:22.862
Okay, we got to do better
on this final test tomorrow morning

14:22.945 --> 14:25.239

14:25.322 --> 14:27.575
The one guy kept showing
everybody his goiter.

Frank, I'll catch up with you in a minute.

14:32.496 --> 14:35.291
-We got to study for that test!
-Yeah, yeah, I know all that shit!

Guns are bad. Ball aprons are good.

that certification, the airline's fucked.

but not on an empty stomach.

-I get where you're at.

so much poon you'll get sick of it

that this stuff doesn't feel like me.

Because I'll cut your fucking throat.

This is show business, you little cunt.
No one gives a shit how you feel.

15:39.939 --> 15:43.734
This is my last shot,
and I won't let you fuck it up.

15:43.817 --> 15:45.569
You're gonna go out there,

one section at a time?

and let me order some brain food?

You mean like the police?

No, I'm saying, do you feel
like your elected representative

16:45.421 --> 16:47.172

Not now, Frank. I'm on
a fact-finding mission for my district.

23:32.327 --> 23:34.496
-It's only a movie, Mom.
-[gasps] Kevin!

23:35.997 --> 23:36.998
It's late.

23:37.082 --> 23:38.625
[sighs] I can't sleep either.

23:40.043 --> 23:42.254
Were you at a costume party?

23:42.337 --> 23:44.881
Kind of. Why were you crying?

23:44.965 --> 23:47.509
Your father and I saw this movie
when we were dating.

23:47.592 --> 23:50.345
<i>I'll love you forever, Dusty Wagonwheel.</i>

23:50.429 --> 23:51.847
Long ago.

23:51.930 --> 23:53.515
Ah, feeling old, huh? [exhales]

23:53.598 --> 23:55.434
Yeah, it's pretty scary. I get it.

23:55.976 --> 23:58.562
Um... I don't think Alice
wants to see me anymore.

23:58.645 --> 24:02.315
Oh, honey, I hope that's not the case.
What did she say?

24:02.399 --> 24:06.319
Well... she didn't say anything.
She just walked away.

24:07.028 --> 24:08.697
She hung up on me in person.

24:08.780 --> 24:11.992
Well, you can't leave it like that
without talking to her.

24:12.075 --> 24:15.871
When you care about somebody, you need
to make an effort to work things out.

24:15.954 --> 24:19.416
Yeah, you're right. That's good advice.

24:19.499 --> 24:20.834
Yeah, I guess it is.

24:21.877 --> 24:24.880
So where's Dad in all this?

24:24.963 --> 24:27.716
That is a very good question.

24:27.799 --> 24:31.052
No, I mean, really, where is he? I've been
at Vic's house for the last four days.

24:34.222 --> 24:35.474
[snoring]

24:36.308 --> 24:37.893
[Ed] Frank. Frank.

24:37.976 --> 24:39.019
Alaquippa Ed?

24:39.102 --> 24:42.314
It's me, Ed, from Alaquippa.
I'm the ground chief--

24:42.397 --> 24:47.486
I know who you are. I literally just said
your fucking name. You're up late.

24:47.569 --> 24:49.738
Actually early. It's 7:30.

24:49.821 --> 24:51.406
Ah, shit.

24:51.490 --> 24:54.576
Time for my grapefruit juice.
It helps the blood clot better.

24:54.659 --> 24:56.703
Ed, no offense, but could you fuck off?

24:56.786 --> 24:59.498
Okay, I mean, Christ,
my whole family hates me.

24:59.581 --> 25:00.999
I have a fourth kid on the way.

25:01.082 --> 25:03.335
You want to take a bet how long it takes
that little guy to turn on me?

25:03.418 --> 25:08.215
Gee, Frank, with all that going on,
I'm surprised you even came to Cleveland.

25:08.798 --> 25:12.636
It's refreshing to see a man show
so much enthusiasm for his employer.

25:12.719 --> 25:15.222
-Damn right.
-Especially one on her dying days.

25:15.305 --> 25:17.516
Dying days?
The hell are you talking about?

25:17.599 --> 25:22.145
You know. Mrs. Dunbarton is going
to sell Mohican to Alaquippa.

25:22.729 --> 25:25.941
-She what?
-Oh, my goodness, you didn't know?

25:26.525 --> 25:31.530
Well, sometimes my mouth
moves faster than my...

25:32.864 --> 25:33.698
brain.

25:35.575 --> 25:36.868
That son of a bitch.

25:38.286 --> 25:39.412
You fucking son of a bitch!

25:39.496 --> 25:42.040
They said they'd fix the toilet
this morning!

25:42.123 --> 25:44.125
I don't know what you want me to do!

25:44.209 --> 25:47.587
She's selling Mohican to Alaquippa?
Did you know about this?

25:47.671 --> 25:49.381
Oh, you found out.

25:49.464 --> 25:51.299
Oh, I'm so relieved.

25:51.383 --> 25:56.346
Burdened with this terrible secret,
I've been guilt-eating this whole trip.

25:56.429 --> 26:00.016
Now I don't have to.
I deserve an honesty squirt.

26:00.934 --> 26:04.646
Tell me. Tell me right now.
Am I gonna have a job after the sale?

26:04.729 --> 26:09.276
There may be a few redundancies,
so we really don't know yet.

26:09.359 --> 26:11.403
What about Rosie, Red, Carl?

26:11.486 --> 26:15.198
The weird grounds crew guy
and the other weird grounds crew guy?

26:15.282 --> 26:16.533
Are they redundant?

26:16.616 --> 26:18.660
Jesus Christ, I dedicate myself
to this airline,

26:18.743 --> 26:20.495
you can't even guarantee my job?

26:20.996 --> 26:24.165
You know what? Take
your fucking X-ray test yourself, Bob!

26:24.249 --> 26:27.127
Just give me a second to explain. [gasps]

26:27.210 --> 26:28.837
In ten or 15 minutes.

26:29.671 --> 26:31.214
-Oh!
-[flatulence]

26:31.298 --> 26:33.883
I think I just passed a pearl!

26:34.342 --> 26:38.555
Goddamn flapping-skin fucking asshole.
Nobody cares about me.

26:39.139 --> 26:41.516
You give and you give and you give.
This is what I get back?

26:41.600 --> 26:44.519
You know something? Fuck you all.
I'm doing something for Frank Murphy.

26:45.520 --> 26:48.523
What the fuck are you looking at?
How do I get to this Bowling Ball Museum?

26:48.607 --> 26:51.109
The number 14 bus stop's right outside.

26:51.192 --> 26:52.027
Thanks.

26:53.778 --> 26:57.282
I'm sorry, ma'am, none of the four men
in the honeymoon suite

26:57.365 --> 27:00.035
are answering the phone.
May I take a message?

27:00.118 --> 27:02.787
Can you tell him his wife called?

27:02.871 --> 27:07.292
And, um, tell him I don't like
how we ended things last night.

27:07.375 --> 27:08.335
I'm angry, but...

27:08.418 --> 27:12.922
"Still love him. Want to talk this out."

27:14.049 --> 27:15.091
Mm-hmm.

27:15.175 --> 27:16.009
Uh-huh.

27:16.718 --> 27:22.182
"Oh, God. You think
your water just broke."

27:23.266 --> 27:26.561
<i>Uh-huh. How do you spell "mucus plug"?</i>

27:27.103 --> 27:31.191
<i>M-U-C-U...</i>

27:31.274 --> 27:33.193
<i>Hmm. No "K," huh?</i>

27:33.276 --> 27:39.574
<i>Hmm. "Please stop interrupting me</i>
<i>and just give him the goddamn message.</i>

27:40.158 --> 27:44.120
<i>I am going to hang up now</i>
<i>so I can go give birth."</i>

27:45.580 --> 27:50.001
<i>I can't spell that,</i>
<i>so I'll just write, "Bloodcurdling scream.</i>

27:50.085 --> 27:52.212
<i>Water sounds on--"</i>

27:52.295 --> 27:53.296
[whirring]

27:53.380 --> 27:54.756
[gunshot]
