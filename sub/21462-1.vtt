<i>My name is Chuck Wepner.</i>

01:09.240 --> 01:10.469
<i>You don't know me.</i>

01:10.560 --> 01:13.759
<i>Well, you do know me,</i>
<i>but you don't know you know me.</i>

01:13.840 --> 01:16.999
<i>Once upon a time, I was</i>
<i>the heavyweight champ of New Jersey.</i>

01:17.080 --> 01:19.039
<i>They called me the Bayonne Bleeder.</i>

01:19.120 --> 01:21.849
<i>I always hated that name,</i>
<i>but for some reason, it stuck.</i>

01:22.240 --> 01:25.790
<i>Hoboken had Sinatra, Bayonne had me.</i>

01:26.600 --> 01:28.478
Chuck fuckin' Wepner!

01:28.560 --> 01:31.234
I swear, this might be
the proudest day in my entire life.

01:31.360 --> 01:33.591
It's like Christmas and All Saints' Day
rolled into one.

01:33.680 --> 01:35.876
John, you know who this guy is?

01:35.960 --> 01:37.360
Yeah, I know who Arty is.

01:37.440 --> 01:40.000
Did you know Arty invented
the wet T-shirt contest?

01:40.120 --> 01:41.952
- What?
- I shit you not.

01:42.080 --> 01:43.912
No, Arty Stock, no wet nip. Period.

01:44.040 --> 01:45.110
That was you?

01:45.200 --> 01:46.395
Hey, I was just trying to sell some booze

01:46.480 --> 01:47.960
without getting shut down,
if you know what I mean.

01:48.040 --> 01:49.599
That's genius right there,
that's what that is.

01:49.680 --> 01:51.353
Hey, no, Champ. You...

01:51.440 --> 01:53.352
- What?
- You're a legend.

01:53.440 --> 01:54.590
To legends.

01:55.040 --> 01:58.192
<i>I made a name for myself</i>
<i>by doing a lot of crazy shit.</i>

01:58.280 --> 02:00.317
<i>Not all of it's true, but this part is.</i>

02:00.400 --> 02:04.280
<i>In this corner, the former</i>
<i>New Jersey heavyweight champion,</i>

02:04.360 --> 02:07.910
<i>the man who went 15 rounds</i>
<i>with Muhammad Ali, okay?</i>

02:08.000 --> 02:10.560
<i>The pride of Bayonne, Chuck Wepner!</i>

02:16.120 --> 02:17.634
<i>And in this corner,</i>

02:17.720 --> 02:20.554
<i>you know him from his</i>
<i>Hollywood movie,</i> Paint Your Wagon,

02:20.640 --> 02:22.597
<i>his many</i> Tonight Show <i>appearances,</i>

02:22.680 --> 02:26.469
<i>he's undefeated in 1,303 bouts.</i>

02:26.560 --> 02:27.710
<i>It's Victor!</i>

02:29.400 --> 02:31.756
- All right, nothing to the face, okay?
- Did you tell him that?

02:31.880 --> 02:32.916
No face.

02:38.600 --> 02:39.670
Let's go!

02:41.080 --> 02:43.436
<i>For me, it was always about</i>
<i>putting on a show.</i>

02:43.520 --> 02:46.433
<i>Even when I was a kid, growing up in Bayonne,</i>

02:46.560 --> 02:49.120
<i>me and my brother Don</i>
<i>were a couple of real clowns.</i>

02:49.200 --> 02:52.477
<i>I was not really a fighter,</i>
<i>but this was Bayonne.</i>

02:52.560 --> 02:54.995
<i>One way or another,</i>
<i>you were gonna end up fighting.</i>

02:57.320 --> 03:01.030
<i>In 1954, Malphy Esposito stole my basketball.</i>

03:02.600 --> 03:05.991
<i>I didn't wanna do anything,</i>
<i>but he whacked me pretty good.</i>

03:06.120 --> 03:09.033
<i>I may not be the greatest fighter</i>
<i>of all time, but what I learned that day...</i>

03:09.120 --> 03:10.190
Chuck.

03:10.280 --> 03:12.112
<i>...is that I had a gift. I was special.</i>

03:12.960 --> 03:14.360
<i>When you stop any guy in the street</i>

03:14.440 --> 03:17.911
<i>and you ask him</i>
<i>who Chuck Wepner was, he'll tell ya,</i>

03:18.000 --> 03:19.832
<i>"That guy could take a punch."</i>

03:47.160 --> 03:49.834
<i>For a guy who wasn't really a fighter,</i>
<i>I was doing pretty good.</i>

03:50.720 --> 03:53.918
<i>By 1974, I was flying up</i>
<i>the heavyweight ranks</i>

03:54.000 --> 03:56.674
<i>and primed for a shot at the title</i>
<i>against "Big George" Foreman.</i>

03:57.480 --> 04:00.917
<i>The only guy who stood in my way</i>
<i>was Terry Hinke, the Stormin' Mormon.</i>

04:01.000 --> 04:02.559
- Hey, Bleeder!
- What?

04:02.640 --> 04:04.472
Let it go. Let it go. Let it go!

04:04.560 --> 04:06.597
Shit. Bad?

04:06.680 --> 04:08.160
Come on AI, let me see the cut.

04:10.840 --> 04:11.876
Looks pretty bad.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.474
All right, get the fuck out of this corner,

04:13.560 --> 04:15.279
and don't bother me
while I'm working, all right?

04:15.400 --> 04:17.357
<i>Whatever we had to do, we did.</i>

04:17.440 --> 04:21.639
<i>Al and I had an agreement, always</i>
<i>move forward and never stop the fight.</i>

04:21.720 --> 04:23.120
AI, let the doc see the cut.

04:23.240 --> 04:24.913
Sure, have a look there.

04:26.880 --> 04:28.792
- Yeah, he's good. He's good.
- Thanks, Doc.

04:28.880 --> 04:31.031
<i>They called Al "The Butcher,"</i>
<i>but it wasn't just him.</i>

04:31.120 --> 04:32.554
<i>I wouldn't stop, either.</i>

04:32.720 --> 04:35.394
<i>Besides, it wasn't his fault I bled so much.</i>

04:35.480 --> 04:36.960
I cannot close this fuckin' cut.

04:37.040 --> 04:39.350
It's time to send
this fuckin' Mormon back to Utah.

04:39.440 --> 04:40.669
- Are you with me?
- Yeah.

04:40.800 --> 04:41.836
- All right, let's do it.
- Go.

04:41.920 --> 04:44.071
You're on, Chuck. You're on. Hit him.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.712
<i>And the winner by knockout,</i>

04:53.800 --> 04:57.396
<i>in two minutes and 18 seconds</i>
<i>of the 11th round,</i>

04:57.480 --> 05:02.077
<i>and still the North American and</i>
<i>New Jersey heavyweight champion,</i>

05:02.160 --> 05:03.833
<i>Chuck Wepner!</i>

05:08.760 --> 05:09.796
Hey, baby.

05:09.880 --> 05:11.473
Daddy, were you boxing again?

05:11.560 --> 05:13.552
Yeah, as a matter of fact, I was.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.633
Is that why your face looks so funny?

05:18.560 --> 05:20.279
No, sweetheart.

05:20.360 --> 05:21.680
Daddy's face always looks funny.

05:21.800 --> 05:24.759
The other guy was just trying to
spruce it up for me a bit.

05:24.840 --> 05:26.399
Come here, give me some sugar.

05:27.240 --> 05:29.311
Come on, Kimby. It's 8:00.

05:29.400 --> 05:30.880
You gotta eat your breakfast. Go. Go, go, go.

05:30.960 --> 05:32.110
Bye, Daddy.

05:41.080 --> 05:42.230
Come here, let me look at you.

05:43.080 --> 05:44.150
I'm all right.

05:44.280 --> 05:45.600
Come here, baby.

05:48.520 --> 05:49.920
- Let me see.
- It's my ribs.

05:52.240 --> 05:53.594
Chuck, you look terrible.

05:53.680 --> 05:55.831
I'll be as handsome as ever a couple of days.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.400
Here, gimme some of that.

05:57.480 --> 05:59.119
Yeah.

06:00.400 --> 06:02.153
And a little bit of that!

06:02.240 --> 06:05.074
Chuck, no. Come on,
I have to get Kimberly to school.

06:05.160 --> 06:06.992
Plus, I'm still mad at you.

06:07.080 --> 06:09.037
- Will you stop with that, please?
- No!

06:09.120 --> 06:11.760
It's one of Arty's girls. I swear to God,
I never put a hand on her.

06:11.840 --> 06:13.240
It's not your hands I'm worried about.

06:13.320 --> 06:16.358
- I wrote you another poem.
- You can keep your poems.

06:16.480 --> 06:19.075
It's a good one.
Put it on the fridge for you.

06:19.160 --> 06:20.230
Yeah?

06:20.320 --> 06:22.277
- Come on, let me put it in.
- No!

06:22.400 --> 06:24.710
- Just the tip.
- Chuck! No!

06:24.800 --> 06:27.269
- Yeah, come on!
- Chuck, come on! I have 15 minutes...

06:27.360 --> 06:28.555
Fuck!

06:28.640 --> 06:31.872
...to drop her off and get to work!
God. I'm late.

06:38.240 --> 06:39.799
<i>"My One and Only.</i>

06:39.920 --> 06:41.798
<i>"You alone are in my heart</i>

06:41.920 --> 06:44.389
<i>"From break of day till evening start</i>

06:44.480 --> 06:46.312
<i>"All the while I think of you</i>

06:46.400 --> 06:48.960
<i>"And the lucky day that made us two."</i>

06:49.040 --> 06:51.077
<i>I wrote Phyll poems all the time.</i>

06:51.160 --> 06:52.833
<i>Left them around for her, you know?</i>

07:01.760 --> 07:04.594
How you doin'? Chuck Wepner.
Life treating you good?

07:05.680 --> 07:07.034
<i>There was another fighter,</i>

07:07.120 --> 07:08.839
<i>name of Frankie Suppone,</i>
<i>owned the liquor route.</i>

07:08.920 --> 07:12.072
<i>He was retiring, said I had a good</i>
<i>personality and I should take his route.</i>

07:12.200 --> 07:13.600
<i>I'd make a good liquor salesman.</i>

07:13.680 --> 07:15.478
How you doin'? Chuck Wepner.

07:15.560 --> 07:17.552
Let me ask you something, you like Dewar's?

07:17.640 --> 07:18.790
<i>I figured, what the hell?</i>

07:18.880 --> 07:22.396
<i>I may be ranked eighth in the world,</i>
<i>but I still need a freakin' job.</i>

07:23.680 --> 07:25.672
<i>Before that,</i>
<i>I was a bouncer for a couple of years,</i>

07:25.760 --> 07:28.434
<i>then a debt collector for Frank Giglio.</i>

07:28.520 --> 07:31.957
<i>I was never good at roughing guys up.</i>
<i>Too nice.</i>

07:32.040 --> 07:33.952
<i>Felt sorry for them, you know?</i>

07:34.040 --> 07:36.430
<i>Besides, who wants to hang out</i>
<i>with a leg breaker</i>

07:36.560 --> 07:39.837
<i>when you could be rubbing elbows with</i>
<i>the heavyweight champ of New Jersey?</i>

07:41.040 --> 07:43.271
Hey, Champ! Nice fight with Hinke last night.

07:43.400 --> 07:45.631
- Thanks, Joe.
- You really creamed his Mormon ass.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.916
Hey, hey. Bayonne makes,
the world takes, baby.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.150
You got it, brother.

07:50.480 --> 07:52.711
- Hello, hello, hello.
- Hey, here he is!

07:52.800 --> 07:54.678
Congratulations!

07:54.760 --> 07:56.672
Hey, congrats.

07:56.760 --> 07:58.274
- How you doin'?
- Way to go, Champ.

07:58.360 --> 08:01.398
- How are you, Pete?
- Good. How's the face?

08:01.480 --> 08:04.075
How's my face? I don't know.
What do you think?

08:04.160 --> 08:06.834
- You're gorgeous. You're beautiful.
- Improvement, right?

08:06.920 --> 08:08.115
Beautiful.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.397
- Where's Johnny?
- Where the fuck you think I am?

08:11.840 --> 08:14.230
I'm bleeding the lizard,
and my prostate is fuckin' killing me.

08:14.320 --> 08:16.118
So, don't try to hustle me today, Chuck, huh?

08:16.200 --> 08:18.157
Johnny D, this is me. Who's hustling?

08:18.240 --> 08:19.993
You know I already got a deal
with those other guys.

08:20.080 --> 08:21.992
I got something I wanna show you.

08:22.080 --> 08:24.914
Look at this. See that?

08:25.960 --> 08:28.520
- That's my girl, Dot.
- Dot?

08:28.600 --> 08:30.034
Yeah, well, I call her Dotty.

08:30.120 --> 08:34.511
See, you turn her over
and she goes from Dotty to Naughty.

08:34.600 --> 08:37.320
- Yeah. That's beautiful.
- You like that? Who wants one?

08:37.400 --> 08:39.676
- I'll take one. All right.
- There you go.

08:39.760 --> 08:42.355
- I got one for all of you.
- How you doin', Champ?

08:42.440 --> 08:44.078
I'm good. How you doin'?

08:45.600 --> 08:47.432
Johnny, how much Wolfschmidts you want?

08:47.520 --> 08:49.398
All right, how bad
you gonna bang me up for two cases?

08:49.480 --> 08:51.517
Well, Johnny, for you,

08:51.600 --> 08:54.513
I'm gonna make you a very special deal.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.398
- Wolfschmidts, right?
- Yeah. Two.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.509
Black and blue,
and you still look good, Champ.

09:10.080 --> 09:11.719
- Hey, Champ.
- How are you?

09:11.800 --> 09:13.120
Hey, Chuck!

09:15.240 --> 09:18.278
Yeah, no, of course. Yeah, but listen...

09:18.360 --> 09:21.319
I mean, it takes two people to dance,
isn't that right?

09:21.400 --> 09:23.232
No, no, no.
Hey, calm down a little bit, okay?

09:23.320 --> 09:24.436
What's up?

09:24.520 --> 09:27.160
Listen to me! Listen to me!
All right, listen to me, you fuckin' gonif!

09:29.480 --> 09:31.676
No... I mean...

09:33.240 --> 09:34.833
You got yourself a deal.

09:36.840 --> 09:38.672
Yeah. You, too. I'll see ya.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.754
How's the cut? Let me look at you.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.432
- What's that for?
- I wanna see if you're gonna bleed.

09:48.520 --> 09:50.512
Jesus, AI!
You nearly took my fuckin' head off!

09:50.600 --> 09:53.035
It's a good thing I know
how to take care of your cuts.

09:53.120 --> 09:55.077
Stormin' Mormon
almost turned you into a cyclops.

09:55.160 --> 09:56.753
- Stop!
- You fuckin' hemophiliac.

09:56.840 --> 09:57.990
Who was on the phone?

10:00.760 --> 10:03.832
AI, come on, I know you got
something going on. Who was that?

10:06.200 --> 10:07.714
That was Don King.

10:09.040 --> 10:10.190
No shit.

10:12.120 --> 10:14.589
Because of the beatin' you put on Hinke,

10:15.960 --> 10:18.998
I'm looking at a guy
who's got a shot at the heavyweight title.

10:20.440 --> 10:21.954
You fuckin' Polack.

10:23.480 --> 10:25.631
After Foreman takes care
of Mahatma in Zaire...

10:25.720 --> 10:26.949
It's Muhammad, AI. His name's Muhammad.

10:27.040 --> 10:28.235
You should say it right, okay?

10:28.320 --> 10:31.074
I don't give a fuck if it's Mukluk!
All right?

10:31.160 --> 10:34.949
When Foreman knocks Ali on his ass,
you're in.

10:37.560 --> 10:38.596
And what if Ali wins?

10:38.680 --> 10:40.637
Foreman is a fuckin' monster. It's a lock.

10:40.720 --> 10:42.154
I got...

10:43.040 --> 10:44.633
- Title shot, huh?
- That's right, kid.

10:45.360 --> 10:49.320
Hey, this is your lucky day.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.392
AI, lucky day, lucky man.

10:52.400 --> 10:53.754
Come here.

10:53.880 --> 10:55.234
I love you, AI.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.320
Thank you.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.835
- Come on, you're missing it.
- Okay, okay.

11:01.400 --> 11:04.279
<i>Uppercut. Sucker punch.</i>

11:04.360 --> 11:06.397
<i>That night, my favorite movie,</i>

11:06.480 --> 11:08.995
<i>Anthony Quinn,</i> Requiem for a Heavyweight.

11:09.080 --> 11:10.434
<i>Broke my heart, that movie.</i>

11:10.520 --> 11:12.955
<i>You see that, you can't help</i>
<i>but see yourself.</i>

11:13.440 --> 11:15.557
<i>Who have been your past employers?</i>

11:15.640 --> 11:20.476
<i>Well, you see, all I been doin'</i>
<i>for the past 17 years is fighting.</i>

11:22.160 --> 11:25.437
<i>You know, in the ring.</i>
<i>Man, in the prize ring.</i>

11:27.560 --> 11:28.880
<i>You mean a prizefighter?</i>

11:29.000 --> 11:30.354
Here it comes, here it comes.

11:31.200 --> 11:34.876
<i>Miss, I ain't got no special problem.</i>

11:34.960 --> 11:37.031
<i>Now, to you I'm a big, ugly slob...</i>

11:37.120 --> 11:38.873
"...and I look like a freak.

11:39.200 --> 11:43.194
"But I was almost the heavyweight
champion of the world.

11:43.960 --> 11:47.032
"Why don't you put that down

11:47.120 --> 11:49.316
"Mountain Rivera was no punk.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.837
"Mountain Rivera was almost
the heavyweight champion of the world."

11:55.720 --> 11:57.552
You know what my old man used to say to me?

11:57.640 --> 11:58.869
What?

11:58.960 --> 12:02.556
He said, "When you're with a lady,
you gotta treat her special."

12:02.640 --> 12:03.710
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.871
- How special?
- Very special.

12:05.960 --> 12:09.112
- Yeah?
- Especially a lady like you.

12:10.360 --> 12:11.635
With freckles.

12:12.640 --> 12:15.075
- You like my freckles?
- I like your freckles.

12:16.920 --> 12:19.640
Especially this part in here.

12:31.360 --> 12:33.317
What are they fighting in Africa for?

12:33.440 --> 12:36.990
I don't know. Two black fighters? Publicity?

12:37.080 --> 12:38.958
Trust me, Don King knows what he's doing.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.912
Hey, Champ. What the hell? Come with me.

12:42.000 --> 12:45.072
Jimmy! Appreciate it. You know Phyll, right?

12:45.200 --> 12:46.680
- Hey, how you doing?
- Hey, how you doing, Champ?

12:46.760 --> 12:48.672
- I hear you're next on the menu, huh?
- Yeah.

12:48.760 --> 12:50.831
Is that right? You gonna fight Foreman, huh?

12:50.920 --> 12:52.070
That's what they say.

12:52.160 --> 12:53.594
Move it! You got the Champ here!

12:53.680 --> 12:55.319
Hey, how you doin'?

12:55.400 --> 12:56.675
Yo, Bleeder!

12:58.360 --> 13:00.352
- Chuck, just don't...
- It's all right.

13:00.440 --> 13:01.510
Yo.

13:03.720 --> 13:04.790
Hey.

13:06.280 --> 13:07.839
What'd you call me?

13:07.920 --> 13:09.320
The Bleeder, that's what everybody calls you.

13:09.400 --> 13:10.800
The Bayonne Bleeder.

13:11.720 --> 13:14.030
- How you doin'?
- I'm good. You?

13:14.120 --> 13:16.112
- Good. Like the fights, huh?
- Hey.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.395
Sure.

13:17.480 --> 13:19.631
- What the fuck!
- Chuck!

13:21.880 --> 13:24.873
Relax, Champ. Come back for you
when I'm done with Foreman.

13:25.840 --> 13:27.160
Hey, Champ, who you like?

13:27.320 --> 13:29.960
- What are you doing, Chuck?
- Nothing. Just messing with him.

13:30.240 --> 13:31.469
What are you trying to do?

13:31.560 --> 13:34.075
Just don't worry about it, baby. It's okay.

13:34.160 --> 13:36.152
<i>Foreman comes stalking across the ring,</i>

13:36.240 --> 13:39.153
<i>delivering some light hooks</i>
<i>to the body of Ali</i>

13:39.240 --> 13:41.471
<i>that certainly are doing no problems,</i>

13:41.560 --> 13:43.791
<i>or causing any problems to Muhammad Ali.</i>

13:43.880 --> 13:45.837
<i>Ali spins him around out of the corner now.</i>

13:45.920 --> 13:46.990
<i>They're very even...</i>

13:47.080 --> 13:48.150
- He looks good.
- Who?

13:48.240 --> 13:49.310
<i>Ali, a sneaky right hand.</i>

13:49.400 --> 13:50.470
Ali.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.400
Don't worry, Foreman will get him.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.391
<i>If you had asked me</i>
<i>or any other bum on the street,</i>

14:03.480 --> 14:05.915
<i>"Was Ali gonna beat</i>
<i>'Big George' Foreman in Zaire?"</i>

14:06.000 --> 14:07.593
<i>I'd have said, "Hell no."</i>

14:08.920 --> 14:10.070
<i>But he did it.</i>

14:12.080 --> 14:14.754
<i>What were they gonna do,</i>
<i>put me in the ring with Ali?</i>

14:15.840 --> 14:17.593
Let's go home, baby. Come on.

14:21.680 --> 14:23.911
I don't know,

14:24.000 --> 14:27.357
I think I might hit the diner,
maybe get a cup of coffee or something.

14:27.440 --> 14:29.432
All right. You want company?

14:30.640 --> 14:33.109
No, I gotta walk.

14:33.200 --> 14:34.873
You go home. I'll be all right.

14:37.200 --> 14:38.475
You sure?

14:39.880 --> 14:42.873
Yeah. I just, you know...
I gotta walk, that's all.

14:44.880 --> 14:45.950
Fine.

14:47.320 --> 14:50.279
<i>It was like watching my future</i>
<i>go down the toilet.</i>

14:50.360 --> 14:53.034
<i>Phyll tried to help,</i>
<i>but I was after something else.</i>

14:54.960 --> 14:56.633
<i>Something I shouldn't have.</i>

15:01.800 --> 15:04.235
It was after the Foreman fight, yeah.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.915
I took a beating, so I figured
I'd get myself something nice, you know.

15:07.000 --> 15:09.435
That's real nice. That's shiny.

15:09.520 --> 15:11.751
If I rub it, does something lucky happen?

15:14.840 --> 15:17.958
- Phyll.
- Coffee, black. Thanks.

15:18.040 --> 15:19.759
- Excuse me!
- No, don't apologize.

15:19.840 --> 15:22.071
This is my...

15:22.160 --> 15:23.640
His wife. Your wife.

15:23.720 --> 15:24.949
Shit.

15:25.040 --> 15:27.271
No, no, no. It's okay. It's okay.

15:27.360 --> 15:29.431
Trust me. It's not your fault.

15:29.520 --> 15:32.991
This is just what he does.
It happens all the time, okay?

15:33.080 --> 15:34.912
He sees a bimbo like you, you know,

15:35.000 --> 15:36.673
don't even have to be pretty, and you're not.

15:36.880 --> 15:39.918
And the bimbo says,
"I got freckles on my ass."

15:40.200 --> 15:42.795
And boom! Chuck here falls in love.

15:44.040 --> 15:46.953
He just falls in love
with the freckles on your ass.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.793
I don't have freckles on my ass.

15:48.880 --> 15:51.111
- Phyll, please...
- Shut up. I'm talking here.

15:51.200 --> 15:53.920
Of course you don't have freckles
on your ass. That's not the point.

15:54.000 --> 15:57.198
You don't have anything at all to
recommend you, but that don't matter.

15:57.280 --> 15:59.112
See, you're just the next person in line.

15:59.200 --> 16:03.194
The next person who looks at him
like he's something special.

16:03.280 --> 16:06.478
You look at him like that, you got him.

16:06.560 --> 16:09.951
No, no, no, it's okay. Stay.
You need to hear this.

16:10.040 --> 16:13.477
See, you think you're special
because of those freckles, right?

16:13.560 --> 16:17.190
And maybe you even marry him.
And have a baby with him.

16:17.280 --> 16:22.594
And go through fuckin' hell with him.
Year after year after year.

16:23.640 --> 16:27.156
Because you think that'll make him stick.

16:27.240 --> 16:32.440
That'll make him yours. Just yours.
Only yours forever.

16:35.480 --> 16:36.755
But you're wrong.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.070
You see?

16:41.080 --> 16:42.480
You're just so fuckin' wrong.

16:54.320 --> 16:58.234
I'm taking Kimberly to my mom's.
You do what you want.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.071
- Phyll...
- Fuck you, Chuck.

17:14.720 --> 17:17.838
<i>Hey, what is this, a typing class?</i>

17:17.920 --> 17:20.878
<i>All right, I'll give you a weather report.</i>
<i>The temperatures are rising.</i>

17:20.960 --> 17:22.109
<i>I need a dime, fatso.</i>

17:24.760 --> 17:27.275
<i>Forget it, we're even. Crocker.</i>

17:36.720 --> 17:37.915
Hello?

17:38.000 --> 17:39.400
<i>It's me, Al.</i>

17:39.480 --> 17:40.550
Hey, AI.

17:40.640 --> 17:43.235
What are you doin'? You sittin' down?

17:43.320 --> 17:44.800
<i>Yeah, I'm watching</i> Kojak.

17:46.800 --> 17:49.076
- They're looking for a white guy.
<i>- What?</i>

17:49.160 --> 17:50.560
What are you talking about?

17:50.640 --> 17:53.235
<i>Don King wants to make this whole fight</i>
<i>a race thing.</i>

17:53.320 --> 17:55.198
So, he wants Ali to fight a white guy,

17:55.280 --> 17:57.749
and since you're the only one
in the fuckin' top 10...

17:57.840 --> 18:00.480
You hear me, bubala? You hear me?

18:01.280 --> 18:03.237
You're the fuckin' white guy!

18:05.320 --> 18:09.030
<i>Sometimes you just can't believe</i>
<i>your own dumb luck.</i>

18:10.040 --> 18:14.080
<i>Don King decided to get creative.</i>
<i>All they needed was a white guy.</i>

18:14.360 --> 18:17.671
<i>And by process of elimination, that was me.</i>

18:17.840 --> 18:20.071
<i>Ali could've been purple for all I cared.</i>

18:20.200 --> 18:22.556
<i>They wanted me, Chuck Wepner.</i>

18:22.640 --> 18:24.836
<i>The bum from Bayonne was getting a shot</i>

18:24.920 --> 18:27.230
<i>at the heavyweight champion of the world.</i>

18:39.800 --> 18:43.032
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, Phyll, it's me. You hear the news?</i>

18:45.120 --> 18:46.634
Yeah, it was on the radio.

18:46.720 --> 18:49.155
<i>- Pretty great, huh?</i>
- Yeah, it's great, Chuck.

18:49.240 --> 18:51.277
But right now your daughter
is staying at Grandma's house

18:51.400 --> 18:53.676
because Mommy caught Daddy
with his hands in some panties

18:53.760 --> 18:55.433
that didn't belong to Mommy.

18:55.520 --> 18:59.992
Yeah. No, I know. I'm sorry.

19:01.480 --> 19:04.791
This is big for me, though, you know?
Big moment, huh?

19:04.880 --> 19:06.917
Yeah, lucky day, lucky man, right?

19:07.040 --> 19:12.195
<i>Yeah. I just wanna share it</i>
<i>with you guys. Be a family?</i>

19:13.720 --> 19:15.712
Used to be a family here, Phyll.

19:18.160 --> 19:20.231
Phyll? You there?

19:20.320 --> 19:21.879
Yeah, I'm here.

19:22.680 --> 19:25.275
<i>I'm gonna train full-time</i>
<i>up in the Catskills.</i>

19:25.360 --> 19:27.033
I never had that before.

19:27.120 --> 19:29.760
This is the real thing, you know?
This is different.

19:29.840 --> 19:32.309
I mean, everything's gonna be
different now, baby.

19:34.600 --> 19:37.434
Congratulations, Chuck.
I'm real happy for you, I am.

19:38.480 --> 19:41.040
Phyll? Phyll?

19:41.120 --> 19:42.679
<i>Everything was different.</i>

19:42.760 --> 19:44.831
<i>I was fighting Muhammad Ali.</i>

19:44.920 --> 19:47.196
<i>The big press conference was in New York.</i>

19:47.280 --> 19:51.115
<i>I figured I'd better be prepared if I was</i>
<i>gonna get a word in edgewise with Ali.</i>

19:51.480 --> 19:54.552
He's one of the most formidable foes,
I think, that could come into the ring.

19:54.640 --> 19:57.792
He has an 18-inch neck
and a solid-rock granite jaw.

19:57.920 --> 19:59.957
So, I think that Ali's in
for an interesting evening,

20:00.040 --> 20:02.236
and he's not taking it lightly,
he's taking it serious.

20:05.360 --> 20:08.717
Muhammad is the master of the poem,
so I wrote a poem.

20:09.840 --> 20:10.990
Goes like this.

20:12.200 --> 20:13.919
"What's in a word?

20:14.000 --> 20:15.832
"And who's to say what will be?

20:16.800 --> 20:20.032
"But there are those who say that
he's the best to ever wear the crown

20:20.120 --> 20:23.875
"And that this fight's a tune-up
against someone of little renown

20:25.320 --> 20:27.710
"I proved them wrong time and time again

20:27.800 --> 20:29.871
"And won my fights in spite of them

20:31.520 --> 20:33.398
"So, don't write me off or count me out..."

20:33.480 --> 20:35.199
Hold on, Chuck. Hold on.

20:37.320 --> 20:40.074
Did you have a feeling
that was gonna happen? 'Cause I didn't.

20:40.160 --> 20:41.230
What you gotta say now, Champ?

20:41.320 --> 20:44.472
Don King say
they gonna leave feminine napkins...

20:44.560 --> 20:45.755
Okay.

20:45.840 --> 20:47.194
...in Chuck's corner.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.714
Because the way he bleed,

20:48.800 --> 20:50.757
that's gonna be the only thing
that mop up the blood.

20:50.840 --> 20:53.071
I will beat him,

20:53.160 --> 20:56.392
but no punches gonna land here, here.
Only in here.

20:56.480 --> 20:57.755
All right. All right. All right. Okay.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.036
'Cause I don't want no excuses about cuts.

21:02.800 --> 21:05.360
- Are you done? Yeah?
- For the moment.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.918
<i>So I took what I could get</i>

21:18.720 --> 21:21.280
<i>She looked at me with her big brown eyes</i>

21:21.360 --> 21:23.955
<i>And said, you ain't seen nothing yet</i>

21:24.040 --> 21:25.110
<i>Bop, bop</i>

21:25.200 --> 21:27.840
<i>Baby, you just ain't seen nothing yet</i>

21:27.920 --> 21:29.070
<i>Bop, bop</i>

21:32.120 --> 21:34.919
<i>We trained at the Granit Hotel</i>
<i>in upstate New York.</i>

21:35.000 --> 21:38.550
<i>This place was top shelf. I mean,</i>
<i>I never seen anything like it in my life.</i>

21:39.200 --> 21:40.998
Come on, huh?

21:41.080 --> 21:42.594
I think you got a pool in your room, bro.

21:42.680 --> 21:45.115
I heard they got two pools.

21:45.240 --> 21:47.277
<i>I had my own room, separate dining room.</i>

21:47.360 --> 21:50.159
<i>No menu. I just, you know,</i>
<i>ordered whatever I wanted.</i>

21:50.240 --> 21:54.439
<i>This was professional.</i>
<i>Finally, I was training like a pro.</i>

21:54.520 --> 21:57.035
<i>It was a big step up</i>
<i>for a club fighter from Bayonne.</i>

21:59.720 --> 22:01.234
Hey, Chuck. Hey, Chuck.

22:02.240 --> 22:03.469
How are you?

22:03.560 --> 22:05.313
Yes, yes. That's what we're talking about.

22:06.480 --> 22:07.709
Let's hear about this fight.

22:07.800 --> 22:09.473
How's it going, guys? All right.

22:09.560 --> 22:11.836
- One at a time. One at a time.
- How you doing? Good to see you.

22:11.920 --> 22:13.320
Where's the guy from the <i>New Jersey Sun?</i>

22:13.400 --> 22:15.551
- I'm here.
- Get him up front.

22:15.640 --> 22:17.518
Some people are calling this fight
a joke, Chuck.

22:17.600 --> 22:18.636
What do you think of that?

22:18.720 --> 22:21.440
They're saying it's a fight between
an artist and a house painter.

22:21.520 --> 22:24.035
Yeah? Well, that's nice
they call me an artist.

22:24.120 --> 22:26.476
<i>I'm in the best shape of my life,</i>
<i>so we'll see.</i>

22:26.600 --> 22:27.875
What are you gonna tell the fans

22:27.960 --> 22:29.997
who think that this fight isn't worth
the price of admission?

22:30.080 --> 22:32.993
They said that? Don't worry,
they'll get their money's worth.

22:33.120 --> 22:35.874
<i>- How do you plan to fight him, Chuck?</i>
- I'm fighting Bayonne style.

22:36.760 --> 22:38.956
What do you mean, you're gonna
bleed in his mouth until he drowns?

22:40.600 --> 22:43.479
Look, why don't you guys get
some new shtick, all right?

22:43.560 --> 22:45.199
The only cut Chuck needs to worry about

22:45.280 --> 22:46.396
is what I'm taking out of his purse.

22:46.480 --> 22:48.790
How do you define Bayonne style?

22:48.880 --> 22:49.916
Dirty.

22:50.000 --> 22:53.038
Rabbit punches to the back of the head,
kidney punches.

22:53.120 --> 22:54.873
Ali's gonna be pissing blood for a week.

22:54.960 --> 22:56.599
What about the sweet science?

22:56.680 --> 22:59.320
Sweet science ain't so sweet, you got
a pile driver in your nuts, you know?

23:00.120 --> 23:01.793
All right, fellas, thank you very much.

23:01.880 --> 23:03.678
That's gonna be it for today, all right?

23:03.760 --> 23:05.956
Come on, we got a few more questions.

23:06.480 --> 23:08.551
"Wepner giving free transfusions."

23:08.640 --> 23:10.711
"Bayonne's one-man blood bank."

23:10.800 --> 23:14.316
Jesus Christ, these fuckin' writers.
Fuckin' animals.

23:14.520 --> 23:16.637
Champ, you got this, man.

23:31.240 --> 23:33.436
<i>John Stahl was my best friend.</i>

23:33.520 --> 23:35.830
<i>Knew each other since we were kids.</i>

23:35.920 --> 23:37.957
<i>You need someone like that in life.</i>

23:38.040 --> 23:40.157
<i>Someone who'll always answer the phone.</i>

23:40.240 --> 23:41.356
Hello?

23:41.480 --> 23:44.040
<i>Hey, John. I'm not calling too late, am I?</i>

23:45.160 --> 23:48.119
Hey. No.

23:48.360 --> 23:49.635
I was just...

23:50.040 --> 23:52.316
I was putting together
the orders for tomorrow.

23:53.160 --> 23:56.358
Thanks for covering my route, pal.
I really appreciate it. I owe you one.

23:56.440 --> 23:59.558
<i>Yeah, yeah. You got it. Everything okay?</i>

23:59.640 --> 24:02.360
Yeah, yeah. I was just...

24:02.440 --> 24:05.194
I just remembered that Vic over
at Sabatino's Lounge in Hoboken?

24:05.280 --> 24:08.432
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- He gets extra cocktail napkins.

24:08.520 --> 24:10.557
I don't know if he's wiping his ass
with them, or what.

24:10.640 --> 24:13.360
<i>Yeah, yeah, I did it, Chuck. I did it.</i>

24:15.400 --> 24:17.312
<i>Good to hear from you, Chuck.</i>

24:17.400 --> 24:20.757
Yeah. Yeah.

24:24.920 --> 24:26.115
You seen Phyll?

24:26.200 --> 24:28.920
<i>Yeah, I saw her at the City Hall Park, but...</i>

24:31.400 --> 24:32.629
How she doing?

24:34.240 --> 24:35.640
I don't know.

24:36.760 --> 24:39.070
I'd really like her to come.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.469
You know, to the fight?

24:41.560 --> 24:42.710
<i>You want me to call her?</i>

24:42.840 --> 24:45.639
Swing by or something?

24:45.720 --> 24:47.393
Nah, that's okay. I was gonna...

24:49.280 --> 24:51.920
- Would you mind?
<i>- No. I mean, I'll talk to her.</i>

24:55.080 --> 24:56.480
There she is!

24:58.240 --> 24:59.674
Pretty lady.

24:59.760 --> 25:01.353
Hey, John. What are you doing here?

25:01.440 --> 25:06.071
Well, I was hoping you could give me
some discount on some stamps.

25:06.160 --> 25:08.152
For postcards.

25:08.240 --> 25:10.550
I figured I'd be sending some from Cleveland.

25:12.280 --> 25:14.715
- I'm busy here, John. You can see...
- Hurry up, pal!

25:14.800 --> 25:16.314
Settle down, dickhead.

25:18.440 --> 25:19.510
What do you say?

25:21.360 --> 25:22.794
What do you want me to say?

25:22.880 --> 25:26.669
Sure? Why not? No big deal?
It is a big deal, John.

25:27.480 --> 25:29.915
Do you have any idea
what it's been like for me?

25:30.000 --> 25:31.400
For my kid?

25:32.080 --> 25:33.309
Even thought about what you're asking?

25:34.440 --> 25:36.591
- He needs you, Phyllis.
- No.

25:40.440 --> 25:42.477
<i>- Can you beat Muhammad?</i>
<i>- What?</i>

25:42.600 --> 25:45.195
<i>- Can you beat Muhammad?</i>
<i>- Yeah, absolutely, Mike.</i>

25:45.280 --> 25:49.115
<i>I've been waiting 11 years for this,</i>
<i>you know, so, I'm hungry.</i>

25:50.800 --> 25:53.269
<i>You hear that? The man just said he's hungry.</i>

25:53.880 --> 25:55.314
<i>He better go get himself something to eat.</i>

25:56.520 --> 25:58.955
<i>How about two all-beef patties</i>
<i>with special sauce?</i>

26:02.600 --> 26:05.320
<i>I never been scared of nobody my entire life,</i>

26:05.400 --> 26:10.031
<i>but looking at my face for the first time</i>
<i>on that box, it was tough.</i>

26:27.680 --> 26:29.000
How you doing, boychik?

26:31.160 --> 26:32.992
- What's that?
- It's for you.

26:33.080 --> 26:35.390
I guess somebody sent you some coconuts.

26:35.480 --> 26:40.509
Gorilla balls.
My brother. It's a inside joke.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.114
- Your brother?
- Yeah.

26:43.360 --> 26:46.080
- I didn't even know you had a brother.
- No, we don't talk that much.

26:46.760 --> 26:49.275
- So, why'd he send those?
- I don't know.

26:53.040 --> 26:56.511
Hey, bubby. What's going on?

26:57.880 --> 26:59.360
I gotta go the full ride, AI.

27:00.440 --> 27:02.716
I can't look people in the eye
if I don't make it 15 rounds.

27:03.960 --> 27:05.553
Forty to one, you know that?

27:06.800 --> 27:09.269
That's the odds they're giving me, 40 to 1.

27:09.360 --> 27:11.431
Stop being such a fuckin' pussy, you hear me?

27:13.040 --> 27:14.394
Trust me, all right?

27:15.040 --> 27:17.794
Ali is gonna look like
the schvartze putz of the century

27:18.040 --> 27:19.872
when you knock him out.

27:21.280 --> 27:22.714
You hear me?

27:27.240 --> 27:28.799
Special delivery.

27:28.880 --> 27:30.360
John, what the fuck are you doing here?

27:30.440 --> 27:31.920
You're supposed to be on my liquor route.

27:32.000 --> 27:35.914
Relax. No one's left in Bayonne to drink.
Everyone's in Cleveland.

27:36.000 --> 27:37.878
- Hello, AI.
- Hey, Phyll.

27:39.640 --> 27:41.711
- Friend or foe?
- Friend.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.230
That's good.

27:44.760 --> 27:47.320
You do know
he's got a fight tomorrow night, right?

27:47.400 --> 27:48.834
- Yeah, I know.
- Okay.

27:52.440 --> 27:53.635
Thanks.

28:01.600 --> 28:05.992
You see the Mike Douglas thing?

28:07.240 --> 28:08.276
No.

28:32.800 --> 28:33.950
Let me look at you.

28:49.480 --> 28:52.678
<i>The new, not-so-well-known</i>
<i>Cleveland Coliseum,</i>

28:52.760 --> 28:55.229
<i>where Muhammad Ali will be fighting tonight.</i>

28:56.120 --> 28:57.713
<i>On this, the day of his title defense,</i>

28:57.840 --> 29:00.560
<i>Muhammad Ali spent his time resting, eating,</i>

29:00.640 --> 29:02.632
<i>and visiting the site</i>
<i>of his planned shopping mall</i>

29:02.800 --> 29:04.200
<i>on Cleveland's East Side.</i>

29:26.480 --> 29:27.516
Come on.

29:30.680 --> 29:32.034
You like?

29:32.120 --> 29:35.079
Yeah, I like.
I like it better when you take it off.

29:35.160 --> 29:36.560
Yeah, I bet.

29:41.360 --> 29:43.591
- What are you doing? Stop it.
- Come here. I wanna look at you.

29:45.280 --> 29:47.237
- You know how gorgeous you are?
- Thank you.

29:51.200 --> 29:52.839
All right, get out. I gotta get changed.

29:52.920 --> 29:55.196
I don't wanna go back out there.
The lady is giving me the stink eye.

29:55.280 --> 29:56.350
Okay.

30:04.040 --> 30:06.874
Ali's saying he's gonna knock me out
in three rounds like I'm nothing.

30:08.400 --> 30:10.710
Like I didn't belong there
in the first place.

30:13.120 --> 30:16.033
I gotta show them, Phyll, you know?

30:16.120 --> 30:17.952
I gotta show them I belong there.

30:18.040 --> 30:21.078
Show who, Chuck? Who you gotta show?

30:21.160 --> 30:24.756
You know, you know... Them.

30:27.840 --> 30:29.513
Okay, "them."

30:32.240 --> 30:34.596
Hey. Come here.

30:34.680 --> 30:36.114
Come on, stop.

30:37.720 --> 30:38.790
What?

30:40.120 --> 30:41.236
I don't know, I just...

30:43.160 --> 30:45.152
I don't wanna see you get hurt, Chuck.

30:46.520 --> 30:48.034
I don't like seeing it.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.559
I don't care about getting hurt.

30:51.960 --> 30:54.680
I just gotta show them I belong, you know?

30:54.880 --> 30:56.712
Go the distance.

30:57.840 --> 30:58.956
Yeah.

31:00.200 --> 31:04.114
<i>Why are you here, spending</i>
<i>the kind of money that you did on tickets</i>

31:04.200 --> 31:06.192
<i>to see Ali and Wepner?</i>

31:08.440 --> 31:11.194
<i>Ali's a good fighter. He's the best.</i>

31:12.320 --> 31:15.392
<i>Well, a lot of people think that</i>
<i>it's gonna be a quick fight.</i>

31:15.480 --> 31:17.073
<i>I think it's gonna be a good one.</i>

31:17.160 --> 31:22.076
<i>So, I got mixed emotions, but I'd</i>
<i>like to see Muhammad Ali win in five.</i>

31:22.160 --> 31:27.030
<i>Well, I enjoy Muhammad Ali,</i>
<i>and, you know, that's the whole kit.</i>

31:27.120 --> 31:29.396
<i>And I call him one of</i>
<i>the greatest performers there are.</i>

31:57.360 --> 32:02.230
<i>Let's face it, nobody gave me</i>
<i>a chance in hell. But I didn't care.</i>

32:02.320 --> 32:04.676
<i>For me to turn around and see Muhammad Ali</i>

32:04.760 --> 32:08.800
<i>standing right there in front of me,</i>
<i>15 million people watching,</i>

32:08.960 --> 32:10.599
<i>that was the best.</i>

32:11.000 --> 32:12.992
<i>I'll never forget that feeling.</i>

32:14.400 --> 32:17.074
<i>Bell rings, I rush forward</i>
<i>trying to be aggressive.</i>

32:17.160 --> 32:19.800
<i>Ali's dancing around me talking.</i>
<i>Never stops talking.</i>

32:19.880 --> 32:22.156
<i>He's saying, "Come on, whitey,</i>
<i>let's see what you got."</i>

32:22.240 --> 32:24.516
<i>Couple of other choice words</i>
<i>I'd rather not mention.</i>

32:26.200 --> 32:27.236
<i>Let's not forget one thing,</i>

32:27.320 --> 32:30.552
<i>Ali does not dance like that for</i>
<i>seven or eight, nine rounds anymore.</i>

32:30.640 --> 32:31.790
<i>He puts on these displays.</i>

32:31.880 --> 32:34.111
<i>Wepner will look slow and awkward,</i>
<i>because he is slow and awkward,</i>

32:34.200 --> 32:36.795
<i>but he does deliver a pretty good blow.</i>

32:36.880 --> 32:39.759
<i>Finally, I get him on the ropes.</i>
<i>He's doing his rope-a-dope thing.</i>

32:39.840 --> 32:41.274
Bayonne, Chuck! Bayonne!

32:41.360 --> 32:42.714
<i>He doesn't give me much.</i>

32:42.800 --> 32:44.120
<i>You know, I take what I can get.</i>

32:44.200 --> 32:48.035
<i>Couple of kidney shots,</i>
<i>behind the head... You know, dirty.</i>

32:51.480 --> 32:53.437
<i>To the best of my knowledge,</i>
<i>that was Muhammad Ali</i>

32:53.520 --> 32:55.352
<i>that was unloading the illegal shots.</i>

32:55.440 --> 32:56.760
Shots to the head.

32:56.840 --> 33:00.038
<i>...if they do penalize him for it or not</i>
<i>is a big question.</i>

33:00.120 --> 33:03.352
<i>But certainly, Muhammad Ali</i>
<i>was no more the winner of that round</i>

33:03.440 --> 33:04.954
<i>than Chuck Wepner.</i>

33:10.960 --> 33:13.475
<i>Ali clearly has a much more fluid motion,</i>

33:13.560 --> 33:14.960
<i>much more ability.</i>

33:15.040 --> 33:16.997
<i>It's clear that he's getting through</i>
<i>with the jab...</i>

33:17.080 --> 33:18.594
Bring your guard up.

33:19.400 --> 33:20.675
<i>There's a quick combination.</i>

33:20.760 --> 33:22.991
<i>Another three, four punches</i>
<i>to the face of Wepner.</i>

33:23.080 --> 33:25.515
<i>But Wepner not visibly shaken,</i>
<i>as he continues to come in.</i>

33:25.600 --> 33:27.034
<i>This man does not back up.</i>

33:27.120 --> 33:29.396
<i>What good was backing up gonna do?</i>

33:29.480 --> 33:30.880
<i>Look, my thing was this.</i>

33:30.960 --> 33:33.520
<i>I couldn't hit him, so I figured</i>
<i>I'd wear him down with my face.</i>

33:33.600 --> 33:37.071
<i>It was working great for five</i>
<i>or six rounds until finally, boom.</i>

33:38.120 --> 33:41.079
<i>Now it looks like Wepner</i>
<i>may possibly have a cut above the eye.</i>

33:41.800 --> 33:43.996
<i>I think I see some red stuff</i>
<i>that might possibly be hair.</i>

33:44.240 --> 33:46.072
<i>No, Wepner is cut above the eye.</i>

33:46.160 --> 33:47.560
<i>Looks like a pretty good gash, too.</i>

33:47.640 --> 33:48.676
Come on!

33:48.760 --> 33:50.035
<i>Wepner holds his arm up and says,</i>

33:50.120 --> 33:51.839
<i>"Come on, Champ,</i>
<i>is that the best you can do?"</i>

33:51.920 --> 33:53.639
<i>Wepner's a tough kid.</i>
<i>There's no doubt about it.</i>

33:53.760 --> 33:56.116
<i>I have tremendous respect</i>
<i>for the courage of this man.</i>

33:56.200 --> 33:58.635
<i>Ali has no respect for his ability.</i>

34:00.040 --> 34:03.556
<i>All I know is they all said</i>
<i>I was gonna be done in three rounds,</i>

34:03.640 --> 34:05.233
<i>and now they're chanting my name.</i>

34:05.320 --> 34:09.199
<i>Sure, he was beating the crap out</i>
<i>of me, but they loved it. They loved me.</i>

34:09.280 --> 34:10.429
Hey, John!

34:10.520 --> 34:14.434
You hear that crowd, Chuck?
They love you, Chuck! They love you!

34:16.480 --> 34:18.039
- Hey!
- What?

34:18.159 --> 34:20.550
Look at me, you dumb fuck. Focus!

34:22.080 --> 34:25.391
<i>Wepner not concerned with the left jab</i>
<i>at all, he just takes the punch.</i>

34:25.480 --> 34:29.474
<i>Ali fakes the top part of his body back</i>
<i>and slips a punch to his left and...</i>

34:32.080 --> 34:36.074
<i>Vicious shot to the ribs</i>
<i>of Muhammad Ali, and what a surprise!</i>

34:36.159 --> 34:39.312
<i>Chuck Wepner gets to the body</i>
<i>of Muhammad Ali!</i>

34:40.280 --> 34:41.953
Chuck! Holy shit!

34:42.040 --> 34:45.875
<i>I was as shocked as anyone else.</i>
<i>I mean, my head was spinning.</i>

34:46.840 --> 34:49.560
<i>I knew I hit him hard,</i>
<i>but to see him on his ass like that...</i>

34:50.320 --> 34:53.916
<i>I saw myself as</i>
<i>the heavyweight champion of the world.</i>

34:54.000 --> 34:57.596
<i>Didn't last, though. He got back up.</i>
<i>Boy, was he pissed.</i>

34:57.680 --> 35:01.435
<i>Ali is now going to have to</i>
<i>get off his haunches and start the fight!</i>

35:01.520 --> 35:04.194
<i>This is no joke! Ali was surprised!</i>

35:05.560 --> 35:07.836
<i>Ali sat right down on his seat.</i>

35:07.920 --> 35:10.116
<i>Now watch Ali go to work.</i>

35:10.200 --> 35:13.671
<i>Ali is aggravated.</i>
<i>It looks like Wepner's in trouble now.</i>

35:23.520 --> 35:26.957
<i>By the 12th round, he'd already closed</i>
<i>both my eyes, broke my nose,</i>

35:27.040 --> 35:29.839
<i>and he was still dancing circles around me.</i>

35:29.920 --> 35:31.752
<i>I didn't care.</i>

35:31.840 --> 35:33.877
<i>I was just happy to be in the ring with him.</i>

35:35.400 --> 35:38.950
<i>I don't remember much after that,</i>
<i>except trying to stay on my feet.</i>

35:39.680 --> 35:43.799
<i>I could feel him hitting me.</i>
<i>No pain, just the thud of his fists.</i>

35:43.880 --> 35:44.870
<i>Bone on bone.</i>

35:45.480 --> 35:46.470
<i>Boom.</i>

35:47.480 --> 35:48.470
<i>Boom.</i>

35:49.360 --> 35:52.034
<i>Stay up, Chuck. Stay up.</i>

35:53.400 --> 35:57.314
<i>Round 15, the heavyweight</i>
<i>championship of the world!</i>

35:57.400 --> 35:59.596
<i>People are on their feet at the Coliseum.</i>

35:59.680 --> 36:01.000
<i>They are seeing a better fight</i>

36:01.080 --> 36:03.549
<i>than they thought that they were</i>
<i>going to see for their money.</i>

36:03.680 --> 36:06.115
<i>Mohammed Ali wants to knock this man out.</i>

36:06.200 --> 36:08.317
<i>Wepner does not want to go down.</i>

36:08.400 --> 36:11.040
<i>There's a good combination,</i>
<i>Wepner's ready to go.</i>

36:11.120 --> 36:15.637
<i>Ali comes on. Wepner is staggering,</i>
<i>he's out on his feet right now.</i>

36:15.720 --> 36:18.030
<i>Ali has his man in trouble!</i>

36:18.120 --> 36:20.589
<i>Wepner attempting to hang on viciously.</i>

36:20.680 --> 36:23.275
<i>He's trying to hang on. He's out on his feet!</i>

36:23.360 --> 36:24.919
<i>Ali clocks him!</i>

36:26.320 --> 36:30.280
<i>A right hand and a left hook</i>
<i>drops Chuck Wepner!</i>

36:32.080 --> 36:33.150
Get up! Get up!

36:33.240 --> 36:37.075
<i>Five. Six. Seven. Eight.</i>

36:37.160 --> 36:38.640
<i>The referee stops the fight!</i>

36:38.720 --> 36:41.713
<i>It'll be scored as a technical knockout!</i>

36:41.800 --> 36:46.113
<i>Muhammad Ali retains the heavyweight</i>
<i>championship of the world!</i>

38:12.280 --> 38:14.158
<i>Nineteen seconds.</i>

38:14.240 --> 38:16.755
<i>They stopped the fight with 19 seconds to go.</i>

38:16.880 --> 38:18.234
<i>I didn't make it.</i>

38:19.400 --> 38:23.440
<i>Funny thing is, nobody cared.</i>
<i>They threw me a party anyway.</i>

38:27.920 --> 38:30.230
AI says to me,
"Forget the bank, we need a fire hose

38:30.320 --> 38:32.118
"'cause Ali's getting up
and his ass is burnin'!"

38:34.760 --> 38:38.276
<i>And what a reception for you in Bayonne.</i>

38:38.360 --> 38:40.079
<i>Yeah, that was some party, huh?</i>

38:40.800 --> 38:44.316
<i>You think there'll be a rematch, Chuck?</i>
<i>You and Ali, one more time?</i>

38:44.400 --> 38:46.517
<i>Could be. Why not?</i>

38:46.600 --> 38:48.910
<i>You know, unless he's too scared of me now.</i>

38:49.520 --> 38:52.240
<i>In the meantime, Bob,</i>
<i>I'm just gonna enjoy myself.</i>

38:52.320 --> 38:53.640
Chuck, you look good.

38:53.720 --> 38:55.200
<i>And what do you do for enjoyment, Chuck?</i>

38:55.280 --> 38:56.999
<i>Wine, women, and song, Bob.</i>

38:57.080 --> 38:59.959
<i>Wine, women, and song.</i>
<i>Not necessarily in that order.</i>

39:00.040 --> 39:01.235
<i>Okay.</i>

39:01.320 --> 39:02.720
<i>Guess what I like first.</i>

39:02.800 --> 39:04.359
<i>I'll leave that for the folks at home.</i>

39:04.440 --> 39:06.352
<i>Getting back to the fight.</i>

39:06.440 --> 39:09.672
<i>This photograph</i>
<i>is of the knockdown in round nine.</i>

39:09.760 --> 39:10.750
Come on.

39:10.840 --> 39:14.231
<i>Now, Ali says that's your foot</i>
<i>stepping on his foot.</i>

39:14.320 --> 39:17.518
<i>And he said it threw him off-balance,</i>
<i>and that's why he went down.</i>

39:17.600 --> 39:18.829
Bullshit. Not even close.

39:18.960 --> 39:21.031
I step on your foot, you goin' down,
you protest, wouldn't you?

39:21.120 --> 39:23.635
Of course, that'd be the first thing
you do. You stand up and you say...

39:23.720 --> 39:26.030
Referee calls it a knockdown
and it's in the books. It's a knockdown.

39:26.120 --> 39:27.076
That's why there's a referee there.

39:27.160 --> 39:28.719
- Daddy.
- Yeah, honey.

39:28.800 --> 39:30.359
This guy's just trying to
make something, you know?

39:30.440 --> 39:31.590
Daddy.

39:32.520 --> 39:34.637
<i>- Ali knows what happened.</i>
- Oh, my God.

39:34.720 --> 39:36.393
- Is that supposed to be me?
- Yeah.

39:36.480 --> 39:37.994
Look at this.

39:38.080 --> 39:39.309
Who is that, Bigfoot?

39:39.400 --> 39:40.800
No, it's Daddy.

39:40.880 --> 39:42.473
That's my girl.

39:48.760 --> 39:50.353
I'll be right back.

39:52.200 --> 39:54.396
- What are you doing?
- Just leave me alone.

39:54.480 --> 39:56.392
Don't you wanna watch the show? It's still...

39:57.320 --> 40:00.199
- You kidding me, Chuck?
- What?

40:00.280 --> 40:03.910
What, "Wine, women, and song"? On television?

40:04.000 --> 40:08.199
You know, it's bad enough
what you do on the streets, but on TV!

40:08.280 --> 40:12.035
I said "woman," not women.
I said one woman. You.

40:12.120 --> 40:13.873
- Bullshit.
- Come on, Phyll.

40:14.120 --> 40:15.839
I'm just mouthing off.
You know what it's like.

40:16.040 --> 40:18.760
No, I don't know what it's like, Chuck.
And I don't care.

40:18.840 --> 40:21.400
It was a big night for me, all right?

40:21.520 --> 40:23.876
We're just having fun.
They were all, you know...

40:27.200 --> 40:31.160
They were eating it up, you know?
I was doing the Bayonne thing.

40:31.280 --> 40:32.430
They loved it.

40:32.760 --> 40:36.549
Yeah. Everybody loves you.

40:41.600 --> 40:44.115
<i>I didn't hear a freakin' word she said.</i>

40:44.200 --> 40:46.590
<i>Truth is, I was so high on cloud nine,</i>

40:46.680 --> 40:49.275
<i>I couldn't hear anything</i>
<i>but the sound of my own voice.</i>

40:49.360 --> 40:51.272
And I buy her this beautiful
powder blue negligee.

40:51.360 --> 40:54.110
And I says, "Honey, I want you to
wear this tonight, because tonight,

40:54.200 --> 40:57.159
"you're gonna be sleeping with
the heavyweight champion of the world."

40:57.240 --> 40:59.880
So, after the fight,
I come back to the hotel, I let myself in,

40:59.960 --> 41:03.032
she says to me, "So, do I go to
Ali's room, or does he come to mine?"

41:08.840 --> 41:10.479
How you doin' for Smirnoff?

41:10.560 --> 41:12.279
Good, Champ. I'll take whatever you got.

41:12.360 --> 41:13.635
People doing a lot of celebrating this week.

41:13.720 --> 41:14.836
That's what I like to hear.

41:14.920 --> 41:17.560
Hey, Red, do me a favor.
Give me a round for everybody on me.

41:17.640 --> 41:19.632
Wait your turn. I got customers.

41:19.720 --> 41:22.155
- Wait my turn?
- Easy, Chuck. Chuck, easy, easy, easy.

41:22.240 --> 41:24.357
That's Linda. You don't wanna mess with her.

41:24.440 --> 41:26.318
Linda! Linda, come here.

41:26.400 --> 41:27.800
Don't you know who this is?

41:27.920 --> 41:29.479
Yeah, the Bayonne Bleeder.

41:29.560 --> 41:30.676
How you doin'?

41:30.800 --> 41:33.315
Ali says you stepped on his foot,
that's why he went down.

41:33.400 --> 41:35.995
Yeah? He said that? Well, that's bullshit.

41:36.080 --> 41:39.118
That's what he said.
Dirty fighter. Called you a punk.

41:41.240 --> 41:43.960
Punk, huh? I ain't no punk.

41:44.040 --> 41:47.078
I was almost the heavyweight champion
of the world.

41:47.160 --> 41:49.516
Well, you're no Mountain Rivera.

41:49.600 --> 41:51.353
Wait a minute, you saw that movie?

41:51.440 --> 41:53.318
<i>Requiem for a Heavyweight?</i> Sure.

41:53.400 --> 41:54.516
Fuck me.

41:54.600 --> 41:56.319
Not in this lifetime.

41:56.720 --> 41:59.918
But now it's your turn.
So, what are you having?

42:02.760 --> 42:05.559
I'll have a vodka rocks, and
whatever these jim-jims are drinking.

42:05.640 --> 42:06.710
Sure.

42:06.800 --> 42:08.519
- Thanks, Champ.
- What'd you say her name was?

42:08.600 --> 42:09.795
Linda. Linda.

42:16.360 --> 42:17.999
Here you go. Sorry for the wait.

42:20.720 --> 42:22.712
Hey, Chuck. Show her that ring.

42:22.800 --> 42:24.439
- What?
- Show her that ring.

42:26.120 --> 42:29.557
I designed it. It's a metaphor.

42:29.640 --> 42:32.360
The black onyx represents Ali.
I'm the diamond.

42:32.440 --> 42:35.877
Yeah? If I was you, I'd find
the gumball machine you got it from

42:35.960 --> 42:37.110
and get my quarter back.

42:39.480 --> 42:40.880
Let me ask you something. What sign are you?

42:40.960 --> 42:43.236
- You're kidding, right?
- Dead serious.

42:43.320 --> 42:44.549
Pisces.

42:44.640 --> 42:47.394
- No shit! That's my sign!
- Like that's not a line.

42:47.480 --> 42:49.278
- I'm not lying to you.
- What's your birthday, big shot?

42:49.360 --> 42:51.955
February 26th. What?

42:52.720 --> 42:54.598
- That's my birthday.
- Shut up.

42:54.680 --> 42:56.911
- No, that's my birthday!
- Come on.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.150
Here, look at this.

43:02.600 --> 43:04.080
Linda Pandilano.

43:06.080 --> 43:08.231
Anybody ever tell you
you take a beautiful picture?

43:08.320 --> 43:09.800
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

43:09.880 --> 43:13.556
No, I'm serious.
Hey, I'm so in love right now, it hurts.

43:13.640 --> 43:15.154
What are you doing later on?
Let's get married.

43:15.360 --> 43:17.511
Sure. Let me call your wife.

43:21.200 --> 43:23.840
Look, Chuck, you don't know nothing about me.

43:23.920 --> 43:26.594
And I don't know nothing about you.
So, what are you doing?

43:49.040 --> 43:50.190
Put this one over here.

43:54.040 --> 43:56.714
That's pretty.
Chuck. Will you get it? I'm busy.

43:58.840 --> 44:01.309
Yeah. This one's so cute.

44:02.240 --> 44:04.709
Hello? Yeah, this is him.

44:05.760 --> 44:06.830
What?

44:07.400 --> 44:10.472
<i>About a year and a half after the fight,</i>
<i>I get a phone call.</i>

44:10.560 --> 44:12.677
<i>Guy says he's a producer in Hollywood.</i>

44:12.760 --> 44:17.118
<i>Says some guy named Stallone wrote a</i>
<i>screenplay inspired by me. I was like...</i>

44:17.240 --> 44:18.356
What?

44:38.880 --> 44:40.792
<i>That don't matter either, you know?</i>

44:42.040 --> 44:44.509
<i>So, I was thinkin'...</i>

44:44.600 --> 44:47.195
<i>It really don't matter if I lose this fight.</i>

44:48.360 --> 44:51.114
<i>It really don't matter</i>
<i>if this guy opens my head, either.</i>

44:53.520 --> 44:55.591
<i>'Cause all I wanna do is go the distance.</i>

44:57.440 --> 44:59.909
- Chuck?
- I know.

45:00.000 --> 45:03.038
<i>Nobody's ever gone the distance with Creed.</i>

45:03.120 --> 45:04.918
<i>And if I can go that distance,</i>

45:06.880 --> 45:09.793
<i>just hearing that bell ring,</i>
<i>you know, I'm still standing...</i>

45:17.200 --> 45:20.398
Chuck Wepner. You're Chuck Wepner, right?

45:20.480 --> 45:21.755
- Hey, how you doin'?
- It's nice to meet you.

45:21.840 --> 45:24.435
- Nice to meet you.
- It's Chuck Wepner, guys.

45:24.520 --> 45:25.840
The real Rocky!

45:27.320 --> 45:28.720
<i>You hear that?</i>

45:28.800 --> 45:31.315
<i>Chuck Wepner, the real Rocky.</i>

45:33.000 --> 45:34.559
<i>I told you you know me.</i>

45:34.640 --> 45:38.236
Thank you very much.
Bye, everybody. Come on. Let's go.

45:39.480 --> 45:43.076
<i>I felt like a movie star.</i>
<i>This guy, he really got me.</i>

45:43.160 --> 45:45.959
<i>The job as a debt collector,</i>
<i>running the steps,</i>

45:46.040 --> 45:48.760
<i>even the conversation I had</i>
<i>with my wife, for Christ sakes.</i>

45:48.840 --> 45:51.878
<i>That was me. I was Rocky.</i>

46:13.440 --> 46:16.512
<i>Ladies and gents,</i>
<i>look who just walked in here!</i>

46:16.680 --> 46:18.637
<i>It's the king himself!</i>

46:18.720 --> 46:21.599
<i>It's the guy who went 15 rounds</i>
<i>with Muhammad Ali!</i>

46:21.680 --> 46:24.400
<i>The real life Rocky Balboa!</i>

46:24.480 --> 46:27.951
<i>Come on, and the toughest</i>
<i>son of a bitch in the Garden State!</i>

46:28.040 --> 46:31.078
<i>Give it up for Chuck Wepner!</i>

46:35.360 --> 46:36.476
Thank you!

46:36.560 --> 46:39.280
Hey, there he is! Yeah!

46:39.400 --> 46:41.551
All right! All right!

46:55.600 --> 46:57.319
<i>How about that band?</i>

46:57.400 --> 46:58.914
<i>Hit movie, hit song.</i>

46:59.000 --> 47:00.320
<i>What can I say?</i>

47:00.400 --> 47:02.039
<i>I'm a lucky guy.</i>

47:26.600 --> 47:27.590
Having fun tonight?

47:29.240 --> 47:31.232
Go get a drink. How you doing?

47:33.120 --> 47:35.112
This will be right here.

47:36.040 --> 47:37.997
Hey, John, look at that.

47:39.280 --> 47:40.350
Yo, Champ!

47:40.440 --> 47:43.956
I gotta tell you,
that movie was fuckin' unbelievable.

47:44.040 --> 47:45.076
Thanks, pal. Appreciate it.

47:45.160 --> 47:47.356
- How many nominations you get?
- Ten.

47:47.440 --> 47:49.636
Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director...

47:49.760 --> 47:52.798
Holy shit! You must've made
a fuckin' fortune! Am I right?

47:52.880 --> 47:54.997
- I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
- Yeah.

47:55.080 --> 47:56.992
When Sly told me about <i>Rocky,</i>

47:57.080 --> 48:00.232
he offered me 70 G's or 1% of the box office.

48:00.320 --> 48:01.356
I took the 70 G's.

48:01.480 --> 48:03.312
What do I know about movies?
I'm from Bayonne, you know?

48:03.440 --> 48:04.874
Hey, a bird in the hand, am I right?

48:04.960 --> 48:08.397
Hey, bird in the hand is good as
a hand in the bush <i>. Capisce?</i>

48:08.480 --> 48:09.994
Double <i>capisce!</i>

48:11.360 --> 48:14.558
Hey, doll, set my man up
with whatever he wants! On me!

48:14.640 --> 48:16.313
- Right on. Thanks, Champ.
- All right.

48:16.400 --> 48:17.390
All right, pal.

48:17.480 --> 48:19.517
You got 70 grand for that?

48:20.120 --> 48:21.190
Shut up, John.

48:21.280 --> 48:23.237
You hear that? 70 G's.

48:23.320 --> 48:24.276
What?

48:24.360 --> 48:26.113
Chuck got 70 big ones for <i>Rocky!</i>

48:26.200 --> 48:28.078
John, John, would you
shut the fuck up, please?

48:28.160 --> 48:29.560
Seriously. You know what I mean?

48:29.640 --> 48:31.438
You're not my fuckin' agent, John.

48:31.520 --> 48:32.840
That's my business, you know that?

48:32.920 --> 48:34.513
I don't want my business on the street.

48:34.640 --> 48:36.120
You know, I apologize.

48:36.200 --> 48:38.715
- I... I didn't mean...
- All right, all right, all right. Stop.

48:38.800 --> 48:41.156
- I didn't mean it...
- Forget it. Forget it.

48:41.240 --> 48:43.072
Sweetheart, can I get
a vodka on the rocks, please?

48:45.320 --> 48:46.674
I'm sorry.

48:47.720 --> 48:50.076
Truth is, I didn't make a fuckin' dime
on that movie.

48:50.160 --> 48:51.116
Really?

48:51.240 --> 48:52.674
Not a dime.

48:52.760 --> 48:54.831
That's fucked up, Chuck. I'm sorry.

48:54.960 --> 48:56.394
- I know, but the guy asked me...
- Yeah.

48:56.480 --> 48:58.756
...you know, in front of the girls,
I didn't wanna look like a chump,

48:58.840 --> 48:59.956
so I had to say something.

49:00.080 --> 49:01.912
- You know, this stops with me. All right?
- Thank you.

49:02.040 --> 49:03.599
Loose lips sink ships.

49:03.680 --> 49:05.239
- You know me, I'm not a talker.
- Yeah, yeah.

49:05.320 --> 49:06.754
- I'm not gonna bring it up.
- Okay.

49:06.880 --> 49:08.758
- 70 grand, out of my mind.
- Thank you.

49:08.880 --> 49:10.758
- All right? I'm not bringing it up.
- Will you stop!

49:10.840 --> 49:13.230
Hey, Chuck! I got a friend in the bathroom

49:13.320 --> 49:15.789
that wants to make your acquaintance.

49:16.000 --> 49:18.117
You want me to meet somebody in the toilet?

49:19.080 --> 49:21.117
No, nobody wants to meet you in the toilet!

49:21.200 --> 49:23.510
I want you to do a bump with me.

49:23.600 --> 49:24.590
A what?

49:24.680 --> 49:26.478
A bump! Come on, come on, come on.
Let's go, let's go.

49:30.880 --> 49:32.758
What is... This is great, you know?

49:32.840 --> 49:34.035
This stuff's fuckin' great.

49:34.120 --> 49:35.759
Yeah. You've never done this shit before?

49:35.840 --> 49:37.240
John, you try this shit?

49:37.320 --> 49:39.471
No, but I definitely...
I think I should do it again, you know.

49:39.560 --> 49:42.029
Yeah, absolutely, definitely you should.

49:42.120 --> 49:44.589
Holy shit!
It's like it goes right through you.

49:44.680 --> 49:46.160
That's right.

49:46.240 --> 49:47.674
John, you gotta try this shit.

49:47.760 --> 49:49.479
- Fuck, yeah!
- Yeah!

49:50.240 --> 49:52.152
Hey. Wanna bump?

49:52.640 --> 49:54.836
- No? Wanna do a bump?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:54.920 --> 49:56.513
Half's for her.

49:56.600 --> 49:58.080
Here you go.

50:55.680 --> 50:57.034
Say goodbye, Chuck.

51:00.520 --> 51:01.954
Say goodbye.

51:04.200 --> 51:07.796
Bye. Where are you going?

51:07.880 --> 51:10.520
Nope, not me. You. You're going someplace.

51:11.080 --> 51:12.719
Now. Today.

51:14.320 --> 51:15.436
Fuck.

51:18.160 --> 51:19.992
What are you talking about?

51:20.080 --> 51:22.117
I don't want you in my house anymore.

51:22.480 --> 51:24.995
I don't want you near my kid.

51:25.080 --> 51:27.595
You stink, Chuck. Okay?

51:27.680 --> 51:29.637
You stink like leftover pussy.

51:30.800 --> 51:32.439
It's making me sick.

51:32.520 --> 51:34.591
- I'm taking Kimberly, and I'm going.
- What?

51:34.680 --> 51:37.070
And when I come back, you're gone. Okay?

51:37.160 --> 51:39.311
- Phyll, wait a minute.
- No.

51:39.400 --> 51:40.754
Now, hang on a second. Just...

51:40.840 --> 51:43.674
You're gone. That's all.

51:44.600 --> 51:46.831
Listen, Phyll, please. I...

51:47.880 --> 51:49.109
I...

51:50.280 --> 51:53.159
I can't even fuckin' think straight
right now. My head hurts so much.

51:54.280 --> 51:55.794
You wanna talk about hurt,

51:55.880 --> 51:58.634
you live five minutes in my shoes.
Then we can talk about hurt.

52:56.480 --> 52:58.392
What are you doin', AI?

52:59.680 --> 53:02.434
I got three words for you, bubala.

53:02.520 --> 53:04.113
Andre the Giant.

53:04.240 --> 53:06.516
What about him?

53:06.600 --> 53:08.831
You're gonna kick his freak show
keister, that's what about him.

53:08.920 --> 53:10.832
I just got off the horn with Vince McMahon.

53:10.920 --> 53:14.550
He's talking about doing a mixed match,
wrestling and boxing.

53:14.640 --> 53:16.518
- Wrestling?
- Yeah.

53:16.600 --> 53:18.671
What's the matter?
You can't get me a legit fight?

53:18.760 --> 53:21.798
Look, you wanna keep working,
you're gonna have to stay famous.

53:21.880 --> 53:24.270
And dancing around
with a giant in Shea Stadium,

53:24.360 --> 53:25.953
that's not gonna hurt anybody.

53:26.480 --> 53:29.393
Chuck Wepner, Garden State Goliath!

53:30.640 --> 53:31.869
Shea Stadium?

53:31.960 --> 53:32.916
Yeah.

53:33.000 --> 53:35.276
A crowd of 50,000 plus.

53:35.800 --> 53:37.120
Lucky day.

53:37.520 --> 53:38.874
Lucky man.

53:41.400 --> 53:42.390
Hey, AI?

53:42.480 --> 53:43.596
Yeah.

53:44.320 --> 53:45.436
Is it real?

53:45.520 --> 53:46.636
What?

53:47.480 --> 53:50.075
Wrestling, they fight for real?

53:52.200 --> 53:53.793
What's so funny?

53:53.880 --> 53:55.712
I don't fuckin' know.

53:56.160 --> 53:58.072
Andre the Giant?

54:03.960 --> 54:06.555
<i>I don't think Wepner's</i>
<i>gonna be able to get to him!</i>

54:06.680 --> 54:08.399
<i>Andre now has him!</i>

54:09.520 --> 54:11.591
<i>Hanging a right to the kidney now!</i>

54:11.680 --> 54:13.911
<i>Andre has him,</i>
<i>but doesn't know what to do with him!</i>

54:14.000 --> 54:15.753
He can't get out of a head lock.

54:15.840 --> 54:16.990
Linda!

54:20.800 --> 54:24.635
Tell him that'll cost a beer.

54:27.080 --> 54:30.915
<i>I think Andre showed a little mercy</i>
<i>by just kind of dumping him down.</i>

54:31.560 --> 54:34.280
<i>The 49th Annual Academy Awards.</i>

54:34.360 --> 54:36.636
<i>Live from the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.</i>

54:39.000 --> 54:41.071
<i>And the winner is</i>

54:41.160 --> 54:44.517
<i>John G. Avildsen for</i> Rocky.

54:46.640 --> 54:47.710
All right!

54:48.960 --> 54:50.519
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

54:52.920 --> 54:56.550
<i>I guess what</i> Rocky <i>did was</i>
<i>give a lot of people hope.</i>

54:56.640 --> 55:00.600
<i>And there was never a better feeling</i>
<i>than doing that.</i>

55:01.720 --> 55:03.552
<i>And the winner is</i>

55:04.560 --> 55:05.550
Rocky.

55:06.280 --> 55:10.399
<i>Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff, producers.</i>

55:11.400 --> 55:13.278
Yeah! What the...

55:13.360 --> 55:14.635
Holy...

55:38.520 --> 55:39.636
Chuck.

55:39.720 --> 55:41.677
Hey, Flo. How you doin'?

55:42.440 --> 55:44.750
Well, Chuck, come on in.

55:45.680 --> 55:46.955
- That's for you.
- Thank you.

55:47.040 --> 55:49.157
It's called a mother-in-law's tongue.
I thought that was funny.

55:49.280 --> 55:51.749
Don! It's your brother.

55:51.840 --> 55:52.990
It's Chuck.

55:53.120 --> 55:54.270
What?

55:54.360 --> 55:56.477
Your brother, you shit bird.

55:56.560 --> 55:57.676
What the fuck?

55:57.760 --> 55:58.750
Hey, Donny.

55:59.080 --> 56:00.480
What are you doin' here?

56:00.560 --> 56:01.676
What, no "hello"?

56:01.760 --> 56:03.035
Hello. What are you...

56:03.120 --> 56:05.510
- What's the matter? What's wrong?
- Nothing.

56:05.600 --> 56:07.034
Nothing's wrong. Everything's great.

56:07.120 --> 56:08.998
I got something in the kitchen. Excuse me.

56:09.080 --> 56:11.197
- You got some glasses, Flo, for...
- Yeah.

56:11.280 --> 56:12.600
Thanks.

56:16.640 --> 56:18.711
- You look good.
- What's going on?

56:19.480 --> 56:20.755
You don't know, do you?

56:21.520 --> 56:22.636
Don't know what?

56:24.160 --> 56:25.196
The awards!

56:25.280 --> 56:27.636
The fuckin' Academy Awards, you goon!

56:28.640 --> 56:30.711
I don't really watch that shit.

56:30.800 --> 56:31.916
You didn't see it?

56:32.000 --> 56:33.559
No, I didn't see anything.

56:34.640 --> 56:35.835
We won.

56:36.760 --> 56:37.955
Who won, you?

56:38.080 --> 56:40.072
Yeah, me <i>. Rocky. Rocky</i> won.

56:41.760 --> 56:42.830
So?

56:43.360 --> 56:44.794
What do you mean "so"?

56:44.920 --> 56:46.354
It's me. I'm him.

56:46.440 --> 56:49.035
- Who's you?
<i>- Rocky.</i> It's my life.

56:49.120 --> 56:51.316
Without me, there's no <i>Rocky,</i> Don.

56:52.000 --> 56:53.150
Okay.

56:53.840 --> 56:55.035
So?

56:58.440 --> 57:01.114
What's with the fuckin' "so," Don? I...

57:01.720 --> 57:03.632
So, never mind, you know.

57:05.160 --> 57:07.834
All right. You know, you don't get it.

57:09.960 --> 57:11.838
- I gotta go.
- All right, Chuck.

57:11.920 --> 57:13.240
- How's the kids?
- Kid.

57:13.320 --> 57:15.152
We got one kid.

57:15.240 --> 57:16.640
Yeah, I know. How is she?

57:16.720 --> 57:17.756
He.

57:18.840 --> 57:20.672
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

57:21.200 --> 57:23.112
It's like that, right?

57:24.040 --> 57:26.191
Chuck, what...
What the fuck are you doin' here?

57:27.160 --> 57:28.594
Why'd you come?

57:28.680 --> 57:30.512
I don't know.

57:30.600 --> 57:33.240
I just wanted to celebrate.
Thought I'd come say hi.

57:33.320 --> 57:34.595
The movie?

57:34.720 --> 57:36.473
Yeah. My life, you know?

57:37.040 --> 57:40.670
My lucky day on the big screen,
Academy Awards, Oscars, you know?

57:40.760 --> 57:43.753
It's nothin' to you.
It was a big fuckin' deal.

57:46.880 --> 57:48.519
Congratulations.

57:51.120 --> 57:52.349
Thanks.

57:57.280 --> 58:00.352
What's his name? The boy, your boy.

58:00.440 --> 58:02.272
What, you talking about your nephew? Danny?

58:02.360 --> 58:04.317
That's it. I... I knew that.

58:06.680 --> 58:08.478
Tell him I said hello.

58:08.560 --> 58:11.120
Tell him the champ was here and...

58:12.800 --> 58:13.995
You know.

58:15.720 --> 58:17.200
Chuck, you...

58:18.920 --> 58:19.990
What are you doing?

58:20.080 --> 58:22.470
You... You wanna stay for dinner?
You can stay for dinner.

58:22.600 --> 58:24.592
No, I can't. I got people.

58:24.680 --> 58:26.194
Some other time, though.

58:26.280 --> 58:27.873
See you, Donny.

58:54.200 --> 58:59.229
Hello. Yeah, hi. I'd like the number for
United Artists in Hollywood, please.

Hey, Mr. Stallone,
I'm sorry to bother you, but you know...

59:04.440 --> 59:06.033
Hey, Sly, my name's Chuck Wepner.

59:06.120 --> 59:07.918

59:11.360 --> 59:13.352
I just wanna say
I'm a big fan of all your movies.

59:13.440 --> 59:14.874
You know,

59:16.400 --> 59:17.993
<i>Rocky,</i> that was, you know...

59:18.200 --> 59:19.520
Yeah, hi, this is Chuck Wepner.

59:19.600 --> 59:22.559
I'd like to speak to
Sylvester Stallone, please.

59:23.200 --> 59:24.429
Wepner.

59:25.120 --> 59:27.840
W-E-P-N-E-R.

59:29.360 --> 59:32.273
Yeah. Yeah, I think he knows who I am.

59:34.320 --> 59:36.835
Listen, you ever heard of <i>Rocky?</i>

59:37.320 --> 59:38.800
Hello?

59:39.320 --> 59:40.470
Hello?

59:41.640 --> 59:43.154
Motherfucker.

59:43.640 --> 59:46.155
<i>It wasn't the money, I just wanted to</i>
<i>meet the guy, you know?</i>

59:46.240 --> 59:49.039
<i>It's like having a twin out there</i>
<i>in the world that you never met.</i>

59:49.120 --> 59:51.510
So, what did he talk about? Pussy?

59:51.600 --> 59:53.512
I bet that guy cleans up, huh?

59:53.600 --> 59:56.399
John, please. Sly's discreet.
That's how it is in Hollywood.

59:56.480 --> 59:57.914
- You don't talk about that stuff.
- Of course.

59:58.000 --> 59:58.956
Besides, guys who get it,

59:59.040 --> 01:00:00.269
- they don't talk about it.
- Yeah.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.760
Me and him, it's professional, you know?

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:04.560
We talk about the Ali fight, my strategy,
I give him tips.

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:05.756
You gave him tips?

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:07.115
You didn't hear that from me, all right?

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:08.520
- Yeah, but that's cool!
- I'm not supposed to

01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:09.590
talk about that, John.

01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:11.592
- All right, but what do they talk...
- Will you wait a second?

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:13.034
We go in here, can you just...

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:14.600
- Why are you nervous?
- Just...

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:15.670
I mean...

01:00:16.840 --> 01:00:18.911
<i>Stallone was an off-limit kind of guy,</i>

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.356
<i>but I had a friend worked in</i>
<i>the liquor business in New York.</i>

01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:22.920
<i>He knew where Sly was hanging out,</i>

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:25.435
<i>so we told the bartender</i>
<i>to give me a heads-up.</i>

01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:26.636
I appreciate that.

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.512
Sorry, sir,
we're closed for a private function.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.240
Yeah, I know.
How you doin'? I'm Chuck Wepner.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.112
How can I help you, Mr. Wepner?

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:40.520
You follow boxing?

01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:43.316
<i>Rocky?</i> Tell Sly, Chuck's here.

01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:45.471
- I can handle this.
- He should know.

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.916
Would you mind telling Mr. Stallone that

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:50.879
Chuck Wepner's here?

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.673
Is he expecting you?

01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:56.750
What?

01:00:56.880 --> 01:00:58.599

Yeah. Yeah, he's expecting us.

01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:04.798
Hang on just a minute.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:14.670
Is that him?

01:01:14.760 --> 01:01:15.955
Put your fuckin' hand down.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.030
Yeah. No shit.

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:19.840
Oh, my God!

01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:21.434

Do me a favor.
Just hang back here a minute, okay?

01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:27.439
- What? Why?
- Give me a moment alone

01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:28.670
with Stallone, all right?

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.116
Tough guy. Tough motherfucker. Yeah.

<i>He even gave me a script for</i>
<i>the new</i> Rocky <i>movie he was making.</i>

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:59.997
Ching Weber, get it? Ching Weber,
Chuck Wepner? It's good, right?

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:02.037
Hollywood doesn't do a sequel
unless it's a sure thing.

01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.032
This is a sure thing. Like chicken vindaloo.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.919
Ching says, "Couldn't you think of
anything tougher to say

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.559
"than, 'Oops, no stones'?"

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:11.360
I mean, come on,
how fuckin' good is that? Right?

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:12.669
- It's pretty great.
- You know?

01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:14.274
You thought the Ali fight was big.

01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:17.990
Ali's small potatoes compared to this.
They should call it <i>Wepner 2.</i>

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:20.396
What are they gonna do about your face?

01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:25.515
It's like I been training for this
my whole life.

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:29.116
Going toe-to-toe with Sylvester Stallone
on the silver screen.

01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:30.873
Notify the other planets, John.

01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:32.758
A star is born.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:34.559
In fuckin' Bayonne.

01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:38.036
Right? Give me another one of these?

01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:43.712
That's it right there.

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:44.870
<i>Rocky ll.</i>

01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:47.995
I never seen one of these.

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:50.549
Not many people have. Very hush-hush.

01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:52.313
It's called a screenplay.

01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:53.880
- Well, how'd you get it?
- Yeah.

01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:56.395
What do you mean, how did I get it?
I'm in it.

01:02:56.480 --> 01:02:59.473
Sly wants me to go down to Philly
tomorrow, meet with the producers.

01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:01.199
Wrote me a part.

01:03:01.840 --> 01:03:03.718
- You wanna run some lines?
- What?

01:03:03.840 --> 01:03:05.797
It's what they do, they run lines.

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:08.111
All right, let's run some fuckin' lines.

01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:11.193
Here we go. Hey...

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:13.320
Those lines.

01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:33.557
"You know, in 1952,
they had me ranked number five.

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:38.394
"I'm not... I'm not kidding you.
They... They ranked me number five.

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:42.630
"Marciano, Walcott, and Charles
are still around.

01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:45.076
"But they had me up there
ranked number five."

01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:47.879
Watch. This is good.

01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:53.397
"Miss, I got no special problem.

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:58.035
"I tell you what, I'm a big, ugly slob.
I look like a freak.

01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:00.840
"But I was almost
the heavyweight champion of the world.

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:04.638
"Why don't you put that down
on that paper someplace?

01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:07.110
"Mountain Rivera was no punk.

01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:11.640
"Mountain Rivera was almost
the heavyweight champion of the world."

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:13.954
Oh, my God.

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:15.474
That was good.

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:17.553
Seriously, that was really good.

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:18.994
Thank you.

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:22.159
You are ready for your close-up, Mr. Deville.

01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:24.709
I got a lump in my throat, I swear.

01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:27.115
For my second act,

01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:29.635
I'd like to do my impression of Sonny Liston

01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.991
in his last fight with Muhammad Ali.

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:33.920
Taking a dive.

01:04:42.440 --> 01:04:45.194
We gotta finish it.
We gotta finish all of it!

01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.399
Come on, come on, come on!

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:03.075
Chuck, hey, hey. You're supposed to be late.

01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.719
It's show business.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:05.916
All right.

01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:10.590
Where's the button?

01:05:10.680 --> 01:05:11.716
- Where's the button?
- I'll get it.

01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:12.756
Where's the fuckin' button?

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:14.320
There's gotta be...

01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:17.160
Get your boobs out of the way.

01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:18.909
Mr. Wepner.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.275
Hey, how you doin'?

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:22.920
- Right this way. They're waiting for you.
- She knows you. You're in.

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:24.992
- This is like a no-brainer.
- Give me one of them Tic Tacs?

01:05:26.200 --> 01:05:28.192
I gotta be fuckin' crazy.

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.751
I need your friends to wait here.

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:32.911
- Wait. They can't come with me?
- Follow me.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:34.434
Excuse me. Miss?

01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:36.273
Miss, they came all the way
from Jersey to meet Sly.

01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:38.352
- You don't think...
- Come on.

01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:40.757
Hey, you wanna run lines?

01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:46.160
Hey, there he is.

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:48.550
Hey, how are you, Chuck?

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.199
Hey, Sly. How's it goin'?

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.192
I'm good. Hey. You good?

01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:53.953
- Yeah, I'm great.
- All right.

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:55.269
Thanks for making the trip down here.

01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:57.556
- Hey, I was in the neighborhood?
- What?

01:05:57.680 --> 01:05:58.796
- Nothing.
- Yeah.

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.633
Everybody, this is Chuck Wepner.

01:06:00.880 --> 01:06:02.109
The real deal.

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:04.192
How you doin', everybody?

01:06:04.480 --> 01:06:06.233
Boy, that's some spread you got there.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:09.117
Bagels and lox,
that's what I'm talking about.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.993
- Hey, so, let's do this?
- What?

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:14.880
You ready to read, Champ?

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:17.239
Shit, yeah. Hey.

01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:19.312
- I was born ready, you know?
- Great.

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:21.153
- Hey, all right, Chuck. Okay.
- It's what I do.

01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:23.072
You stand right about there, all right?

01:06:23.160 --> 01:06:24.799
All right, now, in this scene,

01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:26.951
- Rocky and Ching are sparring, right?
- Yeah.

01:06:27.040 --> 01:06:28.633
Mickey, your old trainer,
is watching ringside,

01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:30.916
and you are jealous
because you feel that, really,

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.992
it should be you getting the title shot.

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:34.594
It's a bitter pill, you know?

01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:37.149
There's somebody else
getting what's rightfully yours.

01:06:37.240 --> 01:06:38.515
Try and feel that.

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:42.236
Hey, I ain't gotta try to feel that, Sly.
It's, you know, it's me.

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:44.516
Yeah, that's right. That's perfect.
That's beautiful. All right.

01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:48.440
So, I'll do Rocky,
and Charlotte's gonna read Mickey.

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:49.715
- All right.
- Ready?

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:51.120
Yeah. So, we're just...
We're just moving, right?

01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:52.236
- We're just working.
- We're just sparring.

01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:53.350
- We're in the gym, yeah.
- All right.

01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:54.430
All right, ready?

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:56.556
Hey!

01:06:56.640 --> 01:06:58.120
Hey, come on!

01:06:58.520 --> 01:06:59.954
Hey, what was that?

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:01.633
We're supposed to be working here.

01:07:01.720 --> 01:07:03.916
- I'm sorry, Sly.
- No problem. Take your time.

01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:06.960
"You're a bum.

01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:12.197
"I can lick you and any other guy
in this gym! One day..."

01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:16.189
Yeah, but we're just working.

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.158
I'm getting in shape for the title fight.

01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:21.074
Listen, you're being paid to spar with him.

01:07:21.160 --> 01:07:22.913
Just do your job.

01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.955
- Shit, I'm sorry. Sorry. This line...
- Nah, it's all right. Look. Look.

01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:29.679
- Chuck, just relax. This is you.
- I'm sorry.

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:30.989
This is you. You got it. Just do you.

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:32.550
Just be yourself.

01:07:32.640 --> 01:07:34.791
Let's start over. Let's do it again.

01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:36.714
Yeah. All right.

01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:37.870
Ready? Yeah, okay.

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:39.917
- We're movin'. Come on.
- Yeah.

01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.275
Just be loose.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.275
Hey!

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:45.238
Hey, come on, what was that?

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:46.515
We're supposed to be working here.

01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:48.674
You're a bum!

01:07:49.160 --> 01:07:52.119
I can lick you and any other guy in this gym!

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:53.954
And one day...

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:57.677
Yeah, but we're just workin'.

01:07:58.160 --> 01:07:59.753
I'm getting in shape for the title fight.

01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:02.753
Listen. You're being paid to spar with him.

01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:04.433
Just do your job.

01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:07.038
What's goin' on?

01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:12.912
I mean, he's supposed to be
my sparring partner!

01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:16.636
Thank you.

01:08:18.800 --> 01:08:20.359
- We all right, Sly?
- Hey, look, come here.

01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.395
Come here.

01:08:22.479 --> 01:08:23.675
Did I do something wrong?

01:08:23.760 --> 01:08:25.796
No, no, no. You didn't do anything wrong.

01:08:25.880 --> 01:08:27.279
Now listen.

01:08:27.359 --> 01:08:28.760
I want you in this movie.

01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:32.352
Go in the bathroom, take a minute,
study the script, kick it around,

01:08:32.439 --> 01:08:34.875
then come back, try it again.

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:36.679
You got this, all right?

01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:38.393
All you gotta do is you.

01:08:38.880 --> 01:08:41.270
- Okay, Champ?
- Yeah. All right.

01:08:41.359 --> 01:08:43.352
- All right.
- Thanks, Sly.

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.110
Chuck.

01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:34.596
Yeah.

01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:37.310
Hi.

01:10:42.120 --> 01:10:43.395
Sure.

01:10:44.760 --> 01:10:48.117
Two ounces? Gee, that's some party
you're throwing there?

01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:51.835
All right. I'll call my guy.

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:53.877
Yeah. Okay.

01:10:54.320 --> 01:10:57.358
I'll see you at the Silhouette at 8:00.
All right, bye.

01:10:57.480 --> 01:10:58.994
Was that Devon?

01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:02.797
- Is that his name?
- Yeah, that's his name.

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:05.440
Devon. Wants two ounces.

01:11:05.920 --> 01:11:07.957
Two ounces? Geez.

01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:10.359
He say where he was going?

01:11:11.640 --> 01:11:13.393
You got a fuckin' one-track mind.

01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:22.710
Hello.

01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:24.672
<i>- Hey, it's Phyllis.</i>
- Hey, Phyllis.

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:26.951
<i>- Where's Chuck? Is he with you?</i>
- Yeah.

01:11:27.040 --> 01:11:28.872
<i>Well, he's supposed to be at school</i>
<i>with his daughter.</i>

01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:31.520
Right now? You sure? Chuck!

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:34.600
Chuck, it's Phyllis.

01:11:34.680 --> 01:11:38.640
She says you were supposed to be
at some kid's thing? At school?

01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:48.312
- Hey, Phyll.
<i>- It's Parents' Day.</i>

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.198
- Yeah.
<i>- What? You forgot again?</i>

01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:51.999
No, I know. I didn't forget.

01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:53.315
<i>Are you coming?</i>

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:55.915
- Yeah. All right, relax. Relax.
<i>- She wants to see you right now.</i>

01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:58.600
I'm coming right now. All right. Bye.

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:03.717
You're going to school now?

01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:07.274
Chuck, seriously, you don't look so good.

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:09.234
You wanna do a bump?

01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:12.270
Yeah.

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:35.955
I'm here.

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:38.398
Here I am. I'm sorry.

01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:40.439
Hey! Here's my little girl.

01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:41.670
Hi, Daddy.

01:12:41.760 --> 01:12:43.035
How's she doin'?

01:12:43.120 --> 01:12:44.270
Smart as a whip?

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.829
Takes after her mother, thank God.

01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:48.270
Where's my manners? I'm sorry.

01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:49.635
I'm Chuck, Kimberly's dad.

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.314
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Wepner.

01:12:51.440 --> 01:12:52.510
Yeah. Nice to meet you.

01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.717
You can call me Chuck or Champ.

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:56.029
You follow boxing?

01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:57.916
No, I don't.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:12:58.990
No?

01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:00.070
You see <i>Rocky?</i>

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:01.514
- Chuck.
- What?

01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:03.789
Is that the report card?

01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:05.875
All right. Look at this.

01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:07.679
It's upside down, Daddy.

01:13:08.160 --> 01:13:09.640
She doesn't miss a beat, this one.

01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:11.916
- I'm so sorry. It's...
- Hey, you don't have to apologize.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.753
- I made a mistake.
- Chuck, stop it.

01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:14.990
It's a mistake. For...

01:13:15.080 --> 01:13:16.480
- Stop it.
- Okay.

01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:19.391
So, what are we doin' here?

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:21.831
Actually, I was just saying that

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:24.515
she's one of my brightest students in class.

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:26.319
- Of course.
- She's been doing really great.

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:28.995
- Very proud of her. Yeah.
- Good. Good.

01:13:29.320 --> 01:13:30.993
Hey. Hey, I wanna show you something.

01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:33.233
I... I wrote you a poem.

01:13:33.320 --> 01:13:34.674
You're gonna like this.

01:13:34.760 --> 01:13:36.877
It's... It's called "My Little Girl."
That's the title.

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:39.236
I wrote it 'cause I miss you.
Miss you so much, it hurts.

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:40.913
Look at this.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.231
"You are big now, not so small

01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:44.914
"But still my baby, after all

01:13:45.040 --> 01:13:46.156
"From time to time, as you grew..."

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:48.038
Let's go, baby. Come on. I'm so sorry.

01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:50.157
What? Come on, honey.
I'm just a few minutes late. What's...

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:51.356
Let her go, Chuck.

01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.319
Come on, Phyll!

01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:56.592
I'm sorry! I had...

01:13:58.200 --> 01:13:59.759
- Stay away from me.
- Will you stop, please,

01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:01.320
just two minutes?

01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:02.629
- Kim...
- No, don't you fuckin' move!

01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:03.710
All right. All right.

01:14:03.800 --> 01:14:05.439
You can do whatever you want
with your own life, Chuck,

01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:07.034
but I will not let you ruin hers.

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:08.759
- I'm sorry, okay?
- I am scared for you!

01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:10.553
I am scared for what's gonna happen to you!

01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:11.835
Nothing's gonna happen.

01:14:11.920 --> 01:14:13.877
I... I'm just a little
fucked up right now, okay?

01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:15.155
I'm gonna pray for you, Chuck.

01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:17.197
I haven't said a prayer since grammar school,

01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:18.999
but I'm gonna pray that you find the strength

01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:20.275
to be a father to your daughter!

01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:24.320
Hey, Kim, honey.

01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.471
I'm gonna call you, all right? All right?

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:27.676
Roll the window down.

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:29.513
Hey, Kimberly, roll the window down!

01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:32.752
Your poem! Honey, roll...

01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:32.278
- Jesus Christ.
- Chuck!

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:34.560
How you doin'?

01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:35.910
It's you!

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.514
Last I checked.

01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:39.398
The one that got away.

01:15:39.480 --> 01:15:41.949
Don't flatter yourself.

01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:43.838
You never had me.

01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:44.990
I know your reputation.

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:47.675
You got a line of 23-year-old cupcakes
down at the shore.

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:50.673
And if you're tryin' to sell me somethin',
I got all the liquor I need.

01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:52.353
I'm not tryin' to sell you nothin'.

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:54.636
What are you doin' here then?

01:15:55.200 --> 01:15:57.635
I gotta meet a guy about somethin'.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.040
Bad day?

01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:08.438
Worst fuckin' day in my life.

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:10.989
I oughta be strung up by my balls
and horsewhipped.

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:13.960
I fucked up.

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:15.520
What'd you do?

01:16:24.160 --> 01:16:28.200
I went to my little...
My little girl's school, you know,

01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:30.954
for one of them parent-teacher things?

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:35.594
You know, I... I ain't seen her in a while,
so, you know, I wrote her...

01:16:44.200 --> 01:16:45.316
Chuck.

01:16:49.720 --> 01:16:51.120
I'm sorry.

01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:56.640
You all right?

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:13.994
What are the odds of me runnin' into you?

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:16.720
It's the worst fuckin' day in my life,

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:19.711
and there you are,
like some angel out of the blue.

01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:31.195
If that ain't a sign,
I don't know what, Linda.

01:17:33.400 --> 01:17:34.390
You and me.

01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:38.075
We're connected. You don't see that?

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:39.635
I tell you what.

01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:43.831
There's more to you
than meets the eye, Chuck Wepner.

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:46.715
Not much, just enough.

01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:51.790
You wanna know what I think?

01:17:51.880 --> 01:17:52.950
What?

01:17:55.480 --> 01:17:57.233
I think you like me.

01:17:57.960 --> 01:17:59.679
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:01.917
Well, you've been hit in the head
a few times.

01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:05.758
Yeah, that's true.

01:18:10.880 --> 01:18:11.916
Shit.

01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:13.679
Don't move. Please.

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:15.319
Don't go nowhere, all right? I...

01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:19.155
Stay right where you are.
I gotta... Gotta go talk to somebody.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:28.992
- Hey, Devon.
- Hey, Champ.

01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:30.356
Everything good?

01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:31.476
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:18:31.600 --> 01:18:33.034
There you go.

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:34.790
Sorry, Champ.

01:18:40.120 --> 01:18:41.110
Hey, Jimmy.

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:42.600
Hey, Chuck.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:11.198
<i>When it rains, it pours, right?</i>
<i>It was a setup.</i>

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.476
<i>They said they'd let me go</i>
<i>if I gave 'em a name.</i>

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:15.557
It's two ounces, Chuck.

01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:18.310
We're talking serious time here.

01:19:19.600 --> 01:19:22.832
<i>Just didn't seem right, someone else</i>
<i>paying for my stupid mistake.</i>

01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:27.000
Okay, Champ.

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:29.434
One call.

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:31.840
Pick a winner.

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:40.110
Hello?

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:41.430
Hey.

01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:42.750
Chuck.

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:43.950
How's it goin'?

01:19:44.040 --> 01:19:45.520
Where are you?

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:49.712
Over here on 38th, at the police station.

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:50.796
Chuck.

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:52.599
You're my call.

01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:55.752
I got one call, I called you.

01:19:55.840 --> 01:20:00.600
What, you don't have a lawyer or someone
who helps you with things like this?

01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:02.993
Not at the moment.

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:05.632
You need to make bail.

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:09.760
It doesn't matter.
You know, I'm going to prison anyway.

01:20:09.840 --> 01:20:12.958
At least this way,
I get to talk to you, you know?

01:20:13.040 --> 01:20:14.872
What about family?

01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:19.756
I... I had a brother,
but he didn't give a fuck about me.

01:20:21.920 --> 01:20:26.597
Linda, I know you don't see it,
but we're connected.

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.958
You're crazy, you know that?

01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:32.509
Come on, same birthday.

01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:37.319
Fats Domino. Jackie Gleason. William Frawley.

01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:39.119
All February 26th.

01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:40.998
Who's William Frawley?

01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:42.673
What do you mean, "Who's William Frawley"?

01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:44.752
He's Fred from <i>I Love Lucy.</i>

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.354
That's special, Chuck.

01:20:46.440 --> 01:20:48.636
Three fat guys and a club fighter.

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:50.518
You talkin' about "club fighter"?

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:52.956
Hey, I'm Rocky Balboa.

01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:56.280
You never heard of the Bayonne Bleeder?

01:21:01.040 --> 01:21:02.520
Listen, Chuck.

01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:04.193
I can't do this.

01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:05.760
I gotta go.

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:07.280
I'm sorry.

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:29.033
Let's go, Champ.

01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:32.757
Looks like you made bail.

01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:35.870
What?

01:21:35.960 --> 01:21:37.997
Yep. You still got a fan out there.

01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:46.390
Don.

01:21:46.480 --> 01:21:48.631
Get in the fuckin' car, Chuck.

01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:03.831
Possession with intent to sell?

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:05.115
What, are you stupid?

01:22:05.200 --> 01:22:06.554
I was doin' a guy a favor.

01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:07.915
Yeah?

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:10.231
This is why you bailed
on Phyllis and Kimberly?

01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:11.714
To become some drug mule?

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:14.031
You know I had to mortgage my house
to bail you out?

01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:15.989
What'd you do that for?

01:22:16.480 --> 01:22:17.550
What?

01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:19.672
I'm sorry. I appreciate it.

01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:22.036
No, you don't appreciate shit!

01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:25.158
You never have, you never will, right, Champ?

01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:26.230
Hi, Flo.

01:22:26.320 --> 01:22:27.310
Hi, Chuck.

01:22:28.480 --> 01:22:30.472
Yeah, Champ. Get in the car!

01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:32.119
Fuckin' champ!

01:22:39.920 --> 01:22:41.957
Just don't think I'm doing this
because I like you,

01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:44.271
because I don't, you selfish prick.

01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:47.519
I'm doing this because our mother,
may she rest in peace,

01:22:47.600 --> 01:22:50.957
made me promise on her
goddamn deathbed to take care of you.

01:22:51.040 --> 01:22:52.315
You know why?

01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:53.993
'Cause she knew you're a fuck-up!

01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:56.074
Your own mother!

01:22:56.200 --> 01:22:58.635
With your fancy clothes,
and that bullshit with your whores

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:00.234
and now drugs?

01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:02.756
You ain't foolin' anyone, Chuck!
You know that, right?

01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:08.194
- You're right. I'm a fuck-up.
- You're lucky she called, instead of you.

01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:09.634
I would have fuckin' hung up on you!

01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:11.154
All right, I get it.

01:23:11.240 --> 01:23:12.276
I'm sorry.

01:23:12.360 --> 01:23:13.635
He cares about you, Chuck.

01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:14.915
Don't say anything to him!

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.354
Do not coddle him!

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:19.720
I appreciate the coconuts, Don.

01:23:19.800 --> 01:23:20.950
Hey, yeah, right.

01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:22.360
I'm still waiting for a "thank you" note.

01:23:25.240 --> 01:23:27.072
He still follows your career, you know?

01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:29.114
He always has.

01:23:29.200 --> 01:23:31.396
He's got a fuckin' scrapbook
with every magazine article.

01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:34.757
Every mention in the paper,
no matter how small.

01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:39.554
You know he made us go to
the Ali fight, right?

01:23:40.160 --> 01:23:42.038
He was so proud of you.

01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:45.516
Every time you threw a punch,
he jumped three feet in the air,

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:48.957
telling anybody who would listen
that was his brother.

01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.953
I didn't know.

01:23:53.920 --> 01:23:55.832
I don't know what to say, Don.

01:23:55.920 --> 01:23:58.958
Learn to not say something
every now and then.

01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:02.351
Maybe you'll live longer.

01:24:26.800 --> 01:24:28.154
I got plans, you know? I mean...

01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:30.038
I got some things going on.

01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:32.316
What do you got going on, Chuck?

01:24:33.120 --> 01:24:34.952
You got people who love you, Chuck.

01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:38.238
Real people. Not 'cause you fight,
not 'cause you're famous,

01:24:38.320 --> 01:24:40.960
not 'cause you show 'em a good time,
just because.

01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:42.554
It's that simple.

01:24:42.680 --> 01:24:45.434
The only thing they want from you is you.

01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:46.954
<i>That was a real low point for me</i>

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:49.236
<i>when Linda told me</i>
<i>she didn't wanna see me anymore.</i>

01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:50.993
Take care of yourself, Chuck.

01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:53.276
<i>I stopped thinkin' about the future,</i>

01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:55.710
<i>but she was right. The hell was I thinkin'?</i>

01:24:56.880 --> 01:24:58.712
<i>Why would she wanna have</i>
<i>anything to do with me?</i>

01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:00.872
<i>I mean, I was going to prison,</i>
<i>for Christ sake.</i>

01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:05.430
<i>To tell you the truth,</i>
<i>that's exactly where I belonged.</i>

01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:13.509
Chuck!

01:25:14.080 --> 01:25:15.594
Hey, Champ!

01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:17.114
Chuck fuckin' Wepner.

01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:18.236
The champ.

01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:20.551
- Big fan, Wepner.
- What's up, Chuck?

01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:21.915
Good to see you, Champ.

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:28.155
<i>I guess it took bein' thrown</i>
<i>in a box by myself</i>

01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:31.278
<i>for me to realize</i>
<i>what a selfish prick I'd been.</i>

01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:37.632
<i>It wasn't all bad, though.</i>

01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:40.394
<i>I stayed in shape. Got to read a lot.</i>

01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:42.711
<i>Life went on, inside and out.</i>

01:25:48.240 --> 01:25:50.550
<i>Phyllis and me called it quits,</i>
<i>made it official.</i>

01:25:51.080 --> 01:25:52.355
<i>No hard feelings.</i>

01:25:52.440 --> 01:25:55.911
<i>To be honest,</i>
<i>I was surprised she didn't do it sooner.</i>

01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:58.435
All good.

01:26:05.280 --> 01:26:06.919
Hey, Champ.

01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.400
How are you?

01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:10.358
All right, Warden. What's goin' on?

01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:11.874
Well, someone wants to see you.

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:13.754
Yeah? Who?

01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:15.835
You'll find out.

01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.559
Where we goin'?

01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:35.036
<i>Then, one day, one fuckin' day,</i>

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:37.430
<i>all the pieces started to come together.</i>

01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:44.432
You're shittin' me.

01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:46.958
It's called <i>Lock Up.</i>

01:26:49.680 --> 01:26:51.399
Rocky goes to jail.

01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:54.794
<i>Why the hell was I trying so hard</i>
<i>to be this guy?</i>

01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:57.197
<i>He's a character in a movie.</i>

01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:00.398
Come on. I'll take you over.
You can say hello.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.798
No, I don't think so.

01:27:04.040 --> 01:27:06.874
He knows you're here. He wants to see you.

01:27:08.600 --> 01:27:09.829
I'm good.

01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:14.998
<i>Linda was right,</i>
<i>I had people who loved me, real people.</i>

01:27:15.080 --> 01:27:17.549
<i>My brother, Phyllis,</i>
<i>my little girl, Kimberly.</i>

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:19.120
<i>I started writing Kimberly letters,</i>

01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:21.556
<i>telling her how much I missed her</i>
<i>and how sorry I was.</i>

01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:22.756
<i>It was nice.</i>

01:27:22.880 --> 01:27:24.599
<i>Things got better between us.</i>

01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:28.151
<i>I wrote to Linda, too,</i>
<i>but she never wrote me back.</i>

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:41.552
<i>In the end, I did 26 months</i>
<i>down from five years for good behavior.</i>

01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:43.677
<i>Could've been worse.</i>

01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:47.114
<i>But, hey, listen,</i>
<i>miracles don't happen overnight.</i>

01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:49.914
<i>You don't climb out of a shithole</i>
<i>and suddenly sprout wings,</i>

01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:51.673
<i>like in some movie.</i>

01:27:51.760 --> 01:27:53.592
<i>I still had to make a living.</i>

01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:56.798
<i>My old friend Arty Stock</i>
<i>had this charity event for a good cause.</i>

01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:57.870
To legends.

01:27:58.000 --> 01:27:59.434
<i>Make a few bucks.</i>

01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:01.034
<i>So, I did it.</i>

01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:06.840
What am I supposed to do?

01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:08.274
Hit it!

01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:20.117
Get up...

01:28:24.280 --> 01:28:25.714
<i>And now, watch this.</i>

01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:27.792
<i>This part really is like a movie,</i>

01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:30.714
<i>because out of this embarrassing,</i>
<i>humiliating, disgraceful,</i>

01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:35.317
<i>and completely mortifying clown show</i>
<i>that I once again got myself into,</i>

01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:38.154
<i>out of this, all of a sudden...</i>

01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:39.799
Hey, Champ.

01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:42.035
Jesus.

01:28:45.240 --> 01:28:46.390
What are you doin' here?

01:28:47.240 --> 01:28:49.880
Saturday night. I got nothing better to do.

01:28:49.960 --> 01:28:53.431
Thought I'd come out and see you
get mangled by a bear.

01:28:54.080 --> 01:28:55.833
It's not just any bear, it's Victor the Bear.

01:28:55.920 --> 01:28:57.957
- He's in a movie with Clint Eastwood.
- Good for him.

01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:00.077
- Cover of <i>Sports Illustrated.</i>
- Amazing.

01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:02.117
- Undefeated.
- Including tonight.

01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:09.672
My point is he's famous, Linda.

01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:12.594
Yeah, and look where it got him.

01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:16.917
I'm sorry. I didn't come here
to break your balls.

01:29:23.360 --> 01:29:24.589
So?

01:29:26.840 --> 01:29:28.832
I heard you got divorced.

01:29:32.760 --> 01:29:33.876
Yeah?

01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:34.996
Yeah.

01:29:37.320 --> 01:29:38.470
Where'd you hear that?

01:29:39.440 --> 01:29:41.079
Got your letters.

01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:47.679
Got my letters?

01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:50.956
And you couldn't even write me back?

01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:52.872
Timing's everything.

01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:11.635
Yeah?

01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:13.594
A little bit.

01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:18.118
It's just beautiful.

01:30:24.360 --> 01:30:25.430
Jesus, God.

01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:30.512
Okay, can we go home now?

01:30:31.160 --> 01:30:33.277
What you talkin' about?
I wanna take a picture.

01:30:33.360 --> 01:30:35.636
- You're kiddin'. I'm gonna throw up.
- Stop.

01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:39.390
Come on. Don't cut my head off.

01:30:39.480 --> 01:30:41.153
I'd be doin' you a favor.

01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:46.631
Look at you, like he's your girlfriend.

01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:47.790
Come on, just push the button.

01:30:51.360 --> 01:30:54.080
Seriously, Chuck, what'd it get you?

01:30:54.160 --> 01:30:55.435
It got me you.

01:30:55.520 --> 01:30:56.476
Lucky man.

01:30:56.560 --> 01:30:57.914
Let me see that.

01:30:58.720 --> 01:30:59.756
Come on.

01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:02.719
That is one handsome son of a bitch there.

01:31:03.040 --> 01:31:05.271
You don't look so bad, either.

01:31:06.920 --> 01:31:09.913
- You know what I'm gonna do right now?
- What?

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.116
I'm gonna kiss you.

01:31:11.200 --> 01:31:12.429
What, is that a warning?

01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:13.636
Yeah, right now I'm gonna kiss you.

01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:17.475
First I'm gonna weave to the left,

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:19.313
bob to the right...

01:31:29.600 --> 01:31:31.000
I love you, baby.

01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:32.912
- I love you.
- Yeah?

01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:35.915
Good.

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:38.759
Come on. Let's get out of here.

01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:41.190
<i>Nice, huh?</i>

01:31:41.720 --> 01:31:43.996
<i>This is what they call a happy ending.</i>

01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:45.594
<i>Who would've thought it?</i>

01:31:45.680 --> 01:31:47.637
<i>Not me. Nope.</i>

01:31:48.240 --> 01:31:49.276
<i>See?</i>

01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:52.512
<i>Sometimes, life really is like a movie.</i>

01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:55.278
<i>Sometimes it's better.</i>
