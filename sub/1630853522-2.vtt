26:16.083 --> 26:17.125
All right.

26:17.208 --> 26:18.958
AAMIR: All right.
See you at dinner, Kamala.

26:19.041 --> 26:20.250
KAMRAN: Nice to see you.

26:21.333 --> 26:24.541
(IN NORMAL ACCENT) Shall we eat?
Because that was exhausting.

26:24.791 --> 26:25.958
(MUNEEBA CHUCKLING)

26:26.041 --> 26:27.583
YUSUF: That's our Aamir though.

26:28.291 --> 26:30.416
Never been afraid to reinvent himself.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.625
Like, hey, remember the time
you were working with...

26:33.708 --> 26:36.125
What was the name? Hot...

26:36.250 --> 26:38.125
-Hot...
-Hot Topic.

26:38.208 --> 26:39.416
-YUSUF: Topic!
-Hot Topic.

26:39.500 --> 26:42.708
Oh, my God,
please tell me you had a goth phase.

26:42.791 --> 26:45.541
-It wasn't a goth phase.
-Oh, yeah.

26:45.625 --> 26:47.000
I just wore a lot of black.

26:47.083 --> 26:49.208
Yeah, like so much spikey jewelry.

26:49.333 --> 26:51.458
-There was a choker.
-It wasn't mine.

26:51.541 --> 26:53.625
-YUSUF: Come on, come on.
-You did.

26:53.708 --> 26:55.750
That's why we moved to America, right?

26:55.833 --> 26:59.541
So that our children could be anything
that they wanted to be, yeah?

27:00.166 --> 27:01.791
-Almost anything.
-Yeah.

27:02.291 --> 27:04.666
Did your family live in Karachi
for a long time?

27:04.791 --> 27:05.875
Oh...

27:06.375 --> 27:11.333
My family has been in Karachi
for generations. Yeah.

27:11.416 --> 27:15.250
Muneeba's family moved to Karachi
only after the Partition.

27:15.333 --> 27:17.916
Back then, there was no Pakistan
or Bangladesh.

27:18.000 --> 27:20.541
It was all one big country, India.

27:21.583 --> 27:25.458
-After the British just...
-The British left us with a mess.

27:25.541 --> 27:28.833
It was very hard for many people.
And then there was a civil war.

27:28.916 --> 27:32.291
Every Pakistani family
has a Partition story.

27:32.375 --> 27:33.375
None of them are good.

27:33.458 --> 27:36.791
Okay, enough, this is not
about the Partition, okay?

27:36.875 --> 27:39.416
This is a celebration. Yusuf.

27:45.541 --> 27:46.708
(SOFTLY) Hey.

27:48.250 --> 27:52.291
There's a story about Muneeba's family
from during the Partition.

27:52.375 --> 27:55.708
You know, they had to get on
to the last train

27:55.791 --> 27:58.666
that was getting out of the city. Yeah?

27:58.750 --> 28:02.750
Now, her mother, Muneeba's mother, Sana,
who was just a toddler then,

28:03.208 --> 28:07.041
she got separated from her parents
on the train station.

28:07.166 --> 28:09.333
Her father tried to find her
but, you know,

28:09.416 --> 28:13.041
he was injured and needed a walking stick
to get around,

28:13.166 --> 28:15.000
so he couldn't really keep up with her.

28:16.333 --> 28:17.791
But here's the thing.

28:18.375 --> 28:22.583
Nobody knows how the little toddler, Sana,

28:22.708 --> 28:25.375
managed to get back on the train
just before...

28:25.458 --> 28:28.375
Just before the train
pulled out of the station.

28:29.208 --> 28:30.208
(CHUCKLES)

28:31.000 --> 28:34.666
What did Sana say happened?
How did she find her father?

28:40.208 --> 28:42.791
Well, Sana always said that

28:42.875 --> 28:45.958
-she followed a trail of stars...
-She followed a trail of stars

28:46.916 --> 28:48.333
right back to her father.

28:53.791 --> 28:56.166
What happened to Sana's mother?

28:57.250 --> 28:59.333
Oh, we don't know.

28:59.458 --> 29:02.458
She disappeared that night,
just like many others did.

29:05.750 --> 29:07.125
(ENERGY PULSATING)

29:11.583 --> 29:13.083

29:20.375 --> 29:22.250
YUSUF: Kamala?
AAMIR: Somebody grab the Zamzam.

29:22.375 --> 29:24.208
MUNEEBA: Kamala, are you okay, <i>beta?</i>

29:24.291 --> 29:25.916

-Mmm-hmm.

(AAMIR PRAYING)

29:27.666 --> 29:31.166

Or did you eat too much?

I can't see you.

29:58.833 --> 30:00.583
<i>What about it? Which one? What?</i>

30:00.666 --> 30:03.583
The bangle,
it does some really weird things.

30:03.666 --> 30:04.666
And it's...

30:04.750 --> 30:08.541
<i>That bangle belonged to my mother, Aisha.</i>

30:08.625 --> 30:12.041
The one who disappeared during Partition,

30:12.625 --> 30:14.541
<i>Let me talk to Aamir and his wife.</i>

30:14.625 --> 30:17.208
KAMALA: You can't talk to Aamir.
Look, about the bangle...

30:17.375 --> 30:19.791
<i>Oh. But no, I've spoken too much already.</i>

30:19.875 --> 30:22.791

Kamala?

30:24.041 --> 30:25.541
<i>Your mother will get very upset.</i>

30:25.791 --> 30:27.041
So this belonged to Aisha

30:27.125 --> 30:29.333

what happened to her?

31:13.291 --> 31:15.958
Trust me, even a cover band of Bon Jovi

31:16.041 --> 31:18.458
is gonna get people to talk
for a long time.

31:18.916 --> 31:22.541

-MUNEEBA: Mmm-hmm.

31:23.166 --> 31:24.166

Where did you hear that name?

31:49.750 --> 31:50.833
From <i>Nani.</i>

31:51.125 --> 31:53.666
I was talking to her last night
and it kinda came up.

31:53.750 --> 31:57.333
That woman brought shame
on our entire family.

around the world to forget it.

pretty identical. White girl, red hair...

She looks nothing like me.

what else do you know?

37:18.333 --> 37:19.833
-Hmm?
-Nothing.

I didn't really get a good look at her.
I mean, it all happened so fast.

Latinx now, right?

38:47.916 --> 38:50.416
My father called her a snake.

38:50.958 --> 38:53.666
She put a curse on everything she touched.

38:53.791 --> 38:54.791
Curse?

38:55.791 --> 38:58.000
I heard that she had a secret affair.

38:58.083 --> 38:59.291
And took off with someone.
