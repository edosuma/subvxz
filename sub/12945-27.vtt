she had a big blue monster

15:07.233 --> 15:08.800
living under her bed in the motel

to let her sleep in our room?

Yeah. Then Matt woke up alone
in their room

15:13.200 --> 15:14.633
and he thought
we'd gone home without him.

15:15.233 --> 15:17.567
Was that the year
Lizzie lost her two front teeth

15:18.033 --> 15:19.867

that the tooth fairy

were worth a buck apiece

15:24.667 --> 15:25.667
No, that was the next year,

Matt didn't want to start school

if he could just live here.
