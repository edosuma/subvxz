people think it's not legit.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.762
(others continue arguing)

10:01.226 --> 10:02.852
I don't get it!

10:02.936 --> 10:04.020
Wait, Spider-Man?

10:04.104 --> 10:05.689
He's a guy with spider powers.

10:05.772 --> 10:07.190
Can't I have one thing in my life?

10:07.273 --> 10:08.441
Is that too much to ask?

10:08.525 --> 10:10.026
What is it, do they hate me?

10:10.110 --> 10:12.278
Because astrologically I'm very compatible

10:12.362 --> 10:14.280
with Kyle H. and Lisa.

10:14.364 --> 10:16.282
I'm a Gemini and they're both Aquarius,

10:16.366 --> 10:18.118
so we're natural matches!

10:18.201 --> 10:20.120
Kyle is a Virgo,
which doesn't match with Gemini,

10:20.203 --> 10:22.539
but they're supposed
to at least care about people!

10:22.622 --> 10:24.207
What am I missing?

10:24.290 --> 10:26.209
You know, Mom, if you
really want to get noticed,

10:26.292 --> 10:28.044
you should save one of their lives.

10:28.128 --> 10:29.879
-What?
-There was a kid at school

10:29.963 --> 10:32.465
who got a whole page
in the yearbook dedicated to him

10:32.549 --> 10:35.468
because he saved a kid
who had a peanut allergy.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.512
Peanut allergy?

10:37.595 --> 10:39.347
I have a peanut allergy.

10:39.431 --> 10:42.934
Yeah. This kid accidentally ate
something with peanuts in it

10:43.018 --> 10:44.853
and the other kid came over

10:44.936 --> 10:46.855
and Pulp Fictioned him with an EpiPen.

10:46.938 --> 10:48.023
Huh...

10:48.106 --> 10:49.816
I can't even touch peanuts.

10:49.899 --> 10:52.277
That kid was a hero.

10:52.360 --> 10:53.737
Hero...

10:53.820 --> 10:54.904
You flush it!

10:54.988 --> 10:56.740
It scares me when it goes away.

10:58.324 --> 10:59.617
Yes... hero.

10:59.701 --> 11:00.994
I'll be a hero,

11:01.077 --> 11:02.787
and then they'll have
to make me Customer of the Week.

11:02.871 --> 11:05.165
Why is this story all about Mom this week?

11:05.248 --> 11:07.792
What, are we giving Seth's voice a rest?

11:13.590 --> 11:16.217
(electric guitar riff plays)

11:22.182 --> 11:25.477
Okay, I'll just pour
some of these Planters peanuts

11:25.560 --> 11:27.145
into Lisa's car.

11:27.228 --> 11:28.355
The official peanut

11:28.438 --> 11:29.898

11:29.981 --> 11:32.108
What?
No, she's kidding!

11:32.192 --> 11:33.526
Come on, look at me:

11:33.610 --> 11:35.987
top hat, gloves, shoes, no other clothes.

11:36.071 --> 11:37.364
I'm a good guy!

11:37.447 --> 11:40.784
Okay, now I wait for her to get in her car

11:40.867 --> 11:42.744
and start to have a reaction.

11:42.827 --> 11:45.538
Then I'll swoop in
and save her with this EpiPen.

11:45.622 --> 11:48.166
Then I'll be a lock
to be Customer of the Week.

11:48.249 --> 11:50.293
Stewie, you okay back there?

11:50.377 --> 11:52.587
Having fun playing with Mommy's phone?

11:52.671 --> 11:54.673
Yup. I put the headphones up my nose,

11:54.756 --> 11:55.924
but I made it work.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.552
Okay, there she is.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.388
She's walking to her car...

12:01.471 --> 12:03.056
she's getting out her keys...

12:03.139 --> 12:04.766
she's starting her car...

12:04.849 --> 12:06.059
driving away?

12:10.313 --> 12:13.191
Damn it, I didn't put
enough peanuts in there.

12:15.026 --> 12:16.277
Oh, shaving cream!

12:17.946 --> 12:20.323
Ooh, shaving cream.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.536
Oh...

12:24.619 --> 12:27.205
shaving cream.

12:31.751 --> 12:32.669
Oh, good.

12:34.337 --> 12:36.006
Oh, shaving cream.

12:42.178 --> 12:45.473
Mom, why are we at the hospital
to visit your barista?

12:45.557 --> 12:48.059
Chris, I promise
that if one of your baristas

12:48.143 --> 12:50.770
ever gets into an accident,
I'll go to the hospital, too.

12:50.854 --> 12:52.647
Okay. That's all I wanted to hear.

12:52.731 --> 12:55.859
I've got a lot of baristas
who make questionable choices.

12:55.942 --> 12:58.778
Hi, you must be Lisa's mother.

12:58.862 --> 12:59.904
How's she doing?

12:59.988 --> 13:01.656
Did she say what happened?

13:01.740 --> 13:03.950
No, she's mostly just said...

13:04.034 --> 13:05.910
(ghastly moaning)

13:05.994 --> 13:07.829
Oh, that's not a good moan.

13:07.912 --> 13:10.415
Well, apparently,
someone put peanuts in her car

13:10.498 --> 13:12.000
and she's deathly allergic.

13:12.083 --> 13:13.251
Oh, no.

13:13.335 --> 13:14.961
Here are flowers.

13:15.045 --> 13:17.255
STEWIE:
She took those from a guardrail memorial.

13:17.339 --> 13:19.299
D-Do they have any leads
on who could have done it?

13:19.382 --> 13:20.300
No.

13:20.383 --> 13:21.760
Good. Grief!

13:21.843 --> 13:24.429
"Good grief," is what
Charlie Brown would say here.

13:24.512 --> 13:26.556
Peanuts.
Probably a poor choice of reference.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.683
But they're going to check
the parking lot surveillance tape

13:28.767 --> 13:29.893
to see who did.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.228
Surveillance tape?
Good grief!

13:32.312 --> 13:33.813
Uh, who are you again?

13:33.897 --> 13:36.232
I'm a... a very good customer.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.776
Oh, my God, I've got to go.

13:37.859 --> 13:39.778
Exit stage left!

13:42.238 --> 13:45.658
That was a very sad door to run in to.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.672
What the hell?
Lois?

14:01.341 --> 14:03.176
LOIS:
Put the phone down, Kyle H.

14:05.428 --> 14:06.805
...so then I start hearing people say

14:06.888 --> 14:08.306
there are different levels

14:08.390 --> 14:10.016
of peanut allergies
and I was like, "Levels?"

14:10.100 --> 14:12.686
I mean, when I hear allergy, I think rash,

14:12.769 --> 14:14.854
not throat-close-car-crash.

14:14.938 --> 14:17.899
Okay, well, I-I'm so glad
that we could talk about this

14:17.982 --> 14:20.485
and that you understand
how we got to where we are.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.070
So, are you gonna let me go?

14:22.153 --> 14:23.321
Yes.

14:23.405 --> 14:25.323
I mean, once I figure out
this whole kerfuffle.

14:25.407 --> 14:26.408
Oh.

14:26.491 --> 14:28.827
Why, are you scared, Kyle H.?

14:28.910 --> 14:31.413
This isn't scary.

14:31.496 --> 14:33.039
I'm a good person.

14:33.123 --> 14:35.583
Now, there are two ways
we can go from here:

14:35.667 --> 14:37.502
you can give me your absolute trust,

14:37.585 --> 14:40.296
or I can get you hooked on heroin.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.881
Heroin's not bad.

14:41.965 --> 14:44.843
Not having heroin, that's what's bad.

14:44.926 --> 14:47.345
Y-You can trust me.
It's just...

14:47.429 --> 14:48.471
Just what?

14:48.555 --> 14:49.806
I have a cat.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.349
Someone needs to feed him.

14:51.433 --> 14:54.185
(long inhale)

14:54.269 --> 14:57.564
Now, a bad person
would say "who cares" here.

14:57.647 --> 15:00.150
But since I am a good person,

15:00.233 --> 15:02.235
I will take care of your cat.

15:02.318 --> 15:03.987
Now, open your mouth, I'm gonna stuff

15:04.070 --> 15:05.488
my son's baseball sock in it.

15:16.541 --> 15:18.626
What the hell?
Who are you?

15:18.710 --> 15:20.003
Oh, hello.

15:20.086 --> 15:23.673
Um, hi, I'm Kyle H.'s cat-sitter.

15:23.757 --> 15:26.009
He didn't tell me he had roommates

15:26.092 --> 15:28.094
who could feed his cat for him.

15:28.178 --> 15:30.889
Wait, why do you have his laser pointer

15:30.972 --> 15:32.724
and Heisenberg keychain?

15:32.807 --> 15:35.268
Yeah, his keychain flair is how
he expresses his quirkiness.

15:35.352 --> 15:36.686
He must be in danger!

15:41.983 --> 15:43.860
You can't leave us like this, lady.

15:43.943 --> 15:44.986
Don't say "lady."

15:45.070 --> 15:46.321
It makes me feel old.

15:46.404 --> 15:48.573
And why is everyone acting
like this is my fault?

15:48.656 --> 15:50.992
If anything, it's Kyle H.'s fault.

15:51.076 --> 15:52.744
I'm a good person.

15:52.827 --> 15:54.329
People are gonna know we're gone.

15:54.412 --> 15:55.663
I promised my boyfriend that I'd...

15:55.747 --> 15:57.040
-Wait, you're gay?
-Yeah.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.291
You sound surprised.

15:58.375 --> 15:59.918
I don't know,
you just don't present as gay.

16:00.001 --> 16:01.378
Oh, so gays "present"?

16:01.461 --> 16:02.921
No, no, no, that's not...

16:03.004 --> 16:05.006
What? I'm woke, okay?

16:05.090 --> 16:06.007
Is he your boyfriend?

16:06.091 --> 16:07.133
No, I'm not gay.

16:07.217 --> 16:09.010
What?
But you're roommates.

16:09.094 --> 16:10.845
-So?
-So?!

16:10.929 --> 16:12.013
And that's not weird?

16:12.097 --> 16:13.723
I mean, do you have your own bathrooms?

16:13.807 --> 16:15.350
-No.
-What, so you just walk around

16:15.433 --> 16:17.852
-like there's nothing potentially sexual?
-Yeah.

16:17.936 --> 16:20.021
Yeah. I mean,
ever since he joined the gym,

16:20.105 --> 16:21.523
he's really turned his body around.

16:21.606 --> 16:23.233
But that's not what I'd be attracted to.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.568
It's more sticking to his commitment
to get healthy.

16:25.652 --> 16:27.862
-That's attractive.
-Aw, thank you, bro.

16:27.946 --> 16:28.947
Mm, you're welcome, bro.

16:29.030 --> 16:30.490
See, this!

16:30.573 --> 16:32.742
I don't know.
I-I guess I'm not woke, okay?

16:32.826 --> 16:34.786
Fine, you win with your gay stuff.

16:34.869 --> 16:36.663
That's what you want, right?
To win?

16:36.746 --> 16:40.000
Here, drink whatever you think
a day's worth of water is.

16:40.083 --> 16:41.710
Look, what I was trying to say is that

16:41.793 --> 16:44.254
you can't leave us like this
because I promised my boyfriend

16:44.337 --> 16:46.548
that I'd make a meal
for his grandmother's meal train.

16:46.631 --> 16:49.217
If I don't drop it off,
they're gonna know something's wrong.

16:49.300 --> 16:52.220
(long inhale)

16:52.303 --> 16:53.680
(exhales)

16:53.763 --> 16:55.348
What are you supposed to make?

16:55.432 --> 16:57.934
-Beef Wellington.
-What... Beef Wellington?!

16:58.018 --> 16:59.310
-For tonight?
-Yeah, why?

16:59.394 --> 17:00.645
-Is that hard?
-Yes!

17:00.729 --> 17:04.149
If you're starting
at 2:00 p.m., very! Yes!

17:09.696 --> 17:11.614
Lois, have you seen the pooping iPad?

17:11.698 --> 17:13.783
I can only go while watching Tiger King .

17:13.867 --> 17:15.577
-Huh?
-The iPad we use only

17:15.660 --> 17:18.163
while pooping and occasionally
on flights for Stewie.

17:18.246 --> 17:21.124
Ew, I play Elmo's ABCs on that.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.251
Is that why I keep getting pink eye?

17:24.252 --> 17:25.628
I don't know where it is.

17:25.712 --> 17:26.838
But it's definitely not in the shed.

17:26.921 --> 17:28.423
So don't even look back there in the shed.

17:28.506 --> 17:30.592
What, you mean the earwig fortress?
No thanks.

17:30.675 --> 17:32.010
I haven't been in there

17:32.093 --> 17:33.386
since I won the Battle of the Wheelbarrow.

17:33.470 --> 17:34.888
Nyah-ha!

17:34.971 --> 17:37.557
Too fast and too smart for you, earwigs.

17:39.267 --> 17:42.145
Now, to continue clearing the yard...

17:42.228 --> 17:45.815
(monotone): ...collecting moisture
and sleeping in wood.

17:45.899 --> 17:47.567
Hey, Lois, what ever happened to

17:47.650 --> 17:49.361
-that Customer of the Week thing?
-Th-The what?

17:49.444 --> 17:51.071
The Customer of the Week
at the coffee shop.

17:51.154 --> 17:52.238
Did you ever win?

17:52.322 --> 17:53.490
Why?
Why would you bring that up?

17:53.573 --> 17:54.699
What are you, obsessed with it?

17:54.783 --> 17:56.868
Uh, you-you had been talking about it...

17:56.951 --> 17:58.703
Oh, so you can hear me when I say that,

17:58.787 --> 18:00.455
but can't hear me
when I say "get off the couch."

18:00.538 --> 18:02.165
I like to be up by people.

18:02.248 --> 18:04.292
May I be excused to...

18:04.376 --> 18:07.796
(monotone): bring this plate of moisture
to the crawl space?

18:09.964 --> 18:11.466
Yeah, for the record,

18:11.549 --> 18:12.759
I would rather drink a sinus infection

18:12.842 --> 18:14.010
than win that stupid award.

18:14.094 --> 18:15.595
It's all rigged anyway.

18:15.679 --> 18:18.223
Did you know that Lester
lived in the same building as Lisa?

18:18.306 --> 18:20.100
How is that fair, huh?

18:20.183 --> 18:22.811
God, what a boring thing
to bring up at dinner, Brian.

18:22.894 --> 18:24.604
I'm going to the sunroom,

18:24.688 --> 18:27.273
and that's where I'll be from
9:00 to 11:00 if anyone asks.

18:27.357 --> 18:29.067
No one come check on me.

19:36.426 --> 19:38.178
And you can put in one load of laundry.

19:38.261 --> 19:39.721
Then I got to take you in.

19:39.804 --> 19:41.306
(whispering)

19:41.389 --> 19:43.475
After that, you can
write down the Wi-Fi log-in.

19:43.558 --> 19:45.518
Then I got to take you in.

19:45.602 --> 19:46.895
(whispering)

19:46.978 --> 19:48.480
Where's the peanut butter?

19:48.563 --> 19:49.898
(whispering)

19:49.981 --> 19:51.483
Well, Peter, I think
the main difference is

19:51.566 --> 19:53.234
Chinese people are from China

19:53.318 --> 19:55.278
and Japanese people are from Japan.

19:55.362 --> 19:56.821
(whispering)

19:56.905 --> 20:00.283
Yes, that's probably why you
were banned from the restaurant.

20:03.787 --> 20:05.705
(lock buzzes)

20:05.789 --> 20:07.791
♪ ♪

20:29.187 --> 20:31.106
Good morning.

20:31.189 --> 20:33.400
Ah, what a charming place this is.

20:33.483 --> 20:35.944
Oh, look, you do a Customer of the Week.

20:36.027 --> 20:37.362
How cute.

20:37.445 --> 20:40.907
Now, I'll take a Nitro Cold Brew.

20:40.990 --> 20:43.451
And with the morning I've had,
better make it a large.

20:43.535 --> 20:45.120
Hey, that's funny.

20:45.203 --> 20:46.996
Yeah, I know.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.665
There you go.

20:49.791 --> 20:52.502
And there you go.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.213
Well, you could have said thank you.

20:55.296 --> 20:57.966
Don't see a lot
of five dollar bills in there.

20:58.049 --> 21:01.261
I must be a pretty good person
to give a five.
