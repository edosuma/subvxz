NARRATOR: Last time, on Beast Wars:

00:34.638 --> 00:40.206
Optimus Primal, I have a matter of some urgency to discuss.

00:40.306 --> 00:41.639
RATTRAP: A truce?

00:41.740 --> 00:45.006
I cannot believe you agreed to this.

00:46.773 --> 00:50.607
WASPINATOR: Why is spiderbot taking transwarp cell?

00:50.707 --> 00:54.641
The answer is simple. I'm leaving.

00:54.742 --> 00:55.842
( beeping )

00:55.942 --> 00:57.875
( explosion ) ( cackling )

01:00.142 --> 01:02.509
By the Matrix.

01:02.609 --> 01:04.410
( thunder rumbling )

01:04.510 --> 01:07.210
Megatron has found a strange Golden Disk

01:07.310 --> 01:09.111
of alien manufacture.

01:09.211 --> 01:13.511
The aliens, the ones who seeded this planet with energon,

01:13.611 --> 01:15.945
the ones who created that flying island

01:16.045 --> 01:19.512
that almost destroyed us, they're on their way here.

01:19.612 --> 01:23.046
That's just prime.

Display coordinates and cross-reference energy signature

with data tracks tile seven.

01:50.617 --> 01:52.618
( beeping )

01:58.652 --> 02:03.487
Energy signature identical with previous alien contact.

02:03.586 --> 02:07.987
Looks like our unknown friends have finally arrived.

02:08.087 --> 02:11.421
Just what we need. A visit from the landlord.

02:17.756 --> 02:21.390
Rattrap and Airazor are closest. Tell them to check it out.

02:24.123 --> 02:25.189
I'll meet them there.

02:25.289 --> 02:28.124
The Preds will have picked up this signal.

02:28.224 --> 02:31.758
We still have a truce. I hope.

02:41.726 --> 02:42.626
( beeping )

02:42.726 --> 02:44.860
( chuckling )

02:44.960 --> 02:48.360
They're here as I anticipated,

02:48.460 --> 02:51.861
given the data I hacked from Megatron's private files.

02:51.961 --> 02:55.728
Computer, calculate next stasis pod landing.

02:55.828 --> 03:00.729
COMPUTER: Stasis pod will achieve planet fall in 30.6 mega-cycles.

03:00.829 --> 03:03.263
Slag! Not soon enough.

03:03.363 --> 03:06.964
I must find another means of escaping this dirt ball.

03:07.063 --> 03:11.297
And why would you want to do that, partner?

03:11.398 --> 03:13.031
( grumbling )

03:13.131 --> 03:16.865
I'm not your partner. Now go away!

03:16.965 --> 03:19.799
But you don't have a choice, legs.

03:19.899 --> 03:21.565
( clicks tongue then sighs )

03:21.665 --> 03:23.366
You don't want me telling Megatron

03:23.466 --> 03:26.034
about the transwarp cell you stole, do you?

03:26.134 --> 03:27.533
( grumbling )

03:27.633 --> 03:31.734
Besides, you need me to get past the Maximals' defense shield.

03:31.834 --> 03:36.702
Heh-heh. To what end? The Axalon will never fly again.

03:36.802 --> 03:41.069
Granted. But the Maximals have intact stasis pods.

03:41.169 --> 03:44.903
A clever spider, one with a transwarp cell,

03:45.003 --> 03:49.537
might use such a stasis pod to create an escape ship.

03:49.637 --> 03:51.437
Hm.

03:51.537 --> 03:54.972
Most of the Maximals are off chasing that power anomaly.

03:55.071 --> 03:58.872
We could have that pod in just under two mega-cycles.

03:58.972 --> 04:02.639
So, what do you say, partner?

04:02.739 --> 04:04.306
( Megatron chuckles )

04:04.407 --> 04:08.473
Ah. The inevitable treachery. Yes.

04:08.573 --> 04:12.975
Properly guided, it should serve me well.

04:15.975 --> 04:19.876
So back online, are we?

04:19.976 --> 04:23.610
No, no thanks to Tarantulas.

04:23.710 --> 04:26.643
Oh, Waspinator find spiderbot

04:26.743 --> 04:29.977
and tear him a new waste disposal unit!

04:30.077 --> 04:32.711
I have no time for these petty squabbles now.

04:32.811 --> 04:35.345
No. Larger goals are at stake.

04:35.445 --> 04:39.279
Proceed at once to coordinates 6-5-9 and secure the area.

04:39.378 --> 04:40.578
I will follow shortly.

04:40.678 --> 04:42.479
Not fair!

04:42.579 --> 04:47.080
Waspinator always gets slag assignments.

04:47.180 --> 04:50.514
May I remind Waspinator that the current ceasefire

04:50.614 --> 04:52.415
applies only in reference to Maximals?

04:52.515 --> 04:56.181
Ooh! Waspinator go.

04:58.815 --> 05:00.749
That's better.

05:02.315 --> 05:05.749
Hm. From now on, I must play this carefully.

05:05.849 --> 05:09.184
Very carefully, indeed.

05:09.284 --> 05:11.151
( dramatic theme playing )

05:11.251 --> 05:13.718
AIRAZOR: Looks like we found the source of the anomaly.

05:13.818 --> 05:15.618
Ooh, lucky us.

05:15.718 --> 05:18.018
Now we can be the first to get vaped.

05:18.118 --> 05:20.152
Do you ever think positively?

05:20.252 --> 05:22.952
Hey, that was positive, sister.

05:23.053 --> 05:24.453
You know, I could've said,

05:24.553 --> 05:26.553
"Now we can be the first to get tortured

05:26.653 --> 05:28.487
and then vaped."

05:28.586 --> 05:31.220
You're a real funbot, you know that?

05:44.556 --> 05:46.023

05:50.057 --> 05:53.824
Strip my circuits and call me a toaster.

05:53.924 --> 05:56.458
This crystal is stable.

05:57.892 --> 06:01.759
Then I should be able to scan it safely.

06:07.593 --> 06:09.527
It's a field generator,

06:09.627 --> 06:11.760

06:59.502 --> 07:02.903
Oh, this is not good.

07:06.236 --> 07:08.203
Rattrap to Optimus.

07:08.303 --> 07:10.970
Come in, fearless leader.

07:11.070 --> 07:13.371
Optimus here. Have you reached the anomaly?

07:13.471 --> 07:18.439
Have I ever! It's some kind of nutty alien bungalow.

07:18.539 --> 07:20.839
And it swallowed Airazor.

07:20.939 --> 07:23.639
You better get your monkey butt over here before--

No, Waspinator secures area.

08:13.815 --> 08:15.815
( suspenseful theme playing )

08:17.881 --> 08:22.382
No, Maximal will leave or be scrapped.

08:22.482 --> 08:27.483
Unh. No chance, bug face. I got here first, heh.

08:27.583 --> 08:31.717
Besides, we got a cease-fire goin', remember?

08:31.818 --> 08:36.218
So? Waspinator not shoot.

09:26.026 --> 09:28.426
Now get lost.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.427
No, not--

09:30.527 --> 09:34.627
Waspinator thinks area is secure enough.

09:34.727 --> 09:35.928
( whimpering )

09:42.062 --> 09:43.596

09:47.830 --> 09:50.197
I swear, I can't take you anywhere.

Hey, heh-heh, just, uh, keepin' the peace.

09:54.730 --> 09:57.131
( sighs )

09:57.231 --> 09:59.132
So Airazor's in there, is she?

09:59.232 --> 10:00.832
Is there a way in?

10:00.932 --> 10:03.165
You see a doorbell anywhere?

10:07.467 --> 10:08.867
Try a cutting laser.

10:10.567 --> 10:12.201
You got it.

10:41.738 --> 10:43.206
Megatron!

10:43.306 --> 10:46.140
Holy Swiss cheese, we're in for it now.

10:48.474 --> 10:51.107
Did you really expect energy beams to work?

10:51.207 --> 10:54.408
These aliens can create energon itself.

10:54.508 --> 10:57.042
I suggest a different tactic.

10:57.141 --> 10:58.242
Biological?

10:58.341 --> 11:00.975
Exactly. Scorponok.

11:03.375 --> 11:06.043
One toxic sting comin' up.

11:12.077 --> 11:13.944
Looks like you guessed right, Megatron.

11:14.044 --> 11:16.277
But a Maximal's the one trapped inside.

11:16.377 --> 11:18.011
We go in first.

11:18.111 --> 11:21.111
Hey, hey, hey! What's this "we" stuff?

11:21.212 --> 11:22.645
Hm.

11:22.745 --> 11:25.513
Yes, but of course. Be my guest.

11:25.613 --> 11:28.047
We do have a truce, remember?

11:28.147 --> 11:31.681
Just as long as you don't forget.

11:33.481 --> 11:35.048
All right, Rattrap, let's go.

11:38.281 --> 11:43.182
Oh, man, I want extra hazard pay for this.

11:43.282 --> 11:45.983
This is a calculated risk.

11:46.083 --> 11:48.850
We shall lets the Maximals serve as primary targets.

11:48.950 --> 11:50.750
But if things go awry...

11:50.851 --> 11:53.151
I got a mega missile right here.

11:53.251 --> 11:55.451
I can fire it right through that hole.

11:55.551 --> 12:00.152
Excellent. Now if only Inferno was doing his job as well.

12:00.252 --> 12:02.919
( dramatic theme playing )

12:15.721 --> 12:18.155
( chattering )

12:21.355 --> 12:22.589
Airazor!

12:29.890 --> 12:31.691
Get her out of here. Quickly!

12:31.790 --> 12:34.657
Man, you don't gotta tell me twice.

12:41.825 --> 12:44.626
Optimus, don't stay.

12:44.726 --> 12:47.826
I have to. Since our arrival on this planet,

12:47.926 --> 12:51.794
we haven't exactly been the best of tenants.

12:51.894 --> 12:55.228
These aliens have a right to expect some answers.

12:55.328 --> 12:58.095
Optimus. No.

13:00.795 --> 13:03.629
All right. Whoever you are--

13:03.729 --> 13:07.497

13:14.164 --> 13:16.898

( green light humming )

13:37.068 --> 13:39.068
( dramatic theme playing )

13:55.271 --> 13:58.638
You said you could breach their shield. Prove it.

14:02.672 --> 14:07.806
You're not the only techno-head around here, partner.

14:10.106 --> 14:12.107
( buttons beep )

14:17.741 --> 14:19.008
Spiffy little gizmo, huh?

14:19.108 --> 14:22.976
Hmph. We'll move in by the roof hatch.

14:28.810 --> 14:30.676
Ah, the Royalty was right.

14:30.776 --> 14:34.077
The spiders spin their own web of intrigue.

14:37.578 --> 14:39.945

( crunch )

14:49.013 --> 14:51.013
( Waspinator screaming )

14:52.847 --> 14:55.814
Ah, would that I could have that sound

14:55.914 --> 14:58.248
to lull me to sleep each night.

14:58.348 --> 15:00.748
They're comin' out.

15:00.848 --> 15:04.315
We can't leave Optimus in there.

15:04.415 --> 15:08.149
Unh. Hey, ours is not to reason why,

15:08.250 --> 15:11.717
but to blow this joint before we die.

15:11.817 --> 15:15.684

15:16.684 --> 15:19.452

15:21.118 --> 15:23.019
( dramatic theme playing )

15:23.119 --> 15:27.987
( sighing ): Let me guess. The truce is over.

15:28.086 --> 15:30.087
( screaming )

15:35.354 --> 15:36.988
VOICE: Scan complete.

15:37.088 --> 15:40.288
This is the specimen we analyzed before.

15:41.488 --> 15:43.622
( grunting )

15:43.722 --> 15:45.756
Who are you?

15:48.656 --> 15:50.423
( wind howls )

15:54.924 --> 15:56.924
( dramatic theme playing )

16:02.092 --> 16:03.292
Unicron!

16:03.392 --> 16:07.659
We have no physical form you could comprehend.

16:07.759 --> 16:11.160
We chose this figure of authority from your data tracks.

16:11.260 --> 16:13.127
If you've scanned me,

16:13.227 --> 16:16.728
you know that we did not come to this planet by choice.

16:16.828 --> 16:19.328
Yet you are here.

16:19.428 --> 16:21.362
We mean no harm.

16:21.462 --> 16:23.695
To you or this planet.

16:23.795 --> 16:25.729
It is too late.

16:25.829 --> 16:27.263
You and your enemies

16:27.363 --> 16:30.130
have already contaminated the project.

16:30.230 --> 16:32.364
The harm has been done.

16:32.464 --> 16:35.497
That which does not become part of the one

16:35.597 --> 16:37.664
shall become void.

16:37.764 --> 16:41.298
No! Wait! We can fix whatever damage was done.

16:41.398 --> 16:43.999
We are not interested.

16:44.099 --> 16:46.666
The experiment will be sterilized.

16:46.766 --> 16:50.100
You can't do that! There are living creatures here.

16:50.200 --> 16:53.901
You, with all your power, even you have no right.

16:54.001 --> 16:56.668
We have no choice.

16:56.767 --> 16:59.401
There is more danger than you know.

16:59.501 --> 17:02.868
Begin termination sequence.

17:05.903 --> 17:07.503
No!

17:07.602 --> 17:09.470
( alarm blaring )

17:10.537 --> 17:12.237
( grunts )

17:12.337 --> 17:15.004
Optimus Primal, maximize!

17:15.104 --> 17:17.237
( dramatic rock theme playing )

17:23.438 --> 17:24.772
( grunting )

17:24.872 --> 17:26.206
Hey!

17:26.306 --> 17:28.606
( both grunting )

17:28.706 --> 17:32.107
Huh? Yaah!

17:32.207 --> 17:33.440
( grunting )

17:36.008 --> 17:37.674
Why, you little--!

17:37.774 --> 17:39.608
Back off!

17:39.708 --> 17:41.009
( grunts )

17:44.509 --> 17:45.709
( grunts )

17:47.175 --> 17:49.177
( Optimus yells )

17:56.044 --> 17:58.511
Hey, big banana, what gives?

17:58.611 --> 18:01.045
They called it a termination sequence.

18:01.145 --> 18:02.379
We'd better get out of here!

18:02.479 --> 18:04.612
You just said my favorite phrase.

18:04.712 --> 18:05.946
( gasps )

18:13.014 --> 18:16.981
Fortunately, there is still another hand to be played.

18:23.382 --> 18:25.383
( dramatic rock theme playing )

19:07.123 --> 19:09.956
SENTINEL: Massive energon surge emanating from Grid Trion.

19:10.056 --> 19:11.490
Communications impossible.

19:11.590 --> 19:13.523
Can you track the stasis pods?

19:13.623 --> 19:14.558
Negative.

19:14.657 --> 19:16.357
Divert all power to space scanner.

19:16.457 --> 19:18.291
Lock on their beam and ride it.

19:18.391 --> 19:20.292
Boosting power. Interlocking.

19:20.392 --> 19:23.358
Lock achieved. Imaging.

19:25.559 --> 19:27.859
What the slagging-- ( metal clicks )

19:31.227 --> 19:33.160
( groaning )

19:36.327 --> 19:38.562
Invaders!

19:39.928 --> 19:42.528
( grunting )

19:52.363 --> 19:54.630
What is it?

19:54.730 --> 19:59.064
The beginning of the end.

19:59.164 --> 20:01.165
( dramatic theme playing )

20:08.266 --> 20:10.967
NARRATOR: Next time, on Beast Wars:

20:11.066 --> 20:14.100
Oh, just when thought things couldn't get any worse.

20:14.201 --> 20:17.834
Planetary destruction in 28.5 cycles.

20:17.935 --> 20:19.401
( screaming )

20:19.501 --> 20:23.669
The Maximal base. And the shield is down.

20:24.902 --> 20:26.069
( screaming )

20:26.169 --> 20:29.303
If you find them, I want them functional.

20:29.403 --> 20:32.870
COMPUTER: Three, two, one, zero.

20:32.970 --> 20:37.704
OPTIMUS: Megatron!

20:37.804 --> 20:40.538
I rather like these aliens.

20:48.940 --> 20:51.906
