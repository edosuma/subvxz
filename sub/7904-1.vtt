00:49.917 --> 00:53.121
( drums beating )

00:57.491 --> 00:59.727
( chanting )

02:18.939 --> 02:22.210
( heavy breathing )

02:25.579 --> 02:28.282
( gunfire )

02:39.260 --> 02:41.229
* ...A NOTION DEEP INSIDE

02:41.262 --> 02:44.798
* THAT IT AIN'T NO SIN
TO BE GLAD YOU'RE ALIVE

02:44.832 --> 02:48.302
* I WANT TO FIND ONE FACE
THAT AIN'T LOOKING THROUGH ME

02:48.336 --> 02:49.903
* I WANT TO FIND ONE PLACE

02:49.937 --> 02:53.607
* I WANT TO SPIT IN THE FACE
OF THESE BADLANDS

02:53.641 --> 02:55.609
* YOU'VE GOT TO LIVE IT
EVERY DAY

02:55.643 --> 02:59.313
* LET THE BROKEN HEART STAND
AS THE PRICE YOU'VE GOT TO PAY

02:59.347 --> 03:01.349
* KEEP MOVING
TILL IT'S UNDERSTOOD

03:01.382 --> 03:03.884
* AND THESE BADLANDS
START TREATING US GOOD. *

03:06.520 --> 03:08.389
WWEN weather watch says

03:08.422 --> 03:10.491
temperatures will remain
in the mid-90s

03:10.524 --> 03:13.594
for the D.C. area
with high humidity readings...

03:13.627 --> 03:16.330
Continuing with talk radio,
this is Roger on the air.

03:16.364 --> 03:19.433
Who's this nimble brain
talking to us?

03:21.535 --> 03:23.304
( horn honking )

03:23.337 --> 03:26.307
And next Tuesday night is
Fan Appreciate Night at...

03:26.340 --> 03:29.277
( horn honking )

03:29.310 --> 03:31.845
870 on your A.M. dial.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.814
And now,
stay tuned for more...

03:33.847 --> 03:35.949
The inbound commute
from Virginia on the loop

03:35.983 --> 03:37.485
is congested

03:37.518 --> 03:38.719
to
the Springfield interchange.

03:38.752 --> 03:40.288
The reason...

03:40.288 --> 03:41.989
El desfile
fue estupendo, verdad?

03:42.022 --> 03:43.657
Ya lo creo.

03:43.691 --> 03:45.393
Yo lo vi...

03:45.426 --> 03:47.728
The sky was bright orange
and could be seen

03:47.761 --> 03:50.331
from as far away
as ten miles...

04:05.746 --> 04:06.647
( door opening )

04:06.680 --> 04:08.582
LEVOI.

04:08.616 --> 04:11.585
YOUR NAME POPPED UP
THIS MORNING, RAYMOND.

04:11.619 --> 04:13.754
IMPRESSIVE BACKGROUND--

04:13.787 --> 04:15.923
TWO YEARS STREET WORK

04:15.956 --> 04:17.658
THREE YEARS UNDERGROUND.

04:17.690 --> 04:20.560
YOU'VE DONE
SOME FINE DEEP COVER WORK.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.062
THANK YOU, SIR.

04:22.095 --> 04:23.631
HOW'S THE COLONEL?

04:23.664 --> 04:25.533
MY FATHER IS FINE, SIR.

04:25.566 --> 04:26.967
HE SENDS HIS REGARDS.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.369
HE'S A GOOD MAN.

04:30.671 --> 04:33.641
I WAS JUST LOOKING OVER
YOUR FAMILY TREE HERE.

04:33.674 --> 04:34.942
IT'S QUITE A MIXTURE--

04:34.975 --> 04:35.943
LITHUANIAN

04:35.976 --> 04:37.445
SCOTCH-IRISH...

04:37.478 --> 04:38.879
FRENCH...

04:38.912 --> 04:41.649
AND AMERICAN INDIAN.

04:41.682 --> 04:42.850
SIOUX INDIAN, IS IT?

04:42.883 --> 04:45.085
I, UH, DON'T KNOW, SIR.

04:45.118 --> 04:46.954
SIOUX.

04:46.987 --> 04:48.956
YOUR REAL FATHER WAS HALF
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

04:50.591 --> 04:52.426
I DIDN'T KNOW MY FATHER, SIR.

04:52.460 --> 04:54.061
HE DIED WHEN I WAS A BABY.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.963
HE DIED
WHEN YOU WERE SEVEN.

04:58.432 --> 05:00.634
I'M PULLING YOU
OUT OF YOUR PROVINCE.

05:00.668 --> 05:02.102
SENSITIVE OPERATIONS UNIT.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.104
TWO-MAN TEAM.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.473
YOU'LL WORK UNDER COUTELLE.

05:05.506 --> 05:06.640
ASAC, DENVER.

05:06.674 --> 05:07.741
FRANK COUTELLE?

05:07.775 --> 05:09.009
YOU KNOW COOCH?

05:09.042 --> 05:10.378
NO, SIR, BUT I...

05:10.411 --> 05:13.447
HIS CAREER IS... FANTASTIC.

05:14.014 --> 05:15.115
HE'S A LEGEND.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.618
LEGENDARY PAIN IN THE ASS.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.087
NOW THERE'S AN OLD DOG
WHO DOESN'T LIKE NEW TRICKS...

05:20.120 --> 05:22.122
OR NEW AGENTS ON HIS BLOCK.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.392
BUT HE'S TOP-SHELF.

05:24.425 --> 05:28.061
THANK YOU
FOR THE ASSIGNMENT, SIR.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.797
WHERE IS HIS BLOCK?

05:29.830 --> 05:31.599
THE BADLANDS.

05:31.632 --> 05:32.533
SOUTH DAKOTA.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.468
THERE'S BEEN A HOMICIDE
ON THE INDIAN LAND.

05:34.502 --> 05:36.970
SEVERAL IN RECENT YEARS.

05:37.004 --> 05:39.973
THERE'S A MILITANT GROUP
OPERATING ON THE RESERVATION.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.443
CALL THEMSELVES "ARM"--

05:42.476 --> 05:44.478
ABORIGINAL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.

05:46.714 --> 05:48.416
EXTREMELY VIOLENT.

05:48.449 --> 05:50.451
THEY SAY THEY'VE GONE THERE
TO DEFEND

05:50.484 --> 05:52.986
TRADITIONAL NATIVES
AGAINST
PRO-GOVERNMENT NATIVES.

05:53.020 --> 05:53.987
IT'S TURNED

05:54.021 --> 05:56.457
INTO A CIVIL CONFLICT,
INDIAN AGAINST INDIAN.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.091
PLACE IS A TINDERBOX.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.994
NOW, THIS IS
A MURDER INVESTIGATION

06:03.431 --> 06:05.933
BUT IT'S ALSO
ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE--

06:05.966 --> 06:09.903
HELPING PEOPLE CAUGHT
IN THE ILLUSIONS OF THE PAST

06:09.937 --> 06:12.573
COME TO TERMS
WITH THE REALITIES
OF THE PRESENT.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.107
ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS?

06:14.141 --> 06:15.843
MY ASSIGNMENT, SIR.

06:15.876 --> 06:16.877
WHAT...

06:16.910 --> 06:18.679
WHAT'S MY COVER?

06:18.712 --> 06:20.781
NO COVER.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.950
YOU'RE GOING IN THERE
AS WHO YOU ARE--

06:22.983 --> 06:25.753
AN AMERICAN INDIAN
FEDERAL OFFICER.

06:25.786 --> 06:29.089
I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE
WITH A NATIVE AMERICAN
REPRESENTATIVE IN THERE

06:29.122 --> 06:32.660
THAT WE CAN
DIFFUSE THE TENSION
AND IMPROVE RELATIONS.

06:32.693 --> 06:35.829
AS LONG AS OUR P.R. OFFICER'S
DISSEMINATING INFORMATION

06:35.863 --> 06:39.166
THAT WE'RE SENDING THE INDIANS
ONE OF THEIR OWN

06:39.199 --> 06:41.802
NOBODY'S GOING TO ASK YOU
TO WEAVE ANY BASKETS

06:41.835 --> 06:43.704
OR MAKE IT RAIN.

06:48.676 --> 06:51.144
SENSITIVE OPERATIONS UNIT.

06:51.178 --> 06:53.080
I WANT IT
CLOSED IN THREE DAYS.

07:18.506 --> 07:20.674
LEEVOY?

07:20.708 --> 07:21.809
LEVOI?
HOW DO YOU SAY IT?

07:21.842 --> 07:22.943
LEVOI.

07:22.976 --> 07:23.977
LEVOI.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.646
MR. COUTELLE.

07:25.679 --> 07:28.549
COOCH.

07:28.582 --> 07:31.151
ACTUALLY, WE MET BEFORE
IN '76 AT QUANTICO.

07:31.184 --> 07:32.753
I HEARD YOUR SPEECH
ON THE HOBBS ACT--

07:32.786 --> 07:34.722
LABOR RELATIONS.

07:34.755 --> 07:38.158
LOOK, WE GOT 87 MILES
TO THE RES.

07:38.191 --> 07:39.827
WE BETTER HIT IT.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.862
HOW MANY FIELD AGENTS
DO WE HAVE OUT THERE?

07:41.895 --> 07:44.698
IT'S JUST YOU AND ME
AND THE LONE PRAIRIE.

07:44.732 --> 07:45.899
WHO FOUND THE D.B.?

07:45.933 --> 07:47.701
NO NEED TO KNOW.

07:47.735 --> 07:50.771
THE ABORIGINAL RIGHTS MOVEMENT
SEEMS TO BE PRETTY ACTIVE.

07:50.804 --> 07:51.972
LOOK, UH, LEVOI...

07:53.974 --> 07:54.975
TURN YOUR HEAD
TO THE RIGHT

07:55.008 --> 07:56.243
FOR A SECOND.

07:57.845 --> 07:59.580
YOU KNOW,
IN THE RIGHT LIGHT

07:59.613 --> 08:00.881
WITH YOUR HEAD TURNED
LIKE THAT

08:00.914 --> 08:03.150
YOU KIND OF REMIND ME
OF SAL MINEO

08:03.183 --> 08:05.052
IN ARROWS ON THE PRAIRIE.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.654
OTHER THAN THAT

08:06.687 --> 08:09.122
YOUR COMING HERE IS LIKE
PISSING IN THE WIND

08:09.156 --> 08:10.558
SO DROP THE QUESTIONS.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.125
STICK TO THE ASSIGNMENT,
OKAY?

08:12.159 --> 08:13.561
WOULD YOU LIKE A SMOKE?

08:13.594 --> 08:14.962
I DON'T SMOKE.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.865
GOOD. THOSE THINGS
WILL KILL YOU.

08:51.064 --> 08:53.133
Cooch:
LOOK AT THIS.
WE HAVE A THIRD WORLD

08:53.166 --> 08:55.669
SLAPDAB IN THE MIDDLE
OF AMERICA.

08:55.703 --> 08:56.904
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE, HUH?

08:56.937 --> 09:00.240
USED TO BE ALL THEIRS
CLEAR ON UP INTO CANADA.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.676
THIS IS WHAT
THEY GOT LEFT WITH.

09:14.154 --> 09:16.724
JESUS.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.705
Ray:
THEY JUST LEFT
THE BODY OUT HERE?

09:31.739 --> 09:33.006
Cooch:
F.B.I. JURISDICTION.

09:33.040 --> 09:34.875
THE BODY BELONGS TO US.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.644
PHEW! RIPE ONE.

09:41.114 --> 09:42.382
LEO FAST ELK.

09:42.415 --> 09:45.719
NOT FAST ENOUGH,
I GUESS.

09:45.753 --> 09:47.320
"RAISED ON THE RESERVATION."

09:47.354 --> 09:48.722
KEY.

09:48.756 --> 09:49.923
"37. SINGLE.

09:49.957 --> 09:53.126
RESIDENT
OF COMMUNITY THREE HOUSING."

09:53.160 --> 09:55.262
THAT'S PENNY-ANTE STUFF, SAL.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.731
FIFTH MEMBER
OF THE TRIBAL COUNCIL.

09:57.765 --> 10:00.300
WHAT DO YOU MAKE
OF THE DAMAGES?

10:00.333 --> 10:02.803
AUTOMATIC.

10:02.836 --> 10:04.337
M-1, M-16.

10:04.371 --> 10:07.107
.223. HIGH VELOCITY.

10:07.140 --> 10:09.943
SOFT TIP, MAYBE.

10:11.679 --> 10:13.080
Cooch:
VERY CLINICAL.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.381
NOT THAT FANCY.

10:16.249 --> 10:19.052
IT'S A 30-30 LEVER ACTION.

10:19.086 --> 10:20.988
NO FRILLS.

10:21.021 --> 10:21.889
FIVE TIMES.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.258
MAYBE FIVE FEET AWAY.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.261
LET'S SPIRAL.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.197
WE WANT CASINGS.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.677
HERE YOU GO.

10:43.711 --> 10:45.946
EAGLE FEATHER
INSIDE A CIRCLE.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.915
THAT'S THE ARM SYMBOL.

10:47.948 --> 10:49.282
( engine revving )

11:19.312 --> 11:21.982
( flies buzzing )

11:30.157 --> 11:31.424
( gun cocking )

11:31.458 --> 11:32.860
Cooch:
FEDERAL OFFICER!

11:32.893 --> 11:34.461
HANDS ON YOUR HEAD!
DO IT!

11:39.299 --> 11:41.268
COME BACK
TO COVER YOUR TRACKS, PAL?

11:41.301 --> 11:43.036
LEO'S BEEN OUT HERE
TOO LONG.

11:43.070 --> 11:44.805
I'M TAKING HIM
TO CEREMONIAL BURIAL.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.173
THIS IS RESTRICTED AREA,
GERONIMO.

11:46.206 --> 11:47.407
IT'S INDIAN LAND.

11:47.440 --> 11:48.508
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

11:48.541 --> 11:49.843
EASY, SAL.

11:49.877 --> 11:51.211
AIN'T GERONIMO, CHIEF.

11:51.244 --> 11:52.312
MAYBE YOU GUYS

11:52.345 --> 11:54.114
GOT OFF THE WRONG EXIT.

11:54.147 --> 11:55.849
YOU LOOKING

11:55.883 --> 11:57.050
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

11:57.084 --> 12:00.253
I'M
A FULL-BLOODED OGLALA SIOUX.

12:00.287 --> 12:02.956
YOU'RE A MURDER SUSPECT,

12:14.034 --> 12:15.368
SHIT.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.437
SORRY ABOUT THAT, WALTER.

12:17.470 --> 12:21.041
HE'S NEW ON THE BLOCK,
KIND OF GUNG HO.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.343
Crow Horse:
YEAH, WE GOT WIND
YOU WAS COMING.

12:24.444 --> 12:26.379
THIS YOUR INDIAN

12:26.413 --> 12:28.315
YEAH. THIS IS RAY HERE.

12:28.348 --> 12:30.283

12:30.317 --> 12:31.184
LITTLE WEASEL?

12:31.218 --> 12:32.853

12:32.886 --> 12:34.054
YEAH, WELL, UH...

12:35.488 --> 12:37.357
LEO'S GOT TO GET
TO CEREMONY.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.326
GOT TO MAKE THE JOURNEY.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.461
WHAT JOURNEY?

12:41.494 --> 12:43.163
OH, THE JOURNEY.

12:43.196 --> 12:44.464
RIGHT.

12:44.497 --> 12:46.433
IT'S TIME.

12:46.466 --> 12:48.068
LOOK, CROW FOOT

12:48.101 --> 12:49.970
THE ONLY JOURNEY
LEO IS GOING TO MAKE

12:50.003 --> 12:52.139
IS TO THE MEDICAL EXAMINER
IN RAPID CITY.

12:52.172 --> 12:54.307
IN CASE YOU
DIDN'T KNOW IT, OFFICER

12:54.341 --> 12:56.243
VIOLATION
OF THE MAJOR CRIMES ACT...

12:56.276 --> 12:58.145
...ON AN INDIAN RESERVATION
IS WITHIN THE JURISDICTION

12:58.178 --> 13:00.047
OF THE FEDERAL BUREAU
OF INTIMIDATION.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.448
I KNOW THAT.

13:01.481 --> 13:03.183
THAT'S VERY GOOD.
NOW VAMOOSE.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.188
( speaking in Lakota )

13:08.221 --> 13:10.023
SORRY?

13:10.057 --> 13:11.992
YEAH, RIGHT.

13:12.025 --> 13:17.364
I SAID, UH, WHEN CAN LEO
BE TAKEN TO CEREMONY?

13:17.397 --> 13:19.900
WE'LL, UH, LET YOU KNOW.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.503
HAVE YOU KNOWN LEO LONG?

13:25.405 --> 13:27.307
NICE SHADES.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.548
Cooch:
THERE'S MORE HOMICIDE HERE

13:35.582 --> 13:37.985
THAN THE WHOLE REST
OF SOUTH DAKOTA.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.119
OVER WHAT?

13:39.152 --> 13:40.420
CIVIL WAR.

13:40.453 --> 13:42.489
YOU GOT THE SO-CALLED
TRADITIONALISTS MIXED UP

13:42.522 --> 13:45.092
WITH OUTSIDE AGITATORS--

13:45.125 --> 13:46.526
THEY WANT TO GO BACK
TO THE TEPEE

13:46.559 --> 13:48.395
AND THE BUFFALO HUNT--

13:48.428 --> 13:50.597
AGAINST THE PRO-GOVERNMENT
INDIANS.

13:50.630 --> 13:51.631
LIKE LEO FAST ELK.

13:51.664 --> 13:52.933

13:52.966 --> 13:54.134
YEAH.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.936
WELL, HE WAS A COUNCIL MEMBER

13:55.969 --> 13:57.905
SO OFFING HIM
WOULD BE A MAJOR COUP

13:57.938 --> 14:00.507
FOR THESE
MILITANT TRADITIONALISTS.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.076
THAT'S RIGHT.

14:03.110 --> 14:05.178
THEY WANT TO OVERTHROW
THE RESERVATION COUNCIL

14:05.212 --> 14:07.447
AND REINSTATE
THE OLD CHIEF SYSTEM

14:07.480 --> 14:10.083
AND THEN RECLAIM THE AMERICAS
ALL THE WAY FROM ALASKA

14:10.117 --> 14:13.386
DOWN TO ARGENTINA
OR SOME DAMN THING.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.522
WELL, IF THEY WANT
TO DO SOME GOOD

14:15.555 --> 14:18.591
THEY SHOULD
CLEAN UP THE GARBAGE
IN THEIR FRONT YARDS FIRST.

14:22.562 --> 14:25.432
Cooch:
NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF, RAY.

14:25.465 --> 14:26.666
THEY'RE YOUR OWN PEOPLE

14:26.699 --> 14:28.301
AREN'T THEY?

14:28.335 --> 14:30.203
THEY ARE NOT MY PEOPLE.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.244
WELL, JUST DON'T GO OVERBOARD
TRYING TO PROVE THAT POINT.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.179
I THOUGHT
YOU WERE GOING TO SNUFF

14:39.212 --> 14:40.513
OLD CROW HORSE BACK THERE.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.125
HEY, EASY NOW.

14:52.159 --> 14:53.260
JUST TAKE IT EASY.

15:00.968 --> 15:02.435
STAY CALM, CHIEF.

15:02.469 --> 15:04.004
JUST A ROAD INSPECTION.

15:08.275 --> 15:11.078
COUTELLE,
YOU FOUND YOUR WAY BACK.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.483
RAY, THIS IS JACK MILTON,
TRIBAL PRESIDENT.

15:16.516 --> 15:18.986
YOU'RE THE INDIAN OFFICIAL
THEY SENT US.

15:19.019 --> 15:20.187
THIS IS
RAY LITTLE...

15:20.220 --> 15:21.554
RAY LEVOI.

15:21.588 --> 15:23.323
MR. MILTON.

15:24.557 --> 15:26.293
HEY, HEY, HEY.

15:31.398 --> 15:32.599
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:35.402 --> 15:36.636
Milton:
THEY'RE TRADITIONALS.

15:36.669 --> 15:38.005
SUPPORTERS OF ARM.

15:38.005 --> 15:40.140
WE'RE LOOKING
FOR SOME PEOPLE.

15:40.173 --> 15:42.109
ARM LEFT THEIR MARK
AT THE BODY SITE.

15:42.142 --> 15:44.244
IT'S GONE TOO FAR
OUT HERE.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.613
WE'RE GOING TO CATCH
THESE MURDERERS

15:46.646 --> 15:48.715
AND TAKE CARE OF THEM
INDIAN WAY.

15:48.748 --> 15:50.517
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

15:50.550 --> 15:53.353
IT'S GOT TO BE TAKEN CARE OF
THE LEGAL WAY, JACK.

15:53.386 --> 15:55.322
FEDERAL JURISDICTION.

15:55.355 --> 15:58.491
ARE THESE
TRIBAL COPS?

15:58.525 --> 16:00.427
GUARDIANS
OF THE OGLALA NATION.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.395
GOONS FOR SHORT.

16:02.429 --> 16:05.165
TRIBAL RANGERS--
AUXILIARY SECURITY.

16:05.198 --> 16:09.069
THEY'VE BEEN EMPLOYED TO RUN
THESE SO-CALLED WARRIORS OFF.

16:09.102 --> 16:12.505
Cooch:
TELL THEM TO PUT
THEIR GUNS AWAY, JACK.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.274
THERE'S BEEN ENOUGH SHOOTING
AROUND HERE.

16:14.307 --> 16:15.442
COME ON.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.446
IF THE FEDERALS
DON'T GET RID OF THEM

16:19.479 --> 16:21.581
WE WILL.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.750
THE ARM IS GOING TO BE
THE BUSTED ARM.

16:23.783 --> 16:26.286
HEY, LOUIS.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.255
JUST SHUT UP
AND DO WHAT YOU'RE TOLD.

16:28.288 --> 16:29.656
MOVE ASIDE.

16:29.689 --> 16:31.591
CLEAR THE ROAD.

16:33.426 --> 16:36.096
I SAID DON'T MOVE.

16:36.129 --> 16:38.331
STAY IN THERE.

16:40.467 --> 16:42.535
WHERE THE HELL
DID THEY SEND US?

16:45.538 --> 16:47.440
A LONG WAY
FROM HOME, RAY.

16:57.317 --> 16:59.752
OKAY, NOW HERE'S THE DEAL.

16:59.786 --> 17:02.122
ARM'S ON
ITS LAST LEGS.

17:02.155 --> 17:05.358
MOST OF THEIR LEADERS
ARE IN JAIL OR DEAD.

17:05.392 --> 17:07.493
WE'VE GOT
TWO KEY EXTREMISTS LEFT.

17:07.527 --> 17:08.728
MAGGIE EAGLE BEAR.

17:08.761 --> 17:10.363
LOCAL SCHOOL TEACHER.

17:10.396 --> 17:12.165
CENTRAL.

17:12.199 --> 17:15.402
PROPENSITY FOR ARMED PROTEST,
INFLAMMATORY ACTS.

17:15.435 --> 17:18.204
OPENLY ADVOCATES
SYSTEMATIC VIOLENCE.

17:19.439 --> 17:20.772
THEN WE GOT...

17:20.807 --> 17:22.409
JIMMY.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.613
JAMES LOOKS TWICE.

17:28.681 --> 17:30.483
Cooch:
THE LAST MESSIAH
OF THE MOVEMENT.

17:30.517 --> 17:31.818
NATIONAL LEADER.

17:31.851 --> 17:34.754
FELONY RECORD?

17:34.787 --> 17:36.189
WELL, HE BURNED
THE AMERICAN FLAG

17:36.223 --> 17:37.324
THREE WEEKS AGO

17:37.357 --> 17:38.858
IN FRONT
OF THE COUNCIL OFFICES.

17:38.891 --> 17:42.162
PLEDGED TO OVERTHROW
MILTON'S GOONS.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.197
AFFIDAVITS?

17:45.598 --> 17:49.202
FIVE.

17:49.236 --> 17:51.471
PLUS WE GOT A DATA MATCH
BETWEEN HIM AND LEO FAST ELK.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.140
TWO ASSAULTS
LAST MONTH.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.543
HE'S MY DOER, RAY.

17:57.877 --> 17:59.879
NOW WHAT'S GOING
TO HAPPEN

17:59.912 --> 18:01.714
IS THIS AFTERNOON
WE'RE GOING

18:01.748 --> 18:05.385
INTO ONE OF
THEIR GUERILLA CAMPS
AND BUST HIS ASS.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.154
TWO ASSAULTS ON LEO?

18:07.187 --> 18:09.289
WELL...

18:09.322 --> 18:11.158
THREE.

18:13.360 --> 18:17.864
( chanting )

18:26.839 --> 18:27.774
WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

18:27.807 --> 18:28.875
SWEAT UNIT.

18:39.652 --> 18:40.853
ON THE GROUND.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.792
F.B.I., COME OUT EASY.

18:45.825 --> 18:47.360
( chanting stops )

18:52.365 --> 18:54.367
COME ON, GRANDPA,
MOVE IT.

18:56.336 --> 18:58.205
LET'S GO.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.708
( speaking Lakota )

19:01.741 --> 19:03.310
MOVE ALONG.

19:04.611 --> 19:06.413
F.B.I. AGENT.

19:06.446 --> 19:09.249
WE'LL DO THE TALKING.

19:09.282 --> 19:10.683
GO ON.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.754
MOVE IT,
MOVE IT.

19:14.787 --> 19:16.456
COME ON.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.791
MOVE IT.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.728
TURN AROUND
AND SHUT UP.

19:23.663 --> 19:24.831
OH, MAN.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.366
NICE HAIRCUT, JIMMY.

19:26.399 --> 19:28.301
THIS IS
A SPIRITUAL CEREMONY.

19:28.335 --> 19:29.836
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.771
YOU RESIST

19:31.804 --> 19:33.406
IT ALL GETS REAL SIMPLE
REAL FAST.

19:33.440 --> 19:36.543
YOU KNOW, SUBJECT RESISTED,
SUBJECT IS DEAD.

19:36.576 --> 19:40.647
WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF AN INIPI CEREMONY.

19:40.680 --> 19:42.315
YOU DRAG PEOPLE OUT
OF THEIR CHURCHES

19:42.349 --> 19:43.516
WHILE THEY'RE PRAYING?

19:43.550 --> 19:46.853
GET YOUR CLOTHES ON.

19:46.886 --> 19:50.657
GO ON HOME.

19:50.690 --> 19:53.960
Prisoner:
OKAY, OW, DON'T!

19:53.993 --> 19:55.695
( hawk screeches )

19:55.728 --> 19:57.264
Officer:
KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.834
GOT IT.

20:01.868 --> 20:03.336
MY TURN.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.716
Jimmy:
YOU GOT NOTHING ON ME.

20:16.749 --> 20:18.385
DON'T BE SO SURE,
JIMMY.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.520
HANGING THAT FLAG UPSIDE DOWN
IS A FEDERAL OFFENSE.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.589
I WAS IN
THE SERVICE, MAN.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.791
'NAM.

20:24.824 --> 20:26.659
DECORATED.

20:26.693 --> 20:28.595
YEAH, ME TOO, JIMMY.
YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

20:28.628 --> 20:29.962
THEN YOU SHOULD KNOW

20:29.996 --> 20:32.031
AN UPSIDE-DOWN FLAG'S
A DISTRESS SIGNAL.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.600
CUT THE MILITANT BULLSHIT.

20:33.633 --> 20:35.935
I'M NOT A MILITANT,
I'M A WARRIOR.

20:35.968 --> 20:37.570
AND I'M JOHN WAYNE.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.872
IT'S A 500-YEAR RESISTANCE.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.441
YOU CAN'T BREAK
THE CONNECTION.

20:42.542 --> 20:43.710
FOLLOW?

20:43.743 --> 20:45.044
IT'S A 500-YEAR-OLD
VOICE.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.314
HAVE YOU GOT
A KEY?

20:47.347 --> 20:50.450
ALL RIGHT.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.385
AGENT LEVOI,
THE FEDERAL
MASTER KEY, PLEASE.

20:52.419 --> 20:54.354
NO, DON'T.

20:54.387 --> 20:55.722
GOONS JUST BUSTED
MY DOOR SUNDAY.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.023
IT'S IN THE CAN.

20:57.056 --> 20:59.292
THE KEY.
USE THE KEY.

21:01.361 --> 21:02.995
IT'S IN
THE COFFEE CAN.

21:03.029 --> 21:05.432
COFFEE CAN.

21:05.465 --> 21:06.933
YEAH,
IN THE COFFEE CAN

21:06.966 --> 21:08.501
IN THE HOLE.

21:23.650 --> 21:24.884
( children screaming )

21:36.095 --> 21:37.597
Cooch:
ISSUE A FUGITIVE ALERT.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.732
ASSAULT
ON A FEDERAL OFFICER.

21:39.766 --> 21:41.768
Has the officer
been shot?

21:41.801 --> 21:44.003
NO, HE'S BEEN BIT
BY A FUCKING BADGER.

21:44.036 --> 21:46.072
( siren wailing )

22:26.045 --> 22:27.780
OKAY, OKAY!

22:27.814 --> 22:29.115
I SAID HOLD IT!

22:57.644 --> 22:58.545
( rustling )

23:25.237 --> 23:27.106
( child sobbing )

23:28.875 --> 23:31.110
Man:
GO THROUGH EVERYTHING.

23:33.212 --> 23:36.048
TURN AROUND,
KEEP YOUR HANDS ON THE WALL.

23:36.082 --> 23:37.950
WE KNOW JIMMY'S HERE.
WE KNOW YOU'RE HIDING HIM.

23:37.984 --> 23:40.720
GODDAMN GOONS,
GET THE FUCK
OFF MY PROPERTY.

23:40.753 --> 23:41.988
IF YOU WANT US
TO LEAVE, SCUM

23:42.021 --> 23:43.490
THEN TELL US
WHERE HE IS.

23:43.523 --> 23:44.924
( gunfire )

23:53.800 --> 23:55.502
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

23:55.535 --> 23:56.936
THIS IS A SCHOOL!
KNOCK IT OFF!

23:56.969 --> 23:59.706
THEY'RE NOT THE ENEMY.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.815
JIMMY HAVE ANY KIDS?

24:08.848 --> 24:10.950
YEAH, THREE,
AS FAR AS WE KNOW.

24:10.983 --> 24:13.252
MOVE IT, MOVE IT.

24:13.285 --> 24:15.722
YOU, GET OVER HERE.

24:15.755 --> 24:17.524
LEAVE HER ALONE.

24:24.230 --> 24:26.065
KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF ME.

24:26.098 --> 24:27.700
I'M GOING INSIDE.
I'VE GOT TO GET SOME THINGS.

24:43.616 --> 24:45.952
RAYMOND LEVOI LITTLE WIENER.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.554
FEDERAL BUREAU
OF INTERPRETATION.

24:47.587 --> 24:50.189
YOU SNUCK UP ON ME
JUST LIKE A REAL CITY INDIAN.

24:50.222 --> 24:52.024
YOU DON'T LISTEN SO GOOD,
DO YOU, CROW HORSE?

24:52.058 --> 24:55.862
WATCH IT. YOU'RE STEPPING
ON SIGN.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.797
LEO WASN'T KILLED HERE,
MAN.

24:57.830 --> 25:00.066
HE WAS DUMPED HERE.

25:00.099 --> 25:02.134
OUT OF A CAR.

25:02.168 --> 25:05.705
BALD TREAD, MUFFLER HELD ON
WITH BAILING WIRE.

25:05.738 --> 25:08.841
19 AND 60 CHEVROLET,
BLUE AND WHITE.

25:08.875 --> 25:11.578
LEO'S OWN CAR.
IT'S STILL MISSING.

25:14.781 --> 25:16.783
THE MAN YOU WANT

25:16.816 --> 25:19.218
DRAGGED LEO OUT
ON HIS BACK

25:19.251 --> 25:21.187
TURNED HIM FACE DOWN.

25:21.220 --> 25:24.156
MADE A CIRCLE IN THE EARTH
WITH A LODGEPOLE PINE BOUGH.

25:24.190 --> 25:26.593
DUSTED HIS PRINTS WITH IT
BACK TO LEO'S VEHICLE

25:26.593 --> 25:28.961
BUT HE MISSED ONE.

25:28.995 --> 25:32.131
WHOEVER KILLED LEO
WALKS HEEL-TOE.

25:32.164 --> 25:35.234
PLANTIGRADE.

25:35.267 --> 25:36.703
LIKE A WHITE MAN.

25:36.736 --> 25:38.638
JIMMY HAS
AN INDIAN WALK.

25:38.671 --> 25:40.907
CARRIES ABOUT 140 POUNDS.

25:40.940 --> 25:42.775
THIS GUY WAS A
BIG SON-OF-A-BUCK.

25:42.809 --> 25:44.777
BASED ON THE DEPTH
OF THAT PRINT

25:44.811 --> 25:48.247
I'D SAY
HE GOES 210, 215.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.850
HOW MUCH CHANGE DID
HE HAVE IN HIS POCKET?

25:50.883 --> 25:52.652
63 CENTS.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.357
YOU'RE OUT
OF YOUR JURISDICTION.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.793
LET'S GO.

26:00.827 --> 26:02.629
JURISDICTION'S
THE ONLY THING YOU GOT.

26:04.396 --> 26:06.833
YOU GOT TO LISTEN
TO THE TREES, HOSS.

26:06.866 --> 26:10.236
GOT TO STOP AND LISTEN
TO THE WIND.

26:10.269 --> 26:11.971
IT WILL
TELL YOU THINGS, KOLA.

26:12.004 --> 26:14.073
CROW HORSE,
I FLEW IN HERE

26:14.106 --> 26:17.109
FROM A PLACE CALLED
THE 20th CENTURY.

26:17.143 --> 26:20.079
I DON'T NEED TO LISTEN
TO THE TREES

26:20.112 --> 26:22.715
OR TALK TO THE SAND
TO GET ANSWERS.

26:24.984 --> 26:28.020
WELL, YOU GO BACK
TO THE M.E.

26:28.054 --> 26:30.189
AND TAKE A GOOD LOOK
INSIDE LEO'S WOUNDS

26:30.222 --> 26:32.659
AND YOU TELL ME HOW HE GOT
RED LIMESTONE IN THERE.

26:32.692 --> 26:34.060
YOU'LL ONLY FIND THAT

26:34.093 --> 26:36.195
AT THE BED
OF THE LITTLE WALKING RIVER.

26:36.228 --> 26:37.964
THAT'S WHERE
HE WAS KILLED

26:37.997 --> 26:40.066
WHERE SHE CROSSES
MAGGIE EAGLE BEAR'S PLACE.

26:42.168 --> 26:43.970
TELL 007 WHEN HE'S
STITCHED UP...

26:44.003 --> 26:45.171
WATCH YOUR MOUTH.

26:45.204 --> 26:47.006
YOU COULDN'T DUST
FRANK COUTELLE'S BADGE.

26:47.039 --> 26:49.275
OR HIS BADGER,
FOR THAT MATTER.

26:51.844 --> 26:54.013
YOU WEIGHT 173, HUH?

26:55.347 --> 26:57.249
YOU'RE NOT
A BEER DRINKER.

26:57.283 --> 26:59.719
YOU'RE ONE OF THESE
TOFU-AND-PILAF CHARACTERS.

26:59.752 --> 27:01.387
YOUR GUN'S
ON YOUR RIGHT HIP.

27:01.420 --> 27:02.955
YOU GOT A BACKUP.

27:02.989 --> 27:05.357
A LITTLE
.32, .38 MAYBE

27:05.391 --> 27:07.326
IN AN ANKLE HOLSTER.

27:07.359 --> 27:09.962
GIVES YOU A LEFT-FOOT DRAG.

27:09.996 --> 27:11.731
YOU'RE WEARING
BRAND-NEW SHOES

27:11.764 --> 27:13.299
THAT ARE A LITTLE TOO TIGHT
IN THE INSTEP

27:13.332 --> 27:15.201
BUT, MAN, THEY LOOK COOL,
AND THAT'S WHAT COUNTS.

27:15.234 --> 27:16.769
AM I RIGHT?

27:18.270 --> 27:20.039
CROW HORSE?

27:20.072 --> 27:22.709
FUCK YOU.

27:23.442 --> 27:25.077
LOVE TO.

27:53.439 --> 27:55.041
MA'AM?

27:57.109 --> 27:58.344
MA'AM, WAIT.

27:58.377 --> 28:01.180
I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU
FOR A MOMENT.

28:01.213 --> 28:02.148
( car approaching )

28:31.443 --> 28:35.081
WE'RE UNARMED.

28:35.114 --> 28:36.248
Ray:
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

28:36.282 --> 28:38.785
GRANDMA?
GRANDMA, YOU ALL RIGHT?

28:38.785 --> 28:41.020
I GAVE HER A LITTLE START.
SHE'S FINE.

28:41.053 --> 28:42.454
DON'T WORRY,
GRANDMA.

28:42.488 --> 28:43.923
WELL, WELL, WELL.

28:43.956 --> 28:45.157
THE WASHINGTON REDSKIN.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.097
YOU MUST BE
THE INDIAN F.B.I.

28:51.130 --> 28:53.165
THAT'S RIGHT.

28:53.199 --> 28:54.300
YOU LOOKING FOR JIMMY?

28:54.333 --> 28:55.802
HAVE YOU SEEN HIM?

28:55.802 --> 28:56.936
Child:
OKAY, YELLOW HAWK.

28:56.969 --> 28:58.971
Woman:
I THINK SO.

28:59.005 --> 29:02.274
HE CROSSED THE ROAD IN FRONT
OF ME ABOUT TWO MILES BACK

29:02.308 --> 29:04.310
AND THEN HE FLEW AWAY.

29:04.343 --> 29:05.845
HE FLEW AWAY?

29:05.878 --> 29:08.147
YEAH. HE CAN
SHAPE-SHIFT.

29:08.180 --> 29:09.415
SHAPE-SHIFT?

29:09.448 --> 29:11.350
INTO DIFFERENT ANIMALS.

29:11.383 --> 29:14.253
YOU KNOW.

29:14.286 --> 29:16.155
DEER, ELK, PORCUPINE.

29:16.188 --> 29:17.857
CROW, SOMETIMES.

29:19.826 --> 29:23.429
IS THAT A HEREDITARY THING,
OR CAN ONE TAKE CLASSES?

29:23.462 --> 29:25.998
GET OFF.

29:26.032 --> 29:27.499
TAKE HER IN,
TAKE HER IN.

29:27.533 --> 29:29.268
YOU LIVE HERE?

29:29.301 --> 29:30.536
WHY?

29:30.569 --> 29:31.838
NO, HE DOESN'T.

29:31.838 --> 29:33.472
WHERE WERE YOU
TWO DAYS AGO

29:33.505 --> 29:35.007
6:30 IN THE MORNING?

29:35.041 --> 29:36.843
YOU GOT A WARRANT?

29:36.876 --> 29:38.978
NO. YOU WANT TO TAKE
A DRIVE WITH ME

29:39.011 --> 29:40.512
OR TELL ME WHERE YOU WERE
TWO DAYS AGO?

29:40.546 --> 29:42.514
MOMMY, MOMMY!

29:42.548 --> 29:44.083
I WAS IN RAPID CITY.

29:46.518 --> 29:49.288
I HAD AN 8:00 INTERVIEW
WITH A TV REPORTER.

29:49.321 --> 29:52.391
DESECRATION
OF TRIBAL BURIAL GROUNDS.

29:52.424 --> 29:54.293
GO INSIDE.

29:54.326 --> 29:56.295
HE'S NOT GOING TO HURT YOU.

29:57.997 --> 30:00.199
THE CHILDREN WERE WITH ME.

30:00.232 --> 30:02.101
WE STOCKED UP
ON DRINKING WATER

30:02.134 --> 30:04.503
AND DROVE BACK
TO THE RES AROUND NOON.

30:04.536 --> 30:07.239
OKAY, AND THE OLD WOMAN
WAS WITH YOU?

30:07.273 --> 30:08.875
NO.

30:08.908 --> 30:10.542
WHY?

30:10.576 --> 30:12.178
I'D LIKE TO TALK TO HER.

30:12.211 --> 30:14.413
NO. SHE'S AFRAID
OF THE F.B.I.s.

30:14.446 --> 30:16.382
I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE

30:16.415 --> 30:18.450
A MURDER WAS COMMITTED
ON YOUR PROPERTY.

30:18.484 --> 30:20.286
I'M SURE
IF YOU JUST EXPLAIN

30:20.319 --> 30:22.621
THAT WE'RE HERE AS A SERVICE
TO THE COMMUNITY

30:22.654 --> 30:24.356
SHE'LL COOPERATE.

30:24.390 --> 30:26.926
SHE DOESN'T TALK
TO WASI'CUS.

30:29.461 --> 30:30.963
BUT THEN, YOU'RE INDIAN.

30:30.997 --> 30:32.498
THAT'S CORRECT.

30:32.531 --> 30:34.200
HMM. WHAT NATION?

30:34.233 --> 30:35.601
THE UNITED STATES.

30:38.570 --> 30:40.006
HMPH.

30:40.039 --> 30:41.207
I'M A SIOUX.

30:43.309 --> 30:45.978
WHO DO YOU GET
YOUR BLOOD FROM?

30:46.012 --> 30:47.880
WHO'S YOUR FATHER?
I, UH...

30:49.081 --> 30:51.217
LOOK. THIS REALLY
DOESN'T MATTER, DOES IT?

30:51.250 --> 30:54.320
GRANDMA'S VERY,
VERY TRADITIONAL.

30:54.353 --> 30:55.454
I DON'T THINK
SHE'LL UNDERSTAND.

30:55.487 --> 30:56.989
I'M TRADITIONAL TOO.

30:57.023 --> 30:58.891
BRING HER OUT.

30:58.925 --> 30:59.959
SHE CAN EXPLAIN
SHAPE-SHIFTING.

30:59.992 --> 31:02.361
I'LL EXPLAIN
THE AIRPLANE.

31:02.394 --> 31:03.229
YOU'RE FROM
THE RESERVATION...

31:03.262 --> 31:04.563
YOU ASSHOLE.

31:04.596 --> 31:06.598
I'M FROM MINNEAPOLIS.

31:06.632 --> 31:08.134
I SPENT FOUR
YEARS AT DARTMOUTH
BEFORE I CAME BACK.

31:08.167 --> 31:11.270
I KNOW MY RIGHTS
AND I KNOW YOUR WORLD.

31:11.303 --> 31:13.472
GRANDMA'S NOT COMING OUT
UNLESS YOU'VE GOT A WARRANT

31:13.505 --> 31:16.943
AND YOU'RE TRESPASSING,
SO HIT THE ROAD, CHIEF.

31:25.651 --> 31:27.286
( hawk screeches )

31:46.172 --> 31:47.673
Ray:
"S.A. COUTELLE

31:47.706 --> 31:49.408
"APPREHENDED LOOKS TWICE

BUT WERE ATTACKED... "

31:50.676 --> 31:51.978
Cooch:
AMBUSHED.

31:51.978 --> 31:53.712
AMBUSHED. THAT'S GOOD.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.414
"...AMBUSHED BY FIVE... "

31:55.447 --> 31:56.682

32:17.536 --> 32:19.105
I WANT TO NAIL
THIS SON OF A BITCH

32:19.138 --> 32:21.173
BEFORE THAT 302
REACHES DAWES.

32:21.207 --> 32:23.575
OUR THREE DAYS
AREN'T UP YET.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.044
DID YOU GET
ANYTHING OUT THERE?

32:29.715 --> 32:31.550
Bartender:
LISTEN, I THINK IT'S TIME
YOU GOT HOME.

32:31.583 --> 32:32.751
Customer:
I WANT ONE MORE DRINK.

32:32.784 --> 32:35.521
.223 M-16.

32:35.554 --> 32:37.523
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

32:37.556 --> 32:39.691
PROPERTY
OF MAGGIE EAGLE BEAR'S.

32:39.725 --> 32:41.193
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME!

32:41.227 --> 32:42.561

GET OUT OF HERE!
LET'S GO!

32:47.599 --> 32:49.268
YEAH, AND..?

32:49.301 --> 32:52.038
THERE'S SUBSTANTIAL
EVIDENCE THERE

32:52.038 --> 32:54.140
TO INDICATE
THAT'S THE MURDER SITE.

32:54.173 --> 32:56.275
THIS LOOKS TWICE FELLOW
IS VERY SLOPPY.

32:56.308 --> 32:57.709
HOW DID YOU GET THIS?

32:57.743 --> 32:59.378
FRATERNIZING.

32:59.411 --> 33:01.113
WHO?

33:01.147 --> 33:02.714
THE INDIAN COP, CROW HORSE.

33:04.450 --> 33:07.419
YOU'RE BARKING UP
THE WRONG TREE, RAY.

33:07.453 --> 33:10.622
HE PLAYS WITH F.B.I. HEADS.
THAT'S HIS M.O.

33:10.656 --> 33:13.425
HE'S GOT NO JURISDICTION.

33:13.459 --> 33:15.427
CRYSTAL CLEAR,
BUT IT HAPPENED THERE.

33:15.461 --> 33:18.564
THE D.B. WAS TRANSPORTED
IN HIS OWN VEHICLE,
A '60 CHEVY.

33:18.597 --> 33:22.068
IF WE FIND THAT VEHICLE,
WE'LL HAVE
THE EVIDENCE WE NEED.

33:22.101 --> 33:24.336
WAS ANYBODY AT HER CAMP?

33:24.370 --> 33:27.506
SHE WAS. SIX KIDS.
TWO OF THEM ARE HERS.

33:27.539 --> 33:29.608
UH, THANK YOU.

33:29.641 --> 33:31.477
AN OLD LADY
SHE CALLED GRANDMA

33:31.510 --> 33:37.116
AND AN ARM MEMBER,
RICHARD, LAST NAME UNKNOWN.

33:37.149 --> 33:38.384
WHEELCHAIR?

33:38.417 --> 33:39.451
MM-HMM.

33:39.485 --> 33:41.387
YEAH. RICHARD YELLOW HAWK.

33:41.420 --> 33:43.222
YELLOW HAWK.

33:43.255 --> 33:45.124
( pencil scratching )

33:45.157 --> 33:47.193
LET'S HEAR THE TAPE ON MAGGIE.

33:49.161 --> 33:51.263
I DIDN'T GET TAPE.

33:51.297 --> 33:52.698
WE'RE TRYING
TO BUILD A CASE.

33:52.731 --> 33:54.733
GET TAPE, ALL RIGHT?

33:54.766 --> 33:57.803
IF WE DON'T NAIL THIS
IN 24 HOURS

33:57.836 --> 34:00.172
IT'S NO LONGER
AN IN-AND-OUT.

34:00.206 --> 34:02.574
YOU'RE GOING TO BE EATING
FRIED BREAD AND DOG SOUP

34:02.608 --> 34:04.710
FOR MANY MOONS, RAY.

34:04.743 --> 34:07.713
NOW GET THE FUCK OUT THERE AND
GET THE TRADITIONALS TALKING.
THEY'RE HIDING HIM.

34:07.746 --> 34:10.116
HOW ABOUT A REAL JOB?
NOBODY'S GOING TO TALK TO ME.

34:10.149 --> 34:11.550
( glass breaking )

34:29.201 --> 34:32.371
GODDAMNED PRAIRIE NIGGERS!

34:35.841 --> 34:38.244
WHAT'S ALL
THE SHOOTING ABOUT?

34:43.614 --> 34:44.783
LOOK, SOMEBODY'S
TRYING TO TELL US

34:44.815 --> 34:46.217
IT'S CHECKOUT TIME.

35:04.270 --> 35:06.205
( siren wailing )

35:20.319 --> 35:22.554
YOU GOT TO BE
KIDDING ME.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.759
LICENSE AND REGISTRATION,
PLEASE, SIR.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.761
KISS MY ASS.

35:29.795 --> 35:33.665
HEY, THIS IS MY JURISDICTION,
AND YOU WERE DOING 59 IN A 55.

35:33.699 --> 35:35.467
LET ME SEE THE RADAR.

35:35.501 --> 35:36.535
I DON'T NEED NO RADAR.

35:36.568 --> 35:37.703
I CAN TELL.

35:37.736 --> 35:39.571
YOU'RE SO FULL OF SHIT.

35:39.605 --> 35:41.240
NO. I LISTENED TO THE WIND
WHEN YOU WENT BY.

35:41.273 --> 35:44.910
IT SAID, "59. NAIL HIM...

35:44.943 --> 35:47.946
BEFORE THE TRADITIONALS DO."

35:47.979 --> 35:52.284
YOU KNOW, YOU GUYS ARE JUST
THE SECOND COMING

35:52.318 --> 35:54.486
OF THE SAME OLD CAVALRY.

35:54.520 --> 35:56.522
THEY DON'T WANT YOU HERE.

35:56.555 --> 35:58.524
AIN'T NOBODY
GOING TO TALK TO YOU.

35:58.557 --> 36:00.826
FINE.

36:00.859 --> 36:02.761
EXCEPT FOR
THE WICA'SA WAKAN

36:02.794 --> 36:04.496
AND I DON'T KNOW WHY.

36:04.530 --> 36:05.931
THE WHO?

36:05.964 --> 36:07.966
THE MAN WHO SENT ME
TO FIND YOU.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.669
SAYS HE HAS
SOME INFORMATION

36:10.702 --> 36:12.904
FOR THE F.B.I.

36:12.938 --> 36:15.407
WELL, WHERE IS HE?

36:15.441 --> 36:17.576
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN MAIL
THAT PUPPY IN

36:17.609 --> 36:18.944
OR YOU CAN APPEAR
AT TRIBAL COURT

36:18.977 --> 36:20.446
IF YOU WISH
TO CONTEST IT.

36:20.479 --> 36:21.813
FOLLOW ME.

36:46.372 --> 36:47.973
GRANDPA SAMUEL REACHES.

36:48.006 --> 36:50.342
HEAVY-DUTY MEDICINE.

36:50.376 --> 36:51.943
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
MEDICINE?

36:51.977 --> 36:53.945
LIKE A MEDICINE MAN?

36:53.979 --> 36:55.381
YEAH.

36:55.414 --> 36:56.448
DID YOU BRING
SOME TOBACCO?

36:56.482 --> 36:57.516
WHAT?

37:00.852 --> 37:02.621
WHEN YOU GO AND VISIT
AN ELDER

37:02.654 --> 37:04.390
YOU ALWAYS BRING
SOME TOBACCO

37:04.423 --> 37:05.824
AS A GIFT.

37:05.857 --> 37:07.293
I KNEW THAT.

37:09.761 --> 37:10.996
YEAH, RIGHT.

37:17.336 --> 37:18.604
Come on, Waldo.

37:18.637 --> 37:21.473
Get onto your skis.

37:21.507 --> 37:26.312
( Reaches speaking Lakota )

37:29.781 --> 37:31.317
WHAT DID HE SAY?

37:33.084 --> 37:34.786
HE, UH...

37:34.820 --> 37:37.323
HE WANTS TO KNOW
IF YOU EVER WATCH MR. MAGOO.

37:37.323 --> 37:40.326
HE SAYS
HE'S NOT TO BE TRUSTED.

37:40.359 --> 37:41.660
HE'S CRAZY.

37:41.693 --> 37:45.531
( speaking Lakota )

37:45.564 --> 37:47.399
HE SAYS MAGOO NEEDS TO GO UP
ON THE MOUNTAIN

37:47.433 --> 37:49.335
AND GET HIMSELF FOCUSED.

37:57.943 --> 38:00.412
UH...

38:00.446 --> 38:01.880
GRANDPA LIKES TO TRADE.

38:01.913 --> 38:03.048
HMM?

38:03.081 --> 38:04.983
NOBODY STOPS BY HERE

38:05.016 --> 38:06.952
WITHOUT GETTING STUCK
IN THE OLD INDIAN BARTER.

38:06.985 --> 38:08.787
KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

38:11.723 --> 38:13.892
HE LIKES
YOUR EYEGLASSES.

38:16.061 --> 38:17.496
AHEM.

38:27.539 --> 38:29.508
( Crow Horse laughing )

38:41.720 --> 38:44.523
HE SAYS YOU STOPPED THE INIPI
TWO DAYS AGO.

38:44.556 --> 38:46.925
HE'S NOT UNHAPPY WITH YOU,
BECAUSE HE SAYS HE KNOWS YOU.

38:46.958 --> 38:48.960
HE KNOWS ME?

38:48.994 --> 38:52.831
HE SAYS HE SAW YOU
IN A VISION SOME TIME BACK.

38:52.864 --> 38:55.434
( speaking Lakota )

38:59.871 --> 39:03.542
HE SAYS YOU COME
FROM A WASI'CU
CITY IN THE EAST

39:03.575 --> 39:07.145
BUT YOUR PEOPLE, WAY BACK,
ARE THE MINNICONJOU SIOUX.

39:07.178 --> 39:08.747
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT

39:08.780 --> 39:10.816
BECAUSE YOU'RE AS FAR
FROM YOURSELF

39:10.849 --> 39:12.484
AS A HAWK
FROM THE MOON.

39:12.518 --> 39:16.054
HE WAS TOLD YOU WERE COMING.

39:16.087 --> 39:17.423
WHO TOLD HIM?

39:18.757 --> 39:20.426
SPIRITS.

39:22.694 --> 39:25.431
IT'S THEIR WILL
THAT YOU COME HERE.

39:31.570 --> 39:32.704
SO WE WILL SMOKE THE PIPE

39:32.738 --> 39:34.606
AND THERE WILL BE
NO LIES BETWEEN US.

39:46.184 --> 39:47.753
DON'T WORRY, RAY.

39:47.786 --> 39:49.054
IT AIN'T NO
MEXICAN AGRICULTURE.

39:49.087 --> 39:50.789
TOBACCO OFFERING.

39:50.822 --> 39:51.957
THE SMOKE WILL CARRY
YOUR PRAYERS UP.

39:51.990 --> 39:53.659
IF YOU DON'T SMOKE

39:53.692 --> 39:56.528
HE'LL THINK
YOU'RE HIDING SOMETHING.

40:07.639 --> 40:09.808
( speaking Lakota )

40:11.743 --> 40:13.579
VERY SACRED, HE SAYS.

40:13.612 --> 40:18.216
500 YEARS 0LD
TURTLE SHELL RATTLE.

40:18.249 --> 40:20.752
HANDED DOWN FROM
FOUR GRANDFATHERS.

40:20.786 --> 40:23.589
POWERFUL.

40:24.189 --> 40:25.891
I SEE A MAN--

40:25.924 --> 40:27.626
HALF INDIAN.

40:27.659 --> 40:30.462
HE'S IN DIRTY CLOTHES,
BAD TEETH

40:30.496 --> 40:32.097
STANDING NEAR
A MISSION...

40:32.130 --> 40:34.566
NO, A SCHOOL.

40:34.600 --> 40:36.735
HE'S WAITING
FOR SOMEBODY.

40:36.768 --> 40:39.938
A BOY
LEAVES THE SCHOOL.

40:39.971 --> 40:43.709
OTHER WASI'CUS BOYS PLAYING
LIKE BOYS DO.

40:43.742 --> 40:46.778
THE BOY SEES
THE INDIAN MAN WAITING

40:46.812 --> 40:48.780
BUT THE OTHER BOYS
ARE LAUGHING

40:48.814 --> 40:51.483
AND MAKING NAMES
AT THE INDIAN MAN

40:54.219 --> 40:57.022
AND HIS BOY PRETENDS
HIS EYES DO NOT SEE HIM

40:57.055 --> 40:59.691
AND HE RUNS PAST HIM.

40:59.725 --> 41:02.227
THE INDIAN MAN STANDS ALONE...

41:03.028 --> 41:04.162
SAD.

41:04.195 --> 41:06.598
THIS INDIAN MAN

41:06.632 --> 41:08.233
WITH DIRTY CLOTHES
AND BAD TEETH

41:08.266 --> 41:09.935
IS SOMEWHERE ELSE.

41:09.968 --> 41:11.136
HE'S ON A FLOOR.

41:11.169 --> 41:13.572
YEAH, ON A FLOOR.

41:19.645 --> 41:20.679
( gasping )

41:20.712 --> 41:22.548
HE CAN'T BREATHE.

41:22.548 --> 41:25.651
HE CANNOT... BREATHE.

41:34.860 --> 41:37.963
DOES HE HAVE ANY
IN...
IN... INFORMATION OR NOT?

41:40.331 --> 41:42.568
HE GAVE IT TO YOU.

41:47.205 --> 41:50.576
ASK HIM, UH, IF HE KNOWS
ANYTHING ABOUT THE MURDER.

42:11.029 --> 42:13.098
WELL?

42:13.131 --> 42:16.301
HE SAID,
"I DON'T KNOW."

42:25.276 --> 42:28.079
HE WAS RECITING
THE GETTYSBURG ADDRESS
IN THERE.

42:28.113 --> 42:29.114
NOW WHAT
WAS HE SAYING?

42:29.147 --> 42:30.616
( sighing )

42:32.317 --> 42:34.252
THE OLD MAN SAW
AN OWL LAST WEEK.

42:34.285 --> 42:36.121
SO WHAT?

42:36.154 --> 42:38.624
THE OWL IS A MESSENGER.

42:38.657 --> 42:40.125
IT MEANS
SOMEBODY'S GOING TO DIE.

42:40.158 --> 42:42.327
THE OWL TOLD HIM
ABOUT LEO.

42:42.360 --> 42:44.830
THE OWL TOLD HIM
ABOUT LEO.

42:44.863 --> 42:48.133
HE ALSO SAID,
"LISTEN TO THE WATER."

42:48.166 --> 42:50.869
LISTEN TO THE WATER.

42:50.902 --> 42:53.739
LISTEN TO THE OWL.

42:53.772 --> 42:57.142
HE ALSO SAID,
"DON'T TRUST MR. MAGOO."

42:57.175 --> 42:59.177
HE SAID YOU'RE CHASING
THE WRONG MAN.

42:59.210 --> 43:01.146
JIMMY DIDN'T DO IT.

43:01.179 --> 43:03.348
HE SAID
WE SHOULD FOLLOW THIS.

43:03.381 --> 43:05.651
FOLLOW THIS.

43:07.753 --> 43:09.921
THE BEST PART OF HIS LIFE
A MEDICINE MAN

43:09.955 --> 43:12.090
COMMUNING WITH THE EARTH.

43:12.123 --> 43:13.391
HE CAN READ YOU

43:13.424 --> 43:15.293
LIKE LAST MONTH'S
SEARS CATALOG, KOLA.

43:15.326 --> 43:18.697
( Reaches laughing )

43:56.935 --> 43:58.704
HELLO.

44:00.371 --> 44:01.973
HELLO.

44:02.007 --> 44:04.175
OH, HELLO.

44:04.209 --> 44:06.912
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

44:07.979 --> 44:11.149
( speaking Lakota )

44:11.182 --> 44:14.720
GRANDPA REACHES SAYS YOU COME
FROM HEAVY INDIAN BLOOD.

44:14.753 --> 44:16.822
YOU TRYING TO MANIPULATE
AN OLD MAN NOW?

44:16.855 --> 44:18.223
IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

44:18.256 --> 44:20.759
THESE ARE FOR YOU.

44:24.495 --> 44:27.032
GRANDMA WANTS TO KNOW

44:27.065 --> 44:29.801
IF YOU'D LIKE TO COME IN
FOR A CUP OF WAKALAPI.

44:29.835 --> 44:32.971
LOVE ONE.

44:33.004 --> 44:35.807
THERE'S BEEN A LOT
OF TROUBLE AROUND HERE.

44:35.841 --> 44:37.475
YES. I HEAR THE GUNSHOT.

44:37.508 --> 44:39.210
WHEN?

44:39.244 --> 44:41.046
EVERY NIGHT.

44:41.079 --> 44:42.848
I JUST SIT
IN MY CHAIR AND PRAY

44:42.881 --> 44:44.850
TUNKASILA WILL HELP US.

44:44.883 --> 44:47.452
BUT IT'S THE WATER,
THE CHILDREN GETTING SICK.

44:47.485 --> 44:49.454
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

44:49.487 --> 44:50.756
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE WATER?

44:50.789 --> 44:52.758
IT'S CONTAMINATED.

44:52.791 --> 44:54.259
RANCHERS ARE FINDING
STILLBORN CALVES

44:54.292 --> 44:55.994
ALL OVER THE RES.

44:56.027 --> 44:57.929
GRANDMA, DO YOU REMEMBER

44:57.963 --> 44:59.330
THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW LEO FAST ELK?

44:59.364 --> 45:02.000
I'VE GOT SOMETHING.

45:04.335 --> 45:06.805
( speaking Lakota )

45:09.007 --> 45:10.475
WHY DON'T YOU
LEAVE HER ALONE?

45:10.508 --> 45:12.778
SHE DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

45:12.778 --> 45:15.513
A MAN WAS MURDERED HERE.
IT'S MY JOB.

45:15.546 --> 45:17.282
ALL RIGHT.

45:22.287 --> 45:24.189
DO YOUR JOB.

45:24.222 --> 45:26.424
61 TRADITIONALS
AND ARM SUPPORTERS

45:26.457 --> 45:28.794
WHO WERE MURDERED
AND NEVER INVESTIGATED.

45:28.827 --> 45:30.796
OH, YOU DON'T WANT
THIS ONE.

45:30.796 --> 45:32.330
THIS IS A SUICIDE.

45:32.363 --> 45:35.801
SOMEHOW HE SHOT HIMSELF
IN THE BACK OF THE HEAD.

45:35.834 --> 45:37.535
I'LL LOOK INTO IT, MAGGIE.

45:37.568 --> 45:39.871
WHY DON'T YOU ALSO FIND OUT

45:39.905 --> 45:42.841
WHAT HAPPENS TO TRIBAL FUNDS
THAT DON'T GET
PAST JACK MILTON.

45:42.874 --> 45:45.811
STOP PRETENDING THAT
YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON.

45:45.811 --> 45:47.545
I KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

45:47.578 --> 45:49.314
YOU'RE TRYING TO USE

45:49.347 --> 45:50.816
YOUR HONORS DEGREE
IN EDUCATION FROM DARTMOUTH

45:50.816 --> 45:52.317
TO HELP YOUR PEOPLE.

45:52.350 --> 45:55.286
YOU ORGANIZED
THE LOCAL CONTROL OF SCHOOLS.

45:55.320 --> 46:00.491
THEN YOU CO-FOUNDED THE OGLALA
BATTERED WOMEN'S SHELTER

46:00.525 --> 46:02.193
A COUPLE OF MONTHS
AFTER YOU WERE RAPED.

46:04.229 --> 46:07.032
YOU'RE CONSIDERED
ONE OF THE MOST

46:07.065 --> 46:08.566
EFFECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES
OF ARM WITH THE MEDIA

46:08.599 --> 46:11.202
EVEN THOUGH YOU CONSISTENTLY
VOTE AGAINST VIOLENT ACTION.

46:12.203 --> 46:16.141
THAT MUST BE HARD.

46:16.174 --> 46:18.376
YOU DO A LOT
OF GOOD WORK, MAGGIE.

46:18.409 --> 46:20.411
YOU'RE VERY BRAVE.

46:20.445 --> 46:22.413
YOU WANT TO KEEP DOING IT?

46:30.121 --> 46:33.324
( speaking Lakota )

46:37.963 --> 46:40.331
SHE SAYS SHE
MADE THAT FOR YOU.

46:43.101 --> 46:46.271
SHE SAID GRANDPA REACHES
TOLD HER YOU COME FROM...

46:46.304 --> 46:49.074
BRAVE PEOPLE.

47:03.989 --> 47:05.223
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

47:06.291 --> 47:07.959
Maggie:
GET OFF OF ME!

47:07.993 --> 47:11.296
GET OFF!
GET DOWN! GET DOWN!

47:11.329 --> 47:14.232
( girl screaming )

47:19.204 --> 47:21.006
MOMMY! MOMMY! MOMMY!

47:21.039 --> 47:22.173
STAY DOWN!

47:22.207 --> 47:24.175
Maggie:
GET DOWN!

47:24.209 --> 47:25.343
( gunshot )

47:25.376 --> 47:26.912
( screaming )

47:27.645 --> 47:30.315
MOMMY!

47:30.348 --> 47:31.516
OH, GOD!

47:31.549 --> 47:33.118
HOBART! HOBART!

47:33.151 --> 47:34.319
OH, MY GOD!

47:34.352 --> 47:36.922
HE'S BEEN SHOT!
HE'S BEEN SHOT!

47:38.123 --> 47:41.292
( yelling )

47:41.326 --> 47:43.061
THEY SHOT HIM.

47:43.094 --> 47:45.396
HELP ME.
THEY SHOT HIM.

47:45.430 --> 47:46.331
LET ME TAKE HIM.

47:46.364 --> 47:48.033
MY BABY.

47:48.066 --> 47:49.134
TAKE HIS HEAD.

47:49.167 --> 47:50.468
TAKE HIS HEAD.

47:57.642 --> 47:59.210
WHERE'S THE HOSPITAL?

47:59.244 --> 48:00.478
QUICK!

48:00.511 --> 48:01.479
MAIN VILLAGE!

48:08.954 --> 48:11.589
SHOOTING AT
EAGLE BEAR RESIDENCE
IN MATO SKA.

48:11.622 --> 48:13.491
HE WON'T STOP BLEEDING!

48:13.524 --> 48:15.593
HE WON'T STOP BLEEDING!

48:15.626 --> 48:17.996
WRAP THAT AROUND HIM,
AND DON'T PUT IT ON TOO TIGHT.

48:19.397 --> 48:22.333
I HAVE AN INJURED CHILD
EN ROUTE

48:22.367 --> 48:24.635
TO THE RESERVATION
HEALTH CLINIC. OVER.

48:24.669 --> 48:26.637
HE'S GOING TO BE
ALL RIGHT.

48:26.671 --> 48:28.974
STAY AWAKE WITH ME, NOW.

48:34.579 --> 48:36.247
( horn honking )

48:42.753 --> 48:43.654
MY SON'S BEEN SHOT!

48:43.688 --> 48:44.990
WE NEED ANOTHER TABLE.

48:44.990 --> 48:46.157
THERE IS NO OTHER TABLE.

48:46.191 --> 48:47.258
WE NEED ANOTHER TABLE!

48:47.292 --> 48:48.493
HOLD ON.

48:48.526 --> 48:50.195
HOLD HIS HEAD.

48:54.099 --> 48:56.634
HE'S LOST A LOT OF BLOOD.
COME ON.

48:56.667 --> 48:58.003
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

48:58.036 --> 48:59.304
HE'S NOT GOING
TO DIE.

48:59.337 --> 49:01.206
HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

49:01.239 --> 49:03.441
LET ME TAKE A LOOK.
WHAT HAPPENED?

49:03.474 --> 49:05.410
HE'S BEEN SHOT.

49:05.443 --> 49:06.411
WHAT'S HIS NAME?

49:06.444 --> 49:07.678
HOBART.

49:07.712 --> 49:10.148
( laughing )

49:10.181 --> 49:11.382
WHOA!

49:11.416 --> 49:12.383
YEAH!

49:12.417 --> 49:14.119
WHOO!

49:14.152 --> 49:15.253
BREATHE IN AND OUT
AS BIG AS YOU CAN.

49:15.286 --> 49:18.123
HE'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT.

49:23.228 --> 49:25.096
I GOT SOME COLD ONES
UP HERE IN FRONT.

49:26.064 --> 49:27.198
I'LL TAKE ONE.

49:27.232 --> 49:28.166
HERE YOU GO.

49:39.644 --> 49:41.212
( gunshot )

49:41.246 --> 49:42.513
( snapping )

49:42.547 --> 49:43.581
( screaming )

49:48.453 --> 49:50.055
( horn honking )

49:54.159 --> 49:55.226
NO.
WERE YOU HIT?

49:56.694 --> 49:58.596
ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR FUCKING MIND?

49:58.629 --> 50:00.265
I TOLD YOU
EAGLE BEAR WAS KEY.

50:00.298 --> 50:02.467
NOW THE ARM PEOPLE THINK
SHE'S AN INFORMANT.

50:02.500 --> 50:04.202
THAT WASN'T ARM.

50:04.235 --> 50:06.804
YOU BETTER KEEP YOUR BOY
ON A LEASH!

50:06.837 --> 50:08.539
YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT NEEDS A FUCKING LEASH!

50:08.573 --> 50:11.476
THESE GUYS ARE ON OUR TEAM.

50:11.509 --> 50:13.244
YOU SET OFF A POWDER KEG.

50:14.679 --> 50:16.714
I TOLD YOU
NOT TO GO THERE.

50:16.747 --> 50:18.383
YOU GETTING HORNY
OR SOMETHING?

50:18.416 --> 50:19.684
SHOOTING FOR RANK?

50:19.717 --> 50:21.352
I DON'T GIVE TWO SHITS
WHAT WENT ON

50:21.386 --> 50:23.354
BETWEEN YOU AND DAWES
IN D.C.

50:23.388 --> 50:27.058
THIS IS THE BATTLEFIELD,
AND THIS IS MY CASE.

50:27.092 --> 50:29.760
( hooting and hollering )

50:29.794 --> 50:32.063
GET IN THE FUCKING CAR.

50:38.503 --> 50:39.337
Milton:
LET'S GET ON
OUT OF HERE.

50:50.715 --> 50:52.850
WE JUST GOT THE LAB REPORT

50:52.883 --> 50:54.452
ON THAT EAGLE
FEATHER YOU FOUND
IN THE TRAILER AT JIMMY'S.

50:54.485 --> 50:56.387
IT'S A GENETIC DITTO

50:56.421 --> 50:58.156
TO THE ONE FOUND
AT THE D.B. SITE.

50:58.189 --> 50:59.857
STICK TO THE ASSIGNMENT, PAL.

50:59.890 --> 51:01.459
SENSITIVE OPERATIONS UNIT.

51:01.492 --> 51:02.560
VERY GOOD.

51:06.197 --> 51:08.233
WELL, LET'S JUST CATCH
THIS TONTO AND
GET OUT OF HERE.

51:10.868 --> 51:13.204
YOU FILLED OUT A 302
THIS MORNING.

51:13.238 --> 51:14.572
SUBJECT--
INDIAN MALE, ELDERLY.

51:14.605 --> 51:15.840
SAMUEL REACHES.

51:15.873 --> 51:17.575
HE AIN'T ELDERLY, COOCH.

51:17.608 --> 51:18.776
PETRIFIED.

51:18.809 --> 51:20.878
IT'S JUST BULLSHIT.

51:20.911 --> 51:22.680
NOT EXACTLY.

51:22.713 --> 51:24.149
THE OLD MAN'S
A SPIRITUAL LEADER OF ARM.

51:24.182 --> 51:25.783
THEY ALL GO TO HIM

51:25.816 --> 51:27.385
TO GET THEIR SEMIAUTOMATICS
BLESSED OR SOMETHING.

51:27.418 --> 51:30.288
I WANT YOU TO CODE FIVE
AT HIS RESIDENCE.

51:32.357 --> 51:35.726
LOOK, UM... COOCH...

51:35.760 --> 51:37.762
HEY, LOOK, LET'S GET
BACK ON TRACK HERE.

51:39.230 --> 51:41.432
THE HEAT'S COMING DOWN
ON JIMMY

51:41.466 --> 51:43.201
AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS,
HE GOES TO GET HOLY.

51:43.234 --> 51:45.703
NOW GET YOURSELF
A COLD SHOWER

51:45.736 --> 51:47.638
AND GET ON OVER THERE.

52:24.842 --> 52:26.344
( dog whining )

52:35.453 --> 52:38.789
JAMES LOOKS TWICE...
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

52:41.392 --> 52:42.727
SHAPE-SHIFT,
YOU CAN HAVE SOME MILK.

52:42.760 --> 52:44.295
( whining )

52:52.570 --> 52:54.339
JUST CHECKING.

53:19.597 --> 53:21.799
( sighing )

53:36.847 --> 53:38.549
OH...

53:49.694 --> 53:51.329
OKAY.

54:18.923 --> 54:20.591
THANKS.

54:23.794 --> 54:25.330
HEY.

54:29.033 --> 54:30.335
WHAT?

54:45.082 --> 54:47.652
( motorcycle engine revving )

54:48.653 --> 54:49.987
( whining )

54:50.020 --> 54:51.656
NO, NO. COME ON.
GET OUT.

55:17.415 --> 55:19.450
HANG ON, JIMMY.

55:22.387 --> 55:23.888
( drums beating )

55:23.921 --> 55:26.056
( chanting )

56:05.129 --> 56:06.431
THAT'S A NICE
TRUCK, RAY.

56:06.464 --> 56:09.567
WHERE DID YOU
STEAL IT?

56:09.600 --> 56:11.536
I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT
WANT TO SEE THIS.

56:11.569 --> 56:12.937
WHAT'S GOING ON?

56:12.970 --> 56:14.672
IT'S A POWWOW.

56:16.206 --> 56:17.508
BET THAT EAGLE FEATHER
YOU FOUND

56:17.542 --> 56:19.109
GAVE YOU A LITTLE CHUB.

56:19.143 --> 56:22.079
WE ALL HAVE FEATHERS
FROM THE SAME EAGLE.

56:22.112 --> 56:25.650
WE SHARE
EVERYTHING ON THE RES.

56:25.683 --> 56:27.084
THOSE ARE MY SUNGLASSES.

56:27.117 --> 56:29.587
I TRADED GRANDPA.

56:29.620 --> 56:31.722
I'LL TRADE WITH YOU.

56:34.959 --> 56:36.126
( laughing )

56:36.160 --> 56:37.462
THAT'S A ROCK.

56:37.462 --> 56:38.496
YOU NUTS?

56:38.529 --> 56:39.830
THESE ARE RAY-BANS.

56:39.864 --> 56:40.998
JESUS.

56:46.771 --> 56:49.474
YOU AIN'T GOT NOTHING
ON JIMMY, DO YOU?

56:49.474 --> 56:51.008
YOU'RE NO COP.

56:51.041 --> 56:53.944
FLEEING JUSTICE,
ASSAULT WITH A DEADLY WEAPON

56:53.978 --> 56:56.013
ASSAULT WITH INTENT
TO KILL IS NOTHING?

56:56.046 --> 56:57.682
SEDITION?

56:57.715 --> 57:00.585
THAT SCUM IS AN ENEMY
OF THE UNITED STATES.

57:03.821 --> 57:06.557
YOU KNOW, RAY,
WHEN WE WERE KIDS

57:06.591 --> 57:08.225
WE USED TO PLAY
COWBOYS AND INDIANS.

57:08.258 --> 57:10.495
I WAS ALWAYS GARY COOPER.

57:10.495 --> 57:12.863
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE AN INDIAN.

57:12.897 --> 57:15.132
THE GOVERNMENT BOARDING SCHOOL
MADE SURE OF THAT.

57:15.165 --> 57:17.668
IT CUT OFF MY HAIR

57:17.702 --> 57:18.669
WASHED MY MOUTH OUT
WITH SOAP

57:18.703 --> 57:20.170
WHEN I SPOKE
MY OWN LANGUAGE.

57:20.204 --> 57:23.774
MY OWN LANGUAGE, RAY.

57:23.808 --> 57:26.176
WHEN THE ARM
WARRIORS CAME HERE
IT WAS LIKE AN AWAKENING.

57:26.210 --> 57:28.979
IT GOT THE PEOPLE
PROUD OF THEIR HERITAGE

57:29.013 --> 57:31.682
THEIR ELDERS, LANGUAGE.

57:31.716 --> 57:35.886
AND YOU CALL THEM
ENEMIES.

57:35.920 --> 57:37.221
TOUGH CALL

57:37.254 --> 57:38.623
ALL THE WAY AROUND,
ISN'T IT, RAY?

57:38.656 --> 57:39.824
YOU JUST KEEP DOING THAT.

57:42.159 --> 57:45.095
TOMORROW MORNING
I'LL HAVE LEO'S MURDERER

57:45.129 --> 57:47.131
IN THE BEAR CREEK
TRIBAL JAIL.

57:47.164 --> 57:49.199
SCREW YOUR JURISDICTION.

57:49.233 --> 57:51.135
LISTEN, IF YOU'RE
WITHHOLDING EVIDENCE

57:51.168 --> 57:52.102
YOU'RE IN DEEP SHIT.

57:52.136 --> 57:53.638
SO SUE ME.

58:01.712 --> 58:04.081
( straining: )
OH, OH...

58:04.114 --> 58:05.883
YOU'RE A BIG BOY.

58:18.228 --> 58:19.964
NICE TO RUN INTO YOU,
WASHINGTON.

58:19.997 --> 58:21.732
YEAH, YEAH,
THE WASHINGTON REDSKIN.

58:21.766 --> 58:23.267
HOW ARE YOU?

58:23.300 --> 58:24.835
MAN,
YOU BETTER WATCH YOURSELF.

58:24.869 --> 58:28.138
AROUND HERE, I'M THE F.B.I.--

58:28.172 --> 58:30.107
FULL-BLOODED INDIAN.

58:45.623 --> 58:46.791
Crow Horse:
GRANDPA.

58:51.061 --> 58:52.797
HE WANTS TO TRADE.

58:52.830 --> 58:54.064
HE LIKES YOUR WATCH.

58:54.098 --> 58:55.666
OH, NO,
IMPOSSIBLE.

58:55.700 --> 58:57.635
THIS, UH...

58:57.668 --> 58:58.936
MY GRANDMOTHER
GAVE IT TO ME

58:58.969 --> 59:00.170
WHEN SHE WAS DYING.

59:00.204 --> 59:01.672
EXPLAIN THAT.

59:01.706 --> 59:04.008
( speaking Lakota )

59:04.041 --> 59:06.043
IT'S A ROLEX.

59:12.182 --> 59:13.283
NO WAY.

59:15.853 --> 59:18.055
HE SAYS YOU NEED
TO GO ON INDIAN TIME.

59:18.088 --> 59:20.257
WHITE MAN TIME
WILL GIVE YOU STOMACH CANCER.

59:20.290 --> 59:22.927
NO DEAL.

59:26.697 --> 59:28.633
Ray:
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU'RE AFTER

59:28.666 --> 59:29.767
BUT I'M NOT LOOKING
FOR A WHITE GUY.

59:29.800 --> 59:30.935
GOOD. NEITHER AM I.

59:30.968 --> 59:32.970
IT'S AN OLD LAKOTA BELIEF

59:33.003 --> 59:35.773
THAT IF YOU TURN
A DEAD MAN FACEDOWN

59:35.806 --> 59:37.875
HIS SPIRIT
WON'T COME BACK.

59:37.908 --> 59:39.644
THAT'S A SIOUX THING
A WHITE MAN WOULDN'T KNOW.

59:39.644 --> 59:41.646
IF YOU KNOW SOMETHING,
YOU BETTER TELL ME.

59:41.679 --> 59:42.813
I CAN HELP YOU.

59:42.847 --> 59:44.148
TELL ME
WHAT YOU KNOW.

59:46.884 --> 59:48.686
I WON'T KNOW ANYTHING
TILL TONIGHT.

59:48.719 --> 59:49.954
THEY'RE COMING
TO GRANDPA'S.

59:49.987 --> 59:51.155
WHO'S THEY?

59:51.188 --> 59:52.990
WHO?
THEY ARE.

59:53.023 --> 59:56.727
YOU CAN EITHER
COME TO GRANDPA'S

59:56.761 --> 59:58.696
AND FIND OUT
FOR YOURSELF, OR...

59:58.729 --> 01:00:00.297
YOU CAN GO
AND CHASE JIMMY.

01:00:44.041 --> 01:00:46.010
( speaking Lakota )

01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:55.019
Crow Horse:
HE SAYS BACK BEHIND
RED DEER TABLE

01:00:55.052 --> 01:00:57.988
THERE ARE STRANGE BEINGS
FROM ANOTHER WORLD

01:00:58.022 --> 01:01:01.158
WHO EAT STONES AND DIRT

01:01:01.191 --> 01:01:05.362
AND WHO WILL KILL ANYONE
WHO CROSSES INTO THIS PLACE.

01:01:05.395 --> 01:01:07.832
THIS IS WHAT
THE SPIRITS SAY.

01:01:07.865 --> 01:01:10.901
HE SAYS THEY SAW YOU
GOING BACK INTO THE LAND

01:01:10.935 --> 01:01:12.436
BEYOND RED DEER TABLE.

01:01:12.469 --> 01:01:14.238
I WAS WITH YOU.

01:01:16.206 --> 01:01:18.175
BUT THAT'S ALL THEY TELL

01:01:18.208 --> 01:01:20.745
SO HE DOESN'T KNOW
IF YOU WERE KILLED OR NOT.

01:01:20.745 --> 01:01:22.813
HE THINKS
YOU PROBABLY WERE

01:01:22.847 --> 01:01:24.749
BUT IT WAS A GOOD DAY
TO DIE.

01:01:27.885 --> 01:01:30.087
GO TO RED DEER TABLE.

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:31.421
GO TO THE LAND

01:01:31.455 --> 01:01:33.157
WHERE THE ELK PEOPLE
USED TO LIVE

01:01:33.190 --> 01:01:35.459
BUT YOU MUST GO AS TWO.

01:01:35.492 --> 01:01:38.328
THIS IS THE VISION I RECEIVED.

01:01:41.298 --> 01:01:43.901
I HAVE SPOKEN,
AND IT IS SO.

01:02:11.128 --> 01:02:12.963
Woman:
RAYMOND?

01:02:12.997 --> 01:02:15.032
RAYMOND?

01:02:18.535 --> 01:02:21.038
GET AWAY FROM HIM, RAYMOND.

01:02:21.071 --> 01:02:24.341
COME HERE TO ME.
HE'S DRUNK.

01:02:24.374 --> 01:02:24.809
GET AWAY FROM HIM.

01:02:24.809 --> 01:02:26.243
LET GO OF HIM!

01:02:26.276 --> 01:02:27.477
COME ON. COME HERE.

01:02:27.511 --> 01:02:28.478
LET GO!

01:02:40.490 --> 01:02:42.392
( breathing hard )

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:49.433
WHOA, WHOA! EASY, HOSS.

01:02:49.466 --> 01:02:51.101
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

01:02:51.135 --> 01:02:53.470
RED DEER TABLE, RAY,
WE HAVE TO GO TOGETHER.

01:02:53.503 --> 01:02:56.073
YOU CAN'T MESS
WITH THE VISIONS!

01:02:56.106 --> 01:02:57.407
SOMEONE WAS SUPPOSED
TO TALK.

01:02:57.441 --> 01:02:58.508
THEY DID.

01:02:58.542 --> 01:03:00.010
BULLSHIT.

01:03:00.044 --> 01:03:01.912
YOU'RE BULLSHIT.

01:03:09.419 --> 01:03:11.388
IT'S OKAY.

01:03:11.421 --> 01:03:13.023
I KNOW YOU'RE SCARED.

01:03:13.057 --> 01:03:15.092
OKAY? JUST DON'T BE SCARED.

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:17.027
YOU'RE FIGHTING IT.

01:03:17.061 --> 01:03:19.129
JUST DON'T FIGHT IT.

01:03:19.163 --> 01:03:21.198
OKAY?

01:03:21.231 --> 01:03:23.067
OKAY, RAYMOND?

01:03:23.100 --> 01:03:24.902
GET OUT OF MY FACE.

01:03:24.935 --> 01:03:26.871
Grandpa:
KNOCK IT OFF!

01:03:26.871 --> 01:03:29.506
KNOCK IT OFF!

01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:33.010
YOU REMIND ME
OF A COUPLE OF OLD WOMEN.

01:03:34.912 --> 01:03:36.346
HE SPEAKS ENGLISH.

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:38.448
YEAH.

01:03:38.482 --> 01:03:40.885
ONLY WHEN HE'S REALLY
PISSED OFF.

01:03:42.987 --> 01:03:46.456
( Grandpa chuckling )

01:03:47.992 --> 01:03:51.028
COME ON UP AND WATCH TV.

01:03:54.564 --> 01:03:57.902
( both laughing )

01:04:03.941 --> 01:04:06.076
JESUS, YOU GAVE ME
A SCARE.

01:04:06.110 --> 01:04:08.045
YOU OKAY?

01:04:32.236 --> 01:04:34.604
Man: WE GOT ONE.

01:04:34.638 --> 01:04:36.640
SADDLE UP.

01:04:36.673 --> 01:04:38.508
STOP THE TRUCK!

01:04:38.542 --> 01:04:41.178
HOLD IT
RIGHT THERE!

01:04:41.211 --> 01:04:43.580
STOP IT!

01:04:43.613 --> 01:04:45.015
( guns cocking )

01:04:45.049 --> 01:04:46.150
DON'T MOVE.

01:04:46.183 --> 01:04:48.518
F.B.I.

01:04:48.552 --> 01:04:49.987
GET HIM OUT
OF THERE.

01:04:50.020 --> 01:04:51.121
GET OUT.

01:04:51.155 --> 01:04:53.023
F.B.I.

01:04:53.057 --> 01:04:55.159
SORRY.

01:04:55.192 --> 01:04:56.493
FED. LET HIM THROUGH.

01:05:09.506 --> 01:05:13.277
( music drifting out )

01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:16.380
( people talking )

01:05:34.631 --> 01:05:36.466
Cooch:
YEAH, I CAN HEAR YOU.

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.368
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

01:05:38.402 --> 01:05:40.137
PRETTY SOON, I THINK.

01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:42.506
YEAH, ME TOO.

01:05:42.539 --> 01:05:43.607
HOW DID IT GO AT REACHES'?

01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:45.275
NOTHING.

01:05:45.309 --> 01:05:46.376
WHAT? I'M LOSING YOU.

01:05:46.410 --> 01:05:48.278
TALK LOUDER.

01:05:48.312 --> 01:05:51.448
ARE YOU LOCKING
THE GARAGE DOOR AT NIGHT?

01:05:51.481 --> 01:05:53.517
SOMETHING HAPPEN?

01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:55.352
FIELD SUPPORT FROM RAPID.

01:05:55.385 --> 01:05:56.653
WE'RE SETTING UP A NET.

01:05:56.686 --> 01:05:59.256
NO, NOT THE MUD ROOM DOOR.

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:00.557
NO, THE OVERHEAD.

01:06:00.590 --> 01:06:02.526
YEAH, I KNOW.

01:06:02.559 --> 01:06:04.428
IT'S EASIER FOR SOMEONE
TO BREAK IN WITH A REMOTE.

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:06.063
WE BLEW OUR THREE-DAY, RAY.

01:06:06.096 --> 01:06:07.531
YEAH, LOOK...

01:06:07.564 --> 01:06:11.701
OKAY, HONEY,
I GOT TO RUN.

01:06:11.735 --> 01:06:13.537
OKAY.

01:06:13.570 --> 01:06:15.139
YEAH, REAL SOON.

01:06:15.172 --> 01:06:16.606
ME TOO.

01:06:18.075 --> 01:06:19.709
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?

01:06:21.778 --> 01:06:25.049
WELL, I HAD HIM, RAY.

01:06:25.082 --> 01:06:27.784
I HAD HIS ASS
AT A TRADITIONAL'S PLACE

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:29.553
IN RED CROW

01:06:29.586 --> 01:06:33.657
BUT HE JUST SLIPPED OUT
BEFORE I COULD MOVE IN.

01:06:33.690 --> 01:06:35.692
SO HE LEFT THAT.

01:06:35.725 --> 01:06:39.063
THAT'S THE ANIMAL.

01:06:44.434 --> 01:06:46.370
PIN TEST?

01:06:46.403 --> 01:06:47.337
YEAH, YOU BET.

01:06:47.371 --> 01:06:48.705
THE WHOLE WORKS.

01:06:48.738 --> 01:06:50.707
WE'RE SENDING IT OFF
TO RAPID IN A MINUTE.

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:52.642
WE GOT SOMETHING HARD
ON HIM NOW--

01:06:52.676 --> 01:06:53.743
CONCLUSIVE.

01:06:53.777 --> 01:06:55.545
FANTASTIC.

01:06:55.579 --> 01:06:57.447
YOU DID A GOOD JOB.

01:06:57.481 --> 01:06:59.549
YOUR NAME'S ON THE 302.

01:06:59.583 --> 01:07:00.750
HEY, BRIAN?

01:07:00.784 --> 01:07:02.119
YEAH?

01:07:02.152 --> 01:07:06.090
GET THAT TO D.C.

01:07:06.123 --> 01:07:09.093
Man #1:
WHO'S UP IN
BELLE FOURCHE?

01:07:09.093 --> 01:07:11.228
Man #2:
I THINK JACKSON'S
UP THERE.

01:07:11.261 --> 01:07:13.230
Man #1:
GET HIM ON THE HORN.

01:07:13.263 --> 01:07:14.464
YOU OKAY?

01:07:14.498 --> 01:07:15.632
SURE.

01:07:15.665 --> 01:07:17.167
YOU DON'T LOOK SO HOT.

01:07:20.504 --> 01:07:23.340
COME ON.
LET'S GO GET SOME AIR.

01:07:24.741 --> 01:07:26.710
Cooch:
YOU WANT A SODA?

01:07:32.416 --> 01:07:34.284
YOU GOT A DOG
IN YOUR TRUCK.

01:07:34.318 --> 01:07:36.286
THAT'S JIMMY.

01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.621
I FED IT.

01:07:37.654 --> 01:07:39.456
CAN'T GET
RID OF IT.

01:07:39.489 --> 01:07:41.758
LOOK LIKE YOU'VE SEEN
A FUCKING GHOST, RAY.

01:07:46.230 --> 01:07:49.333
SEEING THINGS
OUT HERE, COOCH.

01:07:50.867 --> 01:07:52.502
THIS PLACE WILL
DO THAT TO YOU.

01:07:52.536 --> 01:07:54.804
I, UH...

01:07:54.838 --> 01:07:57.274
HAVE YOU..?

01:08:01.211 --> 01:08:03.447
I PASSED A ROADBLOCK
ON THE WAY IN HERE.

01:08:03.480 --> 01:08:07.351
GOONS WERE ARMED
LIKE THE FUCKING MARINES.

01:08:07.384 --> 01:08:09.319
FUGITIVE ALERT.

01:08:12.789 --> 01:08:15.325
CAN YOU TELL ME
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON?

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:18.295
I MEAN, UH...

01:08:18.328 --> 01:08:20.430
WE'RE HERE TO DO
A MOP-UP, RIGHT?

01:08:22.866 --> 01:08:25.535
YEAH, YEAH.

01:08:25.569 --> 01:08:27.770
WE'RE MOPPING UP
A HOMICIDE, OKAY?

01:08:27.804 --> 01:08:29.372
THESE PEOPLE CAN'T SEEM
TO TAKE CARE

01:08:29.406 --> 01:08:30.807
OF THEIR OWN MESSES, RAY.

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:33.477
INTERNAL CIVIL CONFLICT.

01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:34.844
THEY'VE BEEN
AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS

01:08:34.877 --> 01:08:36.613
FOR OVER 100 YEARS.

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:38.314
WE CAN'T GET
SUCKERED INTO THAT.

01:08:38.348 --> 01:08:41.251
WE'RE HERE TO TAKE OUR MAN
AND GO HOME. ALL RIGHT?

01:08:47.491 --> 01:08:49.393
THIS MILTON,
DOES HE CHECK OUT?

01:08:49.426 --> 01:08:52.796
WELL, A SITUATION LIKE THIS

01:08:52.828 --> 01:08:55.599
IT'S HARD TO
TELL THE GOOD GUYS
FROM THE BAD GUYS.

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:57.634
THEY'RE ALL INDIANS.

01:08:57.667 --> 01:09:00.203
IT'S A MESS.

01:09:03.939 --> 01:09:08.578
I'VE BEEN STUDYING THIS FIELD
FOR NINE YEARS, RAY.

01:09:08.612 --> 01:09:11.648
I KNOW MORE ABOUT THE LAW
AND THE HISTORY OUT HERE

01:09:11.680 --> 01:09:13.483
THAN THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES.

01:09:13.517 --> 01:09:14.684
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

01:09:14.718 --> 01:09:16.220
I FEEL FOR THEM,
I REALLY DO.

01:09:16.252 --> 01:09:17.654
THEY'RE A PROUD PEOPLE

01:09:17.687 --> 01:09:20.424
BUT THEY'RE ALSO
A CONQUERED PEOPLE.

01:09:20.457 --> 01:09:23.760
THAT MEANS
THEIR FUTURE IS DICTATED

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:25.662
BY THE NATION
THAT CONQUERED THEM.

01:09:25.694 --> 01:09:28.332
NOW, RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY
THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS.

01:09:28.365 --> 01:09:30.600
I'VE SEEN SOME
FIELD AGENTS

01:09:30.634 --> 01:09:32.435
BREAK THE RULES OUT HERE.

01:09:32.469 --> 01:09:34.371
I'VE SEEN EXCESS AND ERROR.

01:09:37.607 --> 01:09:43.380
BUT I'VE ALSO SEEN
TWO AGENTS, FAMILY MEN

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:46.850
LAYING BELLY-DOWN IN THE GRASS
WITH THEIR HEADS BLOWN OFF

01:09:48.984 --> 01:09:51.455
AND THEY WERE JUST
DOING THEIR JOB, RAY.

01:09:51.488 --> 01:09:55.959
IDEALISTIC AGENTS,
LIKE ALL THE REST OF US.

01:09:55.992 --> 01:09:59.829
PROTECTING THE INTEGRITY
OF THE AMERICAN DREAM.

01:10:05.435 --> 01:10:09.939
LOOKS TWICE IS AN ENEMY
OF THE UNITED STATES, RAY.

01:10:09.973 --> 01:10:13.443
THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.

01:10:13.477 --> 01:10:15.011
SENSITIVE OPERATIONS UNIT.

01:10:15.044 --> 01:10:17.247
YOU BETTER BELIEVE IT.

01:10:20.717 --> 01:10:22.386
NOW GET IN THE CHUTE,
PUT YOUR VEST ON

01:10:22.419 --> 01:10:23.920
AND LET'S GET READY
TO TAKE HIM.

01:10:26.423 --> 01:10:28.024
YOU OKAY ABOUT THIS?

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:29.559
SURE.

01:10:31.995 --> 01:10:33.497
PUT YOUR GAME FACE ON

01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:34.864
AND GET OUT THERE
TO THE OLD MAN'S.

01:10:41.805 --> 01:10:44.674
( singing in Lakota )

01:11:08.865 --> 01:11:10.934
( gasping )

01:11:31.388 --> 01:11:35.859
4:16 A.M.,
SAM REACHES' RESIDENCE.

01:11:35.892 --> 01:11:39.529
SUBJECT IS...

01:11:39.563 --> 01:11:41.398
...SINGING.

01:11:44.033 --> 01:11:46.836
OUTSTANDING.

01:11:49.973 --> 01:11:52.476
( humming )

01:11:55.812 --> 01:11:57.914
( whining )

01:12:11.995 --> 01:12:14.864
OH, CHRIST.

01:12:14.898 --> 01:12:16.466
( gunfire )

01:12:20.770 --> 01:12:23.006
SHOOTING AT SAM REACHES'
RESIDENCE. OVER.

01:12:23.039 --> 01:12:24.774
SHOT CAME FROM OVER HERE.

01:12:24.808 --> 01:12:26.710
I WANT TO TAKE
THIS PLACE APART!

01:12:26.743 --> 01:12:28.612
GOT A BUNKER OVER HERE.
LET'S CHECK IT OUT.

01:12:31.581 --> 01:12:33.850
I WANT CASINGS.
CASINGS.

01:12:33.883 --> 01:12:35.685
FIND ME SOME CASINGS!

01:12:35.719 --> 01:12:37.086
GOT SOMETHING
OVER HERE!

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:38.988
IF YOU'RE GOING
TO BE A TEAM PLAYER

01:12:39.022 --> 01:12:40.924
GIVE ME
THOSE REPORTS...

01:12:40.957 --> 01:12:43.460
I HEARD YOU
THE FIRST TIME!

01:12:43.493 --> 01:12:45.995
LOOKS LIKE JIMMY'S PLAYING
CRAZY HORSE WITH US AGAIN.

01:12:46.029 --> 01:12:49.799
LATER.

01:12:49.833 --> 01:12:51.935
WHATEVER YOU SAY, CHIEF.

01:12:55.572 --> 01:12:57.441
NO.

01:12:57.474 --> 01:12:58.842
I DON'T CARE!
IF IT'S BREATHING, PICK IT UP!

01:12:58.875 --> 01:13:00.176
NO.

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:01.978
JUST GO INSIDE.

01:13:02.011 --> 01:13:03.613
WHY DID YOU
TEAR IT DOWN?

01:13:03.647 --> 01:13:05.114
OKAY?

01:13:11.120 --> 01:13:12.689
FEDERAL ISSUE.

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:18.595
NO, NO, NO.

01:13:18.628 --> 01:13:20.630
HARD EVIDENCE,
PHYSICAL EVIDENCE.

01:13:20.664 --> 01:13:21.798
WHAT DID
THE OLD MAN WANT?

01:13:21.831 --> 01:13:24.968
OH, JUST SOME MONEY.

01:13:28.071 --> 01:13:29.673
COME ON.
LET'S TAKE A RIDE.

01:13:47.791 --> 01:13:49.926
YOU KNOW, IF EITHER ONE
OF US GETS HIT, RAY

01:13:51.027 --> 01:13:53.630
IT WILL BE ALL SHE WROTE.

01:13:55.499 --> 01:13:57.166
WE'LL HAVE A FULL-SCALE
WAR ON OUR HANDS.

01:13:59.836 --> 01:14:01.805
OH, SHIT.

01:14:02.872 --> 01:14:04.508
CHIEF PAIN IN THE ASS.

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:12.649
HEY, I DON'T MEAN
TO STEP ALL OVER

01:14:12.682 --> 01:14:14.183
YOUR JURISDICTION

01:14:14.217 --> 01:14:16.553
BUT CAN I BORROW YOUR RADIO
TO REPORT A FOUND VEHICLE--

01:14:16.586 --> 01:14:19.022
A 19 AND 60 CHEVROLET,
BLUE AND WHITE

01:14:19.055 --> 01:14:20.957
REGISTERED
TO ONE LEO FAST ELK...

01:14:22.726 --> 01:14:24.227
DECEASED.

01:14:39.543 --> 01:14:41.077
HOW ABOUT THAT?

01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:42.746
Crow Horse:
YEAH, HOW ABOUT THAT?

01:14:46.215 --> 01:14:48.051
HUBCAP!

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.656
WE'LL SEE IF IT
MATCHES ANYTHING.

01:14:52.689 --> 01:14:53.990
OKAY.

01:14:54.023 --> 01:14:56.726
OH, A FUCKING HUBCAP.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:58.294
Mackey: DEFINITELY
A CITY INDIAN, COOCH.

01:14:58.327 --> 01:14:59.729
RESERVATION INDIAN

01:14:59.763 --> 01:15:01.164
WOULD HAVE TAKEN DROUGHT
INTO CONSIDERATION.

01:15:01.197 --> 01:15:02.632
THAT'S ABOUT PAR
FOR THE COURSE.

01:15:02.666 --> 01:15:03.933
YEAH. BRILLIANT.

01:15:07.771 --> 01:15:09.673
HOW ARE YOU
MAKING OUT?

01:15:09.706 --> 01:15:11.074
Agent:
GOT A FEW PARTIALS.

01:15:13.843 --> 01:15:16.580
COOCH, THE KILLER LOOKS
LIKE A REAL BIG GUY.

01:15:18.281 --> 01:15:19.883
HEY, KEN, BAG IT.

01:15:22.151 --> 01:15:24.621
I'LL DO IT.

01:15:46.676 --> 01:15:48.712
IS THAT A WARRANT
FOR GRANDMA?

01:15:50.847 --> 01:15:53.717
SHE'S GONE.

01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:55.819
I SENT HER AWAY
WITH THE CHILDREN

01:15:55.852 --> 01:15:57.186
WHERE THEY'LL BE SAFE.

01:15:58.988 --> 01:16:01.691
GOOD.

01:16:01.725 --> 01:16:03.993
HOW'S YOUR SON?

01:16:04.027 --> 01:16:05.862
HE'S HEALING.

01:16:05.895 --> 01:16:08.798
THANKS FOR ASKING.

01:16:08.832 --> 01:16:10.634
AND THANKS.

01:16:13.169 --> 01:16:14.771
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:16:14.804 --> 01:16:17.140
TAKING SAMPLES FOR TESTING.

01:16:17.173 --> 01:16:20.043
MORE PEOPLE
HAVE BEEN GETTING SICK.

01:16:20.076 --> 01:16:21.244
I'M SORRY I GOT

01:16:21.277 --> 01:16:22.779
YOUR FAMILY INVOLVED IN THIS.

01:16:24.047 --> 01:16:25.882
RAY, MY FAMILY'S
BEEN INVOLVED

01:16:25.915 --> 01:16:29.218
SINCE COLUMBUS LANDED.

01:16:29.252 --> 01:16:32.221
LISTEN, MY PARTNER IS CREATING
AN AIRTIGHT CASE.

01:16:32.255 --> 01:16:35.324
JIMMY HAS NO CHANCE,
EXCEPT FOR THIS EVIDENCE.

01:16:35.358 --> 01:16:38.662
NOW, IF THIS WERE
TO FALL INTO THE WRONG HANDS

01:16:40.063 --> 01:16:41.898
I THINK IT MIGHT
DESTROY THIS CASE.

01:16:41.931 --> 01:16:43.800
CROW HORSE TOLD ME

01:16:43.833 --> 01:16:46.235
THAT A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO

01:16:46.269 --> 01:16:49.706
YOU HELD A RAFFLE
AT A BENEFIT CONCERT.

01:16:49.739 --> 01:16:51.240
DID YOU KEEP ANY RECORDS?

01:16:51.274 --> 01:16:53.009
I CAN'T DO THAT, RAY.

01:16:53.042 --> 01:16:55.779
THIS EVIDENCE IS
THE ONLY POWER WE HAVE

01:16:55.812 --> 01:16:56.880
TO BUILD A CASE.

01:16:56.913 --> 01:16:58.882
THAT'S NOT POWER, RAY.

01:16:58.915 --> 01:17:00.750
THAT'S PAPER.

01:17:00.784 --> 01:17:02.085
OH, CHRIST.

01:17:02.118 --> 01:17:03.687
RAY!

01:17:11.227 --> 01:17:13.697
POWER IS A RAINSTORM.

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:21.738
POWER IS THAT RIVER
RIGHT THERE

01:17:21.771 --> 01:17:23.773
AND THAT'S WHAT
I HAVE TO PROTECT--

01:17:23.807 --> 01:17:25.008
NOT THE WHITE LAW.

01:17:26.309 --> 01:17:28.878
IF JIMMY GOES TO PRISON
FOR BEING A WARRIOR

01:17:28.912 --> 01:17:30.146
THAT IS SOMETHING
HE ACCEPTS.

01:17:30.179 --> 01:17:32.281
THAT'S HIS WAY.

01:17:32.315 --> 01:17:34.350
THAT'S OUR WAY.

01:17:34.383 --> 01:17:37.721
IT'S THE INDIAN WAY
TO LET JIMMY GO DOWN.

01:17:39.122 --> 01:17:40.957
YOU CAN'T UNDERSTAND.

01:17:40.990 --> 01:17:42.091
YOU'RE NOT INDIAN.

01:17:42.125 --> 01:17:43.192
MY FATHER WAS AN INDIAN.

01:17:43.226 --> 01:17:44.828
YOU NEVER KNEW HIM.

01:17:44.861 --> 01:17:46.730
I KNEW MY FATHER.
HE WAS CRAZY.

01:17:46.730 --> 01:17:50.299
HE BUILT BRIDGES
AND SKYSCRAPERS

01:17:50.333 --> 01:17:54.337
WITHOUT A SAFETY HARNESS
IN HIS BARE FEET.

01:17:54.370 --> 01:17:55.739
I KNEW MY FATHER,
MAGGIE.

01:17:55.739 --> 01:17:59.008
I WAS ALWAYS AFRAID HE'D FALL

01:17:59.042 --> 01:18:00.744
AND THAT HE'D SAY,
"DON'T WORRY, WASHI.

01:18:00.777 --> 01:18:02.178
I CAN FLY."

01:18:02.211 --> 01:18:04.180
THAT'S WHAT
HE'D CALL ME.

01:18:04.213 --> 01:18:06.850
HE CALLED ME WASHI,
BUT HE COULDN'T FLY, MAGGIE.

01:18:06.883 --> 01:18:09.052
HE TRIED, BUT...

01:18:09.085 --> 01:18:15.191
HE DRANK HIMSELF TO DEATH...

01:18:15.224 --> 01:18:18.094
IN FRONT OF ME AND MY MOTHER.

01:18:18.127 --> 01:18:21.330
I WAS ASHAMED OF HIM.

01:18:21.364 --> 01:18:24.768
SO I BURIED HIM

01:18:26.335 --> 01:18:28.772
TILL MY OWN PEOPLE
DUG HIM BACK UP.

01:18:30.239 --> 01:18:31.841
MY OWN PEOPLE.

01:18:35.812 --> 01:18:37.981
WHAT?

01:18:38.014 --> 01:18:40.884
WASHI.

01:18:40.917 --> 01:18:42.786
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS?

01:18:42.786 --> 01:18:46.222
HE SAID IT MEANT "GOOD BOY."

01:18:46.255 --> 01:18:49.993
IT'S THE LARD
WE PUT IN STEW.

01:18:50.026 --> 01:18:52.796
GREAT.

01:18:54.798 --> 01:18:56.833
I THINK HE WAS CALLING YOU
A CHUBBY BOY.

01:19:00.136 --> 01:19:03.139
WHOEVER BOUGHT THIS TICKET
KILLED LEO FAST ELK.

01:19:20.023 --> 01:19:22.058
I GOT TO GO, RAY.

01:19:24.460 --> 01:19:26.395
LISTEN, THERE'S
ROADBLOCKS EVERYWHERE.

01:19:26.429 --> 01:19:29.032
IT'S NOT SAFE.

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:33.536
I'LL BE OKAY, RAY.

01:19:40.109 --> 01:19:42.245
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

01:19:43.512 --> 01:19:45.381
TO THE SOURCE.

01:19:45.414 --> 01:19:47.951
THE SOURCE?

01:19:51.587 --> 01:19:58.061
YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO DO THE SAME...

01:19:58.094 --> 01:19:59.428
WASHI.

01:19:59.462 --> 01:20:01.130
( laughing )

01:20:36.299 --> 01:20:38.534
( chanting )

01:21:49.572 --> 01:21:51.007
( screaming )

01:22:14.597 --> 01:22:16.165
( engine starting )

01:22:31.647 --> 01:22:33.216
HELLO.

01:22:35.218 --> 01:22:37.353
( speaking Lakota )

01:22:40.056 --> 01:22:42.658
GRANDPA,
SPEAK ENGLISH, PLEASE?

01:22:42.691 --> 01:22:45.328
LISTEN, I NEED TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME.

01:22:45.361 --> 01:22:47.230
I...

01:22:49.165 --> 01:22:51.434
WHAT... YOU GOT
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

01:22:51.467 --> 01:22:52.701
Looks Twice:
I BELONG HERE.

01:22:52.735 --> 01:22:55.238
WHY AREN'T YOU
AT RED DEER TABLE?

01:22:55.271 --> 01:22:58.241
WHAT IS THE BIG DEAL
ABOUT THAT PLACE?

01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:03.312
CAN'T I GET A STRAIGHT ANSWER?

01:23:03.346 --> 01:23:06.349
FAST ELK FOUND OUT ITS POWER,
SO THEY KILLED HIM.

01:23:06.382 --> 01:23:09.385
WELL, THEY'LL KILL YOU
IF YOU STAY HERE.

01:23:09.418 --> 01:23:12.121
SOMETIMES THEY
HAVE TO KILL US.

01:23:12.155 --> 01:23:15.058
THEY HAVE TO KILL US

01:23:15.091 --> 01:23:18.127
BECAUSE THEY CAN'T
BREAK OUR SPIRIT.

01:23:25.434 --> 01:23:27.470
LOOK

01:23:27.503 --> 01:23:29.572
I DON'T HAVE
TO DO THIS.

01:23:29.605 --> 01:23:31.774
YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY CHOICE.

01:23:31.807 --> 01:23:34.243
I AM TRYING TO HELP YOU.
WHY WON'T YOU ACCEPT THAT?

01:23:34.277 --> 01:23:36.179
IT'S IN OUR DNA.

01:23:36.212 --> 01:23:38.447
YOU HAVE TO DO
WHAT OLD MAN SAYS.

01:23:45.621 --> 01:23:48.624
WHAT MAKES YOU
SUCH A THREAT?

01:23:52.195 --> 01:23:54.597
WE CHOOSE THE RIGHT
TO BE WHO WE ARE.

01:23:54.630 --> 01:23:56.365
WE KNOW THE DIFFERENCE

01:23:56.399 --> 01:23:57.466
BETWEEN THE REALITY
OF FREEDOM

01:23:57.500 --> 01:23:59.668
AND THE ILLUSION OF FREEDOM.

01:24:03.272 --> 01:24:04.573
THERE'S A WAY
TO LIVE WITH EARTH

01:24:04.607 --> 01:24:06.542
AND A WAY NOT TO LIVE
WITH EARTH.

01:24:06.575 --> 01:24:08.577
WE CHOOSE THE WAY OF EARTH.

01:24:13.249 --> 01:24:14.783
IT'S ABOUT POWER...

01:24:14.817 --> 01:24:16.419
RAY.

01:24:16.452 --> 01:24:18.121
( door banging )

01:24:18.121 --> 01:24:19.255
Mackey:
F.B.I.!

01:24:19.288 --> 01:24:20.856
GET THEM UP, JIMMY.

01:24:20.889 --> 01:24:22.358
GET THEM UP!

01:24:23.426 --> 01:24:24.560
GET THEM UP!

01:24:24.593 --> 01:24:26.129
GET THEM UP, JIMMY.

01:24:26.162 --> 01:24:27.596
GET THEM UP!

01:24:32.568 --> 01:24:35.404
GET UP,
SON OF A BITCH.

01:24:35.438 --> 01:24:36.472
Mackey:
ON YOUR FEET, GRANDPA.

01:24:36.505 --> 01:24:37.840
YOU'RE IN LOTS OF TROUBLE.

01:24:37.873 --> 01:24:39.275
LET'S GO.

01:24:39.308 --> 01:24:41.610
UP, UP, COME ON.

01:24:41.644 --> 01:24:43.146
TAKE IT EASY

01:24:43.179 --> 01:24:44.547
CALM DOWN.

01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:45.781
GET HIM IN THERE.

01:24:45.814 --> 01:24:47.450
COME ON, LET'S GO.

01:24:47.483 --> 01:24:49.318
MOVE, MOVE, MOVE!
GET HIM IN THERE.

01:24:49.352 --> 01:24:51.320
GET HIM
OUT HERE.

01:24:51.354 --> 01:24:53.222
HE KNOWS NOTHING.

01:24:53.256 --> 01:24:54.257
Mackey:
YOU BEEN TEACHING
THESE CRIMINALS

01:24:54.290 --> 01:24:55.324
ABOUT THE GREAT
RED SPIRIT, SAM?

01:24:55.358 --> 01:24:56.459
CHECK HIM FOR PEYOTE.

01:24:56.492 --> 01:24:57.760
HE'S GOT A KNIFE!

01:24:57.793 --> 01:25:00.263
HEY, WHAT IS THIS,
A MAGIC RATTLE?

01:25:00.296 --> 01:25:02.565
YOU GOING TO DO
A RAIN DANCE--

01:25:02.598 --> 01:25:04.300
END THIS DROUGHT?

01:25:05.734 --> 01:25:07.170
HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING.

01:25:07.203 --> 01:25:09.238
LEAVE HIM ALONE!

01:25:09.272 --> 01:25:10.839
HEY, HEY,
TAKE IT EASY!

01:25:13.676 --> 01:25:16.345
HEY, TAKE IT EASY,
DAMN IT!

01:25:19.682 --> 01:25:24.220
FOR CHRIST'S SAKE,
WE GOT HIM, DIDN'T WE?

01:25:24.253 --> 01:25:26.922
YOU GUYS JUST CALM DOWN
AND TAKE IT EASY, ALL RIGHT?

01:25:26.955 --> 01:25:28.657
IT'S ALL OVER.

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:42.738
( speaking Lakota )

01:25:42.771 --> 01:25:44.440
Cooch:
WELL, WE NAILED HIM, JACK.

01:25:44.473 --> 01:25:45.408
I KNEW HE WOULD HAVE
TO COME BACK TO GRANDPA'S

01:25:45.441 --> 01:25:46.842
SOONER OR LATER.

01:25:46.875 --> 01:25:48.477
RAY MADE THE COLLAR.

01:25:51.714 --> 01:25:53.682
WELL, THE ARM IS BUSTED.

01:25:53.716 --> 01:25:55.651
MAYBE NOW WE'LL HAVE
A LITTLE PEACE HERE--

01:25:55.684 --> 01:25:57.886
NO MORE AGITATORS
STIRRING UP TROUBLE.

01:25:57.920 --> 01:26:00.356
GOOD, KOLA.

01:26:00.389 --> 01:26:02.391
Cooch:
LET'S CLOSE THIS THING OUT.

01:26:02.425 --> 01:26:03.692
DRINKS ARE ON ME
AT THE BUFFALO BUTTE.

01:26:03.726 --> 01:26:08.864
WHOO!

01:26:08.897 --> 01:26:10.633
WE'LL SEE YOU
OVER THERE, RAY.

01:26:10.666 --> 01:26:13.236
MAKE A COLLECT CALL
TO DAWES--

01:26:13.236 --> 01:26:15.238
TELL HIM HIS INDIAN
DID ALL RIGHT.

01:26:15.271 --> 01:26:17.940
WE'LL BE OUT OF HERE
TOMORROW.

01:26:22.345 --> 01:26:24.280
Milton:
YEAH, SEE YOU LATER.

01:26:32.555 --> 01:26:34.657
LISTEN, UH...

01:26:34.690 --> 01:26:37.260
I'M NOT WHO
YOU THINK I AM.

01:26:40.996 --> 01:26:43.732
I'M SORRY.

01:26:43.766 --> 01:26:47.270
UM, BACK THAT WAY

01:26:47.303 --> 01:26:50.773
IS A PLACE CALLED
WOUNDED KNEE.

01:26:50.806 --> 01:26:54.843
I WAS ONE YEAR OLD THERE

01:26:54.877 --> 01:26:58.414
WHEN THEY CAME AND SHOT
OUR PEOPLE DOWN

01:26:58.447 --> 01:27:02.818
BECAUSE THEY WERE
GHOST DANCING.

01:27:02.851 --> 01:27:05.754
THEY BELIEVED
THIS DANCE

01:27:05.788 --> 01:27:08.324
WILL STOP THE WHITE MAN
FROM COMING

01:27:08.357 --> 01:27:11.894
AND BRING BACK THE BUFFALO.

01:27:11.927 --> 01:27:16.732
THEY SHOT 300 OF US.

01:27:16.765 --> 01:27:20.536
ONE OF THOSE KILLED
WAS A HOLY MAN

01:27:20.569 --> 01:27:24.307
CALLED WAKIYAN CANTE--

01:27:24.307 --> 01:27:26.509
THUNDERHEART.

01:27:26.542 --> 01:27:29.578
HE WAS KILLED WHILE RUNNING

01:27:29.612 --> 01:27:32.381
FOR THE STRONGHOLD.

01:27:36.619 --> 01:27:38.987
IT IS HIS BLOOD--

01:27:39.021 --> 01:27:42.791
THE SAME BLOOD
THAT WAS SPILLED

01:27:42.825 --> 01:27:46.462
IN THE GRASS AND SNOW
AT WOUNDED KNEE--

01:27:46.495 --> 01:27:50.866
RUNS THROUGH YOUR HEART
LIKE A BUFFALO.

01:27:52.768 --> 01:27:56.805
THUNDERHEART
HAS COME--

01:27:56.839 --> 01:28:02.077
SENT HERE TO A TROUBLED PLACE
TO HELP HIS PEOPLE.

01:28:02.110 --> 01:28:05.448
THAT'S WHAT
I'M TOLD.

01:28:10.519 --> 01:28:12.755
( chanting )

01:28:12.788 --> 01:28:16.058
( chanting )

01:28:16.091 --> 01:28:18.561
( chanting )

01:28:18.594 --> 01:28:21.364
( engine starting )

01:28:26.969 --> 01:28:29.071
RUN.

01:28:29.104 --> 01:28:31.540
RUN FOR THE STRONGHOLD,
THUNDERHEART.

01:28:31.574 --> 01:28:36.512
RUN.

01:28:36.545 --> 01:28:39.748
THE SOLDIERS ARE COMING.

01:28:52.428 --> 01:28:54.897
THEY BROKE MY TV.

01:30:46.742 --> 01:30:48.076
( door closing )

01:30:49.778 --> 01:30:51.880
YELLOW HAWK.

01:31:07.896 --> 01:31:09.231
( thumping )

01:31:44.266 --> 01:31:46.134
( thumping )

01:32:12.260 --> 01:32:13.929
( screeching )

01:32:37.786 --> 01:32:39.121
( knocking )

01:32:47.195 --> 01:32:50.733
OH. THE WASHINGTON REDSKIN.

01:32:53.135 --> 01:32:54.937
THOUGHT YOU'D
BE GONE BY NOW.

01:32:56.204 --> 01:32:58.240
I'D LIKE TO BE, RICHARD.

01:32:58.273 --> 01:32:59.742
I'D LIKE TO BE.

01:33:02.044 --> 01:33:04.112
BUT, UH...

01:33:06.114 --> 01:33:08.250
YOU'RE IN A LOT
OF TROUBLE, RICHARD.

01:33:08.283 --> 01:33:10.318
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

01:33:10.352 --> 01:33:12.320
THAT MUST BE A BITCH.

01:33:12.354 --> 01:33:15.991
HOW LONG
YOU BEEN IN IT?

01:33:16.024 --> 01:33:19.127
SINCE I GOT AN IRON PIPE
PUT ACROSS MY KNEES, MAN.

01:33:19.161 --> 01:33:21.830
FIGHT WITH THREE WASI'CUS,
YOU KNOW?

01:33:21.864 --> 01:33:25.668
YEAH, THAT WAS
AT SIOUX FALLS PEN, WASN'T IT?

01:33:25.701 --> 01:33:27.402
THAT WAS LEAVENWORTH.

01:33:27.435 --> 01:33:29.137
THIS IS SIOUX FALLS.

01:33:29.171 --> 01:33:31.674
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

01:33:31.707 --> 01:33:33.208
LEAVENWORTH IS A TOUGH JOINT,
ISN'T IT?

01:33:33.241 --> 01:33:36.144
EVER TRY ISOLATION UNIT?

01:33:36.178 --> 01:33:38.814
NO, I DON'T THINK
I HAVE, RICHARD.

01:33:38.847 --> 01:33:40.749
YOU KNOW WHY
I'M HERE, RICHARD?

01:33:44.787 --> 01:33:46.689
D.C. SENT YOU.

01:33:46.689 --> 01:33:48.356
I KNOW THAT.

01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:49.892
THAT'S RIGHT.

01:33:49.925 --> 01:33:52.160
D.C. SENT ME, RICHARD.

01:33:54.963 --> 01:33:58.033
D.C. SENT ME CAUSE THIS
WHOLE THING'S BEEN FUCKED.

01:33:58.066 --> 01:34:00.703
YOU KNOW WHAT
I MEAN, RICHARD?

01:34:05.307 --> 01:34:08.443
AN ARRANGEMENT WAS MADE
BETWEEN YOU AND US.

01:34:08.476 --> 01:34:10.779
YOU, UH...

01:34:10.813 --> 01:34:13.716
REMEMBER THAT ARRANGEMENT,
DON'T YOU, RICHARD?

01:34:21.023 --> 01:34:23.792
I'M HERE, AIN'T I?

01:34:23.826 --> 01:34:26.328
NO. YOU'RE GONE, RICHARD.

01:34:26.361 --> 01:34:28.797
YOU RECEIVED EARLY PAROLE

01:34:28.831 --> 01:34:32.134
CONTINGENT ON NOT VIOLATING
PAROLE CONDITIONS.

01:34:32.167 --> 01:34:36.338
RIGHT. I DIDN'T
VIOLATE PAROLE.

01:34:36.371 --> 01:34:39.842
WE'LL GO OUT THE BACK DOOR
REAL SLOW.

01:34:39.875 --> 01:34:40.943
GET OUT OF THE CHAIR.

01:34:40.976 --> 01:34:43.145
WHAT IS IT
WITH YOU PEOPLE?

01:34:43.178 --> 01:34:45.347
I'M THROWN INTO ISOLATION

01:34:45.380 --> 01:34:47.315
UNTIL I DON'T KNOW
MY OWN FUCKING NAME.

01:34:47.349 --> 01:34:48.416
GET UP.

01:34:48.450 --> 01:34:49.918
THEN YOU TELL ME

01:34:49.952 --> 01:34:51.186
I CAN BEAT 20 YEARS
IF I HELPED YOU.

01:34:51.219 --> 01:34:52.320
WELL, I HELPED YOU.

01:34:52.354 --> 01:34:55.290
THE ARM'S IS GONE, MAN.

01:34:55.323 --> 01:34:57.760
GET UP!

01:34:57.760 --> 01:34:59.361
THEY SAID
I'D NEVER SEE F.B.I. AGAIN.

01:34:59.394 --> 01:35:01.797
AND I'M LIVING
WITH YOU FUCKING SCUM.

01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:03.065
WHAT IS IT
YOU WANT NOW?

01:35:03.098 --> 01:35:06.034
I DON'T FEED YOU
INFORMATION ON THE ARM

01:35:06.068 --> 01:35:09.805
OR IF I DON'T GET THE BOYS
TO MAKE TROUBLE

01:35:09.838 --> 01:35:11.506
IT'S BACK TO THE PEN.

01:35:11.539 --> 01:35:15.477
IT'S YOUR WORD
AGAINST MY WORD,
A CON INDIAN'S WORD.

01:35:15.510 --> 01:35:17.813
YOU VIOLATED PAROLE, RICHARD.

01:35:17.846 --> 01:35:20.382
WHAT THE FUCK, MAN?

01:35:20.415 --> 01:35:21.950
I DID WHAT YOU
WASI'CUS TOLD ME TO DO.

01:35:21.984 --> 01:35:24.452
YOU BLEW IT, RICHARD.

01:35:24.486 --> 01:35:26.288
YEAH, I BLEW HIS BACK OUT
WITH YOUR FUCKING HARDWARE.

01:35:28.390 --> 01:35:29.491
I'M NOT GOING BACK, MAN.

01:35:29.524 --> 01:35:31.059
ALL RIGHT.

01:35:31.093 --> 01:35:33.195
LOOK.

01:35:33.228 --> 01:35:35.931
THE MEN THAT APPROACHED YOU
AT LEAVENWORTH

01:35:35.964 --> 01:35:37.465
WHAT ARE THEIR NAMES?

01:35:37.499 --> 01:35:39.534
MAYBE I CAN DO A DEAL.

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:41.036
I DON'T KNOW.

01:35:41.069 --> 01:35:43.939
SUITS. THREE SUITS.

01:35:43.972 --> 01:35:45.407
THAT'S ALL I KNOW THEM AS.

01:35:47.009 --> 01:35:48.844
TALK TO FRANK.
HE'S THE ONE THAT SET IT UP.

01:35:48.877 --> 01:35:50.412
RIGHT. FRANK...

01:35:50.445 --> 01:35:51.914
FRANK COUTELLE WAS THERE.

01:35:51.947 --> 01:35:53.816
YEAH, FRANK COUTELLE
WAS THERE.

01:35:56.384 --> 01:35:57.485
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
WAIT.

01:35:57.519 --> 01:35:59.955
YOU'RE NOT F.B.I.

01:35:59.988 --> 01:36:01.824
I WANT TO SEE FRANK.

01:36:01.857 --> 01:36:03.959
YOU'RE NOT
A FUCKING LAW, MAN.

01:36:03.992 --> 01:36:05.861
I'M THE FUCKING LAW.

01:36:05.894 --> 01:36:07.029
OKAY.

01:36:07.062 --> 01:36:08.496
OKAY.

01:36:13.568 --> 01:36:14.502
STAY HERE.

01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:22.544
Crow Horse:
JUST STRAIGHT AHEAD
A FEW MORE MILES.

01:36:25.547 --> 01:36:27.182
AND YOU THOUGHT HE WAS
SOME CRAZY OLD COOT

01:36:27.215 --> 01:36:29.217
TALKING MYTHS AND BULLSHIT.

01:36:29.251 --> 01:36:31.386
LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, HOSS.

01:36:31.419 --> 01:36:33.088
HIS VISIONS ARE STRONG.

01:36:35.290 --> 01:36:37.559
DO THEY COME IN DREAMS,
THESE... VISIONS?

01:36:38.961 --> 01:36:40.595
YEAH, DREAMS.

01:36:40.628 --> 01:36:42.064
SOMETIMES DURING SICKNESS.

01:36:42.097 --> 01:36:43.065
SWEAT LODGE, VISION QUEST.

01:36:43.098 --> 01:36:44.266
YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN.

01:36:46.534 --> 01:36:47.970
( clearing throat )

01:36:48.003 --> 01:36:49.504
JUST BEFORE...
THEY CAUGHT JIMMY

01:36:49.537 --> 01:36:51.039
I HAD A DREAM.

01:36:51.073 --> 01:36:56.311
I WAS BEING RUN DOWN.

01:36:56.344 --> 01:36:58.546
I WAS RUNNING WITH...
OTHER INDIANS.

01:36:59.614 --> 01:37:02.217
I WAS SHOT IN THE BACK.

01:37:04.987 --> 01:37:06.454
THEN...

01:37:06.488 --> 01:37:09.091
LAST NIGHT
I DROVE PAST IT.

01:37:09.124 --> 01:37:11.393
THE PLACE IT HAPPENED.
I SAW IT.

01:37:15.230 --> 01:37:16.364
SAW WHAT?

01:37:16.398 --> 01:37:18.266
WOUNDED KNEE MEMORIAL.

01:37:22.404 --> 01:37:24.572
YOU WERE RUNNING
WITH THE OLD ONES?

01:37:24.606 --> 01:37:26.108
AT THE KNEE?

01:37:26.141 --> 01:37:27.442
IT WAS JUST A DREAM.

01:37:27.475 --> 01:37:29.577
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU, MAN?

01:37:29.611 --> 01:37:31.079
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

01:37:31.113 --> 01:37:33.481
YOU HAD YOURSELF A VISION.

01:37:33.515 --> 01:37:36.584
A MAN WAITS A LONG TIME
TO HAVE A VISION.

01:37:36.618 --> 01:37:39.421
MIGHT GO HIS WHOLE LIFETIME
AND NEVER HAVE ONE.

01:37:39.454 --> 01:37:43.058
AND ALONG COMES
SOME INSTANT INDIAN

01:37:43.091 --> 01:37:44.927
WITH A FUCKING ROLEX

01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:46.561
AND A BRAND-NEW
PAIR OF SHOES--

01:37:46.594 --> 01:37:47.996
GODDAMN F.B.I.
TO TOP IT ALL OFF--

01:37:48.030 --> 01:37:49.464
HAS HIS SELF A VISION.

01:37:49.497 --> 01:37:51.199
SORRY.

01:37:55.570 --> 01:37:57.372
AH, MAYBE IT WAS JUST
ONE OF THEM--

01:37:57.405 --> 01:37:59.942
WHAT DO YOU CALL THEM?--
FITFUL DREAMS.

01:37:59.975 --> 01:38:01.576
YEAH.

01:38:01.609 --> 01:38:03.345
FITFUL DREAMS.

01:38:07.315 --> 01:38:08.951
FITFUL DREAMS, HORSESHIT.

01:38:08.984 --> 01:38:10.552
YOU HAD YOURSELF A VISION.

01:38:10.585 --> 01:38:13.121
WHAT THE HELL
DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

01:38:16.959 --> 01:38:17.993
OH, STOP.

01:38:19.427 --> 01:38:23.398
THERE IT IS, MAN.

01:38:23.431 --> 01:38:25.533
RED DEER TABLE.

01:38:35.377 --> 01:38:36.678
( splashing )

01:38:36.711 --> 01:38:38.213
JESUS!

01:38:45.988 --> 01:38:47.155
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

01:39:01.403 --> 01:39:03.605
GODDAMN. TEST DRILLING
FOR URANIUM.

01:39:13.748 --> 01:39:16.051
LOOK AT THAT.

01:39:16.084 --> 01:39:18.186
IT'S SEALANT.

01:39:18.220 --> 01:39:20.688
OUR PEOPLE HAVE BEEN VOTING
AGAINST THIS MINING THING

01:39:20.722 --> 01:39:22.590
FOR YEARS.

01:39:22.624 --> 01:39:24.559
NATIONAL SECURITY.

01:39:28.130 --> 01:39:29.731
DOES MILTON OWN
THIS LAND?

01:39:29.764 --> 01:39:31.566
HE'D LIKE TO.

01:39:31.599 --> 01:39:34.702
HE JUST GETS KICKBACKS
OFF THE DAMN LEASES.

01:39:36.238 --> 01:39:38.240
HOW COULD NO ONE KNOW?

01:39:38.273 --> 01:39:39.707
BECAUSE YOUR GOVERNMENT

01:39:39.741 --> 01:39:42.244
PUSHED OUR PEOPLE
OFF THIS LAND YEARS AGO, RAY.

01:39:42.277 --> 01:39:44.246
AND MILTON AND HIS GOONS
ARE MAKING SURE

01:39:44.279 --> 01:39:46.481
THAT WE DON'T COME BACK.

01:39:46.514 --> 01:39:49.217
SO LEO FOUND OUT ABOUT IT
AND DIDN'T LIKE IT

01:39:49.251 --> 01:39:51.186
AND WENT TO MAGGIE.

01:39:51.219 --> 01:39:54.122
SO THEY ZAPPED HIM
AND PINNED IT ON JIMMY

01:39:54.156 --> 01:39:55.757
TO DESTROY ARM.

01:39:55.790 --> 01:39:57.759
YEAH.

01:39:57.792 --> 01:39:59.494
THEY'RE THE ONLY PEOPLE
WHO'D DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT

01:40:01.329 --> 01:40:04.266
AND YOUR PEOPLE
SUPPLIED MILTON
AND HIS GOONS.

01:40:04.299 --> 01:40:06.468
THEY'RE NOT MY PEOPLE.

01:40:06.501 --> 01:40:11.606
GODDAMN IT, RAY.
THE SOURCE.

01:40:11.639 --> 01:40:14.742
THE LITTLE WALKING
STARTS HERE.

01:40:14.776 --> 01:40:17.345
THAT'S WHAT'S CONTAMINATED
THE WATER.

01:40:17.379 --> 01:40:19.647
THEY GO AHEAD WITH THIS
STRIP-MINING THING

01:40:19.681 --> 01:40:22.617
AND THIS RESERVATION'S
A DEAD ZONE.

01:40:24.319 --> 01:40:26.721
WE GOT TO GET YOU
OFF THE RES.

01:40:26.754 --> 01:40:30.092
WE GOT TO GET YELLOW HAWK
OFF THE RES.

01:40:30.125 --> 01:40:32.360
( animals snarling )

01:40:38.800 --> 01:40:40.302
( gun cocking )

01:40:49.377 --> 01:40:51.246
( coyotes
barking and snarling )

01:41:06.528 --> 01:41:08.596
MILTON'S BOYS
HAVE BEEN HERE.

01:41:14.202 --> 01:41:15.770
WALTER.

01:41:31.619 --> 01:41:33.488
OH, NO.

01:41:33.521 --> 01:41:35.357
OH.

01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:37.725
OH, NO.

01:41:43.631 --> 01:41:45.800
AH...

01:42:30.245 --> 01:42:31.846
SHIT.

01:43:01.376 --> 01:43:02.877
RAY.

01:43:40.482 --> 01:43:41.916
Cooch:
Hold your fire.
I want him alive.

01:43:59.734 --> 01:44:01.603
( children screaming )

01:44:49.951 --> 01:44:51.453
RAY.

01:44:51.486 --> 01:44:53.020
YOU LISTENING TO ME?

01:44:53.054 --> 01:44:55.357
THIS IS INSUBORDINATION,
AND IT'S FUTILE.

01:44:55.390 --> 01:44:57.859
You're under duress.

01:44:57.892 --> 01:44:58.960
I can understand that.

01:44:58.993 --> 01:45:01.028
Just pull over
and we'll talk about it.

01:45:01.062 --> 01:45:02.397
THAT'S ALL I'M ASKING.

01:45:02.430 --> 01:45:03.565
JUST STOP THE CAR.

01:45:09.103 --> 01:45:11.005
BETTER GET THE RAPID CITY
FEDERALS BACK OUT HERE.

01:45:11.038 --> 01:45:12.740
MARSHALS.

01:45:12.774 --> 01:45:14.108
WE DON'T WANT
A GODDAMNED MEDIA EVENT.

01:45:14.141 --> 01:45:16.378
CONTAIN ALL RESERVATION EXITS.

01:45:16.378 --> 01:45:17.879
IT'S UNDER CONTROL.

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:36.097
YELLOW HAWK IS GOING TO SING.

01:45:36.130 --> 01:45:38.666
YELLOW HAWK COMMITTED SUICIDE
AT 3:06 THIS MORNING.

01:45:38.700 --> 01:45:39.867
You hear me?

01:45:39.901 --> 01:45:41.503
Stop the car, Ray.

01:45:41.536 --> 01:45:43.405
Ray:
You blew it, Richard.

01:45:43.438 --> 01:45:45.139
Yellow Hawk:
I blew him out
with your hardware.

01:45:45.172 --> 01:45:48.776
I'm not going back, man.

01:45:48.810 --> 01:45:50.044
The men
that approached you

01:45:50.077 --> 01:45:51.446
at Leavenworth,
what are their names?

01:45:51.479 --> 01:45:53.581
Maybe I can do a deal.

01:45:53.615 --> 01:45:55.550
Suits. Three suits.

01:45:55.583 --> 01:45:56.851
That's all
I know them as.

01:45:56.884 --> 01:45:59.086
Talk to Frank.
He set it up.

01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:01.556
Right, Frank.
Frank Coutelle was there.

01:46:01.589 --> 01:46:04.025
Yeah, Frank Coutelle
was there.

01:46:04.058 --> 01:46:07.161
( tape rewinding )

01:46:07.194 --> 01:46:09.030
...Frank.
He set it up.

01:46:09.063 --> 01:46:11.799
Right, Frank.
Frank Coutelle was there.

01:46:11.833 --> 01:46:13.067
Yeah, Frank Coutelle
was there.

01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:15.036
ALWAYS GET TAPE, FRANK.

01:46:15.069 --> 01:46:16.504
THANKS.

01:46:41.663 --> 01:46:42.964
PUT YOUR SEAT BELT ON.

01:46:53.975 --> 01:46:55.209
WHERE THE HELL...

01:46:55.242 --> 01:46:56.711
LET'S GO.

01:46:56.744 --> 01:46:59.614
HE'S GONE NATIVE ON US.
JESUS CHRIST.

01:47:08.089 --> 01:47:11.158
IF HE GETS OFF THE RES,
WE'VE GOT COMPLICATIONS.

01:47:11.192 --> 01:47:12.927
HE'S NOT GETTING OFF
THE RES.

01:47:19.801 --> 01:47:21.002
THEY GOT US SEALED IN.

01:47:21.035 --> 01:47:23.838
WHERE THE HELL
ARE YOU GOING?

01:47:23.871 --> 01:47:25.172
STRONGHOLD.

01:47:25.206 --> 01:47:26.741
WHAT?

01:47:26.774 --> 01:47:28.042
WE'RE HEADING
FOR THE STRONGHOLD.

01:47:28.075 --> 01:47:29.511
AW, SHIT.

01:47:32.279 --> 01:47:34.248
WHERE THE HELL
IS HE GOING?

01:47:34.281 --> 01:47:36.183
NOWHERE.

01:47:36.217 --> 01:47:38.185
IT'S A WALL.

01:47:41.989 --> 01:47:43.157
IS THAT IT?

01:47:43.190 --> 01:47:44.091
YEAH, YEAH.

01:48:00.074 --> 01:48:01.208
WHOA...

01:48:01.242 --> 01:48:02.844
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

01:48:02.877 --> 01:48:05.547
EASY, EASY!

01:48:05.580 --> 01:48:06.681
AW, SHIT!

01:48:13.788 --> 01:48:15.757
( coughing )

01:48:18.793 --> 01:48:20.562
RAY!

01:48:34.976 --> 01:48:36.243
LET'S TALK, RAY.

01:48:40.582 --> 01:48:42.584
LET'S TALK
ABOUT RED DEER TABLE.

01:48:44.719 --> 01:48:46.688
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

01:48:46.721 --> 01:48:48.923
WHY DID WE KILL
LEO FAST ELK?

01:48:48.956 --> 01:48:51.859
WHY MAGGIE'S
LYING UP THERE DEAD?

01:48:51.893 --> 01:48:54.962
YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING
TO YOUR LAND?

01:49:05.807 --> 01:49:07.709
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
TO YOURSELF, RAY?

01:49:07.742 --> 01:49:09.043
WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO YOU?

01:49:09.076 --> 01:49:11.112
THEY'RE DRILLING URANIUM
UP THERE.

01:49:11.145 --> 01:49:12.313
Cooch:
THAT'S RESTRICTED MATERIAL.

01:49:12.346 --> 01:49:14.248
GIVE ME THE TAPE.

01:49:14.281 --> 01:49:16.618
IT'S CONTAMINATED MATERIAL.

01:49:16.618 --> 01:49:19.320
YOUR DEAL GOES THROUGH
WITH MILTON, YOU'RE ALL DEAD.

01:49:19.353 --> 01:49:21.088
HE'S LYING!

01:49:21.122 --> 01:49:22.990
IT'S IN THE RIVER.

01:49:23.024 --> 01:49:24.358
HEY, LOOK.

01:49:24.391 --> 01:49:26.093
WE CAME HERE TO APPREHEND
A MURDERER.

01:49:26.127 --> 01:49:27.862
NOW IT'S ALL OVER.

01:49:27.895 --> 01:49:30.898
YOU CAME HERE
TO BROKER A LAND DEAL

01:49:30.932 --> 01:49:33.635
AND TO ELIMINATE
ANYONE WHO KNOWS.

01:49:36.070 --> 01:49:37.839
EVEN THE SCHOOLTEACHER?

01:49:37.872 --> 01:49:39.874
A SCHOOLTEACHER, FRANK?

01:49:39.907 --> 01:49:42.343
( Ray panting )

01:49:49.050 --> 01:49:51.285
WHAT DO YOU WANT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

01:49:51.318 --> 01:49:54.188
YOU WANT AN ADVISORY POSITION,
GRADE TEN?

01:49:54.221 --> 01:49:55.790
I CAN ARRANGE THAT
IN DENVER.

01:49:55.823 --> 01:49:56.958
SENSITIVE OPERATIONS UNIT.

01:49:56.991 --> 01:49:58.159
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

01:49:58.192 --> 01:49:59.761
PEOPLE KNOW.

01:49:59.794 --> 01:50:01.929
YOU CAN'T KILL ALL OF US.

01:50:01.963 --> 01:50:03.898
PEOPLE KNOW.

01:50:03.931 --> 01:50:05.867
I CAN EITHER HELP YOU...

01:50:05.900 --> 01:50:08.269
OR I CAN SEND YOU BACK
TO YOUR ANCESTORS.

01:50:08.302 --> 01:50:10.371
WHICH WAY IS IT
GOING TO BE?

01:50:13.941 --> 01:50:15.910
HUH?

01:50:27.388 --> 01:50:30.157
COME ON.
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE.

01:50:39.033 --> 01:50:40.768
RAY!

01:51:02.056 --> 01:51:05.192
( chanting )

01:51:05.226 --> 01:51:07.862
( rifles cocking )

01:51:07.895 --> 01:51:10.865
( drums beating )

01:51:10.898 --> 01:51:14.736
( chanting )

01:51:49.403 --> 01:51:51.773
THIS LAND
IS NOT FOR SALE.

01:52:31.512 --> 01:52:34.015
SHE SHOULD HAVE
BEEN THERE.

01:52:34.048 --> 01:52:35.950
SHE WAS, RAY.

01:52:35.983 --> 01:52:37.919
SHE WAS THERE.

01:52:48.129 --> 01:52:50.331
SO WHAT HAPPENS
TO COOCH NOW?

01:52:50.364 --> 01:52:52.399
INTERNAL SECURITY
INVESTIGATION.

01:52:54.335 --> 01:52:56.337
YOU MEAN WHITEWASH.

01:52:56.370 --> 01:52:58.405
"DO NOT FILE."

01:52:58.439 --> 01:53:00.407
BUT I'M GOING TO...

01:53:03.978 --> 01:53:06.313
GET A HOLD OF MAGGIE'S
MEDIA CONTACTS.

01:53:06.347 --> 01:53:08.515
WE'LL SEE WHAT KIND
OF A STORY WE CAN TELL.

01:53:08.549 --> 01:53:11.085
YEAH.

01:53:11.118 --> 01:53:14.055
SO NOW THAT YOU'RE
UNEMPLOYED, LITTLE WEASEL

01:53:15.222 --> 01:53:17.191
WHERE ARE YOU
GOING TO GO?

01:53:17.224 --> 01:53:19.060
I DON'T KNOW.

01:53:19.093 --> 01:53:21.863
WE'LL HAVE TO SEE
WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT THAT.

01:53:21.863 --> 01:53:22.964
WHO'S THEY?

01:53:22.997 --> 01:53:24.398
YOU KNOW.

01:53:26.267 --> 01:53:28.269
YOU DIDN'T HAVE
ANOTHER VISION, DID YOU?

01:53:35.877 --> 01:53:39.180
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF,
CROW HORSE.

01:53:39.213 --> 01:53:41.916
IF YOU EVER, UH... NEED
A PLACE TO COME BACK TO...

01:53:41.949 --> 01:53:44.285
YOU KNOW, LISTEN TO THE WIND.

01:53:44.318 --> 01:53:46.253
WE'LL BE HERE.

01:53:49.556 --> 01:53:50.892
LISTEN, UH...

01:53:54.128 --> 01:53:56.163
THERE AIN'T NO WORD
IN SIOUX FOR "GOOD-BYE."

01:53:57.364 --> 01:53:59.200
LOOK AFTER YOURSELF, RAY.

01:55:05.032 --> 01:55:07.068
( chuckling )
