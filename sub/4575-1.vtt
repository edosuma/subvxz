02:14.300 --> 02:15.100
Die ...

02:15.400 --> 02:18.700
you ... son of a bitch!

02:30.800 --> 02:31.700
Jamie ...

02:31.800 --> 02:33.800
I want you to stay in the car.

02:45.300 --> 02:46.300
Jamie!

02:46.600 --> 02:48.800
Get away!
- Don't touch him, Jamie!

02:51.200 --> 02:52.100
That's him.

02:52.200 --> 02:53.500
Don't hit the girl.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.200
Get down!

03:14.100 --> 03:15.600
I don't get it, what happened?

03:19.200 --> 03:20.400
He's gotta be down there!

03:36.300 --> 03:36.700
Do it!

03:37.300 --> 03:38.100
Stand back!

04:42.500 --> 04:44.100
Quiet, Tuki.

04:45.900 --> 04:47.400
Be quiet!

05:26.500 --> 05:28.600
There's nothing out there, Tuki.

06:16.200 --> 06:16.800
No.

06:21.900 --> 06:22.700
No!

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
Come on, Jamie.
Your bath is ready.

06:42.900 --> 06:43.600
No!

06:49.200 --> 06:50.800
Jamie! No!

06:55.600 --> 06:56.900
It's all right.

06:57.200 --> 06:58.900
It's all right, darling.

06:59.800 --> 07:01.100
Oh, Jamie.

07:02.200 --> 07:02.600
Jamie ...

07:03.100 --> 07:04.100
Jamie!

07:04.200 --> 07:07.300
It's just another one of your nightmares, that's all!

07:07.400 --> 07:09.400
Oh ...
Oh.

07:09.500 --> 07:12.000
Oh, darling. Look at me, look at me.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.000
Do you want me to call your mom?

07:15.000 --> 07:15.700
Oh!

07:16.800 --> 07:19.400
Oh, Jamie.
Jamie.

07:41.700 --> 07:43.300
I'll call the doctor.

08:32.100 --> 08:32.799
Oh, Jamie!

08:33.000 --> 08:34.600
Oh, Jamie!

08:34.700 --> 08:37.400
Jamie!
Doctor!

08:40.000 --> 08:41.100
Get a gurney!

08:41.299 --> 08:42.799
Somebody!

08:43.700 --> 08:44.800
Come on!
- Okay.

08:45.000 --> 08:45.800
Yeah. It's ready.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.500
Go! ... Go!
- Jamie ...

08:49.600 --> 08:50.500
... breathe!

08:50.800 --> 08:52.200
Breathe, Jamie!

08:52.700 --> 08:53.900
Jamie, breathe.

08:54.000 --> 08:57.400
Prep e.r.! Tracheotomy. Go!
- No!

08:57.700 --> 08:59.900
Hang on, Jamie. Jamie, Jamie, Jamie.

09:00.900 --> 09:02.800
All right, down.
- There you go.

09:02.900 --> 09:04.400
Easy, easy, easy, doc.

09:05.900 --> 09:07.900
You got her up there?
- Yeah. Steady, steady.

09:14.200 --> 09:15.400
She needs oxygen!

09:16.500 --> 09:17.900
All right, unstrap her.

09:21.100 --> 09:22.000
All right.

09:33.200 --> 09:34.100
No!

09:34.600 --> 09:35.900
No!
- What are you doing?

09:36.000 --> 09:38.400
Leave her!
- This girl is dying!

09:39.300 --> 09:43.700
I have to open her trachea, for God's sake!
- She will stabilize.
- She's dying!

09:43.800 --> 09:44.900
No.

09:53.700 --> 09:54.700
Do you see?

09:55.300 --> 09:58.000
I see you still want this girl dead.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.500
She has something to tell us.

10:30.300 --> 10:32.200
Hey there, funny face.

10:36.400 --> 10:37.300
What?

10:41.300 --> 10:42.300
Thank you.

10:45.800 --> 10:49.300
Hey! Hey, open up!

10:50.300 --> 10:50.900
Max!

10:51.100 --> 10:52.300
Max!

10:53.300 --> 10:56.200
They don't allow Max in here.
- Get in there, Max.

10:57.700 --> 10:58.200
You know.

10:58.300 --> 11:00.600
You know what they can do if they can't take a joke.

11:00.900 --> 11:02.600
She doesn't even remember.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.300
Is she really better?

11:06.800 --> 11:09.200
Hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

11:11.400 --> 11:13.700
Give me some of this action, baby.

11:15.600 --> 11:16.600
What?

11:20.200 --> 11:23.400
I wonder what Rachel's hiding
behind door number three.

11:36.700 --> 11:39.300
It looks so good. It'll be so cute.

11:41.500 --> 11:42.400
Billy ...

11:42.500 --> 11:45.600
... is going to have to fight off a lot of boys.
- Billy is gonna freak.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.600
What is going on here?

11:54.900 --> 11:56.700
Gee. I'm sorry.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.200
Come on, Max. Here.

11:58.900 --> 12:01.100
Bye, sweetie, love you.

12:05.800 --> 12:08.500
I'll be back in two days ... okay?

12:10.400 --> 12:12.000
Mom and dad send their love.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.400
How could they?

12:41.900 --> 12:45.200
When are they gonna realize that she is not him?
She's just a child.

12:45.300 --> 12:48.100
They know that Michael Myers is her uncle.

12:48.500 --> 12:52.000
And that she attacked her stepmother.
That's why they fear her.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.300
Especially on Halloween.

12:55.100 --> 12:57.400
I never should've let my parents talk me into leaving.

12:57.500 --> 12:59.200
I don't know, what I was thinking.

12:59.300 --> 13:01.700
You are afraid and ..
- I am not.

13:01.800 --> 13:06.100
You're afraid the whole thing might start ...
to happen again.

13:07.200 --> 13:09.800
There's nothing wrong with being afraid.

13:09.900 --> 13:13.600
And I suppose there's nothing wrong
with just leaving my little stepsister here alone.

13:13.700 --> 13:15.800
You can telephone her from the cabin.

13:16.600 --> 13:18.600
She'll be properly looked after.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.100
Then why do I still feel guilty?

13:24.000 --> 13:26.100
I'm worried about Jamie.
- So, stick around.

13:26.200 --> 13:30.300
I already promised my parents.
- Promises were made to be broken, babe. - I don't know.

13:30.500 --> 13:35.600
The farm's parties always rock. Think about it.
- Okay. -  I gotta jet. Bye.
- Bye.

13:35.700 --> 13:38.500
I'll be back with the outfits.
- See you, Tina.

13:38.800 --> 13:40.200
Max!

13:42.300 --> 13:43.200
Max, what is it?

13:43.300 --> 13:44.800
Come on, Max.

13:46.000 --> 13:47.400
Oh, come on.

14:13.500 --> 14:14.800
Come on, Max!

14:16.800 --> 14:17.600
Come on.

14:17.900 --> 14:18.800
Yes.

14:33.100 --> 14:35.000
Here. You want this?
- That's mine.

14:36.100 --> 14:39.700
I want the green one.
- I used to like this. - Here is the red one.

14:46.800 --> 14:49.100
I don't want the scissors.
- It's mine.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.100
I got the hook on them.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.600
Shut up, Max!

15:08.400 --> 15:09.400
It's a joke.

15:17.700 --> 15:19.900
Jamie?
- Max!

15:20.200 --> 15:21.200
Max?

15:22.100 --> 15:23.700
What'd she say?
- Okay.

15:26.100 --> 15:27.300
All right!

15:29.000 --> 15:30.700
Hold on a minute!

15:34.500 --> 15:35.900
All right!

15:38.100 --> 15:39.300
I'm coming!

15:40.200 --> 15:41.000
Hello?

15:42.000 --> 15:43.200
Are you all right?

15:43.300 --> 15:45.300
Yeah, I'm fine.
I was just in the shower.

15:45.300 --> 15:47.900
Is ... is Max all right?

15:48.600 --> 15:51.500
Max is having fun.
He's been barking at a cat all morning.

15:51.600 --> 15:52.700
Go and check him.

15:52.800 --> 15:55.600
Well, why?
- Go and check him, now!

15:56.900 --> 15:57.700
All right.

15:58.900 --> 16:01.800
All right. Hold on.
I have to go downstairs.

16:02.900 --> 16:04.200
Oh, brother.

16:41.400 --> 16:42.400
Rachel?

16:45.400 --> 16:46.700
<i>Dr. Loomis ...</i>

16:48.500 --> 16:49.800
Max is gone.

16:50.700 --> 16:51.600
Listen to me.

16:51.700 --> 16:56.200
<i>Drop the phone, go to the nearest store.
Get out of the house.
Quickly! Now. Go on!</i>

17:06.900 --> 17:08.200
Mr. Cornet!

17:20.400 --> 17:21.700
Better find that out.

17:24.300 --> 17:26.300
All clear. Nothing above, nothing below.

17:26.900 --> 17:28.500
What about Max?

17:29.000 --> 17:30.400
A dobie, right?

17:31.900 --> 17:34.400
This is not happening to me.
Max!

17:35.200 --> 17:37.000
Max, what have you done?

17:37.600 --> 17:39.600
I'm so embarrassed.
- That's what we're here for.

17:39.700 --> 17:42.800
Rescue cats. - Find dogs.
- That's our job. - And we love it.

17:46.800 --> 17:47.600
Think so.

17:49.100 --> 17:51.000
<i>Bye, sweetie.
I love you.</i>

17:51.600 --> 17:52.700
<i>You be a good girl.</i>

17:52.800 --> 17:53.900
<i>Bye.</i>

18:00.100 --> 18:03.100
So, she was perfectly all right.

18:06.300 --> 18:07.400
Come on, Billy.

18:08.300 --> 18:10.900
I think Jamie needs to get some rest.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.900
Jamie, are y-you okay?

18:16.700 --> 18:17.500
Come on.

18:36.900 --> 18:39.100
You sense something, don't you?

18:40.600 --> 18:41.900
Tell me.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.700
Tell me what you know!

18:44.700 --> 18:47.100
Here, write. Write! Write!

18:50.100 --> 18:51.700
Write, what you know.

18:52.900 --> 18:54.700
Jamie, please!

18:56.700 --> 18:57.900
Please.

19:29.600 --> 19:30.900
Yeah.

19:48.000 --> 19:49.500
Max?

20:12.400 --> 20:13.400
Max?

20:58.300 --> 20:59.000
No!

21:06.000 --> 21:09.500
The tetanea should've taken effect by now.
Another dose might stop her heart.

21:11.900 --> 21:13.200
She was shaking!

21:13.600 --> 21:15.600
Her whole body was shaking!

21:16.300 --> 21:19.300
Every time a little girl twitches,
I'm supposed to call out the National Guard.

21:19.400 --> 21:23.000
How many people did he kill last year?
Have you forgotten?

21:24.000 --> 21:27.900
Your own daughter. - I don't.
- No! Of course you don't forget!

21:28.400 --> 21:29.900
How could you?

21:29.900 --> 21:31.900
But you never looked into his face, did you?

21:32.100 --> 21:33.900
You never saw his eyes.

21:34.100 --> 21:35.500
You never saw that ...

21:35.600 --> 21:36.900
... nothing ...

21:37.100 --> 21:38.600
No expression.

21:38.800 --> 21:39.900
Blank.

21:40.300 --> 21:43.000
My memory goes back 12 years ...

21:43.100 --> 21:44.700
to the night when I offered ...

21:45.500 --> 21:46.700
I'm gonna show you.

21:46.900 --> 21:50.200
Show you something.
Look, look. Look at this.

21:50.800 --> 21:51.800
Look at that.

21:53.700 --> 21:55.100
I prayed ...

21:55.500 --> 21:58.400
That he would burn ... in hell.

21:58.800 --> 22:00.700
But in my heart ...

22:01.600 --> 22:04.700
I knew that hell would not have him.

22:05.400 --> 22:06.300
Sheriff?

22:10.000 --> 22:12.000
They want you down at the cemetery.

22:25.200 --> 22:26.100
Rache?

22:27.800 --> 22:29.100
Rache?

22:37.300 --> 22:39.400
Maxie!

22:42.500 --> 22:44.100
Chill out, Max.

22:45.600 --> 22:47.600
I'll get your water in a second.

22:51.100 --> 22:52.100
Rache?

22:55.000 --> 22:55.700
Rachel?

22:57.700 --> 22:59.000
Rachel? Rachel?

23:01.900 --> 23:03.700
Rachel. I got you a present.

23:05.100 --> 23:06.400
Rachel!

23:12.900 --> 23:13.800
Rachel?

23:20.900 --> 23:22.300
Rachel!

23:32.200 --> 23:33.200
Rachel?

23:43.700 --> 23:45.900
Gonna miss you, baby!

24:37.200 --> 24:39.800
Sammy!

24:56.100 --> 25:00.100
It's Halloween, right?
- Can you believe we have this whole house
to ourselves for the weekend?

25:00.500 --> 25:03.000
But Tina, that's what you've said before, remember?

25:03.200 --> 25:06.200
Oh, Sammy, are all your circuits on hold or what?

25:11.100 --> 25:13.500
Tina, I thought Rachel was lurking around.

25:13.600 --> 25:14.800
Oh, I did too ...

25:15.000 --> 25:18.300
But I guess she decided to go up to the
country with her parents.

25:18.800 --> 25:21.600
Oh, Max!
Shut your canine trap!

25:22.300 --> 25:24.800
What if my mom calls and finds out ...

25:24.900 --> 25:26.400
... Rachel's not here with us, huh?

25:27.200 --> 25:29.100
Just joking!

25:54.500 --> 25:57.100
Sammy, why don't you bag spitz tonight?

25:57.600 --> 26:01.000
I couldn't do that.- Oh, sure you could.
- Oh, no, I can't.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.800
Come on. Ooh, you're blushing.

26:04.500 --> 26:05.500
Come on.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.900
Come on. You can't hide anything from me.

26:10.700 --> 26:12.200
Come on.
- This may be it.

26:12.600 --> 26:13.400
"It"?

26:14.700 --> 26:15.800
What are you saying?

26:16.900 --> 26:19.400
I can't talk to you about this.
- Oh, come on.

26:19.400 --> 26:23.000
Come on. I mean, you're planning something.
What are we talking here like ...

26:23.200 --> 26:24.300
candles and ...

26:24.400 --> 26:25.500
... and a ...

26:27.200 --> 26:29.200
sensual massage and ...

26:29.700 --> 26:31.200
leopard sheets.

26:31.200 --> 26:32.600
Satin.

26:33.300 --> 26:35.800
Satin sheets?
- They're Rachel's!

26:38.300 --> 26:40.100
I just flipped my skirt!

26:40.200 --> 26:42.300
What do you want me to do?
What can I do? What can I do? I mean ...

26:42.400 --> 26:45.200
Do you wanna make up signals or something?
- Enough!

26:46.600 --> 26:49.300
What? Come on.
You guys can have the house to yourselves.

26:49.700 --> 26:50.800
It's cool.

26:51.700 --> 26:53.700
Mikey and I like it in the car.

26:57.800 --> 27:00.800
Oh, honey. Don't worry about it.
- I'm not worried.

27:01.400 --> 27:04.000
I've just been in
a weird mood all day.

27:04.600 --> 27:06.900
Everybody in this town is in a weird mood.

27:07.300 --> 27:09.700
They should ban Halloween in this town.

27:12.700 --> 27:14.200
Michael!

27:14.700 --> 27:15.700
What?!

27:27.200 --> 27:27.800
Hi.

27:29.800 --> 27:31.900
Hey, you're just in time to give us a ride.

27:34.400 --> 27:37.200
Come on, Sammy.
He's sorry about last weekend.

27:38.400 --> 27:39.700
Aren't you, Mikey?

27:39.900 --> 27:40.800
No.

27:42.400 --> 27:43.300
See?

27:43.700 --> 27:45.900
Tina, I thought you wanted to see Jamie.

27:46.400 --> 27:48.000
Look, you're killing me, babe.

27:48.700 --> 27:50.200
Would you just get in?

27:50.500 --> 27:52.100
We can go later, right Mikey?

27:52.400 --> 27:53.000
Right?

29:54.400 --> 29:55.400
It's all right.

29:55.700 --> 29:57.200
It's all right.

30:00.700 --> 30:03.000
What are you doing down here?

30:05.100 --> 30:08.000
Come on. Come on. It's okay.
- There you are.

30:08.100 --> 30:10.500
We've been looking all over for you.

30:10.600 --> 30:11.600
Come to me, baby.

30:11.800 --> 30:12.600
Come on.

30:14.300 --> 30:15.300
What happened?

30:16.000 --> 30:17.900
Was it one of your dreams again?

30:19.000 --> 30:20.000
Okay, come on.

30:22.600 --> 30:24.300
You gotta help me, Jamie.

30:25.100 --> 30:27.100
You gotta help me to find him.

30:28.100 --> 30:30.400
We both know he's alive.

30:30.600 --> 30:33.200
But you know where he is!

30:34.000 --> 30:35.100
Why?

30:35.700 --> 30:38.000
Why are you protecting him?

30:39.700 --> 30:40.700
Why?

30:42.200 --> 30:44.700
What about your stepmother, Jamie?

30:44.800 --> 30:48.100
You love her, don't you?
He made you stab her.

30:52.100 --> 30:55.500
You cannot hide from him.
He'll always get to you.

30:57.500 --> 30:59.500
Jamie.
Jamie, listen.

31:00.500 --> 31:02.600
Today in the cemetery ...

31:03.300 --> 31:05.800
... somebody dug up a coffin.

31:06.500 --> 31:10.300
It was a coffin of a nine-year-old girl.

31:11.800 --> 31:15.200
What do you think he's going to do with that?!

31:18.900 --> 31:20.700
You're nine years old ...

31:21.400 --> 31:22.900
... aren't you, Jamie?

31:23.000 --> 31:24.500
Dr. Loomis ...

31:24.700 --> 31:26.700
Leave the little girl alone.

31:30.700 --> 31:33.000
Tears won't get you anywhere.

31:35.900 --> 31:37.700
Help me to find him.

31:38.600 --> 31:40.800
We'll find him together!

31:43.100 --> 31:46.600
There's a reason, why he has this power over you.

31:48.700 --> 31:51.000
Did you ever wonder what it is?

31:54.000 --> 31:54.900
Baby?

32:09.000 --> 32:10.000
He's still inside.

32:10.600 --> 32:12.500
Okay.
- Excuse me.

32:12.600 --> 32:16.300
Where is the bus stop for Chicago?
- Let's see, are you going to the Blooming Hill?

33:09.400 --> 33:10.500
Michael?

33:25.500 --> 33:27.000
Have you come home ...

33:27.100 --> 33:28.500
... Michael?

33:30.800 --> 33:33.300
I know what you want from her.

36:05.100 --> 36:07.400
Don't you like the mask just a little bit?

36:08.800 --> 36:12.200
Yeah, maybe you don't even need to wear a mask, baby.

36:17.300 --> 36:20.200
* Baby, I'm yours *

36:21.100 --> 36:23.100
* Baby, I'm ready *

36:24.000 --> 36:25.300
Bruised, but ready.

36:26.200 --> 36:27.000
Hi.

36:41.500 --> 36:42.400
Friends of yours?

36:47.000 --> 36:49.400
So, how many cases can we get?
- Three cases.

36:49.500 --> 36:52.500
Any more, I think old Mr. Casey
would know something's up.

36:52.800 --> 36:55.100
But we gotta get going.
Shift changes pretty soon.

36:57.200 --> 37:00.200
You gonna pull around back
or should we both get busted out front here?

37:02.800 --> 37:03.700
Oh, Mike.

37:05.200 --> 37:06.600
Nice wax job.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.100
You touch the car again and you're dead.

37:09.200 --> 37:10.100
Okay?

37:10.400 --> 37:11.000
Okay.

37:11.500 --> 37:12.300
Thank you.

37:14.300 --> 37:16.500
You're gonna get high blood pressure, Mikey.

37:16.600 --> 37:18.200
Pick me up at 8:00 at Rachel's, okay?

37:18.300 --> 37:20.700
We gotta get ready for the tower farm party.

37:21.000 --> 37:21.900
Hey Mikey ...

37:22.100 --> 37:23.800
wanna go have your legs waxed?

37:41.900 --> 37:43.500
All right, that's it. Now, go, go, go.
And don't drink it all before we get there, okay?

37:49.500 --> 37:50.500
Idiot.

38:14.200 --> 38:15.000
What the ...

38:18.600 --> 38:20.100
Okay, asshole.

38:20.500 --> 38:22.000
You wanna play?!

38:24.700 --> 38:26.200
Trick or treat!

38:45.700 --> 38:46.800
Three, two, one.

38:47.000 --> 38:48.300
Can you hear me up here?

38:49.300 --> 38:50.900
Testing: one, two, three.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.700
Ooh, my.
Aren't you pretty?

39:04.900 --> 39:07.100
These are ...
for you.

39:12.200 --> 39:13.900
Aren't they beautiful?

39:14.800 --> 39:16.600
We'll have to put them in water.

39:23.200 --> 39:24.000
... yeah.
- It's great.

39:29.600 --> 39:30.300
It ...

39:30.500 --> 39:33.000
It's ... good luck.

39:39.700 --> 39:42.500
First of all I'd like to thank you parents for supporting ...

39:42.700 --> 39:47.300
... us tonight. Now, what we've all been waiting for
our annual Halloween ...

39:47.500 --> 39:53.200
... costume pageant! Our first couple is Jenny Hogel
and Christian McGint. Give them a big hand.

40:37.300 --> 40:41.300
Next is Tony Larkin and Diane Lewis.
- Jamie, come on.

40:45.600 --> 40:46.600
Tina!

40:46.800 --> 40:49.200
Queen of room service.

40:55.400 --> 40:57.900
Michael, open the door.

40:59.700 --> 41:00.400
Mike!

41:02.700 --> 41:07.500
Michael, it's cold out here!
Come on, open the door!

41:09.100 --> 41:10.300
Mikey.

41:12.600 --> 41:13.700
Mikey.

41:17.100 --> 41:19.200
Thank you for being such a gentleman.

41:20.100 --> 41:23.600
And now we have Billy Hill and Jamie Groder.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.300
You're wearing my present.

41:31.200 --> 41:32.700
I want you to know ...

41:34.100 --> 41:36.600
I just love barbaric men.

41:38.900 --> 41:42.900
Jamie as a princess. Give her a big hand.
- Jamie.

41:43.100 --> 41:43.900
Jamie.

41:44.500 --> 41:45.800
Jamie, come on.

41:46.100 --> 41:48.400
Michael, don't I even get a kiss?

41:59.400 --> 42:01.000
Well, I can't resist your new look.

42:03.200 --> 42:04.400
Jamie, come on.

42:13.600 --> 42:15.000
It feels creepy.

42:25.300 --> 42:27.500
I think. I think she's gonna fall down!

42:28.900 --> 42:29.600
Jamie.

42:34.800 --> 42:35.600
Jamie!

42:38.200 --> 42:39.100
Jamie!

42:45.000 --> 42:46.200
Just great.

42:46.400 --> 42:48.300
The old silent treatment, huh, Mike?

42:48.400 --> 42:50.700
What'd I do wrong this time, huh?

42:51.600 --> 42:53.800
Is it because I wanna see Jamie?

42:57.400 --> 43:01.200
Nothing, Mike. That's what I get. Nothing!

43:03.700 --> 43:05.500
Stop here. I want a pack of cigarettes.

43:08.000 --> 43:12.000
I said, stop the goddamn car!
I want a pack of cigarettes!

43:18.400 --> 43:19.300
Come on.

43:29.600 --> 43:30.400
Great.

43:30.900 --> 43:32.900
Psycho boyfriend.

43:39.600 --> 43:40.500
Jamie.

43:40.700 --> 43:45.600
Tina. Is she in danger? Where is she?
- No. We gotta get her arm.
- Where is she?

43:45.900 --> 43:48.300
Tina. Where is she, Jamie?

43:55.000 --> 43:55.800
Jamie.

43:55.900 --> 43:57.500
You've got to help us!

43:58.300 --> 44:00.000
Get Meeker on the line.

44:00.600 --> 44:02.200
Sergeant Meeker, what's your 20?
- St ... ore!

44:05.800 --> 44:07.200
Store!

44:08.400 --> 44:09.500
Store?

44:11.500 --> 44:13.800
What kind of store?
What do they sell there?

44:15.700 --> 44:16.700
Nie ... er.

44:18.400 --> 44:21.600
Lighter.
- No!

44:24.500 --> 44:26.700
What do they? What do they sell?
- Big ...

44:29.400 --> 44:32.300
Wo ... - Woman.
- A big woman? A big woman who works?

44:32.400 --> 44:35.700
Works in the store?
- No!

44:35.800 --> 44:38.400
What? Jamie, what?

44:39.100 --> 44:44.000
Cookie woman!
- Cookie wo ... woman.

44:44.600 --> 44:46.000
Cookie woman?

44:47.000 --> 44:48.000
Cookie woman.

44:48.100 --> 44:50.300
Dale's gas station. Fifth and maine.

45:16.300 --> 45:17.100
Tina Williams!

45:17.200 --> 45:19.800
If you are Tna Williams, stay where you are!

45:25.100 --> 45:26.300
Check the inside!

45:27.900 --> 45:31.500
<i>She appears unharmed.
- What the hell's going on!? I'm fine!</i>

45:31.700 --> 45:33.800
Please, you gotta come with us to the clinic.

45:34.900 --> 45:36.300
Is Jamie all right?

45:36.500 --> 45:37.600
Just get in the car.

45:42.600 --> 45:43.400
We're bringing her in.

45:45.000 --> 45:47.600
Unit 22. A-positive ...

45:48.300 --> 45:50.000
I don't believe this.
- Come on.

45:58.100 --> 45:59.100
Tina!

45:59.800 --> 46:02.200
Where's Jamie? Is something wrong?

46:05.800 --> 46:07.200
Tina!

46:19.700 --> 46:21.100
Say it again!

46:22.000 --> 46:23.900
T- T - Tina.

46:24.400 --> 46:26.100
I love it!

46:30.200 --> 46:32.300
Tina, don't go.
- I have to.

46:32.300 --> 46:34.400
Why?
- Because!

46:34.700 --> 46:36.500
You might not understand, but ...

46:37.700 --> 46:41.200
When you're older, there are people you're gonna meet
who make you feel ...

46:41.300 --> 46:42.800
like, connected.

46:42.900 --> 46:45.400
Like your heart is made of neon, and ...

46:46.200 --> 46:48.000
When you find them, you have to be with them.

46:48.700 --> 46:51.900
But he was with you.
- Who?

46:52.400 --> 46:56.000
The boogeyman.
- Oh, yeah. That's one way of describing him.

46:57.100 --> 46:58.800
Tina. No!

46:59.000 --> 47:02.800
Honey, I will come back later tonight
and I will sleep with you right here.

47:03.100 --> 47:04.800
Tina!

47:05.500 --> 47:07.400
I'll be back.
I love you.

47:08.600 --> 47:10.700
Tina!

47:13.900 --> 47:18.500
All right, buddy, let's hit the ... - All right you sto ...
- Why don't you stay the night?
- I'm sorry. I gotta run.

47:18.600 --> 47:24.300
Tina, please. - Stay away, okay? You know.
You're really creepy filling that little girl
with all that boogeyman crap.

47:24.400 --> 47:25.900
I believe that you're in danger.

47:26.000 --> 47:27.300
Jamie believes it too.

47:27.500 --> 47:30.600
Jamie's a nine-year-old girl.
- Be sensible!

47:32.100 --> 47:34.600
I'm never sensible if I can help it!

47:35.300 --> 47:35.800
Tina!

47:35.900 --> 47:37.200
I got these over here.

47:37.800 --> 47:39.500
For God's sakes, stop her!

47:42.000 --> 47:44.500
On whose orders?
- She hasn't done anything wrong.

47:46.100 --> 47:47.500
Follow her, then!

47:47.900 --> 47:49.400
At least you can do that!

47:49.900 --> 47:51.200
If that girl ...

47:51.300 --> 47:55.400
... dies tonight ...
- All right, all right. For you, doc, anything.

48:06.000 --> 48:08.400
You guys supposed to be trailing me or something?

48:09.700 --> 48:12.300
Well, then you can give me a ride to the Tower Farm.

48:39.300 --> 48:41.900
Tina.
Gotta help Tina!

48:49.600 --> 48:53.300
Jamie's not in her room! She's nowhere in sight!

48:54.900 --> 48:57.600
Hey!
- Loomis!

48:57.900 --> 49:00.300
What the hell are you doing?
- Jamie's gone.

49:10.600 --> 49:12.100
I'm gonna find Tina.

49:12.800 --> 49:15.500
You ... you don't even know where sh ... she is.

49:16.700 --> 49:17.800
But, I do.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.300
Where?

49:19.400 --> 49:21.300
The Tower Farm.

49:26.200 --> 49:28.300
Love your costume.
- Oh, baby!

49:35.000 --> 49:35.800
Tina?

49:36.100 --> 49:37.600
What?
- Where's Mike?

49:38.200 --> 49:40.200
Ask me if I care.

49:45.700 --> 49:46.600
What are you doing?

49:47.300 --> 49:49.300
What are you doing?
- Sitting here.

50:00.800 --> 50:01.800
What do you think?

50:02.500 --> 50:04.100
Well, orders are orders.

50:05.200 --> 50:07.400
That look like a life-threatening situation to you?

50:08.800 --> 50:09.500
Nah.

50:11.700 --> 50:12.600
Play crazy eights?

50:35.600 --> 50:36.900
Spitz and I just had ...

50:36.900 --> 50:39.300
... greatest night together.
- Yeah. What?

50:42.700 --> 50:43.400
Let's go.

50:52.100 --> 50:54.700
Oh, now wait. Hey, you cheated there.
- I did not cheat. - Come on

50:54.900 --> 50:56.400
I did not cheat.

51:06.300 --> 51:08.300
Take me, but spare my friend!

51:08.800 --> 51:10.100
She's a virgin.

51:10.900 --> 51:12.500
Got her phone number?

51:14.200 --> 51:15.500
Do you think that's funny?

51:16.000 --> 51:20.100
Hey, hey, no, man.
No. Hey, just a little Halloween prank, okay?

51:20.300 --> 51:22.800
Definitely not ... funny!

51:23.200 --> 51:25.300
Somebody could easily be dead right now!

51:25.900 --> 51:27.700
Fortunately, we're lousy cops.

51:28.200 --> 51:28.900
Sorry.

51:30.300 --> 51:31.400
Hey, guys!

51:32.700 --> 51:33.300
Hey.

51:33.700 --> 51:35.200
Look, what I found.

52:24.200 --> 52:27.000
Ohh! Kittens!

52:28.200 --> 52:29.400
Oh, look at 'em.

52:29.800 --> 52:33.300
Hello.
Hello babies.

52:33.500 --> 52:37.400
Hello.
Oh, they're so cute.

52:38.200 --> 52:41.600
Oh, I'm gonna get you.
- Get 'em, Tina! Get 'em!

52:42.700 --> 52:45.400
You, you, you, wait, wait, wait.
Thinking of getting kitten?

52:50.700 --> 52:52.600
Little, wee cat.

52:54.400 --> 52:55.200
Kitten?

52:59.500 --> 53:00.600
Psst! Kitten.

53:01.500 --> 53:04.000
I'm coming to get you!

53:15.100 --> 53:15.800
Kitten?

53:36.600 --> 53:37.500
Kitten ...

53:37.600 --> 53:40.300
I hear you, but I don't see you.

53:55.700 --> 53:57.800
Oh, my God.

54:09.700 --> 54:11.900
What am I doing?
I hate cats.

54:15.700 --> 54:16.800
Sam?

54:19.600 --> 54:20.700
Sammy?

54:23.400 --> 54:24.700
Spitz?

54:43.300 --> 54:45.100
I hate you!

54:45.600 --> 54:48.700
Sorry. - God!
- Did you see her face?

54:49.100 --> 54:50.700
You guys!

54:54.000 --> 54:57.600
Fine, I'll just let myself out. Bye.
- I'll be right back.

55:03.700 --> 55:05.400
Have fun.
- Okay.

55:20.800 --> 55:22.300
Spitz!

55:25.800 --> 55:28.600
What makes you think I'm gonna try and find you, huh?

55:36.600 --> 55:37.500
I got you!

55:48.800 --> 55:51.400
I saw you.

56:05.600 --> 56:07.800
Spitz, I'm out of here!

56:08.100 --> 56:09.300
Good night!

56:23.800 --> 56:24.900
Spitz.

56:27.200 --> 56:28.200
Spitz!

56:31.900 --> 56:33.200
Oh, my God!

56:36.900 --> 56:40.100
You son of a bitch!
You scared me half to death!

56:40.700 --> 56:42.300
It wasn't funny!

58:47.300 --> 58:48.600
Spitz, no.

58:49.300 --> 58:50.100
Spitz.
- Why?

58:50.200 --> 58:51.100
Why?
- No.

58:51.200 --> 58:53.400
What's the matter?
- Because I don't ... have anything.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:08.000
You son of a bitch!

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:15.800
That sounded different.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:19.800
Yeah, we never did stuff like that when we were kids.
- No, we were normal.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.300
Yeah, let's see what it is.

01:00:26.900 --> 01:00:27.900
Hey, fella!

01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:29.200
Over here!

01:00:31.900 --> 01:00:35.600
Hey, come on. Enough's enough, all right?
- Somebody can get hurt with that thing.

01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:37.800
Hey, somebody's gonna get hurt with that thing!

01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:42.700
Unbelievable! No respect for authority anymore.

01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:45.000
Well, it's the parents.
- Yeah. - Hey!

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:48.200
All right, punk.
I'm through fooling around.

01:00:52.600 --> 01:00:54.000
Hey, Sarah!

01:00:56.900 --> 01:01:01.900
So, you coming to the spring?
Oh, baby. You just wanna see me naked.
- I wouldn't mind.

01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:05.400
Come on. The hell with Mike. He ain't gonna show.

01:01:05.600 --> 01:01:08.000
I can't leave Sam and Spitz.

01:01:12.500 --> 01:01:13.400
Hurry, hurry!

01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:19.200
Hurry!

01:01:19.300 --> 01:01:20.300
Come on!

01:01:39.200 --> 01:01:40.200
Sam?

01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:43.600
You guys?

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.200
You guys, I don't hear any noise.

01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:53.400
Are you sure you're doing it right?

01:02:03.200 --> 01:02:05.300
You guys wanna come skinny-dipping?

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:12.300
Maybe you guys are already naked.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:20.100
Oh, God.

01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:24.100
Oh, my God.

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:37.200
Help me!

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:41.900
Help me, please! Somebody, help me! Please, help me!

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:44.200
No!

01:02:49.400 --> 01:02:50.800
Oh, God!

01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:53.300
Help me!
Please, help me!

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:55.900
Help me!

01:03:09.700 --> 01:03:11.000
Mike.

01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:13.800
Tina!

01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:26.600
Tina!

01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:37.700
Leave her alone!

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:39.300
Help!

01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:41.700
What do you want?!

01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:48.700
Leave her!

01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:53.000
No.
- Here.

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:54.900
Here!

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:01.800
Billy!

01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:05.700
No!

01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:10.700
Billy, no!

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:13.600
Please!

01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:15.000
Help!

01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:16.100
Please!

01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:21.600
Please!

01:04:23.300 --> 01:04:24.500
Help!

01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:27.600
Help!

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:33.700
No!

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:35.000
Please!

01:04:35.300 --> 01:04:37.500
Stay here, Billy. I'll be back.

01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:40.200
Leave her alone!

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:42.600
Oh, my God!

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.000
Jamie!

01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:53.100
Help me!
- Leave her alone!

01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:54.400
Stop!

01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:57.900
Stop! Jamie!

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:46.200
Tina!

01:05:47.300 --> 01:05:48.600
Baby.

01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:50.100
Tina!

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:51.900
Tina!

01:06:24.300 --> 01:06:25.500
No!

01:06:25.700 --> 01:06:27.000
Oh, God!

01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:29.000
No!

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:35.800
No!

01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:47.300
No!

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:49.800
Jamie!

01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:53.300
Run!

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.700
No!

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:04.000
No! No!

01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:08.700
Come on!
- No! Tina!

01:07:08.900 --> 01:07:12.100
No!
- Run!

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:13.900
Tina!

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:17.900
Tina!

01:07:18.100 --> 01:07:19.600
Come on.

01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:23.800
No...

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:26.100
Tina!

01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:28.500
Tina!

01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:31.600
Tina!

01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:43.500
Tin - Tina!

01:07:46.300 --> 01:07:48.600
All right, spread out and keep in contact!

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:52.300
Don't shoot!
- There's two of 'em right here!

01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:54.300
Loomis!
- Yeah, I've got them here.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:56.100
Come on. Get 'em out of here!

01:07:56.900 --> 01:07:59.500
Spread out. Find the other girl!
- Where's the other one?

01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:01.200
Come on, Loomis!
- Get these back here!

01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:03.900
Tina's still missing!
- The other girl's still missing!

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
All right, come on ...
- Watch yourself!

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:09.600
It's all right. You're gonna be all right.
- Jamie ...

01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:11.500
It's gonna be all right.
- Help Tina, please!

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:20.000
Tina!

01:08:20.800 --> 01:08:24.399
Tina! Tina!

01:08:30.300 --> 01:08:35.300
All right. Put three units over at the reservoir ...,
and let me know when ...
- Now are you willing to help me?

01:08:35.399 --> 01:08:36.899
<i>I wanna keep an eye on that ...</i>

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:38.700
Can you kill him?

01:08:40.500 --> 01:08:41.300
I think so.

01:08:41.399 --> 01:08:44.399
Now wait a minute, Loomis. There isn't a minute to wait.

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:49.300
What do you want me to do?

01:09:12.899 --> 01:09:13.800
Michael.

01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:18.200
It will destroy you too.

01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.100
One day,

01:09:21.899 --> 01:09:23.200
Michael ...

01:09:24.399 --> 01:09:26.700
this rage ...

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000
which drives you.

01:09:30.899 --> 01:09:34.100
You think if you kill them all, it will go away?

01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:37.000
It won't.

01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:40.500
You have to fight it ...

01:09:40.600 --> 01:09:43.300
in the place where it's strongest.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.300
Where it all began!

01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:54.300
-if you want to get rid of this ... rage.

01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:59.000
Michael, go home.

01:09:59.100 --> 01:10:00.900
Go home!

01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:04.400
Go to your house.

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:07.200
I shall be there waiting for you!

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:09.800
You'll find ...

01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:11.300
her ...

01:10:11.900 --> 01:10:13.700
waiting for you.

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:53.600
Can he see us from the street?

01:10:54.200 --> 01:10:55.700
Not a chance.

01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:03.900
Station one, are you sure he can't see you?

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.800
<i>Inside units, I want a report every five minutes.
- Roger.</i>

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:12.600
10 - 4.

01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:16.300
He may not be able to see you, Sheriff ...

01:11:17.200 --> 01:11:20.600
But we can all certainly hear you.

01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:23.500
All right, relax, Loomis. This is my operation.

01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:26.700
All right, fellas. Let's keep it down on the radio chatter.

01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:34.200
Looks like you and me are the only ones
around here keeping our cool.

01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:36.900
Good idea.

01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:39.400
You wanna practice our signals?

01:11:40.100 --> 01:11:41.000
All right.

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:51.100
You do that good and loud,
I'll be out here ...

01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:52.500
in a flash.

01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:59.100
You're one brave little girl.

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:13.400
Bi - Billy?

01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:17.400
Billy!

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:21.800
Billy!

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:26.400
Dr. Loomis!

01:12:28.600 --> 01:12:31.300
Bi - Billy.
- Dr. Loomis!

01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:33.000
Billy!

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.100
Meeker, he's at the clinic.

01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:37.700
Bi - Billy.

01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:40.700
This is car 16 calling the Masterson Clinic.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.300
Car 16 calling the Masterson Clinic.

01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:46.000
We just had a distress call from the clinic.

01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:47.500
They haven't been able to reach them again.

01:12:47.600 --> 01:12:49.200
There were four men up there.

01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:52.200
All right. This is Sheriff Meeker.

01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:54.100
All mobile units ...

01:12:54.200 --> 01:12:56.400
proceed immediately to the Masterson Clinic.

01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:57.500
Okay, let's go!

01:12:58.500 --> 01:12:59.900
Move out! Move out!

01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:06.000
Come on. Get going.

01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:08.200
Stop dragging your ass!
Move, move, move!

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:13.600
All right. You stay here.
Loomis, I'm moving the girl to the police station.
She'll be safer there.

01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:15.600
Understood.

01:13:15.800 --> 01:13:16.800
Move it out!

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.200
Let's go! - We're all clear.
- The girl, Charlie and Loomis are in this there.
- All right. I got it.

01:13:21.800 --> 01:13:22.800
Come on! Let's get out of here.

01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:52.000
Now you'll come.

01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:54.500
Won't you, Michael?

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.900
I'd say you've done your night's work.

01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:04.200
Come on. My pal Eddie and I'll
give you a ride to the station.

01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:06.000
Let's go.

01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:11.400
Dr. Loomis.

01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:19.300
What the hell are you doing?

01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:21.900
We aren't taking her ... anywhere.

01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:25.400
You've got five seconds to give me that key ...

01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:26.800
before I take it.

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.000
<i>Charlie.
Can you read me?</i>

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:32.300
This is Charlie. What's going on?

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:34.800
There's a car approaching.

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:36.000
<i>I'll check it out.</i>

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:42.600
Looks like one of ours.
It's a code two.

01:14:44.300 --> 01:14:45.600
Eddie, do you read me?

01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:53.100
Eddie, can you read me?

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:05.700
Eddie, come in!

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:10.500
Christ!

01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:12.500
I've got to call Meeker.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.300
You crazy son of a bitch!

01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:19.900
Charlie.

01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.500
Charlie ...

01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:25.600
Michael Myers ...

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:28.000
is outside.

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:31.800
Stay with the little girl.

01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:34.100
Please?

01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:48.000
This is all right.

01:15:49.400 --> 01:15:51.000
Don't worry about this.

01:16:14.100 --> 01:16:15.500
We have to get out of here.

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:34.400
You ...

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:37.500
You've come back to us, Michael?

01:17:01.100 --> 01:17:02.100
I ...

01:17:04.900 --> 01:17:07.100
I know why you've come back, Michael.

01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:10.900
Because the little girl ...

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:16.200
The little girl can stop the rage inside.

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:19.900
She knows how to do it, Michael.

01:17:20.100 --> 01:17:21.500
If you let her.

01:17:21.600 --> 01:17:23.000
She can s ...

01:17:23.300 --> 01:17:25.300
stop the rage ...

01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:28.200
The rage inside.

01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:31.600
Oh, she's not up there, Michael.

01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:35.700
She's down here in the middle of the old house where ...

01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:42.600
Your house ... Michael.

01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:45.200
Your house.

01:17:46.900 --> 01:17:48.400
Don't you remember ...

01:17:48.800 --> 01:17:50.500
how much better ...

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:52.400
you used to be?

01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:55.400
Let ... let me take you ...

01:17:56.300 --> 01:17:58.200
Let me take you to her.

01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:01.500
She'll take the rage away.

01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:02.600
Michael ...

01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:03.700
you'll be ...

01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:07.300
better ... then.

01:18:08.300 --> 01:18:09.800
You don't need the ...

01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:16.100
You don't need that.

01:18:28.300 --> 01:18:29.100
Hurry!

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:30.600
Please!

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:38.400
Hurry!

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:44.600
Please ...

01:18:59.300 --> 01:19:01.000
All right. Get on that side over there.

01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:02.100
Step over it.

01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:05.600
All right.

01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:08.100
I need you on my back.

01:19:08.500 --> 01:19:09.700
You just hold on.

01:19:15.400 --> 01:19:16.100
All right.

01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:36.400
All right.

01:19:38.300 --> 01:19:39.300
Come on.

01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:04.500
Come on, kids.

01:20:04.900 --> 01:20:05.900
No!, this side.

01:20:06.300 --> 01:20:07.500
Yes, sir.
- Inside. There!

01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:10.000
Hold it.

01:20:11.200 --> 01:20:13.200
Oh, God. Damn it!

01:20:13.800 --> 01:20:14.700
Move it. Quickly!

01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:17.700
All right. When everybody's out.
I want a sweep of the building and grounds.

01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:20.800
<i>Sheriff Meeker, do you copy?
- Yeah! - Third floor's secure. Willie's on the second</i>

01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:22.100
All right, keep it up.

01:21:20.900 --> 01:21:22.600
Please don't let him get me.

01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:24.000
Please, God.

01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:46.300
No ...

01:25:48.400 --> 01:25:49.600
Max!

01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:56.100
No!

01:25:56.700 --> 01:25:58.500
Rachel!

01:25:58.600 --> 01:26:00.100
No!

01:26:08.400 --> 01:26:09.200
Rachel?

01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:12.700
Help me. Help me.

01:26:48.900 --> 01:26:49.700
Uncle?

01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:53.700
Boogeyman?

01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:07.700
Let me see.

01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:33.800
You're just like me.

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:45.000
Let me.

01:28:06.000 --> 01:28:07.100
Oh, God!

01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:12.100
You want her?

01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:14.400
No!
- Here she is!

01:28:15.900 --> 01:28:17.500
She's yours!

01:28:18.100 --> 01:28:21.200
No!
- Your ... little girl! - No!

01:28:21.200 --> 01:28:22.600
Oh, no!

01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:27.200
No! No!
- Come and get her.

01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:28.800
Please!

01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:30.300
Come and ...
- No!

01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:35.800
No! Please!
- Come and get your little girl. - No!

01:28:36.600 --> 01:28:41.700
No!
- Come take us both. - No!

01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:43.600
No!

01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:44.700
Michael ...

01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:48.300
Let's play a game.
- No.

01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:51.600
Can you catch the little girl? Come catch.

01:28:51.600 --> 01:28:52.400
No!

01:28:52.500 --> 01:28:53.500
Michael.
- No.

01:28:55.300 --> 01:28:59.400
No!
- Get the little girl, then ... then you're home and safe.

01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:47.700
Die! Die!

01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:51.200
Die! Die, Michael!

01:29:53.300 --> 01:29:54.800
Die!

01:29:58.300 --> 01:30:00.600
Die! Die!

01:30:02.900 --> 01:30:03.600
D ...

01:30:46.100 --> 01:30:49.800
National Guard will take him
to a maximum security facility.

01:30:50.300 --> 01:30:52.600
Where he'll stay till the day he dies.

01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.500
He'll never die.

01:30:56.600 --> 01:30:58.300
All right. Take her back to the clinic.

01:30:59.000 --> 01:30:59.700
Come on.

01:31:11.300 --> 01:31:12.900
Ok, Tony I'll see you in the morning, huh?

01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:13.800
Good job.
- All right. Take care. Joe's back.

01:31:18.000 --> 01:31:18.700
Hey Joe!

01:31:20.500 --> 01:31:21.300
Yeah.

01:31:21.900 --> 01:31:24.300
Don't forget. You said you'd cover for me tomorrow.

01:31:24.600 --> 01:31:26.300
Yeah, I got it. Don't worry about it.

01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:27.600
Take it easy.

01:31:27.900 --> 01:31:30.200
Hey, you said you're gonna cover for me too!
- Get out of here.

01:31:58.000 --> 01:31:58.900
Spread out!

01:32:01.300 --> 01:32:02.300
Wait in the car.

01:33:42.500 --> 01:33:44.400
No.

01:33:45.700 --> 01:33:46.900
No!
