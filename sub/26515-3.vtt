You could spend time in juvie.

else they'd press charges,

You can't keep
running away like that.

I have to be the one

-So I can kill them.

is that it?

39:24.530 --> 39:27.000
No, they can't.

39:27.065 --> 39:29.702
They'll just make promises...

39:29.768 --> 39:33.806
but in the end they'll fail.

39:33.873 --> 39:37.742
They'll all leave.

Not really.

40:03.202 --> 40:06.206
I was just like you once.

I leaned on someone,

40:09.742 --> 40:11.610
if I trusted them,

40:11.677 --> 40:15.726
all the pain would go away.

40:17.016 --> 40:20.920
I was wrong.

40:20.987 --> 40:25.987
And anyone that tells you
any differently is lying.

40:26.326 --> 40:28.961
The loss is here
for good now.

40:29.027 --> 40:33.333
There's no getting over it.

40:33.400 --> 40:37.103
But you can control it.
You can channel it.

40:37.170 --> 40:40.472
No one else can do that for you.

40:40.539 --> 40:41.889
Just you.

42:43.963 --> 42:48.400
Seeing you back here.

42:48.467 --> 42:53.467
Truth is we should
never have let you go
in the first place.

But you're safe here.
