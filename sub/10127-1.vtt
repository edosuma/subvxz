OK, ONE PLACE
HAS A WHITE FRIDGE.
HE WANTS AVOCADO.

06:22.600 --> 06:25.934
THEN HE INSISTS
ON SOMETHING
WITH AN OCEAN VIEW

06:25.934 --> 06:27.834

THAT THIS ONE IS GONNA
BE ERIC'S ROOMMATE,

KNOW EACH OTHER?

08:06.500 --> 08:08.200

08:08.200 --> 08:09.734

KEPT JACK PRETTY BUSY,

'CAUSE WE HAVEN'T
HEARD FROM HIM.

08:22.200 --> 08:24.467
THAT'S NOT EXACTLY
THE WAY IT HAPPENED.

08:26.100 --> 08:29.667
LOOK, SHAWN, LOOK,
I THINK WE NEED
TO TALK, OK?

08:29.667 --> 08:32.500
YOU TURNED YOUR BACK
ON YOUR FATHER...

08:32.500 --> 08:34.500
AND ON ME!

08:34.500 --> 08:37.000
THERE...WE TALKED.

ARE YOU?

08:55.500 --> 08:59.200
FOR YEARS NOW, I HAVE WATCHED
YOU GIVE ADVICE TO EVERYBODY,

08:59.200 --> 09:01.600
BUT NEVER ME!
WHY IS THAT? WHY?

09:01.600 --> 09:03.600
YOU DON'T ASK.

09:04.700 --> 09:06.667
ERIC WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE IN COLLEGE,

09:06.667 --> 09:11.000
BUT AT THE FIRST
LITTLE BUMP IN THE ROAD,
HE COMES RUNNING BACK HOME,

09:11.000 --> 09:12.767
AND ALAN IS OK WITH IT.

09:12.767 --> 09:13.834
BUT YOU'RE NOT?

09:13.834 --> 09:16.400
IT WAS HARD ENOUGH
SAYING GOOD-BYE TO ERIC.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.100
I DON'T WANT

Jack: GOOD-BYE.

19:10.300 --> 19:12.100
Eric: BYE!

19:18.567 --> 19:20.367
HOW YOU HOLDING UP, CHET?

19:20.367 --> 19:22.967
I DID MY CRYING
IN THE TRUCK.

19:24.934 --> 19:26.100
AW, THIS FATHER THING--

19:26.100 --> 19:28.667
IT'S JUST NOT
AN EASY JOB, IS IT?

19:28.667 --> 19:29.767
NO.

19:29.767 --> 19:32.100
BUT I'M LEARNING.

19:34.200 --> 19:36.767
WELL, I DID IT.

19:36.767 --> 19:38.734
I GOT
MY OWN PLACE.

19:38.734 --> 19:40.367
YEAH.

19:40.367 --> 19:42.233
ME, TOO.

19:42.233 --> 19:44.100
LISTEN, COR,
UH...I'M SORRY.

19:44.100 --> 19:46.867
YOU KNOW, WITH
GETTING INTO COLLEGE
AND MOVING OUT,

19:46.867 --> 19:47.867
IT JUST--

19:47.867 --> 19:50.200
IT JUST SEEMED
EASIER TO STAY.

19:50.200 --> 19:51.500
YOU KNOW,

19:51.500 --> 19:55.500
I WASN'T TRYING TO...
KICK YOU OUT OF MY LIFE.

19:55.500 --> 19:57.834
I WAS TRYING TO KICK YOU
OUT OF MY ROOM.

19:57.834 --> 19:59.567
OH, THANKS.

20:00.600 --> 20:01.867
WELL, I GUESS
YOU GOTTA GET GOING.

20:01.867 --> 20:04.600
YOU WANNA GO
SET THAT ROOM UP
THE WAY YOU LIKE, HUH?

20:04.600 --> 20:07.133
YEAH. YEAH, LOTS
OF THINGS TO DO.

20:07.133 --> 20:10.100
LISTEN, COR, ACTUALLY,
UH, THE LANDLORD--

20:10.100 --> 20:12.967
HE MADE A MISTAKE.
HE MADE 2 SETS OF KEYS,

20:12.967 --> 20:15.233
SO...
DON'T BE A STRANGER.

20:25.967 --> 20:27.967
MR. FEENY'S SICK TODAY.
WE HAVE A SUBSTITUTE.

20:27.967 --> 20:29.600
OH, THAT'S GREAT.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.000
NO, THAT'S BAD.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.500
WHENEVER FEENY'S SICK,
HE HANDPICKS HIS SUBSTITUTES.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.467
THEY'RE ALWAYS OLD,
THEY'RE ALWAYS MEAN,

20:35.467 --> 20:37.567
AND THEY ALWAYS
MAKE US MISS FEENY.

20:38.734 --> 20:40.367
HELLO, CLASS.

20:40.367 --> 20:42.300
I'M MISS VALENTINE.

20:44.667 --> 20:45.734
IT'S HER!

20:45.734 --> 20:47.467
SHE WAS IN OUR FANTASY.

20:47.467 --> 20:48.667
WHAT FANTASY?

20:48.667 --> 20:50.133
NO FANTASY.

20:50.133 --> 20:53.667
MR. FEENY HAS GRADED YOUR
TEST FROM LAST FRIDAY.

20:55.367 --> 20:57.400
A B. NOT BAD.

20:57.400 --> 21:01.667
A D? ALL RIGHT,
LET ME TAKE CARE OF THIS.

21:01.667 --> 21:03.934
AFTER ALL, WE DO
HAVE SOME HISTORY.

21:03.934 --> 21:05.700
SHE WAS IN OUR FANTASY.

21:05.700 --> 21:07.400
SAY, "KISS".
KISS.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.600
[SLAP]

21:17.700 --> 21:19.567
APPARENTLY IT WASN'T HER.
