00:02.287 --> 00:06.246
<i># I'm not sick but I'm not well</i>

00:06.287 --> 00:09.279
<i># And I'm so hot</i>

00:09.327 --> 00:13.843
<i># Cos I'm in hell. #</i>

00:20.207 --> 00:22.038
<i>Yeah, I'm walking and reading,</i>
<i>sweetheart.</i>

00:22.087 --> 00:25.523
- <i>You got a problem with that?</i>
- (LAUGHING)

00:25.567 --> 00:29.242
<i>Urghl Great(l) Elena. If she sees me,</i>
<i>we'll have to do small talk.</i>

00:29.287 --> 00:31.403
<i>Could recycle my "nice weather" material</i>

00:31.447 --> 00:34.644
<i>from Mr Patel's,</i>
<i>but it doesn't really have a sign-off.</i>

00:34.687 --> 00:38.919
Can't wait to get my hands on you either,
you sexy little minx.

00:38.967 --> 00:41.845
<i>Urgh... nol I can't listen</i>
<i>to her sex chat with Jeremy.</i>

00:41.887 --> 00:44.117
- (RINGING)
- Jeremy!

00:44.167 --> 00:46.397
- <i>Oh, God.</i>
- I love you too, honey.

00:46.447 --> 00:47.436
Hi, Jeremy?

00:47.487 --> 00:51.196
Yes, I got Rizla papers. Normal.

00:51.247 --> 00:53.124
I refuse to buy "king skins".

00:53.167 --> 00:56.000
It's like asking to buy
a hypodermic needle.

00:56.047 --> 00:58.242
No, I did not get the "lube".

00:58.287 --> 00:59.640
See you in a minute.

00:59.687 --> 01:02.918
Uh, something's just come up.
Yeah, I'll see you at the airport.

01:02.967 --> 01:04.923
I should explain...

01:04.967 --> 01:07.356
Really, there's no need.

01:07.407 --> 01:09.443
<i>Please don't pull me</i>
<i>into your emotional fuck-piel</i>

01:09.487 --> 01:14.641
That was my long-term partner,
who's been away. So...

01:14.687 --> 01:16.598
I'm going to tell Jez!

01:16.647 --> 01:18.046
Right.

01:18.087 --> 01:19.839
Although maybe I shouldn't.

01:19.887 --> 01:23.516
Isn't there a saying, "Whatever
you don't know makes you stronger"?

01:23.567 --> 01:26.035
- No.
- You're probably right.

01:26.087 --> 01:28.203
Although... maybe you should tell him.

01:28.247 --> 01:30.442
It might be nicer coming from you.

01:30.487 --> 01:32.125
Nicer for who? For you?

01:32.167 --> 01:36.080
<i>Great. I'm the Man Who Knew Too Much.</i>
<i>Thanks, ears(l)</i>

01:37.487 --> 01:40.923
So, you'll buy tissue paper
for me to physically wipe my sphincter,

01:40.967 --> 01:42.480
but you won't buy a bit of lube

01:42.527 --> 01:44.518
to ease the giving and receiving
of pleasure?

01:44.567 --> 01:47.400
Uh-huh. That's right.
<i>Should I tell him?</i>

01:47.447 --> 01:49.438
<i>Really don't want to.</i>

01:49.487 --> 01:52.285
<i>Is that because I don't want to see</i>
<i>a friend hurt, or can't be arsed</i>

01:52.327 --> 01:53.396
<i>with the massive hassle?</i>

01:53.447 --> 01:56.120
So, Johnson's invited me round
to his new place.

01:56.167 --> 01:57.805
Not sure why. Could be anything.

01:57.847 --> 02:01.396
Business? Pleasure? He probably
just wants to shoot the shit.

02:01.447 --> 02:03.005
He won't want to shoot the shit.

02:03.047 --> 02:06.642
He's probably got loads of arsehole mates
that he goes white-water rafting

02:06.687 --> 02:09.076
and shooting the shit
and killing strippers with the whole time.

02:09.127 --> 02:11.118
What's... this?

02:11.167 --> 02:14.842
It's Elena's birthday present -
a bust of her head! It's not finished.

02:14.887 --> 02:19.324
- What? Do you think it's weird?
- No. A thousand times, no.

02:19.367 --> 02:21.198
I've got loads of other presents,
this is just the topper.

02:21.247 --> 02:26.605
So... everything going good,
with Elena, do you feel?

02:26.647 --> 02:28.285
Amazing!

02:28.327 --> 02:33.196
It's impossible to say just how great
she is just using stupid words.

02:33.247 --> 02:37.638
Maybe one day you'll fall in love
and then you'll understand.

02:37.687 --> 02:40.042
Uh-huh, maybe.
<i>Could wipe that patronising smile</i>

02:40.087 --> 02:42.317
<i>off his face with the truthl</i>

02:42.367 --> 02:45.837
<i>No. Be like picking off</i>
<i>innocent bystanders with a sniper rifle.</i>

02:45.887 --> 02:49.323
<i>Fun at first, but it would</i>
<i>quickly become a depressing chore.</i>

02:51.287 --> 02:54.404
<i>My God,</i>
<i>is this Johnson's recession residence?</i>

02:54.447 --> 02:57.200
<i>Not much to look at, but then</i>
<i>apparently Sugar actually operates</i>

02:57.247 --> 02:59.556
<i>out of a refurbed Autofix garage.</i>

03:00.327 --> 03:02.045
Mark! Hello.

03:02.087 --> 03:03.884
- Hi, Alan.
- Don't come in.

03:03.927 --> 03:05.406
Oh? No?

03:05.447 --> 03:07.085
- One question.
- Yes?

03:07.127 --> 03:09.004
Do you want to make
shedloads of freaking money?

03:09.047 --> 03:10.526
Um... yes.

03:10.567 --> 03:11.636
Then come in!

03:11.687 --> 03:14.326
<i>He's taken a shine to mel</i>
<i>He's singled me outl</i>

03:14.367 --> 03:17.245
Here's my pitch.
New management consultancy.

03:17.287 --> 03:18.845
You and me.

03:18.887 --> 03:22.084
I'm the face, you're the... tendons
and grisly shit under the surface.

03:22.127 --> 03:23.162
Whaddya say?

03:23.207 --> 03:24.720
Oh, my God.

03:24.767 --> 03:26.644
I don't know! Really?

03:26.687 --> 03:28.803
Look at you! You're like the fat girl

03:28.847 --> 03:30.917
who's just been asked
to the school disco!

03:30.967 --> 03:32.923
Well, yeah...
My only hesitation is

03:32.967 --> 03:36.960
that I don't have any actual experience
of management consulting...

03:37.007 --> 03:39.567
In. Fire 30% of the workforce.

03:39.607 --> 03:41.723
New logo. Boom! Out!

03:41.767 --> 03:44.042
You are now a fully trained
management consultant.

03:44.087 --> 03:45.759
(LAUGHS) Great!

03:45.807 --> 03:46.842
Follow me.

03:46.887 --> 03:49.037
<i>Finallyl I'm being groomedl</i>

03:49.087 --> 03:52.159
<i>Up the pink-carpeted stairway</i>
<i>to business abuse.</i>

03:52.207 --> 03:54.516
Welcome to the nerve centre.

03:54.567 --> 03:56.239
OK.

03:56.287 --> 03:58.642
Well, there's no point in maxing out
on overheads

03:58.687 --> 04:00.962
until the clients come flooding in, right?

04:01.007 --> 04:04.158
Right. Smart. Very smart.

04:04.207 --> 04:06.596
First things first -
let's hook up the printer.

04:06.647 --> 04:09.036
<i>Urgh. Alan's pyjamas.</i>

04:09.087 --> 04:11.555
<i>Probably still warm. Under the duvet.</i>

04:11.607 --> 04:14.883
<i>No-one should see under the duvet.</i>

04:14.927 --> 04:18.714
Good old Vista. People give it
a bad press, but I'm never upgrading!

04:18.767 --> 04:21.600
Why would I? It just feels
like a good pair of jeans.

04:21.647 --> 04:24.036
You fancy making us some builder's tea?

04:24.087 --> 04:27.477
<i>Wow. Amazingl</i>
<i>I'm working with Johnsonl</i> OK!

04:27.527 --> 04:29.438
<i>I've grasped</i>
<i>the talcum powder of powerl</i>

04:29.487 --> 04:32.559
<i>Could slip it into my pocket</i>
<i>as a memento.</i> Hi, Suze.

04:32.607 --> 04:34.120
Mark. Tea's there.

04:34.167 --> 04:36.761
Will you tell <i>him</i> his phone's charged?

04:36.807 --> 04:38.843
Er, right. Sure.

04:38.887 --> 04:40.559
Suze, where's the big scissors?

04:40.607 --> 04:42.120
Have you moved the big scissors?!

04:42.167 --> 04:44.920
Tell <i>him</i> they're in the clingfilm drawer.

04:44.967 --> 04:46.639
Right, I've got to go out - audition.

04:46.687 --> 04:48.439
Oh, brilliant, what is it?

04:48.487 --> 04:50.796
It's a stage version
of that movie <i>Crash.</i>

04:50.847 --> 04:53.441
You know, the one where
all the different races are all the same

04:53.487 --> 04:55.398
but they're all a bit different,
and it's all fine.

04:55.447 --> 04:57.438
The blackies and the whities, etc.

04:57.487 --> 04:59.125
That's an interesting message.

04:59.167 --> 05:02.284
It is, actually. I'm playing a whitie,
as you can imagine!

05:02.327 --> 05:04.921
- Right! Typecast again(!)
- Exactly!

05:04.967 --> 05:08.243
<i>Builder's tea.</i>
<i>I suppose that's middle-class slang.</i>

05:08.287 --> 05:10.755
<i>We don't coin much slang</i>
<i>in the middle classes.</i>

05:10.807 --> 05:14.766
<i>"Pants". "Mare". "Ooh, I'm having a mare,</i>
<i>this builder's tea came out pants. "</i>

05:14.807 --> 05:18.197
Right.
Suze says your phone's charged.

05:18.247 --> 05:19.362
Did you make the bed?

05:19.407 --> 05:21.363
- Er... no.
- You're not my wife, Mark.

05:21.407 --> 05:24.717
I had a wife. I don't need
another bullet in the head.

05:24.767 --> 05:26.166
OK, righty, righty.

05:26.207 --> 05:29.199
<i>I made his bed and got his tea.</i>
<i>I am his wife.</i>

05:29.247 --> 05:30.919
First things first - funding.

05:30.967 --> 05:34.084
I reckon we need
to each put in a two-er. Good?

05:34.127 --> 05:36.641
Oh, right? <i>2,000?</i>

05:36.687 --> 05:39.042
<i>Two million? £2?</i>

05:39.087 --> 05:42.159
Equal partners. 2K.
Straight down the middle.

05:42.207 --> 05:45.916
Lamps and JT. Working together in
perfect harmony. What do you reckon?

05:45.967 --> 05:51.405
I suppose... if I got an equity release
on the flat, then... Yes!

05:51.447 --> 05:53.438
Great. Gotta be cash, yeah?

05:53.487 --> 05:56.206
- Cash?
- When the banks collapse,

05:56.247 --> 05:58.761
the stud holding cash is gonna get a lot
of blow jobs, know what I mean?

05:58.807 --> 06:01.685
Er, OK... <i>fine. Oh, my Godl</i>

06:01.727 --> 06:04.036
<i>I'm bumping fistsl</i>
<i>I'm in bed with Johnsonl</i>

06:04.087 --> 06:05.156
Oh, for freak's sake!

06:05.207 --> 06:07.163
Are you going to need to print
anything today, Mark?

06:07.207 --> 06:09.437
Er, I don't know.

06:09.487 --> 06:11.045
No. I should be fine.

06:11.087 --> 06:12.440
That was the correct answer.

06:14.887 --> 06:16.843
Hello!

06:16.887 --> 06:19.685
Oh, hello. You OK here?

06:19.727 --> 06:22.241
Great. Join us.
Tell us about your day, dude.

06:22.287 --> 06:23.515
<i>Got to get out of the killing field.</i>

06:23.567 --> 06:25.205
Oh, fine. The meeting with Johnson

06:25.247 --> 06:26.839
was just about starting up
a management consultancy,

06:26.887 --> 06:29.606
so I'm definitely
going to do that. See you in a bit.

06:29.647 --> 06:33.276
Oh, my God! That's so exciting!
Tell us all about it!

06:33.327 --> 06:37.400
Yeah... I should probably
leave you two alone to talk about

06:37.447 --> 06:39.836
whatever important subject
you were talking about.

06:39.887 --> 06:43.038
Oh, we were just chatting about
having a mini-break in Crete.

06:43.087 --> 06:46.124
<i>Maybe. Maybe</i> having a mini-break.

06:46.167 --> 06:49.796
There's no war or bomb shit
in Crete, is there?

06:49.847 --> 06:50.996
No, I don't think so.

06:51.047 --> 06:53.481
Cool. I'll get some voddy.

06:53.527 --> 06:55.916
<i>He's excitedl He's checking out</i>
<i>the sumptuous menu options</i>

06:55.967 --> 07:00.085
<i>on the SS Titanic.</i>
So I take it you haven't told him?

07:00.127 --> 07:02.561
Well, I was going to. But then I was like,

07:02.607 --> 07:05.405
"Maybe wait until he's not holding
a big kitchen knife."

07:05.447 --> 07:08.041
- You have to tell him.
- Tell him what?

07:08.087 --> 07:10.840
- Nothing.
- What's up? What's going on?

07:10.887 --> 07:12.878
Oh, God.

07:12.927 --> 07:14.121
OK.

07:14.167 --> 07:16.635
Go on. Tell him, Mark.

07:16.687 --> 07:19.155
What? Why me? You tell him.

07:19.207 --> 07:21.675
- Well, I don't want to tell him.
- What?

07:21.727 --> 07:23.126
I'm not saying. I refuse.

07:23.167 --> 07:25.397
Well, I don't want to say. I can't.

07:25.447 --> 07:26.721
Look, what the hell is going on?

07:29.287 --> 07:32.279
Oh, for God's sake.

07:32.327 --> 07:37.481
Jez, Elena has a long-term, live-in lover.

07:37.527 --> 07:40.439
You're just a fuck-job on the side.

07:40.487 --> 07:42.079
What?! Elena?

07:42.127 --> 07:44.322
That was pretty brutal, Mark.

07:44.367 --> 07:46.278
I'm sorry, Jez.

07:46.327 --> 07:49.319
You're much more than a fuck-job.

07:49.367 --> 07:50.561
How long have you known?

07:50.607 --> 07:52.802
I heard them talking on the phone
a couple of days ago.

07:52.847 --> 07:55.805
You've known for two whole days?
That's sick.

07:55.847 --> 07:58.964
Look, I'm not the guilty person here,
Jeremy!

07:59.007 --> 08:00.918
You're shooting the messenger.

08:00.967 --> 08:02.605
Shoot each other!

08:02.647 --> 08:06.959
JEREMY: <i>What a bastard. Destroys my</i>
<i>perfect love just cos it's built on lies.</i>

08:07.007 --> 08:09.805
So this thing, is it serious?

08:09.847 --> 08:11.075
It's complicated.

08:11.127 --> 08:12.799
Oh, right.

08:12.847 --> 08:14.803
Is he dying?

08:14.847 --> 08:17.680
Is it a poet in a diving bell?

08:17.727 --> 08:21.276
Is it really sad and weird
but soon he'll be gone?

08:21.327 --> 08:23.921
No. We've been together
for a number of years

08:23.967 --> 08:26.561
and we are committed and in love.

08:26.607 --> 08:28.757
Oh, shit.

08:28.807 --> 08:30.399
I'm so sorry, Jez.

08:30.447 --> 08:34.486
I just thought you and me would be
one night of fun, and then I got

08:34.527 --> 08:40.238
sucked in, and we got serious,
and Gail was away travelling...

08:42.567 --> 08:46.526
Gail? As in... a woman?

08:46.567 --> 08:50.162
This love rival is a chick?

08:50.207 --> 08:51.720
Yeah.

08:51.767 --> 08:53.837
Are you disgusted?

08:53.887 --> 08:56.037
Is that a problem for you?

08:58.167 --> 09:00.761
MARK: <i>£2,000. Oh, God.</i>

09:00.807 --> 09:03.241
<i>The Halifax Top Savers Account</i>
<i>is finally dry.</i>

09:03.287 --> 09:05.118
<i>The last of the Corrigan millions.</i>

09:05.167 --> 09:07.283
Mark, you dick!

09:07.327 --> 09:08.840
You've got it all wrong, again!

09:08.887 --> 09:09.956
Hello? What?

09:10.007 --> 09:12.885
Everything's going to be fine!
The other guy is a woman!

09:12.927 --> 09:14.599
They're both two women!

09:14.647 --> 09:17.719
So it doesn't bother you, her being
in a relationship with someone else?

09:17.767 --> 09:23.399
Well, a bit, but basically, not really.

09:23.447 --> 09:26.086
I mean, me and this Gail,
we're just eating

09:26.127 --> 09:29.324
from different sides of the plate.
I play woodwind, she's on brass!

09:29.367 --> 09:32.564
Elena's betrayed you. How does it make
a difference that it's with a woman?

09:32.607 --> 09:34.325
Because it's hot!

09:34.367 --> 09:36.642
Even a dried-up, desiccated
old Bran Flake on toast like you

09:36.687 --> 09:38.245
should be able to see that.

09:38.287 --> 09:41.006
MARK: <i>If I'm a Bran Flake,</i>
<i>he's a slutty Sugar Puff.</i>

<i>Urgh. Can't really take more than</i>
<i>one lengthy toilet break per morning.</i>

09:47.087 --> 09:48.759
<i>The downtime here is nonexistent.</i>

09:48.807 --> 09:50.559
- Anything?
- I'm sorry?

09:50.607 --> 09:52.120
In the loo. How did it go?

09:52.167 --> 09:53.919
You want to know if I?

09:53.967 --> 09:57.437
Ideas, leads, pitches?
Did you not come up with anything?

09:57.487 --> 09:58.715
I was on the loo, Alan.

09:58.767 --> 10:01.679
Oh! Can you two keep it down a bit?

10:01.727 --> 10:04.480
Listen, I've ordered up
1,000 business cards.

10:04.527 --> 10:07.246
I hope you don't mind,
but I had to make a call on the name.

10:07.287 --> 10:09.755
Oh, fine. I liked them both.

10:09.807 --> 10:12.241
Which did you go for?
Consultio or Consultius?

10:12.287 --> 10:14.642
Consultio / Consultius.

10:14.687 --> 10:17.360
- How do you mean?
- Oh, for God's sake!

10:17.407 --> 10:20.922
<i>I wonder if Mrs Sugar's allowed</i>
<i>to sleep in the boardroom.</i>

10:20.967 --> 10:24.755
The name is Consultio / Consultius.
Got both bases covered.

10:24.807 --> 10:27.162
I've got our cover letter
ready to print up.

10:27.207 --> 10:32.804
Right, and as of now, Alan, how many
solid contracts or leads do we have?

10:32.847 --> 10:35.441
That's for me to know
and you to find out!

10:35.487 --> 10:37.000
Print, you damnable fudger!

10:37.047 --> 10:38.639
Maybe there's a connection problem.

10:38.687 --> 10:42.123
- Alan, the printer's not connected.
- No, it's wireless.

10:42.167 --> 10:44.522
<i>It's not wireless.</i>
<i>It doesn't say "wireless".</i>

10:44.567 --> 10:48.685
<i>It needs wires. Shall I say,</i>
<i>or live in his dream world?</i>

10:48.727 --> 10:52.003
Screw it. Sort it later.
Stick it on the laterbase.

10:52.047 --> 10:54.925
Good. I'm sure it'll work... <i>later...</i>

10:54.967 --> 10:56.082
(RINGING)

10:56.127 --> 10:57.116
Hello?

10:57.167 --> 10:58.441
Mark, tell him I'm going out.

10:58.487 --> 11:00.717
- Where?
- Anywhere. Milk.

11:00.767 --> 11:03.565
...Scotch Tape it, buddy.
Where'd Suze go?

11:03.607 --> 11:05.325
Er... to get milk.

11:05.367 --> 11:06.925
But we already have milk.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.401
I don't think it's really about the milk.

11:09.447 --> 11:13.759
Well, what is it about, Mark,
if you're the big expert?

11:13.807 --> 11:15.240
I know she's seeing someone.

11:15.287 --> 11:18.518
Is it that guy from the SMEG oven shop
or the monk she's e-mailing?

11:18.567 --> 11:19.841
I... don't know.

11:19.887 --> 11:21.878
Oh, you don't know?

11:21.927 --> 11:23.838
Then maybe you should keep
your trap shut.

11:23.887 --> 11:25.002
Did that occur to you?

11:26.567 --> 11:29.684
So when are your 2,000 notes
gonna make their appearance?

11:29.727 --> 11:33.163
Oh, yeah, right, soon.
<i>Don't tell him it's in my pocket.</i>

11:33.207 --> 11:35.516
<i>Tell him it's not in my pocket.</i>

11:35.567 --> 11:38.400
Although I was wondering whether,
in the current climate,

11:38.447 --> 11:41.359
it'll be possible to recoup
such a big investment in terms of...

11:41.407 --> 11:44.922
Relax, Mark. You've seen this
from the Sales Direct guys?

11:44.967 --> 11:48.039
They say they look forward
to hearing from us in the future.

11:48.087 --> 11:50.157
They "look forward to it".

11:50.207 --> 11:52.880
Now, what about that doesn't
spell to you serious interest?

11:52.927 --> 11:56.078
Right.
<i>Just keep nodding and smiling.</i>

11:56.127 --> 11:59.244
<i>Nodding and smiling</i>
<i>like Colonel Gaddafi's psychoanalyst.</i>

12:01.087 --> 12:02.884
It's great, isn't it, having an affair?

12:02.927 --> 12:04.485
It is exciting.

12:04.527 --> 12:07.678
Like this morning when you called,
and I thought, "Oh, hell!"

12:07.727 --> 12:12.437
But then I told Gail you were
someone else, and she bought it!

12:12.487 --> 12:14.000
It was totally mad.

12:14.047 --> 12:17.960
- (LAUGHS) Yeah. Mad, mad shit.
- (DOOR OPENS)

12:18.007 --> 12:19.679
Oh, bollocks... Gail! Just follow my lead.

<i>A sexy lesbo threesomel</i>

12:22.207 --> 12:23.799
Hi!

12:23.847 --> 12:26.645
I thought you were going from the
restaurant straight to your Mensa party.

12:26.687 --> 12:28.325
<i>Shirt too much?</i>

12:28.367 --> 12:31.086
<i>Shit, do I possibly look</i>
<i>a total dick here?</i>

12:31.127 --> 12:32.116
Who's, er?

12:32.167 --> 12:34.681
Oh, he's just getting some dope.
Jeremy, Gail.

12:34.727 --> 12:38.640
- Hi, how are you doing?
- Good. Just another local pothead.

12:38.687 --> 12:41.520
That's me! I live upstairs.
Buy the pot here, take it there.

12:41.567 --> 12:44.445
That's my system.
If you can call it a system.

12:44.487 --> 12:46.079
Cool.

12:47.167 --> 12:49.237
(WHISPERS) You should go.

12:49.287 --> 12:52.597
She'll sniff us out.
She's in Mensa, she is a genius.

12:52.647 --> 12:55.400
OK, well, see you around, neighbour!

12:55.447 --> 12:59.281
<i>Not so clever now I'm humping</i>
<i>your girlfriend, are you?</i>

12:59.327 --> 13:02.478
<i>You might be a big Mensan, but you</i>
<i>haven't figured that one out, eh?</i>

13:02.527 --> 13:04.483
Bye!

13:05.807 --> 13:09.038
<i>It's perfect. Happy birthday, Elena.</i>

13:10.167 --> 13:13.284
Where's real Elena? Aren't you
cooking her a birthday breakfast?

13:13.327 --> 13:15.079
She texted to say she couldn't make it.

13:15.127 --> 13:17.846
Gail took the morning off work
and surprised her.

13:17.887 --> 13:21.197
- Oh, right. How's the affair going?
- Good. Yeah, it's hot.

13:21.247 --> 13:23.477
We were going to watch
<i>The Wrestler</i> last night,

13:23.527 --> 13:27.122
but she'd already seen it with Gail,
so we watched <i>Grand Designs.</i>

13:27.167 --> 13:31.319
And then Gail came home and so
I had to leave. But yeah, pretty hot.

13:31.367 --> 13:33.085
Right. Great.

13:33.127 --> 13:35.766
Tell you what,
shall I make us both some pancakes?

13:35.807 --> 13:37.206
Actually, man, that would be really nice.

13:37.247 --> 13:38.362
(MOBILE BEEPING)

13:38.407 --> 13:40.204
Urgh. Big Suze.

13:40.247 --> 13:42.761
She keeps leaving
these endless messages

13:42.807 --> 13:44.240
about how pissed off
she is with Johnson

13:44.287 --> 13:45.766
and how he goes around
writing his name

13:45.807 --> 13:48.367
on all the fruit and if she accidentally
eats a Johnson orange,

13:48.407 --> 13:49.396
he totally loses it.

13:49.447 --> 13:52.439
- How's it going with Consultiarium?
- Brilliant.

13:52.487 --> 13:55.718
Yeah. Great. And one good thing is
I'm worrying

13:55.767 --> 13:58.725
quite a lot of the time whether
Johnson isn't totally losing his nut.

13:58.767 --> 13:59.756
Really?

13:59.807 --> 14:04.562
Yeah. I look at him sometimes now
and think, "Has Daddy's hat fallen off?"

14:04.607 --> 14:06.245
"Daddy's hat"?

14:06.287 --> 14:10.803
Yes, has Daddy's hat fallen off
and he's just standing there, naked?

14:10.847 --> 14:12.166
I don't know.

14:12.207 --> 14:13.765
- He'll probably be fine.
- (BEEPING)

14:13.807 --> 14:16.719
Er, Mark,
maybe scratch the pancakes.

14:16.767 --> 14:18.485
Gail's gone out to Pilates,
I've got a window.

14:18.527 --> 14:20.119
- You've been summoned.
- Exactly.

14:20.167 --> 14:21.725
Back to the coalface.

14:21.767 --> 14:25.123
Right, OK, keys, condoms, present.

14:25.167 --> 14:28.477
OK, off to my affair. See you later.

<i>It doesn't feel OK. He seems mental.</i>

And that's the front room, naturally.

14:39.447 --> 14:40.562
Jez, why are they?

14:40.607 --> 14:43.724
Relax. It's just a couple of neighbours
come down to have

14:43.767 --> 14:46.042
a chat about you getting
a job in a Mexican restaurant.

14:46.087 --> 14:48.203
What? No. No, Jeremy.

14:48.247 --> 14:51.478
Gail walked in out of the blue again.
And I thought,

14:51.527 --> 14:55.202
wouldn't it be great if you were
to track her movements for me?

14:55.247 --> 14:55.804
What?!

14:55.847 --> 14:58.202
So you're the guy who wants
to work in a Mexican restaurant?

14:58.247 --> 15:01.159
- Er...
- Yup. Yes, he is. Sign him up!

15:01.207 --> 15:05.246
Right, booze. Oh, I don't believe it,
I've forgotten to get booze!

15:05.287 --> 15:08.723
- I'm not a big drinker, anyway, so...
- Nonsense. I'll pop to the offy.

15:08.767 --> 15:12.965
And, Elena, you wanted me
to remind you about the thing.

15:13.007 --> 15:14.076
The thing?

15:14.127 --> 15:18.120
Oh, Elena! Remember?
You said, "My car's on pay and display,

15:18.167 --> 15:20.237
"please remind me!"
So I'm just reminding you.

15:20.287 --> 15:22.118
Oh, yeah, right.

15:22.167 --> 15:23.395
I'll walk you down!

15:23.447 --> 15:26.519
You two'll get along great.
Gail's a genius.

15:26.567 --> 15:31.721
I'm not a genius. I just have
a very high IQ. I'm a Mensan.

15:31.767 --> 15:35.919
It means she's very perceptive.
She spots things that other people miss.

15:35.967 --> 15:37.241
She's very highly attuned.

I'm not sure I need to sink
to washing up just yet!

It's £100 a shift with tips.
You could try a shift and see.

Oh? <i>Maybe I could juggle itl</i>

<i>Rich Mark could give to Poor Mark.</i>

<i>I could be the Zorro of myselfl</i>
That could be interesting.

16:02.967 --> 16:05.197

because I've got

16:05.247 --> 16:07.317

Will you tell E
I've grabbed an early one?

16:17.647 --> 16:20.002
Don't go. Stay.

- Why?

<i>Why. "Why?" she asks.</i>

16:24.167 --> 16:27.079
<i>Yes, why?</i> Because I've got
one or two questions.

For instance, delineate for me,
if you can,

16:31.927 --> 16:35.840
the main points of difference between
the burrito and the enchilada.

16:35.887 --> 16:38.560
There's a video, Mark. I'm going to go.

16:38.607 --> 16:40.916
No, I really,
really want you to stay.

16:40.967 --> 16:43.401
I'm in a relationship, Mark.

16:43.447 --> 16:45.244
Oh, no, God, I didn't mean...

16:45.287 --> 16:47.755
And it's a same-sex relationship.

16:47.807 --> 16:48.922
No, I'm sorry, I...

Of course I wasn't,

Everyone likes rum, don't they?

And I have to admit,
I had a little bit on the way back.

17:31.847 --> 17:35.362
You drank half a bottle of rum
on your way back from the shop?

- No, you definitely didn't mention

19:12.927 --> 19:15.316
that you'd started working
in a Mexican restaurant.

19:15.367 --> 19:19.679
It's just part-time.
I'm still your wing man, Alan.

19:19.727 --> 19:20.955
Great to meet you guys.

19:21.007 --> 19:23.805
What area are you interested in us
taking a look at for you fellas?

19:23.847 --> 19:25.565
Table four, Mark.

19:25.607 --> 19:27.404
- I ought to be going.
- Cool. Cool.

19:27.447 --> 19:29.403
I'm just settling these guys in.

19:29.447 --> 19:33.042
Can I get you hombres some nachos
or margaritas to kick off with?

19:33.087 --> 19:36.682
Well, we're grateful
you've done all this upfront.

19:36.727 --> 19:39.366
Don't thank me,
thank the Microsoft Office family.

19:39.407 --> 19:42.399
PowerPoint, Excel and Word -
the three amigos.

19:42.447 --> 19:44.722
So, what's your MO?

19:44.767 --> 19:46.758
- Well...
- Can we get some menus, please?

19:46.807 --> 19:49.162
Hold that thought, Colin,
hold that thought a second.

19:49.207 --> 19:51.402
<i>Just got to cold-shoulder</i>
<i>the shit-munchers</i>

19:51.447 --> 19:53.199
<i>before I service the big swinging dicks.</i>

19:53.247 --> 19:54.965
- Can we order some drinks?
- Nope.

19:55.007 --> 19:57.840
OK! Right, let's get into this mother.

19:57.887 --> 20:00.799
We're going to have
the early bird menu, please.

20:00.847 --> 20:02.280
No, you're not, it's 8.03.

20:02.327 --> 20:04.841
OK, Mark, look.
Working with Colin and Naz here,

20:04.887 --> 20:07.799
I think what we need
is two executive teams...

20:07.847 --> 20:09.644
Uh-huh. OK, smart, super smart.

20:09.687 --> 20:11.837
I'll do the consulting,
the number crunching,

20:11.887 --> 20:13.525
meta-analysis and business plan,

20:13.567 --> 20:17.162
while you cover the fucking off and
getting us an ice-cold pitcher of Bud.

20:17.207 --> 20:20.802
OK? See you around.
So, fellas, let's get into this now.

20:22.207 --> 20:24.437
<i>Heading for a bedding.</i>

20:24.487 --> 20:28.799
Oh, no. I thought tonight,
let's not do it on the bed.

20:28.847 --> 20:31.315
Let's do it on the floor.

20:31.367 --> 20:33.005
- Sexy.
- Yeah.

20:33.047 --> 20:35.766
Also I don't want the sheets
to smell of you.

20:35.807 --> 20:37.035
Uh-huh. Right.

20:37.087 --> 20:41.877
Well, I'm just afraid that Gail suspects
something. She's so clever.

20:41.927 --> 20:44.885
The other day she found that sock
and she was like, "What's this?"

20:44.927 --> 20:46.883
- What did you say?
- I said I didn't know.

20:46.927 --> 20:47.996
Nice.

20:49.127 --> 20:51.766
Elena, what would you do
if she did find out about me?

20:51.807 --> 20:53.843
Who would you choose?

20:53.887 --> 20:55.718
Obviously I'd choose you.

20:55.767 --> 20:56.677
(DOOR SLAMS)

20:56.727 --> 20:58.558
- Hey, honey!
- Shit!

20:58.607 --> 21:00.120
- I'm home!
- It's Gail.

21:00.167 --> 21:02.806
- You'd better hide!
- But you're choosing me?

21:02.847 --> 21:05.441
Sure, sure. Maybe later.

21:05.487 --> 21:09.275
<i>Great. Mr Chosen, on the balcony,</i>
<i>in his pants.</i>

21:09.327 --> 21:12.000
Look, I do have limits, you know?

21:12.047 --> 21:14.083
I have self-respect. I might jump!

21:14.127 --> 21:17.597
Come on, Jeremy,
we both know you're not going to jump.

21:19.287 --> 21:21.403
<i>Maybe I will jumpl That'd show herl</i>

21:21.447 --> 21:24.325
<i>Quite high.</i>
<i>Obviously I'm not going to jump.</i>

21:24.367 --> 21:26.597
MARK: <i>Yeah. Pretty good first shift.</i>

21:26.647 --> 21:29.957
<i>Sacked by Johnson from my dream job,</i>
<i>but on the plus side,</i>

21:30.007 --> 21:32.396

<i>What...? Is this some new... thing?</i>

21:37.567 --> 21:41.037
<i>Harassment by flailing washing?</i>

21:41.087 --> 21:42.600
<i>Am I being mocked?</i>

21:42.647 --> 21:45.207
<i>OK, face my persecutors.</i>

21:45.247 --> 21:46.919
- Jeremy?
- Mark!

21:46.967 --> 21:49.162
- <i>Bet he's naked.</i>
- Mark!

21:49.207 --> 21:52.722
<i>Of course.</i>
Jeremy, what was the... thing?

21:52.767 --> 21:55.600
It's some shirts with a tennis ball
tied in the end. Good, isn't it?

21:55.647 --> 21:56.557
Er...

21:56.607 --> 21:58.279
Look, I'm freezing.
Can you throw me a rope?

21:58.327 --> 22:00.477
- I haven't got a rope.
- You haven't got a rope?

22:00.527 --> 22:04.076
I don't own a rope.
I don't own a boat or any cattle

22:04.127 --> 22:06.925
or any of the things
that ropes are useful for.

22:06.967 --> 22:08.639
What the hell would you do
with a rope anyway?

22:08.687 --> 22:09.881
Climb up it.

22:09.927 --> 22:12.521
Oh, sure.
Climb up it using your "strength".

22:12.567 --> 22:14.842
- You could pull me up.
- Yeah, I could haul you up

22:14.887 --> 22:15.956
using my "muscles".

22:16.007 --> 22:18.840
- (DOORBELL RINGS)
- Shit, who's that?

22:20.127 --> 22:22.721
- Suze. What?
- Hi, Mark.

22:22.767 --> 22:25.679
Oh, God, I am in such a mess about Alan!

22:25.727 --> 22:28.321
I don't even know who I am any more.

22:28.367 --> 22:31.643
<i>I can give you a tip.</i>
<i>Two words</i> - <i>mental posho.</i>

22:31.687 --> 22:33.006
Is Jez in?

22:33.047 --> 22:34.958
Sort of... But not really.

22:35.007 --> 22:37.965
He's always been so sweet and
understanding about my problems.

22:38.007 --> 22:39.565
<i>You might find that's changed a bit</i>

22:39.607 --> 22:41.837
<i>since he stopped wanting</i>
<i>to have sex with you.</i>

22:41.887 --> 22:43.366
Where is he?

22:43.407 --> 22:46.717
OK, Jez, she's asleep.

22:46.767 --> 22:48.997
You can come through, but crawl.

22:49.047 --> 22:50.321
Crawl? Right.

22:50.367 --> 22:53.120
Then, if she does wake up,
I'll just say you're a pervert

22:53.167 --> 22:55.522
or a dope thief or a sex attacker.

22:55.567 --> 22:57.205
Right! Great.

22:57.247 --> 22:58.646
I'm golden.

22:58.687 --> 23:02.282
<i>This is good.</i>
<i>It's sexy, romantic, daring.</i>

<i>I'm like a modern-day Casanova.</i>
<i>Raffles, the gentleman perv.</i>

23:06.127 --> 23:07.401
<i>No clothes.</i>

23:07.447 --> 23:10.883
- Ssh!
- <i>Raffles doesn't deserve clothes.</i>

23:11.607 --> 23:15.156
Oh! He... He was down there.

23:15.207 --> 23:16.799
But he's gone.

23:16.847 --> 23:21.523
- (DOORBELL RINGS)
- All right, Jez, I'm coming!

23:23.247 --> 23:24.157
Alan?

23:24.207 --> 23:26.163
That was some dumb shit
you pulled tonight.

23:26.207 --> 23:28.004
Er, yeah, yeah, I know.

23:28.047 --> 23:30.641
But the good news is I nailed
the contract. Consultio is go.

23:30.687 --> 23:32.405
Wow, that's brilliant.

23:32.447 --> 23:35.484
Yeah, but here's the thing.
I've had a think. It's a biggie, Mark.

23:35.527 --> 23:37.757
But I need manpower.

23:37.807 --> 23:40.685
I need capital. I need you.
Are you still in?

23:40.727 --> 23:42.080
Of course I'm still in!

23:42.127 --> 23:45.483
But I can trust you? Will you put
your money where your mouth is?

23:45.527 --> 23:47.245
Of course you can trust me.

23:47.287 --> 23:51.519
All the crazy shit we've pulled
over the years - JLB, Kettering,

23:51.567 --> 23:56.925
the marketing/sales shitstorm -
we're always there for each other, right?

23:57.967 --> 24:00.527
Alan?! You followed me?

24:00.567 --> 24:01.636
Suze?

24:01.687 --> 24:03.757
Oh, I see.

24:03.807 --> 24:05.240
Jeremy.

24:05.287 --> 24:07.881
Got sick of the real world,
want the soft play area?

24:07.927 --> 24:09.440
Why didn't you tell me, Mark?

24:09.487 --> 24:12.047
- No, Alan, it's not...
- Some wing man you are.

24:12.087 --> 24:13.805
But, Alan... Don't go!

24:15.047 --> 24:16.526
Johnson?

24:18.567 --> 24:20.683
Alan, no! He doesn't deserve that!

24:23.647 --> 24:25.763
He got it for the wrong reasons,

24:25.807 --> 24:30.039
but overall, probably fair do's.

24:31.207 --> 24:32.526
