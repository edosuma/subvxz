00:18.680 --> 00:21.720
Hello! Thank you,
everybody, thank you,

00:21.720 --> 00:25.680
and welcome to what is
a Top Gear Special,

00:25.680 --> 00:30.200
a two-part adventure
around the heart of Africa.

00:30.200 --> 00:33.640
We were each told to buy
a second-hand estate car

00:33.640 --> 00:37.320
here in Britain for not more
than 1,500 quid.

00:37.320 --> 00:40.280
And then we were told to report,
with our cars,

00:40.280 --> 00:44.480
to the start line, which was
in a small village in rural Uganda.

00:44.480 --> 00:47.560
So, you've seen Sir David
Attenborough's take on Africa,

00:47.560 --> 00:49.720
now it's time to see ours.

01:03.400 --> 01:07.760
'I was the first to arrive
and I was feeling a bit nervous.'

01:09.480 --> 01:16.080
As you can see, I've gone for
a BMW 528i, and on the internet,

01:16.080 --> 01:19.000
it looked fantastic.

01:19.000 --> 01:22.320
But, I've now had the chance to
examine it more closely,

01:22.320 --> 01:26.200
and one or two things are giving me
cause for concern.

01:26.200 --> 01:29.040
For example,
it's got a manual gearbox.

01:29.040 --> 01:32.120
Now that tells me the previous owner
was the sort of chap that

01:32.120 --> 01:35.480
likes to take it to the max
between gear changes.

01:35.480 --> 01:38.080
Secondly,
the front tyres are Pirellis,

01:38.080 --> 01:41.960
the back tyres are made by a company
I've never heard of.

01:41.960 --> 01:46.160
So that tells me
it's been run on a tight budget.

01:46.160 --> 01:48.640
I don't know what the challenge
is going to be,

01:48.640 --> 01:52.000
but I'm going to be doing
it like that.

01:52.000 --> 01:56.440
Oh, hang on, that is the throb
of a turbocharged flat-4 engine.

01:56.440 --> 01:58.000
A sound which, all over the world,

01:58.000 --> 02:00.320
heralds the imminent arrival
of a moron.

02:02.120 --> 02:03.600
'And it did here, too.'

02:06.200 --> 02:08.160
It's Richard Hammond, everybody,

02:08.160 --> 02:11.200
who I suspect has started
to dye his hair.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.120
See what you think.

02:14.120 --> 02:15.400
Hammond!

02:15.400 --> 02:16.840
And there it is.

02:16.840 --> 02:18.040
It is, yes.

02:18.040 --> 02:22.120
Well, there can be only one word.
Legend. Subaru Impreza WRX estate.

02:22.120 --> 02:26.040
And driven by emeritus professors
all over the world.

02:26.040 --> 02:28.360
Yes, yes. No, no.
Just hang on. Here's my thinking.

02:28.360 --> 02:32.360
I don't know what challenges face us
here, but think about it.

02:32.360 --> 02:35.080
Subaru stands for
Toughest-Thing-On-The-Planet,

02:35.080 --> 02:38.280
WRX stands for world rallycross,
which the Impreza just owned.

02:38.280 --> 02:41.760
It's all there. Four-wheel-drive,
turbocharged estate.

02:41.760 --> 02:44.480
But you're going to look
stupid doing it.

02:44.480 --> 02:45.600
I don't have to look.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.920
I know I'm wearing double denim,
and that is a mistake,

02:47.920 --> 02:52.240
but you've got Daktari trousers on,
and the wheels of the agri-yob.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.280
Actually, it looks a bit like you.

02:54.280 --> 02:55.320
What?

02:55.320 --> 02:58.720
You know, small, and with
a sort of surprised expression.

02:58.720 --> 02:59.800
"A tree!" Yes.

02:59.800 --> 03:00.880
"A house!"

03:00.880 --> 03:03.920
Well, then, that's perfect.
My face in that car.

03:03.920 --> 03:06.800
Honestly, I'm so chuffed.
This time, I've done this right.

03:06.800 --> 03:08.640
Big boot. Practical.

03:08.640 --> 03:09.840
Practical?

03:09.840 --> 03:11.360
So, what have you got?

03:11.360 --> 03:12.560
Oh!

03:12.560 --> 03:15.080
528i, rear wheel drive,
2.8 straight-6.

03:15.080 --> 03:16.320
How many miles has it done?

03:16.320 --> 03:21.520
151,000. This, though, is the last
of the mechanical 5-series.

03:21.520 --> 03:23.760
After this,
they started using computers.

03:23.760 --> 03:25.400
What, their solid state?

03:25.400 --> 03:29.080
This is simple, mechanical
engineering. Anywhere, listen.

03:29.080 --> 03:30.200
Yes?

03:30.200 --> 03:31.480
James isn't here. No.

03:31.480 --> 03:33.040
No surprises there.

03:33.040 --> 03:35.440
I know for a fact what he's got.

03:35.440 --> 03:36.480
Go on.

03:36.480 --> 03:37.520
He'll have a Volvo.

03:37.520 --> 03:38.760
Yeah.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.120
He'll have gone...
Yes, yes, yes.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.280
Because you know he's got
no imagination at all.

03:44.560 --> 03:48.160
'As it turned out,
James did have a Volvo,

03:48.160 --> 03:50.800
'but not the sort of Volvo
we were expecting.'

03:51.800 --> 03:53.040
That isn't an 850 R, is it?

03:53.040 --> 03:54.080
It is, it is!

03:55.240 --> 03:56.400
That's a bold call!

03:56.400 --> 03:57.760
Gentlemen. Yes?

03:57.760 --> 03:59.720
You bought an 850 R?

03:59.720 --> 04:01.880
It doesn't matter, it's a Volvo.

04:01.880 --> 04:05.520
This defines the estate car. Nothing
else is an estate car, only this.

04:05.520 --> 04:07.160
Have you seen the tyres on an 850 R?

04:07.160 --> 04:08.240
Well, there aren't any.

04:08.240 --> 04:09.560
It has tyres.

04:09.560 --> 04:12.680
It's just a thin veneer of paint
on a wheel.

04:12.680 --> 04:16.200
But they're high-performance tyres.
It's a high-performance car.

04:16.200 --> 04:17.959
I know. It does 146mph.

04:17.959 --> 04:20.240
Do you remember
British Touring Car Championships?

04:20.240 --> 04:21.560
These were great fun to watch.

04:21.560 --> 04:23.880
Yes. And they were on dirt tracks,
weren't they? No.

04:23.880 --> 04:24.920
Racetracks. Yes.

04:24.920 --> 04:27.360
Do you think when Volvo sat down to
the design the 850 R,

04:27.360 --> 04:29.000
they said, "Now, Africa."

04:29.000 --> 04:31.320
"We need to try
and get some market share over there,

04:31.320 --> 04:35.680
"so let's lower the suspension,
fit very low profile tyres."

04:35.680 --> 04:37.920
They didn't think that in
so many words,

04:37.920 --> 04:41.080
but when you design a Volvo,
you design it for everything.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.200
It doesn't look at home, does it?

04:43.200 --> 04:44.800
That looks at home.

04:44.800 --> 04:47.520
That looks at home on the M4
in the outside lane,

04:47.520 --> 04:48.960
too close to the car in front,

04:48.960 --> 04:52.960
being driven by an embittered
toner distribution manager.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.040
He's right.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.480
Let's be honest.

04:55.480 --> 04:57.040
That's going to beach.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.360
It's not. It is!

04:59.360 --> 05:02.160
'As we argued, a challenge arrived.'

05:02.160 --> 05:04.240
Oh, hello.

05:04.240 --> 05:05.360
Thank you.

05:06.480 --> 05:07.880
Oh!

05:07.880 --> 05:11.440
"You will find
the source of the River Nile."

05:13.360 --> 05:15.760
That's it? That's it.

05:15.760 --> 05:18.400
Oh, so we're Livingstone, Burton
and Speke!

05:18.400 --> 05:19.520
Yes, we are.

05:19.520 --> 05:21.720
And I have the right car!

05:21.720 --> 05:25.960
Oh, come on, for exploring.
If Livingstone was still alive...

05:25.960 --> 05:27.240
He's not, is he?

05:27.240 --> 05:30.280
No. Ken Livingstone is,
but it's not Ken Livingstone.

05:30.280 --> 05:32.600
If the other, explorer Livingstone
bloke were alive,

05:32.600 --> 05:35.480
he would drive
a Subaru Impreza WRX estate.

05:35.480 --> 05:39.920
Yeah, but Speke, my favourite of all
the Victorian explorers, Beemer man.

05:39.920 --> 05:41.080
Was he? Yeah.

05:41.080 --> 05:42.760
So do we just go that way?

05:43.840 --> 05:46.480
Well, do you know,
I'd head downhill, personally.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.880
Oh, no, no, uphill!

05:49.880 --> 05:50.960
Right, uphill.

05:50.960 --> 05:53.360
Looking for the source of a river,
uphill.

05:55.120 --> 05:56.160
Here we go.

05:59.840 --> 06:01.120
The source of the...

06:01.120 --> 06:02.600
RUMBLING

06:02.600 --> 06:04.840
The source of the River Nile.

06:09.280 --> 06:13.440
The Nile,
the longest river in the world.

06:13.440 --> 06:17.760
A mighty 4,000-mile ribbon
of year-round water,

06:17.760 --> 06:21.720
running from the heart of Africa
to the Mediterranean Sea,

06:21.720 --> 06:25.760
bringing life and sustenance
to millions.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.320
Finding its source
has occupied the minds

06:28.320 --> 06:32.920
and claimed the lives of explorers
for thousands of years.

06:32.920 --> 06:37.800
Roman legions, Arab traders,
the Victorian British.

06:37.800 --> 06:42.640
All have forged a path through
the fast heat of this awe-inspiring

06:42.640 --> 06:47.480
continent to find where the raging
torrent came from.

06:50.040 --> 06:53.920
And today, we would join that
illustrious band of brothers.

06:53.920 --> 06:57.480
We would take up the challenge
no matter what the perils,

06:57.480 --> 07:00.240
no matter what the hardships,
no matter what...

07:01.240 --> 07:08.320
I'm sorry to interrupt myself,
but I think we have a problem.

07:08.320 --> 07:10.120
Erm...

07:10.120 --> 07:11.640
We've found it.

07:13.680 --> 07:14.800
Right.

07:18.280 --> 07:20.240
Erm...

07:20.240 --> 07:21.560
Erm...

07:21.560 --> 07:23.200
That is Lake Victoria.

07:23.200 --> 07:24.280
It is.

07:24.280 --> 07:27.840
Man has known for 160 years
that Lake Victoria

07:27.840 --> 07:31.640
is the source of the Nile,
and it's not like we could miss it.

07:31.640 --> 07:32.760
It's quite large.

07:32.760 --> 07:33.920
It is the size of Latvia.

07:33.920 --> 07:34.960
Is it? Yeah.

07:34.960 --> 07:37.200
This exploring is not as hard as
I thought it would be.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.680
No, my car hasn't suffered at all.

07:38.680 --> 07:40.400
No, I'm fine.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.800
What are we going to
do for the rest of...?

07:42.800 --> 07:44.440
We're only a few minutes in.

07:44.440 --> 07:47.680
We could pretend we haven't.
If we stand like this...

07:47.680 --> 07:48.960
No, because you can hear it.

07:48.960 --> 07:50.320
You can't miss it.

07:50.320 --> 07:51.440
What?

07:51.440 --> 07:53.720
Look, we've already found it,
you idiot.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.440
That is the source of the Nile.

07:55.440 --> 07:57.880
"This is not
the source of the Nile."

07:57.880 --> 07:59.200
It is.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.800
"The source of the Nile
is still disputed.

08:01.800 --> 08:05.040
"The Victorians thought
it was Lake Victoria,

08:05.040 --> 08:08.680
"but today we know this huge body
of water is fed by many rivers.

08:08.680 --> 08:12.520
"One of them is the true source,
and even today, in 2012,

08:12.520 --> 08:16.000
"experts have not been able
to determine which it is.

08:16.000 --> 08:17.040
"You will."

08:23.240 --> 08:24.840
You know what?

08:24.840 --> 08:27.120
This is an opportunity for us

08:27.120 --> 08:29.440
to write ourselves
into the history books.

08:29.440 --> 08:32.720
I mean, finding the source of the
Nile, if we can say this is it...

08:34.400 --> 08:36.120
And then it would be marked
on a map,

08:36.120 --> 08:38.240
and we'd be able to go,
"That was us."

08:38.240 --> 08:39.520
This is quite a big one.

08:39.520 --> 08:41.720
That's quite good, actually.
I quite like that.

08:41.720 --> 08:43.760
What?

08:43.760 --> 08:47.920
It says experts have not been able
to determine which it is.

08:47.920 --> 08:49.000
Yeah.

08:49.000 --> 08:50.400
Well, where do we fit in?

08:51.400 --> 08:54.480
'We broke out the map, and
discovered that two places

08:54.480 --> 08:57.840
'are currently marked
as the source of the Nile.

08:57.840 --> 09:01.120
'One in Burundi, found by
a Dr Burckhard Waldecker,

09:01.120 --> 09:04.880
'and one in Rwanda,
found by Joanna Lumley.

09:06.720 --> 09:09.560
'And since our source had to be
further from the Mediterranean

09:09.560 --> 09:13.080
'than either of these two,
it had to be further south.'

09:15.800 --> 09:19.880
Hang on, hang on.
Here's the Nile, OK, but look.

09:19.880 --> 09:26.080
The Nile also comes here,
into this lake, and then this lake,

09:26.080 --> 09:28.120
which is connected to that lake.

09:28.120 --> 09:31.160
It doesn't say on the map,
but if these two are connected, look,

09:31.160 --> 09:33.400
this will be the source of the Nile,
down here.

09:33.400 --> 09:35.360
Yeah,
but if those two are connected,

09:35.360 --> 09:38.120
I think we'd know about it by now,
and they would have drawn it on.

09:38.120 --> 09:39.600
No, no, you say that,

09:39.600 --> 09:42.600
but David Livingstone thought
the source of the Nile was down here.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.080
So what we need to do is go here

09:44.080 --> 09:47.040
and establish that these
two are joined up,

09:47.040 --> 09:49.080
check it out, we're in business.

09:50.440 --> 09:53.240
And so our epic journey began.

09:56.840 --> 10:00.480
A journey that would see us taking
on nature at its most brutal.

10:02.240 --> 10:05.600
There would be lions, insects
and thick, glutinous mud.

10:07.720 --> 10:11.000
We'd have to climb every mountain
and ford every stream.

10:12.280 --> 10:16.040
And we'd have to do it all in three
second-hand cars we'd bought

10:16.040 --> 10:18.640
for less than 1,500 quid each.

10:30.480 --> 10:32.040
Right, my car.

10:32.040 --> 10:34.640
Well, it's got quite a sticky
throttle, but other than that,

10:34.640 --> 10:38.360
every single thing works,
even the air conditioning.

10:38.360 --> 10:41.320
I've never, ever had a car with
working air conditioning

10:41.320 --> 10:44.760
before on one of these trips,
but I have now, and it is joyous.

10:48.800 --> 10:52.600
The Impreza is all about that engine
and drivetrain.

10:52.600 --> 10:56.560
You're just aware,
constantly, that this is rally-bred.

10:56.560 --> 10:59.520
The other two, they're just sporty
versions of ordinary estate cars.

11:00.680 --> 11:02.480
This is the best car here, fact.

11:06.760 --> 11:09.560
It's a cracking car,
the Volvo 850 R.

11:09.560 --> 11:12.040
This one's done 145,000 miles.

11:12.040 --> 11:14.680
It's just clicked over, in fact,
onto that figure,

11:14.680 --> 11:16.320
and you wouldn't really know.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.480
It's so smooth,
the transmission is excellent,

11:18.480 --> 11:21.080
the engine is silky,
everything works.

11:21.080 --> 11:24.680
Except the air conditioning.

11:24.680 --> 11:25.800
But at least that saves me

11:25.800 --> 11:28.880
the effort of getting really annoyed
when the other two deliberately

11:28.880 --> 11:33.280
break it out of spite,
jealousy and small-mindedness.

11:33.280 --> 11:34.840
SIREN BLARES

11:34.840 --> 11:37.240
Crikey! It's the Ugandan rozzers.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.720
I think the President's
just driven past us.

11:53.120 --> 11:56.560
A couple of rules you need to know,
really, about Uganda,

11:56.560 --> 11:58.000
if you're coming here.

11:58.000 --> 12:02.000
Number one, if you're a male
homosexual and you indulge in

12:02.000 --> 12:05.320
your homosexuality,
it's life imprisonment.

12:05.320 --> 12:06.680
That's very important to know.

12:08.600 --> 12:13.480
Also, it is compulsory here for
motorcyclists to wear crash helmets,

12:13.480 --> 12:17.720
unless you are a woman on her way
back from the hairdressers.

12:17.720 --> 12:20.920
Then you are allowed to wear
a carrier bag on your head instead.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.680
I promise that's true!

12:29.960 --> 12:32.680
At this point, the producers
told us to stop off

12:32.680 --> 12:35.920
at the still bullet-scarred
Entebbe Airport.

12:39.960 --> 12:45.160
It was here, in 1976, that Israeli
special forces staged a daring

12:45.160 --> 12:49.000
operation to rescue passengers
from a hijacked airliner.

12:50.480 --> 12:51.720
Oh, wow, look at this!

13:03.640 --> 13:06.680
I'll tell you what, I couldn't be
Israeli special forces.

13:06.680 --> 13:07.720
You'd get out of breath.

13:07.720 --> 13:08.760
I'm exhausted.

13:08.760 --> 13:13.400
They'd be sitting there thinking,
"Help, here comes help," and then...

13:13.400 --> 13:15.440
IMITATES WHEEZING

13:15.440 --> 13:17.560
"Sorry, just give us five!"

13:17.560 --> 13:19.080
More bullet holes.

13:19.080 --> 13:22.320
'Out on the balcony,
we saw something a bit worrying.'

13:23.560 --> 13:25.360
Is that a Ford Scorpio?

13:25.360 --> 13:26.520
Where? There.

13:26.520 --> 13:28.040
It is.

13:28.040 --> 13:29.360
Estate.

13:29.360 --> 13:32.200
I'd say that's there for one reason!

13:32.200 --> 13:34.760
That's why they brought us here.
Funny.

13:34.760 --> 13:36.960
Funny. Because what that is...

13:36.960 --> 13:41.080
That's the forfeit car. It is.
If one of our cars goes wrong...

13:41.080 --> 13:44.280
Which, let's face it, James,
yours is going to break in half.

13:44.280 --> 13:46.480
I've always liked the Scorpio!

13:46.480 --> 13:47.560
You have not!

13:47.560 --> 13:49.720
You know that word you like,
James, gopping?

13:49.720 --> 13:50.880
It is gopping!

13:50.880 --> 13:54.080
That was invented. Nothing has ever
been more gopping than that!

13:55.760 --> 13:57.600
'And as we prepared to leave,

13:57.600 --> 14:01.280
'it looked like one of us
would soon be driving it.'

14:01.280 --> 14:02.760
ENGINE REVS

14:02.760 --> 14:04.080
That's full throttle.

14:06.400 --> 14:10.680
It's revving, slightly,
but I'm not doing it.

14:11.840 --> 14:14.960
You know this all-mechanical BMW of
yours? You were very proud of that.

14:14.960 --> 14:16.280
Yeah.

14:16.280 --> 14:17.880
Does it have a fly-by-wire throttle?

14:17.880 --> 14:18.960
Yeah. Ha-ha-ha!

14:18.960 --> 14:21.800
So it's all mechanical,
except that bit?

14:21.800 --> 14:25.080
'Jeremy broke out his vast
and sophisticated toolkit.'

14:31.760 --> 14:33.240
What else is electrical in here?

14:33.240 --> 14:35.000
BOTH: Not the exhaust manifold.

14:36.240 --> 14:38.800
I've done the fuse box,
if that's what that is.

14:38.800 --> 14:41.120
That's an air filter.

14:41.120 --> 14:42.160
Right.

14:43.240 --> 14:45.560
"It's all mechanical,
you can mend it with a hammer!"

14:45.560 --> 14:47.160
If this works... Yes?

14:48.600 --> 14:50.200
ENGINE REVS CONSISTENTLY

14:50.200 --> 14:51.280
Ha-ha-ha!

14:51.280 --> 14:52.320
Soldier on.

14:57.400 --> 15:00.160
With my throttle still not
working brilliantly,

15:00.160 --> 15:02.240
we set off for the lakes.

15:02.240 --> 15:06.080
But first, we had to get through
Uganda's capital city.

15:06.080 --> 15:07.280
Kampala.

15:16.960 --> 15:19.680
This is going to turn out to be
one of those places

15:19.680 --> 15:21.720
with terrible crash statistics.

15:23.760 --> 15:26.080
In fact, Hammond was wrong.

15:26.080 --> 15:29.440
Because to have a crash,
first you have to be moving.

15:34.040 --> 15:35.080
Holy cow!

15:37.760 --> 15:38.800
That is...

15:40.000 --> 15:42.480
We're never, ever, ever
going to get through.

15:47.320 --> 15:50.280
What are we going to do,
seriously, here?

15:50.280 --> 15:53.200
We're never,
ever going to get through there.

15:53.200 --> 15:56.280
'It's probably safe to say
the Victorian explorers

15:56.280 --> 15:58.640
'didn't face problems
as big as this.'

16:00.320 --> 16:02.280
Oh, Jesus!

16:05.360 --> 16:07.800
Sally Traffic, are you watching
this on Radio 2?

16:07.800 --> 16:09.680
Because this is what
we call a traffic jam.

16:09.680 --> 16:13.840
From now on, just go, "Everything's
going very well in England, really."

16:15.840 --> 16:17.000
Oh, my God.

16:18.240 --> 16:20.640
Hammond, this is phenomenal.

16:20.640 --> 16:23.800
It is the heaviest traffic ever,
ever seen.

16:26.720 --> 16:30.040
This is just like a scrapyard
on the road in front.

16:30.040 --> 16:32.160
Cars and vans
piled on top of each other.

16:37.360 --> 16:38.680
Going to finish our days here.

16:41.800 --> 16:44.600
Well, we're all right
if we want supper.

16:44.600 --> 16:46.480
I fancy a banana.

16:46.480 --> 16:47.600
Excuse me?

16:50.320 --> 16:55.000
'Not knowing the exchange rate,
I accidentally bought more than one.'

16:55.000 --> 16:56.760
No, it's all right.
Do I have all of them?

16:58.160 --> 17:00.160
Oh, Christ! Oh, bloody hell!

17:00.160 --> 17:01.200
How do you do that?

17:03.760 --> 17:05.680
How the hell do you do that?

17:05.680 --> 17:07.040
I can't!

17:13.240 --> 17:16.880
Three hours later, our average speed
made for grim reading.

17:23.720 --> 17:25.240
It must quieten down soon.

17:28.400 --> 17:29.440
It's evening now.

17:31.720 --> 17:32.760
'But it didn't.'

18:00.640 --> 18:01.680
It wasn't a dream.

18:03.280 --> 18:04.320
I'm still here.

18:08.880 --> 18:11.160
I can't get over how heavy those
bananas were.

18:12.640 --> 18:14.200
How could she have them on her head?

18:17.000 --> 18:20.120
'By this stage,
we were pretty famished,

18:20.120 --> 18:22.320
'but then breakfast turned up.'

18:23.520 --> 18:27.080
Wow, that's just a meat
feast in front of me here!

18:28.080 --> 18:29.680
Hang on, look, look. Right.

18:29.680 --> 18:32.160
Well, you were here first,
so do I buy yours?

18:33.640 --> 18:34.800
More bones.

18:34.800 --> 18:36.800
Bone.

18:36.800 --> 18:38.400
What, it's goat bone?
Yeah.

18:38.400 --> 18:40.160
I don't want that.

18:41.800 --> 18:43.000
How much is the water?

18:43.000 --> 18:44.680
Yes. How much is that?

18:45.760 --> 18:47.320
This one. It just happens
to be that.

18:47.320 --> 18:50.400
Obviously, it is. Of course it is.
Thank you very much.

18:51.680 --> 18:53.280
No, thank you. I've got one.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.120
What is it?

19:02.120 --> 19:03.920
Is it a chair leg?

19:06.240 --> 19:08.200
Soon we found a dual carriageway,

19:08.200 --> 19:11.160
and, at last, the traffic
started to move.

19:14.200 --> 19:15.520
Freedom!

19:19.000 --> 19:21.360
That's it, that's the end!

19:25.920 --> 19:28.840
We headed west, towards the lakes,

19:28.840 --> 19:32.360
surprised at how easy this
exploring was turning out to be.

19:33.640 --> 19:37.280
This is just tremendous. This
is like being in northern France.

19:41.320 --> 19:42.720
Look at that ahead.

19:42.720 --> 19:46.440
Ha-ha, Hammond,
you don't need a Subaru.

19:46.440 --> 19:49.120
This road is fantastically smooth.

19:49.120 --> 19:51.000
Apparently it was built
by the Chinese

19:51.000 --> 19:53.240
in exchange for some oil deal.

19:53.240 --> 19:55.680
It's like the Swiss have done it,
or some Austrians.

19:57.560 --> 19:59.680
Yeah, right now,
we could be on the M4.

20:00.960 --> 20:04.480
But the point is, further on,
if things get tough, if we end up

20:04.480 --> 20:06.200
off this road and on tracks,

20:06.200 --> 20:08.880
the other two will be
completely stuffed.

20:08.880 --> 20:10.400
I will have the last laugh.

20:12.440 --> 20:13.520
Wow!

20:15.600 --> 20:16.640
It's my town!

20:19.760 --> 20:21.320
We've just entered Jezza.

20:23.800 --> 20:25.440
Oh, no!

20:25.440 --> 20:28.240
When I say we've just entered Jezza,
that's a disgusting thought.

20:28.240 --> 20:31.320
We've come into Jezza.
No, we haven't come into Jezza.

20:33.640 --> 20:36.040
Even though we were
on an important mission,

20:36.040 --> 20:39.320
I decided we should pull over
and have a look around.

20:42.120 --> 20:43.600
Jezza church.

20:43.600 --> 20:46.200
They've actually had a church
where they worship me.

20:47.600 --> 20:49.320
Protect and serve?

20:50.400 --> 20:53.560
I've never seen that
and those close.

20:53.560 --> 20:55.320
That doesn't make any sense at all.

20:56.800 --> 20:58.040
My name is Jezza.

20:58.040 --> 20:59.200
Your name is Jezza?

20:59.200 --> 21:00.920
My name is Jezza.

21:00.920 --> 21:02.480
What do you think of that?

21:05.840 --> 21:07.880
You'll like this, James.

21:07.880 --> 21:10.520
There is Jezza's back alley.
Well found.

21:12.080 --> 21:15.720
At this point, to demonstrate that
Hammond's car was too small,

21:15.720 --> 21:17.600
James and I bought him a present.

21:18.840 --> 21:20.720
Oh!

21:20.720 --> 21:21.840
Do you like it?

21:21.840 --> 21:24.440
We like it, because it's really
the dralon. Yeah.

21:24.440 --> 21:27.200
Because we know you like dralon
because you're from Birmingham.

21:27.200 --> 21:29.960
And we know that you like
the peacock and cheetah blend

21:29.960 --> 21:33.240
which gives an African and
yet Birmingham flavour. Yes.

21:33.240 --> 21:35.600
And I've put it in my car
and we know it fits.

21:35.600 --> 21:38.720
We know it fits, and mine.
It fits in both our cars.

21:38.720 --> 21:40.320
Does it? Yes, it does.

21:40.320 --> 21:41.360
Does it really? Yes.

21:41.360 --> 21:42.760
Precisely into your car?

21:42.760 --> 21:44.200
It's snug.

21:44.200 --> 21:45.760
Snug.

21:45.760 --> 21:49.120
Anyway, Hammond. There are plenty
of people here who can help you.

21:49.120 --> 21:51.080
Good. Let's pop it in
the back of my car.

21:53.280 --> 21:55.600
OK, now, maybe I could...

21:55.600 --> 21:57.520
I think he's started
to dye his hair.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.120
Do you?

22:00.120 --> 22:02.360
Have a look. He's 45 and
there isn't a grey hair.

22:02.360 --> 22:04.240
You know Paul McCartney? Yeah.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.320
Have a look at that.

22:07.160 --> 22:08.320
I think if I maybe...

22:09.440 --> 22:11.000
Oh, easy, yeah. That'll fit.

22:14.680 --> 22:15.800
Yeah.

22:16.880 --> 22:17.960
Erm...

22:17.960 --> 22:20.360
Is it nearly in? Let's have a look.

22:20.360 --> 22:21.760
Pretty close.

22:21.760 --> 22:24.240
What you've got now is a big
rear spoiler.

22:25.480 --> 22:26.560
That's how it runs.

22:26.560 --> 22:28.720
Right, I think it's time to
pull out of Jezza.

22:28.720 --> 22:30.440
I just hope no-one sees me doing it.

22:33.200 --> 22:37.040
'As we headed further West,
we discovered that rural Uganda

22:37.040 --> 22:39.360
'is the world capital
of the speed hump.'

22:42.560 --> 22:43.600
Oh, God!

22:44.600 --> 22:46.440
BOTTOM SCRAPES

22:46.440 --> 22:48.400
Ah-ya-ya!

22:48.400 --> 22:51.840
James is now regretting
selecting the R.

22:51.840 --> 22:53.680
Oh!

22:55.000 --> 22:57.800
If they get any bigger,
I've had it, if I'm honest.

22:59.360 --> 23:01.640
'Annoyingly, though,
the speed mountains

23:01.640 --> 23:04.480
'didn't seem to worry the agri-yob.'

23:04.480 --> 23:06.880
Easy. No problem, goodbye.

23:06.880 --> 23:07.960
Ah!

23:07.960 --> 23:11.440
'But Jeremy and I suffered,
for mile after graunching mile.'

23:14.120 --> 23:15.160
Oh!

23:20.400 --> 23:22.280
That's it, no more.

23:22.280 --> 23:23.960
Apart from that one.

23:23.960 --> 23:26.600
But that really was
the absolute last one.

23:26.600 --> 23:27.880
Whoa!

23:27.880 --> 23:29.560
Oh, my God!

23:30.800 --> 23:32.600
Oh!

23:32.600 --> 23:34.520
Relax.

23:34.520 --> 23:35.680
Not yet.

23:39.280 --> 23:42.320
'As night started to fall,
it was time to look for a hotel.'

23:44.960 --> 23:46.040
Oh!

23:47.720 --> 23:50.800
'And Hammond thought we'd stand
a better chance of finding one

23:50.800 --> 23:53.360
'if we switched to the side roads.'

23:53.360 --> 23:55.200
'Which was a great idea(!)'

23:55.200 --> 23:56.280
Whoa!

23:57.720 --> 23:58.920
Whoa!

23:58.920 --> 23:59.960
I can't stop!

24:01.000 --> 24:02.800
Oh! You idiot!

24:02.800 --> 24:05.280
I can't stop it!

24:05.280 --> 24:07.760
Well, I can't stop it, either!

24:07.760 --> 24:09.800
I'm enjoying the sounds
of disaster behind me.

24:11.680 --> 24:13.800
Hammond, there had better
be a really good hotel

24:13.800 --> 24:15.480
at the end of this.

24:15.480 --> 24:18.640
These buildings down here,
there'll be a very nice hotel.

24:18.640 --> 24:20.240
One of those with a posh book in it.

24:22.120 --> 24:24.480
So, in your mind, because
there's tea being grown,

24:24.480 --> 24:27.960
there's a sort of plantation house
with a veranda and somebody saying,

24:27.960 --> 24:29.880
"Would you like a gin sling?"

24:29.880 --> 24:33.400
People in white linen suits with
hats on have to come to tea

24:33.400 --> 24:36.320
plantations to test and buy tea
for supermarkets.

24:36.320 --> 24:38.160
I've seen it on the television.

24:38.160 --> 24:39.600
They will need hotels to stay in,

24:39.600 --> 24:42.680
there will be one near the tea
plantation, if not in it.

24:42.680 --> 24:43.720
Fact.

24:53.840 --> 24:55.880
Hammond.

24:55.880 --> 24:57.040
'What?'

24:57.040 --> 24:59.040
If we're about to rejoin
that main road,

24:59.040 --> 25:02.120
I'm going to have to get out and
kill you very slowly, I'm afraid.

25:04.320 --> 25:06.840
I believe that is what has happened,
yeah.

25:09.680 --> 25:11.760
Still, at least it's
a lovely evening.

25:16.960 --> 25:20.280
There you go. I told you there
would be a hotel, and there it is.

25:27.760 --> 25:30.240
I don't see anybody coming out to
help with our luggage.

25:31.320 --> 25:32.760
So, let's go and check in.

25:52.800 --> 25:53.920
Jesus.

25:57.400 --> 25:59.440
That is characterful, isn't it? No.

26:00.960 --> 26:03.680
Have you heard of those
boutique hotels?

26:03.680 --> 26:05.760
Small,
with a style all of their own?

26:08.920 --> 26:10.400
You're getting that room.

26:10.400 --> 26:12.320
This one's got a chair and a table.

26:15.680 --> 26:18.880
I don't think you'd even notice
the smell after a while.

26:22.320 --> 26:24.760
Oh, my God.

26:26.880 --> 26:28.680
Hammond!

26:38.480 --> 26:40.880
The next morning,
desperate to redeem himself,

26:40.880 --> 26:44.560
Hammond called an emergency
breakfast meeting.

26:44.560 --> 26:47.160
Let's just face reality here.

26:47.160 --> 26:51.120
We're in Africa, and we're not in a
big, touristy bit of Africa, are we?

26:52.200 --> 26:53.280
No.

26:53.280 --> 26:58.280
All the hotels are going to be like
that or worse, and I've had an idea.

26:58.280 --> 27:00.680
If you suggest camping,
there will be a live

27:00.680 --> 27:02.480
and celebrated television death.

27:02.480 --> 27:04.280
Your love affair with tenting...

27:04.280 --> 27:05.440
No, I'm not camping.

27:05.440 --> 27:06.520
It's not, I...

27:06.520 --> 27:08.920
Let me finish. I haven't said tents.

27:08.920 --> 27:11.600
We've all three got estate cars,
yeah? Yes.

27:11.600 --> 27:14.040
Why don't we sleep in the cars?

27:14.040 --> 27:16.800
We can control it, it's ours,
they're dry, warm...

27:18.240 --> 27:19.360
Just get in the car.

27:19.360 --> 27:20.760
Actually, that's not a bad idea.

27:20.760 --> 27:22.720
Get a sleeping bag,
sleep in your car.

27:22.720 --> 27:27.320
I could get a mattress that hasn't
got excrement all over it.

27:27.320 --> 27:31.000
But seriously, you could get
a mattress in your car, easy.

27:31.000 --> 27:33.160
I could easily get one.
I'm not sure about you.

27:33.160 --> 27:34.920
Did you have that as an idea?

27:34.920 --> 27:36.040
He sort of did, yeah.

27:36.040 --> 27:39.400
Come on, it's like camping,
but it's not camping,

27:39.400 --> 27:40.680
because there's no tents.

27:40.680 --> 27:43.400
No, you're right, it's a good idea,
but don't do that, "Come on,"

27:43.400 --> 27:45.800
as if we're supposed to go,
"Hammond, you're brilliant,

27:45.800 --> 27:48.480
"you've redeemed yourself with quite
a good idea." He hasn't.

27:48.480 --> 27:50.680
And this is where you've brought
me for breakfast.

27:50.680 --> 27:53.200
No breakfast, then, obviously,
because Christ The King,

27:53.200 --> 27:54.560
as it turns out, is shut.

27:54.560 --> 27:57.480
Which means that Christ The King
hasn't risen yet.

27:57.480 --> 27:58.880
That's the problem.

28:00.800 --> 28:03.280
Right, come on. It's a plan,
it's stuff to do.

28:04.800 --> 28:05.880
'We split up,

28:05.880 --> 28:09.360
'and set about getting the stuff
we'd need to convert our cars.'

28:11.920 --> 28:15.440
The best hotel room I ever stayed in
was in South Beach, in Miami,

28:15.440 --> 28:19.880
and what I'm going to try and do
is replicate the decor there

28:19.880 --> 28:21.520
in the back of my Beemer.

28:21.520 --> 28:23.000
Morning. Morning.

28:23.000 --> 28:24.600
Do you have any white cotton?

28:24.600 --> 28:28.080
Oh, and it's got a cockerel on it.

28:29.240 --> 28:32.280
Yeah, I'll have one of them
and the kettle. Thank you.

28:39.480 --> 28:40.520
Nails? Yeah.

28:43.360 --> 28:44.440
Deal.

28:54.440 --> 28:55.600
There we go.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.480
And this is half inch? Perfect.

29:00.200 --> 29:02.640
That's quite a lot, isn't it?
That's more than I expected.

29:02.640 --> 29:05.320
I didn't think it was this long,
I'll be honest.

29:13.400 --> 29:15.360
Erm...

29:15.360 --> 29:17.200
HORN BEEPS

29:17.200 --> 29:19.040
Oh!

29:19.040 --> 29:20.160
Sorry!

29:24.000 --> 29:25.080
Yes.

29:27.840 --> 29:31.120
This kind of size, for me. Small.

29:32.800 --> 29:34.160
Standard size.

29:35.560 --> 29:37.400
5' 7" is enough.

29:37.400 --> 29:38.640
Well, 5' 7" and a half.

29:40.400 --> 29:43.480
'With all our materials bought,
we set to work.'

29:48.360 --> 29:49.960
This is epic!

29:54.360 --> 29:57.400
'And then met up to
reveal our creations.'

30:00.280 --> 30:02.280
Gentlemen,
behold the future of exploring.

30:02.280 --> 30:03.600
I've given this some thought.

30:03.600 --> 30:05.360
It'll be a mouse cage.

30:05.360 --> 30:06.640
No. Look! Wow!

30:06.640 --> 30:07.840
Let me talk you through it.

30:07.840 --> 30:10.240
I'm just going to climb into
the sitting area at the back,

30:10.240 --> 30:12.960
but it's not just a sitting area -
note the footwell for the feet.

30:12.960 --> 30:14.760
Where the spare wheel was? Yeah.

30:14.760 --> 30:15.800
Where's that now?

30:15.800 --> 30:17.960
It's gone. There's a bin in here.

30:17.960 --> 30:21.080
But you can't fail to notice
the kitchen.

30:21.080 --> 30:25.600
Burners, gas, taps,
running water, cold and cold.

30:25.600 --> 30:27.280
Do these work? Yes, yes.

30:27.280 --> 30:28.880
So you've got a gas bottle in here?

30:28.880 --> 30:29.960
Yes.

30:29.960 --> 30:31.080
OK. No, that's fine.

30:31.080 --> 30:33.720
And a storage cupboard,
full of useful things for me.

30:33.720 --> 30:37.000
Along here, everything
I need for cooking and eating.

30:37.000 --> 30:39.160
And where do you sleep? There.

30:39.160 --> 30:40.920
There's the bed. You see?
Let me get out.

30:40.920 --> 30:42.160
Leopardskin sheets.

30:42.160 --> 30:44.840
We are in Africa.
Come and have a look, see.

30:44.840 --> 30:47.360
You can go in by the side entrance.

30:47.360 --> 30:48.400
Question.

30:48.400 --> 30:50.880
Yes? Our gift.

30:50.880 --> 30:52.440
Well, there wasn't room for it.

30:52.440 --> 30:56.000
Actually, that is
now my upstairs sitting room.

30:56.000 --> 30:57.040
Is it?

30:57.040 --> 31:00.120
Well, let's move on to have a
look at May's car, shall we?

31:01.200 --> 31:04.280
You will see a gentleman
explorer's quarters.

31:04.280 --> 31:06.760
It's got a globe,
it's got a telescope, it's got maps,

31:06.760 --> 31:08.120
it's got music.

31:08.120 --> 31:10.040
It's a library, James. Yeah.

31:10.040 --> 31:13.480
Things you don't need when you're
looking for the source of the Nile.

31:13.480 --> 31:14.960
Number one, library.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.760
Well, if you look carefully, you'll
see some of the books are about

31:17.760 --> 31:21.080
exploring, plus there's a selection
of English poets to read in bed.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.880
Do any of the books contain the
exact location of the true source

31:23.880 --> 31:26.600
of the Nile, in which case it's
a rather wasted exercise anyway?

31:26.600 --> 31:27.800
No, but it's inspiration.

31:27.800 --> 31:29.520
So there's a library in the front.
Yes.

31:29.520 --> 31:32.480
And I'm guessing, in the back,
some kind of dungeon.

31:33.480 --> 31:35.600
Whoa! That's not a dungeon, is it?

31:35.600 --> 31:39.280
It's a living quarters
combined with a workshop.

31:39.280 --> 31:41.840
That's... I'm genuinely astonished.

31:41.840 --> 31:44.400
Would you like me to run through
what's in there? Not really.

31:44.400 --> 31:46.200
May I just sneak in, do you mind?
Yes.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.840
That doesn't look terribly
comfortable.

31:48.840 --> 31:51.440
It's been good enough for the Army
for several hundred years.

31:51.440 --> 31:53.040
And this will just make you itch.

31:53.040 --> 31:56.680
It's an itchy blanket. It's designed
to remind you how lucky you are.

31:56.680 --> 32:01.360
So you can cook food for us, you can
mend mechanical things that go wrong.

32:01.360 --> 32:02.840
Keep us going. What have you done?

32:02.840 --> 32:04.800
What have I done? Yes.

32:04.800 --> 32:06.640
You might want to come
and have a look.

32:06.640 --> 32:09.440
I should warn you, there are two
electronic things on this car.

32:09.440 --> 32:13.920
The throttle, which is broken,
and the electronic boot release,

32:13.920 --> 32:18.520
which is broken,
so I've fitted a manual replacement.

32:18.520 --> 32:19.720
And there you are.

32:19.720 --> 32:23.440
What I've done is I've filled it with
Egyptian cotton and duck down.

32:23.440 --> 32:25.080
Erm...

32:25.080 --> 32:27.280
Is that a coffin? Yeah.

32:27.280 --> 32:29.920
Who knew a coffin was dual purpose?

32:29.920 --> 32:31.240
But it is.

32:31.240 --> 32:35.600
It could be used for bodies, or I've
used it as a chest of drawers.

32:35.600 --> 32:38.840
Washing things, clean clothes,
dirty clothes and shoes.

32:38.840 --> 32:40.640
Can I just say, it's all very nice,

32:40.640 --> 32:43.480
but you haven't
considered your colleagues' needs.

32:43.480 --> 32:47.240
Well, there are two features on this
car that you might be interested in.

32:47.240 --> 32:52.120
In the front, gentlemen, we find
here, instead of a passenger seat...

32:52.120 --> 32:54.200
Oh, so you have thought
of sustenance, a fridge.

32:54.200 --> 32:55.520
That's good, that's good.

32:55.520 --> 32:57.600
And it runs off the cigarette
lighter in the car.

32:57.600 --> 32:59.560
That's a tradable commodity
you've got there.

32:59.560 --> 33:03.720
It is, but something even more
useful than beer.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.080
No, actually, no.

33:05.080 --> 33:08.280
Nearly as useful as beer is
what I've fitted over here.

33:09.320 --> 33:10.960
A shower.

33:10.960 --> 33:13.360
And if we peel back the curtain...

33:13.360 --> 33:15.000
Oh, it's a complete
bathroom in there.

33:15.000 --> 33:18.440
Oh, yeah.
So, you lower this window...

33:18.440 --> 33:19.800
It lowers it automatically?

33:19.800 --> 33:21.440
Hang on. Yes, it does, but...

33:22.680 --> 33:23.720
It's not going.

33:23.720 --> 33:26.560
There are three electrical components
on this car, as it turns out.

33:26.560 --> 33:29.080
I get it. The window goes down, and
that lowers the bog seat,

33:29.080 --> 33:30.480
is that right? Yes, exactly.

33:30.480 --> 33:34.040
That's quite theatrical.
It doesn't work, but it's very...

33:34.040 --> 33:35.760
Well, the battery's somehow
gone flat.

33:35.760 --> 33:39.280
I suspect the fridge is drawing
quite a lot of power. Mmm.

33:39.280 --> 33:41.440
Can I have a jump?
No.

33:47.480 --> 33:51.000
'With the BMW re-energised,
we set off once more for the lakes.'

33:55.120 --> 33:57.840
'So, here we are now,
Livingstone, Burton and Speke

33:57.840 --> 34:00.640
'in full explorer mode.'

34:02.200 --> 34:04.840
James, with those modifications,
will have added,

34:04.840 --> 34:07.320
got to be getting on for a tonne,

34:07.320 --> 34:09.360
which will have reduced his ground
clearance

34:09.360 --> 34:12.719
from one inch to much less
than one inch.

34:12.719 --> 34:13.760
What an idiot.

34:22.120 --> 34:23.280
I have made it quite heavy.

34:24.280 --> 34:26.120
'Still, could be worse.'

34:41.360 --> 34:44.800
I've uncovered one design
feature in here that I don't like.

34:45.880 --> 34:47.560
The driver?

34:47.560 --> 34:51.040
No. Every time I brake,
my curtain closes.

34:51.040 --> 34:52.120
Braking.

34:56.679 --> 34:59.480
'Despite my terrible hardship,
we carried on,

34:59.480 --> 35:01.480
'and soon we turned off the road

35:01.480 --> 35:03.800
'where the speed humps
were frequent...

35:06.080 --> 35:08.760
'..and onto a road where
they were continuous.'

35:13.160 --> 35:14.320
Oh, God!

35:16.120 --> 35:19.360
Nice. Washboard gravel.
My favourite.

35:21.120 --> 35:24.080
'Once again,
though, the agri-yob was unfazed.'

35:27.200 --> 35:29.040
More like it.

35:29.040 --> 35:31.160
Finally, I get to do some
Subaru-ing.

35:33.160 --> 35:36.120
IMITATES CAR ENGINE

35:36.120 --> 35:37.160
Woo-hoo!

35:40.160 --> 35:41.200
Ha-ha-ha!

35:43.440 --> 35:47.640
Because we were now off the beaten
track, we started to encounter

35:47.640 --> 35:50.640
more animals, but sadly,
as we saw in Botswana,

35:50.640 --> 35:55.080
the Top Gear cameramen do struggle
when they're not filming cars.

35:56.560 --> 35:57.720
No, there!

36:04.160 --> 36:06.360
Did you see that, Hammond?
It was a monkey.

36:09.680 --> 36:11.720
Did you get it?

36:11.720 --> 36:12.960
Elephant!

36:15.600 --> 36:17.240
What elephant?

36:17.240 --> 36:19.640
Elephant on the right-hand
side of the road.

36:21.640 --> 36:23.480
Oh, this is strangely familiar,

36:23.480 --> 36:26.320
you telling me about animals that
you've just seen that I haven't.

36:26.320 --> 36:27.400
Ha-ha-ha!

36:29.280 --> 36:30.800
Oh, you evil sod!

36:30.800 --> 36:32.960
That reminds me
of a television programme.

36:32.960 --> 36:35.480
James, can you think what that
television programme was?

36:35.480 --> 36:36.800
Shut up, shut up!

36:36.800 --> 36:39.160
Shut up, shut up, shut up!

36:39.160 --> 36:42.040
Was it Richard Hammond coming to
you from a tent in the dark?

36:42.040 --> 36:43.480
Was it that one?

36:43.480 --> 36:46.120
Hammond, there was a little man,
and he kept saying,

36:46.120 --> 36:48.320
"I've had an amazing day,
I've seen lots of animals,

36:48.320 --> 36:50.880
"but sadly, this is live
and it's dark now."

36:50.880 --> 36:52.040
Shut up!

36:56.040 --> 36:58.440
'Eventually,
we arrived at Lake Edward.'

37:00.520 --> 37:03.480
Whoa, that's a beautiful lake.

37:05.760 --> 37:09.080
'So beautiful, in fact, we decided
to stop on its shoreline

37:09.080 --> 37:11.440
'for a night in our new
accommodation.'

37:13.400 --> 37:16.080
Right, let's pitch the tents. Done.

37:16.080 --> 37:17.680
Beer? It's already chilled.

37:17.680 --> 37:20.000
That would be lovely.
I'll put dinner on.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.880
Oh, God! What?

37:21.880 --> 37:23.440
My bed's gone out of alignment.

37:23.440 --> 37:25.280
Oh, you've got problems.
There we go.

37:25.280 --> 37:27.280
What's your problem?
Nothing.

37:27.280 --> 37:28.680
No, what's your problem?

37:28.680 --> 37:31.240
Nothing. I think the chair,
the fringe has just slightly...

37:31.240 --> 37:33.320
What is your problem?
Oh, dear!

37:33.320 --> 37:36.120
Is this every single thing?
I'm just going to tidy up.

37:36.120 --> 37:38.160
It's Hammond's kitchen nightmare.

38:02.600 --> 38:04.520
'We sat and watched the sun go down,

38:08.600 --> 38:11.680
'looking forward to Heston Hammond's
delicious dinner.'

38:15.360 --> 38:17.560
I'm enjoying the bean course.
Yeah, good.

38:17.560 --> 38:19.920
What's next? Beans.

38:19.920 --> 38:22.480
Can you honestly not cook anything
other than beans? No.

38:24.640 --> 38:26.720
What's that? Fly paper.

38:27.840 --> 38:30.520
Do you still not like insects?

38:30.520 --> 38:32.760
You know, they've got their place.

38:32.760 --> 38:34.920
In the world, or something.

38:34.920 --> 38:36.000
Is it in your car?

38:36.000 --> 38:37.080
No.

38:37.080 --> 38:38.880
'Then, it was time for bed.'

38:42.480 --> 38:47.040
Nobody in the history of Africa has
ever been more comfortable than this.

38:47.040 --> 38:49.600
I'm under a layer of duck down and
Egyptian cotton,

38:49.600 --> 38:55.040
I'm watching Kristin
Scott Thomas in a film where she's
bound to do lesbionics at some point.

38:56.480 --> 38:57.640
I've had some beans.

38:59.840 --> 39:01.240
Oh, this is just heaven.

39:36.560 --> 39:37.880
HORN BLOWS

39:37.880 --> 39:39.280
What's for breakfast?

39:39.280 --> 39:40.840
Beans.

39:43.800 --> 39:47.440
'Today, our exploring would
begin in earnest,

39:47.440 --> 39:50.240
'but first, we had to mend
Jeremy's car, again.'

39:52.520 --> 39:55.040
What you need
under here is an M8 screw,

39:55.040 --> 39:59.760
and a home-made little clip made
out of tin, which I've got in there.

39:59.760 --> 40:00.920
Easy.

40:00.920 --> 40:02.120
'While I was doing this,

40:02.120 --> 40:05.840
'Jeremy had time to develop
one of his theories.'

40:05.840 --> 40:09.920
Gentlemen, this is a map, OK,
of what all these famous explorers

40:09.920 --> 40:12.720
told the Victorian English
was Africa.

40:12.720 --> 40:14.400
Now, look at the Sahara Desert.

40:14.400 --> 40:17.400
Which is really tough and difficult,
we've been there, it's horrible.

40:17.400 --> 40:20.400
All done, every nook
and cranny explored.

40:20.400 --> 40:21.600
This is really tough.

40:21.600 --> 40:22.960
Sudan, impossible.

40:22.960 --> 40:24.040
Awful. All done.

40:24.040 --> 40:28.120
But, here, in this pleasant
garden of Eden where we are now,

40:28.120 --> 40:30.400
unexplored territories.

40:30.400 --> 40:31.880
What was holding them up?

40:31.880 --> 40:32.920
Here?

40:32.920 --> 40:34.160
Yes.

40:34.160 --> 40:38.200
It's not mountainous, every tree
has got food growing out of it.

40:38.200 --> 40:40.080
It's a good point,
when you think about it.

40:40.080 --> 40:42.800
There's nothing here that would
stop you. Gentle wooded hills.

40:42.800 --> 40:44.400
Temperature? Lovely.

40:44.400 --> 40:46.280
Yet they kept coming out here
and saying,

40:46.280 --> 40:48.680
"Oh, very difficult,
I must go out there for five years.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.040
"I shall probably be lost."

40:50.040 --> 40:52.520
It all stinks a bit, doesn't it?
Yeah.

40:52.520 --> 40:55.480
So let's just work it out.
England, go home.

40:55.480 --> 40:57.680
"Would you like to go to Mrs
Simpson's piano recital

40:57.680 --> 40:58.800
"this evening?"

40:58.800 --> 41:02.800
Or they come out here,
dusky maidens, lovely temperature,

41:02.800 --> 41:06.160
very pleasant views,
great food, get a tan.

41:06.160 --> 41:07.600
Write home, tell them it's awful.

41:07.600 --> 41:09.000
Yes, exactly.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.920
Send a letter. "Dear Mrs Hammond.

41:10.920 --> 41:12.760
"It is with a heavy heart that
I write to say

41:12.760 --> 41:14.840
"we have not seen
Richard for three years."

41:14.840 --> 41:17.400
"He's in the vice-like grip of,
what's that name? Fever?

41:17.400 --> 41:19.720
"I'll put that in. Malaria, yeah."

41:19.720 --> 41:22.680
Basically, our conclusion is that
Victorian explorers were just

41:22.680 --> 41:24.800
a bunch of hoorays on a very
long gap year.

41:24.800 --> 41:25.880
Yes. Yes.

41:25.880 --> 41:28.320
Is that right?
Well-funded gap year here.

41:32.240 --> 41:35.560
With all that cleared up,
we set off to do exploring.

41:36.680 --> 41:40.080
Our task was to scour the
perimeter of Lake Edward to see

41:40.080 --> 41:45.120
if any of the rivers we crossed were
flowing into it from the lake below.

41:45.120 --> 41:47.520
If it turned out these lakes
were joined,

41:47.520 --> 41:52.280
we would head south to find the
true source of the River Nile.

41:57.960 --> 42:00.160
Follow me. River this way, gentlemen.

42:04.360 --> 42:07.720
Right, this is actual off-road,
and it's starting to rain.

42:09.560 --> 42:11.080
Oh, BLEEP!

42:11.080 --> 42:12.120
That's more like it.

42:12.120 --> 42:15.040
Feeling confident about your choices
of car now, chaps?

42:15.040 --> 42:18.240
Are we moving, Hammond, or not?

42:18.240 --> 42:21.560
Yes. The question is for how long,
and James, you've gone very quiet.

42:22.600 --> 42:24.320
Yeah, yeah.

42:24.320 --> 42:26.280
This car is just masterful.

42:27.480 --> 42:29.640
Whoa!

42:32.960 --> 42:36.680
'James's masterful Volvo was now
minus its protective skid plate.'

42:36.680 --> 42:37.880
Oh, dear.

42:37.880 --> 42:39.760
Oh, look, it's all under the car.

42:41.960 --> 42:45.840
"They laboured for six long months
to cut off the plastic spoiler."

42:45.840 --> 42:48.200
You do that, I'll go
and write to your loved ones.

42:48.200 --> 42:51.040
Would you, would you?
Make it sound a bit better.

42:51.040 --> 42:53.560
Put a lion in it, some fever.

42:53.560 --> 42:55.200
Build it from there.
Exactly.

42:59.880 --> 43:03.280
'With the Volvo mostly mended,
we got back to exploring,

43:03.280 --> 43:07.200
'and unlike the Victorian hoorays,
we decided not to shilly-shally.'

43:08.920 --> 43:10.720
This is Top Gear exploring.

43:12.400 --> 43:13.600
High-speed exploring!

43:16.920 --> 43:18.520
This is good.

43:18.520 --> 43:19.840
We will cover some ground.

43:21.520 --> 43:24.320
'In the racing Volvo, though,
life was not so good.'

43:26.120 --> 43:27.520
Ah!

43:29.480 --> 43:30.680
This is going to be bad.

43:31.880 --> 43:32.920
Ah, ah!

43:34.720 --> 43:36.440
I'm going to have to
stop for a minute.

43:38.720 --> 43:40.160
HE GROANS

43:40.160 --> 43:42.880
'Our colleague
was in considerable pain.'

43:46.080 --> 43:47.640
'So we left him behind.'

43:51.200 --> 43:52.720
"Dear Mrs May."

43:52.720 --> 43:56.160
"James has suffered a terrible
back injury wrestling a lion."

43:56.160 --> 44:00.440
"He will be home, in maybe five
years. Please send money."

44:03.880 --> 44:05.560
River, Hammond, river.

44:05.560 --> 44:07.040
Oh, hello, exploring to be done!

44:08.520 --> 44:10.600
'We needed for it
to be flowing north.'

44:11.840 --> 44:13.960
I've got 68 degrees east.

44:13.960 --> 44:15.080
Yeah.

44:15.080 --> 44:16.120
It's no good to us.

44:18.120 --> 44:21.280
Here we go. More exploring.

44:21.280 --> 44:23.320
Yes, now I've got a siren.

44:23.320 --> 44:24.920
SIREN BLARES

44:31.720 --> 44:33.240
It's going that way, east.

44:34.880 --> 44:35.920
River.

44:37.080 --> 44:39.520
That's the angle
I want you to tell me.

44:39.520 --> 44:41.680
East. It's no good.

44:43.360 --> 44:45.840
'When Captain Backache caught up...'

44:45.840 --> 44:47.840
Whoa!

44:47.840 --> 44:51.440
'We still hadn't found a river
flowing in the right direction.'

44:53.360 --> 44:56.800
I think this is our final bridge.
I think it's the last river.

45:00.640 --> 45:05.280
We don't need to throw a stick in
that to see which way it is
flowing, do we? Not really.

45:05.280 --> 45:06.480
It is going that way.

45:08.480 --> 45:11.560
Sort of southeast. Southeast? Yeah.

45:17.840 --> 45:21.960
'Our theory about the two lakes being
connected was in tatters.

45:23.120 --> 45:26.040
'Our expedition seemed to
be at an end.

45:27.640 --> 45:31.400
'So that night in camp,
the mood was despondent.

45:34.720 --> 45:39.360
'But then, while poring over
the maps, I noticed something.'

45:39.360 --> 45:41.840
Wait a minute, wait a minute...

45:43.360 --> 45:47.600
Hammond! May! What? Come here,
come here, come here.

45:53.240 --> 45:56.840
You see it says here, "source du
Nile"? Yes. Source of the Nile.

45:56.840 --> 45:59.920
That is Joanna Lumley's, and that is
the furthest the water has to

45:59.920 --> 46:03.160
fall down a very wiggly river
yes? Yes.

46:03.160 --> 46:05.040
This one is in Burundi,

46:05.040 --> 46:08.480
this is the furthest the crow
flies from the exit of the Nile.

46:08.480 --> 46:10.240
OK? Yes. Yes.

46:10.240 --> 46:14.800
I believe they are both wrong.
Right.

46:14.800 --> 46:17.600
Where is the exit of the Nile?

46:17.600 --> 46:21.200
Alexandria,
which you can see on this. There.

46:21.200 --> 46:24.480
So their rivers flow through
Lake Victoria

46:24.480 --> 46:28.040
and then go there to another sea,
inland sea, effectively.

46:28.040 --> 46:30.920
The Mediterranean isn't even
tidal, just like Lake Victoria.

46:30.920 --> 46:34.080
The actual exit of the
Nile is Gibraltar,

46:34.080 --> 46:38.920
because that is where it goes into
the ocean. The ocean is here.

46:38.920 --> 46:42.800
Their sources are both to
the west of Lake Victoria.

46:42.800 --> 46:44.600
I see what you mean.

46:44.600 --> 46:48.080
We are looking for a river
on the east side of Lake Victoria.

46:48.080 --> 46:50.440
Do you see what I mean?
Because it is further...

46:50.440 --> 46:52.680
It is further from Gibraltar.

46:52.680 --> 46:55.240
And I have found it.

46:55.240 --> 47:02.040
Gentleman, the actual source of
the Nile is around there.

47:03.200 --> 47:05.360
Southeast of Lake Victoria.

47:05.360 --> 47:08.400
That is as far from Gibraltar
as you can get. You follow a river

47:08.400 --> 47:11.480
called the Grumeti, or it's a
tributary of the Grumeti,

47:11.480 --> 47:13.080
which I have traced back.

47:13.080 --> 47:17.480
I can't work out exactly where
it is but it is about here.

47:17.480 --> 47:21.160
That is the furthest as the crow
flies and it is the furthest
the water flows.

47:21.160 --> 47:24.160
That is extremely good.

47:24.160 --> 47:27.400
We are here, we have
to get from where

47:27.400 --> 47:30.760
we are on completely the wrong side
of Lake Victoria to the other side,

47:30.760 --> 47:33.640
that is going through
Rwanda, Tanzania, to there.

47:33.640 --> 47:37.280
It is such a long way.
It is a long way.

47:37.280 --> 47:39.080
It's worth it though, isn't it?

47:48.000 --> 47:49.360
'The next morning,

47:49.360 --> 47:53.080
'the Top Gear crew prepared for the
long journey that lay ahead.

47:55.400 --> 47:59.680
'Hammond, meanwhile, cooked
breakfast.' Oh, careless.

48:00.840 --> 48:04.600
'And I fitted a new skid plate to
protect the underside of my Volvo.'

48:06.920 --> 48:11.720
'Nobody is allowed to
use my car as a lavatory any more.'

48:22.000 --> 48:23.560
THUMPING

48:23.560 --> 48:26.280
You can hear my improvised
guard working there,

48:26.280 --> 48:29.520
protecting my vital intercooler
from mud and sharp points.

48:30.640 --> 48:32.800
To be honest it is
a bit of an improvisation,

48:32.800 --> 48:34.720
it's not the thickest steel
there is.

48:34.720 --> 48:37.080
You have to work with what you've
got out in the bush.

48:45.320 --> 48:48.520
I had a cold shower this morning,
my penis was like a press stud.

48:50.680 --> 48:51.720
Again.

48:57.680 --> 49:05.600
Out into the wilderness, in my
little mobile house. Hello, chaps.

49:05.600 --> 49:09.040
Are you both stuck?
'Are you stuck, James?'

49:09.040 --> 49:13.360
'I have gone into a bit of a soft
bit, are you stuck?'

49:13.360 --> 49:15.600
I tell you what, let's find out.

49:20.000 --> 49:23.640
Oh, come on! Ha-ha-ha!

49:23.640 --> 49:26.760
I've improved
the style of the Subaru no end!

49:26.760 --> 49:30.040
I'm free as well. Ha-ha-ha!

49:30.040 --> 49:33.680
Thank you, guys, that was a trap,
wasn't it? A bit, yes.

49:34.920 --> 49:36.480
You evil sods.

49:39.520 --> 49:43.320
We pointed our cars at the border
with Rwanda and set off on

49:43.320 --> 49:49.080
a 600-mile journey to what we now
knew was the true source of the Nile.

49:55.720 --> 49:59.840
I wonder if we are heading towards
that massive rain cloud.

50:00.920 --> 50:02.280
Yes, we are, aren't we?

50:13.280 --> 50:15.840
MUSIC: "Africa"
by Toto

50:28.880 --> 50:33.400
As the miles rolled by, we started to
climb into the mountains.

50:42.920 --> 50:46.800
Oh, wow, this is
very, very pretty, here.

50:47.960 --> 50:51.880
'But, we couldn't really admire the
view, because the road was starting

50:51.880 --> 50:56.880
'to be a bit of a test for two
of the 1,500 quid second-hand cars.'

50:58.240 --> 51:00.400
My bash plate is
earning its keep today.

51:02.680 --> 51:04.440
Oh, cock.

51:07.680 --> 51:12.680
Oh. We are both in the same boat
here, James and I.

51:12.680 --> 51:15.480
It is called the HMS Careful.

51:19.320 --> 51:21.360
Meanwhile, far ahead,

51:21.360 --> 51:23.960
my four-wheel-drive Subaru was
scampering along.

51:25.400 --> 51:27.840
Come on, come on!

51:30.520 --> 51:32.320
I am king of the forest.

51:33.600 --> 51:35.920
Bloody hell, look at this one.

51:48.920 --> 51:51.360
Come on, beemer! Come on!

51:52.800 --> 51:54.720
How is it doing this?

51:59.760 --> 52:00.880
Ooh...

52:04.760 --> 52:06.960
Absolutely no chance.

52:08.200 --> 52:13.000
'Annoyingly, I had to ask the
agri-yob to come back and help.'

52:13.000 --> 52:17.960
What is the expression about pig
in... It's Hammond in mud?

52:17.960 --> 52:22.120
Yeah, it'll pull out.
Give him a tug. I'm going to.

52:25.560 --> 52:29.800
Did it hit you? Yes, it did
What was that?

52:29.800 --> 52:32.520
It was a huge chunk of
tree just bounced off...

52:32.520 --> 52:37.040
And smashed my windscreen. Has it?
Yeah. We probably should get
a move on. I will back it up.

52:37.040 --> 52:40.320
James, get your tow rope out.
Go, go, go.

52:42.560 --> 52:44.880
'As I pulled James free...'

52:44.880 --> 52:47.480
Yes! Bloody brilliant, Hammond.

52:47.480 --> 52:50.280
'..some locals arrived
and Jeremy decided

52:50.280 --> 52:54.280
'to give them a quick lecture
on his theories
of off-road driving.'

52:54.280 --> 52:59.360
Now, I believe in speed. Power.

52:59.360 --> 53:03.400
Power and speed solves many things.

53:04.160 --> 53:08.600
Right... James, how far?
Middle of the puddle.

53:08.600 --> 53:11.280
(THROUGH MEGAPHONE) Speed and power!

53:19.520 --> 53:21.400
LAUGHTER

53:22.440 --> 53:27.720
Go faster! Speed and power doesn't
work. It was doing quite well.

53:27.720 --> 53:30.280
To be honest,
I was surprised you got that far.

53:31.760 --> 53:37.920
Do you think you could push it out?
Yeah. Yes? OK.

53:37.920 --> 53:41.840
Which way...? Oh, I've got
to get out of the way. These guys
are immensely strong.

53:52.040 --> 53:54.440
Drive back, drive back. OK.

54:00.080 --> 54:02.160
Good going!

54:04.560 --> 54:05.640
There you go.

54:07.280 --> 54:11.760
'Having freed Jeremy, the men
started to build him a new road.'

54:15.040 --> 54:18.600
I wouldn't do that bare
feet, I can't watch.

54:20.160 --> 54:22.480
I am assuming
he has never got it wrong

54:22.480 --> 54:24.560
because he still has
an entire right foot.

54:30.280 --> 54:36.240
OK. Three, two, one!

54:46.360 --> 54:48.400
APPLAUSE

54:48.400 --> 54:52.080
Yes! Well done, that
was amazing. Well done.

54:52.080 --> 54:54.920
Thank you, guys, that is amazing.

54:54.920 --> 54:56.800
'With my dues paid...'

54:56.800 --> 54:58.880
Thank you, thank you.

54:58.880 --> 55:00.280
'..we were back on our way.'

55:01.440 --> 55:04.840
It is amazing, those guys actually
turned out to be Ugandan army.

55:06.440 --> 55:09.120
Up here training.
God, they are strong.

55:10.440 --> 55:13.280
'We hoped that that would be
the last of the mud,

55:13.280 --> 55:16.720
'but as the day went on
it got even worse.'

55:18.680 --> 55:22.400
Oh, no, I have no steering.
No, no, no!

55:23.080 --> 55:26.040
Go! Thank you.

55:27.880 --> 55:29.040
It is beached.

55:32.040 --> 55:33.400
Bloody hell.

55:35.480 --> 55:37.640
Thank you. Hit it.

55:45.200 --> 55:46.240
Oh, cock.

55:48.240 --> 55:52.280
We are just going to blow the
clutches to pieces.
Going to have to pull it out.

55:55.360 --> 55:58.720
Go on, go on, go on,
you son of a... Ha-ha-ha!

56:01.720 --> 56:06.080
SCREAMING

56:06.080 --> 56:08.680
That was so damn close.

56:08.680 --> 56:14.920
'And then, to add to the misery, I
discovered there had been treachery.'

56:14.920 --> 56:19.920
How long has that been there?
Good grief! You must have...

56:19.920 --> 56:24.200
Hammond, I know what your panto face
is. Hammond, where is that?

56:24.200 --> 56:27.560
What are those really big things?
They could rip steel.

56:27.560 --> 56:29.960
I know exactly where it is.

56:29.960 --> 56:33.320
I have no idea and you will never
get it out of me. May!

56:33.320 --> 56:36.480
Is that thing on the front
of your car made out of my door?

56:36.480 --> 56:37.680
(Yes, it is.)

56:39.560 --> 56:41.760
Is that my door? What?

56:41.760 --> 56:45.480
It is from my door,
I know it is from my door.

56:45.480 --> 56:49.600
You're not using that bit
and it was more useful on my car.

56:49.600 --> 56:54.360
You didn't even notice. That's it,
that's it. Can you give me a tow? No!

57:01.400 --> 57:05.040
As evening drew in,
conditions started to improve.

57:08.840 --> 57:14.000
This is all feeling a bit Gorillas
In The Mist. It's a bit mystical.

57:14.000 --> 57:15.400
It is kinda wonderful.

57:17.400 --> 57:21.320
'Thanks to my door,
the Volvo had survived the ordeal.

57:21.320 --> 57:24.680
'But in the BMW,
my throttle problem was even worse

57:24.680 --> 57:27.080
'and my handbrake had broken.'

57:27.080 --> 57:30.960
Hammond, keep moving, I can't stop,
I can't do hill starts any more.
Keep going.

57:32.840 --> 57:36.720
This has to be one of the toughest
days we have ever had on Top Gear.

57:37.880 --> 57:41.280
There hasn't been a single moment
when one of us wasn't stuck.

57:42.040 --> 57:45.840
No car is built to survive
conditions like this. None.

57:45.840 --> 57:47.360
Not one.

57:47.360 --> 57:51.960
'And there were still more
than 500 miles to go.'

57:57.520 --> 58:00.360
Hammond is hot on my tail in the
quest for the source of the Nile.

58:00.360 --> 58:03.040
And now Rwanda.

58:05.320 --> 58:08.400
Oh, my God.
That might have killed the car.

58:08.400 --> 58:11.480
There she goes. Oh, yes!

58:11.480 --> 58:14.920
Gently, gently. We are going in.
Stop!

58:17.520 --> 58:19.640
30 seconds.

58:19.640 --> 58:20.680
Oh!

58:22.320 --> 58:23.360
I'm through.

58:24.480 --> 58:27.360
BLEEP Hammond is not having this.
