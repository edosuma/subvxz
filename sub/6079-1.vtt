02:26.021 --> 02:28.069
I'm an attorney.
This isn't how I argue.

02:28.231 --> 02:29.699
You're getting on my nerves!

02:29.858 --> 02:33.658
This building has been here 75 years. It
deserves to remain for the community...

02:33.820 --> 02:36.369
because it represents
the ideals of that time!

02:36.531 --> 02:40.286
The community deserves to have this as
a landmark. It is something to...

02:40.452 --> 02:44.332
And we're removing it from our
children's children. You go back here.

02:44.498 --> 02:48.128
This a community theater, and everyone
should benefit from this building!

02:48.293 --> 02:52.844
This is your last warning! We got
a permit to take down this building!

02:53.006 --> 02:55.759
I have a permit that allows me
to gather for the purpose...

02:55.926 --> 02:58.805
of expressing my constitutional
right of free speech!

02:58.970 --> 03:02.474
- You want to get killed, lady?
- Sir, according to city code...

03:02.641 --> 03:05.770
- Forget about your code!
- Section 245: If a committee...

03:05.977 --> 03:11.609
- Forget about the code, lady!
- When a landmark's committee decision...

03:11.775 --> 03:14.904
- Lady, you're in violation!
- Have you ever read the Constitution?

03:15.070 --> 03:17.414
Take it up, Charlie!
Watch this constitution.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.870
- Do you read?
- Clear the area!

03:20.033 --> 03:22.001
Yeah, you're clear. Go ahead.

03:27.416 --> 03:29.839
Okay, you guys,
this is just a scare tactic.

03:30.001 --> 03:32.424
- That's all this is.
- Well, it's sort of working.

03:32.587 --> 03:37.184
Meryl, they do productions from the
Y here, productions with little people!

03:37.342 --> 03:42.599
The Nutcracker and Hair. We have to
lie down in protest. Take out your mats.

03:42.973 --> 03:46.477
Here, I've got your protective eye gear,
your sun block and your wet naps.

03:46.643 --> 03:50.693
- Everybody, lie down in protest!
- Get out of the way.

03:50.856 --> 03:53.655
- We will prevail!
- You will go to jail!

03:53.817 --> 03:56.366
Tom! Lock arms.

03:56.528 --> 03:59.577
- I'm not feeling great about this.
- Have a little faith.

03:59.740 --> 04:02.835
Meryl, would you marry me?

04:02.993 --> 04:04.620
Really?

04:05.287 --> 04:09.008
Oh, my God! Yes!

04:09.166 --> 04:11.919
Shut it down, Charlie.

04:16.214 --> 04:19.844
- I love you.
- Hey, you guys, they stopped.

04:20.010 --> 04:24.015
You're good luck. There is justice
in the world. We prevailed!

04:24.181 --> 04:26.149
Lunatic!

04:27.684 --> 04:30.358
Crazy lady!

04:33.648 --> 04:35.241
- We should call our parents.
- Yeah.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.447
Here are your wet naps.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.578
- Oh, thanks.
- Thanks. We had a good time.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.080
- I'm glad. Bye.
- Bye.

04:40.238 --> 04:42.536
Bye. Thank you.

04:42.699 --> 04:45.043
I'll pay you back
this time, guys. I promise.

04:45.202 --> 04:49.082
What are parents for, if not to bail their
daughter and her friends out of jail?

04:49.247 --> 04:51.875
So did they knock it down?

04:54.169 --> 04:57.890
I'm not getting through to people.
Why don't people respond to me?

04:58.215 --> 05:01.719
Honey, Wade Corporation is not people,
it's a heartless profit machine.

05:01.885 --> 05:03.979
And it's getting worse all the time.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.265
They're bidding
on the Surf Avenue lot.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.934
They wanna put up condos
and tear down the center.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.853
Wait, our community center?
My community center?

05:12.020 --> 05:14.398
Come on, honey,
let's discuss it over dinner.

05:14.606 --> 05:18.361
No, Dad, you know what? I'm just tired.
I think I'll just go home.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.758
<i>Hi, honey, it's Ansel.</i>

05:36.920 --> 05:39.594
<i>I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna
make it back for your birthday.</i>

05:39.756 --> 05:43.806
<i>We got a lot of new trainees on board
and they put the green in Greenpeace.</i>

05:43.969 --> 05:46.722
<i>But I'm saving whales
and thinking of you. Love you.</i>

05:46.888 --> 05:50.483
Yeah, hi, Mr. Wong.
Lucy Kelson.

05:51.268 --> 05:55.444
Fine. I would like a number 17...

05:55.605 --> 05:59.405
a number fou... Number five.

05:59.568 --> 06:04.199
No. Number seven?
Seven.

06:04.364 --> 06:09.621
Can I get the number four
without the garlic sauce?

06:09.786 --> 06:15.759
Okay, and then maybe
two orders of number 26.

06:15.917 --> 06:17.294
And...

06:18.378 --> 06:20.506
Yes, it's for one.

06:20.922 --> 06:24.096
And that's it.
No! Give me a number eight.

06:24.259 --> 06:25.886
Give me two number eights.

06:26.052 --> 06:27.099
Okay.

06:27.262 --> 06:28.479
Okay.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.517
Okay. Bye.

06:52.662 --> 06:56.212
When they told me I'd been chosen
the Medical Center's Man of the Year...

06:56.374 --> 06:58.422
I assumed it had
something to do with...

06:58.585 --> 07:01.008
the millions we contributed
to the pediatric wing.

07:01.171 --> 07:05.301
But as it turns out, I had my appendix
removed earlier this year...

07:05.467 --> 07:08.095
and under anesthesia,
I apparently proposed marriage...

07:08.261 --> 07:09.854
to every nurse in the hospital.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.109
Including the many
attractive male nurses.

07:16.853 --> 07:19.356
Why are pediatrics
so important to Wade?

07:19.522 --> 07:21.741
I think feet are very important,
aren't they?

07:21.900 --> 07:24.779
I'm just teasing. I know there's
more to pediatrics than feet.

07:24.945 --> 07:28.791
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you. Always nice to see you.

07:28.949 --> 07:31.327
- George, congratulations.
- Terry, how are you?

07:31.493 --> 07:33.120
- Still slicing?
- Indeed.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.378
I bet you are.

07:34.537 --> 07:38.587
Hi, there. Oh, yes, the Emile family.
Lovely. So good.

07:38.750 --> 07:41.720
- Hi.
- Nice to see you. Take care.

07:41.878 --> 07:44.927
- Melanie Corman. Administration.
- Ah-ha.

07:45.090 --> 07:48.469
My friend Elaine Cominsky wants to
meet you, but she's shy. Is that okay?

07:48.635 --> 07:51.263
That's fine. I've been too nervous
to meet Elaine myself.

07:51.429 --> 07:55.309
- Good. Don't move. Great tie.
- Thanks. I was rather nervous about it.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.522
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:56.685 --> 08:00.189
- Hey, your brother wants to see you.
- What? Now? Tonight?

08:00.355 --> 08:05.031
That's what he said. Although sometimes
it's hard to tell with the accent.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.287
This is Elaine.

08:07.445 --> 08:10.665
- Oh, hello.
- Hi. Would you sign my <i>GQ?</i>

08:12.659 --> 08:14.081
GQ! I see what you mean.

08:14.244 --> 08:17.168
Sorry, I thought it was a medical term.
You had me all excited.

08:18.081 --> 08:21.961
- "To Elaine, George Wade."
- Thank you.

08:22.127 --> 08:23.299
Hang on just one second.

08:23.461 --> 08:26.590
There's no way I'm running up
to Westchester just because he calls.

08:26.756 --> 08:29.384
It's absurd. He'll just have to wait.

08:29.551 --> 08:32.475
- Right on. Hey, man, forget him.
- Yeah.

08:32.636 --> 08:34.809
- Should I get the car?
- Yes, get the car.

08:48.278 --> 08:51.498
- Good evening, Mr. George.
- Good evening, Rosario.

08:51.656 --> 08:55.206
- Excellent new hairdo.
- Mr. George.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.998
No, I'm serious. You look like
a young Imelda Marcos.

09:00.707 --> 09:02.584
- Hello, George.
- Hello, Helen.

09:02.751 --> 09:05.425
Don't you think Rosario
looks particularly lovely tonight?

09:05.587 --> 09:09.308
I hadn't really noticed.
Rosario, the children need baths, please.

09:09.466 --> 09:11.434
Yes, Miss Helen.

09:11.926 --> 09:15.055
- So how are the kids, apart from dirty?
- They're fine.

09:15.221 --> 09:18.395
- Can I get you anything?
- I'd love some Milk Duds.

09:18.850 --> 09:21.444
We don't have any.
I could send out for one.

09:21.603 --> 09:25.858
Oh, no, don't be ridiculous. If you're
going to send out, get a whole box.

09:26.149 --> 09:29.073
- Howard is in the gym.
- Right.

09:29.235 --> 09:35.493
Forty-five minutes, 6.5 miles an hour,
at an elevation of three.

09:37.410 --> 09:41.415
It's incredible how much
more relaxed I feel.

09:41.581 --> 09:45.381
- Helen does an hour a day too.
- Yes, you both seem extremely relaxed.

09:45.543 --> 09:48.262
You can cut the relaxation
with a knife.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.765
So why am I here, Howie?

09:52.258 --> 09:56.388
We lost the West Side waterfront deal
because your chief counsel...

09:56.554 --> 10:00.809
your latest model-slash-attorney...

10:00.975 --> 10:03.979
forgot to file
an Environmental Impact Report.

10:04.145 --> 10:06.864
I will admit that the law
is not Amber's strong point.

10:07.023 --> 10:09.367
- That's why I fired her.
- No, 1 fired her.

10:09.526 --> 10:13.030
Just as I fired Debbie
from St. Barts' Law School...

10:13.196 --> 10:16.166
and Stacy from Online Law School.

10:16.324 --> 10:20.830
I want someone from Yale or Columbia
or from the continental United States.

10:21.287 --> 10:24.587
Women of that level of intellectual
ability often find me shallow.

10:24.749 --> 10:27.298
- Then hire a man.
- Don't be absurd.

10:27.460 --> 10:29.462
Because they wouldn't sleep with you?

10:29.629 --> 10:33.008
No, because it would make you
and Dad too happy.

10:33.508 --> 10:35.431
Dad has been dead for 10 years.

10:35.593 --> 10:38.893
Well, there is no reason for him
to start enjoying himself now.

10:40.098 --> 10:44.774
Get someone who can write
a brief instead of removing yours.

10:44.936 --> 10:47.234
And she can handle your
divorce while she's at it.

10:47.397 --> 10:50.150
You are still getting divorced?

10:50.316 --> 10:56.665
Unless my ex-wife decides to fall in love
with me again, or for the first time, yeah.

10:58.199 --> 11:01.578
No! Why do you
always find that so funny?

11:01.744 --> 11:05.465
- It's very hard to say.
- Hire a real attorney by tomorrow.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.339
Don't!

11:19.095 --> 11:21.939
- Hello, have a good day.
- Thank you, ma'am.

11:22.098 --> 11:24.396
- So you're Russian, you say?
- 100%.

11:24.559 --> 11:28.735
Hence, blond hair,
blue eyes, cheekbones.

11:28.897 --> 11:32.618
Sorry to have kept you so long, but at
least I feel I know everything about you.

11:32.775 --> 11:37.121
And I you. You know, usually I'm so
nervous at interviews, but that was fun.

11:37.280 --> 11:41.535
Yes. Isn't fun fun?
It's been a pleasure, Tiffany.

11:44.287 --> 11:46.289
Mr. Wade? Mr. Wade?

11:46.456 --> 11:48.458
Hi, I'm Lucy Kelson.
I'm an attorney.

11:48.625 --> 11:50.798
Have you ever heard
of Saint-Tropez Law School?

11:50.960 --> 11:52.962
- No.
- What a shame.

11:53.129 --> 11:55.257
- Where did you go to law school?
- Harvard.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.141
- Harvard?
- Yes.

11:57.300 --> 12:00.053
Intriguing. Tell me more.
What's your background?

12:00.220 --> 12:03.645
I don't see how that's relevant. I work
for the Coalition for the Homeless.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.649
- At Legal Aid.
- That can't pay much.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.560
I'm not very interested in money.

12:09.687 --> 12:12.031
Wait a minute.
You're Kelson.

12:12.190 --> 12:14.284
You lie in front of
our wrecking balls.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.661
- You attacked the Zegman brothers...
- I did not.

12:16.819 --> 12:19.242
It's not my fault they walked
under a protest sign.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.658
- You're not here for a job?
- I'm representing...

12:21.824 --> 12:24.543
the Coney Island Community Center.
It was built in 1922.

12:24.702 --> 12:27.831
It's the heart of Coney Island.
It has adult education, basketball...

12:27.997 --> 12:31.672
CPR, Lamaze, water ballet,
senior's tae kwon do. It's great.

12:31.834 --> 12:33.711
For children, it's a home
away from home.

12:33.878 --> 12:35.972
I mean, I practically grew up there.

12:36.130 --> 12:39.179
It's lovely, but Trump has the
inside track. Nice to meet you.

12:39.342 --> 12:40.969
No, Mr. Wade,
you don't understand.

12:41.135 --> 12:42.853
I live there,
as well as my parents.

12:43.012 --> 12:45.231
They know Assemblyman Perez,
who's on the board.

12:45.390 --> 12:49.987
If you can guarantee the preservation of
this center, I'll guarantee you the build.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.030
But why us?
Why Wade?

12:53.398 --> 12:57.904
Well, I can't get in to see Trump and
the Zegmans have a restraining order.

12:58.236 --> 12:59.613
Mr. W.?

13:01.114 --> 13:03.867
You're supposed to be taping
The View in half an hour...

13:04.033 --> 13:08.664
and <i>Public Policy</i> needs a quote
on the challenges of urban planning. Hey.

13:08.830 --> 13:12.050
Right. Yes. Quote, quote,
quote, quote...

13:12.208 --> 13:15.758
What I love about architecture
is its ability to shape a community.

13:15.920 --> 13:20.391
This center has shaped the community!
It turns strangers into neighbors...

13:20.550 --> 13:23.144
Its ability to change
strangers into neighbors.

13:23.303 --> 13:26.102
How the right design for a park
can make people feel secure.

13:26.264 --> 13:30.360
How a school building can be functional
and beautiful so that kids feel...

13:30.518 --> 13:35.570
No, the community center makes children
feel engaged. It allows them a place...

13:35.732 --> 13:39.737
Functional and beautiful so that kids
feel engaged instead of imprisoned?

13:39.902 --> 13:41.404
- Yeah, sounds good.
- I like that.

13:41.571 --> 13:44.074
But I said a community center,
not a school.

13:44.240 --> 13:47.995
I know, it's all very good.
Jump in. Thanks.

13:49.579 --> 13:52.002
- Nice shirt.
- Thank you.

13:59.172 --> 14:02.597
So do we have a deal?

14:02.759 --> 14:06.559
No. I want something else from you.

14:06.721 --> 14:12.273
No. I'm fully aware of your reputation
and there's no way you're getting that.

14:12.435 --> 14:14.904
- Getting what?
- You know.

14:15.063 --> 14:17.691
The sex.
That's not gonna happen.

14:17.857 --> 14:23.330
No, that would be nice, but what
I really need is a new chief counsel.

14:24.113 --> 14:26.992
Well, I think I would
prefer the sex, because...

14:27.158 --> 14:30.788
Okay, if you take the job, I promise
to save your community center.

14:30.953 --> 14:32.921
You can direct our pro bono efforts.

14:33.081 --> 14:36.756
That's millions of dollars
at your charitable disposal.

14:37.293 --> 14:38.795
You couldn't possibly want me.

14:38.961 --> 14:42.090
I've spent my life
working against people like you.

14:42.256 --> 14:45.351
Well, maybe if you work for me,
you'll win occasionally.

14:45.510 --> 14:47.933
- I... I don't...
- I need an answer immediately.

14:48.137 --> 14:50.890
Here is my direct number
at the Grand Hotel.

14:51.057 --> 14:54.186
- You live at a hotel?
- Well, I own the hotel and I live there.

14:54.352 --> 14:56.025
My life is very much like Monopoly.

14:56.187 --> 15:01.535
And I know you wouldn't care,
but I'll start you at $250,000.

15:04.153 --> 15:06.747
There's also usually
a very nice Christmas bonus.

15:08.366 --> 15:10.118
Thank you.

15:25.341 --> 15:27.594
- Hi, Lu.
- Hey, Rocco.

16:11.012 --> 16:13.731
- I can't believe how much I ate.
- I'm proud of you.

16:13.890 --> 16:15.938
The whole left side of the menu.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.194
You know when I get tense,
I just start to eat.

16:18.352 --> 16:23.950
- Honey, you cannot work for that man.
- Hey, we can use the bail money.

16:24.108 --> 16:26.031
- Remember what Sun Tzu said?
- Yes.

16:26.194 --> 16:29.869
"Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer."

16:30.031 --> 16:32.159
Sun Tzu didn't have a daughter.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.961
What's this?
Oh, dessert. Thank you.

16:35.119 --> 16:37.998
It's the only way to save
the community center.

16:38.164 --> 16:40.087
It is. And if I work for him...

16:40.249 --> 16:44.004
I have huge resources at my
disposal for charities and shelters...

16:44.170 --> 16:46.719
- Yes, but...
- Mom, I promise.

16:46.881 --> 16:49.805
I will still be your daughter.
I will still be a lawyer.

16:49.967 --> 16:53.221
And I will still have
all the same ideals.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.103
Let's update all the files.

16:58.601 --> 17:02.231
Especially the muni-codes
because I'll need those.

17:02.396 --> 17:04.740
I'm gonna speak with Mr. Wade.

17:04.898 --> 17:06.276
Mr. Wade, so sorry to bother.

17:06.442 --> 17:09.787
I've been over the Environmental
Impact Reports for Island Towers.

17:09.945 --> 17:12.165
- I would really love to talk to you.
- Very good.

17:12.323 --> 17:15.327
I really wanted to ask you:
Which one of these do you prefer?

17:15.492 --> 17:16.493
How do you mean?

17:16.520 --> 17:19.397
It's for my new
personalized stationery.

17:19.539 --> 17:23.794
Is this a trick question?
They look exactly the same to me.

17:23.960 --> 17:29.592
No, not at all. This is a linen finish
and this is a watermarked vellum finish.

17:29.757 --> 17:33.478
Leaving aside the fact that they've
taken perfectly good forests...

17:33.636 --> 17:37.140
and denuded them in order
to produce this nonrecyclable paper...

17:37.306 --> 17:40.685
I would say it was...

17:48.317 --> 17:51.366
Well, then this one. It tastes better.

17:57.326 --> 17:59.920
Do you know, I've asked
30 people that question.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.956
You're the only one to come up
with that.

18:02.123 --> 18:03.170
Hmm.

18:03.332 --> 18:06.836
My God, you're good.
I'm getting you a bigger office.

18:07.003 --> 18:10.098
No, it's very sweet,
but I'd rather go over the...

18:13.426 --> 18:15.428
Very firm.

18:16.679 --> 18:18.147
But is it too firm?

18:18.306 --> 18:22.527
There's debate among chiropractors
about the optimum level of tension.

18:22.685 --> 18:23.811
What are your thoughts?

18:23.978 --> 18:26.982
If you really want to know,
the more firm the mattress...

18:27.148 --> 18:31.369
the more pressure on the 5th vertebra
leading to herniation and subluxation.

18:31.527 --> 18:32.870
Hmm.

18:34.864 --> 18:37.287
Quite bouncy, though.
Have a bounce.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.827
No.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.967
- Hello.
- Yes, I'm glad you're up.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.845
I didn't want to wake you.
I just felt like a chat.

18:50.004 --> 18:53.008
George, it is 2:15 in the morning.

18:53.174 --> 18:55.848
Can't you talk to whatever
Mensa candidate you're with?

18:56.010 --> 18:57.387
I resent the implication...

18:57.553 --> 19:00.272
that because someone
may not share your high IQ...

19:00.431 --> 19:02.274
they're not a person of substance.

19:02.433 --> 19:04.435
- Wow.
- You all right?

19:04.602 --> 19:06.479
I swallowed my Altoid.

19:07.146 --> 19:10.741
She swallowed her Altoid. That can
happen. A sudden hair flick, dangerous.

19:10.900 --> 19:13.904
Okay, George, I am tired.
Put her on the phone.

19:14.403 --> 19:16.246
You mean, put her on the phone?

19:16.697 --> 19:19.075
Put her on the phone!

19:19.241 --> 19:21.118
All right. Someone for you.

19:24.246 --> 19:26.715
- Hi.
- Hi.

19:26.874 --> 19:30.253
The man you're dancing
with is deeply troubled, okay?

19:30.419 --> 19:32.717
<i>And even though he's rich
and attractive...</i>

19:32.880 --> 19:35.759
you're too young to trade
yourself like a stock on NASDAQ...

19:35.925 --> 19:38.303
for someone who won't
remember your name...

19:38.469 --> 19:40.813
or his in the morning,
is still married...

19:40.971 --> 19:44.896
and has recently had
a very suspicious rash.

19:46.185 --> 19:47.482
<i>If is 2:16.</i>

19:47.645 --> 19:50.990
Go home, finish high school
and reach your potential!

19:51.899 --> 19:53.401
You all right?

19:53.567 --> 19:55.569
I think I'm gonna go.

19:56.904 --> 20:01.535
- What did you say to her? Nice chat?
- Yes, she seemed very special.

20:01.701 --> 20:06.377
Okay, I've got to get up early
for a divorce case, so I have to go.

20:06.539 --> 20:10.589
Yes. Now that we have to talk about.
Now, do you think I should cry?

20:10.751 --> 20:14.221
I was thinking perhaps
little machine gun bursts of sobs.

20:16.465 --> 20:19.560
A little more hysteria,
more of a whimper than a sob.

20:19.719 --> 20:22.689
You're pathetic. Good night.

20:24.598 --> 20:26.316
All right.

20:40.948 --> 20:44.077
I'm sure he'll be here any minute.
Is there any more Diet Coke?

20:49.957 --> 20:51.004
Sorry, everybody.

20:51.167 --> 20:54.842
Did I miss the blessed event?

20:56.088 --> 20:58.011
Check with me before you talk.

20:58.174 --> 21:01.303
Now that we're all here, I'd like
to discuss the settlement terms.

21:01.469 --> 21:03.813
The terms have been set.
It's called a prenup.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.018
We both know...

21:05.181 --> 21:08.151
that a prenup doesn't preclude
certain recompensatory...

21:08.309 --> 21:12.359
In English, although I can follow you
in German and Japanese if you prefer.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.239
- She wants double the alimony.
- No way.

21:16.233 --> 21:19.112
Given the situation,
it's not an unreasonable request.

21:19.528 --> 21:22.202
You're referring to the alleged
infidelity, are you not?

21:22.364 --> 21:25.459
Alleged? He was having
sex with her in our bed.

21:25.618 --> 21:28.212
I knew you were worried
to get anything on that sofa.

21:28.370 --> 21:31.499
- How dare you come in here...
- I shouldn't have said that. Sorry.

21:31.665 --> 21:33.087
Please.

21:34.877 --> 21:38.427
So you are saying that infidelity
is worth twice the alimony.

21:38.589 --> 21:40.933
Using your reasoning,
any infidelity on her part...

21:41.091 --> 21:43.890
would have to be held against her
in a monetary accounting.

21:44.053 --> 21:45.305
What are you suggesting?

21:45.471 --> 21:50.568
The soon to be ex-Mrs. Wade did a little
couch time with a company accountant.

21:50.726 --> 21:53.400
And he's willing to testify.

21:54.438 --> 21:56.907
I have loyal employees.
I think it's the health plan.

21:57.066 --> 21:58.909
- The health plan is excellent.
- Thank you.

21:59.068 --> 22:00.115
You're welcome.

22:00.277 --> 22:03.326
- We will not agree to pay any...
- We will pay the alimony...

22:03.489 --> 22:06.242
plus $100,000 and
a generous property settlement...

22:06.408 --> 22:08.957
if you release me
from further obligation.

22:09.119 --> 22:10.541
- You son of a bitch!
- What?

22:10.704 --> 22:13.332
Watch it or you will not
get the estate, Mrs. Wade.

22:13.499 --> 22:16.878
Don't call me that! You're just
another one of his stupid bimbos!

22:17.044 --> 22:20.218
Now, wait! She is far from stupid...

22:20.381 --> 22:23.180
- What do you think you're doing?
- Went up my nose.

22:23.342 --> 22:25.515
- Water went up my nose.
- It's only water.

22:25.678 --> 22:28.022
- Yes.
- This hankie is very nearly clean.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.523
- Okay.
- I'll dab you.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.025
- You may blow.
- Thank you.

22:31.183 --> 22:32.400
Good.

22:34.937 --> 22:37.406
Divorce always gives me
an appetite. Kebab?

22:37.565 --> 22:40.569
No, I've never warmed
to the idea of a flesh Popsicle.

22:40.734 --> 22:44.284
- One, please. Chicken, thank you.
- Why did you give her the money?

22:44.446 --> 22:47.370
She'd never have stopped
till she got what she wanted.

22:47.533 --> 22:50.628
You always say I have a responsibility
towards those less fortunate.

22:50.786 --> 22:53.039
Everybody is less
fortunate than you...

22:53.205 --> 22:56.926
so just give the money to someone
who's not gonna spend it on collagen.

22:57.084 --> 22:59.803
You only want me to be generous
to those you approve of.

22:59.962 --> 23:04.012
No. I only want you to
finally allow me to do my job.

23:04.174 --> 23:07.895
You did your job. This morning I was
married, now I'm not. You did superbly.

23:08.053 --> 23:09.600
Thank you very much.

23:09.763 --> 23:13.438
Here, that's fine.
You keep the change. Thank you.

23:17.021 --> 23:18.147
George.

23:21.317 --> 23:24.161
- Hey, that's my coffee, you jerk!
- Oh, sir, I'm so sorry.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.822
- Moron!
- I thought you're needy.

23:25.988 --> 23:27.865
- What's wrong?
- I thought you were needy.

23:28.032 --> 23:29.750
- Can't a guy have coffee?!
- I didn't...

23:29.909 --> 23:32.913
- Come on, Mother Teresa.
- My only cup! You ruined it!

23:33.078 --> 23:35.501
Jesus, is anyone not going
to attack me today?

23:35.664 --> 23:39.544
I'm probably not. But I do need your help
with something very important. Come on.

23:41.962 --> 23:47.184
Okay, now,
what do you think of this?

23:47.343 --> 23:51.064
Too ornate or do you
think it's belt-acular?

23:51.221 --> 23:53.849
I don't care about the belt.

23:54.016 --> 23:55.393
You're upset.

23:55.559 --> 23:58.733
Look, from now on, I'll get someone
else to handle my divorces.

23:58.896 --> 24:01.115
It's not like I enjoy them.

24:01.273 --> 24:04.197
I should go somewhere where no one
knows how much money I have.

24:04.360 --> 24:06.863
Where is Staten Island?
Why don't we go there?

24:07.404 --> 24:10.908
You could pretend to be my spinster
sister and help me find my new wife.

24:11.075 --> 24:14.796
- I'm a lawyer.
- You're the best lawyer in the world.

24:14.954 --> 24:18.128
Thanks for the compliment, but Harvard
doesn't give a degree in yenta.

24:18.290 --> 24:21.419
I'm not here to find you a wife
or to pick out your clothes.

24:21.585 --> 24:22.802
Oh, sorry.

24:22.962 --> 24:26.307
My heroes are Clarence Darrow,
Thurgood Marshall, Ruth Ginsburg...

24:26.465 --> 24:28.593
Who's another non-scummy lawyer?

24:28.759 --> 24:31.262
My parents! My father worked
for Martin Luther King.

24:31.428 --> 24:32.771
My mother is a law professor.

24:32.930 --> 24:35.604
They taught me that lawyers
should be treated with respect.

24:35.766 --> 24:40.237
I have complete respect for you.
R-E-S-P-E-C-T.

24:42.481 --> 24:45.280
Luce, wait. Wait!

24:47.152 --> 24:51.999
Dearly beloved, we are gathered
here to join together Meryl and Torn...

24:52.157 --> 24:54.660
as they stand before us
on this joyous day...

24:54.994 --> 24:59.295
proclaim their love and enter
into that most sacred bond of all...

24:59.456 --> 25:00.878
the bond of holy...

25:03.293 --> 25:04.340
<i>Is that yours?</i>

25:13.929 --> 25:16.352
I'm so sorry.

25:20.519 --> 25:23.568
Please continue. Everyone looks
so beautiful. Just keep going.

25:23.731 --> 25:26.450
Bye. You guys, I'll be right back.

25:27.776 --> 25:29.198
Hold this for me. I'll be back.

25:41.582 --> 25:43.175
Twenty bucks for your cab.

25:43.333 --> 25:45.461
- Keep the 20 and let's have dinner.
- Uh...

25:45.627 --> 25:48.130
Keep your dinner. I'll keep my 20,
we'll call it even.

25:48.297 --> 25:50.140
- Okay, sounds good.
- Okay, bye.

25:50.299 --> 25:51.676
Go.

25:55.137 --> 25:57.515
George, pick up. What's wrong?

25:57.681 --> 26:00.605
Don't tell me the construction
permits didn't come through...

26:00.768 --> 26:04.614
because I had the application
into the Zoning Committee by 9 a.m.

26:12.446 --> 26:16.371
- Evening, Miss Kelson.
- Willie, told you the Mets would sweep.

26:21.163 --> 26:24.167
- Miss Kelson.
- Ms. Hana.

26:28.128 --> 26:31.177
- Good evening, Miss Kelson.
- Linda.

26:40.724 --> 26:44.820
- George?
- Help! I'm in my closet.

26:45.729 --> 26:47.106
- George.
- Good. You're here.

26:47.272 --> 26:50.902
- What is it?
- That is a very attractive pink thing.

26:51.068 --> 26:52.194
George, what is it?

26:52.361 --> 26:56.832
I'm judging the Miss New York contest
in under an hour. It's on television.

26:56.990 --> 26:58.242
What do you think?

26:58.408 --> 27:01.753
Don't tell me you called me out of a
wedding to help you pick out a suit.

27:01.912 --> 27:05.758
- You ran out of a wedding?
- You said it was an emergency!

27:05.916 --> 27:08.544
Didn't I memo you as to what
constitutes an emergency?

27:08.710 --> 27:12.010
Yes. Large meteor, severe loss of
blood and what's the third one again?

27:12.172 --> 27:13.219
- Death!
- Death.

27:13.382 --> 27:14.679
- And you're not dead.
- No.

27:14.842 --> 27:17.095
You weren't dead when
you called me at 3:00 a. m...

27:17.261 --> 27:20.060
because you had a nightmare about
becoming a KISS member.

27:20.222 --> 27:23.101
Just like when you barged in
on my woman's doctor appointment...

27:23.267 --> 27:26.396
to ask me which picture
to put on the cover of <i>People.</i>

27:26.562 --> 27:30.237
I don't like those very much. If it's any
consolation, I will be dead eventually.

27:30.691 --> 27:34.946
Tonight is important. I'm representing the
Wade organization. That includes you.

27:35.112 --> 27:36.329
Not anymore, George.

27:37.906 --> 27:40.785
- I'm sorry?
- You got the towers, I got Coney Island.

27:40.951 --> 27:44.330
Why don't we just call it quits, okay?
I can't take it anymore.

27:44.496 --> 27:46.419
- What, are you serious?
- Yes.

27:48.750 --> 27:52.175
Please, consider this
my two weeks' notice.

27:54.339 --> 27:57.934
- I find you ungrateful.
- Ungrateful?

27:58.093 --> 28:00.767
- Yes, ungrateful.
- Ungrateful?!

28:00.929 --> 28:04.183
Yes. I hire you with
no corporate experience.

28:04.349 --> 28:07.899
I give you an apartment, an office, the
nonfat-muffin basket every morning.

28:08.061 --> 28:10.814
- George!
- Why do you keep your phone on?

28:11.190 --> 28:13.909
Because you like emergencies.
You crave the excitement.

28:15.027 --> 28:17.200
All right, George.
You are absolutely right.

28:17.362 --> 28:20.161
This has nothing to do with you.
This is entirely my thing...

28:20.324 --> 28:23.373
because I've managed
to turn myself into this...

28:23.535 --> 28:26.709
- There's not even a name for it.
- It's not like I enjoy it either.

28:26.872 --> 28:29.796
Before you came into my life
I was capable of making decisions.

28:29.958 --> 28:33.303
Now I can't. I'm addicted.
I have to know what you think.

28:33.462 --> 28:35.305
- What do you think?
- George.

28:35.464 --> 28:38.138
I think you are the most selfish
human being on the planet.

28:38.300 --> 28:41.349
That's just silly. Have you met
everyone on the planet?

28:41.511 --> 28:43.764
Goodbye, George.

28:44.932 --> 28:47.185
I don't have a shirt.

28:49.061 --> 28:52.486
Ansel, I finally quit. He called
me out of Meryl's wedding.

28:52.648 --> 28:54.742
- I'll never get that moment back.
<i>- Okay.</i>

28:54.900 --> 28:57.528
I'll interview with firms
that do pro bono work...

28:57.694 --> 28:59.071
<i>- Hang on.</i>
- What?

28:59.238 --> 29:02.162
<i>We're shipping out.
I gotta go. You take care of yourself.</i>

29:02.324 --> 29:03.917
- All right.
<i>- I gotta go, hon.</i>

29:04.076 --> 29:06.875
Okay, just don't fall in love with
any cute marine biologists.

29:07.037 --> 29:09.335
<i>- Okay, I promise. Bye.</i>
- Okay.

29:09.498 --> 29:11.796
<i>- Love</i> you.
- Bye.

29:18.799 --> 29:21.268
Lowell, Hanes and Richards.

29:21.426 --> 29:23.520
I look forward
to a new challenge...

29:23.679 --> 29:27.229
and your firm has the optimal blend
of public and private interest law.

29:27.391 --> 29:29.564
Lucy, your résumé is amazing.
You know that.

29:29.726 --> 29:31.524
But we do a lot of
business with Wade.

29:31.687 --> 29:34.110
More reason for me to
make a smooth transition.

29:34.273 --> 29:35.320
- Lucy.
- Yes.

29:35.482 --> 29:37.860
George Wade called me this morning
and informed me...

29:38.026 --> 29:41.326
that you are indispensable
to his organization.

29:43.282 --> 29:44.875
Ah.

29:45.534 --> 29:47.081
At the moment,
we're not hiring.

29:47.703 --> 29:49.250
Then why did you agree to see me?

29:49.413 --> 29:51.882
Honestly, we're partners
with Zodiac Construction...

29:52.040 --> 29:54.714
They do millions of dollars
of business with Wade Realty...

29:54.876 --> 29:57.720
- And Mr. Wade...
- Doesn't want you to hire me.

29:58.088 --> 30:00.807
The attorney who was planning
to quit reconsidered.

30:00.966 --> 30:03.014
- When did Mr. Wade call?
- He never called.

30:03.176 --> 30:05.349
- When?!
- Maybe an hour ago.

30:06.263 --> 30:08.766
Make sure you massage
his cloven hoof!

30:08.932 --> 30:10.809
I'm feeling a pain in my ass.

30:10.976 --> 30:14.071
I am unemployable! You called everyone
except for Slurpee Heaven!

30:14.229 --> 30:17.358
That is not true. I did call Slurpee
Heaven. They didn't want you.

30:17.524 --> 30:19.777
You had attitude.
You weren't Slurpee material.

30:19.943 --> 30:23.664
- You should really let us work on you.
- I don't like to be touched!

30:23.822 --> 30:26.041
I'm sorry, you guys are great.
It's not you.

30:26.199 --> 30:28.201
All right, listen.

30:28.368 --> 30:32.418
You have a contract and it says you will
work until Island Towers is finalized.

30:32.581 --> 30:36.586
Which is completion of construction,
or I can stop you working elsewhere.

30:36.752 --> 30:40.256
And there's no loopholes because
you drafted it and you're the best.

30:40.464 --> 30:45.766
I think you drafted it that way
because you don't really want to go.

30:45.927 --> 30:48.271
Does it kill you how well I know you?

30:50.182 --> 30:53.311
Honey, this contract is excellent work.
I'm very proud of you.

30:53.477 --> 30:55.320
<i>Dad, I'm trying
to get out of it.</i>

30:55.479 --> 30:58.858
I don't know why you went to work
for that philandering robber baron.

30:59.024 --> 31:00.776
<i>You usually have impeccable instincts.</i>

31:00.942 --> 31:04.321
<i>Look at your boyfriend, Ansel.
He's a dedicated environmental warrior.</i>

31:04.488 --> 31:07.617
This is ironclad. Houdini couldn't
get out of this contract.

31:07.783 --> 31:10.161
You should've stayed
at the legal aid job.

31:10.327 --> 31:13.581
If I do pro bono work with a company
with these resources...

31:13.747 --> 31:16.967
I can accomplish so much...
- Come on over for strawberry ice cream.

31:17.125 --> 31:21.471
Have Tofutti! You heard what the doctor
said. Your cholesterol is over 300!

31:21.630 --> 31:23.177
You're basically a solid.

31:23.340 --> 31:26.560
Two of the greatest legal minds
in this country arguing over dessert.

31:26.718 --> 31:29.642
Lucy, it was your choice to work
for that man.

31:29.805 --> 31:33.480
You could've done anything. You
could've clerked for the Supreme Court.

31:33.642 --> 31:35.019
I don't know what to tell you.

31:35.185 --> 31:38.029
Short of going in and
deliberately trying to get fired.

31:38.188 --> 31:40.987
<i>You stay away from that freezer!</i>

31:56.540 --> 31:58.463
Good morning, boys.

31:58.625 --> 32:03.381
Oops. Sorry, I am so late.

32:03.547 --> 32:05.424
That's fine.
We only just got here.

32:05.590 --> 32:07.684
- Forty-five minutes ago.
- Hmm.

32:07.843 --> 32:09.641
Howie, are these your kids?

32:10.720 --> 32:12.688
You know,
I've never actually met them.

32:12.848 --> 32:15.476
They are good-looking boys.

32:15.642 --> 32:19.488
That's a girl.
That's Sue and Paul.

32:19.646 --> 32:23.526
Yes, so it is.

32:23.692 --> 32:27.697
You know what?
She is gonna be a heartbreaker.

32:28.029 --> 32:30.327
- That's Paul.
- Hmm.

32:30.490 --> 32:33.243
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Sorry.

32:35.704 --> 32:38.457
So we've got the Coney Island project.

32:38.623 --> 32:41.593
I'd like to stir up some publicity
if we could.

32:44.880 --> 32:47.053
Yes, very nice.

32:50.260 --> 32:52.058
I'm...

32:54.222 --> 32:59.649
I'm working on endorsements
from local merchants.

32:59.853 --> 33:01.571
Hmm.

33:03.440 --> 33:05.158
Any thoughts, George?

33:05.942 --> 33:10.743
Yes, we were working
on some ideas there.

33:11.573 --> 33:13.041
Hiya.

33:13.867 --> 33:17.462
I thought that was a terrific meeting.
We should have more meetings like that.

33:17.621 --> 33:19.123
- Pathetic.
- What's pathetic?

33:19.289 --> 33:22.259
- You. I know what you're doing.
- I am not doing anything.

33:22.417 --> 33:25.921
You think if you come in late and spit
on the boss that will get you fired?

33:26.087 --> 33:27.805
Not in this company.

33:27.964 --> 33:30.308
- Chris.
- George.

33:33.595 --> 33:35.268
George, I have an ulcer.

33:35.430 --> 33:38.434
I don't sleep well, mostly because
you keep calling me at night.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.944
If you don't call me,
I dream you're gonna call me.

33:41.102 --> 33:43.946
I think about you in the shower,
not in a good way...

33:44.105 --> 33:47.450
but in an I'm-so-distracted-I-can't-
remember-if-I washed-my-hair way.

33:47.609 --> 33:49.452
So I wash my hair twice.

33:49.611 --> 33:52.740
So I have a hole in my stomach,
I am running out of shampoo...

33:52.906 --> 33:56.786
and today is the first time in my life
I did not give 1000 percent on the job...

33:56.952 --> 33:59.626
and I hate that feeling!

34:05.126 --> 34:09.427
- I won't call after hours.
- You will, George! You know you will.

34:10.130 --> 34:11.507
Yeah, I will.

34:12.842 --> 34:18.645
I just don't think we can see each
other professionally anymore.

34:27.649 --> 34:30.118
All right. Stay until you
find a replacement.

34:30.277 --> 34:33.531
Train him up for a couple of weeks,
then you can go to Slurpee Heaven.

34:34.197 --> 34:37.496
Thank you! I promise I will find
you somebody amazing.

34:37.659 --> 34:40.333
Somebody better than me
because I'm not even any good.

34:40.495 --> 34:43.715
- No.
- A glorified ambulance chaser.

34:45.708 --> 34:47.552
Thank you.

34:59.931 --> 35:02.400
I got it.
It's just my earring.

35:02.559 --> 35:04.561
Ah! Ah! Ow!

35:04.728 --> 35:07.151
- My hair!
- That's my overpriced belt.

35:07.314 --> 35:10.318
Just get it off!

35:11.067 --> 35:13.035
Howard.

35:13.528 --> 35:16.372
Join us.
We were just brainstorming.

35:17.073 --> 35:18.916
- Lucy?
- Yes.

35:19.075 --> 35:24.047
I was thinking it might be a good idea
to do a photo op at the build site...

35:24.205 --> 35:27.049
where George would be in the...

35:27.584 --> 35:30.838
George in the foreground,
pointing up to the sky...

35:31.004 --> 35:32.597
like this.
- Yes.

35:32.756 --> 35:37.762
Then I thought I could take my belt
off, as if to say, let's get to work!

35:37.927 --> 35:40.897
Right. Right-o.

35:41.473 --> 35:44.727
On behalf of Wade Corporation,
I thank the Community Board...

35:44.893 --> 35:47.897
for giving us the opportunity
to work with you on this project.

35:48.063 --> 35:51.283
And we look forward to seeing
all of you at the groundbreaking.

35:51.733 --> 35:53.406
I did well with those eight people.

35:53.568 --> 35:56.117
- I thought you were fantastic.
- This way, Mr. Wade.

35:56.279 --> 35:57.326
- Just Mr. Wade.
- Oh.

35:57.906 --> 36:00.625
- More.
- Great. Can we go now?

36:00.784 --> 36:03.583
Absolutely. I just want
to say hello to my folks.

36:03.745 --> 36:04.792
Your folks?

36:05.121 --> 36:06.964
Excuse me.

36:07.666 --> 36:08.792
Hello.

36:08.958 --> 36:10.050
- Honey.
- Hi.

36:10.210 --> 36:12.008
- New coat? I like it.
- Thanks.

36:12.170 --> 36:16.846
What a wonderful surprise!
We finally meet after all this time.

36:17.008 --> 36:18.305
George Wade.

36:18.468 --> 36:20.641
Mrs. Kelson, I presume.

36:20.804 --> 36:21.896
What a pleasure.

36:25.600 --> 36:32.324
Yeah. Well, I can certainly see
where Lucy gets her stare from.

36:32.482 --> 36:34.450
I'm Larry.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

36:34.609 --> 36:36.657
Thanks, Larry.
Same here.

36:36.820 --> 36:39.664
Thank you for letting Lucy quit.
It certainly made our week.

36:39.823 --> 36:42.497
- Great pleasure.
- We should get back to the office.

36:42.659 --> 36:44.627
- Come on! Have some cake.
- We can't.

36:44.786 --> 36:47.005
We're two blocks
from the apartment.

36:47.163 --> 36:48.460
- You live around here?
- Sure.

36:48.623 --> 36:51.126
- What a charming coincidence.
- It won't be charming...

36:51.292 --> 36:55.968
once you block out the sun
with this condo-hotel monstrosity!

36:57.173 --> 36:59.801
We will have a sun deck.

37:01.511 --> 37:03.730
That's something, isn't it?

37:03.972 --> 37:07.693
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate your support on this.

37:07.851 --> 37:10.695
At least you're keeping
the community center.

37:10.854 --> 37:13.858
Unless you're willing to reconsider
the entire project.

37:14.023 --> 37:16.993
That won't happen.
It is over 50 million in profits.

37:17.152 --> 37:20.656
It's immoral that any human being
should acquire that much wealth.

37:20.822 --> 37:22.495
I don't know how you sleep at night.

37:22.657 --> 37:25.160
I have a machine
that simulates the ocean.

37:25.326 --> 37:26.669
Oh, God.

37:26.828 --> 37:28.455
You're not helping yourself.

37:28.621 --> 37:30.749
- Do those really work?
- Yes.

37:31.833 --> 37:36.680
I used to come up here
when I was a kid. My special place.

37:36.838 --> 37:38.681
Yes, well, every kid needs one.

37:39.007 --> 37:42.352
I had a small one-bedroom
on Park and 91st.

37:42.677 --> 37:45.180
<i>Well, that's so very Oliver Twist.</i>

37:45.346 --> 37:48.896
Times were hard. But you
know what? We were happy.

37:50.435 --> 37:53.860
- Didn't have a view as good as this.
- It's great, isn't it?

37:54.022 --> 37:57.196
I used to take up some ice cream
and my Carole King tape...

37:57.358 --> 37:58.826
and look at the neighborhood.

37:58.985 --> 38:02.580
It's amazing what you could see.
At night, the building went downstairs.

38:02.739 --> 38:05.868
The fathers stood on one corner.
The mothers stood on the other.

38:06.034 --> 38:09.379
Kids would just ride
their bicycles around.

38:09.537 --> 38:12.040
As you can see,
not much has changed.

38:12.332 --> 38:15.552
Mr. and Mrs. Goldfarb would be sitting
in the middle of the street...

38:15.710 --> 38:20.386
saving a parking space for their
kids who were coming next weekend.

38:21.716 --> 38:24.060
And you up here on your own.

38:24.761 --> 38:27.480
It's hard to find a quiet
place in Brooklyn to think.

38:28.723 --> 38:33.024
Or to replay whatever argument
I just had with my mother.

38:34.062 --> 38:35.609
Yes.

38:35.772 --> 38:37.774
Yeah, she's terrifying.

38:37.941 --> 38:41.070
I thought she was gonna kill me
and feed me to the poor.

38:41.236 --> 38:43.580
Yeah, she's a piece of work.

38:44.572 --> 38:48.918
But for better or worse, she's the voice
in my head pushing me to do better.

38:49.077 --> 38:53.082
Challenge the accepted wisdom. Never
settle for a B instead of an A on a test.

38:53.248 --> 38:54.420
You once got a B?

38:54.624 --> 38:57.503
- Hypothetically speaking.
- Right.

38:58.253 --> 39:04.101
Of course, no matter how hard I try,
I will never live up to her expectations.

39:05.260 --> 39:09.731
Well, there are worse things in life.
Like no one having any expectations.

39:19.107 --> 39:22.111
There's something amuck
with this sponge cake.

39:22.652 --> 39:24.620
Tofu.

39:38.334 --> 39:41.679
You're not concentrating.
This offends me.

39:41.838 --> 39:43.966
Yeah, I'm sorry, Ton.

39:44.132 --> 39:45.429
I lost Lucy.

39:47.677 --> 39:51.352
I just think it's a shame because I've
come to rely on her for everything.

39:51.514 --> 39:55.690
And I trust her completely,
and she's funny.

39:55.852 --> 39:58.150
Not deliberately, of course.

39:58.313 --> 40:00.816
Hey, you know, it's probably
for the best though.

40:00.982 --> 40:03.280
Oh, yeah? Why is that?

40:03.985 --> 40:07.285
Two things I know is chess and women.

40:08.531 --> 40:13.378
Chess, it has rules, pieces,
rooks, knights, bishops.

40:13.536 --> 40:17.382
They move in predictable patterns.
Somebody wins, somebody loses.

40:17.540 --> 40:21.010
But women, they don't have
no rules, man.

40:21.169 --> 40:23.342
They move in unpredictable ways too.

40:23.504 --> 40:26.007
Nobody ever wins or loses
when it comes to women.

40:26.174 --> 40:29.519
You talk about your feelings until
your breath is sucked out your body.

40:29.719 --> 40:33.223
All men are pawns when it comes
to women.

40:33.389 --> 40:36.689
Especially a smart one like Lucy.
She's hard to control.

40:36.851 --> 40:40.321
And you know, the man
has got to be in control.

40:40.980 --> 40:43.233
Like with me.

40:43.399 --> 40:48.451
I come home. When I walk in, I know
my mama has dinner on the table.

40:49.906 --> 40:53.206
All right,
so you're still living at home?

40:53.868 --> 40:55.870
Yeah. Yeah.

40:56.245 --> 40:57.918
Of course.

41:02.543 --> 41:05.638
Here's somebody interesting,
Polly St. Clair.

41:05.797 --> 41:10.268
Well, it's a terrific résumé, Polly.

41:10.426 --> 41:12.178
Congratulations on the baby.

41:12.553 --> 41:13.600
What baby?

41:15.098 --> 41:17.942
Maybe you should check
with me before you talk.

41:18.101 --> 41:20.103
What baby?

41:22.897 --> 41:25.195
I'd like to talk about
your moot-court experience.

41:25.358 --> 41:26.450
What baby?

41:26.776 --> 41:28.904
Yeah, what baby?

41:33.408 --> 41:36.252
You should do the interviews
on your own from now on.

41:36.411 --> 41:38.630
Whatever you say, baby.

41:43.584 --> 41:46.133
Harry Raskin, Richard Beck.

41:46.295 --> 41:50.095
There's some interesting prospects
for my replacement. Let's see.

41:50.258 --> 41:51.805
Richard Kelly from Yale.

41:51.968 --> 41:53.265
No, it's gotta be a woman.

41:53.428 --> 41:54.600
What a surprise.

41:54.762 --> 41:58.392
I suppose a certain bust size would help.
Maybe some bathing-suit shots?

41:58.975 --> 42:01.979
- It will annoy Howard if it's a woman.
- Oh.

42:02.145 --> 42:03.488
- Thank you.
- Tell you what.

42:03.646 --> 42:05.774
All I want is someone
as intelligent as you...

42:05.940 --> 42:07.988
but a little less tense
and argumentative.

42:08.151 --> 42:11.280
A sort of Katharine Hepburn figure.

42:11.446 --> 42:13.164
You don't deserve Katharine Hepburn.

42:13.322 --> 42:14.790
- Audrey Hepburn.
- Also too good.

42:14.949 --> 42:16.826
Just stay away from the Hepburns.

42:16.993 --> 42:18.461
You forgot a beet.

42:18.619 --> 42:20.292
- Beet.
- Oh.

42:20.955 --> 42:22.628
Thank you.

42:35.344 --> 42:37.642
I've got that charity
tennis thing tonight.

42:37.805 --> 42:42.436
And I need to know, does this shirt
make me look a bit kind of Bjorn Borg?

42:42.602 --> 42:46.823
Ansel and I got into a huge fight,
and I think we just broke up.

42:46.981 --> 42:48.028
Really?

42:48.191 --> 42:50.990
He wants me to go
on a Greenpeace boat.

42:51.152 --> 42:52.995
He thinks I can't embrace life.

42:53.154 --> 42:55.532
Is that the case?
Because I just don't see it.

42:55.698 --> 42:57.245
I just don't see it.

42:57.533 --> 43:01.333
And by the way, how can I embrace him
when he is never here?

43:01.496 --> 43:06.969
Maybe it's me. Maybe the rose-colored
glasses have finally come off.

43:09.670 --> 43:11.047
Okay.

43:11.214 --> 43:14.184
We obviously can't leave you alone
with the stapler.

43:14.342 --> 43:16.970
I'll tell you what.
I'll cancel tennis.

43:17.136 --> 43:20.356
They always make me play with Ed Koch.
What can we do to cheer you up?

43:20.515 --> 43:21.937
Nothing. There's no solution.

43:22.100 --> 43:23.477
Good. Good attitude.

43:23.643 --> 43:25.395
I can't help it if I don't like boats.

43:27.355 --> 43:28.823
Surely not all boats.

43:28.981 --> 43:31.860
Yes, all boats.

43:33.861 --> 43:37.365
I don't understand.
What is wrong with me?

43:37.532 --> 43:39.876
At the moment,
huge quantities of alcohol.

43:40.034 --> 43:42.753
I don't know. I just seem
to drive men away.

43:42.912 --> 43:44.880
There's Ansel.

43:45.039 --> 43:47.918
There's Billy from Legal Aid
who ran off with a stripper.

43:48.084 --> 43:50.712
Gary from the Peace Corps
who married his trainer.

43:50.878 --> 43:52.926
Gary, yes.

43:53.089 --> 43:56.764
What is wrong with me? I want to know.
You're sort of a man.

43:59.762 --> 44:02.265
- All right?
- I'm good.

44:04.559 --> 44:07.608
So tell me. What's the matter with me?

44:07.770 --> 44:10.694
Well, you can be
somewhat intimidating.

44:11.232 --> 44:14.452
You could loosen up a little,
get in touch with your feminine side.

44:14.610 --> 44:18.456
- Okay, that's a good suggestion.
- Perhaps soften your appearance.

44:18.614 --> 44:24.121
Not that I don't love that look, but
you could get dolled up occasionally.

44:24.287 --> 44:27.257
I'm not going to spend hours
fluffing my hair and applying...

44:27.415 --> 44:29.133
animal-tested makeup to my face...

44:29.292 --> 44:34.765
just so I can turn myself into some
male fantasy, degrading Kewpie doll.

44:34.922 --> 44:38.096
Unless I, you know, really
like the guy or something.

44:38.259 --> 44:40.603
- You see, maybe that's the problem.
- Mmm.

44:40.761 --> 44:42.479
You don't like these guys.

44:42.638 --> 44:46.063
You drive them away because
you realize they're wrong for you.

44:46.225 --> 44:47.397
They're not wrong for me.

44:47.643 --> 44:52.615
We have all the same political goals
and ideals, all of them.

44:52.773 --> 44:56.653
Which I guess isn't very romantic,
but what can I say?

44:56.819 --> 44:59.993
I'm fine. What can I say?
I'm just not a romantic person.

45:00.156 --> 45:03.330
Never felt that way about anybody.
Nope. No.

45:03.492 --> 45:07.463
No, in high school, Rick Beck took
me parking. You know, parking?

45:07.622 --> 45:10.466
And the whole time I talked
about Nelson Mandela.

45:10.625 --> 45:12.502
Don't know why I did that.

45:12.668 --> 45:16.548
That's hard to say. I certainly would have
found it extremely erotic. Come back.

45:16.714 --> 45:18.637
I'm fine.

45:23.346 --> 45:25.394
I don't know.
Maybe I'm just not good in bed.

45:25.640 --> 45:27.187
Maybe you're not.

45:29.852 --> 45:31.854
I am.

45:32.146 --> 45:35.821
- Yeah?
- Yeah. I am really good in bed.

45:35.983 --> 45:38.702
- You might be lousy.
- No, believe me, pal.

45:38.861 --> 45:42.331
You should be so lucky because
the lawyerly exterior...

45:42.490 --> 45:47.337
don't let that fool you because
inside I am, like, a complete animal.

45:47.495 --> 45:50.840
It's, like, bobcat.
You know, it's scary.

45:50.998 --> 45:56.676
- I can see that it might be.
- No. Look, I can bend like a pretzel.

45:58.047 --> 45:59.515
I'm serious.

45:59.674 --> 46:03.349
And I'm not talking the straight kind.
I'm talking, like, the twisty kind.

46:03.511 --> 46:07.891
- I think... I think...
- Twisty, salty type of pretzel.

46:08.057 --> 46:10.560
Because that's what
men want, right?

46:10.726 --> 46:13.570
- That is their dream.
- The twisty-bobcat kind of pretzel...

46:13.729 --> 46:18.530
that's what you want, and I bet
I could give you a twisty-bobcat pretzel.

46:18.693 --> 46:20.536
Do you want it?

46:29.870 --> 46:32.419
You're a really good listener.

46:32.832 --> 46:35.176
Oh.

46:35.543 --> 46:37.386
Luce?

46:38.045 --> 46:39.718
Luce?

46:40.381 --> 46:44.227
Are you...?
Hello?

46:44.719 --> 46:46.392
Cormac!

46:46.554 --> 46:48.227
Help!

46:48.806 --> 46:49.853
Help!

47:00.276 --> 47:03.746
I'll just get her upstairs.

47:03.904 --> 47:05.577
Think you can make it?

47:05.740 --> 47:09.119
No. No, let's put her
somewhere else.

47:13.581 --> 47:15.959
Good. Good.

47:16.167 --> 47:17.589
Whoa. Whoa.

47:17.752 --> 47:19.425
There.

47:19.670 --> 47:21.422
All right.

47:22.256 --> 47:23.974
Good.

47:24.967 --> 47:27.015
She looks so peaceful
when she's asleep.

47:27.803 --> 47:29.646
Like a doll.

47:32.767 --> 47:35.236
A doll with a sinus problem.

47:35.394 --> 47:39.490
We should put a pillow under her head.
I think that helps.

47:46.614 --> 47:47.957
Good.

47:49.575 --> 47:50.701
Much worse. Interesting.

47:55.122 --> 47:58.171
Do you think we should change
her clothes?

47:58.834 --> 48:02.179
Right. Don't know where
that came from.

48:04.799 --> 48:06.301
Morning!

48:06.467 --> 48:08.765
Okay, not so loud.

48:08.928 --> 48:11.807
Hey. How are you, sweety?

48:11.972 --> 48:13.849
We didn't...

48:15.309 --> 48:18.028
Last... We didn't...

48:18.687 --> 48:20.655
it was a magical night.

48:20.815 --> 48:23.989
You made sounds I've never
heard a woman make before.

48:25.820 --> 48:27.868
We didn't...

48:28.197 --> 48:31.121
Not physically, but spiritually,
you were the best I've ever had.

48:31.283 --> 48:33.126
Oh.

48:33.285 --> 48:40.043
Whatever I did or didn't do
or said or didn't say...

48:40.209 --> 48:43.509
it was all a little mistake.

48:44.213 --> 48:46.341
Well, nothing happened.

48:49.718 --> 48:51.846
That's a relief.

48:55.349 --> 48:58.193
I'm very busy. I have work to do.
You stay there and relax.

48:58.352 --> 49:01.196
Okay, I'll see you later.

49:06.026 --> 49:07.619
Lucy!

49:08.279 --> 49:09.371
Jesus, careful.

49:11.031 --> 49:13.454
There's a June Carver to see you.

49:13.701 --> 49:16.705
- June Carver, June Carver.
- She went to Harvard.

49:16.871 --> 49:19.465
Yeah, well, so did I.
Now look at me.

49:20.541 --> 49:22.543
Norman. Norman. Norman.

49:22.710 --> 49:24.508
- Norman!
- Sorry.

49:25.546 --> 49:28.095
She didn't have a strong background
in property law.

49:28.549 --> 49:31.723
She's down from Boston.
She only wants five minutes.

49:35.055 --> 49:36.898
Lucy.

49:37.057 --> 49:38.684
Lucy.

49:38.851 --> 49:40.444
This is June Carver.

49:41.770 --> 49:44.614
- Hi. It's a pleasure to meet you.
- You too.

49:44.773 --> 49:47.652
I don't have an appointment,
so feel free to throw me out.

49:47.818 --> 49:50.492
Well, I have security on standby.

49:50.654 --> 49:53.077
- Have a seat, please.
- Thanks.

49:53.407 --> 49:56.502
Did you have Criminal
with Professor Rappaport?

49:56.660 --> 49:59.379
- Oh, my God. I'm still shaking.
- Yeah.

49:59.538 --> 50:03.634
But I have to tell you, Miss Kelson,
you are a legend there.

50:03.792 --> 50:05.794
- Me?
- Editor of the <i>Law Review.</i>

50:05.961 --> 50:09.386
The articles you wrote on the
Richmond case. You're an inspiration.

50:09.757 --> 50:11.100
Well, yeah, I...

50:11.258 --> 50:14.432
I don't have a strong background
in property, but neither did you...

50:14.595 --> 50:16.723
and look what you've accomplished.

50:16.889 --> 50:20.439
Well, you know, not that much, really.
I just...

50:20.601 --> 50:22.603
And there's this.

50:22.770 --> 50:24.272
I've never met Mr. Wade...

50:24.438 --> 50:27.282
but in <i>Public Policy</i> magazine
he was interviewed...

50:27.441 --> 50:31.787
about the challenges of urban
development and he said that...

50:31.946 --> 50:34.449
Is it ridiculous that
I'm quoting this?

50:34.949 --> 50:36.075
No, not yet.

50:36.242 --> 50:40.497
"Architecture can shape a community
and turn strangers into neighbors.

50:40.663 --> 50:43.291
The right design for a park
makes people feel secure.

50:43.457 --> 50:46.131
A school building can be functional
and beautiful...

50:46.293 --> 50:49.638
so kids feel engaged instead
of imprisoned."

50:49.797 --> 50:52.971
When I read that, it made me feel
I'd be working for a cause...

50:53.133 --> 50:54.225
not just a company.

50:57.513 --> 50:59.607
Okay. You're hired.

50:59.974 --> 51:01.317
You're Mr. Wade.

51:01.475 --> 51:03.694
Someone has to be.
Although, I didn't write that.

51:03.852 --> 51:06.355
- Lucy did.
- No, you did. I remember being shocked.

51:06.814 --> 51:10.159
We've been working together so long
it's hard to remember who did what.

51:10.317 --> 51:12.820
- Sounds like an amazing team.
- George, do you mind...?

51:12.987 --> 51:17.709
I was saying how presumptuous it was
of me to come waltzing in here...

51:17.866 --> 51:20.039
but Miss Kelson was
nice enough to see me.

51:20.202 --> 51:22.125
They're calling from
the Zoning Commission.

51:22.288 --> 51:27.670
June, why don't we set up
a proper interview for tomorrow.

51:27.835 --> 51:32.591
It's all right. It's all right.
I could finish up with June.

51:32.756 --> 51:34.679
You're not coming to the meeting?

51:34.842 --> 51:37.311
- Have I ever come to the meeting?
- Good point.

51:37.845 --> 51:40.394
- Alrighty.
- Alrighty.

51:40.556 --> 51:42.900
Stupid plant. Do something
with this, will you?

51:43.058 --> 51:45.561
Absolutely. The ficus is fired.

51:45.728 --> 51:47.696
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

51:47.855 --> 51:49.528
- So tell me...
- Yes.

51:49.690 --> 51:52.443
- ...first of all, you come from which...?
- Harvard.

51:53.068 --> 51:56.538
I was just wondering, are we still
on for the Mets game tonight?

51:56.697 --> 51:58.495
I love baseball.

51:58.741 --> 52:00.368
So are we still good?

52:00.534 --> 52:02.707
I'm a Red Sox fan, all the way.

52:02.870 --> 52:05.089
A Red Sox fan?
Interesting.

52:05.247 --> 52:09.878
You obviously have a rich fantasy life
which is a fabulous plus in this company.

52:10.044 --> 52:14.049
Okay, that means you're a Boston girl,
probably a little bit Irish, Catholic...

52:14.214 --> 52:16.592
- big family, dirty, that kind.
- Exactly.

52:16.759 --> 52:20.980
Let's go, Mets! Let's go, Mets!
Let's go, Mets!

52:21.138 --> 52:22.185
Strike him out!

52:22.348 --> 52:24.442
So, what did you think of June?

52:24.600 --> 52:25.692
Loved her.

52:26.101 --> 52:27.694
Great. Yeah, me too.

52:27.853 --> 52:30.402
Yeah, she smiled obsequiously,
flattered me constantly.

52:30.564 --> 52:34.194
She'd have no problem picking out
an ottoman. Exactly what I'm looking for.

52:34.443 --> 52:36.616
A tad weak
on the experience side, but...

52:36.779 --> 52:38.907
We went out for a drink,
talked for an hour.

52:39.073 --> 52:43.249
She's a very clever girl,
you know. Sharp.

52:45.079 --> 52:47.923
- So you guys went out for a drink...
- Uh-huh, uh-huh.

52:48.457 --> 52:51.882
She got nowhere to stay at the moment,
so I found her a room at the Grand.

52:52.044 --> 52:56.299
And I invited her to the company outing.
Turns out she's a useful tennis player.

52:56.465 --> 53:00.060
Well, I can swing a racket.

53:00.219 --> 53:02.267
Yes, I know, at my head.
I've experienced it.

53:02.429 --> 53:05.478
But listen, thanks to you
for finding her. Genius.

53:06.642 --> 53:08.565
Oh, God!
It's gonna hit us!

53:08.936 --> 53:10.529
Get out of the way. Move!

53:11.563 --> 53:13.941
- Mike, you all right?
- Yeah.

53:14.108 --> 53:16.952
- Easy, the season just started.
- Thanks, George.

53:17.111 --> 53:18.863
Next time, go to a Yankees game.

53:25.828 --> 53:27.171
Hey, look, you're on TV.

53:31.458 --> 53:33.085
<i>I don't hear you.
I don't hear you.</i>

53:36.672 --> 53:39.141
Stop it.

54:05.659 --> 54:07.002
Nice!

54:07.161 --> 54:09.038
- Nice one.
- Thank you.

54:19.298 --> 54:20.424
Ha!

54:24.303 --> 54:28.353
- Three-love.
- All right. Cool.

54:39.026 --> 54:40.573
Nice.

54:54.416 --> 54:56.418
Yeah!

54:56.585 --> 54:58.428
Mine, mine, mine! Okay!

54:58.587 --> 54:59.804
Come on!

55:16.188 --> 55:19.158
Lucy! Oh, my God,
Lucy, are you okay?

55:19.316 --> 55:21.239
Do I have a concussion?
Ask me something.

55:21.401 --> 55:25.907
- Name all the Supreme Court Justices.
- Thomas, Ginsburg, Scalia...

55:26.073 --> 55:29.077
Stevens, Kennedy, Rehnquist, Souter,
Breyer, O'Connor. Right?

55:29.535 --> 55:30.582
How should I know?

55:33.413 --> 55:34.790
Want some?

55:34.957 --> 55:36.709
Thanks, I really shouldn't.

55:36.875 --> 55:37.922
Okay.

55:44.091 --> 55:46.640
You think she's a natural redhead?

55:51.265 --> 55:53.233
You're so good at this.

56:01.608 --> 56:03.906
I was gonna give June a lift,
and Howard offered.

56:05.279 --> 56:07.623
He liked her, that is a big
strike against her.

56:07.781 --> 56:12.503
Although I will say she's an excellent
tennis player. Very nice form.

56:12.661 --> 56:15.084
- Fantastically nice form.
- Oh, man.

56:15.330 --> 56:16.957
Incredibly lithe.

56:17.124 --> 56:19.673
What? I thought
you liked her too.

56:19.835 --> 56:23.510
No, I jus...
I think I just ate too much.

56:23.672 --> 56:26.471
Really?
What did you have?

56:26.633 --> 56:30.979
Just a chili dog and some fries
and a soda...

56:31.138 --> 56:34.517
and a bag of some little girl's
cookies...

56:34.683 --> 56:37.482
and another chili dog
stuck in there somewhere.

56:37.644 --> 56:39.021
Okay.

56:39.187 --> 56:40.860
Let's try and take your mind off it.

56:41.023 --> 56:42.946
Okay.

56:43.108 --> 56:44.610
Heard from Ansel lately?

56:45.694 --> 56:47.662
I'm sorry.

56:47.821 --> 56:50.665
I've been thinking about this.
You should move on. Forget him.

56:50.824 --> 56:54.499
Plenty of other pebbles on the beach.
The world is be full of men who'd die...

56:54.661 --> 56:57.255
to be with a compulsive
eater who can't fall in love.

56:57.414 --> 56:59.837
What? I've fallen in love.

57:00.000 --> 57:01.673
- Yeah?
- Yes!

57:01.835 --> 57:04.429
With whom, might I ask?

57:04.588 --> 57:05.680
And no pets.

57:13.388 --> 57:15.140
Billy Westhouse.

57:15.682 --> 57:16.899
Billy who?

57:17.059 --> 57:20.188
Westhouse.
I knew him in high school.

57:20.354 --> 57:22.607
Did you tell Billy that you loved him?

57:22.773 --> 57:26.323
Did you say, "Billy, I love you"?

57:35.994 --> 57:37.587
Ow!

57:38.080 --> 57:39.582
Goodness!

57:39.748 --> 57:40.920
It's not funny.

57:41.083 --> 57:42.175
Sorry.

57:42.334 --> 57:46.714
That last chili dog is really barking.

57:46.880 --> 57:48.097
Yes.

57:48.256 --> 57:51.135
It's not perfect timing, I must say.

57:54.012 --> 57:56.185
Don't panic. We'll be
in the city in 20 minutes.

57:56.348 --> 57:59.568
I don't have 20 seconds!
I feel like I swallowed a cruise missile.

57:59.726 --> 58:02.570
Listen, if you've got to go, go.

58:02.729 --> 58:06.404
What...? What am I?
5 years old? This is my car!

58:06.566 --> 58:09.410
- It's only a Volvo.
- Well, people just don't go in Volvos!

58:09.569 --> 58:11.947
- I'll buy you another Volvo.
- No!

58:12.114 --> 58:14.742
That'll be the only thing you'll ever
remember about me.

58:14.908 --> 58:17.957
I'll be the woman who went
on the front seat!

58:18.120 --> 58:20.589
That would be hard to forget.

58:25.460 --> 58:28.088
Okay, I have an idea.
See that RV?

58:29.256 --> 58:31.384
- Yes.
- That is our target.

58:31.758 --> 58:33.760
Can you make it?
Therein lies your salvation.

58:33.927 --> 58:35.645
- No.
- Yes, it's an excellent idea.

58:35.804 --> 58:37.852
- It's unclean!
- It's a brain wave.

58:38.015 --> 58:39.312
- I can hold it!
- Out!

58:39.474 --> 58:45.026
I can hold it! George,
I'm holding it! I'm fine, I can hold it!

58:45.439 --> 58:51.162
No! No, no, George, I don't want...
I'm not going. I'm holding!

58:51.987 --> 58:53.580
Come on.

58:54.656 --> 58:57.535
Hi there!

59:08.170 --> 59:10.514
- You all right?
- Yes.

59:11.798 --> 59:12.845
- Okay?
- I'm good.

59:13.008 --> 59:15.352
- You all right?
- I'm good.

59:15.510 --> 59:16.853
- What?
- My ankle.

59:17.012 --> 59:20.482
No! No, no!
Oh, God! No!

59:22.976 --> 59:24.444
Hi, there!

59:26.813 --> 59:28.656
Oh, God!

59:31.318 --> 59:32.911
Sorry to bother you.

59:33.070 --> 59:36.495
I'm not insane, but my friend needs
to use a bathroom. It's an emergency.

59:36.656 --> 59:38.658
- I'll give you $100.
- A thousand!

59:38.825 --> 59:39.997
Okay.

59:40.160 --> 59:41.662
Thanks. Very sweet of you.

59:41.828 --> 59:43.671
Thank you.

01:00:16.071 --> 01:00:18.745
Clean, clean, clean.

01:00:19.699 --> 01:00:20.791
Where are you guys from?

01:00:21.368 --> 01:00:25.839
Well, Kentucky originally,
but now this is pretty much home.

01:00:25.997 --> 01:00:27.544
Uh-huh.

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:33.046
Come here, babies.

01:00:33.213 --> 01:00:34.840
Hurry!

01:00:35.006 --> 01:00:36.178
Oh.

01:00:36.925 --> 01:00:40.270
What kind of mileage do you get
out of this thing? It's an RV, right?

01:00:40.428 --> 01:00:42.931
A recreational vehicle?

01:00:43.390 --> 01:00:45.768
Traffic's moving

01:00:45.934 --> 01:00:48.528
Hold it! Hold it! Hold it!
Hold it one sec!

01:00:48.687 --> 01:00:50.564
Honey, how are you?
Are you nearly ready?

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:53.609
- Kill me!
- Yeah.

01:00:53.775 --> 01:00:56.745
Oh, um... Oh.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:01.662
Look at that poor jerk.

01:01:01.825 --> 01:01:03.668
Yes, poor jerk.

01:01:03.827 --> 01:01:07.457
Whoa, Nelly.

01:01:12.794 --> 01:01:14.762
George, where's the car?

01:01:14.921 --> 01:01:16.764
I'm sure it's been safely
towed by now.

01:01:16.923 --> 01:01:19.301
Oh, God!
George, George, George!

01:01:19.467 --> 01:01:23.688
Don't worry, don't worry! In many ways,
it was the perfect end to the day.

01:01:23.847 --> 01:01:25.975
Except for those poor
children in the trailer.

01:01:26.141 --> 01:01:28.109
They actually looked
quite frightened.

01:01:29.978 --> 01:01:31.821
Don't worry,
I won't tell anyone.

01:01:31.980 --> 01:01:36.110
Once it's published in the company
newsletter, there'd be no point.

01:01:37.319 --> 01:01:40.789
All right, I'll call for a lift.

01:01:42.157 --> 01:01:44.626
Would you like to have
your nails done?

01:01:44.826 --> 01:01:46.669
A Hollywood tan, perhaps?

01:02:34.834 --> 01:02:38.008
God, it is such a beautiful city.

01:02:38.463 --> 01:02:40.636
My favorite building
of all time. Look.

01:02:40.840 --> 01:02:43.639
Nirosta steel, sunburst tower,
gleaming gargoyles...

01:02:43.802 --> 01:02:46.476
all designed by a man
called William Van Alen...

01:02:46.638 --> 01:02:48.857
obsessed with beating
his former partner...

01:02:49.015 --> 01:02:52.110
who was building the
Bank of Manhattan tower at 927 feet.

01:02:52.269 --> 01:02:56.194
So Van Alen announced
the Chrysler Building at 925 feet...

01:02:56.356 --> 01:03:00.406
and then surreptitiously assembled
the 180-foot mast inside the tower...

01:03:00.568 --> 01:03:03.538
and revealed it after the bank
tower had been completed...

01:03:03.697 --> 01:03:06.371
giving Van Alen the tallest
building for three months...

01:03:06.533 --> 01:03:09.161
until of course...
- Until the Empire State Building.

01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:18.337
All right, please give me the name
of Van Alen's former partner.

01:03:19.754 --> 01:03:22.553
Who is H. Craig Severance?

01:03:24.259 --> 01:03:30.392
- I find you annoying.
- Yes, I'm sure you do.

01:03:32.642 --> 01:03:36.647
But it is pretty amazing what dreams
and lots of money can do, isn't it?

01:03:37.397 --> 01:03:38.944
Yes, it is.

01:03:39.524 --> 01:03:43.449
- You know you're part of that, George.
- Yes, I am.

01:03:43.737 --> 01:03:47.583
All you have to do is use your
power for good instead of evil.

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:50.539
If only I would.

01:03:53.038 --> 01:03:54.631
Listen...

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:58.670
I'm very sorry that these last couple
of months have been unbearable for you.

01:03:59.252 --> 01:04:02.381
Not at all.
Unbearable would have been bearable.

01:04:02.547 --> 01:04:06.802
Then I suppose it's a good thing
that your two weeks are almost up.

01:04:07.719 --> 01:04:09.266
This is it.

01:04:09.429 --> 01:04:12.729
I'll do the Children's League benefit.
I'll make sure June is set up.

01:04:12.891 --> 01:04:15.189
I'll look at your speech
for the groundbreaking...

01:04:15.352 --> 01:04:17.400
and I'll be out of
your life forever.

01:04:17.729 --> 01:04:19.527
Great.

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:21.691
Super.

01:04:42.462 --> 01:04:45.716
- Hi.
- Hey, hey.

01:04:46.341 --> 01:04:49.811
- I have tennis elbow from the other day.
- Oh, yes?

01:04:49.969 --> 01:04:52.761
Lucy has tennis forehead.
Much worse.

01:04:52.787 --> 01:04:56.092
Oh, no. I still feel
terrible about that.

01:04:56.434 --> 01:04:58.482
- Thank God she looks okay.
- Hmm.

01:04:58.645 --> 01:05:01.819
Especially with that big benefit
you're all going to tonight.

01:05:01.981 --> 01:05:04.404
- What was it again?
- It's a benefit...

01:05:04.567 --> 01:05:07.821
for the New York Children's League.
Lucy makes us give money...

01:05:07.987 --> 01:05:10.866
to help society and get a tax break.
Brilliant.

01:05:11.032 --> 01:05:13.330
- Sounds exciting.
- It would be almost impossible...

01:05:13.493 --> 01:05:17.999
to tell you how boring it is. Largely
because it would be too boring.

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:24.297
Well, boring to you might be scintillating
for a girl from Plainview, Wisconsin.

01:05:24.462 --> 01:05:25.839
See you later.

01:05:26.005 --> 01:05:27.803
What about, if you're not busy...

01:05:28.174 --> 01:05:31.519
a bunch of us are going,
do you want to come and be bored?

01:05:32.846 --> 01:05:35.349
- I'd love to.
- All right.

01:05:36.850 --> 01:05:39.774
- All right. See you later.
- Okay.

01:05:45.984 --> 01:05:48.203
Oh, good. These need to go
to Accounting.

01:05:48.361 --> 01:05:50.955
- The loan forms need to be notarized.
- I got it.

01:05:51.114 --> 01:05:54.960
- Here's the Zoning Commission reports.
- Now you can start with the appraisals...

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:57.212
Actually, I don't know
how much time I have.

01:05:57.370 --> 01:06:00.374
George sort of asked me to go
to the benefit with him tonight.

01:06:01.166 --> 01:06:04.340
Oh. Great.

01:06:04.502 --> 01:06:08.177
I just have to figure out what to wear.
I don't have anything.

01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:13.474
- "I don't have anything."
- God, she's nice.

01:06:17.557 --> 01:06:19.901
They're very good muffins.
They just need more fat.

01:06:20.059 --> 01:06:22.608
George, sign these
or we default on five different loans.

01:06:22.770 --> 01:06:24.568
- Take care.
- Hang on. Hang on.

01:06:24.731 --> 01:06:27.075
- I need to go over my speech.
- Sorry. I gotta run.

01:06:27.233 --> 01:06:29.782
We'll pick you up at eight
and go through it in the car.

01:06:29.944 --> 01:06:31.912
I asked June to come.
Hope that's all right.

01:06:32.071 --> 01:06:35.166
Oh, that's dandy, but I don't need
a ride. Thanks.

01:06:41.915 --> 01:06:43.508
- Howard.
- George...

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:46.010
<i>I just received new estimates
on Island Towers.</i>

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:47.887
<i>Costs are skyrocketing.</i>

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:50.924
<i>It will be cheaper to just knock down
the community center.</i>

01:06:51.090 --> 01:06:52.558
What are you talking about?

01:06:52.717 --> 01:06:54.811
We got the job because we said
we'd keep it.

01:06:54.969 --> 01:06:57.688
<i>- We said we intended to keep the center.</i>
- Wait. You can't...

01:06:57.847 --> 01:07:00.225
This is nonsense.
You can't just decide unilaterally.

01:07:00.391 --> 01:07:01.688
- I'm coming over.
- George.

01:07:01.851 --> 01:07:05.321
<i>I want to take a nap before the benefit.
It's all very simple.</i>

01:07:05.855 --> 01:07:07.983
Why can't we build
over the center?

01:07:08.149 --> 01:07:10.368
<i>Because it will eat away our profits.</i>

01:07:10.527 --> 01:07:13.531
<i>There's to be a groundbreaking
ceremony at Coney Island...</i>

01:07:13.696 --> 01:07:15.448
<i>with our friend Assemblyman Perez.</i>

01:07:15.615 --> 01:07:18.118
<i>All I need
is one of your charming speeches.</i>

01:07:18.284 --> 01:07:19.911
You're not gonna get one.

01:07:20.245 --> 01:07:21.542
I need you there.

01:07:21.704 --> 01:07:24.833
- I have to consult my schedule.
- No, you won't. It's your job.

01:07:24.999 --> 01:07:28.799
You're the public face of the company.
They don't want to see me.

01:07:28.962 --> 01:07:32.011
I can't for the life of me think why not.
You're magnificent.

01:07:33.007 --> 01:07:36.181
Look, whatever we lose on this deal,
I'm in for half.

01:07:36.344 --> 01:07:38.642
You'll be in for nothing
at the rate you're going.

01:07:38.805 --> 01:07:43.106
Expensive divorces, poolside parties
at the hotel for 1000 people...

01:07:43.268 --> 01:07:46.738
including fireworks
and a performance by Sting.

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:48.443
That was one special night.

01:07:48.606 --> 01:07:52.531
It was Wendy the concierge's farewell
bash and a good party if I say so myself.

01:07:53.319 --> 01:07:56.619
Look, I know you don't have a clue,
but the economy is not what it was.

01:07:59.158 --> 01:08:02.503
Everything we've got,
all of it, could go.

01:08:02.704 --> 01:08:04.877
Faster than you can imagine.

01:08:05.832 --> 01:08:08.551
We need this built.

01:08:09.335 --> 01:08:12.214
You're our closer and you will
help me close this deal...

01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:15.884
or I will fire you
and take all your stock options.

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:19.350
And I can't bear to see you like that,
George.

01:08:19.511 --> 01:08:22.435
You will help me close this deal,
George, won't you?

01:08:24.725 --> 01:08:26.603
I'm surprised you have to ask.

01:08:27.478 --> 01:08:29.947
I wasn't really asking.

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:35.866
- You should have gone with George.
- Well, he asked June.

01:08:36.029 --> 01:08:40.455
- Not exclusively. He asked you too.
- He asked me too?

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:43.712
How many women should a man
take to dinner? Maybe in Utah.

01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:46.749
- So you're gonna go alone?
- Sure, why not?

01:08:47.081 --> 01:08:48.924
Hey, I think it's great.

01:08:49.082 --> 01:08:51.676
I was always too scared
to go anywhere alone.

01:08:51.836 --> 01:08:56.716
Then I got married.
Now I'll never be alone again.

01:09:12.357 --> 01:09:16.328
Check out this situation.
You two kids have fun.

01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:18.830
All right. Ah-ha.

01:09:19.072 --> 01:09:22.622
Howard.
Helen, how are you?

01:09:22.783 --> 01:09:25.037
Mr. and Mrs. Wade, good evening.

01:09:27.913 --> 01:09:29.461
- I hate these things.
- Ridiculous.

01:09:29.624 --> 01:09:32.002
Why can't we just give the money
and be done with it?

01:09:32.335 --> 01:09:34.383
Yes, that'd be fun.
Who wants a drink?

01:09:34.545 --> 01:09:36.639
- I'd love champagne.
- We don't want anything.

01:09:36.798 --> 01:09:38.800
- I'll have a Scotch.
- Great.

01:09:38.966 --> 01:09:42.015
I'll be right back
with one of the promotional bottles.

01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:47.104
- Wade.
- Trump.

01:09:47.308 --> 01:09:51.063
- I hear Kelson finally dumped you.
- Not exactly, no.

01:09:51.229 --> 01:09:54.608
We came to an understanding that she
couldn't bear me for another second.

01:09:54.774 --> 01:09:56.151
Who's the new chief counsel?

01:09:56.317 --> 01:09:59.036
If she's any good,
I'm gonna steal her away.

01:09:59.529 --> 01:10:01.702
I doubt it. She seems
quite loyal to me.

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:04.287
- Let me be the judge of that.
- All right.

01:10:04.450 --> 01:10:06.794
I'm not intimidated.
I'll even lead you to her.

01:10:06.953 --> 01:10:09.297
She's over there somewhere.

01:11:17.356 --> 01:11:19.358
Good evening.

01:11:19.859 --> 01:11:21.702
Good evening.

01:11:24.197 --> 01:11:25.915
Well, you look... I...

01:11:26.365 --> 01:11:28.709
I... You...

01:11:28.868 --> 01:11:32.714
- I can't wait to hear your speech.
- Yeah.

01:11:33.164 --> 01:11:35.587
No, it's just you look absolutely...

01:11:36.876 --> 01:11:38.173
surprising.

01:11:39.295 --> 01:11:43.175
Well, you haven't seen
the whole outfit yet.

01:11:47.053 --> 01:11:50.899
You see, ordinarily that would
suit you extremely well, but...

01:11:56.103 --> 01:11:58.231
Well, tonight you're...

01:12:01.025 --> 01:12:02.777
I'm just...

01:12:07.448 --> 01:12:09.246
- Lucy, hey.
- Hi.

01:12:09.408 --> 01:12:13.458
- Wow. I love your dress.
- Thank you.

01:12:13.621 --> 01:12:17.251
- And you look very beautiful.
- No.

01:12:20.002 --> 01:12:24.178
- I'm sorry, was I interrupting something?
- No, no. We were just...

01:12:26.592 --> 01:12:28.014
going over my speech.

01:12:29.178 --> 01:12:32.182
Right. Work, work, work.

01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:35.064
Howard wants me to revise
the Island Towers proposal...

01:12:35.226 --> 01:12:37.320
now that we're tearing
down the center.

01:12:37.562 --> 01:12:42.284
- I could really use your help with that.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:12:44.986 --> 01:12:47.114
George, can I please
talk to you for a second?

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:51.285
Hang on. They're about to shoot a man
out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream.

01:12:51.450 --> 01:12:53.123
George.

01:12:58.541 --> 01:13:01.590
I know, but I spent
half the night arguing with Howard.

01:13:01.752 --> 01:13:03.174
I don't care about Howard.

01:13:03.337 --> 01:13:05.931
I care about you, your word
and the community center.

01:13:06.841 --> 01:13:09.936
No community center.
I see. Okay.

01:13:11.637 --> 01:13:16.108
Look, it's not the end of the world,
and we do give millions to charities.

01:13:16.267 --> 01:13:19.146
- Your charities, actually.
- So that justifies lying.

01:13:19.312 --> 01:13:22.612
Since when is helping people and
telling the truth mutually exclusive?

01:13:22.773 --> 01:13:24.867
- You promised me.
- Oh, here we go.

01:13:25.026 --> 01:13:27.996
You said you needed me to tell you
when you were being a schmuck.

01:13:28.154 --> 01:13:31.624
It's frankly none of your business,
is it? You don't work here anymore!

01:13:31.782 --> 01:13:34.877
I cannot believe you won't even try
to be the person you could be.

01:13:35.036 --> 01:13:36.663
- This is the person I could be.
- No.

01:13:36.829 --> 01:13:39.833
You think you're second-rate
and there's nothing you can do.

01:13:39.999 --> 01:13:43.629
And I never believed it
until right now. This minute.

01:13:44.337 --> 01:13:47.432
This is the first time in a year
that I really don't like you.

01:13:49.508 --> 01:13:53.138
I haven't liked me for longer than that.
And I'm not crazy about you right now.

01:13:53.304 --> 01:13:55.853
Why don't you go and be the person
you're supposed to be.

01:13:56.474 --> 01:13:59.523
Oh, good. I see the mature part
of the evening has begun.

01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:01.904
Oh, buzz off, bozo.

01:14:02.688 --> 01:14:06.568
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the ice cream is ready.</i>

01:14:06.734 --> 01:14:09.613
<i>Here comes the topping.</i>

01:14:18.955 --> 01:14:22.880
George, thanks again.
This was a spectacular evening.

01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:24.294
Huh.

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:27.634
I can't wait to tell
my family who I met.

01:14:27.797 --> 01:14:29.925
Why?
Who did you meet?

01:14:30.091 --> 01:14:33.345
- You.
- Ah.

01:14:35.221 --> 01:14:37.269
- What?
- The elevator.

01:14:37.431 --> 01:14:38.899
Oh.

01:14:41.519 --> 01:14:42.566
- Evening.
- Evening.

01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:45.026
- Evening.
- Hi.

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:53.581
- How's your room, by the way?
- Amazing.

01:14:53.739 --> 01:15:00.042
- I want to pay you back with interest.
- Don't be daft. I don't need interest.

01:15:03.040 --> 01:15:05.509
- Well, this is me.
- Hmm.

01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:08.554
So good night.

01:15:08.713 --> 01:15:10.590
- Yeah, good night.
- Um...

01:15:11.799 --> 01:15:17.647
- I had a wonderful time.
- Good. I'm very glad about that.

01:15:20.266 --> 01:15:22.644
So good night.

01:15:25.062 --> 01:15:27.064
Yes, good night.

01:15:40.161 --> 01:15:46.919
It's all right. I own the hotel.
Your breakfast is complimentary.

01:15:58.012 --> 01:15:59.685
Gorgeous.

01:16:00.639 --> 01:16:06.897
I know it's weird living in a hotel but
it somehow has a very homey feel.

01:16:07.813 --> 01:16:10.316
Would you like something
from the minibar?

01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:12.701
Maybe a beer.

01:16:12.943 --> 01:16:14.616
Right.

01:16:22.787 --> 01:16:27.588
Wow, chess.
I love chess.

01:16:29.376 --> 01:16:31.595
You know what I love
even more than chess?

01:16:33.964 --> 01:16:35.216
Pokémon?

01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:37.768
Strip chess.

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:42.102
Yes, that is a very good game.

01:16:52.358 --> 01:16:54.781
George? We need to finish
this conversation...

01:16:54.944 --> 01:16:58.039
- Lucy.
- Oh, June. Hi.

01:16:58.197 --> 01:17:02.168
- Lucy, hi.
- Wow. Wow. Great sup.

01:17:02.326 --> 01:17:05.876
- That's a great dress.
- Oh, you know, same one as before.

01:17:06.038 --> 01:17:09.793
All right. Break's over.
I'm gonna capture your bish...

01:17:12.211 --> 01:17:13.633
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:23.688
We were just playing a little chess.

01:17:27.351 --> 01:17:28.898
And doing some laundry.

01:17:29.061 --> 01:17:30.984
Oh, well, that's okay.

01:17:31.147 --> 01:17:34.617
'Cause I was just about to go off
and have some sex myself.

01:17:34.775 --> 01:17:36.869
I mean, not by myself...

01:17:37.027 --> 01:17:41.533
but with somebody.
Somebody else.

01:17:42.283 --> 01:17:45.253
Oh, you don't know him.
He's in my apartment.

01:17:45.411 --> 01:17:47.379
Yeah, in my bed.

01:17:49.206 --> 01:17:51.584
His name is Barry.
Yeah.

01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:54.845
Barry in my bed.
Okay, bye.

01:17:59.341 --> 01:18:01.560
That was embarrassing.

01:18:35.419 --> 01:18:36.966
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:18:37.129 --> 01:18:39.882
- What's wrong?
- Thanks for your shoes.

01:18:40.049 --> 01:18:43.804
Hold on, lady. Look at me.
What happened?

01:18:43.969 --> 01:18:46.472
- Nothing.
- Something happened.

01:18:46.639 --> 01:18:50.143
I've known you since Brownies,
I've never seen you cry.

01:18:50.309 --> 01:18:52.858
Except when Bush won.

01:18:53.646 --> 01:18:55.648
Which Bush?

01:18:55.814 --> 01:19:01.036
- Both of them. So maybe you cried twice.
- This is a different George.

01:19:01.195 --> 01:19:02.868
I'm sorry.

01:19:03.030 --> 01:19:05.704
It's not supposed to be like this.

01:19:06.867 --> 01:19:08.335
Maybe it is.

01:19:09.495 --> 01:19:13.841
Maybe it's like the philosopher
Sri Yogananda says:

01:19:13.999 --> 01:19:19.631
"Only that which is the other,
gives us fully unto ourselves."

01:19:21.048 --> 01:19:25.224
Look. I had to fight for Tom.
It was the best thing I ever did.

01:19:25.386 --> 01:19:26.478
Really?

01:19:27.346 --> 01:19:29.644
Everything okay?

01:19:29.807 --> 01:19:35.814
- Not now. Everything is not about you!
- Okay.

01:19:57.835 --> 01:20:01.135
Quiet, everyone.
Quiet down, please.

01:20:01.297 --> 01:20:03.015
Thank you.

01:20:03.549 --> 01:20:09.101
I have a little poem I wrote for you,
Lucy. If you could just come up here.

01:20:09.722 --> 01:20:11.395
Please.

01:20:11.557 --> 01:20:12.934
Okay.

01:20:19.523 --> 01:20:22.447
- You ready for this?
- Rhyme away.

01:20:24.987 --> 01:20:27.490
<i>A rolling stone gathers no moss</i>

01:20:28.073 --> 01:20:29.416
So

01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:34.080
<i>You're leaving
With your antacids and floss</i>

01:20:34.413 --> 01:20:39.635
<i>Our hair perhaps we will toss
But we are at a loss</i>

01:20:39.793 --> 01:20:45.266
<i>Because you are the
world's best boss</i>

01:20:54.933 --> 01:20:57.356
Well, that was a very nice speech
you just made...

01:20:57.519 --> 01:21:03.902
and I'm going to really miss
everyone here at Wade.

01:21:05.027 --> 01:21:08.452
There are a million memories
I wouldn't trade...

01:21:08.614 --> 01:21:15.042
and if you ever get accused of
murder, you can find me at Legal Aid.

01:21:19.583 --> 01:21:20.247
What was that?

01:21:20.273 --> 01:21:22.452
Well, it was the same
thing you just did.

01:21:22.586 --> 01:21:26.216
Bye. Bye. Thank you.
Thank you very much. Nice...

01:21:26.382 --> 01:21:27.554
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:21:27.716 --> 01:21:29.810
I'll really miss
your comprehensive reports.

01:21:29.968 --> 01:21:31.686
Me too. Me too.

01:21:31.845 --> 01:21:34.974
Lucy. Thank you so much
for everything.

01:21:35.140 --> 01:21:37.768
No problem.
Well, good luck with everything.

01:21:37.935 --> 01:21:40.905
And I'm sorry about last night.
That was awkward.

01:21:41.146 --> 01:21:46.152
- Oh, not at all. Brian was unbelievable.
- I thought it was Barry.

01:21:47.319 --> 01:21:52.200
Well, Barry was first, and then
it was Brian, and it was just crowded.

01:21:53.826 --> 01:21:56.500
- I almost forgot my stapler.
- Is that...? Oh, God.

01:21:56.662 --> 01:21:58.630
- What?
- Never mind.

01:21:58.789 --> 01:22:01.542
- No, no. What?
- Well, it's just that technically...

01:22:01.708 --> 01:22:05.679
the stapler belongs to the company.
- That's right.

01:22:05.838 --> 01:22:07.761
But... No, you know what?
Whatever.

01:22:07.923 --> 01:22:11.143
It's... The stapler just goes
way back with me. And I...

01:22:11.301 --> 01:22:13.929
Well, no, no. You keep it.
It'll be our little secret.

01:22:14.096 --> 01:22:15.313
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:22:15.472 --> 01:22:18.351
Oh. Great, thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:22:18.517 --> 01:22:20.019
I have kind of earned it...

01:22:20.185 --> 01:22:22.813
working here 18 hours a day,
seven days a week.

01:22:22.980 --> 01:22:24.072
- Wow.
- Yeah.

01:22:24.314 --> 01:22:26.032
Guess that makes you a workaholic.

01:22:26.191 --> 01:22:28.910
No, actually, those are the hours
when you work with George.

01:22:29.069 --> 01:22:32.039
Well, no. I mean,
I can be a workaholic too.

01:22:32.197 --> 01:22:36.873
That's why I'm vigilant about separating
my personal and professional life.

01:22:37.035 --> 01:22:41.415
Really? Well, I guess that would explain
the late-night meeting in your slip.

01:22:41.582 --> 01:22:44.176
- I'm sorry?
- What?

01:22:44.334 --> 01:22:46.382
That is absolutely
none of your business.

01:22:46.545 --> 01:22:48.422
My God. Fine.
How much does a stapler run?

01:22:48.589 --> 01:22:50.341
Here, here's $10.

01:22:50.507 --> 01:22:51.975
- Ridiculous.
- It's not yours.

01:22:52.134 --> 01:22:54.478
What's the matter with you?
Give me my stapler.

01:22:54.636 --> 01:22:56.104
- Look.
- You didn't pay for it.

01:22:56.263 --> 01:23:00.393
- Give me... You have more of these!
- It's not your... Oh, my God.

01:23:01.602 --> 01:23:03.775
- No. No.
- All we're missing is the mud.

01:23:03.937 --> 01:23:06.110
- All right. Enough. Enough. Leave.
- Ow!

01:23:06.273 --> 01:23:08.696
- She's hurting me!
- Leave, leave. Off, off.

01:23:08.859 --> 01:23:10.577
In here.

01:23:10.736 --> 01:23:12.784
<i>You are dead!</i>

01:23:15.782 --> 01:23:18.581
- What was that?
- She wouldn't give me my stapler.

01:23:18.744 --> 01:23:20.858
Part of a new office
supply strip search.

01:23:20.884 --> 01:23:21.739
Your stapler?

01:23:21.872 --> 01:23:24.091
Are you still knocking down
the community center?

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.593
Listen.

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:30.931
- I know you're upset about last night.
- Still knocking down the center?

01:23:31.089 --> 01:23:34.434
- I've been trying to call you...
- Still knocking down the center?

01:23:34.593 --> 01:23:38.223
What is wrong with you? Are you
incapable of talking about your own life?

01:23:38.388 --> 01:23:40.436
Still knocking down
the community center?

01:23:40.599 --> 01:23:44.900
All right. Let me remind you.
You came to the hotel.

01:23:45.062 --> 01:23:47.485
I was with June.
We were unusually dressed.

01:23:47.648 --> 01:23:50.151
You must...
You must have some feelings.

01:23:57.199 --> 01:23:59.952
- I don't have to listen to this.
- God, this is ridiculous.

01:24:00.702 --> 01:24:03.706
You know what, where do you come off?

01:24:03.956 --> 01:24:07.460
Where do you come off? Believe it,
I didn't take this job to sleep with you.

01:24:07.626 --> 01:24:10.425
- I took this job for a cause.
- You are a cause!

01:24:10.587 --> 01:24:12.681
You make Gandhi
look like a used-car salesman.

01:24:12.839 --> 01:24:16.343
My God. You know what I can't believe?
How easy you are being on yourself.

01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:20.981
Why don't we go over this again, okay?
You promised me a community center.

01:24:21.139 --> 01:24:23.767
Yes! I promised, I promised,
I promised. I'm sorry.

01:24:23.934 --> 01:24:26.562
I can't control the economy.
I can't control my brother.

01:24:26.728 --> 01:24:30.153
I did promise, and I did let you down.
I'm sorry. You know what? I'm human.

01:24:30.315 --> 01:24:32.943
- I think you'll find a lot of people are!
- I'm human too!

01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:35.784
Well, are you? Because
you're too perfect, too wonderful.

01:24:35.946 --> 01:24:38.290
None of us can keep up.
That's probably why...

01:24:38.448 --> 01:24:42.373
all those other guys bolted as fast
as their Birkenstocks could carry them.

01:24:42.536 --> 01:24:45.460
'Cause you're intolerable
and no one wants to be preached to!

01:24:45.622 --> 01:24:48.717
No one wants to live with a saint.
Saints are boring.

01:24:59.011 --> 01:25:01.810
Mr. Wade, your brother
wants to see you.

01:25:04.057 --> 01:25:05.684
Right.

01:25:18.822 --> 01:25:21.575
Hi, Mr. Wong?

01:25:21.742 --> 01:25:25.997
Yes, Lucy Kelson.
Yeah, it's been a long time, huh?

01:25:26.163 --> 01:25:28.040
I'm back at my parents' house.

01:25:28.206 --> 01:25:32.302
It's kind of fun being in my old
bedroom and in the neighb...

01:25:32.544 --> 01:25:37.892
Sorry.
Can I have two number sixes...

01:25:38.050 --> 01:25:41.975
and a number, a number 12?

01:25:42.137 --> 01:25:44.310
Yes, that's for one.

01:25:44.473 --> 01:25:46.771
Always for one.

01:25:46.933 --> 01:25:48.731
Yes. That's it. No.
You know what...

01:25:48.894 --> 01:25:53.616
just throw in a couple egg rolls
and that would be great.

01:25:58.570 --> 01:26:04.623
For years, Coney Island has been
trying to attract this kind of development.

01:26:04.785 --> 01:26:06.037
Yeah. Right.

01:26:06.203 --> 01:26:10.834
Hopefully, Island Towers
is the start of big things to come.

01:26:10.999 --> 01:26:13.627
And now, it is my honor
to introduce to you...

01:26:13.919 --> 01:26:19.176
one of the men who made this
all possible, George Wade.

01:26:20.092 --> 01:26:23.767
- You look great.
- Go and earn your money, George.

01:26:28.934 --> 01:26:31.938
- Thanks so much.
- Great.

01:26:32.104 --> 01:26:35.404
Thank you very much,
Assemblyman Perez.

01:26:37.109 --> 01:26:39.077
Your mom is teaching today...

01:26:39.236 --> 01:26:42.206
so we'd better grab a bite
to eat and be on our way.

01:26:42.364 --> 01:26:45.459
We have some protesting to do
at the community center.

01:26:45.617 --> 01:26:47.540
I'm not going.

01:26:47.744 --> 01:26:50.042
- What are you talking about?
- I cannot watch...

01:26:50.205 --> 01:26:52.003
another building
get knocked down.

01:26:52.165 --> 01:26:55.920
Hey. We didn't raise you
to sit on the sidelines.

01:26:56.086 --> 01:26:59.431
Ever since you were a little girl,
you fought for what you believed in.

01:26:59.589 --> 01:27:02.183
You were on the White House
Enemies list at 5.

01:27:02.342 --> 01:27:05.391
Dad, I'm not sitting on the sidelines.
I'm going to work.

01:27:05.554 --> 01:27:07.682
What's the point?
The man's not listen to me.

01:27:07.848 --> 01:27:11.569
Besides, you know, he said
some things to me that were just so...

01:27:14.646 --> 01:27:16.023
True.

01:27:16.440 --> 01:27:19.489
Then you change your tactics,
you change your argument.

01:27:19.651 --> 01:27:20.948
You don't give up.

01:27:21.111 --> 01:27:26.163
We didn't give up on civil rights
or equality for women or fair housing.

01:27:26.533 --> 01:27:28.206
- Honey.
- Hmm.

01:27:28.618 --> 01:27:32.339
As long as people can change,
the world can change.

01:27:32.622 --> 01:27:35.171
Yeah, but what if people can't change?

01:27:35.709 --> 01:27:37.256
Hmm.

01:27:39.463 --> 01:27:41.090
Well...

01:27:41.256 --> 01:27:43.304
let me put it this way.

01:27:44.134 --> 01:27:48.184
I'm sitting here eating a piece
of cheesecake made entirely of soy.

01:27:48.513 --> 01:27:49.981
And I hate it.

01:27:51.016 --> 01:27:53.110
But I'm eating it.

01:28:00.692 --> 01:28:04.697
I'm going to work.
Bye. Good luck.

01:28:12.370 --> 01:28:13.963
The law is clear on this.

01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:17.592
If the landlord has not kept up proper
maintenance, he cannot evict you.

01:28:17.751 --> 01:28:19.094
We will help you, Mrs. Muñez.

01:28:19.252 --> 01:28:23.257
Let me run and get you some forms
you can fill out, and we'll get started.

01:28:36.353 --> 01:28:38.105
Well, hello.

01:28:38.396 --> 01:28:41.570
- Hi.
- You don't remember me, do you?

01:28:41.733 --> 01:28:45.783
Polly St. Clair? You interviewed me?
You thought I was having a baby?

01:28:45.946 --> 01:28:49.291
Oh, yes.
Yes, Polly. Wow.

01:28:49.449 --> 01:28:50.996
- So you work here now.
- Uh-huh.

01:28:51.159 --> 01:28:54.413
- Terrific. How are you?
- Pregnant.

01:28:54.663 --> 01:28:58.133
- I'm not falling for that one again.
- No, I'm really pregnant.

01:28:58.291 --> 01:29:01.215
- You can congratulate me now.
- Polly, I was not born yesterday.

01:29:01.378 --> 01:29:03.676
I'm pregnant!
You want to see the damn sonogram?

01:29:03.839 --> 01:29:05.762
Mrs. Muñez,
we have two other cases...

01:29:05.924 --> 01:29:07.517
Hi.

01:29:10.637 --> 01:29:13.356
Hi. I'm busy.

01:29:13.932 --> 01:29:15.775
Yes.

01:29:16.059 --> 01:29:18.983
I need your advice
on one last thing...

01:29:19.145 --> 01:29:21.614
and I promise you will
never hear from me again.

01:29:21.773 --> 01:29:25.323
I just delivered the first speech written
entirely by myself since we met...

01:29:25.485 --> 01:29:31.618
and I think I may have blown it,
so I wanted to ask your thoughts.

01:29:31.783 --> 01:29:34.787
Okay.
Then I will read it to you.

01:29:34.953 --> 01:29:37.206
"I'd like to welcome everyone
on this special day.

01:29:37.372 --> 01:29:39.966
Island Towers will bring prestige
to the neighborhood...

01:29:40.125 --> 01:29:41.968
and be part of
Brooklyn's renaissance.

01:29:42.127 --> 01:29:44.380
And we're very pleased
and proud to be here.

01:29:44.546 --> 01:29:47.265
Unfortunately,
there is one fly in the ointment.

01:29:47.424 --> 01:29:49.222
You see, I gave my word to someone...

01:29:49.384 --> 01:29:52.354
that we wouldn't knock down
this building behind me.

01:29:52.512 --> 01:29:56.062
Normally, and those who know me or
were married to me can attest to this...

01:29:56.224 --> 01:30:00.229
my word wouldn't mean very much.
So why does it this time?

01:30:00.395 --> 01:30:03.274
Well, partly because this building
is an architectural gem...

01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:05.568
and deserves to be landmarked.

01:30:05.734 --> 01:30:11.582
Partly because people do need a place
to do senior's water ballet and CPR.

01:30:11.740 --> 01:30:13.993
Preferably not together.

01:30:15.076 --> 01:30:20.333
But mainly because this person,
despite being unusually stubborn...

01:30:20.498 --> 01:30:26.926
and unwilling to compromise
and a very poor dresser, is...

01:30:28.048 --> 01:30:29.925
She's...

01:30:31.009 --> 01:30:34.855
rather like the building
she loves so much.

01:30:35.013 --> 01:30:39.564
A little rough around the edges,
but when you look closely...

01:30:40.477 --> 01:30:42.320
absolutely beautiful.

01:30:45.023 --> 01:30:47.697
And the only one of her kind.

01:30:52.197 --> 01:30:55.918
And even though I've said cruel things
and driven her away...

01:30:56.242 --> 01:30:58.586
she's become the voice in my head.

01:31:00.789 --> 01:31:03.508
And I can't seem to drown her out.

01:31:06.711 --> 01:31:09.555
And I don't want to drown her out.

01:31:13.385 --> 01:31:16.935
So we are going to keep
the community center.

01:31:19.140 --> 01:31:22.019
Because I gave my word to her...

01:31:24.729 --> 01:31:27.778
and because we gave our word
to the community."

01:31:31.611 --> 01:31:33.739
And I didn't sleep with June.

01:31:35.448 --> 01:31:38.793
That's not in the speech, that's me
letting you know that important fact.

01:31:38.952 --> 01:31:39.999
Okay.

01:31:43.415 --> 01:31:44.837
What do you think?

01:31:54.592 --> 01:31:56.936
I have to get back to work.

01:32:05.687 --> 01:32:07.189
Right.

01:32:07.397 --> 01:32:10.947
Right, yes, yes, yes.
Sorry to disturb.

01:32:16.906 --> 01:32:18.408
Congratulations again, Polly.

01:32:44.851 --> 01:32:49.106
Aside from the split infinitive
that was somewhere in the middle...

01:32:50.273 --> 01:32:53.152
that speech was actually
quite perfect, wasn't it?

01:32:53.318 --> 01:32:57.243
Yeah. I don't know what the hell
you're still doing sitting here.

01:32:57.405 --> 01:32:59.783
And I don't even like him.

01:33:18.468 --> 01:33:20.186
George!

01:33:32.107 --> 01:33:33.484
Oh.

01:33:42.784 --> 01:33:47.585
George, I just want
to say thank you.

01:33:48.039 --> 01:33:50.542
Thank you and I know
I can be harsh and demanding...

01:33:50.708 --> 01:33:53.803
but I want to try and change
because I believe people can change.

01:33:53.962 --> 01:33:58.058
I can change and not be so demanding
and, you know, like, meet you halfway.

01:33:58.216 --> 01:34:01.311
I just... I know... Things just...

01:34:02.595 --> 01:34:04.393
Once I...

01:34:07.267 --> 01:34:08.439
Lucy...

01:34:09.227 --> 01:34:11.605
I am in love with you.

01:34:14.232 --> 01:34:16.576
And I'm in love with you.

01:34:24.576 --> 01:34:26.874
Oh, I should just mention
that I have resigned...

01:34:27.370 --> 01:34:29.748
and am now poor.
- Good.

01:34:29.914 --> 01:34:34.420
When I say poor, I mean we may have to
share a helicopter with another family.

01:34:34.586 --> 01:34:36.259
Does that work for you?

01:34:36.421 --> 01:34:40.051
As long as I don't have to
work for you, we will be fine.

01:34:40.216 --> 01:34:41.843
Excellent.

01:34:43.011 --> 01:34:46.891
And now I would very much like to discuss
that whole bobcat-pretzel thing.

01:34:47.140 --> 01:34:50.895
Oh, I was just kidding.
I'm allergic to bobcats, actually.

01:34:51.144 --> 01:34:52.566
I'm very sorry to hear that.

01:34:53.479 --> 01:34:57.734
- But I can do the pretzel.
- That's excellent news.

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:41.152
Hi, Mr. Wong,
it's Lucy Kelson.

01:35:41.319 --> 01:35:45.995
I need one number 13,
two number sevens...

01:35:46.157 --> 01:35:48.831
I can't believe how small
this apartment is. It's shocking.

01:35:48.993 --> 01:35:54.500
I need three number
eights, no garlic.

01:35:54.666 --> 01:35:57.636
It's good your parents went to
the movies. We'd never fit.

01:35:57.794 --> 01:36:03.096
I need one number seven and...

01:36:03.258 --> 01:36:06.728
I can walk from one side of this
apartment to the other in six seconds.

01:36:06.886 --> 01:36:12.188
- Watch this. One...
- And a number 11, please.

01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:14.819
No, actually this is for two.
