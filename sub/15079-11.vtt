26:29.588 --> 26:31.420
HE'S YOUNG,
HE'S GOOD-LOOKING,

26:31.420 --> 26:32.632
HE'S PLAYING
PROFESSIONAL BASEBALL.

26:32.632 --> 26:34.093
HIS LIFE'S PERFECT.

26:34.093 --> 26:36.265
LOOK, IT'S NOT ALL PUPPIES
AND SUNSHINE, YOU KNOW.

26:36.265 --> 26:38.517
WHEN I FINALLY
MADE IT TO THE BIGS,

26:38.517 --> 26:40.519
EVERYONE TURNED INTO
MY BEST PAL OVERNIGHT.

26:40.519 --> 26:41.931
AND THERE WAS
A LOT OF BUMS,

26:41.931 --> 26:44.143
FISHING FOR INSIDE DOPE,
PLAYING ANGLES.

26:44.143 --> 26:47.356
BUT ALL THAT NOISE FADED AWAY
ONCE I GOT TO THE PARK.

26:47.356 --> 26:49.188
YOU KNOW YOU -- [ SNIFFS ]
YOU SMELL THE GRASS

26:49.188 --> 26:50.189
AND YOU HEAR THE CROWD.

26:50.189 --> 26:52.031
I-I GET A BANG OUT OF IT

26:52.031 --> 26:53.863
AS MUCH AS I DID
WHEN I FIRST COME UP.

26:53.863 --> 26:56.235
NOW, I'M NOT SAYING THAT
I'M SOME HOLY JOE OR ANYTHING,

26:56.235 --> 26:58.447
BUT AT THAT MOMENT,

26:58.447 --> 27:00.409
YOU REALIZE THAT YOU'RE NOT
ALONE IN THIS WORLD.

27:01.871 --> 27:03.873
IT'S A DREAM COME TRUE.

27:03.873 --> 27:06.706
AND ONCE YOU GET
A TASTE FOR IT,

27:06.706 --> 27:10.800
YOU'LL DO DARN NEAR ANYTHING
TO KEEP THE DREAM ALIVE.

27:12.672 --> 27:16.676
MICAH GETS TO LIVE THE DREAM,
BUT HENRY DOESN'T.

27:16.676 --> 27:18.427
NO WONDER
HENRY KILLED HENRY.

27:19.889 --> 27:22.311
"HENRY KILLED HENRY."

27:24.063 --> 27:26.896
ANDRE.

27:26.896 --> 27:28.107
IT'S DANIEL.

27:28.107 --> 27:29.568
TELL ME,
THE NIGHT OF THE ACCIDENT,

27:29.568 --> 27:33.983
AT THE RAIL YARD,
HOW MANY HENRYS DID YOU SEE?

27:33.983 --> 27:36.155
TWO.

27:44.333 --> 27:46.335
ANDRE SAW TWO HENRYS
AT THE RAIL YARD THAT NIGHT.

27:46.335 --> 27:47.787
EXPLAIN THAT TO ME.

27:47.787 --> 27:49.378
OKAY, AFTER HE SAW
THAT THE TRACKS WERE CLEAR,

27:49.378 --> 27:51.210
HE CLIMBS UP INTO THE CAB,
HE STARTS DRIVING IT.

27:51.210 --> 27:52.631
THAT'S WHEN
HE SEES "HENRY"

27:52.631 --> 27:54.423
THROW A BODY
IN FRONT OF THE TRAIN.

27:54.423 --> 27:57.056
SO, H-HE CAN'T -- HE CAN'T STOP
IN TIME. HE RUNS OVER IT.

27:57.056 --> 27:58.467
WHEN HE COMES DOWN TO SEE
WHAT HAD HAD HAPPENED,

27:58.467 --> 28:00.429
THE BODY IS ALSO HENRY.

28:00.429 --> 28:02.852
AND WHY DIDN'T ANDRE
TELL US THIS BEFORE?

28:02.852 --> 28:04.393
FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE,
HE DID.

28:04.393 --> 28:06.605
WHEN I INTERVIEWED HIM,
HE KEPT REPEATING THE PHRASE,

28:06.605 --> 28:08.107
"KILLED HENRY,
KILLED HENRY."

28:08.107 --> 28:09.729
I THOUGHT -- I THOUGHT HE MEANT
HE KILLED HENRY,

28:09.729 --> 28:10.940
BUT WHAT HE WAS REALLY
TRYING TO SAY WAS

28:10.940 --> 28:12.311
"HENRY KILLED HENRY."

28:12.311 --> 28:13.402
WELL, HE MUST HAVE
EVENTUALLY REALIZED

28:13.402 --> 28:15.024
THAT WE MISUNDERSTOOD HIM,

28:15.024 --> 28:16.816
SO HOW COME HE NEVER
CORRECTED US?

28:16.816 --> 28:19.819
HIS COMMUNICATION WITH OTHERS
IS VERY LITERAL.

28:19.819 --> 28:21.370
WE JUST DIDN'T ASK HIM
THE RIGHT QUESTIONS.

28:21.370 --> 28:24.583
RIGHT.
SO YOU'RE SAYING
THAT MICAH CONLEY,

28:24.583 --> 28:27.246
THIS BLUE-CHIP PROSPECT,
COMES TO CHICAGO FOR SURGERY,

28:27.246 --> 28:29.628
FINDS OUT HE'S GOT
A LONG-LOST TWIN,

28:29.628 --> 28:31.130
AND THEN HE KILLS HIM?

28:31.130 --> 28:33.332
NO. I'M -- I'M SAYING HENRY,
THE SECURITY GUARD,

28:33.332 --> 28:36.175
KILLED MICAH
AND IS NOW IMPERSONATING HIM.

28:36.175 --> 28:37.716
WHY WOULD HENRY
WANT TO KILL MICAH?

28:37.716 --> 28:38.928
BECAUSE MICAH
WAS LIVING THE LIFE

28:38.928 --> 28:40.139
THAT HENRY ALWAYS WANTED.

28:40.139 --> 28:41.390
HENRY WAS BITTER.

28:41.390 --> 28:43.933
HE -- HE OWED MONEY.
HE'D LOST HIS DREAM.

28:43.933 --> 28:46.345
HE HEARS ABOUT MICAH, TRIES TO
CONTACT HIM ON FACEBOOK.

28:46.345 --> 28:47.767
MICAH IGNORES IT
BECAUSE HE FIGURES

28:47.767 --> 28:49.608
HENRY'S JUST
ANOTHER CRAZY FAN.

28:49.608 --> 28:51.440
THEN HENRY,
HE GETS HURT AND OFFENDED

28:51.440 --> 28:52.691
AND THINKS,
"WELL, SCREW HIM!

28:52.691 --> 28:53.853
I'LL -- I'LL --
I'LL TAKE HIS LIFE,"

28:53.853 --> 28:55.314
LITERALLY
AND FIGURATIVELY.

28:55.314 --> 28:56.816
AND THAT TAKES CARE
OF HIS MONEY PROBLEMS,

28:56.816 --> 28:59.859
BECAUSE NOW PAOLO, HIS BOOKIE,
THINKS HE'S DEAD.

28:59.859 --> 29:02.661
MICAH WAS A TOP PROSPECT,
SO HOW THE HELL COULD HENRY

29:02.661 --> 29:04.123
THINK HE COULD
GET AWAY WITH IT?

29:04.123 --> 29:05.494
HENRY WAS
A BASEBALL PLAYER, TOO,

29:05.494 --> 29:07.036
BUT HE SCREWED UP
BEFORE HE GOT HIS SHOT.

29:07.036 --> 29:08.367
SO MAYBE HE --
HE CONVINCED HIMSELF

29:08.367 --> 29:10.499
THAT HE WAS AS GOOD
AS HIS BROTHER.

29:10.499 --> 29:13.042
[ SIGHS ] IS THERE PROOF
OF ANY OF THIS?

29:13.042 --> 29:14.463
WELL, YEAH,
WE HAVE AN EYEWITNESS.

29:14.463 --> 29:16.295
NO OFFENSE,
BUT HIS CONDITION MEANS

29:16.295 --> 29:18.217
HE WOULD BE A DISASTER
ON THE STAND.

29:18.217 --> 29:19.508
YOU SEE, THAT --
BUT...

29:20.800 --> 29:22.641
...IF THERE'S ONE THING
THAT I'VE LEARNED

29:22.641 --> 29:24.183
WORKING WITH
THE TWO OF YOU,

29:24.183 --> 29:27.016
IT'S THAT I SHOULD AT LEAST
ENTERTAIN THE IDEA

29:27.016 --> 29:28.517
THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING
IS TRUE.

29:29.979 --> 29:31.560
SO HOW CAN WE PROVE IT?

29:31.560 --> 29:33.772
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE WE CAN
JUST ORDER A DNA TEST

29:33.772 --> 29:36.235
TO PROVE THAT MICAH
IS REALLY HENRY.

29:36.235 --> 29:38.397
I MEAN, THEY'RE IDENTICAL TWINS.
THEIR DNA's THE SAME.

29:38.397 --> 29:39.658
HEADS UP, DOC.

29:40.359 --> 29:42.531
YOU OKAY?

29:42.531 --> 29:45.995
SORRY, DOC.
THAT ONE GOT AWAY FROM ME.

29:47.406 --> 29:49.038
YOUR HAND. IT'S HEALED.

29:52.331 --> 29:54.713
What are you
talking about?

29:54.713 --> 29:57.917
HIS WRIST. HIS WR--

29:57.917 --> 30:00.339
M-M-MICAH CONLEY
BROKE HIS WRIST IN FLORIDA

30:00.339 --> 30:02.011
BEFORE HE CAME UP
TO CHICAGO.

30:02.011 --> 30:04.633
SO -- SO IF HENRY KILLED HIM
AND IS NOW IMPERSONATING HIM...

30:04.633 --> 30:05.634
HIS WRIST WILL BE FINE.

30:16.105 --> 30:19.738
DEAN HALEY?

30:19.738 --> 30:21.901
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

30:21.901 --> 30:23.903
[ CHUCKLES ]
HI, ELY.

30:23.903 --> 30:25.744
UH...

30:25.744 --> 30:28.747
JUST, YOU KNOW, CAME BY TO SEE
IF YOU MAYBE NEEDED ANYTHING.

30:31.160 --> 30:33.162
ARE YOU SERIOUS?!

30:36.165 --> 30:39.588
YOU WANT ME TO CONVINCE
MY CLIENT

30:39.588 --> 30:41.010
TO GET AN X-RAY

30:41.010 --> 30:43.172
SO HE CAN PROVE
THAT HE'S HIMSELF?

30:44.763 --> 30:46.305
NOT A CHANCE IN HELL.

30:46.305 --> 30:48.727
LOOK...

30:48.727 --> 30:51.931
WHAT IF,
BY SOME CRAZY CHANCE,

30:51.931 --> 30:53.933
IT TURNS OUT THAT HENRY

30:53.933 --> 30:56.355
REALLY IS FOOLING YOU
AND EVERYONE ELSE?

30:56.355 --> 30:57.977
WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO KNOW THAT
BEFORE YOU INVEST

30:57.977 --> 31:00.399
ANY MORE TIME
OR MONEY INTO A KID

31:00.399 --> 31:02.571
WHO ISN'T THE STAR
THAT YOU THINK HE IS?

31:10.289 --> 31:12.331
Joel:
WELL, I'M NO DOCTOR,

31:12.331 --> 31:13.702
BUT THAT LOOKS LIKE
A BROKEN WRIST TO ME.

31:13.702 --> 31:15.544
[ SIGHS ]

31:15.544 --> 31:17.796
THE SCAPHOID IS BROKEN.

31:19.919 --> 31:23.132
THANKS FOR THE COLOSSAL
WASTE OF TIME.

31:23.132 --> 31:26.966
COME ON, MICAH. LET'S GO.
I'LL TAKE YOU BACK TO THE HOTEL.

31:30.719 --> 31:33.933
COULD HENRY HAVE BROKEN
HIS OWN WRIST?

31:33.933 --> 31:37.146
REPLICATING THE SAME TYPE
AND POSITIONING OF THE BREAK

31:37.146 --> 31:39.358
WOULD BE
NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE.

31:39.358 --> 31:41.981
I WAS SO SURE
HE WAS HENRY.

31:41.981 --> 31:44.823
I GUESS WE HAVE TO ACCEPT
THAT WE WERE WRONG.

31:47.326 --> 31:50.289
Mordecai: DID I EVER TELL YOU
WHY MY CURVEBALL

31:50.289 --> 31:51.951
WAS SO UNHITTABLE?

31:51.951 --> 31:53.742
IT WAS UNHITTABLE 'CAUSE
YOU ONLY HAD THREE FINGERS.

31:53.742 --> 31:54.994
THE ABSENCE
OF AN INDEX FINGER

31:54.994 --> 31:56.495
PUT GREATER PRESSURE
BEHIND THE BALL

31:56.495 --> 31:58.667
AT POINT OF RELEASE,
GIVING IT GREATER SPIN.

31:58.667 --> 32:00.669
THE GREATER THE SPIN, THE LESS
DRAG PRESSURE UNDER THE BALL,

32:00.669 --> 32:02.671
FORCING IT
TO DIVE QUICKER.

32:02.671 --> 32:05.094
IT'S SIMPLE PHYSICS.
NOPE.

32:05.094 --> 32:06.385
IT WAS
THE RABBIT'S FOOT.

32:06.385 --> 32:07.676
[ Chuckling ] WHAT?

32:07.676 --> 32:09.348
YEAH, I KEPT IT
IN MY LEFT POCKET.

32:09.348 --> 32:12.351
YOU SEE, I HAD TO PITCH
A DOUBLEHEADER AGAINST BROOKLYN,

32:12.351 --> 32:14.974
AND MY SOUP BONE WAS --
WAS DOG-TIRED

32:14.974 --> 32:16.515
GOING
INTO THE SECOND GAME.

32:16.515 --> 32:19.608
AND MICK, THE TRAINER,
GAVE ME HIS LUCKY RABBIT'S FOOT.

32:19.608 --> 32:22.021
I PITCHED
A ONE-HIT SHUTOUT.

32:22.021 --> 32:24.113
THAT DAY ON, NEVER PITCHED
ANOTHER INNING WITHOUT IT.

32:24.113 --> 32:26.565
WELL, THAT'S JUST
SUPERSTITION AND RITUAL.

32:26.565 --> 32:29.328
BASEBALL'S A GAME
OF SUPERSTITION AND RITUAL.

32:29.328 --> 32:32.781
I KNEW A GUY WHO WOULDN'T CHANGE
HIS SKIVVIES ON ROAD TRIPS.

32:32.781 --> 32:35.204
YEAH, WOULDN'T
SIT NEXT TO HIM ON THE BUS.

32:35.204 --> 32:36.535
AND ANOTHER FELLA --

32:36.535 --> 32:38.497
HE'D SPUN AROUND TWICE
BEFORE HE BATTED.

32:38.497 --> 32:39.708
WHICH HAD ABSOLUTELY
NO BEARING

32:39.708 --> 32:41.130
OR INFLUENCE
ON HIS PERFORMANCE.

32:41.130 --> 32:42.791
LISTEN...

32:42.791 --> 32:45.214
WE BASEBALL PLAYERS
ARE A FUNNY BREED.

32:45.214 --> 32:48.217
WE HAVE TO DO IT
THE SAME WAY EVERY TIME.

32:48.217 --> 32:51.470
OTHERWISE,
WE LOSE THE MAGIC.

32:51.470 --> 32:55.764
YOU HAVE TO DO IT
THE SAME WAY EVERY TIME.

32:55.764 --> 32:58.517
LEWICKI!

32:58.517 --> 33:00.309
WHAT -- WHAT --
WHAT IS IT NOW, DOC?

33:00.309 --> 33:03.732
CALL KATE. TELL HER WE --
WE MAY NOT BE WRONG AFTER ALL.

33:10.369 --> 33:11.610
WHY AM I STILL HERE?

33:11.610 --> 33:12.821
ISN'T THIS HARASSMENT
OR SOMETHING?

33:12.821 --> 33:14.243
THE X-RAY PROVES
I'M NOT HENRY.

33:14.243 --> 33:15.994
Daniel: THAT -- THAT WAS
MY MISTAKE. APOLOGIES.

33:15.994 --> 33:18.617
BUT W-W-WE STILL HAVE TO
FIGURE OUT

33:18.617 --> 33:20.249
WHO ACTUALLY MURDERED
YOUR BROTHER.

33:20.249 --> 33:22.961
YOU DO WANT TO HELP US
CATCH HIS KILLER, DON'T YOU?

33:22.961 --> 33:25.464
YEAH, OF COURSE.
GREAT.

33:25.464 --> 33:26.925
HELP ME U-UNDERSTAND
SOMETHING HERE.

33:26.925 --> 33:28.547
COULD YOU -- COULD YOU
SHOW HIM THAT THING?

33:28.547 --> 33:31.760
YEAH. OKAY.

33:31.760 --> 33:35.134
NOW, THIS IS YOU
AT BAT A MONTH AGO.

33:43.102 --> 33:45.694
AND THIS IS YOU
LAST WEEK IN FLORIDA.

33:55.244 --> 33:57.866
DID YOU NOTICE
ANYTHING?

33:57.866 --> 33:59.618
YEAH.

33:59.618 --> 34:01.039
LITTLE MORE TURN IN MY HIPS,
AND I WOULD HAVE HIT IT OUT.

34:01.039 --> 34:02.871
[ LAUGHS ]
HMM. BAD LUCK.

34:02.871 --> 34:04.713
M-MAYBE -- MAYBE
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE

34:04.713 --> 34:06.715
SWITCHED UP
YOUR ROUTINE.

34:06.715 --> 34:09.718
YOU KNOW, AFTER YOUR WAGGLE,
BEFORE YOUR SET-UP,

34:09.718 --> 34:11.550
YOU ALWAYS TAP
YOUR HELMET.

34:11.550 --> 34:14.343
BUT THIS LAST WEEK IN FLORIDA,
YOU DIDN'T.

34:14.343 --> 34:17.476
YEAH, SO?
WELL, YOU'VE NEVER DONE IT
THAT WAY BEFORE.

34:17.476 --> 34:18.937
IT WAS -- IT WAS STRANGE.

34:18.937 --> 34:21.770
SO WE COMPARED DOZENS
OF YOUR PREVIOUS AT-BATS

34:21.770 --> 34:23.232
TO, UH, TO THIS ONE.

34:23.232 --> 34:25.814
NOW, NORMALLY,
YOU WEAR ONE BATTING GLOVE,

34:25.814 --> 34:27.446
BUT -- BUT HERE
YOU'RE WEARING TWO.

34:27.446 --> 34:30.569
Y-Y-YOU LIKE TO TAKE
THREE WARM-UP SWINGS,

34:30.569 --> 34:31.950
BUT -- BUT THIS TIME,
JUST ONE.

34:31.950 --> 34:33.322
AND YOU ALWAYS
SPIT TO YOUR LEFT.

34:33.322 --> 34:35.864
BUT IN FLORIDA,
IT WAS TO YOUR RIGHT.

34:35.864 --> 34:37.406
SO LAST WEEK, I MIXED IT UP.
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

34:37.406 --> 34:39.538
WELL, BALLPLAYERS ARE A FUNNY
BREED. THEY HAVE RITUALS.

34:39.538 --> 34:42.161
THEY HAVE TO DO IT
THE SAME WAY EVERY TIME,

34:42.161 --> 34:43.832
OR THEY LOSE THE MAGIC.

34:47.256 --> 34:51.089
DID YOU HONESTLY THINK THAT
NOBODY WAS GONNA FIGURE IT OUT?

34:51.089 --> 34:53.382
FIGURE WHAT OUT?

34:53.382 --> 34:56.215
MICAH CONLEY DIDN'T HIT
THAT TRIPLE LAST WEEK.

34:56.215 --> 34:58.267
IT WAS YOU --
HENRY WILMYER.

34:58.267 --> 35:02.060
YOU KILLED MICAH, AND NOW
YOU ARE IMPERSONATING HIM.

35:02.060 --> 35:05.484
THAT'S RIDICULOUS!
YOU GOT LUCKY
ON ONE PITCH, HENRY.

35:05.484 --> 35:07.105
WHAT IN THE WORLD MADE YOU --
MADE YOU THINK

35:07.105 --> 35:08.727
YOU'D -- YOU'D --
YOU'D MAGICALLY BE GOOD ENOUGH

35:08.727 --> 35:09.988
TO PLAY IN THE BIGS?

35:09.988 --> 35:11.280
I MEAN, WHO DO YOU
THINK YOU ARE?

35:11.280 --> 35:12.781
YOU'RE NOT
THE GREAT MICAH CONLEY?

35:12.781 --> 35:15.324
YOU'RE JUST LOWLY
HENRY WILMYER --

35:15.324 --> 35:17.536
POTHEAD, GAMBLER, LOSER.

35:17.536 --> 35:20.118
YOUR SUBPAR SKILLS WOULD
EVENTUALLY GIVE YOU AWAY.

35:20.118 --> 35:23.372
HOW THE HELL DID YOU THINK
YOU'D PULL THIS OFF?

35:23.372 --> 35:26.295
I'M GOOD ENOUGH, DAMN IT!
I HIT THAT BALL!

35:26.295 --> 35:29.168
SO YOU KILLED YOUR BROTHER,
AND YOU TOOK HIS PLACE?

35:29.168 --> 35:32.050
NO. NO, NO, NO. THAT --
THAT'S NOT HOW IT HAPPENED.

35:32.050 --> 35:33.882
YOU MUST HAVE BEEN
SO JEALOUS OF HIM.

35:42.181 --> 35:45.394
I READ THIS ARTICLE
ABOUT MICAH,

35:45.394 --> 35:47.145
AND I-I COULDN'T
BELIEVE IT.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.768
OH, MY GOD.

35:49.768 --> 35:53.192
I-I HAD A TWIN BROTHER
ALL THIS TIME?

35:53.192 --> 35:56.615
SO I-I-I TRIED TO CONTACT HIM,
BUT HE DIDN'T RESPOND.

35:56.615 --> 35:58.987
I FIGURED 'CAUSE HE WAS BUSY,
BUT I COULDN'T JUST LET THAT GO.

35:58.987 --> 36:02.951
I MEAN, THIS AMAZING BASEBALL
PROSPECT MIGHT BE MY TWIN.

36:02.951 --> 36:09.167
SO, I-I-I THOUGHT, IF HE COULD
JUST MEET ME, YOU KNOW?

36:09.167 --> 36:11.380
I MEAN, HE BRAGGED ABOUT
THIS CONDO HE BOUGHT

36:11.380 --> 36:12.921
ON FACEBOOK IN FLORIDA,

36:12.921 --> 36:14.633
SO I-I HOPPED ON A BUS,
AND I-I TRACKED HIM DOWN.

36:16.094 --> 36:19.298
O-OUR FIRST MEET HAPPENED
JUST LIKE I SAID,

36:19.298 --> 36:21.300
ONLY IT HAPPENED IN FLORIDA,
NOT CHICAGO.

36:21.300 --> 36:24.142
BUT WE REALLY DID END UP
HANGING OUT ALL NIGHT.

36:27.185 --> 36:30.229
WHEN DID YOU DECIDE THAT YOU
WERE GONNA TRY TO BECOME HIM?

36:30.229 --> 36:33.732
SWITCHING PLACES
WAS MICAH'S CRAZY IDEA.

36:33.732 --> 36:38.657
WE WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING
REALLY HUNG OVER.

36:38.657 --> 36:41.490
MICAH FELT WORSE THAN ME,
AND HE HAD A GAME TO PLAY.

36:41.490 --> 36:43.872
SO, HE DECIDED TO LET ME

36:43.872 --> 36:48.537
FULFILL MY DREAM
OF PLAYING IN THE PROS.

36:48.537 --> 36:50.629
I MEAN, HE FIGURED IT WAS JUST
FOR ONE MINOR-LEAGUE GAME.

36:50.629 --> 36:52.831
Daniel: HMM.
NO ONE WOULD EVER KNOW.

36:52.831 --> 36:55.504
EXACTLY.

36:55.504 --> 36:57.215
AND I DID IT!

36:57.215 --> 36:58.427
I MEAN, SURE, I-I STRUCK OUT
MY FIRST TWO TIMES AT BAT,

36:58.427 --> 36:59.798
BUT THEN MY TIMING CAME BACK,

36:59.798 --> 37:01.009
AND WHEN THAT CHUMP PITCHER
HUNG A CURVE,

37:01.009 --> 37:02.431
I TAGGED IT, MAN.

37:02.431 --> 37:04.513
AND YOU BROKE YOUR WRIST
SLIDING INTO THIRD.

37:08.937 --> 37:10.769
THE TEAM ARRANGED FOR ME

37:10.769 --> 37:12.771
TO BE FLOWN BACK TO CHICAGO
THE NEXT DAY

37:12.771 --> 37:14.443
FOR SURGERY
WITH THE TEAM'S DOCTOR.

37:14.443 --> 37:15.854
THEY DROPPED ME BACK OFF
AT THE CONDO

37:15.854 --> 37:18.196
TO PICK UP MY STUFF.

37:18.196 --> 37:19.698
MICAH SAW MY WRIST
AND FREAKED,

37:19.698 --> 37:21.159
BUT I-I TOLD HIM
JUST TO CHILL OUT, YOU KNOW?

37:21.159 --> 37:22.571
"I-IT'S ALL GOOD.
EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY."

37:22.571 --> 37:25.284
I COULD JUST BE HIM
UNTIL I GOT BETTER.

37:25.284 --> 37:26.915
MOVE!

37:26.915 --> 37:28.417
THAT'S WHEN
WE STARTED TO FIGHT.

37:34.293 --> 37:38.337
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

37:38.337 --> 37:40.879
SO, YOU DECIDED TO BECOME
MICAH CONLEY PERMANENTLY.

37:40.879 --> 37:43.141
BUT YOU STILL HAD
HIS BODY TO WORRY ABOUT.

37:43.141 --> 37:44.593
I WAS FREAKING OUT.
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

37:44.593 --> 37:46.054
I FIGURED I NEEDED
TO GET BACK TO CHICAGO.

37:46.054 --> 37:48.687
MY ARM FELT LIKE HELL.

37:48.687 --> 37:51.099
I SOMEHOW I GOT HIM INTO
THE TRUNK OF THE MUSTANG,

37:51.099 --> 37:52.391
AND I JUST TOOK OFF.

37:52.391 --> 37:54.313
WASN'T ANYONE LOOKING
FOR MICAH?

37:54.313 --> 37:57.526
I-I-I FOUND HIS AGENT'S NUMBER
IN HIS PHONE.

37:57.526 --> 38:01.530
SO I CALLED AND SAID I DECIDED
TO DRIVE BACK, NOT FLY.

38:01.530 --> 38:04.282
THE CLUB WAS PISSED,
BUT HE SAID HE'D SMOOTH IT OVER.

38:04.282 --> 38:05.494
YEAH, BUT -- BUT -- BUT
TO MAKE THE SWITCH COMPLETE,

38:05.494 --> 38:06.905
YOU HAD TO GET RID OF YOU.

38:06.905 --> 38:08.497
YOU HAD TO KILL OFF
HENRY WILMYER.

38:08.497 --> 38:12.711
WHEN I GOT BACK TO CHICAGO,
I WENT TO MY PLACE.

38:12.711 --> 38:15.083
I SOMEHOW MANAGED TO GET MICAH
INTO MY SECURITY UNIFORM.

38:15.083 --> 38:16.124
I WENT TO THE RAIL YARD.

38:18.377 --> 38:21.179
FIRST TRAIN I SAW MOVING,
I THREW HIS BODY IN FRONT OF IT.

38:24.473 --> 38:27.926
I KNOW IT'S NOT FAIR
WHAT HAPPENED TO MICAH.

38:30.349 --> 38:32.230
BUT I'M THE ONE
THAT SHOULD HAVE MADE IT.

38:34.773 --> 38:36.775
YO, MAXIMUS.

38:36.775 --> 38:38.397
I WANTED TO CATCH YOU
BEFORE WE LEFT.

38:38.397 --> 38:39.818
OH. HEY, ELY.

38:39.818 --> 38:41.239
LOOK, I'M REALLY SORRY
THIS PLACE

38:41.239 --> 38:42.651
WASN'T WHAT YOU HOPED
IT WOULD BE.

38:42.651 --> 38:45.073
KIDDING ME?
CLMU IS AWESOME.

38:45.073 --> 38:47.285
OH, SO YOU'RE GONNA
ENROLL HERE?

38:47.285 --> 38:49.077
HELL, NO.

38:49.077 --> 38:50.499
WHY NOT?

38:50.499 --> 38:53.792
BECAUSE THAT ASSHOLE
BONED MY MOM!

38:53.792 --> 38:56.835
[ LAUGHTER ]

39:02.671 --> 39:04.883
HEY.
DONNIE. HEY.

39:04.883 --> 39:07.726
LISTEN, I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT THE OTHER NIGHT, OKAY?

39:07.726 --> 39:09.728
DON'T -- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
YOU APOLOGIZED ALREADY.

39:09.728 --> 39:13.351
NO, BUT I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT I --
LOOK, LOOK.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.773
OBVIOUSLY, I'M HOPING

39:14.773 --> 39:16.234
THAT YOU WANT TO GIVE US
ANOTHER SHOT.

39:16.234 --> 39:20.068
BUT IF YOU DON'T,
JUST TELL ME.

39:20.068 --> 39:21.860
I'M A BIG BOY.
I CAN HANDLE IT.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.151
DONNIE,
IT'S REALLY NOT LIKE THAT.

39:23.151 --> 39:25.193
I DO WANT TO HAVE
DINNER WITH YOU.

39:25.193 --> 39:29.618
I'M JUST A LITTLE
UNDERWATER HERE.

39:30.789 --> 39:32.621
OKAY.

39:32.621 --> 39:35.253
BUT YOU GOT MY NUMBER.

39:42.761 --> 39:45.173
COME ON, BROWNIE.
THROW IT.

39:45.173 --> 39:47.596
AND DON'T TAKE IT EASY
ON ME.

39:47.596 --> 39:50.559
I WANT TO SEE
THAT VAUNTED CURVEBALL.

39:50.559 --> 39:52.561
ALL RIGHT, DON'T BE FOOLED
WHEN IT LOOKS LIKE

39:52.561 --> 39:54.182
IT'S COMING
RIGHT FOR YOUR HEAD.

39:54.182 --> 39:56.274
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
ENOUGH STALLING. LET'S SEE IT.

39:59.818 --> 40:01.940
[ CAGE RATTLES ]

40:01.940 --> 40:03.782
GREAT --
EVEN WHEN I'M HALLUCINATING,

40:03.782 --> 40:06.324
I CAN'T HIT A CURVEBALL.

40:08.236 --> 40:09.448
YOU EVER WONDERED
IF THERE'S SOMEBODY OUT THERE

40:09.448 --> 40:11.289
EXACTLY LIKE YOU?

40:11.289 --> 40:13.411
A TWIN OR A DOPPELGANGER?

40:13.411 --> 40:15.413
THE WORLD'S ALWAYS BEEN
FASCINATED BY THEM.

40:15.413 --> 40:18.036
IN ANCIENT TIMES,
DOUBLENESS WAS SEEN

40:18.036 --> 40:20.879
AS A MANIFESTATION
OF THE SUPERNATURAL,

40:20.879 --> 40:22.841
AN INVENTION OF THE GODS.

40:22.841 --> 40:25.043
TWINS HAVE BEEN INVALUABLE
IN NEUROSCIENCE

40:25.043 --> 40:27.506
BECAUSE STUDYING THEM
GIVES US INSIGHT

40:27.506 --> 40:30.809
INTO HOW ENVIRONMENTAL BEHAVIOR
AND GENETICS

40:30.809 --> 40:33.221
AFFECT THINGS
LIKE BRAIN AGING OR ADDICTION.

40:33.221 --> 40:36.645
BUT TWIN STORIES TOUCH US
ON A MUCH DEEPER LEVEL.

40:36.645 --> 40:37.726
WHY IS THAT?

40:40.058 --> 40:44.062
ARE WE LOOKING FOR A MORE
PERFECT VERSION OF OURSELVES,

40:44.062 --> 40:47.325
THE PERSON WE WISH WE WERE...

40:47.325 --> 40:50.328
OR SOMEONE TO SHARE
OUR CONSUMING PASSIONS?

40:52.330 --> 40:55.333
MAYBE WE'RE LOOKING
FOR A SOUL MATE,

40:55.333 --> 40:58.707
SOMEONE TO COMPLETE
OUR LIVES.

41:00.288 --> 41:03.922
WHATEVER ITS GENESIS,
THE DESIRE FOR A TWIN

41:03.922 --> 41:06.675
IS AN EXPRESSION
OF OUR NEED TO CONNECT.

41:11.179 --> 41:14.593
BECAUSE IN THIS VAST AND
SOMETIMES OVERWHELMING UNIVERSE,

41:14.593 --> 41:17.225
ONLY OUR RELATIONSHIPS
WITH OTHER PEOPLE

41:17.225 --> 41:20.268
CAN HELP US
NOT TO FEEL SO...

41:20.268 --> 41:22.270
ALONE.
