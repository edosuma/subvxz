WEBVTT

00:01.720 --> 00:03.030
The day of the accident,

00:03.030 --> 00:06.040
I saw Jim's ghost step into Sam's body

00:06.600 --> 00:07.540
You're back!

00:07.600 --> 00:08.770
Do I know you?

00:08.840 --> 00:10.300
I see the same guy that you see.

00:10.370 --> 00:11.455
It's not Jim.

00:11.455 --> 00:13.740
I just know what I see when I look in those eyes,

00:13.800 --> 00:15.400
And Jim is in there somewhere.

00:15.470 --> 00:18.540
That's Dr. Byrd. He's dangerous. Look into the light.

00:18.600 --> 00:20.800
I'll be staying right here, where you live.

00:21.370 --> 00:22.270
I see ghosts.

00:22.340 --> 00:24.240
All right, if this is supposed to be funny,it's not.

00:24.300 --> 00:26.740
If you stop trying, then you're never going to get back what you lost.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.100
Your memories, they're not yours.

00:28.470 --> 00:30.670
- Who am I?  - Jim!

00:30.740 --> 00:32.040
I'm not your husband.

00:32.100 --> 00:34.970
You decided you couldn't accept that your husband is dead,

00:35.040 --> 00:36.700
And so you filled my head with his memories.

00:36.770 --> 00:38.700
I think you should just get your things and leave.

00:38.770 --> 00:40.340
- Melinda...  - Good-bye.

01:06.240 --> 01:07.500
Hi, it's Melinda.

01:07.570 --> 01:08.740
Talk at the beep.

01:08.800 --> 01:10.540
Melinda,hi.

01:10.600 --> 01:14.100
I'm probably the last person you want to hear from right now,

01:14.170 --> 01:15.570
But I kind of...

01:15.640 --> 01:18.300
Well,besides wanting to hear your voice,

01:18.370 --> 01:20.100
I need to ask you a favor.

01:20.170 --> 01:21.670
I think I left something in your garage

01:21.740 --> 01:23.840
And I didn't want to just come by, because...

01:24.940 --> 01:26.840
I don't know if you even want to see me.

01:26.900 --> 01:30.240
So if you could... give me a call,

01:30.300 --> 01:31.600
That'd be...

01:31.670 --> 01:33.270
Thanks.

01:39.300 --> 01:42.070
Is that him again?

01:42.140 --> 01:44.300
You know, Sam says that I have to face the facts,

01:44.370 --> 01:45.840
And he's right.

01:45.900 --> 01:47.670
He's not Jim, and he never will be.

01:47.740 --> 01:49.600
Hey! Don't say that.

01:49.670 --> 01:51.070
You know, if he were,

01:51.140 --> 01:52.900
He would have believed me when I told him the truth.

01:52.970 --> 01:56.800
But instead,he just kept saying "I need more proof,I need more time."

01:56.870 --> 01:58.800
And when I gave him everything,

01:58.870 --> 02:01.170
Even evidence, it was right there in his own head,

02:01.240 --> 02:02.570
He still couldn't.

02:02.640 --> 02:06.340
Look,you may never be able to understand this

02:06.400 --> 02:09.500
Because you've never actually had a choice,

02:09.570 --> 02:13.440
But when you're asked to let go of everything

02:13.500 --> 02:16.400
You've ever believed in, that's not easy.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.840
And you're asking him to let go of himself,

02:18.900 --> 02:20.870
The only self he's ever known.

02:20.940 --> 02:22.540
I'm not asking him anymore,

02:22.600 --> 02:24.700
Because I'm done.

02:24.770 --> 02:26.270
Mel!

02:26.340 --> 02:27.800
You can't give up.

02:27.870 --> 02:31.070
You love him,right? And he loves you.

02:31.170 --> 02:32.640
He may not be the exact man...

02:32.700 --> 02:35.140
I don't think I love him anymore.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.200
What?

02:37.270 --> 02:39.140
What do you mean? It's Jim!

02:39.200 --> 02:40.300
In a way.

02:40.370 --> 02:42.470
Yeah,I guess.

02:42.540 --> 02:44.740
But the Jim that I love,

02:44.800 --> 02:46.240
He had something Sam never will,

02:46.300 --> 02:48.800
And I don't know if it's something I can live without.

02:48.870 --> 02:51.170
What?

02:53.570 --> 02:55.400
Faith.

02:56.870 --> 02:59.770
In me.

02:59.840 --> 03:01.100
Where are you going?

03:01.170 --> 03:02.970
To the store.

03:03.040 --> 03:05.200
You know,there's some things I can do before tomorrow.

03:05.270 --> 03:06.600
You're going to the store at this hour?

03:06.670 --> 03:09.640
Yeah. It's better than going home.

04:34.970 --> 04:37.370
Who are you? How did you get in here?

04:37.440 --> 04:39.870
I don't know.

04:41.970 --> 04:44.440
Oh,I'm sorry. I didn't mean to do that.

04:45.500 --> 04:46.970
I'm calling the police!

05:01.500 --> 05:04.500
The police are on their way!

05:18.770 --> 05:19.640
Dr. Byrd!

05:20.700 --> 05:22.840
What are you doing? Who was that?

05:24.140 --> 05:26.170
There's more where he came from.

05:28.340 --> 05:31.270
How safe do you feel now?

06:10.400 --> 06:11.570
Will you two relax?

06:11.840 --> 06:13.670
Ok,I wasn't in any danger.

06:13.740 --> 06:15.340
Some random guy breaks into the store

06:15.400 --> 06:16.440
And you weren't in any danger?

06:16.500 --> 06:17.840
Ok,he didn't break in,

06:17.900 --> 06:18.970
He came in through the tunnels.

06:19.040 --> 06:20.900
And he was led there by that Dr. Byrd guy.

06:21.270 --> 06:22.270
How can you be so sure?

06:22.340 --> 06:23.540
Because he was confused.

06:23.600 --> 06:24.840
He didn't know where he was.

06:24.900 --> 06:26.470
And if Byrd led him there,

06:26.540 --> 06:28.670
Then he was probably doing that persuasive whispering thing.

06:28.740 --> 06:30.040
You gotta seal up that entrance.

06:30.100 --> 06:32.640
With concrete and steel.

06:32.700 --> 06:34.300
And throw a little led in there. And garlic.

06:34.370 --> 06:36.100
I don't know,whatever else keeps the evil spirits away.

06:36.170 --> 06:37.400
I can't.

06:37.470 --> 06:39.370
There's just too many lost souls still in there.

06:39.440 --> 06:41.100
Yeah,but this was a man.

06:41.170 --> 06:42.670
A real,living person.

06:42.740 --> 06:44.070
What did he want?

06:44.140 --> 06:45.270
And more important, what does Byrd want?

06:45.340 --> 06:46.500
He's ticked!

06:46.570 --> 06:48.800
You crossed his favorite mental patient into the light.

06:48.870 --> 06:50.740
You poached his client.

06:50.800 --> 06:51.970
Did he threaten you?

06:52.040 --> 06:54.070
Byrd said that there was more where he came from,

06:54.140 --> 06:55.800
And did I feel safe now.

06:55.870 --> 06:57.700
See,in danger.

06:57.770 --> 06:59.640
- What is that supposed to mean? - I don't know.

06:59.700 --> 07:01.370
But I do have to find out who this Ben guy is.

07:01.440 --> 07:02.570
Ben?

07:02.640 --> 07:05.200
What,did you exchange business cards?

07:05.270 --> 07:07.540
No,he was wearing a Grandview water and power jumpsuit

07:07.600 --> 07:08.900
With the name "Ben" on it.

07:08.970 --> 07:11.440
Well,that was very handy.

07:11.500 --> 07:14.740
Actually,it is, because it will make it easier for Eli to find him

07:14.800 --> 07:16.200
No,wait,what? Me?

07:16.270 --> 07:18.570
Look, we have to find out why Byrd brought this guy here.

07:18.640 --> 07:19.570
He was one of your colleagues.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.370
Colleague? The guy's dead.

07:21.440 --> 07:22.820
Fine, but he still thinks

07:22.820 --> 07:24.200
that he's practicing psychiatry for some reason.

07:24.270 --> 07:26.670
Yeah, but you're not suggesting I meet with Dr. Byrd.

07:26.740 --> 07:27.826
You're suggesting I meet with the

07:27.826 --> 07:29.240
Tall lunatic who snuck into your basement.

07:29.300 --> 07:31.070
He's not a lunatic.

07:31.140 --> 07:33.300
He was tall.

07:36.640 --> 07:38.470
Ben Tillman?

07:41.040 --> 07:42.870
Yeah. Who are you?

07:42.940 --> 07:44.240
Eli James.

07:44.300 --> 07:46.200
You broke into my friend's store last night.

07:46.270 --> 07:47.740
You kind of scared the hell out of her.

07:47.800 --> 07:51.170
I didn't break in. The door was open.

07:51.240 --> 07:54.740
That begs the question, what were you doing there in the first place?

07:58.300 --> 08:00.640
Well, best I can remember,

08:00.700 --> 08:05.100
I was working in one of the run-off drains by the river,

08:05.170 --> 08:06.500
And all of a sudden, these lights

08:06.570 --> 08:09.070
Started flickering on and off in the tunnels.

08:09.140 --> 08:10.400
So you followed them?

08:11.270 --> 08:11.900
Yeah.

08:11.970 --> 08:14.540
I checked the bulbs.

08:14.600 --> 08:17.640
And then the next thing I knew,I was in that store.

08:17.700 --> 08:19.300
It's ok if you think I'm nuts.

08:19.370 --> 08:20.970
Most people do, including me,

08:21.040 --> 08:23.670
So if you want to press charges, go ahead.

08:23.740 --> 08:26.970
It's probably better for everyone if I was locked up.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.040
I'm a psychologist.

08:29.100 --> 08:30.740
Maybe I can help.

08:30.800 --> 08:33.370
A shrink. No,thanks.

08:33.740 --> 08:34.840
Tried that already.

08:34.900 --> 08:36.270
Tried everything.

08:36.340 --> 08:38.039
Tried everything for what?

08:39.840 --> 08:42.470
My memory is whacked.

08:42.539 --> 08:46.040
Stuff I'm supposed to remember,can't.

08:46.100 --> 08:48.970
Stuff I shouldn't remember,can't help it.

08:49.040 --> 08:51.100
What do you mean, stuff you shouldn't remember?

08:51.170 --> 08:54.000
Stuff that never could have happened to me.

08:54.070 --> 08:57.170
At least according to my ex-wife.

08:57.240 --> 08:59.700
Has it always been like that, or did something happen?

08:59.770 --> 09:01.670
Yeah, something happened.

09:01.740 --> 09:03.570
I died.

09:03.640 --> 09:05.440
How?

09:05.500 --> 09:07.500
Well,they tell me I was at this party 3 years ago,

09:07.570 --> 09:09.570
And the balcony collapsed.

09:09.640 --> 09:12.370
I was technically dead.

09:12.440 --> 09:13.770
But they managed to revive me.

09:13.840 --> 09:15.440
Of course, I don't remember any of it,

09:15.500 --> 09:18.000
Just waking up with absolutely no idea

09:18.000 --> 09:20.500
who I was or how I got there.

09:20.570 --> 09:22.900
I didn't know my family.

09:22.970 --> 09:26.040
My own face in the mirror.

09:26.100 --> 09:29.140
They should have left me dead.

09:30.670 --> 09:32.700
Why are you so interested?

09:32.770 --> 09:33.971
Because I think I know the reason

09:33.971 --> 09:35.500
Why you ended up in my friend's basement.

09:35.570 --> 09:37.340
Listen,this is going to sound crazy...

09:37.400 --> 09:39.370
Wait a minute, I don't want any more crazy,ok?

09:39.440 --> 09:41.040
Now whoever you are,

09:41.100 --> 09:42.270
Just leave me alone.

09:42.340 --> 09:43.700
- I don't want your help,ok?  - Ben...

09:43.770 --> 09:45.340
No,no, leave me alone!

09:45.400 --> 09:47.740
Now I'm sorry I scared your friend,ok?

09:47.800 --> 09:50.300
But maybe she should be scared.

09:50.370 --> 09:53.100
Maybe you should be scared,too.

10:04.300 --> 10:05.770
Melinda,it's me.

10:05.840 --> 10:07.940
You're not going to believe this.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.900
Dr. Byrd?

10:09.970 --> 10:11.500
I know that you can hear me,

10:11.570 --> 10:13.670
And I know about Ben.

10:13.740 --> 10:15.100
You do?

10:15.170 --> 10:17.100
He's a step-in, isn't he?

10:17.470 --> 10:19.470
I'm not familiar with that term.

10:19.480 --> 10:21.810
It's been quite a few years since I've practiced.

10:21.880 --> 10:23.140
You know what I'm talking about.

10:23.910 --> 10:26.040
A ghost that steps into a vacated body.

10:26.110 --> 10:28.610
That's what he is, that's why he's so confused.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.330
You seem to know quite a lot about these step-ins.

10:31.400 --> 10:32.700
You said that there was more.

10:32.760 --> 10:33.800
Did you mean more like Ben?

10:33.860 --> 10:35.000
What do you think I mean?

10:35.060 --> 10:37.030
Don't talk to me like I'm one of your patients.

10:37.100 --> 10:38.260
What do you want from me?

10:38.290 --> 10:41.060
What I always want... I want to help.

10:42.560 --> 10:44.320
Well,I don't want your help.

10:44.390 --> 10:45.660
And leave Ben alone.

10:45.720 --> 10:47.160
Your husband's just gonna get worse,you know.

10:47.220 --> 10:49.720
It's a pattern I've seen many times before,

10:49.790 --> 10:51.520
And it never ends well.

10:51.590 --> 10:54.090
Confusion, amnesia, psychosis,

10:54.160 --> 10:55.690
Destructive rage.

10:55.760 --> 10:59.190
I guess you could say it's the price one pays for cheating death.

10:59.260 --> 11:00.690
Death always wins.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.120
Sam is different. Jim is different.

11:03.190 --> 11:04.890
He's strong, he's remembering.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.660
That's not what you told your friend Delia.

11:06.720 --> 11:09.520
What I told her is that I couldn't help him.

11:09.590 --> 11:11.760
That doesn't mean that he can't be helped.

11:11.820 --> 11:14.420
- He just needs time. - Time is the enemy.

11:14.490 --> 11:17.560
Your husband's been a step-in for what, a month or two?

11:17.620 --> 11:21.320
Ben Tillman's been in the same limbo for 3 years.

11:21.390 --> 11:24.790
I'm sorry to say, he's on the same path as all the rest.

11:24.860 --> 11:27.060
Those souls attack themselves

11:27.120 --> 11:30.090
Until there's nothing left to attack but us.

11:30.160 --> 11:32.060
Then why did you bring Ben to me?

11:32.120 --> 11:34.260
I told you... I want to help.

11:34.320 --> 11:36.790
If you can find a way to save Ben,

11:36.860 --> 11:39.290
Then maybe, just maybe,

11:39.360 --> 11:41.820
There's a chance you could save your husband.

11:47.860 --> 11:49.220
Just what I need.

11:49.290 --> 11:51.290
Detective Blair says Ben has a record.

11:51.360 --> 11:52.890
What did he do?

11:52.960 --> 11:55.360
2 years ago, he beat the crap out of a total stranger,

11:55.420 --> 11:57.290
Some random guy walking into a restaurant.

11:57.360 --> 11:58.490
He's been violent before?

11:58.560 --> 12:00.420
You mean before his brush with death?

12:00.490 --> 12:01.490
No, nothing on record.

12:01.560 --> 12:03.760
Ok, so then assuming that Dr. Byrd was right

12:03.820 --> 12:05.690
And that his spirit is gone

12:05.760 --> 12:06.890
And someone else's soul is in there,

12:06.960 --> 12:08.720
Isn't it possible that the spirit

12:08.790 --> 12:10.760
Could have been violent to being with?

12:10.820 --> 12:13.290
You're basically hoping that some violent psychopath

12:13.360 --> 12:14.990
Took over a good guy's body.

12:15.060 --> 12:16.420
That's something to root for.

12:16.490 --> 12:18.220
Well,it's better than the alternative,

12:18.290 --> 12:20.120
That some good soul is eating itself alive,

12:20.190 --> 12:22.960
And I'm not gonna have that be Jim's punishment for...

12:23.020 --> 12:24.420
Loving you?

12:26.860 --> 12:28.890
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

12:28.960 --> 12:30.320
I...

12:30.390 --> 12:32.390
Ok,um,

12:32.460 --> 12:34.960
Ever since... ever since Jim woke up,

12:35.020 --> 12:36.420
He's been having these flashes of memories,

12:36.490 --> 12:38.060
But if he wasn't talking to somebody like me

12:38.120 --> 12:39.120
who could make sense of them...

12:39.190 --> 12:41.060
People think he's losing his mind.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.990
Right. So who did Ben wake up to?

12:43.060 --> 12:45.690
And what did he say that could give us a clue about who he was?

12:45.760 --> 12:47.560
Or who he really is.

12:48.760 --> 12:50.220
So this is your new place?

12:50.290 --> 12:51.360
Yeah.

12:51.420 --> 12:54.360
Thanks, Ned. Thanks for bringing this.

12:54.420 --> 12:55.360
Sure.

12:55.420 --> 12:57.760
I guess Melinda was busy.

12:59.290 --> 13:00.690
How is she?

13:00.760 --> 13:03.260
Ok, I guess.

13:03.320 --> 13:05.020
She,uh,say anything?

13:05.090 --> 13:08.190
Um,"could you take this to Sam?"

13:10.860 --> 13:12.190
What's that, like your journal or something?

13:12.260 --> 13:13.820
You want a drink? Nothing?

13:13.890 --> 13:15.060
No,I'm fine.

13:15.120 --> 13:16.920
Journal? No,it's,uh,

13:16.990 --> 13:20.090
It's a daily planner. Have a seat.

13:20.160 --> 13:21.390
You ever seen one of these things?

13:21.460 --> 13:24.760
It's kind of like a paper pda.

13:24.820 --> 13:27.660
- Ok. - Here, check that out.

13:28.820 --> 13:31.860
"shower, shave, brush teeth, stove off,

13:31.920 --> 13:33.720
Burners off,all four."

13:33.790 --> 13:35.390
Geez, did you really need this?

13:35.460 --> 13:36.920
As it turns out, I didn't,

13:36.990 --> 13:38.920
But serious amnesiacs do,so...

13:38.990 --> 13:40.290
And everyday I would wake up and I'd wonder

13:40.360 --> 13:42.890
what I'd forgotten from the day before,

13:42.890 --> 13:46.820
so I wrote everything down,

13:46.890 --> 13:50.320
See? Everything. I made these huge lists just to be sure.

13:52.420 --> 13:53.960
- It's funny.  - What?

13:54.020 --> 13:55.790
You see that Carter? You see that name carter?

13:55.860 --> 13:57.490
Ever since I started making that list,

13:57.560 --> 14:00.790
That is the one guy I have no idea who he is.

14:00.860 --> 14:02.990
I thought you said your short-term memory was ok.

14:03.090 --> 14:04.560
It is,it's great.

14:04.620 --> 14:05.800
Carter's not on my phone.

14:05.800 --> 14:07.090
My sister doesn't know who he is.

14:07.100 --> 14:09.590
He's nobody I work with. Who's Carter?

14:11.190 --> 14:12.890
Maybe...

14:12.960 --> 14:14.190
What?

14:14.260 --> 14:16.560
Maybe he's not from, you know,

14:16.620 --> 14:18.890
That life.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.320
Right. It's from Jim.

14:22.390 --> 14:25.860
There's this bike shop in town,called Carter's.

14:25.920 --> 14:28.320
It's small, just for serious cyclists.

14:28.390 --> 14:30.960
And Jim, he was way into riding.

14:31.020 --> 14:33.190
Yeah. It's unbelievable.

14:33.260 --> 14:35.190
- What? - What,did Melinda put this in my head,too?

14:35.260 --> 14:36.760
Did Melinda put Carter in my head?

14:36.820 --> 14:37.990
What do you mean?

14:38.060 --> 14:41.390
Look,I know that you and your mom love Melinda,

14:41.400 --> 14:42.430
And I respect that.

14:42.500 --> 14:44.660
And I also know that you were very close to Jim.

14:44.730 --> 14:46.930
That has nothing to do with it.

14:48.990 --> 14:50.320
I'm not a kid.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.220
I don't believe in the tooth fairy.

14:52.290 --> 14:54.000
But I believe in Melinda,

14:54.000 --> 14:55.620
And what she believes.

14:55.690 --> 14:58.060
Ned, don't you think I want to believe in it, too?

14:58.120 --> 14:59.360
You know?

14:59.420 --> 15:02.190
I mean, how great would that be that you die

15:02.260 --> 15:05.660
And then just step into someone else's life?

15:05.720 --> 15:08.060
Yeah, I want to believe in that.

15:08.120 --> 15:09.590
Except I can't, Ned,

15:09.660 --> 15:12.020
Because it doesn't make any damn sense.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.720
No.

15:16.760 --> 15:19.520
My ex-husband Ben was treated at Providence Care Clinic.

15:19.590 --> 15:21.720
How did you come across his case again?

15:21.790 --> 15:24.490
I was researching a journal on memory loss.

15:24.560 --> 15:26.520
His neurologist was cited.

15:26.590 --> 15:28.890
Well,if you're looking for some insight,

15:28.960 --> 15:31.420
I'm probably the last person who can help you.

15:31.890 --> 15:32.890
Why is that?

15:32.960 --> 15:35.720
Because I don't understand anything that happened.

15:35.990 --> 15:38.190
Losing one's memory completely,

15:38.260 --> 15:40.090
It's maddening.

15:40.160 --> 15:42.820
I watched what it did to him.

15:42.890 --> 15:47.590
I would try and tell him things about who he was, who we were,

15:47.660 --> 15:51.260
And it was like it didn't stick.

15:51.320 --> 15:54.190
It only confused him more.

15:54.260 --> 15:56.260
And...

15:57.520 --> 15:58.690
Go on, Anne.

15:58.760 --> 16:01.060
It was like he didn't want to remember.

16:01.120 --> 16:03.420
Like he was holding on to something else.

16:03.490 --> 16:08.660
Some images that... they never happened.

16:08.720 --> 16:10.090
What kind of images?

16:10.160 --> 16:12.260
Places he thought we'd been.

16:12.320 --> 16:15.290
Songs he wouldn't have liked.

16:16.820 --> 16:18.360
And people's names.

16:18.420 --> 16:22.260
He used to call me Clarissa...

16:22.320 --> 16:26.560
When he was half-asleep or wasn't thinking.

16:26.620 --> 16:31.090
Can you imagine... after twenty years...

16:31.160 --> 16:32.760
So the divorce.

16:32.820 --> 16:34.590
He didn't want to be with me.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.590
After work, he wouldn't come home.

16:36.660 --> 16:38.790
I'd call him on his cell,

16:38.860 --> 16:41.490
And he'd be sitting on the same bus bench.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.290
Night after night.

16:43.360 --> 16:46.160
Like he was waiting for someone.

16:48.390 --> 16:50.960
Maybe he was waiting for her.

17:35.660 --> 17:37.690
Hurry, send the police now!

17:37.760 --> 17:39.320
He is here again.

17:39.390 --> 17:42.090
Oh,my god. Quickly, I don't see him anymore!

17:42.160 --> 17:43.190
He could be at my door!

17:43.260 --> 17:44.720
He could be...

17:48.760 --> 17:50.420
Just give me a chance to talk to her.

17:50.490 --> 17:52.060
No, Eli.

17:52.120 --> 17:54.420
Oh,come on! You can't come and tell me about a crime

17:54.490 --> 17:56.020
If there's nothing I can do about it.

17:56.120 --> 17:57.090
That's just teasing.

17:57.090 --> 17:58.890
I called you because I'm wondering

17:58.960 --> 18:00.960
What you know about this guy Ben Tillman,

18:01.020 --> 18:02.660
Her peeping Tom.

18:02.720 --> 18:05.060
The one who's record you asked me about.

18:05.120 --> 18:06.120
Where is he?

18:06.190 --> 18:07.460
He's in custody, getting his psych exam.

18:07.520 --> 18:09.190
Then he's going into city jail.

18:09.260 --> 18:12.520
Eli, he could be out on bail as soon as tomorrow.

18:12.590 --> 18:13.790
Is he a patient of yours?

18:13.860 --> 18:15.660
Confidential.

18:15.720 --> 18:16.960
See? How does that feel,hmm?

18:17.020 --> 18:18.320
Is he dangerous?

18:23.460 --> 18:25.260
Is he dangerous?

18:25.320 --> 18:27.160
I don't know.

18:27.220 --> 18:29.720
Clarissa. That's her name, isn't it?

18:29.790 --> 18:30.960
I can't tell you that.

18:31.020 --> 18:32.020
That would be a violation of her privacy.

18:32.090 --> 18:33.520
Look, just tell me one thing.

18:33.590 --> 18:35.060
Is she by any chance a widow?

18:35.420 --> 18:37.960
Oh,come on. I could find out online in 5 seconds.

18:38.220 --> 18:39.590
Yeah.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.720
She lost her husband 3 years ago.

18:41.790 --> 18:43.790
And your guy Ben Tillman's been hanging around,

18:43.860 --> 18:45.120
Freaking her out ever since.

18:45.190 --> 18:46.860
Imagine the timing on that.

18:46.920 --> 18:48.960
Yeah,imagine.

18:49.020 --> 18:51.120
Thanks.

18:52.260 --> 18:53.560
Clarissa's husband dies.

18:53.620 --> 18:55.390
Anne Tillman's has a near-death experience

18:55.460 --> 18:57.760
And comes back a different man, her words.

18:57.820 --> 19:00.960
Calling her Clarissa and hanging around his old home.

19:01.020 --> 19:03.690
And get this... the man that Ben randomly attacked?

19:03.760 --> 19:05.920
That was Clarissa's dead husband's business partner.

19:05.990 --> 19:08.660
Ok,so then the attack wasn't random.

19:08.720 --> 19:11.720
It was unfinished business of Joseph's that's driving him.

19:11.790 --> 19:14.360
Or it was something that Byrd put into his head.

19:14.420 --> 19:15.660
Yeah,but where did Dr. Byrd find him?

19:15.720 --> 19:18.560
I mean,was Joseph's spirit drawn to the tunnels?

19:18.620 --> 19:19.760
According to his obituary,

19:19.820 --> 19:23.190
Joseph died of a protracted illness and was treated at a clinic

19:23.260 --> 19:26.590
that was housed in the same building as Byrd's sanatorium.

19:26.660 --> 19:27.760
So Byrd was waiting?

19:27.820 --> 19:29.620
Probably right by his bedside,

19:29.690 --> 19:32.290
Saying "Welcome to the afterlife."

19:33.720 --> 19:35.360
Why the bowels of the town again?

19:35.420 --> 19:37.190
Because ghosts don't always come when they're called.

19:37.260 --> 19:39.820
Why? What does he want?

19:42.590 --> 19:44.790
A wild guess? He was probably trying to scare us.

19:44.860 --> 19:47.260
Or maybe it's because we have nothing to talk about.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.320
You've done nothing to help Joseph.

19:49.390 --> 19:50.560
I thought you wanted to help me.

19:50.620 --> 19:51.960
But I guess Joseph is your patient,

19:52.020 --> 19:53.720
So of course that's who you want to help.

19:53.790 --> 19:55.620
Not true. I wanted to help your husband,too.

19:55.690 --> 19:57.860
Well,then why did you pick Joseph?

19:57.920 --> 20:00.660
I mean,there had to have been others,so why him?

20:00.720 --> 20:03.760
The light held less interest for him.

20:03.820 --> 20:05.190
You know,he was dying.

20:05.260 --> 20:07.360
Is that what helped you get inside his head?

20:07.420 --> 20:08.660
When his doctors gave up on him,

20:08.720 --> 20:11.120
- I was there offering a cure.  - For death.

20:11.190 --> 20:12.860
But you didn't tell him the risks,did you?

20:12.920 --> 20:14.690
There were some things he wanted to do and I helped him.

20:14.760 --> 20:16.620
Like attacking his old business partner?

20:16.690 --> 20:18.620
You're a doctor. Act like one.

20:18.690 --> 20:21.290
You want results? We need the facts.

20:21.360 --> 20:23.220
His partner was profiting from his death at work

20:23.290 --> 20:25.520
- and at home with his wife. - Is that even true?

20:25.590 --> 20:27.520
What does that matter? It helped him.

20:27.590 --> 20:28.860
To get into Ben's body.

20:28.920 --> 20:30.990
Which proved that Joseph's spirit was alive and well,

20:31.060 --> 20:34.260
Even if the combination proved a little unstable.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.860
It's not perfect, but it's working better this time.

20:36.920 --> 20:38.360
This time?

20:38.420 --> 20:40.660
Practice makes perfect.

20:40.720 --> 20:43.860
That's what he's doing. He's practicing,

20:43.920 --> 20:45.790
Until he gets it right.

20:45.860 --> 20:48.060
Those souls... Joseph, Jim,

20:48.120 --> 20:49.360
They're just lab rats to him.

20:49.420 --> 20:51.060
He's using them.

20:51.120 --> 20:53.860
Yeah,because he wants to live again.

20:58.160 --> 20:59.590
It's worrying me that you're not more worried.

20:59.660 --> 21:01.920
Byrd is not going to step into anyone

21:01.990 --> 21:03.690
Until he knows that there's less of a risk.

21:03.760 --> 21:06.060
- How do you know that?  - He's pure evil.

21:06.120 --> 21:08.260
And if pure evil is that bad,

21:08.320 --> 21:11.120
How bad will pure evil be in a brand new meat suit?

21:11.190 --> 21:12.720
What's a meat suit?

21:12.790 --> 21:15.020
And what shrink calls somebody pure evil?

21:15.090 --> 21:17.360
Ok, he's a ghost with issues that we haven't resolved yet.

21:17.420 --> 21:18.920
Ok, yeah, and let's list those issues.

21:18.990 --> 21:22.120
Number one,he's evil. Number two, he's pure evil.

21:22.190 --> 21:23.690
This is Ben's.

21:27.390 --> 21:31.190
Ben? It's Melinda, are you home?

21:35.120 --> 21:36.520
Can you clarify for me

21:36.590 --> 21:38.760
Why we're breaking into someone's apartment

21:38.820 --> 21:41.560
Who did time for beating up a guy?

21:41.620 --> 21:44.320
This is why.

21:47.390 --> 21:50.060
Oh,this guy's got issues.

21:52.390 --> 21:54.690
Wait a minute, we know these names.

21:54.760 --> 21:57.860
They're in Joseph's file. Stanley's the father,

21:57.920 --> 22:01.590
Jessica's the sister, and Galveston, that's where he's from.

22:01.590 --> 22:02.660
What are you doing here?

22:03.920 --> 22:05.360
What are we doing here?

22:05.420 --> 22:07.790
Um...what are we doing here? I don't remember.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.120
We went to see you at work,

22:09.190 --> 22:10.690
And your boss said that you were a no-show.

22:10.760 --> 22:11.960
Didn't even call in sick.

22:12.020 --> 22:14.660
Oh,so now you think you got it figured out?

22:14.720 --> 22:16.320
I flaked out 'cause I'm a nutcase?

22:16.390 --> 22:17.355
No,believe it or not,

22:17.355 --> 22:19.320
we're probably the only two people around here

22:19.390 --> 22:21.090
Who know what's going on in your head.

22:21.360 --> 22:22.860
How's that?

22:22.920 --> 22:25.720
For starters, we know who Stanley is.

22:25.790 --> 22:29.960
And Jessica, and we know why Galveston matters so much.

22:30.020 --> 22:32.690
Would you like us to tell you?

22:34.320 --> 22:37.060
So you're serious?

22:38.960 --> 22:41.878
Well,I must be crazy, because that's the first thing

22:41.878 --> 22:44.190
that's made sense to me since my accident.

22:44.260 --> 22:46.260
So you don't recognize the photo?

22:46.320 --> 22:47.940
Of me? No. No,

22:47.940 --> 22:49.760
but everything else you're saying.

22:49.820 --> 22:52.660
So nothing that I remember is from Ben's life?

22:52.720 --> 22:55.860
Just the memories you've made over the past 3 years.

22:55.920 --> 22:57.860
And my old life, my real life,

22:57.920 --> 22:59.490
Is where all of this comes from?

22:59.560 --> 23:00.890
"c."

23:00.960 --> 23:04.760
Clarissa. Why are so many of these in twos?

23:04.820 --> 23:07.020
I don't know, that's just how I remember it.

23:07.090 --> 23:10.020
Cc, two "cs."

23:10.090 --> 23:12.260
Clarissa Cooper Webb.

23:12.320 --> 23:15.960
Her initials. That's gotta be your nickname for her.

23:16.020 --> 23:18.660
That's it,that's what I called her,cc.

23:18.720 --> 23:21.190
So that's the woman you were watching

23:21.260 --> 23:22.920
Where you were arrested, that's your wife,

23:22.990 --> 23:25.420
Living in the house that you used to live in.

23:25.490 --> 23:29.260
And now she's scared of me.

23:29.320 --> 23:30.960
My own wife.

23:32.020 --> 23:33.320
How am I gonna make her understand?

23:33.390 --> 23:35.790
Why don't you let us do it?

23:35.860 --> 23:38.320
We've done it before, and that way,if there's a bad reaction...

23:38.390 --> 23:40.090
I'll lose her again.

23:42.860 --> 23:44.560
You just have to be patient.

23:44.620 --> 23:48.190
It's a lot for someone to take in all at once.

23:50.690 --> 23:53.090
CC...

24:11.520 --> 24:12.890
Can I help you?

24:12.960 --> 24:15.590
Yeah,um,I found a note to myself

24:15.660 --> 24:17.360
That I was supposed to come pick up something at your store.

24:17.420 --> 24:20.190
And,uh,I have no idea what it was.

24:20.260 --> 24:22.490
Let me check the order book.

24:22.560 --> 24:25.260
- What name? - Sam Lucas.

24:25.320 --> 24:28.420
Sam Lucas...

24:28.490 --> 24:30.290
Nothing here, sorry.

24:30.360 --> 24:31.620
Yeah.

24:31.690 --> 24:33.760
Anything else I can do?

24:33.820 --> 24:36.190
Yeah, actually.

24:36.560 --> 24:38.020
You know, it might have been

24:38.090 --> 24:39.960
Something that belonged to a buddy of mine.

24:40.020 --> 24:41.160
Could you check his name?

24:41.220 --> 24:43.520
What name?

24:43.590 --> 24:45.020
Jim Clancy.

24:45.090 --> 24:46.820
Jim Clancy...

24:48.960 --> 24:51.260
I remember this guy.

24:51.320 --> 24:53.520
He was so excited about this bike.

24:53.590 --> 24:54.920
Yeah?

24:54.990 --> 24:58.590
It was a touring bike, titanium,24 speeds.

24:58.660 --> 25:00.660
Think he was planning on taking his wife on a trip.

25:00.720 --> 25:03.320
You know,one of these tours through wine country.

25:03.390 --> 25:05.720
Yeah. Been ready for weeks.

25:05.790 --> 25:07.390
If you want to pick it up...

25:07.460 --> 25:08.760
No,I should check and see if...

25:08.820 --> 25:10.560
Ah, don't check with his wife.

25:10.920 --> 25:11.920
Why not?

25:11.990 --> 25:13.290
Well, it's a surprise.

25:13.360 --> 25:14.360
The bike is for her.

25:14.420 --> 25:16.720
She doesn't know anything about it.

25:18.120 --> 25:20.390
Right.

25:24.860 --> 25:27.020
Is this a joke?

25:27.090 --> 25:28.460
Did he put you up to this?

25:28.520 --> 25:29.720
Is he here somewhere?

25:29.790 --> 25:32.190
No,of course not. Ben stayed away.

25:32.260 --> 25:35.020
I asked him to until I had the chance to talk to you.

25:35.090 --> 25:37.860
Because what, I'd believe this from you?

25:37.920 --> 25:39.020
Who are you?

25:39.090 --> 25:40.760
What is this even about?

25:40.820 --> 25:42.990
You were married to him.

25:43.060 --> 25:45.520
Whether it's possible or not, I mean,

25:45.590 --> 25:46.340
Wouldn't you want the chance

25:46.340 --> 25:48.090
to talk to your husband again if you could?

25:48.160 --> 25:49.360
No.

25:49.420 --> 25:52.620
And if this guy were actually Joseph, he'd know.

25:52.690 --> 25:54.520
What do you mean?

25:56.020 --> 25:59.320
Joseph cheated on me. I told him I was leaving him.

25:59.390 --> 26:01.740
His partner Craig risked their whole business

26:01.740 --> 26:03.090
to tell me the truth.

26:03.160 --> 26:05.520
Which,thank god, Joseph never found out.

26:05.590 --> 26:07.790
Look,in cases like this,

26:07.860 --> 26:10.190
People sometimes don't remember all the facts,

26:10.260 --> 26:12.320
But they do remember their feelings.

26:12.390 --> 26:15.390
Based on what I saw, Ben...Joseph...

26:15.460 --> 26:17.190
Still really loves you.

26:17.260 --> 26:18.890
So...what?

26:18.960 --> 26:22.690
Some sad, creepy sewer worker thinks he's my husband?

26:22.760 --> 26:24.460
I'm supposed to think that's romantic?

26:24.520 --> 26:26.020
Look,I know that it's really hard to under...

26:29.420 --> 26:32.290
I need to go check something.

26:41.020 --> 26:43.520
No,cc!

26:52.790 --> 26:53.990
Sorry.

26:58.260 --> 27:01.820
Why did I even... I should have stayed dead!

27:30.060 --> 27:32.320
Oh,god.

27:32.390 --> 27:33.360
What the hell am I?

27:33.420 --> 27:36.960
I'm just a ghost of my own worthless life!

27:52.890 --> 27:53.560
Ben?

27:53.620 --> 27:55.190
You don't have much time.

27:55.260 --> 27:56.460
Time for what?

27:56.520 --> 27:59.420
So that you can step into a body and go live life again?

27:59.490 --> 28:01.360
- You're angry with me. - Yeah,you picked up on that?

28:01.420 --> 28:03.960
I don't expect you to understand what I did or why.

28:04.020 --> 28:06.060
Believe me,I'm beginning to wonder about it myself.

28:06.120 --> 28:07.890
But Ben is in trouble, and if someone doesn't help him,

28:07.960 --> 28:11.520
- He's going to die again. - Well,where is he?!

28:16.260 --> 28:17.760
Ben!

28:35.220 --> 28:37.660
Ben?

28:37.720 --> 28:39.020
Ben!

28:42.690 --> 28:44.560
He's in there.

28:44.620 --> 28:45.690
I think he wants to hurt himself.

28:45.760 --> 28:47.260
Ben, can you hear me?

28:47.820 --> 28:49.090
Ben!

28:50.920 --> 28:53.390
Ben! Ben, can you hear me?

28:53.460 --> 28:56.520
Melinda!

28:56.590 --> 29:00.590
Ben! Will you please just go make sure that he's all right?

29:08.390 --> 29:10.390
Keep going, Ben, you're almost safe.

29:15.990 --> 29:18.220
He's ok, but you should leave.

29:18.290 --> 29:20.420
How do I know that you're not lying to me?

29:20.490 --> 29:22.460
How do I know that you're not just going to step into him

29:22.520 --> 29:23.620
The second that he dies?

29:23.690 --> 29:26.490
You don't, but you should leave!

29:28.820 --> 29:30.920
Run!

30:09.960 --> 30:12.760
I'm so sorry. I never intended for any of this...

30:12.770 --> 30:14.740
Just please go and tell Eli where I am!

30:14.810 --> 30:16.170
I wanted to understand. I thought I could help people...

30:16.240 --> 30:17.410
Just go!

30:18.510 --> 30:19.740
Please!

30:23.640 --> 30:25.540
Eli. Look,I need to talk to you.

30:25.610 --> 30:26.470
Now is not a good time.

30:26.540 --> 30:28.170
I know you're friends with Melinda

30:28.240 --> 30:30.340
And you're probably mad at me,but...

30:30.410 --> 30:31.640
I said not now!

30:31.710 --> 30:32.910
You can get to her through a utility vault.

30:32.970 --> 30:34.470
There's a manhole cover up here ahead on the right.

30:34.540 --> 30:37.010
Eli,what's with the crowbar? What's with the tools?

30:37.070 --> 30:38.940
Why can't we get to Melinda from above ground?

30:38.990 --> 30:40.770
The utility vault must have led to the street before,

30:40.840 --> 30:41.910
But it's been sealed off.

30:41.970 --> 30:43.970
What,Melinda... what's wrong with Melinda? What's going on?

30:44.040 --> 30:45.710
She's trapped underground. The water is rising.

30:45.770 --> 30:47.670
What? What water? What are you talking about?

30:47.740 --> 30:48.970
Who are you talking to?

30:49.040 --> 30:50.710
Are you sure you're ready to hear this?

30:53.440 --> 30:54.670
Eli!

30:55.740 --> 30:56.740
A ghost told you this?

30:56.810 --> 30:58.640
One you don't even trust in the first place?

30:58.710 --> 31:01.340
He's making sense, and I'm not taking any chances.

31:01.410 --> 31:02.740
This is where Ben came up

31:02.740 --> 31:04.070
when he heard Melinda's voice calling for him,

31:04.140 --> 31:06.310
But if the water's rising as fast as Byrd says it is...

31:06.370 --> 31:07.440
Byrd, the ghost, that's right.

31:07.510 --> 31:09.040
Ben won't be back in time!

31:09.110 --> 31:10.370
Eli, you know how this sounds!

31:10.380 --> 31:14.270
Reincarnated guys breaking water mains,ghosts sending messages!

31:35.170 --> 31:37.740
What's wrong?

31:37.810 --> 31:40.340
I'm afraid I won't get to her.

31:41.210 --> 31:42.710
I can't really swim.

31:42.770 --> 31:43.870
What?!

31:43.940 --> 31:45.170
Then what are you doing?!

31:45.240 --> 31:46.970
Same thing she'd do for me.

31:47.040 --> 31:49.110
You don't even know if she's down there.

31:49.170 --> 31:50.770
You're risking your life for nothing!

31:50.840 --> 31:53.310
For nothing?! Is that what you think of her?

31:53.370 --> 31:55.640
Is that how afraid you are to take a chance?

32:08.440 --> 32:10.740
Stop. Stop!

32:10.810 --> 32:12.610
You're right.

32:13.440 --> 32:16.070
You're right,Eli.

32:16.140 --> 32:17.410
And I can swim.

32:17.470 --> 32:19.270
Give me this.

32:23.040 --> 32:25.470
Where is she?

32:25.540 --> 32:27.570
Ok,Byrd says you go down through the door here at the bottom,

32:27.640 --> 32:28.810
And you swim maybe 90 feet.

32:28.870 --> 32:31.570
She's in a utility vault, just like this one,ok?

32:31.640 --> 32:35.970
These tools are to break through a locked grate.

32:38.270 --> 32:40.670
90 feet.

32:40.740 --> 32:42.810
And you know all this from a ghost?

32:42.870 --> 32:44.870
That's enough for you?

32:44.940 --> 32:47.870
Sometimes you just have to take a leap of faith.

32:47.940 --> 32:49.940
Ok?

35:45.770 --> 35:47.710
Oh,my god!

35:47.770 --> 35:49.940
Oh,my god!  oh,my god!

35:50.010 --> 35:53.540
Sam! Sam!

35:53.610 --> 35:54.510
Sam!

35:55.070 --> 35:56.210
Sam!

35:57.670 --> 35:58.470
Sam!

35:58.940 --> 35:59.870
Sam!

36:01.370 --> 36:03.470
Melinda, you're safe.

36:04.510 --> 36:06.610
You...you came for me!

36:06.670 --> 36:08.710
Of course I did.

36:08.770 --> 36:11.110
Where are we?

36:13.440 --> 36:16.640
They must have shut off the water, it stopped rising.

36:19.710 --> 36:21.010
Melinda...

36:21.070 --> 36:22.340
What's going on?

36:22.410 --> 36:24.240
It's ok, Sam, you're just confused.

36:24.310 --> 36:25.370
You're gonna be all right

36:25.440 --> 36:27.040
As soon as I can get us out of here.

36:27.110 --> 36:29.570
Why do you keep calling me Sam?

36:30.740 --> 36:32.510
You don't remember.

36:32.570 --> 36:34.810
It's the amnesia, it's ok.

36:34.870 --> 36:37.140
Honey, what amnesia?

36:37.210 --> 36:38.610
What are you talking about?

36:41.370 --> 36:43.710
Then what do you want me to call you?

36:44.770 --> 36:47.070
Well,you can call me by my name.

36:47.140 --> 36:49.410
Just call me Jim.

37:00.270 --> 37:01.670
What?

37:02.670 --> 37:06.070
Just call me Jim, Mel, it's my name.

37:08.610 --> 37:10.610
Jim!

37:10.670 --> 37:13.010
Oh,my god!

37:13.070 --> 37:16.610
Oh, my god, you're back!

37:19.070 --> 37:21.540
You're back!

37:31.670 --> 37:33.140
You all right?

37:33.210 --> 37:34.510
- Right.  - Great.

37:34.570 --> 37:36.340
All right, let's get out of here.

37:41.870 --> 37:43.970
You must be freezing.

37:44.040 --> 37:45.270
Sit.

37:45.340 --> 37:47.640
Ok? And just... I need you to stay here

37:47.710 --> 37:51.170
For just a few minutes. All right?

37:51.240 --> 37:53.370
So cover up.

37:53.440 --> 37:54.770
Don't move. Don't talk to anyone.

37:54.840 --> 37:57.470
Don't call anyone. Don't...

37:57.540 --> 37:58.910
What's going on, Mel?

37:58.970 --> 38:02.170
Uh, nothing. Just trust me, everything's fine.

38:02.240 --> 38:04.270
Is it a ghost thing?

38:05.340 --> 38:06.810
Yeah.

38:06.870 --> 38:09.240
Yeah, you know how weird that can be.

38:09.310 --> 38:12.010
Well,I'm here. I'm a statue.

38:12.070 --> 38:13.670
I love you.

38:14.640 --> 38:17.710
God, I love you so much.

38:17.770 --> 38:19.410
Me,too.

38:21.270 --> 38:24.170
Oh,I feel horrible.

38:24.270 --> 38:27.140
I mean...god, what you went through...

38:27.210 --> 38:28.740
It's ok.

38:28.810 --> 38:30.170
And you tried to get help.

38:30.240 --> 38:31.910
No.

38:31.970 --> 38:33.970
I tried to get even.

38:34.040 --> 38:36.440
That's how this started.

38:36.510 --> 38:38.910
I wanted revenge on my partner.

38:38.970 --> 38:41.870
But that was in another life.

38:41.940 --> 38:45.840
In this life, you helped make a miracle happen.

38:45.910 --> 38:47.640
Thank you.

38:47.710 --> 38:49.010
It's ok.

38:49.070 --> 38:51.410
No, I mean for what you did.

38:51.470 --> 38:53.310
You made sense in my life,

38:53.370 --> 38:56.340
And,uh,it's not the life that I left behind

38:56.410 --> 38:59.770
Or even what I might have chosen.

38:59.840 --> 39:02.910
This is my second chance,

39:02.970 --> 39:05.410
And I'm gonna do better with this than I did the first.

39:09.840 --> 39:11.070
Thank you.

39:12.970 --> 39:14.810
- Bye. - Bye.

39:22.070 --> 39:24.140
What about you?

39:24.210 --> 39:25.970
Seen any lights?

39:26.040 --> 39:30.310
Same ones I've been seeing off and on since the day I died.

39:30.370 --> 39:33.010
Does the light really look that bad?

39:33.070 --> 39:34.470
The truth?

39:34.540 --> 39:35.940
It looked good.

39:36.010 --> 39:39.370
Looked too good.

39:39.440 --> 39:41.510
I'm scared.

39:41.570 --> 39:43.210
Why?

39:44.410 --> 39:47.310
The emotion inside of it.

39:47.370 --> 39:49.640
Everything I'd ever learned taught me

39:49.710 --> 39:52.910
that emotion like that needed to be managed.

39:52.970 --> 39:55.070
Feared, even.

39:55.140 --> 39:57.810
What emotion? Can you describe it?

39:57.870 --> 40:00.010
Do you really have to ask?

40:01.840 --> 40:03.540
Love.

40:03.610 --> 40:06.110
The kind that makes a man risk everything,

40:06.170 --> 40:08.710
Over and over again

40:08.770 --> 40:11.340
For no sensible reason.

40:11.410 --> 40:15.740
The kind that makes sensible reasons...

40:15.810 --> 40:18.470
And even death itself

40:18.540 --> 40:20.810
Mean nothing.

40:20.870 --> 40:24.010
Were you afraid that it would make you mean nothing?

40:24.070 --> 40:27.470
I was just afraid.

40:28.410 --> 40:30.040
And now?

41:06.470 --> 41:07.640
Ok.

41:07.710 --> 41:08.910
Ok.

41:08.970 --> 41:10.910
Mel,I gotta call Sully.

41:10.970 --> 41:13.070
He's gonna be worried that I haven't checked in.

41:13.140 --> 41:16.040
Trust me, Sully's not worried about you.

41:16.110 --> 41:18.470
Why have you made me keep my eyes closed this entire time...

41:18.540 --> 41:21.010
Because it's a surprise.

41:21.070 --> 41:22.340
- A big surprise.  - All right?

41:22.410 --> 41:23.670
Ok.

41:23.740 --> 41:25.170
Ok.

41:25.240 --> 41:28.040
- You ready?  - Yep.

41:28.810 --> 41:30.270
Here it goes.

41:32.170 --> 41:35.140
All right,just... right there.

41:35.210 --> 41:37.070
- Ok.  - Ok?

41:38.740 --> 41:42.310
Do you promise to keep an open mind?

41:42.370 --> 41:45.570
I promise.

41:45.640 --> 41:47.770
I mean we're all born and reborn out of water.

41:47.840 --> 41:50.840
You know, baptized, as it were,from the unconscious depths.

41:50.910 --> 41:51.970
It's...

41:52.040 --> 41:53.210
What do you think happened?

41:53.270 --> 41:54.870
How did he suddenly get all his memories back?

41:54.940 --> 41:57.310
Well,generally,you know, healthy psyches can accommodate

41:57.370 --> 41:59.910
more than one functioning ego at a time,

42:00.070 --> 42:01.540
and if one of those egos perishes,

42:01.540 --> 42:03.510
then another one may come in and take its place,and...

42:03.570 --> 42:06.110
So in other words, you don't have a clue.

42:06.170 --> 42:07.940
None at all.

42:08.010 --> 42:10.740
It's pretty quiet in there. You think she's shown him yet?

42:14.140 --> 42:16.510
What...

42:16.570 --> 42:19.140
What the...

42:20.370 --> 42:23.470
This is my face now?

42:24.810 --> 42:27.370
How did I...

42:29.510 --> 42:32.410
You did it for us.

42:32.470 --> 42:35.510
For me.

42:35.570 --> 42:38.210
And I begged you not to do it, but you wouldn't listen.

42:38.270 --> 42:40.340
I must have been out of my mind.

42:40.410 --> 42:42.170
Yeah. I thought so,too,

42:42.240 --> 42:45.510
Like,kind of one of your worst ideas ever.

42:46.670 --> 42:49.110
Until today.

42:50.940 --> 42:52.770
You still look the same.

42:55.940 --> 42:58.210
That makes me the lucky one.

42:58.270 --> 43:00.940
No, we both are.

43:04.270 --> 43:06.170
Oh,my god!
