WEBVTT

00:13.151 --> 00:15.498
I have always known
exactly what I'm worth.

00:15.532 --> 00:16.809
$1 Million.

00:18.052 --> 00:21.228
2 million! 3 million!

00:21.262 --> 00:25.749
3,245,000.

00:25.784 --> 00:28.511
That's how much I had
to pay to keep you.

00:28.545 --> 00:30.927
And you are worth it.

00:30.961 --> 00:32.308
You are worth all of it.

00:35.552 --> 00:37.554
You know what that means, right?

00:37.589 --> 00:39.418
Means you get to stay here,

00:39.453 --> 00:41.869
means you don't have
to go to your mom's.

00:41.903 --> 00:44.872
Means I get to
see you every day.

00:44.906 --> 00:46.253
Airplanes?

00:46.287 --> 00:47.806
We can do airplanes.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.981
We can build any
airplane you want

00:51.016 --> 00:54.226
because I'm not going
to work today or ever.

00:55.469 --> 00:57.850
It's Christmas and
we're gonna do airplanes

00:57.885 --> 00:59.990
and we're gonna make 'em fly.

01:01.199 --> 01:05.065
$3,245,000.

01:05.099 --> 01:06.307
That's what he paid my mom

01:06.342 --> 01:08.965
for sole custody
after the divorce.

01:08.999 --> 01:12.037
What I didn't know was
he only divorced her.

01:13.211 --> 01:14.867
He didn't divorce the office.

01:14.902 --> 01:16.559
What do you mean he
backed out of the deal?

01:16.593 --> 01:18.975
He doesn't get to
back out of the deal.

01:19.009 --> 01:22.737
He needs to deliver
500,000 novelty armadillos

01:22.772 --> 01:23.945
before New Year's

01:23.980 --> 01:27.225
or I'll see him in court
from now until July.

01:27.259 --> 01:29.986
Oh, he wants to talk
sphincter molds, does he?

01:30.020 --> 01:31.712
I'll tell him about
sphincter molds.

01:31.746 --> 01:33.990
You tell him that I've
been doing sphincter molds

01:34.024 --> 01:35.750
since before he was born.

01:35.785 --> 01:37.235
What can I say?

01:37.269 --> 01:39.133
You can't divorce your mistress.

01:39.168 --> 01:40.065
June!

01:41.273 --> 01:43.033
Stop playing with that stuff.

01:43.068 --> 01:45.484
The semester starts today.

01:45.519 --> 01:48.832
What? No, it's just my kid
and her danged airplanes.

01:51.352 --> 01:53.906
I actually thought 3 million
meant he really loved me.

01:55.598 --> 01:57.807
Now, I think he was
just a bad negotiator.

02:02.950 --> 02:04.434
Here's another
thing I'm sure of,

02:04.469 --> 02:07.023
nothing I do here
matters at all.

02:07.057 --> 02:08.852
My dad's got a dozen companies

02:08.887 --> 02:10.233
and the instant I get a diploma,

02:10.268 --> 02:12.477
he's gonna stick me in a
corner office somewhere

02:12.511 --> 02:14.582
with a thick salary
and that's that.

02:14.617 --> 02:16.584
I'll never have to
worry about a thing.

02:17.482 --> 02:19.863
Not a thing.

02:27.906 --> 02:31.012
Hey, uh, I really
need that back.

02:32.082 --> 02:33.532
Angle of incidence.

02:33.567 --> 02:35.085
Excuse me?

02:35.120 --> 02:37.053
Well, this is an old Wright
Brothers box glider, right?

02:37.087 --> 02:38.296
Mm-hmm.

02:38.330 --> 02:39.089
They used to call
it angle of incidence

02:39.124 --> 02:40.332
but today it's called-

02:40.367 --> 02:41.506
Angle of attack.
Yes, I'm aware.

02:41.540 --> 02:43.818
Um, could you just
give that back? Please-

02:43.853 --> 02:46.890
See if you go over
that, the wing loses lift,

02:46.925 --> 02:48.754
you get loss of
airflow over the wing,

02:48.789 --> 02:50.791
which would lead directly to
an abrupt loss of altitude-

02:50.825 --> 02:52.689
Okay, look, I'm very impressed

02:52.724 --> 02:53.932
that you read
further than I did.

02:53.966 --> 02:56.417
That's, that's awesome.

02:56.452 --> 02:57.832
But that's due in two minutes.

02:57.867 --> 02:59.109
- Okay?
- You know

02:59.144 --> 03:00.490
this can go a lot
farther, right?

03:00.525 --> 03:02.043
I mean, you've really
compromised your lift here.

03:02.078 --> 03:02.872
- But-
- Look, I don't need it

03:02.906 --> 03:03.907
to go farther.

03:03.942 --> 03:06.047
I just need it to go 30 feet.

03:06.082 --> 03:07.014
Just one little
tweak to the wing-

03:07.048 --> 03:09.119
Uh, no. No messing with it.

03:09.154 --> 03:10.811
That is due.

03:10.845 --> 03:12.364
But it could be
so much better.

03:12.399 --> 03:17.300
Look, whoever you
are, I don't care.

03:17.335 --> 03:18.232
Okay?

03:18.267 --> 03:19.785
It's just a grade.

03:19.820 --> 03:21.822
I don't need to go
round the world.

03:23.030 --> 03:24.756
Just need it to pass.

03:24.790 --> 03:26.896
But it's an airplane.

03:26.930 --> 03:29.036
It's just a grade.

03:34.455 --> 03:35.249
Oh, come on.

03:35.284 --> 03:36.181
What are you? Seven?

03:36.216 --> 03:37.458
I gotta get that turned in.

03:37.493 --> 03:38.839
And look, if you wanna
take one home to daddy

03:38.873 --> 03:40.185
and play there, that's fine.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.566
But that one is not a toy.

03:44.154 --> 03:44.948
No, no.

03:44.983 --> 03:46.087
Come on. No.

03:46.122 --> 03:47.296
No. Come on.

03:47.330 --> 03:47.813
Please do not.

03:47.848 --> 03:48.642
Ah! No.

03:48.676 --> 03:49.539
What are you doing?

03:55.373 --> 03:57.444
You better go
get that. It's due.

04:19.051 --> 04:21.122
Is this your project?

04:22.676 --> 04:23.573
You get an A.

04:28.682 --> 04:31.201
You know how some
people are like car problems

04:31.236 --> 04:33.549
or annoying relatives?

04:33.583 --> 04:36.172
They just keep turning up.

04:41.177 --> 04:43.179
You are applying
arbitrary standards

04:43.213 --> 04:45.250
to get your favored
result knowing full well

04:45.285 --> 04:47.839
that comparable risks are
tolerated all the time.

04:47.873 --> 04:51.187
And you are ignoring the
fact that risk is cumulative

04:51.221 --> 04:52.844
and will add up to
unacceptable levels

04:52.878 --> 04:54.086
within that timeframe.

04:54.121 --> 04:55.571
While
you seem to believe

04:55.605 --> 04:56.813
that the organization can
only do one thing right.

04:56.848 --> 04:58.539
And you do not understand

04:58.574 --> 05:00.403
that it is a question
of priorities.

05:00.438 --> 05:01.922
And those are clearly
spelled out in-

05:01.956 --> 05:03.268
Time!

05:03.303 --> 05:05.305
Enough about the seating chart.

05:05.339 --> 05:08.031
Let's move on to
the actual debate.

05:10.758 --> 05:14.072
But then one day,
one wonderful day,

05:14.106 --> 05:19.008
you move on and you'll
never, ever, ever

05:19.042 --> 05:20.941
have to deal with that arrogant,

05:20.975 --> 05:23.392
stuck up, selfish jerk again-

05:45.621 --> 05:46.794
- Hello everyone.
- So?

05:46.829 --> 05:50.039
Welcome to
this year's graduation.

05:50.073 --> 05:51.903
So is not a
five-syllable word.

05:53.974 --> 05:58.427
So. Business?

05:58.461 --> 06:00.221
Really? Business major?

06:03.501 --> 06:05.468
That's kind of surprising.

06:07.159 --> 06:09.369
Didn't know I had to
get your approval for it.

06:10.300 --> 06:11.440
Like, business?

06:11.474 --> 06:12.889
I mean really.

06:12.924 --> 06:15.754
I mean, I, I would've
figured you for aeronautics.

06:15.789 --> 06:19.309
Figuring wrong
seems to be a habit of yours.

06:19.344 --> 06:22.865
Not just aeronautics
though. Like valedictorian.

06:22.899 --> 06:25.488
Or at least with honors, right?

06:28.249 --> 06:29.147
I mean, right?

06:30.631 --> 06:32.357
Even the guy that
forgot his hat can see

06:32.392 --> 06:34.842
that you are way too
smart for business.

06:36.292 --> 06:38.950
Is this your warped way
of giving me a compliment?

06:38.984 --> 06:41.401
Is this your warped
way of receiving one?

06:45.922 --> 06:48.097
Fine. Let's just say it.

06:49.339 --> 06:50.824
You're bone-chillingly smart.

06:52.066 --> 06:54.552
And I did not think for a moment

06:54.586 --> 06:57.865
that it would be for business.

06:59.039 --> 07:00.834
Explain to me

07:00.868 --> 07:03.077
why it's your expectations
I should meet?

07:04.320 --> 07:07.047
Well, then whose
expectations are you meeting?

07:07.081 --> 07:10.291
'Cause if it's not your
own either, then come on.

07:11.396 --> 07:13.709
You're just coasting.

07:13.743 --> 07:16.677
Like an F-16 being
used as a glider.

07:22.062 --> 07:24.271
Are you having some
sleepless nights?

07:24.305 --> 07:26.998
Thinking about all the
places you won't be employed?

07:27.032 --> 07:28.275
Excuse me?

07:28.309 --> 07:31.727
Broadcast, you
majored in broadcast,

07:31.761 --> 07:36.801
not tech, not new media,
broadcast, with honors.

07:37.940 --> 07:39.700
Well, my apologies on
behalf of those of us

07:39.735 --> 07:41.426
who have an actual plan.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.669
Broadcast?

07:42.703 --> 07:45.050
Like big antennas on mountains

07:45.085 --> 07:47.812
and endless reruns
of "Lawrence Welk."

07:47.846 --> 07:50.366
In the age of streaming,
really?

07:50.400 --> 07:52.575
Were the newspapers not
hopeless enough for you?

07:52.610 --> 07:55.785
Oh, what, you're saying
you've never watched TV before?

07:55.820 --> 07:56.959
Honestly, no.

07:56.993 --> 07:58.339
Growing up there
was a big screen

07:58.374 --> 08:00.963
in every room of the
house, all streaming.

08:00.997 --> 08:04.622
That's not even the future.
That's the recent past.

08:04.656 --> 08:05.761
I mean, what do you
think you're gonna do?

08:05.795 --> 08:07.279
Exhume Walter Cronkite?

08:07.314 --> 08:11.076
You know, some
of us have actual ideas.

08:11.111 --> 08:12.284
Yeah.

08:12.319 --> 08:13.838
And some of us have
actual earnings.

08:14.908 --> 08:17.117
Go ahead. Say what you want.

08:17.151 --> 08:19.395
I've had a job since day one.

08:19.429 --> 08:20.983
What do you got lined up?

08:22.709 --> 08:25.470
I've got resumes out.

08:26.713 --> 08:27.645
Lined up.

08:30.371 --> 08:32.097
Well, that's lovely.

08:32.132 --> 08:33.305
You can make the
world a better place

08:33.340 --> 08:36.205
by being unemployed with honors.

08:37.827 --> 08:42.798
Well, wherever
I end up, I'll be flying.

08:44.351 --> 08:45.594
You'll just be coasting.

08:47.527 --> 08:48.735
Happy graduation.

09:17.487 --> 09:18.558
You're what?

09:19.697 --> 09:20.905
I'm not coming
in tomorrow, Dad.

09:20.939 --> 09:22.803
You can't take vacation now.

09:22.838 --> 09:25.185
It's not a vacation. I quit.

09:25.219 --> 09:26.324
You what now?

09:26.358 --> 09:27.843
Quit. Quit.

09:27.877 --> 09:28.844
Q-U-I-T.

09:28.878 --> 09:30.086
Look it up in the dictionary.

09:30.121 --> 09:32.330
Quit is not in our
family vocabulary.

09:32.364 --> 09:35.160
Yeah. Well, maybe you
should learn a new language.

09:35.195 --> 09:36.886
Tell me straight.

09:36.921 --> 09:38.854
Is this about money?

09:38.888 --> 09:41.201
Because if it is, good deal.

09:41.235 --> 09:42.478
We can just add
another zero to your-

09:42.512 --> 09:44.584
Dad, it's really not.

09:44.618 --> 09:46.206
Your mom?

09:46.240 --> 09:48.104
Your mom's been talking to you.

09:48.139 --> 09:50.244
Mom hasn't given me
anything other than postcards

09:50.279 --> 09:52.039
in the last 15 years
and you know it.

09:52.074 --> 09:53.040
Private jet, huh?

09:53.075 --> 09:54.283
I'll get you the key.

09:54.317 --> 09:56.009
Dad, I don't want
anything from you.

09:58.667 --> 10:03.533
I just wanna fly
instead of coasting.

10:03.568 --> 10:04.431
Okay?

10:06.260 --> 10:07.158
Okay.

10:08.677 --> 10:10.368
We're good on this, right?

10:11.231 --> 10:12.853
I mean, we're, we're good?

10:12.888 --> 10:14.648
Oh yeah. Yeah, we're good.

10:15.960 --> 10:17.996
So you got another job?

10:18.031 --> 10:19.480
Uh, yeah. Yeah.

10:19.515 --> 10:23.001
Beachwood & Haggle.
Mid-sized investment place.

10:23.036 --> 10:25.659
I'll be doing the
client outreach thing.

10:25.694 --> 10:27.247
Great.

10:27.281 --> 10:29.111
Good for you and all that.

10:29.145 --> 10:31.009
I know you'll do great.

10:31.044 --> 10:31.941
Yeah.

10:58.934 --> 11:01.591
Come in. Come in.

11:02.972 --> 11:06.562
June, I have good news.
I just sold the company.

11:06.596 --> 11:08.495
You're getting a promotion.

11:08.529 --> 11:09.427
A big one.

11:11.084 --> 11:12.016
I resign.

11:20.369 --> 11:21.266
Kids.

11:22.751 --> 11:23.993
Hi, Mr. Kelgood.

11:24.028 --> 11:26.686
I'm calling about the
client-facing job,

11:26.720 --> 11:28.446
wondering if it's
still available.

12:31.612 --> 12:32.510
What is it?

12:32.544 --> 12:33.856
My name is Allison. This is-

12:38.205 --> 12:39.689
Jeeper's crow, Dad.

12:39.724 --> 12:41.933
Hey, now we made a
lot of people happy today.

12:41.968 --> 12:43.797
Yeah. Well, you sure
didn't make me happy.

12:43.832 --> 12:45.350
Well, maybe
that's your own fault.

12:45.385 --> 12:46.904
You ever think about that?

12:46.938 --> 12:49.216
Just don't. I am not the
one with the problem here.

12:49.251 --> 12:50.770
You are the one
with the problem.

12:50.804 --> 12:52.772
I'm also the
one who's employed

12:52.806 --> 12:55.257
and there's no reason
you couldn't be too.

12:55.291 --> 12:56.465
Don't you dare.

12:56.499 --> 12:58.122
Don't I dare. What?

12:58.156 --> 13:00.227
Don't you dare try
and keep this up.

13:00.262 --> 13:01.539
I will outlast you.

13:01.573 --> 13:03.196
I will find something.

13:03.230 --> 13:04.093
Where?

13:06.199 --> 13:07.856
We can never be bought.

13:08.960 --> 13:11.307
That's right folks.
Nobody owns us.

13:13.171 --> 13:16.450

viewers like you.

13:16.485 --> 13:21.214
Our city's only public
television station since 1969.

13:21.248 --> 13:24.527
Always independent,

13:24.562 --> 13:26.806
We'll always give you our best

13:26.840 --> 13:31.224
because you've always given us
your best, viewers like you.

13:35.021 --> 13:36.505
Sweetheart?

13:36.539 --> 13:37.437
Where?

13:39.508 --> 13:42.856
Just you try and find out.

13:42.891 --> 13:43.926
Wait, what?

14:11.402 --> 14:12.748
Hello?

14:14.750 --> 14:16.441
Hello. Anybody?

14:18.823 --> 14:19.720
Hello?

14:21.446 --> 14:26.520
Hello? Hello?

14:30.317 --> 14:31.215
Hello?

14:32.492 --> 14:33.389
Anybody?

14:39.326 --> 14:40.224
Hello.

14:41.087 --> 14:41.915
Hi. Excuse me.

14:44.331 --> 14:45.505
Hi. Hi, excuse me.

14:45.539 --> 14:47.334
For crying
out loud child.

14:47.369 --> 14:48.542
Sorry.

14:48.577 --> 14:49.889
- Really, sorry.
- What is it you want?

14:49.923 --> 14:52.477
Um, well, hi,
I'm June Schroeder.

14:52.512 --> 14:54.100
I called ahead and
left a message.

14:54.134 --> 14:56.861
Well, don't come in
with the garbage, girl.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.173
Go around front
like a human being.

14:58.207 --> 15:00.278
Well, I tried,
but it was locked.

15:14.292 --> 15:15.190
Hello?

15:17.882 --> 15:19.332
Hello, are you in there now?

15:20.678 --> 15:23.060
Whom shall
I say is calling?

15:23.094 --> 15:25.441
It's
me. June Schroeder.

15:25.476 --> 15:28.134
We literally just
met around the back.

15:29.963 --> 15:30.826
Finally.

15:31.861 --> 15:33.311
Do you have an appointment?

15:33.346 --> 15:37.660
Uh, no. Like I said, I, I
called ahead and left a message.

15:37.695 --> 15:38.972
If all you need
is the pleasure

15:39.007 --> 15:40.594
of talking to our
answering service,

15:40.629 --> 15:42.148
you can do that at any time.

15:42.182 --> 15:43.459
No appointment necessary.

15:44.598 --> 15:46.393
I just wanna talk
to someone in charge.

15:47.636 --> 15:49.189
Whom shall I say is calling?

15:51.709 --> 15:54.884
Look, you can stop
playing games with me now.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.680
I've had a look
around this place.

15:57.715 --> 15:59.855
It is anything but busy, okay?

16:00.994 --> 16:04.998
But you know,
it sure looked to me

16:05.033 --> 16:07.483
like you were digging
up something out back

16:07.518 --> 16:10.383
that you maybe weren't
supposed to have.

16:10.417 --> 16:14.111
So I will get through to someone
in charge sooner or later.

16:14.145 --> 16:16.803
Might as well make it sooner
while I'm more willing

16:16.837 --> 16:19.495
to keep quiet about
certain things, huh?

16:24.500 --> 16:27.296
Well, you got through
sooner than you thought.

16:27.331 --> 16:28.953
That's right. I'm in charge.

16:30.265 --> 16:32.612
First the head of the
board left, then the board,

16:32.646 --> 16:35.753
then the general manager,
and then the station manager.

16:35.787 --> 16:39.136
And who do you think they
dumped all their decisions on?

16:40.585 --> 16:43.174
Don't even think about trying
to play games with me, kiddo.

16:46.488 --> 16:47.903
So,

16:47.937 --> 16:49.905
you admit you could
really use some help then?

16:51.286 --> 16:53.357
You wanna know why my
checkbook's staying shut?

16:53.391 --> 16:54.910
You never argue.

16:54.944 --> 16:56.567
Well, you know,
most places, Mr. Leech,

16:56.601 --> 16:57.878
wouldn't consider that
very professional.

16:57.913 --> 16:59.777
I've got all the
help I can stand.

17:01.917 --> 17:03.850
What just got into you?

17:05.645 --> 17:07.716
Hold it. Wait a minute.

17:07.750 --> 17:09.545
How do you think
we handled things

17:09.580 --> 17:12.341
on the set of "The
Woking Mysteries?"

17:12.376 --> 17:15.896
Arguments, that's how. We
weren't afraid to argue.

17:15.931 --> 17:18.451
Yeah, I, I heard how
things went down on that set.

17:18.485 --> 17:20.763
Stuff of legend. Am I right?

17:20.798 --> 17:22.696
Yeah, like Mt. Vesuvius.

17:22.731 --> 17:25.975
Keeping things peaceful
here. Mr. Leech, I-

17:26.010 --> 17:29.048
Well, look who still
can't close a deal?

17:30.428 --> 17:32.465
What are you doing here?

17:32.499 --> 17:35.019
What is she doing here?

17:35.054 --> 17:38.367
So tell me, are you actively
saying the wrong things

17:38.402 --> 17:40.680
or are you just forgetting
to say the right ones?

17:40.714 --> 17:43.959
Like how this station is number
42 in the national market.

17:43.993 --> 17:46.134
And that's pretty good for out
of 300 something affiliates.

17:46.168 --> 17:48.101
You know, I led with
that little detail.

17:48.136 --> 17:49.033
Thank you.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.517
Well, there's your problem.

17:50.552 --> 17:52.519
Anyone can lead with
something generic.

17:52.554 --> 17:53.624
What are you gonna come up with

17:53.658 --> 17:54.970
that means something to him?

17:55.004 --> 17:56.523
I did my homework. Okay.

17:56.558 --> 17:57.593
Well, he had a series.

17:57.628 --> 17:59.354
I know I heard that much.

17:59.388 --> 18:01.252
Don't suppose you were
planning on acknowledging that.

18:01.287 --> 18:02.805
Actually, as a matter of fact,

18:02.840 --> 18:05.532
I have three charts
on it right here.

18:05.567 --> 18:07.569
Old news, old news.

18:07.603 --> 18:09.812
What are you gonna come
up with that's new?

18:09.847 --> 18:12.332
What's the new demo
on the streaming site?

18:12.367 --> 18:15.128
What's the new rebrand on
the compilation series?

18:15.163 --> 18:17.475
I mean, is he really
thinking about these things?

18:17.510 --> 18:20.202
Or is it all just, "Welcome
to the '90s again."

18:20.237 --> 18:22.860
Claire, what is
she doing here?

18:25.621 --> 18:29.591
Don't mind me. I'm just
signing this enormous check.

18:29.625 --> 18:32.766
Well, not too enormous.

18:32.801 --> 18:35.321
Just a little something.

18:35.355 --> 18:38.634
A little pledge for the month.

18:38.669 --> 18:42.155
See now I know, you
people give a darn.

18:42.190 --> 18:45.089
Well, thank you
Mr. Leech. I'd...

18:45.124 --> 18:47.850
I'll be seeing a lot more
of you around here, right?

18:49.956 --> 18:54.581
So now let's go shoot.

18:59.828 --> 19:03.176
Claire, what's going on here?

19:03.211 --> 19:04.315
Job interview.

19:05.489 --> 19:08.699
So if I hire her,
what am I getting?

19:09.562 --> 19:10.770
I'm right here.

19:10.804 --> 19:11.978
He's your reference.

19:13.393 --> 19:14.946
Well?

19:14.981 --> 19:18.018
I guarantee you that
she doesn't understand

19:18.053 --> 19:21.021
the first thing about
working in broadcast,

19:21.056 --> 19:23.955
aside from maybe what
she Googled last night.

19:23.990 --> 19:25.233
Well, six months ago,

19:25.267 --> 19:27.476
all I knew how to
do was scheduling.

19:27.511 --> 19:28.581
Anything else?

19:30.686 --> 19:31.791
She's a royal pill.

19:33.068 --> 19:33.965
Observed.

19:36.347 --> 19:39.454
And anything else?

19:44.010 --> 19:44.907
She's smart.

19:47.393 --> 19:48.290
She's real smart.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.568
That we can work with.

19:53.088 --> 19:55.918
This can keep us going
for another week,

19:55.953 --> 19:57.265
including her salary.

19:58.542 --> 19:59.543
Wanna stick around?

20:00.578 --> 20:01.510
Get more pledges.

20:06.757 --> 20:10.692
So.

20:10.726 --> 20:12.625
So.

20:12.659 --> 20:14.282
- So...
- Ugh.

20:16.905 --> 20:18.286
This is where you ended up.

20:19.666 --> 20:21.841
Do you always give people
grief for saving your workplace?

20:21.875 --> 20:24.568
Is it
too much to hope

20:24.602 --> 20:26.363
that you actually
did Google something

20:26.397 --> 20:27.950
about working in
broadcast last night?

20:27.985 --> 20:29.469
- Or...
- Look.

20:29.504 --> 20:31.368
Didn't I just hear that
guy say you have a shoot?

20:33.404 --> 20:34.992
- Yes.
- Hmm.

20:35.026 --> 20:36.476
Yes he did.

20:36.511 --> 20:38.754
As a matter of fact,
since you work here now,

20:39.997 --> 20:41.447
you should come sit
in on it, newbie.

20:44.450 --> 20:46.210
Hmm.

20:51.457 --> 20:53.942
Hello, movie
lovers everywhere.

20:53.976 --> 20:55.426
I'm Cary Leech,

20:55.461 --> 20:59.706
star of "The Reverend
Woking Mysteries"

20:59.741 --> 21:03.745
and your host for this
edition of "Weekend Classics."

21:03.779 --> 21:07.921
Tonight's movie stars the
infamous Charlie Chaplin.

21:07.956 --> 21:10.096
A giant of the silent screen,

21:10.130 --> 21:13.893
he almost made it in talkies
before leaving the U.S.

21:13.927 --> 21:16.585
to take over Germany
and start World War II.

21:17.828 --> 21:20.140
It wasn't long before
his next picture,

21:20.175 --> 21:24.110
"The Scarlet Empress"
inadvertently helped launch

21:24.144 --> 21:26.768
the Red Scare in his
native U.S. of A.

21:34.016 --> 21:34.983
How you feeling?

21:36.778 --> 21:38.124
My brain hurts.

21:39.332 --> 21:42.784
This, this cannot be
your business model.

21:42.818 --> 21:45.994
Just let him spout nonsense
introducing old movies

21:46.028 --> 21:48.859
so he'll, he'll make a
donation every once in a while.

21:48.893 --> 21:51.240
Not donations, pledges.

21:52.241 --> 21:53.484
We call 'em pledges.

21:53.519 --> 21:54.968
Ew. Don't say pledge.

21:55.003 --> 21:57.074
That gives me
sorority flashbacks.

21:59.145 --> 22:01.561
Well, it's what we
got going on for now.

22:02.942 --> 22:05.324
Unless you know somebody with
some really deep pockets.

22:06.566 --> 22:10.259
Um, let's just say
no to that.

22:10.294 --> 22:12.607
Yep. Me neither.

22:14.022 --> 22:17.474
So one week to get him to
open his checkbook again.

22:19.165 --> 22:22.202
It's not our only
deadline, but, yeah.

22:23.272 --> 22:24.481
And the only two
things he cares about

22:24.515 --> 22:27.415
are being on screen
and watching us fight,

22:27.449 --> 22:29.900
and one of which he
already has by default.

22:31.039 --> 22:31.936
Yeah.

22:35.975 --> 22:39.358
So, are we gonna fight?

22:45.502 --> 22:46.503
Just try and keep up.

22:48.539 --> 22:50.161
Yeah. Remember to
tell yourself that.

23:01.863 --> 23:03.830
Broadcast. Point me to it.

23:04.935 --> 23:06.799
You mean, you
mean like streaming?

23:47.115 --> 23:49.013
All right, let's get
our foreign programming

23:49.048 --> 23:50.601
converted over to NTSB,

23:50.636 --> 23:54.294
resolution 16x9 in 1920 by 24p.

23:56.193 --> 23:57.125
Wow.

23:57.159 --> 23:58.367
Yeah, just gotta say,

23:59.817 --> 24:02.648
none of what you just said
made any sense at all.

24:06.824 --> 24:08.930
Wait, so you're telling me

24:08.964 --> 24:11.622
that you tried to learn
about modern electronics

24:11.657 --> 24:13.728
in a printed volume?

24:13.762 --> 24:15.833
What's wrong with a book?

24:15.868 --> 24:17.525
Mm, lots of books.

24:17.559 --> 24:19.527
You didn't even start
with Google? Come on.

24:19.561 --> 24:22.357
Would you look at
this stuff? It's old.

24:22.391 --> 24:24.255
Okay. But it's not that old.

24:25.118 --> 24:26.879
It's just specialized.

24:26.913 --> 24:29.122
Like, really specialized.

24:30.192 --> 24:31.815
Honestly, I'm not even sure

24:31.849 --> 24:34.058
if you could find what
you're looking for on Google.

24:35.474 --> 24:37.303
Are you saying the exact
thing you just suggested

24:37.337 --> 24:39.063
would not have even worked?

24:39.098 --> 24:42.170
What I'm saying is
it's a craft, you know?

24:42.204 --> 24:43.551
It's its own craft.

24:43.585 --> 24:46.450
And I spent four years
learning this stuff in college,

24:46.485 --> 24:49.004
and you thought that you
were gonna cram it all in

24:49.039 --> 24:50.489
in an all-nighter.

24:50.523 --> 24:52.767
Some of us like to
get a head start, okay?

24:53.699 --> 24:55.286
Whatever. Let's just start now.

24:57.323 --> 24:58.427
Okay.

24:58.462 --> 25:00.395
So live switching.

25:00.429 --> 25:01.914
Yes, live switching.

25:01.948 --> 25:03.053
I remember that.

25:03.087 --> 25:04.572
Yeah.

25:04.606 --> 25:06.125
So I bet you're looking for
a great big switch, right?

25:07.920 --> 25:08.817
Yeah.

25:11.786 --> 25:14.167
Of course. Mouse clicks.

25:14.202 --> 25:15.341
Mm-hmm.

25:15.375 --> 25:16.963
Because everything's
a computer now.

25:16.998 --> 25:18.206
- Yeah-
- Okay.

25:18.240 --> 25:20.139
even airplanes are
great big computers now.

25:22.348 --> 25:24.212
Now you're just being mean.

26:07.151 --> 26:09.084
Uh-uh. No, no way.

26:09.119 --> 26:10.983
Yes. Yes you did.

26:11.017 --> 26:12.156
You missed that cue.

26:12.191 --> 26:13.779
Oh, 'cause you miscued me.

26:13.813 --> 26:17.334
I did miscue you
once, but it was not that time.

26:17.368 --> 26:19.578
Right, so if I
can't trust your cues,

26:19.612 --> 26:20.889
I have to figure
them out on my own.

26:20.924 --> 26:22.511
You're getting
hung up on one cue.

26:22.546 --> 26:23.685
You said so yourself,

26:23.720 --> 26:25.756
there's no second
takes when you're live.

26:25.791 --> 26:27.102
Hey, love birds.

26:27.137 --> 26:30.416
We've got "Miles
Gloriosus" back in an hour.

26:30.450 --> 26:31.728
Get ready for showtime.

26:35.524 --> 26:36.491
Showtime.

26:37.319 --> 26:38.355
Hmm.

26:38.389 --> 26:40.840
Well, what can
we come up with?

26:42.221 --> 26:43.532
You're seriously
trying to tell me

26:43.567 --> 26:46.259
that you wanna do a
zoom-to-medium closeup

26:46.294 --> 26:47.882
in the middle of camera two?

26:47.916 --> 26:49.711
Yes. Yes, it's perfect.

26:49.746 --> 26:51.782
Read the script. It's
the exact right moment.

26:51.817 --> 26:53.335
I've read the script and no,

26:53.370 --> 26:55.890
you still understand nothing
about screen grammar.

26:55.924 --> 26:58.720
Oh, please. To heck
with the screen grammar.

26:58.755 --> 27:00.066
Ride the fricking moment.

27:00.101 --> 27:01.516
What do you mean
by the moment?

27:01.550 --> 27:02.448
- I mean-
- There's a formula.

27:02.482 --> 27:03.760
- Ride the-
- You follow it.

27:03.794 --> 27:05.347
The screen grammar is important.

27:05.382 --> 27:06.625
- I don't know why.
- I've been doing this

27:06.659 --> 27:07.971
- way longer than you.
- Oh,

27:08.005 --> 27:09.213
- here we go again with that.
- So let's go.

27:09.248 --> 27:10.663
Let's not forget,

27:10.698 --> 27:11.837
you wouldn't even be
here if it wasn't for me.

27:11.871 --> 27:13.114
Mm-hmm.

27:13.148 --> 27:15.737
Okay, first of
all, a little low.

27:17.877 --> 27:21.053
I am telling you she is
not at Haggle's anymore.

27:21.087 --> 27:24.539
Now, I know somebody in this
town knows where she's working.

27:24.573 --> 27:26.092
You stop putting me off.

27:28.094 --> 27:31.753
Don't give me that,
wouldn't hire her crap.

27:31.788 --> 27:34.791
They'd be idiots not to hire
her. They'd all be idiots.

27:34.825 --> 27:36.275
And they're even bigger idiots

27:36.309 --> 27:38.346
if they think they can
hide her beneath a bushel.

27:38.380 --> 27:40.624
Now, do you have some more
news for me, or do you not?

27:43.213 --> 27:44.732
Yeah, that's what I thought.

27:44.766 --> 27:46.526
Enjoy the coal in your stocking.

27:49.219 --> 27:50.807
And that wraps up our showing

27:50.841 --> 27:53.948
of one of the most
holly-jolliest movies of all time.

27:53.982 --> 27:56.502
Doesn't it just warm
your heart folks?

27:56.536 --> 27:58.021
I watch that one

27:58.055 --> 28:01.576
and I just want to go to
sleep smiling every time.

28:01.610 --> 28:04.406
We'll be back next week with
another "Holly Jolly Hour"

28:04.441 --> 28:07.064
that will bring your whole
family together once more.

28:07.099 --> 28:10.033
I would like to thank
everyone here at KPRP

28:10.067 --> 28:13.277
for making this possible,
including Claire Rubin,

28:13.312 --> 28:17.074
our everything that needs
done, she does it person.

28:17.109 --> 28:21.734
And we got Declan
Riordan, our producer.

28:21.769 --> 28:23.460
I'll give you something
to be thankful for

28:23.494 --> 28:24.944
you holly jolly son-of-a-

28:24.979 --> 28:29.500
And new on the team,
June Schroeder.

28:30.847 --> 28:35.092
Oh, it's our most wonderful
time of the year, folks.

28:35.921 --> 28:36.853
What are you grateful for?

28:44.964 --> 28:46.655
KPRP Public
Television, how can I-

28:46.690 --> 28:49.175
Is this how you treat
all your important calls?

28:50.970 --> 28:52.316
Excuse me?

28:52.351 --> 28:54.042
Yeah. Well, don't
worry about it.

28:54.077 --> 28:56.355
Nobody's any better these days.

28:56.389 --> 28:58.288
Just gimme the man in charge.

28:58.322 --> 29:01.394
- The what?
- The man in charge.

29:01.429 --> 29:04.501
You think I got all day to
fuel your office gossip?

29:07.193 --> 29:08.401
Whom shall I say his calling?

29:08.436 --> 29:10.369
John Schroeder.

29:10.403 --> 29:13.475
Yeah, that's right,
the John Schroeder.

29:13.510 --> 29:14.511
Schroeder?

29:14.545 --> 29:16.064
Yeah.

29:16.099 --> 29:18.584
I bet you regret dragging
your feet now, don't you?

29:18.618 --> 29:20.586
Well, nevermind.

29:20.620 --> 29:22.070
Just gimme the man in charge

29:22.105 --> 29:24.314
and we can forget your
little fit ever happened.

29:26.834 --> 29:28.180
One moment, please, sir.

29:32.046 --> 29:32.943
June?!

29:34.634 --> 29:36.498
Oh, no. No, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

29:38.052 --> 29:40.019
So you do know him?

29:40.054 --> 29:42.815
How did he find
out I'm working here?

29:42.850 --> 29:44.023
You told him.

29:44.058 --> 29:45.093
Hey, I don't
even know the guy.

29:46.129 --> 29:47.199
Family?

29:48.545 --> 29:50.374
He's my dad.

29:50.409 --> 29:53.101
Your dad.

29:53.136 --> 29:55.621
The John Schroeder
is your dad.

29:55.655 --> 29:57.692
Oh, so now you know him.

29:57.726 --> 29:59.142
Well, we know of him.

29:59.176 --> 30:01.040
He's kind of famous.

30:01.075 --> 30:02.662
Guy like that,

30:02.697 --> 30:05.804
he could make all of
our problems disappear with one pledge.

30:06.908 --> 30:09.980
He's not
calling to pledge.

30:10.015 --> 30:12.362
- He's calling to buy.
- Buy what?

30:12.396 --> 30:13.777
Everything. Everything.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.227
It doesn't matter.

30:15.261 --> 30:17.643
The station, everything
in it, you, me, him.

30:18.402 --> 30:19.887
And he does realize

30:19.921 --> 30:21.716
that's not something that
can actually happen, right?

30:24.270 --> 30:25.168
That's true.

30:26.583 --> 30:28.757
That's true. That that can't
actually happen, right Claire?

30:28.792 --> 30:30.552
But please tell me that
can't actually happen.

30:30.587 --> 30:32.347
No. No, it can't.

30:32.382 --> 30:34.142
Charter's not set up that way.

30:34.177 --> 30:37.076
Although, he could
push for a few things

30:37.111 --> 30:39.354
in exchange for a
large enough pledge.

30:39.389 --> 30:41.149
But even then
there'd be pushback.

30:43.842 --> 30:46.223
He's not gonna settle
for less than everything.

30:47.776 --> 30:49.882
So you're saying there's no
point in making nice with him

30:49.917 --> 30:51.056
and hoping he'll pledge?

30:55.543 --> 30:56.337
Pity.

30:57.614 --> 31:00.341
Just please don't
make me talk to him.

31:06.416 --> 31:09.971
What?

31:10.006 --> 31:12.422
- Okay, moving on.
- Yeah.

31:12.456 --> 31:13.733
- Stress ball.
- No.

31:14.873 --> 31:15.770
Yes.

31:29.094 --> 31:29.991
Hello.

31:30.026 --> 31:31.234
And thank you for calling

31:31.268 --> 31:33.201
the voice activated
answering service

31:33.236 --> 31:36.101
for KPRP Public Television.

31:36.135 --> 31:39.759
Please state the name of
the person you wish to call.

31:39.794 --> 31:41.071
You want me to what?

31:41.106 --> 31:42.245
I'm sorry.

31:42.279 --> 31:44.109
I don't understand that command.

31:44.143 --> 31:46.732
Please state the name of
the person you wish to call.

31:46.766 --> 31:48.596
Just get me the front desk.

31:48.630 --> 31:51.392
I'm sorry, I don't
understand that command.

31:51.426 --> 31:53.601
Please state the name of
the person you wish to-

31:53.635 --> 31:55.361
Front desk!

31:55.396 --> 31:58.088
I'm sorry, I don't
understand that command.

31:58.123 --> 31:59.296
Please state the name of-

31:59.331 --> 32:01.126
Front desk! Front
desk, already.

32:01.160 --> 32:02.921
Front desk.

32:02.955 --> 32:04.163
At the sound with the tone,

32:04.198 --> 32:07.373
the time will be 10
minutes past the hour.

32:07.408 --> 32:10.031
Finally, something diff-

32:10.066 --> 32:11.239
Wait, what?

32:11.274 --> 32:13.103
Would you like to
take this brief survey?

32:13.138 --> 32:16.141
No,
don't do this to me.

32:16.175 --> 32:18.764
It's been years since I've
been in phone tree purgatory.

32:18.798 --> 32:21.111
You've just qualified
for an exciting offer.

32:21.146 --> 32:25.253
Front desk, you
stupid miserable piece of silicon trash.

32:25.288 --> 32:26.530
What's so hard about that?

32:26.565 --> 32:29.913
Just get me the stupid
stinking front desk.

32:29.948 --> 32:32.467
Have you considered
switching wireless carriers?

32:32.502 --> 32:33.330
Ah!

32:33.365 --> 32:35.056
Front desk. Front desk.

32:35.091 --> 32:36.678
If you don't gimme
the front desk,

32:36.713 --> 32:38.715
I will leave you for
hobos on skid row.

32:38.749 --> 32:40.510
Please enter the
last four digits of

32:40.544 --> 32:43.927
- your social security number.
- Ah!

32:43.962 --> 32:48.967
Just get lost, you stupid,
stinking pile of transistors.

32:49.001 --> 32:52.280
Just get lost and, and goodbye.

32:52.315 --> 32:54.351
Goodbye. And get lost too.

32:59.391 --> 33:04.258
Hello, you
have an important reminder.

33:15.441 --> 33:16.960
All right, Miss Radio Voice.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.203
Show your darn face

33:18.237 --> 33:20.239
before I waylay your
boss on his way home.

33:21.792 --> 33:23.415
Whom shall
I say is calling?

33:23.449 --> 33:24.864
You know who's here.

33:24.899 --> 33:26.728
I told you once,
I told you twice,

33:26.763 --> 33:29.593
and I ain't gonna tell you
a darn thing ever again.

33:29.628 --> 33:31.768
Well, thank
goodness for that.

33:31.802 --> 33:32.700
Have a good day, sir.

33:32.734 --> 33:34.288
Wait, what? No, hold on.

33:34.322 --> 33:35.944
Hold on. Get back on here.

33:35.979 --> 33:38.154
You miserable,
little minimum wage-

33:38.188 --> 33:39.741
Excuse me.

33:41.088 --> 33:43.297
Claire, sweetie. Guess who?

33:45.540 --> 33:47.335
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:47.370 --> 33:49.751
Where do you think
you're going, beautiful.

33:49.786 --> 33:51.788
This is a closed set.

33:51.822 --> 33:53.686
Yeah, you
try and talk smart to me

33:53.721 --> 33:56.068
after I get a
signature on these.

33:56.103 --> 33:56.896
Oh, those.

33:57.932 --> 33:58.864
Oh, of course.

34:00.521 --> 34:04.697
Always have time for my
fans, even the noisy ones.

34:05.767 --> 34:09.633
And remember, if you're
going scalp these,

34:09.668 --> 34:11.773
don't settle for
less than a grand.

34:19.747 --> 34:22.370
- Hello, darling.
- Hello.

34:22.405 --> 34:25.166
- You look ravishing today.
- Well, thank you.

34:25.201 --> 34:26.754
How are you Charmer?

34:28.100 --> 34:29.412
We're late. We're late again.

34:29.446 --> 34:30.516
And I am not the reason.

34:30.551 --> 34:31.759
Um, yes, you are.

34:31.793 --> 34:33.830
And you're not about to
pin this on me, okay?

34:33.864 --> 34:35.694
All right. Pardon
me, Mr. Leech.

34:35.728 --> 34:38.283
Declan here was just having
some technical difficulties

34:38.317 --> 34:40.285
- at his workstation.
- Oh, pardon me, Mr. Leech,

34:40.319 --> 34:41.907
but it seems that June
here has forgotten

34:41.941 --> 34:43.840
how to format a shooting script,

34:43.874 --> 34:46.118
which as you know, is very
important for her job.

34:46.153 --> 34:48.086
Okay, well, pardon
me, Mr. Leech,

34:48.120 --> 34:51.054
Declan has forgotten how
to stick to a call time.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.400
Shall we head for makeup?

34:52.435 --> 34:55.058
By which I mean make
up for his delays.

34:55.093 --> 34:56.680
What she's saying
is absolutely false.

34:56.715 --> 34:57.923
I've never missed a
call time, Mr. Leech.

34:57.957 --> 34:58.682
- Don't listen to him.
- But come with us.

34:58.717 --> 34:59.373
We gotta go, okay?

34:59.407 --> 35:00.374
Bye Claire.

35:00.408 --> 35:01.616
- I understand-
- Listen to me-

35:01.651 --> 35:03.066
that call times are
of the utmost importance

35:03.101 --> 35:04.585
- Call time is very important-
- And treating you like

35:04.619 --> 35:09.210
- a star is what really matters.
- as you well know from your-

35:15.320 --> 35:17.943
You got another one of those?

35:26.641 --> 35:29.299
I mean, he doesn't
honestly think

35:29.334 --> 35:31.508
that "The Wizard of
Oz" switched to color

35:31.543 --> 35:33.407
because they ran out of
black and white film.

35:33.441 --> 35:34.339
Does he?

35:36.410 --> 35:40.034
Honestly, who can say.

35:40.068 --> 35:40.966
Oh. Gimme that.

35:46.661 --> 35:50.389
I mean, we didn't
always do this right?

35:50.424 --> 35:52.391
Just give some loud mouth

35:52.426 --> 35:55.808
a permanent platform
to spout lunacy from?

35:55.843 --> 35:58.328
Because if I wanted that,
I could just call home.

36:00.399 --> 36:01.262
No.

36:02.643 --> 36:05.059
No. This place
used to have a rep.

36:05.093 --> 36:06.543
Good one.

36:08.821 --> 36:11.134
Award-winning programs,

36:11.169 --> 36:13.309
valuable community
institutions, all that.

36:14.931 --> 36:16.795
You can't tell from
looking around today.

36:16.829 --> 36:19.522
Dumped all the archives just
before I got here. So...

36:26.563 --> 36:27.633
All of them?

36:54.350 --> 36:55.868
What are those?

36:57.594 --> 36:58.492
Legacy.

37:15.957 --> 37:16.855
We made that?

37:18.857 --> 37:21.653
We used to every year.

37:22.964 --> 37:25.588
One Christmas spectacular
was all we needed

37:25.622 --> 37:30.282
and then we'd get in enough
pledges for the next 12 months.

37:31.387 --> 37:35.287
Local history, local
politics, documentaries,

37:36.392 --> 37:37.876
the stuff that
made a difference.

37:38.946 --> 37:40.396
Why'd you stop?

37:40.430 --> 37:42.812
The board wanted to go edgy.

37:42.846 --> 37:45.884
Thought these fancy
concerts were too expensive.

37:45.918 --> 37:49.267
Wanted to cut it to the
bone and do more with less.

37:50.371 --> 37:52.718
Instead, we ended up
doing less with less.

37:52.753 --> 37:54.686
And now we're doing
next to nothing.

37:56.412 --> 37:58.448
So where's the board now?

37:58.483 --> 37:59.967
Where do you think?

38:00.001 --> 38:02.487
Bailed once they realized
how badly they'd screwed up,

38:02.521 --> 38:05.800
and believe me, nobody was
volunteering to replace them.

38:10.149 --> 38:12.359
Well, let's do
one of these again.

38:15.189 --> 38:17.674
Oh, come on. How hard can it be?

38:17.709 --> 38:19.124
"How hard can it be?"

38:19.158 --> 38:21.057
"How hard can it be?" she says.

38:22.438 --> 38:26.994
Sweetie, we earned those 12
months every single time.

38:28.098 --> 38:29.030
Do you have any
idea what it takes

38:29.065 --> 38:31.101
to stage a show like that?

38:31.136 --> 38:32.724
No. So tell me.

38:32.758 --> 38:33.932
My word.

38:35.968 --> 38:38.937
Multiple cameras,
live switching,

38:38.971 --> 38:42.181
on location, music clearances.

38:42.216 --> 38:44.632
Kept the lawyers
busy for weeks.

38:44.667 --> 38:47.152
Plus, it looks like we
always had a star name

38:47.186 --> 38:48.429
to host the show.

38:48.464 --> 38:49.982
That's right.

38:50.017 --> 38:52.916
Star power or the closest
thing to it at this level.

38:54.055 --> 38:57.300
Mayor, some big news
anchor, somebody.

38:57.335 --> 39:00.993
And who is gonna give
us the time of day now?

39:01.028 --> 39:03.927
Plus we don't have much
time to work with anyway.

39:03.962 --> 39:05.998
Christmas is practically here.

39:06.033 --> 39:07.690
So let's do it next Christmas.

39:07.724 --> 39:10.555
No, there is no next year.

39:10.589 --> 39:12.488
We've got a mortgage
on this dump

39:12.522 --> 39:16.077
and we have burned through
every trick for putting it off.

39:16.112 --> 39:19.943
Either we come up with a huge
chunk of change by New Year's,

39:19.978 --> 39:25.017
or we go dark for the
first time in five decades.

39:25.570 --> 39:26.674
New Year's?

39:26.709 --> 39:28.366
It's a hard deadline?

39:29.436 --> 39:30.644
As hard as they come.

39:34.095 --> 39:36.822
Do you two want to be employed
after the balloon drop?

39:40.826 --> 39:43.381
Get that man to pledge.

39:55.289 --> 39:56.221
New Year's.

39:58.119 --> 39:59.017
Yeah.

40:00.674 --> 40:02.054
You got any bright ideas?

40:06.231 --> 40:09.234
Well, he's already
paying this much

40:09.268 --> 40:10.615
to see us squabble, right?

40:12.030 --> 40:13.376
Let's kick it up a notch.

40:14.895 --> 40:16.414
Kick it up.

40:16.448 --> 40:17.794
Play for blood.

40:17.829 --> 40:19.693
So far we've been pretty nice.

40:19.727 --> 40:21.315
I don't think
we've been very nice.

40:21.349 --> 40:23.213
There are definitely
places you could've gone

40:23.248 --> 40:25.353
and you didn't
because you're nice.

40:26.389 --> 40:27.286
Face it.

40:27.321 --> 40:29.530
Nice, just won't do it anymore.

40:29.565 --> 40:32.291
Well, June, I, I just
don't think it's a very good-

40:32.326 --> 40:33.983
Daddy issues.
Hit me with those.

40:34.017 --> 40:36.364
You'll have material for days.

40:36.399 --> 40:37.780
Okay, come on now, gimme
something I can work with.

40:37.814 --> 40:39.057
June, seriously?

40:39.091 --> 40:40.299
- I don't think it's-
- Declan, you've seen

40:40.334 --> 40:41.577
what I go back to if
I can't stay here.

40:47.583 --> 40:51.379
If you can't do it for the
station, then do it for me.

41:00.285 --> 41:02.805
Open the door. I got
your heart's desire.

41:02.839 --> 41:04.220
You brought
George Clooney?

41:04.254 --> 41:07.361
Oh wait, no, I...

41:15.265 --> 41:17.544
I bring you nectar and ambrosia.

41:19.235 --> 41:21.755
That's a terrible
name for a rock band.

41:32.697 --> 41:35.389
I bring you the
glorious wines of nature.

41:35.423 --> 41:37.218
If those
weren't metaphorical,

41:37.253 --> 41:38.530
you might've stood a chance.

41:38.565 --> 41:39.876
Wait. I, I would?

41:42.465 --> 41:43.259
Ah!

42:05.557 --> 42:06.489
Hey, Big John.

42:08.146 --> 42:09.043
Whoa.

42:11.149 --> 42:13.634
Clean up on aisle five.

42:13.669 --> 42:15.222
What in the world was...

42:16.672 --> 42:19.122
You hog!

42:19.157 --> 42:21.124
It's not even nine
o'clock in the morning.

42:21.159 --> 42:22.056
You get a off this property.

42:22.091 --> 42:23.713
- Ah!
- Get, get, get!

42:24.887 --> 42:26.716
Oh, Cary dear.

42:26.751 --> 42:29.926
- I'm so sorry about that.
- Oh, no worries.

42:29.961 --> 42:32.066
I know this is a
good neighborhood.

42:32.101 --> 42:33.965
Well, usually.

42:44.631 --> 42:45.528
So.

42:46.425 --> 42:47.323
So?

42:49.290 --> 42:50.222
So.

42:51.845 --> 42:53.640
That's your idea?

42:53.674 --> 42:56.263
You can feel free to start
praising it at any time.

42:57.747 --> 43:01.199
We've got our biggest name
talent sitting right over there

43:01.233 --> 43:03.615
and you wanna shoot him
like a '90s talk show.

43:03.650 --> 43:06.342
Yeah. That was a
great era of television.

43:06.376 --> 43:08.724
That was almost
older than you are.

43:08.758 --> 43:10.070
Who is gonna watch that?

43:10.104 --> 43:12.106
Oh, I don't know. Everyone.

43:12.141 --> 43:14.695
This is television.
There is no everyone.

43:15.558 --> 43:16.628
What group?

43:16.663 --> 43:18.009
Which age?

43:18.043 --> 43:21.529
Kids, parents, grandparents,
everyone in between.

43:21.564 --> 43:23.290
Okay? People crave this stuff.

43:23.324 --> 43:25.948
Families don't watch
things together anymore.

43:25.982 --> 43:27.294
What century are you from?

43:27.328 --> 43:29.641
They can, they can.

43:29.676 --> 43:31.194
And they do.

43:31.229 --> 43:34.577
- Name one. Name one family.
- I'll give you one family.

43:34.612 --> 43:37.269
- Mine.
- Yeah. One weird family.

43:37.304 --> 43:40.169
Yeah. We
were weird, all right.

43:40.203 --> 43:43.690
Me, Mom, and a jar of
ashes on the mantle

43:43.724 --> 43:44.829
that used to be Dad.

43:46.002 --> 43:48.591
Car accident, in case
you were wondering.

43:48.626 --> 43:50.455
Oh, I was four, by the way

43:50.489 --> 43:52.388
and Mom had to keep working.

43:52.422 --> 43:54.873
So the time that
we spent together

43:54.908 --> 43:57.669
was mostly watching
KPRP kids programs

43:57.704 --> 43:58.705
early in the morning.

43:59.913 --> 44:01.742
That's what we
did together most.

44:01.777 --> 44:03.813
So, yeah, we watched it.

44:04.952 --> 44:06.989
And lots of us still would.

44:07.023 --> 44:09.439
Don't you dare think otherwise.

44:11.683 --> 44:14.099
Come on, don't let him win.

44:18.310 --> 44:19.795
What if I said you were lucky?

44:19.829 --> 44:22.729
- Lucky?
- Lucky.

44:22.763 --> 44:24.144
At least your mom
cared about you.

44:24.178 --> 44:25.110
At least she didn't leave.

44:25.145 --> 44:26.629
She left every single day.

44:26.664 --> 44:29.356
And came back.
Not everyone's does.

44:30.460 --> 44:32.462
So what do you
think of that? Huh?

44:32.497 --> 44:34.395
What have we got
for kids like that?

44:34.430 --> 44:37.571
Uh, June, your
dad stuck around.

44:37.605 --> 44:39.538
Yeah, sure. He stuck around.

44:39.573 --> 44:40.885
At least his face did.

44:40.919 --> 44:42.334
His brain? Gone.

44:42.369 --> 44:43.611
Always somewhere else.

44:43.646 --> 44:46.511
At the office, around
the globe, just gone.

44:46.545 --> 44:48.444
At least when your mom was
with you, she was present.

44:48.478 --> 44:50.549
Don't you dare start
making comparisons, okay?

44:50.584 --> 44:52.517
At least your dad is alive.

44:52.551 --> 44:54.657
I would've swapped.
You get that?

44:54.692 --> 44:57.004
There are times I
would've swapped.

44:57.039 --> 44:58.523
At least you know your dad
didn't wanna leave you.

44:58.557 --> 45:01.940
June! You...

45:08.809 --> 45:09.707
Say it.

45:10.811 --> 45:13.124
Whatever it is, just say it.

45:13.158 --> 45:14.642
Say it, say it.

45:21.339 --> 45:23.237
If you were like
this all the time,

45:24.722 --> 45:26.033
I can definitely see why.

45:30.728 --> 45:33.109
- Ah, June.
- What did you say?

45:35.491 --> 45:36.734
What did you say?

45:39.219 --> 45:42.705
I was seven. Seven.

45:42.740 --> 45:44.742
What seven-year-old
deserves that?

45:45.846 --> 45:48.849
To have her mom walk out
and her dad checkout.

45:49.850 --> 45:51.162
And it never stopped.

45:51.196 --> 45:53.647
Not in middle school,
not in high school,

45:53.681 --> 45:55.891
not even graduating
with fricking honors.

45:55.925 --> 45:57.375
Not for one second

45:57.409 --> 45:59.722
was I ever more important
than a line on a spreadsheet.

46:01.137 --> 46:03.691
And you wanna know
the worst part?

46:03.726 --> 46:07.903
He paid to keep me so
I felt like I owed him.

46:07.937 --> 46:10.043
Like it was some kind of
debt I had to pay back.

46:10.077 --> 46:11.389
You think student loans are bad?

46:11.423 --> 46:13.115
Try having to pay
back a debt like that.

46:13.149 --> 46:14.530
So don't you try and tell me

46:14.564 --> 46:16.290
that I had it any
better than you.

46:18.292 --> 46:21.606
I'm sorry your dad
is gone. I really am.

46:23.125 --> 46:24.851
But at least he
didn't hang around

46:24.885 --> 46:27.060
making whatever
problems you had worse.

46:32.617 --> 46:34.412
What a scene. Ha!

46:34.446 --> 46:36.552
What a scene.

46:36.586 --> 46:38.692
I don't have a check
big enough for that one.

46:38.726 --> 46:41.660
I'm serious. I don't
have a check big enough.

46:42.972 --> 46:44.698
I need to go talk
to some people.

46:45.906 --> 46:46.804
Too much?

46:51.670 --> 46:53.949
Nah. That's not too much.

46:58.746 --> 47:00.300
Now, just gimme a few days.

47:00.334 --> 47:02.578
A few days. No more.

47:02.612 --> 47:04.787
And you'll be hearing
from everyone.

47:04.822 --> 47:06.478
Everyone.

47:06.513 --> 47:08.446
Oh, and this time,

47:08.480 --> 47:12.657
don't forget what a shooting
script is, huh?

47:14.348 --> 47:15.246
Whew.

47:25.773 --> 47:26.947
June, hey, are you okay?

47:26.982 --> 47:27.603
Look, I, I know what
I said was just-

47:27.637 --> 47:28.397
No, I'm fine.

47:28.431 --> 47:29.950
I'm, really, I'm fine.

47:31.538 --> 47:32.953
Just, we got it, right?

47:32.988 --> 47:35.991
Come on, please
tell me we got it.

47:36.025 --> 47:37.061
We got it.

47:38.407 --> 47:42.721
Yes.

47:42.756 --> 47:45.621
Excuse me. I think
your Uber is elsewhere.

47:45.655 --> 47:47.934
You are a callous, rude,

47:47.968 --> 47:50.074
mean little excuse
for a thespian.

47:50.108 --> 47:52.248
Whoa, I've had some
bad reviews before,

47:52.283 --> 47:54.837
but that was a little over
the top, don't you think?

47:54.872 --> 47:56.735
You think this
is Hollywood? Huh?

47:56.770 --> 47:59.359
You think you can just
walk away from anything?

47:59.393 --> 48:02.189
Because, because you're
the big-shot star.

48:02.224 --> 48:03.397
There's no stunt
double out here.

48:03.432 --> 48:05.434
There's no one to
take the fall for you.

48:06.435 --> 48:08.264
Can you cry on cue?

48:08.299 --> 48:09.438
Huh?

48:09.472 --> 48:11.785
- Can you cry on cue?
- Yes. Yes.

48:11.819 --> 48:13.304
Good.

48:13.338 --> 48:15.513
Because if you ever make
my little girl cry again,

48:15.547 --> 48:18.447
you're not only gonna cry on
cue, you're gonna cry off cue

48:18.481 --> 48:20.621
and for the entire running time,

48:20.656 --> 48:23.970
you fourth-rate, Z-grade

48:24.004 --> 48:26.317
certified-farm-fresh,
organic actor.

48:26.351 --> 48:28.940
Whoa.

48:41.125 --> 48:42.091
I felt it.

48:42.954 --> 48:44.162
I really felt it.

48:45.853 --> 48:46.854
I did it.

48:50.789 --> 48:51.756
You did what?

48:54.172 --> 48:57.796
- Um...
- You did what?

48:57.831 --> 48:59.591
Oh my God, I can't believe this.

48:59.626 --> 49:01.214
Just when I thought you'd
finally run out of ways

49:01.248 --> 49:02.698
to royally screw up my life,

49:02.732 --> 49:04.631
you go and invent
a totally new one.

49:04.665 --> 49:06.322
Hey, I'm just trying to help.

49:06.357 --> 49:08.048
Trying and failing.

49:08.083 --> 49:11.189
Do you get that last
part, Dad? Failing.

49:11.224 --> 49:13.295
Look around and listen
for once in your life.

49:13.329 --> 49:15.918
Do I seem any happier when
you pull this stupid stuff?

49:15.953 --> 49:18.231
Well, maybe if you
learned a little gratitude.

49:18.265 --> 49:20.233
Gratitude? For what?

49:20.267 --> 49:21.820
Do you think I was grateful

49:21.855 --> 49:24.513
for every day you spent
screaming on the phone

49:24.547 --> 49:26.273
instead of being with me?

49:26.308 --> 49:28.724
Because whoever was on
the other end of the line

49:28.758 --> 49:30.864
was always more
important than me.

49:30.898 --> 49:33.384
Hey. I paid $3
million for you.

49:33.418 --> 49:35.455
Shut up about the
$3 million, Dad.

49:35.489 --> 49:37.319
You made that back in a month.

49:37.353 --> 49:39.769
You could've retired 15
years ago and you didn't

49:39.804 --> 49:41.840
because nothing is
as important to you

49:41.875 --> 49:45.361
as thinking that the sun doesn't
rise unless you crow at it.

49:45.396 --> 49:47.708
I gave you everything I could.

49:47.743 --> 49:50.711
Yeah, I
guess you did, Dad.

49:52.092 --> 49:53.749
Just not anything that mattered.

49:55.889 --> 49:58.409
- What do I need to do?
- Nothing. Nothing.

49:58.443 --> 50:00.238
Absolutely nothing.

50:00.273 --> 50:01.757
Just stop trying.

50:01.791 --> 50:04.967
That is the only way you'll
stop making things worse.

50:05.002 --> 50:06.520
But I gotta do something.

50:06.555 --> 50:08.039
Too late, Dad.

50:08.074 --> 50:11.077
Just, too late.

50:21.052 --> 50:22.364
So I take it we now know

50:22.398 --> 50:24.538
why Cary Leech
dropped off the map.

50:32.857 --> 50:34.100
Okay. Yep.

50:34.134 --> 50:36.136
We're not gonna wallow
in our own pity here.

50:36.171 --> 50:38.242
So let's go.

50:39.450 --> 50:41.452
There's only one thing
that can fix this.

50:43.281 --> 50:44.248
Breakfast for dinner.

50:46.319 --> 50:47.078
Let's go.

50:48.217 --> 50:49.529
Let's go, people.

50:49.563 --> 50:50.633
Andele. Get a move on.

51:03.612 --> 51:04.509
No, no, no.

51:04.544 --> 51:06.028
This is diet suicide.

51:06.063 --> 51:07.581
Look at this.

51:08.548 --> 51:09.445
I don't care.

51:14.761 --> 51:15.555
Can I have some of this?

51:15.589 --> 51:16.763
Syrup?

51:16.797 --> 51:18.592
Okay. Young metabolisms.

51:18.627 --> 51:19.766
I'm in. Let's do this.

51:24.667 --> 51:25.841
Oh my gosh.

51:27.394 --> 51:28.499
More bacon, anyone?

51:30.604 --> 51:31.847
Evil.

51:36.300 --> 51:37.473
Mm!

51:37.508 --> 51:39.130
Better?

51:39.165 --> 51:42.168
I, I've never felt
better or worse in my life.

51:42.202 --> 51:43.514
Yeah, I hope you don't want

51:43.548 --> 51:45.205
a brainstorming
session right now,

51:45.240 --> 51:48.070
'cause I'm gonna be in
a gluttonous hangover until tomorrow.

51:48.105 --> 51:48.864
I wasn't.

51:50.245 --> 51:54.180
More of a glad to be
still alive session.

51:55.802 --> 51:57.562
It's the only place
that's open this early.

51:59.116 --> 52:01.566
Early enough for my mom to
take me before her shifts.

52:03.189 --> 52:04.259
It's the only place
we ever ate out

52:04.293 --> 52:07.986
so it's a special place.

52:14.821 --> 52:15.718
Claire,

52:19.791 --> 52:21.621
we need to do the
Christmas concert.

52:22.553 --> 52:24.037
Interesting fantasy.

52:24.071 --> 52:26.143
I'm serious. We need to.

52:26.177 --> 52:30.043
Well, the necessity's not
in question, only the means.

52:30.077 --> 52:32.045
We'll think of something.

52:32.079 --> 52:33.150
That is not a plan.

52:33.978 --> 52:35.669
It's Christmas music, right?

52:35.704 --> 52:38.155
I mean, all that famous stuff
is already public domain.

52:38.189 --> 52:40.778
We can make a program
out of anything we want.

52:40.812 --> 52:43.608
Sure. But who's
gonna arrange it?

52:43.643 --> 52:45.921
More importantly,
who's gonna perform it?

52:45.955 --> 52:47.819
I don't know.
We'll find people.

52:47.854 --> 52:51.029
And we're right back
to, that is not a plan.

52:51.064 --> 52:52.583
This is TV. Okay?

52:52.617 --> 52:55.551
And this is not crap
TV either. This is PBS.

52:55.586 --> 52:57.381
That has to mean something.

52:57.415 --> 52:59.624
Yeah, it means we're broke.

52:59.659 --> 53:03.801
It means they'll know we're
not solely about the money.

53:03.835 --> 53:04.905
Um, technically-

53:04.940 --> 53:06.631
- Shut up, Declan.
- Okay.

53:09.945 --> 53:13.017
You know what? Fine, fine.

53:13.051 --> 53:15.502
You wanna plan? Here's the plan.

53:15.537 --> 53:17.055
I will find someone,

53:17.090 --> 53:19.506
you two can sit around in a
sugar coma for all I care.

53:19.541 --> 53:22.440
But I am betting
my entire salary,

53:22.475 --> 53:24.270
which, is really not that much,

53:24.304 --> 53:26.582
but I am betting
my entire salary

53:26.617 --> 53:28.343
that there is at least one,

53:28.377 --> 53:31.277
one really awesome
musician out there

53:31.311 --> 53:33.831
who would cross
oceans to get on PBS.

53:33.865 --> 53:34.728
Mm-hmm.

53:37.421 --> 53:38.284
For PBS!

53:43.427 --> 53:44.773
She's got a lot
of energy today.

53:44.807 --> 53:47.327
No more coffee for her.

53:56.163 --> 53:58.511
Hello? Mr. Krauss.

53:58.545 --> 54:00.306
I'm a
general music director!

54:00.340 --> 54:01.962
Okay. I'm sorry.

54:01.997 --> 54:03.309
I'm sorry. Mr?

54:03.343 --> 54:05.725
I'm a
general music director!

54:05.759 --> 54:06.933
Wait, what was that?

54:08.037 --> 54:10.005
I'm a
general music director!

54:10.039 --> 54:15.079
Okay, Mr.
Aubur-general-music-director.

54:16.391 --> 54:18.151
My name is June Schroeder

54:18.185 --> 54:23.225
and I am a television producer
at KPRP Public Television.

54:24.330 --> 54:26.987
And we would like to
put your choir on TV.

54:29.473 --> 54:32.924
Good morning, ma'am.
Hi. How are you?

54:32.959 --> 54:36.825
We hear you lead the
best orchestra in-

54:38.344 --> 54:39.241
Oh, no, no, ma'am.

54:39.276 --> 54:40.863
I, I'm not selling insurance.

54:40.898 --> 54:42.727
I'm with PBS.

54:44.315 --> 54:48.112
No, not PS5, PBS.

54:48.146 --> 54:51.046
I can't get you a PS5. Sorry.

54:51.080 --> 54:52.910
Please, sir, I,
I have no control

54:52.944 --> 54:56.120
over when they play the
Louis Valois Orchestra

54:56.154 --> 54:57.915
and, and I really don't care-

54:59.951 --> 55:02.989
No, sir, I have no idea what
he's like off the air. Mm-mm.

55:03.023 --> 55:05.750
Ma'am, I, I really
don't have a PS5.

55:05.785 --> 55:07.407
Really sorry about that,

55:07.442 --> 55:09.409
but what I wanted to
talk to you about is-

55:10.928 --> 55:13.758
No. No, I am not hoarding
them to scalp on eBay.

55:13.793 --> 55:15.242
Why would I do that?

55:15.277 --> 55:19.730
I have no idea what he
was like in music school.

55:19.764 --> 55:21.387
Nope. No.

55:21.421 --> 55:22.319
Uh-uh.

55:22.353 --> 55:24.597
Ma'am. Please.

55:24.631 --> 55:28.359
I am a television
producer.

55:28.394 --> 55:30.568
My buddy cannot get you a PS5

55:30.603 --> 55:33.088
because I don't have
a buddy with a PS5.

55:35.228 --> 55:37.023
You wanna know what
we're gonna do?

55:38.956 --> 55:41.027
Here's what we're gonna do.

55:41.061 --> 55:42.615
Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's right.

55:43.961 --> 55:48.345
You and me. You and me,
Aubur-general-music-director.

55:49.518 --> 55:53.902
We are gonna take
Louis Valois down.

55:53.936 --> 55:58.527
You are right. I have PS5s.

55:59.701 --> 56:04.015
I have so many PS5s.

56:04.050 --> 56:06.017
I have despised him too.

56:06.052 --> 56:08.434
Mm-hmm. Oh yeah.

56:08.468 --> 56:11.091
With his waltzes and his fiddles

56:11.126 --> 56:15.993
and his, his, um, mincing harps.

56:17.097 --> 56:19.410
It just started with
a few, you know,

56:19.445 --> 56:22.931
and then I just, I
just couldn't stop.

56:22.965 --> 56:27.073
Boxes and truckloads
and warehouses,

56:27.107 --> 56:30.110
filling up my garage,
the attic, the basement.

56:30.145 --> 56:33.838
At last. I know how
to make him pay.

56:33.873 --> 56:36.807
And only your talent
can do it.

56:36.841 --> 56:39.568
I don't even know if my pets
are still alive in there.

56:40.914 --> 56:45.505
Just lost. Lost in
all of my PS5s.

56:46.610 --> 56:49.854
Will you really
take that many PS5s?

56:49.889 --> 56:52.478
Are you sure you can't take
more? Please take more?

56:57.862 --> 56:59.139
Thank you.

56:59.174 --> 57:02.073
Yes. We can rule together.

57:05.801 --> 57:06.664
Hi.

57:06.699 --> 57:07.907
Hi.

57:07.941 --> 57:09.564
- Uh, how's it going?
- Oh, perfect. Perfect.

57:09.598 --> 57:10.806
Absolutely perfect.

57:10.841 --> 57:12.152
We have all the music
you could ever want.

57:12.187 --> 57:13.809
We just have to find 500 PS5s

57:13.844 --> 57:15.777
and Louis Valois'
violin on a pike.

57:15.811 --> 57:17.295
How about you?

57:17.330 --> 57:18.918
Uh, great. It looks like
we might have a venue.

57:18.952 --> 57:21.852
It's not a definite yes, but
something other than an no.

57:21.886 --> 57:22.715
Okay, well let's go.

57:22.749 --> 57:23.992
- Let's go. C'mon.
- Okay.

57:24.026 --> 57:25.234
Move, move, move. Oh,
wait, I'm outta coffee.

57:25.269 --> 57:26.719
You probably don't
need more. It's okay.

57:37.350 --> 57:39.214
Oh my.

57:41.319 --> 57:42.389
It's perfect.

57:43.321 --> 57:45.876
It's perfect.

57:49.811 --> 57:52.123
Wow, this has always been here?

57:52.158 --> 57:54.160
Why have you never
used it before?

57:54.194 --> 57:56.438
Hey, I wasn't here before.

57:56.473 --> 57:58.060
Plus, I think that
they tried to,

57:58.095 --> 58:00.511
but they could never
get a deal done for it-

58:00.546 --> 58:04.204
Oh my goodness. Would you
just listen to those acoustics?

58:04.239 --> 58:06.966
Hello World! Here we are!

58:07.000 --> 58:09.486
Can you imagine what the choir

58:09.520 --> 58:11.280
is gonna sound like under that?

58:12.316 --> 58:13.731
- And the orchestra?
- Uh, June-

58:13.766 --> 58:15.077
We could do better than this.

58:15.112 --> 58:16.941
You hear me? We
could not do better.

58:17.908 --> 58:21.670
Well, if you can't do better,

58:21.705 --> 58:25.053
you have a good reason
for meeting our price.

58:27.849 --> 58:31.818
So I'm sure you're aware,
we're not a very large station.

58:31.853 --> 58:34.200
You are a station who
has had a half a century

58:34.234 --> 58:35.615
to build an endowment.

58:36.858 --> 58:39.032
Yes. Well, you
know how that goes.

58:39.067 --> 58:40.344
Keeps you in business

58:40.378 --> 58:41.828
but you can't go on any
shopping sprees with it.

58:41.863 --> 58:43.968
Do you have any idea

58:44.003 --> 58:46.799
what the wedding demand
is for a place like this?

58:46.833 --> 58:49.146
Oh, I'm sure it's
a wonderful place-

58:49.180 --> 58:51.769
Do you have any
idea what people pay

58:51.804 --> 58:53.702
for those sorts of things?

58:54.979 --> 58:57.913
And I'm sure a little
classy TV exposure

58:57.948 --> 58:59.397
would be just the thing-

58:59.432 --> 59:03.781
Ms. Schroeder, this
building is a century old

59:03.816 --> 59:08.855
and is visible from virtually
everywhere in the city.

59:10.270 --> 59:14.067
Exactly what makes you think
exposure is anything we need?

59:15.655 --> 59:18.865
We've had our struggles,
and I'm sure you have too.

59:18.900 --> 59:20.280
We really feel
that this could be

59:20.315 --> 59:22.455
- an excellent collaboration-
- Ms. Schroeder,

59:22.489 --> 59:25.976
so far you have failed
to present any scenario

59:26.010 --> 59:30.532
that does not represent
a certain short-term cost

59:30.567 --> 59:34.605
to this church in
exchange for dubious

59:34.640 --> 59:38.402
and highly-uncertain
long-term gains.

59:38.436 --> 59:41.508
So unless you are prepared

59:41.543 --> 59:45.720
to meet our standard rate
for an outside event,

59:45.754 --> 59:49.586
I suggest your time would be
better employed elsewhere.

59:52.623 --> 59:55.039
I don't suppose
there's anything else

59:55.074 --> 59:57.697
that could possibly
change your mind?

59:57.732 --> 01:00:01.943
Unless you intend to march
Cary Leech through our door,

01:00:01.977 --> 01:00:04.117
I'm afraid you're
out of options.

01:00:05.015 --> 01:00:06.568
Cary Leech?

01:00:06.603 --> 01:00:11.469
Child, don't pretend to
have any idea who that is.

01:00:12.125 --> 01:00:13.506
It's before your time.

01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:15.922
You mean our Cary Leech?

01:00:17.544 --> 01:00:22.619
What do you mean,
"Our Cary Leech?"

01:00:23.723 --> 01:00:26.968
You first. Show
me your Cary Leech.

01:00:27.002 --> 01:00:30.730
I am not accustomed
to taking demands.

01:00:30.765 --> 01:00:32.698
Get used to it. Show me.

01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:45.296
And the murderer
is one of you.

01:00:49.197 --> 01:00:49.991
Huh?

01:00:51.578 --> 01:00:52.787
I say!

01:00:52.821 --> 01:00:55.686
Oh, it's all quite
simple, really.

01:00:55.721 --> 01:00:57.619
Now, your late father
was left-handed,

01:00:57.654 --> 01:00:59.103
was he not Miss Fairfax?

01:00:59.138 --> 01:01:00.518
- Hm?
- Huh?

01:01:00.553 --> 01:01:03.590
Knowing that then, perhaps
you can explain to me

01:01:03.625 --> 01:01:05.247
how he could possibly have heard

01:01:05.282 --> 01:01:08.147
the huntsman's call,
Lord Shepperton?

01:01:25.095 --> 01:01:26.821
Your turn.

01:01:26.855 --> 01:01:29.306
What's this about Cary Leech?

01:01:31.964 --> 01:01:33.897
He will be
hosting the special.

01:01:35.036 --> 01:01:38.867
From here?

01:01:38.902 --> 01:01:40.041
Mm-hmm. That's right.

01:01:40.075 --> 01:01:41.559
He'll be announcing every song,

01:01:41.594 --> 01:01:44.148
telling stories from
set, meeting new fans.

01:01:44.183 --> 01:01:45.667
And so help me,

01:01:45.702 --> 01:01:48.049
that man signs everything
I put in front of him.

01:01:48.083 --> 01:01:52.570
But as for the from here part,

01:01:52.605 --> 01:01:56.333
well that's not really
up to me now, is it?

01:02:00.682 --> 01:02:03.202
I cannot believe that
you just lied in a church.

01:02:03.236 --> 01:02:04.548
I mean in a church, June.

01:02:04.582 --> 01:02:06.032
It's not a lie yet, okay?

01:02:06.067 --> 01:02:07.931
Not if we can get
Cary Leech back.

01:02:08.863 --> 01:02:11.037
June, he's bunkered somewhere.

01:02:11.072 --> 01:02:12.832
I mean off the grid
for all we know.

01:02:12.867 --> 01:02:14.420
He's probably got a
thousand-acre estate

01:02:14.454 --> 01:02:17.009
somewhere in Sun Valley that
we'll never be able to find.

01:02:17.043 --> 01:02:19.252
Well, what
addresses do we have for him?

01:02:19.287 --> 01:02:20.633
None.

01:02:20.667 --> 01:02:22.877
All correspondence goes
through his lawyer.

01:02:24.016 --> 01:02:25.914
All right, well
what's his address?

01:02:33.128 --> 01:02:35.372
His lawyer works
out of an apartment?

01:02:37.650 --> 01:02:39.376
I guess I always
kind of assumed

01:02:39.410 --> 01:02:41.102
he had a better
lawyer than this.

01:03:02.848 --> 01:03:04.677
What do you want now?

01:03:04.711 --> 01:03:05.712
Oh!

01:03:05.747 --> 01:03:08.370
Hey! Leech!

01:03:08.405 --> 01:03:10.821
Come on, open up.
What is going on?

01:03:10.856 --> 01:03:12.029
Get on in here.

01:03:23.938 --> 01:03:28.149
Right, first thing
I wanna know is,

01:03:28.183 --> 01:03:29.426
how did you find me?

01:03:30.841 --> 01:03:33.775
For years, I have battled
to preserve my anonymity,

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:38.815
yet somehow, you have penetrated
the wilyest of defenses.

01:03:39.505 --> 01:03:41.438
So lay out the trail.

01:03:41.472 --> 01:03:45.131
What gossamer thread of clues
did you follow to get here?

01:04:01.423 --> 01:04:04.633
So I'm gonna go way out on
a limb here and just assume

01:04:04.668 --> 01:04:06.877
that there was never
any big check coming.

01:04:06.912 --> 01:04:07.809
Meh.

01:04:09.569 --> 01:04:12.227
Oh, don't get too sore.

01:04:12.262 --> 01:04:14.678
I always knew your
fighting was fake.

01:04:15.921 --> 01:04:20.097
I just admired the performance.

01:04:20.132 --> 01:04:21.650
How did you even get here?

01:04:22.789 --> 01:04:24.515
I mean, the residuals
from your show must be-

01:04:24.550 --> 01:04:26.345
Not so much anymore.

01:04:27.794 --> 01:04:30.659
But I'd like to think that
what I had, I spent well.

01:04:33.110 --> 01:04:36.044
Okay.

01:04:36.079 --> 01:04:39.772
Well, um, anything to get
on the air one last time?

01:04:40.531 --> 01:04:41.774
For some of us,

01:04:41.808 --> 01:04:44.121
there's only one place
we're ever truly happy.

01:04:46.261 --> 01:04:47.400
I got nothing for you.

01:04:52.992 --> 01:04:55.201
Maybe you still do, actually.

01:04:57.514 --> 01:04:59.999
We're throwing a big
Christmas concert

01:05:00.034 --> 01:05:02.553
like the station used
to do in the old days,

01:05:02.588 --> 01:05:04.279
and we want you to host it.

01:05:05.832 --> 01:05:09.043
Oh, no. No, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

01:05:09.077 --> 01:05:11.286
No, negative. Uh-uh.

01:05:11.321 --> 01:05:13.668
Nope. Nope, nope.

01:05:13.702 --> 01:05:14.738
Nein.

01:05:14.772 --> 01:05:15.808
Why not?

01:05:17.154 --> 01:05:20.157
You think I'm showing my face
around that studio of yours

01:05:20.192 --> 01:05:23.229
while that psychopath
is out there?

01:05:23.264 --> 01:05:26.025
You only just caught
me before I blew town.

01:05:26.060 --> 01:05:28.441
Find me some other PBS station

01:05:28.476 --> 01:05:32.169
that still fills time with
"The Woking Mysteries."

01:05:32.204 --> 01:05:33.964
This is to save the station.

01:05:34.758 --> 01:05:36.104
This could be big.

01:05:36.139 --> 01:05:38.072
Your big closing act.

01:05:38.106 --> 01:05:40.246
Oh, if that loon shows up,

01:05:40.281 --> 01:05:42.386
it'll be a closing
act all right.

01:05:42.421 --> 01:05:44.595
And I don't intend
to star in it.

01:05:45.734 --> 01:05:47.426
We- we'll get
the police on it.

01:05:47.460 --> 01:05:51.706
Have you never seen
a single episode of my series?

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:53.328
The bobbies are useless.

01:05:54.467 --> 01:05:56.711
How did he hear
the huntsman's call?

01:05:59.541 --> 01:06:00.404
What's that?

01:06:02.648 --> 01:06:05.030
How did he hear
the huntsman's call?

01:06:06.376 --> 01:06:07.791
I remember that one.

01:06:08.792 --> 01:06:10.414
Come on.

01:06:10.449 --> 01:06:12.969
How did he hear the
huntsman's call?

01:06:16.075 --> 01:06:16.973
How?

01:06:18.802 --> 01:06:22.564
Hmm. I'll tell you how.

01:06:23.980 --> 01:06:26.051
'Twas the moors who done it.

01:06:26.085 --> 01:06:27.707
Aye, the moors.

01:06:27.742 --> 01:06:31.056
The misty moors where
screams are swallered

01:06:31.090 --> 01:06:33.472
and murder rings clear.

01:06:33.506 --> 01:06:35.336
'Twas there you set the trap.

01:06:35.370 --> 01:06:36.371
Give him a nudge.

01:06:37.545 --> 01:06:38.718
- Okay.
- N- no. Stay.

01:06:39.857 --> 01:06:41.549
So you laid it.

01:06:41.583 --> 01:06:43.723
You laid the trap and waited.

01:06:43.758 --> 01:06:46.795
Knowing full well he'd
be done in for sure

01:06:46.830 --> 01:06:49.557
by that gouty foot of his.

01:06:49.591 --> 01:06:53.250
And once he was,
you'd lay your hands

01:06:53.285 --> 01:06:57.185
on the greatest treasure
in lower Shropshire,

01:06:57.220 --> 01:07:02.087
his mighty collection
of taxidermed hamster.

01:07:02.121 --> 01:07:03.778
- Who wrote this crap?
- Shh. Give him a nudge.

01:07:03.812 --> 01:07:05.849
Confess, sir.

01:07:05.883 --> 01:07:09.439
Confess and the magistrate
may go easy on ya.

01:07:09.473 --> 01:07:11.889
Confess and spare
the bloody wretch

01:07:11.924 --> 01:07:14.478
who now answers for your
crimes on the gallows.

01:07:14.513 --> 01:07:15.755
Are we seriously airing this?

01:07:15.790 --> 01:07:16.687
Confess!

01:07:19.414 --> 01:07:21.071
Reverend, he's getting away.

01:07:23.073 --> 01:07:24.661
Um, who's this now?

01:07:27.181 --> 01:07:29.183
The accomplice.

01:07:29.217 --> 01:07:31.461
The accomplice?

01:07:31.495 --> 01:07:32.979
Aye! The accomplice!

01:07:34.671 --> 01:07:36.293
Come on.

01:07:47.373 --> 01:07:50.100
So whom would
you say is calling?

01:07:51.170 --> 01:07:52.896
I don't believe we've met.

01:07:52.930 --> 01:07:54.208
Hi.

01:07:54.242 --> 01:07:55.450
I am the John Schroeder

01:07:55.485 --> 01:07:58.384
who just might be the
worthwhile human being.

01:07:59.558 --> 01:08:00.490
Really?

01:08:00.524 --> 01:08:02.112
Stranger things have happened.

01:08:03.251 --> 01:08:05.943
My wildest fantasies
don't get that wild.

01:08:05.978 --> 01:08:07.221
What are you here for?

01:08:07.255 --> 01:08:09.085
Because you're sure
not buying anything.

01:08:09.119 --> 01:08:10.914
I could buy you dinner.

01:08:10.948 --> 01:08:14.228
And just what do you think
you are buying along with that?

01:08:14.262 --> 01:08:16.161
Conversation, company.

01:08:16.989 --> 01:08:17.921
Come on.

01:08:17.955 --> 01:08:19.371
It's been a long time

01:08:19.405 --> 01:08:21.683
since I've had anything
other than a business dinner.

01:08:22.546 --> 01:08:23.651
A very long time.

01:08:25.618 --> 01:08:27.206
You think I trust you?

01:08:27.241 --> 01:08:28.932
The only thing
you need to trust

01:08:28.966 --> 01:08:31.417
is that I won't run
out on the check.

01:08:31.452 --> 01:08:33.109
And I am a good tipper.

01:08:34.834 --> 01:08:36.077
Come on.

01:08:36.112 --> 01:08:37.630
I've been hanging
around here long enough

01:08:37.665 --> 01:08:41.255
to know it's just you and the
younglings running the place.

01:08:41.289 --> 01:08:43.774
And before them, mostly you.

01:08:46.398 --> 01:08:47.882
Come on.

01:08:47.916 --> 01:08:50.609
Your good deeds have been
punished long enough.

01:08:50.643 --> 01:08:52.197
Let's go get us something good.

01:08:56.304 --> 01:08:57.719
The accomplice!

01:08:57.754 --> 01:08:59.169
Aye, you, sir.

01:08:59.204 --> 01:09:00.722
It was always you.

01:09:00.757 --> 01:09:03.346
You and your red right hand.

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:05.417
Oh, you thought you
had it, did you?

01:09:05.451 --> 01:09:06.901
Thought you free and clear,

01:09:06.935 --> 01:09:10.663
with that trail of clues from
here to Aberdeen.

01:09:10.698 --> 01:09:12.596
Nay, sir. Nay.

01:09:12.631 --> 01:09:14.460
And again, I say nay.

01:09:15.841 --> 01:09:19.810
Oh, justice is
visited upon ya, sir.

01:09:19.845 --> 01:09:22.779
Justice in the sight of
the parish constabulary

01:09:22.813 --> 01:09:25.471
and the Anglican parsonage.

01:09:25.506 --> 01:09:28.440
Now, open the gates
and move aside.

01:09:29.234 --> 01:09:30.718
Move aside!

01:09:40.383 --> 01:09:42.799
What a scene. What a scene.

01:09:43.696 --> 01:09:45.008
Let's do another take.

01:09:45.042 --> 01:09:47.079
Okay, as much as I'd
love to see that again,

01:09:47.113 --> 01:09:48.494
we have bigger
scenes to get done.

01:09:48.529 --> 01:09:49.875
Right. Right.

01:09:49.909 --> 01:09:52.118
What's next on the
day outta days?

01:09:52.153 --> 01:09:53.775
Um, you have to go see a nun.

01:09:57.572 --> 01:09:59.091
Uh-huh.

01:09:59.125 --> 01:10:01.438
No, Bishop, I had not heard

01:10:01.473 --> 01:10:05.166
about the buses coming
in from the convent.

01:10:05.201 --> 01:10:08.963
Um, we, we never dreamed
that Mr. Leech's presence

01:10:08.997 --> 01:10:11.793
would cause this kind
of disruption.

01:10:11.828 --> 01:10:13.485
So yes. Yes.

01:10:13.519 --> 01:10:17.523
Naturally, we will have
crowd control in place.

01:10:17.558 --> 01:10:19.042
Don't you worry.

01:10:19.076 --> 01:10:20.975
We are very aware of
how rowdy nuns can be.

01:10:21.009 --> 01:10:25.635
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:10:25.669 --> 01:10:26.981
Mm-hmm?

01:10:28.431 --> 01:10:31.227
We will get you his autograph
most discreetly. Goodbye.

01:10:32.711 --> 01:10:35.541
Okay. Crowd control,

01:10:36.749 --> 01:10:37.716
exclamation point.

01:10:41.823 --> 01:10:45.931
The concert's tomorrow, and
you're just sitting there?

01:10:47.208 --> 01:10:48.520
What else is there to do?

01:10:49.693 --> 01:10:51.108
I don't know. Something.

01:10:51.143 --> 01:10:52.455
There's always something.

01:10:53.732 --> 01:10:57.218
Something to get ahead
of, a problem to fix,

01:10:57.253 --> 01:10:58.771
something that could go better.

01:11:00.290 --> 01:11:02.016
You never did AP
classes, did you?

01:11:03.362 --> 01:11:06.192
Can we not have that
discussion again, please?

01:11:06.227 --> 01:11:07.401
Well, there's something
that they tell you

01:11:07.435 --> 01:11:09.403
when you take AP classes.

01:11:09.437 --> 01:11:12.026
"Before the big
test never cram."

01:11:13.234 --> 01:11:14.131
Really?

01:11:14.166 --> 01:11:15.063
Oh, really.

01:11:16.168 --> 01:11:17.687
Yeah, those tests
were pretty big

01:11:17.721 --> 01:11:20.206
so if you didn't know the
material the night before,

01:11:20.241 --> 01:11:23.520
one long night of cramming
wouldn't help one bit.

01:11:24.866 --> 01:11:28.594
And you, June, just put
together one heck of a project.

01:11:29.423 --> 01:11:30.320
A really big one.

01:11:36.222 --> 01:11:40.054
Okay, so if you didn't
cram before the big test,

01:11:40.951 --> 01:11:41.952
then what'd you do?

01:11:44.092 --> 01:11:45.853
Put it outta your mind.

01:11:45.887 --> 01:11:47.337
Let it go for one night.

01:11:49.753 --> 01:11:50.547
Go out somewhere.

01:11:55.518 --> 01:11:59.211
Go out like, like where?

01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:04.734
You might need
some warmer clothes.

01:13:32.028 --> 01:13:35.618
So there's a human being
under that awful mustache.

01:13:35.652 --> 01:13:36.619
Who'd have thought?

01:13:38.862 --> 01:13:40.105
It doesn't bother you?

01:13:41.451 --> 01:13:44.454
I mean, there he is, being
all friendly with her.

01:13:44.489 --> 01:13:47.181
Doesn't seem he was ever
really that friendly with you.

01:13:49.217 --> 01:13:52.048
If he wants to be friendly
with her, he can go for it.

01:13:52.911 --> 01:13:54.395
I, on the other hand,

01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:56.604
am nowhere near ready to
be friendly with him yet.

01:13:58.468 --> 01:13:59.676
Is it too much to hope

01:13:59.711 --> 01:14:01.782
that maybe she's
just leading him on,

01:14:01.816 --> 01:14:04.198
you know, get a big
pledge out of him?

01:14:04.232 --> 01:14:06.614
You've been working for
Cary Leech too long.

01:14:06.649 --> 01:14:08.996
Camera's on, check's
signed. Easy peasy.

01:14:10.584 --> 01:14:11.550
Well, not my dad.

01:14:12.551 --> 01:14:14.829
He always gets
something for his money.

01:14:14.864 --> 01:14:17.556
Well, that was the
Outsider they were in.

01:14:17.591 --> 01:14:19.524
Definitely not fast food.

01:14:19.558 --> 01:14:20.939
For a nice evening,

01:14:20.973 --> 01:14:22.492
he'd call that a good price.

01:14:24.321 --> 01:14:27.014
Has he ever paid for
something and not gotten it?

01:14:27.048 --> 01:14:27.946
Like ever?

01:14:29.085 --> 01:14:31.570
Hmm. He paid $3
million for me.

01:14:33.261 --> 01:14:36.575
Yeah. Yeah,
you heard that right.

01:14:36.610 --> 01:14:39.129
$3 million to avoid
joint custody.

01:14:40.545 --> 01:14:44.065
Well, what in the world
did he not get from that?

01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:47.379
Um, I don't know.

01:14:48.829 --> 01:14:51.452
All I've ever brought
him is disappointment,

01:14:51.487 --> 01:14:55.283
distraction, annoyance,
the list goes on.

01:14:55.318 --> 01:14:56.940
Well, he's a fool.

01:14:56.975 --> 01:14:58.424
You hear me?

01:14:58.459 --> 01:15:00.392
He got the bargain of a century.

01:15:00.426 --> 01:15:01.600
Okay?

01:15:01.635 --> 01:15:04.292
$3 million for another
10 years with you.

01:15:05.431 --> 01:15:07.710
Gosh, I would've paid
so much more than that.

01:15:07.744 --> 01:15:10.160
- Shut up.
- I mean it.

01:15:10.195 --> 01:15:12.853
I've watched you
and you are amazing.

01:15:12.887 --> 01:15:14.130
Simply amazing.

01:15:14.924 --> 01:15:16.097
Just stop.

01:15:16.132 --> 01:15:17.409
What?

01:15:17.443 --> 01:15:19.618
Hasn't anyone ever
told you that?

01:15:19.653 --> 01:15:20.516
Anyone at all?

01:15:21.655 --> 01:15:24.934
Because got news
for ya: it's true.

01:15:26.383 --> 01:15:28.972
I would've paid that much
for 10 more days with you.

01:15:29.007 --> 01:15:32.424
10 minutes. Literally
anytime at all.

01:15:32.458 --> 01:15:33.494
I'd take that deal.

01:15:35.358 --> 01:15:36.221
Declan.

01:15:40.225 --> 01:15:41.364
Okay! Uh!

01:15:41.398 --> 01:15:42.607
It's getting really late.

01:15:42.641 --> 01:15:43.677
We, we gotta go.

01:15:43.711 --> 01:15:45.161
Uh, g- go where?

01:15:45.195 --> 01:15:46.921
Final exam's
tomorrow. Remember?

01:15:46.956 --> 01:15:48.578
We gotta gotta get lots of rest.

01:15:48.613 --> 01:15:50.649
Come on, let's go. Here we go.

01:15:50.684 --> 01:15:53.307
- Let's go.
- I'm coming. Okay.

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:03.420
Aubur-general-music-director.

01:16:03.455 --> 01:16:07.701
Not conductor, director.
Yes, we have to get it right.

01:16:07.735 --> 01:16:10.393
June, first violin
says that the sanctuary

01:16:10.427 --> 01:16:12.360
is three degrees too cold.

01:16:12.395 --> 01:16:14.431
Tell him we're heating it up.

01:16:14.466 --> 01:16:16.192
Can't heat a building
this big that fast.

01:16:16.226 --> 01:16:17.434
So just tell him that

01:16:17.469 --> 01:16:18.401
and by the time he
thinks of it again,

01:16:18.435 --> 01:16:20.230
he'll have adjusted.

01:16:20.265 --> 01:16:21.473
What? No.

01:16:21.507 --> 01:16:23.613
Nuns do not get
priority seating.

01:16:25.063 --> 01:16:28.169
Hey, hey! Red lights
on the woodwinds not purple.

01:16:28.204 --> 01:16:29.585
It's Christmas. Remember?

01:16:30.689 --> 01:16:32.001
I do not care how
scary they are.

01:16:32.035 --> 01:16:34.037
Nuns do not get
priority seating.

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:37.006
Just bring him around
during intermission.

01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:38.594
We'll do an extra
meet and greet.

01:16:38.628 --> 01:16:40.423
Trust me. He'll agree to it.

01:16:40.457 --> 01:16:41.286
Circuit panels.

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:42.977
Geez, Claire.

01:16:43.012 --> 01:16:44.358
What now?

01:16:44.392 --> 01:16:46.532
Well, the church
caretaker's a little concerned

01:16:46.567 --> 01:16:49.397
about everything we're plugging
into his circuit panels.

01:16:50.536 --> 01:16:53.091
For the last time, we
have run the numbers.

01:16:53.125 --> 01:16:56.335
Everything is fine as long as
nobody plugs in anything else.

01:16:56.370 --> 01:16:59.753
Caretaker says those cords
are running pretty warm.

01:16:59.787 --> 01:17:01.547
Call it free heating.

01:17:02.479 --> 01:17:03.549
What is all this?

01:17:03.584 --> 01:17:07.830
This: fan mail from nuns.

01:17:09.659 --> 01:17:10.556
Claire. Ugh.

01:17:15.838 --> 01:17:17.218
Oh, is that more
for me to sign?

01:17:17.253 --> 01:17:19.117
No, not now.
We're on in three.

01:17:19.151 --> 01:17:21.809
Declan, camera three is
getting the closeups. Not two.

01:17:21.844 --> 01:17:23.086
Come on. Get 'em sorted.

01:17:25.433 --> 01:17:27.297
Oh, I can't wait
till this is over.

01:17:28.471 --> 01:17:30.507
Well, June, if you
weren't doing this,

01:17:30.542 --> 01:17:32.648
what would you be doing?

01:17:32.682 --> 01:17:35.512
Probably having a nice quiet
night before Christmas Eve.

01:17:35.547 --> 01:17:38.101
Where's
the fun in that?

01:17:40.621 --> 01:17:43.141
I know, I, I can see
you're stressed out.

01:17:43.175 --> 01:17:46.109
But June, do you really
think you'd be happy

01:17:46.144 --> 01:17:49.423
if somehow you were being
prevented from doing this?

01:17:49.457 --> 01:17:51.943
If you never even
had the choice.

01:17:54.462 --> 01:17:56.188
You'd be miserable,
wouldn't you?

01:17:56.223 --> 01:17:57.742
Wouldn't you?

01:17:57.776 --> 01:18:00.917
You'd be miserable if you
never even had the chance.

01:18:05.128 --> 01:18:06.026
Yeah?

01:18:10.996 --> 01:18:12.722
We're on in two. We gotta go.

01:18:12.757 --> 01:18:14.828
Also, you're doing a meet
and greet during remission.

01:18:14.862 --> 01:18:16.761
Meet and greet?
That means pictures.

01:18:16.795 --> 01:18:18.210
- I- I better-
- Come on!

01:18:18.245 --> 01:18:19.418
Just come on. Come on.

01:18:21.282 --> 01:18:22.249
June, where's our star?

01:18:22.283 --> 01:18:23.664
Uh, he's right behind me.

01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:25.562
He's right behind... Cary!

01:18:25.597 --> 01:18:26.598
Coming. Coming.

01:18:26.632 --> 01:18:27.979
I just had to make sure that-

01:18:28.013 --> 01:18:29.497
No more taking care of.

01:18:29.532 --> 01:18:31.085
- On your mark first position.
- I didn't know

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:32.293
there was a meet and greet.

01:18:32.328 --> 01:18:33.881
I had to make sure that
my phone was ready-

01:18:33.916 --> 01:18:36.021
On your mark.

01:18:36.056 --> 01:18:36.988
Okay, quiet everyone.

01:18:37.022 --> 01:18:38.092
Hold for countdown.

01:18:39.059 --> 01:18:40.198
Everybody good? Okay.

01:18:41.130 --> 01:18:43.235
Live on air in 10.

01:18:43.270 --> 01:18:44.581
What? No, it's fine.

01:18:44.616 --> 01:18:45.410
Nine.

01:18:45.444 --> 01:18:46.514
No, no.

01:18:46.549 --> 01:18:47.584
Everything's
calibrated. It's fine.

01:18:47.619 --> 01:18:49.000
- Eight.
- Electrical meter.

01:18:49.034 --> 01:18:50.380
What electrical meter?

01:18:50.415 --> 01:18:51.588
Seven.

01:18:51.623 --> 01:18:52.797
No, there's,
it's not possible.

01:18:52.831 --> 01:18:53.936
There's nothing else
on that circuit.

01:18:53.970 --> 01:18:55.385
Six.

01:18:55.420 --> 01:18:56.421
I- I said there's nothing
else on that circuit.

01:19:00.701 --> 01:19:02.082
Check all the circuits.

01:19:02.116 --> 01:19:03.911
Ch- check all the circuits now.

01:19:18.512 --> 01:19:23.034
No!

01:19:39.844 --> 01:19:41.259
Hello?

01:19:42.398 --> 01:19:43.813
Anyone?

01:19:45.090 --> 01:19:45.953
Anyone at all?

01:19:53.478 --> 01:19:54.548
Anyone?

01:19:56.688 --> 01:19:57.585
Anyone at-

01:19:57.620 --> 01:19:58.517
Oh! Ugh!

01:20:00.174 --> 01:20:03.937
You just had to
plug in your phone.

01:20:03.971 --> 01:20:06.077
Oh my gosh. Is it okay?

01:20:06.111 --> 01:20:08.010
I have so many pictures on that.

01:20:10.081 --> 01:20:13.843
Um, I guess it's
not that important.

01:20:15.258 --> 01:20:16.673
Reset for take two?

01:20:18.710 --> 01:20:20.677
There is no take two.

01:20:20.712 --> 01:20:21.609
What? Uh...

01:20:23.301 --> 01:20:25.993
Oh, um,

01:20:27.581 --> 01:20:30.964
so anything I can do?

01:20:33.414 --> 01:20:37.211
Kids, uh, I don't want this

01:20:37.246 --> 01:20:39.282
to be the last thing
the station ever does.

01:20:39.317 --> 01:20:44.253
Can't we think of something?

01:21:28.124 --> 01:21:32.025
Live on air in three, two...

01:21:35.649 --> 01:21:36.546
Ah.

01:21:38.859 --> 01:21:41.241
Hello, friends of KPRP.

01:21:42.656 --> 01:21:46.729
I'm afraid I bring news
of disappointment tonight.

01:21:46.763 --> 01:21:50.215
Our Christmas
concert cannot go on

01:21:50.250 --> 01:21:53.598
as scheduled and
planned.

01:21:53.632 --> 01:21:56.463
We're very sorry to
have let you down.

01:21:58.085 --> 01:21:58.879
Um,

01:22:00.881 --> 01:22:05.575
since there won't
be a broadcast,

01:22:05.610 --> 01:22:08.475
there won't be any
pledge drive either.

01:22:09.855 --> 01:22:13.963
Anyone who wants to contribute
can do so on our website.

01:22:14.826 --> 01:22:18.312
But we expect that this will be

01:22:18.347 --> 01:22:22.627
KPRP's last broadcast.

01:22:24.422 --> 01:22:29.427
We want to thank you for
supporting us for 47 years.

01:22:32.533 --> 01:22:37.331
For half a century we
have brought you our best.

01:22:37.366 --> 01:22:39.471
And

01:22:41.094 --> 01:22:44.062
I guess we all knew it
couldn't last forever.

01:22:44.097 --> 01:22:48.480
So I'm Cary Leech,

01:22:48.515 --> 01:22:53.554
on behalf of everyone here
from KPRP, signing off.

01:22:57.248 --> 01:23:00.665
It has been our privilege.

June?

01:24:41.145 --> 01:24:42.560
Hey, Dad.

01:24:42.594 --> 01:24:43.492
What is it?

01:24:44.734 --> 01:24:46.115
It must be almost midnight.

01:24:47.082 --> 01:24:48.255
This won't take long.

01:24:50.430 --> 01:24:51.810
You've won.

01:24:53.398 --> 01:24:54.951
I've what?

01:24:54.986 --> 01:24:55.883
You've won.

01:24:57.851 --> 01:24:58.748
You were right.

01:25:00.198 --> 01:25:01.751
So just do what you do best.

01:25:01.786 --> 01:25:03.270
Sign a check.

01:25:03.305 --> 01:25:06.066
I'll be at a desk working
for you by morning.

01:25:06.101 --> 01:25:07.688
What are you talking about?

01:25:07.723 --> 01:25:10.898
KPRP. They're
still taking pledges.

01:25:10.933 --> 01:25:12.141
So?

01:25:12.176 --> 01:25:13.798
So make one. And
I'm yours again.

01:25:14.937 --> 01:25:17.284
Just make it a big one.

01:25:17.319 --> 01:25:18.596
You want me to what now?

01:25:18.630 --> 01:25:20.563
Go to the website,
make a pledge.

01:25:20.598 --> 01:25:22.117
Just get it done already.

01:25:23.152 --> 01:25:24.878
But, but you...

01:25:24.912 --> 01:25:28.709
But what? You have trouble
taking yes for an answer now?

01:25:28.744 --> 01:25:29.986
But?

01:25:30.021 --> 01:25:31.540
Well spit it out.
What's the problem?

01:25:33.128 --> 01:25:35.509
But I don't think that's
really what you want.

01:25:35.544 --> 01:25:37.649
Don't even try to
tell me what I want.

01:25:37.684 --> 01:25:38.926
You've never had
a clue what I want

01:25:38.961 --> 01:25:41.343
so there's no reason to
think you can start now.

01:25:43.517 --> 01:25:44.932
You care about what I want,

01:25:46.002 --> 01:25:47.003
then listen to me.

01:25:48.004 --> 01:25:48.902
I just told you.

01:25:51.215 --> 01:25:52.975
I- I'll get the accountants

01:25:53.009 --> 01:25:56.358
to do that first thing tomorrow.

01:25:56.392 --> 01:25:59.050
I'll be in first
thing tomorrow.

01:26:00.465 --> 01:26:02.502
Merry Christmas, I guess.

01:26:03.848 --> 01:26:04.745
Yeah.

01:26:05.884 --> 01:26:07.092
Merry Christmas.

01:26:23.557 --> 01:26:24.662
You didn't.

01:26:26.664 --> 01:26:28.735
That's a heck of a
way to say thank you.

01:26:28.769 --> 01:26:30.771
June, I didn't want this.

01:26:30.806 --> 01:26:32.256
I don't recall asking you.

01:26:32.290 --> 01:26:34.430
Look, we, we can figure
something else out.

01:26:34.465 --> 01:26:36.052
Declan, we're out of time.

01:26:36.087 --> 01:26:37.571
Outta luck and outta favors.

01:26:38.883 --> 01:26:41.403
At least now I don't
have to find 500 PS5s.

01:26:43.508 --> 01:26:46.201
What is it you've been
telling me this whole time then?

01:26:46.235 --> 01:26:48.720
You've been acting like this
is a fate worse than death.

01:26:48.755 --> 01:26:50.205
But whenever things get hard,

01:26:50.239 --> 01:26:52.690
you just pull the rip cord
on the golden parachute, huh?

01:26:52.724 --> 01:26:54.657
You know what? Sure.

01:26:54.692 --> 01:26:56.349
Go ahead and think that.

01:26:56.383 --> 01:26:57.557
Talk yourself into it.

01:26:57.591 --> 01:26:59.041
We're so clever.
We can have it all.

01:26:59.075 --> 01:27:00.767
What was this to you? Huh?

01:27:00.801 --> 01:27:02.078
What was this job to you?

01:27:03.321 --> 01:27:04.564
Just another play thing.

01:27:05.599 --> 01:27:06.773
Just another toy plane

01:27:06.807 --> 01:27:08.292
that happens to be
someone else's grade.

01:27:08.326 --> 01:27:10.570
Do not go there. We're
not playing anymore.

01:27:10.604 --> 01:27:11.640
This wasn't just a show!

01:27:11.674 --> 01:27:13.573
Yeah, you're right. It's not.

01:27:13.607 --> 01:27:15.230
Look, if you have
faith in the team,

01:27:15.264 --> 01:27:16.714
then you stick with the team.

01:27:16.748 --> 01:27:18.198
So do you believe
in this or not?

01:27:18.233 --> 01:27:19.475
Declan, grow up.

01:27:19.510 --> 01:27:21.719
I grew up when
I was four, June.

01:27:21.753 --> 01:27:23.030
I had to.

01:27:23.065 --> 01:27:24.929
Yeah. Well I
wasn't far behind.

01:27:28.415 --> 01:27:29.278
June,

01:27:30.969 --> 01:27:32.108
stick with us.

01:27:32.971 --> 01:27:34.076
Please. Come on.

01:27:35.629 --> 01:27:36.492
We can do this.

01:27:39.392 --> 01:27:40.634
You don't have a clue.

01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:47.607
So

01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:51.473
you gonna clean out
your office or should I?

01:27:55.339 --> 01:27:57.789
You won't find anything
worth coming back for.

01:28:14.565 --> 01:28:16.221
Anything I need to know about?

01:28:17.947 --> 01:28:21.261
Yeah, we'll be shutting down

01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:23.298
the servers ourselves tonight.

01:29:28.052 --> 01:29:29.053
Um, ahem.

01:29:31.262 --> 01:29:33.402
I never did do much
with the IT people.

01:29:34.886 --> 01:29:36.198
I don't even know
where to start.

01:29:36.232 --> 01:29:37.130
It's okay.

01:29:39.719 --> 01:29:40.892
Order of operations.

01:29:42.307 --> 01:29:44.689
First we're gonna start
with the graphic station

01:29:44.724 --> 01:29:46.760
that is overlays
and lower-thirds.

01:29:46.795 --> 01:29:49.280
And then we're gonna move on
to the secondary stations.

01:29:54.319 --> 01:29:55.631
What's with this one?

01:29:57.115 --> 01:29:58.703
Uh, that's for the website.

01:29:58.738 --> 01:30:01.085
It looks like it
might be overloaded.

01:30:01.119 --> 01:30:04.502
Overloaded? As in too many
people are trying to access it?

01:30:04.537 --> 01:30:07.263
Yeah, but it, it'll redirect
through a different server.

01:30:07.298 --> 01:30:08.195
It's okay.

01:30:10.715 --> 01:30:11.958
Why is everybody
and their cousin

01:30:11.992 --> 01:30:13.615
logging onto us right now?

01:30:13.649 --> 01:30:17.446
Isn't this how we get pledges
now? Through the website?

01:30:29.803 --> 01:30:33.358
Oh-

01:30:33.393 --> 01:30:38.433
My.

01:30:42.678 --> 01:30:44.300
We are, we're saved.

01:30:45.854 --> 01:30:48.166
Declan! Look at those numbers.

01:30:49.340 --> 01:30:52.274
We're set for years.

01:30:52.308 --> 01:30:53.896
You beautiful man, you.

01:30:55.242 --> 01:30:58.591
- Oh, Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:31:23.478 --> 01:31:24.858
Welcome back, sweetie.

01:32:18.153 --> 01:32:19.637
Yes?

01:32:19.672 --> 01:32:21.328
Geez, where you
been, land of no phones?

01:32:21.363 --> 01:32:22.571
Is that your plane?

01:32:22.606 --> 01:32:23.399
Yeah. Yeah.

01:32:23.434 --> 01:32:24.815
It's my first one.

01:32:24.849 --> 01:32:26.161
A hobby shop gouged
me pretty good,

01:32:26.195 --> 01:32:27.645
day before Christmas and all.

01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:29.578
You should not be
buying things like that.

01:32:29.613 --> 01:32:32.650
My dad isn't gonna give $1
more than he absolutely has to.

01:32:32.685 --> 01:32:34.549
We don't need it.

01:32:34.583 --> 01:32:36.758
We are not taking his money.

01:32:36.792 --> 01:32:37.759
What do you mean?

01:32:37.793 --> 01:32:40.624
Pledges, June. We got pledges.

01:32:40.658 --> 01:32:43.005
Thousands and
thousands of pledges.

01:32:44.144 --> 01:32:45.870
So many, we don't even
know how many there are.

01:32:45.905 --> 01:32:48.183
It'll take us that long to get
'em off the backup servers.

01:32:48.217 --> 01:32:49.667
But the concert was a bust.

01:32:49.702 --> 01:32:51.842
And they came through anyway.

01:32:51.876 --> 01:32:52.946
You hear me, June Schroeder?

01:32:52.981 --> 01:32:55.639
We asked and they gave.

01:32:55.673 --> 01:32:57.433
The whole city wants
us to stick around.

01:32:57.468 --> 01:33:00.160
And all because one clever girl

01:33:00.195 --> 01:33:02.059
said, "Let's not pack it in.

01:33:02.093 --> 01:33:03.543
Let's go up to the bell tower

01:33:03.578 --> 01:33:06.546
and let's at least have the
decency to say goodbye."

01:33:07.927 --> 01:33:10.446
Uh, Declan, have you ever
flown one of these before?

01:33:10.481 --> 01:33:12.172
- What's up?
- Because if not,

01:33:12.207 --> 01:33:13.346
you probably don't know how

01:33:13.380 --> 01:33:14.865
to handle updraft
between city buildings.

01:33:14.899 --> 01:33:16.729
Honestly, I'm just surprised
I got this off the ground

01:33:16.763 --> 01:33:18.247
without getting arrested.

01:33:18.282 --> 01:33:20.629
Okay, well you should
probably land it quickly.

01:33:20.664 --> 01:33:21.526
Declan.

01:33:22.389 --> 01:33:23.977
Declan, go starboard.

01:33:24.012 --> 01:33:24.909
Starboard? D- d- d-

01:33:24.944 --> 01:33:26.117
Go starboard right now!

01:33:26.152 --> 01:33:27.429
'Cause, I- I- I
don't really know how-

01:33:27.463 --> 01:33:30.121
Pull up. Pull up before you...

01:33:37.922 --> 01:33:39.717
Nice going, Declan.

01:34:29.215 --> 01:34:32.805
June, I am so sorry. It's
just the updraft out there.

01:34:32.839 --> 01:34:34.289
I don't really know.

01:34:34.323 --> 01:34:35.014
And plus it, it's your dad's
building anyway and he-

01:34:50.650 --> 01:34:54.274
We will not be
needing that.

01:35:00.315 --> 01:35:02.179
Claire, honey. Spill it.

01:35:02.213 --> 01:35:03.663
What are you not telling me?

01:35:05.734 --> 01:35:06.873
No joke.

01:35:08.047 --> 01:35:10.670
Now darling, let
me pitch you this.

01:35:10.705 --> 01:35:14.191
Reverend Woking in America.

01:35:14.225 --> 01:35:17.332
We are miles from making
any of those decisions.

01:35:17.366 --> 01:35:19.127
Gotta get 'em in quick, right?

01:35:19.161 --> 01:35:24.201
So what happens is, Woking
is called out of retirement

01:35:25.478 --> 01:35:28.584
to chase down the dastardly
Flower Pot Killer.

01:35:28.619 --> 01:35:32.657
He kills entirely
with flower pots.

01:35:32.692 --> 01:35:35.764
Hmm.

01:35:37.455 --> 01:35:38.422
Producers!

01:35:39.734 --> 01:35:43.082
I've just had the most
wonderful idea for a revival.

01:35:43.116 --> 01:35:45.774
How about ideas for
rebuilding the studio?

01:35:45.809 --> 01:35:47.742
That's what we're supposed
to be working on, right?

01:35:47.776 --> 01:35:49.605
Projects like this,

01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:51.090
you've gotta get
a good lead time.

01:35:51.124 --> 01:35:53.886
Uh-huh, and how about the
lead time on those contractors?

01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:55.232
You're perfect for
that. You're a star.

01:35:55.266 --> 01:35:57.199
You can marker, right?

01:36:03.550 --> 01:36:07.037
Funny thing, nobody bothered
to clean out your desk.

01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:22.846
What
are you thinking?

01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:24.606
Get out of the road!

01:36:27.609 --> 01:36:29.266
Hey, buddy. Get out of here.

01:36:29.300 --> 01:36:30.577
Bro!

01:36:48.216 --> 01:36:51.012
Wow.

01:36:51.046 --> 01:36:52.323
Someone's getting in the spirit.

01:36:52.358 --> 01:36:54.429
Yeah.

01:36:55.292 --> 01:36:56.534
Claire insisted on the hat.

01:36:56.569 --> 01:36:57.950
Ah.

01:36:57.984 --> 01:36:58.985
What do you think?

01:36:59.020 --> 01:37:00.504
Oh, never looked better.

01:37:01.746 --> 01:37:02.609
Okay, yeah.

01:37:02.644 --> 01:37:05.578
Here.

01:37:05.612 --> 01:37:07.028
- Oh, thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

01:37:08.236 --> 01:37:10.238
You know, for putting
this on last minute,

01:37:10.272 --> 01:37:12.516
it is not a bad Christmas party.

01:37:12.550 --> 01:37:13.966
It's better than not bad.

01:37:14.967 --> 01:37:16.934
It's better than great.

01:37:16.969 --> 01:37:18.729
It's amazing.

01:37:18.763 --> 01:37:21.076
And you need to learn
to take some credit

01:37:21.111 --> 01:37:23.699
because you're the one who
put this whole thing together.

01:37:28.290 --> 01:37:30.120
We have a lot of
work to do, don't we?

01:37:30.154 --> 01:37:32.467
Yeah, but forget about that.

01:37:34.020 --> 01:37:39.060
For now, it's Merry
Christmas, darling.

01:37:41.890 --> 01:37:42.787
Let's fly.
