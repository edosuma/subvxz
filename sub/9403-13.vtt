00:37.239 --> 00:39.833
It's the oldest story in the world.

00:40.208 --> 00:43.541
One day you're 17 and
planning for someday...

00:44.880 --> 00:48.543
and then, quietly, and without
you ever really noticing...

00:48.884 --> 00:50.909
someday is today.

00:51.853 --> 00:54.219
And then someday is yesterday.

00:55.424 --> 00:57.517
And this is your life.

01:08.170 --> 01:10.968
If you had a friend you
knew you'd never see again...

01:11.807 --> 01:13.798
what would you say?

01:14.342 --> 01:18.073
If you could do one last
thing for someone you love...

01:18.413 --> 01:20.074
what would it be?

01:20.782 --> 01:22.613
Say it.

01:22.884 --> 01:24.545
Do it.

01:25.087 --> 01:26.816
Don't wait.

01:28.490 --> 01:31.015
Nothing lasts forever.

01:31.193 --> 01:34.492
And cut. That's great.
Good work, everyone.

01:35.330 --> 01:36.422
Let's move on.

02:16.338 --> 02:19.774
"Nathan and I will be together again."

02:22.244 --> 02:27.045
"I will live in a big house with
a beautiful son and daughter."

02:27.215 --> 02:28.546
Oh.

02:30.886 --> 02:33.150
"I'll find bigfoot."

02:33.321 --> 02:34.481
There's still time for that.

02:43.732 --> 02:45.199
Dude.

02:48.336 --> 02:50.964
Chris Keller is on the lam.

03:17.532 --> 03:18.999
Unh, come here.

04:31.740 --> 04:33.605
Well, hello, everybody.

04:33.775 --> 04:35.640
Hi, Haley.

04:35.810 --> 04:36.834
Love that.

04:37.012 --> 04:39.845
Hey, let's hear it one
more time for Blind Pilot.

04:42.851 --> 04:46.116
As most of you know, tonight is
a very special night for us...

04:46.488 --> 04:50.857
so I'd like to take a moment
to thank you all for being here.

04:51.026 --> 04:55.326
The time that we've spent together
over the years has meant so much...

04:55.497 --> 04:58.523
and without you, we
would not be here tonight.

04:58.700 --> 04:59.997
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

05:02.604 --> 05:04.834
This night is yours. This night is ours.

05:05.006 --> 05:08.305
And it's full of all kinds of surprises.

05:13.149 --> 05:16.983
- Dude, you can't surprise a guy like that.
- I'm sorry.

05:17.320 --> 05:20.448
- What's with the beard, anyway?
- I told you, I'm on the lam.

05:20.623 --> 05:22.784
- From who?
- From professional killers.

05:22.959 --> 05:25.450
I've been laying low for months.
Didn't you notice I was gone?

05:25.628 --> 05:28.256
I just thought you were
on tour or something.

05:28.431 --> 05:30.729
On tour? Dude, I'm a fugitive.

05:30.900 --> 05:32.595
They arrested everybody, Chris.

05:32.769 --> 05:35.602
Man, it's been done for a long time now.

05:36.339 --> 05:37.863
What?

05:39.008 --> 05:40.498
You could have called me.

05:40.844 --> 05:43.244
When Haley sees me, she's
not gonna know who I am...

05:43.413 --> 05:46.849
so you should probably just tell
her I'm an old friend or something.

05:47.083 --> 05:50.018
- I'll tell her you're a bum who was hungry.
- Cool.

05:50.186 --> 05:51.778
Actually, I am kind of hungry.

05:57.527 --> 05:58.551
Chris.

05:58.728 --> 06:01.754
Whoa, why are you
hugging a stranger, lady?

06:02.232 --> 06:04.860
Thank you for helping
to bring Nathan home.

06:05.034 --> 06:07.434
You're welcome. Anything for you.

06:07.837 --> 06:11.773
I can't believe I didn't get to thank
you before you left on tour, heh.

06:12.375 --> 06:14.206
Um...

06:17.547 --> 06:19.981
I was on the lam.

06:29.125 --> 06:33.084
- You okay?
- It's from Dan Scott's estate. It's a check.

06:33.763 --> 06:35.458
Why?

06:40.169 --> 06:43.138
- Marvin, this is for $500,000.
- I know.

06:43.306 --> 06:44.933
- Again, why?
- I don't know.

06:45.108 --> 06:47.235
Well, what does the note say?

06:49.479 --> 06:53.745
It says, "What you do matters."

07:20.209 --> 07:21.767
Wow.

07:27.850 --> 07:29.818
Looks pretty good, huh?

07:31.487 --> 07:34.012
It's like a time capsule.

07:35.325 --> 07:40.024
I could tell you stories about
nights spent in this room.

07:40.196 --> 07:41.493
I'll bet.

07:41.798 --> 07:44.323
Easy, pervy.

07:44.701 --> 07:47.568
I did a lot of growing up in here.

07:47.770 --> 07:50.432
Wishing and dreaming.

07:51.307 --> 07:54.401
Figuring out who we
were gonna be, you know?

07:56.913 --> 07:58.574
Check it out.

08:06.356 --> 08:08.551
Your boyfriend wish lists.

08:08.725 --> 08:11.353
I kind of had to bump
Peyton's dad off the list.

08:11.527 --> 08:12.926
Yeah.

08:16.799 --> 08:19.233
You are doing so great.

08:19.402 --> 08:21.336
I'm so proud of you.

08:21.504 --> 08:23.631
I'm proud of you too.

08:23.806 --> 08:26.707
Those nights you were trying to
figure out who you're gonna be?

08:27.076 --> 08:31.342
However you got there,
whatever it took, you made it.

08:31.514 --> 08:34.278

the girl you became.

Remember where you were
the night this place opened?

09:23.166 --> 09:28.297
Yeah, uh, Brooke got drunk, I took her
home, and then Felix got all the credit.

09:28.604 --> 09:30.731
- Who?
- Doesn't matter.

09:30.907 --> 09:34.070
Well, uh, speaking of
getting drunk, try this.

09:34.477 --> 09:36.411
You forget I worked here. No, thank you.

09:37.013 --> 09:39.982
- It's my 10th anniversary shot, man.
- Damn, she's good.

09:40.149 --> 09:43.175
Hey, man, there's a super-powerful
A and R guy here and I need a drink.

09:43.352 --> 09:45.445
Oh, done.

09:48.424 --> 09:50.551
- Never do that again.
- Ow.

09:50.726 --> 09:53.388
That tasted like the devil's ass.

09:54.397 --> 09:57.127
All right. A and R guy. You
can do this, Chris Keller.

10:01.037 --> 10:03.301
- Hey.
- Hey, Clay Evans. How you feeling?

10:03.473 --> 10:05.941
Good. Knock on wood. Chase.

10:06.609 --> 10:08.440
Tenth anniversary shot.

10:12.415 --> 10:15.316
- Oh, come on.
- Awful.

10:17.553 --> 10:19.544
Hey, Wolverine, you got a second?

10:20.456 --> 10:22.014
Okay.

10:24.994 --> 10:27.929
So listen, buddy, you know
Quinn and I are getting married.

10:28.097 --> 10:29.860
Nice hookup on the engagement ring.

10:32.034 --> 10:33.228
Strong.

10:33.402 --> 10:35.768
Anyways, I wanted to talk
to you about something.

10:35.938 --> 10:38.839
- You're pretty happy here, right?
- Yeah.

10:39.008 --> 10:42.842
Well, you know when I wandered off and
you stayed with Grandma and Grandpa?

10:43.279 --> 10:47.306
Well, the state, they kind
of gave them custody of you...

10:47.483 --> 10:50.884
and I just said "custody" to a 6-year-old.

10:52.088 --> 10:53.715
Uh...

10:54.457 --> 10:56.482
How come you're acting so weird?

10:57.793 --> 11:00.557
Because I'm a weird dude. An odd duck.

11:00.730 --> 11:02.220
You'd be a funny duck.

11:03.599 --> 11:06.227
When this funny duck was gone,
your grandma and grandma...

11:06.402 --> 11:08.870
became your mom and dad,
until they could find him.

11:09.038 --> 11:12.235
Right. But now that I'm back, I was
wondering what you think about...

11:12.408 --> 11:16.037
me being your dad again? I mean, for good.

11:16.979 --> 11:19.948
You're already my dad, Dad.

11:22.785 --> 11:25.379

12:15.938 --> 12:17.803
- Heard you were on the lam.
- I was.

12:17.974 --> 12:21.501
Unnecessary, I'm told, but
does anyone text Chris Keller?

12:21.677 --> 12:22.803
Apparently not.

12:22.979 --> 12:26.608
Hey, Nate, listen, I'm
sorry to hear about your dad.

12:27.016 --> 12:29.644
Yeah. I appreciate that, man.

12:31.187 --> 12:33.678
Anyway, uh, I didn't get
a chance to say thank you...

12:33.856 --> 12:36.188
so this is just a small
way of saying it now.

12:36.359 --> 12:39.123
- Open it up.
- What?

12:39.629 --> 12:42.097
No way, dude.

12:42.265 --> 12:45.462
This looks just like the guitar I
sold to get Haley her masters back.

12:45.635 --> 12:47.762
Well, it's not just like the guitar.

12:47.937 --> 12:49.131
It is the guitar.

12:50.306 --> 12:51.830
What?

12:52.008 --> 12:53.737
You found Haley James?

12:53.909 --> 12:54.933
Oh.

12:55.544 --> 12:57.671
You named your guitar after my wife?

12:58.748 --> 13:02.707
No, no. Um, I named
it after the porn star.

13:02.885 --> 13:04.944
This is... wow, come here.

13:05.121 --> 13:06.145
- Whoa.
- Ha, ha.

13:06.322 --> 13:08.882
- All right. Okay. All right.
- Yeah.

13:09.058 --> 13:10.218
You're welcome.

13:10.393 --> 13:14.625
Hey, good luck tonight. I heard there's
some big-shot label guy here, so...

13:14.797 --> 13:17.357
Yeah. Frank Parks. Could be a big night.

13:17.933 --> 13:19.764
It already is.

13:21.837 --> 13:22.861
Hey, Nate.

13:24.707 --> 13:26.402
I'm really glad you're okay.

13:26.575 --> 13:28.167
For Haley, I mean.

13:28.344 --> 13:30.039
Thanks.

13:30.913 --> 13:32.972
Hey, do you remember
the first time we met?

13:33.149 --> 13:35.583
It was right here, like, 10 years ago.

13:36.152 --> 13:38.586
It's been all downhill from there, huh?

13:48.297 --> 13:51.789
Well, well, Chris Keller usually
waits until after his show...

13:51.967 --> 13:55.266
but I'll give you the early bird special.

14:00.309 --> 14:03.005

Frankie Parks.

14:04.480 --> 14:08.541

balladeers who sing about breakfast foods.

Hey, little boy, can I kidnap you? Oh,
wait, you've already been kidnapped.

17:39.029 --> 17:40.054
- So have you.
- Exactly.

17:42.665 --> 17:44.633
We go to say good night
and you're missing.

17:44.800 --> 17:48.133
Your mom starts freaking out. You
realize we're the Scott family, right?

17:48.304 --> 17:51.000
I sent you a text. I
just needed to practice.

17:53.042 --> 17:55.374
Okay, weird son of mine.

17:55.578 --> 17:58.674
What are you doing practicing your shot on
the Rivercourt in the middle of the night?

18:00.182 --> 18:01.548
I saw yourjersey on the
wall at the high school.

18:02.718 --> 18:05.346
- So?
- So people expect me to be good.

18:07.890 --> 18:09.517
Come here, buddy.

18:11.495 --> 18:15.793
When you were younger,
it was easy to tell you...

18:15.965 --> 18:18.900
that you can be whatever you
wanna be. Of course that's true.

18:19.335 --> 18:22.668
But you're old enough to understand
that people are gonna expect you...

18:22.838 --> 18:24.169
to be really great at sports.

18:24.473 --> 18:26.771
- Because you and Grandpa Dan were?
- That's right.

18:27.643 --> 18:30.771
Now look, the important
thing to remember...

18:30.946 --> 18:34.712
is that you don't have any
responsibility to any of those people.

18:34.883 --> 18:38.341
Not to them, not to me. You have
to find what makes you happy.

18:39.121 --> 18:41.453
Be a good man while you
chase whatever that is...

18:41.624 --> 18:44.218
but whatever it is, is up to you.

18:45.060 --> 18:46.220
I like playing sports.

18:46.662 --> 18:49.062
Thank God. That's my boy.

18:50.332 --> 18:55.292
No, but seriously, play sports for
you, not for anybody else, okay?

18:55.471 --> 18:59.202
- Right.
- All right. Let's get home.

19:00.909 --> 19:04.106
I'll have to figure out how to talk
your mom into not grounding you.

19:04.279 --> 19:07.180
Oh, maybe we could say
I was kidnapped again.

19:07.516 --> 19:09.507
Ah, It's a little played out.

19:16.525 --> 19:18.083
Hi.

19:18.560 --> 19:20.391
Good afternoon. Can I help you?

19:20.562 --> 19:22.029
Yeah, hi. My name is Clay Evans.

19:22.197 --> 19:25.826
I'm supposed to sign custody
papers today for this knucklehead.

19:27.002 --> 19:29.630
- Hi.
- Hi, cutie.

19:29.805 --> 19:33.138
That office went to lunch. Come back
in an hour, we can help you then.

19:33.308 --> 19:36.573
Okay. You're Bevin, right? I'm Quinn.
We went to high school together.

19:36.745 --> 19:38.508
Of course. Haley's sister.

19:38.681 --> 19:40.842
- How are you?
- I'm good. I just got engaged.

19:41.016 --> 19:42.950
Oh, congratulations.

19:43.118 --> 19:46.747
I was married for a while
but I really hated my husband.

19:47.256 --> 19:49.281
Anyway, one hour and
we'll fix you right up.

19:49.458 --> 19:51.688
- Good.
- Okay. Thanks.

19:56.632 --> 20:01.160
Okay, we got an hour to kill,
buddy, what do you wanna do?

20:01.570 --> 20:04.471
- What are my choices?
- You could help me plan the wedding.

20:05.708 --> 20:08.199
- Okay.
- Oh, no.

20:08.377 --> 20:11.107
What is happening to him?

20:11.280 --> 20:12.941
Oh, brother, he's fuguing.

20:13.115 --> 20:16.278
He probably has no idea who you
are or anything about weddings.

20:16.452 --> 20:18.352
- Weak.
- What's that, huh?

20:18.687 --> 20:23.818
Oh, fugue Logan wants to sneak into
court and watch crackheads get sentenced.

20:23.992 --> 20:28.588
- Cool.
- He's back. Thank God. We should go.

20:30.265 --> 20:34.031
Nice dodge on the wedding
stuff, dude. Seriously.

20:38.040 --> 20:39.769
Hey, Haley. It's me.

20:39.942 --> 20:42.604
Um, I just wanted to talk
to you about the dresses...

20:42.778 --> 20:45.474
and some ideas that I had for
the wedding, and then, um...

20:45.647 --> 20:49.048
Oh, I wanna see if we can make, like,
mini banana cream pies for every table...

20:49.218 --> 20:50.242
so, um...

20:50.419 --> 20:52.944
oh, let me get you the
name of the bakery. Hold on.

20:56.592 --> 20:58.059
Mom.

20:59.428 --> 21:00.986
You coming?

21:03.565 --> 21:05.760
It doesn't matter how you plan it.

21:05.934 --> 21:08.027
It doesn't matter how you envision it.

21:08.203 --> 21:09.795
I'll call you back.

21:09.972 --> 21:13.931
Without even knowing it, sometimes
life has a way of finding you...

21:14.109 --> 21:15.804
with exactly what you need.

21:15.978 --> 21:17.002
Come on, let's go.

21:17.179 --> 21:19.807
Or exactly who you need.

21:28.290 --> 21:31.350
Five hundred thousand dollars?
Now that's a spicy meatball.

21:31.527 --> 21:32.551
Huh?

21:32.728 --> 21:35.458
It was Jimmy's catch phrase.
Mine was "whammo kablammo."

21:35.631 --> 21:38.623
Oh, my boy was such a dork.

21:38.801 --> 21:42.760
He left a note too. It
said, "What you do matters."

21:42.938 --> 21:45.771
Yeah. What you do with half
a million dollars does matter.

21:45.941 --> 21:49.433
I thought he gave his money to charity
when he did that show in the school.

21:49.611 --> 21:54.139
He did. But Nathan said he told his lawyers
to give some of it away after he died.

21:54.716 --> 21:57.048
I remember seeing Dan not
long after I got fired...

21:57.219 --> 22:01.918
for refusing to report the rumors about
Nathan and the pregnancy allegations.

22:02.124 --> 22:05.059
I said it didn't matter that
I took a stand on the air.

22:05.227 --> 22:06.751
He said it did.

22:07.663 --> 22:09.392
That's a hell of a thank you.

22:09.565 --> 22:12.466
There's more to it than that. I
just don't know what it is yet.

22:12.634 --> 22:14.727
Maybe it has something
to do with the hallway.

22:14.903 --> 22:17.633
Two people died there that
day and you knew both of them.

22:17.940 --> 22:20.932
So did Skills. And Nathan.

22:21.743 --> 22:23.005
Why me?

22:23.612 --> 22:25.910
Because you did the right thing.

22:40.395 --> 22:43.387
- What are you doing?
- I love them.

22:43.866 --> 22:46.528
Who? The twinterns? You can't,
they're mine. Don't look.

22:46.702 --> 22:50.035
Hey, stop. Quit being so
selfish. There's two of them.

22:50.639 --> 22:53.267
Wait. They're looking.

22:53.609 --> 22:56.772
They're like robots.
Like hot ninja robots.

22:56.945 --> 23:00.005
They're not like robots. They're angels.

23:00.182 --> 23:02.309
Angels smile. You ever seen them smile?

23:02.484 --> 23:04.384
Robots don't smile.

23:05.187 --> 23:06.814
I wonder what they're like at home.

23:20.836 --> 23:22.303
Hold still.

23:24.406 --> 23:26.203
All right. Do you see them?

23:26.375 --> 23:29.003
Dude, just hold still.

23:29.211 --> 23:31.076
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

23:31.313 --> 23:32.337
I see them.

23:33.916 --> 23:36.043
- Oh, my God.
- What? Are they naked?

23:36.218 --> 23:39.585
Yes, Chris, they're naked.
They're just hanging out naked.

23:39.755 --> 23:42.223
- I knew it.
- They're not naked.

23:42.658 --> 23:44.216
They're watching a movie.

23:44.393 --> 23:45.587
What movie?

23:47.729 --> 23:49.663
It's The Notebook.

23:49.865 --> 23:51.765
Wait, one of them is crying.

23:52.301 --> 23:54.269
No, wait. They're both crying.

23:54.569 --> 23:56.093
They're not robots?

23:56.271 --> 24:00.435
Not only that, but they're like girls.

24:01.877 --> 24:04.345
Like girly girls.

24:05.948 --> 24:08.416
- Wait. They saw me.
- Chris Keller's work here is done.

24:08.583 --> 24:10.016
No.

24:10.385 --> 24:12.410
Chris, come on.

24:12.587 --> 24:13.884
Dude, wait.

24:15.223 --> 24:16.349
No.

24:28.370 --> 24:30.702
Hey. What you doing?

24:32.808 --> 24:36.244
I used to love that Karen had books
here, so I thought I'd bring it back.

24:36.411 --> 24:39.574
Oh, this is great.

24:39.748 --> 24:41.511
Speaking of bringing things back...

24:41.683 --> 24:44.083
did you hear there's a new tenant
moving in across the street?

24:44.519 --> 24:46.350
No.

24:46.521 --> 24:49.490
Um, hope they're nicer than the last one.

24:49.658 --> 24:53.059
Mm. I think they'll be okay.
Little place called Baker Man.

24:53.628 --> 24:56.495
No way. Oh, my God.

24:56.665 --> 25:00.362
- Congratulations.
- Oh, thank you.

25:00.836 --> 25:04.203
It'll be our own little corner
of the world, you and me.

25:04.506 --> 25:07.100
And my suddenly gross parents.

25:08.477 --> 25:11.275
Remember what you were doing
10 years ago when TRIC opened?

25:11.446 --> 25:13.038
Yes.

25:13.215 --> 25:15.080
I was raising money for the needy.

25:15.250 --> 25:17.150
You were raising money for yourself.

25:17.319 --> 25:20.311
Your parents had lost their
income and you wanted a new dress.

25:20.489 --> 25:22.753
You ended up selling your own blood.

25:22.924 --> 25:24.653
Not my proudest moment.

25:25.861 --> 25:27.294
Look at you now.

25:27.796 --> 25:30.356
Two businesses on the
corner of Front and Grace...

25:30.532 --> 25:32.727
and your parents, though
they may be gross...

25:32.901 --> 25:35.165
are finally acting like your parents.

25:35.337 --> 25:38.306
- I'm proud of you, Brooke Davis.
- Thank you.

25:39.241 --> 25:42.108
I like that our street is called Grace.

25:42.277 --> 25:45.644
I've never known anybody
with as much of it as you.

25:48.784 --> 25:50.547
It'll be a nice corner.

25:51.353 --> 25:53.753
It'll be our corner.

26:01.897 --> 26:03.592
Yeah.

26:05.634 --> 26:06.692
Well, well.

26:08.870 --> 26:10.997
You were saying?

26:11.773 --> 26:14.708
Fine. You're good.

26:14.876 --> 26:16.844
- And we're interested.
- I know.

26:17.012 --> 26:19.776
But I'm not. Sucks for you.

26:26.388 --> 26:28.151
You cannot help yourself, can you?

26:28.323 --> 26:31.815
Feels so good. I'm gonna hate
myself in the morning, though.

26:31.993 --> 26:34.359
Chris Keller feels like Chris
Keller's dates sometimes.

26:35.730 --> 26:39.461
You come down here to run the
label, you hire the Sisters Grimm...

26:39.634 --> 26:42.535
- you do not good work.
- Come on.

26:42.704 --> 26:46.834
What bands did you hire? None. I'm the
one that had to find our next new artist.

26:47.008 --> 26:48.839
- I gotta let you go, Chris.
- Why?

26:49.010 --> 26:52.275
Because you're the next artist I found.

26:53.115 --> 26:56.846
Your music's great.
Your live show is great.

26:57.018 --> 26:59.043
What are you running from?

26:59.221 --> 27:02.349
Well, professional
killers until this week.

27:03.258 --> 27:06.386
I don't know. I didn't
like the version of me then.

27:06.561 --> 27:07.892
The first time.

27:10.365 --> 27:13.266
- You're not that guy anymore.
- Yeah.

27:13.435 --> 27:17.997
Actually, you're still pretty much
that guy, but you're working on it.

27:18.173 --> 27:19.731
Points for that.

27:20.876 --> 27:22.138
Good talk.

27:30.085 --> 27:32.679
- Hi, everybody.
- Hi, Brooke.

27:32.854 --> 27:36.551
That never gets old. How's
everybody's night going?

27:38.994 --> 27:41.360
Well, it is about to
get a whole lot better.

27:41.530 --> 27:43.794

And for dessert...

29:10.252 --> 29:12.117
What are you up to, Nathan Scott?

29:12.721 --> 29:14.245
It's okay to have dessert first.

29:15.090 --> 29:16.648
Good.

29:28.937 --> 29:31.371
Ah, it's so beautiful, honey.

29:31.539 --> 29:35.669
No, you're beautiful. This
will just be a nice accessory.

29:36.678 --> 29:41.206
Now, don't say that you never
gave me anything because you have.

29:41.916 --> 29:43.850
You've given me an amazing life.

the next hour of your life?

30:28.930 --> 30:31.023
Well, we could get some lunch.

30:31.566 --> 30:35.297
We could get married
and then get some lunch.

30:36.671 --> 30:38.002
If you want.

30:38.573 --> 30:40.234
I thought you wanted a big wedding.

30:41.176 --> 30:43.701
Fancy dress. Banana cream pies.

30:44.079 --> 30:46.570
I just wanna be your wife...

30:46.815 --> 30:49.306
before we adopt our son.

30:58.293 --> 31:00.124
And just one more signature right here.

31:02.864 --> 31:06.698
Congratulations, Mr. And
Mrs. Evans, it's a boy.

31:47.342 --> 31:50.470
Mm, I always loved that house.

31:52.680 --> 31:53.977
It deserved better.

31:55.583 --> 31:57.517
It deserved a family.

32:00.255 --> 32:02.951
Why do people waste so much time fighting?

32:03.291 --> 32:04.690
And where does it get us?

32:13.635 --> 32:16.103
It's funny how our past frames us.

32:16.271 --> 32:20.833
How the person we used to be never
lets loose of the person we are.

32:22.076 --> 32:24.510
Past failures and disappointments...

32:24.679 --> 32:27.876
even victories take hold of us.

32:29.951 --> 32:35.048
They haunt us like ghosts
or visit us like old friends.

32:36.357 --> 32:38.154
This week, we launch a new program...

32:38.326 --> 32:42.160
that will explore the world of sports
from a human-interest point of view.

32:42.330 --> 32:46.391
For a preview of that program, here's
the host, our boy, Marvin McFadden.

32:50.271 --> 32:53.968
The name Jimmy Edwards will
always mean something to this town.

32:54.142 --> 32:57.908
He's remembered as the confused
boy who took a handgun to school...

32:58.079 --> 33:00.206
and then took his own life.

33:00.381 --> 33:02.747
The name Keith Scott was
also enshrined that day...

33:02.917 --> 33:06.148
as a would-be hero
who tried to intervene.

33:06.454 --> 33:09.048
This is how time remembers them.

33:09.524 --> 33:12.015
It's not how I remember them.

33:12.594 --> 33:16.155
I knew them as friends, as did Antwon.

33:17.165 --> 33:19.258
And I knew them as sports fans.

33:20.235 --> 33:25.832
Both believed that at their best,
sports and athletes can be transcendent.

33:26.074 --> 33:28.975
They can remind us that an
underdog can still find glory...

33:29.143 --> 33:32.271
and that there might still be
magic left in David's sling.

33:34.415 --> 33:36.406
So today, I'm proud to announce...

33:36.584 --> 33:39.849
the Edwards-Scott Memorial
Scholarship Program.

33:40.655 --> 33:42.714
A scholarship program for
college-bound students...

33:42.891 --> 33:45.792
who plan to pursue any
sports-related majors.

33:45.960 --> 33:51.956
Coaches, trainers, coordinators
and, yes, broadcasters.

33:54.369 --> 33:59.602
It's not my intention that one day this
scholarship fund will erase the past...

33:59.941 --> 34:03.672
but it is my intention that
one day it might eclipse it...

34:03.845 --> 34:08.373
and remind a new generation of sports
fans that what you do matters...

34:08.550 --> 34:11.451
and how you do it matters.

34:13.554 --> 34:15.523
I'm Marvin McFadden.

34:15.690 --> 34:17.658
Whammo kablammo.

34:17.824 --> 34:19.815
That's a spicy meatball.

34:21.829 --> 34:23.489
We'll be back after this.

Almost there.

36:20.815 --> 36:23.113
Okay, open.

36:24.085 --> 36:27.213
- My old house?
- No, our new home.

36:27.388 --> 36:29.288
- What?
- Come on.

36:39.200 --> 36:40.758
What?

36:41.502 --> 36:45.871
You said this house deserved
better. That it deserved a family.

36:46.474 --> 36:49.966
Well, now it's got one. The best one.

36:54.048 --> 36:56.243
I wished for this.

36:56.918 --> 36:59.887
Right here, without even knowing it.

37:00.421 --> 37:05.791
I wished for you and our family and this.

37:07.929 --> 37:09.624
Come here.

37:11.065 --> 37:14.057
Ever since New York,
I wanted to come home.

37:14.235 --> 37:17.432
I just knew in my heart that
there was treasure here...

37:17.605 --> 37:19.072
and I found it.

37:20.475 --> 37:22.238
In our sons.

37:22.777 --> 37:24.938
In my parents.

37:25.113 --> 37:26.307
In you.

37:30.151 --> 37:34.520
This house always wanted to
be home and now it will be.

37:34.889 --> 37:36.789
Our home.

37:37.625 --> 37:39.422
Everyone should have that.

37:40.061 --> 37:42.825
A place that makes them happy.

37:43.264 --> 37:45.391
You should have that.

37:46.267 --> 37:48.758
Welcome home, Brooke Davis.

37:54.776 --> 37:56.573
Thank you.

38:01.549 --> 38:02.573
I wanna go see my room.

38:03.951 --> 38:05.213
Okay.

38:11.826 --> 38:14.021

38:16.397 --> 38:18.194
Yep. I'm not afraid anymore.

38:18.366 --> 38:22.063
Good man. All right.
You sleep tight, buddy.

38:24.205 --> 38:26.002
Night, Dad.

38:26.440 --> 38:27.930
Night, Mom.

38:28.376 --> 38:30.970
- Night, son.
- We love you.

38:41.856 --> 38:44.017
Whoa, what's that?

38:45.059 --> 38:46.959
It's a secret.

38:53.267 --> 38:56.566
Inside this box are
predictions and hopes...

38:56.737 --> 38:59.262
that I started making
when I was about your age.

38:59.774 --> 39:04.541
And Uncle Lucas did too, and
even your dad has some in here.

39:04.712 --> 39:07.772
- Really? Did they come true?
- They did.

39:07.949 --> 39:11.476
Against all odds and in the
face of all kinds of obstacles...

39:11.652 --> 39:15.019
almost every wish in here came true.

39:20.661 --> 39:22.993
This is your secret now.

39:23.831 --> 39:25.355
Your magic.

39:25.533 --> 39:27.728
So think about your wishes...

39:27.902 --> 39:30.564
use them wisely, and
only make predictions...

39:30.738 --> 39:33.935
about things you're absolutely
certain will make you happy.

39:34.108 --> 39:37.942
And most importantly, don't tell a soul.

39:38.546 --> 39:41.174
- Except your mom.
- Okay.

39:45.219 --> 39:47.449
I'm gonna break Dad's scoring title.

39:50.925 --> 39:53.655
Human beings are ambitious.

39:53.828 --> 39:59.164
We spend so much time
wanting, pursuing, wishing.

39:59.333 --> 40:03.133
For the most part, that's
okay. Ambition is good.

40:04.205 --> 40:07.140
Chasing things with integrity is good.

40:07.308 --> 40:08.900
Dreaming.

40:11.078 --> 40:15.014
As long as the chase doesn't
diminish what we already have.

40:15.182 --> 40:19.414
The goodness we take for granted,
the people we take for granted.

40:19.587 --> 40:21.851
The lives we take for granted.

40:22.189 --> 40:25.647
- Come here.
- My life is good.

40:26.894 --> 40:29.192
It's a magical place, son.

40:31.032 --> 40:34.695
I've seen that magic in your
eyes for the last nine years.

40:35.937 --> 40:41.739
There's only one Tree Hill,
Jamie Scott, and it's your home.

41:04.367 --> 41:06.892
You somewhere down memory lane?

41:07.370 --> 41:08.997
Yeah.

41:10.040 --> 41:14.773
Good. Stay there and tell me what
I should remember about this place.

41:15.011 --> 41:17.206
What made it so special?

41:18.682 --> 41:23.483
Oh, I don't know. What makes
any high school special?

41:24.120 --> 41:27.351
This is where it all
happened for the first time.

41:27.724 --> 41:31.820
The heartache and the happiness.

41:32.162 --> 41:33.993
All of it.

41:35.498 --> 41:37.932
Being in this hallway...

41:43.073 --> 41:45.200
feels like it was yesterday.

41:47.811 --> 41:50.803
I wake up sometimes and I miss it.

41:51.681 --> 41:53.842
But this is good.

41:55.085 --> 41:57.280
It's all still right here.

41:59.456 --> 42:00.718

Hales, let's go. We don't wanna be late.

45:41.277 --> 45:43.108
I'm coming. I'm coming. I'm sorry.

45:43.279 --> 45:46.806
- I'm nervous. Why am I nervous?
- You're always nervous.

45:46.983 --> 45:48.007
Oh, thank you.

46:02.198 --> 46:03.859
- Caw.
- Ha-ha-ha.

46:04.033 --> 46:06.058
Nobody says "caw," Julian.

46:06.236 --> 46:08.397
We do. We say "caw"
every week on the show.

46:08.571 --> 46:11.972
- Oh, all right, all
right. Caw. - Ha-ha-ha.

46:12.141 --> 46:13.665
- We'll see you there.
- Okay.

47:23.479 --> 47:26.004
It's the oldest story in the world.

47:26.282 --> 47:29.740
One day you're 17 and
planning for someday.

47:32.255 --> 47:35.816
And then, quietly, and without
you ever really noticing...

47:35.992 --> 47:37.289
someday is today.

47:38.661 --> 47:41.061
Then someday is yesterday.

47:43.166 --> 47:45.100
And this is your life.

47:49.138 --> 47:55.202
We spend so much time
wanting, pursuing, wishing.

47:55.912 --> 47:58.073
But ambition is good.

47:58.247 --> 48:01.978
Chasing things with integrity is good.

48:02.251 --> 48:04.082
Dreaming.

48:05.855 --> 48:08.517
If you had a friend you
knew you'd never see again...

48:08.691 --> 48:10.682
what would you say?

48:11.294 --> 48:14.422
If you could do one last
thing for someone you love...

48:14.597 --> 48:16.531
what would it be?

48:17.200 --> 48:18.633
Say it.

48:18.801 --> 48:20.166
Do it.

48:20.336 --> 48:21.963
Don't wait.

48:22.138 --> 48:24.265
Nothing lasts forever.

48:25.174 --> 48:28.041
Make a wish and place it in your heart.

48:30.046 --> 48:32.014
Anything you want.

48:32.315 --> 48:34.476
Everything you want.

48:36.319 --> 48:39.049
Do you have it? Good.

48:39.222 --> 48:41.782
Now believe it can come true.

48:43.593 --> 48:47.029
You never know where the next
miracle is gonna come from.

48:48.331 --> 48:50.322
The next memory.

48:52.235 --> 48:54.100
The next smile.

48:55.405 --> 48:57.600
The next wish come true.

49:01.911 --> 49:05.244
But if you believe that it's
right around the corner...

49:05.648 --> 49:08.446
And you open your heart and
mind to the possibility of it...

49:08.618 --> 49:10.586
to the certainty of it...

49:12.121 --> 49:15.386
You just might get the
thing you're wishing for.

49:17.794 --> 49:20.422
The world is full of magic.

49:24.600 --> 49:27.194
You just have to believe in it.

50:13.983 --> 50:15.974
So make your wish.

50:16.152 --> 50:17.881
Do you have it?

50:18.688 --> 50:20.212
Good.

50:21.624 --> 50:23.489
Now believe in it.

50:25.094 --> 50:27.562
With all your heart.
