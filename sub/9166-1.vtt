WEBVTT

04:01.989 --> 04:03.873
What is your deal?

04:05.159 --> 04:07.703
I got a big game on Friday.

04:09.330 --> 04:12.374
Look, it's no good. I need my fluids.

04:13.768 --> 04:15.144
Your fluids?

04:15.269 --> 04:16.652
Yeah.

04:19.339 --> 04:21.483
Mary Jo, I'm curious.

04:21.608 --> 04:23.959
Why would you do something like that?

04:25.513 --> 04:26.953
Why not?

04:27.081 --> 04:28.828
It's self-mutilation, really.

04:34.689 --> 04:38.234
Self-mutilate this, fluid boy.

04:53.541 --> 04:55.015
Good find, girl.

04:56.043 --> 04:57.426
Yeah.

04:58.379 --> 04:59.762
Who's that?

05:10.258 --> 05:12.608
Oh, shit. No.

05:37.952 --> 05:39.335
Slut.

05:48.362 --> 05:49.745
Andy.

05:55.036 --> 05:57.250
You want to step out for a minute?

05:59.207 --> 06:01.584
You kids shouldn't be out past curfew.

06:01.709 --> 06:06.619
Andy Effkin, toast with the most.

06:07.848 --> 06:10.926
You like our chances
against Knight's Ridge?

06:11.052 --> 06:12.428
We should do fine.

06:12.553 --> 06:15.431
Thrown for a loss.

06:15.556 --> 06:17.406
Is your arm okay for the game?

06:18.659 --> 06:21.003
- It's good.
- Offensive line up to par?

06:21.128 --> 06:24.070
Son of a bitch.

06:30.805 --> 06:32.279
Fuck.

06:32.406 --> 06:36.019
Easy, Eff. Easy, buddy.

06:37.144 --> 06:40.359
- I need my fluids.
- Give me the gun.

06:43.684 --> 06:45.101
Get out of here, now.

06:49.357 --> 06:51.207
What?

06:53.995 --> 06:55.674
You gotta be shittin' me.

06:56.964 --> 06:58.347
That's Mary Jo.

07:00.701 --> 07:05.884
Clarice, it's Cox.
We got a wet one here on the bluff.

07:25.159 --> 07:28.567
I just can't wait, Steve.

07:28.696 --> 07:30.072
To do what?

07:30.197 --> 07:34.877
To see my new room,
my new school, my new everything.

07:35.002 --> 07:36.385
Yeah, new everything.

07:38.172 --> 07:41.050
It's gonna be awesome.

07:41.175 --> 07:42.683
It's gonna be better.

07:42.810 --> 07:44.193
Way better.

07:45.246 --> 07:46.629
Come on.

08:25.152 --> 08:26.796
Looks like you're moving to Cradle Bay.

08:26.921 --> 08:30.864
- We sure are.
- Sure you'll like it here.

08:30.991 --> 08:34.707
- You'll never want to leave.
- You hear that?

09:06.160 --> 09:09.341
Hey, you. I thought
you were gonna help me.

09:11.465 --> 09:13.142
Come on.

09:13.267 --> 09:14.644
Fridge.

09:14.769 --> 09:16.152
Thank you.

09:24.311 --> 09:25.688
You all right?

09:25.813 --> 09:27.189
Yeah.

09:27.314 --> 09:31.093
Just trying to put
some of this stuff away.

09:31.218 --> 09:32.795
Nervous?

09:33.921 --> 09:35.964
- About what?
- First day at school.

09:45.433 --> 09:46.816
Dad?

10:01.615 --> 10:04.056
What are you doing, dipshit?
Don't worry about snakes in the garden...

10:04.185 --> 10:05.693
when you got spiders in your bed.

10:22.403 --> 10:24.913
"They had been so innocent
and little there.

10:25.039 --> 10:28.254
And all beyond was so unknown and great."

10:29.710 --> 10:31.921
Very good, Trent.

10:32.046 --> 10:33.756
To wit, when Pip says this...

10:33.881 --> 10:36.459
Dickens is speaking
of the joy of discovery...

10:36.584 --> 10:39.929
of newness, of change.

10:40.054 --> 10:42.097
Mr. Clark, perhaps you can relate.

10:42.223 --> 10:46.542
Mr. Clark is new to us from Chicago.
Do they read Dickens in Chicago?

10:49.763 --> 10:51.146
Dickie Atkinson.

10:52.399 --> 10:54.110
Welcome.

10:54.235 --> 10:57.279
Tell us why you're late.
Trouble with the camshaft?

10:57.404 --> 10:58.878
Like you know what one is.

10:59.006 --> 11:02.885
Somebody woke up on the wrong side
of the carburetor this morning.

11:03.010 --> 11:04.450
Peckerhead.

11:07.014 --> 11:10.226
What is...
if I may display my ignorance...

11:10.351 --> 11:13.031
a peckerhead?

11:14.188 --> 11:16.231
Why are you laughing, Whalen?

11:16.357 --> 11:18.067
Nothing, Richard.

11:18.192 --> 11:20.702
I was just thinking how ignorance kills.

11:20.828 --> 11:24.373
- What does that mean?
- Exactly.

11:25.299 --> 11:26.910
You ass-kissing little fuck!

11:28.035 --> 11:29.919
Boys!

11:34.041 --> 11:39.088
Perhaps yet another little sojourn
to the principal will serve you well?

11:41.448 --> 11:44.390
Want to know what a peckerhead is?

11:44.518 --> 11:47.733
- That's a peckerhead.
- Thank you for the clarification.

11:48.956 --> 11:52.467
Please send Principal Weathers
our hosannas!

11:57.831 --> 12:03.378
"Youth is wholly experimental."
Robert Louis Stevenson.

12:22.823 --> 12:24.206
I know.

12:43.544 --> 12:45.587
These seats taken?

12:45.713 --> 12:47.255
No. Go ahead.

12:55.889 --> 12:57.966
I am Gavin. This is U.V.

12:59.893 --> 13:01.674
I'm Steve.

13:02.796 --> 13:04.179
Munchies.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.884
U.V. Has some primo weed.

13:10.004 --> 13:13.148
We smoked a fatty during gym.

13:13.273 --> 13:16.556
Check him out. He looks almost tan.

13:18.012 --> 13:20.689
Hello, Lorna. How are you today, my dear?

13:20.814 --> 13:24.222
- Drop dead.
- Contact.

13:24.351 --> 13:28.328
- Who's that?
- That is Lorna "Love-itis" Longley.

13:28.455 --> 13:32.899
Fire of my loins, purveyor
of my every masturbatory fantasy.

13:36.363 --> 13:39.074
The entire female gender
is separated into two groups.

13:39.199 --> 13:43.108
Lorna comprises one group.
All of womankind comprises the other.

13:43.237 --> 13:44.916
You ever take her out?

13:47.241 --> 13:51.954
Alas, Lorna is largely untouchable
for someone of my social standing.

13:52.079 --> 13:53.489
What do you mean?

13:53.614 --> 13:56.727
It's a class system
here at C.B. High, Stevie Boy.

13:58.118 --> 14:00.262
Check it out.

14:00.387 --> 14:02.862
There you got your motorheads, car jocks.

14:02.990 --> 14:05.568
All the world's a gasket
and a lube job and a pack of Luckys.

14:05.693 --> 14:09.038
Music of choice: Posi-traction
overdrive, classic rock...

14:09.163 --> 14:12.041
Skynyrd, The Allmans, Bruce.

14:12.166 --> 14:14.710
Drug of choice:
Beer, Miller Genuine Draft.

14:14.835 --> 14:16.712
Keggers can't be choosers.

14:16.837 --> 14:19.051
Freaks who fix leaks.

14:20.340 --> 14:23.018
Over here you have your microgeeks...

14:23.143 --> 14:26.688
nerds, whiz kids
and various other bottom feeders.

14:26.814 --> 14:30.723
Music of choice:
The sound of an Apple PC booting up.

14:30.851 --> 14:33.495
Drug of choice: Stephen Hawking's
"A Brief History of Time"...

14:33.620 --> 14:36.061
and a cup of jasmine tea
on a Saturday night.

14:36.190 --> 14:39.068
Freaks that go squeak.

14:39.193 --> 14:41.703
Over there you have your skaters.

14:41.829 --> 14:44.239
Riffin', ragin' kids
and their ramp tramps.

14:44.364 --> 14:47.242
Baggy pants, Dickie wools,
doing 50-50 grinds...

14:47.367 --> 14:50.411
with a gnarly grab finish
on a homemade halfpipe in the woods.

14:50.537 --> 14:53.349
Music of choice:
The whack of a hacky sack.

14:53.474 --> 14:57.786
Drug of choice: Ecstasy, E-tab.
Baby, longer lovin' through science.

14:57.911 --> 14:59.761
Freaks in sneaks.

15:01.215 --> 15:04.225
Here's where it gets really nasty.

15:04.351 --> 15:07.596
Lorna runs with that group there,
the Blue Ribbons.

15:07.721 --> 15:10.366
- What's that?
- It's a community group of good kids.

15:10.491 --> 15:12.234
Have bake sales, car washes.

15:12.359 --> 15:15.104
- Kiss a lot of adult sphincter.
- Blue Robots.

15:15.229 --> 15:17.373
Here, here.

15:17.498 --> 15:21.377
Those three guys: Cradle Bay's answer
to Manson, McVeigh and O.J.

15:21.502 --> 15:24.413
Trent Whalen, Andy Effkin, Robby Stewart.

15:24.538 --> 15:28.549
I bet you didn't know that toast
came in three flavors.

15:28.675 --> 15:32.888
This group's music of choice: The hum
of perfection, the buzz of ambition.

15:33.013 --> 15:36.225
Drug of choice:
Life, the pursuit of clean living...

15:36.350 --> 15:39.161
at the expense of all who sniffle
at the hem of their gowns.

15:39.286 --> 15:41.727
Freaks, so chic.

15:43.223 --> 15:45.334
Then you got kids like me and U.V.

15:45.459 --> 15:48.469
Lames who like our metal heavy,
our Marlboros light.

15:48.595 --> 15:53.642
Music of choice: Harvester of Sorrow,
Language of the Mad.

15:55.469 --> 15:57.813
Drug of choice: What do you got?

15:57.938 --> 15:59.947
Freaks all week.

16:03.443 --> 16:06.121
That's it. Lesson over.

16:06.246 --> 16:08.891
Class dismembered.

16:09.016 --> 16:11.593
Welcome to Cradle Bay High, Stevie Boy.

16:11.718 --> 16:13.693
Welcome to my nightmare.

16:40.113 --> 16:43.226
- Why can't we help you with your math?
- Just leave me alone.

16:44.685 --> 16:46.535
Hello.

16:52.960 --> 16:54.400
Phlegm.

16:56.864 --> 17:00.910
P-H-L-E-M-G-H. Phlegm.

17:01.969 --> 17:04.346
- Wrong.
- Let me see that.

17:04.471 --> 17:08.915
- What are you two doing?
- We're having a spelling bee.

17:10.477 --> 17:12.258
My brother Allen was the best speller.

17:13.814 --> 17:16.324
- I thought your name was Steve.
- It is.

17:17.818 --> 17:21.029
Allen's my brother who died.

17:21.154 --> 17:22.931
I have a grandfather who died.

17:23.056 --> 17:24.997
Why don't we change the subject?

17:27.227 --> 17:30.237
- Pass your plate.
- Why?

17:31.298 --> 17:32.909
- You know why.
- Nathan.

17:37.337 --> 17:40.516
Shannon, do you get yelled at if you
talk about your dead grandfather?

17:40.641 --> 17:43.116
Around here people go crazy
if you talk about a dead brother.

18:10.804 --> 18:12.187
Hello?

18:15.943 --> 18:18.691
I'm here for the Mustang parts.

18:22.049 --> 18:23.523
What the fuck?

18:24.818 --> 18:26.395
What are you doing here?

18:29.489 --> 18:32.340
The troops shall set you free.

18:39.967 --> 18:41.343
What do you guys want?

18:41.468 --> 18:43.745
Sweet Dickie, we want you.

18:43.870 --> 18:45.811
We've got it for you, Richard.

18:45.939 --> 18:49.017
We've got all the winning numbers.

19:01.722 --> 19:05.334
We like to welcome all new students.
Standard procedure.

19:05.459 --> 19:09.470
As soon as Dr. Caldicott arrives,
we can begin.

19:09.596 --> 19:11.306
Doctor?

19:11.431 --> 19:14.676
He's the resident faculty fellow,
an outstanding educator.

19:14.801 --> 19:17.512
He's been with us two years now.

19:17.637 --> 19:20.015
Works with the students
in a counseling capacity.

19:20.140 --> 19:21.955
I think you'll like him.

19:24.411 --> 19:27.322
I'm sorry I'm late. Hi. Edgar Caldicott.

19:27.447 --> 19:29.888
It's nice to finally meet you.

19:30.017 --> 19:32.294
- Everything okay?
- Fine.

19:32.419 --> 19:36.164
Have you given any thought
to extracurricular activities or sports?

19:36.289 --> 19:37.966
Not really.

19:38.091 --> 19:41.837
- There's the Blue Ribbons.
- The Blue Ribbons?

19:41.962 --> 19:44.573
Yeah. They help each other
study and practice.

19:44.698 --> 19:46.909
It's a team effort.

19:47.034 --> 19:48.911
It's a motivational workshop, really.

19:49.036 --> 19:51.246
The Blue Ribboners have
truly been making the grade...

19:51.371 --> 19:53.915
and doing wonderful things
on the playing field.

19:56.710 --> 20:01.023
All of us here are aware
of the tragedy back in Chicago.

20:01.148 --> 20:04.590
- If there's anything we can do...
- I said everything's fine.

20:07.888 --> 20:12.067
Steven, we know how tough it can be.

20:12.192 --> 20:14.503
Whether or not you want
to be involved with the school...

20:14.628 --> 20:16.204
we want to be involved with you.

20:16.329 --> 20:19.942
- That's all the meeting is about.
- Okay.

20:20.067 --> 20:22.110
So go make some new friends.

21:09.516 --> 21:13.368
- Like that?
- What is it?

21:14.688 --> 21:16.898
It's bona fide jitterbug.

21:17.023 --> 21:20.568
It's my buddy, Rachel. Cook's Ridge trash.

21:20.694 --> 21:25.907
She's a great chick,
but she's Cook's Ridge trash.

21:26.032 --> 21:27.415
Come on.

21:29.870 --> 21:31.481
Dancing queen.

21:33.373 --> 21:34.983
Rachel, this is Stevie Boy.

21:35.108 --> 21:36.582
Good man.

21:36.710 --> 21:38.920
This is Rachel. Cook's ridge trash.

21:39.045 --> 21:40.428
Bite me.

21:48.889 --> 21:51.330
Wow, appropriate sparks are flying.

21:51.458 --> 21:53.335
Somebody cue the power ballad.

21:53.460 --> 21:54.843
Fail to be a tumor, Gavin.

21:57.230 --> 22:01.674
What do you say we cruise town,
chase a case...

22:01.801 --> 22:05.547
hit the bluff and drink some beer?

22:05.672 --> 22:10.018
Consecrate Stevie Boy's arrival
to this new and pathetic tank town.

22:10.143 --> 22:13.585
- You down?
- Sounds razor.

22:13.713 --> 22:15.096
Stevie Boy?

22:17.450 --> 22:19.197
Sure.

22:24.858 --> 22:28.070
Excuse me, sir. Can you help me out?

22:28.195 --> 22:30.906
- What?
- I'm trying to buy some beer.

22:31.031 --> 22:34.743
I have the money and everything,
I'm just a month from...

22:34.868 --> 22:36.911
Get off my case, kid.

22:40.040 --> 22:43.084
You know, the problem with America...

22:45.212 --> 22:48.090
is mankind's abject unwillingness...

22:48.215 --> 22:51.498
to contribute
to the delinquency of minors.

22:53.186 --> 22:55.502
That was like the tenth guy.

23:01.561 --> 23:03.604
- Chug.
- What are you doing?

23:03.730 --> 23:08.208
- Chasing. Nobody's willing.
- Yeah?

23:08.335 --> 23:11.118
Hello, Charles.
Cycle any anabolic goodies lately?

23:13.506 --> 23:16.948
- You're funny, Strick.
- Thanks. I'm here all week.

23:17.077 --> 23:21.521
A couple of us are going to the Yogurt
Shoppe later, if you want to come by.

23:21.648 --> 23:24.793
The Yogurt Shoppe? Yeah.

23:24.918 --> 23:29.635
You want to make an "active culture"
joke here or should I handle this one?

23:31.691 --> 23:34.371
- See you later.
- Bye.

23:44.037 --> 23:46.248
- What?
- What?

23:46.373 --> 23:49.985
You're actually flattered
that barn door has a thing for you?

23:50.110 --> 23:52.585
- Bullshit.
- Right.

24:01.621 --> 24:03.698
There's for the syrup.

24:03.823 --> 24:06.367
Is that the right one
for the orange juice?

24:06.493 --> 24:10.379
Where's the deodorant coupon?
It's here somewhere.

24:11.998 --> 24:15.076
- What does a hooker say after 12 hours?
- What?

24:19.105 --> 24:21.888
Clean up on aisle four.

24:41.695 --> 24:43.545
Sorry.

24:50.136 --> 24:52.577
Come here!

25:08.321 --> 25:09.698
Easy.

25:09.823 --> 25:12.298
Fuck! You Blue Ribbon shithead!

25:23.937 --> 25:26.147
What was that all about?

25:26.272 --> 25:27.882
Toxic Jock Syndrome.

25:28.007 --> 25:31.552
- You'll be fine.
- Where's my shake?

25:43.523 --> 25:46.234
What the hell would make a kid
freak out like that?

25:46.359 --> 25:50.238
It has to be steroids.
All those jocks are into it.

25:50.363 --> 25:54.075
Kelly Connor saw Andy Effkin bite
the head off a kitten in a fit of rage.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.411
- No way.
- I'm serious.

25:56.536 --> 25:58.413
I think it's bullshit, though.

25:58.538 --> 26:01.449
It is not bullshit, and it's not steroids.

26:01.574 --> 26:03.852
- Here we go.
- What?

26:03.977 --> 26:07.021
Gavin thinks some sinister force is
taking over the Cradle Bay meatheads.

26:07.147 --> 26:11.259
- You know what it is.
- A sinister force?

26:11.384 --> 26:14.861
You know, evil.
Nowhere to turn, no one to trust.

26:14.988 --> 26:18.874
- Fail to be a bitch.
- Fail to be a pucker-ass.

26:31.204 --> 26:33.952
- What?
- Nothing.

26:38.778 --> 26:40.559
Let's go!

26:47.353 --> 26:49.731
Andy killed her.

26:49.856 --> 26:52.240
Everyone's saying she ran away.

26:53.526 --> 26:56.570
I saw her dead body, but I can't prove it.

26:56.696 --> 27:00.909
- Those fuckers.
- Why didn't you go to the police?

27:01.034 --> 27:03.912
Cox was there, man.

27:04.037 --> 27:06.748
The cop didn't do shit.

27:06.873 --> 27:09.018
Fuck, nobody listens to me.

27:10.610 --> 27:13.021
Cancer Corner.

27:13.146 --> 27:16.031
Best place in the school to sneak a smoke.

27:34.334 --> 27:36.775
What are you shitbirds doing down here?

27:36.903 --> 27:40.345
- Relax, Mr. Newberry.
- You ain't supposed to be down here!

27:40.473 --> 27:43.586
This is my friend, Steve.
He's new to the Bay.

27:46.346 --> 27:48.230
Gnaw, gnaw, gnaw.

27:58.358 --> 28:00.235
Drag marks.

28:00.360 --> 28:03.505
Drag marks of a rat's tail.

28:03.630 --> 28:05.840
What have you got there?

28:05.965 --> 28:08.309
It's an "E-rat-icator."

28:08.434 --> 28:12.013
Sounds are supposed
to scare the rats away.

28:15.808 --> 28:18.920
- You hear that?
- Yeah.

28:19.045 --> 28:21.689
Scary, ain't it?

28:21.814 --> 28:25.564
Piece of crap. Doesn't work worth spit!

28:26.986 --> 28:30.531
A dollar for everything
that didn't work worth spit.

28:30.657 --> 28:35.370
Mr. Newberry has the Boo-Radley-
village-idiot-Quasimodo thing going.

28:35.495 --> 28:37.405
- Don't you?
- What?

28:37.530 --> 28:39.207
And he's currently involved...

28:39.332 --> 28:42.649
in a war against the rodent population
of Cradle Bay.

28:48.474 --> 28:50.585
Gotta fight them!

28:51.711 --> 28:53.185
Rats from the bay.

28:55.715 --> 29:00.102
Incoming! You think you can run,
but you can't hide!

29:06.793 --> 29:09.974
- A day at the master races.
- Check that out.

29:11.931 --> 29:13.280
Jesus.

29:14.801 --> 29:17.345
Is that Dickie? What is he doing?

29:18.304 --> 29:20.715
He's one of them now, bud.

29:20.840 --> 29:23.051
He's a Blue Robot.

29:23.176 --> 29:25.117
Watch and learn.

29:25.244 --> 29:27.128
What the fuck?

29:31.684 --> 29:35.593
They're peckerheads. Look at him.
He's killing his hard-on.

29:35.722 --> 29:37.398
Fore!

29:37.523 --> 29:39.868
Maybe he turned over a new leaf.

29:39.993 --> 29:43.003
I would like to own the new leaf
concession here in Cradle Bay.

29:46.566 --> 29:49.911
Did you tell Steve about the murders?

29:50.036 --> 29:51.977
Steve is a disbeliever.

29:52.105 --> 29:56.985
The mysterious disappearance of Mary Jo
Copeland and Officer Kramer? Uh-huh.

29:57.110 --> 29:59.521
This is where he accuses me
of being paranoid.

29:59.646 --> 30:04.090
"Denial" ain't just a river in Italy, bud.

30:06.519 --> 30:08.396
Check your weed, boys.

30:08.521 --> 30:11.633
- You are beige, boy.
- See you, Rachel.

30:11.758 --> 30:13.437
Bye.

30:27.507 --> 30:30.915
Here's your chocolate sundae.
Hope you guys...

30:36.549 --> 30:38.259
Can I help you?

30:38.384 --> 30:41.201
Steven, good to see you, brother.

30:43.189 --> 30:44.572
Come sit down.

30:49.562 --> 30:53.107
Steven, this is Kathy, Andy...

30:53.232 --> 30:55.443
- Tom, Randi...
- Hi.

30:55.568 --> 30:57.946
Lorna, Chug.

30:58.071 --> 31:00.748
You know Robby and Dickie.

31:00.873 --> 31:02.882
This is Steven. Sit down.

31:03.009 --> 31:05.223
Steven's new to the Bay from Chicago.

31:07.013 --> 31:10.224
- Do you like it here?
- Yeah, it's okay.

31:10.349 --> 31:13.063
You had friends in Chicago?

31:14.187 --> 31:15.627
Yeah.

31:17.457 --> 31:18.965
You can have friends here.

31:25.031 --> 31:27.575
Didn't you guys get in a fight in English?

31:27.700 --> 31:29.577
We've made peace.

31:29.702 --> 31:32.086
That's what separates us from the animals.

31:34.474 --> 31:35.584
Dirtbag alert.

31:42.048 --> 31:45.661
- I gotta talk to you.
- Easy, slick. Steven's relaxing.

31:52.225 --> 31:57.271
The Yogurt Shoppe.
What the fuck is a "shoppy"?

31:57.396 --> 31:59.574
Why don't you make like a tree and leave?

31:59.699 --> 32:02.777
Clever girl. Come on, Steve.

32:02.902 --> 32:05.719
We get in one argument,
and you go bond with these guys?

32:09.375 --> 32:11.816
What happened to you?
Did you eat too much flank steak?

32:19.519 --> 32:23.633
- Let's go.
- You don't have to go, brother.

32:27.426 --> 32:28.809
I'm not your brother.

32:38.037 --> 32:42.417
You wanted to tell me something?
Here I am. What?

32:42.542 --> 32:46.087
- They're hypnotized.
- What?

32:46.212 --> 32:51.092
Maybe not hypnotized, but brainwashed,
lobotomized, programmed.

32:51.217 --> 32:54.933
Want proof? Here. Here's proof.

32:56.722 --> 33:00.601
Look. That's Robby, Randi, Trent.

33:00.726 --> 33:02.507
They used to be my friends.

33:05.665 --> 33:08.209
Maybe they got sick of your rap.
I can relate.

33:08.334 --> 33:11.212
I thought you'd say that. That is
the purpose of tonight's excursion.

33:11.337 --> 33:14.745
After tonight,
you'll strap on a hog and be a man.

33:24.016 --> 33:27.458
It's something that benefits everybody.
The Thespian Society, for example...

33:27.587 --> 33:30.898
Blue Ribbon meeting. Every Monday.

33:31.023 --> 33:33.401
This is where the shit goes down. Listen.

33:33.526 --> 33:36.738
By conducting the bake sale
in conjunction with the pep rally...

33:36.863 --> 33:42.308
we can be selling cakes and cookies
when school spirit is at its optimum.

33:42.435 --> 33:45.821
I had no idea the evil was this pervasive.

33:46.873 --> 33:48.313
Jan, what's on your mind?

33:49.442 --> 33:52.086
This may sound strange, but...

33:52.211 --> 33:55.756
although we couldn't be more pleased
with Andrew's improved studies...

33:55.882 --> 33:59.761
he's become somewhat different...

33:59.886 --> 34:03.363
since returning from your weekend
enlightenment seminar.

34:03.489 --> 34:04.997
Different how?

34:05.124 --> 34:09.771
He seems unkind to almost everyone
outside of the club.

34:09.896 --> 34:13.174
I can understand your concern.
Let me address it.

34:13.299 --> 34:18.513
Kids being kids
have a tendency to overreact.

34:18.638 --> 34:21.181
We've found they go through
a brief period...

34:21.306 --> 34:24.217
of being, shall we say, snobby.

34:24.342 --> 34:29.389
But what it really is
is a feeling that's new to them.

34:29.514 --> 34:31.425
The feeling is pride.

34:31.550 --> 34:33.194
They're improved.

34:33.319 --> 34:38.065
When you soar with the eagles,
the pigeons below look pedestrian.

34:38.190 --> 34:41.034
- Give it a little time.
- Dork.

34:41.159 --> 34:44.071
Now, a new candidate has been nominated.

34:44.196 --> 34:46.908
His parents have been counseled
and consented.

34:47.033 --> 34:49.246
Colleen, if you will.

34:51.771 --> 34:54.246
- Male, 17 years old...
- Superstar.

34:54.373 --> 34:56.784
Suspended four times last school year.

34:56.909 --> 34:59.086
Parents feel candidate is depressed...

34:59.211 --> 35:03.291
spending too much time listening
to rock music and masturbating.

35:03.416 --> 35:06.027
- Candidate has a history of truancy...
- Poor son of a bitch.

35:06.152 --> 35:09.196
And a general lack of direction.

35:09.322 --> 35:14.369
Candidate is C-minus student,
yet has A-plus potential.

35:15.928 --> 35:17.311
All in favor?

35:21.167 --> 35:24.078
Great. February candidate confirmed.

35:24.203 --> 35:26.848
- Training to begin ASAP.
- Shit.

35:26.973 --> 35:30.151
- What?
- Join me in welcoming to our circle...

35:30.276 --> 35:32.786
Ernest and Lucille Strick...

35:32.912 --> 35:35.888
the parents of our next superstar,
Gavin Strick.

35:38.351 --> 35:41.896
They want you to join their club.
Shine them on and blow them off.

35:42.021 --> 35:44.899
- What are they gonna do?
- You still don't get it.

35:45.024 --> 35:49.070
You still think this is
about blood drives and bake sales.

35:51.197 --> 35:52.580
Wait a second.

35:53.766 --> 35:55.308
Maybe you should lay off that shit.

35:55.434 --> 35:57.245
Maybe you should eat me.

35:57.370 --> 35:59.413
Yeah.

35:59.538 --> 36:04.785
This is huge.
Why don't you see this is fucking huge?

36:04.910 --> 36:07.521
Don't fucking "Gavin" me. I'm a dead man.

36:07.646 --> 36:10.858
My parents sold me out.
You saw it. You were there.

36:10.983 --> 36:12.867
Why don't you see this?

36:14.653 --> 36:16.366
Stay at my house tonight.

36:22.495 --> 36:24.138
I have to go home.

36:24.263 --> 36:29.377
When I get there and they're waiting for
me, I'll smoke them all. You hear me?

36:29.502 --> 36:34.248
Everyone who's at my house:
Robby, Whalen, Caldicott, even my olds.

36:34.373 --> 36:36.883
- Give me the gun.
- No fucking way.

36:42.715 --> 36:45.259
- Let me have it!
- No! You're losing it!

36:45.384 --> 36:47.734
You'll wind up shooting the paperboy.

36:49.855 --> 36:52.296
- Just go home.
- Give me my fucking gun.

36:58.064 --> 36:59.845
Good night.

37:02.968 --> 37:05.148
Don't leave me alone like this!

37:10.476 --> 37:11.859
Stevie Boy?

37:13.479 --> 37:17.866
I would have smoked them all. Fuck, man.

37:49.515 --> 37:51.296
Wait a minute.

37:57.523 --> 37:59.133
- What is this?
- I don't believe...

37:59.258 --> 38:00.869
Show time.

38:08.801 --> 38:10.548
Who put the acid in my Spam?

38:25.985 --> 38:28.696
- Hello.
- What is up with this?

38:28.821 --> 38:30.531
I just want to apply myself.

38:30.656 --> 38:33.367
I think I'll get better results
on this side of the caf.

38:33.492 --> 38:36.536
Beat it, honey. This is rarefied turf.

38:36.662 --> 38:38.546
Sluts need not apply.

38:40.666 --> 38:42.049
Later.

38:54.280 --> 38:55.856
How much do I owe you?

38:55.981 --> 38:59.697
- Treat yourself.
- Indeed.

39:07.626 --> 39:11.405
- Where you going?
- I'm going to talk to Gavin.

39:11.530 --> 39:14.142
You're not wanted, Steven.
Just leave him be.

39:17.436 --> 39:18.717
Get the fuck off me.

39:20.339 --> 39:21.984
Guys, come on.

39:24.310 --> 39:25.989
What's your maladjustment?

39:38.557 --> 39:40.031
You okay?

39:47.466 --> 39:49.350
Forget it! Stop it!

39:55.574 --> 39:56.650
That's enough!

40:12.858 --> 40:14.605
What happened to you?

40:16.028 --> 40:18.674
We shall overcome, Steven.

40:20.699 --> 40:24.915
- You okay?
- Man, fantastic.

40:35.881 --> 40:37.264
You'll see.

40:55.567 --> 40:57.109
Retard.

40:58.971 --> 41:00.354
Are you okay?

41:56.228 --> 41:58.271
What are you doing here?

41:58.397 --> 42:00.941
You're not supposed to be here.

42:01.066 --> 42:04.315
- I hate the caf.
- Everybody hates the caf.

42:05.504 --> 42:07.381
They hate the ketchup.

42:07.506 --> 42:09.048
I got...

42:09.174 --> 42:11.718
That's not good.

42:14.313 --> 42:16.056
Doesn't even look like ketchup.

42:16.181 --> 42:17.558
"Slaughterhouse-Five"?

42:17.683 --> 42:20.659
What? Give me that!

42:20.786 --> 42:22.567
What the hell's the matter with you?

42:25.691 --> 42:29.737
You rats from the Bay. You rats!

42:29.862 --> 42:31.572
Rats everywhere.

42:31.697 --> 42:35.409
You kids think you know everything!
You don't know nothing!

42:35.534 --> 42:37.411
Forget the rats. It's all an act.

42:37.536 --> 42:39.747
- You don't know.
- It's all bullshit.

42:39.872 --> 42:42.416
Get away from me!

42:45.644 --> 42:47.027
Brother!

43:02.094 --> 43:03.477
Wait.

43:07.666 --> 43:09.481
Do you like Kurt Vonnegut?

43:23.449 --> 43:24.832
I don't get it.

43:27.853 --> 43:31.500
Didn't you ever want
to just disappear, lunch boy?

43:32.691 --> 43:34.074
Poof, you're gone.

43:35.461 --> 43:40.405
You'd be surprised
how interesting people become...

43:40.532 --> 43:43.417
when they think you are really stupid.

44:15.767 --> 44:19.050
- Who is it?
- Calm down, Steven.

44:23.809 --> 44:26.553
Where you going, Steven?

44:26.678 --> 44:30.223
- There's nothing to be afraid of.
- Here is the light, Steven.

44:50.202 --> 44:51.578
Hello, Steven.

44:51.703 --> 44:53.143
What are you doing here?

44:53.272 --> 44:57.056
- I'm tutoring Lindsay in Algebra.
- Where is she?

44:59.211 --> 45:02.022
- Where's my sister?
- She's upstairs sleeping.

45:02.147 --> 45:04.190
- Where are my parents?
- At a meeting.

45:04.316 --> 45:06.193
- What meeting?
- Steven, you're hurt.

45:06.318 --> 45:10.030
- I'll live.
- Let me put something on that.

45:10.155 --> 45:11.538
It's fine.

45:13.825 --> 45:15.709
Maybe you should go.

45:17.162 --> 45:18.539
I mean it.

45:18.664 --> 45:23.043
- If that's what you want.
- Yeah.

45:23.168 --> 45:25.211
Can I go to the bathroom first?

45:26.338 --> 45:28.749
Sure. It's around the corner.

45:28.874 --> 45:30.617
I know where it is.

45:30.742 --> 45:33.854
Of course you do. Everyone knows
where everything is around here.

45:33.979 --> 45:37.421
Your sister's a great kid.
She's very special.

46:31.503 --> 46:32.977
Hello, Steven.

46:35.173 --> 46:39.184
- What are you doing?
- I'm not sure really.

46:41.113 --> 46:42.496
Go home, Lorna.

46:44.082 --> 46:47.333
You don't find me slightly attractive?

46:48.226 --> 46:49.716
I find you very attractive.

46:49.816 --> 46:52.165
It's just that you're a Blue Ribbon
and I'm not.

46:52.290 --> 46:53.673
So...

46:59.131 --> 47:00.912
Wait a second.

47:04.469 --> 47:06.444
I'm not supposed to be doing this.

47:08.140 --> 47:12.744
It's bad, wrong. Wrong, bad.

47:12.844 --> 47:15.228
It's not bad. It's... Jesus Christ.

47:54.853 --> 47:59.399
I have to go home.
I have a big physics test tomorrow.

48:11.470 --> 48:13.012
After extracting the implant...

48:13.138 --> 48:16.516
I tested its integrity
to the optic nerve, and it was intact.

48:16.641 --> 48:18.616
The chip is functioning properly.

48:18.744 --> 48:22.255
But I did find that excess stimulation
to the pineal gland...

48:22.380 --> 48:25.197
caused the dopamine levels
to go through the roof.

48:27.152 --> 48:30.594
Every time one of these kids gets
a hard-on, they beat somebody with it.

48:30.722 --> 48:32.697
We could do a cingulotomy.

48:32.824 --> 48:36.069
No. Cut a craniotomy flap.
I'll get elbow deep, see what happens.

48:36.194 --> 48:38.805
- What?
- Cut the bruises out of the banana.

48:38.930 --> 48:40.807
What about her parents?

48:40.932 --> 48:45.216
Tell them she'll be missing
cheerleading practice this week.

48:48.340 --> 48:51.384
Look. Cook's Ridge trash.

48:51.510 --> 48:55.822
Once you've all settled in,
I'm sure she'll fit in just fine.

48:55.947 --> 48:58.225
- Thanks, Dr. Caldicott.
- Did you hear that, Nancy?

48:58.350 --> 49:00.200
Yeah, Mom.

49:08.627 --> 49:11.004
Come on, let's go. I gotta sell this bud.

49:11.129 --> 49:13.840
I got two customers left.

49:13.965 --> 49:17.180
If this keeps up,
I'll be the 7-Eleven guy.

49:19.304 --> 49:21.518
I'm gonna grab a smoke.

49:37.088 --> 49:40.906
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

49:47.833 --> 49:50.010
I saw you come down here, Rachel.

49:50.135 --> 49:52.053
I just want to ask you something.

50:01.313 --> 50:02.696
What do you want?

50:08.854 --> 50:11.231
I just want to know...

50:11.356 --> 50:14.139
It's me asking, not my friends.

50:17.362 --> 50:18.802
Will you go out with me?

50:23.101 --> 50:24.484
You're kidding, right?

50:26.705 --> 50:29.089
Will you, please?

50:30.876 --> 50:32.384
No, Chug, I won't.

50:32.510 --> 50:34.155
Why not?

50:36.948 --> 50:38.358
How about this?

50:38.483 --> 50:41.762
You couldn't repulse me more if you
were made out of shit and maggots!

50:41.887 --> 50:43.663
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

50:43.788 --> 50:46.700
- You want to be that way?
- Stop it. I'll scream. I swear to God.

50:46.825 --> 50:48.201
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

50:48.326 --> 50:49.903
What will happen if you do?

50:50.028 --> 50:52.272
I'm a Blue Ribbon, baby. Team captain.

50:52.397 --> 50:55.542
You're just a trashy, tattooed love doll.

50:55.667 --> 50:58.677
Come on, Rae-Rae, give up
the plate for Chug. Come on!

51:01.740 --> 51:03.089
Fuck!

51:25.530 --> 51:27.038
Stop it!

51:49.387 --> 51:50.998
What you looking at, retard?

52:08.807 --> 52:10.190
Wow.

52:13.578 --> 52:16.723
I guess I just think
you should try and fit in.

52:16.848 --> 52:19.226
We're gonna be here for a long time.

52:19.351 --> 52:21.235
You, me, Mom and Dad.

52:22.354 --> 52:23.737
And Chip and Dale.

52:28.793 --> 52:30.870
- What is this?
- What?

52:30.996 --> 52:32.937
- Where did you get this?
- I got it at school.

52:33.064 --> 52:35.847
They were handing them out.
We all got one.

52:40.472 --> 52:42.583
- Go inside.
- Why?

52:45.276 --> 52:48.684
- I said go inside!
- Spaz.

53:26.918 --> 53:30.304
- We should talk.
- Yeah.

53:32.690 --> 53:34.574
There's something you need to see.

53:45.626 --> 53:48.067
Rae, Gavin Strick here.

53:50.431 --> 53:52.315
Live and unplugged.

53:54.902 --> 53:57.912
Guess if you found this, then you know.

53:59.474 --> 54:01.718
Am I hanging with Trent and Robby...

54:01.843 --> 54:04.353
and the rest of the Robots?

54:05.680 --> 54:07.495
God, I hope not.

54:10.618 --> 54:14.497
I hit the vents tonight
when I split up with Stevie Boy.

54:14.622 --> 54:17.000
He doesn't believe.

54:17.125 --> 54:18.667
I went back to school...

54:18.793 --> 54:22.472
and I overheard Caldicott
talking to some wonk.

54:22.597 --> 54:25.573
Mentioned "Bishop Flats Eleven."

54:25.700 --> 54:29.479
Caldicott called them his children.

54:29.604 --> 54:32.348
Then he freaked out on the guy
and kicked him out of his office.

54:32.473 --> 54:34.516
So, I figure something's up with that.

54:38.279 --> 54:42.791
Keep an eye on U.V. For me,
though I doubt they'll want him.

54:42.917 --> 54:46.928
I doubt they're interested
in the pigmentally challenged.

54:47.055 --> 54:48.438
That's not their style.

54:52.226 --> 54:54.644
I have to go get paranoid.

54:56.064 --> 54:57.440
This is Gavin Strick...

54:57.565 --> 55:01.713
reporting live from The Reconstruction.

55:08.776 --> 55:10.660
I pulled this off the AMA database.

55:11.813 --> 55:13.189
Caldicott's last place of employment...

55:13.314 --> 55:16.025
was across the bay in Bishop Flats...

55:16.150 --> 55:18.000
at the Bellknop Psychiatric Facility.

55:19.153 --> 55:22.532
He spent seven years
doing neuropharmacology.

55:22.657 --> 55:24.040
Mind control.

55:28.096 --> 55:29.479
Next ferry's at 6:00.

55:32.133 --> 55:34.847
- Bishop Flats?
- You down for it?

55:42.076 --> 55:43.453
Razor.

55:43.578 --> 55:44.961
Let's go.

55:51.986 --> 55:55.372
- I miss Gavin. He's almost like a...
- A brother?

55:58.559 --> 56:00.443
Yeah, exactly.

56:08.970 --> 56:11.218
I had a brother.

56:12.974 --> 56:14.650
Sorry.

56:14.775 --> 56:19.287
His name was Allen.
He was a couple years older than me.

56:19.413 --> 56:23.094
If he had made it through his teens,
he would have been amazing.

56:24.418 --> 56:27.496
But he was always in pain.

56:31.292 --> 56:34.837
And eight months
to the day he shot himself...

56:34.962 --> 56:37.176
Dad said we were moving to Cradle Bay...

56:41.536 --> 56:44.250
where everything was gonna be all right.

56:48.709 --> 56:51.059
- I'm sorry.
- No, don't.

56:54.682 --> 56:56.122
Let's go.

57:12.500 --> 57:14.077
Maybe this isn't a good idea.

57:18.272 --> 57:19.814
Think of it as our first date.

58:19.500 --> 58:21.941
That's why my toothes are clean.

58:26.741 --> 58:28.151
Be pretty...

58:28.276 --> 58:32.322
and do it just right.

58:41.455 --> 58:43.737
Children.

58:49.230 --> 58:52.842
Meet the musical little creatures...

58:52.967 --> 58:54.851
that hide among the flowers.

59:29.970 --> 59:31.353
Shut up.

59:49.590 --> 59:51.599
Let's get out of here.

59:59.233 --> 01:00:01.117
It's Caldicott's daughter.

01:00:27.328 --> 01:00:29.505
His own daughter.

01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:32.572
How can nobody not know there's
something fucked up in Bishop Flat?

01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:35.517
Shit, his own daughter was in there.
Nobody's safe.

01:00:45.880 --> 01:00:48.591
The last ferry leaves at 11:30.

01:00:48.716 --> 01:00:50.759
Tell me you have a razor plan.

01:00:50.885 --> 01:00:55.932
- I am making this shit up as I go.
- Great.

01:01:04.565 --> 01:01:05.948
Shit.

01:01:25.252 --> 01:01:26.794
Hi, Officer Cox.

01:01:26.921 --> 01:01:28.731
Closing time, Frankie.

01:01:28.856 --> 01:01:31.133
Yeah, it's getting late.

01:01:31.258 --> 01:01:33.142
Just be cool.

01:01:37.398 --> 01:01:38.872
It's past curfew.

01:01:38.999 --> 01:01:40.883
She's driving me home.

01:01:42.903 --> 01:01:44.718
- From?
- Studying.

01:01:47.741 --> 01:01:49.556
Where are your books?

01:02:11.832 --> 01:02:15.010
- Evening, Officer.
- What are you doing?

01:02:15.135 --> 01:02:17.610
I'm getting rid of rats.

01:02:18.839 --> 01:02:23.686
The pink-eyed vermin can't see for spit.

01:02:23.811 --> 01:02:25.353
Quarter a rat.

01:02:25.479 --> 01:02:28.865
Town council gives me a quarter a rat.

01:02:30.184 --> 01:02:33.863
I'm going to be rich at this rate.
I'll be on...

01:02:33.988 --> 01:02:36.406
- "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous."
- Moron.

01:02:40.027 --> 01:02:43.305
- Where are you going?
- Can we go now?

01:02:43.430 --> 01:02:45.905
Step out of the truck, now.

01:02:51.505 --> 01:02:53.946
- What are you doing?
- Hey!

01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:58.020
Let her go! What do you want from us?

01:02:58.145 --> 01:03:00.063
Get in here.

01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:07.801
That's a big rat.

01:03:13.127 --> 01:03:17.776
Come on, get out of there!
What are you waiting for? Get!

01:03:24.705 --> 01:03:26.088
Let's get out of here.

01:03:35.883 --> 01:03:37.926
Come on, Steve.

01:03:49.096 --> 01:03:52.607
You have to trust me for now.
Do you trust me?

01:03:57.605 --> 01:03:59.147
Where are you going?

01:04:00.708 --> 01:04:03.819
I'm taking Lindsay away from here.
We're going back to Chicago.

01:04:03.944 --> 01:04:07.352
- Don't do this. You're scaring me.
- I'm scared too, Mom, believe me.

01:04:07.481 --> 01:04:10.400
Stevie, you have to know
we're here for you no matter what.

01:04:14.521 --> 01:04:17.766
- God, do you really mean that?
- Of course we do.

01:04:17.891 --> 01:04:23.239
- Then let's all go home.
- Steven, you are home.

01:04:23.364 --> 01:04:27.676
Cradle Bay is where you belong.
Here with your family.

01:04:27.801 --> 01:04:29.411
You signed me up for the program?

01:04:29.536 --> 01:04:31.977
- We want what's best for you.
- What about what I want?

01:04:32.106 --> 01:04:34.950
Look, Steven,
do you really like the way you feel?

01:04:35.075 --> 01:04:37.186
Shut the fuck up!

01:04:37.311 --> 01:04:39.821
You sold me out.

01:04:39.947 --> 01:04:42.625
- We didn't. We just want you back.
- Steven, please...

01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:44.393
My name is Steve, okay?

01:04:44.518 --> 01:04:46.698
Nobody calls me Steven except for them.

01:04:49.990 --> 01:04:52.067
Fine. Come on, Linds.

01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:08.484
May I have this dance?

01:05:08.609 --> 01:05:10.151
Where's Rachel?

01:05:10.277 --> 01:05:12.889
She's gone to an institute
of higher learning, Steven.

01:05:16.984 --> 01:05:20.267
- Help!
- Everything's under control.

01:05:21.255 --> 01:05:22.263
Who's your daddy?

01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:41.490
Respect yourself, Steven.

01:05:43.644 --> 01:05:45.528
Ice, ice, baby.

01:05:53.554 --> 01:05:55.764
It's not what you think.

01:05:55.889 --> 01:05:58.233
It's a new kind of cool.

01:05:58.358 --> 01:06:00.502
You feel better, freer.

01:06:00.627 --> 01:06:03.305
I've never felt so alive in my life.

01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:07.076
- It's humanity's sacred essence.
- A new and finer age.

01:06:07.201 --> 01:06:08.482
Go forward.

01:06:11.638 --> 01:06:13.419
Be the ball.

01:06:58.886 --> 01:07:01.030
People will know when I get out of here.

01:07:01.155 --> 01:07:03.432
That's right, they will know.

01:07:03.557 --> 01:07:06.135
They'll know because you'll be better.

01:07:08.562 --> 01:07:10.446
Adolescence is a minefield.

01:07:12.666 --> 01:07:17.110
But soon, you'll be fully equipped
to walk right through it.

01:07:17.237 --> 01:07:19.747
Yeah, straight A's and a letter jacket.

01:07:19.873 --> 01:07:21.950
And every now and then, you rape and kill.

01:07:22.075 --> 01:07:24.357
To cure cancer,
you gotta kill a few white mice.

01:07:25.612 --> 01:07:29.054
Meet the musical little creatures...

01:07:29.183 --> 01:07:30.600
that hide among the flowers.

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:35.604
That's a battle I didn't win.

01:07:38.792 --> 01:07:42.337
You'll be different.

01:07:42.462 --> 01:07:44.846
I know so much more now.

01:07:47.201 --> 01:07:50.086
She wasn't that bright to begin with.

01:07:58.846 --> 01:08:00.989
Be all that's good.

01:08:01.114 --> 01:08:03.123
Stop fooling around.

01:08:03.250 --> 01:08:05.395
Let the light in.

01:08:13.026 --> 01:08:17.379
Be excellent.
You're number one. You're an ace.

01:08:18.665 --> 01:08:20.048
Achieve.

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:29.484
You'll be okay.

01:09:53.527 --> 01:09:55.570
Going somewhere with my custard, Steven?

01:09:58.832 --> 01:10:00.272
Let's go, Chug.

01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:03.178
That's my girl you got there.

01:10:03.303 --> 01:10:05.016
I can't let you take her.

01:10:14.247 --> 01:10:15.755
Come on! Get up!

01:10:26.159 --> 01:10:29.044
Come on, Rae-Rae,
give up the plate for old Chug.

01:10:45.178 --> 01:10:46.561
Come on.

01:11:03.030 --> 01:11:05.574
- Not so fast.
- What?

01:11:05.699 --> 01:11:07.809
What's the capital of North Dakota?

01:11:07.934 --> 01:11:09.613
How the fuck should I know?

01:11:10.737 --> 01:11:12.780
Okay, you're cool. Get in.

01:11:12.906 --> 01:11:16.587
We gotta book.
Early bird ferry's in 20 minutes.

01:11:32.325 --> 01:11:34.300
Shit, man.

01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:55.928
It's time to leave mediocrity behind.

01:11:57.050 --> 01:11:58.524
Step up on the bus.

01:12:11.298 --> 01:12:12.681
What is it?

01:12:37.858 --> 01:12:40.242
Come and get it, you blue bastards!

01:12:46.366 --> 01:12:48.341
What is going on?

01:12:49.703 --> 01:12:51.746
Come on.

01:12:51.872 --> 01:12:53.756
Get them to the ferry.

01:12:55.709 --> 01:12:57.593
I'll meet you down there.

01:13:01.882 --> 01:13:02.924
Don't leave without me.

01:13:27.174 --> 01:13:29.684
- Lunch boy.
- What are you doing?

01:13:29.809 --> 01:13:35.023
We can't very well have these shitbirds...

01:13:35.148 --> 01:13:37.032
graduating and going off into the world.

01:13:37.984 --> 01:13:39.561
Maybe they can be helped.

01:13:39.686 --> 01:13:42.935
No, they can't. And neither can I.

01:13:46.326 --> 01:13:49.541
Do good things, lunch boy.

01:14:02.342 --> 01:14:05.125
Hey, teacher!

01:14:07.013 --> 01:14:08.624
Leave those kids alone!

01:14:27.334 --> 01:14:31.277
It's over, you son of a bitch.
It's finished.

01:14:31.404 --> 01:14:32.787
"Finished"?

01:14:34.674 --> 01:14:36.418
There will always be other towns...

01:14:36.543 --> 01:14:38.854
and other troubled teens...

01:14:38.979 --> 01:14:40.453
and other worried parents.

01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:42.657
Science is God.

01:15:12.946 --> 01:15:14.830
Be the ball.

01:16:05.031 --> 01:16:09.179
- What happened?
- We're the only ones left.

01:16:13.573 --> 01:16:15.457
So, what do we do now?

01:16:16.976 --> 01:16:18.860
We go home.

01:16:20.947 --> 01:16:22.421
And where's that?

01:16:25.051 --> 01:16:27.195
Wherever.

01:16:27.320 --> 01:16:29.295
Wherever we are.

01:16:33.693 --> 01:16:36.669
Appropriate sparks are flying.

01:16:38.365 --> 01:16:40.806
Somebody cue up the power ballad, man.

01:16:59.953 --> 01:17:01.696
All right now, settle down.

01:17:01.821 --> 01:17:03.830
Turn that damn thing off.

01:17:03.957 --> 01:17:06.835
Now, y'all got a new student teacher
starting today.

01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:10.004
I want you to show him a little bit
more respect than the last one.

01:17:11.398 --> 01:17:12.781
Speak of the devil.

01:17:26.746 --> 01:17:30.063
Say hello to your
new student teacher, class.

01:17:32.819 --> 01:17:34.327
They're all yours.

01:17:34.454 --> 01:17:35.894
Peckerhead.

01:17:40.727 --> 01:17:43.475
Hello, class. Welcome.

01:23:18.631 --> 01:23:21.342
Be excellent.

01:23:21.467 --> 01:23:25.183
Yes. Wonderful.

01:23:27.974 --> 01:23:32.520
Meet the musical little creatures...

01:23:32.645 --> 01:23:35.029
that hide in the flowers.

01:23:36.649 --> 01:23:38.026
Treat yourself.

01:23:38.151 --> 01:23:40.626
