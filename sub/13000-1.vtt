02:39.534 --> 02:42.504
<i>Dusty! Dusty! Dusty!</i>

03:37.884 --> 03:39.227
Let's do it!

03:50.439 --> 03:53.568
<i>When you hear twin fiddles
And a steel guitar</i>

03:56.611 --> 04:00.536
<i>You're listening to the sound
Of the American heart</i>

04:02.117 --> 04:04.870
<i>And Opry music on a Saturday night</i>

04:05.036 --> 04:08.540
<i>Brings a smile to your face
And a tear to your eye</i>

04:10.292 --> 04:13.011
<i>Sing a song about the heartland</i>

04:13.170 --> 04:16.140
<i>The only place I feel at home</i>

04:16.673 --> 04:18.971
<i>Sing about the way a good man</i>

04:19.634 --> 04:23.264
<i>Works until the daylight's gone</i>

04:24.055 --> 04:26.934
<i>Sing the rain on the
roof on a summer night</i>

04:27.100 --> 04:29.774
<i>Where they still know
wrong from right</i>

04:30.520 --> 04:33.023
<i>Sing a song about the heartland</i>

04:34.900 --> 04:37.779
<i>Sing a song about my life</i>

04:51.625 --> 04:54.299
<i>Sing a song about the heartland</i>

04:54.461 --> 04:57.385
<i>The only place I feel at home</i>

04:57.756 --> 05:00.475
<i>Sing about the way a good man</i>

05:01.009 --> 05:04.639
<i>Works until the daylight's gone</i>

05:05.388 --> 05:08.358
<i>Sing the rain on the roof
On a summer night</i>

05:08.517 --> 05:11.020
<i>Where they still know
wrong from right</i>

05:11.603 --> 05:14.356
<i>Sing a song about the heartland</i>

05:16.233 --> 05:18.486
<i>Sing a song about my life</i>

05:22.572 --> 05:23.572
<i>Hey</i>

05:51.351 --> 05:54.070
<i>All you know-it-all lovers</i>

05:54.312 --> 05:55.985
<i>Better heed some advice</i>

05:56.398 --> 06:00.744
<i>If you're bad to your baby
You better think twice</i>

06:01.486 --> 06:03.534
<i>Love don't come easy</i>

06:04.656 --> 06:06.704
<i>Love ain't blind</i>

06:09.828 --> 06:12.377
<i>You've got to show her you love her</i>

06:12.873 --> 06:14.341
<i>Morning and night</i>

06:14.791 --> 06:19.046
<i>Be there for her just
to make things right</i>

06:19.713 --> 06:25.015
<i>Make her believe
Till there ain't a doubt in her mind</i>

06:32.058 --> 06:34.561
The women sure love
him, don't they?

06:34.978 --> 06:36.730
Everybody loves him.

06:37.814 --> 06:38.986
Yeah.

06:39.941 --> 06:41.409
They sure do.

06:42.444 --> 06:44.242
<i>Tell her a lie</i>

06:44.654 --> 06:47.032
<i>Bring her red roses</i>

06:47.866 --> 06:49.834
<i>When she's blue</i>

06:50.410 --> 06:53.129
Yeah! Heh, heh. Yeah!

06:53.288 --> 06:57.589
<i>Give her the best of
What you've got to give</i>

06:57.959 --> 06:59.006
<i>You'll be together</i>

06:59.169 --> 07:01.297
Thanks for the interview, Lula.

07:01.713 --> 07:04.683
Tell Dusty I'll pick up the second
half in Shreveport, will you, please?

07:04.841 --> 07:06.809
Absolutely. Bye.

07:06.968 --> 07:08.436
<i>And she'll baby you</i>

07:11.973 --> 07:15.853
<i>Better baby your baby
With a love that's strong</i>

07:16.603 --> 07:20.699
<i>Hold her and tell her
You'll never do wrong</i>

07:20.982 --> 07:24.862
<i>Better baby your baby
'Cause if you don't</i>

07:25.820 --> 07:28.744
<i>One day your baby will be gone</i>

07:30.116 --> 07:34.166
<i>Better baby your baby
With a love that's strong</i>

07:34.871 --> 07:38.842
<i>Hold her and tell her
You'll never do wrong</i>

07:39.000 --> 07:41.128
<i>Better baby your baby</i>

07:41.461 --> 07:42.508
Look at them.

07:42.671 --> 07:46.141
He could stand there and look
cross-eyed and they'd still scream.

07:48.885 --> 07:51.684
- Did you play him my song?
- I told you I would.

07:52.180 --> 07:53.352
When?

07:54.224 --> 07:55.851
When the time is right.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.270
And when will that be?

08:01.314 --> 08:02.861
When I say.

08:05.986 --> 08:08.660
Mm. I'll be in Dusty's bus...

08:09.197 --> 08:10.995
if anybody wants me.

08:13.284 --> 08:16.709
- I can do something about that.
- Ahh!

08:18.957 --> 08:23.303
<i>You bet I'm not
Where the side walk ends</i>

08:23.628 --> 08:25.130
<i>You left a lot</i>

08:32.429 --> 08:34.102
Yeah, Dusty!

08:34.264 --> 08:36.562
<i>As long as I can last</i>

08:37.100 --> 08:41.071
<i>Whistles still blowing
But the train is gone</i>

08:42.022 --> 08:45.401
<i>Ain't no wheels gonna take me
From my home</i>

08:45.692 --> 08:49.447
<i>Where the sidewalk ends
And the road begins</i>

08:50.280 --> 08:55.081
<i>We said goodbye on
a cold dark night</i>

09:05.295 --> 09:08.925
<i>Where the side walk ends
And the road begins</i>

09:09.799 --> 09:11.551
<i>We said goodbye</i>

09:12.260 --> 09:14.683
<i>On a cold dark night</i>

09:14.846 --> 09:18.692
<i>I'm not afraid to go
You bet I'm not</i>

09:19.601 --> 09:23.401
<i>Where the side walk
ends, you left a lot</i>

09:24.272 --> 09:28.573
<i>Where the sidewalk
ends you left a lot</i>

09:28.902 --> 09:34.124
<i>Where the sidewalk
ends you left a lot</i>

09:47.337 --> 09:48.714
God bless!

09:54.803 --> 09:56.555
We're bringing him in. Get ready.

09:56.721 --> 09:58.189
You killed them tonight, boss.

09:58.348 --> 10:01.773
Yeah, great show. Better
than ever. Incredible sound.

10:15.323 --> 10:18.167
Come on, that's all. That's all.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.005
What?

10:30.171 --> 10:32.515
Heh. What?

10:36.803 --> 10:38.020
You all right?

10:38.346 --> 10:40.314
It's all that damn smoke.

10:43.685 --> 10:45.687
It was a great show
tonight, don't you think?

10:45.854 --> 10:48.858
Bobby Louis went on and
on about that interview.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.818
Lula, Bobby Louis is a jerk.

10:52.068 --> 10:53.615
We need him.

10:53.778 --> 10:56.827
He's gonna give you good
publicity for your new record.

10:56.990 --> 11:00.995
Hey, Earl and I wrote a really nice
song. We're thinking maybe...

11:01.202 --> 11:04.046
we'd like to simplify the
arrangements on this new album.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.421
That reminds me...

11:08.543 --> 11:11.763
I got a new song I want you
to try out next few nights.

11:12.297 --> 11:14.299
I think it's gonna
be your new single.

11:14.465 --> 11:16.388
Come on, give a listen.

11:16.926 --> 11:19.554
I just said I had some new
ideas for this album.

11:20.096 --> 11:22.690
When he first approached
me, I said no...

11:22.891 --> 11:25.189
but this song's really something.

11:25.393 --> 11:26.645
- Who?
- Huh?

11:26.853 --> 11:29.231
- Who?
- Oh, um...

11:30.732 --> 11:32.075
Buddy Jackson.

11:32.650 --> 11:34.072
Buddy Jackson?

11:34.444 --> 11:36.196
With the road crew?

11:37.155 --> 11:39.874
Yes. With the road crew.

11:40.033 --> 11:44.584
Hey. I don't remember you being much
more than road crew when I found you.

11:44.746 --> 11:48.421
Couldn't draw more than 20 people.
I had good taste then, didn't I?

12:24.327 --> 12:26.955
<i>Like a pony express in
the wild, wild west</i>

12:27.121 --> 12:29.294
<i>I'll ride hard all night long</i>

12:29.832 --> 12:32.802
<i>And I can saddle up fast,
Get you there first class</i>

12:32.961 --> 12:35.180
<i>Long before the dawn</i>

12:35.546 --> 12:40.803
<i>You know your mail's gonna get to you
Come snow, rain, sleet or hail</i>

12:40.969 --> 12:42.721
<i>'Cause I'm a top
flight, hold-you-tight</i>

12:42.887 --> 12:46.357
<i>Get-you-there-by-daylight,
Do-you-right overnight male.</i>

12:46.766 --> 12:47.858
Ho! Hold it, now!

12:51.354 --> 12:53.356
- Hold it!
- Come back here!

12:59.487 --> 13:00.659
Buddy?

13:01.364 --> 13:03.162
That's great. That's great.

13:04.158 --> 13:08.538
- Thank you, man.
- That's not exactly what I had in mind.

13:08.705 --> 13:11.003
- What's not?
- It just needs...

13:12.166 --> 13:15.716
- It just needs more... More energy.
- More energy?

13:15.878 --> 13:17.471
<i>Top flight, hold me tight</i>

13:18.339 --> 13:22.435
- See what I mean?
- More energy. More energy.

13:23.678 --> 13:26.272
All right. What else?

13:30.476 --> 13:33.525
Then we bring in the strings.
Bring in the horns.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.907
It's gonna sound great.

13:36.607 --> 13:39.656
We'll bring the strings
and the horns in.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.788
- Accordion.
- Heh, heh, heh.

13:43.364 --> 13:45.037
How about the accordion?

13:48.453 --> 13:49.830
No accordion?

13:50.538 --> 13:51.630
No accordion.

13:54.709 --> 13:55.926
What else?

13:57.128 --> 13:59.096
- That's it. It'll sound great.
- That's it?

13:59.255 --> 14:01.724
- Thank you, man. We'll work on it.
- Go ahead, now.

14:02.050 --> 14:03.097
Thank you so much.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.853
- It'll sound great.
- Thanks a bunch.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.018
Get him out of here.

14:09.932 --> 14:12.936
Come over here. Come on.
Come on. I want to talk to you.

14:20.735 --> 14:22.954
Whoo. What a nerd.

14:38.961 --> 14:42.966
<i>Let me be your mailman
And I'll always come through</i>

14:43.424 --> 14:46.098
<i>There's no denyin',
Come rain or shine</i>

14:46.260 --> 14:48.558
<i>I'll deliver my love to you</i>

14:49.263 --> 14:54.190
<i>I do things by the letter,
You can put your stamp on me</i>

14:54.602 --> 14:56.946
Don't you ever, ever do that again.

14:57.105 --> 14:58.402
Do what again?

15:00.274 --> 15:02.197
You really don't know, do you?

15:03.611 --> 15:06.740
He is the big star.
You are the road crew.

15:06.948 --> 15:10.418
- I won't be if that song...
- You will if you don't listen to me.

15:10.660 --> 15:13.630
Now you are a very talented guy.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.920
And you're a cute one too.

15:16.541 --> 15:20.262
There are a lot of talented cute
guys dying to be where he's at.

15:21.295 --> 15:22.638
I got him there.

15:22.964 --> 15:24.682
I can get you there too.

15:25.216 --> 15:27.014
You just gotta listen to me.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.145
Okay?

15:32.974 --> 15:37.901
<i>I know your heart is fragile,
So I'll handle it with care</i>

15:38.896 --> 15:41.570
<i>There ain't no doubt,
I know love's route</i>

15:41.774 --> 15:43.697
<i>So, baby, let me take you there</i>

15:44.235 --> 15:49.332
<i>I'll bring you cards and flowers,
But I know just what you need</i>

15:49.949 --> 15:54.876
<i>Just give me 24-hours
satisfaction guarantee</i>

15:57.165 --> 16:02.171
<i>Like a pony express in the wild, wild west
I'll ride hard all night long</i>

16:02.628 --> 16:05.598
<i>And I can saddle up fast,
Get you there first class</i>

16:05.756 --> 16:07.804
<i>Long before the dawn</i>

16:08.301 --> 16:10.850
<i>You know your mail's
gonna get to you</i>

16:11.012 --> 16:13.140
<i>Come snow, rain, sleet or hail</i>

16:13.890 --> 16:15.517
<i>'Cause I'm a top
flight, hold-you-tight</i>

16:15.683 --> 16:19.278
<i>Get-you-there-by-daylight,
Do-you-right overnight male</i>

16:31.073 --> 16:36.125
<i>You know your mail's gonna get to you

16:36.454 --> 16:39.549
<i>'Cause I'm a top flight, hold-you-tight,
Get-you-there-by-daylight</i>

16:39.707 --> 16:42.085
<i>Do-you-right overnight male</i>

16:43.544 --> 16:46.639
<i>Yeah, I'm a top flight, hold-you-tight,
Get-you-there-by-daylight</i>

16:46.797 --> 16:49.721
<i>Do-you-right overnight male</i>

17:23.084 --> 17:27.180
<i>Where the sidewalk ends
And the road begins</i>

17:27.755 --> 17:32.386
<i>We said goodbye
On cold dark night</i>

17:32.760 --> 17:37.311
<i>I'm not afraid to go
You bet I'm not</i>

17:38.099 --> 17:41.148
- Did you hear that? Heh.
- Oh! Oh!

17:41.310 --> 17:43.904
Whoo-hoo! They went
crazy over my song.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.787
You're not supposed to be in here.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.918
So, what if I'm in here?

17:58.244 --> 18:01.748
<i>You started learning
What you don't need to know</i>

18:01.914 --> 18:05.964
<i>Where the sidewalk ends
And the road begins</i>

18:06.752 --> 18:11.474
<i>I'll wait for you in
the cold dark night</i>

18:11.632 --> 18:15.728
<i>You might come back, you had to go</i>

18:16.470 --> 18:20.441
<i>Where the sidewalk ends,
I'll never know</i>

18:22.602 --> 18:26.527
<i>Hide from the future,
run from the past</i>

18:27.315 --> 18:31.365
<i>I guess I'll stay here
as long as I can last</i>

18:32.153 --> 18:36.158
<i>Whistles still blow
but the train is gone</i>

18:37.158 --> 18:40.662
<i>Ain't no wheels gonna take me
From my home</i>

18:41.037 --> 18:44.587
<i>Where the sidewalk ends
And the road begins</i>

18:45.541 --> 18:49.796
<i>We said goodbye on
a cold dark night</i>

18:50.588 --> 18:54.468
<i>I'm not afraid to go
You bet I'm not</i>

18:55.343 --> 18:59.223
<i>Where the side walk
ends, you left a lot</i>

19:24.455 --> 19:26.423
<i>I'm not afraid to go</i>

19:26.999 --> 19:28.501
<i>You bet I'm not</i>

19:29.460 --> 19:31.337
<i>Where the sidewalk ends</i>

19:43.808 --> 19:47.904
<i>I'm not afraid to
go you bet I'm not</i>

19:48.813 --> 19:52.488
<i>Where the side walk
ends, you left a lot</i>

19:53.609 --> 19:57.409
<i>Where the side walk
ends, you left a lot</i>

19:58.072 --> 20:03.203
<i>Where the side walk
ends, you left a lot</i>

20:21.429 --> 20:23.056
See you next trip.

20:24.265 --> 20:25.357
What?

20:39.697 --> 20:42.746
Wait a minute. I don't want
him to find you here. Go on.

20:50.499 --> 20:51.591
Out.

20:52.293 --> 20:53.670
So, what if he finds me here?

20:54.044 --> 20:56.263
You were really killing
them tonight, boss.

20:56.422 --> 21:00.143
Yeah, great show. Better than
ever. Incredible sound.

21:00.301 --> 21:01.723
Hear them screaming?

21:01.886 --> 21:03.809
Ha-ha-ha! They went crazy!

21:03.971 --> 21:05.518
Over here, Dusty!

21:05.681 --> 21:06.978
That's exciting.

21:34.668 --> 21:36.966
What was Buddy Jackson
doing in here?

21:38.798 --> 21:41.847
- "See you next trip"?
- Yes. See you next trip.

21:42.009 --> 21:44.478
Since when do you start
changing my show?

21:46.764 --> 21:50.860
Your show? I don't remember seeing you
out there making those people scream.

21:52.019 --> 21:53.896
What is your problem, Dusty?

21:54.939 --> 21:56.156
I'm tired.

21:56.732 --> 22:00.828
I'm tired of the smoke and
the lights. It ain't me.

22:01.529 --> 22:04.703
It's not a cowboy bar with drunks
sitting around a little stage.

22:04.865 --> 22:09.086
This is 20,000 people. They came to see
a show, and they want to see a big one.

22:09.245 --> 22:12.249
Hell, they can't see me for
all the smoke and the lights.

22:12.414 --> 22:14.917
They can't hear me, the
music's so damn loud.

22:15.084 --> 22:20.090
I stopped singing out there for three bars.
Three bars, and nobody even noticed.

22:20.923 --> 22:23.893
- What are you trying to say?
- I'm saying I don't like it.

22:24.051 --> 22:27.430
I don't like the sets.
I don't like the lights.

22:27.596 --> 22:30.566
And I don't like you sneaking
your boyfriend in my bus.

22:30.724 --> 22:33.853
And I don't like you cramming
his songs down my throat.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.693
He is your boyfriend, isn't he?

22:38.065 --> 22:40.909
My personal life is none
of your business anymore.

22:41.610 --> 22:44.363
Well, maybe your business
doesn't belong in my show.

22:49.243 --> 22:50.665
If it wasn't for me...

22:50.828 --> 22:54.048
you would probably still be singing
in some run-down rat hole...

22:54.206 --> 22:56.834
for a bunch of fat
cowgirls from Iowa.

22:57.126 --> 22:59.800
Yeah, and if it wasn't for me, you'd
probably be a waitress there.

22:59.962 --> 23:02.761
- Uh-oh.
- You listen to me.

23:02.923 --> 23:07.349
Guys like you who can sing are a dime a
dozen. I can find another in a hot minute.

23:07.553 --> 23:09.305
Yeah, well, go find one, then.

23:09.763 --> 23:10.935
Fine!

23:12.766 --> 23:14.814
Relax. Just relax.

23:25.613 --> 23:29.334
- Sounds like you need a beer, brother.
- You heard? No, thanks.

23:29.491 --> 23:30.743
Oh, yeah.

23:34.204 --> 23:38.334
Man, why does it always
have to be like this?

23:39.543 --> 23:42.342
I mean, everything's
gotten so complicated.

23:44.423 --> 23:47.097
Sometimes I just want
to dump the whole deal.

23:48.802 --> 23:51.100
Including this
stupid-looking outfit.

23:53.682 --> 23:56.606
Oh, hell, Wyatt, it's
better than a real job.

23:57.686 --> 24:00.155
Besides, you're helping
me pay my alimony.

24:06.445 --> 24:07.537
Man...

24:08.155 --> 24:11.409
remember when we was kids,
we snuck out to that carnival?

24:11.575 --> 24:14.545
That one we snuck into because
we didn't have the money.

24:14.703 --> 24:16.501
Yeah, with that fat, old...

24:16.914 --> 24:20.214
bald-headed guy with
the sweaty armpits.

24:20.417 --> 24:22.010
Had that dancing chicken.

24:24.797 --> 24:27.346
Remember when he put
that chicken on stage?

24:28.342 --> 24:32.563
We snuck around back. With one hand,
he was putting the needle on the record.

24:32.721 --> 24:36.271
And with his other, he was turning
on the stove underneath the stage.

24:36.433 --> 24:38.936
That chicken, his feet was burning.

24:39.103 --> 24:42.073
It started hopping all over
the place, just dancing.

24:44.608 --> 24:46.531
Ohh.

24:47.194 --> 24:48.696
The dancing chicken.

24:50.114 --> 24:51.366
Hm.

24:53.909 --> 24:56.537
Yeah, sometimes I feel
like a dancing chicken.

25:05.004 --> 25:07.006
You know what I always wondered?

25:07.339 --> 25:09.637
Why didn't that chicken
just hop off the stage?

25:16.890 --> 25:19.234
- Sure you don't want one?
- No.

25:19.560 --> 25:21.562
What are you gonna do tonight?

25:22.730 --> 25:24.232
Sit right here...

25:24.398 --> 25:26.651
smell the horse manure...

25:26.817 --> 25:30.867
finish down this six-pack, and
go find me a fine-looking woman.

25:31.405 --> 25:33.248
Wife for a night.

25:34.366 --> 25:35.413
How about you?

25:35.576 --> 25:38.204
I think I'm just gonna
take me a little walk.

25:43.250 --> 25:44.422
Take care.

25:45.419 --> 25:47.421
Hey, man, I'll see you around.

27:19.555 --> 27:20.977
Get his bags.

27:37.364 --> 27:38.866
What are you doing?

27:39.324 --> 27:41.827
Just wanted to feel like
I was out in California.

27:43.745 --> 27:45.167
Where's Dusty?

27:46.415 --> 27:47.883
He took a walk.

27:49.710 --> 27:50.882
Where?

27:51.712 --> 27:54.010
- I don't know.
- Knock it off, Earl.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.846
I'm worried.

27:57.176 --> 27:59.975
- Did you see him last night?
- Yeah.

28:00.554 --> 28:02.352
What was he doing?

28:03.807 --> 28:05.229
Was he drunk?

28:06.101 --> 28:08.399
No. I was.

28:11.064 --> 28:13.533
Did he say where he was going?

28:14.943 --> 28:16.069
Yeah.

28:16.987 --> 28:18.455
Earl!

28:18.947 --> 28:21.200
Where did he say he was going?

28:23.035 --> 28:24.582
To take a walk.

30:42.382 --> 30:44.350
You boys are making me work.

30:44.885 --> 30:46.683
You know I don't like that.

30:47.554 --> 30:49.773
Oh, yeah. Right.

31:24.424 --> 31:26.927
- Hi, you.
- Hello.

31:34.184 --> 31:36.186
Are you new around here?

31:38.021 --> 31:39.523
Yeah.

31:39.898 --> 31:41.024
Brand-new.

31:41.191 --> 31:43.660
Oh. Welcome.

31:43.819 --> 31:45.162
Well, thanks.

32:44.004 --> 32:45.347
Hello, Grandma.

32:52.512 --> 32:54.185
Did I miss the parade?

32:55.807 --> 32:57.059
What parade?

32:57.225 --> 33:00.024
You know, the one that usually
arrives before you do.

33:00.437 --> 33:02.155
That nice tour manager...

33:02.689 --> 33:05.818
and all those bodyguards
and the reporters.

33:06.526 --> 33:08.244
No. It's just me this time.

33:09.905 --> 33:13.500
I hardly recognized you without
all that hair. Ha, ha.

33:21.791 --> 33:23.043
Oh, yeah?

33:23.543 --> 33:25.170
- Did you quit?
- No.

33:26.213 --> 33:28.090
It's just a short pause.

33:31.134 --> 33:33.853
- So how are you?
- Oh, hell, I'm fine.

33:34.721 --> 33:38.521
I'd like to quit. It's just
getting bigger and bigger.

33:39.559 --> 33:43.063
- Starting to look like a circus.
- I saw you over in Dallas.

33:43.563 --> 33:47.033
- That was quite an extravaganza.
- Why didn't you call me?

33:47.192 --> 33:50.366
I'd have got you tickets and you
could've been backstage with me.

33:50.529 --> 33:51.906
You were working.

33:52.113 --> 33:54.707
You don't disturb men
when they're working.

33:54.866 --> 33:57.244
- Did you like it?
- Of course I did.

33:57.702 --> 33:59.420
It was you singing.

34:00.705 --> 34:02.582
I love to hear you sing.

34:03.208 --> 34:07.588
- But...
- It was loud, and I couldn't hear the words.

34:07.921 --> 34:10.389
Without the words, there's no song.

34:11.132 --> 34:12.304
And?

34:12.926 --> 34:15.600
I could've done without
the smoke and the lights.

34:15.762 --> 34:18.356
- Yeah, me too.
- But the kids liked it.

34:27.482 --> 34:30.031
- You kept my old guitar.
- Yeah.

34:40.745 --> 34:42.918
I learned to play on this old Dove.

34:44.958 --> 34:46.130
Yeah.

34:46.710 --> 34:50.635
I kept it around in case you might
want to play me a song sometime.

34:52.382 --> 34:54.304
No smoke. No lights.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.428
No amplifiers.

34:57.220 --> 34:59.848
No big-stage production.
Just me and my guitar.

35:00.015 --> 35:02.939
- Think anybody would buy that?
- I would.

35:17.032 --> 35:19.330
Bye, Grandma. I'll see you soon.

37:11.896 --> 37:12.943
Howdy.

37:13.565 --> 37:14.862
Want a beer?

37:15.400 --> 37:17.118
Yeah, I'll take a beer.

37:29.831 --> 37:32.004
Is there a rent-car place
anywhere nearby?

37:33.209 --> 37:34.882
Where you trying to get?

37:35.211 --> 37:36.929
Louisiana. Shreveport.

37:39.090 --> 37:40.262
Here.

37:44.846 --> 37:48.646
I used to play in here years ago,
back when I was in high school.

37:49.309 --> 37:51.311
Yeah, I know who you are.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.527
- You do?
- Yes, sir.

37:55.607 --> 37:57.609
I tell you, the place
hasn't changed much.

37:58.735 --> 38:01.204
No. No.

38:02.030 --> 38:05.500
If you played here, you earned
this. It's on the house.

38:06.409 --> 38:07.877
Thank you.

38:08.036 --> 38:10.880
There is a General rent-a-car
place just down the road.

38:11.039 --> 38:13.667
Okay. Appreciate it.

39:25.697 --> 39:30.954
<i>My friends, Shreveport, Louisiana
welcomes Dusty in concert.</i>

39:52.515 --> 39:54.313
Dave, come in. Anything?

39:55.143 --> 39:57.942
<i>Nothing, Lula. We have all
the entrances watched.</i>

40:04.652 --> 40:06.950
I'm too old for this.

40:11.951 --> 40:14.045
Hey, we can't hear it, man.

40:21.753 --> 40:24.677
Will somebody please
tell me where he is?

40:26.049 --> 40:27.596
Put that thing away.

40:30.386 --> 40:32.138
One of you must know.

40:33.765 --> 40:37.144
- Earl?
- How many times you gonna ask me?

40:38.478 --> 40:41.197
All right. All right, look.

40:43.191 --> 40:45.489
Dusty and I had a
fight the other day.

40:46.402 --> 40:48.780
And I said some things
I shouldn't have.

40:49.822 --> 40:51.244
And I'm sorry.

40:52.617 --> 40:57.043
But I can't apologize to him until
one of you tells me where he is!

40:57.538 --> 41:01.338
- Are you cancelling the show?
- No, I'm not cancelling the show.

41:01.751 --> 41:03.845
There are 25,000 fans out there.

41:04.462 --> 41:07.181
Some of them drove hundreds
of miles to get here.

41:07.340 --> 41:09.468
And they're gonna get their show.

41:14.681 --> 41:16.308
He'll be here.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.352
Thanks, gentlemen.

41:20.019 --> 41:22.522
Y'all been a real big help.

41:22.855 --> 41:25.529
You're supposed to be out on
that stage in five minutes.

41:25.692 --> 41:29.071
I suggest if you wanna keep your
jobs, you better get out there.

41:35.159 --> 41:37.958
<i>Dusty! Dusty! Dusty!</i>

41:46.212 --> 41:47.429
Dave.

41:50.842 --> 41:52.435
Let's do it.

41:53.052 --> 41:54.144
Dusty?

41:54.303 --> 41:56.806
<i>Dusty! Dusty! Dusty!</i>

42:03.271 --> 42:05.023
Bring the lights
down really slowly.

42:08.067 --> 42:10.445
More smoke. Now. Right now.

42:16.909 --> 42:18.286
I think we got it.

42:19.120 --> 42:21.464
Okay. Good.

42:22.206 --> 42:25.460
<i>When you hear twin fiddles
And a steel guitar</i>

42:28.588 --> 42:32.309
<i>You're listening to the sound
Of the American heart</i>

42:33.926 --> 42:36.429
<i>And Opry music on a Saturday night</i>

42:36.596 --> 42:40.772
<i>Brings a smile to your face
And a tear to your eye</i>

42:52.528 --> 42:53.905
Whoo!

45:00.990 --> 45:03.584
- Harley, honey. How about a little dance?
- Not now, Al.

45:03.743 --> 45:06.246
Oh, come on. Why are you
always avoiding me?

45:52.458 --> 45:54.210
- Where are you going?
- I'm going home.

45:54.377 --> 45:56.630
- Oh, come on.
- Al, leave me alone!

46:04.387 --> 46:06.731
- Hold on. Where you going?
- I'm going home.

46:06.889 --> 46:09.642
- Come on back in.
- I don't want to. I'm going home.

46:10.101 --> 46:11.978
I don't like you. Leave me alone!

46:12.144 --> 46:14.317
- Leave her alone.
- What do you want?

46:14.480 --> 46:17.074
- No, Al! Don't!
- You better back off, cowboy!

46:17.233 --> 46:20.328
- Come on, there's no need to do this!
- I said, back off!

46:20.486 --> 46:21.988
Leave him alone.

46:22.154 --> 46:23.326
Al, come on.

46:23.489 --> 46:25.992
- You're bothering the lady.
- No, don't!

46:26.409 --> 46:29.583
Al, no! Al, that's enough!

46:30.496 --> 46:32.874
God! Why does he
always do this to me?

46:34.667 --> 46:35.884
Al, stop it!

46:36.043 --> 46:38.387
- Hell, he started it.
- Leave him alone. Stop it.

46:38.546 --> 46:41.516
- You should've stayed inside.
- Leave him alone. That's enough!

46:42.174 --> 46:46.350
- Stop it, now. Just stop it!
- Come on back in. Come on back in, now.

46:46.512 --> 46:47.684
Ahh! Ahh!

46:47.847 --> 46:50.521
Harley, my hand! My hand!

46:51.100 --> 46:53.194
- Watch your hands!
- Open the door! Ohh!

46:53.352 --> 46:55.525
Oh, my nose!

46:56.939 --> 47:00.318
- Sorry. I'm sorry about your nose.
- Leave me alone, Harley!

47:00.568 --> 47:03.663
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It was a mistake.
- Leave me alone.

47:05.072 --> 47:07.370
Why is this happening to me?

47:20.129 --> 47:24.054
<i>I'm not afraid to go
You bet I'm not</i>

47:24.884 --> 47:28.889
<i>Where the side walk
ends, you left a lot</i>

47:29.722 --> 47:33.818
<i>Where the sidewalk ends
And the road begins</i>

47:34.560 --> 47:39.236
<i>We said goodbye on
a cold dark night</i>

47:39.690 --> 47:43.536
<i>I'm not afraid to go
You bet I'm not</i>

47:44.236 --> 47:48.241
<i>Where the side walk
ends, you left a lot</i>

47:49.116 --> 47:53.622
<i>Where the side walk
ends, you left a lot</i>

47:53.996 --> 47:59.002
<i>Where the side walk
ends, you left a lot</i>

48:02.088 --> 48:05.683
Kill spot. Kill it.
Listen to me! Kill spot.

48:28.280 --> 48:30.624
- Bobby.
- Nice show, Lula.

48:30.908 --> 48:31.955
Thanks.

48:32.118 --> 48:35.713
When's Dusty gonna be ready to give
me the rest of that interview?

48:35.871 --> 48:38.670
I've got a plane to catch
in about two hours.

48:38.833 --> 48:41.211
I'm not gonna let Dusty
do the interview tonight.

48:41.377 --> 48:44.381
He's been fighting a sore throat
and I just wanna keep him quiet.

48:44.547 --> 48:47.676
Come on. I just got a couple
of questions. It's no big deal.

48:48.300 --> 48:50.644
Hey, Lula, it's a good show, huh?

48:51.303 --> 48:54.477
Can't do it. My first
responsibility is to Dusty.

48:55.558 --> 48:56.684
I gotta go.

48:57.184 --> 48:59.403
- Wait a minute.
- Sam.

48:59.687 --> 49:02.281
I want you to take Mr.
Louis to the airport.

49:02.440 --> 49:04.863
See he's taken care of.
Catch you in Vegas, okay?

49:05.025 --> 49:07.995
You are really starting
to wear me slick.

49:08.446 --> 49:12.542
We're not playing games. Get in the
bus before somebody sees your face.

49:12.950 --> 49:14.668
What the hell you doing?

49:14.827 --> 49:17.876
- I'm going in this bus.
- No, that's Dusty's bus.

49:18.831 --> 49:20.549
Well, tonight, I'm Dusty.

49:21.250 --> 49:24.003
You don't want my fans to
get suspicious, do you?

49:25.129 --> 49:26.847
You don't belong in there.

49:30.342 --> 49:33.186
Lula, you better get over here.
We have a problem.

49:39.602 --> 49:40.649
Peckerhead.

49:53.908 --> 49:56.957
Well, what do you think?

49:58.204 --> 50:01.708
Buddy, we were real lucky. If there
was one glitch with the tape...

50:01.874 --> 50:04.878
- if Bobby Louis had come much closer...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

50:07.338 --> 50:09.591
Hell, aren't you
even gonna thank me?

50:10.633 --> 50:11.885
Yes.

50:12.176 --> 50:14.224
Yes, of course, I am.

50:14.386 --> 50:17.185
- Thank you.
- Good. Then we can...

50:17.348 --> 50:18.895
We can go celebrate.

50:23.437 --> 50:24.484
Lula.

50:25.439 --> 50:28.613
The guys in the band would
like to have a word with you.

50:38.160 --> 50:40.913
Get him out of these clothes
before someone sees him.

50:41.080 --> 50:42.878
You bet.

50:43.749 --> 50:45.296
Ah, hell.

50:46.752 --> 50:48.254
You guys were great tonight.

50:48.420 --> 50:50.923
What the hell was Buddy
Jackson doing out there?

50:51.090 --> 50:54.765
Why didn't you just cancel the
show, rain check it or something?

50:54.927 --> 50:56.975
We can't play with a guy
who's lip-synching.

50:57.137 --> 51:00.767
If we speed up or slow down, he can't
follow us or the audience will know.

51:00.933 --> 51:02.276
Where is Dusty, anyway?

51:02.434 --> 51:05.108
Buddy Jackson? Have you
lost your mind, Lula?

51:05.271 --> 51:07.319
If I hadn't done what I did...

51:07.773 --> 51:10.276
all of those people would
have gone home mad.

51:10.442 --> 51:11.739
And we...

51:11.902 --> 51:13.825
would all be out of a job.

51:14.446 --> 51:17.165
Now, I am sure that
your ex-wives...

51:17.324 --> 51:19.998
and Henry's five kids
and Keith's mother...

51:20.160 --> 51:22.788
don't care if it was
Buddy, Dusty...

51:23.372 --> 51:28.003
or King Kong up there on that stage,
so long as you get your paychecks.

51:28.168 --> 51:32.298
You know I have always
taken care of you guys.

51:33.799 --> 51:34.891
Now...

51:35.134 --> 51:38.513
we've got a little time off before
we get to the big show in Vegas.

51:39.888 --> 51:43.483
Everything will be
straightened out.

51:46.103 --> 51:47.696
Dusty will be back.

51:49.148 --> 51:53.824
I'm gonna tell you something. I need you
to promise me you will not say one word...

51:53.986 --> 51:56.409
to anybody about what
happened tonight.

51:57.156 --> 51:58.874
This is for Dusty's sake.

52:00.409 --> 52:02.878
- And your own.
- For Dusty's sake?

52:03.370 --> 52:05.464
I'm sick to death of your crap.

52:07.416 --> 52:10.044
You had him hung up and
twisting in the wind.

52:11.503 --> 52:14.848
He had nothing to do with this.
Tonight was all you, Lula.

52:15.007 --> 52:17.009
He had nothing to do with this?

52:17.676 --> 52:18.893
He walked out.

52:19.053 --> 52:23.229
And he left you and me and everyone
in this room sitting on their thumbs.

52:23.432 --> 52:27.187
- He had everything to do with it.
- You should have cancelled tonight.

52:28.187 --> 52:31.236
I ain't gonna be a damn dancing
chicken in your freak show.

52:32.024 --> 52:33.901
Get yourself another drummer.

52:34.360 --> 52:35.612
Earl.

52:37.780 --> 52:38.872
Hey, Earl.

52:40.324 --> 52:41.746
Let's do it.

52:42.785 --> 52:44.708
Why the hell not?

53:41.677 --> 53:44.601
- What day is this?
- Friday.

53:45.639 --> 53:47.812
Oh, my. The show.

53:52.229 --> 53:55.483
- You know horses?
- I know a few.

54:07.453 --> 54:08.955
I'm sorry. I was...

54:09.997 --> 54:11.840
a little drunk last night.

54:11.999 --> 54:13.296
Yes, you were.

54:15.794 --> 54:17.011
My name's Wyatt.

54:18.255 --> 54:19.677
Wyatt.

54:22.551 --> 54:23.928
Well, Wyatt...

54:24.470 --> 54:25.847
you can't drink.

54:27.848 --> 54:29.850
And you can't fight.

54:31.560 --> 54:33.187
Can you eat?

54:35.689 --> 54:37.032
Yeah, I think so.

54:38.275 --> 54:42.121
Okay. Might as well
have some breakfast.

54:42.613 --> 54:44.240
Before you go.

54:50.746 --> 54:52.043
Well, come on.

54:57.002 --> 54:58.049
Excuse me.

55:02.424 --> 55:04.051
You can sit over there.

55:30.536 --> 55:32.630
Sure do appreciate
your hospitality.

55:40.212 --> 55:41.259
The hat.

56:01.358 --> 56:02.826
Sure is good.

56:14.371 --> 56:19.628
Harley. You were nearly three seconds
long on that pattern this morning.

56:22.546 --> 56:24.298
I got in late.

56:25.757 --> 56:29.102
Maybe you should just get in a
little bit earlier, you know.

56:31.930 --> 56:34.228
We all need to win this time.

57:21.813 --> 57:23.893
- Hey, Harley.
- What are you doing here?

57:23.982 --> 57:26.952
- What are you doing here?
- I felt bad... Don't be like that.

57:27.110 --> 57:31.081
Why do you have to start this all the
time? Go back in the truck, go home!

57:31.239 --> 57:33.992
Who was that fella last night?
I've never seen him around.

57:34.159 --> 57:35.411
None of your business.

57:35.577 --> 57:38.080
It's not like you know him or
something. What's the deal?

57:38.246 --> 57:41.170
What right do you have to tell
me what I can and can't do! Go!

57:41.333 --> 57:45.008
- You made a mess out of me last night.
- Excuse me.

57:45.671 --> 57:48.470
Why don't you just shoot me
and put me out of my misery.

57:48.632 --> 57:52.262
- I'm sorry about that.
- It's okay, it's not about my nose.

57:52.427 --> 57:55.601
I don't want you coming here and
telling me what I can and can't do.

57:55.764 --> 57:59.860
- I am not telling you what to do.
- You do it all the time! I'm tired of it!

58:00.018 --> 58:02.862
- How long have we known one another?
- Don't you start that.

58:03.021 --> 58:04.694
I'm not starting nothing.

58:04.856 --> 58:07.109
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

58:07.275 --> 58:08.948
Just go back in the
house. Go ahead.

58:10.862 --> 58:14.162
Yeah. Don't you remember that
beating you got last night?

58:14.324 --> 58:18.204
Me? You look like the one
who took the beating.

58:18.829 --> 58:21.082
Not by you. I whupped your ass.

58:21.373 --> 58:23.296
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, really.

58:23.458 --> 58:25.881
What's the matter? Were
you too drunk to notice?

58:26.044 --> 58:28.638
Stop it! Just stop it! Stop it!

58:30.257 --> 58:34.262
Now, we were all drunk last night,
and I'm sure we're all sorry.

58:34.720 --> 58:36.722
Come on, Al, get in
your truck and go home.

58:36.888 --> 58:40.267
Me? Why should I?
This drunk is staying.

58:40.434 --> 58:43.938
- Look, Harley, honey...
- The lady said to leave.

58:44.646 --> 58:48.276
Boy, you're just begging for
another ass-whupping, aren't you?

58:48.525 --> 58:49.777
Absolutely.

58:54.281 --> 58:58.787
What're you doing? What're you doing?
Just go back in the house. Go!

58:58.952 --> 59:01.296
- Oh, my nose!
- Go back in the house.

59:01.455 --> 59:02.832
My nose!

59:02.998 --> 59:04.420
Just go!

59:05.000 --> 59:08.095
Ahh! My hand! Oh, God!

59:10.672 --> 59:13.425
- Come on.
- It's busted up right now.

59:15.385 --> 59:17.308
He busted my nose again.

59:20.265 --> 59:21.767
Get my hat.

59:49.961 --> 59:51.679
Sure is a beautiful ranch.

59:58.804 --> 01:00:00.602
About how many acres y'all got?

01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:25.126
Yeah, I can't blame you
for keeping quiet.

01:00:25.872 --> 01:00:28.967
Kind of hard to get a word in
edgewise with those three.

01:00:32.170 --> 01:00:33.422
Yes, sir.

01:00:33.588 --> 01:00:36.592
People talk too darn
much for my taste.

01:00:37.926 --> 01:00:40.975
Yapping about this and that
when they ought to be...

01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:42.936
eating, working or sleeping.

01:00:43.098 --> 01:00:46.898
What's anybody say that everybody
doesn't already know anyway?

01:00:47.352 --> 01:00:51.073
- Can you tell me that?
- No, sir, I can't.

01:00:51.231 --> 01:00:54.861
That's too bad. Take,
for example, this morning.

01:00:55.861 --> 01:00:59.331
Now, we all know that Harley
was slow on her ride.

01:01:00.323 --> 01:01:04.044
We know she was out late last night.
That's no front-page news.

01:01:04.369 --> 01:01:06.087
So why talk about it?

01:01:11.918 --> 01:01:14.387
I guess I see what you're saying.

01:01:15.630 --> 01:01:18.850
You guess? Never guess.

01:01:19.342 --> 01:01:22.391
You got to know. I mean you got
to know what you're doing.

01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:26.521
If you guess, you're leaving
yourself wide open to suggestion.

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:29.778
And that, to my mind, is what's
wrong with this whole country.

01:01:29.936 --> 01:01:32.030
I mean it's going straight to hell.

01:01:33.315 --> 01:01:35.693
Everybody's open to suggestion.

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:43.458
Well, you coming or are
you just gonna sit there?

01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:02.765
- How long've you known Harley?
- Not very long.

01:02:04.638 --> 01:02:06.311
- Thousand.
- Pardon?

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:09.518
- Uh, thousand acres.
- Oh.

01:02:10.685 --> 01:02:12.403
Used to be more.

01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:15.323
- What happened?
- Well...

01:02:15.982 --> 01:02:20.158
Getting to be a business. I'm a rancher.
I don't want to be a businessman.

01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:23.324
And taxes are getting
harder to pay.

01:02:23.698 --> 01:02:25.496
People want to buy us out.

01:02:25.784 --> 01:02:29.414
Seems like we wind up
selling it off, bit by bit.

01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:34.752
I'm kind of glad I won't be around
long enough to see it all go.

01:02:34.918 --> 01:02:35.965
And Harley?

01:02:36.211 --> 01:02:41.468
Well, Harley thinks she's going to
save it by winning at the rodeo.

01:02:49.391 --> 01:02:51.393
Would you excuse us
for a minute, please?

01:03:16.543 --> 01:03:18.045
You rope pretty good.

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:21.515
I've always wanted to
learn how to do that.

01:03:21.673 --> 01:03:25.223
- Good luck.
- Any chance you'd give me some lessons?

01:03:25.385 --> 01:03:31.233
Ha, ha, ha. J.W. Did you hear that? This
guy wants us to give him roping lessons.

01:03:32.183 --> 01:03:34.151
I'll pay.

01:03:35.186 --> 01:03:36.483
In advance.

01:03:44.946 --> 01:03:46.243
In advance?

01:03:47.198 --> 01:03:48.245
Yep.

01:03:51.036 --> 01:03:54.540
Wondering if maybe you might want to
rent out that empty bunkhouse too.

01:03:54.831 --> 01:03:58.677
I could pay room and board.
Maybe stay a little while.

01:04:00.045 --> 01:04:01.513
Take some roping lessons.

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:08.307
Okay.

01:04:10.889 --> 01:04:12.562
You want to buy a rope?

01:04:13.266 --> 01:04:14.438
You mind telling me...

01:04:14.601 --> 01:04:17.400
- why you can't stand still for one minute?
- All right.

01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:21.442
I just don't believe you're telling
our problems to a perfect stranger.

01:04:21.649 --> 01:04:24.402
Our problems with this ranch
are none of his business.

01:04:24.569 --> 01:04:28.369
If he's such a perfect stranger, what
are you doing bringing him home?

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:30.454
He got knocked out
defending my honor.

01:04:30.617 --> 01:04:33.416
Was I supposed to leave him
lying there on the ground?

01:04:33.578 --> 01:04:36.957
- If you hadn't liked him, you would have.
- I do not like him.

01:04:37.123 --> 01:04:39.842
Then why is he making
you so nervous?

01:04:44.005 --> 01:04:45.552
I'll be right back.

01:05:04.526 --> 01:05:06.824
What's he doing on a horse?

01:05:07.404 --> 01:05:10.123
- Well, he bought it.
- He what?

01:05:10.281 --> 01:05:14.582
- He's gonna be staying with us for a while.
- What?

01:05:14.786 --> 01:05:18.165
For roping lessons and room
and board. He's paying.

01:05:19.457 --> 01:05:20.925
What's your problem?

01:05:21.626 --> 01:05:23.344
You like him, don't you?

01:05:25.713 --> 01:05:28.011
Why does everybody
keep saying that?

01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:34.853
"Lights and smoke swirling,
his voice particularly strong...

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:39.486
Dusty delivered the performance of his
life last night in Shreveport Auditorium."

01:05:39.644 --> 01:05:41.146
Idiots.

01:05:41.312 --> 01:05:44.316
Idiots? Hell, they love me. They
think I'm better than Dusty.

01:05:44.482 --> 01:05:45.608
Loved you?

01:05:46.317 --> 01:05:48.411
They didn't even know it was you.

01:05:48.945 --> 01:05:52.119
- Thank God they didn't.
- Maybe they should know that it's me.

01:05:55.326 --> 01:05:56.498
Buddy...

01:05:58.413 --> 01:06:00.086
you've got a lot of talent...

01:06:00.248 --> 01:06:03.798
and someday people are gonna be
spending a lot of money to see you.

01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.008
But these people paid to see Dusty.

01:06:06.171 --> 01:06:09.015
So did the people in Vegas who
bought tickets for the show.

01:06:14.721 --> 01:06:16.723
And what happens if
you don't find Dusty?

01:06:20.351 --> 01:06:21.603
I will.

01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:26.817
Uh-huh.

01:06:30.278 --> 01:06:31.871
Grandma Ivy?

01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:33.373
Who's there?

01:06:33.531 --> 01:06:35.579
- Earl Blackstock.
- Who?

01:06:35.992 --> 01:06:39.212
Earl Blackstock. Wyatt's friend.
You took us fishing.

01:06:39.370 --> 01:06:41.088
I know who you are.

01:06:41.456 --> 01:06:43.174
I just couldn't hear you.

01:06:43.666 --> 01:06:45.964
Why don't we go over
here and sit down.

01:06:46.127 --> 01:06:47.674
It's cooler over here.

01:06:48.338 --> 01:06:49.555
You're looking well, ma'am.

01:06:49.714 --> 01:06:52.012
Thank you. I'm feeling pretty good.

01:06:52.217 --> 01:06:54.561
The rain is doing great
things for your flowers.

01:06:54.719 --> 01:06:56.767
Yeah. They are pretty this year.

01:06:59.224 --> 01:07:00.601
He's not here.

01:07:04.312 --> 01:07:07.486
Tell you the truth, Grandma Ivy,
I'm pretty worried about him.

01:07:07.649 --> 01:07:09.196
He took off and...

01:07:09.776 --> 01:07:14.452
He's got all this pressure and people just
trying to get a piece of him, you know.

01:07:16.574 --> 01:07:18.042
It ain't surprising.

01:07:19.035 --> 01:07:22.380
But this one's different.
He missed a show and...

01:07:23.164 --> 01:07:26.464
- That just ain't like him.
- Well, sometimes...

01:07:26.709 --> 01:07:28.586
the tree grows too fast.

01:07:29.462 --> 01:07:31.305
And the roots don't develop.

01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:37.897
And sometimes you have to chop off the top
of that tree to let the roots catch up.

01:07:40.431 --> 01:07:42.559
- But do you know where he's at?
- No.

01:07:43.101 --> 01:07:46.150
I expect if you follow the
roots, you'll find him.

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:54.533
Grandma Ivy, in all the
years I've known you...

01:07:54.696 --> 01:07:57.449
I've never heard you answer
a question directly.

01:07:57.865 --> 01:07:59.458
There are no answers.

01:08:00.702 --> 01:08:02.170
Only the search.

01:08:03.830 --> 01:08:06.424
Yeah. Whatever that means.

01:08:10.503 --> 01:08:12.255
It was great seeing you.

01:08:12.547 --> 01:08:13.969
Yeah, you too.

01:08:14.173 --> 01:08:16.551
- Take care now.
- I will.

01:08:16.884 --> 01:08:18.136
Drive careful.

01:08:19.761 --> 01:08:24.188
Earl. Don't you leave home,
now, without seeing your mama.

01:08:24.975 --> 01:08:26.353
Yes, ma'am.

01:08:39.490 --> 01:08:43.836
No. There's no sign of Dusty.

01:09:13.107 --> 01:09:14.950
Go, go.

01:09:33.544 --> 01:09:35.136
Come on.

01:09:37.548 --> 01:09:39.220
Yes!

01:09:52.397 --> 01:09:53.990
Yes!

01:10:00.321 --> 01:10:01.447
Come in.

01:10:01.614 --> 01:10:03.412
Bobby, no.

01:10:04.909 --> 01:10:08.288
I'm not putting you off,
I swear. No, really.

01:10:08.496 --> 01:10:11.295
Dusty is working on some new
material for the Vegas show...

01:10:11.457 --> 01:10:15.758
and he don't want to be disturbed
right now. Yeah. Okay.

01:10:16.504 --> 01:10:19.474
Okay, I'll call you tomorrow.
All right, bye.

01:10:24.971 --> 01:10:27.565
- What's the problem now?
- It's Frankenstein.

01:10:27.765 --> 01:10:31.770
He's saying we better take care of him
in case Dusty doesn't show up for Vegas.

01:10:31.936 --> 01:10:34.906
Yeah. This morning he
asked me for a massage.

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:38.443
Come on, Lula, I don't have to put
up with that. I don't work for him.

01:10:38.609 --> 01:10:42.785
I know, I know, I know.
But you guys do work for me...

01:10:43.364 --> 01:10:46.243
and I want you to keep
him quiet and happy...

01:10:46.534 --> 01:10:48.457
- just a few more days.
- Yes, ma'am.

01:10:48.619 --> 01:10:51.122
And I don't want him talking
to anyone. Understand?

01:10:51.289 --> 01:10:54.509
Yes, ma'am. I'm still not
giving him a massage.

01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:57.469
Hi, there.

01:10:59.130 --> 01:11:00.473
What do you think?

01:11:01.424 --> 01:11:03.142
Looks pretty nice, huh?

01:11:05.470 --> 01:11:06.813
Well...

01:11:07.847 --> 01:11:11.977
I think it'd look a whole lot better
without that price tag right there.

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:13.857
Oh.

01:11:17.148 --> 01:11:20.948
Decided to give Dusty a new look
for Vegas. Drop the cornball stuff.

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:24.330
Buddy, you are not going to Vegas.

01:11:25.072 --> 01:11:26.949
Dusty will be back.

01:11:28.075 --> 01:11:32.251
Come on, Lula. Dusty is a joke to people
on the cutting edge. He's a farce.

01:11:32.413 --> 01:11:35.713
Since when do you know anything
about the cutting edge?

01:11:41.506 --> 01:11:45.727
I talked to this reporter last night. She
wanted to know the roadie's view of Dusty.

01:11:45.885 --> 01:11:49.480
She said she thought the
whole show was passé.

01:11:50.431 --> 01:11:52.650
What are you doing
talking to a reporter?

01:11:53.351 --> 01:11:55.399
She bought me a drink.

01:11:55.895 --> 01:11:58.444
You know, I got to
thinking afterwards...

01:11:59.023 --> 01:12:00.946
here I am saving the day...

01:12:01.359 --> 01:12:04.033
yet I'm not getting anything.
No one even knows it's me.

01:12:04.195 --> 01:12:06.163
No one's gonna know it either.

01:12:07.114 --> 01:12:09.162
- That was our agreement.
- I know.

01:12:10.201 --> 01:12:13.956
But everything happened so fast, I didn't
have a chance to think it through.

01:12:14.539 --> 01:12:15.836
I mean...

01:12:17.041 --> 01:12:20.636
I think I ought to get a
recording contract, at least.

01:12:21.921 --> 01:12:23.138
And money.

01:12:26.259 --> 01:12:28.307
How much money?

01:12:28.553 --> 01:12:29.770
A hundred grand.

01:12:35.142 --> 01:12:36.189
Yes?

01:12:36.477 --> 01:12:39.276
Oh. Hi, Sam.

01:12:40.565 --> 01:12:42.363
No.

01:12:42.692 --> 01:12:46.367
No, Dusty's not going to be making
it down to the station this trip.

01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.623
Yeah.

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:51.459
He's gonna be real
disappointed too.

01:12:52.785 --> 01:12:54.628
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

01:12:55.079 --> 01:12:57.878
No, I'm gonna send you
and the guys some CDs.

01:12:58.708 --> 01:13:01.052
Okay, you take good care.

01:13:02.086 --> 01:13:04.214
Okay, bye.

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:09.059
A hundred grand?

01:13:10.511 --> 01:13:13.139
You are out of your mind.

01:13:15.933 --> 01:13:17.810
You know, Lula,
it would have been...

01:13:17.977 --> 01:13:21.823
awful easy to tell that pretty
reporter the whole story last night.

01:13:21.981 --> 01:13:24.234
Don't you threaten me, Buddy.

01:14:04.774 --> 01:14:08.199
<i>That's the thoughts of a fool</i>

01:14:09.862 --> 01:14:12.285
<i>Thinking out loud</i>

01:14:14.408 --> 01:14:16.331
<i>She loved me so</i>

01:14:16.619 --> 01:14:17.666
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:14:17.828 --> 01:14:19.421
- Can I get a cold one?
- Yeah.

01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:22.129
<i>But I was untrue</i>

01:14:24.168 --> 01:14:27.263
<i>She's gone for good</i>

01:14:28.881 --> 01:14:31.851
<i>What can I do</i>

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:36.222
<i>That's the thoughts of a fool</i>

01:14:38.349 --> 01:14:39.441
<i>Thinking out loud</i>

01:14:39.684 --> 01:14:42.733
- Does Pete Shanks still own this joint?
- Yeah.

01:14:46.524 --> 01:14:49.404
<i>Okay, I'm gonna come down
there myself in the morning.</i>

01:14:49.527 --> 01:14:51.154
Just keep on him.

01:14:52.530 --> 01:14:53.873
Okay.

01:15:21.726 --> 01:15:24.605
<i>In all the world</i>

01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:29.901
<i>You will never find</i>

01:15:43.539 --> 01:15:45.667
So you really can
play that thing, huh?

01:15:45.833 --> 01:15:46.880
Two horses?

01:15:47.043 --> 01:15:49.171
He really needs a little exercise.

01:15:49.837 --> 01:15:53.137
J.W. usually helps me out,
but he's not up for riding.

01:15:53.758 --> 01:15:56.728
- And Tim's still out doing chores.
- So I guess I'm nominated.

01:15:57.261 --> 01:15:58.888
Well, if you don't mind.

01:15:59.680 --> 01:16:03.526
So how come a beautiful girl
like you isn't married?

01:16:04.226 --> 01:16:06.524
Well, I almost did once.

01:16:07.104 --> 01:16:08.731
What happened?

01:16:09.607 --> 01:16:13.453
This good-looking stranger
came into town...

01:16:14.987 --> 01:16:18.366
and he said all the right things
and did all the right things.

01:16:19.075 --> 01:16:22.625
- And then he went back.
- Back where?

01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:24.292
To his wife.

01:16:25.081 --> 01:16:27.925
- You didn't know?
- No, I didn't know.

01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:30.052
Of course.

01:16:30.336 --> 01:16:33.135
- I'm sorry, that was stupid.
- No, it's all right.

01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:35.303
I'm over it by now. It just...

01:16:35.549 --> 01:16:38.473
It makes you wary, you know?
Hard to trust people.

01:16:40.137 --> 01:16:41.684
I trust you, though.

01:16:42.848 --> 01:16:43.940
Why?

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:47.070
I don't know. Just
something about you.

01:16:48.813 --> 01:16:50.440
You married?

01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:52.487
No.

01:16:53.818 --> 01:16:55.445
You ever been married?

01:16:55.611 --> 01:16:56.658
No.

01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:35.659
- What the hell is that?
- I don't know.

01:17:50.124 --> 01:17:51.216
Hey, brother.

01:17:51.375 --> 01:17:55.721
- You look like you're doing all right.
- That's Earl. Earl, this is Harley Tucker.

01:17:55.880 --> 01:17:57.803
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

01:17:59.550 --> 01:18:01.052
I'll take the horses.

01:18:09.435 --> 01:18:14.692
You know, I hardly recognize you.
Clean-shaven, short hair. You look...

01:18:17.484 --> 01:18:18.701
pretty.

01:18:19.153 --> 01:18:20.279
Younger.

01:18:21.405 --> 01:18:25.330
I should've known you'd
find me. How'd you do it?

01:18:25.743 --> 01:18:29.919
Something to do with trees and roots.
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

01:18:30.372 --> 01:18:31.498
Grandma Ivy.

01:18:35.002 --> 01:18:37.972
- So you've been playing some?
- No.

01:18:42.927 --> 01:18:46.272
You're a flat lying
cur-dog, I tell you.

01:18:57.274 --> 01:19:01.780
<i>He talks to angels and
the stars start to spin</i>

01:19:03.155 --> 01:19:08.036
<i>He thinks of troubles
that he's gotten in</i>

01:19:09.745 --> 01:19:14.171
<i>He recalls how his heart got broken</i>

01:19:15.668 --> 01:19:19.593
<i>And how it's still that way</i>

01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:26.813
<i>The king of broken hearts
Doesn't know he's a king</i>

01:19:28.889 --> 01:19:32.689
<i>He's trying to forget other things</i>

01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:38.991
<i>Like some old chilly scenes</i>

01:19:41.402 --> 01:19:43.780
<i>He's walking through alone</i>

01:19:56.875 --> 01:19:59.628
I guess you two have
played together before.

01:20:01.005 --> 01:20:02.848
What, she doesn't know?

01:20:07.928 --> 01:20:10.556
Earl and I played in a
band back in the old days.

01:20:18.272 --> 01:20:21.276
Speaking of the old days, you'll
never guess where I went.

01:20:26.864 --> 01:20:30.869
<i>I'm gonna right a
great country wrong</i>

01:20:31.201 --> 01:20:33.954
That was quite a show you two
put on back at the ranch.

01:20:34.121 --> 01:20:35.418
It was fun.

01:20:35.789 --> 01:20:38.383
It was more fun than
I've had in a long time.

01:20:40.169 --> 01:20:42.638
You're quite a talented
man, Mr. Wyatt.

01:20:43.255 --> 01:20:45.178
And you're quite a
woman, Miss Harley.

01:20:45.341 --> 01:20:48.595
<i>I belong</i>

01:20:51.013 --> 01:20:56.315
<i>That I'm gonna right a
great country wrong</i>

01:21:02.775 --> 01:21:07.576
<i>Once upon a time
You had time to love me</i>

01:21:10.157 --> 01:21:15.414
<i>And once upon a time
I brought you pain</i>

01:21:17.581 --> 01:21:23.588
<i>if only we could
only start all over</i>

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:30.061
<i>I'd never leave your
loving arms again</i>

01:21:31.762 --> 01:21:37.769
<i>And I'm gonna right a
great country wrong</i>

01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:45.277
<i>I've never felt a
feeling quite so strong</i>

01:21:46.860 --> 01:21:50.285
<i>I'm gonna hold you till
the heartaches fade</i>

01:21:50.948 --> 01:21:54.043
<i>And all the pain is gone</i>

01:21:56.036 --> 01:22:02.043
<i>I'm gonna right a
great country wrong</i>

01:22:04.044 --> 01:22:09.016
<i>I'm gonna right a
great country wrong</i>

01:22:29.361 --> 01:22:30.908
I'll be right back.

01:22:31.613 --> 01:22:33.035
Yeah.

01:22:54.845 --> 01:22:58.270
<i>Mama used to tell me
Look before you leap</i>

01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:01.564
<i>I made a promise that I would
It's one I just can't keep</i>

01:23:02.019 --> 01:23:05.193
<i>Try to be careful
And look out for myself</i>

01:23:05.355 --> 01:23:08.700
<i>My mind is on my side
But my heart is something else</i>

01:23:09.234 --> 01:23:12.238
<i>Looking like it's
gone way over, yeah</i>

01:23:12.905 --> 01:23:15.658
<i>It pulled me down and tore me apart</i>

01:23:16.074 --> 01:23:19.169
<i>After all you put me through
I'm still in love with you</i>

01:23:19.745 --> 01:23:23.375
What's the matter with you? Haven't
you ever been in love before?

01:23:24.041 --> 01:23:25.418
Ahem.

01:23:30.631 --> 01:23:32.929
You like dancing with my husband?

01:23:39.431 --> 01:23:42.230
<i>Looking like it's
gone way over, yeah</i>

01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:45.733
<i>It pulled me down and tore me apart</i>

01:23:45.896 --> 01:23:49.366
<i>After all you put me through
I'm still in love with you</i>

01:23:49.733 --> 01:23:52.236
<i>I've got a crazy heart</i>

01:23:53.070 --> 01:23:57.416
<i>Crazy heart</i>

01:23:59.826 --> 01:24:03.296
- Come on, Grandpa. we're going home.
- What's the problem?

01:24:05.249 --> 01:24:07.217
You son of a bitch!

01:24:13.006 --> 01:24:14.599
How could you do it?

01:24:15.801 --> 01:24:17.929
How could you stand there...

01:24:18.387 --> 01:24:21.937
and look me straight in the
eye and lie to me like that?

01:24:22.307 --> 01:24:26.062
I just don't understand it.
I trusted you.

01:24:26.436 --> 01:24:27.688
Come on, we're going.

01:24:27.854 --> 01:24:30.107
- What the hell is wrong?
- Don't! Don't!

01:24:30.274 --> 01:24:32.948
I don't want to see you near
anybody in my family again!

01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:35.158
Do you understand me?

01:24:36.446 --> 01:24:37.538
No, I don't.

01:24:38.615 --> 01:24:41.539
<i>It pulled me down Tore me apart</i>

01:24:41.702 --> 01:24:45.457
<i>After all you put me through
I'm still in love with you</i>

01:24:45.622 --> 01:24:50.128
<i>I got a crazy heart
Now still being true</i>

01:24:50.627 --> 01:24:51.844
Oh, man.

01:25:06.184 --> 01:25:07.356
Dusty.

01:25:08.645 --> 01:25:10.363
It's time to come home.

01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:26.835
That's me. Underneath that
Dusty hat, that's me.

01:25:26.997 --> 01:25:30.877
<i>Where the sidewalk ends
And the road begins</i>

01:25:31.293 --> 01:25:36.345
<i>We said goodbye
On a cold dark night</i>

01:25:36.548 --> 01:25:38.926
<i>I'm not afraid to go</i>

01:25:52.022 --> 01:25:54.400
Harley, this is Wyatt.

01:25:59.154 --> 01:26:01.202
Man, I can't believe you two.

01:26:02.532 --> 01:26:04.284
Us two?

01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:12.301
I swear to God, Wyatt,
I had nothing to do with it.

01:26:12.459 --> 01:26:16.054
She must've had me followed
or something after I walked.

01:26:16.213 --> 01:26:18.807
Hell, you walked out. Went home.

01:26:19.675 --> 01:26:21.473
I followed you just...

01:26:23.053 --> 01:26:24.726
Just like I always do.

01:26:25.555 --> 01:26:28.058
How was I supposed to know
you didn't want to be found?

01:26:28.225 --> 01:26:30.398
I didn't even know myself.

01:26:33.647 --> 01:26:35.399
You should've made that
show in Shreveport.

01:26:35.565 --> 01:26:37.613
I intended to.

01:26:37.776 --> 01:26:40.029
- Things happen.
- Well, man...

01:26:41.321 --> 01:26:42.664
nobody missed you.

01:26:42.823 --> 01:26:46.418
Lula just cranked up the fire
on another dancing chicken.

01:26:49.746 --> 01:26:50.838
Lula.

01:26:52.207 --> 01:26:54.255
- Yep?
- I want to see Buddy Jackson.

01:26:54.418 --> 01:26:56.216
Haven't found him yet.

01:26:56.586 --> 01:26:57.929
Find him. Soon.

01:26:58.630 --> 01:27:00.598
You're certainly good at that.

01:27:03.593 --> 01:27:08.269
That Shreveport concert, I want you to
reschedule it. I'm gonna do it for free.

01:27:11.685 --> 01:27:14.438
If we do that, everyone will
know you weren't there.

01:27:14.604 --> 01:27:16.572
We can't let anyone know that.

01:27:17.899 --> 01:27:20.448
You don't know what I went
through to save your ass.

01:27:20.610 --> 01:27:24.535
Those people paid to see my show,
and that's what they're gonna get.

01:27:25.449 --> 01:27:29.044
What choice did you give me,
disappearing like that?

01:27:30.912 --> 01:27:35.634
Forget about me. You got a whole
band with families to support.

01:27:35.792 --> 01:27:38.887
Did you think about them
on your little holiday?

01:27:39.296 --> 01:27:41.469
They're the only reason I'm here.

01:27:42.257 --> 01:27:44.885
What are we doing out here?
Where are we going?

01:27:45.051 --> 01:27:46.644
Just taking a walk.

01:27:52.267 --> 01:27:54.770
You know what happened
while I was gone?

01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:58.732
I remembered I could
still play a guitar.

01:28:00.442 --> 01:28:01.864
And I can sing.

01:28:02.068 --> 01:28:04.036
And I remembered
I used to enjoy it.

01:28:04.196 --> 01:28:06.995
And I'm good at it, so
that's what I'm gonna do.

01:28:07.157 --> 01:28:09.580
I'm gonna play the guitar and sing.

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:11.662
No more smoke.

01:28:12.162 --> 01:28:16.008
No volcano blast. And
no more light shows.

01:28:17.751 --> 01:28:20.630
Just gonna stand on
that stage and sing?

01:28:21.838 --> 01:28:24.887
- Can the whole show?
- That's right.

01:28:26.301 --> 01:28:30.272
We've been doing this for a long time
together. You can do this with me...

01:28:31.139 --> 01:28:32.937
or I'll do it by myself.

01:28:40.690 --> 01:28:42.112
That's it.

01:28:58.708 --> 01:29:01.211
Whoa! Ugh!

01:29:11.221 --> 01:29:13.724
- You all right?
- I'm fine. I'm fine.

01:29:13.890 --> 01:29:15.733
- What was that?
- That was me.

01:29:16.560 --> 01:29:20.030
I wasn't concentrating. I just
can't concentrate, damn it.

01:29:20.188 --> 01:29:22.737
Just forget about him,
Harley. He's no good.

01:29:23.275 --> 01:29:25.949
You got a rodeo in
three days in Vegas.

01:29:26.111 --> 01:29:27.658
Get him out of your head.

01:29:27.821 --> 01:29:29.823
I wish I'd broken his jaw.

01:29:55.599 --> 01:29:58.978
<i>Today, an entertainment exclusive.
It's Milli Vanilli in reverse.</i>

01:29:59.144 --> 01:30:03.399
<i>A member of country superstar Dusty's
road crew reveals an amazing secret.</i>

01:30:03.565 --> 01:30:06.284
<i>Yes, I impersonated the guy
through the whole concert.</i>

01:30:06.443 --> 01:30:08.286
The TV! Quick! Come here!

01:30:08.945 --> 01:30:12.825
<i>The band was live, but the voice was
on tape and I lip-synched to it.</i>

01:30:12.991 --> 01:30:15.369
<i>See, his manager offered
me a hundred...</i>

01:30:15.535 --> 01:30:19.961
<i>Lula Rogers offered me $100,000 and a
recording contract if I'd keep doing it.</i>

01:30:20.123 --> 01:30:21.796
That's him.

01:30:21.958 --> 01:30:23.801
<i>But she changed her mind?</i>

01:30:24.169 --> 01:30:26.171
<i>Maybe she found somebody else.</i>

01:30:26.338 --> 01:30:29.558
<i>There's no telling how many
different guys she used before me.</i>

01:30:29.716 --> 01:30:33.095
<i>- Where's the real Dusty?
- That, I don't know.</i>

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:36.686
<i>Dusty ends his phenomenally
successful road tour this weekend...</i>

01:30:36.848 --> 01:30:38.976
<i>at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas.</i>

01:30:39.142 --> 01:30:42.487
<i>Country Music Network will be
there to answer the question:</i>

01:30:42.646 --> 01:30:45.274
<i>Is it Dusty, or is it Memorex?</i>

01:30:46.316 --> 01:30:52.039
<i>We'll be back with more from Country Music
Network after these brief messages.</i>

01:32:20.660 --> 01:32:24.164
Okay. This is Monique James,
Country Music Network...

01:32:24.330 --> 01:32:27.004
and we'll try once again for
an interview in a minute.

01:32:38.386 --> 01:32:40.388
I owe all of y'all an apology.

01:32:41.264 --> 01:32:44.609
I put each of you here in this
room in a difficult position...

01:32:44.768 --> 01:32:47.237
leaving the way I did,
and for that I'm sorry.

01:32:47.937 --> 01:32:51.282
I guess I kind of lost track of...

01:32:51.608 --> 01:32:53.531
what our real job was.

01:32:54.944 --> 01:32:56.742
Maybe we all did.

01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:58.782
In the early days...

01:32:59.032 --> 01:33:02.332
it was all about the music.
We did it because we loved it.

01:33:02.494 --> 01:33:06.624
Lately, it seems like it's
just for the smoke...

01:33:08.124 --> 01:33:10.673
and the glitz and the money.

01:33:10.835 --> 01:33:15.056
And it's real easy to get caught
up in that. I know I did.

01:33:15.632 --> 01:33:17.225
I think We all did.

01:33:18.968 --> 01:33:23.348
That's what happened to Buddy Jackson.
And that's why he did what he did.

01:33:23.515 --> 01:33:26.564
We got a lot of fans out there
who don't trust us anymore...

01:33:26.726 --> 01:33:29.400
and tonight I'd like to
get that trust back.

01:33:30.814 --> 01:33:33.533
I want to thank y'all for coming
in and staying with me...

01:33:33.691 --> 01:33:37.412
and I'd like to see the band in
my room later on this afternoon.

01:35:14.959 --> 01:35:17.087
Harley, I need to talk to you.

01:35:21.341 --> 01:35:23.890
This has just been a
big misunderstanding.

01:35:24.135 --> 01:35:27.435
Harley told you she
don't want you around.

01:35:27.597 --> 01:35:30.271
Can't you at least
respect her that much?

01:35:30.934 --> 01:35:35.656
Look, she's told you once, don't come
around. She don't want you anymore.

01:35:36.105 --> 01:35:37.357
Ernest.

01:35:44.530 --> 01:35:50.253
You know, it's a funny thing about that
little white speck on top of chicken shit.

01:35:52.789 --> 01:35:55.838
That little white speck
is chicken shit too.

01:36:01.547 --> 01:36:05.893
<i>Fans, as the competition's been
keen here in Las Vegas this week...</i>

01:36:06.052 --> 01:36:10.023
<i>remember the City of Neons brings
you the best rodeo in the world.</i>

01:36:10.682 --> 01:36:13.481
<i>We've got cowboys and cowgirls
from all over the world...</i>

01:36:13.643 --> 01:36:17.693
<i>but we've got a beautiful lady from the
state of Texas that'll be next to go:</i>

01:36:18.147 --> 01:36:19.444
<i>Harley Tucker.</i>

01:36:19.774 --> 01:36:24.120
<i>The time of 16.30 is what we're
running after for the big bucks.</i>

01:36:24.946 --> 01:36:29.497
<i>Here comes your pretty lady, Harley Tucker.
One turn to the right, two to the left.</i>

01:36:29.659 --> 01:36:33.709
<i>Las Vegas, get ready to have a
Texas lady take the money home!</i>

01:36:34.205 --> 01:36:38.301
<i>One more turn to the left and we're gonna
be that horserace fast, happen right here.</i>

01:36:38.584 --> 01:36:42.179
<i>We're off and running!
And the number is 16.30.</i>

01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:46.180
<i>And the clock, we're
looking at 16.26!</i>

01:36:46.509 --> 01:36:50.355
<i>That's what it's all
about, folks. All right.</i>

01:36:56.853 --> 01:36:58.855
What did you tell her?

01:37:00.398 --> 01:37:02.366
I was just calling you.

01:37:05.486 --> 01:37:06.533
Dusty.

01:37:08.031 --> 01:37:11.285
- Well, how you doing, Buddy?
- I'm doing great.

01:37:12.493 --> 01:37:15.713
- You're not so smart, are you, Buddy?
- How's that?

01:37:15.872 --> 01:37:19.217
- This little charade you been pulling.
- I don't know.

01:37:19.375 --> 01:37:21.377
I'm getting an awful lot
of media attention.

01:37:21.544 --> 01:37:24.263
I can barely keep reporters
from knocking down my door.

01:37:24.422 --> 01:37:26.015
I'm a pretty popular man.

01:37:26.215 --> 01:37:28.434
Everybody knows who I am.
That's pretty smart.

01:37:28.593 --> 01:37:31.517
Yeah, but I think you're
forgetting a little something.

01:37:31.929 --> 01:37:35.103
- Like what?
- Like a little matter of fraud.

01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:39.855
That fraud you been committing
on 60,000 unsuspecting fans.

01:37:40.646 --> 01:37:44.901
Especially when Lula here offers you all
that money and a recording contract.

01:37:45.401 --> 01:37:46.573
Come to think of it...

01:37:46.736 --> 01:37:49.910
- I think that qualifies as extortion too.
- What?

01:37:50.073 --> 01:37:53.668
Of course the only person who'd
have to press charges is me.

01:37:53.826 --> 01:37:56.124
- Wait. She didn't give me any money.
- What?

01:37:56.579 --> 01:38:00.675
- You mean you've been lying to the press?
- Hold on, Dusty.

01:38:00.833 --> 01:38:04.838
No, you hold on. I want
you to disappear, Buddy.

01:38:05.004 --> 01:38:08.099
If I ever hear of you making
another comment to the press...

01:38:08.257 --> 01:38:11.727
if I ever see your face
around country music again...

01:38:11.886 --> 01:38:15.436
I'll sue you so fast you
won't believe it. Now go on.

01:38:15.807 --> 01:38:17.400
Get your ass out of here.

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:22.609
- Can he do that?
- Yeah.

01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:32.123
Go on.

01:38:32.782 --> 01:38:34.705
Get your ass out of here.

01:38:39.872 --> 01:38:41.840
This isn't over yet.

01:38:43.918 --> 01:38:45.386
Yeah, it is.

01:38:52.969 --> 01:38:54.061
Thanks.

01:39:00.101 --> 01:39:01.728
Harley Tucker.

01:39:05.148 --> 01:39:07.742
- Yeah.
- Hi, I've got some tickets for you.

01:39:08.276 --> 01:39:09.994
- Tickets?
- Who is it?

01:39:10.194 --> 01:39:12.697
I'll pick you up in
the limousine at 7.

01:39:13.531 --> 01:39:17.661
- Limousine? You got the wrong room.
- There must be some mistake here.

01:39:17.827 --> 01:39:19.170
Are you the Tuckers?

01:39:19.328 --> 01:39:22.332
Harley, J.W., Tim and Ernest?

01:39:23.207 --> 01:39:24.959
- Yeah.
- No mistake.

01:40:16.344 --> 01:40:17.766
Whoa!

01:40:31.442 --> 01:40:34.286
<i>We're live at the Mirage
Hotel in Las Vegas...</i>

01:40:34.445 --> 01:40:37.790
where recent allegations by former
staff member, Buddy Jackson...

01:40:37.949 --> 01:40:40.247
have left Dusty fans in a turmoil.

01:40:40.660 --> 01:40:44.665
We were unable to speak with Dusty,
but his long-time manager, Lula Rogers...

01:40:44.830 --> 01:40:48.676
promised he is here and he is ready
to give the best Dusty show ever.

01:40:50.169 --> 01:40:51.921
Look at these seats.

01:40:53.297 --> 01:40:54.594
Enjoy the show.

01:40:56.509 --> 01:40:58.932
- Are you Miss Harley Tucker?
- Yes.

01:40:59.095 --> 01:41:02.315
Could you come with me, please?
Someone would like to speak with you.

01:41:03.099 --> 01:41:04.442
I'll be back.

01:41:09.480 --> 01:41:10.982
- Mrs. Chandler?
- Yes.

01:41:11.315 --> 01:41:15.365
- Hope your ride from the airport was all right.
- Just fine, thank you.

01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:19.665
Shorter the ride, the longer
the car. Showbiz.

01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:12.843
What's going on?

01:42:37.985 --> 01:42:40.363
Wyatt, I know this doesn't...

01:42:41.030 --> 01:42:42.532
change anything...

01:42:44.492 --> 01:42:46.870
but I just wanted to apologize.

01:42:48.579 --> 01:42:51.207
Next to Earl, Lula,
you're my oldest friend.

01:42:52.166 --> 01:42:53.884
You're due a few mistakes.

01:42:55.753 --> 01:42:57.596
You knock 'em dead.

01:43:13.729 --> 01:43:14.901
Let's do it.

01:43:16.565 --> 01:43:19.739

Thank you.

01:44:07.616 --> 01:44:09.084
Thank you very much.

01:44:09.785 --> 01:44:14.131
I gotta do something a little different
tonight, so if you'll indulge me this...

01:44:14.290 --> 01:44:16.384
I'll appreciate it very much.

01:44:16.625 --> 01:44:20.550
Could you follow me with the spotlight
right down here in front please?

01:45:08.010 --> 01:45:10.388
<i>Our love is unconditional</i>

I'll make yours just as sweet</i>

It's as far as we can see</i>

<i>So let's make each tomorrow
Be the best that it can be</i>

01:46:51.363 --> 01:46:56.620
<i>I cross my heart and promise to</i>

01:46:58.621 --> 01:47:04.173
<i>Give all I've got to give
To make all your dreams come true</i>
