06:50.661 --> 06:53.413

07:02.963 --> 07:04.094
It's complicated.

07:04.094 --> 07:05.466
And it dates back to a time
 when slave-owners

07:05.466 --> 07:09.349
like Thomas Jefferson
 invited/ordered

07:09.349 --> 07:12.553
their slaves like Sally Hemings
 up to their chambers,

Well, crazier offensive origin,
 because the word "mulatto"

07:21.151 --> 07:23.614
derived from the Spanish word
 for mule.

07:23.614 --> 07:25.696
But being mulatto
 had another side to it.

07:25.696 --> 07:27.027

with the Civil Rights Movement,

 biracial people

07:44.885 --> 07:47.347
to embrace their heritage.

07:47.347 --> 07:51.011
Suddenly, being any kind
 of black was the new black.

07:51.011 --> 07:54.555
One of the biggest wins
 of the movement was in 1967,

07:54.555 --> 07:56.396
when the Loving
 v. Virginia case

07:56.396 --> 07:58.559

[ Normal voice ] Hold on.
Wait -- wait a minute.

17:11.241 --> 17:12.862
Um...

17:12.862 --> 17:15.994
Yes, we stopped doing work
for days,

17:15.994 --> 17:20.710
but that is what's great
about the Surface, Kelly.

17:20.710 --> 17:22.622
It allows you
to do everything.

17:22.622 --> 17:27.587
The Microsoft Surface --

17:27.587 --> 17:31.761
It's what you work on even
when you are not doing work.

17:31.761 --> 17:32.972
Hm.

17:32.972 --> 17:35.014
Mm?
-[ Gasps ]

17:39.639 --> 17:40.940
You've got to be kidding me.

17:40.940 --> 17:42.352
-Okay.
-Okay. Well, you know,

17:42.352 --> 17:43.773
I swung for the fences.

17:43.773 --> 17:46.146
Listen, guys, if you're not
gonna be able to focus,

17:46.146 --> 17:48.148
I'm gonna have to rethink
this entire relationship.

17:48.148 --> 17:49.399
-Whoa, whoa, Kelly.
-Please don't.

17:49.399 --> 17:50.950
-I really think you're just --
-[ Clears throat ]

17:52.322 --> 17:53.493
John Mayer?

17:53.493 --> 17:54.904
Tonight?

17:54.904 --> 17:56.196
I didn't even know
he was touring.

17:56.196 --> 17:57.827
Charlie:
Pick you up at 8:00?

17:57.827 --> 17:59.619
Can you make it 8:30?

17:59.619 --> 18:02.542
It was probably gonna be
around that time anyway.

18:02.542 --> 18:04.914
Let me walk you out.
[ Chuckles ]

18:04.914 --> 18:06.666
I think we gonna be fine.

18:06.666 --> 18:08.798
So, how close are you
to your father?

18:10.590 --> 18:12.802
Rainbow: [ Gasps ]
Oh, my God. Dad.

18:12.802 --> 18:15.475
What?
 [ Laughs ]
Okay, these are amazing.

18:15.475 --> 18:17.347
Awe, look how adorable
I am here.

18:17.347 --> 18:18.348
That's your brother.

18:18.348 --> 18:19.769
It is?
 Mm-hmm.

18:19.769 --> 18:23.643
Oops. Oh, God,
we look so much alike.

18:23.643 --> 18:25.685
So, Dad, I came out here

18:25.685 --> 18:27.527
'cause I want to talk to you
about something important.

18:27.527 --> 18:30.190
Is is the fact that I live in
a bus that runs on human waste?

18:30.190 --> 18:33.283
Nope. I gave up on that battle
a long time ago, Dad.
 Oh, oh, okay.

18:33.283 --> 18:35.034
I wanted to ask you
a question.
 Yeah.

18:35.034 --> 18:38.738
Junior came home
with a girlfriend,

18:38.738 --> 18:41.371
she's white,
and it totally freaked me out.

18:41.371 --> 18:43.042
What?!
 I know. God, I know.

18:43.042 --> 18:45.084
I'm so ashamed of myself.
 Junior has a girlfriend?

18:45.084 --> 18:46.456
Did you have
some kind of party for him?

18:46.456 --> 18:49.589
This should be celebrated --
wildly, joyously.

18:49.589 --> 18:51.551
Dad, did you hear
what I said?

18:51.551 --> 18:52.752
The kid wears capes.

18:52.752 --> 18:54.254
Yeah. [ Chuckles ]

18:54.254 --> 18:56.846
No, Bow-Bow, I get it.

18:56.846 --> 19:00.220
A mother often sees
who her son's with

19:00.220 --> 19:02.602
as a reflection of herself.
 Mm.

19:02.602 --> 19:03.563
You're a black woman.

19:03.563 --> 19:06.266
So Junior bringing home
a white girl,

19:06.266 --> 19:08.938
it's making you feel
a certain way.

19:08.938 --> 19:11.231
Dad.
 Mm?

19:11.231 --> 19:12.692
You see me
as a black woman?

19:12.692 --> 19:14.404
Well, that's what you are,
sweetie.

19:14.404 --> 19:17.907
Yeah, but you're my dad
and you are white

19:17.907 --> 19:20.039
and that's half of me.
Right?

19:20.039 --> 19:22.081
And I love that half of me.

19:22.081 --> 19:24.834
So do I.
And nothing can change that.

19:24.834 --> 19:27.417
But look at this.
Yeah.

19:27.417 --> 19:28.708
Remember this day?

19:28.708 --> 19:30.380
Oh, yeah, I do.

19:30.380 --> 19:32.672
All the awkward stares
and comments

19:32.672 --> 19:34.554
from people who didn't think
I was your father?

19:34.554 --> 19:36.506
Well, I knew then,

19:36.506 --> 19:39.008
way before you had a chance
to decide for yourself,

19:39.008 --> 19:41.641
that the world had already made
that choice for you.

19:41.641 --> 19:44.394
You were black.

19:44.394 --> 19:46.606
God, I struggled with that
so much growing up.

19:47.977 --> 19:50.980
But you did --
you got through it.

19:50.980 --> 19:53.693
Wow.
 Eventually, you met Dre.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.525
You fell in love.

19:55.525 --> 19:58.117
And you had that big,
beautiful family of yours.

19:58.117 --> 20:02.081
My big, beautiful,
black family.

20:02.081 --> 20:05.665
But now, because Junior likes
a white girl,

20:05.665 --> 20:09.379
it feels like, uh...
a rejection.

20:09.379 --> 20:12.252
Exactly.
That's exactly it.
 Yeah.

20:12.252 --> 20:14.634
Yeah, and it's making you
second-guess

20:14.634 --> 20:16.426
the choices
that you've made.

20:16.426 --> 20:17.927
Here --
here's the thing, love.

20:17.927 --> 20:20.470
You know who you are.

20:20.470 --> 20:22.262
I know who I am.

20:24.103 --> 20:25.184
Thank you.

20:26.516 --> 20:28.308
[ Chuckles ]

20:29.809 --> 20:31.401
So there it was.

20:31.401 --> 20:34.694
I had to go back to my past
 to look at my future.

20:36.526 --> 20:37.527
Thanks, Dad.

20:42.952 --> 20:44.534
Ta-da!

20:44.534 --> 20:47.747
Well, what do you think
of your new room?

20:47.747 --> 20:49.539
-It's nice.
-Nice?

20:49.539 --> 20:53.132
Yeah, it's just --
something feels off.

20:53.132 --> 20:54.464
Yeah.

20:54.464 --> 20:57.587
What? It's everything
you asked for.

20:57.587 --> 21:01.591
Fashionable beds, accent
pillows, privacy partition --

21:01.591 --> 21:05.305
it's totally grown up --
the opposite of a baby room.

21:05.305 --> 21:08.097
You're right.
Totally grown up.

21:08.097 --> 21:11.020
Yeah,
no more kid stuff.

21:12.442 --> 21:13.853
You know what?

21:13.853 --> 21:17.156
There's actually one thing
I forgot to add.

21:18.398 --> 21:20.159
There it is.

21:20.159 --> 21:22.161
Now I know
which bed is mine.

21:22.161 --> 21:23.533
I need that "J."
