WEBVTT

00:23.023 --> 00:26.443
Another day
Of living in the middle of it all

00:26.527 --> 00:27.778
Hey, don't poop there.

00:27.861 --> 00:31.907
Another journey uptown
On the 6 from City Hall

00:31.990 --> 00:33.033
Salami, huh?

00:33.116 --> 00:36.286
While buses leave
With all the other boys and girls

00:36.370 --> 00:41.917
We go to the park
To live among the squirrels

00:42.000 --> 00:45.420
We go to Central Park

00:45.504 --> 00:48.507
It's the private place we share

00:48.590 --> 00:52.761
-It's normal that we live here
-Central Park

00:52.845 --> 00:57.015
-And I watch from over there
-You know we have to live here

00:57.099 --> 00:59.810
I'm of course your narrator

00:59.893 --> 01:03.355
Which is still your favorite part

01:10.737 --> 01:14.491
Back in Central Park

01:14.575 --> 01:19.121
It's in the middle of the city

01:19.204 --> 01:22.624
Central Park

01:25.377 --> 01:26.378
Look at them.

01:26.461 --> 01:30.299
The first family of Central Park.
Love these guys. Love them.

01:30.382 --> 01:33.468
I could hide in a bush outside their house
and look at them through a window forever.

01:33.552 --> 01:35.012
But first, Bitsy.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.930
This is a quintessentially New York story,

01:37.014 --> 01:40.058
and what better way to start
a New York story than in New Jersey?

01:40.893 --> 01:43.312
New Jersey. The fart cloud of Manhattan.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.022
That's very poetic.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.065
-Where exactly are we anyway?
-Weehawken.

01:47.149 --> 01:50.194
-Weehawken? More like we-stinkin'.
-You wanna turn around?

01:50.277 --> 01:52.279
What? And miss giving
my hilarious keynote speech

01:52.362 --> 01:54.239
at the Hotel Owners Association meeting

01:54.323 --> 01:57.409
where all my competitors and
worst enemies are in one place? No.

01:57.492 --> 02:00.078
When they find out what I've got cooking,

02:00.162 --> 02:03.415
they're gonna line up
at Bitsy's soup kitchen for a handout,

02:03.498 --> 02:06.001
and I'll say, "Get away from my soup.
It's made for me."

02:06.084 --> 02:07.085
Now I want soup.

02:07.169 --> 02:09.545
I still don't think what you're
planning to do is a very good idea.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.924
Sorry, Ms. Brandenham.
Traffic's a nightmare.

02:12.007 --> 02:14.426
-Quite the chatterbox today, huh, Jarvis?
-Sorry?

02:14.510 --> 02:16.345
There he goes again. This place sucks.

02:16.428 --> 02:19.223
If you turn left down that alley, the one
with the dumpster, there's a shortcut.

02:19.306 --> 02:20.974
How could you possibly know that?

02:21.058 --> 02:23.894
Are you an associate professor
of crap-hole towns?

02:23.977 --> 02:25.312
I'm from Weehawken.

02:25.395 --> 02:28.190
Oh, cool. Good for you. Such a cool place.

02:28.273 --> 02:29.983
-It may not look like much.
-It doesn't.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.737
Hey, Bitsy, I'm from this city
So please watch how you're talking

02:33.820 --> 02:35.280
It's home to me
I love this town

02:35.364 --> 02:37.074
Let me tell you about Weehawken
Now listen

02:37.157 --> 02:39.117
With all due respect
This town's better than you'd expect

02:39.201 --> 02:40.494
Never gonna meet a more friendly bunch

02:40.577 --> 02:42.454
And, oh, so many great spots for lunch

02:42.538 --> 02:44.915
Weehawken, that's quite the name
An indigenous word for the Palisades

02:44.998 --> 02:46.375
Or kinda like that
It's complicated

02:46.458 --> 02:47.793
And by that, I mean appropriated

02:47.876 --> 02:49.253
Anyhoo, did I mention the view?

02:49.336 --> 02:50.462
Narrows to the G-dub
It's whoo

02:50.546 --> 02:52.256
It's the best spot in the NoHu

02:52.339 --> 02:53.507
Jersey pride, y'all, let me show you

02:53.590 --> 02:55.884
Because I'm from Weehawken

02:55.968 --> 02:58.387
All day we jaywalking

02:58.470 --> 03:00.931
Living high up on the Palisades

03:01.014 --> 03:03.934
Everybody be flocking
To Weehawken

03:04.017 --> 03:07.020
You know I'm from Weehawken

03:07.104 --> 03:09.606
Manhattan, keep gawking

03:09.690 --> 03:12.109
Hit the ferry as it casts away

03:12.192 --> 03:15.237
Hudson River be rocking
In Weehawken

03:15.320 --> 03:17.322
When we walk
We walking tall

03:17.406 --> 03:18.532
Weehawken, New Jersey, y'all

03:18.615 --> 03:21.410
Yes, I'm proud of the pedigree
Who's from Weehawken just like me?

03:21.493 --> 03:22.661
Fred Astaire
Shake it there

03:22.744 --> 03:24.121
Smell that fish up in the air

03:24.204 --> 03:25.581
Daniel Webster goes way back

03:25.664 --> 03:26.957
And that lady that sang "Love Shack"

03:27.040 --> 03:29.543
Pause it there, I love her hair
I wonder where she gets it done

03:29.626 --> 03:31.753
That's one more thing about this town
We've got such great salons

03:31.837 --> 03:32.838
Can't help but brag

03:32.921 --> 03:35.465
And our history's so cool
We're the home of the Hamilton-Burr duel

03:35.549 --> 03:37.092
There's a park and a plaque
It's top-notch

03:37.176 --> 03:38.385
This spot's where Hamilton got shot

03:38.468 --> 03:40.721
What's good, everybody on The Bluff?
See, that's where I grew up

03:40.804 --> 03:43.557
I gotta shout out Weehawken High's
Young Ladies Euchre Club, woot, woot!

03:43.640 --> 03:46.101
Our traffic? Slow-motion
Our neighbor? Hoboken

03:46.185 --> 03:49.104
We use gender-neutral pronouns
Our population is woken

03:49.188 --> 03:51.899
It smells like the ocean
And I'm sorry for the self-promotion

03:51.982 --> 03:54.568
But when I walk out on Hackensack
I gush out with emotion

03:54.651 --> 03:57.446
Because I'm from Weehawken

03:57.529 --> 03:59.948
All day we jaywalking

04:00.032 --> 04:02.034
Living high up on the Palisades

04:02.117 --> 04:04.578
Everybody be flocking
To Weehawken

04:04.661 --> 04:06.538
You know I'm from Weehawken

04:06.622 --> 04:08.457
Manhattan, keep gawking

04:08.540 --> 04:11.210
Hit the ferry as it casts away
Hudson River be rocking

04:12.294 --> 04:16.214
In Weehawken

04:16.298 --> 04:18.926
Because we're from Weehawken

04:19.009 --> 04:21.678
This township is rocking

04:21.762 --> 04:23.972
Living high up on the Palisades

04:24.056 --> 04:26.808
Opportunity's knocking
In Weehawken

04:26.892 --> 04:29.978
You know we're from Weehawken

04:30.062 --> 04:32.272
Manhattan, we're mocking

04:32.356 --> 04:34.775
Broin' out
While we're pumping weights

04:34.858 --> 04:38.445
We are proud to be
Weehawken

04:38.529 --> 04:41.240
That's why we should go down that alley.
Save us, like, ten minutes.

04:41.323 --> 04:43.492
I don't take directions from not me.

04:43.575 --> 04:46.036
Just keep honking the horn.
Show them we're serious.

04:46.537 --> 04:47.663
Okay, people.

04:47.746 --> 04:51.500
We're two minutes out.
Molly, two minutes to Gina Tracker, FBI.

04:51.583 --> 04:54.920
I'm so excited. What happened
to Tracker after that crazy season finale?

04:55.003 --> 04:56.129
Do you think she'll make it out alive?

04:56.213 --> 04:58.715
Cole, if there's one thing I know
about Gina Tracker, FBI,

04:58.799 --> 05:00.467
it's that she always finds a way.

05:00.551 --> 05:01.677
Also she's good at tracking.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.595
-Did it start yet?
-No, but it's starting any second.

05:03.679 --> 05:04.680
Okay, well, real quick,

05:04.763 --> 05:07.850
I have one non-Gina Tracker, FBI related
piece of business to discuss.

05:07.933 --> 05:10.811
Since the show's about to start, feel free
to not think about it too carefully,

05:10.894 --> 05:12.980
but I was wondering if
I could go to a concert tomorrow night

05:13.063 --> 05:14.398
with Brendan without a chaperone?

05:14.481 --> 05:16.817
No chaperone? Interesting. Interesting.

05:16.900 --> 05:18.944
Casual dad over here, casually processing.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.821
It's just the two of us having a good time

05:20.904 --> 05:23.198
with a couple thousand
other people in a well-lit arena.

05:23.282 --> 05:25.951
Just listening to music,
applauding at the appropriate moments,

05:26.034 --> 05:27.244
perhaps drinking a soda pop.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.329
Previously on Gina Tracker, FBI.

05:29.413 --> 05:30.581
I don't know.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.666
-We trust you. But--
-We'll think about it, okay?

05:32.749 --> 05:34.251
Is it because of the soda pop?
I can have water.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.086
Total silence starting this instant.

05:36.170 --> 05:38.338
Damn it, Tracker. It's no use.
The track's gone cold.

05:38.422 --> 05:39.840
I've never seen a cold trail.

05:39.923 --> 05:42.259
Except for that time
in Glacier National Park in January.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.844
Because of the snow, which is cold.

05:43.927 --> 05:47.181
How cute are they,
watching their little show together?

05:47.264 --> 05:49.099
Too bad
they're not gonna get to finish it.

05:49.183 --> 05:51.935
Have I shocked you?
Well, let's just say you'll see.

05:52.019 --> 05:53.645
Or should I say, "You won't see"?

05:53.729 --> 05:57.274
That will feel very clever later when
you know what's going on. Until then--

05:57.357 --> 05:58.358
Tracker got a haircut!

05:59.359 --> 06:01.862
The Tri-State Hoteliers
Association Conference.

06:02.613 --> 06:05.157
You could power a rocket
with how much I hate these people.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.075
There's Leslie Portergrave.

06:07.159 --> 06:09.703
-Dory Sterling.
-Buy it. Buy it now.

06:09.786 --> 06:10.954
Bury it. Bury it now.

06:11.038 --> 06:14.041
And there's Marriott J. Courtyard.
Bunch of rich, greedy twerps.

06:14.124 --> 06:15.792
And what's the deal
with these centerpieces?

06:15.876 --> 06:17.252
Are they little overflowing toilets?

06:17.336 --> 06:19.213
I believe those
are chocolate fondue fountains.

06:19.296 --> 06:20.297
No, they're toilets.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.341
They really decided to have
the hotelier conference

06:22.424 --> 06:23.717
at the worst hotel in the world.

06:23.800 --> 06:26.053
It's old, crusty and smells like farts.

06:26.678 --> 06:28.055
Doesn't remind me of anybody.

06:28.138 --> 06:29.723
Oh, great. Here comes Portergrave.

06:29.806 --> 06:34.228
Bitsy, have you gotten smaller?
They say that happens before you die.

06:34.311 --> 06:36.772
I see you're desperately
trying to pretend you're young

06:36.855 --> 06:38.106
because you have a hotel in Brooklyn,

06:38.190 --> 06:40.192
which is suddenly cool
for some stupid reason.

06:40.275 --> 06:41.652
Probably because it's so lame.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.487
Are you up to your ass in summer scarves?

06:43.570 --> 06:46.532
Your jokes are as tired
and played out as Manhattan.

06:46.615 --> 06:49.368
As if people still go there.
What is this, 1995?

06:49.451 --> 06:51.745
You look like a corpse
buried in his grandson's clothing.

06:51.828 --> 06:54.414
I'm just trying to stay in touch
with the youth culture.

06:54.498 --> 06:55.541
Tell your face.

06:56.041 --> 06:57.084
Same old Bitsy.

06:57.167 --> 06:58.544
We'll see about that.

06:59.419 --> 07:03.841
And now to deliver tonight's
keynote address, Bitsy Brandenham.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.093
Thank you, thank you.
What an honor it is...

07:06.969 --> 07:08.053
for you to have me here.

07:08.136 --> 07:11.640
Year after year, I drag myself
to this ridiculous conference

07:11.723 --> 07:12.850
and suffer through it.

07:12.933 --> 07:15.435
But now it's time for some truth.
Your hotels suck.

07:15.519 --> 07:18.564
Leslie Portergrave, your hotel
is only 30 stories tall. Pathetic.

07:18.647 --> 07:20.774
Dory Sterling,
your hotel looks like a weird penis.

07:20.858 --> 07:22.901
My hotel looks like a good penis.

07:22.985 --> 07:26.071
But seriously, folks, I'm actually glad
you're all gathered in one place.

07:26.154 --> 07:28.198
I know what you people say
about the Brandenham.

07:28.282 --> 07:31.952
That it's old-fashioned, uncool,
drafty, moldy, smells like goulash.

07:32.035 --> 07:34.830
Well, today I'm going to show you
exactly who's got the beef.

07:34.913 --> 07:38.166
I've obtained the city's top-secret
infrastructure projects.

07:38.250 --> 07:40.919
With these plans,
I'll be able to buy up cheap real estate

07:41.003 --> 07:44.381
that soon won't be cheap real estate,
'cause it'll be superhot real estate.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.885
It's the skeleton key to the best
investments over the next ten years.

07:47.968 --> 07:49.803
Wanna see? There you go. Too fast?

07:49.887 --> 07:51.805
Here, take another look.
Too quick, didn't see it?

07:51.889 --> 07:53.223
So sad. So much money at stake.

07:53.307 --> 07:55.601
As I may have mentioned
in my opening remarks,

07:55.684 --> 07:58.437
your hotel sucks, your hotel sucks
and your hotel sucks.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.022
Your hotel's pretty good.
Just kidding. It sucks!

08:00.355 --> 08:03.942
-Tracker, what took you so long?
-I had to change into a fresh tracksuit.

08:04.026 --> 08:06.153
Wow. Running.
I did not see that coming.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.488
I love this show. I love this show!

08:08.572 --> 08:11.074
I've never read Shakespeare, but I'm
assuming this is slightly higher quality.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.076
Do you think she'll track him down?
Or do you think he'll get away?

08:13.160 --> 08:15.579
I mean, she usually does,
but maybe this is the week she doesn't.

08:15.662 --> 08:17.414
And where is she running?
I don't know! I don't know!

08:17.497 --> 08:19.166
Look at us. Loving TV together.

08:19.249 --> 08:21.084
Does any other family love TV together?

08:21.168 --> 08:24.171
Are we possibly the best family ever,
having the best night ever?

08:24.254 --> 08:26.882
Family means togetherne--

08:29.593 --> 08:31.678
Your hotel doesn't just suck,
it super sucks.

08:32.429 --> 08:35.307
What happened? Did I scorch
everyone too hard and we blew a fuse?

08:35.390 --> 08:37.017
-Oh, no.
-Mom, make TV come back.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.895
I can't. Maybe I can. TV, on!
Nope, didn't work.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.188
If I don't find out
what happened to Tracker, I'll die.

08:42.272 --> 08:43.732
Me too, son. Me too.

08:43.815 --> 08:47.110
Remember when I said you wouldn't see it?
Pretty clever, huh?

08:47.194 --> 08:49.655
Moth! Or baby bat!
Is it a moth or baby bat?

08:49.738 --> 08:50.989
I think it's a blackout.

08:51.073 --> 08:53.534
Too bad.
I still had ten minutes of material left.

08:53.617 --> 08:56.453
I think they got the gist.
Everyone in this room hates your guts.

08:56.537 --> 08:57.538
You're just being nice.

08:57.621 --> 08:59.748
Come on. We're done here.
Let's get the hell out of Weehawken.

08:59.831 --> 09:02.209
That's right.
This is a New York City blackout.

09:02.292 --> 09:04.962
And you know what that means?
Things can get a little dark.

09:05.045 --> 09:07.506
Are you scared? You should be.
I mean, I'm not.

09:07.589 --> 09:11.009
Oh, my God, bats! Or moths!
I can't tell! It's too dark!

09:12.803 --> 09:16.431
Come into the darkness
Follow me

09:16.515 --> 09:20.018
Right in front of your face
You can't see a thing

09:20.102 --> 09:23.605
Blinded by the darkness
Your head starts to spin

09:23.689 --> 09:26.692
Was that a murdery guy?
Or was it just the wind?

09:27.276 --> 09:30.028
Wait. What was that?
What in the hell was that?

09:31.154 --> 09:35.409
You have no choice
If you want to survive, follow us

09:35.492 --> 09:40.122
All the lights are out
Come into the darkness!

09:40.205 --> 09:41.665
Yeah

09:41.748 --> 09:44.626
We could all die tonight
Or maybe we'll live

09:45.252 --> 09:48.672
We should all run and hide
Or maybe we just stay in

09:48.755 --> 09:51.300
Deeper into the void
We still can't see

09:51.717 --> 09:54.928
Society is breaking down
What will we eat?

09:55.012 --> 09:56.930
Carl?
Maybe we'll eat Carl

09:57.014 --> 09:58.640
-Wait, what?
-I said maybe

09:58.724 --> 10:00.809
-Dude.
-Definitely eating Carl

10:00.893 --> 10:04.646
No schools, no banks
Nowhere to charge your phone

10:04.730 --> 10:08.108
No movies, no gas
Okay, maybe there's gas

10:08.192 --> 10:11.111
But there's still nowhere
To charge your phone

10:11.195 --> 10:14.698
Come into the darkness
Yeah!

10:15.282 --> 10:18.744
We could all die tonight
Or maybe we'll live

10:18.827 --> 10:22.581
We should all run and hide
Or maybe we just stay in

10:22.664 --> 10:23.874
I can't see.

10:24.917 --> 10:26.668
Looks like we're not going anywhere.

10:26.752 --> 10:28.170
We're trapped in New Jersey.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.671
Oh, crap. This is your fault.

10:29.755 --> 10:31.840
Yep. Sorry.
Must have plugged in too many things.

10:31.924 --> 10:35.052
At least I have the infrastructure plans,
so it doesn't really matter where I am.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.804
I'm just always that hot lady
who's gonna make so much money.

10:37.888 --> 10:40.641
Oh, my sweet, sweet plans.
No one can have you but me.

10:41.850 --> 10:43.602
What are you all looking at?

10:43.685 --> 10:45.354
I think we should go.

10:45.437 --> 10:49.274
Why?
Stay here where it's safe. In the dark.

10:49.358 --> 10:51.527
There's nothing to be afraid of
just because there are no rules

10:51.610 --> 10:52.611
in a tri-state blackout.

10:52.694 --> 10:55.280
You know, during the blackout of '77,
I did some terrible things.

10:55.364 --> 10:58.075
I pooped in a garbage can. No one cared.
And you know what else?

10:58.158 --> 10:59.326
I liked it. It felt right.

10:59.409 --> 11:00.827
Very interesting, Portergrave.

11:00.911 --> 11:03.956
I hope you find somewhere interesting to
poop this time. But if you'll excuse us--

11:04.039 --> 11:06.291
You were a fool
to bring those plans with you, Bitsy.

11:06.375 --> 11:09.127
I didn't. I brought fakes.
I'm not an idiot.

11:09.211 --> 11:10.379
-You're lying.
-I'm not.

11:10.462 --> 11:12.422
I'll prove it to you.
I'm going to tear them up right now.

11:12.506 --> 11:14.216
-You're not doing it.
-Well, not right now.

11:14.299 --> 11:16.510
I was gonna save it as a treat
for when I get home.

11:16.593 --> 11:18.262
Let's get out of here.
Where the hell's Jarvis?

11:18.345 --> 11:19.930
Don't know.
Probably stuck in all this traffic.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.056
Give!

11:21.139 --> 11:23.725
How come you get to mug Bitsy?
I wanna mug Bitsy.

11:24.309 --> 11:25.686
Helen, get us out of here.

11:25.769 --> 11:27.145
How? I don't have a car.

11:27.229 --> 11:30.607
Carry me. Put those long,
stringy arms to use for once.

11:30.691 --> 11:31.775
Up you go.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.193
Bitsy, don't go.

11:33.277 --> 11:36.780
Come out and play.

11:37.531 --> 11:41.201
So, without their beloved
Gina Tracker, FBI, the family is--

11:42.035 --> 11:45.080
Damn it. Not you too.
Oh, good. Eight bats!

11:45.163 --> 11:47.624
I just want you to know
the power's out in the park.

11:47.708 --> 11:50.002
Yeah. I know it's out in the park.
It's out everywhere.

11:50.085 --> 11:52.379
I changed all the lightbulbs.
Still nothing.

11:52.462 --> 11:53.964
Yeah, it's a blackout, Elwood.

11:54.047 --> 11:55.841
Well, then I'm just gonna
microwave some food

11:55.924 --> 11:56.925
and hang out in the office.

11:57.009 --> 11:58.594
-No. Elwood--
-Strike that, boss.

11:58.677 --> 12:01.180
The microwave doesn't work.
What a night. What are the odds?

12:01.263 --> 12:02.472
All right, call me if you need me.

12:02.556 --> 12:05.017
Maybe I'll kill some time,
watch Gina Tracker, FBI.

12:05.100 --> 12:05.934
Bye, Elwood.

12:06.018 --> 12:07.728
You want me to bring this microwave
to the dumpster?

12:07.811 --> 12:08.645
No, don't do that.

12:08.729 --> 12:10.731
I'm throwing away this computer too.
Totally dead.

12:10.814 --> 12:12.691
-No, don't do that.
-They're all dead, boss.

12:12.774 --> 12:14.818
I'll check in with you later.
Don't throw anything away!

12:16.612 --> 12:17.821
If they get us,

12:17.905 --> 12:21.241
I think you should be prepared to
sacrifice your body like we agreed upon.

12:21.325 --> 12:22.868
-Never agreed to that.
-Unspoken agreement.

12:22.951 --> 12:27.581
Bitsy, where are you?

12:27.664 --> 12:29.291
They're close. We should hide.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.877
Hide? We're in the middle of the street.
Where can we hide?

12:31.960 --> 12:34.838
All I want are the city plans,
and I'll let you go. I promise.

12:34.922 --> 12:36.840
You can trust me.
What, these fondue forks?

12:36.924 --> 12:39.009
Just something I use
to find my way through the city.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.260
They're my feeling forks.

12:46.558 --> 12:47.643
This whole place stinks.

12:47.726 --> 12:49.937
-I mean, we're in a dumpster.
-You're in a dumpster.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.438
Come on.

12:53.941 --> 12:56.985
Hey, I know we're all disappointed
about Gina Tracker, FBI,

12:57.069 --> 12:58.779
but I have an idea
for how to make this fun.

12:58.862 --> 13:00.739
Let's play a game.
And I've got just the thing.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.407
I picked it up at the thrift store
for a rainy day.

13:02.491 --> 13:03.909
This is more like an inky blackness.

13:03.992 --> 13:06.078
Still works. Salem Witch Hunt!

13:06.161 --> 13:08.163
-That's creepy, Mom.
-Life is creepy, honey.

13:08.247 --> 13:09.289
And cozy. Creepy cozy.

13:09.373 --> 13:11.291
How do you play? Are there rules?
I wanna hear the rules.

13:11.375 --> 13:13.627
-Let's go through the rules.
-Someone loves rules.

13:13.710 --> 13:16.964
"In the quaint village of Prudence,
Massachusetts, evil is afoot.

13:17.047 --> 13:19.466
While most of the townsfolk
are god-fearing Puritans,

13:19.550 --> 13:20.968
one among you is a witch.

13:21.051 --> 13:24.555
The Puritans win if they can identify
the witch and put her to the torch,

13:24.638 --> 13:27.474
and the witch wins
if she can achieve her darker purpose."

13:27.558 --> 13:29.309
See, I told you this was gonna be fun.

13:29.393 --> 13:32.646
Kind of making light of
a horrible period in American history.

13:32.729 --> 13:35.732
True, true, but in a way
that's appropriate for ages seven and up.

13:35.816 --> 13:38.735
Yeah, Dad. Way to kill the fun.
Let's burn some crones.

13:38.819 --> 13:39.987
Best family ever!

13:40.070 --> 13:41.154
I think we lost 'em.

13:41.238 --> 13:44.199
I can't believe you grew up here.
Did you lose a bet or something?

13:44.283 --> 13:46.034
It's really not that bad. It's just dark.

13:46.118 --> 13:48.412
We have to get back to the Brandenham.
And I know how.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.788
The docks. We'll charter a ferry.

13:49.872 --> 13:53.000
Everyone knows that in times of trouble,
the rich can always take to the water.

13:53.083 --> 13:55.127
Nothing bad has ever happened
to a rich person on the water.

13:55.210 --> 13:56.295
The Titanic?

13:56.378 --> 13:57.921
All right, history nerd. One time.

13:58.005 --> 13:59.298
-Natalie Wood.
-Oh, enough.

13:59.381 --> 14:02.259
You know, there was a shortcut
we used to take to the river.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.136
We just have to jump a fence.
Might be quicker.

14:04.219 --> 14:06.680
Save it for your podcast
about boring things.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.724
The sign says waterfront this way.
Let's go.

14:08.807 --> 14:11.059
Look, there's the water. See?
It's right there.

14:11.143 --> 14:13.020
What, are you calling that sign a liar?

14:13.103 --> 14:14.855
We're listening to the sign.

14:16.148 --> 14:18.609
Okay. The Persona cards
have been distributed.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.068
That will tell you your character.

14:20.152 --> 14:22.070
Now I distribute the Alignment cards.

14:22.154 --> 14:25.115
Three of us will be pure Puritans,
one of us is the wicked witch.

14:25.199 --> 14:26.950
Everyone glance at your cards.

14:29.161 --> 14:30.495
Now we begin. Owen goes first.

14:30.579 --> 14:33.457
If I'm understanding the rules right,
I draw one Chastity card

14:33.540 --> 14:35.918
and one Righteousness card,
which I can then play

14:36.001 --> 14:38.462
to ask a yes-or-no question,
so I'll do that.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.339
My question is: Paige, are you the witch?

14:40.422 --> 14:42.841
Really getting to the heart of it?
No, I'm not the witch.

14:42.925 --> 14:43.926
But you could be lying.

14:44.009 --> 14:45.844
Exactly. I could be a witchy woman,
and you wouldn't know.

14:45.928 --> 14:46.970
But you'd tell me if you were.

14:47.054 --> 14:49.389
No, Owen, I wouldn't.
Because the point of the game,

14:49.473 --> 14:53.018
if you're the witch, is to lie your way
to victory to achieve your darker purpose.

14:53.101 --> 14:54.186
I like saying that. It sounds cool.

14:54.269 --> 14:56.063
-So, are you the witch?
-I am not the witch.

14:56.146 --> 14:57.731
Okay, Cole, your turn. This is fun, right?

14:57.814 --> 15:01.318
I like it. Okay, my name is Putnam Virtue,
gentleman farmer.

15:01.401 --> 15:04.571
I draw a few cards, and my question is:
Mom, are you the witch?

15:04.655 --> 15:06.323
What? He just asked me that. No.

15:06.406 --> 15:07.574
I think she might be the witch.

15:07.658 --> 15:10.244
Mom, have you been cavorting
with a black goat in the woods?

15:10.327 --> 15:11.620
An evil black goat?

15:11.703 --> 15:13.247
No, and you haven't drawn a question card.

15:13.330 --> 15:17.167
My name is Goody Ruth Piousbottom,
and I make fine quilts and weavings.

15:17.251 --> 15:18.293
How come you all think I'm the witch?

15:18.377 --> 15:19.378
-Well...
-It's just--

15:19.461 --> 15:21.713
-What?
-You lie the easiest out of all of us.

15:21.797 --> 15:22.881
Excuse me?

15:22.965 --> 15:25.634
Don't get mad. Not in a bad way.
Just, you know, little white lies.

15:25.717 --> 15:27.511
Name literally one time I've ever lied.

15:28.303 --> 15:30.305
We'd love to come to your
destination wedding,

15:30.389 --> 15:34.643
but the kids don't have winter break
this year. I know! I know!

15:34.726 --> 15:36.353
I think it looks great on you, honey.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.772
First we got married, and then we had you.

15:38.856 --> 15:41.358
Well, I didn't know
you all think I'm a pants-on-fire liar.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.819
We don't think you're a liar.
We just think you're a witch.

15:43.902 --> 15:45.654
-Because you're a liar.
-So what's happening?

15:45.737 --> 15:48.031
Are all three of you
making a formal accusation against me?

15:48.115 --> 15:50.075
If you're wrong, according to the rules,
you lose.

15:50.158 --> 15:52.411
I mean,
it seems like the logical thing to do.

15:52.494 --> 15:54.788
Okay, but before you do, may I point out

15:54.872 --> 15:57.958
that Cole's eye has been twitching
nonstop since we started this game.

15:58.041 --> 16:00.878
So what? I'm tired.
I only got ten hours last night.

16:00.961 --> 16:01.962
That's a tell.

16:02.045 --> 16:05.048
You were awfully quick to turn on Mom,
twitchy the witchy.

16:05.132 --> 16:07.467
Lies! The only witch I wanna be
is Stevie Nicks.

16:07.551 --> 16:09.553
Okay,
maybe we should all try calming down.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.597
What happened to
cozy family blackout night?

16:11.680 --> 16:14.183
Sounds like something a witch might say
to deflect suspicion.

16:14.266 --> 16:16.101
-I'm not the witch.
-I'm freaking out.

16:16.185 --> 16:17.728
The lies will drown this family.

16:17.811 --> 16:21.315
No! We're the best family ever, remember?
And we're having fun. Say it!

16:21.940 --> 16:23.275
-We're having fun.
-Good.

16:23.859 --> 16:27.321
There it is. Ferry-land.
We're gonna make a deal with the captain.

16:27.404 --> 16:29.239
You mean buy a ticket to get on the ferry?

16:29.323 --> 16:30.824
You sound so poor when you say that.

16:32.242 --> 16:35.078
Here we are, down on the docks.
How about a forklift?

16:35.162 --> 16:37.372
-Portergrave!
-I'm one step ahead of you, Bitsy.

16:37.456 --> 16:39.124
-Fork it over.
-Too much with the fork stuff.

16:39.208 --> 16:40.209
I knew you'd be here.

16:40.292 --> 16:42.878
Mother always told me if there's trouble,
head for the water.

16:42.961 --> 16:44.588
Also never wear denim after 6:00 p.m.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.632
Back off! Those plans are mine.

16:46.715 --> 16:48.050
Not if I get them first!

16:48.133 --> 16:51.845
Helen, block them!
Good luck getting around this.

16:51.929 --> 16:53.722
My beautiful ankle. Helen, help!

16:53.805 --> 16:55.557
I could've done so many other things
with my life.

16:55.641 --> 16:56.934
-Grab the briefcase.
-All right.

16:57.017 --> 16:58.560
Left! No, right!

16:58.644 --> 17:00.812
-Stop pulling my hair.
-It's a good system.

17:00.896 --> 17:04.066
Don't worry, Bitsy. After I buy
the Brandenham, I'll knock it down.

17:04.148 --> 17:07.194
Turn it into an improv comedy school
or whatever those dumb kids like.

17:07.277 --> 17:10.614
No! I'm pulling but it's not working.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.031
Yeah, I'm taking over.

17:12.115 --> 17:13.742
No!

17:13.825 --> 17:15.993
No! Where'd she go? I can't see.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.829
Yeah, it's a blackout, you idiot.

17:17.913 --> 17:20.999
Well, let's get down there.
Search the waters. Find her!

17:25.546 --> 17:29.091
Well, you're welcome. For saving your life
in a pretty cool way actually.

17:29.174 --> 17:31.969
Holding onto the edge of the railing,
then swinging us into here.

17:32.052 --> 17:34.179
What do you want, a medal?
What is this place?

17:34.263 --> 17:36.348
We used to jump down here
when I was a kid.

17:36.431 --> 17:38.642
Glad the foam finger factory
is still in business.

17:38.725 --> 17:41.603
Still number one. We don't have much time
before they find us. Can you walk?

17:41.687 --> 17:44.523
I think so.
That's normal. Happens every time.

17:44.606 --> 17:46.191
-Oh, I know.
-But that's bad.

17:46.275 --> 17:48.360
Okay, climb on.
I know a way back to Manhattan.

17:48.443 --> 17:50.863
There's a utility walkway
next to the Lincoln Tunnel,

17:50.946 --> 17:53.282
or at least there used to be.
Was an old dock worker shortcut.

17:53.365 --> 17:55.200
-How do you know about it?
-My mother was a dock worker.

17:55.284 --> 17:57.077
-I get it. You're poor.
-You wanna get home?

17:57.160 --> 17:59.162
No, I want to hear more about your past.

17:59.830 --> 18:02.499
Please, dear God,
let the damn tunnel be open.

18:16.138 --> 18:17.764
We don't have to finish playing this game.

18:17.848 --> 18:18.849
Yes, we do.

18:18.932 --> 18:20.893
And that sounds like something
the witch might say

18:20.976 --> 18:23.228
-if she was afraid we were on to her.
-I'm not the witch!

18:23.312 --> 18:25.439
I wish we could've just watched
Gina Tracker, FBI.

18:25.522 --> 18:27.691
Maybe we should stop.
Can we move to a place with TV?

18:27.774 --> 18:28.609
-Interesting.
-What?

18:28.692 --> 18:31.445
I hadn't seen it before,
but now it's so obvious. You're the witch.

18:31.528 --> 18:32.946
-I'm not the witch.
-Oh, no?

18:33.030 --> 18:35.365
Consider how easily you lied
to Mother and Father this evening.

18:35.449 --> 18:37.409
-I didn't lie.
-Didn't you, Sister?

18:37.492 --> 18:40.329
-About Brendan and the concert?
-Wait, what were you lying about?

18:40.412 --> 18:41.455
Molly neglected to tell you

18:41.538 --> 18:43.415
that it's not just her and Brendan
going to the concert.

18:43.498 --> 18:45.167
They're going with Clarissa and Ronnie.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.836
Clarissa and Ronnie who got caught
with tequila at the dance?

18:47.920 --> 18:50.005
-That Clarissa and Ronnie?
-That Clarissa and Ronnie.

18:50.088 --> 18:52.132
-You rat.
-Is that true, Molly?

18:52.216 --> 18:53.842
Is this a double date with criminals?

18:53.926 --> 18:55.469
Okay, it's a double date, and yes,

18:55.552 --> 18:57.804
Clarissa and Ronnie made some bad choices
at the dance,

18:57.888 --> 18:59.431
but that's not what Brendan and I
are gonna do.

18:59.515 --> 19:01.850
Brendan doesn't even like tequila.
He's a scotch man.

19:02.434 --> 19:03.769
I'm kidding. I'm kidding!

19:03.852 --> 19:05.479
We're not cool with Cla-Ronnie.

19:05.562 --> 19:07.356
They were just the ones
with the tickets to the show.

19:07.439 --> 19:09.358
-You should've told us.
-We wanna trust you.

19:09.441 --> 19:11.777
I told you. Classic witch behavior.

19:11.860 --> 19:13.487
-You're right.
-Yeah, good point.

19:13.570 --> 19:15.113
I'm not the witch!

19:15.197 --> 19:17.324
-I'm not!
-We'll see about that.

19:17.407 --> 19:21.495
Gimme, gimme, gimme
Reasons it's not you

19:21.578 --> 19:25.624
Who among us went
And chose the witch way?

19:25.707 --> 19:29.294
Tell me, tell me, tell me
What you say is true

19:29.378 --> 19:32.798
We gotta point the finger soon
But which way?

19:32.881 --> 19:34.967
I just wanted to see a show

19:35.050 --> 19:37.094
You lied and tried to
Get something by us

19:37.177 --> 19:38.846
I was gonna tell you though

19:38.929 --> 19:40.973
Instead your actions were impious

19:41.056 --> 19:42.891
See, all of them now at odds

19:42.975 --> 19:45.519
Our Puritans must do
What they must doth

19:45.602 --> 19:47.062
What was that? Oh, my God

19:47.145 --> 19:49.106
Bat, moth, bat, moth
Bat, moth, bat, moth

19:49.731 --> 19:53.527
Here comes Porty
As he swings his forksies wide

19:53.610 --> 19:57.406
Gotta poke her, smoke her out
But tell me which way?

19:57.489 --> 20:01.493
I'm a demon hotelier
So, Bitsy, run and hide

20:01.577 --> 20:04.746
Look behind ya, gonna find ya
But which way?

20:04.830 --> 20:06.790
Head to the tunnel outta Jersey

20:06.874 --> 20:09.334
Or you're dead
Better do it in a hurry, scurry!

20:09.418 --> 20:10.836
I know I'm lookin' older

20:10.919 --> 20:13.255
'Cause of time
And this lady on my shoulder, hold her

20:13.338 --> 20:17.009
And there's no light in any sight
To show 'em which way

20:17.092 --> 20:20.846
But I'm in luck where I grew up
So I know which way

20:20.929 --> 20:24.057
Give it up
Give it up for New Jersey

20:24.141 --> 20:27.519
Jersey
New Jersey

20:27.603 --> 20:31.690
Gather ye, gather ye
Neath the full-grown moon

20:31.773 --> 20:35.527
Get ye naked 'cause, baby
That's the witch way

20:35.611 --> 20:39.656
Moon the moon
Underneath the full-grown moon

20:39.740 --> 20:43.118
Time to dote on a goat
It's the witch way

20:43.202 --> 20:50.000
Microwave, you had such a good life

20:50.501 --> 20:57.299
Oh, microwave, can I call you Mike?

20:57.841 --> 21:00.928
You seem like a Mike to me

21:01.011 --> 21:05.849
I'm sad to see you go

21:05.933 --> 21:09.853
I hope you got to say goodbye

21:09.937 --> 21:14.608
To all of your friends

21:15.192 --> 21:18.904
Wow, this night got dark so fast

21:19.530 --> 21:23.534
In the blackout, watch your back
And find a way back out

21:23.617 --> 21:27.538
Intuition shows you
Which one and which way

21:27.621 --> 21:31.542
Take a right, go toward the light
The end is now in sight

21:31.625 --> 21:35.003
Bet Gina Tracker, FBI
Would know which way

21:35.087 --> 21:39.091
Gina Tracker
Wanna watch Gina Tracker

21:39.174 --> 21:43.053
Point me which way

21:43.136 --> 21:47.683
Which way to the light

21:47.766 --> 21:49.393
Make amends
The tunnel ends

21:49.476 --> 21:53.272
And you will find your light

21:53.355 --> 21:55.941
Oh, thank God, we're back.
Helen, kiss the ground.

21:56.024 --> 21:57.150
-No.
-High-five it then.

21:57.234 --> 21:59.695
We're nowhere closer
to figuring out who the witch is,

21:59.778 --> 22:02.573
but I feel like we can all agree
that I can still go to the concert, right?

22:02.656 --> 22:04.533
-You didn't tell us the whole truth.
-So, no.

22:04.616 --> 22:06.368
This family isn't the best family.

22:06.451 --> 22:09.079
It's just okay most of the time.
But not right now.

22:09.162 --> 22:10.414
Sew that on a pillow.

22:10.497 --> 22:13.792
There she is,
the most beautiful penis in New York.

22:13.876 --> 22:16.879
I-- I told you I'd get us home.

22:16.962 --> 22:19.006
Boy, are you out of shape. Embarrassing.

22:20.924 --> 22:22.384
-Sneak attack.
-Oh, crap.

22:22.467 --> 22:23.802
I followed you. Isn't this fun?

22:23.886 --> 22:25.304
You're too late, Portergrave.

22:25.387 --> 22:28.599
Go back to Brooklyn and have a craft beer
with a professional clown,

22:28.682 --> 22:30.309
or whatever it is
you people do over there.

22:30.392 --> 22:31.935
I think you're forgetting one thing.

22:32.019 --> 22:33.812
Give me the plans
or I'll use these on her.

22:33.896 --> 22:36.857
What's it gonna be, Bitsy?
The plans or your best friend gets it.

22:36.940 --> 22:38.775
Don't make me fondue it.

22:38.859 --> 22:40.152
Best friend?

22:40.235 --> 22:42.029
That's a good one. Best friend.
You know what?

22:42.112 --> 22:43.906
Just go ahead and fork me.
Let's get this over with.

22:43.989 --> 22:45.407
Wait! Don't do it.

22:45.490 --> 22:47.117
-Really?
-I'm coming out.

22:47.201 --> 22:48.827
Just take it, Fartergrave.

22:48.911 --> 22:50.412
Ha! I'm the king of the night.

22:50.954 --> 22:52.664
Bitsy, you didn't have to do that.

22:52.748 --> 22:55.834
I've been stabbed with forks before.
It's not that bad. By you, actually.

22:55.918 --> 22:58.754
Don't worry. I still have the plans.
The old switcheroo.

22:58.837 --> 23:00.923
Oh, good for you.
You didn't do a nice thing.

23:01.006 --> 23:03.967
Let's go. I need to take a bath
and wash the Weehawken off of me.

23:04.051 --> 23:05.636
Don't you want to know
what was in the briefcase?

23:05.719 --> 23:07.846
-No.
-I pooped in it. No rules in a blackout.

23:07.930 --> 23:10.641
-And it felt good. Portergrave was right.
-When did you do that?

23:10.724 --> 23:12.392
What? Do you want me to
take you through my process?

23:12.476 --> 23:14.353
Just don't mess with Bitsy Brandenham.

23:18.607 --> 23:20.442
Oh, no. What have I done?

23:21.151 --> 23:22.152
Oh, thank goodness.

23:22.236 --> 23:24.530
-Can we be done playing this?
-Definitely. We're never playing it again.

23:24.613 --> 23:26.740
-But I wanna know who was the witch.
-I kinda wanna know too.

23:26.823 --> 23:28.951
I want you all to know I was
telling the truth about this game,

23:29.034 --> 23:30.869
and that you're all bad people
for not believing me.

23:30.953 --> 23:33.372
Oh, no, no. I say shuffle your cards
back into the deck,

23:33.455 --> 23:36.917
and then we'll never have to find out who
in our family is a filthy, filthy liar.

23:37.000 --> 23:38.710
I know you're right, but I have to know.

23:38.794 --> 23:40.420
Everyone, turn your Alignment cards
over on three.

23:40.504 --> 23:42.840
-One, two, three.
-No, no, no! Fine.

23:45.133 --> 23:47.678
Wait, so none of us was the witch?
I don't understand.

23:47.761 --> 23:49.179
I don't either.

23:49.805 --> 23:51.306
I understand.

23:52.182 --> 23:53.308
The witch card.

23:53.392 --> 23:56.562
It must have fallen out of the deck,
and we didn't see it 'cause it was dark.

23:56.645 --> 23:58.397
-'Cause of the blackout.
-I told you it wasn't me.

23:58.480 --> 24:01.358
-I told you it wasn't me.
-I told all of you witches it wasn't me.

24:01.441 --> 24:04.278
I told you too. Though not as loudly
or aggressively as the rest of you.

24:04.361 --> 24:06.572
Great. Well, fun family-bonding night.
Let's never do it again.

24:06.655 --> 24:08.615
Molly, wait. I'm sorry I ratted you out.

24:08.699 --> 24:11.159
It was just the heat of the moment.
I thought you were a witch.

24:12.077 --> 24:14.830
I'm sorry too.
That you ratted on me. No, it's okay.

24:14.913 --> 24:16.540
I should've told you guys
about the double date.

24:16.623 --> 24:18.250
I just didn't wanna give you
a reason to say no.

24:18.333 --> 24:19.751
She can go, right, Paige?

24:19.835 --> 24:22.838
It's not like she's responsible
for those felons Clarissa and Ronnie.

24:22.921 --> 24:25.549
But if they show up
with so much as an expired apple juice,

24:25.632 --> 24:26.967
I will burn them at the stake.

24:27.050 --> 24:30.679
Now a very special encore
presentation of Gina Tracker, FBI.

24:30.762 --> 24:32.139
Gina Tracker, FBI!

24:32.222 --> 24:33.390
Best family night ever.

24:33.473 --> 24:34.933
I mean, it definitely wasn't.

24:35.017 --> 24:36.393
Gina Tracker is gonna
make everything better.

24:36.476 --> 24:38.061
-She always does.
-I hate her new haircut.

24:38.145 --> 24:40.147
-Should we turn it off?
-No, it's fine. It'll grow out.

24:40.230 --> 24:45.986
In the dark, nobody knows your name

24:46.069 --> 24:51.450
In the dark, everything is fair game

24:51.533 --> 24:56.955
In the dark, nobody knows your face

24:57.039 --> 25:02.711
In the dark
You're in a state of grace

25:03.212 --> 25:08.258
Can't tell if you're a lad or a lass
Ain't no working, middle or upper class

25:08.342 --> 25:11.136
At last, pass gas with impunity

25:11.220 --> 25:14.223
Grant that ass immunity

25:14.306 --> 25:18.685
In the dark, nobody knows your name

25:18.769 --> 25:24.441
'Cause in the dark
You're in a state of grace
