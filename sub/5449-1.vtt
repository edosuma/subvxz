00:52.333 --> 00:55.832
WARSAW, 1999

01:05.458 --> 01:07.124
Lucky son of a bitch.

01:07.833 --> 01:09.207
Your size.

01:10.375 --> 01:12.165
Nice kicks.

01:14.416 --> 01:16.415
You're fucking crazy? Not now.

01:16.500 --> 01:18.374
- Yeah, now.
- Faster, man.

01:18.458 --> 01:19.749
Relax.

01:19.833 --> 01:21.915
We're fucked. Run!

01:24.958 --> 01:26.790
Freeze!

01:26.875 --> 01:28.624
Move your ass!

02:05.791 --> 02:07.332
Let go!

02:08.000 --> 02:09.624
He knocked my tooth out!

02:09.708 --> 02:11.707
Who in Poland has all the teeth?

02:17.000 --> 02:19.957
- Good morning, Mrs Woźniak.
- Morning.

02:32.625 --> 02:34.540
Turn that off.

02:37.750 --> 02:40.249
Chill, mum.
I wrote something for you.

02:40.750 --> 02:42.374
So you'd relax a little.

02:47.125 --> 02:49.624
Look in mother's eyes,
she's suffered a lot

02:49.708 --> 02:51.749
Many tears
she cried for her son

02:51.833 --> 02:53.874
Did and would do anything

02:53.958 --> 02:56.082
She cried so many times,
it happens often

02:56.166 --> 02:58.332
So make sure, kiddo
you put your name

02:58.416 --> 03:00.999
In the right style.
Everyone's after money

03:01.083 --> 03:02.790
Don't say I'm lost

03:02.875 --> 03:04.540
What's with these shoes?

03:07.875 --> 03:12.124
You've got money for new shoes,
but not to share living expenses?

03:14.708 --> 03:16.999
I've said it a thousand times.

03:17.083 --> 03:19.207
At home you wear slippers!

03:23.041 --> 03:24.957
I've got something for the home.

03:25.791 --> 03:28.124
- Enjoy.
- Look me in the eye.

03:34.291 --> 03:36.290
You look away, you lose.

03:50.208 --> 03:51.290
Yo.

03:51.375 --> 03:54.374
Neighbours are having an ongoing party?

03:54.458 --> 03:56.999
They're fucking poverted.

03:57.541 --> 03:59.915
Or perverted. Whatever.

04:07.916 --> 04:11.082
- Łysa?
- Show lady some respect.

04:11.500 --> 04:14.124
- Go get some cigs.
- On my way.

04:14.791 --> 04:16.457
Long time, no see.

04:17.458 --> 04:18.874
Hi.

04:18.958 --> 04:21.499
I heard about your hurdle race.

04:23.041 --> 04:24.999
You are quite a sportsman.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.374
Good you didn't break your legs.

04:30.458 --> 04:33.457
Sorry, Łysa, there's no shop nearby.

04:33.541 --> 04:35.165
Seriously?

04:35.250 --> 04:37.457
- Maybe we go further...
- Sure thing.

04:37.541 --> 04:39.207
Get in.

04:45.416 --> 04:47.082
Who's that chick?

04:47.166 --> 04:48.624
Łysa.

04:49.458 --> 04:50.999
- That Łysa?
- Yup.

04:51.083 --> 04:53.790
She has friends in Ząbki.
Worked with Granpa.

04:54.416 --> 04:57.749
- Are you fucking me?!
- You would feel it in your ass.

04:57.833 --> 05:00.499
She's hot.
Wonder how many she banged.

05:01.166 --> 05:02.790
A lot.
Likes younger dudes.

05:02.875 --> 05:05.415
Then I should get interested. C'mon.

05:05.500 --> 05:06.957
Let's get high.

05:07.041 --> 05:09.499
Chada is not jealous,
stays in your psyche

05:09.583 --> 05:11.707
Doing your thing
You're limitless

05:11.791 --> 05:14.374
Welcome to Poland,
where they kill for cash

05:14.458 --> 05:16.915
Stab you in the back
when giving you a cake

05:17.000 --> 05:19.207
And pouring you a drink. Yo, man!

05:19.875 --> 05:21.290
Hi, sis.

05:21.583 --> 05:23.040
Yo, Pablo.

05:24.125 --> 05:25.999
Why so fucking slow?

05:26.083 --> 05:27.790
I'm fucking tired.

05:28.291 --> 05:30.790
I start my shifts at 7 am,
even on Sundays.

05:31.916 --> 05:33.665
What's up with your tooth?

05:34.083 --> 05:37.165
Give me a break.
Lost it at work.

05:37.833 --> 05:39.374
I'm broke.

05:42.625 --> 05:44.249
What's the job?

05:44.333 --> 05:46.582
I pack plates into boxes.

05:47.291 --> 05:49.749
- How much do they pay?
- 4,20.

05:51.583 --> 05:53.915
- For one plate?
- Per hour.

05:54.000 --> 05:55.749
You're shitting me!

05:57.166 --> 05:59.582
- And?
- They didn't pay anyone yet.

05:59.958 --> 06:02.374
- The whole staff is waiting.
- And?

06:02.916 --> 06:05.290
I can't go fucking public.

06:05.375 --> 06:08.332
I'll steal some plates
and sell them tomorrow.

06:08.416 --> 06:11.040
And get the fuck out of this country.

06:11.125 --> 06:13.749
- Where to?
- Germany.

06:13.833 --> 06:16.082
You can go with me.

06:18.000 --> 06:21.124
Sounds like communist meddling.

06:21.625 --> 06:25.040
Expectations, salary on time,
what fucking else?

06:26.708 --> 06:28.540
The system has fucking changed.

06:30.500 --> 06:32.040
It's capitalism.

06:32.958 --> 06:35.415
Time to act on your own.

06:35.500 --> 06:38.082
Time for young and resourceful ones.

06:38.458 --> 06:42.124
All that matters are drugs,
not canned meat.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.707
Fuck it, I'm good here.

06:46.125 --> 06:48.624
Then why you're going
around toothless?

06:52.916 --> 06:55.290
And you, Chada?
What's you're up to?

07:01.666 --> 07:03.415
What's up?

07:03.500 --> 07:05.332
Got something good?

07:05.416 --> 07:07.832
I always have top notch stuff.
For twenty.

07:07.916 --> 07:09.374
Put in on my tab.

07:09.458 --> 07:10.832
Fine.

07:10.916 --> 07:12.415
But pay me back!

07:12.500 --> 07:15.374
- I'll have some coke next week.
- Not my thing.

07:27.583 --> 07:29.249
Yo, man!

07:31.375 --> 07:34.165
There's one thing
you give and take

07:34.250 --> 07:36.665
It's not about money,
it's about respect

07:36.750 --> 07:38.957
There's one thing
you give and take

07:39.041 --> 07:41.624
It's not about money,
it's about respect

07:41.708 --> 07:44.124
There's one thing
you give and take

07:44.208 --> 07:46.749
It's not about money,
it's about respect

07:46.833 --> 07:49.249
There's one thing
you give and take

07:49.333 --> 07:51.874
It's not about money,
it's about respect

07:51.958 --> 07:54.374
Lout will be lout,
forever and ever, Amen

07:54.458 --> 07:56.749
Stay with your bros
and you'll be safe

07:56.833 --> 07:59.207
Making hip hop is our mission

07:59.291 --> 08:01.915
Help your mate,
so he won't hit the bottom

08:02.000 --> 08:04.457
Let him know that
you're more than a beggar

08:04.541 --> 08:06.790
What counts is respect

08:06.875 --> 08:09.457
You don't follow?
Then you'll get slated

08:09.541 --> 08:11.665
You were raised for nothing

08:11.750 --> 08:14.124
Begging and crying won't help

08:14.208 --> 08:16.999
Begging and crying won't help

08:17.083 --> 08:19.499
I trust my judgment
even when I'm wasted

08:19.583 --> 08:21.874
I know who's loyal
and who's a scum

08:21.958 --> 08:24.457
I know respect
and it won't change

08:24.541 --> 08:26.999
I rhyme for my bros,
that's what I love

08:27.083 --> 08:29.540
Got nothing more to say,
Klima - respect!

08:32.500 --> 08:34.289
That was good.

08:35.750 --> 08:37.957
Come by tomorrow at 11 am.

08:38.416 --> 08:39.832
We'll talk.

08:40.750 --> 08:42.164
Be there.

08:42.582 --> 08:44.164
OK?

08:54.958 --> 08:56.707
Man!

08:56.791 --> 08:59.249
That's the guy from the TV.

08:59.333 --> 09:01.457
He hosts some show.

09:01.833 --> 09:04.707
You feel that? Nice one!

09:40.000 --> 09:41.332
Yo.

09:47.291 --> 09:49.540
Black sun rising over us

09:50.000 --> 09:52.415
Over roofs,
over our family rules

09:52.500 --> 09:54.165
I...

09:54.250 --> 09:56.499
- It's ok?
- Very nice.

09:56.583 --> 09:58.374
You got something more?

09:58.666 --> 10:00.999
Anything else on the table?

10:04.666 --> 10:06.957
Lowlife knows no lie,
only the truth

10:07.041 --> 10:09.540
- Cause one man's lies...
- Enough!

10:09.625 --> 10:11.957
Sit down and listen.

10:12.041 --> 10:14.915
It needs some work.
Some smoothing up.

10:15.666 --> 10:17.499
Too much swearing.

10:18.750 --> 10:20.457
Here's the plan.
You'll rap.

10:20.541 --> 10:23.290
I'll take care of songs.

10:23.375 --> 10:26.207
You'll get a songwriter.
Make some numbers

10:26.291 --> 10:29.249
on women and summer holidays.

10:29.333 --> 10:32.832
And in a month

10:33.041 --> 10:34.957
you'll appear in "Blaise's Bike".

10:35.041 --> 10:37.207
Sounds good?
Now listen.

10:37.333 --> 10:39.040
Something like that.

10:39.333 --> 10:41.415
That's how I see it.

10:52.125 --> 10:55.290
We gotta do something
about your vocals.

10:56.708 --> 10:59.707
You'll take a couple
of singing classes

10:59.791 --> 11:01.582
and we're golden, right?

11:04.041 --> 11:05.499
Come on.

11:06.458 --> 11:07.915
Wanna try?

11:09.541 --> 11:11.290
- Yes?
- Thanks.

11:12.208 --> 11:13.665
As you wish.

11:38.125 --> 11:39.707
There's a deal.

11:40.375 --> 11:42.499
They brought new goods to Olszynka.

11:43.416 --> 11:45.374
Razors, irons.

11:46.958 --> 11:48.749
Irons sell well.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.457
They always fucking do.

11:50.916 --> 11:55.040
Because every fucking businessman

11:55.250 --> 11:58.457
wants his shirt ironed.
Am I right?

11:58.541 --> 12:00.165
Last time wasn't enough?

12:00.250 --> 12:03.499
- It will be different this time.
- Just drive!

12:05.791 --> 12:07.290
I'm out.

12:07.958 --> 12:09.582
Think about it.

12:12.625 --> 12:14.790
What time do you get home?

12:14.875 --> 12:16.332
I had something to do.

12:16.416 --> 12:19.790
Look at you.
What happened?

12:19.875 --> 12:22.415
What kind of business was that?

12:22.500 --> 12:24.665
Personal.
You work night shifts too.

12:25.083 --> 12:26.874
I have to go.

12:27.333 --> 12:30.582
Be at the hospital at 3 pm.

12:30.666 --> 12:32.165
- Got it?
- Yes.

12:32.250 --> 12:34.832
- Don't be late!
- You better hurry.

12:34.916 --> 12:37.207
- Take care of this.
- Will do.

12:45.916 --> 12:48.040
Something extra for the family.

13:02.375 --> 13:04.790
Home appliances are selling well.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.665
Aren't you
forgetting something?

13:26.708 --> 13:28.457
You gotta make a living.

13:48.333 --> 13:50.332
I could use a man like you.

13:55.208 --> 13:56.999
You have something to offer?

13:59.666 --> 14:02.124
In a couple of weeks
you can own a car.

14:03.625 --> 14:05.374
Pablo's already said "yes".

14:06.666 --> 14:08.124
Pablo?

14:12.083 --> 14:13.665
I'll think about it.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.874
Think, for fuck sake.

14:17.375 --> 14:19.124
But don't overthink.

14:19.875 --> 14:22.165
Chada and overthinking?

14:27.041 --> 14:29.415
Cigs again?
You don't even smoke.

14:30.250 --> 14:32.499
I don't wanna look at you, you fuck.

14:34.708 --> 14:37.207
- It hurt?
- Good one.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.582
"It hurt?"

14:48.958 --> 14:50.582
I don't smoke.

14:57.541 --> 14:59.624
If theoretically there was a job,

14:59.708 --> 15:02.457
what theoretically would we do?

15:05.416 --> 15:07.165
Surprise me.

15:21.041 --> 15:22.749
I'm here, mum.

15:22.833 --> 15:25.457
Good. Wait.
It's crazy busy around here.

15:28.291 --> 15:30.415
Communism fell apart and what?

15:30.500 --> 15:32.082
Chicken butt.

15:32.625 --> 15:34.374
They destroyed everything.

15:34.458 --> 15:36.124
I trusted them.

15:36.583 --> 15:38.832
And I didn't?

15:40.833 --> 15:44.749
They're worse than looters in 1945.

15:44.833 --> 15:47.082
At least they didn't steal land.

15:47.166 --> 15:48.790
Where did you work?

15:48.875 --> 15:51.665
Rosa Luxemburg factory.
35 years.

15:52.125 --> 15:55.374
- Light bulbs.
- At least you got enlightened.

15:55.458 --> 15:58.249
- At least.
- Why are you late?

15:59.416 --> 16:01.165
Fucking nice shades.

16:01.250 --> 16:03.207
Watch your language.

16:03.791 --> 16:05.499
Got them from a patient.

16:07.833 --> 16:11.124
Look at you!
Couldn't you dress nicer?

16:11.666 --> 16:13.499
People are looking.

16:22.083 --> 16:24.540
Stay. Chief?

16:26.000 --> 16:27.582
Coming!

16:31.625 --> 16:33.040
That's my son.

16:33.125 --> 16:35.040
The culprit itself.

16:37.250 --> 16:40.582
If he's hard-working like you,
we'll hire him.

16:40.666 --> 16:43.790
He can start today,
we'll do paperwork tomorrow.

16:46.458 --> 16:48.874
Don't let me down.

16:49.916 --> 16:51.790
I throw you in at a deep end.

16:54.041 --> 16:55.999
I heard you're a rapper?

16:56.708 --> 16:58.540
My son listens to that music.

16:58.625 --> 17:00.082
To Vienio?

17:01.166 --> 17:03.332
No idea,
but he listens to hip hop.

17:04.083 --> 17:05.374
Come on, get change.

17:14.790 --> 17:16.540
Move out of the way!

17:17.208 --> 17:20.582
Shall I repeat or send

17:20.875 --> 17:23.582
- an official decree?
- There's a line.

17:23.875 --> 17:25.832
I don't forbid you
to stand in it.

17:25.915 --> 17:27.499
What a nation!

17:27.583 --> 17:31.665
40 years they were queueing
and can't do otherwise.

17:31.750 --> 17:35.124
Still, need someone to think for them.

17:36.750 --> 17:38.249
Boy?

17:38.625 --> 17:40.249
There's a line.

17:40.625 --> 17:42.249
Don't keep me waiting.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.749
Take this fur.

17:47.291 --> 17:50.332
I'd rather not leave this fur in here.

17:50.416 --> 17:54.207
Should I go to the restroom,
it might get stolen.

17:54.291 --> 17:57.040
So you won't go anywhere.

17:57.375 --> 17:59.665
I'll make an official complaint.

18:01.083 --> 18:03.165
Do you know who I am?

18:04.375 --> 18:06.165
Ticket, please.

18:13.333 --> 18:15.165
Next, please.

18:29.458 --> 18:30.665
Yes, Pablo?

18:31.541 --> 18:32.832
Thanks.

18:40.250 --> 18:42.457
- Remember the drill?
- Yeah.

18:52.166 --> 18:53.874
You need to stop.

18:53.958 --> 18:56.749
Your back wheel is loose.

18:57.958 --> 19:00.290
Better pull over.

19:14.958 --> 19:16.957
Right rear wheel.

19:20.125 --> 19:21.832
Shit! Stop!

19:47.500 --> 19:49.040
You're late.

19:51.375 --> 19:53.040
- I've just...
- Joking.

19:54.500 --> 19:56.040
Just joking.

19:56.958 --> 19:58.499
You're funny.

20:11.833 --> 20:13.832
When we'll get money
for the car?

20:13.916 --> 20:15.457
What car?

20:17.333 --> 20:18.874
Just joking.

20:19.541 --> 20:21.290
I'm recording and need cash.

20:21.375 --> 20:22.790
To pay for the studio.

20:25.250 --> 20:26.999
You need to wait.

20:36.166 --> 20:37.707
But I got this.

20:41.291 --> 20:42.874
What's that?

20:42.958 --> 20:44.207
Moron.

20:46.791 --> 20:48.457
Take it.

20:48.875 --> 20:51.332
You sell it, you'll get 3%.

21:00.333 --> 21:01.832
Five.

21:01.916 --> 21:03.790
Fucking lunatic.

21:04.208 --> 21:05.665
Five.

21:06.375 --> 21:07.957
You know what you're doing?

21:13.375 --> 21:14.999
Get the fuck out.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.957
See me as lost, not a stupid one

22:00.041 --> 22:02.790
I know where my problems
are coming from

22:02.875 --> 22:05.707
In the streets
I learned how to make money

22:05.791 --> 22:08.499
I counted the cash,
not school degrees

22:08.583 --> 22:11.374
Alcohol and drugs,
I rely on myself now.

22:11.458 --> 22:14.165
Only I can fight my own disease

22:14.250 --> 22:17.290
I often ask you, God
for a piece of advice

22:17.375 --> 22:19.915
More often,
I keep away from your light

22:20.000 --> 22:22.790
I know perfectly well
that my lyrics and rhymes

22:22.875 --> 22:25.624
Don't make me
any better than you

22:25.708 --> 22:28.457
I'm just a human,
don't wanna change the world

22:28.541 --> 22:31.374
It's hard to persevere
and meet my goals

22:31.458 --> 22:34.165
I'm fighting myself,
my hands are heavy

22:34.250 --> 22:36.832
I struggle to join them
for a prayer

22:37.083 --> 22:39.832
I lack humility,
my heart begs for mercy

22:39.916 --> 22:42.874
I know I'm no role model to follow

22:42.958 --> 22:45.749
I'm fighting myself,
my hands are heavy

22:45.833 --> 22:48.290
I struggle to join them
for a prayer

22:48.375 --> 22:51.790
I lack humility
I know nothing 'bout faithfulness

22:51.875 --> 22:54.290
I know I'm no role model to follow

23:02.416 --> 23:04.749
- Yo.
- I'm busy, man.

23:11.666 --> 23:13.415
Join us when you're done.

23:16.083 --> 23:17.874
What we were up to?

23:18.666 --> 23:20.165
Up to no good.

23:26.041 --> 23:28.415
I'm more of a West Coast...

23:29.041 --> 23:30.832
kinda guy.

23:30.916 --> 23:33.624
- Jersey?
- West Coast.

23:36.416 --> 23:39.415
But I respect Diddy.

23:39.791 --> 23:41.207
It goes for itself.

23:41.666 --> 23:43.415
And you?

23:45.166 --> 23:47.290
Wanna hear something?

23:47.375 --> 23:49.582
- Wanna hear something?
- Shoot.

23:49.791 --> 23:51.749
I don't give a fuck.

23:53.250 --> 23:54.957
Man...

23:55.250 --> 23:57.915
Let's go to sleep,
'cause nothing interesting

23:58.666 --> 24:00.249
will happen here.

24:07.333 --> 24:09.457
Tomek?

24:10.791 --> 24:12.415
What's going on?

24:14.541 --> 24:16.124
Tomek?

24:17.916 --> 24:19.499
Oh, God!

24:20.875 --> 24:22.165
Tomek?

24:23.166 --> 24:25.457
Tomek, I beg you.

24:33.083 --> 24:35.874
Such a disgrace
in front of deputy mayor.

24:36.083 --> 24:38.415
Do you realize that because of you

24:38.500 --> 24:40.249
we've just lost a grant

24:40.333 --> 24:42.249
for new windows?

24:42.541 --> 24:45.040
Patients complain.
It's freezing in here!

24:46.750 --> 24:48.374
Show me this fur.

24:48.666 --> 24:50.249
Here it is.

24:54.125 --> 24:55.707
30 years as my employee.

24:55.791 --> 24:57.999
I could get you fired in a flash.

24:58.375 --> 24:59.790
I'm sorry.

25:00.541 --> 25:02.082
One more thing.

25:02.166 --> 25:03.957
I reported it to the police.

25:04.041 --> 25:05.374
But...

25:06.083 --> 25:09.374
Don't think
he'll get away with it easily.

25:09.458 --> 25:11.999
I'll take the fur cost
out of your paycheck!

25:12.083 --> 25:14.290
That's against Labour Code.

25:14.375 --> 25:17.957
It meant something in communism,
now we've got capitalism.

25:18.250 --> 25:20.332
Is it a hospital or a company?

25:20.416 --> 25:23.082
A company!
And a costly one!

25:23.166 --> 25:24.957
We need money!

25:40.541 --> 25:44.415
WARSAW, 2001

25:44.500 --> 25:45.999
Hey there!

25:48.958 --> 25:51.457
Got a lighter?

25:51.541 --> 25:53.707
- Sure I do.
- Thanks.

25:55.291 --> 25:56.749
Here you go.

25:57.791 --> 26:00.624
It's tricky with this wind.
Let's try again.

26:03.333 --> 26:06.332
Nice ride.
Nothing beats V8 sound.

26:06.416 --> 26:08.124
Thanks.

26:21.333 --> 26:24.040
Live to the fullest,
be an artist to the end

26:24.125 --> 26:26.749
Stacking loot,
take as much as I can

26:26.833 --> 26:29.457
Own a private airport
and more than one car

26:29.541 --> 26:32.207
I dream about it
as every other guy

26:32.291 --> 26:34.915
I wanna live like Messi,
have loads of cash

26:35.000 --> 26:37.582
Be a fucking Count
Monte Cristo style

26:37.666 --> 26:40.624
Not to wear any masks,
peel out down the street

26:40.708 --> 26:43.249
Live and abundant life

26:43.333 --> 26:45.165
What did you do this time?

26:46.708 --> 26:49.749
Police came.
They want you at the station.

26:51.458 --> 26:53.207
You can't drive, cunt?

26:53.291 --> 26:55.999
I really didn't mean that...

26:56.375 --> 26:58.749
I'll get you, you fuckers!

26:59.458 --> 27:02.207
Spend money like Tyson
and have no regrets

27:02.291 --> 27:04.915
Live every day
like it's my birthday

27:05.000 --> 27:07.665
Live to the fullest,
brag about my successes

27:07.750 --> 27:10.499
For once feel
like I owned a Ferrari

27:10.583 --> 27:13.165
Have no problems at all
and always be on top

27:14.541 --> 27:16.874
Damn! Leave it!

27:16.958 --> 27:19.040
Open the door!

27:21.333 --> 27:23.999
Have no problems at all
and always be on top

27:24.083 --> 27:26.665
Drink champagne
and smoke with my crew

27:26.750 --> 27:29.540
I want a fairytale life,
my own private Eden

27:37.666 --> 27:40.374
I want a red Ferrari
and my own gun collection

27:40.458 --> 27:43.457
Be wherever I want
and never worry again

27:44.750 --> 27:49.290
WARSAW, 2004

27:58.791 --> 28:00.457
Nice ride.

28:12.041 --> 28:13.582
It's yours.

28:20.416 --> 28:22.540
- For doing a great job.
- Really?

28:31.583 --> 28:33.749
But watch out for thieves.

28:44.041 --> 28:45.624
Invitation.

28:48.916 --> 28:50.874
For a wedding.

28:52.250 --> 28:54.165
I'm getting married.

29:09.500 --> 29:11.665
Dude, your tyre is flat.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.624
- What?
- Your tyre is flat.

29:13.708 --> 29:17.124
- What?
- Your tyre is flat. Whatever.

29:17.208 --> 29:19.707
You know better
than to mess with me.

29:23.625 --> 29:26.540
Best wishes to newlyweds.

29:27.208 --> 29:28.707
Health.

29:28.791 --> 29:30.249
Money.

29:31.208 --> 29:32.790
And...

29:33.208 --> 29:34.874
Kids, of course!

29:35.666 --> 29:37.332
But most importantly, money.

29:37.416 --> 29:40.707
Uncle Stefan
will take care of everything else.

29:44.500 --> 29:45.915
Thanks.

29:47.875 --> 29:50.707
All the best.
For breakfast tomorrow.

29:51.416 --> 29:53.082
After the wedding night.

29:53.833 --> 29:55.499
Meet Szajba.

29:55.583 --> 29:57.249
You're Chada?

29:57.583 --> 29:59.457
We like to eat, right?

30:01.041 --> 30:02.415
Listen.

30:03.000 --> 30:05.082
If you love freedom,

30:06.125 --> 30:07.624
do everything

30:08.250 --> 30:09.915
to avoid jail.

30:11.208 --> 30:12.874
But live

30:12.958 --> 30:14.540
as if every day was

30:14.625 --> 30:16.582
your last one as a free man.

30:18.375 --> 30:19.874
Good one.

30:19.958 --> 30:21.582
Trust me.

30:21.666 --> 30:23.207
I'm on temporary leave.

30:27.625 --> 30:30.790
- Be in Nieporęt in an hour.
- I wouldn't miss it.

30:33.750 --> 30:35.957
I was nice,
bought her cigs.

30:36.041 --> 30:38.165
C'est la vie.

30:39.375 --> 30:42.165
Chicks don't like nice guys.

30:42.250 --> 30:45.249
Keep that in mind.
Now you look good.

30:47.916 --> 30:49.499
Groom.

30:50.666 --> 30:52.665
Good evening.
Tomasz Chada?

30:53.125 --> 30:54.665
And what if?

30:54.750 --> 30:56.332
Eat shit.

30:58.458 --> 31:00.207
Come with us.

31:02.083 --> 31:03.582
Come on.

31:13.833 --> 31:15.749
Open your mouth!

31:15.833 --> 31:17.624
Feels good?

31:19.750 --> 31:21.749
You'll tell us everything!

31:25.041 --> 31:27.207
He said anything?

31:28.875 --> 31:31.415
Nope.
Plays a tough one.

31:31.750 --> 31:35.082
You can't drink before swimming.

31:35.166 --> 31:37.165
Open it!

31:40.291 --> 31:41.790
Nothing?

31:42.791 --> 31:44.332
Halo?

31:52.458 --> 31:54.665
Breathe!

31:58.208 --> 31:59.957
This girl, Łysa.

32:00.041 --> 32:01.999
I'm the only one bold.

32:02.083 --> 32:04.415
Sure?

32:04.791 --> 32:06.874
And now, how many do you see?

32:07.166 --> 32:10.082
Answer me!
How many?

32:10.166 --> 32:13.999
- Say it, you fuck!
- Great reflexes.

32:15.500 --> 32:16.957
Bitch.

32:19.416 --> 32:21.957
Chief inspector,
Żaneta Braniszewska.

32:22.041 --> 32:23.915
Circumstances have changed.

32:24.000 --> 32:25.624
OK.

32:25.708 --> 32:27.415
Enough foreplay.

32:27.791 --> 32:30.749
Now you'll tell us everything.

32:32.250 --> 32:33.790
Otherwise...

32:33.875 --> 32:35.457
you'll be charged

32:35.541 --> 32:36.832
with possession

32:36.916 --> 32:39.749
and drug dealing.

32:39.833 --> 32:43.999
And theft of deputy mayor's fur.

32:44.083 --> 32:46.040
See, bro?

32:46.583 --> 32:48.582
You won't get out of jail quickly.

32:48.666 --> 32:50.415
You know what they do...

32:51.458 --> 32:53.707
to pretty chicks like you?

32:54.166 --> 32:55.874
Shall we do a line?

32:55.958 --> 32:59.207
You want to?
You love that.

32:59.291 --> 33:01.207
There's plenty.
No one will know.

33:01.291 --> 33:03.790
You want to, you fucker?

33:07.583 --> 33:09.040
He said anything?

33:09.750 --> 33:11.124
Not yet,

33:11.208 --> 33:12.665
but he's about to.

33:14.375 --> 33:15.790
I'm taking him over.

33:16.958 --> 33:18.290
Say what?

33:20.000 --> 33:21.790
Take him to the nearby bar.

33:22.625 --> 33:24.082
My treat.

33:27.208 --> 33:28.707
Hurry up.

33:29.583 --> 33:31.082
See ya.

33:50.458 --> 33:52.207
Return it to the dispatcher.

33:53.833 --> 33:56.832
Stop staring
and get the fuck out.

34:07.625 --> 34:10.498
- What happened?
- What did you do this time?

34:10.750 --> 34:12.915
Police searched your place again.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.748
Leave it!
What happened?

34:14.833 --> 34:17.456
If I had a son like that, I'd kill him!

34:52.166 --> 34:54.748
Shall I call you Mrs Łysa now?

34:57.041 --> 34:58.665
Why look like shit?

35:00.041 --> 35:01.499
You're high?

35:03.708 --> 35:05.249
Mum's in hospital.

35:06.083 --> 35:08.790
Had a heart attack
after a police search.

35:09.500 --> 35:11.249
It happens.

35:11.875 --> 35:13.457
There's a gig.

35:13.541 --> 35:15.749
- Revived cars.
- Passats?

35:15.833 --> 35:17.540
Bulk quantities.

35:17.625 --> 35:19.790
Old and new ones.

35:19.875 --> 35:22.457
Bring them to the Tinsmith
to Goździków Street.

35:22.541 --> 35:24.165
Repeat.

35:24.875 --> 35:26.832
My mum's barely made it.

35:28.291 --> 35:30.082
I'm not asking for a favour.

35:32.333 --> 35:33.790
You owe me.

35:37.916 --> 35:40.874
Lowlifes,
that's what we are

35:40.958 --> 35:43.624
One is a car thief,
the other is a smuggler

35:43.708 --> 35:46.499
We walk arm in arm,
always in the name of God

35:46.583 --> 35:49.499
We seek the truth
and illegal profits

35:51.291 --> 35:53.624
I'll be there in a sec.

35:54.625 --> 35:56.665
No worries, mum.

35:58.083 --> 36:00.665
We seek the truth
and illegal profits

36:00.750 --> 36:03.582
You're at the crossroad,
every way leads to jail

36:03.666 --> 36:06.415
Politicians are liars,
so we never trust them

36:06.500 --> 36:09.207
Here you steal
That's what we're after

36:09.291 --> 36:12.124
Times have changed,
no 3:10 train to Yuma

36:12.208 --> 36:14.999
We've got our views
and laugh at law and order

36:15.083 --> 36:18.040
Always live against the rules

36:20.375 --> 36:22.957
Open the fucking door!

36:28.958 --> 36:31.249
Did you go to the bank

36:31.875 --> 36:33.874
to get my paycheck?

36:33.958 --> 36:36.374
Money should be
on my account.

36:36.458 --> 36:38.249
Yes.

36:38.958 --> 36:41.082
- Oh, God.
- Slowly.

36:42.333 --> 36:44.040
Now, take envelopes

36:44.875 --> 36:46.915
from the cupboard.

36:48.708 --> 36:51.915
Split money for rent and gas.

36:53.416 --> 36:56.582
- Electricity and phone bills.
- I'll take care of it.

36:56.833 --> 36:59.082
- OK.
- No worries.

37:02.041 --> 37:04.332
- Done.
- I'll run the water.

37:41.458 --> 37:44.165
What the fuck?
One hundred for a living?

38:05.208 --> 38:06.915
What's up, loser?

38:07.000 --> 38:10.749
The engine will die when you stop.
The flow meter must be replaced.

38:12.166 --> 38:14.790
Got legs? Then use them.

38:17.083 --> 38:19.082
You need my help?

38:21.958 --> 38:23.582
Take care.

38:28.541 --> 38:30.749
Hey! You look familiar.

38:36.416 --> 38:40.040
WARSAW, 2005

38:40.125 --> 38:41.999
You are not raising your leg.

38:42.083 --> 38:44.374
- Which one?
- Left one.

38:46.500 --> 38:48.790
- Do I need to?
- Wait.

38:51.041 --> 38:53.499
- I'm Tomek.
- Michał.

38:54.583 --> 38:56.707
Can I try?

38:56.791 --> 38:59.707
Stand in the middle.

39:00.041 --> 39:02.165
Your board is smaller than mine.

39:02.250 --> 39:05.124
You lean on one leg
and slide the other.

39:06.875 --> 39:08.665
Crouch down.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.415
And jump.

39:11.500 --> 39:13.915
Exactly!

39:14.500 --> 39:16.582
Now slide this leg

39:17.125 --> 39:18.915
as if you stepped in poo

39:19.416 --> 39:21.040
and wanted to wipe it off.

39:21.833 --> 39:24.249
That's it!
Hold on.

39:26.083 --> 39:27.832
That's great.

39:27.916 --> 39:30.665
I'll hold it,
try to jump off this leg.

39:32.041 --> 39:34.040
Once again.

39:34.333 --> 39:36.707
Step on the tail.

39:37.541 --> 39:39.915
One more time. Good!

39:40.791 --> 39:42.124
High five!

39:42.583 --> 39:44.124
- Wow!
- You saw that?

39:44.208 --> 39:45.999
You were great.

39:47.333 --> 39:49.207
Look.

39:51.583 --> 39:53.207
I'm doing it.

39:53.291 --> 39:54.874
Careful.

39:59.416 --> 40:01.540
I owe you something for the lesson?

40:01.625 --> 40:03.415
Mr Instructor?

40:04.583 --> 40:06.290
300.

40:08.250 --> 40:10.457
Just joking.
Flowers will do.

40:10.791 --> 40:12.207
Or dinner.

40:25.000 --> 40:26.874
You're fucking awesome.

40:32.666 --> 40:34.832
I'll be rich and famous too.

40:37.750 --> 40:39.874
But you need to know one thing.

40:43.083 --> 40:45.665
- Hip hop is my number one.
- Really?

40:45.750 --> 40:47.999
Where does this put me then?

40:48.958 --> 40:51.707
- Somewhere.
- I'm being serious.

40:55.125 --> 40:56.874
By my side.

41:05.375 --> 41:06.999
You want some?

41:07.375 --> 41:09.082
No, I'll have a drink.

41:18.458 --> 41:21.332
We leave behind
bluffing and pretending

41:21.416 --> 41:24.290
Of hopeless artists
and worthless actors

41:24.375 --> 41:27.540
We've got each other,
nothing we can't do

41:27.625 --> 41:30.624
We've got each other,
The rest doesn't matter

41:35.416 --> 41:36.957
Who's next?

41:44.375 --> 41:45.999
Wanna go to a concert?

41:46.541 --> 41:47.790
Man.

41:48.291 --> 41:49.665
We gotta talk.

41:50.500 --> 41:51.790
What's up?

42:02.375 --> 42:03.790
You got more of that?

42:06.416 --> 42:08.124
I'm recording a solo album.

42:09.708 --> 42:11.874
Chada is making it solo.

42:14.833 --> 42:16.290
Fine by me.

42:26.333 --> 42:27.999
I have a record company.

42:31.250 --> 42:33.040
You found yourself a label?

42:37.541 --> 42:38.999
Seems like I do now.

42:39.083 --> 42:42.040
This is my solo,
so no more losing

42:42.125 --> 42:44.624
I'll say what needs to be said

42:44.708 --> 42:47.332
Surrounded by people
who I can count on

42:47.416 --> 42:50.082
Raised in the streets
and very ill-tempered

42:50.166 --> 42:52.624
Fucking cops
continue their haunt

42:52.708 --> 42:55.082
Chada is not messing with you

42:55.166 --> 42:57.707
If you're broke,
then steal this album

42:57.791 --> 43:00.332
I'm not asking you to pay for it

43:00.416 --> 43:02.957
I shed some light
in a room full of darkness

43:03.041 --> 43:05.582
But you're still feeling anxious

43:05.666 --> 43:08.207
Just like you
I've got a plan for life

43:08.291 --> 43:10.749
But it's not
for white collar scums

43:10.833 --> 43:13.374
I play hip hop
for shitty money

43:13.458 --> 43:16.207
I'm the donor
and you're the recipient

43:16.458 --> 43:18.040
What the fuck?

43:18.125 --> 43:19.707
You need an invitation?

43:19.791 --> 43:23.707
Tell me how much I owe you.
No more stealing.

43:23.791 --> 43:26.457
My mum is sick.
I'm making an album.

43:26.541 --> 43:28.124
I've had enough.

43:28.208 --> 43:30.540
We're not settled yet.

43:32.208 --> 43:33.790
Champion?

43:45.583 --> 43:47.124
She has a kid.

43:51.916 --> 43:53.790
A boy or a girl?

43:55.708 --> 43:57.790
Michał.
He's a smart boy.

43:57.875 --> 43:59.332
He's six.

43:59.875 --> 44:01.374
Nice age.

44:02.875 --> 44:04.707
You were such a cutie then.

44:06.041 --> 44:08.540
- You started acting up later.
- Mum...

44:09.833 --> 44:11.374
Tomek...

44:13.000 --> 44:15.207
You're not taking drugs anymore?

44:17.166 --> 44:18.999
I've told you already.

44:21.750 --> 44:23.415
That's good.

44:24.458 --> 44:26.832
When will you invite them for dinner?

44:29.125 --> 44:30.582
Tell me.

44:34.000 --> 44:36.207
Yo, bro.

44:36.291 --> 44:38.332
- How are you?
- Been better.

44:38.541 --> 44:40.874
Behind the scene my crew waiting

44:40.958 --> 44:43.499
Raised in the streets and ill-tempered

44:43.583 --> 44:46.124
Fucking cops continue their haunt

44:46.208 --> 44:48.707
Chada is not messing with you

44:48.791 --> 44:51.332
If you're broke,
then steal this album

44:51.416 --> 44:54.040
I'm not asking you to pay for it

44:57.500 --> 44:59.290
Rewind a little.

44:59.666 --> 45:01.332
Get in here.

45:03.208 --> 45:04.749
Take a break.

45:04.833 --> 45:06.374
Sure.

45:10.333 --> 45:11.790
I need cash.

45:12.708 --> 45:14.707
- For what?
- That's my business.

45:15.166 --> 45:16.582
Why are you snuffling?

45:17.500 --> 45:19.290
- Got an allergy.
- Yeah?

45:19.375 --> 45:21.082
What's that?

45:21.333 --> 45:22.915
Flour?

45:25.208 --> 45:27.165
I found it in your things.

45:27.250 --> 45:29.457
You don't get it, you knucklefuck?

45:29.541 --> 45:31.332
You douchebag?

45:31.416 --> 45:32.915
I invested money in you.

45:33.000 --> 45:35.499
I believe in you.
I let you in the studio.

45:36.208 --> 45:38.332
You're good.
Get your shit together!

45:38.416 --> 45:40.957
Record the album,
write songs.

45:41.208 --> 45:44.374
He was such a good boy.

45:46.416 --> 45:48.915
He was doing really well in school.

45:49.583 --> 45:51.249
- Nice.
- I don't believe it.

45:51.333 --> 45:53.040
Is it that hard to believe?

45:54.500 --> 45:56.832
I'll show you how cute he was.

45:57.208 --> 45:59.707
- Mum, don't.
- Come on!

46:00.750 --> 46:02.499
Here you go.

46:03.125 --> 46:05.915
Holidays in Szklarska Poręba.

46:06.166 --> 46:09.707
Workplaces had their summer centres.

46:09.791 --> 46:13.290
Unions too, nurses involved.
Interesting times.

46:13.375 --> 46:15.499
See how cute he was?

46:16.583 --> 46:18.999
I've got more photos.

46:19.875 --> 46:21.707
Graduation...

46:21.791 --> 46:23.957
This one is so cute!

46:24.041 --> 46:26.249
He looks just like you in this one.

46:26.333 --> 46:28.249
Look at this.

46:28.916 --> 46:31.415
Handsome little gentleman.
Nice haircut.

46:31.500 --> 46:34.374
Ironed pants, white shirt.

46:35.291 --> 46:37.540
I made sure
he always looked elegant.

46:38.916 --> 46:41.582
Almost like you.

46:41.750 --> 46:44.290
Finish dinner
and I'll grab another album.

46:44.666 --> 46:47.790
- Mum, stop.
- Let go of me.

47:25.750 --> 47:27.874
Not everything at once.

47:31.666 --> 47:33.790
You can't get upset.

47:33.875 --> 47:35.415
It's old stuff.

47:35.500 --> 47:37.165
I'm clean.
I swear.

47:37.250 --> 47:38.665
Of course, you do.

47:38.750 --> 47:40.457
You can't trust me once?

47:40.541 --> 47:42.040
Trust you?

47:42.125 --> 47:44.582
Did that more than once.

47:44.666 --> 47:46.624
I've trusted you already.

47:50.375 --> 47:52.374
What are you doing?

47:53.458 --> 47:55.457
You're just like your father.

47:55.708 --> 47:57.915
Are you going somewhere?

47:59.708 --> 48:01.207
Tomek.

48:01.750 --> 48:04.499
This house is too small
for the two of us.

48:05.958 --> 48:07.665
You stay here.

48:08.000 --> 48:09.707
Stay here.

48:09.791 --> 48:11.915
Don't bother looking for me.

48:14.750 --> 48:16.582
- Stop!
- Sit down.

48:17.791 --> 48:19.457
You're not going anywhere.

48:23.000 --> 48:24.457
Nice.

48:24.666 --> 48:27.457
What else are you gonna do
to your mother?

48:27.708 --> 48:29.290
Go ahead.

48:31.000 --> 48:32.457
I can't help you anymore.

48:33.416 --> 48:35.832
If you can't stand me,
I'm moving out.

48:39.291 --> 48:41.040
Let's go.

48:43.625 --> 48:45.040
Let's go.

48:47.416 --> 48:50.374
- Can I finish my potatoes?
- I'll buy you chips.

48:50.458 --> 48:52.207
- OK?
- Fine.

48:54.833 --> 48:56.915
I'm sorry, I'll try...

49:12.375 --> 49:14.832
You said we'd get chips.

49:19.166 --> 49:21.165
Go upstairs,
I'll be in a sec.

49:22.375 --> 49:24.499
I'll make you chips at home.

49:24.583 --> 49:26.624
Wait for me over there.

49:27.250 --> 49:28.749
Tomek!

49:29.791 --> 49:31.374
You know what you're doing?

49:32.333 --> 49:35.165
He lost one dad.
He can't lose another.

49:35.250 --> 49:37.290
You should understand that.

49:37.375 --> 49:39.290
Your father wasn't around.

49:40.583 --> 49:43.207
- Quit that shit.
- You're not my wife.

49:45.625 --> 49:48.415
You can treat
your mother like that, not me.

49:49.125 --> 49:51.207
You're done?
I'll be back soon.

49:51.291 --> 49:53.457
Start using your fucking brain.

50:03.750 --> 50:05.332
Fill it up.

50:05.416 --> 50:08.332
It's 5 am and I'm ready

50:08.416 --> 50:11.332
To take another step,
get closer to heaven

50:11.416 --> 50:14.290
I carry ash in my pocket,
I accept criticism

50:14.375 --> 50:17.249
if I need to,
I'll admit to mistakes I've made

50:17.333 --> 50:20.207
I live that shit,
nothing ever changes

50:20.291 --> 50:23.290
I'm going mental
and act like a kid

50:23.375 --> 50:26.207
I appreciate life,
think about my needs

50:26.291 --> 50:29.290
Nothing ever fell
from the sky for me

50:29.375 --> 50:32.207
Dark thoughts in my head,
drowning in problems

50:33.458 --> 50:34.957
You got something?

50:37.750 --> 50:39.165
I'm in a bar.

50:40.416 --> 50:41.915
On Wiatraczna Street.

50:55.125 --> 50:57.249
- Hi, Pablo.
- Yo.

50:57.500 --> 51:00.207
You look super fly.

51:00.291 --> 51:02.082
Nice, right?

51:02.166 --> 51:03.790
You risk, you prosper.

51:03.875 --> 51:06.374
- Sit down.
- I'm working for Łysa.

51:07.250 --> 51:09.165
They call me "Crime" now.

51:10.416 --> 51:12.874
- Better than "Dime".
- Got dough?

51:14.791 --> 51:16.457
Fuck, man.

51:17.750 --> 51:20.040
For old times' sake.

51:22.916 --> 51:24.457
From a friend.

51:27.583 --> 51:29.457
WARSAW, 2007

51:29.541 --> 51:31.499
- You're done?
- Thank you.

51:31.583 --> 51:34.207
- Can I play?
- Sure.

51:59.666 --> 52:02.540
There are two of us,
one nice and organized

52:02.625 --> 52:05.332
Other not suited
and a bit derailed

52:05.416 --> 52:08.165
First keeps his word
and is a smooth talker

52:08.250 --> 52:10.832
Other make promises,
but never calls back

52:10.916 --> 52:13.665
First avoids parties,
stays away from troubles

52:13.750 --> 52:16.540
Other calls his dealer
and smoke another one

52:16.625 --> 52:19.207
First wakes at dawn
and hits the gym

52:19.291 --> 52:22.124
Other wakes at dusk,
feeling like a failure

52:22.208 --> 52:24.915
First one records in a studio
and cleans his place

52:25.000 --> 52:27.749
Other is never clean
and records shit

52:27.833 --> 52:30.374
First greets neighbours,
has a healthy diet

52:30.458 --> 52:33.249
Other starts a fight
and eats junk food

52:33.333 --> 52:35.957
First saves up money
and does people favours

52:36.041 --> 52:38.790
Other spends everything,
sinking into debts

52:38.875 --> 52:41.707
First enjoys a book
and asks if you're free

52:41.791 --> 52:44.415
Other vulgar and rude...

52:44.500 --> 52:46.707
Are you listening to me?

52:46.791 --> 52:48.457
Is anybody there?

52:48.916 --> 52:51.332
Michał, go out for a moment.

52:58.291 --> 53:01.040
Maybe you should find
a normal job.

53:05.958 --> 53:08.624
I'm sorry. That's your work.

53:08.708 --> 53:11.082
I've offended you, my prince.

53:11.166 --> 53:14.249
Cause I've asked you to pay the bills?

53:14.333 --> 53:16.374
Buy food from time to time?

53:17.416 --> 53:19.124
Clothes for the kid?

53:19.916 --> 53:21.624
His name is Michał.

53:26.000 --> 53:27.624
I have a job.
Making an album.

53:28.208 --> 53:32.290
You're making it since fucking ages!

53:32.750 --> 53:35.540
No one gives a shit!

53:37.833 --> 53:40.374
- I give a shit.
- What are you doing?

53:41.750 --> 53:43.957
- What are you doing?
- Dreaming.

53:44.458 --> 53:46.874
I'm talking to you, Tomek.

53:46.958 --> 53:48.374
Tomek.

53:48.458 --> 53:50.332
Speak back to me.

53:54.041 --> 53:55.790
What's up?

53:55.875 --> 53:58.790
Where are you going? Stay!

53:58.875 --> 54:01.249
- Let go.
- Or you'll hit me?

54:01.916 --> 54:03.624
Like your mother?

54:06.458 --> 54:08.624
- Please, don't.
- Calm down.

54:09.083 --> 54:10.790
Tomek, stop.

54:11.875 --> 54:14.374
Order a pizza and
a friendly delivery boy.

54:14.666 --> 54:17.082
You fucking faggot!

54:42.375 --> 54:44.249
Never call me on this number.

54:45.708 --> 54:48.040
I'm not saying that again.
What's up?

54:50.166 --> 54:51.874
I want my job back.

54:52.875 --> 54:54.457
I work with Pablo now.

54:56.583 --> 54:58.124
I know that.

54:58.708 --> 55:00.624
Problem is,
you know too much.

55:04.083 --> 55:06.207
Maybe you need something extra.

55:06.291 --> 55:08.207
I can work on my own.

55:09.250 --> 55:11.165
We need to step back a little.

55:11.750 --> 55:13.457
Haven't you watched the news?

55:15.083 --> 55:16.749
I'm sorry
for the other time.

55:19.750 --> 55:21.415
We'll talk about it.

55:23.333 --> 55:25.957
I need you now.
Like never before.

55:34.708 --> 55:37.790
Maybe I'll need
a job done for Tinman.

55:37.875 --> 55:40.957
Maybe Beetle or else.
I'll let you know.

55:41.500 --> 55:43.040
Now what?

55:43.125 --> 55:44.624
We set out some carrots?

55:47.375 --> 55:49.165
And throw in a rabbit.

56:01.250 --> 56:02.957
Good morning.

56:03.208 --> 56:04.915
Two pears, please.

56:12.208 --> 56:14.124
He took a bait.

56:27.833 --> 56:29.415
Łysa?

56:35.958 --> 56:37.374
Where did you find it?

56:37.458 --> 56:39.582
I got lucky.
I had to steal it.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.707
Fuck me!

56:46.791 --> 56:48.790
It was parked in my neighbourhood.

56:48.875 --> 56:50.790
What a fucking coincidence!

56:54.041 --> 56:55.999
Freeze!

56:57.416 --> 57:00.165
Freeze! Police!

57:14.000 --> 57:15.749
Shit.

57:20.041 --> 57:22.624
- You're looking for someone?
- Say what?

57:24.583 --> 57:26.124
For you.

57:26.833 --> 57:28.332
Without a warning?

57:29.666 --> 57:31.207
I could have left.

57:31.291 --> 57:33.374
We wanted to surprise you.

57:34.458 --> 57:36.124
And you did.

57:38.791 --> 57:40.457
Can I use my phone?

57:44.041 --> 57:45.415
Which number?

57:48.833 --> 57:50.374
Who should I call?

57:50.750 --> 57:52.290
Last dialed number.

58:03.541 --> 58:05.374
And I'm fucked.

58:05.458 --> 58:07.165
Don't move.

58:07.250 --> 58:11.457
Officer Zapolska,
Central Anticorruption Bureau.

58:12.833 --> 58:15.040
Who are you calling?

58:16.583 --> 58:18.707
Someone
who will teach you manners.

58:20.458 --> 58:22.207
Make that call.

58:25.375 --> 58:27.165
You're getting soft?

58:29.916 --> 58:31.374
What now?

58:35.625 --> 58:37.290
No one answers?

58:38.083 --> 58:41.290
He was 28,
living in slavery and pain

58:41.375 --> 58:44.415
Quickly he lost
all of the control

58:45.208 --> 58:47.040
You have a smoke?

58:47.583 --> 58:49.207
Go fuck yourself.

58:50.458 --> 58:53.290
He took hard drugs,
guy got him addicted

58:53.375 --> 58:56.249
He was hopelessly drifting
in that fateful river

58:56.333 --> 58:59.582
Had another problem,
his father was a drunk

58:59.666 --> 59:02.582
He blamed him
for ending up in a rehab

59:02.666 --> 59:05.415
He didn't hear
anyone laughing

59:05.500 --> 59:08.249
Had problems with people
that had no hope

59:08.333 --> 59:11.124
Was afraid of dreaming,
he chose a street life

59:11.208 --> 59:14.207
But was always full of doubt

59:14.583 --> 59:17.457
He had enough,
raised his eyes to the sky

59:17.708 --> 59:20.499
She was there
and told him to jump

59:20.583 --> 59:23.499
He did as she said,
he wanted to die

59:24.625 --> 59:26.707
There was no turning back

59:37.041 --> 59:39.707
We will bring you prawns
in a second.

59:40.416 --> 59:42.207
Thank you.

59:44.333 --> 59:47.082
Good evening.
How can I help you?

01:00:01.333 --> 01:00:03.082
Your room is ready.

01:00:03.833 --> 01:00:05.374
One moment.

01:00:06.250 --> 01:00:08.749
Room 316. Fifth floor.

01:00:10.291 --> 01:00:11.915
Problems with the lady?

01:00:22.291 --> 01:00:24.915
Police?
Not sure if that's relevant,

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:28.332
but there's a drunk man
who uses someone else's ID.

01:00:30.458 --> 01:00:32.415
Don't leave me now.

01:00:37.375 --> 01:00:39.249
I'll do anything.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.374
I can check tickets in trams.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.082
I'll do whatever you want.

01:00:47.416 --> 01:00:49.790
I can deliver pizza.

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:53.915
- Get down, you idiot!
- Shut up and put your gun away.

01:00:55.500 --> 01:00:56.999
Put it away.

01:00:58.833 --> 01:01:00.332
Buddy!

01:01:01.166 --> 01:01:02.790
Bro.

01:01:02.875 --> 01:01:05.165
You hear me?
You've reasons to live.

01:01:06.208 --> 01:01:07.999
Don't move.

01:01:08.708 --> 01:01:10.332
We'll get you...

01:01:11.041 --> 01:01:13.165
I know you.
My chick is your fan.

01:01:13.250 --> 01:01:14.957
And you wanna jump? Really?

01:01:15.041 --> 01:01:16.457
Buddy!

01:01:18.041 --> 01:01:20.124
Got you!

01:01:20.208 --> 01:01:22.290
- Hands down.
- Good call.

01:01:23.375 --> 01:01:24.874
Motherfucker.

01:01:30.750 --> 01:01:32.124
Sorry.

01:01:33.666 --> 01:01:35.457
Get out of here!

01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:39.332
Police!
It's serious! Get out!

01:01:59.708 --> 01:02:01.374
Mummy.

01:02:04.625 --> 01:02:06.165
Where am I?

01:02:07.583 --> 01:02:09.290
Praski Hospital.

01:02:10.125 --> 01:02:11.957
My mum works here.

01:02:15.166 --> 01:02:17.915
Worked.
Left six months ago.

01:02:31.416 --> 01:02:35.332
I got you best producers,
sold out tickets and now what?

01:02:39.333 --> 01:02:41.874
- You'll hold my mic.
- Fuck!

01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:44.999
I need a doctor!

01:02:45.083 --> 01:02:48.207
Calm down.
I woke up yesterday.

01:02:51.666 --> 01:02:53.749
What the fuck did you just pull?

01:02:53.833 --> 01:02:55.624
Cops are watching you.

01:02:55.708 --> 01:02:58.165
DA issued a warrant for the arrest.

01:02:58.250 --> 01:03:00.457
They're waiting
for you to get better.

01:03:00.541 --> 01:03:02.374
What can I do about it?

01:03:03.625 --> 01:03:04.957
Listen.

01:03:05.375 --> 01:03:07.957
You barely made it.

01:03:08.416 --> 01:03:11.124
Let's say you got crazy
because of this.

01:03:11.541 --> 01:03:13.624
I've already talked to a lawyer.

01:03:13.708 --> 01:03:16.957
- He'll put you in a psych ward.
- Like some lunatic?

01:03:17.958 --> 01:03:19.665
You prefer jail?

01:03:29.708 --> 01:03:33.415
- Where are you going?
- To the chapel.

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:36.582
- Not possible.
- I'm barely walking.

01:03:36.666 --> 01:03:39.707
I wanted to thank God
for being alive.

01:03:41.041 --> 01:03:43.582
It's against the rules.
Back to your room.

01:03:47.708 --> 01:03:50.249
We'll go together.
Don't pull anything.

01:03:51.083 --> 01:03:52.707
Understood?

01:03:59.708 --> 01:04:01.165
Holy Mother.

01:04:04.333 --> 01:04:06.082
Holy Mother.

01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:11.582
My dear mother.

01:04:14.125 --> 01:04:16.124
You came to me.

01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:18.874
I thought you abandoned me.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.124
Look at that halo over your head.

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:25.540
You're so beautiful.

01:04:25.625 --> 01:04:27.749
Take me to Bethlehem with you.

01:04:29.125 --> 01:04:31.832
Shepherds came to Bethlehem...

01:04:31.916 --> 01:04:34.749
My dear and sweet mum.

01:04:35.041 --> 01:04:37.540
I'm not worthy of kissing your feet.

01:04:41.083 --> 01:04:43.040
You also came to me?

01:04:43.125 --> 01:04:45.790
- My dear father!
- Doctor!

01:04:45.875 --> 01:04:48.582
You're not gonna leave me this time.

01:04:49.708 --> 01:04:52.582
Lord is my shepherd!

01:04:52.666 --> 01:04:55.457
I have everything.

01:04:55.541 --> 01:04:57.999
Lord is my shepherd.

01:04:58.083 --> 01:05:00.707
I have everything.

01:05:00.791 --> 01:05:02.915
He let me lay

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.499
on green pastures.

01:05:05.583 --> 01:05:08.290
Calm down, mister.

01:05:08.375 --> 01:05:09.957
Easy.

01:05:10.041 --> 01:05:12.040
Try to relax.

01:05:14.333 --> 01:05:16.915
That's right. Relax.

01:05:23.083 --> 01:05:25.790
Just try to chill.

01:05:38.458 --> 01:05:42.290
Your friend came by,
but the chief didn't let him in.

01:05:42.958 --> 01:05:44.832
Did he say his name?

01:05:44.916 --> 01:05:46.832
He did.

01:05:47.250 --> 01:05:49.540
Pablo.
You've got nice friends.

01:05:51.625 --> 01:05:54.040
One for your friend?

01:05:54.958 --> 01:05:56.124
No.

01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:59.415
One for my future wife.

01:06:00.583 --> 01:06:02.457
You're missing her.

01:06:03.083 --> 01:06:04.540
Why should I?

01:06:05.208 --> 01:06:06.957
You're right next to me.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.374
Hi.

01:06:40.458 --> 01:06:41.957
Aren't you bored in here?

01:06:42.041 --> 01:06:43.582
Not anymore.

01:06:51.416 --> 01:06:54.499
You wanted something stronger.

01:06:56.083 --> 01:06:57.624
I got you this.

01:07:06.125 --> 01:07:09.207
A toast for your future wife?

01:07:22.833 --> 01:07:25.665
You know what did you just take?

01:07:30.208 --> 01:07:31.874
I always know.

01:07:31.958 --> 01:07:35.374
Maybe it shouldn't be mixed
with alcohol.

01:07:36.791 --> 01:07:39.332
It's best
when mixed with alcohol.

01:07:44.041 --> 01:07:45.749
Not there.

01:07:56.958 --> 01:07:59.457
Chada!

01:07:59.541 --> 01:08:02.415
Come on!

01:08:04.041 --> 01:08:06.082
Come down here!

01:08:06.166 --> 01:08:07.999
We're going to Germany.

01:08:08.083 --> 01:08:10.415
We'll be filthy reach!

01:08:24.250 --> 01:08:26.665
What the fuck?

01:08:39.791 --> 01:08:41.207
It concerns Chada.

01:08:41.291 --> 01:08:43.374
Don't sleep, you nuts,

01:08:43.457 --> 01:08:45.957
take your pills
and work your ass off!

01:08:46.041 --> 01:08:48.332
Take your pills
and work your ass off!

01:08:51.082 --> 01:08:53.290
I wanna shoot, Pablo!

01:08:59.500 --> 01:09:02.124
Come to us, bro!

01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:03.915
Hurry up!

01:09:06.207 --> 01:09:07.957
Cops are coming.

01:09:15.707 --> 01:09:18.040
Drop your weapon!

01:09:18.125 --> 01:09:19.374
Suck my dick!

01:09:27.957 --> 01:09:29.665
Enjoy, girls.

01:09:34.916 --> 01:09:38.332
Can you sleep on the upper deck?
I'm afraid of heights.

01:09:40.041 --> 01:09:41.915
Did you hear that slut?

01:09:44.875 --> 01:09:46.332
You know the flow?

01:09:46.625 --> 01:09:47.707
No.

01:09:52.082 --> 01:09:54.082
So you're fucked!

01:09:54.166 --> 01:09:56.082
Leave him!

01:09:57.541 --> 01:10:00.749
Leave this fucker,
or you'll get more time.

01:10:00.833 --> 01:10:02.749
- Leave it for now.
- It's Chada.

01:10:02.833 --> 01:10:04.415
Shut da fuck up!

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:07.124
You're fucking blind.

01:10:07.208 --> 01:10:09.249
If you're Chada,
then prove it.

01:10:09.333 --> 01:10:11.165
Rhyme, Chada.

01:10:14.875 --> 01:10:17.165
Still breathing,
got an appetite for life

01:10:17.250 --> 01:10:19.999
Air doesn't smell
like women in here

01:10:20.375 --> 01:10:22.832
Feel this vibe,
it's a fucking prison

01:10:22.916 --> 01:10:25.624
Clocks measure years,
not hours in here

01:10:27.291 --> 01:10:30.332
- He's good.
- Get your ass down and make him coffee.

01:10:33.083 --> 01:10:34.832
Play it again.

01:10:38.375 --> 01:10:40.707
He's good.
He's rapping.

01:10:41.208 --> 01:10:43.582
Hold your head high,
it'll be all right

01:10:43.666 --> 01:10:46.790
Those are only fucked
who have no return tickets

01:10:47.041 --> 01:10:49.374
Imagine that
not everything is lost

01:10:49.458 --> 01:10:52.707
The time will come
and you'll hear the bell again

01:10:53.625 --> 01:10:56.499
Sign this.
For my kid.

01:10:57.625 --> 01:10:59.999
- What's that?
- Was released yesterday.

01:11:00.666 --> 01:11:02.457
For Kinga.

01:11:03.208 --> 01:11:04.957
That'll make her happy.

01:11:11.583 --> 01:11:13.332
Later.

01:11:24.166 --> 01:11:25.332
Hey.

01:11:25.416 --> 01:11:27.374
Now I'll rap for you.

01:11:28.833 --> 01:11:30.499
Sure.

01:11:32.083 --> 01:11:34.832
Cops fucked you deep,
no drugs there in town

01:11:34.916 --> 01:11:37.957
But I'll bring some tomorrow
and we'll hit a disco

01:11:38.041 --> 01:11:42.207
We'll screw up some more,
and hunt for hot chicks

01:11:42.291 --> 01:11:46.082
You can take these fucking lyrics
and shove them up your ass!

01:11:48.166 --> 01:11:49.707
Relax.

01:11:49.791 --> 01:11:51.665
I was joking.

01:11:55.041 --> 01:11:56.540
Three.

01:11:57.333 --> 01:11:58.624
Gentlemen.

01:11:58.708 --> 01:12:01.749
New board games
sponsored by EU.

01:12:04.708 --> 01:12:06.374
Have fun.

01:12:07.125 --> 01:12:08.582
What's that?

01:12:08.666 --> 01:12:10.457
What the fuck do you think?

01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:13.040
- Domino?
- No. Scrabble.

01:12:13.125 --> 01:12:14.790
How you play that?

01:12:14.875 --> 01:12:17.499
- You make up words.
- What words?

01:12:17.583 --> 01:12:19.165
- You know any?
- I do.

01:12:19.250 --> 01:12:22.332
- So put'em on the table.
- There are many games.

01:12:23.458 --> 01:12:25.040
Many ways of playing it.

01:12:25.666 --> 01:12:28.165
We can come up
with animal names.

01:12:28.250 --> 01:12:29.874
What animals?

01:12:29.958 --> 01:12:32.415
- Don't you know any animals?
- I do.

01:12:38.666 --> 01:12:40.165
Got one.

01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:54.415
- What's that?
- A turtlet.

01:12:57.041 --> 01:12:58.499
Like in a shell?

01:12:59.250 --> 01:13:01.040
You're saying
they're not real?

01:13:03.875 --> 01:13:06.874
- What's so funny?
- I just remembered something.

01:13:06.958 --> 01:13:08.832
What exactly, you fuck?

01:13:13.916 --> 01:13:15.582
Open the gate.

01:13:15.666 --> 01:13:19.332
WARSAW, 2010

01:13:19.708 --> 01:13:21.582
Breathe, Chada.

01:13:50.791 --> 01:13:52.457
Mum?

01:14:24.458 --> 01:14:26.082
Good morning, Mrs Woźniak.

01:14:26.166 --> 01:14:28.290
- New beret.
- It's you!

01:14:28.625 --> 01:14:31.457
I heard steps and thought

01:14:31.541 --> 01:14:34.499
that maybe your mum is back.

01:14:34.583 --> 01:14:36.332
You know where she is?

01:14:36.416 --> 01:14:38.540
- She left.
- Where to?

01:14:39.083 --> 01:14:43.290
Aunt forced her
to come and work in Canada.

01:14:44.708 --> 01:14:47.374
- She took a plane.
- I see.

01:14:48.458 --> 01:14:51.124
Thanks.
You look really nice.

01:14:59.416 --> 01:15:00.874
Yes?

01:15:02.083 --> 01:15:03.665
I'm by myself.

01:15:05.416 --> 01:15:07.249
Go to Opole?

01:15:07.333 --> 01:15:10.707
It's top quality style,
Chada is back again

01:15:10.791 --> 01:15:14.124
Will tell you how it is,
how to struggle to live

01:15:14.208 --> 01:15:17.957
But I know
I don't convince everyone

01:15:19.166 --> 01:15:22.249
Your rent for this month
is paid.

01:15:22.333 --> 01:15:24.290
OPOLE, 2019

01:15:27.875 --> 01:15:29.665
We'll settle later.

01:15:30.875 --> 01:15:32.457
Freaking nice?

01:15:32.958 --> 01:15:35.082
Nice as fuck.

01:15:35.666 --> 01:15:38.165
- Thanks, bro.
- But you know...

01:15:38.250 --> 01:15:40.040
Play it cool in here.

01:15:40.125 --> 01:15:42.374
Everyone around
knows who I am.

01:15:43.333 --> 01:15:45.749
I'll behave, relax.

01:15:45.833 --> 01:15:47.499
I don't drink anymore.

01:15:48.083 --> 01:15:49.874
You're like a saint now?

01:15:50.666 --> 01:15:52.999
I rehabilitated, man.

01:15:54.666 --> 01:15:56.915
You heard how much Łysa got?

01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:00.165
Ten years.
And she's pregnant with Szajba.

01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:05.332
- With that bagger?
- With that gangsta.

01:16:05.416 --> 01:16:07.124
She'll have the baby in jail.

01:16:32.166 --> 01:16:34.915
Fuck the police!

01:16:37.041 --> 01:16:38.790
You're mental.

01:16:40.791 --> 01:16:42.707
You'll ruin your window bars.

01:16:42.791 --> 01:16:45.499
You should go to jail, rehabilitate.

01:16:45.583 --> 01:16:48.582
Calm down a little.
I'm not working with you, man.

01:16:48.833 --> 01:16:50.499
Dogs bark their asses off.

01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:54.874
And now...
Thanks.

01:16:55.666 --> 01:16:57.332
Thanks.

01:16:57.708 --> 01:17:01.415
Make some noise for this dude!

01:17:02.750 --> 01:17:04.540
Can't hear you.

01:17:06.625 --> 01:17:08.290
Shall we go on?

01:17:09.625 --> 01:17:11.374
Shall we?

01:17:11.708 --> 01:17:13.499
Chada, Chada!

01:17:18.875 --> 01:17:21.874
Not until recently
my life was a disaster

01:17:21.958 --> 01:17:24.207
I was living a total madness

01:17:24.291 --> 01:17:27.332
Broken marriage,
problems with law

01:17:28.125 --> 01:17:30.040
Try to realize that

01:17:30.125 --> 01:17:32.207
Cops came for me
in the morning

01:17:32.291 --> 01:17:35.165
But I never told why,
where and who

01:17:36.208 --> 01:17:37.832
A fucked up phase

01:17:37.916 --> 01:17:40.207
Lies, robberies and thefts

01:17:41.791 --> 01:17:44.290
Shit is getting thicker
in these streets

01:17:44.375 --> 01:17:46.290
That take away our hopes

01:17:47.041 --> 01:17:50.874
Like one body
sometimes you lost a will to live

01:17:51.166 --> 01:17:53.749
I was naive,
my partner screwed me over

01:17:53.833 --> 01:17:56.207
I'm blaming myself,
not whining about it

01:17:56.291 --> 01:17:58.874
It got hot,
I went into hiding

01:17:58.958 --> 01:18:01.665
If I let you down,
then please forgive me

01:18:01.750 --> 01:18:03.999
If he says something,
he means it

01:18:04.083 --> 01:18:06.707
He tells how it is
and never complains

01:18:06.791 --> 01:18:09.415
He doesn't claim
he has it under control

01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:11.749
When taking a line
fourth day in a row

01:18:11.833 --> 01:18:14.707
He's one of a few
who sees hip-hop

01:18:14.791 --> 01:18:16.999
As his autobiography
and sets of laws

01:18:17.083 --> 01:18:19.624
He has some hardcore
stories to share

01:18:19.708 --> 01:18:22.665
That's what I wanna hear,
so, Chada, go on, man!

01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:25.082
Make some noise!

01:18:28.875 --> 01:18:31.624
Blue sky above,
music playing within us

01:18:31.708 --> 01:18:34.415
I go on with my shit
and I can't stop

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:37.207
Lines are full
with anger, no wonders

01:18:37.291 --> 01:18:39.832
You won't stop us,
don't even try that

01:18:39.916 --> 01:18:42.582
Blue sky above,
music playing within us

01:18:42.666 --> 01:18:45.374
I go on with my shit
and I can't stop

01:18:45.458 --> 01:18:48.165
Lines are full
with anger, no wonders

01:18:48.250 --> 01:18:50.999
You won't stop us,
don't even try that

01:19:14.916 --> 01:19:17.582
"Chada comes from another planet,

01:19:17.666 --> 01:19:21.415
where no diseases,
that decimate Polish rap scene, exist.

01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:24.582
That album was written
by life itself...

01:19:27.458 --> 01:19:29.999
Kudos, man.

01:19:30.875 --> 01:19:32.332
Thanks.

01:19:34.583 --> 01:19:36.207
Now, excuse me.

01:19:37.166 --> 01:19:38.832
And here's...

01:19:39.291 --> 01:19:40.749
your contract.

01:19:42.458 --> 01:19:44.207
For your next album.

01:19:45.083 --> 01:19:47.374
That's for the beginning.

01:19:48.333 --> 01:19:50.165
I'll transfer you the rest.

01:19:50.750 --> 01:19:52.582
Not sure
if I should sign it.

01:19:53.291 --> 01:19:55.665
Say what?! Buddy...

01:19:56.291 --> 01:19:57.749
What's going on?

01:20:00.125 --> 01:20:01.499
911?

01:20:04.916 --> 01:20:06.374
My man!

01:20:06.916 --> 01:20:09.332
You got me.
You can't fool your ID number.

01:20:09.416 --> 01:20:11.790
Come on.
Time for shopping.

01:20:13.125 --> 01:20:15.040
Contract.

01:20:24.208 --> 01:20:25.582
Thanks.

01:20:25.666 --> 01:20:28.249
I'll leave bags with you
for a moment.

01:20:32.583 --> 01:20:34.707
Can you sign this for me?

01:20:35.166 --> 01:20:37.082
- Your name?
- Justyna.

01:20:41.958 --> 01:20:43.790
Mary Christmas.

01:20:47.458 --> 01:20:49.874
- Calm down.
- I need to calm down?

01:20:49.958 --> 01:20:52.207
- Yeah, you.
- Wait a sec.

01:20:52.708 --> 01:20:55.499
Do you always
have to make a fuss?

01:20:55.583 --> 01:20:57.707
- What?
- A fuss.

01:20:58.166 --> 01:20:59.874
Do I have to tell you again

01:20:59.958 --> 01:21:03.040
to watch your fucking language
in front of a kid?

01:21:03.291 --> 01:21:05.415
I need to watch my language?

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:07.957
Don't shit yourself.

01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:17.082
Kiddo.

01:21:17.833 --> 01:21:19.624
Got any Christmas plans?

01:21:20.375 --> 01:21:23.249
Maybe a dessert?

01:21:23.333 --> 01:21:25.582
- Time for a pie?
- We'll bring plates.

01:21:25.666 --> 01:21:27.249
What's after the dessert?

01:21:27.333 --> 01:21:29.665
Gifts!

01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:31.999
- Why not now?
- 'Cause I say so.

01:21:32.083 --> 01:21:34.082
Unless you sing a Christmas carol.

01:21:36.500 --> 01:21:38.832
Beautiful!

01:21:39.166 --> 01:21:41.749
Mary was rocking her little baby...

01:21:41.833 --> 01:21:44.165
See how we spend Christmas?

01:21:52.208 --> 01:21:53.874
I'll record that.

01:22:10.958 --> 01:22:12.665
One more time.

01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:14.415
My precious angels.

01:22:19.416 --> 01:22:20.915
Tomek.

01:22:25.958 --> 01:22:27.749
There is no Christmas...

01:22:29.250 --> 01:22:31.207
without a Christmas tree.

01:22:32.083 --> 01:22:33.624
Hi, dad.

01:22:39.375 --> 01:22:42.082
Why the long faces?
Feels like a funeral.

01:22:48.416 --> 01:22:49.874
Enjoy.

01:22:50.625 --> 01:22:52.082
Thanks, dad.

01:22:57.250 --> 01:22:58.582
Where's soup?

01:23:05.791 --> 01:23:07.540
Can you ramp?

01:23:07.625 --> 01:23:08.999
Ramp?

01:23:09.083 --> 01:23:10.790
What you want me to ramp?

01:23:10.875 --> 01:23:13.915
"Proceder".

01:23:14.291 --> 01:23:16.457
Top quality rap.

01:23:17.166 --> 01:23:19.582
Now you're a rapper.
Can you ramp?

01:23:19.666 --> 01:23:21.374
I don't know.

01:23:22.291 --> 01:23:23.874
It suits you.

01:23:23.958 --> 01:23:25.707
You can keep it.

01:23:25.791 --> 01:23:27.290
You look like a pro.

01:23:27.375 --> 01:23:28.832
Thank you.

01:23:28.916 --> 01:23:31.624
Happy birthday...
That's not a carol?

01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:45.124
- Tomek, where are you?
- Here!

01:23:50.791 --> 01:23:53.665
- Where you're off to?
- Midnight Mass.

01:23:54.250 --> 01:23:56.124
We can go all together.

01:23:57.708 --> 01:24:00.499
I need to think about...

01:24:01.250 --> 01:24:02.957
things and stuff.

01:24:04.041 --> 01:24:05.957
I need to talk to God.

01:24:10.416 --> 01:24:12.457
Your family is awesome.

01:24:14.666 --> 01:24:16.332
Thanks, man.

01:24:18.291 --> 01:24:19.957
For what?

01:24:21.250 --> 01:24:23.040
For everything.

01:24:23.833 --> 01:24:25.540
Where are you going?

01:24:25.625 --> 01:24:27.582
Where the fuck are you going?

01:24:27.666 --> 01:24:29.332
I'll be back in an hour.

01:24:30.333 --> 01:24:32.124
Leave some borscht for me.

01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:06.957
- I thought you're in jail.
- Police buy from me.

01:25:07.041 --> 01:25:09.415
- Got stuff?
- Sure. Tonight is busy.

01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:13.249
Soon yuppies will come
in need of a line after supper.

01:25:13.625 --> 01:25:15.582
- How much?
- One line.

01:25:30.583 --> 01:25:32.332
See ya!

01:25:32.416 --> 01:25:34.082
Take care.

01:25:37.166 --> 01:25:38.999
Staff sergeant Kamiński.

01:25:39.083 --> 01:25:40.582
Warsaw headquarters.

01:25:40.666 --> 01:25:42.915
ID, please.
Prepare for revision.

01:26:27.291 --> 01:26:29.332
What the fuck are you doing?

01:26:31.916 --> 01:26:34.665
You know how much
it cost to bail you out?

01:26:37.291 --> 01:26:40.124
- I'll pay you back.
- I wonder how.

01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:43.374
I'll make an album.
Go on tour.

01:26:44.166 --> 01:26:45.915
I'll figure something out.

01:26:46.125 --> 01:26:49.165
When?
Before or after serving time?

01:26:50.875 --> 01:26:52.582
It's not about the money.

01:26:52.666 --> 01:26:54.457
So where are we going?

01:26:56.541 --> 01:26:58.290
Jail or rehab.

01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:00.165
I made the choice for you.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:03.707
What rehab?

01:27:03.791 --> 01:27:05.790
I'm not going to rehab.

01:27:06.750 --> 01:27:08.415
Look.

01:27:12.083 --> 01:27:13.957
I'm already clean.

01:27:20.125 --> 01:27:22.290
Stop the car!

01:27:24.791 --> 01:27:26.207
What?

01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:29.040
Stay in the fucking car!

01:27:29.125 --> 01:27:31.249
What are you doing?
Fucking hell.

01:27:31.333 --> 01:27:33.415
Close the door.

01:27:44.166 --> 01:27:47.124
We're living in times, when people

01:27:47.375 --> 01:27:49.040
from different backgrounds

01:27:49.583 --> 01:27:52.082
meet either in therapy,

01:27:53.833 --> 01:27:55.540
or in a morgue.

01:27:56.541 --> 01:27:58.165
Used to meet in church.

01:27:58.250 --> 01:27:59.457
What?

01:27:59.833 --> 01:28:03.124
Yeah, you're right.
Joining us today is

01:28:03.208 --> 01:28:05.207
a second-year psychology student,

01:28:05.833 --> 01:28:07.207
Monika.

01:28:10.791 --> 01:28:14.207
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm Monika.

01:28:15.250 --> 01:28:16.999
Also joining us

01:28:17.875 --> 01:28:19.457
is a new colleague.

01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:21.874
Tomek?

01:28:22.333 --> 01:28:23.874
Introduce yourself.

01:28:29.458 --> 01:28:30.874
You're sick?

01:28:33.416 --> 01:28:34.749
Yeah.

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.290
I knew it.

01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.665
I'm good with people.

01:28:42.250 --> 01:28:45.415
You got me figured out.
Should be another way around.

01:28:55.458 --> 01:28:57.582
We can do it
whatever style you like.

01:28:59.375 --> 01:29:00.999
You know what?

01:29:03.916 --> 01:29:05.457
It's good
that you're here.

01:29:23.625 --> 01:29:26.040
So, the pillow is me

01:29:26.416 --> 01:29:28.707
- and I'm my father?
- Yes.

01:29:29.500 --> 01:29:30.790
Daddy.

01:29:39.125 --> 01:29:40.624
Just like at home.

01:29:44.833 --> 01:29:46.332
Don't you remember?

01:29:46.416 --> 01:29:47.790
Maruś?

01:29:51.875 --> 01:29:54.040
You were giving your daddy blowjobs.

01:30:00.750 --> 01:30:03.082
Don't sweat bullets, Maruś.

01:30:04.125 --> 01:30:05.749
Maruś.

01:30:06.458 --> 01:30:08.749
- Get the fuck off me!
- Stop it!

01:30:08.833 --> 01:30:10.249
Enough!

01:30:10.333 --> 01:30:12.665
What was that?
You ruined the exercise.

01:30:12.750 --> 01:30:14.124
Tomek!

01:30:14.208 --> 01:30:16.040
Your medicine.

01:30:17.291 --> 01:30:18.874
Give me your number.

01:30:18.958 --> 01:30:20.707
Only you can help me.

01:30:20.791 --> 01:30:22.957
You know that I have issues.

01:30:23.208 --> 01:30:24.999
Give it back.

01:30:28.250 --> 01:30:30.040
Meds for a number.

01:30:40.041 --> 01:30:41.624
Just give me your number.

01:30:54.458 --> 01:30:57.457
Let's go home, dad.

01:30:57.541 --> 01:30:58.790
Dad!

01:31:04.708 --> 01:31:07.165
- Let's go home.
- I don't know you.

01:31:07.250 --> 01:31:09.165
Let's go home.

01:31:35.458 --> 01:31:37.457
Time for a smash hit.

01:31:42.291 --> 01:31:43.957
You, rapper guy.

01:31:44.041 --> 01:31:45.665
Rapper in a cap.

01:31:45.750 --> 01:31:48.040
Come and sing for us.

01:31:53.541 --> 01:31:55.165
All yours.

01:31:59.458 --> 01:32:01.915
It's all women's fault

01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:05.165
They take their clothes off
showing off almost naked

01:32:05.458 --> 01:32:08.624
Bodies.
It works with women.

01:32:08.708 --> 01:32:11.624
Women are... hot.

01:32:13.708 --> 01:32:15.124
Get down!

01:32:16.166 --> 01:32:18.415
Women are...

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:25.332
Hot...

01:32:31.541 --> 01:32:33.082
Chada.

01:32:33.375 --> 01:32:35.665
Welcome to our humble home.

01:32:36.083 --> 01:32:38.165
What day is today?

01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:40.499
Friday.

01:32:40.750 --> 01:32:42.499
For lunch is fish.

01:32:43.708 --> 01:32:46.790
If you see my mum,
tell her about me.

01:32:46.875 --> 01:32:48.707
Or better not say anything.

01:32:48.791 --> 01:32:51.499
Just take her number.

01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.707
Szajba?

01:32:55.791 --> 01:32:57.124
For you: Mr Szajba.

01:32:57.208 --> 01:32:59.374
What the fuck have you done?

01:32:59.458 --> 01:33:02.332
I can explain.
Didn't know it was a set up.

01:33:02.416 --> 01:33:05.624
You thought you're that smart?

01:33:06.166 --> 01:33:08.374
Cheat your mum.
Cheat your dad.

01:33:08.916 --> 01:33:10.665
But you can't cheat life.

01:33:11.125 --> 01:33:13.040
I got life for two heads.

01:33:13.708 --> 01:33:15.582
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

01:33:16.958 --> 01:33:18.999
- You got scared?
- Yes, sir.

01:33:19.083 --> 01:33:20.790
Answer me.
You got scared?

01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:24.707
Don't be scared
when it's bad.

01:33:24.791 --> 01:33:26.999
Be scared when it's all good.

01:33:28.291 --> 01:33:30.957
'Cause it means
something will fuck up real soon.

01:33:32.083 --> 01:33:33.749
Will you remember this?

01:33:34.666 --> 01:33:36.582
How was it outside?

01:33:36.666 --> 01:33:38.290
Have you fucked lately?

01:33:40.541 --> 01:33:42.249
For sure you got some.

01:33:43.125 --> 01:33:44.665
Got any pics?

01:33:46.958 --> 01:33:49.415
For sure you do.
Everyone does.

01:33:50.083 --> 01:33:51.665
Do you have some?

01:33:52.166 --> 01:33:54.332
Not at the moment,

01:33:54.708 --> 01:33:56.582
but my lady is hot as fuck.

01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.582
Big boobs.
Jamaican style ass.

01:34:00.458 --> 01:34:03.749
Freaking crazy.
You can go balls deep in this one.

01:34:04.208 --> 01:34:06.082
You're missing something?

01:34:12.666 --> 01:34:14.457
- You.
- I'm serious.

01:34:19.458 --> 01:34:21.874
I've got money
from the album.

01:34:21.958 --> 01:34:23.540
I can buy everything.

01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:25.957
That's good.

01:34:26.375 --> 01:34:28.124
Almost everything.

01:34:31.708 --> 01:34:33.624
- Monika...
- Tomek.

01:34:35.291 --> 01:34:36.874
I came here as a doctor.

01:34:37.333 --> 01:34:39.124
I really want to help you out.

01:34:45.958 --> 01:34:48.290
- You want to help me?
- Yes.

01:34:49.875 --> 01:34:51.249
Yes.

01:34:52.791 --> 01:34:55.790
I'm a normal guy,
not some thug.

01:34:56.250 --> 01:34:57.665
So...

01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:02.082
I'll be on parole soon.

01:35:03.583 --> 01:35:04.665
Tomek.

01:35:05.125 --> 01:35:06.957
It cannot be like that.

01:35:07.041 --> 01:35:09.249
It's unprofessional.

01:35:10.625 --> 01:35:13.249
- Do you get that?
- I've got only you.

01:35:19.375 --> 01:35:20.874
Give me a chance.

01:35:25.083 --> 01:35:26.832
That's a chance.

01:35:26.916 --> 01:35:28.582
That was a chance.

01:35:33.166 --> 01:35:36.207
I've just come out
of a relationship.

01:35:36.291 --> 01:35:38.082
We don't know each other.

01:35:38.166 --> 01:35:39.749
Stop talking bullshit.

01:35:40.375 --> 01:35:42.124
That was nice.
Really smooth.

01:35:42.208 --> 01:35:43.665
Time's up.

01:35:43.750 --> 01:35:45.249
Congratz.

01:35:54.125 --> 01:35:56.082
She's really smoking, man.

01:36:21.208 --> 01:36:22.790
Faster.

01:36:25.625 --> 01:36:27.124
Almost shit it out.

01:36:28.041 --> 01:36:29.499
Joking.

01:36:30.416 --> 01:36:32.124
Take it.

01:36:32.750 --> 01:36:35.040
Go over there,
don't get caught.

01:36:47.333 --> 01:36:48.749
Give me some.

01:36:49.083 --> 01:36:50.707
Leave me some, fuck.

01:36:52.916 --> 01:36:54.790
You lost your fucking mind?

01:36:54.875 --> 01:36:56.665
What the fuck are you doing?

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.415
Sit down, you crazy shit.

01:37:08.416 --> 01:37:11.290
I don't fucking believe it.

01:37:15.291 --> 01:37:17.915
They ask in Russia in the 60s,

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.540
what teeth would you like to have?

01:37:20.625 --> 01:37:22.707
The first says: golden, of course.

01:37:22.791 --> 01:37:25.332
The second says: silver ones.

01:37:25.416 --> 01:37:27.665
- And the third one...
- Made of jeans.

01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:29.582
Will you give us a sec?

01:37:35.416 --> 01:37:38.124
That's your crib
for next month.

01:37:39.541 --> 01:37:41.874
Chief banned your visits.

01:37:42.333 --> 01:37:44.249
Was it worth it?

01:37:48.833 --> 01:37:50.790
Did someone show up?

01:37:50.875 --> 01:37:53.040
From those
who I'd put up on a list?

01:37:53.125 --> 01:37:55.082
Who's there? Your mum.

01:37:55.166 --> 01:37:57.665
Mr Krok and Monika Szadek.

01:37:59.583 --> 01:38:01.332
She came.

01:38:06.375 --> 01:38:08.540
Do I have a chance
for parole?

01:38:09.041 --> 01:38:11.624
- After what you did?
- I fucking lost it.

01:38:12.583 --> 01:38:14.332
You need to earn it.

01:38:16.875 --> 01:38:18.790
Take this to kill the time.

01:38:23.833 --> 01:38:25.290
We're ready.

01:38:49.416 --> 01:38:51.040
Tomek.

01:38:51.125 --> 01:38:53.124
A table tennis contest is coming.

01:38:53.625 --> 01:38:56.374
You can win a nice prize.

01:38:56.458 --> 01:38:58.415
I don't know how to play.

01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:00.207
So teach yourself.

01:39:02.416 --> 01:39:04.124
I need to talk.

01:39:04.208 --> 01:39:05.957
Past is past.

01:39:09.250 --> 01:39:11.290
I heard about the contest.

01:39:12.250 --> 01:39:13.874
I don't follow.

01:39:15.208 --> 01:39:16.915
What you want for losing?

01:39:20.833 --> 01:39:23.665
- Full set?
- Exactly what you fucking wanted.

01:39:23.750 --> 01:39:25.540
I'll open a fucking library.

01:40:05.833 --> 01:40:08.499
Management decided to award you

01:40:08.583 --> 01:40:11.957
for your sport spirit
and setting a good example.

01:40:13.375 --> 01:40:16.249
You're getting a ticket to the theatre.

01:40:19.750 --> 01:40:21.332
I'd advise you to go.

01:40:23.250 --> 01:40:25.707
It's financed by our sponsor.

01:40:26.083 --> 01:40:27.707
There'll be food and drinks.

01:40:30.750 --> 01:40:33.499
This prize is a fucking joke.

01:40:33.583 --> 01:40:35.415
Did you play by the rules?

01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:37.540
You made a joke out of it.

01:40:39.375 --> 01:40:42.207
You want a ticket
for your girl or not?

01:40:48.333 --> 01:40:49.999
Behave.

01:40:55.291 --> 01:40:57.874
Looks good, gentlemen.

01:40:57.958 --> 01:40:59.290
Do your job.

01:40:59.375 --> 01:41:00.957
Take your positions.

01:41:02.041 --> 01:41:03.624
And we're ready.

01:41:14.666 --> 01:41:16.332
I don't care what they say.

01:41:17.166 --> 01:41:18.832
You're saving me

01:41:19.250 --> 01:41:21.832
from losing it completely.

01:41:22.791 --> 01:41:25.874
You're a woman that...

01:41:27.583 --> 01:41:29.415
I want to satisfy you.

01:41:31.291 --> 01:41:34.082
My angel
with the divine body.

01:41:35.416 --> 01:41:37.082
Idiot.

01:41:37.166 --> 01:41:38.749
Tomek.

01:41:40.666 --> 01:41:42.082
Tomek.

01:41:47.625 --> 01:41:49.290
We gotta go, gentlemen.

01:41:52.208 --> 01:41:53.832
High time.

01:41:54.250 --> 01:41:55.624
Monika.

01:41:57.083 --> 01:41:58.582
You go first.

01:42:03.750 --> 01:42:05.249
Time to go, gentlemen.

01:42:05.333 --> 01:42:07.624
You'll finish during the break.

01:42:07.708 --> 01:42:09.374
One last bite.

01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:13.082
Enough, gentlemen.

01:42:13.375 --> 01:42:14.832
Time to go.

01:42:16.875 --> 01:42:18.290
All right.

01:42:18.375 --> 01:42:19.790
Come on.

01:42:22.833 --> 01:42:24.124
Upstairs?

01:42:26.875 --> 01:42:28.207
Over here.

01:42:29.125 --> 01:42:32.249
- Who's watching who?
- Sorry.

01:42:33.958 --> 01:42:36.540
Nothing like Christmas at home.

01:42:36.625 --> 01:42:38.457
WARSAW, 2013

01:42:38.541 --> 01:42:40.540
Merry Christmas, Chada.

01:42:42.416 --> 01:42:44.290
4-8, open the gate.

01:42:50.291 --> 01:42:51.665
Tomek.

01:42:52.708 --> 01:42:56.957
I'll wish you a happy new year
when you're back on December, 30th.

01:42:57.916 --> 01:43:00.957
That's the latest collection,
it's very expensive.

01:43:01.041 --> 01:43:03.290
- I'll take two.
- Merry Christmas.

01:43:03.375 --> 01:43:05.082
- Same to you.
- That's all.

01:43:05.375 --> 01:43:07.249
I'll pay with cash.

01:43:17.375 --> 01:43:19.957
Can I see a smile?

01:43:22.833 --> 01:43:24.540
That's the best gift.

01:43:29.291 --> 01:43:31.165
It's more than enough.

01:43:31.250 --> 01:43:33.624
Rest is for you to get a cab

01:43:34.791 --> 01:43:36.499
and here's a bag for you.

01:43:36.583 --> 01:43:38.707
- I can't...
- Merry Christmas.

01:44:18.333 --> 01:44:20.082
Shall we start?

01:44:22.958 --> 01:44:24.957
- Take this.
- Sorry.

01:44:32.166 --> 01:44:33.415
Finally.

01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:35.832
Ho, ho, ho!

01:44:35.916 --> 01:44:38.165
Were you good this year?

01:44:38.583 --> 01:44:41.207
- Good morning.
- Good morning... evening.

01:44:41.833 --> 01:44:44.665
Evening!
What a firm ass!

01:44:46.208 --> 01:44:48.832
Like a teenager.
I've brought something...

01:44:49.791 --> 01:44:51.999
A tie and a flask.

01:44:52.083 --> 01:44:53.790
A tie?
Thank you very much.

01:44:53.875 --> 01:44:57.249
For you, I've got a purse

01:44:57.541 --> 01:45:00.082
and perfumes.
Here you go.

01:45:00.750 --> 01:45:03.832
And for you, I've got cash.

01:45:04.416 --> 01:45:08.249
Careful.
You can get whatever you like.

01:45:08.833 --> 01:45:10.999
Fuck. Sorry.

01:45:11.083 --> 01:45:15.040
A tie for the lady,
a purse for the gentleman.

01:45:15.125 --> 01:45:16.999
And perfumes as well.

01:45:17.083 --> 01:45:20.249
Don't get nervous.

01:45:20.333 --> 01:45:23.415
No need to...

01:45:23.500 --> 01:45:25.249
Good dog.

01:45:32.083 --> 01:45:33.874
Come on.

01:45:34.708 --> 01:45:36.165
Come with me.

01:45:56.625 --> 01:45:58.374
Show me what you can do.

01:46:11.333 --> 01:46:13.665
You need to know
how to chop wood.

01:46:26.916 --> 01:46:28.915
I heard that you like cars.

01:46:29.416 --> 01:46:33.082
Yeah, since I was a kid.

01:46:33.791 --> 01:46:35.124
Really?

01:46:38.458 --> 01:46:40.582
How many have you stolen?

01:46:48.541 --> 01:46:50.165
How old are you?

01:46:50.750 --> 01:46:52.249
36.

01:46:52.333 --> 01:46:54.082
And yet you look 46.

01:46:57.583 --> 01:46:59.124
I'd rather

01:46:59.208 --> 01:47:01.540
have my daughter
date someone her age.

01:47:02.750 --> 01:47:06.082
Someone who has a goal in life.

01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:11.582
What can you offer her?

01:47:13.541 --> 01:47:15.374
You'll leave after Christmas

01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:17.749
and never show up again.

01:47:19.208 --> 01:47:21.999
And I'll make sure
that she forgets you.

01:47:23.625 --> 01:47:25.499
That will be difficult.

01:47:25.583 --> 01:47:26.832
Is that so?

01:47:27.416 --> 01:47:29.374
Cause we're gonna be neighbours.

01:47:31.625 --> 01:47:33.457
LOT FOR SALE

01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:35.457
We'll see about that.

01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.332
Please proceed
to the waiting room.

01:48:01.750 --> 01:48:03.499
Congratulations.

01:48:04.250 --> 01:48:06.665
That's a really good investment.

01:48:07.583 --> 01:48:09.707
I know a lot about investments.

01:48:17.708 --> 01:48:19.332
Don't look.

01:48:34.666 --> 01:48:36.082
Ready?

01:48:52.458 --> 01:48:54.082
There's nothing here.

01:48:55.500 --> 01:48:57.165
But there will be.

01:49:00.541 --> 01:49:02.124
I don't get it.

01:49:03.291 --> 01:49:04.790
I bought it.

01:49:14.708 --> 01:49:16.290
This land?

01:49:21.958 --> 01:49:23.374
Here's a living room.

01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:26.874
Gym on a lower level.

01:49:30.208 --> 01:49:32.082
Here's a room for the baby.

01:49:34.416 --> 01:49:36.624
A couple of meters forward...

01:49:38.708 --> 01:49:40.332
Bathroom.

01:49:41.500 --> 01:49:43.249
With jacuzzi for the lady.

01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:46.999
Kitchen.

01:49:52.083 --> 01:49:53.957
- And the bedroom?
- Stay.

01:49:57.750 --> 01:49:59.374
Right here.

01:50:03.916 --> 01:50:05.582
Let's try it out.

01:50:16.875 --> 01:50:18.624
I left the door opened.

01:50:29.708 --> 01:50:33.249
Report from a place,
from which it is hard to escape

01:50:33.333 --> 01:50:36.540
Where rarely someone
will show you compassion

01:50:36.625 --> 01:50:39.749
It's not picture perfect,
you follow your instincts

01:50:39.833 --> 01:50:42.665
Every day you witness
tragic statistics

01:50:42.750 --> 01:50:46.040
Report from a place,
from which it is hard to escape

01:50:46.125 --> 01:50:49.332
Where rarely someone
will show you compassion

01:50:49.416 --> 01:50:52.457
- It's not...
- Have you lost your fucking mind?

01:50:52.541 --> 01:50:54.707
You didn't report back to prison?!

01:50:54.791 --> 01:50:57.915
Once you do,
they'll lock you for 10 months.

01:51:00.083 --> 01:51:03.374
I'm recording.
Need money for a house.

01:51:03.458 --> 01:51:06.707
And what about live shows?!
And Facebook?

01:51:08.166 --> 01:51:11.457
If you're in prison,
people will forget you.

01:51:11.541 --> 01:51:13.665
They better remember my music.

01:51:13.791 --> 01:51:16.707
It's about your life, man.
Don't you get it?

01:51:19.458 --> 01:51:22.124
Yeah. You're right. I'm lost.

01:51:22.208 --> 01:51:23.874
OK.

01:51:24.500 --> 01:51:26.040
Wait.

01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.707
At least let's make a video.

01:51:33.375 --> 01:51:35.207
Can I finish or we're off?

01:51:36.333 --> 01:51:37.915
Oh man!

01:51:39.500 --> 01:51:41.249
From the top.

01:51:56.583 --> 01:51:58.207
Monika?

01:51:59.416 --> 01:52:01.624
Monika?

01:52:01.708 --> 01:52:03.624
- Yes?
- Where's your Tomek?

01:52:04.208 --> 01:52:07.207
He's recording
and then making a video.

01:52:08.333 --> 01:52:10.374
And you know where he should be?

01:52:16.916 --> 01:52:18.582
I notified the authorities.

01:52:20.416 --> 01:52:22.374
You'll thank me for that.

01:52:23.291 --> 01:52:25.082
You will.

01:52:27.333 --> 01:52:28.915
Are you serious?

01:52:29.125 --> 01:52:31.249
I called the police.

01:52:31.333 --> 01:52:33.040
Are you fucking insane?

01:52:33.125 --> 01:52:34.582
Hey!

01:52:34.666 --> 01:52:36.707
Careful how you speak to your dad.

01:52:36.791 --> 01:52:38.749
You're not in the army.

01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:40.499
She should...

01:52:41.083 --> 01:52:43.124
You see?
That's his fault.

01:52:45.083 --> 01:52:46.499
You're not going anywhere.

01:52:47.458 --> 01:52:48.874
My dear daughter.

01:52:50.750 --> 01:52:52.290
Police are on their way.

01:53:07.125 --> 01:53:09.249
Hi, get out.

01:53:09.916 --> 01:53:12.582
It's a nice place for a video, right?

01:53:13.375 --> 01:53:14.957
Come on in.

01:53:15.041 --> 01:53:18.332
- What the fuck are you doing here?
- You'll talk later.

01:53:18.416 --> 01:53:20.290
Wait a sec.

01:53:20.541 --> 01:53:22.290
Still driving that Passat?

01:53:22.375 --> 01:53:25.249
And you're still stealing cars?

01:53:25.333 --> 01:53:26.665
High five!

01:53:27.500 --> 01:53:28.999
What's new?

01:53:29.083 --> 01:53:32.082
We've raised some cash.
It's for you.

01:53:32.416 --> 01:53:35.707
- For a new ride.
- Come on, man.

01:53:36.250 --> 01:53:38.540
Thank you, girls.

01:53:38.625 --> 01:53:40.915
Tomek, take your spot.

01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:43.290
Let's start this shit.

01:53:43.375 --> 01:53:45.374
We'll look at the camera.

01:53:45.708 --> 01:53:48.124
Play music.

01:53:52.208 --> 01:53:54.499
Respect for my crew,
we never lose hope

01:53:54.791 --> 01:53:57.332
Everyone plays his role
and no one snitches

01:53:57.416 --> 01:54:00.040
Police went crazy,
they threatened my lady

01:54:00.125 --> 01:54:02.999
You won't find me
until I decide to show up

01:54:03.083 --> 01:54:05.374
Chada is here again,
you have my word

01:54:05.666 --> 01:54:08.457
- Cheesecake anyone?
- Sure he's not around?

01:54:08.958 --> 01:54:11.124
Let's make one thing clear.

01:54:11.208 --> 01:54:12.499
One sec.

01:54:12.583 --> 01:54:15.749
Tell guys to bring DA warrant.

01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.332
I'm afraid
we're gonna make a mess.

01:54:18.416 --> 01:54:20.832
Is it necessary?
My daughter made it clear.

01:54:20.916 --> 01:54:23.915
- He's not here.
- People tell us many things.

01:54:24.750 --> 01:54:28.207
Different things.
Maybe we'll find some stolen goods.

01:54:28.791 --> 01:54:31.040
What are you suggesting?

01:54:32.083 --> 01:54:33.749
I know people

01:54:33.833 --> 01:54:36.207
- in the army.
- Oh, really?

01:54:36.291 --> 01:54:38.457
- People in high places.
- Exactly.

01:54:39.250 --> 01:54:40.957
Hi.

01:54:41.750 --> 01:54:43.415
Krok!

01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:45.332
Crowd artists are here.

01:54:45.416 --> 01:54:46.832
Extras.

01:54:50.291 --> 01:54:51.915
I brought extras.

01:54:52.583 --> 01:54:53.874
What?

01:54:54.375 --> 01:54:57.290
- How did you find them?
- I hung posters.

01:54:57.750 --> 01:54:59.374
What were they saying?

01:54:59.833 --> 01:55:03.457
Who told you?
Who, the fuck?

01:55:03.541 --> 01:55:05.624
Fucking idiot.
Cops are coming.

01:55:05.708 --> 01:55:07.665
There's no time.

01:55:10.583 --> 01:55:12.290
Police are on their way.

01:55:12.375 --> 01:55:14.415
Where is he?
Tomek?

01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:16.415
Come on.

01:55:20.166 --> 01:55:21.540
Police are coming.

01:55:21.916 --> 01:55:23.790
Take my bike.
It'll be faster.

01:55:27.458 --> 01:55:28.832
Come on.

01:55:45.250 --> 01:55:47.499
Careful with the clutch.

01:55:54.833 --> 01:55:56.624
You're running this place?

01:55:57.083 --> 01:55:58.624
Where's Chada?

01:55:59.041 --> 01:56:01.165
Where? In prison.

01:56:08.250 --> 01:56:09.665
Evening.

01:56:12.166 --> 01:56:14.540
Riding in these conditions?

01:56:14.625 --> 01:56:16.040
You know what...

01:56:17.083 --> 01:56:19.915
Wife went into labour.
I'm going to the hospital.

01:56:21.125 --> 01:56:22.457
ID, please.

01:56:30.166 --> 01:56:31.540
One moment.

01:56:31.625 --> 01:56:33.207
I was joking.

01:56:35.583 --> 01:56:37.832
Straight and left at the crossing.

01:56:38.833 --> 01:56:40.457
Then straight again.

01:56:41.541 --> 01:56:44.957
Do you have a smoke?
I got all nervous.

01:56:45.541 --> 01:56:47.082
Take a puff.

01:56:47.916 --> 01:56:49.915
One more?

01:56:50.916 --> 01:56:52.124
It'll be a boy.

01:57:16.833 --> 01:57:18.624
Dad, it's for you.

01:57:26.875 --> 01:57:28.415
Wonderful.

01:57:29.250 --> 01:57:32.832
- Maybe you'll get a raise.
- Can you move a little?

01:57:32.916 --> 01:57:34.415
Sure.

01:57:34.500 --> 01:57:36.707
48,50.

01:57:37.041 --> 01:57:39.207
- Cash or card?
- Card.

01:57:39.291 --> 01:57:41.082
Whenever you're ready.

01:57:41.750 --> 01:57:43.749
One moment.
Still processing.

01:57:43.833 --> 01:57:45.290
One more second.

01:57:45.500 --> 01:57:47.165
Accepted.

01:57:47.458 --> 01:57:48.790
Member points?

01:57:48.875 --> 01:57:51.082
- No.
- You want to become a member?

01:57:51.750 --> 01:57:53.415
Thanks.
Throw it away?

01:57:53.500 --> 01:57:54.999
Yes, please.

01:57:56.458 --> 01:57:58.874
- You want a receipt?
- No.

01:57:59.500 --> 01:58:00.915
Thank you.

01:58:02.166 --> 01:58:03.832
Vodka.

01:58:06.375 --> 01:58:07.999
Goodbye.

01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:37.999
- Who's calling?
- Unknown number.

01:58:38.083 --> 01:58:39.665
Answer it.

01:58:43.833 --> 01:58:45.374
Halo?

01:58:46.500 --> 01:58:47.999
I love you.

01:58:49.208 --> 01:58:50.624
That's all.

01:58:53.208 --> 01:58:54.707
Wrong number.

01:58:54.791 --> 01:58:56.874
Let technicians track him down.

01:59:04.416 --> 01:59:06.999
Take it home.
Might be useful.

01:59:07.083 --> 01:59:08.790
No, thank you.

01:59:18.666 --> 01:59:20.999
Where's the bathroom?

01:59:21.625 --> 01:59:23.665
- You wanna pee?
- Yes.

01:59:24.333 --> 01:59:26.707
- On the right.
- Thank you.

01:59:29.166 --> 01:59:31.040
There's no toilet paper.

01:59:48.125 --> 01:59:50.874
You want it or not,
you're moving forward

01:59:50.958 --> 01:59:53.624
The time has come
to accept the truth

01:59:53.708 --> 01:59:56.332
Take a deep breath
and stand on the edge

01:59:56.416 --> 01:59:59.124
There's no more certain
way to die

01:59:59.208 --> 02:00:01.790
It's like dancing
with your fucking enemy

02:00:01.875 --> 02:00:04.499
Often someone trips you over

02:00:04.583 --> 02:00:07.207
I've got my reasons
and that's the reason why

02:00:07.291 --> 02:00:09.999
I'll take our secrets
to the grave, guys

02:00:10.083 --> 02:00:12.707
And even if I'm drowning
in the worst sewage

02:00:12.791 --> 02:00:15.415
Don't judge me,
God will do it better

02:00:15.500 --> 02:00:17.832
I'm ready
and will face it

02:00:18.166 --> 02:00:20.749
I'll help you out,
if only you call me

02:00:21.083 --> 02:00:23.790
If you forget,
then you're dead

02:00:34.083 --> 02:00:36.540
Freeze!

02:00:39.916 --> 02:00:43.207
With this ID number,
you'd make a career in here.

02:00:43.291 --> 02:00:45.249
911.

02:00:48.250 --> 02:00:49.749
Look at me.

02:00:50.416 --> 02:00:51.874
Look at me.

02:00:54.041 --> 02:00:55.457
Second name.

02:00:57.500 --> 02:00:59.040
Piotr.

02:00:59.583 --> 02:01:01.874
You remember
your whole ID number?

02:01:05.541 --> 02:01:06.957
I'm listening.

02:01:09.083 --> 02:01:10.374
Number.

02:01:10.458 --> 02:01:14.415
83-06-100-911. Call me.

02:01:17.500 --> 02:01:20.332
We've got time.
Not so sure about you.

02:01:21.500 --> 02:01:23.124
Parents name.

02:01:24.500 --> 02:01:25.915
Maria and Jan.

02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:27.499
Relax.

02:01:29.750 --> 02:01:31.415
I'm relaxed.

02:01:33.041 --> 02:01:35.665
- What's up?
- Junk.

02:01:36.375 --> 02:01:38.707
Fucking European inventions.

02:01:38.958 --> 02:01:40.915
Why you're laughing at?

02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.124
At the handsome man
in the photo.

02:01:46.750 --> 02:01:48.165
What photo?

02:01:48.250 --> 02:01:50.707
That one.
Turn around.

02:01:55.750 --> 02:01:57.999
Damn it.

02:01:59.375 --> 02:02:01.040
Little fucker.

02:02:01.833 --> 02:02:03.165
What now?

02:02:03.250 --> 02:02:05.207
Shall we notify Warsaw?

02:02:05.833 --> 02:02:07.374
Wait.

02:02:10.250 --> 02:02:12.332
You fucking clown.

02:02:12.416 --> 02:02:15.540
You think you can come here
and get buck?

02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.499
Make fun of the force?

02:02:21.625 --> 02:02:23.374
We've had many like you.

02:02:23.875 --> 02:02:26.999
- No doubt.
- What's more, it's up to me

02:02:27.416 --> 02:02:30.457
when and in what shape
you'll go to Warsaw.

02:02:32.166 --> 02:02:33.624
You know what?

02:02:34.750 --> 02:02:36.290
You look familiar.

02:02:38.625 --> 02:02:40.249
Pamela.

02:02:41.500 --> 02:02:43.082
You'll be his Pamela.

02:02:45.250 --> 02:02:46.749
Come on.

02:02:46.833 --> 02:02:48.582
You know what he does to her?

02:02:50.875 --> 02:02:52.165
Fuck!

02:02:56.833 --> 02:02:58.874
Who gave you a black eye?

02:02:58.958 --> 02:03:00.624
I stepped on a broom.

02:03:00.875 --> 02:03:02.707
Careful not to get
another one.

02:03:03.250 --> 02:03:06.540
Cause of your stunts,
no one gets to leave.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:18.332
No doubt that I love you,
no matter what

02:03:18.416 --> 02:03:21.624
Only you can save me
from going insane

02:03:21.708 --> 02:03:24.457
OPOLE, 2016

02:03:28.416 --> 02:03:31.749
No doubt that I love you,
no matter what

02:03:31.833 --> 02:03:35.124
Only you can save me
from going insane

02:03:35.208 --> 02:03:38.457
Glad that I have you
and get to walk by your side

02:03:38.541 --> 02:03:41.999
I had my heart broken before
and it hurt real bad

02:03:42.083 --> 02:03:45.290
You give me strength
and I won't lose faith

02:03:45.375 --> 02:03:48.624
In this rotten world.
You're like a refreshing bath

02:03:48.708 --> 02:03:52.124
I try to take care of you,
just like you took care of me

02:03:52.208 --> 02:03:54.290
I'm taking you there.

02:03:55.791 --> 02:03:57.374
Nice, huh?

02:04:01.250 --> 02:04:03.832
Can you put me against the wall?

02:04:03.916 --> 02:04:05.915
It seems uneven.

02:04:06.291 --> 02:04:07.665
Here?

02:04:12.166 --> 02:04:14.207
- It's big, isn't it?
- Yeah.

02:04:18.416 --> 02:04:20.249
We'll get by.

02:04:27.375 --> 02:04:28.832
Right?

02:04:34.458 --> 02:04:36.249
Why did you zone out?

02:04:37.958 --> 02:04:39.457
What's on your mind?

02:04:41.250 --> 02:04:43.124
Plenty of things.

02:04:44.458 --> 02:04:46.290
What will you do?

02:04:46.375 --> 02:04:49.374
You'll go out tomorrow,
lead normal life.

02:04:55.583 --> 02:04:57.040
I'll get married.

02:04:58.041 --> 02:04:59.790
Fucker.

02:05:01.416 --> 02:05:02.999
I wanna find my mother.

02:05:05.041 --> 02:05:06.374
You will.

02:05:09.083 --> 02:05:10.499
I believe in that.

02:05:10.791 --> 02:05:13.290
I wanna live a normal life.
No screw ups.

02:05:17.125 --> 02:05:18.999
I'm rooting for you.

02:05:28.833 --> 02:05:30.749
- Limpy?
- Yes.

02:05:30.833 --> 02:05:33.540
- Get the fuck out.
- One sec.

02:05:36.833 --> 02:05:39.082
Get the fuck out.

02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:49.415
Chada.

02:05:50.916 --> 02:05:52.249
What?

02:05:53.708 --> 02:05:55.249
Łysa says "hi".

02:05:55.750 --> 02:05:57.290
Time has come.

02:06:00.250 --> 02:06:02.165
We need to remove the floor.

02:06:02.250 --> 02:06:05.124
It was done
many decades ago.

02:06:07.666 --> 02:06:10.165
We need new tiles.

02:06:10.250 --> 02:06:12.207
These are almost ancient.

02:06:17.916 --> 02:06:19.915
Chada, Chada!

02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:21.540
WARSAW 2017

02:06:21.625 --> 02:06:23.582
4-8, open the gate.

02:06:25.083 --> 02:06:27.457
Hope that's it, Chada.

02:06:35.791 --> 02:06:37.957
Give me a sec.

02:06:41.375 --> 02:06:43.165
Chada, Chada!

02:06:55.625 --> 02:06:57.707
- What's your name?
- Weronika.

02:07:01.875 --> 02:07:03.665
Hi, everyone.

02:07:03.750 --> 02:07:05.374
On this chilly day,

02:07:05.458 --> 02:07:07.499
it's below 10,

02:07:07.708 --> 02:07:10.040
but we're happy and smiling.

02:07:10.500 --> 02:07:13.290
Erikson has even put
the gel in his hair.

02:07:13.791 --> 02:07:17.374
We're hitting the road today,
starting on a high note.

02:07:17.625 --> 02:07:19.374
We're supporting...

02:07:19.458 --> 02:07:21.374
The Game.

02:07:23.708 --> 02:07:25.290
Got it?

02:07:25.375 --> 02:07:27.499
- Got it.
- Great.

02:07:45.041 --> 02:07:46.874
What's going on?

02:07:46.958 --> 02:07:48.415
Everything's fine.

02:07:49.916 --> 02:07:52.415
Everything's fallen into place.

02:07:54.041 --> 02:07:55.624
Let's go.

02:07:55.875 --> 02:07:57.540
It's fine.

02:08:03.083 --> 02:08:05.374
- Thank you!
- Can we take a picture?

02:08:05.458 --> 02:08:08.790
After the show.

02:08:09.666 --> 02:08:11.832
- See you later.
- Take care, Chada!

02:08:12.083 --> 02:08:13.707
Good morning, Mr Chada.

02:08:13.791 --> 02:08:16.665
We're honoured
to have you as a guest.

02:08:16.750 --> 02:08:19.665
Please follow me.
Your room is ready.

02:08:20.000 --> 02:08:22.415
Bellhop will take care
of your luggage.

02:08:23.125 --> 02:08:25.540
I hope you'll be satisfied.

02:08:26.375 --> 02:08:28.040
Over there.

02:09:13.625 --> 02:09:15.165
Halo?

02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:17.457
Hi, mum.

02:09:20.583 --> 02:09:22.040
Yes?

02:09:24.083 --> 02:09:25.665
Yes, ok.

02:09:25.750 --> 02:09:27.124
Try to calm down.

02:09:28.416 --> 02:09:30.290
Stop yelling. Ok.

02:09:31.041 --> 02:09:33.040
It's almost 300 km.

02:09:36.750 --> 02:09:38.124
Ok.

02:09:39.583 --> 02:09:40.957
Ok, stop...

02:09:47.958 --> 02:09:50.040
- I'm sorry.
- Don't leave me now.

02:09:50.583 --> 02:09:52.415
- I'll be back.
- Not now.

02:09:52.500 --> 02:09:53.707
I'll be back.

02:09:54.625 --> 02:09:56.249
You gonna miss the show.

02:09:57.958 --> 02:09:59.374
I'll see others.

02:10:09.166 --> 02:10:11.082
Can we take a shower together?

02:10:12.208 --> 02:10:13.665
Make it quick.

02:10:20.000 --> 02:10:21.499
Quick.

02:10:21.833 --> 02:10:23.332
Can we do an interview?

02:10:24.083 --> 02:10:26.124
One moment. Tomasz!

02:10:27.375 --> 02:10:28.624
Look.

02:10:37.791 --> 02:10:38.999
Halo?

02:10:43.291 --> 02:10:44.665
Hi, mum.

02:10:48.333 --> 02:10:50.040
You'll be back next week?

02:10:53.375 --> 02:10:54.957
I'll pick you up.

02:10:58.416 --> 02:11:00.040
I love you very much, mum.

02:11:02.708 --> 02:11:04.499
Bye.

02:11:07.291 --> 02:11:08.874
Can we talk now?

02:11:08.958 --> 02:11:10.415
All good?

02:11:11.250 --> 02:11:12.832
Sorry?

02:11:14.458 --> 02:11:16.749
- Are you sure?
- Can we?

02:11:17.166 --> 02:11:20.165
After the show, dolly.

02:11:22.333 --> 02:11:24.957
Good luck, bro.

02:11:26.666 --> 02:11:28.082
Ready?

02:11:45.666 --> 02:11:48.457
I have nothing to add,
I feel this vibe

02:11:48.541 --> 02:11:51.665
Don't know any other.
What should I rap about?

02:11:57.250 --> 02:12:00.249
I have nothing to add,
I feel this vibe

02:12:00.333 --> 02:12:03.332
Don't know any other.
What should I rap about?

02:14:39.000 --> 02:14:41.165
TOMASZ CHADA DIED ON 18 MARCH 2018
