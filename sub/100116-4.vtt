00:01.501 --> 00:04.137
Previously on Legacies...
You don't want me to point out

00:04.137 --> 00:05.672
that you've been
consumed by Malivore?

00:05.672 --> 00:07.741
That the big bad
lived to see another day

00:07.741 --> 00:11.812
and all your friends have
forgotten you ever existed?

00:11.812 --> 00:12.813
I have absolutely no idea

00:12.813 --> 00:14.381
what to do next.

00:14.381 --> 00:15.415
Why have you stopped
using your magic?

00:15.415 --> 00:16.550
Tenebris lapsus.

00:16.550 --> 00:18.318
(bone cracks, Ethan shouts)

00:19.286 --> 00:20.287
(whispering):
I hurt someone.

00:20.287 --> 00:21.588
I think I wanted to.

00:21.588 --> 00:23.290
I'm hunting bigger game
this year.

00:23.290 --> 00:25.559
That Sebastian dude
you're crushing on?

00:25.559 --> 00:27.761
LIZZIE: He doesn't know
anything about me.

00:29.763 --> 00:31.131
Raf has been stuck in wolf form

00:31.131 --> 00:32.533
ever since you've been gone.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.801
Raf. Look, I-I know
you don't remember me,

00:34.801 --> 00:36.803
but I can help you.

00:36.803 --> 00:38.238
I thought you
were gone.

00:38.238 --> 00:39.573
Who was that girl?

00:59.426 --> 01:01.361
(metal ringing softly)

01:11.204 --> 01:13.740
(growling)

01:34.761 --> 01:37.297
(growls)

01:40.334 --> 01:42.402
(yelling)

01:45.806 --> 01:47.808
(growling)

01:52.245 --> 01:55.382
(grunting)

01:56.650 --> 01:58.585
(straining)

02:02.189 --> 02:04.358
(screaming)

02:07.194 --> 02:09.329
(bell tolls)

02:13.800 --> 02:16.269
Hey, man.

02:16.269 --> 02:17.704
Are you okay?

02:21.508 --> 02:22.342
(gasps)

02:22.342 --> 02:24.811
(panting)

02:27.814 --> 02:29.282
Whoa, buddy.
Hey!

02:39.359 --> 02:41.528
(pleading in Japanese)

02:45.532 --> 02:47.634
(pleading in Japanese)

02:52.000 --> 02:54.670
ALARIC (over P.A.):
Hope Marshall to
the principal's office.

02:54.670 --> 02:56.810
(school bell ringing)

02:56.810 --> 02:59.840
P.A. system? It's a little
dramatic, don't you think?

02:59.840 --> 03:01.710
Not as dramatic as
the message Landon left me,

03:01.710 --> 03:03.680
saying he had
something urgent to discuss.

03:05.180 --> 03:07.280
Anything you want to share?
Only that

03:07.280 --> 03:10.020
I'm pretty sure the monsters
are after him this time.

03:10.020 --> 03:11.890
And you didn't think that
that's something I should know?

03:11.890 --> 03:13.590
More like I was afraid

03:13.590 --> 03:15.220
of what you were
gonna say after that.

03:15.220 --> 03:17.830
Hope. (sighs)

03:17.830 --> 03:20.060
You need to go back
to the Salvatore School.

03:20.060 --> 03:21.560
That was it.

03:21.560 --> 03:23.900
Not for your sake.
For theirs.

03:23.900 --> 03:27.240
Maybe Landon isn't
that important to you.

03:27.240 --> 03:30.640
But if Malivore wants him,
we need to want him more.

03:30.640 --> 03:33.680
Look, I will take care of it,
but from a distance.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.940
Okay, what am I
missing here, Hope? Hmm?

03:35.940 --> 03:39.680
You told me the truth,
and everything worked out fine.

03:39.680 --> 03:41.950
Not the whole truth.

03:41.950 --> 03:44.290
Hmm.

03:44.290 --> 03:47.290
Landon and I...

03:47.290 --> 03:48.990
we were in love.

03:50.290 --> 03:52.590
(chuckles):
Like, real love.

03:52.590 --> 03:54.930
Epic love, if that even exists.

03:54.930 --> 03:58.100
I can assure you it does.

03:58.100 --> 03:59.170
Now he's with Josie,

03:59.170 --> 04:03.970
and they don't know
what we were to each other.

04:03.970 --> 04:06.170
And I'm just afraid
that if I tell them,

04:06.170 --> 04:10.280
she's gonna hate me forever
or he's gonna hate me

04:10.280 --> 04:13.210
or I'm gonna hate myself
because I made us all miserable.

04:13.210 --> 04:14.980
So I can't tell them.

04:14.980 --> 04:16.220
Not yet.

04:16.220 --> 04:18.090
(knock on door)

04:18.090 --> 04:19.920
Sorry to interrupt.
No, it's okay.

04:19.920 --> 04:22.220
I was just leaving.
I will see you at the pep rally.

04:22.220 --> 04:23.730
See you there.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.160
I hope you consider
the transfer.

04:25.160 --> 04:28.260
I can put in a good word for you
at the Salvatore School.

04:30.300 --> 04:32.230
Actually,

04:32.230 --> 04:35.700
you're no longer allowed within
a hundred feet of its grounds.

04:35.700 --> 04:37.840
What?

04:43.210 --> 04:46.820
"Notice of Court Hearing and
Temporary Restraining Order"?

04:51.350 --> 04:53.020
(slow knocking)

04:53.020 --> 04:54.420
I'm not feeling well, sorry.

04:54.420 --> 04:57.130
VARDEMUS:
I'm sorry to hear
you're unwell.

05:03.800 --> 05:06.030
You shouldn't be surprised.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.270
You gave me that black magic
spell, and because of it,

05:12.270 --> 05:15.980
I broke that kid's arm, and
mine's not doing so hot either.

05:17.280 --> 05:19.880
What did your father
have to say about this?

05:19.880 --> 05:23.690
I-I haven't had the chance
to ask him yet.

05:23.690 --> 05:26.420
That's understandable.

05:26.420 --> 05:27.890
He was busy
starting brawls.

05:27.890 --> 05:30.760
I'm pretty sure that was
your fault, too.

05:32.030 --> 05:34.730
I may have something that can
help that rash of yours.

05:34.730 --> 05:36.200
I've had enough
of your help.

05:36.200 --> 05:39.900
I cast that spell, and I'm gonna
deal with the consequences.

05:39.900 --> 05:42.040
But I'm never doing
black magic again.

05:43.910 --> 05:46.170
I would urge you
not to limit yourself.

05:46.170 --> 05:47.310
Black magic has

05:47.310 --> 05:49.010
its place in our craft.

05:49.010 --> 05:51.410
My dad always said
the exact opposite.

05:51.410 --> 05:53.050
Of course.

05:55.380 --> 05:57.420
I cannot think
of a single reason

05:57.420 --> 06:02.060
why he would want to limit
your exceptional abilities.

06:04.190 --> 06:07.600
If you ever have
need to talk...

06:11.470 --> 06:13.970
...my door is always open.

06:15.800 --> 06:17.170
(door closes)

06:17.170 --> 06:20.210
I said Renaissance era,
not Renaissance festival.

06:20.210 --> 06:23.850
I can't look like a cosplayer
in front of Sebastian.

06:23.850 --> 06:26.210
We could take in
the sleeve like this.

06:26.210 --> 06:27.250
Don't.

06:28.150 --> 06:29.450
Just fix it.

06:29.450 --> 06:30.990
I spent a lot of time

06:30.990 --> 06:32.920
bettering myself
over the summer,

06:32.920 --> 06:35.290
and I need you all
to rise to my level.

06:35.290 --> 06:36.160
Now.

06:36.160 --> 06:38.160
MG:
How's it going?

06:38.160 --> 06:39.360
Terrible.

06:39.360 --> 06:42.160
I mean, I'm great,
but everyone else,

06:42.160 --> 06:43.830
terrible.

06:43.830 --> 06:45.300
Except for you.

06:45.300 --> 06:46.430
You really tried

06:46.430 --> 06:48.100
to help me with Sebastian.

06:48.100 --> 06:49.100
Thanks.

06:49.100 --> 06:51.240
Yeah, um, about that.

06:51.240 --> 06:55.240
Actually, um, I know
you're all in with this guy, uh,

06:55.240 --> 06:57.850
but I think it might be
best for you to keep

06:57.850 --> 07:00.420
your relationship status
on the DL for a while.

07:00.420 --> 07:01.520
Why would I do that?

07:01.520 --> 07:02.980
It's all so new. (chuckles)

07:02.980 --> 07:06.320
I'm worried you might be
seeing things.

07:06.320 --> 07:09.390
Through rose-colored glasses,
I mean.

07:09.390 --> 07:13.130
MG, I am in the best
emotional shape of my life.

07:13.130 --> 07:15.030
I need to carpe the diem.

07:15.030 --> 07:16.160
Seize the lay.

07:16.160 --> 07:18.300
Oh, wow.
Besides, friends should

07:18.300 --> 07:20.300
support each other.
If I'm happy,

07:20.300 --> 07:21.800
you're happy.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.170
Don't overthink it.

07:25.470 --> 07:27.880
RAFAEL:
You sure we should
be doing this?

07:27.880 --> 07:29.880
If Dr. Saltzman thinks
he can ignore my calls

07:29.880 --> 07:31.150
like we don't live
in the same town,

07:31.150 --> 07:32.550
he's got
another think coming.

07:32.550 --> 07:35.180
Namely monsters, because if
they're back and after me now,

07:35.180 --> 07:36.580
I must've done something
to screw up

07:36.580 --> 07:38.090
the night
the Malivore pit went dry.

07:38.090 --> 07:39.420
And if I can't
remember any of it,

07:39.420 --> 07:41.160
we need his help
to figure out what changed

07:41.160 --> 07:44.490
and how to fix it,
or we're all in danger.

07:44.490 --> 07:46.260
Are you even
listening to me?

07:46.260 --> 07:48.160
Yeah, I'm always listening.

07:48.160 --> 07:49.330
Well, do you speak anymore?

07:49.330 --> 07:51.030
I mean, ever since
you got back to school,

07:51.030 --> 07:52.570
your sentences have averaged
three words each.

07:52.570 --> 07:53.940
That's not true.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.310
That's three words.

07:58.370 --> 08:01.180
Hey, man, watch what you...
(grunts)

08:05.180 --> 08:07.480
Look, I know you say
you're fine, but you were stuck

08:07.480 --> 08:10.590
as a wolf
for a pretty long time.
Yeah, and I'm back now.

08:10.590 --> 08:12.320
So it's all good.

08:12.320 --> 08:13.920
Thanks to Hope.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.060
Yeah, she was pretty incredible.
(chuckles)

08:26.530 --> 08:29.170
So that is why
you came with me.

08:29.170 --> 08:31.910
What?
You just want to
see Hope again?

08:31.910 --> 08:33.340
(sighs)

08:33.340 --> 08:36.310
No. I, um, want to stop these
monsters from getting to you.

08:36.310 --> 08:38.550
And if we see Hope, I mean,
that's-that's cool, too.

08:38.550 --> 08:40.180
(school bell ringing,
students clamoring)

08:40.180 --> 08:41.550
Yeah, it would be cool, too.

08:41.550 --> 08:42.950
(gasps)

08:46.550 --> 08:48.490
Hey, are you okay?

08:48.490 --> 08:51.330
Raf? Raf? Raf?

08:51.330 --> 08:52.960
(Rafael grunts)
MAN: Slow down!

08:52.960 --> 08:55.160
(speaking Japanese)

08:59.930 --> 09:02.070
Dude, I'm gonna
find someone who can

09:02.070 --> 09:03.340
understand you,
but I need to know

09:03.340 --> 09:05.240
you're not gonna go stabbing...
Konichiwa.

09:05.240 --> 09:08.280
(speaking Japanese)

09:08.280 --> 09:11.110
(grunts)
Since when
do you speak Japanese?

09:11.110 --> 09:13.580
Since Lizzie's old
therapist was next to a
Japanese language school.

09:14.620 --> 09:16.280
(speaking Japanese)

09:17.150 --> 09:18.620
(speaking Japanese)

09:18.620 --> 09:20.250
...Kurutta.

09:20.250 --> 09:21.660
Uh...
What's he saying?

09:21.660 --> 09:23.060
He's crazed?

09:23.060 --> 09:24.360
Kurutta.

09:24.360 --> 09:26.060
Oh, I think that's his name.

09:26.060 --> 09:28.100
Also, another word for "crazed."

09:28.100 --> 09:30.260
(speaking Japanese)

09:33.200 --> 09:36.040
He's a... demon hunter?

09:36.040 --> 09:38.410
Looking for an Oni,

09:38.410 --> 09:41.680
which is like a demon-
ghost-monster kind of a thing.

09:41.680 --> 09:44.080
Sounds like that's
our next Malivore monster.

09:44.080 --> 09:46.010
Then the Oni's probably
wherever Landon is.

09:46.010 --> 09:48.020
(speaking Japanese)

09:51.490 --> 09:54.960
Uh, he said he followed
his sword here,

09:54.960 --> 09:57.190
and it glows around...

09:57.190 --> 09:58.730
Jintsu-riki?

09:58.730 --> 10:00.290
Oh, oh, supernaturals.

10:00.290 --> 10:03.230
Okay. Makes sense
why he wound up here.

10:03.230 --> 10:06.030
But I've never
seen one of those.

10:06.030 --> 10:08.170
(speaking Japanese angrily)

10:10.400 --> 10:14.040
He said that we wouldn't know
if the Oni was here or not.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.040
(speaking Japanese)

10:16.040 --> 10:17.710
It possesses people,

10:17.710 --> 10:21.150
and it could be anywhere.

10:22.620 --> 10:25.190
In anyone.

10:25.190 --> 10:27.590
(panting)

10:31.760 --> 10:33.730
Watch yourself, bro.

10:33.730 --> 10:36.260
Go fail chemistry.

10:36.260 --> 10:38.230
Hey.
(school bell ringing)

10:38.230 --> 10:41.540
I shouldn't have asked you
to come with me. We can go.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.070
Raf?

10:45.070 --> 10:46.470
(growling)

10:46.470 --> 10:47.380
Raf.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.640
(growling)
Scalare.

10:53.350 --> 10:55.580
Hope.

10:55.580 --> 10:56.780
(soft groaning)

10:56.780 --> 10:59.750
How are you always in the
right place at the right time?

10:59.750 --> 11:01.320
That's funny.

11:01.320 --> 11:03.590
I was just thinking
the exact opposite thing.

11:13.400 --> 11:15.270
There you are.
I need you.

11:15.270 --> 11:18.410
So you can apologize for this?

11:18.410 --> 11:22.140
Are you seriously using
black magic again?

11:22.140 --> 11:24.250
Allow me to remind you
that whenever you do,

11:24.250 --> 11:25.580
whatever happens to you
happens to me, too.

11:25.580 --> 11:27.750
And I'm so sorry.
It won't happen again.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.380
Well, you're just lucky

11:29.380 --> 11:32.390
that Sebastian appreciates
the old-fashioned look.

11:32.390 --> 11:35.120
(Kurutta shouting in Japanese,
students murmuring)

11:35.120 --> 11:36.360
Um...

11:42.100 --> 11:43.500
Who the hell is that?

11:43.500 --> 11:45.670
JOSIE:
Long story.
Short version?

11:45.670 --> 11:46.700
He is a samurai/demon hunter

11:46.700 --> 11:49.170
who lost his Oni and the
only way we can kill it

11:49.170 --> 11:50.500
is with his
demon-banishing sword

11:50.500 --> 11:52.140
before it carries off
Landon into Malivore.

11:52.140 --> 11:53.270
Can you come?

11:53.270 --> 11:56.340
Well, I suppose
if I reschedule my date,

11:56.340 --> 11:58.350
it would give this rash
some time to clear up.

11:58.350 --> 12:01.080
Ah, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

12:01.080 --> 12:03.650
(chuckling)

12:03.650 --> 12:05.550
(speaking Japanese)

12:08.660 --> 12:10.320
Kurutta.

12:10.320 --> 12:12.290
He's talking about me, isn't he?

12:12.290 --> 12:13.830
He's calling me crazy.
No.

12:13.830 --> 12:15.500
No, he's talking about the Oni.

12:15.500 --> 12:17.430
It possesses people,
makes them act crazy.

12:17.430 --> 12:19.400
Well, then I retract my offer.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.740
My mental health is the most
precious thing that I have, Jo.

12:21.740 --> 12:24.370
A rash I can deal with,

12:24.370 --> 12:26.840
but I cannot risk crazy.
I'm sorry.

12:26.840 --> 12:28.740
(shouting in Japanese)

12:28.740 --> 12:30.240
(students gasping, shouting)

12:30.240 --> 12:32.410
(shouting in Japanese)

12:33.810 --> 12:35.520
(whistle blows, crowd cheering)

12:35.520 --> 12:37.420
MAC:
Thanks for letting me stay.

12:37.420 --> 12:39.690
Last time I asked Maya
what was going on in her life,

12:39.690 --> 12:41.420
she called me a narc.
(chuckles)

12:41.420 --> 12:43.460
Well, I guess that means
you're doing something right.

12:43.460 --> 12:45.530
(chanting):
Here we are...

12:45.530 --> 12:48.400
About that restraining order--

12:48.400 --> 12:50.330
I was just doing my job.

12:51.430 --> 12:52.900
But off the record,
can I be honest?

12:52.900 --> 12:54.470
I wish more people would be.

12:54.470 --> 12:56.770
That headmaster is a dick.

12:59.740 --> 13:02.480
I'm sorry.
Will you give me a moment?

13:04.450 --> 13:06.810
Let's go, Wolves!
(whoops)

13:08.220 --> 13:10.250
(whooping, cheering)

13:10.250 --> 13:12.390
HOPE:
Ad somnum.
(sighs)

13:15.460 --> 13:17.760
What were you two
even doing here?

13:17.760 --> 13:18.890
Looking for answers.

13:18.890 --> 13:21.360
And, I guess... you.

13:23.260 --> 13:25.230
JOSIE:
Dad?
Josie.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.440
What the hell's going on?

13:28.440 --> 13:31.410
(speaks Japanese)

13:31.410 --> 13:33.470
JOSIE: He said,
"We came to protect

13:33.470 --> 13:34.940
the bonsai-headed boy."

13:34.940 --> 13:36.510
I think.

13:40.880 --> 13:43.550
(speaks Japanese)

13:44.650 --> 13:45.790
(grunts)

13:46.790 --> 13:47.620
That's Japanese for,

13:47.620 --> 13:49.590
"What the hell
is she doing here?"

13:50.930 --> 13:52.760
MG:
This is not

13:52.760 --> 13:53.790
what I signed up for.

13:53.790 --> 13:55.330
Sorry, brotato.

13:55.330 --> 13:56.560
AV club members get
equipment priority.

13:56.560 --> 13:59.370
You're the only one
in the AV club, Wes.

13:59.370 --> 14:01.740
It's Wade.
Whatever.

14:01.740 --> 14:05.410
Look, I need to help a friend
with a project.

14:05.410 --> 14:07.480
An important one.
This might be the only way

14:07.480 --> 14:09.740
I could get her
to see the truth.

14:09.740 --> 14:11.480
Cinema verité.

14:11.480 --> 14:12.780
I can dig it.

14:18.520 --> 14:21.220
All this time travel's been hard
on the camera, Bon.

14:21.220 --> 14:22.360
There it is.

14:22.360 --> 14:24.660
(clapping)
KAI: Yay!

14:24.660 --> 14:26.890
This tape is used.
Who cares?

14:26.890 --> 14:29.300
Just record over it.

14:35.840 --> 14:37.970
Just because she's supernatural
doesn't mean we can trust her.

14:37.970 --> 14:39.710
I mean, she shouldn't be here.

14:39.710 --> 14:41.310
ALARIC: Look, I will take
all the help I can get.

14:41.310 --> 14:43.280
Even from him.

14:43.280 --> 14:46.680
So ask him to tell us
everything we should know.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.380
Kurutta-san.

14:54.590 --> 14:57.490
(Kurutta speaking Japanese)

15:05.800 --> 15:07.740
Dropped on his
head as a baby.

15:10.400 --> 15:11.910
Samurai school
to learn discipline.

15:11.910 --> 15:13.640
(Kurutta continues
speaking Japanese)

15:16.940 --> 15:19.510
He learned to slay Oni--

15:19.510 --> 15:22.680
demons, which is
what we're chasing.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.050
(Kurutta shouts
in Japanese)

15:24.050 --> 15:25.350
He was a hero.

15:25.350 --> 15:26.450
(Kurutta speaking Japanese)

15:26.450 --> 15:28.020
All the women begged to...

15:28.020 --> 15:30.760
(both speaking Japanese)

15:30.760 --> 15:32.490
Kurutta-san,
I don't even know that word,

15:32.490 --> 15:33.630
but it cannot be relevant.

15:33.630 --> 15:34.800
ALARIC:
Josie, the point.

15:34.800 --> 15:35.860
Let's get to it.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.570
(speaking Japanese)

15:42.370 --> 15:44.040
(panting)

15:44.040 --> 15:46.510
(Kurutta speaking Japanese)

15:46.510 --> 15:48.840
JOSIE:
Kurutta spent months
tracking down an Oni

15:48.840 --> 15:53.410
that possessed people, moving
from person to person by touch.

15:53.410 --> 15:55.050
He was just about to kill it

15:55.050 --> 15:58.390
when it found its way
into the body of a child

15:58.390 --> 16:01.390
and escaped him yet again.

16:05.660 --> 16:07.530
(Kurutta continues
speaking Japanese)

16:09.930 --> 16:12.400
JOSIE:
He gave chase
and caught the demon.

16:12.400 --> 16:15.670
But he could not bring himself
to harm an innocent child.

16:17.940 --> 16:21.580
So, instead,
he made an impossible choice

16:21.580 --> 16:23.740
and he took the Oni
into himself.

16:25.780 --> 16:28.820
But it was then that he
realized, unlike everyone else

16:28.820 --> 16:31.090
who had been possessed
and remembered nothing,

16:31.090 --> 16:34.490
he was still partly in control
of his faculties.

16:34.490 --> 16:36.460
He thinks the Oni
found it harder

16:36.460 --> 16:38.530
to possess his broken mind.

16:38.530 --> 16:39.860
His words, not mine.

16:39.860 --> 16:42.730
He tried to stab himself
with his sword,

16:42.730 --> 16:44.900
and the Oni wouldn't let him.

16:46.730 --> 16:48.770
JOSIE:
So he decided to

16:48.770 --> 16:52.070
never touch a person again--
(speaks Japanese)

16:52.070 --> 16:53.510
(continues
speaking Japanese)

16:53.510 --> 16:55.580
So that it could never
possess anyone else.

16:55.580 --> 16:57.650
And then...

16:57.650 --> 17:00.810
Malivore, eternity
of nothingness...

17:01.980 --> 17:04.620
...deep psychological torment.

17:04.620 --> 17:06.120
He came through an...

17:06.120 --> 17:07.590
ana.

17:07.590 --> 17:09.520
I think he's talking
about a portal.

17:09.520 --> 17:11.730
Portal? Uh, where?
Uh, sorry,

17:11.730 --> 17:13.590
the ancient samurai
isn't an expert

17:13.590 --> 17:15.100
on Mystic Falls geography.

17:15.100 --> 17:18.130
How do we kill
the... the demon?

17:18.130 --> 17:19.600
Uh, with his sword.

17:19.600 --> 17:21.500
It's spelled with a
special kind of magic,

17:21.500 --> 17:23.100
so if we can just
find the Oni...

17:23.100 --> 17:24.740
(loud banging)

17:24.740 --> 17:26.870
Not a problem.
(roars)

17:29.880 --> 17:31.910
(speaking Japanese)

17:34.580 --> 17:35.920
Wait, no, no, no, no!

17:37.720 --> 17:39.750
Motus.

17:49.430 --> 17:51.570
(speaking Japanese weakly)

17:55.900 --> 17:58.070
He said
that could've gone better.

18:05.150 --> 18:07.510
(crowd cheering, whooping)

18:10.650 --> 18:13.150
Damn. I wonder if Raf
already touched someone.

18:13.150 --> 18:16.060
Yeah, just look for anyone
acting strange or erratic.

18:16.060 --> 18:18.990
(chanting):
Timberwolves! Timberwolves!
Timberwolves!

18:18.990 --> 18:20.190
Timberwolves!

18:20.190 --> 18:22.700
You mean besides
the football team?

18:22.700 --> 18:24.600
There's a student
that needs your help.

18:24.600 --> 18:26.830
(team continues chanting)

18:35.810 --> 18:36.780
Raf?

18:36.780 --> 18:38.080
ALARIC:
Hope, wait.

18:38.080 --> 18:39.080
Don't touch him.

18:39.080 --> 18:40.210
Raf?

18:40.210 --> 18:42.650
Hey.

18:43.820 --> 18:46.550
Oh, yeah, that's you, isn't it?

18:48.490 --> 18:50.160
Yeah.

18:54.230 --> 18:56.830
Um...

18:56.830 --> 18:58.570
I wasn't in control back there.

18:58.570 --> 19:01.170
It's okay.
I-I can help you.

19:01.170 --> 19:02.700
I-I just need to know

19:02.700 --> 19:04.170
if there's anyone
that you've touched

19:04.170 --> 19:05.740
or who might've touched you.

19:06.770 --> 19:08.040
Um...

19:08.040 --> 19:10.680
I don't remember any of it.
Okay.

19:19.120 --> 19:21.120
Inteo.

19:22.890 --> 19:23.690
Barrier spell.

19:23.690 --> 19:26.090
Means that no one
can get in or out

19:26.090 --> 19:28.000
without me saying so.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.000
Including you.

19:31.700 --> 19:34.000
Is this about Hope?
Guess she's not the only one

19:34.000 --> 19:35.740
that gets
to save your life today.

19:35.740 --> 19:37.240
So you're welcome.
Josie, you know

19:37.240 --> 19:39.040
I'm a phoenix, right?
I'm not a sitting duck.

19:39.040 --> 19:41.010
We have other options here.
Okay.

19:41.010 --> 19:42.580
Name one.

19:42.580 --> 19:43.910
Malivore sent the Oni for me.

19:43.910 --> 19:45.950
So I say we let the demon
possess me,

19:45.950 --> 19:47.750
and then you kill me
with this sword.

19:47.750 --> 19:49.620
Demon gets vanquished,
I resurrect, we win.

19:49.620 --> 19:50.990
If it works, Landon.

19:50.990 --> 19:53.050
I'm not handing you
to some demon to find out.

19:53.050 --> 19:55.120
This is exactly what I wanted
to talk to your dad about.

19:55.120 --> 19:57.020
Forcing everyone else
to put themselves in danger

19:57.020 --> 19:59.590
to stop whatever monster's
coming after me next

19:59.590 --> 20:01.830
is an unsustainable solution.

20:01.830 --> 20:03.160
No, landfills are
an unsustainable solution.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.230
Keeping you alive is not.
End of discussion.

20:05.230 --> 20:07.770
(screams)
What is it?
What's wrong?

20:08.640 --> 20:11.210
It's spelled with black magic.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.670
A lot of it.

20:12.670 --> 20:14.640
Another reason
we are not doing this.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.240
W-Wait, where are you going?

20:16.240 --> 20:17.950
To get backup.

20:18.810 --> 20:20.080
(thud)
Ow.

20:22.250 --> 20:24.250
(groaning softly)

20:29.120 --> 20:31.660
I bet you'd stab me
if I was possessed.

20:32.790 --> 20:34.330
Did you find Raf?
ALARIC:
Yeah.

20:34.330 --> 20:36.660
We sent him back to campus.
The Oni wasn't in him,

20:36.660 --> 20:38.100
so it could be anywhere.
I'll find it.

20:38.100 --> 20:40.300
As long as you convince Landon
not to sacrifice himself

20:40.300 --> 20:41.800
to stop this thing.
HOPE: No.

20:43.770 --> 20:46.340
Uh, no, he-he can't do that.

20:46.340 --> 20:48.280
I mean, we can't give
the monster what it wants.

20:48.280 --> 20:50.940
Especially when what it wants
is my boyfriend.

20:50.940 --> 20:52.880
Who's only
doing this because

20:52.880 --> 20:55.120
he thinks that
it's all his fault.
Boyfriend?

20:55.120 --> 20:57.380
Why don't I try to talk
some sense into him.

20:57.380 --> 20:58.790
Okay?

21:01.660 --> 21:03.660
(birds chirping)

21:03.660 --> 21:05.330
I have so enjoyed
our time together.

21:05.330 --> 21:07.090
Same.

21:07.090 --> 21:11.230
Though I feel that we are
not as close as we could be.

21:12.270 --> 21:14.800
And I wish for us to be...

21:15.970 --> 21:17.840
(chuckles)

21:17.840 --> 21:20.140
...skin to skin.

21:22.910 --> 21:25.050
I have but one question to ask.

21:25.050 --> 21:27.980
(quietly):
Yeah.

21:27.980 --> 21:31.850
Do you have access to...
No, I am not a virgin.

21:31.850 --> 21:34.320
...a moderate-to-large supply
of human blood?

21:34.320 --> 21:37.120
Oh.

21:37.120 --> 21:38.760
(twigs snapping)

21:41.360 --> 21:42.730
I know how this looks.

21:42.730 --> 21:45.670
Like you're a
freaking stalker?

21:45.670 --> 21:46.900
Leave now,
before Sebastian

21:46.900 --> 21:49.000
kicks your ass.
Lizzie.

21:49.000 --> 21:50.970
I don't think
that's gonna be a problem.

21:53.210 --> 21:55.140
Fine. I'm gonna
kick your ass.

21:55.140 --> 21:56.880
Look, just...
Get this thing
out of my face.

21:56.880 --> 22:00.050
Just watch it. Please.

22:01.750 --> 22:03.150
(camcorder beeps)

22:04.820 --> 22:07.890
No, I'm not a virgin.

22:07.890 --> 22:09.860
What the hell is this?

22:10.990 --> 22:13.430
Sebastian was
right next to me.

22:13.430 --> 22:14.900
I'm really sorry.

22:14.900 --> 22:17.030
But this was the only way
I could think of

22:17.030 --> 22:20.300
to get you to see
what everyone else is gonna see.

22:20.300 --> 22:22.040
Sebastian's not real.

22:22.040 --> 22:23.700
Shut up.

22:23.700 --> 22:25.310
Just shut up.

22:30.440 --> 22:33.710
You and me...

22:33.710 --> 22:35.280
we're not friends.

22:37.180 --> 22:39.490
We never were,
and we never will be.

22:39.490 --> 22:42.460
So see this:

22:42.460 --> 22:46.030
you don't exist to me.

22:54.100 --> 22:55.470
Hey.

22:55.470 --> 22:57.270
(door closes)

22:57.270 --> 22:59.810
Josie dropped the barrier spell
so I could get in.

23:01.140 --> 23:02.840
There's a demon loose
inside the school somewhere.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.310
We have to get you
to somewhere safe.

23:04.310 --> 23:06.480
There is nowhere safe.
Okay, well,

23:06.480 --> 23:08.850
somewhere safer than here.

23:11.850 --> 23:13.450
If this is the one thing

23:13.450 --> 23:16.160
that can kill an Oni,
what if it's the one thing

23:16.160 --> 23:18.160
that can kill a phoenix, too?

23:27.730 --> 23:28.800
Josie told me that

23:28.800 --> 23:32.270
you think the monsters
being back is your fault.

23:32.270 --> 23:34.310
But it isn't.

23:35.180 --> 23:37.310
What do you know about it?

23:38.780 --> 23:40.380
Too much. (scoffs)

23:40.380 --> 23:42.650
Trust me, Landon, even though

23:42.650 --> 23:45.320
you might have
the best intentions,

23:45.320 --> 23:47.590
not every sacrifice
is worth it.

23:47.590 --> 23:49.520
No matter how much
you think it is.

23:49.520 --> 23:51.830
You said this isn't my fault?

23:51.830 --> 23:52.890
It isn't.

23:52.890 --> 23:55.530
Then whose is it?

23:55.530 --> 23:57.400
That doesn't matter.
We need to...

23:57.400 --> 23:59.500
It matters to me.

24:04.270 --> 24:05.610
It's my fault.

24:08.580 --> 24:10.610
I'm the one that
went into the pit.

24:10.610 --> 24:13.280
I thought it was
the only way to save you.

24:13.280 --> 24:16.750
Why would you want to save me?

24:16.750 --> 24:19.790
Because we were...
we were friends.

24:19.790 --> 24:23.560
Come on, there had to be
more to it than that.

24:23.560 --> 24:26.290
Tell me.

24:28.560 --> 24:30.560
You're gonna hate me if I do.

24:30.560 --> 24:33.500
Let me make that decision
for myself.

24:37.340 --> 24:38.910
We were in love.

24:40.770 --> 24:42.780
Yeah, I know that
you don't remember.

24:42.780 --> 24:45.410
I know that
it doesn't make any sense.

24:45.410 --> 24:46.910
But I can't let you

24:46.910 --> 24:49.850
risk your life because I tried
to give up mine to save it.

24:57.620 --> 25:01.590
So, uh, we have to find
another solution.

25:04.930 --> 25:07.770
One that doesn't involve
you being possessed.

25:09.770 --> 25:10.870
It's too late.

25:22.250 --> 25:23.550
What happened? Where's Landon?

25:23.550 --> 25:24.950
Josie, just give her a second.

25:24.950 --> 25:26.090
But you said you
were gonna help.

25:26.090 --> 25:28.090
Were you possessed?
No.

25:28.090 --> 25:30.020
Landon was.
That's impossible.

25:30.020 --> 25:31.060
How?

25:31.060 --> 25:32.430
Uh, we thought Raf was gonna

25:32.430 --> 25:35.400
pass the Oni on to somebody
at the pep rally.

25:38.500 --> 25:42.000
Kurutta must've been possessed
after Raf attacked him.

25:45.440 --> 25:47.240
The Oni waited to be
alone with Landon,

25:47.240 --> 25:48.580
took control of him and...

25:48.580 --> 25:50.380
Sayonara, samurai.

25:50.380 --> 25:52.310
Okay, well, where
would he have gone?

25:52.310 --> 25:54.110
I mean, my guess
is the portal.

25:54.110 --> 25:55.450
Well, we don't even know
where that is.

25:55.450 --> 25:57.250
Wait. Do you have something
of Landon's?

25:57.250 --> 25:58.950
'Cause you both could do
a locator spell right now.

25:58.950 --> 26:01.220
Yeah, but that's not mine.

26:06.330 --> 26:08.500
ALARIC:
The sheriff
must have left this.

26:19.310 --> 26:20.670
Love note?

26:20.670 --> 26:22.140
That's not for you.

26:30.250 --> 26:33.550
(both chanting
in foreign language)

26:33.550 --> 26:37.660
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

26:37.660 --> 26:40.230
Of course he isn't real.

26:40.230 --> 26:44.030
No real guy ever likes you,

26:44.030 --> 26:47.130
'cause you're messed up inside.

26:47.130 --> 26:49.670
And everybody knows it.

26:49.670 --> 26:51.440
Everyone except you.

26:51.440 --> 26:56.380
Because you are a stupid, crazy
person who talks to herself.

26:56.380 --> 26:59.250
♪ Why was he holding her hand ♪

26:59.250 --> 27:02.520
♪ When he's supposed
to be mine... ♪

27:02.520 --> 27:05.220
(mouth full):
Why are you carrying a sword?

27:05.220 --> 27:07.450
♪ And I'll cry if I want to ♪

27:07.450 --> 27:09.690
♪ Cry if I want to,
cry if I want to... ♪

27:09.690 --> 27:10.720
Landon!

27:10.720 --> 27:13.090
♪ You would cry, too ♪

27:13.090 --> 27:16.100
♪ If it happened to you. ♪

27:18.030 --> 27:19.600
Fugere.

27:19.600 --> 27:23.070
I'm guessing you're possessed
by an insanity demon.

27:24.440 --> 27:25.670
(grunts)

27:25.670 --> 27:27.740
Welcome to the club.

27:27.740 --> 27:29.510
(exhales sharply)

27:34.480 --> 27:35.650
(dog whines)

27:37.080 --> 27:39.220
Dress rehearsal.

27:39.220 --> 27:41.590
Please come to our full

27:41.590 --> 27:45.160
historical reenactment
performance on Commonwealth Day.

27:50.330 --> 27:52.500
(crackling, whooshing)

27:54.070 --> 27:56.200
(groans softly)

27:57.500 --> 27:58.770
(knock on door)

27:58.770 --> 28:01.110
MAC: Oh. I thought
I was losing my mind.

28:01.110 --> 28:04.210
Thanks for finding my... bag.

28:04.210 --> 28:06.510
I was honest with you.

28:06.510 --> 28:08.620
The least you can do
is be honest with me.

28:08.620 --> 28:10.320
This is a huge
misunderstanding.

28:10.320 --> 28:12.090
Then why don't you
drop the act?

28:12.090 --> 28:14.090
Whatever you want,
you talk to me.

28:14.090 --> 28:15.790
And you leave my girls
out of this,

28:15.790 --> 28:17.460
or we're gonna have a problem.

28:20.230 --> 28:21.630
I only looked at your files

28:21.630 --> 28:24.130
because I wanted to see
if you were a good guy.

28:24.130 --> 28:26.400
And then I looked
into your girls

28:26.400 --> 28:28.600
'cause I wanted to see
if you were a good dad.

28:28.600 --> 28:31.840
So, sorry for wanting
to ask you out.

28:31.840 --> 28:34.210
It won't happen again.

28:39.610 --> 28:41.280
Landon!

28:43.380 --> 28:44.820
Lizzie, are you okay?

28:44.820 --> 28:46.320
No.

28:46.320 --> 28:48.290
I am super crazy.

28:48.290 --> 28:51.560
But at least
there's a reason this time.

28:52.830 --> 28:55.200
The demon's in me.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.370
So you thought I was a lunatic?
Oh, yeah.

29:02.370 --> 29:04.570
I mean, jury's still
out, by the way.

29:04.570 --> 29:07.170
I'm sorry.
I've got trust issues.

29:07.170 --> 29:08.340
It's not your fault.

29:08.340 --> 29:09.880
I have a long history
of bad luck

29:09.880 --> 29:11.140
when it comes to relationships.

29:11.140 --> 29:14.180
It's not fair to
put that on you.

29:14.180 --> 29:15.620
(sighs)

29:15.620 --> 29:16.780
Some detective, huh?

29:16.780 --> 29:18.850
That's okay. I've got one of
those long histories, too.

29:18.850 --> 29:20.120
Oh, I know.

29:20.120 --> 29:22.160
Read your file. Remember?

29:22.160 --> 29:24.360
(chuckles)

29:24.360 --> 29:26.390
And yet, here I am,
flirting with you.

29:26.390 --> 29:28.190
Is that what we're doing?
Mm-hmm.

29:28.190 --> 29:30.200
(laughs)

29:33.530 --> 29:35.800
Really screwed this up,
didn't we?

29:35.800 --> 29:37.170
Oh... (laughs)

29:37.170 --> 29:39.740
Well, at least
it was a team effort.

29:39.740 --> 29:40.740
(laughs)

29:40.740 --> 29:42.740
Uh, tell you what.

29:42.740 --> 29:45.210
I'll be at the Mystic
Tap later tonight,

29:45.210 --> 29:46.810
if you want to get a drink.

29:48.320 --> 29:49.750
And a clean slate.

29:55.760 --> 29:57.460
(chains rattling)

29:57.460 --> 30:00.390
(growls) Oh, sorry,
that is embarrassing.

30:00.390 --> 30:02.360
We haven't met yet, have we?

30:02.360 --> 30:04.160
I'm Lizzie.

30:04.160 --> 30:05.370
(laughs)

30:05.370 --> 30:06.830
I don't understand.

30:06.830 --> 30:09.900
If the Oni is in you,
then how are you talking?

30:09.900 --> 30:12.370
I don't know,
but I-I can feel it in my head,

30:12.370 --> 30:13.440
trying to take over.

30:13.440 --> 30:15.380
I don't know
how much longer I...

30:17.210 --> 30:19.650
Never mind.

30:19.650 --> 30:21.210
It's gone.

30:21.210 --> 30:22.720
You can untie me.

30:24.380 --> 30:25.650
I didn't say that.

30:25.650 --> 30:27.250
It did, okay?

30:27.250 --> 30:29.660
Still in me, so don't--

30:29.660 --> 30:30.920
Listen to me.

30:30.920 --> 30:32.730
I'm fine.

30:32.730 --> 30:35.230
We should probably get
out of here before we...

30:35.230 --> 30:36.260
(groans, laughs)

30:36.260 --> 30:38.870
Okay. You have got to stop me.

30:38.870 --> 30:41.630
Please. Otherwise,
this thing is gonna win.

30:41.630 --> 30:43.570
She's fighting the demon
somehow, like Kurutta did.

30:43.570 --> 30:46.670
I already know I'm crazy, okay?
You don't have to rub it in.

30:46.670 --> 30:48.640
Kurutta was not crazy
and neither are you.

30:48.640 --> 30:50.240
Where's Dad?

30:50.240 --> 30:52.250
I just want Dad.
Kurutta fought the Oni
for years, okay?

30:52.250 --> 30:54.310
If you can just give us a little
bit of time, then we can...

30:54.310 --> 30:56.920
No. I can't live
like this anymore.

30:56.920 --> 30:58.280
(sobs)

30:58.280 --> 31:01.420
Sebastian isn't real.

31:01.420 --> 31:03.490
This whole time,
I thought I was better,

31:03.490 --> 31:05.530
but I have just been
seeing things,

31:05.530 --> 31:09.460
and hearing things and feeling
things that no one else does.

31:10.800 --> 31:13.530
And it's scary.

31:13.530 --> 31:15.800
Scarier than
any demon in my head.

31:15.800 --> 31:16.940
Although that sucks, too.

31:16.940 --> 31:17.940
JOSIE:
Lizzie.

31:17.940 --> 31:19.840
Lizzie, it's okay, okay?

31:19.840 --> 31:21.410
We're gonna fix you.
No.

31:21.410 --> 31:23.240
There's no fixing me, Jo.

31:23.240 --> 31:25.680
I am just... shattered.

31:25.680 --> 31:27.910
(sobs)

31:27.910 --> 31:30.920
The pieces are too small
to put back together.

31:32.450 --> 31:34.450
Tell Dad that I love him.

31:34.450 --> 31:36.020
But you have to end this.

31:36.020 --> 31:37.720
What?

31:37.720 --> 31:40.460
With that sword.

31:40.460 --> 31:42.530
Whoa. I know that we just met,

31:42.530 --> 31:45.870
but there's no way that
we are gonna let that happen.

31:45.870 --> 31:47.730
(demonic voice):
You have no choice.

31:47.730 --> 31:50.470
This will not stop
until you give me the boy.

31:52.540 --> 31:54.270
JOSIE:
Lizzie?

31:54.270 --> 31:56.710
Lizzie, you got
to fight this thing.

31:56.710 --> 31:58.340
(demonic voice):
Fighting is useless.

31:58.340 --> 31:59.750
Malivore still lives,

31:59.750 --> 32:02.050
and his control over us
is stronger than ever.

32:02.050 --> 32:05.620
Soon, the likes of me will be
the least of your concerns.

32:07.490 --> 32:09.760
(normal voice):
Distracted during a monologue.

32:09.760 --> 32:10.990
(laughs)

32:10.990 --> 32:12.430
Classic villain mistake.

32:12.430 --> 32:13.630
(exhales)

32:14.490 --> 32:17.030
Jo, you got to do this.

32:17.030 --> 32:18.030
For me.

32:18.030 --> 32:20.000
Okay?

32:20.000 --> 32:21.600
It's only a matter of time

32:21.600 --> 32:23.970
before you kick my ass
in the Merge, anyway.

32:23.970 --> 32:25.540
(laughs)

32:25.540 --> 32:27.770
And this is better than
the Merge, because this way

32:27.770 --> 32:30.480
you won't have to live with
some messed-up part of me

32:30.480 --> 32:31.710
in your brain forever,

32:31.710 --> 32:33.650
driving you as crazy I am.

32:33.650 --> 32:37.350
We weren't gonna talk about that
until we had real solutions.

32:37.350 --> 32:38.820
Well, maybe this is it.

32:38.820 --> 32:40.720
(crying out)

32:42.520 --> 32:44.790
Josie, it's coming back.
Please.

32:44.790 --> 32:46.590
(whimpers)
You got to do it.

32:48.460 --> 32:50.830
If Josie won't do this,
then you have to.

32:54.530 --> 32:55.800
(metal ringing softly)

32:57.340 --> 32:59.810
(groaning)

32:59.810 --> 33:02.710
There's so much black magic
in it, it hurts to hold.

33:02.710 --> 33:06.910
Probably won't feel much better
getting stabbed by it. (laughs)

33:08.550 --> 33:10.920
I can pull the magic
out of this,

33:10.920 --> 33:13.690
I may be able
to get the Oni out of you.

33:15.920 --> 33:17.960
(metal ringing, whooshing)

33:22.430 --> 33:25.900
(screaming)

33:28.740 --> 33:30.540
(roaring)

33:37.440 --> 33:39.610
(roaring continues)

33:43.950 --> 33:45.450
(roaring stops)

33:49.960 --> 33:51.520
(panting)

33:51.520 --> 33:53.690
(gasping)

33:55.130 --> 33:57.600
You did it.

33:59.100 --> 34:01.170
I love you.

34:01.170 --> 34:03.540
You better.

34:12.880 --> 34:15.620
(distorted, overlapping chatter)

34:18.150 --> 34:20.120
(panting)

34:20.120 --> 34:21.920
Hey.

34:24.990 --> 34:27.590
It was you.
Uh, yeah,
that moved you here? Yeah.

34:27.590 --> 34:29.930
Didn't really want you
bursting into flames in
the middle of town square.

34:32.830 --> 34:34.800
That's not
what I'm talking about.

34:36.500 --> 34:39.970
Why do I see you
every time I die?

34:50.180 --> 34:52.950
You should get back to Josie.

35:01.230 --> 35:02.960
Ms. Saltzman.

35:02.960 --> 35:05.400
What's wrong?

35:06.700 --> 35:08.700
I did black magic.

35:08.700 --> 35:10.940
Not on purpose this time.

35:10.940 --> 35:12.770
After this morning's
declaration,

35:12.770 --> 35:16.040
I can only assume
it was absolutely necessary.

35:16.040 --> 35:18.950
I feel really sick.

35:18.950 --> 35:21.980
You said you had something
that could help.

35:37.700 --> 35:39.070
This is a mora miserium,

35:39.070 --> 35:41.100
a tool used by
certain sects of witches

35:41.100 --> 35:45.470
to withhold the ill effects
of using such magic.

35:47.510 --> 35:48.840
For how long?

35:48.840 --> 35:50.780
Indefinitely.

35:50.780 --> 35:53.110
So long as it
doesn't shatter.

35:56.150 --> 35:59.290
Simply place your
hands on the glass,

35:59.290 --> 36:01.920
and all will be
as it should be.

36:09.900 --> 36:11.530
(quiet whooshing)

36:19.310 --> 36:21.540
(sighs)

No, he can't see me.
