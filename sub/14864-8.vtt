"A fine reward is offered for the return
of a slave woman stolen...

03:23.746 --> 03:27.614
"or absconded from
the house of Claudius Appius.

03:27.750 --> 03:30.332
"The following noblemen returning from Greece

03:30.461 --> 03:35.046

"Glorious Caesar follows."

Shoulder arms!

FonNard!

FonNard face!

04:35.943 --> 04:38.275
FonNard march!

05:24.658 --> 05:27.525
Behold, Ptolemy,

05:27.661 --> 05:33.702
he of the two ladies, he of sedge and bee.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.960
Behold Ptolemy,

05:38.088 --> 05:43.082
son of Ra, Ptolemy the divine.

05:49.683 --> 05:52.015
Greetings.

06:21.882 --> 06:25.295
How long may we hope
for the blessing of your presence?

06:25.427 --> 06:28.339
— Not long.
— Oh, we are desolated.

06:28.472 --> 06:32.590
If his glorious honour cares
to divulge his purpose here,

06:32.726 --> 06:39.768
the servants of the mighty lion would be
ecstatic to help you in any way whatsoever.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.016
That is most kind of you.

06:45.155 --> 06:47.988
How goes your preparation for war?

06:48.993 --> 06:51.200
War?

06:51.328 --> 06:54.616
— We have no war prepared.
— l'm misinformed, then.

06:54.748 --> 07:00.334
l was told the sister of the mighty lion
disputes his right to the throne.

07:00.462 --> 07:02.714
Do not speak of her.

07:02.840 --> 07:05.673
I piss on her! | shit on her!

07:06.302 --> 07:13.344
It is true our beloved princess has listened
to ill counsel and raised some absurd claim.

07:13.475 --> 07:19.687
But...she has no support,
none but traitors and barbarians.

07:21.317 --> 07:23.478
What was that name?

07:23.611 --> 07:27.650
Deilogos of Pergamum.
He can raise ten legions.

07:27.781 --> 07:32.992
Deilogos of Pergamum
can raise ten legions for her.

07:33.120 --> 07:37.329
A petty bandit. I assure you,
you have no problem,

07:37.458 --> 07:40.666
no fears at all about Cleopatra.

07:40.794 --> 07:44.332
- Where is she?
— Well, nobody knows.

07:44.465 --> 07:47.207
Somewhere in the south, we believe.

07:47.343 --> 07:50.176
He lies. They have her.

07:50.304 --> 07:54.343
This dispute between you both must end.

07:54.475 --> 07:57.387
Rome desires Egypt to be at peace.

07:57.519 --> 08:00.511
Your grain ships must keep sailing.

08:00.648 --> 08:04.561
We are in absolute control of the country,
from the Lighthouse to the Cataracts.

08:04.693 --> 08:09.357
Good, in that case you should have no trouble
in handing over Pompey Magnus.

08:09.490 --> 08:13.028
I do not like his tone. He can go.

08:14.828 --> 08:19.538
Master, do you remember
what we spoke of before?

08:19.667 --> 08:21.623
Of crocodile and fox?

08:23.212 --> 08:25.453
Let us show him our surprise!

08:25.589 --> 08:28.331
All right, go on. Show him.

08:31.845 --> 08:35.679
We have a gift for you, glorious excellency,

08:35.808 --> 08:38.800
that we think you will be very pleased with.

09:16.807 --> 09:18.547
We were going to make him a body,

09:18.684 --> 09:22.097
moving arms and legs, and do
a mime show with real animals...

09:22.229 --> 09:23.890
Silence!

09:34.158 --> 09:38.777
Shame on the house of Ptolemies
for such barbarity. Shame.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.699
But...you are enemies.

09:41.832 --> 09:43.743
He was a consul of Rome!

09:51.925 --> 09:54.416
A consul of Rome.

09:55.429 --> 09:58.011
To die in this sordid way,

09:58.140 --> 10:02.383
quartered like some low thief.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.225
Shame!

10:07.149 --> 10:09.231
Where is the rest of him?

10:09.359 --> 10:15.320
lt...he has been cremated...
with all proper funeral rites of course.

10:15.449 --> 10:18.031
With all decorum.

10:18.160 --> 10:20.822
I shall return tomorrow,

10:20.954 --> 10:25.994
at which time you will give me
the man that took Pompey's life.

11:27.229 --> 11:29.971
Captain says the wind is fair.

11:30.107 --> 11:34.316
— Good.
— We can leave whenever you like.

11:34.444 --> 11:38.687
You will take half the men,
return to Rome immediately.

11:38.824 --> 11:42.988
You shall have the honour
of announcing Pompey's death.

11:43.120 --> 11:45.202
I shall follow you...

11:46.248 --> 11:48.204
when I've settled things here.

11:53.630 --> 11:57.293
Settled things? Settled what things?

11:57.426 --> 12:00.088
Civil war is in the air.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.302
It must be prevented.

12:03.515 --> 12:05.301
Why?

12:05.434 --> 12:08.642
Let the wretches fight it out.

12:08.770 --> 12:11.147
War will disrupt the grain supply.

12:11.273 --> 12:15.482
Without Egyptian grain, Rome goes hungry.

12:15.611 --> 12:20.196
It would be...unwise not to intervene.

12:20.324 --> 12:23.566
And how will you intervene
with only half a legion?

12:23.702 --> 12:26.318
I do not intend to fight.

12:26.455 --> 12:30.664
I shall merely arbitrate the various factions.

12:30.792 --> 12:33.169
You make it sound so easy.

12:33.295 --> 12:38.085
Those various factions are united
only by their hatred of Rome.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.883
He's right.

12:42.012 --> 12:46.176
Ptolemy might use you to rouse
the people against a common enemy.

12:46.308 --> 12:49.516
l have conquered Gaul.

12:49.645 --> 12:51.260
l have defeated Pompey Magnus.

12:51.396 --> 12:54.604
I think I can handle a small boy and a eunuch.

12:54.733 --> 12:59.648
— A small boy with 100,000 men.
- I am aware of that!

12:59.780 --> 13:01.771
He's still a boy nonetheless.

13:01.907 --> 13:06.617
You seem to forget that our war is not over yet.

13:07.537 --> 13:12.531
Cato and Scipio are still at large.
Given time, they will raise another army.

13:12.668 --> 13:15.034
And when they do I shall crush them.

13:15.170 --> 13:20.164
I'm glad you're so confident.
Some would call it hubris.

13:20.300 --> 13:23.292
It's only hubris if I fail.

13:30.185 --> 13:33.848
Remember, she is a princess of ancient blood.

13:33.981 --> 13:37.473
When you find her you will treat
her with the utmost respect.

13:37.609 --> 13:41.443
You must obey her in all things, within reason.

13:41.571 --> 13:43.357
Understood, sir.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.321
l'm counting on you, Vorenus.

13:48.954 --> 13:50.694
You have something to say?

13:50.831 --> 13:53.994
Regarding Pompey Magnus,
sir, I wish to apologise.

13:55.252 --> 13:58.995
It was my actions that
brought him here to this end.

14:00.215 --> 14:03.002
— If I had done my duty...
—|ndeed.

14:04.511 --> 14:05.500
Dismissed.

14:32.164 --> 14:33.825
Pompey's murderer.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.870
Alas, he has run away.

14:38.003 --> 14:39.868
Find him.

14:41.048 --> 14:43.130
In the meantime,

14:43.258 --> 14:46.921
these instruments tabulate
the money that was borrowed

14:47.054 --> 14:51.263
by his majesty's illustrious father, Ptolemy Xll.

14:51.391 --> 14:54.599
In the name of the Republic,
l have come to collect.

14:54.728 --> 14:57.686
17 thousand thousand drachma.

15:02.319 --> 15:04.401
17?

15:05.614 --> 15:08.196
Absurd!

15:08.325 --> 15:09.531
Four, perhaps.

15:09.659 --> 15:13.868
The tabulation includes
all monies borrowed from Pompey

15:13.997 --> 15:17.956
and other agents of the Republic
now unable to collect.

15:18.085 --> 15:19.666
That is notjust!

15:19.795 --> 15:24.084
Postmortem interests of this type are
legally entailed to the presiding consul,

15:24.216 --> 15:27.174
ie...Gaius Julius Caesar.

15:27.302 --> 15:30.044
— lt's law.
— Roman law.

15:30.180 --> 15:35.766
Is there some other form of law...
you wretched woman?

15:37.896 --> 15:41.639
One thousand apologies. Forgive us.

15:47.030 --> 15:49.396
There!

15:49.533 --> 15:53.196
— There's for your payment.
- So sorry.

15:53.328 --> 15:56.991
His majesty forgets he is a vassal to Rome.

15:57.124 --> 16:00.457
Vassal? Vassal? I am no vassal!

16:00.585 --> 16:03.793
— I am king! lam...
— Sit down!

16:13.014 --> 16:14.629
Thank you.

16:14.766 --> 16:17.143
When can I expect payment?

16:17.269 --> 16:22.434
Your honour, we have little enough
ready coin for our own needs.

16:22.566 --> 16:26.775
Our tax farmers have not been
working as they should because...

16:26.903 --> 16:29.110
Because?

16:29.239 --> 16:34.700
Cleopatra's foolishness has
stirred unrest in some parts.

16:34.828 --> 16:36.693
Nothing serious.

16:38.248 --> 16:42.582
Well, I do not wish to appear unreasonable.

16:42.711 --> 16:46.954
I will accept ten thousand thousand drachma.

16:47.090 --> 16:50.298
Even that amount
will take many days to collect.

16:50.427 --> 16:53.635
In that case, I shall have
ample time to adjudicate

16:53.763 --> 16:56.550
your dispute with Princess Cleopatra.

16:56.683 --> 16:58.469
Excellent notion.

16:58.602 --> 17:01.810
But alas, who knows
where Princess Cleopatra is?

17:01.938 --> 17:05.522
Oh, do not worry about that. I shall find her.

17:16.578 --> 17:19.160
Blood and fire!

17:19.289 --> 17:21.575
It's as hot as Vulcan's dick!

17:26.922 --> 17:29.288
What a dump.

17:29.424 --> 17:32.416
Gyppo gods must be right
wasters to make a place like this.

17:32.552 --> 17:36.090
Don't speak ill of the gods in their own country.

17:38.225 --> 17:40.011
I've seen their gods.

17:40.143 --> 17:43.180
Titus Pullo isn't scared of
any bastard with a dog's head on him.

17:43.313 --> 17:48.307
More fool you.
These gods are old and powerful.

17:48.443 --> 17:51.435
Egypt was a great nation long before Rome.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.357
Was it?

17:53.490 --> 17:55.526
Mumped it up now, then, haven't they?

18:01.122 --> 18:03.329
Why are we here, anyhow?

18:03.458 --> 18:07.576
— Waiting.
— Yeah, I know we're waiting but for who?

18:07.712 --> 18:10.089
I'll know when | see them.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.253
Be like that.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.003
"Vassal," he says!

18:18.139 --> 18:20.425
Barbarian scum!

18:21.434 --> 18:23.425
It's simple extortion.

18:23.561 --> 18:26.769
If we do not pay him, he will
put Cleopatra on the throne.

18:26.898 --> 18:30.641
lf...if he could find her.

18:30.777 --> 18:33.439
He is a resourceful man.

18:33.571 --> 18:36.153
He will find her.

18:36.283 --> 18:39.946
She should have died when we first caught her.

18:40.078 --> 18:43.536
Now it must be done. She must die.

18:43.665 --> 18:46.122
I agree.

18:47.544 --> 18:50.286
My men could be with her by nightfall.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.108
Tell him, wait.

20:49.499 --> 20:50.909
Cleopatra.

20:51.042 --> 20:52.873
Queen Majesty?

20:53.002 --> 20:56.244
Hutto asks to speak with you.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.178
Slap me.

21:15.442 --> 21:18.104
— Night or day?
— Night.

21:19.904 --> 21:21.690
He may enter.

21:27.954 --> 21:32.243
Majesty...fresh word
has come from Alexandria.

21:33.793 --> 21:36.455
Speak, worm!

21:36.588 --> 21:39.796
I am most deeply sorry to say,

21:39.924 --> 21:44.384
Majesty must prepare herself
for her journey to the afterlife.

21:48.308 --> 21:50.139
Now.

22:20.632 --> 22:22.668
Say your words.

23:34.747 --> 23:37.033
Hello, ladies.

23:37.834 --> 23:39.916
Attack Caesar?

23:42.422 --> 23:44.583
Are you serious?

23:44.716 --> 23:49.085
Why not? He only has
a few hundred men with him.

23:49.929 --> 23:52.466
How many men could you rally?

23:56.477 --> 23:59.139
You would be the liberator of Egypt.

23:59.272 --> 24:01.513
Your name would live for ever.

24:01.649 --> 24:03.856
My mortal flesh should be less fortunate.

24:03.985 --> 24:07.477
— Rome does not forget an injury.
- Oh, forget Rome!

24:07.614 --> 24:10.356
Rome is doomed.

24:10.491 --> 24:14.484
Her people tear at their flesh like mad dogs.

24:14.621 --> 24:18.455
In ten years the city will be a forgotten ruin.

24:18.583 --> 24:21.370
Maybe so, but what of next year?

24:21.502 --> 24:23.493
Perhaps you're right.

24:23.630 --> 24:27.919
Ergo, caution is best, yes.

24:29.135 --> 24:34.095
Perhaps you don't have enough influence
among the people.

24:36.225 --> 24:39.308
And Caesar has so few men.

24:40.688 --> 24:43.725
I could raise the whole city with a word.

24:45.902 --> 24:48.188
Think on it.

24:51.658 --> 24:56.823
Oh, do you think I could
borrow Septimius for a little while?

24:56.954 --> 24:59.036
I'd be most grateful.

25:01.417 --> 25:02.873
Of course.

25:12.762 --> 25:15.845
Messenger from Ptolemy Xlll begs entry, sir.

25:36.744 --> 25:39.326
"Ptolemy the water bringer,
he of the two ladies,

25:39.455 --> 25:41.662
"he of sedge and bee, king of kings, son of Ra,

25:41.791 --> 25:44.783
"informs his most grand honour, et cetera,

25:44.919 --> 25:48.878
"that him who bears this message
is him that killed Pompey."

26:25.501 --> 26:27.958
He's handsome enough.

26:28.087 --> 26:30.749
Good, strong chin.

26:30.882 --> 26:33.294
Looks like a mean old man to me.

26:36.929 --> 26:40.421
- More.
— Divinity's mortal flesh turns green.

26:40.558 --> 26:42.640
Give it here.

27:10.463 --> 27:14.047
She will look like a reptile
when she arrives at Alexandria.

27:24.894 --> 27:27.306
Weak, I call it.

27:35.571 --> 27:37.186
Weak, am |?

27:37.323 --> 27:39.530
She knows how to beat her slaves well enough

27:39.659 --> 27:44.028
but she cannot throw away that pipe
and she knows it.

27:44.163 --> 27:48.372
lnsolent dwarf. You know nothing.

27:51.671 --> 27:53.957
Throw it out.

27:56.342 --> 27:59.129
Throw...it out.

28:41.512 --> 28:43.548
Weak, am |?

28:49.937 --> 28:53.600
That Gyppo princess, now, that's good cunny.

28:53.733 --> 28:57.476
Her father's people rode with Alexander.
Don't speak of her like that.

28:57.612 --> 29:00.729
She is, though, and she wants me badly.

29:02.450 --> 29:07.114
Should've seen her when
I done that Nubian. Wet as October!

29:08.372 --> 29:10.328
Pullo, look at me.

29:10.458 --> 29:13.666
She is a princess of royal blood.
You touch her, you die.

29:13.794 --> 29:15.625
I'm not stupid.

29:15.755 --> 29:17.586
I'm just saying she wants me.

29:55.836 --> 29:58.418
Lovely. Lovely.

29:58.547 --> 30:01.835
Nothing like cold, stinking sweat
to seduce a man.

30:02.927 --> 30:05.794
Caesar will think himself
on Olympus with Aphrodite.

30:05.930 --> 30:07.716
Hush, piglet!

30:09.141 --> 30:12.258
What do you know of seduction?

30:13.479 --> 30:16.516
As long as Caesar is a man,

30:16.649 --> 30:18.230
lwill have him.

30:18.359 --> 30:20.645
She seems very sure of herself.

30:21.445 --> 30:25.404
l have him...or I die.

30:27.076 --> 30:29.237
So I will have him.

30:29.370 --> 30:32.077
May it be so, lsis.

30:49.849 --> 30:52.716
| only wish he were here today.

30:52.852 --> 30:56.595
My womb is between the flood.

30:58.357 --> 31:02.691
A child would come, as sure as spring.

31:30.056 --> 31:32.138
Come.

31:34.018 --> 31:36.304
You, come.

31:51.494 --> 31:53.450
So red!

31:53.579 --> 31:56.696
Your highness, how can I be of service?

32:01.087 --> 32:04.329
Leather. Olives. Not so bad.

32:09.095 --> 32:14.089
- He will do.
— Majesty commands you will enter her.

32:14.225 --> 32:15.965
I do not understand.

32:16.102 --> 32:18.844
You have coitus with her.

32:18.979 --> 32:21.846
You have it wrong.
Coitus means to make babies.

32:21.982 --> 32:24.849
Exact! So, make babies.

32:29.949 --> 32:31.940
Don't be scared.

32:32.076 --> 32:36.285
I'm not scared, ljust cannot do what you ask!

32:36.413 --> 32:38.995
It is not...it is not in our custom.

32:39.125 --> 32:42.583
Roman men are not used
by women in this way.

32:42.711 --> 32:45.669
Come, you will enjoy it.

32:45.798 --> 32:48.540
My queen is an excellent lover.

33:19.540 --> 33:21.656
What is he waiting for?

33:24.211 --> 33:26.588
He must do as he is told!

33:26.714 --> 33:29.000
— Let me give you a hand.
— Get off!

33:29.133 --> 33:33.342
I must ask forgiveness of
your majesty but I cannot comply!

33:33.470 --> 33:35.756
I am no slave to be commanded so!

33:35.890 --> 33:39.849
— With all respect...
- He refuses?

33:39.977 --> 33:45.893
This...insect refuses me?

33:46.025 --> 33:50.189
You dare refuse
the daughter of a sun god?

33:52.114 --> 33:56.528
Pullo, report immediately
to Princess Cleopatra and do as she says!

33:56.911 --> 33:58.492
You heard!

33:58.621 --> 34:01.408
— What's going on?
- Just go.

34:14.637 --> 34:17.674
Legionary Titus Pullo reporting for duty, ma'am.

35:34.133 --> 35:37.341
— Gods, that was something...
- I don't want to know.

35:38.304 --> 35:42.013
If you value your life,
you won't speak of it again.

35:42.141 --> 35:46.851
Why? l was only obeying orders.
Bloody good orders too.

35:46.979 --> 35:50.597
What do you think Caesar
will do if he hears of it?

35:50.733 --> 35:52.815
I'm not stupid.

35:53.777 --> 35:56.644
I promised the princess. I shall not speak of it.

35:56.780 --> 36:01.649
You can't keep a secret to save your life.
You've got a mouth like a drain.

36:22.389 --> 36:25.051
You men, the gate now!

36:49.333 --> 36:51.073
Princess Cleopatra, sir.

36:51.210 --> 36:55.920
Daughter of the Two Rams,
mistress of sedge and bee.

37:40.300 --> 37:42.291
Well done, Majesty!

37:42.428 --> 37:44.214
Thank you.

38:32.019 --> 38:35.603
Is something wrong, little husband?

38:50.162 --> 38:53.450
How funny you look in Father's chair.

38:54.458 --> 38:56.323
I never wanted to harm you.

38:58.045 --> 39:01.003
Of course you did not.

39:01.131 --> 39:06.091
It was your gelding led you astray, no doubt.

39:06.220 --> 39:09.257
— Mistress...
— It must not speak.

39:12.017 --> 39:13.678
It must die!

39:29.535 --> 39:31.526
It was him...

39:33.747 --> 39:35.408
not me.

39:36.416 --> 39:39.408
He led him astray,

39:39.545 --> 39:41.581
not me.

39:41.713 --> 39:43.795
It was him!

40:34.266 --> 40:36.302
Get in formation!

40:44.026 --> 40:46.108
And you, Pullo.

40:53.410 --> 40:55.651
Calpurnia...

40:59.708 --> 41:02.290
She's your third wife?

41:02.419 --> 41:04.034
She is.

41:09.343 --> 41:12.005
Has she given you a son?

41:12.137 --> 41:14.344
She has not.

41:15.724 --> 41:18.090
How sad.

41:18.226 --> 41:21.514
A man without sons is a man without a future.

41:22.814 --> 41:25.305
I never thought of it that way.

41:28.111 --> 41:30.693
Sad.

41:30.822 --> 41:32.904
Never mind.

41:34.660 --> 41:37.868
Have you secured the upriver ports?

41:37.996 --> 41:40.373
You must do so immediately.

41:40.499 --> 41:44.117
Whoever controls the ports controls Egypt.

41:46.213 --> 41:49.000
Good advice, no doubt.

41:49.132 --> 41:52.215
— If I wanted to control Egypt.
- Of course you do.

41:53.136 --> 41:55.172
Why else are you here?

41:55.305 --> 41:58.843
And why save me so heroically from death...

41:59.726 --> 42:05.016
if not to use me as your...puppet queen?

42:09.152 --> 42:11.734
Do you dislike the notion?

42:11.863 --> 42:14.855
My wishes are immaterial.

42:16.034 --> 42:19.242
You redeemed me from captivity.

42:19.371 --> 42:22.704
l am...your slave.

44:55.360 --> 44:57.396
Testudo!

45:39.404 --> 45:43.943
— Are you well?
— Well enough, though I do not sleep.

45:44.075 --> 45:46.282
| write very bad poetry through the night

45:46.411 --> 45:49.118
and in the morning
I give it to the cook for the fire.

45:49.247 --> 45:50.453
It's a form of magic.

45:50.582 --> 45:56.168
My ill conscience is transformed
into roast birds and pastries.

45:56.296 --> 46:01.131
You should have no ill conscience.
We only did what we had to do.

46:02.052 --> 46:06.716
No doubt Saturn said something
of the sort after eating his children.

46:07.557 --> 46:09.593
The question is...

46:10.435 --> 46:12.801
if Caesar does not return from Egypt...

46:12.938 --> 46:15.304
Caesar has escaped tighter traps than this.

46:15.440 --> 46:19.308
He has been besieged in
Alexandria the better part of a year.

46:19.444 --> 46:21.230
Perhaps his luck has run out.

46:21.363 --> 46:26.949
Well, what fools we shall look
if we have kissed the feet of a dead man.

46:27.077 --> 46:33.038
With Caesar dead, that bastard Mark Antony
will be unleashed to do as he wants.

46:33.166 --> 46:38.411
Very likely, but it is no concern of mine.
I am done with politics.

46:38.546 --> 46:40.628
Self—pity is all very well.

46:41.466 --> 46:43.878
I'm not unashamed myself.

46:45.136 --> 46:48.344
But we are still senators.

46:48.473 --> 46:50.680
We have responsibilities.

46:50.809 --> 46:53.175
I remind you, we swore an oath of loyalty.

46:53.311 --> 46:56.428
To Caesar, not to Antony.

46:58.274 --> 47:01.766
Cato and Scipio have
raised an army in Numidia.

47:01.903 --> 47:06.146
If we were to communicate with them,
we might...we might...

47:06.282 --> 47:08.364
If it isn't Cicero.

47:09.327 --> 47:13.912
How strange. l...was just now thinking of you.

47:14.749 --> 47:16.580
I've received some happy news

47:16.710 --> 47:19.952
and my first thought was
to come and tell you two.

47:22.424 --> 47:23.914
And here you are.

47:25.593 --> 47:28.255
What a coincidence!

47:28.388 --> 47:31.425
lt's amusing how often that happens, eh?

47:31.558 --> 47:35.050
l was walking across the Forum
thinking of this particular woman.

47:35.186 --> 47:39.179
Who should arrive right in front of me
but the thing herself?

47:40.066 --> 47:42.808
Savage little Spanish creature.

47:42.944 --> 47:45.686
Hair down to her arse.

47:50.535 --> 47:53.151
Everyone misjudges me, you know.

47:54.247 --> 47:56.283
I'm a merciful man.

47:56.416 --> 48:00.409
I know that's not my reputation but I am.

48:02.213 --> 48:05.046
Now, everyone's entitled to a few mistakes.

48:05.175 --> 48:08.463
Gods know, I've made one or two myself.

48:10.013 --> 48:12.675
Oh, I've done things...

48:13.767 --> 48:17.726
things I'm ashamed to think of.

48:20.940 --> 48:24.899
We are, all of us, imperfect in our way.

48:25.028 --> 48:27.110
Exactly.

48:27.238 --> 48:30.230
We are, all of us, imperfect.

48:36.081 --> 48:39.039
Give me your hands, brother Cicero.

48:43.838 --> 48:45.874
With all my heart...

48:46.925 --> 48:48.586
I forgive you.

48:50.178 --> 48:52.464
I don't know what you mean.

48:54.682 --> 48:56.968
Nothing escapes me.

48:58.770 --> 49:02.934
If a pigeon dies on the Aventine, I hear of it.

49:05.944 --> 49:10.984
So be assured, brother, if I ever again

49:11.116 --> 49:16.952
hear your name connected
with murmurs of treachery...

49:22.627 --> 49:29.374
I will cut off these soft, pink hands

49:29.509 --> 49:33.047
and nail them to the Senate door.

49:50.655 --> 49:51.735
Antony?

49:53.241 --> 49:55.857
You said you had happy news to tell us.

49:55.994 --> 49:58.701
Yes. Of course.

49:58.830 --> 50:01.492
A courier came from Alexandria.

50:02.584 --> 50:06.998
Caesar has lifted the siege
and massacred the armies of Ptolemy.

50:07.130 --> 50:11.499
He is safe and sound and master of all Egypt.

50:15.471 --> 50:18.178
The man is a damn prodigy, eh?

50:36.576 --> 50:39.033
Attention!
