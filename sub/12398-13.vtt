SEAN: Years ago, Percy created Division.

he build in a failsafe.

00:14.765 --> 00:17.973
There's a tanker of VX gas tapped
into Division's ventilation system.

the place will be a mass grave.

-Division has become expendable.

in the activation of Clean Sweep.

we trigger it immediately.

-And everyone inside your facility dies.

for the next step.

There's a flaw in your plan.

01:30.549 --> 01:32.039

01:32.259 --> 01:35.626

through the facility...

01:35.846 --> 01:38.087

could be activated from anywhere.

grab the trigger.

Saving Division?

02:23.435 --> 02:24.470

Lives that are trying to kill us. Wanna
save them so they can keep trying?

02:28.857 --> 02:31.439
It's not about saving Division.
It's about ending this.

02:31.652 --> 02:34.314

02:35.739 --> 02:38.321

02:49.378 --> 02:51.289
You'll need more
than just her location.

You'll need a tactical breakdown
of the perimeter and the interior.

at gunpoint. Right now, no one knows.

you create national news.

Oh, I appreciate your concern,
but Percy's got a plan.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.858
Was it Percy's plan
to end up in a cell?

they'd like to share?

two hours to dismantle that bomb.

04:12.502 --> 04:15.369

-No.

Birkhoff, please, think of a way
to remotely deactivate the trigger.

04:43.450 --> 04:46.237
I told you, I would have seen
this system if it existed.

04:46.453 --> 04:49.866
It's not enough to pump gas in there,
you have to close off the vents...

04:50.081 --> 04:52.572
...shut down the elevators.
All of that takes power.

04:52.793 --> 04:56.536

-The emergency back-up?

05:03.512 --> 05:06.049
No, the generator that
used to power the missile base.

05:06.264 --> 05:07.765
Can you hack it?

05:08.225 --> 05:10.261

is cut the hard line.
