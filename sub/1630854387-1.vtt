Advance Research Laboratories.

in 1971.

Good to see you again,

I'm so, so happy
that you're all here.

My name is Bernard Fitzmartin

of Special Projects

12:59.528 --> 13:00.988
here at S.T.A.R. Laboratories.

This is Dr. Espenson,

the Director
of Applied Sciences,

13:04.283 --> 13:07.077
and we have got
a very big day planned.

13:07.161 --> 13:09.163
We've been scrambling a little,

13:09.246 --> 13:12.082
since we heard you were
coming today, but we've
managed to put together

13:12.166 --> 13:13.667
a few things for you.

13:13.751 --> 13:15.836
So, why don't I show you
what we've been working on,

13:15.920 --> 13:17.671
and you show us
what you can do.

if you don't mind
hanging back, um...

13:27.473 --> 13:30.309
Conner, I'm afraid
that I have some bad news.

Kal-El sends his regrets.

13:32.686 --> 13:33.854
He's not here?

13:33.938 --> 13:35.356
He was called away
on urgent business.

13:35.439 --> 13:38.400
A matter that did require
his immediate attention.

13:39.860 --> 13:40.736
I understand.

13:41.612 --> 13:42.696
I'm sorry.

13:42.780 --> 13:45.407

starting to like it.

What happened?

15:20.419 --> 15:21.795
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:24.715 --> 15:26.425
You turned into a gorilla.

15:26.508 --> 15:27.301
What?

15:27.384 --> 15:28.802
And a velociraptor.

15:28.886 --> 15:31.138
And one of those little guys,
with the, uh, the shell.

15:31.221 --> 15:32.598
Wh... what are they called?

A turtle?

Uh, no, they're from Texas.

15:35.309 --> 15:36.393
Uh, armarillo.

15:36.477 --> 15:38.354
-Armadillo.
-Yes, an armadillo.

15:38.437 --> 15:41.357
Apparently, the gorilla
had something against
my morphology lab.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.526
I'm... really sorry about that.

15:44.610 --> 15:46.445
And you don't remember
anything that happened?

15:47.404 --> 15:50.949
No. I... started to transform,

15:52.034 --> 15:52.993
and then...

15:53.077 --> 15:54.912
Look, has any...

15:54.995 --> 15:57.206
Has anything like this
ever happened before?

15:57.790 --> 15:58.791
No.

All right. Well, your, um,

16:00.626 --> 16:03.003

fluctuated slightly.

16:03.921 --> 16:05.047
Uh, but just to be sure,

16:05.130 --> 16:06.840
we will...
we will check the suit

16:06.924 --> 16:09.468
for any possible anomalies
before you leave, all right?

Mr. Grayson.

16:30.197 --> 16:32.366
Let's get this cleaned up,
all right?

16:32.449 --> 16:33.325
[mouthing] Okay.

He's extraordinary.

Go ahead
and put these on for me.

What?

17:22.499 --> 17:23.375
[chuckles]

17:24.209 --> 17:25.043
Nothing.

If you'll look off
to your left for me,

17:30.758 --> 17:32.259
about ten o' clock,

17:32.342 --> 17:33.343
in three...

17:34.178 --> 17:35.053

17:35.888 --> 17:36.722
one.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.019
What is it?

17:42.811 --> 17:44.480
That is Superman.

17:50.319 --> 17:51.195
Where is he going?

17:52.529 --> 17:55.949
He's headed to Q4 105BV.

17:56.033 --> 17:58.786
We've predicted the collapse
of a red dwarf star

17:58.869 --> 18:00.537
near a planet
that might hold life.

18:00.621 --> 18:04.583
When he gets there, he'll try
to counter-act the effects.

18:04.666 --> 18:06.752
Save an entire galaxy
from destruction.

18:12.090 --> 18:13.634
This is what we do.

18:13.717 --> 18:14.968
You'll meet him in person.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.096
Some day.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.185
This way, gentlemen.

18:36.990 --> 18:37.825

18:46.291 --> 18:47.251
Holy shit.

18:49.086 --> 18:51.004
Do we have
to pay for that? [sighs]

18:51.088 --> 18:53.048
No, we actually
needed it fragmented.

18:53.131 --> 18:54.967
This was way cheaper
than lasers.

18:55.050 --> 18:56.093
[sighs in relief]

18:56.176 --> 18:57.970
So, how'd I do?

18:58.053 --> 18:59.888
Well, considering
that was Perithium,

18:59.972 --> 19:02.474
the hardest substance
known to man,

19:02.558 --> 19:05.811
I'd say you did great.

19:05.894 --> 19:08.021
And you have no idea
what this power is

19:08.105 --> 19:09.356
or where it came from?

19:09.439 --> 19:10.649
Well... [sighs]

19:10.732 --> 19:12.568
Apparently, I was born
with it, but...

19:12.651 --> 19:14.403
I just discovered it last week.

19:14.486 --> 19:17.364
Okay. Well, we can try
to identify the nature

19:17.447 --> 19:19.241
of the energy source
you're drawing from.

19:20.117 --> 19:21.869
But I can tell you this.

19:21.952 --> 19:24.496
You've just barely
scratched the surface.

19:25.747 --> 19:29.167
Just now, you've used only 8.1%

19:29.251 --> 19:31.628
of your total
estimated kinetic output.

19:34.590 --> 19:35.591
All right, that's everyone.

19:35.674 --> 19:36.675
You sure
you don't want anything?

19:36.758 --> 19:38.010
No, I'm good.

19:38.093 --> 19:39.469
-All right, let's go.
-Hold on a second.

19:39.553 --> 19:41.054
-Here he is.
-Tim?

19:41.138 --> 19:42.681
When, uh, Mr. Grayson called us

19:42.764 --> 19:45.684
he asked that we design
something especially for you.

19:48.145 --> 19:49.021
[whispers] No.

19:50.564 --> 19:51.565
The Robin Suit?

19:53.400 --> 19:54.234
Yes!

19:54.318 --> 19:55.193
I knew it!

19:56.987 --> 19:58.447
Uh, no.

19:58.530 --> 20:00.991
-That's, uh-- I'm sorry,
it's not the Robin Suit.
-Huh?

20:02.075 --> 20:03.827
-It's not?
-Of course, not.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.871
Are you crazy? You've been
a Titan five minutes.

20:06.413 --> 20:07.539
Oh.

20:07.623 --> 20:08.415
Still something
pretty cool, though.

20:11.293 --> 20:12.127
This...

20:12.836 --> 20:14.087
is a rokushakubo.

20:17.341 --> 20:18.216
It's a Bo staff.

20:23.221 --> 20:25.098
But I don't know
how to use one of these.

20:25.724 --> 20:26.558
Yet.

20:27.351 --> 20:28.268
You're gonna teach me?

20:28.352 --> 20:29.227
Starting tomorrow.

20:33.398 --> 20:34.942
-Thank you.
-Of course.

20:35.025 --> 20:36.276
It's my pleasure.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.903
And, um, should you
ever have any questions,

20:39.363 --> 20:40.447
don't hesitate to ask.

20:42.074 --> 20:42.950
[Dick] Tim?

20:44.409 --> 20:46.495
[Bernard] One more thing.

20:46.578 --> 20:50.082
We did a quick retrofit
of your recreational vehicle

20:50.165 --> 20:51.667
while you were inside.

20:51.750 --> 20:52.668
I hope you don't mind.

saving Gotham city.

21:12.729 --> 21:13.647
I am.

21:13.730 --> 21:15.107
Are we allowed to sit in it?

21:16.066 --> 21:17.317
[Dick] You are.

21:17.401 --> 21:18.944

can start a sign-up sheet.

21:19.736 --> 21:20.737
You can go first.

21:22.739 --> 21:23.615
Where do I sign?

Oh, okay. Got it.

I know this might seem
a bit much,

22:47.657 --> 22:49.576
but how else
was I going to contact you?

22:50.577 --> 22:51.953
I'd like to meet in person.

Come to LexCorp Tower

We have to go back
to Metropolis.

What?

23:24.820 --> 23:26.780
[Kory] All I'm saying is,
it's complicated.

23:27.614 --> 23:29.574
I mean, not really.

He wants me to come
to LexCorp Tower
tonight at 8:00 p.m.

23:32.494 --> 23:34.579
Look, we're talking
about Lex Luthor here.

23:34.663 --> 23:37.290
He's the only man
Bruce Wayne was ever afraid of.

23:37.374 --> 23:39.209
Superman's not afraid of him.

23:39.292 --> 23:40.127
Neither am I.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.545
You should be.

23:41.628 --> 23:43.255
He spent the last 40 years
trying to kill Superman.

23:43.338 --> 23:44.506
He tried to kill you, too.

23:44.589 --> 23:45.632
[Conner] He failed.

23:45.715 --> 23:46.591
He's just a man.

23:47.843 --> 23:49.344
He doesn't have superpowers.

23:50.762 --> 23:51.596
Not all of us do.

23:51.680 --> 23:52.973
[Conner] Dick.

23:53.056 --> 23:54.975
The whole reason
we came to Metropolis

23:55.058 --> 23:57.310
was so that I could meet
one of my parents.

23:57.394 --> 24:00.689
Okay, so it wasn't the one
that I wanted.

24:00.772 --> 24:02.649
Am I supposed
to just ignore him?

24:03.733 --> 24:04.609
Walk away?

24:05.694 --> 24:07.237
No.

24:07.320 --> 24:08.697
You deserve
to know your parents.

24:09.698 --> 24:11.575
Everyone does.

24:11.658 --> 24:14.536
It's just Lex Luthor
never shows his cards.
We don't know what he wants.

24:15.954 --> 24:17.372
Then maybe we should find out.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.542
I mean,
if he is up to something

24:20.625 --> 24:22.085
isn't it better that we know?

24:22.169 --> 24:23.670
The man's a psychopath.

24:23.753 --> 24:25.714
I know. You won't get any
argument from me there, but...

24:27.090 --> 24:29.009
ultimately, it's not
our decision.

24:30.343 --> 24:31.219
It's Conner's.

24:35.891 --> 24:36.766
I wanna meet him.

24:38.685 --> 24:40.145
Okay.

24:40.228 --> 24:42.647
I don't like it, but if it's
gonna happen, Kory's right.

24:42.731 --> 24:44.816
We should get as much
information as we can first.

24:46.568 --> 24:48.987
So, what do we do, call him
and ask for a quick chat?

24:50.739 --> 24:52.490
That's not really my style.

24:52.574 --> 24:53.700
Yeah.

24:53.783 --> 24:54.659
Me neither.

24:56.995 --> 24:57.871
[Kory] Hmm.

25:03.543 --> 25:05.670
[piano music playing on record]

25:15.430 --> 25:16.306
[Lex] Thank you.

Hey, what do you think
you're doing?

26:15.365 --> 26:16.241
[sighs]

26:19.786 --> 26:21.621
Sorry to interrupt your meal.

26:24.541 --> 26:27.711
I would have beamed a message
into your head, but...

26:27.794 --> 26:29.087
this seemed like more fun.

26:33.091 --> 26:34.426
[Starfire exhales]

26:34.509 --> 26:35.969
Well, what a pleasure
to meet you, Starfire.

26:37.053 --> 26:38.722
Or may I call you Koriand'r?

26:39.889 --> 26:41.099
You can call me Kory...

26:41.933 --> 26:43.393
Lex.

26:43.476 --> 26:45.478
May I offer you
some Spaghetti Puttanesca?

26:45.562 --> 26:47.731
-Or perhaps a glass of wine?
-[chuckles]

26:47.814 --> 26:49.399
No, I'm okay. Thank you.

26:51.026 --> 26:52.569
I understand
there've been some...

26:53.445 --> 26:54.779
changes on Tamaran.

26:56.072 --> 26:58.950
Komand'r has now
rightfully taken the throne?

26:59.034 --> 27:00.035
That's right.

27:00.118 --> 27:01.119
And now,

27:01.202 --> 27:02.329
she possesses

27:03.079 --> 27:03.955
the power...

27:05.206 --> 27:06.666
you've always
thought of as your own.

27:07.917 --> 27:10.337
Yes, yes, but, you know,

27:10.420 --> 27:12.130
it's for the best,
really. [sighs]

27:12.213 --> 27:13.048
She's...

27:14.674 --> 27:17.093
She spent her whole life
feeling denied.

27:17.177 --> 27:18.511
Overshadowed.

27:18.595 --> 27:19.471
Less than.

27:22.015 --> 27:24.351
But of course, you wouldn't
know anything about that,
would you?

27:24.434 --> 27:25.310
[chuckles]

27:27.437 --> 27:28.688
We have much to discuss.

27:30.440 --> 27:31.900
This way, please.

27:35.362 --> 27:38.031
[Starfire] What a quaint
little place you have here.

27:38.114 --> 27:39.824
[Lex] Allow me
to show you around.

27:39.908 --> 27:40.825
May I give you a tour?

27:41.618 --> 27:42.535
So far nothing.

27:44.621 --> 27:46.539
Just give her some time.

27:46.623 --> 27:48.708
[Jim] Welcome to
the Daily Planet archives.

27:48.792 --> 27:51.044
Outsiders usually don't get
access to this kind of stuff,

27:51.127 --> 27:54.589
but considering it's you guys,
I'll make an exception.

27:54.672 --> 27:56.508
[Conner] Thanks.

27:56.591 --> 27:58.343
Every single issue dating back
to our very first day
of publication,

27:58.426 --> 28:00.261
November 2nd, 1775.

28:00.345 --> 28:02.013
-[Rachel] This is insane.
-[Jim chuckles]

28:02.097 --> 28:04.307
-[Rachel] How do
you find anything?
-Ah, it's all cataloged.

28:04.391 --> 28:05.433
Well, most of it.

28:05.517 --> 28:06.976
We're digitizing
as fast as we can.

28:07.060 --> 28:08.728
The Luthor section
is just down there.

28:08.812 --> 28:11.398
According to Dick,
Lex Luthor never tips his hand.

28:11.481 --> 28:12.941
So, we need to see
what cards he's showing

28:13.024 --> 28:14.692
and then try to figure out
what he's holding.

28:14.776 --> 28:16.569
Okay, so we'll need everything
you've got on him.

28:16.653 --> 28:18.863
Everything? I mean,
that could take months
to go through.

28:18.947 --> 28:21.032
[chuckles] Don't worry.
He's a fast reader.

28:21.116 --> 28:24.077
I mean,
I believe you, but still.
Can we narrow it down?

28:24.160 --> 28:26.287
I mean,
we got a lot on the guy.

28:27.038 --> 28:28.164
We got...

28:28.248 --> 28:31.126
Felony arrests,
felony convictions,

28:31.209 --> 28:34.045
capital crimes,
crimes on the high seas,

28:34.129 --> 28:36.005
space-based crimes,
philanthropy.

28:36.089 --> 28:37.173
Oh, definitely the pirate--

28:37.257 --> 28:38.967
-Philanthropy.
-Philanthropy.

28:39.050 --> 28:40.635
-Philanthropy.
-[Jim] Okay.

28:40.718 --> 28:42.846
Let's head to my office.
We can pull it up
on the server.

28:53.898 --> 28:55.316
[sinister music playing]

29:03.783 --> 29:04.701
[Lex] Powerful, isn't it?

29:08.913 --> 29:11.458
Gautier 1762.

29:11.541 --> 29:13.835
I acquired this bottle
at auction.

29:13.918 --> 29:18.298
It was found in the sealed-off
compartment underneath
Jean Paul Marat's bathtub.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.843
-It tastes like it.
-[chuckles]

29:21.926 --> 29:23.845
-To new friends.
-[scoffs] We'll see.

29:25.889 --> 29:27.390
[Lex] I have so many questions
for you.

29:27.474 --> 29:29.851
So much I want to learn
about your planet,

29:29.934 --> 29:31.853
history, your abilities.

29:31.936 --> 29:34.689
I have a few questions
for you, too.

29:34.772 --> 29:37.317
Why do you want
to meet with Conner?

29:37.400 --> 29:40.361
Doesn't a father have
a right to meet his son?

29:40.445 --> 29:42.363
[Starfire] A desire
doesn't equal a right.

29:47.535 --> 29:49.537
It worked. Unbelievable.

29:49.621 --> 29:53.166
The unbelievable thing
about Bruce's toys is
never that they work.

29:53.249 --> 29:54.834
It's what they do.

29:54.918 --> 29:59.047
I got personal, medical,
financial, schedules,
calendars.

29:59.130 --> 30:01.925
[chuckles] Hell, I've even got
his Twitter account.

30:02.008 --> 30:02.926
What do you want?

30:03.009 --> 30:04.344
I want Conner to stay with me.

30:04.427 --> 30:05.470
Here in Metropolis.

30:06.429 --> 30:07.680
[Starfire chuckles]

30:07.764 --> 30:10.266
No, no. That's...
that's never gonna happen.

30:10.350 --> 30:11.226
[Lex] It might.

30:13.144 --> 30:14.187
After all,

30:14.270 --> 30:15.522
it is his decision.

30:15.605 --> 30:17.899
He knows who you are.

30:17.982 --> 30:20.401
-What you are.
-That's exactly the point.

30:20.485 --> 30:21.361
He doesn't.

30:24.697 --> 30:28.910
I wanna give him the benefit
of my knowledge and guidance.

30:30.286 --> 30:32.330
And I want him
to be prepared to one day...

30:33.623 --> 30:37.085
take over
as President of LexCorp.

30:37.168 --> 30:39.170
[Starfire] You know
what I think?

30:39.254 --> 30:41.631
I think what you really want

30:41.714 --> 30:44.634
is to own
the thing you created.

30:44.717 --> 30:46.761
You consider Conner
your possession.

30:47.804 --> 30:48.680
He is not.

30:50.807 --> 30:51.849
He has compassion,

30:52.642 --> 30:53.768
empathy,

30:53.851 --> 30:55.436
moral intelligence.

30:55.520 --> 30:58.856
All of which make him
far stronger than you.

30:58.940 --> 31:00.191
In every way.

31:00.275 --> 31:02.944
You want him
to be your personal weapon.

31:03.027 --> 31:04.195
He will never be that.

31:07.323 --> 31:09.284
Isn't that exactly...

31:09.367 --> 31:10.285
how you're using him...

31:11.452 --> 31:12.287
Richard?

31:14.998 --> 31:17.041
Hasn't Bruce taught you
any other way?

31:24.090 --> 31:25.466
[door opens]

31:25.550 --> 31:26.968
I'd like you to meet
some friends of mine.

31:29.762 --> 31:30.763
Remember, Richard,

31:31.472 --> 31:32.348
this is me...

31:33.308 --> 31:34.183
being gentle.

31:41.816 --> 31:43.401
Tim, stay down.

31:48.156 --> 31:49.282

31:49.365 --> 31:50.241
Ninjas.

[breathing heavily]

32:24.067 --> 32:25.318
You good?

32:25.401 --> 32:26.277
I hate ninjas.

32:31.574 --> 32:32.450
[sighs wearily]

32:33.409 --> 32:34.827
More ninjas.

32:34.911 --> 32:35.995
[sighs] Okay.

33:49.652 --> 33:50.820
I liked those men.

33:53.448 --> 33:55.992
All I ask is six months.

33:56.075 --> 33:58.411
If you believe
you know Conner's answer,

33:58.494 --> 34:00.997
then you'll have no problem
conveying my offer.

34:03.666 --> 34:06.085
I expect an answer tonight.

34:06.169 --> 34:07.712
-[Nightwing sighs] Let's go.
-All right.

34:08.755 --> 34:10.590
[siren wailing distantly]

34:14.010 --> 34:16.053
Here you go.
The Luthor Foundation.

34:16.137 --> 34:20.099
"Just announced 18 months ago,
Luthor Foundation recently
broke ground on

34:20.183 --> 34:21.768
a dozen hospitals and schools."

34:21.851 --> 34:25.980
Scholarships, research grants,
charities all over the world.

34:26.063 --> 34:28.274
Funded at
over a billion dollars.

34:28.357 --> 34:29.567
He seems serious.

34:29.650 --> 34:31.277
There's one thing
I know about Lex.

34:31.360 --> 34:32.278
He's always serious.

34:33.988 --> 34:34.864
Where's Rachel?

34:40.119 --> 34:41.496
[eerie music playing]

34:53.925 --> 34:54.759
[grunts]

35:17.490 --> 35:18.324
-Rachel.
-[gasps]

35:18.407 --> 35:19.575
[panting]

35:19.659 --> 35:20.785
What are you doing?

35:22.119 --> 35:22.995
I don't know.

35:23.996 --> 35:24.872
[Rachel exhales]

35:26.666 --> 35:27.959
Gar...

35:28.042 --> 35:30.002
I think something terrible
is about to happen.

35:35.842 --> 35:37.093
I need to get out of here.

35:37.176 --> 35:39.262
We should not have
come back to Metropolis.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.557
Who is this guy?

35:42.640 --> 35:44.141
He's in a lot
of these photographs.

35:44.225 --> 35:45.685
Uh, I don't know.

35:45.768 --> 35:47.687
I can't find his name anywhere.

35:47.770 --> 35:49.438
Maybe he works
for the foundation.

35:49.522 --> 35:51.190
[Conner] Even bigger question.

35:51.274 --> 35:54.318
Why does Luthor suddenly
have a charitable
foundation, anyway?

35:54.402 --> 35:55.361
[Dick] Because he's dying.

35:56.279 --> 35:57.363
What?

35:57.446 --> 35:58.865
Lex Luthor
has six months to live.

36:00.074 --> 36:01.325
What are you talking about?

36:01.409 --> 36:03.536
He wants you to stay with him.

36:03.619 --> 36:05.288
Learn how to run LexCorp.

36:05.371 --> 36:07.498
Learn about him
while you still can.

36:07.582 --> 36:08.958
How do you know all this?

36:09.041 --> 36:11.752
Oh, I let one of these
loose in his penthouse.

36:11.836 --> 36:13.421
It's a superbug from WayneTech.

36:14.589 --> 36:16.215
It hacked into Lex's files

36:16.299 --> 36:18.050
and revealed multiple visits
to medical clinics

36:18.134 --> 36:19.552
all around the world.

36:19.635 --> 36:22.722
This guy right here,
his name is Arthur Holmwood.

36:22.805 --> 36:25.808
He's the world's leading expert
in kryptonite poisoning.

36:27.018 --> 36:29.395
Luthor was diagnosed
two years ago.

36:29.478 --> 36:30.438
And there's no cure.

36:31.689 --> 36:33.107
This changes things.

36:33.190 --> 36:34.692
It does.

36:34.775 --> 36:36.444
We think Lex wants to use you
as a way of saving himself.

36:36.527 --> 36:39.071
Holmwood created a theory.
It's called, um,

36:39.155 --> 36:41.115
radical mass transfusions.

36:41.199 --> 36:42.825
-[Conner whispers] Radical
mass transfusions.
-[Kory] It's blood, organs,

36:42.909 --> 36:43.784
everything.

36:45.077 --> 36:47.246
You're the closest
living genetic match.

36:47.330 --> 36:49.415
Your body's
obviously stronger than his.

36:49.498 --> 36:51.751
There might be a way
he can use it to fight
his disease.

36:53.836 --> 36:55.296
Okay. Uh...

36:55.379 --> 36:56.923
A blood transfusion.

36:57.006 --> 36:58.591
People get those
all the time, right?

36:58.674 --> 37:00.676
If that's all he's asking...

37:00.760 --> 37:03.137
Conner. You can't be serious.

37:05.514 --> 37:06.390
Can we talk?

37:09.101 --> 37:11.228
A dying man
is like a cornered animal.

37:11.312 --> 37:13.105
That's when
they're most dangerous.

37:13.189 --> 37:15.733
Listen, Conner, at the end
of the day, it's up to you.

37:15.816 --> 37:17.151
But if my opinion
means anything,

37:17.234 --> 37:18.861
I wouldn't get
within a mile of Lex Luthor.

37:18.945 --> 37:20.571
[Conner] I hear you.

37:20.655 --> 37:22.573
But you're the one who told me
I deserved to know my parents.

37:23.699 --> 37:25.493
Maybe he's a terrible person.

37:25.576 --> 37:27.078
But I have to find that out
for myself.

37:27.995 --> 37:29.163
And I have to know it

37:29.246 --> 37:30.665
before I can know
what to do about it.

37:30.748 --> 37:32.083
You don't owe him anything.

37:32.166 --> 37:33.417
Maybe he owes me something.

37:34.126 --> 37:35.086
Like what?

37:35.169 --> 37:36.629
Answers.

37:36.712 --> 37:37.588
Why was I created?

37:38.547 --> 37:39.423
For what purpose?

37:40.383 --> 37:42.218
I understand. Trust me.

37:43.302 --> 37:45.137
But none of that
matters to him.

37:45.221 --> 37:46.514
His purpose is not yours.

37:47.890 --> 37:49.100
I still need to find out.

37:52.395 --> 37:53.729
I can't tell you what to do.

37:55.106 --> 37:56.774
I can tell you this.

37:56.857 --> 37:57.942
You're a part of our family.

37:59.110 --> 37:59.986
And if you leave,

38:01.487 --> 38:02.405
it's gonna hurt us.

38:05.366 --> 38:06.200
I know.

38:07.910 --> 38:08.869
I'm sorry, Dick.

38:11.080 --> 38:12.123
But I have to do this.

38:14.750 --> 38:15.626
[sighs]

38:24.135 --> 38:25.469
I hate Lex Luthor.

38:26.345 --> 38:27.972
Yeah, I hate him, too.

38:29.849 --> 38:31.809
I know Conner needs to do this.

38:32.893 --> 38:34.395
For his own personal growth.

38:35.688 --> 38:36.731
I needed it, too.

38:38.691 --> 38:41.235
It's a painful thing,
not knowing where
you come from.

38:43.404 --> 38:45.072
But people like Lex Luthor...

38:47.616 --> 38:49.160
they only destroy things.

38:51.370 --> 38:53.247
Like you said,
it's Conner's choice.

38:55.291 --> 38:56.709
I just hope
he made the right one.

38:59.795 --> 39:00.671
[sighs]

39:07.470 --> 39:08.763
[suspenseful music playing]

39:21.984 --> 39:22.818
Mr. Luthor?

39:27.490 --> 39:28.365
I'm Conner Kent.

39:37.958 --> 39:39.418
[Lex exhales]

39:39.502 --> 39:40.377
You took his name.

39:42.379 --> 39:45.257
I understand
you came to Metropolis
at his invitation.

39:46.425 --> 39:47.259
So?

39:48.302 --> 39:49.762
How was it?

39:49.845 --> 39:52.139
Meeting the great Man of Steel?

39:52.223 --> 39:53.182
[Conner] I didn't meet him.

39:53.891 --> 39:56.393
He was... away.

39:56.477 --> 39:59.230
Oh. That must have been
devastating for you.

40:00.981 --> 40:02.858
Well, I hope I'm not too much
of a disappointment.

40:02.942 --> 40:05.111
And I suppose you're...

40:05.194 --> 40:07.905
-probably wondering
exactly why--
-I'm not.

40:07.988 --> 40:10.032
I'm not wondering
why you invited me here.

40:10.116 --> 40:11.367
I don't care.

40:11.450 --> 40:12.701
I'm here
because of what I want.

40:14.161 --> 40:15.996
Putting your own desires first.

40:20.209 --> 40:21.335
Like father, like son.

40:26.006 --> 40:28.425
I want you to know that I don't
consider you my father.

40:29.385 --> 40:30.886
[Lex] I see.

40:30.970 --> 40:32.096
[Conner] Are you dying?

40:35.099 --> 40:36.267
Perhaps.

40:36.350 --> 40:37.685
Were you hoping
to use me for a cure?

40:37.768 --> 40:38.602
[snaps fingers]

40:38.686 --> 40:39.562
Splendid idea.

40:41.564 --> 40:42.439
I already tried.

40:45.568 --> 40:47.653
I have an ample supply
of the genetic material

40:47.736 --> 40:49.864
it took to create you.

40:49.947 --> 40:52.324
It follows that a treatment
might be found there...

40:55.578 --> 40:56.453
Didn't work.

40:57.371 --> 40:58.372
However,

40:58.455 --> 40:59.832
I do owe you an apology.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.084
For what?

41:02.168 --> 41:03.627
[Lex] For creating you
in my image.

41:04.420 --> 41:05.421
If people found out,

41:07.256 --> 41:08.757
they would see you
as partly me.

41:08.841 --> 41:10.676
Well, they love you now.

41:10.759 --> 41:12.553
But all it would take
is one mistake.

41:13.262 --> 41:14.930
And then...

41:15.014 --> 41:16.307
they will see you differently.

41:17.516 --> 41:18.517
I don't have to listen to this.

41:18.601 --> 41:19.894
No, you don't. But you should.

41:19.977 --> 41:22.104
Because I'm the only person
in the world

41:22.188 --> 41:23.772
who can truly understand you.

41:23.856 --> 41:25.149
The only one

41:25.232 --> 41:27.359
who will never judge you
for being what you are.

41:28.360 --> 41:29.236
How could I?

41:30.571 --> 41:31.822
I created you.

41:31.906 --> 41:32.781
[Conner] Why?

41:34.283 --> 41:35.284
Why did you create me?

41:36.952 --> 41:38.537
Am I to assume

41:38.621 --> 41:40.789
that your decision
on whether or not to stay

41:40.873 --> 41:43.500
rests on my answer
to this question?

41:45.628 --> 41:46.503
Very well.

41:52.718 --> 41:55.471
I created you...
for one reason.

41:57.139 --> 42:00.351
To see my dream
of becoming Superman come true.

42:03.145 --> 42:07.066
Please understand,
I realized many years ago

42:07.149 --> 42:09.443
that I, myself,

42:09.527 --> 42:12.488
could never
become Superman, so...

42:12.571 --> 42:15.157
I went about achieving
my personal dream
the way men have

42:15.241 --> 42:16.867
since the beginning
of humanity.

42:18.953 --> 42:19.828
I had a son.

42:22.248 --> 42:24.333
My dream was that...

42:24.416 --> 42:26.752
my child would succeed
where I had not.

42:28.212 --> 42:29.046
To be...

42:30.965 --> 42:32.633
both man and Superman.

42:35.511 --> 42:36.387
Did I succeed?

42:38.305 --> 42:39.974
Maybe you should tell me.

42:40.057 --> 42:41.809
[Lex] I see what Superman
has given you.

42:42.810 --> 42:44.770
So does the world.

42:44.853 --> 42:47.398
You show them
with your actions every day.

42:47.481 --> 42:48.816
But what I have given you...

42:51.318 --> 42:52.403
expresses itself...

42:54.530 --> 42:55.406
more subtly.

42:56.865 --> 42:58.117
And I admit,

42:58.200 --> 43:00.286
it is pride and self-regard,
and what I'm sure

43:00.369 --> 43:03.789
the television psychologists
would call "narcissism"

43:03.872 --> 43:06.083
that has driven me
to want this meeting.

43:06.166 --> 43:07.626
To want my time with you.

43:07.710 --> 43:10.713
To give you some part
of myself and not just my DNA,

43:12.881 --> 43:14.591
but my real actual thoughts.

43:17.386 --> 43:18.220
My thesis.

43:25.227 --> 43:26.061
Conner.

43:29.732 --> 43:31.191
I don't want you to become me.

43:31.275 --> 43:32.276
I've already done that.

43:33.360 --> 43:34.611
What I want is for you...

43:35.529 --> 43:36.697
with all your gifts...

43:38.991 --> 43:39.867
to know me.

43:41.744 --> 43:42.828
And with that knowledge,

43:44.079 --> 43:45.998
choose for yourself,

43:46.081 --> 43:46.999
what and who...

43:47.625 --> 43:48.500
you will be.

43:51.462 --> 43:54.214
Now I've answered
your questions,

43:54.298 --> 43:56.216
please allow me
the only one I have.

43:58.719 --> 43:59.595
Will you stay?

44:01.263 --> 44:02.348
[exhales softly]

44:05.643 --> 44:06.477
Yes.

44:08.228 --> 44:09.063
I will.

44:10.647 --> 44:11.523
Excellent.

44:12.941 --> 44:15.152
I have something
I wanna share with you.

44:15.235 --> 44:17.196
A project I've been working on.

44:17.279 --> 44:20.366
The reason why death
may no longer be the foe

44:20.449 --> 44:21.533
I once thought it to be.

44:22.659 --> 44:23.660
But there's problems.

44:25.954 --> 44:27.289
My partners may have...

44:28.665 --> 44:30.334
even darker ideas than I do.

44:33.128 --> 44:34.129
I may need your help.

44:39.176 --> 44:40.135
[coughs]

44:46.308 --> 44:48.727
[coughing]

44:49.436 --> 44:52.481
[chokes and gags]

44:56.068 --> 44:57.528
[coughing]

45:02.533 --> 45:04.076
[continues coughing]

45:25.597 --> 45:26.807
[gags]

45:26.890 --> 45:27.850
[Conner] Mr. Luthor?

45:28.434 --> 45:29.268
[coughs]

45:29.935 --> 45:31.520
[coughing]

45:35.065 --> 45:35.941
Are you okay?

45:36.024 --> 45:37.067
[vomits]

45:38.902 --> 45:41.071
I actually
hate tomatoes, Raven.

45:42.281 --> 45:43.115
Gross.

45:45.868 --> 45:47.661
-[chokes]
-[Gar] You okay?

45:49.037 --> 45:51.123
[retching]

45:51.957 --> 45:53.125
[coughing]

45:54.251 --> 45:55.335
[Conner] Lex!

45:55.419 --> 45:56.295
Lex!

45:56.378 --> 45:58.422

46:11.351 --> 46:12.769

46:30.746 --> 46:32.498

-[Gar] Dick!

46:32.581 --> 46:34.791
[Rachel screaming]

46:34.875 --> 46:36.001
Rachel!

46:36.627 --> 46:37.461
[gasps]

46:42.925 --> 46:43.800
What happened?

46:48.013 --> 46:50.098
[breathing heavily]

46:57.773 --> 46:58.774
Lex.

46:58.857 --> 46:59.691
Lex.

47:01.360 --> 47:03.946
-[gun cocking]
-Down! Down! Now!

47:04.029 --> 47:06.240
Show me your hands!
Get away from him!

47:08.283 --> 47:09.993
I said show me your hands!

47:13.121 --> 47:14.373
Watch his eyes.

47:14.456 --> 47:17.376
[breath trembling]

47:23.006 --> 47:23.840
[scoffs]

47:25.133 --> 47:26.009
[chuckles softly]

47:28.345 --> 47:29.680
You see, Mr. Luthor...

47:32.307 --> 47:33.225
someone...

47:34.101 --> 47:35.227
always pays.

47:39.356 --> 47:40.691
[chuckles]

47:51.243 --> 47:53.328
[theme music playing]
