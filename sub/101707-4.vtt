about something.

38:32.353 --> 38:35.356
It'll only take a minute.

38:35.400 --> 38:37.358
Why don't you come through?

38:39.665 --> 38:41.928
Have a seat.

38:45.192 --> 38:48.935
You know, when I was
finding your hat the other day,

38:48.978 --> 38:51.111
it brought me back.

38:51.154 --> 38:53.592
My father, he had one
just like it.

38:53.635 --> 38:55.855
And the two of you...

38:55.898 --> 38:58.814
Yeah, the two of you
might have served together.

39:00.686 --> 39:03.123
- Knew a lot of good men.

39:03.166 --> 39:06.431
- He always used to take me
to those picnics.

39:06.474 --> 39:07.606
Had to drag me.

39:07.649 --> 39:09.259
I acted like
I'd rather be anywhere else,

39:09.303 --> 39:12.741
but do you remember
those flag football games?

39:14.569 --> 39:16.397
Well, he signed us up
every year.

39:16.441 --> 39:18.965
It was the only part of the day
where we didn't argue,

39:19.008 --> 39:23.404
but he always made sure
that I got to score.

39:27.626 --> 39:30.846
Now I know why
he wanted me there with him.

39:32.326 --> 39:34.459
Those memories,

39:34.502 --> 39:36.417
they're all I have left.

39:38.071 --> 39:41.509
Now, I know this house
is special to you, Henry,

39:41.553 --> 39:43.772
but you can't
come back here anymore.

39:43.816 --> 39:45.600
- It's my home--
- I know.

39:45.644 --> 39:47.123
You're right.
It was.

39:47.167 --> 39:50.039
But your wife,
she's worried for you.

39:51.214 --> 39:53.565
- Lois.

39:53.608 --> 39:55.480
She takes real good care of me.

39:55.523 --> 39:57.003
- Yeah.

39:57.046 --> 40:01.703
So why don't we
get you back to her?

40:14.934 --> 40:18.024
[whispering]
Yeah, come on.

40:20.200 --> 40:22.202
- Keep this.

40:22.245 --> 40:25.423
- That's all right.
- Take it.

40:26.772 --> 40:28.861
A reminder.
