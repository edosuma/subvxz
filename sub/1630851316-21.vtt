WEBVTT

00:07.703 --> 00:08.486
Pastry, anyone?

00:08.530 --> 00:10.358
I can find

00:10.401 --> 00:11.794
the best international pastry
in any town.

00:11.837 --> 00:12.925
You're a bird-watcher?

00:12.969 --> 00:14.057
Hidden talent.

00:14.101 --> 00:15.537
Was this in his record?

00:15.580 --> 00:17.147
No. But we only know his record

00:17.191 --> 00:19.062
from as far back as he was
with the FBI.

00:19.106 --> 00:20.759
We don't know
what he was doing before then.

00:20.803 --> 00:22.283
Just thinking if you didn't have
anything to do tonight

00:22.326 --> 00:24.241
that maybe you wanted
to go to a wedding

00:24.285 --> 00:26.417
with me as my plus-one.

00:26.461 --> 00:28.028
I'd love to go, yeah.

00:28.071 --> 00:29.203
These are from that, uh,
wedding you went to

00:29.246 --> 00:30.682
last month. It looks like

00:30.726 --> 00:32.380
you and Jimmy
had a fun time.

00:32.423 --> 00:34.034
Jess, I really like you.

00:34.077 --> 00:35.470
So, there's this
new coffee shop

00:35.513 --> 00:37.124
a couple of blocks from here.

00:37.167 --> 00:39.256
You want to check it out?

00:47.699 --> 00:49.179
Hey there, gorgeous.

00:51.442 --> 00:52.617
Damn.

00:58.188 --> 00:59.929
Where'd you go,
you little pecker?

01:06.240 --> 01:07.284
Hey there, gorgeous.

01:08.677 --> 01:12.289
Oh, shake those tail feathers.

01:23.518 --> 01:25.259
Get, get off!

02:23.186 --> 02:25.797
All I need is the incoming
routing number. See,

02:25.841 --> 02:27.277
I'm filling out disclosure forms
for my job,

02:27.321 --> 02:28.974
and I need to explain
a $10,000 deposit

02:29.018 --> 02:31.542
into my account.

02:31.586 --> 02:35.894
No, it was actually a, uh,
a gift from my former boss.

02:35.938 --> 02:38.114
No. No, I do not want to b...

02:39.115 --> 02:41.291
I'm on hold.

02:41.335 --> 02:44.686
I swear, filling out these
HR forms is a waste of time.

02:44.729 --> 02:46.992
Tell me about it. I have
to disclose that my father

02:47.036 --> 02:48.907
is a foreign spy
and that I can't find him.

02:48.951 --> 02:51.171
Gracias.

02:51.214 --> 02:52.955
McKnight doesn't seem to
be making much headway either.

02:52.998 --> 02:54.609
She's been on the phone
for 45 minutes.

02:54.652 --> 02:56.219
Did you say my name?

02:56.263 --> 02:58.003
Oh, we're just saying
that having to list

02:58.047 --> 02:59.179
all your potential
conflicts of interest

02:59.222 --> 03:00.615
is just such a pain in the ass.

03:00.658 --> 03:02.530
Oh.
I didn't think it was too bad.

03:02.573 --> 03:05.185
My dad works
for the NCIS Far East office,

03:05.228 --> 03:07.709
so disclosing his current
contact info was easy.

03:07.752 --> 03:09.537
Then why are you still
on the phone?

03:09.580 --> 03:12.148
- I like talking to my dad.
- Oh.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.759
Morning, everyone.
I have those extra HR forms.

03:14.803 --> 03:15.760
- For who?
- For who?

03:15.804 --> 03:17.849
For Agent Parker.

03:17.893 --> 03:20.330
He left a message this morning
saying he needed extra space.

03:20.374 --> 03:22.027
Six-page form wasn't enough?

03:25.161 --> 03:27.207
Okay. Love you.

03:34.997 --> 03:37.434
Dude, this is, like,
60 more pages.

03:37.478 --> 03:40.829
How many conflicts of interest
could one man possibly have?

03:40.872 --> 03:42.961
Well, his friend in Philly
is a known felon.

03:43.005 --> 03:45.616
Maybe Parker has
other questionable relationships

03:45.660 --> 03:46.965
he needs to disclose.

03:47.009 --> 03:48.576
Either that or he's dating

03:48.619 --> 03:50.360
the entire
NCIS accounting department.

03:50.404 --> 03:52.057
Oh, come on,
that's a rumor. Right?

03:53.494 --> 03:55.235
Well, clearly there's a lot
about Parker we don't know.

03:57.976 --> 04:00.240
Well, I say we find out.

04:00.283 --> 04:02.764
You can't read his HR forms.

04:02.807 --> 04:04.505
Those are supposed
to be private.

04:04.548 --> 04:07.116
Well, then he shouldn't have
left them in the public.

04:09.336 --> 04:12.861
Oh, whoa! Okay,
I did not touch anything.

04:12.904 --> 04:16.168
No, no. A Bandium notification
from Kasie.

04:16.212 --> 04:17.779
Well, why so loud?

04:17.822 --> 04:19.041
Probably 'cause
it says "emergency."

04:19.084 --> 04:20.999
Well, that can't be good.

04:21.043 --> 04:22.523
Mc
Hey, Kase.

04:22.566 --> 04:24.002
- Got your message.
- Yeah, your very loud message.

04:24.046 --> 04:26.222
Sorry. Emergency Bandiums

04:26.266 --> 04:28.224
override
internal volume controls.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.094
So, what's the emergency?

04:29.138 --> 04:32.010
Ah. This.

04:32.054 --> 04:33.403
These photos were emailed

04:33.447 --> 04:35.275
to the NCIS tip line
this morning.

04:35.318 --> 04:36.928
Did these birds commit a crime?

04:36.972 --> 04:38.408
Uh, no, but someone did.

04:41.150 --> 04:42.282
Well, that's creepy.

04:42.325 --> 04:44.022
It gets even creepier.

04:45.676 --> 04:46.416
Whoa.

04:51.029 --> 04:54.946
- Are these real?
- Uh, I already confirmed the image data integrity.

04:54.990 --> 04:57.166
These photos have not
been altered in any way.

04:57.209 --> 04:59.255
Mc
So this kidnapping
actually happened.

04:59.299 --> 05:00.691
So, who's our victim?

05:00.735 --> 05:02.171
Yeah, and who sent these photos?

05:02.214 --> 05:04.739
Still tracing
the anonymous email,

05:04.782 --> 05:06.958
and facial recognition hasn't
come back on the jogger yet.

05:07.002 --> 05:08.003
Anything
on her license plate?

05:08.046 --> 05:09.744
I was only able to get

05:09.787 --> 05:11.441
a partial number.
I'm running

05:11.485 --> 05:12.442
against make and
model now to get a...

05:13.791 --> 05:15.184
Oh, there it is.

05:16.141 --> 05:18.013
The vehicle is registered

05:18.056 --> 05:19.754
to a Vivian Kolchak.

05:19.797 --> 05:22.147
- Same hair, same face.
- That's our jogger.

05:22.191 --> 05:24.019
What's the emergency, Kasie?

05:24.062 --> 05:25.281
Whoa.

05:26.500 --> 05:27.501
What's she doing up there?

05:28.980 --> 05:31.200
What, you-you
know this woman?

05:31.243 --> 05:33.289
Does this have something to do
with my disclosure forms?

05:33.333 --> 05:34.159
We didn't touch those.

05:34.203 --> 05:35.770
Yeah?

05:35.813 --> 05:38.468
Then why is my ex-wife
on the screen?

05:47.782 --> 05:49.436
Thanks, Janet.
If you hear from her,

05:49.479 --> 05:51.046
let me know right away, okay?

05:51.089 --> 05:52.700
Poor guy.

05:52.743 --> 05:54.136
Watching his ex-wife
get kidnapped

05:54.179 --> 05:56.138
- really messed him up.
- Well,

05:56.181 --> 05:57.444
ex or not, he obviously
still cares about her.

05:59.446 --> 06:01.099
KNIGHT:Well, here's what
we know so far.

06:01.143 --> 06:03.319
Vivian Kolchak, formerly

06:03.363 --> 06:05.626
a special agent at the FBI.

06:05.669 --> 06:07.410
Just like Parker.
Maybe that's where they met.

06:07.454 --> 06:10.587
File just says they married
in '97, divorced in '05,

06:10.631 --> 06:13.285
citing
irreconcilable differences.

06:13.329 --> 06:14.896
Well, that could mean anything.

06:14.939 --> 06:16.767
Well, after the divorce,
Vivian left the FBI

06:16.811 --> 06:18.073
for a job
at the Defense Department,

06:18.116 --> 06:19.988
where she is now...

06:20.031 --> 06:23.557
the head of the Unidentified
Aerial Phenomena Task Force.

06:23.600 --> 06:24.949
That sounds like UFOs.

06:24.993 --> 06:26.516
It is UFOs.

06:26.560 --> 06:27.778
They investigate
reported sightings.

06:27.822 --> 06:28.910
It's the real deal.

06:28.953 --> 06:30.564
It's very <i>X-Files.</i>

06:30.607 --> 06:33.349
You think Parker married
the real-life Agent Mulder?

06:33.393 --> 06:36.134
Might explain why he needed
- those extra disclosure forms.
I confirmed

06:36.178 --> 06:38.441
that Viv's cell phone is off
and nobody's heard from her.

06:38.485 --> 06:40.182
We need to find her, like, now!

06:40.225 --> 06:41.575
Mc
Well, we, uh...

06:41.618 --> 06:43.751
we don't have a lot
to go on so far.

06:43.794 --> 06:45.056
According to Kasie,

06:45.100 --> 06:47.058
the kidnapping photos
are a dead end.

06:47.102 --> 06:48.451
Mc
Yeah, no identifiable landmarks,

06:48.495 --> 06:51.019
and the metadata
has been erased.

06:51.062 --> 06:53.848
So we don't know when or where
the actual crime took place.

06:53.891 --> 06:57.373
And the sender used
a burner email address

06:57.417 --> 06:59.680
and a secure VPN,
so no way to backtrace.

06:59.723 --> 07:01.421
- So, what <i>do</i> we know?
- TORRES:Well,

07:01.464 --> 07:03.248
we know that whoever sent
those photos

07:03.292 --> 07:05.425
wanted you to see them.

07:05.468 --> 07:07.514
I mean, clearly
they-they know you.

07:07.557 --> 07:10.299
Bird-watching, ex-wife, NCIS.

07:10.342 --> 07:12.127
Why send them at all?

07:12.170 --> 07:13.781
Obviously to taunt you.

07:13.824 --> 07:17.088
Any enemies you'd like
to disclose, Parker?

07:17.132 --> 07:20.875
It's a long list, so let's focus
on finding the crime scene.

07:20.918 --> 07:23.181
Maybe the kidnappers
left something behind

07:23.225 --> 07:24.661
we can use to trace them with.

07:24.705 --> 07:26.576
Do you know
where Vivian likes to run?

07:26.620 --> 07:28.535
No, but knowing her,
she probably told someone.

07:28.578 --> 07:30.928
She may spend
most of her time

07:30.972 --> 07:32.539
staring up at the sky
looking for little green men,

07:32.582 --> 07:34.671
but she's also very practical.

07:34.715 --> 07:36.847
Okay, the phone records
just came through.

07:36.891 --> 07:39.459
Vivian's last call
was this morning

07:39.502 --> 07:41.591
to a Fairfax Senior Living Home.

07:41.635 --> 07:44.420
You got to be kidding me.

07:44.464 --> 07:46.030
Does Vivian have
family there?

07:46.074 --> 07:49.120
Not exactly.

07:49.164 --> 07:51.209
<i>So, your ex-wife</i> <i>
still calls your dad?</i>

07:51.253 --> 07:52.428
Viv's a people person.

07:52.472 --> 07:54.517
This place
is nicer than mine.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.519
Well, my brothers and
sisters all have careers

07:56.563 --> 07:57.564
that take them
around the world,

07:57.607 --> 07:59.391
so I offered
to move Dad in here.

07:59.435 --> 08:01.350
I'm sure he appreciates it.

08:01.393 --> 08:04.745
He appreciates that I come over
once a week for a game of Risk.

08:04.788 --> 08:07.661
Is that the one where
you conquer the world?

08:07.704 --> 08:09.663
Dad likes to go to war.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.624
- Is there a problem?
- Look,

08:14.668 --> 08:16.321
I love my dad, but
just a heads-up,

08:16.365 --> 08:18.410
we don't always get along.

08:18.454 --> 08:20.587
<i>This is all your fault.</i>

08:20.630 --> 08:23.111
You never should've
let Vivian get away.

08:23.154 --> 08:25.069
What does our divorce have to do
with her being kidnapped?

08:25.113 --> 08:27.071
I don't know, Detective.
You tell me.

08:27.115 --> 08:29.683
Dad, we just need to
know what Viv said

08:29.726 --> 08:31.293
when she called
this morning.

08:31.336 --> 08:33.251
She asked if she could drop off

08:33.295 --> 08:34.949
some fresh pecan bars.

08:34.992 --> 08:36.733
I said hell yes.
You know that woman

08:36.777 --> 08:38.387
- can bake.
- PARKER:Yeah.

08:38.430 --> 08:39.736
But I don't know why
she still bakes for you.

08:39.780 --> 08:41.869
Because she's a damn saint.

08:41.912 --> 08:43.261
Mr. Parker
And divorcing her

08:43.305 --> 08:44.915
was an affront to God.

08:44.959 --> 08:46.395
Mr. Parker,

08:46.438 --> 08:47.570
are you saying that Vivian

08:47.614 --> 08:49.311
was actually here this morning?

08:49.354 --> 08:51.182
Yeah, i-it's Roman. And yeah.

08:51.226 --> 08:53.663
She, uh,
she dropped off the pecan bars

08:53.707 --> 08:55.709
right before I went
to hot yoga at 8:00.

08:55.752 --> 08:58.929
Well, did she say anything?
Was she acting strangely?

08:58.973 --> 09:00.627
Pecan bar, hon?

09:00.670 --> 09:02.367
Uh...

09:02.411 --> 09:05.719
I suggest, uh,
one of the chewy edge pieces.

09:05.762 --> 09:06.981
Uh, thank you.

09:07.024 --> 09:08.504
ROMAN:Yeah.

09:08.548 --> 09:09.461
Uh, by the way,
did you know my son

09:09.505 --> 09:11.725
- is an ex-con?
- Dad.

09:11.768 --> 09:15.555
You know, he may have mentioned
that he went to juvie once,

09:15.598 --> 09:17.121
but that was a long time ago.

09:17.165 --> 09:18.253
I'll never forget it.

09:18.296 --> 09:19.689
Clearly.

09:19.733 --> 09:21.125
And I think
that's all in his past,

09:21.169 --> 09:22.126
because look at your son now.

09:22.170 --> 09:24.389
He is a NCIS agent.

09:24.433 --> 09:26.217
Oh, NCIS.

09:26.261 --> 09:29.177
He could've joined the real Navy
if it wasn't

09:29.220 --> 09:30.787
for that criminal record.

09:30.831 --> 09:33.747
The only Parker who
never wore the uniform.

09:33.790 --> 09:35.749
- So, you're Navy?
- I was.

09:35.792 --> 09:38.012
Three tours on the
USS <i>Garrett County.</i>

09:38.055 --> 09:40.928
Mm. A whole military family.

09:40.971 --> 09:43.234
No wonder you need
extra disclosure forms.

09:43.278 --> 09:44.758
Oh.

09:44.801 --> 09:47.499
Guess he didn't
tell you. Figures.

09:47.543 --> 09:49.545
Coming here was a mistake.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.808
What are you...
What did I say?

09:51.852 --> 09:53.549
It's what
you're not saying, Dad.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.333
We just need to know
if Viv said anything

09:55.377 --> 09:57.248
about where she was going
or what she was doing.

09:57.292 --> 09:58.249
Well, why didn't you ask?

09:58.293 --> 09:59.816
I've been trying to!

09:59.860 --> 10:01.775
Not hard enough.
Because I would've told you

10:01.818 --> 10:03.559
that Viv said she was going
for her usual run

10:03.603 --> 10:04.821
near Wyatt Lake.

10:07.476 --> 10:09.739
Um, thank you.

10:13.830 --> 10:15.266
See you on Sunday for Risk!

10:18.313 --> 10:20.184
We got tire tracks.
We got a water bottle

10:20.228 --> 10:22.491
and a towel,
but nothing to tell us

10:22.534 --> 10:24.798
- who took your ex-wife.
- Or where they took her.

10:26.408 --> 10:27.801
Any luck
in your neck of the woods?

10:29.324 --> 10:30.455
No sign of our bird-watcher

10:30.499 --> 10:31.805
or where he took
the photos from.

10:31.848 --> 10:33.545
Copy. Keep looking.

10:33.589 --> 10:35.504
Mc
Based on the angle

10:35.547 --> 10:36.244
of the camera,
definitely say

10:36.287 --> 10:37.637
we're getting close.

10:39.073 --> 10:40.857
Your dad was Navy, right?

10:40.901 --> 10:43.991
Oh, loud and proud.
Sometimes very loud.

10:44.034 --> 10:47.995
So, did he get angry
when you didn't join?

10:48.038 --> 10:49.997
You still thinking about
what Parker's dad said?

10:50.040 --> 10:53.609
You know,
he eventually got over it.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.525
Think, uh, joining NCIS
actually helped.

10:56.568 --> 10:59.180
Well, I don't think that's
the case with Papa Parker.

10:59.223 --> 11:02.052
I think his son joining NCIS
actually made things worse.

11:02.096 --> 11:05.447
Hmm. Well,
I can definitely understand

11:05.490 --> 11:06.753
Parker not saying anything.

11:08.276 --> 11:10.060
You know, I think we
- may have something here. Hmm.

11:10.104 --> 11:11.845
Someone made a
shooter's nest.

11:15.587 --> 11:16.719
Mc
Oh, this is definitely

11:16.763 --> 11:17.981
where the photos
were taken from.

11:18.025 --> 11:19.243
Looks like our bird-watcher

11:19.287 --> 11:21.071
had a seed habit.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.509
Found our photo spot.

11:24.553 --> 11:27.687
Got some chewed-up
sunflower seeds, too.

11:27.730 --> 11:29.645
The seeds. Salted
or unsalted?

11:29.689 --> 11:32.387
I did not taste them.

11:32.430 --> 11:35.433
- Why?
- Bag and tag everything. Torres, take the lead here.

11:35.477 --> 11:36.870
Hey, you all right?
No.

11:36.913 --> 11:38.872
I won't be until we find Viv.

11:46.923 --> 11:48.751
<i>I just want to know</i>

11:48.795 --> 11:50.535
how many dates constitutes
a relationship.

11:50.579 --> 11:53.495
One? Two? 20?

11:53.538 --> 11:55.453
Filling out
your disclosure forms?

11:55.497 --> 11:58.848
No. Not me. I am...

11:58.892 --> 12:01.546
- asking for a friend.
- Right.

12:01.590 --> 12:03.374
Well, in that case,
tell your friend

12:03.418 --> 12:05.159
I think it's more
about the quality of dates

12:05.202 --> 12:07.117
than the quantity.

12:07.161 --> 12:08.771
Talking about your coffee
dates with Jimmy?

12:08.815 --> 12:12.601
No, we're talking about--
Wait.

12:12.644 --> 12:14.777
How do you know about
our coffee dates?
Hmm?

12:14.821 --> 12:16.083
Little birdie told me.

12:16.126 --> 12:18.694
A little birdie
of the genus Palmer?

12:18.738 --> 12:19.695
Ooh.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.392
What do you got, Kase?

12:21.436 --> 12:23.394
A DNA match to the
sunflower shells

12:23.438 --> 12:26.746
- you guys found yesterday.
- Well, that was fast.

12:26.789 --> 12:28.138
Because our bird-watcher
was in the system

12:28.182 --> 12:30.967
as a government employee.

12:31.011 --> 12:34.101
Meet former FBI Special Agent
Frank Ressler.

12:34.144 --> 12:35.929
According to his file,

12:35.972 --> 12:38.322
he was fired last year
for taking bribes.

12:38.366 --> 12:40.803
Well, looks like he graduated
from fraud to kidnapping.

12:40.847 --> 12:42.718
Former FBI.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.633
Maybe he has history
with Parker.

12:44.676 --> 12:48.811
Says here
they used to be partners.

12:48.855 --> 12:51.901
Why would his former partner
kidnap his ex-wife?

12:51.945 --> 12:54.774
Yeah, that's a good question.

12:54.817 --> 12:56.993
I'll send the address.

13:03.173 --> 13:05.654
Take the back.
We'll go through the front.

13:05.697 --> 13:06.960
So, how long were you partners
with this guy?

13:07.003 --> 13:09.963
Too long. Let's move.

13:11.181 --> 13:12.139
McGEE:NCIS!

13:13.967 --> 13:15.925
Vintage Mercedes.

13:15.969 --> 13:16.926
Vivian's car.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.931
House is clear.
The trunk.

13:36.990 --> 13:38.992
We've got blood.

13:49.611 --> 13:51.613
That your former partner?

13:53.180 --> 13:56.009
Yep. What's left of him.

14:06.062 --> 14:08.717
High-end camera equipment,
sunflower seeds.

14:08.760 --> 14:11.720
Looks like Frank Ressler is
our bird-watcher.

14:11.763 --> 14:13.722
Which also makes him
one of our kidnappers.

14:13.765 --> 14:15.506
So where's our
missing ex-wife?

14:15.550 --> 14:17.247
Parker's still processing
the house.

14:17.291 --> 14:19.249
There's no sign of Vivian
or the second kidnapper.

14:19.293 --> 14:21.034
- Ski Mask Man.
- Yeah.

14:21.077 --> 14:23.732
Bullet to the back.
I'm thinking Ski Mask

14:23.775 --> 14:25.429
double-crossed
his partner in crime.

14:25.473 --> 14:27.910
Speaking of bad partners,
I heard that our victim here

14:27.954 --> 14:29.651
used to work with Parker
at the FBI.

14:29.694 --> 14:31.435
That's what Parker said.

14:31.479 --> 14:33.611
He hasn't said much else.

14:33.655 --> 14:36.049
Not since he left the park
in a hurry yesterday.

14:36.092 --> 14:38.442
What, you think he knew Ressler
chewed sunflower seeds?

14:38.486 --> 14:40.836
Unsalted sunflower seeds.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.838
Are we thinking that
Parker came here

14:42.882 --> 14:43.926
to confront his ex-partner?

14:43.970 --> 14:46.233
You thought right.

14:46.276 --> 14:48.278
I did come here last night.

14:48.322 --> 14:51.542
So what exactly happened
after you came here last night?

14:51.586 --> 14:53.501
Nothing, because he wasn't home.

14:53.544 --> 14:54.458
And Vivian's car sure as hell
wasn't in the driveway,

14:54.502 --> 14:55.242
so I left.

14:56.765 --> 14:58.027
And what time was that?

14:58.071 --> 15:00.551
I don't know, Jimmy. Why?

15:00.595 --> 15:02.553
Because body temperature
tells me he died

15:02.597 --> 15:04.555
about 10:00 p.m. last night,

15:04.599 --> 15:07.602
which is, obviously,
after you left, right?

15:07.645 --> 15:09.125
Obviously.

15:12.563 --> 15:15.305
All right, yes, I had a hunch
about the sunflower seeds,

15:15.349 --> 15:17.742
but it was a long shot,
so I wanted to check it out

15:17.786 --> 15:20.745
before dragging all of you
into yet another chapter

15:20.789 --> 15:22.269
of my sordid history.

15:22.312 --> 15:25.228
Well, Parker, we're reading
that chapter now.

15:25.272 --> 15:27.013
Yeah, why would
your former partner

15:27.056 --> 15:29.058
want to kidnap your ex-wife?

15:29.102 --> 15:31.887
Let's just say
after he was fired,

15:31.931 --> 15:33.062
we had a falling out.

15:33.106 --> 15:35.282
Over what?

15:35.325 --> 15:37.937
Over me getting him fired.

15:41.244 --> 15:43.768
The FBI was shocked to learn
of Vivian's abduction.

15:43.812 --> 15:45.683
How can we help
NCIS find her?

15:45.727 --> 15:48.034
Appreciate the offer,
Deputy Director Sweeney,

15:48.077 --> 15:50.384
but right now
we're just asking that

15:50.427 --> 15:51.689
all local
and federal agencies

15:51.733 --> 15:53.256
keep an open line
of communication.

15:53.300 --> 15:55.650
And in that spirit, please,
pass along my sympathy

15:55.693 --> 15:56.956
to Agent Parker.

15:56.999 --> 16:00.002
I know he and Vivian were close.

16:00.046 --> 16:02.004
We still are, Chief,
because she's still alive.

16:02.048 --> 16:05.660
Agent Parker, my apologies.
I misspoke.

16:05.703 --> 16:07.618
Yeah, not the first time.

16:07.662 --> 16:11.057
As I recall, you accidentally
fired me for doing my job.

16:11.100 --> 16:12.797
Oh, that was no accident.

16:12.841 --> 16:14.930
Your job was to bring
Agent Gibbs to Justice,

16:14.974 --> 16:16.410
not let him disappear
in Alaska.

16:16.453 --> 16:18.238
Gentlemen, perhaps
we should discuss

16:18.281 --> 16:20.936
the firing of our murder victim.
Agent Ressler?

16:20.980 --> 16:22.633
I'd be happy to, Director.

16:22.677 --> 16:24.592
The FBI takes pride
in ridding itself

16:24.635 --> 16:27.725
of corrupt agents.

16:27.769 --> 16:30.032
The last case Special Agents
Parker and Ressler

16:30.076 --> 16:32.295
worked together was
a fraud investigation.

16:32.339 --> 16:35.559
A U.S. senator was using
his security briefings

16:35.603 --> 16:38.040
as insider information
to buy stocks.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.215
Turns out he was
buying my partner,

16:39.259 --> 16:40.825
so I blew the whistle.

16:40.869 --> 16:43.350
Agent Ressler was caught
destroying evidence

16:43.393 --> 16:46.048
in exchange for hush money,
which was never found.

16:46.092 --> 16:48.746
So he avoided prison,
but after Ressler was fired,

16:48.790 --> 16:51.575
his life quickly fell apart.

16:51.619 --> 16:54.491
Messy divorce.
Oh, bankruptcy.

16:54.535 --> 16:56.841
He blamed it all on me.
He wrote threatening letters,

16:56.885 --> 16:58.408
left constant messages.

16:58.452 --> 17:01.846
He also filed a costly
defamation suit against you.

17:01.890 --> 17:04.153
Now that he's dead,

17:04.197 --> 17:05.241
it all conveniently goes away.

17:07.939 --> 17:09.071
Deputy Director,
are you accusing

17:09.115 --> 17:11.204
one of my agents of murder?

17:11.247 --> 17:14.250
Oh, I misspoke again.
I'm simply saying that,

17:14.294 --> 17:16.426
given Agent Parker's history
with the victim,

17:16.470 --> 17:18.211
he should be on the list
of suspects.

17:18.254 --> 17:20.387
At the top, I'm sure.

17:20.430 --> 17:22.084
If NCIS can't see this,
perhaps the FBI

17:22.128 --> 17:24.782
should take over
this investigation.

17:24.826 --> 17:28.656
I assure you,
NCIS will pursue all leads.

17:28.699 --> 17:30.179
We'll be in touch.

17:33.269 --> 17:35.010
I should have warned you
he has trust issues.

17:35.054 --> 17:38.013
He's also got a point.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.885
Director, if you think
for one second that I killed...

17:40.929 --> 17:43.627
No, Parker, I don't.

17:43.671 --> 17:45.934
But I do think you're
too close to the case.

17:45.977 --> 17:48.980
Ex-wives, ex-partners.
Parker, I have no choice.

17:49.024 --> 17:51.070
I have to send you home.

17:53.550 --> 17:55.813
I know.

17:55.857 --> 17:57.989
But I'm not gonna stop
looking for Vivian.

17:58.033 --> 18:00.209
I know.

18:04.561 --> 18:06.476
I can't believe that Parker
never told us

18:06.520 --> 18:09.305
that his ex-wife is
a paranormal investigator.

18:09.349 --> 18:11.655
And apparently, his whole family
is in the Navy.

18:11.699 --> 18:13.135
I mean, these are
the sort of things

18:13.179 --> 18:14.702
we should know
about a teammate.

18:14.745 --> 18:18.488
We can't all be open books,
Dr. Palmer.

18:18.532 --> 18:22.405
Perhaps keeping secrets is
another of his hobbies,

18:22.449 --> 18:26.888
like bird watching
or pastry buying.

18:26.931 --> 18:29.369
I heard that
he also gardens.

18:29.412 --> 18:31.762
Apparently, he's been
trying to clone

18:31.806 --> 18:34.025
Kasie's pomato plant
for the last month

18:34.069 --> 18:36.419
in his rooftop greenhouse.

18:36.463 --> 18:37.986
That does not sound real.

18:38.029 --> 18:39.901
Exactly. We don't know
enough about him.

18:39.944 --> 18:42.904
Well, I just learned today
that Dr. Mallard moonlights

18:42.947 --> 18:44.645
as a refrigerator repairman.

18:44.688 --> 18:47.430
It's one of my many skills.

18:47.474 --> 18:50.390
Yeah, the compressor
went out on 106.

18:50.433 --> 18:51.434
He's the only one that
knows how to fix it.

18:51.478 --> 18:52.696
Ah.

18:52.740 --> 18:53.828
Despite my leaving

18:53.871 --> 18:55.873
specific instructions.

18:55.917 --> 18:58.093
This time, I was in the middle
of an autopsy.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.486
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

18:59.529 --> 19:01.488
An autopsy I'm about
to get an update on?

19:01.531 --> 19:04.273
Right. Frank Ressler.
He was killed with

19:04.317 --> 19:06.754
a single nine-millimeter slug
that punctured

19:06.797 --> 19:08.059
his lung and
his pulmonary artery.

19:08.103 --> 19:09.713
Kasie has the bullet?

19:09.757 --> 19:11.193
Yeah, along with
the tissue I pulled

19:11.237 --> 19:12.760
from underneath his fingernails.

19:12.803 --> 19:14.196
Here, look at this.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.764
These bruises on his forearm

19:16.807 --> 19:18.113
appear to be defensive wounds.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.810
So he fought with his killer.

19:19.854 --> 19:22.509
Yeah. Hopefully we can
get a hit on that DNA.

19:22.552 --> 19:25.512
Well, that is very good work.

19:27.383 --> 19:30.081
Ah, I see you are, uh, starting
on your HR forms already.

19:30.125 --> 19:32.388
Oh. Uh, yeah,
yeah. Hey, funny

19:32.432 --> 19:34.825
you should mention
that. Um... Uh...

19:34.869 --> 19:39.178
Why is Jessica Knight listed
as a workplace relationship?

19:41.180 --> 19:42.572
I was gonna talk
to you about that

19:42.616 --> 19:44.270
before I submitted
those forms.

19:44.313 --> 19:45.314
When?

19:47.751 --> 19:50.232
How about now?

19:53.583 --> 19:55.324
Director Vance.

19:55.368 --> 19:58.197
Yes, yes, I heard that. Um...

19:58.240 --> 20:00.286
To be continued.

20:02.592 --> 20:04.986
Well, that's one
of your problems fixed.

20:06.161 --> 20:07.336
Anything else?

20:10.470 --> 20:12.994
I'm telling you,
Vivian's car is a dead end.

20:13.037 --> 20:15.039
No DNA, no fingerprints.

20:15.083 --> 20:16.954
Certainly not a GPS tracker.

20:16.998 --> 20:18.217
Not even an after-market one?

20:18.260 --> 20:21.220
Vivian still uses
a cassette player.

20:21.263 --> 20:23.918
Oh, we got Aretha and Bowie
and Frank.

20:23.961 --> 20:26.268
Zappa, not Sinatra.

20:26.312 --> 20:27.269
Kase, you gotta
give me something.

20:27.313 --> 20:29.010
It's about 24 hours

20:29.053 --> 20:30.229
since Vivian was taken,
and we got nothing.

20:30.272 --> 20:32.361
Oh, not true.
We have these.

20:34.885 --> 20:36.670
Wood shavings?

20:36.713 --> 20:38.759
I found them in
the driver's-side footwell.

20:38.802 --> 20:40.804
Okay, maybe Parker's not
the only one with hobbies.

20:40.848 --> 20:43.285
Maybe Vivian could be
into woodworking.

20:43.329 --> 20:45.592
Oh, no, I doubt
these came from Vivian.

20:45.635 --> 20:49.378
The rest of the car is
meticulously detailed.

20:49.422 --> 20:51.119
Not so much as a crumb
between the seats.

20:51.162 --> 20:53.077
Okay, so they were left
by a kidnapper.

20:53.121 --> 20:54.905
Can you trace the wood?

20:54.949 --> 20:57.560
Mass spec is still analyzing,

20:57.604 --> 20:59.562
but it looks
pretty common to me.

20:59.606 --> 21:01.999
No tracing, no help. Ooh.

21:02.043 --> 21:02.870
Could that be some help?

21:02.913 --> 21:05.438
Uh, maybe.

21:05.481 --> 21:08.702
It's a DNA match to the tissue
Jimmy found on the body.

21:08.745 --> 21:10.181
That seems kind
of fast, again.

21:10.225 --> 21:13.010
Uh, because again, the match is

21:13.054 --> 21:14.708
to a government employee.

21:14.751 --> 21:16.623
Oh. More dirty FBI agents?

21:16.666 --> 21:19.495
Uh, not FBI.

21:23.064 --> 21:25.458
Parker?
It's gotta be a mistake.

21:25.501 --> 21:27.634
Uh, yeah. I'll-I'll
double-check the report.

21:32.378 --> 21:34.249
It's not a mistake.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.860
The DNA found under
the murder victim's fingernails

21:36.904 --> 21:39.863
belongs to... Agent Parker.

21:39.907 --> 21:42.344
So what now?

21:42.388 --> 21:44.955
Now we call Vance,

21:44.999 --> 21:46.870
and bring in Parker
for questioning.

21:57.185 --> 21:59.274
Oh, it's a nice neighborhood.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.884
Given Parker's hobby habit,
I would have thought

22:00.928 --> 22:02.277
he'd live in a place
with a garage.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.148
Or a basement.

22:04.192 --> 22:05.454
According to this,
his apartment's

22:05.498 --> 22:07.891
- on the top floor.
- So just to be clear,

22:07.935 --> 22:09.676
we don't think he actually
did this, right?

22:09.719 --> 22:13.070
Kill someone in cold blood?
Absolutely not.

22:13.114 --> 22:16.987
Well, he did admit to
- going to the house last night.
- That's true.

22:17.031 --> 22:19.903
And, uh, his DNA was underneath
the victim's fingernails.

22:19.947 --> 22:22.906
Also true.

22:22.950 --> 22:26.214
So maybe the ex-partner was
home, and they fought.

22:26.257 --> 22:27.476
Could have been self-defense.

22:27.520 --> 22:30.740
But Parker wouldn't lie
to us about that.

22:30.784 --> 22:31.524
Right?

22:33.917 --> 22:36.224
I hope not.

22:46.190 --> 22:48.671
Oh.

22:48.715 --> 22:50.891
Hey, the gang's all here.

22:50.934 --> 22:52.893
We need to talk.

22:52.936 --> 22:55.678
I was just thinking
the same thing.

22:55.722 --> 22:58.725
Park...

22:58.768 --> 22:59.900
who is it?

22:59.943 --> 23:02.337
Is that...

23:04.034 --> 23:07.734
Everybody, this is
my ex-wife Vivian.

23:18.222 --> 23:19.180
We can talk in here.

23:21.095 --> 23:22.531
So you do have a greenhouse.

23:22.575 --> 23:24.577
My little oasis.

23:24.620 --> 23:26.274
I'd ask you to sit
and relax, but, uh...

23:26.317 --> 23:28.537
When did you find Vivian?

23:28.581 --> 23:30.452
And when were you
gonna tell us?

23:30.496 --> 23:34.456
I can help explain that
after I make myself a drink.

23:34.500 --> 23:37.633
- Ginkgo and mint, please.
- Over here.

23:37.677 --> 23:39.809
Given that I was drugged
and held prisoner

23:39.853 --> 23:43.987
for the last day, I need
something to clear my head.

23:44.031 --> 23:45.772
So if you were held prisoner,
how'd you end up here?

23:45.815 --> 23:48.557
I was able to escape
this morning.

23:48.601 --> 23:49.210
Whatever it was they
injected me with

23:49.253 --> 23:50.603
started to wear off.

23:50.646 --> 23:52.256
Must have been
some kind of benzos.

23:52.300 --> 23:53.997
Should you be drinking?

23:54.041 --> 23:57.479
Alcohol? No.

23:57.523 --> 24:00.090
A mix of hot water
and GABA inhibitors?

24:00.134 --> 24:01.527
Yes. Absolutely. Okay...

24:01.570 --> 24:03.006
How did you get away?

24:03.050 --> 24:04.486
Well, in my
drug-induced haze,

24:04.530 --> 24:06.183
all I can remember
are blurry flashes.

24:06.227 --> 24:09.491
I'm sawing of my bindings
on a broken sink.

24:09.535 --> 24:12.015
Kicking out a vent,
and then, uh,

24:12.059 --> 24:13.843
making a run for it
through a patch of trees

24:13.887 --> 24:16.324
until I was finally able
to make it to a road.

24:16.367 --> 24:18.413
She flagged down
a passing driver,

24:18.457 --> 24:20.023
and then used their phone
to call me.

24:20.067 --> 24:23.462
Yeah, Parker's the only person
I knew I could trust.

24:23.505 --> 24:24.811
We've been through
a lot together.

24:24.854 --> 24:26.943
For better or worse.

24:26.987 --> 24:29.642
Parker, why didn't you call us
about any of this?

24:29.685 --> 24:32.340
Things happened fast.

24:32.383 --> 24:33.863
We just got here
when you showed up.

24:33.907 --> 24:34.864
Why, is there some kind
of problem?

24:36.039 --> 24:38.738
Yeah, there is.

24:38.781 --> 24:41.131
We need you to come with us
back to NCIS.

24:41.175 --> 24:43.220
Vance took me off the case.

24:43.264 --> 24:46.310
Not coming in as an agent.

24:46.354 --> 24:48.051
Coming in as a murder suspect.

24:49.749 --> 24:51.098
Park?

24:58.105 --> 24:59.933
This is a joke, right?

24:59.976 --> 25:01.891
Wish it was.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.330
We couldn't do this
in the conference room?

25:06.374 --> 25:07.854
This chair is uncomfortable.

25:07.897 --> 25:10.160
Same chair as over here.

25:10.204 --> 25:12.380
No, it isn't.

25:12.423 --> 25:15.165
Your DNA was found
under the victim's fingernails.

25:17.341 --> 25:19.126
Would you care to explain that?

25:24.392 --> 25:26.394
Wish I could.

25:26.437 --> 25:28.875
What happened when you went
to Frank Ressler's house?

25:28.918 --> 25:31.704
I knocked on the door.
He wasn't home. I left.

25:31.747 --> 25:34.141
My story isn't changing, fellas.
It's the truth.

25:34.184 --> 25:35.969
And the DNA?

25:36.012 --> 25:39.320
We all know how easy it is
to get this.

25:39.363 --> 25:41.148
All somebody had to do
is go through my trash.

25:41.191 --> 25:42.584
I'm being framed.

25:42.628 --> 25:45.500
That explains why
the kidnapping photos

25:45.544 --> 25:47.676
were sent to NCIS
in the first place.

25:47.720 --> 25:50.549
To taunt me and to create
a motive for murder.

25:50.592 --> 25:52.420
Well, I'd say it worked, then.

25:52.463 --> 25:53.813
Well, that part maybe,

25:53.856 --> 25:56.337
but not cleaning
the victim's fingernails?

25:56.380 --> 25:57.730
Do you really think
I'm that stupid?

26:01.734 --> 26:03.692
No, we don't.

26:03.736 --> 26:05.694
McGEE:But a jury might.
That's why we need to

26:05.738 --> 26:07.522
find the evidence
to prove you're innocent.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.872
Parker, you have any idea
who might be doing this?

26:09.916 --> 26:13.572
No, but I have an idea why
they might be doing this.

26:15.922 --> 26:17.663
May I?Yeah.

26:19.490 --> 26:21.536
Everybody involved
in this case

26:21.580 --> 26:23.756
has one thing in common, right?

26:23.799 --> 26:25.714
All are former FBI.

26:25.758 --> 26:28.587
They took Viv, killed Frank
and framed me.

26:28.630 --> 26:31.894
It's gotta be connected
to our time in the Bureau.

26:31.938 --> 26:33.940
Okay, how do we find out?

26:33.983 --> 26:36.682
We pull my old case files
and we look for a connection.

26:36.725 --> 26:38.945
And how do you plan
to get those files?

26:38.988 --> 26:41.687
If I ask the FBI for help,
they'll want to know why.

26:41.730 --> 26:43.906
Right. And then you'd
have to say that

26:43.950 --> 26:46.430
I'm officially a murder suspect,

26:46.474 --> 26:48.737
and NCIS would have
to turn over this case.

26:48.781 --> 26:50.739
As it is, I should have
called Justice

26:50.783 --> 26:53.176
the minute your DNA
showed up on the victim.

26:53.220 --> 26:56.484
And why didn't you, Director?

26:56.527 --> 26:58.791
Seems I've lost
their number for now.

27:00.880 --> 27:03.709
And how much time might we have
until you find it?

27:06.146 --> 27:07.626
Forty-eight hours.

27:07.669 --> 27:09.410
So I suggest
you find another way

27:09.453 --> 27:10.846
to access those files.

27:10.890 --> 27:12.326
Quickly and quietly.

27:12.369 --> 27:14.763
You know what?

27:14.807 --> 27:17.592
We might have someone who can
access that FBI database.

27:20.421 --> 27:23.685
After you escaped,
you called Parker from here.

27:23.729 --> 27:27.428
The question is
where did you escape from?

27:27.471 --> 27:29.822
Vivian.

27:29.865 --> 27:33.303
I'm sorry, my brain is still
a little scrambled.

27:33.347 --> 27:36.959
My ex-husband is being
interrogated for murder.

27:37.003 --> 27:40.223
I-I should be in there.
I am a federal agent.

27:40.267 --> 27:43.052
Yeah, well, you investigate
UFOs, not murders.

27:43.096 --> 27:47.056
I investigate the unexplained,
and this counts.

27:47.100 --> 27:48.884
Look, I just want to help Park.

27:48.928 --> 27:51.495
You know, for a divorced couple,
you're still pretty close.

27:51.539 --> 27:52.888
Yeah.

27:52.932 --> 27:54.542
Why did you break up?

27:54.585 --> 27:56.892
He left his dirty socks
on the floor.

27:58.764 --> 27:59.765
Listen, there are some things
that even a happy marriage

27:59.808 --> 28:01.505
can't survive,

28:01.549 --> 28:03.507
and I would really rather
not get into it.

28:03.551 --> 28:05.466
Right now, Vivian,
the best way

28:05.509 --> 28:07.337
for you to help Parker
is by helping us.

28:07.381 --> 28:10.253
Starting with finding out
where you were being held.

28:10.297 --> 28:13.213
Close your eyes and try
to picture where you were.

28:13.256 --> 28:15.345
I know how this works.

28:15.389 --> 28:19.001
Anything can help.
Colors, shapes, feelings.

28:19.045 --> 28:22.265
I, um...

28:22.309 --> 28:27.270
I remember feeling trapped,
like-like an animal.

28:27.314 --> 28:29.359
Maybe because it smelled like
a dirty animal cage.

28:29.403 --> 28:31.666
What kind of cage?
Dog cage?

28:31.710 --> 28:36.889
Um, no. Like a, a hamster,
because--

28:36.932 --> 28:38.368
The kind that have, like,

28:38.412 --> 28:39.674
those little wood shavings.

28:39.718 --> 28:42.285
We found wood shavings
in your car.

28:42.329 --> 28:43.809
We're not looking
for a wood shop.

28:45.636 --> 28:46.812
We're looking for
a pet shop.

28:49.075 --> 28:51.033
- Anything?
- Yeah.

28:51.077 --> 28:53.035
There's an abandoned
strip mall that used to have

28:53.079 --> 28:54.689
an old pet store.

28:54.733 --> 28:56.082
That could be where
they were holding me.

28:56.125 --> 28:57.257
Only one way to find out.

28:57.300 --> 28:58.954
Thank you.

29:03.219 --> 29:06.527
Wow.

29:06.570 --> 29:09.878
This reminds me of the botanic
gardens in Glasgow.

29:09.922 --> 29:12.620
Well, the director asked us
to keep a low profile, so... Yeah.

29:12.663 --> 29:14.796
Yeah, a very wise decision.

29:14.840 --> 29:18.669
Especially given this.

29:18.713 --> 29:21.890
Every FBI file that mentions

29:21.934 --> 29:24.327
Special Agent Alden Parker.

29:24.371 --> 29:26.547
Mm. Nice work, Duck.

29:26.590 --> 29:30.856
As NCIS historian,
I couldn't access data

29:30.899 --> 29:32.640
from outside agencies,

29:32.683 --> 29:36.557
but my counterpart at the FBI
was most helpful.

29:36.600 --> 29:38.820
All it took was a glass
of Montrachet

29:38.864 --> 29:40.561
and a little persuasion.

29:40.604 --> 29:41.518
He owed you one?

29:41.562 --> 29:43.346
She did.

29:43.390 --> 29:46.001
Dating within one's
professional circles

29:46.045 --> 29:47.568
has its perks.

29:47.611 --> 29:48.961
Duck, you got a girlfriend?

29:49.004 --> 29:52.312
At my age, who needs labels?

29:52.355 --> 29:54.880
HR, apparently.

29:54.923 --> 29:56.795
I'll get started
on these files.

29:56.838 --> 29:58.187
Federal agents!

30:11.374 --> 30:13.115
- Clear.
- Clear.

30:15.639 --> 30:18.555
Well, this is definitely
where Vivian escaped from.

30:18.599 --> 30:23.125
Unfortunately, no sign of
our kidnapper/killer.

30:23.169 --> 30:24.953
Yes, there is.

30:29.915 --> 30:31.655
You gotta be kidding me.

30:32.918 --> 30:33.962
<i>Whoever wrote this garbage</i>

30:34.006 --> 30:36.182
signed it appropriately.

30:36.225 --> 30:38.445
Mc
"Quoth the raven."Get Kasie on the phone.

30:38.488 --> 30:40.447
Hmm.
<i>The flask, Jimmy.</i> <i>Don't open it.</i>

30:40.490 --> 30:41.535
Code 2 alert.

30:41.578 --> 30:43.885
Biotoxin detected.

30:43.929 --> 30:45.713
<i>This came in the mail today.</i>

30:45.756 --> 30:48.629
It was addressed to Special
Agent Alden Parker and his team.

30:48.672 --> 30:50.457
- What's it say?
- One word.

30:54.678 --> 30:56.419
The Raven.

30:56.463 --> 30:58.813
He's back.

31:05.689 --> 31:08.257
"Nevermore," quoth the raven.

31:08.301 --> 31:10.390
Same calling card.
Same block letters.

31:10.433 --> 31:12.087
Thankfully, no sign of
the same deadly toxin

31:12.131 --> 31:13.523
he tried releasing
a few months ago.

31:13.567 --> 31:16.526
Eh. But our bird is back
with a vengeance.

31:16.570 --> 31:19.312
We're not dealing with
a sane individual.

31:19.355 --> 31:22.706
He went to great lengths
to poison half the city.

31:22.750 --> 31:24.708
And now it appears
he blames you

31:24.752 --> 31:26.101
for stopping the attack.

31:26.145 --> 31:27.842
He blames me for something.

31:27.886 --> 31:30.018
Kidnapping my ex-wife,
killing my ex-partner

31:30.062 --> 31:31.715
and framing me for
the murder.

31:31.759 --> 31:34.980
If he hates you so much,
why not just, you know,

31:35.023 --> 31:37.896
kill you and be done with it?

31:37.939 --> 31:41.290
I'll let the, uh, forensic
psychologist answer that one.

31:41.334 --> 31:43.814
Well, I'd need to perform
a detailed study

31:43.858 --> 31:45.294
to get a proper assessment,

31:45.338 --> 31:49.298
but it appears this Raven
takes pleasure

31:49.342 --> 31:51.474
in prolonging things.

31:51.518 --> 31:53.737
Why bite the lollipop

31:53.781 --> 31:56.566
when you can savor it
over time?

31:56.610 --> 32:00.353
Well, if I'm the sucker,
consider me licked. I'm done.

32:00.396 --> 32:02.442
You're not gonna like this.

32:02.485 --> 32:04.226
Skimming through old
FBI files,

32:04.270 --> 32:06.489
I found an investigation
that's still active.

32:06.533 --> 32:08.361
Why? Who's being investigated?

32:08.404 --> 32:10.232
You are.

32:10.276 --> 32:13.453
How? They don't know about
my DNA.

32:13.496 --> 32:15.759
Not a murder investigation.
It's fraud.

32:15.803 --> 32:18.153
Looks like the FBI found
the hush money that your

32:18.197 --> 32:19.241
former partner took off with.

32:21.591 --> 32:24.290
Money is in an offshore
account in the Caymans

32:24.333 --> 32:25.987
that they think
belongs to you.

32:26.031 --> 32:28.250
Believe me, If I had
an account in the Caymans,

32:28.294 --> 32:30.296
I'd be using it
in the Caymans.

32:30.339 --> 32:31.253
I don't know anything
about this.

32:31.297 --> 32:33.125
This doesn't make sense.

32:33.168 --> 32:34.561
You're already being
framed for murder.

32:34.604 --> 32:36.606
Why add on a lesser
charge of fraud?

32:36.650 --> 32:38.695
I think that was
the doctor's point.

32:38.739 --> 32:41.960
Indeed. Clearly, the Raven
hasn't finished savoring.

32:42.003 --> 32:44.397
Unless we're missing something.

32:44.440 --> 32:46.790
Why are we still talking
about him? We got work to do.

32:46.834 --> 32:50.055
In 36 hours, Vance hands
the case over to DOJ.

32:50.098 --> 32:51.578
- Let's do it.
- Stop!

32:54.146 --> 32:56.713
Okay, we're handing over
this case right now.

32:56.757 --> 32:59.760
What? Why?
Director said that...

32:59.803 --> 33:01.066
And I'm saying that
this has gone far enough.

33:01.109 --> 33:02.676
We all know what
the Raven is capable of,

33:02.719 --> 33:03.677
and you heard the doc.

33:03.720 --> 33:05.766
This guy is not done.

33:05.809 --> 33:07.855
Yeah. That's exactly why
we need to stop him.

33:07.898 --> 33:10.597
Right. He got away the first
time and look what happened.

33:10.640 --> 33:12.860
Yeah, what happened was
Jimmy and Kasie nearly died,

33:12.903 --> 33:15.776
and I'm not gonna let that
happen again to any of you.

33:15.819 --> 33:17.386
Parker, we can do our job.

33:17.430 --> 33:18.997
Doing your job doesn't include

33:19.040 --> 33:22.739
taking unnecessary risks
for me.

33:22.783 --> 33:25.090
I'm not Gibbs. Okay?

33:27.831 --> 33:29.746
You don't owe me anything.

33:31.835 --> 33:34.621
I appreciate all of you

33:34.664 --> 33:35.970
more than you know.

33:38.581 --> 33:40.061
But it's over.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.379
Hey, what are you doing with
Polly the pomato plant?

33:53.422 --> 33:55.076
Parker said to give her back.

33:55.120 --> 33:57.339
So it's true?

33:57.383 --> 33:59.080
He's really turning himself in?

33:59.124 --> 34:01.300
It looks that way.
Meeting with Vance this morning.

34:01.343 --> 34:02.823
Man.

34:04.520 --> 34:07.045
- Hey, did we miss the meeting?
- What meeting?

34:07.088 --> 34:09.134
The meeting to help Parker.

34:09.177 --> 34:10.570
I mean, if the Raven is back,

34:10.613 --> 34:12.093
he's gonna need our help,
believe me.

34:12.137 --> 34:13.616
I've been thinking about
what Parker said,

34:13.660 --> 34:15.575
and I think maybe he's right.

34:15.618 --> 34:16.880
Maybe we've done
everything that we can do,

34:16.924 --> 34:18.578
and we just need
to walk away.

34:18.621 --> 34:20.232
Right.

34:20.275 --> 34:21.363
I mean, it's not like
it's Gibbs, you know.

34:21.407 --> 34:23.061
We don't know him
all that well.

34:23.104 --> 34:24.279
Right.

34:26.107 --> 34:27.935
So why does this feel wrong?

34:27.978 --> 34:31.025
He had our backs when
the Raven came back last time.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.853
Jimmy and I know that
up close and personal.

34:32.896 --> 34:34.681
He had your backs, too.

34:34.724 --> 34:37.162
He risked his life
to save ours

34:37.205 --> 34:38.119
when we were held hostage
on that ship.

34:40.513 --> 34:43.820
And Parker risked everything
for Gibbs, too, up in Alaska.

34:43.864 --> 34:48.129
You know everything
you need to know about the man.

34:48.173 --> 34:50.349
It's him that doesn't know us.

34:50.392 --> 34:51.698
Yeah, thinking that
we'd turn our backs on him

34:51.741 --> 34:53.613
at a time like this.

34:53.656 --> 34:56.137
Well, then,
I say we get back to work.

34:56.181 --> 34:59.097
- Yeah.
- All right, let's go update those BOLOs on the Raven.

34:59.140 --> 35:02.143
I'll keep processing
- everything we have.
- Hey, Jess, Jess.

35:02.187 --> 35:04.319
- Uh, you have one second? Yeah.
- Yeah.

35:06.930 --> 35:09.498
- What's up?
- Uh, hey, I just...

35:09.542 --> 35:13.154
I wanted to apologize for
listing you on my HR forms.

35:13.198 --> 35:14.895
You're thinking
about your HR forms?

35:14.938 --> 35:16.418
Now?

35:16.462 --> 35:17.854
I-I feel like I overstepped.

35:17.898 --> 35:19.204
You know, it was...

35:20.901 --> 35:23.338
It was just
a couple coffee dates, right?

35:25.558 --> 35:27.299
I don't know.

35:28.952 --> 35:31.346
You see, 'cause-'cause
I don't know, either.

35:32.652 --> 35:34.349
I mean, with all the bad
that's happened this year,

35:34.393 --> 35:35.524
why deny the good?

35:37.396 --> 35:40.355
And we have something good.

35:40.399 --> 35:42.009
Don't we?

35:43.315 --> 35:45.317
Yeah.

35:45.360 --> 35:48.363
But are you saying that
that something good

35:48.407 --> 35:50.191
should be disclosed?

35:51.975 --> 35:54.282
Do you think we should find out?

36:07.165 --> 36:09.906
That is definitely
worth disclosing.

36:09.950 --> 36:11.778
I think that we
should do that again.

36:11.821 --> 36:13.693
You know,
- just-just to make sure.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.393
Ooh!

36:20.221 --> 36:21.701
KNIGHT:Uh...

36:21.744 --> 36:23.529
You guys!

36:23.572 --> 36:26.401
I...What happened
to Polly the pomato plant?

36:26.445 --> 36:28.882
It was an accident.
What had happened was...

36:28.925 --> 36:30.536
I-I sneezed.

36:30.579 --> 36:32.233
Wait, hold up.

36:32.277 --> 36:33.365
We've got a problem.

36:35.280 --> 36:37.369
There is more in here
than just potatoes and tomatoes.

36:40.023 --> 36:41.024
Is that what I think it is?

36:43.984 --> 36:45.594
Parker's place is bugged.

36:45.638 --> 36:47.857
We found this hidden
inside the pomato plant.

36:47.901 --> 36:50.208
Safe bet is they're
all over your apartment.

36:50.251 --> 36:51.557
Who's bugging me?

36:51.600 --> 36:52.819
The FBI.

36:52.862 --> 36:54.429
We did a backdoor search

36:54.473 --> 36:55.996
into DOJ records.

36:56.039 --> 36:58.085
Found the warrant.

36:58.128 --> 37:00.261
So the listening
devices are legal.

37:00.305 --> 37:02.350
Well,
the justification's pretty thin.

37:02.394 --> 37:03.830
Obviously, they
pulled some strings

37:03.873 --> 37:05.223
to get a judge to sign off.

37:05.266 --> 37:07.268
The FBI wants Parker's head.

37:07.312 --> 37:09.575
And the Raven is handing it
to them on a silver platter.

37:09.618 --> 37:13.274
Are you saying that the Raven
is connected to the FBI?

37:13.318 --> 37:15.450
What we're saying is
that if we turn Parker over now,

37:15.494 --> 37:17.104
we're not gonna find out
what's really going on.

37:19.149 --> 37:21.674
All right,
I agree. This is bad.

37:21.717 --> 37:23.850
But I'm afraid
it's too little, too late.

37:23.893 --> 37:25.765
We just need more time,
- Director.
And I can't

37:25.808 --> 37:27.245
give it to you,
Agent McGee.

37:27.288 --> 37:28.594
I called Justice
this morning.

37:28.637 --> 37:30.073
Call them back.

37:30.117 --> 37:31.031
They've already sent the FBI

37:31.074 --> 37:32.293
to take over this case.

37:32.337 --> 37:34.252
Deputy Director Sweeney

37:34.295 --> 37:35.383
- just signed in downstairs.
- Look,

37:35.427 --> 37:37.298
I told you this was happening.

37:37.342 --> 37:38.908
Why are you
still trying to help me?

37:38.952 --> 37:40.606
Because you forgot
rules five, eight and 15.

37:42.129 --> 37:43.391
We'll send you a list.

37:43.435 --> 37:45.001
We got to do something
before the FBI

37:45.045 --> 37:46.394
walks through that door.

37:56.926 --> 37:58.667
You two, stay here.

37:58.711 --> 38:00.713
- You see Parker, cuff him.
- Yes, sir.

38:04.064 --> 38:06.022
Deputy Director Sweeney, FBI.

38:06.066 --> 38:07.328
I'm here to see the director.

38:07.372 --> 38:09.287
Is he expecting you?

38:10.897 --> 38:12.377
Deputy Director. Come on in.

38:18.513 --> 38:21.255
Can I get you something?
Coffee, water?

38:21.299 --> 38:22.952
The Department of Justice
said you agreed

38:22.996 --> 38:24.389
to hand over this case.

38:24.432 --> 38:26.086
Along with Agent Parker.

38:26.129 --> 38:27.870
And we plan to cooperate fully.

38:27.914 --> 38:30.525
Well? I'm waiting.

38:30.569 --> 38:33.093
The file boxes are
already packed downstairs.

38:33.136 --> 38:35.269
But as for Agent Parker,

38:35.313 --> 38:38.098
your guess is as good as mine.

38:38.141 --> 38:40.361
An extra go bag
with a change of clothes

38:40.405 --> 38:41.928
in case the FBI
has your apartment staked out.

38:41.971 --> 38:43.451
And a burner phone.

38:43.495 --> 38:45.105
Untraceable.

38:45.148 --> 38:46.933
Look, I appreciate
what you all are doing,

38:46.976 --> 38:48.717
but, uh, I've never been a fan

38:48.761 --> 38:50.676
of running away
from my problems.

38:50.719 --> 38:52.155
You're not running.
You're just doing your job.

38:52.199 --> 38:53.679
We all are.

38:53.722 --> 38:56.203
Starting with that account
in the Caymans.

38:56.246 --> 38:58.248
What, the account
the FBI thinks belongs to me?

38:58.292 --> 38:59.380
Only because
they stopped digging.

38:59.424 --> 39:01.164
I kept looking.

39:01.208 --> 39:02.644
Were you able to trace
the money?

39:02.688 --> 39:04.733
Uh, it bounced around
through various accounting firms

39:04.777 --> 39:05.647
on the eastern seaboard.

39:05.691 --> 39:06.518
Got a list?

39:08.433 --> 39:10.348
Sorry I couldn't
narrow it down more.

39:10.391 --> 39:12.175
Leave that to me.

39:14.177 --> 39:15.570
I'll keep digging

39:15.614 --> 39:16.571
on my end, too.

39:23.839 --> 39:25.580
Morning, Chief.

39:25.624 --> 39:27.365
Where the hell are you?

39:27.408 --> 39:28.235
Well,
I had a little car trouble,

39:28.278 --> 39:29.584
but, uh, don't worry.

39:29.628 --> 39:31.412
I'm just about to jump
into an Uber.

39:31.456 --> 39:33.588
I hope
you're on your way to NCIS.

39:33.632 --> 39:35.416
Well, I got to be honest.

39:35.460 --> 39:37.375
Wasn't the plan.

39:37.418 --> 39:39.289
Running will only
make things worse, Parker.

39:39.333 --> 39:40.856
For you and NCIS.

39:40.900 --> 39:42.467
Not running.

39:42.510 --> 39:43.685
Just doing my job.

39:45.339 --> 39:46.471
We'll be in touch.

39:49.169 --> 39:51.389
This isn't over.

39:57.569 --> 39:59.527
Well, last chance.

39:59.571 --> 40:01.442
Sure you want to help
a fugitive?

40:01.486 --> 40:02.922
Not a fugitive.

40:02.965 --> 40:04.532
Family.

40:08.536 --> 40:09.711
Thank you.

40:15.151 --> 40:16.979
So...

40:17.023 --> 40:18.416
Same goes for you.

40:18.459 --> 40:20.374
You sure you want to do this?

40:20.418 --> 40:22.550
This Raven
came after me, too.

40:22.594 --> 40:24.770
Whatever bigger plans he has,
I'm already a part of it.

40:26.293 --> 40:27.990
For better or for worse.

40:39.219 --> 40:41.003
We could lose our
jobs for this.

40:41.047 --> 40:43.745
Hmm. Or worse.

40:43.789 --> 40:45.486
Just like old times.

40:52.058 --> 40:53.363
Do you have any idea
where we're gonna stay

40:53.407 --> 40:55.017
on this little sojourn
of ours?

40:55.061 --> 40:57.542
I'm guessing that they're
watching my place, too.

40:57.585 --> 40:58.673
You remember our honeymoon?

41:00.240 --> 41:02.416
How could I forget?

41:03.896 --> 41:07.334
I was thinking that might be
a good place to lay low.

41:07.377 --> 41:08.814
Do you know
that I still have

41:08.857 --> 41:11.425
that mixtape that you made
for us when we eloped?

41:11.469 --> 41:12.687
Get out of here.
I'm not kidding.

41:12.731 --> 41:14.515
I just saw it
- the other day.
- Wow.

41:14.559 --> 41:17.344
Man, I worked
- hard on that one.
- I remember.

41:18.954 --> 41:20.390
I got it right back here.

41:22.741 --> 41:24.569
Just saw it the other day.

41:25.831 --> 41:26.788
Let's see.

41:28.442 --> 41:30.575
Which one is it?

41:30.618 --> 41:33.186
No, it's not that one.

41:33.229 --> 41:35.188
Ah!

41:35.231 --> 41:37.320
There it is.

41:37.364 --> 41:38.931
Got it?

41:38.974 --> 41:40.323
Original sticker
- and everything.
- Oh, my...

41:40.367 --> 41:41.803
All right.

Go ahead.

41:49.376 --> 41:50.812
