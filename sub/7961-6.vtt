WEBVTT

00:03.190 --> 00:04.189
Those are texts and e-mails
your son and eric exchanged

00:04.219 --> 00:05.588
Before the party.

00:05.618 --> 00:07.677
It was like
you were flirting?
I told you that.

00:07.717 --> 00:10.545
How is any of this rape?
I never said "yes!"

00:10.584 --> 00:12.214
Mateo doesn't
deserve suspension.

00:12.254 --> 00:14.682
Evy was being harassed.
He was protecting her.

00:14.722 --> 00:17.120
All mateo was doing
was acting like a thug!

00:17.160 --> 00:19.289
I don't want
to go to leyland anymore.

00:19.329 --> 00:21.157
I want to go
back to marshall.

00:22.226 --> 00:23.996
The police called.

00:24.056 --> 00:25.684
They're not
gonna arrest anybody.

00:25.724 --> 00:26.983
There are not
gonna be any charges.

00:27.023 --> 00:28.982
I need to know from you
that this is over,

00:29.032 --> 00:30.631
That you're done putting us
through this.

00:30.661 --> 00:31.900
Are you gay?

00:31.930 --> 00:34.128
Mom said that's why you tried
to kill yourself.

00:34.158 --> 00:37.985
Eric tanner's return has to be
a display of tolerance.

00:38.025 --> 00:40.354
We don't have to change
what people believe.

00:40.394 --> 00:43.162
What we have to change is
how they perceive the issue.

00:45.000 --> 00:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:48.786 --> 01:51.723
He's your friend.

01:51.753 --> 01:55.051
He's your fellow student.
He's your teammate.

01:55.091 --> 01:58.518
And we have to be ready
to welcome eric back.

01:58.558 --> 01:59.827
We have to be leaders.

01:59.857 --> 02:02.286
We have to show other people
how it's done.

02:04.354 --> 02:06.613
Now, eric's no different now

02:06.653 --> 02:09.919
Than how he was
before he became --

02:09.960 --> 02:15.656
Before we f-found out his --
uh, about his orientation.

02:19.164 --> 02:20.762
Now, we have to finish out
the season.

02:20.792 --> 02:22.892
We have to finish it
out strong.

02:22.932 --> 02:25.559
We -- we still have a chance
to do good things,

02:25.599 --> 02:26.998
On and off the court.

02:28.528 --> 02:34.453
And that begins with how
we welcome back one of our own.

02:34.493 --> 02:36.921
For real, coach, he's
gonna be taking showers with us?

02:40.099 --> 02:41.798
That's messed up, man.

02:45.965 --> 02:48.923
-Captions by vitac

02:48.973 --> 02:50.941
What you're doing
is godless.

02:50.971 --> 02:52.770
It's against everything
leyland stands for.

02:52.800 --> 02:53.899
We had an agreement.

02:53.939 --> 02:55.907
This school has always
been about values.

02:55.937 --> 02:57.977
You may not agree with them,
but you don't get to promote
some alternative agenda.

02:58.007 --> 03:00.105
We sat at this table,
and we agreed...

03:00.135 --> 03:02.533
No, you all
on the executive committee --
...That we would welcome eric
back to this school,

03:02.573 --> 03:03.872
And we would do it
in a way

03:03.902 --> 03:07.030
That demonstrated the best
qualities of the school.

03:07.070 --> 03:09.369
I got bashir's e-mail.
He's e-mailing.

03:09.408 --> 03:11.547
Do you all not even understand
the need for discretion?

03:11.577 --> 03:14.215
We've got kids at this school --
children --

03:14.275 --> 03:15.874
And it's like you're
trying to indoctrinate them.

03:15.914 --> 03:18.711
It is more critical that --
you're normalizing
deviant behavior.

03:18.741 --> 03:20.541
You don't get it.
You don't get it.

03:20.581 --> 03:22.379
The mother of the boy
who says he was assaulted

03:22.409 --> 03:23.708
Has filed suit against us.

03:23.748 --> 03:26.386
For what?
Negligence. Failure to protect.

03:26.416 --> 03:28.884
Somebody's trying to involve us
in something every other week.

03:28.914 --> 03:30.383
That's why
we have lawyers.

03:30.413 --> 03:31.713
That's how
you want to handle it?

03:31.753 --> 03:33.381
Just throw it on the pile
and hope it self-corrects?

03:33.411 --> 03:35.210
It's not
about the lawyers.

03:35.250 --> 03:37.888
We have shifted
this situation

03:37.918 --> 03:41.885
From an entire team of boys
facing arrest and prosecution

03:41.915 --> 03:44.543
To just a hysterical mother
taking some last stab

03:44.583 --> 03:45.872
At civil restitution.

03:45.922 --> 03:47.890
We need to manage
public perception.

03:47.920 --> 03:52.258
<i>You do that by welcoming back
a confused young man</i>

03:52.288 --> 03:53.756
Who almost took
his own life.

03:53.786 --> 03:58.423
It's insane you would let your
own biases prevent the school

03:58.453 --> 04:00.912
From taking advantage
of the situation.

04:00.952 --> 04:04.918
Now, don, when you had
your...Issues,

04:04.958 --> 04:06.958
Many of us at the school
were willing to look past --

04:06.988 --> 04:07.947
Don't turn this on me.

04:07.987 --> 04:09.445
If that kid didn't rape
some boy,

04:09.495 --> 04:11.295
He got drunk and had sex
with him at a party.

04:11.325 --> 04:13.123
You don't get to make a hero
out of him.

04:13.163 --> 04:14.932
Handle all of this.
End it now.

04:34.628 --> 04:36.626
Grace.

04:39.134 --> 04:40.104
Yes?

04:40.134 --> 04:42.602
I need to set a meeting
with legal.

04:42.632 --> 04:44.431
And i also need
the assembly.

04:44.470 --> 04:46.100
I want to keep that
on the schedule.

04:46.140 --> 04:48.938
The assembly?
The assembly
for eric tanner. Yes.

04:48.968 --> 04:52.266
And i also need a writer --
a really good one.

04:52.306 --> 04:54.604
If he's openly gay,
that would be best.
Okay.

04:54.634 --> 04:56.092
E-mail the queries
on my behalf.

04:56.142 --> 04:58.271
Make sure you lead
with leyland's commitment

04:58.301 --> 04:59.930
To inclusiveness.

04:59.970 --> 05:01.598
The people from the seminar
called again.

05:01.638 --> 05:03.638
Which?
They want you speak
at that,

05:03.678 --> 05:06.105
Uh, crisis management
in the age of social media.

05:06.145 --> 05:07.944
As this school
is facing a lawsuit.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.773
Well, they want to
recognize you for it.

05:09.813 --> 05:11.781
With lunch
at the airport ramada.

05:11.811 --> 05:14.050
It's next week -- thursday.
Maybe.

05:14.080 --> 05:16.079
You should go.
It's your kind of people.

05:17.208 --> 05:20.476
Did i catch sarcasm?

05:20.516 --> 05:23.853
Check with somebody. Get me
a writer. Get me one today.

05:33.986 --> 05:36.284
Hey.

05:36.314 --> 05:37.943
You take the car?

05:37.983 --> 05:39.941
I just went
to the rec center.

05:39.981 --> 05:42.110
Well, i need to know
where you are. Okay?

05:42.150 --> 05:44.449
So please don't take the car
without asking.

05:44.488 --> 05:46.457
Hey.
Don't walk away from me.

05:46.487 --> 05:47.626
What?

05:47.656 --> 05:49.125
Well,
i'm trying to talk to you.

05:49.155 --> 05:50.994
What do you
want to talk about?

05:53.152 --> 05:54.951
Shower up
and get dressed.

05:54.991 --> 05:56.290
I'll drop you two off
at school.

05:56.320 --> 05:57.619
I don't want to ride
with him.

05:57.659 --> 05:58.958
Well, you got to get
to school.

05:58.988 --> 06:00.447
Not with him.
I don't want to be around him.

06:00.487 --> 06:02.116
Mom doesn't --
peter!

06:02.156 --> 06:03.315
Enough.

06:03.355 --> 06:06.423
Just take him.
I'll get to school on my own.

06:12.858 --> 06:15.316
The school
has answered the complaint.

06:15.366 --> 06:17.665
They've either denied or
admitted insufficient knowledge

06:17.695 --> 06:19.833
To admit or deny
each complaint.

06:21.032 --> 06:22.162
I mean, what else
are they gonna do?

06:22.202 --> 06:23.231
They can deny it.

06:23.261 --> 06:24.890
That doesn't mean
it didn't happen.

06:24.930 --> 06:26.888
They've also set
for an affirmative defenses

06:26.928 --> 06:29.387
As to why
they shouldn't be held liable.

06:29.437 --> 06:30.736
Well,
what does that mean?

06:30.766 --> 06:33.373
Reasons the suit
should be dismissed.

06:34.733 --> 06:36.531
The school knew
about the party.

06:36.571 --> 06:38.999
They knew about the drinking.
They knew things were wrong.

06:39.039 --> 06:40.339
I mean, i -- there --
there is a way --

06:40.369 --> 06:42.837
A way of doing things
at that school.

06:42.867 --> 06:44.725
You've had one parent
come to you --

06:44.765 --> 06:47.664
One parent who alleged
a cover-up at that school.

06:47.704 --> 06:49.812
If you don't want to go
after this, i'm gonna --
i want to go after this in a way

06:49.842 --> 06:53.310
That actually gets you the
satisfaction you're looking for.

06:53.340 --> 06:57.477
We can take our chances
in court, and it is a chance.

06:57.507 --> 06:59.245
You have one witness
who can support

06:59.275 --> 07:00.914
Some of what your son's
been saying.

07:00.944 --> 07:02.374
Or we can push
for a settlement.

07:02.414 --> 07:04.881
I don't want the money.
I want to get them into court.

07:04.911 --> 07:08.379
Everything they do, how they do
it -- i want it out in public.

07:08.409 --> 07:10.707
That's not gonna happen
if we settle.

07:10.777 --> 07:12.046
Whatever it takes.

07:12.076 --> 07:15.934
At this point,
you know, whatever.

07:22.269 --> 07:24.497
What's up, hmm?

07:27.406 --> 07:29.963
Something's going on?

07:31.143 --> 07:35.709
It's like...
Things are almost real.

07:35.739 --> 07:38.008
Almost?

07:38.048 --> 07:40.946
What's almost, boy?

07:40.976 --> 07:42.235
I mean,
you got a lot going on.

07:42.275 --> 07:45.672
How come you can't
tell me nothing?

07:45.712 --> 07:47.311
I got to go.

07:47.351 --> 07:48.951
You already missed first period.
You might as well hang.

07:48.980 --> 07:52.417
No, i got to...
Go see my therapist.

07:55.086 --> 07:56.155
For what?

07:56.185 --> 07:58.123
I promised my mom.

07:58.153 --> 08:00.123
She, um...

08:00.153 --> 08:02.590
She wants me
to talk about --

08:02.620 --> 08:05.189
About what happened
to me.

08:05.219 --> 08:07.018
Are you still tripping
on that?

08:07.058 --> 08:08.326
For real, the only thing
that happened to you

08:08.356 --> 08:10.925
Is you had
a 3:00 a.M. Hookup.

08:10.955 --> 08:12.723
Look, you went to go hit it
with some dude,

08:12.753 --> 08:15.511
You got lit up,
and you freaked out.

08:15.551 --> 08:17.910
But nothing happened at that
party you didn't want to happen.

08:17.960 --> 08:19.558
You don't know
what happened.

08:19.588 --> 08:21.047
Yeah?

08:24.155 --> 08:26.254
You don't like it rough?

08:31.030 --> 08:33.629
You don't like it
when i do that?

08:48.298 --> 08:50.437
You don't like that?

08:53.804 --> 08:56.103
I don't like it.

09:02.638 --> 09:05.736
Look, just --
just stay with me some.

09:05.766 --> 09:06.895
Okay?

09:09.433 --> 09:11.062
Got to go.

09:14.240 --> 09:16.838
Listen,
i know this hasn't been easy.

09:16.878 --> 09:19.806
But we've got to --

09:19.836 --> 09:22.764
We've all got to get it together
for your brother.

09:22.804 --> 09:25.732
And the family is
how it is.

09:25.772 --> 09:29.339
And this is --
it's hard, but we have t--

09:30.709 --> 09:31.868
What the hell?

09:41.751 --> 09:44.019
What are they --
stupid stuff.

09:51.054 --> 09:52.983
I'm gonna walk you in.

09:53.013 --> 09:54.442
I'm okay.

09:54.482 --> 09:55.940
I'm not gonna let you walk
through all of t--

09:56.020 --> 09:57.919
They've been out there all week.
What do you care now?

10:02.655 --> 10:04.924
How's your mother doing?

10:07.692 --> 10:10.760
She's...

10:10.790 --> 10:12.758
I don't know.

10:13.758 --> 10:16.027
Is she coping?

10:16.057 --> 10:17.645
I don't know.

10:17.695 --> 10:18.994
Most times, she's at work.

10:19.024 --> 10:22.132
When she's not,
she's with lawyers or police,

10:22.162 --> 10:23.761
Someplace except with me.

10:23.791 --> 10:26.219
And how does that
make you feel?

10:26.259 --> 10:27.418
That's such a bull...
Question.

10:27.458 --> 10:31.055
My mom is obsessed
because of what happened to me.

10:31.095 --> 10:33.194
All she does
is try to fight that school

10:33.224 --> 10:34.653
Because
of what happened.

10:34.693 --> 10:36.651
How do you think
that makes me feel?

10:36.691 --> 10:40.889
If i knew the answer,
i wouldn't ask.

10:40.929 --> 10:42.887
It makes me feel...

10:45.735 --> 10:48.003
You don't know
what you're feeling

10:48.033 --> 10:50.502
Or...
You can't describe it?

10:50.532 --> 10:54.129
I just --
i want to know when

10:54.169 --> 10:56.768
I can start
to move away from it.

10:56.808 --> 10:57.837
My mom won't let me.

10:57.867 --> 11:02.294
I'm...I'm seeing a guy,
and he doesn't get it.

11:02.334 --> 11:04.632
And the thing that...

11:04.672 --> 11:06.940
Look, if i --

11:06.970 --> 11:08.899
If i got dragged
in an alley somewhere,

11:08.939 --> 11:11.547
I co-- i could just stop
walking past that alley.

11:11.576 --> 11:16.313
But this ass...Who did what
he did -- he -- you know, he --

11:16.343 --> 11:17.972
Pictures still come up
that he is in.

11:18.012 --> 11:20.611
I still see posts that he's
commented on, that he's liked.

11:20.640 --> 11:23.538
He -- you know, he doesn't hide
from what he did.

11:23.578 --> 11:24.678
He doesn't have to.

11:24.708 --> 11:26.137
He's -- he's in my space.
He's on my phone.

11:26.177 --> 11:28.804
Without even trying,

11:28.844 --> 11:35.379
He gets to do what he did to me
again every day.

11:35.409 --> 11:37.369
What did he do?

11:42.415 --> 11:45.053
Have you been doing
any of your exercises?

11:46.582 --> 11:47.642
No.

11:47.682 --> 11:49.440
It's part
of your therapy.

11:49.480 --> 11:51.748
it's a waste.

11:51.788 --> 11:52.888
You're having problems

11:52.918 --> 11:55.016
Articulating the things
that you're feeling,

11:55.056 --> 11:57.983
What you've been through.

11:58.023 --> 11:59.953
And writing it in some book
does what?

11:59.983 --> 12:02.111
Expressing yourself in a journal
gives a name

12:02.151 --> 12:04.250
To what you have to confront,
and you need to confront

12:04.320 --> 12:05.749
Everything
that you're dealing with.

12:05.789 --> 12:09.226
You don't want to let yourself
get overwhelmed by the stress.

12:09.256 --> 12:10.725
Are you saying that
'cause of my mom?

12:10.755 --> 12:14.182
I'm saying it
because that's how it happens.

12:14.222 --> 12:16.651
And...And how do you know
that this --

12:16.691 --> 12:19.618
This journal thing
does any good?

12:19.658 --> 12:21.917
I've been practicing
psychiatry for --

12:21.957 --> 12:23.416
Yeah. You study.
You practice.

12:23.466 --> 12:29.202
But have you ever had to get
a little book and write down

12:29.232 --> 12:31.030
All the bad things
that happened to you one night?

12:31.060 --> 12:33.889
<i>I didn't have to get
a book.</i>

12:33.929 --> 12:35.727
I've had several.

13:07.775 --> 13:09.713
The allegation
basically thrives

13:09.743 --> 13:11.711
On the substantiation
of one witness --

13:11.741 --> 13:13.840
The accuser's girlfriend.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.479
She wasn't there
when it happened.

13:15.509 --> 13:17.148
She saw taylor
directly before

13:17.178 --> 13:19.277
And directly after
the alleged assault.

13:19.307 --> 13:22.234
She can speak to his physical
state and his state of mind.

13:22.274 --> 13:23.904
She claims he was
emotionally distraught

13:23.944 --> 13:25.372
And physically
incapacitated.

13:25.412 --> 13:27.211
She's his girlfriend,
not a doctor.

13:27.251 --> 13:29.520
How much weight is anybody
gonna put on what she says?

13:29.550 --> 13:31.848
Her story has been
unwavering.

13:31.878 --> 13:34.405
And she would play well
in the court of public opinion.

13:34.485 --> 13:37.314
Look, from a simple
legal perspective,

13:37.354 --> 13:40.121
This, uh, "tradition"
at the captains' party --

13:40.151 --> 13:41.421
"making the team"...
Mm.

13:41.451 --> 13:43.589
...It was an excuse
for students to have sex.

13:43.619 --> 13:45.418
If people connected
to the school knew that,

13:45.448 --> 13:47.207
That is failure
to protect.

13:47.257 --> 13:48.726
One good witness --

13:48.756 --> 13:50.854
That's the wedge
that cracks everything open.

13:50.884 --> 13:53.013
So discussing
a settlement...

13:53.053 --> 13:54.811
Mm. I sat across
from that woman.

13:54.851 --> 13:56.650
She's not gonna
take the money.

13:56.690 --> 13:58.329
Put a check
in front of people,

13:58.359 --> 13:59.788
Their opinions aren't always
as resolute.

13:59.818 --> 14:01.946
She wants us to bleed
in public.

14:01.986 --> 14:05.584
It's a settlement or it's court.
That's pretty much it.

14:07.962 --> 14:10.590
This can be handled.

14:10.630 --> 14:14.227
It just...It can.

14:14.257 --> 14:16.156
And these people think
they can't be touched.

14:16.196 --> 14:18.764
They think they can do whatever
they want to whoever they want

14:18.794 --> 14:21.433
And nobody's gonna do
anything about it.

14:21.463 --> 14:23.101
It's not my problem.

14:23.131 --> 14:25.769
You know,
your daughter got hurt, too.

14:25.799 --> 14:28.268
By your boy.
He lied to her.

14:28.298 --> 14:31.435
He's confused
about himself.

14:31.465 --> 14:36.771
He -- i know that he cares
about evy.

14:36.801 --> 14:39.939
I had the father of a girl
sit and tell me

14:39.969 --> 14:43.107
About how his daughter
got abused by that school,

14:43.137 --> 14:45.605
And they protected
the teacher that did it.

14:45.635 --> 14:47.274
I mean, this stuff
keeps happening.

14:47.304 --> 14:48.942
We got to do something
about it.

14:48.972 --> 14:51.941
You keep putting this on us.
This is not even our school.

14:51.971 --> 14:53.509
I know.

14:53.539 --> 14:58.346
I just want to know that
i have your help, evy's help.

14:58.376 --> 15:01.045
I've got to get back
to work.

15:27.455 --> 15:30.194
I want to help kids.

15:30.224 --> 15:31.363
I want to do what's right
for them.

15:31.393 --> 15:34.790
I want to teach.
I want to be in class.

15:34.820 --> 15:37.748
This is a bad position
to be in.

15:37.788 --> 15:39.717
I mean, every day
i have to cross that line,

15:39.757 --> 15:41.516
To a lot of people,
it looks like i'm --

15:41.596 --> 15:43.664
Looks like what?

15:43.694 --> 15:45.632
Looks like
you're doing your job?

15:45.662 --> 15:47.062
Looks like
i'm a traitor.

15:47.092 --> 15:49.990
Who's saying that?

15:50.029 --> 15:51.999
I have a responsibility
to do what's right.

15:52.029 --> 15:54.127
Then there's
no problem.

15:56.135 --> 15:58.334
If the cops do something bad
to a black kid and black people

15:58.364 --> 16:00.292
Start protesting,
you're gonna cross that line?

16:00.332 --> 16:02.431
this is not
even close to the same thing.

16:02.470 --> 16:03.541
Isn't it?

16:03.571 --> 16:05.569
Disciplining three kids
who got into a fight --

16:05.599 --> 16:07.527
That's the same as a black kid
getting shot in the street?

16:07.567 --> 16:09.936
I'm saying -- you wouldn't do it
for your people?

16:09.966 --> 16:13.223
Everybody in this school --
they're all "my people."

16:13.273 --> 16:15.202
Not the ones
who got kicked out.

16:19.039 --> 16:23.106
So,
i'm here to reach kids.

16:23.136 --> 16:26.064
I can't do that if
i'm on the wrong side of things.

16:26.104 --> 16:29.502
I'm gonna take a couple days,
take some time off.

16:29.542 --> 16:30.711
When things
settle down --

16:30.741 --> 16:33.209
If you're going to stand there
and willfully tell me

16:33.239 --> 16:36.167
You're taking time,
i'm going to have you dismissed.

16:36.207 --> 16:38.835
Well, i got a union,
so you won't be doing that.

16:52.615 --> 16:55.054
Things have changed.

16:55.084 --> 16:59.021
I've been through a whole lot
these last couple of weeks.

16:59.050 --> 17:03.288
And i can't pretend that i'm
the same person i was before...

17:04.746 --> 17:07.015
...Before all this,
but that's the thing.

17:07.055 --> 17:11.621
I don't have to pretend
anymore.

17:11.651 --> 17:13.880
That's what's great
about being back here --

17:13.920 --> 17:15.019
I can be who i am.

17:17.488 --> 17:21.555
Everybody here --
the team, coach dan, the --

17:21.585 --> 17:23.513
The staff and --
and everybody --

17:23.554 --> 17:27.050
All they care about is --

17:27.090 --> 17:30.329
All th-- all they care about
is that respect and dignity

17:30.359 --> 17:31.957
And that every person
can be the person,

17:31.987 --> 17:33.916
The s-- the student --

17:33.956 --> 17:38.752
Every student can be
the person that they really are.

17:40.292 --> 17:43.889
I'm thankful to my coach
and my team

17:43.929 --> 17:47.697
And...To the school for --

17:47.726 --> 17:50.654
For giving me the chance,
for the first time in my life,

17:50.694 --> 17:54.092
To really be eric tanner.

18:00.597 --> 18:03.695
You know,
let him hear it, huh?

18:03.735 --> 18:05.674
yeah.

18:05.704 --> 18:07.342
Yeah.

18:09.741 --> 18:12.738
Let him hear it, guys.
Let him hear it!

18:17.735 --> 18:20.504
Eric is about
the bravest young man i know.

18:20.543 --> 18:24.540
And it is so good
to have him back as a student,

18:24.570 --> 18:26.329
Back as part of the team.

18:26.379 --> 18:29.477
And i just -- i just want to
remind all of you that you're --

18:29.507 --> 18:32.105
You're a big part of this team,
as well.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.114
And it's gonna take all...

18:33.144 --> 18:36.581
How does it feel?

18:36.611 --> 18:39.210
How does it feel
to be back?

18:39.250 --> 18:40.679
Uh...It feels okay.

18:40.709 --> 18:42.507
Yes?
Yeah.

18:42.547 --> 18:46.584
Well, we're happy that you're
back, that you're healthy.

18:46.614 --> 18:49.213
The things
that you've been through --

18:49.253 --> 18:51.681
Well, what that family
put you through --

18:51.711 --> 18:53.639
Nobody should have to deal
with that. Nobody.

18:53.679 --> 18:54.809
But...

18:57.147 --> 18:58.576
But we're dealing
with ignorance,

18:58.616 --> 19:02.214
And the only way to deal with
ignorance is through education.

19:02.254 --> 19:04.522
People -- they just -- they --
sure.

19:04.552 --> 19:08.789
They're scared of what
they don't understand.

19:08.819 --> 19:12.247
We have the opportunity
to do something about that.

19:12.287 --> 19:13.586
There's a writer.

19:13.626 --> 19:16.493
He does online pieces about
young men who are coming out --

19:16.523 --> 19:20.291
Their difficulties, their
struggles, their success.

19:20.321 --> 19:22.079
He'd really like
to speak with you.

19:22.129 --> 19:23.389
A-about what?

19:23.429 --> 19:27.196
About your experience
as an openly gay athlete.

19:27.226 --> 19:29.664
Uh, i haven't had
any experience.

19:29.694 --> 19:30.963
You've literally
survived

19:30.993 --> 19:33.601
More than a lot of young people
in your situation have.

19:33.631 --> 19:36.559
That means something.

19:36.599 --> 19:38.867
Anyway, he's excited
to talk to you.

19:38.897 --> 19:40.996
We'll have him here
ahead of the game.

19:41.026 --> 19:44.254
You'll do fine.

20:12.204 --> 20:14.133
Well, that's a good way
to get shot.

20:14.173 --> 20:15.972
Got the spare key
from mom.

20:16.011 --> 20:17.640
Don't you have school?

20:17.670 --> 20:19.129
Yeah.

20:19.179 --> 20:22.577
Don't put me in the position
of having to cover you.

20:22.607 --> 20:23.906
I-i can leave.

20:23.945 --> 20:26.844
I could just go run the streets
or whatever.

20:26.874 --> 20:29.132
well,
if you're gonna do bad things,

20:29.182 --> 20:30.481
You can just go ahead
and do them.

20:30.511 --> 20:32.150
You don't have to come here
and announce them.

20:35.307 --> 20:37.606
You didn't even snatch yourself
a beer?

20:37.646 --> 20:40.284
Is that how much
of a bad boy you are?

20:51.446 --> 20:53.744
So...?

20:55.783 --> 20:58.381
I-i wanted to talk.

20:58.421 --> 21:01.020
I'm listening.

21:01.050 --> 21:02.478
I messed up.

21:02.518 --> 21:03.478
How?

21:03.518 --> 21:05.276
Lied.

21:05.316 --> 21:06.816
About?

21:14.460 --> 21:17.898
Taylor, your mom doesn't care
if you like girls or not

21:17.928 --> 21:19.526
Or if you're --

21:19.556 --> 21:22.814
Nobody who cares anything
about you gives a damn,

21:22.864 --> 21:24.793
This way or that.

21:24.823 --> 21:28.920
Now, it would be easy
for me to say

21:28.960 --> 21:31.588
That you should have told
your mother the truth

21:31.628 --> 21:37.623
About...Being...
How you are.

21:37.663 --> 21:42.600
But -- but she's strong,
and she can take it.

21:42.630 --> 21:44.728
She's got problems.

21:44.768 --> 21:46.737
You know that.

21:46.767 --> 21:49.535
She's not
how she was before.

21:49.565 --> 21:50.694
This, i do know.

21:50.734 --> 21:52.004
She's never home.

21:52.034 --> 21:55.331
She, um...

21:55.371 --> 21:56.641
She can't let go.

21:56.671 --> 21:59.138
They're making her...

21:59.168 --> 22:02.426
They are making her crazy.

22:02.476 --> 22:07.242
She's doing what she's doing
because she loves you.

22:07.272 --> 22:12.509
The people who love you --
nothing changes for us.

22:12.539 --> 22:15.637
Remember we used to go
to the colts' games?

22:16.876 --> 22:19.014
Every time you could,
you'd take me.
Yes.

22:19.044 --> 22:21.682
Remember
we stopped going?

22:21.742 --> 22:24.000
Well, you --
you stopped wanting to go.

22:24.040 --> 22:25.970
Do you know why?

22:26.010 --> 22:27.468
They were playing
the packers one time.

22:27.508 --> 22:30.136
They were getting --
getting killed.

22:30.176 --> 22:34.103
And you started screaming,
"stop playing like queers.

22:34.143 --> 22:36.772
Quit playing like a bunch
of queers," loud as you could,

22:36.812 --> 22:38.610
Over and over,
right in front of my face.

22:38.650 --> 22:41.618
Same man who spent
eight months raising me,

22:41.648 --> 22:45.106
Screaming about queers.

22:45.146 --> 22:48.774
Do you remember that game,
nate?

22:48.813 --> 22:50.312
I remember that game.

22:50.352 --> 22:53.319
Why are you
telling me this?

22:53.349 --> 22:54.649
I'm talking with someone,

22:54.689 --> 22:59.656
And he tells me i've got
to...Confront things.

22:59.686 --> 23:05.182
So...
I'm confronting things.

23:30.893 --> 23:32.022
.
Hmm.

23:32.052 --> 23:35.320
Us being apart now --
the boys ask for you.

23:35.360 --> 23:38.098
they do. They ask.

23:38.128 --> 23:41.056
If you were here --
if i was here, w-what?

23:41.096 --> 23:43.694
W-w-what would it do?

23:43.724 --> 23:45.823
I have been here
17 years,

23:45.863 --> 23:49.929
And -- and that one --
he tried to kill himself.

23:49.959 --> 23:52.218
He is gay.
He raped some other boy.

23:52.258 --> 23:55.356
He -- he said
it was consensual.

23:55.396 --> 23:59.303
You know what
i keep thinking?

23:59.333 --> 24:04.739
I keep thinking
if peter hadn't been there

24:04.769 --> 24:09.836
When eric took those pills,
if he hadn't...Found him...

24:09.866 --> 24:12.124
I do.

24:12.164 --> 24:14.093
I think that.

24:14.133 --> 24:19.029
We could have at least
buried him as our son.

24:19.070 --> 24:21.508
We can't even take him
to church anymore.

24:21.538 --> 24:23.136
Then we should be
at a different church.

24:23.166 --> 24:26.095
No, we should have been
at church more.

24:26.134 --> 24:27.893
And you should
have been around more.

24:27.943 --> 24:30.871
You should have taught him
how to be a man.

24:30.911 --> 24:33.679
And now he does this --
you just -- you accept it.

24:33.709 --> 24:34.748
No.

24:34.778 --> 24:36.907
I-if he drank,
y-you wouldn't take it.

24:36.947 --> 24:39.545
If he stole,
you wouldn't let him.
We need to help him.

24:39.575 --> 24:41.803
That's the only way
we can make him better.

24:41.843 --> 24:42.883
Better? H-how?

24:42.913 --> 24:44.182
If we -- if we get him
into counseling --

24:44.212 --> 24:45.680
How does he get better?

24:45.710 --> 24:48.479
This thing --
it doesn't go away.

24:48.509 --> 24:51.576
They don't get better.

25:00.011 --> 25:02.139
Did you ever touch him?

25:05.317 --> 25:06.915
What?

25:06.955 --> 25:07.915
Did you --

25:07.955 --> 25:09.883
Why would...

25:09.913 --> 25:12.382
...How could you...?

25:12.422 --> 25:14.350
They get it
from somewhere.

25:14.390 --> 25:18.627
<i>You think he's sick.
You think i'm sick.
They get this from somewhere.</i>

25:18.657 --> 25:21.425
You want to blame someone?
You want to blame people?

25:21.455 --> 25:23.394
You have pushed those kids
away from you.

25:23.424 --> 25:25.522
This last year,
you have shoved them away.

25:25.552 --> 25:28.820
But work was always first
for you.
I know i've had my crap, too.

25:28.860 --> 25:33.096
You do...For a living,
but that always came first.
I know, but this is where
we got to get it together.

25:33.126 --> 25:35.865
This is where we've got
to figure it out for them!

25:35.895 --> 25:38.662
Th-- that woman's
trying to sue us.

25:38.722 --> 25:40.122
She's trying to sue
everybody.

25:40.162 --> 25:44.129
Everybody else has got lawyers
and money.

25:44.159 --> 25:45.718
What does she want?

25:45.758 --> 25:49.025
We don't have anything
to take.

25:49.065 --> 25:52.833
I go back
to a-a crap apartment.

25:52.863 --> 25:58.729
I just sit there with everything
i have ever done wrong.

25:58.769 --> 26:03.036
I...
Just want to start over.

26:04.634 --> 26:07.403
I just want to...

26:07.433 --> 26:13.511
I just --
i want to start everything over.

26:36.453 --> 26:37.581
Kevin.

26:37.621 --> 26:40.385
She's going after kevin?

26:40.415 --> 26:43.011
He's 18.
She named him independently.

26:43.041 --> 26:44.668
Well, the police
didn't do anything.

26:44.708 --> 26:45.966
If there's nothing there
for them, then what --

26:46.006 --> 26:48.272
How long does she get
to keep doing this, huh?

26:48.312 --> 26:50.777
How long does she get to keep
going after our child?

26:50.807 --> 26:52.404
If we can get this
dismissed --

26:52.434 --> 26:54.861
And if we can't,
then what?

26:54.900 --> 26:56.527
Can we do anything
for kevin?

26:56.567 --> 26:59.792
Can we even protect him?

27:02.497 --> 27:04.134
The hard drive's damaged --
probably a head crash.

27:04.164 --> 27:05.931
Does that mean it's all --
the read/write head

27:05.961 --> 27:07.588
Scratched the drive
and it's got a bad sector.

27:07.628 --> 27:09.225
Did i lose everything?

27:09.255 --> 27:10.713
Not everything.

27:10.763 --> 27:13.029
I-i got -- i got family stuff
on there. I got kids' pictures.

27:13.058 --> 27:15.025
If the information's in there,
the information's good.

27:15.055 --> 27:16.822
I-i just got to
get it out.

27:16.852 --> 27:18.649
Just give me
a day or two.

27:18.689 --> 27:19.717
Okay.

27:41.139 --> 27:44.064
Mia!

27:44.104 --> 27:46.300
Mia, bring mercy!
It's time to eat!

27:46.330 --> 27:49.255
If 2 minus "i" is a zero

27:49.295 --> 27:52.090
And the coefficients
of the polynomial are real...

27:53.557 --> 27:55.314
You see
how that works?

27:55.354 --> 27:57.451
no.

27:57.491 --> 27:59.128
You don't see
how that works?

27:59.158 --> 28:02.323
We did this one
yesterday.

28:04.219 --> 28:06.485
There you go.

28:08.681 --> 28:10.478
How many words
you got right there?

28:12.015 --> 28:13.613
You did it.

28:13.643 --> 28:16.597
Smart, just like dad.

29:06.300 --> 29:09.424
Yeah, tuesday and wednesday
are the best.

29:09.464 --> 29:11.591
Friday, saturday,
i can't do.

29:11.631 --> 29:14.525
Your son is a whore!

29:14.565 --> 29:15.604
Admit it.

29:15.634 --> 29:17.431
He got drunk and had sex
with another boy.

29:17.461 --> 29:19.157
Ma'am.
You need to go.

29:19.197 --> 29:21.294
<i>And you don't even care about
what you're doing to my son.
You need to go!</i>

29:21.324 --> 29:22.781
Right now!
You're gonna get what's yours.

29:22.821 --> 29:24.279
You need to go right now!
You're gonna
get what you des...

29:30.118 --> 29:32.414
Ma'am, you got i.D.?
Why?

29:32.454 --> 29:34.950
Can i see your i.D.,
please?

29:45.112 --> 29:47.578
We got a call about a
disturbance at this restaurant.

29:47.608 --> 29:48.905
You wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

29:48.935 --> 29:51.401
No.

29:51.441 --> 29:53.737
Okay, if you don't have
any business here,

29:53.767 --> 29:56.063
Might want to move on,
ms. Lacroix.

29:56.103 --> 29:58.070
I wasn't doing anything.

29:58.099 --> 30:00.731
Got nothing to do,
might as well head home.

30:55.183 --> 30:57.951
How does all this
make you feel?

30:57.981 --> 31:00.240
With everything's that happened,
how does it feel?

31:00.280 --> 31:02.210
people keep asking me that.

31:02.250 --> 31:03.849
And...?

31:03.889 --> 31:07.158
And i keep telling them,
"how's what supposed to feel?"

31:07.188 --> 31:09.586
Well, to be falsely accused
of assault,

31:09.627 --> 31:12.225
To be an openly gay athlete,
to be a role model --

31:12.256 --> 31:13.255
What's that mean to you?

31:13.295 --> 31:16.224
I'm trying not to think
about all that.

31:16.264 --> 31:17.534
But that's what
everybody else is doing.

31:17.564 --> 31:20.503
All of a sudden, everybody's
making a big deal of it.

31:20.533 --> 31:21.662
I don't get it.

31:21.692 --> 31:22.791
Do you think
you've made it easier

31:22.831 --> 31:24.101
For other gay athletes
to come out?

31:24.131 --> 31:25.730
I don't know.

31:25.770 --> 31:28.668
Probably not.

31:28.698 --> 31:29.828
They see all this attention
i'm getting,

31:29.868 --> 31:31.008
They might
want to hide out more

31:31.038 --> 31:33.336
Since all anyone wants
to talk about is how i'm gay.

31:33.366 --> 31:35.896
<i>You are gay.
That's not it.</i>

31:35.936 --> 31:38.034
But your coming out
makes a statement. So,
if you had a message --

31:38.074 --> 31:40.344
One thing to say
to your fellow gay athletes...
Look, i'm just
getting back to school.

31:40.374 --> 31:43.014
...Who's hiding their truth from
the world, what would that be?
I'm just dealing with this.

31:43.044 --> 31:45.941
How come, all of a sudden, i got
to speak up for every gay kid?

31:45.982 --> 31:47.612
I've got nothing to say
to them.

31:47.642 --> 31:49.440
I'm gay,
but i'm not a faggot.

31:51.749 --> 31:55.048
Everyone handles
things differently.

31:55.079 --> 31:58.178
Right now, eric obviously
isn't ready to handle

31:58.218 --> 32:00.815
The responsibility of speaking
to his circumstance.

32:00.855 --> 32:02.155
Look,
he said what he said.

32:02.185 --> 32:05.113
He's a 17-year-old boy
who has been through a lot.

32:05.153 --> 32:07.753
It doesn't serve him,
it doesn't serve anybody

32:07.793 --> 32:10.392
For him to be judged
by one unfortunate --

32:10.422 --> 32:12.051
The "f" word
is unfortunate?

32:12.091 --> 32:14.850
It --
by one comment.

32:14.890 --> 32:17.488
Why give people who are
unaccepting of open athletes

32:17.528 --> 32:20.167
An excuse to be intolerant?

32:22.166 --> 32:23.966
I'll hold it back.

32:26.135 --> 32:28.274
It's the right thing to do.

32:28.304 --> 32:30.543
Our kids
need to be treated fair.

32:30.573 --> 32:32.343
Yeah.

32:32.373 --> 32:34.972
How's it look, you just
suspending the latinos?

32:35.002 --> 32:37.300
Looks like you're favoring
the black kids to me.

32:37.340 --> 32:39.640
and for what?

32:39.680 --> 32:40.780
A fight?

32:40.810 --> 32:43.447
It's not a fight
when three guys jump one guy.

32:43.477 --> 32:45.248
It's assault.

32:45.278 --> 32:49.535
Now, the boys were suspended for
their actions, not their race.

32:49.585 --> 32:52.854
Look, i don't want to
punish kids, okay?

32:52.884 --> 32:54.824
I-i want to solve
the problem.

32:54.854 --> 32:56.951
<i>Then you need to stand up
for what's right,</i>

32:56.982 --> 32:58.242
Not for what's black.

33:00.751 --> 33:02.880
Y'all need to respect.

33:02.920 --> 33:04.449
If you handled
your kids better --

33:04.489 --> 33:05.958
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
L-listen, it's not about that.

33:05.988 --> 33:07.948
You pull our kids out of school,
you suspend them,

33:07.988 --> 33:10.417
You were name calling.
No, i wasn't, sir. I was --

33:10.456 --> 33:12.556
You were against feeding
our kids.
That's a lie.

33:12.596 --> 33:13.695
When's it going to stop?

33:13.725 --> 33:17.155
Look...

33:17.195 --> 33:20.462
Look, i-i know how
it may feel to you,

33:20.502 --> 33:24.101
But you need to understand
i'm trying to do what's right.

33:24.131 --> 33:26.760
My daughter joined the protest
to speak her mind,

33:26.800 --> 33:28.559
And now she's facing
truancy court.

33:28.599 --> 33:29.898
She cut school.

33:29.939 --> 33:31.638
For holding up a sign.

33:31.668 --> 33:34.936
Any student who's not attending
class is marked absent.

33:34.976 --> 33:37.116
That's a district rule,
and that's beyond me.

33:37.146 --> 33:38.575
That's true.

33:38.605 --> 33:40.434
You're the principal here.
How is that beyond you?

33:40.474 --> 33:43.074
You keep saying
you want to do right.

33:43.114 --> 33:45.152
How is any of this right?

33:45.182 --> 33:46.152
Look, i want to -- yes --

33:46.182 --> 33:48.021
You're absolu--

33:49.381 --> 33:52.010
You did the right thing,
holding the meeting.

33:52.049 --> 33:53.379
What you don't
want to do is

33:53.419 --> 33:54.859
You don't want to look like
you're running and hiding.

33:54.889 --> 33:56.018
You've just got
to confront these --

33:56.058 --> 33:57.856
I'm not looking
for confrontation.

33:57.886 --> 34:01.495
You've got to engage folks
directly, and you did.

34:01.525 --> 34:04.494
I actually think some good
is gonna come out of this.

34:04.524 --> 34:07.133
People don't deal with issues
until they're in front of them,

34:07.163 --> 34:08.262
And now it's in front
of them.

34:08.292 --> 34:09.920
So now this is an issue.

34:09.962 --> 34:13.061
It's not an issue.
It's a reason to engage.

34:13.101 --> 34:14.731
You saw some of them

34:14.761 --> 34:17.059
Were bringing up
the breakfast program --

34:17.099 --> 34:19.067
How you got me to sign off
on changing it.

34:19.097 --> 34:21.556
Chris, compared to what they're
dealing with over at leyland,

34:21.597 --> 34:24.067
We look thoughtful
and reasonable.

34:24.137 --> 34:25.277
If this was gonna happen,

34:25.306 --> 34:27.444
It couldn't have happened
at a better time.

34:29.804 --> 34:32.303
Get some rest.

34:35.440 --> 34:37.900
Yeah.

34:43.478 --> 34:45.577
Come on!
Do something with it!

34:45.607 --> 34:48.047
Eric's open down low!

34:48.077 --> 34:49.976
Come on!

34:52.715 --> 34:55.612
What are you doing?!
He was wide open!

35:06.219 --> 35:08.318
Bitches!
 Yeah, bitches!

35:08.358 --> 35:09.958
Fags!

35:09.987 --> 35:12.586
 Is that your version
of "play ball"?!

35:12.626 --> 35:14.026
Man #4:
Way to go, ladies!

35:14.056 --> 35:15.485
gayland high school!

35:16.724 --> 35:19.953
Gayland high school!

35:19.993 --> 35:23.152
Gayland high school!

35:31.338 --> 35:33.307
Anybody else
want to eat?

35:33.337 --> 35:35.536
Uh, yeah, sure.
If you guys are going --

35:36.876 --> 35:39.344
Oh, he's got things to do,
right?

35:39.374 --> 35:41.614
Let him handle
his business.

35:41.644 --> 35:43.912
Come on.

36:13.761 --> 36:15.860
I'm sick of this, man.

36:15.891 --> 36:17.649
It's like a circus,
you know?

36:17.699 --> 36:18.969
Like a --
like a freak show.

36:18.999 --> 36:20.928
Got us standing there,
smiling and waving for what?

36:20.968 --> 36:22.736
Because some dude gets off
on dudes?

36:22.766 --> 36:24.536
And then we got the other team
jawing us like we some bitches.

36:24.566 --> 36:26.035
No, man. He's the one.

36:26.065 --> 36:27.025
Eric?

36:27.065 --> 36:29.224
No, man. Eric is --
eric is eric.

36:29.264 --> 36:30.823
I'm talking
about the other one.

36:30.873 --> 36:34.812
He came in there like some bitch
trying to get turned out.

36:34.872 --> 36:36.142
Look, my mom told me,

36:36.172 --> 36:38.600
"bitches always
trying to play you, always.

36:38.641 --> 36:40.109
Always trying to play you,
kevin."

36:40.140 --> 36:42.239
And that dude
is a straight bitch.

36:42.279 --> 36:46.217
He outted eric,
put my name out there...

36:46.247 --> 36:48.186
Bitches, man.

36:48.216 --> 36:49.516
And you know what
the messed up part is?

36:49.546 --> 36:52.305
It doesn't matter
how crazy they are,

36:52.385 --> 36:54.154
You got to treat them
like they're real people.

36:54.184 --> 36:56.123
You have to.

36:56.153 --> 36:57.582
Back in the day,
it would be like, "bop, bop."

36:57.622 --> 36:58.992
Handle your business.
It's done.

36:59.022 --> 37:00.122
for real, man.

37:00.151 --> 37:01.381
But now, man, it's just --

37:01.421 --> 37:04.690
Bitches just get to act
how they act.

37:04.720 --> 37:07.789
And you can't do nothing.

37:07.829 --> 37:09.428
Except he's not --
he's not a bitch, man.

37:09.458 --> 37:10.587
He's a dude,
so there's, like,

37:10.627 --> 37:13.395
No reason
that he can't get handled.

37:15.096 --> 37:17.364
I'm out, bro.

37:17.394 --> 37:18.923
I'm gonna catch y'all later.

37:18.963 --> 37:20.562
All right.

37:20.603 --> 37:22.002
Catch up
with you later, man.

37:59.317 --> 38:01.446
Hello.

38:01.485 --> 38:04.584
It's eric.

38:04.624 --> 38:07.693
Yeah.

38:07.723 --> 38:10.981
We need to talk.

38:11.061 --> 38:15.300
We need to talk about --
about what happened.

38:15.330 --> 38:17.599
I know what happened.

38:17.629 --> 38:20.228
<i>Yeah,
you do know what happened.</i>

38:20.268 --> 38:22.367
You do know.

38:22.397 --> 38:25.327
People are getting messed
by this. Real messed up.

38:25.366 --> 38:28.335
You and me
got to deal with it.

38:32.073 --> 38:34.342
I'm gonna be
at the rec center.

38:34.372 --> 38:38.140
Don't be a bitch.
Come around.

38:43.718 --> 38:45.988
It's all good.
It's for the team.

38:46.018 --> 38:47.688
All right, man?
Yeah.

39:07.128 --> 39:08.098
Mike o'brien.

39:08.128 --> 39:09.298
Mike, it's leslie.

39:09.328 --> 39:11.257
I think -- i think it's time
we start discussing

39:11.297 --> 39:13.136
An offer of settlement.

40:00.397 --> 40:03.695
The decent are the ones
who suffer.

40:03.725 --> 40:06.484
The good ones
just keep getting hurt.

40:06.525 --> 40:08.453
Terri's a good one.

40:08.493 --> 40:12.792
She's strong -- stronger
than me, half the time.

40:12.832 --> 40:13.922
And kevin...

40:14.001 --> 40:16.899
This woman --
she's trying to sue our son.

40:16.939 --> 40:19.509
What type of person
goes after a child?

40:19.539 --> 40:22.637
And this is supposed to be
his best year.

40:22.667 --> 40:26.266
Now he'll have to carry these
lies and accusations with him

40:26.306 --> 40:29.505
For the rest of his life.

40:29.545 --> 40:33.983
My family's my life.

40:34.013 --> 40:38.781
The one thing that i can do is
provide and protect, be a man.

40:38.811 --> 40:43.109
I used to think get
an education, get your money,

40:43.149 --> 40:45.578
And nothing can hurt
your family.

40:45.618 --> 40:47.587
It is not like that.

40:47.617 --> 40:51.286
I've done nothing for my family
except let all of this happen.

40:52.954 --> 40:56.753
So...

40:56.793 --> 41:01.431
I need to start doing things,
you understand?

41:04.030 --> 41:06.498
No one's clean.

41:06.529 --> 41:10.328
And everyone has things
they want to keep hidden.

41:10.398 --> 41:13.157
But it's out there.

41:13.197 --> 41:15.995
That's just the world
we live in.

41:16.035 --> 41:17.665
Michael, i'm a cop.

41:17.705 --> 41:19.174
What you're asking --

41:19.204 --> 41:20.243
It's not for me.

41:22.942 --> 41:25.911
It's for terri.
It's for kevin.

41:25.941 --> 41:29.070
All i'm asking is find a way
to let this woman know

41:30.305 --> 41:36.207
