WEBVTT

00:06.896 --> 00:09.310
[Coco]
All this over a woman?

00:10.655 --> 00:12.241
[George]
Okay, Coco, come on,
we need to focus.

00:12.310 --> 00:13.862
We gotta get
these lines down.

00:13.931 --> 00:15.172
This is very important.
We got an important table read.

00:15.241 --> 00:16.310
Come on.I know.

00:16.379 --> 00:17.724
Are you sure
he's not dead?

00:17.793 --> 00:18.896
He's not dead.

00:18.965 --> 00:20.034
We just put a mirror
under his mouth

00:20.103 --> 00:21.448
a half hour ago,
come on.

00:21.517 --> 00:23.862
Hey, boss, I'm heading
over to GVN to run product.

00:23.931 --> 00:25.344
That means check 'em out.

00:25.413 --> 00:26.931
Tell me more, over here.

00:27.000 --> 00:28.517
Oh, well, basically,
I get to...

00:28.586 --> 00:30.448
Okay, but he's gonna be
working and staying out late.

00:30.517 --> 00:32.172
So, you know where I leave
the key, thank you.

00:32.241 --> 00:33.724
Damn.Mm-hmm.

00:35.172 --> 00:36.379
You're no fun.

00:36.448 --> 00:38.275
That's true.
So here's what I'm thinking.

00:38.344 --> 00:40.448
As a detective during
the day, no accent.

00:40.517 --> 00:41.827
Yes, of course,
we'll get right on it.

00:41.896 --> 00:43.862
And at night, when we bust
a perpetrator

00:43.931 --> 00:45.413
like downtown L.A.,

00:45.482 --> 00:47.103
[with accent]
You're under arrest, estúpid...

00:47.172 --> 00:48.862
And I let it fade out,
estúpid...

00:48.931 --> 00:51.068
Then I will do accent, too.

00:51.137 --> 00:52.551
Uh, forget it.

00:56.758 --> 00:58.551
Yeah, I'm a little nervous
about this table reading.

00:58.620 --> 00:59.586
Yeah?Mmm.

00:59.655 --> 01:00.862
Well, you should be.

01:00.931 --> 01:02.413
Everything is riding
on this.

01:02.482 --> 01:04.068
All the network
honchos will be there.

01:04.137 --> 01:07.068
Yeah, I said I was nervous.
That's not exactly comforting.

01:07.137 --> 01:08.482
Yeah, well,
I want you nervous.

01:08.551 --> 01:10.068
You should be nervous,
I'm nervous.

01:10.137 --> 01:11.310
It's good to be nervous.

01:11.379 --> 01:12.827
It would be weird
if you weren't nervous.

01:12.896 --> 01:14.862
How did you feel right
before the first table read

01:14.931 --> 01:16.206
of "The George Lopez Show"?

01:16.275 --> 01:17.517
[sighs]

01:17.586 --> 01:19.103
Like I was gonna
throw up my soul.

01:19.172 --> 01:20.586
That's what
I'm looking for.

01:20.655 --> 01:21.965
Then I'm on track.

01:22.034 --> 01:23.310
Can you make sure
that Pfeiffer

01:23.379 --> 01:24.862
has the scene
all mapped out nice?

01:24.931 --> 01:27.551
Unfortunately, Pfeiffer is
no longer with the organization.

01:27.620 --> 01:28.931
She wishes you well.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.206
But I will take
care of that.

01:30.275 --> 01:31.724
What? Wait a minute,
what organization?

01:31.793 --> 01:34.448
She's your sister.It just wasn't a great fit.

01:34.517 --> 01:36.137
I can see that
but, you know,

01:36.206 --> 01:37.724
Pfeiffer had, like,
a cool vibe,

01:37.793 --> 01:40.068
you know, positive
without being pushy.

01:40.137 --> 01:41.448
Okay, Mom, I get it.

01:41.517 --> 01:43.413
Pfeiffer's a wonderful
free spirit and screw me.

01:43.482 --> 01:44.724
All right, well,
I don't think

01:44.793 --> 01:46.689
you should be--
having any of this.

01:46.758 --> 01:47.965
Yeah, sorry.

01:48.034 --> 01:49.931
My mom is just driving
me really crazy at home.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.172
I gotta get out
of that house.

01:51.241 --> 01:52.793
You do gotta get
out of the house.

01:52.862 --> 01:54.931
But look it, so whether
it's you, Tagine or Pfeiffer,

01:55.000 --> 01:57.137
can you just make sure
that Lori has a good seat?

01:57.206 --> 01:59.379
Like, not close to me
maybe across from me

01:59.448 --> 02:02.275
so she can kind of get
a feel for what I do.

02:02.344 --> 02:04.965
Hm, you want her to see
you doing your thing?

02:05.034 --> 02:06.275
You guys are
kinda tight, huh?

02:06.344 --> 02:07.689
Well, you know, it's...

02:07.758 --> 02:09.620
We're keeping it casual
except for the sex.

02:09.689 --> 02:12.620
♪♪

02:16.551 --> 02:18.275
Let me tell you
something about Pfeiffer.

02:18.344 --> 02:19.586
You need her.

02:19.655 --> 02:20.793
I need her?

02:20.862 --> 02:22.413
I'm the one with
her own business.

02:22.482 --> 02:25.137
A business that sounds like
it's in a precarious place.

02:25.206 --> 02:26.413
Because of her.

02:26.482 --> 02:28.931
Mom, I went to Princeton
and USC.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.551
Pfeiffer went to Bonnaroo.

02:30.620 --> 02:32.241
You've always been
so competitive.

02:32.310 --> 02:33.758
Now go apologize
to your sister

02:33.827 --> 02:35.413
and maybe she'll
come back on board.

02:36.482 --> 02:37.931
Did Dad really kill himself

02:38.000 --> 02:39.724
or was he just trying
to get away from you?

02:39.793 --> 02:41.586
None of your beeswax.

02:41.655 --> 02:43.344
[spits]
I gotta go.

02:44.551 --> 02:48.448
[indistinct chatter]

02:50.241 --> 02:53.655
All right!
Let's hear this!

03:00.896 --> 03:02.517
We open on smog.

03:02.586 --> 03:04.793
It's summer and that
telltale brown curtain

03:04.862 --> 03:06.689
is hanging down
across the mountains.

03:06.758 --> 03:08.379
We see an old muscle car
driving down

03:08.448 --> 03:10.172
Glenoaks Boulevard,
San Fernando.

03:10.241 --> 03:12.551
Behind the wheel
is Paco Campo.

03:12.620 --> 03:15.413
The closest thing to a hero
this place has got.

03:18.068 --> 03:20.827
Paco and Dahlia stand
over the lifeless,

03:20.896 --> 03:23.827
bullet-ridden body
of Sancho Jacinto.

03:23.896 --> 03:25.482
It was messy.

03:25.551 --> 03:28.000
But the world is a better
place without him in it.

03:28.068 --> 03:29.896
At least the Valley is.

03:29.965 --> 03:34.068
They turn their backs on what
they just did and walk away.

03:34.137 --> 03:35.724
Fade out.

03:51.551 --> 03:53.655
[whispering]
Oh, my God, that was...

03:53.724 --> 03:55.172
[normal voice]
You can do this.

03:55.241 --> 03:56.827
You're not in over
your head.

03:56.896 --> 03:58.896
Wow, thanks, is that
your way of telling me
you believe in me?

03:58.965 --> 04:02.379
What I'm trying to say is
you'regoing to win an Emmy.

04:02.448 --> 04:04.241
And Danny's gonna spend
the rest of his life

04:04.310 --> 04:05.551
regretting the day
he lost you.

04:05.620 --> 04:08.275
Lost us.
Us, Olly.

04:08.344 --> 04:10.448
'Kay, that was great.

04:10.517 --> 04:12.034
I mean, just great!

04:12.103 --> 04:14.413
If we could just give our notes,
we'll be good to go.

04:14.482 --> 04:15.793
This shouldn't take long.

04:15.862 --> 04:18.827
Okay, now these are
actually Eric's notes.

04:18.896 --> 04:21.586
But, uh, we see
very little daylight

04:21.655 --> 04:23.241
between his notes
and ours.

04:23.310 --> 04:24.724
Uh, wait a minute, I thought
Eric couldn't make it.

04:24.793 --> 04:26.620
Oh, he couldn't,
but his notes could.

04:26.689 --> 04:27.793
[chuckling]

04:27.862 --> 04:29.482
Yeah, no, he read
this over the weekend.

04:29.551 --> 04:32.689
I mean, George, this show
is a real priority for him.

04:32.758 --> 04:35.034
I mean, obviously,
that was a great read.

04:35.103 --> 04:36.827
Great script,
great acting.

04:36.896 --> 04:39.758
I mean, that is the business
that Eric wants to be in.

04:39.827 --> 04:42.517
Yeah, you know, us too.
[chuckling]Perfect.

04:42.586 --> 04:45.068
Well, then none of these notes
should be a problem, okay?

04:45.137 --> 04:48.310
The top line is, it's just--
it's, it's too long.

04:48.379 --> 04:50.689
Really? It didn't
feel too long to me.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.275
As a matter of fact,
I think there's stuff

04:52.344 --> 04:53.344
that should go back
in there.

04:53.413 --> 04:54.862
Yeah, yeah, that's cool.

04:54.931 --> 04:57.482
Listen, there's always,
you know, room for some trims.

04:57.551 --> 04:59.517
Yeah, no, we're gonna
need to make cuts.

04:59.586 --> 05:01.310
What kind of cuts?

05:01.379 --> 05:04.724
Well, it's, um,
it's 64 pages now.

05:04.793 --> 05:09.034
And, uh, my guess is...
30 pages need to go.

05:10.448 --> 05:11.655
Wait a minute,
hang on a second.

05:11.724 --> 05:12.793
You, you know this
is an hour-long drama.

05:12.862 --> 05:15.655
Yeah, well, Eric,
he was...

05:15.724 --> 05:18.000
He was very clear on this.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.448
He needs a half hour.

05:20.482 --> 05:21.827
[whispering]
He needs more jokes.

05:21.896 --> 05:23.000
Oh, and more jokes.

05:23.068 --> 05:25.551
Yeah, three, three
per page would be great.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.827
Then why did we have
this damn table read?

05:29.896 --> 05:31.034
To hear it.

05:31.103 --> 05:32.379
And we like
what we heard.

05:32.448 --> 05:34.517
Yeah, did, did Eric like
what he didn't hear?

05:34.586 --> 05:36.034
What's next?
Like, a laugh track?

05:36.103 --> 05:38.172
Maybe bring an audience in.
I'll do some warm-up.

05:38.241 --> 05:39.689
I don't think that's
what they're saying.

05:39.758 --> 05:40.758
Is that what
you're saying?

05:40.827 --> 05:42.551
Absolutely not.
No, George,

05:42.620 --> 05:45.103
we're not looking for some
hacky multi-cam sitcom.

05:45.172 --> 05:47.862
No, Eric just needs
a half hour for scheduling.

05:47.931 --> 05:50.310
Audience's attention spans
are shrinking.

05:50.379 --> 05:51.827
Especially with millennials.

05:51.896 --> 05:54.379
And half-hour dramas
really are the new thing.

05:54.448 --> 05:56.655
Exactly,
with comedic elements.

05:56.724 --> 05:59.724
Just like real life, right?
I mean, George, I get it.

05:59.793 --> 06:02.206
Sometimes comedians are
just so desperate

06:02.275 --> 06:03.724
to prove
that they have depth

06:03.793 --> 06:06.482
that they make everything
too serious, too grim.

06:06.551 --> 06:09.068
In life, well,
it's not like that.

06:09.137 --> 06:11.103
All right, well, I was gonna
make an ex-wife joke,

06:11.172 --> 06:13.241
but the lawyer told me
those were off the table.

06:13.310 --> 06:14.965
[both laughing]There you go.

06:15.034 --> 06:16.655
Here's the thing,
I don't care about
the running time.

06:16.724 --> 06:18.379
I care about the content.

06:18.448 --> 06:22.379
Yeah, and a, and an hour long
really is just two half hours.

06:22.448 --> 06:26.034
Right, which was
Eric's point all along.

06:31.241 --> 06:32.758
[distant phone ringing]

06:32.827 --> 06:34.413
Hey, Rachel,
great to see you.

06:34.482 --> 06:36.965
I heard you were tied up at set
and therefore unreachable.

06:37.034 --> 06:38.310
But I reached ya.

06:38.379 --> 06:39.517
It got canceled.

06:39.586 --> 06:41.103
I was just about
to call you.

06:41.172 --> 06:42.862
Look, what the hell is
going on with "Valleys"?

06:42.931 --> 06:44.413
The pilot got picked up,
congrats.

06:44.482 --> 06:46.586
Hey! You know what
I'm talking about.

06:46.655 --> 06:48.137
You know what's going on.

06:48.206 --> 06:50.482
Jason got fired.
I'm hanging on by a thread.

06:50.551 --> 06:52.620
If "Valleys" gets made,
I may keep my job.

06:52.689 --> 06:54.310
If it falls apart,
Greg will bounce me

06:54.379 --> 06:56.793
like you did Pfeiffer.
How is she?

06:56.862 --> 06:58.551
Hello! I don't give
a shit about Pfeiffer

06:58.620 --> 07:00.172
and neither should you.

07:00.241 --> 07:02.448
Is "Valleys" going to be turned
into some stupid sitcom?

07:02.517 --> 07:03.965
I need to protect
the project.

07:04.034 --> 07:05.689
And I need
to protect George.

07:05.758 --> 07:08.586
If you wanna do that, then
make sure this show happens.

07:08.655 --> 07:10.827
This could be a big win
for all of us.

07:10.896 --> 07:12.379
My new boss
loves the project.

07:12.448 --> 07:13.620
He thinks it could
be hilarious.

07:13.689 --> 07:15.137
The next "Two and a Half Men."

07:15.206 --> 07:17.517
Privately he calls it
"One and a Half Men."

07:17.586 --> 07:19.620
Sorry, that is so offensive.

07:19.689 --> 07:20.862
That show will get made.

07:20.931 --> 07:22.689
"Valleys" will never
get made.

07:22.758 --> 07:25.034
You wanna protect George?
Get him on board!

07:25.103 --> 07:27.758
By helping him destroy
the thing he cares about most?

07:27.827 --> 07:31.275
Or help make it be the best
possible sitcom it can still be.

07:31.344 --> 07:34.068
Everyone knows George walked out
on his deal in Vegas.

07:34.137 --> 07:36.413
He walks out
on a major network show,

07:36.482 --> 07:39.103
and he will never
work again.

07:43.586 --> 07:44.758
[Lori]
Is something wrong?

07:44.827 --> 07:47.620
Uh, you know, they're
shooting my pilot.

07:47.689 --> 07:49.137
I guess
that's not good news?

07:49.206 --> 07:51.137
I just wanna make sure
that the tone is right

07:51.206 --> 07:53.517
and that the network
and I see eye-to-eye on...

07:53.586 --> 07:55.275
That sounds stressful.

07:55.344 --> 07:57.103
You know
what you need?

07:57.172 --> 07:58.620
What's that?

07:58.689 --> 08:00.620
You need
to screw me... now.

08:00.689 --> 08:02.241
I'm sorry?You heard me.

08:02.310 --> 08:03.758
We've got 20 good minutes.

08:03.827 --> 08:05.448
And, I mean,
I'm stressed out myself,

08:05.517 --> 08:06.827
and I could use
a good screwing.

08:06.896 --> 08:08.793
Come on, my office
is soundproof.

08:08.862 --> 08:11.034

like a little baby.

08:13.103 --> 08:14.103
Uh...

[Lori]
Don't keep me waiting.

08:18.793 --> 08:20.689
You can unfollow me, Chandra.

08:20.758 --> 08:22.034
You can unfriend me,

08:22.103 --> 08:24.586
but you can't forget
about me, okay?

[knocking on door]

08:27.965 --> 08:30.758
Hello, brother, may we
see Hector and Manolo?

08:30.827 --> 08:32.137
They ain't here.

08:32.206 --> 08:34.241
Do you have my weed
and my pills?

08:34.310 --> 08:37.310
You all right, brother?
You look lost.

08:37.379 --> 08:38.724
I've had a recent setback.

08:38.793 --> 08:41.931
Financial? Health issues?
A woman?

08:42.000 --> 08:45.344
Yes! A woman,
how did you know?

08:45.413 --> 08:46.896
She left you.Yes.

08:46.965 --> 08:48.827
Well, here is a love
that will never leave you

08:48.896 --> 08:50.379
that you can always
count on.

08:50.448 --> 08:52.172
You're gonna say
Jesus, right?

08:52.241 --> 08:53.413
Follow us, brother.

08:53.482 --> 08:55.000
Throw your past behind you

08:55.068 --> 08:58.448
and follow Him into the light
of peace and love.

08:58.517 --> 09:00.172
What have you got to lose?

09:00.241 --> 09:02.896
Not much, I've lost
everything else.

09:05.551 --> 09:07.724
You should probably leave
the tequila, you know,

09:07.793 --> 09:09.517
for the righteousness
and stuff.

09:09.586 --> 09:13.068
Oh, yeah, but let's just do
one for the road, right?

09:18.965 --> 09:20.931
[Manolo]
You wanna take another break?

09:21.000 --> 09:23.172
No, that last break
was a mistake.

09:23.241 --> 09:25.862
But Wendy, I don't think we have
to worry about being found out.

09:25.931 --> 09:27.758
The test is tomorrow.

09:27.827 --> 09:28.965
Are you worried
I'm gonna fail?

09:29.034 --> 09:31.068
Oh, no, you're gonna pass.

09:31.137 --> 09:33.000
And that's what
I'm worried about.

09:33.068 --> 09:35.448
And then when you do, what
good will I be to you then?

09:35.517 --> 09:36.655
You don't have to worry.

09:36.724 --> 09:37.793
I watched
"Officer and a Gentleman."

09:37.862 --> 09:38.862
I won't leave you behind.

09:38.931 --> 09:40.724
Oh, baby, oh!

09:40.793 --> 09:42.000
Mmm...

09:43.137 --> 09:44.620
[doorbell rings,
knocking on door]

09:44.689 --> 09:46.620
All right.

09:46.689 --> 09:48.103
[knocking continues]

09:54.137 --> 09:55.172
Good idea.

09:56.413 --> 09:57.655
Okay.

10:00.172 --> 10:01.241
Whoa.

10:02.689 --> 10:04.103
All right, how did it go
at the network?

10:04.172 --> 10:05.551
Are we celebrating
or drowning our sorrows?

10:05.620 --> 10:06.620
'Cause I'm good at both.

10:06.689 --> 10:08.034
Okay, here's the deal.

10:08.103 --> 10:10.482
"Valleys," as an hour-long,
is dead.

10:10.551 --> 10:11.655
No way around it.

10:11.724 --> 10:13.241
But they love the project.

10:13.310 --> 10:16.482
They say it's still gonna be
gritty, just a little lighter.

10:16.551 --> 10:18.689
They see it
as a prestige project.

10:18.758 --> 10:20.034
How do you feel about that?

10:20.103 --> 10:22.068
I feel good.

10:22.137 --> 10:24.068
We just need to work
with the network,

10:24.137 --> 10:26.103
massage it a little bit
to get what we want.

10:26.172 --> 10:28.586
George, we can
protect the show.

10:28.655 --> 10:31.172
And I'm gonna protect you.

10:31.241 --> 10:33.275
Well, then I guess
we're celebrating!

10:33.344 --> 10:35.172
Okay.

10:35.241 --> 10:37.241
Come on, lift it up.

10:37.310 --> 10:38.379
Mmm.

10:44.793 --> 10:46.241
We're showing 'em all.

10:46.310 --> 10:47.586
Huh?!

10:47.655 --> 10:49.793
Let's drink to that.

10:51.724 --> 10:53.793
At least the Dodgers won.

10:53.862 --> 10:56.034
Hey, hey, hey,
Hector, Manolo, come on, man.

10:56.103 --> 10:58.000
Let's have a drink, we're
celebrating the new show.

10:58.068 --> 10:59.724
So "Valleys" gonna
be an hour?

10:59.793 --> 11:02.275
No, it's a half hour, but it,
but it, but it's a drama.

11:02.344 --> 11:03.965
You know, kind of like
a cool cable show

11:04.034 --> 11:05.655
or like an Internet-based...

11:05.724 --> 11:08.103
That sounds right.Yeah...

11:08.172 --> 11:09.620
business is different now.

11:09.689 --> 11:11.793
Nobody knows what they want.
It's not cut and dry.

11:11.862 --> 11:13.310
There's gray areas.

11:13.379 --> 11:15.137
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but
enough about Hollywood.

11:15.206 --> 11:16.655
You two, sit down,
grab a beer.

11:16.724 --> 11:18.586
Tell us about your day,
tell us about your day.

11:18.655 --> 11:19.827
Thanks, but I can't
be drinking.

11:19.896 --> 11:21.172
Tomorrow's my final.

11:21.241 --> 11:22.931
Oh, not me, I'm recording
another video

11:23.000 --> 11:24.206
for the Ab Jacker.

11:24.275 --> 11:25.758
[Olly]
Yeah, let's talk about that.

11:25.827 --> 11:27.689
Oh, is that one
of Lori's products?

11:27.758 --> 11:29.034
Nope, you were right.

11:29.103 --> 11:30.896
I can only sell
what I believe in

11:30.965 --> 11:32.379
and...
I believe in these.Ooh.

11:32.448 --> 11:34.551
Every day I post
a new exercise routine.

11:34.620 --> 11:36.413
And when it hits
and goes viral, I'm gonna--

11:36.482 --> 11:39.103
Hey, wait a minute, wait, wait,
talk to Marsupial about this.

11:39.172 --> 11:40.793
You just can have
something go viral.

11:40.862 --> 11:42.000
I already got
a million followers.

11:43.310 --> 11:45.172
And I already got
a great slogan.

11:46.965 --> 11:48.413
With the Ab Jacker,

11:48.482 --> 11:51.655
you can jack your way
to health and fitness.

11:51.724 --> 11:53.793
Oh...I'm in.

11:53.862 --> 11:55.758
Okay, uh, but don't
move your hands

11:55.827 --> 11:56.965
like that
when you say that.

11:57.034 --> 11:58.241
No, there'll be
a machine here.

11:58.310 --> 11:59.206
Oh.Yeah.

11:59.275 --> 12:00.827
Hey, speaking
about Marsupial,

12:00.896 --> 12:02.137
has anybody heard
from him?

12:02.206 --> 12:03.896
He's not
returning my texts.

12:03.965 --> 12:05.448
My textsss...

12:05.517 --> 12:06.620
My text messages.

12:06.689 --> 12:08.137
Text messages.

12:08.206 --> 12:09.724
He and I found
this great apartment

12:09.793 --> 12:10.827
for him and Chandra.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.551
And I want it.

12:12.620 --> 12:14.793
Yikes... cold.Oh.

12:14.862 --> 12:17.862
What? No, he probably doesn't
want it anymore, right?

12:17.931 --> 12:20.103
And everyone agrees I need
to get out of my mom's house.

12:20.172 --> 12:24.517
[laughs]Mmm... can you do
the thing again?

12:24.586 --> 12:25.724
Oh, this?

12:25.793 --> 12:27.448
No, the other thing.Oh.

12:27.517 --> 12:30.000
♪♪

12:30.068 --> 12:33.896
So... I'm thinking
we shoot San Fernando,

12:33.965 --> 12:35.413
run and gun,
keep it real.

12:35.482 --> 12:38.931
Real, for sure, real,
but not too real.Uh-huh.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.413
'Cause you know how when
you photograph food,

12:40.482 --> 12:42.965
it just looks terrible
until you gloss it up.

12:43.034 --> 12:46.965
I see orange and aqua
and mustard yellow.

12:47.034 --> 12:48.482
[George laughs]

12:48.551 --> 12:50.310
There's nothing wrong
with your eyesight, my man.

12:50.379 --> 12:52.724
But you do realize
this is for a chop shop

12:52.793 --> 12:54.586
and not a, a circus.

12:54.655 --> 12:56.448
And I don't think
you have any under there.

12:56.517 --> 12:58.551
But I'm thinking "Valleys" is
almost, like, black and white.

12:58.620 --> 13:01.379
Maybe we could use, you know,
like, that to start.

13:04.482 --> 13:06.931
Okay, well, but there's
a ton of colors

13:07.000 --> 13:09.413
in-between black and white
and what we have here.

13:09.482 --> 13:12.137
So maybe we just find
something in the middle.Yeah.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.758
There are other colors.

13:16.827 --> 13:18.137
I guess.

13:19.689 --> 13:21.689
Cool.
[clears throat]

13:21.758 --> 13:24.103
Well, great, thank you.Yeah.

13:24.172 --> 13:26.965
[George]
What just happened?

13:27.034 --> 13:28.689
Man, who hired that guy?

13:28.758 --> 13:30.689
The studio,
they love him.

13:30.758 --> 13:32.379
They swear by him.

13:32.448 --> 13:34.793
We just need to give him some
guidance which we just did.

13:34.862 --> 13:36.517
I don't know,
that dude...

13:36.586 --> 13:38.586
George, this is
the kind of push and pull

13:38.655 --> 13:39.862
we need to deal with

13:39.931 --> 13:41.275
if we're going
to get what we want.

13:41.344 --> 13:43.517
We just need to play
with the genre.

13:43.586 --> 13:44.965
Show a new angle.

13:45.034 --> 13:46.448
That's what's gonna
work for the network.

13:46.517 --> 13:49.931
And it's still gonna follow
your vision... in a new way.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.103
All right,
well, I guess so.

13:51.172 --> 13:52.655
But let's say on top
of him, okay?

13:52.724 --> 13:54.620
And if he blows that base smoke
in my face one more time,

13:54.689 --> 13:56.241
I'ma take that pen.

13:56.310 --> 13:57.931
He's gonna be blowing smoke out
of another part of his body.

13:58.000 --> 13:59.310
Well, lucky him.

13:59.379 --> 14:01.827
Oh, man, I gotta go home,
I'm meeting Lori.

14:01.896 --> 14:03.586
Oh, she's coming to you?

14:03.655 --> 14:05.137
That sounds promising.

14:05.206 --> 14:08.172
Yeah, you know, it's just, uh,
a lot of giving and taking.

14:08.241 --> 14:12.310
You know, healthy doses
of giving and taking.

14:12.379 --> 14:14.172
It's the call I've been
stalled out,

14:14.241 --> 14:16.068
but now they call it
giving and taking.

14:16.137 --> 14:17.931
Well, good meeting!

14:20.068 --> 14:21.862
I gotta say,
this is great.

14:21.931 --> 14:23.689
And very manly.

never set foot in here.

I've been waiting
for the... right woman.Hmm.

14:32.137 --> 14:33.482
So, Hector, huh?

14:33.551 --> 14:35.172
What's he doing?
Branching out on his own?

14:35.241 --> 14:36.482
Well, not exactly
on his own.

14:36.551 --> 14:38.344
You know, we are
thinking of building

14:38.413 --> 14:41.827
a whole social media
fitness platform around him.

14:41.896 --> 14:43.931
He's clearly an influencer.

14:44.965 --> 14:48.206
Quite a kid, but,
uh, you know...

14:48.275 --> 14:49.965
So are you,
I gotta tell ya.

14:50.034 --> 14:51.896
I never felt more comfortable
with somebody

14:51.965 --> 14:54.034
in such a short time,
I mean.

14:54.103 --> 14:56.000
Hey, you know what,
where are the guys?

14:56.068 --> 14:58.379
Oh, uh, let's see.

14:58.448 --> 15:00.068
Hector and Maronzio
are out.

15:00.137 --> 15:02.137
And Manolo's
taking his test.

15:02.206 --> 15:03.482
Oh, yeah?

15:05.137 --> 15:07.482
That is a very big counter.

15:07.551 --> 15:08.551
Hmm.

15:14.482 --> 15:16.275
I need to go to the bathroom.

15:16.344 --> 15:18.448
Uh, yeah, yeah, me too.

15:20.137 --> 15:22.862
Okay, go, you two go.

You're gonna need to leave
your cell phones here

15:25.241 --> 15:26.551
in the classroom, thank you.

15:26.620 --> 15:27.862
I told you
it wouldn't work.

15:27.931 --> 15:30.620
I still need to go pee.

15:30.689 --> 15:33.413
I removed the study guide
from the tampon dispenser.

get held back again.

15:44.137 --> 15:46.379
Pencils down.

15:49.310 --> 15:53.241
As Triumph Seekers,
we've broken the laws of man.

15:53.310 --> 15:55.275
And we've been imprisoned

15:55.344 --> 15:57.241
by following
the laws of God.

15:57.310 --> 15:59.034
We've redeemed ourselves.

15:59.103 --> 16:01.413
Mike was an arsonist.

16:01.482 --> 16:03.448
And Ironhead stabbed
his mom in the neck.

16:03.517 --> 16:06.931

as has the Lord.

Amen!

But there is a man among us
who's committed no crimes.

16:11.965 --> 16:13.517
But he has sinned.

16:13.586 --> 16:17.068
And to find salvation,
you must admit your sins.

16:17.137 --> 16:19.931
Can you do that,
Brother Maronzio?

16:20.000 --> 16:21.344
Yes.

16:21.413 --> 16:23.344
Hell, yeah, I sinned.

16:23.413 --> 16:25.551
All I did was sin.

16:25.620 --> 16:27.896
I sinned so much
I was proud of it!

16:27.965 --> 16:30.000
I was proud
of what I was doing!

16:30.068 --> 16:31.827
So proud I couldn't even see!

16:31.896 --> 16:35.172
I couldn't see that
I was losing the best thing

16:35.241 --> 16:37.620
that ever happened
to me until now.

16:37.689 --> 16:39.448
Until right now!

16:39.517 --> 16:41.448
I'm on the path
to righteousness.

16:41.517 --> 16:45.448
And nothing, I mean nothing
can stand in my way!

16:45.517 --> 16:47.068
We're here
for you, brother.

16:47.137 --> 16:50.344
I'm gonna wash away my sins
with the blood of Christ!

some strong coffee.

number one.

at the cabaret.

last night.

"Harvard Lampoon" writers

17:21.827 --> 17:23.137
to do a couple punch-ups.

17:23.206 --> 17:24.620
[clears throat]
Harvard, great.

17:24.689 --> 17:26.931
College kids are gonna
rewrite "Valleys."

17:27.000 --> 17:29.275
Well, they want to appeal
to millennials.

17:29.344 --> 17:30.965
Even though millennials
don't even watch TV.

17:31.034 --> 17:32.172
All right, that's stupid.

17:32.241 --> 17:35.275
That's... stupid,
it's ridiculous.

17:35.344 --> 17:37.310
That's... corny and stupid.

17:37.379 --> 17:39.275
You know what?
This is all stupid!

17:39.344 --> 17:41.413
Well, I was told to go
off the one-sheet

17:41.482 --> 17:42.827
for tone guidance, so...

17:42.896 --> 17:44.586
Oh, my God, this is--
This is ridiculous!

17:44.655 --> 17:46.965
And it's offensive,
all right?

17:47.034 --> 17:48.137
And you know what
else is offensive?!

17:48.206 --> 17:50.310
That sombrero right
there behind you.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.103
What's wrong
with the sombre--

17:55.482 --> 17:56.689
[Olly]
George!

17:56.758 --> 17:58.310
George! George!

17:58.379 --> 18:01.172
That poster was a mistake.

18:01.241 --> 18:02.448
But we can fix it.

18:02.517 --> 18:03.931
We just have to learn
to navigate things.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.068
I mean, look, maybe
the network does see things

18:06.137 --> 18:07.517
a little broader
than you and I do.

18:07.586 --> 18:10.206
We can make this work.
We just get big ratings.

18:10.275 --> 18:12.172
And then for season two,
we do it our way.

18:12.241 --> 18:14.137
No, that's not
how it works.

18:14.206 --> 18:16.862
How it works is season two,
you do it their way again

18:16.931 --> 18:18.655
because in season one,
you proved to them

18:18.724 --> 18:20.241
that they can push
you around.

18:20.310 --> 18:22.758
George, you can't just flip
over the checker board

18:22.827 --> 18:24.310
every time you don't
get what you want.

18:24.379 --> 18:25.517
That's the analogy
you use?

18:25.586 --> 18:27.793
You know what?
I can and I will.

18:27.862 --> 18:30.241
This is your chance.

18:30.310 --> 18:31.862
You think this is gonna
make me relevant?

18:31.931 --> 18:33.551
This is gonna
make me the punch line

18:33.620 --> 18:35.724
to a joke by someone
who is relevant.

18:35.793 --> 18:38.310
This is all you've got.

18:38.379 --> 18:40.310
I wish it was
different, but...

18:40.379 --> 18:43.482
you have to make this work
or you may never work again.

18:44.862 --> 18:49.137
[clears throat]
So, ah, wow, uh, that's...

18:49.206 --> 18:50.896
So you're protecting me now?

18:50.965 --> 18:52.793
I'm trying to.

18:52.862 --> 18:54.344
You know what, Olly?

18:54.413 --> 18:55.620
You're just like Danny.

18:55.689 --> 18:56.862
You're Danny.

18:56.931 --> 18:58.448
But instead of
sticking me in Vegas,

18:58.517 --> 18:59.965
you wanna stick me in some
shitty ass multi-cam.

19:00.034 --> 19:01.827
This isn't about me.
It's never been about me.

19:01.896 --> 19:03.827
This is about you
and your magency.

19:03.896 --> 19:06.103
And proving that you can
raise enough money

19:06.172 --> 19:08.620
and be successful enough to
move out of your mom's house.

19:08.689 --> 19:10.517
That's not fair.No kidding.

19:10.586 --> 19:12.862
You know what? I, I, I thought
you were different.

19:12.931 --> 19:14.379
I thought...

19:14.448 --> 19:16.586
I thought I could
count on you, you know?

19:16.655 --> 19:19.517
Yeah, I guess
I was wrong, huh?
