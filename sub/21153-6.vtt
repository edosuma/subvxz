WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:04.405
JAMIE: Ten years ago,
the animal population mutated,

00:04.438 --> 00:06.774
endangering human
life on the planet.

00:06.807 --> 00:09.077
Our team managed to
cure the animals,

00:09.110 --> 00:11.679
but at a terrible cost.

00:11.712 --> 00:14.648
In an attempt to return
the planet to the animals,

00:14.682 --> 00:17.218
a secretive group called
the Shepherds released a gas

00:17.251 --> 00:20.754
that sterilized all of humanity.

00:20.788 --> 00:23.091
And then,
lab-made creatures called "hybrids"

00:23.124 --> 00:24.358
devastated the West Coast,

00:24.392 --> 00:27.128
so a massive barrier
was constructed

00:27.161 --> 00:29.563
to protect the rest
of North America,

00:29.597 --> 00:32.566
but new breeds have
started to appear,

00:32.600 --> 00:34.435
so we reassembled our team.

00:34.468 --> 00:37.238
We battle on many fronts,

00:37.271 --> 00:39.440
searching for a
cure to sterility

00:39.473 --> 00:42.576
while racing to stop the
hybrids and a brutal terrorist,

00:42.610 --> 00:45.146
who is using them to
end the human race.

00:45.179 --> 00:50.251
The fight for mankind's
survival has just begun.

00:50.284 --> 00:51.385
Previously on Zoo...

00:51.419 --> 00:53.287
Dad? Mitch.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.691
MITCH: I'm sorry, he's dead.

00:57.725 --> 01:00.261
She's taking us to see
someone named Abendegos,

01:00.294 --> 01:01.438
who's been waiting
for Mr. Duncan.

01:01.462 --> 01:04.532
(roaring)

01:04.565 --> 01:06.700
Abigail! NYPD! Freeze!

01:08.769 --> 01:11.139
I can get Isaac back.
You want Isaac,

01:11.172 --> 01:12.606
you bring me Clementine Lewis.

01:12.640 --> 01:14.142
Deal is on. Perfect.

01:14.175 --> 01:16.277
By day's end,
you'll be holding your son again.

01:16.310 --> 01:18.846
We ran some tests on Clem's blood...
she's pregnant.

01:18.879 --> 01:21.482
Reiden found out about it,
and she's been abducted.

01:21.515 --> 01:24.218
I didn't kill Leanne.
She was dead when I found her.

01:24.252 --> 01:26.620
It's a boy. Tell The Gentlemen

01:26.654 --> 01:29.190
that bidding will
begin at $80 million.

01:30.191 --> 01:32.226
(razorbacks snarling)

01:34.428 --> 01:37.465
ABIGAIL (weakly): Jackson...

01:37.498 --> 01:40.568
Jackson...

01:40.601 --> 01:42.436
He chose Jackson.

01:44.438 --> 01:46.640
Thank you.

01:56.750 --> 01:58.519
Oh... Oh, she's alive.

01:58.552 --> 02:00.554
Barely.

02:00.588 --> 02:02.823
Make sure to bring
the razorbacks inside.

02:02.856 --> 02:04.858
MAN: Yes, ma'am.

02:13.734 --> 02:18.239
The bidding will
begin at $80 million.

02:25.646 --> 02:27.181
AUCTIONEER: We have confirmation

02:27.215 --> 02:31.352
she is carrying a
viable male fetus.

02:33.787 --> 02:37.157
$80 million to the gentleman
from the Russian Federation.

02:39.393 --> 02:41.895
Do I have anyone with 90?

02:41.929 --> 02:44.232
Very good. 90 to the gentleman

02:44.265 --> 02:46.634
from the United Arab Emirates.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.502
Who do I have at 100?

02:48.536 --> 02:51.672
A more-than-fair price for
the first pregnant woman

02:51.705 --> 02:53.374
in a decade.

03:24.405 --> 03:26.307
(grunts, gags)

03:34.582 --> 03:36.584
(animals snorting, growling)

03:40.621 --> 03:42.323
(man speaks foreign language)

03:42.356 --> 03:44.958
TESSA: Jackson,
if that clicker didn't do this,

03:44.992 --> 03:47.695
does that mean you summoned
these animals with your mind?

03:47.728 --> 03:48.996
Sorta.

03:49.029 --> 03:50.898
Jackson! You really want to play

03:50.931 --> 03:52.300
20 Questions right now?

03:54.535 --> 03:56.470
No!

03:56.504 --> 03:58.406
(shouting)

03:58.439 --> 03:59.439
(gunfire)

04:03.311 --> 04:04.321
What are you doing back here?

04:04.345 --> 04:05.979
Hey, uh, yeah, sorry.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.715
I'm late.
They made me park in the garage.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.817
No valet... can you believe that?
Anyway...

04:12.886 --> 04:13.854
(lock beeps)

04:13.887 --> 04:15.956
Dad?

04:19.091 --> 04:20.461
Hey. (door rattling)

04:20.494 --> 04:21.695
Hey.

04:21.728 --> 04:24.565
(gunfire)

04:24.598 --> 04:26.967
Okay, look, we can't leave
here without the hybrid, okay?

04:27.000 --> 04:29.470
We got to get to the truck,
hook it to the trailer,

04:29.503 --> 04:31.939
and get the hell out of here.
Okay, on the count of three,

04:31.972 --> 04:33.474
make a run for it. Perfect.

04:33.507 --> 04:34.642
Three! Tessa!

04:47.655 --> 04:49.790
(roaring, growling)

04:54.895 --> 04:56.597
(gunfire)

04:56.630 --> 04:58.475
I am under the distinct
impression that this is not

04:58.499 --> 04:59.779
a normal hospital.
(loud banging)

05:00.668 --> 05:02.970
Remain calm,
everything is under control.

05:05.806 --> 05:06.774
Earmuffs.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.842
What?

05:11.879 --> 05:13.681
(screaming)

05:15.148 --> 05:18.752
Um... come on.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.990
(gunfire)

05:23.023 --> 05:24.992
(engine starts)

05:25.025 --> 05:26.727
(gunfire)

05:36.737 --> 05:38.457
Back up, back up, back
up, back up, back up.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.877
Back up, back up! That's good.

05:48.616 --> 05:50.651
(gunfire)

05:55.055 --> 05:57.691
(growling)

05:57.725 --> 05:59.960
(screaming)

05:59.993 --> 06:02.796
Did you do that? No.

06:02.830 --> 06:04.465
Maybe. I don't know.
Come on, let's go.

06:10.203 --> 06:13.006
(gunfire)

06:18.946 --> 06:20.548
(gunfire continues)

06:25.719 --> 06:26.820
That went well.

06:30.458 --> 06:33.961
So you're pregnant, huh?
That's cool.

06:33.994 --> 06:36.697
This is so not how I
wanted you to find out.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.032
(lock beeps)

06:41.702 --> 06:42.970
Freeze!

06:43.003 --> 06:44.838
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

06:44.872 --> 06:45.873
Don't hurt her!

06:52.713 --> 06:55.816
Drop your weapon.

07:06.927 --> 07:08.529
Clem...

07:08.562 --> 07:11.431
Let us go,
or I kill humanity's last hope.

07:14.234 --> 07:16.436
♪

07:32.553 --> 07:33.954
Put your guns down.

07:38.592 --> 07:40.828
Guns down now!

07:49.703 --> 07:52.072
Okay.

07:52.105 --> 07:54.742
Guess we'll be going now.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.611
AUCTIONEER: Word is out.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.981
It doesn't matter where you go,

08:01.014 --> 08:03.551
you won't be able
to protect her.

08:07.254 --> 08:08.956
(cries out)

08:08.989 --> 08:10.891
Well,
he's right about one thing...

08:10.924 --> 08:13.193
You are now the most
important person in the world.

08:13.226 --> 08:14.862
Let's go find out why.

08:18.866 --> 08:20.934
LOGAN: You know, most people,

08:20.968 --> 08:22.078
they just worry about
running into their ex

08:22.102 --> 08:23.704
at the grocery store,

08:23.737 --> 08:25.072
not arresting them for murder.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.540
I told you,
I didn't kill Leanne.

08:26.574 --> 08:28.942
And, against my better judgment,

08:28.976 --> 08:30.744
I'm starting to believe you.

08:30.778 --> 08:31.912
But you've been arrested.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.179
There's no take-backs.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.683
That is an ocular-chip lens.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.852
It has a whole lot more on
it than decryption power.

08:38.885 --> 08:40.921
Leanne was wearing it
when she was murdered.

08:40.953 --> 08:42.956
It will tell us who killed her.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.967
It'd be a little
easier without these.

09:12.252 --> 09:14.254
MAN: Take her down to 2.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.591
We need to assemble a team.

09:17.625 --> 09:19.893
Everything's on hold
until we can get you well.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.361
You're not listening to me.

09:21.394 --> 09:23.096
I want Jackson Oz.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.765
This is not some
personal vendetta.

09:24.798 --> 09:26.266
He's not part of the plan.

09:26.299 --> 09:28.035
He's part of mine.

09:29.336 --> 09:31.271
Quick,
get her to the stasis tank.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.907
MAN: Yes, sir.

09:33.941 --> 09:35.643
FEMALE NEWSCASTER:
We're less than 48 hours

09:35.676 --> 09:37.745
from the launch of the TX-gas,

09:37.778 --> 09:40.914
which the Noah Objective
promises will safely eliminate

09:40.948 --> 09:42.382
the mutated animals.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.818
Don't believe everything
you hear on the news.

09:45.953 --> 09:48.789
TAD: Abigail.

09:48.822 --> 09:50.323
Something you need to see.

09:55.228 --> 09:57.665
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:57.698 --> 09:59.399
Blue Diaspora.

09:59.432 --> 10:02.202
You can't work on
this out in the open.

10:02.235 --> 10:03.937
I can do what I like.

10:03.971 --> 10:06.740
The council forbade you from
continuing your father's work.

10:06.774 --> 10:08.141
Hybrids are too dangerous.

10:08.175 --> 10:11.211
The animals are
still susceptible

10:11.244 --> 10:12.345
to the Mother Cell.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.181
The mutation will rise again,

10:14.214 --> 10:16.016
stronger and immune to any cure

10:16.049 --> 10:18.351
humankind can come up with.

10:18.385 --> 10:19.963
Mass extinction of the
entire animal kingdom

10:19.987 --> 10:21.755
is sure to follow.

10:21.789 --> 10:23.991
Well, your father's
not gonna approve.

10:25.993 --> 10:28.195
Well, he's not here.

10:28.228 --> 10:30.097
Actually...

10:30.130 --> 10:31.231
he is.

10:31.264 --> 10:33.266
Arrived an hour ago.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.938
Who's that next to your father?

10:40.007 --> 10:41.775
My brother.

10:41.809 --> 10:44.712
The useless,
drunken safari-guide brother?

10:44.745 --> 10:47.414
What's he doing here?

10:49.082 --> 10:52.385
I have no idea.

10:52.419 --> 10:55.122
(Abendegos roaring) He's chained,
shouldn't be able to get free.

10:56.289 --> 10:59.392
(growling)

10:59.426 --> 11:02.129
How does this thing fit
in your sister's plan?

11:02.162 --> 11:05.298
"Plan." She has a plan beyond
just unleashing pain and terror?

11:05.332 --> 11:07.210
The people holding him were
waiting for a Mr. Duncan.

11:07.234 --> 11:11.004
We think he might be Abigail's
partner in this, somehow.

11:11.038 --> 11:12.372
(growling stops)

11:15.776 --> 11:17.244
What happened?

11:24.451 --> 11:26.453
(shouting)

11:26.486 --> 11:29.322
So definitely not
chained anymore.

11:30.257 --> 11:32.926
I need to study this Abendegos.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.480
Do you have any
tranquilizers on board?

11:36.129 --> 11:38.365
Like, dinosaur tranquilizers?

11:38.398 --> 11:40.300
Oh, yeah.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.935
I'll go prepare a sedative.

11:41.969 --> 11:44.738
(growling continues)

11:47.340 --> 11:49.309
Why didn't you tell me?

11:49.342 --> 11:52.179
You have a lot going on.

11:52.212 --> 11:56.449
Clem, you're the only pregnant
woman in the entire world.

11:56.483 --> 11:58.218
And you have a bio-drive

11:58.251 --> 12:00.520
surgically implanted
in your brain.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.390
We all have our issues.

12:03.423 --> 12:06.093
It's got to have something
to do to your background.

12:06.126 --> 12:09.096
Your Glazier's disease
and the ghost gene

12:09.129 --> 12:13.000
maybe had a contraindication
with the cure serum.

12:13.033 --> 12:16.169
Maybe, uh,
negated the effects of the TX-gas.

12:16.203 --> 12:18.138
Okay. I need you to stop

12:18.171 --> 12:21.508
acting like a scientist and
start acting like a grandfather.

12:21.541 --> 12:25.078
Oh, hey, nope. You don't get
to use that word ever again.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.413
You can't deny it.

12:26.446 --> 12:28.782
This is happening.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.117
Yeah.

12:30.150 --> 12:32.820
I'm trying to figure out why.

12:32.853 --> 12:37.490
So we can come up with
patriarchal nicknames later.

12:37.524 --> 12:39.827
Like way later.

12:39.860 --> 12:43.263
We've got a long
road ahead of us.

12:43.296 --> 12:46.066
The team is heading
back to pick us up.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.473
We need to dissolve
this into a solution

12:53.506 --> 12:56.143
and then we should be ready to
sedate your friend Abendegos.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.444
Great.

12:59.980 --> 13:01.815
Abe, how are you holding up

13:01.849 --> 13:03.383
with Isaac and everything?

13:03.416 --> 13:05.819
Not well.

13:05.853 --> 13:08.555
But I've gotten good
at distracting myself.

13:08.588 --> 13:11.124
Keeping myself busy.

13:11.158 --> 13:13.260
You know,
before they took Isaac away,

13:13.293 --> 13:16.830
I was working on a synthetic
reproductive hormone,

13:16.864 --> 13:19.099
based on the NLRP2 protein

13:19.132 --> 13:22.335
and stem cells harvested from
animal cerebrospinal fluid.

13:24.037 --> 13:26.106
Animal stem cells.

13:26.139 --> 13:29.309
That makes sense; they weren't
affected by the TX-gas.

13:29.342 --> 13:32.179
Exactly, but none of the
animal samples I tested

13:32.212 --> 13:34.114
yielded any positive results.

13:34.147 --> 13:37.885
But these hybrids are different.

13:37.918 --> 13:40.420
They display a
hypergrowth property.

13:40.453 --> 13:43.423
I believe their stem
cells could be the key.

13:43.456 --> 13:45.859
So, Clem and her being pregnant,

13:45.893 --> 13:47.560
how does that factor
into all of this?

13:47.594 --> 13:49.562
The child has a unique protein.

13:49.596 --> 13:52.532
(chuckles) Unlike
anything I've ever seen.

13:52.565 --> 13:57.304
It displays even greater
potential than the NLRP2 protein

13:57.337 --> 14:00.307
at synthesizing the reproductive
hormone that we need.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.110
I'm going to call
it the CLM-protein.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.477
After Clementine.

14:04.511 --> 14:07.114
(chuckles) All right,
so Clem's baby,

14:07.147 --> 14:09.649
plus hybrid stem cells,

14:09.682 --> 14:13.553
could solve the
sterility problem?

14:13.586 --> 14:15.622
That's the idea, at least.

14:15.655 --> 14:17.590
(growling)

14:17.624 --> 14:20.493
We just need a cerebrospinal
fluid sample from Abendegos

14:20.527 --> 14:21.895
to prove it.

14:22.695 --> 14:25.265
How hard could that be?

14:25.298 --> 14:28.568
Well, here we go.

14:40.147 --> 14:41.514
(sizzling)

14:41.548 --> 14:43.350
What is that?

14:43.383 --> 14:45.352
A security measure.

14:53.026 --> 14:55.295
Oh, okay. Got it.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.070
Well, let's see who
killed Leanne Ducovny.

15:02.469 --> 15:05.338
So, how do you do it?

15:05.372 --> 15:07.207
Control the animals.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.243
The lions in Portland,
that Noah's Ark back there?

15:12.279 --> 15:14.281
My father.

15:16.549 --> 15:21.421
He did genetic experiments
on me when I was a kid.

15:23.423 --> 15:28.261
And I think the gas
that sterilized people

15:28.295 --> 15:30.630
activated something in me.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.165
You must hate him.

15:34.101 --> 15:35.368
Yeah.

15:35.402 --> 15:36.970
And no.

15:37.004 --> 15:40.073
Part of me thinks that
he couldn't help it.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.109
Between him and my sister,

15:42.142 --> 15:45.512
I'm beginning to think that
there's something tainted

15:45.545 --> 15:47.680
in the Oz bloodline.

15:47.714 --> 15:50.417
Like, we're cursed.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.585
Jackson,
you can't really believe that.

15:55.655 --> 15:57.024
ABRAHAM (over
intercom): Jackson.

15:57.057 --> 16:00.693
We're ready in the vehicle bay.

16:00.727 --> 16:04.064
When we land,

16:04.097 --> 16:08.968
I think that you should get as
far away from me as possible.

16:24.517 --> 16:27.220
Hope you boys cooked
up a good plan.

16:27.254 --> 16:28.755
If we don't put
this guy down ASAP,

16:28.788 --> 16:30.599
it's gonna give turbulence
a whole new meaning.

16:30.623 --> 16:32.792
Remember.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.327
Straight to the heart.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.363
Straight to the what?

16:36.396 --> 16:40.200
How are you gonna get close
enough to stab it in the heart?

16:40.233 --> 16:42.202
I'm gonna give
him what he wants.

16:42.235 --> 16:43.403
Me.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.747
(growling)

16:54.781 --> 16:55.782
Be careful, rafiki.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.720
Don't shoot unless I say so.

17:08.761 --> 17:10.130
Ready.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.165
(growling)

17:38.258 --> 17:39.292
Don't shoot.

17:43.696 --> 17:44.531
(roars)

17:44.564 --> 17:45.832
(all screaming)

17:47.834 --> 17:49.869
(Jackson grunts)

17:49.902 --> 17:51.638
Little help here?!

17:54.207 --> 17:55.375
(chuckles)

17:55.408 --> 17:57.544
(sighs)

17:57.577 --> 17:58.711
(Abraham exhales)

18:00.413 --> 18:02.382
Okay, Leanne's in her office.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.751
Let's find out who killed her.

18:04.784 --> 18:08.155
If this turns out to be you,
I'm gonna be very disappointed.

18:15.928 --> 18:18.498
(door opens)

18:18.531 --> 18:20.267
(door closes)

18:23.803 --> 18:25.472
It's over, Leanne.

18:25.505 --> 18:26.915
LEANNE: Robert would
roll over in his grave

18:26.939 --> 18:28.508
if he knew what you'd become.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.510
My father made me what I am.

18:30.543 --> 18:33.613
LEANNE: You're never
gonna get away with this.

18:33.646 --> 18:35.748
I already have.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.784
We have the Melvatox-B.

18:39.819 --> 18:42.322
We don't need you anymore.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.496
Abigail.

18:49.529 --> 18:52.399
They were connected?
How did I miss that?

18:52.432 --> 18:55.502
You notice how Abigail
said "we" in the recording?

18:55.535 --> 18:57.804
"We have the Melvatox-B."

18:57.837 --> 18:59.939
Yeah.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.941
She must be working
with a partner.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.443
We need to find Abigail.

19:04.777 --> 19:06.613
Or her partner.

19:06.646 --> 19:09.416
Well, it would be easier if one
of us weren't in police custody.

19:09.449 --> 19:13.553
I'll talk to the captain,
tell him we have a new suspect.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.588
Abigail Westbrook.

19:24.864 --> 19:27.334
There's only so much
the tank can do.

19:27.367 --> 19:29.502
A lot is up to her.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.504
She'll survive.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.706
Her work isn't finished yet.

19:37.577 --> 19:38.611
ROBERT: Hi, angel.

19:40.647 --> 19:42.282
Dad, you're back.

19:42.315 --> 19:43.450
Hi.

19:43.483 --> 19:44.884
What happened to your face?

19:44.917 --> 19:47.587
Oh, it's just an accident.

19:47.620 --> 19:52.225
So, I finished with General
Davies and the TX-gas.

19:52.259 --> 19:53.726
We're ready to launch.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.995
That's great.

19:56.028 --> 20:00.267
Um, I saw that you
brought Jackson

20:00.300 --> 20:03.303
and the rest of his team here.

20:03.336 --> 20:05.405
Why?

20:05.438 --> 20:07.240
Wasn't part of the plan.

20:07.274 --> 20:09.442
I know.

20:09.476 --> 20:11.744
Here's the thing about Jackson.

20:11.778 --> 20:14.647
He's a useless piece of flesh
who's squandering the Oz name?

20:15.815 --> 20:18.718
Or, sorry,
is it "dishonors the Oz name"?

20:18.751 --> 20:23.256
Jackson's grown up a
lot in the last year.

20:24.457 --> 20:26.559
Okay, so...

20:26.593 --> 20:28.728
what, you suddenly trust him?

20:30.463 --> 20:31.674
Are you gonna tell him the plan?

20:31.698 --> 20:32.978
Is that why you
brought him home?

20:34.534 --> 20:37.670
I brought him home
because he's sick.

20:37.704 --> 20:39.005
Very sick.

20:39.038 --> 20:41.641
But Dr. Morgan

20:41.674 --> 20:44.677
has found a way to cure
Jackson and the animals.

20:44.711 --> 20:47.780
So Mitch Morgan is as
brilliant as we believed.

20:47.814 --> 20:50.483
Yeah, and then some.

20:50.517 --> 20:54.687
He might even be
a match for you.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.756
Do you think he could
crack Blue Diaspora?

20:59.492 --> 21:02.028
Why are you asking
about Blue Diaspora?

21:23.850 --> 21:26.519
(grumbles)

21:30.857 --> 21:33.393
You were told not to do this.

21:33.426 --> 21:37.564
Problem with the hybrids is
they were uncontrollable.

21:37.597 --> 21:39.699
Like feral animals.

21:39.732 --> 21:42.835
But I fixed it.

21:42.869 --> 21:44.871
You used human DNA.

21:46.706 --> 21:49.909
Your DNA? Abigail.

21:49.942 --> 21:52.445
I thought you'd be happy.

21:53.813 --> 21:56.048
This was your project.

21:56.082 --> 21:58.818
And I fixed it for you.

22:04.023 --> 22:07.994
We invested everything
in formulating the TX-gas

22:08.027 --> 22:10.129
and reversing the
animal mutation.

22:10.162 --> 22:12.465
But that is only
a temporary solve.

22:12.499 --> 22:14.033
This is the real solve.

22:18.037 --> 22:20.507
I'm calling him Abendegos.

22:23.643 --> 22:26.045
(coos)

22:26.078 --> 22:29.582
Really is something.

22:34.120 --> 22:37.089
I have to get back to Jackson.

22:37.123 --> 22:39.559
We'll talk about
this more later.

22:39.592 --> 22:41.027
Do you want my help?

22:41.060 --> 22:42.829
He's my brother, after all.

22:42.862 --> 22:44.497
Maybe I should finally meet him.

22:44.531 --> 22:47.500
No, I have all the help
I need with Dr. Morgan.

22:47.534 --> 22:49.035
I'll be back.

22:49.068 --> 22:51.070
I promise.

22:53.005 --> 22:56.676
(cooing)

22:56.709 --> 22:58.711
NEWSWOMAN: Abigail Westbrook,

22:58.745 --> 23:01.180
the most wanted woman in the United
States, remains at large.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.750
The authorities warn, do...

23:03.783 --> 23:05.885
I just spoke to Jackson,

23:05.918 --> 23:07.796
told him about his baby
sister's latest homicide

23:07.820 --> 23:09.622
and the Melvatox-B.

23:09.656 --> 23:14.026
Jackson has a lead on someone
who might be Abigail's partner,

23:14.060 --> 23:15.662
somebody named Mr. Duncan.

23:15.695 --> 23:17.597
Charles Duncan?

23:17.630 --> 23:19.098
Maybe.

23:19.131 --> 23:20.767
Who's that?

23:20.800 --> 23:22.569
He's a ghost.

23:22.602 --> 23:25.838
He's public enemy number one
for the Shepherd hunters.

23:25.872 --> 23:27.983
There are rumors that he's
a bomb maker or a scientist,

23:28.007 --> 23:30.209
but nobody knows where he is
or even what he looks like.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.912
So, do you think this Mr. Duncan

23:32.945 --> 23:34.981
could be the "we"
Abigail was referring to?

23:35.014 --> 23:36.883
The one who helped
with the Melvatox-B?

23:36.916 --> 23:39.952
There's one way to find out.

23:44.757 --> 23:48.127
Yahtzee. Charles Duncan.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.862
He supervised the
transfer of assets

23:49.896 --> 23:51.531
when Reiden bought Melvatox.

23:51.564 --> 23:53.933
Took possession of 50,000
units of Melvatox-B.

23:53.966 --> 23:57.069
50,000?

23:57.103 --> 24:00.139
You're not gonna carry
that out the front door.

24:00.172 --> 24:01.708
Is there an address there?

24:01.741 --> 24:04.577
44 East 138th.

24:12.652 --> 24:14.754
Loading dock that
exits onto Park.

24:15.722 --> 24:17.624
Traffic cam at the
end of the alley.

24:17.657 --> 24:19.826
JAMIE: The transfer
of assets form

24:19.859 --> 24:23.730
is dated November 7, 3:14 p.m.

24:29.135 --> 24:31.604
I have something.

24:34.941 --> 24:36.275
JAMIE: It's too dark.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.610
I can't see his face.

24:37.644 --> 24:39.021
I have a program
that will clear it.

24:39.045 --> 24:40.589
Well, how long will it take?
It's hard to say,

24:40.613 --> 24:42.615
but if he's the ghost
that you describe,

24:42.649 --> 24:45.251
it'll be worth the wait.

24:45.284 --> 24:46.986
All right, Mr. Duncan,

24:47.019 --> 24:48.888
you've been the center
of all this suffering.

24:48.921 --> 24:50.690
Let's see who you really are.

24:53.159 --> 24:56.195
Jamie and Logan found
out who killed Leanne.

24:56.228 --> 24:58.731
It was Abigail.

24:58.765 --> 25:00.299
What?

25:00.332 --> 25:02.602
How is your sister connected
to the CEO of Reiden?

25:02.635 --> 25:05.037
It's starting to seem like
she's connected to everything.

25:05.071 --> 25:07.874
Come quick. It's the kids.

25:09.776 --> 25:11.978
They're raiding the
kids' facilities.

25:12.011 --> 25:13.746
No one was responding
from Reiden,

25:13.780 --> 25:15.214
so they're going in by force.

25:15.247 --> 25:16.683
NEWSWOMAN: Despite
the government's

25:16.716 --> 25:18.084
initial cooperation with Reiden,

25:18.117 --> 25:20.587
the lack of transparency

25:20.620 --> 25:23.890
from the Reiden officials and
the recent death of its CEO

25:23.923 --> 25:26.092
have led to today's forced entry

25:26.125 --> 25:28.728
of the Reiden Children's
Holding Facility.

25:32.832 --> 25:34.333
Charlie, you take 3.

25:34.366 --> 25:36.268
Clear.

25:36.302 --> 25:38.805
Let's go.

25:38.838 --> 25:40.773
No children inside. (shudders)

25:41.808 --> 25:43.209
Breach.

25:47.947 --> 25:49.916
Nothing.

25:49.949 --> 25:51.117
Where are they?

25:53.653 --> 25:55.354
Room clear.

25:55.387 --> 25:58.691
NEWSWOMAN: So far,
there has been no sign of the children.

25:58.725 --> 26:03.029
We are receiving word now
that the children are not,

26:03.062 --> 26:05.965
I repeat, not in the facility.

26:05.998 --> 26:08.100
No, no, no.
It's got to be a mistake.

26:08.134 --> 26:11.671
The question now is: where
have the children gone?

26:25.918 --> 26:28.988
I promise we are gonna
figure this out, okay?

26:29.021 --> 26:30.690
When-when we get
back on the plane,

26:30.723 --> 26:32.625
I'm gonna run every
test in the book.

26:32.659 --> 26:33.893
Tests?

26:33.926 --> 26:36.095
Tests, that's the last
thing that I want.

26:36.128 --> 26:38.364
Yeah, that's kind of
how science works, Clem.

26:38.397 --> 26:40.366
Thank you, Professor.
I am aware.

26:40.399 --> 26:44.370
I spent 90% of my life
under a microscope.

26:44.403 --> 26:46.773
Well, those microscopes
saved your life.

26:46.806 --> 26:48.140
It was awful.

26:48.174 --> 26:49.842
And painful.

26:49.876 --> 26:53.179
And it made me feel like...

26:53.212 --> 26:55.815
I wasn't even a person.

26:57.449 --> 27:00.619
My baby will have a normal life.

27:05.825 --> 27:09.061
You and I both know
that's not possible.

27:09.095 --> 27:12.799
Your baby is gonna be
the opposite of normal...

27:12.832 --> 27:15.835
because it's the most important
thing that has happened

27:15.868 --> 27:18.237
in a long, long time.

27:20.707 --> 27:24.243
And I understand you
want to protect your kid.

27:24.276 --> 27:26.178
And I want to protect mine.

27:30.983 --> 27:35.722
Clem, you and this baby
are all that I have.

27:39.158 --> 27:42.729
A parent has one job in life.

27:45.031 --> 27:46.933
Let me do mine.

28:01.413 --> 28:03.382
Did you get any information?

28:03.415 --> 28:05.852
No, I called my contacts
in the army and Marines.

28:05.885 --> 28:07.419
No one knows a thing.

28:07.453 --> 28:10.156
I've been on hold with the
State Department for 20 minutes.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.759
Hundreds of kids
don't just disappear.

28:12.792 --> 28:15.361
Someone saw something.

28:15.394 --> 28:17.997
We may have found something.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.499
When Logan called,
he said right before Abigail

28:20.532 --> 28:25.104
killed Leanne, she mentioned a
certain drug called Melvatox-B.

28:25.137 --> 28:26.381
When Isaac called,
he said that they were

28:26.405 --> 28:27.974
giving him candy for breakfast.

28:28.007 --> 28:29.308
What if the Melvatox-B

28:29.341 --> 28:31.978
is-is what Reiden
is giving the kids?

28:32.011 --> 28:33.512
That's exactly what
we were thinking.

28:33.545 --> 28:35.381
And it turns out that Melvatox-B

28:35.414 --> 28:37.784
has a very specific
radioactive signature.

28:37.817 --> 28:40.119
How could the government sign
off on a plan to kidnap kids

28:40.152 --> 28:41.387
and feed them poison?

28:41.420 --> 28:43.289
In low doses it's
perfectly safe.

28:43.322 --> 28:44.967
We don't think they're
trying to poison the kids.

28:44.991 --> 28:46.869
But we do think that they
gave us a way to find them.

28:46.893 --> 28:48.795
See, we're talking
about thousands of kids

28:48.828 --> 28:50.062
with thousands of doses.

28:50.096 --> 28:51.339
That would produce
a very significant

28:51.363 --> 28:52.965
radioactive footprint.

28:52.999 --> 28:53.933
TESSA: Highways have scanners

28:53.966 --> 28:56.102
that send out alerts
if there's radiation.

28:56.135 --> 28:57.804
Which cops have access to.

28:58.838 --> 29:00.339
We need to call Logan.

29:00.372 --> 29:03.375
Follow the pills, find the kids.

29:06.345 --> 29:07.880
TAD: She needs to pull through.

29:07.914 --> 29:11.183
This plan does not
work without her.

29:30.369 --> 29:33.906
(indistinct conversation)

29:33.940 --> 29:35.441
ROBERT: transfusion,

29:35.474 --> 29:37.910
but I just need to
speak to you in private.

29:37.944 --> 29:41.047
MITCH: Okay.
What can I do for you?

29:41.080 --> 29:44.350
ROBERT: I know we both
double-checked the protocol,

29:44.383 --> 29:47.920
ensured the viability
of the genomic fossils.

29:47.954 --> 29:51.858
But I need you to level with me.

29:51.891 --> 29:54.126
Is Jackson gonna
survive this procedure?

29:57.229 --> 29:59.999
Are we speaking as scientists?

30:00.032 --> 30:01.968
Or as parents?

30:05.104 --> 30:08.240
I understand.

30:08.274 --> 30:11.510
I feared as much.

30:11.543 --> 30:14.280
Look, you know I will
do whatever I can.

30:31.563 --> 30:34.300
What are you doing here?

30:34.333 --> 30:36.402
Jackson's gonna die, isn't he?

30:39.438 --> 30:44.410
If you can't cure him and
he can't cure the animals,

30:44.443 --> 30:46.445
what are you going to do?

30:50.016 --> 30:52.919
Blue Diaspora.

30:52.952 --> 30:55.121
We move on to your
plan, to the hybrids.

30:55.154 --> 30:56.155
Really?

30:56.188 --> 30:58.057
Really.

30:58.090 --> 30:59.992
But we don't have much time.

31:00.026 --> 31:01.660
Go collect all of your research.

31:01.693 --> 31:03.029
I'll be there soon.

31:03.062 --> 31:06.232
I just, I need to say good-bye.

31:14.073 --> 31:16.075
I love you, Abigail.

31:20.579 --> 31:22.881
I love you, too, Dad.

31:33.425 --> 31:36.128
Hey.

31:36.162 --> 31:40.032
You know,
if you asked me to stay,

31:40.066 --> 31:42.034
I'd consider it.

31:42.068 --> 31:44.203
That's tempting, but I can't.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.205
My only living relative
wants to kill me,

31:46.238 --> 31:49.108
so the safest place
for you is not here.

31:52.044 --> 31:55.381
Look,
your sister and your father,

31:55.414 --> 31:56.983
they're not your family.

31:57.016 --> 31:58.717
They might be your
blood relatives,

31:58.750 --> 32:02.688
but family is who
defines who you are.

32:02.721 --> 32:06.092
Abraham, Dariela,
the rest of your team,

32:06.125 --> 32:08.194
that's your family.

32:10.529 --> 32:14.967
I am so sorry that I hurt you.

32:15.001 --> 32:17.636
You are the last person

32:17.669 --> 32:21.440
that I ever wanted
to cause any pain.

32:21.473 --> 32:23.509
You saved me.

32:23.542 --> 32:26.512
When I turned my back on
this life and became Dylan,

32:26.545 --> 32:28.580
I never thought I'd
find my way back.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.116
You did that for me.

32:30.149 --> 32:33.352
How do you thank the person

32:33.385 --> 32:35.087
that gave you your life back?

32:36.355 --> 32:39.258
You go save the world, genius.

32:52.271 --> 32:53.539
You proud of yourself?

32:53.572 --> 32:54.749
CLEMENTINE: Dad, it's over.
I'm fine.

32:54.773 --> 32:56.142
I'm sorry.
You had her kidnapped.

32:56.175 --> 32:58.144
I'm so sorry.
You had her kidnapped!

32:58.177 --> 33:00.079
How does that even
compute as right to you?!

33:00.112 --> 33:01.013
It's not.

33:01.047 --> 33:05.117
A parent has one job in this
world, right?

33:07.219 --> 33:09.055
She was just doing hers.

33:18.197 --> 33:20.699
(sighs)

33:20.732 --> 33:22.434
(sniffles)

33:22.468 --> 33:27.639
I kept telling myself that I
did what any mother would do.

33:27.673 --> 33:30.242
I just wanted my son back.

33:30.276 --> 33:32.044
I'm so sorry, Clem.

33:32.078 --> 33:35.314
A few months ago,
I would've punched you in the mouth

33:35.347 --> 33:36.748
and never talked to you again.

33:37.816 --> 33:41.053
But now that I'm about
to become a mother,

33:41.087 --> 33:42.488
I would've done the same thing.

33:56.635 --> 33:59.271
♪

34:11.750 --> 34:14.420
(Abendegos snorting)

34:21.793 --> 34:23.429
(snarls, growls)

34:44.183 --> 34:45.251
What happened?

34:45.284 --> 34:46.217
When Logan and I got back,

34:46.252 --> 34:47.795
we found you passed
out in the vehicle bay,

34:47.819 --> 34:49.521
next to the new hybrid.

34:49.554 --> 34:50.889
What were you doing in there?

34:50.922 --> 34:52.291
(grunts)

34:52.324 --> 34:53.492
Where's Clem?

34:53.525 --> 34:54.893
She's with Abe.

34:54.926 --> 34:56.495
He's going to examine
her and the baby.

34:56.527 --> 34:58.764
Okay.

35:00.566 --> 35:02.234
I should be there. No.

35:02.268 --> 35:03.835
You should rest.

35:03.869 --> 35:05.604
I'm worried that that
bio-drive in your head

35:05.637 --> 35:07.439
is what made you pass out.

35:07.473 --> 35:09.217
Bio-drive or not,
I got to figure out what's going on

35:09.241 --> 35:10.376
with my daughter.

35:10.409 --> 35:12.244
Well, you can do it from here.

35:12.278 --> 35:14.646
There's years of science
for you to catch up on.

35:22.521 --> 35:23.422
What's this?

35:23.455 --> 35:25.891
It's a surveillance
photo of Mr. Duncan,

35:25.924 --> 35:27.759
Abigail's partner.

35:27.793 --> 35:29.895
He's dangerous. A monster.

35:31.630 --> 35:36.235
If I find him,
I'm going to take him down.

35:36.268 --> 35:39.205
That image is almost cleaned
up, so do your research

35:39.238 --> 35:42.641
and let me know when the
program's done with the image.

35:42.674 --> 35:44.543
Oh, and, um...

35:44.576 --> 35:45.911
rest up, Grandpa.

35:45.944 --> 35:48.680
That is so not cool.

35:58.690 --> 36:01.660
Well, the baby is healthy.

36:01.693 --> 36:03.529
If it wasn't the only
baby on the planet,

36:03.562 --> 36:06.232
I would say it was a
textbook pregnancy.

36:06.265 --> 36:08.200
What about the CLM-protein?

36:08.234 --> 36:10.969
And the stem cells from
Abendegos' spinal fluid?

36:11.002 --> 36:13.805
As long as Clem's baby
continues to develop normally,

36:13.839 --> 36:15.641
we should have
enough CLM-protein

36:15.674 --> 36:17.843
to make our synthetic
reproductive hormone.

36:19.378 --> 36:20.779
But?

36:20.812 --> 36:25.517
But I did find something
unexpected when comparing

36:25.551 --> 36:27.453
the genetic samples
from the new hybrids.

36:31.857 --> 36:33.559
(computer trills)

36:35.827 --> 36:38.597
Those shared markers prove
that the woolly rhinoceros,

36:38.630 --> 36:39.798
winged hybrid,

36:39.831 --> 36:41.700
and Abendegos are related.

36:41.733 --> 36:43.201
JACKSON: Related?

36:44.803 --> 36:47.639
What if Abigail
created the new hybrids

36:47.673 --> 36:50.509
using common DNA as
a starting point?

36:50.542 --> 36:53.245
And what that means for
us and ending sterility

36:53.279 --> 36:57.549
is that Abendegos' spinal fluid
only has part of what we need.

36:57.583 --> 36:59.451
We need the stem cells
from all the hybrids

36:59.485 --> 37:01.320
that share the genetic marker.

37:01.353 --> 37:02.621
How many are there?

37:02.654 --> 37:03.865
Given the three
samples I've seen,

37:03.889 --> 37:05.957
and their genetic variation,

37:05.991 --> 37:09.995
my best guess is that there
are six breeds altogether.

37:11.363 --> 37:12.931
There are six new hybrids,

37:12.964 --> 37:14.933
and we need spinal
fluid from each of them.

37:14.966 --> 37:16.735
How will we find them?

37:16.768 --> 37:18.470
I don't know.

37:18.504 --> 37:20.572
But if we want to stop
this reproductive problem,

37:20.606 --> 37:21.873
we need to find a way.

37:21.907 --> 37:23.709
(footsteps approaching)

37:23.742 --> 37:25.311
I think we've found the kids.

37:25.344 --> 37:26.988
Yeah, radiation signatures
are high upstate,

37:27.012 --> 37:29.381
so the kids should be there,
and the Melvatox pills.

37:30.649 --> 37:32.384
Let's go get our son back.

37:35.053 --> 37:36.722
Good news.

37:36.755 --> 37:38.023
She's turned a corner.

37:38.056 --> 37:39.825
We should be able to
pull her out soon.

37:39.858 --> 37:42.260
Good. Good job.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.936
(papers rustling)

37:52.003 --> 37:54.005
(door opens)

38:00.946 --> 38:02.348
What are you doing?

38:02.381 --> 38:03.982
I hate to do this,

38:04.015 --> 38:06.685
but, uh,
I have orders to keep you here.

38:10.956 --> 38:12.658
Orders from who?

38:12.691 --> 38:13.692
Your father.

38:13.725 --> 38:14.926
Well, is he on his way?

38:14.960 --> 38:16.395
No.

38:16.428 --> 38:17.929
No, he has to stay with Jackson.

38:17.963 --> 38:20.399
It's the only way for
the plan to succeed,

38:20.432 --> 38:21.733
cure the animals.

38:26.572 --> 38:29.408
Um...

38:29.441 --> 38:30.609
Jackson is dying.

38:30.642 --> 38:32.310
Not anymore.

38:36.648 --> 38:38.083
I got one for you:

38:38.116 --> 38:42.020
what did the, uh,
aardvark say to the taxi driver?

38:43.489 --> 38:45.724
Dad?

38:45.757 --> 38:47.993
Dad?

38:48.026 --> 38:50.729
Mitch. Mitch!

38:53.164 --> 38:58.136
(softly): Dad... no.

38:58.169 --> 38:59.571
No.

38:59.605 --> 39:01.440
No.

39:01.473 --> 39:02.474
Abigail... No.

39:02.508 --> 39:03.575
Get out of my way.

39:03.609 --> 39:05.511
Get out of my way!

39:05.544 --> 39:07.054
Robert wants it this way!
I don't care what he wants.

39:07.078 --> 39:09.481
That's my father out there!
Let go of me!

39:09.515 --> 39:10.582
Let go of me! Back off.

39:10.616 --> 39:11.517
Back off. That is my father.

39:11.550 --> 39:13.652
That is my father!

39:13.685 --> 39:14.986
That is my father!

39:15.020 --> 39:16.087
He's doing this for us.

39:16.121 --> 39:19.124
No, he is not!

39:19.157 --> 39:23.094
He's doing this for Jackson!

39:24.630 --> 39:26.998
He chose Jackson.

39:28.099 --> 39:30.068
He chose Jackson.

39:30.101 --> 39:33.905
Jackson. Jackson.

39:33.939 --> 39:37.576
Jackson. (weakly): Jackson.

39:37.609 --> 39:40.111
(groaning weakly)

39:57.028 --> 39:58.196
TECHNICIAN: Vitals are good.

39:58.229 --> 39:59.541
TECHNICIAN 2: Blood
pressure's stable.

39:59.565 --> 40:00.732
110/80.

40:00.766 --> 40:02.206
Hemoglobin levels
are at seven grams.

40:02.233 --> 40:04.436
O2, 98%.

40:04.470 --> 40:06.147
TECHNICIAN 3: Team two,
get ready to disconnect the generator

40:06.171 --> 40:07.573
and prep for extraction.

40:07.606 --> 40:08.406
TECHNICIAN 1: Everyone
move into place

40:08.440 --> 40:10.609
to remove Ms.
Westbrook from the tank.

40:12.177 --> 40:14.079
Wha... Abigail!

40:14.112 --> 40:15.481
Abigail.

40:15.514 --> 40:16.848
I've been looking for you.

40:16.882 --> 40:18.984
Everyone else evacuated.
We got to get out of here.

40:19.017 --> 40:20.418
Abigail, we got to go.

40:21.720 --> 40:23.789
Oh, you did it.

40:23.822 --> 40:25.223
You made another hybrid.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.993
I told you, Blue Diaspora
is the only way forward.

40:28.026 --> 40:29.761
We need to make sure it succeeds.
We?

40:29.795 --> 40:31.172
I don't know anything about it.
Not you.

40:31.196 --> 40:32.764
I have a chopper
hiding in Bay 12.

40:32.798 --> 40:34.500
Go get it ready.
We'll be right there.

40:34.533 --> 40:35.734
Where are you going?

40:35.767 --> 40:37.536
There's someone else we need.

40:51.883 --> 40:53.051
(barking, snarling)

40:53.084 --> 40:55.487
No! Don't! Get away from him!

41:03.662 --> 41:06.131
Okay, Dr. Morgan,
I'm gonna get you out of here.

41:06.164 --> 41:07.966
We've got a lot of work to do.

41:15.273 --> 41:16.842
TECHNICIAN: Results from the EEG

41:16.875 --> 41:19.545
are showing normal
levels of brain activity.

41:23.615 --> 41:26.618
He's going to be in
here a long time.

41:37.629 --> 41:39.631
(alarm droning)

41:42.901 --> 41:44.102
MAN: All right, extraction.

41:44.135 --> 41:45.136
WOMAN: We're ready.

41:47.773 --> 41:48.774
MAN: On it.

41:50.208 --> 41:53.745
(mechanical whirring)

41:53.779 --> 41:55.013
(Abigail gasps)

41:55.046 --> 41:58.283
(coughs, gasping)

42:09.327 --> 42:11.630
I'm fine.
Is everything in place?

42:11.663 --> 42:13.732
Almost.

42:13.765 --> 42:15.266
Abendegos is gone.

42:17.068 --> 42:18.704
Your brother has him.

42:22.841 --> 42:24.643
Well, then it's a
good thing Mr. Duncan

42:24.676 --> 42:26.778
is with my brother.
