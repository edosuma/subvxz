Yah! Yah!

00:36.837 --> 00:39.139
Why is Jill
destroying our doghouse

00:39.139 --> 00:41.942
with the sledgehammer that came
with her Gallagher costume?

00:41.942 --> 00:43.944
They canceled
"Outlander."

00:43.944 --> 00:45.045
We have to do something.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.647
Let's find a new Jill.

00:46.647 --> 00:48.015
This one's broken.

00:48.015 --> 00:50.050
No, I'll just go out
there, tilt my head,

00:50.050 --> 00:51.318
show her my belly.

00:51.318 --> 00:52.719
But if that doesn't
calm her down--

00:52.719 --> 00:54.755
I'll kill her.

00:54.755 --> 00:57.024
Oh, Jill.

00:57.024 --> 00:59.193
Oh, there you are.

00:59.193 --> 01:02.796
I have a surprise for you!

01:02.796 --> 01:03.964
Chief, you're up.

01:03.964 --> 01:05.632
Nice knowing you, lady.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.035
Ta-dog!

01:08.035 --> 01:09.236
Oh, my God, it's the house

01:09.236 --> 01:11.271
that every little puppy
dreams of.

01:11.271 --> 01:13.540
I had a big breakthrough
in therapy

01:13.540 --> 01:15.943
and accepted the fact that
I'm never going to have kids.

01:15.943 --> 01:17.911
So enjoy your new house.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.881
I'm totally fine.

01:22.182 --> 01:24.585
Chief, this place is ours.

01:24.585 --> 01:26.119
Ohh, yeah.

01:26.119 --> 01:29.122
I can't wait to pee inside you.

01:30.290 --> 01:32.559
Double-height ceilings,
separate rooms,

01:32.559 --> 01:33.994
and the commute to work--

01:33.994 --> 01:35.829
it took me 30 seconds
to get here.

01:35.929 --> 01:36.964
Well, let's go see it.

01:36.964 --> 01:38.232
I want the tour.

01:38.232 --> 01:40.667
Um, that's
definitely something

01:40.667 --> 01:42.135
we should do some time,

01:42.135 --> 01:43.370
just as soon as we're settled.

01:43.370 --> 01:44.838
Chief is still turning
around in circles

01:44.838 --> 01:47.007
trying to figure out
where to sit.

01:47.007 --> 01:48.308
Not long now!

01:48.308 --> 01:51.144
I'm sorry, are we just
going to ignore the most

01:51.144 --> 01:53.180
noteworthy thing
in this room--

01:53.180 --> 01:55.883
the fact that Tabitha
doesn't have fur.

01:55.883 --> 01:57.351
That's not Tabitha.

01:57.351 --> 01:59.186
It's obviously some
deformed baby walrus.

01:59.286 --> 02:02.222
- Gray One.
- Oh, my God, it's Tabitha!

02:02.222 --> 02:04.191
You look great.

02:04.191 --> 02:06.059
Last night,
Brett and Stelios had

02:06.059 --> 02:08.128
"RuPaul Drag Race"
watching party.

02:08.128 --> 02:09.863
<i>I was ready for big reveal.</i>

02:15.269 --> 02:18.071
I was serving Joan of Arc realness.

02:18.071 --> 02:19.940
It's like she's inside out.

02:19.940 --> 02:22.142
It's more like she's
a beautiful newborn pony

02:22.142 --> 02:23.477
trapped in a sausage casing.

02:23.577 --> 02:27.281
Excuse me? This crowd
is insulting my looks?

02:27.281 --> 02:28.849
You know,
so much of your life

02:28.849 --> 02:30.117
has been focused on appearance.

02:30.117 --> 02:32.486
This is a great opportunity
for you to explore

02:32.486 --> 02:33.253
what's on the inside.

02:33.353 --> 02:36.056
That is what is
said to ugly cats.

02:36.056 --> 02:39.526
I do not stay where
I am not worshipped.

02:39.526 --> 02:40.794
I'll go after her.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.362
I need the steps.

02:42.362 --> 02:45.866
Tabitha! Tabitha! Tabitha!

02:45.866 --> 02:47.901
Do you want some company
on your way home?

02:47.901 --> 02:49.570
I've got time.
Kevin won't miss me.

02:49.570 --> 02:51.905
Our love is beyond words,
or affection.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.908
You are feeling sorry for me?

02:54.908 --> 02:56.510
Well, I mean,
you're practically naked.

02:56.510 --> 02:58.478
Here, take this.

02:59.046 --> 03:01.548
Oof, even without
my gorgeous fur,

03:01.548 --> 03:03.951
I am still 100% that bitch.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.118
Leave me alone.

03:05.118 --> 03:08.555
Well, that's cool. Yeah,
I think I'll head home, too.

03:08.655 --> 03:09.823
It's this way.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.758
Or is it that way?

03:11.758 --> 03:13.594
Oh, my God,
it's a stray.

03:13.594 --> 03:15.095
Oh, come here

03:15.095 --> 03:16.563
sweet guy!

03:16.563 --> 03:17.965
I'm rescuing you.

03:17.965 --> 03:19.867
Let's see if he
has a microchip.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.869
Did you steal
that from the vet?

03:21.869 --> 03:23.036
They were throwing it out.

03:24.204 --> 03:26.406
Don't you worry, big fella.

03:26.406 --> 03:29.409
Before you know it, you'll
be back with your owner,

03:29.409 --> 03:30.777
Lonnie Shankman.

03:30.777 --> 03:32.045
I'm sorry, who now?

03:33.213 --> 03:35.516
I just love
this open concept,

03:35.516 --> 03:37.150
all the natural light.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.086
Wait, there's an elevator?

03:39.086 --> 03:40.954
Going up. Going down.

03:40.954 --> 03:43.123
Going up.
Going down.

03:43.123 --> 03:45.092
Going up.
- Aw, it's my turn

03:45.092 --> 03:46.860
to go up and down,
up and down.

03:46.860 --> 03:48.128
♪ Knock, knock ♪

03:48.128 --> 03:49.897

03:49.897 --> 03:51.999
Oh, my God, it's
those fancy angora bunnies

03:51.999 --> 03:53.300
from down the block.

03:53.300 --> 03:55.369
What? They've never even
talked to us before.

03:55.369 --> 03:56.803
Well, why would they?
We lived in

03:56.803 --> 03:58.772
that dilapidated doghouse.

03:58.772 --> 04:00.040
We were scum.

04:00.040 --> 04:01.408
Oh, my God, how am
I supposed to act?

04:01.408 --> 04:03.810
Act fancy.
Speak in a British accent.

04:03.810 --> 04:05.779
You must be our
new neighbors,

04:05.779 --> 04:07.281
Chip and Fluffy Bunny.

04:07.281 --> 04:09.883
Honey and Chief.
We don't have last names.

04:09.883 --> 04:13.620
Oh, Chip, isn't she precious?

04:13.620 --> 04:17.024
- Yeah, yeah, she's great.
- Welcome to the neighborhood.

04:17.024 --> 04:19.193
Now that you live here,
you are part of

04:19.193 --> 04:21.195
an elite club
of homeowners.

04:21.195 --> 04:23.664
Well, you got the Sparrows,

04:23.764 --> 04:25.032
the Catses,

04:25.032 --> 04:28.035
And King Poopy Pants
McWhiskers III.

04:28.035 --> 04:31.205
He hasn't left the castle
since his anus prolapsed.

04:31.205 --> 04:33.407
Well, we must get to
know each other better.

04:33.407 --> 04:35.676
Are you free for dinner
and drinks tonight?

04:35.676 --> 04:37.544
Absolutely!

04:37.544 --> 04:38.879
Sounds divine.

04:38.879 --> 04:41.014
Chief, do you have
anything fancy to add?

04:41.014 --> 04:42.683
Heh.
I could do worse

04:42.683 --> 04:44.384
than a schmooze and a nosh.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.521
OK.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.656
See you tonight.

04:49.656 --> 04:51.091
What the hell was that?

04:51.091 --> 04:53.227
You told me to speak
with a Yiddish accent.

04:53.227 --> 04:56.063
British, Chief.
A British accent.

04:56.063 --> 04:58.498
Heh, you tell me this now?

05:00.067 --> 05:02.035
Even without my fur, I am--

05:02.035 --> 05:03.937
Cream of the cat crop.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.973
That is what
I was going to say.

05:05.973 --> 05:08.208
Are you the devil?
- Devilish.

05:08.208 --> 05:09.977
My name is Claude.
I'm surprised

05:09.977 --> 05:11.011
we've never met before.

05:11.011 --> 05:13.013
I thought I knew all the
follicle-divergent cats

05:13.013 --> 05:15.682
in the neighborhood.
- Oh, well, you don't know me.

05:15.682 --> 05:16.917
Hold on there. Arrogant,

05:16.917 --> 05:18.785
emotionally closed off,

05:18.785 --> 05:20.220
skin that won't quit?

05:20.220 --> 05:23.056
You are crazy if you think
I'm gonna give up that easy.

05:23.056 --> 05:25.692
And you are crazy to think

05:25.692 --> 05:27.461
that you are in my league.

05:27.461 --> 05:30.797
But what the hell, follow me,
and I will continue

05:30.797 --> 05:32.599
to reject you all the way home.

05:36.203 --> 05:38.639
Guys, I think
there's been a mistake.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.574
My owner's name is Kevin.

05:40.574 --> 05:41.909
Rhymes with heaven.

05:41.909 --> 05:43.610
This is it.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.848
Can I help you?

05:47.848 --> 05:50.817
Oh, my God! Prince!
Is that you?

05:50.817 --> 05:52.753
No. No, it's not.

05:54.821 --> 05:56.857
It's just so gratifying.

05:59.927 --> 06:02.062
Chief, I asked you
to put out the pig ears

06:02.062 --> 06:03.730
and uncork the squirrel pee.

06:03.730 --> 06:04.898
The Bunnies will be here soon.

06:06.033 --> 06:08.202
What was that?

06:08.202 --> 06:11.205
One of
the floor boards is loose.

06:11.205 --> 06:13.273
Why do you sound like
Jay Leno after a stroke?

06:13.273 --> 06:16.710
I'm perfecting
my British accent.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.312
Blah!
- Keep working on it.

06:18.312 --> 06:20.714
In the meantime,
can you fix the floorboard?

06:20.814 --> 06:22.182
Uh, no.
I'll call a handyman.

06:22.182 --> 06:25.886
Raccoon!
We need your hands, man!

06:27.120 --> 06:29.857
And there's the two of us
on Santa's lap

06:29.857 --> 06:31.925
the two of us in Cabo.

06:31.925 --> 06:35.996
Oh, my Prince, I am so
sorry for losing you.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.632
And you're losing me now.

06:38.632 --> 06:40.033
Listen, Lonnie, was it?

06:40.033 --> 06:42.069
I have an owner.
- Do you still like scratches

06:42.169 --> 06:44.605
on your special spot?

06:45.038 --> 06:49.209

So I said, "I don't care
if you call me Bugs Bunny,

06:57.951 --> 07:00.521
just as long as
I get that carrot."

07:03.090 --> 07:04.992
So did she get
the carrot or--

07:04.992 --> 07:06.493
I don't know.
Just laugh.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.730

- Nope.

Oh, Lonnie,
I didn't know I was lost

08:22.503 --> 08:25.172
until I was found by you.

08:28.876 --> 08:30.644
Oh! I almost forgot.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.279
Prince, this is Paul.

08:32.379 --> 08:35.415
He's a friend I made while you
were taking a bathroom break

08:35.516 --> 08:36.650
in the sandbox.

08:36.650 --> 08:40.554
Um, Lonnie, what the
hell's going on here?

08:40.554 --> 08:42.189
I thought I was your friend.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.328
I mean, at first,
Lonnie couldn't

08:48.328 --> 08:49.296
have been more attentive.

08:49.463 --> 08:52.966
And he stroked me like
an ever-loving Bond villain.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.269
But ever since
Paul came along,

08:55.269 --> 08:57.371
Lonnie doesn't sharpen knives
with me anymore.

08:57.371 --> 08:59.406
He doesn't shop for
plastic sheeting with me.

08:59.406 --> 09:03.277
Well, what's so great
about Paul, besides his name?

09:03.277 --> 09:05.779
Beats me. He just sits
in the basement screaming,

09:05.779 --> 09:08.015
"Help! Help!"
24 hours a day.

09:08.015 --> 09:09.316
Why don't you just
go back to Kevin

talking about this?

09:11.018 --> 09:12.586
New Chico.
Who Kevin?

09:12.586 --> 09:13.887
Well, as a homeowner,

09:13.887 --> 09:15.289
I get the plastic sheeting part.

09:15.289 --> 09:17.324
But why would you want
your knives to be dull?

09:17.324 --> 09:20.394
Like this conversation
until I started speaking.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.829
There is a cat who
is obsessed with me.

09:22.829 --> 09:24.231
Is her name Tabitha?

09:24.231 --> 09:26.700
No, he is he/him,
named Claude.

09:26.700 --> 09:28.769
He wants to torture and
kill a mouse with me.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.337
So obviously,
he knows a good time.

09:30.337 --> 09:33.707
But he is hairless and
disgusting to look at.

09:33.707 --> 09:35.442
And I have standards.

09:35.442 --> 09:36.410
Ugh, we know.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.545
Maybe it's time to
lower those standards,

09:38.545 --> 09:41.582
not that you're not the
prettiest pickled pig fetus

09:41.582 --> 09:42.583
at the science fair.

09:42.583 --> 09:44.551
But you could use
this as an opportunity

09:44.551 --> 09:47.788
to connect with another cat
on a more meaningful level.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.323
That's rich.

09:49.423 --> 09:52.793
Why don't you lower
your standards?

09:52.793 --> 09:54.328
Uh, what's happening?

09:54.328 --> 09:56.430
Your precious therapist threw
a dinner party last night,

09:56.430 --> 10:00.801
which I wasn't allowed to crash
because I'm not fancy enough.

10:00.801 --> 10:02.736
Honey, if this is true,
I find it

10:02.736 --> 10:04.738
completely unforgivable.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.206
- Thank you.
- That you would throw

10:06.206 --> 10:09.376
a dinner party
and not invite us?

10:09.376 --> 10:11.144
What do you think,
you're better than us?

10:11.144 --> 10:13.280
No, no, not better, per se.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.682
Gah, next you're going
to be selling a candle that

10:15.682 --> 10:17.050
smells like your poop shoot.

10:17.050 --> 10:19.186
- I'll take one.
- Make that two.

10:19.186 --> 10:20.921
But ever since
you got that house,

10:20.921 --> 10:22.055
that's all you care about.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.957
- That's not true.
- Prove it.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.527
Um--um, I--

10:26.527 --> 10:27.928
how about this?

10:27.928 --> 10:30.297
I let you have the house
all to yourself tonight.

10:30.397 --> 10:32.466
Chief and I will just slum
it in the laundry room,

10:32.466 --> 10:34.768
like the rest of you
commoners, um, creatures.

10:34.768 --> 10:36.303
You mean it?

10:36.303 --> 10:39.673
You'll let me stay in your
precious special mansion?

10:39.673 --> 10:40.774
Yeah, it's yours.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.976
OK, then, thank
you very much.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.278
So this butt candle--

10:44.278 --> 10:46.013
do I have to light
it for the smell?

10:46.013 --> 10:48.182
And can I get it
as a bath bomb?

10:49.383 --> 10:52.686
Mmm, this food
has very interesting texture.

10:52.686 --> 10:54.321
How do you pronounce it again?

10:54.321 --> 10:56.056
Gordita.

10:56.056 --> 10:58.192
Stop right there.
I must paint you.

10:58.192 --> 11:01.428
Oh, well, I have
certainly looked better, but--

11:01.428 --> 11:05.732
Us hairless cats have to let
go of what others think of us.

11:05.732 --> 11:08.001
Yes, us hairless cats.

11:08.001 --> 11:09.770
Besides, I'm not
painting how you look.

11:09.770 --> 11:12.639
I am painting who you are.

11:13.874 --> 11:15.576
- Tell me something true.
- OK.

11:15.576 --> 11:16.877
No, not from your head,

11:16.877 --> 11:19.012
from your spirit.
- Well--

11:19.012 --> 11:22.916
Tell me your biggest fear
from the deepest chasm

11:22.916 --> 11:24.218
of your soul.

11:24.218 --> 11:26.019
All right, I've built
up a wall around me

11:26.119 --> 11:27.788
that will keep me
from ever truly

11:27.788 --> 11:29.456
connecting with another cat!

11:30.991 --> 11:34.094
Well, I wouldn't worry
about that anymore.

11:34.094 --> 11:37.431
It's beautiful.

11:37.431 --> 11:38.298
What do you see?

11:38.298 --> 11:41.001
I see me.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.948
Oh, hey, Scabitha,
still seeing

11:54.948 --> 11:56.783
that wrinkled bag of pink?

11:56.783 --> 11:58.519
Yes, I'm still seeing Claude,

11:58.519 --> 12:01.989
who I don't even notice
is incredibly hideous,

12:01.989 --> 12:03.390
because I am in love.

12:03.390 --> 12:05.626
I wonder, what's
going to happen when

12:05.626 --> 12:07.060
your hair starts growing back?

12:07.060 --> 12:09.029
Claude doesn't care
what I look like.

12:09.029 --> 12:10.697
Now, that's obvious.

12:10.697 --> 12:13.166
But he might care
that you lied.

12:13.734 --> 12:15.435
Oh, crap.

12:17.838 --> 12:19.840
There's my one and only.

12:19.840 --> 12:21.675
Want to rub my belly,
big felly?

12:22.276 --> 12:24.311
You stay here, buddy.
Daddy's just running out

12:24.311 --> 12:29.049
to get some more hydrochloric
acid and piano wire for Paul.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.686
Paul, Paul, Paul.

12:32.686 --> 12:34.955
Where's my hydrochloric piano?

12:34.955 --> 12:37.858
Help! Help me!
I've been abducted.

12:37.858 --> 12:39.326
Can anybody hear me?

12:39.326 --> 12:41.562
My name is Paul Pressman.

12:41.562 --> 12:45.766
OK, Paul, there's not
enough Lonnie for both of us.

12:48.468 --> 12:49.736
Just let go, Paul.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.104
Don't fight it!

12:52.639 --> 12:55.542
Oh! Oh, I'm free!

13:01.048 --> 13:02.649
And stay out!

13:07.754 --> 13:10.791
- Whoa!
- Yeah! It's more fun!

13:10.791 --> 13:11.892
Whoa!

13:11.892 --> 13:13.427
Oh!

13:15.596 --> 13:17.164
Again!

13:17.164 --> 13:19.366
What the hell?

13:20.801 --> 13:22.803
I need you to shave me.

13:23.837 --> 13:25.205
Chief, do you hear that?

13:25.205 --> 13:28.208
Raccoon and his friends
are tearing up the place.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.043
What will
King Poopy Pants think?

13:30.043 --> 13:32.312
Then just go
shut the party down.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.314
After I promised
Raccoon the house?

13:34.314 --> 13:37.184
I can't have him
thinking I'm a D-bag.

13:37.184 --> 13:39.052
Ooh, but I don't care
what he thinks about Jill.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.922
Jill!

13:41.922 --> 13:44.625
Now, this blade may
be a little worn down.

13:44.625 --> 13:46.393
My last client was a porcupine.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.796
Raid!

13:52.900 --> 13:54.835
No, you have to finish.

13:54.835 --> 13:56.103
Sorry, cat,
it's Animal Control,

13:56.103 --> 13:57.871
and I've already
got two strikes.

13:59.473 --> 14:01.074
Ugh, here.

14:01.742 --> 14:02.809
Now, run!

14:05.379 --> 14:06.079
Ah! No!

14:06.079 --> 14:09.616
Ah, ugh! Poodle set me up.

14:11.051 --> 14:12.252
Wow.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.488
I didn't know Jill
would call the po-po.

14:14.488 --> 14:15.422
Just wow.

14:15.622 --> 14:17.324
I thought she was just
going to get her umbrella

14:17.324 --> 14:19.693
and open and close
it really fast.

14:19.793 --> 14:21.028
What's going
to happen to him?

14:21.028 --> 14:22.095
Don't worry.
He won't be killed.

14:22.095 --> 14:25.232
We're just going to relocate
him deep into the woods.

14:25.232 --> 14:27.467
- Where he'll be killed.
- He'll be fine.

14:27.467 --> 14:31.371
He's a wild animal, who cuts
hair, brews his own kombucha,

14:31.371 --> 14:33.907
and cries at YouTube videos
of deaf babies

14:33.907 --> 14:35.809
hearing their mom's voice
for the first time.

14:35.809 --> 14:37.644
Oh, my God, he's gonna
die out there.

14:43.183 --> 14:45.319
Hey, get out of there,
you filthy, freaky mole rat.

14:45.319 --> 14:47.821
- Gray One.
- Oh, hey, Tabitha,

14:47.821 --> 14:49.189
you look great.

14:49.189 --> 14:50.891
- What are you doing here?
- A couple of foxes

14:50.991 --> 14:53.060
told me about the wild party.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.228
What are you doing?

14:54.228 --> 14:56.330
Looking for Raccoon's razor,
or maybe

14:56.330 --> 14:57.965
laser hair removal Groupon.

14:57.965 --> 14:59.800
I have a date with
Claude soon, and I have

14:59.800 --> 15:01.368
to find a way to lose this.

15:01.368 --> 15:05.172
Oh, Tabs, if you never
show him your true self,

15:05.172 --> 15:08.742
you'll never get a chance to be
loved for who you really are.

15:08.742 --> 15:10.477
That is beautiful.

15:10.577 --> 15:11.445
Oh, that's not me.

15:11.612 --> 15:13.814
That's a line from the
upcoming Broadway musical

15:13.814 --> 15:15.215
"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days."

15:15.315 --> 15:17.317

thing and tell the truth,

15:17.317 --> 15:19.119

Finally, some quality time.

15:36.637 --> 15:38.138
What should we do first?

15:38.138 --> 15:39.840
I could nuzzle
up in your boxers

15:39.840 --> 15:40.908
while you go to the bathroom.

15:42.376 --> 15:45.779

Where'd Paul go?

15:46.813 --> 15:49.149

16:01.762 --> 16:04.698
Ahh!

16:06.333 --> 16:09.870
Honey, we've been looking
for over two nap cycles.

16:09.970 --> 16:11.605
This is more like hound work.

16:11.605 --> 16:13.140
Well, we don't
know any hounds.

16:13.140 --> 16:14.875
Besides, this is your fault.

16:14.875 --> 16:16.243
If you knew
how to fix a floorboard,

16:16.243 --> 16:18.245
I never would have been
embarrassed by Raccoon

16:18.245 --> 16:20.047
and tried to distance myself
from him,

humiliating him
in front of those bunnies

16:22.015 --> 16:23.550

Don't turn this around on me,

16:26.687 --> 16:27.955

16:27.955 --> 16:30.324
You'll just be mad
at your old self.

16:30.424 --> 16:31.959
Still not British.
But you're right.

16:31.959 --> 16:33.260
I'm sorry.

16:40.534 --> 16:42.236

16:43.303 --> 16:45.339
Up yonder?
That's Deers,

16:45.339 --> 16:47.908
our friendly neighborhood
watering hole,

16:47.908 --> 16:50.210
where everybody
knows your name.

16:50.210 --> 16:53.580
Hey, I know my name!

16:55.616 --> 16:57.551
Hello, there.

16:59.887 --> 17:01.688

17:10.063 --> 17:12.933
Little Lord Dogleroy.

17:12.933 --> 17:15.369
Now is when you
nail the accent?

17:17.237 --> 17:19.339
Hey, beautiful,
you ready to take a walk?

17:19.339 --> 17:22.442
Claude, there is-- there is
something I need to tell you.

17:22.442 --> 17:24.978
Well, go ahead, babe. You
know you can tell me anything.

17:24.978 --> 17:26.547
Maybe it's better I show you.

17:26.547 --> 17:27.981
Please remove kerchief.

17:31.084 --> 17:33.954
You're a hairy.

17:33.954 --> 17:35.455
I don't know what to say.

17:35.455 --> 17:36.256
I'm sorry I lied.

17:36.356 --> 17:38.725
It's OK.
I understand why you lied.

17:38.725 --> 17:39.793
You had to.

17:39.793 --> 17:41.061
You're disgusting.

17:41.061 --> 17:43.030
You're grossed out by me?

17:43.030 --> 17:44.965
I'm just not a hair guy.

17:44.965 --> 17:47.034
But I-- I was grossed
out by you first.

17:47.034 --> 17:48.936
I can't believe
we almost barbed.

17:48.936 --> 17:51.071
And I can't believe
I was almost attracted

17:51.071 --> 17:54.775
to what was on the inside.

17:59.112 --> 18:03.851
First Lonnie, then
Kevin, then Lonnie again.

18:03.851 --> 18:05.953
Maybe I'm just
destined to be alone.

18:05.953 --> 18:07.788
There you are, Chico.

18:07.788 --> 18:08.822
Kevin!

18:08.822 --> 18:10.390
I saw you on the news.

18:10.390 --> 18:12.726
Come here, my big, brave buddy.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.396
You have no idea
how much I missed you.

18:16.396 --> 18:19.366
Dude, my cat just, like,
totally prevented a murder.

18:19.366 --> 18:21.668
There's usually
a reward for that, right?

18:21.668 --> 18:24.071
I have an extra ticket to

18:38.986 --> 18:42.289
and drink out of your own
personalized dog bowls?

18:42.289 --> 18:44.658
I would
like to nip off about now.

18:44.658 --> 18:45.826
Drop the accent.

18:45.826 --> 18:48.095
What accent?
Oh, no.

18:48.095 --> 18:49.863
I can't get rid of it.

18:49.863 --> 18:51.298

19:00.374 --> 19:01.542
Crap.

19:01.542 --> 19:03.143
How about a little
less conversation

19:03.143 --> 19:06.280
and a little more mutilation?

19:07.781 --> 19:08.916
Back off, Bob.

19:08.916 --> 19:10.584
Whatever you say, Thumbs.

19:10.584 --> 19:12.052
Oh, Raccoon.

19:12.052 --> 19:14.655
It's no fun being treated
like an outsider, is it?

19:14.655 --> 19:16.056
Wait!

19:16.823 --> 19:18.258
Raccoon, wait.

19:18.258 --> 19:22.029
I can't believe you saved me,
especially after last night.

19:22.029 --> 19:23.197
And tomorrow,
you're going to go

19:23.197 --> 19:25.666
right back to your easy,
domesticated life

19:25.666 --> 19:28.602
and right back to seeing
me as some dirty animal

19:28.602 --> 19:29.770
who lives in a shed.

19:29.770 --> 19:32.072
But you do live in a shed.

19:32.072 --> 19:35.042
And the rest of the time,
you're in garbage cans, so--

19:35.042 --> 19:37.978
Well, not everything
in garbage cans

19:37.978 --> 19:40.214
likes to be treated
like garbage.

19:40.214 --> 19:43.050
I've been underestimated
my whole life.

19:43.050 --> 19:45.185
But it hurts the
most when you do it.

19:45.185 --> 19:47.187
Wait, isn't that
from your one-raccoon show

19:47.187 --> 19:49.957
after your dad says
you'll never be an architect?

19:49.957 --> 19:52.659
Technically, yes,
but it still applies.

19:52.659 --> 19:54.094
You're right.

19:54.094 --> 19:56.597
I got so caught up in
keeping up with the Bunnies

19:56.597 --> 19:57.464
I forgot who my friends are.

19:57.564 --> 19:59.733
- I'm your friend.
- Of course you are.

19:59.733 --> 20:02.836
And I hope you can forgive
me because the floorboard

20:02.836 --> 20:04.438
is doing that thing again.

20:04.438 --> 20:07.741
I'm kidding. I mean, I'm not
kidding about the floorboard.

20:07.741 --> 20:09.142
It still squeaks.

20:09.142 --> 20:10.777
But I'd hope that you'd
fix it as a friend

20:10.777 --> 20:12.112
and not as a handyman.

20:12.112 --> 20:14.748
You know, friends do favors
for each other, too.

20:14.748 --> 20:16.049
I'm glad you're not dead.

20:16.049 --> 20:18.218
If that was an apology,
I forgive you.

20:19.853 --> 20:21.989
You know, friends
also give friends

20:21.989 --> 20:23.924
free poodle rides for a month.

20:23.924 --> 20:27.794
Free poo--
Fine. Get on.

20:27.794 --> 20:30.364
To Deers!

20:36.003 --> 20:37.905
I want to apologize for not
welcoming you all

20:37.905 --> 20:39.273
into my home sooner.

20:39.273 --> 20:41.875
Tabitha, it's good to
not see your face again

20:41.875 --> 20:43.644
because of the hair.

20:43.644 --> 20:44.811
No, I got it.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.413
So how are
things with Claude?

20:46.413 --> 20:47.781
You mean Fraud?

20:47.781 --> 20:49.983
Hmph. I dump him way
before he dump me.

20:49.983 --> 20:51.952
Yes, this whole
time I worry that I am

20:51.952 --> 20:53.921
not enough on the inside.

20:53.921 --> 20:55.289
But then my hair grew back.

20:55.289 --> 20:57.958
And I realize
my outside is enough.

20:57.958 --> 21:00.427
Aww! Well, I wasn't
enough for Lonnie.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.596
And now he's being held in
the federal detention center

21:02.596 --> 21:03.430
on eight counts of murder.

21:03.530 --> 21:05.299
Darling, wee fun Raccoon

21:05.299 --> 21:07.901
is putting a gas fireplace
in the primary bedroom.

21:07.901 --> 21:09.436
He's not certified for that.

21:12.806 --> 21:15.008
Oh, no!

21:15.008 --> 21:18.579
The explosion knocked
the British out of me.

21:18.579 --> 21:21.014
And all our hair off, again.

21:21.014 --> 21:22.316
Sorry about your house.

21:22.316 --> 21:24.151
Eh, it's probably
for the best.

21:24.151 --> 21:26.720
So do you guys
have insurance?

21:26.720 --> 21:29.623
Or do none of us
know what that is?

21:32.759 --> 21:34.761
Bento.

21:35.762 --> 21:36.730
<i>That's nice, Jen and Gabby.</i>
