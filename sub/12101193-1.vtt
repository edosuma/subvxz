00:59.309 --> 01:01.345
You know she wants you to sing.

01:33.745 --> 01:34.946
How long are you in town for?

01:36.213 --> 01:37.547
As little as possible.

01:40.618 --> 01:44.254
Do you got any gigs coming up?

01:45.623 --> 01:46.658
No.

02:12.684 --> 02:15.318
Hey,
do you- do you think he'll show up?

02:15.352 --> 02:16.353
Who?

02:16.386 --> 02:17.689

Darren...

03:42.607 --> 03:43.373
Hey, thanks for coming.

03:43.406 --> 03:45.743
I... I wish
you could stay longer.

03:45.777 --> 03:48.445
I could send you some money
to cover your flight, honey.

03:48.478 --> 03:51.314
It's fine,
and you don't have any, so...

03:55.787 --> 03:57.487
What you doing with those?

04:02.059 --> 04:03.326
Taking them with me.

04:05.428 --> 04:07.799
You know, you can always ask
your father for money.

04:08.666 --> 04:09.867
Bye, Mom.

04:18.576 --> 04:19.376
Arm...

04:21.913 --> 04:25.817
When your sister comes
to visit you for reading week,

04:25.850 --> 04:28.853
don't let her get too drunk
partying, okay?

04:28.886 --> 04:30.621
She still has to study.

04:32.957 --> 04:34.792
Is that what you think
I do all the time?

04:36.794 --> 04:39.063
Honey, I have no idea
what you do.

05:04.155 --> 05:05.623
Oh, fuck.

05:13.831 --> 05:15.800
Hey!

05:15.833 --> 05:17.400
Holy shit!

05:17.434 --> 05:18.870
You made it.

05:18.903 --> 05:20.037
Barely.

05:20.071 --> 05:21.606
Do you have an extra pair
of heels?

05:21.639 --> 05:22.673
No. Sorry, dude.

05:22.707 --> 05:23.708
Fuck!

05:26.744 --> 05:27.979
Do you think he'll notice?

05:34.085 --> 05:34.986
Here.

05:37.688 --> 05:38.956
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

05:45.563 --> 05:46.463
What do you think?
What if I do this?

05:46.496 --> 05:47.497
Will he notice then?

05:47.530 --> 05:48.933
- "Sorry, Chef Dan.
- Oh.

05:48.966 --> 05:50.067
Oh, don't look at my feet,
Chef Dan."

05:50.101 --> 05:51.969
"Oh, look that way, Chef Dan."

06:01.478 --> 06:02.980
Would you like...?

06:08.753 --> 06:10.621
I'm still here.

06:10.655 --> 06:12.522
I think back in the
beginning of my career...

06:12.556 --> 06:13.858
Oh, no thanks, honey.

06:13.891 --> 06:15.993
Um, and, you know,
getting started back with...

06:17.128 --> 06:18.362
Do they not like the food?

06:18.396 --> 06:21.165
People think they look more rich
when they turn down free food.

06:34.879 --> 06:36.647
And, uh, so you think...

06:36.681 --> 06:37.547
Wow.

06:39.150 --> 06:40.584
Isn't that what's her face?

06:40.618 --> 06:42.586
Mmm.
Oh, yeah. Damn.

06:42.620 --> 06:44.555
She hasn't worked in a while.

06:44.588 --> 06:45.756
Chef used to love her.

06:48.559 --> 06:49.927
Fuck.
The cake.

06:49.961 --> 06:52.763
...has been drinking in
the bar and he's had way too many.

06:52.797 --> 06:54.598
You know, the thing
with Richard is that

06:54.632 --> 06:56.600
he has travelled
all around the world,

06:56.634 --> 06:58.869
he knows his scotch,
he knows his whiskey.

06:58.903 --> 07:00.738
Give him a wine list...

07:00.771 --> 07:01.839
he doesn't know red from white.

07:02.940 --> 07:05.042
You know,
just whatever's in the bottle.

07:05.076 --> 07:06.711
Whatever.

07:06.744 --> 07:08.012
She's good with wine.

07:08.045 --> 07:09.246
So, I order the wine.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.150
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

07:13.184 --> 07:14.285
Okay.

07:14.318 --> 07:15.820
Oh...

07:15.853 --> 07:16.721
Where was I?

07:16.754 --> 07:17.621
Oh, yes.

07:17.655 --> 07:20.191
So, we were talking about
this one case...

07:22.660 --> 07:24.195
So, um...

07:28.666 --> 07:29.734
Can I get you a drink?

07:29.767 --> 07:32.703
Oh, no, thanks.
I'm good.

07:32.737 --> 07:34.572
I think we, uh, catered
a few weddings together

07:34.605 --> 07:35.773
last summer.

07:35.806 --> 07:37.108
Oh, yeah.

07:37.141 --> 07:37.975
Hey, how are you?

07:38.009 --> 07:39.276
Good, yeah.

07:39.310 --> 07:40.211
Are you not catering anymore?

07:40.244 --> 07:41.278
No.
God, no.

07:41.312 --> 07:43.147
Just perpetual student.

07:43.180 --> 07:44.849
Law student?
Is that why you're at this...

07:44.882 --> 07:45.649
Oh, no, no, no.

07:45.683 --> 07:48.252
I'm, uh, just here
with a friend.

07:48.285 --> 07:49.286
That guy?

07:49.320 --> 07:50.688
Is your, uh...

07:50.721 --> 07:52.857
Oh, no, no.
We're not together.

07:52.890 --> 07:54.025
It's just for tonight.

07:58.295 --> 08:01.599
It's... it's like
a paid dating thing

08:01.632 --> 08:02.466
for rich older men.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.068
It's still pretty much
a stand there

08:04.101 --> 08:05.903
and look pretty job,
but it pays a lot better

08:05.936 --> 08:08.572
and it's a lot less work.

08:08.606 --> 08:11.609
Anyway, it's putting me
through grad school, so...

08:11.642 --> 08:13.543
- It's nice to see you.
- Yeah, you, too. Bye.

08:28.826 --> 08:30.227
Abort, abort, abort, abort...

08:30.261 --> 08:30.761

08:30.795 --> 08:32.096
Abort, abort, abort.

08:32.129 --> 08:34.065
Right here.

08:34.098 --> 08:35.699
Darren...

08:39.703 --> 08:40.604
That's it.

08:46.077 --> 08:47.078
Uh, hi.

08:47.111 --> 08:49.680
I'm wondering if you guys
are hiring right now.

08:50.781 --> 08:51.882

Sound good, though.

12:39.977 --> 12:41.545
Guess what?

12:41.579 --> 12:43.581
The bike co-op's doing
an exchange with the butcher,

12:43.615 --> 12:46.116
so we got meat in the freezer.

13:03.200 --> 13:04.401
You all right?

13:04.435 --> 13:07.471
Um... I got fired.

13:07.504 --> 13:09.206
- From babysitting?
- Catering.

13:12.042 --> 13:15.312
Listen, Pete,
I'm going to be short 200

13:15.346 --> 13:16.581
for rent this month.

13:17.448 --> 13:19.316
Shit.

13:19.350 --> 13:22.086
I just... I can't keep...

13:22.119 --> 13:23.287
You know?

13:27.991 --> 13:29.226
You'll find another job.

13:29.259 --> 13:30.260
It's not that.

13:30.294 --> 13:32.664
I moved here so I could work
on my music and...

13:32.697 --> 13:33.497
What happened?

13:33.530 --> 13:35.432
- Your music is like...
- Like what?

13:35.466 --> 13:37.602
Nothing you've ever heard
before?

13:37.635 --> 13:39.370
Yeah, nothing no one's
ever heard before.

13:41.438 --> 13:43.107
I can't even call myself
a musician.

13:43.140 --> 13:45.442
I'm a...

13:45.476 --> 13:49.213
...university drop-out
slash ex-caterer,

13:49.246 --> 13:51.281
server, babysitter.

13:51.315 --> 13:52.516
I spend, like,
every hour of my day

13:52.549 --> 13:53.417
just trying to pay rent

13:53.450 --> 13:55.486
and I seem to suck at that too,
so...

13:55.519 --> 13:58.656
I mean, you can start
an online business, or...

13:58.690 --> 14:01.458
find a rich patron of the arts.

14:01.492 --> 14:02.960
Aren't there arts grants for,
like...

14:02.993 --> 14:04.662
Yeah, right.

14:04.696 --> 14:06.964
I'm gonna get an arts grant?

14:06.997 --> 14:08.999
Yeah!

14:09.032 --> 14:11.235
You have, like,
a fancy scholarship for you PhD.

14:13.370 --> 14:16.440
If we got hitched,
would I get some?

14:16.473 --> 14:18.308
Um...

14:20.244 --> 14:21.579
No.

14:24.214 --> 14:25.382
Bummer.

15:26.243 --> 15:28.245
I like the first one you
said, with the brocade.

15:28.278 --> 15:31.381
The brocade is
fantastic, it's from the 1940's.

15:31.415 --> 15:33.517
And then, come,
this one from the '50s.

15:33.550 --> 15:35.118
Oh, did...
has she seen that?

15:35.152 --> 15:36.220
Do you like this?

15:36.253 --> 15:37.221
Oh, the red's nice, too.

15:37.254 --> 15:38.422
Oh, did she see this?

15:38.455 --> 15:40.758
- What do you think?
- Hmm?

15:40.792 --> 15:42.125
Oh, yeah.
They're nice.

15:42.159 --> 15:43.427
- That's nice.
- These are very nice.

15:43.460 --> 15:44.461
They're nice.

15:44.495 --> 15:45.329
That is nice.

15:45.362 --> 15:46.330
Of course, it's nice...

16:05.282 --> 16:06.416
I can see that
you're more interested

16:06.450 --> 16:07.417
in another dress.

16:07.451 --> 16:08.653
Perhaps the blue dress?

16:08.686 --> 16:10.220
How about we give that one
a try?

16:10.254 --> 16:11.221
Uh, no.
I'm good.

16:11.255 --> 16:12.557
Are you sure you wouldn't want
to try it on?

16:12.590 --> 16:13.123
I'll bring it
to the changing room.

16:13.156 --> 16:14.525
No I'm fine, actually.

16:14.559 --> 16:15.727
Oh yeah, stick it
in a room for her.

16:15.760 --> 16:18.428
No...

16:18.462 --> 16:20.330
I'm okay.
Thanks.

16:20.364 --> 16:22.499
Oh, sorry.

16:22.533 --> 16:23.568
Thanks, Carmalita.

16:23.601 --> 16:25.235
Okay, Jim.

16:25.269 --> 16:26.270
Oh...

16:26.303 --> 16:27.739
Um...

16:27.772 --> 16:29.540
it's getting late
and I can't go to

16:29.574 --> 16:30.407
any more stores, so...

16:30.440 --> 16:33.745
What's your opinion
about symphonies?

16:33.778 --> 16:35.512
What?

16:35.546 --> 16:39.216
Women who are...
who listen un-attentively.

16:39.249 --> 16:42.720
Either you gotta act like
you're paying attention,

16:42.754 --> 16:46.423
or you've got to, um...

16:46.456 --> 16:48.091
just listen, you know?

16:48.125 --> 16:49.694
Just because I've contributed,

16:49.727 --> 16:52.830
I've been a Gold Donor
to the DuBose Orchestra

16:52.864 --> 16:56.300
for over 30 years, doesn't mean
it's your cup of tea.

16:56.333 --> 16:57.167
Does it?

16:57.200 --> 16:58.502
No.

16:58.535 --> 17:00.270
That's the benefits of
having that exclusive membership,

17:00.304 --> 17:01.773
right?
You understand?

17:01.806 --> 17:03.173
Yeah.

17:03.206 --> 17:06.410
Why don't we do this?
Why don't we, um...

17:06.443 --> 17:09.681
every second Thursday,
that's every other Thursday,

17:09.714 --> 17:13.517
we meet and I pay you $300
just for your attention,

17:13.550 --> 17:14.819
would that be okay with you?

17:18.823 --> 17:20.424
- Can I think about it?
- Oh, yeah, of course.

17:20.457 --> 17:22.225
Of course you can.

17:22.259 --> 17:24.562
So, what about to...
what about...

17:24.596 --> 17:26.631
What about for today?

17:26.664 --> 17:27.832
- Oh.
- Here you go, Jim.

17:31.736 --> 17:33.403
Beautiful dresses for her.

17:36.908 --> 17:38.308
You're okay.

18:32.597 --> 18:34.364
Oh!
Uh, can you help me?

18:34.398 --> 18:36.400
Huh?

18:36.433 --> 18:38.368
Oh. Yeah.

18:40.972 --> 18:42.406
Thanks.

18:45.442 --> 18:46.410
Okay.

19:13.571 --> 19:15.372
Hey, Gordon.
How're you doing?

19:20.544 --> 19:22.379
Oh, don't get up.

19:22.412 --> 19:23.380
Hello.

19:23.413 --> 19:24.982
Hello.

19:25.016 --> 19:26.584
I'm Gordon.

19:26.617 --> 19:27.719
D.

19:27.752 --> 19:29.654
Nice to meet you.

19:29.687 --> 19:33.457
Now, my dear,
the most important question

19:33.490 --> 19:34.959
I will ever ask you...

19:37.028 --> 19:38.596
...do you prefer red or white?

19:40.464 --> 19:42.800
Red.

19:42.834 --> 19:44.902
A bottle of the Brunello,
please.

19:47.404 --> 19:50.708
So, D, what do you do?

19:52.509 --> 19:53.310
What do I do?

19:53.343 --> 19:54.679
Yes.

19:54.712 --> 19:55.947
If you're not sure,
you can always just make it up.

19:55.980 --> 19:58.750
I won't know the difference.

19:58.783 --> 20:00.785
Hmm, I'm a musician.

20:00.818 --> 20:02.352
What do you play?

20:02.385 --> 20:04.321
I play a bunch of instruments.

20:04.354 --> 20:05.422
I used to be in bands,

20:05.455 --> 20:07.959
but now I'm working
on my own thing, or trying to.

20:07.992 --> 20:09.761
So...

20:09.794 --> 20:13.296
- Is that all you do?
- No.

20:13.330 --> 20:15.066
But I just moved to the city.

20:15.099 --> 20:16.500
Well, I guess a year ago.

20:16.533 --> 20:17.501
So, um, yeah.

20:17.534 --> 20:18.535
So, you have a part-time job.

20:18.569 --> 20:19.536
Yes.

20:19.570 --> 20:21.338
Several.

20:21.371 --> 20:22.807
And this.

20:22.840 --> 20:23.507
Sorry?

20:23.540 --> 20:27.779
You do this, what we're doing.

20:27.812 --> 20:29.479
You get paid for your time.

20:31.082 --> 20:32.984
Get this out of the way.

20:33.017 --> 20:34.051
It's all right.
Take a look.

20:34.085 --> 20:35.686
$300 for dinner.

20:40.091 --> 20:42.325
Thanks.

20:42.359 --> 20:46.429
It's important to know
and assert your value

20:46.463 --> 20:50.467
when you're selling
an intangible commodity.

20:50.500 --> 20:53.671
But I'm sure
you understand that, as a...

20:53.704 --> 20:55.305
starving artist.

21:00.778 --> 21:02.814
Um, can I get an order
of the beef carpaccio,

21:02.847 --> 21:04.782
the steak tartar,
a burger medium with blue cheese

21:04.816 --> 21:05.650
and a basket of bread.

21:05.683 --> 21:06.818
And can you bring hot sauce,
please?

21:06.851 --> 21:08.653
Thanks.

21:16.994 --> 21:18.729
I will have the same.

21:24.635 --> 21:26.103
Cheers.

21:29.574 --> 21:30.575
Mmm.

21:32.409 --> 21:34.912
Holy shit fuck.

21:34.946 --> 21:36.948
This burger...

21:36.981 --> 21:39.917
Ah, there she is.

21:39.951 --> 21:41.652
I'm so sorry.

21:41.686 --> 21:43.054
I tried to be a lady for, like,
an hour,

21:43.087 --> 21:45.623
but, fuck me, this burger...

21:45.656 --> 21:47.091
So, what kind of music
do you write?

21:47.124 --> 21:47.825
What?

21:47.859 --> 21:49.459
Oh.

21:49.492 --> 21:50.661
Good question.

21:50.695 --> 21:53.496
Sorry.
Do people not ask that anymore?

21:53.530 --> 21:55.166
I just don't know right now.

21:55.199 --> 21:59.136
I uh, wrote a bunch
of shitty break-up songs.

21:59.170 --> 22:01.538
Seemed so important at the time,
but now I'm kinda over it.

22:01.572 --> 22:03.107
Well,
I'm sure they weren't shitty.

22:03.140 --> 22:04.407
Who was the lucky guy?

22:04.441 --> 22:05.542
He wasn't lucky.

22:05.576 --> 22:06.644
We were together
since high school

22:06.677 --> 22:09.580
and he moved her with me
so I could pursue my music,

22:09.614 --> 22:11.749
switched universities
and everything.

22:11.782 --> 22:13.117
And then?

22:13.150 --> 22:14.719
And then, I wasn't in love
with him anymore

22:14.752 --> 22:16.519
and I tried desperately
to make myself

22:16.554 --> 22:18.022
fall back in love with him
but I couldn't

22:18.055 --> 22:19.557
and I didn't have the guts
to break up with him.

22:19.590 --> 22:21.592
So I just acted like
a righteous cunt

22:21.626 --> 22:23.493
until he broke up with me.

22:23.526 --> 22:26.463
Oh, dear.

22:26.496 --> 22:28.699
Wow. So fucked and completely
selfish and awful,

22:28.733 --> 22:31.135
and I don't know
why I'm telling you all this.

22:31.168 --> 22:33.905
You couldn't be with someone
who didn't feel the same way

22:33.938 --> 22:36.707
about their passion as you did.

22:36.741 --> 22:38.576
I get it.

22:38.609 --> 22:40.077
You wouldn't sacrifice
you're career for anyone,

22:40.111 --> 22:41.879
so how could you be attracted
to someone who would?

22:45.149 --> 22:46.984
So, is that
what happened to you?

22:47.018 --> 22:48.653
How do you mean?

22:48.686 --> 22:51.722
Your wife didn't understand
your dedication to your career

22:51.756 --> 22:53.456
or something,
so she didn't understand you?

22:58.863 --> 22:59.764
Sure.

23:02.566 --> 23:05.202
A bit less romantic.

23:05.236 --> 23:07.504
Dedicate your life to the arts,
you're a legend.

23:07.537 --> 23:09.573
You dedicate your life
to business, you're just a...

23:11.208 --> 23:15.545
Well, you're an old man one way
or another.

23:17.648 --> 23:19.050
Wow.

23:19.083 --> 23:20.251
That blows, Gordy.

23:22.053 --> 23:25.189
Yeah.

23:25.222 --> 23:27.191
You know, you're never too old
to throw your life away

23:27.224 --> 23:31.595
to the arts and become a legend,
though, um...

23:31.629 --> 23:33.164
you're pretty fucking old.

23:33.197 --> 23:35.933
You're very funny.

23:35.967 --> 23:38.669
You're gonna get old, too,
you know?

23:38.703 --> 23:39.870
I guarantee it.

23:41.272 --> 23:42.907
I got some time.

23:42.940 --> 23:45.076
No, you don't.

23:45.109 --> 23:47.578
If you've got something to do,
you'd better do it.

23:47.611 --> 23:49.080
Stop being funny about it.

24:01.258 --> 24:02.259
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

24:02.293 --> 24:03.661
Darren!

24:03.694 --> 24:05.663
- Hi!
- Yay!

24:05.696 --> 24:07.565
- Hey, girl.
- I made it.

24:07.598 --> 24:09.100
What the hell?
You're not wearing sweatpants?

24:09.133 --> 24:10.533
Everyone, it happened.

24:10.568 --> 24:12.036
Danny, shut up.
Doesn't matter.

24:12.069 --> 24:13.037
Where were you, though?

24:13.070 --> 24:14.805
Uh, a funeral.

24:14.839 --> 24:16.607
- Well, I'm an asshole.
- Yep.

24:16.640 --> 24:18.541
It's the motherfuckin' outlaw!

24:18.576 --> 24:19.276
What?

24:19.310 --> 24:20.778
Sorry, I told them.

24:20.811 --> 24:22.747
Wait, whoa.
Told everyone what?

24:22.780 --> 24:23.981
Well, if you were listening,

24:24.015 --> 24:26.584
Darren got fired from catering
for stealing.

24:26.617 --> 24:27.385
It's pretty epic.

24:27.418 --> 24:29.086
Whoo! Hold up, hold up.

24:29.120 --> 24:30.554
Wait.
What did you steal?

24:30.588 --> 24:31.455
Food.

24:31.489 --> 24:32.923
Ooh, you can work here with us.

24:32.957 --> 24:34.258
We don't sell food, so...

24:34.291 --> 24:35.893
You don't.

24:35.926 --> 24:36.894
You sell booze though,
which is a bigger problem.

24:36.927 --> 24:37.795
We sell booze.

24:37.828 --> 24:39.697
Um... do you want
the manager's number?

24:39.730 --> 24:41.665
- 'Cause I could get it for you.
- Yeah.

24:41.699 --> 24:43.134
But you actually
have to call him.

24:43.167 --> 24:44.101
I will.

24:44.135 --> 24:45.803
'Cause if you don't,
I'll look like an idiot.

24:45.836 --> 24:46.904
- Call him now.
- I'll fucking call them.

24:46.937 --> 24:47.838
Okay, I'll call him.

24:47.872 --> 24:49.874
Yo, yo, yo.
What's up?

24:49.907 --> 24:51.709
Everyone,
this is my buddy Angus.

24:51.742 --> 24:53.044
- Everybody.
- Who invited this guy?

24:53.077 --> 24:54.011
Nice haircut.

24:54.045 --> 24:54.945
Who invited me?
What do you mean?

24:54.979 --> 24:56.814
You two should chat,
while I go do drugs.

24:56.847 --> 24:57.948
Yeah, you're already excused.

24:57.982 --> 24:58.816
Yeah.

24:58.849 --> 24:59.984
- Hey.
- How you doing?

25:00.017 --> 25:00.918
Good.

25:00.951 --> 25:02.586
What's new?

25:02.620 --> 25:03.854
Weren't you supposed
to send me a demo,

25:03.888 --> 25:04.789
like, a year ago or something?

25:04.822 --> 25:07.658
Yeah. I've just been,
like, real busy...

25:07.691 --> 25:08.959
working on stuff.

25:08.993 --> 25:09.927
Hold that for a second.
Hey.

25:09.960 --> 25:11.262
Thank you. Whiskey.

25:11.295 --> 25:12.363
You know me well.

25:12.396 --> 25:13.197
Look at that, huh?

25:13.230 --> 25:13.998
Thank you.

25:14.031 --> 25:15.666
Of course, no problem.

27:45.983 --> 27:48.485
Hi, Jim.
It's D.

27:48.519 --> 27:49.420
Yeah, we met the other night.

27:49.453 --> 27:50.487
I'm just...

27:52.089 --> 27:53.891
Uh-huh.

27:55.459 --> 27:56.460
Yeah.

28:05.202 --> 28:06.270
Where...

28:09.907 --> 28:11.208
Wait.

28:11.242 --> 28:12.376
Where's the...

29:00.891 --> 29:01.925
Yo.

29:01.959 --> 29:03.527
Hey, what's going on?

29:03.561 --> 29:06.263
Um... Is cash okay?

29:06.297 --> 29:07.231
Yeah, yeah.

29:07.264 --> 29:08.932
Let's see what we got here.

29:20.477 --> 29:22.580
Can I try that?

29:22.614 --> 29:24.148
Do you know how to play that?

29:24.181 --> 29:25.249
No.

29:25.282 --> 29:27.017
Well, good luck.

29:27.051 --> 29:29.153
It's not the...
it's not the easiest instrument

29:29.186 --> 29:30.555
in the world to play.

29:30.588 --> 29:32.890
I mean, people practice that
for years

29:32.923 --> 29:35.492
before they move up
to that kind of thing.

29:35.526 --> 29:36.427
Oh, yeah?

29:36.460 --> 29:37.394
Yeah.

29:37.428 --> 29:38.395
Huh.

29:55.112 --> 29:56.246
So, when are you
gonna play a gig already?

29:56.280 --> 29:58.015
My undergrads are asking.

29:58.048 --> 29:59.083
I get street cred
when I mention

29:59.116 --> 30:01.452
my alternative lifestyle,

30:01.485 --> 30:02.386
living with a musician.

30:02.419 --> 30:03.320
Oh, yeah?

30:03.354 --> 30:04.288
Hm.

30:06.123 --> 30:09.126
What's the, um...

30:10.928 --> 30:12.597
What?

30:12.630 --> 30:16.066
Is that what?
Be... Be-ow-ow-ow...

30:16.100 --> 30:17.234
Oh, fuck.

30:17.267 --> 30:18.369
Oh, I'm so sorry.

30:18.402 --> 30:21.372
I forget that you sleep, like,
regular person hours.

30:21.405 --> 30:23.540
I, um...

30:23.575 --> 30:25.943
I bought a pedal steel.

30:25.976 --> 30:30.147
It's probably a dumb idea,
but it sounds, like, um...

30:30.180 --> 30:31.281
...it sounds like a soprano.

30:31.315 --> 30:31.982
You know?

30:32.015 --> 30:34.218
It's like a...
it's like...

30:48.399 --> 30:51.201
- Like a woman's vibrato.
- Oh...

30:51.235 --> 30:55.406
Special, but I can't make it do
that yet, so...

30:55.439 --> 30:56.340
Sorry to keep you up.

30:56.373 --> 30:57.441
Sounds awesome.

30:57.474 --> 30:59.443
And you weren't...
keeping me up.

31:02.379 --> 31:03.981
To be honest, I probably
wouldn't be able to sleep

31:04.014 --> 31:05.182
if you weren't singing.

31:15.025 --> 31:16.126
Aww, Pete...

31:17.528 --> 31:18.929
That's so sweet.

32:03.373 --> 32:04.742
You look tired.

32:04.776 --> 32:06.176
Hmm. Probably.

32:06.210 --> 32:07.612
Someone keeping you up?

32:07.645 --> 32:08.613
What? No.

32:08.646 --> 32:10.547
Just haven't been up this early
in a while.

32:10.582 --> 32:12.282
I work nights now, you know?

32:12.316 --> 32:13.785
Oh, I see.
You had another date.

32:13.818 --> 32:14.485
Of course, you've got others.

32:14.518 --> 32:16.053
- No, no, no.
- You don't?

32:16.086 --> 32:18.288
No, I, uh...

32:18.322 --> 32:20.224
No, I was just up
all-night writing.

32:20.257 --> 32:22.059
Excuse me, Mr. Pierce?

32:26.564 --> 32:28.633
- Thank you.
- That's great.

32:28.666 --> 32:30.300
Ah.
Hey, Bob, how are you?

32:30.334 --> 32:32.503
Hey, good to have you.

33:08.573 --> 33:10.507
Shit...

33:10.541 --> 33:11.776
Excuse me.

33:11.809 --> 33:13.210
Do you have a phone charger?

33:13.243 --> 33:15.647
Uh, no, but you could make ask
the DJ.

33:15.680 --> 33:16.748
That's a good idea.

33:19.416 --> 33:22.386
Wait a minute, ae you,
uh, Mary Kessel's daughter?

33:22.419 --> 33:23.420
No.

33:23.453 --> 33:24.254
Oh.

33:24.288 --> 33:27.859
You just...
you look just like her.

33:27.892 --> 33:29.627
So, who are you here with?

33:29.661 --> 33:31.428
Uh, Gordon Pierce.

33:31.461 --> 33:33.565
Ah.

33:33.598 --> 33:36.333
That's lovely.

33:36.366 --> 33:37.702
Who are you here with?

33:37.735 --> 33:38.870
How do you mean?

33:38.903 --> 33:39.771
Like, are you here
with someone?

33:39.804 --> 33:41.873
Why? Do I need to be here
with someone?

33:41.906 --> 33:43.307
You think that
I don't have millions of dollars

33:43.340 --> 33:46.209
they want me to donate?

33:46.243 --> 33:48.780
You... you asked me
the same question.

33:48.813 --> 33:50.447
I'm just fucking with you.

33:53.183 --> 33:54.251
DJ?

33:55.720 --> 33:57.187
Okay.

34:03.427 --> 34:04.829
I'm so sorry
for leaving you alone

34:04.862 --> 34:05.897
for all of this.

34:05.930 --> 34:08.298
I did want to introduce you
to a friend of mine

34:08.332 --> 34:09.767
in the music industry.

34:09.801 --> 34:13.170
Nancy, Bill, this is D.

34:13.203 --> 34:14.839
Another articling student?

34:14.872 --> 34:16.774
I'm surprised you let her out
of the office before midnight.

34:16.808 --> 34:18.610
No, no, no.
D is a musician.

34:18.643 --> 34:19.844
Ah.

34:19.877 --> 34:21.613
And what kind of music
do you play?

34:21.646 --> 34:23.748
Um...

34:23.781 --> 34:27.484
I-I play, like... I guess
I used to play pretty simple,

34:27.517 --> 34:28.720
like, singer-songwriter stuff,

34:28.753 --> 34:31.689
but I'm working on
something more, um...

34:31.723 --> 34:32.657
Well, it's kind of hard
to talk about.

34:32.690 --> 34:34.659
Uh...

34:34.692 --> 34:36.326
It's like kind of experimental,

34:36.360 --> 34:38.362
but I guess
that's not really right.

34:40.632 --> 34:42.567
D has an
absolutely stunning voice.

34:42.600 --> 34:43.668
Ah.

34:43.701 --> 34:45.168
Nice.

34:45.202 --> 34:47.270
Well, as long as it sounds
better than this shit.

34:47.304 --> 34:48.706
- Good Lord.
- Hey, stop it.

35:10.227 --> 35:11.461
<i>Hey, honey.
Hi.</i>

35:11.495 --> 35:15.767
<i>It's midnight,
which means it's your birthday.</i>

35:15.800 --> 35:17.635
<i>Um...</i>

35:17.669 --> 35:19.236
<i>happy birthday.</i>

35:19.269 --> 35:24.408
<i>I miss you, and...
Oh, I don't know.</i>

35:24.441 --> 35:27.979
<i>Why don't you give me a call
when you wake up tomorrow?</i>

35:28.012 --> 35:29.781
<i>Yeah.</i>

35:29.814 --> 35:31.983
<i>Night-night.</i>

35:32.016 --> 35:32.984
What is this?!

35:33.017 --> 35:35.452
It's a... pearl tie!

35:37.254 --> 35:38.790
Happy birthday, Darren!

35:38.823 --> 35:40.658
Let me see.

35:40.692 --> 35:43.226
Anyways, so I had to fucking die
in the scene

35:43.260 --> 35:45.262
because the next scene
was my funeral,

35:45.295 --> 35:47.932
and I could hear them offstage,
searching for the gun,

35:47.965 --> 35:50.534
and I kinda panic,
so I'm like...

35:51.602 --> 35:52.436
...and then, they're like,
"Bang, bang, bang!"

35:52.469 --> 35:54.772
and they yelled "bang"
from offstage.

35:54.806 --> 35:56.273
I fucking almost shit myself.

35:56.306 --> 35:57.141
She died of fear!

35:57.175 --> 35:58.308
- Oh my God!
- Abandon ship, Darren!

35:58.341 --> 36:00.410
Abandon ship!

36:00.444 --> 36:01.913
She's fine, she's fine.
Just leave her.

36:01.946 --> 36:04.281
She's fine.

36:04.314 --> 36:06.316
I'm so bummed
that we missed that show.

36:06.349 --> 36:08.385
What are you working on now?

36:08.418 --> 36:11.488
Well, I'm doing this show
that tours universities

36:11.521 --> 36:13.290
and deals with stresses
of first year,

36:13.323 --> 36:14.992
and I'm playing a student
and I want to kill myself, so.

36:15.026 --> 36:16.694
Very serious first year stress.

36:16.728 --> 36:17.729
Which universities?

36:17.762 --> 36:20.698
Peter's doing his PhD at U of T
in architecture.

36:20.732 --> 36:22.299
Ooh!

36:22.332 --> 36:23.433
That's not even close.

36:23.467 --> 36:24.769
Sustainable urban planning.

36:24.802 --> 36:26.003
That's kind of boring.

36:26.037 --> 36:27.705
That is much less exciting.

36:27.739 --> 36:28.973
- Wow.
- No, no.

36:29.006 --> 36:31.475
All my students think
I'm a harmless nerd.

36:31.508 --> 36:33.878
That's why he tells them
that he's dating a musician.

36:33.911 --> 36:35.479
Uh, no, I don't.

36:35.512 --> 36:36.346
Yeah, you do.
Come on.

36:36.379 --> 36:37.882
I don't tell my students
we're dating.

36:37.915 --> 36:39.516
Oh. Okay, jeez.

36:39.549 --> 36:40.785
Sorry.

36:40.818 --> 36:43.386
Darren, did you ever
message my boss about the job?

36:43.420 --> 36:46.356
I said you'd reach out.

36:46.389 --> 36:47.925
No.

36:47.959 --> 36:48.860
So,
where are you working right now?

36:48.893 --> 36:52.597
'Cause I think I've had it
with Chef Dan.

36:52.630 --> 36:54.832
I'm just, uh, focusing
on my music at the moment.

36:54.866 --> 36:56.366
Yeah, but how are you
making money?

36:56.399 --> 36:57.668
She's an entrepreneur.

36:57.702 --> 36:58.636
What? Really?

36:58.669 --> 37:00.303
No, he's just being funny.

37:00.337 --> 37:01.739
No. I mean,
that's kind of what you do.

37:01.773 --> 37:02.907
Peter...

37:02.940 --> 37:04.675
Are you a drug dealer?

37:04.709 --> 37:06.010
I have been resisting the urge
to do that

37:06.043 --> 37:06.978
for a very long time now.

37:07.011 --> 37:08.079
As if...

37:08.112 --> 37:09.781
Girls can't be drug dealers.

37:09.814 --> 37:10.982
Excuse you.

37:11.015 --> 37:12.784
Maybe she's a lady
of the night.

37:12.817 --> 37:14.585
Darren, you'd make a
terrible hooker, just saying.

37:14.619 --> 37:16.587
- Oh, thanks.
- Well..

37:16.621 --> 37:19.590
Well...

37:19.624 --> 37:20.958
Well what?

37:20.992 --> 37:22.526
Peter, I'm not...
I'm not a fucking hooker.

37:22.560 --> 37:24.695
What the fuck?

37:24.729 --> 37:26.329
What do you do?

37:26.363 --> 37:31.368
Uh, I don't even...
he's... he's... um, okay.

37:31.401 --> 37:33.671
There is a...

37:33.704 --> 37:38.609
There's this, like, website,
where rich dudes set up dates

37:38.643 --> 37:41.344
with women
and they pay you to-

37:41.378 --> 37:42.713
I get paid to go on a date.

37:45.716 --> 37:47.018
Shut the fuck up.

37:47.051 --> 37:48.518
That's kinda cool.

37:48.553 --> 37:49.620
Yeah.

37:49.654 --> 37:52.723
So, you're like a prostitute.

37:52.757 --> 37:54.424
Whoa.

37:54.457 --> 37:55.793
No, I'm not.

37:55.827 --> 37:57.829
Well, a guy's paying you
for a sexual service,

37:57.862 --> 37:59.462
that's prostitution.

37:59.496 --> 38:01.431
It's not like a...
it's not a sexual service.

38:01.464 --> 38:02.633
That's a bit extreme.

38:02.667 --> 38:04.836
Yeah, but that's what he
wants, ultimately.

38:04.869 --> 38:05.837
That's what he's thinking.

38:05.870 --> 38:06.871
You're a sexual commodity.

38:06.904 --> 38:07.839
Okay, hold up.

38:07.872 --> 38:09.506
What do you wear on the date?

38:09.539 --> 38:10.641
Very good question.

38:10.675 --> 38:13.410
Clothes. I mean, I wear clothes,
just regular clothes.

38:13.443 --> 38:14.511
You don't dress like
that, do you?

38:14.544 --> 38:15.680
Nope.

38:15.713 --> 38:16.948
Okay, well, what if they try to,
like, make a move on you,

38:16.981 --> 38:18.149
what do you do then?

38:18.182 --> 38:19.150
Why do you want to know so bad?

38:19.183 --> 38:21.152
I just, like, you set up
everything beforehand

38:21.185 --> 38:23.120
and I'm just getting paid
to sit across

38:23.154 --> 38:24.055
from dudes at dinner.

38:24.088 --> 38:24.956
And it gives me time
to work on my music.

38:24.989 --> 38:27.725
Yeah, some things
are just not worth it.

38:27.758 --> 38:29.459
Not worth it?
What the fuck does that mean?

38:29.492 --> 38:32.697
Okay, if you want to set women
back 50 years, go ahead.

38:32.730 --> 38:34.665
Angela...

38:34.699 --> 38:36.767
What is your problem
with prostitution, Angela?

38:36.801 --> 38:37.568
That's the bigger question.

38:37.602 --> 38:39.502
Okay, you guys think that

38:39.536 --> 38:41.772
all prostitutes
are super-empowered,

38:41.806 --> 38:44.976
open, free-thinking,
hipster feminists?

38:45.009 --> 38:48.445
Not like it perpetuates
the idea of women as property.

38:48.478 --> 38:50.748
A woman is free to do
what she wants with her body.

38:50.781 --> 38:52.449
Okay, would you do it?

38:52.482 --> 38:54.752
Instead of children's theatre
or catering?

38:54.785 --> 38:56.821
What?
Get paid to be manhandled,

38:56.854 --> 38:59.657
look cute and get my ass
smacked a couple times a night?

38:59.690 --> 39:00.791
Yeah, I already do it.

39:00.825 --> 39:02.660
It's called catering
and literally every fucking job

39:02.693 --> 39:03.594
that I've ever had.

39:03.628 --> 39:04.494
Thank you.

39:04.527 --> 39:05.096
Yeah, it's different, though.

39:05.129 --> 39:05.963
That's sexual harassment.

39:05.997 --> 39:08.531
You can report that
to your managers.

39:08.566 --> 39:09.934
Yeah, no.
I got shit to do.

39:09.967 --> 39:12.003
Well, it's not exactly
the same thing, so...

39:12.036 --> 39:13.170
Did you do it?

39:13.204 --> 39:13.771
What?

39:13.804 --> 39:15.606
Did you report your boss?

39:15.640 --> 39:16.240
Wait, what?

39:16.274 --> 39:17.275
Okay, Darren...

39:17.308 --> 39:20.443
...do you, like, you know,
declare your income?

39:20.477 --> 39:22.146
'Cause I feel like tax evasion...

39:22.179 --> 39:23.681
Why do you keep talking
about this like

39:23.714 --> 39:24.715
it's a real thing?

39:24.749 --> 39:25.816
Well, I don't know.
I'd sign up.

39:25.850 --> 39:28.085
- I would do it.
- No.

39:28.119 --> 39:29.353
"No."

39:29.387 --> 39:30.922
Why would I want my girlfriend
going on dates with other dudes?

39:30.955 --> 39:31.889
I think it's pretty simple.

39:31.923 --> 39:32.924
I mean, it's just dinners.

39:32.957 --> 39:34.959
You'd be sitting across
from someone all night

39:34.992 --> 39:36.227
who wants to fuck you.

39:36.260 --> 39:38.896
What the fuck is that
my problem what he's thinking?

39:38.930 --> 39:40.231
Slash, newsflash, buddy...

39:40.264 --> 39:41.666
The guy who pours
your girlfriend's coffee

39:41.699 --> 39:42.767
wants to fuck her.

39:42.800 --> 39:45.870
Oh, no, I can't look you
in the eye, Mr. Barista Man,

39:45.903 --> 39:47.638
because my boyfriend pissed
on my leg.

39:47.672 --> 39:48.940
Wait.
What?

39:48.973 --> 39:50.473
You're making me sound
like I'm some sorta fucked up

39:50.507 --> 39:51.642
jealous boyfriend and I'm not.

39:51.676 --> 39:52.276
Are you sure, though?

39:52.310 --> 39:53.377
Thousand percent.

39:53.411 --> 39:54.412
Hey-hey, let's just talk
about something else, guys.

39:54.444 --> 39:56.647
I would not want my boyfriend
going on a date

39:56.681 --> 39:58.481
with some girl
who wants to sleep with him.

39:58.515 --> 39:59.383
- I get it.
- Uh, no.

39:59.417 --> 40:02.820
It is not same exchange rate,
Angela.

40:02.853 --> 40:04.822
You don't want Kyle
hanging around some chick

40:04.855 --> 40:05.690
who wants to fuck him,

40:05.723 --> 40:08.793
because you think
Kyle is gonna cheat.

40:08.826 --> 40:11.528
Danny doesn't want Maya
sitting across from a guy

40:11.562 --> 40:12.964
who bought her dinner,
not 'cause he thinks

40:12.997 --> 40:15.099
that Maya's gonna cheat,
but because he knows

40:15.132 --> 40:16.968
that makes her that
guy's property for the night

40:17.001 --> 40:18.235
instead of his.

40:18.269 --> 40:21.205
Which is why women who engage
in this stuff perpetuate the...

40:21.238 --> 40:22.773
So, now, it's our fault.

40:22.807 --> 40:24.642
You don't have to go
on a paid date with a dude

40:24.675 --> 40:27.712
to feel pressure that
when a guy buys you dinner,

40:27.745 --> 40:29.246
you have to give them
something back sexual,

40:29.280 --> 40:30.614
plain and simple.

40:30.648 --> 40:31.983
Yeah, it's the blow away.

40:32.016 --> 40:33.684
Oh my gosh, here we go again.

40:33.718 --> 40:35.186
- It's the what?
- This, this right here.

40:35.219 --> 40:36.687
It's the blowjob that
you give a guy

40:36.721 --> 40:38.856
to make him go away.

40:38.889 --> 40:40.791
You know, it's like
he's back at your place,

40:40.825 --> 40:42.960
he's bought you dinner,
you don't want to fuck him,

40:42.994 --> 40:44.762
but you also don't want to hurt
his precious ego

40:44.795 --> 40:46.063
by asking him to leave

40:46.097 --> 40:48.766
or maybe he actually
just won't leave.

40:48.799 --> 40:50.067
So, you're like, "Okay, fine.

40:50.101 --> 40:55.106
"I'll just, like,
blow you away."

40:55.139 --> 40:56.173
That can't be a real thing.

40:56.207 --> 41:00.011
Yeah,
and women don't fake orgasms.

41:00.044 --> 41:01.145
You never answered my question.

41:01.178 --> 41:03.147
Would you do it?

41:03.180 --> 41:04.081
Don't ask me that question.

41:04.115 --> 41:05.683
Why not?

41:05.716 --> 41:07.084
Because I'd probably
get murdered.

41:10.087 --> 41:12.857
Chicks from the rez don't
survive that line of work...

41:12.890 --> 41:14.524
dummy.

41:19.864 --> 41:22.266
Well, why do you do it, Darren?

41:23.701 --> 41:25.002
Why?

41:25.036 --> 41:26.971
Yeah. Why do you do it,
instead of,

41:27.004 --> 41:29.073
like, a restaurant job
or whatever?

41:30.674 --> 41:33.677
I don't know!
Like, um...

41:33.711 --> 41:35.046
it pays better.

41:35.079 --> 41:36.180
Is that, like, a solid answer?

41:36.213 --> 41:38.682
It pays better and it's, like...

41:38.716 --> 41:40.217
It's like, fucking clear.

41:40.251 --> 41:42.319
I don't need to, like,
wonder at what I'm worth

41:42.353 --> 41:43.687
or be underpaid for it.

41:43.721 --> 41:44.989
They pay me and then I know.

41:45.022 --> 41:46.924
And sometimes, like,
if I dress better,

41:46.957 --> 41:48.092
then they pay me better.

41:48.125 --> 41:49.193
And sometimes it's sort of fun,

41:49.226 --> 41:50.594
and sometimes
it's fucking weird,

41:50.628 --> 41:51.762
but at least I know
where I stand.

41:51.796 --> 41:52.997
You know?
Like..

41:58.402 --> 42:00.738
Look, I know you want to work
on your music and everything...

42:00.771 --> 42:02.306
Why the fuck do you keep
bringing up my music?

42:02.339 --> 42:03.240
What the fuck do you know?

42:03.274 --> 42:05.176
You're dating
Mr. Trust Fund Baby here.

42:05.209 --> 42:06.110
- Hey!
- No!

42:06.143 --> 42:06.944
You wanna talk about this?

42:06.977 --> 42:07.812
Let's talk about it.

42:07.845 --> 42:09.246
Who the fuck pays
for your lifestyle?

42:09.280 --> 42:10.848
We're a couple,
that's different.

42:10.881 --> 42:11.649
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah, yeah?

42:11.682 --> 42:13.184
You're really dating Kyle
for Kyle?

42:13.217 --> 42:14.919
- No offence, Kyle.
- Offence taken!

42:14.952 --> 42:16.754
You wanna get
all self-righteous, Angela,

42:16.787 --> 42:19.290
at least admit that living
for free at a super big,

42:19.323 --> 42:21.692
Queen Street loft
is pretty fucking sweet.

42:21.725 --> 42:23.160
- That's none of your business.
- Oh, yeah?

42:23.194 --> 42:24.862
But do you always have sex
with him

42:24.895 --> 42:27.698
'cause you really want to
or sometimes, just sometimes,

42:27.731 --> 42:29.200
do you kind of feel like
you have to pay rent?

42:33.370 --> 42:34.805
Good luck with
your fucking music.

42:34.839 --> 42:35.706
- Yeah, no problem.
- Jesus, Darren.

42:35.739 --> 42:37.108
What?

42:37.141 --> 42:38.709
Well, if you're gonna get
fucked by the man,

42:38.742 --> 42:39.777
you might as well get paid
for it.

42:39.810 --> 42:41.879
I'm not...
I'm not fucking anybody!

42:41.912 --> 42:43.948
I'm not fucking anybody.

42:43.981 --> 42:46.050
What the fuck is your problem,
dude?

42:46.083 --> 42:47.017
You never said it was a secret.

42:47.051 --> 42:48.152
Are you fucked?

42:48.185 --> 42:49.320
Don't ya think that shows
how you really feel about it

42:49.353 --> 42:50.287
if you don't want people
to know?

42:50.321 --> 42:51.889
It's nobody's business!

42:51.922 --> 42:52.857
Yeah, but they're
your free-thinking,

42:52.890 --> 42:54.125
super open artist friends.

42:54.158 --> 42:55.192
They'd understand.

42:55.226 --> 42:57.094
I'm just your boring roommate
you feel obligated

42:57.128 --> 42:58.129
to invite to things.

42:58.162 --> 42:59.797
You're my closest friend, Peter.

42:59.830 --> 43:01.765
But you certainly
didn't act like it tonight.

43:01.799 --> 43:03.300
Come on. Yeah, maybe I don't
want to be your closest friend.

43:05.469 --> 43:06.403
Fuck.
Peter, you're-

43:06.437 --> 43:09.740
I'm what?
In the friend zone?

43:09.773 --> 43:11.442
What?

43:11.475 --> 43:12.743
- Never mind.
- No, no, no, no, no.

43:12.776 --> 43:14.044
What do you mean?

43:14.078 --> 43:15.446
Oh, come on, Darren.
Don't play dumb.

43:15.479 --> 43:17.681
- I know what it means, but...
- But what?

43:17.715 --> 43:18.916
You want to keep ignoring it
because it suggests

43:18.949 --> 43:21.452
that I have feelings for you
and you just want to be friends?

43:21.485 --> 43:22.286
Okay.

43:22.319 --> 43:23.954
Oh, don't act so surprised.

43:23.988 --> 43:25.256
You ignore it on purpose,
right?

43:25.289 --> 43:26.857
You ignore a lot on purpose.

43:26.891 --> 43:29.059
No, I don't!

43:29.093 --> 43:30.828
Did you or did you not know
I had feelings for you?

43:35.933 --> 43:36.800
- I...
- Well, I do

43:36.834 --> 43:38.068
and you know it
and everyone else thinks

43:38.102 --> 43:39.336
I'm in the fucking friend zone...

43:39.370 --> 43:41.305
Stop saying that stupid thing
that you picked up on campus!

43:41.338 --> 43:42.740
...utterly pathetic thing.

43:42.773 --> 43:44.208
I do everything for you
and you just use me

43:44.241 --> 43:45.009
when you want to.

43:45.042 --> 43:46.710
I don't use you, Peter.

43:46.744 --> 43:47.745
I don't... I don't use you.

43:47.778 --> 43:49.313
Yes, you do!

43:49.346 --> 43:51.782
Darren, and what's worse is
you know you do.

43:51.815 --> 43:54.084
I'm your roadie, your groupie,
when you want it,

43:54.118 --> 43:55.920
and the rest of the time,
it's these perverted old dudes

43:55.953 --> 43:59.123
that you dress up for
and spend time with.

43:59.156 --> 44:02.459
I'm there for you
all the fucking time

44:02.493 --> 44:04.028
and, in return, what do I get?

44:07.398 --> 44:09.133
You get to be my friend.

44:10.901 --> 44:11.735
Yeah.

44:14.371 --> 44:18.042
I'm sorry,
but is that not enough?

44:20.511 --> 44:21.478
No, I just...

44:21.512 --> 44:22.780
Oh, hold on, hold on, hold on.

44:22.813 --> 44:25.049
Hold on, Peter.

44:25.082 --> 44:26.951
Do I owe you a fuck?

44:26.984 --> 44:28.185
Is that how this works?

44:28.219 --> 44:29.486
Am I supposed to sit
on your dick,

44:29.520 --> 44:32.189
because you've been
a good friend to me, Peter?

44:32.223 --> 44:33.257
- Night.
- Oh, no, no.

44:33.290 --> 44:34.391
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

44:34.425 --> 44:35.326

No, isn't this what you wanted
for so long, Peter?

44:41.298 --> 44:42.166
Don't.

44:42.199 --> 44:43.300
Isn't this what you wanted
for so long?

44:46.537 --> 44:48.138
- Isn't this what you wanted...

59:49.206 --> 59:51.041

59:51.075 --> 59:52.009

59:52.042 --> 59:52.810
Yeah, I can hear it.

59:52.843 --> 59:54.712
All right.

59:55.813 --> 59:56.747

Yo, yo, yo.
That's tight. that's...

1:01:13.490 --> 1:01:14.491
Hello, Darren.

1:01:14.525 --> 1:01:17.428
Nice to see you again.

1:01:17.461 --> 1:01:19.296
Yeah, you too.

1:01:35.879 --> 1:01:37.248
Darren?

1:01:37.281 --> 1:01:41.252
Why don't you sing
some of your own music?

1:01:41.285 --> 1:01:42.920
I'd love to hear it.

1:01:42.953 --> 1:01:44.288
Like my own stuff?

1:01:44.321 --> 1:01:45.489
Whatever you like.

1:01:45.522 --> 1:01:48.959
I... I usually sing with, like,
instrumentation and stuff.

1:01:48.993 --> 1:01:50.361
- Like, it's a whole...
- Whatever you'd like.

1:01:50.394 --> 1:01:51.395
But it's like a whole thing.

1:01:51.428 --> 1:01:53.230
You got a whole
audience here, girl.

1:01:53.264 --> 1:01:55.466
Sing us a song.

1:01:55.499 --> 1:01:56.867
Okay.

1:02:04.141 --> 1:02:04.975
Just one sec.

1:02:05.009 --> 1:02:06.043
I, uh...

1:02:10.981 --> 1:02:15.386
♪ You got way too warm to wear,
St. John ♪

1:02:17.354 --> 1:02:21.091
♪ And I got way too hot
to care, St. John ♪

1:02:21.125 --> 1:02:22.860
Sing something else.

1:02:55.259 --> 1:02:58.429
Darren, take a seat.

1:03:07.338 --> 1:03:08.640
Great voice.

1:03:08.673 --> 1:03:10.908
I can certainly hear
your training.

1:03:10.941 --> 1:03:12.209
But you're relying on it.

1:03:15.546 --> 1:03:19.383
You're being safe, Darren,
'cause you want to do it right,

1:03:19.416 --> 1:03:21.452
but all anyone ever
really cares about is

1:03:21.485 --> 1:03:25.657
how far you're willing
to take it to do it wrong.

1:03:25.690 --> 1:03:27.057
Does that make sense?

1:03:31.161 --> 1:03:32.529
Is this how you really dress?

1:03:35.232 --> 1:03:37.401
- Sorry?
- Is this you?

1:03:43.540 --> 1:03:45.209
I won't be the only person
to ask you this question,

1:03:45.242 --> 1:03:46.977
by the way.

1:03:47.010 --> 1:03:47.911
Okay.

1:03:53.317 --> 1:03:54.985
So is Jeffrey here still?

1:03:55.018 --> 1:03:56.987
Just went to grab food.

1:03:57.020 --> 1:03:58.556
I mean, like,
will he be in touch with Angus

1:03:58.590 --> 1:04:00.391
- if there's a...
- Who?

1:04:00.424 --> 1:04:02.259
The guy.
The other guy here.

1:04:02.292 --> 1:04:03.927
Jeffrey will be in touch
with him?

1:04:08.198 --> 1:04:12.169
Okay.

1:04:12.202 --> 1:04:14.238
This is me,
the head of this label,

1:04:14.271 --> 1:04:17.174
being in touch with you
right now, Darren.

1:04:17.207 --> 1:04:18.308
Do you your homework.

1:04:18.342 --> 1:04:20.043
Jeffrey is our A&R scout,

1:04:20.077 --> 1:04:21.679
but if his approval makes
you feel better,

1:04:21.713 --> 1:04:22.980
by all means, go, go find him.

1:04:23.013 --> 1:04:24.649
Go.

1:04:24.682 --> 1:04:26.150
And Angus.

1:04:26.183 --> 1:04:27.585
Angus wants to fuck you.

1:04:27.619 --> 1:04:29.253
What?

1:04:29.286 --> 1:04:31.054
No it's not like...
it's not like that.

1:04:31.088 --> 1:04:32.690
It's always like that, Darren.

1:04:32.724 --> 1:04:34.458
You should know this.

1:04:45.269 --> 1:04:46.336
Listen to me.
I'm telling you this

1:04:46.370 --> 1:04:49.574
because I think you're talented,
okay?

1:04:49.607 --> 1:04:51.375
But you're not ready.

1:04:59.717 --> 1:05:01.285
Thank you for coming in.

1:05:06.223 --> 1:05:07.991
Cool.

1:05:10.127 --> 1:05:13.096
We ended up
going to the Lakeview?

1:05:13.130 --> 1:05:15.299
And... hey,
you want some stir-fry?

1:05:15.332 --> 1:05:16.099
No.

1:05:16.133 --> 1:05:17.334
It's actually not that bad.

1:05:17.367 --> 1:05:18.135
Peter made it.

1:05:20.772 --> 1:05:27.612
Uh, Peter and I had the most
awkward drunken sex last night.

1:05:27.645 --> 1:05:29.546
- What?
- Yeah.

1:05:29.581 --> 1:05:30.715
That chick went home and then,

1:05:30.748 --> 1:05:32.249
like, we ended up staying up
watching...

1:05:32.282 --> 1:05:34.451
- You had sex with Peter!?
- Yeah.

1:05:34.485 --> 1:05:36.353
I mean, you told me
you never had a thing for him.

1:05:36.386 --> 1:05:37.622
Why the fuck would you do that?!

1:05:37.655 --> 1:05:39.189
Holy shit!
Fuck!

1:05:39.223 --> 1:05:39.891
What the fuck is wrong
with you!!

1:05:39.924 --> 1:05:42.226
Hey!
Did you fuck my sister?!

1:05:42.259 --> 1:05:43.327
- Darren!
- Um...

1:05:43.360 --> 1:05:46.296
Did you fuck my sister
when she was drunk as fuck!?

1:05:46.330 --> 1:05:47.498
- We were both drunk.
- You perverted, sick...

1:05:47.531 --> 1:05:48.532
Darren, stop!

1:05:48.566 --> 1:05:49.701
My little sister comes to town,

1:05:49.734 --> 1:05:52.804
who I'm supposed to stop
from doing dumb shit and then...

1:05:52.837 --> 1:05:54.639
Yeah, well, I don't know
that you're the best person-to-be...

1:05:54.672 --> 1:05:55.640
What!?

1:05:55.673 --> 1:05:57.007
Well,
as far as role models go...

1:05:57.040 --> 1:06:00.143
You had sex with my sister
when she was fucking wasted!

1:06:00.177 --> 1:06:03.080
Oh, calm down.

1:06:03.113 --> 1:06:04.081
Can't you just...

1:06:04.114 --> 1:06:05.415
Okay.
You guys are...

1:06:05.449 --> 1:06:06.450
Fuck!

1:06:06.483 --> 1:06:08.085
Darren!

1:06:10.420 --> 1:06:13.524
Darren?

1:06:13.558 --> 1:06:15.593
Hey!
Are you free?!

1:06:21.633 --> 1:06:23.166
Wow.

1:06:28.539 --> 1:06:30.474
You look...

1:06:30.507 --> 1:06:31.776
- Nice.
- Oh, right, yeah.

1:06:31.809 --> 1:06:35.546
Sorry, I didn't have the energy
to get all dolled up for you.

1:06:35.580 --> 1:06:37.114
Oh, you never have to do that
on my account.

1:06:37.147 --> 1:06:38.148
You know what?

1:06:38.181 --> 1:06:40.317
I'm gonna go.

1:06:40.350 --> 1:06:41.251
No, it's all right,
it's all right.

1:06:41.285 --> 1:06:43.788
The young lady did not have
a nice day.

1:06:43.821 --> 1:06:46.256
No. The young lady did not have
a nice day!

1:06:46.290 --> 1:06:48.726
I had a meeting
at a record label.

1:06:48.760 --> 1:06:50.193
And your friend, Nancy?

1:06:50.227 --> 1:06:51.528
Yeah, well, she runs it
and I'm pretty sure

1:06:51.563 --> 1:06:52.797
she told everyone
I'm a prostitute.

1:06:52.830 --> 1:06:56.166
So there goes that.

1:06:56.199 --> 1:06:58.836
Well...

1:06:58.870 --> 1:07:00.605
Maybe she's right,
maybe I'm not...

1:07:02.707 --> 1:07:04.474
What does she think?
I'm an escort?

1:07:04.508 --> 1:07:06.678
I told her you were my friend.

1:07:06.711 --> 1:07:07.579
Which is true.

1:07:07.612 --> 1:07:09.146
That's it?
That's what you tell people?

1:07:09.179 --> 1:07:11.415
Yes.

1:07:11.448 --> 1:07:14.886
People tend not to question me
on what I'm doing.

1:07:14.919 --> 1:07:15.820
All right.

1:07:19.256 --> 1:07:20.625
Why do you pay to go on a date
with a girl

1:07:20.658 --> 1:07:22.760
40 years younger than you?

1:07:22.794 --> 1:07:24.428
I've worked very hard
my whole life.

1:07:24.461 --> 1:07:27.699
I like nice things.

1:07:27.732 --> 1:07:30.835
And sitting across from
a beautiful woman at dinner...

1:07:30.868 --> 1:07:33.771
is a very nice thing.

1:07:33.805 --> 1:07:35.773
I'm a nice thing?

1:07:35.807 --> 1:07:38.710
People pay for far
more complicated things.

1:07:38.743 --> 1:07:41.244
A personal trainer to teach you
how to do physical activity,

1:07:41.278 --> 1:07:43.280
a nanny to raise your kids,
an investor to take your money,

1:07:43.313 --> 1:07:44.247
then give it back to you in...

1:07:44.281 --> 1:07:45.783
Stop, okay.
Yeah, yeah. Stop.

1:07:45.817 --> 1:07:48.385
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.

1:07:48.418 --> 1:07:50.187
Maybe this is why people
don't ask you questions, Gordy,

1:07:50.220 --> 1:07:52.255
'cause you don't really
answer them.

1:07:52.289 --> 1:07:54.659
Why do you do it?

1:07:54.692 --> 1:07:56.694
I'm a starving artist.

1:08:00.530 --> 1:08:03.400
I don't have like, a fuckin'
fancy answer like you.

1:08:03.433 --> 1:08:04.301
It's not complicated.

1:08:04.334 --> 1:08:05.369
Or it wasn't supposed to be.

1:08:05.402 --> 1:08:07.572
Then that woman today was...

1:08:07.605 --> 1:08:09.841
God, I mean,
if you had a daughter,

1:08:09.874 --> 1:08:11.809
would you tell her
not to do this?

1:08:11.843 --> 1:08:13.510
- This?
- This! This arrangement thing!

1:08:13.543 --> 1:08:14.946
If you had a daughter,
how would you feel about her

1:08:14.979 --> 1:08:16.513
doing what I'm doing?

1:08:20.450 --> 1:08:21.719
I do have a daughter.

1:08:23.955 --> 1:08:25.222
You do?

1:08:25.255 --> 1:08:26.557
Yes.

1:08:29.761 --> 1:08:30.828
How old is she?

1:08:30.862 --> 1:08:32.496
How old are you?

1:08:32.529 --> 1:08:33.931
Twenty-five.

1:08:38.903 --> 1:08:40.705
You have a daughter
that's my age?

1:08:42.940 --> 1:08:45.542
She's...

1:08:45.576 --> 1:08:47.612
in and around your age.

1:08:52.016 --> 1:08:54.251
So what would you tell her?

1:09:01.258 --> 1:09:02.960
We don't talk.

1:09:10.434 --> 1:09:14.538
What are we drinking, hm?

1:09:17.441 --> 1:09:18.676
It's like a...

1:09:18.710 --> 1:09:21.411
like, a classical
music competition

1:09:21.445 --> 1:09:22.580
that I used to do as a kid.

1:09:22.613 --> 1:09:23.681
I always fuckin' won.

would like, split.

1:10:48.099 --> 1:10:50.467
And somehow
I could think about,

1:10:50.500 --> 1:10:52.770
like, how well I was doing,

1:10:52.804 --> 1:10:56.941

an annoying stage mom

1:11:05.082 --> 1:11:05.950
or anything.

1:11:05.983 --> 1:11:09.352
She... let me do my own thing
but, fuck,

1:11:09.386 --> 1:11:11.789
I was such a piece of work.

1:11:11.823 --> 1:11:13.658

Okay, Darren.

1:11:32.710 --> 1:11:36.848
Tell me how I am "fucked up,"
as you say.

1:11:41.484 --> 1:11:42.587
No, no, no.

1:11:42.620 --> 1:11:43.588
Nope.

1:11:43.621 --> 1:11:46.657
No.
Nope.

1:11:46.691 --> 1:11:50.027
How about...

1:11:50.061 --> 1:11:51.829
How about you tell me?

1:11:58.102 --> 1:12:00.470
Hmm.

1:12:07.578 --> 1:12:08.679
Okay.

1:12:08.713 --> 1:12:10.748
It's okay.

1:12:13.150 --> 1:12:16.988
It's hard, I get it.

1:12:25.930 --> 1:12:29.734
What was I saying about Kiwanis?

1:12:29.767 --> 1:12:32.169
How your mind would split.

1:12:32.203 --> 1:12:33.503
Oh right.

1:12:33.536 --> 1:12:35.673
Yeah, that was the best part!

1:12:35.706 --> 1:12:37.675
Yeah, so I'm on stage.

1:12:37.708 --> 1:12:40.011
My mind would just, like, split.

1:12:40.044 --> 1:12:42.947
- Oh!
- Oh, shit!

1:12:42.980 --> 1:12:44.115
Oh, fuck.

1:12:44.148 --> 1:12:47.685
Oh, don't do that!

1:13:57.822 --> 1:13:59.590
Are you hungry?

1:13:59.623 --> 1:14:03.627
I normally skip breakfast.

1:14:03.661 --> 1:14:06.797
And I have to be at a meeting,
actually.

1:14:06.831 --> 1:14:09.532
Louisa is coming
in half an hour.

1:14:11.302 --> 1:14:12.570
Louisa?

1:14:12.603 --> 1:14:15.106
Louisa, my house cleaner.

1:14:15.139 --> 1:14:17.008
Oh.

1:14:17.041 --> 1:14:18.042
In half an hour.

1:14:18.075 --> 1:14:19.176
Oh!

1:15:27.378 --> 1:15:28.946
What is this?

1:15:31.282 --> 1:15:32.616
It's for you.

1:15:36.687 --> 1:15:37.922
What for?

1:15:43.694 --> 1:15:46.097
You know you need it.

1:15:46.130 --> 1:15:48.132
I've been meaning
to give it to you.

1:15:53.704 --> 1:15:55.773
You've been meaning
to give it to me?

1:16:01.112 --> 1:16:06.150
Darren, you deserve it.

1:16:25.302 --> 1:16:27.238
Did you like my singing?

1:16:30.141 --> 1:16:32.409
Mm-hm, oh yes.

1:16:34.411 --> 1:16:36.247
Very pretty.

1:17:36.240 --> 1:17:37.975
So I'll see you this summer?

1:17:40.911 --> 1:17:43.247
Are you going to tell me
what's going on with you?

1:17:45.416 --> 1:17:46.917
Nothing.

1:17:57.962 --> 1:18:00.197
How about you come visit me
next time?

1:18:02.499 --> 1:18:04.735
And call Mom, asshole.

1:18:11.576 --> 1:18:14.912
Oh, look who it is!

1:18:14.945 --> 1:18:16.814
What's happening?

1:18:16.847 --> 1:18:19.783
Look who's here.

1:18:19.817 --> 1:18:22.353
Been trying to call you
for like... oh, thanks.

1:18:22.386 --> 1:18:23.787
Like a couple days.

1:18:23.821 --> 1:18:24.922
Oh, yeah?

1:18:24.955 --> 1:18:26.257
Cool.

1:18:26.290 --> 1:18:28.859
That's weird.

1:18:28.892 --> 1:18:30.394
Where's, um...

1:18:30.427 --> 1:18:32.429
Is, uh, Jeffrey here?

1:18:32.463 --> 1:18:36.166
What, you got a thing for him?

1:18:36.200 --> 1:18:37.569
Hey, pass me a beer, man?

1:18:37.602 --> 1:18:38.603
Thank you very much.

1:18:38.637 --> 1:18:40.237
No, I just wanted to know
if he had any feedback

1:18:40.271 --> 1:18:41.505
from the other day, you know?
Like...

1:18:41.538 --> 1:18:42.239
Yeah, that's probably
pretty good.

1:18:42.273 --> 1:18:43.974
- Uh...
- What did you think?

1:18:44.008 --> 1:18:46.243
It was good, yeah.
Uh, you guys, is it...

1:18:46.277 --> 1:18:47.811
That guy we were talking about.
Was it Tim?

1:18:47.845 --> 1:18:48.912
Pfft,
what are you talking about?

1:18:48.946 --> 1:18:51.482
Honestly, I can't remember.
It starts with a "T."

1:18:51.515 --> 1:18:52.584
It's like a Tim.
Taylor, something like that.

1:18:52.617 --> 1:18:58.122
You know that chick, Nancy?
She was fucking intense.

1:18:58.155 --> 1:18:59.256
Yeah, hey,
you want to go inside

1:18:59.290 --> 1:19:00.324
and get a beer or something?

1:19:00.357 --> 1:19:02.226
No, can I actually just talk
to you for a second?

1:19:06.163 --> 1:19:07.998
What's up?

1:19:08.032 --> 1:19:09.500
I don't know,
I just wanted to know, you know,

1:19:09.533 --> 1:19:10.901
what you thought about
the track that I worked on,

1:19:10.934 --> 1:19:11.902
and what the next steps are.

1:19:11.935 --> 1:19:15.839
Obviously, I...
I'd love to work with you, so...

1:19:15.873 --> 1:19:19.009
Yeah, I don't think
they're gonna use those vocals.

1:19:19.043 --> 1:19:20.244
Why?

1:19:20.277 --> 1:19:22.279
I don't know.

1:19:22.313 --> 1:19:24.381
But I... you know,
I'm swamped with a bunch

1:19:24.415 --> 1:19:25.349
of other bands right now,
Darren.

1:19:25.382 --> 1:19:27.451
So...

1:19:27.484 --> 1:19:30.254
please don't get weird about it.

1:19:30.287 --> 1:19:32.256
I mean, you're still a babe!

1:19:34.124 --> 1:19:37.127
So it is driving me
fucking nuts.

1:19:37.161 --> 1:19:38.228
Okay.

1:19:38.262 --> 1:19:39.930
It's not... it's Tim!

1:20:04.154 --> 1:20:07.191
Can I talk to you for a second?

1:20:07.224 --> 1:20:10.027
Uh, Nancy,
Bill, you know Darren.

1:20:10.060 --> 1:20:11.128
Why don't you join us?
Grab a seat?

1:20:11.161 --> 1:20:12.196
No.

1:20:12.229 --> 1:20:13.297
I don't want to sit down.

1:20:13.330 --> 1:20:14.398
I want to talk to you
for a second,

1:20:14.431 --> 1:20:15.399
I don't want to fuckin' wine
and dine.

1:20:15.432 --> 1:20:17.368
Can we just go somewhere
and talk for a second?

1:20:17.401 --> 1:20:18.603
I'm sorry to fuck up
your dinner.

1:20:18.636 --> 1:20:20.904
Okay.

1:20:20.938 --> 1:20:23.374
Would you guys just excuse me
for a moment?

1:20:26.043 --> 1:20:26.977
Why did you give me that thing?

1:20:27.010 --> 1:20:28.178
Darren!

1:20:31.281 --> 1:20:33.016
Was it 'cause we fucked?

1:20:36.153 --> 1:20:38.656
Or do you actually think
I'm, like, worth something?

1:20:38.690 --> 1:20:39.591
Fuck!

1:20:41.959 --> 1:20:43.927
I just wanna know how you feel.

1:20:43.961 --> 1:20:45.429
Come on!

1:20:52.970 --> 1:20:54.572
I just wanna know how you feel!

1:20:58.208 --> 1:20:59.644
If you give me that,
I'll give you back...

1:20:59.677 --> 1:21:01.044
Darren.

1:21:05.015 --> 1:21:06.917
Goodnight.

1:21:20.497 --> 1:21:22.399
Cool.

1:21:22.433 --> 1:21:24.435
A little
misunderstanding obviously.

1:21:24.468 --> 1:21:26.203
She clearly
understands a lot of things.

1:21:48.626 --> 1:21:50.762
What?
What are you doing?

1:21:50.795 --> 1:21:52.262
- What is this?
- First and last!

1:21:54.498 --> 1:21:56.033
How did you...

1:22:44.515 --> 1:22:45.750
Hmm.

1:22:59.096 --> 1:23:00.798
Yo!

1:23:12.810 --> 1:23:14.411
Yo!

1:23:19.817 --> 1:23:21.285
What are you doing here?

1:23:21.318 --> 1:23:22.419
Why aren't you
answering your phone?

1:23:22.452 --> 1:23:23.320
Why are you here?!

1:23:23.353 --> 1:23:24.589
Why am I here?!

1:23:24.622 --> 1:23:26.558
You've been ignoring Mom
for a month!

1:23:26.591 --> 1:23:29.359
She made me call Peter,
which was super awkward,

1:23:29.393 --> 1:23:30.795
and he said that
you don't live there anymore.

1:23:30.828 --> 1:23:33.731
So, obviously she thinks
you're in a gutter somewhere.

1:23:33.765 --> 1:23:35.465
So she sent me here to check
on you.

1:23:35.499 --> 1:23:38.302
You can tell Mom I'm fine.

1:23:38.335 --> 1:23:39.202
Are you sure about that?

1:23:39.236 --> 1:23:40.437
Dude.

1:23:40.470 --> 1:23:41.673
This is not a good time,
all right?

1:23:41.706 --> 1:23:43.206
So...

1:23:52.249 --> 1:23:53.550
What are you doing with these?

1:23:55.853 --> 1:23:57.321
What?

1:23:57.354 --> 1:23:58.856
Dad's records.

1:24:07.899 --> 1:24:11.435
Listen,
you have a good weekend, but, uh...

1:24:11.468 --> 1:24:12.837
I don't wanna hang.

1:24:23.681 --> 1:24:25.617
You always give him
so much credit.

1:24:29.453 --> 1:24:30.420
He didn't leave these for you.

1:24:30.454 --> 1:24:32.222
He forgot them.

1:24:37.494 --> 1:24:39.697
You don't know
what you're talking about.

1:24:39.731 --> 1:24:42.532
You act like he's the reason
you're a musician.

1:24:45.535 --> 1:24:47.304
But he's not.

1:24:49.641 --> 1:24:52.509
And now you're a dick
to the one person

1:24:52.542 --> 1:24:54.579
who's always been there.

1:25:13.931 --> 1:25:15.365
Hey, Mom.

1:25:18.301 --> 1:25:19.503
Are you ready?

1:25:22.840 --> 1:25:24.207
Yeah.
