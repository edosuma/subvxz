00:00.125 --> 00:02.333
The Chimdale Stakes
is the first jewel

00:02.417 --> 00:04.417
in the Triple Crown
of dog racing.

00:04.500 --> 00:07.083
And this year's race
is sure to be a thriller,

00:07.166 --> 00:09.875
pitting wily veterans
like Bark Ruffalo

00:09.959 --> 00:12.709
against exciting
newcomers like Fleabiscuit,

00:12.792 --> 00:15.250
a long shot at 20-1 odds.

00:15.333 --> 00:19.083
Can any of these dogs
win all three races?

00:19.166 --> 00:22.166
History is against them, as no
dog has won the Triple Crown

00:22.250 --> 00:25.083
since some dog did it in 1943.

00:25.166 --> 00:27.458
His name was Some Dog.

00:27.542 --> 00:29.208
I know that sounds strange...

00:29.291 --> 00:31.250
was the dog
that came in second.

00:31.333 --> 00:32.959
Perhaps it's
the confusing names

00:33.041 --> 00:35.625
as to why dog racing
never took off elsewhere...

00:35.709 --> 00:38.125
came in third.

00:38.208 --> 00:40.458
Babe, can you believe this?

00:40.542 --> 00:41.834
I'm so nervous.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.542
Of course you're nervous.

00:43.625 --> 00:46.125
Everything you've done
has led you to this.

00:46.208 --> 00:47.667
Sunday, buying the dog.

00:47.750 --> 00:49.417
Monday, entering the race.

00:49.500 --> 00:51.542
Tuesday, kind of
taking the day off.

00:51.625 --> 00:52.667
Wednesday, too.

00:52.750 --> 00:54.083
And now it's Thursday!

00:54.166 --> 00:55.667
Yeah, it's Thursday!

00:55.750 --> 00:57.083
It's almost the weekend!

00:57.166 --> 00:58.542
What am I so nervous about?

00:58.625 --> 01:00.458
It's normal.
It's the big race.

01:00.542 --> 01:01.917
Oh, God!
Is it happening now?!

01:02.000 --> 01:04.041
This means so much to me!

01:04.125 --> 01:08.166
Up next, the 83rd

So much tradition and history
and -- Oh, look!

01:54.458 --> 01:55.917
A guy pukin' his guts out!

01:56.000 --> 01:57.417
This place is so fancy.

01:57.500 --> 01:59.291
They even have
their own signature drink.

01:59.375 --> 02:01.083
It's called a "brass monkey."

02:01.166 --> 02:03.458
It's half a 40
with orange juice.

02:03.542 --> 02:06.083
Very smoky.

02:06.166 --> 02:07.917
Maybe it's the cigarette butt
in the bottom.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.083
I'm just glad you guys
came out to support Jeff.

02:10.166 --> 02:12.709
I'm so happy he's found
something he's interested in.

02:12.792 --> 02:14.917
So, I've never been
to a dog track before.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.041
How does this all work?

02:16.125 --> 02:17.583
The dogs race around the course

02:17.667 --> 02:18.959
by chasing after
the rabbit over there.

02:19.041 --> 02:20.750
Its name is Wizbo.

02:20.834 --> 02:22.709
What?!
That's a stuffed rabbit!

02:22.792 --> 02:24.458
Are dogs really that dumb?

02:24.542 --> 02:26.166
It doesn't even have eyes!

02:26.250 --> 02:27.709
Pop a couple raisins
in its head!

02:27.792 --> 02:30.125
Make it look more realistic!

02:30.208 --> 02:32.125
You can complain about this,
Klaus,

02:32.208 --> 02:34.208
or you can be a hero.

02:37.542 --> 02:39.125
The dogs
are in their traps,

02:39.208 --> 02:42.166
and we're ready to go
here at Chimdale Stakes.

02:42.250 --> 02:44.208
It's me, Tuttle, by the way.

02:44.291 --> 02:47.083
If you didn't know my job
before, now you know!

02:47.166 --> 02:49.000
I'm a dog-race announcer.

02:49.083 --> 02:50.709
Another fact about me.

02:50.792 --> 02:53.792
I've yet to form an opinion
about gay marriage.

02:53.875 --> 02:56.250
Hey, Francine!
Who let the dogs out?

02:56.333 --> 02:58.625
I don't know.
The gatekeeper?

03:03.834 --> 03:06.250
There you go, Mr. Wizbo.

03:06.333 --> 03:08.458
You have such pretty eyes now.

03:08.542 --> 03:09.917
And off goes the Wizbo!

03:10.000 --> 03:11.417
Aaah!

03:11.500 --> 03:14.375
And there go the dogs!

03:19.959 --> 03:21.709
Wait!
They can't catch me!

03:21.792 --> 03:24.417
Hey, doggies!
You want this butt?

03:24.500 --> 03:27.250
Come and get it,
you dumb doggies!

03:28.333 --> 03:30.583
So, as we come
into the final bend,

03:30.667 --> 03:32.417
it's Bark Ruffalo with the lead,

03:32.500 --> 03:35.291
with Butt Stuff
creeping in behind him.

03:35.375 --> 03:38.750
And oh! Here comes Fleabiscuit
on the outside!

03:38.834 --> 03:40.500
He's making a run for it!

03:40.583 --> 03:42.375
Oh, my God!
Go, go, go!

03:42.458 --> 03:43.917
You got this, Fleabiscuit!

03:44.000 --> 03:46.834
And now Fleabiscuit is
right on Bark Ruffalo's tail!

03:46.917 --> 03:49.750
Can he do it? It'll be close,
but Fleabiscuit wins!

03:49.834 --> 03:51.000
Fleabiscuit wins!

03:51.083 --> 03:52.917
Wow! What a race!

03:53.000 --> 03:54.959
And finishing last
is Butt Stuff.

03:55.041 --> 03:58.250
A lot of Butt Stuff fans
are gonna be sore tonight.

03:58.333 --> 03:59.834
I can't believe we won!

03:59.917 --> 04:02.041
That was the most incredible
rush I've ever had!

04:02.125 --> 04:03.375
It was better than sex!

04:03.458 --> 04:06.250
-Way!
-And I just won $200.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.709
I'm rich beyond belief.

04:07.792 --> 04:09.583
And that was only
the first race.

04:09.667 --> 04:12.792
We can sit in the sun
all day gambling and drinking.

04:12.875 --> 04:15.625
This is gonna be great for us.

04:15.709 --> 04:17.750
Oh, my God.

04:17.834 --> 04:20.417
That was the most exciting
thing I've ever done.

04:21.542 --> 04:23.834
I lost two raisins,
but that's cool.

04:28.625 --> 04:31.458
This place looks fancy.

04:31.542 --> 04:33.583
I -- I don't know
if they'll let Fleabiscuit in

04:33.667 --> 04:34.750
without a jacket.

04:34.834 --> 04:36.417
Jeff, you won a huge race.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.041
We should have
a nice dinner out.

04:38.125 --> 04:41.083
Oh, I'm sorry, but dogs aren't
allowed in the restaurant.

04:41.166 --> 04:44.333
Excuse me, sir,
but this is Jeff Fisher,

04:44.417 --> 04:47.625
and his better half,
Fleabiscuit.

04:47.709 --> 04:50.166
The winners
of the Chimdale Stakes!

04:50.250 --> 04:52.291
Get them a table right away!

04:52.375 --> 04:53.834
Absolument!

04:53.917 --> 04:55.792
Wow.
Thanks, Mayor Garfield.

04:55.875 --> 04:57.333
Is this your wife?

04:57.417 --> 04:59.166
You know me.
It's Hayley.

04:59.250 --> 05:00.959
We've had many
adventures together.

05:01.041 --> 05:03.625
Yes, yes, but I've erased
all those memories

05:03.709 --> 05:05.834
to make new ones with Jeff!

05:05.917 --> 05:07.792
Now, Jeff, do you mind

05:07.875 --> 05:09.667
if we take
a picture photo together

05:09.750 --> 05:11.917
using my cellphone cam-er-a?

05:12.000 --> 05:13.208
Sure!

05:14.750 --> 05:16.417
Umm...

05:17.709 --> 05:19.291
Oh.

05:19.375 --> 05:22.250

Do you mind moving?

05:26.625 --> 05:28.709
Que haces?
Vete a la cocina!

05:32.417 --> 05:33.792
What a day at the races.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.875
And that streak we went on
after our first win.

05:36.959 --> 05:38.250
Lost nine in a row.

05:38.333 --> 05:41.041
All our money, my cellphone,
and one of your shoes.

05:41.125 --> 05:42.667
As I see it,
we have two options.

05:42.750 --> 05:44.542
We could go home
and face the ridicule

05:44.625 --> 05:46.542
or live here forever.

05:46.625 --> 05:48.709
Let's put it to a shoe vote.

05:48.792 --> 05:50.125
The shoes have it.

05:50.208 --> 05:52.208
Welcome home, baby.

05:56.041 --> 05:59.959
It looks like I have
the house all to myself.

06:00.041 --> 06:04.750
That means I can have
a little naked time.

06:04.834 --> 06:07.458
Now, usually I don't do this,

06:07.542 --> 06:09.959
but I'mma go ahead
and break it off

06:10.041 --> 06:12.750

you're such a good boy,

09:35.000 --> 09:36.625
aren't you, Fleabiscuit?
Good boy!

09:36.709 --> 09:39.041
Oh, you're the best thing
that's ever happened to me!

09:39.125 --> 09:41.792
Oh, yes, and you have
a super-active tongue!

09:41.875 --> 09:43.500
Oh, my!

09:44.959 --> 09:48.875
Okay, so we're gonna head home!

09:51.834 --> 09:54.917
Or just go to the park.

09:55.959 --> 09:57.792
Ugh.
Let's get to work!

09:57.875 --> 09:59.125
Ugh. Fine.

09:59.208 --> 10:00.959
But why does your mouth
taste like beets?

10:01.041 --> 10:02.208
It's 9:00 a.m.

10:02.291 --> 10:04.041
Are you an early-morning
beet eater?

10:04.125 --> 10:06.041
That's insane.
You're insane.

10:06.125 --> 10:07.333
But I'm insane, too.

10:07.417 --> 10:09.500
Insane for that big beet flavor!

Your dog just qualified
for the Langley Derby.

Oh, my God!
Did you hear that, Ryan?

11:38.542 --> 11:40.250
We're going to the derby!

11:42.458 --> 11:45.834
Oh, so you're one
of those dog owners?

11:45.917 --> 11:47.417
I'll let you two
have your privacy.

11:54.625 --> 11:56.542
Francine!
Look what I just stole

11:56.625 --> 11:57.792
from people in the stands!

11:57.875 --> 12:01.083
A Velcro wallet, $13,
and an Invisalign!

12:02.166 --> 12:03.500
See, the beauty of this thing

12:03.583 --> 12:06.000
is that it's impossible
to see that I'm wearing it!

12:06.083 --> 12:08.417
And I pickpocketed
so many tampons,

12:08.500 --> 12:10.417
I can have a period forever!

12:10.500 --> 12:12.667
God, I love living
at the track with you!

12:12.750 --> 12:15.125
Let's do it in the dirt!

12:21.917 --> 12:23.667
Greg Corbin here
with Chimdale Stakes

12:23.750 --> 12:26.125
and Lanceton Downs
champion Fleabiscuit

12:26.208 --> 12:28.291
and his owner
and trainer, Jeff Fisher.

12:28.375 --> 12:29.792
-Hi, Jeff.
-Hi, Gerg!

12:29.875 --> 12:32.250
Jeff, you're one win away
from the Triple Crown.

12:32.333 --> 12:33.834
Tell me, what's your secret?

12:33.917 --> 12:35.667
Oh, well, I kind of
just bring Fleabiscuit

12:35.750 --> 12:37.875
to the track and let him run,
and that's pretty much it.

12:37.959 --> 12:39.500
Well, between you
and your wife, Hayley,

12:39.583 --> 12:41.417
there must be something
in the water here.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.500
That's right.
Wait, Hayley?

12:43.583 --> 12:46.500
Her dog, Ryan, is the newest
entrant in the Langley Derby!

12:46.583 --> 12:48.166
Did you not know?

12:48.250 --> 12:49.417
Oh, my.

12:49.500 --> 12:51.750
Your own wife
competing against you.

12:51.834 --> 12:53.417
Quick, zoom in.
See if we can get tears.

12:53.500 --> 12:55.041
How does that make you feel?

12:57.375 --> 12:59.834
You know there's a zoom function
on the camera, Charlie.

12:59.917 --> 13:01.875
This is my way!

13:03.875 --> 13:05.250
Damn it.
Hayley's home.

13:05.333 --> 13:07.125
But I need a healthy snack.

13:07.208 --> 13:09.875
Looks like I got myself
a naked challenge!

13:11.125 --> 13:12.417
You're racing against me?

13:12.500 --> 13:14.500
So what?
It's not a big deal.

13:14.583 --> 13:15.792
It's a huge deal!

13:15.875 --> 13:17.333
Why would you do this
to me, Hayley?!

13:17.417 --> 13:19.458
I'm one win away
from the Triple Crown!

13:19.542 --> 13:21.542
I know you think
that you're a "big shot" now,

13:21.625 --> 13:23.375
but not everything
is about you, Jeff!

13:23.458 --> 13:25.542
This is the most important race
of my career!

13:25.625 --> 13:27.291
You don't even have a career!

13:27.375 --> 13:28.875
I know what this is about!

13:28.959 --> 13:31.041
I finally found
something I'm good at,

13:31.125 --> 13:32.875
and you're trying
to take it away from me!

13:32.959 --> 13:35.291
What?!
That's crazy.

13:35.375 --> 13:37.000
You're jealous of me,
so you're trying to

13:37.083 --> 13:38.542
horn in on my thing.

13:38.625 --> 13:41.375
Well, sorry to break it to you,
but it's not gonna work.

13:41.458 --> 13:44.166
And why is your brother naked?!

13:44.917 --> 13:47.917
Whoa!

13:48.000 --> 13:51.041
You guys are so high.

13:51.125 --> 13:54.875
You think this is
really happening.

13:59.834 --> 14:01.208
I'm still mad at you.

14:01.291 --> 14:03.166
But I gotta admit,
it's pretty cool

14:03.250 --> 14:06.458
that your brother
draws on his pubic hair.

14:09.041 --> 14:10.542
Roger.

14:10.625 --> 14:13.542
I need you to win the derby.

14:13.625 --> 14:14.667
Mmkay.

14:14.750 --> 14:17.792
I need you to do anything
to beat Fleabiscuit and win.

14:17.875 --> 14:19.208
Do you understand me?

14:19.291 --> 14:20.625
Anything!

14:20.709 --> 14:21.792
Mm-hmm.

14:21.875 --> 14:23.709
Well, I mean, anything except --

14:23.792 --> 14:25.375
Don't kill him or anything.

14:25.458 --> 14:26.875
Hayley, who do you think I am?!

14:26.959 --> 14:28.458
Some kind of
cold-blooded killer?

14:28.542 --> 14:30.417
I'm not a monster!
Geez!

14:30.500 --> 14:31.834
I'm sorry, Roger.

14:31.917 --> 14:33.208
-I-I didn't mean to --
-I'm just kidding.

14:33.291 --> 14:34.583
You were right to clarify.

14:34.667 --> 14:37.250
I would have --
I would have killed him.

14:44.959 --> 14:47.625
And good afternoon
from the Langley Derby!

14:47.709 --> 14:50.792
Today, little Fleabiscuit
goes for the Triple Crown!

14:50.875 --> 14:53.750
Will he have what it takes
to lift that trophy?

14:53.834 --> 14:55.333
Oh, look.
There's a dog on it.

14:55.417 --> 14:56.709
That seems right.

14:56.792 --> 14:59.000
And here come the competitors!

14:59.083 --> 15:00.750
There's Hot Chunks!

15:00.834 --> 15:03.583
Turtle Face!
Cheesecake Is My Enemy!

15:03.667 --> 15:05.166
-Ryan!
-Are we all good?

15:05.250 --> 15:06.250
Took care of it.

15:06.333 --> 15:08.583
And last but certainly
not least,

15:08.667 --> 15:12.250
the champion and heavy favorite,
Fleabiscuit!

15:18.750 --> 15:21.333
Fleabiscuit,
are you all right, boy?

15:21.417 --> 15:22.875
What'd you do, poison him?

15:22.959 --> 15:24.625
God, no, I just slept
with his girlfriend

15:24.709 --> 15:26.333
and showed him the video.

15:26.417 --> 15:28.333
What do you think, huh?

15:28.417 --> 15:31.375
Oh, shoot. I wanted to
show you the one with music.

15:37.417 --> 15:39.166
Good dog.

15:39.250 --> 15:41.000
Now let's win this thing.

15:41.083 --> 15:42.375
Great card today.

15:42.458 --> 15:45.125
Even though Ryan's a roughie,
I want him across the board.

15:45.208 --> 15:47.667
How much you wanna wager?

15:47.750 --> 15:50.458
Three cough drops
and, uh, six Altoids.

15:50.542 --> 15:53.166
If you don't have money,
then you can't place bets here.

15:53.250 --> 15:54.458
What, is the Langley Derby

15:54.542 --> 15:57.583
too good for
a Burger King coupon?

15:57.667 --> 15:59.667
Why didn't
you say so, sir?

15:59.750 --> 16:02.458
Right this way to
the BK Royalty Lounge!

16:04.166 --> 16:06.834
Oh, my gosh.
I should straighten up.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.166
You're old.

16:13.250 --> 16:14.709
You're ugly.

16:14.792 --> 16:16.709
You smell like Funyuns.

16:16.792 --> 16:18.875
Your girlfriend's a slut.

16:18.959 --> 16:21.417
Actually, the Funyun smell's
coming from you.

16:21.500 --> 16:25.375
I'm sorry, dog number 3!
I hope you win!

16:26.500 --> 16:27.792
Who am I?

16:27.875 --> 16:30.834
I'm the Wizbo, bitch.

16:30.917 --> 16:34.625
So! Will Fleabiscuit
make history today?

16:34.709 --> 16:37.500
Do historians even
follow dog racing?

16:37.583 --> 16:39.667
All these questions
will be answered

16:39.750 --> 16:43.875
at the Langley Derby Racetrack

16:43.959 --> 16:46.625

16:52.750 --> 16:54.375
Oh, my.

16:54.458 --> 16:56.750
It looks like the pressure's
gotten to little Fleabiscuit.

16:56.834 --> 16:58.125
He's barely running.

16:58.208 --> 16:59.959
Fleabiscuit, what's wrong?

17:00.041 --> 17:02.500
And out to an early lead
is Ryan.

17:03.875 --> 17:06.208
Let's go, Ryan!
Yeah!

17:06.291 --> 17:07.875
Who's the dog now?

17:07.959 --> 17:10.709
And starting to stretch

Wait. I don't want things
to be different.

17:38.333 --> 17:40.917
I don't understand.
I thought I was good at this.

And it's Ryan
around the final bend.

You're so weird-looking.
