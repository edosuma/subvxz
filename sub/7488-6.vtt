00:15.432 --> 00:17.616
How was that?

00:17.617 --> 00:19.749
Well, you got all the notes,

00:19.750 --> 00:22.738
just not in the right order
or in the right key.

00:22.739 --> 00:25.439
- Thanks!
- Yeah.

00:25.709 --> 00:28.444
Ally, Nelson, quick. We
need you off the piano.

00:28.445 --> 00:32.715
Put your hands in the air and
back away from the baby grand.

00:32.716 --> 00:35.910
Guys, what did I tell you
about bringing food in the...

00:35.911 --> 00:38.371
Ugh... Store?

00:39.130 --> 00:41.510
- Yes!
- Awesome!

00:41.511 --> 00:46.489
That was way better than
smashing peanuts in my laptop.

00:46.490 --> 00:49.795
All right, Nelson. Lesson's over.
You can go wash up.

00:49.796 --> 00:52.436
I'm melon man!

00:54.432 --> 00:58.812
Guess who got a job
at Megaphone World?

00:59.237 --> 01:01.097
Who?

01:02.218 --> 01:06.309
And more importantly, guess who got
an exciting piece of mail for...

01:06.310 --> 01:09.010
Mr. Austin Moon?

01:10.614 --> 01:13.163
What's it say? What's it say?

01:13.164 --> 01:17.938
I've been selected to take part in
a study on male pattern baldness?

01:17.939 --> 01:20.190
Sorry. Wrong letter.

01:20.191 --> 01:24.194
I never knew you were bald.
Killer toupee.

01:24.195 --> 01:26.115
Dude!

01:26.854 --> 01:29.314
Here you go.

01:31.321 --> 01:35.244
Whoa! I've been invited to the
Miami Internet Music Awards?

01:35.245 --> 01:36.429
Oh ho!

01:36.430 --> 01:39.326
The rapper Shiny Money wants
me to perform with him.

01:39.327 --> 01:42.679
I convinced him to sample your
song "Double Take" in his new rap.

01:42.680 --> 01:45.327
Look at you, Trish,
manager of the year.

01:45.328 --> 01:48.314
It was easy. All I had to do
was stand outside his house

01:48.315 --> 01:52.988
doing this until he agreed
to watch Austin's video.

01:52.989 --> 01:54.793
Oh, I hate that sound.

01:54.794 --> 01:58.154
Oh, well, in that case...

01:59.462 --> 02:03.072
I can't believe one of my songs
is gonna be on an award show.

02:03.073 --> 02:06.326
I can't believe Austin's singing
with Shiny Money. He's my favorite.

02:06.327 --> 02:12.147
I hope he'll sign the picture
of him I keep in my wallet.

02:17.336 --> 02:19.230
Who cares about autographs?

02:19.231 --> 02:24.151
I can't wait to break
out my red carpet walk.

02:25.179 --> 02:30.147
You call that a red carpet walk?
Check this out.

02:30.148 --> 02:31.805
Uh.

02:31.806 --> 02:33.666
Woo!

02:34.672 --> 02:40.572
Step aside, rookies. Let, uh, Ally D.
Show you how it's done.

02:50.435 --> 02:52.949
The four of us are gonna
have the best night ever.

02:52.950 --> 02:54.358
I know, and look...

02:54.359 --> 02:56.515
I get access to an
exclusive after party...

02:56.516 --> 02:57.566
Yay!

02:57.567 --> 02:59.086
A complimentary gift bag...

02:59.087 --> 03:00.122
Yay!

03:00.123 --> 03:01.890
And an extra ticket
for one guest!

03:01.891 --> 03:03.394
Yay!

03:03.395 --> 03:05.315
What?

03:05.696 --> 03:08.097
I only get one extra
ticket to the show.

03:08.098 --> 03:12.766
I've never been good at math, but one
ticket times three friends is...

03:12.767 --> 03:14.515
Carry the four.

03:14.516 --> 03:16.685
It means only one
of us gets to go.

03:16.686 --> 03:19.326
Huh. I got 47.

03:25.355 --> 03:28.457
<i>When the crowd wants more,
I bring on the thunder.</i>

03:28.458 --> 03:31.592
<i>'Cause you've got my back,
and I'm not going under.</i>

03:31.593 --> 03:33.124
<i>You're my point,
you're my guard.</i>

03:33.125 --> 03:34.743
<i>You're the perfect chord.</i>

03:34.744 --> 03:37.788
<i>And I see our names together
on every billboard.</i>

03:37.789 --> 03:40.847
<i>We're headed for the top,
we've got it on lock.</i>

03:40.848 --> 03:42.461
<i>We'll make 'em say "hey!"</i>

03:42.462 --> 03:44.784
<i>And we'll keep rockin'.</i>

03:44.785 --> 03:48.922
<i>Oh, there's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

03:48.923 --> 03:51.958
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

03:51.959 --> 03:55.028
<i>It's no fun when
you're doing it solo.</i>

03:55.029 --> 03:58.351
<i>With you it's like, "whoa,".
Yeah, and I know.</i>

03:58.352 --> 04:01.001
<i>I own this dream.</i>

04:01.002 --> 04:04.379
<i>'Cause I got you with me.</i>

04:04.380 --> 04:07.497
<i>There's no way I could
make it without ya.</i>

04:07.498 --> 04:11.758
<i>Do it without ya,
be here without ya.</i>

04:18.591 --> 04:21.153
Wow, Trish, thanks for lunch.

04:21.154 --> 04:24.045
I didn't even know th made
frosted french fries.

04:24.046 --> 04:27.226
They don't. But I do.

04:30.568 --> 04:32.537
This wouldn't have anything
to do with you wanting

04:32.538 --> 04:35.375
to be my guest at the
award show, would it?

04:35.376 --> 04:37.563
Wha-a-at?

04:37.564 --> 04:40.564
Don't be ridiculous.

04:40.912 --> 04:43.979
I want you to know
this isn't about me.

04:43.980 --> 04:45.658
You only get to bring one guest,

04:45.659 --> 04:49.511
so it's a decision you need
to think long and hard about.

04:49.512 --> 04:52.936
- Thanks, I'm glad...
- Enough thinking you're taking me.

04:52.937 --> 04:56.407
It's not that easy. You know
I'm bad at making decisions.

04:56.408 --> 05:00.597
I couldn't even figure out which
sneakers to wear this morning.

05:00.598 --> 05:04.333
Look, you owe me.
I'm your manager.

05:04.334 --> 05:09.074
Without me, you wouldn't
even have this gig.

05:09.115 --> 05:12.381
You're right. You
can come with me.

05:12.382 --> 05:14.416
I'll just have to break
the news to Dez and Ally.

05:14.417 --> 05:19.405
Great. I'm gonna get a job at dress hut
so I can get something new to wear.

05:19.406 --> 05:21.141
What about Megaphone World?

05:21.142 --> 05:24.442
Oh. Ah, I'll just quit.

05:26.148 --> 05:31.488
Oh. It's all the way at the
other end of the mall.

05:31.494 --> 05:34.831
Attention, Megaphone World...
I quit!

05:34.832 --> 05:37.292
Trish, you were fired yesterday.

05:37.293 --> 05:40.773
Please return the megaphone.

05:49.224 --> 05:52.824
Dez, I need to talk to you.

05:53.684 --> 05:55.341
What are you doing?

05:55.342 --> 05:57.587
Practicing my award
show reactions.

05:57.588 --> 05:59.860
You never know when you're
gonna be on camera.

05:59.861 --> 06:04.121
Awesome. I'd better
practice mine too.

06:04.996 --> 06:07.060
They just announced the
video of the year.

06:07.061 --> 06:09.253
Standing ovation!

06:09.254 --> 06:12.854
You're the man! I love you.

06:13.938 --> 06:17.778
- Let's do the wave!
- Oh cool.

06:19.597 --> 06:20.741
Woo!

06:20.742 --> 06:25.782
We're gonna have so much
fun at the award show.

06:26.156 --> 06:27.822
About that.

06:27.823 --> 06:30.494
Listen, Dez, I need to
tell you something.

06:30.495 --> 06:33.079
I've been thinking about
the award show and...

06:33.080 --> 06:36.246
And you're trying to figure out how
to let Ally and Trish down easy.

06:36.247 --> 06:39.364
Just say, "I'm taking Dez. I
like him better than you."

06:39.365 --> 06:42.425
"Stop crying, losers."

06:42.884 --> 06:46.183
How is that letting
them down easy?

06:46.184 --> 06:49.930
If you want, I can tell 'em.
Can I tell 'em?!

06:49.931 --> 06:53.311
Look, Dez, I obviously
wanna take you.

06:53.312 --> 06:56.514
I mean you're not just my video
director, you're my best friend.

06:56.515 --> 07:00.325
Yeah. I've been there for
you through everything.

07:00.326 --> 07:03.754
Remember that time at camp when you
ripped your pants and I gave you mine?

07:03.755 --> 07:06.958
Yeah, you went pant-less
for the rest of summer.

07:06.959 --> 07:10.079
And most of the fall.

07:10.240 --> 07:13.159
Oh, and remember that time we
got stuck in the elevator?

07:13.160 --> 07:17.095
- I gave you my pants then too.
- Yeah.

07:17.096 --> 07:19.356
There was really no
reason to do that.

07:19.357 --> 07:21.720
That's what best
friends are for.

07:21.721 --> 07:27.621
I mean, I can't imagine us not going
to your first award show together.

07:27.925 --> 07:31.815
You're right. I could
never go without you.

07:31.816 --> 07:35.084
I'm just gonna have to tell Trish
and Ally the ticket's yours.

07:35.085 --> 07:39.165
Our first award show!
Awesome sauce!

07:41.544 --> 07:44.484
Here you go, buddy.

07:50.060 --> 07:52.465
Are you sure you want to
play the Sousaphone, Nelson?

07:52.466 --> 07:54.895
It's a really heavy instrument.

07:54.896 --> 07:56.831
It's okay. I'm strong.

07:56.832 --> 07:59.096
Just in case, I'd better
keep holding on to...

07:59.097 --> 08:02.157
- Austin, hey.
- Whoa!

08:04.255 --> 08:06.535
Aw, nartz.

08:07.809 --> 08:11.193
Austin, I'm glad you're here. I
just want to let you know...

08:11.194 --> 08:13.084
I get what you're going through.

08:13.085 --> 08:14.681
Really?

08:14.682 --> 08:17.672
You're growing hair
on your toes too?

08:17.673 --> 08:19.833
Ewe. No.

08:20.430 --> 08:24.439
I meant I understand how tough this
ticket nonsense must be for you.

08:24.440 --> 08:27.433
And the last thing I want
to do is add any pressure.

08:27.434 --> 08:29.934
Just because Shiny Money's
sampling "Double Take"...

08:29.935 --> 08:33.633
A song I wrote... Doesn't
mean you have to take me.

08:33.634 --> 08:36.933
- Really?
- Really really.

08:37.746 --> 08:40.147
Well, great!

08:41.107 --> 08:42.967
Yep.

08:43.275 --> 08:46.156
Greaty great great.

08:46.905 --> 08:48.133
But here's the thing...

08:48.134 --> 08:51.709
Aw, but you said
greaty great great.

08:51.710 --> 08:56.857
If you did wanna take me... And
again, totally cool if you don't...

08:56.858 --> 08:59.240
I need to know sooner
rather than later,

08:59.241 --> 09:00.866
because I already requested
the night off work,

09:00.867 --> 09:02.548
and I need a full day
for dress alterations,

09:02.549 --> 09:05.975
and if we're gonna match my purse to
your tie which I'm assuming we would...

09:05.976 --> 09:08.064
If I give you the ticket,
will you stop talking?

09:08.065 --> 09:10.394
Yes. I would totally
stop talking.

09:10.395 --> 09:13.669
- Because I'd be so excited...
- You can come!

09:13.670 --> 09:15.400
Besides, you're right.

09:15.401 --> 09:18.011
You're my partner.
You deserve to go.

09:18.012 --> 09:21.529
Without your song, I wouldn't even
be performing with Shiny Money.

09:21.530 --> 09:23.629
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

09:23.630 --> 09:25.790
Oh! Yay!

09:26.330 --> 09:28.190
Yay.

09:28.723 --> 09:31.321
Austin, can I ask you something?

09:31.322 --> 09:34.895
I know. Why did I say
yes to everybody?

09:34.896 --> 09:37.383
What was I supposed to do?

09:37.384 --> 09:39.912
They all deserve to go.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.330
I couldn't say no.

09:42.331 --> 09:45.371
No, I was gonna
ask you for help.

09:45.372 --> 09:47.712
I'm stuck!

09:52.685 --> 09:54.889
Don't worry about what happened
with the Sousaphone, Nelson.

09:54.890 --> 09:57.277
All instruments can
be dangerous to play.

09:57.278 --> 10:01.160
Is that why you're
wearing a helmet?

10:01.161 --> 10:05.481
Oh no, this is just
how I play drums.

10:08.901 --> 10:11.541
Whoa ho ho ho!

10:12.282 --> 10:13.688
Thank you, Dez.

10:13.689 --> 10:16.041
No, I'm dizzy from
playing head drums.

10:16.042 --> 10:18.682
Whoa ho ho ho.

10:20.679 --> 10:22.730
What do you think?

10:22.731 --> 10:28.631
Did your dress get a job at the
megaphone store because it is loud!

10:28.697 --> 10:31.339
Some day you're gonna
take off that helmet...

10:31.340 --> 10:34.182
And I'll be waiting.

10:34.183 --> 10:36.490
Why are you all dressed up?

10:36.491 --> 10:39.667
Because I'm going with Austin to
the Miami Internet Music Awards.

10:39.668 --> 10:43.023
No, you're not. Austin
promised me the extra ticket.

10:43.024 --> 10:46.708
Sorry, ladies, you're both wrong.
I'm going to the Music Awards.

10:46.709 --> 10:48.929
Please. You're not
even dressed for it.

10:48.930 --> 10:53.550
Oh, but I am. Exhibit A...
Formal backpack.

10:53.835 --> 10:55.581
Whatever. He's taking me.

10:55.582 --> 10:59.062
- No way.
- He promised me.

10:59.538 --> 11:02.345
I'm not taking any of you.

11:02.346 --> 11:05.471
I'm not taking any of you
because I'm not going.

11:05.472 --> 11:07.615
What are you talking about?

11:07.616 --> 11:11.635
I messed up. I promised all of
you you could come with me.

11:11.636 --> 11:13.495
Why would you do that?

11:13.496 --> 11:16.324
Because you gave me
frosted french fries...

11:16.325 --> 11:19.588
And Dez gave me his
pants and Ally...

11:19.589 --> 11:22.675
Talked for a really long time.

11:22.676 --> 11:25.460
I don't talk for a
really long time.

11:25.461 --> 11:28.343
I think I talk for a
normal amount of time.

11:28.344 --> 11:30.691
I mean, then again, what is
the definition of normal?

11:30.692 --> 11:32.416
Your normal could be
different from my normal

11:32.417 --> 11:34.078
which could be different
from Trish's normal.

11:34.079 --> 11:37.052
And uh, you were saying?

11:37.053 --> 11:40.238
I'm gonna call Shiny Money and
tell him I can't perform.

11:40.239 --> 11:42.230
This night is about all of us.

11:42.231 --> 11:46.210
If we all can't be there,
none of us should.

11:46.211 --> 11:47.975
Wow.

11:47.976 --> 11:50.751
Of all the selfish
things I've ever heard!

11:50.752 --> 11:54.553
And after all I've done for you, I can't
believe this is how you thank your manager.

11:54.554 --> 11:57.084
Yeah. And this is how
you thank your partner?

11:57.085 --> 12:00.155
- This is my moment too.
- And some best friend you are.

12:00.156 --> 12:02.993
I was this close to rubbing
knees with Shiny Money.

12:02.994 --> 12:05.191
It's elbows... Rubbing elbows.

12:05.192 --> 12:08.571
I can't do that. I
have sensitive elbows.

12:08.572 --> 12:10.485
At least something around
here is sensitive,

12:10.486 --> 12:13.237
because Austin clearly doesn't
care about our feelings.

12:13.238 --> 12:15.872
You know what? Forget it!

12:15.873 --> 12:19.869
I thought you all wanted to be there
tonight for me, but I was wrong.

12:19.870 --> 12:22.246
You're all acting like
selfish little kids.

12:22.247 --> 12:24.782
- Nuh-uh!
- You are!

12:24.783 --> 12:28.372
And I'm not spending my
night with a little kid.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.825
Come on, Nelson. Me and you
are going to the award show.

12:30.826 --> 12:34.306
I thought you'd never ask.

12:49.779 --> 12:52.605
- Did we really just...?
- Yup.

12:52.606 --> 12:56.481
- And Austin's going to...?
- Uh-huh.

12:56.482 --> 12:59.804
- So we're pretty much...
- The worst friends ever.

12:59.805 --> 13:04.154
Oh! I wanna play the
finish-the-sentence game!

13:04.155 --> 13:06.190
Say something, Trish.

13:06.191 --> 13:11.095
- Dez, you are such an...
- Elephant! Tractor! Pineapple!

13:11.096 --> 13:15.132
Yes, you are such an
elephant tractor pineapple.

13:15.133 --> 13:17.539
I'm great at this game.

13:17.540 --> 13:22.448
So now what? We sit here all night
feeling horrible about ourselves?

13:22.449 --> 13:25.089
Not necessarily.

13:25.124 --> 13:26.644
Wait a minute.

13:26.645 --> 13:28.787
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

13:28.788 --> 13:33.339
- We need to sneak into the show!
- It would be so cool to own a penguin.

13:33.340 --> 13:34.843
Sneak into the show?

13:34.844 --> 13:38.088
Trish, we've already upset
Austin enough for one night.

13:38.089 --> 13:40.324
And Dez, where would you
even keep a penguin?

13:40.325 --> 13:43.325
In a bathtub with ice?

13:43.326 --> 13:46.532
You guys heard Austin...
He wants us all there.

13:46.533 --> 13:48.939
We have to go there
and make this right.

13:48.940 --> 13:50.245
I guess.

13:50.246 --> 13:52.424
Great. So we're all
on the same page?

13:52.425 --> 13:58.325
Yes! I'll get the penguin, you get the ice
and we'll all meet at Ally's bathtub.

14:05.305 --> 14:08.273
Welcome back to the Miami
Internet Music Awards.

14:08.274 --> 14:10.789
Now to announce the nominees
for best viral video

14:10.790 --> 14:13.359
the stars of the summer
blockbuster "Mummy Mommy,"

14:13.360 --> 14:17.620
Cameron Diaz and
little Haley Carlisle!

14:24.212 --> 14:25.969
Whoa!

14:25.970 --> 14:29.030
Hotdogs and chocolate.

14:30.002 --> 14:32.837
Chocolate-covered hotdogs
remind me of Dez.

14:32.838 --> 14:36.678
Austin Moon, you're on in five!

14:37.050 --> 14:39.006
Yelling reminds me of Trish.

14:39.007 --> 14:41.887
Whoa, Cotton Candy!

14:42.425 --> 14:44.293
That reminds me of Ally.

14:44.294 --> 14:45.850
Cotton Candy?

14:45.851 --> 14:49.211
No, this picture of Ally.

14:51.211 --> 14:54.331
Why did I bring this?

14:54.892 --> 14:57.563
I just wish my
friends were here.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.253
I'm Cotton Candy man!

15:00.254 --> 15:02.534
Rawr rawr!

15:02.606 --> 15:04.498
I really really wish
my friends were here.

15:04.499 --> 15:06.915
Rawr rawr! Rawr!

15:06.916 --> 15:09.129
The Miami Internet Music
Awards will be back

15:09.130 --> 15:13.990
with Shiny Money and
special guest Austin Moon.

15:15.247 --> 15:18.282
Okay, we're in. Can we take
off these trash bags now?

15:18.283 --> 15:21.714
No, we need to look
like we belong here.

15:21.715 --> 15:25.612
Shiny Money's performing "Trash Talka'"
and his dancers wear trash bags.

15:25.613 --> 15:27.473
See?

15:28.444 --> 15:30.141
I think this is a
good look for me.

15:30.142 --> 15:36.042
And the best part is you never have
to worry about finding a trash can.

15:37.093 --> 15:41.280
Let's just find Austin. We'll be fine as
long as nobody who works here sees us.

15:41.281 --> 15:44.281
Like that guy! Hide.

15:48.578 --> 15:52.718
Show time. Everyone
take your places.

15:57.221 --> 15:59.731
Did we just move? I felt like...

15:59.732 --> 16:01.532
Ah!

16:06.529 --> 16:08.664
Check it out. It's Shiny
Money and Austin.

16:08.665 --> 16:11.065
Hey, Austin!

16:20.080 --> 16:23.656
Make some noise for the
one and only Shiny Money,

16:23.657 --> 16:28.533
with special guest Internet
sensation Austin Moon!

16:28.534 --> 16:30.569
Miami, make some noise.

16:30.570 --> 16:34.772
- What do we do?
- We could ask for his autograph.

16:34.773 --> 16:37.975
We about to take the
trash out on y'all.

16:37.976 --> 16:42.596
It's your boy Shiny
Money and Austin Moon.

16:44.270 --> 16:46.651
Shiny Money, Shiny Money.

16:46.652 --> 16:49.682
Shine to the money style.

16:49.683 --> 16:51.354
Woo!

16:51.355 --> 16:55.315
It's time to take out the trash.

16:57.496 --> 16:58.630
Woo!

16:58.631 --> 17:01.036
<i>It's shiny time,
it's shiny time.</i>

17:01.037 --> 17:06.077
<i>You gotta make make make
'em do a double take...</i>

17:06.373 --> 17:08.607
- What are you guys doing here?
- Trying to learn the dance.

17:08.608 --> 17:13.647
<i>You gotta make make make
'em do a double take...</i>

17:13.746 --> 17:15.946
- Austin, let me explain.
- I can't believe you guys.

17:15.948 --> 17:20.491
<i>You gotta make make make
'em do a double take...</i>

17:20.492 --> 17:23.104
- Austin, please.
- How could you guys get in here?

17:23.105 --> 17:27.103
<i>You gotta make make make
'em do a double take.</i>

17:27.104 --> 17:28.487
<i>They call me Shiny Money...</i>

17:28.488 --> 17:31.728
Hey you, get over here!

17:33.384 --> 17:34.808
I'll explain later!

17:34.809 --> 17:37.834
<i>Got a shiny smile, and
my perfect shiny face.</i>

17:37.835 --> 17:41.773
<i>Can be seen in the crowd all
the way from outer space.</i>

17:41.774 --> 17:45.529
<i>Shiny pants, shiny shoes, shiny
shades, gotta watch 'em groove.</i>

17:45.530 --> 17:47.446
<i>Shiny car with the
treble and bass.</i>

17:47.447 --> 17:52.067
<i>See me fly by, make
you do a double take.</i>

18:03.896 --> 18:07.187
<i>Hey, it's shiny time,
it's shiny time.</i>

18:07.188 --> 18:11.917
<i>You gotta make make make
'em do a double take.</i>

18:11.918 --> 18:14.672
<i>It's money time,
it's money time.</i>

18:14.673 --> 18:19.413
<i>You gotta make make make
'em do a double take.</i>

18:19.414 --> 18:22.146
<i>It's garbage time,
it's garbage time.</i>

18:22.147 --> 18:26.837
<i>You gotta make make make
'em do a double take.</i>

18:26.838 --> 18:29.482
<i>Now for the jump,
now for the jump.</i>

18:29.483 --> 18:34.403
<i>You gotta make make make
him do a double take.</i>

18:35.201 --> 18:37.001
Oh!

18:41.352 --> 18:45.672
I think we were
supposed to catch him.

18:50.288 --> 18:52.688
<i>Double take.</i>

19:04.014 --> 19:08.112
- You guys still here?
- Yeah, Austin, we are so sorry.

19:08.113 --> 19:10.247
Sorry for what?

19:10.248 --> 19:13.029
For caring more about yourselves
than you care about me?

19:13.030 --> 19:17.110
Uh, you're talking
to a trash bag.

19:17.685 --> 19:19.485
Oh.

19:19.916 --> 19:22.151
Sorry for what? For caring
more about yourselves...

19:22.152 --> 19:25.128
Austin! You're right.

19:25.129 --> 19:29.822
We were being selfish, but then we
realized tonight was about you, not us.

19:29.823 --> 19:33.217
That's why we came down here...
To support you.

19:33.218 --> 19:35.808
So you guys weren't just
thinking about yourselves?

19:35.809 --> 19:37.797
If I was only thinking
about myself,

19:37.798 --> 19:40.771
do you think I would wear
such a ridiculous outfit?

19:40.772 --> 19:45.226
Yeah, that purple dress you
had on earlier was awful.

19:45.227 --> 19:49.127
I'm talking about the trash bag.

19:49.135 --> 19:52.145
I'm sorry we ruined
the show for you.

19:52.146 --> 19:54.390
You didn't ruin it.

19:54.391 --> 19:56.653
Actually, you totally
ruined it...

19:56.654 --> 19:59.026
But I'm happy you guys came.

19:59.027 --> 20:00.045
Really?

20:00.046 --> 20:02.424
Yeah. We're a team.

20:02.425 --> 20:05.626
I couldn't imagine my first award
show without you guys here.

20:05.627 --> 20:10.720
Buddy, if I was wearing real pants, I'd
totally give 'em to you right now.

20:10.721 --> 20:16.098
Yeah, I think we should just
go back to fist-bumping.

20:16.099 --> 20:18.019
Boom!

20:21.293 --> 20:24.736
Hey, you're the two that
were supposed to catch me.

20:24.737 --> 20:27.093
- You're not still mad, are you?
- Still?

20:27.094 --> 20:30.371
It just happened an hour ago!

20:30.372 --> 20:32.491
Actually, it was two hours ago.

20:32.492 --> 20:35.043
You blacked out a little bit.

20:35.044 --> 20:37.783
My doctor said I can't perform
for at least eight months.

20:37.784 --> 20:38.897
Thanks a lot.

20:38.898 --> 20:40.452
- Hey, you're welcome.
- High five.

20:40.453 --> 20:42.253
Ah!

20:55.547 --> 20:58.812
This is way better than any
of those real after parties.

20:58.813 --> 21:03.238
Can you imagine me and Nelson
hanging out at that after party?

21:03.239 --> 21:06.479
Where is Nelson, anyway?

21:08.440 --> 21:12.235
This is the best day ever! Yeah!

21:12.236 --> 21:14.156
Yeah!

21:14.665 --> 21:16.585
Yeah!

21:17.495 --> 21:21.473
My hotdogs, oh yeah, oh yeah.
Woo!
