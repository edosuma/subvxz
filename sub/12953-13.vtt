01:19.471 --> 01:20.606
I betray them,

01:20.773 --> 01:22.769
I spend the rest of my life on the run.

01:22.815 --> 01:24.224
We can help you with that.

01:24.315 --> 01:25.930
You brought the payment?

01:27.145 --> 01:29.141
I hope you like diamonds.

01:42.749 --> 01:45.175
They are planning an attack -- large scale.

01:45.547 --> 01:46.540
Civilian target.

01:46.632 --> 01:47.243
Where?

01:47.750 --> 01:49.800
I'm not sure, but it's on the hard drive.

01:49.940 --> 01:51.070
Everything you need.

01:51.400 --> 01:53.110
Your man is in Los Angeles?

01:53.483 --> 01:54.573
He's ready.

01:54.804 --> 01:57.181
Have him proceed to locker 471.

01:57.275 --> 01:58.363
I'm on the move.

01:58.735 --> 02:02.594
The combination is 8-02-37.

02:04.743 --> 02:10.225
Has he found it?

02:12.796 --> 02:13.789
I have the package.

02:14.350 --> 02:15.198
He's got it.

02:25.438 --> 02:28.818
On the next turn, spin me and cut into the nearest dancers.

02:28.987 --> 02:30.456
Pleasure dancing with you.

02:43.409 --> 02:45.405
Carrie, have you seen my shoe? I really need to go.

02:45.497 --> 02:47.064
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I --

02:49.728 --> 02:51.914
Uh... found it.

02:52.008 --> 02:53.239
Who put it in the box?

02:53.706 --> 02:55.443
Okay. Hey, Marshall...

02:55.815 --> 02:57.191
Okay, I'm out of here.

02:57.330 --> 02:58.898
He's warm. He's warm.

02:58.943 --> 03:00.796
- Doesn't he feel warm?
- He just got out of the bath.

03:00.888 --> 03:02.023
No, it's not the bath. He's feverish.

03:02.163 --> 03:03.252
There's a temperature nozzle right by the sink.

03:03.344 --> 03:04.670
Looks like a pen. Just point it, and it'll tell you --

03:04.763 --> 03:06.903
- Just feel him. Feel him.
- He does feel a little warm.

03:07.025 --> 03:09.259
- Will you hold him?
- I can't take him right now.

03:09.306 --> 03:10.374
Carrie -- Carrie --

03:11.262 --> 03:14.165
Oh, boo-boo. Hold on a second.

03:14.960 --> 03:17.193
- Hello?
- Where are you?

03:17.287 --> 03:20.715
Oh, uh, hi, Mr. Heatherington. It's Mr. Heatherington.

03:20.854 --> 03:22.612
Dixon's en route with the hard drive.

03:22.658 --> 03:24.509
You were supposed to be here an hour ago. Where are you?

03:24.557 --> 03:27.699
Well, you know, we had a bit of a domestic crisis here.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.786
I'm not interested. Get in here.

03:29.881 --> 03:31.494
Okay, abso-- I'll be right in, sir.

03:31.587 --> 03:33.868
Thank you, Mr. Boss...man.

03:34.054 --> 03:35.363
You can't go back in.

03:35.456 --> 03:37.070
I have to. The server crashed, okay?

03:37.162 --> 03:38.585
He needs to go to the doctor, Marshall.

03:38.631 --> 03:39.863
Well, then you take him.

03:40.049 --> 03:44.051
Listen, Carrie, I'm sorry. I need your help right now.

03:44.190 --> 03:46.854
Have to get to work, okay? Okay, boo-boo.

03:56.158 --> 04:00.590
My contact here indicated Third Faction is planning a large-scale civilian attack.

04:00.776 --> 04:03.489
We'll have the hard drive decrypted by the time you touch down.

04:03.535 --> 04:05.750
Just don't spend too much time sight-seeing in Cuba.

04:05.843 --> 04:07.694
Don't worry. I'm ready to get out of here.

04:07.788 --> 04:10.261
Do you have any idea how hard it is to maintain cover

04:10.354 --> 04:12.635
while dancing the salsa in 3-inch heels?

04:12.822 --> 04:15.486
Yes, actually, I do, but let's keep that between us.

04:15.907 --> 04:17.377
You're doing the next intel swap.

04:17.470 --> 04:19.115
I don't care what the parameters are.

04:19.207 --> 04:21.488
Oh, nothing would make me happier. I love dancing.

04:21.610 --> 04:23.127
You hate to dance.

04:23.222 --> 04:24.213
How do you know?

04:24.306 --> 04:25.634
I've never seen you dance.

04:25.865 --> 04:28.386
Well, I'm a mysterious man. There are a lot of things you don't know about me.

04:28.461 --> 04:30.219
You've never once taken me dancing.

04:30.311 --> 04:31.878
Okay, let's go dancing.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.345
- Really?
- Yeah, sure.

04:33.859 --> 04:36.954
- But you hate dancing.
- And yet I'm taking you.

04:37.140 --> 04:39.231
Like I said, I'm very mysterious.

04:39.650 --> 04:41.694
- You see your driver?
- Yeah.

04:42.938 --> 04:43.814
Have a safe trip.

05:56.589 --> 05:57.486
Get down!

06:48.078 --> 06:49.213
I need a med tech!

06:52.633 --> 06:53.930
Attention, pathogen alert.

06:54.873 --> 06:55.913
This man is down!

06:56.146 --> 06:57.808
Attention, pathogen alert.

06:57.900 --> 06:59.275
I need some help here!

07:15.781 --> 07:16.487
Get back.

07:26.072 --> 07:27.972
Jeff, hand these out and make sure everyone gets one.

07:28.065 --> 07:28.723
You got it.

07:32.977 --> 07:34.256
Here. It's atropine.

07:37.155 --> 07:38.099
Vaughn!

07:38.191 --> 07:39.518
Don't touch him! Don't touch him!

07:39.844 --> 07:41.554
Let's get help. Come on.

07:42.628 --> 07:43.717
Here, inject yourself.

07:47.689 --> 07:49.334
Clear his airway.

07:50.220 --> 07:51.690
Dixon, it's all right. It's okay.

07:53.232 --> 07:54.302
It should start taking effect.

07:54.395 --> 07:54.957
It's working.

07:55.470 --> 07:57.562
Relax. Breathe.

08:25.748 --> 08:27.362
Schmuck, Alex?

08:45.185 --> 08:47.277
He was under the impression this was a negotiation.

08:48.148 --> 08:49.139
He was mistaken.

08:50.402 --> 08:53.589
Now I don't particularly care who you are and who you work with,

08:54.056 --> 08:56.435
but I'm sure your conspirators will have their hands full

08:56.481 --> 08:58.428
with the hard drive we sent you.

09:00.484 --> 09:00.954
Oh.

09:01.608 --> 09:03.223
All this is for them.

09:03.735 --> 09:05.921
I need him to see what I do to my enemies.

09:06.434 --> 09:08.286
I need him to see what I do to you.

09:11.512 --> 09:13.079
So would it help with your demonstration

09:13.170 --> 09:15.577
if I started crying and pleading for my life?

09:15.670 --> 09:18.554
You obviously don't understand your situation.

09:19.254 --> 09:21.631
He was my friend. You're not.

09:23.127 --> 09:26.414
I have something much worse planned for you.

10:04.049 --> 10:05.137
Yes, director.

10:05.510 --> 10:07.697
We'll keep you informed on the hour. Right.

10:07.976 --> 10:08.873
What's our status?

10:08.919 --> 10:10.420
Vents have been sealed, air filters are working,

10:10.512 --> 10:12.555
electricity shifted to backup generator.

10:12.696 --> 10:15.693
Our cover prevents local emergency responses from intervening.

10:16.066 --> 10:18.826
We'll have to wait for hazardous material team to give us a green light.

10:19.198 --> 10:21.577
Until then, proceed with quarantine protocol.

10:21.716 --> 10:23.281
When will the ICU be ready?

10:23.403 --> 10:25.254
Minutes. The hard drive Dixon brought in

10:25.301 --> 10:27.631
exploded after it was connected to A.P.O.'S network.

10:28.004 --> 10:30.907
It's possible our computer system has also been compromised.

10:30.999 --> 10:35.383
Right. Then we'll run an emergency diagnostic. Where's Marshall?

10:49.365 --> 10:50.169
Flinkman.

10:50.354 --> 10:52.922
Lockdown protocol 4-alpha-charlie. Confirm.

10:56.944 --> 10:57.794
Confirm!

10:58.073 --> 11:01.549
Yeah, sorry. 4-bravo-inkblot, confirm.

11:02.202 --> 11:04.724
Firewall networks are secure. We haven't been hacked.

11:05.050 --> 11:07.092
- Is this a drill?
- Unfortunately not.

11:07.232 --> 11:09.466
A nerve agent was released inside A.P.O.

11:09.558 --> 11:10.772
We've neutralized the threat,

11:10.818 --> 11:13.578
but our exposure is still a biohazard outside the office.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.712
Until we get cleared, no one comes in or out of here.

11:15.805 --> 11:17.514
Okay, okay, I got it. Is there anything --

11:17.606 --> 11:19.076
What can I do? What can I do?

11:19.170 --> 11:21.289
Nothing. Stay on the line. We'll tell you what we need.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.186
What the hell happened?

11:23.747 --> 11:24.978
We've been double-crossed.

11:25.071 --> 11:25.968
What about Sydney?

11:26.060 --> 11:27.389
She last checked in before x-fill.

11:28.089 --> 11:29.319
Have we confirmed the flight?

11:45.456 --> 11:46.974
Hello? Hel--

12:16.848 --> 12:18.270
Sydney, is that you?

12:18.360 --> 12:19.680
Don't hook up the hard drive.

12:19.730 --> 12:21.010
We know. Where are you?

12:21.340 --> 12:22.380
I'm not sure.

12:23.970 --> 12:24.963
They...

12:25.897 --> 12:28.228
they dragged me to a cemetery and knocked me out,

12:28.348 --> 12:31.156
and I woke up in a coffin.

12:32.371 --> 12:34.939
Syd, are you...

12:35.920 --> 12:37.534
Have you been buried?

12:38.561 --> 12:39.267
Yes.

12:41.464 --> 12:42.410
Stay calm.

12:42.736 --> 12:43.775
We're going to find you.

12:44.662 --> 12:45.943
What about your contact?

12:47.111 --> 12:50.443
They shot him. He's in the coffin with me.

12:51.610 --> 12:53.559
We have CIA family support in Cuba.

12:53.651 --> 12:56.316
No, we don't. We're black ops. We're on our own.

12:56.718 --> 12:58.952
You guys have to come get me.

13:00.120 --> 13:02.210
Sydney, the hard drive has been rigged.

13:02.257 --> 13:04.682
It released some sort of a toxin in here. We're in lockdown.

13:05.008 --> 13:05.953
Lockdown?

13:09.131 --> 13:10.173
For how long?

13:10.685 --> 13:13.349
We estimate about 36 hours.

13:14.938 --> 13:16.600
Okay, what are our other options?

13:18.468 --> 13:20.368
Um, excuse me.

13:20.414 --> 13:22.840
I know you told me you would let me know if you needed anything, but

13:23.587 --> 13:24.676
I could do it.

13:26.077 --> 13:27.118
I could go to Cuba.

13:27.819 --> 13:29.702
Wait a minute. Marshall, you're --

13:29.793 --> 13:31.501
you're not in lockdown with the rest of the team?

13:31.596 --> 13:33.208
No, Syd, listen. Mitchell -- this morning --

13:33.347 --> 13:36.011
it's a long story. How many bars do you have on your cell phone?

13:38.021 --> 13:38.727
Four.

13:38.821 --> 13:39.861
Four. Okay, good. That's excellent.

13:39.953 --> 13:42.570
Every cell phone has a distinct radio frequency that's traceable.

13:42.709 --> 13:43.606
If we can get a locator --

13:43.700 --> 13:44.931
But there's no way to get the op-tech to you.

13:45.024 --> 13:47.305
Well, I could rig one in country, okay?

13:47.398 --> 13:48.678
I mean, the only thing is, Syd,

13:48.771 --> 13:50.288
you would have to stay off the phone while I'm traveling.

13:50.382 --> 13:52.903
You know, just to conserve the battery.

13:54.491 --> 13:56.008
Done. We go with this.

13:56.147 --> 13:58.698
Marshall, there'll be a visa and a passport for you at the airport.

13:58.791 --> 14:01.120
Passport and visa. Passport -- okay.

14:01.214 --> 14:02.398
Okay, I'm going.

14:04.454 --> 14:08.312
Marshall, Sydney has a limited supply of oxygen in that coffin.

14:08.359 --> 14:10.306
We have no margin for error. Understood?

14:10.353 --> 14:14.450
Yeah. I understand. I can do this.

14:24.504 --> 14:26.118
- Sydney, I want --
- No, I get it.

14:26.256 --> 14:28.491
I'm hanging up now.

15:37.144 --> 15:39.838
Reports confirm that ten containers of cyclosarin

15:39.930 --> 15:42.882
were stolen a week ago from a warehouse in Morocco.

15:43.160 --> 15:44.753
They hit us with a drop.

15:44.848 --> 15:47.179
Less than a gram, according to lab analysis.

15:47.271 --> 15:50.794
Third Faction has enough toxin to infect an entire city.

15:51.214 --> 15:52.731
I want their target.

15:52.825 --> 15:55.899
Cross-check all D.I.A. and echelon watchlists.

15:56.039 --> 15:59.085
Consult with all of our contacts patrolling major ports.

15:59.223 --> 15:59.930
You know the protocol.

16:00.024 --> 16:01.111
How long has she been in the ground?

16:01.157 --> 16:01.959
Look at me!

16:06.399 --> 16:07.488
Marshall's on his way.

16:08.796 --> 16:11.221
We'll get Sydney out. Make no mistake.

16:13.043 --> 16:15.136
Third Faction wants us on our heels.

16:15.676 --> 16:17.338
They think they can bomb our operation.

16:17.430 --> 16:19.426
They think they can bury our agents alive.

16:19.547 --> 16:21.113
And they think that will stop us.

16:21.719 --> 16:25.244
Well, they're wrong. We have a job to do.

16:26.413 --> 16:27.406
Get to work.

16:41.110 --> 16:44.252
Uh...uh, uh, do you have a screwdriver?

16:44.346 --> 16:45.863
A flathead screwdriver, por favor?

16:50.716 --> 16:52.854
That can't be regular spanish. That's way too fast.

16:53.181 --> 16:54.747
Could you slow down, por favor?

16:57.004 --> 16:57.913
You know what? Never --

17:06.810 --> 17:08.758
Hola. Cómo esta?

17:10.252 --> 17:12.439
All right, she's really starting to freak me out a little bit.

17:12.486 --> 17:13.049
Qué?

17:13.142 --> 17:15.854
Okay, uh, do you have, uh, a radio?

17:15.994 --> 17:16.588
You know...

17:17.633 --> 17:19.155
Un radio.

17:19.201 --> 17:20.861
Sí, sí. Un radio, radio.

17:25.094 --> 17:28.678
It's the same... in spanish.

17:29.425 --> 17:30.800
Ahh. Bueno.

17:33.277 --> 17:33.937
Uh...

17:38.892 --> 17:40.411
these your chickens?

17:45.600 --> 17:46.163
Bueno.

18:48.142 --> 18:49.564
Syd, slow down.

18:51.013 --> 18:52.292
Say that again.

18:52.712 --> 18:53.753
We can I.D. him.

18:53.894 --> 18:54.504
Who?

18:54.672 --> 18:57.575
Phantom. My contact. I can send you a picture.

18:57.809 --> 18:59.736
You can check it against airport surveillance,

18:59.831 --> 19:02.541
inbound flights to Cuba. He wasn't alone on it.

19:03.382 --> 19:06.381
Get visuals of the other members of Third Faction and...

19:07.642 --> 19:08.827
track that against...

19:09.433 --> 19:11.095
where they've been and where they're --

19:11.609 --> 19:12.552
where they're going.

19:12.646 --> 19:13.734
Send the photo.

19:21.637 --> 19:22.772
Okay, Syd, we got it. We're indexing it now.

19:25.064 --> 19:26.054
Vaughn?

19:26.195 --> 19:27.711
Yeah, I'm here. Can you hear me?

19:28.553 --> 19:29.927
I know what he looks like.

19:31.657 --> 19:33.414
Syd, we got the picture. We're working on it.

19:33.553 --> 19:35.931
We can check it against airport surveillance.

19:37.332 --> 19:38.803
Syd, you already said that.

19:38.943 --> 19:39.887
He wasn't alone.

19:42.271 --> 19:44.840
We can find where he's been, where he's going.

19:58.541 --> 19:59.153
Yeah?

19:59.246 --> 20:00.430
Marshall, what's your status?

20:00.524 --> 20:02.948
Well, it's really hot here and everyone keeps calling me "chango."

20:03.040 --> 20:04.082
Marshall, where are you?

20:04.130 --> 20:06.936
We're close. Really close. I've got her signal locked in.

20:09.319 --> 20:10.360
We don't have much time.

20:11.154 --> 20:12.195
I understand.

20:12.287 --> 20:12.850
Hold on.

20:13.547 --> 20:14.482
Okay.

20:14.763 --> 20:17.905
Okay, senor, turn here. Turn here, sir.

20:18.557 --> 20:20.553
Senor, aquí! Aquí!

20:22.891 --> 20:23.741
Sí, sí.

20:24.161 --> 20:25.440
I took a little spanish in college.

20:41.198 --> 20:43.241
Syd, Marshall's on his way.

20:44.502 --> 20:46.117
We'll be dancing before you know it.

20:47.052 --> 20:48.903
Yet my feet touch the ground.

20:49.884 --> 20:50.925
What was that?

20:53.001 --> 20:53.731
Sydney?

20:54.104 --> 20:54.668
Vaughn?

20:59.626 --> 21:01.667
My phone is dying. Vaughn?

21:03.116 --> 21:05.262
Okay, aquí. All right, Mr. Bristow, I'm here.

21:05.341 --> 21:07.769
I'm here at the cemetery. Hold on.

21:08.095 --> 21:10.139
Syd, Marshall's there. Hang on.

21:11.214 --> 21:13.161
I just -- I just need to...

21:14.516 --> 21:16.561
Find out which grave she's in.

21:24.275 --> 21:26.796
Syd! Sydney?

21:41.387 --> 21:46.106
Okay. Okay. Uh, no. No, no, no, no, no! No! No!

21:52.702 --> 21:53.264
Damn it.

21:55.556 --> 21:56.310
Vaughn?

21:57.571 --> 21:58.134
Vaughn?

22:07.581 --> 22:09.719
4...5...

22:10.467 --> 22:12.224
6...7.

22:12.316 --> 22:14.407
7. There are 7 fresh graves here.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.162
Marshall, you don't have time to dig them all up.

22:16.208 --> 22:17.488
Is there any way to narrow it down?

22:18.563 --> 22:19.747
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

22:20.259 --> 22:23.450
Vaughn, can you task a satellite over my position?

22:27.938 --> 22:29.074
All right, I'm here. What do I do?

22:29.213 --> 22:31.447
Well, tasking a satellite from the NRO will take forever,

22:31.540 --> 22:33.516
so go to the config-dot-sys menu.

22:33.656 --> 22:34.601
My phone has GPS,

22:34.693 --> 22:36.402
so you should be able to route the coordinates through the system.

22:37.617 --> 22:38.133
Got it.

22:38.273 --> 22:42.035
Okay, now type kh-11-backslash-int-backslash-
therm-backslash-config-dot-sys.

22:42.082 --> 22:43.123
Let me know when you're there.

22:43.196 --> 22:44.237
Hang on. I don't see a prompt.

22:44.330 --> 22:45.847
Well, there is no prompt. The prompt's implied.

22:45.941 --> 22:47.076
What, I'm supposed to just type it in?

22:47.168 --> 22:48.591
Yes, god, Vaughn, this isn't that hard.

22:48.685 --> 22:49.821
Well, I've never done this before.

22:49.961 --> 22:52.576
Well, I do it for you people all the time. Now come on.

22:54.259 --> 22:56.017
- Okay, I have a visual.
- Okay, great, great, great.

22:56.109 --> 22:58.296
The commands I gave you should change the view to thermal.

23:01.662 --> 23:02.798
Okay, wait, I see her.

23:03.452 --> 23:06.259
Eight rows north from where you are, three graves west.

23:06.492 --> 23:08.488
North, west, okay. I'm on it.

23:09.142 --> 23:11.854
No, Marshall, stop. Turn around. Your other north.

23:18.994 --> 23:21.040
Okay, all right.

23:21.134 --> 23:22.669
That's it. It's right in front of you.

23:22.761 --> 23:23.687
I got it. I got it.

24:06.184 --> 24:10.328
Syd? Syd? Syd, can you hear me? I'm coming.

24:22.442 --> 24:24.295
Oh, my god. No. No.

24:36.967 --> 24:37.673
Syd?

24:37.813 --> 24:39.761
Syd? Syd? Syd?

24:40.508 --> 24:43.031
Syd? Syd? Syd?

24:43.965 --> 24:44.720
Oh, my god.

24:44.905 --> 24:45.329
Okay.

24:48.088 --> 24:49.846
1, 2. Come on. Come on.

25:06.481 --> 25:07.251
Okay.

25:08.138 --> 25:10.229
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

25:16.211 --> 25:17.936
Syd?

25:20.066 --> 25:20.535
Oh, god.

25:22.313 --> 25:24.116
That's her. She's moving.

25:28.324 --> 25:30.415
Syd? You okay?

25:32.557 --> 25:34.574
- Marshall.
- Yeah.

25:56.816 --> 26:00.961
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

26:04.421 --> 26:05.987
We have an I.D. on the phantom.

26:06.081 --> 26:08.171
Alex Rucker. High-tech specialist.

26:08.357 --> 26:15.176
He was recruited for the Third Faction by this man -- Ulrich Koture.

26:16.234 --> 26:16.939
That's him.

26:17.313 --> 26:19.785
The phantom says another chemical attack is eminent.

26:19.878 --> 26:24.261
The assumption is that Ulrich has the intel we need to stop it on his computer.

26:24.682 --> 26:29.734
Sydney, Marshall, A.P.O. is in lockdown for at least another 24 hours.

26:29.780 --> 26:31.106
Your mission is not over.

26:31.200 --> 26:33.722
This picture was taken 10 hours ago at a Berlin airport.

26:33.860 --> 26:37.097
Ulrich operates out of a nightclub there. Infiltrate the club.

26:37.190 --> 26:40.809
Find Ulrich's hard drive and upload its contents to us.

26:40.902 --> 26:44.283
Ulrich knows me. There's no way I can get close to him.

26:45.124 --> 26:47.434
But we could send in someone else.

26:50.520 --> 26:51.941
I've never been to Berlin.

27:02.416 --> 27:05.558
Make eye contact with everyone, particularly Ulrich's bodyguards.

27:05.604 --> 27:06.262
Why?

27:06.355 --> 27:07.970
You have to convince them you're not scared.

27:08.062 --> 27:10.726
Right. Yeah, I think you're supposed to do that in prison, too, I heard.

27:10.819 --> 27:13.150
The flash drive inside will automatically begin transfer

27:13.242 --> 27:15.766
when you're within range of his computer, but you have to get kind of close.

27:15.813 --> 27:17.045
- How close?
- 2, 3 feet.

27:17.136 --> 27:19.417
Syd, this guy, he buried you alive.

27:19.698 --> 27:21.550
Yeah, but he cheated. He hit me with a car first.

27:21.643 --> 27:24.259
- Ordinary cell phone, right?
- Right.

27:24.445 --> 27:25.723
Snap off the back.

27:26.049 --> 27:28.810
You've got your barrel, your trigger, magazine.

27:28.903 --> 27:30.469
- The magazine holds two bullets.
- I know.

27:30.562 --> 27:31.794
- Be careful when you load it --
- Syd, I know.

27:31.886 --> 27:35.648
I built that, remember? I mean, I built all this stuff.

27:35.740 --> 27:37.641
- It's different in the field.
- I know.

27:37.781 --> 27:41.258
So be careful when you load it, because this is very sensitive up here.

27:41.349 --> 27:42.819
Hold on a sec.

27:43.754 --> 27:44.747
It's Carrie.

27:44.933 --> 27:46.309
Hey, honey. Hi.

27:47.150 --> 27:48.667
What time is it?

27:48.993 --> 27:52.660
Oh. Sorry, uh, how's he doing? Is he okay?

27:52.753 --> 27:54.558
We didn't -- I mean, I didn't realize --

27:54.837 --> 27:57.023
Oh, poor Mitchell.

27:57.115 --> 27:59.160
You know what? Put him on. Yeah, put him on.

27:59.299 --> 28:00.865
Did you try that thing where you --

28:00.958 --> 28:01.836
Okay, yeah, put him on.

28:01.883 --> 28:04.738
Hey. Hey, boo-boo. Hi.

28:05.157 --> 28:06.151
Daddy loves you.

28:06.243 --> 28:08.140
Ahem. Hush, hush...

28:08.496 --> 28:11.590
Hush, little Mitchell, don't you cry

28:11.682 --> 28:14.443
daddy's gonna teach you about lanthanides

28:15.143 --> 28:17.759
cerium is first, yes, it leads the way

28:17.851 --> 28:20.499
hexagonal structure, and it's iron-gray

28:20.918 --> 28:23.822
praseodymium is next, and it looks like brass --

28:23.913 --> 28:24.858
What?

28:25.512 --> 28:28.080
No, I can't make it home right now. I'm sor--

28:28.221 --> 28:29.834
Tonight. I promise.

28:30.114 --> 28:32.729
By tonight. That's the best I can do. I'm sorry. Yes.

28:32.868 --> 28:34.769
Yes, Carrie, it's a crisis.

28:36.264 --> 28:37.095
Carrie --

28:43.733 --> 28:45.585
I told her I'd be home tonight.

28:46.333 --> 28:47.468
You will.

28:48.871 --> 28:49.672
Okay.

28:51.073 --> 28:51.733
Here.

28:52.432 --> 28:52.996
Right.

28:54.117 --> 28:55.014
Wish me luck.

29:13.299 --> 29:15.248
Okay, I'm in. Now what do I do?

29:15.323 --> 29:16.076
What do you see?

29:16.168 --> 29:18.785
Well, a lot of people who are into spanking, apparently.

29:25.925 --> 29:27.845
Oh, my god, I think I just got hepatitis.

29:27.938 --> 29:28.361
What?

29:28.454 --> 29:31.071
This woman who looks like Marlene Dietrich, she just kissed me.

29:31.444 --> 29:32.866
I don't think she's in on it, though.

29:32.959 --> 29:35.480
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. Okay.

29:36.228 --> 29:38.701
I see a back office. There's bouncers standing guard

29:38.747 --> 29:41.029
and apparently a lot of men with guns.

29:41.216 --> 29:43.450
You can do this. Just remember what we talked about.

29:43.542 --> 29:46.731
Eye contact. Now walk up to them and repeat exactly what I tell you.

29:46.825 --> 29:47.627
Thank you.

29:49.637 --> 29:50.439
Okay.

30:12.071 --> 30:13.682
I'm, uh...

30:14.756 --> 30:16.084
here to see Ulrich.

30:16.175 --> 30:17.502
Ulrich not seeing anyone.

30:17.643 --> 30:20.354
Tell him Alex wasn't the only one betraying him.

30:20.587 --> 30:23.394
Tell him Alex wasn't the only one betraying him.

30:24.375 --> 30:25.416
Ulrich...

30:28.902 --> 30:30.593
This way.

30:43.639 --> 30:44.490
Thank you.

30:44.582 --> 30:45.909
Okay.

30:48.620 --> 30:51.886
Mr. Koture, thank you for taking the time to --

30:51.979 --> 30:52.495
Stop.

30:53.272 --> 30:54.407
I don't know who you are,

30:54.500 --> 30:56.448
and you're distracting me at a critical juncture,

30:56.543 --> 30:59.350
so I hope you have something interesting to tell me, mr...

30:59.489 --> 31:00.577
Okay, this guy's a blowhard.

31:01.323 --> 31:02.460
Bristow.

31:02.786 --> 31:03.761
Jack Bristow.

31:03.853 --> 31:04.894
That's -- that's good.

31:05.362 --> 31:08.501
And if I'm wasting your time by being polite,

31:09.437 --> 31:11.097
I'm happy to walk out of here.

31:11.191 --> 31:12.470
Wait, don't go overboard.

31:12.656 --> 31:14.937
Just don't call me when the Third Faction goes down in flames.

31:14.984 --> 31:16.263
Don't mention Third Faction!

31:24.540 --> 31:27.347
You said you had information about my men. Now what is it?

31:27.721 --> 31:29.620
Marshall, I'm not getting a reading from the flash drive.

31:29.713 --> 31:31.900
Get the case closer to Ulrich's computer.

31:36.267 --> 31:38.215
- Cigarette?
- No thanks.

31:51.308 --> 31:55.453
I have some... conversations on tape.

31:55.546 --> 31:57.542
Perfect. And just keep that going for two minutes.

31:57.635 --> 31:59.487
Tell him he's mentioned on the tapes.

31:59.626 --> 32:01.526
You're mentioned on those tapes.

32:01.992 --> 32:03.702
My men would never go to the government.

32:03.795 --> 32:06.795
No, but they would sell you out to the Slobodan Wolves.

32:06.885 --> 32:10.267
No, but they would sell you out to the Slobodan Wolf.

32:10.359 --> 32:11.972
- Wolves.
- Wolves.

32:12.673 --> 32:15.146
So, who -- who's doing this?

32:16.033 --> 32:17.886
Dietrich Gustof, his third in command.

32:17.978 --> 32:19.259
Dietrich Gustof,

32:19.912 --> 32:21.479
your third in command.

32:22.367 --> 32:24.075
I'm confused by something.

32:24.215 --> 32:26.020
You say you have these recordings,

32:27.189 --> 32:29.566
and Dietrich, well, he only speaks german.

32:29.892 --> 32:30.600
So?

32:30.830 --> 32:32.206
Doesn't that mean...

32:43.896 --> 32:46.226
Okay, he just insulted you. Now say...

32:50.856 --> 32:52.325
I work for myself.

32:53.119 --> 32:54.877
And as for these tapes,

32:55.438 --> 32:57.625
it's none of your business how I got them.

32:57.763 --> 32:58.898
And my german...

33:04.715 --> 33:06.091
Now laugh like it's all a big joke.

33:10.673 --> 33:12.143
Uh, Syd, we've got a problem.

33:12.284 --> 33:12.752
What is it?

33:12.892 --> 33:14.553
The hard drive's connected to network firewall.

33:14.646 --> 33:16.193
Everything you're sending us is encrypted.

33:16.287 --> 33:18.807
But hold on. I'm checking all the computer shipments to your location.

33:18.901 --> 33:21.372
If we can figure out the system, we might be able to bypass it.

33:21.420 --> 33:22.651
All right, mr. Bristow.

33:23.164 --> 33:25.924
Bring me that tape, and we'll cut a deal.

33:26.016 --> 33:28.251
Marshall, we've hit a glitch. Stall.

33:28.998 --> 33:30.611
Okay, Syd, we've isolated the firewall.

33:30.685 --> 33:31.917
It's located in the basement of the club.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.242
- I'm on my way.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait.

33:33.335 --> 33:35.092
The firewall is biometrically linked to Ulrich.

33:35.186 --> 33:36.703
You have to get him down there to disable it.

33:36.750 --> 33:38.983
Marshall, change of plans. The hard drive is encrypted.

33:39.075 --> 33:42.028
We need Ulrich in the basement to shut down a network firewall.

33:42.729 --> 33:46.396
I'm afraid we can't do that just yet.

33:46.535 --> 33:48.913
Nein? Is there some sort of problem?

33:49.034 --> 33:50.388
Marshall, you have a gun. Use it.

33:50.527 --> 33:52.858
Get him to the elevator. I'll meet you in the basement.

33:53.230 --> 33:54.558
You know what they say.

33:55.867 --> 33:58.006
Never discuss money on your first meeting.

33:58.313 --> 34:01.100
Well, I sort of need to settle on a fee first.

34:01.195 --> 34:03.285
We will negotiate that after I see what you have.

34:03.424 --> 34:04.560
Afraid I can't do that.

34:05.072 --> 34:07.307
Kind of a policy I have. Cash up front.

34:07.400 --> 34:09.539
Not really a policy, per se.

34:09.632 --> 34:11.772
More of a been burned by too many

34:11.866 --> 34:15.101
fly-by-night terrorists to trust them sort of thing.

34:15.335 --> 34:18.284
You know, one day they say "we'll pay you in gold,"

34:18.331 --> 34:21.284
the next they say, "did we say gold? We meant --"

34:24.089 --> 34:25.463
Marshall, are you okay?

34:26.304 --> 34:27.250
Oh, my god.

34:27.481 --> 34:30.815
Syd, I think I just killed Ulrich.

34:34.743 --> 34:35.257
Syd!

34:35.379 --> 34:37.184
Syd, I need your help now.

34:37.277 --> 34:38.603
Hang in there. I'm on my way.

34:38.882 --> 34:40.716
What type of biometric scanner are they dealing with?

34:40.902 --> 34:41.895
Retinal.

34:42.829 --> 34:44.348
Marshall, can you hear me?

34:44.627 --> 34:46.335
Hey, Mr. Bristow. Listen, I'm really sorry.

34:46.428 --> 34:47.946
It was an accident. I didn't mean to shoot --

34:48.085 --> 34:49.460
Marshall, we are going through with this mission.

34:49.739 --> 34:51.784
Look around. Do you see any sort of cutting tool?

34:51.969 --> 34:53.391
A knife of some sort, or --

34:53.952 --> 34:54.563
No.

34:54.748 --> 34:56.793
Look on the desk. Is there a letter opener?

34:57.260 --> 34:57.871
Uh...

34:59.506 --> 35:01.072
Yeah. Got it. Why?

35:01.568 --> 35:03.258
You have to cut out Ulrich's eyes.

35:05.035 --> 35:05.883
Oh, my god.

35:06.023 --> 35:09.212
The biometric scanner in the basement operates off Ulrich's retinas.

35:09.352 --> 35:10.250
No. No, I --

35:10.670 --> 35:12.284
You don't have time to get his body into the basement.

35:12.425 --> 35:14.132
Mr. Bristow, no, I can't do that. I'm sorry.

35:14.224 --> 35:15.456
Yes, you can.

35:16.391 --> 35:17.574
I can talk you through it.

35:20.286 --> 35:21.040
Okay.

35:22.704 --> 35:23.411
All right.

35:51.612 --> 35:52.747
I'm ready. Go ahead.

35:52.841 --> 35:54.787
You have to go under the eye and sever the optic nerve.

35:54.833 --> 35:57.738
- Okay.
- Brace the head.

35:57.831 --> 36:00.019
The bundle is denser than you think it's going to be.

36:00.437 --> 36:01.478
All right.

36:01.851 --> 36:03.703
Here -- here we go.

36:15.255 --> 36:18.205
Oh, god, it's oozing. It's oozing everywhere, sir.

36:18.392 --> 36:20.340
That means you've ruptured the macula.

36:21.228 --> 36:23.367
The eye is useless. Abandon it.

36:23.881 --> 36:26.306
Approach the second one gently,

36:26.446 --> 36:28.154
like a soft boiled egg.

36:28.601 --> 36:31.647
You're going to need a digging instrument to assist with this.

36:33.786 --> 36:35.740
I got a spork.

36:36.162 --> 36:37.440
What's a spork?

36:37.533 --> 36:40.436
It's like a half spoon, half fork. Will that do?

36:40.512 --> 36:41.266
That will work.

36:41.452 --> 36:43.973
Okay. Okay. Okay.

36:48.882 --> 36:50.763
All right.

36:50.858 --> 36:51.898
Soft boiled egg.

36:52.972 --> 36:53.775
Soft...

37:12.902 --> 37:13.656
Done.

37:24.039 --> 37:24.841
Come on.

37:40.465 --> 37:42.222
Here, you do it. I can't look at it anymore.

38:02.567 --> 38:03.512
How much time do you need?

38:03.651 --> 38:04.357
15 seconds.

38:08.378 --> 38:09.564
Marshall, it's working.

38:14.754 --> 38:15.365
I'm out.

38:16.860 --> 38:17.566
Syd.

38:21.916 --> 38:22.527
Got it.

38:31.507 --> 38:33.455
Okay, we've got a location on the bomb -- Hong Kong.

38:33.641 --> 38:35.590
I'm alerting the local CIA offices now.

38:38.254 --> 38:40.155
Sydney, are you and Marshall all right?

38:40.995 --> 38:41.749
We're fine.

38:51.851 --> 38:53.752
The ministry of security confirmed the seizure

38:53.796 --> 38:56.079
of a cyclosarin bomb in downtown Hong Kong.

38:56.172 --> 38:58.311
They have expressed their gratitude to Langley.

38:58.404 --> 39:02.166
Third Faction's operation extended far beyond our original estimate.

39:02.306 --> 39:04.206
The hard drive that Marshall downloaded

39:04.300 --> 39:07.537
contained hundreds of names of contacts throughout Europe and Asia,

39:07.723 --> 39:09.957
which we will have to confirm.

39:10.143 --> 39:12.073
Start with all arms-related activities.

39:12.166 --> 39:14.449
Don't limit your parameters to chemical weapons.

39:18.657 --> 39:20.461
So where are we?

39:25.045 --> 39:27.422
Third Faction had few political affiliations.

39:27.562 --> 39:32.664
Their primary interest was maximizing profit off of terrorist activities...

39:47.159 --> 39:49.061
These are not the clothes I left the house in.

39:49.152 --> 39:50.272
What do I tell Carrie?

39:50.410 --> 39:52.501
Maybe you had spare clothes at the office.

39:56.943 --> 39:59.369
I hate lying to her, Syd.

40:00.584 --> 40:01.433
Syd...

40:02.397 --> 40:04.153
I hate lying to Carrie.

40:05.650 --> 40:06.261
I know.

40:07.381 --> 40:09.471
Part of the job though, right?

40:10.201 --> 40:11.719
Well, you could tell her the truth --

40:12.468 --> 40:15.035
That you had to cut out a man's eyes to save the world.

40:16.205 --> 40:18.200
Yeah. I could tell her that.

40:18.854 --> 40:21.614
Probably be best just to keep that between us.

40:23.484 --> 40:25.526
And I didn't save the world exactly.

40:25.621 --> 40:26.805
Just Hong Kong.

40:28.440 --> 40:29.673
You saved me.

40:31.776 --> 40:32.606
Yeah.

40:34.194 --> 40:35.808
All in a day's work.

40:40.345 --> 40:41.290
Anyway...

40:41.896 --> 40:44.656
you want to come in and get some dinner with us?

40:44.888 --> 40:47.649
Yeah, and how would we explain that I drove you home?

40:47.788 --> 40:49.163
I don't know, we could come up with something.

40:49.256 --> 40:51.921
We're quick on our feet. We're spies.

40:52.013 --> 40:53.054
Thank you, but...

40:54.316 --> 40:56.360
I need to go wait at the train station.

40:58.369 --> 40:59.840
There's someone I need to see.

41:01.616 --> 41:02.513
Yeah.

41:03.447 --> 41:04.440
I know the feeling.

41:07.993 --> 41:08.892
I'll see you tomorrow?

41:09.170 --> 41:09.877
Okay.

41:13.383 --> 41:13.994
Bye.
