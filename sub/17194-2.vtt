01:18.100 --> 01:20.552
This lad here, number 7,

01:20.554 --> 01:22.220
just up and disappeared,

01:22.222 --> 01:23.722
same as the other sons,
brothers, cousins...

01:23.724 --> 01:25.223
all from Five Points.

01:25.225 --> 01:28.026
Two dead, five missing.

01:28.028 --> 01:29.728
I can't have a repeat killer

01:29.730 --> 01:31.296
hunting my streets.

01:31.298 --> 01:32.731
Two bodies.

01:32.733 --> 01:34.366
Maybe the other five
were kidnapped.

01:34.368 --> 01:36.568
Even worse... a killer
and a kidnapper.

01:36.570 --> 01:39.337
Donovan,

01:39.339 --> 01:41.706
you ever hear of
Hydrargyri Chloridum?

01:41.708 --> 01:44.242
I thought you were
a copper, not a chemist.

01:44.244 --> 01:45.744
There's a doctor

01:45.746 --> 01:48.814
who helps me with cases,
from time to time.

01:48.816 --> 01:51.449
Now, McGrath,

01:51.451 --> 01:53.051
this boy, was found face-down

01:53.053 --> 01:54.519
in a pit of his own vomit.

01:54.521 --> 01:56.740
This doctor found traces
of Hydrargyri Chloridum

01:57.047 --> 01:58.723
in that vomit.

01:58.725 --> 02:01.326
The second body was the same...

02:01.328 --> 02:03.195
vomit laced with the drug.

02:03.197 --> 02:04.629
So either our neighborhood's

02:04.631 --> 02:05.630
found itself a new addiction...

02:05.632 --> 02:07.666
Or someone's
poisoning our boys.

02:10.836 --> 02:12.270
So you're saying you believe

02:12.272 --> 02:13.905
that Michael McGrath
is innocent

02:13.907 --> 02:15.407
of his brother's murder?

02:15.409 --> 02:17.042
Innocent and still missing.

02:17.044 --> 02:20.245
With hope, alive.

02:20.247 --> 02:21.813
And if these other kids
were poisoned,

02:21.815 --> 02:23.315
we need to figure out
who they were with

02:23.317 --> 02:24.816
and where they were drinking.

02:24.818 --> 02:26.985
Let's not let the body
count get any higher,

02:26.987 --> 02:28.520
hmm, detective?

02:47.840 --> 02:50.775
Kevin.

02:50.777 --> 02:53.678
Where are Maggie's things?

02:53.680 --> 02:57.349
Did Annie steal them?

02:57.351 --> 02:58.583
Or did you?

02:58.585 --> 03:01.553
You want this to be over,

03:01.555 --> 03:03.054
but it will never

03:03.056 --> 03:05.090
be over.

03:05.092 --> 03:07.792
Ignore me, that's fine!

03:07.794 --> 03:09.794
Maybe you can force Maggie

03:09.796 --> 03:11.296
out of your life,

03:11.298 --> 03:13.064
but you cannot force
her out of mine!

03:13.066 --> 03:18.270
You can't make me forget
or forgive myself!

03:18.272 --> 03:19.771
What did you do, Kevin?

03:24.410 --> 03:27.612
Oh, God.

03:27.614 --> 03:29.814
I didn't know what
to do, Corky.

03:29.816 --> 03:32.517
Your Ellen was acting
all loony again.

03:41.260 --> 03:42.427
Was that

03:42.429 --> 03:44.296
your Maggie's?

03:44.298 --> 03:46.531
Don't say nothin', child.

03:54.974 --> 03:58.209
It's him! The rebel Kennedy!

03:58.211 --> 04:00.211
There he is! Kennedy!

04:00.213 --> 04:02.013
Come on, it's
that bastard, Kennedy!

04:02.015 --> 04:03.515
Come on, let's get him!

04:03.517 --> 04:05.016
Rot in hell, Kennedy!

04:05.018 --> 04:07.252
I hope they hang you,
you bastard!

04:07.254 --> 04:08.954
Get him!

04:08.956 --> 04:10.956
Stay back!

04:17.964 --> 04:20.398
Traitor!

04:20.399 --> 04:22.801
Get out of here!

04:27.741 --> 04:31.710
Robert!

04:31.712 --> 04:34.179
Ahh, Robert.

04:34.181 --> 04:36.381
Glad you're here.

04:36.383 --> 04:37.916
You have to help me.

04:37.918 --> 04:40.518
They're treating me
like a savage.

04:40.520 --> 04:42.587
I'm an innocent man being
held on false charges.

04:42.589 --> 04:44.089
You know this.

04:44.091 --> 04:45.824
Tell 'em. They'll listen to ya!

04:45.826 --> 04:48.526
You have been charged
as a confederate spy,

04:48.528 --> 04:50.028
yet you claim innocence?

04:50.030 --> 04:51.329
I do.

04:51.331 --> 04:53.331
You cannot possibly believe

04:53.333 --> 04:54.699
that you're guiltless.

04:54.701 --> 04:57.068
I was acting under
confidential orders

04:57.070 --> 04:58.670
from the highest of ranks.

04:58.672 --> 05:00.572
Oh?

05:00.574 --> 05:02.107
Misters William H. Seward

05:02.109 --> 05:03.875
and Ulysses S. Grant
ordered the attack.

05:03.877 --> 05:06.411
They were the masterminds.

05:06.413 --> 05:10.548
Kennedy, you are
entirely insane.

05:10.550 --> 05:12.217
Or quite crafty.

05:12.219 --> 05:14.319
Now, I stopped by,
not to converse,

05:14.321 --> 05:15.320
but to inform you

05:15.322 --> 05:17.188
that I intend to testify

05:17.190 --> 05:19.391
at your trial and
ensure that you hang!

05:19.393 --> 05:21.793
Lock him up!

05:48.155 --> 05:49.687
Name's Maguire.

05:56.729 --> 05:57.996
Criminy.

05:57.998 --> 05:58.997
Seamus.

05:58.999 --> 06:00.498
Francis Maguire, himself.

06:00.500 --> 06:02.067
Welcome to the druids.

06:02.069 --> 06:03.401
The fake-cash gang.

06:03.403 --> 06:06.204
The higher-ups,
they prefer to call it

06:06.206 --> 06:08.039
a "financial firm".

06:08.041 --> 06:10.542
It's a far cry from your
days at the precinct, eh?

06:10.544 --> 06:12.243
What's the job?

06:12.245 --> 06:14.012
Boodle carrier, same as me.

06:14.014 --> 06:15.380
We take our firm's currency

06:15.382 --> 06:16.748
to merchants around New York,

06:16.750 --> 06:18.116
in exchange for
the real thing...

06:18.118 --> 06:21.619
say 100 of our bills for
5 genuine bank notes.

06:21.621 --> 06:23.121
Those merchants give
their customers

06:23.123 --> 06:24.622
our reproductions as change

06:24.624 --> 06:26.124
and their profits blow up.

06:26.126 --> 06:27.625
It's brilliant, no?

06:27.627 --> 06:29.027
And who runs the ship?

06:29.029 --> 06:30.962
The manager oversees all this.

06:30.964 --> 06:33.865
Above him is the forger.

06:33.867 --> 06:34.933
The master,

06:34.935 --> 06:36.634
he's a true artist,

06:36.636 --> 06:39.637
goddamn Mona Lisa, the
greenbacks he creates.

06:39.639 --> 06:41.139
I thought the Mona Lisa
was a painting,

06:41.141 --> 06:42.640
not an artist.

06:42.642 --> 06:45.844
I was just saying,
the work he does...

06:45.846 --> 06:48.146
how do we get paid?

06:48.148 --> 06:50.348
When we bring back the
merchants' clean cash,

06:50.350 --> 06:52.150
we get a cut.

06:52.152 --> 06:54.219
The druids?

06:54.221 --> 06:56.688
They don't mess around.

06:56.690 --> 06:58.189
Like to them, it's no matter.

06:58.191 --> 07:00.191
A gun, a knife...
they're not weapons,

07:00.193 --> 07:02.894
they're just tools
to get a job done.

07:12.104 --> 07:13.838
When do I start?

07:17.610 --> 07:19.444
You happen to know two brothers

07:19.446 --> 07:20.945
by the name of McGrath?

07:20.947 --> 07:23.314
Yeah, John and Michael.
Yeah, they were in

07:23.316 --> 07:25.049
a few days back,
Wednesday past.

07:25.051 --> 07:27.218
It was an odd night for
the brothers, though.

07:27.220 --> 07:28.686
How do you mean?

07:28.688 --> 07:30.188
Well, when the boys belly
up, they hold their own,

07:30.190 --> 07:31.656
but they were both
lightweights that night.

07:31.658 --> 07:34.058
A couple of drinks,
all was swell.

07:34.060 --> 07:35.627
Then these two gents
bought 'em a third round.

07:35.629 --> 07:37.128
Halfway through their
mugs, the McGraths

07:37.130 --> 07:38.496
nearly dropped to the floor

07:38.498 --> 07:40.398
and those two fellas had
to help the boys home.

07:44.136 --> 07:46.237
Disturbing

07:46.239 --> 07:48.072
my staff, Corky?

07:48.074 --> 07:49.574
I got two brothers,

07:49.576 --> 07:51.576
one dead, one missing.

07:51.578 --> 07:53.144
Growing more likely
this was their last stop

07:53.146 --> 07:54.812
before fate stepped in.

07:54.814 --> 07:57.715
More than one man's spent
his last night here.

07:57.717 --> 07:59.651
Hardly men.

07:59.653 --> 08:01.152
John and Michael McGrath?

08:01.154 --> 08:04.923
Ha! The McGraths.

08:04.925 --> 08:07.592
Admirers of the Creole girls.

08:07.594 --> 08:10.128
They were last seen
here Wednesday.

08:10.130 --> 08:11.863
Did you happen to...?

08:11.865 --> 08:15.934
Um, I was otherwise
engaged that night.

08:17.770 --> 08:20.138
Oh.

08:21.941 --> 08:23.374
We talked with the mother,

08:23.376 --> 08:24.742
but she's a lost soul.

08:24.744 --> 08:26.244
The father, Brogan McGrath,

08:26.246 --> 08:27.612
he's a queer one.

08:27.614 --> 08:30.248
You ever hear the
boys talk of him?

08:30.250 --> 08:32.250
In passing. Far as I know,

08:32.251 --> 08:34.719
I've never met the man myself.

08:34.721 --> 08:36.453
They claim he disappeared

08:36.456 --> 08:39.924
when they were small,
said he headed west,

08:39.926 --> 08:41.426
returned a few months ago,

08:41.428 --> 08:42.927
just after the election, and,

08:42.929 --> 08:44.596
when the boys asked him
where he'd been,

08:44.598 --> 08:46.831
the father said he was in on

08:46.833 --> 08:48.900
the California gold rush.

08:48.902 --> 08:51.269
The gold rush dried up
a decade ago.

08:51.271 --> 08:53.605
Well, the men
in this town are not

08:53.607 --> 08:55.807
necessarily known
for their honesty.

08:55.809 --> 08:57.308
The McGrath brothers
ever say anything

08:57.310 --> 08:59.873
about their dad
being a soldier?

09:01.915 --> 09:03.414
If he had been,

09:03.416 --> 09:05.650
you'd think he would've
told them about that glory,

09:05.652 --> 09:07.318
instead of some tale
about being off,

09:07.320 --> 09:08.820
searching his pot of gold

09:08.822 --> 09:10.755
at the end of the rainbow.

09:10.757 --> 09:11.856
Thanks, Richie.

09:15.794 --> 09:17.895
Those clean?

09:17.897 --> 09:19.931
Yes, ma'am. Let me see.

09:19.933 --> 09:22.634
Check 'em again.

09:22.636 --> 09:25.603
Fake bills are in full sway.

09:25.605 --> 09:26.971
Okay.

09:26.973 --> 09:28.840
What can I get ya?

09:32.343 --> 09:33.776
Looking dapper in
those duds, Maguire.

09:33.778 --> 09:35.177
You present yourself
as high king,

09:35.179 --> 09:36.679
they see you as high king.

09:36.681 --> 09:38.581
You said this was
an uppercrust buyer.

09:38.583 --> 09:40.082
Indeed, it is.

09:40.084 --> 09:41.183
Tare an'ouns.

09:41.185 --> 09:43.185
Nellis is using
fake greenbacks?

09:43.187 --> 09:46.555
Most everyone is.

09:48.024 --> 09:51.227
Best goddamn bakery
in New York. Hmm.

09:53.496 --> 09:56.765
Let's forego
the dance this time

09:56.767 --> 09:59.168
and I'll just ask...

09:59.170 --> 10:00.603
why?

10:00.605 --> 10:02.871
We have built
a lovely life here

10:02.873 --> 10:04.240
in Carmansville.

10:06.376 --> 10:09.678
I made a vow to Dr. Hegel

10:09.680 --> 10:12.748
that I would help
and heal those in need.

10:12.750 --> 10:14.250
Without his presence
in Five Points,

10:14.252 --> 10:16.919
there will be a formidable void

10:16.921 --> 10:19.088
and I can split my time
treating the sick

10:19.090 --> 10:21.290
between Carmansville
and downtown.

10:21.292 --> 10:22.958
Matthew,

10:22.960 --> 10:25.027
you are a remarkable man

10:25.029 --> 10:27.997
and doctor, but you cannot

10:27.999 --> 10:29.632
physically run two
practices by yourself

10:29.634 --> 10:32.101
and I am not about

10:32.103 --> 10:34.203
to go back to the
depths of darkness

10:34.205 --> 10:35.638
to assist you.

10:35.640 --> 10:38.140
I am not asking you
to come with me!

10:44.648 --> 10:48.651
But I have made my decision.

10:48.653 --> 10:50.152
I'm going to take over

10:50.154 --> 10:51.754
Dr. Hegel's Five Points office.

10:59.863 --> 11:01.363
All right, just over there.

11:01.365 --> 11:02.965
Thank you.

11:02.967 --> 11:04.933
Dr. Freeman! Dr. Freeman!

11:04.935 --> 11:06.335
My young'uns are ill.

11:06.337 --> 11:07.836
Their foreheads are afire.

11:07.838 --> 11:10.339
We heard you were back.
Praise the lord!

11:10.341 --> 11:13.776
Come on in. Come on in.

11:13.778 --> 11:16.111
All right, baby,
just sit here now.

11:16.113 --> 11:19.348
Yes, I'm back.

11:19.350 --> 11:23.686
You can't remember one name,

11:23.688 --> 11:25.254
one fella your boys
had trouble with?

11:25.256 --> 11:26.855
Nah, they were friends

11:26.857 --> 11:28.157
with everyone.

11:28.159 --> 11:29.692
No enemies,

11:29.694 --> 11:31.193
no threats, no fights?

11:31.195 --> 11:32.194
Nah.

11:32.196 --> 11:34.530
When's your husband due back?

11:34.532 --> 11:36.498
Hell if I care.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.000
If I'm lucky, Brogan's wrapped

11:38.002 --> 11:40.035
in the wheels of
a rockaway carriage.

11:40.037 --> 11:41.904
Christ, lady.

11:41.906 --> 11:43.005
Mrs. McGrath,

11:43.007 --> 11:44.306
I know you've had
a rough ride recently,

11:44.308 --> 11:47.276
but you should have
a bit more respect

11:47.278 --> 11:48.877
for your husband, after
all he's been through.

11:48.879 --> 11:51.046
What are you going on about?

11:51.048 --> 11:52.781
Him serving his country
in the union army,

11:52.783 --> 11:54.917
same as I did.

11:57.988 --> 12:00.656
You fell for that
line of nonsense?

12:03.427 --> 12:05.994
Ah, you know,

12:05.996 --> 12:09.198
to hell with him,

12:09.200 --> 12:13.535
to hell with this
country, this city.

12:13.537 --> 12:15.037
Nothing but a horror story

12:15.039 --> 12:18.207
since the day we arrived.

12:18.209 --> 12:21.944
Now, it's gone and
taken away me family,

12:21.946 --> 12:25.681
me sons.

12:25.683 --> 12:28.150
A wee taste?

12:28.152 --> 12:31.987
Maybe you should take
a rest from the drink.

12:31.989 --> 12:34.923
Swear to Christ,
it's the only way

12:34.925 --> 12:38.260
I can face not having
me boys near to me.

12:38.262 --> 12:41.063
Besides, I never had much

12:41.065 --> 12:42.765
of a taste for it,
'til I ended up here.

12:45.101 --> 12:48.637
My father used to say

12:48.639 --> 12:50.105
"there's something to be said"

12:50.107 --> 12:52.274
for being with someone
and not feeling

12:52.276 --> 12:54.109
"the need to talk all the time."

12:58.348 --> 12:59.848
Breathe deep for me.

13:07.924 --> 13:09.091
Hmm.

13:12.529 --> 13:17.833
Just sitting together,
or walking in silence.

13:17.835 --> 13:21.103
When Kevin and I
were first courting,

13:21.105 --> 13:26.074
there was a kind of
beauty to the silences,

13:26.076 --> 13:30.312
but not anymore.

13:30.314 --> 13:34.283
Our silences, now,
are filled with blame,

13:34.285 --> 13:38.887
with disgust, and distrust.

13:38.889 --> 13:43.926
Ellen, I...

13:43.928 --> 13:46.962
your focus is
improving greatly.

13:49.098 --> 13:52.401
Kevin sent away all
of Maggie's belongings.

13:52.403 --> 13:56.638
Her toys, her clothing,
everything.

14:07.851 --> 14:08.917
Ellen,

14:08.919 --> 14:11.820
you are suffering greatly.

14:11.822 --> 14:14.389
Both of you are suffering.

14:14.391 --> 14:17.459
While you faced horrors
here at home,

14:17.461 --> 14:19.027
Kevin faced his own horrors

14:19.029 --> 14:20.996
on the battlefield.

14:20.998 --> 14:23.732
To watch his friends die,

14:23.734 --> 14:26.869
to kill men whom
he knew had families,

14:26.871 --> 14:29.938
men not unlike him,

14:29.940 --> 14:31.507
and to barely escape
his own death

14:31.509 --> 14:32.875
when he attempted to desert.

14:34.744 --> 14:37.546
He hasn't told you?

14:49.058 --> 14:52.661
When Kevin received word
that Maggie had died

14:52.663 --> 14:53.962
and that you had...

14:53.964 --> 14:55.030
Disappeared,

14:55.032 --> 14:59.902
he ran away from camp
to find you,

14:59.904 --> 15:03.305
to say goodbye to Maggie,

15:03.307 --> 15:05.507
but he was caught, convicted,

15:05.509 --> 15:08.443
and sentenced to execution.

15:08.445 --> 15:10.579
And Kevin sat in chains,

15:10.581 --> 15:14.116
waiting for death,
talking of you

15:14.118 --> 15:18.153
and your daughter
and of the mistake

15:18.155 --> 15:21.056
he'd made in leaving you here.

15:21.058 --> 15:23.058
Major Morehouse used
his influence

15:23.060 --> 15:25.827
to get Kevin pardoned,

15:25.829 --> 15:29.398
under the condition that
he go back into battle,

15:29.400 --> 15:31.700
all the while, knowing
that his family

15:31.702 --> 15:35.737
had fallen apart.

15:44.080 --> 15:47.482
Brogan.

15:47.484 --> 15:50.485
Detective Corcoran.

15:50.487 --> 15:52.154
Out on the beat, huh?

15:52.156 --> 15:55.457
Off-duty today.
Would you believe it?

15:55.459 --> 15:57.025
Could get used to this life,

15:57.027 --> 15:58.660
maybe take an early
retirement, huh?

16:00.598 --> 16:02.130
Smoke?

16:02.132 --> 16:05.667
Love one.

16:05.669 --> 16:07.069
Just ran into one of the lads

16:07.071 --> 16:08.470
from my old regiment.

16:08.472 --> 16:11.640
Haven't seen him
in over six months.

16:11.642 --> 16:13.475
You know when you...

16:13.477 --> 16:14.643
when you don't see someone

16:14.645 --> 16:17.045
for a long while
but, when you do,

16:17.047 --> 16:18.480
seems like no time has passed?

16:18.482 --> 16:19.581
Oh, sure.

16:19.583 --> 16:20.983
You just pick up
where you left off,

16:20.985 --> 16:22.351
you know what I mean?

16:22.353 --> 16:23.752
It's the same with me

16:23.754 --> 16:26.555
and the fellas I served with.

16:26.557 --> 16:28.056
Maybe it's because of the boys

16:28.058 --> 16:31.093
taking Fort Fisher, but,

16:31.095 --> 16:33.662
I've been reminiscing.

16:33.664 --> 16:37.699
What would you say
you missed most

16:37.701 --> 16:39.468
about being in the army?

16:39.470 --> 16:42.904
Oof. Tough question.

16:42.906 --> 16:45.007
Certainly wasn't
ducking bullets, eh?

16:46.977 --> 16:50.212
If you asked me,
I'd have to say

16:50.214 --> 16:51.213
the camaraderie, you know?

16:51.215 --> 16:53.181
Oh.

16:53.183 --> 16:54.616
Bucking and gagging.

16:54.618 --> 16:55.717
Oh, yes,

16:55.719 --> 16:57.119
the bucking and gagging
got us through

16:57.121 --> 16:58.487
some tough times, to be sure.

16:58.489 --> 17:00.555
Bucking and gagging.

17:00.557 --> 17:02.190
What, you

17:02.192 --> 17:04.760
like having a piece of wood

17:04.762 --> 17:06.261
shoved in your mouth,

17:06.262 --> 17:07.996
your whole body tied
with planks and boards?

17:07.998 --> 17:10.098
For days, you can't move,

17:10.099 --> 17:11.733
can't talk.

17:11.734 --> 17:13.201
That's what you miss
about the union army,

17:13.203 --> 17:14.670
military punishment, torture?!

17:14.672 --> 17:17.439
Hey, I misunderstood! Bullshit!

17:17.441 --> 17:18.940
Your wife was right...
you're nothing but

17:18.942 --> 17:22.010
a goddamn no-good, lying fraud!

17:22.012 --> 17:23.412
Impersonate a soldier?

17:23.414 --> 17:25.079
Sacrilege!

17:25.082 --> 17:28.684
Your sons, your wife,

17:28.686 --> 17:31.153
they deserve better than you. H!

17:31.155 --> 17:32.521
Regarding the ceremony...

17:35.025 --> 17:37.459
I don't understand
what you're saying.

17:37.461 --> 17:38.527
Sorry.

17:40.496 --> 17:41.997
From the book
of common prayer...

17:41.999 --> 17:43.899
speak, pray, preach
what you wish.

17:43.901 --> 17:45.367
It's all the same to me.

17:47.070 --> 17:49.371
Reverend.

17:49.373 --> 17:51.406
You have made this
dress disgusting!

17:51.408 --> 17:52.908
What on earth

17:52.910 --> 17:55.143
could be the cause
of such commotion?!

17:55.145 --> 17:57.779
She dares suggest

17:57.781 --> 18:00.148
changing the pattern.

18:00.150 --> 18:02.217
Sara, what was your suggestion?

18:02.219 --> 18:04.586
Uh,

18:04.588 --> 18:06.755
I thought that, perhaps,

18:06.757 --> 18:08.523
we'd try the lacing

18:08.525 --> 18:10.592
in the front,

18:10.594 --> 18:13.695
from the collar to the hem.

18:15.965 --> 18:18.600
Well, I quite love the idea.

18:18.602 --> 18:22.404
Mrs. Haverford,

18:22.406 --> 18:24.740
this is not a corset,

18:24.742 --> 18:26.174
it is a wedding gown.

18:26.176 --> 18:27.676
Yes, my wedding gown.

18:27.678 --> 18:30.212
And it is your behavior
I find quite disgusting.

18:37.920 --> 18:39.488
Vous allez vous
couvrir de honte,

18:39.490 --> 18:42.224
pas moi.

18:42.226 --> 18:44.226
Sara, your work is
quite lovely.

18:48.164 --> 18:49.564
This evening, Robert
and I are hosting

18:49.566 --> 18:52.667
Mr. Frederick Douglass,
reformer and orator.

18:52.669 --> 18:54.970
He'll be speaking
in our music room.

18:54.972 --> 18:56.171
Please attend.

18:56.173 --> 18:57.839
I think you'll find him
most captivating.

19:02.278 --> 19:05.714
21, 22,

19:05.716 --> 19:10.285
23, 24, 25.

19:10.287 --> 19:11.787
There we are, now.

19:11.789 --> 19:15.357
Your pile's only
waist-high, Hurley.

19:15.359 --> 19:17.859
The deal was 50 of yours
for 500 of ours.

19:17.861 --> 19:18.994
No, no, no, no.

19:18.996 --> 19:21.897
25. It's always been 25.

19:21.899 --> 19:25.066
'Tis not what I was informed.

19:25.068 --> 19:27.302
Seamus?

19:27.304 --> 19:28.904
That's not what we
was informed.

19:28.906 --> 19:32.607
I will pay only 25.

19:32.609 --> 19:35.143
I always pay only 25.

19:35.145 --> 19:36.645
That is final.

19:36.647 --> 19:37.646
Aye.

19:39.715 --> 19:42.284
Well, if you say it's final...

19:44.822 --> 19:46.855
I guess it's final, then.

19:46.857 --> 19:48.356
Hey, those aren't free.

19:57.700 --> 19:59.067
You see, though,

19:59.069 --> 20:00.802
the thing you got to remember

20:00.804 --> 20:03.371
about tobacco...

20:08.511 --> 20:10.712
Is it burns.

20:15.051 --> 20:16.218
Aaah!

20:16.220 --> 20:17.219
Aah!

20:17.221 --> 20:20.856
Aaaaaaah!

20:20.858 --> 20:22.824
Aah! Aah! Aaaaah!

20:41.345 --> 20:42.846
If I come back from Chicago

20:42.848 --> 20:44.747
with $1 million,
say you'll marry me.

20:44.749 --> 20:46.549
I will. You're the best.

20:46.551 --> 20:48.218
I know.

20:51.121 --> 20:52.255
Miss Heissen!

20:52.257 --> 20:56.359
Looking ravishing.

20:56.361 --> 20:59.162
That, I already know,
General Donovan.

20:59.164 --> 21:00.997
Enlighten me with
something I don't.

21:00.999 --> 21:02.498
Have you been introduced

21:02.500 --> 21:04.067
to the table game Faro?

21:04.069 --> 21:05.635
It's a steadfast money-
winner for the house,

21:05.637 --> 21:07.770
and I happen to know a most

21:07.772 --> 21:10.540
trustworthy dealer
who'd be honored

21:10.542 --> 21:13.343
to run the bank for
your establishment.

21:13.345 --> 21:14.844
Let's discuss it further

21:14.846 --> 21:16.346
in your office.

21:29.326 --> 21:31.461
This gentleman here,
mister, um...?

21:31.463 --> 21:34.297
That's the George Becks.

21:34.299 --> 21:35.798
Mr. Becks is

21:35.800 --> 21:37.200
a performer on Broadway.

21:37.202 --> 21:38.635
He's going to give you

21:38.637 --> 21:40.169
a little acting lesson,

21:40.171 --> 21:42.171
help you attracting
the kidnappers.

21:42.173 --> 21:44.607
Okay, but why me?

21:44.609 --> 21:47.844
These kids, they were
all the same type...

21:47.846 --> 21:50.113
strong, 15 to 18 years old,

21:50.115 --> 21:53.049
shitty households,
and they're Irish.

21:53.051 --> 21:55.151
But I'm 27.

21:55.153 --> 21:57.453
You look 16 and you're Irish.

21:57.455 --> 21:58.855
And, when I'm finished
wrapping ya,

21:58.857 --> 22:00.556
you'll at least appear
to be strong.

22:00.558 --> 22:03.159
Let's work on your performance.

22:03.161 --> 22:05.828
Ahem!

22:05.830 --> 22:08.331
Now, watch what I do

22:08.333 --> 22:10.466
and repeat.

22:14.705 --> 22:16.973
Now me mother's gone,

22:16.975 --> 22:18.574
I'm an orphan.

22:18.576 --> 22:20.376
I got no one.

22:20.378 --> 22:22.178
Please buy me a drink, sir?

22:22.180 --> 22:25.281
Now you try.

22:27.351 --> 22:30.887
Okay.

22:30.889 --> 22:32.322
Now that my mother's gone,

22:32.324 --> 22:33.756
I'm an orphan.

22:33.758 --> 22:35.625
Stop, stop.

22:35.627 --> 22:36.926
What is that?

22:36.928 --> 22:38.594
Um, acting?

22:38.596 --> 22:42.565
No, it most certainly
is not. Listen!

22:42.567 --> 22:45.234
Now that me mother is gone,

22:45.236 --> 22:46.903
I'm an orphan. Huh?

22:46.905 --> 22:48.338
You try.

22:48.340 --> 22:50.740
This time, with feeling.

22:50.742 --> 22:53.309
Now that my mother is gone...

22:53.311 --> 22:56.079
oh, my God, you're
just deplorable.

22:56.081 --> 22:58.448
If there is any threat today,

22:58.450 --> 23:00.850
it is to the art of
the theatre.

23:00.852 --> 23:01.918
Once again.

23:01.920 --> 23:05.421
Ahem!

23:05.423 --> 23:07.757
Now that my mother is gone,

23:07.759 --> 23:09.726
I am an orphan.

23:09.728 --> 23:12.428
I have no one
and no home. Please,

23:12.430 --> 23:14.497
buy me a drink,

23:14.499 --> 23:15.631
sir.

23:17.901 --> 23:20.737
Edmund Kean is turning
in his grave.

23:20.739 --> 23:22.538
This amateur is beyond hopeless

23:22.540 --> 23:24.474
and I'm wasting my time.

23:24.476 --> 23:27.210
Good day.

23:27.212 --> 23:29.078
I'll see you out, Mr. Becks.

23:29.080 --> 23:32.548
Ahem.

23:32.550 --> 23:33.616
Good.

23:33.618 --> 23:34.617
Thanks.

23:42.226 --> 23:45.261
I end as I began...

23:45.263 --> 23:49.465
no war but an abolition war;

23:49.467 --> 23:51.634
No peace but
an abolition peace;

23:51.636 --> 23:55.238
Liberty for all,
chains for none!

23:55.240 --> 23:58.875
A black man...
a soldier in war,

23:58.877 --> 24:00.476
a laborer in peace,

24:00.478 --> 24:02.311
a voter at the South
as well as at the north;

24:02.313 --> 24:05.448
America his permanent home,

24:05.450 --> 24:07.550
and all Americans

24:07.552 --> 24:10.820
his fellow countrymen.

24:10.822 --> 24:13.990
This, fellow citizens,

24:13.992 --> 24:17.226
is my idea of
the mission of the war.

24:17.228 --> 24:20.163
If accomplished,

24:20.165 --> 24:24.834
our glory of our nation
will be complete.

24:24.836 --> 24:29.205
Our peace will flow
like a river

24:29.207 --> 24:31.908
and our foundation

24:31.910 --> 24:35.278
will be the everlasting rocks.

24:39.483 --> 24:41.250
Mr. Douglass!

24:43.187 --> 24:44.954
With the thirteenth amendment

24:44.956 --> 24:48.224
in the hands of the
state legislatures,

24:48.226 --> 24:49.625
there is great hope
that your speech

24:49.627 --> 24:51.661
will be one remembered;

24:51.663 --> 24:54.564
And your vision,

24:54.566 --> 24:56.165
one realized.

25:08.679 --> 25:10.947
Find Phinbar. Get him dressed.

25:10.949 --> 25:13.916
We're heading to Eva's
at half-9:00.

25:13.918 --> 25:16.119
Phinbar!

25:17.722 --> 25:21.691
You got a moment, detective?

25:21.693 --> 25:23.092
Please tell me you're not here

25:23.094 --> 25:24.527
to report a missing teenager.

25:24.529 --> 25:27.630
Thank the lord, no, I'm not.

25:27.632 --> 25:31.434
This afternoon,
I stopped by your home

25:31.436 --> 25:33.970
to give Ellen
her regular checkup.

25:33.972 --> 25:35.805
How's she doing?

25:35.807 --> 25:37.573
Motor skills have improved.

25:37.575 --> 25:39.909
Heart rate and lungs
are normal, healthy.

25:39.911 --> 25:41.444
Seems as if she'll make
a full physical recovery.

25:41.446 --> 25:44.347
How's she doing, Matthew?

25:44.349 --> 25:47.350
Her head is clearer,

25:47.352 --> 25:49.018
much clearer.

25:49.020 --> 25:51.120
Full access to logic,

25:51.122 --> 25:53.122
emotions, memories.

25:53.124 --> 25:54.624
She spoke of your past

25:54.626 --> 25:59.695
and your present, together,

25:59.697 --> 26:02.198
Maggie's belongings?

26:02.200 --> 26:05.968
I did what had to be done.

26:05.970 --> 26:07.470
I'm not taking a side.

26:07.472 --> 26:09.939
I'm only telling what we spoke

26:09.941 --> 26:12.975
and I may have made a mistake

26:12.977 --> 26:16.112
and I could've stopped
talking, but I...

26:16.114 --> 26:17.613
probably should have.

26:17.615 --> 26:20.416
I went on and, now,

26:20.418 --> 26:23.386
she knows of your
effort to get home.

26:25.522 --> 26:27.023
I didn't know

26:27.025 --> 26:28.457
she was unaware
of your desertion

26:28.459 --> 26:31.627
and I'm sorry, Kevin.

26:31.629 --> 26:34.263
It's not my story to tell.

26:46.410 --> 26:50.546
Mr. Douglass, I am blessed

26:50.548 --> 26:52.582
with a husband

26:52.584 --> 26:55.117
who cares deeply for me,

26:55.119 --> 26:57.720
as I do him,

26:57.722 --> 27:00.957
but I want to live my own life

27:00.959 --> 27:03.025
and I'm having

27:03.027 --> 27:06.062
an impossible time
reconciling my past.

27:06.064 --> 27:08.464
For many years,

27:08.466 --> 27:10.466
I retained the bitterness

27:10.468 --> 27:12.335
from my days of captivity.

27:14.738 --> 27:19.208
But slowly, over time,

27:19.210 --> 27:21.644
I allowed myself to evolve,

27:21.646 --> 27:25.014
out of necessity.

27:25.016 --> 27:27.316
When the moment is right,

27:27.318 --> 27:28.818
you will embrace the joy

27:28.820 --> 27:32.321
of true freedom.

27:32.323 --> 27:34.056
You will take an action

27:34.058 --> 27:36.626
and then be able

27:36.628 --> 27:38.494
to evolve.

27:43.742 --> 27:45.846
The herald is
running the piece.

27:45.848 --> 27:47.347
Two boys dead,
several more missing...

27:47.349 --> 27:48.849
that's a hell of a story.

27:48.851 --> 27:50.350
I'll not let you
charm or bully me

27:50.352 --> 27:51.718
into burying it.

27:52.053 --> 27:53.586
I like the fact that we're both

27:53.588 --> 27:54.954
in the story business.

27:54.956 --> 27:57.290
People come to me
with stories all day...

27:57.292 --> 28:00.360
widows who lack pensions,
with children to feed;

28:00.362 --> 28:03.696
Working men, unable
to find gainful employ;

28:03.698 --> 28:05.231
Immigrants, scared and alone

28:05.233 --> 28:07.300
in a strange land.

28:07.302 --> 28:09.302
It's my job,

28:09.304 --> 28:12.906
my mission, as it were,

28:12.908 --> 28:16.342
to find a happy ending
to these stories.

28:16.344 --> 28:18.878
Where was it that you

28:18.880 --> 28:20.480
said you were from, again?

28:20.482 --> 28:22.749
You know damn well
where I'm from.

28:22.751 --> 28:25.952
Oh, yes, Pawtucket.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.620
I even happen to have a story

28:27.622 --> 28:29.255
about a man from Pawtucket.

28:29.257 --> 28:31.624
He's a good man,

28:31.626 --> 28:34.727
a staunch protestant,
even helps out

28:34.729 --> 28:36.796
around the chancellery
when the vicar is ill.

28:36.798 --> 28:39.666
He has six adorable children

28:39.668 --> 28:41.401
and a lovely wife.

28:41.403 --> 28:42.769
Does this story have a point?

28:42.771 --> 28:45.672
Every story has a point,

28:45.674 --> 28:47.907
Mr. Coddington,
because, you see,

28:47.909 --> 28:50.543
this man from Pawtucket,
he travels when he works

28:50.545 --> 28:54.213
and, when he does,
he enjoys an activity

28:54.215 --> 28:56.916
for which he
is not known locally

28:56.918 --> 28:58.585
to be an aficionado.

28:58.587 --> 29:00.219
What are you talking about?

29:00.221 --> 29:02.055
Please,

29:02.057 --> 29:03.923
drunk and out of town
don't count, right?

29:03.925 --> 29:06.459
I'll not be lectured on
alcohol by an Irishman.

29:06.461 --> 29:09.629
But this fascination,
obsession,

29:09.631 --> 29:14.100
for negro ladies of the night.

29:17.972 --> 29:21.908
You scheming papist bastard!

29:21.910 --> 29:23.042
No one's going to believe

29:23.044 --> 29:24.644
a bunch of coal-
skinned whores.

29:24.646 --> 29:27.046
Oh, you're right.

29:27.048 --> 29:29.616
You are right. Hmm.

29:29.618 --> 29:32.318
Ah! Which is why...

29:34.222 --> 29:38.925
I have the sworn affidavits

29:38.927 --> 29:40.860
of six hotel managers

29:40.862 --> 29:42.395
and over a dozen chambermaids.

29:42.397 --> 29:43.463
That's unconscionable.

29:43.465 --> 29:45.632
Now, I need your help

29:45.634 --> 29:48.134
finding an end to this story.

29:48.136 --> 29:49.769
Does the man from
Pawtucket agree

29:49.771 --> 29:51.270
not to run the article

29:51.272 --> 29:53.339
on the dead and missing boys,

29:53.341 --> 29:56.442
being that it needlessly
inflames the public

29:56.444 --> 29:58.678
and most likely tips off
the perpetrator,

29:58.680 --> 30:00.346
causing him to skip town,

30:00.348 --> 30:03.149
never to be caught
or convicted;

30:03.151 --> 30:05.618
Or does the man from pawtucket

30:05.620 --> 30:07.620
awake one morning to read about

30:07.622 --> 30:10.056
his predilections
for negro flesh

30:10.058 --> 30:14.060
in the pages of The
Herald's competitors?

30:14.062 --> 30:17.864
Happy ending, or sad?

30:17.866 --> 30:20.500
You choose, Mr. Coddington.

30:29.543 --> 30:32.512
Mr. O'Hearn.

30:32.514 --> 30:33.946
Oh, paddy dear

30:33.948 --> 30:37.417
and did you hear the news
that's goin' round?

30:37.419 --> 30:38.851
the shamrock is
by law forbid

30:38.853 --> 30:40.386
Can I take you upstairs?

30:40.388 --> 30:42.021
Yes.

30:42.023 --> 30:44.524
St. Patrick's day
no more we'll keep

30:44.526 --> 30:46.592
his colours can't be seen

30:46.594 --> 30:48.661
for they passed
a bloody law

30:48.663 --> 30:52.832
against the wearing
of the green

30:52.834 --> 30:54.767
I spoke with napper tandy

30:54.769 --> 30:57.403
and he took me by the hand

30:57.405 --> 30:59.405
he said how's
dear old Ireland

30:59.407 --> 31:02.508
and how does she stand?

31:02.510 --> 31:04.077
she's the most
distressful country

31:04.079 --> 31:06.612
that you have ever seen

31:06.614 --> 31:09.449
Now that my mama's gone,

31:09.451 --> 31:11.417
I'm an orphan.

31:11.419 --> 31:14.053
I got no one and no money.

31:14.055 --> 31:15.154
Buy me a drink, would ya?

31:15.156 --> 31:17.256
Piss off, ya wee scut.

31:17.258 --> 31:19.258
For they're hanging
men and women

31:19.260 --> 31:21.461
for the wearing
of the green

31:21.463 --> 31:24.731
so since the colour
we must wear

31:24.733 --> 31:27.567
is England's cruel red

31:27.569 --> 31:29.836
let it remind us
of the blood

31:29.838 --> 31:32.071
that irishmen have shed

31:32.073 --> 31:34.741
Oh, I've not yet had the chance

31:34.743 --> 31:38.511
to tell you...

31:38.513 --> 31:39.946
I paid a visit

31:39.948 --> 31:42.315
to Robert Cobb Kennedy.

31:42.317 --> 31:43.750
And?

31:43.752 --> 31:45.451
What did you say?

31:45.453 --> 31:46.953
That I would testify
to everything

31:46.955 --> 31:49.388
I witnessed while
in his company.

31:49.390 --> 31:51.924
My words will ensure
that he'll swing.

31:55.963 --> 31:59.632
The man's mind was in shambles.

31:59.634 --> 32:04.203
Or acting as if
that's the case.

32:06.641 --> 32:08.207
Elizabeth.

32:15.015 --> 32:16.449
Sorry, Robert.

32:20.821 --> 32:23.756
So very sorry.

32:23.758 --> 32:26.159
What?

32:26.161 --> 32:28.261
You have nothing
to apologize for.

32:31.265 --> 32:34.233
I don't know.

32:34.235 --> 32:35.735
At times, I think

32:35.737 --> 32:38.838
I should've stayed in England.

32:38.840 --> 32:42.775
You don't know
what you're saying.

32:42.777 --> 32:47.079
You must be exhausted.

32:47.081 --> 32:48.214
The drink and the opium

32:48.216 --> 32:52.485
only exacerbate such tiredness.

32:52.487 --> 32:57.256
You're still fairly
new to its effects.

32:57.258 --> 32:58.791
Rest on my shoulder.

33:14.741 --> 33:17.443
It's foolish, really,

33:17.445 --> 33:21.547
to believe oneself a hero,

33:21.549 --> 33:23.115
to seek fame and ovation

33:23.117 --> 33:29.021
by killing masses
of innocent citizens.

33:29.023 --> 33:30.523
Perhaps "fiendish vanity"

33:30.525 --> 33:33.092
is a more appropriate phrase.

33:38.599 --> 33:43.469
We'll be there, Elizabeth.

33:43.471 --> 33:46.038
We'll be there on
the day that he hangs.

33:52.579 --> 33:55.848
avenging and bright falls

33:55.850 --> 33:59.385
the swift sword of Erin

33:59.387 --> 34:04.056
on him who the brave sons

34:04.058 --> 34:06.192
of usna betray'd

34:06.194 --> 34:08.628
for every fond eye

34:08.630 --> 34:10.228
he hath waken'd a tear in

34:10.231 --> 34:13.132
Beer.

34:13.134 --> 34:16.101
A drop from
his heart-wounds

34:16.103 --> 34:18.137
Hey, mister.

34:18.139 --> 34:19.672
Shall weep o'er her blade

34:19.674 --> 34:20.672
Ahem.

34:20.675 --> 34:23.676
Now that my mama's
go, I'm an orphan.

34:23.678 --> 34:25.244
I got no one,

34:25.246 --> 34:26.445
no money.

34:26.447 --> 34:28.179
Buy me a drink,
would you, mister?

34:28.181 --> 34:30.616
Here you go.

34:30.618 --> 34:32.485
Thanks. Just one?

34:32.487 --> 34:34.853
Lie sleeping

34:34.856 --> 34:36.455
n Gore

34:36.456 --> 34:39.859
by the billows of war

34:39.860 --> 34:43.362
which so often,
high swelling

34:43.364 --> 34:45.864
have wafted these heroes

34:45.867 --> 34:47.600
to victory's shore

34:47.601 --> 34:48.601
evening.

34:48.603 --> 34:52.204
Seems your mug's about empty.

34:52.206 --> 34:54.373
How about a drink, on me?

34:54.375 --> 34:56.108
Sure, mister.

34:56.110 --> 34:58.344
Beer.

34:58.346 --> 35:00.346
10 cents for the 2 of 'em.

35:00.348 --> 35:01.480
Thank you much.

35:01.482 --> 35:03.349
From around these parts?

35:03.351 --> 35:04.850
No.

35:04.852 --> 35:08.421
How old are you, kid?

35:08.423 --> 35:10.256
19.

35:10.258 --> 35:14.193
Thanks. For you.

35:14.195 --> 35:16.862
Till vengeance is wreak'd

35:16.864 --> 35:19.932
O'Reilly! I've been
looking for you!

35:19.934 --> 35:22.134
Where's my money?!

35:22.136 --> 35:24.637
Come on, boys.
Oh, here it comes.

35:24.639 --> 35:25.938
Here it comes!

35:25.940 --> 35:27.807
Oh, no!

35:35.515 --> 35:37.717
You don't want that.

35:37.719 --> 35:40.319
Hit 'im! Yeah! Arr! Hit 'im!

35:40.321 --> 35:42.121
Move!

35:42.123 --> 35:43.723
Yeah! Yeah!

35:43.725 --> 35:45.992
Come on! Come on! Come on.

35:45.994 --> 35:47.393
Against the wall!

35:47.395 --> 35:48.794
Who the hell are you?!

35:48.796 --> 35:50.162
Who the hell are you?!

35:50.164 --> 35:51.664
I'm a copper, you blowhard!

35:51.666 --> 35:53.199
I'm just a fella
grabbing a beer.

35:53.201 --> 35:55.401
What's this about?

35:55.403 --> 35:57.903
Oh, yeah? Get up!

35:57.905 --> 35:59.972
It's about murder.

35:59.974 --> 36:01.574
Two dead boys.

36:05.345 --> 36:06.612
Hit 'im!

36:06.614 --> 36:08.914
You goddamn thief!

36:11.585 --> 36:13.452
Yeah!

36:15.468 --> 36:16.869
The man's name is Tim Doman,

36:16.871 --> 36:18.304
according to one
of Eva's ladies.

36:18.306 --> 36:20.673
Sullivan's got patrolmen
searching the city over.

36:20.675 --> 36:22.274
Doman'll be in irons
by tomorrow.

36:22.276 --> 36:23.776
We'll find those missing boys.

36:23.778 --> 36:26.111
So what now?

36:26.113 --> 36:28.814
Home. I'm going home.

36:32.118 --> 36:33.619
We handpicked you,

36:33.621 --> 36:35.754
weeks after becoming a widow.

36:35.756 --> 36:37.056
I sat beside you,

36:37.058 --> 36:38.557
in that lavish drawing
room of yours, as you

36:38.559 --> 36:41.126
agreed to lucrative
Southern cotton contracts

36:41.128 --> 36:43.595
in exchange for investing

36:43.597 --> 36:45.097
nearly every cent you had left

36:45.099 --> 36:47.433
in our plot,

36:47.435 --> 36:49.234
all of it to preserve
your pitiful dream

36:49.236 --> 36:51.737
of remaining a member
of that upper class

36:51.739 --> 36:53.238
to which you
so desperately cling!

36:53.240 --> 36:57.276
My involvement was meant
to bring peace

36:57.278 --> 37:01.714
and, yes, I admit,
increase my wealth.

37:03.249 --> 37:05.351
Just tell me true...

37:05.353 --> 37:07.853
do you intend to tell
the authorities

37:07.855 --> 37:10.522
of my involvement?

37:10.524 --> 37:13.926
Well, that depends.

37:17.331 --> 37:19.131
Oh, do you hear that?

37:19.133 --> 37:20.766
It's like one of
them goddamn seals

37:20.768 --> 37:22.634
barking down at the docks.

37:22.636 --> 37:24.403
Your epiglottis is inflamed...

37:24.405 --> 37:26.772
the back of your throat...

37:26.774 --> 37:28.540
and your lungs are congested.

37:28.542 --> 37:30.576
That's why you're
coughing in that way.

37:30.578 --> 37:32.011
Am I dying?

37:32.013 --> 37:33.445
No, you'll be fine.

37:33.447 --> 37:35.881
You have what's called "croup".

37:35.883 --> 37:37.349
I'm going to give
you some thyme...

37:37.351 --> 37:38.784
it's an herb.

37:38.786 --> 37:40.919
Do you know how to make tea?

37:40.921 --> 37:43.355
I'm Irish, ain't I?

37:43.357 --> 37:44.857
Yes, you are.

37:47.193 --> 37:48.694
Use these leaves

37:48.696 --> 37:50.696
to make fresh tea
three times a day.

37:50.698 --> 37:54.133
Within a week, your
cough will subside.

37:54.135 --> 37:56.135
I, uh...

37:56.137 --> 37:57.669
Oh, thanks, now.

37:57.671 --> 37:59.838
But would you mind
not telling anyone

37:59.840 --> 38:01.974
that I saw a nigger?

38:01.976 --> 38:04.610
I mean, a negro doctor.

38:19.259 --> 38:22.061
Maggie's things...

38:22.063 --> 38:23.862
you see,

38:23.864 --> 38:26.365
if there's a problem, I act.

38:26.367 --> 38:28.934
I try to fix it.

38:28.936 --> 38:31.904
That's just the way I am.

38:31.906 --> 38:35.374
But if, in trying
to help, I hurt you,

38:35.376 --> 38:38.177
then I'm... I'm sorry.

38:48.121 --> 38:51.356
Sara! What are you...?

38:51.358 --> 38:53.625
Did you travel all
this way on your own?

38:53.627 --> 38:54.893
No.

38:56.729 --> 38:58.697
Mr. Monroe and his brother

38:58.699 --> 39:00.699
kindly drove me
in their carriage.

39:06.272 --> 39:07.706
Sit.

39:11.978 --> 39:13.846
You've only just
opened this office

39:13.848 --> 39:16.081
and, already, you spend all

39:16.083 --> 39:17.583
of your time here, working.

39:17.585 --> 39:22.621
You don't eat. You don't sleep.

39:22.623 --> 39:23.722
This isn't healthy for you,

39:23.724 --> 39:26.058
Matthew,

39:26.060 --> 39:27.559
or for us.

39:27.561 --> 39:32.030
To be honest,

39:32.032 --> 39:34.366
I don't know where we are...

39:34.368 --> 39:37.302
in life, in marriage,

39:37.304 --> 39:38.904
in mourning.

39:45.512 --> 39:48.881
It's time for me to

39:48.883 --> 39:52.484
evolve.

39:52.486 --> 39:54.153
I now know things about myself

39:54.155 --> 39:57.256
that I've never known before.

39:57.258 --> 39:59.958
We were to have a child

39:59.960 --> 40:02.327
and I was to be a mother,

40:02.329 --> 40:04.463
a strong mother,

40:04.465 --> 40:07.399
but it wasn't the lord's will.

40:07.401 --> 40:09.434
Instead,

40:09.436 --> 40:12.938
I will be a strong wife,

40:12.940 --> 40:16.441
a strong woman.

40:16.443 --> 40:18.544
If this is where life
has brought us, Matthew,

40:18.546 --> 40:24.149
then I will accept
and embrace it.

40:24.151 --> 40:28.620
I want to help you help people

40:28.622 --> 40:31.690
b-because

40:31.692 --> 40:33.759
I want you.

41:08.429 --> 41:09.861
Ooh ooh

41:09.863 --> 41:12.664
ooh ooh ooh

41:14.501 --> 41:16.268
ooh ooh

41:16.270 --> 41:17.569
ooh

41:17.571 --> 41:18.637
ooh ooh

41:19.707 --> 41:21.373
the truth

41:21.375 --> 41:22.941
will ever hide

41:24.545 --> 41:28.580
Even though I tried

41:28.582 --> 41:30.449
they tried

41:30.451 --> 41:32.951
to take my pride

41:32.953 --> 41:35.520
but they only took

41:35.522 --> 41:38.523
my father from me

41:40.261 --> 41:42.227
They only took

41:42.229 --> 41:45.297
my father

41:45.299 --> 41:47.199
even though

41:47.201 --> 41:49.568
I cried

41:49.570 --> 41:53.839
even though I tried

41:53.841 --> 41:58.143
again

42:02.915 --> 42:04.583
God be with you

42:04.585 --> 42:10.522
Ireland

42:10.524 --> 42:12.858
God be with you

42:12.860 --> 42:15.694
Ireland

42:23.337 --> 42:26.038
sometimes I was

42:26.040 --> 42:27.306
afraid

42:27.308 --> 42:31.109
even though I prayed

42:31.111 --> 42:35.747
I've lost my religion now

42:35.749 --> 42:39.918
you took that, too, somehow

42:39.920 --> 42:44.022
blood upon thy hands

42:44.024 --> 42:48.226
blood upon thy hands

42:48.228 --> 42:52.297
again

42:52.299 --> 42:56.335
I have served my time

42:56.337 --> 42:58.670
God be with you

42:58.672 --> 43:00.672
Ireland

43:00.674 --> 43:03.175
the only way I'd ever trust
a fellow like you is

43:03.177 --> 43:04.576
if you took out one
of your own.

43:04.578 --> 43:05.944
You'll have to kill a copper.

43:05.946 --> 43:08.146
So how did the McGrath
boys end up dead?

43:08.148 --> 43:10.749
Hit him again. Go.

43:10.751 --> 43:12.984
I did what I thought was best.

43:12.986 --> 43:14.252
For you. For our daughter.

43:14.254 --> 43:15.987
And, yet, the house is empty.

43:17.157 --> 43:18.657
How do I help you turn
around and face it?

43:18.659 --> 43:20.492
You don't.

43:20.494 --> 43:22.594
Sara!

43:22.596 --> 43:24.663
Congratulations
on your wedding day,

43:24.665 --> 43:26.031
Mrs. Haverford.

43:26.033 --> 43:28.567
Any final words before
we take the plunge?
