WEBVTT

00:02.085 --> 00:03.879
(singing)

00:03.921 --> 00:06.757
(talking baby talk)

00:07.508 --> 00:09.927
(talking baby talk)

00:11.094 --> 00:13.597
(both talking baby talk)

00:14.723 --> 00:17.017
(all talking baby talk)

00:25.108 --> 00:27.068
Do you think babies dream?

00:27.110 --> 00:30.531
♪ Life is unfair. ♪

00:34.117 --> 00:35.828
(playing classical piece)

00:39.164 --> 00:41.333
Oh, Jamie finally

00:39.164 --> 00:41.333
fell asleep.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.794
Haven't you finished

00:41.375 --> 00:43.794
paying these bills yet?

00:43.836 --> 00:45.086
How am I supposed

00:43.836 --> 00:45.086
to know

00:45.128 --> 00:46.588
which ones

00:45.128 --> 00:46.588
to blow off?

00:46.630 --> 00:47.715
"Ultimate

00:46.630 --> 00:47.715
Final Notice"

00:47.756 --> 00:48.716
is obviously

00:47.756 --> 00:48.716
more serious

00:48.757 --> 00:50.091
than "Absolute

00:48.757 --> 00:50.091
Final Notice,"

00:50.133 --> 00:51.719
but pink is angrier

00:50.133 --> 00:51.719
than yellow,

00:51.760 --> 00:53.971
and this one's still

00:51.760 --> 00:53.971
saying, "Please."

00:54.013 --> 00:54.972
Would someone

00:54.013 --> 00:54.972
get my

00:55.014 --> 00:56.390
calculator

00:55.014 --> 00:56.390
out of the car?

00:56.431 --> 00:57.474
I'll get it.

00:57.516 --> 00:58.392
I'll go with you.

00:58.433 --> 00:59.768
That's Beth,

00:59.810 --> 01:01.478
Reese's girlfriend

00:59.810 --> 01:01.478
for the last month.

01:01.520 --> 01:03.355
She's really starting to bug me.

01:03.397 --> 01:06.107
First I had to hear them

01:03.397 --> 01:06.107
through their baby-talk phase.

01:06.149 --> 01:08.569
Then they had their

01:06.149 --> 01:08.569
giggling phone call phase.

01:08.610 --> 01:11.112
Now they're on their

01:08.610 --> 01:11.112
endless making-out phase.

01:11.154 --> 01:13.323
It's gotten to the point

01:11.154 --> 01:13.323
where I can't tell

01:13.365 --> 01:15.534
if they're kissing

01:13.365 --> 01:15.534
or cleaning each other.

01:15.576 --> 01:16.535
Well, forget

01:15.576 --> 01:16.535
this one.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.119
What's the vet

01:16.577 --> 01:18.119
going to do?

01:18.161 --> 01:19.997
Bring Dewey's bird

01:18.161 --> 01:19.997
back to life?

01:20.039 --> 01:21.582
The Feds arrested

01:20.039 --> 01:21.582
Morrison today.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.375
He locked himself

01:21.623 --> 01:23.375
in the supply cabinet

01:23.417 --> 01:25.168
and they just carried

01:23.417 --> 01:25.168
the whole thing out.

01:25.210 --> 01:27.838
God, haven't they finished

01:25.210 --> 01:27.838
arresting people yet?

01:27.880 --> 01:30.841
Dewey, could you please

01:27.880 --> 01:30.841
not do that right now?

01:30.883 --> 01:32.927
Look, I need to have

01:30.883 --> 01:32.927
both the Debussy

01:32.968 --> 01:35.387
and the Ravel nailed

01:32.968 --> 01:35.387
by tomorrow morning.

01:35.429 --> 01:37.848
The selection committee

01:35.429 --> 01:37.848
for the youth music festival

01:37.890 --> 01:40.141
won't be impressed

01:37.890 --> 01:40.141
with simple etudes.

01:40.183 --> 01:41.769
What?

01:41.810 --> 01:43.144
I'm just sharing my day.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.188
Thanks for taking an interest.

01:45.230 --> 01:47.232
Okay,

01:45.230 --> 01:47.232
we'll be studying.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.358
HAL:

01:47.274 --> 01:48.358
Wait, where's

01:48.400 --> 01:49.359
my calculator?

01:49.401 --> 01:50.318
Oh.

01:50.360 --> 01:51.612
I'll get it.

01:51.653 --> 01:52.654
I'll go with you.

01:56.199 --> 01:59.536
(whistling)

01:59.578 --> 02:00.955
MAN:

01:59.578 --> 02:00.955
Buckle up.

02:00.996 --> 02:02.205
(shrieks)

02:02.247 --> 02:04.165
I'm Agent Stone.

02:02.247 --> 02:04.165
This is Agent Scurry.

02:04.207 --> 02:05.166
We're from the FBI.

02:05.208 --> 02:06.167
I thought it was

02:05.208 --> 02:06.167
just a squirrel.

02:06.209 --> 02:08.169
That's why I kept going.

02:08.211 --> 02:10.213
God, if I could have that day

02:08.211 --> 02:10.213
back, I would give anything...

02:10.255 --> 02:11.256
Sir, this is about

02:11.298 --> 02:12.466
the company

02:11.298 --> 02:12.466
you work for.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.593
In the last eight months

02:14.635 --> 02:16.261
we've filed 230

02:14.635 --> 02:16.261
criminal indictments.

02:16.303 --> 02:18.179
People are flying

02:16.303 --> 02:18.179
into jail cells.

02:18.221 --> 02:19.180
It's beautiful.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.057
Except for

02:20.099 --> 02:21.558
your department.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.644
But we're just about ready

02:21.600 --> 02:23.644
to pounce on Ken Wixted.

02:23.685 --> 02:24.853
Ken Wixted?

02:24.895 --> 02:26.229
We've got him dead-to-rights.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.229
We just need you

02:26.271 --> 02:27.355
to confirm a couple

02:26.271 --> 02:27.355
of key details.

02:27.397 --> 02:28.482
Did you ever

02:27.397 --> 02:28.482
see Ken Wixted

02:28.523 --> 02:30.985
change the numbers on

02:28.523 --> 02:30.985
a Section 13B filing

02:31.026 --> 02:33.278
after it was signed by

02:31.026 --> 02:33.278
the company auditors?

02:33.320 --> 02:35.196
What? No.

02:35.238 --> 02:36.824
Did he ever mention,

02:35.238 --> 02:36.824
maybe in passing,

02:36.865 --> 02:38.199
anything about

02:36.865 --> 02:38.199
an offshore account

02:38.241 --> 02:39.827
in the Cayman Islands,

02:38.241 --> 02:39.827
or a villa?

02:39.868 --> 02:40.869
Anything about a villa?

02:40.911 --> 02:41.662
I don't think so.

02:41.703 --> 02:42.621
Hal, we really,

02:42.663 --> 02:45.206
really need you

02:42.663 --> 02:45.206
to search your memory.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.626
Think hard about whether

02:45.248 --> 02:47.626
you're remembering right,

02:47.668 --> 02:50.211
or whether you should

02:47.668 --> 02:50.211
change your answer to yes.

02:50.253 --> 02:52.213
Do you want me to lie?

02:52.255 --> 02:54.091
We're just asking if

02:52.255 --> 02:54.091
you'd like to confirm

02:54.133 --> 02:55.216
what everybody already knows,

02:55.258 --> 02:57.218
or whether you'd like

02:55.258 --> 02:57.218
to provoke the full fury

02:57.260 --> 02:58.804
of the United

02:57.260 --> 02:58.804
States government.

02:58.846 --> 03:00.139
Now, can you

02:58.846 --> 03:00.139
swing by

03:00.179 --> 03:01.431
my kid's school?

03:01.473 --> 03:03.934
I forgot to give

03:01.473 --> 03:03.934
him his lunch.

03:06.520 --> 03:08.229
Beth.

03:10.273 --> 03:11.859
Are your parents

03:10.273 --> 03:11.859
passed out yet?

03:11.900 --> 03:13.234
Yeah, but what

03:11.900 --> 03:13.234
are you doing?

03:13.276 --> 03:14.235
I thought you

03:14.277 --> 03:15.236
were working late.

03:15.278 --> 03:16.446
Why are you dressed like that?

03:16.488 --> 03:18.073
Because I've been

03:16.488 --> 03:18.073
thinking about

03:18.115 --> 03:19.240
this moment

03:18.115 --> 03:19.240
for a long time,

03:19.282 --> 03:20.534
and I want it

03:19.282 --> 03:20.534
to be perfect.

03:20.575 --> 03:23.537
Beth, I have something

03:20.575 --> 03:23.537
to tell you.

03:25.497 --> 03:28.291
Beth... I love you.

03:28.333 --> 03:31.545
I love you.

03:32.587 --> 03:34.506
Oh, God.

03:34.548 --> 03:36.257
This is going to be

03:34.548 --> 03:36.257
so horrible for you.

03:36.299 --> 03:38.259
I am so sorry.

03:38.301 --> 03:39.094
What do you mean?

03:39.136 --> 03:41.262
I want to break up.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.015
Oh.

03:44.141 --> 03:47.561
Yeah, yeah, that's okay.

03:47.602 --> 03:48.770
Yeah, that's fine.

03:48.812 --> 03:49.688
You know,

03:49.730 --> 03:51.356
I was just kidding

03:51.398 --> 03:53.483
anyway about... yeah.

03:53.525 --> 03:54.526
It's no biggie.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.112
(violin playing)

03:57.154 --> 03:58.113
Look, Reese.

03:58.155 --> 03:58.864
It's not you,

03:58.906 --> 03:59.948
it's me.

03:59.990 --> 04:01.366
I just think I can do better.

04:01.408 --> 04:04.870
I think we should end it now

04:01.408 --> 04:04.870
before things get even...

04:04.912 --> 04:06.580
Can we stop that music?

04:15.338 --> 04:17.132
I should go.

04:17.174 --> 04:18.466
Reese, if

04:17.174 --> 04:18.466
I could make

04:18.508 --> 04:21.803
myself like you, I would.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.807
What's that?

04:27.350 --> 04:29.310
Reese, stop, you're going

04:27.350 --> 04:29.310
to wake up my parents.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.646
You really don't want to

04:29.352 --> 04:31.646
do this. It's not what...

04:32.856 --> 04:34.775
She grew on me.

04:34.816 --> 04:35.984
Please don't kill me.

04:36.026 --> 04:37.318
You can break

04:36.026 --> 04:37.318
my fingers.

04:37.360 --> 04:38.779
Or if you just

04:37.360 --> 04:38.779
want to rest,

04:38.820 --> 04:40.280
I'll break them for you.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.576
I just want you

04:42.365 --> 04:44.576
to be happy.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.709
Wow, I thought there'd

04:50.373 --> 04:52.709
be a huge fistfight.

04:52.751 --> 04:54.544
I mean, I had no

04:52.751 --> 04:54.544
right to expect it,

04:54.586 --> 04:56.171
but I would

04:54.586 --> 04:56.171
have understood.

04:56.213 --> 05:00.008
(horse neighing)

05:00.050 --> 05:01.342
LOIS:

05:00.050 --> 05:01.342
They want you

05:01.384 --> 05:02.343
to lie?

05:02.385 --> 05:03.553
They never said that exactly.

05:03.595 --> 05:05.346
Well, the big guy

05:03.595 --> 05:05.346
never said anything.

05:05.388 --> 05:06.807
These guys are

05:05.388 --> 05:06.807
serious, Lois.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.058
And they're

05:06.848 --> 05:08.058
everywhere.

05:08.100 --> 05:09.143
It's scary.

05:09.184 --> 05:10.351
Well, I aced my audition.

05:10.393 --> 05:12.271
They're sending me

05:10.393 --> 05:12.271
to the state finals.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.730
So now I just need

05:12.312 --> 05:13.730
to tell them how many

05:13.772 --> 05:15.356
family members are coming.

05:15.398 --> 05:17.818
Dewey, we're in the middle

05:15.398 --> 05:17.818
of something important here.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.778
So that's me and everybody

05:17.859 --> 05:19.778
who cares about me.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.155
One.

05:21.196 --> 05:23.198
Do you believe the way

05:21.196 --> 05:23.198
these guys operate?

05:23.240 --> 05:25.159
They find some

05:23.240 --> 05:25.159
weak little patsy

05:25.200 --> 05:26.994
they're sure's going to crack

05:25.200 --> 05:26.994
under the slightest pressure

05:27.035 --> 05:29.037
just so they don't have

05:27.035 --> 05:29.037
to do their own legwork.

05:29.079 --> 05:31.248
I'm embarrassed

05:29.079 --> 05:31.248
for both of us.

05:31.290 --> 05:32.415
Well, this

05:31.290 --> 05:32.415
is America, Hal.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.375
You are not going

05:32.457 --> 05:34.375
to lie to put someone

05:34.417 --> 05:35.794
in jail who might

05:34.417 --> 05:35.794
be innocent.

05:35.836 --> 05:37.212
You are right,

05:35.836 --> 05:37.212
and you know what?

05:37.254 --> 05:38.839
I'm going to tell

05:37.254 --> 05:38.839
them that right now.

05:42.425 --> 05:44.803
(car drives off)

05:50.142 --> 05:51.643
You've taken my arms

05:50.142 --> 05:51.643
and legs.

05:51.685 --> 05:52.978
What else do you want?

05:53.020 --> 05:55.563
I want your eyeballs

05:53.020 --> 05:55.563
for my chocolate sundae.

05:55.605 --> 05:56.815
But I'll be blind,

05:56.857 --> 05:59.358
and your sundae will only taste

05:56.857 --> 05:59.358
a little bit better.

06:00.819 --> 06:01.736
(screaming)

06:04.447 --> 06:06.407
I'm the worst brother ever!

06:06.449 --> 06:07.701
DEWEY:

06:06.449 --> 06:07.701
Malcolm, Malcolm.

06:07.742 --> 06:09.452
Wake up!

06:07.742 --> 06:09.452
Reese is gone.

06:09.494 --> 06:12.706
What? Where'd he go?

06:09.494 --> 06:12.706
The note didn't say.

06:12.747 --> 06:15.083
"If my own brother could

06:12.747 --> 06:15.083
stab me through the heart..."

06:15.125 --> 06:16.043
Blah, blah, blah...

06:16.084 --> 06:16.877
"Teardrops..."

06:16.918 --> 06:17.878
Blah, blah, blah...

06:17.919 --> 06:19.296
"Good-bye forever."

06:19.338 --> 06:20.421
Look.

06:20.463 --> 06:21.715
Mom and Dad

06:20.463 --> 06:21.715
are going to make

06:21.756 --> 06:24.051
a big deal out of this.

06:21.756 --> 06:24.051
Let's just sit on it

06:24.092 --> 06:26.427
till I get an answer

06:24.092 --> 06:26.427
about my music festival.

06:26.469 --> 06:28.638
(Hal and Lois shouting)

06:28.680 --> 06:30.431
What's happening?

06:28.680 --> 06:30.431
What are you doing?

06:30.473 --> 06:32.017
Wixted rolled

06:30.473 --> 06:32.017
over on you, Hal.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.434
He told us all about

06:32.059 --> 06:33.434
your offshore accounts

06:33.476 --> 06:34.895
in the Cayman Islands,

06:34.936 --> 06:37.272
altering documents,

06:34.936 --> 06:37.272
the villa, everything.

06:37.314 --> 06:38.857
Can't he at least

06:37.314 --> 06:38.857
put some pants on?

06:38.899 --> 06:40.441
Just as soon

06:38.899 --> 06:40.441
as we get a good

06:40.483 --> 06:41.860
perp-walk

06:40.483 --> 06:41.860
out of him.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.070
This is

06:41.902 --> 06:43.070
ridiculous!

06:43.111 --> 06:44.238
He doesn't belong

06:43.111 --> 06:44.238
in jail!

06:44.279 --> 06:45.446
He doesn't even look in the back

06:45.488 --> 06:47.074
of the  TV Guide

06:45.488 --> 06:47.074
for the crossword answers!

06:47.115 --> 06:48.075
Honey, I love you.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.034
Keep the phone bill paid

06:49.076 --> 06:50.369
so I can call you.

06:50.409 --> 06:51.661
And the trick

06:50.409 --> 06:51.661
to the thermostat

06:51.703 --> 06:53.454
is to push in

06:51.703 --> 06:53.454
before you twist it.

06:53.496 --> 06:54.706
Sir, you need

06:53.496 --> 06:54.706
to stand still.

06:54.748 --> 06:55.749
And I need a lawyer.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.458
Not Reese's.

06:55.790 --> 06:57.458
I-I want a good one.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.460
Sir, you need

06:57.500 --> 06:59.460
to stop squirming.

06:59.502 --> 07:00.921
Boys, go back in the house.

07:00.962 --> 07:02.714
Boys, your daddy

07:00.962 --> 07:02.714
loves you very much.

07:02.756 --> 07:03.965
And don't worry about this.

07:04.007 --> 07:05.259
Sir, this

07:04.007 --> 07:05.259
is your last warning.

07:05.300 --> 07:06.260
Believe in the American

07:06.301 --> 07:08.303
(electric zap)

07:06.301 --> 07:08.303
Justice Sys...

07:09.012 --> 07:10.764
(cameras clicking)

07:14.601 --> 07:16.477
I guess Dad's a no.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.488
Don't worry, Hal.

07:27.530 --> 07:29.199
I will be there

07:27.530 --> 07:29.199
first thing in the morning.

07:29.241 --> 07:31.492
Yes, I will bring your shaving

07:29.241 --> 07:31.492
cream and your toothbrush.

07:31.534 --> 07:35.080
No, Hal, do not make

07:31.534 --> 07:35.080
a break for it.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.873
Say it back to me.

07:36.915 --> 07:39.500
Okay. I love you.

07:39.542 --> 07:40.752
That's not evidence!

07:40.794 --> 07:42.337
Those are my birth

07:40.794 --> 07:42.337
control pills!

07:42.379 --> 07:43.380
I brought them with me!

07:43.422 --> 07:44.505
The beagle made a pointy foot.

07:44.547 --> 07:45.590
It's out of my hands, lady.

07:45.632 --> 07:46.967
What the hell is

07:45.632 --> 07:46.967
wrong with you?

07:47.592 --> 07:49.136
At least leave me one.

07:49.177 --> 07:51.305
Francis, don't make any more

07:49.177 --> 07:51.305
trouble than we already have.

07:51.346 --> 07:54.099
And you do not

07:51.346 --> 07:54.099
have a warrant to

07:51.346 --> 07:54.099
vandalize our house!

07:54.141 --> 07:56.517
When this is all

07:54.141 --> 07:56.517
over, you are going

07:54.141 --> 07:56.517
to be chalking tires

07:56.559 --> 07:58.519
all the way from

07:56.559 --> 07:58.519
here to Montreal!

07:58.561 --> 08:00.605
Don't you threaten me, lady.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.523
(all shouting over each other)

08:02.565 --> 08:05.568
♪ ♪

08:09.030 --> 08:11.616
...with both hands

08:09.030 --> 08:11.616
and a flashlight!

08:11.658 --> 08:13.076
(door closes)

08:13.660 --> 08:14.953
Okay.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.621
The lawyer's supposed

08:14.995 --> 08:16.621
to meet me here at 7:00.

08:16.663 --> 08:18.539
If I'm late, feed

08:16.663 --> 08:18.539
him something,

08:18.581 --> 08:19.540
but not the tuna casserole.

08:19.582 --> 08:20.959
That has to last for

08:19.582 --> 08:20.959
the next four days.

08:21.001 --> 08:24.379
Hopefully, by that time,

08:21.001 --> 08:24.379
your father will...

08:24.421 --> 08:26.840
Somebody better do those dishes.

08:26.881 --> 08:27.841
Mom, don't worry.

08:27.882 --> 08:29.134
Just do what

08:27.882 --> 08:29.134
you have to do.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.635
We'll look after the house.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.635
I have to go.

08:30.677 --> 08:32.429
Don't let me

08:30.677 --> 08:32.429
forget to get

08:32.471 --> 08:33.554
your father's allergy medication

08:33.596 --> 08:34.806
and pick up his suit

08:33.596 --> 08:34.806
for the hearing.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.433
You want me to

08:34.848 --> 08:36.433
do anything?

08:36.475 --> 08:38.435
Well, you could steal

08:36.475 --> 08:38.435
your brother's girlfriend.

08:38.477 --> 08:39.560
Oh, wait,

08:38.477 --> 08:39.560
you already did that.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.229
I know what I

08:39.602 --> 08:41.229
did was awful.

08:41.271 --> 08:43.023
Believe me, I know,

08:43.064 --> 08:44.358
and I don't even

08:43.064 --> 08:44.358
want forgiveness,

08:44.399 --> 08:46.276
but I think if you all

08:44.399 --> 08:46.276
just give me a chance,

08:46.318 --> 08:48.569
I can prove that I'm a

08:46.318 --> 08:48.569
better person than this.

08:48.611 --> 08:50.613
My eyes are up here.

08:52.615 --> 08:55.576
I'm just going to have to find

08:52.615 --> 08:55.576
Reese, that's all.

08:55.618 --> 08:57.412
It shouldn't be too hard.

08:57.454 --> 08:59.039
Where's he going to go, anyway?

08:59.080 --> 09:01.582
MAN:

08:59.080 --> 09:01.582
Welcome to the U.S. Army,

09:01.624 --> 09:03.960
your home

09:01.624 --> 09:03.960
for the next three years.

09:04.002 --> 09:06.587
You will proceed single-file

09:04.002 --> 09:06.587
on the yellow stripe

09:06.629 --> 09:08.423
to the processing facility.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.800
Do not overwork

09:08.465 --> 09:10.800
your tiny little brains

09:10.842 --> 09:14.012
trying to figure out

09:10.842 --> 09:14.012
what the other stripes are for.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.056
Now move!

09:23.063 --> 09:24.231
Not good enough?

09:24.272 --> 09:25.648
I'm good enough for this place.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.612
Hold it!

09:31.654 --> 09:33.407
Are you sure you're 18?

09:33.448 --> 09:36.617
Got the driver's license

09:33.448 --> 09:36.617
to prove it.

09:36.659 --> 09:38.619
All right, Private Jetson.

09:38.661 --> 09:41.581
Get back in line!

09:42.874 --> 09:44.625
YOUNG MAN (muffled):

09:42.874 --> 09:44.625
I'm garbage.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.503
I belong

09:44.667 --> 09:46.503
in a garbage can.

09:46.545 --> 09:47.462
I am garbage.

09:47.504 --> 09:50.673
I belong in a garbage can.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.008
I am garbage.

09:52.050 --> 09:53.593
I belong in a

09:52.050 --> 09:53.593
garbage can. I am...

09:55.595 --> 09:57.847
Does he have to wear

09:55.595 --> 09:57.847
that thing?

09:57.889 --> 09:59.640
Hey, it was either

09:57.889 --> 09:59.640
house arrest or jail.

09:59.682 --> 10:02.018
I think we made

09:59.682 --> 10:02.018
the right choice.

10:02.060 --> 10:03.228
All right,

10:03.270 --> 10:04.229
your anklet sends a signal

10:04.271 --> 10:05.522
to the tamperproof base station.

10:05.564 --> 10:06.647
Your court order says

10:06.689 --> 10:08.567
you have to stay

10:06.689 --> 10:08.567
within a 50-foot radius.

10:08.608 --> 10:09.943
Can I shower with this?

10:09.984 --> 10:12.279
Oh, now you're

10:09.984 --> 10:12.279
snapping at me?

10:12.320 --> 10:14.906
Okay, you just lost

10:12.320 --> 10:14.906
ten feet.

10:14.948 --> 10:15.907
What are you doing?

10:15.949 --> 10:17.658
Let me tell you

10:15.949 --> 10:17.658
how this works.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.453
You may have a court order,

10:19.494 --> 10:21.288
but the truth is

10:19.494 --> 10:21.288
I can set this

10:21.329 --> 10:24.707
to whatever I want:

10:21.329 --> 10:24.707
200 miles or four inches.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.919
Oh, look.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.919
You're vacationing in Vegas.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.838
Whoops. You can't get

10:27.961 --> 10:30.838
out of your own bathroom.

10:30.880 --> 10:32.757
Lois, I've been in

10:30.880 --> 10:32.757
the public defender's office

10:32.799 --> 10:34.509
for ten years,

10:32.799 --> 10:34.509
and I can tell you

10:34.551 --> 10:36.677
that arraignment

10:34.551 --> 10:36.677
was  not  a disaster.

10:36.719 --> 10:40.265
I bet we can get 'em down

10:36.719 --> 10:40.265
to conspiracy to commit fraud.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.683
That's what

10:40.307 --> 10:42.683
he's already charged with!

10:42.725 --> 10:44.185
Oh.

10:45.019 --> 10:46.687
Do you have a pen?

10:46.729 --> 10:48.523
Look, I know how

10:46.729 --> 10:48.523
overworked you are,

10:48.565 --> 10:51.318
but from now on, you

10:48.565 --> 10:51.318
have only one case:

10:51.359 --> 10:52.860
an innocent man

10:51.359 --> 10:52.860
with five children

10:52.902 --> 10:54.695
and a wife whose lives

10:52.902 --> 10:54.695
are teetering

10:54.737 --> 10:55.738
on the brink of oblivion.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.532
Please don't let

10:55.780 --> 10:57.532
that happen.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.326
You have to

10:57.574 --> 10:59.326
save my family.

10:59.367 --> 11:01.536
You are the only

10:59.367 --> 11:01.536
person who can help us.

11:01.578 --> 11:04.164
Lois, I swear to you,

11:01.578 --> 11:04.164
I will work night and day

11:04.205 --> 11:05.999
to get your husband

11:04.205 --> 11:05.999
out of this.

11:06.040 --> 11:08.751
My screenplay can wait

11:06.040 --> 11:08.751
a few months.

11:10.545 --> 11:11.712
I'm sorry, Hal.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.423
I have to go to work,

11:11.754 --> 11:13.423
but don't worry.

11:13.465 --> 11:15.425
We will get through this.

11:16.468 --> 11:18.178
I love you.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.932
Oh, I have

11:20.013 --> 11:22.932
the most amazing wife.

11:22.974 --> 11:24.767
Now you're going to throw that

11:22.974 --> 11:24.767
in my face?

11:24.809 --> 11:26.685
That cost you five feet.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.649
All right, troop,

11:28.771 --> 11:30.649
you're next.

11:30.689 --> 11:32.691
Get in the chair.

11:33.776 --> 11:36.737
Okay, I was thinking

11:33.776 --> 11:36.737
something like this.

11:36.779 --> 11:37.738
Look at this lifeguard.

11:37.780 --> 11:39.616
Is there a straight-guy version

11:37.780 --> 11:39.616
of that,

11:39.658 --> 11:41.493
'cause that'd be perfect for me.

11:46.498 --> 11:50.418
Okay, if you stop here, I think

11:46.498 --> 11:50.418
I can still make it work.

11:58.968 --> 12:03.014
It'll look longer

11:58.968 --> 12:03.014
when it's combed out, right?

12:04.182 --> 12:05.183
There's no way

12:05.225 --> 12:06.560
I would have picked the laundry

12:06.601 --> 12:07.852
if I knew that this stuff

12:06.601 --> 12:07.852
was in it.

12:07.894 --> 12:09.770
You're afraid of your

12:07.894 --> 12:09.770
mother's underwear?

12:09.812 --> 12:11.814
What's the big deal about

12:09.812 --> 12:11.814
your mother's underwear?

12:11.856 --> 12:13.441
Stop saying

12:11.856 --> 12:13.441
"mother's underwear."

12:13.483 --> 12:15.776
I don't know how much longer

12:13.483 --> 12:15.776
Mom can handle all this--

12:15.818 --> 12:16.777
the double shifts, the bills,

12:16.819 --> 12:17.778
the meetings

12:17.820 --> 12:19.614
with the police and the lawyers.

12:19.656 --> 12:20.781
Don't forget

12:19.656 --> 12:20.781
the missing son.

12:20.823 --> 12:22.492
I'm going to find him!

12:23.117 --> 12:24.994
Well, if anyone cares,

12:25.036 --> 12:26.663
my flight number is five...

12:26.705 --> 12:28.289
Oh, hey, Mom.

12:28.331 --> 12:29.790
Just give us a second,

12:28.331 --> 12:29.790
and we'll clear

12:29.832 --> 12:30.917
all this stuff

12:29.832 --> 12:30.917
off the bed for you.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.005
What time

12:34.837 --> 12:36.005
does she want

12:36.047 --> 12:37.215
the alarm set?

12:37.257 --> 12:39.175
MALCOLM:

12:37.257 --> 12:39.175
5:30.

12:39.217 --> 12:40.843
We're also supposed

12:39.217 --> 12:40.843
to brush our teeth.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.846
Good morning, maggots!

12:43.888 --> 12:46.974
Now, I want you to understand

12:43.888 --> 12:46.974
why I call you maggots.

12:47.016 --> 12:49.603
The maggot is the slimy,

12:47.016 --> 12:49.603
quivering larval form

12:49.644 --> 12:53.398
of the common housefly, and we

12:49.644 --> 12:53.398
all know what maggots eat.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.025
And I will be the guy

12:53.440 --> 12:56.025
providing...

12:58.945 --> 13:00.821
Good God.

13:00.863 --> 13:02.990
I bet there's a great story

13:00.863 --> 13:02.990
for this, isn't there, son?

13:03.032 --> 13:04.409
Hang on.

13:04.451 --> 13:06.369
Of course.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.664
Okay.

13:09.706 --> 13:10.915
Would you like to tell me

13:10.957 --> 13:12.833
what happened to your gear,

13:10.957 --> 13:12.833
Private?

13:12.875 --> 13:13.834
Oh, I traded it.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.462
I got this and five cartridges.

13:15.503 --> 13:18.005
So, you just blithely

13:15.503 --> 13:18.005
gave away

13:18.047 --> 13:20.883
your government-issued rucksack

13:18.047 --> 13:20.883
and poncho?

13:20.925 --> 13:23.010
Well, the pack, I figure,

13:20.925 --> 13:23.010
I can eventually get

13:23.052 --> 13:24.554
off a dead guy,

13:23.052 --> 13:24.554
and the poncho?

13:24.596 --> 13:27.307
Come on. Does it look

13:24.596 --> 13:27.307
like rain to you?

13:28.516 --> 13:30.851
♪ My drill sergeant

13:28.516 --> 13:30.851

13:30.893 --> 13:32.895

(grunts)

14:05.928 --> 14:07.722
Oh, my God! Jamie!

14:07.764 --> 14:08.847
Jamie.

14:07.764 --> 14:08.847
(beeping)

14:10.183 --> 14:11.892
Jamie, honey,

14:11.934 --> 14:12.977
c-come to Daddy.

14:13.019 --> 14:14.479
Come to Daddy, Jamie.

14:14.521 --> 14:16.022
Come on. Jamie!

14:22.111 --> 14:23.530
Look inside the basket.

14:23.571 --> 14:24.739
Look, Jamie, it's

14:23.571 --> 14:24.739
your favorite.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.578
Jamie, don't go in there.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.578
That's dangerous!

14:30.620 --> 14:32.913
No, no, no, no.

14:32.955 --> 14:33.914
You stay away from there.

14:33.956 --> 14:36.459
Don't you touch that.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.420
(babbling)

14:37.377 --> 14:39.420
Attaboy.

14:39.462 --> 14:40.921
Attaboy, Jamie!

14:40.963 --> 14:43.299
There.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.299
(phone rings)

14:43.341 --> 14:44.759
Hello.

14:44.801 --> 14:45.926
MAN:

14:44.801 --> 14:45.926
Hello, Hal.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.928
I have some information

14:45.968 --> 14:47.928
that can help you.

14:47.970 --> 14:49.930
What? Who is this?

14:49.972 --> 14:52.183
I'm not going to tell you,

14:49.972 --> 14:52.183
but I know you're innocent,

14:52.225 --> 14:53.184
and I can prove it.

14:53.226 --> 14:54.435
We need to meet

14:54.477 --> 14:56.521
face to face,

14:54.477 --> 14:56.521
somewhere where there's a crowd.

14:56.563 --> 14:57.605
But I can't...

14:57.647 --> 14:58.732
Look, if you want to stay

14:58.773 --> 14:59.940
out of jail, you'll do it.

14:59.982 --> 15:00.983
Why can't you come here?

15:01.025 --> 15:02.443
Your place is being watched.

15:02.485 --> 15:03.944
Your phone's probably

15:02.485 --> 15:03.944
bugged, too.

15:03.986 --> 15:04.945
Meet me Thursday

15:04.987 --> 15:06.865
at noon at the place

15:04.987 --> 15:06.865
where you go

15:06.906 --> 15:08.575
when you say you're getting

15:06.906 --> 15:08.575
more toner.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.243
The Donut Shack?

15:10.284 --> 15:12.203
All right, plan "B."

15:12.245 --> 15:13.788
Meet me at the place

15:12.245 --> 15:13.788
where you go

15:13.830 --> 15:15.749
when you say you've got

15:13.830 --> 15:15.749
a dentist appointment.

15:15.790 --> 15:17.625
Don't say where it is.

15:17.667 --> 15:18.585
Got it.

15:18.626 --> 15:20.420
Hey, I know who this is.

15:20.461 --> 15:22.046
You're...

15:20.461 --> 15:22.046
(phone clicks)

15:22.088 --> 15:24.549
My drill sergeant's breath

15:22.088 --> 15:24.549
is not my concern!

15:24.591 --> 15:26.967
My drill sergeant's

15:24.591 --> 15:26.967
breath is not my concern!

15:27.009 --> 15:29.387
My drill sergeant's breath

15:27.009 --> 15:29.387
is not my concern!

15:29.429 --> 15:31.681
So, I put the base station

15:29.429 --> 15:31.681
in there

15:31.723 --> 15:33.015
with a portable power supply.

15:33.057 --> 15:36.227
I modulated a standard cell

15:33.057 --> 15:36.227
phone to mimic the analog modem.

15:36.269 --> 15:38.646
Just make sure you stay

15:36.269 --> 15:38.646
within 30 feet of this backpack.

15:38.688 --> 15:42.066
Don't worry. I've got the ankle

15:38.688 --> 15:42.066
bracelet completely camouflaged.

15:46.696 --> 15:48.782
Can you believe your mom wanted

15:46.696 --> 15:48.782
to give these to the blind?

15:48.823 --> 15:50.825
Remember, you have

15:48.823 --> 15:50.825
to be back by 4:00.

15:50.867 --> 15:51.992
That's when Mom gets home.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.202
And you understand

15:52.034 --> 15:53.202
how important it is

15:53.244 --> 15:54.662
to keep this from her,

15:53.244 --> 15:54.662
don't you?

15:54.704 --> 15:56.247
Francis, you're in charge

15:54.704 --> 15:56.247
of making sure

15:56.289 --> 15:58.875
Malcolm doesn't betray me,

15:56.289 --> 15:58.875
like he's prone to do.

15:58.917 --> 16:00.835
Absolutely.

16:06.507 --> 16:10.010
Well, troop, you've

16:06.507 --> 16:10.010
polished your boots

16:06.507 --> 16:10.010
before everyone else.

16:10.052 --> 16:14.474
How on God's good earth

16:10.052 --> 16:14.474
did you accomplish

16:10.052 --> 16:14.474
that miracle?

16:14.515 --> 16:16.684
I just did it exactly the way

16:14.515 --> 16:16.684
you told me to.

16:16.726 --> 16:18.645
Remove laces,

16:16.726 --> 16:18.645
pull tongue forward,

16:18.686 --> 16:20.229
apply polish,

16:18.686 --> 16:20.229
pull tongue backward,

16:20.271 --> 16:22.523
buff, replace laces, repeat.

16:22.565 --> 16:24.776
I did the same thing to make my

16:22.565 --> 16:24.776
bed and secure my foot locker.

16:28.070 --> 16:31.950
Well, that's the most

16:28.070 --> 16:31.950
miraculous turnaround

16:28.070 --> 16:31.950
that I've ever seen.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.034
I want you to explain

16:31.991 --> 16:34.034
to these recruits

16:34.076 --> 16:35.829
how the worst

16:34.076 --> 16:35.829
soldier in the unit

16:35.870 --> 16:37.747
has managed to put them all

16:35.870 --> 16:37.747
to shame!

16:37.789 --> 16:40.040
I just stopped thinking.

16:40.082 --> 16:43.085
I figured out that using my

16:40.082 --> 16:43.085
brain was the whole problem...

16:43.127 --> 16:45.755
not just here,

16:43.127 --> 16:45.755
but my entire life.

16:45.797 --> 16:48.132
If I just do exactly

16:45.797 --> 16:48.132
what I'm told and nothing else,

16:48.174 --> 16:50.635
then everything gets easy.

16:50.677 --> 16:53.053
It's not even a question

16:50.677 --> 16:53.053
of smart or dumb.

16:53.095 --> 16:56.349
You just turn yourself

16:53.095 --> 16:56.349
into a tool.

16:56.390 --> 16:58.559
I'm much happier that way.

16:58.601 --> 17:00.895
I'm the world's happiest tool.

17:00.937 --> 17:03.147
You must be proud

17:00.937 --> 17:03.147
of yourself, son.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.649
I don't know if I am or not.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.734
I'm waiting for you

17:04.691 --> 17:06.734
to tell me.

17:07.777 --> 17:09.863
My God.

17:09.904 --> 17:14.575
A soldier like you

17:09.904 --> 17:14.575
comes along once in

17:09.904 --> 17:14.575
a thousand years.

17:17.745 --> 17:19.706
Mom! You're home early.

17:19.747 --> 17:22.082
Yup. Got fired.

17:19.747 --> 17:22.082
What?!

17:22.124 --> 17:23.250
I gave someone $2,000

17:23.292 --> 17:25.920
in change instead of $20.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.005
But you know what?

17:27.046 --> 17:29.089
We just adapt. We move forward.

17:29.131 --> 17:30.090
I'll get another job,

17:30.132 --> 17:32.092
and in the meantime,

17:30.132 --> 17:32.092
I can get started on dinner.

17:32.134 --> 17:34.804
Actually, they repossessed

17:32.134 --> 17:34.804
the fridge this morning.

17:37.139 --> 17:40.100
Fine. We will get through this.

17:40.142 --> 17:41.519
(electrical sizzling)

17:41.561 --> 17:43.103
It's okay.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.188
He's all right.

17:44.230 --> 17:47.525
Just got away from

17:44.230 --> 17:47.525
me for a second.

17:50.152 --> 17:54.323
And we will get through this...

17:50.152 --> 17:54.323
as long as we're together,

17:54.365 --> 17:56.116
as long as we have each other.

17:56.158 --> 17:59.370
We are a family. Where's Dad?

18:01.581 --> 18:03.165
He's gone.

18:05.626 --> 18:08.212
I think I'll take a shower.

18:15.970 --> 18:18.138
Left, right, left, right!

18:18.180 --> 18:21.559
Fork up! In! Chew, chew!

18:21.601 --> 18:23.143
Left to right!

18:23.185 --> 18:25.145
Front to back!

18:25.187 --> 18:26.773
Bear down!

18:26.814 --> 18:29.817
Pinch!

18:41.203 --> 18:45.541
One, two, three, four...

18:45.583 --> 18:48.210
29, 30.

19:02.224 --> 19:04.018
Listen, I don't

19:02.224 --> 19:04.018
have much time.

19:04.060 --> 19:05.603
I know everybody

19:04.060 --> 19:05.603
who's in on this,

19:05.645 --> 19:07.105
and I know exactly

19:05.645 --> 19:07.105
what they did

19:07.146 --> 19:08.064
because I helped 'em.

19:08.106 --> 19:09.189
What?

19:08.106 --> 19:09.189
They paid

19:08.106 --> 19:09.189
me millions.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.776
I was happy

19:09.231 --> 19:11.776
just to sit back

19:11.818 --> 19:13.069
and watch you

19:11.818 --> 19:13.069
take a fall.

19:14.445 --> 19:16.697
But then I found

19:14.445 --> 19:16.697
out I'm dying.

19:17.490 --> 19:19.033
I got six months

19:17.490 --> 19:19.033
at the most.

19:19.075 --> 19:21.201
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

19:21.243 --> 19:23.496
Listen, I can't go to my grave

19:21.243 --> 19:23.496
with this on my conscience,

19:23.537 --> 19:26.165
so I'm flipping on all of them--

19:23.537 --> 19:26.165
I'm going to tell the truth...

19:27.249 --> 19:28.835
...but we can't

19:27.249 --> 19:28.835
tip our hand.

19:28.876 --> 19:30.128
They're too powerful.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.712
If they even get

19:30.169 --> 19:31.712
a whiff of this,

19:31.754 --> 19:33.422
they'll just fabricate

19:31.754 --> 19:33.422
new documents,

19:33.464 --> 19:34.381
and we'll both go down.

19:34.423 --> 19:35.800
You won't hear from me

19:35.842 --> 19:37.969
until I show up

19:35.842 --> 19:37.969
at the courthouse.

19:38.761 --> 19:40.220
Don't follow me.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.222
I've also got some

19:40.262 --> 19:42.222
overdue book fines

19:42.264 --> 19:44.934
I want to get

19:42.264 --> 19:44.934
off my conscience.

19:46.894 --> 19:48.896
Mom, will you at least

19:48.938 --> 19:50.023
talk to us?

19:50.064 --> 19:52.066
LOIS:

19:50.064 --> 19:52.066
I'm in the shower, honey.

19:52.108 --> 19:53.818
Yes, we know

19:52.108 --> 19:53.818
you're in the shower.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.402
It's been three hours now.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.071
The water must be freezing.

19:57.113 --> 20:00.158
LOIS:

19:57.113 --> 20:00.158
Do I bother you

19:57.113 --> 20:00.158
when you're in the shower?

20:06.873 --> 20:11.251
Mom, listen, I know how

20:06.873 --> 20:11.251
hard this is for you.

20:11.293 --> 20:13.129
I know how scared

20:11.293 --> 20:13.129
you are,

20:13.171 --> 20:14.254
but you know what?

20:14.296 --> 20:16.256
You've got a family

20:14.296 --> 20:16.256
that depends on you,

20:16.298 --> 20:17.299
and as impossible

20:17.341 --> 20:18.425
as it seems, you just got

20:18.467 --> 20:20.260
to suck it up one more time.

20:20.302 --> 20:23.263
Just one more time, Mom;

20:20.302 --> 20:23.263
that's all we need.

20:23.305 --> 20:25.432
You know you can do this.

20:25.474 --> 20:28.561
LOIS:

20:25.474 --> 20:28.561
In a minute.

20:25.474 --> 20:28.561
I'm in the shower.

20:29.937 --> 20:31.564
Ooh!

20:31.605 --> 20:33.649
Sorry, Officer. Excuse me.

20:33.691 --> 20:35.526
You in a hurry?

20:33.691 --> 20:35.526
You know, busy day.

20:35.568 --> 20:36.944
You understand.

20:35.568 --> 20:36.944
Is that your backpack?

20:36.986 --> 20:39.697
Oh, uh, no, no.

20:36.986 --> 20:39.697
Absolutely not.

20:39.739 --> 20:40.823
Better check it out.

20:45.327 --> 20:47.329
Whoa! I think we

20:45.327 --> 20:47.329
got a bomb here.

20:47.371 --> 20:48.455
You got to get out of here.

20:48.497 --> 20:49.582
No, I-I can't.

20:49.623 --> 20:50.958
Sir, I need you to step away

20:51.000 --> 20:52.919
to a distance

20:51.000 --> 20:52.919
of at least 150 feet.

20:52.960 --> 20:56.296
I can't do that. I'm... I'm...

20:56.338 --> 20:58.716
I'm in the bomb squad.

20:58.758 --> 20:59.717
What?

20:58.758 --> 20:59.717
That's right.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.552
You better let a professional

20:59.759 --> 21:01.552
handle this.

21:01.594 --> 21:04.304
Damn. I was a week

21:01.594 --> 21:04.304
from retirement.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.306
You get to safety.

21:04.346 --> 21:06.306
I'll take it from here.

21:06.348 --> 21:07.307
Yes, sir.
