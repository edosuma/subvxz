WEBVTT

00:05.731 --> 00:07.748
Innkeeper! Another round!

00:08.250 --> 00:10.926
(to Chia Pet tune):
Ch-Ch-Ch-Chee-eers!

00:11.828 --> 00:13.178
-Thank you, Carter.
-Yeah.

00:13.330 --> 00:16.573
And, uh, here you go, Carter.

00:16.592 --> 00:17.850
(laughs)

00:18.093 --> 00:20.853
What I want to know is, does
the carpet match the bushes?

00:21.080 --> 00:23.338
Don't be a ho-ho-ho
in front of Santa.

00:23.432 --> 00:24.356
I'm not Santa.

00:24.508 --> 00:26.583
I'm Euclid,
the father of geometry.

00:26.602 --> 00:30.678
Not Euclid of Alexandria,
Euclid of Megara. Duh.

00:30.698 --> 00:33.590
Well, I don't know
about Eu-clid, but Eu-dumb.

00:33.683 --> 00:34.775
(imitates Carter's laugh)

00:34.927 --> 00:37.661
That is what I would say.
(laughs)

00:40.190 --> 00:43.450
I was having trouble finding
this place with a helmet on,

00:43.602 --> 00:47.437
but then I realized...
this is the way.

00:47.531 --> 00:49.381
(laughter)

00:50.109 --> 00:52.551
(groans, pants)

00:54.221 --> 00:57.431
Nanu-nanu, everyone. (laughs)

00:59.560 --> 01:00.967
Hey, Santa.

01:01.062 --> 01:05.046
When parallel lines extend
infinitely and never intersect,

01:05.066 --> 01:06.899
is that called Santa's law?!

01:07.050 --> 01:10.069
I don't know, but if there was
a cop show called<i> Santa's Law,</i>

01:10.220 --> 01:11.403
I'm watching it. (laughs)

01:11.555 --> 01:14.073
Okay, you got
to get up out of my head.

01:15.317 --> 01:17.968
Seems kind of dead
for Hallo-Octoweenerfest.

01:18.061 --> 01:19.486
The concept couldn't be
more clear.

01:19.638 --> 01:22.081
It combines the best
of Halloween and Oktoberfest

01:22.308 --> 01:23.582
with 200 pounds of sausage
I bought

01:23.733 --> 01:25.084
from a guy at the airport.

01:25.235 --> 01:26.401
(with German accent):
Guten Tag.

01:26.495 --> 01:29.463
Free wieners,<i> fahrvergnügen?</i>

01:30.907 --> 01:34.284
Okay, baby, I love you,
but this Hallo-Octoweenerfest

01:34.286 --> 01:36.578
is the stupidest idea
you've ever had.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.079
Oh, I'm being Randi now.

01:38.099 --> 01:40.173
Uh, if you want more people,

01:40.250 --> 01:41.658
why not just have
a Ladies' Night?

01:41.677 --> 01:43.268
Carter's right, Carter.

01:43.420 --> 01:44.603
Then the number of men
in the bar

01:44.754 --> 01:46.421
will be equal to the number
of women in the bar

01:46.590 --> 01:49.850
multiplied by the number of
drinks at half price. (laughs)

01:50.794 --> 01:53.654
Okay, I'm Santa,
and you're all getting coal.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.115
Ah. Hello, all.

01:56.283 --> 02:00.101
Happy...
whatever this fiasco is.

02:01.196 --> 02:05.198
Sheila, we told you
we were all gonna dress up.

02:05.292 --> 02:08.201
I know.
I'm going as Drunk Sheila.

02:08.295 --> 02:10.629
Let me get into costume.

02:11.690 --> 02:14.358
Oh. Got rejected again.

02:14.451 --> 02:17.285
Like, you stalk one sperm donor,
and all of a sudden,

02:17.379 --> 02:20.197
you're banned from every
spank bank in Kentucky.

02:20.199 --> 02:21.473
Oh, I'm sorry.

02:21.700 --> 02:24.143
Maybe it's a sign I'm just
never gonna be a mother.

02:24.294 --> 02:27.396
Your hideous Santa outfit
was a bigger sign.

02:31.301 --> 02:34.378
(rock music plays quietly)

02:34.396 --> 02:36.471
Kat?

02:36.490 --> 02:37.714
Over here!

02:37.825 --> 02:40.993
Why are you wearing that helmet
if you can't see?

02:44.498 --> 02:46.165
Because I look cool.

02:46.392 --> 02:47.332
Do you?

02:47.484 --> 02:51.378
(groans)
Big talk coming from Math Santa.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.822
Can I ask you a question?

02:54.917 --> 02:56.175
If you want
to be Carter next year, no,

02:56.326 --> 02:57.659
-I already called it.
-(laughs)

02:57.753 --> 03:01.180
I was thinking about...

03:01.407 --> 03:03.182
(sighs)

03:03.333 --> 03:05.091
Well...

03:05.244 --> 03:08.103
what if I fathered your child?

03:08.931 --> 03:10.689
Are you serious?

03:11.583 --> 03:12.733
Yeah.

03:14.695 --> 03:15.736
Wow.

03:17.105 --> 03:18.363
You don't think it'd be weird?

03:18.515 --> 03:21.441
It's only weird
if you make it weird.

03:21.535 --> 03:22.850
I'm currently wearing a beard

03:22.870 --> 03:24.428
and historically accurate
underwear.

03:24.446 --> 03:27.706
-I make everything weird.

03:37.109 --> 03:38.775
Why not?

03:38.868 --> 03:43.055
I'd be helping someone I love

03:43.966 --> 03:45.949
Would you want to be involved

03:45.968 --> 03:50.211

04:10.584 --> 04:12.476
We won,
but the part I liked best

04:12.494 --> 04:14.661
was working together
as a team.

04:14.813 --> 04:18.164
You should've seen him.
He scored all the team's points

04:18.241 --> 04:20.500

Oh, Max Jr., you must be

I mean, make a baby. 'Cause,
like, we wouldn't be doing it.

04:51.792 --> 04:53.199
You know, you'd be
masturbating. Like...

04:53.294 --> 04:54.534
-Right.

Hopefully, Max's genes
will offset all of... this.

05:13.129 --> 05:17.040
Hopefully, my mothering skills
will offset all of this.

05:17.133 --> 05:21.061
So you and Max are finally
gonna mash potatoes?

05:21.213 --> 05:22.879
Nobody's mashing potatoes.

05:22.898 --> 05:24.881
He's just...
giving her his gravy.

05:24.900 --> 05:26.049
Oh!

05:26.218 --> 05:27.642
Yeah, we're gonna use the eggs
that I froze.

05:27.736 --> 05:29.328
It's all gonna be done in a lab.

05:29.404 --> 05:31.905
But I did request that they play
"Let's Get It On."

05:32.074 --> 05:35.241
-(drill whirring)
-Oh, damn. My boyfriend's

05:35.318 --> 05:36.726
on a ladder with a power tool.

05:36.895 --> 05:39.421
Somebody dial
the first two numbers of 911.

05:40.323 --> 05:41.898
Carter, what are you doing?

05:41.917 --> 05:44.568
Your idea.
We're having a Ladies' Night.

05:44.586 --> 05:46.086
Check it out.

05:46.162 --> 05:49.664
"Ladies drink for half price,
free sausage tonight only."

05:49.683 --> 05:51.499
Yeah, but it looks like,

05:51.593 --> 05:55.520
"Ladies for free tonight,
drink half-price sausage only."

05:55.672 --> 05:58.565
Hmm. I'd go to that bar.

06:00.194 --> 06:01.526
Oh, excuse me, ladies.

06:01.678 --> 06:02.861
We haven't been this busy

06:03.088 --> 06:04.588
since they used this place
as a storm shelter.

06:04.681 --> 06:07.699
I mean, Hurricane Chelsea
was Hurricane Cha-Ching.

06:07.851 --> 06:10.184
(laughs) Well, I don't like
to say I told you so,

06:10.278 --> 06:13.780
but I'm beautiful, smart, and
not humble, so I told you so.

06:13.932 --> 06:16.524
-(laughs)
-Yeah, Middle C is poppin'.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.877
It's getting Orville Redenbacher
up in here.

06:19.104 --> 06:21.046
Come on, Kat.
You can do "butter" than that.

06:21.197 --> 06:23.048
(Kat cackles)

06:23.199 --> 06:26.367
-I hope our baby's
not too funny.
-Right?

06:26.387 --> 06:27.961
Right? (laughs)

06:28.113 --> 06:31.038
This is why we need
more Black friends.

06:31.133 --> 06:33.558
(laughing)

06:34.953 --> 06:39.623
Oh, my goodness,
it's Queen Dicktoria!

06:39.641 --> 06:41.549
-Oh.
-She's my absolute

06:41.643 --> 06:42.809
favorite drag queen.

06:42.961 --> 06:44.736
Oh. Stunning!

06:44.963 --> 06:47.130
She puts all the women here
to shame.

06:47.223 --> 06:51.201
-This is where you say,
"Not you, Sheila."
-Oh.

06:52.562 --> 06:55.972
Martini, mojito
and a double tequila shot.

06:56.065 --> 06:59.901
-Girl, what did he do?
-(laughter)

06:59.995 --> 07:01.478
We all love your hair.

07:01.496 --> 07:03.404
Well, let me let you in
on a little secret.

07:03.573 --> 07:05.331
I'm thinking
about growing it out.

07:05.426 --> 07:07.259
(laughter)

07:07.486 --> 07:09.261
Carter's got some fans tonight.

07:09.430 --> 07:11.004
Yeah,
I've surrounded my boyfriend

07:11.098 --> 07:12.989
with young, hot, drunk women.

07:12.991 --> 07:15.842
Should've just let him die
on that ladder.

07:15.936 --> 07:19.104
Queen Dicktoria,
this is my friend Phil.

07:19.214 --> 07:23.349
-Hello.
<i> -Enchanté,</i> Your Vag-esty.

07:23.502 --> 07:26.111
-(laughs)
-Phil's a performer, too.

07:26.338 --> 07:27.946
-Oh.
-He once clogged

07:28.173 --> 07:30.340
in the country dancers show
at Dollywood.

07:30.358 --> 07:32.951
Could I see some
of that clogging?

07:33.102 --> 07:36.346
Oh, you don't want
to see an old man like me dance.

07:36.348 --> 07:40.459
I'm sorry. Are you refusing
a royal request?

07:45.207 --> 07:46.465
So, are you nervous

07:46.616 --> 07:49.209
about whisking up
the old baby batter tomorrow?

07:49.361 --> 07:50.710
Don't worry. I got this.

07:50.862 --> 07:52.712
I spent six months sleeping
in a trailer with two clowns

07:52.789 --> 07:56.049
and a trapeze artist,
and I still got my reps in.

07:56.201 --> 07:57.642
Two clowns and a trapeze artist?

07:57.869 --> 08:00.628
Is that what you call
your junk in front of the trunk?

08:00.647 --> 08:03.556
No, it's when I was with
the traveling circus in England.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.742
You were in the circus?

08:05.744 --> 08:08.394
Yeah, I was doing my field work
and finishing my degree.

08:08.471 --> 08:09.729
And one night,
I got really drunk,

08:09.823 --> 08:13.641
and well, when I woke up,
I worked for the circus.

08:13.735 --> 08:15.309
You know how it goes.

08:15.329 --> 08:18.388
I-I do not know how that goes.

08:18.406 --> 08:20.332
Although this one time,
I got pretty drunk,

08:20.483 --> 08:21.983
and I ate a third
of a box of Total.

08:22.002 --> 08:24.077
That is a young woman's game.

08:24.229 --> 08:25.745
-(chuckles)
-Mm.

08:25.897 --> 08:27.397
What did you do in the circus?

08:27.415 --> 08:29.733
Oh, a bunch of stuff.
Uh, played in the band,

08:29.751 --> 08:30.825
set up the tents,

08:30.919 --> 08:33.920
helped the cute contortionist
limber up.

08:34.072 --> 08:35.347
When did you finish your degree?

08:35.498 --> 08:37.999
So that's kind of
my dirty little secret.

08:38.018 --> 08:39.759
I never graduated.

08:39.836 --> 08:41.520
(laughs)

08:41.747 --> 08:44.856
I can't believe you never
told me this. You're...

08:45.083 --> 08:47.100
(whispering):
You're a drop-out?

08:47.252 --> 08:48.752
What's the big deal?

08:48.845 --> 08:50.270
I mean, I'm a musician.

08:50.422 --> 08:52.422
For me,
a degree was kind of pointless.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.866
You know, like... like flossing.

08:55.093 --> 08:57.443
Oh, so... so now you're against
higher education

08:57.538 --> 08:58.428
and oral hygiene?

08:58.446 --> 09:00.187
Max, do you like nothing fun?

09:00.265 --> 09:04.358
I'm just saying, you have a
degree, and you own a cat café.

09:04.378 --> 09:06.211
Yeah, and getting that degree
taught me

09:06.362 --> 09:08.454
about hard work
and perseverance.

09:08.549 --> 09:11.383
You want to talk about
hard work and perseverance?

09:11.610 --> 09:14.127
Spend six years putting up
a circus tent in a wind storm

09:14.221 --> 09:16.596
while a mime goes...

09:19.042 --> 09:20.300
Six years?

09:20.394 --> 09:22.135
Well, it wasn't
six years nonstop.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.954
I'd work a few months,
drift around,

09:25.048 --> 09:26.380
sleeping where I could.

09:26.474 --> 09:27.624
There's a lot
of abandoned castles in Europe.

09:27.642 --> 09:28.958
It was awesome.

09:29.127 --> 09:31.961
Yeah, that-that doesn't sound
awesome.

09:32.130 --> 09:33.463
Trust me,
if you're in the Greek isles,

09:33.598 --> 09:37.033
and you look like me,
it's awesome.

09:38.486 --> 09:40.036
(laughs nervously)

09:44.233 --> 09:46.067
-All right now.
-(bell clangs)

09:46.128 --> 09:47.143
Closing time!

09:47.162 --> 09:48.478
Lights coming up.

09:48.496 --> 09:50.997
A lot of you eights about
to turn into fours.

09:51.149 --> 09:52.924
Babe, what are you doing?

09:53.076 --> 09:54.759
Nobody rings that bell but me.

09:55.596 --> 09:56.820
And you.

09:56.913 --> 09:59.431
It's 2:00 a.m.
You usually close at midnight.

09:59.582 --> 10:02.300
Yeah, but my friends are still
drinking, and we're having fun.

10:02.527 --> 10:05.328
Oh. Did you know that you can
make your porn name

10:05.347 --> 10:07.497
by combining
the name of your first pet

10:07.515 --> 10:09.165
and the street
that you grew up on?

10:09.184 --> 10:10.758
I'm Corky 95th.

10:10.852 --> 10:14.838
Oh, so is that what you and
your friends talk about? Porn?

10:15.006 --> 10:16.522
Oh. Well, we talk
about a lot of stuff.

10:16.675 --> 10:19.117
Like, Monica's going through
a divorce, Tina's a single mom,

10:19.268 --> 10:22.603
and Lauren... Well, Lauren does
talk about porn a lot.

10:22.623 --> 10:25.272
She's got daddy issues.

10:25.292 --> 10:27.533
I cannot believe how late it is.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.702
Oh, I know. When I get home,
I'm gonna tuck myself in.

10:29.855 --> 10:32.797
Which is not the first time
I've done that tonight.

10:32.949 --> 10:35.208
(both laugh)

10:36.361 --> 10:39.804
Well, I... I'm so glad
I got to meet you.

10:39.956 --> 10:44.142
Me, too. Maybe we'll run
into each other again sometime?

10:44.311 --> 10:47.036
Well, I'm the baker at
the coffee shop across the way.

10:47.130 --> 10:48.462
I'd brag about my sticky buns,

10:48.556 --> 10:50.464
but that's no way
to talk to a lady.

10:50.558 --> 10:55.211
Honey, I may be a queen,
but I'm no lady.

10:55.230 --> 10:56.804
-Oh! (laughs)
-(laughs)

10:56.898 --> 10:59.048
(Phil sighs)

10:59.067 --> 11:00.700
Good night, Phil.

11:01.569 --> 11:03.578
Night night.

11:05.407 --> 11:07.582
(door opens)

11:08.560 --> 11:09.817
(door closes)

11:09.911 --> 11:11.461
Oh.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.677
♪ ♪

11:22.498 --> 11:24.516
What's up?

11:24.743 --> 11:26.426
Hi, sweetie. How was school?

11:26.578 --> 11:28.261
Yeah, I didn't go.

11:28.413 --> 11:31.915
What?! You skipped school?

11:31.933 --> 11:33.358
Yeah.

11:33.435 --> 11:35.509
I'm gonna drop out, play music,

11:35.529 --> 11:38.512
and get with circus chicks
just like Uncle Dad.

11:38.532 --> 11:42.183
Yeah, buddy.
Quitters for life! (groans)

11:42.277 --> 11:43.927
But what about your future?

11:43.945 --> 11:47.872
Mom, it's okay.
I'm good-looking.

11:48.099 --> 11:49.749
That's my boy.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.503
I'm gonna go clear
my browser history.

11:58.777 --> 12:01.219
(gasps)
That settles it.

12:01.370 --> 12:04.431
No child of mine is gonna be
good-looking!

12:05.708 --> 12:07.374
(TV plays quietly)

12:07.427 --> 12:10.395
Hey, baby.
What you still doing up?

12:10.546 --> 12:11.879
Oh.

12:12.048 --> 12:15.308
You want a little bit
of Corky 95th?

12:15.460 --> 12:18.403
It's almost 4:00
in the morning.

12:18.554 --> 12:21.222
Sorry. I got stuck

12:21.241 --> 12:24.242
in a rainstorm! (laughs)

12:24.469 --> 12:26.745
Well, I'm glad
you had a good night.

12:26.896 --> 12:28.321
Now can you pick up
all this money

12:28.415 --> 12:30.306
that's covered
in hoochie cooties?

12:30.325 --> 12:33.142
Hold up. What's going on?

12:33.161 --> 12:35.069
Are you jealous?

12:35.163 --> 12:37.313
-(scoffs) No!
-Huh?

12:37.332 --> 12:39.573
I think you are.
That's the same face you made

12:39.593 --> 12:42.001
when I took the last Cheddar
Bay Biscuit at Red Lobster.

12:42.153 --> 12:44.929
Excuse you. I am a strong,
independent woman.

12:45.081 --> 12:47.581
I don't get jealous.
And that biscuit was mine.

12:47.601 --> 12:49.416
-You had two,
and I only had one!
-Mm.

12:49.511 --> 12:53.012
Which is why I'm gonna buy you
all the biscuits you want

12:53.164 --> 12:55.665
to go with that jelly!

12:55.683 --> 12:57.000
And-and... and just so you know,

12:57.093 --> 12:58.835
you looked really stupid
trying to be all flirty.

12:58.928 --> 13:00.928
Well, I was being charming.
That's just good business.

13:00.947 --> 13:02.447
And what do you know
about business?

13:02.674 --> 13:04.932
Well, I know enough to have
a lot more Ladies' Nights.

13:05.026 --> 13:06.692
Fine. That's okay.
I don't even give a damn.

13:06.845 --> 13:10.980
It's a bad move picking a fight
a week before Lobsterfest!

13:11.032 --> 13:13.625
(groans)

13:14.443 --> 13:15.794
Hi.

13:15.945 --> 13:17.629
You ready to go? I'm parked
in a red zone, and I really

13:17.856 --> 13:19.947
don't want to explain to a cop
that I'm about to go...

13:19.966 --> 13:21.782
(whistles,
imitates cartoon noises)

13:21.876 --> 13:23.251
...for a friend.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.878
Wow. That sounds stressful.

13:25.972 --> 13:27.563
Maybe we should postpone.

13:27.565 --> 13:30.366
I've heard that stressed-out
sperm can lead to redheads.

13:30.385 --> 13:31.476
I don't want to postpone.

13:31.627 --> 13:33.127
They made me abstain
for three days

13:33.146 --> 13:34.370
before this appointment.

13:34.463 --> 13:37.040
I had to shower
wearing oven mitts.

13:37.058 --> 13:38.316
Are we rushing into this?

13:38.467 --> 13:40.634
I mean,
yes, we're great friends,

13:40.728 --> 13:42.211
but would we be great parents?

13:42.230 --> 13:43.379
Like,
you're a little bit country,

13:43.398 --> 13:44.638
I'm a little bit rock and roll.

13:44.807 --> 13:46.566
You're Netflix, I'm more Hulu.

13:46.660 --> 13:48.067
Hello, Hulu viewers.

13:48.144 --> 13:50.978
I hope you're enjoying
Season Three, Episode Five.

13:50.997 --> 13:53.056
Are you getting cold feet?

13:53.074 --> 13:54.407
You're gonna be a great mom.

13:54.559 --> 13:56.835
You're patient,
you're nurturing.

13:57.062 --> 13:59.653
-Yeah, I'm not worried about me.
-Oh.

13:59.747 --> 14:01.655
Oh, so you're worried about me?

14:01.749 --> 14:03.490
I-I'm worried about my child.

14:03.585 --> 14:04.676
I-I want to make sure

14:04.827 --> 14:06.903
I give them every opportunity
to succeed.

14:06.996 --> 14:08.905
Oh, okay.

14:08.998 --> 14:10.331
I get it now.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.408
You don't think I'm good enough
to be the father?

14:12.427 --> 14:14.594
Max, you're-you're great.
It's just, like, um...

14:14.688 --> 14:17.522
I think higher education
is really important.

14:17.673 --> 14:20.024
You dropped out of school
to join the circus

14:20.251 --> 14:21.860
and make pervy pretzels
with the bendy girls.

14:22.011 --> 14:25.179
-And you're so perfect?
-Well, I-I... I didn't say that.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.272
Because there are things
about you

14:26.366 --> 14:27.940
that I wouldn't want
to see in my kid.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.258
Really? Like what?

14:29.277 --> 14:30.943
Clumsy, allergic to avocado,

14:31.096 --> 14:33.538
mean to only person
who wants to give her sperm.

14:33.689 --> 14:35.448
I'm not allergic to avocado.

14:35.542 --> 14:38.042
I use it as a test to make sure
the waiter's listening.

14:38.194 --> 14:40.545
-You know what?
Do whatever you want.
-Wait.

14:40.696 --> 14:42.939
You're just gonna leave
mid-argument? God, Max,

14:42.957 --> 14:44.698
it's like
you can't finish anything.

14:44.718 --> 14:46.609
Oh, I'm gonna finish something.

14:46.702 --> 14:50.096
And then I'm gonna take a nap,
and I'm gonna finish it again!

15:07.982 --> 15:10.466
Is this all
to impress Queen Dicktoria?

15:10.559 --> 15:12.744
Did she tell you
she was stopping by?

15:12.895 --> 15:14.837
No, but she knows I work here,

15:14.839 --> 15:15.972
and the last thing she said was

15:16.065 --> 15:18.141
maybe she'll run
into me sometime.

15:18.234 --> 15:20.734
Ooh. Sounds to me
like you got curved.

15:20.754 --> 15:22.253
Totes Magee.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.829
What's curved?

15:23.924 --> 15:26.149
What the hell is Totes Magee?

15:26.167 --> 15:28.651
"Curved" is just a gentle way
of turning you down.

15:28.670 --> 15:31.262
Like, did she offer
to give you her number?

15:31.489 --> 15:33.747
-No.
-Or ask for yours?

15:33.767 --> 15:36.492
Oh, no. (sniffles)

15:36.511 --> 15:39.228
I done been curved.

15:43.501 --> 15:44.591
Oh!

15:44.686 --> 15:46.185
(Phil cries)

15:46.279 --> 15:48.337
-Hey, Carter.
-Hey.

15:48.356 --> 15:49.672
Me and my friends want
to get some shots.

15:49.691 --> 15:52.617
Oh, okay. You got it.
Tequila? Whiskey?

15:52.768 --> 15:55.787
-Body.
-I'll be right over.

15:56.864 --> 15:58.939
I don't think
Randi would like this.

15:59.033 --> 16:00.533
I don't even know
why Randi's mad.

16:00.627 --> 16:01.942
I mean, this was her idea.

16:02.036 --> 16:04.128
Except for the penis straws.
That was all Darren.

16:04.355 --> 16:05.855
(Darren laughs)

16:05.948 --> 16:08.708
Carter, if I was lucky enough to
be dating someone who loves me,

16:08.860 --> 16:12.011
they'd always come first,
no matter what.

16:14.882 --> 16:16.199
Hey, Darren,

16:16.367 --> 16:18.701
I'm gonna need you to handle
three vodka body shots.

16:18.794 --> 16:20.627
Can't do it.

16:20.647 --> 16:21.887
Objectifies women.

16:22.040 --> 16:25.208
-They're doing 'em off of you.
-Oh, hell yeah!

16:26.044 --> 16:27.710
I can't get the new microwave
to turn on.

16:27.729 --> 16:29.988
Damn it. The airport sausage guy
promised me it worked.

16:30.139 --> 16:33.324
Man, I don't know
who to trust anymore!

16:36.329 --> 16:37.570
Kat.

16:37.664 --> 16:39.480
Max.

16:39.499 --> 16:41.982
I'm Phil,
and I'll take a Chardonnay.

16:42.002 --> 16:44.410
Didn't know
you still worked here.

16:44.504 --> 16:45.670
Helping out a friend.

16:45.897 --> 16:47.338
It's something I do.

16:47.490 --> 16:49.398
Most of my friends
appreciate it.

16:49.417 --> 16:51.676
I'd appreciate a Chardonnay.

16:51.827 --> 16:54.012
Good luck
with your sperm hunting.

16:54.163 --> 16:55.513
Oh, thank you.

16:55.664 --> 16:56.848
That was meant for Kat,

16:57.041 --> 16:58.499
-and it was meant to be mean.
-Oh.

16:58.518 --> 17:02.336
Joke's on you. I took it as a
sincere wish from a good friend!

17:02.430 --> 17:03.763
In your face!

17:03.915 --> 17:09.009
Oh, my God. Has my royal
drag queen finally arrived?

17:09.029 --> 17:10.987
Close. That's my mother.

17:12.198 --> 17:15.091
Hi. Thank you so much
for coming down to...

17:15.109 --> 17:17.426
-So you screwed it up with Max?
-...support me.

17:17.561 --> 17:21.355
Guess we should pour one out
for the end of the family line.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.766
Mother, he quit school, he
bummed around Europe for years.

17:23.785 --> 17:26.544
He's comfortable masturbating
in a trailer full of clowns.

17:26.695 --> 17:28.546
Oh, please, Katharine.

17:28.697 --> 17:30.864
In my dorm at Wellesley,

17:30.958 --> 17:33.367
you could barely sleep
over the din of vibrators.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.970
You'd think
it was a barber college.

17:39.041 --> 17:40.800
-(door opens)
-CARTER: Hey.

17:40.894 --> 17:43.061
-Hey.
-I only got a minute.

17:43.212 --> 17:44.970
I left Darren in charge, and
I bought the fire extinguishers

17:45.065 --> 17:47.381
from the airport sausage guy.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.733
What's up?

17:48.884 --> 17:49.901
I'm sorry.

17:50.128 --> 17:52.219
I knew you weren't happy
about Ladies' Night,

17:52.238 --> 17:53.905
and I had another one anyway.

17:54.132 --> 17:57.116
I should've cared more
about your feelings.

17:57.893 --> 17:59.744
I'm so pissed right now.

17:59.821 --> 18:02.229
What?! I-I just apologized.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.823
You can't get pissed.

18:03.917 --> 18:06.567
I even used the word "feelings."

18:06.628 --> 18:09.236
I'm pissed...
'cause I love you so much

18:09.255 --> 18:11.647
that I'm doing dumb stuff
like getting jealous.

18:11.666 --> 18:12.815
Ha! See, I knew
you were jealous.

18:12.834 --> 18:16.260
And... it brings me no joy.

18:16.412 --> 18:21.173
I guess I've never had someone
I cared about losing this much.

18:21.326 --> 18:23.509
Baby, you're not gonna lose me.

18:23.661 --> 18:24.844
You sure?

18:24.996 --> 18:26.938
Cross my hair, hope to die.

18:27.089 --> 18:29.607
(both laugh)

18:29.834 --> 18:32.017
Oh, well, do you have
to rush back to the bar,

18:32.170 --> 18:34.445
or can I get a few minutes
with Corky 95th?

18:34.597 --> 18:38.007
Oh, I should get you
pissed at me more often.

18:38.025 --> 18:40.100
(laughs)
Honestly, I'm just trying

18:40.120 --> 18:41.844
to make sure
I'm back in for Lobsterfest.

18:41.863 --> 18:43.996
-Yes. (laughs)
-(laughs)

18:48.294 --> 18:50.369
The bathroom's
out of toilet paper.

18:50.521 --> 18:52.613
Tina, you drank vodka
out of my belly button.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.298
I am not your husband.

18:55.193 --> 18:56.208
I'll grab some from the back.

18:56.361 --> 19:00.138
And, Tina, make better choices.

19:00.289 --> 19:02.365
Excuse me. Mind if I sit here?

19:02.458 --> 19:04.291
Be my guest.
I was just about to leave.

19:04.310 --> 19:08.980
That's a shame. I was hoping
you'd give me a clogging lesson.

19:09.056 --> 19:10.964
Your Majesty?

19:10.984 --> 19:13.818
She's off tonight.
You can call me Jalen.

19:13.928 --> 19:16.712
But I do love a good curtsy.

19:16.731 --> 19:19.240
(laughing):
Oh.

19:20.142 --> 19:22.885
Look how far down you can go.

19:22.904 --> 19:26.581
Oh, My Highness,
you ain't seen nothing yet.

19:31.820 --> 19:33.913
Seriously? One-ply?

19:34.007 --> 19:36.549
Might as well scoot
on the floor like a puppy.

19:38.994 --> 19:40.011
Oh.

19:40.238 --> 19:42.013
That seems to be for me.

19:42.164 --> 19:44.473
I probably shouldn't look.

19:47.836 --> 19:49.836
Oops!

19:49.931 --> 19:51.430
Kat?

19:51.524 --> 19:52.932
Oh, I-I didn't open it.
It just fell out.

19:53.026 --> 19:54.692
Shut up. It did.

19:54.919 --> 19:58.604
I was gonna give that to you
when I thought we were...

19:58.756 --> 20:00.606
You can just throw it away.

20:00.758 --> 20:02.758
This is from you?

20:02.777 --> 20:04.610
I had it made for the baby.

20:04.762 --> 20:07.371
You know. Silver. Kingbird.

20:07.598 --> 20:08.614
SilverBird.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.099
(laughs softly)

20:10.117 --> 20:12.435
"A SilverBird Production."

20:12.453 --> 20:14.620
Yeah, 'cause I was gonna be
the dad, and you were gonna

20:14.772 --> 20:16.272
be the...

20:16.290 --> 20:19.625
(sighs)
Well, you know how babies work.

20:19.794 --> 20:21.368
Wait. Max?

20:21.462 --> 20:23.012
Yeah.

20:23.965 --> 20:26.265
MAX:
Mmm.

20:28.119 --> 20:30.043
What was that for?

20:30.063 --> 20:32.212
I'm sorry for thinking

20:32.306 --> 20:36.025
that you wouldn't be the
perfect father for our child.

20:37.462 --> 20:38.644
Really?

20:38.738 --> 20:42.990
Or... just plain perfect.

20:49.657 --> 20:53.400
Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait.

20:53.419 --> 20:56.570
I can be bendy, too,
like those circus girls, so...

20:56.664 --> 20:59.331
Oh.

20:59.484 --> 21:00.983
You okay?

21:01.076 --> 21:03.219
That's a young woman's game.
