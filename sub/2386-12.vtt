WEBVTT

00:02.127 --> 00:03.311
Kids, have I ever told you

00:03.313 --> 00:05.596
the story
of how I met your father?

00:05.598 --> 00:06.897
Well, I'll just skip ahead

00:06.899 --> 00:09.433
to the moment I told him
I was pregnant.

00:10.936 --> 00:13.187
W... What happened?

00:13.189 --> 00:14.488
Did I pass out?

00:14.490 --> 00:16.274
Not exactly.

00:16.276 --> 00:18.409
I'm pregnant.

00:21.663 --> 00:24.448
Are you sure you're not
just getting fat?

00:26.451 --> 00:28.919
Oh, yeah.

00:28.921 --> 00:31.339
So, um, you're pregnant.

00:31.341 --> 00:32.372
Yeah.

00:32.375 --> 00:34.175
Huh.

00:34.177 --> 00:36.544
Looks like nobody told
your boobs.

00:38.680 --> 00:41.332
What happened?

00:41.334 --> 00:42.633
Did I pass out?

00:42.635 --> 00:43.384
Oh, my...

00:43.386 --> 00:44.501
Please stop hitting me!

00:44.503 --> 00:46.771
Hey.

00:46.773 --> 00:51.058
Are... Are you sure you're...

00:51.060 --> 00:52.977
Well, no, not positive.

00:52.979 --> 00:54.395
I'm a week late.

00:54.397 --> 00:56.614
But I'm never late;
it's a point of pride with me.

00:56.616 --> 00:57.681
I'm going to go

00:57.683 --> 00:59.867
see the doctor on Monday
to find out for sure.

00:59.869 --> 01:03.070
Until then, not a word
of this to anyone.

01:03.072 --> 01:04.288
Not even Kevin?

01:05.022 --> 01:07.958
I mean, it's probably his.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.827
I've spent years
training my boys

01:09.829 --> 01:11.212
to swim the other way.

01:11.214 --> 01:13.164
Kevin and I haven't had sex yet.

01:14.066 --> 01:16.533
If I'm pregnant, you're the dad.

01:18.387 --> 01:20.537
That's wonderful!

01:20.539 --> 01:21.722
Huh?

01:21.724 --> 01:23.674
I'm gonna be a daddy!

01:41.485 --> 01:43.912
Okay, one scotch for me,

01:43.913 --> 01:45.596
one iced tea on the rocks glass
for Mommy.

01:45.598 --> 01:46.547
Stop it.

01:46.549 --> 01:47.548
Sorry, sorry.

01:47.550 --> 01:48.599
Keeping it secret.

01:49.752 --> 01:52.253
Oop, I think I gave you
the wrong one.

01:52.255 --> 01:53.437
Here, let me just...

01:53.439 --> 01:55.389
Give it to me.
Drop... let go.

01:55.391 --> 01:58.726
Take it away from you.

01:59.611 --> 02:01.946
Barney, why are you
so happy about this?

02:01.948 --> 02:02.947
Because this is perfect.

02:02.949 --> 02:04.315
I want to be a dad.

02:04.317 --> 02:05.950
This is not good news.

02:05.952 --> 02:07.235
I have a boyfriend.

02:07.237 --> 02:09.152
Yeah, but if Kevin
weren't around...

02:09.155 --> 02:10.121
It doesn't matter!

02:10.122 --> 02:12.323
I don't want kids.

02:12.325 --> 02:13.541
I've never wanted kids,

02:13.543 --> 02:17.378
and never, in a million years,
will I ever want kids.

02:17.380 --> 02:20.047
Sorry, kids.

02:20.049 --> 02:22.383
I can't have a baby.

02:22.385 --> 02:23.467
Hey, guys!

02:23.469 --> 02:27.054
Guess what this is!

02:27.056 --> 02:29.290
One of your socks?
Boom! You're huge.

02:29.292 --> 02:32.459
No, it's our unborn son's
Christmas stocking.

02:32.461 --> 02:34.011
Grandma Gunderson
started knitting it

02:34.013 --> 02:36.397
the day Lily and I got married.

02:36.399 --> 02:40.401
She died before
she could finish.

02:40.403 --> 02:41.435
I miss stockings.

02:41.437 --> 02:43.404
My stepdad Clint
made us get rid of anything

02:43.406 --> 02:46.140
that reminds him of the
commercialization of Christmas.

02:46.142 --> 02:48.492
I thought you said he
dresses up as Santa.

02:48.494 --> 02:51.195
Yeah, but, uh,
to protest gender stereotypes,

02:51.197 --> 02:52.580
he plays Santa as a woman.

02:52.582 --> 02:54.198
Though, he keeps the beard.

02:54.200 --> 02:57.535
The result is disturbing.

02:57.537 --> 02:58.836
Well, we should go.

02:58.838 --> 03:00.788
We have to get
to We B Babies

03:00.790 --> 03:03.040
so that we can register
for our shower.

03:03.042 --> 03:04.325
No can do.

03:04.327 --> 03:08.429
Um, I have a big project
that I'm working on.

03:08.431 --> 03:12.383
This is Richard Holdman's house
in East Meadow.

03:12.385 --> 03:15.636
Last year, he had the
most visited Christmas display

03:15.638 --> 03:16.887
in the tri-state area.

03:16.889 --> 03:18.773
But not this year.
You know why?

03:18.775 --> 03:21.508
Because Big Fudge
has come to town,

03:21.510 --> 03:23.527
and he brought his two friends:

03:23.529 --> 03:26.013
Mannim... Steamroller.

03:26.015 --> 03:27.014
Game on.

03:28.184 --> 03:29.033
Are you okay?

03:29.035 --> 03:30.184
Yeah.

03:30.186 --> 03:32.453
Uh, it's just, um...

03:32.455 --> 03:34.572
I hate Mannheim
Steamroller.

03:34.574 --> 03:36.324
Isn't there anyone
else you can use?

03:36.326 --> 03:39.477
Come on! Who am I gonna use
if not the Steamroller?!

03:39.479 --> 03:41.495
I don't know. AC/DC?

03:41.497 --> 03:43.347
AC/DC?

03:43.349 --> 03:45.499
Robin, do you have any idea

03:45.501 --> 03:48.135
why they call them
Mannheim Steamroller?

03:48.137 --> 03:52.390
Because they rock... so hard,
so festively,

03:52.392 --> 03:56.761
that steam comes out
of your brain.

03:56.763 --> 03:58.479
As it melts.

03:58.481 --> 04:01.215
So I have to go to
We B Babies by myself?

04:01.217 --> 04:03.050
Robin and I will
go with you.

04:05.387 --> 04:07.738
Barney, what are
we doing here?

04:07.740 --> 04:09.890
I want to show you
that having a kid

04:09.892 --> 04:11.442
is nothing to be afraid of.

04:12.912 --> 04:15.413
Kids. Stop.

04:18.083 --> 04:19.750
Okay, first
on the registry:

04:19.752 --> 04:20.785
nipple butter.

04:20.786 --> 04:21.735
Uh-oh.

04:21.737 --> 04:22.870
As you breast-feed,

04:22.872 --> 04:24.738
your nipples stretch out,
like, four inches

04:24.740 --> 04:26.290
and get all dry and cracked.

04:26.292 --> 04:28.092
The nipple butter
stops the bleeding.

04:29.928 --> 04:33.097
My four-inch nipples are
going to crack and bleed?!

04:33.099 --> 04:36.884
Yes, but while the baby is
gnawing on your bleeding nips,

04:36.886 --> 04:39.753
look what she'll be wearing.

04:44.142 --> 04:47.094
Insane Duane?

04:48.997 --> 04:50.531
Barney?

04:50.533 --> 04:53.284
<i>Insane Duane was your father's</i>
<i>best friend,</i>

04:53.286 --> 04:56.537
<i>back in the days before</i>
<i>he met me or your Uncle Ted.</i>

04:58.407 --> 04:59.907
We're going back to her place.

04:59.909 --> 05:00.908
Boom!

05:00.910 --> 05:02.410
All right, you win!

05:02.412 --> 05:04.778
Here's 20 for picking up a girl
with only one word.

05:04.780 --> 05:06.780
And here's another 20
for that word being "boner."

05:06.782 --> 05:08.416
Thank you.

05:08.418 --> 05:13.120
I'll meet you back here in an
hour when I'm done with, uh...

05:14.122 --> 05:15.556
Ah, who cares what her name is;
she won't be

05:15.558 --> 05:16.640
around long enough
for it to matter.

05:17.760 --> 05:19.009
Nice!

05:21.813 --> 05:24.849
Shh...

05:24.851 --> 05:26.684
I can't believe
I haven't seen you around.

05:26.686 --> 05:29.603
Well, after Sheila and I
had that quickie,

05:29.605 --> 05:34.241
my life's been playdates,
preschools and poops.

05:34.243 --> 05:36.160
I haven't set foot
in a bar in years.

05:36.162 --> 05:37.828
You stopped drinking?

05:37.830 --> 05:40.781
Oh, I still drink.

05:42.284 --> 05:44.168
Vaginal
numbing spray.

05:44.170 --> 05:45.753
Apparently, after child birth,

05:45.755 --> 05:48.372
your hoo-ha looks like
Rocky Balboa's face.

05:48.374 --> 05:51.425
- You can't have a baby!
- I can't have a baby!

05:52.360 --> 05:54.995
<i>The next day,</i>
<i>we went to the doctor.</i>

05:54.997 --> 05:56.347
Well, Mrs. Scherbatsky,

05:56.349 --> 05:58.332
I'm sure that you
and your husband...

05:58.334 --> 05:59.767
Uh, he's not my husband.

05:59.769 --> 06:00.718
Oh, I'm so sorry.

06:00.720 --> 06:01.835
Your boyfriend then.

06:01.837 --> 06:02.803
He's not my boyfriend.

06:02.805 --> 06:03.971
<i>Oh, bozhe.</i>

06:03.973 --> 06:05.973
All right, well,
I will just cut to the chase.

06:05.975 --> 06:07.024
Wait! Wait.

06:07.026 --> 06:09.676
All right.

06:09.678 --> 06:11.111
Okay.

06:11.113 --> 06:12.279
All right, we're ready. Good.

06:12.281 --> 06:14.615
Um, you: not pregnant.

06:14.617 --> 06:16.183
Yeah!

06:16.185 --> 06:17.568
- Oh, yeah!
- Yeah!

06:17.570 --> 06:19.520
That's what I'm
talking about!

06:22.875 --> 06:24.708
Yeah, you know,
you know!

06:24.710 --> 06:27.194
Again, sorry kids.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.030
Hey, mister.

06:30.032 --> 06:32.082
Are you putting up
all these Christmas lights?

06:32.084 --> 06:34.368
Oh, kid, by the time I'm done,

06:34.370 --> 06:37.338
you're gonna be able to see this
son of a bitch from outer space.

06:37.340 --> 06:39.256
Ah, cool.

06:39.258 --> 06:41.342
I wanted to put lights
on our house,

06:41.344 --> 06:44.595
but my dad says he's too busy
with work and stuff.

06:46.398 --> 06:50.818
Hey, what do you say, uh,
you come back here next weekend

06:50.820 --> 06:52.186
and help me out?

06:52.188 --> 06:53.237
Yeah!

06:53.239 --> 06:55.055
You've got yourself a deal.

06:55.057 --> 06:56.390
I'm Scott.

06:56.392 --> 06:59.726
I'm... Mr. Eriksen.

06:59.728 --> 07:01.111
Thanks, Mr. E.

07:04.199 --> 07:05.783
Mr. E.

07:05.785 --> 07:08.085
Looks like some little scamp
just earned the right

07:08.087 --> 07:10.120
to put the Vikings helmet
on baby Jesus.

07:12.173 --> 07:15.175
<i>Later that week,</i>
<i>as I was enjoying every second</i>

07:15.177 --> 07:16.677
<i>of not being pregnant...</i>

07:16.679 --> 07:18.245
Next on <i>Teenage Mommies...</i>

07:18.247 --> 07:20.514
But you said
you would watch Bella.

07:20.516 --> 07:22.383
I have cheerleading practice.

07:23.752 --> 07:25.619
Sucks to be you, Braces.

07:26.606 --> 07:28.973
Oh. Um...

07:28.975 --> 07:30.608
Yello!

07:32.394 --> 07:35.062
Uh, yeah, I can come back in.

07:35.064 --> 07:38.365
Robin, we ran some
tests last week.

07:38.367 --> 07:42.570
This is going to be
difficult to hear.

07:42.572 --> 07:46.373
<i>And then the doctor said a</i>
<i>bunch of medical stuff that...</i>

07:46.375 --> 07:49.293
<i>well, the gist of it was this.</i>

07:49.295 --> 07:51.462
I can't have a baby.

07:56.317 --> 07:58.651
No. You can't have a baby.

08:01.440 --> 08:02.457
Uh, great.

08:02.459 --> 08:07.279
Uh, well, I mean,
um, not-not great.

08:07.281 --> 08:08.363
I mean, I've never wanted kids,

08:08.365 --> 08:10.482
so if it has to happen
to someone...

08:10.484 --> 08:14.236
Robin, is there anyone
you can talk to about this?

08:14.238 --> 08:15.871
Perhaps a close friend?

08:15.873 --> 08:18.206
<i>I knew I could have</i>
<i>talked to my friends.</i>

08:18.208 --> 08:20.041
<i>But, it's just, I already knew</i>

08:20.043 --> 08:22.127
<i>exactly how</i>
<i>they would all react.</i>

08:22.129 --> 08:25.163
<i>Ted would go into overdrive</i>
<i>trying to make me feel better.</i>

08:25.165 --> 08:26.548
You need comfort food.

08:26.550 --> 08:28.900
Fried chicken, mac and cheese,
mashed potatoes.

08:28.902 --> 08:30.752
Open your present,
I'll work on these shoulders.

08:30.754 --> 08:33.121
Okay, just breathe,
relax, eat your chicken.

08:33.123 --> 08:34.840
Come on,
eat, breathe,

08:34.842 --> 08:37.058
open it, breathe,
open it, eat.

08:37.059 --> 08:38.626
Robin, why are you so tense?!

08:39.563 --> 08:41.563
<i>Lily would just implode.</i>

08:41.565 --> 08:45.800
And here I've been going
on and on about babies.

08:45.802 --> 08:50.071
Oh, I am such a bad friend!

08:51.741 --> 08:53.775
<i>And I'd wind up comforting her.</i>

08:53.777 --> 08:54.743
It's okay.

08:54.745 --> 08:57.645
You have to punch
me in the face!

08:57.647 --> 08:59.948
<i>Marshall would ask me</i>
<i>a ton of questions</i>

08:59.950 --> 09:01.499
<i>I don't know the answers to.</i>

09:01.501 --> 09:03.652
- Have you thought about adoption?
- Um, well...

09:03.654 --> 09:05.337
Does this kind of thing
run in your family?

09:05.339 --> 09:06.171
Uh...

09:06.173 --> 09:07.205
What was the date, duration

09:07.207 --> 09:10.008
and consistency
of your last period?

09:10.010 --> 09:12.627
<i>And your father would</i>
<i>bend over backwards</i>

09:12.629 --> 09:14.095
<i>trying to make me laugh.</i>

09:14.097 --> 09:16.497
A priest and a rabbi
walk into a bar--

09:16.499 --> 09:18.850
no, a barbershop--
no, a post office--

09:18.852 --> 09:21.386
no, it's two priests--
no, it's two ducks--

09:21.388 --> 09:23.671
no, a priest holding a duck--
and he's Polish.

09:23.673 --> 09:24.973
The priest, not the duck.

09:24.975 --> 09:26.641
Actually, the duck
could be Polish, too.

09:26.643 --> 09:27.859
Doesn't matter.

09:27.861 --> 09:29.694
Yes it does.
The duck's not Polish.

09:29.696 --> 09:30.779
<i>And when that didn't work,</i>

09:30.781 --> 09:32.948
<i>he would actually</i>
<i>bend over backwards.</i>

09:32.950 --> 09:34.583
Pratfall!

09:34.585 --> 09:36.134
Ow!

09:36.136 --> 09:39.520
<i>The bottom line is, I didn't</i>
<i>feel like talking about it.</i>

09:39.522 --> 09:41.656
<i>So when Ted asked...</i>

09:41.658 --> 09:43.575
Hey, Robin, you okay?
You look upset.

09:43.577 --> 09:46.962
<i>I just came up with the first</i>
<i>lie that popped into my head.</i>

09:46.964 --> 09:48.997
Yeah. Uh...

09:48.999 --> 09:51.633
I just found out I can never...

09:51.635 --> 09:55.253
be a pole-vaulter
for the Canadian Olympic team.

09:55.255 --> 09:57.389
I'm too tall or something.

09:57.391 --> 09:58.556
Robin, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, Robin.

09:58.558 --> 09:59.591
I had no idea.
That's terrible.

09:59.593 --> 10:01.509
Can we get some fried chicken
over here, stat!

10:01.511 --> 10:04.596
I am such a
bad friend!

10:04.598 --> 10:06.514
Three slutty nuns
show up at St. Peter's--

10:06.516 --> 10:07.816
Wait, wait, they're not slutty.

10:07.818 --> 10:09.567
Well, they are, but you're not
supposed to know that yet.

10:09.569 --> 10:10.718
Um...

10:10.720 --> 10:12.053
Hey, baby, what's up?

10:12.055 --> 10:14.389
Hey, uh, listen,
the construction of

10:14.391 --> 10:16.024
the Symphony of Illumination
is taking

10:16.026 --> 10:17.242
a little longer than I thought.

10:17.244 --> 10:19.277
Good thing I have
Scott here to help me.

10:19.279 --> 10:20.412
Right, Scott?

10:20.414 --> 10:22.080
You betcha, Mr. E!

10:22.082 --> 10:22.914
Bad news.

10:22.916 --> 10:23.949
Robin's too tall

10:23.951 --> 10:25.733
to be an Olympic
pole-vaulter.

10:25.735 --> 10:27.369
Has she filed an appeal
with the IOC?

10:27.371 --> 10:28.837
Have you filed
an appeal with the IOC?

10:28.839 --> 10:30.789
Can she make herself shorter
by slouching?

10:30.791 --> 10:32.173
Can you make yourself
shorter by slouching?

10:32.175 --> 10:33.458
Has she considered
going back to school

10:33.460 --> 10:34.709
and competing at
the collegiate level?

10:34.711 --> 10:36.594
Have you considered
going back to school and...

10:36.596 --> 10:38.046
I don't want to talk about it.

10:38.048 --> 10:39.965
Sorry.

10:39.967 --> 10:41.800
I love you, baby.
See you tomorrow.

10:41.802 --> 10:43.301
Okay, I love you, too.

10:46.256 --> 10:47.272
Scott?

10:47.274 --> 10:48.640
Scott, I dropped my phone.

10:48.642 --> 10:50.108
Yep, found it.

10:50.110 --> 10:51.393
Could you bring it up here?

10:51.395 --> 10:52.694
You got it.

10:52.696 --> 10:55.196
Hey, while I'm at it,
can I get you a beer?

10:55.198 --> 10:58.616
He wants to bring
the old man a beer.

10:58.618 --> 10:59.734
Yeah, sure.

10:59.736 --> 11:01.486
Uh, there's a whole case
in the fridge.

11:01.488 --> 11:02.654
Thanks, son.

11:02.656 --> 11:05.540
Do you, do you mind
if I call you "son"?

11:05.542 --> 11:07.659
You can call me
whatever you want...

11:07.661 --> 11:09.461
jackass.

11:13.132 --> 11:14.449
Scott?

11:14.451 --> 11:15.917
The ladder fell.

11:16.752 --> 11:19.120
Scott?

11:23.225 --> 11:25.477
♪ ♪

11:33.686 --> 11:35.303
Scott!

11:35.305 --> 11:38.123
What are we doing?

11:40.642 --> 11:42.477
Listen, um,

11:42.479 --> 11:44.129
I know things have been
kind of weird

11:44.131 --> 11:45.947
between you and me
these past couple weeks,

11:45.949 --> 11:47.332
so I just want to say I'm...

11:47.334 --> 11:48.917
I'm glad we're back
to where we started.

11:48.919 --> 11:50.651
- Yeah.
- Friends with benefits.

11:50.653 --> 11:51.953
- No.
- Just like always.

11:51.955 --> 11:53.288
Never been that.
Just friends.

11:53.290 --> 11:55.173
With benefits.
We'll talk about it later.

11:55.958 --> 11:58.209
Look at all
these babies.

11:58.211 --> 12:00.211
Isn't it crazy how,
now that we're not having one,

12:00.213 --> 12:01.679
babies are cute again?

12:02.498 --> 12:04.049
Look at that one.

12:04.051 --> 12:05.083
I'm good.

12:05.085 --> 12:06.834
No, I'm serious.
Look, look.

12:06.836 --> 12:08.436
Damn it.

12:08.438 --> 12:10.638
That thing's cute as crap.

12:12.174 --> 12:13.808
Screw you, baby.

12:15.528 --> 12:17.312
Scott?

12:17.314 --> 12:18.513
Scott!

12:18.515 --> 12:20.532
What is going on?

12:20.534 --> 12:22.233
Hey, Mr. E.
Scott...

12:22.235 --> 12:24.986
if you do not let me down,
I am going to scream

12:24.988 --> 12:26.871
my head off until someone
comes to help me,

12:26.873 --> 12:30.208
and then you're going to have to
explain all of this to the cops.

12:30.210 --> 12:31.859
And then you'll have to explain
why there's

12:31.861 --> 12:34.329
a picture of my ding-dong
on your phone.

12:34.331 --> 12:35.830
There is no picture of your...

12:35.832 --> 12:38.216
There is now.

12:38.218 --> 12:40.218
Oh, yeah, that's a beauty.

12:40.220 --> 12:41.419
Scott?

12:41.421 --> 12:43.204
Scott!

12:44.090 --> 12:46.057
Scott!

12:46.059 --> 12:47.559
Marshall keeps

12:47.561 --> 12:50.562
asking me to text him
pictures of my boobies.

12:50.564 --> 12:52.347
After all these years,

12:52.349 --> 12:55.233
he sometimes still acts
like a teenager.

12:55.235 --> 12:56.734
I'll be right back.

13:01.907 --> 13:04.826
Insane Duane.

13:04.828 --> 13:07.996
It's Sane Duane now.

13:07.998 --> 13:10.365
You used to be
magnificent.

13:18.457 --> 13:20.542
Are you okay?

13:20.544 --> 13:24.429
Yeah, yeah, um,
I guess this, um,

13:24.431 --> 13:28.099
this pole-vaulting thing
is finally hitting me.

13:28.101 --> 13:29.184
I don't get it, Robin.

13:29.186 --> 13:31.886
Did you really want
to be a pole-vaulter?

13:31.888 --> 13:35.590
No, no, I was,
uh, I was always

13:35.592 --> 13:38.026
adamantly against having a...

13:38.028 --> 13:40.311
uh, a pole-vaulting career,

13:40.313 --> 13:42.430
even though it's
what most women want.

13:42.432 --> 13:44.816
Most women want
to be a pole-vaulter?

13:44.818 --> 13:46.985
In Canada--
it's very big up there.

13:46.987 --> 13:48.653
You know, it's,
it's meet a nice guy,

13:48.655 --> 13:51.456
get married, vault some poles,

13:51.458 --> 13:52.891
but I...

13:52.893 --> 13:55.460
never wanted that.

13:55.462 --> 13:57.778
Of course, it's one thing
not to want something.

13:57.780 --> 14:00.131
It's another to be told
you can't have it.

14:01.500 --> 14:03.218
I guess it's,
it's just nice knowing

14:03.220 --> 14:08.306
that you could someday do it
if you changed your mind.

14:09.742 --> 14:13.678
But now, all of a sudden,
that door is closed.

14:15.981 --> 14:19.417
What about the one where you ski
and shoot at the same time?

14:19.419 --> 14:21.653
That seems like something
you'd be good at.

14:23.189 --> 14:25.973
Oh, my God, Robin, look at this.

14:25.975 --> 14:27.659
O Cana-dorable!

14:27.661 --> 14:28.660
Am I right?

14:28.662 --> 14:30.195
Excuse me.

14:30.963 --> 14:33.665
Yep, this works.

14:37.922 --> 14:39.593
Scott, when I get

14:39.594 --> 14:40.893
down from here, you are going

14:40.895 --> 14:43.312
to be in big, big trouble,
mister.

14:43.314 --> 14:44.680
Come on, Mr. E.

14:44.682 --> 14:47.099
Didn't you ever cut loose
when you were a kid?

14:47.101 --> 14:49.518
That's irrelevant.

14:49.520 --> 14:51.937
I mean, of course I did.

14:51.939 --> 14:54.156
One time, when my parents
were out of town,

14:54.158 --> 14:58.244
my brothers and I set
the basement on fire

14:58.246 --> 15:01.447
hosting
an amateur wrestling exhibition.

15:02.565 --> 15:04.917
There were some theatrics.

15:04.919 --> 15:07.286
See, you get me.

15:07.288 --> 15:10.456
I don't think of you as some
dummy I trapped on the roof.

15:10.458 --> 15:14.627
I think of you more like,
like my dad.

15:16.046 --> 15:20.266
Can we keep the party going
for 30 more minutes, please?

15:22.886 --> 15:24.887
Okay, Scott.

15:24.889 --> 15:27.556
Thanks, Pop.

15:29.276 --> 15:33.145
It's fine, kid just needed
to blow off some steam.

15:40.436 --> 15:41.453
No!

15:41.455 --> 15:44.623
Grandma Gunderson knitted that!

15:44.625 --> 15:48.244
Scott...!

15:48.246 --> 15:49.628
That was crazy.

15:49.630 --> 15:51.964
She just ran
out of there crying.

15:51.966 --> 15:53.465
Now she's not
answering her phone.

15:53.467 --> 15:56.418
She's been acting really weird
for a few weeks now,

15:56.420 --> 16:00.422
really since the night
we discussed the hurricane.

16:00.424 --> 16:01.790
Barney, you split a cab home.

16:01.792 --> 16:03.342
Did she say anything?

16:06.313 --> 16:08.297
We didn't really talk much.

16:08.299 --> 16:09.398
Well, lucky for us,

16:09.400 --> 16:12.318
someone at this table is skilled

16:12.320 --> 16:15.070
in the art of detection.

16:15.855 --> 16:17.489
Robin's upset.

16:17.491 --> 16:20.326
She and Kevin
are having trouble.

16:20.328 --> 16:22.144
- He cheated on her.
- No way.

16:22.146 --> 16:25.831
Kevin's an honest, decent guy
who never on his best day

16:25.833 --> 16:27.816
could pull a hotter chick
than Robin.

16:27.818 --> 16:29.668
Maybe Robin cheated on him.

16:29.670 --> 16:33.488
Maybe Robin is the dirty bird
who slept with someone else.

16:33.490 --> 16:35.758
I don't know,
this pole-vaulting thing seems

16:35.760 --> 16:37.659
like a slam dunk to me.

16:37.661 --> 16:39.595
Oh, it is so obvious.

16:39.597 --> 16:40.930
Barney.

16:41.831 --> 16:43.015
What is the name of that guy

16:43.017 --> 16:44.683
you worked with-- uh, Randy?

16:44.685 --> 16:45.884
It was Randy.

16:45.886 --> 16:46.852
Wait a second.

16:46.854 --> 16:49.021
I just cracked this case.

16:50.274 --> 16:51.673
The little maple leaf onesie.

16:51.675 --> 16:53.609
<i>It made her homesick.</i>

16:53.611 --> 16:54.560
That's why she's so upset.

16:54.562 --> 16:55.644
She's not going home
for Christmas.

16:55.646 --> 16:58.147
She wants me
to invite her to Ohio.

16:58.149 --> 17:00.015
That's got to be it!

17:00.017 --> 17:02.067
Either that
or she slept with Barney.

17:15.248 --> 17:17.800
Oh, you must be Scott.

17:17.801 --> 17:20.219
Oh, hello, ma'am.

17:20.221 --> 17:22.554
It's nice to finally
see your face.

17:22.556 --> 17:25.057
Well, I'd better go
hit those books.

17:25.059 --> 17:28.542
Hold it right there, young man.

17:29.346 --> 17:32.147
This is for helping out
my husband.

17:32.983 --> 17:35.651
Wow, 50 bucks.

17:35.653 --> 17:36.819
Merry Christmas.

17:45.745 --> 17:48.414
Lily!

17:48.416 --> 17:50.616
An airplane ticket
to Cleveland?

17:50.618 --> 17:52.618
I know it's not Canada,
but it starts with a "C"

17:52.620 --> 17:55.037
and it's cold as balls,
so get packed.

17:55.039 --> 17:56.755
You're coming home
with me for Christmas.

17:56.757 --> 17:58.507
Yeah, nice try, dude.

17:58.509 --> 17:59.541
I wouldn't go to Cleveland

17:59.543 --> 18:03.245
for $125 million
paid over six years.

18:03.247 --> 18:04.263
Still?

18:04.265 --> 18:05.848
Still with the LeBron jokes?

18:05.850 --> 18:07.099
Where's that ring, huh?

18:07.101 --> 18:09.101
Where's that ring
he's supposed to have by now?

18:09.969 --> 18:11.753
Look, I just-- I thought
you were bummed

18:11.755 --> 18:13.305
about not going home
for Christmas.

18:13.307 --> 18:14.423
Are you kidding?

18:14.425 --> 18:16.775
I love New York at Christmas.

18:16.777 --> 18:19.111
It's so quiet and peaceful.

18:20.196 --> 18:22.614
Got my eggnog to keep
me company, so...

18:22.616 --> 18:24.900
Robin, what's wrong?

18:24.902 --> 18:26.952
- Nothing.
- Just tell me.

18:26.954 --> 18:28.570
Why do you need
to know so bad?

18:28.572 --> 18:29.738
So I can cheer you up.

18:29.740 --> 18:31.273
It's not your job
to cheer me up.

18:31.275 --> 18:32.241
Yes, it is.

18:32.243 --> 18:34.326
Cheering you up is my job.

18:34.328 --> 18:36.161
Well, then, you're fired.

18:36.163 --> 18:37.162
You can't fire me.

18:37.164 --> 18:38.447
I'm union, bitch.

18:38.449 --> 18:39.915
It's not your job
to cheer me up.

18:39.917 --> 18:40.966
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

18:40.968 --> 18:41.884
Yes, it is.

18:41.886 --> 18:43.452
No, it's not.

18:45.388 --> 18:47.789
Merry Christmas, Ted.

18:48.641 --> 18:50.843
Merry Christmas.

18:53.396 --> 18:57.766
<i>So, kids, I settled in</i>
<i>for a Christmas alone.</i>

18:57.768 --> 19:00.569
<i>I appreciated that Ted wanted</i>
<i>to cheer me up,</i>

19:00.571 --> 19:03.472
<i>but honestly,</i>
<i>it wasn't necessary.</i>

19:03.474 --> 19:05.441
<i>So I can't have kids.</i>

19:05.443 --> 19:07.192
<i>Big deal.</i>

19:07.194 --> 19:09.611
<i>This way there's no one</i>
<i>to hold me back in life,</i>

19:09.613 --> 19:11.246
<i>no one to keep me</i>
<i>from traveling</i>

19:11.248 --> 19:12.647
<i>where I want to travel,</i>

19:12.649 --> 19:14.500
<i>no one getting</i>
<i>in the way of my career.</i>

19:14.502 --> 19:17.319
<i>If you want to know</i>
<i>the truth of it,</i>

19:17.321 --> 19:20.155
<i>I'm glad you guys aren't real.</i>

19:33.970 --> 19:36.171
Really glad.

19:53.206 --> 19:55.374
Damn it.

19:56.527 --> 20:00.062
("Highway to Hell" by AC/DC
playing)

20:08.805 --> 20:11.706
Yes, it is.

20:12.875 --> 20:15.928
Look, you don't want to
tell me what's wrong, fine.

20:15.930 --> 20:17.229
I don't need to know.

20:18.331 --> 20:21.049
But you can never stop me
from trying to cheer you up.

20:22.018 --> 20:23.101
It's a fact of life.

20:23.103 --> 20:25.487
You're just gonna
have to deal with it.
