I had an extremely handsome
brother,

I was like an elf,

05:46.614 --> 05:49.082

the attention from the mother

Welcome.
Benvenuto.

Thank you.

One of the greatest filmmakers

You have deep roots here.

06:21.314 --> 06:25.419
My grandfather always told
us stories of Bernalda,

06:25.453 --> 06:26.787
Bernalda Bella.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.789
And oddly enough,
he never had gone back

06:28.822 --> 06:32.292
once he left
as an American immigrant.

06:32.325 --> 06:34.862
But it became mythical to me.

06:34.895 --> 06:39.132
The story is that the family
originally came from Lecce,

06:39.166 --> 06:41.134
and someone got
the sister pregnant,

06:41.168 --> 06:42.870
and they killed her.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.072
And then they became briganti,

06:45.105 --> 06:47.307
so they were one step
ahead of the law.

06:47.340 --> 06:51.078
And then they settled down
and became laborers

06:51.111 --> 06:52.913
in the olive fields.

06:52.946 --> 06:56.750
And that's really the origins
of the Coppola family.

06:56.784 --> 07:00.588
Because the south was
so oppressed by the north,

07:00.621 --> 07:02.490
it stayed the same.

07:02.523 --> 07:05.793
They haven't had 1,000 years
of cheap, "gyp the tourist."

07:05.826 --> 07:07.521
And you come, and you can walk
out in the street,

07:07.528 --> 07:09.329
and you're in
a real Italian town

07:09.362 --> 07:11.298

anything about...

07:11.331 --> 07:12.859

to the house for dinner here

Your grandfather
was boning the help here?

07:44.231 --> 07:45.165

07:45.198 --> 07:46.767
You know... heard that story.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.670
My grandfather was...
They called him zumpa balcone.

07:49.703 --> 07:50.871
He was girl crazy.

07:50.904 --> 07:54.675
And he would go up on the roof

07:54.708 --> 07:59.112
and go down to where
the maid was, Palmetta,

07:59.146 --> 08:02.349
and conduct this affair.

08:02.382 --> 08:04.552
And so when I found this place
years later,

08:04.585 --> 08:08.021
there was, in fact, a roof
leading to a housemaid's.

08:08.055 --> 08:12.660

that was where it happened.

the one-time manor house

08:54.434 --> 08:56.103
of those who lorded over them

08:56.136 --> 08:57.905
while they worked in the fields.

08:57.938 --> 09:01.541
During Mussolini time,
every town had a podestà,

09:01.575 --> 09:03.443
the official
of the fascist party.

09:03.476 --> 09:04.612
Right.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.279
And this family was the podestà.

09:06.313 --> 09:11.118
The ladies here were
so, you know, snobby.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.419
We are low-class Italians.

09:12.452 --> 09:15.388
They were
more high-class Italians.

09:15.422 --> 09:17.758
It took years and a lot of money

09:17.791 --> 09:21.294
converting the once-grand
but decaying mansion

09:21.328 --> 09:23.396
into a boutique hotel.

09:23.430 --> 09:25.132
You know, when you bought
this place,

09:25.165 --> 09:27.635
is there a sense of vengeance?

09:27.668 --> 09:29.737
I... you know, by then,

09:29.770 --> 09:32.640
"The Godfather" had come out
40 years ago.

09:32.673 --> 09:34.642
No, no, I mean, look.
It's not about the film.

09:34.675 --> 09:38.912
It's about...
a historical correction.

09:38.946 --> 09:40.247
There's a saying.

09:40.280 --> 09:42.650
You know what
Italian Alzheimer's is?

09:42.683 --> 09:43.984
Do you know what it is?

09:44.017 --> 09:46.153
You forget everything
but the grudge.

09:47.688 --> 09:50.323
This is the only
internal garden in Basilicata.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.325
I don't think
any of the normal people

09:52.359 --> 09:53.927
had ever been permitted
to visit it.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.462
Right.

09:55.495 --> 09:57.230
So I was happy
that normal people

09:57.264 --> 10:00.233
were gonna be here.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.269
"The Godfather" was a weird
experience in my life,

10:02.302 --> 10:04.905
because it was so much
more successful

10:04.938 --> 10:07.641
than I could have ever
anticipated

10:07.675 --> 10:10.510
so that I became well-known
around the world

10:10.543 --> 10:13.180
in ways that was
almost embarrassing.

10:13.213 --> 10:14.447
And so when I came here,

10:14.481 --> 10:16.316
they made me
an honorary citizen,

10:16.349 --> 10:19.519
and they had the little
schoolchildren out in a parade.

10:19.552 --> 10:21.955
And if I think about it,
as a new kid in a school,

10:21.989 --> 10:24.758
my greatest fear
was embarrassment.

10:24.792 --> 10:27.427
"Oh, here's Francis.
He's a new student."

10:27.460 --> 10:29.329
"Oh, Francis is a girl's name."

10:29.362 --> 10:31.932
I was embarrassed
in front of everyone,

10:31.965 --> 10:33.433
and I was a total outsider.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.968
And then when I became...

10:35.002 --> 10:36.536
On the other side
of "The Godfather,"

10:36.569 --> 10:39.439
when I became so well-known,
I was also an outsider.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.208
So I've always been an outsider.

10:41.241 --> 10:42.876
What's in there?

10:42.910 --> 10:45.645

10:48.749 --> 10:50.350
It's all there.

10:50.383 --> 10:51.745

a whole lamb's head?

10:51.752 --> 10:54.054
Oh, look at this.
Here we go.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.315
Come on out.
Oh, that's very good.

and a big party.

38:29.708 --> 38:31.877
But I'm not going.

38:31.910 --> 38:33.845
All right.

38:33.879 --> 38:37.349
You don't want to go see
the fiesta with the saints?

38:37.383 --> 38:39.017
No.

38:39.050 --> 38:40.519
I do not.

38:40.552 --> 38:42.554
- I'm named after a saint.
- Ah.

38:42.588 --> 38:43.789
But I have...

38:43.822 --> 38:45.824
Which Anthony?
Which Antonio?

38:45.857 --> 38:47.659
One who loves animals.

38:47.693 --> 38:49.395
- No.
- Cooked animals.

38:51.229 --> 38:55.534
But with Antonio,
there's Antonio who loves kids.

38:55.567 --> 38:56.702
I like kids.

38:58.003 --> 39:00.506
Not cooked.

39:00.539 --> 39:03.308
So you have been reading up
on St. Peter.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.143
I've been reading up
on St. Paul.

39:05.176 --> 39:06.978
You know, two people
who were brutally...

39:07.012 --> 39:09.247
One was crucified upside down,
Peter.

39:09.280 --> 39:10.749
My guy had his head lopped off.

39:10.782 --> 39:12.150
Oh, he was beheaded.

39:12.183 --> 39:13.852
- He was beheaded.
- For certain.

39:13.885 --> 39:15.754
St. Paul wasn't, like,
a nice guy.

39:15.787 --> 39:17.055
No, he was terrible.

39:17.088 --> 39:18.557
He was in charge

39:18.590 --> 39:19.951
of persecuting heretics
and Christians.

39:19.958 --> 39:21.393
Yeah.

39:21.427 --> 39:23.228
Anyways, he's on his way
to Damascus

39:23.261 --> 39:26.264
to torture the [...]
out of some more Christians,

39:26.297 --> 39:29.501
and he experiences
a blinding light.

39:29.535 --> 39:30.769
He goes blind.

39:30.802 --> 39:32.604
And what does the voice say?

39:32.638 --> 39:34.406
"I am Jesus, your lord.

39:34.440 --> 39:35.941
"You're torturing Christians.

39:35.974 --> 39:38.043
Like, you shall stop."

39:38.076 --> 39:40.412
Yeah, "Get on board.
Get on the Jesus train."

39:40.446 --> 39:43.281
And then a few days later,
the scales fell from his eyes.

39:43.314 --> 39:45.917
Yes, but the scales
is like prosciutto.

39:45.951 --> 39:48.620
Like, he had prosciutto
in front of his eyes,

39:48.654 --> 39:50.021
and it fell down.

39:50.055 --> 39:53.124
And then he was like, "Oh."
He was...

39:53.158 --> 39:54.960
- You're making me hungry.
- It was a miracle.

39:56.428 --> 39:58.029
Oh, wow.

39:58.063 --> 39:59.798
As important

39:59.831 --> 40:02.033
as religion, folklore,
and history are to me,

40:02.067 --> 40:03.769
you know what's more important?

40:03.802 --> 40:05.370
Dinner,

40:05.403 --> 40:08.740
a last grab
at some local specialties.

40:08.774 --> 40:12.243
"In the past, the town was
considered a sacred site

40:12.277 --> 40:16.247
"protected by St. Paul,
who, according to local belief,

40:16.281 --> 40:19.217
"made the land
and its inhabitants immune

40:19.250 --> 40:21.787
"to the bites
of poisonous animals,

40:21.820 --> 40:24.255
especially tarantula."

40:24.289 --> 40:26.324
That's why.
Here you go.

40:29.528 --> 40:33.098
A few final moments of happiness

40:33.131 --> 40:35.967
far from the madness.

40:36.001 --> 40:37.836
But it's going good now.

40:37.869 --> 40:39.270
I mean, look at it.
It's beautiful.

40:39.304 --> 40:41.940
The streets
are incredibly clean.

40:41.973 --> 40:43.675
I mean, I've never seen...

40:43.709 --> 40:45.633
Like, when you walk around
the streets, they shine.

40:45.644 --> 40:48.680
There's more money.
There's more tourism.

40:48.714 --> 40:51.416
But what is this hiding?

40:51.449 --> 40:54.152
Because for me,
when I see perfect beauty,

40:54.185 --> 40:56.988
I always wonder what's behind.
