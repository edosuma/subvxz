00:55.514 --> 00:57.307
Where's my hairbrush?

00:57.307 --> 00:59.768
In the bathroom, princess, where else?

00:59.768 --> 01:01.228
I looked, it's not there.

01:01.228 --> 01:03.146
Why don't you check again?

01:03.146 --> 01:04.313
What's up bug?

01:04.313 --> 01:05.691
Where's my hairbrush?

01:05.691 --> 01:06.608
I don't know.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.944
Do you want me to help you?
-I think the brush is hiding.

01:08.944 --> 01:10.362
Come, let's go.
-Where could it be?

01:11.405 --> 01:12.364
Listen, I need a favor.

01:12.364 --> 01:13.323
Yes?

01:13.323 --> 01:16.743
Did you hear anything about the
American woman that went missing?

01:16.743 --> 01:18.412
No. Here in Colombia?

01:18.954 --> 01:20.539
I'll tell you, wait.
Come here love, let's go.

01:23.375 --> 01:25.210
I already looked everywhere!

01:25.210 --> 01:26.545
Everywhere?

01:26.545 --> 01:27.671
Everywhere, Daddy.

01:27.671 --> 01:30.299
How about here?
You look here, and I'll look there.

01:30.299 --> 01:31.550
It's not there either.

01:31.550 --> 01:32.718
I looked already.

01:32.718 --> 01:34.219
Not there either?

01:34.219 --> 01:36.847
If I were a brush, where would I hide?

01:37.806 --> 01:38.724
Let's see.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.310
How about here? Look in that box.

01:41.310 --> 01:42.352
The hairbrush.

01:44.730 --> 01:47.274
Come here.
-Okay, let's see!

01:47.274 --> 01:48.901
You do it.

01:48.901 --> 01:50.194
Come here.

01:50.194 --> 01:51.278
My little queen.

01:52.154 --> 01:53.614
What's that sound?

01:53.614 --> 01:55.324
A little bird?

01:55.324 --> 01:56.283
The brush?

01:56.283 --> 01:57.201
There it is.

01:57.201 --> 01:58.327
The water?

02:04.958 --> 02:07.377
What are you doing?
-I'm putting it away.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.547
Come here.
I'll tell you about the American.

02:13.926 --> 02:15.177
Her name is Amber Chesborough.

02:15.177 --> 02:18.263
She was near San José del Guaviare
when she disappeared.

02:19.014 --> 02:20.557
Was it the rebels?

02:20.557 --> 02:21.517
Yes.

02:21.517 --> 02:22.809
What was she doing there?

02:23.727 --> 02:25.395
Traditional medicine.

02:25.395 --> 02:26.563
Researching.

02:27.523 --> 02:29.149
Her father-in-law just called me.

02:29.650 --> 02:32.444
He's a very big deal in the U.S.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.071
Of course I told him
I was at his disposal.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.992
So, what do you think?

02:41.078 --> 02:43.664
Amber's brother and husband
are flying here right now.

02:44.373 --> 02:46.333
Maybe through one of your sources

02:46.959 --> 02:49.586
we'd be able to get inside information.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.506
They're a good family.

02:52.506 --> 02:53.423
Good people.

04:15.339 --> 04:17.341
I'm calling to ask
if you have any information

04:17.341 --> 04:18.800
regarding a kidnapped American?

04:20.427 --> 04:21.762
<i>Amber Chesborough.</i>

04:38.278 --> 04:39.321
<i>Señora.</i>

04:39.905 --> 04:40.739
<i>Bueno.</i>

05:16.525 --> 05:17.609
Good morning.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.421
Thank you, Mr. Secretary.

05:37.421 --> 05:39.381
Honorable congressmen.

05:39.381 --> 05:43.802
My party has considered it pertinent
to put at your disposal

05:43.802 --> 05:46.847
for the consideration of this plenary

05:46.847 --> 05:49.016
a 90% investment

05:49.016 --> 05:50.851
for the good of the people.

06:05.908 --> 06:06.992
Excuse me, Senator.
-Yes?

06:06.992 --> 06:08.911
May I ask you something?
-Of course.

06:08.911 --> 06:11.205
It's about the kidnapping
of the American woman.

06:11.205 --> 06:14.208
I'd like to know if you think
it could be related to the FARC.

06:14.708 --> 06:15.584
Of course not.

06:15.584 --> 06:16.502
Not at all.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.171
Is this an official statement?

06:19.838 --> 06:22.591
If there has been a crime,
the criminals will obviously have to pay.

06:22.591 --> 06:23.759
But I know nothing about it.

06:23.759 --> 06:24.760
Okay, then...

06:25.302 --> 06:27.387
Who do you think may be involved?

06:27.387 --> 06:29.556
You said one question and
it's been three.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.433
Senator...
-No, I can't talk about it.

06:31.433 --> 06:33.185
Off the record, you know very well

06:33.185 --> 06:35.604
this could be a tragedy
for the peace agreement.

06:36.730 --> 06:37.856
You're not worried?

06:38.941 --> 06:41.443
Off the record,
they're a gang of criminals

06:41.443 --> 06:43.028
and pseudo-intellectuals.

06:43.612 --> 06:45.322
I know people
who have been talking to them.

06:45.989 --> 06:47.282
They're giving her back.

06:47.950 --> 06:49.284
Are you sure about that?

06:52.412 --> 06:53.622
Yes.

06:53.622 --> 06:55.082
Now, if I may...

06:55.082 --> 06:56.416
Ms. Matíz.
-Yes, of course.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.876
Good luck in the polls.

06:57.876 --> 06:58.794
Thank you.

07:45.883 --> 07:47.467
Where are we?

07:48.760 --> 07:50.470
Welcome lady.

07:53.056 --> 07:54.600
Go, up!
-Where are we?

07:55.475 --> 07:58.896
Relax. You're home, don't worry.

08:14.786 --> 08:15.621
Okay.

08:15.621 --> 08:18.457
We have men
on the street watching you, stay here.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.633
Excuse me, do you know
where I can find Enrique?

09:10.342 --> 09:11.969
No, ask there.

09:11.969 --> 09:12.886
Thank you.

09:18.183 --> 09:19.268
Hi.

09:19.268 --> 09:20.978
Are you Enrique?
-No.

09:20.978 --> 09:22.354
Do you know where he is?

09:29.361 --> 09:30.737
Enrique?

09:31.989 --> 09:33.657
Good morning.
-Good morning.

09:35.033 --> 09:36.660
It's a pleasure to meet you.

09:38.412 --> 09:39.413
I'm a big fan.

09:39.413 --> 09:40.372
Thank you.

09:40.372 --> 09:41.331
Have a seat.

09:51.383 --> 09:52.759
So where do we begin?

09:54.761 --> 09:56.680
Are you the spokesperson?

09:58.390 --> 09:59.224
Yes.

10:00.058 --> 10:01.518
Yes, you could call me that.

10:02.019 --> 10:03.854
We usually don't speak to the press.

10:05.480 --> 10:06.607
But, now's the time.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.194
What group do you belong to?

10:11.278 --> 10:13.655
I mean, you're part of the ELN, right?

10:13.655 --> 10:14.615
No.

10:14.615 --> 10:16.909
We're not part of any group.

10:18.202 --> 10:19.745
We're something new.

10:19.745 --> 10:20.954
We don't have a name.

10:21.580 --> 10:22.748
We don't have a brand.

10:23.373 --> 10:26.251
Perhaps you can be the one to name us.

10:29.171 --> 10:30.631
No, I don't think so.

10:30.631 --> 10:31.548
No?

10:31.548 --> 10:34.218
No, I'm not here to write
a story about you.

10:36.762 --> 10:38.514
But, it would be great.

10:38.514 --> 10:40.390
You're the best journalist in the country.

10:40.390 --> 10:42.476
Yes, but I won't give you publicity.

10:47.356 --> 10:49.399
I'm a bit confused.

10:50.067 --> 10:51.652
I thought this was
supposed to be an interview?

10:51.652 --> 10:53.487
No, this is not an interview.

10:54.738 --> 10:57.658
I'm here to ask you to
free the American woman.

10:58.283 --> 11:01.411
Once you do it, we can discuss
the possibility of an interview.

11:04.748 --> 11:05.791
I don't understand.

11:07.251 --> 11:10.254
You're telling me what to do?

11:11.296 --> 11:12.130
No.

11:13.215 --> 11:16.218
I'm here to give you some advice,
for your own safety.

11:21.390 --> 11:22.641
What the fuck?

11:22.641 --> 11:23.559
You're a journalist.

11:23.559 --> 11:26.770
You can't come in here, threaten me,
tell me what to do and...

11:26.770 --> 11:28.021
Let's see...

11:28.021 --> 11:30.732
imagine that at this very moment

11:30.732 --> 11:33.902
the military is deciding what actions
to take to solve this matter.

11:35.153 --> 11:38.407
And I'm the person
holding her hands out like this...

11:39.825 --> 11:41.577
In search of peace.

11:42.828 --> 11:44.580
But, what would happen if
I change my mind?

11:46.039 --> 11:48.709
And simply suggest for them
to be tougher on you.

11:49.334 --> 11:50.878
They could come here tonight.

11:50.878 --> 11:53.046
While you're sleeping.

12:04.349 --> 12:07.019
Why don't you go and fuck yourself?

12:11.773 --> 12:13.275
I'm very sorry.

12:15.027 --> 12:16.153
Excuse me.

12:57.444 --> 12:58.904
Fuck.

13:13.377 --> 13:18.966
I'm warm. I'm dry.
Nobody's shooting at me.

13:23.262 --> 13:29.059
I'm warm. I'm dry.
Nobody's shooting at me.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.326
Please, God.
Dear Heavenly Father, please--

13:48.537 --> 13:49.538
Okay.

13:54.334 --> 13:55.711
Bambi. Where are you, Bambi?

13:55.711 --> 13:57.588
Fucking listen to me.

14:14.188 --> 14:15.772
Welcome to Bogotá.

14:38.045 --> 14:40.214
Hi. US special operations.

14:41.590 --> 14:42.591
Morning.

14:58.232 --> 15:02.319
<i>It might take two days.
It might take a week.</i>

15:03.111 --> 15:04.863
You get the fuck outta here.

15:07.866 --> 15:09.618
I'm gonna get the fuck out of here.

15:33.517 --> 15:34.518
Come on.

15:36.228 --> 15:37.354
All right. Fuck this.

15:41.650 --> 15:42.734
Scuse me.

15:47.614 --> 15:48.615
Hey.

15:50.075 --> 15:52.286
Sorry for the wait, guys.
-Yeah.

15:52.286 --> 15:55.038
Amick Dunn. Embassy security.

15:55.038 --> 15:56.123
Hello.

15:56.665 --> 16:00.586
So, there is some positive news here.

16:00.586 --> 16:01.503
Okay.

16:01.503 --> 16:03.839
Kidnappers have asked for $250,000.

16:03.839 --> 16:04.882
So pay it.

16:06.592 --> 16:08.427
It's not that simple. We countered at 100.

16:08.427 --> 16:11.096
Or I'll pay it.
We'll back-channel it later.

16:12.055 --> 16:14.766
We'll meet in the middle.
And we'll wait a few days.

16:15.350 --> 16:16.977
See, if you offer them that amount, you...

16:16.977 --> 16:19.021
You're gonna wait a few days?
-...they'll move the goalposts.

16:19.021 --> 16:22.482
I sort of studied
the history of kidnapping in Colombia.

16:22.482 --> 16:23.775
Well, that's just great.

16:23.775 --> 16:25.277
I get where you're coming from.

16:25.986 --> 16:27.196
You don't, actually.

16:27.196 --> 16:30.574
Why don't you just
go get your chief of station, all right?

16:32.910 --> 16:33.952
Okay. Okay.

16:33.952 --> 16:35.078
All right.

16:57.392 --> 16:59.561
Hello. I'm Natalie Foster, COS.

16:59.561 --> 17:00.854
Alex Chesborough.

17:01.480 --> 17:02.814
Eric Haas.

17:02.814 --> 17:03.774
You want answers.

17:03.774 --> 17:06.401
Yes, ma'am. We just want to be read in.

17:07.819 --> 17:09.738
Okay. Well, why don't
you grab your things and follow me?

17:09.738 --> 17:11.406
Thank you. Thanks.
-Great.

17:12.324 --> 17:14.952
You've already
been filled in on the negotiations?

17:14.952 --> 17:16.036
Yes, we have.

17:16.787 --> 17:21.541
But, you know, he means
"read in" as if you trust us. Okay?

17:21.541 --> 17:24.795
As if we're on the same team.
As if we have security clearance.

17:24.795 --> 17:26.380
As if we do this for a living.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.633
Are you really treating this
as a fucking business deal?

17:29.633 --> 17:31.218
You know she's linked to the agency,
right?

17:31.218 --> 17:32.636
They're not aware of that.

17:32.636 --> 17:35.681
In Colombia, kidnappings
usually are business transactions.

17:35.681 --> 17:39.268
And I don't work for you,
so please watch your tone

17:39.268 --> 17:41.728
when you're in my embassy.
-Ma'am--

17:41.728 --> 17:45.983
Honestly, we're desperate for something.

17:47.359 --> 17:51.530
She's his wife. She's my sister. Please.

17:56.285 --> 17:59.746
You two look dehydrated from that flight,
and we're at 8,000 feet.

18:01.790 --> 18:03.834
Come on. Let's go get you some water.
It's downstairs.

18:19.183 --> 18:20.601
I'm going to trust you guys.

18:32.613 --> 18:33.780
Help yourselves.

18:35.282 --> 18:36.283
Thanks.

18:40.245 --> 18:41.997
Are we still in the same house?

18:41.997 --> 18:43.457
Yes, ma'am.

18:44.291 --> 18:48.212
How about we go again
with any new specificity and context?

18:48.212 --> 18:50.964
Sorry.
So, according to their cell phone data,

18:50.964 --> 18:54.843
she is still in that red house here.
In Ciudad Bolívar.

18:57.387 --> 19:02.059
<i>I can hear two male adults inside,
undetermined amount of kids</i>

19:02.059 --> 19:05.103
and just a lot of people
coming in and out.

19:09.525 --> 19:11.818
So as you can see, we have it all in hand.

19:12.736 --> 19:13.987
Is that Colombian SF?

19:14.947 --> 19:17.074
The colonel in charge, yes.
But we're not gonna need him.

19:17.074 --> 19:20.160
Negotiations are gonna work.
We'll have her back in a couple of days.

19:20.160 --> 19:21.703
Do you mind if I speak to him?

19:23.330 --> 19:24.498
Sure, you can try.

19:26.667 --> 19:28.085
Colonel Pereira.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.629
These are the husband and the brother.

19:31.463 --> 19:32.589
Good morning Colonel.

19:33.340 --> 19:35.425
I'm part of a JSOC military unit.

19:36.844 --> 19:37.719
Delta?

19:37.719 --> 19:38.804
Delta.

19:39.346 --> 19:40.514
If you have a moment

19:41.056 --> 19:43.100
we'd like to have a quick talk with you.

19:44.268 --> 19:47.062
Your perspective is very important to me.

19:48.730 --> 19:50.315
Permission to disclose?

19:50.315 --> 19:51.233
Yes.

19:52.025 --> 19:54.069
I have a call.
I'm gonna let you boys chat.

19:54.069 --> 19:55.153
Thank you.

19:56.613 --> 19:58.323
English or Spanish?

19:58.323 --> 20:00.409
English please, for my friend.

20:00.409 --> 20:01.577
Sure.
-Thank you.

20:04.872 --> 20:09.543
This neighborhood makes it
very, very hard to neutralize the tangos.

20:10.836 --> 20:12.337
<i>There are too many spotters.</i>

20:12.337 --> 20:16.550
<i>Local kids, gangs,
shooters on motorcycles.</i>

20:17.176 --> 20:20.888
<i>If one policeman goes in,
all the alarms go off.</i>

20:21.847 --> 20:24.808
I have also established three OPs.

20:25.392 --> 20:28.604
Here, here and here.
Making a triangle with the snipers.

20:28.604 --> 20:30.814
It's hard for me to get the green flag.

20:30.814 --> 20:35.986
Authorization must come from the embassy.
I'm stuck under a lot of approvals.

20:35.986 --> 20:37.821
And what about the exfil?

20:38.614 --> 20:42.868
Well, I'm sure you know
it's always the most dangerous part.

20:42.868 --> 20:45.204
<i>The moment we grab that package</i>

20:45.204 --> 20:48.332
<i>the neighborhood will start yelping
like a wounded animal.</i>

20:48.332 --> 20:50.000
<i>We'll be using 9mm ammunition</i>

20:50.000 --> 20:52.044
<i>to minimize civilian casualties.</i>

20:52.753 --> 20:54.922
If we go, my commanders will get her.

20:54.922 --> 20:56.507
<i>They're very experienced.</i>

20:57.508 --> 20:59.968
And now, what you can tell me about her?

20:59.968 --> 21:03.347
I don't know her training.
Can she handle a weapon?

21:04.640 --> 21:07.184
Will she be too scared to move?
Do we carry her?

21:09.937 --> 21:11.772
She'll be the best fighter you ever had.

21:25.327 --> 21:26.203
How are you?

21:27.204 --> 21:28.580
I'm great.

21:32.709 --> 21:34.086
Are you sure you're okay?

21:34.670 --> 21:36.380
Yes, I want a phone.

21:38.215 --> 21:39.550
A cell phone.

21:40.509 --> 21:41.510
No.

21:42.386 --> 21:43.971
For my family.

21:45.764 --> 21:46.765
I can't do that.

21:46.765 --> 21:47.891
Please!

21:49.726 --> 21:51.019
Money

21:51.687 --> 21:52.980
for just a moment

21:52.980 --> 21:54.231
to use your phone.

21:56.608 --> 21:57.442
No.

21:59.778 --> 22:00.779
Okay.

22:03.907 --> 22:04.783
What is this?

22:13.709 --> 22:17.171
It's my avalanche beacon.

22:17.963 --> 22:20.841
I don't know how to say it in Spanish.

22:22.384 --> 22:23.427
How do you say it?

22:23.427 --> 22:24.511
Snow?

22:25.345 --> 22:26.513
Snow!

22:27.014 --> 22:28.056
For skiing.

22:29.474 --> 22:32.269
Ski. I'm a skier. So...

22:33.020 --> 22:34.730
You're skiing Colombia?

22:36.148 --> 22:37.149
No.

22:39.526 --> 22:40.861
Not in Colombia.

22:48.702 --> 22:49.578
Thank you.

22:49.578 --> 22:50.913
You're welcome.

22:55.584 --> 22:57.252
I ski in Colorado!

23:22.736 --> 23:29.743
Resistance!

23:30.410 --> 23:31.954
Hey, I need to talk to Graciela.

23:31.954 --> 23:33.288
Why?

23:33.288 --> 23:34.665
I can't tell you.

23:36.875 --> 23:42.005
Resistance!

23:45.676 --> 23:47.511
Long live the national strike!

23:49.930 --> 23:51.849
Long live the national strike!

23:59.314 --> 24:00.274
All good?

24:00.274 --> 24:01.316
It's the American woman.

24:02.109 --> 24:03.026
She's fine.

24:03.610 --> 24:07.114
The thing is, the guys in the jungle
found something in her backpack.

24:07.781 --> 24:09.157
An electronic device.

24:12.327 --> 24:13.787
Shit.

24:13.787 --> 24:14.955
It looks military.

24:14.955 --> 24:16.331
That's what I thought.

24:17.416 --> 24:18.292
Now what?

24:20.127 --> 24:21.128
Will you talk to her?

24:25.299 --> 24:27.050
It's risky for me to talk to her.

24:28.051 --> 24:29.845
So I need to be in charge.

24:31.680 --> 24:32.890
Give it here.

24:38.061 --> 24:40.022
<i>I asked my wife, Violeta, to get involved.</i>

24:40.022 --> 24:42.649
She's a journalist and very influential.

24:42.649 --> 24:45.027
I spoke with someone this morning.

24:45.027 --> 24:49.031
He is a kind of s--
publicist for this organization.

24:49.031 --> 24:50.657
He seems very unexperienced.

24:50.657 --> 24:53.744
I'm very scared about all the situation
that they make.

24:53.744 --> 25:00.000
At the same time, I met with the senator.
He was FARC, so he knows a lot, of course.

25:00.000 --> 25:03.587
And he believes
that she will be returned safely.

25:03.587 --> 25:05.672
What the CIA say?

25:05.672 --> 25:09.092
Well, it's a business transaction.

25:10.010 --> 25:13.764
It seems
everybody is in the same reality, right?

25:16.391 --> 25:19.353
Darling, you didn't mention
that this was a new group.

25:20.854 --> 25:22.314
Yeah, that's true.

25:22.314 --> 25:26.193
It's a new version of...<i>M-19</i>.
-M-19.

25:26.193 --> 25:28.654
But it's all the same shit.

25:28.654 --> 25:31.073
They all start political, end up criminal.

25:31.949 --> 25:34.993
But this moment where this group is at
is the most dangerous.

25:35.494 --> 25:36.787
Really? Why?

25:36.787 --> 25:39.081
Well, because they're young,
they can be unrealistic.

25:39.081 --> 25:41.333
It's like playing poker with a rookie

25:41.917 --> 25:44.211
that still doesn't understand
the rules of the game.

25:45.379 --> 25:46.922
They make crazy bets.

25:56.014 --> 25:59.017
Long time ago, Violeta and her sister
were kidnapped by guerrillas.

25:59.601 --> 26:00.978
It was a lot more common back then.

26:01.562 --> 26:04.481
They called it "<i>pesca milagrosa,</i>"
"miracle fishing."

26:04.982 --> 26:08.527
We had a lot of conversation with the
police and there was a lot of planning.

26:08.527 --> 26:12.823
Things kept changing,
and, eventually, we did it ourselves.

26:13.532 --> 26:18.287
Yeah.
She was killed there in the cross fire.

26:19.872 --> 26:20.873
Very sorry.

26:24.585 --> 26:26.420
I have a meeting now,
and I know you have one too.

26:26.420 --> 26:28.213
But let's keep talking about this.
-Yeah.

26:28.213 --> 26:31.049
How about you guys come
for dinner tonight, all right?

26:31.049 --> 26:32.634
You should be with friends right now.

26:53.572 --> 26:55.199
Here comes your new girl boss!

26:57.367 --> 26:58.368
Oops.

27:02.623 --> 27:03.957
Welcome to your ranch.

27:09.213 --> 27:10.923
Looks like the party was fun.

27:14.092 --> 27:15.511
Hey, Chino.

27:17.179 --> 27:18.180
Chino.

27:18.972 --> 27:19.973
Go get the American.

27:24.144 --> 27:25.729
Dude. A chair, please.

27:53.757 --> 27:54.967
<i>Gracias</i>.

28:55.277 --> 28:56.570
<i>Hola</i>.

28:56.570 --> 28:58.280
You are so pretty.

28:58.864 --> 29:00.782
Thank you. Hi.

29:02.701 --> 29:04.536
We're taking over, okay?

29:05.829 --> 29:06.830
Cool.

29:08.498 --> 29:09.499
Who are you guys?

29:13.921 --> 29:14.963
2.0.

29:14.963 --> 29:16.089
What's that?

29:16.590 --> 29:18.467
Political stuff. Don't worry about it.

29:18.467 --> 29:22.262
Okay. Cool. Yeah. No, I totally get that.

29:22.262 --> 29:24.890
Taking up arms
against an oppressive system.

29:24.890 --> 29:28.602
I would totally
do the same thing if I was in your shoes.

29:29.436 --> 29:30.479
Nah, I don't think so.

29:30.479 --> 29:33.440
Yeah. I would, actually.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.025
You'd go to a protest.

29:36.235 --> 29:37.986
Right, that's what we do in America.

29:37.986 --> 29:40.447
This is also America, you know?
-South, but--

29:40.447 --> 29:44.618
No, I'm just saying
that if my country was in a civil war,

29:44.618 --> 29:46.870
I think I would join too. That's all.

29:47.996 --> 29:51.166
So you're saying that
you came down here for the trees, right?

29:51.166 --> 29:54.461
Yeah, I'm a research scientist.

29:54.461 --> 29:57.214
I specialize in bioactive plants.

29:58.006 --> 30:01.051
And there are specific compounds
that are unique to this region

30:01.051 --> 30:05.138
that I find promising
for my addiction research.

30:05.138 --> 30:06.390
Nice.
-Yeah.

30:06.390 --> 30:07.474
Cool.

30:08.642 --> 30:09.643
Yeah.

30:15.816 --> 30:22.072
I know you probably need money,
so I could get you $2,000.

30:23.574 --> 30:26.660
You know, that's a lot of money
for a poor Colombian, right?

30:28.537 --> 30:29.621
It's what I have.

30:29.621 --> 30:34.418
But wait,
what will we do with $2,000? Thank you.

30:36.211 --> 30:38.297
What will we do with $2,000?

30:39.214 --> 30:40.757
I don't know. What will we do?

30:43.343 --> 30:45.304
I don't know.

30:46.138 --> 30:48.599
A lot of rice for your village.

30:54.021 --> 30:55.355
Chinese rice.

30:55.939 --> 30:58.317
This is really fucked up, guys.

30:59.651 --> 31:02.362
Just, if you give me a cell,
I'll get you money.

31:02.362 --> 31:03.614
I'll get you a lot of money.

31:03.614 --> 31:05.824
Okay, I'm gonna tell you two things
right now.

31:05.824 --> 31:07.784
And I want you to remember, okay?

31:07.784 --> 31:08.869
Okay.

31:08.869 --> 31:10.495
This is not a village.

31:10.495 --> 31:12.456
This is a fucking country
and a beautiful one.

31:13.916 --> 31:18.378
And I don't want your money.
And we don't need your money, right?

31:20.172 --> 31:22.549
Got it?
-Got it.

31:24.134 --> 31:28.889
We know who your husband is.
We are negotiating for your release.

31:29.473 --> 31:32.351
Okay.
-But it's kind of a problem.

31:32.976 --> 31:36.230
Why?
-'Cause we have doubts about you.

31:36.855 --> 31:39.066
Maybe you're DEA or CIA?

31:39.566 --> 31:44.321
Why would I be DEA or CIA?
This isn't <i>Jason Bourne</i>.

31:44.905 --> 31:46.365
Such a great film, you know?

31:46.365 --> 31:48.742
But no, isn't, actually.

31:50.869 --> 31:54.665
The technology in your bag. Tell us.

31:55.999 --> 31:57.084
Yeah, okay.

31:58.168 --> 32:01.004
My husband put it in there
for when I go skiing,

32:01.588 --> 32:03.340
in case there's an avalanche.

32:03.841 --> 32:05.175
It was hiding in there.

32:06.760 --> 32:09.096
Got it. Okay, now I understand you.

32:09.680 --> 32:12.808
So my husband can be a bit of a dick,

32:12.808 --> 32:14.518
and he put it in there.

32:14.518 --> 32:17.896
I research it online, <i>mi amor</i>.

32:19.898 --> 32:21.024
It's military.

32:21.525 --> 32:24.444
Yes. Good. Yes.

32:24.945 --> 32:29.074
His father sells military weapons
to our government.

32:29.741 --> 32:31.118
Okay?
-Yeah.

32:31.118 --> 32:34.204
And honestly,
I didn't know it was in there.

32:34.204 --> 32:37.791
He put it in my bag.
I didn't even want it.

32:37.791 --> 32:40.002
Why?
-Because I don't like to be followed.

32:40.002 --> 32:42.546
So I said,
"No, no. I don't wanna take that."

32:42.546 --> 32:45.799
You did, though.
-No. Goddamn it! No!

32:45.799 --> 32:49.511
I'm telling you that he put it in my bag.
Do you understand that?

32:49.511 --> 32:51.013
He put it in my bag.

32:51.972 --> 32:53.515
Who the fuck are you really?

32:54.641 --> 32:58.395
Are you CIA targeter?
Are you building a deck?

32:58.395 --> 32:59.938
Are we your target?
-Am I?

32:59.938 --> 33:03.817
I just met you guys.
I don't know who the fuck you are.

33:03.817 --> 33:07.321
Am-- And I'm a what? What did you say?
-Targeter.

33:07.321 --> 33:09.990
You don't know that word. Really?

33:11.325 --> 33:12.284
Come on.

33:20.250 --> 33:21.251
Hello.

33:21.251 --> 33:23.212
<i>So we're being overtaken by events.</i>

33:23.212 --> 33:25.005
<i>I need you to brace yourself.</i>
-Okay.

33:25.005 --> 33:27.925
<i>These are bad people, okay,
but they're not totally stupid.</i>

33:27.925 --> 33:29.676
They found Amber's military beacon,

33:29.676 --> 33:32.262
and they've changed their assessment
of who she is.

33:33.013 --> 33:34.139
Now that she's valuable,

33:35.098 --> 33:36.975
<i>negotiations are off.</i>

33:37.726 --> 33:40.687
<i>They could hold her for 20 years
or they could kill her tomorrow.</i>

33:41.688 --> 33:44.650
<i>We're spinning up the rescue mission.
It's on the director's desk.</i>

33:44.650 --> 33:46.026
Understood. Thank you.

33:52.199 --> 33:53.200
That was Foster.

33:53.200 --> 33:55.744
Everything's changed
in the kidnappers' mindset.

33:55.744 --> 33:57.663
That beacon you put in her bag,

33:59.498 --> 34:03.126
they found it,
and they've determined that it's military.

34:05.712 --> 34:07.840
And now they assume that she's high value.

34:10.342 --> 34:11.426
Negotiations are off.

34:13.719 --> 34:14.554
Fuck.

34:14.554 --> 34:18.684
Direct actions,
two weeks of planning minimum.

34:19.184 --> 34:20.686
Especially in that neighborhood.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.022
I fucked her.

34:25.524 --> 34:26.525
Pretty much.

34:27.192 --> 34:31.737
I'm so sorry, man. I feel like a monster.

34:31.737 --> 34:34.574
Yeah, I don't give a shit
how you feel, man.

34:41.831 --> 34:43.292
I was so fucking arrogant.

34:48.839 --> 34:50.882
I thought that beacon would keep her safe.

35:00.684 --> 35:01.977
I can't let her die.

35:04.062 --> 35:05.480
I'm not gonna let her die.

35:08.692 --> 35:10.027
I can't let her die.

35:28.462 --> 35:30.005
Let's talk about strategy, okay?

35:32.174 --> 35:33.175
Roger.

35:35.260 --> 35:38.263
They're not gonna let her go.
The agency will cut ties.

35:39.139 --> 35:40.724
I don't know.
-Well--

35:40.724 --> 35:43.018
Foster seems sincere
about the strike plan.

35:43.018 --> 35:44.561
You want me to red-team that?

35:44.561 --> 35:46.313
Yeah, be my guest.

35:47.147 --> 35:48.690
Hey, truly no offense, but you--

35:48.690 --> 35:52.236
Part of you is still a kid from the sticks
happy to be in the room with a three-star.

35:52.236 --> 35:56.949
When I was a kid, we had CIA directors
at our dinner table begging us for crumbs.

35:57.991 --> 35:58.909
And?

35:58.909 --> 36:01.036
I know how these decisions are made.

36:02.162 --> 36:04.373
They're not gonna say,
but they won't approve a raid.

36:07.167 --> 36:10.254
We need to get in there,
hit that house now.

38:27.808 --> 38:29.476
I guess we should cancel dinner.

38:39.236 --> 38:40.362
Here we go.

38:41.530 --> 38:42.531
That's it.

38:43.282 --> 38:46.952
That's it.
She could be just down there, man.

38:49.288 --> 38:52.583
Right under that fucking cover.
-Uh-huh.

39:09.975 --> 39:11.226
I'll take that.

39:12.769 --> 39:14.354
Right. Here you go.

39:35.209 --> 39:36.627
<i>Wolf 6, this is Ray 2.</i>

39:37.628 --> 39:39.505
I have the target on sight.

39:40.255 --> 39:42.216
<i>They're the gringos
who were at the office.</i>

39:42.216 --> 39:45.886
<i>They're tall, wearing reflective jackets
and baseball caps.</i>

39:46.386 --> 39:47.804
Nobody shoots.

39:47.804 --> 39:49.598
Understood? Freeze.

39:50.516 --> 39:51.934
<i>They're Purples, not Tangos.</i>

39:51.934 --> 39:53.101
<i>Nobody shoots, I repeat.</i>

39:54.561 --> 39:55.646
<i>Anybody got eyes on the package?</i>

39:56.230 --> 39:57.564
<i>That's a negative, sir.</i>

40:58.333 --> 41:01.086
I gotta show you something.
There's a tunnel on the first floor.

41:01.086 --> 41:02.171
It goes to the next house.

41:02.171 --> 41:04.381
Dude, she's been sleeping up here.

41:09.970 --> 41:11.346
No.

41:12.598 --> 41:14.683
Go back down the stairs.

41:14.683 --> 41:16.685
Out, out!

41:24.109 --> 41:25.694
They got in!

41:40.167 --> 41:42.544
<i>Two Purples are trapped on the roof.</i>

41:44.505 --> 41:46.423
<i>Get the drone in the air.</i>

41:51.220 --> 41:52.930
Drone image on this screen, sir.

42:06.902 --> 42:09.154
<i>Which direction are the Purples moving?</i>

42:09.154 --> 42:11.114
<i>Sierra Whiskey sir, Sierra Whiskey.</i>

42:30.717 --> 42:32.970
<i>Hot terrace. They're making contact, sir.</i>

42:33.846 --> 42:35.973
<i>You're cleared to fire
against all threats!</i>

42:36.765 --> 42:37.891
<i>Protect the Purples!</i>

42:42.563 --> 42:44.523
<i>I'm losing sight of them, sir.</i>

42:45.190 --> 42:46.066
Wolf 6 to snipers.

42:46.066 --> 42:47.192
Does anyone see them?

42:47.192 --> 42:48.569
<i>That's a negative, sir.</i>

42:49.820 --> 42:51.363
<i>Does anyone have eyes on them?</i>

42:53.782 --> 42:54.616
Negative.

44:25.582 --> 44:26.875
<i>Buenas noches.</i>

44:41.974 --> 44:42.933
<i>Wolf 6.</i>

44:42.933 --> 44:44.184
<i>I have them on sight.</i>

44:56.613 --> 44:58.365
<i>All units from Sierra Whiskey,</i>

44:58.365 --> 45:00.242
<i>moving towards Sierra Whiskey on a chase.</i>

45:03.370 --> 45:05.122
Sir, we have a motorcycle approaching.

45:05.122 --> 45:06.748
Authorized to fire on Tangos.

45:07.499 --> 45:08.709
Fire at will, sir.

45:42.284 --> 45:43.452
Wait, wait, wait.

45:47.831 --> 45:49.124
Come on.

45:51.710 --> 45:53.003
Just go, man.

46:01.803 --> 46:03.847
<i>High value target has been shot
by the Purples.</i>

46:03.847 --> 46:05.641
<i>Repeat, high value target.</i>

46:05.641 --> 46:07.518
<i>Tango 2 has been shot by the Purples.</i>

46:07.518 --> 46:09.853
<i>They're running away through
the streets and terraces, sir.</i>

47:19.548 --> 47:21.216
We got our next move.
