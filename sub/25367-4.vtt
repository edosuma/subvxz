"The Affair"...

00:06.040 --> 00:07.703
- Do I know you?
- Think you decked me

00:07.790 --> 00:09.372
- with your board this morning.
- Yeah.

00:09.459 --> 00:11.017
Yo, let me
make it up to you.

00:18.937 --> 00:21.117
I just watched you
freebasing, asshole.

00:21.204 --> 00:23.041
Why don't you give
the police a call, huh?

00:23.128 --> 00:25.375
Love to tell them who sold me
my first eight-ball,

00:25.462 --> 00:26.875
Mr. Lockhart.

00:26.962 --> 00:29.958
Cole, she abandoned
her daughter on our doorstep.

00:30.045 --> 00:32.046
- She is still Joanie's mother.
- She doesn't

00:32.134 --> 00:33.500
- deserve to be.
- Well, what do you want me to do?

00:33.587 --> 00:34.763
Let's give her
what she wants

00:34.850 --> 00:36.375
so we can stop
thinking about her.

00:36.462 --> 00:37.867
I'm not a fan of Alison.

00:37.954 --> 00:39.806
She should have
her daughter back.

00:39.893 --> 00:41.244
We did the right thing.

00:42.369 --> 00:43.743
Oh, shit.

00:45.034 --> 00:46.129
Hi, Officer.

00:47.473 --> 00:48.883
I hate that a fucking cop

00:48.970 --> 00:51.001
can pull me over,
and my only hope

00:51.088 --> 00:52.281
is that you know him

00:52.368 --> 00:54.214
and he likes you
so he won't fuck with me.

00:54.301 --> 00:56.509
Maybe we can try again
to get you a green card.

00:56.596 --> 00:57.547
How?

00:57.634 --> 00:59.489
I have no children
of my own.

00:59.620 --> 01:01.221
I can't demonstrate hardship.

01:01.308 --> 01:02.791
Guess where
I was this morning.

01:02.878 --> 01:04.791
- I got no idea, Ali.
- I was at Woodlawn.

01:04.878 --> 01:06.651
Someone like me,
with my experience,

01:06.738 --> 01:08.762
I could turn this into a career.

01:09.292 --> 01:10.744
- A career?
- I'm just trying

01:10.831 --> 01:11.961
to move on with my life.

01:12.048 --> 01:14.351
I would hardly call
what you're doing moving on.

01:14.438 --> 01:15.875
- Why not?
- You have practically

01:15.962 --> 01:18.190
made his death
your entire identity.

01:18.277 --> 01:20.063
That conference
I was telling you about,

01:20.150 --> 01:21.715
it's happening in Montauk.

01:22.751 --> 01:24.984
Is, uh... is this
the grant coordinator's office?

01:25.071 --> 01:27.903
- Hi. I'm Alison.
- Ben.

01:28.126 --> 01:30.672
How long do you have left
with your program?

01:30.759 --> 01:32.555
Five months, two weeks
and three days.

01:32.642 --> 01:33.926

02:51.108 --> 02:52.536
What are you implying?

02:52.747 --> 02:54.305
I'm not
implying anything, Cole.

02:54.392 --> 02:55.493
I'm asking.

02:55.580 --> 02:58.122
Look, Alison has a history
of depression, so...

02:58.350 --> 03:00.047
how has she seemed
to you lately?

03:00.134 --> 03:01.472
How has she been feeling?

03:01.559 --> 03:03.208
How's she been feeling?

03:03.744 --> 03:04.926
She's been happy.

03:05.120 --> 03:06.680
She's been fine... for years now.

03:06.767 --> 03:08.760
And she wouldn't do
something like that to Joanie.

03:08.847 --> 03:09.888
Just relax, Cole.

03:09.975 --> 03:11.325
Jeffries is
trying to help.

03:11.412 --> 03:12.960
Wait. Is that Solloway?

03:13.074 --> 03:14.124
Hi, Detective.

03:14.211 --> 03:15.698
We appreciate
all you're doing.

03:15.785 --> 03:16.913
No, we don't.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.095
He's not concentrated
on the right things.

03:19.647 --> 03:21.386
What about the guy
she's been seeing?

03:21.473 --> 03:23.346
Uh, Benjamin Cruz.

03:23.433 --> 03:25.711
- Does he have an alibi?
- An alibi for what?

03:25.798 --> 03:28.266
Look, this isn't a crime
investigation, Cole.

03:28.353 --> 03:31.184
Alison is missing,
so we're focusing on her.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.412
Just give me a call
if you remember something.

03:33.499 --> 03:34.870
Things she was concerned about.

03:34.957 --> 03:36.985
Any irrational behavior.

03:37.072 --> 03:38.491
- Maybe even...
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

03:38.578 --> 03:40.377
I told you she's been fine!

03:40.464 --> 03:41.432
Anton.

03:41.519 --> 03:43.497
Let's pull off up here.

03:43.995 --> 03:45.229
Let's get something to eat.

03:45.316 --> 03:46.308
Sure.

03:59.941 --> 04:01.607
Oh, fuck.

04:04.403 --> 04:05.675
You want to get that?

04:05.762 --> 04:07.232
I'll grab you something.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.040
Thank you.

04:14.113 --> 04:16.250
Hey, Luisa.
How are you?

04:19.144 --> 04:20.510
Secretary of state?

04:20.596 --> 04:21.696
Why not the president?

04:21.783 --> 04:23.169
Too much work.

04:24.808 --> 04:26.369
Well, we have to go now.

04:26.456 --> 04:27.791
I have to brush
someone's teeth.

04:27.878 --> 04:29.573
- I can do it myself.
- Yeah.

04:29.660 --> 04:31.174
Bye, Noah. See you later.

04:31.261 --> 04:33.635
Bye, Joanie.
Thanks for talking to me.

04:33.722 --> 04:35.633
Okay, brush 'em all,
even the back ones.

04:35.720 --> 04:36.707
I'm gonna check.

04:36.794 --> 04:38.050
I will.

04:41.620 --> 04:42.754
So...

04:43.128 --> 04:44.197
So.

04:44.503 --> 04:47.584
Uh, I should probably
get going myself.

04:48.081 --> 04:49.364
Yeah.

04:49.894 --> 04:51.223
You look good.

04:52.206 --> 04:53.511
Thank you.

04:54.019 --> 04:55.356
Are you good?

04:55.558 --> 04:57.458
Yeah, I think so.

04:57.589 --> 04:58.628
You?

04:58.964 --> 05:00.334
Yeah, I'm fine.

05:00.729 --> 05:03.838
Helen's kind of making it
a Herculean task

05:03.925 --> 05:05.292
to see the kids, but...

05:05.503 --> 05:07.096
Well, isn't that
why you're out there?

05:07.183 --> 05:08.947
Sure is, but you know Helen.

05:09.034 --> 05:10.080
Why make things simple

05:10.167 --> 05:12.505
when they can be
painful and difficult?

05:13.331 --> 05:15.981
Yeah, well, you're doing
the right thing.

05:16.276 --> 05:18.455
Your kids will know
that you fought to see them.

05:18.542 --> 05:20.950
And it will mean something
to them one day.

05:21.691 --> 05:22.803
Hope so.

05:22.890 --> 05:25.989
Believe me,
my dad didn't, so I know.

05:27.284 --> 05:28.973
Hey, I sent you something.

05:29.831 --> 05:31.231
Oh, God, what?

05:31.347 --> 05:33.292
Nothing. It's just a gift card.

05:33.589 --> 05:35.614
What kind of gift card?

05:36.003 --> 05:38.276
To buy a plane ticket
to California

05:38.363 --> 05:39.538
for you and Joanie,

05:39.625 --> 05:41.872
in case you ever
need to get away.

05:44.120 --> 05:46.584
I'd like to see her again,
Alison, in person.

05:46.949 --> 05:50.283
'Cause, you know,
I did raise that child

05:50.370 --> 05:52.909
as my own daughter for the
first two years of her life.

05:52.996 --> 05:54.013
I know.

05:54.081 --> 05:56.417
Because, you know,
I thought she was my daughter.

05:56.504 --> 05:57.894
Yes.

05:58.433 --> 06:01.473
Just keep it for a rainy day.

06:04.589 --> 06:05.728
Okay.

06:05.815 --> 06:06.980
I will.

06:07.278 --> 06:08.986
Thank you.

06:10.105 --> 06:11.762
Good luck out there.

06:11.988 --> 06:13.239
You, too.

06:13.488 --> 06:14.947
Okay.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.942
Here you go. Enjoy.

06:31.589 --> 06:32.634
Hi.

06:32.730 --> 06:35.590
- Hi. May I help you?
- Um, Bailey, Alison.

06:35.677 --> 06:37.755
Let's see. Yes.

06:38.074 --> 06:39.919
Uh-huh, there you go.

06:40.697 --> 06:42.872
- There you are.
- Ah. Thank you.

06:43.842 --> 06:45.128
Enjoy the conference.

06:45.215 --> 06:46.324
Thanks.

07:22.575 --> 07:23.953
Close your eyes.

07:26.209 --> 07:27.695
Take a breath.

07:33.101 --> 07:34.985
What do you notice?

07:40.824 --> 07:42.787
The kitchen sink is...

07:43.309 --> 07:45.375
full of dirty dishes.

07:47.614 --> 07:49.459
Okay. Good.

07:49.597 --> 07:51.021
Go with that.

08:00.230 --> 08:02.076
Close your eyes.

08:02.845 --> 08:04.398
Take a breath.

08:08.533 --> 08:10.287
What do you notice?

08:15.206 --> 08:18.162
My mother is standing
in the doorway.

08:19.567 --> 08:21.051
She's...

08:21.301 --> 08:22.998
holding a letter.

08:24.715 --> 08:25.738
Okay, good.

08:25.825 --> 08:27.185
Let's go with that.

08:27.723 --> 08:30.909
Another option if the patient
is stuck is to, um...

08:31.191 --> 08:34.466
to press on their hands,
on the palms like this.

08:36.946 --> 08:38.392
Okay.

08:43.703 --> 08:45.141
Take a breath.

08:45.228 --> 08:46.823
Close your eyes.

08:49.602 --> 08:51.292
What do you notice?

08:55.946 --> 08:58.018
She's crying.

08:58.876 --> 09:00.971
She's apologizing.

09:05.263 --> 09:07.878
She's saying
that she knew all along.

09:11.116 --> 09:12.698
That's good.

09:14.884 --> 09:16.813
Okay. Thank you
so much, Tria.

09:16.900 --> 09:18.846
We're gonna
stop here, okay?

09:19.650 --> 09:22.469
When we started this session,
you said that your, um,

09:22.556 --> 09:24.651
distress and discomfort,

09:25.080 --> 09:27.610
having to keep
your sister's secret down

09:27.697 --> 09:29.208
for all those years...

09:29.611 --> 09:31.115
said it was about
a nine or a ten.

09:31.202 --> 09:32.581
Is that correct?

09:33.626 --> 09:35.345
- When I thought of it, yes.
- Right.

09:35.432 --> 09:37.115
You said you-you
didn't let yourself

09:37.202 --> 09:39.307
think about it
often, right?

09:39.798 --> 09:41.862
Because of how painful
it was for you?

09:42.626 --> 09:45.510
Would you do me a favor and
imagine that scene again now?

09:50.874 --> 09:51.905
And?

09:52.015 --> 09:55.417
What's the level
of your current discomfort?

10:00.335 --> 10:03.102
Maybe a... a two.

10:07.945 --> 10:09.805
It feels further away.

10:11.290 --> 10:13.641
Like it's happening
to someone else.

10:18.437 --> 10:19.837
Okay.

10:20.022 --> 10:22.389
So, the idea behind

10:22.476 --> 10:26.545
eye movement desensitization
and reprocessing... EMDR...

10:26.632 --> 10:29.053
Is to, um, reorganize
our memories

10:29.140 --> 10:32.684
such that they feel more neutral
and less, uh... less charged.

10:32.771 --> 10:33.801
Yeah?

10:33.888 --> 10:35.555
Why does it work?

10:36.617 --> 10:38.358
Nobody knows for sure,
to be honest.

10:38.445 --> 10:41.068
But we hypothesize
that its effectiveness

10:41.155 --> 10:43.233
has something to do
with imitating

10:43.320 --> 10:45.305
what happens
in the brain during REM.

10:45.437 --> 10:47.738
Basically, we believe
that mental healing

10:47.825 --> 10:49.139
is a lot like
physical healing.

10:49.226 --> 10:51.038
Our body wants
to repair itself.

10:51.125 --> 10:54.506
But if a foreign object
or-or a... a repeated injury

10:54.593 --> 10:59.055
irritates a physical wound,
it's not going to heal.

10:59.257 --> 11:01.906
Our mind heals
from psychological trauma

11:01.993 --> 11:03.475
in very much
the same way.

11:03.562 --> 11:04.913
If the system
is blocked

11:05.000 --> 11:07.016
by a disturbing memory,

11:07.648 --> 11:09.782
the emotional wound
is going to fester,

11:09.913 --> 11:12.477
and it causes an intense
amount of suffering.

11:12.609 --> 11:13.907
So, what EMDR does,
basically,

11:13.994 --> 11:15.958
it's-it's, um...
it diffuses that block.

11:16.045 --> 11:17.062
It, uh,

11:17.130 --> 11:19.345
neutralizes its potency

11:19.586 --> 11:22.334
so that we can basically
heal our own minds.

11:24.187 --> 11:25.602
Yep, you in the back?

11:25.758 --> 11:27.497
Can you, uh,
talk specifically

11:27.584 --> 11:28.614
about your experiences

11:28.701 --> 11:30.380
doing this kind of work
with veterans?

11:30.531 --> 11:32.033
Excellent question.

11:32.202 --> 11:35.335
You know, in three separate
clinical trials last year alone,

11:35.422 --> 11:39.290
it was recently reported
that after 12 EMDR sessions

11:39.377 --> 11:42.155
77.7% of
combat veterans

11:42.242 --> 11:44.681
no longer met
the criteria for PTSD.

11:45.563 --> 11:47.624
All right, we're about
to take a break.

11:47.711 --> 11:50.405
Uh, find a partner.
Spread around.

11:50.492 --> 11:52.848
I want you to experience
this technique for yourselves.

11:52.935 --> 11:54.725
Take an hour
and, uh, come back here

11:54.812 --> 11:55.915
to discuss
your discoveries.

11:55.983 --> 11:57.212
Thank you, guys.

12:31.589 --> 12:33.759
It's pretty
interesting stuff, huh?

12:35.410 --> 12:36.569
You scared me.

12:36.656 --> 12:39.036
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm not that terrifying.

12:39.123 --> 12:40.716
Do you forgive me?

12:41.120 --> 12:42.692
What are you doing here?

12:43.343 --> 12:45.105
Stalking you, of course.

12:46.777 --> 12:48.364
I'm kidding.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.901
Um, the VHA, they sent me here
to investigate this therapy.

12:51.988 --> 12:54.255
We think it could be
helpful for our guys.

12:54.495 --> 12:55.697
Oh.

12:56.097 --> 12:57.823
You want to try it out?

12:57.910 --> 12:59.192
Partner up?

12:59.800 --> 13:01.572
Um, yeah.

13:01.874 --> 13:02.925
Okay.

13:03.230 --> 13:04.269
Cool.

13:04.356 --> 13:05.398
Okay.

13:05.485 --> 13:06.964
Oh, sorry.

13:23.845 --> 13:24.861
Okay.

13:37.009 --> 13:38.956
- All right, um...
- Okay.

13:41.733 --> 13:43.687
Let's see. Uh...

13:46.587 --> 13:48.876
It says, uh,
we can start with...

13:49.103 --> 13:51.667
taking an oral history
of each other.

13:52.751 --> 13:54.503
That sounds a little
dirty, doesn't it?

13:55.240 --> 13:56.471
Then, uh,

13:56.558 --> 13:58.211
we move on to the

13:58.298 --> 14:00.698
question and finger
metronome thing.

14:02.064 --> 14:03.117
Are you, uh...

14:03.204 --> 14:04.586
Are you nervous?
You seem nervous.

14:04.673 --> 14:06.672
- No, no, I'm... No.
- I'm nervous.

14:06.759 --> 14:07.781
Okay.

14:07.986 --> 14:09.870
I'm a little nervous.

14:10.736 --> 14:14.089
Never done anything
like this before, so...

14:14.176 --> 14:15.956
Yeah. Me, neither.

14:16.533 --> 14:18.776
Glad my first time
will be with you, though.

14:26.579 --> 14:27.787
So...

14:28.012 --> 14:29.674
what are your traumas?

14:32.181 --> 14:33.650
Um...

14:35.775 --> 14:38.292
Well, my dad left my mom,

14:38.504 --> 14:40.971
but that was before
I was born, so...

14:41.853 --> 14:43.690
Okay. Um...

14:44.111 --> 14:45.917
You said you were
twice divorced?

14:46.062 --> 14:47.643
Any trauma there?

14:49.779 --> 14:50.820
What?

14:51.009 --> 14:52.813
Okay, all right.

14:53.197 --> 14:54.940
Well, what does that
leave us with?

14:55.027 --> 14:57.034
Um, any phobias?

14:57.629 --> 14:59.471
Well, um...

15:00.344 --> 15:02.073
I don't love the ocean.

15:02.986 --> 15:03.992
Classic.

15:04.079 --> 15:05.277
Okay. Water.

15:05.364 --> 15:07.784
Um, let's start with that.

15:07.871 --> 15:08.941
You ready?

15:09.028 --> 15:10.342
Mm-hmm.

15:22.430 --> 15:24.166
Close your eyes.

15:25.548 --> 15:27.206
Think of the ocean.

15:28.346 --> 15:29.783
Okay.

15:34.272 --> 15:35.589
Hold, please.

15:35.988 --> 15:37.111
You're a natural.

15:37.179 --> 15:38.230
Yeah. Hold on.

15:38.298 --> 15:39.577
Um... ah, here we go.

15:39.664 --> 15:42.188
It, uh... it says here
we can start

15:42.275 --> 15:44.704
with your earliest
memory of the trauma,

15:44.791 --> 15:47.323
your worst memory
or the most recent one.

15:47.642 --> 15:51.503
So, did... something traumatic
happen in the ocean?

15:52.696 --> 15:54.079
Uh, yeah.

15:55.050 --> 15:56.750
- Are you thinking about it?
- Mm-hmm.

15:56.837 --> 15:57.894
Okay. Just

15:57.962 --> 15:59.549
making sure
I'm doing it right.

15:59.947 --> 16:01.444
Um, okay.

16:01.531 --> 16:03.792
So, let's follow
my hand again.

16:14.892 --> 16:16.276
Close your eyes.

16:17.103 --> 16:18.670
Take a breath.

16:26.001 --> 16:27.643
What do you notice?

16:28.977 --> 16:30.807
I'm on the beach.

16:32.477 --> 16:34.090
What time
of day is it?

16:34.212 --> 16:35.619
Evening.

16:37.501 --> 16:38.956
Are you alone?

16:39.345 --> 16:40.540
No.

16:41.431 --> 16:43.370
I'm with some friends.

16:44.211 --> 16:46.206
We're having a barbecue.

16:49.149 --> 16:51.534
My son is playing in the surf.

16:52.946 --> 16:54.267
Your son?

16:58.751 --> 17:00.103
Okay.

17:00.900 --> 17:02.239
Good.

17:02.665 --> 17:04.189
Let's go with that.

17:16.832 --> 17:18.365
Close your eyes.

17:19.027 --> 17:20.435
Take a breath.

17:22.105 --> 17:23.715
What do you notice?

17:26.550 --> 17:28.162
It's getting late.

17:30.075 --> 17:32.677
The sun is going down,
and I'm cold.

17:38.879 --> 17:40.043
Okay.

17:40.746 --> 17:42.224
Let's go with that.

17:51.095 --> 17:52.724
Close your eyes.

17:54.575 --> 17:56.185
What do you notice?

18:03.152 --> 18:04.382
I-I don't know.

18:04.731 --> 18:06.128
Nothing. Just...

18:06.215 --> 18:07.626
- Nothing?
- Yeah.

18:07.770 --> 18:10.482
The beach, the sand,
our friends.

18:10.569 --> 18:12.099
It's more of the same.

18:13.955 --> 18:15.927
Okay. Um...

18:17.174 --> 18:19.037
We can try
this technique.

18:33.576 --> 18:35.209
Close your eyes.

18:41.582 --> 18:44.701
Now, what do
you notice?

18:47.489 --> 18:49.881
My husband isn't
paying attention.

18:51.271 --> 18:53.318
He's flirting with a woman.

18:55.044 --> 18:56.841
I just want to leave.

18:59.614 --> 19:01.011
I call out to my son.

19:01.098 --> 19:03.068
I tell him it's time
to come out.

19:05.614 --> 19:09.050
Cole says he's watching
the children and they're fine.

19:16.921 --> 19:18.473
Okay.

19:21.681 --> 19:23.151
Go with that.

19:40.342 --> 19:42.203
I'm inside my house.

19:43.284 --> 19:45.023
I've gone to get a blanket.

19:50.577 --> 19:52.591
I hear a commotion
from my window.

19:52.678 --> 19:53.873
Shouting.

19:55.186 --> 19:57.083
I look out, and I see
a group of people

19:57.170 --> 19:58.696
pulling something
from the water.

19:58.783 --> 20:00.187
It looks like a child.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.255
Okay. Good.

20:07.342 --> 20:09.125
Good. Let's go with that.

20:16.219 --> 20:17.913
Close your eyes.

20:19.795 --> 20:20.947
So...

20:21.450 --> 20:23.203
you're looking
out the window.

20:30.781 --> 20:32.798
I'm seeing something else now.

20:33.585 --> 20:35.250
- What do you see?
- I'm in the water.

20:35.347 --> 20:36.968
You're-you're in the water?

20:37.491 --> 20:38.550
I can't breathe.

20:38.637 --> 20:40.329
I'm choking on the water.

20:41.119 --> 20:43.339
My lungs are on fire.

20:45.041 --> 20:47.199
And then these hands, these...

20:47.286 --> 20:49.649
- Whose hands?
- Two big, strong hands are...

20:49.920 --> 20:52.040
pulling me
from the water, and...

20:54.008 --> 20:56.141
The air is warm.

20:59.707 --> 21:01.493
Okay, good.

21:01.897 --> 21:03.298
Go with that.

21:04.871 --> 21:06.395
I can't. I'm...

21:06.482 --> 21:08.141
I'm sorry. I can't.

21:16.246 --> 21:17.640
Alison.

21:22.385 --> 21:23.940
Are you all right?

21:25.641 --> 21:27.100
Yeah.

21:27.187 --> 21:29.323
You need anything?

21:34.744 --> 21:36.331
Want me to leave you alone?

21:38.937 --> 21:40.187
No.

21:45.664 --> 21:46.954
You know what
we should do?

21:47.070 --> 21:48.596
We should meet up
all over the country

21:48.683 --> 21:50.439
at different
PTSD conferences.

21:50.742 --> 21:51.866
What?

21:51.953 --> 21:54.340
Yeah, there's a,
uh, CPT conference

21:54.419 --> 21:55.819
happening in Milwaukee
in two weeks.

21:55.895 --> 21:56.948
You want to go?

21:57.187 --> 21:58.406
Seriously?

21:58.711 --> 21:59.903
I kind of like
this idea.

21:59.990 --> 22:02.704
It's like a really fucked-up,
quirky romantic comedy.

22:02.791 --> 22:04.118
Very Woody Allen.

22:04.205 --> 22:06.717
Yeah. Okay.

22:06.804 --> 22:08.186
Well, think about it.

22:08.273 --> 22:09.813
I'll text you
the information.

22:09.900 --> 22:11.556
Pretty sure it's
two weeks from now.

22:12.119 --> 22:13.770
Oh, no, I...
I don't think I can.

22:13.857 --> 22:16.134
I have my daughter
that weekend, so...

22:16.686 --> 22:20.142
Oh. Well, yeah,
that's more important.

22:20.520 --> 22:21.875
Yeah.

22:26.258 --> 22:27.931
Want to rent a boat?

22:29.608 --> 22:30.796
What, now?

22:30.883 --> 22:32.059
Yeah, right now.

22:32.146 --> 22:33.564
We'll go out
for the afternoon.

22:34.477 --> 22:37.036
What better way to get you over
this fear of the ocean, right?

22:37.123 --> 22:39.661
And since I clearly
fucked up your EMDR,

22:39.748 --> 22:41.306
I gotta find
another way.

22:41.398 --> 22:44.478
I'm thinking, uh,
immersion therapy.

23:09.537 --> 23:11.384
Alison, we got a boat.

23:11.625 --> 23:13.431
- Hey.
- Oh.

23:24.177 --> 23:26.024
You having fun yet?

23:26.344 --> 23:27.648
What?

23:27.983 --> 23:30.439
Are you having fun yet?

23:30.541 --> 23:33.803
I can't hear you.

23:34.665 --> 23:36.571
Never mind.

24:00.483 --> 24:01.953
Here we go.

24:07.077 --> 24:09.328
You hungry?
They packed us lunch.

24:09.415 --> 24:11.355
- Really?
- Yeah, it's, uh,

24:11.442 --> 24:12.511
right behind
the captain's seat

24:12.598 --> 24:14.039
- in the cooler.
- Oh.

24:23.994 --> 24:25.616
Ah, I'll put this away.

24:25.703 --> 24:26.899
No, don't worry
about it.

24:26.986 --> 24:28.394
Honestly, I'm fine.

24:28.510 --> 24:29.808
You should drink it.

24:30.052 --> 24:31.933
I bet you're a cute drunk.

24:36.642 --> 24:38.107
Was it hard?

24:38.194 --> 24:39.623
Getting sober?

24:40.350 --> 24:42.529
Yeah. Yeah, it fucking sucked.

24:42.697 --> 24:46.378
Uh, for a while,
I thought I'd rather be dead.

24:46.530 --> 24:48.532
But the person I am
when I drink

24:48.619 --> 24:51.417
is someone I hate,
and, uh,

24:51.718 --> 24:54.102
person I am when I'm sober,
well, that's...

24:54.192 --> 24:55.912
that's someone I can live with.

24:59.120 --> 25:01.297
- What about you?
- Me?

25:01.384 --> 25:03.854
Any chemical dependencies
I should know about?

25:04.063 --> 25:06.352
No. Miraculously.

25:10.103 --> 25:12.180
I did used to cut
myself, though.

25:14.616 --> 25:15.843
You mean...

25:15.930 --> 25:17.030
For fun?

25:17.254 --> 25:18.977
Yeah, kind of.

25:20.162 --> 25:21.672
To feel better.

25:24.011 --> 25:25.633
That's awful.

25:26.130 --> 25:27.422
Yeah, it was.

25:29.322 --> 25:31.211
Tried to kill myself once, too.

25:35.820 --> 25:38.859
Uh, I really don't know
why I'm telling you this.

25:39.246 --> 25:40.577
I...

25:42.199 --> 25:44.570
Maybe because you think
I'd understand.

25:49.094 --> 25:50.319
So...

25:51.222 --> 25:53.266
you have a son and daughter.

25:54.943 --> 25:56.984
I think I will have
some of that wine.

25:57.421 --> 25:58.483
Please.

25:58.577 --> 26:00.422
Yeah, thank you.

26:00.598 --> 26:01.620
Yeah, I got it.

26:01.707 --> 26:03.055
- All right.
- Yeah.

26:19.069 --> 26:20.633
I did have a son.

26:21.494 --> 26:23.000
But he drowned.

26:23.460 --> 26:24.772
Wh-What?

26:30.131 --> 26:31.522
So...

26:32.944 --> 26:35.281
that memory that day
at the, uh...

26:35.475 --> 26:38.500
at the beach with your husband
and the blanket,

26:38.587 --> 26:40.789
was that the day
your son...?

26:42.163 --> 26:43.553
Yeah.

26:44.577 --> 26:47.188
Oh, my God,
I'm sorry, Alison.

26:53.276 --> 26:55.552
What about the hands?

26:55.639 --> 26:57.745
You said they pulled him
out of the water

26:57.832 --> 26:59.025
and he was on the beach.
He could breathe.

26:59.112 --> 27:00.702
No, no, uh...

27:02.285 --> 27:03.858
that wasn't him.

27:04.733 --> 27:05.861
No, that was me.

27:05.948 --> 27:08.936
That was a, uh, dream
I used to have.

27:10.109 --> 27:11.297
That's why it's so weird

27:11.384 --> 27:13.002
that it came up again
in the EMDR.

27:13.089 --> 27:14.397
It just, uh...

27:16.950 --> 27:19.588
No, anyway, um,
Gabriel died that day.

27:19.675 --> 27:21.077
He was four.

27:21.823 --> 27:23.506
Nobody saved him.

27:29.031 --> 27:30.978
Anyway, you know,
it's taken me

27:31.065 --> 27:34.202
a very long time to say this
without wanting to die.

27:35.075 --> 27:36.702
My son drowned.

27:38.080 --> 27:39.413
He drowned.

27:44.344 --> 27:45.728
And...

27:46.230 --> 27:48.683
that's what you walk around
carrying every day?

27:49.385 --> 27:50.831
Your own son?

27:52.176 --> 27:53.369
Yeah.

27:54.752 --> 27:57.573
You seem so together,
so functional.

27:58.002 --> 28:00.112
I am, most days.

28:00.309 --> 28:02.151
It's taken me a while.

28:10.721 --> 28:12.417
What's that face?

28:13.702 --> 28:15.308
You amaze me.

28:21.575 --> 28:24.120
You know what's really weird
about that dream?

28:24.632 --> 28:26.933
When I'm drowning
and someone rescues me?

28:28.577 --> 28:30.839
I used to have it
all the time as a child.

28:31.510 --> 28:35.542
I remember being
five or six and...

28:35.875 --> 28:37.808
being afraid to go to sleep.

28:38.001 --> 28:40.464
Eventually, I stopped
having it, but...

28:41.017 --> 28:42.695
when Gabriel died,

28:43.424 --> 28:45.448
it all came rushing back.

28:46.174 --> 28:47.447
And the...

28:50.635 --> 28:52.253
It's the same beach.

28:53.837 --> 28:55.987
I can see the lighthouse
in the distance.

28:56.447 --> 28:59.175
I can see my house
behind me, past the dunes.

29:02.001 --> 29:05.511
And ever since, I've wondered
if it was a, um...

29:05.598 --> 29:06.847
Premonition.

29:09.234 --> 29:10.980
A premonition.

29:11.855 --> 29:13.597
Not a dream at all.

29:16.541 --> 29:18.120
So you think you saw

29:18.228 --> 29:20.643
what happened to your son
before it happened.

29:21.829 --> 29:24.260
If I say yes,
will you think I'm crazy?

29:25.056 --> 29:26.551
No.

29:27.408 --> 29:30.643
I think there's all sorts of
ways of knowing things, Alison.

29:33.267 --> 29:34.783
What if...

29:36.135 --> 29:37.657
What if something or somebody

29:37.744 --> 29:39.854
was trying to tell me
to watch out?

29:42.299 --> 29:43.854
Like, be ready?

29:46.064 --> 29:48.151
And when the time came,
I missed it?

30:00.942 --> 30:03.135
I haven't told
anyone this before.

30:04.191 --> 30:06.596
Not Cole. Not Noah.

30:10.595 --> 30:12.009
Come here.

30:14.220 --> 30:15.704
Why?

30:17.319 --> 30:19.307
I just want you to be closer.

30:31.635 --> 30:34.682
You know, a lot of people
have nightmares about drowning.

30:35.649 --> 30:37.635
Maybe it's just a...

30:37.841 --> 30:40.003
childhood fantasy
about being saved.

30:40.103 --> 30:41.897
But why would I dream
of the same beach

30:41.984 --> 30:43.385
where he died?

30:44.236 --> 30:46.229
Well, maybe you didn't
originally.

30:46.572 --> 30:48.776
Maybe you added
that part later.

30:49.447 --> 30:52.604
Maybe because you're looking
for a way to blame yourself.

30:57.400 --> 30:59.401
You'd make
a good shrink.

31:04.228 --> 31:06.721
What am I doing
on a boat with you?

31:07.130 --> 31:09.284
It was your idea.

31:14.231 --> 31:15.799
Should we head back?

31:20.108 --> 31:21.567
Okay.

31:23.908 --> 31:25.423
All right.

32:19.234 --> 32:20.912
Wait, wait.

32:24.246 --> 32:27.727
Well, this is
a complete disaster.

32:30.302 --> 32:31.655
Right.

33:29.994 --> 33:31.182
You all right?

33:31.303 --> 33:32.459
I'm fine.

33:32.546 --> 33:35.675
Geez. I thought you had
a fucking stroke.

33:37.426 --> 33:39.605
I was just trying
to get away from you.

33:41.340 --> 33:43.292
So much for your fear
of the ocean.

33:44.372 --> 33:46.202
You're insane.
You know that, right?

33:46.289 --> 33:48.870
Yeah, yeah.
I've heard that before.

33:57.063 --> 33:58.434
Hey, Ben?

33:58.521 --> 34:00.199
Hey, Alison?

34:00.774 --> 34:02.581
I'm having
a very nice time

34:02.668 --> 34:04.284
not having sex
with you.

34:05.532 --> 34:07.604
Well, don't get too used to it.

35:28.885 --> 35:31.313
What the fuck
are you doing, man?

35:31.400 --> 35:33.487
Come on.
We're going someplace.

35:33.713 --> 35:35.135
What?

35:35.780 --> 35:37.039
You and me?

35:37.126 --> 35:38.217
That's right.

35:38.304 --> 35:40.300
Uh-uh, dude. No way.

35:45.981 --> 35:47.745
What's that smell, man?

35:47.885 --> 35:49.331
Lighter fluid.

35:49.507 --> 35:51.769
Yo, I'm not going
anywhere with you.

35:51.856 --> 35:53.342
Fucking psychopath.

35:53.429 --> 35:54.836
Oh, I think
you are.

35:54.923 --> 35:56.956
Or else what, man?

35:57.430 --> 35:59.859
You're gonna
just light me on fire?

36:00.027 --> 36:01.580
I might.

36:04.353 --> 36:05.951
So it's now been, uh,

36:06.038 --> 36:08.304
six years, three months
and two days

36:08.391 --> 36:11.688
since the accident,
and, uh,

36:11.775 --> 36:15.292
I've rebuilt a bit of
a relationship with my kids.

36:15.827 --> 36:18.381
My ex-wife still
doesn't speak to me,

36:18.468 --> 36:20.550
but I can't say
I blame her.

36:20.822 --> 36:23.279
I saw her the other day
at the grocery store,

36:23.366 --> 36:25.690
and she pretended
not to see me.

36:27.379 --> 36:29.159
But one day
at a time.

36:30.556 --> 36:32.339
I thank God
every day

36:32.426 --> 36:34.454
that I'm still alive
and that I get to have

36:34.541 --> 36:38.972
another sunrise
to try to... do it better.

36:41.033 --> 36:42.155
Thanks.

36:42.242 --> 36:43.855
I'm being fucking kidnapped.

36:43.942 --> 36:45.284
No talking.

36:53.828 --> 36:55.780
Hi. My name is Ben,
and I'm an addict.

36:55.867 --> 36:57.464
- Hey, Ben.
- Hey, Ben.

36:58.470 --> 37:00.511
I'm so grateful
I found this meeting.

37:00.598 --> 37:02.909
I'm, uh... I'm not
from around here.

37:03.593 --> 37:06.139
I, uh... I woke up this morning

37:06.226 --> 37:08.019
just itching
for some blow, and...

37:08.505 --> 37:10.284
I knew I needed help.

37:10.822 --> 37:14.792
I've been, uh... I've been clean
for about seven months now,

37:15.338 --> 37:17.524
and it's been the hardest thing
I've ever done.

37:17.611 --> 37:19.940
And I did two tours
in Afghanistan.

37:21.559 --> 37:23.417
You know,
to be honest,

37:24.062 --> 37:25.946
the thing I struggle with
the most in the program

37:26.033 --> 37:29.847
is not the drinking,
but the abstinence.

37:33.153 --> 37:34.737
I miss women.

37:38.220 --> 37:41.909
But I know, for me, it's a...
it's a slippery slope.

37:42.476 --> 37:43.897
Girls make me want to drink,

37:43.984 --> 37:46.542
and, uh, drinking
makes me want to use.

37:50.260 --> 37:52.506
You know, when I got back
from the sandbox,

37:52.593 --> 37:56.151
I was... I was completely numb.

38:00.028 --> 38:02.105
Couldn't get it up for my wife,

38:02.369 --> 38:05.175
so I started drinking
in order to be able to fuck her.

38:06.024 --> 38:09.206
And then that led
to using,

38:09.635 --> 38:11.855
then our marriage
started to fall apart.

38:12.861 --> 38:16.190
Things that, uh,
used to make me happy,

38:17.176 --> 38:19.252
I couldn't feel
those things anymore.

38:21.227 --> 38:24.261
Couldn't feel anything
except angry.

38:25.931 --> 38:27.189
It was hell.

38:27.276 --> 38:28.426
I like this guy.

38:28.513 --> 38:29.212
<i>Any way...</i>

38:29.299 --> 38:30.670
You should ask him
to be your sponsor.

38:30.757 --> 38:31.748
No talking.

38:31.835 --> 38:33.592
<i>I haven't had
any PTSD attacks,</i>

38:33.679 --> 38:35.190
<i>and I've been feeling okay.</i>

38:35.305 --> 38:36.780
<i>You know, not good, not bad.</i>

38:36.867 --> 38:39.690
Just... just okay.

38:41.962 --> 38:44.284
And then I met this girl, and...

38:46.791 --> 38:49.519
She's like the woman I've been
looking for my whole life.

38:51.463 --> 38:54.769
But I spent the day with her
on a boat yesterday.

38:54.861 --> 38:57.151
I wanted to drink
so fucking bad.

39:00.382 --> 39:01.666
I didn't.

39:03.117 --> 39:04.391
That's why I'm here
this morning.

39:04.478 --> 39:07.245
One day at a time,
by the grace of God.

39:07.635 --> 39:09.128
So, thanks for letting me share.

39:17.306 --> 39:18.675
<i>I appreciate it.</i>

39:18.850 --> 39:20.659
<i>It's a great place,
so thank you.</i>

39:20.746 --> 39:22.722
<i>- You're welcome.
- Bye.</i>

39:26.457 --> 39:27.540
Hey, man.

39:27.670 --> 39:29.737
Hey. I'm Cole.

39:30.203 --> 39:31.275
Hi.

39:31.420 --> 39:32.932
That's Bram.

39:33.133 --> 39:34.561
I like what
you said up there.

39:34.648 --> 39:37.659
And he's new to the program.
He's looking for a sponsor.

39:39.330 --> 39:41.131
He's new to
the program, huh?

39:41.218 --> 39:42.628
Yeah. Day one.

39:42.861 --> 39:44.414
You think he's gonna
stick with it?

39:44.638 --> 39:47.089
Sure. He's 100% committed.

39:49.838 --> 39:52.670
Yeah, I'd like to, man,
but, uh, I'm not from out here.

39:52.757 --> 39:54.225
Headed back to Hicksville now.

39:54.312 --> 39:56.758
My wife, she goes crazy
with both kids

39:56.845 --> 39:58.141
on the weekends,
and I'm already late.

39:58.228 --> 40:00.159
What about the girl
you were talking about?

40:02.063 --> 40:04.199
You know how these
things are, man, right?

40:04.421 --> 40:05.808
It's complicated.

40:07.400 --> 40:08.698
Good to meet you, Cole.

40:08.785 --> 40:09.868
Good luck.

40:10.024 --> 40:11.370
You, too, kid.

40:17.111 --> 40:18.385
Hey, babe.

40:19.407 --> 40:20.885
Where have you been?

40:21.095 --> 40:23.011
Was trying to be
a Good Samaritan.

40:23.588 --> 40:25.058
Did it work?

40:25.213 --> 40:26.424
No.

40:34.033 --> 40:35.648
What's with all the paperwork?

40:35.735 --> 40:37.391
Studying for your LSATs?

40:37.478 --> 40:39.646
Why would I be studying
for the LSATs?

40:39.822 --> 40:41.897
I'm kidding.

40:42.752 --> 40:44.378
What's with all that stuff?

40:45.010 --> 40:48.237
Uh, they're my
immigration forms.

40:49.791 --> 40:51.111
Really?

40:51.838 --> 40:53.064
Yeah.

40:53.390 --> 40:56.589
I'm thinking about applying
for my citizenship after all.

40:56.760 --> 40:59.175
Nothing ventured,
nothing gained, right?

40:59.593 --> 41:02.487
Right, but isn't that something
we should talk about first?

41:02.682 --> 41:04.360
What is there to talk about?

41:04.447 --> 41:05.673
Well, the risk.

41:05.760 --> 41:06.922
What risk?

41:07.075 --> 41:08.288
That they would deport you.

41:08.375 --> 41:09.455
Yes.

41:10.174 --> 41:12.798
And that's why I need you
to sign something for me.

41:12.885 --> 41:13.787
What's that?

41:13.874 --> 41:15.594
That's the hardship waiver.

41:15.744 --> 41:17.423
My only chance
to become a citizen

41:17.510 --> 41:19.826
is by demonstrating
that my deportation

41:19.913 --> 41:21.841
would create hardship
for someone.

41:22.377 --> 41:23.632
So you want me to sign

41:23.719 --> 41:25.272
that it would create
hardship for me? Sure.

41:25.359 --> 41:27.324
No, not for you. Joanie.

41:27.600 --> 41:28.852
I'm confused.

41:28.939 --> 41:31.745
Look, Alison has a history
of mental illness.

41:31.832 --> 41:33.329
It's been
well documented.

41:33.416 --> 41:34.967
All we need to do
is send in records

41:35.054 --> 41:38.464
of her hospitalization to prove
that she's not a fit mother.

41:38.674 --> 41:41.808
But wait, I have
drafted this letter.

41:41.957 --> 41:45.094
It's a statement
on Joanie's behalf.

41:45.310 --> 41:46.738
I don't understand.

41:47.093 --> 41:48.913
I need you to ask Alison
if she will let me

41:49.000 --> 41:50.491
be Joanie's
legal guardian.

41:50.578 --> 41:54.120
Luisa, we just went
through this last year.

41:54.207 --> 41:55.160
I know.

41:55.603 --> 41:57.633
We gave her custody back.

41:57.720 --> 42:00.163
You wanted to do that.
That was your idea.

42:00.250 --> 42:02.727
Yeah, I know. It was a...
it was a mistake.

42:02.814 --> 42:04.095
A mistake for who?

42:04.182 --> 42:05.480
Well, for me.

42:05.757 --> 42:07.373
So you want me to ask Alison

42:07.460 --> 42:09.576
to declare herself
an unfit mother

42:09.663 --> 42:11.014
after everything
that she's been through?

42:11.101 --> 42:13.012
Yeah, but it would just
be on paper.

42:13.099 --> 42:14.784
Nothing would
have to change.

42:14.885 --> 42:17.151
We would still share
custody of Joanie,

42:17.697 --> 42:19.784
but I could submit these forms.

42:20.025 --> 42:21.717
Say I was her mother,
her only mother.

42:21.804 --> 42:23.043
And you don't think
they're going to check?

42:23.130 --> 42:26.334
No. Do you think an ICE agent
is coming to Montauk

42:26.421 --> 42:29.058
to check who picks Joanie up
from fucking kindergarten?

42:29.158 --> 42:31.261
They don't give
a shit, Cole.

42:31.424 --> 42:33.733
What they care, it's...
it's what's on the paper.

42:33.820 --> 42:36.274
- I can't ask Alison to do this.
- Why?

42:36.361 --> 42:38.698
Because it would
break her heart.

42:43.517 --> 42:45.048
Then I-I can't stay.

42:45.135 --> 42:46.595
Oh, stop being so dramatic.

42:46.682 --> 42:48.269
Of course you can stay.

42:48.924 --> 42:50.535
Everything is fine here.

42:50.622 --> 42:52.237
We have a great life.

42:52.324 --> 42:54.034
No, you have a great life.

42:55.135 --> 42:56.569
You are turning this
into a competition

42:56.656 --> 42:58.563
between you and her.
You are.

42:58.650 --> 43:00.128
Think about what you're doing.

43:00.215 --> 43:02.179
Think about what
you're asking me to do.

43:02.266 --> 43:03.210
I'm sorry.

43:03.297 --> 43:04.964
I-I can't go on like this.

43:05.729 --> 43:07.550
This is not a life for me.

43:07.637 --> 43:09.440
It might work
for you,

43:09.527 --> 43:11.504
but this whole
relationship,

43:11.591 --> 43:13.925
our marriage, it's been
on your terms, Cole.

43:14.064 --> 43:15.672
We live in your town.

43:15.759 --> 43:18.204
We see your family.
I work in your restaurant.

43:18.291 --> 43:19.753
I'll sell the restaurant.

43:20.101 --> 43:22.808
If that'll make you happy,
I will sell the restaurant.

43:26.271 --> 43:27.878
What if I get deported?

43:29.283 --> 43:30.730
Would you come with me

43:31.017 --> 43:32.202
back to Ecuador?

43:32.289 --> 43:34.878
And leave Joanie here?
Of course not.

43:38.968 --> 43:41.647
I'm tired of feeling
like your domestic help, Cole.

43:41.734 --> 43:44.324
Stop that.
You are my wife.

43:45.057 --> 43:46.488
Yeah, I live in this house.

43:46.593 --> 43:47.850
I cook your meals.

43:47.937 --> 43:49.905
I wash your clothes.
I care for your daughter.

43:49.992 --> 43:51.517
But I have nothing of my own.

43:51.604 --> 43:52.736
Me.

43:52.953 --> 43:54.798
You have me.

43:56.183 --> 43:57.557
Really?

43:58.824 --> 44:00.300
I don't know.

44:04.783 --> 44:06.214
I don't know.

44:08.199 --> 44:09.998
You're gonna pick Joanie up,

44:10.085 --> 44:11.569
right, at Alison's?

44:11.656 --> 44:12.776
Yes.

44:12.915 --> 44:15.551
Well, maybe you can talk to her,

44:15.799 --> 44:17.605
see what she thinks.

44:57.244 --> 44:58.486
Ma.

45:00.096 --> 45:01.564
Mom!

45:03.153 --> 45:04.603
Mom!

45:10.836 --> 45:13.565
Well, look who it is...
My wayward son.

45:18.705 --> 45:20.448
How's my granddaughter?

45:20.635 --> 45:21.920
She's good.

45:22.007 --> 45:23.784
She liked that thing
you got her.

45:23.879 --> 45:25.167
What thing?

45:25.275 --> 45:27.651
The stretchy thing
that makes a noise.

45:28.059 --> 45:29.464
The accordion?

45:29.551 --> 45:30.650
Yeah.

45:39.306 --> 45:40.839
What's wrong?

45:40.954 --> 45:42.380
What do you mean?

45:42.510 --> 45:45.401
You only eat like that
when something's wrong.

45:45.772 --> 45:46.969
Eat like what?

45:47.056 --> 45:49.183
Like someone's going
to take it away from you.

45:49.462 --> 45:51.720
All due respect, Mom,
I was raised with three brothers.

45:51.807 --> 45:53.980
Somebody usually was
going to take it away from me.

45:58.982 --> 46:00.378
How's business?

46:00.635 --> 46:02.917
What? It's fine.

46:03.741 --> 46:05.181
And Sheri?

46:06.103 --> 46:07.948
She's doing well.

46:10.770 --> 46:12.072
Do people laugh
when they figure out

46:12.159 --> 46:14.600
that this place is called
Sheri and Cherry's Fish Farm?

46:15.841 --> 46:18.717
No, you're the first person
to make that joke.

46:21.567 --> 46:23.928
Anyway, business
is thriving.

46:24.433 --> 46:26.953
Sheri appreciates
my operational experience,

46:27.040 --> 46:29.760
and I'm very happy
to be helping an old friend.

46:33.998 --> 46:35.629
It's very impressive.

46:36.417 --> 46:38.338
Sorry I haven't come
out here sooner to see it.

46:38.425 --> 46:40.325
It's only been for a few years.

46:40.512 --> 46:42.065
I know you've been
very busy.

46:42.152 --> 46:43.656
I just said I'm sorry, Mom.

46:43.743 --> 46:45.096
What do you want, Cole?

46:45.183 --> 46:47.406
You only ever come around
when there's something wrong,

46:47.493 --> 46:49.122
so what is it this time?

46:51.885 --> 46:53.894
I wanted to ask you
some questions.

46:53.981 --> 46:55.046
What about?

46:55.133 --> 46:56.687
About you and Dad.

46:58.253 --> 46:59.542
Okay.

46:59.665 --> 47:01.340
What about me and Dad?

47:02.995 --> 47:04.551
Were you happy together?

47:04.676 --> 47:05.909
Yes.

47:06.082 --> 47:07.276
The whole time?

47:08.768 --> 47:11.055
Well, your father
was a very unhappy man

47:11.142 --> 47:12.443
at the end of his life, Cole.

47:12.530 --> 47:14.916
Right, I know, so then how
could you have been happy?

47:15.306 --> 47:17.651
I loved him,
so I took all of him.

47:18.212 --> 47:19.862
How did you know?

47:19.977 --> 47:21.463
You just do.

47:26.887 --> 47:29.274
Luisa doesn't think
that I love her.

47:30.291 --> 47:32.557
Okay. Well, do you love her?

47:32.644 --> 47:33.805
Of course I love her.

47:33.892 --> 47:35.682
Well, then why
doesn't she know that?

47:35.769 --> 47:37.010
I don't know.

47:37.657 --> 47:40.549
She's a woman.
She's crazy.

47:42.540 --> 47:44.651
She wants me to ask Alison

47:45.491 --> 47:47.771
to renounce her rights
to being Joanie's parent,

47:47.858 --> 47:49.958
with the idea that it's gonna
help her get her citizenship

47:50.045 --> 47:52.174
if she's Joanie's
primary caregiver.

47:52.635 --> 47:55.119
Are you going to ask
Alison to do that?

47:57.614 --> 47:58.962
Why not?

48:04.514 --> 48:07.760
Okay, then.
Well, there's your answer.

48:13.590 --> 48:14.923
All right.

48:16.361 --> 48:17.623
Good talk.

48:20.006 --> 48:23.312
Why don't you take yourself
on a walkabout, Cole?

48:23.803 --> 48:25.135
Take myself on a what?

48:25.222 --> 48:27.439
I sent your father
on one years ago.

48:27.526 --> 48:29.065
Did him a world of good.

48:29.152 --> 48:30.276
You sent him on a what?

48:30.363 --> 48:32.386
- A walkabout.
- I don't know what that is, Mom.

48:32.473 --> 48:34.906
You know, the thing
they do in Australia.

48:34.993 --> 48:36.793
You want me to go
to Australia?

48:36.880 --> 48:39.374
You don't have to go
to Australia.

48:39.750 --> 48:41.636
Your father went
to California.

48:42.631 --> 48:44.296
What? When?

48:44.544 --> 48:46.388
Before you were born.

48:46.475 --> 48:47.851
For how long?

48:48.044 --> 48:49.648
About six months.

48:50.863 --> 48:51.911
Why?

48:52.128 --> 48:53.585
I asked him to.

48:53.987 --> 48:56.054
He seemed confused.

48:56.200 --> 48:58.913
I couldn't help him, so...

48:59.561 --> 49:01.373
I sent him off
to figure it out.

49:01.460 --> 49:03.970
Dad just disappeared
for six months?

49:04.057 --> 49:05.089
What did he do?

49:05.176 --> 49:06.648
I don't know exactly.

49:06.905 --> 49:08.137
I didn't ask.

49:08.224 --> 49:09.902
That was part of our deal.

49:10.483 --> 49:11.537
He left.

49:11.887 --> 49:14.393
Six months later,
he came back

49:14.480 --> 49:15.867
with a surfboard.

49:16.219 --> 49:17.906
He seemed a little lighter.

49:18.009 --> 49:19.395
And you don't know
where he went?

49:19.482 --> 49:21.648
Well, I know he went
to California,

49:22.076 --> 49:25.773
to a town with a giant rock
in the middle of the sea.

49:27.214 --> 49:28.659
I have a postcard from him.

49:28.746 --> 49:30.086
I'll find it for you.

49:34.064 --> 49:35.662
Hi, Daddy.

49:40.116 --> 49:41.570
Come here, kiddo.

49:43.108 --> 49:44.162
Hey.

49:44.615 --> 49:46.323
Hey. Look at you.

49:46.410 --> 49:48.314
- You look great.
- Thank you.

49:48.638 --> 49:50.087
Are you wearing heels?

49:51.260 --> 49:52.703
It looks like it.

49:52.951 --> 49:54.359
You're going somewhere?

49:54.446 --> 49:55.839
I have a date.

49:56.123 --> 49:58.023
Here's Joanie's stuff.

49:58.308 --> 50:01.106
I, uh, packed a swimsuit
because Luisa mentioned

50:01.193 --> 50:02.968
she's grown out
of the one at your house.

50:03.114 --> 50:05.386
And we made some
cookies this morning,

50:05.473 --> 50:07.403
so I put them in
a container for you guys.

50:07.490 --> 50:08.786
Oh, you didn't
have to do that.

50:08.873 --> 50:10.050
No, it's my pleasure.

50:10.137 --> 50:11.813
Hey. Bye, lovebug.

50:11.900 --> 50:14.485
Mmm. Not gonna
see you all weekend.

50:14.572 --> 50:16.219
- Bye, Mama.
- Bye, baby.

50:16.306 --> 50:17.331
All right. Off we go.

50:17.418 --> 50:19.153
Oh, hey.
I'm gonna stop by

50:19.240 --> 50:20.308
next week
with the paperwork

50:20.395 --> 50:21.886
for the sale
of the Lobster Roll, okay?

50:21.973 --> 50:23.259
Okay. Sounds good.

50:23.346 --> 50:26.978
Oh, no, no, uh, wait.
I want to ask, um...

50:27.191 --> 50:29.828
can you switch weekends
in two weeks?

50:31.250 --> 50:32.583
Uh, yeah.

50:32.670 --> 50:33.818
Sure. Why?

50:33.934 --> 50:35.471
I have this
PTSD conference

50:35.558 --> 50:37.367
I want to go to
in Milwaukee,

50:37.802 --> 50:40.453
and I want to sign up
before it gets too late.

50:41.834 --> 50:42.858
Done.

50:42.994 --> 50:44.757
Perfect. Thank you.

50:44.883 --> 50:46.373
All right, off we go.

50:46.460 --> 50:47.842
Have fun.

50:53.113 --> 50:54.754
Hey. Hey.

50:55.179 --> 50:56.481
Don't I know you?

50:56.949 --> 50:58.238
Cole?

50:59.199 --> 51:01.091
This is my friend Ben.

51:03.121 --> 51:04.794
Nice to meet you, Cole.

51:06.714 --> 51:08.591
Come on, Daddy.

51:21.882 --> 51:23.567
All righty.

51:26.660 --> 51:28.379
Good? All right.

51:33.550 --> 51:35.388
Be right back, kiddo.

51:42.929 --> 51:43.993
Hey. Listen.

51:44.080 --> 51:45.508
It's not what you think.

51:45.927 --> 51:47.417
I just... I'm sorry.

51:47.504 --> 51:49.799
I didn't want to make a scene
in front of your daughter.

51:49.996 --> 51:53.128
- Does she know you're married?
- No.

51:53.215 --> 51:55.034
- Of course not.
- Look, I'm gonna tell her.

51:55.121 --> 51:57.159
Sure you are.
Why don't I tell her myself?

51:57.246 --> 52:00.372
Hey, hey. My situation's
complicated, all right?

52:00.459 --> 52:01.661
My marriage is over.

52:01.748 --> 52:02.835
It's been over for years.

52:02.922 --> 52:05.219
I tried to stick it out
for the kids.

52:05.681 --> 52:06.806
Cole?

52:08.095 --> 52:09.619
Is everything okay?

52:11.353 --> 52:13.086
Yeah. Uh...

52:13.173 --> 52:14.732
Joanie forgot her goggles.

52:14.819 --> 52:17.017
Oh, sorry. One second.

52:21.430 --> 52:22.516
Thank you.

52:22.704 --> 52:23.880
Look, she's
the first person

52:23.967 --> 52:26.181
I met in ten years
that made me want to live.

52:26.626 --> 52:28.265
I'm gonna tell her the truth.

52:28.352 --> 52:29.502
Just give me a moment.

52:29.589 --> 52:31.752
Let me do it in the right way
at the right time.

52:33.989 --> 52:35.502
What are you guys
talking about?

52:35.593 --> 52:37.408
It turns out
we do know each other.

52:37.495 --> 52:38.555
You do?

52:38.779 --> 52:41.267
Yeah. We met
in an AA meeting.

52:41.522 --> 52:42.772
Oh. Yeah.

52:43.071 --> 52:45.119
Ben's a big believer
in the program.

52:45.415 --> 52:47.022
It saved his life.

52:47.477 --> 52:49.416
Hey, but why
were you there?

52:51.219 --> 52:52.672
I was just helping out a friend.

52:52.759 --> 52:54.047
Oh. Okay.

52:54.335 --> 52:55.529
You guys have a good weekend.

52:55.616 --> 52:56.797
Come on.

53:39.421 --> 53:40.813
What are you doing?

53:41.270 --> 53:42.478
Packing.

53:43.405 --> 53:44.980
Where are you going?

53:45.233 --> 53:46.454
I'm not sure.

53:46.541 --> 53:47.881
Luisa, stop.

53:48.057 --> 53:49.390
Please.

53:50.108 --> 53:51.787
Did you ask Alison?

53:53.353 --> 53:56.154
We have been over this
so many times.

53:56.241 --> 53:58.152
Any immigration judge
worth their salt

53:58.239 --> 53:59.347
is going to argue that you are

53:59.434 --> 54:00.766
legally auxiliary
to the functioning

54:00.853 --> 54:02.563
- of this family.
- Auxiliary?

54:03.303 --> 54:05.266
I said "legally."

54:06.171 --> 54:07.402
Where are you gonna go?

54:07.489 --> 54:09.002
I don't know.
To my mother's.

54:09.177 --> 54:10.558
Luisa, stop. Stop.

54:10.645 --> 54:11.706
Please, we can figure this out.

54:11.793 --> 54:12.999
No.

54:13.486 --> 54:14.790
I love you.

54:15.764 --> 54:18.719
And for years, I have been
waiting for you to choose me.

54:19.861 --> 54:22.047
For you to figure out
that I am...

54:22.134 --> 54:23.441
stronger and kinder

54:23.528 --> 54:25.688
and more capable
than she'll ever be.

54:26.466 --> 54:29.405
And that I am the one
worth fighting for.

54:29.492 --> 54:31.500
But you don't, and you won't.

54:44.338 --> 54:45.719
What if I left?

54:47.526 --> 54:48.526
What?

54:49.845 --> 54:52.539
What if I went on a...

54:52.944 --> 54:54.398
on a walkabout?

54:54.994 --> 54:56.406
What's that?

55:00.241 --> 55:02.383
I know I'm disappointing you.

55:03.570 --> 55:05.867
And I know I'm hurting you,
and you...

55:08.226 --> 55:09.703
..deserve better.

55:11.553 --> 55:13.109
So, what if I left?

55:14.475 --> 55:16.074
Would you be willing
to give me the time

55:16.161 --> 55:18.618
to just go away...

55:18.705 --> 55:19.811
Yes.

55:25.642 --> 55:26.767
Really?

55:27.812 --> 55:29.324
Yes, I would.

55:30.610 --> 55:32.383
I don't want this to end.

55:33.684 --> 55:35.758
I just need to know
that I matter.
