00:01.400 --> 00:03.160
Previously on St Elsewhere:

00:03.160 --> 00:05.240
Now what do I do?
Every nanny I've hired, you fired.

00:05.240 --> 00:07.160
Now what do I do?
Every nanny I've hired, you fired.
We'll have  to fend for ourselves.

00:07.160 --> 00:08.039
I'm Jacquie Wade.

00:08.039 --> 00:09.480
I'm Jacquie Wade.
         Carol Novino, hi.

00:09.480 --> 00:12.280
Carol was floor nurse here for
  seven years before med school.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.840
I need a pep-talk.
Do you have a minute?

00:13.840 --> 00:15.640
I need a pep-talk.
Do you have a minute?
No, I'm on my way to an M&amp;M meeting.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.080
I'm transferring you to OBGYN.

00:17.080 --> 00:19.760
I'm transferring you to OBGYN.
Being a surgeon is the only
thing that matters to me.

00:19.760 --> 00:23.040
I'm up half the night with Barbara
as it is while you're fast asleep.

00:23.040 --> 00:25.920
Honey, I perform surgery every day.
I need my rest.

00:25.920 --> 00:29.920
     What are we going to do?

01:52.560 --> 01:56.160
Look at all this, TV cameras,
reporters, photographers.

01:56.160 --> 01:57.760
   This is quite a media event.

01:57.760 --> 01:59.360
Just for a sculpture in the lobby?

01:59.360 --> 02:03.360
The Endicott family
wants to show their gratitude
 for saving their mother's life,

02:03.520 --> 02:07.080
so they got the Massachusetts Art
Council to commission Alex Corey.

02:07.080 --> 02:11.000
Still it doesn't seem right,
Â¤50,000 could be put to better use.

02:11.000 --> 02:15.000
Corey has received a lot of acclaim
since he painted my palm tree.

02:15.080 --> 02:19.080
Visiting professorship at Harvard,
showings at the NFA and in the Fog.

02:19.680 --> 02:22.280
If you ask me,
he's still in the fog.

02:22.280 --> 02:24.640
A paint by numbers job
      he did of Daniel.

02:24.640 --> 02:28.200
My granddaughter wets her diapers
with as much talent.

02:28.200 --> 02:31.080
We should be supportive
of Alex's endeavours here.

02:31.080 --> 02:34.600
After all, the sculpture is a gift.

02:34.600 --> 02:35.920
Yeah, right.

02:35.920 --> 02:37.560
Smile.

02:37.560 --> 02:40.160
OK, enough taking bows.
I've got to get upstairs.

02:40.160 --> 02:44.080
Ellen's coming by. I've got to mind
the baby while she has a meeting.

02:44.080 --> 02:48.080
Artist? Con artist!

02:51.760 --> 02:54.960
I'm supposed to watch you eat?
Finish the operation story.

02:54.960 --> 02:56.680
Just as Craig opens the chest

02:56.680 --> 02:59.400
the aneurysm explodes
      and blood everywhere.

02:59.400 --> 03:00.440
               And?

03:00.440 --> 03:03.920
I didn't realise what happened.
 All I knew was his heart

03:03.920 --> 03:06.000
was pumping five litres a minute.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.720
The cavity was filled to overflowing
and I couldn't see a thing.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.240
The cavity was filled to overflowing
and I couldn't see a thing.
          Don't stop now.

03:10.240 --> 03:11.840
Then Craig

03:11.840 --> 03:15.840
reaches into the chest and by
touch locates the aortic stump.

03:16.320 --> 03:18.360
Clamps it off
without missing a beat.

03:18.360 --> 03:19.360
             Amazing.

03:19.360 --> 03:20.520
             Amazing.
Settle down, Victor.

03:20.520 --> 03:24.200
What? Craig takes a one-in-a-million
shot, wins, and where am I?

03:24.200 --> 03:25.600
  Squeezing an old lady's tibia,

03:25.600 --> 03:28.760
forced to live the life of a surgeon
vicariously.

03:28.760 --> 03:30.600
Does anyone see an empty seat?

03:30.600 --> 03:32.880
You can have mine, Carol.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.240
That's very nice.

03:34.240 --> 03:38.040
Not really. I'm due at the
Crisis Intervention Centre.

03:38.040 --> 03:40.120
My community service assignment.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.360
I thought you did that
at the women's clinic?

03:41.360 --> 03:43.240
I thought you did that
at the women's clinic?
Nearly got blown up in the process.

03:43.240 --> 03:46.680
They said it didn't count.
Said I was only there an hour.

03:46.680 --> 03:50.360
Besides this is a nice, quiet desk
job answering the crisis hotline.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.000
Can't get hurt long distance.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.560
I hate the telephone.
You never know who it is,

03:54.560 --> 03:58.560
so you pick up and get stuck talking
to someone you wish hadn't called.

03:59.720 --> 04:00.320
Who's your friend?

04:00.320 --> 04:01.920
Who's your friend?
We don't know.

04:01.920 --> 04:04.720
        He was here first.

04:04.720 --> 04:08.720
Hi.

04:09.080 --> 04:11.920
Carol, how do you like
being a med student?

04:11.920 --> 04:14.680
That reminds me, I need the
result of that anti-body scan

04:14.680 --> 04:17.000
on Mrs Morinho by 9pm, OK?

04:17.000 --> 04:18.240
No problem.

04:18.240 --> 04:22.240
Amanda Rosenberg in room 4312 needs
a CGP started as soon as possible.

04:22.880 --> 04:24.520
No problem.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.520
Does that answer your question?

04:26.520 --> 04:29.320
     I feel like dessert. No.

04:29.320 --> 04:33.040
Stop, please, with the "I'm on a
diet" routine. Let's see what our

04:33.040 --> 04:35.480
friendly dieticians have prepared
in the way of sugary delights.

04:35.480 --> 04:39.480
friendly dieticians have prepared
in the way of sugary delights.
    I'll look but I won't eat.

04:40.400 --> 04:44.400
Carole, I don't know
       how you feel about

04:45.000 --> 04:49.000
going out with people
      you work with...

04:49.280 --> 04:53.280
You must have had a lot of lousy
 experiences dating doctors,

04:55.880 --> 04:57.680
especially residents. So...

04:57.680 --> 05:00.320
Those seats are taken, sorry.

05:00.320 --> 05:03.640
Look at the time.
I got to go pick up Pete.

05:03.640 --> 05:04.920
Oh.

05:04.920 --> 05:08.920
Jack, listen.

05:09.320 --> 05:11.120
Were you asking me out just now?

05:11.120 --> 05:13.120
Um, yeah.

05:13.120 --> 05:17.120
That's so sweet.

05:17.280 --> 05:20.280
Do you mind?

05:20.280 --> 05:22.440
Would you?

05:22.440 --> 05:23.720
Go out?

05:23.720 --> 05:26.320
Yes.

05:26.320 --> 05:27.120
No.

05:27.120 --> 05:29.880
No.
Thought not.

05:29.880 --> 05:32.280
I just can't afford to get involved
right now.

05:32.280 --> 05:34.880
I wasn't going to
ask you to marry me.

05:34.880 --> 05:37.000
Of course not.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.120
I think you're really attractive...

05:39.120 --> 05:39.640
Great.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.720
Great.
It's not just you.
      I don't want to date.

05:41.720 --> 05:42.560
I understand.

05:42.560 --> 05:43.880
I understand.
Oh, my God!

05:43.880 --> 05:44.920
            Nice shot.

05:44.920 --> 05:47.080
Excuse me.

05:47.080 --> 05:48.360
Jack, wait.

05:48.360 --> 05:51.880
Excuse me.

05:51.880 --> 05:53.080
 How long has he been unconscious?

05:53.080 --> 05:54.240
 How long has he been unconscious?
Two minutes, tops.

05:54.240 --> 05:54.920
          Whose patient?

05:54.920 --> 05:58.400
          Whose patient?
Dr Fiscus. Gone for the day.

05:58.400 --> 06:01.040
    Severe pneumonia, diabetes.

06:01.040 --> 06:04.560
His insulin's running wide open.
He's hypoglycaemic.

06:04.560 --> 06:06.080
              Abd 50.

06:06.080 --> 06:08.520
 Hang D-10 saline, 100cc per hour.

06:08.520 --> 06:10.560
This wouldn't happen if
the nurses watched the IVs.

06:10.560 --> 06:12.200
I just came on duty.

06:12.200 --> 06:15.400
Good for you. I've been on 18 hours
and I work another shift tonight.

06:15.400 --> 06:16.680
There's no excuse for
what happened here.

06:16.680 --> 06:17.960
There's no excuse for
what happened here.
Yes, Doctor.

06:17.960 --> 06:21.920
Have a sputum gram stain
and draw another blood sugar, please.

06:21.920 --> 06:23.040
Blood pressure's coming back up.

06:23.040 --> 06:26.680
Monitor his vital signs Q-5 minutes
for 30 minutes.

06:26.680 --> 06:30.680
    I'm going to get some air.

06:37.120 --> 06:39.040
Whoa! Hey! You a doctor?

06:39.040 --> 06:40.040
   I'm not the good humour man.

06:40.040 --> 06:41.480
   I'm not the good humour man.
My wife's having a baby.

06:41.480 --> 06:42.320
Need a wheelchair here?

06:42.320 --> 06:45.520
Need a wheelchair here?
               Yes.

06:45.520 --> 06:46.640
         I got it. Thanks.

06:46.640 --> 06:47.680
Careful.

06:47.680 --> 06:50.600
Easy, easy.
Put your feet up. In you go.

06:50.600 --> 06:54.480
Thanks.
Next stop, labour and delivery.

06:54.480 --> 06:58.360
Thought I was going to have my  first
kid in the middle of the corridor.

06:58.360 --> 06:59.480
        Don't blame Junior.

06:59.480 --> 07:01.840
Just searching for the light
at the end of the tunnel.

07:01.840 --> 07:03.920
Just searching for the light
at the end of the tunnel.
I've been having contractions

07:03.920 --> 07:06.200
every four minutes
and my water just broke.

07:06.200 --> 07:07.840
  Don't worry, I'm in deck shoes.

07:07.840 --> 07:09.920
How soon before she has the baby?

07:09.920 --> 07:10.960
       Hard to say just yet.

07:10.960 --> 07:12.440
Can I get some cigars?

07:12.440 --> 07:13.800
        Try the gift shop.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.880
And go to the admissions lobby
and check your wife in.

07:15.880 --> 07:18.320
And go to the admissions lobby
and check your wife in.
Right. Whoa!

07:18.320 --> 07:20.160
Back in a flash, babe.

07:20.160 --> 07:22.160
I love you.

07:22.160 --> 07:25.080
Oh! Here's another contraction!

07:25.080 --> 07:29.080
         Breathe with it.

07:29.480 --> 07:30.800
Nice jacket.

07:30.800 --> 07:32.800
  Doesn't come in size Zeppelin.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.360
Har-dee-har har.

07:35.360 --> 07:37.400
Crummy spring cold.

07:37.400 --> 07:39.840
Does the orange line
go to North Station?

07:39.840 --> 07:43.360
Yeah, it costs 60 cents.

07:43.360 --> 07:46.480
Last week my mother
forgot my birthday entirely.

07:46.480 --> 07:48.840
No present, card or even a call.

07:48.840 --> 07:50.240
      Happy birthday, Elliot.

07:50.240 --> 07:51.800
Yesterday I got a letter.

07:51.800 --> 07:55.280
"Dear Elliot. I decided to turn
your bedroom into my sewing room.

07:55.280 --> 07:57.000
"Clear out your things ASAP.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.640
"Love, Mom."

07:58.640 --> 08:02.040
Would you ask Dr Morrison to
keep an eye on Mrs Wicar for me?

08:02.040 --> 08:03.960
I'll look in on her.

08:03.960 --> 08:07.040
No, thanks. A lot of your patients
have hit the wall lately.

08:07.040 --> 08:10.440
Stephen Craig, Senator Endicott,
even Santa Claus.

08:10.440 --> 08:12.440
Look, you were there for
every single one of them.

08:12.440 --> 08:14.920
Look, you were there for
every single one of them.
       Don't start whining.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.880
      How you doing, Doctor?

08:16.880 --> 08:18.480
        How are you, bunny?

08:18.480 --> 08:21.720
               Yeah!

08:21.720 --> 08:23.080
She's getting so big.

08:23.080 --> 08:27.080
Out of my way, herkima jerkima.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.720
Please, don't come in.

08:30.720 --> 08:33.559
Oh, for Pete's sakes.

08:33.559 --> 08:35.960
This is my office.

08:35.960 --> 08:37.520
Ellen, what the heck
is going on here?

08:37.520 --> 08:39.960
Ellen, what the heck
is going on here?
Dr Craig, this was
supposed to be a surprise.

08:39.960 --> 08:42.080
Is your name Ellen?

08:42.080 --> 08:45.880
Oh, Mark, I was just
     rearranging your office.

08:45.880 --> 08:49.880
The question is why.

08:49.880 --> 08:52.840
I went through a lot of blood,
sweat and tears for that award.

08:52.840 --> 08:56.840
I could be wrong but I think this
will look a lot better over here.

08:59.800 --> 09:02.120
Ellen, my office
doesn't need rearranging.

09:02.120 --> 09:06.120
Don't be so resistant to change.
That's exactly what we talked about

09:06.280 --> 09:08.360
about this morning with
Dr Weiss in grief therapy.

09:08.360 --> 09:10.120
about this morning with
Dr Weiss in grief therapy.
I'm paying 40 bucks a session

09:10.120 --> 09:13.080
in order for you to become
    an interior decorator?

09:13.080 --> 09:15.440
I think you need all
new furniture in here.

09:15.440 --> 09:17.960
No smoking in front of the baby.

09:17.960 --> 09:21.120
I saw the greatest
partner's desk the other day.

09:21.120 --> 09:25.120
I don't need a partner's desk,
nor a partner for that matter.

09:26.120 --> 09:29.560
What I do need is for you
    to take care of the baby.

09:29.560 --> 09:32.000
And get my shirts.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.080
And cook dinner.
And do all the things

09:34.080 --> 09:37.320
that you've let slip ever
since you fired the housekeeper.

09:37.320 --> 09:40.600
Mark, I spoke to Dr Weiss
about the dedication plaque.

09:40.600 --> 09:43.120
He says it's a good idea.

09:43.120 --> 09:45.320
I don't want Stephen's name
memorialised

09:45.320 --> 09:47.840
on a mildewed wall at the pool.

09:47.840 --> 09:51.000
My son was a fine swimmer
but he didn't go to college

09:51.000 --> 09:52.760
to perfect his freestyle.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.160
He was preparing to be a surgeon.

09:55.160 --> 09:59.160
Would you help me
clean up this mess?

10:03.680 --> 10:07.680
SMASHING

10:08.040 --> 10:11.160
Oh, nice hands, Ellen.

10:11.160 --> 10:15.160
It took me 22 years
to win the Cushing Award.

10:16.440 --> 10:18.480
You did this on purpose.

10:18.480 --> 10:22.440
Damn you, Mark. I wish I had.

10:22.440 --> 10:24.280
Don't bother to come home tonight.

10:24.280 --> 10:28.280
I can't stand to be
around you anymore.

10:37.440 --> 10:40.480
We always try to have anywhere
from six to ten counsellors

10:40.480 --> 10:42.320
answering the phones at a time.

10:42.320 --> 10:45.120
There's always a consultant
available if you need help.

10:45.120 --> 10:47.480
Tonight I'm it.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.320
Calls run the gamut.

10:49.320 --> 10:52.520
Drugs, alcohol, suicide, loneliness,
eviction notices.

10:52.520 --> 10:55.400
Situations you and I'd consider

10:55.400 --> 10:57.800
normal stress might look like the
end of the world to someone else.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.400
 How far should I go with advice?

11:00.400 --> 11:03.760
People don't call to be confronted
or argued with.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.240
They're looking for
unqualified support.

11:05.240 --> 11:07.640
         So I lend an ear,

11:07.640 --> 11:11.640
encourage, recommend
professional help if necessary?

11:13.000 --> 11:15.440
It was easy doing
counsellor training.

11:15.440 --> 11:19.440
I'll stick around for
your first few calls.

11:22.520 --> 11:23.960
       Crisis Intervention.

11:23.960 --> 11:25.120
Hello?

11:25.120 --> 11:28.360
I guess I need to talk to somebody
about this. I don't know what to do.

11:28.360 --> 11:32.360
My husband gets drunk
and mean and he hits me...

11:36.440 --> 11:38.760
Donald, you're in luck.

11:38.760 --> 11:40.480
I happen to be free this evening so

11:40.480 --> 11:42.720
I'm treating you to dinner
at the Voyagers. They grow

11:42.720 --> 11:46.440
their own vegetables and herbs
and the wine list is staggering.

11:46.440 --> 11:50.440
I'm sorry, I can't. Lizzie is coming
home from Poughkeepsie tonight.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.480
   Ellen's visiting her mother?

11:52.480 --> 11:54.880
Er... Yeah.

11:54.880 --> 11:56.160
    You're welcome to join us.

11:56.160 --> 11:58.360
No, but thanks.

11:58.360 --> 11:59.600
I'll take a rain check on
the Voyagers, all right?

11:59.600 --> 12:02.320
It's not important.
I worry about you, Donald.

12:02.320 --> 12:06.320
Marine's been dead all these years
and you still burn a candle in the

12:06.640 --> 12:08.280
window every night.

12:08.280 --> 12:12.280
I'm not one to butt into your
personal affairs but, hell,

12:12.600 --> 12:15.920
you cut yourself out of one
of the true joys in life,

12:15.920 --> 12:18.320
the love of a good woman.

12:18.320 --> 12:21.280
It's the foundation on which a
man builds the rest of his life.

12:21.280 --> 12:23.000
No wonder you've become so boring.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.040
KNOCK ON DOOR

12:24.040 --> 12:25.560
What?

12:25.560 --> 12:27.520
Sorry.

12:27.520 --> 12:30.080
            Come on in.

12:30.080 --> 12:33.280
Need a consult. Hello, Dr Craig.
Meet Mr Kashin.

12:33.280 --> 12:36.320
                OK.

12:36.320 --> 12:40.320
Don't hang around
on my account, Mark.

12:42.840 --> 12:46.840
That's affecting the hilum.
Looks normal.

12:47.480 --> 12:50.280
Liver, spleen, no
redistribution of bone marrow.

12:50.280 --> 12:52.280
What's your differential
diagnosis, Carol?

12:52.280 --> 12:54.560
Tumour or large gall-bladder
   abscess.

12:54.560 --> 12:56.000
              Which?

12:56.000 --> 12:59.240
Jeez Louise,
   think for yourself, Novino.

12:59.240 --> 13:01.640
When you have an equivocal finding

13:01.640 --> 13:04.320
like that, confirm or dispute
that finding with similar tests.

13:04.320 --> 13:08.080
I was asking him for the consult.

13:08.080 --> 13:09.360
          Get a CAT scan.

13:09.360 --> 13:10.560
Thought so.

13:10.560 --> 13:13.600
Carol, Lizzie's coming home tonight.

13:13.600 --> 13:14.680
She'd love to see you over dinner.

13:14.680 --> 13:16.000
She'd love to see you over dinner.
Her first night home?

13:16.000 --> 13:18.760
Sure. Give us a chance to
talk about your residency here.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.120
Same house?

13:20.120 --> 13:24.120
Same house?
Yes, just look for the peeling
paint and bad shingles. About eight.

13:24.680 --> 13:28.680
I'll bring dessert.
Good night, Dr Craig.

13:32.800 --> 13:36.800
Donald, you old smoothie!

13:36.800 --> 13:40.800
    What are you talking about?

13:48.400 --> 13:52.120
Daniel, how about running round
the corner with me to Ruben's Deli?

13:52.120 --> 13:55.600
Strictly kosher and the
best pastrami outside New York.

13:55.600 --> 13:57.480
Am I your first choice
for dinner companion?

13:57.480 --> 13:58.920
To be honest, no.

13:58.920 --> 14:00.840
Then you're not mine.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.200
Catherine and I have plans.

14:03.200 --> 14:07.200
Nobody likes a wise guy, Daniel.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.280
Pneumonia's getting worse.

14:12.280 --> 14:14.080
Lungs are full of fluid.

14:14.080 --> 14:15.520
   I heard the code. What is it?

14:15.520 --> 14:17.160
Respiratory arrest.
I have to intubate.

14:17.160 --> 14:21.160
Get him on a respirator.

14:26.440 --> 14:28.400
   Easy. Watch the vocal cords.

14:28.400 --> 14:30.400
   Easy. Watch the vocal cords.
I know!

14:30.400 --> 14:31.760
            Need help?

14:31.760 --> 14:33.720
No, I can do this!

14:33.720 --> 14:37.720
Go see what's holding up
the ventilator, please.

14:40.720 --> 14:44.720
Check breath sounds.

14:45.040 --> 14:47.920
No, no good.
You put the tube in his stomach.

14:47.920 --> 14:51.920
No, no good.
You put the tube in his stomach.
Damn.

14:57.840 --> 15:01.840
Don't give me that look, Jack.
I can do this.

15:03.000 --> 15:06.920
OK.

15:06.920 --> 15:08.840
Check.

15:08.840 --> 15:12.840
Good. Good breath sounds.
Oxygen 100%, chest X-ray stat.

15:13.280 --> 15:17.280
Next time, Jack,
you treat me like a capable doctor.

15:21.040 --> 15:23.520
Please be careful.
We're not laying carpet.

15:23.520 --> 15:25.080
I'm polishing the rainbow.

15:25.080 --> 15:29.080
This guy is from the Twilight Zone.

15:29.720 --> 15:32.200
I've lost the energy,
the spontaneity.

15:32.200 --> 15:36.080
I've been sapped, drained,
my very emotions spirited away like

15:36.080 --> 15:40.080
valuables stolen by a thief in
the night and I am left empty.

15:40.520 --> 15:43.040
Am I to assume, Mr Corey,
that all is not going well?

15:43.040 --> 15:44.760
Laborare est orare.

15:44.760 --> 15:46.400
To work is to pray.

15:46.400 --> 15:49.720
And that is impossible with
hordes of people traipsing past.

15:49.720 --> 15:51.440
When visiting hours are over you can

15:51.440 --> 15:53.200
work through the night
without interruption.

15:53.200 --> 15:56.120
Being an artist is a burden
thrust on an unlucky few who are

15:56.120 --> 16:00.120
called upon like great mother birds
to regurgitate their very souls.

16:00.920 --> 16:04.040
Maybe you need a pick-me-up,
a candy bar, amphetamines.

16:04.040 --> 16:05.840
I'm sorry to see you
suffering like this.

16:05.840 --> 16:08.800
But sir, from weakness
comes strength.

16:08.800 --> 16:11.600
From infirmity, inspiration.

16:11.600 --> 16:15.000
I'll walk through the wards and
gaze upon the sick and the dying.

16:15.000 --> 16:19.000
That should invigorate me.

16:21.640 --> 16:23.080
Sweets.

16:23.080 --> 16:26.280
I need you to page Dr London
for me for a consult.

16:26.280 --> 16:27.800
Ehrlich!
What's up?

16:27.800 --> 16:30.160
I think I have
     a cardiac problem, sir.

16:30.160 --> 16:32.280
Not me, of course. This patient.

16:32.280 --> 16:34.360
Diane Imperi.
She presented two hours ago.

16:34.360 --> 16:37.240
Last glance she was four centimetres
dilated at station plus one.

16:37.240 --> 16:39.160
No pre-natal care.

16:39.160 --> 16:42.480
She has a history of childhood
rheumatic fever, soft mitral murmur.

16:42.480 --> 16:44.480
You're the soft one, Ehrlich.

16:44.480 --> 16:46.800
Working in obstetrics
these past three months.

16:46.800 --> 16:49.840
Everything I taught you leaked
out of that mealy casaba of yours.

16:49.840 --> 16:52.000
Don't interrupt.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.880
Mrs Imperi's murmur may
have no significance.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.280
Fluid in her lungs
could be non-cardiogenic.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.320
You should have
ordered a cardiac echo.

16:59.320 --> 17:02.280
Already took the liberty, sir.
Right here.

17:02.280 --> 17:04.119
I'll look in on Mrs Imperi.

17:04.119 --> 17:05.880
Oh, no.
You don't want to trouble yourself.

17:05.880 --> 17:07.880
You've got enough problems. Go eat.
You probably need the time alone.

17:07.880 --> 17:09.680
Just pay attention to Mrs Imperi.

17:09.680 --> 17:12.480
Would you call my wife?
Tell her I have a consult.

17:12.480 --> 17:14.720
She shouldn't wait up.
Lead the way.

17:14.720 --> 17:18.720
Leave that here. Come on.

17:20.079 --> 17:21.520
Oh, no.

17:21.520 --> 17:21.880
              Lizzie?

17:21.880 --> 17:22.880
Up here, Dad.

17:22.880 --> 17:24.000
Mess.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.240
       Yeah. You all right?

17:26.240 --> 17:27.440
The handle broke.

17:27.440 --> 17:28.880
Whose sports car is
that in the driveway?

17:28.880 --> 17:31.640
Steve's.
He rented it to me over vacation so

17:31.640 --> 17:34.840
I could bring my stuff home.
25 bucks unlimited mileage.

17:34.840 --> 17:38.840
Tommy help.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.800
Lizzie, I've been
thinking about this.

17:42.800 --> 17:44.600
 I know we made a deal that after

17:44.600 --> 17:46.920
your freshman year we'd talk about
whether you had to go back or not.

17:46.920 --> 17:50.600
Dad, the deal was I got to decide
and I have.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.880
I'm transferring to BC
and I'm going to live here.

17:53.880 --> 17:56.920
I just don't understand why
you're rushing to come home.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.200
I'll go start dinner.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.840
    Oh, nuts. I got so excited

17:59.840 --> 18:01.360
about seeing you I forgot
to stop at the market.

18:01.360 --> 18:03.320
No biggie. I'll
check and see what's in the kitchen.

18:03.320 --> 18:04.320
   I invited Carol Novino over.

18:04.320 --> 18:07.480
You what?
Dad, look at this place! Look at me.

18:07.480 --> 18:10.360
She's practically family.
What are you worried about?

18:10.360 --> 18:14.240
Carry this stuff up as quick as
you can and shut my bedroom door.

18:14.240 --> 18:16.080
      That's not a toy, son.

18:16.080 --> 18:19.560
Tell that to Rick.

18:19.560 --> 18:23.200
PHONE RINGS

18:23.200 --> 18:25.360
Crisis Intervention. This is Phil.

18:25.360 --> 18:28.920
          My name is Amy.

18:28.920 --> 18:30.040
How old are you, Amy?

18:30.040 --> 18:33.280
                17.

18:33.280 --> 18:37.280
Why did you call tonight?

18:40.560 --> 18:44.560
Excuse me.

18:46.080 --> 18:47.040
             I'm back.

18:47.040 --> 18:47.720
Honey.

18:47.720 --> 18:51.000
I went over to Fantomas
and bought a round in celebration.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.840
Have OR2 prepped. Page Wade
and Kiley. Notify NICU stat.

18:53.840 --> 18:56.000
What's going on?
What?

18:56.000 --> 18:58.960
What's going on?
What?
Ehrlich.

18:58.960 --> 19:01.080
Rails throughout both lungs.

19:01.080 --> 19:02.920
Jugular venous distension to
the edge of her jaw.

19:02.920 --> 19:03.800
          What happened?

19:03.800 --> 19:05.240
Heart rate's 80.

19:05.240 --> 19:07.960
You'll have to perform a C-section.
I'll follow up with the
commissurotomy.

19:07.960 --> 19:09.440
    Where are you taking Diane?

19:09.440 --> 19:10.320
Emergency surgery.

19:10.320 --> 19:13.320
The baby's in distress and your
wife's gone into heart failure.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.240
              Diane.

19:15.240 --> 19:19.240
  I won't leave you, sweetheart.

19:21.720 --> 19:25.720
My parents couldn't care less if
I was around so I won't be.

19:26.760 --> 19:29.960
Amy, are your mother
and father at home now?

19:29.960 --> 19:33.960
Gone overnight in Providence.
Attending one of their fundraisers.

19:35.760 --> 19:38.840
My parents pretend to
be gun-control fanatics.

19:38.840 --> 19:40.720
      But Dad has a revolver.

19:40.720 --> 19:43.160
He hides it.
Thinks nobody knows but Mom.

19:43.160 --> 19:47.160
            Hypocrites.

19:48.280 --> 19:50.280
Yeah, I know, it's upsetting hearing

19:50.280 --> 19:52.640
people say one thing and
watching them do another.

19:52.640 --> 19:54.920
What would be funny would
to see if my parents can

19:54.920 --> 19:56.720
double talk their way out of that.

19:56.720 --> 19:59.800
Amy, I've got a better idea.

19:59.800 --> 20:02.600
Why don't you tell me
what's upsetting you?

20:02.600 --> 20:04.040
What made you pick today?

20:04.040 --> 20:06.760
    It's just the end, enough.

20:06.760 --> 20:08.240
Why?

20:08.240 --> 20:09.960
You don't want to know.
You're just some guy named Phil

20:09.960 --> 20:11.800
who picked up the phone.
Why should you care?

20:11.800 --> 20:15.440
Amy, that's what I'm here for.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.960
You really
want to know why I called, Phil?

20:17.960 --> 20:21.440
Because a month from now, after I'm a
bad memory, the phone bill's going to

20:21.440 --> 20:24.320
come in the mail and Dad will open
it up and double check the charges

20:24.320 --> 20:27.480
that like he always does, only he
won't recognise the hotline number.

20:27.480 --> 20:30.360
So he'll call to see who's on the
other end.

20:30.360 --> 20:31.880
   When he does, say hi for me.

20:31.880 --> 20:35.880

Hi.

20:51.880 --> 20:54.520
I have dessert.

20:54.520 --> 20:57.440
              Thanks.

20:57.440 --> 20:58.320
Tommy, hi.

20:58.320 --> 20:59.600
I did it this time, Carol, royally.

20:59.600 --> 21:00.680
I did it this time, Carol, royally.
What?

21:00.680 --> 21:02.960
I invite you for dinner and all
we have are broccoli stalks,

21:02.960 --> 21:04.000
   zucchini and five mushrooms.

21:04.000 --> 21:05.560
   zucchini and five mushrooms.
I can come back another night.

21:05.560 --> 21:08.600
Don't be silly. You're here.
Sit down and make yourself at home.

21:08.600 --> 21:09.880
Where's Lizzie?

21:09.880 --> 21:12.840
I sent her to Chicken Lickin' in
case the vegetable souffle falls.

21:12.840 --> 21:15.080
At least let me help.

21:15.080 --> 21:15.400
I'm hungry.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.560
I'm hungry.
         OK, son. Come on.

21:17.560 --> 21:19.160
 I need you to break a dozen eggs.

21:19.160 --> 21:22.600
All right.

21:22.600 --> 21:25.360
Well, you're 11 short.

21:25.360 --> 21:26.640
              Great!

21:26.640 --> 21:30.640
Tell you what. Why don't we just go
to a nice restaurant?

21:31.120 --> 21:32.280
Carol, hi.

21:32.280 --> 21:35.320
Carol, hi.
Lizzie, hi.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.960
Hi, honey.

21:37.960 --> 21:39.520
You look great.

21:39.520 --> 21:42.720
You guys, this chicken smells
really bad and it's cold.

21:42.720 --> 21:45.680
Don't panic.
Let's see, how does everyone

21:45.680 --> 21:47.440
feel about stir-fried vegetables?

21:47.440 --> 21:49.920
Great. We could throw
that chicken in there.

21:49.920 --> 21:51.960
    What do you want me to do?

21:51.960 --> 21:52.640
Open the wine.

21:52.640 --> 21:54.800
                OK.

21:54.800 --> 21:56.760
Me, too, Dad.

21:56.760 --> 21:59.320
Fill it to the rim.

21:59.320 --> 22:00.520
We need some music.

22:00.520 --> 22:03.680
# RAMONES:
    Rock N Roll High School

22:03.680 --> 22:07.680
Tommy hungry.

22:20.320 --> 22:21.400
Hey, great song.

22:21.400 --> 22:25.400
You should see the movie.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.040
How long have you been a counsellor?

22:38.040 --> 22:39.760
Five years.

22:39.760 --> 22:41.840
I used to be a bank officer.

22:41.840 --> 22:44.480
Took early retirement.

22:44.480 --> 22:48.480
Worked on the Hancock
Towers, 52nd floor.

22:48.600 --> 22:51.600
Michael Whitfield.

22:51.600 --> 22:53.600
He had the office
     down the hall from mine.

22:53.600 --> 22:56.320
I never paid much attention to him.

22:56.320 --> 22:59.960
Well, one Friday the pressure
  got to Michael.

22:59.960 --> 23:02.280
I watched him take a dive
out through the window,

23:02.280 --> 23:04.560
blasted right through the glass.

23:04.560 --> 23:08.440
Thanks.

23:08.440 --> 23:11.160
People need help, someone to listen.

23:11.160 --> 23:13.440
Nobody makes the effort.

23:13.440 --> 23:17.440
So we set up hotlines and
sympathise over the telephone.

23:19.040 --> 23:21.080
What a way to reach out.

23:29.840 --> 23:33.680
I'm sorry. Could you speak up?

23:33.680 --> 23:36.960
Homosexual. See, I play on a
pro sports team here in Boston.

23:36.960 --> 23:40.280
It seems like I'm patting my
team-mates on the butt a lot lately.

23:40.280 --> 23:42.400
Is this your idea of a joke?

23:42.400 --> 23:44.920
If I'm gay and my fans find
out they'll never forgive me.

23:44.920 --> 23:46.520
Besides, I'm late for the whirlpool

23:46.520 --> 23:48.960
and the guys are waiting for me.
I've got the soap.

23:48.960 --> 23:52.960
Jackass.

23:53.560 --> 23:54.560
You never cut anyone off.

When they tie up the line

23:55.640 --> 23:57.440
so that those that really
need help can't get through?

23:57.440 --> 24:01.120
People ask for help
in different ways.

24:01.120 --> 24:03.560
You're here to listen,

24:03.560 --> 24:07.560

SOFT MUSIC

24:09.440 --> 24:10.880
What's this crap?

24:10.880 --> 24:13.560
Meditation tape. Creates a
harmonious atmosphere which helps

24:13.560 --> 24:17.040
to minimise the shock to the baby
when it's born. Number 11 scalpel.

24:17.040 --> 24:19.120
Is that what you do in OBGYN?

24:19.120 --> 24:21.440
Give people a false
sense of security?

24:21.440 --> 24:23.800
We could lose both the
baby and the mother here.

24:23.800 --> 24:25.520
I'm aware of that, sir.

24:25.520 --> 24:27.360
Jacquie, be the meter reader.

24:27.360 --> 24:31.000
Foetal heart rate's dropped
to 90 after the last contraction.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.720
I'm going through the uterine wall.

24:32.720 --> 24:35.680
Retractor.

24:35.680 --> 24:39.680
Give the fundus a goose.

24:41.200 --> 24:43.160
We're trying to deliver
a baby here, Corey.

24:43.160 --> 24:45.560
What the hell are you looking for?

24:45.560 --> 24:46.600
Inspiration.

24:46.600 --> 24:50.600
If you don't buzz off, you'll find
inspiration on the end of my foot.

24:54.480 --> 24:56.520
How can you work in this light?

24:56.520 --> 25:00.520
Here we go.

25:00.640 --> 25:04.640
The abdominal incision is too small.
Give yourself more room.

25:04.640 --> 25:08.640
Dr Craig, how about you
please give me some more room?

25:09.960 --> 25:13.640
OK, Jacquie. Hold that retractor.
Give me a lot of pressure now, OK?

25:13.640 --> 25:17.040
That's it, that's it.
Here we go.

25:17.040 --> 25:18.320
It's a little Miss Imperi.

25:18.320 --> 25:22.000
Dr Craig, I'm clamping and
cutting the cord.

25:22.000 --> 25:26.000
BABY CRIES

25:27.600 --> 25:31.280
OK, let's get this OR
back into shape.

25:31.280 --> 25:34.320
Ehrlich and Wade, you two close.

25:34.320 --> 25:37.000
Judy, turn off that racket
and give me more light.

25:37.000 --> 25:39.440
Dr Kiley, step in to assist.

25:39.440 --> 25:41.320
Dr Carp, listen up.

25:41.320 --> 25:45.000
I want hematocrits and
blood gases every 15 minutes.

25:45.000 --> 25:49.000
Scottie, keep up with
me, we're going to move.

25:51.400 --> 25:53.040
Hey!

25:53.040 --> 25:56.960
How's Marcy these days? She had a
pretty good thing going with me.

25:56.960 --> 25:59.400
I thought I'd call her up,
    take her to a movie.

25:59.400 --> 26:02.000
Break up her nights of washing
her hair and doing laundry.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.920
      Elliot, she's married.

26:04.920 --> 26:06.560
Wait, you're kidding me.

26:06.560 --> 26:08.320
I didn't even know she was engaged.

26:08.320 --> 26:10.160
She didn't invite me to the wedding.

26:10.160 --> 26:12.280
   She didn't invite any of us.

26:12.280 --> 26:15.400
She's embarrassed, huh?
Did she settle for a zhlob?

26:15.400 --> 26:18.520
Maybe I'll give her a ringy ding
and cheer her up.

26:18.520 --> 26:21.320
Be sure to dial early,
there's a nine-hour difference.

26:21.320 --> 26:22.040
To where?

26:22.040 --> 26:24.760
Zurich.
She married a chocolatier.

26:24.760 --> 26:27.760
She and Klaus have a cute little
cottage at the foot of the Alps.

26:27.760 --> 26:29.600
      Sent me some snapshots.

26:29.600 --> 26:33.600
 I'll show them to you some time.

26:42.560 --> 26:44.680
Notice the sunken eyes.

26:44.680 --> 26:48.480
The sallow skin, the hoary visage.

26:48.480 --> 26:51.600
Tres pathetique.

26:51.600 --> 26:53.720
Are you a doctor?

26:53.720 --> 26:55.680
Alex Corey, the artist.

26:55.680 --> 26:59.680
Call yourself gone.

27:13.720 --> 27:17.720
Go back to sleep, Mr Fogel.

27:42.640 --> 27:45.920
Yes, I'm here.

27:45.920 --> 27:49.920
Mr Wilac in 3221 wants to talk to
a doctor about his sore throat.

27:53.080 --> 27:57.080
Right, I'm coming.

28:06.160 --> 28:08.760
I'd love to do my
residency at St Eligius.

28:08.760 --> 28:12.040
It's just I don't want any special
favours just because you know me.

28:12.040 --> 28:14.480
If you didn't show
promise I'd agree with you.

28:14.480 --> 28:16.520
People will talk.

28:16.520 --> 28:19.560
Let them talk.
Why shouldn't I help somebody I like?

28:19.560 --> 28:23.200
Why should you be penalised
because we're friends?

28:23.200 --> 28:24.440
Daddy, play.

28:24.440 --> 28:25.480
           Later, sport.

28:25.480 --> 28:26.280
Daddy!

28:26.280 --> 28:29.280
Don't worry about me. I have to get
back to Mr Casiono's liver anyway.

28:29.280 --> 28:30.600
Dad, I'll finish up here.

28:30.600 --> 28:32.240
                OK.

28:32.240 --> 28:33.120
           Come on, kid.

28:33.120 --> 28:35.840
Will you stack?
My lower back's had enough.

28:35.840 --> 28:39.800
Sure.

28:39.800 --> 28:42.920
Your dad tells me you want
to leave Vassar and move home.

28:42.920 --> 28:46.720
Yeah, and like every other time I
try and do what I want, he reacts

28:46.720 --> 28:48.880
with that furrowed forehead.

28:48.880 --> 28:50.520
Most girls want to move out, be on

28:50.520 --> 28:52.480
their own, be free to travel,
check up.

28:52.480 --> 28:55.720
I've done all that.

28:55.720 --> 28:57.520
Still, it doesn't seem...

28:57.520 --> 28:57.840
Normal?

28:57.840 --> 28:58.840
Well...

28:58.840 --> 29:00.040
You're 35 and still live at home.

29:00.040 --> 29:03.080
That's financial.
That's how I'm in medical school.

go to nursing school. Spending time

29:06.520 --> 29:08.800
away in college with kids your own
age should be very exciting for you.

29:08.800 --> 29:11.240
This place is a disaster.

29:11.240 --> 29:15.240
One can of soup, a box of stale
saltines, forks without knives, cups

29:15.680 --> 29:17.920
without saucers.
They need me.

29:17.920 --> 29:21.920
Hey, I'm not against you on this.
I'm just looking to see that

29:21.920 --> 29:23.480
you're asking yourself the
right questions. That's all.

29:23.480 --> 29:27.480
I think I have.

31:55.840 --> 31:58.960
Not the IV, I want to inject
directly into the heart.

Come on, you're not
gonna die on me, you've tried twice

32:01.720 --> 32:04.920
already today, three terms is not a
charm, not today. I don't have time.

32:04.920 --> 32:08.040

32:09.600 --> 32:12.200
Ready.
              Clear!

32:12.200 --> 32:14.080

PA's 38 over 14, husband by her side.

Which makes me wonder of course
why you're not by Mrs Craig's.

33:11.280 --> 33:13.640
None of your damn business.

33:13.640 --> 33:14.960
         Words to live by.

33:14.960 --> 33:18.960
Hold on a minute.

33:23.880 --> 33:27.880
You know, you should thank me
for sending you to OBGYN.

33:31.600 --> 33:33.320

Reached out to those who needed you.

33:43.640 --> 33:46.880

sudden, I mean, for me to

watched with endless fascination the

mystery of life unfolding before me!

34:22.120 --> 34:23.960
What kind of
pap are you trying to smear?

34:23.960 --> 34:26.360
The miracle of birth, you
saw it yourself tonight.

34:26.360 --> 34:27.760
I saw an emergency C-section.

34:27.760 --> 34:31.400
What about witnessing the joy
on a mother's face?

34:31.400 --> 34:33.120
Mrs Imperi was unconscious!

34:33.120 --> 34:35.440
Sir, I need time to
consider your offer.

34:35.440 --> 34:39.440
Fine.

34:42.199 --> 34:46.199
         When do I start?

34:55.440 --> 34:58.280
We're gonna get you nice and
clean for school tomorrow.

34:58.280 --> 34:59.680
Want a bite?

34:59.680 --> 35:00.480
                No.

35:00.480 --> 35:01.080
                No.
Good.

35:01.080 --> 35:03.800
OK, sport, time to shampoo your hair.

35:03.800 --> 35:06.440
Honey, we have to talk
about your transferring.

35:06.440 --> 35:09.000
Dad, why are you so anxious
   for me to stay at Vassar?

35:09.000 --> 35:10.800
Because I think it's a good school.

35:10.800 --> 35:14.720
So is BC but you still
want me to grow old in Poughkeepsie.

35:14.720 --> 35:17.680
You know, you treat college like a
prison, do your time and get out.

35:17.680 --> 35:18.560
           That's right.

35:18.560 --> 35:20.880
It isn't right, there's
more to it than that.

35:20.880 --> 35:22.760
Look, sweetheart,

35:22.760 --> 35:24.440
I'm just worried that if you hang
around here you're going to miss

35:24.440 --> 35:26.800
some wonderful years, years
you're never gonna have again.

35:26.800 --> 35:30.800
    Dad, you and Tommy need me.

35:31.760 --> 35:35.040
You know, honey, I was
six years old,

35:35.040 --> 35:37.920
when my mother and brothers and
sisters were killed in that fire.

35:37.920 --> 35:41.920
I had to grow up very fast,
too fast. And I swore that

35:42.400 --> 35:45.800
my children were gonna enjoy just
being kids, you know what I mean?

35:45.800 --> 35:47.360
And then we lost your mother, and I

35:47.360 --> 35:50.160
put the same pressure on
you that my father put on me.

35:50.160 --> 35:52.400
You were only 10 years old,
   for Pete's sake,

35:52.400 --> 35:54.040
and I burdened
you with the responsibility of

35:54.040 --> 35:56.240
holding this family together. Cos I
wasn't strong enough to do it alone.

35:56.240 --> 35:57.520
My eyes hurt.

35:57.520 --> 36:01.520
OK. Just a minute.

36:03.600 --> 36:05.200
    Tommy, no! Tommy, come on.

36:05.200 --> 36:09.200
OK. It'll be all right. OK?

36:10.080 --> 36:11.200
Hurt gone?

36:11.200 --> 36:12.400
Guess neither one of us
will need to take a shower.

36:12.400 --> 36:13.760
Huh!

36:13.760 --> 36:17.400
OK, Tommy, we're almost done, Dad
will read you Good Night Moon, OK?

36:17.400 --> 36:19.600
Guess I'd better change, huh?

36:19.600 --> 36:23.480
Hey, Dad, I do understand what you're
saying, you know, I really hated you

36:23.480 --> 36:26.200
when you forced me to go back
to Vassar, and you're right,

36:26.200 --> 36:30.200
being an adult is living with the
consequences of the choices I make.

36:30.720 --> 36:33.760
Who knows, cos maybe some day
I'll regret moving home.

36:33.760 --> 36:36.960
 But for now it's the right thing.

36:36.960 --> 36:38.240
Well, welcome home.

36:38.240 --> 36:40.200
  Cheer up, it's gonna be great.

36:40.200 --> 36:43.760
Yeah, OK.

36:43.760 --> 36:47.760
I'd, er, rather not give my name,
but, er, you can call me Don.

36:51.520 --> 36:54.640
   OK, Don, what's on your mind?

36:54.640 --> 36:57.040
I'm feeling depressed.

36:57.040 --> 36:58.800
            What about?

36:58.800 --> 37:02.800
My life.
Such as it is.

37:03.360 --> 37:06.200
Have you tried talking
to anyone about it?

37:06.200 --> 37:08.520
I don't have many friends,

37:08.520 --> 37:10.920
outside of my job.

37:10.920 --> 37:12.760
And if I talk with any of them,

37:12.760 --> 37:15.200
they just think I'm weak,
    can't cut it.

37:15.200 --> 37:17.240
You see, er, I'm

37:17.240 --> 37:19.800
supposed to act like I've got all
the answers.

37:19.800 --> 37:22.720
On the inside I feel
more like a kid, scared of

37:22.720 --> 37:24.560
dropping the ball,

37:24.560 --> 37:28.560
making the wrong decision.

37:29.160 --> 37:32.920
Well, I have some of those
same fears about myself.

37:32.920 --> 37:35.240
          Everybody does.

37:35.240 --> 37:37.400
You don't know
the people I work with.

37:37.400 --> 37:41.360
Bright, together, tough, I'm

37:41.360 --> 37:43.320
just not like them.

37:43.320 --> 37:46.160
        What are you like?

37:46.160 --> 37:47.800
Nice guy,

37:47.800 --> 37:50.000
compassionate, caring,

37:50.000 --> 37:53.440
I know, because when others hurt,
so do I.

37:53.440 --> 37:57.440
Tonight someone needed me and I
never gave up, and after I helped,

37:58.560 --> 38:02.040
I didn't feel any better.

38:02.040 --> 38:06.040
It sounds to me like you're
asking too much of yourself, Don.

38:07.040 --> 38:10.200
         Just be yourself,

38:10.200 --> 38:14.200
do the best you can do, nobody
can ask for any more than that.

38:16.320 --> 38:16.640
               Don?

38:16.640 --> 38:19.360
               Don?
You make a lot of sense.

38:19.360 --> 38:21.520
         I've been there.

38:21.520 --> 38:25.520
Thanks for listening.

39:03.440 --> 39:07.360
           Good morning.

39:07.360 --> 39:09.440
     Let me get that for you.

39:09.440 --> 39:13.440
Thanks.

39:19.880 --> 39:22.000
Doctor Auschlander.

39:22.000 --> 39:25.680
I gave you...The Womb.

39:25.680 --> 39:28.280
A protective receptacle for

39:28.280 --> 39:32.040
the regeneration of the species -
may all who enter here feel safe.

39:32.040 --> 39:36.040
    Mr Corey, we need to talk.

39:47.480 --> 39:50.200
So that's what it looks like!

39:50.200 --> 39:54.200
    Dr Corny, Dr Corny, 4721...

39:57.720 --> 40:01.720
              Victor?

40:08.600 --> 40:12.600
              Victor!

40:26.160 --> 40:29.720
Ehrlich!
Get off me!

40:29.720 --> 40:33.720
I put my soul into every fold of
cloth, every molecule of paint.

40:34.520 --> 40:38.440
Your womb is both a
hazard and a hindrance.

40:38.440 --> 40:42.280
Now, while the sentiment
is well-intentioned, it's...

40:42.280 --> 40:44.400
impractical, and it must
be dismantled, I'm sorry.

40:44.400 --> 40:48.080
No, no, no. I'm the one who's sorry
for trying to enlighten a bunch of

40:48.080 --> 40:49.840
 over-educated, self-important...

40:49.840 --> 40:52.200
Now, now, Mr Corey. I don't
want to get into hurling insults.

40:52.200 --> 40:55.800
   This hospital is a dung heap.

40:55.800 --> 40:58.440
On the other hand I rather enjoy
hurling a good insult now and then.

40:58.440 --> 41:02.440
Do you know this original
Corey is now worth six figures?

41:03.600 --> 41:06.560
My work deserves to be enjoyed by
great minds, and since there are

41:06.560 --> 41:10.560
        none around here...

41:11.080 --> 41:15.080
..you can tell the Arts Council, I
will be returning their grant money.

41:27.200 --> 41:28.680
           Good morning.

41:28.680 --> 41:29.760
Morning!

41:29.760 --> 41:31.360
Listen, about dinner last night...

41:31.360 --> 41:32.840
Sorry, I wasn't much help.

41:32.840 --> 41:35.000
No, that stir fry stuff was terrific.

41:35.000 --> 41:36.240
No, with Lizzie.

41:36.240 --> 41:39.560
Yeah, I've decided to let her stay.

41:39.560 --> 41:43.560
Oh, congratulations.

41:43.640 --> 41:46.720
Can you, er,
pass with sugar on the next table?

41:46.720 --> 41:47.240
Thanks.

41:47.240 --> 41:49.480
Thanks.
It's like a
great weight has been lifted.

41:49.480 --> 41:51.400
Yes, well, veggies can do that.

41:51.400 --> 41:54.720
You know, for the last
six months I've...

41:54.720 --> 41:57.280
Six months, hell, the
last 10 years, I've been

41:57.280 --> 42:00.000
 trying to be more than who I am,

42:00.000 --> 42:02.920
you know? Punishing myself for
my flaws, expecting perfection

42:02.920 --> 42:05.120
       from everybody else,

42:05.120 --> 42:07.600
which of course made me as
narrow and condescending as...

42:07.600 --> 42:08.960
Dr Craig.

42:08.960 --> 42:10.440
Dr Craig.
               Yeah!

42:10.440 --> 42:11.800
    But without the punchline!

42:11.800 --> 42:15.800
Yeah! I came back to St Eligius
thinking I knew it all.

42:19.360 --> 42:23.200
But because of you I realised how
little I do know. You take on the

42:23.200 --> 42:25.680
burdens of the world, Donald,
you have time for everyone.

42:25.680 --> 42:29.120
Except yourself.

42:29.120 --> 42:32.160
Yeah, well, I'm afraid that's
not gonna change.

42:32.160 --> 42:34.840
Maybe.

42:34.840 --> 42:35.960
              Thanks.

42:35.960 --> 42:39.120
For what?

42:39.120 --> 42:41.200
    Well, just having you back.

42:41.200 --> 42:45.200
Oh...

42:50.080 --> 42:54.080
I think I'm falling
in love with you, lady.

42:57.440 --> 43:01.440
          See you later.

43:08.560 --> 43:11.440
So that's St Eligius' first
sculpture?

43:11.440 --> 43:15.200
Actually, Mr Corey's work was quite
a bit more, beautiful and simple, as

43:15.200 --> 43:18.000
all great swindles are.
But it had to go.

43:18.000 --> 43:20.080
So do I.
Good night, Daniel, or good morning.

43:20.080 --> 43:23.120
I never know what to call
it when I work graveyard.

43:23.120 --> 43:26.840
Â¤50,000 for a Â¤20 piece of
pipe, nice going, Daniel.

43:26.840 --> 43:27.880
      Where are you heading?

43:27.880 --> 43:30.520
I'm hurrying home to Ellen with
these flowers, then back here for

43:30.520 --> 43:31.520
Mrs Litton's bypass.

43:31.520 --> 43:35.520
I sure hope the state police aren't
running radar on the Fitzgeralds.

43:36.080 --> 43:39.800
Sometimes you stay up all night
working and it doesn't pay off.

43:39.800 --> 43:43.800
Well, you did get time and a half.

43:56.920 --> 44:00.920
PHONE RINGS

44:10.000 --> 44:11.720
       Crisis Intervention.

44:11.720 --> 44:12.000
Phil?

44:12.000 --> 44:13.440
Phil?
               Amy?

44:13.440 --> 44:17.440
I thought about what you said,
how today would be a brand new day,

44:18.320 --> 44:22.200
things would all look better.

44:22.200 --> 44:24.880
     And they do, don't they?

44:24.880 --> 44:26.480
I mean, the sun is shining,
the birds are singing.

44:26.480 --> 44:28.360
You sound terrible.

44:28.360 --> 44:30.240
                Oh!

44:30.240 --> 44:33.160
      I've been up all night.

44:33.160 --> 44:35.680
Sorry I put you through all this.

44:35.680 --> 44:38.840
No, listen, listen, Amy, it
was well worth the wait, just

44:38.840 --> 44:41.960
     to hear your voice again.

44:41.960 --> 44:45.680
Thank you, Phil, I really
appreciate your caring.

44:45.680 --> 44:48.760
          Amy, listen...

44:48.760 --> 44:52.760
You should think about
seeing a counsellor.

44:53.320 --> 44:57.320
Just to talk, just to sort
out some of your feelings.

44:58.360 --> 45:02.360
I don't need to.
I understand what I have to do now.

45:04.880 --> 45:06.760
GUNSHOT

45:06.760 --> 45:10.760
                No!

45:16.200 --> 45:20.200
               God!

45:31.120 --> 45:51.000
