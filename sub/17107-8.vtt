00:02.359 --> 00:03.799
NARRATOR: Previously
on Dance Academy--

00:03.839 --> 00:04.879
-I wrapped you two hours ago.

00:04.919 --> 00:05.879
You're not getting overtime
for this.

00:05.919 --> 00:08.439
-I have to dance and
act tomorrow.

00:08.480 --> 00:10.679
Be really bad for my self-esteem
if I sucked at

00:10.720 --> 00:11.960
both.

00:12.000 --> 00:12.839
-Ms. Raymond will meet your
bus this afternoon.

00:12.880 --> 00:14.439
-You're actually sending
me home?

00:14.480 --> 00:16.679
-Two years ago in audition week,
you should have taken

00:16.719 --> 00:19.039
one look at my body type and
known I didn't stand a chance

00:19.079 --> 00:20.079
with the company.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.519
-You pushed me to this.

00:21.559 --> 00:24.640
I choreographed this all for you
and will accept no other.

00:24.679 --> 00:25.480
[speaking foreign language]

00:25.519 --> 00:27.399
-Please go home.

00:27.440 --> 00:29.160
Barcelona was fake.

00:29.199 --> 00:30.600
I wasn't being me.

00:30.640 --> 00:32.439
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): So you
and Ben, that's actually a

00:32.479 --> 00:33.799
thing is it?

00:33.840 --> 00:36.320
-I didn't mean it before about
us not being friends.

00:36.359 --> 00:37.200
-That's OK.

00:37.240 --> 00:38.079
Romeo and Juliet weren't
friends.

00:41.520 --> 00:43.479
[theme music]

01:26.439 --> 01:31.799
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
[ceremonial singing]

01:31.840 --> 01:34.480
NARRATOR: The traditional owners
here say that in the

01:34.519 --> 01:37.159
beginning, there was a
connection between our human

01:37.200 --> 01:38.560
spirits and the land.

01:38.599 --> 01:42.760
But over time, that was tainted,
so they created a

01:42.799 --> 01:44.159
cleansing ritual.

01:48.400 --> 01:52.599
Whenever you're welcomed into
a special place, you're to

01:52.640 --> 01:54.120
leave the bad spirits behind.

01:59.280 --> 02:02.319
I guess it's a way of shedding
the things that hold us back,

02:02.359 --> 02:03.799
our baggage.

02:03.840 --> 02:07.640
I know I've got several extra
suitcases full of clothes I

02:07.680 --> 02:11.520
loved once but have
now outgrown.

02:11.560 --> 02:13.680
And yet for some reason, I keep
putting off that epic

02:13.719 --> 02:18.400
clean out, even though I'll feel
so much better for it.

02:18.439 --> 02:21.479
I mean, who doesn't like the
idea of traveling light?

02:21.520 --> 02:23.800
-Her back is not up
to both leads.

02:23.840 --> 02:27.199
Her solo's being butchered
out there.

02:27.240 --> 02:30.520
-She only has to get through
one more after this.

02:30.560 --> 02:33.840
-Yeah, the final all-important
performance.

02:33.879 --> 02:35.199
I'd do it better.

02:36.840 --> 02:39.039
-Shame you never auditioned.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.719
Don't miss your cue.

02:57.120 --> 02:59.560
-Did you wear these shoes,
Auntie Summer?

02:59.599 --> 03:01.120
-I did.

03:01.159 --> 03:05.240
I even danced Juliet
once with Zach.

03:05.280 --> 03:08.400
-Everyone gather
around, please.

03:08.439 --> 03:09.599
This is Summer.

03:09.639 --> 03:10.759
We used to dance together.

03:10.800 --> 03:12.599
And Summer has invited
us to a traditional

03:12.639 --> 03:13.800
welcome ceremony tomorrow.

03:13.840 --> 03:15.759
So I'm extending the
tour by one day.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.400
-Hands up-- who wants a dance
lesson from the academy mob

03:18.439 --> 03:18.800
tomorrow?

03:18.840 --> 03:19.560
-Me.

03:19.599 --> 03:20.120
-I do.

03:20.159 --> 03:22.039
-Yeah.

03:22.080 --> 03:23.400
-Teaching--

03:23.439 --> 03:24.599
can't wait.

03:35.719 --> 03:37.719
-Four weeks of 12 hour days?

03:37.759 --> 03:39.159
You have a right to
be knackered.

03:39.199 --> 03:41.800
-Well, it's no excuse for me to
be thumping around like a

03:41.840 --> 03:42.479
baby elephant.

03:42.520 --> 03:43.599
-Oh, I love dancers--

03:43.639 --> 03:44.800
so self-critical.

03:44.840 --> 03:48.680
-Doubles, Grace-- your
laziness astounds me.

03:48.719 --> 03:50.680
-No idea why.

03:50.719 --> 03:54.080
-And Ben, good performance--
technically strong as always.

03:54.120 --> 03:55.319
But--

03:55.360 --> 03:56.800
-Looks like Romeo's in the
bag for the Benster.

03:56.840 --> 03:57.639
-As for who's playing Romeo in
the festival performance, I

03:57.680 --> 03:59.159
haven't decided.

03:59.199 --> 04:00.680
Christian's been giving you a
run for your money every other

04:00.719 --> 04:01.840
night.

04:01.879 --> 04:03.039
-It's because my Romeo's
dashing and intense.

04:03.080 --> 04:05.159
-Do you mean you weren't feeling
the romance, the

04:05.199 --> 04:06.520
heartbreak, when they died?

04:06.560 --> 04:09.199
-More affection and mild
sadness-- you two still aren't

04:09.240 --> 04:10.520
nailing their chemistry.

04:10.560 --> 04:13.439
-Oh, like the way she nails
it with Christian, sir?

04:13.479 --> 04:14.639
FEMALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Oh, the subtext there.

04:33.639 --> 04:37.240
-Spread thy close curtain,
love-performing night.

04:37.279 --> 04:39.199
See? the chemistry crackles.

04:39.240 --> 04:42.439
-Maybe we should work on Zach's
nights when it's sunny.

04:42.480 --> 04:44.199
-Do you ever worry
we've stalled?

04:44.240 --> 04:45.680
-Hey, can I just--

04:45.720 --> 04:48.079
-Romeo and Juliet knew each
other like two days, and they

04:48.120 --> 04:50.199
got married.

04:50.240 --> 04:51.680
-What, you want to
get married?

04:51.720 --> 05:01.160
-No, but they couldn't wait to
do like everything together.

05:01.199 --> 05:02.399
-Everything?

05:06.120 --> 05:10.639
Oh, everything everything?

05:10.680 --> 05:11.639
-You've never thought
about it?

05:11.680 --> 05:13.480
-All the time.

05:13.519 --> 05:18.279
I mean, sometimes, yeah.

05:18.319 --> 05:19.480
-Really, with me?

05:19.519 --> 05:21.120
-Of course.

05:21.160 --> 05:23.519
Well, sometimes Rhianna
gets in there.

05:23.560 --> 05:28.199
Wait, you want to
do it like now?

05:28.240 --> 05:34.199
-Not right this minute, but it's
what people do, I mean

05:34.240 --> 05:37.600
like a lot of people,
like parents.

05:37.639 --> 05:42.399
So it's not out of the
question for us to--

05:45.120 --> 05:47.800
even soon.

05:47.839 --> 05:49.160
-Soon.

06:43.360 --> 06:44.800
-Ah, that was pretty close--

06:44.839 --> 06:48.600
a couple of phrasing issues,
but, ah, for a first attempt--

06:48.639 --> 06:49.759
-I'll fix them.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.759
Will I have the solo or not?

06:51.800 --> 06:53.480
-Well, It's a pretty
big decision.

06:53.519 --> 06:56.040
Sir Geoffrey's considering me
for a choreography resident,

06:56.079 --> 06:57.600
so it's kind of my audition.

06:57.639 --> 07:00.160
-You want a job with
the company.

07:00.199 --> 07:02.399
Maybe that's not because--

07:02.439 --> 07:04.120
I'm only here because I want to
show him that he was wrong

07:04.160 --> 07:04.879
to rule me out.

07:04.920 --> 07:06.720
It's not personal with us.

07:06.759 --> 07:09.279
-I wouldn't assume it was.

07:09.319 --> 07:12.800
Anyway, um, the solo is
personal, so what was in your

07:12.839 --> 07:15.399
head before the jetes?

07:15.439 --> 07:19.639
-My head, let's see,
uh, is my left

07:19.680 --> 07:22.199
developpe higher than Taras?

07:22.240 --> 07:24.399
There are ants circling my
ankles, because you seem to

07:24.439 --> 07:28.519
think this is more inspiring
than the sprung floor.

07:28.560 --> 07:31.600
Mm, does that help your
emotional creative process?

07:31.639 --> 07:36.439
-No, I'll need you
to dig deeper.

07:36.480 --> 07:37.639
-That's really all there is.

07:46.800 --> 07:50.279
-Benster, whatcha doing there?

07:50.319 --> 07:54.240
-Oh, just, um, picked
up some supplies.

07:54.279 --> 07:57.279
-Lip balm, sunscreen--

07:57.319 --> 08:00.319
wow, a whole basket
of protection.

08:00.360 --> 08:03.800
-Yeah, you know, the
mountain air--

08:03.839 --> 08:05.199
can't be too careful.

08:14.079 --> 08:15.680
-Oh, yesterday my little
T was practically

08:15.720 --> 08:17.600
smashing a bear, and now--

08:17.639 --> 08:21.160
-I know, it was like an out
of body experience.

08:21.199 --> 08:23.160
Couldn't believe I was even
suggesting it, but it's-- it's

08:23.199 --> 08:25.600
Ben, and we work so
well together.

08:25.639 --> 08:28.399
The problem is my brain
is clogged with

08:28.439 --> 08:29.839
trashy magazine advice.

08:29.879 --> 08:31.759
I need an honest behind
the scenes.

08:31.800 --> 08:33.799
-And I can provide that how?

08:33.840 --> 08:35.679
-It's OK, I can handle it.

08:35.720 --> 08:38.159
You and Christian, talk me
through first positions.

08:38.200 --> 08:40.320
-T, no, no, we never.

08:40.360 --> 08:42.159
-I always thought that you--

08:42.200 --> 08:43.440
-I would've told you.

08:43.480 --> 08:47.360
It's just too much baggage
and bad timing and--

08:47.399 --> 08:48.879
MALE SPEAKER (IN EARPIECE):
30 seconds, mate.

08:48.919 --> 08:50.279
-Well, pretty much everything
that goes under, he's just not

08:50.320 --> 08:51.080
that into you.

08:51.120 --> 08:51.840
-We've got about 20 seconds.

08:51.879 --> 08:54.240
-Am I on speaker?

08:54.279 --> 08:56.200
-Tara, I've heard so
much about you.

08:56.240 --> 08:57.519
Make sure you're doing it
for the right reasons.

08:57.559 --> 09:00.720
Remember, guys can get hurt
just as easily as girls.

09:00.759 --> 09:02.600
We need to go.

09:02.639 --> 09:04.679
-All right dance teachers,
we're traveling.

09:04.720 --> 09:07.440
Bush, tackle forages, you
wait here for Summer.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.679
-Um, Zach, Ben and I were
wondering if we could grab

09:10.720 --> 09:11.480
some rehearsal time--

09:11.519 --> 09:12.480
-But I wanted to hear--

09:12.519 --> 09:18.080
---to work on our chemistry
issues.

09:18.120 --> 09:19.279
-Fine.

09:24.840 --> 09:29.559
-I am all over your
back story, Jamie.

09:29.600 --> 09:32.600
Some cruel temptress has
hardened your heart.

09:32.639 --> 09:33.720
-Cruel I can handle.

09:33.759 --> 09:34.919
It's much worse when they're
spectacular.

09:34.960 --> 09:38.600
-Kitty Kat, I've got two
soothing words for you--

09:38.639 --> 09:39.799
dance double.

09:39.840 --> 09:41.200
-I'm ready for my close-up.

09:44.559 --> 09:50.440
-I haven't even gone through
the five basic positions.

09:50.480 --> 09:52.519
-OK guys, have fun.

09:52.559 --> 09:54.679
When I get back, I want our
hosts pirouetting like

09:54.720 --> 09:55.840
Baryshnikov.

09:55.879 --> 09:58.759
-OK, now assuming you're
interested in proper

09:58.799 --> 09:59.759
technique, we're going to--

09:59.799 --> 10:01.360
-Which they're not--

10:01.399 --> 10:03.399
all right guys, in a couple of
weeks, Christian and I are

10:03.440 --> 10:04.639
entering a crew into
the biggest

10:04.679 --> 10:06.200
hip hop comp in Sydney.

10:06.240 --> 10:07.600
Who wants to learn some
of our moves.

10:07.639 --> 10:08.639
-Oh yeah, me.

10:08.679 --> 10:10.320
-Yeah, all right, come
on, let's go.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.200
-Do you prefer the left side
or the right side?

10:20.240 --> 10:21.159
-I have to pick a side?

10:21.200 --> 10:22.519
-No, no, this is--
this is fine.

10:22.559 --> 10:24.559
Come sit closer.

10:24.600 --> 10:25.440
-Um, what?

10:25.480 --> 10:26.360
-Yeah, that was creepy.

10:26.399 --> 10:27.039
I'm sorry.

10:27.080 --> 10:28.720
-No, it was cute.

10:28.759 --> 10:30.759
You look pretty.

10:30.799 --> 10:32.159
Here, I'll--

10:37.600 --> 10:40.600
ah, my mom's always had
this thing about

10:40.639 --> 10:41.879
sitting on the bedspread.

10:41.919 --> 10:45.480
Apparently, motels only wash
it every six months.

10:45.519 --> 10:46.080
-Are you serious?

10:46.120 --> 10:47.320
That's disgusting.

10:47.360 --> 10:48.080
-I know--

10:48.120 --> 10:49.240
Benster to the rescue.

10:51.360 --> 10:55.320
-It's like, how many people do
you think have used this room?

10:55.360 --> 10:57.120
-Let's pretend we're
the first--

10:57.159 --> 10:58.320
positive visualization.

11:07.519 --> 11:08.840
-House keeping--

11:08.879 --> 11:10.240
sorry, do you want
me to come back?

11:10.279 --> 11:11.399
-Yes please.

11:11.440 --> 11:12.600
-No, come in.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.720
-So who thinks they
can match that?

11:27.320 --> 11:28.200
Come on, don't be scared.

11:28.240 --> 11:29.399
Have a crack.

11:34.320 --> 11:37.639
-Ollie, you gotta break it
down for them, dude.

11:37.679 --> 11:39.120
-OK, watch again--

11:39.159 --> 11:40.320
music.

11:54.440 --> 11:56.399
-You go back.

11:56.440 --> 12:00.159
Turn out, turn out-- you're
very short, aren't you?

12:00.200 --> 12:01.360
-She's four.

12:14.080 --> 12:15.799
-I think I'm starting to get
this whole ballet thing.

12:20.720 --> 12:21.679
-Cut.

12:21.720 --> 12:23.320
-If you say so.

12:23.360 --> 12:24.600
-Sorry, Gabs.

12:24.639 --> 12:29.320
I just feel like she's dancing
Tamsin too brassy.

12:29.360 --> 12:32.559
-But isn't this a high point,
Tamsin realizing she's

12:32.600 --> 12:33.600
in love with Paul?

12:33.639 --> 12:36.320
-Yes, but Paul's into
her boyfriend.

12:36.360 --> 12:39.399
So it's emotionally
complicated.

12:39.440 --> 12:43.200
I just feel like Tamsin is--

12:43.240 --> 12:44.440
-Insecure?

12:55.399 --> 12:56.600
-So what's the hot
new game these

12:56.639 --> 12:59.279
days, Disgruntled Pigeons?

12:59.320 --> 13:02.840
-It's Empire Crew.

13:02.879 --> 13:05.320
-We're going up against
them at, um--

13:05.360 --> 13:07.080
-Street Beats?

13:07.120 --> 13:08.679
You're mate said.

13:08.720 --> 13:11.240
-Yeah, you know Street Beats?

13:11.279 --> 13:12.799
-You'll never beat them.

13:12.840 --> 13:13.720
-I don't know--

13:13.759 --> 13:16.799
Ollie's pretty good.

13:16.840 --> 13:18.559
-He thinks he is.

13:18.600 --> 13:21.399
-You cast me because
I'm a dancer.

13:21.440 --> 13:23.519
It's not going to look real if
it's someone else that's the

13:23.559 --> 13:24.279
other half.

13:24.320 --> 13:25.480
-It's movie magic, Kat.

13:25.519 --> 13:26.799
Just come to the assembly
screening tonight.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.799
You'll see how real
it looks, OK?

13:28.840 --> 13:31.679
We're going for a
take, everybody.

13:31.720 --> 13:32.639
-Bye, Mary.

13:32.679 --> 13:33.720
Good luck with the
netball comp.

13:33.759 --> 13:35.120
-Oh, thanks, Ben.

13:39.440 --> 13:40.480
-Are we--

13:40.519 --> 13:41.799
we changing location, or?

13:41.840 --> 13:43.399
-Don't you think the
moment's been lost?

13:43.440 --> 13:44.120
-No way.

13:44.159 --> 13:45.799
We'll find it again.

13:45.840 --> 13:48.159
Finding moments is a hidden
talent of mine.

13:48.200 --> 13:51.200
Here moment, where
are you, moment?

13:51.240 --> 13:53.639
-I'm sorry, Mary's disinfectant
is overpowering.

13:53.679 --> 13:54.480
I'll, ah--

13:54.519 --> 13:55.519
I'll wait for you outside.

14:00.360 --> 14:02.360
-Hey, I think you deserve
a break, man.

14:02.399 --> 14:03.480
-No, I'm good.

14:03.519 --> 14:06.039
-No, take one anyway.

14:06.080 --> 14:08.320
All right, guys, rows of three,
and we're just going to

14:08.360 --> 14:09.840
learn a quick routine, OK?

14:09.879 --> 14:14.639
Bounce up, bounce up,
step to the right,

14:14.679 --> 14:17.600
step, pop, step, pop.

14:17.639 --> 14:19.639
From here, tight right
to the left--

14:19.679 --> 14:23.159
one, left, right.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.639
OK, want to try with
the music?

14:24.679 --> 14:25.799
Ready--

14:30.360 --> 14:33.080
five, six, five, six,
seven, eight.

14:38.519 --> 14:41.840
-Up, up, Tildy, this
is a shambles.

14:41.879 --> 14:43.440
What happened to your turnout?

14:43.480 --> 14:44.639
Turn out--

14:49.440 --> 14:54.399
up, and up, up.

14:54.440 --> 14:56.759
-Poor choice of lip balm?

14:56.799 --> 14:59.799
-You don't know how
lucky you are.

14:59.840 --> 15:02.360
Gail's brains-- it's a
labyrinth in there.

15:09.759 --> 15:15.279
-Up, up, up, up, up--

15:15.320 --> 15:16.480
can you straighten your leg?

15:19.879 --> 15:21.200
Are you going to cry?

15:21.240 --> 15:22.840
Because if you're going to stand
here in my classroom and

15:22.879 --> 15:24.200
cry, you can get out.

15:24.240 --> 15:25.440
-Abigail--

15:29.360 --> 15:30.480
hey there, little lady.

15:30.519 --> 15:32.639
Want to go and find the
bubblers, yeah?

15:39.559 --> 15:41.120
-Yeah, now freestyle--

15:46.840 --> 15:49.399
woo, oh.

15:49.440 --> 15:50.600
-Yeah.

15:54.360 --> 15:57.360
-Plie, tendu, and close--

15:57.399 --> 15:59.200
tendu, plie--

15:59.240 --> 16:00.600
good girls.

16:00.639 --> 16:03.559
Really stretch through
those legs.

16:03.600 --> 16:06.720
-Hey, who taught
you that stuff?

16:06.759 --> 16:08.519
-No one, just from
clips online.

16:08.559 --> 16:10.759
-Well, you should come down to
Sydney for Street Beats.

16:10.799 --> 16:11.519
No, I'm serious.

16:11.559 --> 16:14.320
You should join our crew.

16:14.360 --> 16:17.120
-No, my grandma needs help
with my sisters.

16:17.159 --> 16:20.799
-All right well, you know, just
keep dancing, all right?

16:20.840 --> 16:22.120
You're good, man.

16:22.159 --> 16:23.399
-I gotta go--

16:23.440 --> 16:25.480
Summer needs us.

16:25.519 --> 16:27.799
-Be back in a sec, guys.

16:34.279 --> 16:37.080
-I just went all
Zach, didn't I?

16:37.120 --> 16:38.120
-You're good at this--

16:38.159 --> 16:39.200
teaching.

16:39.240 --> 16:40.399
Kids like you.

16:42.799 --> 16:45.799
-How was rehearsal?

16:45.840 --> 16:49.639
-I should go find Ben.

16:49.679 --> 16:50.919
-Good work, everyone.

16:50.960 --> 16:52.799
We're going to follow Summer
to the ceremony now.

17:02.360 --> 17:05.319
-So, they're talking about
re-shooting most

17:05.358 --> 17:06.839
of the dance scenes.

17:06.880 --> 17:10.640
I really want to help shape
Tamsin into something special.

17:10.680 --> 17:13.079
And when you think about it, you
and I have heaps in common

17:13.118 --> 17:15.079
we can draw on.

17:15.118 --> 17:18.480
-We have nothing in common.

17:18.519 --> 17:19.720
-Seriously?

17:19.759 --> 17:22.598
There's a reason I'm
the perfect double.

17:22.640 --> 17:25.440
Erratic international
upbringing, absent parents,

17:25.480 --> 17:28.640
general maverick attitude to--

17:28.680 --> 17:32.519
you don't think this will make
us look puffy on camera?

17:32.559 --> 17:36.799
-Grace, you're the pre-champion,
a shoe-in with

17:36.839 --> 17:38.119
the company.

17:38.160 --> 17:40.640
Why do you have to take this
one thing away from me?

17:40.680 --> 17:42.759
-This one thing--

17:42.799 --> 17:45.200
no one even cares I got
sent home from tour.

17:45.240 --> 17:49.160
And you just sail through
everything shining.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.680
The whole world loves Kat.

17:56.240 --> 17:58.200
-How awkward was that before?

17:58.240 --> 18:02.200
This is something that requires
proper discussion.

18:02.240 --> 18:07.319
We can't just leapfrog all the
steps to what-- prove a point?

18:07.359 --> 18:09.079
-I don't need to
prove anything.

18:09.119 --> 18:11.279
I know I love you.

18:11.319 --> 18:13.720
And then, you say--

18:13.759 --> 18:14.680
-We've never talked
about that.

18:14.720 --> 18:16.319
-Well, let's give it a go.

18:16.359 --> 18:18.440
Because I want to be the
permanent text on your life,

18:18.480 --> 18:19.319
not Christian.

18:19.359 --> 18:20.799
-Where did you hear that?

18:20.839 --> 18:21.640
-I read it.

18:21.680 --> 18:23.160
Oh, but you should write more.

18:23.200 --> 18:25.400
It was gripping and detailed.

18:25.440 --> 18:26.480
-You read my journal?

18:26.519 --> 18:28.559
-Oh, pages and pages
about you and him.

18:28.599 --> 18:31.400
-That's just me taking life
experiences and then-- and

18:31.440 --> 18:32.799
then using them to
inspire dancing.

18:32.839 --> 18:34.759
It's hindsight, and
it's private.

18:34.799 --> 18:36.319
-And given the number
times I found the

18:36.359 --> 18:38.200
words Ben or Benster--

18:38.240 --> 18:40.640
I'm clearly not a very
inspirational figure.

18:40.680 --> 18:42.480
-You have no reason
not to trust me.

18:53.279 --> 18:55.279
-Not my greatest moment.

18:55.319 --> 18:59.599
-Hmm, trying to save her from
a life of heartbreak?

18:59.640 --> 19:02.519
What, you hate ballet
that much?

19:02.559 --> 19:08.039
-No, that's not what's
in my head.

19:08.079 --> 19:12.079
Since they told me that I never
even had a chance of

19:12.119 --> 19:19.240
getting a contract, I think
I've known that it's time.

19:19.279 --> 19:21.480
If that's all that had happened,
then maybe I could

19:21.519 --> 19:23.279
keep struggling for a
couple more years.

19:26.319 --> 19:27.480
-You lost someone.

19:31.880 --> 19:34.359
-Does that mean--

19:34.400 --> 19:35.720
does that mean I--

19:35.759 --> 19:37.079
I'm not stupid.

19:37.119 --> 19:40.519
I know we probably wouldn't have
ended up together, but I

19:40.559 --> 19:43.480
loved him like I love ballet,
and they both

19:43.519 --> 19:44.680
just smashed me apart.

19:47.440 --> 19:50.799
I can't go through that again.

19:50.839 --> 19:52.160
I'm sorry.

-Now I'd like to ask all our
visitors to walk through the

20:29.359 --> 20:30.640

21:23.559 --> 21:24.720
-Perfect natural.

21:27.400 --> 21:30.359
-I'm not that together.

21:30.400 --> 21:32.839
Next year, all my friends will
either be overseas of in the

21:32.880 --> 21:37.200
company, and I'll be lonely.

21:37.240 --> 21:38.400
-Lonely sucks.

22:15.599 --> 22:17.519
NARRATOR: I'm going to give up
the idea of traveling light is

22:17.559 --> 22:20.160
an impossible concept.

22:20.200 --> 22:21.680
It's cumulative.

22:21.720 --> 22:25.559
Every experience we have, every
person we meet, they

22:25.599 --> 22:28.599
make up the story of
you like a journal.

22:28.640 --> 22:29.799
-Saying goodbye?

22:31.839 --> 22:33.799
-That was the plan.

22:46.640 --> 22:48.160
NARRATOR: I guess it's only when
you go to throw something

22:48.200 --> 22:50.799
out you realize how
essential it is.

TARA (VOICEMAIL):
Hey, it's Tara.

23:05.880 --> 23:07.200
Sorry I can't get to you.

23:07.240 --> 23:09.200
-I did bad, and I get it.

23:09.240 --> 23:11.680
But you have to come see this.

23:11.720 --> 23:14.279
It's like you in a place.

23:14.319 --> 23:15.480
It's-- it's beautiful.

23:21.200 --> 23:23.680
NARRATOR: Like it or not, there
are some things that--

23:23.720 --> 23:24.839
[knocking]

23:24.880 --> 23:28.240
NARRATOR: --are permanently
inscribed that

23:28.279 --> 23:29.440
you're stuck with.

23:31.680 --> 23:33.559
-Can I talk to you later?

23:33.599 --> 23:34.599
Go away, Christian.

23:34.640 --> 23:35.599
-Wait, what happened?

23:35.640 --> 23:38.440
You OK?

23:38.480 --> 23:41.759
-No, I'm just sick of it.

23:41.799 --> 23:45.240
I keep thinking, when is
this going to stop?

23:45.279 --> 23:48.200
Because I want so much
to be rid of you.

23:48.240 --> 23:50.279
It's all I could think about
during that ceremony.

23:52.880 --> 23:54.240
-Did it work?
