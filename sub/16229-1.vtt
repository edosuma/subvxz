WEBVTT

01:40.976 --> 01:43.519
I remember looking out at the two of you.

01:43.604 --> 01:46.355
Her playing on the dock, you watching.

01:52.404 --> 01:57.825
I was thinking how lucky you were
to have a mom like her,

02:02.706 --> 02:05.625
and how lucky she was
to have a boy like you.

02:14.426 --> 02:16.719
That's what he stole from you, Simon.

02:19.723 --> 02:21.724
That's what I can never forgive.

02:24.770 --> 02:26.854
The thing you have to remember
about my mother

02:26.939 --> 02:29.273
was that she was extremely trusting.

02:31.568 --> 02:35.112
It's the only way she could have
found herself in that situation.

02:37.115 --> 02:39.158
And that was the first thing

02:39.243 --> 02:42.078
that must have been obvious
to the security agents.

02:44.289 --> 02:46.123
She was completely innocent.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.842
-You speak Hebrew?
-No.

02:57.970 --> 02:59.929
You'll be staying in Tel Aviv?

03:00.764 --> 03:02.682
We're going to the Holy Land.

03:02.933 --> 03:04.183
Who's "we"?

03:04.935 --> 03:06.727
My fiancÃ© and I.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.564
Why isn't he traveling with you?

03:10.566 --> 03:12.942
He had to stay for business.

03:13.068 --> 03:15.027
You're pregnant?

03:18.282 --> 03:21.284
People always ask
how two kids could be so different.

03:25.956 --> 03:29.166
Your mother showed her talent
from the time she could walk,

03:32.796 --> 03:34.255
even before.

03:35.966 --> 03:40.094
She was always singing to herself,
around the house, in the yard.

03:41.763 --> 03:46.142
When she picked up a violin, it was like
she already knew where to put her fingers.

03:57.821 --> 04:02.658
Your uncle, on the other hand,
never figured out what his talent was,

04:04.369 --> 04:06.203
except trouble and mischief.

04:41.281 --> 04:44.784
My parents said the most ridiculous thing.
But, like, you never have proof,

04:44.868 --> 04:46.077
and you just want some sort of proof.

04:46.161 --> 04:47.453
That's exactly what it was like, you know.

04:47.537 --> 04:50.414
And then it just turned out to be
really funny, so I wanted to show you guys.

04:50.499 --> 04:53.292
I mean, he thought that his life is, like,
really dramatic...

04:53.377 --> 04:55.962
I thought you were on crack
when you showed us that.

04:56.046 --> 04:59.590
It's, like, why would you
waste your time videotaping...

04:59.675 --> 05:00.800
Simon, you want to get that?

05:00.884 --> 05:02.426
Why would Simon...

05:10.978 --> 05:14.855
-Hi.
-That'll be $24.

05:16.024 --> 05:19.694
Well, can't you just put it on the tab
like you usually do?

05:20.946 --> 05:22.571
Sorry. Not anymore.

05:24.074 --> 05:27.910
-Is it less spicy than usual?
-Why didn't he want to put it on the tab?

05:30.580 --> 05:34.041
-Go figure.
-That's what I'm trying to do.

05:34.584 --> 05:35.751
Well, don't.

05:42.551 --> 05:44.260
Check the green one there.

05:45.429 --> 05:49.181
See if it's dead. Good.

05:52.394 --> 05:55.438
You know, if we're having problems,
you should let me know.

05:55.522 --> 05:58.691
-Who said anything about having problems?
-With money.

05:58.775 --> 06:03.195
With money?
What are you going to do about it?

06:03.280 --> 06:05.072
-Help.
-How are you gonna help?

06:05.157 --> 06:07.575
Are you gonna sell your old video games?

06:09.453 --> 06:12.288
You know, I could get a loan or something.

06:18.253 --> 06:24.050
Innocence is a hard thing to describe.
It's like a scent,

06:24.134 --> 06:26.177
a thing which some people carry.

06:27.179 --> 06:28.888
And from the moment they found the bomb,

06:28.972 --> 06:32.725
the security officials knew
that my mother had nothing to do with it.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.769
My father was the wanted man.

06:36.354 --> 06:40.316
And when I heard the story
in the classroom last week,

06:40.400 --> 06:43.652
read to us in French, it all came back.

06:44.488 --> 06:48.282
I was raised to hate my father
for what he did to our family.

06:48.366 --> 06:49.742
He was a monster.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.953
But who exactly was this monster?

06:54.706 --> 06:56.540
What would make him do that?

06:57.250 --> 06:59.668
You have anybody meeting you in Tel Aviv?

06:59.753 --> 07:01.796
Yes. His family.

07:01.922 --> 07:04.924
-Whose family?
-My fiancÃ©'s.

07:05.008 --> 07:08.761
-Where does his family live?
-Over there.

07:10.555 --> 07:14.266
-In which city?
-In Bethlehem.

07:14.351 --> 07:17.520
-So they live in Bethlehem?
-I think so.

07:20.398 --> 07:24.360
Although this occurred many years ago,

07:25.362 --> 07:29.281
the story is often used to illustrate the

07:29.616 --> 07:35.579
effectiveness of the Israeli
security measures.

07:39.501 --> 07:43.546
She was stopped, as are all passengers
traveling on the airline,

07:44.631 --> 07:47.424
for an interview by an agent.

07:51.221 --> 07:55.432
Aspects of her story seemed suspicious
to this agent,

07:56.351 --> 07:59.019
including the fact that her fiancÃ©,

07:59.938 --> 08:05.860
the father of her unborn child,
was not traveling with her.

08:08.071 --> 08:13.200
According to the behavioral profiles
of Israeli security,

08:15.120 --> 08:19.331
pregnant women seldom traveled alone...

08:34.097 --> 08:36.640
-Is this all the money you're carrying?
-Yes.

08:37.267 --> 08:40.269
-How long you plan to stay?
-Two weeks.

08:40.352 --> 08:44.315
-With this much money?
-His family's meeting me there.

08:44.399 --> 08:46.233
And taking you to Bethlehem?

08:47.194 --> 08:51.322
Where you will get married
to the man you're not traveling with?

08:51.406 --> 08:54.825
He had business. He's meeting me there.

09:12.636 --> 09:14.637
I just need another minute.

09:17.307 --> 09:20.684
-I can feel the baby kicking.
-No, you can't.

09:20.769 --> 09:22.102
Yes, I can.

09:25.941 --> 09:27.816
There, it kicked again.

09:29.986 --> 09:31.987
I like your imagination.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.338
-What's wrong?
-Nothing.

09:53.677 --> 09:55.511
Why can't you come with me?

09:56.471 --> 10:00.099
-I told you, the ticket isn't changeable.
-Well, you changed yours.

10:00.183 --> 10:02.434
My boss paid to change mine.

10:03.937 --> 10:06.480
-He won't do it again.
-Why not?

10:06.564 --> 10:08.315
It's a business decision.

10:09.484 --> 10:12.528
-Yeah, but can't you explain?
-I've tried.

10:16.157 --> 10:17.366
I've tried.

10:22.539 --> 10:24.540
I don't want you to worry.

10:25.709 --> 10:30.045
They're going to treat you like a queen.
They'll take you to the hotel.

10:32.007 --> 10:34.091
I'll be there in two days.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.385
-Okay.
-Okay.

10:51.943 --> 10:53.402
I made them myself.

10:54.779 --> 10:58.157
It was your grandmother's idea,
but she never lived to see it.

11:00.285 --> 11:02.286
She did all the drawings.

11:04.372 --> 11:06.915
And here's a picture of her working on them.

11:07.250 --> 11:10.961
Mary, Joseph, the Three Wise Kings.

11:13.423 --> 11:18.427
I still have them in a drawer somewhere.
Have I ever shown them to you?

11:18.511 --> 11:21.055
-No.
-Your uncle helped me.

11:22.849 --> 11:26.018
Tom was always good with his hands.

11:37.364 --> 11:39.031
That's beautiful.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.041
Do you put it up every year?

11:55.173 --> 11:56.173
Yeah.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.870
Is this your son?

12:30.667 --> 12:33.627
We, too, believe that Jesus was a prophet.

12:35.880 --> 12:38.549
I think the Jews believe that, as well.

12:39.801 --> 12:42.636
-What do the Jews believe?
-That he was a prophet.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.221
But not the Messiah,

12:46.724 --> 12:49.309
-which is why they killed him.
-Excuse me.

12:50.395 --> 12:52.146
This is private property.

12:54.482 --> 12:57.192
-The road?
-You're not on the road.

13:26.764 --> 13:29.933
I often think about what must have been
going through my father's head

13:30.018 --> 13:32.269
as he talked my mother into his plan.

13:35.148 --> 13:36.231
Did he have any feelings for her?

13:36.316 --> 13:38.901
Was it difficult for him to go through with?

13:40.195 --> 13:42.029
Or was it possible that

13:42.113 --> 13:46.283
the only way he could talk himself
into doing it was because he loved her?

13:48.703 --> 13:53.248
And what about me,
the unborn child resting in her belly?

13:54.042 --> 13:56.376
Did I ever cross his mind?

13:56.461 --> 13:59.338
When I heard the story
in this classroom last week,

14:01.424 --> 14:04.343
all these images came flooding back to me.

14:05.553 --> 14:09.223
And we'll get married there.
Would you like that?

14:13.394 --> 14:15.437
-This is like a dream.
-What is?

14:16.898 --> 14:19.107
These look so beautiful on you.

14:22.445 --> 14:27.115
When I first told you I was pregnant,
you said you wanted nothing to do with it.

14:29.911 --> 14:33.956
-I was so confused.
-You said I was on my own.

14:37.293 --> 14:42.756
You are the greatest blessing in my life.
I didn't realize that.

14:44.384 --> 14:49.012
-And now you do?
-Yes. Now I do. I do. I do.

14:53.393 --> 14:56.270
-I will love you for always.
-For always?

14:56.354 --> 14:59.439
-For always.
-Forever. It's not "for always."

15:00.441 --> 15:01.483
Forever.

15:14.163 --> 15:16.957
-Why didn't you say anything?
-About what?

15:17.041 --> 15:20.085
When she said that stuff about
the Jews killing Jesus.

15:21.254 --> 15:24.548
-Why should I?
-So you just ask her to leave?

15:25.341 --> 15:28.176
Yeah, I asked her to leave, Simon.
She was crazy.

15:28.261 --> 15:31.597
Look, women like that,
they don't come to this part of town, okay?

15:31.681 --> 15:32.931
They don't walk around at night
by themselves.

15:33.016 --> 15:36.685
What if she moved down the street, Tom?
What if she was out taking a stroll?

15:36.769 --> 15:38.186
Well, then she's gonna learn
that you don't go around

15:38.271 --> 15:40.063
spouting that sort of crap.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.525
How's she gonna learn anything?

15:46.988 --> 15:51.283
You never engaged in a conversation
or defended a position.

15:51.367 --> 15:54.911
Defended a position?
I asked her to get off my property.

16:03.671 --> 16:06.298
So, look, Simon mentioned getting a loan.

16:06.382 --> 16:09.551
-Against what?
-Against the house.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.306
Tom, he doesn't have access
to your dad's house until he turns 25.

16:14.390 --> 16:15.599
-You know that.
-Yeah, I know.

16:15.683 --> 16:19.811
-Aren't you supposed to look after it?
-Look after it?

16:19.896 --> 16:21.521
His stuff, his affairs.

16:21.814 --> 16:22.981
You're the...

16:23.066 --> 16:24.608
-Executor.
-Yes.

16:25.318 --> 16:29.821
So you can't do anything to change that?
You can't help us out?

16:29.906 --> 16:32.407
It's locked in stone. He made sure of that.

16:34.243 --> 16:40.248
Look, if you need cash,
you can always sell your sister's violin.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.919
She left that to Simon.
That's worth a lot of money.

16:44.003 --> 16:45.087
Right.

16:46.089 --> 16:47.881
You made some choices, Tom.

16:48.424 --> 16:51.468
Taking over your sister's house in the city,

16:51.552 --> 16:53.387
letting Simon grow up there,

16:54.180 --> 16:57.891
I guess you must have thought
it was good to get away from your dad.

16:58.976 --> 17:00.394
But that cost you.

17:06.233 --> 17:07.233
Fuck it.

17:11.531 --> 17:14.532
That's good.
It's a good idea to start the act with that.

17:14.617 --> 17:18.369
And be careful with the ladder.
No more accidents, okay?

17:20.707 --> 17:25.877
-So, have you heard this story before?
-No.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.339
It just occurred to you to write it this way?

17:31.134 --> 17:34.302
Well, you told us to translate
as it came most naturally.

17:36.347 --> 17:42.060
And it came to you naturally
to imagine yourself as their son?

17:42.186 --> 17:45.230
Well, it just... It seemed cool.

17:46.566 --> 17:50.026
You know, that's why I needed
a few minutes more to rewrite it.

17:50.862 --> 17:53.572
-From his point of view.
-Like he was my age.

17:53.656 --> 17:58.577
Like he was me talking about his parents.

18:05.126 --> 18:07.043
I want you to work on this.

18:07.128 --> 18:09.212
I want you to present it next week
to the class.

18:09.297 --> 18:13.467
I want everyone to believe it's true,
that you're this couple's child.

18:13.676 --> 18:14.760
Why?

18:16.846 --> 18:18.305
As an exercise.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.099
An exercise in what?

18:28.816 --> 18:32.903
-I'm not sure if my French is that good.
-Then do it in English.

18:33.988 --> 18:36.573
-But you teach French.
-And Drama.

18:36.657 --> 18:39.910
-I'm not in Drama.
-Well, you are now.

18:56.052 --> 18:57.761
Your uncle's an angry man.

18:59.096 --> 19:01.973
Some people think he's stupid,
but that's not true.

19:03.601 --> 19:08.313
When someone carries that sort of anger
around all the time, they can seem stupid.

19:10.650 --> 19:14.277
That's the thing about anger.

19:14.362 --> 19:16.571
It sucks up a lot of intelligence.

19:18.407 --> 19:21.034
-Hey! Hey! What are you doing?
-You can't park here, man.

19:21.118 --> 19:22.661
So write me a ticket!

19:22.745 --> 19:24.162
I don't write the tickets.
You already got a ticket.

19:24.247 --> 19:28.667
-It's $55 to get me to stop.
-Otherwise?

19:28.751 --> 19:31.461
Otherwise, I'm gonna tow
your fucking car away.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.808
-Lady, I promise, I'm very good at this.
-Fuck!

19:44.892 --> 19:46.393
I'm going to pick it up,
we're gonna get out of here,

19:46.477 --> 19:47.644
everything's gonna be good. It's easy...

19:47.728 --> 19:49.563
Nothing, nothing,
nothing can happen to this car.

19:49.647 --> 19:52.023
Lady, I promise.
Nothing's going to happen, okay?

19:52.108 --> 19:54.442
Why don't you take a break? I promise.

19:54.527 --> 19:55.569
Yeah?

20:01.367 --> 20:04.619
I was driving it normally.
He said it was gonna be fine.

20:05.288 --> 20:08.832
What do you want me to do?
It's not my fault. The car just died.

20:23.472 --> 20:26.099
Well, I didn't do anything. It's not my fault.

20:26.183 --> 20:31.271
He's a fucking tow truck driver.
I didn't ask for his credentials.

20:40.531 --> 20:42.824
Hop in the truck. I'll be two seconds.

20:43.159 --> 20:44.492
We good, man?

21:08.851 --> 21:11.102
-May I open your bag?
-Sure.

21:15.358 --> 21:16.524
It's heavy.

21:25.701 --> 21:28.453
Please do not leave your bags unattended.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.288
What they found at the bottom
of my mother's bag

21:30.373 --> 21:33.375
were concealed plastic explosives
and a detonator.

21:34.710 --> 21:38.713
And if the bomb had gone off in mid-air,
as my father intended,

21:40.299 --> 21:43.385
all 400 people on board that flight
would have perished.

21:45.179 --> 21:47.639
I wouldn't be here to tell you the story.

21:51.519 --> 21:55.814
Simon is my best friend,
and I was really confused, too,

21:55.898 --> 21:57.941
when he was standing
in front of the classroom and he was talking,

21:58.025 --> 21:59.317
and I didn't know anything about it.
But then...

21:59.402 --> 22:04.489
You have to wake up and stop living
in your ignorant little box. Seriously.

22:04.573 --> 22:07.409
I am not living in an ignorant, little box.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.285
If he didn't want to tell me about
something like this,

22:09.370 --> 22:10.912
then there must have been a good reason.

22:10.997 --> 22:13.164
And if he doesn't want to talk to us about it,

22:13.249 --> 22:14.249
then there's a good reason for that, too.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.001
So I think we should all
just leave him alone because...

22:16.085 --> 22:20.130
A lot of you are wondering
why I haven't told you about this before.

22:20.214 --> 22:24.968
The reason is, well, I've...
I only found out a few months ago myself.

22:26.929 --> 22:30.306
I was asking my grandpa
a whole lot of questions before he died,

22:30.391 --> 22:37.063
and I kept this on my cell as a reminder.

22:40.151 --> 22:42.402
You have to believe me, Simon.

22:44.655 --> 22:46.406
Your father was a killer.

22:47.908 --> 22:50.785
If the bomb had gone off in mid-air,
as my father intended,

22:51.328 --> 22:54.414
it would have been the most devastating
terrorist attack of its time

22:54.498 --> 22:57.959
and my father would have gone down
in history as a mass-murderer.

22:58.878 --> 23:03.465
Except he wouldn't have gone down
as my father.

23:03.632 --> 23:05.759
I would have disappeared
in my mother's womb,

23:05.843 --> 23:08.970
along with all the other passengers
on board that flight.

23:11.307 --> 23:13.349
I wouldn't be here to tell you the story.

23:16.020 --> 23:17.103
How's that?

23:17.188 --> 23:19.481
Have you told anyone else about this?

23:19.982 --> 23:23.902
-That I'm making it up? No.
-Why not?

23:24.653 --> 23:28.490
If my friends found out it wasn't true,
it wouldn't be the same.

23:29.784 --> 23:32.077
What wouldn't be the same?

23:32.161 --> 23:36.831
The feeling I get when I'm performing.

23:38.584 --> 23:42.170
I mean, some parts of it
could almost be true,

23:43.714 --> 23:46.216
-but in a different way.
-In what way?

23:48.469 --> 23:51.721
Things about my family.

23:51.806 --> 23:55.308
Stuff... Stuff I haven't thought about
for a while.

24:01.273 --> 24:05.568
So, your father planted a bomb
on your mother?

24:06.529 --> 24:07.612
No.

24:09.698 --> 24:13.535
Well, sort of.

24:20.334 --> 24:23.169
-You live with your uncle?
-Yeah.

24:23.254 --> 24:25.547
Does he know about this project?

24:29.552 --> 24:34.139
-Are you going to tell him?
-I don't think he'd get it.

24:34.223 --> 24:36.349
He wasn't really raised to be tolerant
about this sort of thing,

24:36.433 --> 24:41.104
and his dad, my grandfather, he was...
He was a bit of a hard-ass.

24:43.232 --> 24:46.651
-That could change.
-He died last spring.

24:46.735 --> 24:48.486
Your uncle.

24:48.571 --> 24:51.072
He might be more open-minded
than you think.

24:52.241 --> 24:53.867
I wouldn't bet on that.

24:55.202 --> 24:59.539
Well, there is a way to find out.

25:18.976 --> 25:21.978
I came to apologize for yesterday.

25:23.230 --> 25:27.442
That was wrong of me,
to embarrass a father in front of his son.

25:28.485 --> 25:29.819
Okay.

25:31.989 --> 25:34.782
Is he here? Your boy?

25:36.118 --> 25:38.494
He's in his bedroom doing his homework.

25:39.914 --> 25:42.665
I wanted to explain
something I said yesterday.

25:48.339 --> 25:50.965
It will only take a minute of your time.

26:00.100 --> 26:02.185
All right. Why don't you come in?

26:27.002 --> 26:29.671
So why did you come to this part of the city?

26:31.131 --> 26:34.842
I was just driving around
and I saw your decorations.

26:35.511 --> 26:38.012
You were just driving around on your own?

26:40.182 --> 26:41.683
I do that sometimes.

26:42.518 --> 26:47.855
When I saw this public display of your faith,
it touched me.

26:50.150 --> 26:51.359
Why?

26:53.654 --> 26:56.072
I feel people staring at me all the time,

26:57.616 --> 27:03.121
wondering why I would make
such a visible statement of my belief.

27:04.540 --> 27:07.375
Where I come from, it's completely natural.

27:08.877 --> 27:12.422
Here, it threatens.

27:12.506 --> 27:15.133
And that surprises you?

27:15.217 --> 27:16.384
Yes.

27:16.468 --> 27:19.512
Like a woman in a bikini
wouldn't threaten you people?

27:21.724 --> 27:23.641
Us people?

27:27.730 --> 27:30.565
Maybe people really should
stick to their own kind.

27:32.735 --> 27:36.237
-That's how you were raised?
-Yeah, I was.

27:36.905 --> 27:40.616
-And you're okay with that?
-Yeah, I'm just fine with it.

28:00.804 --> 28:04.265
-Who is this?
-It's my sister.

28:12.691 --> 28:14.067
She's a musician?

28:14.943 --> 28:17.362
Yeah, she was. She died a few years ago.

28:18.113 --> 28:21.282
I'm sorry. How did she die?

28:22.159 --> 28:23.910
Car accident.

28:24.578 --> 28:25.620
Alone?

28:26.330 --> 28:29.832
-Excuse me?
-Was she alone in the car?

28:31.877 --> 28:33.628
No. The driver died, too.

28:36.131 --> 28:37.465
Was he a friend?

28:39.927 --> 28:43.888
Look, you said there was something
you wanted to explain about yesterday.

28:45.182 --> 28:48.643
-It was about your son.
-Well, he's not my son. He's my nephew.

28:48.852 --> 28:50.978
I raised him after my sister died.

28:55.818 --> 29:00.446
I'm sorry I used the word "Jew"
yesterday. That's not what I meant.

29:00.531 --> 29:03.074
The problem is not with the Jews and Christ.

29:03.158 --> 29:04.826
It's with the Zionists.

29:06.662 --> 29:09.205
Thank you. Thank you for making that clear.

29:10.666 --> 29:12.583
Are you making fun of me?

29:12.668 --> 29:17.672
Listen, your issues with Jews or Zionists
or whoever you happen to hate,

29:18.841 --> 29:22.135
they have nothing to do with my life
or Simon's.

29:22.219 --> 29:26.180
-That's how you were raised.
-Yes. That's exactly how I was raised.

29:31.103 --> 29:34.939
What must have been going through
my mother's mind as she sat in that room?

29:35.023 --> 29:39.652
And at that point, she couldn't have been
aware of the monstrosity of the betrayal,

29:39.736 --> 29:42.697
or what has come to be perceived
as a monstrosity.

29:45.784 --> 29:48.786
You know, when he first found out
what had happened,

29:48.871 --> 29:53.082
that she was pregnant with me,
he didn't want anything to do with it.

29:53.167 --> 29:56.586
He tried to convince her to abort me.

29:56.670 --> 29:59.964
My mother must have been crushed by this.

30:00.048 --> 30:06.471
But then, a few weeks later,
he showed up to declare his love for her.

30:07.639 --> 30:09.432
I want you to come with me.

30:13.270 --> 30:18.649
Rachel, I told you before.
I'll be there in a few days,

30:18.734 --> 30:22.069
-and my family will meet you there.
-They'll be upset.

30:23.864 --> 30:26.991
-Why?
-I'm pregnant.

30:27.075 --> 30:28.284
No, no. No.

30:32.414 --> 30:37.585
A child is cause for great celebration
and joy.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.462
They'll love you even more.

30:45.052 --> 30:48.971
I can feel sorry for him,
but I can't feel any amount of respect or...

30:49.056 --> 30:51.098
-Yeah.
-...try to humanize anything he did.

30:51.183 --> 30:54.560
I can only say, "Wow!
That kind of sucks that he was raised

30:54.645 --> 30:56.687
"and he grew up
and he thought that he had to do this

30:56.772 --> 30:57.772
-"to be enlightened."
-Exactly. It's been

30:57.856 --> 31:01.859
-implanted in his mind since the beginning.
-Or whatever he was thinking.

31:01.944 --> 31:03.027
So that's the only way he knows to live.

31:03.111 --> 31:06.280
So many things have been implanted
into all of our minds.

31:06.365 --> 31:08.866
You know? Like, where did I buy this?

31:08.951 --> 31:14.664
It's implanted in my mind to, like,
go get a good deal at, like, Nike and...

31:14.790 --> 31:17.416
Exactly, which is our culture,
yeah, and that's...

31:17.501 --> 31:19.418
I'm not trying to defend myself.

31:19.503 --> 31:23.256
I'm saying that
that stuff is ingrained in our brain,

31:23.340 --> 31:27.051
just like, you know,
blowing up stuff is ingrained in their brain.

31:27.135 --> 31:30.012
-Exactly, but when it hurts other people...
-And it does hurt other people.

31:30.097 --> 31:31.556
...I mean, but to a far higher degree.

31:31.640 --> 31:32.848
Is that something that our culture does?

31:32.933 --> 31:37.311
Yeah. So, to a far less degree,
we're harming someone, I suppose.

31:37.396 --> 31:38.688
No. Because we're doing it in...

31:38.772 --> 31:41.023
Why are we talking about capitalism
versus terrorism?

31:41.108 --> 31:43.901
-I don't know.
-Well, it's just like...

31:43.986 --> 31:50.116
I'm just saying that our minds are ingrained
with different values

31:50.200 --> 31:55.955
that also may be wrong values,
even though you don't even realize it.

31:56.039 --> 32:00.751
Right, but it's not blowing up 400 people
when I go and buy a hoodie.

32:00.836 --> 32:02.503
No, it's all for personal gain.

32:02.588 --> 32:05.214
We buy Nike because we think
we're gonna look cool.

32:05.299 --> 32:06.340
He wanted to blow up the plane

32:06.425 --> 32:08.884
'cause he thought he was going to get
40 virgins in the afterlife.

32:08.969 --> 32:09.969
Exactly!

32:10.053 --> 32:13.764
Simon's trying to humanize him.
That's fine, he's his father.

32:13.849 --> 32:16.642
Like, I would, too,
if I was making up a story about my father.

32:16.727 --> 32:20.271
I would try and humanize him. Like,
I would try... That's all part of the game.

32:20.355 --> 32:23.983
We're all victims of our circumstances,
then that's the norm.

32:24.067 --> 32:27.945
So there's nothing out of the ordinary
about how the father was raised.

32:28.030 --> 32:29.572
We're all innocent to some degree.

32:29.656 --> 32:34.368
Is it any worse for us to be
so over-indulgent and to let people die

32:34.453 --> 32:35.369
because they have no money
than, like, actually killing them ourselves?

32:35.370 --> 32:38.372
because they have no money
than, like, actually killing them ourselves?

32:39.041 --> 32:41.959
Does that mean
that we should have no opinion

32:42.044 --> 32:47.548
-on terrorists killing innocent people?
-I'm just saying are we that much better?

32:47.758 --> 32:51.510
Of course, we're much better!
Of course we are.

32:52.638 --> 32:56.265
Hey, guys. You've got to check this out.
You know how my mom's a prof?

32:56.350 --> 32:59.644
She's got this chat room
and they're talking all about Simon's story.

32:59.728 --> 33:01.479
What do you mean?

33:01.563 --> 33:03.981
They're talking about what happened
with your dad and everything.

33:04.066 --> 33:05.566
How'd they find out?

33:05.859 --> 33:08.986
Well, I told it to my mom.

33:09.071 --> 33:11.197
-You showed it to your mom?
-Why not?

33:11.281 --> 33:13.991
It's not like you're trying
to keep it a big secret anymore.

33:14.076 --> 33:17.078
I mean, why wouldn't you want people
to find out?

33:17.162 --> 33:21.874
Why is that so shocking,
so surprising to you that you feel

33:21.958 --> 33:25.336
that you have a sense of entitlement
in this story?

33:25.420 --> 33:30.007
I was on that plane. I was on that plane.
I don't call it a sense of entitlement.

33:30.133 --> 33:33.761
It happens to be that...
If it is evil, whatever it was,

33:33.845 --> 33:37.765
whatever Simon's father's intentions were,

33:37.849 --> 33:44.271
I could feel on my own skin
once I learned about it.

33:44.356 --> 33:50.820
I'm not sure that it was a trauma at the time.
I think we're just living it in our minds

33:50.904 --> 33:53.155
the way Simon is trying to live it in his mind.

33:53.240 --> 33:55.199
Yes. I think that the trauma happens later on,

33:55.283 --> 33:58.494
that it grows on you as time goes by,
almost like a cancer.

33:58.620 --> 34:00.371
Whether it's real or fictional,

34:00.455 --> 34:04.041
as soon as we imagine it, then it becomes
something that we have to deal with.

34:04.126 --> 34:08.045
I don't understand what's so seductive
about being a victim.

34:08.130 --> 34:10.297
We embrace the sense of being a victim

34:10.382 --> 34:14.719
almost to the extent that it blinds us
to the pain of others.

34:14.803 --> 34:18.139
It's like a suit of clothes
that's so comfortable today.

34:18.223 --> 34:20.558
His father basically ruined my life.

34:20.641 --> 34:23.476
I mean, I've been pretty much...

34:23.562 --> 34:26.313
Since, you know... And...

34:27.733 --> 34:30.275
Since it happened, I've been pretty much...

34:30.360 --> 34:35.114
My eating is completely out of control.
Has been. I've gained about 100 pounds.

34:35.197 --> 34:40.745
And I just can't...
I can't seem to get it together

34:40.829 --> 34:43.789
to just basically do anything.

34:43.873 --> 34:48.753
So when I do work, I have to travel by plane,
it basically goes like this.

34:48.837 --> 34:53.424
Like, one second after another second,
it's like, "Is it going to explode?

34:53.507 --> 34:55.676
"Is it going to explode?
Is it going to explode?"

34:55.761 --> 34:58.012
Second after second after second.

34:58.096 --> 35:00.097
"Is it going to explode?
Is it going to explode?"

35:00.182 --> 35:02.683
The next second, "Is it going to explode?"

35:03.185 --> 35:06.645
-It's like that. I mean, you know...
-I've known David for 25 years,

35:06.730 --> 35:12.276
and he's just a different man. Like, he's just
not the same person that he used to be.

35:12.360 --> 35:15.780
It's not like I was such a great person
to begin with,

35:15.864 --> 35:20.993
but I think that I am the guy
who was blown to smithereens.

35:21.077 --> 35:22.828
-What?
-Okay? In a terrorist attack.

35:22.913 --> 35:28.626
And I've come back from the dead
to rage against the fucking assholes

35:28.710 --> 35:34.006
who believe that killing someone
for an idea is something that's viable!

35:34.090 --> 35:38.552
The idea that somebody
would put their pregnant wife on a plane...

35:38.637 --> 35:43.432
...would choose, because I'm Jewish
or because the plane was going to Israel,

35:43.517 --> 35:46.644
to kill everyone on the flight,
I mean, that's the most sickening,

35:46.728 --> 35:49.355
disgusting, despicable thing
I've ever heard of in my life.

35:49.439 --> 35:52.066
But you weren't, in fact,
blown to smithereens.

35:52.150 --> 35:55.402
-I don't understand why you say...
-Did you hear what I said?

35:55.487 --> 35:58.614
"I am the guy
who came back from the dead!"

35:58.698 --> 36:00.324
I am speaking for them.

36:01.868 --> 36:05.996
The school's position is that you
encouraged him to take it as far as he could.

36:06.081 --> 36:09.959
-As a drama exercise.
-But he wasn't in the Drama Club.

36:10.043 --> 36:12.253
You weren't teaching him drama.

36:12.337 --> 36:16.006
This monologue was presented
in your French class. Is that correct?

36:17.926 --> 36:19.552
I don't understand, Sabine.

36:19.636 --> 36:22.346
You convinced this boy
to present it as the truth.

36:22.430 --> 36:24.890
As a way of developing it.

36:24.975 --> 36:28.435
I just did not understand it would go
as far as it did.

36:29.604 --> 36:32.940
He never told me
he was going to post it on the Net.

36:33.775 --> 36:36.777
I don't know how we'd proceed with this,
Sabine.

36:36.862 --> 36:39.405
You're saying that it's wrongful dismissal,

36:39.948 --> 36:45.119
and yet everything the school
is claiming you did, you did.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.872
Well, whether or not you knew
he was going to post it

36:47.956 --> 36:51.333
and that it would get such a reaction
is not really the issue.

36:52.544 --> 36:55.129
No, I just don't want to waste your money.

37:05.849 --> 37:09.852
Why did you choose to read
that particular article to the students,

37:09.936 --> 37:12.229
about the man
wanting to blow up the plane?

37:12.314 --> 37:18.110
It's a challenging piece to translate.
It happened the month I came here.

37:19.279 --> 37:21.906
Why?

37:21.990 --> 37:25.075
My parents were killed in Beirut.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.494
We couldn't stay there.

37:27.579 --> 37:29.830
No. I meant why is it so challenging?

37:46.056 --> 37:48.641
No. I have to go.

37:55.023 --> 37:57.775
Yeah. This is a tow-away zone,
employee parking.

37:57.859 --> 37:59.985
You'll have to pay his release fee.

38:03.365 --> 38:05.032
Is this your car?

38:12.332 --> 38:15.042
-Yes.
-Okay. It's $55.

38:16.544 --> 38:19.964
-What for?
-To get me to stop.

38:20.048 --> 38:22.549
And if I don't want you to stop?

38:24.177 --> 38:28.806
-What do you mean?
-If I want you to keep doing your job.

38:28.890 --> 38:31.850
-Yeah, my job's to tow your car away.
-Yeah.

38:34.104 --> 38:37.982
-I understand.
-You understand? You're sure?

38:39.734 --> 38:42.069
I'm serious. I'm going to tow it away.

38:45.532 --> 38:48.993
-Hey!
-Hey. Hey, hey, hey. This is your car, right?

38:50.745 --> 38:53.455
-Yes.
-Yeah? All right. Hold on. Hold on.

38:58.086 --> 39:00.337
You change your mind, give me a call.

39:52.932 --> 39:54.933
-Can I see?
-Yeah.

39:58.480 --> 40:00.689
-Can I put it up now?
-Yeah.

40:00.774 --> 40:01.857
Thank you.

40:05.195 --> 40:07.488
-Should we make one of Daddy?
-Yeah.

41:15.890 --> 41:19.810
-Yeah?
-It's me. I'm behind you in the taxi.

41:19.894 --> 41:22.813
-Why?
-Where are you taking my car?

41:23.231 --> 41:25.607
-I'm taking it to a lot.
-Is it far away?

41:25.942 --> 41:27.693
No. It's a few minutes from here.

41:27.777 --> 41:29.528
Is there one further away?

41:29.737 --> 41:32.322
Yeah. I can go south to Lakeshore.

41:32.407 --> 41:35.450
Well, I want you to take it
to the one furthest away.

41:35.910 --> 41:38.745
-Any reason?
-I need time.

41:39.581 --> 41:40.622
Time for what?

41:40.999 --> 41:45.419
To think. Please. Just keep driving.

41:45.503 --> 41:47.421
Whatever you want.
But it's going to cost you.

41:47.505 --> 41:50.382
That's okay. I'll pay whatever it costs.

42:08.526 --> 42:11.945
-Do you know this guy?
-No.

42:13.448 --> 42:17.993
-So, what's this about?
-Just keep driving.

42:25.001 --> 42:26.418
My mother would have had no idea

42:26.502 --> 42:29.296
of the political situation
she was entering into.

42:30.006 --> 42:34.343
She would have no idea that Bethlehem
at that time was under Israeli control.

42:35.303 --> 42:39.514
My father was giving her no sense
of the violence that had marked that region,

42:40.058 --> 42:41.850
the history of persecution.

42:43.811 --> 42:50.776
My father wanted nothing more than justice,
any sort of justice for his rage,

42:52.820 --> 42:58.533
and he was prepared to sacrifice
the two of us for this noble cause.

43:00.161 --> 43:02.037
You know,
most people have seen this action

43:02.121 --> 43:04.915
as the most horrifying and cynical thing

43:04.999 --> 43:07.876
that a father and husband could inflict
on a family.

43:08.836 --> 43:14.174
And I've come to understand
that it is not the fact.

43:16.844 --> 43:18.595
My father was giving us a gift.

43:18.680 --> 43:20.389
-Wow!
-Simon, if you want to think that's a gift,

43:20.473 --> 43:23.100
you go right ahead,
but I think that's cowardly.

43:23.184 --> 43:26.103
He has a point. He does have a point.
I believe that he has a point.

43:26.187 --> 43:30.274
If he had given you that gift,
you wouldn't be here to say it was a gift.

43:30.358 --> 43:32.776
What? Hannah, you don't think people
can die for a cause?

43:32.860 --> 43:35.445
People can die for a cause, that's fine,
but don't sacrifice other people.

43:35.530 --> 43:37.531
You do not believe that
there is such a thing as a martyr.

43:37.615 --> 43:39.408
How would the wife have been a martyr?

43:39.492 --> 43:41.660
She didn't know what she was dying...
What she was going to die for.

43:41.744 --> 43:43.787
He was doing it
because he believed in something.

43:43.871 --> 43:45.914
Yeah, but he didn't die. He wasn't...

43:45.999 --> 43:50.961
He was doing something to better the world!
He was doing something to better the world!

43:51.045 --> 43:52.713
And, you know,
he has a point when he does that.

43:52.797 --> 43:58.468
I understand your need to, sort of, think
of your father as someone giving a gift,

43:58.553 --> 44:02.264
but I really can't see how
there's any kind of justification

44:02.390 --> 44:04.641
in that much murder
and that much destruction.

44:04.726 --> 44:07.811
And who's on that plane?
Probably people like us.

44:07.895 --> 44:11.023
It's not gonna be people
who are making big political decisions.

44:11.107 --> 44:12.774
Hundreds of other lives...

44:12.859 --> 44:16.695
I'm Daniel, and I heard about
your chat room through a colleague of mine

44:16.779 --> 44:18.488
whose daughter goes to your school.

44:18.573 --> 44:22.659
Now, why did Simon's father
not board the plane himself?

44:22.744 --> 44:25.203
You've acknowledged the possibility
that the man is a coward.

44:25.288 --> 44:28.790
You've acknowledged the possibility
that the man is a monster.

44:28.875 --> 44:33.587
Is it possible that this man just
and quite simply

44:33.671 --> 44:36.882
wanted to view the consequences
of his actions?

44:36.966 --> 44:42.012
You cannot underestimate the deep,
earthly satisfaction

44:42.096 --> 44:45.515
of viewing work you've done
while you are still alive.

44:45.850 --> 44:47.851
It was a heinous crime!

44:49.979 --> 44:52.481
The truth is that I don't think that
whatever happened to Simon's parents,

44:52.565 --> 44:56.693
it's not about concepts and an ideology
and who's a martyr.

44:56.778 --> 45:00.280
This is about that this happened
to his mother.

45:00.365 --> 45:02.532
So why don't you all just shut up?
'Cause why don't you just imagine

45:02.617 --> 45:04.659
what it would be like to be his mother?

45:04.744 --> 45:07.329
You're pregnant and you think
that you have this wonderful husband

45:07.413 --> 45:10.832
who loves you and then he's planning
on killing you and 400 other people.

45:11.793 --> 45:15.879
His parents were killed in a car accident,
Sabine, eight years ago.

45:15.963 --> 45:18.757
They crashed into an oncoming vehicle.

45:18.841 --> 45:23.470
Well, this would have happened
long before that, before he was born.

45:24.597 --> 45:27.349
Would have. So he is lying.

45:27.433 --> 45:30.519
He's making it up for the play he's writing.

45:30.603 --> 45:35.065
Look, I know all about his parents.
I know all the details about the accident.

45:35.149 --> 45:38.652
What are you? Are you an inspector?
You read the police reports?

45:39.320 --> 45:44.616
Well, that's what he's exploring
with this monologue.

45:44.700 --> 45:46.660
And you want me to approve it?

45:47.161 --> 45:50.122
I want you to be aware of what we are doing.

45:50.206 --> 45:51.415
Why?

45:53.126 --> 45:56.211
Because I would like to present it
at the Drama Festival.

45:56.295 --> 45:58.338
No. Absolutely not. No.

45:59.674 --> 46:02.926
You know, I have no problem with him
writing whatever he wants,

46:03.010 --> 46:04.553
as long as it doesn't promote hatred

46:04.637 --> 46:08.098
and as long as everyone knows
that it is fiction,

46:08.182 --> 46:09.975
that he's making it up.

46:11.144 --> 46:15.021
-I put this into my pocket by accident.
-By accident?

46:15.815 --> 46:18.483
You know, I thought the idea
was to test my uncle's tolerance,

46:18.568 --> 46:20.235
not to steal things.

46:20.319 --> 46:22.446
Listen, I talked to the principal.

46:23.906 --> 46:26.616
He wants people to know
that you're making this up.

46:26.701 --> 46:29.369
Why? That's what makes it so interesting.

46:29.454 --> 46:32.622
It's the only way he'll let you
present it at the Drama Festival.

46:32.707 --> 46:35.000
So let's wait until then.

46:36.377 --> 46:38.420
I don't think that's a good idea.

46:40.965 --> 46:42.090
I do.

46:47.388 --> 46:49.264
Keep it.

47:07.450 --> 47:09.075
-Yeah?
-Hi. It's me again.

47:09.160 --> 47:12.078
-I was wondering, have you had lunch?
-Excuse me?

47:12.163 --> 47:15.165
-I was wondering if you had lunch.
-No.

47:15.249 --> 47:18.960
-Well, what if I invite you out?
-For what?

47:19.045 --> 47:21.254
For lunch.

47:21.339 --> 47:24.424
-Lady...
-Sabine. My name is Sabine.

47:24.509 --> 47:28.053
-Yeah, look...
-Is there a place you would like to go?

47:28.137 --> 47:32.265
-Look, I'm a busy guy.
-Yeah? What makes you so busy?

47:33.768 --> 47:37.103
-Lady, I got a lunch right here.
-So keep it for tomorrow.

47:37.188 --> 47:42.359
-Hold on. Sir, have you had lunch?
-No.

47:42.443 --> 47:45.695
-Are you hungry?
-I could eat.

48:01.963 --> 48:03.755
He seems to be enjoying it.

48:07.969 --> 48:09.177
Yeah, he does.

48:11.889 --> 48:14.349
Does your wife pack your lunch every day?

48:15.893 --> 48:19.104
-No. I make it myself.
-You're not married?

48:19.188 --> 48:24.192
No. I got into the habit
when I had to make lunch for my kid.

48:24.986 --> 48:26.653
You were married?

48:28.155 --> 48:32.325
No. No, no, no. My nephew, my sister's kid.

48:33.452 --> 48:35.287
I raised him after she died.

48:37.665 --> 48:42.085
-Is the father around?
-No. They died together.

48:43.087 --> 48:44.546
It was an accident.

48:47.842 --> 48:50.260
How old were you?

48:50.344 --> 48:53.054
How old was I? I was 22.

48:54.390 --> 48:55.473
Thank you.

49:00.187 --> 49:03.898
That's a lot of responsibility,
raising a child at that age.

49:03.983 --> 49:07.694
-Yeah, I guess so.
-She must have trusted you.

49:18.205 --> 49:24.336
And now you put up decorations
as a way of remembering her.

49:31.969 --> 49:34.888
I'm sorry. It was a very stupid thing to do.

49:39.226 --> 49:43.188
-Who are you?
-Simon's teacher, French and Drama.

49:44.565 --> 49:47.942
-You're the one that was fired?
-That's right.

49:48.027 --> 49:50.904
I was coming out of my lawyer's office
when we met.

49:53.783 --> 49:55.992
Do they know about that?

49:56.077 --> 49:58.244
Do they know that you came to my house
and stole that?

49:58.329 --> 50:00.747
No. I'm sorry.

50:02.166 --> 50:05.001
-Does Simon know?
-That it was me?

50:05.086 --> 50:07.003
Of course.

50:07.088 --> 50:08.713
We planned it together.

50:13.427 --> 50:18.640
He doesn't think you're very open-minded.
I wanted to prove that you were.

50:20.559 --> 50:23.353
It was important for the play
he wanted to write.

50:24.271 --> 50:25.980
-Lady...
-I thought it would do him good and...

50:26.065 --> 50:30.276
You're fucked up. You're fucked up.
You did that.

50:31.904 --> 50:36.408
You got him to post that stuff about his dad
being a terrorist. You did that?

50:36.492 --> 50:38.868
I had absolutely no idea
he would go that far.

50:38.953 --> 50:41.913
-Well, he took it that far.
-Yes, I know.

50:41.997 --> 50:45.458
And I'm very sorry about it,
but it was not my intention.

50:46.752 --> 50:47.794
Please.

50:49.130 --> 50:51.631
Do you know what you've done to that kid?

50:52.133 --> 50:54.801
-I wouldn't have let him...
-Do you know?

50:57.054 --> 51:01.433
Mary, Joseph, baby Jesus.

51:06.981 --> 51:10.692
It was your grandmother's idea,
but she never lived to see it.

51:10.776 --> 51:12.777
She loved Christmas.

51:14.488 --> 51:16.239
Didn't she, Tommy?

51:18.784 --> 51:20.368
Didn't she what?

51:20.870 --> 51:24.706
I was just telling Simon
how much your mom loved Christmas.

51:26.167 --> 51:29.836
-According to who, Dad?
-Don't you remember?

51:30.838 --> 51:32.297
No.

51:32.548 --> 51:36.384
What I remember, Dad,
is Christmas wasn't such a great time

51:36.469 --> 51:39.262
'cause it meant we had to
spend more time with you.

51:40.639 --> 51:43.349
Actually, we all kind of hated Christmas.

51:43.434 --> 51:45.602
Don't you believe him.

51:46.687 --> 51:50.064
They're in the drawer of my desk,
the roll-top desk.

51:51.150 --> 51:52.901
Beautiful drawings.

52:02.828 --> 52:05.079
You have to believe me, Simon.

52:09.168 --> 52:12.796
I've been thinking
about the virgins and heaven,

52:12.880 --> 52:16.007
and I'm wondering, Simon,
whether it's possible to...

52:17.384 --> 52:20.386
To delay divine reward.

52:21.430 --> 52:26.017
I mean, that way we can kill people
and witness our actions,

52:26.101 --> 52:29.187
feel the satisfaction
that I was talking about before,

52:30.731 --> 52:33.274
and then get martyred after,

52:33.901 --> 52:35.568
get the virgins after.

52:36.362 --> 52:40.573
I mean, what do you think,
can we get a rain check for martyrdom?

52:40.658 --> 52:43.993
What did your father think? Did he qualify?

52:45.246 --> 52:48.206
I can't answer your question.

52:48.290 --> 52:52.961
I have... I have no idea if my father
ever intended to kill himself

52:53.045 --> 52:55.797
or if the virgins even appealed to him.

52:55.881 --> 52:57.632
He loved my mother.

52:57.716 --> 53:01.052
And I'm sure if he got to know
the other people on that plane,

53:01.136 --> 53:04.764
he might have liked them, too.
But that's not the point.

53:05.432 --> 53:10.937
I think that this idea we get, that if you get
to know someone, if you humanize them,

53:11.021 --> 53:15.608
it stops you from pulling the trigger
or setting off the bomb or whatever...

53:17.319 --> 53:21.739
Well, you know, that's just a myth we're
taught, something we get from the movies.

53:22.074 --> 53:27.704
When the reality might be that that's
what actually inspires an extreme action

53:28.289 --> 53:33.960
that is actually being done to someone
that you like, or in this case, with my dad,

53:35.421 --> 53:36.963
people that you love.

53:37.298 --> 53:38.715
What do you want from me?

53:38.799 --> 53:41.759
-I just want you to step into this world.
-Why?

53:41.844 --> 53:45.889
And show these people that there are people
like you that have suffered and survived.

53:45.973 --> 53:49.893
Not like these bullshitters who don't know
what the fuck they're talking about!

53:49.977 --> 53:51.978
Don't say such words to me.

53:52.062 --> 53:55.398
Come on, Bubbe. Just for me.

53:55.482 --> 53:58.651
Show the world that there are people
like you that have survived.

53:58.736 --> 54:01.487
-Yeah.
-Okay. Come on.

54:01.572 --> 54:06.284
-No. I'll do it myself, darling.
-You want to get up by yourself? Go ahead.

54:07.870 --> 54:11.039
Who cares about them?
I don't care about them.

54:11.123 --> 54:13.124
Just go a little closer.

54:16.587 --> 54:20.214
-Come on.
-I'll do it. What?

54:21.050 --> 54:22.467
Show them.

54:26.680 --> 54:28.848
Yeah, I'll show them. Yeah.

54:33.354 --> 54:36.940
There, you see? 46224.

54:37.733 --> 54:39.859
That's pretty emotional stuff.

54:41.528 --> 54:44.322
Simon, you should be proud of your father.

54:44.406 --> 54:48.451
Your father was a hero.
Your father stood for the truth, Simon.

54:49.536 --> 54:51.204
I'm a victim, too.

54:51.830 --> 54:54.457
I'm a victim of years of propaganda,

54:54.541 --> 54:56.542
years of lies.

54:59.713 --> 55:03.299
Here's my tattoo. You like that?

55:03.968 --> 55:05.969
See that? You read that?

55:07.221 --> 55:09.097
That's what I have written on my body.

55:09.181 --> 55:13.309
If you had contemplated somebody
other than yourself for five stinking minutes,

55:13.394 --> 55:15.103
face the idea that...

55:17.898 --> 55:19.273
-Hi.
-Hi.

55:23.946 --> 55:26.030
-Who's he?
-Some guy.

55:26.782 --> 55:29.784
-What, is he trying to pick you up?
-Right.

55:34.748 --> 55:37.709
Where do you keep
your mom's violin, Simon?

55:38.085 --> 55:39.085
It's...

55:39.920 --> 55:42.839
It's at the top of the cupboard on the back.

55:44.800 --> 55:45.800
Yeah.

55:47.803 --> 55:48.928
Why?

55:51.849 --> 55:54.600
When was the last time you took it out?

55:55.102 --> 55:58.938
When we went to see Grandpa
at the hospital last spring.

55:59.023 --> 56:01.357
Right. The confession that never happened.

56:01.442 --> 56:05.111
-Well, maybe there's nothing to confess.
-I wouldn't bet on that.

56:07.239 --> 56:09.824
Do you know something that I don't?

56:14.121 --> 56:16.330
Would my dad have done that?

56:16.665 --> 56:19.125
Crashed the car on purpose?

56:22.713 --> 56:25.631
I wish I could answer that, Simon. I can't.

56:26.675 --> 56:29.218
I didn't get to know him that well.

56:35.642 --> 56:39.979
Look, I was talking to Nick
about the loan idea. It won't work,

56:40.439 --> 56:42.231
not until you're 25.

56:56.580 --> 56:59.373
You know the story about this mark here?

57:00.501 --> 57:03.044
You know it's how your parents met?

57:05.756 --> 57:10.134
See, your mom, she went into
this repair place to get some work done.

57:10.219 --> 57:12.804
And this guy, your dad,

57:14.932 --> 57:16.682
he had this old...

57:18.685 --> 57:21.729
-What do you call this part right here?
-It's a scroll.

57:22.606 --> 57:24.023
A scroll.

57:25.526 --> 57:30.154
He had this old scroll that he had saved,
and he told her he could put it on.

57:32.533 --> 57:34.033
Hers was new.

57:39.248 --> 57:41.874
I don't know the rest of the details.

57:42.835 --> 57:45.211
I found the invoices for the job,

57:46.004 --> 57:48.965
the drawings,
and my dad sketched it all out.

57:51.969 --> 57:53.302
Excuse me.

58:00.352 --> 58:03.479
I guess he wanted her to know
how it would work.

58:04.731 --> 58:06.691
That's very detailed.

58:07.526 --> 58:10.361
He must have liked to plan everything out.

58:17.661 --> 58:20.288
Are you asking me if you can sell it?

58:28.088 --> 58:30.006
Listen to me.

58:30.090 --> 58:33.259
When they died,
I moved down here to look after you.

58:34.553 --> 58:36.762
I wanted to keep you here.

58:37.055 --> 58:38.598
I wanted to keep you in this house.

58:38.682 --> 58:41.934
It was also a chance
to get away from your father.

58:43.145 --> 58:46.439
Things are expensive here, Simon.
You should know that.

58:47.691 --> 58:49.525
We're still carrying the mortgage
on this place.

58:49.610 --> 58:51.611
You're going to be needing money
for university.

58:51.695 --> 58:53.779
What do you want me to do?

59:05.375 --> 59:07.168
Can I think about it?

59:11.381 --> 59:13.591
Yeah, you can think about it.

59:14.384 --> 59:17.136
I know it means a lot. I understand that.

59:22.309 --> 59:25.394
There's something
that I don't understand, Tom.

59:26.730 --> 59:28.564
Why would my dad
want to put a new scroll on?

59:28.649 --> 59:32.902
I mean, it doesn't really increase
the value of the violin.

59:32.986 --> 59:37.114
You could cut it right off
and it would be just as valuable, right?

59:38.283 --> 59:39.742
I don't know.

59:45.958 --> 59:50.503
There's something that my father did that
might explain his character a little better.

59:50.587 --> 59:53.923
When he met my mom,
he was repairing violins.

59:54.007 --> 59:55.675
That was his job.

59:56.510 --> 59:58.928
She came in with this instrument.

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:03.349
Well, it's... It's a long story.

01:00:03.850 --> 01:00:07.103
But the last time I was saying

01:00:07.771 --> 01:00:09.939
that it wouldn't have mattered if my father

01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:11.774
had seen the other people
on board that flight.

01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:16.404
It wouldn't have changed his mind
if he'd recognized their humanity.

01:00:17.656 --> 01:00:19.282
And I realized

01:00:19.491 --> 01:00:21.325
that you never know when

01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:24.787
or how something might affect you.

01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:26.706
I mean, most of the times
when we find ourselves

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:28.916
most affected by something

01:00:29.459 --> 01:00:32.211
is when we think it might be taken away.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.715
And that's when you need to act.

01:00:35.924 --> 01:00:39.218
Well, Simon,
I feel like I'm losing you right now,

01:00:39.303 --> 01:00:40.761
because if you think
that it's easier to project

01:00:40.846 --> 01:00:42.722
your feelings onto a thing
rather than a person,

01:00:42.806 --> 01:00:46.183
then I'm wondering what your response is
to what you're looking at right now.

01:00:46.268 --> 01:00:50.688
Because right now I'm just a thing
on whatever it is that you're watching me on.

01:00:50.772 --> 01:00:52.857
But you're looking at my face
and you're looking into my eyes

01:00:52.941 --> 01:00:55.026
and you're listening to my voice.

01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:58.154
So whatever it is that you're reacting to,
this thing wouldn't be here if my parents

01:00:58.238 --> 01:01:01.907
had been on the plane that day
and your father's bomb had gone off.

01:01:02.743 --> 01:01:04.744
That's a stretch, Hannah.

01:01:07.039 --> 01:01:12.960
I guess I've had a lot of people
responding who were on that plane.

01:01:14.296 --> 01:01:18.716
Maybe there's part of you that wishes
your parents could be part of that club.

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:21.844
This community of people
who are remembering

01:01:21.928 --> 01:01:24.430
a catastrophe that never happened.

01:01:25.182 --> 01:01:28.768
Look, I guess the assumption here
is that our lives are precious.

01:01:28.977 --> 01:01:33.147
But we know that's not feasible.
I mean, it's just not how nature works.

01:01:33.732 --> 01:01:36.192
If every life was precious,

01:01:36.276 --> 01:01:38.611
the world would not be able to sustain itself.

01:01:38.695 --> 01:01:42.490
We'd go forth and multiply ourselves
into extinction.

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:45.993
So it's just common sense.

01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:51.457
So... So how... How do we prevent this?

01:01:52.292 --> 01:01:54.377
There's disease, famine.

01:01:54.461 --> 01:01:58.297
We generate wars, we plan genocides,

01:01:58.924 --> 01:02:03.302
but occasionally someone's got to
take the matter into their own hands

01:02:03.387 --> 01:02:05.971
and wipe out a bunch of other lives.

01:02:07.265 --> 01:02:08.557
When the police, they showed me the tape

01:02:08.642 --> 01:02:10.810
of him saying those things,
that was not Simon.

01:02:10.894 --> 01:02:12.603
-No.
-That was someone else.

01:02:12.687 --> 01:02:14.814
-He was pretending.
-Why?

01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:18.901
Maybe he was trying to work something out.

01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:21.237
Thank you. That was delicious.

01:02:21.488 --> 01:02:23.697
What kind of bologna was that?

01:02:26.118 --> 01:02:29.161
-It wasn't bologna.
-But something like that.

01:02:30.288 --> 01:02:32.248
Yeah, it was something like that.

01:02:32.332 --> 01:02:34.542
My shift is ending now.

01:02:34.626 --> 01:02:36.752
That'll be $75.

01:02:37.254 --> 01:02:38.587
Excuse me.

01:02:38.713 --> 01:02:39.880
Any reason why you didn't tell us you were

01:02:39.965 --> 01:02:42.591
finishing your shift
before you took my lunch?

01:02:42.676 --> 01:02:44.385
I didn't take it.

01:02:45.429 --> 01:02:48.472
-It was offered.
-What about deducting my meal?

01:02:48.849 --> 01:02:51.892
-Why would I do that?
-Why would you do that? Courtesy.

01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:54.562
Courtesy.

01:02:57.774 --> 01:03:01.402
It was courteous of this woman
to invite you out.

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:06.073
It was certainly courteous of her
to offer me your lunch.

01:03:06.199 --> 01:03:10.578
I'm not sure how courteous it is
to now demand a payment.

01:03:10.662 --> 01:03:13.330
You know what? Don't fuck with me.

01:03:13.415 --> 01:03:15.749
Why not? You're fucking with me.

01:03:17.085 --> 01:03:20.463
I assumed, given the circumstance,
that it was a gift.

01:03:20.922 --> 01:03:24.800
Now you're asking to have it back.
Since I can't give it back,

01:03:24.885 --> 01:03:26.677
-you're extorting me for money.
-Right.

01:03:26.761 --> 01:03:28.804
Money I earned doing my job.

01:03:28.889 --> 01:03:32.224
-No. Do not give him the money.
-Really, it's okay. It's not a problem.

01:03:32.309 --> 01:03:34.894
-Why don't you get the fuck out of here?
-No. What do you propose?

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:38.355
That I give your lunch back?

01:03:41.318 --> 01:03:44.445
-Oh, yeah? Okay. Okay. Okay.
-Get the fuck out of here!

01:03:44.529 --> 01:03:47.698
Get the fuck out of here! Get in the car
and get the fuck out of here!

01:03:47.782 --> 01:03:50.326
-Don't touch me again.
-I'll touch you again. Get in the fucking car.

01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:52.536
Get in the fucking car.

01:04:05.634 --> 01:04:06.926
Thanks.

01:04:57.811 --> 01:05:00.771
-Get in your fucking car!
-Big tough guy!

01:05:57.329 --> 01:05:59.622
How long have you had this violin?

01:05:59.706 --> 01:06:01.540
Since I was 14.

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:04.460
My father gave it to me.

01:06:06.463 --> 01:06:08.130
It's quite a gift.

01:06:12.177 --> 01:06:15.054
He must have known that you were special.

01:06:15.513 --> 01:06:17.139
What do you mean?

01:06:22.896 --> 01:06:24.563
A great musician.

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:29.526
That's what makes me special?

01:06:30.695 --> 01:06:31.737
No.

01:06:36.076 --> 01:06:38.786
You're special for what is in you.

01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:42.498
That's where the music comes from.

01:07:01.685 --> 01:07:03.936
Why did you let that go so far, Simon?

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:07.189
You made people remember that day
when they almost lost their lives,

01:07:07.273 --> 01:07:10.567
and you told people that it was your dad
who tried to do it.

01:07:10.652 --> 01:07:14.863
So whether they were sad for you
or mad at you or whatever,

01:07:14.948 --> 01:07:18.784
why would you make people feel
all those things if it wasn't even true?

01:07:52.193 --> 01:07:54.111
I'm unloading your car.

01:07:55.864 --> 01:07:58.157
You haven't finished your food.

01:07:58.908 --> 01:08:00.784
I don't want the food.

01:08:02.579 --> 01:08:04.705
You were asking about Simon,

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:08.667
what it was that he was trying to work out.

01:08:09.419 --> 01:08:12.504
Lady, we're all trying
to work things out. Okay?

01:08:13.423 --> 01:08:16.759
Sabine. You can call me Sabine.

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:19.678
Lady,

01:08:22.807 --> 01:08:25.058
you force yourself into my house,

01:08:25.143 --> 01:08:29.145
you plan to have me tow your car.
So now I know who you are, and it's over.

01:08:32.692 --> 01:08:34.651
You don't know who I am.

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:37.613
Yes, I do. Listen to me.

01:08:39.323 --> 01:08:42.658
I was never into plays or drama in school.

01:08:42.743 --> 01:08:47.497
I don't understand this pretending stuff.
I don't like this pretending stuff.

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:51.126
You're playing games with people.

01:08:51.711 --> 01:08:53.712
That's not what I'm doing.

01:08:53.962 --> 01:08:56.381
That's exactly what you're doing.

01:08:59.761 --> 01:09:02.763
Simon's parents were killed
in a car accident.

01:09:03.096 --> 01:09:05.557
-I told you that.
-The driver of the truck said

01:09:05.642 --> 01:09:07.725
they crashed into him on purpose,

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:12.397
that Sami drove into the head-on collision.

01:09:25.245 --> 01:09:27.246
How do you know his name?

01:09:28.038 --> 01:09:30.541
Sami had a condition with his eyes.

01:09:31.292 --> 01:09:34.002
He wasn't supposed to drive at night.

01:09:34.087 --> 01:09:35.712
How do you know?

01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:40.300
I was married to him

01:09:41.928 --> 01:09:45.930
for five years until he met your sister

01:09:49.352 --> 01:09:50.894
at his store.

01:09:54.315 --> 01:09:57.109
He was the one who repaired her violin.

01:10:03.950 --> 01:10:06.785
The good news is that it's authentic.

01:10:09.414 --> 01:10:12.624
The bad news is that... Sorry.

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:19.798
The bad news is that
this whole piece of the violin is new.

01:10:21.134 --> 01:10:22.551
Does it affect the sound?

01:10:22.635 --> 01:10:25.512
No, no, no. The scroll is purely decorative.

01:10:26.389 --> 01:10:30.809
Many instruments at this time
had a graft. Here.

01:10:37.025 --> 01:10:40.569
The old violins had a shorter neck

01:10:40.653 --> 01:10:43.822
and the angle of the fingerboard
was different,

01:10:43.907 --> 01:10:46.992
and then when the new style
was introduced,

01:10:47.994 --> 01:10:51.204
a cut was made here.

01:10:51.831 --> 01:10:57.169
This way the scroll could be kept
while the neck was being worked on.

01:11:00.048 --> 01:11:01.465
Can you...

01:11:04.302 --> 01:11:08.597
I've made some drawings

01:11:08.681 --> 01:11:12.017
on how I can reconstruct this.

01:11:13.227 --> 01:11:14.561
With what?

01:11:15.355 --> 01:11:16.939
I... Okay.

01:11:26.783 --> 01:11:31.662
I... I brought this with me from Paris.

01:11:33.164 --> 01:11:36.208
It was attached to an old violin

01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:38.460
that was destroyed during the war.

01:11:39.128 --> 01:11:41.922
-The same make?
-No, it's part of the same workshop.

01:11:42.006 --> 01:11:44.675
This would make the scroll identical.

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:50.138
I can attach this to your violin.

01:11:52.433 --> 01:11:53.642
Here.

01:11:54.936 --> 01:11:56.728
Look at the drawing.

01:11:58.648 --> 01:11:59.648
See?

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:03.151
It would be like this.

01:12:03.861 --> 01:12:06.613
But in the end, it would be smooth.

01:12:06.906 --> 01:12:09.825
You feel it? Smooth.

01:12:52.952 --> 01:12:55.370
Your mother plays like a goddess.

01:12:59.083 --> 01:13:01.710
How long have you been standing there?

01:13:03.546 --> 01:13:05.589
He wants us in for dinner.

01:13:09.927 --> 01:13:10.969
Hi.

01:13:17.727 --> 01:13:19.728
Don't make a scene, okay?

01:13:20.438 --> 01:13:21.813
About what?

01:13:22.023 --> 01:13:25.025
He says anything during grace or anything...

01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:29.988
I'm a guest. I expect to be treated like one.

01:13:41.209 --> 01:13:43.126
-You said they were all animals.
-No, no, no, no, no.

01:13:43.211 --> 01:13:44.753
The people who took over the airplanes,

01:13:44.837 --> 01:13:48.048
the people who crashed them
into the two towers, they were animals.

01:13:48.132 --> 01:13:49.966
You said all of us.

01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:53.053
-Was that what I said?
-Yes.

01:13:54.347 --> 01:13:56.473
Tom, is that what I just said?

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:03.563
Tom, I'm asking you a question.
Is that what I told your brother-in-law?

01:14:03.648 --> 01:14:05.524
I don't know. I don't know, Dad.

01:14:05.608 --> 01:14:06.858
You don't know.

01:14:06.943 --> 01:14:08.693
You're sitting across the table from me
and you don't know.

01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:11.696
Is there a problem with your hearing, Tom?

01:14:12.156 --> 01:14:15.283
I'll tell you why I wouldn't have said
anything like that.

01:14:15.368 --> 01:14:17.452
Why I know I couldn't have said
anything like that,

01:14:17.537 --> 01:14:20.747
because, contrary to what you may think,

01:14:21.749 --> 01:14:23.625
I'm a civilized man.

01:14:24.210 --> 01:14:28.004
And civilized people don't believe
in doing things like that.

01:14:28.422 --> 01:14:31.800
-You always change the story.
-What story?

01:14:31.884 --> 01:14:33.677
You are a snaky man.

01:14:36.222 --> 01:14:39.891
Did he mean sneaky, Rachel?
Is that what your husband is calling me?

01:14:40.101 --> 01:14:45.147
Your husband wants to know what's wrong
with raising my grandson with his culture,

01:14:45.231 --> 01:14:48.316
and I was explaining that what's wrong is

01:14:49.277 --> 01:14:52.487
that his culture's brought nothing
but hatred and violence into this world.

01:14:52.572 --> 01:14:55.574
You say this after the Crusades?

01:14:56.159 --> 01:14:58.952
-After you sent children to fight?
-What's he talking about?

01:14:59.036 --> 01:15:01.872
-The Crusade of Children.
-Oh, yeah, yes, yes, yeah.

01:15:01.956 --> 01:15:04.166
You're an educated man, aren't you, Sami?

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:07.794
What do you make of this educated man,
Tom? Does he impress you?

01:15:09.046 --> 01:15:13.175
She was drinking a lot.
She always did in those situations.

01:15:13.551 --> 01:15:15.552
What situations?

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:18.638
When Dad and him were together.

01:15:19.557 --> 01:15:22.225
-Sami?
-Yes.

01:15:23.269 --> 01:15:25.145
You don't use his name.

01:15:25.897 --> 01:15:28.148
I didn't get to know him that well.

01:15:28.232 --> 01:15:30.942
He lived with your sister for 10 years.

01:15:32.653 --> 01:15:35.197
I wasn't around very much back then.

01:15:36.824 --> 01:15:38.366
Where were you?

01:15:43.331 --> 01:15:44.539
Listen.

01:15:51.505 --> 01:15:54.966
I wish I did get to know him better, Sami.

01:15:56.302 --> 01:15:58.553
I could tell Simon who he was.

01:15:59.263 --> 01:16:02.307
He needs to know that.
I want him to know that.

01:16:03.809 --> 01:16:05.810
Instead he got my father,

01:16:06.729 --> 01:16:09.064
the same shit I was raised with.

01:16:10.524 --> 01:16:14.069
Except your sister made sure
he wasn't raised with that,

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:18.698
that you looked after him,
that you raised Simon.

01:16:21.786 --> 01:16:24.996
My son doesn't answer
because he agrees with me.

01:16:25.081 --> 01:16:28.458
He doesn't want to seem impolite
because that's not the way he was raised.

01:16:28.542 --> 01:16:30.961
The first thing you need to know
is that this family knows its place,

01:16:31.045 --> 01:16:33.255
and its place isn't to tell me what I said
or didn't say.

01:16:33.339 --> 01:16:36.591
Their place isn't to sit at my table
and ask me to explain myself.

01:16:36.676 --> 01:16:40.762
Because the way my children were raised,
this would be considered rude.

01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:44.266
Do you understand that?

01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:49.980
Maybe it's normal for you to act this way,

01:16:50.356 --> 01:16:53.692
to be heated, hot-blooded, impassioned,

01:16:53.859 --> 01:16:58.405
rude across the family table,
but in my house this is not acceptable.

01:16:58.864 --> 01:17:01.574
-When Rachel's mother was alive...
-Hey, Simon.

01:17:01.659 --> 01:17:03.159
...she had a rule...

01:17:03.244 --> 01:17:06.538
-Want to go out for a ride in my truck?
-...whenever anyone got angry at this table

01:17:06.622 --> 01:17:08.915
or anywhere...

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.501
-Okay.
-...she would nod.

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:24.139
-You don't talk...
-Tom.

01:17:24.223 --> 01:17:26.975
Tom, come back. Please come back now.

01:17:27.059 --> 01:17:29.477
After she spent the whole week
making this meal,

01:17:29.562 --> 01:17:30.854
do you like to see her drinking?

01:17:30.938 --> 01:17:32.105
-You have no idea...
-No! No!

01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:34.649
-...what you're talking about.
-You make her do this.

01:17:34.734 --> 01:17:36.026
She is miserable here.

01:17:36.110 --> 01:17:37.902
You make her miserable here!

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:41.906
Come, please come. Tom, can you hear me?

01:17:41.991 --> 01:17:43.366
-...who's civilized!
-Tom, can you hear me?

01:17:43.451 --> 01:17:45.076
Please, just come back!

01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:49.497
Tom, just come back.
Please, just come back.

01:17:49.582 --> 01:17:51.124
...you don't talk!

01:18:03.346 --> 01:18:04.929
I pretended I couldn't hear,

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:08.350
that the connection was bad.

01:18:09.101 --> 01:18:11.102
And she kept calling.

01:18:11.771 --> 01:18:13.605
And I didn't pick up.

01:18:15.941 --> 01:18:17.275
Why not?

01:18:19.111 --> 01:18:21.696
Because someone
was finally giving it to him.

01:18:21.781 --> 01:18:25.533
No one had ever stood up to him
like that, confronted him like that.

01:18:25.618 --> 01:18:28.620
I wanted him to explode for me.

01:18:32.083 --> 01:18:34.417
That's what I wanted Sami to do.

01:18:37.088 --> 01:18:40.965
-Explode?
-Yes.

01:18:44.804 --> 01:18:47.555
-How long did it last?
-I don't know.

01:18:49.141 --> 01:18:52.352
He must have seen
that she was too drunk to drive.

01:18:55.564 --> 01:18:59.526
I know... I know it's not my fault.

01:19:00.986 --> 01:19:02.987
But it is your fault.

01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:06.991
You didn't answer her call for help.

01:19:07.076 --> 01:19:09.577
If you had driven back,
you could have taken them home.

01:19:09.662 --> 01:19:11.996
Sami wouldn't have had to drive.

01:19:16.794 --> 01:19:21.047
You have lived with this far too long
to deny your responsibility.

01:19:25.845 --> 01:19:28.763
When I got back it was done.
They were gone.

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:34.936
I walked in, my father's screaming
that he did it on purpose.

01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:36.104
Okay?

01:19:36.564 --> 01:19:38.273
That he killed himself and Rachel.

01:19:38.357 --> 01:19:42.318
That he called from the car and said
he was going to kill himself and Rachel.

01:19:42.403 --> 01:19:44.696
-Why?
-'Cause he was a monster.

01:19:45.948 --> 01:19:50.452
That's what my dad always thought,
and now there's no one to disprove him.

01:19:53.497 --> 01:19:54.581
Okay?

01:19:56.167 --> 01:19:59.878
But Sami was not a monster.

01:20:01.464 --> 01:20:02.547
No.

01:20:04.341 --> 01:20:05.550
Not him.

01:21:24.213 --> 01:21:27.131
How long have you known
that Simon was their child?

01:21:27.383 --> 01:21:30.009
The moment I was transferred to the school.

01:21:30.761 --> 01:21:33.137
The moment I saw his last name.

01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:40.645
It became my secret.

01:21:45.067 --> 01:21:46.651
Does Simon know?

01:21:48.571 --> 01:21:49.612
No.

01:21:56.579 --> 01:21:58.329
I watched him grow.

01:22:00.791 --> 01:22:04.335
I always saw him as Sami's child.

01:22:04.712 --> 01:22:07.672
Not the way he looks. His manner.

01:22:11.343 --> 01:22:17.432
These things became
much more complicated as Simon grew.

01:22:18.851 --> 01:22:22.520
And that's when you decided
to visit his house.

01:22:23.355 --> 01:22:25.064
I used to drive by.

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:31.279
I would watch him inside,
playing with Simon, cooking.

01:22:31.363 --> 01:22:33.323
He was a great cook.

01:22:40.289 --> 01:22:43.833
I watched him put up
the Christmas decorations.

01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:47.211
That was very generous of him,

01:22:48.839 --> 01:22:51.299
coming from the upbringing he had.

01:22:58.682 --> 01:23:02.143
I'm sorry. I should have never done that,

01:23:02.811 --> 01:23:04.812
come to the house.

01:23:06.106 --> 01:23:08.149
What were you expecting to find?

01:23:10.152 --> 01:23:11.778
I don't know.

01:23:13.906 --> 01:23:15.239
I don't.

01:23:30.756 --> 01:23:32.340
Thanks, man.

01:26:25.472 --> 01:26:27.765
You can sell the violin now, Tom.

01:26:28.725 --> 01:26:30.643
You have my permission.

01:26:34.606 --> 01:26:37.775
Remember when I asked you
about cutting the scroll off?

01:26:39.152 --> 01:26:42.780
Well, it's something that I had to do.

01:26:43.282 --> 01:26:46.158
It's kind of hard to describe why.

01:26:47.786 --> 01:26:51.205
I don't think it'll affect the value very much

01:26:51.623 --> 01:26:54.959
since it doesn't change the sound.

01:26:56.169 --> 01:26:59.088
I hope it'll pay for all the things
that we'll need.

01:27:59.566 --> 01:28:01.776
I'm going to the Holy Land.

01:28:02.402 --> 01:28:04.195
It's all the Holy Land.

01:28:13.038 --> 01:28:15.164
I can feel the baby kicking.

01:28:40.399 --> 01:28:44.068
Grandpa, I really need to know
what happened that night.

01:28:44.945 --> 01:28:47.071
He was going to kill her.

01:28:49.074 --> 01:28:52.785
-He called and said...
-He could have called to apologize

01:28:52.869 --> 01:28:56.706
or to find out if I was back.
Or it could have been my mother.

01:30:04.066 --> 01:30:06.067
Would you like to come in?

01:30:07.778 --> 01:30:09.195
For coffee?

01:30:12.491 --> 01:30:15.659
Must be strange
to see those wedding photographs.

01:30:16.328 --> 01:30:18.454
He never said he wasn't married.

01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:21.707
It's part of the reason
my dad was so suspicious of him.

01:30:22.375 --> 01:30:26.796
-If he could do that to me...
-That sort of idea, yeah.

01:30:28.381 --> 01:30:31.092
Except your father did not know me.

01:30:31.384 --> 01:30:35.179
If he did, maybe he would understand
what Sami was running away from.

01:30:35.347 --> 01:30:37.348
What do you mean?

01:30:38.350 --> 01:30:42.186
-I have strange ways.
-Yes, you do.

01:30:43.855 --> 01:30:46.273
You thought I was crazy. You thought...

01:30:46.358 --> 01:30:51.195
You told Simon that people dressed like me
don't come to your part of town.

01:30:52.572 --> 01:30:56.242
-You had him record the conversation?
-He told me about it.

01:30:58.036 --> 01:31:01.580
You were testing me to see if I'd explode.

01:31:02.374 --> 01:31:03.541
Yeah?

01:31:04.584 --> 01:31:07.878
-And you refused to let that happen.
-Yeah. Not in front of Simon.

01:31:08.630 --> 01:31:12.174
And if Simon wasn't there,
would you have beaten me?

01:31:12.259 --> 01:31:15.886
-Like you attacked that man today?
-He was going to vomit on us.

01:31:18.807 --> 01:31:22.476
What if I did that now?

01:31:23.520 --> 01:31:25.646
Hey. Stop it.

01:31:30.485 --> 01:31:32.903
Do you think I would do that?

01:31:32.988 --> 01:31:37.366
-Vomit on my own rug to prove a point?
-I'm not sure.

01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:40.911
You must think I'm capable of anything.

01:31:42.247 --> 01:31:44.999
Isn't it best to stay away
from people like me?

01:31:48.879 --> 01:31:50.045
Maybe.

01:31:51.089 --> 01:31:54.258
Except people like me are everywhere,

01:31:55.051 --> 01:31:57.803
people who are capable of anything,

01:31:58.305 --> 01:32:02.766
capable of seeking justice, seeking revenge.

01:32:03.518 --> 01:32:07.688
-For what?
-I lost my entire family in Lebanon.

01:32:08.190 --> 01:32:13.235
One day I came back home from school
and they were wiped out, just like that.

01:32:18.200 --> 01:32:20.075
Sami was my salvation.

01:32:22.245 --> 01:32:26.290
He provided me
with something I could believe in.

01:32:29.794 --> 01:32:32.421
I don't know what you expect from us.

01:32:35.926 --> 01:32:38.761
I would like to be a part of Simon's life.

01:32:41.890 --> 01:32:42.973
Why?

01:32:44.142 --> 01:32:45.726
He's all I have.

01:32:48.647 --> 01:32:51.732
I was never upset at my husband
for leaving me.

01:32:52.817 --> 01:32:54.610
I can't explain why.

01:32:56.071 --> 01:32:58.489
Your sister was from such a different world,

01:32:58.573 --> 01:33:00.574
and she gave him a child.

01:33:01.868 --> 01:33:03.661
Sami wanted a child.

01:33:14.297 --> 01:33:17.633
You're going to have to pay for the ticket.
The tow was free.

01:33:33.942 --> 01:33:35.192
Grandpa.

01:33:35.902 --> 01:33:39.196
I really need to know
what happened that night.

01:33:39.614 --> 01:33:41.824
He was going to kill her.

01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:47.579
-He called and said...
-He could have called to apologize

01:33:47.664 --> 01:33:51.333
or to find out if I was back.
It could have been my mother calling.

01:33:55.547 --> 01:33:58.340
You have to believe me, Simon.

01:34:00.093 --> 01:34:02.261
Your father was a killer.

01:35:04.783 --> 01:35:07.785
Why didn't you tell me about this before?

01:35:11.623 --> 01:35:14.625
I didn't think it was appropriate.

01:35:16.294 --> 01:35:17.961
Yeah, good call.

01:35:20.298 --> 01:35:22.007
He looked happy.

01:35:24.344 --> 01:35:25.552
He was.

01:35:26.638 --> 01:35:28.138
We were happy.

01:35:30.058 --> 01:35:31.975
And then what happened?

01:35:33.895 --> 01:35:35.687
Then he met your mom.

01:35:37.190 --> 01:35:38.732
You let him go.

01:35:39.234 --> 01:35:40.275
No.

01:35:41.653 --> 01:35:43.362
I never let him go.
