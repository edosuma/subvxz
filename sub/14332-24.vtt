08:38.717 --> 08:41.953
- [whispering]

08:45.591 --> 08:48.494
- AWW, THAT'S SWEET.

08:48.561 --> 08:50.296
- YOU MAY HAVE WON THIS ROUND,

08:50.363 --> 08:54.000
BUT I WILL STOP AT NOTHING
TO WIN WANDA'S LOVE.

08:54.066 --> 08:58.504
I SWEAR I WILL HAVE
MY REVENGE-ISSIMO.

08:58.571 --> 08:59.739
- DID YOU SEE THAT?

08:59.805 --> 09:02.308
I THINK WE HAVE
OUR FIRST SUSPECT.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.176
- YOU MEAN THE PINK-HAIRED GIRL?

09:04.243 --> 09:06.679
THERE ALWAYS WAS SOMETHING FISHY
ABOUT HER.

09:06.746 --> 09:09.649
MAYBE BECAUSE I PUT MY BASS
IN HER BACKPACK.

09:09.715 --> 09:11.751
- NO, I'M TALKING ABOUT
JUANDISSIMO.

09:11.817 --> 09:13.352
MAYBE HE TOOK YOUR PAPER.

09:13.419 --> 09:14.387
- I DON'T KNOW, TIMMY.

09:14.453 --> 09:17.523
I THINK WE SHOULD KEEP WATCHING.

09:17.590 --> 09:20.226
- I'M PROFESSOR AL LAKAZAM.
IN THIS CLASS

09:20.293 --> 09:21.994
YOU'LL LEARN HOW TO DISGUISE
YOURSELF FROM HUMANS

09:22.061 --> 09:23.763
WHO AREN'T YOUR FAIRY GODKIDS.

09:23.829 --> 09:26.832
- WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THIS
DISGUISE, TEACH?

09:26.899 --> 09:28.601
[roars]

09:28.668 --> 09:31.704
- [screams]

09:31.771 --> 09:33.406
OH, LOOK WHAT YOU'VE MADE ME DO.

09:33.472 --> 09:36.709
NOW WHOEVER I HIT WITH MY ARROW
WILL FALL IN LOVE WITH ME.

09:36.776 --> 09:38.344
[monkey chattering]

09:38.411 --> 09:40.513
OH, NO.
IT'S WET WILLY!

09:40.579 --> 09:43.015
NO, YOUR BREATH SMELLS
LIKE BANANAS.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.251
OH, I'LL GET YOU FOR THIS,
COSMO!

09:45.318 --> 09:47.253
[monkey screeching]
AAH!

09:47.320 --> 09:50.056
- CHECK IT OUT.
SUSPECT NUMBER TWO.

09:50.122 --> 09:52.959
- YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.
IT'S CLEARLY THE MONKEY.

09:53.025 --> 09:55.127
- TIMMY'S TALKING ABOUT CUPID.

09:55.194 --> 09:56.629
- TIMMY'S NOT EVEN HERE.

09:56.696 --> 09:57.964
HE'S OUTSIDE WITH HIS DAD

09:58.030 --> 09:59.465
SHARPENING HIS TEETH
ON A SAPLING.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.100
[chomping]

10:01.167 --> 10:02.768
- I DON'T KNOW
WHY WE'RE DOING THIS,

10:02.835 --> 10:04.737
BUT AT LEAST
I'M GETTING FIBER IN MY DIET.

10:04.804 --> 10:07.039
- ANYWAY, I'M PRETTY SURE
IT WASN'T CUPID.

10:07.106 --> 10:09.241
LET'S CHECK OUT MY NEXT CLASS.

10:09.308 --> 10:14.046
ODDS ARE
I MADE AN ENEMY IN THERE, TOO.

10:14.113 --> 10:15.247
- WELCOME, CLASS.

10:15.314 --> 10:17.283
I'M PROFESSOR GRANT AWISH

10:17.350 --> 10:19.785
AND I'LL BE TEACHING YOU
<i>DA RULES OF FAIRY GODPARENTING.</i>

10:19.852 --> 10:21.420
THERE ARE SEVERAL RULES

10:21.487 --> 10:24.090
YOU CAN'T LET
YOUR FAIRY GODKIDS VIOLATE.

10:24.156 --> 10:25.558
DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT THEY ARE?

10:25.624 --> 10:27.660
- YOU CAN'T TAKE
WHAT'S NOT YOURS.

10:27.727 --> 10:30.129
- THAT'S NOT IN THE BOOK,
BUT IT'S A GOOD RULE TO LIVE BY.

10:30.196 --> 10:32.631
- ACTUALLY, I WAS TALKING
TO THE CREEPY CLOWN.

10:32.698 --> 10:34.233
HE TOOK MY WALLET.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.901
- I NEED GAS MONEY
FOR MY CLOWN CAR.

10:35.968 --> 10:38.337
THE OTHER 40 CLOWNS
WOULDN'T PITCH IN.

10:38.404 --> 10:40.006
- I KNOW A RULE.

10:40.072 --> 10:43.642
IF A GODKID KICKS SAND
IN YOUR FACE AT THE BEACH,

10:43.709 --> 10:45.144
YOU CRY LIKE A BABY.

10:45.211 --> 10:46.979
- BOY, WHAT A WIMP.

10:47.046 --> 10:48.414
- I HEARD THAT.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.082
I WOULD SAY,
"LET'S STEP OUTSIDE"

10:50.149 --> 10:52.451
BUT MY ALLERGIES ARE TERRIBLE.

10:52.518 --> 10:56.422
I'LL GET MY REVENGE IN THE FALL
WHEN THE POLLEN COUNT DROPS.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.825
[inhales]

10:59.892 --> 11:02.428
- GUYS,
WE HAVE YET ANOTHER SUSPECT.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.163
- YOU MEAN THE CREEPY CLOWN?

11:04.230 --> 11:06.198
HE TOOK MY WALLET,
BUT HE DIDN'T TAKE MY PAPER.

11:06.265 --> 11:07.833
JOKE'S ON HIM.

11:07.900 --> 11:11.337
ALL I HAD IN THERE WERE MORE
CARPET CLEANING COUPONS.

11:11.404 --> 11:12.972
- GOOD NEWS, EVERYONE.

11:13.039 --> 11:15.307
- YOU'RE GONNA LET COSMO
OFF THE HOOK?

11:15.374 --> 11:16.842
- NO.
I PHOTOSHOPPED MY PICTURE

11:16.909 --> 11:19.311
IN THE YEARBOOK,
AND NOW I LOOK FANTASTIC.

11:19.378 --> 11:20.846
IN LESS HAPPY NEWS,

11:20.913 --> 11:24.050
COSMO, YOU ONLY HAVE 15 MINUTES
TO FIGURE OUT

11:24.116 --> 11:25.451
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR PAPER.

11:25.518 --> 11:27.286
IT IS THE START
OF A LONG WEEKEND,

11:27.353 --> 11:30.189
AND THE FAIRY COUNCIL WANTS
TO GET A JUMP ON THE TRAFFIC.

11:30.256 --> 11:33.192
- OH, NO, COSMO!
WE GOTTA DO SOMETHING FAST

11:33.259 --> 11:36.028
OR I'LL LOSE YOU AND WANDA
AS MY FAIRY GODPARENTS.

11:36.095 --> 11:37.696
- ♪ BUM BUM BUM! ♪

11:37.763 --> 11:39.698
WAIT, THAT'S NOT GOOD.

11:44.804 --> 11:47.406
- THIS IS TERRIBLE.
WHAT AM I GONNA DO?

11:47.473 --> 11:50.209
IT'S THE LONG WEEKEND,
AND I DON'T HAVE ANY PLANS.

11:50.276 --> 11:53.679
ALTHOUGH, I WAS THINKING ABOUT
A LOVELY DRIVE UP THE COAST.

11:53.746 --> 11:56.182
OR MAYBE JUST CATCHING A MOVIE.
WHAT'S GOOD LATELY?

11:56.248 --> 11:58.250
- I WOULD BE MORE CONCERNED
ABOUT THE FACT

11:58.317 --> 12:00.386
THAT YOUR CAREER
AS A FAIRY GODPARENT

12:00.453 --> 12:03.155
WILL BE OVER IN
14 MINUTES AND 30 SECONDS.

12:03.222 --> 12:04.857
- BUT JORGEN, WE HAVE PROOF

12:04.924 --> 12:08.327
THAT SOMEONE STOLE
COSMO'S FINAL PAPER.

12:08.394 --> 12:11.163
- REALLY?
LET US SEE IT.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.231
[device beeps]

12:14.800 --> 12:16.035
OF COURSE.

12:16.102 --> 12:18.204
THAT GLITCHY,
STICKY IMAGE OF NOTHING

12:18.270 --> 12:20.539
WILL TOTALLY GET YOU
OFF THE HOOK.

12:20.606 --> 12:21.574
- YAY!

12:21.640 --> 12:23.175
- I WAS BEING SARCASTIC.

12:23.242 --> 12:24.910
- WELL, THAT MAKES SENSE.

12:24.977 --> 12:28.047
I WAS ALSO VOTED MOST LIKELY
TO NOT UNDERSTAND SARCASM.

12:28.114 --> 12:29.715
- JORGEN, IT'S MY FAULT.

12:29.782 --> 12:32.685
I ACCIDENTALLY SPIT APPLE JUICE
ALL OVER THE MEMORY.

12:32.751 --> 12:34.787
- TOO BAD!
NOT ONLY DID YOU MISS OUT

12:34.854 --> 12:37.590
ON THE HEALTHY AND NUTRITIONAL
BENEFITS OF APPLE JUICE,

12:37.656 --> 12:41.594
YOU NOW ONLY HAVE 11 MINUTES AND
28 SECONDS TO FIND REAL PROOF

12:41.660 --> 12:43.729
THAT COSMO TURNED IN HIS PAPER.

12:43.796 --> 12:45.598
NOW IF YOU WILL EXCUSE ME,

12:45.664 --> 12:47.900
I HAVE TO PHOTOSHOP
MY MUSCULAR BODY

12:47.967 --> 12:51.770
INTO A FEW THOUSAND
MORE YEARBOOKS.

12:51.837 --> 12:53.706
- GUYS, IF WE WANNA SAVE COSMO,

12:53.772 --> 12:55.875
WE GOTTA FIGURE OUT
WHO STOLE THAT PAPER.

12:55.941 --> 12:59.211
- IT'S GOTTA BE EITHER
JUANDISSIMO, CUPID, OR JORGEN.

12:59.278 --> 13:01.447
LET'S SEE IF WE CAN FIND
ANYTHING IN COSMO'S MEMORIES

13:01.514 --> 13:03.749
THAT PROVES
WHICH ONE OF THEM DID IT.

13:03.816 --> 13:05.251
LET'S CHECK OUT JORGEN FIRST.

13:05.317 --> 13:06.785
HE MAY BE THE ONE
BEHIND ALL THIS

13:06.852 --> 13:08.721
AND THAT'S WHY
HE'S RAILROADING YOU.

13:08.787 --> 13:10.389
- THAT MAKES SENSE.

13:10.456 --> 13:12.925
JORGEN WAS VOTED MOST LIKELY
TO WORK ON A RAILROAD.

13:12.992 --> 13:14.793
OR GET THROWN IN FRONT
OF A TRAIN.

13:14.860 --> 13:17.163
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

13:17.229 --> 13:21.000
[whimsical music]

13:21.066 --> 13:22.301
- [sighs]

13:22.368 --> 13:25.304
LOOK AT HER.
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

13:25.371 --> 13:27.106
- WHO?
THE PINK-HAIRED GIRL?

13:27.173 --> 13:29.141
SORRY, BRO.
SHE'S MINE.

13:29.208 --> 13:31.310
LOOK AT HER
BATTING HER EYELASHES AT ME.

13:31.377 --> 13:32.811
NOPE, I'M WRONG.

13:32.878 --> 13:35.347
I ACCIDENTALLY SQUIRTED
HOT SAUCE IN HER EYES.

13:35.414 --> 13:38.417
- [crying]
OW, IT BURNS!

13:38.484 --> 13:39.585
AHH.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.687
- SORRY, PINK-HAIRED GIRL.

13:41.754 --> 13:42.922
- AH!

13:42.988 --> 13:44.590
- YOU NINNY.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.592
I WAS TALKING ABOUT
THE TOOTH FAIRY.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.460
I WOULD LOVE TO WOO HER,

13:48.527 --> 13:52.531
BUT SHE WOULD NEVER GO FOR
A SCRAWNY LITTLE WIMP LIKE ME.

13:52.598 --> 13:53.966
SEE THAT?

13:54.033 --> 13:56.435
PEOPLE BRING THEIR OWN SAND
TO SCHOOL

13:56.502 --> 13:58.370
JUST TO KICK IT IN MY FACE.

13:58.437 --> 14:03.609
IF ONLY I WAS STRONG, POWERFUL,
AND CARRIED A BIG WAND.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.845
I BET THE TOOTH FAIRY
WOULD NOTICE ME THEN.

14:06.912 --> 14:09.515
- JORGEN, THE TOOTH FAIRY'S
NOT INTO BICEPS,

14:09.582 --> 14:11.150
SHE'S INTO BICUSPIDS.

14:11.217 --> 14:14.453
AND I KNOW JUST HOW TO GET HER
TO NOTICE YOU.

14:21.026 --> 14:23.229
- WHAT A HANDSOME BICUSPID.

14:23.295 --> 14:24.997
HERE'S A DOLLAR, HOT STUFF.

14:25.064 --> 14:28.367
AS LONG AS YOU PLAN ON SPENDING
IT ON ME, SATURDAY NIGHT.

14:28.434 --> 14:30.236
- COSMO, THANK YOU.

14:30.302 --> 14:32.204
I AM SWOONING.

14:32.271 --> 14:35.507
OF COURSE, THAT COULD BE FROM
THE FRYING PAN TO THE NOGGIN.

14:35.574 --> 14:38.244
ANYWAY, YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND
AND I OWE YOU ONE.

14:38.310 --> 14:39.912

14:39.979 --> 14:41.714
UGH!

14:41.780 --> 14:43.983
- SO JORGEN ACTUALLY LIKED YOU.

14:44.049 --> 14:45.751
I GUESS THAT RULES HIM OUT.

14:45.818 --> 14:46.986
[whack]
OW!

14:47.052 --> 14:48.887
- HEY!
BEAVER IN TIMMY'S ROOM!

14:48.954 --> 14:50.489
THROW US THAT BALL.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.925
I'M TRYING TO PLAY PING-PONG
WITH MY SON.

14:52.992 --> 14:54.693
- FINE.

14:54.760 --> 14:55.928
- THANKS.

14:57.496 --> 14:58.697
HA!

15:00.666 --> 15:03.269
OH, NICE BUTTHAND SMASH!

15:03.335 --> 15:05.104
- GUYS, WE HAVE
8 1/2 MINUTES LEFT.

15:05.170 --> 15:07.072
LET'S CHECK OUT
THE NEXT SUSPECT.

[device beeps]

15:10.109 --> 15:13.846
- [sobbing]

15:13.912 --> 15:16.949
- CUPID, WHAT ARE YOU DOING
CRYING INSIDE YOUR LOCKER?

15:17.016 --> 15:19.218
DID YOU AND WET WILLY BREAK UP?

15:19.285 --> 15:21.920
- YEAH, HE DUMPED ME FOR A LEMUR
WITH A SPORTS CAR.

15:21.987 --> 15:25.057
- LET'S STAY FRIENDS.
TEXT ME.

15:25.124 --> 15:26.925
- BUT THAT'S NOT WHY I'M CRYING.

15:26.992 --> 15:29.428
MY PROBLEM IS I'M SUPPOSED TO
SHOOT LOVE ARROWS AT PEOPLE,

15:29.495 --> 15:31.096
BUT I HAVE TERRIBLE AIM.

15:31.163 --> 15:32.631
WATCH THIS.

15:35.367 --> 15:37.102
SEE?
I'M ATROCIOUS!

15:37.169 --> 15:40.039
MY ARROW MISSED THE TARGET
AND FLEW INTO THE CAFETERIA.

15:40.105 --> 15:42.574
[thwack]
- I'M IN LOVE WITH MY FRUIT CUP.

15:42.641 --> 15:44.576
- FACE IT, I'M A TOTAL LOSER.

15:44.643 --> 15:46.445
UGH, IF THIS KEEPS UP,
I'LL NEVER FULFILL

15:46.512 --> 15:49.948
MY ODDLY SPECIFIC DREAM OF BEING
A MATCHMAKER IN A DIAPER.

15:50.015 --> 15:53.585
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO?

15:53.652 --> 15:57.122
- WELL, THERE'S YOUR PROBLEM.
YOU'RE CROSS-EYED.

16:03.729 --> 16:07.466
- WOW,
NOW THERE'S ONLY ONE OF YOU.

16:07.533 --> 16:08.600
[ping]
- I JUST BROKE UP

16:08.667 --> 16:10.302
WITH MY FRUIT CUP.

16:10.369 --> 16:13.505
AND NOW I'M IN LOVE WITH
SOMEONE FROM MY OWN SPECIES.

16:13.572 --> 16:15.908
- I DID IT!
MY AIM IS TRUE.

16:15.974 --> 16:18.410
THANKS, COSMO.
YOU'RE MY BFF.

16:18.477 --> 16:21.413
BEST FAIRY FRIEND EVER.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.350
- WELL, COSMO, THERE'S NO WAY
CUPID TOOK YOUR PAPER.

16:24.416 --> 16:26.919
THE ONLY SUSPECT LEFT
IS JUANDISSIMO.

16:29.321 --> 16:33.359
- YOU ARE SO BEAUTIFUL THAT YOU
GIVE THE SUN A REASON TO SHINE.

16:33.425 --> 16:35.127
CAN YOU GIVE ME DIRECTIONS
TO YOUR HEART?

16:35.194 --> 16:38.931
I SEEM TO HAVE LOST MYSELF
IN YOUR EYES.

16:38.997 --> 16:40.999
AND PINK-HAIRED GIRL,
YOU ARE NOT SO BAD YOURSELF.

16:41.066 --> 16:43.802
HOW ABOUT WE GO
INTO THE JANITOR'S CLOSET?

16:43.869 --> 16:44.870
- WHAT?

16:44.937 --> 16:46.105
- THERE IS A MIRROR IN THERE

16:46.171 --> 16:47.706
BIG ENOUGH FOR BOTH OF US

16:47.773 --> 16:49.274
TO ADMIRE ME.

16:52.044 --> 16:53.645
- DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY,

16:53.712 --> 16:56.348
BUT YOU GET AWAY FROM ME,
YOU CONCEITED JERK!

16:56.415 --> 16:57.616
- BUT DON'T YOU SEE?

16:57.683 --> 17:00.319
I CANNOT GET YOU OUT OF MY HEAD.

17:00.386 --> 17:02.888
- I'LL GET HER OUT OF YOUR HEAD.

17:02.955 --> 17:04.123
[whomp]

17:04.189 --> 17:05.290
- [voice echoes]
HUEVOS RANCHEROS!

17:05.357 --> 17:06.692
- LEAVE WHAT'S-HER-NAME ALONE.

17:06.759 --> 17:08.193
SHE'S MY GIRL.

17:08.260 --> 17:11.363
- OH, COSMO.
THAT'S SO ROMANTIC.

17:11.430 --> 17:14.566
I'VE HAD A CRUSH ON YOU
SINCE THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.

17:14.633 --> 17:16.667
MY NAME IS WANDA, BY THE WAY.

17:16.734 --> 17:18.837
- WELL, WANDA-BY-THE-WAY,
WHAT DO YOU SAY

17:18.904 --> 17:20.472
WE GO TO THE SCHOOL DANCE?

17:20.539 --> 17:22.141
- THAT WOULD BE FUN.

17:22.207 --> 17:27.311
WE COULD DOUBLE DATE
WITH WET WILLY AND THE LEMUR.

17:27.378 --> 17:29.214
- SORRY ABOUT THE FRYING PAN,
JUANDISSIMO.

17:29.281 --> 17:30.983
- APOLOGY ACCEPTED.

17:31.049 --> 17:34.586
IN FACT, I ADMIRE YOUR PASSION
FOR WANDA-BY-THE-WAY.

17:34.653 --> 17:37.055
YOU MADE ME REALIZE
WHAT TRUE LOVE IS,

17:37.122 --> 17:38.724
AND ALSO
THAT I AM MORE INTERESTED

17:38.791 --> 17:40.592
IN MEANINGLESS FLINGS.

17:40.659 --> 17:43.228
YOU HAVE GIVEN ME
A WONDERFUL GIFT.

17:43.295 --> 17:44.263
- WISDOM?

17:44.329 --> 17:46.265
- NO.
THIS FRYING PAN
