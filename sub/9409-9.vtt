[ Man]
Goosebumps.

You're in for a scare.

[ Chuckles ]

01:17.167 --> 01:20.333
[ Narrating ] I'm here in Egypt
visiting my Uncle Ben and Cousin Sari.

01:20.333 --> 01:22.767
My Uncle Ben's an archaeologist.

01:22.767 --> 01:28.267
He's really cool. He knows all
about ancient civilizations.

01:28.267 --> 01:30.767
My Cousin Sari thinks
she knows a lot...

01:30.767 --> 01:33.267
but she's okay.

01:34.267 --> 01:36.667
We're on the site of a secret dig.

01:36.667 --> 01:38.500
My uncle has discovered
a pyramid that is

01:38.500 --> 01:41.500
the tomb of an ancient Egyptian prince.

01:41.500 --> 01:44.500
The pyramid is like
this dark underground maze...

01:44.500 --> 01:47.000
full of secret passages
and dead ends.

01:47.000 --> 01:50.000
It's pretty spooky,
but I'm not afraid.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.300
I'm psyched that I get to be
one of the first people inside--

01:53.300 --> 01:56.300
The tomb of Prince Horu--
or at least we hope it is.

01:56.300 --> 01:59.300
If it is, you'll be famous, Dad.

01:59.300 --> 02:01.800
And there's a real mummy in here?

02:01.800 --> 02:05.300
Duh!
That's why they built it, Gabe.

02:05.933 --> 02:07.867
What's this?

02:09.400 --> 02:11.333
Hey, give me that!

02:11.333 --> 02:13.833
It's my summoner.
I bought it at the airport.

02:13.833 --> 02:15.333
Uh, a summoner?

02:15.833 --> 02:18.567
The guy said it can
call forth the dead.

02:18.567 --> 02:20.567
He said it was
a real mummy's hand.

02:20.567 --> 02:22.433
[ Ben ]
I hope you didn't pay too much.

02:22.433 --> 02:25.333
That's one of the oldest
scams around.

02:25.333 --> 02:29.333
- Hey!
- Oh! It's warm.

02:29.333 --> 02:31.333
That's because it communicates
with the dead.

02:31.833 --> 02:34.333
That's because you've been
carrying it around in your pocket.

02:34.333 --> 02:37.400
I'll tell you what. You can try
out your summoner on the prince.

02:37.400 --> 02:39.167
But first we have to find him.
Hmm?

02:40.667 --> 02:43.167
Wait a minute.
Let me get a picture of you guys.

02:43.167 --> 02:45.800
Okay.

02:49.033 --> 02:51.400
Um, move a little to your left.

02:51.400 --> 02:53.400
I wanna get those drawings
in the shot.

02:53.400 --> 02:56.300
- They're called hieroglyphics.
- Whatever.

02:56.300 --> 02:58.833
I want them in the shot.

[ Wind Howling ]

03:21.300 --> 03:23.300
It's very simple.

03:23.300 --> 03:26.033
You just press the little button
and a picture pops out.

03:26.033 --> 03:28.367
Even you can do it.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.267
I know how to do it.

03:30.733 --> 03:32.133
Could've fooled me.

03:32.133 --> 03:34.067
Just smile, Sari.

03:36.067 --> 03:38.300
That's better.

That's weird.

03:58.367 --> 04:00.500
Come on, Gabe.
We gotta stick together.

04:04.800 --> 04:06.300
Sari, come here.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.800
Do you know what these mean?

04:10.800 --> 04:13.800
It's all about the journey
of the soul after death.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.800
Can't you just feel the presence...

04:15.800 --> 04:18.100
- of death here with us?
- Yeah.

04:18.100 --> 04:20.600
Creepy.

04:20.600 --> 04:25.233
I'd hate to be stuck in here
all by myself. Wouldn't you?

And you discovered it.

This is the entrance
to the prince's tomb.

07:30.500 --> 07:33.500
He fell into it.
That doesn't count.

07:33.500 --> 07:37.500
Sure, it does. And we're
going into the tomb tomorrow.

- Snakes?

07:40.000 --> 07:42.500
Won't your summoner
scare them away?

07:42.500 --> 07:44.567
If we send you in first,
that'll scare 'em.

07:44.567 --> 07:46.567
Probably even wake up the prince.

07:46.567 --> 07:50.067
Hey! All right, you two. I'll send in
a work crew, clear out all the snakes.

07:50.067 --> 07:53.067

- It's gone!
- Are you sure it's not in your tent?

07:58.933 --> 08:01.767
Yeah. I had it with me
in the pyramid. Remember?

08:02.700 --> 08:04.800
Well, then you probably
dropped it when you--

08:04.800 --> 08:08.533
- Became hysterical?
- I'm sure the crew will find it.

08:08.533 --> 08:11.800

something I picked up for you.

08:11.800 --> 08:14.300
What is it?

08:14.300 --> 08:16.367
- Some kind of old glass?
- Uh-uh.

08:16.367 --> 08:19.433
It's the petrified sap
of ancient trees.

08:19.433 --> 08:23.167
It's called amber. Look at it.
Look right inside it.

- There's a bug!
- That's right.

08:29.033 --> 08:30.967
It's an ancient scarab beetle.

08:30.967 --> 08:35.267
It was trapped in the amber
over 4,000 years ago.

08:37.767 --> 08:38.767

08:38.767 --> 08:41.767
Scarabs were very important
to the ancient Egyptians.

08:42.267 --> 08:45.967

to keep a scarab meant that...

to be for good luck.

You can read that stuff?
What does it mean?

10:52.800 --> 10:56.600
It's a warning to

10:57.100 --> 10:59.867
Sometimes, these tombs contain
a great deal of treasure.

11:00.300 --> 11:02.300

15:42.667 --> 15:45.100
But what about the warning?

15:45.600 --> 15:47.933
Don't you wanna be
the first one to see him?

15:47.933 --> 15:51.100
Sure.
I just don't wanna be the last.

15:51.100 --> 15:55.000
Are you gonna help me or not?

15:56.400 --> 15:58.600
[ Straining ]

15:58.600 --> 16:00.633
[ Straining ]

16:02.133 --> 16:05.633
Okay.
With all our might, heave.

16:05.633 --> 16:08.000
[ Both Straining ]

16:09.933 --> 16:11.767
[ Gabe ]
Uh-oh.

16:12.267 --> 16:13.700
Nobody home.

16:21.200 --> 16:23.467
[ Faint Moaning ]

16:23.967 --> 16:25.900
What was that?

16:26.400 --> 16:28.900
I don't think I wanna know.

16:32.100 --> 16:34.600
[ Footsteps Shuffling ]

[ Whimpering ]

17:07.367 --> 17:09.400
Come to me!

17:09.900 --> 17:13.933
- Nila?
- Come to me, my brother.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.300
It's Princess Nila...

17:17.800 --> 17:19.800
your sister.

17:19.800 --> 17:23.000
Come on!

17:24.433 --> 17:26.433
[ Moaning, Grunting ]

17:28.400 --> 17:31.467
I have waited so long for this day--

17:31.467 --> 17:34.400
that we may be reunited once again.

17:34.867 --> 17:37.933
- Hey, that's my summoner!
- Silence, foolish peasant!

17:37.933 --> 17:41.900
The summoner is mine.
Now...

17:42.400 --> 17:44.133
we shall rule again.

17:44.133 --> 17:45.967
She's crazy!

17:45.967 --> 17:48.367
Destroy them, my brother.

17:48.767 --> 17:51.967
- There can be no witnesses.
- [ Moaning Loudly ]

17:51.967 --> 17:54.067
No!

17:58.700 --> 18:03.767
Let me rest in peace!

18:03.767 --> 18:06.033
Horu, remember.

18:06.433 --> 18:08.867
You were weak.
I was strong.

18:09.300 --> 18:12.133
I was the one who ruled.
Do you remember, Horu?

18:12.567 --> 18:14.133
Do you remember, my brother?

18:15.500 --> 18:19.667
I... remember!

18:24.567 --> 18:27.567
My life! My life!

18:27.567 --> 18:31.467
I lived inside this stone
every night for 4,000 years!

18:31.900 --> 18:35.600
And now, I will never...

19:00.667 --> 19:02.633
[ Shouts ]

19:03.133 --> 19:05.100
Dead?
I guess not!

19:08.333 --> 19:10.233
Stay here!

19:13.367 --> 19:18.267
No! Stop!
Halt! Halteth?

20:20.000 --> 20:22.333
- Don't forget this.
- You keep it.

20:22.333 --> 20:25.200
- Something to remember me by.
- Old Egyptian custom.

20:25.200 --> 20:29.467
When you get a lousy gift,
you're stuck with it.

20:29.967 --> 20:32.500
 [ Ben, Indistinct ]
Please excuse me just one minute.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.000
I'll be right with you.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.733
Okay, so what do I tell
these reporters out here?

20:36.200 --> 20:37.600
- The truth?
- [ Gabe ] Sure.

20:38.100 --> 20:41.833
- Tell them the mummy walked.
- And his sister's a 4,000-year-old beetle.

20:42.333 --> 20:44.933
 [ Gabe ] And they almost got
together and ruled Egypt again.

20:45.933 --> 20:48.400
You're right.
Nothing but the truth.

20:50.533 --> 20:54.033
- It's too bad you can't stay.
- I wish I could.

20:54.533 --> 20:55.833
But I'm looking forward
to getting back

20:55.833 --> 20:57.700
to where the dead stay off
their feet.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.933
But, hey, maybe you can
come visit me next year.

21:01.433 --> 21:04.333
I can show you
the exotic world of shopping malls.

21:04.333 --> 21:07.667
Wow.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.500
I'll tell you one thing.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.500
When I get to the airport...

21:12.933 --> 21:15.833
I'm not buying
any more summoners.

21:15.833 --> 21:19.700
- Can I give you a hand?
- No, I got it.
