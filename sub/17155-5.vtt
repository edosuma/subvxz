[Stella]
<i>Previously on</i> Jonas LA...

00:01.333 --> 00:02.583
I talked to my director

00:02.667 --> 00:04.542
about who should play my love interest
in <i>Forever April,</i>

00:04.625 --> 00:07.291
and she wants a Joe from Jonas type!

00:07.375 --> 00:09.333
We are going to be
working together a lot.

00:09.417 --> 00:11.250
It is gonna be so intense!

00:12.291 --> 00:14.667
-Ben.
-I'm Stella.

00:14.750 --> 00:15.875
He just asked me out!

00:15.959 --> 00:17.125
-He's cute.
-I know.

00:17.208 --> 00:19.750
-Ben's a really nice guy.
-Thank you.

00:20.333 --> 00:21.792
-Hi, Mona.
-Security!

00:22.333 --> 00:23.166
No, that's...
That's not--

00:23.250 --> 00:25.208
-Get him off my set.
-No, hey...

00:25.458 --> 00:27.417
I'm OK.
Hey, we're fine. [chuckles]

00:28.083 --> 00:30.250
-Bye-bye.
-Wait, what happened?

00:39.792 --> 00:42.250
Dude, that's got "Kevin" on it.

00:43.000 --> 00:44.458
Uh, that's mine.

00:44.542 --> 00:47.291
Mm-hmm. I've got to leave quick
before Mona gets here.

00:47.375 --> 00:50.000
-Your director hates me.
-Why? Did you take her juice, too?

00:50.083 --> 00:53.000
-No, she just hates him.
-So, why's she coming over here?

00:53.083 --> 00:55.000
Well, she's doing a photo shoot
with Vanessa and I:

00:55.041 --> 00:57.083
"Hanging With the Stars
of <i>Forever April."</i>

00:57.166 --> 01:00.917
Yeah, so call me when the Wicked Witch
leaves and goes back home.

01:01.000 --> 01:02.542
Mona, hi!

01:02.959 --> 01:05.458
Where's the valet?
I don't park my own car.

01:05.542 --> 01:08.542
Miss Klein, I... I know we got off
on the wrong foot the other day.

01:08.625 --> 01:11.083
-Who are you?
-I'm Kevin, Joe's brother.

01:11.166 --> 01:12.500
You actually kicked me off
your set last week.

01:12.583 --> 01:15.208
Mmm, then why am I even looking at you?

01:15.291 --> 01:16.709
Oh, I live here.

01:16.792 --> 01:18.375
Good, then you should know
where to park it.

01:18.458 --> 01:22.166
Oh, and while you're at it,
you ding my car, I ding your head.

01:22.291 --> 01:23.917
-Show Joe.
-Hey.

01:24.041 --> 01:26.417
Photo shoot.
Let's go make some magic.

01:26.500 --> 01:27.333
Let's do it.

01:27.417 --> 01:28.625
[Mona continues indistinct]

01:28.709 --> 01:31.750
Hey, Kev, while you're at it,
clean my room.

So, I was at this
organic Tibetan place last night,

02:32.458 --> 02:36.000
and Fergie sent over
a plate of curry lentils, so delish.

02:36.083 --> 02:38.792
That's so funny, because this morning
my brother totally took away my waffle.

02:38.875 --> 02:44.750
-Really? Why?
-Mmm, because he wanted to.

02:44.834 --> 02:48.125
Well, I'm an only child,
so I don't understand.

02:48.208 --> 02:51.542
I love it!
My two stars bonding offscreen.

02:51.625 --> 02:54.792
This is the magic that
we're gonna capture today.

02:54.875 --> 02:57.166
Just the two of us being ourselves?

02:57.250 --> 03:00.417
Exactly. You know, the fans want to know
who the stars really are.

03:00.500 --> 03:03.500
These pictures are going to be everywhere.

03:03.583 --> 03:07.375
By the time <i>Forever April</i> comes out,
America is gonna be so sick of you.

03:07.458 --> 03:10.291
-That's a good thing, right?
-Yes, you want people to be sick of you,

03:10.375 --> 03:12.792
so sick they can't live without you.
Wardrobe!

03:13.583 --> 03:17.500
Sorry. Just making some
last-minute alterations.

03:17.583 --> 03:18.709
Uh-huh.

03:19.041 --> 03:23.208
-Where'd they dig you up from?
-I'm Stella, Joe's friend.

03:23.291 --> 03:25.917
-I style Jonas.
-Great.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.709
But I didn't pick out Joe's shirt...
unless you like it?

03:28.792 --> 03:30.291
I don't.
Ditch it.

03:30.375 --> 03:32.709
You know, you've got some
great stuff here, Blondie.

03:32.792 --> 03:35.125
I'm gonna call you "Blondie."
See you soon.

03:35.208 --> 03:37.458
All right, you, makeup;
you, walk and talk.

03:37.542 --> 03:39.125
I'll see you in five.

03:39.542 --> 03:43.625
Very good.
So, listen, how are you at kissing?

03:43.709 --> 03:45.834
Wow, Mona, I'm flattered,
but I don't think that's a good idea.

03:45.917 --> 03:47.834
No, not me, you dope.
Vanessa.

03:47.917 --> 03:50.166
Look, I'm watching the two of you,
and I'm seeing sparks.

03:50.250 --> 03:52.250
So, here's what I'm thinking,
I start shooting,

03:52.333 --> 03:54.792
you swoop in,
you take her into your arms,

03:54.875 --> 03:57.959
and you give her a surprise
kiss right on the moosh.

03:58.041 --> 04:02.625
-"Moosh" is lips, right?
-[scoffs] You broke the code.

04:03.625 --> 04:06.709
-So, what do you say?
-I say, yeah, that'd be awesome.

04:06.792 --> 04:11.875
Great! I see you as Hollywood's
next it couple: Joe and Vanessa.

04:12.125 --> 04:16.667
Or wait, better yet: "Jonessa."

04:16.750 --> 04:18.375
Or "Vanessoe."

04:20.458 --> 04:22.000
I liked yours better.

04:29.417 --> 04:31.750
Can you give these to Mona?
I gotta go before she remembers who I am.

04:31.834 --> 04:33.792
Dude, I think you're missing
the big picture.

04:33.875 --> 04:35.709
-You want to be a director, right?
-Yeah.

04:35.792 --> 04:37.542
And Mona is one of
the biggest directors out there.

04:37.625 --> 04:40.000
-True.
-Now, instead of running away from her,

04:40.083 --> 04:42.792
why don't you get her to like you?
Maybe she can help you.

04:42.875 --> 04:44.875
But does it have to be her?

04:44.959 --> 04:46.542
Or you could wait for
the next world-famous director

04:46.625 --> 04:47.542
to walk through the door.

04:48.333 --> 04:50.792
-Is it tiring always being right?
-No.

04:50.875 --> 04:52.000
[scoffs]

04:56.375 --> 04:59.709
Joe, I'm having the best time
on this shoot.

04:59.792 --> 05:03.625
I mean, can you believe Mona Klein
just gave me a nickname?

05:03.709 --> 05:05.208
Blondie!

05:05.625 --> 05:09.834
She also gave me and Vanessa
a nickname: Jonessa.

05:10.208 --> 05:12.542
She's making you split one?
That's cheap.

05:12.625 --> 05:15.083
Excuse me. Oh, whatever.
-OK.

05:15.166 --> 05:16.834
I should probably give you
the heads up on this, you know,

05:16.917 --> 05:19.959
since you and I were almost "Joella."

05:20.041 --> 05:23.750
Well, now that you're dating Ben,
you're kind of like "Benella," right?

05:23.834 --> 05:26.959
So, do you want to stop putting names
together and just tell me what's going on?

05:27.041 --> 05:30.083
Mona wants me to kiss Vanessa
today during the shoot.

05:31.542 --> 05:32.667
Oh.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.500
Wow. And... how do you feel about that?

05:36.583 --> 05:37.875
Good.

05:38.041 --> 05:39.959
And how does Vanessa feel?

05:40.083 --> 05:41.500
Normal.

05:41.583 --> 05:43.917
Well, that's 'cause
she doesn't know it's coming.

05:44.083 --> 05:46.125
Hmm, interesting.

05:46.291 --> 05:49.458
All right, tell me what I did wrong,
because I know that's where this is going.

05:49.542 --> 05:53.333
No, it's just... it sounds like you're
about to give Vanessa a surprise kiss.

05:54.291 --> 05:57.583
Yeah, on the moosh.
It's Hollywood for "lips."

05:57.667 --> 06:00.667
Yeah, well, a kiss is never just a kiss.

06:00.750 --> 06:03.083
It always means something to a girl.

06:03.166 --> 06:05.417
I mean, do you even like her?

06:06.125 --> 06:08.125
Yeah, I kinda got a thing for her.

06:09.125 --> 06:10.834
Does she like you?

06:10.917 --> 06:13.542
I mean, I just kind of assumed she did.

06:14.250 --> 06:18.709
Well, I mean, don't you want to ask
before you surprise kiss her?

06:18.792 --> 06:22.625
[scoffs] I wasn't really thinking about it
until you made me feel crazy.

06:23.083 --> 06:26.291
No, I just... I just don't want you
to embarrass yourself.

06:27.583 --> 06:28.667
You talk to her.

06:29.750 --> 06:34.291
What? No.
No, Joe, I don't even know her, so...

06:34.375 --> 06:35.959
Come on, you speak girl.

06:36.041 --> 06:38.917
And I don't want to
get shot down... again.

06:39.000 --> 06:42.166
Oh. Oh, the guilt card.
Wow.

06:42.250 --> 06:44.375
Come on, as a friend.

06:44.458 --> 06:47.375
-And the friend card.
-And the please card. Please?

06:47.458 --> 06:49.041
-Fine.
-Yes.

06:49.125 --> 06:50.417
-All right.
-Ha-ha.

06:50.500 --> 06:52.709
Miss Klein, I got your keys here.

06:52.792 --> 06:56.125
And may I say,
your taste in cars in impeccable.

06:56.208 --> 06:59.583
I remember you. You're that chatterbox
that I kicked off my set.

06:59.667 --> 07:02.667
Yes, about that...
I was way out of line.

07:02.750 --> 07:04.792
I'm over it. And I'm famished.
Do me a favor.

07:04.875 --> 07:08.291
Boil me an egg, throw it out
and then pour the water into a glass.

07:08.375 --> 07:09.208
Why?

07:09.291 --> 07:11.709
[groans] You know, my last assistant
would never have asked that question.

07:11.792 --> 07:13.959
-Lousy quitter.
-Wait, your assistant quit?

07:14.041 --> 07:16.625
[sighs] Yeah, this morning.
Well, actually I fired him,

07:16.709 --> 07:18.417
but I'm saying that he quit
because he's my nephew.

07:18.500 --> 07:24.000
OK. Actually, let's make a deal.
If I help you, then you'll help me.

07:24.083 --> 07:27.083
Hardball, I'm impressed. Talk to me.

07:27.166 --> 07:29.834
I want you to tell me everything
there is to know about being a director.

07:29.917 --> 07:32.250
Ah, you want to know the secrets.

07:32.333 --> 07:34.834
-There's a secret?
-Calm down, Curly.

07:34.917 --> 07:36.542
I'm calling you "Curly" now.

07:36.709 --> 07:40.375
Here's the deal:
you survive a day as my assistant,

07:40.458 --> 07:42.625
and I will tell you
everything you need to know.

07:42.709 --> 07:44.250
-Sweet.
-Lucky for you,

07:44.333 --> 07:46.291
there's only one more thing that I need.

07:46.875 --> 07:50.375
See this earring here?
It's lonely.

07:51.792 --> 07:56.208
-You want me to talk to it?
-No, I don't need you to talk to it.

07:56.291 --> 07:58.125
I need you to find the other one.

07:58.208 --> 08:00.250
I lost it the other day
during my power walk.

08:00.333 --> 08:02.041
OK, where'd you lose it?

08:02.125 --> 08:04.458
-The beach.
-Can you narrow that down?

08:05.333 --> 08:07.458
-Malibu.
-A little bit more?

08:07.542 --> 08:09.333
[groans]
Do I have to do everything for you?

08:09.417 --> 08:12.917
I was sunbathing at lifeguard station #2.
You'll find it there.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.125
-How do you know if it's still even there?
-Go.

08:15.208 --> 08:16.291
Gone.

08:17.542 --> 08:18.542
[sighs]

08:18.625 --> 08:19.834
So, what do you think?

08:19.917 --> 08:22.959
I love it.
I knew you'd be good at this.

08:23.041 --> 08:25.208
Really? Why?

08:25.291 --> 08:28.500
Because pretty girls
know how to dress pretty girls.

08:28.583 --> 08:32.458
-You think I'm pretty?
-Oh, definitely.

08:32.542 --> 08:37.083
-I like you.
-You are so superficial.

08:37.166 --> 08:38.625
Guilty!

08:39.000 --> 08:40.250
Here, try this.

08:41.583 --> 08:42.625
[clears throat]

08:43.375 --> 08:48.875
So, you and Joe?
What's the dealio?

08:50.959 --> 08:54.375
Oh, my gosh,
that is such a good question.

08:54.458 --> 08:58.583
I mean, he is so cute,
but impossible to read.

08:58.667 --> 09:01.083
My spiritual advisor told me
to keep my heart open to love,

09:01.166 --> 09:04.250
but I don't know if that's because of Joe,
or I should rescue a puppy.

09:04.333 --> 09:06.625
-You know?
-Mm-hmm.

09:07.166 --> 09:09.083
Yeah, let me... let me rephrase.

09:09.166 --> 09:12.709
Um... do you have feelings for Joe?

09:13.291 --> 09:16.500
Yes.
Absolutely, yes.

09:16.583 --> 09:19.875
So if he were to, say,
kiss you during the photo shoot...

09:19.959 --> 09:21.834
Oh, my gosh, is he going to?

09:21.917 --> 09:23.542
Tell him to.
I want him to.

09:25.208 --> 09:28.750
Are you sure you don't want to
think about that for just, like, a second?

09:28.834 --> 09:32.792
No. Ahh!
Joe's gonna kiss me?

09:32.875 --> 09:35.041
[squeals]

09:35.875 --> 09:37.458
Do you have a mint?

09:39.417 --> 09:42.375
-Nick, I need your help.
-It's called a metal detector.

09:42.458 --> 09:44.208
This is no time for your dry humor.

09:44.291 --> 09:47.000
OK? I have to find an earring in Malibu
so I can become a director.

09:47.083 --> 09:49.417
I told you to make Mona like you,
and as usual,

09:49.500 --> 09:51.333
you've taken this to a very weird place.

09:51.417 --> 09:53.709
That's right. Now it's your job
to help me through it.

09:55.959 --> 09:58.000
-Fine.
-All right.

09:58.208 --> 10:00.834
So, when Mona tells me
the secret of directing,

10:00.917 --> 10:02.250
I'm gonna put you in my movie.

10:02.333 --> 10:04.041
Kevin, every day feels like
I'm in your movie.

10:04.125 --> 10:06.208
Oh, wait, where's your metal detector?

10:06.291 --> 10:07.792
Why would I have a metal detector?

10:08.333 --> 10:10.041
You're right.
I'll go get Joe's.

10:14.667 --> 10:16.000
There you are.
Come, come, come.

10:16.083 --> 10:19.041
The light is perfect.
You're looking marvelous.

10:19.625 --> 10:20.834
Watch your step.

10:20.959 --> 10:23.667

take it personally.

I may have turned my thumb the wrong way.

14:35.834 --> 14:37.917
How do you turn your thumb the wrong way?

14:38.000 --> 14:40.291
It was hard because I didn't want to
watch you kiss her.

What?

and you're dating somebody else.

I know, but in the moment, I just...
I couldn't let it happen.

14:52.709 --> 14:53.709
I'm sorry.

14:53.792 --> 14:59.625
It was selfish, and childish,
and immature, and wrong and...

you still like me.

-No, I was confused.
-Because you still like me.

15:14.166 --> 15:18.083
-It was a brief lapse in judgment.
-A brief lapse of liking me.

15:18.166 --> 15:20.125
Liking you less.

15:20.208 --> 15:23.458
I guess we both can agree
that I'm a tough habit to break.

Oh! Oh, there it is. You did it.
Habit broken. Thank you.

15:31.333 --> 15:33.709

just you and me, totally real.

Would you like to go to dinner with me?

I'd love to.
