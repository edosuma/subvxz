17:01.687 --> 17:03.272

17:03.272 --> 17:05.607
Sixteeny.

17:05.691 --> 17:07.776
The actual word
I was looking for.

17:07.860 --> 17:09.153
Oh, you've not seen me
at 16 before?

17:09.153 --> 17:12.489
No, I-- I have. Just not looking
so, uh...

17:13.824 --> 17:15.117
So what?

17:17.161 --> 17:19.079
Where are my clothes, Clare?

17:19.163 --> 17:22.416
They're my dad's, so I had to
return them eventually.

17:22.416 --> 17:26.128
- So I bought you some new ones.
- Great. Thank you.

17:27.588 --> 17:31.258
Where are they?
The, uh, the new clothes?

17:31.258 --> 17:35.095
Oh, sort of scattered
about the place.

17:35.179 --> 17:37.973
- Scattered?
- Yeah, scattered.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.976
You just have to go look
for them.

17:42.478 --> 17:44.146
Clare, I'm naked.

17:44.146 --> 17:45.773
I've seen you naked
lots of times.

17:45.773 --> 17:48.025
Yeah, but this is--

17:49.777 --> 17:52.654
Well, you're older now.
There are rules.

17:52.738 --> 17:54.615

26:20.537 --> 26:21.746

26:23.123 --> 26:24.666
Okay, so I'm not allowed

It's impossible.

with you?

26:59.284 --> 27:01.828

you fucking asked!

27:24.601 --> 27:25.685
Your hands are bleeding.

27:32.108 --> 27:33.193

27:33.943 --> 27:35.278
See? It's my own fingernails.

27:36.780 --> 27:38.073
Like I said. Nervous passenger.

27:38.073 --> 27:40.033
I was in a car accident.
I have bad memories, that's why.

27:40.033 --> 27:42.160
Yeah, but you knew
there wouldn't be an accident
today, so--

27:42.160 --> 27:43.703
You could've ended up
in traction for a year!

27:43.787 --> 27:45.163
You could've killed somebody.

27:45.163 --> 27:46.581
You could've wiped out
an entire family

27:46.581 --> 27:48.500
and had to live with that
for the rest of your life.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.752
- Don't you lecture me!
- Shut up and listen!

27:53.088 --> 27:56.257
Your life, whatever it is,
is entirely built

27:56.341 --> 27:58.426
from the choices that you make.

27:58.510 --> 28:00.929
The future, fixed or not,
is what you choose.

28:00.929 --> 28:03.681
You are what makes it fixed.
You're not running on tracks,

28:03.765 --> 28:06.059
everything is still
your decision.

28:12.690 --> 28:13.983
I just set a new record.

28:14.067 --> 28:15.735
I mansplained the rest
of your life.

28:17.654 --> 28:18.863
CLARE, 16: What's "mansplained"?

28:18.947 --> 28:20.907
Well, there's every chance
you're gonna find out, Clare.

28:21.324 --> 28:22.325
When?

28:22.992 --> 28:24.327
What? In the future?

28:24.411 --> 28:26.579
When you know me,
and all my family,

28:26.663 --> 28:28.915
and you're married
to a woman with my name?

28:33.253 --> 28:35.004
We're not together
in the future, Clare.

28:40.218 --> 28:41.219
Fine!

29:00.572 --> 29:01.781
So...

29:02.991 --> 29:04.826
something happened.
Do you want to talk about it?

29:09.372 --> 29:10.832
Have you ever been arrested?

29:12.917 --> 29:14.252
HENRY, 32: Well, uh,

29:14.252 --> 29:16.629
I show up naked places
and steal to eat,

29:16.713 --> 29:17.881
so, yeah, I've been arrested.

29:18.882 --> 29:20.008
CLARE, 16:
But it doesn't matter.

29:20.008 --> 29:21.801
Because if they put you
in a cell,

29:21.885 --> 29:25.013
eventually you just disappear,
right?

29:25.013 --> 29:27.140
Well, usually from the back
of a police car,

29:27.140 --> 29:28.558
but yeah, basically.

29:28.558 --> 29:30.101
So you can get away
with anything

29:30.185 --> 29:31.936
when you're back in time.

29:32.020 --> 29:35.940
Uh, well, I-- I guess,
but that's not really the point.

29:36.024 --> 29:37.192
CLARE, 16: There's a boy.

29:37.734 --> 29:39.235

29:43.323 --> 29:44.324

29:45.492 --> 29:46.618

29:49.162 --> 29:50.413

Hi. Call for me?

30:30.411 --> 30:31.704

30:32.455 --> 30:34.290

- Awesome.

30:37.877 --> 30:39.254

- Hey, it's me.

30:39.254 --> 30:40.547

30:40.547 --> 30:42.340

someplace? 'Cause I'm at work.

30:42.340 --> 30:43.800

not to be alone tonight.

and ten o'clock tonight.

30:46.970 --> 30:49.138
Why? Are you gonna kill someone?

30:49.222 --> 30:50.807
Between eight and ten,
you got that?

30:52.475 --> 30:54.227
You are gonna kill someone.

30:54.227 --> 30:55.812
- Hanging up now.
- Fuck you.

30:55.812 --> 30:56.980
Fuck you too.

31:09.617 --> 31:11.536
So when are you gonna
tell me what he did?

31:11.536 --> 31:12.912
I don't want to talk about it.

31:12.996 --> 31:15.290
Can you just accept
that he totally deserves this?

31:19.711 --> 31:20.712
Yes.

31:23.172 --> 31:27.176
<i>How do you know
it's him? Actually him.</i>

31:28.052 --> 31:29.721
It's not hearts and flowers.

31:31.222 --> 31:33.725
- You can't come.
- I'm coming.

31:35.184 --> 31:37.103
It's not music in the air.

31:37.103 --> 31:39.314
You can't come,
you'll need an alibi too.

31:40.523 --> 31:41.608
I want to watch.

31:44.444 --> 31:46.988
It's when he's ready
to kill for you.

31:47.947 --> 31:49.699
- Glove box.
- What?

31:49.699 --> 31:50.825
Glove box.

31:55.622 --> 31:56.789
It's my dad's.

32:01.919 --> 32:03.338
What the hell did he do to you?

32:04.589 --> 32:05.632
He's an asshole.

32:10.678 --> 32:12.722
I used to be an asshole myself.

32:14.724 --> 32:18.978
- Well, no cars in the driveway.
- No, he's home alone. I checked.

32:21.564 --> 32:23.066
- ♪ ♪
- Coming.

32:25.151 --> 32:27.278
Jesus. I'm coming! All right.

32:30.073 --> 32:31.741
Who are you?

32:33.242 --> 32:35.411
Okay, there's a car behind me,

32:35.495 --> 32:37.121
and you're going to get
in the trunk.

32:37.538 --> 32:38.581
Why?

32:39.791 --> 32:41.250
Because if I murder you
right here,

32:41.334 --> 32:42.877
it might be really hard
to get away with,

32:42.877 --> 32:45.630
and I might get in trouble.

32:48.716 --> 32:51.094
Hello. Did you hear me?

32:51.094 --> 32:54.180
Hello, gun, wakey wakey.

32:57.058 --> 32:59.560
Jesus Christ,
you're splashing me!

32:59.644 --> 33:01.896
What kind of a person pees
on someone at gunpoint?

33:01.896 --> 33:03.231
What the hell is wrong with you?

33:03.231 --> 33:05.775
Duck your head.

33:06.567 --> 33:07.985
I'm gonna close the trunk,

33:08.069 --> 33:09.529
duck your head
or it's gonna hurt.

33:09.529 --> 33:11.114
You're gonna kill me.

33:11.114 --> 33:13.157
Yeah, well,
don't make things worse.

33:16.786 --> 33:19.497
He peed on me.

33:19.497 --> 33:21.958
- Okay.
- Worst murder ever.

33:36.931 --> 33:38.391
- What's that noise?
- Mm.

33:45.022 --> 33:47.358
Oh! It's okay,
it's not your car.

33:47.442 --> 33:48.735
He's just breathing funny.

33:49.902 --> 33:52.238
- Didn't you get his inhaler?
- His what?

33:53.531 --> 33:56.909
Well, I-- He's asthmatic.
He's got an inhaler, I saw it.

33:56.993 --> 33:57.994
So?

34:01.831 --> 34:03.416
- What are you doing?
- No. We need to go back

34:03.416 --> 34:06.127
- and get his inhaler.
- No! No! No! Clare.

34:06.127 --> 34:10.047
No! Clare, seriously, no.
I'm not doing that. I refuse.

34:28.775 --> 34:29.817
We're not going to kill him.

34:32.195 --> 34:33.821
Okay.

34:33.905 --> 34:36.783
You're going to hurt him,
and I'm gonna watch,

34:36.783 --> 34:38.576
but we're not going to kill him.

34:38.576 --> 34:42.288
What are you laughing at?

34:42.288 --> 34:44.791
I mean, kill him?
We just got him his inhaler.

34:44.791 --> 34:47.251
I'm starting to think we might
need to throw pillow back there.

34:48.711 --> 34:49.879
You think this is funny?

34:51.756 --> 34:53.007
You think this is a joke?

34:56.385 --> 34:57.386
No.

34:59.931 --> 35:01.182
You want to know what he did?

35:05.436 --> 35:06.437
Yeah, I do.

35:50.815 --> 35:52.066
HENRY, 32: Jesus Christ!

35:53.651 --> 35:55.194
- Are you okay?
- CLARE, 16: Mm.

35:57.947 --> 35:59.240
- Did he rape you?
- No.

36:00.449 --> 36:01.826
- Did he rape you?
- No.

36:04.412 --> 36:06.122
No. He just hurt me.

36:08.791 --> 36:09.792
He, um...

36:11.502 --> 36:12.503
He took me to...

36:13.880 --> 36:17.174
In his car...
There's a place people go.

36:19.510 --> 36:21.345
Why don't you tell me
what happened?

36:26.851 --> 36:30.229
He got angry.

36:32.648 --> 36:33.649
He, um...

36:35.151 --> 36:38.529
He said it wasn't fair to him,

36:39.280 --> 36:41.866
me changing my mind.

36:44.035 --> 36:46.078
- But I never said I would.
- It's okay, it's okay.

36:46.162 --> 36:49.916
- No, but I never said I would!
- It's okay. It's all okay.

36:55.421 --> 36:56.756
He burned me.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.050
He what?

37:00.468 --> 37:02.011
He had a cigarette.

37:06.557 --> 37:08.142
Fuck! Fuck!

37:12.063 --> 37:13.731
Okay, so you just said
we're not gonna kill him.

37:13.731 --> 37:15.107
- No, we're not.
- You're gonna go home.

37:15.191 --> 37:17.234
- You're gonna leave this to me.
- No. We're not gonna kill him.

37:17.318 --> 37:18.611
Clare, you're not gonna
be part--

37:18.611 --> 37:20.363
No, stop it! Don't!

37:20.363 --> 37:23.282
Don't you dare make this
about how angry you are,

37:23.366 --> 37:24.951
it's not about that.

37:24.951 --> 37:28.204
We're going to hurt him,
not kill him.

37:32.875 --> 37:34.085
He didn't rape me.

37:39.715 --> 37:41.467
- Okay?
- Okay.

37:42.969 --> 37:44.303
Okay, I'm sorry.

37:46.347 --> 37:47.848
<i>Of course he raped me.</i>

37:48.891 --> 37:50.601
Of course he did.

37:50.685 --> 37:53.437
I was in his car,
there was no one to see.

37:53.521 --> 37:54.689
Why wouldn't he rape me?

38:07.868 --> 38:10.871
<i>I never told Henry the truth.</i>

38:10.955 --> 38:15.042
If I had told him the truth,
it would make it even more true,

38:15.126 --> 38:16.711
and I did not want it to be.

38:19.505 --> 38:22.383
HENRY, 32: Come on Get out.
Get the fuck out. Come on.

38:22.383 --> 38:24.301
<i>You don't admit
that a monster</i>

38:24.385 --> 38:25.720
<i>was the first man inside you</i>

38:25.720 --> 38:28.306
<i>when you're talking to the man
it should have been.</i>

38:32.643 --> 38:35.062
<i>Henry never knew the truth.</i>

38:35.146 --> 38:39.066
So when I was with Henry,
it stopped being true.

38:39.150 --> 38:42.028
I could make it not true
when he was there.

38:45.698 --> 38:48.117
Of course, he's been dead
such a long time now.

38:56.751 --> 38:58.377
I think we're safe from him now, Clare.

39:01.338 --> 39:03.924
- What are you gonna do to me?
- I'm not sure.

39:05.509 --> 39:07.303
Clare, any ideas?

39:08.596 --> 39:10.222
Fuck!

39:10.306 --> 39:13.601
Are you gonna kill me?

39:13.601 --> 39:15.436
HENRY, 32: Kill you?

39:15.436 --> 39:18.064
You're an asthmatic who smokes,
who needs to kill you?

39:22.151 --> 39:23.694
What do you think, Clare? Hey?

39:25.613 --> 39:26.864
Break his eardrums?

39:28.074 --> 39:29.700
Break his nose?

39:29.784 --> 39:32.078
No, wait, he's broken
that once already.

39:32.078 --> 39:34.121
- What about cut his Achilles tendons?
- No.

39:34.205 --> 39:35.956
He wouldn't be playing
football for a long time.

39:36.040 --> 39:37.500
No! Please. No.

39:37.500 --> 39:40.169
Don't fucking beg.
I might enjoy it.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.296
Who are you?

39:42.296 --> 39:44.381
I'm a friend of Clare's.
Here to ask you, man to man,

39:44.465 --> 39:47.093
or man
to whatever-I'm-looking-at...

39:49.053 --> 39:50.262
how could you do that to her?

39:51.472 --> 39:53.891
- Do what?
- I know what you did, Jason.

39:56.977 --> 39:57.937
Tell him the truth.

39:57.937 --> 39:59.730
She did tell me,
and she showed me.

39:59.814 --> 40:01.941
Did she show you her phone?
Did you show him your phone?

40:01.941 --> 40:04.944
It's not about a fucking phone!

40:04.944 --> 40:08.906
Show him the phone.
Read her texts!

40:08.906 --> 40:10.950
Before you lay a finger on me,
read her texts.

40:10.950 --> 40:12.409
'Cause that's the truth,
right there.

40:12.493 --> 40:16.455
What she says in her texts.
We went out and we had fun.

40:16.539 --> 40:17.790
And she texted me afterwards,

40:17.790 --> 40:19.708
the same night
and the next morning.

40:19.792 --> 40:22.169
And you wanna know
what she said?

40:22.253 --> 40:24.755
She said,
"Thanks for a great night!"

40:24.839 --> 40:27.758
That's what she said,
"Great night." Read her texts!

40:36.016 --> 40:40.062
- HENRY, 32: Hey. Come here.
- No!

40:44.442 --> 40:46.277
Go on, Clare.

40:46.277 --> 40:48.821
Show him the phone.
Show him your texts.

40:49.864 --> 40:51.991
I deleted them.
Why?

40:51.991 --> 40:54.994
Why did you delete them?
Why would she delete them?

40:54.994 --> 40:58.289
Because I'll tell you something.
I didn't.

40:58.289 --> 40:59.498
And when you're done with me,

40:59.582 --> 41:01.333
or when you're done
doing whatever shit

41:01.417 --> 41:02.501
you're gonna do to me,

41:02.585 --> 41:04.879
when you're done beating
the crap out of me...

41:04.879 --> 41:09.383
my phone is in my robe pocket.
I didn't delete those texts.

41:09.383 --> 41:12.428
Read them, then see
how you fucking feel.

41:18.142 --> 41:19.685
I did send those texts.

41:21.896 --> 41:24.356
- I was frightened.
- I know.

41:24.440 --> 41:26.192
'Cause I didn't want him
to be angry at me.

41:26.192 --> 41:28.903
- I understand.
- I wanted to make it normal.

41:29.820 --> 41:31.989
In my head. Normal.

41:33.199 --> 41:35.868
"Great night."
That's what she said.

41:35.868 --> 41:39.038
- Those exact words.
- It doesn't matter what she said!

41:39.038 --> 41:40.831
I saw the bruises.
You burnt her.

41:41.790 --> 41:43.042
Jesus.
Where the hell have you been?

41:43.042 --> 41:47.671
Don't you get it?
She likes that. She likes it.

41:47.755 --> 41:49.548
- She had a great night!
- No, she didn't.

41:49.632 --> 41:52.551
What the fuck would you know
about it, some doofus friend

41:52.635 --> 41:55.012
- of her dad's? She's into that.
- No, she isn't.

41:55.012 --> 41:56.263
She loves it.
It's what she wants.

41:56.347 --> 41:58.432
- It is not what she wants!
- She likes it rough.

41:58.432 --> 42:00.518
No, she doesn't
and she never has!

42:00.518 --> 42:01.936
How the fuck would you know?

42:01.936 --> 42:04.772
Because I'm her fucking husband!

42:29.296 --> 42:32.049
I--

42:33.259 --> 42:36.720
- Shit, I think I'm going.
- No, not now!

42:41.267 --> 42:44.144
I don't know why, but I think
you're going to need this.

42:44.228 --> 42:46.063
I love you.

42:50.859 --> 42:56.949
Shit.

43:08.919 --> 43:11.171
I didn't want Jason to die
of an asthma attack

43:11.255 --> 43:14.216
while tied up and half naked.

43:14.300 --> 43:19.805
Well, I did, in fact,
but not on my watch.

43:21.598 --> 43:24.184
<i>But equally, I didn't want
to be alone with him.</i>

43:26.061 --> 43:28.063
<i>So I called my friends.</i>

43:28.147 --> 43:32.609
I called every girl I knew
and asked them to come over.

43:56.258 --> 43:57.426
Where did you go?

44:00.637 --> 44:02.681
I always wondered
why you kept this old pen.

44:04.475 --> 44:05.643
You gave it to me.

44:06.769 --> 44:07.895
What did you do with it?

44:10.522 --> 44:11.899
I made one rule.

44:13.025 --> 44:16.528
You could only come
if a boy had hurt you.

44:16.612 --> 44:18.280
<i>While I waited for them
to arrive,</i>

44:18.364 --> 44:20.741
<i>I wrote the whole story
of what happened</i>

44:20.741 --> 44:22.326
<i>with Jason that night...</i>

44:23.285 --> 44:24.703
<i>on Jason.</i>

44:24.787 --> 44:28.165
<i>I invited them all to add
any stories of their own.</i>

44:28.165 --> 44:30.125
<i>We were there a long time.</i>

44:32.002 --> 44:34.588
<i>He became my first sculpture.</i>

44:34.672 --> 44:37.925
<i>I learnt that night
that art isn't something</i>

44:37.925 --> 44:40.594
<i>hanging on a wall,
or standing on a plinth.</i>

44:41.845 --> 44:45.432
<i>Sometimes... it's revenge.</i>

44:45.516 --> 44:49.186
I only saw Henry one more time
in our clearing.

44:53.941 --> 44:55.651
<i>But that's another story.</i>

44:56.652 --> 44:57.694
Hello, Henry.

45:00.406 --> 45:02.032
<i>Two years after that,</i>

45:02.116 --> 45:05.869
<i>after I had known the love
of my life for 14 years,</i>

45:05.953 --> 45:08.372
<i>I met him for the first time.</i>

45:08.372 --> 45:10.916
<i>He was younger
than I'd ever seen him,</i>

45:10.916 --> 45:12.835
<i>didn't have a clue who I was,</i>

45:12.835 --> 45:16.505
<i>and was quite
the most beautiful man</i>

45:16.505 --> 45:17.756
<i>I had ever met.</i>

45:18.841 --> 45:21.260
Henry.
<i>Here he was at last.</i>

45:21.260 --> 45:24.221
<i>My soulmate
since I was six years old.</i>

45:25.597 --> 45:29.268
And he was an asshole.
