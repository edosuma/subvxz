-<i> HOT IN CLEVELAND</i>
IS RECORDED

00:03.836 --> 00:05.755
IN FRONT OF A LIVE
STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:05.839 --> 00:08.591
- AND YOU KNOW, COLIN,
I WAS SURPRISED TO FIND OUT

00:08.675 --> 00:12.095
HOW MANY OHIOANS ARE MAKING
CHEESE IN THEIR OWN BACKYARDS.

00:12.178 --> 00:14.639
AND WHO KNEW CHEESE
CAME FROM AN ANIMAL?

00:14.723 --> 00:17.726
- ER, EVERYBODY.

00:17.809 --> 00:20.270
AND FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO LIKE
WINE WITH WITH YOUR CHEESE,

00:20.353 --> 00:22.105
AND I KNOW YOU DO,
VICTORIA,

00:22.188 --> 00:25.358
TONIGHT'S TECH REPORT REVIEWS
A GROUNDBREAKING NEW APP

00:25.442 --> 00:27.569
THAT ACTUALLY LETS YOU
TASTE AND SMELL THINGS

00:27.652 --> 00:29.154
RIGHT ON YOUR COMPUTER.

00:29.237 --> 00:32.115
FOR EXAMPLE,
THIS 1964 LAFITE.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.116
[sniffs]

00:33.199 --> 00:34.868
OH, THAT IS FANTASTIC.

00:34.951 --> 00:38.288
VICTORIA, SMELL THE BOUQUET.
- [sniffs]

00:38.371 --> 00:41.207
- I DON'T SMELL ANYTHING.
- REALLY?

00:41.291 --> 00:42.000
OH, THEY DID SAY
SENIOR CITIZENS

00:42.083 --> 00:43.251
MIGHT NOT BE ABLE
TO SMELL IT--

00:43.334 --> 00:45.170
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT!

00:45.253 --> 00:47.547
AH, YES, YES.
NO, I--I SMELL IT NOW.

00:47.630 --> 00:49.007
I SMELL IT BIG TIME.

00:49.090 --> 00:51.968
- AND THE MOST
AMAZING FEATURE IS

00:52.051 --> 00:53.428
IF YOU LICK THE SCREEN,

00:53.511 --> 00:55.096
YOU CAN ACTUALLY
TASTE THE WINE.

00:55.180 --> 01:01.019
IT'S REMARKABLE.

01:01.102 --> 01:04.022
- MMM.
OH, IT'S A BIT TANNIC.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.774
BUT, UM, VERY BOLD FINISH.

01:05.857 --> 01:07.484
[electronic cackling]

01:07.567 --> 01:12.113
[laughter]

01:12.197 --> 01:14.491
- GOTCHA!

01:14.574 --> 01:17.035
OH, THE FUN WE HAVE HERE
AT CHANNEL SEVEN.

01:17.118 --> 01:18.745
- OH, WE CERTAINLY DO.
LOTS OF FUN.

01:18.828 --> 01:21.164
- BUT WHAT ISN'T FUN

01:21.247 --> 01:23.124
IS THAT THERE IS SOMETHING
IN YOUR HOUSE RIGHT NOW

01:23.208 --> 01:24.876
THAT MAY BE KILLING YOU
AND YOUR CHILDREN.

01:24.959 --> 01:26.961
STAY TUNED RIGHT
AFTER THESE WORDS.

01:28.963 --> 01:31.132
- I MEAN, COLIN PULLS THESE
PRANKS ALL THE TIME.

01:31.216 --> 01:32.217
THIS IS JUST THE FIRST
TIME HE'S HAD THE NERVE

01:32.300 --> 01:34.052
TO DO IT ON THE AIR.

01:34.135 --> 01:35.303
- SO WHAT DID YOU SAY
TO HIM?

01:35.386 --> 01:37.347
- OH, I WENT BALLISTIC,
OF COURSE.

01:37.430 --> 01:39.015
AND THEN HE SAID WHAT
HE ALWAYS SAYS.

01:39.098 --> 01:41.351
"OH, GET OVER IT!"
- EW!

01:41.434 --> 01:43.186
I HATE WHEN MEN SAY
THINGS LIKE THAT.

01:43.269 --> 01:45.188
"GET OVER IT"
OR "JUST RELAX"

01:45.271 --> 01:48.650
OR "HOW DID YOU GET INTO MY
APARTMENT WITHOUT A KEY?"

01:48.733 --> 01:50.819
- ANYWAY, THIS TIME I DON'T
WANT TO GET OVER IT.

01:50.902 --> 01:52.320
I WANT TO GET EVEN.

01:52.403 --> 01:54.531
- WELL, YOU'VE COME
TO THE RIGHT PLACE.

01:54.614 --> 01:57.158
WHAT'S HIS HORSE'S HEAD?
- EXCUSE ME?

01:57.242 --> 01:58.576
- HIS WEAKNESS.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.161
YOU KNOW,
LIKE IN <i> THE GODFATHER,</i>

02:00.245 --> 02:02.205
WHERE THE GUY WAKES UP WITH HIS
HORSE'S HEAD IN THE BED.

02:02.288 --> 02:03.998
GOOD ONE THAT.
- OH, YEAH.

02:04.082 --> 02:06.167
WELL, COLIN CONSIDERS HIMSELF

02:06.251 --> 02:08.377
CLEVELAND'S
PREMIER LADIES MAN.

02:08.461 --> 02:10.713
YOU KNOW, HE PUMPS THEM UP
AND THEN SLEEPS WITH THEM

02:10.797 --> 02:13.216
AND DUMPS THEM AND BRAGS
ABOUT IT IN THE NEWSROOM.

02:13.299 --> 02:14.676
- HMM.
HAS HE EVER BEEN DUMPED?

02:14.759 --> 02:17.053
- NO, NO, HE PRIDES
HIMSELF ON THAT.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.680
- THEN THAT'S WHAT WE'LL DO.

02:18.763 --> 02:20.682
I'LL SEDUCE HIM,
LEAD HIM ON,

02:20.765 --> 02:23.059
THEN DUMP HIM IN ONE OF
THE HIDEOUSLY EMBARRASSING WAYS

02:23.143 --> 02:26.062
MEN HAVE ALWAYS DUMPED ME.

02:26.145 --> 02:29.399
IT'S ABOUT TIME I GAVE A MAN
A TASTE OF HIS OWN MEDICINE.

02:29.482 --> 02:32.318
LIKE THAT PHARMACIST I DATED.

02:32.402 --> 02:33.945
ONLY I DIDN'T KNOW
HE'D HAVE THAT REACTION

02:34.028 --> 02:36.698
TO HIS OWN MEDICINE.

02:36.781 --> 02:39.409
ANYWAY, THIS WILL BE FUN.
- [chuckles]

02:39.492 --> 02:41.911
AND I WON'T MICRO-MANAGE
YOUR METHOD.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.872
YOU KNOW, JUST BE SURE
THAT I AM THERE WHEN YOU DO IT,

02:43.955 --> 02:46.082
SO I CAN POP OUT AND SNEER,
"OH, GET OVER IT!"

02:46.165 --> 02:48.251
- [laughs]

02:48.334 --> 02:51.212
- YOU'LL NEVER BELIEVE
WHO I RAN INTO.

02:51.296 --> 02:53.715
DEAD WIFE GUY.

02:53.798 --> 02:56.759
- YOU MEAN THE GUY WHO ALMOST
THREW UP WHEN HE SAW YOU

02:56.843 --> 02:58.887
BECAUSE YOU LOOK
LIKE HIS DEAD WIFE?

02:58.970 --> 03:00.597
- YES.
DEAD WIFE GUY.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.765
WE HAD
A BEAUTIFUL CONVERSATION.

03:02.849 --> 03:03.975
HE ASKED ME OUT.

03:04.058 --> 03:05.643
AND GET THIS--HE IMPORTS

03:05.727 --> 03:08.021
ITALIAN...DESIGNER...SHOES.

03:08.104 --> 03:09.480
- NO!
- GET OUT!

03:09.564 --> 03:12.066
- YES, I GOT MYSELF
A NUMBER THREE

03:12.150 --> 03:13.735
ON THE PERFECT HUSBAND LIST.

03:13.818 --> 03:15.778
- I THOUGHT NUMBER THREE
WAS A PLASTIC SURGEON

03:15.862 --> 03:17.280
WHO LOOKS JUST LIKE
GEORGE CLOONEY.

03:17.363 --> 03:19.657
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
IT GOES ISLAND OWNER,

03:19.741 --> 03:21.784
PLASTIC SURGEON WHO LOOKS
LIKE GEORGE CLOONEY,

03:21.868 --> 03:23.494
IMPORTER OF DESIGNER SHOES,

03:23.578 --> 03:25.455
PLASTIC SURGEON WHO DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE GEORGE CLOONEY,

03:25.538 --> 03:27.498
AND ANY CHILDLESS
BILLIONAIRE WHO...

03:27.582 --> 03:29.125
all: JUST NEEDS A COMPANION

03:29.208 --> 03:32.921
FOR THE LAST TWO WEEKS
OF HIS LIFE.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.464
[tablet chiming]

03:34.547 --> 03:35.840
- OOO!
THAT MUST BE ELKA.

03:35.924 --> 03:38.176
SHE'S SKYPING IN
FROM EUROPE.

03:38.259 --> 03:41.471
-<i> BON JOUR!</i>
all: <i> BON JOUR.</i>

03:41.554 --> 03:44.807
- YOU KNOW, THE FOOD
HERE IN PARIS IS DELICIOUS.

03:44.891 --> 03:48.603
VICTORIA, YOU WOULD LOVE THIS
CHOCOLATE CROISSANT.

03:48.686 --> 03:50.521
HERE, HAVE A LICK.

04:09.749 --> 04:13.127
{\an8}- OH! I'M SORRY.
I MUST HAVE THE WRONG OFFICE.

04:13.211 --> 04:15.964
{\an8}- OR THE RIGHT ONE.

04:16.047 --> 04:17.923
{\an8}- WHAT'S YOUR HANDICAP?

04:18.007 --> 04:20.510
{\an8}- BEAUTIFUL BRUNETTES

04:20.593 --> 04:24.222
{\an8}- WAIT!

04:24.305 --> 04:26.557
{\an8}- YES, I GET THAT QUITE A LOT,

04:26.641 --> 04:29.477
{\an8}BEING COLIN COOPER AND ALL.

04:29.560 --> 04:31.688
{\an8}- YOUR THE MOST TRUSTED FACE
IN CLEVELAND BROADCASTING.

04:31.771 --> 04:34.857
{\an8}- IT'S THE REST OF ME YOU
GOTTA WORRY ABOUT.

04:34.941 --> 04:39.153
{\an8}- I'M JOY.
JOY SCROGGS.

04:39.237 --> 04:41.906
{\an8}BIG FAN.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.741
{\an8}- WELL, THANK YOU.

04:43.825 --> 04:46.202
{\an8}- MIND IF I PERCH?

04:46.286 --> 04:48.538
{\an8}- A LOVELY BIRD SHOULD PERCH.

04:48.621 --> 04:50.873
{\an8}- IT'S SUCH A PLEASURE
TO HEAR SOMEONE SPEAK

04:50.957 --> 04:54.752
{\an8}WITHOUT AN ACCENT.

04:54.836 --> 04:56.671
{\an8}- WELL, THEN I KNOW JUST WHERE
TO TAKE YOU FOR LUNCH.

04:56.754 --> 04:58.214
{\an8}THERE'S A BRAND-NEW PUB
DOWN ON PROSPECT.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.507
{\an8}FEELS JUST LIKE HOME.

04:59.590 --> 05:00.925
{\an8}PINTS OF LAGER,
STEAK AND KIDNEY PIE,

05:01.009 --> 05:02.051
{\an8}PLATES OF MUSHY PEAS.

05:02.135 --> 05:06.222
{\an8}- MMM! MUSHY PEAS.

05:06.305 --> 05:08.099
{\an8}- LET ME JUST RUN DOWN
TO THE SET AND GRAB MY JACKET

05:08.182 --> 05:09.559
{\an8}AND WE'LL HEAD OFF, EH?
- LOVELY.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.687
{\an8}- GOOD.

05:12.770 --> 05:14.105
{\an8}- SSS!

05:14.188 --> 05:16.899
{\an8}- JOY?
WHERE DID HE GO?

05:16.983 --> 05:18.526
{\an8}- OH, RELAX.
HE JUST WENT TO GET HIS JACKET.

05:18.609 --> 05:20.862
{\an8}IT IS GOING SPLENDIDLY.
- HEH!

05:20.945 --> 05:22.071
{\an8}- THERE'S SOMETHING FREEING
ABOUT HITTING ON A MAN

05:22.155 --> 05:24.115
{\an8}I KNOW I'M GONNA
BREAK UP WITH.

05:24.198 --> 05:25.867
YOU KNOW ME, IF I WERE
REALLY INTO THIS GUY,

05:25.950 --> 05:27.410
I'D BE NERVOUS,
SELF-CONSCIOUS, OBSESSIVE.

05:27.493 --> 05:31.247
- CLINGY, UNBALANCED,
INSECURE.

05:31.330 --> 05:34.208
WHAT?
YOU STARTED IT.

05:34.292 --> 05:36.044
- I LIKE BEING COOL JOY.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.754
I MEAN, THERE COULD BE
A NAKED WOMAN

05:37.837 --> 05:39.047
HIDING IN THAT CLOSET
RIGHT NOW

05:39.130 --> 05:41.424
AND I COULD NOT CARE LESS.
- OH, COME ON!

05:41.507 --> 05:43.801
NOW WHAT WOMAN IN THIS DAY
AND AGE WOULD HIDE IN A CLOSET?

05:43.885 --> 05:45.595
- I'VE GOT A LUNCH.
I'LL BE BACK IN AN HOUR.

05:49.515 --> 05:53.102
- YES, I AM AWARE
OF THE IRONY.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.438
- SHALL WE?
- LET'S.

05:55.521 --> 05:58.691
ME FIRST.

06:02.570 --> 06:05.823
- YOU KNOW, GUCCI IS ABOUT TO
UNVEIL A NEW SHOE.

06:05.907 --> 06:09.327
A SIX-INCH HEEL THAT ALSO
TONES YOUR THIGHS.

06:09.410 --> 06:12.163
- OH!

06:12.246 --> 06:15.792
SAY THAT AGAIN...
ONLY SLOWER.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.627
- I CAN GET YOU A SAMPLE.
- OH!

06:17.710 --> 06:19.462
I'M A 6-1/2!

06:19.545 --> 06:23.007
- OH. PERFECT SAMPLE SIZE.
[chuckles]

06:23.091 --> 06:24.634
YOU ABOUT READY TO
ORDER DESSERT?

06:24.717 --> 06:27.678
- OH, UH, LET'S SEE...
- EXCUSE ME.

06:27.762 --> 06:33.476
- I HAD BREAD, TWO GLASSES
OF WINE AND PASTA.

06:33.559 --> 06:35.645
SO I NEED TO FIND
SOMETHING CHOCOLATY

06:35.728 --> 06:37.438
THAT'S NEGATIVE
300 CALORIES.

06:37.522 --> 06:38.689
IS EVERYTHING
OKAY DOWN THERE?

06:38.773 --> 06:41.818
- OH, ALL GOOD.
- OH.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.444
- AH, I'M REALLY GLAD
YOU DECIDED TO

06:43.528 --> 06:44.821
GO OUT WITH ME AGAIN,
MELANIE.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.989
YOU REALLY ARE
THE PERFECT PACKAGE.

06:47.073 --> 06:48.366
FROM THE TOP
OF YOUR PRETTY HEAD

06:48.449 --> 06:50.284
ALL THE WAY DOWN TO YOUR...

06:50.368 --> 06:52.286
SUPER SEXY TOE CLEAVAGE.

07:00.920 --> 07:04.090
- I THINK DEAD WIFE GUY
MIGHT BE INTO FEET.

07:05.633 --> 07:09.345
WELL, NOT ALL FEET.
MY FEET.

07:09.428 --> 07:10.972
HE LIKES MY FEET.

07:11.055 --> 07:11.931
- OH, SO HE'S A SHRIMPER.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.685
- A WHAT?

07:15.768 --> 07:17.520
- A SHRIMPER.
A GUY WHO LIKES FEET.

07:17.603 --> 07:20.189
- WELL, ACTUALLY
TOES TO BE EXACT.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.525
- BECAUSE TOES LOOK JUST LIKE
BABY SHRIMP, ERGO SHRIMPER.

07:22.608 --> 07:25.194
- HMM.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.155
- WELL, WHEN YOU
PUT IT THAT WAY,

07:27.238 --> 07:31.325
YOU KNOW, IT'S...KINDA CUTE.

07:31.409 --> 07:33.202
AND MAYBE I'M WRONG.

07:33.286 --> 07:36.247
I MEAN, ALL HE DID WAS NOTICE
THAT I HAVE ATTRACTIVE FEET.

07:36.330 --> 07:38.166
- MELANIE,
MEN DON'T NOTICE FEET

07:38.249 --> 07:39.584
UNLESS THEY'RE INTO FEET.

07:39.667 --> 07:42.211
- YEAH, THEY BARELY
NOTICE FACES.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.380
[phone chimes]

07:44.463 --> 07:45.840
- [chuckles]

07:45.923 --> 07:47.842
- WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

07:47.925 --> 07:50.511
- OH, IT'S FROM COLIN.
PRIVATE JOKE ABOUT THE WELSH.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.847
[laughs]

07:52.930 --> 07:54.807
- YOU ALREADY HAVE
PRIVATE JOKES?

07:54.891 --> 07:56.726
OH! THAT IS SO DELICIOUS.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.769
HE IS NEVER GOING
TO SEE IT COMING.

07:58.853 --> 08:02.356
AH! I AM GOING TO SLEEP
LIKE A BABY TONIGHT.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.108
[phone chimes]

08:04.192 --> 08:06.068
- [chuckling]

08:06.152 --> 08:09.405
- YOU REALLY SEEM TO BE HAVING
A GOOD TIME WITH THIS GUY.

08:09.488 --> 08:11.908
ARE SURE YOU'RE NOT
FALLING FOR HIM?

08:11.991 --> 08:12.783
- OF COURSE NOT.
I WOULD NEVER FALL FOR HIM.

08:12.867 --> 08:13.784
THAT WOULD RUIN EVERYTHING.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.913
- YOU'RE A GOOD FRIEND, JOY.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.874
- I'VE FALLEN FOR HIM.
I'VE RUINED EVERYTHING!

08:25.671 --> 08:26.881
- HOW COULD YOU BE CRAZY
ABOUT HIM ALREADY?

08:26.964 --> 08:29.050
IT WAS JUST ONE LUNCH.
- A THREE-HOUR LUNCH

08:29.133 --> 08:30.801
WHERE WE NEVER STOPPED
LAUGHING OR TALKING

08:30.885 --> 08:33.261
OR FINISHING EACH
OTHER'S SENTENCES.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.265
I MEAN, SURE, HE'S POMPOUS
AND SMARMY AND ARROGANT.

08:36.349 --> 08:40.144
AND IN AN UGLIER MAN,
THAT WOULD BE UNATTRACTIVE.

08:40.227 --> 08:42.438
BUT YOU KNOW ME.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.899
GOOD-LOOKING BAD BOY.
THAT'S MY HORSE'S HEAD.

08:46.442 --> 08:49.278
[laughter]

08:49.362 --> 08:51.489
- YOU BOOBY-TRAPPED
THE DOUGHNUT BOX

08:51.572 --> 08:53.282
TO MAKE ME STORM IN HERE
LOOKING RIDICULOUS.

08:53.366 --> 08:56.327
WELL, IT DIDN'T WORK.

08:56.410 --> 08:58.204
- OH, COME ON, VICTORIA,

08:58.287 --> 09:00.081
YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY THINK
I MEANT THAT FOR YOU.

09:00.164 --> 09:01.415
YOU'RE THE ONE WHOSE ALWAYS
SAYING, "I NEVER EAT SWEETS.

09:01.499 --> 09:03.459
I'VE GOT WILLPOWER."

09:03.543 --> 09:05.962
- YEAH, WELL I WAS HAVING
A LOW BLOOD SUGAR MOMENT.

09:06.045 --> 09:07.964
- WELL, LISTEN, IF YOU'RE
STILL A BIT PECKISH,

09:08.047 --> 09:09.966
HAVE A THREE MUSKETEERS BAR.
MY TREAT.

09:10.049 --> 09:12.009
- THANK YOU.
- GOTCHA!

09:12.093 --> 09:15.471
- OH, YOU JUVENILE, PATHETIC...
- OH, GET OVER IT!

09:15.554 --> 09:17.598
[phone rings]

09:17.682 --> 09:20.101
COLIN COOPER.
OH, HI PHIL!

09:20.184 --> 09:21.644
YEAH, I CAN'T MAKE
THE POKER GAME TONIGHT.

09:21.727 --> 09:22.687
I'VE GOT A DATE.

09:22.770 --> 09:24.647
WELL, THAT'S JUST IT, MATE.

09:24.730 --> 09:25.940
I WOULD RATHER SPEND
POKER NIGHT WITH JOY

09:26.023 --> 09:26.983
'CAUSE I COULD SEE THIS
REALLY TURNING INTO

09:27.066 --> 09:28.693
SOMETHING SERIOUS.

09:28.776 --> 09:30.319
OH, SO I'M A WOMAN

09:30.403 --> 09:31.445
BECAUSE NOW I CARE
ABOUT SOMEONE.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.531
WELL, YOU'RE THE WOMAN!

09:33.614 --> 09:35.157
NO, JUST DON'T TELL
THE OTHER GUYS.

09:35.241 --> 09:37.868
JUST SAY I'M SICK
OR SOMETHING.

09:41.038 --> 09:42.540
- [exhales]

09:42.623 --> 09:45.001
- ARE YOU OKAY?
YOU SEEM A LITTLE NERVOUS.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.044
- NO, IT'S JUST THAT
I GOT YOU SOMETHING,

09:47.128 --> 09:51.340
AND I JUST HOPE
IT'S NOT TOO SOON.

09:51.424 --> 09:54.510
- OH, BILL.
IT'S A RING BOX.

09:54.593 --> 09:58.973
- IT MOST CERTAINLY IS.

09:59.056 --> 10:00.850
IT'S A TOE RING.

10:04.228 --> 10:06.814
- IT MOST CERTAINLY IS.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.029
- MAY I?

10:19.118 --> 10:20.328
- YES.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.997
[applause]

10:26.834 --> 10:29.837
patrons: EW! UGH!

10:35.676 --> 10:39.013
- BREAK OUT THE COCKTAIL SAUCE,
I'M DATING A SHRIMPER.

10:39.096 --> 10:40.848
- REALLY?

10:40.931 --> 10:43.392
YOU GONNA KEEP HIM
OR THROW HIM BACK?

10:43.476 --> 10:45.770
- KEEP HIM, I THINK.

10:45.853 --> 10:47.229
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY I MOVED
TO CLEVELAND.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.023
TO TRY NEW THINGS, RIGHT?

10:49.106 --> 10:51.859
I MEAN, HOW BAD COULD IT BE TO
HAVE A GUY WORSHIP YOUR FEET?

10:51.942 --> 10:53.694
- WOULDN'T KNOW.

10:53.778 --> 10:57.656
NEVER HAD A MAN TRAVEL
THAT FAR SOUTH.

10:57.740 --> 11:00.076
MOST JUST MAKE A QUICK STOP
AT THE EQUATOR,

11:00.159 --> 11:03.037
EMPTY MY FRIDGE,
AND PEEL OUT OF THE DRIVEWAY.

11:07.333 --> 11:11.045
- LADIES,
I HAVE FABULOUS NEWS!

11:11.128 --> 11:13.297
- YOU STARTED PLAYING
PAINTBALL?

11:13.381 --> 11:16.133
- OH, NO, NO, IT'S JUST
ANOTHER ONE OF COLIN'S PRANKS.

11:16.217 --> 11:18.928
WHICH MAKES MY FABULOUS NEWS
EVEN MORE ENJOYABLE.

11:19.011 --> 11:21.263
I OVERHEARD
COLIN ON THE PHONE.

11:21.347 --> 11:24.308
JOY, HE IS GENUINELY
CRAZY ABOUT YOU.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.435
- REALLY?
ARE YOU SURE?

11:26.519 --> 11:28.104
- NOT ONLY ARE YOU GOING
TO DESTROY HIS EGO,

11:28.187 --> 11:30.106
BUT YOU ARE GOING TO
BREAK THE HEART

11:30.189 --> 11:35.111
OF A MAN WHO TRULY THINKS
YOU HAVE A FUTURE TOGETHER.

11:35.194 --> 11:37.238
- YOU KNOW,
TO PROLONG HIS AGONY,

11:37.321 --> 11:39.907
MAYBE YOU SHOULD LET JOY
STRING HIM ALONG FOR A WHILE.

11:39.990 --> 11:41.283
- YES!

11:41.367 --> 11:45.162
LIKE AFTER CHRISTMAS
IN LONDON WITH MY FAMILY.

11:45.246 --> 11:48.249
THAT'LL REALLY GET HIM.
- NO, NO!

11:48.332 --> 11:51.252
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
NOW I HAD THIS ALL PLANNED.

11:51.335 --> 11:53.170
NO,, YOU WERE GOING TO
DUMP HIM ON THE PORCH TONIGHT.

11:53.254 --> 11:55.631
AND WHILE HE'S
REELING IN SHOCK,

11:55.714 --> 11:57.466
YOU'LL RING THE WIND CHIMES,
AND THAT'LL BE MY SIGNAL

11:57.550 --> 12:01.137
TO COME OUT AND GLOAT.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.930
- OH, SO NOW YOU LIKE
THE WIND CHIMES.

12:03.013 --> 12:04.223
WHEN I BOUGHT THEM
AT THE RENAISSANCE FAIR,

12:04.306 --> 12:05.683
YOU SAID THEY WERE STUPID.

12:05.766 --> 12:07.101
- YEAH, WELL THEY ARE STUPID,

12:07.184 --> 12:10.813
AND SO IS
THE RENAISSANCE FAIR.

12:10.896 --> 12:12.148
- OH, YEAH?
WELL THAT'S JUST BECAUSE

12:12.231 --> 12:16.318
YOU WEREN'T SELECTED TO
BE WENCH OF THE JOUST.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.946
- MMMAYBE.

12:19.029 --> 12:20.990
ANYWAY, THE IMPORTANT THING IS

12:21.073 --> 12:23.159
COLIN WILL NEVER BE ABLE
TO LOOK AT JOY AGAIN

12:23.242 --> 12:25.119
WITHOUT DISGUST
ND HEARTBREAK.

12:25.202 --> 12:27.371
OH!
IT'S JUST SO BEAUTIFUL.

12:34.545 --> 12:37.673
- COLIN, STOP!
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD--

12:37.756 --> 12:39.633
- SHOULD WHAT?

12:39.717 --> 12:42.219
- STOP KISSING.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.013
[wind chimes ring]

12:44.096 --> 12:45.639
- [loudly]
THAT WIND CHIME NOISE

12:45.723 --> 12:48.184
WAS CAUSED BY THE WIND!

12:48.267 --> 12:51.562
- ISN'T THAT USUALLY
THE CASE WITH WIND CHIMES?

12:51.645 --> 12:53.063
[wind chimes ring]

12:53.147 --> 12:55.149
- OH, NO, A SECOND CHIME!
YOU'VE GOT TO GO NOW!

12:55.232 --> 12:56.817
- YOU GONNA TURN INTO
A PUMPKIN OR SOMETHING?

12:56.901 --> 12:58.068
- I'LL EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING TOMORROW.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.403
JUST GO!

12:59.487 --> 13:01.697
TEXT ME!

13:01.780 --> 13:04.700
- OH, GET OVER IT--
WAIT, WHERE DID HE GO?

13:04.783 --> 13:06.035
I HEARD WIND CHIMES.

13:06.118 --> 13:09.371
- I DIDN'T BREAK UP
WITH HIM.

13:09.455 --> 13:10.706
- THERE'S JUST THIS THING
BETWEEN US.

13:10.789 --> 13:12.166
I CAN'T EXPLAIN IT.

13:12.249 --> 13:13.584
YOU KNOW THE THING
YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN.

13:13.667 --> 13:14.835
- YOU KNOW THE THING.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.212
- YEAH, WE ALL KNOW THE THING.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.839
WE'VE ALL DONE STUPID THINGS
FOR THE THING.

13:18.923 --> 13:21.175
AND IF YOU THINK
THAT THIS THING IS

13:21.258 --> 13:23.427
GOING TO TURN INTO
A BIGGER THING, THEN...

13:23.511 --> 13:25.679
WELL I WON'T STAND
IN YOUR WAY.

13:25.763 --> 13:28.724
I'LL JUST HAVE TO GET BACK
AT COLIN SOME OTHER WAY.

13:28.807 --> 13:30.726
- THANK YOU, VICTORIA.

13:30.809 --> 13:32.811
- ALL RIGHT.

13:32.895 --> 13:36.023
[phone chimes]

13:36.106 --> 13:37.691
- IT'S FROM COLIN.

13:37.775 --> 13:39.068
"LUNCH TOMORROW, BABY?"

13:39.151 --> 13:40.903
THAT'S WHAT HE CALLS ME.
"BABY."

13:40.986 --> 13:43.697
- AH.
- HMM!

13:43.781 --> 13:44.865
OH, GOD,
WHAT TERM OF ENDEARMENT

13:44.949 --> 13:47.243
SHOULD I WRITE BACK?
HONEY?

13:47.326 --> 13:48.744
SOUNDS LIKE
WE'RE OLD MARRIEDS.

13:48.827 --> 13:50.913
DUCKY?
WHO AM I, BENNY HILL?

13:50.996 --> 13:52.581
OH, GOD!
IT'S HAPPENING!

13:52.665 --> 13:55.751
I WAS COOL JOY WHEN I KNEW
IT WAS GOING TO END,

13:55.834 --> 13:57.920
BUT NOW THAT I CARE,
I'M NERVOUS AND INSECURE.

13:58.003 --> 14:01.257
- NO, NO, FIGHT IT.
YOU CAN BE COOL JOY AGAIN.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.300
JUST LIKE I'M COOL MELANIE
DATING A SHRIMPER.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.427
ME!

14:05.511 --> 14:06.971
- THAT'S RIGHT, JOY.

14:07.054 --> 14:08.597
I MEAN, IF SOMEONE
AS UPTIGHT AS MELANIE

14:08.681 --> 14:09.723
CAN DATE A PERVERT,

14:09.807 --> 14:12.434
THEN SURELY
THERE'S HOPE FOR YOU.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.603
- YOU ARE CRAZY.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.438
YOU'RE MUCH PRETTIER
THAN KEIRA KNIGHTLY.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.606
- OH, PLEASE.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.567
TELL ME MORE.

14:19.650 --> 14:21.610
AND SUPPORT YOUR ARGUMENT.

14:21.694 --> 14:22.653
- YOU SEEN HER FEET?

14:22.736 --> 14:24.071
SHE'S A TWO-SOCKER.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.783
YOU KNOW, BILL,
I'M GETTING A SENSE

14:27.866 --> 14:29.743
OF WHAT YOU'RE INTO,
AND IF I'M RIGHT,

14:29.827 --> 14:33.622
I AM WILLING TO...
DIP MY TOE IN THE WATER.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.749
- REALLY?

14:35.833 --> 14:38.127
- IT'S ALL NEW TO ME,
BUT I'M COOL.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.087
I'M COOL MELANIE
TRYING NEW THINGS.

14:40.170 --> 14:41.797
- WELL, FANTASTIC!

14:41.880 --> 14:44.300
WELL, THEN WOULD YOU BE UP
FOR A LITTLE ROLE PLAYING?

14:44.383 --> 14:46.093
- ROLE PLAYING?

14:46.176 --> 14:48.012
- YEAH, WITH--

14:48.095 --> 14:49.179
HANG YOUR FEET OFF
THE EDGE OF THE CHAIR THERE.

14:49.263 --> 14:51.932
LIKE THEY'RE STICKING OUT
OF THE WINDOW OF A PARKED CAR,

14:52.016 --> 14:55.436
AND I'LL BE THE OFFICER
PASSING BY.

14:59.023 --> 15:00.858
EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.

15:00.941 --> 15:02.943
I COULDN'T HELP
NOTICING YOUR FEET.

15:03.027 --> 15:06.322
- OH, SORRY.

15:06.405 --> 15:07.698
I WAS JUST...

15:07.781 --> 15:11.160
AIRING THEM OUT.

15:11.243 --> 15:14.371
- WELL, I'M AFRAID
I'M GONNA HAVE TO ARREST YOU

15:14.455 --> 15:16.457
FOR A DUI.

15:16.540 --> 15:20.836
DELICIOUSLY UNFORGETTABLE
INSTEP.

15:20.919 --> 15:22.880
- OH, OFFICER,

15:22.963 --> 15:24.923
COULDN'T YOU JUST LET ME OFF
WITH A WARNING?

15:25.007 --> 15:27.635
- WELL,
THERE'S ALSO THE ISSUE

15:27.718 --> 15:30.512
OF INDECENT EXPOSURE.

15:30.596 --> 15:32.681
BUT I COULD GIVE YOU
SOMETHING TO SLIP ON.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.225
- SHOE SAMPLE?

15:40.397 --> 15:43.108
- THIS ONE'S FOR YOU...

15:43.192 --> 15:47.488
CAUSE YOU'RE A GOOD GIRL.

15:47.571 --> 15:51.408
AND THIS ONE'S FOR YOU...

15:51.492 --> 15:53.577
CAUSE YOU'RE A BAD GIRL.

15:54.953 --> 15:56.997
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:59.792 --> 16:02.002
- HI! READY FOR LUNCH.

16:02.086 --> 16:05.172
- OY, YOU LOOK RAVISHING.
- THANK YOU.

16:05.255 --> 16:06.507
- HEY, DOES THIS
SOUND SCARY ENOUGH

16:06.590 --> 16:08.258
FOR THE 11:00 NEWS PROGRAM?

16:08.342 --> 16:09.927
"THERE'S A FLESH-EATING VIRUS
THAT MAY BE LURKING

16:10.010 --> 16:12.221
IN SOMETHING YOU AND YOUR
CHILDREN EAT EVERY DAY."

16:12.304 --> 16:14.264
- OH, MY GOD, IS THERE?

16:14.348 --> 16:15.933
- NO, THAT'S WHY I LEGALLY
HAVE TO SAY MAY BE.

16:16.016 --> 16:18.185
- OH, EXCUSE ME,
MR. COOPER?

16:18.268 --> 16:19.395
THEY NEED YOU
IN EDITING FOR A SECOND,

16:19.478 --> 16:20.437
AND THIS CAME FOR YOU.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.189
- THANKS, DEVON.

16:22.272 --> 16:23.899
- DEVON.

16:23.982 --> 16:25.442
IT'S A PRETTY NAME.
PRETTY GIRL.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.861
- YEAH, I SUPPOSE SO.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.113
- WHO'S THE GIFT FROM?

16:29.196 --> 16:30.030
- PROBABLY JUST A FAN.

16:30.114 --> 16:33.075
- HMM. A FAN
NAMED "LOVE YA, JENNIFER."

16:33.158 --> 16:34.702
WHO'S "LOVE YA, JENNIFER"?

16:34.785 --> 16:36.036
- I HAVEN'T A CLUE.

16:36.120 --> 16:38.038
I'LL MAKE THIS AS QUICK
AS I CAN, BABY.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.919
- COOL JOY.

16:44.002 --> 16:45.629
COOL JOY.

16:45.713 --> 16:48.924
COOL JOY.

16:49.007 --> 16:50.092
OH, SCREW IT!

16:50.175 --> 16:51.635
AAH!
- GOTCHA!

16:55.013 --> 16:57.391
- VICTORIA, YOU DID THIS?

16:57.474 --> 16:58.892
- JOY, THAT WAS MEANT
FOR COLIN.

16:58.976 --> 17:01.270
WHY DID YOU OPEN IT?
- IT WAS TAUNTING ME.

17:01.353 --> 17:03.063
I COULD HEAR IT SAYING,
"I'M FROM JENNIFER!

17:03.147 --> 17:05.315
"I'M 22!
I HAVE BIG BREASTS.

17:05.398 --> 17:07.401
COLIN AND I LAUGH ABOUT YOU
WHEN WE'RE HAVING GREAT SEX!"

17:07.483 --> 17:08.819
- ALL RIGHT, NOW I'M CONFUSED.

17:08.902 --> 17:11.238
ARE YOU THE BOX
OR ARE YOU JENNIFER?

17:11.320 --> 17:13.198
- HE'S COMING BACK!
HIDE IN YOUR CLOSET.

17:13.281 --> 17:15.451
- IT IS NOT MY CLOSET!
- JUST HIDE!

17:19.538 --> 17:22.915
SO, YOU'RE READY TO GO?

17:23.000 --> 17:25.294
- WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

17:25.377 --> 17:27.296
- I OPENED THE BOX.

17:27.378 --> 17:30.132
- VICTORIA.
I'M SORRY.

17:30.215 --> 17:33.093
THAT MUST HAVE BEEN
A PRACTICAL JOKE MEANT FOR ME.

17:33.177 --> 17:36.305
BUT, DARLING,
WHY DID YOU OPEN IT?

17:36.388 --> 17:40.684
- BECAUSE I GET CRAZY JEALOUS
WHEN I CARE ABOUT A MAN.

17:40.768 --> 17:42.603
ALSO CRAZY PARANOID.

17:42.686 --> 17:45.647
OH, AND CRAZY INSECURE.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.608
BUT FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGHT IT.

17:47.691 --> 17:49.318
BUT IT'S HARD.

17:49.401 --> 17:50.486
I JUST WANT TO BE HONEST
WITH YOU.

17:50.569 --> 17:52.279
- THEN I'LL BE HONEST
WITH YOU.

17:52.362 --> 17:54.448
I'VE BEEN FIGHTING
MY TRUE NATURE AS WELL.

17:54.531 --> 17:56.158
I'VE BEEN FAITHFUL TO YOU
SINCE WE'VE MET.

17:56.241 --> 17:59.495
AND IT'S KILLING ME.

17:59.578 --> 18:01.163
- WE MET EIGHT DAYS AGO.

18:01.246 --> 18:03.791
- I KNOW.
IT'S A PERSONAL BEST.

18:03.874 --> 18:06.502
- SO OUR FAKE SELVES
ARE COMPATIBLE,

18:06.585 --> 18:08.962
BUT OUR REAL SELVES
WOULDN'T STAND A CHANCE.

18:09.046 --> 18:12.049
INSANE JEALOUSY DOES NOT PAIR
WELL WITH SERIAL WOMANIZER.

18:12.132 --> 18:14.635
- NOT IN MY EXPERIENCE, NO.

18:14.718 --> 18:16.220
- ON THE OTHER HAND,

18:16.303 --> 18:19.723
MY REAL SAFE
AND MY FAKE SELF

18:19.807 --> 18:21.642
ARE INCREDIBLY ATTRACTED
TO YOU.

18:21.725 --> 18:23.143
- PLEASE TELL ME
AT LEAST ONE OF THEM

18:23.227 --> 18:25.479
IS ABOUT TO GET NAKED.

18:25.562 --> 18:28.774
- WELL, IT HAS BEEN
EIGHT DAYS.

18:28.857 --> 18:31.360
WAIT!
WHAT ABOUT MY GREEN FACE?

18:31.443 --> 18:32.820
- WHAT GREEN FACE?

18:32.903 --> 18:34.238
- MEN REALLY DON'T NOTICE
FACES, DO THEY?

18:34.321 --> 18:35.697
- I SHOULD WARN YOU.

18:35.781 --> 18:37.991
I NORMALLY BREAK UP WITH A WOMAN
ONCE I SLEEP WITH HER.

18:38.075 --> 18:39.701
- AND I SHOULD WARN YOU.

18:39.785 --> 18:40.994
SOMETHING WILL BE MISSING
FROM YOUR OFFICE TOMORROW,

18:41.078 --> 18:42.120
OR BROKEN OFF YOUR CAR.

18:42.204 --> 18:44.414
- FINE!
- FINE!

18:53.131 --> 18:54.883
- VICTORIA?
WHAT THE--

18:54.967 --> 18:57.511
- OH, GET OVER IT!

19:04.434 --> 19:05.894
- COMING UP NEXT.

19:05.978 --> 19:07.771
IS THERE SOMETHING
IN YOUR HOUSE

19:07.855 --> 19:09.731
THAT'S CAUSING YOU
AND YOUR CHILDREN

19:09.815 --> 19:11.441
TO GO BALD?

19:11.525 --> 19:13.360
THE ANSWER MAY SURPRISE YOU.

19:13.443 --> 19:15.320
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, COLIN?

19:20.951 --> 19:22.911
- HEH!
HOW DID YOU--

19:22.995 --> 19:24.204
- I SWITCHED OUT HIS SHAMPOO

19:24.288 --> 19:26.582
FOR SOMETHING
A LITTLE MORE POTENT.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.542
I DID IT FOR ME AND VICTORIA

19:28.625 --> 19:30.919
AND ALL THE OTHER WOMEN
HE'S DUMPED.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.713
ALTHOUGH I MUST SAY,

19:32.796 --> 19:35.674
HE LOOKS RATHER GOOD BALD,
DOESN'T HE?

19:35.757 --> 19:38.135
A LOT OF WOMEN FIND
THAT LOOK ATTRACTIVE.

19:38.218 --> 19:40.220
ME FOR INSTANCE.

19:40.304 --> 19:42.472
OH, GREAT, NOW HE'S GOING TO
HAVE EVEN MORE WOMEN,

19:42.556 --> 19:44.224
AND THERE'S NO CHANCE WE'LL
EVER GET BACK TOGETHER AGAIN.

19:44.308 --> 19:46.101
- [gasps]
I KNOW!

19:46.184 --> 19:48.270
I'LL PIN THIS ON VICTORIA.

19:48.353 --> 19:50.731
THAT WAY HE'LL NEED ME
TO GET BACK AT HER.

19:50.814 --> 19:52.566
I'LL MAKE IT UP
TO VICTORIA SOMEHOW.

19:52.649 --> 19:54.276
IT WILL ALL BE FINE
IN THE END.

19:54.359 --> 19:55.319
- GOOD NIGHT, JOY.

19:55.402 --> 19:57.070
- OH, GOOD NIGHT, MELANIE.

19:57.154 --> 19:59.615
MELANIE.

19:59.698 --> 20:02.576
THE ONLY PROBLEM
WITH THIS PLAN IS MELANIE.

20:02.659 --> 20:04.661
SHE KNOWS TOO MUCH.
