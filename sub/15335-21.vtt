IN 1783, NAPOLEON BET
MARIA LUIGIA THAT HE COULD
MAKE A PERFECT OMELET.

01:55.683 --> 02:00.120
THE SECRET, HE EXPLAINED, WAS
TO FLIP THE OMELET IN THE AIR
AND CATCH IT IN A FRYING PAN.

02:00.154 --> 02:02.223
WHEN NAPOLEON
FLIPPED THE OMELET,
IT FELL TO THE GROUND.

02:47.201 --> 02:49.303
YES. YOUR MATE
GAVE HIM A CONCUSSION,

02:49.337 --> 02:52.172

TURNED OVER...

02:52.206 --> 02:55.576

THIS COUNTRY INSTEAD OF THOSE

OUTLIVES HIS USEFULNESS,

WE FIND IN HIM,

THESE SAME SIGNS.

04:21.495 --> 04:24.231
FIRST, HE UNDERESTIMATES
THE DANGERS.
SECOND, HE GOES SOFT.

04:24.264 --> 04:28.469

IT MEANS HE BECOMES SENTIMENTAL,
BECOMES LESS AGGRESSIVE.
