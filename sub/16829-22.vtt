WEBVTT

00:02.136 --> 00:04.570
You are mine, tuxedo.

00:04.572 --> 00:05.771
I own you.

00:05.773 --> 00:07.139
Actually, it's a rental.

00:07.141 --> 00:08.207
That's not funny.

00:08.209 --> 00:09.641
CABE:
Hey, groom to be,

00:09.643 --> 00:12.411
I found those cufflinks
we were looking for.

00:13.381 --> 00:14.546
What's with Greg LeMond?

00:14.548 --> 00:16.215
He's trying to fit
into his wedding tux.

00:17.151 --> 00:18.150
CABE:
The wedding's tonight.

00:18.152 --> 00:19.251
Just get a bigger size.

00:19.253 --> 00:21.020
He refuses to.

00:21.022 --> 00:23.622
Happy saw Ryan Duckling
wearing a tux like that

00:23.624 --> 00:24.690
in a movie poster.

00:24.692 --> 00:26.859
TOBY:
It's Gosling.

00:26.860 --> 00:29.027
And she lingered.
She likes the threads.

00:29.030 --> 00:31.563
You ever think
she lingered on Gosling?

00:32.533 --> 00:34.466
No.

00:34.468 --> 00:36.101
Where are my test tubes?

00:36.103 --> 00:38.070
I'm trying to finish
a desalinization experiment.

00:38.072 --> 00:40.506
Maybe the new office manager
misplaced them.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.675
You throwing in the towel, Tubs?

00:43.677 --> 00:46.078
I have to work on my vows.

00:47.048 --> 00:49.365
A little long, don't you think?

00:49.366 --> 00:51.683
This is as concisely as I can
express my love for my love.

00:51.685 --> 00:52.618
HAPPY:
Walt,

00:52.620 --> 00:53.685
you wanted to see me?

00:53.687 --> 00:55.003
My love!

00:55.004 --> 00:56.320
I can't see you
before the wedding!

00:56.323 --> 00:58.690
You've seen me for years
before the wedding.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.192
Come on, it's tradition!

01:00.194 --> 01:02.428
I-I'm taking a shower.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.065
(screams)

01:08.102 --> 01:09.735
You're the one marrying him.

01:09.737 --> 01:11.336
WALTER:
So, we all know

01:11.338 --> 01:12.771
that wedding traditions
are stupid,

01:12.773 --> 01:16.075
but Toby won't shut up
about them, so,

01:16.077 --> 01:18.577
the dudes of honor have covered
the "four somethings."

01:18.579 --> 01:20.212
Your dress is the something new;

01:20.214 --> 01:22.114
the violets waiting at the venue
in San Jose

01:22.116 --> 01:22.848
are the something blue...

01:22.850 --> 01:24.416
And I covered the something old.

01:24.418 --> 01:26.418
You sure do.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.353
I meant the brooch
that I gave you.

01:28.355 --> 01:31.190
Yeah, that's...
that's what I meant.

01:31.192 --> 01:33.158
So, the something borrowed...

01:33.160 --> 01:34.660
A tie clip?
Yeah.

01:34.662 --> 01:37.429
I know I'm a tomboy, but I'm not
wearing a tie to my wedding.

01:37.431 --> 01:38.797
It's not just any tie clip.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.232
Seven years ago,

01:40.234 --> 01:42.101
the SoCal Fabrication
and Assembly Contest.

01:42.103 --> 01:44.103
Now, I was leaving
the convention center

01:44.105 --> 01:46.605
when I realized
that my clip fell off.

01:46.607 --> 01:49.541
And I went back in
and crossed paths

01:49.543 --> 01:52.411
with the greatest engineer
that I would ever know.

01:52.413 --> 01:54.646
Oh.

01:54.648 --> 01:57.216
Thank you.
Yeah.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.784
SYLVESTER (over intercom):
Hey, guys,
Paige's car pulled up.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.855
What?

02:02.857 --> 02:05.124
Might be a little uncomfortable,
don't you think?

02:05.126 --> 02:06.525
It's been many weeks.

02:06.527 --> 02:07.793
Paige is doing great.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.595
She's settled in
at Elia's company.

02:09.597 --> 02:12.264
It's not gonna be...
uncomfortable.

02:12.266 --> 02:14.266
She's fallen off the Earth
for the past month.

02:14.268 --> 02:16.902
She's so busy, she only calls
when wedding stuff comes up.

02:16.904 --> 02:18.821
Well, I'm not concerned.

02:18.822 --> 02:20.739
I will treat Paige as anyone
would treat any former employee,

02:20.741 --> 02:22.274
with cordial respect.

02:23.511 --> 02:27.913
Don't... screw up...
my... wedding.

02:33.154 --> 02:36.188
Never mess with a gal
on her wedding day.

02:39.360 --> 02:41.260
Sylvester!

02:41.262 --> 02:42.261
Aw, hey, pal!

02:42.263 --> 02:43.762
HAPPY:
We missed you, squirt.

02:43.764 --> 02:45.531
Too quiet around
here without you.

02:45.533 --> 02:46.865
Hi, everyone.

02:46.867 --> 02:48.367
Good to see you.

02:48.369 --> 02:50.435
Same here.
Hey, Waitress.

02:50.437 --> 02:51.703
SYLVESTER:
Hi, Paige.

02:51.705 --> 02:53.172
It's been a while.

02:53.174 --> 02:54.673
Yeah. I'm sorry
about that.

02:54.675 --> 02:57.643
Just real swamped
at the new job.

02:58.779 --> 03:01.246
I got Toby's shoes
shined for him,

03:01.248 --> 03:04.850
and, uh, came back to tackle a
few remaining best ma'am duties.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.519
Oh. Hello, Paige.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.224
I knew this would be weird.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.694
So, uh, you left a message

03:15.696 --> 03:18.597
about retrieving items, uh,
still left in your desk?

03:18.599 --> 03:20.732
Everything's here.
I packed them for you.

03:20.734 --> 03:23.235
Okay. Thank you. I was
gonna clean it out today.

03:23.237 --> 03:24.503
Sorry I waited so long.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.205
Elia's kept me really busy.

03:26.207 --> 03:27.606
WALTER:
Oh, no need.

03:27.608 --> 03:31.276
We just needed your, um,
desk empty for your replacement.

03:31.278 --> 03:32.511
Oh, you guys found somebody?

03:32.513 --> 03:33.912
That's great.
Glad you found help.

03:33.914 --> 03:36.281
Help? That's debatable.

03:36.283 --> 03:38.717
Smart snacks
for the cranium crew!

03:38.719 --> 03:41.486
Oh. Hello, Phyllis.

03:41.488 --> 03:43.055
Ray?
Look,

03:43.056 --> 03:44.623
we're a couple of professional
office managers, right?

03:44.625 --> 03:46.925
I see no reason
why we should feel ill at ease.

03:46.927 --> 03:48.794
Yeah, I'm fine with it.
I love my job.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.362
Oh, of course you do.

03:50.364 --> 03:51.930
Of course you do.

03:52.967 --> 03:56.835
Steak kabob? Sorry,
Peyton, employees only.

03:58.239 --> 03:59.905
This steak is raw.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.440
Yeah.

04:01.442 --> 04:03.709
Just like sushi.
No, not like sushi.

04:06.513 --> 04:08.547
So, where's Ralph?

04:08.549 --> 04:09.848
I didn't say "hi" to him.

04:09.850 --> 04:11.283
Well, I guess
I'll set up shop

04:11.285 --> 04:13.285
and get to, uh,
proofing Toby's vows.

04:13.287 --> 04:15.020
Yeah, if you could
just take a number,

04:15.022 --> 04:16.989
I'll help you
with that in a moment.

04:19.793 --> 04:22.394
I don't know, man.
He's got a system.

04:29.870 --> 04:32.671
Number seven?

04:32.673 --> 04:35.507
Hey, Ralph.

04:35.509 --> 04:38.310
So, I was thinking since
the wedding is on the beach,

04:38.312 --> 04:39.978
we could test out some
desalinization theories?

04:39.980 --> 04:41.680
Where's my centrifuge?

04:41.682 --> 04:43.448
Not sure.
Ray's reorganized.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.983
If it's lost,
you owe me a new one.

04:44.985 --> 04:46.985
Is something wrong?

04:46.987 --> 04:49.354
Other than the fact
you fired my mom?

04:51.825 --> 04:53.325
I didn't fire her.

04:53.327 --> 04:54.993
Her skill set wasn't
needed anymore

04:54.995 --> 04:56.962
because she was so good
at her job

04:56.964 --> 04:58.597
that everyone
at Scorpion evolved.

04:58.599 --> 05:01.500
SYLVESTER:
Cabe! Happy's chasing
me with raw meat!

05:01.502 --> 05:02.734
More or less.

05:02.736 --> 05:04.536
You're forgetting one thing.

05:04.538 --> 05:07.706
I'm smarter than you,
and I know why you fired my mom.

05:07.708 --> 05:09.308
Because you're a coward

05:09.310 --> 05:11.076
who can't face
how he feels about her.

05:11.078 --> 05:13.378
Ralph, you're just a kid.
You don't understand...

05:13.380 --> 05:14.746
I understand

05:14.748 --> 05:17.516
today's about Happy and Toby,
so we're done talking.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.786
And you're lucky I'm a kid.

05:20.788 --> 05:23.088
If I was bigger,
I would fight you.

05:24.858 --> 05:26.925
You hurt my mother.

05:30.597 --> 05:32.664
(phone ringing)

05:34.735 --> 05:36.635
Yes, Scorpion.

05:36.637 --> 05:40.939
Ah, the ancient tradition of
steam blasting a wedding ring.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.574
I'm gonna make
this sucker shine.

05:42.576 --> 05:43.809
I read his vows.

05:43.811 --> 05:45.744
Tough act to follow.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.346
Well, I'm gonna wing it.

05:47.348 --> 05:48.714
"Toby, you and me work.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.015
Glad we're getting hitched."

05:50.017 --> 05:53.051
Flowery speeches
are not my thing.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.586
Well, it's not hard.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.455
You just express what you feel,

05:56.457 --> 05:58.123
say what's in your heart.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.624
Oxygenated blood.

05:59.626 --> 06:00.992
Maybe I can't help.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.694
WALTER:
Team?

06:02.696 --> 06:03.895
We have an urgent case.

06:03.897 --> 06:05.364
TOBY:
No!

06:05.366 --> 06:07.466
No cases on our wedding day!

06:07.468 --> 06:08.767
We have no choice.
It's serious.

06:08.769 --> 06:11.303
TOBY:
<i>I'm</i> serious.

06:11.304 --> 06:13.838
I-I had to propose twice,
and fight immigration services

06:13.841 --> 06:15.941
and-and wait for a divorce
to get to this day.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.075
I'm not risking it.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.110
Why is he wearing a mask?

06:18.112 --> 06:19.578
Oh, my God, is Paige here?

06:19.580 --> 06:21.547
Hey, Paige.

06:21.548 --> 06:23.515
Walt's right. Just got an
e-mail report from Homeland.

06:23.517 --> 06:26.385
Lightning strikes
set fire to an underground

06:26.387 --> 06:28.653
coal seam
in East Lake, Wyoming.

06:28.655 --> 06:30.489
Wyoming? We got
to be in San Jose.

06:30.491 --> 06:31.707
WALTER:
Understood.

06:31.708 --> 06:32.924
But based
on ground temperature readings

06:32.926 --> 06:34.092
and smoke rising

06:34.094 --> 06:35.394
from cracks in the earth,
it's believed

06:35.396 --> 06:36.695
that this fire is heading

06:36.696 --> 06:37.995
for a subterranean
telecom cable

06:37.998 --> 06:39.664
responsible
for all communications

06:39.666 --> 06:40.799
west of the Mississippi.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.067
SYLVESTER:
Affects more than phones.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.669
Hospitals, airports
and emergency services.

06:44.671 --> 06:47.072
Mines in Wyoming
are a century old.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.908
Hundreds of veins,
some collapsed, some shifted.

06:49.910 --> 06:51.777
Hardly any
old maps exist.

06:51.779 --> 06:53.712
No one knows
where the fire is underfoot.

06:53.714 --> 06:54.980
Now I see why it's so urgent.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.838
(clears throat)

06:56.839 --> 06:58.695
Not really your purview
anymore, Prudy.

06:58.696 --> 07:00.552
WALTER:
So, to stop the fire
from hitting the telecom cable,

07:00.554 --> 07:03.188
we have to pinpoint the exact
edges of the burning vein

07:03.190 --> 07:04.556
and extinguish it.
SYLVESTER:
We can use

07:04.558 --> 07:05.841
the imaging tech we used

07:05.842 --> 07:07.125
to locate those hikers
in the forest fire

07:07.127 --> 07:08.644
two years ago.

07:08.645 --> 07:10.162
We just need to add
a thermal component so we can

07:10.164 --> 07:12.697
detect the fire path.
HAPPY: We can link it
to one of Homeland's

07:12.699 --> 07:15.200
surveillance satellites
and get a whole vein layout

07:15.202 --> 07:16.802
in one aerial shot.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.203
What about the wedding?

07:18.205 --> 07:19.704
(clears his throat)
PAIGE:
It's about

07:19.706 --> 07:20.972
the wedding, not work.

07:20.974 --> 07:23.108
I'll allow it.

07:23.110 --> 07:26.445
If we spend no more than 72
minutes working on the case,

07:26.447 --> 07:29.581
we can catch a flight and make
the wedding with time to spare.

07:29.583 --> 07:30.816
Yeah, the job should be
relatively quick,

07:30.818 --> 07:32.217
and we can't just
let the fire burn.

07:32.219 --> 07:34.119
SYLVESTER:
We'll need the garage's
computing power

07:34.121 --> 07:35.821
to run the imaging
technology.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.356
I'll-I'll do it!

07:37.357 --> 07:38.890
I mean, I don't want
to see Happy until tonight,

07:38.892 --> 07:40.592
so I'll just stay back.

07:40.594 --> 07:41.827
And I'll handle
all the wedding details,

07:41.829 --> 07:43.462
make sure everything
gets up to San Jose.

07:43.464 --> 07:45.030
And Toby and I'll
see you at the altar.

07:45.032 --> 07:47.866
Where's the file from
the forest fire job?

07:47.868 --> 07:50.135
I have to review
imaging software specs.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.703
Everything is disorganized.

07:51.705 --> 07:52.971
RAY:
Nope!

07:52.973 --> 07:55.006
I placed the cases
in order of excitement.

07:55.008 --> 07:57.776
Forest fire is super exciting.
Should be up front, okay?

07:57.778 --> 07:59.845
Number eight?

08:03.817 --> 08:05.217
Three minutes ahead of schedule!

08:05.219 --> 08:06.952
Well, you're either
Team Scorpion,

08:06.954 --> 08:08.854
or the strangest cowboys
I've ever seen.

08:08.856 --> 08:10.555
Cabe Gallo,
Homeland Security.

08:10.557 --> 08:12.958
This is Scorpion's
founder, Walter O'Brien.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.960
Michelle Bannister. I'm
emergency services coordinator

08:14.962 --> 08:17.262
for East Lake County.

08:17.263 --> 08:19.563
You had asked for the
environmental impact studies

08:19.566 --> 08:20.966
from the telecom company's
cable installation

08:20.968 --> 08:23.035
from a few years back,

08:23.036 --> 08:25.103
amongst a few other strange
requests made by your team.

08:25.105 --> 08:28.106
Yes, I see the tractor-mounted
bored pile drill we asked for.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.274
HAPPY:
Did you also get the

08:29.276 --> 08:32.677
diisocyanate and
polyether polyol?

08:32.679 --> 08:34.246
And the balloons
and the Fruity Moons?

08:34.248 --> 08:35.580
Yeah, all in the truck.

08:35.582 --> 08:36.715
WALTER:
The study indicates

08:36.717 --> 08:38.617
low thermal conductivity
in the soil,

08:38.619 --> 08:40.752
so our foam fix
should work flawlessly.

08:40.754 --> 08:43.855
Good, 'cause our county has been
on some hard times for a while.

08:43.857 --> 08:44.990
We've done everything

08:44.992 --> 08:46.992
from leasing land
to telecom companies

08:46.994 --> 08:48.627
to building nuclear waste
storage facilities

08:48.629 --> 08:50.128
to get by, so...

08:50.130 --> 08:53.031
East Lake is strong, but even
the strongest can say "uncle."

08:53.033 --> 08:54.866
Well, it will not
come to that.

08:54.868 --> 08:59.938
In the meantime, here is
an ear comm for communication.

08:59.940 --> 09:02.240
And if you can show us where
there is evidence of the fire,

09:02.242 --> 09:03.542
we can get to work.

09:03.544 --> 09:05.310
SYLVESTER:
Toby,

09:05.312 --> 09:07.546
I've got the satellite pointed
at our current location.

09:07.548 --> 09:09.948
You should be receiving
thermal imaging... now.

09:09.950 --> 09:11.650
Yeah, I got it. Okay.

09:11.652 --> 09:13.151
Drill the final hole

09:13.153 --> 09:15.620
650 feet northeast
of your current location.

09:15.622 --> 09:18.957
Hey, Paige?
What's up? You need
my help with the case?

09:18.959 --> 09:21.560
No. I was wondering if you could
move the part of my vows

09:21.562 --> 09:24.729
where I compare myself and Happy
to Han Solo and Princess Leia

09:24.731 --> 09:26.197
to the top of page three.

09:26.199 --> 09:27.766
It'll flow better.

09:27.768 --> 09:30.068
Sure thing.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.137
Feet off the furniture.

09:35.776 --> 09:38.176
Almost done. You sure this is
the last one we'll need?

09:38.178 --> 09:41.212
Should be. The three holes that
you dug are strategically placed

09:41.214 --> 09:44.049
to extinguish the fire, and the
first hole worked perfectly.

09:44.051 --> 09:46.851
Can't believe you guys can
put out the fire with stuff

09:46.853 --> 09:48.787
I got from an industrial plant
and the market.

09:48.789 --> 09:50.689
Well, it's simple really.

09:50.691 --> 09:53.892
The polyether polyol mixes
with the diisocyanate,

09:53.894 --> 09:55.894
which mixes with the sugar
in the Fruity Moons

09:55.896 --> 09:57.362
that dissipates
at an even rate

09:57.364 --> 10:00.865
when the marshmallows dissolve,
creating an expanding foam

10:00.867 --> 10:02.701
that clogs the coal vein's
air pockets,

10:02.703 --> 10:04.669
depriving the fire of O2.

10:04.671 --> 10:07.339
All right.

10:07.341 --> 10:09.040
Bombs away.

10:15.616 --> 10:17.182
The other hole
foamed up right away.

10:17.184 --> 10:19.651
Well, the mixtures aren't exact,

10:19.653 --> 10:22.087
but the reaction should be
going on as we speak.

10:22.089 --> 10:23.922
Lots of air pockets to fill.

10:25.258 --> 10:27.926
Oh, there's the foam!

10:27.928 --> 10:30.195
Second part of
the underground fire choked off.

10:30.197 --> 10:31.963
All right, one more to go.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.232
Happy, we'll be on a plane back
to wedding bells

10:34.234 --> 10:35.634
in less than 40 minutes!

10:35.636 --> 10:37.702
Nice work, team!

10:38.639 --> 10:40.672
Marching. Cross, open

10:40.674 --> 10:42.674
cross, down, out.

10:42.676 --> 10:44.209
A minute of your time,
Ms. Fonda?

10:44.211 --> 10:46.344
Yeah, sure. Got to chat
while burning fat.

10:46.346 --> 10:47.345
Fine. Lose the comm.

10:47.347 --> 10:49.047
You know how Happy said

10:49.049 --> 10:51.783
she doesn't give you
a lot of "attaboys"

10:51.785 --> 10:53.351
'cause she just isn't
super expressive?
Yeah.

10:53.353 --> 10:54.352
Look out.

10:54.354 --> 10:55.253
Time for kicks.

10:55.255 --> 10:57.355
Okay.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.424
How do you think she'll feel

10:59.426 --> 11:00.959
when she has nothing
for her vows

11:00.961 --> 11:03.695
and you have, like,
<i> War and Peace? </i>
Oh, please.

11:03.697 --> 11:05.997
Happy's used to being
Marcel Marceau to my Bozo.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.766
It'll make her feel bad.

11:07.768 --> 11:09.100
No, she's the blacksmith.

11:09.102 --> 11:11.002
I'm the wordsmith.
Stop worrying.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.738
Update: all the flights
out of Wyoming are on schedule.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.073
(grunts)

11:15.075 --> 11:16.741
All is well.

11:16.743 --> 11:18.043
Good, 'cause we just plugged
the last hole.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.277
We are officially done.

11:19.279 --> 11:20.712
(computer beeps)
Uh, Walt, Walt.

11:20.714 --> 11:23.081
No, no, no. Don't punch out yet.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.749
Um, imagery's picking up a fire.

11:24.751 --> 11:26.384
Erupted in an unconnected vein

11:26.386 --> 11:28.286
50 feet
under your current location.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.888
It's deeper than the one
you put out,

11:29.890 --> 11:31.406
and it's two or three times
as strong.

11:31.407 --> 11:32.923
How does this happen?
I'm putting you guys on speaker.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.059
Oh, you know,
that's company equipment.

11:34.061 --> 11:35.544
Ow!

11:35.545 --> 11:37.028
I'm pretty sure that
the vein that Toby sees

11:37.030 --> 11:39.330
is this one right here,
and that's an issue.

11:39.332 --> 11:41.766
Why?
Because it leads there.

11:41.768 --> 11:44.169
The East Lake
Nuclear Waste Depot.
TOBY: This seam

11:44.171 --> 11:45.270
is double the size

11:45.272 --> 11:46.855
of the one you put out.
Foam won't work.

11:46.856 --> 11:48.439
WALTER: Well, we better think
of something that will,

11:48.442 --> 11:49.441
'cause if the fire reaches

11:49.443 --> 11:50.809
the nuclear depot,

11:50.811 --> 11:52.077
the whole county
goes up in a fireball.

11:52.079 --> 11:56.047
Looks like they're gonna need
a later flight.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.116
♪ ♪

12:05.859 --> 12:08.393
This shouldn't have happened.
The environmental impact study

12:08.395 --> 12:11.129
says the thermal conductivity
of the soil in this valley

12:11.131 --> 12:12.797
is .54 watts per meter.

12:12.799 --> 12:14.299
At those numbers,
the fire should've never spread.

12:14.301 --> 12:15.433
It's impossible.

12:15.435 --> 12:16.267
TOBY:
About that...

12:16.269 --> 12:17.268
I pulled data

12:17.270 --> 12:18.870
on the Dapperford Group,

12:18.872 --> 12:21.306
the firm that did
the environmental impact study.

12:21.308 --> 12:23.875
Turns out they're owned
by a shell corporation

12:23.877 --> 12:26.277
that is a subsidiary
of the very telecom company

12:26.279 --> 12:27.879
that hired them
in the first place.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.047
They brought in a home town ref.

12:29.049 --> 12:30.699
WALTER: So
the soil

12:30.700 --> 12:32.350
was more conductive to heat
than we'd been led to believe.

12:32.352 --> 12:34.385
Now we know how the fire
jumped to another vein.

12:34.387 --> 12:35.854
Issue is how do we stop it

12:35.856 --> 12:37.288
before it reaches
the nuke depot?

12:37.290 --> 12:38.456
Do you have any more
of those old maps?

12:38.458 --> 12:39.824
Yeah, in the cab.

12:39.826 --> 12:41.426
I'll notify Homeland.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.294
Now, if the burning vein

12:43.296 --> 12:44.963
rises further along its route,

12:44.965 --> 12:48.333
it might get shallow enough
for us to use the foam.

12:48.335 --> 12:51.770
We need a raise in the vein
within 30 feet of the surface.

12:51.772 --> 12:53.805
Can't believe
you still have all this.

12:53.807 --> 12:56.174
Pitfall of being East Lake's
unofficial historian.

12:56.176 --> 12:58.777
Okay, this map seems to follow
the vein in question

12:58.779 --> 12:59.911
till its end...

12:59.913 --> 13:01.179
and it never rises.

13:01.181 --> 13:02.447
So there's no solution?

13:02.449 --> 13:03.548
Not necessarily.

13:03.550 --> 13:06.084
The vein runs
through a sand pit.

13:06.086 --> 13:08.052
WALTER:
Sand pit.

13:08.054 --> 13:09.187
That's perfect.

13:09.189 --> 13:10.455
Lightning started this fire,

13:10.457 --> 13:11.890
now it's gonna put it out.
That's brilliant.

13:11.892 --> 13:12.891
I'm so... I have no idea

13:12.893 --> 13:14.025
what you're talking about.

13:14.027 --> 13:15.794
Sand is made out of silica

13:15.796 --> 13:17.495
that when heated
to 1,600 degrees Celsius

13:17.497 --> 13:18.830
turns to glass.

13:18.832 --> 13:19.931
Coal fires only burn

13:19.933 --> 13:21.065
at a thousand degrees Celsius.

13:21.067 --> 13:22.167
But if we can create

13:22.169 --> 13:23.168
a 20,000 volt lightning strike

13:23.170 --> 13:24.235
in the sand pit...

13:24.237 --> 13:26.171
That'll create a glass barrier

13:26.173 --> 13:28.373
in the middle of the coal vein,
cutting off the fire

13:28.375 --> 13:29.340
from the depot.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.942
Okay, but how are you gonna

13:30.944 --> 13:32.277
create a lightning strike?

13:32.279 --> 13:33.545
Sand's an insulator.

13:33.547 --> 13:35.246
We'll wet it
with saline solution

13:35.248 --> 13:36.447
so it conducts electricity.

13:36.449 --> 13:37.832
We use some kind of metal

13:37.833 --> 13:39.216
to create a positive plate
on top of the pit

13:39.219 --> 13:41.820
and a negative plate
underneath the coal vein.

13:41.822 --> 13:44.088
Then we shoot the current
from top to bottom.

13:44.090 --> 13:46.424
Now, I assume as
Emergency Services Coordinator

13:46.426 --> 13:48.092
that you have to deal
with deicing roads

13:48.094 --> 13:49.294
during the winter?
Now, who handles that?

13:49.296 --> 13:50.962
Uh, the fire department
has a spreader.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.831
Great. Have them bring over
a fire truck.

13:52.833 --> 13:55.133
Fill the water tank with deicer
to make a saline solution.

13:55.135 --> 13:56.501
According to this, a mine shaft

13:56.503 --> 13:58.369
is directly beneath
the sand pit.

13:58.371 --> 13:59.571
We'll put the negative plate
there.

13:59.573 --> 14:01.105
Okay.
Cabe and I can handle that.

14:01.107 --> 14:02.841
Handle what?

14:02.842 --> 14:04.576
We're gonna create a
lightning-level charge

14:04.578 --> 14:07.278
and turn sand to
glass. Let's go.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.848
This is what happens
when you step away for a minute.

14:09.850 --> 14:12.383
Sly and I will take care
of the positive charge.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.419
We'll need three car hoods,

14:14.421 --> 14:16.120
so we got to get our hands
on two more vehicles.

14:16.122 --> 14:17.188
There's a ranch nearby.
(car starts)

14:17.190 --> 14:18.523
Okay, good. Tell the fire chief

14:18.525 --> 14:21.392
we need four jumper cables
and copper wire.
Okay.

14:21.394 --> 14:24.195
You better get this set up ASAP,
'cause thermal images show

14:24.197 --> 14:25.714
the fire burning faster

14:25.715 --> 14:27.232
and getting closer to
the nuclear depot by the minute.

14:27.234 --> 14:29.400
No, we are not canceling
the wedding. We just need

14:29.402 --> 14:30.468
to push it by...

14:30.470 --> 14:32.037
two hours.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.605
WOMAN:
But, ma'am...
Look, you are not a cheap venue,

14:33.607 --> 14:35.540
and we are paying you
a lot of money,

14:35.542 --> 14:37.308
so just entertain the guests
until we get there.

14:37.310 --> 14:39.344
Hold on, this might be
the Justice of the Peace

14:39.346 --> 14:40.478
on the other line? Hello?

14:40.480 --> 14:41.546
MAN:
Hi, Miss Dineen.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.214
It's Vance
from Health & Wellness.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.949
Noticed you're not
in the office today

14:44.951 --> 14:46.584
and was checking to see
if you're under the weather

14:46.586 --> 14:48.553
and if we could get you
anything.

14:48.555 --> 14:49.921
No, I'm fine.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.189
It's just a personal day.

14:51.191 --> 14:53.324
Very well.
Would you like lunch delivered?

14:53.326 --> 14:55.260
Raul made a lov...
(phone beeps)

14:55.262 --> 14:57.462
TOBY:
I'm so sorry. Elia provides you

14:57.464 --> 14:59.464
with a personal chef?

14:59.466 --> 15:01.165
And a health center? And...

15:01.167 --> 15:03.635
And a very, very fancy
Wow.

15:03.637 --> 15:05.603
new phone.
That is nice. Look at that case.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.572
Guess this new gig's
got you hooked up

15:07.574 --> 15:09.908
with everything but your
own assistant, hmm?
(chuckles)

15:11.177 --> 15:12.944
Holy crap.
You have an assistant.

15:13.680 --> 15:15.647
Hey, man, I'm kind of
like your assistant.

15:15.649 --> 15:17.866
You're exactly like a vagrant

15:17.867 --> 15:20.084
who lives in a trailer
in the back of a garage.
Wow. (sighs)

15:20.086 --> 15:22.553
You're really just living
the high life now.

15:24.291 --> 15:27.525
Guess that's why we, uh,
don't hear from you anymore.

15:27.527 --> 15:30.194
Toby, I was dismissed
from the job here.

15:30.196 --> 15:31.262
I know.

15:31.264 --> 15:32.463
You know
that you weren't dismissed

15:32.465 --> 15:34.933
from the rest of us, right?

15:34.935 --> 15:38.603
You... You kind of ditched us.

15:40.073 --> 15:44.108
That's all I'm saying.

15:46.146 --> 15:47.478
It was your father,
rest his soul,

15:47.480 --> 15:49.981
told me to get a bigger tanker
back in '84.

15:49.983 --> 15:52.083
He was always smarter
than the rest of us.

15:52.085 --> 15:53.217
HAPPY: Chief,
blast the hose

15:53.219 --> 15:54.585
and salinate the sand.

15:54.587 --> 15:57.021
Sly, let's wire up these hoods.

15:59.426 --> 16:01.092
Found these inside.

16:01.094 --> 16:03.361
Perfect to create
the negative plate.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.229
I got flashlights
and a wire I tore

16:05.231 --> 16:07.165
out of the SUV's speakers.

16:07.166 --> 16:09.100
We never get our deposit back
on rental cars, do we?

16:09.102 --> 16:10.702
(chuckles)

16:10.704 --> 16:12.370
Almost done
with this contraption.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.038
Damn it.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.440
We're short on the wiring.

16:15.442 --> 16:16.641
I'll run to town and get more.

16:16.643 --> 16:18.376
I am looking at sat-data.

16:18.378 --> 16:21.379
I can assure you,
you do not have time.

16:21.381 --> 16:23.648
There's less than 14 minutes
until that depot goes kablooey.

16:23.650 --> 16:25.283
Dig up these hoods
and move 'em closer.

16:25.285 --> 16:27.285
Even less time for that.

16:27.286 --> 16:29.286
Walt, you know that sweet,
sentimental tie clip

16:29.289 --> 16:31.556
you gave me? I am using it
as a thermal bridge,

16:31.558 --> 16:32.991
and it's gonna melt.

16:32.993 --> 16:34.392
That's okay.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.060
It was only three dollars.

16:44.137 --> 16:47.071
Okay. By revving
the engines,

16:47.073 --> 16:48.740
we build the charge
to the exact point

16:48.742 --> 16:50.341
necessary to overcome
the sand's resistance.

16:50.343 --> 16:53.244
Then the voltage will
hit the negative plate

16:53.246 --> 16:55.179
that Walter's putting
into place.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.148
SYLVESTER:
Bam! Instant glass barrier.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.416
I'm not sure about that.

16:58.418 --> 16:59.751
Must've been a cave in.

16:59.753 --> 17:01.052
Track's blocked.

17:01.054 --> 17:02.353
We can't get under the sand pit.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.755
And we can't stop the fire.

17:08.328 --> 17:09.694
Guys, the fire passes through
the sand pit in less than

17:09.696 --> 17:12.096
eight minutes,
and then it's full speed ahead

17:12.098 --> 17:13.131
to the nuclear depot.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.499
Happy, I can't marry you

17:14.501 --> 17:15.633
if you're blown to pieces.

17:15.635 --> 17:18.102
You got a lot less
than eight minutes.

17:18.104 --> 17:19.404
The indicators are showing

17:19.406 --> 17:21.272
that we've almost drained
the trucks' batteries

17:21.274 --> 17:22.807
and fully charged that sand pit,

17:22.809 --> 17:24.509
and once it's saturated
with energy,

17:24.511 --> 17:26.811
it's gonna shoot excess
voltage down into the earth.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.212
But if it unloads

17:28.214 --> 17:30.248
before the negative plate's
in place,

17:30.250 --> 17:32.050
then it'll just pass
through the ground

17:32.052 --> 17:33.518
and we get no glass wall.

17:33.520 --> 17:35.086
Then delay the charge.

17:35.088 --> 17:36.687
No, if we stop building up now,

17:36.689 --> 17:38.589
it'll take too long
to get it started again.

17:38.591 --> 17:40.124
Walter, for the
sake of your lives

17:40.126 --> 17:42.126
and for the sake of all
skinny little nerdy kids

17:42.128 --> 17:44.295
who no one ever thinks will grow
up to land a super-hot wife,

17:44.297 --> 17:46.214
get through that damn cave-in.

17:46.215 --> 17:48.132
Well, the rocks are too heavy
to move ourselves, so...

17:48.134 --> 17:50.635
But we can use

17:50.637 --> 17:53.171
that old coal bin to strike the
cave-in like a battering ram.

17:53.173 --> 17:55.139
Thing's 80 years old.

17:55.141 --> 17:56.774
There's no way it's gonna
breach that rock wall.

17:56.776 --> 17:58.109
Not on its own.

17:58.111 --> 18:00.211
But if we can increase its mass,

18:00.213 --> 18:02.413
then the force
will be great enough.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.781
Here, Ralph?

18:03.783 --> 18:05.149
I'm sending you photos

18:05.151 --> 18:08.152
of the handcar and the cave-in.

18:08.154 --> 18:10.455
Now estimate the dimensions

18:10.457 --> 18:12.857
and figure out
any additional velocity or mass

18:12.859 --> 18:15.326
that we'll need.
Got the photos.
Give me a second.

18:15.328 --> 18:18.463
Okay. In the spirit
of staying positive,

18:18.465 --> 18:21.132
I found a bunch
of connecting flights that work,

18:21.134 --> 18:23.201
and if they can just get through
that rubble tout suite,

18:23.203 --> 18:25.803
they should be able
to get to the wedding on time.
Thanks.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.438
That's what I do.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.574
San José, Costa Rica?
Mm-hmm.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.676
They're getting married
in San Jose, California.

18:31.678 --> 18:33.811
Uh, San Jose,
California's a myth.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.413
Excuse me?

18:35.415 --> 18:36.747
It's not real, brother.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.182
Like Tallahassee.

18:38.184 --> 18:39.450
Tallahassee's real.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.551
Is it?

18:40.553 --> 18:42.203
Paige, please.

18:42.204 --> 18:43.854
I know you tried your best,
but I'm taking over.

18:43.857 --> 18:45.423
After the guys are safe,

18:45.425 --> 18:46.858
I'm handling the wedding stuff.

18:46.860 --> 18:48.392
Only chance of them being safe

18:48.394 --> 18:50.461
is if Walt adds 240 kilograms
to the bin

18:50.463 --> 18:52.296
and gets it moving
at 12 miles per hour.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.865
(grunts) Thank you, Ralph.

18:53.867 --> 18:55.299
That's very helpful.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.534
It was a simple calculation.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.703
You could've done it yourself.

18:58.704 --> 19:00.871
Well, Cabe and I needed to focus
on gathering debris.

19:00.874 --> 19:02.607
Kid's pissed at you, huh?

19:02.609 --> 19:04.142
(sighs) Yeah.
For a brilliant child,

19:04.144 --> 19:06.677
he is unreasonable.
Is he?

19:06.679 --> 19:08.446
WALTER: Well, I've explained
my position to him

19:08.448 --> 19:10.214
and he's being
wholly oppositional.

19:10.216 --> 19:12.550
Thing about kids,

19:12.552 --> 19:14.552
they can be very forgiving,

19:14.554 --> 19:16.721
but only if they hear the truth.

19:16.723 --> 19:17.788
TOBY:
First of all,

19:17.790 --> 19:18.890
the kid can hear you.

19:18.892 --> 19:20.525
Second,
the only truth that matters

19:20.527 --> 19:22.426
is that I'm estimating
you are less than two minutes

19:22.428 --> 19:24.929
from Happy's charge
being released into the ground,

19:24.931 --> 19:26.497
and you still don't have
a negative plate ready.

19:26.499 --> 19:28.866
Doc's right.
We're at 90 seconds.

19:28.868 --> 19:32.803
One, two, three.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.172
(grunts)

19:42.315 --> 19:44.916
(coughs)

19:44.918 --> 19:46.250
Up there. Up there.

19:46.252 --> 19:47.385
That looks wide enough.

19:54.694 --> 19:56.928
Guys, charge blows
in 50 seconds.

19:56.930 --> 19:58.529
Almost there.

19:58.531 --> 19:59.964
TOBY:
You're right, Cabe,

19:59.966 --> 20:02.366
because the GPS says
the plate goes ten feet ahead.

20:02.368 --> 20:03.401
(grunts)

20:09.275 --> 20:10.808
Okay, it's grounded.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.310
Let's go.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.344
We're smoking like
crazy up here.

20:13.346 --> 20:14.812
Charge is gonna blow any second.

20:16.583 --> 20:17.882
(grunts)

20:22.789 --> 20:24.388
(whoops) Did it work?

20:31.297 --> 20:32.797
It's glass. It worked.

20:32.799 --> 20:33.931
Damn right it worked!

20:33.933 --> 20:35.767
I'm looking at thermal imaging,

20:35.768 --> 20:37.602
and the fire has stopped
just short of the sand pit.

20:37.604 --> 20:38.836
It's like it hit
an invisible wall.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.371
(Ray whoops)

20:40.373 --> 20:41.606
We did it! Go, team!

20:41.608 --> 20:44.342
Oh, we did it.

20:44.344 --> 20:47.945
Okay,
according to my calculations,

20:47.947 --> 20:49.513
being cut off
from its fuel source,

20:49.515 --> 20:51.349
the fire should burn out
within the day,

20:51.351 --> 20:54.318
and we still have a 54% chance
of making the wedding.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.486
WALTER: You might want to take
another crack

20:55.488 --> 20:56.587
at that percentage.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.856
The explosion
caused another collapse.

20:58.858 --> 21:01.859
I'm separated
from Cabe and the exit.

21:01.861 --> 21:03.728
I don't think
I'm making the wedding

21:03.730 --> 21:05.363
any time soon.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.676
Okay, the chief just called
the station house.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.611
They're gonna bring down men
with micro-drills

21:20.613 --> 21:22.613
to break away the rocks
holding you down.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.849
No, that'll take hours.
You'll miss your flight.

21:24.851 --> 21:26.284
We could leave him there

21:26.285 --> 21:27.718
and just send him pictures
from the reception.

21:27.719 --> 21:29.152
WALTER:
I would be happy to sacrifice

21:29.153 --> 21:30.586
my seat at the head table so you
could make it to the wedding.

21:30.590 --> 21:31.722
He's not at the head table.

21:31.724 --> 21:33.424
I'm getting a little dizzy,

21:33.426 --> 21:35.626
and can only assume
that carbon monoxide

21:35.628 --> 21:38.462
from the fire burning out
above me is making its way

21:38.464 --> 21:40.364
through cracks
in the shaft's ceiling.

21:40.366 --> 21:41.866
Carbon monoxide will kill Walter

21:41.868 --> 21:44.001
once it reaches critical mass
of his air supply!

21:44.003 --> 21:46.337
We have minutes
to get him out of there!

21:46.339 --> 21:48.572
Cabe, just smash the bin
into the wall again!

21:48.574 --> 21:52.343
I can't! The bin's been damaged
by debris!

21:52.345 --> 21:53.744
There's oxygen
tanks on the truck.

21:53.746 --> 21:56.314
No, I'm looking
at one-inch cracks in the rocks.

21:56.316 --> 21:57.648
The tanks won't fit
through there.

21:57.650 --> 21:59.517
HAPPY:
Walt, give us a minute.
We're gonna

21:59.519 --> 22:00.918
dig through everything
in this truck

22:00.920 --> 22:02.753
and find something
to get you out of there.

22:02.755 --> 22:05.756
All right, kid.
You just hold tight!

22:07.727 --> 22:11.395
Hey, Cabe...
take your comms out?

22:11.397 --> 22:14.532
Okay. My comm's out.

22:14.534 --> 22:17.068
I'm a few hundred feet
under earth,

22:17.070 --> 22:19.804
and-and my leg is firmly pinned.

22:19.806 --> 22:22.373
The odds of getting out are low.

22:22.375 --> 22:23.941
So...

22:23.943 --> 22:25.943
I need you
to tell Paige something.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.678
Tell her I'm sorry.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.081
That I was wrong.

22:30.083 --> 22:31.782
You listen to me, son.

22:31.784 --> 22:34.685
One-- you're gonna
get out of here!

22:34.687 --> 22:35.920
And two--

22:35.922 --> 22:38.689
if you've got something
you need to tell Paige,

22:38.691 --> 22:41.625
you need to man up
and tell her yourself!

22:51.404 --> 22:53.104
Happy, where are we
on a solution?

22:53.106 --> 22:54.438
I think we've got something.

22:54.440 --> 22:56.707
The chief's firehouse
covers the airport,

22:56.709 --> 22:58.976
which means it carries a tank
of high-expansion concentrate

22:58.978 --> 23:00.711
for jet-fuel fires.

23:00.713 --> 23:02.380
SYLVESTER:
We're going to remove
the nozzle from the hose.

23:02.382 --> 23:04.115
Cabe slides it in through
the cracks in the rocks.

23:04.117 --> 23:06.517
You need to tie a knot
at the bottom of the hose

23:06.519 --> 23:08.886
and put it underneath the rocks
that are pinning you down.

23:08.888 --> 23:10.054
TOBY:
You pump
that expanding concentrate

23:10.056 --> 23:11.789
into a hose that is tied off,

23:11.791 --> 23:13.124
and the pressure
will be so great,

23:13.126 --> 23:14.525
it'll lift the rocks off Walter!

23:14.527 --> 23:16.594
And then... and then,
Walter just gets up,

23:16.596 --> 23:18.696
runs as fast as he can
in-into the wall,

23:18.698 --> 23:20.731
bam, knocks down the rocks.

23:20.733 --> 23:24.001
RALPH:
Or the fire truck drives off,
pulling the knotted hose

23:24.003 --> 23:25.503
behind it,
tearing down the wall.

23:25.505 --> 23:27.671
That's another way to do it.

23:27.673 --> 23:29.473
(panting)

23:29.475 --> 23:31.542
HAPPY:
Here!

23:31.544 --> 23:33.144
Slide it through to him.

23:33.146 --> 23:36.013
(groaning)

23:36.015 --> 23:38.649
(grunting)

23:40.186 --> 23:42.753
(panting)

23:42.755 --> 23:45.122
(loud groaning)

23:46.025 --> 23:47.057
I got it!

23:47.059 --> 23:48.426
(panting)

23:49.562 --> 23:50.694
(groans)

23:53.666 --> 23:56.700
(panting)

23:56.702 --> 23:59.069
It's tied and in place.

23:59.071 --> 24:00.938
Hit it, Chief!

24:00.940 --> 24:02.673
(water whooshing through hose)

24:04.911 --> 24:06.777
WALTER:
It's working.

24:06.779 --> 24:09.079
It's working.

24:09.081 --> 24:11.015
What's that, son?
I can barely hear you!

24:11.017 --> 24:13.918
(groaning)

24:13.920 --> 24:18.456
Walter?<i> Walter?!</i>

24:18.458 --> 24:20.024
Sly, he's not responding!

24:20.026 --> 24:21.992
Get that fire truck moving now!

24:21.994 --> 24:23.727
We don't know
if the rock's off his leg yet.

24:23.729 --> 24:25.629
Tear down this damn wall!

24:25.631 --> 24:27.565
Go! Go!

24:27.567 --> 24:28.833
(engine revs)

24:31.637 --> 24:36.106
(clanking and loud rumbling)

24:40.713 --> 24:42.213
(coughing):
He's unconscious.

24:42.215 --> 24:44.215
Get him into unpolluted air now!

24:44.217 --> 24:46.384
Come on.

24:46.385 --> 24:48.552
Come on. What's taking so long?
Why aren't they answering?

24:48.554 --> 24:49.220
Where are they?

24:49.222 --> 24:51.088
Wait. Happy!

24:51.090 --> 24:52.623
(coughing)

24:52.625 --> 24:54.725
Are you okay? Walter?

24:54.727 --> 24:56.894
Oh.

24:58.965 --> 25:00.664
They're coming out now!
They're okay!

25:00.666 --> 25:04.034
(loud coughing)

25:05.838 --> 25:07.605
(groaning)
Thanks.

25:07.607 --> 25:09.840
No. Thank you.
Thank<i> all</i> of you.

25:09.842 --> 25:13.110
You almost died saving a tiny
speck of a county in Wyoming.

25:13.112 --> 25:14.612
TOBY:
Speaking of specks,

25:14.614 --> 25:15.880
is there a speck of a chance

25:15.882 --> 25:17.114
you could get
to the airport in time

25:17.116 --> 25:18.566
so I can get married today?

25:18.567 --> 25:20.017
I got you guys
on a connecting flight to Boise,

25:20.019 --> 25:22.103
but it takes off in 20 minutes.

25:22.104 --> 25:24.188
What do you say, Chief? How fast
can you get your rig to go?

25:28.661 --> 25:31.562
Fire trucks are fast,
but not fast enough.

25:31.564 --> 25:33.631
That plane was
our last shot.

25:33.633 --> 25:35.266
I'm sorry,
Happy.

25:35.268 --> 25:38.235
Hey, Paige, just book us
a flight to Los Angeles.

25:38.237 --> 25:40.304
There will be no wedding today.

25:45.011 --> 25:47.144
HAPPY:
<i> Okay, well, thanks</i>
<i> for the download.</i>

25:47.146 --> 25:49.179
Toby, the wedding venue manager

25:49.181 --> 25:51.315
said that your friends
and family had

25:51.317 --> 25:54.218
a wonderful time,
said the DJ was great.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.654
Sounds like we missed
a hell of a wedding.

25:56.656 --> 25:59.290
It's okay, guys. We'll help you
plan another one right away.

25:59.292 --> 26:01.309
That is not gonna happen.

26:01.310 --> 26:03.327
Spent what little savings we had
on this one, and there's no way

26:03.329 --> 26:06.130
I'm getting my cheap relatives
to fly out to Cali again.

26:06.132 --> 26:07.498
WALTER:
There's no way

26:07.499 --> 26:08.865
we could have known
this would have happened.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.835
Of course this happened.

26:10.836 --> 26:12.803
This is what's been happening
to me since I was two.

26:12.805 --> 26:14.872
Don't even know why I bother.

26:17.043 --> 26:19.843
What's this?

26:19.845 --> 26:21.679
Diethyl ether?
RALPH:
Wait!

26:21.681 --> 26:23.147
Don't touch that.
It's for Happy.

26:23.149 --> 26:24.815
It's not ready yet.

26:27.153 --> 26:28.819
PAIGE:
Toby!

26:28.821 --> 26:30.754
What are you doing?!

26:30.756 --> 26:32.323
Wallowing in our misery.

26:32.325 --> 26:34.758
No. I mean, you can't see
the bride on the wedding day!

26:34.760 --> 26:36.226
It's actually not
our wedding day

26:36.228 --> 26:37.795
if you haven't noticed, Paige.

26:37.797 --> 26:39.730
Like hell it isn't!
I'm the best ma'am,

26:39.732 --> 26:41.332
and I take my job seriously.
Now, either

26:41.334 --> 26:43.901
you two tie the knot in a
kick-ass, impromptu ceremony

26:43.903 --> 26:45.135
that I put together
while you were all

26:45.137 --> 26:46.370
flying back, or
you can sit here

26:46.372 --> 26:47.771
and miss
another great party.

26:47.773 --> 26:49.807
Are you serious?
Ralph, bag him.

26:50.977 --> 26:52.242
What the...?

26:52.244 --> 26:53.310
You can't see the bride!

26:53.312 --> 26:54.962
My dress is in San Jose.

26:54.963 --> 26:56.613
I picked out something
beautiful. Can't afford it.

26:56.616 --> 26:58.048
You'll wear it once,
then return it.

26:58.050 --> 26:59.650
What about Toby's family?

26:59.652 --> 27:01.385
Oh, I'm not really
that close with them.

27:01.387 --> 27:03.320
And I just wanted
to show Happy off.

27:03.322 --> 27:05.222
Truth is, you guys
are my family.

27:05.224 --> 27:06.991
I like this attitude.

27:06.993 --> 27:09.126
Okay, hold on.
We don't have a venue,

27:09.128 --> 27:10.928
so, how the hell
is this going down?

27:10.930 --> 27:12.863
You know how you said
you didn't want

27:12.865 --> 27:14.698
to get married
in Kovelsky's parking lot?

27:18.137 --> 27:20.638
No... way.

27:25.745 --> 27:27.811
PAIGE:
Hey, Ralph, come on.

27:31.217 --> 27:33.217
Nice job, Waitress.

27:33.219 --> 27:36.286
Kovelsky's parking lot
has never looks so good.

27:36.288 --> 27:39.323
"Congratulations
Bar Mitzvah Boy"?

27:39.325 --> 27:41.325
Yeah, well, you try
finding a wedding cake

27:41.327 --> 27:42.826
with two hours' notice.

27:45.698 --> 27:48.165
Okay, here they are.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.768
Okay, Cabe
and Walter,

27:50.770 --> 27:52.102
get Toby ready,
and I'll handle Happy.

27:52.104 --> 27:54.004
This way.
Okay.

27:54.006 --> 27:56.840
Oh, no, no.
Turn around.

27:56.842 --> 27:59.143
Are you okay in there?

27:59.145 --> 28:01.311
HAPPY:
Almost ready. I really
appreciate all this.

28:01.313 --> 28:03.881
Why'd you do it?

28:05.451 --> 28:08.218
Well, uh, I know
I disappeared on you guys

28:08.220 --> 28:10.921
when Walter let me go.

28:10.923 --> 28:14.825
The truth is, like Toby said,
we're family.

28:14.827 --> 28:18.062
It's hard for me to
be away from you all,

28:18.064 --> 28:20.297
so I thought it would be easier
to cut ties.

28:20.299 --> 28:22.366
I was wrong.

28:24.103 --> 28:27.171
This is...
how I'm saying I'm sorry.

28:28.207 --> 28:30.874
(sighs)

28:30.876 --> 28:33.010
Okay, I'm done.

28:34.013 --> 28:36.380
Oh, my God.

28:36.382 --> 28:38.816
You look beautiful.

28:38.818 --> 28:41.018
Black boots.

28:44.757 --> 28:46.390
Got to be me.

28:47.359 --> 28:49.893
WALTER:
Looking sharp.

28:49.895 --> 28:51.361
What happened
to the Gosling tux?

28:51.363 --> 28:53.497
I lost too much weight.
It's too big.

28:53.499 --> 28:55.833
But I wore this to my prom.

28:55.835 --> 28:58.736
Went stag, but I looked great.

29:00.272 --> 29:01.905
Are you ready
to do this?

29:01.907 --> 29:04.808
I've been ready
since I met her, boss.

29:04.810 --> 29:07.177
...and lastly,
Cabe's brooch.

29:07.179 --> 29:09.880
Something old to go
on your new dress.

29:09.882 --> 29:12.282
Yeah, well, I fried
Walt's tie clip.

29:12.284 --> 29:14.418
I don't have something borrowed.

29:14.420 --> 29:17.354
All right,
Doc's almost set.

29:19.225 --> 29:21.225
Holy smokes.

29:21.227 --> 29:23.527
Thanks. (laughs)

29:23.529 --> 29:25.529
Um...

29:25.531 --> 29:27.531
Cabe, I need something borrowed.

29:27.533 --> 29:29.533
Can I borrow you?

29:29.535 --> 29:32.402
Um... for what?

29:32.404 --> 29:34.438
Walk me down the aisle.

29:36.408 --> 29:39.943
Sweetheart... it's my honor.

29:39.945 --> 29:42.279
Happy, here.

29:42.281 --> 29:45.249
A blue rose. I made it from
diethyl ether and ammonia.

Thank you, Cabe.

31:24.884 --> 31:26.984
Thank you for coming.
We are gathered here

31:26.986 --> 31:30.120

31:30.122 --> 31:33.023

Toby.

31:33.025 --> 31:34.925
Right. Toby. So sorry.

31:34.927 --> 31:36.426
I just love his films.

31:36.428 --> 31:37.961
Wedding ceremony. Now.

31:37.963 --> 31:40.030
You know what?
Let's just get to the vows.

31:40.032 --> 31:42.900
Then I think I say a few things,
there's some paperwork. Toby,

I love you.

32:13.599 --> 32:17.601
For once you're tongue-tied.

32:17.603 --> 32:19.970
So I guess I'll go.

32:20.706 --> 32:23.307
I'm a mechanical genius,

32:23.309 --> 32:27.444
which means I understand,

32:27.446 --> 32:31.448
in my mind and my heart,

32:31.450 --> 32:33.984
how parts work together.

32:33.986 --> 32:36.053
It's why I love machines.

32:36.055 --> 32:39.456
A bolt and a wrench,
a chain and a gear...

32:39.458 --> 32:41.959

Until I met you.

32:50.336 --> 32:54.004
And I knew then, just like

32:54.006 --> 32:55.739
I know how to assemble engines,

32:55.741 --> 32:57.140
that you and me, Toby...

32:58.544 --> 33:00.577

37:08.794 --> 37:10.493
hallucinogenic seed dust

37:10.495 --> 37:12.629
and I'm not facing
imminent death.

37:12.631 --> 37:15.632
I'm just stating
an irrefutable fact.

37:17.469 --> 37:20.403
I fired you...

37:20.405 --> 37:22.706
because I'm in love with you.

37:24.710 --> 37:26.509
I've been in love with you

37:26.511 --> 37:29.546
since shortly after we met.

37:29.548 --> 37:34.017
And I've spent years
trying to process

37:34.019 --> 37:35.685
how that should be handled.

37:35.687 --> 37:37.887
Perhaps it's not something

37:37.889 --> 37:39.956
that is supposed to be handled.

37:39.958 --> 37:42.792
Maybe it-it's something
that just is.

37:44.896 --> 37:48.665
And I-I know you-you don't
feel the same as I do.

37:48.667 --> 37:50.834
And that's okay.

37:50.836 --> 37:53.536
But I-I just wanted you to know.

37:53.538 --> 37:57.507
Walter.

37:57.509 --> 38:00.577
I'm in love with you, too.

38:04.616 --> 38:07.617
I don't know what to do
with that information.

38:07.619 --> 38:10.787
I have an idea.

38:10.789 --> 38:12.389
Ooh, nice.

38:13.558 --> 38:14.624
Well done, Ray.

38:15.727 --> 38:17.627
I can't tell you
how good this feels

38:17.629 --> 38:20.930
after not seeing you
all day, Mrs. Curtis.

38:20.932 --> 38:22.832
That was your choice.

38:22.834 --> 38:24.301
Mr. Quinn.

38:24.303 --> 38:26.970
Regardless, we haven't
had five seconds alone.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.674
Want to go sneak
off for a minute?

38:30.676 --> 38:33.543
Normally, I'd call you a perv,

38:33.545 --> 38:35.912
but now that would make
me Mrs. Perv.

38:37.416 --> 38:38.982
Plus, you don't look
half bad tonight.

38:46.458 --> 38:47.557
Uh, here.

38:47.559 --> 38:48.758
Utility closet?
I don't care.

38:51.096 --> 38:53.029
Guess Paige is
back on the team.
Close the door.

38:53.031 --> 38:54.764
Guys, Cabe wanted
to talk to-- (gasps)

38:54.766 --> 38:56.566
By the Scepter of Ravenswood!

38:56.568 --> 38:57.901
Close the door!

38:57.903 --> 38:59.336
CABE:
Sylvester, what's
taking so long?

39:01.340 --> 39:02.906
Well, it's about damn time.

39:02.908 --> 39:04.808
Anyone else want to come by?
How about Ray?

39:04.810 --> 39:08.111
What's up, guys?

39:08.113 --> 39:10.580
CABE:
Well, I know this
is not a good time,

39:10.582 --> 39:12.782
but we have a case.

39:12.784 --> 39:14.017
We're in the middle
of our wedding.

39:14.019 --> 39:15.852
Yeah, but you're gonna
like this one.

39:15.854 --> 39:17.120
The government
of French Polynesia

39:17.122 --> 39:18.488
needs help setting up their

39:18.490 --> 39:20.724
underwater wave-powered
generators.

39:20.726 --> 39:23.626
They're willing to fly us
and pay top dollar

39:23.628 --> 39:25.061
to Tahiti, meaning...

39:25.063 --> 39:26.463
Free honeymoon.

39:26.465 --> 39:28.498
With everyone else,
that kind of ruins it.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.666
No, no. I-I-I
can't leave Ralph.

39:29.668 --> 39:30.767
I didn't line up a sitter.

39:30.769 --> 39:32.419
Oh. W-We can take him.

39:32.420 --> 39:34.070
Normally, I would love to go,
seriously.

39:34.072 --> 39:36.873
But, eh, I lost my passport
at the dog track.

39:36.875 --> 39:38.007
And Pam,

39:38.009 --> 39:39.876
you can have your old job back.

39:41.913 --> 39:44.481
My word is done here.

39:44.483 --> 39:46.549
(ball bounces)

39:48.954 --> 39:50.587
Well, everybody
else pack your bags,

39:50.589 --> 39:52.873
because they're loading
up the equipment

39:52.874 --> 39:55.158
you're gonna be working with
on their plane as we speak.

39:55.160 --> 39:56.760
Wheels up in 60.

40:11.476 --> 40:13.710
So, flight's delayed.

40:13.712 --> 40:14.744
Seriously?

40:14.746 --> 40:15.779
PILOT:
Our copilot is sick

40:15.781 --> 40:17.781
and the backup lives

40:17.783 --> 40:19.849
north of San Luis Obispo.

40:19.851 --> 40:21.785
So we're looking at a
minimum of four hours, okay?

40:21.787 --> 40:22.919
HAPPY:
Nope.

40:22.921 --> 40:24.454
Not waiting one more minute.

40:24.456 --> 40:26.623
We just got married
in a parking lot tonight.

40:26.625 --> 40:27.991
Paige, don't get me wrong,
it was perfect.

40:27.993 --> 40:29.993
But it was a parking lot,
so we're gonna have

40:29.995 --> 40:32.128
our fancy honeymoon
we deserve starting now.

40:32.130 --> 40:33.663
Law says you need
a copilot to fly.

40:33.665 --> 40:34.864
HAPPY:
You're looking at her.

40:34.866 --> 40:38.468
Got a multi-engine
commercial license.

40:38.470 --> 40:39.969
Looks good to me.

40:39.971 --> 40:42.939
Are there any other secrets
about you that I should know,

40:42.941 --> 40:44.441
my beautiful bride?

40:44.443 --> 40:46.009
Probably.

40:48.880 --> 40:52.081
Oh, shotgun Toby.
(laughs)

40:52.083 --> 40:53.483
Hey, Doc.

40:53.485 --> 40:56.219
I got you a wedding present.

40:59.024 --> 41:01.224
Two rolls of pennies?

41:01.226 --> 41:02.759
You shouldn't have.

41:02.761 --> 41:04.894
Shut up.
It's a Scottish tradition.

41:04.896 --> 41:06.896
Townsfolk used
to collect pennies

41:06.898 --> 41:08.998
to pay for weddings
in the old country.

41:09.000 --> 41:12.936
And this...
is an Italian tradition.

41:12.938 --> 41:15.772
It's called a boost.

41:15.774 --> 41:17.774
There's a nice check in there
to help you two on your way.

41:17.776 --> 41:20.009
Well, thank you.
That means a lot.

41:20.011 --> 41:21.911
You're welcome, Doc.

41:21.913 --> 41:23.179
HAPPY (over intercom):
All right, everyone.

41:23.181 --> 41:24.981
Thank you for choosing
Genius Air.

41:24.983 --> 41:27.917
Our flight time today
is eight hours, 25 minutes,

41:27.919 --> 41:31.187
and 36.63 seconds,
so get cozy.

41:31.189 --> 41:32.989
French Polynesia, here we come.

41:41.032 --> 41:43.666
So how does this work now?

41:43.668 --> 41:46.870
I don't think there's really
a standard operating procedure.

41:46.872 --> 41:49.672
I think we just
play it by ear a little.

41:51.109 --> 41:52.542
We have to tell Ralph.

41:52.544 --> 41:53.810
At the right time.

41:53.812 --> 41:55.778
Whatever you think's best.

41:55.780 --> 41:58.147
I have a really good feeling
about this, Walter.

41:59.284 --> 42:01.184
(loud thud)

42:02.821 --> 42:04.787
Mom? What's going on?

42:04.789 --> 42:06.789
Just some turbulence.

42:06.791 --> 42:08.291
(thuds and rattling)

42:08.293 --> 42:11.261
Something's wrong, I can tell.

42:11.263 --> 42:12.695
Oh, would you relax?

42:12.697 --> 42:14.297
I'm sure Happy's got everything
under control.

42:16.234 --> 42:18.568
Does she, Toby? Does she?

42:18.570 --> 42:20.036
I'm gonna go check
what's going on.

42:20.038 --> 42:23.239
Everyone else,
stay in your seats.

42:25.977 --> 42:27.710
We've lost power.

42:27.712 --> 42:29.279
Buckle up and brace yourselves,
we're going down.
