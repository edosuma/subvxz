<i>Stardate 9521 .6.</i>

03:37.926 --> 03:40.553
Captain's Log, U.S.S. Excelsior.

03:40.637 --> 03:42.597
<i>Hikaru Sulu commanding.</i>

03:43.515 --> 03:44.640
<i>After three years,</i>

03:44.725 --> 03:48.060
<i>l've concluded my first assignment</i>
<i>as master of this vessel,</i>

03:48.145 --> 03:51.981
<i>cataloguing gaseous planetary</i>
<i>anomaIies in Beta Quadrant.</i>

03:54.109 --> 03:57.194
<i>We're heading home</i>
<i>under full impulse power.</i>

03:57.279 --> 04:00.239
<i>l am pleased to report</i>
<i>that ship and crew have functioned well.</i>

04:00.324 --> 04:04.493
According to this, we've completed
our survey of the entire sector.

04:16.505 --> 04:19.091
l have an energy wave
at 240 degrees mark 6 port, sir.

04:19.176 --> 04:20.343
Visual.

04:22.304 --> 04:24.805
My God.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.227
Shields. Shields!

04:40.906 --> 04:42.365
She's not answering her helm.

04:42.449 --> 04:44.617
Starboard thruster.
Turn her into the wave.

04:44.701 --> 04:45.743
<i>Aye.</i>

04:49.581 --> 04:51.123
Quarter impulse power.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.133
<i>Damage report.</i>

05:01.218 --> 05:02.426
Checking all systems, Captain.

05:09.059 --> 05:10.810
Don't tell me
that was any meteor shower.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.103
Negative, sir.

05:12.187 --> 05:16.941
The subspace shockwave
originated at bearing 3-2-3 mark 75.

05:17.025 --> 05:18.401
Location...

05:19.403 --> 05:21.404
lt's Praxis, sir. lt's a Klingon moon.

05:21.488 --> 05:24.740
Praxis is their key
energy production facility.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.370
Send to Klingon High Command.

05:29.454 --> 05:32.289
"This is Excelsior,
a Federation starship.

05:32.708 --> 05:36.002
"We have monitored
a large explosion in your sector.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.254
"Do you require assistance?"

05:38.672 --> 05:41.173
-Aye, sir.
-Mr Valtane, any more data?

05:41.258 --> 05:43.968
Yes, sir. l've confirmed
the location of Praxis, but...

05:44.052 --> 05:45.261
What is it?

05:46.013 --> 05:48.347
l cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.

05:48.432 --> 05:49.724
Onscreen.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.184
Magnify.

05:52.269 --> 05:53.811
<i>Computer enhancement.</i>

05:56.857 --> 05:59.358
-Praxis?
-What's left of it, sir.

05:59.443 --> 06:01.861
Captain,
l'm getting a message from Praxis.

06:01.945 --> 06:03.446
Let's have it.

06:16.501 --> 06:20.296
<i>This is Brigadier Kerla</i>
<i>speaking for the High Command.</i>

06:20.380 --> 06:23.924
<i>There has been an incident on Praxis.</i>

06:24.009 --> 06:29.472
<i>However, everything is under control.</i>
<i>We have no need for assistance.</i>

06:29.723 --> 06:35.561
<i>Obey treaty stipulations</i>
<i>and remain outside the neutral zone.</i>

06:36.563 --> 06:38.856
<i>This transmission ends now.</i>

06:41.318 --> 06:42.735
"An incident"?

06:42.819 --> 06:45.946
-Do we report this, sir?
-Are you kidding?

06:53.455 --> 06:55.206
What are we doing here?

06:55.290 --> 06:57.249
Maybe they're throwing us
a retirement party.

06:57.334 --> 07:00.419
-That suits me. l just bought a boat.
-This had better be good.

07:00.504 --> 07:03.380
l'm supposed to be chairing a seminar
at the Academy.

07:03.465 --> 07:05.925
Captain, isn't this just for top brass?

07:06.009 --> 07:07.593
lf we're all here, where's Sulu?

07:07.677 --> 07:11.138
Captain Sulu. On assignment.
Where's Spock?

07:19.898 --> 07:24.485
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the CinC.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.201
As you were.

07:35.831 --> 07:38.582
To break this information down
succinctly,

07:38.667 --> 07:42.378
the Klingon Empire
has roughly 50 years of life left to it.

07:43.421 --> 07:46.298
For full details,
l'm turning this briefing over

07:46.383 --> 07:48.759
to the Federation's special envoy.

08:01.356 --> 08:02.815
Good morning.

08:03.233 --> 08:06.652
Two months ago, a Federation starship
monitored an explosion

08:06.736 --> 08:08.821
on the Klingon moon Praxis.

08:09.531 --> 08:11.615
We believe it was caused
by over-mining

08:11.700 --> 08:14.493
and insufficient safety precautions.

08:14.578 --> 08:18.581
The moon's decimation means
the deadly pollution of their ozone.

08:18.665 --> 08:20.791
They will have depleted
their supply of oxygen

08:20.876 --> 08:23.460
in approximately 50 Earth years.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.672
Due to their enormous military budget,

08:26.756 --> 08:28.674
the Klingon economy does not have
the resources

08:28.758 --> 08:31.427
with which to combat this catastrophe.

08:32.636 --> 08:36.347
Last month, at the behest
of the Vulcan ambassador,

08:36.433 --> 08:41.812
l opened a dialogue with Gorkon,
Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.

08:42.688 --> 08:45.983
He proposes to commence negotiations
at once.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.360
Negotiations for what?

08:49.487 --> 08:53.365
The dismantling of our space stations
and starbases along the neutral zone,

08:53.450 --> 08:56.702
an end to almost 70 years
of unremitting hostility,

08:56.786 --> 08:59.830
which the Klingons can no longer afford.

09:00.457 --> 09:04.001
Bill, are we talking
about mothballing the Starfleet?

09:04.586 --> 09:07.463
Well, l'm sure that our exploration
and scientific programmes

09:07.547 --> 09:10.799
-would be unaffected, Captain, but...
-l must protest.

09:10.884 --> 09:15.221
To offer Klingons safe haven
within Federation space is suicide.

09:15.305 --> 09:18.557
Klingons would become
the alien trash of the galaxy,

09:18.642 --> 09:20.267
and if we dismantle the fleet,

09:20.352 --> 09:22.978
we'd be defenceless
before an aggressive species

09:23.063 --> 09:25.064
with a foothold on our territory.

09:25.148 --> 09:28.567
The opportunity here
is to bring them to their knees.

09:29.319 --> 09:33.489
Then we'll be in a far better position
to dictate terms.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.282
Sir?

09:36.243 --> 09:37.701
Captain Kirk.

09:37.827 --> 09:40.537
The Klingons
have never been trustworthy.

09:41.665 --> 09:43.916
l'm forced to agree
with Admiral Cartwright.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.001
This is a terrifying idea.

09:46.294 --> 09:50.339
lt is imperative that we act now
to support the Gorkon initiative

09:50.674 --> 09:53.467
lest more conservative elements
persuade his empire

09:53.551 --> 09:57.638
that it is better to attempt
a military solution and die fighting.

09:57.806 --> 10:01.141
You, Captain Kirk,
are to be our first olive branch.

10:02.811 --> 10:05.229
We have volunteered to rendezvous
with the Klingon vessel

10:05.313 --> 10:07.606
which is bringing Chancellor Gorkon
to Earth

10:07.691 --> 10:11.068
and to escort him safely
through Federation space.

10:11.152 --> 10:12.152
Me?

10:12.237 --> 10:15.489
Well, there are Klingons who feel
the same way about the peace treaty

10:15.573 --> 10:18.075
as yourself and Admiral Cartwright,

10:19.035 --> 10:22.746
but they'll think twice about attacking
the Enterprise under your command.

10:22.831 --> 10:26.500
l have personally vouched for you
in this matter, Captain.

10:26.710 --> 10:30.045
You have personally vouched?

10:30.839 --> 10:35.759
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon
full diplomatic courtesy, Captain Kirk.

10:35.844 --> 10:37.720
But a full ambassador
would be better equipped...

10:37.846 --> 10:40.055
lf there's no further business,

10:40.640 --> 10:44.601
l wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

10:44.686 --> 10:47.396
l remind you, this meeting is classified.

10:53.903 --> 10:57.239
l don't know whether
to congratulate you or not, Jim.

10:58.533 --> 10:59.908
l wouldn't.

11:03.955 --> 11:05.497
We volunteered?

11:06.333 --> 11:11.462
There is an old Vulcan proverb,
"Only Nixon could go to China."

11:12.339 --> 11:14.381
How could you vouch for me?

11:15.258 --> 11:17.926
That's arrogant presumption.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.179
My father requested
that l open negotiations...

11:20.263 --> 11:23.140
l know your father's the Vulcan
ambassador, for heaven's sake,

11:23.224 --> 11:25.684
but you know how l feel about this.

11:27.354 --> 11:28.395
They're animals.

11:28.480 --> 11:32.775
Jim, there is an historic opportunity
here.

11:32.942 --> 11:35.527
Don't believe them. Don't trust them.

11:36.029 --> 11:38.614
-They are dying.
-Let them die.

11:41.785 --> 11:47.206
Has it occurred to you that this crew
is due to stand down in three months?

11:47.457 --> 11:50.209
We've done our bit for king and country.

11:50.877 --> 11:52.920
You should have trusted me.

11:58.885 --> 12:02.888
<i>Control, this is SD-103,</i>
<i>approach to spacedock. Over.</i>

12:02.972 --> 12:06.558
SD-1 03, you are clear
<i>to deliver Captain Kirk and party</i>

12:06.643 --> 12:10.312
to NCC-1 701 Alpha. Over.

12:15.693 --> 12:17.027
Captain on the Bridge.

12:17.112 --> 12:20.197
-As you were, Lieutenant...
-Valeris, sir.

12:20.740 --> 12:23.409
We were told that you needed
a helmsman, so l volunteered.

12:23.493 --> 12:26.662
Lieutenant, it is agreeable
to see you again.

12:27.455 --> 12:29.748
Lieutenant was the first Vulcan
to be graduated

12:29.833 --> 12:33.669
-at the top of her class at the academy.
-You must be very proud.

12:33.753 --> 12:35.254
l don't believe so, sir.

12:35.338 --> 12:37.381
She's a Vulcan, all right.

12:37.465 --> 12:40.342
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.

12:41.302 --> 12:42.594
-Scotty.
<i>-Aye, sir?</i>

12:42.679 --> 12:43.929
Did you find the engine room?

12:44.013 --> 12:45.431
<i>Right where l left it, sir.</i>

12:45.515 --> 12:48.475
Standby. Uhura, get me the dockmaster.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.769
Control tower reading, sir.

12:50.854 --> 12:55.232
Control, this is Enterprise
requesting permission to depart.

12:55.483 --> 12:58.861
This is Control, Enterprise.
<i>Permission to depart granted.</i>

12:58.945 --> 13:00.529
<i>Thirty seconds for port gates.</i>

13:00.613 --> 13:02.239
Clear all moorings.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.867
Awaiting port gates from this mark.

13:05.201 --> 13:06.368
<i>All moorings clear.</i>

13:06.453 --> 13:08.120
Aft thrusters.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.914
Thank you, Lieutenant.
One-quarter impulse power.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.960
Captain, may l remind you
that regulations specify thrusters

13:15.044 --> 13:17.045
only while in spacedock?

13:21.384 --> 13:22.676
Jim?

13:25.221 --> 13:27.556
You heard the order, Lieutenant.

13:28.433 --> 13:29.725
Aye, sir.

14:03.092 --> 14:06.512
<i>Captain's Log, Stardate 9522.6.</i>

14:07.263 --> 14:10.933
l've never trusted Klingons,
and l never will.

14:15.730 --> 14:18.899
l could never forgive them
for the death of my boy.

14:20.944 --> 14:23.987
lt seems to me our mission
to escort the Chancellor

14:24.072 --> 14:27.616
of the Klingon High Council
to a peace summit

14:28.451 --> 14:30.452
is problematic at best.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.625
Spock says this could be
an historic occasion,

14:36.709 --> 14:38.835
and l'd like to believe him,

14:39.212 --> 14:43.131
but how on earth can history
get past people like me?

14:45.927 --> 14:47.094
Sorry.

14:48.179 --> 14:49.388
You could have knocked.

14:49.472 --> 14:53.433
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
l thought that you would like to know.

14:53.518 --> 14:54.685
Right.

14:59.148 --> 15:03.193
Permission to speak freely, sir.
lt is an honour to serve with you.

15:09.450 --> 15:12.494
You piloted well
out of spacedock, Lieutenant.

15:13.162 --> 15:15.289
l've always wanted to try that, sir.

15:25.675 --> 15:27.676
You've done well, Valeris.

15:28.011 --> 15:31.597
As your sponsor at the academy,

15:31.681 --> 15:34.474
l have followed your career
with satisfaction,

15:34.559 --> 15:38.854
and as a Vulcan,
you've exceeded my expectations.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.358
l do not understand this representation.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.404
lt is a depiction
from ancient Earth mythology,

15:48.197 --> 15:50.324
the expulsion from Paradise.

15:50.867 --> 15:52.993
Why keep it in your quarters?

15:54.120 --> 15:56.955
lt is a reminder to me
that all things end.

16:01.753 --> 16:05.005
lt is of endings that l wish to speak.

16:07.717 --> 16:10.844
Sir, l address you as a kindred intellect.

16:12.221 --> 16:14.014
Do you not recognise

16:15.224 --> 16:19.394
that a turning point has been reached
in the affairs of the Federation?

16:21.230 --> 16:25.067
History is replete
with turning points, Lieutenant.

16:25.276 --> 16:28.236
-You must have faith.
-Faith?

16:28.738 --> 16:31.573
That the universe
will unfold as it should.

16:32.241 --> 16:36.578
-But is that logical? Surely we must...
-Logic, logic and logic.

16:38.373 --> 16:42.584
Logic is the beginning
of wisdom, Valeris,

16:42.960 --> 16:44.378
not the end.

16:46.798 --> 16:51.218
This will be my final voyage onboard
this vessel as a member of her crew.

16:54.263 --> 16:56.848
Nature abhors a vacuum.

16:58.601 --> 17:00.686
l intend you to replace me.

17:09.779 --> 17:11.946
l could only succeed you, sir.

17:17.203 --> 17:20.038
<i>Now hear this. All officers to the Bridge.</i>

17:20.123 --> 17:22.374
<i>Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.</i>

17:22.458 --> 17:24.334
<i>All officers to the Bridge.</i>

17:41.060 --> 17:42.853
Captain on the Bridge.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.661
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?

18:01.247 --> 18:03.123
Never been this close.

18:05.501 --> 18:08.837
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting
our signal.

18:17.972 --> 18:20.849
-Uhura, hailing frequencies.
-Aye, sir.

18:21.350 --> 18:23.769
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.605
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.

18:26.856 --> 18:28.857
Channel is open, Captain.

18:29.859 --> 18:31.568
This is the Starship Enterprise,

18:31.694 --> 18:34.029
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.865
This is Kronos One.

18:38.159 --> 18:40.035
<i>I am Chancellor Gorkon.</i>

18:44.707 --> 18:46.958
Chancellor, we've been ordered
to escort you

18:47.043 --> 18:50.128
through Federation space
to your meeting on Earth.

18:50.213 --> 18:51.922
<i>Thank you, Captain.</i>

18:52.465 --> 18:55.300
Would you and your party
care to dine this evening

18:55.384 --> 18:57.636
aboard the Enterprise with my officers,

18:57.720 --> 19:00.722
as guests
of the United Federation of Planets?

19:01.057 --> 19:04.726
<i>We would be delighted to accept</i>
<i>your gracious invitation.</i>

19:08.022 --> 19:11.817
We'll make arrangements to have you
beamed aboard at 1 930 hours.

19:11.901 --> 19:14.110
<i>I shall look forward to that.</i>

19:21.410 --> 19:23.912
-Well, l hope you're happy.
-Captain,

19:24.997 --> 19:27.415
there is a supply
of Romulan ale aboard.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.544
lt might make the evening
pass more smoothly.

19:31.337 --> 19:33.463
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.

19:36.092 --> 19:38.218
Guess who's coming to dinner.

19:49.856 --> 19:51.106
Energise.

20:25.433 --> 20:27.642
-Chancellor Gorkon.
-Captain Kirk.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.896
May l present Captain Spock,
whom l believe you know.

20:30.980 --> 20:33.481
Captain, face to face at last.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.152
-You have my thanks.
-Chancellor.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.323
Gentlemen,

20:42.325 --> 20:44.743
this is my daughter Azetbur,

20:48.497 --> 20:51.499
my military adviser, Brigadier Kerla,

20:53.628 --> 20:57.213
and this is General Chang,
my chief of staff.

20:58.049 --> 21:01.051
l have so wanted to meet you, Captain.

21:02.345 --> 21:04.512
l'm not sure how to take that.

21:05.056 --> 21:07.974
Sincere admiration, Kirk.

21:08.225 --> 21:11.061
From one warrior to another.

21:12.980 --> 21:14.147
Right.

21:17.276 --> 21:20.987
This way.
l think you might enjoy a brief tour.

21:38.798 --> 21:41.549
-They all look alike.
-What about that smell?

21:41.634 --> 21:45.011
You know only top-of-the-line models
can even talk...

21:50.476 --> 21:51.643
You men have work?

21:51.727 --> 21:53.228
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

21:53.312 --> 21:54.896
Then snap to it.

22:35.104 --> 22:36.771
l offer a toast.

22:37.732 --> 22:39.774
"The undiscover'd country,"

22:43.404 --> 22:44.654
the future.

22:44.739 --> 22:46.698
-"The undiscover'd country."
-"The undiscover'd country."

22:46.782 --> 22:49.242
Hamlet, Act lll, Scene 1 .

22:49.326 --> 22:50.994
You've not experienced Shakespeare

22:51.078 --> 22:53.705
until you have read him
in the original Klingon.

23:04.383 --> 23:08.344
Captain Kirk,
l thought Romulan ale was illegal.

23:08.637 --> 23:10.847
One of the advantages
of being 1 ,000 light-years

23:10.931 --> 23:12.849
from Federation Headquarters.

23:13.392 --> 23:17.479
To you, Chancellor Gorkon,
one of the architects of our future.

23:17.730 --> 23:19.355
-Chancellor.
-Chancellor.

23:21.650 --> 23:25.236
Perhaps we are looking
at something of that future here.

23:27.990 --> 23:29.741
Tell me, Captain Kirk,

23:30.951 --> 23:34.329
would you be willing
to give up Starfleet?

23:39.210 --> 23:43.588
l believe the Captain feels
that Starfleet's mission

23:43.672 --> 23:45.882
has always been one of peace.

23:48.886 --> 23:50.970
Far be it for me
to dispute my first officer,

23:51.055 --> 23:52.722
but Starfleet has always been
at the fore...

23:52.807 --> 23:54.974
Captain, there's no need
to mince words.

23:55.059 --> 23:58.144
ln space, all warriors are cold warriors.

24:00.523 --> 24:03.108
General, are you fond of

24:03.692 --> 24:05.360
Shakespeare?

24:06.487 --> 24:09.614
We do believe all planets
have a sovereign claim

24:09.698 --> 24:11.449
to inalienable human rights.

24:11.534 --> 24:15.537
lnalien?
lf you could only hear yourselves.

24:16.872 --> 24:18.331
"Human rights."

24:19.083 --> 24:21.209
Why, the very name is racist.

24:22.461 --> 24:26.381
The Federation is no more
than a "Homo Sapiens Only" club.

24:26.882 --> 24:29.384
Present company excepted, of course.

24:29.510 --> 24:32.762
ln any case,
we know where this is leading.

24:33.222 --> 24:36.474
-The annihilation of our culture.
-That's not true.

24:36.559 --> 24:37.851
-No?
-No.

24:38.853 --> 24:40.687
"To be, or not to be."

24:40.771 --> 24:44.732
That is the question which preoccupies
our people, Captain Kirk.

24:44.817 --> 24:48.319
-We need breathing room.
-Earth, Hitler, 1 938.

24:50.239 --> 24:51.906
l beg your pardon?

24:56.078 --> 24:57.287
Well...

25:00.499 --> 25:03.084
l see we have a long way to go.

25:04.044 --> 25:06.254
We must do this again sometime.

25:10.843 --> 25:13.261
You don't trust me, do you?

25:14.597 --> 25:16.264
l don't blame you.

25:17.808 --> 25:20.685
lf there is to be a brave new world,

25:20.769 --> 25:24.772
our generation is going
to have the hardest time living in it.

25:29.570 --> 25:30.820
Captain Spock.

25:31.322 --> 25:32.697
Chancellor.

25:33.282 --> 25:35.742
-Madam.
-Captain.

25:36.285 --> 25:38.119
Well, most kind.

25:39.163 --> 25:43.833
"Parting is such sweet sorrow," Captain.

25:45.461 --> 25:48.880
Have we not
"heard the chimes at midnight"?

26:13.030 --> 26:14.364
Thank God.

26:15.991 --> 26:18.117
Did you see the way they ate?

26:19.036 --> 26:21.079
Terrible table manners.

26:21.789 --> 26:23.581
l doubt that our own behaviour

26:23.666 --> 26:26.167
will distinguish us
in the annals of diplomacy.

26:26.252 --> 26:27.961
l'm going to sleep this off.

26:28.045 --> 26:30.964
Please let me know if there's some
other way we can screw up tonight.

26:31.048 --> 26:33.883
l'm going to go find
a pot of black coffee.

26:49.525 --> 26:53.111
The Enterprise hosted
Chancellor Gorkon and company

26:53.195 --> 26:55.029
to dinner last night.

26:56.198 --> 26:59.867
Our manners weren't exactly
Emily Post.

27:01.078 --> 27:02.120
Note to the galley,

27:02.204 --> 27:05.873
Romulan ale no longer to be served
at diplomatic functions.

27:09.044 --> 27:12.338
<i>Captain Kirk, will you please</i>
<i>join me on the Bridge?</i>

27:12.798 --> 27:14.173
<i>Captain Kirk?</i>

27:20.597 --> 27:22.557
-Captain.
-What is it?

27:22.641 --> 27:24.392
l find this curious.

27:24.518 --> 27:25.643
Spock, l'm really tired.

27:25.728 --> 27:29.188
We are reading an enormous amount
of neutron radiation.

27:30.733 --> 27:31.774
Where?

27:31.859 --> 27:35.069
Strangely enough,
it appears to be emanating from us.

27:35.154 --> 27:36.696
<i>The Enterprise?</i>

27:39.116 --> 27:42.452
Valeris, do you know anything
about a radiation surge?

27:42.953 --> 27:44.037
Sir?

27:44.246 --> 27:45.204
Chekov?

27:45.289 --> 27:47.915
Only the size of my head.

27:48.334 --> 27:50.001
l know what you mean.

28:05.225 --> 28:08.770
-What's happened?
-We have fired on the Chancellor's ship.

28:08.854 --> 28:10.855
Torpedo Room, please confirm.

28:10.939 --> 28:12.315
Have we fired?

28:12.399 --> 28:13.608
...0-6...

28:13.692 --> 28:15.943
-Uhura, monitor.
-Aye, sir.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.403
Direct hit.

28:18.364 --> 28:19.906
Confirmed, sir.

28:31.293 --> 28:33.044
We've lost gravity!

28:47.559 --> 28:49.268
We are betrayed!

28:49.978 --> 28:52.772
<i>This is the Bridge. Do you read?</i>
<i>Do you read?</i>

28:52.856 --> 28:54.899
Torpedo bay,
did we fire those torpedoes?

28:54.983 --> 28:57.360
Negative, Captain.
According to inventory,

28:57.444 --> 28:59.070
we're still fully loaded.

29:17.714 --> 29:20.425
Find Chang.

29:27.391 --> 29:30.268
Unable to confirm or deny
firing of two photon torpedoes.

29:30.352 --> 29:32.645
-Hailing frequencies.
-Aye, sir.

29:33.522 --> 29:37.775
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
<i>Do you read? Over.</i>

29:38.777 --> 29:40.695
Repeat. Kronos One...

30:43.800 --> 30:45.885
lt's very hard to make out, Captain.

30:45.969 --> 30:49.430
There's been some weapons firing
and a lot of shouting.

30:49.515 --> 30:50.848
She is still listing.

30:50.933 --> 30:53.184
She's spinning out of control.

31:12.454 --> 31:16.207
Restoring auxiliary gravity.

31:26.969 --> 31:30.221
<i>Have you not a shred</i>
<i>of decency in you, Kirk?</i>

31:31.306 --> 31:35.184
<i>We come in peace,</i>
<i>and you blatantly defile that peace.</i>

31:36.562 --> 31:39.480
<i>For that,</i>
<i>l shall blow you out of the stars.</i>

31:42.276 --> 31:44.819
-We haven't fired.
-Captain.

31:46.321 --> 31:49.699
According to our databanks,
we have, twice.

31:50.117 --> 31:52.326
Captain, they're coming about.

31:59.001 --> 32:02.086
-They're preparing to fire.
-Shields up, Captain?

32:02.170 --> 32:05.464
-Captain, our shields.
-Shields up, Captain?

32:07.593 --> 32:10.177
-Signal our surrender.
-Captain?

32:10.262 --> 32:11.721
We surrender!

32:13.098 --> 32:15.308
-This is Enterprise. We surrender.
-lf they fire at us

32:15.392 --> 32:16.851
-with our shields down...
-l repeat.

32:16.935 --> 32:19.103
-We surrender.
-...we will not be able to respond.

32:19.187 --> 32:21.397
Repeat. Enterprise surrenders.

32:25.527 --> 32:27.403
-Are we firing torpedoes?
-l wish l knew.

32:28.113 --> 32:29.864
Well, it sure looks like it.

32:29.948 --> 32:31.616
l'm going aboard.
Spock, you have the conn.

32:31.700 --> 32:34.118
l am responsible
for involving you in this. l will go.

32:34.202 --> 32:36.621
No, l'll go. You'll be responsible
for getting me out of this.

32:36.705 --> 32:38.789
We'll not be the instigators
of full-scale war

32:38.874 --> 32:40.583
on the eve of universal peace.

32:40.667 --> 32:42.501
l'm going, too. They may need a doctor.

32:42.586 --> 32:44.837
-Perhaps you're right.
-Uhura, tell them we're coming,

32:44.921 --> 32:46.631
and tell them we're unarmed.

32:46.715 --> 32:47.965
Aye, sir.

32:53.388 --> 32:55.097
Have you lost your mind?

32:55.182 --> 32:56.932
l give you my word,
l don't understand what has happened.

32:57.017 --> 32:58.684
We're here to help.

33:00.562 --> 33:01.937
Follow me.

33:27.255 --> 33:30.424
-Chancellor Gorkon.
-My God.

33:30.967 --> 33:34.679
-What has happened here?
-You dare to feign ignorance?

33:34.763 --> 33:37.848
-What happened?
-With a direct torpedo hit,

33:37.933 --> 33:40.643
you crippled
our entire gravitational field,

33:40.727 --> 33:44.814
and two of your Starfleet crew
beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots

33:44.898 --> 33:45.898
and did this.

33:45.982 --> 33:47.566
Aren't you carrying a surgeon?

33:47.651 --> 33:49.360
We were until this disgrace.

33:49.444 --> 33:52.279
Well, then for God sakes, man,
let me help.

34:03.291 --> 34:05.334
l've got a pulse. We can move him.

34:05.419 --> 34:08.838
l'm gonna need some light.
Can we get him up on this table?

34:17.179 --> 34:20.349
Hold him. Hold him while l stabilise him.

34:27.399 --> 34:28.815
l said hold him.

34:33.321 --> 34:34.612
Sweet Jesus.

34:35.282 --> 34:38.324
-Can you...
-Jim, l don't even know his anatomy.

34:42.706 --> 34:45.833
-His wounds are not closing.
-He's killing him!

34:50.922 --> 34:53.924
He's gone into
some kind of damned arrest.

34:58.180 --> 35:01.307
Come on, damn it! Come on!

35:05.562 --> 35:07.354
He's not responding.

35:26.625 --> 35:30.127
Don't let it end this way, Captain.

36:06.456 --> 36:11.126
Under article number 1 84
of your interstellar law,

36:12.712 --> 36:15.130
l'm placing you under arrest.

36:15.215 --> 36:20.845
You are charged with assassinating
our Chancellor of the High Council.

36:20.929 --> 36:22.721
He tried to save him.

36:29.646 --> 36:31.564
They've been arrested.

36:32.983 --> 36:35.609
Mr Spock, we've got to do something.

36:37.112 --> 36:40.447
l assume command of this ship
as of 0230 hours.

36:40.532 --> 36:43.534
Commander Uhura,
please notify Starfleet Headquarters.

36:43.618 --> 36:45.035
Tell them precisely
what has taken place

36:45.120 --> 36:46.829
-and request instructions.
-Aye, sir.

36:46.913 --> 36:49.498
We cannot allow them to be taken back
to Kronos as prisoners.

36:49.583 --> 36:53.168
What do you suggest, Lieutenant?
Opening fire will not retrieve them,

36:53.253 --> 36:56.338
and an armed conflict is precisely
what the Captain wished to avoid.

36:56.423 --> 36:58.591
We will be able to follow
the Captain's movements.

36:58.675 --> 37:02.136
-How did you achieve this, sir?
-Time is precious, Lieutenant.

37:02.220 --> 37:05.723
We must endeavour to piece together
what happened here tonight.

37:05.807 --> 37:09.435
According to our databank,
this ship fired those torpedoes.

37:09.519 --> 37:10.728
No way.

37:10.812 --> 37:14.356
l sympathise, Mr Scott,
but we need evidence.

37:14.441 --> 37:16.191
Please accompany me.

37:17.652 --> 37:20.654
And if we cannot
piece together what happened?

37:21.114 --> 37:23.866
-What then, sir?
-ln that case, Mr Chekov,

37:23.950 --> 37:27.161
it resides in the purview
of the diplomats.

37:28.496 --> 37:31.832
The Chancellor of the High Council
is dead!

37:32.792 --> 37:37.504
The result of an unprovoked attack
while he travelled to see you

37:37.589 --> 37:40.758
under a flag of truce,
on a mission of peace.

37:42.010 --> 37:44.595
Captain Kirk was legally arrested
for the crime.

37:45.472 --> 37:47.598
May l remind you that he and Dr McCoy

37:47.682 --> 37:50.726
boarded Kronos One
of their own free will?

37:50.810 --> 37:53.562
None of these facts are in dispute,
Mr President.

37:53.647 --> 37:56.440
l have ordered a full-scale investigation.

37:56.983 --> 37:59.276
-ln the meantime...
-ln the meantime,

37:59.361 --> 38:03.614
we expect the Federation to abide
by the articles of interstellar law,

38:03.698 --> 38:05.699
which you claim to cherish.

38:06.159 --> 38:08.786
Kirk and Dr McCoy will stand trial

38:08.870 --> 38:11.121
for the assassination
of Chancellor Gorkon.

38:11.206 --> 38:12.957
Out of the question.

38:13.083 --> 38:14.541
Ambassador Sarek,
there must be some way

38:14.626 --> 38:16.418
to extradite these men.

38:16.503 --> 38:21.632
Mr President, l share a measure
of personal responsibility in this matter,

38:21.716 --> 38:23.592
but l am obliged to confirm

38:23.677 --> 38:26.428
my esteemed colleague's
legal interpretation.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.514
What is the position
of the Romulan government,

38:28.598 --> 38:30.140
Ambassador Nanclus?

38:31.309 --> 38:33.769
l must concur with my colleagues.

38:33.853 --> 38:37.022
But you can't possibly believe
that James Kirk assassinated

38:37.107 --> 38:39.608
the Chancellor of the High Council.

38:39.693 --> 38:43.278
Mr President,
l don't know what to believe.

38:44.823 --> 38:47.241
l'm waiting for your answer, sir.

38:49.411 --> 38:52.621
This president is not above the law.

38:53.748 --> 38:56.542
<i>Report back at once. Do you copy?</i>
<i>At once.</i>

38:57.127 --> 38:59.003
Enterprise to report back on the double.

38:59.087 --> 39:00.504
<i>Do you read? At once.</i>

39:00.588 --> 39:02.256
We're to report back at once.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.758
We cannot abandon
Captain Kirk and Dr McCoy.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.343
Of course not.

39:06.428 --> 39:08.846
Four hundred years ago
on the planet Earth,

39:08.930 --> 39:12.057
workers who felt their livelihood
threatened by automation

39:12.142 --> 39:17.521
flung their wooden shoes called "sabot"
into the machines to stop them.

39:19.858 --> 39:23.193
Hence the word "sabotage."

39:26.072 --> 39:28.615
We are experiencing
technical malfunction.

39:28.700 --> 39:31.076
All backup systems inoperative.

39:31.411 --> 39:34.788
Excellent. l mean, too bad.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.708
<i>Mr President,</i>

39:37.792 --> 39:40.044
<i>I've been named Chancellor</i>
<i>by the High Council</i>

39:40.128 --> 39:41.920
<i>in my father's place.</i>

39:42.464 --> 39:43.672
Madam Chancellor,

39:43.757 --> 39:46.717
you have my sincerest condolences
on your recent loss.

39:46.801 --> 39:49.470
l want to assure you
that this shameful deed will not...

39:49.554 --> 39:52.639
<i>Mr President, let us come to the point.</i>

39:53.266 --> 39:56.518
<i>You want this conference</i>
<i>to go forward, and so did my father.</i>

39:56.603 --> 40:00.189
<i>I will attend in one week</i>
<i>on one condition.</i>

40:00.273 --> 40:02.566
<i>We will not extradite the prisoners,</i>

40:02.650 --> 40:06.904
<i>and you will make no attempt</i>
<i>to rescue them in a military operation.</i>

40:06.988 --> 40:10.741
<i>We would consider any such attempt</i>
<i>an act of war.</i>

40:11.242 --> 40:13.077
We hope you'll be our guest
here on Earth.

40:13.161 --> 40:18.207
<i>After recent events, you will understand</i>
<i>if l say l prefer a neutral site,</i>

40:18.833 --> 40:23.670
<i>and in the interests of security,</i>
<i>let us keep the location secret for now.</i>

40:24.506 --> 40:26.673
<i>As you wish, Madam Chancellor.</i>

40:28.802 --> 40:31.762
Attack them now, while we still can!

40:32.597 --> 40:35.933
Attack or be slaves in their world.

40:39.562 --> 40:43.148
We can take whole by force,
what they propose to divide.

40:45.527 --> 40:51.824
War is obsolete, General,
as we are in danger of becoming.

40:54.577 --> 40:59.540
Better to die on our feet
than live on our knees.

41:00.250 --> 41:03.293
That wasn't what my father wanted.

41:03.711 --> 41:06.421
Your father was killed
for what he wanted.

41:07.966 --> 41:10.759
The peace process will go forward.

41:12.887 --> 41:14.096
Kirk...

41:18.059 --> 41:22.062
Kirk will pay for my father's death.

41:25.567 --> 41:27.442
<i>-Kirk! Kirk!</i>
<i>-Kirk! Kirk!</i>

41:28.653 --> 41:50.299
-Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!
-Kirk! Kirk! Kirk! Kirk!

41:54.929 --> 41:56.680
lt's a damn show trial.

41:56.764 --> 41:59.433
-Kirk! Kirk!
-Kirk! Kirk!

42:07.650 --> 42:12.029
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One
without provocation.

42:12.739 --> 42:14.740
The Chancellor and his advisers...

42:14.824 --> 42:17.743
...having been lulled
into a false sense of security

42:17.827 --> 42:21.371
by an invitation to a state dinner
aboard Captain Kirk's vessel

42:21.456 --> 42:25.459
at precisely 1 930 hours
that same evening.

42:26.127 --> 42:28.128
Call your first witness.

42:28.671 --> 42:32.049
After the first shot,
we lost our gravitational field.

42:32.133 --> 42:34.801
l found myself weightless
and unable to function.

42:34.886 --> 42:37.971
<i>Then two StarfIeet crewmen</i>
<i>came walking towards me.</i>

42:38.056 --> 42:40.515
<i>But perhaps they merely wore</i>
<i>StarfIeet uniforms.</i>

42:40.600 --> 42:43.894
<i>That remark is purely speculative.</i>
<i>I move that it be stricken.</i>

42:43.978 --> 42:48.148
<i>CoIoneI Worf,</i>
<i>we are interested in facts, not theories.</i>

42:48.650 --> 42:52.069
lf the gravitational unit
was not functioning,

42:52.153 --> 42:54.071
how could these men be walking?

42:54.155 --> 42:56.490
They appeared to be wearing
magnetic boots.

42:59.035 --> 43:00.535
Gravity boots.

43:01.996 --> 43:06.833
Dr McCoy,
would you be so good as to tell me,

43:07.919 --> 43:10.504
what is your current medical status?

43:12.048 --> 43:15.425
Aside from a touch of arthritis,
l'd say pretty good.

43:22.600 --> 43:25.018
You have a singular wit, Doctor.

43:25.812 --> 43:29.690
For 27 years, l've been ship surgeon
aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.

43:30.149 --> 43:32.359
ln three months, l stand down.

43:35.446 --> 43:39.199
You know, l believe that you consumed

43:39.284 --> 43:43.453
a rather generous amount
of Romulan ale in the officers' mess

43:43.538 --> 43:45.247
on the night in question.
Am l right, Doctor?

43:45.331 --> 43:47.457
-Objection!
-Sustained.

43:47.542 --> 43:50.335
We all did. All of us.

43:50.545 --> 43:55.299
-That doesn't mean...
-Was Chancellor Gorkon alive

43:55.383 --> 43:57.301
when you first examined him?

43:57.385 --> 44:00.137
-Barely.
-Now be careful, Doctor.

44:00.221 --> 44:07.060
Have you ever, in your past,
saved patients as barely alive as he?

44:07.145 --> 44:10.564
l didn't have the medical knowledge
l needed for Klingon anatomy.

44:10.648 --> 44:12.941
-l see.
-You were there.

44:13.943 --> 44:16.445
You say you are due for retirement.

44:17.655 --> 44:19.364
May l ask, do your hands shake?

44:19.449 --> 44:21.491
-Objection!
-l was nervous.

44:23.578 --> 44:24.578
No.

44:25.621 --> 44:27.414
You were incompetent.

44:29.584 --> 44:31.376
You were incompetent!

44:31.836 --> 44:35.756
Whether deliberately or as a result
of age combined with drink,

44:36.299 --> 44:41.261
-the court will have to determine.
-My God, man! l tried to save him!

44:42.263 --> 44:44.014
l tried to save him.

44:46.267 --> 44:48.352
l was desperate to save him.

44:50.104 --> 44:53.774
He was the last best hope
in the universe for peace.

44:54.650 --> 44:56.651
The witness is excused.

45:00.990 --> 45:03.116
There we have it, citizens.

45:03.201 --> 45:06.703
We have finally established
the particulars of the crime,

45:06.788 --> 45:11.458
and now we come to the architect
of this tragic affair,

45:12.043 --> 45:16.963
James Tiberius Kirk.

45:19.133 --> 45:22.094
What would
your favourite author say, Captain?

45:22.804 --> 45:23.970
"Let us sit upon the ground

45:24.055 --> 45:26.973
"and tell sad stories
of the death of kings."

45:27.725 --> 45:30.143
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.

45:30.978 --> 45:35.107
Tell us that you planned to take revenge
for the death of your son.

45:36.275 --> 45:38.402
-That's not true.
-Objection!

45:38.486 --> 45:41.446
Captain Kirk has not been identified
as the assassin.

45:41.531 --> 45:43.156
Sustained.

45:43.533 --> 45:45.450
l offer into the record

45:46.160 --> 45:49.413
this excerpt
from the Captain's personal log.

45:50.540 --> 45:54.418
<i>l've never trusted Klingons,</i>
<i>and I never will.</i>

45:55.962 --> 45:59.589
<i>l have never been able to forgive them</i>
<i>for the death of my boy.</i>

46:03.469 --> 46:05.720
Again. Again!

46:06.013 --> 46:09.349
<i>l've never trusted Klingons,</i>
<i>and I never will.</i>

46:10.017 --> 46:13.937
<i>l have never been able to forgive them</i>
<i>for the death of my boy.</i>

46:17.442 --> 46:19.234
Are those your words?

46:22.613 --> 46:24.865
Those words were spoken by me.

46:29.120 --> 46:30.287
Objection!

46:30.371 --> 46:33.123
My client's political views
are not on trial here.

46:33.207 --> 46:36.209
On the contrary!
Captain Kirk's views and motives

46:36.294 --> 46:39.129
are indeed
at the very heart of the matter.

46:39.380 --> 46:42.299
This officer's record
shows him to be an insubordinate,

46:42.383 --> 46:45.677
unprincipled,
career-minded opportunist,

46:45.761 --> 46:47.929
with a history of violating
the chain of command

46:48.014 --> 46:49.473
whenever it suited him!

46:49.557 --> 46:50.974
Continue.

46:51.058 --> 46:53.643
lndeed, the record shows
that Captain Kirk

46:53.728 --> 46:55.437
once held the rank ofAdmiral,

46:55.521 --> 46:58.857
and that Admiral Kirk was broken
for taking matters into his own hands

46:58.941 --> 47:00.567
in defiance of regulations of the law.

47:00.651 --> 47:02.444
Do you deny being demoted
for these charges?

47:02.528 --> 47:05.447
Don't wait for the translation!
Answer me now!

47:05.531 --> 47:06.656
l cannot deny it.

47:06.741 --> 47:08.325
-You were demoted?
-Yes.

47:08.409 --> 47:12.746
-For insubordination?
-On occasion, l have disobeyed orders.

47:12.830 --> 47:15.874
And were you obeying
or disobeying orders

47:15.958 --> 47:19.044
when you arranged the assassination
of Chancellor Gorkon?

47:19.128 --> 47:21.838
l didn't know about the assassination
until we boarded the ship.

47:21.923 --> 47:24.799
You still deny the Enterprise
fired on Kronos One?

47:24.884 --> 47:26.843
-Well...
-Your Honours, please!

47:26.928 --> 47:30.055
And you still deny your men beamed
aboard and shot the Chancellor?

47:30.139 --> 47:31.264
Objection!

47:31.349 --> 47:33.934
l cannot confirm or deny actions
l did not witness.

47:34.018 --> 47:35.477
Captain Kirk,

47:36.187 --> 47:39.481
are you aware
that as the captain of a starship,

47:39.565 --> 47:43.735
you are required to be responsible
for the actions of your men?

47:46.364 --> 47:47.656
l am.

47:47.740 --> 47:50.992
And if it should be proved
that members of your crew

47:51.077 --> 47:54.246
did, in fact,
carry out such an assassination...

47:54.330 --> 47:56.498
Jim, they're setting us up.
Your Honours...

47:56.582 --> 47:57.582
Do not answer!

47:57.667 --> 48:00.961
Captain Kirk,
you will answer the question.

48:09.303 --> 48:10.428
As captain,

48:12.723 --> 48:16.101
l am responsible for the conduct
of the crew under my command.

48:19.772 --> 48:21.940
Your Honours, the State rests.

48:24.485 --> 48:26.361
Send to Commander Enterprise.

48:27.947 --> 48:31.950
"We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior. "

48:32.785 --> 48:39.207
lt is the determination of this court
that the prisoners are guilty as charged.

48:51.178 --> 48:52.762
l wish to note for the record

48:52.847 --> 48:56.600
that the evidence against my clients
is entirely circumstantial.

48:56.684 --> 49:00.729
l beg the court to consider this
when pronouncing its sentence.

49:00.813 --> 49:02.439
So noted.

49:02.523 --> 49:06.735
Captain James T. Kirk,
Dr Leonard McCoy,

49:06.819 --> 49:13.116
in the interest of fostering amity
for the forthcoming peace talks,

49:13.868 --> 49:17.370
the sentence of death is commuted.

49:24.337 --> 49:28.131
lt is the judgement of this court

49:29.383 --> 49:33.637
that, without possibility of reprieve
or parole,

49:33.721 --> 49:36.640
you be taken from this place

49:36.724 --> 49:43.521
to the dilithium mines
on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe,

49:44.231 --> 49:48.985
there to spend
the rest of your natural lives.

49:56.952 --> 49:58.703
Rura Penthe?

50:01.415 --> 50:04.959
Known throughout the galaxy
as the aliens' graveyard.

50:05.920 --> 50:08.755
Better to kill them now
and get it over with.

50:30.069 --> 50:34.280
Lieutenant, the torpedo hit
once again, please.

50:39.745 --> 50:40.829
Hold.

50:42.456 --> 50:44.332
lt is Enterprise.

50:45.251 --> 50:48.336
-We fired.
-That is not possible.

50:48.713 --> 50:52.006
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.

50:53.551 --> 50:57.137
An ancestor of mine maintained
that if you eliminate the impossible,

50:57.221 --> 51:01.182
whatever remains, however improbable,
must be the truth.

51:01.559 --> 51:03.810
What exactly does that mean?

51:03.894 --> 51:07.522
lt means that if we cannot
have fired those torpedoes,

51:07.606 --> 51:09.149
someone else did.

51:09.233 --> 51:13.361
Well, they did not fire on themselves,
and there were no other ships present.

51:13.446 --> 51:16.072
There was
an enormous neutron energy surge.

51:16.157 --> 51:17.198
Not from us!

51:17.283 --> 51:21.703
A neutron surge that big
could only be produced by another ship.

51:22.496 --> 51:24.038
<i>Kronos One?</i>

51:24.123 --> 51:25.874
Too far away.

51:25.958 --> 51:29.961
Very near us. Possibly beneath us.

51:30.546 --> 51:34.549
lf there were a ship beneath us,
the Klingons would have seen her.

51:37.094 --> 51:38.470
Would they?

51:41.682 --> 51:45.185
-A bird-of-prey.
-A bird-of-prey.

51:48.147 --> 51:49.230
Cloaked?

51:49.315 --> 51:52.358
A bird-of-prey cannot fire
when she's cloaked.

51:52.443 --> 51:56.112
All things being equal, Mr Scott,
l would agree.

51:56.197 --> 51:58.490
However, things are not equal.

51:59.158 --> 52:00.617
This one can.

52:01.202 --> 52:02.660
We must inform Starfleet Command.

52:02.745 --> 52:06.748
lnform them of what,
a new weapon that is invisible?

52:06.832 --> 52:09.125
Raving lunatics,
that's what they'll call us.

52:09.210 --> 52:12.420
They'll say that we're so desperate
to exonerate the Captain

52:12.505 --> 52:14.088
that we'll say anything.

52:14.173 --> 52:17.425
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence,

52:17.510 --> 52:20.553
only a theory
which happens to fit the facts.

52:20.846 --> 52:23.223
Assuming you're right, Mr Spock,

52:23.766 --> 52:25.892
why would they fire
on their own president?

52:25.976 --> 52:27.185
lndeed.

52:28.062 --> 52:29.854
This ship will be searched
from bow to stern.

52:29.939 --> 52:31.481
Lieutenant Valeris, you'll be in charge.

52:31.565 --> 52:33.942
-Aye, sir.
-l do not understand.

52:34.026 --> 52:36.736
lf there was a ship underneath us,

52:36.821 --> 52:39.656
surely the assassins
beamed aboard from that vessel,

52:39.740 --> 52:41.157
<i>not Enterprise.</i>

52:41.242 --> 52:43.952
You're forgetting something,
Mr Chekov.

52:44.703 --> 52:48.414
According to our databanks,
this ship fired those torpedoes.

52:48.916 --> 52:51.167
lf we did, the killers are here.

52:51.252 --> 52:55.713
lf we did not,
whoever altered the databanks is here.

52:55.965 --> 52:59.884
ln either case,
what we are looking for is here.

53:01.095 --> 53:03.304
What are we looking for, sir?

53:04.390 --> 53:05.765
Lieutenant?

53:06.976 --> 53:09.102
Two pairs of gravity boots.

54:15.127 --> 54:18.379
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.

54:19.089 --> 54:23.092
There is no stockade, no guard tower,

54:23.844 --> 54:26.137
no electronic frontier.

54:27.139 --> 54:30.391
Only a magnetic shield
prevents beaming.

54:31.060 --> 54:36.314
Punishment means exile
from prison to the surface.

54:37.066 --> 54:41.027
On the surface, nothing can survive.

54:45.658 --> 54:49.202
Work well and you will be treated well.

54:50.329 --> 54:53.790
Work badly and you will die.

56:20.919 --> 56:22.295
Oh, my God.

56:27.551 --> 56:30.970
The universal translator's
been confiscated.

56:32.806 --> 56:34.140
l'm sorry?

56:38.979 --> 56:41.773
He's definitely on about something, Jim.

56:46.820 --> 56:49.322
lf this is your spot, we'll move on.

56:49.990 --> 56:52.992
He wants your obedience
to the brotherhood of aliens.

56:53.077 --> 56:55.369
-He's got it.
-And your coat.

56:55.454 --> 56:58.164
l'm afraid not. Besides, it wouldn't fit.

57:13.013 --> 57:14.180
Thanks.

57:14.681 --> 57:16.891
This will help keep you warm.

57:18.685 --> 57:21.729
l'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy, l presume.

57:23.732 --> 57:24.857
How'd you know that?

57:24.942 --> 57:27.360
We don't get many
presidential assassins.

57:27.444 --> 57:30.071
-We didn't kill Gorkon.
-Of course not,

57:31.323 --> 57:34.784
-but there is a reward for your death.
-lt figures.

57:35.410 --> 57:37.453
We've been set up all along.

57:37.538 --> 57:40.373
Somebody up there
wants you out of the way.

57:46.171 --> 57:47.880
-Nothing in here.
-Nothing here.

57:48.173 --> 57:49.632
-Any progress?
-None.

57:49.716 --> 57:52.844
We have a crew of 300
turning their own quarters inside out,

57:52.928 --> 57:55.304
but the killers may still be among them.

57:55.389 --> 57:58.474
Surely they have disposed
of these boots by now.

57:59.017 --> 58:01.978
Would it not have been logical
to have left them on Gorkon's ship?

58:02.062 --> 58:04.480
Even logic must give way to physics.

58:04.565 --> 58:07.150
Gravity had not been restored
by the time they escaped.

58:07.526 --> 58:08.484
Without the boots,

58:08.569 --> 58:11.904
they would have floated off
the Klingon transporter pads.

58:12.406 --> 58:14.532
Why not simply vapourize them?

58:17.578 --> 58:18.953
Like this?

58:25.919 --> 58:27.211
At ease.

58:27.462 --> 58:30.965
As you know, Commander Chekov,
no one can fire an unauthorised phaser

58:31.049 --> 58:32.717
aboard a starship.

58:33.844 --> 58:37.847
Suppose when they returned,
they threw the boots into the refuse.

58:38.223 --> 58:42.310
l'm having the refuse searched.
lf my surmise is correct,

58:42.394 --> 58:44.353
those boots will cling
to the killers' necks

58:44.438 --> 58:46.606
like a pair of Tiberian bats.

58:46.982 --> 58:48.691
They could not
make their escape without them,

58:48.775 --> 58:51.903
nor can they simply throw them
out the window for all to see.

58:51.987 --> 58:56.324
-Those boots are here somewhere.
-Did someone fire off a phaser?

58:56.658 --> 58:59.493
lt's all right. lt's nothing. lt's nothing.

59:00.787 --> 59:04.457
Mr Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us
to return to port.

59:05.250 --> 59:08.211
-Who fired that...
-Mr Scott.

59:08.795 --> 59:11.214
l understand you're having difficulty
with the warp drive.

59:11.298 --> 59:13.216
How much time
do you require for repair?

59:13.300 --> 59:15.051
There's nothing wrong
with the bloody thing.

59:15.135 --> 59:17.803
Mr Scott, if we return to spacedock,

59:18.472 --> 59:20.181
the assassins will surely find a way

59:20.265 --> 59:22.516
to dispose
of their incriminating footwear,

59:22.976 --> 59:26.687
and we will never see
the Captain or Dr McCoy alive again.

59:27.272 --> 59:30.107
-lt could take weeks, sir.
-Thank you, Mr Scott.

59:30.192 --> 59:32.401
Valeris, please inform
Starfleet Command

59:32.486 --> 59:35.154
-our warp drive is inoperative.
-A lie?

59:35.697 --> 59:36.989
An error.

59:37.658 --> 59:42.078
You understand we have lost all contact
with the Captain and Dr McCoy.

59:42.162 --> 59:45.331
Yes. At the moment, they're surrounded
by a magnetic shield.

59:45.415 --> 59:49.085
However, if l know the Captain,
by this time,

59:49.169 --> 59:51.671
he is deep into planning his escape.

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:18.072
You got him, Jim!
You got him where you want him!

01:01:10.542 --> 01:01:12.626
-You all right, Jim?
-l think so.

01:01:12.753 --> 01:01:15.129
-They'll respect you now.
-That's a comfort.

01:01:15.213 --> 01:01:18.841
-l was lucky that thing had knees.
-That was not his knee.

01:01:19.926 --> 01:01:23.137
Not everybody keeps their genitals
in the same place, Captain.

01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:26.223
Anything you want to tell me?

01:01:27.476 --> 01:01:29.685
Bones, why don't you see
what you can do for him?

01:01:29.770 --> 01:01:32.480
Let him know
we're not holding a grudge.

01:01:32.731 --> 01:01:34.940
Suppose he's holding a grudge?

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:41.447
When whoever it is makes their move,
you won't be here to ask if he's the one.

01:01:46.495 --> 01:01:50.122
-Do you want to get out of here?
-There's gotta be a way.

01:02:11.186 --> 01:02:14.522
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.

01:02:14.606 --> 01:02:18.234
-We're not finished.
-No? Speak for yourself.

01:02:18.944 --> 01:02:22.696
One day, one night, Kobayashi Maru.

01:02:22.781 --> 01:02:26.367
Bones, are you afraid of the future?

01:02:28.412 --> 01:02:33.249
l believe that was the general idea
that l was trying to convey.

01:02:33.333 --> 01:02:35.334
l don't mean this future.

01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:40.548
-What is this, multiple choice?
-Some people are afraid

01:02:42.551 --> 01:02:44.343
of what might happen.

01:02:46.096 --> 01:02:47.680
l was terrified.

01:02:48.390 --> 01:02:50.724
What terrified you, specifically?

01:02:57.107 --> 01:02:58.899
No more neutral zone.

01:03:01.236 --> 01:03:03.529
l was used to hating Klingons.

01:03:07.451 --> 01:03:10.995
lt never even occurred to me
to take Gorkon at his word.

01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:15.791
Spock was right.

01:03:16.042 --> 01:03:20.004
Try not to be too hard on yourself.
We all felt exactly the same.

01:03:20.088 --> 01:03:21.130
No.

01:03:22.507 --> 01:03:24.550
Somebody felt a lot worse.

01:03:26.303 --> 01:03:28.596
l'm beginning to understand why.

01:03:29.181 --> 01:03:32.600
Well, if you've got any bright ideas,
now's the time.

01:03:32.726 --> 01:03:35.895
Time's the problem.
You and l are nothing.

01:03:37.439 --> 01:03:39.982
But you heard the judge.
The peace conference is on again.

01:03:40.066 --> 01:03:44.195
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound
to attempt another assassination.

01:03:46.781 --> 01:03:49.033
Unless we can get out of here.

01:04:00.212 --> 01:04:02.004
Kirk, it's me, Martia.

01:04:02.130 --> 01:04:05.424
Listen, no one has ever escaped
from Rura Penthe.

01:04:06.092 --> 01:04:08.511
-Except us.
-lt is possible.

01:04:09.846 --> 01:04:13.432
-l know how to get outside the shield.
-How do we fit in?

01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:15.935
Getting outside the shield is easy,

01:04:16.144 --> 01:04:19.772
but after that, it's up to you to get us
off the surface before we freeze.

01:04:19.856 --> 01:04:21.106
Can you?

01:04:22.275 --> 01:04:25.236
-lt's possible.
-l can't make it alone,

01:04:26.571 --> 01:04:30.699
and you're likeliest candidate
to come in this hellhole for months.

01:04:30.784 --> 01:04:32.535
Candidate for what?

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:50.386
Go to lift seven in the morning
for mining duty.

01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:53.597
l'll see you there. Don't disappoint me.

01:04:56.977 --> 01:05:00.604
-What is it with you, anyway?
-Still think we're finished?

01:05:00.897 --> 01:05:02.439
More than ever.

01:05:07.654 --> 01:05:09.780
-l'm sorry to wake you, sir.
-What is it?

01:05:09.864 --> 01:05:12.074
Starfleet urgently requests
any data we have

01:05:12.158 --> 01:05:14.618
on the whereabouts of Enterprise.

01:05:17.372 --> 01:05:18.497
What?

01:05:18.832 --> 01:05:21.250
Well, apparently, they're refusing
to acknowledge signal

01:05:21.334 --> 01:05:23.502
to return to spacedock, sir.

01:05:27.007 --> 01:05:31.719
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea
location Enterprise.

01:05:32.804 --> 01:05:33.846
Sir?

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:38.183
-You have hearing problems, mister?
-No, sir.

01:06:22.646 --> 01:06:23.646
Klingon blood.

01:06:24.856 --> 01:06:26.857
They must have walked through it
when it was floating

01:06:26.941 --> 01:06:28.942
and tracked it back here.

01:06:30.070 --> 01:06:33.155
This is the first evidence
which corroborates our theory.

01:06:33.239 --> 01:06:34.490
Now we go to Starfleet.

01:06:34.574 --> 01:06:38.202
Now we expand our search
to include uniforms.

01:06:39.412 --> 01:06:40.913
All uniforms?

01:06:47.629 --> 01:06:49.171
Take those out.

01:06:54.844 --> 01:06:57.763
-Continue scanning.
-Nothing, sir.

01:07:00.642 --> 01:07:02.017
Clear, sir.

01:07:03.687 --> 01:07:05.979
Coming through. Coming through.

01:07:07.816 --> 01:07:09.858
Computer well seven clear.

01:07:12.696 --> 01:07:14.196
Nothing. Nothing.

01:07:14.864 --> 01:07:18.617
Okay, let's see what we got.
Nothing. Nothing so far.

01:07:19.077 --> 01:07:20.327
Sir! Sir!

01:07:51.901 --> 01:07:55.112
-l think we've been had.
-No, you weren't, Doctor.

01:07:55.822 --> 01:07:59.491
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.

01:07:59.993 --> 01:08:01.827
They don't take girls.

01:08:12.797 --> 01:08:14.548
You are Crewman Dax?

01:08:15.133 --> 01:08:17.634
Yes, Commander. What is the problem?

01:08:18.636 --> 01:08:22.848
Perhaps you know
Russian epic of Cinderella?

01:08:25.685 --> 01:08:28.729
lf shoe fits, wear it.

01:08:30.648 --> 01:08:32.024
Mr Chekov.

01:08:47.916 --> 01:08:49.207
Watch me.

01:08:52.002 --> 01:08:54.837
What kind of creature is this?
Last night, you two were...

01:08:54.923 --> 01:08:56.548
Don't remind me.

01:08:59.426 --> 01:09:00.636
Get in.

01:10:11.833 --> 01:10:14.459
Come on. We don't have a lot of time.

01:10:32.145 --> 01:10:33.312
Hurry.

01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:38.734
Up there.

01:10:41.321 --> 01:10:42.863
Come on, climb.

01:10:54.292 --> 01:10:56.668
Here. You'll need these. Quickly!

01:11:18.316 --> 01:11:19.691
Stay close.

01:12:36.769 --> 01:12:37.728
There they are.

01:12:37.812 --> 01:12:40.188
They're emerging
from the beaming shield.

01:12:40.273 --> 01:12:42.733
-Mr Scott, start your engines.
-Aye, aye, sir.

01:12:42.817 --> 01:12:45.527
Mr Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.

01:12:45.611 --> 01:12:49.322
Mr Spock, Rura Penthe
is deep inside the Klingon frontier.

01:12:49.782 --> 01:12:52.242
-lf we are discovered...
-Quite correct, Mr Chekov.

01:12:52.326 --> 01:12:55.078
What is required now
is a feat of linguistic legerdemain

01:12:55.580 --> 01:12:57.164
and a degree of intrepidity

01:12:57.248 --> 01:12:59.833
before the Captain and Dr McCoy
freeze to death.

01:13:07.341 --> 01:13:09.551
-Leave me. l'm finished.
-No!

01:13:11.054 --> 01:13:15.098
Bones, l'm wearing a viridium patch
on my back.

01:13:15.475 --> 01:13:19.186
Spock slapped it there
just before we went on Gorkon's ship.

01:13:19.645 --> 01:13:24.775
-Why, that cunning little Vulcan.
-Come on. We're in the clear.

01:13:26.694 --> 01:13:28.403
Now that we're outside the shield,

01:13:28.488 --> 01:13:31.156
they'll be able to locate us
two sectors away.

01:13:31.657 --> 01:13:33.492
lf they're even looking for us.

01:14:03.356 --> 01:14:05.982
This is listening post Morska.

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:09.528
What ship is that? Over.

01:14:21.207 --> 01:14:22.791
We must respond personally.

01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:25.627
A universal translator
would be recognised.

01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:37.514
We am thy freighter Ursva.

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:41.393
Six weeks out of

01:14:42.061 --> 01:14:44.062
Kronos.

01:14:58.870 --> 01:15:00.996
What is your destination? Over.

01:15:05.918 --> 01:15:08.920
We is condemning food,

01:15:12.175 --> 01:15:14.634
things and supplies.

01:15:19.098 --> 01:15:22.267
Don't catch any bugs!

01:15:53.299 --> 01:15:56.551
Would you mind explaining
that little trick you do?

01:15:57.470 --> 01:16:00.347
-l'm a chameloid.
-l've heard about you.

01:16:02.016 --> 01:16:03.558
Shapeshifters.

01:16:05.436 --> 01:16:09.231
-l thought you were mythical.
-Give a girl a chance, Captain.

01:16:11.484 --> 01:16:15.070
-lt takes a lot of effort.
-l don't doubt it.

01:16:16.656 --> 01:16:18.448
Stop me if l'm wrong,

01:16:18.866 --> 01:16:22.786
but do we have any way of knowing
whether this is the real you?

01:16:23.287 --> 01:16:26.081
l thought l would assume
a pleasing shape.

01:16:33.005 --> 01:16:36.424
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.

01:16:37.468 --> 01:16:38.969
lf you say so.

01:16:41.013 --> 01:16:42.514
Are you crazy?

01:16:42.682 --> 01:16:44.182
She didn't need our help
getting anywhere.

01:16:44.267 --> 01:16:46.101
Where'd you get
these convenient clothes?

01:16:46.185 --> 01:16:49.062
Don't tell me that flare
is standard prison issue.

01:16:49.522 --> 01:16:53.525
lt's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.

01:16:53.609 --> 01:16:55.110
A full pardon,

01:16:56.362 --> 01:16:58.154
which doesn't cover this.

01:16:58.239 --> 01:17:01.324
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.

01:17:02.034 --> 01:17:05.453
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.

01:17:06.539 --> 01:17:11.167
Killed while attempting escape.
Now that's convincing for both.

01:17:15.881 --> 01:17:17.132
Surprise!

01:17:29.145 --> 01:17:31.980
-Your friends are late.
-They'll be along.

01:17:35.526 --> 01:17:39.779
-l can't believe l kissed you.
-Must have been your lifelong ambition.

01:17:55.338 --> 01:17:57.672
lsn't it about time
you became something else?

01:17:57.757 --> 01:17:59.299
l like it here.

01:18:08.392 --> 01:18:11.644
Well, well, well.

01:18:19.445 --> 01:18:21.279
What took you so long?

01:18:22.698 --> 01:18:26.451
-Kill him. He's the one.
-Not me, you idiot. Him!

01:18:29.330 --> 01:18:32.624
-No witnesses.
-Killed while trying to escape.

01:18:33.793 --> 01:18:36.753
-Damn clever, if you ask me.
-lt's a classic.

01:18:37.129 --> 01:18:40.423
-That's what he wanted.
-Who? Who wanted us killed?

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:44.969
Since you're all going to die anyway,
why not tell you?

01:18:45.513 --> 01:18:47.013
His name is...

01:18:53.437 --> 01:18:57.607
Damn it to hell! Of all the... Son of a...

01:18:57.942 --> 01:19:00.068
-Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
-Captain?

01:19:00.152 --> 01:19:02.278
He was just about to explain
the whole thing.

01:19:02.363 --> 01:19:03.655
You want to go back?

01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:06.241
-Absolutely not!
-lt's cold.

01:19:07.827 --> 01:19:10.745
<i>This is the Bridge.</i>
<i>We are still in Klingon space.</i>

01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:15.875
<i>Deck 9, remain at battle stations.</i>
<i>Deck 9, remain at battle stations.</i>

01:19:49.535 --> 01:19:51.911
They were beamed aboard
a Federation starship.

01:19:52.163 --> 01:19:54.747
l could trace...

01:20:01.005 --> 01:20:03.089
Escaped.

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:08.970
Kirk cannot know the location
of the peace conference.

01:20:10.264 --> 01:20:11.890
Are you sure?

01:20:12.558 --> 01:20:15.894
Will you take that chance?

01:20:17.771 --> 01:20:20.440
Helmsman, make course
to intercept Enterprise.

01:20:26.864 --> 01:20:28.031
The Klingons have a new weapon,

01:20:28.115 --> 01:20:30.033
a bird-of-prey that can fire
when cloaked.

01:20:30.117 --> 01:20:32.368
-She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
-So that's it.

01:20:32.453 --> 01:20:35.079
Not entirely. l have reason to believe
that Gorkon's murderers

01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:37.916
-are aboard this vessel.
-l have a thought about that.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.375
Has the peace conference begun?

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:41.252
Who knows?
They're keeping the location secret.

01:20:41.337 --> 01:20:43.171
-There's always something.
-Captain!

01:20:43.589 --> 01:20:48.051
Mr Spock! l found the missing uniforms
with the Klingon blood on them.

01:21:03.442 --> 01:21:06.903
But the uniforms belong
to these two men,

01:21:06.987 --> 01:21:09.239
Burke and Samno.

01:21:09.657 --> 01:21:13.243
Not any more.
Phaser on stun at close range.

01:21:13.327 --> 01:21:16.538
First rule of assassination,
kill the assassins.

01:21:17.581 --> 01:21:20.792
-Now we're back to square one.
-Can l talk to you?

01:21:23.546 --> 01:21:26.047
l wonder why they weren't vapourized.

01:21:27.091 --> 01:21:29.175
lt would set off the alarm.

01:21:36.308 --> 01:21:37.809
lt's possible.

01:21:38.519 --> 01:21:43.982
<i>Now hear this. Now hear this.</i>
<i>Court reporter to sickbay.</i>

01:21:44.191 --> 01:21:48.152
<i>Code Blue. Urgent.</i>
<i>Statements to be taken at once</i>

01:21:48.237 --> 01:21:53.449
<i>from yeomen Burke and Samno.</i>
<i>Repeat. Court reporter to sickbay.</i>

01:21:53.534 --> 01:21:56.786
<i>Code Blue. Urgent.</i>
<i>Statements to be taken.</i>

01:21:57.788 --> 01:22:01.833
<i>Repeat. Statements to be taken</i>
<i>from yeomen Burke and Samno.</i>

01:22:40.873 --> 01:22:42.540
You have to shoot.

01:22:46.378 --> 01:22:50.381
lf you are logical, you have to shoot.

01:22:55.179 --> 01:22:56.471
l do not want to.

01:22:56.555 --> 01:23:00.224
What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.

01:23:01.352 --> 01:23:03.519
l'd just as soon you didn't.

01:23:11.111 --> 01:23:12.987
The operation is over.

01:23:19.203 --> 01:23:22.580
l did not fire. You cannot prove anything.

01:23:22.873 --> 01:23:27.502
Yes, l can. At my trial,
my personal log was used against me.

01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:31.839
How long did you wait outside
my quarters before l noticed you?

01:23:33.759 --> 01:23:35.051
You knew?

01:23:37.304 --> 01:23:40.306
l tried to tell you,
but you would not listen.

01:23:41.350 --> 01:23:44.477
Neither of us was hearing
very well that night, Lieutenant.

01:23:44.561 --> 01:23:48.106
There were things l tried to tell you
about having faith.

01:23:48.357 --> 01:23:50.775
You have betrayed the Federation.

01:23:51.777 --> 01:23:53.152
All of you.

01:23:53.362 --> 01:23:55.029
And what do you think
you've been doing?

01:23:55.114 --> 01:23:58.741
Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.

01:23:59.952 --> 01:24:01.035
Sir.

01:24:02.287 --> 01:24:05.456
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.

01:24:06.166 --> 01:24:09.460
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
"Let them die," you said.

01:24:09.545 --> 01:24:11.462
Did l misinterpret you?

01:24:14.341 --> 01:24:16.092
And you were right.

01:24:17.010 --> 01:24:20.722
They conspired with us
to assassinate their own chancellor.

01:24:20.806 --> 01:24:22.974
How trustworthy can they be?

01:24:23.434 --> 01:24:27.061
Klingons and Federation members
conspiring together?

01:24:27.604 --> 01:24:28.896
Who is "us"?

01:24:28.981 --> 01:24:31.649
Everyone who stands
to lose from peace.

01:24:32.151 --> 01:24:35.903
-Names, Lieutenant.
-My comrades will make certain

01:24:35.988 --> 01:24:39.240
all your ship-to-shore transmissions
are jammed.

01:24:39.324 --> 01:24:40.992
Names, Lieutenant.

01:24:41.493 --> 01:24:43.703
l do not remember.

01:24:46.832 --> 01:24:47.999
A lie?

01:24:49.960 --> 01:24:51.210
A choice.

01:24:55.966 --> 01:24:57.133
Spock?

01:25:41.512 --> 01:25:44.472
Admiral Cartwright.

01:25:45.724 --> 01:25:47.225
From Starfleet?

01:25:55.234 --> 01:25:56.484
Who else?

01:26:01.323 --> 01:26:03.199
-General...
-General...

01:26:04.409 --> 01:26:05.910
-...Chang.
-...Chang.

01:26:11.750 --> 01:26:13.251
Who else?

01:26:13.794 --> 01:26:15.670
-Romulan...
-Romulan...

01:26:15.754 --> 01:26:17.505
-...Ambassador...
-...Ambassador...

01:26:17.589 --> 01:26:19.257
-...Nanclus.
-...Nanclus.

01:26:23.095 --> 01:26:29.851
Where is the peace conference?

01:27:03.802 --> 01:27:05.428
She does not know.

01:27:07.890 --> 01:27:09.473
Then we're dead.

01:27:20.068 --> 01:27:23.321
l've been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.

01:27:25.198 --> 01:27:28.784
-She'll have the coordinates.
-l've already got him, sir.

01:27:29.912 --> 01:27:31.412
<i>Standing by, Captain Kirk.</i>

01:27:31.496 --> 01:27:32.580
Sulu!

01:27:32.998 --> 01:27:37.209
You realise that by even talking to us,
you're violating regulations.

01:27:37.336 --> 01:27:40.171
<i>l'm sorry, Captain.</i>
<i>Your message is breaking up.</i>

01:27:40.255 --> 01:27:43.341
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?

01:27:44.176 --> 01:27:46.135
They're going to attempt
another assassination.

01:27:46.219 --> 01:27:49.972
<i>The conference is at Camp Khitomer,</i>
<i>near the Romulan border.</i>

01:27:50.974 --> 01:27:54.268
<i>l'm sending the exact coordinates</i>
<i>on a coded frequency.</i>

01:27:54.353 --> 01:27:56.354
l'm afraid
we're gonna need more than that.

01:27:56.438 --> 01:27:58.981
There's a bird-of-prey
on the lookout for us,

01:27:59.066 --> 01:28:00.608
and she can fire while cloaked.

01:28:00.692 --> 01:28:02.109
<i>Surely not.</i>

01:28:02.194 --> 01:28:05.071
Hold on.
How many of those things are there?

01:28:05.489 --> 01:28:07.239
Come on, Lieutenant.

01:28:07.866 --> 01:28:10.576
-Just the prototype.
-You hear that?

01:28:11.203 --> 01:28:14.789
<i>l'm getting underway now,</i>
<i>but we're now in Alpha Quadrant.</i>

01:28:14.873 --> 01:28:18.250
<i>The chances of our reaching</i>
<i>the conference in time are slim.</i>

01:28:18.335 --> 01:28:20.670
When does this conference start?

01:28:20.754 --> 01:28:23.255
<i>According to my information, today.</i>

01:28:24.591 --> 01:28:26.384
Thank you, Captain Sulu.

01:28:26.593 --> 01:28:28.094
<i>Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.</i>

01:28:34.893 --> 01:28:36.060
Spock?

01:28:37.479 --> 01:28:39.105
l prefer it dark.

01:28:46.405 --> 01:28:47.989
Dining on ashes?

01:28:48.949 --> 01:28:50.491
You were right.

01:28:50.909 --> 01:28:56.330
lt was arrogant presumption on my part
that got us into this situation.

01:28:58.250 --> 01:29:01.085
You and the doctor
might have been killed.

01:29:01.753 --> 01:29:03.504
The night is young.

01:29:04.423 --> 01:29:08.926
You said it yourself. lt was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.

01:29:12.889 --> 01:29:15.016
You're a great one for logic.

01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:18.728
l'm a great one for rushing in
where angels fear to tread.

01:29:20.397 --> 01:29:22.273
We're both extremists.

01:29:22.649 --> 01:29:25.693
Reality is probably
somewhere in between.

01:29:30.782 --> 01:29:33.534
l couldn't get past the death of my son.

01:29:33.952 --> 01:29:37.997
l was prejudiced
by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.

01:29:39.124 --> 01:29:42.793
Gorkon had to die before l understood
how prejudiced l was.

01:29:50.677 --> 01:29:55.097
ls it possible that we two, you and l,

01:29:56.058 --> 01:30:00.394
have grown so old and so inflexible

01:30:01.313 --> 01:30:03.898
that we have outlived our usefulness?

01:30:06.151 --> 01:30:08.694
Would that constitute a joke?

01:30:10.197 --> 01:30:12.406
Don't crucify yourself.
lt wasn't your fault.

01:30:12.491 --> 01:30:14.158
l was responsible.

01:30:15.535 --> 01:30:19.872
-For no actions but your own.
-That is not what you said at your trial.

01:30:21.166 --> 01:30:23.417
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...

01:30:23.502 --> 01:30:26.796
But, Captain, we both know
that l am not human.

01:30:27.297 --> 01:30:30.674
Spock, you want to know something?
Everybody's human.

01:30:31.718 --> 01:30:34.845
l find that remark insulting.

01:30:36.264 --> 01:30:37.431
Come on. l need you.

01:30:41.978 --> 01:30:43.604
<i>Madam ChanceIIor,</i>

01:30:44.481 --> 01:30:48.692
<i>members of the Diplomatic Corps,</i>
<i>honoured guests,</i>

01:30:50.362 --> 01:30:54.281
<i>the United Federation of Planets</i>
<i>welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.</i>

01:31:11.508 --> 01:31:13.759
She's out here somewhere.

01:31:14.219 --> 01:31:16.178
But if she is cloaked...

01:31:16.805 --> 01:31:18.973
Then all we have
is a neutron radiation surge,

01:31:19.057 --> 01:31:22.143
and by the time we're close enough
to record it, we're ashes.

01:31:22.227 --> 01:31:23.644
209.

01:31:26.648 --> 01:31:27.857
206.

01:31:31.486 --> 01:31:32.987
203.

01:31:34.614 --> 01:31:39.326
-Close enough to beam down?
-Not yet, Captain. ln two minutes. 1 58.

01:31:41.371 --> 01:31:44.498
-Go to impulse power for Khitomer orbit.
-Aye, sir.

01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:58.637
<i>Let us redefine progress to mean</i>
<i>thatjust because we can do a thing,</i>

01:31:58.722 --> 01:32:03.142
<i>it does not necessarily follow</i>
<i>that we must do that thing.</i>

01:32:06.938 --> 01:32:09.023
-Uhura?
-Nothing, Captain.

01:32:09.774 --> 01:32:12.818
lf she's here,
she's rigged for silent running.

01:32:19.701 --> 01:32:22.786
<i>Coming up on transporter range</i>
<i>in 57 seconds.</i>

01:32:23.788 --> 01:32:26.457
<i>Transporter Room,</i>
<i>stand by to beam down.</i>

01:32:29.628 --> 01:32:30.669
<i>...53...</i>

01:32:35.508 --> 01:32:36.884
<i>...48 seconds.</i>

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:43.432
...44...

01:32:46.728 --> 01:32:48.562
<i>l can see you, Kirk.</i>

01:32:50.482 --> 01:32:51.649
Chang.

01:32:52.817 --> 01:32:54.360
<i>Can you see me?</i>

01:32:55.528 --> 01:32:59.573
Now, be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior,

01:33:00.367 --> 01:33:04.119
<i>you do prefer it this way, don't you?</i>
<i>As it was meant to be.</i>

01:33:04.871 --> 01:33:07.039
<i>No peace in our time.</i>

01:33:07.749 --> 01:33:12.503
<i>"Once more unto the breach,</i>
<i>dear friends."</i>

01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:31.772
-This is fun.
-Reverse engines. All astern.

01:33:31.856 --> 01:33:35.025
One and a half impulse power.
Back off! Back off!

01:33:39.364 --> 01:33:41.031
What's she doing?

01:33:41.825 --> 01:33:43.701
What's she waiting for?

01:33:44.703 --> 01:33:48.122
Probably attempting to ascertain
why we are reversing,

01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:50.874
wondering whether we detect her.

01:33:56.214 --> 01:33:57.464
lncoming!

01:34:01.886 --> 01:34:04.471
-ln range?
-Not yet, sir.

01:34:04.556 --> 01:34:05.973
Come on. Come on.

01:34:06.057 --> 01:34:08.058
-She'll fly apart.
-Fly her apart, then!

01:34:08.643 --> 01:34:12.438
<i>Many speculated</i>
<i>about my father's motives.</i>

01:34:13.732 --> 01:34:16.692
<i>There were those who said</i>
<i>he was an idealist.</i>

01:34:16.860 --> 01:34:19.069
<i>Others said he had no choice.</i>

01:34:19.654 --> 01:34:23.407
<i>lf Praxis had not exploded,</i>
<i>then quite possibly his idealism</i>

01:34:23.658 --> 01:34:28.203
<i>would not have found expression.</i>
<i>We are a proud race,</i>

01:34:28.788 --> 01:34:33.500
<i>and we are here because</i>
<i>we intend to go on being proud.</i>

01:34:43.386 --> 01:34:47.431
-Go to auxiliary power!
-Auxiliary circuits destroyed, Captain.

01:34:53.438 --> 01:34:57.441
"Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?

01:34:58.109 --> 01:34:59.443
"Wrong us,

01:35:00.737 --> 01:35:02.529
"shall we not revenge?"

01:35:03.490 --> 01:35:04.573
Gas.

01:35:06.493 --> 01:35:10.996
Gas, Captain. Under impulse power,
she expends fuel like any other vessel.

01:35:11.331 --> 01:35:14.041
We call it plasma,
but whatever the Klingon designation,

01:35:14.125 --> 01:35:16.377
it is merely ionized gas.

01:35:17.087 --> 01:35:19.713
Well, what about all
of that equipment we're carrying

01:35:19.798 --> 01:35:21.965
to catalogue gaseous anomalies?

01:35:24.260 --> 01:35:28.889
-Well, the thing's gotta have a tailpipe.
-Doctor, would you care to assist me

01:35:28.973 --> 01:35:32.309
-in performing surgery on a torpedo?
-Fascinating.

01:35:34.187 --> 01:35:35.854
Hard to starboard!

01:35:37.774 --> 01:35:42.277
<i>The proposed agenda is as follows.</i>
<i>The total evacuation of Kronos</i>

01:35:42.362 --> 01:35:46.115
<i>has been calculated</i>
<i>within the 50-Earth-year time span.</i>

01:35:46.199 --> 01:35:48.700
<i>Phase one, preparation for evacuation.</i>

01:35:55.500 --> 01:35:57.167
Come on, reach up!

01:35:59.003 --> 01:36:02.965
Captain! She's packing quite a wallop!
Shields weakening!

01:36:10.849 --> 01:36:12.850
Shields up. All right.

01:36:12.934 --> 01:36:14.852
Now we've given them
something else to shoot at.

01:36:14.936 --> 01:36:16.186
Aye, sir.

01:36:22.861 --> 01:36:24.736
The game's afoot, huh?

01:36:33.037 --> 01:36:37.040
-Excelsior's been hit.
<i>-"Our reveIs now are ended," Kirk.</i>

01:36:45.967 --> 01:36:50.888
"Cry 'Havoc!'
and let slip the dogs of war."

01:36:52.015 --> 01:36:54.057
Bones, where's my torpedo?

01:36:54.142 --> 01:36:55.809
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed.

01:36:55.894 --> 01:36:57.978
Emergency power!
Gravity control down!

01:36:58.062 --> 01:36:59.771
Shields collapsing!

01:37:02.066 --> 01:37:04.193
The key, please, Doctor. Time is short.

01:37:12.994 --> 01:37:14.411
The hull has been compromised.

01:37:14.496 --> 01:37:17.080
-l wonder how bad?
-Connect echobars.

01:37:17.207 --> 01:37:19.791
<i>...to discuss the report on phase two.</i>

01:37:20.084 --> 01:37:22.920
-Alter circuit "A."
-Sensor.

01:37:23.254 --> 01:37:26.173
<i>l propose that we commence</i>
<i>with the minutes of the preparation.</i>

01:37:26.466 --> 01:37:29.176
<i>"I am constant as the northern star."</i>

01:37:29.260 --> 01:37:31.803
l'd give real money if he'd shut up.

01:37:31.930 --> 01:37:33.222
-Plate, please.
-Plate.

01:37:33.306 --> 01:37:35.057
<i>...and assimilation will consume...</i>

01:37:35.141 --> 01:37:37.017
We've got a heartbeat.

01:37:38.186 --> 01:37:40.187
<i>The Klingon empire, the ecological...</i>

01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:42.064
-Key, please.
-Key.

01:37:42.148 --> 01:37:43.565
<i>Where's that damn torpedo?</i>

01:37:43.650 --> 01:37:45.984
She's ready, Jim. Lock and load.

01:37:48.613 --> 01:37:49.738
Fire.

01:38:02.585 --> 01:38:03.794
To be,

01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:05.671
or not

01:38:06.506 --> 01:38:07.798
to be.

01:38:09.551 --> 01:38:11.635
Target that explosion and fire.

01:38:13.596 --> 01:38:14.596
Fire.

01:38:25.316 --> 01:38:27.401
<i>As l imagine this work will occupy us</i>

01:38:27.485 --> 01:38:30.362
<i>throughout most of the week,</i>
<i>it would be my hope</i>

01:38:30.446 --> 01:38:32.864
<i>that the delegation</i>
<i>could return to their capitals</i>

01:38:32.949 --> 01:38:35.367
<i>to implement the provisions</i>
<i>of phase one,</i>

01:38:35.451 --> 01:38:37.703
<i>no later than the first of next month.</i>

01:38:37.787 --> 01:38:38.787
Scotty.

01:38:38.871 --> 01:38:41.373
<i>As you know, time is of the essence.</i>

01:38:42.333 --> 01:38:44.668
-Out of the way!
-Out of the way!

01:38:46.087 --> 01:38:47.588
Mr President!

01:38:49.507 --> 01:38:51.717
Mr President! Mr President!

01:38:52.677 --> 01:38:54.177
Mr President!

01:38:56.306 --> 01:38:57.931
Kirk, Enterprise.

01:39:00.101 --> 01:39:01.602
Protect the Chancellor!

01:39:09.068 --> 01:39:11.570
-Arrest those men!
-Arrest yourself.

01:39:16.826 --> 01:39:18.952
We've got a full confession.

01:39:34.052 --> 01:39:36.053
Cartwright, just a minute.

01:39:38.389 --> 01:39:41.683
What's happened?
What's the meaning of all of this?

01:39:42.143 --> 01:39:44.895
lt's about the future, Madam Chancellor.

01:39:45.188 --> 01:39:48.315
Some people think the future
means the end of history.

01:39:48.399 --> 01:39:52.402
Well, we haven't run out
of history quite yet.

01:39:54.906 --> 01:39:58.075
Your father called the future

01:39:59.243 --> 01:40:01.244
the undiscovered country.

01:40:04.749 --> 01:40:07.417
People can be very frightened
of change.

01:40:12.423 --> 01:40:14.883
You've restored my father's faith.

01:40:15.802 --> 01:40:18.011
And you've restored my son's.

01:41:06.894 --> 01:41:09.730
Once again, we've saved civilisation
as we know it.

01:41:09.814 --> 01:41:12.274
And the good news is,
they're not going to prosecute.

01:41:12.358 --> 01:41:16.236
They might as well have prosecuted me.
l felt like Lieutenant Valeris.

01:41:16.320 --> 01:41:19.197
Well, they don't arrest people
for having feelings.

01:41:19.282 --> 01:41:23.869
And it's a good thing, too. lf they did,
we'd all have to turn ourselves in.

01:41:25.997 --> 01:41:27.456
<i>Captain Kirk.</i>

01:41:27.999 --> 01:41:29.458
Captain Sulu.

01:41:30.418 --> 01:41:34.129
As much to the crew of the Enterprise,
l owe you my thanks.

01:41:34.797 --> 01:41:38.216
<i>Nice to see you in action</i>
<i>one more time, Captain Kirk.</i>

01:41:38.801 --> 01:41:40.135
<i>Take care.</i>

01:41:52.273 --> 01:41:54.357
By God, that's a big ship.

01:41:54.817 --> 01:42:00.781
-Not so big as her captain, l think.
-So, this is goodbye.

01:42:02.325 --> 01:42:05.285
l think it's about time
we got underway ourselves.

01:42:05.369 --> 01:42:08.747
Captain, l have orders
from Starfleet Command.

01:42:08.831 --> 01:42:11.541
We're to put back
to spacedock immediately

01:42:11.626 --> 01:42:13.418
to be decommissioned.

01:42:28.601 --> 01:42:30.227
lf l were human,

01:42:30.895 --> 01:42:33.230
l believe my response would be,

01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:35.899
"Go to hell."

01:42:39.695 --> 01:42:41.279
lf l were human.

01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:47.619
Course heading, Captain?

01:42:53.835 --> 01:42:55.919
Second star to the right,

01:42:57.755 --> 01:42:59.881
and straight on till morning.

01:43:17.316 --> 01:43:20.402
<i>Captain's Log, Stardate 9529.1 .</i>

01:43:21.404 --> 01:43:23.947
<i>This is the final cruise</i>
ofthe Starship Enterprise

01:43:24.031 --> 01:43:25.532
<i>under my command.</i>

01:43:25.825 --> 01:43:31.037
<i>This ship and her history will shortly</i>
<i>become the care of another crew.</i>

01:43:31.122 --> 01:43:34.541
<i>To them and their posterity</i>
<i>will we commit our future.</i>

01:43:35.167 --> 01:43:37.669
<i>They will continue the voyages</i>
<i>we have begun,</i>

01:43:37.753 --> 01:43:40.213
<i>and journey to all</i>
<i>the undiscovered countries,</i>

01:43:40.298 --> 01:43:42.465
<i>boldly going where no man...</i>

01:43:43.259 --> 01:43:44.801
<i>Where no one</i>
