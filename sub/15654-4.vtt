00:04.520 --> 00:07.640
[Charlie]<i> They've found your girl Grace.</i>
<i>She was murdered, Bill.</i>

00:07.720 --> 00:09.040
<i>Her and Adam Elliot.</i>

00:09.120 --> 00:11.440
[Lee]<i> I need to get to Braeston.</i>
<i>Finish something that I started.</i>

00:11.520 --> 00:12.720
[thunder]

00:12.800 --> 00:15.680
[Juliet]<i> What would you do if the man</i>
<i>who murdered your children</i>

00:15.760 --> 00:17.560
<i>ended up on your doorstep</i>
<i>that same day?</i>

00:17.640 --> 00:19.520
[Rob]<i> We have to get rid of the body.</i>

00:20.520 --> 00:24.320
There's this pill.
It sends you quietly off to sleep.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.880
I can't do that Meredith.

00:25.960 --> 00:29.160
[Maddy]<i> A friend of mine from school.</i>
<i>she's dead.</i>

00:29.240 --> 00:31.840
They made it look like a Smurf.
It's sick.

00:31.920 --> 00:34.360
It's in your interest
to make sure I'm not arrested.

00:34.440 --> 00:38.320
But if I get picked up,
you sure as shit are too.

00:38.400 --> 00:39.920
[Claire]<i> We found it, Rob.</i>

00:40.000 --> 00:43.040
<i>The bloodstained knife you hid</i>
<i>in your bedroom, in the fireplace.</i>

00:43.120 --> 00:44.360
I never hid anything there.

00:44.440 --> 00:46.600
[Andrew]<i> I take it</i>
<i>you've not checked your emails.</i>

00:46.680 --> 00:49.280
We both received one this morning
from Jamie Douglas.

00:49.360 --> 00:50.880
[Jamie]<i> I kept us out of it.</i>

00:50.960 --> 00:54.800
<i>Said in my email that all we knew</i>
<i>was Rob coming by the house,</i>

00:54.880 --> 00:56.800
<i>talking about someone</i>
<i>crashing into the fence.</i>

00:56.880 --> 00:59.400
Jamie, what have you done?

00:59.480 --> 01:03.040
[Juliet]<i> Why did Lee Walsh</i>
<i>come up to your house in the first place?</i>

01:03.120 --> 01:04.920
<i>We're going to find out what happened.</i>

01:05.000 --> 01:07.560
Look, I did it. I killed him

01:07.640 --> 01:09.840
[Bill on tape]<i> Carry on,</i>
<i>and you're going straight to hell.</i>

01:09.920 --> 01:11.800
[Claire]<i> I saw something on that tape.</i>

01:11.880 --> 01:13.680
Tell me the truth, Bill.

01:13.760 --> 01:16.720
Is this something
to do with why Adam was killed?

01:59.160 --> 02:01.320
Of course it bloody matters!

02:01.400 --> 02:03.200
Tell me the truth, Bill.

02:03.280 --> 02:05.200
What did you say to my brother?

02:06.200 --> 02:08.600
Why can't you leave things
well alone, uh?

02:10.400 --> 02:12.640
Why do you have to pick at things, girl?

02:12.720 --> 02:14.440
Over and over again?

02:14.520 --> 02:16.560
What were you arguing about?

02:20.040 --> 02:22.200
You're not going to like it, Claire.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.720
He was seeing someone else.

02:30.840 --> 02:32.720
Another woman.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.120
Just before the wedding.

02:35.200 --> 02:38.400
I saw them together in Edinburgh.
A few weeks ago, when I was there.

02:38.480 --> 02:41.520
No. Not Adam.

02:41.600 --> 02:44.840
You asked me to tell you the truth,
Claire, and there it is.

02:44.920 --> 02:47.640
That's the truth.
Are you happier now?

02:48.840 --> 02:50.880
I knew Adam.
We spoke nearly every day.

02:50.960 --> 02:52.280
Something like that...

02:52.360 --> 02:53.880
Oh, he felt bad.

02:53.960 --> 02:56.600
Sure. He hated himself.

02:56.680 --> 02:58.240
He promised me he'd end it.

02:58.320 --> 03:01.880
And I told him to, in no uncertain terms,
to save Grace's feelings.

03:03.760 --> 03:06.160
You handed him something in that video.

03:06.240 --> 03:08.000
You told him
he was going straight to hell.

03:08.080 --> 03:10.000
His marriage certificate.

03:11.480 --> 03:13.520
I had it in my pocket.

03:13.600 --> 03:16.120
I was keeping it safe for him.

03:16.200 --> 03:20.040
I showed it to him to remind him
of the vows he was breaking.

03:20.120 --> 03:22.000
Of the commitments he was flaunting

03:22.080 --> 03:24.640
in the face of God,
of his family, of his friends.

03:24.720 --> 03:26.320
Why didn't he come to me?

03:27.920 --> 03:29.720
He was ashamed.

03:32.200 --> 03:33.720
You know,

03:33.800 --> 03:36.360
I think after everything that's passed...

03:36.440 --> 03:38.040
he made a mistake.

03:39.480 --> 03:40.880
He felt bad.

03:42.640 --> 03:46.400
At the end of the day,
we're all of us just human.

03:49.760 --> 03:52.240
Don't let it change
the way you remember him.

04:00.000 --> 04:01.680
I've gotta go.

04:09.280 --> 04:12.240
What about that one?
It has three pools.

04:12.320 --> 04:15.080
What are we going to do
with three pools?

04:15.160 --> 04:17.640
Well, maybe
they're different temperatures.

04:18.720 --> 04:21.200
And it's got six restaurants!

04:21.279 --> 04:23.720
I said we could stay somewhere nice
after the operation,

04:23.800 --> 04:26.160
not somewhere only
Richard Branson can afford.

04:26.240 --> 04:30.000
Fine. I'll limit myself to places
with just the one pool.

04:30.080 --> 04:32.080
-If you'd be so kind.
-[phone rings]

04:33.040 --> 04:34.680
It's meant to be your day off.

04:34.760 --> 04:36.000
I'll be quick.

04:38.280 --> 04:39.360
Hello.

04:40.360 --> 04:42.400
Hi. Is that DI Wallis?

04:42.480 --> 04:45.360
Yeah, it's Constable Hartley,
at Niddrie Station.

04:46.160 --> 04:49.040
I've got someone in lockup here
says they want to talk to you.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.640
About the case.

04:51.400 --> 04:54.200
His name's... Jay Clark.
You know him?

04:58.960 --> 05:00.480
Yep. Will do.

05:08.680 --> 05:10.240
-What happened?
-Sorry to call you.

05:10.320 --> 05:11.680
No, it's fine. What happened?

05:11.760 --> 05:14.920
Victoria was changing her bed
and knocked open her drawer by mistake.

05:15.000 --> 05:18.200
Out came a whole handful of pills
gathered from the other patients.

05:18.280 --> 05:20.400
She must've been doing it
for a while now.

05:20.480 --> 05:23.080
The only reason someone would amass
a pharmacy like that...

05:23.160 --> 05:24.480
I know.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.280
The only person she'll see is you.

05:28.200 --> 05:29.920
I'm just forgetful, that's all.

05:31.720 --> 05:34.480
I keep picking up pills
I think are mine,

05:34.560 --> 05:37.440
and putting them in
that cupboard there.

05:38.680 --> 05:42.400
I'd forgot about them until that lady
knocked them out by mistake.

05:42.480 --> 05:44.320
You and I both know that's not true.

05:47.160 --> 05:49.040
Aye, we do.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.440
And only us.

05:52.040 --> 05:53.720
-This is my fault.
-No.

05:53.800 --> 05:55.040
If I'd helped you...

05:55.120 --> 05:58.760
[Meredith] I asked...
and you gave your answer.

05:59.120 --> 06:01.480
You have nothing to apologize for.

06:01.560 --> 06:03.680
Except you're not going to stop trying,
are you?

06:03.760 --> 06:05.560
[Meredith] It's what I want.

06:06.360 --> 06:08.320
I'm ready.

06:08.400 --> 06:11.640
And I want to end it on my terms.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.360
Or die trying.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.040
OK.

06:27.600 --> 06:29.280
-I'll do it.
-Darling.

06:29.360 --> 06:30.880
You don't have to.

06:32.520 --> 06:34.080
I'll help you.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.880
[Claire sobs]

07:17.960 --> 07:20.600
I'm here to see Rob. Rob Elliot.

07:23.120 --> 07:24.600
[door slams]

07:30.320 --> 07:33.560
Elliot. You've already got a visitor.

07:54.160 --> 07:56.280
[sobs]

08:13.720 --> 08:16.000
I just need five minutes.

08:20.200 --> 08:22.880
[Jay] I've never been so pleased
to see a pig in all my life.

08:22.960 --> 08:25.120
Don't get too excited,
I'm not here to let you out.

08:26.080 --> 08:27.840
Well, you best be soon.

08:29.040 --> 08:31.480
Because they want to know
the name of my supplier.

08:31.560 --> 08:34.120
You know it's your word
against mine.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.679
Yeah, you're right.

08:35.760 --> 08:38.039
True. True.

08:40.840 --> 08:42.520
Except, um...

08:44.480 --> 08:47.520
I have audio recordings of every single
one of our conversations.

08:49.680 --> 08:52.800
You think I'd go into business
without taking out insurance?

08:52.880 --> 08:55.960
And before you go looking,
I don't keep them at my flat.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.600
Don't say anything.

09:00.680 --> 09:03.800
I'll talk to your dealer,
the guy who gave up your name,

09:03.880 --> 09:05.720
and I'll get him to retract
his testimony.

09:07.960 --> 09:10.480
You're in over your head,
aren't you, Grandma?

09:10.560 --> 09:13.440
I'll get it done. Just give me some time.

09:13.520 --> 09:16.960
Well, you've got till six tonight,
cos that's when they gotta charge me.

09:17.040 --> 09:18.840
So if I don't hear from you by then...

09:23.320 --> 09:25.080
Thanks.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.800
[sighs]

09:53.680 --> 09:56.560
The redirect on Adam's post
has come through

09:56.640 --> 09:59.440
and I've been on the phone
for the last hour

09:59.520 --> 10:02.600
trying to cancel his gas and other...

10:03.720 --> 10:07.280
Trying to explain to a complete
stranger that my son is...

10:07.360 --> 10:09.880
You don't have to do that, Mum.

10:09.960 --> 10:11.360
Let me.

10:16.520 --> 10:18.760
[ringing tone]

10:21.480 --> 10:23.600
Adam Elliot.

10:23.680 --> 10:26.520
No, I'm not the account holder,
I'm calling because he...

10:26.600 --> 10:28.520
He passed away.

10:28.600 --> 10:30.360
I need to cancel the account.

10:31.600 --> 10:32.920
Yeah. I'll hold.

10:33.880 --> 10:39.400
-Is everything OK at work?
-Fine. Thanks.

10:52.120 --> 10:55.200
Mum, do you recognize that number?

10:56.040 --> 10:57.520
-[Louise] Which?
-This one.

10:57.600 --> 10:58.680
Um...

10:59.920 --> 11:03.480
Well, it does look a bit familiar,
but I can't...

11:04.760 --> 11:07.240
You know I don't really have
a head for numbers.

11:11.240 --> 11:13.000
Let me see.

11:17.200 --> 11:19.600
He made these calls
when he was on honeymoon.

11:19.680 --> 11:23.400
Look... Five calls to the same number
at four in the morning.

11:25.400 --> 11:29.040
-What are you talking about, darling?
-It's Bill Douglas's mobile number.

11:29.120 --> 11:32.320
He didn't call any of us from honeymoon,
but he called Bill.

11:32.400 --> 11:34.280
Five times.

11:34.360 --> 11:38.000
What was so important that he needed
to call him at four in the morning?

11:43.560 --> 11:45.200
[door opens]

11:51.840 --> 11:53.360
Sal?

11:55.600 --> 11:57.840
No need to look so surprised.

12:00.480 --> 12:01.760
[sighs]

12:03.520 --> 12:07.120
I cook you meals.
Breakfast, lunch and dinner.

12:07.200 --> 12:09.360
Try and look nice for you.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.160
Can't afford anything fancy, mind.

12:11.240 --> 12:14.400
I'm not exactly catwalk-ready,
but I try.

12:14.480 --> 12:16.560
I do try to look nice for you.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.160
I laugh at your jokes, too.

12:21.360 --> 12:23.000
Even when they're not funny.

12:25.440 --> 12:27.720
I do all these things for you,

12:27.800 --> 12:30.640
day in, day out, year after year.

12:33.760 --> 12:36.040
But that doesn't make me stupid, Alastair.

12:37.600 --> 12:41.120
I don't do them because cleaning up
after you gives me so much joy, do I?

12:42.240 --> 12:46.080
I do those things because
that's what we signed up for.

12:46.160 --> 12:48.120
-Sal...
-No, I'm talking now!

12:48.200 --> 12:50.080
This is when I talk!

12:54.560 --> 12:57.800
I know about what you and Moira
have been up to.

12:59.440 --> 13:01.880
Because, like I said,
I'm not stupid.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.200
I've known for the last two years.

13:08.200 --> 13:12.080
I didn't do anything about it
because I was scared.

13:12.160 --> 13:13.760
Scared I'd be left with nothing.

13:13.840 --> 13:16.280
Even though it went against
everything I believe

13:16.360 --> 13:18.480
about what's right and wrong
in a marriage,

13:18.560 --> 13:21.400
about what I thought I'd do when
I was faced with such a thing.

13:21.480 --> 13:22.720
Please...

13:22.800 --> 13:26.680
[Sal] And then what happened
with Adam and Grace.

13:26.760 --> 13:29.200
Well, it just made me stop and think...

13:30.600 --> 13:33.120
how bloody short life is.

13:35.320 --> 13:39.880
And then after you told me about
all what you'd done...

13:42.120 --> 13:45.240
I just finally saw my chance to do
something for me.

13:47.400 --> 13:49.680
Getting that money.

13:49.760 --> 13:53.280
Well, I've got something now,
haven't I?

13:53.360 --> 13:55.800
An incentive. A reason to go.

13:56.800 --> 13:58.800
Finally, I get something.

14:03.680 --> 14:06.040
It's not your money, Sal.

14:08.960 --> 14:11.960
Oh, it is when you take out
all the cash out of the account.

14:17.920 --> 14:20.640
I didn't bring it with me.

14:22.960 --> 14:25.320
Like I said, I'm not that stupid.

14:26.920 --> 14:28.600
In fact, you keep it.

14:29.320 --> 14:31.320
You keep it.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.760
I'll buy myself some new things.

14:34.600 --> 14:36.960
Treat myself to something nice.

14:43.920 --> 14:45.600
[engine starts]

14:51.240 --> 14:52.680
[breathes deeply]

14:58.240 --> 15:03.440
[vicar]<i> As it's written in Romans,</i>
<i>"Do not be conformed to this world,</i>

15:03.520 --> 15:08.080
but be transformed
by the renewal of your mind,

15:08.160 --> 15:13.480
that by testing you may discern
what is the will of God."

15:14.920 --> 15:18.800
"What is good and acceptable
and perfect."

15:27.120 --> 15:28.560
Hello?

16:10.560 --> 16:12.000
What are you doing?

16:14.440 --> 16:16.760
Why are you looking through Dad's stuff?

16:19.280 --> 16:20.600
I...

16:21.880 --> 16:23.840
I thought you'd be at church.

16:23.920 --> 16:27.440
Yeah, well, a lot's changed recently.

16:30.040 --> 16:31.800
Rob's in prison because of you.

16:33.120 --> 16:36.000
Because he confessed.
He told them he was guilty.

16:38.120 --> 16:39.560
[sighs]

16:41.120 --> 16:43.840
How long have you been reading
my conversations with Sam?

16:44.760 --> 16:46.920
A while. On and off.

16:49.440 --> 16:53.040
A couple of years back,
you and Adam were chatting,

16:53.120 --> 16:55.880
He said your password
for everything was "butterfly."

16:55.960 --> 16:57.720
So I just tried it once.

16:59.240 --> 17:00.920
I never meant to.

17:03.680 --> 17:05.240
I'm so sorry.

17:10.480 --> 17:12.920
I promise I won't try it on again.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.720
[laughs]

17:19.000 --> 17:24.280
It's just... everything recently...
has gone wrong.

17:25.359 --> 17:26.680
Dad's got Parkinson's.

17:28.200 --> 17:31.240
Oh, Jamie. I'm so sorry.

17:31.320 --> 17:34.360
[Jamie] After he heard,
I had to go in and get tested.

17:35.800 --> 17:39.640
All these secrets.
Stuck out here in the middle of nowhere.

17:41.440 --> 17:44.160
You start to lose yourself.

17:45.720 --> 17:47.280
Oh, come here.

17:47.360 --> 17:49.200
[sobs]

17:51.040 --> 17:53.080
[Claire] You can talk to me, you know.

17:54.080 --> 17:56.920
I'm just up the road. Any time.

18:06.080 --> 18:08.040
So, what were you looking for?

18:12.560 --> 18:15.400
It should be... Yeah, here.

18:15.480 --> 18:17.240
[vehicle approaches]

18:17.320 --> 18:20.200
Shit, he should've been out
all morning.

18:20.280 --> 18:23.320
Here, take it.
Go out the back door. Go on, go.

18:23.400 --> 18:24.600
Thank you.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.000
[doorbell rings]

19:48.960 --> 19:52.200
[Bill] Jamie, what's that taxi
doing outside?

19:52.280 --> 19:53.720
Ja...

19:55.000 --> 19:56.720
Sal?

19:56.800 --> 19:58.840
[Sal] Jamie's upstairs.

19:58.920 --> 20:02.080
I thought it best,
given the circumstances.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.440
What's this about?

20:06.280 --> 20:08.840
-Do you want a cup of tea, or...
-[Sal] No.

20:08.920 --> 20:10.480
I won't.

20:11.840 --> 20:14.640
I came here to say my piece,
that's all.

20:15.800 --> 20:19.280
-I'll say my piece and leave.
-[Bill] Is this about me firing Alastair?

20:20.560 --> 20:22.920
No. It's not about that.

20:25.960 --> 20:28.520
-He needs to know, Moira.
-[Bill] Know what?

20:29.640 --> 20:32.320
[Sal] I told Alastair
I was leaving him this morning.

20:35.600 --> 20:38.440
I've known that
he and Moira have been...

20:40.240 --> 20:41.800
for a while.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.880
And I finally did something about it.

20:45.960 --> 20:50.880
I thought you should know because...
maybe you'd want to do the same.

20:51.400 --> 20:53.080
[Bill whispers] No.

20:56.400 --> 20:59.760
[Sal] They'd go to a hotel in Inverness,

20:59.840 --> 21:02.120
two or three times a month.

21:02.200 --> 21:04.360
I went there once.

21:04.440 --> 21:06.680
I saw them have dinner.

21:06.760 --> 21:11.400
Their legs sliding up and down each
other like a couple of teenagers.

21:11.480 --> 21:13.760
Get out. Go on.

21:15.720 --> 21:16.880
Get out.

21:16.960 --> 21:20.760
-It's true, Bill.
-Get out of my house!

21:20.840 --> 21:23.040
You're rotten! Both of you!

21:23.120 --> 21:26.000
Rotten to your bastard bones!

21:27.920 --> 21:29.680
Now, get out!

21:58.160 --> 21:59.760
[gasps]

22:28.000 --> 22:31.160
They're gonna start wondering
why you're so interested in me.

22:33.360 --> 22:35.440
How's this for a deal?

22:36.880 --> 22:40.560
Say one word about me
and I'll ruin you.

22:42.840 --> 22:45.120
What are you talking about?

22:45.200 --> 22:48.160
Before I got this job,
I worked in computer crime.

22:48.240 --> 22:52.440
Sex offenders mainly, child pornography.
Horrible job.

22:52.520 --> 22:56.320
But I learned a lot.
A lot of technical stuff.

22:57.960 --> 23:00.840
I got a hold of some material
and put it on a USB stick.

23:00.920 --> 23:03.400
It wouldn't be hard for me
to go to an evidence locker

23:03.480 --> 23:06.280
and upload what's on there
onto your laptop.

23:06.720 --> 23:09.840
The material on there could put you in
prison, same as you're facing now.

23:09.920 --> 23:14.320
More. More time, probably,
but in this version,

23:14.400 --> 23:16.920
you spend time
in the sex offenders' wing.

23:17.800 --> 23:21.560
In this version, when you do finally
get out, you go on the register.

23:21.640 --> 23:25.560
In this version, you're branded
a pedophile for the rest of your life.

23:26.840 --> 23:30.160
You know what people do to pedophiles
when they find they live on their street.

23:32.400 --> 23:34.280
You wouldn't do that.

23:35.160 --> 23:36.320
I mean...

23:38.360 --> 23:41.000
-That's evil.
-Self-preservation, isn't it?

23:41.080 --> 23:44.080
But you're not like that,
y-you couldn't do it!

23:44.880 --> 23:46.880
Am I not?

23:51.400 --> 23:53.400
My offer's the same.
You've got until six tonight,

23:53.480 --> 23:55.680
then I'm telling everybody
that wants to know.

23:55.760 --> 23:57.440
[door opens]

23:57.520 --> 24:00.920
[officer] Just got a call. Someone's
waiting for you back at your station.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.920
-Says it's urgent.
-Right.

24:26.720 --> 24:28.240
[Moira] Bill.

24:29.360 --> 24:30.840
[Bill] How long?

24:36.080 --> 24:38.160
You and Alastair. How long?

24:41.240 --> 24:43.240
When we first...

24:44.760 --> 24:48.040
-You were away. I was lonely.
-Don't give me excuses!

24:49.440 --> 24:51.000
[Moira] Well, no. You're right.

24:52.600 --> 24:55.080
I wasn't lonely
because you were away.

24:56.520 --> 25:01.240
I was lonely because I always am.
Even when you're here.

25:01.320 --> 25:04.200
And so you're absolved of all blame.

25:04.280 --> 25:07.160
I make you cheat.
I make you lonely.

25:07.240 --> 25:09.880
[Moira] Oh, spare me the judgment.
That's not what I'm saying.

25:09.960 --> 25:11.760
I'm not blaming anyone.

25:13.400 --> 25:15.200
I'm just trying to tell you...

25:18.160 --> 25:21.080
I didn't set out
to do something wrong.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.200
I was lonely and it happened.

25:26.800 --> 25:29.280
Is that what you told yourself
the last time?

25:31.880 --> 25:35.200
It's not the first time you've betrayed
your wedding vows, is it?

25:38.560 --> 25:40.640
How many others have there been...

25:41.600 --> 25:43.840
since you slept with Peter Elliot?

25:46.600 --> 25:50.560
Twenty years you kept that from me.

25:51.960 --> 25:53.840
Twenty years!

25:56.600 --> 25:58.600
They were our friends.

26:00.240 --> 26:02.280
Our neighbors.

26:22.920 --> 26:27.040
[recording]<i> Bill... It's me again. Adam.</i>

26:28.520 --> 26:30.080
<i>After this, I'm done calling.</i>

26:30.160 --> 26:32.800
<i>If you don't want to talk to me,</i>
<i>I don't give a shit.</i>

26:32.880 --> 26:34.400
<i>But you need to know this.</i>

26:35.400 --> 26:37.840
<i>Grace is my wife now.</i>

26:38.800 --> 26:40.240
<i>She's my wife!</i>

26:41.560 --> 26:44.680
<i>I love her, she loves me,</i>
<i>and that's not...</i>

26:44.760 --> 26:47.200
<i>That's never going to change.</i>

26:47.280 --> 26:50.160
<i>-I don't care what you...</i>
-[Adam becomes increasingly upset]

26:51.280 --> 26:53.160
<i>How dare you?</i>

26:54.080 --> 26:57.520
<i>How fucking dare you?</i>
<i>On my wedding day!</i>

26:58.680 --> 27:02.760
<i>When we get back, you're going</i>
<i>to stay away from me and Grace.</i>

27:02.840 --> 27:05.720
<i>It's not like she's even your daughter,</i>
<i>is she?</i>

27:07.880 --> 27:10.040
<i>Does Dad know?</i>

27:10.120 --> 27:13.800
<i>Is that why he left?</i>
<i>Cos he was screwing your wife?</i>

27:13.880 --> 27:16.680
<i>Oh, I don't care anymore.</i>
<i>I don't wanna know.</i>

27:16.760 --> 27:19.440
<i>I don't wanna hear from you ever again!</i>

27:24.200 --> 27:25.440
Jesus.

27:26.560 --> 27:29.600
Adam and Grace
were brother and sister.

27:31.880 --> 27:34.360
Your dad and Moira Douglas...

27:46.080 --> 27:47.760
How did you find this?

27:47.840 --> 27:50.040
Bill's number was on Adam's phone bill.

27:50.120 --> 27:53.840
And, um, I didn't think anything
of it at first.

27:54.720 --> 27:58.800
We have these tapes at home of...

27:59.760 --> 28:03.880
the wedding day,
and... I saw this bit.

28:03.960 --> 28:05.760
I hadn't seen it before.

28:05.840 --> 28:07.800
Bill and Adam are arguing in it.

28:08.720 --> 28:12.320
Screaming at each other,
and Bill tells Adam he's going to hell.

28:13.840 --> 28:15.600
Sorry.

28:17.160 --> 28:20.360
I went to Bill about it this morning.

28:20.440 --> 28:25.760
I asked him, and he said that Adam
was having an affair.

28:28.160 --> 28:31.680
He... He lied to me.

28:35.040 --> 28:36.400
Is this...

28:37.960 --> 28:42.320
Could this have something to do with...

28:42.400 --> 28:45.080
what happened to Adam and Grace?

28:47.000 --> 28:49.480
Leave it with us.

28:49.560 --> 28:52.400
I think you need to go home
and be with your family.

28:52.480 --> 28:54.200
OK?

29:05.560 --> 29:08.400
Do you have the envelope you
found on Walsh's body?

29:14.320 --> 29:15.920
Has anyone else seen it?

29:16.000 --> 29:19.160
Just Mum and Anna.
It's been in my pocket the whole time.

29:22.480 --> 29:24.760
Uh... How do I tell them?

29:25.920 --> 29:27.720
My mum, my brother.

29:29.600 --> 29:33.480
We're going to look into this. I promise.
We're going to find out what went on.

29:34.560 --> 29:38.120
As soon as possible, which is
the point of me ringing you now, OK?

29:38.200 --> 29:41.160
We're pulling phone records
and bank statements for Bill Douglas

29:41.240 --> 29:45.160
for the past six months, putting together
a timeline of his movements.

29:45.240 --> 29:47.880
Good. While you're at it,
run that through the lab.

29:47.960 --> 29:49.880
An envelope? What am I looking for?

29:49.960 --> 29:52.640
Just run it through everything
they've got.

29:52.760 --> 29:54.720
Where are you off to?

29:56.840 --> 29:59.160
Just... Just something I need to do.

30:02.960 --> 30:05.560
Right.
Also, got something else for you now.

31:11.560 --> 31:14.600
-[bangs on bars]
-Keep it down in there!

31:14.680 --> 31:16.320
I'll talk!

31:20.280 --> 31:21.560
Change of plan.

31:21.640 --> 31:24.200
The surgeon's dates have shifted,
he needs us earlier, so...

31:24.280 --> 31:26.480
Good news. We're leaving tonight!

31:26.560 --> 31:28.680
-Tonight?
-So, better get packing.

31:28.760 --> 31:31.160
Yuki, thank you. Much appreciated.

31:31.240 --> 31:32.640
Yeah, of course.

31:33.680 --> 31:36.240
Send me an email, OK? Come on.

31:37.680 --> 31:39.160
I'll be fine.

31:40.040 --> 31:41.800
Back annoying you in no time.

31:45.000 --> 31:47.640
-Good luck.
-Oh, thanks.

31:50.520 --> 31:53.400
So, we better get packing.

31:53.480 --> 31:56.240
There's a flight leaving tonight.

31:56.320 --> 31:58.200
And, um, the operation?

31:58.280 --> 32:01.200
End of this week, probably.
Wasn't quite sure.

32:01.280 --> 32:03.440
The main thing is, we get there.

32:03.520 --> 32:07.640
But... we're paying him a lot of money.
How can he just change the dates around

32:07.720 --> 32:09.080
at the last minute?

32:09.160 --> 32:12.240
Look at it this way. We'll be in the sun
a lot sooner than we thought.

32:12.320 --> 32:15.760
But, Mum, it's so quick. It seems crazy
to be shifting it around so late.

32:15.840 --> 32:17.520
[Juliet] We have to go, now!

32:33.720 --> 32:35.640
It's OK. I'm sorry.

32:38.200 --> 32:40.200
Um, I know it's scary.

32:40.280 --> 32:44.400
And it's sudden, but...
this man says he can help.

32:44.480 --> 32:46.600
He's the only one that can operate.

32:49.400 --> 32:52.160
But... But what if he's wrong?

32:52.240 --> 32:55.240
What if he can't get it
out of my head?

32:55.320 --> 32:56.680
He's the best.

32:56.760 --> 33:00.440
He's the best there is
at exactly this kind of tumor.

33:01.880 --> 33:05.200
And... this was gonna be a surprise,
but...

33:06.400 --> 33:08.080
I booked the resort you found.

33:08.160 --> 33:09.920
The one with the three pools!

33:10.000 --> 33:12.840
What are we gonna do with three pools?

33:12.920 --> 33:15.240
Swim in them all, my darlin'.

33:15.880 --> 33:19.520
So... better get packing fast.

33:30.040 --> 33:32.120
That's the DNA results
from the envelope.

33:32.200 --> 33:33.520
Oh, cheers.

33:48.720 --> 33:50.320
Shit!

33:53.520 --> 33:55.120
Shit. Shit. Shit.

34:08.320 --> 34:11.880
Hiya. Fuller, listen. It's Andrew.

34:11.960 --> 34:14.679
You're gonna want to get round
to the Douglas residence.

34:16.159 --> 34:17.400
[door opens]

34:17.480 --> 34:18.920
[Claire] Mum.

34:22.320 --> 34:23.600
[Louise] Hmm?

34:29.800 --> 34:31.080
What?

34:34.159 --> 34:35.400
What is it?

34:43.320 --> 34:45.159
-[door opens]
-[Louise] Bill?

34:45.239 --> 34:47.080
-[door closes]
-[Louise] Bill?

34:49.360 --> 34:51.400
-Bill, what's going on?
-What do you mean?

34:51.480 --> 34:53.960
What the hell is going on?
I want you to tell me the truth.

34:54.040 --> 34:57.760
-Calm down, Louise.
-Claire has told me about the message.

34:57.840 --> 35:01.120
The message that Adam left
on your phone.

35:03.040 --> 35:05.600
-What are you talking about?
-What is this? What message?

35:05.680 --> 35:07.920
Bill told Adam...

35:10.120 --> 35:12.240
that he and Grace were...

35:15.720 --> 35:17.120
Were brother and sister.

35:17.200 --> 35:20.160
-[Bill] That's ridiculous.
-[Louise] Yes, it's ridiculous, isn't it?

35:20.240 --> 35:22.760
It's ridiculous, but he believed it.
So, why? Why?

35:22.840 --> 35:24.880
Why would you say such a thing?

35:24.960 --> 35:26.960
Louise. Louise, get out of my house!

35:27.040 --> 35:29.960
I'm not getting out of your house
until you give me an explanation.

35:30.040 --> 35:31.680
Get out of my house!

35:31.760 --> 35:34.200
-Please, both of you!
-Tell me why you said that to my son!

35:34.280 --> 35:35.920
-Explain yourself!
-[knocking at door]

35:36.000 --> 35:38.400
-[Bill] Get out!
-[Claire] This isn't helping!

35:38.480 --> 35:41.080
-[doorbell rings]
-Tell me why you said that to my son.

35:41.160 --> 35:43.320
[knocking at door]

35:43.400 --> 35:46.040
-Why would you say that to my son?
-Get out.

35:46.120 --> 35:49.080
-[door opens and closes]
-[footsteps approach]

35:54.920 --> 35:56.080
Bill.

35:58.080 --> 36:00.040
They've asked me to take you in.

36:02.160 --> 36:03.760
William Douglas,

36:03.840 --> 36:06.800
I'm detaining you under Section 14
of the Criminal Procedure Act

36:06.880 --> 36:10.360
on suspicion of conspiracy to murder
Adam and Grace Elliot.

36:10.440 --> 36:11.840
What?

36:14.840 --> 36:16.240
No.

36:16.320 --> 36:18.240
They have evidence, Bill.

36:18.320 --> 36:20.760
[Charlie] Claire found an envelope
on the victim's body.

36:20.840 --> 36:22.920
It had your fingerprints on it.

36:26.560 --> 36:27.760
I see.

36:29.240 --> 36:33.080
But... Th-Th-That... That's wrong!

36:35.440 --> 36:37.160
Say it's wrong, Bill!

36:40.320 --> 36:42.400
Say you didn't do it!

36:44.240 --> 36:46.360
Say you didn't kill our baby girl.

36:59.520 --> 37:03.200
I need a minute to put some clothes on,
Charlie. If that's alright?

37:03.280 --> 37:04.600
Of course.

37:59.240 --> 38:01.000
[sniffs]

38:03.160 --> 38:05.760
[sobs]

38:14.480 --> 38:16.920
[clattering]

39:49.200 --> 39:50.840
[Charlie] Bill, enough.

39:51.840 --> 39:53.480
Just put the gun down.

40:07.840 --> 40:09.720
You know what I was just thinking?

40:12.520 --> 40:14.480
If it wasn't for this illness...

40:16.920 --> 40:18.880
I wouldn't have known.

40:22.320 --> 40:24.160
None of this would've happened.

40:28.080 --> 40:32.120
If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't have had
Jamie and Gracie tested...

40:34.520 --> 40:37.400
and I wouldn't have found out
that Gracie wasn't mine.

40:41.120 --> 40:42.960
It ate away at me.

40:44.000 --> 40:45.720
You understand?

40:49.120 --> 40:52.120
I'd often wondered about you and Peter
in the past, but...

40:52.200 --> 40:54.080
I put it from me.

40:54.160 --> 40:56.200
I put it out of my mind.

40:57.280 --> 40:58.960
But now...

41:03.800 --> 41:06.600
It was easy enough to get a piece
of Adam's hair.

41:07.760 --> 41:09.720
Send it to the lab.

41:13.280 --> 41:15.760
I just wanted to forget, you know.

41:17.640 --> 41:19.440
I didn't want to know.

41:19.520 --> 41:22.960
I tried to move on, I tried to move
forward, but I couldn't!

41:23.040 --> 41:25.880
You know, that kind of thing,
it's like an infection.

41:25.960 --> 41:28.520
You just can't seem to shake it.

41:31.840 --> 41:34.200
Knowing that my wee Gracie...

41:37.160 --> 41:41.200
My wee baby was carrying a child
with her own brother.

41:44.000 --> 41:45.960
With her own brother, Moira.

41:47.440 --> 41:49.400
How could you?

41:50.760 --> 41:54.400
Because of you, Adam and Grace
would have been living in sin.

41:54.480 --> 41:56.200
[Louise] It wasn't her, Bill.

41:57.560 --> 41:59.120
It was you.

42:00.320 --> 42:02.200
Don't blame others
for what you've done.

42:03.560 --> 42:05.560
I tried to talk to him.

42:07.240 --> 42:09.080
You hear me, Louise?

42:10.080 --> 42:11.920
I tried to talk to him.

42:12.800 --> 42:14.640
I told him he was wrong.

42:16.680 --> 42:18.920
If only he'd listened.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.720
You're joking, right?

42:21.720 --> 42:24.080
-You can't be serious.
-It's no joke!

42:26.160 --> 42:29.520
What are you doing? This is bullshit!

42:29.600 --> 42:32.680
Don't take that attitude with me!
Do you hear me?

42:32.760 --> 42:36.880
OK. If you don't believe me, here.
Here, take it!

42:36.960 --> 42:38.880
Go on, take it!

42:44.800 --> 42:47.480
Carry on and you're going
straight to hell!

42:51.920 --> 42:53.680
[Bill]<i> They went on their honeymoon</i>
<i>anyway.</i>

42:55.240 --> 42:57.200
<i>He called me, again and again.</i>

42:58.400 --> 43:00.600
<i>He said it didn't matter.</i>
<i>He loved her.</i>

43:00.680 --> 43:02.760
<i>And nothing was going</i>
<i>to change that.</i>

43:05.120 --> 43:06.120
<i>Love.</i>

43:07.320 --> 43:10.680
<i>In whose name we all too often</i>
<i>do our worst.</i>

43:12.160 --> 43:14.960
<i>Can you imagine how that feels?</i>

43:15.040 --> 43:17.320
<i>To watch your little girl grow up.</i>

43:17.400 --> 43:23.360
<i>To love her more than life itself,</i>
<i>and for her to be... corrupted.</i>

43:23.440 --> 43:25.400
Hey, Gracie, it's me.

43:25.480 --> 43:28.840
Listen, I'm in Edinburgh
for a couple of days, you know.

43:28.920 --> 43:32.240
I was just wondering
if you wanted to meet up, you know?

43:32.320 --> 43:33.520
I need to...

43:34.440 --> 43:35.800
Oh. Oh, I see.

43:35.880 --> 43:37.480
How long for?

43:39.080 --> 43:41.960
No, no, no, no. It's alright. No, no.

43:42.040 --> 43:44.400
Ring me. Ring me when you get back.

43:44.480 --> 43:45.600
Ring me in a few days.

43:45.680 --> 43:48.120
It's alright. It's alright, love.

43:48.200 --> 43:50.200
OK. OK.

43:50.280 --> 43:52.200
Bye-bye. Bye.

43:52.280 --> 43:55.400
<i>She said she was out of town</i>
<i>for a few days.</i>

43:55.480 --> 43:57.560
<i>But now I know she was lying.</i>

43:57.640 --> 44:01.120
<i>She just...</i>
<i>didn't want to see her old man.</i>

44:01.200 --> 44:03.440
<i>Had her life to lead, you know.</i>

44:03.520 --> 44:07.120
<i>If she'd just been honest,</i>
<i>things would've been different.</i>

44:09.200 --> 44:11.200
I'll take that phone to start with!

44:12.640 --> 44:13.880
Come on!

44:13.960 --> 44:17.880
You come on!
You wanna stab me? C'mon!

44:17.960 --> 44:20.840
-Come on!
-C'mon, do it, if you're gonna do it!

44:20.920 --> 44:22.840
[grunting]

44:24.680 --> 44:27.480
Let go! Let go!

44:29.400 --> 44:31.240
How do you like that, huh?

44:31.320 --> 44:34.720
How do you like that? Huh?!

44:34.800 --> 44:37.360
You thought you'd rob
a drunken old man, uh?

44:37.440 --> 44:40.200
Well, I deal with bloody filthy animals
every day of the week.

44:40.280 --> 44:41.600
Do you hear me?!

44:41.680 --> 44:43.880
You're no different!

44:52.680 --> 44:54.200
Get out of it.

44:55.840 --> 44:58.160
[Lee coughs]

44:59.960 --> 45:02.080
[Bill]<i> I was desperate.</i>

45:03.120 --> 45:05.520
<i>I didn't see a way out. But I...</i>

45:05.600 --> 45:08.040
<i>I just knew it had to end.</i>
<i>It had to stop.</i>

45:10.040 --> 45:12.360
How would you like to make three grand?

45:15.200 --> 45:17.840
-What?
-I'm serious.

45:18.760 --> 45:20.240
Listen to me.

45:22.920 --> 45:25.200
How would you like to make three grand?

45:26.360 --> 45:29.320
-Are you serious?
-Yeah. Look, look.

45:30.120 --> 45:34.520
There's 1500 here. Fifteen hundred quid.

45:34.600 --> 45:37.560
I was going to buy supplies
with this tomorrow.

45:38.560 --> 45:40.600
But it's yours, do you hear me?

45:41.800 --> 45:43.840
There's a lad...

45:43.920 --> 45:47.000
There's a lad I know,
he's done a really bad thing.

45:47.080 --> 45:50.000
And he has to be stopped. For good.

45:50.080 --> 45:52.200
You hear me? Do you understand me?

45:52.280 --> 45:56.280
-No, man. I don't do that sorta thing.
-For five grand! Five! Five.

45:56.360 --> 45:57.760
Please.

45:58.320 --> 45:59.960
I know you need it.

46:01.720 --> 46:03.120
Please.

46:03.920 --> 46:05.240
[Lee] Yeah, OK.

46:06.800 --> 46:09.360
You'll get the rest
when it's done, alright?

46:09.440 --> 46:11.840
Now I'll meet you back here
next week.

46:13.440 --> 46:16.160
Same time, same place, alright?

46:17.840 --> 46:19.440
<i>Grace came home</i>
<i>the following night.</i>

46:25.400 --> 46:27.520
<i>She wasn't supposed to be there.</i>

46:27.600 --> 46:28.840
[gasps]

46:37.440 --> 46:40.440
<i>He must have seen pictures of me</i>
<i>with Adam and Grace in the flat.</i>

46:40.520 --> 46:44.480
<i>Must've looked around and found our</i>
<i>address somehow. And ended up here.</i>

46:46.480 --> 46:48.040
Push!

46:56.280 --> 46:59.680
<i>Maybe he wanted the rest</i>
<i>of the money, I don't know.</i>

47:08.760 --> 47:11.400
<i>I realized something,</i>
<i>in all the panic.</i>

47:11.480 --> 47:13.000
I need the bathroom.

47:13.080 --> 47:17.280
<i>I still had my knife in my pocket</i>
<i>from the night before.</i>

47:28.800 --> 47:31.640
<i>I wasn't thinking, I just didn't</i>
<i>know what to do with it.</i>

47:31.720 --> 47:34.840
<i>So I kept it.</i>
<i>So I knew where it was.</i>

47:34.920 --> 47:38.480
<i>And, I thought... just to be safe.</i>

47:43.360 --> 47:46.320
<i>Your boy Rob, he was so angry.</i>

47:47.520 --> 47:50.720
<i>I thought maybe if it all did come out,</i>

47:50.800 --> 47:53.640
<i>and people ended up finding out</i>
<i>what we did,</i>

47:53.720 --> 47:55.640
<i>maybe I'd have a way out.</i>

47:56.720 --> 47:58.680
<i>An escape.</i>

48:17.600 --> 48:19.160
<i>I just wanted them to stop</i>

48:19.240 --> 48:22.400
because it was ungodly!

48:24.400 --> 48:26.080
It was ungodly.

48:30.120 --> 48:32.480
She had a kind heart, our Gracie.

48:32.560 --> 48:34.600
She was an innocent.

48:37.040 --> 48:39.840
And I wanted her to stay
that way, Moira.

48:42.200 --> 48:45.880
I wanted her to stay that way.
That... That's all.

48:47.200 --> 48:49.400
The things we do...

48:51.120 --> 48:54.160
God in Heaven, the things we do...

48:55.640 --> 48:58.040
to protect the ones we love.

48:59.640 --> 49:01.640
To survive.

49:04.560 --> 49:07.240
-Bill. No.
-[Louise] Yes, do it! Do it.

49:07.320 --> 49:08.360
Go on, do it. Do it!

49:08.440 --> 49:09.920
-Mum! Mum!
-Do it!

49:10.000 --> 49:12.440
Do it! It'll be the first decent thing
you've done!

49:12.520 --> 49:15.840
Yes, it will be. My boy! My boy.

49:15.920 --> 49:19.280
Your daughter. And our grandchild!

49:19.360 --> 49:21.320
Go on, do it, Bill!

49:21.400 --> 49:24.920
Their blood is on your hands, Bill!
Pull the trigger! Pull it!

49:25.000 --> 49:27.480
-Mum!
-Pull it!

49:27.560 --> 49:31.240
[Louise] Pull it! Pull it! Pull it!

49:35.480 --> 49:37.920
It's not all my fault.

49:39.400 --> 49:40.600
[sobs]

49:41.440 --> 49:44.840
And I ca... I ca... I can't.

49:46.520 --> 49:48.240
I... I...

49:49.200 --> 49:51.320
I... I...

49:52.320 --> 49:55.640
I... I can't... I can't...

50:05.680 --> 50:07.320
You coward.

50:28.160 --> 50:31.360
-This is ridiculous.
-I'll be fine, Mum.

50:32.720 --> 50:34.840
Where did all this composure come from?

50:34.920 --> 50:36.960
Definitely not you!

50:40.720 --> 50:42.000
Juliet.

50:52.200 --> 50:56.640
Sweetheart, I'm just going to talk
to Andrew for a minute.

50:56.720 --> 50:58.920
But we're in the queue.

50:59.000 --> 51:01.520
-You keep our place.
-OK.

51:18.520 --> 51:20.960
How'd you find me?

51:21.040 --> 51:24.000
I knew you were booked
to go to Mumbai.

51:24.080 --> 51:28.120
I figured... that you'd decided
to go early.

51:30.080 --> 51:33.000
I never thought you were listening
when I talked about all this.

51:33.080 --> 51:35.120
Oh, yeah. I listen.

51:38.960 --> 51:41.400
I appreciate you keeping
the rest of the team outside.

51:41.480 --> 51:44.880
I need a minute to talk to Maddy
to try and explain.

51:46.040 --> 51:47.600
If that's alright?

51:48.600 --> 51:52.560
There is no team, Juliet. Just me.

51:55.720 --> 52:01.160
When I started in this job,
I had so much fire in me, you know?

52:01.240 --> 52:06.040
I thought putting bad people
away changed things.

52:07.040 --> 52:10.720
But over time, that way of thinking...

52:12.160 --> 52:13.880
It goes, you know?

52:15.040 --> 52:19.760
Seeing murderers who walk because
a search warrant's been overturned

52:19.840 --> 52:23.720
by some defense lawyer
trying to make a career.

52:23.800 --> 52:29.040
Seeing abusive husbands who might
get two months if you get lucky

52:29.120 --> 52:33.120
and then they're right back out beating
the crap out of their missus again.

52:34.400 --> 52:37.800
Seeing the same thing happening
again and again...

52:39.360 --> 52:42.920
You said I checked out a while back.
Maybe I did.

52:44.760 --> 52:48.080
Or maybe I just got tired of going
round in circles.

52:52.960 --> 52:56.840
I did it.
I took those drugs and sold them.

52:58.240 --> 53:00.800
Maddy needs this operation.

53:00.880 --> 53:04.680
-I did it to give her a chance.
-I figured that.

53:05.600 --> 53:07.600
That's why I'm here on my own.

53:09.760 --> 53:12.240
It's up to you what you do next.

53:20.960 --> 53:25.080
-It's not about me.
-It never is, is it?

53:32.160 --> 53:34.040
Good luck with the operation.

53:39.400 --> 53:40.800
Andrew...

53:40.880 --> 53:44.320
You'd better get going.
Don't want to miss your flight.

53:45.480 --> 53:48.040
Thank you. Thank you.

54:00.480 --> 54:02.840
-What was that all about?
-Nothing.

54:04.000 --> 54:06.080
Just saying goodbye.

54:20.800 --> 54:21.840
Hey.

54:24.000 --> 54:25.000
Hey.

54:33.160 --> 54:34.720
I...

54:36.120 --> 54:39.440
I tried to come and see you earlier
but I just couldn't.

54:39.520 --> 54:41.880
-I'm really sorry.
-And it's OK, it's OK. I get it.

54:42.760 --> 54:44.320
I get it.

54:46.840 --> 54:48.720
Why did you confess?

54:52.520 --> 54:54.400
I thought I was protecting you.

54:59.240 --> 55:01.000
What...

55:02.080 --> 55:04.560
What are we doing
if we can't trust each other?

55:06.200 --> 55:08.720
We were going to end it, weren't we?

55:09.960 --> 55:13.560
I mean, before everything
that happened to me, and...

55:14.600 --> 55:17.480
and you were there for me
and I needed you...

55:17.560 --> 55:19.960
And I couldn't have asked for more.

55:20.040 --> 55:24.200
But we...
We've been broken for a long time.

55:24.280 --> 55:28.960
Hmm. But I can, um...
I could try harder...

55:31.600 --> 55:33.520
Just let it go, Rob.

55:35.720 --> 55:38.160
I don't need protecting anymore.

55:54.960 --> 55:56.760
[knocking at door]

56:04.040 --> 56:06.640
You're bright and early this morning,
my love.

56:06.720 --> 56:08.400
[Claire] I couldn't really sleep.

56:08.480 --> 56:10.600
I was up all night, thinking...

56:12.400 --> 56:14.600
I...

56:14.680 --> 56:16.800
I can't, Meredith.

56:18.240 --> 56:20.240
I'm so sorry, I can't do it.

56:25.000 --> 56:27.160
I understand.

56:27.240 --> 56:29.880
It's nothing to do with right and wrong,

56:29.960 --> 56:32.920
it's nothing to do with getting caught,
even.

56:33.000 --> 56:35.600
Christ, I'll probably
be going to jail anyway.

56:35.680 --> 56:37.760
What do you mean?

56:37.840 --> 56:43.360
I mean, sometimes
you just have to do what's right for you.

56:43.440 --> 56:44.880
Despite what the world says.

56:46.400 --> 56:49.840
<i>We make choices.</i>
<i>And we have to live with them.</i>

56:55.320 --> 56:58.200
I didn't know. I didn't know.

57:00.360 --> 57:02.640
If I'd known...

57:02.720 --> 57:04.440
I'm so sorry.

57:10.960 --> 57:14.240
[Claire]<i> We have to choose</i>
<i>which way we go. What we do.</i>

57:14.320 --> 57:18.000
<i>And, dear God,</i>
<i>if we make the wrong choice...</i>

57:20.040 --> 57:21.720
<i>it can destroy us.</i>

57:21.800 --> 57:25.240
<i>Because everything we do has </i>
<i>consequences.</i>

57:29.560 --> 57:32.720
The truth is,
I just don't want you to go.

57:34.560 --> 57:37.200
It's selfish, I know.

57:39.640 --> 57:41.320
I'm sorry.

57:44.040 --> 57:45.840
Don't be, love.

57:47.600 --> 57:49.360
Don't be.

57:52.800 --> 57:54.080
Thank you.

57:59.240 --> 58:01.160
[Adam]<i> Hey, Gracie.</i>

58:01.240 --> 58:02.520
[Grace]<i> Yeah?</i>

58:03.680 --> 58:05.080
[Adam]<i> Can you keep a secret?</i>

58:05.160 --> 58:06.480
<i>What?</i>

58:06.560 --> 58:07.720
[Adam]<i> Hang on.</i>

58:12.080 --> 58:13.880
<i>W-Wait a second.</i>

58:17.040 --> 58:19.200
<i>-Don't laugh, yeah?</i>
<i>-Go on.</i>

58:20.760 --> 58:22.040
<i>I...</i>

58:22.120 --> 58:23.600
<i>I like you.</i>

58:24.680 --> 58:26.240
<i>Well, I like you too.</i>
