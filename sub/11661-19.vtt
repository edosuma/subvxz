(serene music playing)

01:05.633 --> 01:06.767
What an idiot.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.967
Of all the lame-brained,
moronic dopes.

01:09.033 --> 01:13.000
If ever I wanted to reach through
the phone and strangle somebody.

01:13.066 --> 01:15.834
Not a morning person,
are you, pussycat?

01:15.900 --> 01:20.233
It's this caterer that I hired for
my "Save the Wetlands" banquet.

01:20.300 --> 01:21.934
He's a week late with the menu.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.266
Now he tells me he's going to serve
wild duck and crayfish.

01:27.333 --> 01:29.100
They come from the Wetlands.

01:29.166 --> 01:31.433
It's like holding a
"save the whales" function

01:31.500 --> 01:33.300
on a Japanese trawler.

01:34.767 --> 01:37.700
Is there an open bar?

01:37.767 --> 01:40.300
You know, Ma,
that's part of the problem.

01:40.367 --> 01:41.734
Nobody cares.

01:41.800 --> 01:44.967
Do you realize what would happen
if there were no swamps?

01:45.033 --> 01:47.300
New Jersey wouldn't have
a state smell.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.433
I'm just in over my head,

01:51.500 --> 01:55.533
what with the banquet, press
releases, petitions to be signed.

01:55.600 --> 01:56.834
What am I going to do?

01:56.900 --> 01:58.233
I'll help.

01:58.300 --> 02:01.667
Oh, Blanche, that's sweet,
but, honey, aren't your hands tied

02:01.734 --> 02:04.600
with all the work
that you're doing for... you?

02:07.834 --> 02:10.266
I know I'm not always the first one
to volunteer,

02:10.333 --> 02:14.000
but I happen to have
an affection for bayous.

02:14.066 --> 02:18.066
As a matter of fact,
I became a woman in one.

02:18.133 --> 02:22.200
I thought you lost it
in a hot-air balloon.

02:22.266 --> 02:25.600
I thought you lost it
at a pancake breakfast.

02:25.667 --> 02:29.333
Well, those don't count.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.734
I mean, they did at the time,
but this is the definitive

02:32.800 --> 02:35.900
"where I lost my virginity" story.

02:35.967 --> 02:40.000
It's nice of you to share something
so personal with us, Blanche.

02:40.066 --> 02:41.266
In a bayou.

02:41.333 --> 02:43.433
You slut.

02:49.433 --> 02:52.433
-Mail call.
-Oh, Rose. You're here. That's good.

02:52.500 --> 02:55.934
I'm absolutely snowed under
with this Wetlands thing.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.266
As usual,
I know I can count on you.

02:58.333 --> 02:59.767
I'm sorry, Dorothy.

02:59.834 --> 03:03.400
But, Rose, you always
help out with these things.

03:03.467 --> 03:05.100
You're involved
in all the charities.

03:05.166 --> 03:09.433
You sent a contribution to
"Save the Rich."

03:09.500 --> 03:12.467
I have charity work burnout,
Dorothy.

03:12.533 --> 03:15.800
In the last three months,
I've helped with so many raffles

03:15.867 --> 03:17.900
and bake sales and car washes.

03:17.967 --> 03:19.533
I have to draw the line.

03:19.600 --> 03:22.300
Well, I guess I'll manage somehow.

03:24.567 --> 03:25.834
What is it, Rose?

03:25.900 --> 03:27.500
Is something wrong?

03:27.567 --> 03:28.700
I'm not sure.

03:28.767 --> 03:32.200
St. Luke's hospital wants me
to come in for some test.

03:32.266 --> 03:34.533
That's where I had
my gall bladder out.

03:34.600 --> 03:35.800
Can I see it?

03:35.867 --> 03:39.333
They throw organs out
after surgery.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.233
The letter, Rose.

03:42.300 --> 03:43.467
Oh.

03:45.734 --> 03:47.133
Mm-hmm.

03:47.200 --> 03:49.967
Seems you had a transfusion
while you were there.

03:50.033 --> 03:55.333
The hospital thinks the blood...
may have contained HIV antibodies.

03:55.400 --> 03:59.200
HI...V, wait a minute.

03:59.266 --> 04:01.166
You're talking about AIDS.

04:01.233 --> 04:03.734
This has to be some
kind of mistake.

04:03.800 --> 04:06.166
Don't panic.
It's just a possibility.

04:06.233 --> 04:08.367
-This is a precaution.
-What do I do?

04:08.433 --> 04:10.667
We call the hospital
for an appointment.

04:10.734 --> 04:11.900
Everything will be fine.

04:11.967 --> 04:13.967
-You think so?
-I'm sure of it.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.066
Now, let's plan
Dorothy's fundraiser.

04:17.133 --> 04:19.600
Hey. I know what would be fun.

04:19.667 --> 04:23.266
We're trying to raise
all the money in one night.

04:25.567 --> 04:27.567
I know.

04:30.834 --> 04:33.934
(mellow music playing)

04:34.000 --> 04:36.400
Yes, but this is a very important...

04:38.200 --> 04:42.200
yes, yes, I understand.
I understand.

04:42.266 --> 04:44.066
Oh, boy, some people.

04:44.133 --> 04:45.467
What's wrong, Blanche?

04:45.533 --> 04:48.900
Nobody gives a damn about
"Save the Wetlands."

04:48.967 --> 04:51.834
I sat in that booth at the mall
for three hours.

04:51.900 --> 04:54.667
Not one soul came by
and asked for information.

04:54.734 --> 04:57.033
What we need
is some swamp gimmick,

04:57.100 --> 05:01.667
like "guess how many
leeches are in the jar."

05:02.166 --> 05:04.367
I don't think so, Blanche.

05:04.433 --> 05:07.367
All right, then.
How about a celebrity auction?

05:07.433 --> 05:09.200
If you could buy
a celebrity at an auction,

05:09.266 --> 05:12.700
I'd be showering every
morning with Trini Lopez.

05:12.767 --> 05:16.367
Ma, I didn't know you liked
Trini Lopez.

05:16.433 --> 05:19.100
I don't, but who can
I afford on a fixed income?

05:20.500 --> 05:22.567
You don't understand, Sophia.

05:22.633 --> 05:26.700
A celebrity auction is where famous
people donate personal items

05:26.767 --> 05:28.333
to bid on for charities.

05:28.400 --> 05:31.200
That's a great idea,
but it's a little late.

05:31.266 --> 05:35.834
How are we going to find celebrities
to donate stuff and donate it fast?

05:35.900 --> 05:37.233
I'll pull some strings.

05:37.300 --> 05:39.533
It so happens I know
some famous people.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.533
Who?

05:40.600 --> 05:42.934
Well, I don't want
to divulge his name,

05:43.000 --> 05:45.266
but I'll give you a clue.

05:45.333 --> 05:49.066
I know what the "F" stands for
in William F. Buckley.

05:51.700 --> 05:53.867
Does someone want to drive me
to the hospital?

05:53.934 --> 05:55.934
Your appointment's
not for three hours.

05:56.000 --> 05:57.934
I'd like to get there early.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.200
If you won't take me,
I'll go without you.

06:00.266 --> 06:02.467
I might as well get used
to being alone.

06:02.533 --> 06:04.300
What does that mean?

06:04.367 --> 06:06.967
If that test turns out
to be positive,

06:07.033 --> 06:10.867
you won't want to be around me,
you or Miles or anybody.

06:10.934 --> 06:13.300
Now, that is not true,

06:13.367 --> 06:15.867
and I'm sure Miles
will feel the same way.

06:15.934 --> 06:17.000
How will I tell him?

06:17.066 --> 06:19.533
You don't have to tell him
anything now.

06:19.600 --> 06:21.367
You're just going for a test.

06:21.433 --> 06:23.834
It's not just <i>a </i>test, Dorothy.

06:23.900 --> 06:25.567
I know just how you feel.

06:25.633 --> 06:28.867
I remember how nervous
and panicked I was

06:28.934 --> 06:31.667
when I went to that neurologist
to have my memory tested.

06:31.734 --> 06:33.000
How did you handle it?

06:33.066 --> 06:35.300
Well, usually I add
a cup of bleach.

06:40.767 --> 06:44.533
(soft music playing)

06:48.667 --> 06:49.500
Can I help you?

06:49.567 --> 06:50.467
I think so.

06:50.533 --> 06:54.767
I have a 2 o'clock appointment
for an AIDS blood test.

06:54.834 --> 06:55.800
My name is...

06:57.166 --> 06:58.133
well, it's...

06:58.200 --> 06:59.934
You know,
we encourage anonymity,

07:00.000 --> 07:02.633
so you could give us
a fictitious name.

07:02.700 --> 07:04.500
Oh, that would be great.

07:05.834 --> 07:07.033
Dorothy Zbornak.

07:14.800 --> 07:16.033
Fine.

07:16.100 --> 07:19.033
We'll call you. You'll be seeing
a counselor and then the doctor.

07:19.100 --> 07:21.033
Meanwhile, take a seat, Ms...

07:21.100 --> 07:23.767
Zbornak. Dorothy Zbornak.

07:23.834 --> 07:26.266
-Z-B-O--
-Let's go, Dorothy.

07:30.867 --> 07:34.300
Boy, this is creepy.
I mean, fake names?

07:34.367 --> 07:36.000
Well, honey, it makes sense.

07:36.066 --> 07:40.033
People who test positive have
trouble getting insurance, jobs.

07:40.100 --> 07:41.133
It's terrible.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.266
Well, the whole process is terrible.

07:43.333 --> 07:44.600
I wish it were over.

07:44.667 --> 07:46.200
It will be soon.

07:46.266 --> 07:49.867
I haven't been
this scared since 1952

07:49.934 --> 07:53.934
when St. Olaf's most active
volcano threatened to erupt.

07:56.433 --> 07:58.400
Luckily, there were
some Druid priests

07:58.467 --> 08:01.834
who were in town for
the opening of Stonehengeland.

08:01.900 --> 08:04.200
They said they could stop it

08:04.266 --> 08:07.567
if they could sacrifice
the town's dumbest virgin.

08:10.500 --> 08:14.033
I don't know why I raised my hand.

08:17.900 --> 08:20.934
It must have been
the excitement of the moment.

08:21.033 --> 08:23.533
They said the only way
to prevent the eruption

08:23.600 --> 08:26.433
was for me to crawl through
their legs, up the volcano,

08:26.500 --> 08:28.900
while they gave me
my birthday whacks.

08:30.533 --> 08:33.400
Well, and you're not
going to believe this,

08:33.467 --> 08:38.066
it turns out they weren't
Druid priests at all.

08:38.133 --> 08:41.667
Just a bunch of Shriners
looking for a good time.

08:42.633 --> 08:45.066
That's a scary story, Rose.

08:46.033 --> 08:48.567
Why don't they call me? I want
to get this over and go home.

08:48.633 --> 08:52.233
Rose, come here, honey.
We need to talk.

08:52.300 --> 08:53.433
What, Blanche?

08:54.934 --> 08:57.233
This is something
I tend to keep to myself,

08:57.300 --> 08:58.800
but I want you to know.

08:58.867 --> 08:59.967
I got tested too.

09:00.033 --> 09:02.100
I know what you're going through.

09:02.166 --> 09:03.400
What did you do?

09:03.467 --> 09:04.800
I just had the test,

09:04.867 --> 09:07.000
and then I had
a long talk with myself

09:07.066 --> 09:09.533
about being with so many men.

09:09.600 --> 09:12.900
Now, when I'm with a man,
I know his complete history,

09:12.967 --> 09:16.266
and we take
the necessary precautions.

09:16.333 --> 09:20.033
I wanted you to know I understand
this is not an easy time.

09:20.100 --> 09:21.367
Oh, thank you, Blanche.

09:21.433 --> 09:22.900
Mrs. Zbornak?

09:22.967 --> 09:24.700
Dorothy Zbornak?

09:25.200 --> 09:26.900
Rose.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.834
Well, this is it.

09:28.900 --> 09:30.867
All right, darling.
I'll go with you.

09:36.100 --> 09:37.100
Dorothy.

09:37.166 --> 09:38.633
Ma, where have you been?

09:38.700 --> 09:40.767
I think it's nice
when you're in a hospital

09:40.834 --> 09:42.400
to walk around
and cheer people up.

09:42.467 --> 09:44.433
That's nice, Ma.

09:44.500 --> 09:47.400
So after I had my prescription
filled, I went up to geriatrics

09:47.467 --> 09:51.600
and sang "Anything you can do,
I can do better".

09:51.667 --> 09:53.200
Ma.

09:53.266 --> 09:55.867
What a tough crowd.
They threw Jell-o at me,

09:55.934 --> 09:58.800
if you can call that throwing.

09:58.867 --> 10:00.433
What are you reading?

10:00.500 --> 10:03.767
This pamphlet on
AIDS and teenagers.

10:03.834 --> 10:06.033
It's really so discouraging.

10:06.100 --> 10:09.600
Parents don't talk
to their kids about sex.

10:09.667 --> 10:10.767
This is so important,

10:10.834 --> 10:13.467
you'd think they could get past
their embarrassment.

10:13.533 --> 10:15.867
Thank God I was
a progressive parent.

10:15.934 --> 10:19.433
I was amazed at those technical
terms you used.

10:19.500 --> 10:22.533
You said never to let a boy touch me
you know where.

10:24.433 --> 10:26.333
And you spelled where.

10:27.633 --> 10:31.066
Maybe I used to be old-fashioned,
but times have changed.

10:31.133 --> 10:34.667
When I was at the pharmacy,
I bought you some condoms.

10:36.734 --> 10:40.834
Your boyfriends are supposed
to put them you know W-H-E-R-E.

10:44.533 --> 10:47.367
Ah, Rose, I wish I knew what
to say to make you feel better.

10:47.433 --> 10:49.667
Say I'm okay.

10:49.734 --> 10:52.200
You know, we always tend
to think the worst,

10:52.266 --> 10:54.200
so that when the news
does finally come,

10:54.266 --> 10:57.066
it's never as bad
as we thought it was gonna be.

10:59.667 --> 11:00.400
Well?

11:00.467 --> 11:04.567
Well, the good news is, you appear
to be in fine physical shape.

11:04.633 --> 11:06.633
Do you have any more questions?

11:06.700 --> 11:08.000
Of course.

11:08.066 --> 11:09.300
Do I have it?

11:09.367 --> 11:12.200
We'll have the results
in three days.

11:12.266 --> 11:14.900
Three days?
What are you talking about?

11:14.967 --> 11:18.333
I expect when I have
an AIDS test to find out.

11:18.400 --> 11:21.900
It takes us that long to be sure.

11:21.967 --> 11:23.000
I thought you knew.

11:23.066 --> 11:25.300
Well, I didn't know.

11:25.367 --> 11:28.333
First you give me that transfusion.
Now you tell me this.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.367
There's not much you can do.

11:30.433 --> 11:32.166
Well, sure there is.

11:32.233 --> 11:34.233
There's plenty I can do,

11:34.300 --> 11:38.367
like sit around the house
for the next 72 hours

11:38.433 --> 11:40.100
scared to death
he's going to tell me

11:40.166 --> 11:42.367
I have something
that's going to kill me.

11:42.433 --> 11:44.300
How am I going to do that?

11:44.367 --> 11:47.000
How will I get through
the next three days?

11:49.100 --> 11:50.066
Thank you.

11:52.433 --> 11:56.200
(calm music playing)

11:56.266 --> 11:58.967
What do you mean,
you're canceling?

12:00.867 --> 12:03.767
Is there anything I can say
to change your mind?

12:05.433 --> 12:06.934
I understand.

12:07.000 --> 12:07.900
Yeah.

12:07.967 --> 12:09.867
Goodbye.

12:09.934 --> 12:13.066
Now I don't have a band
for the banquet.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.166
What happened?

12:14.233 --> 12:18.633
They decided to play
at the "Free Noriega" benefit.

12:21.467 --> 12:24.834
-Hi, girls.
-What were you doing out so early?

12:24.900 --> 12:27.533
I couldn't sleep,
so I went for a spin.

12:27.600 --> 12:29.233
To Alabama.

12:29.734 --> 12:32.800
Do you know at
a truck stop in Tuscaloosa,

12:32.867 --> 12:34.900
they have an egg dish
named after you?

12:34.967 --> 12:36.100
Really?

12:36.166 --> 12:37.600
How are they prepared?

12:37.667 --> 12:39.867
Over easy.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.500
Rose, are you ok?

12:48.567 --> 12:50.900
I'm fine. Never better.

12:50.967 --> 12:52.633
In fact, I'm so fine,

12:52.700 --> 12:55.400
I've decided not
to even get my results.

12:55.467 --> 12:56.367
Now, Rose--

12:56.433 --> 13:00.533
Oh, look at all this stuff
for the celebrity auction.

13:00.600 --> 13:03.533
-Linda Evans' compact?
-Now, look, Rose--

13:03.600 --> 13:06.467
What about the dress Jamie Farr
promised from <i>M.A.S.H?</i>

13:06.533 --> 13:07.467
It hasn't come.

13:07.533 --> 13:08.367
He promised.

13:08.433 --> 13:10.667
We have other stuff. It's ok.

13:10.734 --> 13:12.367
No, it's not.

13:12.433 --> 13:14.967
He let you down.
Well, I'm not surprised.

13:15.033 --> 13:17.900
You couldn't trust Klinger
on guard duty either.

13:17.967 --> 13:19.967
Rose, take it easy.

13:20.033 --> 13:22.333
I'm supposed to take it easy

13:22.400 --> 13:26.166
when the Klingler's of the world
are kicking us in the teeth.

13:26.233 --> 13:29.166
-You're hysterical.
-I've seen this in the movies.

13:29.233 --> 13:32.100
How could he do this?
What's wrong with him?

13:38.433 --> 13:40.834
Ma, you almost got it.

13:40.900 --> 13:43.767
I think we're all under
a little stress.

13:43.834 --> 13:45.367
I have an idea.

13:45.433 --> 13:47.934
How about lunch and a movie?
My treat.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.400
Why not?
I have another 52 hours to kill.

13:53.734 --> 13:55.967
Oh, this is rough.
I feel terrible.

13:56.033 --> 13:57.767
Yeah. I really feel guilty.

13:57.834 --> 13:59.667
Jamie Farr's dress did come.

13:59.734 --> 14:01.066
I remembered where I put it.

14:01.133 --> 14:01.934
Where?

14:02.000 --> 14:03.200
How do I look?

14:07.200 --> 14:10.133
(serene music playing)

14:12.767 --> 14:16.200
What were you doing in my bathroom
for two hours?

14:16.266 --> 14:19.567
The hokey-pokey.
What do you think I was doing?

14:19.633 --> 14:21.367
Why were you using my bathroom?

14:21.433 --> 14:23.633
-There's something wrong with mine.
-What?

14:23.700 --> 14:25.300
Rose used it.

14:25.367 --> 14:27.767
Ma, that is just ignorant paranoia.

14:27.834 --> 14:28.867
Hey, I'm making progress.

14:28.934 --> 14:31.467
Yesterday I used the bathroom
down at the shell station.

14:33.133 --> 14:36.200
It's attitudes like that
that add to the panic about this.

14:36.266 --> 14:37.767
What's wrong with you?

14:37.834 --> 14:40.500
One little slip,
and you're all over my back.

14:40.567 --> 14:43.266
It won't happen again. Relax.

14:43.333 --> 14:46.367
Why is there an "R"
on some coffee cups?

14:46.433 --> 14:47.800
"R" for regular.

14:47.867 --> 14:49.533
Blank ones are decaf.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.066
I don't believe you.

14:51.133 --> 14:55.233
Look, I know intellectually
there's no way I can catch it,

14:55.300 --> 14:58.734
but now that it's so close to home,
it's scary.

14:58.800 --> 15:02.567
Well, Sophia, I'm afraid
you'll have to get over that.

15:02.633 --> 15:04.500
I'll try. I'll try.

15:04.567 --> 15:06.734
I'm usually not like this.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.533
I've been using
your toothbrush for months.

15:12.533 --> 15:16.600
(mellow music playing)

15:19.033 --> 15:22.000
Hi, Rose. What's going on?

15:22.066 --> 15:23.333
Oh, I'm sitting here

15:23.400 --> 15:26.967
kicking myself for not taking care
of my gall bladder

15:27.033 --> 15:29.567
and going to that hospital
for the operation

15:29.633 --> 15:32.800
and letting them give me blood
without asking,

15:32.867 --> 15:36.500
"are you sure this
won't kill me one day?"

15:36.567 --> 15:38.633
Now, now, Rose, take it easy.

15:38.700 --> 15:41.100
Why does everyone
keep saying that?

15:41.166 --> 15:44.367
I don't feel like taking it easy.

15:44.433 --> 15:48.367
I might have AIDS,
and it scares the hell out of me.

15:48.433 --> 15:52.567
Every time I talk about it, somebody
says, "there, there, take it easy."

15:52.633 --> 15:53.734
I'm sorry, honey.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.667
Why me, Blanche?

15:55.734 --> 16:00.433
I'm tired of pretending I feel ok
so you won't say, "take it easy."

16:00.500 --> 16:02.367
I'm tired of you saying,
"take it easy"

16:02.433 --> 16:05.467
'cause you're afraid
I'll fall apart.

16:05.533 --> 16:07.333
Damn it,
why is this happening to me?

16:07.400 --> 16:11.500
This isn't supposed to happen
to people like me.

16:11.567 --> 16:15.266
You must have gone to bed
with hundreds of men.

16:17.734 --> 16:20.333
All I had was one
innocent operation.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.800
Hey! Wait a minute.

16:22.867 --> 16:25.266
Are you saying
this should be me and not you?

16:25.333 --> 16:28.967
No. I'm just saying
that I'm a good person.

16:32.533 --> 16:35.300
Hell, I'm a goody-two-shoes.

16:35.367 --> 16:38.700
AIDS is not a bad person's
disease, Rose.

16:38.767 --> 16:41.934
It is not God punishing people
for their sins.

16:42.800 --> 16:43.800
You're right, Blanche.

16:43.867 --> 16:45.967
You're damn straight I'm right.

16:50.166 --> 16:51.000
I'm sorry I yelled.

16:51.066 --> 16:54.500
Oh, don't apologize.
This is what I want.

16:54.567 --> 16:57.133
Oh, God, this waiting
is driving me crazy.

16:57.200 --> 17:01.533
Blanche, when you were tested,
how did you make it through?

17:01.600 --> 17:05.767
Just kept it to myself and acted
like a real bitch to everybody else.

17:07.667 --> 17:10.600
No wonder we never knew.

17:15.133 --> 17:17.533
(calm music playing)

17:17.600 --> 17:19.934
These three days are killing Rose.

17:20.000 --> 17:22.667
What she needs from us
are calm heads.

17:22.734 --> 17:24.767
Then that's what she'll get.

17:24.834 --> 17:26.867
Oh, God, you gave me
an "R" cup.

17:27.367 --> 17:30.567
Ma, will you stop that? Here.

17:30.633 --> 17:33.433
Listen, we're the only family
Rose has here,

17:33.500 --> 17:36.700
so we have to help her through
whatever she's going through.

17:36.767 --> 17:37.633
Right.

17:37.700 --> 17:38.567
Sure.

17:38.633 --> 17:40.867
So... here's to Rose.

17:40.934 --> 17:44.266
Whatever happens,
whatever those tests show,

17:44.333 --> 17:45.500
we're here for her.

17:45.567 --> 17:47.367
Dorothy, give me that.

17:54.333 --> 17:57.800
(soft music playing)

18:06.967 --> 18:09.934
Oh, Rose, excuse me.
I didn't know you were out here.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.367
It's okay, Dorothy.
I was just praying.

18:12.433 --> 18:15.266
Trying to put in
a good word for tomorrow.

18:15.333 --> 18:16.633
What are you doing?

18:16.700 --> 18:21.200
Just working on this stupid flyer
for my stupid banquet.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.233
-It's not important.
-Sure it is.

18:23.300 --> 18:24.633
No, it's okay, Rose.

18:24.700 --> 18:27.400
No, it is important.
What's the matter?

18:27.467 --> 18:29.567
I've rewritten this
thing three times,

18:29.633 --> 18:32.533
and the most persuasive slogan
I can come up with is,

18:32.600 --> 18:35.700
"Save our swamps.
No, really, we mean it."

18:38.433 --> 18:40.200
-I like it.
-Oh, no, you don't.

18:40.266 --> 18:41.467
No, I don't.

18:41.533 --> 18:45.033
It sounds like I'm selling
mosquitoes, Rose.

18:45.100 --> 18:47.200
I mean, not that they don't
serve a purpose.

18:47.266 --> 18:49.133
All life is precious.

18:57.800 --> 19:00.100
I care about our Wetlands.

19:00.166 --> 19:03.200
I just wish they were more
glamorous, you know?

19:03.266 --> 19:04.667
I'm trying to save something

19:04.734 --> 19:07.633
that you can't go into
without wearing hip boots.

19:10.467 --> 19:12.000
Some people might chuckle,

19:12.066 --> 19:14.567
but I think what you're doing
is important.

19:14.633 --> 19:16.934
People laughed at me in St. Olaf

19:17.000 --> 19:21.200
when I spearheaded the drive
to get our very own missile silo.

19:23.266 --> 19:24.500
Oh, sure.

19:24.567 --> 19:28.834
Some gloomy guesses muttered
about the plutonium thing.

19:28.900 --> 19:31.800
But I figured if we could make
our sleepy little hamlet

19:31.867 --> 19:35.200
into a first strike target,
it would help tourism.

19:36.934 --> 19:41.200
You know, it sounds like
we both have trouble with groups.

19:41.266 --> 19:42.667
Maybe so.

19:42.734 --> 19:45.934
In school, I actually
joined the math club

19:46.000 --> 19:47.667
so I could meet guys.

19:48.166 --> 19:49.400
Really.

19:49.467 --> 19:51.100
Oh, I can beat that.

19:51.166 --> 19:54.333
I joined the 4-H club to be hip.

19:58.734 --> 20:01.233
The Aldo Ray fan club.

20:03.066 --> 20:05.834
-I can beat that too.
-What?

20:06.333 --> 20:09.433
No, I can't.
That's pretty bad.

20:12.967 --> 20:16.433
Oh, that felt good.

20:16.500 --> 20:20.066
-It's been a bad week.
-It'll get better.

20:22.000 --> 20:26.166
(serene music playing)

20:29.433 --> 20:30.867
It's weird.

20:30.934 --> 20:33.867
I wanted those three days over,
and now that they are,

20:33.934 --> 20:36.834
I kind of feel I'd like them back.

20:36.900 --> 20:39.367
Any second,
that door will open,

20:39.433 --> 20:41.667
and that doctor
will tell me my future.

20:41.734 --> 20:45.400
Your future's going to be filled
with joy and laughter.

20:45.467 --> 20:46.800
Thank you, Sophia.

20:46.867 --> 20:48.767
Don't thank me.
Thank the <i>Miami Herald.</i>

20:48.834 --> 20:50.867
It's your horoscope.

20:55.166 --> 20:58.633
-Good morning, ladies.
-Good morning.

20:58.700 --> 21:01.066
I hope you don't mind.
These are my friends.

21:01.133 --> 21:02.934
Not at all.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.567
Your test results were fine,
Mrs. Zbornak.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.800
Oh, that's great!

21:10.934 --> 21:14.200
That's great for you, Dorothy,
but what about me?

21:17.567 --> 21:18.533
Rose.

21:18.600 --> 21:21.600
Rose, you used my name.
You remember?

21:21.667 --> 21:23.367
Right.

21:23.433 --> 21:26.867
Well, then, I'm fine too...
I'm fine!

21:26.934 --> 21:29.133
Oh, thank you, God.

21:29.200 --> 21:31.300
I wish you could have
told me on the phone.

21:31.367 --> 21:33.633
The last hours waiting
were the hardest.

21:33.700 --> 21:36.033
But even people
who test negative

21:36.100 --> 21:37.533
often need more counseling.

21:37.600 --> 21:40.133
Oh, I feel wonderful. I feel great.

21:40.200 --> 21:43.433
Evidently you had all the emotional
support you needed.

21:43.500 --> 21:47.066
I know what you've been through, and
I'm very happy things turned out.

21:47.133 --> 21:49.266
Oh, thank you, doctor.

21:49.333 --> 21:51.066
-Thank you, doctor.
-Hey!

21:51.133 --> 21:53.467
Oh!

21:53.533 --> 21:55.567
Oh. Oh, he's right.

21:55.633 --> 21:58.066
You guys were terrific.

21:58.133 --> 21:59.934
Thank you for being there for me.

22:00.000 --> 22:02.767
Thank you for making me
feel you'd be there

22:02.834 --> 22:04.100
no matter what happened.

22:04.166 --> 22:06.100
Bet you'd like to get some rest.

22:06.166 --> 22:10.166
No! I haven't felt like I've been
living for the last three days.

22:10.233 --> 22:11.867
I want to go to the fundraiser.

22:11.934 --> 22:14.266
Great. It's going to be a success.

22:14.333 --> 22:19.200
Ma must have stuffed and
mailed over 500 invitations.

22:25.033 --> 22:26.467
Stuffed?

22:34.800 --> 22:38.500
(theme music playing)
