13:23.340 --> 13:24.910
Yeah, that girl.

13:25.300 --> 13:28.849
-Short hair. Super upset.
-Yes. Yeah.

13:29.430 --> 13:31.421
Do you remember what the call was about?

13:31.560 --> 13:33.926
I think it might have been,
like, a traffic thing.

13:35.100 --> 13:36.089
I can't remember.

13:37.270 --> 13:38.259
Can you try?

13:39.020 --> 13:41.102
Mmm. Sorry, man.

13:43.530 --> 13:44.770
Might have been stoned.

13:47.030 --> 13:49.521
-Thanks for your help.
-Anytime, my brother.

13:50.450 --> 13:51.690
I'm not your brother, dude.

13:58.460 --> 14:02.294
All he said is the district lavwers
asked for a meeting this afternoon.

14:02.380 --> 14:04.837
His guess is they want
to offer a settlement.

14:04.920 --> 14:07.002
-They want to make it go away.
-Well, of course,

14:07.260 --> 14:09.251
but we should hear them out,
maybe consider it.

14:09.430 --> 14:11.250
I'm not going to consider
letting the school cover up

14:11.350 --> 14:13.671
-what they did to our daughter.
-Doesn't have to be a cover-up.

14:14.020 --> 14:16.841
Dennis said settlements
often Include a statement,

14:16.930 --> 14:18.181
and remedial measures...

14:18.270 --> 14:19.897
What good will those do?

14:20.150 --> 14:21.686
They might help the next kid.

14:22.690 --> 14:24.567
We agreed that we were going
to fight this--

14:24.650 --> 14:25.526
[door opens]

14:26.570 --> 14:27.446
Hi there.

14:29.820 --> 14:30.900
Be right with you.

14:31.950 --> 14:32.939
[softly] Until the end.

14:33.030 --> 14:35.863
We can fight this until the end,
until it bankrupts us,

14:35.950 --> 14:37.781
when there's no guarantees we'll win.

14:38.040 --> 14:40.326
-We're not settling.
-I'm not saying we should.

14:40.420 --> 14:42.581
I just think we have
to think this through.

14:42.670 --> 14:44.490
What if we lose this lawsuit?

14:46.340 --> 14:50.253
Then the school walks away without
having to acknowledge they're wrong,

14:50.340 --> 14:52.592
without changing the way they do things.

14:54.350 --> 14:56.306
[whispers] We owe it to Hannah...

14:57.640 --> 14:59.221
to Hannah, to fight this.

15:00.980 --> 15:03.187
And we owe it
to the next kid to make sure...

15:03.940 --> 15:06.226
this doesn't happen again.

15:11.740 --> 15:12.866
How can I help you?

15:14.280 --> 15:15.781
Seriously, dude, that's bullshit.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.531
He got suspended for three days.
That shit goes on his record.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.782
Yeah, I don't really care.
At least we shut him up.

15:20.960 --> 15:23.246
They kept him out for three days.
I don't think we shut him up.

15:23.540 --> 15:25.451
You guys want to take him
on another ride?

15:26.000 --> 15:27.627
'Cause that worked so well.

15:27.710 --> 15:29.337
His credibility is shot.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.370
No one's gonna believe anything he says.

15:31.510 --> 15:34.638
Until he plays them the tape,
or until Tony does.

15:34.800 --> 15:36.051
Yeah, what happened there?

15:36.260 --> 15:37.841
I tried. Tony wouldn't budge.

15:37.970 --> 15:39.517
He's got the tapes hidden somewhere,

15:39.600 --> 15:41.932
and this medieval,
self-flagellating moral code.

15:42.600 --> 15:44.727
-We have to do this another way.
-It's back to Clay.

15:45.150 --> 15:48.142
If he's talking to Jessica
about her party, it may be too late.

15:48.360 --> 15:49.600
Why are we defending Bryce?

15:49.860 --> 15:52.101
Can someone tell me?
I mean, he's a rapist.

15:52.200 --> 15:53.519
Jesus, keep your voice down.

15:53.610 --> 15:55.487
I published a poem. He's a rapist.

15:55.580 --> 15:56.569
Stop using that word.

15:56.660 --> 15:57.649
[Alex] Why?

15:58.240 --> 15:59.571
What other word would you use?

15:59.830 --> 16:03.243
If Hannah's telling the truth,
but Jessica says she's not.

16:03.500 --> 16:05.957
Really, Courtney? That's still your
position? Hannah is lying?

16:06.210 --> 16:07.416
Come out, little girl.

16:07.500 --> 16:08.489
Shut up, Ryan!

16:08.590 --> 16:10.000
Okay, guys, look...

16:10.380 --> 16:14.259
Tapes go out, we all go down,
no matter what we did or didn't do.

16:14.340 --> 16:18.128
-Think people are gonna sort that out?
-Maybe not, but maybe Bryce goes to jail.

16:18.470 --> 16:21.098
Do you really think he would?
Do you seriously think that would happen?

16:21.180 --> 16:22.431
Maybe we should find out.

16:23.100 --> 16:24.146
I don't want to.

16:24.230 --> 16:25.219
No.

16:25.480 --> 16:27.892
We cannot let Clay
pass on those tapes, period.

16:28.230 --> 16:31.188
Or talk to Mr. Porter, which is why
I wanted to buy us more time.

16:31.320 --> 16:32.856
You kept him away from Porter,

16:32.950 --> 16:35.100
but we don't know
what he's gonna do on his day off.

16:36.490 --> 16:38.196
What are we doing after practice today?

16:38.280 --> 16:39.577
Talking about practice.

16:39.660 --> 16:41.366
[Sheri laughs] Always cheer.

16:42.830 --> 16:43.819
[Clay] Sheri.

16:46.170 --> 16:47.159
Do you have a minute?

16:48.590 --> 16:49.830
I'll catch up with you.

16:49.920 --> 16:51.126
-Okay.
-Bye, Sheri.

16:53.510 --> 16:54.670
Aren't you suspended?

16:54.760 --> 16:58.503
Yeah, so could we go somewhere
not in the courtyard to talk?

16:58.850 --> 17:00.841
I can't be late to first period.

17:00.930 --> 17:02.136
I just have a couple questions.

17:02.600 --> 17:03.476
[Justin yells]

17:08.860 --> 17:10.100
All right, let's go.

17:14.860 --> 17:16.407
-See you.
-See you. Justy!

17:16.990 --> 17:19.402
Coming to my place later? I'm...

17:19.490 --> 17:21.617
procuring fresh weed
from that sophomore kid.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.439
Nah, I can't. I can't.

17:23.540 --> 17:24.529
Well, I can.

17:24.620 --> 17:27.453
No, dude, you can't.
You've got recruiters coming.

17:27.710 --> 17:28.950
UCLA, Arizona.

17:29.040 --> 17:31.588
But that's all the more reason to relax.

17:31.670 --> 17:34.218
-You've been t_ense as hell.
-I'm fine.

17:34.550 --> 17:35.505
Hey, baby.

17:36.630 --> 17:38.586
Hope you're not
letting these two corrupt you.

17:38.680 --> 17:40.591
-Never.
-Good. That's my job.

17:40.760 --> 17:41.715
-Okay.
-Let's go.

17:42.310 --> 17:43.550
Where are we going?

17:43.680 --> 17:44.669
It's a surprise.

17:44.770 --> 17:48.092
No. I've got to talk to the guys.
Can we do this after third period?

17:48.190 --> 17:50.181
We can't do this after third.

17:50.610 --> 17:51.895
Hey, guys, do what?

17:52.280 --> 17:55.147
If Justin doesn't want to find out,
I should show someone else.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.229
Yeah, okay.

17:56.320 --> 17:57.651
Okay, let's go.

17:57.740 --> 17:59.446
Damn, man, give me a chance.

18:00.030 --> 18:01.076
Really?

18:01.740 --> 18:03.230
[Shen]
Are you gonna tell anyone?

18:03.410 --> 18:04.820
We have to tell somebody.

18:05.500 --> 18:07.570
-We have to do something.
-But it's over now.

18:07.670 --> 18:09.376
It's not over for his family.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.832
They still think he was driving drunk.

18:11.960 --> 18:13.621
He was driving drunk.

18:14.090 --> 18:16.661
For all we know, it wasn't the sign
that caused the problem.

18:16.760 --> 18:17.920
You know that?

18:18.930 --> 18:20.215
Or you just want to believe it?

18:21.260 --> 18:24.969
This is why I didn't want you
to listen to my tape. I didn't--

18:25.060 --> 18:26.379
You wanted to keep your secret.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.469
No.

18:28.190 --> 18:32.012
Because I didn't want you judging me
for the worst thing I've ever done.

18:33.110 --> 18:35.066
Other people, they know my secret.

18:37.530 --> 18:38.895
But you're different.

18:45.490 --> 18:47.117
-I'm going to the police station...
-C|ay.

18:47.200 --> 18:50.363
...to register for
a drug diversion program

18:50.960 --> 18:54.088
that I have to take because
your friends got me suspended.

18:54.250 --> 18:57.754
I didn't know anything about that.
I think it was terrible.

18:57.920 --> 18:58.909
Do you?

18:59.970 --> 19:01.130
Why don't you stop it?

19:01.800 --> 19:02.846
What can I do?

19:02.930 --> 19:04.170
His family,

19:04.260 --> 19:05.386
the man he hurt...

19:05.890 --> 19:07.676
they deserve to know
how it really happened.

19:07.770 --> 19:09.590
We don't know how it really happened!

19:09.690 --> 19:11.760
I mean, yes, the sign was down.

19:11.850 --> 19:14.648
-But he was driving drunk.
-He wasn't drunk.

19:14.730 --> 19:15.890
You know that?

19:15.980 --> 19:17.390
Or you want to believe it?

19:19.780 --> 19:21.987
I made the biggest mistake of my life.

19:23.780 --> 19:26.738
And I'm trying to keep it
from ruining my life.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.115
Do you get that?

19:29.960 --> 19:30.949
[bell rings]

19:34.340 --> 19:35.580
You should get to class.

19:36.340 --> 19:37.830
I'm trying to make it better.

19:38.380 --> 19:40.416
And I'm trying to make up for it.

19:42.590 --> 19:44.546
Will you just meet me after school?

19:45.100 --> 19:46.135
Why?

19:46.220 --> 19:47.630
So that I can show you,

19:47.890 --> 19:49.846
before you go tell the world what I did.

19:51.810 --> 19:53.937
Give me a chance to prove to you

19:54.020 --> 19:56.432
that I'm not like everyone else
on the tapes.

19:57.690 --> 19:58.850
Fine. I'll come.

19:59.820 --> 20:01.276
I'll text you the address.

20:04.820 --> 20:06.230
Are you gonna be okay today?

20:07.830 --> 20:09.286
Yeah. Fine.

20:18.300 --> 20:19.289
[whistle blows]

20:23.470 --> 20:24.459
Hey.

20:25.050 --> 20:26.130
You okay?

20:28.640 --> 20:30.016
Hey, Alex, I'm...

20:30.770 --> 20:31.759
fine.

20:33.440 --> 20:35.010
Can't believe this fucking school.

20:36.060 --> 20:38.608
They're already putting up
drunk driving posters.

20:39.650 --> 20:40.639
Whatever.

20:40.740 --> 20:41.638
Whatever?

20:41.820 --> 20:43.606
He was driving drunk. It was stupid.

20:43.860 --> 20:44.849
Yeah, but...

20:46.740 --> 20:47.980
I mean, aren't you sad?

20:49.030 --> 20:50.281
More pissed off.

20:52.160 --> 20:53.957
You know, I think you can be both.

20:55.920 --> 20:56.989
I mean, like...

20:58.000 --> 21:01.549
right now, maybe it's easier
being mad at him than being sad.

21:02.130 --> 21:03.666
That's cool. But...

21:04.010 --> 21:08.049
I also think that maybe
someday you might feel worse

21:08.140 --> 21:11.098
if all you were today was mad,
you know whatI mean?

21:13.100 --> 21:14.010
No.

21:15.980 --> 21:17.516
Sometimes you judge people...

21:18.310 --> 21:19.516
I mean, we all do.

21:20.190 --> 21:21.680
Sometimes you just...

21:22.440 --> 21:23.520
live to regret it.

21:25.490 --> 21:27.060
You don't know what you're talking about.

21:27.530 --> 21:29.111
Yeah, no, I probably don't.

21:29.280 --> 21:30.907
I usually don't, so...

21:32.830 --> 21:34.650
-I'm sorry.
-No, it's cool.

21:35.250 --> 21:36.239
You don't have to...

21:38.380 --> 21:39.449
leave or anything.

21:56.690 --> 21:58.760
[principal over P.A]
It takes a tragedy //ke this one,

21:58.850 --> 22:03.059
unfortunate/y, to remind us
how important it is to be safe. . .

22:04.610 --> 22:05.679
to be sober.. .

22:06.530 --> 22:08.191
and never drink and drive.

22:17.540 --> 22:18.916
[Hannah, crying] Clay?

22:21.460 --> 22:22.449
Can we...

22:22.550 --> 22:23.665
Can we talk?

22:25.380 --> 22:26.369
About what?

22:27.470 --> 22:28.755
About what happened.

22:32.510 --> 22:33.670
I need to tell you--

22:33.760 --> 22:35.921
What are you crying about?
You barely knew him.

22:37.390 --> 22:38.266
No.

22:39.140 --> 22:40.437
Clay, you don't understand.

22:40.520 --> 22:41.509
I do understand.

22:41.610 --> 22:43.817
Every drama has to be your drama,
or it doesn't count.

22:44.070 --> 22:46.231
Somehow this is all about you.
It's incredible.

22:46.740 --> 22:49.140
-No, Clay!
-Please, just don't, okay?

22:52.030 --> 22:53.019
[door opens]

23:00.620 --> 23:01.746
Shen.

23:02.250 --> 23:03.239
Sheri, stop.

23:03.340 --> 23:04.796
I don't want to talk about it.

23:05.710 --> 23:07.257
It was our intersection.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.676
The accident happened
at the same intersection.

23:09.760 --> 23:11.500
I said I don't want to talk about it.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.631
I thought you called about the stop sign.

23:14.720 --> 23:17.018
We don't know that's what caused it.

23:17.100 --> 23:18.340
We don't know it didn't!

23:18.980 --> 23:20.891
-Hannah--
-Sheri, Jeff is...

23:23.900 --> 23:24.889
You two okay?

23:25.900 --> 23:27.276
Yeah, we're okay, Mr. Porter.

23:27.690 --> 23:30.147
I mean, considering what happened.

23:30.530 --> 23:32.862
All right. Hannah,
how are you holding up?

23:34.950 --> 23:35.939
I'll be okay.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.029
Okay.

23:37.290 --> 23:39.861
If anything changes and you need to talk,

23:39.960 --> 23:41.029
my door is open.

23:47.760 --> 23:48.909
Keep your mouth shut.

23:49.550 --> 23:52.883
You speak of this to anyone,
and we both pay the price.

23:55.550 --> 23:57.461
And it's probably best if...

23:58.140 --> 24:00.222
we just stay away from each other.

24:12.150 --> 24:13.560
[Hannah]
I just needed to be alone.

24:15.950 --> 24:18.441
This was starting to be more
than I could live with.

25:08.000 --> 25:09.797
Wait. What about drama?

25:10.000 --> 25:11.160
No more drama.

25:11.710 --> 25:12.540
All good.

25:12.630 --> 25:15.372
[laughs] No, drama class.

25:16.260 --> 25:17.887
You're thinking about drama class?

25:18.050 --> 25:21.634
If they walk in during first period,
it's going to be awkward, no?

25:22.020 --> 25:24.227
We'll tell them we're
rehearsmg a love scene.

25:24.390 --> 25:25.550
They're theater nerds.

25:25.640 --> 25:27.938
It would help them to know
what actual sex looks like.

25:32.230 --> 25:33.811
All right, we should go,

25:33.900 --> 25:34.889
we should go.

25:34.990 --> 25:36.651
I should show my face in first period.

25:36.950 --> 25:38.736
You're just scared we'll be caught.

25:39.830 --> 25:40.728
No.

25:41.080 --> 25:42.650
Yeah. You are.

25:47.790 --> 25:49.781
But if they can't see us,
we can't be caught.

25:51.300 --> 25:52.335
Come on.

26:01.010 --> 26:02.466
Where's the fucking switch?

26:13.110 --> 26:14.179
Here's the switch.

26:14.280 --> 26:16.396
-Hey, Jess, what the fuck?
-[laughing]

26:16.530 --> 26:18.100
Let's see who can break it first.

26:18.740 --> 26:21.197
Like, break the light bulb?
What are you, six?

26:21.280 --> 26:23.032
It's just a stupid light bulb.

26:24.450 --> 26:26.077
What the fuck is wrong with you?

26:26.160 --> 26:28.162
When did you become such a pussy?

26:29.080 --> 26:29.910
Hey!

26:30.500 --> 26:32.957
-Hey, why are you acting crazy?
-Why aren't you?

26:33.170 --> 26:34.296
Cut it the fuck out.

26:35.510 --> 26:37.080
-Throw it back.
-Jess, stop.

26:37.170 --> 26:39.377
Jess, what is happening with you?

26:39.470 --> 26:41.381
Nothing. Nothing's happening, right?

26:42.890 --> 26:43.879
Fuck this.

26:45.680 --> 26:46.590
I'm out.

26:47.810 --> 26:48.879
Bye!

26:53.150 --> 26:54.139
[shrieks]

26:56.070 --> 26:57.059
Shit.

27:05.950 --> 27:07.577
Hey, I saw you talking to Clay.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.149
What?

27:09.250 --> 27:10.490
How did you even see that?

27:10.920 --> 27:11.784
Long lenses.

27:11.880 --> 27:13.086
Is he turning you in?

27:13.170 --> 27:15.661
-We shouldn't be talking about this.
-Is he turning you in?

27:16.210 --> 27:17.416
He didn't say.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.414
You like Clay, don't you?

27:19.510 --> 27:21.466
Of course I do. I always have.

27:21.550 --> 27:23.006
I always liked him too.

27:23.100 --> 27:24.749
He was always nice to me before.

27:24.850 --> 27:26.386
Tyler, what do you want?

27:27.720 --> 27:29.597
Let's talk to him. You and me.

27:29.850 --> 27:32.728
The other kids want to bring him down,
but we could talk to him.

27:32.810 --> 27:33.799
He might listen to us.

27:34.400 --> 27:36.220
Sheri, is this freak bothering you?

27:37.690 --> 27:39.772
-No.
-No, Monty, he's fine.

27:39.950 --> 27:41.486
Just think about it, please.

27:42.610 --> 27:44.191
-I gotta get to class.
-Wait, Sheri.

27:44.280 --> 27:45.736
No, you leave her alone, freak.

27:46.290 --> 27:47.325
Got it?

27:48.830 --> 27:50.650
Fucking leave her alone.

27:50.750 --> 27:52.411
These are thousand dollar cameras.

27:52.500 --> 27:54.127
I'll break 'em on your face.

27:54.210 --> 27:56.542
Jesus, Montgomery, leave him alone.

27:57.670 --> 27:59.752
-You want to go again?
-Do you?

27:59.920 --> 28:01.672
Didn't you just get back from suspension?

28:03.390 --> 28:04.379
Fuck you, Alex.

28:04.640 --> 28:07.211
No thanks, Monty,
you're not man enough.

28:08.970 --> 28:09.971
Okay.

28:16.980 --> 28:18.641
I suppose you expect me to thank you.

28:19.030 --> 28:21.237
Actually I'd like it
if you never spoke to me again.

28:34.960 --> 28:35.949
[taPSI

28:36.040 --> 28:37.166
Jesus!

28:37.340 --> 28:39.205
Fuck! Jess!

28:41.260 --> 28:42.545
The fuck?

28:42.630 --> 28:44.837
You can't sneak up on a guy like that.

28:44.930 --> 28:46.750
I didn't know that kid was a dealer.

28:46.850 --> 28:47.839
Yeah, as a sideline.

28:48.760 --> 28:50.307
My usual guy does house calls,

28:50.390 --> 28:52.381
but I gave my last bag
to Marcus yesterday.

28:53.230 --> 28:55.016
Is that bag for now or later?

28:56.060 --> 28:57.266
Shit.

28:57.860 --> 28:59.509
So you're a stoner now too?

29:00.110 --> 29:02.237
What is it with the best
and the brightest?

29:02.570 --> 29:04.811
Are you looking to have some fun, or what?

29:05.910 --> 29:07.195
Where's your boyfriend?

29:07.780 --> 29:08.769
Practice.

29:08.870 --> 29:10.110
We can meet up with him after.

29:10.200 --> 29:12.361
-Why aren't you at practice?
-I'm still benched.

29:12.450 --> 29:14.532
Seriously? That's fucked up.

29:14.620 --> 29:16.247
This school is fucked up.

29:16.380 --> 29:18.416
[chuckles] Don't disagree.

29:18.920 --> 29:20.410
So, are we gonna smoke or what?

29:21.090 --> 29:22.830
In the parking lot? Are you insane?

29:23.920 --> 29:24.921
Maybe a little.

29:26.680 --> 29:28.170
We can go back to my place.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.386
My folks won't be home for a few hours.

29:30.680 --> 29:32.090
Or we can go back to mine.

29:32.770 --> 29:34.419
Mine won't be home for a couple of days.

29:36.230 --> 29:38.437
You're not gonna get me
in trouble, are you, Jess?

29:38.900 --> 29:39.935
Maybe a little.

29:40.520 --> 29:41.600
Maybe a little.

29:44.610 --> 29:48.444
The district feels the settlement
is in the best interest of both parties.

29:48.530 --> 29:50.111
Then why isn't the district here?

29:50.740 --> 29:53.868
I think they felt this would be
a preliminary discussion,

29:53.950 --> 29:56.032
and once we got to finalizing terms--

29:56.120 --> 29:57.246
Which we won't.

29:57.500 --> 29:58.660
The offer's an insult.

29:58.750 --> 30:01.548
Two hundred thousand dollars
for the loss of a child,

30:01.670 --> 30:03.297
for the suffering of her parents?

30:03.380 --> 30:06.588
We can all agree no amount of money
can equal Hannah's life,

30:06.680 --> 30:09.638
but it is an attempt to further healing.

30:09.720 --> 30:13.463
And to be frank, it's more than
a public school district can afford.

30:13.560 --> 30:16.267
That's not our concern.
They have Insurance.

30:16.350 --> 30:18.261
The district is self-insured.

30:18.350 --> 30:20.432
Every dollar spent here
comes out of the classroom.

30:20.610 --> 30:22.100
You and I both know that's bullshit.

30:22.190 --> 30:24.067
Tell them to fire a few administrators.

30:24.820 --> 30:25.980
Starting with Gary Bolan.

30:26.190 --> 30:28.602
I don't think that's within
the scope of the agreement.

30:28.700 --> 30:30.019
Let's start with the NDA.

30:30.490 --> 30:32.367
-Standard.
-It's a non-starter.

30:33.580 --> 30:35.286
I don't know how far we get without it.

30:35.870 --> 30:37.110
You want to keep this quiet.

30:38.870 --> 30:41.532
You want Hannah's story hidden away.

30:42.710 --> 30:46.043
The district will continue
Its anti-bullying efforts

30:46.920 --> 30:49.627
_ and will commit
to a SUICIde prevention program

30:49.720 --> 30:52.928
to be in place by the beginning
of the following school year.

30:53.010 --> 30:53.999
Why...

30:54.430 --> 30:56.011
Why wasn't it in place already?

30:56.560 --> 30:58.551
There was a policy in place.

30:59.060 --> 31:00.266
There will be a better one.

31:00.350 --> 31:02.306
[scoffs] Well, that's nice.

31:02.810 --> 31:07.235
We all want to ensure that this
doesn't happen to another Child,

31:07.570 --> 31:08.776
penod.

31:09.070 --> 31:13.074
The financial means of the district
will affect its ability to assure that.

31:13.410 --> 31:14.650
Well, that's cold thinking.

31:15.330 --> 31:18.151
We all want a solution _
that's faIr to everyone, Dennis.

31:19.410 --> 31:20.570
[toilet flushes]

31:32.970 --> 31:34.176
I know your son.

31:35.720 --> 31:37.551
-I'm sorry?
-C|ay.

31:37.890 --> 31:39.881
He visited the house.

31:40.770 --> 31:42.180
And the store.

31:43.310 --> 31:45.141
He's the one who gave us the magazine.

31:49.610 --> 31:50.440
I see.

31:51.410 --> 31:53.150
We PFObably shouldn't be speaking--

31:53.240 --> 31:55.447
He was close with Hannah.

31:56.700 --> 31:57.735
Did you know that?

31:59.370 --> 32:00.359
He, um...

32:01.160 --> 32:02.536
He told me that, yes.

32:03.630 --> 32:04.915
He misses her very much.

32:06.210 --> 32:07.495
That's nice.

32:08.670 --> 32:10.160
He seems like a good kid.

32:11.430 --> 32:12.829
He's a very good kid, yeah.

32:13.430 --> 32:17.639
Tell me, how much
is his life worth to you?

32:18.770 --> 32:21.136
Mrs. Baker,
we shouldn't be having this conversation.

32:21.310 --> 32:23.346
Don't you think it's exactly

32:23.440 --> 32:25.977
the conversation that we should be having?

32:31.860 --> 32:33.771
My son is worth everything to me,

32:33.860 --> 32:36.021
as I'm sure Hannah is to you.

32:37.080 --> 32:39.366
And ifI lost him...

32:40.080 --> 32:41.866
felt someone had taken him from me,

32:41.960 --> 32:44.167
I would pursue any remedy possible.

32:44.330 --> 32:45.490
Yes.

32:45.750 --> 32:48.457
But I don't know any amount
of money would suffice.

32:49.170 --> 32:51.331
Would you settle for, say...

32:53.010 --> 32:54.887
two hundred thousand dollars?

32:56.890 --> 32:58.846
I think I would only
settle for the truth...

33:00.140 --> 33:01.380
whether I liked it or not.

33:13.820 --> 33:15.026
What the hell?

33:24.830 --> 33:25.910
No way.

33:45.390 --> 33:46.800
[knocking at door]

33:48.310 --> 33:51.393
[panting] Were you just on the phone
with your husband?

33:51.820 --> 33:52.809
Who are you?

33:52.900 --> 33:54.982
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

33:55.070 --> 33:56.606
My name is Clay.

33:57.030 --> 33:58.520
Well, what happened?

33:59.700 --> 34:01.019
Your husband was in an accident.

34:01.120 --> 34:04.192
He's alive. The paramedics said
an officer would come tell you,

34:04.290 --> 34:07.532
but your husband wanted you
to know right away, so I came.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.581
Was anyone else hurt?

34:12.300 --> 34:13.870
-Yes.
-Oh, Lord.

34:14.210 --> 34:15.336
[knocking at door]

34:16.050 --> 34:17.085
Yes?

34:18.180 --> 34:19.499
Hi, um...

34:20.800 --> 34:22.882
Mrs. Cantrell,
I don't know if you remember me.

34:23.180 --> 34:25.011
Clay, of course!

34:25.560 --> 34:26.936
From the night of the accident.

34:27.020 --> 34:28.226
Of course!

34:28.310 --> 34:30.858
Sheri said a Clay would be dropping by.

34:31.110 --> 34:32.316
What?

34:32.400 --> 34:35.187
Hey, look who's here!
He knows Sheri, did you know that?

34:35.780 --> 34:38.271
Clay! Hello, how are you!

34:38.490 --> 34:39.855
Hi, Mr. Cantrell.

34:40.450 --> 34:41.439
Hey, Sheri.

34:42.200 --> 34:43.189
Hey, Clay.

34:43.370 --> 34:45.190
Let me help you to your chair.

34:45.290 --> 34:46.655
I can do it. I can do it.

34:48.540 --> 34:50.917
I just love that you know each other.
Come on in.

34:53.710 --> 34:55.120
She's our little angel.

34:56.300 --> 34:58.291
What a small world!

34:59.510 --> 35:00.579
It really is.

35:04.930 --> 35:07.558
The first time I came here,
I tried to tell them.

35:08.310 --> 35:10.892
I stood on the front porch and I just...

35:10.980 --> 35:12.550
I couldn't get a word out.

35:13.320 --> 35:15.641
I remember Miss Cantrell saying,

35:15.730 --> 35:17.812
"Well, don't just stand there, come in."

35:19.990 --> 35:23.062
The next time I stopped by,
they invited me for dinner.

35:23.950 --> 35:26.578
The next time after that,
I helped hang pictures,

35:26.660 --> 35:28.958
and now I just spend time with them,

35:29.040 --> 35:30.359
help around the house.

35:31.670 --> 35:33.126
They seem to like you.

35:33.210 --> 35:34.450
Yeah, they're cute.

35:35.000 --> 35:36.706
They remind me of my grandparents.

35:39.130 --> 35:40.586
But they don't know the truth.

35:41.130 --> 35:43.132
You didn't tell them about the accident.

35:43.220 --> 35:44.539
What good would that do?

35:44.640 --> 35:47.097
Mrs. Cantrell says
he still has nightmares about it.

35:47.470 --> 35:48.880
What about the other family?

35:48.980 --> 35:50.015
Look, I can't. I...

35:50.640 --> 35:51.800
Ijust...

35:51.900 --> 35:53.299
I can't face them.

35:53.400 --> 35:54.685
And what they might do?

35:54.770 --> 35:56.897
Look, I will tell them. I will.

35:57.320 --> 35:58.730
Someday.

35:58.820 --> 36:00.697
You have to tell them now.

36:00.780 --> 36:03.021
-Like, today.
-Why now? Why today?

36:03.110 --> 36:05.021
-Because every day hurts.
-How do you know?

36:05.120 --> 36:08.442
Every day they live not knowing the truth.
They need this, Sheri.

36:08.540 --> 36:10.656
-They do, or you do?
-They're hurting.

36:10.960 --> 36:12.825
How do you know that?
Did you go see them?

36:12.920 --> 36:14.160
That's not the point.

36:15.500 --> 36:17.047
You can't keep this secret anymore.

36:17.460 --> 36:20.213
It's my secret, not yours.

36:28.770 --> 36:30.635
-Am I high?
-What?

36:30.730 --> 36:31.719
Ithink I'm high.

36:31.810 --> 36:33.220
Jess, you had two hits.

36:33.310 --> 36:34.299
Two is a lot!

36:34.400 --> 36:36.220
Well, it's more than one.

36:41.030 --> 36:42.236
What's in the safe?

36:42.320 --> 36:45.653
If my dad knew I can get into this,
he would flip his shit.

36:47.910 --> 36:48.945
Shit!

36:49.040 --> 36:50.359
I know, right?

36:50.450 --> 36:51.997
Dad's packing.

36:52.080 --> 36:53.240
-This one's my favorite.
-Jesus. Fuck.

36:53.330 --> 36:54.786
Jess, is that thing loaded?

36:54.870 --> 36:55.871
Of course not.

36:57.210 --> 36:58.666
Shit.

36:59.090 --> 37:00.876
I guess it was loaded. My bad.

37:00.960 --> 37:02.120
[laughs]

37:03.130 --> 37:05.212
You should not be handling a gun.

37:05.300 --> 37:06.756
I know what I'm doing!

37:07.050 --> 37:08.460
This is a Glock 19.

37:08.560 --> 37:10.710
Holds up to 15 rounds. Single action.

37:10.810 --> 37:12.971
Perfect for self-defense.

37:13.060 --> 37:14.800
Cool, I'll take your word for it.

37:15.100 --> 37:17.307
What, don't you like a Glock?

37:17.900 --> 37:20.061
I'm not really from a gun family, okay?

37:20.860 --> 37:21.895
We ski.

37:22.780 --> 37:23.769
Try it.

37:24.280 --> 37:25.406
I'm good.

37:25.860 --> 37:28.613
Is there a KFC around,
because I smell chicken.

37:28.910 --> 37:30.150
Fuck you.

37:36.120 --> 37:37.121
Take it.

37:37.210 --> 37:38.199
Fine.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.159
Yeah, so just like...

37:43.880 --> 37:46.041
Only actors in Hollywood hold it that way.

37:46.840 --> 37:48.080
Yeah. Right.

37:48.220 --> 37:49.175
Here, let me show you.

37:49.260 --> 37:50.716
-Twist that.
-Mm-hmm.

37:50.810 --> 37:51.879
Take this hand.

37:54.640 --> 37:56.688
So, just relax. Shoulders back.

37:58.650 --> 37:59.639
Breathe in.

38:02.070 --> 38:02.968
Breathe out.

38:07.410 --> 38:08.559
Then you shoot.

38:11.950 --> 38:12.939

38:14.000 --> 38:16.400
Clay, we're just so glad
to finally meet you.

38:16.920 --> 38:19.627
Jeff was so fond of you.
You helped him so much with his grades.

38:21.170 --> 38:22.956
It kept him playing ball,
as a matter of fact.

38:25.050 --> 38:28.258
Well, he did that himself. Ijust, um...

38:29.430 --> 38:33.252
helped him with punctuation
and word choice and stuff like that.

38:34.060 --> 38:35.766
You know, research techniques and...

38:36.770 --> 38:38.931
Well, we sure are grateful.

38:39.690 --> 38:41.260
You were a good friend to him.

38:43.860 --> 38:46.272
How come we haven't met you before
if you're such a good friend?

38:46.740 --> 38:47.775
Harris.

38:48.240 --> 38:49.229
No, it's okay.

38:50.700 --> 38:52.486
Um, I'm fine. Thanks.

38:55.700 --> 38:56.906
Jeff and I...

38:58.160 --> 39:00.537
we were just friends at school, I guess.

39:01.580 --> 39:05.038
But he was older than me,
and on the baseball team and everything,

39:05.130 --> 39:06.916
and I wasn't really anybody.

39:07.550 --> 39:08.756
Well...

39:09.260 --> 39:10.329
you were to him.

39:12.100 --> 39:13.089
Yeah.

39:15.350 --> 39:16.635
He was really nice to me.

39:18.640 --> 39:21.188
So, Clay, what brings you here?

39:23.230 --> 39:24.766
Well, I, uh...

39:25.150 --> 39:29.143
I was hoping another friend of Jeff's
would be here with me, but she, uh...

39:30.490 --> 39:31.525
She couldn't come.

39:33.910 --> 39:34.945
Okay.

39:37.700 --> 39:40.919
There's something you should know
about the night of the accident.

39:42.500 --> 39:43.706
What about it?

39:46.210 --> 39:47.700
[panﬁng]

39:50.720 --> 39:52.176
I was the ﬁrst person to get there.

39:54.760 --> 39:56.591
I was walking home...

39:57.270 --> 39:59.386
and I heard the crash.

40:12.780 --> 40:13.860
I found Jeff

40:17.410 --> 40:18.479
Ifound him.

40:20.620 --> 40:21.826
Jeff!

40:21.920 --> 40:23.535
Oh, my God. Jeff, can you hear me?

40:23.630 --> 40:25.586
Wait. Hold on, Jeff, hold on!

40:25.790 --> 40:28.293
I thought maybe I'd try CPR.

40:29.260 --> 40:31.000
Something. I don't know.

40:31.420 --> 40:32.466
-Come on!

40:35.260 --> 40:37.000

40:44.230 --> 40:45.265
It was me.

40:45.810 --> 40:47.141
I ’m the one that called 9-1-1.

40:50.360 --> 40:51.850
So, um...

40:52.280 --> 40:54.066
So you were at the party with him?

40:54.360 --> 40:56.817
I was there.
I saw him just before he left.

40:57.120 --> 40:58.155
And I...

40:59.370 --> 41:00.530
I don't think he was drunk.

41:02.960 --> 41:03.949
You don't?

41:04.670 --> 41:06.956
No. He told me he wasn't,
and I believed him.

41:08.290 --> 41:09.746
I mean, until...

41:16.090 --> 41:17.921
Fucking beer everywhere.

41:19.680 --> 41:20.920
It wasn't Jeff's fault.

41:23.310 --> 41:28.009
The stop sign on the corner had been
knocked down earlier in the night.

41:28.860 --> 41:32.318
I don't know. The cops thought
it was Jeff's fault, I guess.

41:32.690 --> 41:33.987
But it was already down.

41:38.200 --> 41:39.986
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

41:40.490 --> 41:42.196
How do you know this about the stop sign?

41:42.290 --> 41:44.155
Did you knock it down?

41:44.750 --> 41:46.365
No. No.

41:48.290 --> 41:50.201
Then why are you apologizing?

41:50.420 --> 41:51.956
I-I...

41:52.050 --> 41:54.086
I've been angry at Jeff since he died

41:54.760 --> 41:56.296
because he told me he was sober,

41:56.380 --> 41:58.587
and I thought he lied
and did something stupid,

41:58.680 --> 42:01.843
and I hated him for leaving that way,
and I was wrong.

42:05.520 --> 42:06.509
I was wrong.

42:35.050 --> 42:38.042
[Hannah]
I walked by their house
three times the week after Jeff died.

42:40.550 --> 42:43.098
I even got their phone number and called.

42:44.810 --> 42:46.380
And didn ’t leave a message.

42:49.520 --> 42:50.805
I wanted to tell them.

42:52.270 --> 42:53.350
I cou/dn ’t.

I think lots of anger.

43:15.760 --> 43:17.876

Anger at the whole fucking world
and the way it works.

it would never get any better.

44:17.190 --> 44:18.521
I thought you'd be here.

44:25.530 --> 44:27.282
I think I will join you.

44:37.170 --> 44:38.296
I found Jeff.

44:41.510 --> 44:43.250
I was the first person at that accident,

44:43.340 --> 44:44.420
and I found him.

44:45.760 --> 44:46.920
In his car.

44:48.560 --> 44:49.458
Dead.

44:49.770 --> 44:51.055
Jesus, Clay.

44:53.190 --> 44:55.806
Why didn't Hannah tell anyone
about the stop sign?

44:57.520 --> 44:58.760
Maybe she was afraid.

45:00.690 --> 45:02.521
I was so pissed off at Jeff.

45:03.320 --> 45:05.527
And at Hannah,
for making it all her drama.

45:06.450 --> 45:07.519
I didn't know.

45:07.620 --> 45:08.826
Well, now you do.

45:20.670 --> 45:22.410
And this just gets worse, right?

45:26.550 --> 45:27.539
Yeah.

I'm gonna listen anyway.

Cool.

45:39.110 --> 45:40.429
You don't have to hang with me.

45:41.360 --> 45:42.566
I think maybe I should.

45:43.360 --> 45:44.190

No.

thought was worse than that?

No, clearly, I don't.

You know I'm not going to do that.

46:30.410 --> 46:31.695
Tell me this, then.

46:34.000 --> 46:36.321
Tell me the truth,
and I'll listen to the tape.

No, she took her own life, Clay.
That was her choice.

46:57.350 --> 46:58.681
we all let her down.

We didn't let her know
that she had another choice.

47:02.230 --> 47:04.391
Maybe we could have saved her, maybe not.

47:05.940 --> 47:07.350
It's impossible to know.
