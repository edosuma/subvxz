WEBVTT

02:04.120 --> 02:06.580
Please, get ready,
we are extremely late, please!

02:09.790 --> 02:11.490
What's going on, honey?

02:11.690 --> 02:12.780
We are not accusing you, okay?

02:12.980 --> 02:15.160
If you left a spoon inside,
well, for that...

02:15.360 --> 02:16.570
I am not stupid, Dad!

02:16.770 --> 02:17.930
I am not saying that, my love.

08:46.060 --> 08:48.420
The streets of Carpathia are burning.

08:48.620 --> 08:50.260
These fires are not accidents.

08:50.460 --> 08:53.860
They are acts of vandalism and anarchism.
The perpetrators will face

08:54.740 --> 08:56.530
capital punishment.

08:56.950 --> 09:00.390
These are not just young girls,
they are terrorists!

09:00.590 --> 09:05.540
As your devoted president, I will restore
law and order, God help me.

09:05.920 --> 09:06.920
Fuck you all.

21:57.810 --> 21:58.630
My friend.

21:58.830 --> 22:00.610
Talk to me.

22:16.290 --> 22:18.790
I don't understand you anymore.

22:41.190 --> 22:42.520
Do you hear me?

22:44.940 --> 22:46.900
- I have heard, ma'am.
- Thank you.

41:36.870 --> 41:40.830
They are just girls, Viktor,
silly girls doing pranks.

41:42.000 --> 41:44.710
Surely you have more important things
to worry about?

41:45.290 --> 41:49.210
You think I don't know what's happening
in my own fucking country?

42:03.390 --> 42:05.560
Leave me alone.

42:11.650 --> 42:12.610
What?

42:13.780 --> 42:16.360
A visitor for you, Mrs Moskalev.

42:17.780 --> 42:18.950
Your mother.

42:29.420 --> 42:31.530
It stinks of shit out there.

42:31.730 --> 42:35.570
You can't be ambitious like that
in interviews, they won't like you.

42:35.770 --> 42:39.450
You need to be grateful,
surprised they even noticed you.

42:39.650 --> 42:42.620
But I'm the best,
that's why they interviewed me.

42:42.820 --> 42:45.890
Dear God! Are you even listening to me?

42:46.230 --> 42:49.770
Don't take so much,
your sister has to train.

42:51.400 --> 42:54.320
Show some humility.
You're not a kid anymore.

42:54.570 --> 42:56.610
- I don't work--
- We--

42:56.820 --> 43:00.280
This isn't about you!

43:01.120 --> 43:04.020
We don't work three jobs each,

43:04.220 --> 43:06.770
all these shit hours
to pay for your training

43:06.970 --> 43:09.290
so you can ruin it
with your arrogance.

43:10.540 --> 43:13.670
You can't cartwheel
with all that inside you.

43:14.750 --> 43:18.330
OK, OK, I understand,
don't be ambitious.

43:18.520 --> 43:19.530
No! No!

43:19.730 --> 43:24.580
Of course be ambitious,
of course.

43:24.780 --> 43:27.380
You must be ambitious...

43:27.580 --> 43:30.590
but you mustn't show them
you're ambitious.

43:30.790 --> 43:36.610
They won't like it. A sweet little girl
is what you have to be!

44:09.430 --> 44:11.100
You've had work done.

44:15.690 --> 44:17.190
Fancy bitch!

44:30.250 --> 44:32.000
Aren't you going to offer me
something?

44:38.340 --> 44:39.410
You're cruel.

44:39.610 --> 44:41.880
I learnt from the best.

44:46.140 --> 44:47.310
Your father is dead.

44:49.220 --> 44:51.180
He's dead and left me with nothing,

44:51.600 --> 44:53.560
not a bean in the house.

44:56.360 --> 44:58.190
Life is hard right now.

44:59.820 --> 45:01.070
There's no work.

45:03.820 --> 45:05.240
I have nothing to live on.

45:08.370 --> 45:10.500
I've barely eaten in three weeks.

45:12.500 --> 45:14.460
I have nowhere to wash.

45:15.920 --> 45:18.040
And the bunions!

45:19.210 --> 45:22.990
Look at my fucking bunions.

45:23.190 --> 45:25.800
Put them away.

45:29.640 --> 45:32.180
I've come for what I'm owed!

45:44.240 --> 45:45.910
Dad died?

45:48.370 --> 45:49.370
His heart?

45:50.410 --> 45:51.540
Drink.

45:52.950 --> 45:56.250
And not one of his daughters
attended the funeral.

45:57.130 --> 45:59.250
I did it all myself.

46:02.840 --> 46:04.420
Have you heard from Zoia?

46:05.930 --> 46:08.930
Still nothing. Nothing in all these years.

46:11.100 --> 46:14.390
I know she returned all those trinkets
you tried to send her.

46:23.280 --> 46:25.530
There is some feeling
for your family.

46:26.240 --> 46:29.100
- I knew it!
- You should go.

46:29.300 --> 46:30.530
But I only just got here.

46:30.910 --> 46:32.940
You need to leave. Ruslan!

46:33.140 --> 46:36.960
Tatiana! Tatiana, for God's sake,
I am desperate.

46:37.620 --> 46:41.880
Let me... let me stay here, rest a moment.

46:43.420 --> 46:47.160
I will help you as you helped me
all those years ago...

46:47.360 --> 46:48.950
Thank you.

46:49.150 --> 46:50.600
...which is not at all.

46:54.520 --> 46:56.500
How can you say that?

46:56.700 --> 46:58.500
Look at all you have!

46:58.700 --> 47:01.520
You think this has cost me nothing?

47:04.690 --> 47:06.320
Show her out.

47:06.740 --> 47:08.400
No goodbye for me, Mama?

47:08.820 --> 47:11.870
Your new nose looks shit.

47:14.830 --> 47:18.580
Ruslan, throw away the cakes!
