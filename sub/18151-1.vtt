01:56.909 --> 01:58.829
Morning, guys.
How's it going?

01:58.994 --> 02:02.504
Bailey, what's up? What's up?

02:02.665 --> 02:05.205
Hey, Chewie. Hey, Watson.
How's it going?

02:05.376 --> 02:07.996
Looking good. Queenie. Rascal.

02:08.169 --> 02:10.210
Yeah. OK.

02:10.381 --> 02:13.221
Who wants some food?
Who wants some food?

02:13.384 --> 02:16.604
Wolf it down. That's it.
That's all you get.

02:16.762 --> 02:18.142
Water?

02:28.107 --> 02:29.527
How are you?

02:29.692 --> 02:32.572
There she is. There she is.

02:32.736 --> 02:35.526
OK. Alright, Lexi. Alright. Hey.

02:36.699 --> 02:39.829
Back it up. Back it up.
Hey, Lexi. Back it up.

02:40.870 --> 02:43.540
Oh, hey! Hey! Hey. Big doggie.

02:43.706 --> 02:45.366
Big doggie. Big doggie.

03:20.492 --> 03:22.662
Holly, right?

03:22.828 --> 03:24.958
Holly Garling.

03:25.122 --> 03:27.672
Hi. How are you?

03:27.833 --> 03:30.593
Hi. I'm sorry.
Do we know each other?

03:30.753 --> 03:35.263
- Oh, Seth. Westbrook High.
- Oh. Were you in my class?

03:35.424 --> 03:38.144
I was in the year above you.
We didn't hang out or anything.

03:38.302 --> 03:39.722
But I knew who you were.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.557
You did?

03:41.722 --> 03:44.182
Sure. Everybody did.

03:44.350 --> 03:47.020
I don't know about that.

03:47.186 --> 03:49.476
So you're a writer now, huh?

03:49.647 --> 03:52.227
- That's cool. It's great.
- Yeah.

03:52.399 --> 03:55.899
This whole waitress uniform,
it's... it's just a disguise.

03:57.071 --> 03:59.371
It's convincing.

03:59.531 --> 04:01.621
I was gonna order
an ice-cream sundae.

04:01.784 --> 04:04.954
- Extra sprinkles.
- You wouldn't be the first.

04:12.086 --> 04:14.546
- This is my stop.
- Oh, this is you?

04:17.382 --> 04:19.723
- It was nice to see you again.
- Nice to see you too.

04:19.885 --> 04:21.385
Hey, if you're not
doing anything...

04:21.553 --> 04:23.853
..get a coffee?

04:58.882 --> 05:00.762
Hm.

05:08.684 --> 05:10.194
<i>We're looking at your numbers.</i>

05:10.352 --> 05:12.232
Hey.

05:16.483 --> 05:19.153
There he is.
There's the man.

05:26.035 --> 05:27.905
Nate. Let me ask you
a question.

05:28.078 --> 05:29.078
Mmm?

05:29.121 --> 05:32.621
If there was this girl
and you wanted her to notice you...

05:32.791 --> 05:35.841
- Are you serious right now?
- Yeah.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.303
Shit, man, I don't know you.

05:38.464 --> 05:41.224
I don't know what kind of game you got.
Why are you asking me?

05:41.383 --> 05:43.143
Sorry. I thought maybe...

05:43.302 --> 05:45.302
Listen. Wait.

05:45.471 --> 05:47.011
You like this girl?

05:47.181 --> 05:49.181
We are talking about
a girl here, right?

05:49.350 --> 05:50.980
Yes, a girl. I do like her.

05:51.143 --> 05:53.483
So just be confident, you know?

05:53.645 --> 05:56.605
Guy who's confident,
knows how to make 'em laugh.

05:56.774 --> 05:59.114
Tell 'em about your day,
acting like you give a shit.

05:59.276 --> 06:01.236
I mean, it ain't a mystery.

06:01.403 --> 06:05.073
Confident, funny, make 'em laugh.
Got it. Good. Thanks.

06:05.240 --> 06:07.740
Hey. And no more
bringing this shit to me, alright?

06:07.910 --> 06:10.660
You and me, we ain't like that.

06:10.829 --> 06:13.119
Cool.

06:17.586 --> 06:20.046
Seth, Dr Jessup needs your help.

06:20.214 --> 06:22.674
He's putting down
the German shepherd in 34.

06:22.841 --> 06:25.011
- Lexi.
- Look, you're a sweet guy.

06:25.177 --> 06:27.427
If you can't do your job,
I'll find someone who can.

06:27.596 --> 06:28.966
Is that clear?

06:29.139 --> 06:30.889
She's... really good dog.

06:33.560 --> 06:35.850
Hey, Lexi. Hey.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.901
Here's the thing. We just...

06:38.065 --> 06:39.855
Hey, girl.

06:44.405 --> 06:46.235
Hey, Lexi.

06:46.407 --> 06:48.197
Hey.

06:48.367 --> 06:51.197
How's it going?
Want to go for a walk?

06:51.370 --> 06:53.160
Hey. Hey. Hey.

06:53.330 --> 06:55.710
Good girl. Yeah, it's exciting, isn't it?

06:55.874 --> 06:58.384
Alright, Lexi. Here we go.

07:00.587 --> 07:02.797
Alright. That's a good dog.

07:02.965 --> 07:04.675
Yeah. That's a good dog.

07:04.842 --> 07:07.092
- You alright?
- Yeah. She's just a good dog.

07:07.261 --> 07:08.801
Shh. It's OK, Lexi.
It's alright.

07:08.971 --> 07:10.471
You want her,
you can always keep her.

07:10.639 --> 07:12.849
My building doesn't allow pets.
Very strict.

07:13.016 --> 07:14.726
Fucking find a new place.

07:14.893 --> 07:17.523
$9 an hour?
I'm lucky I have running water.

07:17.688 --> 07:19.728
That's your whole problem.
You got no initiative.

07:19.898 --> 07:23.238
It's how come you're still working
in a shithole like this at your age.

07:23.402 --> 07:25.402
You want something in this life,
you gotta take it.

07:25.487 --> 07:28.027
So, what's it gonna be?

07:28.198 --> 07:30.448
I mean, you want her, she's yours.

07:33.745 --> 07:35.615
Do it. Do it already.

07:36.665 --> 07:39.535
Alright, Lexi. Here we go.
You're a good dog.

07:39.710 --> 07:42.840
Hold still. You're a good dog.

09:59.891 --> 10:01.521
Hey, Holly, hey.

10:01.685 --> 10:03.395
What time do you get lunch?

10:03.562 --> 10:05.772
What... time do you get lunch?

10:05.939 --> 10:07.769
I get lunch at 1:00.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.481
1:00.

10:10.611 --> 10:12.071
Hey. Hey. Hi.

10:12.237 --> 10:13.657
Hey.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.992
Hey. Remember me?

10:16.158 --> 10:19.118
That's right. Uh...

10:19.286 --> 10:22.786
Well, I guess table for one
while I'm here, but...

10:22.956 --> 10:24.626
..really, I was just wondering

10:24.791 --> 10:28.381
if you wanted to get, maybe...
dinner later.

10:28.545 --> 10:32.125
I, uh... I don't know about you,
but I love seafood.

10:32.299 --> 10:36.179
Oh, you do? Yeah. That's all I eat.

10:36.345 --> 10:37.965
Seafood, seafood...
There's a, uh...

10:38.138 --> 10:41.808
There's a place on...
There's a place on...

10:41.975 --> 10:44.805
There's a place on Wilshire
called The Crab Joint.

10:44.978 --> 10:48.858
Oh, you know it?
Yeah, we could... Tonight?

10:50.567 --> 10:51.937
It's, uh...

10:52.110 --> 10:53.860
Hey, Holly. Hey.

10:54.029 --> 10:55.699
Hey, Holly. How's it going?

10:55.864 --> 10:57.244
Hey.

11:14.466 --> 11:16.966
- Hi. Anywhere?
- Yeah. Anywhere is fine.

11:17.135 --> 11:19.345
- Just...
- OK. Thanks.

11:34.069 --> 11:35.449
Hey. How are you?
I'm Holly.

11:35.612 --> 11:36.992
I'll be taking care
of you today.

11:37.155 --> 11:38.615
You must be a writer.

11:38.782 --> 11:40.702
- Sorry?
- A writer.

11:40.867 --> 11:44.787
The, uh, disguise, from the bus.

11:45.831 --> 11:48.001
We met a couple of days ago
on the bus.

11:48.166 --> 11:49.956
- My name's Seth.
- I'm so sorry.

11:50.127 --> 11:52.087
My memory, like,
totally sucks. I know.

11:52.254 --> 11:54.254
Just what you want to hear
from your waiter, right?

11:54.339 --> 11:56.169
No, that's fine.

11:56.341 --> 11:58.403
Can I get you started with anything?
An appetiser? Or...?

11:58.427 --> 12:00.387
Yeah. Um...

12:00.554 --> 12:04.144
Let's, uh... Let's do water.

12:04.307 --> 12:07.597
And then, by the time
you come back, I'll... I'll know.

12:07.769 --> 12:10.649
- Water. Una agua. You got it.
- Hey, um...

12:10.814 --> 12:14.864
I like your hair. It looks
different from... from the bus.

12:15.026 --> 12:17.066
- It's nice. Yeah.
- Thank you.

12:17.237 --> 12:21.067
You shouldn't feel insecure about it
or... self-conscious.

12:21.241 --> 12:25.041
It's... It is a... a good haircut.

12:26.955 --> 12:30.325
Why don't you take a look at the menu
and I will go grab your water.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.840
Yeah. Pie.

12:33.003 --> 12:34.883
Apple pie.

12:57.861 --> 12:59.611
How's it going over here?

12:59.780 --> 13:01.910
- Seth.
- What's that?

13:03.033 --> 13:04.913
Seth. My name is Seth.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.582
How's the food, Seth?

13:07.746 --> 13:09.456
It's good. It's quality.

13:09.623 --> 13:12.543
Actually, I had a question for you.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.669
Do you like Ben Folds?

13:14.836 --> 13:17.166
'Cause I have a couple of tickets
to his concert this week

13:17.339 --> 13:20.379
and the girl I was gonna go with -
not a girlfriend or anything -

13:20.550 --> 13:22.220
she can't make it,
she has a thing.

13:22.385 --> 13:24.965
I was wondering
if maybe you'd want to...

13:25.138 --> 13:26.518
..go?

13:26.681 --> 13:28.061
I'm sorry, I can't.

13:28.225 --> 13:29.725
I don't like going to shows
by myself.

13:29.893 --> 13:31.733
It feels kind of strange, you know?
So maybe...

13:31.812 --> 13:33.942
Not a big deal. No pressure.
We could just go.

13:34.105 --> 13:36.015
Wouldn't have to be
a date or anything.

13:36.191 --> 13:38.691
The thing is, I already
sort of have a boyfriend, so...

13:38.860 --> 13:41.030
No, you don't.

13:44.908 --> 13:46.908
Just gonna leave this here.

13:47.077 --> 13:50.077
- Thanks for coming in.
- Hang on... a second.

14:58.064 --> 15:01.364
<i>But, like, when they
do speak, you know you're in trouble.</i>

15:01.526 --> 15:03.066
Hey.

15:04.988 --> 15:07.988
- There's a guy out there.
- Ooh. Is he hot?

15:08.158 --> 15:12.118
- I'm serious, Claire.
- Don't get paranoid on me, Hol.

15:12.287 --> 15:14.327
You're no fun when you're paranoid.

15:14.497 --> 15:17.327
Never mind.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.460
10 bucks says it's him.

15:22.881 --> 15:24.761
- Yes, Eric.
- Hey, babe.

15:24.925 --> 15:26.675
What do you want?

15:26.843 --> 15:29.263
Jesus! What's with the attitude?
I just wanted to talk.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.059
- I've been thinking about you.
- Is he drunk and weepy again?

15:32.223 --> 15:33.933
A little bit.

15:34.100 --> 15:35.850
Who are you talking to?
You with someone?

15:36.019 --> 15:37.849
Don't get paranoid on me, Eric.

15:38.021 --> 15:39.901
You're no fun
when you're paranoid.

15:47.781 --> 15:50.991
So, the other night with Eric?

15:51.159 --> 15:54.119
Really? Are we gonna go there again?

15:54.287 --> 15:57.327
He was two years. You can't
convince me he never mattered.

15:57.499 --> 15:59.579
I'm serious, though, Hol.

15:59.751 --> 16:03.001
Being alone is just... kinda shitty.

16:04.381 --> 16:06.681
So, what, I'm just supposed
to forget everything he did?

16:06.841 --> 16:10.551
Yes. Forget, forgive.
Move the fuck on already.

16:10.720 --> 16:13.100
Just go back to the way things were.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.765
You know I can't do that.

16:26.903 --> 16:28.703
To us.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.447
Hey, Sam.

16:36.538 --> 16:38.788
- Someone's popular.
- What?

16:38.957 --> 16:40.707
We put it
in the break room.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.170
OK...

17:03.356 --> 17:05.726
Lucky bitch.

17:05.900 --> 17:07.859
Spill. Who's the guy?

17:19.955 --> 17:22.665
- Hey.
- Hey.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.339
Listen. I'm so sorry
for the drunk dial the other night.

17:26.503 --> 17:28.924
- I mean, you know how it is.
- Yeah, I do.

17:29.090 --> 17:31.760
Listen. Can I get you a beer
or something?

17:31.926 --> 17:36.346
Eric. You have to stop
doing stuff like this.

17:36.514 --> 17:39.684
Stuff like... What now?

17:39.851 --> 17:41.601
Come on.

17:41.770 --> 17:43.940
Roses? You know they're my favourite.

17:44.105 --> 17:47.225
I didn't know that.

17:48.610 --> 17:51.910
OK. Well, now I just feel stupid.

17:52.072 --> 17:53.992
- I should go.
- Just one beer.

17:56.034 --> 17:59.164
It wasn't all bad, right?
We had some good times.

18:00.789 --> 18:02.669
Yep.

18:02.832 --> 18:04.582
So, why don't we
give it another shot?

18:06.294 --> 18:09.214
Are you really gonna make me
say her name?

18:11.466 --> 18:14.256
..thousand times,
and you know if I could take it back,

18:14.427 --> 18:16.097
I would, in a heartbeat.

18:18.723 --> 18:21.023
This is so fucking stupid.

18:21.184 --> 18:22.814
I mean, we had something.

18:22.977 --> 18:24.347
Had.

18:24.521 --> 18:26.061
Eric, past tense.

18:31.277 --> 18:33.277
I'm gonna get some air.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.506
Nice night.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.889
- Yeah.
- Yep.

19:04.310 --> 19:07.480
- Not a smoker?
- Me? No.

19:09.065 --> 19:11.935
That's good. Don't ever start.
It's a terrible habit.

19:12.110 --> 19:14.200
OK, I won't.

19:14.362 --> 19:16.032
Thanks.

19:29.961 --> 19:33.511
- Have a nice night.
- You like the flowers?

19:34.632 --> 19:37.182
You seemed like a red-and-white
roses kind of girl.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.143
- It was just a guess.
- Oh, my God.

19:39.304 --> 19:40.854
You're that guy
from the restaurant.

19:41.014 --> 19:43.314
Seth.

19:43.474 --> 19:45.161
What, are you, like,
following me or something?

19:45.185 --> 19:47.515
What? No. Just...

19:47.687 --> 19:50.817
Look, I'm not some psycho, OK?
You know me.

19:50.982 --> 19:53.532
- We went to school together.
- What do you want?

19:53.693 --> 19:57.033
I don't want anything.
I just want to talk to you.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.117
When I saw you on the bus
the other day,

19:59.282 --> 20:02.162
after all these years,
I... I felt something.

20:02.327 --> 20:05.207
I know you did.
I can't just walk away from that.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.671
- I don't even know you.
- Yeah, but you will.

20:09.667 --> 20:11.667
You can go. I just...
Can I just talk to you?

20:11.836 --> 20:14.256
- Hey, come on.
- Don't! Don't touch me. Move!

20:14.422 --> 20:15.762
You kidding me?

20:15.924 --> 20:17.304
Just let me
talk to you?

20:17.467 --> 20:18.757
- Fuck you. Fuck you!
- Holly?

20:18.927 --> 20:20.887
- Just let me explain.
- He tried to grab me.

20:21.054 --> 20:23.564
What? No. Hey.
That is not true at all, man.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.813
Fuck off!

20:28.728 --> 20:30.768
- Did he hurt you?
- I'm fine.

20:33.483 --> 20:35.403
You think this is funny?

20:35.568 --> 20:39.068
- Eric, stop. Stop it.
- Laugh it up, dickhead.

20:39.239 --> 20:41.869
Let me handle this. Come on!

20:43.952 --> 20:45.542
Get the fuck away from her!

20:45.703 --> 20:48.623
Don't you ever
come back here!

22:13.124 --> 22:15.464
Maybe if you retrace your steps.

22:15.626 --> 22:18.166
No. It's gotta be here somewhere.

22:18.338 --> 22:21.088
Well, was your name in it?
Or, like, any contact information?

22:23.092 --> 22:24.642
What do you think?

28:37.967 --> 28:39.507
Ah!

28:42.513 --> 28:45.143
You fucking bitch!

30:48.138 --> 30:50.928
Claire? You here?

31:50.409 --> 31:51.949
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

31:52.119 --> 31:54.909
What I just put in you
is called pancuronium bromide.

31:55.080 --> 31:58.290
It's a paralysing agent. Stings a little.

31:58.459 --> 32:02.129
Don't worry. It's safe.
I tested it on myself.

32:41.335 --> 32:42.915
- What you doing here?
- Oh.

32:43.087 --> 32:44.837
Boss lady calls
in the middle of the night.

32:45.005 --> 32:47.715
- Gotta make a delivery.
- Not so fast, man.

32:49.134 --> 32:50.644
Sign in.

32:54.723 --> 32:56.643
Right.

33:09.571 --> 33:12.281
- Excuse me.
- The hell's that?

33:13.575 --> 33:16.575
I think it's, uh, delousing powder.

33:16.745 --> 33:18.995
Alright. See you later.

33:26.714 --> 33:29.434
- You hear that?
- What?

33:35.222 --> 33:38.312
- Something wrong?
- Shh.

33:43.188 --> 33:45.518
- You hear something?
- Quiet, man.

33:48.152 --> 33:50.572
You heard that, right?

33:52.281 --> 33:53.821
That "Uh!" sound.

33:53.991 --> 33:55.451
I don't hear anything.

33:55.617 --> 33:57.237
What is it?

34:08.047 --> 34:10.377
Fucking AC, man.

34:11.884 --> 34:13.304
Shit's always going out.

34:13.469 --> 34:15.799
Got it. Got it.

34:15.971 --> 34:18.641
- It's, uh, broken?
- It's always broken.

34:18.806 --> 34:21.637
- This whole place sucks.
- Alright.

35:42.099 --> 35:44.229
Ugh! Ah!

36:02.119 --> 36:03.659
Shut up!

36:50.375 --> 36:52.165
So...

36:52.336 --> 36:55.006
I'm Seth, in case you forgot.

36:55.172 --> 36:57.932
Fuck you.

37:05.933 --> 37:08.693
- Your choice.
- Fuck you!

37:08.852 --> 37:10.562
I'm doing this
for your own good.

37:11.688 --> 37:13.228
We'll try this again tomorrow.

37:20.822 --> 37:22.782
Fuck you!

38:59.880 --> 39:01.630
Hi.

39:05.761 --> 39:08.061
I brought you some water.

39:13.643 --> 39:15.853
Here. Drink this.

39:18.065 --> 39:20.395
It's alright.

39:21.526 --> 39:25.066
Alright. Breathe.
Breathe. Breathe. Sit up.

39:25.238 --> 39:26.618
Sorry.

39:27.699 --> 39:29.659
Take it easy. It's OK.

39:29.826 --> 39:34.076
I brought food as well,
in case you feel up for it.

39:34.247 --> 39:36.247
Water.

39:36.416 --> 39:38.246
Food.

39:42.672 --> 39:46.052
Just take it easy, alright?
That's all you're getting today.

39:49.137 --> 39:51.597
Wait!
Please don't leave me.

39:53.225 --> 39:55.055
I know this is hard.

39:56.478 --> 39:58.188
It's hard for me too.

40:01.900 --> 40:04.990
But it's important
to define our relationship.

40:06.029 --> 40:08.949
Establish some boundaries.

40:09.991 --> 40:12.541
This. This doesn't work.

40:14.704 --> 40:16.254
That's right.

40:17.749 --> 40:21.209
I'll come back tomorrow
and we'll get started.

41:19.561 --> 41:21.271
He's gonna kill you.

41:22.731 --> 41:24.271
But you know that.

41:26.485 --> 41:29.065
Maybe he'll lose his nerve, huh?

41:29.237 --> 41:30.777
Chicken out.

41:32.073 --> 41:34.703
- Or maybe he'll just get bored.
- You're not helping.

41:34.868 --> 41:37.038
He won't even need a gun, Holly.

41:37.204 --> 41:39.874
All he has to do is walk away.

41:40.040 --> 41:41.580
Shut up.

41:44.503 --> 41:47.553
Look at you.
You're letting him beat you?

41:47.714 --> 41:50.264
That pathetic little shit?

41:51.635 --> 41:54.845
If that's all it takes,
then maybe you deserve to be in there.

41:55.013 --> 41:56.563
Shut up!

43:12.757 --> 43:15.087
Are you gonna rape me?

43:15.260 --> 43:16.850
No.

43:19.472 --> 43:21.022
Kill me?

43:22.142 --> 43:23.772
I hope not.

43:27.897 --> 43:29.767
You HOPE not?

43:31.568 --> 43:33.398
Might not have a choice.

43:34.446 --> 43:37.116
And why's that?

43:39.534 --> 43:42.084
I might not be able to save you.

43:43.330 --> 43:46.210
What is this, some kind of
fucking religious thing?

43:46.374 --> 43:49.964
Did God tell you to punish
all the whores, something like that?

43:51.379 --> 43:53.549
It's a different kind of saving.

43:53.715 --> 43:55.625
- And no.
- So, what?

43:55.800 --> 43:58.140
You're just a sick fuck?
This is how you get your kicks?

43:58.303 --> 44:00.013
I'm not doing this for me.

44:00.180 --> 44:02.720
Doing this for you.

44:02.891 --> 44:05.391
Because you're special.

44:07.020 --> 44:09.440
Special?

44:09.606 --> 44:11.686
It's true.

44:11.858 --> 44:14.028
Before I met you, I was just...

44:14.194 --> 44:17.164
..floating through life...

44:18.198 --> 44:20.278
..like any minute,
I could just drift off.

44:20.450 --> 44:22.660
No-one would even notice.

44:24.579 --> 44:26.289
Then you came along.

44:27.374 --> 44:30.174
And... the thing...

44:31.252 --> 44:33.382
..the thing that made it so hard is...

44:33.546 --> 44:35.916
..is I thought you were different.

44:37.592 --> 44:40.602
You're smart. Funny.

44:42.013 --> 44:46.393
When you talked to me, you saw me.
You really... saw me.

44:48.144 --> 44:50.654
That's just what
you wanted me to see, huh?

44:52.857 --> 44:56.067
The version of Holly you are
when everyone's watching.

44:56.236 --> 44:58.526
We both know that's a lie, don't we?

45:00.615 --> 45:02.155
Go to hell.

45:03.201 --> 45:04.541
That's the question.

45:04.703 --> 45:07.043
Which one's the real Holly?

45:07.205 --> 45:08.915
The Holly on the outside or...

45:09.082 --> 45:11.332
..the other Holly?

45:11.501 --> 45:14.461
Because if there's even a chance
I can save you,

45:14.629 --> 45:16.169
I have to take it.

45:18.466 --> 45:22.096
But if that's it,
if there's nothing left to save,

45:22.262 --> 45:24.432
then you're never
leaving this room.

45:34.441 --> 45:36.111
What you doing here?

45:36.276 --> 45:38.696
Man, if they catch you
fucking around in them tunnels...

45:38.862 --> 45:41.322
They won't catch me.
I'm not going in there.

45:41.489 --> 45:43.369
Just grab a mop.

45:43.533 --> 45:45.533
We got that place
smelling like dog shit out there.

45:45.618 --> 45:47.158
Shit.

46:02.677 --> 46:04.887
This fuckin' dude is a joke.

46:07.766 --> 46:09.636
So...

46:10.977 --> 46:12.897
What are you gonna do now?

46:15.106 --> 46:16.726
I'm gonna wait.

46:19.527 --> 46:21.067
Good girl.

46:40.882 --> 46:43.132
It's a real page-turner.

46:48.306 --> 46:50.136
You're a hell of a writer.
You know that?

46:50.308 --> 46:52.228
You're a thief.

46:54.521 --> 46:56.521
And now what?

46:57.565 --> 47:00.065
Suddenly, you've got me all figured out?

47:00.235 --> 47:02.235
I wish. No.

47:03.738 --> 47:06.028
Mostly, I just felt sorry for you.

47:07.075 --> 47:08.985
You...

47:09.160 --> 47:11.040
..felt sorry for me.

47:11.204 --> 47:13.674
Yeah, just the part
where you talk about love.

47:13.832 --> 47:19.252
"Love is just a label
for our biological imperatives."

47:19.420 --> 47:22.260
I don't know. Felt ignorant to me.

47:22.423 --> 47:25.133
Are you really gonna lecture me
on love, Seth?

47:25.301 --> 47:27.551
You're keeping a girl in a cage.

47:29.556 --> 47:31.676
I think I finally figured it out.

47:31.850 --> 47:34.350
All these people
who talk about love

47:34.519 --> 47:37.729
like it's this lightning bolt
from the sky,

47:37.897 --> 47:40.477
this irresistible force.

47:40.650 --> 47:44.030
So you think,
"Well, I've never felt that."

47:45.071 --> 47:46.951
But those people are wrong.

47:47.115 --> 47:49.075
Love's not a lightning bolt.

47:49.242 --> 47:52.202
Love, real love,

47:52.370 --> 47:54.080
takes work.

47:55.540 --> 47:57.040
Sacrifice.

47:57.208 --> 48:01.128
Real love is giving everything you have
to someone else.

48:01.296 --> 48:04.586
- That's love.
- Fucking kidding me.

48:04.757 --> 48:06.627
You don't think?

48:06.801 --> 48:08.601
"Love is sacrifice."

48:08.761 --> 48:11.101
You know who believes that?

48:11.264 --> 48:13.184
People who hate themselves.

48:13.349 --> 48:16.769
Who are alone, depressed.
Just like you.

48:16.936 --> 48:19.106
- Think I hate myself?
- I know you do.

48:19.272 --> 48:21.272
You hate yourself so much,
you can't even imagine

48:21.441 --> 48:23.861
how fucked up someone would
have to be to love you back.

48:24.027 --> 48:27.157
So you convince yourself
that love is this thing that you can buy!

48:27.322 --> 48:29.872
That all you have to do is keep giving.

48:30.033 --> 48:33.083
Well, like I said,
I just feel sorry for you.

48:33.244 --> 48:35.714
Spare me the fucking pity.
I'm not the one who's alone here.

48:35.872 --> 48:38.042
No, I guess not.

48:45.006 --> 48:49.386
And how is Claire these days?

48:53.556 --> 48:55.136
What are you talking about?

48:55.308 --> 48:58.268
You know, sometimes
before I open that door...

48:58.436 --> 49:01.016
..I can hear you talking in here.

49:01.189 --> 49:02.899
To Claire.

49:03.066 --> 49:07.196
The way you do two voices
scared the hell out of me at first.

49:07.362 --> 49:09.862
You don't know
what you're talking about.

49:10.031 --> 49:12.411
I know more than you think.

49:13.451 --> 49:15.541
Is she here right now?

49:19.207 --> 49:20.997
No.

49:21.167 --> 49:23.127
She's not real.

49:23.294 --> 49:25.634
You don't think I know that?

49:25.797 --> 49:28.167
I think you're starting to forget.

49:28.341 --> 49:30.011
Don't get paranoid on me, Eric.

49:30.176 --> 49:32.886
You're no fun when you're paranoid.

49:33.054 --> 49:35.814
You're sick, Holly.

49:35.974 --> 49:39.144
Feeding that sickness
until all it does is eat.

49:44.190 --> 49:46.400
You just have it all figured out,
don't you?

49:46.567 --> 49:48.237
Almost.

49:48.403 --> 49:50.993
One thing I still don't understand.

49:53.032 --> 49:54.582
The journal.

49:56.202 --> 49:58.792
First, I get it.
You and Eric are getting engaged.

49:58.955 --> 50:00.915
Blah, blah, blah.

50:01.082 --> 50:03.542
But here comes your best friend, Claire.
The real Claire.

50:05.962 --> 50:07.512
Holly can't eat.
Holly can't sleep.

50:07.672 --> 50:09.752
Holly wants to confront them,
but Holly's too scared.

50:09.841 --> 50:11.011
Fuck you!

50:14.262 --> 50:15.852
Then here.

50:16.889 --> 50:19.269
Here's where it gets really interesting.

50:21.102 --> 50:23.562
I get home and there's
20 messages from Dwayne, right?

50:23.730 --> 50:26.230
He's like, "Where are you?
Why haven't you picked me up yet?"

50:26.399 --> 50:29.819
Even though he's the one who said
he was coming to get me on Saturday.

50:29.986 --> 50:32.406
You know, somehow, of course,
it's just magically my fault.

50:34.449 --> 50:36.029
Were you gonna tell me?

50:36.200 --> 50:38.540
Tell you what?

50:40.913 --> 50:42.583
Come on, Claire.

50:42.749 --> 50:45.879
- You know.
- Um, not really.

50:47.086 --> 50:48.376
Eric.

50:52.675 --> 50:54.295
How'd you find out?

50:54.469 --> 50:56.309
His email. He doesn't know
I have the password.

50:56.387 --> 50:58.767
- Shit.
- Yeah.

50:58.931 --> 51:01.981
Holly. What do you want me to say?

51:02.143 --> 51:05.693
You know, I'm sorry. We were so drunk.
It didn't mean anything.

51:05.855 --> 51:08.265
Oh, well, as long as
it didn't mean anything.

51:08.441 --> 51:09.861
OK. Holly,
please slow the car down.

51:10.026 --> 51:11.316
You're unbelievable.

51:13.446 --> 51:15.656
- Do you know that?
- I'm sorry.

51:15.823 --> 51:18.203
You have no idea how shitty I feel
about this whole thing.

51:18.367 --> 51:19.787
Holly, please
slow the car down. OK?

51:19.952 --> 51:21.832
You're supposed to be
my best fucking friend.

51:21.996 --> 51:23.746
Holly, come on. Jesus!

51:27.168 --> 51:29.128
Holly! Goddamnit!
You're gonna kill us!

51:33.758 --> 51:35.468
Boom.

52:00.451 --> 52:02.081
Oh, my God.

52:02.245 --> 52:05.155
Oh, my fucking God.

52:05.331 --> 52:08.331
We're OK, alright?

52:10.128 --> 52:11.838
We're gonna be OK, Holly.

52:14.257 --> 52:17.177
We're... OK, Hol.

52:17.343 --> 52:19.513
We're gonna be... be fine.

52:21.597 --> 52:23.887
We're gonna be OK.

52:24.058 --> 52:25.768
We're gonna be fine.

52:50.334 --> 52:52.044
And you think that's what?

52:52.211 --> 52:54.171
A confession?

52:54.338 --> 52:57.508
I'm a writer, Seth.
Fiction's kind of what I do.

53:00.553 --> 53:02.603
That's why I didn't go
straight to the police.

53:03.639 --> 53:05.179
I had to be sure.

53:07.310 --> 53:09.270
I thought I'd follow you around
for a few days,

53:09.437 --> 53:11.227
but you didn't make me
wait long.

53:16.235 --> 53:19.855
It was a risky move, even for you.

53:36.047 --> 53:38.417
There were so many.

53:41.469 --> 53:44.559
You want to know what I think?
I think you wanted to get caught.

53:44.722 --> 53:48.232
That's why you kept the journal.

53:48.392 --> 53:50.142
You wanted to get punished.

53:50.311 --> 53:53.271
Lucky you came along.

53:55.942 --> 53:57.692
You don't get it, do you?

53:59.153 --> 54:01.783
This isn't punishment.

54:01.948 --> 54:04.448
I'm trying to save you.

54:04.617 --> 54:06.697
Then do it.

54:07.745 --> 54:09.705
Save me.

54:13.542 --> 54:15.092
I will.

54:18.297 --> 54:20.337
I will.

54:22.343 --> 54:23.893
I meant what I said.

54:25.846 --> 54:28.426
I'm gonna stop you
hurting other people.

54:28.599 --> 54:30.479
One way or the other.

54:51.580 --> 54:54.170
And the Oscar goes to...

54:55.376 --> 54:57.546
He wants to save me.

54:57.712 --> 55:01.012
I have to let him think
there's a chance.

55:01.173 --> 55:03.633
So that was all an act?

55:06.220 --> 55:07.850
You were just humouring him?

55:08.014 --> 55:09.474
Playing along?

55:09.640 --> 55:11.520
If you've got
something to say...

55:12.560 --> 55:16.190
I'm just making sure
your head's still in the game.

55:17.732 --> 55:20.612
I don't need another
useless pep talk, Claire.

55:20.776 --> 55:23.356
And I don't need you.

55:47.928 --> 55:50.388
Yes?

55:51.807 --> 55:54.307
What? No. Nothing.

55:55.353 --> 55:58.403
Just... was curious.

55:58.564 --> 56:00.324
Why you did it.

56:00.483 --> 56:04.573
I guess when I saw Eric's email,
all those messages from Claire...

56:04.737 --> 56:07.277
No, not Claire. I understand that.

56:07.448 --> 56:10.028
It's a crime of passion or whatever.

56:10.201 --> 56:13.121
I want to know why you didn't stop there.

56:13.287 --> 56:15.747
Why you killed the others.

56:15.915 --> 56:17.995
'Cause you felt guilty,
for what you did to Claire,

56:18.167 --> 56:19.587
for getting away with it.

56:19.752 --> 56:21.252
You wanted to get caught,
didn't you?

56:21.420 --> 56:23.170
No.

56:23.339 --> 56:25.219
Because I could.

56:26.258 --> 56:28.298
Yeah. I don't believe that.

56:28.469 --> 56:30.759
Well, I don't care what you believe.

56:30.930 --> 56:32.850
'Cause, see,
here's the thing, Seth.

56:33.015 --> 56:35.385
When someone dies in front of you
the way Claire died,

56:35.559 --> 56:39.189
it's like your whole world
just snaps into focus.

56:40.356 --> 56:42.896
- Cry for help?
- It was a way to pass the time.

56:43.067 --> 56:44.937
Don't pretend
you know what I am.

56:45.111 --> 56:47.911
You're wrong. I do know you.
I know you from this.

56:48.072 --> 56:51.242
And the girl who wrote this,
you had dreams.

56:51.409 --> 56:52.949
She cared about people.

56:53.119 --> 56:55.329
Was scared to be alone.

56:55.496 --> 56:58.576
This is the real you. Not...

57:05.089 --> 57:08.129
Seth's got a little crush.

57:09.176 --> 57:10.846
This isn't about us.

57:11.011 --> 57:13.761
If you love something, set it free.

57:13.931 --> 57:16.231
Isn't that how that goes?

57:17.977 --> 57:20.227
You know I can't do that.

57:21.647 --> 57:24.187
Do you know what happens
to a great white shark

57:24.358 --> 57:27.028
when you put him
inside an aquarium?

57:28.070 --> 57:31.780
It bashes its brains against the glass.
Every time.

57:31.949 --> 57:33.869
Come on.

57:34.034 --> 57:36.204
Stop! Holly! Stop!

57:36.370 --> 57:37.870
Stop! Holly!

57:39.623 --> 57:41.753
What are you gonna do
when you come down here tomorrow

57:41.917 --> 57:44.087
and I'm belly-up in the tank, huh?

57:45.254 --> 57:47.134
'Cause you can't just walk away.

57:47.298 --> 57:50.428
Not with your fingerprints
all over the place.

57:51.719 --> 57:56.099
I kill myself, your life ends too.

58:00.561 --> 58:05.771
So how's that for the boundaries
of our fucking relationship?

58:45.981 --> 58:47.651
- Seth?
- Hm?

58:47.816 --> 58:50.146
Finish this up
and come see me in my office.

58:56.367 --> 58:58.327
Something wrong?

58:58.494 --> 59:01.164
"Is something wrong?"
That's the question, isn't it?

59:02.790 --> 59:04.790
I'm not following you.

59:04.959 --> 59:09.049
The kennels are filthy.
There's the stock room. Where's Seth?

59:09.213 --> 59:11.093
He's not here, that's for sure.

59:11.257 --> 59:13.297
Nate says you haven't been here
in two days.

59:13.467 --> 59:15.967
Mrs Gundy, Nate is hardly...

59:16.136 --> 59:18.176
Nate does his job.

59:18.347 --> 59:20.307
You should have done yours.

59:21.350 --> 59:22.730
You're firing me?

59:22.893 --> 59:24.603
Disciplinary notice.

59:25.646 --> 59:27.146
This goes in
your permanent record.

59:27.314 --> 59:28.833
One more strike and you're gone.
Understand?

59:28.857 --> 59:30.227
Understood. Thank you.

59:30.401 --> 59:32.191
You don't know
how much this means to me.

59:38.659 --> 59:40.739
This... this is
what's gonna happen to you

59:40.911 --> 59:42.501
when you think
you're in control.

59:42.663 --> 59:44.463
You think
you're in control, Holly.

59:45.833 --> 59:49.253
Well, this is what'll happen
when you think you're in...

59:49.420 --> 59:51.880
I control the situation.

59:58.429 --> 01:00:00.809
There's the man.
Just doing some maintenance.

01:00:00.973 --> 01:00:02.643
Didn't ask.

01:00:06.645 --> 01:00:09.185
Hey, Seth,
I got your pay cheque.

01:00:24.163 --> 01:00:26.713
Still here, huh?

01:00:32.046 --> 01:00:33.916
Where's the rest?

01:00:36.508 --> 01:00:39.008
There is no rest.

01:00:39.178 --> 01:00:42.428
This is what happens when
you start acting like you're in control.

01:00:42.598 --> 01:00:44.928
- That's not enough.
- You don't get to decide that.

01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.190
Fuck you!

01:00:47.353 --> 01:00:51.443
Fuck me? I go through hell for you
and you threaten me?

01:00:51.607 --> 01:00:53.727
You ever pull that shit again,
I'll show you

01:00:53.901 --> 01:00:56.031
what a real hunger strike feels like.

01:00:56.195 --> 01:00:57.905
Fuck YOU.

01:01:05.037 --> 01:01:07.537
I had a dream last night.
You were in it.

01:01:09.833 --> 01:01:11.423
It was just the two of us,

01:01:11.585 --> 01:01:14.165
and we were in this house
down by the water.

01:01:14.338 --> 01:01:16.378
And I think we'd been
living there a long time,

01:01:16.548 --> 01:01:19.258
'cause there were these
pictures on the walls, pictures of us.

01:01:20.719 --> 01:01:23.809
It was weird looking at them, because...

01:01:23.972 --> 01:01:26.772
..something about it felt right.

01:01:26.934 --> 01:01:29.814
Like this, this whole world,
is the dream and...

01:01:29.978 --> 01:01:33.358
..that house on the beach, that's reality.

01:01:34.483 --> 01:01:36.993
That's how things are supposed to be.

01:01:45.452 --> 01:01:48.582
Maybe get you some snacks
from the vending machine.

01:01:49.623 --> 01:01:51.503
Thanks, Seth.

01:03:18.962 --> 01:03:21.132
Holy shit!

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:23.298
There's a light on the wall.

01:03:28.388 --> 01:03:30.388
Hey. What's your name?

01:03:30.557 --> 01:03:32.597
Um... I'm Nate.

01:03:32.768 --> 01:03:34.558
Listen to me, Nate.

01:03:34.728 --> 01:03:36.808
You have to find something
to break open this lock.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.610
Can you do that?

01:03:38.774 --> 01:03:41.114
What kind of fucked-up...

01:03:41.276 --> 01:03:42.736
Did Seth do this?!

01:03:42.903 --> 01:03:44.823
Nate, there's no time
for that right now.

01:04:06.802 --> 01:04:09.352
- OK, go at it hard, at an angle.
- We gotta call somebody.

01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:12.353
- The cops or whatever.
- Get me out of here right now.

01:04:28.824 --> 01:04:31.454
- Keep going.
- That's what I'm doing.

01:04:31.618 --> 01:04:33.618
No, just... just...

01:04:33.787 --> 01:04:37.367
- Harder!
- This is all fucked up.

01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:42.050
- OK, that's great.
- OK, on three. Alright?

01:04:42.212 --> 01:04:45.302
One, two, three!

01:04:48.677 --> 01:04:50.007
Fuck.

01:04:50.178 --> 01:04:51.928
Hold on.

01:04:52.097 --> 01:04:53.927
Do you know
what real love is, Nate?

01:04:54.099 --> 01:04:56.689
- What?
- You know, real love.

01:04:56.852 --> 01:04:59.652
Say you loved somebody
but she got sick.

01:04:59.813 --> 01:05:03.073
And then someone came along one day
to pull the plug on her,

01:05:03.233 --> 01:05:05.033
to take her
away from you forever.

01:05:05.193 --> 01:05:07.913
- What would you do?
- I don't know.

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:09.571
I just want to
get you outta here.

01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:11.780
You would do anything
to stop that from happening.

01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:13.660
Anything at all,
no matter what the cost,

01:05:13.827 --> 01:05:17.157
because that's... what love is.

01:05:18.790 --> 01:05:21.790
Love is sacrifice.

01:05:26.298 --> 01:05:28.628
What the fuck?

01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:30.640
You gonna die!

01:05:32.179 --> 01:05:33.179
Oh!

01:05:33.263 --> 01:05:35.103
Are you stabbing me?!

01:05:35.265 --> 01:05:37.475
Arggh!

01:05:39.019 --> 01:05:41.099
Motherfucker!

01:05:45.817 --> 01:05:48.357
The block, Seth.
Use the cinder block.

01:05:48.528 --> 01:05:50.698
- He's moving. Come on. Use it.
- I can't.

01:05:50.864 --> 01:05:54.164
You have to. Seth, I can't lose you.

01:05:54.326 --> 01:05:59.366
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

01:06:00.457 --> 01:06:03.707
I can't feel my legs.

01:06:03.877 --> 01:06:05.997
What the fuck?

01:06:09.716 --> 01:06:12.296
Somebody help me!

01:06:12.469 --> 01:06:14.599
Oh!

01:06:16.807 --> 01:06:18.347
Oh, my...

01:06:20.769 --> 01:06:22.599
Come on. Do it again.

01:06:30.696 --> 01:06:32.566
One more time.

01:06:37.619 --> 01:06:39.709
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:06:39.871 --> 01:06:42.541
Seth. You have to listen to me. OK?

01:06:42.708 --> 01:06:44.998
You have to do exactly what I say.

01:06:45.168 --> 01:06:47.048
Are you listening? OK.

01:06:47.212 --> 01:06:50.472
Step one is disposing of the body.
The sooner, the better.

01:06:50.632 --> 01:06:54.182
OK, burn it, bury it, sink it, whatever.
Get it out of here.

01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:57.144
But you can't do that
before you get rid of any identifiers.

01:06:57.305 --> 01:06:59.925
Teeth, tattoos, fingerprints.

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:02.690
Fingerprints are easy.
You can use a carrot peeler for that.

01:07:02.853 --> 01:07:04.313
The teeth,
you need to scatter them.

01:07:04.479 --> 01:07:06.229
Dumpsters, in water, whatever.

01:07:06.398 --> 01:07:09.188
Just not all in the same place.

01:07:09.359 --> 01:07:11.239
And then there's just the body
to worry about.

01:07:14.156 --> 01:07:16.406
It's not gonna fit
in the incinerator.

01:07:16.575 --> 01:07:19.155
Well... not like that.

01:07:46.646 --> 01:07:47.686
Here.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:26.231
Do you want to practise
what you're gonna say?

01:08:30.607 --> 01:08:33.107
Hey. Mrs Gundy, it's Seth.

01:08:34.277 --> 01:08:36.567
Sorry to call you so late. Um...

01:08:36.738 --> 01:08:39.868
Yeah. Nate asked me to watch the front
while he ran some errands.

01:08:40.033 --> 01:08:43.662
And he's still not back yet.
I don't know where he went.

01:08:43.828 --> 01:08:45.709
O...

01:08:45.872 --> 01:08:47.292
OK. Goodnight.

01:08:47.457 --> 01:08:48.787
Sorry.

01:09:37.006 --> 01:09:40.087
- How do you feel?
- I don't know.

01:09:40.260 --> 01:09:43.220
Disconnected. Like it happened
to someone else, you know?

01:09:43.388 --> 01:09:45.638
The first time's always the worst.

01:09:46.683 --> 01:09:49.733
There is no first time.
It was an accident. I told you.

01:09:49.895 --> 01:09:52.305
You know what always got to me...

01:09:52.479 --> 01:09:54.400
..was the questions.

01:09:54.566 --> 01:09:56.736
I remember in the beginning,
all I could think about

01:09:56.902 --> 01:09:58.902
was what if she had a pet?

01:09:59.070 --> 01:10:03.330
This poor little doggie just...
sitting by the door

01:10:03.491 --> 01:10:05.741
waiting for her to come home.

01:10:05.911 --> 01:10:08.251
But all that goes away.

01:10:08.413 --> 01:10:10.043
The more you think about it,

01:10:10.207 --> 01:10:12.457
the more you remember
the parts that you liked.

01:10:12.626 --> 01:10:14.376
How it made you feel.

01:10:14.544 --> 01:10:16.884
Like you were in control of your life
for the first time,

01:10:17.047 --> 01:10:18.417
like nothing could hurt you.

01:10:18.590 --> 01:10:19.970
That's not how it was.

01:10:20.133 --> 01:10:22.263
But the only problem is...

01:10:22.427 --> 01:10:25.677
..that sooner or later,
it all goes back to normal.

01:10:26.723 --> 01:10:31.233
All of a sudden, you're nothing special.
You're just you.

01:10:31.394 --> 01:10:33.064
Stop, OK?

01:10:33.230 --> 01:10:35.230
And that's when
you start to wonder

01:10:35.398 --> 01:10:38.398
how far you'd have to go
to get that feeling back.

01:10:38.568 --> 01:10:40.648
It's not the same.

01:10:40.820 --> 01:10:44.620
There is no shame
in accepting what you are, Seth.

01:10:44.783 --> 01:10:47.043
I did it to keep us safe.
I had no choice.

01:10:47.202 --> 01:10:49.042
Didn't you ever wonder why...

01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:53.380
..all the girls in the world,
but you get a hard-on for me?

01:10:53.541 --> 01:10:56.921
And you think that's, what,
a coincidence?

01:10:57.087 --> 01:10:59.917
You and me, we were born to do this.

01:11:00.090 --> 01:11:03.430
Don't act like you know
a goddamn thing about me.

01:11:03.593 --> 01:11:06.473
I know that a normal person
finds a murder confession

01:11:06.638 --> 01:11:08.928
and goes to the police,
not to PetSmart.

01:11:09.099 --> 01:11:12.809
Oh, yeah - "Excuse me, Officer.
See that girl over there, the waitress?

01:11:12.978 --> 01:11:14.768
"She's Hannibal Lecter.
You know how I know?

01:11:14.938 --> 01:11:16.818
"I broke into her apartment
and stole her shit."

01:11:16.856 --> 01:11:19.146
Oh, and so plan B is kidnapping?

01:11:19.317 --> 01:11:20.777
Because the fucking alternative

01:11:20.944 --> 01:11:23.364
was sitting around
watching you hurt someone else.

01:11:23.530 --> 01:11:24.910
Mmm.

01:11:25.949 --> 01:11:28.329
Good thing no-one got hurt.

01:11:28.493 --> 01:11:30.203
I told you.

01:11:30.370 --> 01:11:33.960
I told you. It was an accident.

01:11:34.124 --> 01:11:35.964
Face it, Seth.

01:11:36.126 --> 01:11:40.296
This was never about saving lives.
You like this.

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:42.883
You like having that kind of power.

01:11:43.049 --> 01:11:46.219
- Deciding who lives, who dies.
- Holly.

01:11:46.386 --> 01:11:48.216
It's not too late.

01:11:48.388 --> 01:11:50.058
I can save you.

01:11:50.223 --> 01:11:51.773
Please.

01:11:53.393 --> 01:11:55.943
Please. I can save you.

01:12:00.108 --> 01:12:02.398
Maybe you're not supposed to save me.

01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:07.820
Maybe I'm supposed to save you.

01:12:12.203 --> 01:12:14.083
Don't. Don't.

01:12:31.723 --> 01:12:35.563
Seth. Please help me. I'm so cold.
Please make me warm.

01:12:35.727 --> 01:12:38.227
Can you help me?
Can you please make me warm?

01:12:44.027 --> 01:12:47.567
I thought you loved me.

01:12:49.407 --> 01:12:51.027
I do.

01:12:53.912 --> 01:12:55.542
I do love you.

01:12:56.623 --> 01:12:58.173
Holly.

01:12:59.209 --> 01:13:00.249
Holly!

01:13:05.131 --> 01:13:06.671
Holly.

01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:14.810
Come back as soon as I can.

01:13:27.112 --> 01:13:30.032
- Oh.
- Seth.

01:13:30.198 --> 01:13:32.078
This is Detective Meara.

01:13:32.242 --> 01:13:33.992
Something wrong?

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:36.080
Is there
somewhere we can talk?

01:13:37.163 --> 01:13:39.623
So you work with Nathan, yeah?

01:13:39.791 --> 01:13:41.631
Yes.

01:13:41.793 --> 01:13:43.803
When's the last time
you saw him?

01:13:43.962 --> 01:13:46.422
Wednesday, I think.
Wednesday evening.

01:13:46.589 --> 01:13:49.929
Yeah, he asked me to cover the front
while he ran some errands.

01:13:50.093 --> 01:13:52.433
- What kind of errands?
- Um, he... he didn't say.

01:13:53.471 --> 01:13:56.851
Uh-huh. And this would be
about... what time?

01:13:58.184 --> 01:14:00.444
9:00, 10:00. Something like that.

01:14:01.688 --> 01:14:04.228
- He leave out through the front?
- Yeah.

01:14:04.399 --> 01:14:06.649
The front door? You sure?

01:14:06.818 --> 01:14:08.238
Yeah. Why?

01:14:08.403 --> 01:14:10.323
Well, here's the thing. Um...

01:14:10.488 --> 01:14:13.618
The front door operates
on a keyless entry system.

01:14:13.783 --> 01:14:18.003
As you know,
it records each instance in or out.

01:14:18.163 --> 01:14:21.083
Now, you want to guess the last time
someone opened that door?

01:14:22.750 --> 01:14:25.880
- Four. That's 4am.
- Oh.

01:14:26.045 --> 01:14:28.085
And you said it was,
what, 9pm or 10pm?

01:14:28.256 --> 01:14:29.736
That's kind of weird,
don't you think?

01:14:29.799 --> 01:14:31.469
Maybe I'm
remembering it wrong.

01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:34.354
He could have left out the side door,
loading docks.

01:14:34.512 --> 01:14:36.762
Loading docks?

01:14:36.931 --> 01:14:40.481
Oh, shit. Yeah. I should check that out.

01:14:42.604 --> 01:14:44.024
You and Nathan friends?

01:14:44.189 --> 01:14:46.939
Well, we worked together.
He was a nice guy and all.

01:14:47.108 --> 01:14:48.818
- Till he tried to get you fired.
- What?

01:14:48.985 --> 01:14:51.905
Oh. That is not what happened.
Nate and I were friends.

01:14:52.071 --> 01:14:56.411
Oh, now you're friends again.
Or you were friends, past tense?

01:14:56.576 --> 01:14:58.326
That's the second time
you said that.

01:14:58.495 --> 01:15:00.075
Well, you know what they say.

01:15:00.246 --> 01:15:02.666
First time's confusion,
the second time's a confession.

01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:06.038
- What's this about?
- Standard procedure.

01:15:06.211 --> 01:15:08.921
So, now, he asked you
to cover for him,

01:15:09.088 --> 01:15:11.378
this is, what, Wednesday night,
9:00 or 10:00?

01:15:11.549 --> 01:15:14.049
- Say where he was going?
- Think he had to meet someone.

01:15:14.219 --> 01:15:16.349
He got a phone call, something.

01:15:16.513 --> 01:15:18.933
It's funny, because
the first thing we did...

01:15:20.058 --> 01:15:21.638
..was check the phone records.

01:15:21.809 --> 01:15:24.479
And the last person he talked to
was his girlfriend.

01:15:25.522 --> 01:15:27.652
5:32 that afternoon.

01:16:28.084 --> 01:16:29.634
Hi.

01:16:35.508 --> 01:16:37.218
Gotta eat something.

01:16:42.432 --> 01:16:45.232
Holly. Come on.

01:16:48.479 --> 01:16:50.019
Come on.

01:16:51.065 --> 01:16:52.855
Come on. Don't do this.

01:17:19.969 --> 01:17:22.219
Now, I know what you're doing.

01:17:23.556 --> 01:17:25.216
It's not gonna work.

01:17:28.186 --> 01:17:29.846
Just talk to me.

01:17:30.021 --> 01:17:31.651
Please.

01:17:37.779 --> 01:17:39.659
It's over, Seth.

01:17:41.866 --> 01:17:44.156
I don't understand.

01:17:45.411 --> 01:17:48.411
Because if you can't help me,

01:17:48.581 --> 01:17:52.341
if you can't give me what I need,
then no-one can.

01:17:54.128 --> 01:17:57.628
Tell me. Tell me what you need.

01:18:00.093 --> 01:18:01.893
You know the answer.

01:18:02.970 --> 01:18:04.850
You put me in a box.

01:18:06.599 --> 01:18:09.229
That's not love. That's ownership.

01:18:13.106 --> 01:18:16.066
You didn't give me anything.

01:18:18.277 --> 01:18:20.987
All you did was take.

01:18:21.155 --> 01:18:23.655
I can't let you out.

01:18:23.825 --> 01:18:27.325
- You know that.
- Didn't ask you to.

01:18:27.495 --> 01:18:30.075
Then what? What do you want?

01:18:35.712 --> 01:18:37.342
Proof.

01:18:39.632 --> 01:18:41.512
Proof?

01:18:42.927 --> 01:18:44.637
A finger.

01:18:44.804 --> 01:18:46.144
A what? A f...

01:18:46.305 --> 01:18:47.805
A finger?

01:18:50.101 --> 01:18:52.651
My finger?

01:18:59.235 --> 01:19:02.405
No. No. No.

01:19:02.572 --> 01:19:04.912
No. No.

01:19:05.074 --> 01:19:06.584
This is fucked.

01:19:06.743 --> 01:19:08.793
Can't you see that?

01:19:08.953 --> 01:19:11.003
This is totally fucked.

01:19:12.498 --> 01:19:15.668
No. I'm trying to save you here.

01:19:15.835 --> 01:19:17.745
And I'm trying to let you.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.010
Well, you can't
ask me for that, Holly.

01:19:20.173 --> 01:19:22.133
And I'm not gonna do it.

01:19:25.720 --> 01:19:28.260
I used to think
I was the only one.

01:19:30.516 --> 01:19:32.886
Even when I was a kid,
I still knew...

01:19:34.187 --> 01:19:37.817
..that if they ever found out,
my family, my friends...

01:19:39.567 --> 01:19:42.857
..if they knew what I really was,
they'd run the other way.

01:19:47.033 --> 01:19:49.163
And so you learn to...

01:19:51.954 --> 01:19:54.254
..blend in, to fake it.

01:19:57.668 --> 01:19:59.208
After a while, you...

01:20:00.755 --> 01:20:04.045
..you don't even notice
how lonely you really are.

01:20:10.097 --> 01:20:11.637
But then...

01:20:14.769 --> 01:20:16.729
..someone comes along,

01:20:16.896 --> 01:20:18.516
someone like you.

01:20:22.026 --> 01:20:25.066
Even if he just doesn't know it yet.

01:20:27.240 --> 01:20:31.290
And all of a sudden, you start thinking...

01:20:33.246 --> 01:20:35.826
..maybe it doesn't have to be this way.

01:20:37.875 --> 01:20:40.455
Maybe I don't have to be alone.

01:20:41.587 --> 01:20:43.967
And so you let go of the rope.

01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:50.296
Because this person,
he's not gonna let you fall.

01:20:50.471 --> 01:20:52.681
He's gonna catch you. You know it.

01:20:58.312 --> 01:21:00.942
At least, that's what
you keep telling yourself.

01:21:03.025 --> 01:21:05.315
The whole way down.

01:21:24.046 --> 01:21:26.166
Don't come back.

01:21:28.175 --> 01:21:31.295
If that's all I am to you,
if I'm just a pet...

01:21:33.764 --> 01:21:35.604
..then don't come back for me.

01:21:36.851 --> 01:21:38.521
Don't come back for me.

01:24:11.756 --> 01:24:14.966
If I do this for you,

01:24:15.134 --> 01:24:17.554
then you'll believe?

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:19.680
Yes.

01:24:33.527 --> 01:24:35.277
This is wrong.

01:24:35.446 --> 01:24:37.276
Seth, you love me.

01:24:37.448 --> 01:24:39.908
There's nothing more right than that.

01:24:53.464 --> 01:24:54.804
Arggh!

01:24:54.965 --> 01:24:56.835
You're almost there.

01:25:08.521 --> 01:25:10.521
Open the door.

01:25:11.732 --> 01:25:14.282
- What are you doing?
- Open the fucking door!

01:25:14.443 --> 01:25:16.323
You're already
down a finger, Seth.

01:25:16.487 --> 01:25:18.067
How much more
are you ready to lose?

01:25:34.797 --> 01:25:36.417
Get back!

01:26:04.493 --> 01:26:05.543
Holly.

01:26:07.163 --> 01:26:10.213
Holly. Wait. What are you doing?

01:26:10.374 --> 01:26:13.214
Shh.

01:26:22.011 --> 01:26:23.601
I believe you.

01:26:27.016 --> 01:26:30.226
You do?

01:26:34.148 --> 01:26:35.688
Do you?

01:26:41.280 --> 01:26:43.240
You saved me, Seth.

01:26:45.534 --> 01:26:47.494
Of course I love you.

01:27:02.384 --> 01:27:05.054
But you know what that means.

01:27:15.481 --> 01:27:16.861
Holly.

01:27:17.983 --> 01:27:19.743
Don't leave me.

01:27:37.461 --> 01:27:40.091
Oh, God! Oh!

01:28:01.777 --> 01:28:03.987
You've been
working on these pieces for years.

01:28:04.154 --> 01:28:06.204
I know.
I'm not saying I'm not excited.

01:28:06.365 --> 01:28:08.235
It's, like, great
to get that call. I just...

01:28:08.409 --> 01:28:10.119
Figured you'd be
more psyched about this.

01:28:10.286 --> 01:28:12.326
It's a big deal, getting published.

01:28:12.496 --> 01:28:15.116
It's just a vanity press.
It's not exactly the 'New Yorker'.

01:28:15.291 --> 01:28:17.251
Screw that. It's still awesome.

01:28:17.418 --> 01:28:18.788
I'm proud of you.

01:28:18.961 --> 01:28:20.551
I thought you didn't even
like my story.

01:28:20.713 --> 01:28:22.553
I like you.

01:28:25.676 --> 01:28:28.756
- Babe, can you grab my phone?
- Yeah.

01:28:28.929 --> 01:28:31.809
..<i>Panthers as they're
making their way across the field.</i>

01:28:31.974 --> 01:28:34.604
<i>A good start
to their first possession tonight.</i>

01:28:34.768 --> 01:28:36.848
<i>You ain't kidding.</i>

01:28:37.021 --> 01:28:39.021
<i>Number 40...</i>

01:28:40.065 --> 01:28:41.815
<i>Chavez takes the snap,</i>

01:28:41.984 --> 01:28:46.664
<i>fakes the hands-off, right there in front
of him, one man to beat, can't beat him.</i>

01:28:46.822 --> 01:28:50.622
<i>It's taken down at the 4-yard line.</i>

01:28:51.744 --> 01:28:54.334
<i>But it looks like it's enough
for a first down.</i>

01:28:54.496 --> 01:28:56.706
<i>And Chapman
keeps this possession going.</i>

01:28:56.874 --> 01:29:00.134
<i>Really short drive after the fumble. And...</i>

01:29:00.294 --> 01:29:02.884
<i>Just a great play.
Unable to get around that defender.</i>

01:29:03.047 --> 01:29:05.297
<i>Colin Spencer, once again,
involved in that tackle.</i>

01:29:09.553 --> 01:29:12.223
- Here you go.
- Thank you, babe.

01:29:51.762 --> 01:29:53.312
Hi.

01:29:57.393 --> 01:30:00.693
I had another bad day
with Eric.

01:30:00.854 --> 01:30:03.274
He's still fooling around with other girls.

01:30:03.440 --> 01:30:07.190
This morning, I almost... hurt him.

01:30:09.488 --> 01:30:11.368
But then I thought of you.

01:30:18.956 --> 01:30:21.206
And how much you love me.

01:30:24.336 --> 01:30:26.336
And what you're doing for me.

01:30:29.550 --> 01:30:31.640
Then I felt better.
