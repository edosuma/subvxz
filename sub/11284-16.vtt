37:17.936 --> 37:19.002
AND I... (SIGHS)

37:20.672 --> 37:22.572
I'M SORRY, CHARLIE.

37:22.574 --> 37:24.641
I'M SO, SO SORRY.

37:31.583 --> 37:32.649
I KNOW,

37:37.789 --> 37:40.590
BUT THAT'S NOT
WHAT I NEED.

37:58.677 --> 37:59.743
I DID IT.

38:02.381 --> 38:03.747
I PUSHED THAT KID.

38:06.985 --> 38:08.318
I KILLED HIM.

38:29.941 --> 38:31.741
IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE,
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

38:36.415 --> 38:37.480
HEY.

38:39.451 --> 38:40.517
OH...

38:46.425 --> 38:47.824
THANK YOU.

38:48.894 --> 38:50.894
FOR THE WORDS.

38:50.896 --> 38:53.763
YOU'RE WELCOME,
CHARLIE.

38:53.765 --> 38:58.835
¶ Everybody says they're sorry ¶

39:00.105 --> 39:01.771
I LOVE YOU.

39:02.874 --> 39:04.474
I LOVE YOU.

39:05.410 --> 39:08.545
¶ 'Cause nobody knows
the story ¶

39:10.415 --> 39:13.850
¶ The recipe of life ¶

39:15.454 --> 39:16.786
TODAY'S NOT GONNA WIN HIM
ANY POINTS

39:16.788 --> 39:18.421
WITH THE AUTHORITIES.

39:18.423 --> 39:20.023
NO, NO.

39:20.025 --> 39:21.725
BUT HE WAS INNOCENT,

39:21.727 --> 39:23.560
AND HE SHOWED
A STRONG MORAL CODE

39:23.562 --> 39:25.762
AND THAT COUNTS FOR A LOT.

39:25.764 --> 39:27.748
I'LL TALK TO LAVERY.

39:27.749 --> 39:29.733
MAYBE A CRIMINAL INSTITUTION
ISN'T THE BEST PLACE FOR HIM.

39:29.735 --> 39:30.834
CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT?

39:30.836 --> 39:32.635
IT'S GONNA MAKE
A WORLD OF DIFFERENCE.

39:32.637 --> 39:35.138
BE NICE TO GET SOMEONE
OUT OF PRISON FOR A CHANGE.

39:41.947 --> 39:44.914
HEY. HEY,
THAT WAS GOOD WORK.

39:44.916 --> 39:45.949
AND, UH, THANKS

39:45.950 --> 39:46.983
FOR LETTING ME KNOW
ABOUT SPIKE.

39:46.985 --> 39:48.151
I'M GONNA TALK TO HIM.

39:48.153 --> 39:49.853
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

39:49.855 --> 39:50.854
YOU'RE GONNA GO HOME,

39:50.856 --> 39:52.522
YOU'RE GONNA PUT
YOUR FEET UP.

39:52.524 --> 39:53.823
BUDDY, YOU GOT TOO MUCH
ON YOUR PLATE.

39:53.825 --> 39:55.325
E HELP YOU OUT HERE.
EDDIE,

39:55.326 --> 39:56.826
YOU'RE WORRYING ABOUT ME.
YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY.

39:56.828 --> 39:58.261
YOU KNOW WHY?
YOU USED TO SAY THAT

39:58.262 --> 39:59.695
WHEN YOU HAD A DATE
WITH A BOTTLE OF SCOTCH.

39:59.698 --> 40:02.599
SO GO HOME.
I'LL FILE THE REPORT.

40:03.602 --> 40:05.735
I'LL TAKE THAT AS A YES.
GO ON.

40:05.737 --> 40:06.803
OKAY.

40:07.973 --> 40:09.406
THANKS, EDDIE.

40:15.447 --> 40:19.449
¶ They say oh-oh ¶

40:19.451 --> 40:22.819
¶ Whose side are you on? ¶

40:24.723 --> 40:26.523
HEY, YEAH,
THIS IS MIKE SCARLATTI.

40:26.525 --> 40:27.690
YEAH, I'M CALLING
ABOUT THE WINE KIT.

40:27.692 --> 40:29.793
I GOT IT RIGHT HERE,
SO I JUST GOTTA-

40:29.795 --> 40:31.111
WHAT'RE YOU DOING?

40:31.112 --> 40:32.428
HEY, SORRY TO INTERRUPT.
THIS IS EDWARD LANE.

40:32.431 --> 40:35.131
I'M MR. SCARLATTI'S
WINE REPRESENTATIVE.

40:35.133 --> 40:37.066
<i> I'M SORRY TO TELL YOU</i>
<i> THAT WE GOT A BETTER OFFER,</i>

40:37.068 --> 40:39.869
SO, UH, THANK YOU,
AND YOU HAVE A GREAT DAY.

40:40.972 --> 40:42.038
DONE.

40:42.974 --> 40:44.707
<i> JUST LIKE THAT.</i>

40:44.709 --> 40:45.775
WE WERE THINKING MAYBE
YOU SHOULDN'T SELL THIS STUFF,

40:45.777 --> 40:47.221
SPIKE.

40:47.222 --> 40:48.666
RAF:
YOU DON'T WANNA WASTE IT ON
A GUY WHO WON'T APPRECIATE IT.

40:48.667 --> 40:50.111
ED:
BUDDY, COME ON,
WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE

40:50.115 --> 40:51.448
A COUPLE BOTTLES OF THIS STUFF.

40:51.450 --> 40:52.682
<i> IT'S GONNA BE GREAT.</i>

40:52.684 --> 40:53.683
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

40:53.685 --> 40:55.618
I'M MORE OF A BEER GUY,
MYSELF.

40:55.620 --> 40:56.786
CHRISTMAS PRESENTS,
SAM.

40:56.788 --> 40:58.455
MM-HM.
RIGHT?

41:01.760 --> 41:02.926
I'LL CATCH UP
WITH YOU GUYS.

41:02.928 --> 41:05.379
SAM:
ALL RIGHT.

41:05.380 --> 41:07.831
MARINA:
IT CAN BE THE STRANGEST THINGS
SOMETIMES.

41:07.833 --> 41:09.165
LIKE...

41:09.167 --> 41:10.867
I SEE RED ROSES,

41:10.869 --> 41:14.103
AND I SEE THE ROSE
AND I SEE HIS FACE AGAIN.

41:14.105 --> 41:15.839
TRIGGERS.

41:15.841 --> 41:18.107
TRIGGERS CAN BE ANYTHING.

41:18.109 --> 41:21.744
IT COULD TAKE A LONG TIME,
BUT THAT IS NORMAL.

41:23.748 --> 41:25.215
THANKS.
YEAH.

41:25.217 --> 41:28.685
¶ I've asked for forgiveness ¶

41:28.687 --> 41:30.520
¶ I try being right ¶

41:31.256 --> 41:33.823
¶ I've lied wide awake ¶

41:33.825 --> 41:36.693
¶ Under the weight
of the night ¶

41:37.629 --> 41:39.696
¶ My heartache grows harder ¶

41:40.632 --> 41:43.800
¶ Till you decide it's time ¶

41:44.736 --> 41:46.002
MARINA:
PARMESAN.

41:50.609 --> 41:52.075
THERE YOU ARE.

41:52.077 --> 41:54.744
¶ If anybody says
they're sorry ¶

41:56.681 --> 42:00.884
¶ Could you easy up
their way ¶

42:03.922 --> 42:07.957
¶ Nobody wants their story ¶

42:08.894 --> 42:12.762
¶ Tell them they're okay ¶
