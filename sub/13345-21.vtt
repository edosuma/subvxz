WEBVTT

00:06.107 --> 00:08.542
( melancholy music playing )

01:08.969 --> 01:11.139
( door opens )

02:48.902 --> 02:50.804
( door opens )

02:51.939 --> 02:54.208
HELLO, MIA.

02:54.308 --> 02:56.977
PAUL, ARE YOU
ALL RIGHT?

02:57.077 --> 02:59.613
YEAH, I'M-- I'M FINE.

03:00.981 --> 03:04.585
I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT YOUR FATHER.

03:07.821 --> 03:09.923
UH, THANK YOU.

03:13.160 --> 03:15.463
( theme music playing )

03:33.213 --> 03:36.284
I FOUND OUT
FROM ELLIS AT WORK.

03:38.151 --> 03:41.489
- HOW ARE YOU?
- I'M-- I'M FINE.

03:43.090 --> 03:45.326
YOU CAN'T
REALLY BE FINE.

03:47.194 --> 03:49.797
I KNOW THAT
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO TALK TO YOUR LAWYER,

03:49.897 --> 03:53.233
BUT YOU NEVER CANCELED
ON ME BEFORE.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.204
WELL, SOME THINGS ARE
BIGGER THAN PROTOCOL,
AREN'T THEY?

03:57.305 --> 03:59.740
I MEAN,
LIFE AND DEATH,

03:59.840 --> 04:01.942
AND LOSING A FATHER.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.350
PAUL?

04:11.118 --> 04:12.586
SORRY.

04:12.686 --> 04:15.222
IT'S IRONIC THAT
WE WERE TALKING

04:15.323 --> 04:17.458
ABOUT YOUR FATHER
LAST SESSION.

04:17.558 --> 04:19.059
YEAH.

04:19.159 --> 04:21.094
I'VE THOUGHT
ABOUT THAT.

04:21.194 --> 04:25.566
YOU KNOW, THE STRANGE THING
IS I HAVEN'T SPOKEN
TO HIM SINCE THEN.

04:25.666 --> 04:29.102
BUT I CAN'T IMAGINE
WHAT I WOULD DO IF...

04:29.202 --> 04:31.439
MM-HMM.
I'M SORRY.

04:31.539 --> 04:34.508
THIS-- THIS IS NOT
ABOUT ME TODAY.

04:35.476 --> 04:37.210
DID YOU GET MY CARD?

04:37.311 --> 04:41.048
I STOOD
IN THAT STORE FOREVER

04:41.148 --> 04:42.450
TRYING TO PICK
IT OUT, YOU KNOW?

04:42.550 --> 04:45.353
WHAT KIND OF PICTURE?
WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE?

04:45.453 --> 04:49.289
- WHAT DID YOU THINK?
- I HAVEN'T READ IT YET.

04:49.390 --> 04:52.460
- BECAUSE I SENT IT?
- NO NO NO NO NO.

04:55.363 --> 04:57.365
YOU WERE AWAY
ALL LAST WEEK

04:57.465 --> 04:59.367
AND YOU HAVEN'T
OPENED YOUR MAIL?

04:59.467 --> 05:01.234
- THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN.
- ( chuckles )

05:01.335 --> 05:04.505
SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE
WORRIED ABOUT ME.

05:04.605 --> 05:07.107
WELL, YOU DO LOOK TIRED

05:07.207 --> 05:09.810
AND YOU'RE NOT
WEARING A JACKET.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.745
OH. YEAH.

05:12.946 --> 05:15.749
ARE YOU SLEEPING?

05:15.849 --> 05:18.519
- ARE YOU EATING?
- NO, I'M FINE.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.921
YEAH, YOU SAID
THAT BEFORE.

05:21.021 --> 05:23.657
I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE
TO BE THE NEUTRAL SHRINK,

05:23.757 --> 05:25.893
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THIS IS A RELATIONSHIP

05:25.993 --> 05:27.895
OF A SORT, ISN'T IT?

05:27.995 --> 05:30.097
YES, IT IS.

05:32.500 --> 05:35.202
AND I APPRECIATE
YOUR SYMPATHY.

05:35.302 --> 05:40.574
GRANTED, I AM NOT
THE FIRST PERSON
YOU WOULD REACH OUT TO.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.310
OUR LAST COUPLE
OF SESSIONS, I HAVE BEEN...

05:43.411 --> 05:46.013
A CHALLENGE
TO PUT IT MILDLY.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.382
BUT I WAS CONCERNED.

05:48.482 --> 05:50.283
I WONDERED
WHO DO YOU HAVE?

05:50.384 --> 05:51.952
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE
CLOSE TO YOUR EX.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.488
I ASSUME YOUR
KIDS ARE WITH HER.
YOU HAVEN'T BEEN

05:54.588 --> 05:56.690
IN NEW YORK
THAT LONG AND IT'S
HARD TO FIND FRIENDS.

05:56.790 --> 05:59.593
WELL, ARE YOU
WORRIED I'M LONELY?
( chuckles )

05:59.693 --> 06:02.463
NO OFFENSE,
BUT I CAN SEE IT
IN YOUR FACE.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.935
( inhales deeply )

06:10.704 --> 06:14.207
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT
YOU'RE AFRAID I'M NOT READY

06:14.307 --> 06:16.944
TO GIVE YOU
MY FULL ATTENTION TODAY?

06:17.044 --> 06:19.279
NO. NO, THAT'S NOT IT.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.416
I MEAN, THIS IS
ME BEING CARING.
IS THAT OKAY?

06:22.516 --> 06:26.086
YEAH, OF COURSE IT IS.
IT'S JUST IT'S NOT WHAT YOU...

06:27.655 --> 06:29.890
LOOK, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY

06:29.990 --> 06:33.661
- ABOUT MY FEELINGS.
- DOES ANYBODY?

06:33.761 --> 06:35.763
WOULD YOU RATHER I YELL
AT YOU FOR CANCELING?

06:35.863 --> 06:39.366
- ARE YOU SAYING YOU FELT LIKE
YELLING WHEN I CANCELED?
- ( scoffs )

06:39.467 --> 06:41.702
- IT WAS FINE.
- NO OTHER REACTION?

06:41.802 --> 06:45.338
- I GOT OVER IT.
- BEFORE OR AFTER
YOU HAD SEEN ELLIS?

06:45.439 --> 06:49.176
OKAY, TRUE,
I WENT TO ELLIS.

06:49.276 --> 06:51.078
ALSO TRUE I WAS
A LITTLE UPSET--

06:51.178 --> 06:53.213
MORE THAN A LITTLE.

06:53.313 --> 06:55.315
AND THEN
I FELT LIKE A JERK

06:55.415 --> 06:57.551
WHEN I FOUND OUT
WHY YOU HAD CANCELED.

07:01.421 --> 07:04.257
BUT THAT WAS
LAST WEEK,

07:04.357 --> 07:06.960
AND NOW
EVERYTHING'S CHANGED.

07:07.060 --> 07:10.631
OH? WHY IS THAT?

07:12.733 --> 07:15.135
BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT.

07:25.513 --> 07:27.781
- OH, THAT'S--
- ( giggles )

07:27.881 --> 07:30.350
--THAT'S REALLY

07:30.450 --> 07:33.286
BIG NEWS.

07:33.386 --> 07:35.523
NO KIDDING.

07:37.190 --> 07:40.661
- ARE YOU SURPRISED?
- YES.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.330
YEAH, ME TOO,

07:43.430 --> 07:48.301
ESPECIALLY
WITH MY F.S.H. LEVELS.

07:48.401 --> 07:52.573
IT'S STRANGE TIMING
WITH US--

07:52.673 --> 07:55.509
LIFE AND DEATH.

08:10.223 --> 08:12.626
DO YOU WANNA HAVE
THE SESSION OUT
IN THE SNOW?

08:12.726 --> 08:15.596
- I MEAN--
- OH, UH...

08:15.696 --> 08:17.831
SORRY.
YOU WERE TELLING ME

08:17.931 --> 08:20.968
ABOUT YOUR
F.S.H. LEVELS.

08:21.068 --> 08:22.469
NO, WE WERE PAST THAT.

08:22.570 --> 08:25.505
I WAS TALKING
ABOUT OUR TIMING.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.910
20 YEARS AGO
YOU WERE HAVING

08:30.010 --> 08:31.979
YOUR FIRST CHILD
AND I WAS LOSING MINE.

08:32.079 --> 08:35.683
YEAH. SO HAVE YOU BEEN
THINKING ABOUT THAT TIME?

08:35.783 --> 08:37.685
IT'S DIFFERENT.
IT'S DIFFERENT THIS TIME.

08:37.785 --> 08:40.554
I KNOW EVERYBODY
SAYS YOU GET PREGNANT
AND EVERYTHING CHANGES,

08:40.654 --> 08:41.822
BUT IT'S REALLY TRUE.

08:41.922 --> 08:44.191
I MEAN, MY BODY FEELS
TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

08:44.291 --> 08:47.094
I'VE STOPPED SMOKING,
YOU KNOW?

08:47.194 --> 08:49.730
THERE'S-- THERE'S
THIS PRESCHOOL ON MY BLOCK

08:49.830 --> 08:51.431
THAT I ALWAYS AVOID

08:51.531 --> 08:53.200
BECAUSE IT'S MOMS

08:53.300 --> 08:55.435
WITH THEIR
HUMVEE STROLLERS

08:55.535 --> 08:56.937
BLOCKING EVERYONE,

08:57.037 --> 08:59.439
LIKE THEY'RE PRIVILEGED
BECAUSE THEY PROCREATED.

08:59.539 --> 09:03.143
NOW I JUST WALK
THROUGH SMILING.

09:03.243 --> 09:06.279
SO YOU WENT
FROM JEALOUSY

09:06.379 --> 09:09.983
TO FEELING LIKE
PART OF THE CLUB.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.853
AT WORK, BENNETT--

09:12.953 --> 09:15.122
WHO'S LEAVING FRIDAY,
FINALLY--

09:15.222 --> 09:17.524
HE HAD ASKED ME
TO TAKE OVER THIS BIG CASE,

09:17.625 --> 09:20.828
YOU KNOW, ASSUMING
THAT I WOULD JUST CRUSH
THE OTHER SIDE AS USUAL.

09:20.928 --> 09:22.863
BUT I TOOK ONE LOOK
AT THE POOR FAMILY

09:22.963 --> 09:25.065
AND I CUT A DEAL.
HE WAS PISSED.

09:25.165 --> 09:28.902
MMM. YOU'RE SURE
YOU'RE NOT TRYING

09:29.002 --> 09:32.205
- TO PUNISH BENNETT?
- HE'S MARRYING STEFANIE.

09:32.305 --> 09:34.341
THAT'LL BE
PUNISHMENT ENOUGH.

09:34.441 --> 09:35.976
I FEEL BAD
FOR THEIR KID, YOU KNOW?

09:36.076 --> 09:38.311
I MEAN,
HE'S A DOUBLE ADULTERER
AND SHE'S A BIMBO.

09:41.148 --> 09:44.785
- WHY ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT BENNETT?
- WELL, YOU BROUGHT HIM UP.

09:44.885 --> 09:48.021
AND HE IS SOMEBODY
THAT YOU DID WANT
TO HAVE A CHILD WITH.

09:48.121 --> 09:49.690
IT'S-- IT'S NOT HIS.

09:49.790 --> 09:51.792
I DID THE MATH.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.894
STILL, IT'S INTERESTING
THAT YOU FOUND OUT

09:53.994 --> 09:55.829
THAT BENNETT WAS
HAVING A BABY

09:55.929 --> 09:58.932
AND A COUPLE
OF WEEKS LATER
YOU'RE PREGNANT.

09:59.032 --> 10:01.368
ARE YOU SAYING
THAT I'M COMPETING
WITH BENNETT?

10:01.468 --> 10:04.471
THAT'S WHAT
YOU THINK I THINK?

10:04.571 --> 10:06.106
"THAT'S WHAT
YOU THINK I THINK"?

10:06.206 --> 10:08.441
PAUL, I'M HAVING
A BABY

10:08.541 --> 10:09.943
BECAUSE I WENT
ON A SEX SPREE

10:10.043 --> 10:12.279
THAT WEEKEND
WITHOUT USING
PROTECTION.

10:12.379 --> 10:15.448
MAYBE THAT WASN'T
THE SMARTEST THING
BUT MAYBE IT WAS.

10:15.548 --> 10:18.151
SO MAYBE YOU WEREN'T
JUST BEING RECKLESS.

10:18.251 --> 10:22.355
MAYBE YOU MIGHT
HAVE BEEN TRYING
TO GET PREGNANT.

10:22.455 --> 10:26.326
I FIGURE IT WAS GUITAR BOY
AND NOT THE MIDDLE-AGED COP,

10:26.426 --> 10:28.261
WHICH IS GOOD,

10:28.361 --> 10:31.498
BECAUSE THERE WON'T
BE ANY PATERNITY ISSUES
IF I DECIDE NOT TO TELL.

10:31.598 --> 10:35.302
GUITAR BOY DOESN'T
EVEN HAVE MY NUMBER
OR MY LAST NAME.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.804
SO YOU DON'T
WANT HIM INVOLVED?

10:36.904 --> 10:38.638
I KNOW THE BABY
NEEDS A FATHER,

10:38.739 --> 10:41.041
BUT NOT ONE
LIKE THAT.

10:46.613 --> 10:50.650
DOES THIS SILENCE
MEAN YOU'RE APPALLED?

10:52.853 --> 10:54.988
HEY, I'M PREGNANT.

10:56.589 --> 10:58.491
I THOUGHT THAT

10:58.591 --> 11:00.627
YOU WOULD BE HAPPY,

11:00.728 --> 11:02.730
THAT WE'D CELEBRATE.

11:03.897 --> 11:06.333
THIS IS REALLY
BAD TIMING. I KNOW.

11:09.970 --> 11:12.339
WHAT WOULD YOU
LIKE ME TO SAY, MIA?

11:14.141 --> 11:17.711
"WOW, MIA!
THAT'S AMAZING!

11:17.811 --> 11:20.180
YOU CAME IN HERE
SAYING YOU WANTED
A FAMILY, A CHILD,

11:20.280 --> 11:22.349
AND THEN YOU GOT IT.
CONGRATULATIONS."

11:22.449 --> 11:24.885
IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU HAD A PROBLEM AND NOW
YOU HAVE A SOLUTION?

11:24.985 --> 11:26.820
WELL, CAN'T THAT
HAPPEN EVER?

11:26.920 --> 11:28.188
OF COURSE.
IT SOUNDS IDEAL.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.257
WHAT ELSE WOULD YOU
LIKE TO HEAR FROM ME?

11:30.357 --> 11:31.959
THIS GAME AGAIN? OKAY.

11:32.059 --> 11:33.927
HOW ABOUT
"DON'T WORRY.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.997
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
A GOOD MOM AND I'LL
BE THERE FOR YOU."

11:37.097 --> 11:38.698
COULD YOU TELL ME
WHAT THAT MEANS,

11:38.799 --> 11:40.333
"I'LL BE THERE FOR YOU"?

11:40.433 --> 11:42.069
I HAVE MAJOR DECISIONS
TO MAKE.

11:42.169 --> 11:45.072
- LIKE WHAT?
- LIKE DO I NEED A DOULA?

11:45.172 --> 11:47.007
SHOULD I HAVE
GENETIC TESTING?

11:47.107 --> 11:48.976
WILL MY APARTMENT
BE BIG ENOUGH?

11:49.076 --> 11:51.178
AND YOU WANT ME TO HELP YOU
WITH THOSE DECISIONS?

11:51.278 --> 11:52.746
HOW MUCH TIME
SHOULD I TAKE OFF?

11:52.846 --> 11:54.948
OR SHOULD I JUST QUIT
AND MOVE TO THE COUNTRY?

11:55.048 --> 11:57.284
THESE ARE
ALL BIG QUESTIONS.

11:57.384 --> 12:00.087
YOUR SISTERS HAVE CHILDREN.
HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO THEM?

12:00.187 --> 12:02.622
THEY'RE BUSY
WITH THEIR OWN KIDS.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.825
AND MY MOTHER?
FORGET IT.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.896
AND MY DAD, HE LOVES
HIS GRANDCHILDREN,

12:08.996 --> 12:12.966
BUT HE DOESN'T
DO ANYTHING.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.202
HE JUST LETS THEM
ADMIRE HIM.

12:15.302 --> 12:18.371
YOU SOUND SURE THAT
YOUR MOTHER WOULDN'T
WANT TO HELP YOU,

12:18.471 --> 12:20.473
BUT SHE DID
WITH YOUR SISTERS.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.476
THAT'S DIFFERENT--
THEY'RE YOUNGER,
THEY'RE MARRIED...

12:25.412 --> 12:27.247
AND SHE ACTUALLY
LIKES THEM.

12:27.347 --> 12:30.483
- AND SHE DOESN'T LIKE YOU?
- FOR ME SHE WAS LESS
OF A MOM

12:30.583 --> 12:32.585
AND MORE OF A VASE--

12:32.685 --> 12:34.955
BEAUTIFUL, BUT HARD
TO THE TOUCH.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.890
THAT'S A VERY
POWERFUL IMAGE.

12:36.990 --> 12:39.960
SHE WAS BEAUTIFUL
UNTIL I RUINED
HER FIGURE.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.629
OH YES,
HER MANTRA.

12:42.729 --> 12:45.098
HAS THAT BEEN
ON YOUR MIND THIS WEEK?

12:45.198 --> 12:47.067
I'VE ALWAYS
KEPT IN SHAPE.

12:47.167 --> 12:49.402
I THINK MEN LIKE THAT--
AND NOW THAT'LL ALL GO.

12:49.502 --> 12:52.672
I HEAR
YOUR FEET GET BIGGER.
I HATE BIG FEET.

12:52.772 --> 12:56.776
NOT TO MENTION
WHAT BIRTH DOES TO SEX.

12:58.078 --> 12:59.847
I MEAN,
YOU'VE BEEN THERE.

12:59.947 --> 13:03.016
IT STRETCHES, RIGHT?

13:04.684 --> 13:06.586
THE SIZE
OF A BABY'S HEAD

13:06.686 --> 13:08.288
COMPARED TO THE SIZE
OF A PENIS?

13:08.388 --> 13:09.957
THAT CAN'T BE GOOD.

13:10.057 --> 13:12.559
AND THE MAN THING
IS OVER, ISN'T IT?

13:12.659 --> 13:15.295
GUYS MY AGE,
THEY HAVE GROWN KIDS.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.364
THEY DON'T WANT
TO CHANGE DIAPERS AGAIN.

13:17.464 --> 13:21.268
- I MEAN, WOULD YOU?
- WHAT-- WHAT ARE
YOU ASKING ME?

13:21.368 --> 13:24.037
COME ON, PAUL,
JUST ANSWER MY QUESTION.

13:24.137 --> 13:27.875
IF SOMEONE LIKE ME
WOULD BE ATTRACTED
TO A WOMAN LIKE YOU?

13:27.975 --> 13:30.543
WE'VE ALREADY DONE THAT.
I GET IT-- WE'RE NOT A COUPLE.

13:30.643 --> 13:33.914
I'M SAYING
HYPOTHETICALLY

13:34.014 --> 13:37.284
IF I GOT FAT,
EMOTIONAL--

13:37.384 --> 13:39.619
MORE EMOTIONAL--

13:39.719 --> 13:42.055
IF I HAD TO CATER
TO AN INFANT--

13:42.155 --> 13:44.124
I DON'T THINK THAT
RULES OUT ALL MEN.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.994
SO I COULD STILL GET
THE DROOLING GUY ON THE BACK
OF THE 6 TRAIN?

13:47.094 --> 13:49.629
I MEAN, LOOK,
HAVING A CHILD

13:49.729 --> 13:52.132
CAN RUIN EVEN
A GOOD RELATIONSHIP.

13:54.067 --> 13:55.969
IS THAT WHAT
HAPPENED TO YOU?

13:56.069 --> 13:58.638
YOUR WIFE DID
ALL THE CHILD-REARING

13:58.738 --> 14:01.341
WHILE YOU SAT
IN THAT CHAIR LISTENING
TO PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS?

14:01.441 --> 14:03.376
SHE ACTUALLY DEALT
WITH PEOPLE'S PROBLEMS?

14:03.476 --> 14:05.112
IT MUST'VE
PISSED HER OFF.

14:05.212 --> 14:09.282
OBVIOUSLY,
SOMETHING DID.

14:12.685 --> 14:15.822
BUT I'D RATHER
TALK ABOUT YOUR ANGER
THAN MY EX-WIFE'S.

14:15.923 --> 14:18.225
FAIR ENOUGH.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.831
WHO-- WHOSE ARE THOSE?

14:24.932 --> 14:28.201
YOURS OR YOUR KIDS?

14:31.171 --> 14:33.540
AND WHY ARE
THEY IN HERE?

14:40.948 --> 14:43.250
ARE YOU THIS RESPONSIVE
WITH YOUR KIDS

14:43.350 --> 14:45.919
OR ARE YOU DIFFERENT
AS A DAD?

14:46.019 --> 14:48.221
OH. OKAY, GREAT.
YOU'RE BORED?

14:48.321 --> 14:50.991
YOU'RE ANNOYED?
YOU CAN'T WAIT TILL
I GET OUT OF HERE?

14:51.091 --> 14:52.926
AND WE'RE BACK
TO YOUR DEFAULT--

14:53.026 --> 14:54.594
THAT I WANT
TO KICK YOU OUT.

14:54.694 --> 14:57.297
YOU DID JUST
LOOK AT YOUR WATCH.
YOU HAVE NEVER DONE THAT.

14:57.397 --> 14:59.967
- I'VE NEVER
WORN A WATCH BEFORE.
- THAT IS NOT THE POINT.

15:00.067 --> 15:02.535
I AM RIGHT.
YOU SHOULD NOT BE
WORKING THIS WEEK.

15:02.635 --> 15:05.605
- I'M FINE, MIA.
- IF I SAID "I'M FINE"
FOUR TIMES,

15:05.705 --> 15:07.207
YOU WOULD BE
ALL OVER ME.

15:07.307 --> 15:09.242
YOU'RE NOT
EVEN IN THE ROOM,
EMOTIONALLY.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.678
ADMIT IT.
WHY DID YOU LOOK
AT YOUR WATCH?

15:11.778 --> 15:14.481
IT'S MY FATHER'S WATCH.

15:16.683 --> 15:19.086
I'M SORRY.
I MUST HAVE GLANCED
WITHOUT MEANING TO

15:19.186 --> 15:23.223
WHEN YOU MENTIONED
THE WORD "DAD."

15:23.323 --> 15:25.258
OH.

15:27.027 --> 15:28.795
IT'S NOT EVEN TICKING.

15:28.895 --> 15:31.064
TIME STOPS
WHEN I'M HERE.

15:32.765 --> 15:36.603
IF I WASN'T PREGNANT,
WE COULD CALL IT A DAY
AND GO TO A BAR.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.472
- THAT WOULD BE
BETTER FOR BOTH OF US.
- IS THIS THE BAR IN SOHO

15:39.572 --> 15:41.874
WHERE YOU HOPED
WE'D RUN INTO EACH OTHER?

15:41.975 --> 15:45.212
YEAH, ALTHOUGH
THIS TIME WE COULD ACT
LIKE WE'D JUST MET.

15:45.312 --> 15:47.647
AS IN "HELLO,
IS THIS SEAT TAKEN?"

15:47.747 --> 15:51.218
- ( both chuckle )
- RIGHT. AND I'D SAY,
"NO. HI.

15:51.318 --> 15:52.885
I JUST FOUND OUT
I'M PREGNANT

15:52.986 --> 15:54.587
AFTER A BINGE WEEKEND
OF ANONYMOUS SEX."

15:54.687 --> 15:57.624
AND YOU WOULD SAY
"MY FATHER JUST DIED."

15:57.724 --> 16:00.760
THEN WE'D GET PLASTERED
AND FLY TO VEGAS
AND GET MARRIED.

16:00.860 --> 16:04.297
- AND THEN WHAT?
- OH, YOU KNOW ME,
I'D FUCK IT UP.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.466
- BUT IT WAS FUN, WASN'T IT?
- I CAN SEE HOW

16:06.566 --> 16:08.868
WE BOTH COULD THINK
IT WOULD SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.603
DON'T GO OVERBOARD.

16:12.172 --> 16:14.941
MIA, I THINK THERE'S
TWO ISSUES HERE:

16:15.042 --> 16:18.411
ONE, YOUR FEELINGS
ABOUT THE PREGNANCY;

16:18.511 --> 16:21.048
TWO, YOUR FEELINGS
ABOUT NOT HAVING A PARTNER.

16:21.148 --> 16:24.484
AND IT COULD BE
THAT THEY'RE...

16:24.584 --> 16:26.453
INTERTWINED.

16:26.553 --> 16:28.321
I MEAN, YOU'VE SAID
A FEW TIMES

16:28.421 --> 16:31.491
THAT IT FEELS LIKE I'M NOT
IN THE ROOM TODAY.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.926
YOU MENTIONED
YOU'RE WORRIED THAT
HAVING A BABY IS GONNA

16:34.027 --> 16:36.829
MAKE YOU FEEL
LESS PHYSICALLY ATTRACTIVE.

16:36.929 --> 16:40.967
IS IT THAT YOU'RE
AFRAID THAT NO ONE
WILL BE THERE FOR YOU

16:41.068 --> 16:43.370
IF YOU HAVE A CHILD?

16:43.470 --> 16:45.538
WELL, I WILL BE
A SINGLE MOM.

16:45.638 --> 16:48.041
- THAT'S HARDER.
- YES.

16:48.141 --> 16:49.542
IT CAN BE.

16:49.642 --> 16:51.911
AND OKAY, I ADMIT
IT ISN'T MY FIRST CHOICE

16:52.011 --> 16:54.481
BUT I CAN'T HAVE
MY FIRST CHOICE.

16:54.581 --> 16:57.384
THIS IS WHAT I HAVE.
IT'S NOT PICTURE PERFECT.

16:57.484 --> 16:59.586
AND WHAT'S
PICTURE PERFECT?

17:02.122 --> 17:05.225
ME, A BABY
AND A MAN.

17:05.325 --> 17:08.495
AND WHAT KIND OF MAN?

17:08.595 --> 17:10.663
- WHAT? I DON'T KNOW.
- NO IDEA?

17:10.763 --> 17:13.933
THAT'S NOT THE POINT.
WHY AREN'T YOU ENCOURAGING ME?

17:14.033 --> 17:15.435
YOU'RE IN THE MOOD
TO CELEBRATE

17:15.535 --> 17:17.404
AND YOU FEEL THAT
I'M NOT JOINING IN THAT.

17:17.504 --> 17:20.073
NO, I THINK
THAT YOU THINK

17:20.173 --> 17:22.075
THAT I'M TOO FUCKED UP,

17:22.175 --> 17:23.743
THAT I'LL BE MISERABLE

17:23.843 --> 17:26.779
- AND A DISASTER.
- YOU KNOW THAT'S
NOT WHAT I SAID.

17:26.879 --> 17:30.450
NEVER MIND. I WILL CALL
GUITAR BOY. I'M SURE HE'LL
TAKE FULL RESPONSIBILITY.

17:30.550 --> 17:33.253
OR-- OR I'LL JUST
DO IT ALL ON MY OWN.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.255
I'LL QUIT MY JOB,
I'LL GAIN 100 LBS

17:35.355 --> 17:37.524
AND I'M SURE
I'LL STILL BE AS GOOD
A MOM AS MY MOM WAS

17:37.624 --> 17:39.692
EXCEPT THAT THIS BABY
WON'T HAVE A DAD.

17:39.792 --> 17:42.562
- WHY DON'T YOU
JUST TAKE A BREATH?
- GOD, I NEED TO SMOKE.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.664
OH. YOU WON'T LET ME.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.933
I THOUGHT YOU HAD QUIT
BECAUSE YOU'RE PREGNANT.

17:47.033 --> 17:48.668
ONE CIGARETTE ISN'T
GOING TO DO ANY HARM.

17:48.768 --> 17:52.172
- I'D RATHER YOU DIDN'T.
- I'M IN WITHDRAWAL, OKAY?

17:52.272 --> 17:54.274
- I THINK
YOU'RE AGITATED.
- ( sighs )

17:54.374 --> 17:56.709
WHY DO PEOPLE HAVE
CHILDREN ANYHOW?

17:58.445 --> 18:01.181
THEY WANT LITTLE VERSIONS
OF THEMSELVES

18:01.281 --> 18:05.418
TO GAZE UP
AND SAY "I LOVE YOU"?

18:05.518 --> 18:07.420
THEY WANT TO RELIVE
THEIR OWN CHILDHOODS?

18:07.520 --> 18:09.756
THAT-- THAT IS
THE LAST THING
I WANT TO DO.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.426
THE TRUTH IS I LIKE
VISITING MY NIECES,

18:13.526 --> 18:15.462
BUT I CANNOT WAIT
TO GET HOME.

18:15.562 --> 18:17.497
YOU DON'T GIVE ME
THAT SENSE.

18:17.597 --> 18:20.133
WHAT WAS I THINKING,
SLEEPING AROUND LIKE THAT?

18:20.233 --> 18:21.368
IF I HAD WANTED
A CHILD,

18:21.468 --> 18:23.570
I WOULD'VE
HAD ONE BY NOW.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.639
MAYBE I SHOULD
GIVE IT UP FOR ADOPTION.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.107
SO...

18:28.208 --> 18:32.479
YOU DON'T WANT
TO HAVE THE BABY?

18:34.113 --> 18:36.316
I'M JUST...

18:37.384 --> 18:39.319
GO ON, MIA.
JUST TALK THROUGH IT.

18:39.419 --> 18:41.788
IT'S-- TELL ME
WHAT YOU'RE FEELING.

18:41.888 --> 18:44.090
- IT'S OKAY.
THESE FEELINGS--
- NO, SHUT UP.

18:44.191 --> 18:45.225
SHUT UP.
IT'S NOT OKAY.

18:45.325 --> 18:47.160
THIS ISN'T JUST
MY FEELINGS.

18:47.260 --> 18:49.262
THIS IS IT, RIGHT?

18:49.362 --> 18:52.299
THIS IS
MY LAST CHANCE...

18:53.233 --> 18:56.469
AND I'M--
I'M TOO SCARED?

18:56.569 --> 19:00.440
THIS SOUNDS VERY SIMILAR
TO WHAT YOU WERE SAYING
20 YEARS AGO.

19:03.109 --> 19:05.178
YOU'RE RIGHT.

19:07.547 --> 19:10.550
THIS IS JUST HOW IT FELT
BACK THEN, ISN'T IT?

19:12.885 --> 19:15.855
I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE A BABY.
I WANTED TO HAVE AN ABORTION.

19:18.124 --> 19:21.928
AND IS THAT WHAT
YOU WANT TO DO NOW?

19:24.631 --> 19:26.599
NO. I DON'T KNOW.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.603
I MEAN,
COME ON, PAUL.

19:30.703 --> 19:32.639
WE BOTH KNOW I'M--

19:32.739 --> 19:34.674
I SHOULDN'T
GO THROUGH WITH THIS.

19:34.774 --> 19:37.310
MIA, LOOK, I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU MAY BE FEELING

19:37.410 --> 19:40.613
JUST OVERWHELMED
RIGHT NOW...

19:40.713 --> 19:43.316
- YEAH, YOU THINK?
- ...BUT YOU ARE IN
A VERY DIFFERENT PLACE

19:43.416 --> 19:45.618
THAN YOU WERE BACK THEN.
SOME OF YOUR CONCERNS ARE--

19:45.718 --> 19:49.121
THEY'RE PRACTICAL.
YOU CAN HANDLE THEM NOW.

19:49.222 --> 19:50.790
YOU KNOW HOW
TO HIRE A NANNY,

19:50.890 --> 19:53.226
HOW TO BUY
A BIGGER APARTMENT,
HOW TO MAKE A LIVING.

19:53.326 --> 19:55.862
BUT MAYBE
THE REAL QUESTION IS

19:57.530 --> 20:00.633
DO YOU WANT
TO RAISE A CHILD

20:00.733 --> 20:04.537
IF YOU HAVE TO DO IT
ON YOUR OWN?

20:09.876 --> 20:11.678
WILL YOU HELP ME?

20:14.381 --> 20:17.216
I-- I CAN HELP YOU
AS YOUR THERAPIST.

20:17.317 --> 20:20.219
WELL, I KNOW,
BUT I'VE NEVER
BEEN A MOTHER

20:20.320 --> 20:22.955
- AND YOU'RE THE FATHER.
- I'M THE FATHER?

20:23.055 --> 20:26.459
N-- NO,
I MISSPOKE.

20:26.559 --> 20:29.662
YOU'RE NOT THE FATHER.
YOU'RE A FATHER.

20:29.762 --> 20:32.799
NEVERTHELESS, YOU DID
WANT US TO CELEBRATE,

20:32.899 --> 20:37.003
YOU ASKED IF
I WOULD STICK WITH YOU
IF YOU WERE PREGNANT

20:37.103 --> 20:39.839
AND THEN YOU IMAGINED
HOW WE MIGHT RUN AWAY
AND GET MARRIED.

20:39.939 --> 20:43.175
SO IF YOU'RE CREATING
A NEW FAMILY, MIA,

20:43.276 --> 20:47.146
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT
YOU'D LIKE ME TO BE THERE--

20:47.246 --> 20:49.482
IN THE PICTURE
OR IN THE ROOM.

20:52.184 --> 20:54.687
AND HERE WE ARE.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.960
AND NOW I JUST WANT YOU
TO TELL ME THAT

21:01.060 --> 21:05.197
HAVING A BABY
MEANS I WON'T BE ALONE
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

21:05.298 --> 21:07.467
( chuckles )
ACTUALLY, I CAN TELL YOU

21:07.567 --> 21:10.370
THAT IN MY EXPERIENCE
AT TIMES IT FEELS LIKE

21:10.470 --> 21:13.540
WHEN YOU HAVE A CHILD,
YOU'LL NEVER BE ALONE AGAIN,

21:13.640 --> 21:15.775
OR EVEN HAVE
A MOMENT TO YOURSELF.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.883
WHO-- WHO ELSE
HAVE YOU TOLD
ABOUT THE PREGNANCY?

21:24.951 --> 21:26.686
THIS TIME?

21:27.387 --> 21:29.188
NO ONE.

21:29.288 --> 21:32.525
EVEN AFTER
YOU TOOK THE TEST?

21:36.429 --> 21:39.632
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT, PAUL.
I DO WANT TO PULL YOU IN.

21:44.236 --> 21:46.339
OF COURSE,
YOU KNOW I--

21:46.439 --> 21:50.309
I'M SCARED.
I'M WORRIED ABOUT
DOING IT ON MY OWN.

21:53.746 --> 21:55.314
BUT I HEARD
WHAT YOU SAID.

21:55.415 --> 21:57.950
I'M NOT THE SAME PERSON
I WAS 20 YEARS AGO.

22:04.757 --> 22:07.694
THERE'S JUST
THIS NEW LIFE.

22:09.829 --> 22:11.664
I CAN FEEL IT.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.968
AND THIS TIME
I WANT IT.

22:19.372 --> 22:21.841
YOU REALLY DO.

22:26.713 --> 22:29.616
AND I'LL TRY MY BEST
TO BE A GOOD MOTHER...

22:30.650 --> 22:33.853
EVEN IF I'M AFRAID
AND EVEN IF

22:33.953 --> 22:35.888
IT'S JUST ME.

22:43.029 --> 22:46.165
I THINK MAYBE THIS IS
A GOOD PLACE TO STOP.

22:46.265 --> 22:49.101
OH. WOW,
THAT WENT FAST.

22:49.201 --> 22:52.505
IT'S OKAY.
I'D BETTER GET GOING.

22:52.605 --> 22:56.142
THE SUBWAYS ARE GOING
TO BE ALL SCREWED UP.

22:56.242 --> 22:58.310
BUT YOU--
( clears throat )

22:58.411 --> 23:00.079
YOU SHOULD TAKE
THE REST OF THE DAY OFF--

23:00.179 --> 23:02.415
A SNOW DAY.

23:02.515 --> 23:06.018
GO FOR A WALK
IN THE PARK.
EAT SOMETHING.

23:06.118 --> 23:08.855
THANK YOU.

23:10.122 --> 23:11.724
AND, PAUL...

23:13.560 --> 23:15.795
PLEASE BE HAPPY FOR ME.

23:46.759 --> 23:49.428
( theme music playing )
