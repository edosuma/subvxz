Shut it off!

01:26.460 --> 01:28.750
I told Horace
not to turn on
the vacuum

01:28.750 --> 01:30.250
till we attached the bag.

01:30.250 --> 01:32.420
How could I hear you
with the vacuum on?

01:32.420 --> 01:34.210
Jasper: You idiot.

01:35.420 --> 01:38.960
You are fired!

01:38.960 --> 01:41.670
Uh, do you mean
fired till tomorrow

01:41.670 --> 01:43.330
or fired till Tuesday?

01:43.330 --> 01:45.170
-She's kind of riled up
this time.

01:45.170 --> 01:46.830
We better stay fired
till next Thursday.

01:46.830 --> 01:49.210
I mean fired forever!

01:49.210 --> 01:51.000
You have bungled
your final bungle,

01:51.000 --> 01:52.750
and I will never
hire you again!

01:52.750 --> 01:55.000
Out! Out! Out!

01:59.170 --> 02:00.380
Oomph!

02:00.380 --> 02:01.380
Whoa!

02:06.580 --> 02:10.750
Horace:
We're in a real pickle,
Jasper, a real pickle.

02:10.750 --> 02:12.250
Got to look
on the bright side, Horace.

02:12.250 --> 02:13.620
This could
be our big chance

02:13.620 --> 02:15.920
to find a job where
we'll actually get paid

02:15.920 --> 02:16.960
with money.

02:16.960 --> 02:18.670
There's bosses who pay money?

02:18.670 --> 02:20.250
Oh, come on!

02:20.250 --> 02:22.080
How dumb
do you think I am?

02:22.080 --> 02:23.540
You'll see.

02:23.540 --> 02:24.750
Now, when we get
to the agency,

02:24.750 --> 02:25.920
let me do the talking.

02:25.920 --> 02:28.080
You just sit there
and look smart.

02:28.080 --> 02:29.210
I can do that.

02:29.210 --> 02:30.420
Hmm.

02:32.920 --> 02:34.830
Uh, keep working on it.

02:38.380 --> 02:40.750
Golly! I never interviewed
two people at once

02:40.750 --> 02:42.250
in the whole three weeks
I've been here.

02:42.250 --> 02:43.040
All righty.

02:43.040 --> 02:44.710
The first question is:

02:44.710 --> 02:46.120
what kind of work
have you done?

02:46.120 --> 02:48.670
-Mostly unpaid.

02:48.670 --> 02:50.790
H-h-he said unafraid.

02:50.790 --> 02:52.210
We are not afraid
of any work.

02:52.210 --> 02:55.330
Good, that's the attitude
I'm supposed to look for.

02:59.040 --> 03:00.500
Ha! Here's one!

03:00.500 --> 03:02.420
We need two good men
to drill for oil.

03:02.420 --> 03:03.710
Oh, okay,

03:03.710 --> 03:05.080
I'll see if there's
any out there.

03:05.080 --> 03:06.620
Whoa!

03:06.620 --> 03:08.120
We can do that.

03:08.120 --> 03:09.540
In fact, we've done that.

03:09.540 --> 03:10.670
We have?

03:11.920 --> 03:13.210
You remember

03:13.210 --> 03:15.000
that big project
for De Vil Petroleum.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.880
Hmm, De Vil Petroleum?

03:20.880 --> 03:22.670
Nope, nope,
doesn't ring a bell.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.710
It was the biggest
oil-drilling job

03:25.710 --> 03:28.540
the county had ever seen,
and they needed experts like us.

03:28.540 --> 03:31.080
Oh, right, now I remember.

03:34.620 --> 03:37.670
Lucky:
There must be a way
to stop this thing.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.330
Hurry up!

03:41.330 --> 03:43.620
The electrical fashion parade
starts in five minutes.

03:47.250 --> 03:48.250
Whoa!

03:57.620 --> 04:00.750
Jasper, look!
The puppy's gonna
break the pump.

04:00.750 --> 04:02.620
-Stop him.

04:19.040 --> 04:21.250
You busted my bulbs.

04:21.250 --> 04:23.080
He's at it again.

04:24.120 --> 04:25.080
Jasper: Get him!

04:27.420 --> 04:28.620
Get away from there.

04:42.170 --> 04:43.290
Ah!

04:53.210 --> 04:55.500
-Got ya'!

04:57.120 --> 04:58.790
Whoa!

05:01.920 --> 05:03.040
Ah!

05:07.830 --> 05:09.920
Jasper:
Get that dog!

05:17.960 --> 05:19.380
Whoa!

05:19.380 --> 05:22.080
Both: Ahh!

05:23.210 --> 05:24.880
Hey, Jasper.

05:24.880 --> 05:26.420
What's "turbo" mean?

05:28.170 --> 05:29.620
-Trouble!

05:31.250 --> 05:33.920
Everybody out
before she blows!

05:53.250 --> 05:56.880
Ooh, those darn pups!

05:56.880 --> 05:58.960
Pups?
What pups?

05:58.960 --> 06:00.960
No, he said up.

06:00.960 --> 06:02.620
The way we did
that oil-drilling job

06:02.620 --> 06:04.710
moved us right "up"
to Foremen.

06:04.710 --> 06:06.540
Really

06:06.540 --> 06:08.790
Maybe I've been
thinking too small, here.

06:08.790 --> 06:10.620
Bigger job,
bigger commission.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.670
My boss says
that's rule number one.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.880
Here's an opening
for experienced criminologist.

06:16.880 --> 06:19.000
Have you had
any experience
in crime fighting?

06:19.000 --> 06:20.580
-Yep.
-Nope.

06:22.040 --> 06:24.120
Why, we forgot
more crime fighting

06:24.120 --> 06:26.880
than most crime fighters
ever... forgot.

06:26.880 --> 06:28.080
What was the question?

06:28.080 --> 06:29.830
Oh, wait, I know,
crime fighting.

06:29.830 --> 06:31.500
Well, take that time

06:31.500 --> 06:34.460
we stopped the great
Grutely supermarket robbery.

06:34.460 --> 06:36.170
Really

06:36.170 --> 06:37.750
I mean, oh!

06:37.750 --> 06:40.960
Oh, right!
Oh, that time.

06:41.920 --> 06:44.830
Fools! Bumblers!
Incompetents!

06:44.830 --> 06:46.830
Here, put on
these burglar masks,

06:46.830 --> 06:48.580
and go rob
those two old coots!

06:50.080 --> 06:51.120
Rob?

06:51.120 --> 06:52.580
Exactly.

06:52.580 --> 06:55.750
If they think this area
is riddled with crime,

06:55.750 --> 06:59.170
they'll be so scared
they'll beg me to buy them out.

06:59.170 --> 07:00.750
Do it right this time!

07:00.750 --> 07:02.000
I'll be waiting.

07:03.540 --> 07:04.750
Jasper:
Okay now,

07:04.750 --> 07:06.620
don't forget your lines.

07:06.620 --> 07:07.790
I got it.

07:07.790 --> 07:10.960
This is a fork-up,
stick out your money.

07:10.960 --> 07:13.120
No, Horace,
say it right!

07:13.120 --> 07:15.040
-It's ,"This is a stick-up--"

07:15.040 --> 07:17.120
Man:
Yeah, our stick-up.

07:17.120 --> 07:19.460
We've been casing
this place for months.

07:19.460 --> 07:21.040
You watch 'em, Fingers.

07:21.040 --> 07:24.290
I'll get some rope
and tie up these two
butt-in-skis.

07:24.290 --> 07:26.830
And don't forget
my bag of "Anymutt."

07:26.830 --> 07:29.920
Freeze!
Everybody,
this is a hold up!

07:32.790 --> 07:34.210
-Jackpot!

07:34.210 --> 07:36.080
This is even heavier
than I thought it would be.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.500
If you know
what's good for you,

07:38.500 --> 07:39.920
don't move.

07:41.420 --> 07:43.580
Oh, just our luck!

07:43.580 --> 07:45.580
Now how are we
gonna make our getaway?

07:46.880 --> 07:48.920
This way,
you blithering twits!

07:50.960 --> 07:53.290
Hey, wait a--
What are you--

07:55.540 --> 07:57.170
Hey, where's the loot?

07:57.170 --> 07:59.830
This is nothing
but a bunch of dog food.

07:59.830 --> 08:01.830
What are you two
babbling about now?

08:01.830 --> 08:03.750
I demand you turn
this car around,

08:03.750 --> 08:06.080
and take me back
so I can make Mom and Pop

08:06.080 --> 08:08.790
a ridiculously low offer
for their store.

08:08.790 --> 08:10.420
To close the deal,
I even brought

08:10.420 --> 08:11.420
this sack of cash.

08:12.710 --> 08:14.880
Sack of cash?

08:14.880 --> 08:16.420
Cruella:
Wait a minute!

08:16.420 --> 08:17.750
What are you-- whoa!

08:18.960 --> 08:20.710
Do you know who I am?

08:23.670 --> 08:25.830
Horace:
I think I finally
got it right, Jasper.

08:25.830 --> 08:28.790
Listen, this is a stick-up,
fork over the money!

08:28.790 --> 08:30.040
Too late for that, Horace.

08:30.040 --> 08:31.580
Try this one.

08:31.580 --> 08:33.920
Help! We're trapped
in store room!

08:33.920 --> 08:36.750
Help! We're stored
in a trap room!

08:36.750 --> 08:38.000
Close.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.880
Both: Help! Help!

08:42.250 --> 08:44.040
Help.

08:44.040 --> 08:47.880
Uh, I mean, uh,
yes, I remember.

08:47.880 --> 08:50.710
After that, we were remembered
as the dynamic duo.

08:50.710 --> 08:52.790
So if you got
a crime fighting job open,

08:52.790 --> 08:54.420
we're your men.

08:54.420 --> 08:56.080
Yes, we are.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.500
I'm sorry.

08:57.500 --> 09:00.500
I'm afraid I can't
be of service to you gentlemen.

09:00.500 --> 09:01.670
It's all your fault.

09:01.670 --> 09:03.710
You two are over-qualified

09:03.710 --> 09:05.670
for the kind of openings
they let me handle.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.670
Did you say "over

09:07.670 --> 09:10.830
Promoted to Foreman,
foiling a major robbery--

09:10.830 --> 09:12.670
why, you're way too good
for these jobs.

09:12.670 --> 09:14.880
I'm taking you upstairs
to interview

09:14.880 --> 09:15.920
for a management position.

09:17.920 --> 09:20.790
See, I told you
I could look smart.

09:25.790 --> 09:26.880
Well, gentlemen,

09:26.880 --> 09:28.960
after reading his notes
of your interview,

09:28.960 --> 09:31.120
I can see why
my young associate

09:31.120 --> 09:32.710
was so impressed.

09:32.710 --> 09:34.710
Well, not to be bragging,
mind you,

09:34.710 --> 09:36.620
but there aren't
many kinds of jobs

09:36.620 --> 09:38.080
that we ain't worked at.

09:38.080 --> 09:39.830
And been fired from.

09:41.960 --> 09:43.670
Uh, did he say fired?

09:43.670 --> 09:45.750
No, "tired."

09:45.750 --> 09:47.500
He said tired.

09:47.500 --> 09:51.580
We're tired of jobs
that don't match
our big-time talents.

09:51.580 --> 09:54.620
Well, your crime fighting
experience is quite impressive,

09:54.620 --> 09:56.460
but have you ever
been in charge

09:56.460 --> 09:58.460
of an entire
security operation?

09:58.460 --> 09:59.620
Are you kidding?

09:59.620 --> 10:00.790
We ran a security force

10:00.790 --> 10:03.080
guarding millions of dollars
worth of stuff.

10:05.120 --> 10:07.920
This is one-dog-one,
east wing clear, over.

10:07.920 --> 10:11.170
This is, um, uh,
wiener dog seven.

10:11.170 --> 10:13.420
Uh, whatever you said, over.

10:15.250 --> 10:16.460
Look at 'em.

10:17.620 --> 10:19.750
Spot:
They'll never leave
their posts.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.790
Rolly:
They're like robots.

10:22.620 --> 10:24.210
Here's the plan.

10:27.880 --> 10:30.380
Welcome to
The Commercial Channel.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.750
Making toast is as easy
as making toast

10:32.750 --> 10:34.790
with the Toast Toaster
Toaster oven.

10:34.790 --> 10:37.620
Yours for 3 easy installments
of $79.95.

10:38.620 --> 10:40.620
If only I had the money.

10:40.620 --> 10:42.670
Announcer:
Become a professional ballerina

10:42.670 --> 10:45.670
in three easy lessons
for only $99.99.

10:45.670 --> 10:48.580
Both:
If only we had the money.

10:49.710 --> 10:52.210
Hey, west dog,
we could borrow some money

10:52.210 --> 10:53.880
from that purse
in the closet.

10:53.880 --> 10:56.540
And how would
we pay it back,
wiener dog?

10:56.540 --> 10:58.210
Announcer:
Are you low on cash?

10:58.210 --> 11:00.960
Dying to borrow money,
but don't know how
to pay it back?

11:00.960 --> 11:03.500
Play the super-duper
legal state lottery.

11:03.500 --> 11:06.620
The jackpot is up to
29 trillion dollars!

11:12.380 --> 11:15.120
Doggone it!

11:15.120 --> 11:17.250
We'll win the lottery,
replace the money,

11:17.250 --> 11:19.710
and buy all the cool stuff
we saw on the television.

11:19.710 --> 11:21.500
-Quick, everybody--
-Panic!

11:21.500 --> 11:23.830
Don't panic.
Make like fuzzy slippers.

11:28.830 --> 11:30.710
Just find the money, Horace.

11:30.710 --> 11:31.920
We hid it in a shoe box.

11:31.920 --> 11:33.670
Aww, look how cute.

11:33.670 --> 11:36.460
I've just got
to try these on.

11:38.670 --> 11:39.920
The money!

11:41.540 --> 11:44.790
West dog, help!
The slippers are
stealing the money!

11:44.790 --> 11:46.920
It's just the puppies,
you wiener dog!

11:48.830 --> 11:49.830
Get 'em.

12:05.620 --> 12:07.620
Where'd they go?

12:07.620 --> 12:09.330
I feel pretty.

12:10.540 --> 12:11.540
Hm.

12:16.920 --> 12:19.460
Ooh! Why, you--

12:20.580 --> 12:22.040
You know,
with the right belt,

12:22.040 --> 12:23.460
that would look fabulous.

12:26.250 --> 12:29.290
And that's how we solved
that big robbery.

12:29.290 --> 12:30.620
Horace:
Yup, I remember.

12:30.620 --> 12:32.500
Those pups
were a nuisance,

12:32.500 --> 12:34.040
but I liked the dress.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.750
Dress?
What's he muttering about?

12:37.750 --> 12:40.670
Stress, he said stress.

12:40.670 --> 12:43.620
Most crime fighters
couldn't handle the stress
of that job,

12:43.620 --> 12:44.670
but we flew
right through it.

12:44.670 --> 12:46.620
We liked that stress.

12:46.620 --> 12:47.500
See?

12:47.500 --> 12:50.460
So what kind
of management position

12:50.460 --> 12:52.000
are you prepared to offer?

12:52.000 --> 12:53.880
Hmm, with your talents,

12:53.880 --> 12:56.960
I should be thinking about
something more creative
than security.

12:56.960 --> 12:58.920
Have you ever considered

12:58.920 --> 13:01.000
the entertainment industry?

13:01.000 --> 13:03.290
Showbiz? Ho! Darn!

13:03.290 --> 13:04.960
I should have brought
all my awards.

13:04.960 --> 13:06.880
You know we were
top movie executives.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.620
Top movie executives?

13:12.080 --> 13:13.500
Tickets?

13:13.500 --> 13:15.620
-Fine.
-Tickets, please.

13:15.620 --> 13:18.420
-Ooh!

13:18.420 --> 13:20.580
Hold on there, lady.

13:23.040 --> 13:27.620
Sneaking in some
confectionery contraband
today, are we, huh?

13:27.620 --> 13:29.500
Listen,
you'll buy it from us

13:29.500 --> 13:31.620
or it's bye-bye from us.

13:34.460 --> 13:36.330
Huh? Hey.
Ah!

13:39.460 --> 13:41.420
Oh! Whoa--

13:50.170 --> 13:51.540
Off me, you fools.

13:59.540 --> 14:00.750
Pesky pups.

14:00.750 --> 14:02.580
We almost stopped 'em.

14:04.580 --> 14:06.330
Uh, stopped 'em?

14:06.330 --> 14:07.580
Uh, stopped who?

14:07.580 --> 14:09.920
Uh, no, he said dropped.

14:09.920 --> 14:12.210
We dropped out
of the movie business,

14:12.210 --> 14:15.170
and-- and, we'd really
like to move on to a new field.

14:15.170 --> 14:17.500
Gentlemen,
your kind of ambition

14:17.500 --> 14:19.790
warms my heart
and fills my wallet.

14:19.790 --> 14:21.250
Let's see.

14:21.250 --> 14:24.540
I've got a Vice Presidency
open in the railroad business.

14:24.540 --> 14:27.120
Now you're on
the right track.

14:27.120 --> 14:29.170
Why, me and Horace
set new records

14:29.170 --> 14:30.380
in railroad safety.

14:34.330 --> 14:37.080
Both:
♪ I've been working
on the railroad ♪

14:37.080 --> 14:39.170
♪ All the live-long day ♪

14:40.290 --> 14:42.580
♪ I've been working
on the railroad ♪

14:42.580 --> 14:44.120
♪ Just to pass
the time a-- ♪

14:44.120 --> 14:45.290
Hey.

14:47.170 --> 14:49.500
Horace, what are
you doing?

14:49.500 --> 14:51.540
About 50 miles an hour.

14:51.540 --> 14:53.330
Get in here!

14:55.460 --> 14:58.960
Oh! Get me out of here!

15:13.330 --> 15:15.170
-Ready.

15:15.170 --> 15:17.750
Will you go already?!

15:39.290 --> 15:41.620
Oh, papa,
here they come.

16:13.290 --> 16:15.540
Hey, now, that wasn't so bad.

16:15.540 --> 16:17.540
Except for
the broken bones.

16:23.210 --> 16:26.420
I still got bruises
on my bruises.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.290
Ooh! Ooh!

16:28.290 --> 16:30.290
Uh, is he all right?

16:30.290 --> 16:31.830
Oh, yeah, yeah, he's fine.

16:31.830 --> 16:34.080
A-choo-choo,
he's saying.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.420
See, Horace
is just reminding me

16:35.420 --> 16:39.040
that we went on
to win the Choo Choo Chiefs
of the Year award.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.250
Very impressive.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.380
In fact, too impressive!

16:43.380 --> 16:45.040
Too impressive?

16:45.040 --> 16:47.040
I'd better stop
looking so smart.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.290
The truth is, gentlemen,

16:48.290 --> 16:50.210
I can't begin
to do you two justice.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.830
You belong upstairs
with our chairman of the board.

16:52.830 --> 16:55.750
He specializes in placing
outstanding management teams,

16:55.750 --> 16:56.750
like yourselves.

16:59.290 --> 17:02.040
Please, follow me
to the penthouse.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.040
My underling was
very impressed

17:07.040 --> 17:08.830
with your
railroading expertise,

17:08.830 --> 17:11.380
but the only top openings
I have right now

17:11.380 --> 17:13.040
are in air travel.

17:13.040 --> 17:16.000
Well, then this
is your lucky day.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.710
Horace and me,
we got all kinds
of flying experience.

17:18.710 --> 17:21.120
We've flown jets,
props, blimps.

17:21.120 --> 17:23.210
And things nobody
ever flew before.

17:28.040 --> 17:29.290
If I didn't
know any better,

17:29.290 --> 17:31.790
I'd say these puppies
are trying to stop us

17:31.790 --> 17:33.330
from stealing the water.

17:33.330 --> 17:34.670
Oh, don't worry, Horace.

17:34.670 --> 17:36.080
You don't know any better.

17:36.080 --> 17:37.380
In fact, you don't
know anything.

17:37.380 --> 17:39.000
That's a relief.

17:40.540 --> 17:43.000
I told you Swamp Rat
would have helium.

17:43.000 --> 17:46.000
Yeah, it's a good thing
we had Dipstick to trade.

17:46.000 --> 17:49.170
Hmm, I wonder how much
it'll cost to get him back.

17:50.170 --> 17:52.080
-It's finally working.

17:52.080 --> 17:54.420
-We did it!

17:59.750 --> 18:02.120
-Help! Help!

18:10.750 --> 18:11.790
There you are!

18:11.790 --> 18:13.170
What are you doing?

18:13.170 --> 18:14.580
Where is my water?

18:16.380 --> 18:19.080
Well, madame,
there was a slight problem.

18:19.080 --> 18:20.120
I don't know anything.

18:20.120 --> 18:21.790
Ooh!

18:22.920 --> 18:25.250
Not to mention
that time we flew a spaceship.

18:25.250 --> 18:27.500
It was more
like falling, actually,

18:27.500 --> 18:30.330
after those pups
dropped the booster.

18:44.620 --> 18:47.080
Horace, stop that snoring.

18:56.290 --> 18:58.790
Ooh, ooh, those macaroons!

18:58.790 --> 19:02.080
They were supposed to test it,
not test drive it!

19:21.290 --> 19:23.960
Woman:
Some romantic cruise!

19:23.960 --> 19:27.040
Exactly 854 passengers

19:27.040 --> 19:29.250
and all of them women.

19:29.250 --> 19:32.170
When I get home,
I'm gonna sue my travel agent,

19:32.170 --> 19:34.330
unless he's single.

19:35.580 --> 19:37.920
Oh my gosh!
Look at that.

19:37.920 --> 19:39.330
Men!

19:39.330 --> 19:41.250
Stop the boat!

19:41.250 --> 19:43.000
Stop the boat!

19:43.000 --> 19:45.920
There may
be space men inside.

19:45.920 --> 19:49.040
-Oh.

19:52.120 --> 19:55.170
Why, I've never encountered
such versatility--

19:55.170 --> 19:58.330
space experts, aviators,
crime fighters,

19:58.330 --> 20:00.040
movie moguls!

20:00.040 --> 20:02.540
And don't forget
electrical engineers.

20:03.790 --> 20:06.620
♪ Oh, Christmas tree,
oh, Christmas tree ♪

20:06.620 --> 20:10.080
♪ How steel and chrome
you ah-ah-are ♪

20:10.080 --> 20:12.710
♪ Made from lots
of shiny parts ♪

20:12.710 --> 20:16.210
♪ We lifted from
a ca-ah-ar ♪

20:19.250 --> 20:20.250
Yikes!

20:23.500 --> 20:25.170
Merry Christmas.

20:25.170 --> 20:26.670
Buy, shop, spend!

20:26.670 --> 20:30.170
Merry Christmas.
Buy, shop, spend!

20:30.170 --> 20:33.330
Merry Christmas.
Buy, shop, spend!

20:33.330 --> 20:35.710
So what do you say,
Mr. Candice?

20:35.710 --> 20:37.750
We got the skills,
you got the jobs.

20:37.750 --> 20:39.420
So let's shake
and do business.

20:39.420 --> 20:41.830
Are you willing to relocate?

20:41.830 --> 20:44.460
No, but we'll move
any place you want.

20:46.210 --> 20:48.500
Finding just
the right position

20:48.500 --> 20:50.170
for all your many talents

20:50.170 --> 20:51.960
is a real challenge.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.040
I want to call
a special meeting

20:54.040 --> 20:57.420
of the board of directors
and get the whole team
pulling together.

20:57.420 --> 20:59.620
Mr. Jasper!
Mr. Horace!

20:59.620 --> 21:01.580
I found you
the perfect job!

21:01.580 --> 21:06.120
"Wanted: two versatile,
unique, superior persons

21:06.120 --> 21:07.580
"for a challenging assignment.

21:07.580 --> 21:09.960
"Must be multi-talented,
flexible,

21:09.960 --> 21:12.120
and willing
to start immediately."

21:12.120 --> 21:14.920
That's us,
willing to start immediately.

21:14.920 --> 21:17.500
"Great benefits,
flexible hours,

21:17.500 --> 21:19.460
and a fair salary."

21:19.460 --> 21:21.000
Salary?

21:21.000 --> 21:22.420
We'd even get a salary?

21:22.420 --> 21:23.580
We'll take it.

21:23.580 --> 21:25.580
Good work, young man.

21:25.580 --> 21:27.380
There'll be a raise
in your next paycheck.

21:27.380 --> 21:29.710
Now take
the company limousine

21:29.710 --> 21:32.170
and deliver Mr. Horace
and Mr. Jasper

21:32.170 --> 21:34.290
right to their
new employer.

21:37.790 --> 21:39.750
Some buggy!

21:39.750 --> 21:41.210
They must be lost.

21:42.210 --> 21:44.920
I'm here to deliver
your two new executives.

21:44.920 --> 21:46.960
Executives?

21:46.960 --> 21:48.080
Oh my goodness.

21:48.080 --> 21:49.880
We just need
two puppy sitters

21:49.880 --> 21:52.250
to replace me
during my vacation.

21:52.250 --> 21:54.120
Horace and Jasper:
Puppy sitters?!

21:54.120 --> 21:55.830
Both: No!

21:58.210 --> 22:00.040
Think of it this way, Horace.

22:00.040 --> 22:03.000
We can put it on our resume
as food management experts.

22:03.000 --> 22:05.120
Food management experts,

22:05.120 --> 22:06.460
wow.

22:06.460 --> 22:08.210
Jasper:
Faster, Horace! Faster!

22:08.210 --> 22:11.670
I'm food management experting
as fast as I can!
