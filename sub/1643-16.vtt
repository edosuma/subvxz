11:54.380 --> 11:55.548
- He's your brother.
- I know.

And I know he helped you out
with your dad back in the day,

11:57.717 --> 11:59.594
but you should see
the kind of person he is now,

11:59.677 --> 12:01.471
the kind of people he keeps friends with.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.056
You want to know
what the 90 grand was for?

12:03.139 --> 12:04.933

- You.

12:05.808 --> 12:06.809

when you were 18 years old

from your mother's life insurance?

12:10.605 --> 12:12.523
The money that paid for your degree,
that got you this job,

12:12.607 --> 12:14.400
that bought you your loft?

12:14.484 --> 12:17.320
Your mother never had life insurance.
That money came from Lincoln.

12:19.530 --> 12:21.074
- How?
- He borrowed it.

12:21.324 --> 12:23.326
He knew it would be tough to pay back,
but that didn't matter,

12:23.409 --> 12:25.495
because he thought you deserved it.

12:25.578 --> 12:29.123
He also knew you'd never accept it
if you knew it came from him.

12:29.582 --> 12:33.127
Michael, you are where you are
because of your brother.

12:34.879 --> 12:37.715
You're telling me
he is where he is because of me?

12:47.016 --> 12:48.184
Why?

12:50.019 --> 12:51.980
Why didn't you tell me about the money?

12:53.356 --> 12:55.692
- No need to.
- Oh, Linc.

Who told you? Veronica?

12:59.904 --> 13:02.323

- Glad she got out when she did, huh?

13:06.536 --> 13:08.621
You know how she feels about you.

If we'd talked,

13:29.600 --> 13:31.811

32:58.268 --> 33:00.395
- There you go.
- Hey. Thank you.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.108
Let me get your change.

33:24.711 --> 33:25.795
Do you want your change?

33:29.216 --> 33:30.425
Keep it.

33:43.104 --> 33:44.481
DEDEI And this is his.

33:44.648 --> 33:45.857
(SIGHING)

33:47.317 --> 33:50.612
Love it. That's different.

33:53.698 --> 33:54.783
_H€Y-
_H€Y-

33:54.866 --> 33:56.660
- Daddy!
- Hey, sweetheart.

33:56.743 --> 33:59.120
- Come here.
- Hey, there.

33:59.788 --> 34:01.039
C-NOTE: Hey.

34:02.666 --> 34:04.042
You know I got...

34:06.962 --> 34:08.213
I got to tell you something,

34:10.590 --> 34:12.884
and it's gonna be really hard to hear.

34:14.844 --> 34:16.137
Okay.

34:25.480 --> 34:26.565
What?

34:27.399 --> 34:28.942
Well, the thing is,

34:35.447 --> 34:38.368
I'm being shipped back off.

34:39.327 --> 34:41.329
- What?
- Yeah.

34:42.539 --> 34:45.958
My unit just got called back
for another tour, baby.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.043
(SIGHING) I can't believe it.

34:48.420 --> 34:49.920
Deployment orders just came down.

34:50.005 --> 34:51.840
You know, with the Italians
pulling out and everything.

34:51.922 --> 34:53.550
Tell them no, Daddy.

34:56.844 --> 34:59.014
<i>DARNS: Yo, B.
KAY GEE". Come here.</i>

35:01.266 --> 35:03.101
Can you give me a hand
with something out back?

35:03.184 --> 35:04.352
Okay.

35:13.153 --> 35:14.613
(SIGHING)

35:16.114 --> 35:18.033
That's my sister you lied to in there.

35:19.659 --> 35:22.829
Which is why I know you're going to
take care of them when I'm gone.

35:23.913 --> 35:25.206
This is crazy.

35:25.915 --> 35:29.502
Maybe. But so is the way
I got kicked out of the Army.

35:29.878 --> 35:32.714
So is the way
I got busted for driving that truck.

35:33.381 --> 35:36.217
And so is the way
I feel about that woman up in there.

35:37.135 --> 35:38.928
She married a military man

35:40.472 --> 35:42.974
who knows
how to take care of his business.

35:43.933 --> 35:48.396
Now if I look like one of these thugs, now,
what do think she's going to do? Huh?

35:48.480 --> 35:50.398
How long do you think
she's going to wait for me

35:50.482 --> 35:51.441
while I'm inside?

35:52.859 --> 35:54.235
I don't know, man.

35:56.279 --> 35:57.822
You owe me this, man.

35:59.199 --> 36:02.410
Don't you ever let her know where I am.

36:03.078 --> 36:04.371
Do you feel me?

36:42.283 --> 36:44.744
Usually, I do this the other way.

36:45.328 --> 36:47.831
- Why do you want to...
- I want what I want.

36:48.206 --> 36:50.417
(MUSIC PLAYING ON SOUND SYSTEM)

36:50.625 --> 36:52.460
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

36:54.796 --> 36:59.300
You show this to anyone else,
I am calling the whole thing off.

38:08.077 --> 38:09.204
(BUZZER SOUNDING)

38:21.216 --> 38:22.717
My therapist said...

38:24.385 --> 38:26.638
She said that I'm holding too much in

38:27.722 --> 38:29.724
and that I need to confront you

38:30.433 --> 38:32.644
to let you know how betrayed I feel.

38:34.562 --> 38:36.189
I let you into my life,

38:37.232 --> 38:38.316
my home,

38:38.733 --> 38:40.568
my God, I let you near my children!

38:40.652 --> 38:44.322
- I never touched them.
- You should have told me what you were.

38:46.282 --> 38:49.410
You think that you're the only one
who feels betrayed?

38:52.413 --> 38:57.627
I loved you, Susan.

39:00.505 --> 39:01.714
Real love.

39:02.507 --> 39:04.551
For the first time in my life.

39:05.760 --> 39:07.095
(SNIFFLES)

39:11.099 --> 39:13.560
And then to have you do me like that,

39:13.643 --> 39:16.896
to just throw me out to the dogs,
just toss me out the back door...

39:16.980 --> 39:19.148
- You're a murderer, Teddy!
- That's enough!

39:23.111 --> 39:24.821
I have sinned in the past,

39:25.989 --> 39:27.699
but when I met you,

39:28.533 --> 39:31.786
that person, the one that did
all those terrible things, he died.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.454
And I was reborn.

39:35.331 --> 39:37.625
By the grace of your love, I was a...

39:38.626 --> 39:41.004
A new man. A better man.

39:42.505 --> 39:43.798
No.

39:44.257 --> 39:48.845
That doesn't just erase the man
who killed six students in Alabama.

39:53.433 --> 39:55.602
I guess that's where you're right.

39:59.939 --> 40:03.443
Because when you sent me here
to this place, with these people,

40:05.612 --> 40:08.489
it brought that old dirty bastard
right back home.

40:09.490 --> 40:11.451
In fact, there was a candle

40:12.994 --> 40:14.245
in the window

40:16.497 --> 40:19.292
just waiting for me
to walk up them front steps.

40:31.721 --> 40:33.264
You know, I'm gonna...

40:34.766 --> 40:36.768
I'm gonna get out of here someday.

40:38.686 --> 40:39.979
And when I do,

40:45.568 --> 40:50.031
don't think I won't remember
what your front steps look like, Susan.

41:02.585 --> 41:04.253
(BIRDS CHIRPING)

41:20.853 --> 41:22.230
It's almost over.

41:23.731 --> 41:25.191
Burrows will be dead soon

41:25.274 --> 41:28.069
and then things will start
getting back to normal.

41:35.076 --> 41:38.287
I know that you've been through a lot,

41:39.205 --> 41:42.500
but I promise you
the worst is now behind us.

41:57.015 --> 41:58.307
My dear sister,

42:00.935 --> 42:03.312
you have no idea what I've been through.

42:05.440 --> 42:06.983
Good night, Terrence.
