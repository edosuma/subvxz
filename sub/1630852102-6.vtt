ROBERT SOUZA: <i>Getting the Freeway Killer,</i>

01:28.963 --> 01:31.758
<i>William Bonin, off the street</i>
<i>was a big relief to us.</i>

01:33.343 --> 01:35.470
There were four accomplices
that we know about.

01:35.553 --> 01:38.389
<i>So we knew the work was really</i>
<i>just beginning</i>

01:39.140 --> 01:40.475
<i>trying to figure out</i>

01:40.558 --> 01:43.103
<i>how he was able to</i>
<i>manipulate them to do things.</i>

01:43.728 --> 01:45.230
MURPHY: <i>In June of 1980,</i>

01:45.313 --> 01:47.440
detectives, including John St. John,

01:47.524 --> 01:50.360
interrogated William Bonin
about the freeway killings

01:50.443 --> 01:51.736
and his four accomplices.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.863
These interrogations were recorded,

01:53.947 --> 01:57.867
and it is chilling to hear
how calm William Bonin is,

01:58.284 --> 01:59.702
uh, especially as he discusses

01:59.786 --> 02:02.247
how he met his accomplice, Vernon Butts.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.208
INTERVIEWER:
<i>Mr. Bonin, why don't you start</i>

02:05.291 --> 02:09.087
<i>and tell us</i>
<i>how you got started in this.</i>

02:09.879 --> 02:14.717
WILLIAM BONIN: <i>Me and Vernon were at a,</i>
<i>uh... drive-in theater.</i>

02:16.219 --> 02:18.263
<i>I initiated the conversation.</i>

02:18.847 --> 02:20.890
<i>You know, I was joking with him at first.</i>

02:21.724 --> 02:23.601
<i>And Vernon, uh... went along with it.</i>

02:23.935 --> 02:26.813
<i>You know, I was talking about picking up</i>
<i>the hitchhiker in there and having sex.</i>

02:26.896 --> 02:28.731
<i>During all this time I was going out there</i>

02:28.815 --> 02:30.650
<i>I had no intentions of killing the guy.</i>

02:31.401 --> 02:32.944
<i>You know, I looked at Vernon,</i>

02:33.027 --> 02:36.072
<i>I says "Can you go through with</i>
<i>it?" And he says "Yeah."</i>

02:36.698 --> 02:40.076
<i>I strangled him until he was</i>
<i>dead. I believe I used his shirt.</i>

02:44.330 --> 02:46.666
SOUZA: <i>Bonin was very manipulative.</i>

02:47.250 --> 02:50.170
He had kind of a mental control
over his accomplices.

02:50.253 --> 02:51.504
They were young kids.

02:51.671 --> 02:54.549
<i>They probably liked hanging out</i>
<i>with him to get booze and drugs.</i>

02:54.632 --> 02:57.760
<i>Some of these kids were very low IQs.</i>

02:58.386 --> 03:00.722
<i>Although I still think that</i>
<i>it takes a pretty evil mind</i>

03:00.805 --> 03:04.142
even to participate
or be coerced into doing that

03:04.559 --> 03:06.519
if it's not in you to begin with.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.605
It would be pretty hard
to take an honest kid

03:08.688 --> 03:10.273
<i>and get him to do things</i>
<i>that they were doing.</i>

03:13.151 --> 03:15.862
<i>So, as the trial began in the DA's office,</i>

03:15.945 --> 03:18.156
<i>we wound up actually prosecuting him</i>

03:18.239 --> 03:21.284
for ten murder cases in Los Angeles

03:21.659 --> 03:24.829
and then Orange County filed
an additional four after that.

03:24.913 --> 03:26.206
So, there were two separate trials.

03:26.789 --> 03:28.082
MURPHY: <i>William Bonin was convicted</i>

03:28.166 --> 03:29.417
<i>of first degree murder</i>

03:29.500 --> 03:32.003
for killing 14 young men.

03:32.837 --> 03:36.382
<i>Vernon Butts committed suicide</i>
<i>before his trial began.</i>

03:37.217 --> 03:39.385
Greg Miley was convicted
of first degree murder

03:39.469 --> 03:41.054
<i>and received 25 years to life.</i>

03:41.554 --> 03:44.557
<i>William Pugh was convicted</i>
<i>of voluntary manslaughter</i>

03:44.641 --> 03:46.100
<i>and got a six year sentence.</i>

03:46.476 --> 03:49.062
<i>James Munro was convicted</i>
<i>of second degree murder</i>

03:49.145 --> 03:51.648
<i>and received a sentence</i>
<i>of 15 years to life.</i>

03:52.482 --> 03:53.691
SOUZA: <i>Bonin was never charged</i>

03:53.775 --> 03:55.318
<i>with all the murders he committed.</i>

03:55.526 --> 03:57.195
<i>They always go with the strongest cases,</i>

03:57.570 --> 03:59.447
and you can only do so many life sentences

03:59.530 --> 04:00.823
and only be killed once

04:00.907 --> 04:02.784
so the DA's office,

04:02.867 --> 04:05.078
they wanted to be assured
of the prosecution.

04:05.620 --> 04:09.624
<i>I think he was responsible</i>
<i>for probably as many as 25 more.</i>

04:11.042 --> 04:13.503
William Bonin was convicted
and sentenced to death,

04:13.795 --> 04:15.838
but the death penalty was delayed

04:15.922 --> 04:17.006
and delayed and delayed

04:17.090 --> 04:19.008
as his legal team essentially tried

04:19.092 --> 04:21.636
<i>every procedural and legal means</i>

04:21.719 --> 04:22.971
<i>of keeping him alive.</i>

04:23.846 --> 04:25.723
JAMI FLOYD: <i>For the families</i>
<i>that wanted closure,</i>

04:25.807 --> 04:27.392
it was a frustrating time.

04:27.475 --> 04:30.353
Detective Souza and St. John
began to wonder

04:30.436 --> 04:32.772
if William Bonin would outlive them.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.566
SOUZA: <i>I'd been retired for several years,</i>

04:35.650 --> 04:37.986
and I went to St. John's retirement.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.321
It was one of the biggest
retirements I'd ever seen.

04:40.405 --> 04:43.074
And at that retirement,
John and I had our moment.

04:43.157 --> 04:44.909
We sat and had a drink together
and he said,

04:44.993 --> 04:46.494
"I want you to promise me something."

04:46.577 --> 04:48.162
I said, "Yeah, whatever you need, John."

04:48.955 --> 04:53.293
<i>And he said, "I have a problem</i>
<i>I might not be around</i>

04:53.710 --> 04:55.670
<i>"when they execute Bonin in San Quentin.</i>

04:56.796 --> 04:59.424
<i>"Make me a promise that</i>
<i>you will be at that execution</i>

04:59.507 --> 05:00.675
<i>"whenever it happens.</i>

05:01.759 --> 05:03.678
<i>You have to represent us as a team."</i>

05:04.804 --> 05:07.682
<i>John knew that he was dying.</i>
<i>He had cancer.</i>

05:07.765 --> 05:10.059
<i>I knew about it, but very few</i>
<i>people knew about it.</i>

05:11.060 --> 05:12.979
He said, "Now I want you
to do something for me."

05:13.062 --> 05:14.939
He said, "I want you to get up
real close to him

05:15.356 --> 05:18.735
<i>and I want you to say</i>
<i>'Adios, you son of a bitch.'"</i>

05:19.527 --> 05:21.154
<i>I said, "I'll be there, John."</i>

05:24.324 --> 05:25.950
MURPHY: <i>Across town in Hollywood,</i>

05:26.034 --> 05:28.077
<i>detectives are working a series of murders</i>

05:28.161 --> 05:30.663
<i>of prostitutes working</i>
<i>on Sunset Boulevard.</i>

05:31.539 --> 05:33.791
<i>Police had recently found three women</i>

05:33.875 --> 05:35.251
<i>who had been shot in the head</i>

05:35.335 --> 05:37.628
<i>and dumped in various parts of the Valley.</i>

05:38.087 --> 05:39.380
<i>They also found another woman</i>

05:39.464 --> 05:40.965
<i>who had been decapitated.</i>

05:41.049 --> 05:43.926
<i>Her body was found near a</i>
<i>dumpster next to a restaurant,</i>

05:44.010 --> 05:45.386
<i>but the head was still missing.</i>

05:46.387 --> 05:49.098
The one thing that all four
of these women had in common

05:49.182 --> 05:51.392
was they were all seen on the Sunset Strip

05:51.476 --> 05:52.769
<i>the night they were killed.</i>

05:59.233 --> 06:01.944
FRANK GARCIA: Back in the late '70s
and all through the '80s,

06:02.028 --> 06:03.780
this was the devil's playground,
if you will.

06:03.863 --> 06:05.281
Everybody came here.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.658
Once the sun went down
and it was nighttime,

06:07.742 --> 06:10.286
<i>the Sunset Strip took on a whole new life.</i>

06:10.703 --> 06:13.706
<i>It was like one giant block party</i>

06:14.082 --> 06:16.125
<i>that went on for almost two miles.</i>

06:16.834 --> 06:18.586
There's always bands,

06:18.669 --> 06:20.421
there's always live music.

06:20.505 --> 06:21.798
(disco music playing)

06:21.881 --> 06:23.508
<i>Everything was spectacle.</i>

06:24.258 --> 06:27.220
We're talking about late 1970s.
We're talking about the disco era.

06:27.303 --> 06:28.971
(rock music playing)

06:29.055 --> 06:31.516
<i>But you could also go out</i>
<i>and see a band like Blondie play</i>

06:31.599 --> 06:32.725
<i>at the Whiskey A Go Go.</i>

06:34.602 --> 06:37.313
<i>These were places filled with young people</i>

06:37.647 --> 06:40.108
<i>who liked to party who were</i>
<i>from all over the city.</i>

06:42.819 --> 06:46.489
It also drew the darkest of the dark.

06:48.616 --> 06:51.744
GARCIA: <i>Liquor, drugs, and sex.</i>

06:51.828 --> 06:53.496
<i>Any kind of sex you wanted.</i>

06:56.207 --> 06:58.042
<i>After looking at the killings,</i>

06:58.501 --> 06:59.544
connections were made.

07:00.545 --> 07:03.131
<i>The common thread that</i>
<i>ran through all of the victims was that</i>

07:03.214 --> 07:05.049
<i>they were always on the Strip</i>

07:06.134 --> 07:08.136
<i>and we started connecting the dots</i>

07:08.636 --> 07:11.597
<i>and lo and behold we got a serial killer</i>

07:11.681 --> 07:13.182
running on the Sunset Strip.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.231
<i>That's when the big bonanza came in,</i>

07:20.314 --> 07:22.692
<i>it was what was found in the alley.</i>

07:25.987 --> 07:27.864
Okay, that's the spot right over there.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.240
This is it right here.

07:46.174 --> 07:48.426
<i>It was in the early morning hours.</i>

07:48.509 --> 07:51.429
There was a man trying to get
into his parking garage there,

07:51.971 --> 07:54.140
and he noticed that there was
a wooden box here,

07:54.223 --> 07:55.808
kind of like a treasure chest.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.769
So, he got out to examine
the contents of the box.

07:59.604 --> 08:02.273
<i>There was panties,</i>
<i>and there was this t-shirt.</i>

08:02.899 --> 08:05.067
<i>The t-shirt said Daddy's Girl on it.</i>

08:05.985 --> 08:08.070
As he unwrapped it,
to the shock of his life,

08:08.154 --> 08:10.364
he discovered that there was
a human head in there,

08:10.448 --> 08:11.491
<i>a woman's head</i>

08:11.574 --> 08:13.659
<i>which belonged to Exxie Wilson</i>

08:14.327 --> 08:15.745
<i>from the Sizzler parking lot.</i>

08:16.162 --> 08:18.873
<i>He immediately left it alone,</i>
<i>called the police.</i>

08:21.209 --> 08:22.710
<i>The coroner shows up</i>

08:22.793 --> 08:25.963
and he sticks a thermometer
inside the head in the throat,

08:26.047 --> 08:29.050
and I think at the time
it registered 38 degrees.

08:29.884 --> 08:31.469
Which means the head had been frozen.

08:34.889 --> 08:36.599
FLOYD: <i>When police examine Exxie's head,</i>

08:36.682 --> 08:38.434
they determined that
the killer had applied

08:38.518 --> 08:39.894
makeup to her head

08:39.977 --> 08:42.230
after it had been removed from her body.

08:43.564 --> 08:46.692
MURPHY: <i>Then the head</i>
<i>was frozen to preserve it.</i>

08:47.735 --> 08:49.612
Police began to form a picture

08:49.695 --> 08:52.698
of just how perverse this killer was.

08:53.991 --> 08:55.409
LEROY OROZCO: <i>They found that the throat</i>

08:55.493 --> 08:57.787
had seminal fluid in the throat area.

08:57.870 --> 09:00.289
In our mind, it was kept as a trophy,

09:00.373 --> 09:02.041
and he had had something to do with it

09:02.124 --> 09:03.459
because of the seminal fluid.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.044
MURPHY: <i>Police were able to determine</i>

09:05.127 --> 09:08.047
<i>that Exxie Wilson had been shot</i>
<i>in the back of the head</i>

09:08.130 --> 09:09.799
with the same caliber bullet

09:09.882 --> 09:12.093
that had been used
to kill the other women.

09:12.176 --> 09:15.388
<i>Cynthia Chandler, Gina Marano,</i>
<i>and Karen Jones.</i>

09:16.556 --> 09:18.683
We had four dead bodies

09:18.766 --> 09:21.143
<i>with the same slugs from the same gun.</i>

09:22.520 --> 09:27.358
And at that point, we didn't
have a clue who could be doing this.

09:28.192 --> 09:29.402
LOUISE FARR: <i>The news came out</i>

09:29.527 --> 09:31.112
<i>that all the women who had been killed</i>

09:31.195 --> 09:33.531
<i>had been frequenting the Sunset Strip.</i>

09:33.864 --> 09:36.325
The killer came to be known as

09:36.409 --> 09:37.743
<i>the Sunset Strip Killer.</i>

09:40.496 --> 09:43.249
Police at the time
had few clues to work with,

09:43.332 --> 09:46.252
<i>so they decided to go</i>
<i>to the media for help.</i>

09:48.421 --> 09:51.841
DETECTIVE: <i>We are requesting</i>
<i>if anyone has any knowledge</i>

09:52.633 --> 09:57.013
<i>about this box or has ever seen</i>
<i>a box like this,</i>

09:57.722 --> 10:01.225
<i>that they contact the</i>
<i>Los Angeles Police Department.</i>

10:06.188 --> 10:10.484
FARR: <i>It was June 30th</i>
<i>when hunters in a ravine near Sylmar</i>

10:10.568 --> 10:13.738
came across the mummified body
of a young woman.

10:13.821 --> 10:16.490
<i>She was later identified as Marnett Comer.</i>

10:16.574 --> 10:17.992
<i>She was only 17.</i>

10:18.367 --> 10:22.079
Marnett Comer was
a runaway from Sacramento

10:22.163 --> 10:25.291
and was working as a prostitute
like some of the other victims.

10:25.791 --> 10:28.294
<i>Police heard reports</i>
<i>that Comer was last seen</i>

10:28.377 --> 10:31.130
<i>wearing a pink t-shirt</i>
<i>that said "Daddy's Girl."</i>

10:32.632 --> 10:34.675
The t-shirt that said "Daddy's Girl"

10:34.759 --> 10:37.720
<i>had been found wrapped</i>
<i>around Exxie Wilson's head.</i>

10:40.389 --> 10:42.808
FLOYD: <i>So, now there's evidence</i>
<i>from one crime scene</i>

10:42.892 --> 10:44.935
showing up at another crime scene.

10:45.436 --> 10:49.106
<i>There wasn't much doubt now</i>
<i>that all of these murders were linked.</i>

10:51.484 --> 10:54.236
It became clear that the Sunset Killer

10:54.320 --> 10:56.822
was keeping souvenirs from his victims.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.327
GARCIA: <i>When they did</i>
<i>the autopsy on her skull,</i>

11:01.410 --> 11:04.789
she too had been shot
in the back portion of her head

11:05.414 --> 11:07.500
with a small caliber gun
which turned out to be

11:07.583 --> 11:09.126
a .25 caliber Raven,

11:09.210 --> 11:12.046
<i>the same gun that had killed</i>
<i>the other four girls.</i>

11:12.129 --> 11:14.715
FLOYD: <i>The fact that</i>
<i>all five victims were killed</i>

11:14.799 --> 11:17.134
<i>with the same gun</i>
<i>was helpful to the police,</i>

11:17.218 --> 11:19.970
<i>but it didn't actually</i>
<i>bring them any closer</i>

11:20.054 --> 11:21.764
<i>to solving the case.</i>

11:21.847 --> 11:25.059
They still had no idea where the
victims had been murdered

11:25.142 --> 11:29.814
or what to do to keep
the killer from killing again.

11:29.897 --> 11:31.816
Police were also left wondering

11:31.899 --> 11:33.651
why most of the victims were shot

11:33.734 --> 11:35.653
in the left side
of the back of their heads.

11:36.487 --> 11:38.072
<i>What was the significance of this?</i>

11:38.155 --> 11:40.991
<i>Could this help explain</i>
<i>who the killer was?</i>

11:46.330 --> 11:48.499
GARCIA: <i>The whole month of July went by</i>

11:48.582 --> 11:51.210
<i>with really no new activity,</i>

11:51.293 --> 11:53.170
no new bodies turning up

11:53.838 --> 11:55.881
<i>until August the 9th.</i>

11:55.965 --> 11:58.175
FLOYD: <i>Some residents</i>
<i>in the San Fernando Valley</i>

11:58.259 --> 12:00.970
<i>called to complain about</i>
<i>a van left on their street</i>

12:01.053 --> 12:03.472
and a really terrible odor.

12:03.889 --> 12:05.516
It was a terrible sight.

12:08.477 --> 12:10.020
<i>They unlocked the van,</i>

12:10.604 --> 12:13.858
<i>and you couldn't see</i>
<i>through the glass of the van</i>

12:13.941 --> 12:16.318
<i>because the flies were so thick.</i>

12:17.570 --> 12:21.240
And in the back of the van was
a male body with no head on it.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.747
<i>There were stab wounds</i>

12:27.830 --> 12:29.999
<i>to the buttocks, to the back,</i>

12:30.458 --> 12:31.917
<i>uh, to the anal area.</i>

12:32.251 --> 12:34.003
<i>There was no gunshot wounds</i>

12:34.962 --> 12:36.630
<i>anywhere on the body.</i>

12:37.465 --> 12:40.342
During the investigation at the van,

12:40.426 --> 12:42.636
<i>officers found a shell casing.</i>

12:43.429 --> 12:46.849
<i>That shell casing came back</i>
<i>to a .25 caliber pistol.</i>

12:49.101 --> 12:50.478
The murder of this individual,

12:50.561 --> 12:52.646
of course, sparked a lot
of interest from the media.

12:53.689 --> 12:55.900
<i>Now you got two bodies in the Valley,</i>

12:55.983 --> 12:57.401
<i>both decapitated</i>

12:57.485 --> 12:59.028
<i>and people were making the assumption</i>

12:59.111 --> 13:00.154
<i>or trying to come up with,</i>

13:00.237 --> 13:01.947
<i>well, maybe they're related.</i>

13:02.782 --> 13:04.408
MURPHY: <i>Even if this case was connected,</i>

13:04.492 --> 13:06.035
why would he kill a man?

13:06.118 --> 13:08.245
All of the victims up to this
point have been women.

13:08.662 --> 13:10.915
This person was identified as Jack Murray

13:12.208 --> 13:14.043
<i>who was a singer</i>

13:14.710 --> 13:16.587
<i>at the Little Nashville bar</i>

13:16.670 --> 13:18.589
<i>that was not too far from there.</i>

13:18.964 --> 13:21.967
<i>He was Australian and kind of a player.</i>

13:23.302 --> 13:25.763
Two days after
Jack Murray's body was found,

13:25.846 --> 13:28.557
LAPD received a call
from Valley Medical Center.

13:29.975 --> 13:32.937
<i>One of the nurses there,</i>
<i>a woman named Carol Bundy,</i>

13:33.020 --> 13:34.855
<i>was acting very strange.</i>

13:35.523 --> 13:38.400
Carol was making statements
to her coworkers

13:38.484 --> 13:41.821
that she and her boyfriend
had been involved in the murders

13:41.904 --> 13:44.281
<i>of prostitutes on Sunset Boulevard.</i>

13:44.990 --> 13:48.994
She was f-feeling so guilt-ridden

13:49.078 --> 13:50.538
she was supposed to be saving lives,

13:50.621 --> 13:51.997
instead she was taking them.

13:52.081 --> 13:54.416
And she was going home now

13:54.500 --> 13:55.793
and she was going to call the police.

13:55.876 --> 13:57.461
(phone rings)

13:57.545 --> 13:59.171
OFFICER KILGORE:
<i>This is Kilgore, can I help you?</i>

13:59.255 --> 14:00.923
-CAROL BUNDY: <i>Mr. Kilgore?</i>
-OFFICER KILGORE: <i>Yeah.</i>

14:01.006 --> 14:03.133
CAROL BUNDY: <i>Sometime back</i>
<i>you were having a series of murders</i>

14:03.217 --> 14:04.385
<i>involving prostitutes in Hollywood.</i>

14:04.468 --> 14:05.594
OFFICER KILGORE: <i>Uh-huh.</i>

14:05.678 --> 14:07.721
CAROL BUNDY:
<i>This man I've been living with,</i>

14:07.805 --> 14:09.974
<i>he's already hit over fifty people.</i>

14:10.057 --> 14:13.310
<i>The point is, he wants to continue</i>
<i>and continue and continue and continue.</i>

14:13.853 --> 14:16.146
<i>Would you like to have your man today?</i>

14:19.149 --> 14:20.985
BAILIFF: <i>Part 123 of the Superior Court</i>

14:21.068 --> 14:22.444
<i>of the State of California</i>

14:22.528 --> 14:24.488
<i>for the county of Los Angeles</i>
<i>is now in session.</i>

14:24.947 --> 14:28.075
FLOYD: <i>During the trial of the</i>
<i>suspected Hillside Strangler,</i>

14:28.158 --> 14:29.535
<i>Angelo Buono,</i>

14:29.618 --> 14:32.079
the prosecution's case rested
on Kenneth Bianchi,

14:32.162 --> 14:33.831
<i>the other Hillside Strangler,</i>

14:33.914 --> 14:35.958
<i>who'd agreed to testify against Buono</i>

14:36.375 --> 14:38.627
<i>but then became an unreliable witness.</i>

14:39.336 --> 14:42.089
<i>Finally, by November of 1983,</i>

14:42.172 --> 14:45.175
<i>the jury was ready to render its verdict.</i>

14:46.510 --> 14:48.721
ROBERT GROGAN:
<i>I was there when the verdict came in.</i>

14:49.263 --> 14:50.472
Uh--

14:52.558 --> 14:53.475
(chuckles)

14:57.813 --> 15:01.984
Ron George came to the bench and he said,

15:02.818 --> 15:04.528
"I'd like to poll the jury,"

15:05.029 --> 15:06.238
and the jury came out,

15:06.322 --> 15:09.742
and he had them polled case by case.

15:10.451 --> 15:13.078
<i>First I should make clear</i>
<i>that whatever transpired,</i>

15:13.162 --> 15:15.831
<i>there was clearly</i>
<i>no withholding of information</i>

15:15.915 --> 15:18.500
<i>by any of the 12 jurors.</i>

15:19.168 --> 15:21.879
GROGAN: <i>How do you find</i>
<i>on the following cases?</i>

15:22.713 --> 15:25.466
And the foreman said,
"On Yolanda Washington,

15:25.549 --> 15:27.176
we find not guilty."

15:31.513 --> 15:33.474
<i>She was the only girl that never went back</i>

15:33.557 --> 15:35.017
<i>to Buono's house.</i>

15:37.770 --> 15:40.981
<i>She was killed by Bianchi</i>
<i>in the back of his car.</i>

15:41.649 --> 15:44.276
And the jury was very clear on that.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.029
Yolanda Washington was
the first Hillside victim,

15:47.112 --> 15:48.489
but her death was different

15:48.572 --> 15:50.366
because Bianchi and Buono

15:50.449 --> 15:52.785
had not really established their MO yet.

15:52.868 --> 15:54.578
<i>There were no evidentiary links</i>

15:54.662 --> 15:56.664
<i>between Buono and Yolanda Washington</i>

15:56.747 --> 15:58.874
<i>that could definitely establish</i>

15:58.958 --> 16:00.584
<i>that he was involved in her death.</i>

16:00.960 --> 16:04.129
ROGER BOREN: <i>I believe that both Buono and</i>
<i>Bianchi killed her.</i>

16:04.755 --> 16:06.465
But, you know, I think
the evidence was such

16:06.799 --> 16:08.300
that that was reasonable for the jury

16:08.384 --> 16:10.594
to find reasonable doubt on that one.

16:12.346 --> 16:14.765
GROGAN: <i>On every other charge,</i>

16:14.848 --> 16:16.976
<i>all nine of the girls,</i>

16:17.059 --> 16:19.144
♪♪

16:19.228 --> 16:21.355
♪♪

16:23.273 --> 16:24.608
Buono was found guilty.

16:25.192 --> 16:27.277
<i>Neither Mr. Buono nor Mr. Bianchi</i>

16:27.361 --> 16:29.905
<i>should ever see</i>
<i>the outside of prison walls</i>

16:29.989 --> 16:31.365
<i>once delivered there.</i>

16:34.159 --> 16:35.953
<i>I would not have the slightest reluctance</i>

16:36.036 --> 16:38.455
<i>to impose the death penalty in this case</i>

16:38.539 --> 16:41.000
<i>were it within my power to do so.</i>

16:41.291 --> 16:42.918
<i>If ever there was a case</i>

16:43.002 --> 16:44.628
<i>where the death penalty is appropriate,</i>

16:44.712 --> 16:46.171
<i>this is that case.</i>

16:47.506 --> 16:49.133
GROGAN: <i>The smart-ass smile</i>

16:49.216 --> 16:51.010
<i>was not on his face anymore.</i>

16:51.677 --> 16:53.137
I was looking at him,

16:53.637 --> 16:55.514
<i>and he knew he had been had.</i>

16:58.058 --> 16:59.351
Justice was served.

17:10.362 --> 17:11.613
<i>We won them all</i>

17:12.156 --> 17:13.991
except Yolanda.

17:15.159 --> 17:16.160
(sighs)

17:18.370 --> 17:20.122
<i>That doesn't change anything.</i>

17:20.956 --> 17:23.500
<i>She was a victim</i>
<i>of the Hillside Stranglers.</i>

17:24.168 --> 17:25.794
No question in my mind.

17:29.715 --> 17:32.509
<i>Fortunately, Buono died</i>
<i>very quickly in prison.</i>

17:35.846 --> 17:39.016
<i>The fact that Bianchi</i>
<i>is still alive in Walla Walla</i>

17:40.017 --> 17:42.770
just pisses me off
more than I can tell you.

17:45.481 --> 17:49.777
(phone dialing)

17:50.778 --> 17:54.865
(phone ringing)

17:55.282 --> 17:56.950
OFFICER KILGORE:
<i>This is Kilgore, can I help you?</i>

17:57.034 --> 17:58.744
-CAROL BUNDY: <i>Mr. Kilgore?</i>
-OFFICER KILGORE: <i>Yeah.</i>

17:58.827 --> 18:00.037
CAROL BUNDY: <i>Hello.</i>

18:00.120 --> 18:02.456
GARCIA: <i>A woman by the name of Carol Bundy</i>

18:02.539 --> 18:05.250
<i>made a phone call to Northeast Division</i>

18:05.334 --> 18:07.377
and spoke to a uniformed officer

18:07.461 --> 18:08.879
by the name of Kilgore.

18:09.588 --> 18:12.216
CAROL BUNDY: <i>Sometime back</i>
<i>you were having a series of murders</i>

18:12.299 --> 18:14.968
<i>-involving prostitutes in Hollywood.</i>
-OFFICER KILGORE: <i>Uh-huh.</i>

18:15.052 --> 18:16.887
<i>CAROL BUNDY:</i>
<i>Would you like to have your man today?</i>

18:17.179 --> 18:21.308
She asked Kilgore
if they wanted their man today,

18:21.391 --> 18:22.893
that she could provide the suspect

18:22.976 --> 18:25.437
in the Sunset killings to him today.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.397
And he was a little taken aback

18:27.481 --> 18:29.316
and didn't really know what she meant.

18:29.399 --> 18:32.486
And she started offering him, uh, clues

18:32.569 --> 18:33.695
about the killings.

18:34.488 --> 18:36.073
CAROL BUNDY: <i>The girl in Balboa...</i>

18:36.156 --> 18:37.116
OFFICER KILGORE: <i>Uh-huh.</i>

18:37.199 --> 18:39.076
CAROL BUNDY:
<i>...was shot in the right elbow.</i>

18:39.159 --> 18:41.578
<i>In any event she was cut down</i>
<i>the middle of her belly.</i>

18:41.662 --> 18:44.915
<i>The, uh... next one up the</i>
<i>line, I don't know if you've got her.</i>

18:44.998 --> 18:48.085
OFFICER KILGORE: <i>How come all of a sudden</i>
<i>you want to roll over on him?</i>

18:48.168 --> 18:49.378
He had wanted to know

18:49.461 --> 18:52.422
why she was rolling over
on her boyfriend at this point.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.175
CAROL BUNDY:
<i>This man I've been living with,</i>

18:55.259 --> 18:57.594
<i>he's already hit over fifty people.</i>

18:57.678 --> 19:01.640
<i>I've only been involved with</i>
<i>perhaps eight or nine of them.</i>

19:01.723 --> 19:04.852
<i>The point is, he wants to continue</i>
<i>and continue and continue and continue.</i>

19:04.935 --> 19:05.936
OFFICER KILGORE: <i>Yeah.</i>

19:06.019 --> 19:08.480
CAROL BUNDY:
<i>And I can't handle it. I'm falling apart</i>

19:08.564 --> 19:11.066
Carol told the cop
at the other end of the line

19:11.150 --> 19:12.818
that she was falling apart

19:12.901 --> 19:15.195
and she just couldn't take
the situation anymore.

19:15.737 --> 19:18.949
<i>And then she changed her attitude slightly</i>
<i>and she said.</i>

19:19.324 --> 19:21.285
CAROL BUNDY: <i>Would you really like to know</i>
<i>the honest truth?</i>

19:21.368 --> 19:23.537
-OFFICER KILGORE: <i>Well, sure.</i>
-CAROL BUNDY: <i>The honest truth is...</i>

19:23.662 --> 19:25.747
-OFFICER KILGORE: <i>I'll be honest with you.</i>
-CAROL BUNDY: <i>Okay,</i>

19:25.831 --> 19:27.374
<i>the honest truth is,</i>
<i>it's fun to kill people.</i>

19:27.457 --> 19:29.543
<i>And if I were allowed to run</i>
<i>loose I'd probably do it again.</i>

19:30.335 --> 19:32.671
OFFICER KILGORE:
<i>Okay. Okay, what's your name?</i>

19:32.754 --> 19:34.173
CAROL BUNDY:
<i>I'm not gonna give you my name</i>

19:34.256 --> 19:35.591
<i>but I'll tell you where you can find me.</i>

19:35.674 --> 19:37.426
-OFFICER KILGORE: <i>Find you?</i>
-CAROL BUNDY: <i>Mm hmm.</i>

19:43.265 --> 19:46.393
Carol Bundy was
ultimately taken into custody

19:46.768 --> 19:49.188
<i>and transported to Van Nuys Homicide.</i>

19:50.898 --> 19:52.649
It was obvious just listening to her

19:52.733 --> 19:56.403
that she was a happy person.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.614
<i>Like, jovial.</i>

19:59.281 --> 20:00.616
<i>It was so strange.</i>

20:00.866 --> 20:03.368
<i>You wouldn't think</i>
<i>this woman's committed murder.</i>

20:03.994 --> 20:05.412
GARCIA: <i>At the very same time,</i>

20:05.495 --> 20:07.873
Carol Bundy's boyfriend, Doug Clark,

20:07.956 --> 20:10.125
<i>was being taken into custody</i>
<i>where he worked</i>

20:10.209 --> 20:12.669
<i>at the Jergens manufacturing</i>
<i>plant in Burbank.</i>

20:12.753 --> 20:14.379
(camera shutters clicking)

20:15.088 --> 20:16.548
OROZCO: <i>We transported Doug</i>

20:17.216 --> 20:19.927
<i>to downtown our office</i>
<i>at Robbery Homicide.</i>

20:20.969 --> 20:23.805
In any case, when you do
a background on somebody,

20:23.889 --> 20:26.183
you usually get a lot of information
on their friends.

20:27.267 --> 20:30.854
<i>In Doug's case,</i>
<i>he had no male friends. Not a one.</i>

20:30.938 --> 20:32.564
<i>By his conversation, you could see</i>

20:32.648 --> 20:34.233
<i>no wonder nobody likes him.</i>

20:34.316 --> 20:35.817
<i>Arrogant, arrogant as hell.</i>

20:35.901 --> 20:37.402
About how good he is, this and that.

20:37.486 --> 20:40.113
He's traveled the world.
Complete opposite of Carol.

20:43.325 --> 20:45.994
It was determined that my partner,

20:46.578 --> 20:49.248
Gary Broder, and myself
would interview Carol.

20:53.001 --> 20:54.878
<i>It's hard to describe Carol.</i>

20:56.755 --> 20:58.674
<i>It's kind of a sad case.</i>

20:59.967 --> 21:03.345
<i>Wears thick glasses, short cropped hair,</i>

21:03.428 --> 21:05.097
<i>not very well-groomed.</i>

21:06.682 --> 21:08.976
<i>I got the impression right away from her</i>

21:09.059 --> 21:12.354
<i>that she was kind of</i>
<i>a lonely desperate woman</i>

21:12.437 --> 21:14.606
<i>that wanted love and affection.</i>

21:16.066 --> 21:18.110
<i>We started to get into the--</i>

21:18.193 --> 21:20.696
how long have you known
Doug Clark, that type of thing.

21:20.904 --> 21:22.990
<i>And as soon as she saw my partner,</i>

21:23.073 --> 21:24.992
<i>a tall dapper-looking guy,</i>

21:25.158 --> 21:27.661
<i>she says, "Excuse me, Sergeant Broder."</i>

21:27.911 --> 21:30.205
And I think he said,
"You can call me Gary."

21:30.747 --> 21:33.500
And she says,
"You're giving me clitoral spasms."

21:34.751 --> 21:37.004
<i>Anyway, she starts talking to us.</i>

21:37.504 --> 21:40.382
<i>The first case we talked</i>
<i>to her about was the sisters.</i>

21:41.049 --> 21:43.552

21:48.640 --> 21:51.393
<i>the brunette Gina Marano, not to look.</i>

21:51.643 --> 21:53.645

21:54.646 --> 21:56.523
CAROL BUNDY: <i>He blew the back of the head.</i>

21:56.606 --> 21:59.568
<i>Into the back of the head</i>

21:59.651 --> 22:02.321
<i>while the older sister was down on him.</i>

22:03.947 --> 22:06.575

22:06.658 --> 22:10.746
are getting shot in the head
above or behind the left ear.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.247
She goes, oh, that's easy.

22:12.331 --> 22:15.292
While the girls are down there
giving him oral sex,

22:16.168 --> 22:18.295
he holds her head down

22:18.879 --> 22:20.630
and that's when he shoots them,
they're helpless.

22:20.714 --> 22:23.133
They can't move, they can't fight,
they can't do anything.

22:23.216 --> 22:25.594
CAROL BUNDY: <i>She didn't have a chance</i>
<i>to be aware of what was going on.</i>

22:25.677 --> 22:26.928
<i>It was bang bang.</i>

22:28.096 --> 22:29.431
GARCIA: <i>After he killed the girls,</i>

22:30.015 --> 22:33.018
<i>he took them to a garage</i>
<i>in Burbank that he had rented.</i>

22:33.518 --> 22:36.396
<i>Clark told Carol</i>
<i>he took the girls in there</i>

22:36.480 --> 22:39.358
<i>and dragged them to the corner</i>
<i>of the-- of the garage</i>

22:39.441 --> 22:40.901
<i>where he had a bed.</i>

22:40.984 --> 22:44.404
He put the bodies of the girls
in different sexual positions,

22:44.488 --> 22:46.907
uh, and he had sex with them.

22:46.990 --> 22:50.285
<i>She said that he had fantasized</i>
<i>and talked to her</i>

22:50.994 --> 22:52.412
<i>about necrophilia,</i>

22:52.496 --> 22:54.873
<i>that he was kind of fascinated by it.</i>

22:55.540 --> 22:57.000
After he finished doing that,

22:57.417 --> 22:59.586
he got the girls back in the car

23:00.045 --> 23:03.507
and took them to the onramp
to the Ventura Freeway,

23:03.965 --> 23:05.842
<i>and that's where he dumped the bodies.</i>

OROZCO: <i>The interview was</i>
<i>one of the strangest ones</i>

23:12.516 --> 23:14.434

<i>And that tone, that's how Carol is.</i>

23:27.948 --> 23:31.451
<i>After that, she went into Exxie Wilson</i>

23:31.535 --> 23:33.412
<i>and what happened to her head.</i>

23:34.663 --> 23:35.997
<i>Carol told us</i>

23:36.289 --> 23:38.417
<i>Doug Clark came home late at night</i>

23:38.792 --> 23:40.919
<i>and in a plastic bag</i>

23:41.795 --> 23:43.088
he had the head of a woman.

23:45.006 --> 23:46.383
<i>Took the head upstairs,</i>

23:46.800 --> 23:48.385
<i>put it on the counter next to the sink,</i>

23:48.468 --> 23:49.845

<i>She said she washes the head,</i>

23:52.889 --> 23:55.434
<i>washes all the blood off it,</i>
<i>shampoos the hair,</i>

23:55.892 --> 23:57.227
<i>and puts makeup on it.</i>

23:58.103 --> 23:59.604

DETECTIVE FRANK GARCIA:
<i>So you actually put make-up on her?</i>

<i>leading to the left rear corner</i>

<i>Of course, it was all under the blood.</i>

27:37.530 --> 27:40.450

27:40.533 --> 27:43.703
If this boot print, barely

27:43.787 --> 27:46.039
could be safely collected as evidence,

27:46.247 --> 27:50.168
detectives might be able to tie
the crime scene to Doug Clark.

27:50.251 --> 27:52.712
The on-scene criminalist
told Detective Garcia

27:52.796 --> 27:54.923
that attempting to collect this boot print

27:55.006 --> 27:56.675
does came with huge risk.

27:56.758 --> 27:59.177
She told us if I lift the print,

27:59.260 --> 28:01.471
it will destroy the blood value in it.

28:01.888 --> 28:03.848
I said that's okay,
we've got plenty of blood.

28:04.641 --> 28:06.142
She lifts the print.

28:07.102 --> 28:09.062
<i>And it's a nice beautiful boot print.</i>

28:12.899 --> 28:16.361

GARCIA: <i>So, the next day, Doug Clark,</i>

28:22.617 --> 28:24.911

very arrogant.

28:39.050 --> 28:40.301
And he's just looking at everybody.

28:40.385 --> 28:41.761
And you could tell he thought, man,

28:42.053 --> 28:44.013
<i>what a bunch of stupid guys</i>
<i>these are, you know.</i>

28:44.389 --> 28:47.726
<i>And then Doug Clark picked up his feet,</i>

28:47.809 --> 28:50.270
<i>put them on the desk,</i>
<i>and crossed his legs.</i>

28:53.273 --> 28:54.774

28:59.237 --> 29:02.657
<i>that very same footprint</i>
<i>on the floor of the garage.</i>

29:03.032 --> 29:06.828
<i>So, we literally ran up to the desk</i>
<i>and take your boots off.</i>

29:06.911 --> 29:08.747
<i>And they were booked into evidence.</i>

29:10.957 --> 29:12.625
MURPHY: <i>The boots were a major</i>
<i>breakthrough,</i>

29:12.709 --> 29:14.252
<i>certainly enough to make an arrest,</i>

29:14.335 --> 29:16.421

29:22.385 --> 29:24.679
<i>that Doug Clark</i>
<i>would have kept those guns,</i>

29:24.763 --> 29:27.682
the instrumentality of murder as trophies,

29:27.766 --> 29:30.018

32:37.622 --> 32:39.832
<i>Finally, a federal appeals court</i>

32:39.916 --> 32:41.834
<i>overturned the conviction.</i>

32:44.170 --> 32:47.382
We were battling in court
in, uh, pretrial motions,

32:47.465 --> 32:50.093
<i>and then Bobby Joe Maxwell</i>
<i>fell into a coma.</i>

32:50.176 --> 32:52.553
<i>Due to his medical condition,</i>

32:53.262 --> 32:54.806
we dropped the charges against him

32:54.889 --> 32:56.474
<i>just before he died.</i>

32:58.309 --> 33:01.229
<i>It doesn't mean that</i>
<i>Bobby Joe Maxwell was guilty,</i>

33:01.312 --> 33:03.022
it doesn't mean that he was not guilty.

33:03.106 --> 33:06.401
It just means that given
the circumstances at the time

33:06.859 --> 33:08.486
we chose not to go forward.

33:13.282 --> 33:15.827
TOM LANGE: <i>Just because they receive</i>
<i>some kind of release</i>

33:15.910 --> 33:17.495
doesn't mean they didn't kill.

33:18.246 --> 33:19.747
It doesn't mean they didn't do it.

33:20.248 --> 33:22.125
Cops can only do what cops do.

33:22.667 --> 33:25.962
<i>They can't do what prosecutors do,</i>
<i>defense attorneys do,</i>

33:26.045 --> 33:29.841
<i>the judge does, the jury does,</i>
<i>what the media says.</i>

33:29.924 --> 33:31.217
<i>You can't do any of that.</i>

33:31.592 --> 33:32.969
You can only do what the cop does.

33:33.594 --> 33:35.430
And the cops did their job.

33:35.513 --> 33:37.932
I went to trial on the evidence
on this thing

33:38.016 --> 33:39.684
up to almost three,
three and a half years ago.

33:41.060 --> 33:43.146
<i>I was still going on this thing</i>
<i>40 years later.</i>

33:45.106 --> 33:46.941
<i>If he'd have lived,</i>
<i>he could have been retried.</i>

33:47.442 --> 33:49.652
<i>But he died, and that was the end of it.</i>

33:53.656 --> 33:55.992
MURPHY: <i>Rodney Alcala</i>
<i>who was The Dating Game Killer</i>

33:56.075 --> 33:59.037
was convicted of Robin Samsoe's
murder in 1980,

33:59.579 --> 34:02.373
but this case was far from over.

34:03.624 --> 34:06.002
<i>This man was incredibly prolific.</i>

34:06.377 --> 34:08.796
But remember, he's arrested in 1979,

34:08.880 --> 34:11.049
and all they knew about him for sure was

34:11.132 --> 34:13.968
<i>the rape and kidnapping of Tali Shapiro.</i>

34:15.219 --> 34:17.513
So, at the time he's arrested
for Robin Samsoe,

34:18.306 --> 34:21.434
<i>the only known murder that</i>
<i>he committed was Robin Samsoe.</i>

34:22.685 --> 34:25.521
<i>It wasn't until 2005 or 2006</i>

34:25.605 --> 34:27.231
<i>when we started getting his DNA hits</i>

34:27.315 --> 34:28.649
<i>where people started to realize</i>

34:28.733 --> 34:32.612
what a massively prolific
serial killer Rodney Alcala was.

34:35.740 --> 34:39.452
<i>Forensic science really</i>
<i>caught up to Rodney Alcala.</i>

34:40.745 --> 34:42.663
GINA SATRIANO:
<i>Using this brand-new technology</i>

34:42.747 --> 34:44.373
<i>that did not exist in the '70s,</i>

34:44.457 --> 34:47.085
the evidence from many different
cold cases

34:47.168 --> 34:49.337
<i>was analyzed for DNA.</i>

34:50.880 --> 34:53.466
<i>One by one, a connection is made</i>

34:53.549 --> 34:56.302
<i>from Rodney Alcala to Charlotte Lamb.</i>

34:57.095 --> 34:58.387
<i>Then Jill Barcomb.</i>

35:00.056 --> 35:02.391
How many people did Rodney Alcala kill?

35:02.475 --> 35:05.186
<i>What we know is at the time</i>
<i>he went on </i>The Dating Game,

35:05.269 --> 35:06.562
he killed at least eight.

35:06.646 --> 35:08.689
<i>But the actual real number is far higher.</i>

35:10.358 --> 35:11.984
There is information that he
had gone to Europe

35:12.068 --> 35:12.985
after he had been paroled.

35:13.069 --> 35:16.197
<i>He was permitted to drive</i>
<i>across the country multiple times.</i>

35:16.280 --> 35:19.325
As a prosecutor, you realize
that you're looking at a guy

35:19.408 --> 35:21.828
<i>who has not just killed</i>
<i>the people you know about,</i>

35:21.911 --> 35:24.789
<i>he's killed dozens upon dozens of people</i>

35:24.872 --> 35:26.332
<i>over the course of his life.</i>

35:27.458 --> 35:31.629
The enormity of that is,
it's just kind of mind blowing.

35:32.338 --> 35:35.842
<i>Rodney Alcala died on July 24, 2021,</i>

35:35.925 --> 35:39.053
<i>while still on death row</i>
<i>in California prison.</i>

35:40.304 --> 35:43.307
Nobody ever needs to worry
about Rodney Alcala every again.

35:43.724 --> 35:48.146

STERLING NORRIS: <i>I don't think he feels</i>
<i>for one minute any remorse,</i>

36:03.494 --> 36:04.662
<i>uh, for any of this.</i>

36:05.079 --> 36:07.915
<i>Law enforcement took him off</i>
<i>the streets a bloody killer,</i>

36:07.999 --> 36:11.002
<i>uh, and I think he will go</i>
<i>to his execution that way.</i>

36:11.711 --> 36:15.590
MURPHY: <i>Fourteen years after he was</i>
<i>sentenced to death,</i>

36:15.673 --> 36:19.468
William Bonin was
finally up for execution.

36:21.053 --> 36:23.389
DAVID MCVICKER: <i>I got a phone call</i>
<i>one day when I was at work.</i>

36:23.472 --> 36:25.766
I heard that the execution was going on.

36:29.145 --> 36:31.647
David McVicker was the last victim

36:31.731 --> 36:33.149
that Bonin allowed to live.

36:34.817 --> 36:36.360
<i>He was looking for closure.</i>

36:37.612 --> 36:38.988
<i>That affected his whole life.</i>

36:40.489 --> 36:42.742
I wanted to change my mental videotape

36:42.825 --> 36:45.494
because I was having horrible nightmares
all the time.

36:45.578 --> 36:48.581
<i>I'm trying to keep busy</i>
<i>until the time comes.</i>

36:49.123 --> 36:52.210
<i>I-- this is a very,</i>
<i>very hard thing for me to do.</i>

36:52.293 --> 36:55.379
<i>It's, it's been very draining.</i>
<i>I haven't had sleep in days.</i>

36:55.463 --> 36:57.506
And I just thought that if I saw him die

36:57.590 --> 36:59.467
even though I don't want to see
an execution, you know,

36:59.550 --> 37:01.302
I don't want to see somebody die.

37:01.719 --> 37:03.971
But for him though,
it was a little bit different

37:04.055 --> 37:06.641
because he was killing me all the time.

37:06.724 --> 37:10.311
I wanted to see it just so I could change

37:10.394 --> 37:11.812
how I sleep at night.

37:12.730 --> 37:15.566
FLOYD: <i>William Bonin was finally set</i>
<i>to be executed</i>

37:15.650 --> 37:18.819
<i>on February 23, 1996.</i>

37:18.903 --> 37:22.240
Detective Robert Souza
was determined to be there,

37:22.615 --> 37:26.452
<i>but his partner, John St. John,</i>
<i>had already passed away.</i>

37:29.038 --> 37:31.707
SOUZA: <i>I showed up five o'clock</i>
<i>at the prison.</i>

37:34.377 --> 37:38.130
I get up there, I walk in
and the scene itself,

37:38.214 --> 37:41.300
<i>I always describe it</i>
<i>as somewhere between a wake</i>

37:41.926 --> 37:43.010
<i>and a wedding reception.</i>

37:43.094 --> 37:44.595
<i>It was very strange.</i>

37:45.054 --> 37:47.765
<i>All the ladies, the victims,</i>
<i>some of them I recognized,</i>

37:47.848 --> 37:51.394
victim's mothers wore pictures
of their sons

37:51.477 --> 37:52.937
who were victims on their dresses.

37:55.773 --> 37:56.941
They took us into the prison,

37:57.024 --> 37:59.026
myself and Sandy Miller,
one of the mothers.

37:59.652 --> 38:02.571
<i>Her son was murdered.</i>
<i>His name was Russell Rugh.</i>

38:03.614 --> 38:05.491
<i>She was devastated.</i>

38:06.242 --> 38:09.161
<i>It tore her apart to the core.</i>

38:10.705 --> 38:12.915
<i>Nobody's ever gonna bring me back my boy,</i>

38:12.999 --> 38:15.251
<i>any of the other kids. </i>(sobs)

38:15.334 --> 38:17.503
<i>The only thing different</i>
<i>is Bonin will be dead,</i>

38:17.586 --> 38:19.380
<i>and he can't hurt anybody else's.</i>

38:29.181 --> 38:31.183
SOUZA: <i>So we're all in there,</i>
<i>and the curtains were closed</i>

38:31.267 --> 38:33.185
<i>on the actual death chamber where he was.</i>

38:37.356 --> 38:39.025
MCVICKER: <i>They open up the curtains,</i>

38:40.693 --> 38:43.612
and I just wanted to see the evil go dead.

38:46.032 --> 38:50.119
The IV for the, uh, the triple injection
they give him

38:50.578 --> 38:52.455
<i>was all covered with a big bandage.</i>

38:52.872 --> 38:55.333
<i>He was just lying very still.</i>

38:56.334 --> 38:59.337
And then finally
his lips went phrrr, like that.

38:59.420 --> 39:01.464
And that was the last of his air
leaving his body.

39:04.967 --> 39:08.721
John had died just a year and a half
before Bonin was executed.

39:09.263 --> 39:11.057
<i>It would have meant a lot</i>
<i>to John to be there.</i>

39:14.185 --> 39:16.312
<i>I said what John asked me to say,</i>

39:18.606 --> 39:20.316
"Adios, you son of a bitch."

39:24.111 --> 39:27.656
When we all walked out after,
it was total silence.

39:28.199 --> 39:30.409
All the victims' families, they just,

39:30.493 --> 39:31.786
I don't think they knew how to act.

39:34.246 --> 39:36.499
They were relieved after all these years

39:37.041 --> 39:38.084
but were they happy?

39:38.167 --> 39:39.627
Were they-- was this enough for them?

39:39.710 --> 39:41.545
I didn't know what to say to these people.

39:41.629 --> 39:44.131
You know, I didn't want to say,
"Gee, that was good, huh?

39:44.215 --> 39:45.508
We got rid of that son of a bitch."

39:45.591 --> 39:47.593
You don't-- it's--it's not like that.

39:48.928 --> 39:51.138
I think he deserved a lot worse

39:51.222 --> 39:52.640
than what happened to him.

39:52.723 --> 39:54.350
And he lost his life, yeah.

39:54.433 --> 39:57.561
<i>But he had it easy</i>
<i>compared to everybody else.</i>

39:57.645 --> 39:59.063
<i>For him, it was like having a surgery.</i>

39:59.146 --> 40:00.815
<i>They put him to sleep, and he was gone.</i>

40:02.191 --> 40:04.360
And when the subject comes up,
I think about it

40:04.443 --> 40:06.612
and, you know, I have nightmares.

40:07.196 --> 40:09.532
It seems to almost never stop.

40:12.868 --> 40:16.414
SOUZA: <i>The Freeway Killer case,</i>
<i>it was more full circle to me.</i>

40:18.290 --> 40:20.626
I'd roll out on these dead body calls,

40:20.709 --> 40:22.169
and now I've taken it full circle

40:22.253 --> 40:25.464
to watch the guy who did it actually die.

40:27.258 --> 40:29.635
<i>I think today I realize</i>

40:29.718 --> 40:32.179
<i>the significance more than I did then.</i>

40:33.055 --> 40:36.267
We didn't have time to philosophize.
(chuckles)

40:36.350 --> 40:37.726
It was what we had to do.

40:38.269 --> 40:40.104
Let's get the son of a bitch, you know.

40:40.187 --> 40:41.856
Let's get him, let's get him
and put him in jail

40:41.939 --> 40:42.982
so he can't do it anymore.

40:44.150 --> 40:45.943
Pretty simple concept. And we did it.

40:55.661 --> 40:58.038
PATT MORRISON:
<i>When you go into all of these cases,</i>

40:59.415 --> 41:03.002
you see what was done to
the victims and their families.

41:06.213 --> 41:09.717
<i>These people had big dreams</i>
<i>to make a life for themselves.</i>

41:11.218 --> 41:14.972
<i>They deserved that chance to be</i>
<i>who they wanted to be.</i>

41:17.558 --> 41:19.393
<i>In the long run and the bigger sense,</i>

41:19.477 --> 41:21.979
<i>we should try not to remember the killers</i>

41:22.062 --> 41:23.689
<i>but to remember their victims.</i>

41:24.648 --> 41:28.319
<i>That should be the legacy of these times.</i>

41:30.571 --> 41:33.949
These cases are a form of trauma.

41:34.575 --> 41:36.827
And these guys that are working

41:37.661 --> 41:40.498
<i>for decades on these cases,</i>

41:40.581 --> 41:43.584
<i>no matter how gruff they come off,</i>

41:44.335 --> 41:46.170
<i>it's still inside of them.</i>

41:46.253 --> 41:47.505
<i>It will never go away.</i>

41:50.007 --> 41:53.135
There isn't that, um, high five moment.

41:53.469 --> 41:58.140
It's just almost sad, you know,
why does this exist?

42:01.101 --> 42:03.979
MURPHY: <i>These detectives really</i>
<i>were the pioneers</i>

42:04.063 --> 42:06.899
<i>of the modern era</i>
<i>of homicide investigations.</i>

42:07.983 --> 42:11.612
Being a prosecutor who reaped
the benefit of that for 17 years,

42:11.695 --> 42:15.282
I got to work with the,
with the second wave of these guys

42:16.033 --> 42:17.493
<i>who learned from the Tom Langes,</i>

42:17.576 --> 42:19.745
<i>who learned from these</i>
<i>dedicated detectives.</i>

42:22.915 --> 42:27.044
Today, in your life, you know people
that weren't murdered

42:27.378 --> 42:31.215
<i>because of the work that these detectives</i>
<i>accomplished.</i>

42:35.427 --> 42:38.097
The world is a far safer place today

42:38.180 --> 42:40.432
because of the work of those detectives.

42:42.643 --> 42:46.021
MICHAEL CONNELLY: <i>I don't think</i>
<i>we'll ever see that time again.</i>

42:48.232 --> 42:52.236
Yes, there is always
horrible tragic, uh, victims

42:52.319 --> 42:54.113
and, and stories like that,

42:54.196 --> 42:55.656
<i>but they could have been far worse</i>

42:55.739 --> 42:57.700
<i>if it was not for these detectives.</i>

43:05.291 --> 43:08.669
<i>They made this place safer</i>
<i>for many people through their work.</i>

43:09.086 --> 43:12.673
But I, I don't think they worry
about being thanked for it.

43:14.300 --> 43:15.759
<i>They all know what they did.</i>

43:16.969 --> 43:20.639
You know, looking back at this so-called
serial killing era,

43:21.140 --> 43:23.142
no matter how you want to talk about them,

43:23.225 --> 43:24.476
we solved every one of them.

43:24.560 --> 43:26.186
Every one of them been solved.

43:26.270 --> 43:28.856
LANGE: And I think
we all respected what we did

43:28.939 --> 43:31.066
for all those years was a success,

43:31.150 --> 43:33.861
and I think we're damn glad
we picked this as a career.

43:34.570 --> 43:37.281
Thinking back what I really feel
proud about is

43:37.364 --> 43:39.575
people wanted justice
for all those killings.

43:39.825 --> 43:41.577
Uh, that's what I feel good about.

43:42.286 --> 43:44.121
Personally, I think
I had a pretty good run.

43:44.580 --> 43:46.415
Uh, put a lot of bad guys in jail.

43:46.874 --> 43:48.250
I'm pretty proud to say that, uh,

43:48.334 --> 43:50.377
just about every murderer
I went after I got.

43:50.878 --> 43:52.504
I'm proud of the guys I worked with.

43:52.588 --> 43:54.840
Probably the finest group
of investigators anywhere.

43:56.258 --> 43:57.676
Pretty proud to be part of that.

43:58.302 --> 44:01.889
GARCIA: The most satisfaction I achieved
was solving the cases,

44:01.972 --> 44:04.975
closure for a lot of the
families that we could bring.

44:05.351 --> 44:07.811
Sometimes you, you talk to the mother,

44:07.895 --> 44:09.647
the father, the wife, whoever

44:10.064 --> 44:12.441
and after you solve the case
and they looked you in the eye

44:12.524 --> 44:14.109
and they go like this, thank you.

44:14.443 --> 44:16.070
And they mean it
from the bottom of their heart.

44:16.153 --> 44:17.071
LEFROIS: Yeah.

44:17.154 --> 44:20.115
And that means
more than anything in the world.

44:20.407 --> 44:23.243
I know a lot of cops from
the New York Police Department.

44:23.327 --> 44:26.246
I grew up in that back--
that part of the world.

44:26.330 --> 44:28.874
And I know what
the New York policemen thought

44:28.957 --> 44:31.168
of the Los Angeles Police Department.

44:31.251 --> 44:34.546
My buddy says,
you guys were the innovators.

44:34.630 --> 44:35.964
But most of all,

44:36.048 --> 44:38.967
you are the ultimate
investigative professionals

44:39.051 --> 44:40.135
in this country.

44:40.594 --> 44:41.970
I'm very proud of that.

44:42.680 --> 44:43.972
I love you guys.

44:44.056 --> 44:45.808
You're--you're brothers.

44:46.767 --> 44:47.768
You are the best.

44:48.394 --> 44:50.145
And I want to make a special toast

44:51.063 --> 44:52.523
to Robbery Homicide Division

44:52.606 --> 44:56.110
and all the detective agencies
in the City of Los Angeles.

44:56.193 --> 44:57.069
God bless you all.

44:57.152 --> 44:58.153
-Hear, hear.
-Cheers.

44:58.237 --> 44:59.196
-Hear, hear.
-Hear, hear.

GROGAN: <i>I don't feel like, uh...</i>

45:10.416 --> 45:11.875
(clears throat, sniffles)

45:11.959 --> 45:13.419
the book has been closed.

45:13.502 --> 45:14.753
It never will.

45:16.130 --> 45:19.633
<i>I could never,</i>
<i>even to this day, understand</i>

45:20.008 --> 45:22.094
<i>why somebody would want to kill somebody.</i>

45:23.721 --> 45:27.057
Nobody deserves to die like that.

45:28.642 --> 45:30.269
<i>But there is justice.</i>

45:30.728 --> 45:33.564
Thank God. Justice was served.
