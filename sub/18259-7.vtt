43:28.675 --> 43:30.035
-What?

43:30.036 --> 43:32.237
- He fucked up.
[ Sighs ]

43:32.238 --> 43:34.760
All this time
working that woman.

43:34.761 --> 43:38.244
I fucking found her,
he couldn't close the deal.

43:39.806 --> 43:41.967
-What a pussy.

43:41.968 --> 43:44.290
-Yeah.

43:56.102 --> 43:59.785
I'm gonna make everything
all right.

43:59.786 --> 44:01.868
I'm gonna get us
that fucking money.

44:04.591 --> 44:08.995
You got any more
of that South American shit?

[ Knock on door ]
Hey.

44:54.000 --> 44:55.521
-Emma's dead.

44:55.522 --> 44:58.323
-What?

44:58.324 --> 45:00.766
Jesus.

45:00.767 --> 45:03.128
How?

45:03.129 --> 45:04.690
-Some kid at school told me

45:04.691 --> 45:08.093
she O. D.'d
on some South American drug.

45:08.094 --> 45:12.417
They found her buried
in the Angeles Crest Mountains.

45:12.418 --> 45:15.060
-[ Sighs ] I'm sorry.

45:15.061 --> 45:18.103
-No, you're not.

45:18.104 --> 45:21.106
You and mom don't want to help.

45:21.107 --> 45:23.228
You don't care.

45:23.229 --> 45:24.590
You just want
to protect yourself...

45:24.591 --> 45:26.552
This shitty business you run.

45:26.553 --> 45:28.033
-What are you talking about?

45:28.034 --> 45:29.995
- I want to tell the police
the truth, Dad.

45:29.996 --> 45:31.076
Everything.
- The truth?

45:31.077 --> 45:32.678
- I've run it all
through my mind.

45:32.679 --> 45:34.600
The day she was here,
the day everyone was here...

45:34.601 --> 45:37.563
Me, you, Mom... we all
got questioned, all of us.

45:37.564 --> 45:40.205
All of us
but that client of yours...

45:40.206 --> 45:41.647
The woman with the Jaguar.

45:41.648 --> 45:45.050
- Oh, now, son,
I... I know you're hurting,

45:45.051 --> 45:48.133
but that... that woman
had nothing to do with this.

45:48.134 --> 45:49.855
-You don't know!

45:49.856 --> 45:51.336
She could have
seen something, Dad!

45:51.337 --> 45:53.498
- If she had seen
something strange,

45:53.499 --> 45:56.501
she would have told...
- How do you know?!

45:56.502 --> 45:59.585
Your clients
are not exactly solid citizens.

45:59.586 --> 46:03.709
-This one is.

46:03.710 --> 46:05.150
[ Sighs ]

46:05.151 --> 46:09.555
She's just a sad, rich woman
from San Marino,

46:09.556 --> 46:11.717
and she didn't have anything
to do with this.

46:11.718 --> 46:14.320
I promise.

46:15.642 --> 46:19.565
♫♫

46:19.566 --> 46:22.087

left her alone, Dad.
