00:30.063 --> 00:32.063
Ha!

01:28.254 --> 01:30.254
What is this?

01:36.763 --> 01:38.763
Uh!

01:39.466 --> 01:42.271
Good hands, Nedderman.
Take a lap.

01:44.971 --> 01:48.832
By itself, a basketball
is just a round sack of air.

01:48.842 --> 01:50.300
Like many of you.

01:50.310 --> 01:52.602
But in the hands of
someone properly trained...

01:52.612 --> 01:54.170
in its use and skilled in its art...

01:54.180 --> 01:56.774
this ball can do great things.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.142
Oates, I can hear you
wheezing from here.

01:59.152 --> 02:01.532
Take a lap. Lose the asthma.

02:02.655 --> 02:04.747
To survive
outside these walls...

02:04.757 --> 02:07.083
you need more than
just math and science.

02:07.093 --> 02:08.418
The world does not stop...

02:08.428 --> 02:09.953
for people who can spell
fancy words...

02:09.963 --> 02:11.654
or tell you
the capital of Montana.

02:11.664 --> 02:13.656
The capital of Montana, Watson?

02:13.666 --> 02:16.471
- Helena?
- Who cares? Take a lap.

02:17.570 --> 02:20.930
The only thing that matters
in this world, ladies, is strength.

02:20.940 --> 02:23.500
Strength of body
and strength of mind.

02:23.510 --> 02:24.801
Now if you're not
strong enough...

02:24.811 --> 02:26.369
by the time you leave
these doors...

02:26.379 --> 02:29.973
you may as well give up
and go home to your mommas.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.475
Or grandma.
Put your hand down, Lewis.

02:32.485 --> 02:36.310
We all know your parents died.
Give it a rest.

02:40.760 --> 02:43.735
- Oh!
- Pick up the pace, Nedderman.

02:45.465 --> 02:47.891
Well, Farley, it looks like you
forgot your gym clothes again.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.459
No, sir, somebody--

02:49.469 --> 02:51.060
It's a rhetorical question,
Farley.

02:51.070 --> 02:52.595
- What?
- It's a rhetorical question.

02:52.605 --> 02:54.631
That means you don't have
to answer it.

02:54.641 --> 02:56.432
Because either
I already know the answer...

02:56.442 --> 02:58.768
or I don't care
what your answer is.

02:58.778 --> 03:00.436
You see, in my class, Farley...

03:00.446 --> 03:03.940
everyone is required to wear
regulation gym shorts and shirt.

03:03.950 --> 03:06.885
Gutierrez, go get the rentals.

03:06.920 --> 03:09.081
Start changing.

03:09.122 --> 03:11.420
- No, in line.
- What?

03:11.457 --> 03:13.249
See, the locker room
is reserved...

03:13.259 --> 03:16.186
for people who brought
the appropriate attire.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.454
- You change here.
- It's OK, John. Be strong.

03:18.464 --> 03:21.024
No talking, Nedderman. 10 laps.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.195
Take Wheezy with you.

03:25.138 --> 03:27.138
Come on, let's go.

03:36.649 --> 03:38.875
The rentals, Farley,
that's 25 cents.

03:38.885 --> 03:41.578
- But somebody stole my--
- I--I didn't ask you a question, Farley.

03:41.588 --> 03:43.580
- Not even a rhetorical one.
- Uh...

03:43.590 --> 03:46.316
It seems to me
that someone needs a lesson...

03:46.326 --> 03:48.621
in personal responsibility.

03:49.762 --> 03:52.196
Not even one chin-up,
Farley?

03:52.232 --> 03:53.489
Can't hang on!

03:53.499 --> 03:55.291
You are a disgrace to fat...

03:55.301 --> 03:58.828
gelatinous, out-of-shape
little kids the world over.

03:58.838 --> 04:01.898
I don't tolerate losers
in my gymnasium.

04:01.908 --> 04:04.801
- Are you gonna be a loser?
- No, sir.

04:04.811 --> 04:08.438
Rhetorical, Farley.
I already know the answer.

04:08.448 --> 04:10.448
Heads up, Nedderman.

04:11.150 --> 04:13.150
Uh!

04:15.054 --> 04:17.647
Don't you even think
about letting go.

04:17.656 --> 04:19.656
Uh!

04:28.101 --> 04:29.726
- You guys ready to let go?
- Yeah!

04:29.736 --> 04:30.727
All right!

04:30.737 --> 04:32.095
- Mr. Farley?
- Oh, sure. How you doing?

04:32.105 --> 04:33.663
- All right, what's your name?
- Scott.

04:33.673 --> 04:34.864
John, you don't have
time for this.

04:34.874 --> 04:36.332
- Oh...
- Bye-bye.

04:36.342 --> 04:37.433
I'm sorry, guys.

04:37.443 --> 04:40.078
- Keep letting go.
- John! John!

04:41.981 --> 04:44.474
OK, now remember they're
all potential stalkers.

04:44.484 --> 04:46.142
Most want an autograph
and a handshake...

04:46.152 --> 04:48.344
but some of them want an
autograph and a handshake...

04:48.354 --> 04:50.113
and then they want to
take you home, tie you up...

04:50.123 --> 04:51.914
and saw your feet off.

04:51.924 --> 04:54.350
- Well, hi there.
- John Farley.

04:54.360 --> 04:56.219
Your book saved my life.

04:56.229 --> 04:58.521
I didn't do anything.
You did it.

04:58.531 --> 05:00.790
All I did was
give you the raft.

05:00.800 --> 05:02.558
- You had to inflate it yourself.
- Mm-hm.

05:02.568 --> 05:06.829
Mr. Farley, I used to feel
ostracized because of my weight.

05:06.839 --> 05:10.133
But with your help I'm starting
to get my self-confidence back.

05:10.143 --> 05:11.567
Ha! That's a great story.

05:11.577 --> 05:13.636
Why don't you check out
the free coffee and donuts?

05:13.646 --> 05:15.204
Oh!

05:15.214 --> 05:20.550
By letting go, do you mean we
should just forget everything?

05:20.586 --> 05:22.779
My mom said he wouldn't drink
so much...

05:22.789 --> 05:25.715
if he could just forget about that summer
in Uncle Lou's house.

05:25.725 --> 05:27.650
Well, we all have
an Uncle Lou.

05:27.660 --> 05:30.890
And we all drink
for different reasons.

05:30.930 --> 05:32.855
Long day.

05:32.865 --> 05:35.124
I don't even think I can hold
a pen anymore.

05:35.134 --> 05:37.460
Let me give you the same advice
I gave Nelson Mandela...

05:37.470 --> 05:39.395
on his last book tour.

05:39.405 --> 05:41.264
Quit whining, you pussy.

05:41.274 --> 05:43.766
- That's helpful.
- You have no idea...

05:43.776 --> 05:45.501
the stuff that
I am saving you from.

05:45.511 --> 05:48.304
Some shithole in Nebraska
wanted to give you...

05:48.314 --> 05:51.943
their corn husk bucket
or something.

05:51.984 --> 05:54.179
The Corn Cob Key?

05:54.220 --> 05:56.979
Uh, is that what it is?
I--I don't know."The Forest--

05:56.989 --> 05:59.015
"...Meadow Nebraska
Chamber of Commerce...

05:59.025 --> 06:03.553
"wishes to award Mr. John Farley
the Corn Cob Key to the City."

06:03.563 --> 06:05.555
Oh, my God. This is my hometown.

06:05.565 --> 06:07.857
- This is awesome. What did you tell them?
- I told them yes.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.292
- Really?
- No.

06:09.302 --> 06:10.426
Why? Wait.

06:10.436 --> 06:13.529
Maggie, the Corn Cob Key
is a huge honor.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.164
They hardly ever
give it out anymore...

06:15.174 --> 06:18.701
but when they do it's the
highlight of the whole cornival.

06:18.711 --> 06:20.370
I'm sorry.
Did you just say cornival?

06:20.380 --> 06:23.144
Well, yeah. It's a farm town...

06:23.182 --> 06:27.687
so, you know, every year
we have this big celebration.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.479
Corn carnival. Cornival.

06:29.489 --> 06:31.914
- Cornival.
- Maggie, you don't understand.

06:31.924 --> 06:34.117
My mom was Corn Cob Queen
in 1970.

06:34.127 --> 06:36.152
I mean, she still rides
in the parade every year.

06:36.162 --> 06:38.621
- This will mean so much to her.
- Cornival?

06:38.631 --> 06:40.390
You know what?
Call them back.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.658
I could fly in tomorrow
and surprise her. It's perfect.

06:42.668 --> 06:46.429
You would need a court order
to make me go see my mom.

06:46.439 --> 06:50.299
This is different. Since my dad
died, I'm all she's got.

06:50.309 --> 06:52.235
Oh, your dad's dead?

06:52.245 --> 06:54.404
It's a major theme of my book.

06:54.414 --> 06:59.174
The whole last chapter's
about how I let go of that pain.

07:00.052 --> 07:02.245
You haven't read my book,
have you?

07:02.255 --> 07:06.845
Well, there's no point now.
You just ruined the ending.

07:22.341 --> 07:24.341
Hi, John!

07:29.415 --> 07:31.975
Welcome home, John. Ha ha ha!

07:32.018 --> 07:34.644
Luke Jessop, uh, Forest Meadow
Town Council.

07:34.654 --> 07:38.181
We appreciate you taking time
out of your busy schedule...

07:38.191 --> 07:40.216
to--to--to come home and see
the little people.

07:40.226 --> 07:42.118
Thank you. This is great.

07:42.128 --> 07:44.754
It's an honor to be considered
worthy of the Corn Cob Key.

07:44.764 --> 07:47.399
Well, you've earned it, young--

07:47.900 --> 07:50.660
Young man.
We are mighty proud of you.

07:50.670 --> 07:53.230
So on behalf of--of--

07:53.272 --> 07:56.764
Well, of all of us, John...

07:56.809 --> 07:59.444
- Corn-gratulations!
- Ha ha ha!

08:16.963 --> 08:20.490
...Famous award-winning corn chowder--

08:31.911 --> 08:34.370
- Johnny! Oh, my God, you're here!
- Hey!

08:34.380 --> 08:35.837
- How are you?
- Oh!

08:35.847 --> 08:38.341
I heard your news and I tried to
call you but now you're here!

08:38.351 --> 08:40.243
I was flying in.
I wanted to surprise you.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.010
- Oh! I am so proud of you.
- Thank you, Mom.

08:42.020 --> 08:43.645
How's it going?
Is the book tour good?

08:43.655 --> 08:45.381
- Yeah, it's good.
- Are you having fun?

08:45.391 --> 08:46.749
Yeah, I'm happy. You look great.

08:46.759 --> 08:48.417
- Thanks.
- Yeah. You going somewhere?

08:48.427 --> 08:50.253
Yeah. I have a date.

08:50.263 --> 08:51.721
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:51.731 --> 08:53.356
- A--Are you seeing someone?
- Yeah.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.825
Oh, my God. That's fantastic.
For how long?

08:55.835 --> 08:58.127
- 5 months.
- What? Why didn't you mention it?

08:58.137 --> 09:00.029
Oh, because you don't like
to hear when I have a date.

09:00.039 --> 09:02.465
- Oh, well, so what's he like?
- Oh, he's great.

09:02.475 --> 09:06.335
He's so handsome and he's--
he's sweet and consid--

09:06.345 --> 09:09.105
- He's a gentleman.
- Oh, Mom, I'm so happy for you.

09:09.115 --> 09:10.573
- Thanks.
- I can't wait to meet him.

09:10.583 --> 09:12.875
- You know, you know him already.
- I do?

09:12.885 --> 09:14.885
Yeah.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.466
Mr. Woodcock?

09:35.408 --> 09:38.298
Farley, I brought you
some daisies.

09:38.511 --> 09:41.401
- Jasper!
- Sorry, I'm late, honey.

09:42.014 --> 09:43.940
That's OK.

09:43.950 --> 09:46.248
Uh, this is Johnny.

09:46.285 --> 09:49.083
My son.
Do you remember him now?

09:49.121 --> 09:51.121
No.

09:51.524 --> 09:53.583
- But I've heard a lot.
- Hm.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.052
It's not every day you get to
shake hands with a celebrity.

09:56.062 --> 09:58.062
Ha ha ha!

09:58.598 --> 10:00.823
- Uh, you ready for dinner?
- Mm-hm.

10:00.833 --> 10:02.191
I don't know
about you...

10:02.201 --> 10:06.111
but I've been thinking
about meat all day long.

10:08.307 --> 10:10.833
I can't believe
you don't remember him.

10:10.843 --> 10:12.301
He was the cutest kid.

10:12.311 --> 10:14.370
About this high
with his chubby little cheeks.

10:14.380 --> 10:17.540
- Mom.
- I had a lot of fat kids over the years.

10:17.550 --> 10:19.609
Oh, he wasn't fat!

10:19.652 --> 10:21.648
Wait a minute.

10:21.658 --> 10:23.654
It's coming back to me.

10:23.689 --> 10:25.915
You're not that kid
that got the squirts...

10:25.925 --> 10:27.350
on the balance beam
that time, were you?

10:27.360 --> 10:29.658
- Jasper.
- No.

10:31.197 --> 10:33.589
Actually I remember you
pretty well.

10:33.599 --> 10:35.791
You kinda gave me a lot of
personal attention back then.

10:35.801 --> 10:38.894
- Aw.
- Well, I take a healthy interest in the kids.

10:38.904 --> 10:40.763
Serves them well
later in life.

10:40.773 --> 10:44.233
Oh, that's so true, that's
so true. And that is why...

10:44.243 --> 10:48.270
they're making Jasper
the Educator of the Year.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.840
- You're kidding!
- Why would she be kidding?

10:50.850 --> 10:54.276
Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh!
You know what I just realized?

10:54.286 --> 10:58.780
Both of my fellas are being
honored in the same week.

10:58.824 --> 11:03.386
They're giving Johnny
the Corn Cob Key.

11:04.430 --> 11:05.921
You're kidding.

11:05.931 --> 11:09.792
So I'm doing laps at the Y
and he's in the next lane...

11:09.802 --> 11:13.696
and all of a sudden my leg
seizes up and I go under.

11:13.706 --> 11:17.333
It was a bad cramp.
And if I remember correctly...

11:17.343 --> 11:19.343
I think it was about...

11:19.378 --> 11:21.676
- Right here.
- Ha ha ha.

11:23.716 --> 11:26.042
Ahem. So he saved
your life, then?

11:26.052 --> 11:28.277
Well, it was
the shallow end.

11:28.287 --> 11:30.212
You can drown
in six inches of water.

11:30.222 --> 11:31.747
- That is so true.
- Hm.

11:31.757 --> 11:34.282
Well, if you will
excuse me...

11:34.326 --> 11:37.019
I am going to, uh,
the ladies room.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.224
You boys behave yourself.

11:43.069 --> 11:45.279
So what's your book about?

11:45.871 --> 11:48.533
Oh. Um...

11:48.574 --> 11:51.167
well, it teaches people how to
release painful memories...

11:51.177 --> 11:53.402
so they can rebuild
their self-esteem.

11:53.412 --> 11:55.304
It's called Letting Go.
How To Get Past Your Past.

11:55.314 --> 11:57.646
I'm already past my past.

11:57.683 --> 12:00.277
That's why
it's called my past.

12:00.319 --> 12:02.478
Well, some people
find my book helpful.

12:02.488 --> 12:05.208
Lot of losers out there,
I guess.

12:06.959 --> 12:11.828
Well, would you like
an espresso, er, cappuccino...?

12:11.864 --> 12:13.923
- Um, a cup--
- Just the check.

12:13.933 --> 12:16.299
Oh, OK.

12:17.002 --> 12:18.961
Thanks, guys.

12:18.971 --> 12:20.730
Um, my treat.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.631
You're the guest.
I'll take care of it.

12:22.641 --> 12:24.641
No, really, it's fine.

12:24.677 --> 12:26.368
I can afford it.

12:26.378 --> 12:28.503
So you're saying I can't?

12:29.515 --> 12:31.040
No, of course not.

12:31.050 --> 12:36.320
Well, then, why don't you take
your own advice and, uh, let go?

12:38.057 --> 12:41.032
Thank you, Jasper.
That is so sweet.

12:42.061 --> 12:45.376
Johnny, don't you have
something to say?

12:46.899 --> 12:48.899
Thank you.

12:49.135 --> 12:51.135
Don't mention it.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.997
- Ha ha ha.
- I swear to God it's true.

12:55.007 --> 12:58.465
No, no, no. No. No.
Thank you, honey.

12:58.511 --> 13:02.238
No, I don't believe you.
You did not beat Santa Claus up.

13:02.248 --> 13:04.807
- Stop it.
- I was 7 years old at the time.

13:04.817 --> 13:07.109
And some kids at school told me
that there's no Santa Claus.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.144
Uh-huh?

13:08.154 --> 13:09.912
Well, on Christmas Eve
when I come downstairs...

13:09.922 --> 13:11.847
and see some guy messing around
under the Christmas tree...

13:11.857 --> 13:13.149
I go to my dad's closet...

13:13.159 --> 13:14.183
- and get a three wood--
- Oh, no!

13:14.193 --> 13:15.985
And next thing you know,
Uncle Bob's in the hospital.

13:15.995 --> 13:18.225
No! Oh, poor Uncle Bob.

13:18.264 --> 13:20.089
Ate the entire Christmas dinner
through a straw that year.

13:20.099 --> 13:21.624
- No!
- Yeah.

13:21.634 --> 13:23.630
What a great story.

13:23.640 --> 13:25.694
Well, I guess we'd better
call it a night.

13:25.704 --> 13:28.130
It's good to see you,
Mr. Woodcock.

13:28.140 --> 13:31.567
Well, I guess I could let you
have her for one night, Farley.

13:31.577 --> 13:33.068
Probably good for
the old hip flexor...

13:33.078 --> 13:34.270
to take a night off anyway, huh?

13:34.280 --> 13:36.942
- Jasper!
- Ha ha ha! Yeah.

13:36.982 --> 13:41.043
That was a fun night.
Come on, you guys!

13:41.086 --> 13:44.715
You guys! Ooooohhhhhh! Mmmm!

13:49.195 --> 13:51.320
- I'll call you tomorrow, honey.
- OK.

13:51.330 --> 13:52.755
- Farley.
- Yep.

13:52.765 --> 13:54.765
Mr. Woodcock.

13:59.839 --> 14:03.036
And he is just so easy to be with.

14:03.075 --> 14:07.671
Last month...
we went camping.

14:07.713 --> 14:09.772
- You hate camping.
- I know!

14:09.782 --> 14:12.141
I mean, it was just the 2 of us for 3 days...

14:12.151 --> 14:13.676
and it was heaven.

14:13.686 --> 14:16.154
Ha ha ha. It was great.

14:16.188 --> 14:18.188
Wow.

14:19.725 --> 14:21.725
Johnny, um...

14:22.628 --> 14:25.154
this is really the first guy
since your father...

14:25.164 --> 14:28.531
that...has felt right.

14:30.336 --> 14:32.336
I'll get you some milk.

14:34.840 --> 14:37.570
Oh! Look what I've got.

14:39.812 --> 14:41.812
Chocolate, please.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.475
I had a lot of fat kids over the years.

14:46.485 --> 14:48.744
- This is Johnny.
- A lot of fat kids.

14:48.754 --> 14:49.912
Remember him now?

14:49.922 --> 14:51.981
No. A lot of losers out there, I guess.

14:51.991 --> 14:53.991
Arrgh!

14:57.863 --> 14:59.488
Probably good
for the old hip flexor...

14:59.498 --> 15:02.983
to take a night off anyway, huh?
Ha ha ha!

15:25.424 --> 15:27.424
When did you get here?

15:29.161 --> 15:33.241
About 10 minutes after you said
good night to me.

15:35.167 --> 15:37.593
Not even one chin-up, Farley?

15:37.603 --> 15:39.895
You are a disgrace to fat...

15:39.905 --> 15:44.240
gelatinous, out-of-shape
little kids the world over.

15:46.946 --> 15:50.686
- Can I get a glass of water, please?
- Sure.

15:55.020 --> 15:57.020
Son of a bitch!

16:00.793 --> 16:03.003
- I'm sorry.
- John Farley?

16:04.330 --> 16:07.122
- Nedderman?
- I can't believe it's really you!

16:07.132 --> 16:09.325
I've read your book like 900 times...

16:09.335 --> 16:10.492
and I'm not just saying this...

16:10.502 --> 16:12.528
it's totally changed my life!

16:12.538 --> 16:14.229
Really? That's great, man.

16:14.239 --> 16:16.732
Hell, yeah.
I work here full-time...

16:16.742 --> 16:19.401
and also I'm starting
my own pool cleaning business.

16:19.411 --> 16:22.771
All I've got so far is a van but--but
at least it's a start, right?

16:22.781 --> 16:24.640
Well, every journey
has to start somewhere.

16:24.650 --> 16:27.710
Chapter 2.
You're totally right.

16:27.753 --> 16:29.753
Totally right.

16:34.693 --> 16:36.952
Can you believe it?
The Woodcock pan pizza?

16:36.962 --> 16:39.054
What's next,
the Hitler calzone?

16:39.064 --> 16:40.856
Yeah, well, you're never
gonna believe this.

16:40.866 --> 16:43.192
Mr. Deepdish
is dating my mom.

16:43.202 --> 16:46.069
Woodcock?
He's doing your mom?

16:46.105 --> 16:48.097
- Wait. I wouldn't say doing--
- Hear that, Mitch?

16:48.107 --> 16:49.832
Woodcock's slamming
his mom!

16:49.842 --> 16:51.266
- You don't have to announce it.
- Hey, guys!

16:51.276 --> 16:55.104
Check it out. Woodcock's
stuffing this dude's mom.

16:55.114 --> 16:56.672
Woodcock's pounding your mom?

16:56.682 --> 16:58.807
Hey, hey, guys, come on.
Show a little respect.

16:58.817 --> 17:01.477
How would you feel if Woodcock
was porking your mom?

17:01.487 --> 17:04.455
Woodcock's porking your mom!

17:04.490 --> 17:06.415
- Woodcock's porking your mom!
- Hey, shut your trap...

17:06.425 --> 17:08.183
or you're not getting
that cheesy bread!

17:08.193 --> 17:10.457
I want my cheesy bread!

17:10.496 --> 17:11.920
Then shut up!

17:11.930 --> 17:17.059
Keep your mouth shut and you get
your cheesy bread, all right?

17:17.069 --> 17:20.061
I'm sorry about that.
You want a slice on the house?

17:20.071 --> 17:21.930
Sausage and onion.
Extra sauce, right?

17:21.940 --> 17:23.766
No, I don't really eat
that stuff anymore.

17:23.776 --> 17:26.435
Yeah, yeah, I--I--I'd probably
lose my appetite too...

17:26.444 --> 17:28.537
if Woodcock was giving it
to my mom.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.913
The guy is pure evil.

17:30.949 --> 17:33.349
You know he killed Oates?

17:33.385 --> 17:34.810
- What?
- Yeah.

17:34.820 --> 17:37.446
Remember, Woodcock used to
make Oates do, like, 6 miles...

17:37.456 --> 17:39.281
every day after school?

17:39.291 --> 17:42.217
The guy had bad asthma, dude,
you can't just run through that.

17:42.227 --> 17:44.947
Holy shit.
Well, when did he die?

17:44.963 --> 17:48.873
A couple of years ago.
But it was all Woodcock.

17:49.601 --> 17:50.993
Ah--

17:51.003 --> 17:53.796
Man, look, we can't blame
Woodcock for Oates's choices.

17:53.806 --> 17:56.265
Oates coulda stopped
running, right?

17:56.275 --> 17:57.766
When you make
a blame sandwich...

17:57.776 --> 17:59.902
you gotta be prepared
to eat it yourself.

17:59.912 --> 18:02.642
Chapter 10.
You're totally right.

18:02.681 --> 18:05.912
So what are you gonna do?

18:05.951 --> 18:09.311
I think it's time
Woodcock and I had a talk.

18:09.321 --> 18:11.713
The shortest distance
between 2 people--

18:11.723 --> 18:13.719
Communication.

18:13.729 --> 18:16.819
God, you must get so laid.

18:20.899 --> 18:23.231
Farley, pass the ball.

18:23.268 --> 18:25.127
Not even one pull-up, Farley?

18:25.137 --> 18:26.895
Are you gonna be a loser, Farley?

18:26.905 --> 18:29.131
I don't tolerate losers
in my gymnasium.

18:29.141 --> 18:32.334
Now, before we begin our
exploration of wiffleball...

18:32.344 --> 18:36.084
I think a little equipment check
is in order.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.115
Well, Dunningham?

18:38.884 --> 18:40.943
Spread 'em, Dunningham.

18:46.558 --> 18:48.717
That's OK. I don't need to
see the cup, Dunningham.

18:48.727 --> 18:50.727
Keep it in your pants.

18:53.632 --> 18:57.359
You see, ladies, it's important
that you come prepared to class.

18:57.369 --> 18:59.161
Because when we're prepared...

18:59.171 --> 19:02.397
then we're ready to face
life's challenges.

19:02.407 --> 19:07.677
Well, Farley, let's see whether
or not you came prepared today.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.813
Spread 'em.

19:14.286 --> 19:17.601
Excuse me. Do you have
a visitors' pass?

19:18.624 --> 19:20.624
Tracy Dettweiler?

19:22.027 --> 19:24.553
- John Farley?
- Wh--You remember me?

19:24.563 --> 19:26.773
Well, yeah, you're famous!

19:27.566 --> 19:29.391
What are you doing here?

19:29.401 --> 19:32.261
Oh, gee...what are you doing here?

19:32.271 --> 19:34.466
Oh, I--I teach English.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.031
- Wow.
- Ha ha ha!

19:36.041 --> 19:37.966
I really wish I had you
as an English teacher.

19:37.976 --> 19:39.835
I would have paid
way more attention in class.

19:39.845 --> 19:43.005
Ha ha ha! Wait a minute.
What year were you in again?

19:43.015 --> 19:45.347
Uh, same as you, actually.

19:45.384 --> 19:47.142
- Really?
- Yeah. I was--

19:47.152 --> 19:50.637
I was actually
your 7th grade lab partner.

19:50.689 --> 19:52.714
Wait. Fat John?

19:52.758 --> 19:55.226
- No way! Fat John!
- Yeah.

19:55.260 --> 19:57.728
Yep, I was fat.

19:57.763 --> 19:59.154
Ha ha ha!

19:59.164 --> 20:01.374
Wow, you've changed a lot.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.925
Yeah. Thank you.

20:03.969 --> 20:06.228
You're welcome. A--And they're
giving you the Corn Cob Key.

20:06.238 --> 20:08.530
- I mean, that's amazing.
- Nah, it's nothing.

20:08.540 --> 20:11.633
Don't be modest.
I--I--I love your book.

20:11.643 --> 20:14.436
I mean, you totally deserve
the award.

20:14.446 --> 20:16.271
- Wh--Really?
- Yeah.

20:16.281 --> 20:18.281
- Wow, thank you.
- Mm.

20:18.317 --> 20:22.044
Say, listen, what are you doing
tonight? Do you want to, uh--um...

20:22.054 --> 20:24.046
uh, a drink or go out for dinner
or something?

20:24.056 --> 20:26.854
I'd...Iove to but I--I can't.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.817
I've got cheerleading practice.

20:28.827 --> 20:30.852
- That's awesome.
- No!

20:30.896 --> 20:32.321
I'm the coach now.

20:32.331 --> 20:33.956
- Oh, oh.
- Yeah.

20:33.966 --> 20:36.400
Um, h--here's my number.

20:39.271 --> 20:40.929
Call me.

20:40.939 --> 20:43.237
- I will.
- OK. Bye.

20:43.275 --> 20:45.275
Bye.

20:48.313 --> 20:51.203
God, I'm so glad
I wrote that book!

20:57.256 --> 20:58.614
According to my syllabus...

20:58.624 --> 21:00.749
we should be
well into wrestling by now.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.851
But because of
your lack of focus...

21:02.861 --> 21:06.822
we've yet to get past
the fundamentals of kickball.

21:06.832 --> 21:08.790
Kreamer, first rule of Bunting.

21:08.800 --> 21:10.825
Um, do--don't--

21:10.869 --> 21:13.161
There is no Bunting
in kickball, Kreamer.

21:13.171 --> 21:15.639
Set of ten.

21:15.674 --> 21:19.001
Henderson, is there a reason
why your shoe is untied?

21:19.011 --> 21:21.303
- Um--
- You see on the kickball field...

21:21.313 --> 21:23.305
a screw-up like that
can put you in a wheelchair.

21:23.315 --> 21:24.906
You'll end up
writing your name...

21:24.916 --> 21:26.308
with a pencil taped
to your head...

21:26.318 --> 21:29.123
the rest of your life.
Set of ten.

21:30.422 --> 21:33.382
Until you learn
the basics of any sport...

21:33.392 --> 21:35.317
you cannot participate in it...

21:35.327 --> 21:37.522
let alone excel in it.

21:37.562 --> 21:39.688
What are you doing in my class?

21:39.698 --> 21:41.290
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.225
Well, you did. Set of ten.

21:43.235 --> 21:45.669
- What?
- It was a joke.

21:45.704 --> 21:50.039
- What do you want?
- Maybe I should just come back.

21:52.678 --> 21:54.269
Maybe you should spit it out now...

21:54.279 --> 21:55.837
so I don't have to
explain to their parents...

21:55.847 --> 21:58.106
why they didn't graduate on time.

21:58.116 --> 22:00.042
Well, I've just been feeling...

22:00.052 --> 22:02.711
like there's been
some tension between us.

22:02.721 --> 22:05.213
Like at dinner,
with the check, and uh...

22:05.223 --> 22:07.015
I guess I just
wanted to say...

22:07.025 --> 22:10.595
that some of that
might have been my fault.

22:11.763 --> 22:13.689
I'm sorry,
he seems to be in pain.

22:13.699 --> 22:14.923
- Who?
- Him!

22:14.933 --> 22:18.164
He's fine. Kreamer,
off your knees.

22:18.203 --> 22:19.361
Well, he doesn't look fine.

22:19.371 --> 22:20.896
Listen, I have
a class to teach...

22:20.906 --> 22:23.498
so why don't you get to
your point, if you've got one?

22:23.508 --> 22:27.569
I guess I just wanted
to say I'm sorry.

22:31.550 --> 22:36.613
And I'm sure for your part
you're a little sorry too.

22:36.655 --> 22:39.556
- I don't do sorry.
- What?

22:39.591 --> 22:42.617
Sorry is for criminals and
screw-ups and I'm neither one.

22:42.627 --> 22:44.486
Get up, Henderson.

22:44.496 --> 22:46.589
Not you, Kreamer.

22:46.631 --> 22:48.756
Now, if you don't mind...

22:48.767 --> 22:52.337
these children
are in need of an education.

22:52.537 --> 22:54.329
Schwartz, you better
fight your way...

22:54.339 --> 22:55.831
past that stutter of yours...

22:55.841 --> 23:00.535
and tell me about the pop fly
rule as it pertains to kickball.

23:00.545 --> 23:02.775
W--Well, it--it--

23:02.814 --> 23:04.814
It--

23:05.450 --> 23:08.076
- When--
- S--s--s--s--s--s--s--set of ten.

23:08.086 --> 23:12.781
Fine. My mom wants to date that
asshole, she can go right ahead.

23:12.791 --> 23:16.051
Chapter 12. Never interfere
in other people's lives.

23:16.061 --> 23:19.254
I don't think
Mr. Woodcock's right for you.

23:19.264 --> 23:21.562
- Really?
- Yeah.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.659
He's, um...

23:25.270 --> 23:28.196
well, the truth is, he's not
a very nice person, Mom.

23:28.206 --> 23:29.831
- He isn't?
- Do you remember when I used to...

23:29.841 --> 23:31.900
come home crying
every day after school?

23:31.910 --> 23:33.435
You were so sensitive.

23:33.445 --> 23:35.303
That's why you're
so good at what you do.

23:35.313 --> 23:36.972
It's not about being sensitive, Mom.

23:36.982 --> 23:38.573
He made all of us miserable.

23:38.583 --> 23:41.410
Sweetheart, you just
hated anything athletic.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.378
You can't blame Jasper for that.

23:43.388 --> 23:45.213
You don't know him like I do.

23:45.223 --> 23:48.028
And you don't know him like I do.

23:48.960 --> 23:52.361
- He touched me.
- What?

23:52.898 --> 23:54.923
OK, that's not true.

23:54.966 --> 23:56.925
But he's mean, and he's cruel.

23:56.935 --> 23:58.994
Mom, I'm telling you,
he's still--

23:59.004 --> 24:00.762
He's still what?

24:00.772 --> 24:03.104
He's still teaching gym.

24:03.141 --> 24:06.001
- Oh! What'd you bring me?
- Dinner.

24:06.011 --> 24:09.538
Sorry I'm late. Had a long day.
Got a little behind.

24:09.548 --> 24:14.178
Wow. Jasper grills
the best beef in Nebraska.

24:14.219 --> 24:16.681
Well, I am known for my meat.

24:16.691 --> 24:18.480
You only got 2 though,
sweetie.

24:18.490 --> 24:22.485
I'm sorry. I guess it
must have slipped my mind.

24:24.062 --> 24:26.621
John, you don't mind
running to the store, do you?

24:26.631 --> 24:28.631
No.

24:29.234 --> 24:31.234
Take your time.

24:35.707 --> 24:38.175
"I'm known for my meat!"

24:38.210 --> 24:40.508
"I'm known for my meat."

24:40.545 --> 24:43.371
Actually, you're not known
for your meat, Woodcock.

24:43.381 --> 24:45.106
You're known for emotionally crippling...

24:45.116 --> 24:47.921
an entire generation of children.

24:50.555 --> 24:52.555
Dickhead!

25:04.102 --> 25:06.229
Mom.

25:06.271 --> 25:07.696
Sweetheart.

25:07.706 --> 25:09.564
What's wrong?

25:09.574 --> 25:12.543
Jasper and I are no longer dating.

25:13.078 --> 25:15.078
Oh.

25:15.113 --> 25:17.980
That's so sad.

25:18.016 --> 25:20.246
What happened?

25:21.786 --> 25:23.786
We're engaged.

25:24.122 --> 25:26.122
Oh.

25:30.195 --> 25:32.454
Have we heard
a congratulations yet?

25:32.464 --> 25:35.900
Oh, I think he's in shock.

25:35.934 --> 25:37.859
That's so good.

25:37.869 --> 25:39.327
Oh, I'll get it.

25:39.337 --> 25:42.142
I wanna start spreading the news.

25:43.708 --> 25:45.708
Mm.

25:47.078 --> 25:49.078
Ha ha ha.

25:49.748 --> 25:51.748
Hello?

25:53.552 --> 25:57.377
Well, it looks like
I'm gonna be your new dad.

25:58.523 --> 26:01.316
Come on, Johnny.
Stay, help us celebrate.

26:01.326 --> 26:03.218
Sorry, Mom.
Book tour emergency.

26:03.228 --> 26:04.920
I have to get to the airport.

26:04.930 --> 26:07.489
- You haven't eaten.
- I--I'll grab something on the way.

26:07.499 --> 26:09.024
I love you, Mom.
It's great to see you.

26:09.034 --> 26:10.559
I love you too.

26:10.569 --> 26:12.569
Farley.

26:16.107 --> 26:18.107
Be safe.

26:26.851 --> 26:29.376
Eenie, meanie, miney...

26:30.155 --> 26:32.155
Farley.

26:33.425 --> 26:36.885
There's no truer test
of the human spirit...

26:36.895 --> 26:38.895
than wrestling.

26:42.734 --> 26:45.396
That's called a takedown.

26:45.437 --> 26:46.995
Get up, Farley.

26:47.005 --> 26:48.897
There are many kinds
of takedowns.

26:48.907 --> 26:51.800
Today, we're going to
cover some of my favorites.

26:51.810 --> 26:54.530
This is called the head and arm.

26:55.647 --> 26:57.639
This is called
the single leg sweep.

26:57.649 --> 26:59.649
You step and you sweep!

27:00.819 --> 27:02.210
This is called
the fireman's throw.

27:02.220 --> 27:06.385
Shoot the crotch,
collapse the hip and sling shot.

27:08.093 --> 27:09.684
OK, Farley, you're up.

27:09.694 --> 27:11.353
What?

27:11.363 --> 27:13.695
Put me on the mat.

27:13.732 --> 27:15.423
Come on. You were paying
attention, weren't you?

27:15.433 --> 27:17.433
Let's go.

27:19.604 --> 27:21.604
OK, take me down.

27:24.275 --> 27:27.736
You see there is no reason why
even a little porker like this...

27:27.746 --> 27:29.404
shouldn't be able to take me
straight to the mat.

27:29.414 --> 27:31.806
I once saw a 4-foot Laotian...

27:31.816 --> 27:33.908
twist a 250lb Swede so hard...

27:33.918 --> 27:35.543
that he mopped
the bleachers with his blood.

27:35.553 --> 27:37.379
The only reason I'm still standing...

27:37.389 --> 27:39.881
is because you don't believe
in yourself, Farley!

27:39.891 --> 27:42.441
You don't believe in yourself!

27:42.727 --> 27:44.854
Stop the cab! Stop!

27:44.896 --> 27:47.763
Don't believe in myself, my ass!

27:47.799 --> 27:49.691
I invented believing in yourself.

27:49.701 --> 27:51.993
No way in hell this guy's gonna
run me out of my own house.

27:52.003 --> 27:55.397
Wow. Woodcock's still
plowing your mom, huh?

27:55.407 --> 27:57.365
He's marrying her.

27:57.375 --> 28:00.068
Wait, Woodcock's marrying your mom?

28:00.078 --> 28:01.670
Ha ha ha. Dudes!

28:01.680 --> 28:04.148
Don't even think about it!

28:04.182 --> 28:05.740
Get me a pitcher!

28:05.750 --> 28:09.686
What is that, Canadian bacon?

28:09.721 --> 28:12.180
So I guess the talk didn't go very well?

28:12.190 --> 28:15.116
God, can you imagine my family
with Woodcock in it?

28:15.126 --> 28:18.053
A tie for Christmas, Farley?
Set of ten!

28:18.063 --> 28:20.255
You didn't eat your vegetables?
Take a lap.

28:20.265 --> 28:23.224
You call that a grandchild?
Rhetorical question, Farley.

28:23.234 --> 28:25.393
That sucks.
What are you gonna do?

28:25.403 --> 28:27.362
I'm gonna kill Woodcock.

28:27.372 --> 28:28.830
- And you're gonna help me.
- John.

28:28.840 --> 28:31.066
I've already got 2 strikes
and I can't be a part of--

28:31.076 --> 28:33.301
I'm just venting here. Is that
OK? Is it OK if a guy vents?

28:33.311 --> 28:35.637
Yeah, sure, because I thought
you were serious.

28:35.647 --> 28:37.572
Ha! I've got it.
I'm gonna break them up.

28:37.582 --> 28:39.407
How are you gonna do that?

28:39.417 --> 28:42.477
You see, I made a mistake before.

28:42.520 --> 28:44.646
I let him take me out of my game.

28:44.656 --> 28:47.682
But this time,
I'm gonna get inside his head...

28:47.692 --> 28:49.417
and spin him like a top.

28:49.427 --> 28:54.089
That's good. I don't remember
anything like that in your book.

28:54.099 --> 28:56.734
It's not in my book, Nedderman.

28:58.002 --> 28:59.928
- Hello.
- Hey, John.

28:59.938 --> 29:02.097
- How's my favorite author?
- Hey, Maggie.

29:02.107 --> 29:03.798
Hold on a second.

29:03.808 --> 29:06.299
OK, Mommy time's over.

29:06.344 --> 29:07.368
But don't be sad.

29:07.378 --> 29:09.370
Yeah, uh, actually, I gotta
talk to you about that.

29:09.380 --> 29:12.373
I know you have some kind of
corn chowder thing on Sunday...

29:12.383 --> 29:14.909
but look, I have amazing news.
Oprah...

29:14.919 --> 29:17.378
is seriously considering
your book for the book club.

29:17.388 --> 29:19.681
It's unbelievable. I have you
on a 9:30 flight out...

29:19.691 --> 29:21.649
and then I'll meet you on the
connecting flight in St. Louis.

29:21.659 --> 29:23.084
Maggie, I can't.

29:23.094 --> 29:25.587
- It's a long story but I--I can't.
- Knock it off!

29:25.597 --> 29:28.289
- You can't what?
- I can't make it to Chicago.

29:28.299 --> 29:30.925
My mom needs me. She's about
to marry the Antichrist.

29:30.935 --> 29:34.162
Look, I don't care
if your granny's on fire.

29:34.172 --> 29:35.497
This is Oprah.

29:35.507 --> 29:36.965
She farts on a book...

29:36.975 --> 29:38.933
and it magically
sells a million copies.

29:38.943 --> 29:40.769
Just get your ass on that plane!

29:40.779 --> 29:43.471
- Maggie, please, listen...
- Breaking up this phone call.

29:43.481 --> 29:47.713
Get on...plane tomorrow.

29:47.752 --> 29:50.050
Hey! Where are you going?

29:50.088 --> 29:53.318
W--Wait! Tell me more about your wife!

29:57.595 --> 29:59.595
Mom?

30:02.233 --> 30:05.560
See, I made a mistake before.
I let him take me off my game.

30:05.570 --> 30:08.329
But this time I'm gonna get
inside his head...

30:08.339 --> 30:10.379
and spin him like a top.

30:10.608 --> 30:12.367
Spin him like a top.

30:12.377 --> 30:14.235
- Spin him like...
- Tickle machine!

30:14.245 --> 30:16.704
No, no, no!
Not a tickle machine. No!

30:16.714 --> 30:19.342
Oh, oh, stop it!

30:19.384 --> 30:22.217
Oh, Jasper, mind--

30:24.689 --> 30:26.915
Who was that?
I think someone's in the house.

30:26.925 --> 30:30.070
- Don't worry, I got it.
- Be careful.

30:32.030 --> 30:34.055
Oh, shit!

30:35.033 --> 30:38.264
No, no! Oh! Ow! Ow!

30:38.303 --> 30:40.728
Ow, it's me! It's me! It's John!

30:40.738 --> 30:43.468
Stop! Ow! Stop! It's John, man!

30:43.508 --> 30:46.234
- Oh! Johnny!
- What the hell, Woodcock?

30:46.244 --> 30:48.503
Well, it was dark.
Instinct took over.

30:48.513 --> 30:50.271
What about when I said,
"It's me! It's John!"

30:50.281 --> 30:52.907
John's a very common name.
There could be a burglar named John.

30:52.917 --> 30:55.076
What burglar shouts out
his own name?

30:55.086 --> 30:58.346
I'm sure it was an accident,
sweetie. I--um--

30:58.356 --> 31:00.114
Honey, I thought you were in danger.

31:00.124 --> 31:01.983
Oh.

31:01.993 --> 31:04.359
Are you all right?

31:04.395 --> 31:06.221
Yeah, I'm fine.

31:06.231 --> 31:08.223
Well, uh, J--John,
what are you doing here?

31:08.233 --> 31:09.524
I thought about it...

31:09.534 --> 31:11.092
and I just didn't want
to disappoint you, Mom.

31:11.102 --> 31:14.697
Aw, that is so sweet.

31:14.739 --> 31:17.632
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Yeah, I'm great.

31:17.642 --> 31:20.076
All right, well, then, um...

31:20.111 --> 31:23.304
- we'll see you in the morning.
- Great.

31:23.314 --> 31:25.314
Come on, Jasper.

31:26.150 --> 31:28.150
Farley.

32:12.330 --> 32:15.390
So you really didn't know
it was me last night?

32:15.400 --> 32:16.724
Well, that's what happens...

32:16.734 --> 32:18.793
when you go sneaking around
someone else's house.

32:18.803 --> 32:20.295
What do you mean,
someone else's house?

32:20.305 --> 32:21.829
Well, last time I checked, chief...

32:21.839 --> 32:23.164
you don't live here anymore.

32:23.174 --> 32:25.174
That's not the point.

32:48.599 --> 32:51.793
- Morning. Oh, no, sweetheart. Oh, my God.
- Sorry.

32:51.803 --> 32:54.329
That is so rude. Don't do that.

32:54.339 --> 32:55.763
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

32:55.773 --> 32:57.732
- I love you.
- Oh, thank you.

32:57.742 --> 32:59.742
Oh, I love you too.

32:59.777 --> 33:02.136
- I love you so much.
- Aww. Thank you.

33:02.146 --> 33:04.146
He's the best.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.841
Well, if it isn't
the future Mrs. Woodcock.

33:06.851 --> 33:08.810
Aww.

33:08.820 --> 33:12.654
Mmmmm. Mmmmmm.

33:13.324 --> 33:14.716
Mmmm! Ha ha!

33:14.726 --> 33:17.685
Hey, Jasper. How about we spend
the day together?

33:17.695 --> 33:19.387
Get to know each other better,
you know?

33:19.397 --> 33:22.798
- What a great idea.
- Yeah.

33:24.402 --> 33:26.828
Actually, I have a lot
on my plate today, John.

33:26.838 --> 33:29.500
Oh, come on. We'll have fun.

33:29.540 --> 33:32.338
- Mmm!
- I'll take a rain check.

33:32.377 --> 33:34.377
Honey.

33:35.580 --> 33:37.338
I'm glad we're doing this.

33:37.348 --> 33:38.840
Getting to know each other better...

33:38.850 --> 33:40.508
talking things out.

33:40.518 --> 33:43.918
Conversation leads
to inspiration, right?

33:44.856 --> 33:46.814
That's from my book.

33:46.824 --> 33:49.349
Ah, I'll get you a copy.

33:49.394 --> 33:53.694
Look, I love my mom.
We're very, very close.

33:53.731 --> 33:55.757
Not in a weird way, of course.
Just close.

33:55.767 --> 33:57.191
Listen, we could be pals.

33:57.201 --> 33:59.560
We could be guys
that sit and watch foot--

33:59.570 --> 34:02.830
...hanging loose at the gym.
To me, this is what life is about.

34:02.840 --> 34:05.466
Now, I'm not saying there's
a problem here. I don't judge.

34:05.476 --> 34:07.568
You guys have only known
each other 5 months.

34:07.578 --> 34:10.338
You've got your whole life
ahead of you. You could be kids.

34:10.348 --> 34:12.540
I don't know what you guys
like to do...

34:12.550 --> 34:14.609
but it's just
that's--that's what's important.

34:14.619 --> 34:17.145
I'm just trying to tell you,
don't rush, OK?

34:17.155 --> 34:19.282
Don't rush your life.

34:19.322 --> 34:21.322
You know?

34:22.560 --> 34:24.685
Running your mouth
doesn't count as exercise.

34:24.695 --> 34:26.989
You gonna work out or what?

35:14.846 --> 35:17.007
I think you'll survive.

35:17.048 --> 35:18.873
You're not showering?

35:18.883 --> 35:21.147
No, no. I'm good.

35:21.185 --> 35:22.743
This is not France, Farley.

35:22.753 --> 35:24.378
Maybe you don't mind smelling
like a nut sack all day...

35:24.388 --> 35:26.547
but I gotta be in the car with you.

35:26.557 --> 35:30.637
There are kids in Africa
who'd kill for a shower.

35:31.028 --> 35:33.153
Come on, Farley. Move it.

35:34.198 --> 35:35.723
You called me Farley.

35:35.733 --> 35:38.192
You used to call me that
when I was in your class.

35:38.202 --> 35:40.397
It's your name, isn't it?

35:40.438 --> 35:42.330
You really don't remember me?

35:42.340 --> 35:44.065
Well, with your innate athletic ability...

35:44.075 --> 35:45.299
it's hard to believe, huh?

35:45.309 --> 35:47.168
Do you remember what--

35:47.178 --> 35:49.103
Simply rub the solution on your teeth...

35:49.113 --> 35:52.003
wait a few moments and then rinse.

35:52.750 --> 35:55.977
- Morning, boys.
- Jasper, you old side-winder.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.512
Come to get your ears lowered?

35:57.522 --> 35:59.313
Hey, you look like you could stand...

35:59.323 --> 36:01.849
to have a little taken
off the top, you damn hippy.

36:01.859 --> 36:03.251
Well, looks like you could stand...

36:03.261 --> 36:05.920
to have a little taken off the
middle, you fat son of a bitch.

36:05.930 --> 36:07.855
Ha ha ha!

36:07.865 --> 36:10.857
Hee hee hee.

36:10.902 --> 36:13.200
You got an appointment?

36:13.237 --> 36:15.630
- No, sir. I'm with him.
- Sit down, Farley.

36:15.640 --> 36:17.732
God knows
you could use a little trim.

36:17.742 --> 36:19.033
- Ha ha ha!
- I don't know, Jasper.

36:19.043 --> 36:21.636
You think that boy
even knows what trim is?

36:21.646 --> 36:23.646
Ha ha ha!

36:23.681 --> 36:25.506
Sit down, Huckleberry.

36:25.516 --> 36:28.876
- Maybe clean up the back a little bit.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:28.886 --> 36:32.480
So, Jasper.
How's that hell cat of yours doing?

36:32.490 --> 36:35.183
- Yeah, she's keeping me young.
- Yes, she is.

36:35.193 --> 36:37.189
- In the sack.
- Ha!

36:37.199 --> 36:40.555
Yeah, well, I'm gonna make
an honest woman out of her.

36:40.565 --> 36:42.423
Thought you woulda learned
the first time.

36:42.433 --> 36:44.924
Yeah, guess not.

36:44.969 --> 36:46.694
You never told me
you were married before.

36:46.704 --> 36:51.599
Yeah, well, I never told you about
my kidney stones either. So what?

36:51.609 --> 36:53.873
Whoa! What are you doing?

36:53.911 --> 36:56.871
Well, don't have a hissy fit, Nancy!

36:56.881 --> 36:59.346
It's just a pair of clippers.

37:03.754 --> 37:06.080
You knew they were gonna do that.

37:06.090 --> 37:08.115
If you didn't want a haircut
you didn't have to get one.

37:08.125 --> 37:10.125
This is not Russia.

37:18.769 --> 37:22.029
- You're late, you fairy!
- How you doing, Dad?

37:22.039 --> 37:25.099
All I do all day is watch Judge
Joe Brown and piss myself.

37:25.109 --> 37:26.834
How the hell
do you think I'm doing?

37:26.844 --> 37:29.039
Wait, you have a father?

37:29.080 --> 37:30.738
Yes, Farley, I'm not Jesus.

37:30.748 --> 37:34.475
- Who is this genius?
- It's, uh, Beverly's kid.

37:34.485 --> 37:35.843
Looks like he got a little retard in him.

37:35.853 --> 37:37.078
Are you simple, boy?

37:37.088 --> 37:38.913
- Ha ha ha.
- So, Dad...

37:38.923 --> 37:41.721
- I'm getting married.
- Again?

37:41.759 --> 37:42.817
So--Yes.

37:42.827 --> 37:44.785
Didn't you screw that up enough
the first time?

37:44.795 --> 37:48.456
I'll give it 6 months. Oh, I'll
outlive this marriage. And you!

37:48.466 --> 37:52.360
How down on her luck must your
momma be to marry a gym teacher?

37:52.370 --> 37:56.030
She knows that he plays
hopscotch for a living, right?

37:56.040 --> 37:58.165
- You think I'm funny, boy?
- No.

37:58.175 --> 38:00.134
- You want to wrestle me?
- Uh, no, thank you.

38:00.144 --> 38:01.869
Come on, wrestle an old man!

38:01.879 --> 38:03.337
- Dad--
- Come on, cream puff!

38:03.347 --> 38:06.607
My legs are as useless
as your little pecker, but come on!

38:06.617 --> 38:08.617
- Dad, Dad--
- Come on!

38:08.653 --> 38:11.345
I'm going to teach my class now.
Do you want to go to the pool?

38:11.355 --> 38:15.018
Water sports is
for girls and sodomites!

38:15.059 --> 38:16.083
Sodomites.

38:16.093 --> 38:18.052
OK, I'll see you later, Dad.

38:18.062 --> 38:20.788
- Well, it was a pleasure.
- Beat it, fruitcake!

38:20.798 --> 38:23.518
He seems like a really nice guy.

38:23.534 --> 38:25.926
You want a shoe up your ass, Farley?

38:25.936 --> 38:27.936
No.

38:28.673 --> 38:30.968
Robinson, go dump a bedpan.

38:34.312 --> 38:36.312
OK, let's move it.

38:41.619 --> 38:43.619
Get those arms up!

38:44.522 --> 38:46.854
Where's Palumbo?

38:46.891 --> 38:49.650
Palumbo, are you crippled and deaf?

38:49.660 --> 38:51.660
Into the pool!

38:52.997 --> 38:54.689
Palumbo, don't push me.

38:54.699 --> 38:58.100
I think his hearing aid
is on the fritz.

38:58.135 --> 38:59.994
I didn't ask you, did I, Weaver?

39:00.004 --> 39:01.195
Well, no, I guess not.

39:01.205 --> 39:03.497
Rhetorical question, Weaver.
Take a lap.

39:03.507 --> 39:06.000
Oh. I was just trying to help!

39:06.010 --> 39:07.935
Don't you think you're being
a little harsh with them?

39:07.945 --> 39:10.037
They're just old, Farley.
They're not pathetic.

39:10.047 --> 39:12.047
They enjoy a challenge.

39:14.018 --> 39:16.043
Move those legs.

39:17.555 --> 39:19.847
I'm not gonna ask you again, Palumbo.

39:19.857 --> 39:21.716
Lose the attitude.

39:21.726 --> 39:24.126
Oh, you think this is funny?

39:24.161 --> 39:26.253
All right, that's it, Palumbo.
It's go time.

39:26.263 --> 39:27.288
What the--

39:27.298 --> 39:28.756
And Platts, don't think
I'm not watching you.

39:28.766 --> 39:31.559
You're not the first person
in the world to get a hip replacement.

39:31.569 --> 39:33.867
Pick up the pace!

39:33.904 --> 39:37.049
OK, Palumbo,
this is your last chance.

39:38.576 --> 39:40.468
Oh, really? OK,
we'll do it your way, then.

39:40.478 --> 39:42.636
- Whoa, whoa--
- Sink or swim, old man.

39:42.646 --> 39:46.273
- Whoa, whoa, whoa! No, no, no!
- Sink or swim!

39:46.283 --> 39:47.708
Jesus, are you insane?

39:47.718 --> 39:49.243
He doesn't need your help, Farley.

39:49.253 --> 39:51.293
What the hell, man? Aah!

39:57.161 --> 39:59.186
Sir, it's all right.
I'm trying to help you.

39:59.196 --> 40:02.188
I'm trying to save your life!

40:02.233 --> 40:04.233
Oh!

40:19.116 --> 40:21.116
Hm.

40:28.526 --> 40:30.526
Jackass!

40:32.263 --> 40:34.855
Nice job, Scardusio.
Did you get any tongue?

40:34.865 --> 40:37.491
No, but I get better suction
without the choppers.

40:37.501 --> 40:39.501
Makes sense.

40:39.937 --> 40:41.937
Oh!

40:46.610 --> 40:48.669
Come on, Farley, let's saddle up.

40:48.679 --> 40:51.569
I'm waiting for my clothes to dry.

40:53.284 --> 40:54.642
- Hello?
- Hey, John.

40:54.652 --> 40:56.977
I'm on an airplane heading for Chicago.

40:56.987 --> 40:58.846
And you'll never guess
who's sitting next to me.

40:58.856 --> 41:00.681
- Who?
- Nobody!

41:00.691 --> 41:04.218
Now where is your ass
and why isn't it in seat 2A?

41:04.228 --> 41:06.120
Man, just hold on a second.
I got another call.

41:06.130 --> 41:07.888
- Hello?
- I got your message, dude.

41:07.898 --> 41:11.061
- What's going on?
- Hey. Hold on.

41:11.101 --> 41:14.061
You know, Mr. Woodcock,
I'm just gonna get myself home.

41:14.071 --> 41:17.031
Suit yourself, Farley.
Just get some pants on.

41:17.041 --> 41:19.041
This is not Miami.

41:19.710 --> 41:21.750
Suddenly it makes sense.

41:24.148 --> 41:26.740
Nedderman, Woodcock's
been married before.

41:26.750 --> 41:28.542
Now, I need you to find out
who she is...

41:28.552 --> 41:29.743
and then pick me up at Alterman's.

41:29.753 --> 41:31.983
Right. The nursing home?

41:32.022 --> 41:33.781
Yeah, and bring me some underwear.

41:33.791 --> 41:35.583
Some of mine?

41:35.593 --> 41:37.551
- Listen, Maggie.
- Hello?

41:37.561 --> 41:39.186
Everything's going to shit
right now, OK?

41:39.196 --> 41:40.221
I'm sorry. I'll call you tomorrow.

41:40.231 --> 41:42.056
No, John, don't hang--

41:42.066 --> 41:44.066
Asshole!

41:45.402 --> 41:48.696
Excuse me. Hi.
Could I get a real bottle, please?

41:48.706 --> 41:51.766
I'm an alcoholic, not a Barbie doll.

41:53.344 --> 41:55.202
What happened to your head?

41:55.212 --> 41:57.305
Just drive, Nedderman.

42:00.150 --> 42:01.942
Her name is Sally Jensen.

42:01.952 --> 42:04.211
Oh, good work!
Let's go see her right now.

42:04.221 --> 42:05.713
Why?

42:05.723 --> 42:08.115
Well, think about it, Nedderman.

42:08.125 --> 42:10.751
Who's more likely to have dirt
on Woodcock than his ex-wife?

42:10.761 --> 42:13.287
But in your book don't you say...

42:13.297 --> 42:15.523
digging up the past
muddies up the present?

42:15.533 --> 42:17.458
Yes, I do...

42:17.468 --> 42:18.993
but that's only true if the past...

42:19.003 --> 42:20.628
doesn't actually affect the present.

42:20.638 --> 42:22.530
Think about it, Nedderman.

42:22.540 --> 42:24.665
If I can learn something
about Woodcock's past...

42:24.675 --> 42:28.135
that'll save my mom from future
heartache in the future...

42:28.145 --> 42:29.637
then I don't really have a choice...

42:29.647 --> 42:31.405
but to address it
in the present, right?

42:31.415 --> 42:33.415
I--Guess not.

42:33.450 --> 42:35.450
Exactly.

42:38.789 --> 42:40.581
Who is that?

42:40.591 --> 42:42.716
That's my brother, Clark.

42:48.032 --> 42:50.330
There it is.

42:50.367 --> 42:53.172
Home of the former Mrs. Woodcock.

42:53.404 --> 42:54.762
All right. I'm going in.

42:54.772 --> 42:57.865
Nedderman, I need you
to find more dirt on Woodcock, all right?

42:57.875 --> 43:01.902
Think outside the box.
See the challenge, focus on it...

43:01.912 --> 43:04.672
visualize, attack it
and then reuse it, OK?

43:04.682 --> 43:07.274
- You got me?
- I--I won't let you down, John. I promise.

43:07.284 --> 43:11.534
- Thanks for the underwear.
- Sorry if they're big.

43:14.792 --> 43:16.951
Hey, see if she has a pool!

43:16.961 --> 43:20.021
Or a koi pond!

43:20.064 --> 43:21.722
A fish tank?

43:21.732 --> 43:23.732
Nedderman.

43:26.503 --> 43:28.503
Sally Jensen?

43:29.573 --> 43:31.231
Who are you?

43:31.241 --> 43:33.971
Um, I'm John Farley.

43:35.112 --> 43:36.837
Can I get you something to drink?

43:36.847 --> 43:39.773
I think I have a clean glass
around here somewhere.

43:39.783 --> 43:41.783
No, I'm good, thanks.

43:47.024 --> 43:49.049
I love your book.

43:49.093 --> 43:51.584
Turned my life around.

43:53.230 --> 43:55.562
Must be my lucky day.

43:55.599 --> 44:00.027
Hometown hero in the flesh
right here in my own living room.

44:00.037 --> 44:02.033
What do you want?

44:02.043 --> 44:05.600
I'm doing research...
for my next book.

44:05.643 --> 44:08.369
If you don't mind my asking,
why did you divorce?

44:08.379 --> 44:10.170
Why do you think?

44:10.180 --> 44:11.672
Infidelity.

44:11.682 --> 44:14.913
Over and over again.

44:14.952 --> 44:17.745
Should have broke it off
years earlier, but--

44:17.755 --> 44:19.079
But what?

44:19.089 --> 44:23.788
- The sex was amazing.
- Oh.

44:23.827 --> 44:25.853
I'm telling you,
that man knows how to use...

44:25.863 --> 44:27.521
what the good Lord gave him.

44:27.531 --> 44:29.590
Oh, right. Thanks for that.

44:29.600 --> 44:33.195
Once, I actually blacked out.

44:33.237 --> 44:38.072
Can you imagine blacking out
from sheer pleasure?

44:38.108 --> 44:42.803
Once I spoke Portuguese
and I don't even know the language.

44:42.813 --> 44:45.539
- OK, I think that's enough.
- Ha ha ha.

44:45.549 --> 44:47.675
Um, this has been very helpful...

44:47.685 --> 44:49.376
and disturbing all at the same time.

44:49.386 --> 44:52.913
Why? Do you know Jasper?

44:52.956 --> 44:56.383
Actually I do. Uh, he was
a teacher of mine, years ago.

44:56.393 --> 44:58.987
And, uh, he's marrying my mom.

44:59.029 --> 45:02.322
Saw him last week
at the coffee shop with her.

45:02.332 --> 45:04.732
A big-titted, blonde tramp.

45:04.768 --> 45:07.828
Sorry. No offense.

45:07.871 --> 45:11.031
She looks awfully young
to be your mom.

45:11.041 --> 45:13.233
- He's cheating on her.
- What?

45:13.243 --> 45:15.969
Yup. He cheated on his ex-wife.
That's why they got divorced.

45:15.979 --> 45:17.037
Now he's doing the same thing
to my mom...

45:17.047 --> 45:20.107
with some big-titted, blonde tramp.

45:20.150 --> 45:23.343
So that's great. So--So we just
gotta tell your mom now.

45:23.353 --> 45:24.845
No, I can't just tell her.

45:24.855 --> 45:26.246
She doesn't listen to me
when it comes to Woodcock.

45:26.256 --> 45:28.048
- We need proof.
- No problem.

45:28.058 --> 45:29.950
We've been working on
some killer stuff on our end.

45:29.960 --> 45:33.785
Good. Meet me at my place
as soon as possible.

45:36.934 --> 45:39.159
You wanted evidence, you got it.

45:39.169 --> 45:40.728
It may not prove Woodcock's cheating...

45:40.738 --> 45:42.596
but it does prove he's a huge dick.

45:42.606 --> 45:44.565
What happened to his eye?

45:44.575 --> 45:47.401
Look, don't worry about him.
He's fine.

45:47.411 --> 45:51.661
When she sees this, man,
she'll come to her senses.

45:51.682 --> 45:55.142
No, Mr. Woodcock.
Please don't hurt me again.

45:55.152 --> 45:57.152
Aah!

45:58.188 --> 46:00.247
Ha ha ha. Well?

46:00.290 --> 46:02.850
You threw a chair at your brother?

46:02.860 --> 46:04.953
Weren't you watching?

46:04.995 --> 46:06.887
It wasn't me that threw
the chair at him...

46:06.897 --> 46:08.756
it was Woodcock
that threw the chair.

46:08.766 --> 46:10.624
He said Woodcock.
Woodcock threw that chair!

46:10.634 --> 46:13.000
Honey? Hi, are you home?

46:13.036 --> 46:16.997
Oh, look, that's so nice.
You've got some friends over.

46:17.007 --> 46:19.007
Hi, I'm John's mom.

46:21.411 --> 46:23.411
Nedderman.

46:23.447 --> 46:25.847
Nedderman.

46:25.883 --> 46:28.709
You remember him?
We were in the same class.

46:28.719 --> 46:31.153
What happened to your head?

46:31.188 --> 46:32.913
Woodcock doesn't deserve her.

46:32.923 --> 46:35.215
Farley's mom is hot.
I mean, yes, she's old and shit...

46:35.225 --> 46:37.184
but God, I just want
to stick my face...

46:37.194 --> 46:40.420
between those great old titties
and go, "Brrrrrrr!

46:40.430 --> 46:44.161
"Brrrrr!
Brrrrrrrr! Brrrrrrrrr!"

46:44.201 --> 46:45.959
Nedderman, turn it off.

46:45.969 --> 46:48.733
...titties and go, "Brrrrrrr!"

46:49.673 --> 46:50.964
Big old--big old titties--

46:50.974 --> 46:52.432
Big old titties--

46:52.442 --> 46:54.001
- Jasper.
- Brrrrrrrrr!

46:54.011 --> 46:56.011
Jasper!

46:56.980 --> 47:01.060
I meant that in the most
respectful way possible.

47:03.520 --> 47:05.520
Run!

47:05.923 --> 47:07.648
Mrs. Farley!

47:07.658 --> 47:09.550
You people are sick, Farley.

47:09.560 --> 47:12.419
- I barely know those guys, Mom.
- OK--

47:12.429 --> 47:17.890
Well--Let's just pretend
that never happened.

47:20.304 --> 47:22.898
Johnny, are you all right?

47:22.940 --> 47:27.877
Jasper said that he thought
you seemed upset today.

47:27.911 --> 47:31.677
Oh! He did? Oh.

47:31.715 --> 47:35.642
Sweetie, look, I know
that it's not easy for you...

47:35.652 --> 47:38.011
to have a new man in our house.

47:38.021 --> 47:39.613
But we're getting married...

47:39.623 --> 47:42.768
and he's gonna be part of our family.

47:43.360 --> 47:47.626
All I want is for
just you two to get along.

47:47.664 --> 47:50.394
Is that asking too much?

47:50.434 --> 47:51.959
Could you try?

47:51.969 --> 47:53.969
For me?

47:55.172 --> 47:56.763
OK.

47:56.773 --> 47:59.199
- I love you, Mom.
- Oh, sweetie. I love you too.

47:59.209 --> 48:02.042
- Thank you. Oh!
- Sorry.

48:02.079 --> 48:04.438
Let's go to Cornival.
Let's have a good time tonight.

48:04.448 --> 48:08.018
Great. We'll have a great night.
All of us.

48:23.400 --> 48:27.837
# My loves have some stories... #

48:29.172 --> 48:31.031
- Come on, tell me.
- No, forget it.

48:31.041 --> 48:32.699
No, I want to know!

48:32.709 --> 48:35.335
- Look, I'm embarrassed, OK?
- Oh!

48:35.345 --> 48:37.838
John, you can't just start
saying something and then stop.

48:37.848 --> 48:40.574
- Come on.
- Never mind, never mind.

48:40.584 --> 48:42.745
John.

48:42.786 --> 48:44.981
Oh, all right. Um...

48:45.022 --> 48:49.982
I've had the biggest crush
on you since the 7th grade.

48:50.027 --> 48:54.259
Ha ha ha. And here we are!

48:54.298 --> 48:56.357
Yeah, here we are.

48:56.400 --> 48:58.258
The cornival.

48:58.268 --> 49:01.413
- I'm glad you called.
- Yeah, me too.

49:02.506 --> 49:06.867
- Jasper! Let me do it.
- Lift it up. Keep it up high.

49:06.877 --> 49:08.635
Oh! Now you're cheating!

49:08.645 --> 49:12.806
Aw. You have to admit,
they're kind of cute together.

49:12.816 --> 49:14.541
You're kidding?

49:14.551 --> 49:17.645
No, your mom is beautiful.

49:17.688 --> 49:21.021
And Woodcock's kinda sexy,
you know.

49:21.058 --> 49:23.322
- Mr. Woodcock?
- Yeah.

49:23.360 --> 49:27.354
I mean, just, I don't know,
the way he--he carries himself.

49:27.364 --> 49:29.489
- What?
- There's just something about him.

49:29.499 --> 49:32.292
It's like this bravado
and...I don't know.

49:32.302 --> 49:34.661
All the girls at school love him.
I mean, he's hilarious.

49:34.671 --> 49:36.363
One time he grabbed me by my--

49:36.373 --> 49:37.965
He coxes them
in the teachers' lounge.

49:37.975 --> 49:40.334
He has this little game
that we play with his whistle.

49:40.344 --> 49:44.679
Actually, I've always kinda
had a crush on Woodcock.

49:46.883 --> 49:49.977
Wow! You--you wanna go?

49:50.020 --> 49:51.578
Yeah, sure.

49:51.588 --> 49:56.433
That's cool, right?
You're not--you're not gonna eat that.

49:57.661 --> 49:59.619
Hey, guys. How are you doing?

49:59.629 --> 50:01.995
Oh, good. I'm done.

50:02.032 --> 50:04.958
Um, why don't you two
play a little bit, huh?

50:04.968 --> 50:07.060
- I thought you wanted to win a panda.
- Oh, it's all right.

50:07.070 --> 50:09.162
- I'll win you a panda, Mom.
- Oh!

50:09.172 --> 50:12.032
- Sure you brought enough cash?
- Jasper.

50:12.042 --> 50:15.936
OK, so let's go get some cotton
candy and let the boys play.

50:15.946 --> 50:17.537
- Yeah.
- Good luck.

50:17.547 --> 50:19.947
Win me a puppy.

50:19.983 --> 50:22.342
- OK, Woodcock.
- Looks like we got a challenge.

50:22.352 --> 50:24.511
- Let's play.
- Good luck, young man.

50:24.521 --> 50:27.319
There you go, sir. Here we go!

50:27.357 --> 50:29.316
Ha! Harder than it looks!

50:29.326 --> 50:31.487
Hey, nice shot!

50:32.229 --> 50:34.154
Try again, kid.

50:34.164 --> 50:36.860
We got a shooter, folks!

50:36.900 --> 50:39.334
- Oh!
- Nice one, Farley.

50:39.369 --> 50:41.860
- Damn it!
- Whoo!

50:41.905 --> 50:43.397
That's a winner right there.

50:43.407 --> 50:46.500
Looks like a panda to me, sir.
Nice job.

50:46.510 --> 50:50.420
All right, kid.
Everybody's a winner. Ha ha ha!

50:51.615 --> 50:54.141
I've seen better shooting
at the special Olympics.

50:54.151 --> 50:57.577
- Basketball's not really my game.
- Really?

50:57.587 --> 51:00.137
What is your game?
Whac A Mole?

51:07.731 --> 51:09.623
Stupid game!

51:09.633 --> 51:13.293
I just wanna warn you, Farley.
I'm a card-carrying member of the N.R.A.

51:13.303 --> 51:15.464
You don't have a prayer.

51:15.505 --> 51:17.505
Ready, gentlemen!

51:27.951 --> 51:30.911
- We have a winner!
- Don't be a sore loser.

51:30.921 --> 51:32.746
I'm telling you,
my gun was messed up.

51:32.756 --> 51:34.915
It's never the gun, Farley,
it's always the hunter.

51:34.925 --> 51:37.325
"Corn-eating Corntest."

51:38.829 --> 51:40.829
Oh, it's on.

51:42.766 --> 51:44.157
You're going down, Woodcock.

51:44.167 --> 51:46.026
You must like
getting spanked, Farley.

51:46.036 --> 51:48.061
- I guess it runs in the family.
- Here you go, boys.

51:48.071 --> 51:49.162
Begin!

51:49.172 --> 51:51.965
Oh, I shoulda known
that you'd be here.

51:51.975 --> 51:56.002
You know, Johnny won this competition
what, 6 times in a row?

51:56.012 --> 51:58.004
- 7. 7.
- When he was little. 7 times!

51:58.014 --> 51:59.973
And against adults, too!

51:59.983 --> 52:02.943
And here we go, corn-testants!
And may the best--

52:02.953 --> 52:05.679
Oh, they're getting ready to go
so we'll just go over here.

52:05.689 --> 52:08.482
- Remember, half cobs do not count.
- Good luck!

52:08.492 --> 52:11.084
See you, girls.
That's funny, Farley.

52:11.094 --> 52:13.153
I didn't know fat kids
ate their vegetables.

52:13.163 --> 52:15.021
Save it for the corn-test, old man.

52:15.031 --> 52:16.490
- Ready for this?
- Yes!

52:16.500 --> 52:18.725
Are the corn-testants ready for this?

52:18.735 --> 52:22.796
If you are ready, then get set...

52:24.674 --> 52:26.967
There they go,
ladies and gentlemen...

52:26.977 --> 52:28.568
look at them gnaw on that corn!

52:28.578 --> 52:30.603
Do you see those teeth?

52:33.817 --> 52:35.942
Half a cob doesn't count.

52:38.989 --> 52:40.480
Pretty good there, Farley?

52:40.490 --> 52:42.349
Keep it going. Look there.
Look at them go.

52:42.359 --> 52:44.017
You want to pace yourself, Farley.

52:44.027 --> 52:46.621
Just let go, Woodcock.

52:46.663 --> 52:51.024
Great tension. Hey, hey, keep your hand off
your neighbor's cob!

52:51.034 --> 52:53.195
Penalty!

52:53.236 --> 52:56.863
All right, here we go.
Keep chewing that corn!

52:56.873 --> 52:57.998
10 seconds left!

52:58.008 --> 52:59.866
Coming down to the end now.

52:59.876 --> 53:04.472
5, 4, 3...

53:04.514 --> 53:06.514
2, 1!

53:20.530 --> 53:23.456
Ladies and gentlemen,
we have a winner!

53:23.466 --> 53:26.594
And that winner is, again...

53:26.636 --> 53:28.632
- John Farley!
- Whoo!

53:28.642 --> 53:34.042
Ha ha ha! Yes! Whoo!
You got beat, sweetheart!

53:34.077 --> 53:36.671
Whoo! Whoo!

53:36.713 --> 53:40.140
Whooooooo-hoo-hoo!
Whoo-whoo-whoo! Ha ha ha!

53:40.150 --> 53:44.587
Oh, yeah, baby! Whoo!
Whooo-hoo-hoo!

53:44.621 --> 53:46.953
I'm the big winner. I win!

53:46.990 --> 53:50.083
I'm the big winner
'cause this is my house, bitch!

53:50.093 --> 53:52.719
- Whoo-hoo!
- John Michael Farley!

53:52.729 --> 53:55.061
What has come over you?

53:58.235 --> 54:00.235
Ugh!

54:01.037 --> 54:04.464
It's OK, Farley.
I know how to cheer her up.

54:04.474 --> 54:07.671
Do me a favor. Snag my bears.

54:07.711 --> 54:11.238
Well, John, you really...
ate that corn.

54:16.086 --> 54:18.086
Thanks.

54:36.573 --> 54:37.998
- Hello?
- Wake up!

54:38.008 --> 54:40.066
I got something to show you.

54:40.076 --> 54:42.035
Nedderman? What's going on?

54:42.045 --> 54:43.737
And at 0800 hours...

54:43.747 --> 54:45.538
a blonde chick
rolled up in that car...

54:45.548 --> 54:47.007
and went into Woodcock's house.

54:47.017 --> 54:51.647
How long you been
staking out his house?

54:51.688 --> 54:53.688
17, 18 hours.

54:56.192 --> 54:58.285
Hey...there she is!

54:58.328 --> 55:02.321
- What?
- Oh, that son of a bitch!

55:02.365 --> 55:04.190
What kind of asshole
would cheat on his wife...

55:04.200 --> 55:05.659
before he's even married?

55:05.669 --> 55:07.994
The same kind of asshole that
would make a kid run laps...

55:08.004 --> 55:09.796
until his nipples bleed.

55:09.806 --> 55:11.806
Shit!

55:20.917 --> 55:23.510
Now, then.
We gotta go in there.

55:23.520 --> 55:26.680
Oh, bro, staking out
the guy's place is one thing...

55:26.690 --> 55:28.281
but breaking and entering,
that's another.

55:28.291 --> 55:30.684
Nedderman,
we need concrete proof.

55:30.694 --> 55:32.018
John, I haven't shit my pants...

55:32.028 --> 55:33.820
since the balance beam
in the 7th grade.

55:33.830 --> 55:36.222
I--I--I'd like to keep it that way.

55:36.232 --> 55:37.924
And what about your book,
chapter 14?

55:37.934 --> 55:40.560
"Respect other people's boundaries."

55:40.570 --> 55:42.228
Wait, do you have the book with you?

55:42.238 --> 55:43.563
Yeah.

55:43.573 --> 55:45.573
Oh, great.

55:46.076 --> 55:48.374
Let me see this. See.

55:51.214 --> 55:54.149
Forget the book! Just forget it!

55:55.685 --> 55:57.477
I can't take this book anymore!

55:57.487 --> 56:00.780
'Cause every 30 seconds you're
in my ear, like, wah, wah, wah!

56:00.790 --> 56:04.050
I can't do it, OK?
I wrote it, I know what's in it!

56:04.060 --> 56:07.029
It's crap! I'm done with it, OK?

56:09.232 --> 56:10.490
What?

56:10.500 --> 56:12.559
Hey...it's Tracy.

56:13.970 --> 56:15.795
Hey, Tracy.

56:15.805 --> 56:18.672
- How are you?
- Fine. Um...

56:18.708 --> 56:20.300
listen, John, about last night.

56:20.310 --> 56:23.703
You seem like you're in
a really weird place right now.

56:23.713 --> 56:27.945
Really? No, I feel great.

56:27.984 --> 56:29.142
I really do.

56:29.152 --> 56:32.315
Well, maybe you should
just call me...

56:32.355 --> 56:35.548
when things are
a little more...stable?

56:35.558 --> 56:37.283
I think that'd be best.

56:37.293 --> 56:39.318
Oh.

56:39.362 --> 56:41.362
OK, um...

56:42.665 --> 56:45.658
I respect your feelings
and your decision. I--

56:45.668 --> 56:47.861
I'm sorry you feel that way.

56:47.871 --> 56:51.441
All right. Well,
take care of yourself, OK?

56:52.275 --> 56:53.566
Yep, you too.

56:53.576 --> 56:55.001
Bye.

56:55.011 --> 56:57.011
Bye.

57:02.018 --> 57:03.443
OK, this is the plan.

57:03.453 --> 57:05.011
We're gonna break into
Woodcock's place.

57:05.021 --> 57:06.346
We're gonna plant
your video camera...

57:06.356 --> 57:07.714
then we're gonna catch him
cheating on my mom...

57:07.724 --> 57:09.416
and then we're gonna finish
this effing fiasco...

57:09.426 --> 57:11.151
once and for all, OK?

57:11.161 --> 57:14.487
Right, Clark, give me
the minicam. You're on lookout.

57:14.497 --> 57:18.747
Anything happens, honk the horn,
you understand me?

57:33.616 --> 57:35.880
Nedderman! It's open.

57:46.596 --> 57:48.596
What the--

57:52.302 --> 57:54.027
- What are you doing?
- Sor--

57:54.037 --> 57:55.895
I'm sorry. Sorry.

57:55.905 --> 57:57.905
- Jesus.
- OK.

58:19.929 --> 58:21.929
Hello, smoking gun.

58:30.406 --> 58:32.406
Damn it, Clark!

58:33.610 --> 58:35.610
Oh, shit!

58:37.914 --> 58:39.506
Nedderman?

58:39.516 --> 58:41.516
Nedderman!

58:51.661 --> 58:53.620
Jasper, I'm still upset with you.

58:53.630 --> 58:55.922
I know, honey,
but you know how I get...

58:55.932 --> 58:58.124
- when I don't have you to myself.
- Aah.

58:58.134 --> 59:00.727
- I just need some...alone time.
- What about me?

59:00.737 --> 59:03.897
Well, honey, it wouldn't be
alone time without you.

59:03.907 --> 59:06.232
- You know what I mean!
- Ha ha ha!

59:06.242 --> 59:09.109
Jasper, you charmer. Oh!

59:09.145 --> 59:11.978
Mmmmmm!

59:12.015 --> 59:15.143
Oh, honey. Oh, darling.

59:15.184 --> 59:17.184
Bad boy!

59:19.088 --> 59:22.057
- Feel good, baby?
- Yes! Yes!

59:22.091 --> 59:23.616
Rhetorical question, Beverly!

59:23.626 --> 59:26.176
- Oh, God! Oh, God!
- Oh, yeah!

59:26.195 --> 59:28.221
- Feel the love!
- I don't want to black out again.

59:28.231 --> 59:31.121
The finish line's in sight, honey.

59:35.438 --> 59:37.599
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

59:37.640 --> 59:40.541
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Yes!

59:51.187 --> 59:55.352
That was way better than
anything on the Internet.

01:00:01.731 --> 01:00:03.222
Excuse me,
may I have your attention?

01:00:03.232 --> 01:00:06.025
Uh, if everyone
would, uh...would grab a seat...

01:00:06.035 --> 01:00:07.994
and I get the honorees up on stage...

01:00:08.004 --> 01:00:09.329
we can get started.

01:00:09.339 --> 01:00:12.932
For the past 26 years,
Jasper Woodcock's name...

01:00:12.942 --> 01:00:16.769
has been synonymous with
the words "physical education".

01:00:16.779 --> 01:00:18.204
Now, before we get
to the presentation...

01:00:18.214 --> 01:00:19.539
let's hear from some of the people...

01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:23.645
whose lives have been touched
by this great man.

01:00:23.686 --> 01:00:25.345
Honey, where were you?

01:00:25.355 --> 01:00:27.614
I thought you were gonna ride
with us. I was worried.

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:30.850
Sorry, Mom.
I--I needed some alone time.

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:32.856
Oh.

01:00:32.866 --> 01:00:37.925
My name is Zoe. And last summer,
my cat Raisins ran away.

01:00:37.967 --> 01:00:41.761
That man found her. Her collar
was caught on a fence.

01:00:41.771 --> 01:00:44.899
She was dead from stran--gulation.

01:00:44.941 --> 01:00:46.899
But she's in heaven now.

01:00:46.909 --> 01:00:50.564
Thank you for finding Raisins,
Mr. Woodcock.

01:00:54.384 --> 01:00:55.875
You're kidding me.

01:00:55.885 --> 01:00:57.276
When I was in his class...

01:00:57.286 --> 01:00:59.979
Mr. Woodcock found a brick
of marijuana in my locker.

01:00:59.989 --> 01:01:03.583
He could have sent me
to the principal, but no.

01:01:03.593 --> 01:01:05.652
He called the cops.

01:01:05.695 --> 01:01:09.589
And instead of going to
detention I did 6 years in juvi.

01:01:09.599 --> 01:01:13.226
Where I found my lord
and savior, Jesus Christ.

01:01:13.236 --> 01:01:14.427
Jesus Christ!

01:01:14.437 --> 01:01:17.830
And I have been
mostly drug-free ever since.

01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:21.139
Thank you, Mr. Woodcock.

01:01:21.177 --> 01:01:23.636
"Mr. Woodcock is
one of the best teachers.

01:01:23.646 --> 01:01:25.772
"He taught me how to play hard
and never give up.

01:01:25.782 --> 01:01:31.118
"Because of him, I got
a scholarship to play football.

01:01:31.154 --> 01:01:33.154
"In college."

01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:36.582
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Woodcock.

01:01:36.592 --> 01:01:38.592
What the fuck?

01:01:39.062 --> 01:01:41.120
Woodcock never talks down to us.

01:01:41.130 --> 01:01:43.122
He treats us just like everyone else.

01:01:43.132 --> 01:01:45.625
I named my kid after Woodcock.

01:01:45.635 --> 01:01:47.560
Woodcock taught me
how to be a man.

01:01:47.570 --> 01:01:49.362
Woodcock taught me
how to be a man.

01:01:49.372 --> 01:01:52.231
Woodcock taught me
how to be a man.

01:01:52.241 --> 01:01:53.566
Woodcock taught me CPR.

01:01:53.576 --> 01:01:55.301
- Woodcock saved my life.
- Bullshit!

01:01:55.311 --> 01:01:56.335
- Woodcock--
- Woodcock--

01:01:56.345 --> 01:01:57.370
- Woodcock--
- Woodcock--

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.705
Woodcock--

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:00.106
- Woodcock.
- Woodcock.

01:02:00.116 --> 01:02:02.380
Jasper Woodcock.

01:02:02.418 --> 01:02:04.443
Educator of the Year.

01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:17.765
Go, Jasper!

01:02:18.801 --> 01:02:21.099
Thanks a lot. Uh...

01:02:22.371 --> 01:02:24.371
appreciate it.

01:02:29.612 --> 01:02:31.037
Ha ha ha.

01:02:31.047 --> 01:02:33.039
That's, uh--that's good stuff,
Jasper. Thank you.

01:02:33.049 --> 01:02:34.140
Unbelievable!

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:37.125
We have one more award to give out.

01:02:39.889 --> 01:02:42.483
The Corn Cob Key.

01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:46.486
Given to those
who go off into the world...

01:02:46.496 --> 01:02:48.987
and make Forest Meadow proud.

01:02:49.031 --> 01:02:50.857
Right.

01:02:50.867 --> 01:02:54.564
Ladies and gentlemen, John Farley!

01:03:10.319 --> 01:03:12.378
Ha ha ha.

01:03:15.258 --> 01:03:17.750
Are you guys out of your minds?

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.760
Ha ha ha.

01:03:20.396 --> 01:03:23.263
Seriously. Am I the only one...

01:03:23.299 --> 01:03:24.557
that thinks that Woodcock's like...

01:03:24.567 --> 01:03:27.457
the biggest asshole on the planet?

01:03:33.376 --> 01:03:34.667
I mean, for 26 years...

01:03:34.677 --> 01:03:37.470
this guy's been pelting children
with basketballs...

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.738
at point-blank range.

01:03:38.748 --> 01:03:40.406
And now you're giving him
an award for it?

01:03:40.416 --> 01:03:42.542
- He should be in jail!
- Johnny. Johnny.

01:03:42.552 --> 01:03:45.077
I mean, is there any question
that he strangled this girl's cat?

01:03:45.087 --> 01:03:47.880
What--what was her name,
Raisins? Yeah, you know what?

01:03:47.890 --> 01:03:50.416
Go home, dig up Raisins,
perform an autopsy on him...

01:03:50.426 --> 01:03:53.019
you'll find out
it wasn't an accident.

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:57.279
Dogs don't strangle cats.
Sadistic gym teachers do.

01:03:58.568 --> 01:03:59.425
OK.

01:03:59.435 --> 01:04:01.627
Somebody put something
in the punch again this year!

01:04:01.637 --> 01:04:03.930
Wait, wait. No, no, I'm serious!

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:06.306
Look, he hates children.

01:04:07.577 --> 01:04:09.468
He killed one of my classmates.

01:04:09.478 --> 01:04:11.904
Yeah, after years of his abuse...

01:04:11.914 --> 01:04:13.372
Trevor Oates took his own life...

01:04:13.382 --> 01:04:15.441
and he died because of Woodcock.

01:04:15.451 --> 01:04:17.681
No, I didn't.

01:04:19.355 --> 01:04:22.248
- Oates, I thought you were dead.
- No.

01:04:22.258 --> 01:04:24.584
I had minor surgery a few years back.

01:04:24.594 --> 01:04:27.927
You know, to help with my wheezing.

01:04:29.465 --> 01:04:33.192
Whatever. Oates is alive.
Whoop-di-doo! Who gives a shit?

01:04:33.202 --> 01:04:35.027
- Johnny.
- I'm sorry.

01:04:35.037 --> 01:04:36.796
I'm sorry.
I know you hate to hear that.

01:04:36.806 --> 01:04:38.497
He's not what you think.

01:04:38.507 --> 01:04:40.566
You're brainwashed, people!

01:04:40.576 --> 01:04:43.469
Oh, just ask his ex-wife
right there, Sally Jensen.

01:04:43.479 --> 01:04:44.871
Tell them about all the man whoring...

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:47.373
he did behind your back
when you were married.

01:04:47.383 --> 01:04:49.942
Well, I think most of you know
I cheated on him.

01:04:49.952 --> 01:04:52.278
I'm--I'm sorry. What?
You cheated on him?

01:04:52.288 --> 01:04:55.915
A lot. I couldn't help it.
I was a sex addict.

01:04:55.925 --> 01:04:57.483
Am.

01:04:57.493 --> 01:04:59.493
Uh, was.

01:05:00.363 --> 01:05:01.888
Am. Ha ha ha.

01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:03.055
Yeah.

01:05:03.065 --> 01:05:04.390
All right, let's go.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:07.460
That's enough.
That's enough of that!

01:05:08.471 --> 01:05:10.930
- He's cheating on my mom!
- Johnny, sit down right now.

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:13.332
- That's enough, Farley.
- I'm sorry, Mom.

01:05:13.342 --> 01:05:14.934
You've been sneaking
behind my mom's back...

01:05:14.944 --> 01:05:16.435
with that blonde whore...

01:05:16.445 --> 01:05:19.141
right there, haven't you?

01:05:19.181 --> 01:05:20.940
That's my realtor, you moron.

01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:24.076
I was trying to surprise
your mother with a new house.

01:05:24.086 --> 01:05:28.336
Well, how come I found
her panties in your bedroom?

01:05:31.994 --> 01:05:34.120
Those are your mother's, Farley.

01:05:34.130 --> 01:05:35.988
Mom?

01:05:35.998 --> 01:05:38.858
Yeah. OK, Farley, you and me,
out in the hallway right now.

01:05:38.868 --> 01:05:40.293
Now!

01:05:40.303 --> 01:05:42.295
- Uhh!
- You disrespectful little shit!

01:05:42.305 --> 01:05:45.197
I'm gonna give you a good old-fashioned
Nebraska ass-whipping...

01:05:45.207 --> 01:05:46.465
till you shit yourself.

01:05:46.475 --> 01:05:47.900
Bring it, bro!

01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:49.635
I don't know what I'm gonna
enjoy more tonight...

01:05:49.645 --> 01:05:51.537
kicking your ass
or nailing your mother.

01:05:51.547 --> 01:05:54.267
- Oh!
- Let go of my son, Jasper.

01:05:55.985 --> 01:05:58.783
- Uh, Bev--
- Let go of my son.

01:05:58.821 --> 01:06:00.780
- Bev, I--
- You two are unbelievable.

01:06:00.790 --> 01:06:05.635
You won't be civil even though
it hurts and humiliates me.

01:06:15.471 --> 01:06:17.471
Mom!

01:06:26.515 --> 01:06:28.813
Mom, are you OK?

01:06:28.851 --> 01:06:31.411
Go away, John. Leave me alone.

01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:38.617
Maggie?

01:06:38.627 --> 01:06:41.354
I have been carting around
your damn luggage since Denver!

01:06:41.364 --> 01:06:44.724
Thanks to you blowing off the most
powerful woman in America...

01:06:44.734 --> 01:06:47.226
Walden Books has canceled
the rest of your appearances.

01:06:47.236 --> 01:06:49.628
- I don't believe this.
- I know.

01:06:49.638 --> 01:06:52.300
If only someone had warned you!

01:06:52.341 --> 01:06:54.600
- So it's over.
- No, not exactly.

01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:56.635
When you hear about this,
you're gonna want to take me...

01:06:56.645 --> 01:06:58.738
right here in your mommy's house.

01:06:58.748 --> 01:07:00.673
But first I have to pee.
Where's the bathroom?

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:03.175
You have indoor plumbing
in here, right?

01:07:03.185 --> 01:07:04.810
It's not like you deserve
the extra effort...

01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:07.480
but since my reputation's
on the line, I called in a favor.

01:07:07.490 --> 01:07:09.115
You're gonna do a remote interview...

01:07:09.125 --> 01:07:10.716
on The Tyra Banks Show!

01:07:10.726 --> 01:07:13.519
Tomorrow, 9am,
the diva of daytime talk...

01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:15.354
is gonna talk to you live...

01:07:15.364 --> 01:07:18.691
right from this dingy little
shithole you call home.

01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:21.251
Fine, good, whatever you need.

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:24.797
What I need is for you to focus...

01:07:24.807 --> 01:07:27.199
get it together, and point me
to the nearest liquor store.

01:07:27.209 --> 01:07:29.209
OK?

01:07:32.114 --> 01:07:34.206
OK, Tyra Banks, very nice.

01:07:34.216 --> 01:07:38.210
But if you do not know your shit
she will gut you like a fish.

01:07:38.220 --> 01:07:40.220
Oh, my Lord.

01:07:42.458 --> 01:07:44.717
You look very beautiful, Mrs. Farley.

01:07:44.727 --> 01:07:45.885
Thank you.

01:07:45.895 --> 01:07:48.788
She does know what decade it is, right?

01:07:48.798 --> 01:07:50.189
Mom, what are you doing?

01:07:50.199 --> 01:07:52.892
- I'm going to Cornival.
- Ha ha ha.

01:07:52.902 --> 01:07:56.047
I'm sorry, you hicks
just crack me up.

01:07:57.706 --> 01:07:59.365
Are you sure? I mean--

01:07:59.375 --> 01:08:01.969
After last night, you know--

01:08:02.011 --> 01:08:05.304
I have certain obligations.
I'm still the Corn Cob Queen.

01:08:05.314 --> 01:08:09.614
- Ha ha ha.
- But you'll be by yourself.

01:08:09.652 --> 01:08:12.244
John, I have been alone
on that float for 20 years.

01:08:12.254 --> 01:08:14.313
I think I can handle it.

01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:17.349
Mom, I'm so sorry about last night.

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:20.555
I...just totally lost my head.

01:08:21.964 --> 01:08:24.761
Do you remember Mr. Spanger?

01:08:24.800 --> 01:08:26.759
He was the first man
that I tried to date...

01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:28.828
after your father died.
I think you were 6.

01:08:28.837 --> 01:08:30.895
And you ran away
from the baby-sitter...

01:08:30.906 --> 01:08:33.698
and we spent the entire night
trying to find you.

01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:36.006
Yeah, I was under the sink.

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:40.840
Well, every time a man asked me
out, you either got sick...

01:08:40.850 --> 01:08:42.707
or you threw a tantrum...

01:08:42.718 --> 01:08:49.385
or you egged the car, or you did
something until I just gave up.

01:08:49.425 --> 01:08:53.691
Did you ever think of how I felt...

01:08:53.729 --> 01:08:56.720
on my own all these years?

01:08:58.033 --> 01:09:00.694
Uh, I guess...

01:09:00.736 --> 01:09:02.795
I thought you...had me.

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:08.375
Oh.

01:09:15.684 --> 01:09:17.376
All right, Mr. Farley. 20 seconds.

01:09:17.386 --> 01:09:20.679
Hey, game face.
Let's put the hillbilly drama on hold.

01:09:20.689 --> 01:09:23.515
America is waiting.
You look great.

01:09:23.526 --> 01:09:26.586
- This is gonna be fun.
- 15 seconds.

01:09:28.831 --> 01:09:31.524
- I can't do this.
- OK, I understand.

01:09:31.533 --> 01:09:33.158
- That's fine.
- Really?

01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:34.627
Of course not!

01:09:34.636 --> 01:09:37.162
Now sit your ass down
and get in front of the camera.

01:09:37.173 --> 01:09:39.698
Quiet on set.

01:09:39.742 --> 01:09:44.417
- All right, people, we're on the air in 3, 2--
- Smile.

01:09:46.015 --> 01:09:47.706
When I read
my next guest's book...

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:50.576
I knew I had to have him
on The Tyra Show.

01:09:50.586 --> 01:09:52.944
He's the best-selling author of
Letting Go...

01:09:52.955 --> 01:09:55.219
How To Get Past Your Past.

01:09:55.257 --> 01:09:58.350
Please welcome, via satellite
from Forest Meadow, Nebraska...

01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:59.952
John Farley!

01:09:59.962 --> 01:10:01.220
Hey, John, how you doing?

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:02.621
I feel great.

01:10:02.631 --> 01:10:04.557
Well, good. You should.

01:10:04.567 --> 01:10:05.758
I mean, your book is inspiring...

01:10:05.768 --> 01:10:07.927
so many people across this country.

01:10:07.937 --> 01:10:10.796
Who's been your biggest inspiration?

01:10:10.806 --> 01:10:12.331
- Uh, my mom.
- Aah.

01:10:12.341 --> 01:10:15.167
See, my mom is
my biggest inspiration too.

01:10:15.177 --> 01:10:17.503
I mean, I would not be where
I am today were it not--

01:10:17.513 --> 01:10:20.209
Johnny, do you ever think of...

01:10:20.249 --> 01:10:24.109
what it was like for me
to be on my own all those years?

01:10:24.119 --> 01:10:26.979
I mean, come on, you guys, give
it up for mommas everywhere!

01:10:26.989 --> 01:10:28.989
Whoo!

01:10:29.558 --> 01:10:31.853
I'm--I'm sorry. I gotta go.

01:10:38.334 --> 01:10:40.392
- John?
- You go back in there!

01:10:40.402 --> 01:10:42.928
- No, I won't!
- Go in there and sell that goddamn book!

01:10:42.938 --> 01:10:44.330
No, I won't! My mom needs me!

01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:45.764
I don't give a shit!

01:10:45.774 --> 01:10:47.233
You're gonna go in there
and say something...

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:49.001
or I'm gonna shove
my arm up your ass...

01:10:49.011 --> 01:10:50.302
and work you like a puppet!

01:10:50.312 --> 01:10:52.312
Let go of me!

01:10:53.315 --> 01:10:55.207
Fine! Run, you pussy!

01:10:55.217 --> 01:10:57.343
- Go back to your mommy!
- What a bitch!

01:10:57.353 --> 01:11:00.322
See if I care!

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:01.580
Quiet, please!

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:04.950
I don't know what to do!
I don't know what to do!

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:09.294
Ha ha ha. OK, John, take care.
He's helping people.

01:11:44.033 --> 01:11:46.900
- You back for more?
- Look.

01:11:46.935 --> 01:11:49.199
I screwed up, OK?

01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:50.896
Big time.

01:11:50.906 --> 01:11:54.342
I shouldn't have meddled. I--

01:11:54.376 --> 01:11:56.503
I'm...sorry.

01:11:59.315 --> 01:12:01.355
Are you wearing make-up?

01:12:02.084 --> 01:12:04.382
The truth is...

01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:07.713
I did it because
I wanted my mom to be happy.

01:12:07.723 --> 01:12:10.449
And as it turns out, the thing
that makes my mom happy...

01:12:10.459 --> 01:12:12.084
unbelievably...

01:12:12.094 --> 01:12:14.289
is you.

01:12:14.330 --> 01:12:16.021
It's too late.

01:12:16.031 --> 01:12:18.157
She's made her mind up, Farley.

01:12:18.167 --> 01:12:20.759
What? My mom's the best thing
that's ever happened to you.

01:12:20.769 --> 01:12:23.195
One day you'll date girls
and you'll understand.

01:12:23.205 --> 01:12:25.964
Once a woman makes her mind up...

01:12:25.974 --> 01:12:27.599
there's no changing it.

01:12:27.609 --> 01:12:30.043
Oh, I get it. You're scared.

01:12:30.079 --> 01:12:33.038
Your last marriage fell apart
because she was cheating on you.

01:12:33.048 --> 01:12:36.540
Again and again and again.

01:12:36.585 --> 01:12:39.778
The woman's a deviant, Farley.
Who cares?

01:12:39.788 --> 01:12:42.548
So you're scared
of getting hurt again?

01:12:42.558 --> 01:12:44.850
Hey, spare me
the self-help crap, OK?

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:47.019
You're not a guru.
You're a spoiled little kid...

01:12:47.029 --> 01:12:50.222
who can't seem to let go
of his momma's right tit.

01:12:50.232 --> 01:12:51.890
Oh, yeah?

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:55.300
Well, you're just
a pussy with a whistle!

01:12:58.207 --> 01:12:59.832
Really?

01:12:59.842 --> 01:13:01.700
You cocky little shit.

01:13:01.710 --> 01:13:04.169
Do you actually think
you're tougher than me?

01:13:04.179 --> 01:13:07.273
Oh. Any time, any place.

01:13:15.257 --> 01:13:17.350
Get the rentals, Farley.

01:13:29.471 --> 01:13:31.397
Seems like old times, doesn't it?

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:34.376
Yeah, well, a new day has come.

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:36.235
Ooh!

01:13:36.245 --> 01:13:38.404
That was called a takedown, Farley.

01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:42.714
OK. So that's
how it's gonna be, huh?

01:13:49.625 --> 01:13:51.183
Ah!

01:13:51.193 --> 01:13:53.085
Yep, now I'm gonna bring it,
Woodcock.

01:13:53.095 --> 01:13:55.427
You never shut up, do you?

01:13:55.464 --> 01:13:57.523
Why don't you make me?

01:14:02.037 --> 01:14:04.757
Time to earn your wings, Farley.

01:14:05.607 --> 01:14:07.566
It's called a suplex, Farley.

01:14:07.576 --> 01:14:09.201
It's one of my favorites.

01:14:09.211 --> 01:14:11.570
Here's another one of my favorites.

01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:14.208
The Vietcong shuffle.

01:14:14.249 --> 01:14:17.047
The reverse Vietcong shuffle!

01:14:17.085 --> 01:14:19.890
Here comes the thunder, Woodcock!

01:14:19.955 --> 01:14:21.955
Ooh!

01:14:24.059 --> 01:14:26.186
Heads up, Farley.

01:14:27.262 --> 01:14:29.492
- Say uncle!
- Pussy!

01:14:29.531 --> 01:14:31.590
- Say it!
- Pussy!

01:14:32.734 --> 01:14:34.734
Ow!

01:14:37.206 --> 01:14:39.766
Russian headlock!

01:14:39.808 --> 01:14:42.743
The gym teacher body slam!

01:14:46.648 --> 01:14:48.106
Are you OK?

01:14:48.116 --> 01:14:50.666
Rhetorical question, Woodcock!

01:14:59.027 --> 01:15:01.723
You remember me now, don't you?

01:15:01.763 --> 01:15:03.763
- Bitch!
- Uh! Uh!

01:15:11.607 --> 01:15:13.607
Mr. Woodcock?

01:15:15.844 --> 01:15:17.844
Oh, shit.

01:15:27.556 --> 01:15:31.126
Got a white male, 50s,
possible concussion.

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:34.219
What are those? Bite marks?

01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:36.229
Uh...

01:15:37.299 --> 01:15:39.658
Come on, Scooter.
Get that mask off of me.

01:15:39.668 --> 01:15:42.194
Oh, thank God.
I thought I'd killed you.

01:15:42.204 --> 01:15:45.397
You couldn't kill me with a shotgun
and a head start, Farley.

01:15:45.407 --> 01:15:48.267
Said by the man flat on his back
in an ambulance.

01:15:48.277 --> 01:15:53.340
Yeah, well, it's about time
you showed some backbone.

01:15:53.382 --> 01:15:55.040
Is that a compliment?

01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:56.241
Farley, I'm just saying...

01:15:56.251 --> 01:15:59.244
that you showed some sack
out there today, OK?

01:15:59.254 --> 01:16:00.779
Wow.

01:16:00.789 --> 01:16:03.949
Maybe there is a human being
hiding in there somewhere.

01:16:03.959 --> 01:16:06.885
I mean, seriously,
why can't you be nice to people?

01:16:06.895 --> 01:16:10.556
It--it's not healthy being
such a dick all the time.

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:12.357
You're gonna end up like your dad...

01:16:12.367 --> 01:16:15.234
just angry and bitter and alone.

01:16:15.270 --> 01:16:18.063
If that's what you want, then
fine, but I don't think it is.

01:16:18.073 --> 01:16:21.567
Now, right now, my mom is
on that float all by herself...

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:24.069
really wishing that you
were up there with her.

01:16:24.079 --> 01:16:26.570
The problem is...

01:16:26.615 --> 01:16:30.208
I don't think you got
the backbone to win her back.

01:16:30.218 --> 01:16:32.218
Oh, really?

01:16:35.958 --> 01:16:37.958
Watch out!

01:16:39.328 --> 01:16:41.420
Come on, Farley!
Step up the pace!

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:43.322
I could if you weren't
such a fat ass!

01:16:43.332 --> 01:16:45.425
Watch out! Excuse me!

01:16:45.467 --> 01:16:47.025
- Keppen! You're off tempo!
- Aah!

01:16:47.035 --> 01:16:49.261
- Watch out!
- You're flat, Mount-Gardner.

01:16:49.271 --> 01:16:51.296
- Excuse us! Hey!
- Oh!

01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:53.501
Excuse us!

01:16:53.542 --> 01:16:54.666
Come on, Farley!

01:16:54.676 --> 01:16:57.839
- Mom! Mom!
- Beverly! Beverly!

01:16:57.879 --> 01:17:00.370
Oh, my God, what happened?

01:17:00.415 --> 01:17:02.641
Jasper, why are you
on that gurney?

01:17:02.651 --> 01:17:06.311
I don't know, honey,
but I'm here to say that...

01:17:06.321 --> 01:17:08.046
I'm basically sorry.

01:17:08.056 --> 01:17:09.848
Basically sorry?

01:17:09.858 --> 01:17:12.451
Mom, for an emotional cripple
like Woodcock...

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:14.152
that's a huge step.

01:17:14.162 --> 01:17:16.989
Listen, I'm the one
who should be apologizing, OK?

01:17:16.999 --> 01:17:18.523
This is all my fault.

01:17:18.533 --> 01:17:20.459
Just give it another shot.

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:22.394
'Cause my lungs
are about to explode.

01:17:22.404 --> 01:17:24.634
Please, honey.

01:17:29.911 --> 01:17:31.911
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

01:17:32.881 --> 01:17:34.906
Stop! Stop!

01:17:36.284 --> 01:17:38.980
Mr. Woodcock!

01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:40.746
You OK?

01:17:40.756 --> 01:17:42.756
Nice work, Farley.

01:17:42.791 --> 01:17:46.418
There's one pothole in this town
and you managed to find it.

01:17:46.428 --> 01:17:48.658
Jasper! Oh, my God.

01:17:48.697 --> 01:17:50.522
Oh, my God, Jasper.

01:17:50.532 --> 01:17:52.591
Jasper.

01:17:52.634 --> 01:17:54.634
Are you OK?

01:17:58.807 --> 01:18:01.742
I'm sorry, Mom.

01:18:01.777 --> 01:18:03.935
I thought I was doing
the right thing.

01:18:03.945 --> 01:18:05.704
By killing him?

01:18:05.714 --> 01:18:08.342
I called 911, didn't I?

01:18:08.383 --> 01:18:11.216
Ha ha ha. Yes.

01:18:11.253 --> 01:18:14.079
For what it's worth,
I want you to be with Jasper.

01:18:14.089 --> 01:18:17.217
- I don't believe you.
- I do. I--

01:18:18.527 --> 01:18:21.189
If it means anything at all...

01:18:21.229 --> 01:18:23.229
you have my blessing.

01:18:29.671 --> 01:18:32.136
You can see Mr. Woodcock now.

01:18:36.945 --> 01:18:38.945
Listen, uh...

01:18:40.315 --> 01:18:43.546
I just want to say I'm--I'm sorry...

01:18:43.585 --> 01:18:47.410
About the "nailing your mother"
comment there.

01:18:52.327 --> 01:18:54.327
That's it?

01:18:54.696 --> 01:18:55.721
What do you mean?

01:18:55.731 --> 01:18:57.556
I thought you would apologize for--

01:18:57.566 --> 01:18:59.424
Mom, Mom.

01:18:59.434 --> 01:19:03.662
I know this is gonna be hard for
you to believe, coming from me.

01:19:03.672 --> 01:19:06.607
But Jasper is a good person.

01:19:06.641 --> 01:19:09.167
You see, somewhere around the
time Jasper was choking me--

01:19:09.177 --> 01:19:11.803
- Yeah, with your own foot.
- Right.

01:19:11.813 --> 01:19:14.714
I had a revelation.

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:16.842
You don't get past your past.

01:19:16.852 --> 01:19:19.116
You embrace it.

01:19:19.154 --> 01:19:21.113
And I'm not that fat little loser anymore...

01:19:21.123 --> 01:19:22.681
and that's because he pushed me.

01:19:22.691 --> 01:19:26.923
And, in a really weird way...

01:19:26.962 --> 01:19:29.852
he's a big part of who I am today.

01:19:32.033 --> 01:19:35.460
For Christ's sakes, it was just
a P.E. class, you fruitcake.

01:19:35.470 --> 01:19:37.665
- Jasper!
- Well, it was.

01:19:40.675 --> 01:19:42.675
See?

01:19:43.078 --> 01:19:44.903
Set of ten, Farley.

01:19:44.913 --> 01:19:46.938
- What?
- Just joking.

01:19:51.186 --> 01:19:54.986
# I see a bad moon rising #

01:19:56.358 --> 01:19:59.816
# I see trouble on the way #

01:20:01.897 --> 01:20:05.492
# I see earthquakes and lightning #

01:20:07.235 --> 01:20:09.931
Merry Christmas, Woodcock.

01:20:09.971 --> 01:20:12.011
Merry Christmas, Farley.

01:20:14.576 --> 01:20:16.434
I read your book.

01:20:16.444 --> 01:20:18.810
Really? What did you think?

01:20:18.847 --> 01:20:21.506
Well, that part about, uh,
treating others...

01:20:21.516 --> 01:20:23.508
how you want to be treated,
I guess that's all right.

01:20:23.518 --> 01:20:26.878
Yeah, I sort of stole that
from the Bible, but...

01:20:26.888 --> 01:20:28.814
I'll take credit for it.

01:20:28.824 --> 01:20:31.714
The rest of it's pretty much crap.

01:20:32.828 --> 01:20:34.653
What the hell, man?
That's my book!

01:20:34.663 --> 01:20:36.254
It's my book, Farley.

01:20:36.264 --> 01:20:38.990
You gave it to me.
I can do with it as I please.

01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:42.436
# I hear the voice
of rage and ruin #

01:20:44.573 --> 01:20:46.867
# Don't go around tonight #

01:20:46.877 --> 01:20:50.001
# Well, it's bound to
take your life #

01:20:50.011 --> 01:20:53.071
Oh, hey. Look, your new book.

01:20:53.114 --> 01:20:55.040
- Congrats, John.
- Let me see.

01:20:55.050 --> 01:20:58.610
- Congratulations.
- Oh, my gosh. Look at that.

01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:00.512
Oh, wow.

01:21:00.522 --> 01:21:01.847
Yeah, it's
really, really good, John.

01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:03.815
Wow, you read it?

01:21:03.825 --> 01:21:05.784
Don't make me lie on Christmas.

01:21:05.794 --> 01:21:07.552
Well, as long as we're
congratulating people...

01:21:07.562 --> 01:21:09.354
Beverly and I have
a little announcement.

01:21:09.364 --> 01:21:12.090
Recently, uh, one of my swimmers
took hold...

01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:13.124
Mm!

01:21:13.134 --> 01:21:17.469
And, uh, your mother's got
a little Woodcock in her.

01:21:17.672 --> 01:21:18.730
What?

01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:21.885
You're gonna be
a big brother, Farley.

01:21:22.277 --> 01:21:24.277
Just joking.

01:21:35.056 --> 01:21:36.781
# It could be ten
but then again #

01:21:36.791 --> 01:21:41.785
# I can't remember half an hour
since a quarter to four #

01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:44.289
# Throw on your clothes,
the second side of Surfer Rosa #

01:21:44.299 --> 01:21:47.525
# And you leave me
with my jaw on the floor #

01:21:47.535 --> 01:21:49.535
# Hey! #

01:21:51.006 --> 01:21:54.399
# Oh, just when you think
you're in control #

01:21:54.409 --> 01:21:56.568
# Just when you think
you've got a hold #

01:21:56.578 --> 01:21:58.336
# Just when you got on a roll #

01:21:58.346 --> 01:22:01.606
# Oh, here it goes, here it
goes, here it goes again #

01:22:01.616 --> 01:22:03.475
# Oh, here it goes again #

01:22:03.485 --> 01:22:06.444
# I shoulda known, shoulda
known, shoulda known again #

01:22:06.454 --> 01:22:09.287
# Oh, here it goes again #

01:22:09.324 --> 01:22:11.874
# Oh, oh, here it goes again #

01:22:14.696 --> 01:22:17.422
# It starts out easy, something
simple, something sleazy #

01:22:17.432 --> 01:22:21.026
# Something inching
past the edge of reserve #

01:22:21.036 --> 01:22:24.162
# Now through the lines
of cheap Venetian blinds #

01:22:24.172 --> 01:22:26.831
# Your car is pulling
off of the curb #

01:22:26.841 --> 01:22:28.841
# Hey! #

01:22:30.445 --> 01:22:33.672
# Oh, just when you think
you're in control #

01:22:33.682 --> 01:22:35.941
# Just when you think
you've got a hold #

01:22:35.951 --> 01:22:37.876
# Just when you've got on a roll #

01:22:37.886 --> 01:22:40.912
# Here it goes, here it goes,
here it goes again #

01:22:40.922 --> 01:22:42.681
# Oh, here it goes again #

01:22:42.691 --> 01:22:46.017
# I shoulda known, shoulda known,
shoulda known again #

01:22:46.027 --> 01:22:47.852
# But here it goes again #

01:22:47.862 --> 01:22:50.922
# Oh, here it goes,
oh, here it goes #

01:22:50.932 --> 01:22:53.091
# Oh, here it goes again #

01:22:53.101 --> 01:22:55.934
# Oh! Oh, here it goes again. #

01:23:00.935 --> 01:23:07.435
