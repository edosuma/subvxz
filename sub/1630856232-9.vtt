01:34.427 --> 01:35.512
Hey.

01:35.553 --> 01:37.847
I paired Bias and Jacquie.

01:37.889 --> 01:39.474
They're both country.

01:39.516 --> 01:42.435
They're completely different,
but they both have this sparkle,

01:42.477 --> 01:44.479
and I thought their energy
would, like,

01:44.521 --> 01:45.730
bounce off each other.

01:45.772 --> 01:47.440
I have to tell you something.
Tell me.

01:47.482 --> 01:50.276
Listening to you blind,
it was one experience.

01:50.318 --> 01:52.320
Now, of course,
I'm comparing it to Blake,

01:52.362 --> 01:55.949
and that song is just such
an iconic moment for him.

01:55.990 --> 01:58.410
Right.
And then when I turned around
and I saw your energy

01:58.451 --> 02:00.286
I was just like,
"Oh, my gosh, I like this guy."

02:00.328 --> 02:03.415
* I saw the light
in a sunrise *

02:03.456 --> 02:05.959
Bias: The blinds was such
a crazy experience.

02:06.001 --> 02:08.628
To see Reba turn around
and Gwen turn around,

02:08.670 --> 02:10.547
it was the breakthrough
that I was hoping for.

02:10.588 --> 02:13.550
I feel amazing after making
"The Voice."

02:13.591 --> 02:14.968
I mean,
you got the approval from

02:15.010 --> 02:16.094
the Queen of Country.

02:16.136 --> 02:17.178
And the
Queen of Shelton.

02:17.220 --> 02:19.389
And you're doing alright.

02:19.431 --> 02:21.057
I'm going to have
to go with Gwen.

02:21.099 --> 02:22.475
What?

02:22.517 --> 02:24.644
Being an artist has always been
a dream of mine,

02:24.686 --> 02:27.439
but it's honestly nerve-wracking
to do something different

02:27.480 --> 02:30.525
than what my family has done
for all of these years.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.068
Before I came to "The Voice,"

02:32.110 --> 02:34.446
I was a full-time
worship pastor.

02:34.487 --> 02:36.781
I was gigging
at Champy's Fried Chicken.

02:36.823 --> 02:38.033
Let's go, baby.

02:38.074 --> 02:40.160
But I'm done playing it safe.

02:40.201 --> 02:41.411
I left my job.

02:41.453 --> 02:43.788
I left my newlywed wife
at home.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.165
Like, this is what
I'm doing full-time.

02:45.206 --> 02:46.541
Hi.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.251
Karley and I haven't
even been married a year.

02:48.293 --> 02:51.838
I guess I was 15 years old when
I met her for the first time,

02:51.880 --> 02:54.799
and seven years later
down the road, we reconnected.

02:54.841 --> 02:57.177
I didn't think that I'd be
gone for this long

02:57.218 --> 02:58.803
during my first year
of marriage.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.514
But, I mean, there's no reward
if you don't take the risk,

03:01.556 --> 03:04.893
and this is the risk I'm willing
to take for my music career

03:04.934 --> 03:06.770
and for my future family's life.

03:06.811 --> 03:08.688
Well, I'm honored
to be your coach.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.941
I think you both have
that energy and that spirit.

You did it in the blinds.

as the girl that comes out

on top of the world.

9 or 10 times for this,

Yes!

don't give up on your dreams.

belt buckle here.

my daughter and I already knew
I was going to pick you.

When she came up,
she's like, "Gwen, right?
You're still going with Gwen?"

04:03.785 --> 04:06.287
Aw.
You're such
an inspiration for me.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.497
"Tragic Kingdom"
was everything.

Yes.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.458
I'm so excited
to work with Gwen.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.502
She's that grunge rock in me,
and I'm hoping to bring,

04:12.544 --> 04:14.379
like, a grunge-rock-country
type of vibe.

04:14.421 --> 04:17.257
I learned to her vocals
how to belt.

04:17.298 --> 04:21.011
Like, "Sunday Morning"
is, oh...

04:21.052 --> 04:22.220
better than cheesecake.

the song?

04:23.263 --> 04:25.598

* I only talk to God
when I need *

04:32.731 --> 04:35.775

04:35.817 --> 04:38.486
amazing lyrics,
actually on the radio,

04:38.528 --> 04:40.530

Jacquie and Bias

to know more about him.

05:12.270 --> 05:14.314
that I don't even know
how to put into words.

And your singing is perfect,
you know what I'm saying?

05:22.947 --> 05:26.409
As far as singing experience,
how did you get to this point?

05:26.451 --> 05:28.620
I'm kind of like
a city-slash-country girl.

05:28.661 --> 05:32.999
My first taste
of loving music was when I would

05:33.041 --> 05:35.168
go to my grandmother's house
for the summers.

05:35.210 --> 05:39.089
My uncle would play guitar.
That's when I fell in love.

05:39.130 --> 05:42.175
But growing up, I just got in
so many relationships

05:42.217 --> 05:43.510
that were unhealthy,

05:43.551 --> 05:45.470
and I hadn't
sang for a really long time,

05:45.512 --> 05:46.888
and then I had my daughter.

05:46.930 --> 05:48.598
I'm in a very healthy
relationship right now.

05:48.640 --> 05:51.434
All he does is support my music,
and I'm going into it

05:51.476 --> 05:53.186
because I know
this is where I belong.

05:53.228 --> 05:55.397
This is a recovery story
for me, you know?
Yeah.

05:55.438 --> 05:57.774
Music is
so therapeutic for me.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.484
And to be able to do that
as an artist

05:59.526 --> 06:01.528
and also have that
with my daughter --

06:01.569 --> 06:03.363
you know, she sings my songs
and she's like,

06:03.405 --> 06:04.864
"Mom, I love this song,"
you know?

06:04.906 --> 06:07.325
This song is perfect for you.
It is, yeah.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.036
You know, I think you need to
play on that with your own story

06:10.078 --> 06:12.288
even more, because it's going
to be healing for you.

06:12.330 --> 06:13.748
Okay.

06:13.790 --> 06:16.126
Jacquie: When I was
in my darkest relationship,

06:16.167 --> 06:18.044
I really did need a favor.

let's just say

I need a favor right now, too,
going up against Bias.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.053
I am silenced right now.

06:27.095 --> 06:29.222
I think people are going
to be shocked by it.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.558
It's almost like you're unaware
of your own weirdness

06:31.599 --> 06:32.767
in a good way.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.019
There's something about the way

06:34.060 --> 06:36.146
that you work your body,
it's very you,

06:36.187 --> 06:38.356
and I think you should
just keep going with that.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.858
Okay.
But TV's weird.

06:39.899 --> 06:42.569
You don't have to go as hard
as you think you do,

06:42.610 --> 06:44.738
because you might be
doing a karate chop,

06:44.779 --> 06:46.740
and they're on her face,

06:46.781 --> 06:49.159

your vocal up, right?
Got you.

what you're going to do

a similar --

06:54.956 --> 06:56.416
I mean, you're a way better
singer than me,

but I'm saying --
Oh, my God,
stop, Gwen.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.127
You're a similar tone
in the sense

06:59.169 --> 07:01.546
that we're a little bit nasally,
right?
Yeah.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.423
I think this is an opportunity
for you

"Yes, be who Bias is."

It's just an ultimate
confidence booster,

going into these battles.

how good of a singer
you actually are

at the stage presence

around the place,

during blinds

that you had the vocal
that you have.

you took it to another level.

She probably has a whole course
book on all the lessons

17:08.778 --> 17:10.030
that she could teach me.

17:10.071 --> 17:12.741
To be here right now --
I'm only 17 years old.

17:12.782 --> 17:13.992
Like, it's surreal.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.161
What an experience
for y'all.
I know, yeah.

17:16.202 --> 17:19.080
I got my contract,
got married, everything,

17:19.122 --> 17:21.082
the same year, '76.

17:21.124 --> 17:24.461
I was 21 and I --
pfft, stupid,

17:24.502 --> 17:26.129
didn't know anything
about the music business.

17:26.171 --> 17:29.049
I thought you got a record
on the radio and you're rich

17:29.090 --> 17:31.301
and you got a tour bus,
and...

17:31.343 --> 17:35.430
I didn't have a number-one
record from '76 to '83,

17:35.472 --> 17:37.432
so it was just little,
baby steps all the way up.

17:37.474 --> 17:38.683
Yeah.
That's what it is.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.310
It's about
chipping away at that goal.

17:40.352 --> 17:41.686
And I think being out here,
I mean,

17:41.728 --> 17:43.605
this is the ultimate
experience.

17:43.646 --> 17:45.440
Alison:
Having Reba coaching us,

17:45.482 --> 17:48.526
that was one of the coolest
moments of my life.

17:48.568 --> 17:52.322
I moved last August to LA
from Ann Arbor, Michigan,

17:52.364 --> 17:55.408
and I work writing
custom songs for customers

17:55.450 --> 17:57.452
who want a song
about their mom's birthday

17:57.494 --> 17:59.621
or their anniversary.

17:59.662 --> 18:01.831
And it allows me
to hone my craft

18:01.873 --> 18:03.792
songwriting and producing music,

18:03.833 --> 18:07.462
while also making enough money
to live in L.A.,

18:07.504 --> 18:10.965
but I really want to elevate
my career as an artist,

18:11.007 --> 18:13.093
so I auditioned for the show,

18:13.134 --> 18:15.303
and that
totally changed my routine.

18:15.345 --> 18:18.390
* It's like rain *

18:18.431 --> 18:20.975
Right before I went on,
I said, "I hope Reba turns."

18:21.017 --> 18:22.477
Even if all four had turned,

18:22.519 --> 18:24.854
she, I believe,
isthe right coach for me.

18:24.896 --> 18:27.273
She's done all different facets
of the industry.

18:27.315 --> 18:28.650
That's really inspiring,

18:28.692 --> 18:30.735
and I really see that
for my career, too.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.654
Reba, I just love
your warm presence.

18:32.696 --> 18:34.280
I'm like,
I'm so grateful.

18:34.322 --> 18:35.573
You're so amazing.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.033
You're sweet to say that.
Thank you.

18:37.075 --> 18:38.493
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

18:38.535 --> 18:41.621
Well, the song you sang,
Lauren Daigle, my buddy.

18:41.663 --> 18:43.665
I love it.
I wanted one of her songs,

18:43.707 --> 18:45.667
and it was hard
to narrow it down.

18:45.709 --> 18:47.002
Love this one.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.420
I'm a huge fan of Lauren Daigle.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.630
We've gotten to sing
together before,

18:50.672 --> 18:52.841
and I like songs
that touch my heart,

18:52.882 --> 18:54.300
and that's definitely
one of them.

18:54.342 --> 18:57.053
* You say I am loved *

18:57.095 --> 18:58.304
* When I can't *

18:58.346 --> 19:01.558
Angelina's voice
was soft, pure, sweet,

19:01.599 --> 19:04.310
but powerful
all at the same time.

19:04.352 --> 19:06.980
That's all the components
of a great singer.

19:07.022 --> 19:08.857
* And you say
I am loved *

19:08.898 --> 19:11.151
Alison's voice,
there's strength, range.

19:11.192 --> 19:14.029
When I turned for her,
what I heard was potential.

19:14.070 --> 19:16.698
Now I think the other coaches
are going to go,

19:16.740 --> 19:19.325
"Holy crap,
this gal can sing."

19:19.367 --> 19:21.244
* You say I am yours *

19:21.286 --> 19:23.246
Very good. Very good.

19:23.288 --> 19:26.624
Both of you guys
vocally, wonderful,

19:26.666 --> 19:29.878
but what sells the song
to me is emotion.

19:29.919 --> 19:33.048
If it's just words coming out
of your mouth with a melody,

19:33.089 --> 19:35.383
yeah, yeah.

19:35.425 --> 19:38.678
But if you come in
with this ball of energy

19:38.720 --> 19:41.848
at the pit of your stomach
that you've got to talk about,

19:41.890 --> 19:46.644
it's going to touch everybody
in a 75,000-seat stadium,

19:46.686 --> 19:48.480
because youfeel it.

19:48.521 --> 19:51.358
Now, this is a song,
in my mind,

19:51.399 --> 19:55.403
a conversation
between me and the Lord,

19:55.445 --> 19:59.407
and I am in
a very depressed state.

19:59.449 --> 20:00.950
I think I'm worthless.

20:00.992 --> 20:03.078
So when you are
singing this song,

20:03.119 --> 20:04.454
it's very humbling.

20:04.496 --> 20:06.831
It's baring your soul.

20:06.873 --> 20:10.043
So it's not much movement
when you're performing it.

20:10.085 --> 20:12.087
It's -- you're broken.

20:12.128 --> 20:14.506
Angelina: Being a singer
means being an actress,

20:14.547 --> 20:16.174
means being a storyteller,

20:16.216 --> 20:19.761
and to hear Reba's wise words,
it opened up this new alleyway

20:19.803 --> 20:22.806
for me to really represent
the words for once.

20:22.847 --> 20:27.602
* That tells me
I will never measure up *

20:27.644 --> 20:30.230
A lot in my life,
people have always

20:30.271 --> 20:31.523
called me confident and said,

20:31.564 --> 20:33.566
"Wow, you're so vibrant
and extroverted."

20:33.608 --> 20:36.569
But in my mind,
I never truly felt good enough.

20:36.611 --> 20:38.697
So when I sang this song,
it just feels like

20:38.738 --> 20:40.699
I'm opening up about
that part of myself

20:40.740 --> 20:43.326
that is kind of
scared to be here.

20:43.368 --> 20:46.830
* The trouble with love is *

20:46.871 --> 20:49.582
I'm only 17 years old,
and this is

20:49.624 --> 20:51.501
my first time
being on a big stage.

20:51.543 --> 20:53.920
My biggest performances
were at home,

20:53.962 --> 20:57.007
when we'd have guests over,
and my dad would be like,

20:57.048 --> 20:58.633
"Perform for us."

20:58.675 --> 21:00.427
But for me, new things

21:00.468 --> 21:03.304
is actually
the only constant in my life.

21:03.346 --> 21:05.306
I've lived
in seven countries already,

21:05.348 --> 21:07.517
so I feel like
with that upbringing,

21:07.559 --> 21:09.060
I have this adaptability

21:09.102 --> 21:11.813
that is only helping me
throughout this process,

21:11.855 --> 21:14.524
and I hope that I can continue
to prove myself

21:14.566 --> 21:16.192
and only get better.

21:16.234 --> 21:18.319
* You say I am strong *

21:18.361 --> 21:19.738
Reba:
Angelina got it right away.

21:19.779 --> 21:22.282
I mean, she got into that space,

21:22.323 --> 21:26.244
and then it transformed Alison,
and she lit up,

21:26.286 --> 21:29.497
and by the time we finished
their segment, I was bawling.

21:29.539 --> 21:31.499
* Oh, I believe *

21:31.541 --> 21:33.043
I mean, I threw
both hands in the air,

21:33.084 --> 21:35.170
praising the Lord.

21:35.211 --> 21:40.258
That's the kind of reaction
you want from an audience.

21:40.300 --> 21:42.010
I believe it.

21:42.052 --> 21:43.678
Absolutely, I believe it.

21:43.720 --> 21:45.472
Y'all hit me really hard.

21:45.513 --> 21:47.098
Oh, my God.
That was great.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.850
Love it, love it, love it.
Thank you so much.

21:48.892 --> 21:51.186
If they do that
on the battle round stage,

21:51.227 --> 21:53.605
I'm up Salt Creek
without a paddle,

21:53.646 --> 21:55.065
'cause they're both so good,

21:55.106 --> 21:56.858
it's going to be
even harder for me to choose.

21:56.900 --> 21:59.569
What we started with
up to right now?

21:59.611 --> 22:01.988
Yeah.
It's big.

22:02.030 --> 22:05.492
If you can walk on stage
and touch people's heart

22:05.533 --> 22:06.993
like you just touched mine...

22:07.035 --> 22:08.036
Yeah.

22:08.078 --> 22:10.080
...you've done
something terrific.

22:10.121 --> 22:13.291
When Reba got emotional,
that blew my mind.

22:13.333 --> 22:15.919
After the rehearsal, I really
have some new perspectives

22:15.960 --> 22:17.796
to think about when
I'm rehearsing.

that I'm hitting every note

can really come through.

so I thought that was really
beautiful and touching,

27:17.262 --> 27:18.638
so thank you for that,
ladies.

27:18.680 --> 27:19.889
Thank you, John.
Great job.

27:19.931 --> 27:21.641
Thank you.

27:21.683 --> 27:24.102
Thank you, coaches.

27:24.144 --> 27:25.645
Alright, Reba, you got
the final decision.

27:25.687 --> 27:27.981
Give us some thoughts on that
battle first, please.

27:28.023 --> 27:30.984
Girls, very good job.
I'm very proud of you.

27:31.026 --> 27:32.569
Lauren Daigle
is a good friend of mine.

27:32.610 --> 27:35.613
I know she will be
very proud of your performance.

27:35.655 --> 27:38.241
Emotion, to me, means a lot.

27:38.283 --> 27:41.911
If you can't portray
an emotion to your audience,

27:41.953 --> 27:44.039
it's a song.

27:44.080 --> 27:45.915
Y'all did that in rehearsals.

27:45.957 --> 27:48.168
You were still.
You were meaningful.

27:48.209 --> 27:50.920
You saw what it did to me.
I was crying.

27:50.962 --> 27:52.589
Today,
you went back to the way

27:52.630 --> 27:54.257
you did it the first time.

27:54.299 --> 27:57.052
I know you're a little nervous.
I totally understand that.

27:57.093 --> 27:59.471
You're both great vocalists,
and I'm very proud of you.

27:59.512 --> 28:02.640
Reba, tough call,
but the time has come.

28:02.682 --> 28:04.392
Who is the winner
of this battle?

28:04.434 --> 28:07.979
**

28:08.021 --> 28:13.109
You did a great job
here tonight.

28:13.151 --> 28:16.404
I'd say,
because of the emotion...

28:16.446 --> 28:19.324
the winner of this battle
is Alison.

28:19.366 --> 28:23.578
Congratulations! Alison, moving
on to the knockouts!

28:23.620 --> 28:24.913
Alison: I'm so excited.

28:24.954 --> 28:27.499
I'm still just,
like, coming off of it.

28:27.540 --> 28:28.750
Way to go, girl.

28:28.792 --> 28:30.168
Reba gives so much wisdom

28:30.210 --> 28:32.545
and she gave us so many
great points now today

28:32.587 --> 28:34.214
that, those are things
I'm going to work on

28:34.255 --> 28:35.965
and take to the next level.

28:36.007 --> 28:38.218
Daly:
Angelina Nazarian, everybody!

28:38.259 --> 28:41.137
Alison and Angelina
did a great job.

28:41.179 --> 28:42.931
I was really proud of them,

28:42.972 --> 28:45.266
but Alison
is a wonderful singer.

28:45.308 --> 28:48.144
She was a one-chair turn.
I believed in her then.

28:48.186 --> 28:49.729
I still believe in her now.

28:49.771 --> 28:51.106
Wow, Reba.

28:51.147 --> 28:52.941
The way you explained it
hit the nail on the head.

28:52.982 --> 28:54.734
That is wisdom.
Yeah.

28:54.776 --> 28:57.737
I've got a pairing that's
a 13-year-old and a 15-year-old.

28:57.779 --> 28:58.988
Oh, that's so hard.

28:59.030 --> 29:00.907
I always think of,
like, myself

29:00.949 --> 29:02.325
when I see
the kids leaving,

29:02.367 --> 29:03.910
because I remember
I was in a show like this,

29:03.952 --> 29:05.412
and if I had gotten
a "no" that day,

29:05.453 --> 29:07.455
it would have broken my heart
for the rest of my life.

29:07.497 --> 29:10.250
**

29:13.712 --> 29:14.879
* This is "The Voice" *

29:14.921 --> 29:17.048
Daly:
Welcome back to the battles.

29:17.090 --> 29:18.842
Julia: I'm glad I'm
doing this with you.

29:18.883 --> 29:20.719
Olivia: I know, right?
There's no one else
better than this.

29:20.760 --> 29:22.053
I'm super excited.
Yeah.

29:22.095 --> 29:23.263
I'm really excited.
We're about to see Niall

29:23.304 --> 29:24.764
after
our blind audition.

29:24.806 --> 29:26.266
I was nervous in the blinds.

29:26.307 --> 29:30.937
* Birds singing
in the sycamore tree *

29:30.979 --> 29:33.898
* Dream a little dream
of me *

29:33.940 --> 29:35.900
Niall turned around
and it shocked me.

29:35.942 --> 29:38.028
I, like, giggled.
I was like, "Oh, my God."

29:38.069 --> 29:39.988
I'm Julia Roome.

29:40.030 --> 29:42.073
I'm 13 years old and I live
in Warwick, New York.
She's 13 years old!

29:42.115 --> 29:43.700
Niall: What?
13?

29:43.742 --> 29:46.995
Oh, my gosh. My little muffin.
Can I have a hug?

29:47.037 --> 29:49.414
I actually love
being the youngest.

29:49.456 --> 29:51.374
Are you a One Direction fan?
Niall fan?

29:51.416 --> 29:54.294
I sure was.
Was?

29:54.336 --> 29:56.504
Sorry. Sorry!
I'm joking.

29:56.546 --> 29:58.006
Oopsie.

29:58.048 --> 29:59.466
I had goose bumps from the
second you opened your mouth.

29:59.507 --> 30:01.760
I started songwriting
when I was 10 years old.

30:01.801 --> 30:03.928
I would do some open mics.

30:03.970 --> 30:07.474
I've also had the chance to sing
at Amateur Night at The Apollo.

30:07.515 --> 30:09.809
Last year,
I started online school

30:09.851 --> 30:12.270
because I was able to get
more opportunities gigging.

30:12.312 --> 30:15.857
I play all the time.
I love doing gigs.

30:15.899 --> 30:17.192
I love connecting with people.

30:17.233 --> 30:19.569
One, two, three, go.
Hey-lo.

30:19.611 --> 30:21.696
Now, I'm super excited
to do battles.

30:21.738 --> 30:24.324
I'm doing it with one
of my best friends here.

30:24.366 --> 30:25.784
We got this.
We got this.
We got it.

30:25.825 --> 30:27.160
Ready?
Okay, let's go.

30:27.202 --> 30:29.954
And to be coached by
Niall is just amazing.

30:29.996 --> 30:31.206
I can't believe it.

30:31.247 --> 30:32.874
Hi.
Hello.

30:32.916 --> 30:35.543
How's it going?
Hi! It's going good.

30:35.585 --> 30:36.795
Julia and Olivia.

30:36.836 --> 30:38.797
I picked Sixpence None
the Richer, "Kiss Me."

30:38.838 --> 30:42.884
I felt like this was the perfect
song for both of their voices.

30:42.926 --> 30:46.638
It fits right in the middle
of Olivia's folky-pop voice

30:46.680 --> 30:49.474
and Julia's kind
of ethereal storyteller.

30:49.516 --> 30:51.101
This is one of my favorite songs
of all time.

30:51.142 --> 30:52.310
Oh, shoot.
Now I feel pressure.

30:52.352 --> 30:53.687
I know, right?
We can't mess it up.

30:53.728 --> 30:54.854
No, no pressure.

30:54.896 --> 30:56.272
Okay, no pressure.

30:56.314 --> 30:58.358
When this song was released,
it was in 1997.

30:58.400 --> 31:01.194
I wasn't born.
You were born in 2010, Julia.

31:01.236 --> 31:03.822
I was in there.
You were there somewhere.

31:03.863 --> 31:05.323
I was there somewhere.

31:05.365 --> 31:07.075
Have you become friends?

31:07.117 --> 31:08.868
We were friends
before this.

31:08.910 --> 31:10.453
We were friends before
we got paired.
We were, like,
tight before.

31:10.495 --> 31:12.080
No way.
I feel like
her older sister

31:12.122 --> 31:14.457
'cause she has a sister
who's my age,

31:14.499 --> 31:16.960
and then I have a little sister
who's her age,

31:17.002 --> 31:18.670
so it's like...
How cute.

31:18.712 --> 31:21.339
So when you paired us up,
I was like, "No!"

31:21.381 --> 31:24.509
Aw, what a treat this is.

31:24.551 --> 31:26.177
Now let's see
what you've been working on.

31:26.219 --> 31:29.180
Oh, my gosh.
Okay, let's go.

31:29.222 --> 31:34.185
* Kiss me,
out of the bearded barley *

31:34.227 --> 31:35.520
* Nightly *

31:35.562 --> 31:36.980
I love Julia.

31:37.022 --> 31:39.357
She's got that kind of
Broadway musical person in her.

31:39.399 --> 31:41.526
She's only 13, but she's
crazy mature for her age.

31:41.568 --> 31:43.445
There's something really special
about this girl.

31:43.486 --> 31:46.364
* You wear those shoes,
and I will wear that dress *

31:46.406 --> 31:48.199
I love that unique tone
that Olivia's got to her voice.

31:48.241 --> 31:51.536
It's very standout, makes your
ears perk up when you hear it.

31:51.578 --> 31:53.246
That goes a long way
in this competition,

31:53.288 --> 31:54.748
as we've seen
in last year's final.

31:54.789 --> 31:57.751
* So kiss me *

31:57.792 --> 31:59.794
At the blinds,
I sang "This Town" by Niall.

31:59.836 --> 32:03.340
* Waking up to kiss you
and nobody's there *

32:03.381 --> 32:05.967
I had two chairs turn around.

32:06.009 --> 32:07.427
It was like,
a whirlwind of emotions.

32:07.469 --> 32:08.887
Great song choice.

32:08.928 --> 32:10.096
Thank you so much.

32:10.138 --> 32:11.389
I know that one well.

32:11.431 --> 32:13.141
Then he's like,
sitting in front of me

32:13.183 --> 32:14.434
and he's like,
"I love your tone,"

32:14.476 --> 32:16.311
and I'm like, "Thank you."

32:16.353 --> 32:18.063
I'm going to have
to go with Niall.

32:18.104 --> 32:19.647
Yeah!

32:19.689 --> 32:21.399
I can't believe
I'm working with Niall.

32:21.441 --> 32:22.901
It doesn't feel real at all.

32:22.942 --> 32:24.402
As a songwriter,
as a storyteller,

32:24.444 --> 32:26.488
I think our styles
are very, very similar.

32:26.529 --> 32:29.240
* Out on the moonlit floor *

32:29.282 --> 32:31.785
I think that this song
sounds like a fairy tale,

32:31.826 --> 32:33.411
which I think is really cool,
because that's what

32:33.453 --> 32:34.579
high school is all about.

32:34.621 --> 32:36.206
I'm going into
my sophomore year,

32:36.247 --> 32:38.208
and I got into doing
the national anthem

32:38.249 --> 32:39.626
for my high school
varsity games.

32:39.668 --> 32:42.837
I did basketball,
I did wrestling, I did soccer.

32:42.879 --> 32:44.381
I have yet to do football,

32:44.422 --> 32:47.342
because the marching band
has that, but maybe one day.

32:47.384 --> 32:50.428
This song has the energy
of all these, like,

32:50.470 --> 32:51.846
teenage butterflies,

32:51.888 --> 32:54.099
which is something
I really hope I can portray.

32:54.140 --> 32:59.729
* Kiss me *

32:59.771 --> 33:01.523
* Kiss me, kiss me *

33:01.564 --> 33:02.982
We'll just clean up
that ending. [ Laughs ]

33:03.024 --> 33:04.651
Yeah. Sorry.

33:04.693 --> 33:07.821
[ Changing pitch ]
* Kiss me, me, me *

33:07.862 --> 33:09.280
That was so good.

33:09.322 --> 33:10.740
I like what you did
with the oohs, by the way.

33:10.782 --> 33:12.826
Don't be afraid to sing
those oohs at the end,

33:12.867 --> 33:14.285
sing them just
a little bit softer.

33:14.327 --> 33:15.453
Okay.
Softer?

33:15.495 --> 33:17.038
You don't have to, "ooh!"

33:17.080 --> 33:19.541
* Ohh, ohh *
Okay.

33:19.582 --> 33:21.626
You know, like you're
playing the organ yourself.

33:21.668 --> 33:23.920
When you're singing in harmony,
go for it.

33:23.962 --> 33:25.255
When you're not, phew.

33:25.296 --> 33:27.590
Yeah. Alright.
Keep it small and tasty.

33:27.632 --> 33:29.759
And even the ends of lines,
where you are harmonizing

33:29.801 --> 33:31.803
in verses and stuff like that,
just keep them nice and tight,

33:31.845 --> 33:33.722
because the big harmonies
are in the chorus,

33:33.763 --> 33:36.349
and that's where you get to
open up a little bit.

33:36.391 --> 33:37.976
I'm so proud of both
of you already.

33:38.018 --> 33:39.269
Thank you.

33:39.310 --> 33:40.562
Even though we're like,
best friends,

33:40.603 --> 33:42.731
we definitely
get nervous sometimes,

33:42.772 --> 33:44.274
especially singing
in front of Niall.

33:44.315 --> 33:46.651
So we just have to
make sure we connect

33:46.693 --> 33:48.653
and show
that connection on stage.

33:48.695 --> 33:50.321
If both of you were
to leave the competition,

33:50.363 --> 33:51.448
you could come back next year
as, like, a duo.

33:51.489 --> 33:53.950
A duo?
Yeah, we should.

33:53.992 --> 33:55.326
When you sing individually,

33:55.368 --> 33:56.536
you look like you're having
a lot of fun.

33:56.578 --> 33:57.912
Just let's turn it
into each other

33:57.954 --> 33:59.330
when you're singing together
and enjoy it.

33:59.372 --> 34:01.041
Win the hearts of the nation.

34:01.082 --> 34:02.584
We're
America's sweetheart.

34:02.625 --> 34:04.210
Yeah, like, a joint
America's sweetheart.

34:04.252 --> 34:05.754
There we go.

34:05.795 --> 34:08.548
This could be arguably
my favorite battle so far

34:08.590 --> 34:10.175
that I've been on
in "The Voice."

34:10.216 --> 34:11.718
[ Laughs ]
Stop right now.

34:11.760 --> 34:13.720
Their little vibe that they've
got going on is so funny.

34:13.762 --> 34:15.513
It makes me so excited
for this battle.

34:15.555 --> 34:17.557
You know where I am
if you need anything from me.

34:17.599 --> 34:19.684
Take that one.
You take that one.
Okay.

34:19.726 --> 34:21.644
I'm going to
leave it here...
[ Laughs ]

34:21.686 --> 34:24.022
I want to see who's having
the most fun up there on stage

34:24.064 --> 34:27.233
and who's ready
for the three-way knockouts.

34:27.275 --> 34:28.902
* Kiss me *

34:28.943 --> 34:30.612
* Beneath the milky
twilight *

34:30.653 --> 34:32.197
That's so fun.
That's what this show's about.

34:32.238 --> 34:35.533
Julie and Olivia, I'm going
to lose sleep over this one.

34:35.575 --> 34:37.619
I don't want to see
anyone go home.

Alright, alright.
Beautiful,
beautiful stuff.

38:09.205 --> 38:10.373
That was really fun.

38:10.415 --> 38:11.958
Oh, so cute.
I love these two.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.168
Especially, like,
doing this

38:13.209 --> 38:14.836
with my best friend
on the season.

38:14.878 --> 38:16.629
I'm just so happy
to do it with her.

38:16.671 --> 38:18.131
They're the best,
these two.

38:18.173 --> 38:19.341
They're so cute.

38:19.382 --> 38:20.675
John: Music is not about
competition.

38:20.717 --> 38:22.093
It's about
bridging divides

38:22.135 --> 38:24.429
and making us feel
more connected to each other,

38:24.471 --> 38:26.639
and I love
when you do it together

38:26.681 --> 38:28.350
in the way
that you did it.

38:28.391 --> 38:33.521
Julia, your voice isn't
exactly tuned for this song.

38:33.563 --> 38:34.898
You know,
you're more of a belter,

38:34.939 --> 38:36.399
but you sounded
so great.

38:36.441 --> 38:40.487
Olivia, your tone is so cool
and so perfect for the song

38:40.528 --> 38:44.491
that the only thing
that was holding me back
from enjoying it 100%

38:44.532 --> 38:47.118
was just a little more
accuracy and control

38:47.160 --> 38:48.411
when it came to pitch.

38:48.453 --> 38:49.704
Both of you are so young.

38:49.746 --> 38:51.206
This is the beginning
of your career.

38:51.247 --> 38:53.291
You're going to be great
no matter what,

38:53.333 --> 38:56.044
but if I were to choose,
I would pick Julia.

38:56.086 --> 38:57.504
Thank you so much.

38:57.545 --> 38:59.881
13 and 15, yep.

I'd have been crawling
on the floor.

I mean,
the confidence y'all had,

39:03.551 --> 39:05.011
it's just so inspiring.

39:05.053 --> 39:07.180
You gals really were great.

39:07.222 --> 39:08.306
I'm so proud of you.

39:08.348 --> 39:11.017
If I could give you
a little advice --

39:11.059 --> 39:13.311
stay in the moment of the song.

39:13.353 --> 39:16.981
When you're not singing,
stay in that moment, smile.

39:17.023 --> 39:20.402
Making contact with
the audience is very important,

39:20.443 --> 39:22.195
because they came to see you.

39:22.237 --> 39:23.905
Of course.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

39:23.947 --> 39:25.699
You both have
different tones,

39:25.740 --> 39:27.367
but they're both
really interesting.

39:27.409 --> 39:30.662
Julia, I love your lower tone,
like when you first came in.

39:30.704 --> 39:33.707
That part of your voice is
my favorite part of your voice.

39:33.748 --> 39:36.126
Olivia, you have
a very rare tone.

39:36.167 --> 39:38.545
You're so original
with your sound.

39:38.586 --> 39:42.215
You both have really a lot
of originality in your voice,

39:42.257 --> 39:43.675
and that's something
you can't learn.

how to tie my shoes at 16.

there's a real drama to it.

I was really struggling with,

40:29.220 --> 40:30.930
"Who do you think
is going to do it?"

40:30.972 --> 40:34.392
I'm like, "Help me, please."

40:34.434 --> 40:36.686
Please remember,
you're so young.

can and can't do.

in this competition now,

and not for a second
would you think so.

40:57.248 --> 41:00.001
She has this dreaminess
about her when she sings.

She knows
exactly who she is as an artist,

41:02.379 --> 41:03.922
even at this young age.

41:03.963 --> 41:07.258

was a little nervous.

I lost some breaths
a couple of times.

I was like,
"Ooh, got to fix that."

I'm going to
the three-way knockouts!

41:19.312 --> 41:21.648
Olivia, anything you'd like
to say to your coach?

41:21.690 --> 41:26.486
I just want to say thank you.
It's been really fun.

41:26.528 --> 41:28.655
As a coach, I think you were
definitely the best pick.

We're right here,
okay?

41:30.532 --> 41:33.743
Sorry. I'm so sorry.

You were so good.
It's so hard to make a decision.

41:47.048 --> 41:48.842
That was so tough
to see Olivia go.

41:48.883 --> 41:50.385
It's going to break my heart
for a long time,

41:50.427 --> 41:53.013
but I know for a fact, with that
tone and that personality,

41:53.054 --> 41:54.597
she's going to have
a very bright future.

41:54.639 --> 41:57.434
So good, Olivia!

She's cute as a button.

have been very difficult.

At this point,
everybody's talented.

42:05.567 --> 42:07.610
I didn't steal,
because I need somebody

42:07.652 --> 42:11.489
that will bring a different
kind of energy to my team.

last year.

How do you feel
about your team so far?

42:29.299 --> 42:31.009
I'm feeling really good,
yeah.

I feel that all of my team
have stepped up, you know,

42:33.887 --> 42:35.597
to the battle rounds,
have gotten even better.

42:35.638 --> 42:38.099
Some of the growth I've seen
so far has been insane.

42:38.141 --> 42:39.768
I've done this
seven seasons,

42:39.809 --> 42:41.061
and every time,
it blows me away.

42:41.102 --> 42:43.021
Also, just watching
the other teams,

42:43.063 --> 42:45.148
because you don't get that time
with them in between,

42:45.190 --> 42:48.276
and you just see this big jump
from the blinds to the battles.

42:48.318 --> 42:49.778
It's just
so inspiring.

42:49.819 --> 42:51.071
I kind of always
struggle with

42:51.112 --> 42:53.114
the younger contestants
that leave.

42:53.156 --> 42:55.950
Olivia left,
and she's 15 years old,

42:55.992 --> 42:58.119
and in her head, she could
potentially be thinking,

42:58.161 --> 42:59.871
"This is the end of it.
It's all over for me."

42:59.913 --> 43:01.414
Oh, my gosh.
Surely not.

43:01.456 --> 43:02.957
But you helped her so much,
because you have the experience.

43:02.999 --> 43:04.793
You were young also
on a show like this.

43:04.834 --> 43:06.002
I think that goes
a long way.

Did you guys win?
No, came third.

43:07.504 --> 43:09.464
He didn't win.
There you go.
More of an example.

no saves.

Oh,
I love the steals.

steals, because I have to yell,

You will be battling
Willie Gomez.

Stee: I shouldn't be surprised
that he put us together,

43:35.865 --> 43:37.075
but I was surprised.

43:37.117 --> 43:38.993
But as soon as we started
to work together,

43:39.035 --> 43:40.412
it made perfect sense.

43:40.453 --> 43:42.789
Willie: Stee's energy
and his presence on stage

43:42.831 --> 43:44.165
is pretty amazing.

to the occasion with him.

43:49.546 --> 43:51.423
Willie:
We both had a four-chair turn,

so I think we're going to bring
the fire to the stage.

43:54.217 --> 43:55.677
John: Stee, Willie!

43:55.719 --> 43:58.179
What's up?
What's up, man?

43:58.221 --> 43:59.848
Welcome to the battles.

43:59.889 --> 44:04.227
John Legend is an incredible
musician, an incredible writer.

44:04.269 --> 44:06.312
This is one of my
favorite times on the show.

44:06.354 --> 44:08.314
I just felt like you
can really open up

44:08.356 --> 44:10.608
and stretch yourself
artistically with him,

44:10.650 --> 44:12.152
and I'm ready to learn.

44:12.193 --> 44:13.611
What have you guys been up to
since I last saw you?

44:13.653 --> 44:16.406
I went to Miami for a little bit
to see my family.

44:16.448 --> 44:17.490
I did some gigs.

44:17.532 --> 44:19.409
Are you dancing
or singing or both?

44:19.451 --> 44:21.161
I was dancing --
I actually did a gig

44:21.202 --> 44:22.787
with Lana Del Rey
in Rhode Island recently.

44:22.829 --> 44:24.372
Oh, cool.

44:24.414 --> 44:27.417
Willie: Moving from Miami to
Los Angeles was definitely hard.

44:27.459 --> 44:29.044
I was already
working as a dancer

44:29.085 --> 44:31.504
in the industry in Miami,
so to get to a new city

44:31.546 --> 44:35.050
and start from zero again
was a little scary.

44:35.091 --> 44:37.302
I started doing
food service delivery

44:37.344 --> 44:39.554
just to make some extra money
and pay for bills

44:39.596 --> 44:40.805
and for the music.

44:40.847 --> 44:42.015
That's not cheap.

a dream come true.

So the song we picked,
the song "Tacones Rojos,"

45:00.283 --> 45:01.576
which means "red high heels."

45:01.618 --> 45:03.620
It has special meaning for me,
of course.

45:03.661 --> 45:05.121
It's your song!

45:05.163 --> 45:08.416
I paired Stee and Willie,
two of my four-chair turns.

45:08.458 --> 45:10.710
Willie in the blinds
did Latin pop.

45:10.752 --> 45:11.961
Stee did pop.

45:12.003 --> 45:14.130
* Oh, your love
is like magic *

45:14.172 --> 45:17.592
I feel like, why not do
a duet of a song

45:17.634 --> 45:20.261
that I did with my friend
Sebastián Yatra?

45:20.303 --> 45:22.597
Sebastian actually won

45:22.639 --> 45:24.683
the Best Pop Song
at the Latin Grammys.

45:24.724 --> 45:28.061
The perfect song
to bring their styles together.

45:28.103 --> 45:29.688
* I'm in heaven when I *

45:29.729 --> 45:31.856
* Watch you dance
to reggaetón *

45:31.898 --> 45:33.358
* With your red heels high *

45:33.400 --> 45:35.443
Stee:
John trusted us with his art.

45:35.485 --> 45:36.695
* Yeahhh *

45:36.736 --> 45:38.113
I mean, it doesn't get
any better than that.

45:38.154 --> 45:40.281
Really? Me? Okay.

45:40.323 --> 45:42.742
I'll make you proud, I think.
[ Laughs ]

45:42.784 --> 45:44.327
* Sugar *

45:44.369 --> 45:47.288
The blinds were a whirlwind.

45:47.330 --> 45:51.960
All four chairs turned,
and I saw a block on the floor.

45:52.002 --> 45:54.045
To get that validation
is incredible.

45:54.087 --> 45:56.423
Trying to get into
the music industry,

45:56.464 --> 45:58.466
a lot of people can be unkind.

45:58.508 --> 46:00.760
Going through puberty,
I was a little hefty.

46:00.802 --> 46:03.722
People said, "Oh, you need to go
to a fat boys' school."

46:03.763 --> 46:05.432
All the awful things
that they said,

46:05.473 --> 46:08.059
it just teaches you
so much about tenacity.

46:08.101 --> 46:10.145
Welcome to Team Legend!

46:10.186 --> 46:12.230
Which is why it's still surreal.

46:12.272 --> 46:13.314
Together:
* I never met somebody *

46:13.356 --> 46:14.649
Stee: I want to do well,

46:14.691 --> 46:17.360
and it's not time for me
to celebrate...

46:17.402 --> 46:20.155
* I never met somebody *

46:20.196 --> 46:21.406
...because I'm still
in the game.

46:21.448 --> 46:24.075
* Ba-da-da, ba-ba *

46:24.117 --> 46:25.577
That's fun.
Yeah.
[ Laughs ]

46:25.618 --> 46:27.704
I like the harmony choices.
Thank you.

46:27.746 --> 46:29.914
Willie, when you're singing
those big notes,

46:29.956 --> 46:31.583
don't pull
the mic away too much.

46:31.624 --> 46:33.168
I feel like you're being --
It's almost like an insecurity.

46:33.209 --> 46:34.961
Yeah.
Like, you sound great.

46:35.003 --> 46:36.171
Thank you.
Thank you, thank you.

46:36.212 --> 46:37.547
It's really good, guys.

46:37.589 --> 46:39.341
The only thing I don't like
is I feel like

46:39.382 --> 46:43.720
there's too much Stee
on that first chorus.

46:43.762 --> 46:45.221
It feels like you guys
should split it more.

46:45.263 --> 46:46.514
Stee, do that first line.

46:46.556 --> 46:48.141
* Baby, you're
making me dance *

46:48.183 --> 46:49.976
Willie, then,
"You hurt me so good."

46:50.018 --> 46:52.062
"Think I'm about to cry."
* Think I'm
about to cry *

46:52.103 --> 46:53.396
And then Stee goes,

46:53.438 --> 46:55.023
* I feel so lucky,
lovely *

46:55.065 --> 46:57.317
And then do both.
* I never
met somebody *

46:57.359 --> 47:00.070
Willie: For me, collaboration
and duet is a new thing.

47:00.111 --> 47:02.030
* So high *
Yes.

47:02.072 --> 47:03.531
Willie:
Stee is a strong performer,

47:03.573 --> 47:05.992
and that can be
a little intimidating.

47:06.034 --> 47:08.745
It's definitely pushing me
out of my comfort zone

47:08.787 --> 47:10.330
in this round.

47:10.372 --> 47:13.208
On the part --
* I never met somebody, yeah *

47:13.249 --> 47:14.626
In the second time through,

47:14.668 --> 47:16.503
you guys should both end it off
a little sooner.

47:16.544 --> 47:20.048
* Ba-da-da, da-da,
da-da-la *

47:20.090 --> 47:22.884
* I never met somebody *

47:22.926 --> 47:24.469
* El día
que te conocí*

47:24.511 --> 47:26.221
Stee: I got a steep competitor.

47:26.262 --> 47:27.889
No room for error at this point.

47:27.931 --> 47:29.349
* I never met somebody *

47:29.391 --> 47:33.687
So I honestly have to impress
John and show him,

47:33.728 --> 47:35.563
"You can bet on me, man."

47:35.605 --> 47:36.898
I like the liberties
you took with it.

47:36.940 --> 47:38.650
It was all, like,
well-chosen, smartly done.

47:38.692 --> 47:39.693
Beautiful.

47:39.734 --> 47:42.487
Stee's voice
is rich and powerful.

47:42.529 --> 47:44.155
He's got such charisma,

47:44.197 --> 47:49.035
but Willie was more in tune
with the look and the vibe.

47:49.077 --> 47:52.038
I'm still mad about
having no saves in this round.

47:52.080 --> 47:53.289
You guys sound incredible.

47:53.331 --> 47:54.749
I'm just mad
I'm going to have to

47:54.791 --> 47:58.086
say goodbye to one person
on each of these battles.

47:58.128 --> 47:59.754
This is painful.

I turned for both of y'all
during the auditions.

with each other,

the other one was

cheering them on and being
a part of the moment.

your voice is incredible.

and your moves and everything.

51:19.621 --> 51:20.914
And, Willie,
you're great.

51:20.955 --> 51:22.874
You sing in both languages,
which is --

51:22.916 --> 51:26.836
I can't do that.
I can barely sing good English.

51:26.878 --> 51:29.339

and good English.

I guess if I just had
to help you out

51:40.058 --> 51:42.519
and just pick one,
I guess, Willie, you'd be it.

when two four-chair turns

go against each other
in a battle.

51:51.986 --> 51:53.571
That's what I was
thinking, yep.

And it was a great song choice,
by the way, John.

it is one of your songs.

your voice is just so cool.

Thank you.
It's such a unique tone.
So impressive.

And, Willie, you're just a great
all-round package in my head.

52:04.958 --> 52:07.293
The fact that you can sing
in two languages and dance

52:07.335 --> 52:09.212
says a lot about what
your future could look like.

a straightforward --

myself right now.

52:16.928 --> 52:19.139
I just feel like I would --
just package alone,

that you're doing,

my eyes off you.

cutie over here, Willie.

52:41.494 --> 52:43.038
Your voice
is beautiful, as well.

it's full at the same time.

a battle with dancing

in this moment,

I would lean towards Stee.

your thoughts first.

that it's both airy
and powerful at the same time.

53:45.016 --> 53:47.977

just so great together.

53:48.019 --> 53:49.729
You arranged it
so well together.

Like, I didn't come up with
any of those arrangement ideas.

Wow, good for you.

53:54.526 --> 53:55.902
That's great.

53:55.944 --> 53:58.279
My man.
What are you going to do?

53:58.321 --> 54:00.156
I've stalled enough.

54:00.198 --> 54:02.117
Uh...
[ Chuckles ]

54:02.158 --> 54:04.994
I have a decision to make,
and I hate this.

54:05.036 --> 54:05.995
Um...

54:06.037 --> 54:11.835
**

54:11.876 --> 54:14.254
The winner of
this battle...

54:14.295 --> 54:19.592
**

54:24.389 --> 54:25.724
* This is "The Voice" *

54:25.765 --> 54:30.145
Daly: Welcome back to
night two of the battles.

54:30.186 --> 54:32.939
Mm...

54:32.981 --> 54:34.065
I hate this.

54:34.107 --> 54:36.693
Um...

54:36.735 --> 54:41.448
The winner
of this battle...

54:41.489 --> 54:43.366
is Stee.
[ Gasps ] Whoo!

54:43.408 --> 54:46.745
Stee, congratulations! You're
moving on to the knockouts!

54:46.786 --> 54:48.913
Stee vs. Willie -- oh.

54:48.955 --> 54:50.623
That was rough.
I did not like that.

54:50.665 --> 54:52.042
How could this have been
any more difficult?

54:52.083 --> 54:53.626
John!

54:53.668 --> 54:56.421
They took some liberties with
the song that I really loved.

54:56.463 --> 54:58.048
I think Stee can go really far.

54:58.089 --> 54:59.758
Give it up for Willie Gomez
one more time,

54:59.799 --> 55:01.343
ladies and gentlemen!

55:01.384 --> 55:03.094
Willie really helped me
make this a great performance,

55:03.136 --> 55:06.681
and thank you so much to John
for just pouring into us.

55:06.723 --> 55:08.850
I'm nervous about
three-way knockouts,

55:08.892 --> 55:10.518
but I'm going to
rise to the occasion,

55:10.560 --> 55:12.270
I'll tell you that much.

55:12.312 --> 55:13.438
That was tough.

55:13.480 --> 55:14.773
That's arguably one of
the toughest calls

55:14.814 --> 55:15.940
anyone's had to make.
Yeah.

55:15.982 --> 55:17.150
They were
both perfect today.

55:17.192 --> 55:18.777
What was
the thought process, then?

55:18.818 --> 55:20.445
I just feel like Stee
is just such a great vocalist,

55:20.487 --> 55:21.654
and we're "The Voice."

55:21.696 --> 55:23.156
He deserved it
for that.
Yeah.

55:23.198 --> 55:25.408
I think that John made
the right choice by picking Stee

55:25.450 --> 55:28.036
because I think he's
so incredibly talented.

55:28.078 --> 55:29.287
John: Ay.
He's so good.

55:29.329 --> 55:31.748
Gwen: I just want to see
more from him.

55:32.832 --> 55:34.125
Gwen:
So here we go.

55:34.167 --> 55:36.252
We're going to do
Juliette against Kristen.

55:36.294 --> 55:37.796
What?

55:37.837 --> 55:40.340
They have completely
different tones of voice,

55:40.382 --> 55:43.468
but similarities in their
energy and their spirit.

55:43.510 --> 55:45.220
What a surprise!

55:45.261 --> 55:48.473
Juliette sang in Spanish,
and Kristen is country.

55:48.515 --> 55:49.849
She sang "Blown Away."

55:49.891 --> 55:51.476
That song is, like,
new country.
Exactly.

55:51.518 --> 55:53.061
So it's, like,
pop country.

55:53.103 --> 55:54.688
Our biggest challenge
is going to be finding a song

55:54.729 --> 55:56.147
for them to sing.

55:56.189 --> 55:58.149
Drum roll!

55:58.191 --> 55:59.859
Kelly: You will be singing...

55:59.901 --> 56:02.320
"That's the Way It Is"
by Céline Dion.

56:02.362 --> 56:04.531
Yes! Yes!

56:04.572 --> 56:07.200
Yes! I love Céline!

56:07.242 --> 56:08.326
Do you know it?

56:08.368 --> 56:09.911
Of course I know it!

56:09.953 --> 56:12.330
Kristen: This song was
one of the first songs,

56:12.372 --> 56:14.082
when I was a kid,
that my mom showed me,

56:14.124 --> 56:15.959
that she really
wanted me to sing.

56:16.001 --> 56:18.837
And so just adds
that little, extra

56:18.878 --> 56:20.588
dash of love
for the song for me.

56:20.630 --> 56:23.883
My mom has Crohn's disease
and Sjogren's disease.

56:23.925 --> 56:25.343
Nothing's going to
stop me.

56:25.385 --> 56:28.054
But she's
the strongest person I know,

56:28.096 --> 56:30.640
and she's never once
missed a performance.

56:30.682 --> 56:32.100
That's what
mamas do.

56:32.142 --> 56:33.935
She's been like this
my whole life. She's amazing.

56:33.977 --> 56:35.687
She doesn't waver
with her support

56:35.729 --> 56:37.313
in what I want to do.

56:37.355 --> 56:39.357
* Shatter every window
till it's all... *

56:39.399 --> 56:42.068
I remember when Season One aired
and I watched it with my mom,

56:42.110 --> 56:45.071
and now to be here at Season 24,
it feels like a dream,

56:45.113 --> 56:46.698
and I don't want to wake up.

56:46.740 --> 56:49.284
Reba is the queen, but I'm
going to fight her right now.

56:49.325 --> 56:51.202
I'm a country singer
at my core.

56:51.244 --> 56:53.329
I got to go with Gwen.
What?

56:53.371 --> 56:55.415
But I felt something
in my gut in that moment

56:55.457 --> 56:57.375
say, "Go with Gwen."

56:57.417 --> 56:58.668
Hello.
Hi!

56:58.710 --> 56:59.878
How are you?
Good.

56:59.919 --> 57:02.380
How are you?
Good, how are you?

57:02.422 --> 57:05.050
Kristen: Gwen is an icon.
I'm so excited to work with her.

57:05.091 --> 57:07.469
The woman knows
how to command a stage.

57:07.510 --> 57:09.554
You guys, we're on
"The Voice" right now.

57:09.596 --> 57:10.722
I know.
That's crazy.

57:10.764 --> 57:12.057
All of America
is watching us.

57:12.098 --> 57:13.350
Wow.
It's crazy.

57:13.391 --> 57:14.768
You guys were amazing.
Thank you.

57:14.809 --> 57:15.894
I can't believe I got you
on my team.

57:15.935 --> 57:17.228
I'm so lucky.

57:17.270 --> 57:19.272
Well,
we're lucky to be here.
Oh, my gosh.

57:19.314 --> 57:21.274
What you did at the blinds
was so creative.

57:21.316 --> 57:23.568
Thank you. I felt like it was
the perfect combination of,

57:23.610 --> 57:27.030
like, what I love to do,
which is theater and my culture.

57:27.072 --> 57:29.699
* La bella historia que viví *

57:29.741 --> 57:33.036
* Hoy sigo enamorada de ti *

57:33.078 --> 57:34.829
Juliette: I'm living
my dreams right now.

57:34.871 --> 57:38.667
I got three chair turns,
which is crazy.

57:38.708 --> 57:40.210
Hello, Juliette.
Hi, Niall.

57:40.251 --> 57:41.628
Nooo!

57:41.670 --> 57:44.005
If you don't pick me,
it's gonna be a huge mistake.

57:44.047 --> 57:45.507
And we're --
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

57:45.548 --> 57:48.760
Juliette: Gwen, she seemed
so passionate and so sure

57:48.802 --> 57:50.720
that she was the right choice.

57:50.762 --> 57:52.263
How could I not go with her?

57:52.305 --> 57:55.975
Gwen: I feel like you both
are such great dramatic singers,

57:56.017 --> 57:58.144
and this is our moment together.

57:58.186 --> 57:59.688
Anything I can do
to help you guys --

57:59.729 --> 58:01.898
like, this is my favorite part
about the show right now.

58:01.940 --> 58:03.400
Awesome.

58:03.441 --> 58:04.734
* Yeahhh *

58:04.776 --> 58:06.861
Céline Dion, that's huge,
gigantic shoes to fill.

58:06.903 --> 58:09.280
* I can read
your mind *

58:09.322 --> 58:12.200
But I feel like this song
is perfect for both of them

58:12.242 --> 58:15.412
because it has this sort of
pop structure to it,

58:15.453 --> 58:19.124
but it also has this
storytelling country lyric,

58:19.165 --> 58:22.002
and it kind of transcends genre.

58:22.043 --> 58:24.254
* 'Cause you can win *

58:24.295 --> 58:26.131
I really like Juliette's tone.

58:26.172 --> 58:28.466
She has her own signature

58:28.508 --> 58:30.468
kind of style
to the way that she sings.

58:30.510 --> 58:33.263
Together:
* When you want it the most,
there's no easy... *

58:33.304 --> 58:36.808
Kristen has a really cool
country sort of twang...

58:36.850 --> 58:38.935
* That's
the way it is *

58:38.977 --> 58:40.186
...and has a lot
of stage presence

58:40.228 --> 58:41.938
and really has, like,
a sparkle to her.

58:41.980 --> 58:47.318
* And that's the way it is *

58:47.360 --> 58:48.236
Yeah!

58:48.278 --> 58:49.904
That was so good!
Thank you!

58:49.946 --> 58:52.323
Oh, my gosh, I love your, like,
yodels and your twangs,

58:52.365 --> 58:55.160
and then you,
your tone is so pretty.

58:55.201 --> 58:57.787
But do you feel like,
during that take,

58:57.829 --> 58:58.997
that you were
a little nervous?

58:59.039 --> 59:00.457
Very. [ Laughs ]

59:00.498 --> 59:03.043
Whatever that is, like,
get rid of it right away.

59:03.084 --> 59:04.961
A lot of this
has to do with confidence

59:05.003 --> 59:06.254
and believing in yourself.

59:06.296 --> 59:08.131
I just had this happen
to me in Vegas.

59:08.173 --> 59:10.300
All of a sudden,
I just -- I got so nervous,

59:10.342 --> 59:11.509
and I was like...
[ Gasps ]

59:11.551 --> 59:13.303
But I just try to, like,
fake myself

59:13.345 --> 59:16.014
into believing I'm the
all-powerful, like, confident,

59:16.056 --> 59:17.515
like, "Are you ready for this?"

59:17.557 --> 59:19.184
And then all of a sudden,
I get up there, and I'm like,

59:19.225 --> 59:21.770
"Oh. Oh, yeah, I know this game.
Here we go, guys."

59:21.811 --> 59:23.104
In rehearsal with Gwen,

59:23.146 --> 59:24.647
it was more nerve-wracking
than blinds.

59:24.689 --> 59:26.608
I see all these cameras,
and I'm like, "This is real.

59:26.649 --> 59:28.151
She's really
coaching me right now,"

59:28.193 --> 59:29.819
hence why I was
so in my head about it.

59:29.861 --> 59:31.029
Look at the sign!

59:31.071 --> 59:32.364
I was going to school

59:32.405 --> 59:34.324
at Boston Conservatory,
at Berklee,

59:34.366 --> 59:36.868
auditioning, working,
being a full-time student,

59:36.910 --> 59:39.037
doing this,
just without cameras.

59:39.079 --> 59:41.039
Your voice is gorgeous.

59:41.081 --> 59:42.499
You have so much to offer.

59:42.540 --> 59:44.793
Just, like...
[ Inhales, exhales ]

59:44.834 --> 59:45.835
...breathe it out.

59:45.877 --> 59:46.878
[ Exhales sharply ]
Okay.

59:46.920 --> 59:48.171
Maybe even running man.

59:48.213 --> 59:50.215
If Gwen believes in me,
I should, too.

59:50.256 --> 59:52.717
For you,
your performance style

59:52.759 --> 59:54.135
is quite princess-y.

59:54.177 --> 59:55.720
There could be
a cooler lane for you,

59:55.762 --> 59:56.930
a little more edgy.

59:56.971 --> 59:58.390
Take it back, like,

59:58.431 --> 01:00:00.100
to a little bit cooler
country place...
Yeah.

01:00:00.141 --> 01:00:02.394
...to kind of balance the song
out a little bit, right?

01:00:02.435 --> 01:00:04.354
Sure.
Oh, yeah, totally.
It shouldn't be like...

01:00:04.396 --> 01:00:06.815
Yeah.
[ Composed ] * Don't
give up on your faith *

01:00:06.856 --> 01:00:08.024
No, it needs to be...

01:00:08.066 --> 01:00:10.527
* Don't give up on your faith *

01:00:10.568 --> 01:00:13.196
[ Singing melody ]
* You're hopeful *

01:00:13.238 --> 01:00:14.489
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.

01:00:14.531 --> 01:00:16.116
It's facial expressions
that bring people

01:00:16.157 --> 01:00:17.826
into what
you're really thinking.

01:00:17.867 --> 01:00:20.161
I mean, even if you just filmed
yourself and watched it back,

01:00:20.203 --> 01:00:21.746
and you're like, "Okay,
that looks stupid."

01:00:21.788 --> 01:00:23.581
Or, "I actually believe
myself right there.

01:00:23.623 --> 01:00:25.917
Like, I didn't know I looked
like that when I sang that."

01:00:25.959 --> 01:00:27.585
Gwen has been phenomenal.

01:00:27.627 --> 01:00:29.254
* When you want it
the most *

01:00:29.295 --> 01:00:31.423
It's really fun
to be able to play around

01:00:31.464 --> 01:00:33.633
and have that
one-on-one help with her.

01:00:33.675 --> 01:00:35.051
* Ready to go *

01:00:35.093 --> 01:00:36.386
Leading into battles,
if you hear this song

01:00:36.428 --> 01:00:37.762
somewhere off in the distance,

01:00:37.804 --> 01:00:40.306
it's likely me rehearsing
until I go to sleep.

01:00:40.348 --> 01:00:42.350
I really want to dive
more into that lyric,

01:00:42.392 --> 01:00:44.602
make it as honest
and as personal as possible.

01:00:44.644 --> 01:00:47.063
I just --
I'm not ready to go home yet.

01:00:47.105 --> 01:00:49.607
Way better.
It sounds so good!

01:00:49.649 --> 01:00:50.692
Oh, my God.

01:00:50.734 --> 01:00:52.944
I think it's
really, really come far

01:00:52.986 --> 01:00:54.237
in just a short amount of time.

01:00:54.279 --> 01:00:56.114
It's so fun.
I love watching it happen.

01:00:56.156 --> 01:00:57.532
For Kristen and Juliette,

01:00:57.574 --> 01:00:59.951
I think it's going
to come down to confidence

01:00:59.993 --> 01:01:03.288
and being able to
take a Céline Dion song

01:01:03.329 --> 01:01:04.622
and make it their own.

01:01:04.664 --> 01:01:05.665
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:01:05.707 --> 01:01:07.167
Have fun, you guys.
Alright.
Bye!

01:01:07.208 --> 01:01:08.418
I'll see you.
See you soon.

01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:10.962
I'll see you at the battles.
Hello.

01:01:11.004 --> 01:01:12.547
It's going to be
a really hard decision.

01:01:12.589 --> 01:01:14.883
And don't be mad at me.
I have to pick somebody.

01:01:14.924 --> 01:01:16.801
Aww!
Okay!

01:01:16.843 --> 01:01:19.637
Daly: Still to come,
more great performances...

01:01:19.679 --> 01:01:23.308
* When you're ready to go,
and your heart's left in doubt *

01:01:23.350 --> 01:01:26.227
Daly: ...and a battle
that knocks Reba off her feet.

01:01:26.269 --> 01:01:28.271
* For good *

01:01:28.313 --> 01:01:30.065
Producer: Oh, my God.
You killed Reba.

01:01:30.106 --> 01:01:33.693
Together:
* I got a new attitude *

01:01:33.735 --> 01:01:37.155

I willingly sacrificed

pretty much everything
for my career --

not having the kids.

I have the little nieces.

a taste of what it is --

prepared for her, you know?

who I was as an artist,

That looked like a lot of fun
to be involved in,

had a good time, too.

01:17:54.299 --> 01:17:56.092

CORii, why did I not turn?

01:18:02.515 --> 01:18:04.392
The minute you opened
your mouth, I was like,

01:18:04.434 --> 01:18:07.270
"So why did I face the wall
for two minutes?"

01:18:07.312 --> 01:18:09.105
To be honest,
I do remember, like,

01:18:09.147 --> 01:18:10.857
pitch issues
in the blind auditions,

01:18:10.899 --> 01:18:12.275

you were the last time.

That could have
been your song.

Thank you.

I know how much of a fan
Reba is of both of you.

01:18:24.204 --> 01:18:25.789
I just think, if it was me,

01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:27.957
just knowing how
this competition goes

01:18:27.999 --> 01:18:29.417
and going through the weeks,

01:18:29.459 --> 01:18:32.253
the growth between
your blind audition and now

01:18:32.295 --> 01:18:34.297
made you stand out to me
in this one, CORii.

Thank you so much.

01:18:38.009 --> 01:18:41.763
Ms. Monét, I'm so literally
blown away by you.

I was like, okay, like,
she is just literally slaying.

01:18:48.561 --> 01:18:52.148
But then, CORii,
you started to somehow,

01:18:52.190 --> 01:18:54.192
like, lock into your voice.

01:18:54.234 --> 01:18:56.778
It was like, "Wow,
she has range and power."

01:18:56.820 --> 01:18:58.613
It just kept getting better
and better and better.

01:18:58.655 --> 01:19:01.700

is stressed about this.
I am.

CORii,
it felt like you were

01:19:14.379 --> 01:19:15.755
finding your footing
at the beginning.

01:19:15.797 --> 01:19:19.509
That was the only moment
where there was some clarity

01:19:19.551 --> 01:19:21.720
about who might be better
than the other person.

01:19:21.761 --> 01:19:23.346
But once
you kicked it in,

CORii, your voice
was magnificent.

01:19:25.724 --> 01:19:27.934
I loved the, like,
power in your voice

01:19:27.976 --> 01:19:29.978
and how it kind of shreds
and cuts through.

01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:31.354
And then, Ms. Monét,

01:19:31.396 --> 01:19:33.523

you were consistently amazing.

on that battle first.

with such confidence.

respect you totally,

with your stage presence
