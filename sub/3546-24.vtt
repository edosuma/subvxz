00:01.102 --> 00:02.109
Previously on...

00:02.133 --> 00:04.116
This will sweep her
right off her feet.

00:04.140 --> 00:08.185
You dog. You're gonna ask Susan to
marry you, aren't you? I didn't say that.

00:08.209 --> 00:10.617
They say money can't buy love...

00:10.641 --> 00:13.990
My gift to you.
You bought us a house?

00:14.014 --> 00:17.328
Or even happiness. I have another child,
Lynette.

00:17.352 --> 00:22.169
I only just found out about it. I am not having
an affair. And it certainly can't ease...

00:22.193 --> 00:25.010
You don't want to have sex
with me? Don't take it personally.

00:25.034 --> 00:26.573
A guilty conscience.

00:26.597 --> 00:29.406
See, that's why I can't give you
the keys to the kingdom, kid.

00:29.430 --> 00:31.030
No balls.

00:34.365 --> 00:37.644
Do I know you? Orson
hodge. Susan's dentist friend.

00:37.668 --> 00:40.087
The only thing that can bring
true peace of mind...

00:40.111 --> 00:43.120
You by any chance
recognize the jacket?

00:43.144 --> 00:45.197
That jacket belongs
to my other son.

00:45.221 --> 00:46.493
Is admitting the truth...

00:46.517 --> 00:50.497
We have to find them,
Bree, and get Danielle back.

00:50.521 --> 00:52.059
And setting yourself free.

00:52.083 --> 00:53.700
I am trying to leave
and these morons...

00:53.724 --> 00:56.234
Ow! Let go of me!
Bree, please don't struggle.

01:00.191 --> 01:08.191
â™ªâ™ªâ™ª

01:48.209 --> 01:50.117
Have they rung up
your prescription yet?

01:50.141 --> 01:52.119
No, they're getting it
right now.

01:52.143 --> 01:53.420
Good. Add that on.

01:53.444 --> 01:56.131
You're dying your hair
honey wheat blond?

01:56.155 --> 01:58.265
Oh, it's not for me.

01:58.289 --> 02:01.228
It's for Danielle.

02:01.252 --> 02:04.476
That hair is going back
to the color god intended.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.733
You actually think
she's gonna sit still

02:06.757 --> 02:08.735
as you towel this
through her hair?

02:08.758 --> 02:11.238
Oh, I will tie her down
if necessary.

02:11.262 --> 02:13.840
I'm also thinking of checking
her body for piercings

02:13.864 --> 02:15.517
while I'm at it.
You're overreacting.

02:15.541 --> 02:17.544
She's just going through
a phase.

02:17.568 --> 02:19.546
That's what girls her age do.

02:19.570 --> 02:22.289
They also get pregnant
and become drug addicts.

02:22.313 --> 02:24.823
And that color hair
is the gateway.

02:26.417 --> 02:29.326
Would you please, uh,
add that to our bill?

02:29.350 --> 02:30.827
I'm telling you, Bree,

02:30.851 --> 02:32.859
you're gonna have to
stop riding 'em so hard.

02:32.883 --> 02:36.770
I am trying to ensure that they
turn into responsible adults.

02:36.794 --> 02:39.266
Trust me, Rex, in the end,

02:39.290 --> 02:41.238
we will be rewarded.

02:41.262 --> 02:43.840
How can you be so damn sure
of yourself all the time?

02:43.864 --> 02:45.772
Why is my certainty a flaw?

02:45.796 --> 02:48.275
I know what I'm about,
I know my values,

02:48.299 --> 02:50.146
and I know what's right.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.148
Why shouldn't I stay the course?

02:52.172 --> 02:54.521
Am I right, Mr. Williams?

02:54.545 --> 02:57.284
My mother always took
a firm hand with me,

02:57.308 --> 02:59.286
and I thank her for it.

02:59.310 --> 03:02.329
Exactly, and look how well
you turned out.

03:05.416 --> 03:08.635
Look, you're a good mother,
but there's a limit.

03:08.659 --> 03:11.338
You have got to relinquish
some control,

03:11.362 --> 03:13.362
or else you're gonna regret it.

03:31.242 --> 03:34.190
Excuse me. Do you have the time?

03:34.214 --> 03:37.401
Yeah, it's just after 8:00.
Oh, I was afraid of that.

03:37.425 --> 03:38.865
Afraid of what?

03:38.889 --> 03:41.868
Well, I'm only supposed
to be restrained until 7:00.

03:41.892 --> 03:44.236
You see, I have a problem
with sleepwalking.

03:44.260 --> 03:46.633
They just tie me up
so that I don't wander off

03:46.657 --> 03:48.335
and hurt myself.

03:48.359 --> 03:51.238
Yeah, well, I'm sure a nurse
will be in here soon.

03:51.262 --> 03:52.539
One can only hope.

03:52.563 --> 03:54.990
Of course, if a doctor
gets here first

03:55.014 --> 03:58.545
and sees that someone
forgot to release me,

03:58.569 --> 04:01.288
I'm sure they'd get
in a lot of trouble.

04:01.312 --> 04:03.920
Lady, I can't let you
out of your restraints.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.422
I'd get fired.

04:05.446 --> 04:08.376
Oh. Well, I certainly would not
want that to happen.

04:12.252 --> 04:13.730
What's your name?

04:13.754 --> 04:14.961
Alfred.

04:14.985 --> 04:16.903
Oh! Does anybody ever
call you "Alfie"?

04:16.927 --> 04:18.505
No.

04:18.529 --> 04:21.889
And why should they?

04:24.365 --> 04:26.242
So, um, Alfred,

04:26.266 --> 04:29.776
I was wondering if you could
maybe loosen my restraints.

04:29.800 --> 04:31.578
They're incredibly tight,

04:31.602 --> 04:34.281
and I'm sure there are no rules

04:34.305 --> 04:36.305
against making me
more comfortable.

04:41.051 --> 04:43.590
Do you think I'm stupid?

04:43.614 --> 04:45.332
I beg your pardon?

04:45.356 --> 04:47.834
Two seconds after I loosen
these little restraints,

04:47.858 --> 04:49.936
you'll try to scratch
my eyes out

04:49.960 --> 04:51.668
and make a run for it.

04:51.692 --> 04:54.446
Well, I'm not falling for it,
you psycho little bitch.

04:54.470 --> 04:56.873
In fact, I hope they keep you
tied up for the next month.

04:56.897 --> 04:59.376
'Cause I'd get a real kick
out of watching

04:59.400 --> 05:01.448
a prissy little whack job
like you

05:01.472 --> 05:03.450
lying in your own filth.

05:03.474 --> 05:04.984
Know what I mean?

05:22.423 --> 05:23.900
Careful with those.

05:23.924 --> 05:26.573
The last of the crystal. Okay.

05:26.597 --> 05:28.805
Hey, what's going on?

05:28.829 --> 05:31.438
Oh, hi. Um, we're just moving.

05:31.462 --> 05:33.480
Hey! It's the plumber.

05:33.504 --> 05:36.821
You come over to help susie
move into her new house?

05:36.845 --> 05:38.385
New house?

05:38.409 --> 05:41.448
Oh, she didn't tell you?
I bought a place for my girls.

05:41.472 --> 05:43.450
You let him buy you a house?

05:43.474 --> 05:45.397
Uh, well,
he's not moving in with us.

05:45.421 --> 05:47.854
After that speech about
wanting to go it alone,

05:47.878 --> 05:50.797
and after I offered
to let you stay with me?

05:50.821 --> 05:53.500
To be fair,
you just had a spare room,

05:53.524 --> 05:55.037
and this is a whole house.

05:55.061 --> 05:56.533
Hey, no offense,

05:56.557 --> 05:59.666
if you're not using your back,
you're just in the way.

05:59.690 --> 06:02.038
You saw me buying that ring,

06:02.062 --> 06:04.371
and you just had to cut me off.

06:04.395 --> 06:06.413
You bought me a ring?

06:06.437 --> 06:08.375
Suze, let me handle this.

06:08.399 --> 06:10.617
A man's gotta protect
his family.

06:10.641 --> 06:13.450
Uh, Mike, about that ring...
Put that box down.

06:13.474 --> 06:16.423
What, you gonna hit me, huh?

06:16.447 --> 06:18.084
Stop it! Oh, my...

06:19.550 --> 06:22.389
What are you...
Just stop it! Oh, that's enough!

06:22.413 --> 06:26.763
Just get off! Get off! Go! Go!
Oh, my god.

06:26.787 --> 06:29.996
What? Stop! That's enough.
Enough, enough. Back up.

06:30.020 --> 06:34.401
And that ring... that was for me,
right? Not now.

06:34.425 --> 06:36.473
Oh, my...

06:36.497 --> 06:37.804
Ohh!

06:37.828 --> 06:40.977
Karl, are you okay?

06:41.001 --> 06:43.379
Are you okay? Let me see.

06:43.403 --> 06:45.583
Oh, my god.

06:47.578 --> 06:49.456
Whew.

06:49.480 --> 06:51.980
Can you sit up?

06:57.518 --> 06:59.518
Whew.

07:02.453 --> 07:05.031
Xiao-Mei, do you have a second?

07:05.055 --> 07:08.034
This is probably silly,
but it's been bothering me.

07:08.058 --> 07:10.477
When you said,
"please don't kill him,"

07:10.501 --> 07:11.778
did you mean Carlos?

07:11.802 --> 07:15.542
Ralph dead, not Mr. Solis.

07:15.566 --> 07:19.415
I know. It's just,
you said "kill," not "dead."

07:19.439 --> 07:22.589
And I'd have to do be
pretty angry to kill someone,

07:22.613 --> 07:24.591
so I guess my question is,

07:24.615 --> 07:27.545
do I have a reason
to be angry at Mr. Solis?

07:29.780 --> 07:32.550
Please, so much laundry.

07:36.627 --> 07:37.927
Xiao-Mei...

07:39.760 --> 07:42.930
How did you rip your panties?

07:47.498 --> 07:49.838
I fall down.

07:56.246 --> 08:00.026
Mr. Young, you'll need
to come up to the house

08:00.050 --> 08:02.088
to sign some legal documents.

08:02.112 --> 08:03.630
What for?

08:03.654 --> 08:05.997
Noah Taylor's will called
for an immediate transference

08:06.021 --> 08:08.686
of his entire estate to you
upon his death.

08:12.763 --> 08:14.741
So everything's mine?

08:14.765 --> 08:16.503
That's correct.

08:23.103 --> 08:24.611
Hi, dad.

08:24.635 --> 08:27.614
So, did you have
any luck with your grandfather?

08:27.638 --> 08:29.616
Yeah, I talked to Noah.

08:29.640 --> 08:31.618
He's not gonna give us
the money.

08:31.642 --> 08:32.919
Damn it, Zach! Sorry?

08:32.943 --> 08:34.921
Go back and talk to him.

08:34.945 --> 08:37.624
No, I-I don't think
he's gonna change his mind.

08:37.648 --> 08:39.626
Terrific.
Am I gonna see you tomorrow?

08:39.650 --> 08:41.628
No, I-I can't come tomorrow.

08:41.652 --> 08:42.929
What about Monday?

08:42.953 --> 08:44.936
Uh, next week's bad for me, too.

08:44.960 --> 08:47.503
I'll... I'll call you when
I know. Zach? Zach!

08:47.527 --> 08:49.836
Is there anything I can do?

08:49.860 --> 08:53.630
Yeah, get me a new phone
with a different number.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.806
And fill in this stupid lake.

09:08.679 --> 09:10.657
Oh. Are you all right?

09:10.681 --> 09:14.831
Uh, yeah. A little hopped up
on pain medicine, but, um,

09:14.855 --> 09:17.533
I chipped my tooth
on the salad shooter.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.535
Oh. Oh, you know,
you should, um,

09:19.559 --> 09:21.708
call my friend Orson.

09:21.732 --> 09:23.009
He's a dentist.

09:23.033 --> 09:25.972
I'm sure he'll see you
right away. Thanks.

09:25.996 --> 09:28.144
So...

09:28.168 --> 09:30.817
About that ring you bought...

09:30.841 --> 09:34.581
Is there anything particular
you'd like to ask me?

09:34.605 --> 09:36.753
Nope, not as long Karl's got you

09:36.777 --> 09:38.254
wrapped around his finger.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.926
Okay, that's ridiculous.

09:39.950 --> 09:42.288
Karl doesn't have me
wrapped around anything.

09:42.312 --> 09:45.696
You accepted a house from him,
and you're nuts if you believe

09:45.720 --> 09:47.694
he doesn't have
an ulterior motive.

09:47.718 --> 09:49.696
He's Karl. He's playing me.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.998
But that house is gonna be
a great place

09:52.022 --> 09:54.741
for my daughter to live.

09:54.765 --> 09:56.743
And when he makes his move,

09:56.767 --> 10:00.677
he's gonna realize that
iwas really playinghim.

10:00.701 --> 10:04.150
So... about that ring...

10:04.174 --> 10:06.618
I... I just don't want
to get deeper into this

10:06.642 --> 10:09.115
and suddenly realize
your heart's somewhere else.

10:09.139 --> 10:13.860
Mike, my heart is
in the exact right place.

10:13.884 --> 10:16.171
Ugh. I can't have
this conversation.

10:16.195 --> 10:18.725
Now my tooth is throbbing.

10:18.749 --> 10:21.227
Of course.

10:21.251 --> 10:22.751
Okay.

10:24.755 --> 10:27.955
You don't even wanna know
what my answer would have been?

10:37.768 --> 10:39.746
Can we please get out of here?

10:39.770 --> 10:41.047
This place is gross.

10:41.071 --> 10:43.019
And, god, I'm starving.

10:43.043 --> 10:45.657
Yeah, I know, but we don't
have any money, remember?

10:45.681 --> 10:47.654
That's why we should
go to my house.

10:47.678 --> 10:49.696
I know the combination
to my mom's safe.

10:49.720 --> 10:51.698
Okay, I've told you
a thousand times,

10:51.722 --> 10:54.000
it's way too risky. No. Something
you should know before we embark

10:54.024 --> 10:55.707
on this little adventure...

10:55.731 --> 10:58.004
I can get pretty bitchy
when I'm not fed.

11:04.294 --> 11:06.647
Listen, I hope
I'm not out of line here,

11:06.671 --> 11:09.275
but did you ever spend
any time in prison?

11:09.299 --> 11:12.078
What, you can tell
from my teeth?

11:12.102 --> 11:15.922
Jailhouse dentistry...
Unmistakable and not pretty.

11:15.946 --> 11:18.925
Yeah, I did a little time
in Kansas a few years back.

11:18.949 --> 11:20.927
Were you a prison dentist?

11:20.951 --> 11:24.691
Uh, during dental school,
we did freebie work

11:24.715 --> 11:27.834
on some of the poor Guinea pigs
behind bars. No offense.

11:27.858 --> 11:30.837
You know, I had the feeling
when I first saw you

11:30.861 --> 11:33.700
in the movie theater that we'd
met before. I don't think so.

11:33.724 --> 11:36.007
Oh, I'm pretty sure.
I think I know you.

11:36.031 --> 11:38.805
Any chance I was
one of your Guinea pigs?

11:38.829 --> 11:42.469
No. The only prison work
I did was back in Virginia.

11:45.405 --> 11:47.954
Diploma says you graduated
from Minnesota.

11:47.978 --> 11:51.888
I'm licensed in three states.

11:51.912 --> 11:54.460
Open wide, please.

11:54.484 --> 11:57.894
Don't talk.
I wouldn't want to hurt you.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.739
Carlos, you promised
you'd come home today.

12:12.763 --> 12:15.046
Well, I don't care
what Tanaka wants!

12:15.070 --> 12:17.744
Rattling around
this stupid house all by myself

12:17.768 --> 12:19.746
is not what I signed up for!

12:19.770 --> 12:23.310
No, no, no, don't hang up on me.
I'm not done yelling at you!

12:48.368 --> 12:51.017
Mrs. Solis.

12:51.041 --> 12:52.518
How are you?

12:52.542 --> 12:55.481
The best you've ever had.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.235
What's so funny?

13:09.259 --> 13:11.938
Me and my friend Justin
had this bet.

13:11.962 --> 13:13.940
See who could lose
their virginity first

13:13.964 --> 13:15.942
this summer at Bible camp.

13:15.966 --> 13:18.196
Guess I beat him to the punch.

13:19.930 --> 13:21.407
You were a virgin?

13:21.431 --> 13:23.950
So it didn't show?

13:23.974 --> 13:25.511
Uh, no.

13:25.535 --> 13:28.014
No, I mean, I guess it was,
well, weird when

13:28.038 --> 13:31.257
you started naming the American
presidents in order.

13:31.281 --> 13:33.359
Yeah, I wish you hadn't
heard that.

13:33.383 --> 13:35.361
I was just trying to...

13:35.385 --> 13:38.024
No, no, you were good.

13:39.890 --> 13:42.899
Just, if it comes up in school,
Paul revere was never president.

13:42.923 --> 13:46.572
Oh. Thanks.

13:46.596 --> 13:50.536
I, uh, had a really
awesome time, Mrs. Solis.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.378
Well, good. I'm glad,

13:52.402 --> 13:54.810
because this can
never happen again.

13:54.834 --> 13:55.811
Why?

13:55.835 --> 13:57.413
The only reason I did this

13:57.437 --> 13:59.585
was because I was angry
at Carlos.

13:59.609 --> 14:02.348
Now, thanks to you,
I'm not angry anymore.

14:02.372 --> 14:05.026
Well, you should be.
I mean, the guy's never around.

14:05.050 --> 14:07.894
Hell, he's probably off having
his own affair right now.

14:07.918 --> 14:10.897
Oh. I seriously doubt that.

14:10.921 --> 14:12.899
How do you know?

14:12.923 --> 14:15.907
Because Carlos doesn't have
an adulterous bone in his body.

14:15.931 --> 14:17.904
What we just did
he could never do.

14:17.928 --> 14:23.309
For him, sex isn't just sex.
It's a sign of intimacy.

14:23.333 --> 14:26.442
It's the way he shows love.

14:26.466 --> 14:30.076
You know, instead of
talking and listening

14:30.100 --> 14:32.870
and spending time with me.

14:36.907 --> 14:39.055
What was that for?

14:39.079 --> 14:42.049
Thought you needed a kiss.

14:44.314 --> 14:47.233
Well, since this is
our last time,

14:47.257 --> 14:49.936
I guess we can make
the most of it.

14:55.625 --> 14:59.976
So... you really trust him, huh?

15:00.000 --> 15:01.370
Completely.

15:03.103 --> 15:05.151
Like all good mothers,

15:05.175 --> 15:10.957
Gabrielle had purchased several
top-of-the-line baby monitors.

15:10.981 --> 15:13.889
She had planned to use them
to keep a close watch

15:13.913 --> 15:16.522
on her newborn child.

15:16.546 --> 15:21.086
That plan was about to change.

15:27.097 --> 15:29.075
So I'm gonna go shopping

15:29.099 --> 15:31.077
and then I'm gonna see
my trainer,

15:31.101 --> 15:33.361
and I'll definitely be gone
for, like, three hours.

15:36.606 --> 15:39.506
Okay. Well, I gotta go.
Have fun.

15:48.218 --> 15:49.695
Not later, penny.

15:49.719 --> 15:52.349
Mommy's gotta change you now
'cause you stink.

15:56.686 --> 15:59.505
Here, taste this.

15:59.529 --> 16:01.237
Oh, man!

16:01.261 --> 16:03.139
Xiao-Mei, that is amazing.

16:03.163 --> 16:04.470
You like?

16:04.494 --> 16:07.113
Oh, yeah.
Sorry if I'm making a mess.

16:07.137 --> 16:11.577
It's okay. Mu shu pork
supposed to be messy.

16:11.601 --> 16:13.579
I wish Gabrielle could
cook like this.

16:13.603 --> 16:15.590
Have you ever tried
her enchiladas?

16:15.614 --> 16:18.985
One time. They make me sick.

16:24.554 --> 16:27.493
Mike still hasn't seen
the invitation.

16:27.517 --> 16:29.535
Ugh. He will, and he'll meet you

16:29.559 --> 16:31.998
for a romantic
motor home rendezvous,

16:32.022 --> 16:34.000
and you'll propose,
he'll accept,

16:34.024 --> 16:36.507
and you'll both live
happily ever after.

16:36.531 --> 16:39.145
You really think
that's what's gonna happen?

16:39.169 --> 16:41.007
It's my deepest hope.

16:41.031 --> 16:43.331
Oh, there he is.

17:07.426 --> 17:09.396
We're in.

17:17.666 --> 17:19.645
Polly? That's a good name.

17:19.669 --> 17:21.186
No way.

17:21.211 --> 17:22.188
Pamela.

17:22.212 --> 17:24.190
I said I wanted penny.

17:24.214 --> 17:25.191
Oh, Lynette...

17:25.214 --> 17:28.094
Eight hours of grueling labor.

17:28.117 --> 17:29.395
That's not fair.

17:29.419 --> 17:32.098
Neither are stretch marks,
but what are you gonna do?

17:32.122 --> 17:35.131
I've only known one penny
in my whole life,

17:35.155 --> 17:37.203
and she was a slut.
Isn't your aunt named penny?

17:37.227 --> 17:39.065
Yeah, that's her.

17:39.089 --> 17:42.408
Our daughter
is officially named.

17:42.432 --> 17:44.110
You may go now.

17:44.134 --> 17:46.621
All right,
I'll let you win this one,

17:46.645 --> 17:49.115
but I get to name the next one.

17:49.139 --> 17:52.218
You promised me
we'd stop at four.

17:52.242 --> 17:54.220
Remember? You wanted four kids,

17:54.244 --> 17:57.783
I wanted one, and somehow
we compromised on four.

17:57.807 --> 18:00.055
Can we please stop now?

18:00.079 --> 18:01.527
Lynette, you're hurting me.

18:01.551 --> 18:04.360
I will stop
as soon as you promise.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.662
Okay, I promise.

18:06.686 --> 18:09.295
Okay.

18:11.361 --> 18:13.799
Honey, I...
I didn't mean to upset ya.

18:13.823 --> 18:16.642
It's just...
We've been so happy.

18:16.666 --> 18:18.644
Sweetie, sometimes when
you're at work,

18:18.668 --> 18:21.147
and I'm home alone
with three young boys,

18:21.171 --> 18:23.179
I'm not so happy,

18:23.203 --> 18:26.212
and now I'm gonna be alone
with four kids.

18:26.236 --> 18:28.784
Each one is a blessing, yes,

18:28.808 --> 18:32.118
but I don't think
I can take any more...

18:32.142 --> 18:33.589
Blessings.

18:33.613 --> 18:37.163
More blessings
could make me lose my mind.

18:37.187 --> 18:39.125
Do you understand?

18:39.149 --> 18:40.326
Yeah.

18:40.350 --> 18:42.668
Thank you.

18:44.594 --> 18:47.133
Honey, that really hurt.

18:47.157 --> 18:49.205
Did it hurt for eight hours?

18:49.229 --> 18:50.776
No.

18:50.800 --> 18:52.530
Okay, then.

18:59.309 --> 19:01.647
I must have been crazy,
agreeing to this.

19:01.671 --> 19:03.649
Honey, you're gonna feel
differently

19:03.673 --> 19:05.151
once you meet Kayla.

19:05.175 --> 19:07.153
She is a sweet,
smart little girl,

19:07.177 --> 19:10.156
plus it'll help you get past
your resentment of Nora.

19:10.180 --> 19:11.197
I don't...

19:11.221 --> 19:13.281
Well, here goes.

19:17.527 --> 19:19.157
Hey, you!

19:32.302 --> 19:35.181
You must be Lynette.
And you must be Nora.

19:35.205 --> 19:37.183
I guess it'd be weird
if we hugged.

19:37.207 --> 19:39.555
Probably.

19:39.579 --> 19:41.687
Wh-where's Kayla?

19:41.711 --> 19:43.158
Oh, she didn't come.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.736
We got into this huge fight,
and I was, like...

19:45.760 --> 19:48.194
I just couldn't stand
to look at her face

19:48.218 --> 19:51.197
on that long plane trip, so I
dumped her at the neighbors'.

19:51.221 --> 19:53.321
But, hey, come on, you got me.

20:02.702 --> 20:05.281
So, anyway,
Kayla is doing great.

20:05.305 --> 20:07.753
She's so pretty. She's so smart.

20:07.777 --> 20:10.856
She's practically a star
on her soccer team.

20:10.880 --> 20:12.918
I have the cutest picture.

20:12.942 --> 20:14.920
You know,
we wouldn't need a picture

20:14.944 --> 20:17.954
if you had actually
brought her like you promised.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.327
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

20:21.351 --> 20:23.829
You know, but I just
haven't had much time

20:23.853 --> 20:26.537
to get away on my own since,
um, I've been taking care

20:26.561 --> 20:29.235
of your kid for
the past 11 years, super dad.

20:29.259 --> 20:31.237
Okay, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry.

20:31.261 --> 20:34.380
I know it's been hard.
You've done an amazing job.

20:34.404 --> 20:37.288
Thank you. I think so, too.
Apology accepted.

20:37.312 --> 20:39.615
Anyway, I wasn't sure
that I wanted Kayla here

20:39.639 --> 20:41.669
if we were gonna talk
about business.

20:43.813 --> 20:45.220
Business?

20:45.244 --> 20:50.326
I was hoping that we could
talk about child support

20:50.350 --> 20:53.629
since I've got, like,
11 years coming to me, right?

20:53.653 --> 20:55.706
You never told me
I had a daughter.

20:55.730 --> 20:58.264
My lawyer thinks
that I have a very good case.

20:58.288 --> 21:00.836
We can't afford this.
We have four kids.

21:00.860 --> 21:03.939
Tom just lost his job.
That'd bankrupt us.

21:03.963 --> 21:06.447
I'm the bad guy now
when he's the one

21:06.471 --> 21:09.375
that knocked me up
and abandoned his child?

21:09.399 --> 21:12.618
How could he abandon her if
he didn't even know she existed?

21:12.642 --> 21:14.780
That doesn't let him
off the hook.

21:14.804 --> 21:17.558
You know, you better do right
by me unless, of course,

21:17.582 --> 21:19.555
you wanna be known
as Mrs. Deadbeat dad!

21:19.579 --> 21:21.649
Just take it easy.

21:25.655 --> 21:27.393
Are we just gonna keep
talking louder?

21:27.417 --> 21:28.734
Is that the plan?

21:28.758 --> 21:30.736
You wanna just keep
raising your voice

21:30.760 --> 21:32.868
'cause that's how you get
what you want, right?

21:32.892 --> 21:34.640
You make a scene,
you throw a tantrum,

21:34.664 --> 21:36.647
and everyone gets scared
and backs off.

21:36.671 --> 21:39.405
Well, I don't work that way,
lady. I don't care that

21:39.429 --> 21:40.706
my husband
was so phenomenally stupid

21:40.730 --> 21:42.508
and/or drunk to actually
have sex with you.

21:42.532 --> 21:44.980
I'm not gonna let it ruin
my life.

21:45.004 --> 21:46.991
Am I talking loud enough

21:47.015 --> 21:49.706
for that to get through to you?

21:53.483 --> 21:56.553
I'm just gonna pay the bill.

22:06.356 --> 22:08.334
Karl, we've been through
a lot together.

22:08.358 --> 22:10.336
We will always be connected
by Julie,

22:10.360 --> 22:12.338
but... I know why
you bought me that house,

22:12.362 --> 22:14.009
and I'm not moving into it.

22:14.033 --> 22:15.841
Susie, come on, I...

22:15.865 --> 22:17.783
Carl, we are not
getting back together.

22:17.807 --> 22:23.619
Not ever. You need to just stop
and realize that it's over.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.491
I'm gonna marry Mike.

22:25.515 --> 22:28.694
So I need you to sign these

22:28.718 --> 22:31.378
because I have to be
divorced first.

22:33.022 --> 22:34.630
Mike popped the question?

22:34.654 --> 22:37.441
No. He was going to, but then
you clocked him in the mouth

22:37.465 --> 22:39.765
with a salad shooter, remember?

22:39.789 --> 22:43.469
Actually, I'm going to pop
the question to him

22:43.493 --> 22:45.363
tomorrow night.

22:47.497 --> 22:49.415
Guess it cuts down
on the suspense

22:49.439 --> 22:51.417
knowing he bought you a ring.

22:51.441 --> 22:56.482
You would think so,
but, no, it doesn't.

22:56.506 --> 22:58.954
This is a lot to ask

22:58.978 --> 23:01.457
for a man
who still loves you, susie.

23:01.481 --> 23:03.889
I know.

23:03.913 --> 23:07.833
But if you really do... Love me,

23:07.857 --> 23:09.517
you'll let me go.

23:15.865 --> 23:18.425
Okay, susie. I can do that.

23:20.570 --> 23:23.549
Well, you know where to find me
if it doesn't work out.

23:23.573 --> 23:25.913
Oh, shut up.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.686
I don't see another way
to make this work.

23:30.710 --> 23:32.688
We've gotta dip
into the pensions.

23:32.712 --> 23:34.690
Oh, I don't like
the sound of that.

23:34.714 --> 23:36.927
Well, it's that
or the kids' college fund.

23:36.951 --> 23:38.994
We'll write Nora one big check,

23:39.018 --> 23:41.497
and in return,
she'll sign away her claim

23:41.521 --> 23:43.499
for the back child support.

23:43.523 --> 23:46.507
If we're lucky, she'll take
the bird in the hand.

23:46.531 --> 23:48.604
Okay, what are we
talking about? How much?

23:48.628 --> 23:52.007
Well, we need to show her
we're serious.

23:52.031 --> 23:53.579
$30,000?

23:53.603 --> 23:55.850
Are you kidding? $30,000?
If she takes you to court,

23:55.874 --> 23:57.843
we'll lose and end up paying

23:57.867 --> 23:59.845
11 years of child support
all at once.

23:59.869 --> 24:01.847
We could lose the house.

24:01.871 --> 24:05.011
Oh, we are screwed. We
are just plain screwed. Tom!

24:06.876 --> 24:09.855
I am trying very hard
to be strong right now,

24:09.879 --> 24:12.558
and you melting down
is not helping me.

24:12.582 --> 24:15.461
I'm sorry.

24:15.485 --> 24:18.464
I know we're using up
a huge chunk of our savings,

24:18.488 --> 24:21.607
but if it keeps that crazy woman
out of our life,

24:21.631 --> 24:24.169
it is the best money
we have ever spent.

24:24.193 --> 24:27.143
We will be okay.

24:28.598 --> 24:31.517
Hey there.

24:31.541 --> 24:34.119
I was surprised to hear
you wanted a session.

24:34.143 --> 24:36.630
Well, there's nothing like
being tied to a bed

24:36.654 --> 24:39.224
to change a girl's mind.

24:39.248 --> 24:42.087
What do you wanna talk about?

24:42.111 --> 24:43.589
Anything at all.

24:43.613 --> 24:47.693
As you said, I...
I have a lot of issues.

24:47.717 --> 24:49.635
Well, I assumed as much

24:49.659 --> 24:51.637
when you told
the ridiculous story

24:51.661 --> 24:54.540
about your daughter
running off with a murderer.

24:54.564 --> 24:57.042
Saw right through that, did ya?

24:57.066 --> 24:59.605
Well, I'm a trained
professional, Bree.

24:59.629 --> 25:03.649
The human mind is my playground.

25:03.673 --> 25:05.786
Well, I'm glad
that you're having fun.

25:05.810 --> 25:07.783
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be flip.

25:07.807 --> 25:11.617
But you came here
because you were troubled,

25:11.641 --> 25:15.490
and then you refuse
any help we give you.

25:15.514 --> 25:18.571
Things were falling apart
at home, and I just...

25:18.595 --> 25:22.197
I just needed a place
to rest, that's all.

25:22.221 --> 25:24.900
I think there's more to it
than that.

25:24.924 --> 25:25.901
Do you?

25:25.925 --> 25:28.233
I think it has to do
with your kids.

25:28.257 --> 25:31.677
You don't want to talk
about them.

25:31.701 --> 25:32.978
Why is that?

25:33.002 --> 25:37.543
Probably because I'm ashamed.

25:37.567 --> 25:39.514
Ashamed?

25:39.538 --> 25:41.516
My children were my life.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.919
They were the reason that
I got up in the morning,

25:43.943 --> 25:45.926
so to have failed them
as a parent...

25:45.950 --> 25:47.693
You think you failed them
as a parent?

25:47.717 --> 25:49.154
Well, my son is a sociopath,

25:49.178 --> 25:52.127
and my daughter hates me enough
to have run away from home.

25:52.151 --> 25:53.899
I'm certainly not gonna get

25:53.923 --> 25:57.207
"mother of the year" anytime soon.
If your kids were here right now,

25:57.231 --> 26:00.265
what would you tell them? I would
beg my son Andrew for forgiveness

26:00.289 --> 26:02.267
for having given up on him,

26:02.291 --> 26:04.770
and I would tell my daughter
not to worry,

26:04.794 --> 26:06.851
that I have a plan
to protect her.

26:06.875 --> 26:10.676
And just what is that plan?

26:56.245 --> 26:58.293
So I've got everything
ready to go...

26:58.317 --> 27:00.796
Flowers, candles,
Elvis costello cd all cued up.

27:00.820 --> 27:02.297
But who has the ring? He does.

27:02.321 --> 27:04.670
So, wait, you're gonna get
down on one knee,

27:04.694 --> 27:06.601
pop the question,
and while you're down there,

27:06.625 --> 27:08.603
dig in his pocket? What if
you pull out his key chain?

27:08.627 --> 27:11.737
Then I'm gonna have to find a
way to force it on my finger.

27:11.761 --> 27:13.779
Oh, xiao-Mei, where'd
you learn to kiss like that?

27:13.803 --> 27:15.741
Sorry,
that's penny's baby monitor.

27:15.765 --> 27:17.743
It's always picking up weird
frequencies. No, no, no! Don't turn it off.

27:17.767 --> 27:21.747
Ohh! Move over.
My knees hit the dashboard.

27:21.771 --> 27:25.651
I move seat back. Better?

27:25.675 --> 27:27.793
Oh, yeah.

28:07.116 --> 28:09.816
Are you done with my husband?

28:11.891 --> 28:13.391
Good.

28:16.726 --> 28:19.745
I have a little project for you.

28:19.769 --> 28:22.748
Okay, Gaby, can we please
talk about this?!

28:22.772 --> 28:25.716
You're the one that gave me
permission, remember?

28:25.740 --> 28:27.352
You said, "go have sex
with somebody"!

28:27.376 --> 28:29.084
To have meaningless sex, Carlos,

28:29.108 --> 28:31.787
not to sleep with the woman
who's carrying our child!

28:31.811 --> 28:33.919
What is the matter?!
Look, we're even!

28:33.943 --> 28:36.226
You had an affair,
and I had an affair!

28:36.250 --> 28:38.724
I had a reason to.
You were never here!

28:38.748 --> 28:40.265
I've been here, Carlos.

28:40.289 --> 28:43.198
I have tried so hard
to not be selfish

28:43.222 --> 28:45.200
and to put your needs
above mine.

28:45.224 --> 28:47.141
I mean, for god sakes,
look at me!

28:47.165 --> 28:49.775
I have agreed to be
a mother for you!

28:49.799 --> 28:52.107
Look, Gaby, you have
every right to be mad at me.

28:52.131 --> 28:54.980
So I'm gonna go
and check into a hotel room

28:55.004 --> 28:58.021
and let you cool down, but we
aregoing to work this out.

28:58.045 --> 29:00.737
Forget the hotel, Carlos.
Get a lease.

29:09.418 --> 29:11.356
I can go now, too?

29:11.380 --> 29:13.959
No, you can start dinner.

29:13.983 --> 29:15.060
What?!

29:15.084 --> 29:18.433
You're not going anywhere,

29:18.457 --> 29:21.757
not as long as you have
my baby in your belly.

29:28.497 --> 29:31.476
I don't know what that meant,
but I didn't like the tone.

29:31.500 --> 29:33.979
So just remember,
I am the boss of you,

29:34.003 --> 29:35.981
or else I'm gonna make this

29:36.005 --> 29:38.905
the worst nine months
of your life.

29:45.784 --> 29:47.432
Hi. Hi.

29:47.456 --> 29:49.935
Did you get the check?

29:49.959 --> 29:52.237
Yeah, I wanted to talk
to you about that.

29:52.261 --> 29:54.239
Do you have a minute?

29:54.263 --> 29:56.241
Tom?!

29:56.265 --> 29:58.243
I'm not the type of person

29:58.267 --> 30:01.947
that can keep things
bottled up inside.

30:01.971 --> 30:05.550
Really? So I'm just gonna
have to get this off my chest.

30:05.574 --> 30:08.061
You made me feel really bad
about myself

30:08.085 --> 30:10.355
yesterday at the restaurant.

30:10.379 --> 30:13.418
My sincerest apologies.

30:13.442 --> 30:15.926
You treated me
like some sort of mercenary,

30:15.950 --> 30:17.923
like the only reason I came here

30:17.947 --> 30:19.794
was to extort money from you.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.067
Well, to be honest,
first, we bought you pie,

30:22.091 --> 30:24.269
then you tried
to extort money from us.

30:24.293 --> 30:28.834
See? There it is again,
Lynette... that mean streak.

30:28.858 --> 30:30.876
All I want is what's best
for my child,

30:30.900 --> 30:33.108
fortom'schild.

30:33.132 --> 30:35.810
As the mother of 80%
of Tom's children,

30:35.834 --> 30:38.118
I don't think
it's in their best interest

30:38.142 --> 30:40.907
for you to drive us into
bankruptcy. Of course it isn't.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.820
Here.

30:45.844 --> 30:47.222
I signed the waiver

30:47.246 --> 30:49.876
that the lawyer sent over
with the check.

30:51.951 --> 30:56.161
And I'm not even asking
for any back child support.

30:56.185 --> 30:58.463
That's... that's... that's great.
Thank you.

30:58.487 --> 31:01.606
See, Lynette? See?
It's not all about money.

31:01.630 --> 31:05.170
It's not even a little bit
about money. It's about family.

31:05.194 --> 31:08.373
'Cause we're all
a big family now.

31:08.397 --> 31:10.946
Sort of.

31:10.970 --> 31:14.019
Which is why I took
all the money that you gave me,

31:14.043 --> 31:16.021
and I put it all down

31:16.045 --> 31:18.523
on the sweetest little
2-bedroom house

31:18.547 --> 31:22.387
over on arden drive.

31:22.411 --> 31:24.389
Ar-arden drive over...
Over by the mall?

31:24.413 --> 31:27.623
Like, five-minutes-from-here
arden drive?

31:29.518 --> 31:31.997
It's perfect. I could drop
Kayla off here anytime

31:32.021 --> 31:34.339
so she can play
with her new siblings.

31:34.363 --> 31:36.280
She can spend time with her dad.

31:36.304 --> 31:40.205
Well, to be clear,
how are you going to live?

31:40.229 --> 31:42.547
How are you going to pay
the mortgage?

31:42.571 --> 31:45.985
You don't have a job here. What
is your problem with me, lady?!

31:46.009 --> 31:48.513
I don't understand!
You don't know me.

31:48.537 --> 31:50.285
You don't know what I can do.

31:50.309 --> 31:53.058
And yet you just always, just...

31:53.082 --> 31:55.890
Just... just...

31:55.914 --> 31:59.424
Always on the attack. It's ugly,
and you should work on that.

32:01.690 --> 32:03.898
Here's what I think.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.600
I think that we should
all work on this,

32:05.624 --> 32:08.611
because I don't want
every Christmas to turn ugly

32:08.635 --> 32:11.606
just because you and I
don't get along.

32:11.630 --> 32:15.360
Yeah, that would be a shame.

33:09.758 --> 33:11.736
See, I told you she wasn't home.

33:11.760 --> 33:14.369
Her car's not even here.

33:14.393 --> 33:17.103
And you said the safe
was upstairs?

33:23.672 --> 33:27.112
Damn it, my mother must have
changed the combination.

33:29.178 --> 33:33.438
Okay. Wait here.
I'll be right back.

33:46.325 --> 33:48.795
You did it.

33:54.503 --> 33:56.241
You killed Melanie.

33:56.265 --> 33:59.144
You put your jacket on her body.

33:59.168 --> 34:02.717
I saw it, Matthew.

34:02.741 --> 34:05.390
The police showed me
the pictures.

34:05.414 --> 34:08.101
No, you weren't there.
You don't know what happened.

34:08.125 --> 34:09.293
Oh, god.

34:09.318 --> 34:11.556
Caleb hurt her,

34:11.580 --> 34:14.429
and Melanie threatened to bring
us all down because of that.

34:14.453 --> 34:16.806
So your solution was to make
your brother think

34:16.830 --> 34:19.234
he murdered a girl
and to makemethink it?

34:19.257 --> 34:20.804
What other choice did I have?

34:20.829 --> 34:23.538
I knew that you wouldn't
had Caleb over to the police.

34:23.562 --> 34:25.540
I knew that
you would protect him.

34:25.563 --> 34:27.077
I would have protected you.

34:27.101 --> 34:29.174
Well, I really couldn't
count on that.

34:29.197 --> 34:30.445
Matthew...

34:30.469 --> 34:34.047
You don't love me
as much as you love Caleb.

34:34.072 --> 34:35.371
You never have.

34:37.706 --> 34:39.684
Perhaps.

34:39.708 --> 34:42.487
But it's because
he's needed me more.

34:42.511 --> 34:45.659
You are always going to
find love in the world.

34:45.684 --> 34:47.462
Don't you understand?

34:47.485 --> 34:51.096
He was only ever
going to get it from me.

34:51.120 --> 34:53.290
You know,
I know you believe that.

34:55.724 --> 34:58.304
That's why I've tried
so hard to forgive you.

35:00.169 --> 35:01.646
And who knows?

35:01.670 --> 35:05.500
Maybe one day I will.

35:20.649 --> 35:24.129
9-1-1. What is your emergency?

35:24.153 --> 35:26.563
I need the police.

35:32.701 --> 35:34.861
See, I told you she had cash.

35:57.326 --> 35:59.604
Danielle, I don't know
what you're planning,

35:59.628 --> 36:02.507
but I need to talk to you
right now.

36:02.531 --> 36:04.439
Give it up, mom. We're leaving.

36:04.463 --> 36:06.273
I'm calling the police.

36:11.169 --> 36:13.818
Do you remember
that girl Melanie foster?

36:13.842 --> 36:17.652
Matthew is the one
who killed her.

36:17.676 --> 36:20.154
I know you don't want us
to be together,

36:20.178 --> 36:23.458
but that's the lamest thing
I've ever heard.

36:23.482 --> 36:26.182
His mother told me
what happened. It's true.

36:30.659 --> 36:32.319
Let's go, Danielle.

36:41.330 --> 36:43.248
Mom, please move.

36:43.272 --> 36:45.250
No. I gave up on your brother,

36:45.274 --> 36:48.291
and I'm not gonna make
that mistake with you.

36:48.315 --> 36:51.516
We don't have time for this.

36:51.540 --> 36:55.260
Where did you get that?
What are you doing?!

36:55.284 --> 36:56.821
Move away!

36:56.845 --> 36:58.445
Danielle...

37:00.349 --> 37:02.597
I want you to get out
of the house now.

37:02.621 --> 37:04.599
He's a killer. Shut up!

37:04.623 --> 37:06.240
Don't point that at my mother!

37:06.264 --> 37:07.872
Danielle!

37:07.896 --> 37:09.474
I'm serious. Go.

37:09.498 --> 37:10.935
What's wrong with you?!

37:10.959 --> 37:12.637
I'm gonna shoot you!

37:12.661 --> 37:15.401
Matthew, stop it!

37:20.839 --> 37:23.539
If that's what it takes...

37:25.614 --> 37:27.292
To get my daughter...

37:27.316 --> 37:30.355
Stop it!
To see who you really are...

37:30.379 --> 37:32.827
Stop pointing that at my mother!

37:32.851 --> 37:34.321
Then fine.

37:35.884 --> 37:38.833
What are you doing?! Do it.

37:38.857 --> 37:40.587
Stop!

38:18.667 --> 38:20.375
It's okay, baby.

39:25.394 --> 39:28.042
Hey, it's just me again. Um...

39:28.066 --> 39:30.044
When you got the invitation,

39:30.068 --> 39:32.547
I thought that you gave me
the thumbs up,

39:32.571 --> 39:36.421
but I guess
if that was actually...

39:36.445 --> 39:39.884
Some other type
of finger gesture, uh...

39:39.908 --> 39:43.388
Well, I apologize for leaving
you all these messages

39:43.412 --> 39:46.822
and wasting your time.

40:30.028 --> 40:33.428
This is the street
where I used to live...

40:34.733 --> 40:40.044
And these were the people
with whom I shared my life.

40:40.068 --> 40:43.068
I met them the day
they moved in.

40:46.475 --> 40:49.675
And I saw
what they brought with them...

40:52.821 --> 40:56.731
Beautiful dreams for the future.

40:56.755 --> 41:01.485
And quiet hopes
for a better life...

41:03.932 --> 41:09.102
Not just for themselves,
but for their children, too.

41:10.769 --> 41:15.620
If I could, would I tell them
what lies ahead?

41:15.644 --> 41:18.623
Would I warn them
of the sorrow and betrayal

41:18.647 --> 41:21.926
that lie in store?

41:21.950 --> 41:25.530
No. From where I stand now,

41:25.554 --> 41:27.841
I see enough of the road
to understand

41:27.865 --> 41:31.866
how it must be traveled.

41:31.890 --> 41:35.900
The trick
is to keep moving forward,

41:35.924 --> 41:38.603
to let go of the fear
and the regret

41:38.627 --> 41:40.074
that slow us down

41:40.098 --> 41:42.547
and keep us from enjoying
a journey

41:42.571 --> 41:45.631
that will be over too soon.

41:47.636 --> 41:52.817
Yes, there will be
unexpected bends in the road,

41:52.841 --> 41:57.562
shocking surprises
we didn't see coming,

41:57.586 --> 42:00.525
but that's really the point...

42:00.549 --> 42:02.026
Don't ya think?

42:02.050 --> 42:03.828
Orson. Oh, hey.

42:03.852 --> 42:06.536
I wanted to come by
and see how you were doing

42:06.560 --> 42:09.534
after your great escape,
and, uh, these are for you.

42:09.558 --> 42:13.928
How sweet and... unexpected.

42:17.666 --> 42:19.714
Do you wanna come in?

42:19.738 --> 42:21.738
I'd love to.
