01:26.707 --> 01:28.140
What are you doing here?

01:29.109 --> 01:31.510
Just came to see
what the catch of the day was.

01:32.980 --> 01:35.647
You're glad to see me,
I can tell.

01:35.649 --> 01:37.315
Of course I am.

01:37.317 --> 01:38.717
Hetty send you?

01:38.719 --> 01:41.586
No. No, I came
all on my own.

01:42.656 --> 01:44.623
Work that slow?

01:44.625 --> 01:46.425
On the contrary.

01:46.427 --> 01:47.826
Very busy.

01:47.828 --> 01:49.494
Very exciting stuff
going on

01:49.496 --> 01:52.597
that you're gonna be really
upset that you're missing.

01:52.599 --> 01:55.634
This is nice.

01:55.636 --> 01:57.068
Hmm.

01:58.138 --> 02:01.106
It's heaven.

02:01.108 --> 02:02.407
Mm-hmm.

02:02.409 --> 02:04.776
How long are you
gonna stay?

02:06.713 --> 02:08.814
Probably...

02:08.816 --> 02:11.983
one or two days past forever.

02:11.985 --> 02:14.619
Well, you told me you
were taking time off

02:14.621 --> 02:17.556
to be with your kids.

02:17.558 --> 02:19.257
Kamran has been posting
for several weeks now

02:19.259 --> 02:20.425
about her freshman
experience at Stockdale,

02:20.427 --> 02:22.194
and I happen to
know for a fact

02:22.196 --> 02:25.864
that classes began at Annapolis
over a month ago.

02:25.866 --> 02:27.299
So...

02:27.301 --> 02:29.234
by the looks of it,

02:29.236 --> 02:31.369
the only thing around
here is, uh...

02:31.371 --> 02:32.771
you and...

02:32.773 --> 02:35.774
terrified sea life.

02:37.344 --> 02:39.778
I'm happy, G.

02:40.647 --> 02:42.380
No, you're not.

02:42.382 --> 02:44.082
I mean, you
think you are.

02:44.084 --> 02:45.917
I get that--
but you're not.

02:45.919 --> 02:49.020
Look, I get it.
Thi...

02:49.022 --> 02:50.188
This is awesome.

02:50.190 --> 02:51.223
It is peaceful,

02:51.225 --> 02:53.592
it is relaxing,
it is quiet.

02:53.594 --> 02:55.794
It's beautiful.

02:56.730 --> 02:59.231
It's just not you.

03:01.802 --> 03:03.702
You left a big hole behind.

03:04.505 --> 03:06.972
Find a replacement.

03:07.841 --> 03:09.441
It's not that easy.

03:09.443 --> 03:11.076
I didn't say
it was easy.

03:11.078 --> 03:15.046
But you can't find someone
if you don't start looking.

03:15.048 --> 03:16.882
I don't want to have
to train anybody.

03:16.884 --> 03:18.517
Geez, it took me
long enough with you.

03:18.519 --> 03:20.986
It's good to know you still
have your sense of humor.

03:22.055 --> 03:24.022
What, do you want
more money, huh?

03:24.024 --> 03:26.992
You want your own office?

03:26.994 --> 03:29.694
What is it gonna take
to bring you back?

03:36.103 --> 03:38.403
A miracle.

03:39.206 --> 03:42.674
So... unless
you have one

03:42.676 --> 03:44.709
hiding up your sleeve...

03:44.711 --> 03:47.212
save your breath,
drink your beer...

03:47.214 --> 03:48.914
enjoy the view.

03:50.183 --> 03:53.285
Go inside and rinse off,
make us some breakfast.

03:53.287 --> 03:55.453
Hope you're hungry.

04:02.062 --> 04:04.129
<i>When was the last time</i>
<i>you talked to your mom?</i>

04:04.131 --> 04:05.230
<i>I don't know. Why?</i>

04:05.232 --> 04:06.598
What?

04:06.600 --> 04:08.166
You haven't told
her yet, have you?

04:08.168 --> 04:10.235
Trust me, you do not
want me to tell her...

04:10.237 --> 04:11.736
Oh, God.
...because once I tell her,

04:11.738 --> 04:13.138
she's gonna be
all over this.

04:13.140 --> 04:15.240
Deeks, you are putting me
in an awful position, okay?

04:15.242 --> 04:16.952
She deserves to know. You
have to tell her, come on.

04:16.954 --> 04:17.640
I will.

04:17.644 --> 04:19.810
- When?
- Right after the honeymoon.

04:19.813 --> 04:22.213
- Deeks!
- Relax, all right?

04:22.215 --> 04:24.516
If you told your mom,
then she definitely told my mom.

04:24.518 --> 04:26.017
Then why hasn't
she said anything?

04:26.019 --> 04:27.218
Oh. Maybe it's
because she's angry

04:27.220 --> 04:29.421
that she heard it
from my mom and not us.

04:29.423 --> 04:31.690
No, 'cause if she was angry,
we'd definitely hear about it

04:31.692 --> 04:33.725
over and over
and over again.

04:33.727 --> 04:35.560
Oh, my gosh, what if
she doesn't approve?

04:35.562 --> 04:37.228
Are you out of your mind?

04:37.230 --> 04:38.830
She likes you
more than she likes me.

04:38.832 --> 04:40.765
That's not tr...
Well, okay, maybe.

04:40.767 --> 04:42.367
But if you called
her, she wouldn't.

04:42.369 --> 04:44.269
You want me to call her?
Yeah, I do.

04:44.271 --> 04:46.438
- You really want me to call her?
- That's what I'm saying.

04:46.440 --> 04:48.640
- Fine. Fine, I'll call her.
- Good.

04:48.642 --> 04:49.941
It's not good.

04:49.943 --> 04:51.242
Let's be perfectly
clear about this.

04:51.244 --> 04:54.012
This is gonna be
very, very bad.

04:54.014 --> 04:55.647
But that's fine.

04:55.649 --> 04:57.716
That's fine.
I'm calling her.

04:57.718 --> 04:58.850
Okay.

04:58.852 --> 05:00.685
This is Bert.
Leave a message.

05:00.687 --> 05:02.053
Voice mail.

05:02.055 --> 05:03.888
Mama, hey. It's Marty.

05:03.890 --> 05:06.491
Listen, I was just calling
to, uh...

05:06.493 --> 05:08.259
to check in on you,

05:08.261 --> 05:09.327
and, uh...

05:09.329 --> 05:10.462
Not important.

05:10.464 --> 05:12.197
Just call me back
whenever you can.

05:12.199 --> 05:14.499
Not a rush.
Could be today or tomorrow

05:14.501 --> 05:16.234
or... next month.

05:16.236 --> 05:19.337
Okay. I love you, Mama.

05:20.741 --> 05:22.007
Happy?

05:22.009 --> 05:23.308
Ecstatic.

05:23.310 --> 05:24.709
Great. Good.

05:24.711 --> 05:26.277
Wonderful.
This is love.

05:26.279 --> 05:27.779
Horrible person!

05:58.345 --> 05:59.611
Oh, my God!

05:59.613 --> 06:00.912
Ooh! Aah!

06:00.914 --> 06:02.881
I give! I give!

06:08.689 --> 06:10.121
Hi.

06:10.123 --> 06:11.523
How'd you know
it was me?

06:11.525 --> 06:13.658
Seriously, Beale?
Avocado season's over.

06:13.660 --> 06:16.227
There's no reason
to be passing out flyers.

06:16.229 --> 06:18.263
That's probably why Deeks got
such a good deal on the rental.

06:19.232 --> 06:21.066
Why'd I listen
to him anyway?

06:21.068 --> 06:22.267
For the future,
a simple hat,

06:22.269 --> 06:23.401
a pair of sunglasses,

06:23.403 --> 06:25.503
might be a tad less
conspicuous.

06:25.505 --> 06:27.072
That's the genius
of it, though.

06:27.074 --> 06:29.340
Nobody expects a
giant vegetable.

06:29.342 --> 06:31.843
Well, technically, an avocado is
a fruit with a single nut, so...

06:31.845 --> 06:34.112
...have fun with that.

06:34.114 --> 06:35.346
That's a coincidence.

06:35.348 --> 06:36.481
What?

06:36.483 --> 06:38.083
My phone is
in my pocket.

06:38.085 --> 06:40.418
Can...
Yeah, I got you covered.

06:40.420 --> 06:42.053
Emergency alert.

06:42.055 --> 06:43.888
"All hands on deck.

06:43.890 --> 06:45.090
This is not a drill."
Let's go.

06:45.092 --> 06:46.858
Holy moly, guacamole.

06:54.367 --> 06:56.668
Special Agent Callen.
Nice to finally meet you.

06:56.670 --> 06:59.003
Special Agent
Harley Hidoko.

06:59.005 --> 07:01.139
Executive assistant
to the EAD-PAC.

07:01.141 --> 07:02.574
Did you send this alert?

07:02.576 --> 07:04.109
No. I did.

07:04.111 --> 07:07.712
Executive Assistant
Director Mosley.

07:07.714 --> 07:09.981
I've been assigned
by NCIS headquarters

07:09.983 --> 07:12.050
to replace Owen Granger.

07:12.052 --> 07:15.653
And to find a new operations
manager for this unit.

07:15.655 --> 07:17.355
Where's Hetty?

07:17.357 --> 07:19.390
Probably halfway to Fiji by now.

07:19.392 --> 07:21.960
And why do you say that?

07:21.962 --> 07:23.762
Well, because she always said

07:23.764 --> 07:27.132
she wanted to sail into
the sunset when she retired.

07:28.535 --> 07:31.236
Surely she told you.

07:31.238 --> 07:33.738
That's why you sent
this emergency message?

07:33.740 --> 07:35.073
No.

07:35.075 --> 07:36.274
I sent that message because

07:36.276 --> 07:37.609
we've received Intel
that North Korea

07:37.611 --> 07:39.911
is launching a missile
at Los Angeles.

07:39.913 --> 07:41.613
Today.

07:55.270 --> 07:57.737
Think this threat
from North Korea's legit?

07:57.739 --> 07:59.139
I doubt it.

07:59.141 --> 08:00.740
I'm more concerned
about Hetty.

08:00.742 --> 08:03.276
She always leaves
a contingency plan with Nell.

08:03.278 --> 08:05.278
Not this time. I swear.

08:05.280 --> 08:06.446
This is the first
I'm hearing of this.

08:06.448 --> 08:08.148
Beale?

08:08.150 --> 08:10.383
Oh, don't look at me--
I haven't seen her for days.

08:10.385 --> 08:11.818
But you know Hetty.

08:11.820 --> 08:14.921
Maybe Michelle's death
was hard on Sam <i>and</i> Hetty.

08:16.024 --> 08:18.625
Ladies and gentlemen,
what we have here

08:18.627 --> 08:20.527
is a time-sensitive situation.

08:21.730 --> 08:24.998
Defense Intelligence
Agent Thomas Park

08:25.000 --> 08:27.067
was supposed to be stationed
in South Korea, but last night

08:27.069 --> 08:29.402
he fell to his death
outside a Sunset nightclub.

08:29.404 --> 08:31.371
The initial police report
is on your desks.

08:31.373 --> 08:34.474
We're still waiting
on the coroner's results.

08:38.113 --> 08:40.514
How do I get this
to the big screen?

08:40.515 --> 08:41.982
Yeah. It can
be tricky.

08:41.984 --> 08:43.082
Yeah.

08:43.085 --> 08:44.651
So, uh, Mosley,

08:44.653 --> 08:45.552
huh?

08:45.554 --> 08:48.688
Is that, uh...
is that Irish?

08:48.690 --> 08:50.490
Irish?

08:50.492 --> 08:51.791
Irish.

08:51.793 --> 08:53.960
Irish...

08:55.597 --> 08:57.964
Not Irish.

08:57.966 --> 09:01.268
Um, your operating system
is 4.8.

09:01.270 --> 09:03.436
4.8? Oh,

09:03.438 --> 09:04.504
we will
definitely need

09:04.506 --> 09:06.673
to update that for
you.

09:06.675 --> 09:08.508
So what was he doing

09:08.510 --> 09:10.243
- in Los Angeles?
- We're not sure.

09:10.245 --> 09:12.712
Agent Park was
a bit of a wild card.

09:12.714 --> 09:14.514
His supervisors
didn't even know he was here.

09:14.516 --> 09:16.349
He boarded a flight
to L.A. yesterday

09:16.351 --> 09:17.918
with no checked luggage.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.653
He was a part
of an intelligence task force

09:19.655 --> 09:21.354
assigned
to North Korea's aerospace

09:21.356 --> 09:22.189
and missile program.

09:22.191 --> 09:23.623
Minutes before
his death,

09:23.625 --> 09:25.659
he sent this text.

09:29.164 --> 09:31.198
- That could mean anything.
- Well, even if it did,

09:31.200 --> 09:32.832
I mean, North Korea
doesn't have the technology

09:32.834 --> 09:34.668
to hit us with an ICBM.

09:34.670 --> 09:37.204
DIA Agent Park lost his life
to get us this information.

09:37.206 --> 09:40.040
I think we need to take this
as a legitimate threat.

09:40.042 --> 09:42.142
We have copies of
Agent Park's open cases.

09:42.144 --> 09:44.611
Hopefully, they can help us
determine which one was in play.

09:44.613 --> 09:46.413
This is
a priority assignment,

09:46.415 --> 09:48.215
so I'd like Agent Callen
and Agent Blye

09:48.217 --> 09:49.382
working this.

09:49.384 --> 09:51.017
Oh, you know, that's
a good... idea.

09:51.019 --> 09:53.453
What we usually do, just for
the record, is that I work...

09:53.455 --> 09:54.988
Uh, I'm
sorry, Detective.

09:54.990 --> 09:56.623
I know you've played
an important role

09:56.625 --> 09:58.024
with this team in the past,

09:58.026 --> 10:00.327
but this falls
under national security.

10:00.329 --> 10:02.429
- Oh.
- You'd be most helpful now

10:02.431 --> 10:04.531
if you returned to LAPD

10:04.533 --> 10:07.801
and kept us updated on their
end of the investigation.

10:07.803 --> 10:10.704
Thank you
for your understanding.

10:10.706 --> 10:12.372
Yeah,
no, of course.

10:12.374 --> 10:13.907
I just don't really...
understand what...

10:13.909 --> 10:17.277
you just...
Good talk. Okay.

10:23.485 --> 10:25.652
Hi. Hi. Cheers.

10:25.654 --> 10:28.922
Well, well.

10:28.924 --> 10:31.124
The prodigal son has returned.

10:31.126 --> 10:34.494
What did you finally do
to piss off Thumbelina?

10:34.496 --> 10:36.763
Wasn't Hetty;
she's retired.

10:36.765 --> 10:38.965
We got a new
sheriff in town.

10:38.967 --> 10:41.001
Well, I'm surprised
you lasted this long.

10:41.003 --> 10:43.270
Thanks for that
vote of confidence.

10:43.272 --> 10:46.139
You got a desk for me?

10:46.141 --> 10:49.142
Oh, you bet I do.

11:13.435 --> 11:17.704
Hetty, please call me back
and tell me what's going on.

11:20.942 --> 11:22.375
Maybe this is a play.

11:22.377 --> 11:24.344
For what?

11:28.050 --> 11:31.151
Well, you never
know with Hetty.

11:31.153 --> 11:33.219
You all right?

11:33.221 --> 11:36.122
Yeah, just, you know,
I mean, I don't like

11:36.124 --> 11:37.724
that Deeks has been
sent back to LAPD,

11:37.726 --> 11:39.125
but what am I
gonna do about it?

11:41.496 --> 11:42.962
What do you got, Eric?

11:42.964 --> 11:45.799
Every law enforcement agency
has been put on high alert

11:45.801 --> 11:47.834
with this North
Korean threat,

11:47.836 --> 11:50.303
but there's a gag order not
to share it with the public

11:50.305 --> 11:51.438
or the media.

11:51.440 --> 11:53.340
They probably don't want
people panicking.

11:53.342 --> 11:55.408
And none of the agencies
have been able to confirm

11:55.410 --> 11:56.776
this is a viable threat.

11:57.746 --> 11:59.145
Great.

11:59.147 --> 12:01.681
First case with Mosley
is a wild goose chase.

12:01.683 --> 12:02.882
Hey, did you find Hetty?

12:02.884 --> 12:06.820
Um, not yet, but I did
check with Washington.

12:06.822 --> 12:09.756
Callen, her retirement
is legit.

12:09.758 --> 12:11.725
It went into effect last week.

12:11.727 --> 12:12.992
Doesn't mean anything.

12:12.994 --> 12:14.861
It could still be one
of Hetty's elaborate ploys.

12:14.863 --> 12:16.696
Maybe she's gunning for
assistant director gig

12:16.698 --> 12:18.498
and this is her way
of applying leverage.

12:18.500 --> 12:20.700
Might be why
she's not talking to us.

12:20.702 --> 12:21.868
I don't think so.

12:21.870 --> 12:23.903
Hetty has unloaded
three of her properties

12:23.905 --> 12:26.740
in the last two months:
the beach house,

12:26.742 --> 12:29.242
the downtown loft and the condo
in the Argyle

12:29.244 --> 12:30.210
have all been sold.

12:30.212 --> 12:31.611
What about her place
in Hancock Park?

12:31.613 --> 12:32.746
Not yet,

12:32.748 --> 12:34.247
but it is listed.

12:34.249 --> 12:35.582
What about her boat?

12:35.584 --> 12:36.883
Uh...

12:38.053 --> 12:40.086
Gone.

12:40.088 --> 12:42.021
Did she sell it?

12:42.023 --> 12:43.123
I can try to find out.

12:43.125 --> 12:44.891
Can you track it?

12:44.893 --> 12:46.393
Well, either she turned
her transponder off

12:46.395 --> 12:47.660
or she's out of range.

12:47.662 --> 12:48.962
Now, I can try
to extend the search

12:48.964 --> 12:52.098
with the help of the Navy,
but that might take

12:52.100 --> 12:54.401
some time, so we're
gonna have to...

12:54.403 --> 12:56.503
I got to go.

12:56.505 --> 12:57.971
What was that?

12:57.973 --> 12:59.806
What?

12:59.808 --> 13:03.309
Oh, uh, that-that
was nothing.

13:03.311 --> 13:05.478
Looked like a marina.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.247
Oh, that.

13:07.249 --> 13:09.082
Oh, marina.
Yes, um,

13:09.084 --> 13:12.085
we have been trying to get
a slip in Marina Del Rey

13:12.087 --> 13:13.754
for what, like,
three years now, um...

13:13.778 --> 13:15.356
Three years.

13:15.357 --> 13:17.390
...so, sometimes we
just tap their security

13:17.392 --> 13:19.459
to see if they have
anything available.

13:19.461 --> 13:20.927
Shh.

13:20.929 --> 13:23.196
You two have a boat?

13:23.198 --> 13:24.964
Yes.
No.

13:24.966 --> 13:26.166
Well, we...
Well...

13:26.168 --> 13:28.034
- we ha...
- we ha... technically, had...

13:28.036 --> 13:30.336
- Past tense-- had a boat.
- ...a boat.

13:30.338 --> 13:31.771
But it...
But then it sunk.

13:31.773 --> 13:33.306
To the bottom.
So...

13:33.308 --> 13:34.641
Davy Jones' Locker.

13:34.643 --> 13:37.243
How?

13:40.449 --> 13:42.282
Okay, well,

13:42.284 --> 13:44.050
let's just keep this
our little secret.

13:44.052 --> 13:45.218
But whatever you do,
don't let Mosley catch you

13:45.220 --> 13:46.186
using our resources

13:46.188 --> 13:47.787
for personal use.

13:47.789 --> 13:49.309
That's a fireable offense
in her books.

13:49.925 --> 13:52.025
Wow, okay.
Okay.

13:52.027 --> 13:56.162
So, uh, no <i>World of Warcraft</i>
on the big screen?

13:57.599 --> 13:58.798
Kidding.

13:58.800 --> 13:59.833
He's a kidder.

13:59.835 --> 14:02.535
She doesn't like kidders,
either.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.237
Good to know.

14:06.041 --> 14:08.241
Oo-Kay.

14:13.415 --> 14:16.282
He must've climbed over the
glass and out onto that ledge.

14:16.284 --> 14:18.718
It's the only way he could've
landed where he did.

14:18.720 --> 14:20.320
Probably high as a kite.

14:20.322 --> 14:22.255
Unless it was suicide.

14:22.257 --> 14:23.857
Anybody see him?
Not till he hit the limo.

14:23.859 --> 14:25.792
What if he came out up there?

14:25.794 --> 14:28.027
No public access to that floor.

14:30.799 --> 14:31.998
This is always locked.

14:38.006 --> 14:39.506
Hmm.

14:41.576 --> 14:43.943
Well, we've got blood.

14:43.945 --> 14:46.045
And we've got scuff marks.

14:46.047 --> 14:48.581
Looks like he was dragged
backwards

14:48.583 --> 14:50.483
and...

14:50.485 --> 14:51.651
he was bleeding.
Grabbed anything he could

14:51.653 --> 14:52.652
before they threw him
out the window.

14:52.654 --> 14:54.621
Did you and
your staff see him

14:54.623 --> 14:56.389
with anybody or see him have
an altercation with anyone?

14:56.391 --> 14:58.024
No.

14:58.026 --> 15:00.560
Can we see your security footage
from that night?

15:00.562 --> 15:02.629
We already showed the cops.

15:02.631 --> 15:05.365
Did they see the
footage from this area?

15:11.873 --> 15:13.740
You recognize
either of them?

15:13.742 --> 15:16.342
I've never seen that guy before,
but this one's

15:16.344 --> 15:18.711
in here a lot.

15:33.634 --> 15:35.567
So, his name is Michael Lee.

15:35.569 --> 15:36.868
He is a graduate student

15:36.870 --> 15:39.771
who entered the country from
Vancouver six months ago

15:39.773 --> 15:41.339
on a Canadian passport.

15:41.341 --> 15:43.108
Yeah, talk to Canadian
authorities.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.643
It might be bogus.

15:44.645 --> 15:46.778
It's a lot easier to enter the
country posing as a Canadian.

15:46.780 --> 15:48.313
According
to school records here,

15:48.315 --> 15:50.515
he's working towards
his PhD in physics,

15:50.517 --> 15:53.285
but there's nothing
out of the ordinary.

15:53.287 --> 15:55.253
I mean, no apparent
connections to North Korea

15:55.255 --> 15:57.289
or our dead DIA Agent
Tommy Park.

15:57.291 --> 15:59.524
What about the other guy
who was with him?

15:59.526 --> 16:00.659
No, we're still running
facial rec on him.

16:00.661 --> 16:02.928
Do we have an address
on Michael Lee?

16:02.930 --> 16:04.496
Yup, it's already
on your phone.

16:04.498 --> 16:06.531
Look, keep looking
into Michael Lee.

16:06.533 --> 16:07.933
See if there's anything that
can tie him to the cases

16:07.935 --> 16:09.267
that Agent Park
was working on.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.469
Yup, you got it.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.138
<i>"Peaceful resolution"?</i>

16:13.140 --> 16:15.140
Who am I, Gandhi?

16:15.142 --> 16:17.075
I didn't make up the
three-strike rule.

16:17.077 --> 16:20.045
If it was up to me, I'd have an
electric chair in my station.

16:20.047 --> 16:21.947
Wow.
Yeah.

16:21.949 --> 16:24.115
Yeah, you could quote me
on that.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.584
Don't quote...

16:26.887 --> 16:28.286
You know what I hate
about lawyers, Deeks?

16:28.288 --> 16:29.921
Hmm?

16:29.923 --> 16:31.523
Everything.

16:32.926 --> 16:33.653
Yeah.

16:33.677 --> 16:35.528
How are you settling
in to your new desk?

16:35.529 --> 16:37.462
Yeah, about that,
I thought we were, uh,

16:37.464 --> 16:39.230
I thought we were friends.

16:39.232 --> 16:41.333
Deeks.

16:41.335 --> 16:43.068
Friends are just people
who haven't figured out

16:43.070 --> 16:44.669
what they want from you yet.

16:44.671 --> 16:46.771
So, what do you want?

16:46.773 --> 16:48.206
And don't say a different desk,

16:48.208 --> 16:49.708
'cause that's the best I
could do on short notice.

16:49.710 --> 16:51.676
Have you heard anything
about a possible missile strike

16:51.678 --> 16:53.011
on Los Angeles?

16:53.013 --> 16:56.081
Oh. You've been hanging out

16:56.083 --> 16:57.415
with the secret squirrels
too long, Deeks.

16:57.417 --> 16:59.351
No way a missile
is getting

16:59.353 --> 17:01.519
this far unless it's strapped
to a dolphin.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.121
And what if you're wrong?

17:03.123 --> 17:06.023
Maybe I don't have
to pay alimony anymore.

17:06.026 --> 17:09.694
Wow.
You just said that out loud.

17:09.695 --> 17:12.364
Okay, uh, I'm gonna go
to the crime scene

17:12.366 --> 17:13.897
and then check on my mom.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.733
You forget the lunch
she packed you?

17:15.736 --> 17:18.637
No, I just haven't
heard back from her

17:18.638 --> 17:20.005
in a couple of days.

17:20.007 --> 17:21.339
I'm gonna check in on her.

17:21.340 --> 17:22.507
Really?

17:22.509 --> 17:23.875
Yeah, I'm gonna make sure
she's okay.

17:23.877 --> 17:24.876
No, I-I mean,

17:24.877 --> 17:26.411
why are you telling me this?

17:26.413 --> 17:27.612
Uh, you're a grown man, Deeks.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.114
I mean, what do I care if
you go see your mother.

17:29.116 --> 17:31.916
I mean, do-do you need me to
write you a note or something?

17:31.918 --> 17:34.019
I, uh, I'm used
to working on a team

17:34.021 --> 17:36.221
and therefore, I thought
I was being considerate

17:36.223 --> 17:37.889
in case anyone here needed me.

17:37.891 --> 17:40.625
Oh.

17:40.627 --> 17:42.227
Does anybody need

17:42.229 --> 17:44.262
Detective Deeks
right now?!

17:44.264 --> 17:45.363
Who?

17:45.365 --> 17:47.732
No.
Hmm, yeah.

17:47.734 --> 17:49.534
Ah, we're good.

17:49.536 --> 17:52.170
Hey, uh, you're an ass.

17:52.172 --> 17:53.471
Thank you.

17:53.473 --> 17:54.739
- It's good to have you back, too, Deeks.
- Yeah.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.075
Oh, and tell
your mom I said,

17:57.077 --> 17:59.778
"What's up?"

18:01.014 --> 18:03.381
That's not gonna happen.
Oh, no?

18:03.383 --> 18:04.616
Not gonna happen.
Tell her!

18:04.618 --> 18:06.384
No, I'm not saying anything
to her.

18:14.327 --> 18:17.662
Now we find out what kind of
boss Mosley is gonna be.

18:17.664 --> 18:20.031
Okay.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.076
Go for Mosley.

18:31.078 --> 18:34.579
Yeah, one of the guys that threw
Agent Park off the building

18:34.581 --> 18:36.147
was, uh, identified
as a graduate student.

18:36.149 --> 18:37.348
We're at his house.
The door is locked.

18:37.350 --> 18:38.383
There's no one home.

18:38.385 --> 18:40.385
Cell phone is going straight
to voice mail.

18:40.387 --> 18:43.254
We need to know what got
Agent Park killed.

18:43.256 --> 18:45.557
Mm-hmm. Well,
as you well know,

18:45.559 --> 18:47.559
we will need a warrant
to search the house.

18:47.561 --> 18:50.562
Agent Callen, these are
exigent circumstances.

18:50.564 --> 18:53.465
You let me worry about
the legal ramifications

18:53.467 --> 18:56.868
while you find out
who killed Agent Park.

18:56.870 --> 18:58.803
Absolutely.

18:58.805 --> 19:00.405
Oh, and Agent Callen,

19:00.407 --> 19:04.209
I hope I passed your test.

19:04.211 --> 19:06.945
Okay.

19:06.947 --> 19:09.414
If it wasn't for Deeks, I'd
almost start to like this woman.

19:15.222 --> 19:17.055
Michael Lee?

19:17.057 --> 19:20.391
Federal agents, can we
come in and talk to you?

19:38.612 --> 19:39.978
Clear.

19:39.980 --> 19:41.579
Clear.

19:41.581 --> 19:44.048
This guy is neat.

19:44.050 --> 19:45.583
Yeah, I'll say.

19:45.585 --> 19:47.218
Probably has a housekeeper.

19:47.220 --> 19:49.187
Or he's OCD.

19:49.189 --> 19:52.090
Got a crosscut shredder.

19:55.996 --> 19:57.529
Looks like he's flushing
whatever he's shredding.

19:57.531 --> 19:59.697
Must hate his homework.

19:59.699 --> 20:03.768
Even his garbage
can is neat.

20:12.112 --> 20:17.148
Energy drinks, takeout.

20:17.150 --> 20:19.684
And a cell phone.

20:19.686 --> 20:22.253
Actually,

20:22.255 --> 20:24.155
two cell...

20:26.927 --> 20:28.259
...three cell phones.

20:28.261 --> 20:31.563
All different makes,
all different models.

20:31.565 --> 20:33.731
Bought at different stores.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.300
Seems inefficient to me.

20:35.302 --> 20:38.036
That seems like spycraft.

20:44.711 --> 20:46.344
Mom?

20:46.346 --> 20:47.679
What...

20:51.952 --> 20:53.418
Yeah, stay down.
Don't shoot.

20:53.420 --> 20:54.886
Stay down.
Don't shoot. Bertie. Bertie!

20:54.888 --> 20:55.820
Don't shoot.

20:55.822 --> 20:57.355
Marty, what the hell
are you doing?

20:57.357 --> 20:59.557
- No! Mom, he was in the kitchen.
- That's... that's Guy.

20:59.559 --> 21:02.227
Put your gun down,
you're scaring him.

21:02.229 --> 21:05.096
I'm sorry.
Put your gun do...

21:05.098 --> 21:08.733
Was that really
necessary?

21:08.735 --> 21:11.069
Wait a minute, is he...

21:11.071 --> 21:13.938
Were you guys just...
Is thi...

21:13.940 --> 21:16.574
No. No, oh...

21:16.576 --> 21:18.276
Martin.
Mom!

21:18.278 --> 21:20.044
You get back here
right now.

21:24.918 --> 21:26.417
What's the matter
with you?

21:26.419 --> 21:28.019
What's the matter
with me?

21:28.021 --> 21:30.054
What's the matter with you?
I've called you every day

21:30.056 --> 21:31.890
for, like, the past five days.
- No, you haven't.

21:31.892 --> 21:34.225
No, I haven't, but I
called you five times today.

21:34.227 --> 21:36.227
I was busy.
Yeah.

21:36.229 --> 21:37.862
That's obvious,
that you were...

21:37.864 --> 21:39.230
you were busy--
oh...

21:39.232 --> 21:41.299
Okay, you know what,
Mom, I was just...

21:41.301 --> 21:43.601
I was worried about you, okay?
I was worried about you.

21:43.603 --> 21:44.602
Well, then, you should
have called me

21:44.604 --> 21:46.804
several weeks ago.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.406
And then you could have
told me

21:48.408 --> 21:51.209
about your engagement.

21:52.579 --> 21:53.912
So Kensi's mom
called you?

21:53.914 --> 21:55.947
Of course she called me.
She was ecstatic.

21:55.949 --> 21:57.882
I, on the other hand,
was surprised

21:57.884 --> 22:01.019
and embarrassed since I didn't
know a damn thing about it.

22:01.021 --> 22:02.353
Listen, Mom, I'm sorry,
I just didn't...

22:02.355 --> 22:03.721
Eh, save it.

22:03.723 --> 22:06.024
You don't want me
to get involved, I get it.

22:06.026 --> 22:08.393
- No, that's not what it is.
- Yeah, that is what it is.

22:08.395 --> 22:10.595
But you know what?
I don't care.

22:10.597 --> 22:12.630
- Don't say that, 'cause you do care.
- No.

22:12.632 --> 22:14.666
I've got a wedding
of my own to plan.

22:14.668 --> 22:17.001
What?

22:17.003 --> 22:19.170
It's high time you finally
had a new father.

22:19.172 --> 22:20.505
Oh, my God, Mom!

22:20.507 --> 22:22.373
Oh, relax, Martin,
I'm just kidding you.

22:22.375 --> 22:23.942
Don't get your knickers
in a twist, we're just friends.

22:23.944 --> 22:24.976
Okay, that's fine.

22:24.978 --> 22:27.078
With benefits.
Stop talking.

22:27.080 --> 22:28.613
If you know what I mean.
Mom!

22:28.615 --> 22:30.615
The sex.
Mom!

22:30.617 --> 22:31.849
I'm going.
I gotta go to work.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.051
Well, don't you
want to meet Guy?

22:33.053 --> 22:34.218
No, no, I don't.

22:34.220 --> 22:35.286
Well, I think it's
the least you could do

22:35.288 --> 22:36.921
since you almost shot him.

22:36.923 --> 22:38.890
Okay, "Guy" isn't even
a real name.

22:38.892 --> 22:40.458
It's French.

22:40.460 --> 22:41.960
Is it?

22:41.962 --> 22:43.361
Well, you're the one
who told me

22:43.363 --> 22:45.029
I should get a trainer.

22:46.099 --> 22:47.298
He's your trainer?

22:47.300 --> 22:49.367
Oh, yeah.

22:49.369 --> 22:51.469
Oh... Oh...

22:52.472 --> 22:53.972
I don't feel good.
I love you.

22:53.974 --> 22:55.239
I don't love...

22:55.241 --> 22:56.307
I love you, honey.

22:56.309 --> 22:57.408
I love you!

22:57.410 --> 22:59.344
Have a nice afternoon.
Mom, let's, uh...

22:59.346 --> 23:01.846
I know I will.
What?!

23:04.284 --> 23:06.651
It's a big safe.

23:06.653 --> 23:08.653
What do you think's
in there?

23:08.655 --> 23:11.556
I don't know, but you
can color me curious.

23:11.558 --> 23:13.458
Think you can open it?

23:13.460 --> 23:15.226
Maybe.

23:16.296 --> 23:18.296
Nope.

23:18.298 --> 23:19.697
Resourceful.

23:19.699 --> 23:21.733
- Yeah, it was worth a shot.
- Mm.

23:26.539 --> 23:28.339
Got uniforms.

23:30.243 --> 23:32.777
Hmm.

23:39.753 --> 23:41.519
Federal agents!
Don't move.

23:45.792 --> 23:47.358
We got runners.

23:49.329 --> 23:51.362
Get down!

23:51.998 --> 23:53.564
Go.

24:15.132 --> 24:17.433
Hey. You okay?
What happened?

24:17.435 --> 24:19.168
Yeah, hey, uh, shootout

24:19.170 --> 24:20.803
with the two guys who threw
Agent Park off the roof.

24:20.805 --> 24:22.004
One of them got away,
but not before

24:22.006 --> 24:24.473
he put several bullets
into his buddy.

24:24.475 --> 24:26.608
So "unfriended" the hard way.
Mm.

24:26.610 --> 24:27.709
How was your day?

24:27.711 --> 24:29.511
Uh, not much better.

24:29.513 --> 24:32.548
Saw my mom.
And?

24:32.550 --> 24:34.750
And I can't talk about it.
I have permanent scarring.

24:34.752 --> 24:37.019
- What?
- Well, we could have used you today, Deeks.

24:37.021 --> 24:38.387
Well, talk to your boss
about that.

24:38.389 --> 24:40.522
I intend to.

24:41.759 --> 24:43.358
Let's hope they got
the extended warranty.

24:43.360 --> 24:44.426
- Yeah.
- Let's hope that the Wonder Twins can

24:44.428 --> 24:47.196
can get something off of this.
Great.

24:47.198 --> 24:48.530
Thanks for that.

24:48.532 --> 24:50.265
Oy...

24:52.102 --> 24:54.169
This is Sam, leave a message.

24:54.171 --> 24:55.671
I hope you're having
a good day at the beach.

24:55.673 --> 24:58.073
I thought you might want to know
what I came back to.

24:58.075 --> 25:00.209
First off, Hetty's gone.

25:00.211 --> 25:02.211
She has retired, officially.

25:02.213 --> 25:03.512
She sold her properties,

25:03.514 --> 25:04.713
the boat is gone.

25:04.715 --> 25:07.583
Someone named "Mosley" has
taken over for Granger.

25:07.585 --> 25:09.585
Sent Deeks back to LAPD.

25:09.587 --> 25:11.487
Oh, and we have
plausible Intel

25:11.489 --> 25:17.226
that the DPRK is launching
an ICBM at Los Angeles today.

25:17.228 --> 25:20.362
So, unless you're busy
tormenting a squid

25:20.364 --> 25:21.463
or something like that,
why don't you just

25:21.465 --> 25:22.898
swing on by and maybe
lend a hand,

25:22.900 --> 25:24.967
just for old times' sake?

25:24.969 --> 25:27.302
Okay, bye-bye.

25:36.046 --> 25:38.614
Shootout adjacent
to a college campus.

25:38.616 --> 25:39.748
Not exactly what I wanted

25:39.750 --> 25:41.283
on my first day here,
Agent Callen.

25:41.285 --> 25:42.818
You think I did?

25:42.820 --> 25:44.486
Our biggest lead is dead.

25:44.488 --> 25:46.588
OSP is supposed to be

25:46.590 --> 25:49.091
an elite unit, not
a bunch of cowboys.

25:49.093 --> 25:52.060
And why is Deeks back?
Because we need him.

25:52.062 --> 25:53.395
If we'd had him today,

25:53.397 --> 25:54.930
we might have been able
to prevent what happened.

25:54.932 --> 25:57.165
Are you telling me
you can't do your job

25:57.167 --> 25:59.001
without Detective Deeks?

25:59.003 --> 26:01.236
I'm telling you
to let me run my team

26:01.238 --> 26:02.671
the way I see fit.

26:02.673 --> 26:04.806
You want to make
this unit stronger, great.

26:04.808 --> 26:07.776
But all you've done so far
is weaken it.

26:08.979 --> 26:10.212
You want me to
respect your decisions?

26:10.214 --> 26:12.147
Fine.

26:12.149 --> 26:14.716
Then you better start
respecting mine as well.

26:17.755 --> 26:19.888
Fair enough.

26:19.890 --> 26:22.357
Detective Deeks stays.

26:22.359 --> 26:23.792
Until I find
a more suitable

26:23.794 --> 26:24.993
replacement.

26:24.995 --> 26:26.562
Whom we both agree on.

26:26.564 --> 26:29.998
This is not a democracy,
Agent Callen.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.434
What is it,
a dictatorship?

26:33.871 --> 26:35.837
Careful, Agent Callen.

26:35.839 --> 26:37.973
Let's not get off
on the wrong foot.

26:40.344 --> 26:42.644
What?
No band,

26:42.646 --> 26:43.979
no parade, no cake?

26:43.981 --> 26:46.148
Ooh.
Yes! Yes!

26:46.150 --> 26:47.416
Yes! Oh.

26:47.418 --> 26:48.750
Mm.

26:48.752 --> 26:50.118
You look great.
How are you? I'm good.

26:50.120 --> 26:51.286
I'm good, I'm good.
You look good.

26:51.288 --> 26:52.554
Thank you, thank you.
What's up, Deeks?

26:52.556 --> 26:55.023
Living the dream.
So good to see you.

26:55.025 --> 26:56.658
Yeah. Where's G?

26:56.660 --> 26:57.993
Oh, I'm just sorting
through applicants on my,

26:57.995 --> 26:59.561
uh, e-partner site.

26:59.563 --> 27:01.163
Oh, so I can leave?

27:01.165 --> 27:03.098
I mean, if you're here,
you might as well

27:03.100 --> 27:04.232
stay for the day, right?

27:04.234 --> 27:06.568
Welcome back, partner.

27:06.570 --> 27:09.137
Mm.

27:09.139 --> 27:10.872
So, what's this nonsense
I'm hearing about North Korea?

27:10.874 --> 27:12.541
Sam?

27:12.543 --> 27:14.309
Hey.
Hi. What's up?

27:14.311 --> 27:16.044
Hey, are we glad
to see you.

27:16.046 --> 27:18.547
Okay. Still awkward, I see.

27:18.549 --> 27:20.882
- What's the word?
- Okay.

27:20.884 --> 27:22.184
So, the computer
you recovered

27:22.186 --> 27:24.119
had extensive
security protocols

27:24.121 --> 27:26.655
that even Eric probably
wouldn't have been able

27:26.657 --> 27:29.024
to crack in several
days, if ever.

27:29.026 --> 27:30.692
I mean, I don't know
about "ever."

27:30.694 --> 27:32.361
Okay, nonetheless,

27:32.363 --> 27:34.029
the protocols were
corrupted by damage,

27:34.031 --> 27:36.398
which allowed Eric
access in.

27:36.400 --> 27:39.635
Unfortunately, everything
else was also corrupted.

27:39.637 --> 27:42.104
Now, we did find some
references to North Korea

27:42.106 --> 27:44.072
from an address that we
traced back to Iran.

27:44.074 --> 27:46.108
But, uh, couldn't
find much else.

27:46.110 --> 27:47.409
Iran has been helping
the hermit kingdom

27:47.411 --> 27:48.877
with their missile program.

27:48.879 --> 27:50.178
Some sources believe
they've been assisting

27:50.180 --> 27:52.614
North Korea with their
nuclear capabilities.

27:52.616 --> 27:54.549
Now, we've also found
what appear to be

27:54.551 --> 27:56.885
fragments of missile
schematics,

27:56.887 --> 27:59.721
as well as photographs
of Long Beach and San Pedro.

27:59.723 --> 28:02.057
Both make sense
as possible targets.

28:02.059 --> 28:04.126
What kind of warhead is that?

28:04.128 --> 28:05.260
It's not a missile.

28:05.262 --> 28:08.764
It's a conventional bomb.
A big one.

28:08.766 --> 28:10.032
Assistant Director Mosley

28:10.034 --> 28:11.566
is on the horn with SECNAV,

28:11.568 --> 28:12.734
and it's not good.

28:12.736 --> 28:14.736
In fact, it's
very, very bad.

28:16.373 --> 28:17.339
Please, let us...

28:17.341 --> 28:19.341
Oh, just...
There you go.

28:20.411 --> 28:22.577
Satellite photos confirm
North Korea is

28:22.579 --> 28:24.813
prepping an ICBM for launch.

28:24.815 --> 28:26.415
Okay,

28:26.417 --> 28:28.650
so if they do launch, how long
would it take to get here?

28:28.652 --> 28:29.918
If it could,

28:29.920 --> 28:31.887
it would take about
25 minutes to reach us.

28:31.889 --> 28:33.055
Well, that's not
gonna happen.

28:33.057 --> 28:34.456
We have no way of
knowing their ability

28:34.458 --> 28:37.125
to reach U.S. soil,
or the payload.

28:37.127 --> 28:39.127
The White House has
put all of our

28:39.129 --> 28:40.429
THAAD systems on high alert,

28:40.431 --> 28:43.398
along with carrier
strike group 11.

28:43.400 --> 28:45.967
Special Agent Hanna.

28:45.969 --> 28:48.570
EAD-PAC Mosley.

28:48.572 --> 28:50.906
Does your presence mean that
you're coming back to work?

28:50.908 --> 28:52.908
Well, under the circumstances,

28:52.910 --> 28:54.843
it doesn't seem like
I have much of a choice.

28:54.845 --> 28:57.279
What is the official word
from North Korea?

28:57.281 --> 28:58.580
Nothing.

28:58.582 --> 29:00.282
Pyongyang threatened

29:00.284 --> 29:01.917
a "super-mighty preemptive
strike" against the U.S.

29:01.919 --> 29:02.884
last April.

29:02.886 --> 29:04.486
That all tracks, but

29:04.488 --> 29:06.321
how does Iran
play into this?

29:06.323 --> 29:08.790
You thinking
what I'm thinking?

29:08.792 --> 29:11.793
Why build a bomb when
you've got a working missile?

29:11.795 --> 29:13.261
Timing is everything.

29:13.263 --> 29:15.130
Okay, guys,
we are headed

29:15.132 --> 29:17.532
towards an all-out
nuclear war.

29:17.534 --> 29:19.301
If you have information,
please, now's the time.

29:19.303 --> 29:21.336
What if it's
a bait and switch?

29:21.338 --> 29:23.371
Look, this missile launch

29:23.373 --> 29:25.173
was planned months ago.

29:25.175 --> 29:26.541
Yeah, they've launched
about 60 of them.

29:26.543 --> 29:27.876
Most of them end up
in the ocean,

29:27.878 --> 29:29.644
just like this one
probably will.

29:29.646 --> 29:32.147
But what if North
Korea launches a test missile,

29:32.149 --> 29:33.582
then, 22 minutes later,
a huge explosion

29:33.584 --> 29:35.717
rolls through
the Port of Los Angeles?

29:35.719 --> 29:37.285
North Korea would be framed.

29:37.287 --> 29:39.554
So you'd think that
they shot an ICBM...

29:39.556 --> 29:40.756
And then we would
discover the truth

29:40.758 --> 29:41.723
through satellite images
and forensics.

29:41.725 --> 29:44.659
But not before
we retaliated.

29:46.063 --> 29:47.696
No one wins if we go
to war with North Korea.

29:47.698 --> 29:51.066
Unless you live
on the other side of the world.

29:51.068 --> 29:52.300
Iran.

29:52.302 --> 29:54.102
We'd have to pull out
almost all of our troops

29:54.104 --> 29:56.371
in the Middle East if we
went to war with North Korea.

29:56.373 --> 29:59.040
Iran, ISIS, Al-Qaeda--

29:59.042 --> 30:00.809
they would all be unchecked.

30:00.811 --> 30:02.511
Okay, so how do we
find the bomb?

30:02.513 --> 30:05.847
Well, it'd be mobile.
In a truck or a van or...

30:07.484 --> 30:09.317
The EMT uniforms
at Lee's house.

30:09.319 --> 30:11.720
Ambulance would be
a perfect vehicle

30:11.722 --> 30:13.922
for delivery--
it could go anywhere.

30:13.924 --> 30:15.090
We're on it.
Let's go.

30:28.790 --> 30:30.323
Where are we?

30:30.325 --> 30:32.659
Kaleidoscope found an ambulance
on Ocean Boulevard

30:32.661 --> 30:34.561
with the same logo
as the EMT uniforms.

30:34.563 --> 30:37.697
Callen and Sam will
be there any minute.

30:37.699 --> 30:39.566
We've also identified
the second suspect.

30:39.568 --> 30:42.102
He entered the country
from South Korea

30:42.104 --> 30:45.572
on a German passport
as Herbert Dieter.

30:45.574 --> 30:47.707
But Agent Park's
case files suggest that he's

30:47.709 --> 30:50.577
Hebod Darvish,
a bomb maker for Hamas.

30:50.579 --> 30:52.879
We are closing in
on this, sir.

30:52.881 --> 30:55.014
So are we.
The USS <i>Nebraska</i> has been

30:55.016 --> 30:56.983
given a green light
to take out the missile site.

30:56.985 --> 30:58.718
Are we on open comms?

30:58.720 --> 31:00.220
Yes.
Yes, we are.

31:00.222 --> 31:02.455
<i>This situation</i>
<i>has just gone critical</i>

31:02.457 --> 31:05.291
<i>The USS</i> Nebraska
<i>is weapons hot.</i>

31:05.293 --> 31:06.626
What's your status?

31:06.628 --> 31:07.994
We have the ambulance in sight.

31:07.996 --> 31:09.395
Just waiting to move in.

31:09.397 --> 31:11.264
You are running out of time.

31:11.266 --> 31:13.133
There's too many
soft targets here.

31:13.135 --> 31:14.868
If he sees us coming
and decides to detonate early,

31:14.870 --> 31:16.069
there'll be mass casualties.

31:16.071 --> 31:17.871
He knows what Kensi and I
look like.

31:17.873 --> 31:20.774
Deeks, I think you're gonna have
to take one for the team here.

31:21.610 --> 31:24.010
Why do I think
this is gonna hurt?

31:32.387 --> 31:33.286
Ah, man.

31:33.288 --> 31:34.954
Are you okay?

31:34.956 --> 31:36.890
Somebody help him! Hey!

31:36.892 --> 31:39.292
Can you help me out?
This guy's really hurt.

31:39.294 --> 31:41.194
Turn off the engine.

31:41.196 --> 31:42.529
Now.

31:48.670 --> 31:49.903
Agent Callen,

31:49.905 --> 31:51.304
Agent Hanna, what's going on?

31:51.306 --> 31:52.972
We've neutralized
the target

31:52.974 --> 31:54.808
and secured the bomb.

31:55.577 --> 31:58.044
Sir, call off the strike.

31:58.046 --> 31:59.112
There is no threat.

31:59.114 --> 32:00.713
It's a hoax.

32:00.715 --> 32:02.382
There is no missile.

32:03.318 --> 32:05.151
Sir?

32:05.153 --> 32:06.319
Sir, do you hear me?

32:06.321 --> 32:08.621
Next time,
try not to cut it so close.

32:08.623 --> 32:09.989
Yes, sir.

32:11.726 --> 32:12.725
Think we got a problem.

32:12.727 --> 32:15.361
Define problem, Agent Callen.

32:15.363 --> 32:17.263
Well, the bomb is not nuclear,

32:17.265 --> 32:18.731
but it has been activated.

32:18.733 --> 32:20.500
Sam's trying to disarm it.

32:20.502 --> 32:21.501
How much time do we have?

32:21.503 --> 32:22.535
Sam?

32:22.537 --> 32:24.237
Not enough.

32:30.412 --> 32:31.711
Sorry.

32:43.525 --> 32:45.592
Sorry.

32:48.063 --> 32:49.362
Really?!

32:49.364 --> 32:51.497
Eric, we need a clear path
out of here.

32:51.499 --> 32:53.733
CHP, LAPD,
whatever you can do to get us

32:53.735 --> 32:54.767
a clear path.

32:54.769 --> 32:56.002
Yeah, yeah.
Where you gonna go?

32:56.004 --> 32:56.970
That's a good question.

32:56.972 --> 32:58.238
Sam, what's our blast radius?

32:58.240 --> 33:00.306
If this thing blows up,
they're gonna find pieces

33:00.308 --> 33:01.808
of you and me in Inglewood.

33:05.647 --> 33:06.946
What the hell, G?

33:06.948 --> 33:08.715
Sam, can you defuse it or not?

33:08.717 --> 33:10.550
Not if you keep driving
like that.

33:10.552 --> 33:12.352
Look, you want to drive,
be my guest.

33:12.354 --> 33:14.254
I would, except the only thing
worse than your driving

33:14.256 --> 33:16.122
is your bomb disposal skills.

33:17.926 --> 33:19.759
Seriously?!

33:19.761 --> 33:22.262
Okay, that was not intentional,
I swear.

33:22.264 --> 33:24.631
If this bomb doesn't kill you,
I'm going to.

33:24.633 --> 33:26.432
He didn't mean that.

33:26.434 --> 33:27.934
They're really
good friends.

33:27.936 --> 33:29.402
Most of the time.

33:29.404 --> 33:31.804
Okay, Callen,
CHP is going to

33:31.806 --> 33:33.273
try their best to coordinate

33:33.275 --> 33:35.575
with LAPD and the
sheriff's department

33:35.577 --> 33:38.578
to create a clear route
to the Long Beach Airport.

33:38.580 --> 33:41.281
The Long Beach Airport will then
divert all of their air traffic

33:41.283 --> 33:42.916
and give you a clear runway

33:42.918 --> 33:46.986
where fire and foam
rescue squads will meet you.

33:46.988 --> 33:48.788
How much time we got back there,
butterfingers?

33:48.790 --> 33:51.224
If I can bypass the timer,
we've got all day.

33:51.226 --> 33:52.358
And if you can't?

33:52.360 --> 33:54.727
We're not gonna
make the airport.

33:54.729 --> 33:56.663
Nice work, guys,

33:56.665 --> 33:58.498
but looks like we're gonna
have to go with plan B.

33:58.500 --> 34:00.066
Okay, what is plan B?

34:00.068 --> 34:03.069
"B" stands for "We better
come up with something fast."

34:03.939 --> 34:05.004
They're actually

34:05.006 --> 34:06.172
very good at this.

34:06.174 --> 34:07.774
Where the hell are they going?

34:07.776 --> 34:09.375
That's a good question.

34:15.984 --> 34:18.518
Son of a bitch!
What's wrong?

34:18.520 --> 34:21.020
What's wrong is I should've
stayed at the beach.

34:21.022 --> 34:22.889
And miss all this fun? Come on.

34:23.757 --> 34:25.458
I can't defuse it, G.

34:25.460 --> 34:26.826
Come on, it's easy.
Red wire, green wire.

34:26.828 --> 34:28.895
You pick one.
You got a 50-50 chance.

34:28.897 --> 34:31.230
This is why you're driving.

34:37.038 --> 34:38.705
I can't do this in time.

34:38.706 --> 34:40.840
Then hang on!

34:40.842 --> 34:42.108
<i>What do you mean, hang on?</i>

34:42.110 --> 34:43.141
<i>Hang on to what?</i>

34:43.143 --> 34:44.677
<i>All I got is a bomb back here!</i>

34:44.679 --> 34:47.547
<i>I'll pay for that.</i>

34:47.549 --> 34:49.514
G! What the hell was that?

34:49.516 --> 34:50.917
<i>G! What's the plan here?</i>

34:50.918 --> 34:52.351
G!

34:52.353 --> 34:54.219
Gentlemen, what's going on?
G!

34:54.222 --> 34:57.390
<i>Sorry, buddy,</i>
<i>this is gonna hurt!</i>

35:04.733 --> 35:05.965
You okay?

35:05.967 --> 35:07.166
No, I'm not okay.

35:07.168 --> 35:08.668
They don't have
seatbelts back here.

35:08.670 --> 35:10.069
You know what this
reminds me of?

35:10.071 --> 35:11.537
Could you please stop talking
so we could conserve

35:11.539 --> 35:12.905
the little air we have left?

35:12.907 --> 35:14.941
It's that submarine. Although,
this is a little smaller

35:14.943 --> 35:16.542
and we're not
getting shot at.

35:16.544 --> 35:18.644
Give me a sitrep, Agent Callen.

35:18.646 --> 35:20.680
Agent Hanna?

35:20.682 --> 35:22.448
Why aren't they answering?

35:22.450 --> 35:23.816
Get some eyes

35:23.818 --> 35:26.452
on their last location, Mr. Beale.
I'm trying.

35:26.454 --> 35:27.987
I knew this was a mistake.

35:27.989 --> 35:29.455
No, it's okay.

35:29.457 --> 35:31.290
Once it fills up with water,

35:31.292 --> 35:33.726
the pressure will equalize,
we'll be able to open the doors.

35:33.728 --> 35:35.495
Thanks for that, Mr. Wizard.

35:47.776 --> 35:48.808
Oh, no.

35:48.810 --> 35:51.511
I don't see them.

35:54.582 --> 35:56.516
There. Oh...

35:56.518 --> 35:58.184
You good?

35:59.087 --> 36:00.186
Yeah.

36:00.188 --> 36:01.254
They're okay.

36:01.256 --> 36:03.122
They drove the ambulance
into the harbor.

36:04.626 --> 36:07.427
They drove the ambulance
into the harbor?

36:08.863 --> 36:10.463
That's hardcore.

36:11.433 --> 36:13.066
Are you kidding me?

36:13.068 --> 36:15.968
Come on, you got to
admit that was fun.

36:15.970 --> 36:17.970
You would have missed all this.

36:17.972 --> 36:19.672
Not even close.

36:19.674 --> 36:20.940
You guys okay?

36:20.942 --> 36:22.675
Of course.
No.

36:22.677 --> 36:24.077
He's sour because

36:24.079 --> 36:27.680
I got to drive and he had
to... disconnect the bomb.

36:27.682 --> 36:29.282
I didn't disconnect
the bomb.

36:29.284 --> 36:30.616
What?

36:31.486 --> 36:33.019
Whoa!

36:33.021 --> 36:34.420
Oh!

36:34.422 --> 36:36.489
- All right!
- Nice.

36:36.491 --> 36:37.657
It's okay. We're-we're okay.

36:37.659 --> 36:39.125
A little wet.

36:39.127 --> 36:43.162
Pretty exciting first day, huh,
Assistant Director Mosley?

36:43.164 --> 36:45.431
Yes, very exciting.

36:45.433 --> 36:46.866
Beale, call SeaWorld.

36:46.868 --> 36:49.302
We're gonna need SeaWorld
on the scene.

36:49.304 --> 36:51.270
Excuse me.

36:55.877 --> 36:58.444
She doesn't really
like excitement.

36:58.446 --> 37:00.980
What does she like?

37:01.850 --> 37:03.683
I'm still trying to
figure that out.

37:03.685 --> 37:04.917
Hmm.

37:12.160 --> 37:14.060
You wanted to see me?

37:14.062 --> 37:17.396
I give credit where credit
is due, Agent Callen.

37:17.398 --> 37:19.499
You and your team prevented
what could have been

37:19.501 --> 37:21.400
a disastrous tragedy.

37:21.402 --> 37:23.169
Well, like I said, we have a...

37:23.171 --> 37:25.705
certain way of operating around
here that seems to work for us.

37:25.707 --> 37:28.107
I'm just not sure that
it works for this agency.

37:28.109 --> 37:30.076
When I said that your team

37:30.078 --> 37:31.844
could be better, I meant it.

37:31.846 --> 37:34.780
My definition of
a perfect mission

37:34.782 --> 37:37.550
is one where you achieve
all of your objectives

37:37.552 --> 37:39.252
without any casualties,

37:39.254 --> 37:41.220
civilian or otherwise.

37:41.222 --> 37:44.157
There is no such thing
as a perfect mission.

37:44.159 --> 37:45.491
Well, I disagree.

37:45.493 --> 37:46.659
And even if there isn't,

37:46.661 --> 37:49.495
that's no excuse
for not trying.

37:49.497 --> 37:52.231
Your unit has a reputation
for using lethal force

37:52.233 --> 37:53.833
far above and well beyond

37:53.835 --> 37:55.968
any other unit in this agency.

37:55.970 --> 37:58.004
Well, maybe our criminals here
on the West Coast

37:58.006 --> 37:59.605
are just little more dangerous.

37:59.607 --> 38:01.407
Or maybe it's time
you and your team

38:01.409 --> 38:03.409
start to take responsibility
for your actions.

38:04.245 --> 38:05.878
Gone are the days
where you

38:05.880 --> 38:09.148
shoot first
and ask questions later.

38:09.150 --> 38:11.717
That it?

38:11.719 --> 38:13.986
Yeah, that's it.

38:13.988 --> 38:16.455
Have a good night, Agent Callen.

38:16.457 --> 38:19.659
You, too.

38:25.533 --> 38:26.699
What was that about?

38:26.701 --> 38:28.201
Oh, she just wanted
to congratulate us

38:28.203 --> 38:29.669
on a job well done.

38:29.671 --> 38:31.837
So what does that
mean for me?

38:31.839 --> 38:33.506
You're back.

38:33.508 --> 38:35.641
For good?

38:36.811 --> 38:38.544
Working on that.

38:40.014 --> 38:41.981
What about you?

38:41.983 --> 38:44.116
This for good?

38:44.118 --> 38:45.651
If something happened
to this team

38:45.653 --> 38:48.754
and I wasn't there
to do everything I could?

38:48.756 --> 38:50.756
I don't think
I could live with that.

38:53.494 --> 38:56.262
Even if it was just Deeks.

38:59.367 --> 39:00.499
Aw!

39:00.501 --> 39:01.567
All right.

39:01.569 --> 39:02.935
That's it.

39:02.937 --> 39:04.036
Band's back together.

39:04.038 --> 39:05.738
Let's celebrate.

39:05.740 --> 39:06.539
Let's do it.

39:06.563 --> 39:08.208
Ah, I think I'm gonna
take a rain check.

39:08.209 --> 39:09.442
Oh.

39:09.444 --> 39:11.410
And just like that,
Dad ruins the party.

39:11.412 --> 39:12.912
I just want to
try and figure out

39:12.914 --> 39:14.380
what actually happened to Hetty.

39:18.186 --> 39:21.487
Hate to say it, G,
but I speak from experience;

39:21.489 --> 39:22.888
maybe she didn't
say where she was going

39:22.890 --> 39:25.424
because she doesn't
want to be found.

39:59.494 --> 40:00.660
You're late.

40:00.662 --> 40:04.397
I was delayed at the border.

40:06.301 --> 40:08.734
I am surprised they let you in.

40:08.736 --> 40:11.170
The club or the country?

40:12.774 --> 40:14.140
Both.

40:15.376 --> 40:16.575
I honestly

40:16.577 --> 40:19.979
did not think you'd
make it through customs.

40:19.981 --> 40:22.715
I didn't go through customs.

40:33.895 --> 40:36.462
You got any other photos?

40:36.464 --> 40:38.497
That's it.

40:38.499 --> 40:39.632
He's clearly American.

40:39.634 --> 40:42.234
Or Canadian,

40:42.236 --> 40:45.771
or Australian, or Swedish.

40:45.773 --> 40:47.373
Hmm.

40:47.375 --> 40:49.475
Well, he say he, uh...

40:49.477 --> 40:50.943
worked for the CIA.

40:50.945 --> 40:52.945
Crashed, uh,

40:52.947 --> 40:56.449
in a helicopter in 1976.

40:58.653 --> 41:00.753
That's when you went down.

41:00.755 --> 41:02.021
Right?

41:02.023 --> 41:04.990
Yes, but I was
the only survivor.

41:05.860 --> 41:07.827
You sure about that?

41:10.064 --> 41:12.231
You know the story
of Tho San?

41:12.233 --> 41:16.769
Some say he was
an American soldier

41:16.771 --> 41:21.040
who went native
during the war.

41:21.042 --> 41:22.074
Got a taste for killing.

41:22.076 --> 41:26.078
Spent the rest of his life
in the jungle

41:26.080 --> 41:28.581
hunting people.

41:28.583 --> 41:30.082
On both sides.

41:30.084 --> 41:35.454
I haven't come all this way
to hunt the bogeyman.

41:36.290 --> 41:41.227
Even if that man
is an American operative

41:41.229 --> 41:45.798
