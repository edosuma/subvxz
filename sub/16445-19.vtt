00:00.007 --> 00:01.085
<i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>

00:01.109 --> 00:03.373
THOMPKINS: Mario could've
lived a normal life.

00:03.398 --> 00:04.464
Jim didn't have to kill him.

00:04.499 --> 00:05.832
James Gordon is one of them.

00:05.882 --> 00:08.765
When I get out of here,
he'll be the first that I judge.

00:08.804 --> 00:09.964
BULLOCK: Now the Court's
readying a weapon

00:09.989 --> 00:12.038
- that could destroy the city.
- GORDON: It's the virus, I'm sure of it.

00:12.073 --> 00:15.508
KATHRYN: I have just discovered
someone has been deceiving me.

00:15.543 --> 00:17.528
I need you to kill him.

00:17.655 --> 00:19.528
TEMPLE SHAMAN: You've never
left that alley, Bruce.

00:19.583 --> 00:23.138
And for you to accept what
I have to teach, you need to.

00:23.185 --> 00:24.951
Selina, wait, this city has been judged.

00:24.986 --> 00:27.220
- You need to leave Gotham today.
- And why are you telling me?

00:27.255 --> 00:29.489
- Because I care about you.
- You're not even a real person.

00:29.524 --> 00:30.923
(Selina screams)

00:32.726 --> 00:33.957
IVY: You're awake!

00:34.051 --> 00:35.962
Selina, where are you going?

00:35.997 --> 00:37.230
To kill someone.

00:37.265 --> 00:39.399
What is this mysterious Court?

00:39.434 --> 00:42.802
OSWALD: Ed went on television,
and voilÃ , he disappears.

00:42.837 --> 00:45.238
- Oswald, drop it.
- No can do.

00:45.263 --> 00:47.130
- (gate slams shut)
- You cannot do this to me.

00:47.175 --> 00:50.042
I demand to speak to
the person in charge!

00:51.079 --> 00:52.945
Oswald.

00:58.381 --> 01:00.359
You're alive?

01:20.475 --> 01:22.515
How did you survive?

01:22.772 --> 01:24.671
In shooting me, Ed,

01:25.382 --> 01:27.976
you gave me something to live for:

01:29.584 --> 01:31.179
revenge.

01:31.868 --> 01:33.743
Yes...

01:34.486 --> 01:36.018
Unless...

01:38.726 --> 01:39.926
What?!

01:40.141 --> 01:41.661
Just making sure you're real.

01:41.722 --> 01:42.980
(groans)

01:43.026 --> 01:45.731
Wow, you are difficult to kill.

01:45.909 --> 01:47.700
More cockroach than penguin.

01:48.690 --> 01:51.070
But don't... you...

01:51.245 --> 01:53.670
dare call me "Ed."

01:54.256 --> 01:56.008
I'm...

01:56.295 --> 01:58.280
the Riddler.

01:58.561 --> 02:00.980
And I became him when I killed you.

02:02.217 --> 02:04.262
News flash, Ed!

02:04.486 --> 02:06.552
I'm not dead!

02:06.661 --> 02:08.425
(chuckles) That's true.

02:08.661 --> 02:10.455
For now.

02:11.505 --> 02:14.293
I came back from the dead
to kill you, Ed.

02:14.534 --> 02:16.896
And ended up a prisoner yourself.

02:19.307 --> 02:20.921
OSWALD: You really think a little steel

02:20.981 --> 02:22.995
and concrete is gonna stop me?

02:23.471 --> 02:24.704
The way I see it,

02:25.334 --> 02:27.521
I have you just where I want you.

02:27.976 --> 02:29.609
Perhaps.

02:31.479 --> 02:32.745
But not for long.

02:38.753 --> 02:41.687
(alarm beeping)

02:42.957 --> 02:44.590
(alarm shuts off)

02:54.035 --> 02:55.835
(Selina grunting)

02:57.338 --> 02:58.604
Selina.

03:00.488 --> 03:02.141
How?

03:02.347 --> 03:04.076
I came here to do one thing.

03:04.183 --> 03:05.878
And it ain't answering questions.

03:09.067 --> 03:11.317
Strange as it sounds,
I'm glad you're alive.

03:11.434 --> 03:13.598
That is strange.

03:13.731 --> 03:15.786
'Cause you pushed me
out a four-story window!

03:15.840 --> 03:17.356
(clattering, Bruce 2 grunts)

03:17.645 --> 03:19.887
What choice did I have?

03:20.014 --> 03:21.714
You were gonna tell Alfred about me.

03:21.796 --> 03:23.885
You mean how you're a freak?

03:24.032 --> 03:25.965
How you're just the cheap

03:26.000 --> 03:30.292
knock-off who kidnapped
the real Bruce Wayne?

03:31.139 --> 03:32.305
(both yell)

03:37.045 --> 03:38.010
(both grunt)

03:39.847 --> 03:41.013
- (Selina grunts)
- ALFRED: Selina!

03:41.883 --> 03:42.815
Selina, stop!

03:42.850 --> 03:44.720
- Stop!
- He's not Bruce!

03:44.923 --> 03:46.652
- Stop!
- He's not Bruce!

03:48.089 --> 03:50.489
Oh, dear God. Selina! Selina.

03:50.614 --> 03:52.207
She-She attacked me, Alfred.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.193
- She's out of her mind.
- She needs a doctor.

03:54.228 --> 03:56.295
You saw her, she... she was crazy.

03:56.843 --> 03:58.831
Put the iron down, Bruce.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.867
I said put the iron down!

04:02.708 --> 04:04.007
Alfred...

04:06.403 --> 04:07.773
You're cut.

04:10.700 --> 04:12.786
You don't feel a thing, do you?

04:13.216 --> 04:14.402
Do you?

04:14.567 --> 04:16.802
Now, I'm gonna ask you nicely,

04:17.208 --> 04:19.576
or I swear to God, you're gonna
feel a whole lot of pain.

04:20.208 --> 04:23.356
Where is Bruce?

04:24.450 --> 04:27.183
Bruce is serving
a greater purpose than himself.

04:28.753 --> 04:30.620
As am I. (grunts)

04:30.655 --> 04:31.688
(shouts)

04:31.723 --> 04:33.756
(grunting)

04:36.194 --> 04:37.803
Last time!

04:37.905 --> 04:40.196
Where is Bruce?

04:49.778 --> 04:52.249
You were always kind to me, Alfred.

04:53.036 --> 04:55.011
Even when you thought I wasn't Bruce.

04:57.212 --> 04:58.845
Please.

04:58.987 --> 05:00.249
Please.

05:00.987 --> 05:02.585
Just tell me where Bruce is.

05:02.621 --> 05:04.824
(grunts)

05:22.001 --> 05:24.201
Welcome home, Bruce.

05:45.431 --> 05:48.462
MARIO: Lee. Lee.

05:48.915 --> 05:50.466
Wake up.

05:55.473 --> 05:56.939
Mario.

05:57.596 --> 05:59.175
Are you okay?

06:03.040 --> 06:05.415
I was having the worst dream.

06:05.524 --> 06:07.724
Really? Tell me about it.

06:07.852 --> 06:11.314
God, there was this virus
that was loose in the city.

06:11.423 --> 06:13.932
It brought out a person's darkness,

06:13.994 --> 06:17.807
whatever they had buried inside
and you had it.

06:18.182 --> 06:19.783
Really?

06:20.119 --> 06:22.479
And what dark part of me
did it bring to light?

06:23.653 --> 06:26.122
You were jealous of Jim.

06:26.194 --> 06:27.336
(laughing): Come on.

06:27.372 --> 06:28.989
Me, jealous of Jim Gordon?

06:29.067 --> 06:31.641
- I'm sorry. You were.
- But I'm taller than he is.

06:32.710 --> 06:35.241
Hey. What is it?

06:35.680 --> 06:37.319
On our wedding night...

06:38.319 --> 06:39.949
he shot you.

06:41.073 --> 06:43.386
God, it was so real.

06:43.521 --> 06:45.441
I lost you.

06:45.597 --> 06:46.956
You didn't lose me.

06:47.316 --> 06:48.825
I'm right here.

06:49.253 --> 06:51.160
Now take your medicine

06:51.692 --> 06:53.075
and then off to bed.

07:06.913 --> 07:09.201
- I'm so sorry.
- I know.

07:09.765 --> 07:11.270
(distorted voice): Now drink.

07:15.344 --> 07:17.215
(gasps)

07:25.140 --> 07:26.623
Think about it, Harvey.

07:26.708 --> 07:28.786
The Court's been around
since the last century.

07:28.890 --> 07:30.322
It makes sense they
have secure locations,

07:30.358 --> 07:31.880
safe houses all across the city.

07:31.950 --> 07:33.457
And that's where
they're hiding the virus bomb?

07:33.482 --> 07:34.547
- Makes sense.
- Yeah.

07:34.572 --> 07:36.294
So I dug deeper into Kathryn's holdings.

07:36.319 --> 07:39.028
She owns a tenement building
near Miller Harbor.

07:39.738 --> 07:41.536
But there's a discrepancy

07:41.583 --> 07:43.876
between the square footage
listed in the city records

07:43.915 --> 07:46.439
and the blueprints...
over 2,000 square feet.

07:46.493 --> 07:48.423
You're saying they
got a secret room there.

07:48.470 --> 07:49.775
Okay, but by your logic,

07:49.829 --> 07:51.563
there could be dozens of secret
rooms throughout the city

07:51.612 --> 07:53.679
and the virus bomb could
be in any one of them.

07:54.260 --> 07:55.781
You're in the club now.

07:55.893 --> 07:57.297
This Kathryn broad trusts you.

07:57.362 --> 07:59.514
Why not just wait for her to call?

07:59.654 --> 08:01.687
Because if I can do it
quietly, she'll never know.

08:01.723 --> 08:03.770
And if the bomb is there,
I can end this.

08:03.795 --> 08:06.371
Okay, where in this building
is the secret room?

08:06.433 --> 08:08.360
- Lucius says the basement.
- Oh, Lucius says the basement.

08:08.396 --> 08:10.160
Then I guess we should
check out the basement.

08:10.215 --> 08:12.364
- What is your issue with him?
- He's smarter than me.

08:12.400 --> 08:13.769
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

08:17.588 --> 08:19.252
HARVEY: How come no one
ever hides something

08:19.315 --> 08:21.057
in a place I actually
would like to search?

08:21.119 --> 08:23.542
You know, like a brewery
or a strip joint.

08:23.596 --> 08:25.775
- Or a casino.
- Exactly.

08:26.013 --> 08:28.180
All I'm asking for is a little, uh...

08:28.282 --> 08:29.615
consideration.

08:29.938 --> 08:32.164
This is more like it.

08:33.289 --> 08:35.328
What's this?

08:37.926 --> 08:40.198
There's a crease in the wall.
Think it's a door.

08:40.254 --> 08:41.426
Let me hit the lights.

08:41.543 --> 08:43.801
Just need to find a way in.

08:47.056 --> 08:48.222
(chuckles)

08:48.257 --> 08:49.790
I meant to do that.

08:56.706 --> 08:58.617
Jeez.

09:00.093 --> 09:01.843
I don't see a bomb anywhere.

09:01.945 --> 09:04.271
Yeah. Why would it ever be easy?

09:06.546 --> 09:08.108
What's that?

09:08.242 --> 09:10.411
GORDON: Looks like an owl.

09:13.487 --> 09:14.615
Made out of...

09:16.276 --> 09:18.120
- ...crystal.
- Whoa.

09:18.393 --> 09:20.754
Whoa. It's Gotham.

09:21.924 --> 09:23.057
That must be us.

09:23.370 --> 09:24.992
That lower corner right there.

09:25.027 --> 09:26.227
Yeah.

09:26.323 --> 09:28.073
What do you think the white markers are?

09:29.296 --> 09:32.015
- Secret locations of the Court?
- Makes sense.

09:32.148 --> 09:33.934
If so, that could be where the bomb is.

09:33.970 --> 09:35.135
(glass shatters)

09:35.171 --> 09:36.670
(metal clinking, beeping)

09:36.824 --> 09:39.006
- Holy mother of saints!
- Down!

09:47.415 --> 09:49.360
I see you haven't lost a step, Jim.

09:52.407 --> 09:54.345
Can't say the same for Bullock.

10:01.442 --> 10:04.692
Remember I promised you'd
be punished for your crimes?

10:05.059 --> 10:07.334
Well, I've come here
to keep that promise.

10:12.012 --> 10:15.488
No, I said Gordon. Detective Jim Gordon.

10:16.426 --> 10:17.869
Well, have him call me

10:17.894 --> 10:19.590
the minute he gets this message,
all right, you nancy?

10:24.144 --> 10:26.007
You should see a doctor.

10:26.149 --> 10:27.618
Mm-mm.

10:27.734 --> 10:29.773
Fine, whatever. Listen.

10:29.845 --> 10:32.746
Think. Can you remember anything else?

10:32.859 --> 10:34.681
Only what I already told you, Alfred.

10:34.984 --> 10:36.404
The clone came to me.

10:36.441 --> 10:39.353
Talking about how Gotham's
gonna be judged

10:40.129 --> 10:42.049
and a lot of people are gonna die.

10:43.182 --> 10:45.080
It's the bloody Court of Owls, isn't it?

10:45.194 --> 10:47.594
Mm-hmm. I warned you.

10:47.697 --> 10:50.697
Warned you what would happen
if you poked the tiger.

10:50.725 --> 10:52.257
What, do you want a medal, dear?

10:52.343 --> 10:54.635
All that matters is they've got Bruce.

10:54.670 --> 10:57.423
- Wait, you think he's still alive?
- My boy is still alive!

10:58.514 --> 11:02.408
And you... you are
gonna help me find him.

11:04.142 --> 11:07.064
- No, I'm not.
- Oh, don't-don't do that.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.883
Then what? You're still angry with Bruce

11:09.919 --> 11:12.185
'cause he never told you
your mom was a wonky con artist?

11:12.544 --> 11:14.348
That boy has been loyal to you;

11:14.403 --> 11:16.458
he's been good; he's been a friend,

11:16.518 --> 11:18.825
and now he's in trouble
you're not gonna lift a finger?!

11:20.270 --> 11:22.581
I don't know what good it'll do me.

11:24.612 --> 11:25.866
You're a disgrace.

11:25.901 --> 11:27.701
(scoffs)

11:27.761 --> 11:29.069
You're like your mum.

11:30.480 --> 11:32.115
Go on then.

11:32.241 --> 11:34.170
Run away.

11:34.410 --> 11:37.842
And don't you ever come back here.

11:46.364 --> 11:48.855
I-I'm good, thanks. I'm good.

11:49.337 --> 11:50.603
Bullock,

11:50.728 --> 11:52.901
got a kid who saw Barnes flee the scene.

11:52.924 --> 11:53.992
All right, kid, talk.

11:54.017 --> 11:57.531
I saw some guy in leather,
had an axe attached to his arm,

11:57.643 --> 11:59.199
drove off in some delivery truck.

11:59.261 --> 12:01.368
- What kind?
- For chopping stuff.

12:01.456 --> 12:04.404
- What kind of truck?
- BOY: Oh, right.

12:04.995 --> 12:06.498
Genovese Meats.

12:06.575 --> 12:07.941
Put a BOLO out on that truck.

12:08.530 --> 12:09.910
Barnes has Jim.

12:10.280 --> 12:11.812
He's taken him somewhere.

12:16.418 --> 12:19.520
(laughs)

12:19.660 --> 12:21.637
You're making your blade too thin.

12:21.888 --> 12:24.036
It's gonna snap off
when you try to stab me.

12:24.465 --> 12:27.732
Well, we'll soon find out,
won't we, Edward?

12:29.141 --> 12:31.267
I told you not to call me that.

12:34.469 --> 12:36.712
What? Edward?

12:37.618 --> 12:40.376
But that's your name, Edward.

12:40.922 --> 12:44.295
Edward. Edward, Edward, Edward,
Edward, Edward, Edward, Edward...

12:44.342 --> 12:45.274
Enough!

12:46.241 --> 12:48.170
You're pathetic, you know that?

12:48.600 --> 12:50.591
At least I'm in here

12:50.972 --> 12:55.092
because I was trying
to figure out who runs Gotham.

12:56.060 --> 12:57.786
You're here because what?

12:58.137 --> 13:00.246
I didn't love you back?

13:02.934 --> 13:04.567
Get over it.

13:10.966 --> 13:14.397
No. You did not love me back,

13:14.845 --> 13:16.564
but that's not why I'm here.

13:17.052 --> 13:20.347
I'm here because you destroyed
the empire I built.

13:20.795 --> 13:23.144
- I'm here because you shot me.
- (chuckles)

13:23.251 --> 13:26.152
And no one does what you did and lives.

13:26.500 --> 13:29.923
Well, good luck exacting revenge
when I'm gone.

13:30.673 --> 13:32.189
Oh, please.

13:32.501 --> 13:34.379
Make one move to escape
and I call the guards.

13:35.050 --> 13:37.566
Ah, I assumed as much,

13:37.995 --> 13:40.272
which is why I bribed the guards
to poison your coffee.

13:40.347 --> 13:41.780
(gags)

13:41.816 --> 13:42.881
(laughs)

13:43.733 --> 13:45.716
- You're lying!
- Yes, I am,

13:45.741 --> 13:48.220
but I did steal a dart

13:48.303 --> 13:49.988
from the guards a couple days ago.

13:50.024 --> 13:52.159
Was planning on using it on them, but...

13:54.010 --> 13:55.027
Ow!

13:55.062 --> 13:56.428
(laughing)

13:59.679 --> 14:02.849
You're gonna have to do
a lot better than that...

14:03.673 --> 14:05.317
Ooh.

14:07.771 --> 14:08.997
Help.

14:09.076 --> 14:10.342
(Oswald chokes)

14:10.427 --> 14:12.444
(choking): Help. Help.

14:16.877 --> 14:18.050
Hey!

14:18.330 --> 14:21.353
What are you doing? Stop that! Stop!

14:22.790 --> 14:24.556
Okay. Come on, come on.

14:27.165 --> 14:29.040
Stop that.

14:29.263 --> 14:30.562
- Stop it!
- What are you doing?

14:30.602 --> 14:32.498
No, no, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

14:32.533 --> 14:34.533
(Nygma shouting and grunting)

14:40.070 --> 14:43.070
I shall set you free, Bruce,

14:43.336 --> 14:48.615
free from the blinding rage
of your darkest memory.

14:49.162 --> 14:53.061
There is one final step to take.

14:54.452 --> 14:56.555
My parents' murder.

14:58.069 --> 15:00.608
You want to take away
the pain of that night.

15:00.751 --> 15:02.171
Yes.

15:15.202 --> 15:17.491
But you must be willing.

15:18.163 --> 15:21.632
I cannot take what you will not give.

15:26.148 --> 15:27.819
My mother's pearls.

15:28.335 --> 15:31.757
Lock them away and be free of the pain.

15:32.757 --> 15:34.952
Become strong.

15:35.605 --> 15:38.630
Become the protector Gotham needs.

15:51.011 --> 15:53.011
âª âª

16:07.294 --> 16:09.053
I'm sorry.

16:09.663 --> 16:13.881
I want to. I... I just can't. I-I can't.

16:14.740 --> 16:17.264
Then I think it's time...

16:17.569 --> 16:19.855
I told you the truth.

16:31.987 --> 16:34.050
You made a fool of me, Jim.

16:35.815 --> 16:37.222
It's a shame.

16:38.456 --> 16:40.818
I had such high hopes.

16:42.036 --> 16:45.079
You could've played a pivotal
role in Gotham's future.

16:45.389 --> 16:46.498
Listen to me...

16:46.533 --> 16:50.123
Don't insult me further by lying.

16:50.631 --> 16:55.088
I know you took my key card
to Professor Strange's lab.

16:55.419 --> 16:58.174
Odd that Strange said nothing.

16:59.346 --> 17:01.639
He and I will be having words.

17:02.186 --> 17:04.883
Who else have you brought
into your confidence?

17:04.917 --> 17:08.592
- Harvey Bullock, obviously.
- What is this, an exit interview?

17:09.865 --> 17:11.417
If you like.

17:12.253 --> 17:14.760
Who else have you spoken to?

17:16.262 --> 17:18.644
Who else have you spoken to?

17:18.699 --> 17:20.898
GORDON: The Court ordered
my father murdered.

17:21.167 --> 17:23.773
You drove my uncle to suicide.

17:24.181 --> 17:26.220
You can go to hell.

17:27.297 --> 17:29.392
And what are you now, their lapdog?

17:30.134 --> 17:31.543
I know you're a lunatic.

17:31.578 --> 17:33.135
At least you used
to stand for something.

17:33.220 --> 17:37.525
KATHRYN: Your attempts to turn Captain
Barnes against me are tiresome.

17:38.886 --> 17:41.286
He was following you not because

17:41.322 --> 17:43.546
I asked him to, but because he knows,

17:43.663 --> 17:45.460
as I do...

17:45.726 --> 17:48.927
that you are an enemy of Gotham.

17:53.040 --> 17:55.618
You Gordons always were stubborn.

17:56.767 --> 17:58.937
But I am sad you won't see the end

17:58.972 --> 18:03.898
of our little story,
when the clock stops...

18:04.828 --> 18:07.008
and Gotham falls.

18:12.574 --> 18:14.339
Captain.

18:15.253 --> 18:17.058
He's all yours.

18:23.481 --> 18:25.090
BARNES: Let the record
show that the trial

18:25.115 --> 18:27.256
of James Gordon has begun.

18:27.865 --> 18:32.422
Nathaniel Barnes
presiding as judge, jury

18:33.008 --> 18:35.164
and executioner.

18:40.067 --> 18:44.191
Twinkle, twinkle, pretty doctor,
how I wish I could unlock her.

18:44.504 --> 18:47.167
Here in Arkham, what a wonder.

18:47.799 --> 18:50.057
Too bad her husband's six feet under.

18:50.596 --> 18:52.128
Clever.

18:52.456 --> 18:57.107
- How is life in the nuthouse?
- Oh, you know, it has its ups and downs.

18:57.912 --> 18:59.351
Forgive me

18:59.427 --> 19:01.022
for saying this, Leslie, dear,

19:01.080 --> 19:04.381
but, uh, you don't look yourself.

19:04.658 --> 19:06.671
Have you been sleeping?

19:07.038 --> 19:09.866
Or are you plagued by nightmares?

19:09.991 --> 19:12.057
You want to hear
the funny thing, Jervis?

19:12.101 --> 19:14.448
Oh, do tell. I do so love funny things.

19:14.541 --> 19:17.541
I never really blamed you
for infecting Mario.

19:17.783 --> 19:20.768
I just thought, "Why blame the lunatic?"

19:21.182 --> 19:22.386
So I blamed Jim.

19:22.550 --> 19:24.035
Wise...

19:24.207 --> 19:26.911
though hardly sidesplittingly funny.

19:27.105 --> 19:30.074
Why did you infect him?

19:30.191 --> 19:35.253
Oh, Doctor, is that the question
that's been ruining your sleep?

19:35.288 --> 19:37.589
You wanted to hurt Jim.
Why not infect me?

19:38.024 --> 19:40.345
Why make Mario suffer?

19:41.352 --> 19:45.686
Do you remember our tea
party at your lovely home?

19:46.014 --> 19:47.832
When you shot Valerie Vale.

19:47.868 --> 19:49.865
Yes! Good memory.

19:49.967 --> 19:54.309
Well, I saw the way that
you looked at James Gordon.

19:54.739 --> 19:56.274
You loved him.

19:57.121 --> 20:00.606
And that love doomed Mario.

20:02.442 --> 20:03.673
That doesn't make sense.

20:03.717 --> 20:05.215
It makes perfect sense!

20:05.240 --> 20:06.951
Jim Gordon does not deserve love!

20:06.987 --> 20:09.021
Jim Gordon does not get love!

20:09.514 --> 20:11.356
I infect your husband.

20:12.671 --> 20:14.793
You blame Jim.

20:15.514 --> 20:18.063
Your love for him becomes hate.

20:18.671 --> 20:23.301
It makes perfect sense.

20:25.338 --> 20:27.122
And it worked.

20:27.574 --> 20:29.724
But you know the funny thing?

20:30.192 --> 20:33.423
There's poor Mario,

20:33.680 --> 20:35.775
cold in the ground...

20:36.420 --> 20:40.954
and here you are,
blaming Jim, even blaming me,

20:41.021 --> 20:44.782
but guess who's really to blame?

20:47.461 --> 20:49.063
I am.

20:49.963 --> 20:53.162
Now, see, that's funny.

21:02.976 --> 21:04.976
(groans)

21:13.202 --> 21:16.600
My lockpick was confiscated!

21:16.855 --> 21:18.045
(groans)

21:18.147 --> 21:22.333
Now we're both stuck in this
unnaturally damp hellhole.

21:22.413 --> 21:23.926
I hope you're happy.

21:23.997 --> 21:25.930
Did the guards club you?

21:26.957 --> 21:28.509
You know they did.

21:28.742 --> 21:30.535
Then I'm happy.

21:33.367 --> 21:35.179
Why are our captors
keeping us here, anyway?

21:35.234 --> 21:37.107
- Why not simply kill us?
- I don't know.

21:38.029 --> 21:42.177
Since my first meeting...
with some woman named Kathryn,

21:42.247 --> 21:44.826
I've had no contact
with upper management.

21:45.318 --> 21:46.231
But...

21:46.451 --> 21:48.017
according to the guards' gossip,

21:48.522 --> 21:50.888
Court's planning
some attack on the city.

21:51.701 --> 21:53.458
Fine.

21:54.194 --> 21:56.027
(grunts)

21:57.343 --> 21:59.364
You want to kill me, I want to kill you.

21:59.929 --> 22:02.890
But being locked in these cages
does neither of us any good.

22:04.981 --> 22:06.865
We have to escape.

22:08.121 --> 22:10.175
There's only one way
that's gonna happen.

22:11.692 --> 22:12.996
We work together.

22:14.482 --> 22:16.443
There have to be rules.

22:16.537 --> 22:19.483
- No sabotage.
- Of course.

22:20.218 --> 22:22.251
And no murder on the premises.

22:22.303 --> 22:23.482
Agreed.

22:23.537 --> 22:26.149
Also, there needs to be
a six-hour window, post-escape.

22:26.219 --> 22:27.624
If I get outside
and I'm worrying about you

22:27.649 --> 22:29.477
stabbing my neck,
I won't be able to concentrate,

22:29.555 --> 22:30.961
and that's not good.

22:31.024 --> 22:33.723
Agreed, reluctantly.

22:34.309 --> 22:37.512
Then we help
each other escape, together,

22:38.668 --> 22:42.270
so that we may be free
to murder each other outside.

22:47.591 --> 22:49.184
Deal.

22:55.649 --> 22:57.641
What are you going to show me?

22:58.021 --> 23:00.360
The truth, Bruce.

23:02.188 --> 23:03.962
My truth.

23:24.453 --> 23:26.094
This isn't one of my memories.

23:28.930 --> 23:30.907
It's one of yours.

23:31.297 --> 23:32.620
MAN: We had no choice.

23:32.714 --> 23:34.987
The laws are clear. And you were gone.

23:35.073 --> 23:39.370
Thomas and Martha Wayne
were leaders of Gotham.

23:39.440 --> 23:42.363
The city honored them. I honored them.

23:42.399 --> 23:43.896
He threatened exposure.

23:44.029 --> 23:46.240
What of their boy, Bruce?

23:46.477 --> 23:48.236
Their son.

23:49.126 --> 23:52.606
- He was not harmed.
- That, at least, is something.

23:54.077 --> 23:56.387
(choking, gargling)

23:56.668 --> 23:58.683
All this time, Bruce,

23:58.738 --> 24:02.116
the Court was never more
than a means to an end,

24:02.542 --> 24:05.824
allowing us to maintain order in Gotham.

24:06.824 --> 24:08.370
Us?

24:09.834 --> 24:11.561
Who are you?

24:11.639 --> 24:15.123
Mm. One thing at a time, Bruce.

24:15.451 --> 24:19.127
The point is, the Court's day is over.

24:19.346 --> 24:22.713
And they must finally
pay for their crimes.

24:22.892 --> 24:24.358
My parents' murder.

24:24.556 --> 24:26.017
Exactly.

24:26.799 --> 24:29.502
This is your chance, Bruce.

24:30.002 --> 24:31.822
Will you help me?

24:46.149 --> 24:48.363
Things could've gone
so differently, James.

24:51.747 --> 24:54.279
We could've cleaned
this town up together.

24:55.046 --> 24:57.912
But when the moment came,
you stood against me.

24:57.974 --> 25:01.185
You stood against Gotham.
Against justice.

25:03.037 --> 25:05.014
- How do you plead?
- If you're asking

25:05.029 --> 25:08.620
did I shoot your crazy ass and
send you to Arkham, then, yeah.

25:08.918 --> 25:10.394
I'm guilty.

25:11.097 --> 25:13.821
The sentence is death by beheading.

25:14.580 --> 25:16.611
To be carried out immediately.

25:18.206 --> 25:19.901
You do know your new masters

25:19.956 --> 25:23.082
are nothing but a pack
of murderers, don't you?

25:23.745 --> 25:26.367
They're gonna unleash the virus
in a mass attack.

25:26.699 --> 25:29.556
Infecting both the
innocent and the guilty.

25:32.587 --> 25:36.040
You still think this virus is a curse?

25:36.775 --> 25:38.134
Tell me.

25:38.759 --> 25:42.407
What about strength is a curse?

25:42.786 --> 25:46.141
What about clarity is a curse?

25:47.789 --> 25:50.196
You're just like Lee Thompkins.

25:50.641 --> 25:52.368
What are you talking about?

25:52.448 --> 25:56.617
She came to me, just after you
blew her husband away.

25:56.933 --> 25:59.391
She wanted to know
if he would've killed her.

25:59.477 --> 26:02.602
I told her that the virus is a gift.

26:03.773 --> 26:06.174
Just like you, she didn't understand.

26:06.813 --> 26:08.703
If she did come to you,

26:09.274 --> 26:10.875
the only thing she took away

26:11.102 --> 26:14.266
is that Mario was totally
and completely insane.

26:18.176 --> 26:20.168
Any last requests?

26:20.723 --> 26:22.410
Yes!

26:22.792 --> 26:24.225
My badge.

26:26.145 --> 26:27.654
If I'm gonna die,

26:27.936 --> 26:29.857
I want to die wearing it.

26:30.147 --> 26:31.811
I deserve that.

26:32.269 --> 26:34.236
One soldier to another.

26:34.904 --> 26:36.904
(blade whirs)

26:38.178 --> 26:40.670
One soldier to another.

26:50.954 --> 26:52.620
(beeping)

26:52.655 --> 26:54.222
Fire in the hole, Captain.

26:54.257 --> 26:55.957
(rapid beeping)

26:58.170 --> 26:59.228
You fool!

26:59.303 --> 27:00.560
James Gordon.

27:00.630 --> 27:02.404
- I hereby...
- (door opens)

27:02.457 --> 27:04.787
- Don't move!
- Stop right there!

27:05.192 --> 27:06.701
(gunshots)

27:11.722 --> 27:14.222
- I got you, buddy.
- OFFICER: He's running!

27:24.449 --> 27:26.215
Alvarez. Any word on Barnes?

27:26.297 --> 27:27.745
- Nothing yet.
- (groans)

27:27.802 --> 27:31.071
There's a nutjob running around
in a leather jumpsuit

27:31.153 --> 27:32.405
with an axe for an arm!

27:32.440 --> 27:35.478
Now I know this is Gotham,
but come on, people, do something!

27:35.681 --> 27:36.954
Jim.

27:37.045 --> 27:38.704
I'm heading over to Kathryn's townhouse.

27:38.922 --> 27:41.113
Maybe I can get there
before she realizes I escaped.

27:41.633 --> 27:43.142
In case I run into Barnes.

27:43.217 --> 27:44.684
(phone vibrating)

27:44.719 --> 27:45.766
This is Bullock.

27:45.820 --> 27:47.149
What?

27:47.221 --> 27:49.929
Yes. Yes. Thank you.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.445
That was O'Toole.
Strike Force beat you to it.

27:52.492 --> 27:55.561
They're bringing Kathryn in now.
Finally some freaking good news, right?

27:55.694 --> 27:56.976
ALFRED: Gordon!

27:58.281 --> 28:00.594
Where the bloody hell have you been?
I've been trying to call you all day.

28:00.664 --> 28:02.068
Alfred. What's happened?

28:02.297 --> 28:05.234
It's Bruce. He's been abducted.

28:05.340 --> 28:08.903
Oh, why? Why can't anything be easy?

28:09.442 --> 28:12.263
Don't know how,
but he's definitely gone.

28:12.325 --> 28:14.857
And you're not gonna believe this,
but the people responsible

28:14.911 --> 28:17.152
are this shadowy organization
that run the whole of Gotham,

28:17.210 --> 28:19.324
- they're, they're called...
- The Court of Owls.

28:22.878 --> 28:24.933
GORDON: We've been
investigating the Court

28:24.972 --> 28:27.151
and a woman named
Kathryn Monroe for months now.

28:27.209 --> 28:29.051
Until this morning,
I was working undercover

28:29.099 --> 28:30.216
inside the organization.

28:30.285 --> 28:31.439
Did they ever mention Bruce?

28:31.478 --> 28:33.299
Never. Why would they want
to kidnap him?

28:33.970 --> 28:36.041
Well, we might've had a, a bit of a,

28:36.096 --> 28:37.737
a run-in early on in the year.

28:37.772 --> 28:40.282
- How long has he been gone?
- I don't know.

28:40.608 --> 28:42.153
Could be several days, several weeks.

28:42.178 --> 28:43.840
Weeks? How can the kid
be missing for weeks?

28:43.879 --> 28:46.178
- That's your one freaking job.
- Don't you think I know that?

28:46.332 --> 28:47.744
They replaced him, all right?

28:47.791 --> 28:51.383
With a... with an exact clone,
created in Indian Hill.

28:51.408 --> 28:54.863
H-Hold on a second. Wait, back up,
I-I thought I heard you say "clone."

28:55.113 --> 28:56.922
That's 'cause I did.

28:58.113 --> 28:59.660
I got to sit down.

28:59.774 --> 29:02.027
GORDON: All right. Let's think
this through. Alfred.

29:02.094 --> 29:03.735
Is there anything
you and Bruce could've done

29:03.782 --> 29:05.465
that would've drawn attention
from the Court?

29:05.520 --> 29:08.902
Well, we did break in
to one of their houses

29:09.512 --> 29:11.885
to try and find something
to give us leverage against the Court,

29:11.917 --> 29:16.277
and all we found was this ridiculous...
crystal owl thingamajig

29:16.317 --> 29:19.170
- which I managed to break.
- Crystal owl?

29:19.215 --> 29:21.068
Is there any way it
could be reassembled?

29:22.078 --> 29:24.325
- Why?
- We found another owl this morning.

29:24.350 --> 29:27.692
When you shine a light through it,
a map of Gotham appears.

29:27.731 --> 29:30.606
We think this map indicates the
secret hideouts of the Court.

29:30.684 --> 29:32.287
So Bruce could be in one
of those hideouts, right?

29:32.951 --> 29:34.271
So where's your bloody owl?

29:34.311 --> 29:36.990
Uh, well, due to circumstances
totally beyond our control,

29:37.709 --> 29:39.168
the owl went kaboom.

29:39.333 --> 29:41.871
But if we could reassemble
the owl that you stole,

29:41.965 --> 29:44.285
maybe we could find Bruce and the bomb.

29:45.422 --> 29:46.793
Do you still have the pieces?

29:46.848 --> 29:48.113
You're having a laugh, ain't you?

29:48.176 --> 29:49.271
After all the bloody trouble

29:49.296 --> 29:50.592
I went through to get it,
of course I do.

29:50.627 --> 29:52.126
Right. I'll be back in a minute.

29:52.162 --> 29:53.394
(door opens)

29:55.009 --> 29:57.330
Help!

29:57.642 --> 29:59.486
Help!

29:59.511 --> 30:00.802
NYGMA: Let me out of here,

30:00.837 --> 30:03.150
- or I kill him! Now!
- GUARD: Easy.

30:03.196 --> 30:05.234
What are you doing? Open my cell!

30:06.269 --> 30:08.269
Shoot him! What are you waiting for?

30:08.345 --> 30:09.444
Never mind.

30:09.479 --> 30:11.646
(choking)

30:14.603 --> 30:16.403
Back. Get back.

30:16.620 --> 30:18.052
(exhales)

30:18.107 --> 30:20.061
Wait. Is that Jell-O?

30:20.131 --> 30:22.029
- Surprise.
- (grunts)

30:26.296 --> 30:29.097
(laughs)

30:32.266 --> 30:34.789
Your death scene was quite convincing.

30:34.971 --> 30:38.273
Well. I've had some practice, haven't I?

30:43.465 --> 30:45.308
All right, if you see
anything, let me know, okay?

30:45.333 --> 30:46.464
Yeah. You got it.

30:51.138 --> 30:52.716
Detective Gordon.

30:53.490 --> 30:56.122
I suppose I really shouldn't
be surprised.

30:56.216 --> 30:57.292
No, you shouldn't.

30:57.537 --> 30:59.049
Put her in the box.

31:00.370 --> 31:01.948
GORDON: I've seen the map.

31:02.354 --> 31:05.073
I know the Court has secret
locations across the city.

31:05.557 --> 31:07.229
Where are you hiding the bomb?

31:07.845 --> 31:09.541
What bomb?

31:13.047 --> 31:15.752
What does Bruce Wayne
have to do with all of this?

31:16.037 --> 31:18.023
Why did you kidnap him?

31:18.706 --> 31:21.643
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

31:21.985 --> 31:24.260
They're not all powerful, you know.

31:24.628 --> 31:27.628
The Court, they can't keep you safe.

31:27.800 --> 31:29.525
Besides, what are the members gonna think

31:29.550 --> 31:31.597
when they see their leader behind bars?

31:32.440 --> 31:34.980
You think I'm the leader?

31:36.472 --> 31:38.084
All this time,

31:38.123 --> 31:42.280
and you really
don't know anything, do you?

31:47.277 --> 31:49.085
ALFRED: Right.

31:49.593 --> 31:51.367
Here we go.

31:52.233 --> 31:54.108
Wait, this is the owl? What
the hell happened to it?

31:54.162 --> 31:57.842
Jerome Valeska smashed it to bits
when he broke into the Manor, didn't he?

31:58.061 --> 31:59.354
Can you put it back together again?

31:59.389 --> 32:01.022
I can't even do a jigsaw puzzle.

32:01.057 --> 32:03.934
I just smash the pieces
in with my fists till they fit.

32:04.027 --> 32:05.716
But wait a second, we
have, we have a guy here

32:05.756 --> 32:08.329
who makes molds of murder
victims' faces out of clay.

32:08.381 --> 32:10.373
- I'll give him a call.
- All right.

32:10.951 --> 32:12.459
Where's Gordon?

32:12.515 --> 32:14.662
He's interrogating Kathryn Monroe.

32:15.238 --> 32:17.064
The woman from the Court of Owls?

32:17.111 --> 32:18.376
Yeah.

32:18.441 --> 32:20.540
- Right...
- I mean, no! No.

32:20.595 --> 32:23.892
Not the woman from the Court of Owls!
Oh, God, no. Not her.

32:23.980 --> 32:25.384
Right.

32:25.448 --> 32:27.337
Tell me where Bruce Wayne is,

32:27.391 --> 32:28.883
or I guarantee you'll regret it.

32:28.918 --> 32:30.251
Alfred, I've got this.

32:30.286 --> 32:32.344
Good cop, bad cop.

32:32.399 --> 32:35.360
That routine's a bit tired,
isn't it, gentlemen?

32:36.274 --> 32:38.393
Yeah, but I'm not a cop.

32:38.475 --> 32:39.861
Am I?

32:39.896 --> 32:42.444
(screams)

32:42.469 --> 32:44.102
I'm a butler.

32:46.569 --> 32:49.270
(crashing, banging noises approach)

32:49.305 --> 32:50.772
(screams)

32:50.894 --> 32:53.238
Ladies and gentlemen...

32:53.300 --> 32:54.776
- Who is this guy?
- (all murmuring nervously)

32:56.606 --> 32:59.014
- (gas hissing)
- Court is now in session.

33:00.150 --> 33:03.284
(scattered screaming)

33:06.326 --> 33:08.493
GORDON: Alfred? Alfred!

33:08.594 --> 33:10.489
- Alfred, that's enough.
- Is he out of his freaking mind?

33:10.536 --> 33:12.747
- It's his play.
- Now, you tell me where Bruce Wayne is,

33:12.810 --> 33:15.286
you evil old trout, or I will gut you!

33:16.135 --> 33:18.302
Or maybe I should try the other hand.

33:19.770 --> 33:21.254
- Alfred...
- (distant explosion)

33:22.169 --> 33:23.843
- (screaming upstairs)
- What the hell's going on?

33:23.960 --> 33:25.626
(distant explosion)

33:31.650 --> 33:33.116
(man grunts)

33:35.120 --> 33:36.520
(Barnes yells)

33:37.823 --> 33:39.690
(yells)

33:42.520 --> 33:43.619
Damn.

33:43.661 --> 33:45.583
- GORDON: Easy, easy!
- All right, I'm all right.

33:45.653 --> 33:47.364
Hey, hey, you two, stop it right now.

33:47.466 --> 33:48.762
- (door closes)
- We got a bigger problem.

33:48.834 --> 33:51.001
Barnes is out there.
He tore up the precinct,

33:51.051 --> 33:52.489
used some kind of knockout gas.

33:52.528 --> 33:55.439
I got to get you and her
out of here right now. Let's go!

33:55.541 --> 33:57.253
- Take her.
- Get up. Up!

34:00.980 --> 34:02.980
(gas hissing)

34:04.850 --> 34:05.882
Where is he?

34:06.018 --> 34:07.674
I don't know.

34:08.353 --> 34:09.745
BARNES (echoing): You.

34:09.844 --> 34:11.978
You corrupted this house.

34:12.088 --> 34:14.159
All of you, with your weakness,

34:14.246 --> 34:16.167
your compromise.

34:16.226 --> 34:19.108
This place was a church to me.

34:19.241 --> 34:20.739
All right, that's enough of this.

34:20.824 --> 34:23.391
Bullock, you and Alfred take Kathryn
out through the garage.

34:23.484 --> 34:25.150
I'm not leaving you alone with him.

34:25.284 --> 34:28.118
All right, Alfred, you do it.
She's the key to finding Bruce.

34:28.193 --> 34:30.411
Captain! Captain!

34:30.474 --> 34:32.185
- Help me!
- ALFRED: Shut up!

34:32.447 --> 34:36.025
GORDON: Barnes, this is your last chance!
Give yourself up.

34:36.134 --> 34:38.025
BARNES (echoing): You dare threaten me?

34:38.119 --> 34:40.672
You destroyed the thing
I care most about.

34:40.879 --> 34:45.025
And for that, the sentence is death.

34:45.380 --> 34:47.893
- I don't think he's giving up.
- Yeah.

34:52.731 --> 34:54.063
BULLOCK: Hey Cap...

34:55.900 --> 34:57.734
(chuckles nervously)

34:57.836 --> 34:59.870
(bullets ricocheting)

35:04.443 --> 35:05.442
(Barnes groans)

35:06.612 --> 35:07.765
KATHRYN: Captain!

35:08.320 --> 35:13.607
Captain, stop this nonsense
and take me out of here now!

35:13.752 --> 35:14.818
BARNES: Nonsense?

35:15.036 --> 35:16.646
Nonsense?

35:21.216 --> 35:22.795
This is justice.

35:23.187 --> 35:24.578
No!

35:25.898 --> 35:27.297
- (Barnes yells)
- GORDON: Barnes!

35:32.345 --> 35:33.509
It's fitting, Jim.

35:34.649 --> 35:36.587
That you should meet your end here.

35:37.712 --> 35:39.810
The word will go out.

35:41.257 --> 35:43.468
No one will escape

35:43.953 --> 35:46.265
from the executioner's blade.

35:48.620 --> 35:49.820
(shotgun fires)

35:49.922 --> 35:53.056
(groans)

35:53.158 --> 35:54.769
No.

35:54.960 --> 35:56.886
No!

35:57.597 --> 35:59.378
You will face judgment.

35:59.683 --> 36:01.456
You will be judged!

36:01.720 --> 36:03.453
You know what, Captain?

36:03.579 --> 36:05.316
This place is a church.

36:06.363 --> 36:07.462
Mine.

36:22.654 --> 36:24.955
(gasps)

36:26.024 --> 36:27.624
(panting)

36:31.330 --> 36:33.029
(shouts)

36:34.299 --> 36:36.199
(shouts)

36:36.301 --> 36:37.868
(grunts)

36:39.321 --> 36:41.344
Our agreement still holds
for five hours.

36:41.618 --> 36:43.110
I am aware.

36:53.995 --> 36:56.074
How do you expect to win, Oswald?

36:56.597 --> 36:58.871
Barbara Kean runs the underworld.

36:59.168 --> 37:00.401
We have the gangs.

37:00.754 --> 37:02.174
You have...

37:02.955 --> 37:04.658
yourself. (laughs)

37:06.447 --> 37:09.139
Actually, I have an army

37:09.178 --> 37:11.076
of Hugo Strange's monsters
at my command.

37:11.904 --> 37:15.038
But even if I were alone,

37:15.679 --> 37:17.905
you wouldn't stand a chance.

37:19.390 --> 37:21.257
I suppose we'll see.

37:21.437 --> 37:23.132
I suppose so.

37:37.055 --> 37:39.342
- Let me know if you need anything.
- Yeah, okay.

37:42.843 --> 37:44.230
Lee?

37:44.388 --> 37:45.479
What are you doing here?

37:45.504 --> 37:46.817
I just came to get some things.

37:49.239 --> 37:51.205
You saw me, you thought
I'd heard about Barnes

37:51.241 --> 37:52.543
and I came to help?

37:52.832 --> 37:54.715
Is that such a crazy idea?

37:55.167 --> 37:56.699
It's just bad timing.

37:56.770 --> 37:59.257
And if I had heard I wouldn't have come.

37:59.416 --> 38:02.546
- I'm done with this place.
- So you keep saying.

38:02.786 --> 38:05.288
You know, Barnes loved the GCPD.

38:05.622 --> 38:07.522
But today he tried to destroy it.

38:07.691 --> 38:08.903
It was the virus.

38:09.005 --> 38:11.848
Or maybe he finally
discovered the truth:

38:12.195 --> 38:14.325
there is no justice here.

38:15.121 --> 38:16.790
Look at you... you still haven't paid

38:16.815 --> 38:18.675
for the pain that you've caused.

38:18.775 --> 38:20.538
But I guess that's the difference
between the two of us.

38:20.563 --> 38:22.647
I'm willing to pay for what I've done.

38:23.882 --> 38:25.648
What are you talking about,
what've you done?

38:25.893 --> 38:27.843
Nothing. Doesn't matter.

38:28.812 --> 38:31.101
Hey, Jim, my guy worked on the owl,

38:31.135 --> 38:33.035
says he's gonna need another hour.

38:33.133 --> 38:35.828
- What did Lee want?
- I have no idea.

38:36.553 --> 38:39.303
But, Harvey, if we do find
the location of the sites,

38:39.334 --> 38:40.897
we've got to be ready to move.

38:41.068 --> 38:43.232
Kathryn's killing is only
gonna energize the Court,

38:43.263 --> 38:45.107
- force their leader to act.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, wai-wait,

38:45.138 --> 38:48.172
there's someone above her? Who?

38:48.677 --> 38:50.533
I don't know.

39:11.396 --> 39:13.170
Go on, Bruce.

39:14.334 --> 39:17.842
The Court of Owls
must pay for what they did.

39:18.623 --> 39:20.371
It's the only way.

39:58.768 --> 40:00.076
Thank you.

40:03.357 --> 40:04.920
Tell me,

40:05.342 --> 40:10.865
how do you feel now when
you think of your parents' murder?

40:11.481 --> 40:12.950
I feel...

40:16.432 --> 40:17.825
...nothing.

40:20.824 --> 40:22.453
Hmm.

40:26.763 --> 40:28.162
(sighs)

40:30.467 --> 40:33.947
Talons have served the Court
since its inception.

40:34.017 --> 40:37.049
The Court culls them from orphanages.

40:37.107 --> 40:38.573
Trains them.

40:38.608 --> 40:43.707
What I did to you, the Court has
done with them for 200 years.

40:43.980 --> 40:48.014
But the process does more
than remove all feeling.

40:49.287 --> 40:53.740
Cut off the smallest finger
of your left hand.

40:59.888 --> 41:01.638
Shall I tell him to eat it?

41:02.482 --> 41:05.045
He will, if I say so.

41:06.725 --> 41:08.546
Bandage that.

41:09.721 --> 41:12.190
You see, Bruce, the pain of our memories

41:12.229 --> 41:14.987
can scar us, but it also defines us.

41:15.018 --> 41:16.744
Take away that pain

41:16.807 --> 41:20.619
and your mind becomes clay
for me to mold.

41:20.823 --> 41:22.752
I told you the truth.

41:22.811 --> 41:25.531
We will destroy the Court of Owls.

41:25.594 --> 41:28.922
And in so doing, you will become
the perfect weapon.

41:28.952 --> 41:32.867
For you will do whatever I say.

41:34.203 --> 41:36.015
Won't you?

41:39.539 --> 41:41.130
Yes.

41:43.817 --> 41:46.607
See? I told you it would work.

41:46.809 --> 41:49.341
This is it, Alfred...
we can find Bruce and end this.

41:49.419 --> 41:51.296
Alvarez, call Strike Force.

41:51.382 --> 41:53.315
I want every cop
on the roster in uniform

41:53.340 --> 41:55.264
and ready to roll in half an hour.

41:55.685 --> 41:57.272
What are you waiting for?

41:57.428 --> 41:59.858
I was coming to tell you.
I just got word from Arkham.

42:00.108 --> 42:01.793
Barnes escaped his transport.

42:02.052 --> 42:04.186
Took out three guards. He's in the wind.

42:04.245 --> 42:06.333
We just busted that dude
five minutes ago.

42:06.723 --> 42:08.348
There's more.

42:12.816 --> 42:15.847
What is this doing in here?
It's supposed to be in Lucius' office.

42:15.956 --> 42:18.527
He must have moved it. He said
he needed to run some tests.

42:18.635 --> 42:21.362
The virus sample
we got from Hugo Strange...

42:21.519 --> 42:23.276
- it's gone.
- Maybe Lucius took it.

42:23.300 --> 42:24.712
You're the only two
with the combination, right?

42:24.737 --> 42:25.988
Yeah.

42:27.626 --> 42:29.824
No. Lee has it, too.

42:30.947 --> 42:33.082
âª

42:45.896 --> 42:48.030
(sighs)

42:53.003 --> 42:55.137
