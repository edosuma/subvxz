WEBVTT

00:06.213 --> 00:08.380
We assumed that Jian Yang's app
was camera-based.

00:08.380 --> 00:10.547
No, my app is a SeeFood.

00:10.547 --> 00:11.589
Like a food...

00:11.881 --> 00:13.172
-That you can see.
-...that you can see.

00:13.172 --> 00:16.213
Oh, "see food."
S-E-E food.

00:17.589 --> 00:20.088
SeeFood has to be great.
My job depends on it.

00:20.297 --> 00:22.881
Uh, you guys,
Gavin Belson just got fired!

00:22.881 --> 00:25.839
"Belson violated Hooli protocol
in the acquisition

00:25.839 --> 00:28.881
of a company that contained
toxic assets."

00:28.881 --> 00:29.963
Oh, that's us!

00:31.130 --> 00:33.797
So, you're telling me
that the perfect application

00:33.797 --> 00:37.213
of my algorithm belongs
to Gavin fucking Belson?

00:40.756 --> 00:43.047
-Oh, hey.
-Did you get into Stanford?

00:43.047 --> 00:44.797
They said they liked my story.

00:45.213 --> 00:46.881
Why is my name on the board?

00:47.088 --> 00:49.422
--Oh, no...

01:06.797 --> 01:08.547
I know it's the middle
of the night.

01:08.547 --> 01:10.922
I really just need
five minutes of your time.

01:15.213 --> 01:16.213
Okay.

01:18.630 --> 01:20.630
- Holy shit.
- What happened?

01:20.630 --> 01:23.005
I was working
through some issues.

01:23.005 --> 01:24.297
Mind the glass.

01:29.130 --> 01:31.130
What the fuck is this?

01:31.130 --> 01:33.297
It's a license...

01:33.297 --> 01:35.630
for your peer-to-peer
computer communication patent.

01:35.630 --> 01:37.797
It's-- It's very standard stuff.

01:37.797 --> 01:39.672
Essentially, in exchange
for your patent,

01:39.672 --> 01:42.714
you would get
a royalty and equity

01:42.714 --> 01:44.963
in the new company
that I'm starting up.

01:44.963 --> 01:46.839
So if you just, uh,

01:46.839 --> 01:48.297
sign there
by the Post-It note,

01:48.297 --> 01:51.297
and I will take it and leave,
and you will never see me again.

01:52.714 --> 01:53.963
Are you joking?

01:55.130 --> 01:57.047
Uh, well, I guess
we could hang out.

01:57.047 --> 01:58.756
Richard, stop talking.

01:58.756 --> 02:00.797
I was just ousted
from my own company,

02:00.797 --> 02:02.672
a company I built
from the ground up.

02:02.672 --> 02:04.963
My legacy is in ashes.

02:04.963 --> 02:07.339
Oh. Come on, I wouldn't...
I wouldn't say that.

02:07.339 --> 02:09.172
Well, The Wall Street
Journal  said that.

02:09.172 --> 02:12.005
Oh?
I lost everything
because of something you did,

02:12.005 --> 02:15.047
and you're here at 3:00 a.m.
asking me for a favor?

02:15.047 --> 02:18.172
Really? You're a mean person,
Richard. Do you know that?

02:18.172 --> 02:19.839
You are a bad guy.

02:19.839 --> 02:21.672
No. No, no, no.
I wouldn't say that.

02:21.672 --> 02:25.172
I think, maybe,
what's happening is that
you're just not understanding

02:25.172 --> 02:26.630
the technology
I'm trying to build here.

02:26.630 --> 02:28.630
Oh, so now I'm stupid, too?

02:28.630 --> 02:30.756
I know what
the technology is, Richard.

02:30.756 --> 02:31.963
I have a patent on it.

02:31.963 --> 02:34.005
What the fuck is
a matter with you?

02:35.505 --> 02:37.172
So you're not gonna sign it?

02:37.172 --> 02:38.672
No, I'm not
gonna sign this!

02:38.672 --> 02:41.172
Jesus! You're a fucking sadist,
you know that?

02:41.172 --> 02:42.339
You're demented!

02:42.339 --> 02:44.088
I'm almost tempted
to let you have a run at it

02:44.088 --> 02:45.547
just to watch you waste
your fucking time.

02:45.547 --> 02:48.464
This technology did not work
when Peter theorized it,

02:48.464 --> 02:50.047
and it doesn't work now.

02:54.172 --> 02:57.547
It-It, um...
It actually does work now.

02:57.547 --> 02:59.172
It does.
Oh, really?

02:59.172 --> 03:00.922
When did the laws
of physics change?

03:00.922 --> 03:04.505
When I exceeded
the theoretical limit
of compression at TechCrunch.

03:04.505 --> 03:06.088
You were there.
I know I was there!

03:06.088 --> 03:08.756
Thank you for bringing up
that very painful memory!

03:13.839 --> 03:14.797
Okay.

03:14.797 --> 03:17.339
Can I...
Can I just...

03:17.339 --> 03:19.130
What?
...draw on this?

03:19.130 --> 03:22.339
Sure, why not?
It's shattered,
just like I am.

03:22.339 --> 03:25.255
I read Peter's notes,
all of them,

03:25.255 --> 03:30.172
and he knew
that a peer-to-peer Internet
was possible in the future,

03:30.172 --> 03:32.881
but he was
also basing that on,

03:32.881 --> 03:34.505
what,
old desktop computers.

03:34.505 --> 03:38.547
He never, ever foresaw
the ubiquity or power

03:38.547 --> 03:41.088
of all of our modern-day
smartphones.

03:41.088 --> 03:43.922
He was also dealing
with a completely different
Weissman limit.

03:45.047 --> 03:47.756
So... uh, yeah.
Yeah. Okay.

03:47.756 --> 03:50.589
What is that?
Is that number correct?

03:50.589 --> 03:52.839
The delta
in mean device efficiency?

03:52.839 --> 03:54.297
Yeah, it is.

03:54.297 --> 03:56.714
See, eventually,
over time,

03:56.714 --> 03:59.422
this will render
every server

03:59.422 --> 04:01.797
that Hooli
operates obsolete,

04:01.797 --> 04:03.672
which would make
Jack Barker shit himself.

04:03.672 --> 04:05.339
Holy shit!
You know what?

04:05.339 --> 04:07.130
Actually, I'm gonna...

04:11.047 --> 04:12.547
Welcome
to the future, Gavin.

04:13.881 --> 04:15.589
Whoa!
Oh, no. Oh, no.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.464
Son of a bitch!
I-- I'm sorry.

04:29.297 --> 04:32.130
Wow, Dinesh,
this front-end design
looks great.

04:32.130 --> 04:33.922
Thank you.
Nice work.

04:33.922 --> 04:35.547
What's in that?

04:35.547 --> 04:38.172
That is a burrito
for the test.

04:39.172 --> 04:40.714
Good to know.
Oh.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.505
Let him have it.
Gilfoyle thought

04:42.505 --> 04:44.297
he was too good
to work on SeeFood,

04:44.297 --> 04:46.130
and now he's
about to lose a fortune.

04:46.130 --> 04:48.422
Okay. Ready for test.

04:48.422 --> 04:50.505
After you, milady.

04:50.505 --> 04:53.297
Oh, this is weird.
Mia just texted me
"Good luck with the demo."

04:53.297 --> 04:54.714
Did any of you guys
tell her about this?

04:54.714 --> 04:57.380
Your hacker girlfriend
wouldn't happen to know

04:57.380 --> 04:59.464
the model of our router,
would she?

04:59.464 --> 05:02.714
Yeah, actually,
she... complimented
your choice.

05:03.797 --> 05:05.088
Why didn't
you say anything?

05:05.088 --> 05:07.547
Why would I tell you she said
something nice about you?

05:07.547 --> 05:08.756
Damn it.

05:08.756 --> 05:10.339
We have to assume
she's everywhere.

05:13.339 --> 05:15.005
Okay. It's ready.

05:16.005 --> 05:17.339
Please, God.

05:17.339 --> 05:21.505
What would you say
if I told you there is
an app on the ma--

05:21.505 --> 05:23.505
We're past that part!
Just demo it.

05:24.589 --> 05:27.213
Okay. Let's start
with a hot dog.

05:36.422 --> 05:38.172
Oh shit.

05:38.172 --> 05:39.672
- Yes! Oh!
- It works.

05:39.672 --> 05:41.213
- Motherfuck!
- Huzzah!

05:41.213 --> 05:44.505
Jian-Yang, my beautiful
little Asiatic friend,

05:44.505 --> 05:47.213
I'm going to buy you
the palapa of your life.

05:47.213 --> 05:50.547
We will have 12 posts,
braided palm leaves.

05:50.547 --> 05:52.005
You'll never
feel exposed again.

05:52.005 --> 05:53.547
I'm gonna be rich.

05:53.547 --> 05:54.797
Fuck you, Gilfoyle.

05:54.797 --> 05:55.922
Do pizza.
Yes, do pizza.

05:55.922 --> 05:57.714
- Yeah.
- Do pizza.

05:57.714 --> 05:58.839
Pizza.

06:04.756 --> 06:06.380
"Not hot dog"?

06:06.380 --> 06:08.922
Wait. What the fuck?
Huh?

06:08.922 --> 06:10.213
That's-- that's it?

06:10.213 --> 06:11.714
It only does hot dogs?

06:11.714 --> 06:13.505
No, and "not hot dog."

06:13.505 --> 06:15.881
Give me that.
Give it to me.

06:21.005 --> 06:23.963
Jian-Yang.
Motherfuck.

06:23.963 --> 06:26.255
I gave you the ability
to spin gold,

06:26.255 --> 06:28.422
and instead,
you've spun pubic hair

06:28.422 --> 06:31.589
with shit in it,
and gravel and corn--
Hold on, hold on.

06:31.589 --> 06:34.464
Jian-Yang's
actually put together
a pretty good classifier.

06:34.464 --> 06:36.881
You know? I mean,
the core tech is valid.

06:36.881 --> 06:38.922
It just...
It just needs
to be trained.

06:38.922 --> 06:41.005
So, what he did
for hot dogs,

06:41.005 --> 06:44.130
he needs to repeat
for every food in existence?

06:44.130 --> 06:46.672
No, that's very boring work.

06:46.672 --> 06:50.380
That's scraping the Internet
for thousands of food pictures.

06:50.380 --> 06:51.839
You can--
you can hire
someone else.

06:51.839 --> 06:53.756
We can't,
because we just spent

06:53.756 --> 06:57.130
a big fat stack of cash
on little Dinesh over here.

06:57.130 --> 06:58.339
And there are
other expenses--

06:58.339 --> 07:01.047
legal, marketing,
operating fees,

07:01.047 --> 07:03.464
those goddamn
AWS charges.

07:03.464 --> 07:05.130
Fucking Bezos.

07:07.130 --> 07:08.714
And so,
we do not have
the funds

07:08.714 --> 07:11.380
to hire scut workers
to do your scraping for you.

07:11.380 --> 07:13.963
And thus,
you will scrape
the Internet.

07:13.963 --> 07:15.464
You and you alone.

07:15.464 --> 07:18.505
I'm sorry, the time
to back out was before
you signed the term sheet.

07:18.505 --> 07:22.213
I'm gonna tell Laurie that
this was a smashing success.

07:22.213 --> 07:23.422
Go make it one.

07:23.422 --> 07:26.672
Erlich was right.
You are a white witch.

07:28.422 --> 07:29.963
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah.

07:39.172 --> 07:40.297
Oh.

07:42.714 --> 07:44.672
Good. Yes, you are all here.

07:44.672 --> 07:48.297
Um, I think it's probably time
we all had a chat.

07:50.547 --> 07:51.505
About what?

07:51.505 --> 07:53.255
Well, I'm pretty sure
you're all...

07:53.255 --> 07:54.797
wondering
where I've been.

07:54.797 --> 07:55.797
You were gone?

07:55.797 --> 07:57.756
Yes, I was gone all week.

07:57.756 --> 07:59.672
I saw you come out
of the shower yesterday.

07:59.672 --> 08:03.339
Okay. Well,
obviously, I've been
sleeping here at night,

08:03.339 --> 08:04.839
but I've been gone
during the day.

08:04.839 --> 08:06.505
Pretty sure that shower
was in the morning.

08:06.505 --> 08:07.839
That's part
of the day, Richard.

08:07.839 --> 08:10.297
Okay, Gilfoyle, I-I-- I've been
sleeping here at night,

08:10.297 --> 08:12.172
and then I've been here
for some mornings,

08:12.172 --> 08:14.255
but I'm--
I've left the house
during the day.

08:14.255 --> 08:16.172
We all leave the house
during the day, Richard.

08:16.172 --> 08:17.630
That's not weird.

08:17.630 --> 08:19.380
I went to get coffee
this morning.

08:19.380 --> 08:21.339
Yeah, I went
to the dispensary,

08:21.339 --> 08:23.881
and then I'd smoked
the weed before I got home,

08:23.881 --> 08:25.464
so I went back
to the dispensary.

08:25.464 --> 08:26.756
You know what?

08:26.756 --> 08:29.714
I just realized I haven't left
the house in six days.

08:29.714 --> 08:31.881
Now that's worth exploring.

08:31.881 --> 08:33.130
Okay, I get it. Look.

08:33.130 --> 08:35.756
Every day this week,
I have been...

08:35.756 --> 08:37.630
at Gavin Belson's house.

08:37.630 --> 08:41.255
What?
Gavin has offered to go
into business together.

08:42.297 --> 08:44.505
But, look,
I just came there
for the patent,

08:44.505 --> 08:46.630
and he was
the one who wanted
to be full partners.

08:46.630 --> 08:49.380
What did you say?

08:49.380 --> 08:50.922
We talked about it,
and we agreed

08:50.922 --> 08:52.547
that it would be
the best thing to do.

08:52.547 --> 08:55.672
Oh, good Lord.
Richard... no.

08:55.672 --> 08:57.047
Guys, look,
I have the patent.

08:57.047 --> 08:58.505
I also have funding

08:58.505 --> 09:00.922
and real, genuine insight
to the whole thing.

09:00.922 --> 09:03.672
Let's not forget here
that Gavin is

09:03.672 --> 09:06.839
a co-founder
of a bajillion-dollar
tech company.

09:06.839 --> 09:08.422
Are you out
of your fucking mind?

09:08.422 --> 09:12.672
When you don
the skin of the beast,
the man within dies.

09:12.672 --> 09:13.922
What is that? Nietzsche?

09:13.922 --> 09:16.380
One of the boys
at my group home
always said that.

09:16.380 --> 09:17.380
He died.

09:17.380 --> 09:19.088
You're not pulling Dinesh
off SeeFood.

09:19.088 --> 09:20.797
And I am not
leaving SeeFood

09:20.797 --> 09:22.630
to go work
for Gavin fucking Belson.

09:22.630 --> 09:25.797
I'm not asking you to.
You're not?

09:25.797 --> 09:27.797
Guys, do you not remember
the last time we talked

09:27.797 --> 09:30.255
about us all working
with Gavin Belson?

09:30.255 --> 09:33.630
Gilfoyle, you told me
to chortle your balls,

09:33.630 --> 09:35.922
and everybody else
walked out of the room.

09:35.922 --> 09:38.505
I know how much
you hate him,

09:38.505 --> 09:41.297
which is exactly why
I told Gavin if we were
gonna do this thing,

09:41.297 --> 09:43.213
that you guys
wouldn't be coming with.

09:43.213 --> 09:46.213
So we have hired
a recruiter to...

09:47.088 --> 09:48.630
find people
to replace you guys.

09:48.630 --> 09:49.963
Even me?

09:49.963 --> 09:51.088
Uh, well, no.

09:51.088 --> 09:53.047
You don't really need
to be replaced.

09:53.047 --> 09:55.088
True, I can't be replaced.

09:56.963 --> 09:58.922
Well, when you left
video chat,

09:58.922 --> 10:02.464
you did keep the rights
to the algorithm, so--

10:02.464 --> 10:03.630
I mean, it's weird,

10:03.630 --> 10:05.630
but I guess it's really
none of our business.

10:05.630 --> 10:09.047
It's my fucking business.
I now own ten percent--

10:09.047 --> 10:10.464
Five percent, actually.

10:10.464 --> 10:12.464
What?
Ten percent of my half

10:12.464 --> 10:14.213
of the company
is five percent.

10:14.213 --> 10:17.047
But, I mean, look,
your shares are gonna
be worth a whole lot more

10:17.047 --> 10:21.130
than they ever would,
now with the patent and Gavin
being involved, so...

10:22.213 --> 10:24.297
So then we're all good here,
I guess, right?

10:24.297 --> 10:25.464
I think that's right.

10:26.797 --> 10:28.047
Weird.

10:28.047 --> 10:30.297
All right. Well,
thanks for understanding.

10:30.297 --> 10:31.756
Uh, you're welcome.

10:43.005 --> 10:45.255
I don't think
we need to be afraid
of the Wi-Fi.

10:45.255 --> 10:46.839
It's pronounced "wifey,"

10:46.839 --> 10:49.005
and clearly
you don't understand
the threat level

10:49.005 --> 10:51.505
of the person that you're
sexually disappointing.

10:51.505 --> 10:52.756
We're going hardwire.

10:52.756 --> 10:54.005
What about for my phone?

10:54.005 --> 10:56.047
You mean the thing
that tracks your movement

10:56.047 --> 10:57.672
and every interaction
you have?

10:57.672 --> 10:59.464
Literally,
your fingerprint?

10:59.464 --> 11:00.839
The second
you're on Wi-Fi,

11:00.839 --> 11:02.963
it's like you're
leaving her alone
with your phone.

11:04.756 --> 11:08.672
So, actually
leaving her alone
with my phone...

11:09.756 --> 11:11.255
that would be bad?

11:11.255 --> 11:13.213
You fucking idiot.

11:13.213 --> 11:14.714
I was in the bathroom.

11:14.714 --> 11:15.839
For how long?

11:16.839 --> 11:17.839
A while.

11:20.505 --> 11:21.630
Really?

11:21.630 --> 11:22.672
Who's that?

11:23.881 --> 11:25.756
Oh, Richard's meeting
with Brett Saxby.

11:25.756 --> 11:27.339
From Hooli?

11:27.339 --> 11:29.505
Formerly.
The recruiter
sent him over.

11:29.505 --> 11:31.881
He's interviewing him
for head of engineering.

11:34.255 --> 11:36.088
Why? That guy sucks.

11:38.464 --> 11:40.297
Why is Richard in there
with Brett Saxby?

11:40.297 --> 11:42.756
I mean, he was
in Gavin's inner circle.

11:42.756 --> 11:43.922
Is Richard aware of that?

11:43.922 --> 11:45.213
Is anyone taking notes?

11:45.213 --> 11:47.047
Does Richard
even have a pen?

11:53.547 --> 11:55.839
That is so funny.

11:55.839 --> 11:57.088
It's 10:00 a.m.

11:58.172 --> 11:59.839
Why are they drinking beer?

11:59.839 --> 12:01.422
Because he sucks.

12:01.422 --> 12:03.589
Did Dick say who else
he was meeting with?

12:03.589 --> 12:06.714
The recruiter sent him
a whole big list right there.

12:09.422 --> 12:10.630
Gonna be late
for class.

12:10.630 --> 12:11.881
Ooh, how's that going?

12:11.881 --> 12:13.756
Oh, it's okay.
I'm just a little nervous

12:13.756 --> 12:15.922
I might run out
of material soon.

12:15.922 --> 12:17.630
We already watched
the Facebook movie,

12:17.630 --> 12:20.213
A.I., The Net,
and half of Tron.

12:20.213 --> 12:21.422
Which Tron?

12:21.422 --> 12:23.255
What? No. Tron.

12:23.255 --> 12:24.756
There's two Trons.

12:24.756 --> 12:26.630
Oh, shit.
That's awesome.

12:26.630 --> 12:30.005
It should get me
through another week. Thanks.

12:30.005 --> 12:33.213
This entire list
is a shit show of shitheads.

12:33.213 --> 12:34.756
Why would
Richard trust
a recruiter

12:34.756 --> 12:37.130
to source him recruits?
It doesn't make sense.

12:37.130 --> 12:38.547
Huh.
What?

12:38.547 --> 12:40.172
You guys seem
like super invested

12:40.172 --> 12:43.630
in who Richard hires to work
with Gavin Belson, that's all.

12:43.630 --> 12:45.547
Are you
insinuating jealousy?

12:45.547 --> 12:48.172
This is just concern
for Richard's vision.
Mm-hmm.

12:48.172 --> 12:51.297
If Richard wants
to saddle himself
with mediocrity...

12:52.464 --> 12:53.547
go for it.

12:53.547 --> 12:55.297
You did not.

12:55.297 --> 12:57.797
I swear to God, bro.
I swear to God.

12:57.797 --> 12:59.464
Well, I'll tell you what.
Next time you bust out

12:59.464 --> 13:01.130
the old Sea-Doo,
give me a call.

13:01.130 --> 13:04.088
Good.
Guys, you know Brett.

13:04.088 --> 13:05.130
Nope.

13:05.130 --> 13:06.756
Uh, it's great
to meet you guys.

13:06.756 --> 13:07.714
We've met.

13:07.714 --> 13:10.630
Uh, okay.
Well, it has been
a pleasure.

13:10.630 --> 13:13.464
I shall walk you
to your car.

13:13.464 --> 13:15.422
All right.
Uh, After me.
Yeah.

13:15.422 --> 13:16.797
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.

13:21.547 --> 13:22.672
I hate him.

13:22.672 --> 13:26.047
Gentlemen, I just paid
the palapa contractor.

13:26.047 --> 13:27.714
The palapa piper,
so to speak.

13:27.714 --> 13:29.339
The dream is a reality.

13:29.339 --> 13:32.589
We'll no longer be exposed...
to the elements.

13:32.589 --> 13:34.422
Hey, Erlich.

13:34.422 --> 13:36.547
You wanna guess who's
on this list of availables

13:36.547 --> 13:38.339
that Richard just got
from his recruiter?

13:38.339 --> 13:39.339
Who?

13:39.339 --> 13:40.797
Your boy, Jian-Yang.

13:42.047 --> 13:43.172
What?
What?

13:44.547 --> 13:46.047
Jian-Yang!

13:46.047 --> 13:48.047
You already have
a fucking job, Jian-Yang.

13:48.047 --> 13:49.464
You have
to finish SeeFood.

13:49.464 --> 13:51.672
Now get
to food scraping.

13:51.672 --> 13:52.963
I fucking hate SeeFood.

13:52.963 --> 13:55.005
I have to look
at different hot dogs.

13:55.005 --> 13:57.005
There's Chinese hot dogs,

13:57.005 --> 13:59.797
Polish hot dogs,
Jewish hot dogs.
It fucking stupid.

13:59.797 --> 14:02.380
Well, here.
Here's one more for you.

14:05.047 --> 14:07.922
See? "Hot dog." It doesn't
even fucking work right.

14:09.047 --> 14:11.380
Then you should hire someone
using company money,

14:11.380 --> 14:14.213
not build a roof
over nothing.

14:14.213 --> 14:16.547
The palapa was budgeted for,
Jian-Yang.

14:16.547 --> 14:17.922
That's what you do
when you get funding,

14:17.922 --> 14:20.797
you upscale your workspace
to help with recruiting.

14:20.797 --> 14:22.297
You just said
you recruit no one.

14:22.297 --> 14:24.047
Because we spent
all the money on upscaling.

14:24.047 --> 14:26.088
Why... Why is this
so confusing?

14:26.088 --> 14:29.963
You're stealing.
If you can steal,
I can quit.

14:29.963 --> 14:34.213
I have meetings
at Periscope, Airbnb.

14:34.213 --> 14:35.547
Good companies.

14:35.547 --> 14:37.881
The fuck you do.

14:37.881 --> 14:41.547
We still have $150,000
of Raviga's money left.

14:41.547 --> 14:42.922
That's three months
of burn.

14:42.922 --> 14:46.797
So, until we are
dick up and flat broke,
this is your life.

14:46.797 --> 14:47.797
Get to it.

14:51.714 --> 14:53.672
This is no life.

14:53.672 --> 14:55.130
I want to live.

14:55.130 --> 14:57.255
Erase that dick picture.

14:58.797 --> 15:01.589
You've got mail.

15:01.589 --> 15:02.714
Yes.

15:05.630 --> 15:07.297
Those are
very powerful words.

15:07.297 --> 15:08.339
Sorry.

15:08.339 --> 15:09.714
No, no. It's okay.

15:09.714 --> 15:12.505
Your phone has
technology inside it,

15:12.505 --> 15:14.255
so you're double-learning.

15:14.255 --> 15:16.672

You say,
"Keep doing SeeFood
until money is gone."

15:33.297 --> 15:36.130
Now, the money is gone.

15:37.297 --> 15:38.297
Dick...

15:39.422 --> 15:41.339
is up.

15:41.339 --> 15:43.963
Where'd you get
those sunglasses?
Did they come with the car?

15:45.589 --> 15:47.213
These are
from your mom.

15:47.213 --> 15:50.172
Listen, Jian-Yang,
you can't just blow the rest
of our runway on a Corvette.

15:50.172 --> 15:52.339
Who's gonna
scrape the Internet?

15:52.339 --> 15:53.380
Twelve-speaker sound system.

Oh, just three months
of runway being driven off

16:10.797 --> 16:13.297
by 90 pounds
of asshole.

16:13.297 --> 16:17.047
Spoken by a 280-pound
pile of shit.

16:18.255 --> 16:19.672
The fuck are
you gonna do now?

16:21.255 --> 16:23.672
Professor Bighetti,
a word if you please?

16:25.047 --> 16:26.963
Richard...

16:26.963 --> 16:29.839
I know it's none
of my business...

16:29.839 --> 16:32.505
but I worked with that
Brett Saxby fellow at Hooli.

16:32.505 --> 16:34.005
He's a talented engineer,

16:34.005 --> 16:38.339
but in an office environment,
he can be both tardy and fresh.

16:38.339 --> 16:40.339
Uh, I'm--
I'm not hiring him.

16:40.339 --> 16:42.005
He uses spaces not tabs.

16:42.005 --> 16:44.047
I see. Okay.

16:44.047 --> 16:45.255
Well, that's a relief.

16:45.255 --> 16:48.881
But, Richard, what about
the next Brett Saxby?

16:49.839 --> 16:52.130
Or the Brett Saxby
after that?

16:52.130 --> 16:53.881
And even
if you vet them all,

16:53.881 --> 16:56.172
you are still
in a room with Gavin.

16:56.172 --> 16:57.963
So? We're partners.
What's your point?

16:57.963 --> 16:59.881
He and his--
his posse

16:59.881 --> 17:01.963
of-- of bandits
and cutthroats

17:01.963 --> 17:03.630
will turn on you
in a second.

17:03.630 --> 17:05.213
You need me...

17:05.213 --> 17:07.547
the half-crazed,
half-Apache

17:07.547 --> 17:09.380
who will do anything
to get your back.

17:09.380 --> 17:10.797
I'll scalp Gavin
if I have to,

17:10.797 --> 17:12.547
and all the rest
of those paleface
sons of bitches.

17:12.547 --> 17:14.881
I'll kill them with knives.
I'll kill them with guns.

17:14.881 --> 17:16.213
I'll kill them
with my hands.

17:16.213 --> 17:18.505
I'll talk them into suicide.
It doesn't matter.

17:18.505 --> 17:22.839
All right, Jared,
I... I think what
you're asking is...

17:22.839 --> 17:24.088
you want a job?

17:24.088 --> 17:26.297
If you think you can
find a place for me--

17:26.297 --> 17:28.380
Yeah, of course, Jared.
Yeah?

17:28.380 --> 17:30.547
You're more than welcome
to work on this.

17:32.213 --> 17:35.589
But just to be clear,
you're not gonna stab
anyone, are you?

17:38.255 --> 17:40.088
Oh, it feels good
to laugh.

17:41.797 --> 17:44.088
So... So,
that's a no then?

17:44.088 --> 17:47.047
Richard.

17:49.922 --> 17:52.505
So, we're not gonna finish
the movie?

17:52.505 --> 17:56.756
Yeah, sorry,
but my colleague here
was pretty adamant

17:56.756 --> 17:58.672
that a better use
of class time

17:58.672 --> 18:01.756
might be to learn
while accomplishing something.

18:01.756 --> 18:03.422
Now take one, pass it
all the way down.

18:03.422 --> 18:06.255
We're supposed
to scrape the Internet
for thousands of food images?

18:06.255 --> 18:11.422
Yeah. So you'll find, like,
five or 30,000 pictures
of your food,

18:11.422 --> 18:15.756
and then put them in a folder
with that food's name on it.

18:15.756 --> 18:18.714
And it's good if you get,
like, weird angles

18:18.714 --> 18:21.547
or lighting of your food.
So it should be pretty fun.

18:21.547 --> 18:23.797
So we're gathering
training data

18:23.797 --> 18:26.339
to run through
a convolutional neural net.

18:26.339 --> 18:27.839
Like an image classifier?

18:27.839 --> 18:29.297
Who wants broccoli?

18:29.297 --> 18:31.339
Broccolini
for the ladies?
Broccoli.

18:31.339 --> 18:35.130
Just so you know,
this does not mean
I don't trust her.

18:35.130 --> 18:39.297
I'm just doing this
so you'll, like, shut up
and leave me alone.

18:39.297 --> 18:42.630
Mia, if you're listening,
you're so pretty.

18:43.797 --> 18:45.380
Oh, you're both
headed to Gavin's?

18:45.380 --> 18:47.839
Indeed we are.
Together again.

18:47.839 --> 18:50.630
Butch Cassidy and his head
of business development.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.881
Oh, wow,
another Western reference.

18:52.881 --> 18:55.714
Yaw!
Let's go.

18:58.380 --> 19:01.422
You know,
he'd hire you, too.
What?

19:01.422 --> 19:04.130
All you have to do is admit
that you want the job.

19:05.339 --> 19:07.963
And, like, get down
on your knees and beg.

19:07.963 --> 19:10.005
Says the guy
who's romancing a woman

19:10.005 --> 19:12.130
through a phone
that isn't even on.

19:12.130 --> 19:14.672
A woman that he described
to me in private

19:14.672 --> 19:17.047
as a skinny
little fuck factory.

19:17.047 --> 19:19.672
Oh, no, I didn't. God.

19:21.339 --> 19:23.213
Mia, I would never do that.

19:24.547 --> 19:26.172
Richard, Brett Saxby ran

19:26.172 --> 19:28.005
my data analytics team
for three years.

19:28.005 --> 19:30.464
Respectfully,
I think passing
on him is a mistake.

19:30.464 --> 19:33.756
Yes. Well, uh,
I met with Brett Saxby,

19:33.756 --> 19:38.005
and, um...
to be honest...

19:40.839 --> 19:43.881
To be honest, I don't--
I don't think he's our man.

19:43.881 --> 19:46.839
Fair enough.
There are plenty of good
alternatives on this list.

19:46.839 --> 19:50.756
Although, I'm a little confused
by your notes on some
of these people.

19:50.756 --> 19:55.047
"David Burnham.
Annoying slob,
fucked-up face.

19:55.047 --> 19:58.589
I could write better Python
with my asshole."

19:58.589 --> 20:01.172
You know what? I think...
I think you have my list.

20:01.172 --> 20:03.589
Yes, I have
a very weird shorthand.

20:03.589 --> 20:04.881
Yeah.

20:07.213 --> 20:09.380
Okay, next.

20:09.380 --> 20:10.672
Becca Th--

20:10.672 --> 20:12.881
No, guys,
that goes in the--
the sunroom.

20:12.881 --> 20:14.297
I'll show you. All right.

20:14.297 --> 20:15.380
Back in a flash.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.255
Come this way,
gentlemen. Here.

20:18.630 --> 20:21.213
God, there are pages
of graphic insults here.

20:21.213 --> 20:23.464
Fucking Gilfoyle.
Right?

20:25.630 --> 20:29.422
Richard, would you be open
to having Gilfoyle
on the team?

20:29.422 --> 20:31.922
Well, yeah, of course.
I mean, I'd hire him
in a second,

20:31.922 --> 20:33.922
but he'd never do it.

20:33.922 --> 20:37.005
Richard, Gilfoyle is
a man of intense pride.

20:37.005 --> 20:39.922
So, when he refers
to a potential employee

20:39.922 --> 20:42.922
as a "pig-faced
fuck nose,"

20:42.922 --> 20:46.589
what I hear is
"I need to be needed."

20:46.589 --> 20:49.255
Well, what I hear is
"pig-faced fuck nose."

20:49.255 --> 20:51.297
Exactly.
I mean, Gilfoyle's insults

20:51.297 --> 20:54.130
are normally well crafted,
almost poetic.

20:54.130 --> 20:58.714
Last week, he referred
to me as "Frankenstein's
bulimic daughter."

20:58.714 --> 21:01.339
Yeah, I get
what you mean.

21:01.339 --> 21:04.297
So what do you want me
to do, Jared, beg him?

21:04.297 --> 21:05.797
Well, I... I think
a little outreach

21:05.797 --> 21:07.589
would be
in the company's
best interest.

21:09.464 --> 21:11.630
Really? "Butt-dick"?

21:12.630 --> 21:14.005
The man's in pain.

21:15.963 --> 21:19.005
Hey, I know this system
is super confusing,

21:19.005 --> 21:22.130
but we don't see
any completed assignments.

21:23.130 --> 21:25.380
Cut the shit.
Where's the work?

21:25.380 --> 21:28.963
Well, we all got to talking
the other day after class.

21:28.963 --> 21:32.047
We couldn't figure out
if you were, like, a TA

21:32.047 --> 21:34.130
or why you were
giving us assignments,

21:34.130 --> 21:36.297
but we all agreed
we didn't like the way

21:36.297 --> 21:38.005
that you were speaking
to Professor Bighetti.

21:38.005 --> 21:41.297
I'm used to it.
So we searched your name
on PitchBook,

21:41.297 --> 21:44.839
and that SeeFood app you got
funded at Raviga popped up.

21:44.839 --> 21:47.005
PitchBook?
How do you have
access to PitchBook?

21:47.005 --> 21:48.714
Your idea was
so simple.

21:48.714 --> 21:51.672
It was like something
you could come up with
in the room during a meeting.

21:51.672 --> 21:54.255
Which is what Garrett
from Coleman Blair told us

21:54.255 --> 21:56.630
at the CS undergrad mixer
on Friday.

21:56.630 --> 21:58.047
Hey, Erlich.

21:58.047 --> 22:00.339
Here I am.
Class of '06.

22:01.422 --> 22:03.505
Go Cardinal.
Go Cardinal.

22:03.505 --> 22:06.130
Anyways, we founded our own
Shazam-for-food company,

22:06.130 --> 22:08.422
and he's funding us.
Mm-hmm.

22:08.422 --> 22:10.589
Whoa, congrats!
Wait, that's stealing.

22:10.589 --> 22:14.047
No. It's exactly
what Mark Zuckerberg did
to the Winkle guy

22:14.047 --> 22:16.714
in that Facebook movie
Professor Bighetti
had us watch.

22:16.714 --> 22:18.172
And he was the hero
of that film.

22:18.172 --> 22:19.547
And with all
of us working together,

22:19.547 --> 22:20.922
we'll easily
beat you to market.

22:20.922 --> 22:23.547
So, that's how
it goes, huh? Hmm?

22:23.547 --> 22:26.547
You steal a man's idea,
rendering his company worthless.

22:29.172 --> 22:32.756
I've read a number
of disparaging articles
about your generation

22:32.756 --> 22:35.797
in The Atlantic
and Slate.com summaries.

22:35.797 --> 22:37.047
It's all true.

22:38.130 --> 22:39.922
fuck you!

22:41.797 --> 22:43.714
Professor Bighetti,
I'll see you at home.

22:46.047 --> 22:47.963
You apologize?

22:47.963 --> 22:50.505
In this case,
yes, I apologize.

22:50.505 --> 22:53.881
Who am I to advise you
on your very valuable company?

22:53.881 --> 22:55.839
It's time to let you go,
like a bird.

22:55.839 --> 22:58.213
So, go out there
without me.

22:58.213 --> 23:00.756
Make your recipe app.
Take your meetings.

23:00.756 --> 23:04.255
Live.
That being said...

23:04.255 --> 23:07.047
...since there's no cash
to buy me out,

23:07.047 --> 23:08.297
I propose this:

23:08.297 --> 23:10.213
allow me to keep
the palapa

23:10.213 --> 23:12.797
and give me the 'Vette.

23:12.797 --> 23:14.047
You're cashing out?

23:15.088 --> 23:16.881
Dinesh, stay out
of this, please.

23:16.881 --> 23:19.213
Car and hut
for ten percent?

23:19.213 --> 23:20.464
It's a palapa.

23:20.464 --> 23:22.088
Okay. It's a deal.

23:23.589 --> 23:25.380
You know,
the car was a mistake.

23:25.380 --> 23:28.589
I was driving next
to a store window,

23:28.589 --> 23:31.297
and I stop and look
in my reflection.

23:32.464 --> 23:33.922
I looked like an asshole.

23:33.922 --> 23:36.213
Yes, I'm sure
it was just the car.

23:36.213 --> 23:38.589
A little piece of advice
regarding American culture,

23:38.589 --> 23:42.464
a Corvette takes
a certain sort of man
to be able to pull off.

23:42.464 --> 23:43.839
Like a fedora.

23:43.839 --> 23:45.589
Anyway, keys?

23:47.297 --> 23:49.630
Oh, and now that
I'm out of the company,

23:49.630 --> 23:52.963
you'll need to tell Monica
what transpired.

23:52.963 --> 23:54.005
Thank you.

23:58.130 --> 24:02.255
Gentlemen, I'm off to be
out and about in the 'Vette.

24:02.255 --> 24:04.130
Be back for supper,
that is, of course,

24:04.130 --> 24:07.756
unless I get fucked to death
by the fairer sex.

24:12.756 --> 24:16.547
Gilfoyle, Richard would like
a moment, if you don't mind.

24:18.005 --> 24:19.922
Do you guys need me
to go somewhere else?

24:19.922 --> 24:23.297
No, it's fine.
You can stay.
You can hear this.

24:23.297 --> 24:26.547
Okay, well, Gilfoyle,
I have reviewed
the candidates,

24:26.547 --> 24:30.756
and it is very clear
to me that our company
cannot succeed

24:30.756 --> 24:34.881
without your unrivaled talents
as a systems architect.

24:34.881 --> 24:37.922
So, would you please,
please, please...

24:37.922 --> 24:41.005
please come work
for Pied Piper?

24:42.963 --> 24:44.172
Thanks for asking.

24:44.172 --> 24:48.005
I'm going to put this
as delicately as I know how.

24:48.005 --> 24:49.505
You can chortle my balls.

24:51.714 --> 24:52.756
Okay, well...

24:52.756 --> 24:55.922
so who do we want
to run front-end dev?

24:55.922 --> 24:58.839
"Cunt-ass" or...
"Fuck-jerk"?

25:00.005 --> 25:02.088
Listen.

25:02.088 --> 25:04.172
This thing with Gavin
isn't gonna work without me,

25:04.172 --> 25:05.922
so, because
I feel bad for you

25:05.922 --> 25:07.756
and I'd hate to see
you fuck up good tech,

25:07.756 --> 25:10.172
which will happen
if I'm not there,

25:10.172 --> 25:11.630
I'm willing to help you.

25:11.630 --> 25:13.464
That's a beautiful gesture.

25:13.464 --> 25:16.213
So, you're back aboard.

25:16.213 --> 25:18.505
FYI, Becca Thorton is

25:18.505 --> 25:20.839
a cancerous prolapsed anus
of a human being,

25:20.839 --> 25:23.380
but as a systems engineer,
she's not all bad.

25:26.589 --> 25:27.589
Laurie?

25:27.589 --> 25:29.380
Oh! Yes.
Monica, come in.

25:29.380 --> 25:30.881
I just heard
the good news.

25:30.881 --> 25:32.297
About?

25:32.297 --> 25:34.505
Jian-Yang's nimble pivot.

25:34.505 --> 25:37.005
Back away
from the glass, please.

25:37.005 --> 25:38.380
Special occasion.

25:40.422 --> 25:43.380
He told me
the whole story.

25:43.380 --> 25:45.088
His interview
at Periscope,

25:45.088 --> 25:49.088
his discovery of a photo
of Bachman's genitals
on his phone

25:49.088 --> 25:50.881
when demonstrating
the app,

25:50.881 --> 25:53.422
and his eureka moment
when it turned out

25:53.422 --> 25:55.797
that his
"not hot dog" technology

25:55.797 --> 25:58.756
out-performed Periscope's
own technology.

25:59.839 --> 26:01.589
He said all that?

26:01.589 --> 26:03.005
Not quickly.

26:03.005 --> 26:04.255
The eventual point,

26:04.255 --> 26:06.797
Jian-Yang unwittingly crafted

26:06.797 --> 26:08.839
an amazing tool
for the real-time detection

26:08.839 --> 26:11.839
and filtering
of penile imagery.

26:11.839 --> 26:14.422
And Periscope does have
a dick problem.

26:14.422 --> 26:16.213
Monica.

26:17.130 --> 26:19.922
Jian-Yang went
to Periscope for a job

26:19.922 --> 26:23.172
and walked out
with a $4-million
acquisition offer.

26:23.172 --> 26:25.005
Given our
liquidation preference,

26:25.005 --> 26:27.172
we have 10 X'ed
in two weeks,

26:27.172 --> 26:29.088
so hats off...

26:29.088 --> 26:30.756
Well, thank you
so much.

26:30.756 --> 26:33.797
...to Ed Chen
for his shrewd call,

26:33.797 --> 26:37.714
both to invest in this
and make you lead.

26:37.714 --> 26:40.714
He is quite astute,

26:40.714 --> 26:43.255
which is why we have promoted
him to senior partner.

26:43.255 --> 26:44.589
Yeah.

26:47.088 --> 26:48.922
Monica, you've got Erlich.

26:48.922 --> 26:50.255
I'm here
with Jian-Yang,

26:50.255 --> 26:52.589
and he just told me
that you traded

26:52.589 --> 26:56.963
ten percent of the company
for a used car and a...

26:56.963 --> 26:57.963
A hut.

26:57.963 --> 26:59.380
A hut?

26:59.380 --> 27:01.839
A palapa, and so what?

27:03.839 --> 27:06.797
What do you mean it's
a half-a-million-dollar palapa?

27:08.630 --> 27:12.505
Erlich, is the refrigerator
running?

27:12.505 --> 27:15.672
This is Mike Hunt,
and he's rich.

27:19.881 --> 27:20.963
Shit!

27:24.213 --> 27:26.963
Oh, hey, when you begged
Richard for the job,

27:26.963 --> 27:30.339
did you actually, like,
literally lick his boots,

27:30.339 --> 27:31.797
or did you just go like,

27:31.797 --> 27:33.339
"Pretty please, Richard.

27:33.339 --> 27:35.047
Please can I have
a job, Richard?"

27:35.047 --> 27:37.380
Whatever I did,
it was worth it

27:37.380 --> 27:39.672
for the chance
to work without you.

27:39.672 --> 27:43.672
Speaking of, did your deal
with Periscope ever close?

27:43.672 --> 27:48.380
Yep. If I stay a year,
I vest a big chunk
of Twitter stock.

27:48.380 --> 27:50.255
Great.
Great.

27:50.255 --> 27:54.505
And... what exactly
are you working on?

27:54.505 --> 27:57.839
Oh, you know,
we're tuning...
our algorithm.

27:57.839 --> 28:02.005
We're reconfiguring our...
classifier from food to...

28:04.630 --> 28:06.672
another purpose.

28:06.672 --> 28:12.589
Uh-huh. In other words,
you sit around and look
at dick pics all day long.

28:12.589 --> 28:14.047
Don't let me stop you.

28:17.589 --> 28:19.172
Wow.

28:19.172 --> 28:21.756
I would say,
"Not safe for work,"

28:21.756 --> 28:24.422
but this is your work...

28:24.422 --> 28:26.422
for a year...

28:26.422 --> 28:27.547
at least.

28:32.088 --> 28:33.339
Is that one...

28:34.505 --> 28:36.047
actually a hot dog?

28:39.756 --> 28:40.756
No.

28:42.130 --> 28:44.255
Not hot dog.

peer-to-peer internet,

29:58.088 --> 30:00.213
-uh...
-Everything okay?

30:00.213 --> 30:01.714
I don't know. Is it?

30:01.714 --> 30:03.339
Regular transfusions
of the blood

30:03.339 --> 30:04.672
of a physically fit donor

30:04.672 --> 30:06.881
can significantly retard
the aging process.

30:06.881 --> 30:08.839
And Bryce is
the picture of health.

30:08.839 --> 30:10.839
He looks like
a Nazi propaganda poster.

30:10.839 --> 30:11.839
Oh.

30:13.213 --> 30:15.088
Tequila shots
at a baby shower.

30:15.088 --> 30:16.922
Monica, this is not
a baby shower.

30:16.922 --> 30:17.881
This is a coup.

30:17.881 --> 30:19.339
Get in before you get cut.

30:19.339 --> 30:20.505
What are you talking about?

30:20.797 --> 30:22.505
You said it yourself.
You either bro down,

30:22.505 --> 30:23.505
or you go down.

30:24.005 --> 30:26.005
I didn't say anything
close to that.
