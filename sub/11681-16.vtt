me and Jesse, help us.

18:21.927 --> 18:23.794
If you're not going to,
then don't.

18:23.862 --> 18:25.663
But I can't sit on this list
forever.

18:28.166 --> 18:31.101
All right, I'll let you know
the time and the place.

18:31.169 --> 18:33.837
You and Jesse bring the list.
I'll do what I can.

18:33.905 --> 18:35.239
[ Sighs ]

18:35.307 --> 18:36.473
Good.

18:36.541 --> 18:38.876
Now, if you'll excuse me,

18:38.944 --> 18:42.212
I have more "questionable
activities" to attend to.

18:51.756 --> 18:53.357
Sam: You in the mood
for cooking, Mike?

18:53.425 --> 18:54.758
Because we are making
napalm.

18:54.826 --> 18:57.161
Just want to prep the ground
for this thing with Pete.

18:57.228 --> 18:59.730
Are you prepping it
or torching it?

18:59.798 --> 19:01.498
I thought this was
just a meeting.

19:01.566 --> 19:02.967
Well, look, Pete is a cop.

19:03.034 --> 19:05.869
So I can't backstop you with
a police record that will sell.

19:05.937 --> 19:07.204
You have a clean sheet.

19:07.272 --> 19:09.607
So only way this guys buys you
as a major player

19:09.674 --> 19:11.141
is if we make a splash.

19:11.209 --> 19:13.677
Gasoline
and hydroxyl aluminum.

19:13.745 --> 19:15.145
That's a mighty hard sell.

19:15.213 --> 19:18.182
Yeah, well, he killed my friend.
So it's a special occasion.

19:18.249 --> 19:21.719
<i>Napalm, or gelled fuel, is best</i>
<i>known for its use in bombs.</i>

19:21.786 --> 19:23.954
<i>But it's essentially</i>
<i>just gasoline</i>

19:24.022 --> 19:26.123
<i>that has been</i>
<i>chemically altered</i>

19:26.191 --> 19:28.459
<i>to make it sticky</i>
<i>and easier to control.</i>

19:28.526 --> 19:30.961
<i>It can be used</i>
<i>in explosive devices.</i>

19:31.029 --> 19:33.831
<i>But it can also be used</i>
<i>in any situation</i>

19:33.898 --> 19:37.034
<i>where you need to control</i>
<i>the shape and size of a flame,</i>

19:37.102 --> 19:40.070
<i>which makes it very useful</i>
<i>in forest-fire work,</i>

19:40.138 --> 19:42.573
<i>building demolition,</i>
<i>and any situation</i>

19:42.641 --> 19:44.575
<i>where you want to scare</i>
<i>the hell out of someone.</i>

19:44.643 --> 19:46.877
Oh, yeah.

19:46.945 --> 19:48.512
Okay, Mike.
All right, Mike.

19:48.580 --> 19:49.913
That's the last batch.

19:49.981 --> 19:51.382
Get yourself ready.
Look sharp.

19:51.449 --> 19:53.984
And, uh, don't wear
any synthetic fibers.

19:58.957 --> 20:02.593
Mike, try and stay in my line
of sight, will you?

20:02.661 --> 20:05.663
Every time we do this, you act
like I can shoot around corners.

20:05.730 --> 20:06.997
I got it, Sam.

20:07.065 --> 20:09.266
Just stay loose,
go with the moment.

20:09.334 --> 20:11.335
Like jazz,
only with a sniper

20:11.403 --> 20:13.470
and five gallons of napalm.
Exactly.

20:15.473 --> 20:16.507
He's here.
Right on time.

20:18.543 --> 20:20.277
Hey, Pete.
Ray grant.

20:20.345 --> 20:22.046
I'm the guy your buddy Ted
told you about.

20:22.113 --> 20:24.515
Where's Ted?
He said he would be here.

20:24.582 --> 20:27.084
Ted's not partaking
in this transaction.

20:27.152 --> 20:28.552
I cut out the middleman.

20:31.122 --> 20:33.157
The hell is that supposed to mean?!
I cut his throat.

20:33.224 --> 20:36.060
You what?!
You killed him? Are you crazy?

20:36.127 --> 20:39.196
Petey, Petey, Petey.
Relax. His loss is your gain.

20:39.264 --> 20:40.464
You are now inheriting

20:40.532 --> 20:42.866
a direct-distribution deal --
boom.

20:42.934 --> 20:45.769
We can sell your product
together, just the two of us.

20:45.837 --> 20:47.805
[ Chuckles ]

20:47.872 --> 20:50.274
Yeah, forget it.

20:50.341 --> 20:52.009
Deal's off.

20:52.077 --> 20:54.978
Where the hell you think you're going?
I'm leaving.

20:55.046 --> 20:57.481
Look, man, this was supposed
to be between you, me, and Ted.

20:57.549 --> 20:59.416
Now I found out
u killed Ted.

20:59.484 --> 21:01.351
I'm not gonna do some sort of deal
with some guy I don't even know.

21:01.419 --> 21:03.554
You never heard of me
because I've never been caught.

21:03.621 --> 21:05.389
I've never been caught
because I'm careful.

21:05.457 --> 21:08.192
That means if a junkie loser
comes to me with a deal,

21:08.259 --> 21:11.962
I'm smart enough to kill him
before he starts jawing off.

21:12.030 --> 21:14.465
Just like when a dirty cop
comes to me with a deal,

21:14.532 --> 21:16.800
that dirty cop doesn't get
to walk away!

21:23.007 --> 21:24.808
What the hell?!

21:24.876 --> 21:27.678
This is just so we can have
a private conversation.

21:27.746 --> 21:30.047
I call this
the ring of trust.

21:30.115 --> 21:32.616
And you can trust
that you won't leave this ring

21:32.684 --> 21:35.185
without us having a deal.

21:35.253 --> 21:37.755
Now, I've got money.
You've got product.

21:37.822 --> 21:39.423
Are we going to do business
together?

21:42.093 --> 21:43.327
Yeah.
Let's do some business.

21:43.394 --> 21:44.862
Fantastic!
Let's do that!

21:48.688 --> 21:51.613
Fine Pete. Fine.
But if you change things up again

21:51.639 --> 21:53.206
you're gonna hurt
my feelings.

21:53.274 --> 21:56.809
And then, who knows? I might
have to hurt your everything.

21:58.612 --> 22:01.281
He's in,
but he's not making it easy.

22:01.348 --> 22:04.284
He keeps changing the place
and time of the meeting.

22:04.351 --> 22:06.552
Well, what's the problem?
Honestly?

22:06.620 --> 22:09.555
Our little fire stunt kind of
worked a little too well.

22:09.623 --> 22:10.890
He's too scared
to make a move.

22:10.958 --> 22:12.558
Well, if he's freaking out
that bad,

22:12.626 --> 22:15.161
what are the odds he just flushes
the drugs and walks away clean?

22:15.229 --> 22:17.764
Pretty high unless
we pick up the pace.

22:17.831 --> 22:20.967
Well, you got a plan?
Yeah, but you're not gonna like it.

22:21.035 --> 22:24.070
Pete had Kevin killed, but
he never actually saw the body.

22:24.138 --> 22:26.439
You want to pretend
Kevin's still alive?

22:26.507 --> 22:27.874
You're right.
I hate that idea.

22:27.942 --> 22:30.310
Do you have any idea
what that would do to Claire?

22:30.377 --> 22:33.179
Sam, I wish there was another way.
Other than raising the dead

22:33.247 --> 22:35.214
and forcing a grieving widow
to play along?

22:35.282 --> 22:37.350
Pete's too paranoid
to make the deal right now.

22:37.418 --> 22:39.085
But we can motivate him
through fear,

22:39.153 --> 22:40.687
and there's nothing
he'll fear more

22:40.754 --> 22:41.955
than finding out
Kevin's alive.

22:48.529 --> 22:50.096
I'll call Claire.

It's just for a little while,

23:02.676 --> 23:04.644
Just long enough
to get Pete to move the drugs.

23:04.712 --> 23:07.080
And I promise you, the second
he brings them into the open,

23:07.147 --> 23:08.314
we shut him down for good.

23:08.382 --> 23:10.817
What exactly
do I have to do?

23:11.919 --> 23:14.220
Well, we're gonna need
a few of his things,

make it look like he's in town,
hiding out.

23:16.323 --> 23:17.824

pretending like he gives a damn.

23:20.260 --> 23:21.961
Well, that's
the harder part.

23:22.029 --> 23:23.496

just avoid him.

I mean, you've got to work it.
You got to play it.

like you got a secret call

but you can't talk about it.

Him? Who's him?

Kevin. Who do you think
owns this boat?

24:28.695 --> 24:30.363
Kevin was here.
I mean, he was just here.

Hell, the fries
are still warm.

He told me not to come.
He said it was too dangerous.

got friends in his camp, you know?

Anyway, I don't know
all the details,

I didn't know
if he was dead or alive.

His ticket back in
isn't a sure thing.

he didn't say anything.

you won't have to be wondering
whether he's dead or alive,

38:22.186 --> 38:23.686
When are you gonna learn

38:23.754 --> 38:26.256
you can't hide everything
from your mother?

38:26.323 --> 38:27.490
Mom, I'm sorry.

38:27.558 --> 38:29.158
You're a grown man.

38:29.226 --> 38:32.128
I know you want to go back into your old job.
I understand that.

38:32.196 --> 38:35.131
No, I mean I'm sorry that
you didn't find out from me.

38:35.199 --> 38:39.702
The last time I left,
I hurt people. I know that.

38:39.770 --> 38:41.237
But I was trying
to protect them.

38:41.305 --> 38:44.841
People...Like to say goodbye,
Michael.

38:44.909 --> 38:47.477
Well, who knows? Maybe
this time, we won't have to.

38:47.544 --> 38:51.781
But whatever I decide...
I will let you know.

38:51.849 --> 38:54.183
Okay.

39:00.791 --> 39:04.494
All right. Finished fixing up
my filing cabinet, Mrs. Westen.

39:04.561 --> 39:06.863
Garage is good as new.
You ready, Mike?

39:06.931 --> 39:08.798
Yeah.

39:08.866 --> 39:10.366
Marv's got
a Homeland Security team

39:10.434 --> 39:11.801
waiting to secure
the handoff.

39:11.869 --> 39:13.503
This thing is encrypted
till doomsday.

39:13.570 --> 39:14.971
We can forget
about making copies

39:15.039 --> 39:16.773
unless you've got
a supercomputer handy.

39:16.840 --> 39:17.941
Probably
for the best, then.

39:18.008 --> 39:19.208
Yeah.
Let's go.

39:19.276 --> 39:20.343
Good luck, boys.

39:28.585 --> 39:31.387
This is it?
This is the list?

39:31.455 --> 39:33.890
In all its glory. You know, these
guys shouldn't just escort you

39:33.958 --> 39:36.626
to the airport, Marv --
they should fly with you.

39:36.694 --> 39:38.528
That thing
is dangerous, man.

39:38.595 --> 39:39.996
It's all taken care of.

39:41.632 --> 39:42.865
I'll keep in touch.

39:44.134 --> 39:45.268
Who you taking it to?

39:46.737 --> 39:48.004
I shouldn't say.

39:49.406 --> 39:50.840
It's for your own
protection.

39:55.379 --> 39:59.582
<i>It's standard protocol</i>
<i>for a homeland security officer</i>

39:59.650 --> 40:02.618
<i>escorting classified materials</i>
<i>to be armed.</i>

40:02.686 --> 40:06.255
<i>Less standard for their arms</i>
<i>to have silencers.</i>

40:07.958 --> 40:10.727
Marv,
who are these guys?

40:10.794 --> 40:13.296
Jesse, I'm sorry.
They threatened me.

40:13.364 --> 40:15.331
They -- they said
that they would kill my wife.

40:15.366 --> 40:17.166
Marv, what the hell are you
talking about? What's going on?

40:21.038 --> 40:23.306
Man: Back off!
Hands in the air! No! No!

40:27.411 --> 40:29.479
I'm not letting them
get away.

40:29.546 --> 40:31.447
[ Tires screech ]
Jesse, wait!

40:46.830 --> 40:48.197
[ Tires screech ]

40:48.265 --> 40:50.099
Brennen.

40:50.167 --> 40:52.335
You know this guy?
Who the hell is he?

40:52.403 --> 40:54.437
Our worst nightmare.
