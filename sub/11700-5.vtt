WEBVTT

00:02.254 --> 00:04.054
All right. Here you go.

00:04.090 --> 00:06.858
A perfect omelet for my perfect girlfriend.

00:06.892 --> 00:07.892
Just get all that...

00:09.829 --> 00:13.865
Aw! You got all the shells out this time.

00:13.899 --> 00:16.735
It's amazing.
You know, Danny moves to Paris,

00:16.769 --> 00:19.704
and all of my food is still being
eaten by people who aren't me.

00:19.739 --> 00:21.339
(Laughs)

00:21.374 --> 00:22.607
Hey, have either of you talked to him?

00:22.641 --> 00:25.377
Danny? Me? Nope.
No, I haven't seen him either,

00:25.411 --> 00:27.278
which that would be impossible
because he's in Paris.

00:27.313 --> 00:29.214
And God, what is with all the questions?

00:29.248 --> 00:32.116
Okay, that's enough coffee for you.

00:32.151 --> 00:36.888
Oh. And ironically, there's just not
enough coffee for me. That's so weird.

00:36.922 --> 00:40.025
Seriously, you guys need to
start staying at Riley's place.

00:40.059 --> 00:43.661
Okay. Hint taken. Don't worry.
We'll hang out at Riley's house tonight.

00:43.696 --> 00:46.865
- Is that cool?
- Yes. So cool.

00:48.567 --> 00:53.338
Lights, camera, Emma!

00:54.407 --> 00:56.474
My money problems are over.

00:56.509 --> 01:02.113
I've created a new web series:
Emma-personations.

01:02.148 --> 01:05.917
Up first, it's Charlie chaplin.
He's young, he's fresh...

01:05.951 --> 01:07.819
He's been dead 50 years.

01:07.853 --> 01:10.822
Yeah, well,
I don't care what you people think.

01:10.856 --> 01:15.693
If I did, I wouldn't have a back tattoo
of Jon Bon Jovi riding a unicorn.

01:15.728 --> 01:20.432
Never thought I'd have to say this, but,
mom, please wash that mustache off my baby.

01:20.466 --> 01:23.401
(Scoffs) Fine.
But I don't see what you're so worried about.

01:23.436 --> 01:26.271
I mean, it's not like it's... permanent.

01:26.305 --> 01:28.239
- Oh, you get that off my baby right now!
- I will get it off!

01:28.274 --> 01:29.374
- It is washable. It's a sharpie.
- I'm gonna go

01:29.408 --> 01:31.276
straighten up a few things my place.

01:31.310 --> 01:33.211
I, uh... I left something on the couch.

01:33.245 --> 01:35.080
- Baby!
- Well, she's washable too!

01:35.114 --> 01:38.149
Maybe I'll wash this one off.
That real? I don't know.

01:40.219 --> 01:41.786
You've gotta get out.

01:42.822 --> 01:44.923

01:44.957 --> 01:47.992

Riley: <i> Danny, you can't keep sleeping on my couch.</i>

01:57.069 --> 02:00.805
What am I supposed to do? Tell everyone
that I'm hiding at my best friend's house

02:00.840 --> 02:02.807
because my girlfriend dumped me?

02:02.842 --> 02:06.811
That I cried on a plane, and had to
be consoled by an eight-year-old boy?

02:06.846 --> 02:10.747
Yes, that would be great,

02:10.782 --> 02:13.785
but maybe leave me hiding you out of it.

02:13.819 --> 02:16.087
You don't wanna over-truth them.

02:16.122 --> 02:17.822
It's too embarrassing.

02:17.857 --> 02:19.023
I'm supposed to be in France.

02:19.058 --> 02:20.091
I mean, I learned how to say

02:20.126 --> 02:22.760
<i>buenos dias </i> for nothing.

02:23.863 --> 02:25.830
I can't keep this up any longer.

02:25.865 --> 02:27.765
All right? I'm done hiding you.

02:27.800 --> 02:28.933
- (Knock on door)
- Hey, it's Ben.

02:28.968 --> 02:30.768
Hide!

02:32.004 --> 02:33.872
Ben! Hi! Nothing's going on.

02:33.906 --> 02:35.974
You know, just in case you were gonna ask.

02:36.008 --> 02:37.775
You were in such a hurry

02:37.810 --> 02:39.077
to leave this morning,
you forgot your laptop,

02:39.111 --> 02:41.112
so I just figured I'd drop
it off on my way to work.

02:41.147 --> 02:43.848
Get in good with the
boyfriend-of-the-year people.

02:43.883 --> 02:46.918
Aw, that is so sweet. Okay, bye.

02:46.952 --> 02:51.089
Do you really think it a good idea
to invite Ben over when I'm here?

02:51.123 --> 02:53.124
Hey, babe,
should I bring over a movie or something?

02:53.159 --> 02:54.859
Yeah, pizza would be great. Love you.

02:56.829 --> 02:58.830
- You can't be here!
- (Door thuds)

02:58.864 --> 02:59.831
You say something?

02:59.865 --> 03:03.835
Make sure you grab beer.

03:03.869 --> 03:05.803
Great idea. I'll see you tonight.

03:05.838 --> 03:07.038
Actually, tonight...

03:07.072 --> 03:08.840
Tonight is gonna be a little tricky.

03:08.874 --> 03:10.875
I have this deposition thingy.

03:10.910 --> 03:14.746
But tomorrow...
Tomorrow is gonna be trick-free.

03:14.780 --> 03:17.749
Okay,
but I bet you'll be guilty of missing me.

03:17.783 --> 03:19.651
I'm not guilty of anything!

03:19.685 --> 03:22.887
And I'm going now.

03:22.922 --> 03:26.491
- You have to go.
- Ben: I know! I'm leaving!

03:29.528 --> 03:31.362
(Spanish accent) Lucy,

03:31.397 --> 03:35.300
you have some "splainin'" to do!

03:35.334 --> 03:37.101
Okay, Emma, you need to focus.

03:37.136 --> 03:41.105
Okay.
The one time I need a "wah," I get nothing.

03:41.140 --> 03:44.976
I get nothing. Look, just do it one take
my way, and then you can play with it.

03:45.010 --> 03:46.778
Okay?

03:46.812 --> 03:48.713
Well, it looks like my days

03:48.747 --> 03:50.682
at <i> the Mary Hart show </i> are numbered.

03:50.716 --> 03:51.783
Mary wants to meet for lunch,

03:51.817 --> 03:53.751
which can only mean one of two things:

03:53.786 --> 03:56.654
She wants to fire me or sleep with me.

03:56.689 --> 03:59.390
Trust me, it's fire you.

03:59.425 --> 04:02.427
But if you want to save your job,

04:02.461 --> 04:07.265
how about putting this
red-headed cutie on your show?

04:07.299 --> 04:09.334
I know trying to pay your rent

04:09.368 --> 04:12.103
with a baby in a wig seems like a good idea,

04:12.137 --> 04:14.973
but maybe you should get a real job.
(Laughs)

04:15.007 --> 04:18.142
I have a real job.
I'm just not doing real good at it.

04:18.177 --> 04:20.911
Well, I'm not real surprised. (Laughs)

04:22.014 --> 04:24.749
- Oh...
- I know.

04:24.783 --> 04:29.487
Emma, how about we use our
powers of persuasion on Mary?

04:29.521 --> 04:31.723
Yours is your laugh and your smile,
and mine is...

04:31.757 --> 04:34.392
Well I think that's obvious.

04:37.263 --> 04:39.330
Tucker, I want you to do something for me

04:39.365 --> 04:41.366
that may make you feel
a little uncomfortable,

04:41.400 --> 04:43.268
but I want you to be open-minded.

04:43.302 --> 04:47.939
Oh, wow.
(Laughs) I thought I was gonna get fired.

04:47.973 --> 04:51.876
Oh, fair warning,
I have had a lot of garlic in my salad, so...

04:51.910 --> 04:54.679
Fire you? I need you.

04:54.713 --> 04:58.783
Yeah. Yeah, I got that. Let's do this.

04:58.817 --> 05:02.420
Tucker,
I want to have regular people on my show.

05:02.454 --> 05:03.521
Regular people?

05:03.555 --> 05:05.523
I'm tired of interviewing celebrities.

05:05.557 --> 05:08.493
All they ever want talk about
are their movies and vacations.

05:08.527 --> 05:11.329
I get it, you're almost as rich as me.

05:11.363 --> 05:14.265
(Laughs) You know what you need, Mary?

05:14.300 --> 05:16.100
An average Joe with a juicy story,

05:16.135 --> 05:18.936
or I'll fire my producer,
and that's you, Tucker.

05:18.971 --> 05:21.139
I was gonna say a drink. (Laughs)

05:21.173 --> 05:23.975
But thanks for the not-so-veiled threat.

05:24.009 --> 05:26.944
Oh, um, so just so we're clear,

05:26.979 --> 05:28.780
you don't want to sleep with me?

05:28.814 --> 05:31.616
I never said that.

05:38.424 --> 05:39.524
Hey, Tuck, what's up?

05:39.558 --> 05:41.459
Oh, you know, just watching my career

05:41.493 --> 05:44.495
- blow up before my eyes.
- Cool. So, do you know what's up with Riley?

05:44.530 --> 05:46.230
She's definitely acting weird, right?

05:46.265 --> 05:48.166
Ben, I could lose my job.

05:48.200 --> 05:50.968
Maybe it's all in my head.
What do you think?

05:51.003 --> 05:52.837
I think you're a terrible listener.

05:52.871 --> 05:55.907
Yeah.
Yeah, you're right, it's probably nothing.

05:55.941 --> 05:58.009
Ben! I'm probably gonna get fired!

05:58.043 --> 06:01.579
Well, what do you expect,
bringing my mom to lunch with Mary?

06:01.613 --> 06:04.449
- What?
- Help me, Mary Hart.

06:04.483 --> 06:08.353
You're my only hope. Help me, Mary Hart.

06:08.387 --> 06:11.422
- You're my only...
- No, no, no, no, no, no! Step away from the Mary.

06:11.457 --> 06:16.361
What? Please. Mary and I are old buds.
Right, mare-mare?

06:16.395 --> 06:19.097
Why is it touching me?

06:19.131 --> 06:21.165
Because it has no boundaries.

06:21.200 --> 06:24.902
Well, you know what it does have? Feelings,

06:24.937 --> 06:26.871
and you hurt all of them.

06:26.905 --> 06:30.742
And to think,
I was gonna offer you a cinnamon bun.

06:35.948 --> 06:37.749
You promise you'll be out by tomorrow?

06:37.783 --> 06:39.650
Yes, absolutely.

06:39.685 --> 06:42.387
Unless I can't, then I won't.

06:42.421 --> 06:46.257
Are you sure it's smart to be cutting
through the alley behind the bar?

06:46.291 --> 06:49.360
Smarter than walking in the front of the bar.
What if we ran into...

06:49.395 --> 06:52.063
Ben! Ben! Ben! Hi! Oh my God! Hi!

06:52.097 --> 06:54.999
- What are you doing here?
- Uh... working.

06:55.033 --> 06:56.100
Isn't that what you're supposed to be doing?

06:56.135 --> 06:58.870
Yes, but, uh,

06:58.904 --> 07:00.972
I wanted to surprise you.

07:01.006 --> 07:02.840
Surprise! (Laughs)

07:02.875 --> 07:05.977
Aw, that's so sweet.
I've got a surprise for you too.

07:07.980 --> 07:11.616
That probably would've been more
romantic if I wasn't holding garbage.

07:11.650 --> 07:15.553
Okay, well, surprise over.
I gotta get back to work.

07:15.587 --> 07:17.588
But I will see you tomorrow night.

07:17.623 --> 07:19.290
Okay.

07:20.426 --> 07:22.226
- Gimme the bag!
- (Screams)

07:22.261 --> 07:24.295
- Ben: Let go of her!
- Stop!

07:24.329 --> 07:26.130
- Ben!
- Ben: Call 911!

07:26.165 --> 07:27.432
Phone, phone, phone! Oh!

07:27.466 --> 07:29.167
Ooh, pepper spray!

07:29.201 --> 07:31.235
- Eat spray, dirtbag!
- Oh, my eyes!

07:31.270 --> 07:33.905
- Oh, God, I'm so sorry!
- Oh! Oh!

07:33.939 --> 07:37.875
- Ben: Oh!
- Mugger: Ah!

07:37.910 --> 07:41.913
Riley? Are you there?

07:41.947 --> 07:44.582
Honey, I'm here! I'm here!

07:44.616 --> 07:45.850
Did I get him?

07:49.542 --> 07:50.104
Dude,

07:50.204 --> 07:52.105
I can't believe you knocked that guy out.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.074
Riley's really lucky you were there.

07:54.108 --> 07:56.042
Well, it's hard to say who knocked out who,

07:56.077 --> 07:59.779
but fists were flying
and heads were locking.

07:59.814 --> 08:02.949
People might say I put the "he" in "hero."

08:02.984 --> 08:05.652
Nobody would say that.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.754
Oh my God.

08:07.788 --> 08:11.691
You're someone ordinary who
did something extraordinary.

08:11.726 --> 08:14.427
Dude, we gotta get you on <i> the
Mary Hart show </i> immediately!

08:14.462 --> 08:16.463
Millions-ish of people will
want to hear your story.

08:16.497 --> 08:19.165
Oh, yeah, know what? No.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.201
I... no,
I don't want to make millions of guys

08:21.235 --> 08:23.403
feel insecure because I'm so awesome.

08:23.437 --> 08:26.172
- What?
- Have you seen this?

08:26.207 --> 08:28.975
"Girl saves wimpy boyfriend."

08:29.010 --> 08:32.111
- Is this about Ben?
- That story could be about anybody.

08:32.145 --> 08:33.913
Nope. No, it says right here,

08:33.948 --> 08:35.849
"Ben Wheeler, wimpy boyfriend,

08:35.883 --> 08:39.653
was saved by his girlfriend, Riley Perrin."

08:39.687 --> 08:41.655
I was pepper-sprayed!

08:41.688 --> 08:44.758
Okay, look, maybe you should
spend less time making excuses,

08:44.792 --> 08:47.494
and more time helping me
get Riley to do the show.

08:47.528 --> 08:50.230
It was just a mugger in an alley.
Nobody cares.

08:50.264 --> 08:53.400
America cares!
They love a tough chick story.

08:53.434 --> 08:55.201
They also love cats who ride Roombas,

08:55.236 --> 08:58.104
but, you know,
since I don't have a cat or a Roomba,

08:58.139 --> 08:59.939
I need the girl who knocked out the guy.

08:59.974 --> 09:02.042
And apparently scared off a second guy.

09:02.076 --> 09:03.910
What second guy? There wasn't a second guy.

09:03.944 --> 09:07.847
Some witness saw a second guy
fleeing the alley, and he was huge.

09:07.882 --> 09:09.716
Riley didn't say anything
about a second guy.

09:09.750 --> 09:12.519
No, it says it right here.
Right after the part

09:12.553 --> 09:15.488
about how the police found you
rolled up in a ball, crying.

09:15.523 --> 09:16.623
I gotta remember to cut this out

09:16.657 --> 09:19.426
- for my Christmas letter.
- Tucker: Oh yeah.

09:19.460 --> 09:23.496
Did you see this?
This article is calling me "The Perrinator."

09:23.531 --> 09:28.201
Granted, that's really clever, but...
Oh, God, I'm in too deep.

09:28.235 --> 09:32.939
I just need enough time to think of a
believable excuse as to why I'm back,

09:32.973 --> 09:36.076
like... France was closed.

09:38.112 --> 09:39.846
They know about the second guy.

09:39.880 --> 09:41.915
- What second guy?
- You, Danny.

09:41.949 --> 09:45.618
You are the second guy.
Please, you have to tell the truth.

09:45.653 --> 09:47.520
Hey, did you see that article?

09:47.555 --> 09:48.755
Oh my God! Ben!

09:48.789 --> 09:51.491
Thank you so much for saving me!

09:51.525 --> 09:54.327
You are just, oh,
the best boyfriend in the world.

09:54.362 --> 09:56.463
True.

09:56.497 --> 09:59.499
We both know I didn't do the saving.
Now everyone else does too.

09:59.533 --> 10:01.534
I can't believe you knocked
him out with one punch.

10:01.569 --> 10:05.105
Well, it was my favorite purse.

10:05.139 --> 10:07.340
Oh, but you have to know I
did not talk to that reporter.

10:07.375 --> 10:09.976
Okay, good, then make sure you
don't do Tucker's show either.

10:10.010 --> 10:12.045
I don't need the rest of the world knowing
how you made me look like an idiot.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.748
God, I would never do Tucker's show.

10:14.782 --> 10:17.784
Wait, I'm sorry,
I made you look like an idiot?

10:17.818 --> 10:20.854
Uh, yeah, having your girlfriend be
tougher than you is not exactly cool.

10:20.888 --> 10:22.722
Oh, well, you know what else isn't cool?

10:22.757 --> 10:25.558
Having a boyfriend that still hasn't asked,
"hey, are you okay?"

10:25.593 --> 10:27.394
Or "did you get hurt?"

10:27.428 --> 10:29.295
Well,
if you weren't so busy shoving it in my face

10:29.330 --> 10:31.297
and shouting it from the rooftops,
maybe I would've.

10:31.332 --> 10:34.167
Oh, did your big,
tough girlfriend embarrass you?

10:34.201 --> 10:37.237
Uh, yeah, she kinda did.
And I'm kind of waiting for her to apologize.

10:37.271 --> 10:40.306
Oh, okay. Well, you know what? Maybe I'll
do it this afternoon on Tucker's show.

10:40.341 --> 10:43.943
- You wouldn't dare.
- Oh, I dare, all right. You just watch me dare.

10:43.978 --> 10:46.780
Oh, I am so out of here.

10:46.814 --> 10:49.883
And in case it wasn't clear,
our date is officially canceled.

10:51.952 --> 10:54.721
- (Knock on door)
- What?

10:56.590 --> 10:57.724
New phonebook's here.

10:59.727 --> 11:01.561
Oh. And get a few shots of the dumpster

11:01.595 --> 11:03.396
just in case we need some transitions.

11:03.431 --> 11:05.532
I know Mary wants real people,

11:05.566 --> 11:09.235
but real people get real boring real fast.

11:10.438 --> 11:12.172
Bonnie: Hoo!

11:12.206 --> 11:14.908
Boy, is it hot out here.

11:14.942 --> 11:19.779
I guess I'm just gonna have to fan
myself with these Knicks tickets.

11:21.115 --> 11:22.882
The season ended three weeks ago.

11:22.917 --> 11:24.984
Oh! Tucker, come on!

11:25.019 --> 11:27.620
Please, I'm begging you! I'm broke!

11:27.655 --> 11:30.824
This would make Emma famous and me rich.

11:30.858 --> 11:34.427
Of course I care more about the
first thing than the second.

11:34.462 --> 11:36.463
Wait, what did I say first?

11:36.497 --> 11:40.200
Look,
I know this is gonna be hard for you to hear,

11:40.234 --> 11:42.101
so I'm gonna say it delicately.

11:43.103 --> 11:46.039
Hell to the no! Okay?

11:46.073 --> 11:48.007
Wait, what is that?

11:48.042 --> 11:49.209
Wait, is this a security camera?

11:49.243 --> 11:54.047
Oh, yeah. I found out the hard
way the bar had one of those.

11:54.081 --> 11:56.916
The fry cook and I used to take
all of his breaks back here...

11:56.951 --> 11:59.953
Then I had to take a break with the
night manager to get the tapes back.

11:59.987 --> 12:03.490
(Laughs) That was a good week for me.

12:03.524 --> 12:05.558
- Wait, can you do that again?
- Well, I'd love to,

12:05.593 --> 12:08.394
but Raul moved away and
George was a terrible kisser.

12:08.429 --> 12:12.532
No, I mean get me the security
footage of the mugging.

12:12.566 --> 12:16.102
You do that, and I will let you exploit

12:16.136 --> 12:18.304
your granddaughter on national TV.

12:18.339 --> 12:21.007
You had me at "exploit."

12:22.977 --> 12:27.146
Raul? Hey! How's Ohio, huh?

12:28.816 --> 12:29.883
Get back here!

12:34.259 --> 12:36.226
I am here to avenge my girlfriend.

12:36.261 --> 12:38.295
You take her purse, I take your life.

12:43.168 --> 12:45.903
This is what you do when
I'm watching your kid?

12:45.937 --> 12:47.171
Here, baby.

12:47.205 --> 12:49.106
- You know I could take him, right?
- Oh, yeah.

12:49.140 --> 12:52.743
But if he teams up with and beary
and squirrely, you're a goner.

12:52.777 --> 12:56.813
Mom, you know I tried to
take out that mugger, right?

12:56.848 --> 12:59.783
- I do.
- And you know how much it hurts to get pepper-sprayed, right?

12:59.817 --> 13:01.785
I do.

13:01.819 --> 13:03.754
And you know that Riley's
being a terrible girlfriend

13:03.788 --> 13:06.390
by making me look like a
coward on national TV, right?

13:06.424 --> 13:10.127
- I don't.
- Thank you. Wait, what?

13:10.161 --> 13:12.429
Ben, if you were the one who saved the day,

13:12.463 --> 13:15.332
do you think Riley would be upset
because you got all the credit?

13:15.366 --> 13:18.168
- No, that's different.
- Oh, okay, what's different?

13:18.203 --> 13:20.804
Is it because she's the weak, timid girl,

13:20.838 --> 13:24.675
- and you're the big, strong man?
- Exactly.

13:24.709 --> 13:26.977
Why don't you just tell
that to your daughter?

13:27.011 --> 13:30.514
Let her know that little girls
can't grow up to be heroes.

13:30.548 --> 13:31.815
And, while you're at it,

13:31.849 --> 13:34.651
un-invent someone called Wonder Woman.

13:39.290 --> 13:42.226
Okay. I see what you're trying to do.

13:42.260 --> 13:44.962
You want me to say it out loud,
so I hear how stupid it sounds.

13:44.996 --> 13:47.130
Well, I don't need to say it
out loud to know it's stupid,

13:47.165 --> 13:49.099
so your whole trick backfired.

13:49.133 --> 13:51.768
- No.
- Now, if you'll excuse me,

13:51.803 --> 13:54.705
I'm going to go talk to Riley about
nothing related to this conversation.

13:54.739 --> 13:57.741
Here you go. Okay,
apparently after I give someone a bottle.

13:57.775 --> 13:59.910
No, you know what?
I'd just prefer a glass of Chardonnay.

14:01.879 --> 14:04.615
Do not stop smiling,
do not raise your voice,

14:04.649 --> 14:06.717
do not reference historical events,

14:06.751 --> 14:10.287
and do not say the word "moist," okay?

14:10.321 --> 14:13.290
But other than that, you know,
just be yourself and have a great time.

14:13.324 --> 14:15.425
Riley, hey, can we talk for,
like, two seconds?

14:15.460 --> 14:20.063
Oh, sorry, but I'm about to be really busy
bad-mouthing you in front of millions of people.

14:20.098 --> 14:22.065
Riley, I'm sorry.

14:22.100 --> 14:23.967
I was wrong.

14:24.002 --> 14:25.135
You need to tell people the truth,

14:25.169 --> 14:26.770
and I want to support you while you do.

14:28.773 --> 14:30.674
Oh...

14:30.708 --> 14:32.609
Well, apology accepted.

14:32.644 --> 14:33.844
So I think we're just going to go.

14:33.878 --> 14:36.580
Wait, no! No one is going anywhere! Okay?

14:36.614 --> 14:40.417
Except live to sad,
lonely housewives across America.

14:40.451 --> 14:43.387
Can we get a chair for the wimpy boyfriend?

14:43.421 --> 14:47.391
This is important to me.
Can you not see how moist my forehead is?

14:47.425 --> 14:50.227
- Tucker!
- Oh my God!

14:50.261 --> 14:53.030
What did I tell you about that word?

14:55.900 --> 14:57.868
You must be Riley and Ben.

14:57.902 --> 15:00.737
I've never said this to anybody
who wasn't a celebrity before,

15:00.772 --> 15:01.805
but... hello.

15:04.676 --> 15:06.677
Okay, everyone, take your seats.
Ready, Mary? All right.

15:06.711 --> 15:10.781
And we are live in five, four, three...

15:10.815 --> 15:13.617
Hello, America, I'm Mary Hart.

15:13.651 --> 15:18.355
Today, on <i>the Mary Hart show,</i>
you'll hear the story of two normal people.

15:18.389 --> 15:23.427
That's right. These people are
not famous or talented in any way.

15:23.461 --> 15:26.963
Meet Riley Perrin and Ben Wheeler.

15:26.998 --> 15:30.834
Why don't you two tell us your unusual tale?

15:30.868 --> 15:35.706
Um...
Well, you know, nothing really to tell.

15:35.740 --> 15:39.509
Just, New York, muggers... (Mumbles)

15:39.544 --> 15:42.412
Okay, let's try the boy one.

15:42.447 --> 15:45.515
Actually, Mary,
it's a pretty incredible story.

15:45.550 --> 15:50.287
Um, this independent,
tough woman saved my life,

15:50.321 --> 15:51.521
and that's the truth.

15:51.556 --> 15:53.490
Right, Riley? Tell her.

15:53.524 --> 15:56.126
I don't know... (Mumbles)

15:56.160 --> 15:58.295
(Whispering)

16:00.965 --> 16:02.999
Well, somebody better tell me something,

16:03.034 --> 16:05.769
or somebody else is going to get fired.

16:05.803 --> 16:07.704
That's you, Tucker.

16:08.940 --> 16:10.941
Here, here, I got the tape.

16:10.975 --> 16:12.743
Oh my God! I would kiss you,

16:12.777 --> 16:15.612
but I don't want to make Mary jealous.

16:17.482 --> 16:19.616
Well, in a surprising turn of events,

16:19.650 --> 16:23.286
<i>the Mary Hart show </i> has
obtained exclusive rights

16:23.321 --> 16:26.189
to the security footage
of the actual mugging.

16:26.224 --> 16:28.225
- The security what... what?
- Let's roll the tape.

16:28.259 --> 16:30.560
Wait, wait! Wait!

16:30.595 --> 16:32.229
You can't roll the tape.

16:32.263 --> 16:36.032
I didn't save anybody.

16:36.067 --> 16:37.968
Danny did it.

16:38.002 --> 16:40.003
What are you talking about?
Danny's in Paris.

16:40.037 --> 16:41.838
Is he?

16:41.873 --> 16:43.840
Or was he there for, like, six hours,

16:43.875 --> 16:45.942
and now he's back in New York and 
living with me?

16:45.977 --> 16:47.878
The answer may surprise you.

16:47.912 --> 16:49.780
You're living with my brother?

16:49.814 --> 16:52.382
Finally, this story gets good.

16:52.417 --> 16:54.684
Wait, Danny's been back this whole time?

16:54.719 --> 16:57.254
So you've been lying to my face for days?

16:57.288 --> 16:59.423
Just so we're all clear,
you're feeling used,

16:59.457 --> 17:02.259
humiliated, betrayed?

17:02.293 --> 17:04.428
Yeah. Yeah, that pretty much covers it.

17:04.462 --> 17:08.031
Ben, wait, hey, I can explain.

17:08.065 --> 17:10.300
It was lovely meeting you.

17:12.869 --> 17:15.806
Real people, real emotions.

17:15.839 --> 17:18.008
That's what <i> the Mary Hart show </i>
is all about.

17:18.041 --> 17:19.876
Now let's roll the tape.

17:19.911 --> 17:22.813
(Dramatic music plays)

17:27.685 --> 17:30.353
Bonnie: Run, Emmy, run!

17:32.523 --> 17:36.126
Yeah.
Yeah, I couldn't get the security tapes.

17:36.160 --> 17:39.162
Turns out they have a
new manager and he's gay.

17:39.197 --> 17:40.997
Is he gay?

17:41.032 --> 17:43.967
Or is he just not attracted to the devil?

17:45.937 --> 17:49.005
- Well, look who's back.
- Oh, Ben! (Laughs)

17:49.040 --> 17:51.875
<i>Buenos dias!</i>

17:51.909 --> 17:55.779
Did Riley tell you I just got back?
Man, am I jet-lagged.

17:55.813 --> 17:59.583
So how was Paris, man?
Did you see the Mona liar?

17:59.617 --> 18:01.485
Or the lie-ffel tower?

18:01.519 --> 18:04.488
I wish, but France was closed.

18:04.522 --> 18:08.358
(Panting) He knows... everything.

18:08.392 --> 18:11.428
I can't believe you were willing to lie
to me and embarrass me on national TV,

18:11.462 --> 18:13.530
- all to protect Danny.
- Ben, I'm so sorry...

18:13.564 --> 18:17.200
Hey, hey, hey. She wanted to tell
you the truth the whole time,

18:17.235 --> 18:19.269
but I wouldn't let her.
So if you're gonna be mad at anyone,

18:19.303 --> 18:22.038
- it should be me.
- Oh, don't worry, I'm plenty mad at you.

18:22.073 --> 18:25.041
But right now,
I'd like to focus my mad on her.

18:25.076 --> 18:27.010
Why is my brother always
in the middle of us?

18:27.044 --> 18:28.845
He's not.

18:30.882 --> 18:33.817
You want the truth? Here's the truth.

18:33.851 --> 18:36.786
I got dumped.
I put my whole heart and future into a girl

18:36.821 --> 18:38.588
and she leveled me with one voicemail.

18:38.623 --> 18:40.590
Okay, yeah, that sucks,

18:40.625 --> 18:43.393
but do you think you're the
first person to ever get dumped?

18:43.427 --> 18:44.561
How does that give you
the right to lie to me,

18:44.595 --> 18:46.396
or ask my girlfriend to lie for you?

18:46.430 --> 18:48.365
I was just crushed and embarrassed,

18:48.399 --> 18:49.566
and I didn't want to face anybody.

18:49.600 --> 18:52.369
Well, guess what, Danny? I'm not anybody.

18:52.403 --> 18:54.337
I'm your brother,
and we don't lie to each other.

18:54.372 --> 18:57.073
I just always want you to
be able to look up to me.

18:57.108 --> 18:59.009
I will always look up to you...

19:01.012 --> 19:02.913
Not just because I physically have to.

19:04.882 --> 19:06.049
I don't judge you.

19:06.083 --> 19:07.751
I love you, man.

19:09.887 --> 19:12.622
- Voicemail? Seriously?
- Yeah, lame, right?

19:12.657 --> 19:13.623
So lame.

19:16.661 --> 19:18.562
So we all good?

19:18.596 --> 19:20.463
Who wants to go get drunk?
We should go get drunk.

19:20.498 --> 19:22.732
- I'm gonna go get drunk.
- Ah! (Laughs)

19:22.767 --> 19:26.469
Not... no, not so fast.

19:26.504 --> 19:29.406
You lied to me, deceived me,

19:29.440 --> 19:31.541
went behind my back and humiliated me.

19:33.311 --> 19:34.511
But I totally get why you did it.

19:36.314 --> 19:38.448
Danny's lucky to have a friend like you.

19:38.482 --> 19:41.551
Ben, I just...

19:41.586 --> 19:44.588
Wow,
I should probably stop talking and hug you.

19:44.622 --> 19:46.623
Mm, a kiss might work better.

19:55.366 --> 19:57.267
Jeez, get a room.

19:58.603 --> 20:00.270
Go home.

20:05.046 --> 20:06.079
So, if

20:06.162 --> 20:11.066
mom's rented out her place, and now
she lives in my room, where do I live?

20:11.100 --> 20:14.969
Hm. Maybe there's a beanstalk
somewhere with your name on it.

20:15.004 --> 20:16.162
- (Laughter)
- Don't worry, Danny.

20:16.262 --> 20:17.929
You can have your room back.

20:17.963 --> 20:19.898
I'll just take the couch.

20:19.932 --> 20:22.233
You guys won't even notice I'm here.

20:22.268 --> 20:24.969
All right. Oh, hey, could you toss me one

20:25.004 --> 20:26.971
of those beers? Those look good.

20:27.006 --> 20:28.973
Hey, which one of these turns on the TV?

20:29.008 --> 20:32.143
And what are you guys doing for dinner?
I'm starving.

20:32.178 --> 20:34.012
- Okay, she's gotta go.
- She's my mom.

20:34.046 --> 20:35.180
- No.
- Oh, hey, anybody should go,

20:35.214 --> 20:36.881
- it should be you.
- I live here.

20:36.916 --> 20:38.883
- Oh, I got a deal!
- I'm sorry?

20:38.918 --> 20:41.920
- You gotta carry me out!
- Okay, let's go!

20:41.954 --> 20:43.087
Let's see you do it!

20:43.122 --> 20:45.156
Oh, man, it is good to be home.

20:45.191 --> 20:46.858
All the way out the door!
All the way out the door!
