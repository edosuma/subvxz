WEBVTT

00:02.267 --> 00:04.133
ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, SMALL

00:04.133 --> 00:05.800
BUSINESSES ARE CLOSING THEIR

00:05.800 --> 00:08.400
DOORS, KILLING DREAMS AND

00:08.400 --> 00:09.733
COSTING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF

00:09.733 --> 00:10.900
JOBS.

00:10.900 --> 00:12.633
I'M HERE TO FIX THIS BUSINESS.

00:12.633 --> 00:14.367
MY NAME IS MARCUS LEMONIS.

00:14.367 --> 00:15.933
IN THE PAST TEN YEARS, I'VE

00:15.933 --> 00:17.233
BOUGHT HUNDREDS OF FAILING

00:17.233 --> 00:19.133
BUSINESSES, TURNED THEM AROUND,

00:19.133 --> 00:20.533
AND I'VE MADE MILLIONS DOING IT.

00:20.533 --> 00:21.767
I'LL WRITE WHATEVER CHECK I NEED

00:21.767 --> 00:22.967
TO, EVEN IF YOU WON'T.

00:22.967 --> 00:24.533
IF YOU WANT PEOPLE TO LISTEN,

00:24.533 --> 00:25.967
YOU PUT MONEY ON THE TABLE.

00:25.967 --> 00:27.067
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A CHECK FOR

00:27.067 --> 00:28.367
$500,000.

00:28.367 --> 00:29.967
I FOUND SIX STRUGGLING

00:29.967 --> 00:32.200
BUSINESSES, SOME WEEKS AWAY FROM

00:32.200 --> 00:33.267
CLOSURE.

00:33.267 --> 00:35.200
MY PLAN IS TO TURN THEM AROUND.

00:35.200 --> 00:37.000
FOR THE NEXT WEEK, I'M 100% IN

00:37.000 --> 00:38.267
CHARGE.

00:38.267 --> 00:39.533
ALL RIGHT.

00:39.533 --> 00:41.700
LET'S GO GET TO WORK.

00:41.700 --> 00:42.833
CAN'T RUN A BUSINESS IF IT'S NOT

00:42.833 --> 00:43.933
CLEAN.

00:43.933 --> 00:44.933
BUT I'M NOT JUST GIVING THEM

00:44.933 --> 00:45.600
ADVICE.

00:45.600 --> 00:46.600
I'M PUTTING UP MILLIONS OF

00:46.600 --> 00:48.133
DOLLARS OF MY OWN MONEY.

00:48.133 --> 00:49.067
IF YOU DON'T KNOW YOUR NUMBERS,

00:49.067 --> 00:49.867
YOU JUST DON'T KNOW YOUR

00:49.867 --> 00:50.533
BUSINESS.

00:50.533 --> 00:51.900
I'LL WORK BY THEIR SIDE...

00:51.900 --> 00:53.033
I'LL PUT IN THE HOURS...

00:53.033 --> 00:54.133
'CAUSE I HAVE THE SAME RISK

00:54.133 --> 00:55.033
THAT THEY DO.

00:55.033 --> 00:55.700
WHERE'S ACCOUNTING?

00:55.700 --> 00:56.833
SHE'S COUNTING.

00:56.833 --> 00:58.167
NO, WHERE'S ACCOUNTING?

00:58.167 --> 00:59.533
UM...

00:59.533 --> 01:00.800
OH, MY GOD.

01:00.800 --> 01:03.300
THIS BUSINESS IS A TOTAL MESS.

01:03.300 --> 01:04.700
I JUDGE BUSINESSES BASED ON

01:04.700 --> 01:05.967
THREE THINGS:

01:11.733 --> 01:13.267
IT'S PRETTY DAMN GOOD.

01:13.267 --> 01:14.600
MOST OFTEN, BUSINESSES FAIL

01:14.600 --> 01:16.400
BECAUSE OF PEOPLE.

01:16.400 --> 01:17.533
I TRUSTED PEOPLE TO MANAGE.

01:17.533 --> 01:18.833
THAT'S NOT FAIR--

01:18.833 --> 01:19.833
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

01:19.833 --> 01:20.833
DON'T YOU EVEN GO THERE.

01:20.833 --> 01:21.967
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

01:21.967 --> 01:23.533
YOU'RE STRANGLING THINGS.

01:23.533 --> 01:24.733
BACK UP.

01:24.733 --> 01:26.100
I'M THERE TO LEAD, BUT IF

01:26.100 --> 01:27.800
THEY DON'T FOLLOW, THIS BUSINESS

01:27.800 --> 01:28.800
DOESN'T MAKE IT.

01:28.800 --> 01:30.133
YOU'RE A THIEF AND A LIAR AND A

01:30.133 --> 01:30.800
CHEATER.

01:30.800 --> 01:31.500
YOU DIDN'T DO WHAT YOU

01:31.500 --> 01:32.167
PROMISED.

01:32.167 --> 01:33.200
GET OUT OF MY FACE.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.200
ALL I HEAR IS A BUNCH OF NOISE.

01:35.200 --> 01:36.100
[crying] I DON'T WANT TO LOSE

01:36.100 --> 01:36.833
MY COMPANY.

01:36.833 --> 01:38.167
I'LL MAKE THE TOUGH DECISIONS

01:38.167 --> 01:38.833
THEY WON'T.

01:38.833 --> 01:40.567
YOU'RE BEING DEMOTED.

01:40.567 --> 01:41.633
ANYTHING TO TURN THESE

01:41.633 --> 01:43.767
UNSUCCESSFUL BUSINESSES AROUND.

01:43.767 --> 01:44.867
WHAT THE [bleep] IS YOUR

01:44.867 --> 01:45.667
PROBLEM?

01:45.667 --> 01:46.567
THAT PEOPLE DON'T [bleep]

01:46.567 --> 01:47.267
WANT TO DO IT ANYMORE.

01:47.267 --> 01:48.200
ARE YOU CHALLENGING ME?

01:48.200 --> 01:49.300
YOU'RE MAKING ME LOOK LIKE A

01:49.300 --> 01:50.800
STUPID LIAR, AND I'M NOT.

01:50.800 --> 01:51.633
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO TRUST

01:51.633 --> 01:52.567
YOU?

01:52.567 --> 01:53.667
AND IF THEY CAN'T CUT IT...

01:53.667 --> 01:54.500
I GAVE YOU VERY SIMPLE

01:54.500 --> 01:55.967
INSTRUCTIONS, AND YOU FAILED.

01:55.967 --> 01:57.067
THE DEAL'S OFF.

01:57.067 --> 01:58.467
THIS IS MY [bleep] TOWN.

01:58.467 --> 01:59.367
YOU WANNA LOSE THE DEAL WITH

01:59.367 --> 02:00.233
ME?

02:00.233 --> 02:01.767
THEY NEED TO GO, TODAY.

02:01.767 --> 02:03.100
IF THEY GET WITH THE PROGRAM...

02:03.100 --> 02:03.900
GIVE ME A HUG.

02:03.900 --> 02:05.933
I'LL TEACH THEM HOW TO SUCCEED.

02:05.933 --> 02:06.767
I THINK HIM COMING IN HERE

02:06.767 --> 02:08.167
HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.

02:08.167 --> 02:09.167
I THINK IT'S A DREAM COME

02:09.167 --> 02:10.032
TRUE.

02:10.032 --> 02:11.800
I MEAN THE MORALE IS BETTER

02:11.800 --> 02:13.700
THAN IT'S BEEN IN A LONG TIME.

02:13.700 --> 02:14.400
ANY TIME YOU WANT TO SAY

02:14.400 --> 02:15.367
THANK YOU, I'LL BE FINE WITH

02:15.367 --> 02:16.467
THAT.

02:16.467 --> 02:17.633
THANK YOU.

02:17.633 --> 02:19.033
I'M RESCUING THE AMERICAN

02:19.033 --> 02:20.967
DREAM ONE BUSINESS AT A TIME.

02:20.967 --> 02:22.467
IT JUST CHANGED OUR LOOK.

02:22.467 --> 02:23.300
CONGRATULATIONS.

02:23.300 --> 02:24.133
YOU EARNED IT.

02:24.133 --> 02:25.433
IT MAY TAKE 30 YEARS, BUT YOU

02:25.433 --> 02:26.433
KNOW I'M GONNA MAKE MONEY.

02:26.433 --> 02:27.267
DID YOU ACTUALLY JUST TELL ME

02:27.267 --> 02:29.400
THAT IT'S GONNA TAKE 30 YEARS?

02:29.400 --> 02:31.133
OH, MY GOD.

02:31.133 --> 02:32.500
TONIGHT ON <i> THE PROFIT...</i>

02:32.500 --> 02:33.167
I'M MARCUS.

02:33.167 --> 02:34.367
IT'S A REAL PLEASURE--THANK

02:34.367 --> 02:35.033
YOU SO MUCH.

02:35.033 --> 02:35.767
NICE TO MEET YOU.

02:35.767 --> 02:36.867
I GO INSIDE CAR CASH, AN

02:36.867 --> 02:38.467
AUTO-BUYING BUSINESS RUN BY TWO

02:38.467 --> 02:39.833
BROTHERS IN NEW YORK CITY, WHICH

02:39.833 --> 02:41.933
IS ON THE BRINK OF FAILURE.

02:41.933 --> 02:43.067
WE'RE DANGEROUSLY LOW ON CASH

02:43.067 --> 02:44.167
RIGHT NOW, WHICH MEANS I CAN'T

02:44.167 --> 02:46.833
BUY CARS.

02:46.833 --> 02:47.667
IF I CAN'T FIX THE

02:47.667 --> 02:48.333
BUSINESS...

02:48.333 --> 02:50.067
IF YOU DON'T LIKE MONEY, DON'T

02:50.067 --> 02:51.167
FOLLOW MY PROCESS.

02:51.167 --> 02:51.833
AND THE BROTHERS'

02:51.833 --> 02:52.533
RELATIONSHIP...

02:52.533 --> 02:53.600
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

02:53.600 --> 02:55.300
THERE'S NO [bleep] WAY!

02:55.300 --> 02:56.767
CAR CASH WILL BE CLOSED FOR

02:56.767 --> 02:58.733
GOOD.

03:10.133 --> 03:12.400
35 YEARS AGO, BRUCE BARON DREAMT

03:12.400 --> 03:14.133
UP CAR CASH, A BUSINESS THAT

03:14.133 --> 03:15.600
ALLOWS YOU TO SELL A USED CAR

03:15.600 --> 03:18.100
FOR CASH WITHOUT ALL THE HASSLE.

03:18.100 --> 03:19.533
THE BUSINESS THRIVED, MAKING

03:19.533 --> 03:22.133
UPWARDS OF $50,000 A WEEK, AND

03:22.133 --> 03:23.733
BRUCE BROUGHT HIS SONS JONATHAN

03:23.733 --> 03:25.333
AND ANDREW INTO THE COMPANY.

03:25.333 --> 03:26.133
NICE TO MEET YOU.

03:26.133 --> 03:28.333
IN 2007, THE RECESSION HIT.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.633
THE BUSINESS TANKED, AND THE

03:29.633 --> 03:31.000
FAMILY STRUGGLED TO KEEP IT

03:31.000 --> 03:31.667
PROFITABLE.

03:31.667 --> 03:34.167
MY JOB IS ON THE LINE.

03:34.167 --> 03:35.567
BRUCE PASSED AWAY LAST YEAR,

03:35.567 --> 03:37.833
MAKING THE SITUATION EVEN WORSE

03:37.833 --> 03:38.933
AS THE BROTHERS MOURN THEIR

03:38.933 --> 03:40.533
FATHER, STRUGGLE WITH BUSINESS,

03:40.533 --> 03:41.567
AND EACH OTHER.

03:41.567 --> 03:43.133
I'M ABOUT TO BLOW MY TOP

03:43.133 --> 03:43.800
HERE.

03:43.800 --> 03:45.567
NEVER TELL SOMEBODY AGAIN TO DO

03:45.567 --> 03:46.233
THAT.

03:46.233 --> 03:47.100
LAST YEAR, THE COMPANY

03:47.100 --> 03:49.133
GENERATED $13 MILLION IN SALES,

03:49.133 --> 03:51.800
BUT POSTED A $200,000 LOSS.

03:51.800 --> 03:54.033
NOW SALES ARE DOWN 70% FROM

03:54.033 --> 03:55.167
THEIR PEAK, AND THE BROTHERS

03:55.167 --> 03:57.533
FIND THEMSELVES $200,000 IN

03:57.533 --> 03:59.033
DEBT AND COUNTING.

03:59.033 --> 04:00.267
THEY'VE HAD TO LAY OFF MANY

04:00.267 --> 04:01.667
EMPLOYEES, AND NEITHER OF THEM

04:01.667 --> 04:03.100
HAVE TAKEN HOME A PAYCHECK IN

04:03.100 --> 04:03.767
MONTHS.

04:03.767 --> 04:04.733
I'M IN THE HEAT OF BATTLE.

04:04.733 --> 04:06.133
I'M BUSY DOWNSTAIRS GENERATING

04:06.133 --> 04:06.967
INCOME!

04:06.967 --> 04:08.800
MOUNTING DEBT, COMBINED WITH

04:08.800 --> 04:10.300
LAGGING SALES, MEANS THAT THEY

04:10.300 --> 04:12.400
COULD BE MERE WEEKS AWAY FROM

04:12.400 --> 04:13.600
SHUTTING THE DOORS ON THIS

04:13.600 --> 04:15.067
MANHATTAN INSTITUTION.

04:15.067 --> 04:16.233
I'M SICK OF THIS BULL[bleep].

04:16.233 --> 04:17.267
I'LL DO ANYTHING TO FIX THIS

04:17.267 --> 04:18.399
BUSINESS.

04:18.399 --> 04:19.500
I'VE BEEN BUYING AND SELLING

04:19.500 --> 04:21.233
CARS SINCE I WAS A TEENAGER, AND

04:21.233 --> 04:22.867
I KNOW THIS BUSINESS.

04:22.867 --> 04:24.400
AND WITH OVER 50 MILLION NEW AND

04:24.400 --> 04:25.767
USED CARS SOLD IN THIS COUNTRY

04:25.767 --> 04:27.500
LAST YEAR, WELL, I SEE BIG

04:27.500 --> 04:29.033
OPPORTUNITY WITH THE CAR CASH

04:29.033 --> 04:31.100
BRAND, AND I WANT A PIECE OF IT.

04:31.100 --> 04:32.833
IF JONATHAN AND ANDREW FOLLOW MY

04:32.833 --> 04:34.367
LEAD, I WILL TURN THIS PLACE

04:34.367 --> 04:35.667
AROUND AND MAKE IT PROFITABLE

04:35.667 --> 04:37.900
AGAIN.

04:37.900 --> 04:39.133
GOOD, RIGHT THERE IS GOOD.

04:39.133 --> 04:39.867
THANK YOU.

05:01.967 --> 05:02.633

05:02.633 --> 05:03.367
RIGHT HERE, WE'RE IN THE

05:03.367 --> 05:04.033
BUYING OFFICE.

05:04.033 --> 05:04.700
OKAY.

05:04.700 --> 05:05.467
WHEN WE BUY THE VEHICLES, WE

05:05.467 --> 05:06.233
SIT THE CUSTOMERS HERE.

05:06.233 --> 05:07.100
THIS IS WHERE WE NEGOTIATE

05:07.100 --> 05:08.400
ALL THE DEALS.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.067
WHERE DO YOU SIT, THEN?

05:09.067 --> 05:09.733

05:09.733 --> 05:10.767

I LIKE THE MASCOT.

05:14.567 --> 05:15.233
YEAH.

05:15.233 --> 05:16.733
HE'S AWESOME.

05:16.733 --> 05:17.833
HOW MANY SQUARE FEET DO YOU HAVE

05:17.833 --> 05:18.567
IN TOTAL?

05:18.567 --> 05:20.967
UH, I THINK 4,500.

05:20.967 --> 05:22.033
WHICH IS THIS GARAGE...

05:22.033 --> 05:22.700
YEAH.

05:22.700 --> 05:23.367
AND THIS?

05:23.367 --> 05:24.033
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

05:24.033 --> 05:24.700
AND THAT'S IT.

05:24.700 --> 05:25.467
AND WE DO HAVE A SMALL OFFICE

05:25.467 --> 05:26.433
UPSTAIRS ALSO.

05:26.433 --> 05:27.467
WHAT'S THE RENT HERE A MONTH,

05:27.467 --> 05:28.600

ALMOST 30,000?

05:32.767 --> 05:33.433
YEAH.

05:33.433 --> 05:34.300
YEP.

05:34.300 --> 05:35.800
SPACE IS VERY EXPENSIVE IN

05:35.800 --> 05:36.467
MANHATTAN.

05:36.467 --> 05:37.633
HAVING A LARGE OVERHEAD, WELL,

05:37.633 --> 05:38.967
THAT PUTS A LOT OF PRESSURE ON A

05:38.967 --> 05:40.000
BUSINESS.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.800
ARE BOTH OF YOU HERE EVERY DAY?

05:41.800 --> 05:43.100
SIX DAYS A WEEK, YEAH.

05:43.100 --> 05:44.067
YOU'RE THE GENERAL MANAGER?

05:44.067 --> 05:44.733
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

05:44.733 --> 05:45.967
AND YOUR ROLE IS?

05:45.967 --> 05:47.467
MARKETING, INTERNET, SOCIAL

05:47.467 --> 05:48.133
MEDIA.

05:48.133 --> 05:49.233
WHAT'S YOUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE

05:49.233 --> 05:50.033
TODAY?

05:50.033 --> 05:51.600
GETTING CUSTOMERS TO COME IN.

05:51.600 --> 05:53.033
I ALSO NEED WORKING CAPITAL.

05:53.033 --> 05:54.133
WE'RE DANGEROUSLY LOW ON CASH

05:54.133 --> 05:55.300
RIGHT NOW, WHICH MEANS I CAN'T

05:55.300 --> 05:56.533
BUY CARS.

05:56.533 --> 05:57.267
HOW MUCH DO YOU SPEND ON

05:57.267 --> 05:58.533
ADVERTISING?

05:58.533 --> 05:59.700
UM, BETWEEN 5,000 AND 10,000

05:59.700 --> 06:01.233
A WEEK.

06:01.233 --> 06:01.900
A WEEK?

06:01.900 --> 06:02.967
AND HOW MANY PEOPLE ACTUALLY

06:02.967 --> 06:04.233
COME HERE A DAY?

06:04.233 --> 06:04.933
YOU KNOW, SOME DAYS WE GET

06:04.933 --> 06:05.633
FIVE...

06:05.633 --> 06:06.300
YEAH.

06:06.300 --> 06:07.633
MAYBE TEN A DAY.

06:07.633 --> 06:08.633
AND WHAT'S YOUR BUYING RATE?

06:08.633 --> 06:09.433
WHA--HOW MANY ARE YOU BUYING?

06:09.433 --> 06:10.233
I'M IN THE RATIO--WE'RE

06:10.233 --> 06:11.467
PROBABLY CLOSING, LIKE, 80% OF--

06:11.467 --> 06:12.700
WHAT'S TYPICAL MARGIN ON A

06:12.700 --> 06:13.567
CAR?

06:13.567 --> 06:14.900
ANYTHING UNDER 10,000, YOU

06:14.900 --> 06:16.833
HAVE TO MAKE $500 ON THE CAR.

06:16.833 --> 06:17.767
THAT'S A SLIM MARGIN.

06:17.767 --> 06:18.867
IT'S A VERY SLIM MARGIN.

06:18.867 --> 06:20.367
THE OVERHEAD AT CAR CASH IS

06:20.367 --> 06:22.867
CLOSE TO $100,000 A MONTH, AND

06:22.867 --> 06:24.300
THEY BUY ABOUT 80 CARS, WITH AN

06:24.300 --> 06:25.533
AVERAGE PROFIT OF $50,000 TO

06:25.533 --> 06:27.733
$100,000, WHICH MEANS THEY'RE

06:27.733 --> 06:30.967
LOSING MONEY EVERY SINGLE MONTH.

06:30.967 --> 06:32.367
MY FIRST IMPRESSION IS THAT THE

06:32.367 --> 06:35.233
PLACE LOOKS TIRED AND WORN DOWN.

06:35.233 --> 06:36.100
I WOULD LOVE TO, YOU KNOW,

06:36.100 --> 06:37.200
SPRUCE UP THE PLACE.

06:37.200 --> 06:39.367
THE ORANGE IS A LITTLE DATED.

06:39.367 --> 06:40.900
YOU KNOW, I WANTED BOLD, VIVID

06:40.900 --> 06:43.400
COLORS WITH WHITE.

06:43.400 --> 06:44.367
IT'S GOT TO POP.

06:44.367 --> 06:45.033
I DON'T THINK SO.

06:45.033 --> 06:45.733
I DON'T AGREE.

06:45.733 --> 06:47.167
THE ORANGE AND BLACK WORKS

06:47.167 --> 06:49.133
BECAUSE IT'S STRIKING, IT STANDS

06:49.133 --> 06:50.233
OUT, AND THE OFFICE IS VERY

06:50.233 --> 06:50.900
INVITING.

06:50.900 --> 06:52.300
WHAT OFFICE IS INVITING?

06:52.300 --> 06:53.933
THE BUYING OFFICE.

06:53.933 --> 06:55.567
NO?

06:55.567 --> 06:56.500
NO.

06:56.500 --> 06:57.500
SO, GUYS, I WANTED TO SPEND A

06:57.500 --> 06:58.167
LITTLE TIME KIND OF

06:58.167 --> 06:59.500
UNDERSTANDING THE TRAFFIC THAT

06:59.500 --> 07:00.233
COMES THROUGH HERE.

07:00.233 --> 07:02.067
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY WEST 55TH GETS

07:02.067 --> 07:03.333
A TON OF TRAFFIC.

07:03.333 --> 07:04.867
THIS IS A FANTASTIC LOCATION.

07:04.867 --> 07:06.300
WE'RE BASICALLY THE ONLY OUTLET

07:06.300 --> 07:07.567
TO THE WEST SIDE HIGHWAY, SO

07:07.567 --> 07:08.800
THERE ARE LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF

07:08.800 --> 07:10.333
CARS EVERY DAY DRIVING DOWN 55TH

07:10.333 --> 07:11.000
STREET.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.367
SO WHAT KIND OF ADVERTISING

07:12.367 --> 07:13.033
DO YOU DO?

07:13.033 --> 07:14.400
YOU DO RADIO ADVERTISING?

07:14.400 --> 07:15.333
RADIO AND WEB.

07:15.333 --> 07:16.067
SO, YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF

07:16.067 --> 07:16.733
MARKETING?

07:16.733 --> 07:18.000
FOR THE MOST PART.

07:18.000 --> 07:18.767
WHAT--WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "FOR

07:18.767 --> 07:19.933
THE MOST PART"?

07:19.933 --> 07:21.633
WELL, WITH THE RADIO, JON

07:21.633 --> 07:23.367
HANDLES THAT, AND INTERNET--

07:23.367 --> 07:25.267
ISN'T THAT MARKETING?

07:25.267 --> 07:27.667
I--THIS IS--YES.

07:27.667 --> 07:30.000
IT'S--IT'S SORT OF A DISCONNECT

07:30.000 --> 07:31.233
THAT WE--THAT JON AND I HAVE.

07:31.233 --> 07:32.767
50% OF THE BUSINESS BELONGS

07:32.767 --> 07:34.800
TO HIM, SO MY GUESS IS THAT

07:34.800 --> 07:36.000
EITHER YOU'RE NOT FIGHTING FOR

07:36.000 --> 07:36.967
IT, OR HE'S JUST NOT LISTENING

07:36.967 --> 07:37.633
TO YOU.

07:37.633 --> 07:38.667
ONE OF THE TWO IS HAPPENING.

07:38.667 --> 07:39.433
DO YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE IN

07:39.433 --> 07:40.233
ADVERTISING?

07:40.233 --> 07:40.900
YEAH, YEAH.

07:40.900 --> 07:41.700
AND WHAT KIND OF THINGS HAVE

07:41.700 --> 07:42.767
YOU PITCHED TO JON THAT HE'S

07:42.767 --> 07:44.700
JUST KYBOSHED, SAID NO TO?

07:44.700 --> 07:45.933
I WOULD HAVE A FLEET OF CARS

07:45.933 --> 07:47.000
THAT WOULD DRIVE AROUND TO DO

07:47.000 --> 07:47.733
MOBILE APPRAISALS.

07:47.733 --> 07:49.467
THAT WOULD BE WRAPPED UP IN A

07:49.467 --> 07:51.133
CAR CASH ADVERTISEMENT.

07:51.133 --> 07:51.800
IT WOULD BE BRIGHT.

07:51.800 --> 07:53.167
IT WOULD BE VIBRANT--THE COLOR.

07:53.167 --> 07:54.700
IT WOULD CATCH PEOPLE'S EYES.

07:54.700 --> 07:56.167
WE NEVER DID THAT BEFORE.

07:56.167 --> 07:57.467
IT JUST SEEMS SO SILLY.

07:57.467 --> 07:58.700
THESE ARE SOME GOOD IDEAS.

07:58.700 --> 07:59.500
WHY AREN'T YOU FIGHTING FOR

07:59.500 --> 08:00.733
THEM?

08:00.733 --> 08:02.600
YOU KNOW, TO BE CANDID,

08:02.600 --> 08:03.667
THERE'S ONLY SO MANY--SO MANY

08:03.667 --> 08:04.500
TIMES YOU GET KICKED IN THE

08:04.500 --> 08:07.067
BALLS UNTIL YOU STOP TRYING.

08:07.067 --> 08:08.367
THE BARON BROTHERS ARE WAGING

08:08.367 --> 08:10.033
THEIR OWN LITTLE WAR, AND THAT'S

08:10.033 --> 08:10.967
BAD FOR BUSINESS.

08:10.967 --> 08:13.000
ANDREW NEEDS TO FIND HIS PLACE

08:13.000 --> 08:16.067
AND STAKE HIS CLAIM.

08:16.067 --> 08:17.133
WAS THIS A FOUR-CYLINDER OR A

08:17.133 --> 08:20.133
SIX-CYLINDER?

08:20.133 --> 08:21.033
HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

08:21.033 --> 08:21.700
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

08:21.700 --> 08:22.367
I'M MARCUS.

08:22.367 --> 08:23.033
STEVEN.

08:23.033 --> 08:24.567
both: NICE TO MEET YOU.

08:24.567 --> 08:25.533
IS THIS YOUR CAR?

08:25.533 --> 08:26.767
NO, NO, WE'RE WHOLESALING

08:26.767 --> 08:27.433
THEM.

08:27.433 --> 08:28.100
WHOLESALING THEM?

08:28.100 --> 08:29.400
YOU BUY CARS FROM THEM?

08:29.400 --> 08:30.467
YES.

08:30.467 --> 08:31.867
HOW MANY DO YOU BUY A MONTH?

08:31.867 --> 08:33.000
40 TO 50.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.000
SOMETHING AROUND THAT NUMBER.

08:34.000 --> 08:34.866
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE BUYING?

08:34.866 --> 08:36.600
YEAH.

08:36.600 --> 08:37.767
WHOLESALERS ARE A BROKER WHO

08:37.767 --> 08:38.667
STAND IN THE MIDDLE OF A

08:38.667 --> 08:39.866
TRANSACTION.

08:39.866 --> 08:41.533
THEY BUY CARS FROM JON, THEY

08:41.533 --> 08:42.866
MARK UP THE PRICE, AND THEY SELL

08:42.866 --> 08:44.333
IT TO A DEALER.

08:44.333 --> 08:45.433
WHY DO WE NEED MIDDLEMEN AROUND

08:45.433 --> 08:46.100
HERE?

08:46.100 --> 08:47.067
HOW OFTEN IS HE HERE?

08:47.067 --> 08:47.733
MY FRIEND STEVEN?

08:47.733 --> 08:48.400
MM-HMM.

08:48.400 --> 08:49.067
ALL THE TIME.

08:49.067 --> 08:49.800
HE'S ACTUALLY A WHOLESALER.

08:49.800 --> 08:51.300
I SELL MOST OF MY CARS TO HIM.

08:51.300 --> 08:52.500
WHY?

08:52.500 --> 08:53.800
UM, BECAUSE I TRUST HIM VERY

08:53.800 --> 08:54.467
MUCH.

08:54.467 --> 08:55.233
HE'S A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE.

08:55.233 --> 08:56.500
BUT THE ISSUE THAT I HAVE IS

08:56.500 --> 08:57.233
THAT YOU'RE GIVING UP THE

08:57.233 --> 08:58.967
SPREAD.

08:58.967 --> 09:00.633
WHAT DID YOU PUT ON THE CAR?

09:00.633 --> 09:01.400
UH, 8,000.

09:01.400 --> 09:02.100
WHAT DID STEVEN PAY YOU FOR

09:02.100 --> 09:02.767
IT?

09:02.767 --> 09:03.433
8,500.

09:03.433 --> 09:04.100
THIS CAR WILL RETAIL FOR

09:04.100 --> 09:04.767
WHAT?

09:04.767 --> 09:05.433
I'D SAY--

09:05.433 --> 09:06.100
12,900?

09:06.100 --> 09:07.300
12--I WAS GONNA SAY, 12,999,

09:07.300 --> 09:08.133
YEAH.

09:08.133 --> 09:09.300
HOW MUCH MARGIN IS THAT, IN

09:09.300 --> 09:10.467
BETWEEN YOU AND THE FINAL

09:10.467 --> 09:11.133
CUSTOMER?

09:11.133 --> 09:12.400
8,500 TO 12,999, YEAH.

09:12.400 --> 09:13.800
IT'S ALMOST $5,000, RIGHT?

09:13.800 --> 09:14.600
$4,500?

09:14.600 --> 09:15.667
THEY'RE GONNA GO SOMEWHERE ELSE

09:15.667 --> 09:16.900
AND MAKE--BETWEEN THE TIME YOU

09:16.900 --> 09:18.367
BUY IT TO THE TIME THE FINAL

09:18.367 --> 09:19.600
CUSTOMER GETS IT--$4,000 TO

09:19.600 --> 09:21.367
$5,000 ON A CAR LIKE THAT,

09:21.367 --> 09:23.367
WHEREAS YOU ONLY MAKE 500.

09:23.367 --> 09:24.067
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.

09:24.067 --> 09:24.833
THAT'S TOO MUCH MONEY.

09:24.833 --> 09:25.733
THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

09:25.733 --> 09:26.600
MAKING MONEY AND LOSING MONEY.

09:26.600 --> 09:27.433
I DON'T THINK SO--I DON'T

09:27.433 --> 09:28.867
AGREE, BECAUSE HE PUTS VERY

09:28.867 --> 09:30.167
AGGRESSIVE NUMBERS ON CARS.

09:30.167 --> 09:31.667
HE'S IN IT TO MAKE MONEY.

09:31.667 --> 09:32.467
HE'S IN IT TO MAKE MONEY, BUT

09:32.467 --> 09:33.967
HE--HE WAS VERY CLOSE TO MY DAD

09:33.967 --> 09:34.633
ALSO.

09:34.633 --> 09:35.533
HE'S LIKE FAMILY.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.067
IF JON ELIMINATED WHOLESALERS

09:37.067 --> 09:39.200
LIKE STEVEN AND SOLD DIRECTLY TO

09:39.200 --> 09:40.500
DEALERS, I THINK THERE'S AN

09:40.500 --> 09:43.167
EXTRA $1,000 TO $2,000 A CAR.

09:43.167 --> 09:44.567
AND WHEN YOU BUY 80 CARS A

09:44.567 --> 09:46.633
MONTH, THAT'S $80,000.

09:46.633 --> 09:49.500
THAT'S $960,000 A YEAR, WITHOUT

09:49.500 --> 09:53.633
BUYING ONE MORE CAR.

09:53.633 --> 09:54.933
WHEN A CUSTOMER CAME IN, I

09:54.933 --> 09:56.500
WANTED TO STAND BACK AND WATCH

09:56.500 --> 09:57.567
JON APPRAISE THE CAR.

09:57.567 --> 09:59.767
OKAY, COME INSIDE THE OFFICE.

09:59.767 --> 10:01.100
CAR CASH'S PROFIT IS

10:01.100 --> 10:02.967
DETERMINED BY TWO FACTORS--HOW

10:02.967 --> 10:04.700
MUCH THEY BUY THE CAR FOR, AND

10:04.700 --> 10:06.033
HOW MUCH THEY SELL IT FOR.

10:06.033 --> 10:07.700
SO WALK ME THROUGH THE PROCESS.

10:07.700 --> 10:09.200
I SCAN THE CAR INTO MY

10:09.200 --> 10:09.933
SOFTWARE.

10:09.933 --> 10:10.667
RIGHT.

10:10.667 --> 10:12.033
IT BRINGS UP NUMERICAL VALUES

10:12.033 --> 10:13.100
ON THE CAR.

10:13.100 --> 10:14.467
THEN FROM THERE, I TAKE--I TAKE

10:14.467 --> 10:15.700
A LOOK AROUND THE CAR.

10:15.700 --> 10:17.233
AND THEN I HAVE TO FIGURE HOW

10:17.233 --> 10:18.700
NICE THE CAR IS, HOW CLOSE TO

10:18.700 --> 10:19.367
THE BOOK VALUE.

10:19.367 --> 10:20.733
IS IT WORTH IN EXCESS OF THE

10:20.733 --> 10:22.033
BOOK VALUE.

10:22.033 --> 10:24.000
UM, YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

10:24.000 --> 10:25.700
I CAN PROBABLY GET, LIKE, $8,500

10:25.700 --> 10:26.367
FOR IT.

10:26.367 --> 10:28.233
SO, I'LL GO UP FROM $8,000.

10:28.233 --> 10:29.333
OKAY.

10:29.333 --> 10:30.167
NOW, THE NEXT STEP IS TO

10:30.167 --> 10:31.367
ACTUALLY SPEAK WITH THE--THE

10:31.367 --> 10:32.267
CUSTOMER.

10:32.267 --> 10:33.833
JON NEEDS TO DEFINITELY MAKE

10:33.833 --> 10:35.500
MORE THAN $500 ON AVERAGE PER

10:35.500 --> 10:36.167
CAR.

10:36.167 --> 10:37.967
THE BOOK VALUE IS $8,200 ON

10:37.967 --> 10:38.800
THE CAR.

10:38.800 --> 10:39.833
I'D FEEL COMFORTABLE PAYING

10:39.833 --> 10:41.067
8,000 FOR IT.

10:41.067 --> 10:42.700
UM...

10:42.700 --> 10:43.967
RIGHT NOW, CAR CASH IS IN

10:43.967 --> 10:44.700
REAL TROUBLE.

10:44.700 --> 10:46.267
THEY'RE OUT OF MONEY, AND IF

10:46.267 --> 10:48.000
THEY DON'T CHANGE THEIR PROCESS,

10:48.000 --> 10:48.833
THIS BUSINESS ISN'T GONNA MAKE

10:48.833 --> 10:49.500
IT.

10:49.500 --> 10:50.600
YOU AND I HAVE A DIFFERENCE IN

10:50.600 --> 10:51.933
PHILOSOPHY ON APPRAISAL.

10:51.933 --> 10:53.333
I LIKE THE CUSTOMER WITH ME

10:53.333 --> 10:54.067
DURING THE APPRAISAL.

10:54.067 --> 10:55.167
I WANT THE CUSTOMER TO KNOW THAT

10:55.167 --> 10:56.600
WHAT I'M DOING IS FAIR.

10:56.600 --> 10:58.033
IF I TAKE THEM AROUND THE CAR

10:58.033 --> 10:59.600
AND I POINT OUT THE DEFECTS WITH

10:59.600 --> 11:01.000
THE CAR, OR THE IMPERFECTIONS

11:01.000 --> 11:01.700
WITH THE CAR...

11:01.700 --> 11:02.900
WHEN THESE LIGHTS TURN YELLOW,

11:02.900 --> 11:03.900
YOU CAN GET THIS REPLACED.

11:03.900 --> 11:05.600
IT COSTS 300 OR 400 BUCKS.

11:05.600 --> 11:06.633
THEN WHEN I GIVE THEM A NUMBER

11:06.633 --> 11:07.767
THAT'S LOWER THAN WHAT THEY

11:07.767 --> 11:08.767
ORIGINALLY THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA

11:08.767 --> 11:10.400
BE, THEIR EXPECTATIONS ARE

11:10.400 --> 11:11.867
PROBABLY MORE IN LINE.

11:11.867 --> 11:13.033
THEY'RE LESS SURPRISED, AND THEY

11:13.033 --> 11:14.300
FEEL LIKE YOU'RE HIDING LESS.

11:14.300 --> 11:15.600
I WOULD RATHER ASK THESE

11:15.600 --> 11:17.567
QUESTIONS WITH THEM.

11:17.567 --> 11:18.367
MAKE SENSE?

11:18.367 --> 11:19.200
I LIKE THAT.

11:19.200 --> 11:20.033
I LIKE THAT APPROACH.

11:20.033 --> 11:22.667
YOU TOO?

11:22.667 --> 11:24.400
LAST YEAR, CAR CASH GENERATED

11:24.400 --> 11:26.900
OVER $13 MILLION IN REVENUE.

11:26.900 --> 11:29.967
THAT'S $13,500 PER CAR, SINCE

11:29.967 --> 11:31.967
THEY BOUGHT 960 CARS.

11:31.967 --> 11:33.867
IF JON FOLLOWED MY PROCESS AND

11:33.867 --> 11:35.067
TOOK THE CUSTOMER THROUGH THE

11:35.067 --> 11:36.800
APPRAISAL PROCESS, HE WOULD BE

11:36.800 --> 11:39.367
ABLE TO BUY CARS FOR 5% OR 10%

11:39.367 --> 11:41.133
LOWER THAN HE'S PAYING TODAY.

11:41.133 --> 11:43.500
THAT'S ABOUT $1,000 A CAR.

11:43.500 --> 11:47.633
$960,000 A YEAR, WITHOUT BUYING

11:47.633 --> 11:48.533
ONE MORE CAR.

11:48.533 --> 11:49.767
WHEN YOU LEAVE SOMEBODY IN THE

11:49.767 --> 11:52.433
OFFICE, THE LEVEL OF ANXIETY

11:52.433 --> 11:54.133
THAT'S HAPPENING, AS YOU SIT

11:54.133 --> 11:56.833
THERE, AS THE MINUTES TICK--OH,

11:56.833 --> 11:58.133
GOD.

11:58.133 --> 11:59.000
THEN YOU COME BACK WITH THE

11:59.000 --> 11:59.667
NUMBER?

11:59.667 --> 12:01.300
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU SET ME UP.

12:01.300 --> 12:03.800
I DON'T AGREE.

12:03.800 --> 12:04.800
LOOK, JON AND ANDREW ARE

12:04.800 --> 12:06.733
GREAT GUYS, AND THIS IS A GREAT

12:06.733 --> 12:09.100
CONCEPT, BUT THEY'RE HURTING.

12:09.100 --> 12:10.400
AND I KNOW THAT IF I MAKE THE

12:10.400 --> 12:11.600
CHANGES THAT I WANT TO MAKE,

12:11.600 --> 12:12.800
THIS BUSINESS WILL BE

12:12.800 --> 12:14.100
PROFITABLE, BUT THEY HAVE TO

12:14.100 --> 12:14.767
LISTEN.

12:14.767 --> 12:16.167
TH--THIS IS VERY SIMPLE FOR ME.

12:16.167 --> 12:18.100
I CAME HERE TO MAKE MONEY, AND I

12:18.100 --> 12:19.267
LIKE THE CONCEPT, BUT THE

12:19.267 --> 12:20.467
CONCEPT HAS TO GROW.

12:20.467 --> 12:21.833
FOR ME, THIS IS ABOUT OPENING

12:21.833 --> 12:23.067
MORE LOCATIONS AND SIGNING UP

12:23.067 --> 12:24.967
LICENSEES AROUND THE COUNTRY.

12:24.967 --> 12:26.400
ENTREPRENEURS COULD COME HERE

12:26.400 --> 12:28.933
AND SEE A PROTOTYPE, AND THEN IN

12:28.933 --> 12:31.800
PERPETUITY, FOREVER, ANY

12:31.800 --> 12:32.967
LICENSING DEAL THAT WE DO, YOU

12:32.967 --> 12:35.833
GUYS WILL SHARE IN A PERCENTAGE

12:35.833 --> 12:37.300
OF THOSE PROFITS WITHOUT HAVING

12:37.300 --> 12:38.633
TO PUT UP A DIME OR DO A DAY'S

12:38.633 --> 12:39.867
WORTH OF WORK.

12:39.867 --> 12:41.200
DOES THAT SOUND OKAY?

12:41.200 --> 12:42.800
IT SOUND--IT SOUNDS GREAT.

12:42.800 --> 12:43.533
YES.

12:43.533 --> 12:44.700
I'M--I'M, LIKE, BLOWN AWAY.

12:44.700 --> 12:45.733
I'M...

12:45.733 --> 12:46.767
WITH THIS PLAN, MY

12:46.767 --> 12:48.167
EXPECTATIONS ARE REALLY SIMPLE.

12:48.167 --> 12:49.933
I LOOK AT ONE LOCATION.

12:49.933 --> 12:51.633
IF I CAN BUY AN AVERAGE OF 50

12:51.633 --> 12:53.133
CARS PER LOCATION, AND JUST

12:53.133 --> 12:55.467
AVERAGE $1,000 PER CAR, I CAN

12:55.467 --> 12:58.267
GENERATE $50,000 A MONTH.

12:58.267 --> 12:59.900
AFTER I PAY MY EXPENSES, I

12:59.900 --> 13:01.767
EXPECT TO CLEAR, AFTER ALL THE

13:01.767 --> 13:04.533
BILLS, 20,000 TO 25,000 A MONTH

13:04.533 --> 13:06.233
JUST WITH ONE LOCATION.

13:06.233 --> 13:07.400
YOU DO THE MATH, IF YOU OPEN

13:07.400 --> 13:08.167
100.

13:08.167 --> 13:09.900
SO THE CATCH TO THIS WHOLE

13:09.900 --> 13:12.700
DEAL, UH, IS THAT I HAVE TO BE

13:12.700 --> 13:15.367
CONVINCED THAT THE PROTOTYPE

13:15.367 --> 13:16.067
WORKS.

13:16.067 --> 13:17.800
LIKE ANDREW MENTIONED EARLIER,

13:17.800 --> 13:19.333
THE PLACE NEEDS TO BE JAZZED UP.

13:19.333 --> 13:21.100
IT'S A LITTLE CRUSTY AND RUSTY.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.400
WOULD YOU AGREE WITH THAT?

13:23.400 --> 13:24.367
THE OTHER THING THAT NEEDS TO

13:24.367 --> 13:25.667
CHANGE IS THE RELATIONSHIP

13:25.667 --> 13:26.933
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU.

13:26.933 --> 13:28.233
DO YOU FEEL UNDERAPPRECIATED

13:28.233 --> 13:29.967
HERE?

13:29.967 --> 13:32.167
SOMETIMES.

13:32.167 --> 13:33.067
'CAUSE THERE'S TIMES WHERE WE

13:33.067 --> 13:33.967
DON'T TALK, WE DON'T

13:33.967 --> 13:35.567
COMMUNICATE.

13:35.567 --> 13:36.333
WHY IS THAT?

13:36.333 --> 13:37.233
[sighs]

13:37.233 --> 13:39.233
YOU KNOW, I HAVE A LOT OF IDEAS.

13:39.233 --> 13:40.233
I'M FULL OF IDEAS.

13:40.233 --> 13:41.567
MM.

13:41.567 --> 13:42.733
AND GOOD ONES, TOO.

13:42.733 --> 13:45.200
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO DISCUSS

13:45.200 --> 13:47.667
THINGS FOR 45 MINUTES TO AN

13:47.667 --> 13:48.433
HOUR.

13:48.433 --> 13:49.133
IT'S JUST, I'M WIRED

13:49.133 --> 13:49.800
DIFFERENTLY.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.133
LIKE, I CAN'T SIT AND TALK ABOUT

13:51.133 --> 13:53.300
STUFF LIKE THAT.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.633
IF YOU GUYS CAN'T COMMUNICATE

13:54.633 --> 13:56.267
AS BUSINESS PARTNERS, YOU CAN'T

13:56.267 --> 13:57.533
BE IN BUSINESS TOGETHER.

13:57.533 --> 13:58.833
IF YOU CAN'T TELL HIM WHAT'S

13:58.833 --> 14:00.767
WRONG, THEN YOU SHOULDN'T BE IN

14:00.767 --> 14:02.467
BUSINESS TOGETHER.

14:02.467 --> 14:04.200
[sighs]

14:04.200 --> 14:05.733
HE AND I REALLY DON'T, YOU KNOW,

14:05.733 --> 14:08.200
HANG OUT, AND...

14:13.400 --> 14:19.933
[sniffles]

14:19.933 --> 14:22.000
[sighs]

14:22.000 --> 14:25.833
I JUST WANT US TO CLICK.

14:25.833 --> 14:30.667
RIGHT NOW, IT'S NOT CLICKING.

14:30.667 --> 14:31.333
COMING UP...

14:31.333 --> 14:32.733
THE CATCH TO THIS DEAL IS THAT

14:32.733 --> 14:34.367
I'M IN CHARGE FOR THE NEXT WEEK,

14:34.367 --> 14:35.267
WHICH MEANS YOU'RE NOT IN

14:35.267 --> 14:36.400
CONTROL.

14:36.400 --> 14:37.067
AND LATER...

14:37.067 --> 14:37.900
THE FURNITURE THAT WE HAVE

14:37.900 --> 14:39.900
NOW, IT DOES NOT MATCH THE--THE

14:39.900 --> 14:40.567
DECOR OF--

14:40.567 --> 14:42.533
[bleep] YOUR DECOR, MAN!

14:47.400 --> 14:48.700
I JUST WANT US TO CLICK.

14:48.700 --> 14:50.000
RIGHT NOW, IT'S NOT CLICKING.

14:50.000 --> 14:50.900
YEAH, WE'RE NOT CLICKING

14:50.900 --> 14:52.667
BECAUSE WHEN I COME IN HERE, I'M

14:52.667 --> 14:54.100
JUST FOC--SO FOCUSED ON TRYING

14:54.100 --> 14:55.500
TO MAKE MONEY.

14:55.500 --> 14:56.167
ANDREW, WHAT ARE YOU

14:56.167 --> 14:56.833
THINKING?

14:56.833 --> 14:57.667
I'LL DO ANYTHING TO FIX THIS

14:57.667 --> 14:58.333
BUSINESS.

14:58.333 --> 15:00.900
I'M 100% COMMITTED TO CHANGE.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.033
IS YOUR BROTHER COMMITTED TO

15:02.033 --> 15:02.800
THAT?

15:02.800 --> 15:03.633
I CAN'T ANSWER THAT.

15:03.633 --> 15:06.033
ONLY HE CAN.

15:06.033 --> 15:07.500
JON DOESN'T SEEM WILLING TO

15:07.500 --> 15:08.233
CHANGE.

15:08.233 --> 15:09.433
BUT WHAT HE DOESN'T REALIZE IS

15:09.433 --> 15:11.133
THAT IF HE DOESN'T CHANGE, HIS

15:11.133 --> 15:12.667
BUSINESS IS GOING TO FAIL.

15:12.667 --> 15:14.933
SO THE DEAL THAT I HAVE, UH,

15:14.933 --> 15:17.200
HAS ME WRITING YOU A CHECK.

15:17.200 --> 15:18.300
SO I'M WILLING TO GIVE YOU GUYS

15:18.300 --> 15:20.667
$200,000.

15:20.667 --> 15:22.600
IT ALLOWS YOU TO SOLVE THE DEBT

15:22.600 --> 15:23.900
THAT YOU HAVE.

15:23.900 --> 15:25.367
IT ALLOWS YOU TO PUT SOME CASH

15:25.367 --> 15:26.500
IN THE BUSINESS AND BRING THINGS

15:26.500 --> 15:27.333
CURRENT.

15:27.333 --> 15:29.300
AND IT ALLOWS YOU A CHANCE, IN

15:29.300 --> 15:31.433
ADDITION TO THAT, TO COLLECT AN

15:31.433 --> 15:34.067
ANNUITY ON THE BRAND NAME AND

15:34.067 --> 15:35.967
THE WEBSITE FOREVER.

15:35.967 --> 15:37.733
$200,000 UP FRONT AND A

15:37.733 --> 15:39.033
LICENSING PARTNERSHIP GOING

15:39.033 --> 15:40.333
FORWARD IS A GREAT DEAL FOR

15:40.333 --> 15:41.133
THEM.

15:41.133 --> 15:41.900
I MEAN, THEY'RE REALLY GONNA

15:41.900 --> 15:42.567
BENEFIT.

15:42.567 --> 15:43.667
I'M GONNA SIGN UP LICENSEES

15:43.667 --> 15:45.133
AROUND THE COUNTRY, AND THEY'RE

15:45.133 --> 15:46.333
GONNA GET MAILBOX MONEY, WHICH

15:46.333 --> 15:47.800
MEANS EVERY TIME A NEW CAR CASH

15:47.800 --> 15:48.967
OPENS, WE'LL ALL GET A CHECK

15:48.967 --> 15:50.267
WITHOUT HAVING TO PUT UP ANY

15:50.267 --> 15:51.733
MONEY OR DO ANY WORK.

15:51.733 --> 15:53.400
SO THE CATCH TO THIS WHOLE

15:53.400 --> 15:55.867
DEAL, UH--I WANT TO BE VERY

15:55.867 --> 15:57.567
CLEAR--I'M IN CHARGE FOR THE

15:57.567 --> 15:59.667
NEXT WEEK, SO WHAT I SAY, GOES.

15:59.667 --> 16:00.633
WHICH MEANS YOU'RE NOT IN

16:00.633 --> 16:04.133
CONTROL.

16:04.133 --> 16:06.733
AT ALL.

16:06.733 --> 16:07.700
I DON'T KNOW IF GIVING

16:07.700 --> 16:09.367
CONTROL--YOU KNOW, 100% CONTROL,

16:09.367 --> 16:11.100
BASICALLY--TO SOMEBODY THAT, YOU

16:11.100 --> 16:13.733
KNOW, WE JUST MET AND, UM--

16:13.733 --> 16:15.200
[sighs] HOW DO I PUT IT?

16:15.200 --> 16:15.867
I'M A CONTROL FREAK.

16:15.867 --> 16:17.467
IT'S HARD TO LET GO OF THAT.

16:17.467 --> 16:18.533
THE BUSINESS NEEDS CASH

16:18.533 --> 16:19.567
LIKE...

16:19.567 --> 16:21.533
both: LIKE YESTERDAY.

16:21.533 --> 16:23.100
OBVIOUSLY, IT'S GONNA TAKE

16:23.100 --> 16:25.200
CAPITAL TO CHANGE THE COMPLEXION

16:25.200 --> 16:26.633
OF THE BUSINESS.

16:26.633 --> 16:28.700
BUT WE ALSO NEED CAPITAL TO BUY

16:28.700 --> 16:29.800
CARS.

16:29.800 --> 16:31.700
I DON'T KNOW IF $200,000 IS

16:31.700 --> 16:33.567
GOING TO BE ENOUGH, SO I WOULD

16:33.567 --> 16:34.833
ALSO LIKE TO ASK FOR A LINE OF

16:34.833 --> 16:35.933
CREDIT.

16:35.933 --> 16:36.700
SO HOW MUCH IS THE LINE OF

16:36.700 --> 16:37.733
CREDIT YOU WANT?

16:37.733 --> 16:39.467
OKAY, UH, LET'S SAY, CAN WE

16:39.467 --> 16:40.967
START WITH 300,000?

16:40.967 --> 16:42.600
WHAT'S THE INTEREST RATE

16:42.600 --> 16:43.967
YOU'RE GONNA PAY ME?

16:43.967 --> 16:46.500
UM, IS 5% FAIR?

16:46.500 --> 16:48.633
NO.

16:48.633 --> 16:49.967
OH. REALLY?

16:49.967 --> 16:51.100
REALLY.

16:51.100 --> 16:51.967
IT'S 10%.

16:51.967 --> 16:53.033
I NEED 10%, BECAUSE IT'S

16:53.033 --> 16:54.667
UNSECURED.

16:54.667 --> 16:55.633
WELL, IT'S UNSECURED, BUT YOU

16:55.633 --> 16:57.433
HAVE TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING.

16:57.433 --> 16:58.533
WE'RE GIVING YOU AN OPPORTUNITY

16:58.533 --> 17:00.367
TO MAKE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF

17:00.367 --> 17:01.033
DOLLARS.

17:01.033 --> 17:01.833
BUT I'M--BUT I AM PUTTING UP

17:01.833 --> 17:02.500
ALL THE MONEY.

17:02.500 --> 17:03.267
YOU'RE PUTTING UP ALL THE

17:03.267 --> 17:04.099
MONEY, BUT YOU'RE PUTTING UP THE

17:04.099 --> 17:05.433
MONEY BASED ON THE IDEA THAT OUR

17:05.433 --> 17:06.333
DAD CREATED.

17:06.333 --> 17:08.633
AND IT'S HIS VISION, AND HIS

17:08.633 --> 17:10.233
BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS THAT GOT

17:10.233 --> 17:11.933
US TO THIS POINT AND BUILT THE

17:11.933 --> 17:13.233
NAME BRAND THAT YOU'RE GONNA

17:13.233 --> 17:14.867
MAKE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.333
FOR THE SAKE OF BOTH OF US, WE

17:16.333 --> 17:17.400
NEED TO DO GOOD BUSINESS HERE.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.567
WE NEED TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY

17:18.567 --> 17:19.267
HERE.

17:19.267 --> 17:20.233
WE'RE YOUR FLAGSHIP.

17:20.233 --> 17:21.532
YOU NEED US--YOU NEED US TO BE

17:21.532 --> 17:22.833
THE MOST SUCCESSFUL FRANCHISE

17:22.833 --> 17:23.733
THAT YOU HAVE.

17:23.733 --> 17:24.400
IF WE'RE NOT YOUR MOST

17:24.400 --> 17:25.800
SUCCESSFUL ONE, THEN NOBODY IS

17:25.800 --> 17:27.032
GONNA BUY IN.

17:27.032 --> 17:28.032
ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKE

17:28.032 --> 17:29.200
ABOUT JON IS THAT HE'S WILLING

17:29.200 --> 17:29.867
TO PUSH BACK.

17:29.867 --> 17:32.233
RIGHT AFTER I GIVE HIM $200,000,

17:32.233 --> 17:33.600
HE THEN COMES BACK AND ASKS FOR

17:33.600 --> 17:35.767
ANOTHER $300,000 FOR WORKING

17:35.767 --> 17:37.333
CAPITAL.

17:37.333 --> 17:38.833
I MEAN, I THOUGHT IT WAS BOLD,

17:38.833 --> 17:40.200
BUT I LIKE THAT ABOUT HIM.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.433
IT SHOWS ME HE HAS SOME FIRE IN

17:41.433 --> 17:42.100
HIS BELLY.

17:42.100 --> 17:43.267
I'LL SPLIT THE BABY WITH YOU AT

17:43.267 --> 17:46.167
8%.

17:46.167 --> 17:46.967
HOW ABOUT 7.5%?

17:46.967 --> 17:48.000
OKAY, WE GOT A DEAL.

17:48.000 --> 17:48.667
YEP.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.100
SO WHEN YOU TAKE MY CHECK,

17:50.100 --> 17:52.300
FOR THE NEXT WEEK, I'M 100% IN

17:52.300 --> 17:53.433
CHARGE.

17:53.433 --> 17:55.867
WHICH MEANS, WHAT I SAY, GOES.

17:55.867 --> 17:56.900
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

17:56.900 --> 17:57.567
YEP.

17:57.567 --> 17:58.300
YOU BETTER BUCKLE UP...

17:58.300 --> 17:58.967
YEAH.

17:58.967 --> 18:00.700
BECAUSE CHANGE IS COMING.

18:00.700 --> 18:01.867
ONCE I MAKE A DEAL, I DON'T

18:01.867 --> 18:02.967
WASTE ANY TIME.

18:02.967 --> 18:04.367
I'M GONNA TURN THIS PLACE UPSIDE

18:04.367 --> 18:05.100
DOWN.

18:05.100 --> 18:06.667
DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

18:06.667 --> 18:07.400
ALL RIGHT.

18:07.400 --> 18:08.167
DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

18:08.167 --> 18:08.833
SOUNDS GOOD.

18:08.833 --> 18:09.500
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

18:09.500 --> 18:10.767
LET'S GET TO WORK, RIGHT

18:10.767 --> 18:13.733
AWAY, OKAY?

18:19.367 --> 18:20.033
HEY, EVERYBODY!

18:20.033 --> 18:21.133
I WANTED TO TELL YOU WHAT HAS

18:21.133 --> 18:21.800
HAPPENED.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.400
VERY EXCITING NEWS.

18:23.400 --> 18:25.033
JON AND ANDREW AND I HAVE CUT A

18:25.033 --> 18:26.800
DEAL WHERE I'M NOW GOING TO BE

18:26.800 --> 18:28.600
PART OF CAR CASH.

18:28.600 --> 18:29.867
I'M A BIG BELIEVER IN THREE

18:29.867 --> 18:32.867
THINGS--PEOPLE, PROCESS, AND

18:32.867 --> 18:34.067
PRODUCT.

18:34.067 --> 18:35.167
I THINK WE HAVE THE RIGHT

18:35.167 --> 18:37.133
PEOPLE, BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SOME

18:37.133 --> 18:38.167
IMPROVEMENTS.

18:38.167 --> 18:39.933
LOOK, I DIDN'T COME HERE TODAY

18:39.933 --> 18:42.167
TO DO ONE SINGLE BUSINESS DEAL

18:42.167 --> 18:44.200
ON WEST 55TH STREET.

18:44.200 --> 18:45.500
I CAME HERE BECAUSE I THINK

18:45.500 --> 18:47.633
1-800-CARCASH SHOULD BE A

18:47.633 --> 18:49.000
NATIONAL BRAND.

18:49.000 --> 18:51.000
WE'RE GONNA ADD LICENSEES AROUND

18:51.000 --> 18:52.933
THE COUNTRY WHO ARE GOING TO PAY

18:52.933 --> 18:54.933
US A FEE TO LICENSE

18:54.933 --> 18:57.933
1-800-CARCASH IN AN AREA THAT'S

18:57.933 --> 18:59.000
RELEVANT TO THEM.

18:59.000 --> 19:00.467
IN ORDER FOR THIS BUSINESS MODEL

19:00.467 --> 19:01.567
TO ATTRACT LICENSEES, WE'RE

19:01.567 --> 19:02.333
GONNA HAVE TO SHOW THEM IT'S

19:02.333 --> 19:03.000
PROFITABLE.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.033
THEY'RE NOT JUST GONNA BUY OFF

19:04.033 --> 19:05.100
ON AN IDEA.

19:05.100 --> 19:06.133
SO ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS WE

19:06.133 --> 19:08.333
NEED TO DO IS MAKE MORE MONEY.

19:08.333 --> 19:09.633
WE NEED TO FIX THE APPRAISAL

19:09.633 --> 19:11.100
PROCESS BY BRINGING THE CUSTOMER

19:11.100 --> 19:12.500
INTO IT SO WE CAN BUY OUR CARS

19:12.500 --> 19:13.300
FOR LESS.

19:13.300 --> 19:16.533
JON, THE WHOLESALERS HAVE TO GO.

19:16.533 --> 19:17.633
MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE NEED TO GET

19:17.633 --> 19:19.000
RID OF THESE WHOLESALERS,

19:19.000 --> 19:19.800
BECAUSE WE NEED TO MAKE THAT

19:19.800 --> 19:21.033
EXTRA MONEY THAT THEY'RE MAKING

19:21.033 --> 19:22.667
BETWEEN HERE AND THERE.

19:22.667 --> 19:24.567
THAT EXTRA MONEY COULD BE $1,000

19:24.567 --> 19:25.367
A CAR.

19:25.367 --> 19:26.667
IF WE CAN FIX THIS BUSINESS,

19:26.667 --> 19:27.867
THEN LICENSEES ARE GONNA LOVE

19:27.867 --> 19:29.167
IT, AND THEY'LL SIGN UP LIKE

19:29.167 --> 19:30.433
IT'S GOING OUT OF STYLE.

19:30.433 --> 19:31.833
IF WE'RE GOING TO BE A NATIONAL

19:31.833 --> 19:34.133
BRAND, WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO

19:34.133 --> 19:36.267
LOOK LIKE A NATIONAL BRAND.

19:36.267 --> 19:37.800
AS PART OF BUILDING A PROTOTYPE,

19:37.800 --> 19:39.600
I NEED TO DO AN ENTIRE OVERHAUL

19:39.600 --> 19:41.067
OF THE BUILDING, BUT NOT JUST

19:41.067 --> 19:41.933
THE BUILDING.

19:41.933 --> 19:43.167
WE ALSO HAVE TO CHANGE THE

19:43.167 --> 19:44.100
APPEARANCE, BECAUSE APPEARANCE

19:44.100 --> 19:45.333
IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

19:45.333 --> 19:46.567
THINGS IN BUSINESS.

19:46.567 --> 19:47.800
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

19:47.800 --> 19:49.833
LOOK AS GOOD AS WE SOUND.

19:49.833 --> 19:50.867
LET'S GO TO WORK. [claps]

19:50.867 --> 19:51.767
ALL RIGHT?

19:51.767 --> 19:56.267
LET'S GO.

19:56.267 --> 19:57.367
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I WANTED

19:57.367 --> 19:58.933
TO DO BEFORE MY TEAM SHOWS UP

19:58.933 --> 20:00.633
TOMORROW AND STARTS GUTTING THIS

20:00.633 --> 20:01.667
PLACE IS I WANTED TO GET SOME

20:01.667 --> 20:03.000
IDEAS FOR WHAT YOU'D LIKE TO SEE

20:03.000 --> 20:03.667
HAPPEN.

20:03.667 --> 20:04.900
IF WE COULD FRESHEN UP THE--

20:04.900 --> 20:06.333
MAYBE GET A NEW AWNING, I WOULD

20:06.333 --> 20:07.633
MAKE EVERYTHING CONSISTENT.

20:07.633 --> 20:09.900
I WOULD LOVE TO REDO THE FLOOR.

20:09.900 --> 20:10.900
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THIS, LIKE,

20:10.900 --> 20:12.667
IT'S SORT OF AN EPOXY PAINT.

20:12.667 --> 20:13.733
I WOULD LOVE TO DO THE ENTIRE

20:13.733 --> 20:15.500
GARAGE IN EPOXY PAINTS.

20:15.500 --> 20:16.533
SO THAT WAY IT'S EASY TO CLEAN--

20:16.533 --> 20:18.033
THAT'S A TERRIBLE IDEA.

20:18.033 --> 20:19.333
THE SOUND OF IT WHEN YOU WALK ON

20:19.333 --> 20:20.433
IT, IT'S GONNA SOUND LIKE

20:20.433 --> 20:21.533
CORDUROY PANTS SWISHING

20:21.533 --> 20:22.233
TOGETHER.

20:22.233 --> 20:23.567
ABSOLUTELY NOT, MAN.

20:23.567 --> 20:25.667
SOMETIMES MY BROTHER WILL

20:25.667 --> 20:26.733
JUST, LIKE, TUNE OUT WHAT I'M

20:26.733 --> 20:29.433
SAYING, AND IT'S EXTREMELY

20:29.433 --> 20:31.033
HURTFUL TO ME BECAUSE I HAVE

20:31.033 --> 20:31.767
VALID IDEAS.

20:31.767 --> 20:32.767
THESE ARE--THESE ARE IDEAS THAT

20:32.767 --> 20:34.367
WOULD SAVE THE [bleep] BUSINESS!

20:34.367 --> 20:36.433
SO THIS IS OUR LOVELY BATHROOM.

20:36.433 --> 20:38.133
THERE'S A LEAK IN THE PIPE HERE,

20:38.133 --> 20:40.433
UH, THE SEAT IS LOOSE.

20:40.433 --> 20:41.500
I DON'T LIKE BEING IN HERE.

20:41.500 --> 20:42.300
[laughs]

20:42.300 --> 20:42.967
HOW DO YOU THINK THE

20:42.967 --> 20:43.633
CUSTOMERS FEEL?

20:43.633 --> 20:45.100
I WOULD NOT FEEL VERY

20:45.100 --> 20:46.467
COMFORTABLE IF I WAS A CUSTOMER.

20:46.467 --> 20:47.300
I JUST DON'T WANT TO GET INTO

20:47.300 --> 20:48.033
ARGUMENTS WITH MY BROTHER

20:48.033 --> 20:48.867
ANYMORE.

20:48.867 --> 20:49.800
HE DOESN'T WANT TO SPEND THE

20:49.800 --> 20:52.133
MONEY TO DO ANYTHING INTERNALLY

20:52.133 --> 20:53.000
BECAUSE HE'S SO FOCUSED--

20:53.000 --> 20:54.200
I UNDERSTAND HE'S FOCUSED ON

20:54.200 --> 20:54.933
THAT THING.

20:54.933 --> 20:56.067
THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS I WANT

20:56.067 --> 20:57.300
TO FOCUS ON.

20:57.300 --> 20:58.500
ANDREW IS AN EQUAL OWNER IN

20:58.500 --> 20:59.667
THIS BUSINESS, AND IT'S TIME HE

20:59.667 --> 21:01.033
STOOD UP TO HIS BROTHER.

21:01.033 --> 21:02.300
HE SHOULD BE FREE TO DO HIS JOB,

21:02.300 --> 21:04.033
AND HE NEEDS TO DEMAND IT.

21:04.033 --> 21:04.933
JON, DO YOU EVER LISTEN TO

21:04.933 --> 21:06.233
ANY OF HIS IDEAS?

21:06.233 --> 21:07.533
I LISTEN TO SOME OF THEM.

21:07.533 --> 21:09.200
BUT HE'S YOUR BROTHER, WHO

21:09.200 --> 21:10.333
OWNS HALF THE BUSINESS.

21:10.333 --> 21:11.200
HE'S MY BROTHER, AND I LOVE

21:11.200 --> 21:12.633
HIM, BUT I CA--I DON'T HAVE TIME

21:12.633 --> 21:13.500
TO LISTEN TO A LOT OF THESE

21:13.500 --> 21:14.167
IDEAS.

21:14.167 --> 21:15.067
I'D LIKE TO HEAR SOME OF HIS

21:15.067 --> 21:15.733
IDEAS.

21:15.733 --> 21:16.500
I MEAN, LET'S HEAR WHAT HE HAS

21:16.500 --> 21:17.167
TO SAY.

21:17.167 --> 21:18.600
I WANT TO START ADVERTISING

21:18.600 --> 21:20.733
WITH ZIPCAR, AND--AND DOING SOME

21:20.733 --> 21:21.933
CROSS-PROMOTIONAL ADVERTISING

21:21.933 --> 21:22.600
WITH THEM.

21:22.600 --> 21:23.433
WHAT'S THE--WHAT'S THE

21:23.433 --> 21:24.233
NEXT IDEA?

21:24.233 --> 21:25.733
NO, THAT'S A VALID IDEA.

21:25.733 --> 21:26.467
THAT'S A GREAT FEATURE TO

21:26.467 --> 21:28.033
HAVE AFTER THE SALE, BUT DOESN'T

21:28.033 --> 21:29.967
GENERATE PEOPLE COMING IN HERE.

21:29.967 --> 21:30.900
THERE'S MARKETING, THERE'S

21:30.900 --> 21:32.600
ADVERTISING, AND PART OF

21:32.600 --> 21:34.233
ADVERTISING IS THE RADIO.

21:34.233 --> 21:35.933
IT'S--HONESTLY, DREW, IT'S

21:35.933 --> 21:38.033
LIKE--THIS IS LIKE A BROKEN

21:38.033 --> 21:38.833
RECORD TO ME.

21:38.833 --> 21:39.600
I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH

21:39.600 --> 21:41.000
IT, I'M SORRY.

21:41.000 --> 21:41.933
ANDREW IS SUPPOSED TO BE IN

21:41.933 --> 21:42.900
CHARGE OF MARKETING AND

21:42.900 --> 21:44.567
ADVERTISING, AND CAR CASH SPENDS

21:44.567 --> 21:46.700
BETWEEN $20,000 AND $50,000 A

21:46.700 --> 21:47.500
MONTH.

21:47.500 --> 21:49.367
MOST OF THAT IS SPENT ON RADIO.

21:49.367 --> 21:50.733
NOW, JON WON'T LET HIM CONTROL

21:50.733 --> 21:51.933
THE RADIO, SO REALLY, IN THE

21:51.933 --> 21:53.367
END, ANDREW IS IN CHARGE OF

21:53.367 --> 21:54.033
NOTHING.

21:54.033 --> 21:55.667
I WANT TO HEAR YOU TELL HIM WHY

21:55.667 --> 21:57.033
RADIO IS THE RIGHT THING FOR

21:57.033 --> 21:57.700
YOU.

21:57.700 --> 21:59.600
BOOM! HIT THE SPOT.

21:59.600 --> 22:00.733
RADIO IS REALLY, REALLY

22:00.733 --> 22:01.400
IMPORTANT.

22:01.400 --> 22:02.400
IT'S A WAY FOR US TO CONNECT

22:02.400 --> 22:03.800
WITH OUR--WITH OUR CUSTOMERS.

22:03.800 --> 22:04.767
WE NEED TO LEARN HOW TO

22:04.767 --> 22:05.700
COMMUNICATE WITH THEM.

22:05.700 --> 22:07.000
OKAY, I DID ALL THAT, THOUGH,

22:07.000 --> 22:08.500
AND I GOT US KILLER DEALS DOING

22:08.500 --> 22:09.167
THAT.

22:09.167 --> 22:09.833
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO

22:09.833 --> 22:10.500
DIFFERENTLY?

22:10.500 --> 22:11.200
I--THE CREATIVE.

22:11.200 --> 22:12.933
OKAY, BASICALLY YOU WANT TO

22:12.933 --> 22:14.500
REST--THE SINGLE BIGGEST

22:14.500 --> 22:17.300
CASH-BRINGING OPTION THAT WE

22:17.300 --> 22:19.000
HAVE, YOU WANT ME TO REST THAT

22:19.000 --> 22:19.900
IN YOUR HANDS.

22:19.900 --> 22:21.333
YOU WANT TO WRITE THE COPY.

22:21.333 --> 22:22.367
YOU WANT TO HANDLE THE MEDIA

22:22.367 --> 22:23.400
BUYING, WHEN YOU'VE NEVER DONE

22:23.400 --> 22:24.067
IT BEFORE?

22:24.067 --> 22:24.733
YEP.

22:24.733 --> 22:25.733
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

22:25.733 --> 22:27.033
THAT'S A [bleep] WASTE OF TIME.

22:27.033 --> 22:27.933
LOOK, JON, I DON'T LIKE THE

22:27.933 --> 22:29.267
WAY YOU TALK TO YOUR BROTHER.

22:29.267 --> 22:31.067
YOU--YOU PROBABLY ARE ONE OF THE

22:31.067 --> 22:33.000
BETTER CAR GUYS I'VE EVER SEEN,

22:33.000 --> 22:34.300
BUT YOU ARE ONE OF THE WORST

22:34.300 --> 22:35.667
MANAGERS OF PEOPLE THAT I'VE

22:35.667 --> 22:36.967
EVER SEEN.

22:36.967 --> 22:38.167
MAYBE THERE'S EXCUSES AND

22:38.167 --> 22:39.267
THERE'S REASONS AND THERE'S ALL

22:39.267 --> 22:40.967
THESE OTHER THINGS, BUT I THINK

22:40.967 --> 22:41.833
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HAVE TO

22:41.833 --> 22:43.500
GET CONVINCED OF IS THAT YOU CAN

22:43.500 --> 22:45.133
ACTUALLY MANAGE PEOPLE.

22:45.133 --> 22:51.133
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU DOWN.

22:51.133 --> 22:53.333
COMING UP...

22:53.333 --> 22:55.767
HIT IT LIKE YOU MEAN IT.

22:55.767 --> 22:57.333
[bleep], THIS IS HARD!

22:57.333 --> 22:58.000
AND LATER...

22:58.000 --> 22:58.800
THIS IS NEW YORK CITY.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.600
THIS IS MY [bleep] TOWN, OKAY?

23:00.600 --> 23:01.733
I KNOW WHAT GOES ON HERE.

23:01.733 --> 23:02.467
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

23:02.467 --> 23:03.233
YOU'VE GOT TILL THE END OF THE

23:03.233 --> 23:04.100
DAY.

23:04.100 --> 23:06.067
THEY GO, OR I GO.

23:11.800 --> 23:16.067
LET'S GO, GUYS!

23:16.067 --> 23:17.000
TODAY IS A BIG DAY.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.100
THIS WHOLE PLACE IS GETTING

23:18.100 --> 23:19.300
REDONE.

23:19.300 --> 23:21.467
I HAVE 40 CONTRACTORS INSIDE.

23:21.467 --> 23:22.133
WOW.

23:22.133 --> 23:23.867
EVERYBODY FROM BUILDERS TO

23:23.867 --> 23:25.667
ELECTRICIANS TO PAINTERS.

23:25.667 --> 23:26.633
I WOULD SAY I'M GONNA END UP

23:26.633 --> 23:28.367
SPENDING WAY OVER $300,000 TO

23:28.367 --> 23:29.133
GET THIS RIGHT.

23:29.133 --> 23:31.067
I HAD ESTIMATED 200,000, BUT

23:31.067 --> 23:33.300
WHEN LICENSEES COME HERE, I NEED

23:33.300 --> 23:35.233
TO KNOW WE ARE ABSOLUTELY

23:35.233 --> 23:36.500
PUTTING OUR BEST FOOT FORWARD.

23:36.500 --> 23:37.600
SO LET'S GO INSIDE AND TAKE A

23:37.600 --> 23:43.600
LOOK.

23:43.600 --> 23:47.900
WOW.

23:47.900 --> 23:49.467
ANDREW, COME HERE, BUDDY.

23:49.467 --> 23:50.767
HOW FRUSTRATED HAVE YOU BEEN

23:50.767 --> 23:51.767
THAT YOUR BROTHER WON'T LET YOU

23:51.767 --> 23:53.200
DO STUFF?

23:53.200 --> 23:53.867
PRETTY FRUSTRATED.

23:53.867 --> 23:55.167
LET ME SEE IT.

23:55.167 --> 23:57.367
HIT IT LIKE YOU MEAN IT, THOUGH.

23:57.367 --> 23:58.900
HARDER!

23:58.900 --> 24:00.467
[bleep], YOU GUYS DO THIS ALL

24:00.467 --> 24:01.133
DAY?

24:01.133 --> 24:01.967
MARCUS WROTE A CHECK FOR

24:01.967 --> 24:04.067
$200,000 AND COUNTING.

24:04.067 --> 24:04.800
I GOTTA LIVE UP TO HIS

24:04.800 --> 24:07.300
STANDARDS.

24:20.900 --> 24:22.300
HEY, HOLD UP FOR A SECOND.

24:22.300 --> 24:23.200
WHAT'S UP?

24:23.200 --> 24:25.800
DID YOU ORDER $7,500 WORTH OF

24:25.800 --> 24:28.833
NEW FURNITURE FOR THE OFFICE?

24:28.833 --> 24:31.000
YEAH.

24:31.000 --> 24:32.467
I'M--I'M--TO SAY I'M PISSED

24:32.467 --> 24:33.933
WOULD BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT.

24:33.933 --> 24:35.367
YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE SPENT THAT

24:35.367 --> 24:36.633
MONEY WITHOUT ASKING ME, BECAUSE

24:36.633 --> 24:38.167
I'M CONTROLLING THE BUDGET.

24:38.167 --> 24:39.533
YOU'RE TOTALLY OUT OF LINE.

24:39.533 --> 24:40.633
WHAT'S YOUR EXPLANATION?

24:40.633 --> 24:41.933
THE FURNITURE THAT WE HAVE

24:41.933 --> 24:43.867
NOW, IT DOES NOT MATCH THE--THE

24:43.867 --> 24:45.667
DECOR OF--OF THE NEW WAY--

24:45.667 --> 24:48.567
OH, [bleep] YOUR DECOR, MAN!

24:48.567 --> 24:50.600
THERE'S NO [bleep] WAY YOU JU--

24:50.600 --> 24:52.967
YOU'RE GONNA SPEND $7,500 ON

24:52.967 --> 24:54.033
FURNITURE FOR THE OFFICE.

24:54.033 --> 24:56.233
ALL RIGHT, I-I GET THAT, AND

24:56.233 --> 24:57.700
I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE UPSET,

24:57.700 --> 24:59.733
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THIS IS

24:59.733 --> 25:01.000
PART OF--PART OF MY FIELD.

25:01.000 --> 25:01.667
THIS IS--I--

25:01.667 --> 25:02.867
YOUR--YOUR FIELD?

25:02.867 --> 25:03.667
TOTALLY ABSURD.

25:03.667 --> 25:04.967
DON'T SPEND MONEY ON PRETTY

25:04.967 --> 25:06.267
THINGS TO MAKE THE OFFICE LOOK

25:06.267 --> 25:06.933
NICE.

25:06.933 --> 25:07.967
NEXT TIME YOU WANT TO MAKE A

25:07.967 --> 25:10.433
$7,500 PURCHASE, YOU BETTER COME

25:10.433 --> 25:11.100
TO ME FIRST.

25:11.100 --> 25:11.900
THAT'S NUMBER ONE.

25:11.900 --> 25:13.033
NUMBER TWO, YOU BETTER CALL THIS

25:13.033 --> 25:14.500
FURNITURE COMPANY AND CANCEL THE

25:14.500 --> 25:15.167
ORDER.

25:15.167 --> 25:15.833
I'VE HAD IT, MAN.

25:15.833 --> 25:16.533
I'M [bleep] DONE WITH THIS

25:16.533 --> 25:20.667
CONVERSATION.

25:26.767 --> 25:27.467
COME HERE FOR A SECOND.

25:27.467 --> 25:28.733
YES.

25:28.733 --> 25:30.033
WHY WAS YOUR BROTHER YELLING

25:30.033 --> 25:30.700
AT YOU?

25:30.700 --> 25:31.733
IS IT OKAY WITH YOU THAT HE DOES

25:31.733 --> 25:33.667
THAT TO YOU?

25:33.667 --> 25:34.533
NO, IT'S--OF COURSE IT'S NOT

25:34.533 --> 25:35.200
OKAY.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.600
THEN WHY DO YOU ALLOW IT?

25:36.600 --> 25:37.400
YOU KNOW, THERE'S A CERTAIN

25:37.400 --> 25:38.633
LEVEL THAT HE'S, LIKE--EH, HE'S

25:38.633 --> 25:39.933
MY OLDER BROTHER AND, YOU KNOW,

25:39.933 --> 25:40.900
I-I LISTEN TO HIM.

25:40.900 --> 25:42.233
ANDREW HAS A LOT TO OFFER

25:42.233 --> 25:43.367
THIS BUSINESS, AND JON BETTER

25:43.367 --> 25:44.667
START RECOGNIZING.

25:44.667 --> 25:45.733
IF THIS BUSINESS IS GONNA

25:45.733 --> 25:47.900
SUCCEED, JON'S BEHAVIOR HAS TO

25:47.900 --> 25:48.567
STOP.

25:48.567 --> 25:49.633
HEY, JON?

25:49.633 --> 25:50.300
YES?

25:50.300 --> 25:51.867
WHY AM I HEARING FROM SOME OF

25:51.867 --> 25:53.133
THE PAINTERS THAT YOU WERE

25:53.133 --> 25:54.500
YELLING AT YOUR BROTHER EARLIER?

25:54.500 --> 25:56.067
I GOT UPSET BECAUSE HE OKAYED

25:56.067 --> 25:57.400
TO PURCHASE FURNITURE--

25:57.400 --> 25:58.233
BUT I'M PAYING FOR THE

25:58.233 --> 25:59.733
[bleep] FURNITURE.

25:59.733 --> 26:00.467
I'M PAYING FOR IT.

26:00.467 --> 26:01.133
WELL--BUT, YOUR MONEY--

26:01.133 --> 26:01.900
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK I'VE

26:01.900 --> 26:02.700
SPENT?

26:02.700 --> 26:03.933
$1/4 MILLION?

26:03.933 --> 26:04.800
MORE.

26:04.800 --> 26:05.733
HOW MUCH WAS HE ASKING YOU TO

26:05.733 --> 26:06.400
SPEND?

26:06.400 --> 26:07.100
I DON'T KNOW, A COUPLE

26:07.100 --> 26:07.767
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

26:07.767 --> 26:08.733
OKAY, SO YOUR BROTHER GOES

26:08.733 --> 26:10.900
OUT ON A LIMB TO IMPROVE WHAT

26:10.900 --> 26:12.467
YOU THINK IS GONNA BE A COUPLE

26:12.467 --> 26:13.333
THOUSAND DOLLARS...

26:13.333 --> 26:14.133
RIGHT.

26:14.133 --> 26:17.167
AND YOU LOSE YOUR MIND?

26:17.167 --> 26:18.300
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE FURNITURE,

26:18.300 --> 26:19.200
BUT IT'S ABOUT SHOWING SOME

26:19.200 --> 26:20.033
RESPECT TO HIM.

26:20.033 --> 26:21.100
YOU'RE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THIS

26:21.100 --> 26:22.433
THAN YOU ARE HIM.

26:22.433 --> 26:23.100
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

26:23.100 --> 26:23.800
WELL THEN WHY DO YOU TREAT

26:23.800 --> 26:24.467
HIM THAT WAY?

26:24.467 --> 26:25.700
BUT, IT'S ONE SITUATION--

26:25.700 --> 26:26.367
I KNOW, JON.

26:26.367 --> 26:27.100
BUT IT--BUT, MARCUS, IT WAS--

26:27.100 --> 26:28.800
JON, HE'S A HUMAN BEING.

26:28.800 --> 26:29.867
FORGET ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE'S

26:29.867 --> 26:30.967
YOUR BROTHER.

26:30.967 --> 26:32.233
WE SHOULDN'T BE TALKING TO

26:32.233 --> 26:33.500
PEOPLE THAT WAY.

26:33.500 --> 26:35.333
IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS, THESE

26:35.333 --> 26:36.200
BROTHERS NEED TO BE WORKING

26:36.200 --> 26:37.433
TOGETHER, NOT WORKING AGAINST

26:37.433 --> 26:38.100
EACH OTHER.

26:38.100 --> 26:39.067
I DIDN'T MEAN TO EMBARR--I--

26:39.067 --> 26:41.400
IF I EMBARRASSED YOU, I'M SORRY.

26:45.467 --> 26:46.300
I WANTED TO GET OUT OF THE

26:46.300 --> 26:47.333
OFFICE A LITTLE BIT AND SPEND

26:47.333 --> 26:48.733
SOME TIME WITH ANDREW.

26:48.733 --> 26:50.567
I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR HIM.

26:50.567 --> 26:51.667
I'VE BEEN VERY IMPRESSED WITH

26:51.667 --> 26:53.333
ALL YOUR IDEAS.

26:53.333 --> 26:54.433
YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE SOME

26:54.433 --> 26:55.300
CHANCES.

26:55.300 --> 26:55.967
THANKS, MARCUS.

26:55.967 --> 26:56.700
SO WHAT I DID IS, I WENT OUT

26:56.700 --> 26:59.300
ON A LIMB, AND I DON'T WANT JON

26:59.300 --> 27:00.533
TO KNOW ABOUT THIS.

27:00.533 --> 27:01.200
ABOUT WHAT?

27:01.200 --> 27:02.533
I HIRED SOME PEOPLE...

27:02.533 --> 27:03.200
UH-HUH.

27:03.200 --> 27:03.900
THAT ARE GONNA GIVE YOU THE

27:03.900 --> 27:06.467
CHANCE TO GO INTO A STUDIO FOR

27:06.467 --> 27:08.133
THREE, FOUR HOURS, AND YOU'RE

27:08.133 --> 27:10.733
GONNA BE ABLE TO MAKE A 15- AND

27:10.733 --> 27:13.433
A 30-SECOND RADIO AND TV SPOT.

27:13.433 --> 27:14.267
WOW.

27:14.267 --> 27:16.667
AND IT'S 100% UP TO YOU.

27:16.667 --> 27:17.400
WOW, THAT'S AMAZING.

27:17.400 --> 27:18.067
THANK YOU.

27:18.067 --> 27:20.800
BUT...YOU GOT TO GET IT RIGHT

27:20.800 --> 27:22.367
THE FIRST TIME.

27:22.367 --> 27:24.300
YOU GET A CHANCE, WITHOUT YOUR

27:24.300 --> 27:25.300
BROTHER INFLUENCING YOU...

27:25.300 --> 27:25.967
RIGHT.

27:25.967 --> 27:27.400
TO GET SOMETHING DONE, AND

27:27.400 --> 27:29.200
COME BACK AND SAY TO HIM, "LOOK,

27:29.200 --> 27:30.300
YOU SAID I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO

27:30.300 --> 27:32.600
MAKE A COMMERCIAL.

27:32.600 --> 27:34.000
HERE'S MY SPOT."

27:34.000 --> 27:35.533
I HOPE THAT JON WILL FINALLY SEE

27:35.533 --> 27:36.900
THAT ANDREW HAS A LOT TO OFFER

27:36.900 --> 27:37.600
THIS BUSINESS.

27:37.600 --> 27:39.767
I-I DEFINITELY FEEL PRESSURE.

27:39.767 --> 27:40.533
HE DOUBTS ME.

27:40.533 --> 27:42.800
IN HIS MIND, HE DOESN'T SEE ME,

27:42.800 --> 27:44.233
UH, ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING.

27:44.233 --> 27:46.367
NOTHING SHUTS PEOPLE UP LIKE

27:46.367 --> 27:47.333
PERFORMANCE.

27:47.333 --> 27:48.633
PERFORMANCE AND SUCCESS.

27:48.633 --> 27:49.933
PERFORMANCE AND SUCCESS.

27:49.933 --> 27:50.900
LET'S GO GET TO WORK.

27:50.900 --> 27:53.700
YOU GOT IT.

28:03.533 --> 28:04.200
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

28:04.200 --> 28:04.867
HI, HOW'S IT GOING?

28:04.867 --> 28:05.567
WHAT'S UP? I'M JON.

28:05.567 --> 28:06.533
I'M JAKE.

28:06.533 --> 28:07.333
NICE TO MEET YOU, JAKE.

28:07.333 --> 28:08.267
SO WHAT'S COOKING?

28:08.267 --> 28:08.967
I'M JUST INTERESTED IN

28:08.967 --> 28:11.000
SELLING MY CAR.

28:11.000 --> 28:11.700
SO, WHAT DO WE HAVE HERE, A

28:11.700 --> 28:13.033
2011?

28:13.033 --> 28:13.767
YEAH.

28:13.767 --> 28:14.733
OKAY, WHAT'S THE MILEAGE?

28:14.733 --> 28:16.267
OH, IT'S ABOUT 26,000 MILES.

28:16.267 --> 28:17.233
OKAY, LET ME TAKE A QUICK

28:17.233 --> 28:18.100
LOOK AROUND THE CAR...

28:18.100 --> 28:18.767
YEAH, SURE.

28:18.767 --> 28:19.500
AND WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT,

28:19.500 --> 28:20.167
OKAY?

28:20.167 --> 28:23.333
YOU JUST HANG TIGHT.

28:23.333 --> 28:24.567
IF I GAVE 16,000, YOU'D PAY

28:24.567 --> 28:25.700
17,000 FOR IT?

28:25.700 --> 28:26.367
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

28:26.367 --> 28:27.033
YEAH, I WOULD.

28:27.033 --> 28:27.867
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT--THAT'S

28:27.867 --> 28:28.533
WHAT I THOUGHT.

28:28.533 --> 28:31.067
I THINK I WOULD, YEAH.

28:31.067 --> 28:31.833
YEAH, THE WHEELS NEED SOME

28:31.833 --> 28:32.500
RECONDITIONING.

28:32.500 --> 28:33.167
YEAH.

28:33.167 --> 28:34.167
JON IS OUTSIDE APPRAISING A

28:34.167 --> 28:35.967
CAR, AND I SEE TWO WHOLESALERS

28:35.967 --> 28:37.300
HOVERING AROUND THE CAR.

28:37.300 --> 28:38.867
I THOUGHT WE WERE PAST THIS.

28:38.867 --> 28:39.767
ARE YOU, UH--ARE YOU SELLING

28:39.767 --> 28:42.033
THIS CAR?

28:42.033 --> 28:42.733
NO, I'M JUST A BUYER.

28:42.733 --> 28:43.400
NO, NO, HE'S NOT THE

28:43.400 --> 28:44.200
CUSTOMER, THEY'RE--

28:44.200 --> 28:45.000
WE'RE BUYERS.

28:45.000 --> 28:45.733
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU'RE

28:45.733 --> 28:47.167
BUYERS?

28:47.167 --> 28:48.867
TRIED TO BUY THE CAR.

28:48.867 --> 28:49.567
OKAY, THESE--THESE ARE THE

28:49.567 --> 28:52.367
WHOLESALERS.

28:52.367 --> 28:53.100
GUYS, GIVE US A MINUTE.

28:53.100 --> 28:53.933
LET ME TALK TO HIM A SECOND,

28:53.933 --> 28:54.600
OKAY?

28:54.600 --> 28:55.267
YEAH, OKAY.

28:55.267 --> 28:56.000
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.867
I TOLD JON SPECIFICALLY TO GET

28:57.867 --> 28:59.200
RID OF THESE WHOLESALERS.

28:59.200 --> 29:00.967
HAVING THEM HERE IS COSTING THIS

29:00.967 --> 29:02.600
BUSINESS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

29:02.600 --> 29:03.633
OF DOLLARS.

29:03.633 --> 29:05.133
IF HE DOESN'T CHANGE HIS WAYS,

29:05.133 --> 29:06.567
HE'S GOING TO PUT HIMSELF OUT OF

29:06.567 --> 29:08.767
BUSINESS.

29:08.767 --> 29:09.933
HEY, LOOK, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU

29:09.933 --> 29:11.567
THOUGHT THIS WAS MY FIRST RODEO,

29:11.567 --> 29:12.867
BUT MY JOB HERE IS TO MAKE

29:12.867 --> 29:14.767
MONEY, FOR MYSELF AND FOR YOU.

29:14.767 --> 29:16.433
I DON'T GET IT.

29:16.433 --> 29:17.633
THEY'RE TAKING [bleep] MARGIN

29:17.633 --> 29:18.400
RIGHT OUT OF YOUR POCKET.

29:18.400 --> 29:19.067
OKAY.

29:19.067 --> 29:19.733
DO YOU NOT SEE THAT?

29:19.733 --> 29:20.467
WHO THE HELL AM I GONNA SELL

29:20.467 --> 29:21.300
MY CARS TO?

29:21.300 --> 29:22.133
DEALERS.

29:22.133 --> 29:23.300
THESE GUYS ARE GREAT BUYERS.

29:23.300 --> 29:24.300
THEY KNOW HOW TO LOOK AT A CAR.

29:24.300 --> 29:25.033
THEY'RE GREAT WITH PEOPLE.

29:25.033 --> 29:26.267
THEN HIRE 'EM!

29:26.267 --> 29:27.300
I'D LOVE TO HIRE THEM.

29:27.300 --> 29:28.633
THEN WHY DON'T YOU?

29:28.633 --> 29:29.667
BECAUSE I NEED THEM TO SELL

29:29.667 --> 29:30.900
CARS TOO, ALSO, BECAUSE THEY PAY

29:30.900 --> 29:31.800
ME A LOT OF MONEY, TOO, FOR

29:31.800 --> 29:32.567
CARS.

29:32.567 --> 29:33.233
BUT, THEY'RE TAK--

29:33.233 --> 29:34.133
AND THEY'RE HONEST GUYS.

29:34.133 --> 29:35.333
THESE GUYS AREN'T DISHONEST.

29:35.333 --> 29:36.100
THEY'RE HONEST GUYS.

29:36.100 --> 29:36.867
IT'S NOT ABOUT THEM BEING

29:36.867 --> 29:38.233
HONEST OR DISHONEST, IT'S ABOUT

29:38.233 --> 29:40.067
HAVING THE FOX IN THE HENHOUSE.

29:40.067 --> 29:41.033
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE TO

29:41.033 --> 29:41.700
ME...

29:41.700 --> 29:42.433
BUT THEY'RE NOT THE FOX!

29:42.433 --> 29:43.333
THAT YOU MAKE YOUR LIVING...

29:43.333 --> 29:44.000
THEY'RE NOT THE FOX.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.067
OFF OF SELLING CARS, AND THE

29:45.067 --> 29:45.767
MARGIN BETWEEN THOSE CARS.

29:45.767 --> 29:46.500
OKAY.

29:46.500 --> 29:48.133
IF YOU BUY A CAR FOR 10,000,

29:48.133 --> 29:49.133
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MARKET

29:49.133 --> 29:49.800
IS.

29:49.800 --> 29:50.533
YOU SELL IT TO THEM FOR 11,000,

29:50.533 --> 29:51.667
THEY'RE SELLING IT FOR 12,000.

29:51.667 --> 29:53.200
THE ONLY REASON THEY'RE HERE IS

29:53.200 --> 29:54.067
BECAUSE THEY MAKE A SPREAD

29:54.067 --> 29:55.933
BETWEEN YOU AND THE NEXT PERSON.

29:55.933 --> 29:57.433
TIME OUT.

29:57.433 --> 29:58.933
IN YOUR WORLD, MAYBE THAT'S HOW

29:58.933 --> 30:00.000
IT WORKS, OKAY?

30:00.000 --> 30:01.100
BUT IN MY WORLD, IT'S DIFFERENT,

30:01.100 --> 30:01.767
OKAY?

30:01.767 --> 30:03.167
THIS ISN'T BAKERSFIELD,

30:03.167 --> 30:05.200
CALIFORNIA, THIS ISN'T DALLAS,

30:05.200 --> 30:07.233
TEXAS, THIS ISN'T CHICAGO.

30:07.233 --> 30:07.967
THIS IS NEW YORK CITY.

30:07.967 --> 30:09.800
THIS IS MY [bleep] TOWN, OKAY?

30:09.800 --> 30:11.300
I KNOW WHAT GOES ON HERE, AND I

30:11.300 --> 30:13.100
KNOW MY GUYS.

30:13.100 --> 30:14.133
DON'T TELL ME ABOUT MY GUYS.

30:14.133 --> 30:14.867
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

30:14.867 --> 30:15.667
YOU'VE GOT TILL THE END OF THE

30:15.667 --> 30:17.233
DAY.

30:17.233 --> 30:21.900
THEY GO, OR I GO.

30:21.900 --> 30:22.567
COMING UP...

30:22.567 --> 30:24.233
I-I HAVE TO CUT YOU GUYS OUT.

30:24.233 --> 30:29.033
THAT'S YOUR FINAL DECISION?

30:29.033 --> 30:29.700
AND LATER...

30:29.700 --> 30:31.200
SELLING YOUR CAR?

30:31.200 --> 30:31.867
both: NO.

30:31.867 --> 30:32.867
SELLING YOUR CAR?

30:32.867 --> 30:33.667
both: NO, NO, NO, NO.

30:33.667 --> 30:34.533
YOU'VE GOT TO GET IT RIGHT.

30:34.533 --> 30:36.500
SELLING YOUR CAR?

30:45.067 --> 30:46.933
GOT TO PAINT THE WHOLE HOOD.

30:46.933 --> 30:47.700
HEY, GUYS, I'VE GOT TO TALK

30:47.700 --> 30:48.600
TO YOU FOR A SECOND, SORRY.

30:48.600 --> 30:52.033
OKAY, MAN.

30:52.033 --> 30:52.933
LOOK, I'VE GOT TO MAKE SOME

30:52.933 --> 30:53.800
CHANGES AROUND HERE.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.000
THIS IS NOT GONNA BE EASY FOR ME

30:55.000 --> 30:56.267
BECAUSE, I MEAN, I'M VERY LOYAL

30:56.267 --> 30:57.167
TO PEOPLE.

30:57.167 --> 30:58.133
I JUST CAN'T HAVE YOU GUYS HERE

30:58.133 --> 30:58.800
ANYMORE.

30:58.800 --> 30:59.467
I'M SORRY.

30:59.467 --> 31:02.067
I-I HAVE TO CUT YOU GUYS OUT.

31:04.100 --> 31:05.400
WE'VE BEEN HERE SINCE YOUR

31:05.400 --> 31:06.700
FATHER WAS AROUND.

31:06.700 --> 31:07.767
I KNOW.

31:07.767 --> 31:08.867
AND WE'VE BEEN DOING BUSINESS

31:08.867 --> 31:10.100
WITH HIM FROM--FOR YEARS.

31:10.100 --> 31:10.767
I'M SORRY, MAN.

31:10.767 --> 31:12.167
IT'S--IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL.

31:12.167 --> 31:13.000
I HAVE TO STAY AFLOAT.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.200
I HAVE TO STAY ALIVE, HERE.

31:14.200 --> 31:16.133
SO THAT'S IT FOR NOW, RIGHT?

31:16.133 --> 31:17.167
THAT'S YOUR FINAL DECISION?

31:17.167 --> 31:18.067
YOU GUYS HAVE TO GO.

31:18.067 --> 31:21.533
SORRY.

31:21.533 --> 31:22.467
YOU KNOW WHAT, MAN?

31:22.467 --> 31:27.000
FORGET ABOUT YOU, ALL RIGHT?

31:27.000 --> 31:28.200
IS THIS YOU CHANGING YOUR WAY

31:28.200 --> 31:29.833
OF DOING BUSINESS?

31:29.833 --> 31:30.933
I'M CHANGING EVERYTHING.

31:30.933 --> 31:32.033
I'M DOING A 180.

31:32.033 --> 31:33.333
IT'S YOUR BUSINESS.

31:33.333 --> 31:34.900
YOU GOTTA DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.

31:34.900 --> 31:36.333
IT'S HARD TO CUT TIES WITH

31:36.333 --> 31:37.567
PEOPLE YOU'VE DONE BUSINESS WITH

31:37.567 --> 31:38.567
FOR YEARS.

31:38.567 --> 31:39.767
BUT IN ORDER FOR THIS BUSINESS

31:39.767 --> 31:42.000
TO SURVIVE AND MAKE REAL MONEY,

31:42.000 --> 31:43.600
THE MIDDLEMEN, THE WHOLESALERS,

31:43.600 --> 31:48.733
HAVE TO GO.

31:48.733 --> 31:50.433
[engine roars]

31:50.433 --> 31:51.800
TODAY I'M TAKING ANDREW TO THE

31:51.800 --> 31:53.033
RECORDING STUDIO TO MAKE THIS

31:53.033 --> 31:53.700
COMMERCIAL.

31:53.700 --> 31:55.433
I AM REALLY EXCITED.

31:55.433 --> 31:56.667
SO, ANDREW, YOU READY FOR THIS?

31:56.667 --> 31:57.833
I AM READY.

31:57.833 --> 31:58.900
DID YOU WRITE THE SPOT?

31:58.900 --> 31:59.567
ABSOLUTELY.

31:59.567 --> 32:00.433
LET ME SEE IT.

32:00.433 --> 32:01.667
WHAT I'M REALLY PROUD OF IS THAT

32:01.667 --> 32:02.967
ANDREW DID A GOOD JOB PREPARING

32:02.967 --> 32:03.633
FOR THIS.

32:03.633 --> 32:04.967
HE WROTE OUT THE SCRIPT.

32:04.967 --> 32:05.633
HE TIMED IT.

32:05.633 --> 32:06.733
HE PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT INTO THE

32:06.733 --> 32:07.700
WORDS.

32:07.700 --> 32:09.100
I'M--I'M THINKING HE'S GONNA DO

32:09.100 --> 32:11.567
A GREAT JOB.

32:11.567 --> 32:12.233
OH, HEY, DOUG.

HEY.

32:12.900 --> 32:13.567

32:14.900 --> 32:15.567
ANDREW.

32:15.567 --> 32:16.233
HI, I'M ANDREW.

32:16.233 --> 32:16.900
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

32:16.900 --> 32:17.633

32:18.333 --> 32:19.000
YEAH, LET'S DO IT.

32:19.000 --> 32:19.667
WE JUST NEED TO MAKE SURE

32:19.667 --> 32:20.900

32:27.233 --> 32:28.667
OKAY, WE'RE ROLLING WHENEVER

32:28.667 --> 32:29.933
YOU'RE COMFORTABLE.

32:29.933 --> 32:31.167

32:31.167 --> 32:33.233
THEN CALL 1-800-CARCASH.

32:33.233 --> 32:34.100
WE'RE GONNA STOP.

32:34.100 --> 32:34.967
WE'RE--WE'RE GONNA STOP.

32:34.967 --> 32:36.433
THAT "SELLING YOUR CAR" IS TOO

32:36.433 --> 32:37.100
SOFT.

32:37.100 --> 32:37.767
ALL RIGHT.

32:37.767 --> 32:38.433
STRONG, ANDREW.

32:38.433 --> 32:39.500
[forcefully] SELLING YOUR CAR?

32:39.500 --> 32:40.533
ALL RIGHT.

32:40.533 --> 32:42.133
SELLING YOUR CAR?

32:42.133 --> 32:42.933

32:42.933 --> 32:44.700
SELLING YOUR CAR?

32:44.700 --> 32:45.933
NOW, INSTEAD OF GOING DOWN,

32:45.933 --> 32:47.600
I WANT YOU TO STAY UP AND STRONG

32:47.600 --> 32:48.267
ALL THE WAY THROUGH.

32:48.267 --> 32:49.400
[forcefully] SELLING YOUR CAR?

32:49.400 --> 32:50.300

32:53.667 --> 32:54.700
IT'S REALLY ABOUT HIM GETTING

32:54.700 --> 32:55.367
HIS CONFIDENCE.

32:55.367 --> 32:56.033
YEAH.

32:56.033 --> 32:56.700
RIGHT?

32:56.700 --> 32:57.367
YEAH, BEING COMFORTABLE.

32:57.367 --> 32:58.533
IT'S GOT TO SOUND LIKE YOU'RE

32:58.533 --> 32:59.267
PISSED.

32:59.267 --> 33:00.567
OKAY.

33:00.567 --> 33:01.833
IT--IT TAKES A LONG TIME FOR ME

33:01.833 --> 33:03.100
TO GET PISSED, SO...

33:03.100 --> 33:04.400
WELL, THE BOSS IS COMING, AND

33:04.400 --> 33:06.033
THE BOSS IS PISSED, SO IT'S NOT

33:06.033 --> 33:07.633
GONNA TAKE TOO MUCH LONGER.

33:07.633 --> 33:09.867
I WANT YOU TO READ THIS LIKE

33:09.867 --> 33:10.900
YOUR BROTHER JUST TOLD YOU YOU

33:10.900 --> 33:12.533
WERE A DUMBASS.

33:12.533 --> 33:13.867
OH, GREAT.

33:13.867 --> 33:15.233
LET'S GO.

33:15.233 --> 33:16.833
[angrily] SELLING YOUR CAR?

33:16.833 --> 33:17.700
I COULD WORK WITH THAT.

33:17.700 --> 33:18.367
YEAH.

33:18.367 --> 33:19.033
THAT FEELS BETTER.

33:19.033 --> 33:19.700
YEAH.

33:19.700 --> 33:20.567
THAT FEELS BETTER, ANDREW.

33:20.567 --> 33:22.100
OH! AGAIN?

33:22.100 --> 33:22.967
READ IT THAT WAY.

33:22.967 --> 33:23.733
BE PISSED.

33:23.733 --> 33:24.667
NO HASSLE.

33:24.667 --> 33:25.567
NO HASSLE!

33:25.567 --> 33:26.333
NO HASSLE!

33:26.333 --> 33:27.300
SCREW OFF!

33:27.300 --> 33:28.233
NO HASSLE!

33:28.233 --> 33:30.167
JUST INSTANT CASH!

33:30.167 --> 33:31.067
NICE.

33:31.067 --> 33:32.600
THAT WAS GOOD, ANDREW.

33:32.600 --> 33:33.733
GREAT JOB.

33:33.733 --> 33:36.000
VERY MUCH.

33:43.633 --> 33:45.067
THE MANHATTAN CAR CASH

33:45.067 --> 33:46.400
LOCATION IS GONNA BE MY

33:46.400 --> 33:47.400
FLAGSHIP.

33:47.400 --> 33:48.233
IT'S MY PROTOTYPE.

33:48.233 --> 33:49.167
IT HAS TO BE RIGHT.

33:49.167 --> 33:50.567
IT'S GONNA SET THE STANDARD FOR

33:50.567 --> 33:51.800
EVERY OTHER LICENSEE AND

33:51.800 --> 33:52.933
LOCATION THAT OPENS IN THIS

33:52.933 --> 33:53.667
COUNTRY.

33:53.667 --> 33:54.800
WE'RE REBUILDING ALL OF THE

33:54.800 --> 33:56.500
OFFICES TO MAXIMIZE THE SPACE

33:56.500 --> 33:57.167
BETTER.

33:57.167 --> 33:58.733
WE'RE REDOING THE UNEVEN AND

33:58.733 --> 34:00.300
DIRTY FLOORS.

34:00.300 --> 34:01.467
WE'RE PAINTING THE WALLS AND

34:01.467 --> 34:03.233
CEILING WITH THE NEW COLORS.

34:03.233 --> 34:04.700
WE'RE REPLACING THE ENTIRE

34:04.700 --> 34:06.733
STOREFRONT SO THAT CUSTOMERS CAN

34:06.733 --> 34:08.567
SEE IN, AND EMPLOYEES CAN SEE

34:08.567 --> 34:09.233
OUT.

34:09.233 --> 34:10.167
THIS ISN'T SHATTERPROOF.

34:10.167 --> 34:10.833
YES, IT IS.

34:10.833 --> 34:11.500
IT IS?

34:11.500 --> 34:12.167
OH, YEAH.

34:12.167 --> 34:12.833
WE'RE REPLACING THE

34:12.833 --> 34:14.367
DILAPIDATED AWNING WITH A BRIGHT

34:14.367 --> 34:15.500
NEW ONE.

34:15.500 --> 34:17.433
WHAT IF WE PUT SOME PLEXIGLASS,

34:17.433 --> 34:18.100
THEIR LOGO...

34:18.100 --> 34:19.600
STRONG COLORS--RIGHT.

34:19.600 --> 34:20.367
BACKLIT.

34:20.367 --> 34:21.033
THAT WORKS.

34:21.033 --> 34:21.699
LET'S DO IT.

34:21.699 --> 34:22.500
WE'RE IMPROVING THE LIGHTING SO

34:22.500 --> 34:23.632
IT'S MORE INVITING, AND WE CAN

34:23.632 --> 34:25.333
SEE THE CARS BETTER.

34:25.333 --> 34:26.433
IS THIS AS BRIGHT AS IT'S GONNA

34:26.433 --> 34:27.100
GET?

34:27.100 --> 34:28.266
WE'RE ACTUALLY IN THE PROCESS

34:28.266 --> 34:30.033
OF CHANGING THOSE OUT RIGHT NOW,

34:30.033 --> 34:31.067
AND THEN YOU CAN TELL ME IF YOU

34:31.067 --> 34:33.400
WANT TO ADD MORE.

34:33.400 --> 34:34.766
WE'RE UPDATING THE ELECTRICITY

34:34.766 --> 34:36.333
AND THE WIRING.

34:36.333 --> 34:37.733
WE'RE REBUILDING THE BATHROOMS

34:37.733 --> 34:39.000
FROM SCRATCH, SO THE CUSTOMERS

34:39.000 --> 34:40.400
AND THE EMPLOYEES AREN'T SCARED

34:40.400 --> 34:41.167
TO USE THEM.

34:41.167 --> 34:42.367
AND WE'RE ADDING A NEW SALES

34:42.367 --> 34:43.667
AREA, SO THE CUSTOMERS CAN FEEL

34:43.667 --> 34:44.400
LIKE THEY'RE PART OF THE

34:44.400 --> 34:45.367
PROCESS.

34:45.367 --> 34:47.800
HEY, JON, COME ON OVER.

34:47.800 --> 34:48.500
WOW.

34:48.500 --> 34:50.233
WHEN YOU LICENSE A BUSINESS,

34:50.233 --> 34:51.600
YOU HAVE TO ALSO LICENSE YOUR

34:51.600 --> 34:53.533
IMAGE, SO I'VE REBRANDED THE

34:53.533 --> 34:54.800
COMPANY, INCLUDING GETTING

34:54.800 --> 34:56.400
UNIFORMS FOR OUR EMPLOYEES.

34:56.400 --> 34:57.800
IT'S--IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT

34:57.800 --> 34:58.467
FEEL.

34:58.467 --> 35:00.067
WE LOOK LEGIT.

35:04.367 --> 35:05.600
I'M VERY HAPPY WITH THE

35:05.600 --> 35:06.333
PROGRESS.

35:06.333 --> 35:08.267
I SPENT WAY MORE THAN EXPECTED.

35:08.267 --> 35:11.167
I'VE SPENT OVER $350,000, BUT I

35:11.167 --> 35:12.433
KNOW IT'S GOT TO BE RIGHT IF

35:12.433 --> 35:14.133
THIS IS THE PROTOTYPE.

35:14.133 --> 35:15.300
I'M CONFIDENT THAT I'M GONNA GET

35:15.300 --> 35:16.733
MY MONEY BACK AFTER FOUR OR FIVE

35:16.733 --> 35:18.700
LICENSEES, AND AFTER THAT

35:18.700 --> 35:19.500
THERE'S GOING TO BE A REALLY

35:19.500 --> 35:20.367
NICE PROFIT.

35:20.367 --> 35:22.433
IT'S CLEAN, IT'S BRIGHT, IT'S

35:22.433 --> 35:23.733
VERY PROFESSIONAL-LOOKING.

35:23.733 --> 35:25.933
I MEAN, THIS IS A CAN'T-MISS.

35:25.933 --> 35:26.667
TO SAY THAT THIS IS A

35:26.667 --> 35:27.533
TRANSFORMATION IS AN

35:27.533 --> 35:28.733
UNDERSTATEMENT.

35:28.733 --> 35:29.400
[exhales sharply]

35:29.400 --> 35:31.867
IT'S, UH, QUITE OVERWHELMING.

35:31.867 --> 35:33.400
I-I WISH MY FATHER WAS ALIVE TO

35:33.400 --> 35:36.367
SEE THIS, TO SHOW HIM HIS NEW...

35:40.400 --> 35:41.800
I WISH HE WAS HERE.

35:41.800 --> 35:45.833
HE WOULD HAVE LOVED THIS.

35:45.833 --> 35:47.767
HE LOVED THIS PLACE SO MUCH.

35:47.767 --> 35:48.733
THIS WAS HIS BABY.

35:48.733 --> 35:59.200
THIS WAS--HE'S STILL HERE.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.700
IT'S NOW TIME TO SEE WHAT JON

36:00.700 --> 36:01.633
HAS LEARNED ABOUT DOING

36:01.633 --> 36:02.600
APPRAISALS.

36:02.600 --> 36:04.100
I EXPECT HIM TO MAKE A BIGGER

36:04.100 --> 36:04.800
PROFIT.

36:04.800 --> 36:06.433
THE WHOLE PROCESS, OKAY?

36:06.433 --> 36:07.800
YEAH.

36:07.800 --> 36:08.533
HEY, GUYS.

36:08.533 --> 36:09.200
HEY.

36:09.200 --> 36:10.233
HOW YOU DOING TODAY?

36:10.233 --> 36:10.900
MY NAME IS JON.

36:10.900 --> 36:11.567
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

36:11.567 --> 36:12.233
VIC.

36:12.233 --> 36:12.900
VIC, NICE TO MEET YOU.

36:12.900 --> 36:13.567
I'M LIZZIE.

36:13.567 --> 36:14.233
NICE TO MEET YOU.

36:14.233 --> 36:14.900
NICE TO MEET YOU, TOO.

36:14.900 --> 36:15.567
PLEASURE.

36:15.567 --> 36:16.233
LET ME EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT

36:16.233 --> 36:16.900
ABOUT WHAT WE DO HERE.

36:16.900 --> 36:17.567
SURE.

36:17.567 --> 36:18.367
WE'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THE CAR.

36:18.367 --> 36:19.933
I'LL SCAN THE VIN NUMBER.

36:19.933 --> 36:21.667
I'LL ASSESS A VALUE TO THE CAR.

36:21.667 --> 36:22.700
I HOPE I CAN MEET YOUR

36:22.700 --> 36:23.800
EXPECTATION LEVELS.

36:23.800 --> 36:24.567
WHAT WERE YOU GUYS TRYING TO GET

36:24.567 --> 36:26.533
FOR IT?

36:29.900 --> 36:31.133
IT--IT'S NOT WHAT A BOOK SAYS A

36:31.133 --> 36:32.267
CAR IS WORTH, IT'S WHAT SOMEONE

36:32.267 --> 36:33.500
OFFERS YOU FOR THE CAR.

36:33.500 --> 36:34.367
SO, LET'S START IN THE FRONT OF

36:34.367 --> 36:36.333
THE CAR.

36:36.333 --> 36:37.400
I HAPPENED TO NOTICE WHEN YOU

36:37.400 --> 36:38.300
GUYS WERE PULLING IN, THERE WAS

36:38.300 --> 36:39.767
A LITTLE--THERE'S SOME DAMAGE ON

36:39.767 --> 36:40.433
THE BOTTOM.

36:40.433 --> 36:41.100
YEAH.

36:41.100 --> 36:42.933
SOME SCRAPES.

36:42.933 --> 36:44.067
I NOTICE THE WHEELS ARE A LITTLE

36:44.067 --> 36:45.867
SCUFFED ALSO.

36:45.867 --> 36:46.700
THAT'S, LIKE, THE ONLY RIM THAT

36:46.700 --> 36:47.633
DIDN'T GET DAMAGED.

36:47.633 --> 36:48.767
ON MOST CARS, IT'S NOT THE END

36:48.767 --> 36:49.700
OF THE WORLD, BUT UNFORTUNATELY

36:49.700 --> 36:51.600
ON A BMW, YOU KNOW, FOUR RIMS

36:51.600 --> 36:56.233
COULD COST WELL OVER $1,000.

36:56.233 --> 36:57.433
CLEAN HISTORY, GOOD.

36:57.433 --> 36:58.567
YEAH.

36:58.567 --> 36:59.233
WE HAVE A LITTLE

36:59.233 --> 37:00.500
RECONDITIONING TO DO AROUND THE

37:00.500 --> 37:01.467
CAR.

37:01.467 --> 37:02.433
BASED ON WHAT I JUST POINTED

37:02.433 --> 37:04.867
OUT--THE RIMS, THE BUMPERS--I'D

37:04.867 --> 37:09.367
LIKE TO PAY 14,000 FOR IT.

37:14.033 --> 37:15.333
YEAH.

37:15.333 --> 37:17.133
OKAY.

37:17.133 --> 37:18.600
JON DID A GREAT JOB ON THE

37:18.600 --> 37:19.267
APPRAISAL.

37:19.267 --> 37:21.067
HE HELD FIRM WITH THE CUSTOMER,

37:21.067 --> 37:22.600
AND NOW HE'S DOUBLING HIS PROFIT

37:22.600 --> 37:24.933
ON THAT PURCHASE.

37:24.933 --> 37:26.500
I'M INTRODUCING JON TO AN AUTO

37:26.500 --> 37:27.533
DEALER IN NEW JERSEY.

37:27.533 --> 37:29.000
I HAVE HIGH EXPECTATIONS THAT HE

37:29.000 --> 37:30.400
IS GONNA DRAMATICALLY INCREASE

37:30.400 --> 37:31.400
HIS MARGINS.

37:31.400 --> 37:32.700
I'M EXPECTING HIM TO MAKE $3,000

37:32.700 --> 37:34.667
TO $4,000 MORE PER CAR.

37:35.700 --> 37:36.767
HEY.

37:36.767 --> 37:37.433
HOW'S EVERYTHING?

37:37.433 --> 37:38.167
MICHAEL. WHAT'S UP?

37:38.167 --> 37:39.200
HEY, MICHAEL. MARCUS.

37:39.200 --> 37:39.867
PLEASURE.

37:39.867 --> 37:40.533
HEY, NICE TO MEET YOU.

37:40.533 --> 37:41.233
HOW ARE YOU?

37:41.233 --> 37:42.633
A BEAUTIFUL BMW FOR YOU.

37:42.633 --> 37:43.300
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

37:43.300 --> 37:44.033
I GOT TO LOOK AT IT.

37:44.033 --> 37:44.767
IT'S DEFINITELY FRONTLINE

37:44.767 --> 37:45.433
MATERIAL.

37:45.433 --> 37:46.100
AS LONG AS THE NUMBER IS

37:46.100 --> 37:47.000
GOOD, WE'RE IN.

37:47.000 --> 37:48.167
'07, MILEAGE IN THE 60s.

37:48.167 --> 37:48.833
TAKE A LOOK.

37:48.833 --> 37:49.567
DO YOU MIND IF I TAKE A LOOK?

37:49.567 --> 37:50.233
GO AHEAD, GO AHEAD.

37:50.233 --> 37:50.900
OKAY.

37:50.900 --> 37:52.667
OKAY.

37:52.667 --> 37:54.133
THE CAR RAN BRAND-NEW.

37:54.133 --> 37:54.800
YEAH, THESE USUALLY DO.

37:54.800 --> 37:55.633
COLD A/C, PAINT IS STILL--

37:55.633 --> 37:57.467
THEY USUALLY DO RUN GREAT.

37:57.467 --> 37:59.033
[clears throat]

37:59.033 --> 38:01.267
GOOD TIRES.

38:01.267 --> 38:03.067
IT'S ALL UP TO THE NUMBER.

38:03.067 --> 38:03.800
I'M GONNA PUT YOU ON THE

38:03.800 --> 38:04.467
MONEY.

38:04.467 --> 38:06.167
I WANT TO START THIS OFF RIGHT.

38:06.167 --> 38:09.033
17,500.

38:09.033 --> 38:10.400
I WAS THINKING MORE CLOSER TO

38:10.400 --> 38:11.767
16,000.

38:11.767 --> 38:13.733
WOULD THAT WORK?

38:13.733 --> 38:14.467
IT WOULD WORK IF THE CAR

38:14.467 --> 38:15.333
WASN'T SO NICE.

38:15.333 --> 38:16.567
IT WAS AN ORIGINAL OWNER CAR.

38:16.567 --> 38:17.533
THE CUSTOMERS TOOK VERY GOOD

38:17.533 --> 38:18.200
CARE OF THIS CAR.

38:18.200 --> 38:19.367
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE A 30K OR

38:19.367 --> 38:20.033
40K.

38:20.033 --> 38:21.667
IT HAS 60,000 MILES.

38:21.667 --> 38:23.100
IT'S RETAIL-READY.

38:23.100 --> 38:27.067
17,500. COME ON, MAN.

38:27.067 --> 38:29.933

38:41.000 --> 38:42.733
WOW. IT'S GOT A CLEAN VEHICLE

38:42.733 --> 38:43.600
HISTORY.

38:43.600 --> 38:44.867
THE CAR IS RETAIL READY,

38:44.867 --> 38:45.600
BRAND-NEW TIRES.

38:45.600 --> 38:47.967
MAINTENANCE RECORDS, ONE OWNER.

38:47.967 --> 38:49.133
I'LL GO 17,500, JUST 'CAUSE

38:49.133 --> 38:50.900
IT NEEDS NOTHING.

38:50.900 --> 38:51.700
I REALLY WANT TO GET 17,500.

38:51.700 --> 38:53.233
I'LL GO 17,200.

38:53.233 --> 38:54.000
AND, YOU KNOW WHAT?

38:54.000 --> 38:54.733
I'M GONNA BRING YOU MORE

38:54.733 --> 38:55.767
RETAIL-READY CARS.

38:55.767 --> 39:00.333
THIS IS THE FIRST OF MANY.

39:00.333 --> 39:01.867
ALL RIGHT.

39:01.867 --> 39:02.733
YOU GOT IT. I'LL TAKE IT.

39:02.733 --> 39:03.400
OKAY.

39:03.400 --> 39:04.467

39:04.467 --> 39:06.233

39:08.733 --> 39:10.533
$500 PROFIT.

39:10.533 --> 39:12.133
THIS TRANSACTION GENERATED

39:12.133 --> 39:13.867
$3,200 OF PROFIT.

39:13.867 --> 39:17.133
THAT'S A 640% INCREASE OVER WHAT

39:17.133 --> 39:18.067
THEY USED TO DO.

39:18.067 --> 39:19.767
WITH THIS NEW PROCESS IN PLACE,

39:19.767 --> 39:20.733
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

40:24.300 --> 40:25.467
WHAT WOULD YOUR DAD SAY?

40:25.467 --> 40:26.833
HE WOULD GO CRAZY FOR THAT.

40:26.833 --> 40:28.267
I KNEW, IF SOMEONE GAVE ME A

40:28.267 --> 40:29.933
CHANCE, THAT I COULD SHINE, MAN,

40:32.733 --> 40:34.233
I'M ON TEAM ANDREW, BELIEVE ME.

40:34.233 --> 40:36.033
IT WAS GREAT.

40:36.033 --> 40:37.200
I FEEL INCREDIBLY PROUD OF

40:37.200 --> 40:38.667
WHAT I'VE ACCOMPLISHED.

40:38.667 --> 40:40.100
I FEEL THAT I HAVE PROVED TO MY

TAKES TO MAKE THIS BUSINESS, UH,

40:45.133 --> 40:47.600

40:47.600 --> 40:48.367

40:48.367 --> 40:49.700
ROYALTIES FOR USING HIS VOICE?

40:49.700 --> 40:50.367
ZERO.

40:50.367 --> 40:51.533
WHEW.

40:53.867 --> 40:55.767
CAR CASH IS NOW FLOURISHING.

40:55.767 --> 40:57.333
ANDREW'S TV SPOT IS RUNNING, AND

40:57.333 --> 40:58.700
AS A RESULT OF THE NEW MARKETING

40:58.700 --> 41:01.333
PLAN, TRANSACTIONS ARE UP 30%.

THIS HAS LED TO A $2,000

41:07.033 --> 41:09.267

41:13.900 --> 41:14.900
OPENING UP LOCATIONS AS WE

41:14.900 --> 41:16.367
SPEAK.

41:16.367 --> 41:17.367
I LIKE THE IDEA THAT IT'S

41:17.367 --> 41:19.367
BEEN OPEN SINCE 1977, DOING THE

41:19.367 --> 41:21.233
SAME THING, YOU KNOW...

LIKE TO SIGN UP FOR?

41:23.433 --> 41:25.167
HOW DO I SIGN UP?

MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE

41:29.733 --> 41:31.267
RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ANDREW AND

41:31.267 --> 41:33.267
JOHN IS ON THE MEND, AND THINGS

ARE HEADED IN THE RIGHT

41:34.300 --> 41:35.333
DIRECTION.

41:35.333 --> 41:36.600
WITH THESE BASIC CHANGES,

41:36.600 --> 41:38.800
CAR CASH IS NOW PROFITABLE.

41:38.800 --> 41:40.600
I AM CONFIDENT THAT CAR CASH

41:40.600 --> 41:41.967
AND THESE TWO BROTHERS ARE GOING

41:41.967 --> 41:43.733
TO BE WILDLY SUCCESSFUL,

41:43.733 --> 41:45.100
SOMETHING THEIR FATHER WOULD BE

41:45.100 --> 41:47.900
VERY PROUD OF.
