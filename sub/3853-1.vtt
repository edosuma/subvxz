Well, hell.

That makes six of us.

04:10.751 --> 04:12.784
We all woke up, just like you.

No memories.

No idea who we are

What is this place?

04:51.759 --> 04:53.458
[man 1]
it's a ship.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.961
And looks like
we're dead in space.

04:55.963 --> 04:59.398
Systems were down
and we were venting atmospher.

04:59.400 --> 05:01.116
I was able to get us back on-lie

05:01.117 --> 05:02.833
And restore the ship's
auto-repair protocol.

05:02.836 --> 05:04.936
How'd you manage that?

05:04.938 --> 05:06.672
I don't know exactly.

05:06.674 --> 05:09.074
I was standing there at
the console and it just...

05:09.076 --> 05:11.343
...Came to me.

05:11.345 --> 05:13.645
Well, that's a good thing.

It'll all come back to
us eventually, right?

for now, we've named ourselves

05:23.657 --> 05:25.057

We've got comms.

So what do you think?

05:51.051 --> 05:53.018
We the crew of
a transport vessel

05:53.020 --> 05:54.820
On some sort of
long-range haul?

05:54.822 --> 05:56.922
Would explain what we
were doing in stasis.

Ship gets into trouble.

06:00.127 --> 06:02.361
When life support hits critical,

06:02.362 --> 06:04.596
Hazard protocols kick in and
we're automatically awakened.

06:04.598 --> 06:05.997
Wouldn't explain the

06:41.769 --> 06:43.535
And i'll be with five.

We'll use these comms
to keep in touch, yeah?

Are you going to fix it?

07:12.166 --> 07:13.765
I'm gonna try.

07:15.702 --> 07:17.469
All i'm saying is
we don't know

07:17.471 --> 07:19.070
How long we're gonna
be stuck here.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.906
It'd make sense to
choose a leader,

07:20.908 --> 07:23.108
Someone who can make key
decisions for the group.

07:23.110 --> 07:26.545
Lemme guess.
Someone like...You?

07:26.547 --> 07:28.480
No, not me necessarily,
but yeah, somebody who'll

07:28.482 --> 07:31.516
Represent everyone's
best interests.

07:31.518 --> 07:35.620
Somebody who's got final
say in case of disagreements.

07:35.622 --> 07:39.057
I don't know. Could be me.
Is that what you suggesting?

07:39.059 --> 07:40.659
No.

07:41.695 --> 07:46.097
Just between us, if
that was the case,

07:46.099 --> 07:48.200
I could use a good
second in command.

07:48.202 --> 07:49.734
Uh-huh...

how to fly this thing.

She said "it just came to her"
when she was standing

08:31.812 --> 08:33.912
At that console, but
i did the exact same thing,

08:33.914 --> 08:35.914
Trying to figure out
what buttons to push,

08:35.916 --> 08:37.115
And nothing
came to me.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.984
How do you figure that?

08:38.986 --> 08:42.087
Hell, how do you
figure any of this?

08:42.089 --> 08:44.890
No way of knowing how
long we were in those pods.

08:44.892 --> 08:48.159
Could've been days,
months, years maybe.

08:48.161 --> 08:51.162
Weird thing is it's not like our
minds have been wiped clean.

08:51.164 --> 08:54.966
If they had of been, i wouldn't
know what a pod was, or a year,

08:54.968 --> 08:56.801
Or even be able to
express myself.

08:56.803 --> 09:01.306
Language itself would be
totally alien to us, right?

09:02.709 --> 09:05.310
You're about to
blow my theory here.

Close enough.

What's up with
the robot?

13:40.821 --> 13:43.021
Technically, she's
an android.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.156
Her bio-synthetic
physiology is incredibly similar

13:45.158 --> 13:47.158
To that of our
ship's outer hull.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.760
That's fascinating.

13:48.761 --> 13:50.361
She's an extremely
efficient entity.

13:50.363 --> 13:52.030
Corrector nanites have
almost fully restored

13:52.032 --> 13:53.398

13:53.400 --> 13:55.317
Well that's not
a problem.

13:55.318 --> 13:57.235
We just stick her in
the airlock and space her.

13:57.237 --> 13:59.170
[two] that won't
be necessary.

13:59.172 --> 14:01.172
I've already deleted all of
her security directives

14:01.174 --> 14:02.874
And re-established
her base program.

14:02.876 --> 14:05.009
She's no longer
a threat to us.

14:05.011 --> 14:06.211
And she could
prove useful.

Whoa, we're not
waking that thing up.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.848
[two] the diagnostic suggests
she possesses some

14:09.850 --> 14:12.016
Sort of neural link with
the ship's mainframe.

14:12.018 --> 14:15.019
Once she's back online, she'll
be able to run a more effective

14:15.021 --> 14:18.556
Repair command, she'll have
us space-worthy in no time.

14:21.561 --> 14:25.396
She may also have some answers
for us if anybody is curious.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.902
Okay.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.437

15:13.413 --> 15:15.647
Yeah, there's a lot
of that going around.

15:15.649 --> 15:17.448
Why did you attack us?

15:17.450 --> 15:19.450
I have no memory
of such an attack.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.619
The reboot must've
wiped her data stores.

15:21.621 --> 15:23.187
Well ain't that
convenient.

15:23.189 --> 15:24.055
Whoa!

15:24.057 --> 15:25.456
Hey!

15:32.065 --> 15:35.066
I want you to initiate a neural
link with the ship's computer.

15:35.068 --> 15:37.268
Can you do that?

15:37.270 --> 15:38.703
Of course.

15:38.705 --> 15:41.506
Now i want you to access
any and all data related

15:41.508 --> 15:45.109
To the passengers
onboard this ship.

15:45.946 --> 15:48.046
No such data exists.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.715
Any information in the ship's
records about its crew,

15:50.717 --> 15:54.052
Or its mission?

15:54.054 --> 15:56.354
No such data exists.

15:56.356 --> 15:57.956
How's that possible?

15:57.958 --> 15:59.590
I-it's not.

15:59.592 --> 16:01.592
This ship's programming
is highly sophisticated.

16:01.594 --> 16:04.662
There are redundancies in place
to guard against data loss.

16:06.032 --> 16:10.001
Someone must have deliberately
deleted that information.

16:15.709 --> 16:17.976
[one] it wasn't
necessarily one of us.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.711
Yeah, then who
the hell was it?

16:19.713 --> 16:22.113
It's a big ship,
lots of places to hide.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.715
Maybe there's
someone else on board.

16:23.717 --> 16:26.117
But they'd have to know
we'd find them eventually

16:26.119 --> 16:28.720
So i'm not sure what
would be the point.

16:28.722 --> 16:30.521
We don't even
know for a fact

16:30.523 --> 16:32.457
If everyone's really
lost their memory.

16:32.459 --> 16:34.692
Any one of us could
be lying about that.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.194
I don't think so.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.196
I was the first
one to wake up,

16:38.198 --> 16:40.698
I saw that moment
in everyone's eyes...

16:40.700 --> 16:42.433
I don't think
anyone was faking.

16:42.435 --> 16:47.038
Exactly how long were you awake
before the rest of us came to?

16:47.040 --> 16:49.707
Couple of minutes,
at most, why?

16:49.709 --> 16:52.176
No way of proving that,
of course, is there?

16:52.178 --> 16:55.413
There's no way for us to know
what you were really up to.

16:55.415 --> 16:57.181
What exactly are
you suggesting.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.050
If one of us is
responsible,

16:59.052 --> 17:02.220
I would say that you are
the number one suspect.

17:02.222 --> 17:03.454
That's ridiculous.

17:03.456 --> 17:05.323
Yeah.

17:05.325 --> 17:08.259
You could jump in here
any time, you know.

17:13.500 --> 17:15.333
Chatty guy.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.657
Sleeping quarters.

17:40.460 --> 17:43.294
Uh-ahh.

17:44.731 --> 17:47.065
[android] my neural link
allows me instant access

17:47.067 --> 17:49.667
To the system from
anywhere on the ship.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.536
Manual guidance is not
only unnecessary,

17:51.538 --> 17:53.337
But it's also inefficient.

17:53.339 --> 17:54.739
We'll worry about
that later.

17:54.741 --> 17:57.341
For now, i need you to
run a full diagnostic

17:57.343 --> 17:58.342
And restore
all systems.

17:58.344 --> 18:00.745
Alright.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.247
No.

18:03.249 --> 18:05.149
Show me.

18:05.151 --> 18:06.551
Alright.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.632
What is that?

18:21.634 --> 18:23.634
It's a subspace
transmission.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.803
The ship is broadcasting
a distress signal.

18:35.748 --> 18:37.248
What're you doing?

18:37.250 --> 18:38.416
Nothin'.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.356
What are you doing?

18:45.358 --> 18:47.291
Looking for something
to treat a headache.

18:49.395 --> 18:52.763
Headaches can be caused by
blood vessel abnormalities

18:52.765 --> 18:55.299
Or brain tumors.

18:55.301 --> 18:56.801
How do you know that?

18:58.872 --> 19:00.404
I don't know.

19:00.406 --> 19:02.140
I just... Do.

19:02.876 --> 19:07.145
A tumor is a mass of cells that
multiplies uncontrollably.

19:07.147 --> 19:09.213
The human body creates
twenty-five million

19:09.215 --> 19:10.748
New cells every second.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.817
And its kidneys process

19:12.819 --> 19:15.553
One hundred and eighty
liters of blood every day.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.560
Blood will spurt
up to two meters

19:22.562 --> 19:24.362
When the carotid
artery is severed.

19:24.364 --> 19:27.298
It's a very efficient killstrok.

19:27.300 --> 19:28.933
Uh-huh...

19:37.310 --> 19:38.843
Yes!

20:50.917 --> 20:54.018
It appears the ship has
taken meteorite damage.

20:54.020 --> 20:56.287
So that's why we were
venting atmosphere.

20:56.289 --> 20:58.289
One of the forward
relays was also hit,

20:58.291 --> 21:00.725
Causing a power surge that
damaged multiple systems.

21:00.727 --> 21:03.361
It will take some
time to repair them all.

21:03.363 --> 21:06.330
Do we have engines
and navigation?

21:06.332 --> 21:07.531
Yes.

21:07.533 --> 21:09.900
What about weapons?

21:09.902 --> 21:12.036
Ship's weapons are down.

21:12.038 --> 21:13.838
Then let's make that
our next priority.

21:13.840 --> 21:16.874
Alright.

21:16.876 --> 21:18.743
No.

21:18.745 --> 21:19.877
Show me.

21:22.048 --> 21:32.890
¶

21:32.892 --> 21:34.392
[alarm sounding]

21:34.394 --> 21:36.211
What is that?

21:36.212 --> 21:38.029
It appears another vessel has
entered our scanning range.

21:38.031 --> 21:39.464
And their course?

21:39.465 --> 21:40.898
They're headed
straight for us--

21:40.900 --> 21:43.734
But i don't believe they
intend to render assistance.

21:43.736 --> 21:45.620
Why not?

21:45.621 --> 21:47.505
Because they just
launched missiles.

21:47.507 --> 21:50.474
Time to impact: Sixty seconds.

21:56.049 --> 21:58.482
[missiles racing through space]

21:59.385 --> 22:01.352
Time to impact: Fifty seconds.

22:01.354 --> 22:02.687
What can we do?

22:02.688 --> 22:04.021
The ship is also
equipped with various

22:04.023 --> 22:05.890
Counter measures i can initiate.

22:05.892 --> 22:07.692
Would you like me
to show you?

22:07.694 --> 22:08.826
Just do it!

22:19.038 --> 22:22.573
Hey, sounds like they
got the engines going.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.443
Yeah.

22:25.511 --> 22:26.711
Based on our current
acceleration,

22:26.713 --> 22:28.646
Time to impact is
now forty seconds.

22:28.648 --> 22:30.598
We can't out run it?

22:30.599 --> 22:32.549
I'm already pushing our
engines past maximum.

22:32.552 --> 22:34.118
What about a jump
to ftl?

22:34.120 --> 22:36.921
We don't have time to execute
the necessary nav calculations.

22:36.923 --> 22:38.656
Options?

22:38.657 --> 22:40.390
I could attempt further evasive
maneuvers, but at these speeds

22:40.393 --> 22:44.595
They may overtax our artificial
gravity and inertial dampeners.

22:44.597 --> 22:46.063
Do it.

22:46.399 --> 22:54.405

Hey.

23:39.485 --> 23:41.652
Wh-what happened?

23:41.654 --> 23:43.687
We lost gravity for a few
seconds there.

23:43.689 --> 23:46.123
When it came back on,
we all took a tumble.

23:46.125 --> 23:48.025
You hit your head
on the way down.

23:48.027 --> 23:48.926
I did?

23:48.928 --> 23:49.794
Yeah.

23:49.796 --> 23:51.028
You okay?

23:51.030 --> 23:52.797
Yeah, i think so.

23:56.169 --> 23:58.669
So, any idea who
attacked us, or why?

23:58.671 --> 23:59.937
None.

23:59.938 --> 24:01.204
Maybe the robot had
something to do with it.

24:01.207 --> 24:03.808
I have no intention of
harming anyone on this ship.

24:03.810 --> 24:06.811
Oh yeah, except for the part
where you nearly killed us all.

24:06.813 --> 24:08.813
I have no memory
of such an attack.

24:08.815 --> 24:09.713
So you keep saying!

24:09.715 --> 24:10.614
Alright, calm down.

24:10.616 --> 24:12.833
Are you kidding me now?

24:12.834 --> 24:15.051
I wake up a couple of hours
ago, i got no idea who i am,

24:15.054 --> 24:17.054
How the hell i got here.

24:17.056 --> 24:18.823
Nearly get killed by
the forgetful robot,

24:18.825 --> 24:20.825
Almost blasted to scrag
by some mysterious ship,

24:20.827 --> 24:23.227
And now we are floating in
the middle of who-knows-where

24:23.229 --> 24:24.695
Actually, we
do know where.

24:24.697 --> 24:28.065
We're on course for a
nearby inhabited world.

24:28.067 --> 24:28.933
We are?

24:28.935 --> 24:29.967
Before we were attacked,

24:29.969 --> 24:31.469
I initiated a
recovery program

24:31.471 --> 24:33.504
In order to salvage
recently deleted

24:33.506 --> 24:34.839
And overwritten data.

24:34.841 --> 24:36.040
You can do that?

24:36.042 --> 24:37.675
The process is
time-consuming

24:37.677 --> 24:40.044
And most of the
information is irretrievable.

24:40.046 --> 24:42.746
However, i have managed
to salvage some data.

24:42.748 --> 24:45.950
What kind of data?

24:45.952 --> 24:48.619
This ship's original destinatio.

24:48.621 --> 24:51.856

Still don't remember
hitting your head?

25:57.223 --> 25:59.223
Nope.

25:59.225 --> 26:05.563
I just remember
falling and then blackness.

26:05.565 --> 26:08.933
And--and the door.

26:18.978 --> 26:20.978
What door?

26:20.980 --> 26:24.949
In a dark
place... Underneath.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.219
A big, metal door.

26:39.799 --> 26:41.098
They keep it locked.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.833
Always.

26:50.910 --> 26:53.043
Why?

26:53.045 --> 26:55.112

31:42.902 --> 31:45.636
Remind me to tell
that robot i told you so.

31:46.672 --> 31:49.006
Who are you?

31:49.008 --> 31:50.540
Why are you here?

31:50.542 --> 31:53.677
Yeah, i was afraid those
questions might come up.

31:53.679 --> 31:55.112
They're not
corporate guard.

31:55.113 --> 31:56.546
They could be
hrothgar's people.

[man] did
hrothgar send you?

31:59.351 --> 32:01.251
Maybe?

32:03.289 --> 32:06.156
We didn't come
here to hurt anyone.

32:06.158 --> 32:07.457
Or get hurt.

32:07.459 --> 32:10.027
Especially that
last part.

32:10.029 --> 32:13.497
So why don't we just
lower our weapons...

32:19.571 --> 32:25.709
All of us.

32:25.711 --> 32:28.412
You say your ship
was attacked?

32:28.414 --> 32:29.613
Well, we're
not exactly--

32:29.615 --> 32:31.148
Raiders.

32:31.150 --> 32:34.017
Came at us out of nowhere,
disabled our engines,

32:34.019 --> 32:36.553
Looted our ship,
left us for dead.

32:36.555 --> 32:38.288
You're lucky
to be alive.

32:38.290 --> 32:41.425
Wouldn't be if we hadn't managed
to restore life-support.

32:41.427 --> 32:44.227
With nav systems down, we
were flying blind we got lucky

32:44.229 --> 32:47.698
Picked up your settlement
on our long-range scanners.

32:47.700 --> 32:50.434
Wow, well, you're
welcome to re-supply,

32:50.436 --> 32:52.469
And help yourselves to
whatever you need.

32:52.471 --> 32:55.305
But then you
best be off.

32:55.307 --> 32:56.640
Why's that?

32:56.642 --> 32:59.443
We're expecting trouble.

32:59.445 --> 33:01.078
This is an
independent colony.

33:01.080 --> 33:03.714
We pull enough tarium out
of the ground to get by,

33:03.716 --> 33:07.718
But we've never been of interest
to any of the big multi-corps.

33:07.720 --> 33:09.453
That is, until now.

33:09.455 --> 33:10.754
You hit a big strike?

33:10.756 --> 33:13.390
It was a couple of ferrous
corporation geologists.

33:13.392 --> 33:15.325
Surveying the
nearby asteroid belt.

33:15.327 --> 33:17.294
Apparently they
found the mother lode.

33:17.296 --> 33:19.296
But without a hab-1
planet in the vicinity

33:19.298 --> 33:21.198
It would be too
expensive to extract.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.233
They need a place to
house the miners,

33:23.235 --> 33:25.669
Grow food,
source fresh water.

33:25.671 --> 33:27.437
Some place like here?

33:27.439 --> 33:29.072
It's a big planet.

33:29.073 --> 33:30.706
It's not big enough so far
as they're concerned.

33:30.709 --> 33:34.177
The multi-corps don't
share planetary resources.

33:34.179 --> 33:35.579
It minimizes the
risk of outsiders

33:35.581 --> 33:37.714
Interfering with
their operations.

33:37.716 --> 33:40.717
As long we work this claim,
we have legal title.

33:40.719 --> 33:42.319
But if we were
to leave,

33:42.321 --> 33:44.588
Or if something should
happen to us...

33:44.590 --> 33:46.456
Well, you get
the idea.

33:46.458 --> 33:50.160
So that's why you wanna be long
gone before the raza get here.

33:50.162 --> 33:51.795
The raza?

33:51.796 --> 33:53.429
They work as enforcers
for the multi-corps.

33:53.432 --> 33:56.666
They clean up loose ends,
trouble spots--like us.

33:56.668 --> 34:01.038
They're aliens, they're
half-man, half-reptile,

34:01.040 --> 34:03.240
And i've heard that they're
over seven feet tall,

34:03.242 --> 34:05.442
And they have skin
that burns to the--

34:05.444 --> 34:08.045
The fact is no one really
knows what they are,

34:08.047 --> 34:10.514
Because no one's ever survived
an encounter with them.

34:10.516 --> 34:19.256
¶

34:21.827 --> 34:24.661
[one] if these raza really are
as dangerous as you say,

34:24.663 --> 34:26.063
Why don't you
just leave?

34:26.065 --> 34:28.298
[man] you don't
get to a place like this

34:28.300 --> 34:30.100
Unless you've already
run out of options.

34:30.102 --> 34:32.302
[girl] well, and this
claim is all we have,

34:32.304 --> 34:33.703
We're going to
fight for it.

34:33.705 --> 34:36.306
Aren't you a little young
to be doing any fighting?

34:36.308 --> 34:38.742
I'm old enough to wanna protect
my friends and family.

34:38.744 --> 34:41.778
[one] no offense, but it doesn't
seem to me like you've got

34:41.780 --> 34:43.513
The manpower
or the firepower.

34:43.515 --> 34:45.515
We gathered together the
last of our funds,

34:45.517 --> 34:49.219
Sent out one of our people
to score a shipment of arms

34:49.221 --> 34:51.221
The real thing, like the
weapons you carry.

34:51.223 --> 34:53.523
Enough for every man and
woman on this settlement.

34:53.525 --> 34:56.460
A shipment?

34:56.462 --> 34:58.361
When is it supposed
to get here?

34:58.363 --> 34:59.262
Any day now.

34:59.264 --> 35:00.981
If it arrives
in time,

35:00.982 --> 35:02.699
We'll give the raza more
than they can handle,

35:02.701 --> 35:04.801
Make ferrous corp reconsider.

35:04.803 --> 35:08.105
Well... Good luck
with that, thanks.

35:14.279 --> 35:20.183
[one] that pendant, does it
hold any special significance?

35:20.185 --> 35:22.185
Hrothgar gave this
to me before he left.

35:22.187 --> 35:24.855
He said it symbolized freedom
in the face of oppression

35:24.857 --> 35:27.657
And that when his people
people arrived we'd be able to

35:27.659 --> 35:31.862
Recognize them cause they too
would have this mark.

35:31.864 --> 35:34.498
Thanks.

35:34.500 --> 35:47.144
¶

35:53.318 --> 35:56.653
[one] this isn't right.

35:56.655 --> 35:59.256
Am i the only person who
heard what they said?

35:59.258 --> 36:00.891
A shipment of arms?

36:00.892 --> 36:02.525
Obviously we were meant
to help these people.

36:02.528 --> 36:04.628
You don't know that.

36:04.629 --> 36:06.729
And the fact that we have a
cargo hold full of weapons,

36:06.732 --> 36:08.254
That's a coincidence?

36:08.255 --> 36:09.777
You're forgetting one
important detail,

36:09.778 --> 36:11.300
The scary lizard people
that are on their way

36:11.303 --> 36:14.171
To this planet to
destroy everything!

36:14.173 --> 36:16.840
I'm guessing you don't wanna
be there when they show up.

36:16.842 --> 36:20.510
Okay, i admit,
that part sounded bad.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.212
Let's table this
discussion until

36:22.214 --> 36:24.548
We're back on the
ship, alright?

36:26.818 --> 36:41.198
¶

36:41.200 --> 36:43.733
The android said
that console was fried.

36:43.735 --> 36:46.203
You really think you
know what you're doing?

36:46.205 --> 36:48.605
Well, it's like you
with the controls,

36:48.607 --> 36:51.608
Or four with
his swords.

36:51.610 --> 36:56.346
For me, it's wires,
circuits, fuses.

36:56.348 --> 37:00.617
I don't know why, but it
just kinda makes sense to me.

37:00.619 --> 37:03.620
Not like all the
other stuff.

37:03.622 --> 37:06.623
What other stuff?

37:06.625 --> 37:11.595
I see things,
in my head.

37:11.597 --> 37:16.866
Like, while i was
sleeping, i saw a dream.

37:16.868 --> 37:19.603
Oh yeah?

37:19.605 --> 37:23.540
I was walking on the
beach with my little brother.

37:23.542 --> 37:26.576
He was crying because
he'd gotten lost,

37:26.578 --> 37:28.678
But i found
him and i was

37:28.680 --> 37:30.880
Was bringing him
back to the palace.

37:30.882 --> 37:32.616
The palace?

37:32.618 --> 37:35.619
That sounds like a
nice place to live.

37:35.621 --> 37:38.355
It was.

37:38.357 --> 37:42.626
Until they murdered my
father, and then came for me.

37:42.628 --> 37:44.894
But i was too
much for them.

37:44.896 --> 37:48.031
And even though i
could've killed them, i didn't.

37:48.033 --> 37:49.633
I just carved out
their eyes

37:49.635 --> 37:51.801
And left them for my
step mother to find.

37:51.803 --> 37:53.403
Bitch.

37:55.874 --> 37:57.874
I hope they're bringing
back some real food.

37:57.876 --> 38:01.344
I'm starving.

38:01.346 --> 38:05.615
You... You carved
out their eyes?

38:05.617 --> 38:08.885
Well, it was me
in the dream,

38:08.887 --> 38:14.691
But it wasn't really me
because it wasn't my dream.

38:14.693 --> 38:18.728
Who's dream was it?

38:18.730 --> 38:21.631
I dunno.

38:21.633 --> 38:23.867
But it was somebody's.

38:23.869 --> 38:31.908
¶

38:31.910 --> 38:34.611
I'm telling you, we're supposed
to be helping these people.

38:34.613 --> 38:35.979
The matching
pendants?

38:35.981 --> 38:37.881
It can't be a
coincidence.

38:37.882 --> 38:39.782
All i'm saying is even
if we're supposed to be

38:39.785 --> 38:41.384
Helping these people,
which i doubt,

38:41.386 --> 38:42.786
Doesn't mean
we're gonna do it.

38:42.788 --> 38:44.788
We don't even know
what happened to us,

38:44.790 --> 38:47.023
Or how we're going to
get our memories back.

38:47.025 --> 38:49.025
And those weapons would
fetch a very good

38:49.027 --> 38:50.427
Price on the
open market.

38:50.429 --> 38:52.462
The money would
go a long way--

38:52.464 --> 38:53.663
Except they're
already paid for!

38:53.665 --> 38:54.898
They belong to
the miners.

38:54.900 --> 38:56.900
Don't matter if they
belong to the miners.

38:56.902 --> 38:58.101
They're in
our cargo hold!

38:58.103 --> 38:59.920
They belong
to us, now!

38:59.921 --> 39:01.738
Those people will die
if we don't help them.

39:01.740 --> 39:03.340
They're already dead.

39:06.445 --> 39:09.045
He doesn't say much but when
he does, it makes sense.

39:09.047 --> 39:12.515
If their enemy is even half
as powerful as they believe,

39:12.517 --> 39:14.618
Then they're doomed.

39:14.619 --> 39:16.720
The least we can do is
give them a fighting chance.

39:16.722 --> 39:19.889
I'm pretty sure the
least we can do is nothing.

39:19.891 --> 39:22.625
Which, for the record, is
what i'm suggesting we do.

39:22.627 --> 39:23.626
Alright.

39:23.628 --> 39:25.028
Let's put it
to a vote.

39:25.030 --> 39:28.031
Fine.

39:28.032 --> 39:31.033
I vote that we keep the weapons,
we sell them, take what we make

39:31.036 --> 39:34.371
To stay alive, and find out what
the hell happened to us.

39:34.373 --> 39:35.638
Agreed.

39:35.640 --> 39:38.641
I think we do what we
know we came here to do,

39:38.643 --> 39:41.911
Complete the delivery.

39:41.913 --> 39:43.646
He's right.

39:43.648 --> 39:45.548
I say we help
those people.

39:45.550 --> 39:46.833
Thank you.

39:46.834 --> 39:48.117
Yeah me too, i want
to help those people.

39:48.120 --> 39:49.386
Wait a minute,
she can't vote.

39:49.388 --> 39:50.920
Why not?!

39:50.922 --> 39:51.921
Cause you're a kid.

39:51.923 --> 39:53.523
She's a member
of this crew.

39:53.525 --> 39:55.925
Who's a kid! What are
you like 15 years old?

39:55.927 --> 39:57.894
Do we really have
to have a vote

39:57.896 --> 40:01.631
To decide if
she gets to vote?

40:01.633 --> 40:03.032
I vote against
her voting.

40:07.773 --> 40:10.707
Come on, throw
up with me.

40:15.947 --> 40:17.781
Fine, three to two.

40:17.783 --> 40:20.150
What do you say,
boss lady?

40:20.152 --> 40:23.019
Set half the
crates aside.

40:23.021 --> 40:24.954
The rest go down
to the surface.

40:25.524 --> 40:32.662
¶

40:32.664 --> 40:36.065
Clean up your
tray, pretty boy.

40:41.039 --> 40:42.872
Make sure to lift
with the back

40:42.874 --> 40:44.474
Helps take pressure
off the knees.

40:44.476 --> 40:46.876
You know what would take
the pressure off my knees?

40:46.878 --> 40:48.745
You helping out.

40:48.746 --> 40:50.613
Yeah see, i think that'd
be kinda hypocritical

40:50.615 --> 40:52.782
Given the way i
voted and all.

40:52.784 --> 40:55.001
Yeah, i wouldn't worry.

40:55.002 --> 40:57.219
I don't think it'd be possible
for us to think any less of you.

40:57.222 --> 40:58.221
Well, you never know.

40:58.223 --> 41:00.040
I might surprise you.

41:00.041 --> 41:01.858
Alright i think that's
it, we're good to go.

41:12.204 --> 41:13.837
Who's that?

41:13.839 --> 41:15.205
[android] i don't know.

41:15.207 --> 41:16.973
The file is corrupt.

41:16.975 --> 41:18.975
This has been a difficult
and tedious process.

41:18.977 --> 41:21.911
However, i have managed to
recover a sizable data cache.

41:21.913 --> 41:24.113
Let's see it.

41:27.719 --> 41:30.019
[two] i need everyone
on the bridge, now.

41:30.021 --> 41:31.087
What's the matter?

41:31.089 --> 41:32.589
[two] just get up here.

41:41.566 --> 41:43.616
What's going on?

41:43.617 --> 41:45.667
The android managed to
recover a significant amount

41:45.670 --> 41:47.871
Of data related to this
ship and its crew.

41:47.873 --> 41:49.506
Well that's good.

41:49.508 --> 41:50.740
Isn't it?

41:50.742 --> 41:56.846
Marcus boone: Murder,
assault, kidnapping, piracy.

41:59.251 --> 42:05.255
Griffin jones: Murder,
assault, smuggling.

42:07.092 --> 42:15.031
Jace corso: Murder, assault,
kidnapping, trafficking, theft.

42:15.634 --> 42:21.237
Ryo tetsudo: Murder,
assault, piracy.

42:21.673 --> 42:28.578
Portia lin: Murder, assault,
arson, theft, piracy.

42:33.218 --> 42:36.319
Turns out the raza
aren't a race of aliens.

42:36.321 --> 42:39.255
"the raza" is the
name of this ship.

42:39.257 --> 42:41.257
We're not here to
help these people.

42:41.259 --> 42:43.960
We're here to
kill them.
