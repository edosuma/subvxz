00:24.958 --> 00:28.712
Realising that one could time travel
within his own lifetime,

00:28.712 --> 00:32.173
Dr Sam Beckett stepped into
the Quantum Leap Accelerator

00:32.173 --> 00:34.217
(and vanished.)

00:38.763 --> 00:41.516
He awoke to find himself trapped
in the past,

00:41.516 --> 00:44.769
facing mirror images
that were not his own.

00:44.769 --> 00:49.691
And driven by an unknown force
to change history for the better.

00:49.691 --> 00:54.863
His only guide on this journey is Al,
an observer from his own time,

00:54.863 --> 00:59.617
who appears in the form of a hologram
that only Sam can see and hear.

00:59.617 --> 01:03.955
And so Dr Beckett finds himself
leaping from life to life,

01:03.955 --> 01:06.833
striving to put right
what once went wrong

01:06.833 --> 01:12.172
and hoping each time that
his next leap will be the leap home.

01:23.058 --> 01:27.479
Quantum leaping through time,
I found myself in some tight spots.

01:27.479 --> 01:29.939
But this was definitely
the tightest.

01:32.192 --> 01:36.404
And now...
for the Sword of Doom!

01:36.404 --> 01:38.281
Doom?

01:39.657 --> 01:45.080
Ladies and gentlemen,
The Great Spontini!

01:52.128 --> 01:53.963
Oh, boy.

03:08.663 --> 03:10.790
(MILD APPLAUSE)

03:10.790 --> 03:12.834
(DRUM ROLL)

03:18.872 --> 03:22.542
Harry, the saw.
Oh. The saw.

03:32.385 --> 03:34.804
Harry! What are you doing?

03:39.351 --> 03:41.478
The head.

03:41.478 --> 03:43.480
Turn me round.

03:43.480 --> 03:45.857
Turn around and...

03:55.033 --> 03:57.077
Turn the table around.

03:58.453 --> 04:00.580
Turning the table.

04:00.580 --> 04:03.458
Still turning the table.

04:04.751 --> 04:06.920
And...stop.

04:06.920 --> 04:08.922
Harry, the saw.
The saw.

04:11.132 --> 04:13.176
Oh!

04:14.636 --> 04:16.805
(SCREAMS)

04:16.805 --> 04:18.890
Do you have to make sounds
like that?

04:20.225 --> 04:22.435
Oh!

04:22.435 --> 04:24.479
Oh! (SCREAMS)

04:25.689 --> 04:27.857
Ow!

04:27.857 --> 04:29.734
OK?
Put the dividers in.

04:29.734 --> 04:31.778
She's OK, folks.

04:33.113 --> 04:35.323
Here are the dividers.

04:35.323 --> 04:37.701
Thank you.

04:37.701 --> 04:40.120
And...the first divider is...in.

04:40.120 --> 04:43.915
And now comes the second divide

04:45.041 --> 04:47.085
Pull my head.

04:53.091 --> 04:57.846
And now...I will attempt to -
Open the doors! - open the doors!

04:57.846 --> 05:00.265
The doors... Yes.

05:02.225 --> 05:04.310
Ha, ha, ha! And...

05:05.562 --> 05:07.689
..aha!

05:07.689 --> 05:10.400
And now I will...

05:11.693 --> 05:13.695
Push me apart!
..push her apart.

05:23.038 --> 05:26.916
And now I will put it back together.

05:26.916 --> 05:30.003
There we go.

05:30.003 --> 05:32.130
Her feet are moving! Wow!

05:32.130 --> 05:34.299
Closing the doors.

05:34.299 --> 05:36.343
There we go.

05:37.510 --> 05:39.637
Closing the doors.

05:39.637 --> 05:41.765
Turning the table.

05:43.767 --> 05:45.810
(MURMURING AMONGST AUDIENCE)

05:47.854 --> 05:50.940
And...the, uh...

05:50.940 --> 05:54.235
What do you call them?
The dividers out.

06:15.048 --> 06:17.550
(Go easy.)
Thanks.

06:20.512 --> 06:22.722
That was The Great Spontini!

06:22.722 --> 06:24.891
What was that?

06:24.891 --> 06:28.687
I'm not sure.
It was Phoenix all over again.

06:28.687 --> 06:31.398
You'd better not be getting
that weird flu.

06:32.524 --> 06:34.567
Here, hold these swords.

06:36.486 --> 06:38.571
Well, you don't have a fever.

06:39.781 --> 06:41.908
Come on. Let's go.

06:43.243 --> 06:45.537
Thank God we're in Oakland.

06:45.537 --> 06:47.747
We'd never get away with that
in Vegas.

06:48.873 --> 06:54.337
How's your stomach? Uh...fine.
I'm feeling a lot better...now.

06:54.337 --> 06:58.341
OK, because we've really got to nail
that Bill Bixby audition Thursday.

06:58.341 --> 07:00.510
We're auditioning
for The Incredible Hulk?

07:00.510 --> 07:05.306
Harry, I don't think a great actor
like Bill Bixby -

07:05.306 --> 07:09.019
- and magician - is going to play
a green comic book character.

07:09.019 --> 07:11.896
Wait, The Magician -
Bill Bixby's TV show.

07:11.896 --> 07:16.651
Starring The Great Spontini
and his Table of Death.

07:17.736 --> 07:20.196
Table... Table of Death?

07:20.196 --> 07:25.326
Worth...$3,500 if we get on!

07:25.326 --> 07:28.038
And ten grand if we win
for greatest illusion.

07:28.038 --> 07:29.956
With that money in the kitty,

07:29.956 --> 07:32.542
we'll have the hottest magic shop
on the west coast!

07:35.670 --> 07:38.923
This time, we'll have all the magic
on our side!

07:44.054 --> 07:46.181
Come on.

07:46.181 --> 07:48.933
Time for my quick change routine.

07:48.933 --> 07:51.102
Just give me a minute, OK?
OK.

08:08.661 --> 08:10.705
Eek!

08:25.095 --> 08:27.138
Pah!

08:43.738 --> 08:45.782
(ITEMS RATTLE)

08:56.584 --> 09:00.630
Hmm. Let me guess.
You're a kleptomaniac.

09:02.757 --> 09:05.218
No, no, Al. I'm a...

09:05.218 --> 09:07.595
I'm a magician.

09:07.595 --> 09:09.764
I'm sorry I missed your act.

09:09.764 --> 09:12.976
But...I caught a better one
next door.

09:12.976 --> 09:15.186
Let me guess, women's dressing room?

09:15.186 --> 09:18.398
Take pity on me, Sam.
I haven't been myself lately.

09:18.398 --> 09:21.401
Tina's been away for a couple
of weeks visiting her mother.

09:21.401 --> 09:24.988
And...I do have my needs, you know?

09:26.031 --> 09:28.408
God forbid you should have two weeks'
downtime.

09:28.408 --> 09:30.493
Yeah, well, I mean...
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

09:31.953 --> 09:34.831
Uh...come in.

09:36.833 --> 09:39.419
It's Elaine from next door!

09:40.628 --> 09:44.591
And she's got the cutest little
butterfly tattoo and it's right -

09:44.591 --> 09:47.927
It... Oh, she seems to like you
a lot, Sam.

09:49.054 --> 09:52.307
I begged my agent for three months

09:52.307 --> 09:54.392
to get us booked at the same place.

09:56.019 --> 09:58.438
A four-week run together.

09:59.564 --> 10:01.608
It'll be heaven, baby!

10:03.151 --> 10:05.153
Mmm!
Go for it!

10:07.238 --> 10:09.282
You're still thinking about her.

10:10.533 --> 10:12.827
Who?
What difference does it make?!

10:12.827 --> 10:14.996
Don't play dumb with me, Harry.

10:14.996 --> 10:17.374
You just can't get her out of your
head, can you?

10:17.374 --> 10:21.419
Well, these things, they take time.
Three years? That's long enough.

10:21.419 --> 10:24.756
You hurt her feelings, Sam.
Now beg her forgiveness. What?

10:24.756 --> 10:27.133
I said, "that's long enough".

10:27.133 --> 10:29.469
I can't compete with Maggie's memory.

10:29.469 --> 10:31.805
Say you're sorry and...make up
to her.

10:31.805 --> 10:33.932
I'm...

10:33.932 --> 10:36.017
I'm sorry...Elaine.

10:36.017 --> 10:38.186
You mean it?

10:38.186 --> 10:40.647
Because I could help you
forget her.

10:40.647 --> 10:42.857
If you'd just let me try.

10:44.192 --> 10:48.029
There you go, kid.
Now you're back on the burner.

10:48.029 --> 10:50.073
Harry?

10:51.241 --> 10:53.284
Mom?

10:54.619 --> 10:56.621
Al?
Deny everything.

10:57.872 --> 11:01.001
So Mommy Dearest comes back?
You could have at least told me.

11:01.001 --> 11:03.503
Well, I didn't really...

11:04.713 --> 11:08.591
He's been waiting for you like a dog
by the door, honey.

11:11.428 --> 11:14.055
I guess I should have knocked
a little louder, huh?

11:14.055 --> 11:17.308
Well, I, uh... I...

11:17.308 --> 11:20.437
This is Maggie.
Hi, uh...Maggie.

11:23.440 --> 11:25.483
Hi, baby.

11:26.693 --> 11:29.320
You have got so big.

11:30.363 --> 11:33.158
She ran out on Harry and the kid
three years ago.

11:33.158 --> 11:35.368
I've missed you so...

11:35.368 --> 11:38.330
much.
I suppose that's for me?

11:38.330 --> 11:41.124
Oh. Yes. It is.

11:42.459 --> 11:44.502
I don't know if it's quite right.

11:45.837 --> 11:49.257
You missed me when I was this size.
A lot changes in three years.

11:49.257 --> 11:51.426
I'll tell you what I'm going to do.

11:51.426 --> 11:55.096
I'll take you shopping and you can
go pick out a larger size, OK?

11:57.474 --> 12:00.101
Hi. Steve Slater.
Nice to meet you, Harry.

12:00.101 --> 12:02.520
Caught the end of your act.
Really enjoyed it.

12:02.520 --> 12:04.564
Oh, well, thanks.

12:04.564 --> 12:07.984
Yeah, you were really great with all
that illusion stuff. You're good.

12:07.984 --> 12:10.028
Could never top your
disappearing act.

12:11.196 --> 12:13.239
Where are you going?

12:17.243 --> 12:19.329
I've got to feed the rabbits.

12:21.581 --> 12:24.209
We knew this would be tough.
It'll take a little time.

12:24.209 --> 12:28.338
Talk to him - I can't find out why
she came back after three years.

12:29.422 --> 12:32.008
Harry? I want a divorce.

12:32.008 --> 12:34.219
Bingo!
Divorce?

12:34.219 --> 12:38.056
Margaret and I are engaged. We'd
like to get the paperwork moving.

12:38.056 --> 12:40.308
Steve's also my attorney.

12:40.308 --> 12:42.519
Watch your wallet, Sam.
Here it comes.

12:42.519 --> 12:45.689
Harry, I want to make this as easy
as I possibly can. Trust me.

12:45.689 --> 12:47.899
I don't want it to get blown out
of proportion.

12:47.899 --> 12:51.403
Blown... My guess is that Steve here
is providing the plutonium.

12:51.403 --> 12:53.530
Well... Um... Couldn't...

12:53.530 --> 12:56.366
Couldn't we talk about this alone?

12:56.366 --> 12:58.618
I think we said it all
three years ago.

13:00.495 --> 13:02.622
Nothing has changed, Harry.

13:02.622 --> 13:04.791
Well, you're here.

13:04.791 --> 13:08.795
And...we don't need a lawyer
to talk.

13:08.795 --> 13:11.631
We'll talk about it tomorrow
in Judge Mulhern's chambers.

13:11.631 --> 13:13.675
County Courthouse, two o'clock.

13:14.843 --> 13:16.970
It's just a formality, Harry.

13:16.970 --> 13:19.014
Come on.

13:22.976 --> 13:25.228
I don't like that guy, Sam.

13:25.228 --> 13:28.148
He reminds me of my second wife's
divorce attorney.

13:28.148 --> 13:30.692
Cost me every nickel I had.

13:30.692 --> 13:34.654
And according to Ziggy, Harry spends
his life savings on attorney's fees.

13:34.654 --> 13:36.698
Yeah?

13:38.283 --> 13:40.368
I think I'm here to reunite
this family.

13:40.368 --> 13:42.537
What makes you think that?

13:42.537 --> 13:46.166
Well, you heard Elaine. Spontini
never stopped loving Maggie

13:46.166 --> 13:49.085
and...and I think she still
loves him.

13:49.085 --> 13:51.254
I mean, you can see it in her eyes.

13:51.254 --> 13:54.799
She left him and the kids, went to
school, got a real estate licence,

13:54.799 --> 13:58.261
started a whole new life. But she
came back. To get a divorce!

13:58.261 --> 14:00.764
I think she came back
because she still loves him.

14:02.057 --> 14:04.517
We are here to review the case
of Harry Spontini

14:04.517 --> 14:06.936
and his estranged wife
Margaret Spontini.

14:06.936 --> 14:10.440
Mr Spontini,
as I see no counsel present,

14:10.440 --> 14:13.360
I assume you've chosen to represent
yourself in this matter?

14:14.361 --> 14:16.905
Uh...yes, your Honour.

14:16.905 --> 14:20.283
And I'm sure that Mrs Spontini
and I...

14:21.743 --> 14:24.704
..can work out a solution without
taking up your time if -

14:24.704 --> 14:26.998
Guard shark here.

14:26.998 --> 14:30.877
- if her counsel would just allow us
a few moments alone to talk.

14:30.877 --> 14:33.755
Your Honour, my client and I
are prepared to waive our rights

14:33.755 --> 14:35.674
to spousal support in this matter.

14:35.674 --> 14:37.926
This is not about a divorce.

14:37.926 --> 14:41.012
However, we do believe Harry
Spontini to be an unfit parent

14:41.012 --> 14:43.348
and that Margaret Spontini
should be given

14:43.348 --> 14:46.643
sole legal and physical custody
of the minor, Jamie Spontini.

14:46.643 --> 14:48.895
See? She's after Jamie.

14:57.879 --> 15:00.507
This was supposed to be about
a divorce, not a custody hearing.

15:00.507 --> 15:04.010
You Honour, I'd like to show examples
of unacceptable living conditions

15:04.010 --> 15:05.971
that Mr Spontini has subjected

15:05.971 --> 15:08.557
his 12-year-old daughter to
over the last few years.

15:08.557 --> 15:12.352
These photos demonstrate the need for
temporary placement of the child

15:12.352 --> 15:15.021
with Mrs Spontini's custody
as soon as possible.

15:15.021 --> 15:18.066
Photos? Yeah, the shark hired a dick
to follow you.

15:18.066 --> 15:20.110
I warned you.
I don't want to hear it.

15:20.110 --> 15:22.195
I'm afraid you'll have to,
Mr Spontini.

15:22.195 --> 15:24.322
May I see those, counsellor?

15:24.322 --> 15:26.491
Custody hearings are the worst.

15:26.491 --> 15:30.287
I remember my third... fourth...
third wife, Sharon and I,

15:30.287 --> 15:32.664
we fought for over eight months
over Chester.

15:34.124 --> 15:36.793
(You have a son?)
Dog.

15:36.793 --> 15:39.296
He was a good dog. 
And she got him.

15:39.296 --> 15:42.507
I tell you, in a family court,
women have all the power.

15:42.507 --> 15:44.676
Mr Spontini?

15:44.676 --> 15:48.722
How many residences have you had
in the last, oh, five years?

15:48.722 --> 15:51.766
You live in a trailer.
We have one residence.

15:51.766 --> 15:55.061
A one-bedroom mobile home that
changes locations from week to week

15:55.061 --> 15:57.355
can't be considered
a suitable residence.

15:57.355 --> 15:59.316
My work forces me to live
on the road

15:59.316 --> 16:01.776
and I feel that it's better for Jamie
- my daughter -

16:01.776 --> 16:04.988
if she's with me and I don't leave
her. That's good, Sam.

16:04.988 --> 16:07.115
Do you travel a lot or a little?

16:07.115 --> 16:10.493
Well... Let's see. 30 weeks
out of the year. Lie a little.

16:10.493 --> 16:13.163
I'm employed about 30 weeks
out of the year.

16:13.163 --> 16:15.206
Your daughter doesn't have
her own room?

16:16.416 --> 16:18.627
She has a sleeping area.

16:18.627 --> 16:21.588
But she's happy!
But she's a very happy

16:21.588 --> 16:23.882
and well-adjusted young girl,
Mr Slater.

16:23.882 --> 16:26.176
Well, I'm sure you feel that way,
Mr Spontini

16:26.176 --> 16:29.471
but do you think it's appropriate
for a maturing young girl

16:29.471 --> 16:31.389
to share a common sleeping area?

16:31.389 --> 16:34.059
Well, uh...no.

16:34.059 --> 16:37.270
But we're trying to buy a business

16:37.270 --> 16:39.314
that will enable us
to settle into the area.

16:39.314 --> 16:41.775
A magic shop?
Yes, that's correct.

16:41.775 --> 16:44.402
Mrs Spontini, were you aware
of this business purchase?

16:45.820 --> 16:48.031
Yes, I was.

16:48.031 --> 16:51.076
How many years has this purchase
been a consideration?

16:51.076 --> 16:55.497
Um... Well, since I first met
my husband in 61.

16:56.957 --> 16:59.084
He's working her, Sam.

16:59.084 --> 17:01.461
Your Honour...

17:01.461 --> 17:05.048
at this time, we are very close
to having a downpayment.

17:05.048 --> 17:08.551
That's nice, Harry, but this hearing
is not about your future situation,

17:08.551 --> 17:10.512
it's about Jamie's present.

17:10.512 --> 17:14.391
How many schools has Jamie attended
in the last, say, two years?

17:14.391 --> 17:17.602
Well, let me think. Um...

17:18.645 --> 17:20.814
Come on! Don't let me down now.

17:20.814 --> 17:24.067
Mr Spontini?
Uh... Well, your Honour,

17:24.067 --> 17:26.694
I would probably...
I would have to check my records.

17:26.694 --> 17:28.947
Um... Battery looks good.
Because...

17:28.947 --> 17:31.658
I, uh -
I'll slug you!

17:31.658 --> 17:33.910
- why are you doing this?

17:33.910 --> 17:36.621
Something perhaps as simple
as a birthday.

17:38.290 --> 17:40.333
Ah! Hang on.

17:41.626 --> 17:44.671
Well, it's 74 now.
She was born in 1962.

17:44.671 --> 17:46.673
Perhaps you can recall a date?

17:46.673 --> 17:48.717
A date...

17:50.343 --> 17:52.804
Oh, here!

17:52.804 --> 17:55.432
She attended Tetford School for...
No!

17:55.432 --> 17:57.475
Oh, no!

17:58.643 --> 18:01.104
Uh-oh. I think I killed it, Sam.

18:01.104 --> 18:03.189
Um...

18:04.399 --> 18:08.153
I have... I have never really been
very good with dates.

18:08.153 --> 18:13.617
Um... And birthdays, sometimes I have
trouble remembering my own birthday.

18:13.617 --> 18:18.663
Um...but whatever the day...was,

18:18.663 --> 18:21.875
I just think it's important to note
that...

18:21.875 --> 18:24.044
I was there.

18:24.044 --> 18:27.214
You work as a magician?
Yeah, yeah, you saw me last night.

18:27.214 --> 18:29.799
Who takes care of your daughte
while you're working?

18:29.799 --> 18:31.927
Well, she's my assistant.

18:31.927 --> 18:34.054
Your 12-year-old daughter
works with you?

18:34.054 --> 18:36.097
The third photo
is the Blue Mamba Club,

18:36.097 --> 18:39.059
where Mr Spontini and his daughter
are currently employed.

18:39.059 --> 18:41.937
Margaret Spontini
and I visited the club last night.

18:41.937 --> 18:44.231
I want you to note the living
conditions,

18:44.231 --> 18:48.318
which this child is being subjected
to, both physically and emotionally.

18:50.487 --> 18:53.281
Mr Spontini,
would you care to respond?

18:53.281 --> 18:55.909
Uh -
She ran out on Jamie.

18:57.285 --> 18:59.371
Your Honour...

19:00.872 --> 19:04.251
..I think that Har - that I...
that I have...

19:05.502 --> 19:07.671
..been a good father to Jamie.

19:07.671 --> 19:11.925
I love her and I've been there
for her every day

19:11.925 --> 19:14.678
and I would hope that that would
count for something.

19:15.804 --> 19:19.224
Now, maybe I'm not very good
with the details...

19:19.224 --> 19:21.476
and things like that, but...

19:22.936 --> 19:24.980
..I just...

19:27.440 --> 19:29.693
..I didn't walk out on my daughter.

19:29.693 --> 19:31.861
Hey, I didn't have a choice!

19:31.861 --> 19:35.031
I am trying to make a better life
for myself

19:35.031 --> 19:37.701
and I'm trying to make one
for Jamie too.

19:37.701 --> 19:40.704
Fight for her, Sam! Don't
you think that's what I'm doing?

19:40.704 --> 19:42.872
I understand, Mr Spontini.

19:42.872 --> 19:48.086
However, considering the fact that
you have no permanent residence

19:48.086 --> 19:50.422
or steady employment,
I have no choice

19:50.422 --> 19:55.010
but to award temporary custody of the
minor, Jamie Spontini, to her mother.

19:55.010 --> 19:57.637
Pending a formal hearing
on the matter.

19:57.637 --> 20:00.599
Sam! Why don't we ask Jamie
what she wants?

20:00.599 --> 20:02.684
She's a minor, Mr Spontini.

20:02.684 --> 20:06.229
My client searched for two and a half
years before locating her daughter.

20:06.229 --> 20:09.858
We feel Mr Spontini may flee with
the child, given the opportunity.

20:09.858 --> 20:12.652
Oh, your Honour, please -
No, I'm not going to flinch.

20:12.652 --> 20:15.697
I swear... We believe it is
in the best interests of Jamie

20:15.697 --> 20:18.533
that her father be denied visitation
rights - Oh, no.

20:18.533 --> 20:20.660
- until a formal decision is made.

20:20.660 --> 20:22.746
I don't believe it's necessary

20:22.746 --> 20:26.041
to deny Mr Spontini access
to his daughter. Thank you.

20:26.041 --> 20:29.711
However, visitation shall be limited
to Mrs Spontini's home.

20:31.046 --> 20:34.674
Mr Spontini, I'm sorry,
but by five o'clock this afternoon,

20:34.674 --> 20:37.385
you shall deliver custody
of the minor to her mother.

20:38.553 --> 20:40.722
And Mr Spontini...

20:40.722 --> 20:44.643
I suggest you retain legal counsel
before the actual hearing.

20:49.356 --> 20:51.441
Thank you, all.

21:00.158 --> 21:02.077
Maggie -
Come on, Harry.

21:02.077 --> 21:04.996
Don't make me add reports
of physical abuse to this hearing.

21:04.996 --> 21:08.166
Steve. Please, Harry. I just want
to talk to my wife alone.

21:08.166 --> 21:10.126
She doesn't want to talk to you.
Maggie -

21:10.126 --> 21:13.964
It's best if you let Jamie be with me
for a while. You must believe that.

21:13.964 --> 21:16.424
I don't and I don't think
you do either.

21:16.424 --> 21:18.426
I want my daughter.
Come on.

21:24.349 --> 21:26.518
So, she wants a divorce?

21:26.518 --> 21:28.979
She hasn't belonged to us
since she ran away.

21:30.146 --> 21:32.190
We'll be OK.

21:32.190 --> 21:34.818
Your mother wants to take care
of you, Jamie,

21:34.818 --> 21:37.487
and the judge wants you to live
with her for a while.

21:38.655 --> 21:41.032
When?
Today at 5:00.

21:42.117 --> 21:44.119
I don't want to live with her.

21:44.119 --> 21:47.122
Now, it's only temporary
until the hearing's over.

21:47.122 --> 21:50.292
Don't I have a choice?
No. Not in this one.

21:51.751 --> 21:53.920
I'll be back here first thing
in the morning.

21:53.920 --> 21:57.257
I figured out where we are blowing
that table of death illusion.

21:57.257 --> 21:59.384
The judge says you can't come
to the club.

21:59.384 --> 22:01.511
Didn't you tell him you need me
for the act?

22:01.511 --> 22:04.222
He doesn't think that a nightclub

22:04.222 --> 22:07.434
is a good place for a young girl
to be working.

22:08.560 --> 22:11.438
Is he nuts or something?
I'm learning a trade.

22:11.438 --> 22:14.149
He wants you in a real home.

22:14.149 --> 22:17.193
That's why I'm taking you
to your mother's in two hours.

22:17.193 --> 22:20.155
We can run away. I can pack.
If we don't show up,

22:20.155 --> 22:23.116
I'll be thrown in jail and you'll
end up at your mother's anyway.

22:24.409 --> 22:26.620
Harry, don't let them take me away.

22:35.879 --> 22:37.964
It won't be for ever, OK?

22:40.926 --> 22:45.263
I'll find a way for the two of us
to be together again soon.

22:46.306 --> 22:48.391
I promise.

22:51.144 --> 22:53.813
Now, I want you to do something
for me, OK?

22:57.025 --> 23:00.195
Will you go to your mother's and
stay with her for a couple of days

23:00.195 --> 23:02.447
until I get this all
straightened out?

23:03.573 --> 23:05.659
OK?

23:06.868 --> 23:08.912
OK.

23:09.996 --> 23:11.915
On one condition.

23:12.999 --> 23:17.879
I re-rigged the shackles to open
at once. It'll be a snap.

23:21.132 --> 23:26.888
If it's such a snap, why do they
call it the Table of Death?

23:28.014 --> 23:30.100
Cos two guys have died doing it.

23:31.268 --> 23:34.396
Two guys have died?!
But you're better than them, Harry.

23:35.730 --> 23:37.774
Huh. Yeah.

23:43.572 --> 23:47.659
You have an extra 15 seconds
before it hits the final latch.

23:47.659 --> 23:51.371
Then, all 900lbs of canopy
come slamming down

23:51.371 --> 23:53.540
and splattering your guts
all over the place.

23:55.709 --> 23:59.713
Jamie, listen, there has got to be
a better way to get the magic shop.

24:00.922 --> 24:03.300
We need this to get on The Magician.

24:04.509 --> 24:06.595
Watch this.

24:08.305 --> 24:11.016
I told you it would work.
Hey, Sam, did I ever tell you

24:11.016 --> 24:14.311
that when I was in the orphanage,
they used to call me Al the Pick?

24:18.273 --> 24:21.693
Failsafe fun. 60 seconds, Harry. Go.

24:23.904 --> 24:26.406
Uh...is there any way to stop it?

24:32.621 --> 24:34.956
Gee, I'd like to do
a trick like this.

24:43.798 --> 24:45.967
What are you doing?

24:45.967 --> 24:48.011
I mean, you can pick locks
in your sleep.

24:52.766 --> 24:57.312
20 seconds. Hey, don't worry about
me, Sam. I'm having a good time.

24:58.939 --> 25:01.024
Ten seconds.

25:02.192 --> 25:05.987
What's wrong? I can't...
I can't get the feel of it.

25:05.987 --> 25:08.823
What?
I can't...

25:08.823 --> 25:10.951
(ALARM SOUNDS)

25:19.751 --> 25:21.795
I couldn't do it.

25:24.172 --> 25:26.341
You're doing this on purpose.

25:26.341 --> 25:28.510
You don't want me around anymore!

25:53.187 --> 25:55.939
Do you know how many hickeys I got
from using that stuff?

25:55.939 --> 25:59.318
I got a million hickeys.
I almost got killed back there.

25:59.318 --> 26:01.945
Hey, I was the guy in the rack.

26:01.945 --> 26:04.656
I can't do the trick. You saw.
I can not do that trick.

26:04.656 --> 26:07.242
You've got to, unless you want Harry
to lose his kid.

26:07.242 --> 26:10.162
Well, maybe...
Maybe that's for the best.

26:10.162 --> 26:12.331
But it's not.

26:12.331 --> 26:14.541
Maggie wins custody
and she marries Jaws

26:14.541 --> 26:17.294
and Jamie runs away from home
trying to find her father.

26:17.294 --> 26:19.880
She doesn't and she ends up on the
street, stealing.

26:21.131 --> 26:24.510
You can't let that kid's life
be ruined by an ego-centric lawyer

26:24.510 --> 26:28.013
and an inept woman who didn't deserve
to be her mother in the first place.

26:28.013 --> 26:30.641
Al, I'm not going to let Harry
lose his daughter, OK?

26:30.641 --> 26:34.228
Well, how you can to keep it from -
Oh, I get it.

26:35.354 --> 26:38.899
You're going to make nice-nice with
the mother? Well, it's worth a shot.

26:38.899 --> 26:41.819
I know that kind of woman, Sam.
You're wasting your time.

26:43.070 --> 26:46.240
Al, maybe if your mom thought she
had a chance, she'd have come back.

26:49.993 --> 26:53.205
Maggie made a mistake. I just want
to give her a chance to fix it.

26:53.205 --> 26:55.249
You're losing it, Harry.

26:59.837 --> 27:04.758
Oh! I think you're supposed to wear
that stuff, not drink it.

27:06.009 --> 27:10.305
Well, I had a little accident
and, uh...

27:11.598 --> 27:13.726
You ready to go?

27:13.726 --> 27:15.602
N...o.

27:16.729 --> 27:20.649
A great house. Yeah, if you want
to live with Wally and the Beaver.

27:25.029 --> 27:26.905
Hi, Jamie.
Hi.

27:28.032 --> 27:29.992
Hi.

27:31.577 --> 27:33.579
For you.
Oh, thank you.

27:35.205 --> 27:39.126
They smell like...Aqua Velva.

27:40.461 --> 27:42.504
Well...

27:44.381 --> 27:47.718
Well, do you want to come in?
Do I have a choice?

27:50.637 --> 27:54.349
You know, this is really...
It's a big change for her

27:54.349 --> 27:56.477
and maybe if I could...

27:57.936 --> 28:01.774
Sure, Harry. Come on in.
Oh, great. Great. Come on.

28:10.074 --> 28:12.868
Well, make yourselves at home.
I'll be right back, OK?

28:14.370 --> 28:16.413
OK.

28:18.248 --> 28:20.501
Just try, OK? Please?

28:20.501 --> 28:22.544
Give it a chance.

28:25.881 --> 28:29.134
Lemonade.
With water, in case it's too strong.

28:29.134 --> 28:31.178
Not too sweet.

28:33.764 --> 28:35.891
Where did Jamie go?

28:35.891 --> 28:37.935
Um...back yard.

28:40.729 --> 28:42.773
Oh, Harry.

28:43.899 --> 28:46.068
I'm sorry this is happening
the way it is.

28:46.068 --> 28:49.363
Steve thought it would be best
if I...

28:51.240 --> 28:53.617
I just wanted Jamie back.

28:54.785 --> 28:58.080
Listen, um...I'm sorry too.

28:58.080 --> 29:02.876
I... I said some things
that I wish -

29:02.876 --> 29:05.087
You didn't say anything
that wasn't true.

29:07.965 --> 29:12.928
I just want a chance to make it up
to her before it's too late.

29:12.928 --> 29:15.097
I know.

29:15.097 --> 29:17.433
And that's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

29:17.433 --> 29:19.643
This is a rough neighbourhood!

29:19.643 --> 29:21.562
Oh, my God!

29:24.440 --> 29:26.483
Jamie?

29:27.776 --> 29:29.820
(JAMIE LAUGHS)

29:32.573 --> 29:35.409
Where's your sense of humour,
Maggie?

29:35.409 --> 29:40.205
I think this is just Jamie's way
of saying...

29:40.205 --> 29:42.207
she's really glad to be here.
Come on.

29:43.375 --> 29:46.503
Why don't we say...why don't
we look at your new room, OK?

29:47.671 --> 29:49.715
My room is in our trailer
in Oakland.

29:54.219 --> 29:58.182
Wow, Maggie! You've done
a terrific job. Thank you.

29:58.182 --> 30:00.476
Yeah, not a dust bunny in sight.

30:00.476 --> 30:02.895
Hey, hey, look at this bed, huh?

30:02.895 --> 30:05.272
Come on. Isn't this great?

30:07.900 --> 30:09.943
Sarah?

30:11.528 --> 30:13.739
I thought I lost her and...

30:13.739 --> 30:16.200
And you had her all the time.

30:16.200 --> 30:18.243
Jamie, I had her...

30:19.495 --> 30:23.957
I took her because I needed
something that was a part of you.

30:25.292 --> 30:28.629
And Sarah made things a little
easier for me for a while.

30:30.798 --> 30:32.966
I like the bed.

30:32.966 --> 30:38.305
What do you say we get you unpacked
and settled in, all right?

30:38.305 --> 30:42.017
That's a great idea. Here's the
dresser. The closet's right there.

30:42.017 --> 30:44.687
Which drawer is mine?
They're all yours.

30:45.771 --> 30:48.190
I'll only be needing one.
I'm not staying long.

31:04.081 --> 31:05.999
You look really nice.

31:05.999 --> 31:07.960
Oh, that so?

31:07.960 --> 31:09.878
Thank you, Harry.

31:09.878 --> 31:12.631
You know, Maggie...

31:13.841 --> 31:17.344
..you have to admit that we had
some pretty terrific times.

31:18.721 --> 31:20.806
Really?
Yeah.

31:20.806 --> 31:22.850
Yeah. Like that, um...

31:24.184 --> 31:26.228
..that trip.

31:27.479 --> 31:29.523
Which one?

31:30.858 --> 31:33.694
Well, Virginia Beach
or New Orleans?

31:33.694 --> 31:37.114
New Orleans.
I knew that you'd say New Orleans!

31:38.907 --> 31:41.368
You were incredible that weekend,
Harry.

31:42.494 --> 31:45.372
Never been able to look at a balcony
the same way again.

31:47.458 --> 31:49.543
Balcony. Um...

31:51.378 --> 31:53.756
..well, I feel the same way.

31:57.676 --> 32:00.888
You want some brownies? They're
the kind with the marshmallows.

32:00.888 --> 32:03.015
Yeah. Remember we ate
a whole pan of these

32:03.015 --> 32:04.725
the night before Jamie was born?

32:07.644 --> 32:10.356
Ow! I just burned myself.

32:11.482 --> 32:14.693
I'll get some butter.
Here, wait, wait. Wait a second.

32:14.693 --> 32:17.112
Let me look at it. Come here.

32:18.447 --> 32:20.616
Come on, come on.

32:20.616 --> 32:24.745
Feel better? Why is it you always
know what to do, Harry?

32:30.334 --> 32:32.378
Oh, Harry...

32:51.772 --> 32:53.816
Harry...

32:55.776 --> 32:57.903
This custody battle,

32:57.903 --> 33:00.072
it's crazy.

33:00.072 --> 33:02.199
I mean -
I know.

33:02.199 --> 33:04.785
We can work these things out
by ourselves.

33:04.785 --> 33:08.205
Right? I mean, as soon as I get
the magic shop, everything -

33:08.205 --> 33:10.249
Oh? The magic shop?

33:10.249 --> 33:14.378
Then you're going to settle down
and buy a real home, right, Harry?

33:14.378 --> 33:16.797
I heard that before.
I heard it for eight years

33:16.797 --> 33:18.757
and I'm not going to hear it again.

33:18.757 --> 33:20.801
So you walked away?

33:20.801 --> 33:23.971
Do you think that I wanted
to leave my baby?

33:25.389 --> 33:28.934
God! I didn't have a choice, Harry.

33:28.934 --> 33:32.938
I couldn't sit around waiting
for all your fantasies to come true.

33:34.231 --> 33:36.400
So I left her.

33:36.400 --> 33:39.862
And I went out there and
I made it happen, Harry.

33:39.862 --> 33:44.450
Now I can give her all the things
that we always wanted to give her.

33:44.450 --> 33:47.327
(DOOR OPENING)
Nice clothes, good schools -

33:47.327 --> 33:50.372
Why don't we give her them together?
You let him inside the house?

33:51.832 --> 33:54.543
Well, not that it's any of your
business, but...

33:54.543 --> 33:57.129
I was talking to Maggie,
who is still my wife,

33:57.129 --> 33:59.715
about Jamie,
who will always be my daughter.

33:59.715 --> 34:02.676
He was just leaving, Steve.
Good. Because talking to you

34:02.676 --> 34:05.679
without your lawyer present
could jeopardise his case.

34:05.679 --> 34:09.350
A little free legal advice. I don't
want your advice. I want my family.

34:09.350 --> 34:11.226
Frankly, other than
a few signatures,

34:11.226 --> 34:13.187
your family doesn't exist.

34:13.187 --> 34:16.357
Harry, just leave.
Why don't you ask him to leave?

34:16.357 --> 34:19.610
Keep it up. I can pretty much
guarantee you no visitation rights.

34:19.610 --> 34:23.322
You can't keep me from my daughter.
Don't count on it. I always win.

34:24.656 --> 34:27.117
That's what this is about for you,
isn't it?

34:27.117 --> 34:29.286
Winning.

34:29.286 --> 34:32.414
You don't care about Maggie.
I know you don't care about Jamie.

34:32.414 --> 34:36.251
What?
Come on. Come on, stop!

34:37.835 --> 34:40.297
Huh! Smooth move, ex-lax.

34:40.297 --> 34:42.549
Look, maybe you both should leave.

34:42.549 --> 34:45.761
Come on, Maggie. I think that's
probably a good idea. Come here.

34:47.679 --> 34:49.973
See you tomorrow, sweetheart, OK?

34:57.606 --> 34:59.650
You too, Steve.

35:07.533 --> 35:10.160
Smile and enjoy it, Jamie.

35:10.160 --> 35:13.956
When I've finished with him in
court, it'll be a cold day in hell

35:13.956 --> 35:16.417
before you and your mother ever lay
eyes on him again.

35:36.520 --> 35:38.689
I don't need a babysitter.

35:38.689 --> 35:41.775
Honey, I feel bad about leaving you
on your first day home.

35:41.775 --> 35:44.028
Are you going to be OK?
No sweat.

35:44.028 --> 35:47.156
Don't you worry about a thing,
Mrs Spontini.

35:47.156 --> 35:49.616
I've been taking care of babies
all my life.

35:49.616 --> 35:52.077
I am not a baby.

35:54.329 --> 35:56.623
How about if we go shopping
later today?

35:58.792 --> 36:00.711
OK, Maggie.

36:00.711 --> 36:02.755
How about "Mom"?

36:04.298 --> 36:06.508
Oh, give me a chance, Jamie.

36:08.844 --> 36:10.804
I'm sorry, baby.

36:10.804 --> 36:13.849
I'm sorry that I can't give you back
the years I wasn't with you.

36:15.142 --> 36:17.853
But I can give us a future together.

36:19.104 --> 36:21.815
If you let me.
What about Harry?

36:22.858 --> 36:24.777
Who's going to take care of him?

36:24.777 --> 36:26.862
Harry is going to be OK.

36:28.322 --> 36:30.449
You don't understand.

36:30.449 --> 36:32.576
We know each other's thoughts.

36:33.911 --> 36:36.705
We're a team.
Well, maybe we could be a team too.

36:37.956 --> 36:40.084
And Steve?

36:40.084 --> 36:42.169
Is he part of our team?

36:43.670 --> 36:46.799
Steve loves me very, very much

36:46.799 --> 36:49.009
and he takes good care of me.

36:49.009 --> 36:51.428
And he's the reason
that you're with me again.

36:52.721 --> 36:54.807
So you've got to give him a chance
too, OK?

36:54.807 --> 36:57.184
Do you love him?
I love you.

36:58.769 --> 37:01.480
And that's all that matters to me
right now.

37:04.024 --> 37:06.527
I've got to get out of here
before I'm late, OK?

37:07.945 --> 37:09.988
Oh, baby.

37:16.662 --> 37:18.497
Bye bye.

37:51.989 --> 37:54.033
Looks like she got you again, Sam.

37:55.743 --> 37:57.911
She's a good kid, Al.

37:57.911 --> 38:00.039
I hate to see her going through
this.

38:00.039 --> 38:02.666
Yeah, divorce is always hardest
on the kids.

38:03.959 --> 38:06.128
I think I've really
messed this leap up.

38:06.128 --> 38:08.297
Haven't I?

38:08.297 --> 38:11.759
I mean, maybe... Maybe
I should have hired an attorney.

38:11.759 --> 38:15.054
No, that's how Spontini
lost everything in the first place.

38:15.054 --> 38:16.889
You're doing this right, Sam.

38:16.889 --> 38:19.475
You go into court and you just talk
from your heart

38:19.475 --> 38:21.810
and the judge has got to give you
joint custody.

38:21.810 --> 38:24.897
I've got a bad feeling about Jamie.
What kind of feeling?

38:24.897 --> 38:27.191
I don't know, I've just...
I've got a bad feeling.

38:28.567 --> 38:32.363
Well, I'll check in on Jamie
and you get ready to go to court.

38:32.363 --> 38:34.365
The last thing you want to do
is be late.

38:38.744 --> 38:41.288
Jamie! Get off of that table!

38:42.414 --> 38:44.541
Jam - This is a mistake.

38:46.126 --> 38:48.545
This is not going to work, Jamie.

38:48.545 --> 38:51.131
Ziggy says you're going to die!

38:57.532 --> 39:00.619
Isn't it true that during your
marriage to Harry Spontini,

39:00.619 --> 39:04.039
you and your child were dragged from
one slum nightclub to the next?

39:04.039 --> 39:05.999
I... I object.

39:05.999 --> 39:08.835
This is not a trial, Mr Spontini.

39:08.835 --> 39:11.671
We're only trying to establish
a few facts.

39:11.671 --> 39:15.425
Why don't you rephrase the question,
Counsellor? Yes, your Honour.

39:16.510 --> 39:19.221
Were you able to maintain any sense
of a normal home life

39:19.221 --> 39:21.139
when you were married to Mr Spontini?

39:22.933 --> 39:27.187
Well, being a...professional
magician -

39:27.187 --> 39:30.565
Yes or no?
No.

39:30.565 --> 39:34.403
When you could no longer tolerate it,
you were forced to leave. Correct?

39:34.403 --> 39:37.364
Well, I left so that I could
complete my education,

39:37.364 --> 39:39.991
get a job and provide a stable home
for my child.

39:39.991 --> 39:42.077
Something your husband
could never do.

39:43.370 --> 39:48.375
Now, Jamie, uh...just stay lying
there and don't touch anything,

39:48.375 --> 39:51.962
don't do anything and...why am I
talking when she can't hear me?

39:53.046 --> 39:55.507
I've got to get Sam.

39:55.507 --> 39:58.093
You still have no steady job or
permanent residence.

39:58.093 --> 39:59.928
Isn't that true, Mr Spontini?

40:01.430 --> 40:03.932
Uh...I can't hear you.

40:03.932 --> 40:05.892
Yes, that's correct.

40:05.892 --> 40:09.479
Yet you selfishly believe that you'd
be the best choice for custody.

40:09.479 --> 40:12.983
Look, I know that...at this time,

40:12.983 --> 40:17.029
society does not consider fathers to
be the best choice as single parents

40:17.029 --> 40:20.490
but there is no law that says that a
woman is a better parent than a man.

40:20.490 --> 40:22.743
A simple yes or no -
The important thing here

40:22.743 --> 40:24.870
is that the child's needs
are being met.

40:24.870 --> 40:27.789
Now, anybody who knows Jamie knows
that I've done just that.

40:27.789 --> 40:30.167
Sam! It's Jamie!
What about Jamie?

40:30.167 --> 40:32.669
That's what we're here
to decide, Mr Spontini.

40:32.669 --> 40:35.172
She's trying to do that
Table of Death trick. What?

40:35.172 --> 40:37.549
Mr Spontini, are you all right?

40:37.549 --> 40:40.177
If you don't do something about it,
she's going to die!

40:40.177 --> 40:42.387
Ziggy says you've got 14 minutes.

40:42.387 --> 40:45.974
I've got to go. You can't leave
in the middle of proceedings.

40:45.974 --> 40:48.435
Mr Spontini?
Mr Spontini, you sit down

40:48.435 --> 40:50.479
or I will file you
in contempt of court!

40:50.479 --> 40:53.982
I can't explain, your Honour. I have
a feeling my daughter is in trouble.

40:53.982 --> 40:56.651
Jamie? Maggie, sit down.
We've got this thing won.

40:56.651 --> 40:59.363
No! If he says she's in trouble,
I'm going.

40:59.363 --> 41:03.658
Hurry, Sam. It takes ten minutes
to get there. We've got 13 left.

41:03.658 --> 41:05.786
Harry!

41:05.786 --> 41:09.748
Harry! Harry, stop! Stop, stop!

41:11.208 --> 41:13.752
Come on. Come on, hurry up.
Where are we going?

41:13.752 --> 41:15.879
The club.
The club?

41:15.879 --> 41:19.007
Harry, why are we going to the club?
That's where Jamie is.

41:19.007 --> 41:21.593
I left her with Mrs Futrell.

41:21.593 --> 41:24.429
She's gone. Look, you're just going
to have to trust me, OK?

41:24.429 --> 41:26.681
I know that she's in danger.

41:26.681 --> 41:29.142
Well, what's she doing at the club?

41:29.142 --> 41:31.269
The Table of Death trick.

41:31.269 --> 41:33.730
She thinks that if we can do it,

41:33.730 --> 41:36.400
then we'll get on TV
and get the magic shop.

41:40.821 --> 41:42.864
Oh, great.

41:52.582 --> 41:54.668
Look out for the kid on the bike!

41:58.505 --> 42:01.133
Thanks.
I didn't do anything.

42:11.852 --> 42:13.937
Oh, no.

42:17.524 --> 42:19.609
Help!

42:20.736 --> 42:22.821
Help!

42:34.958 --> 42:39.713

Sam! Down here. Hurry up!

42:39.713 --> 42:42.257
Daddy, get me out! Hurry!

42:42.257 --> 42:45.427
No, no, you can't stop it.
With the pick!

42:45.427 --> 42:47.846
Oh, yeah.
The pick is on the floor, Sam.

42:48.930 --> 42:52.059
Now, just try and stay calm.
Steady hand. You can do it, Sam.

42:59.941 --> 43:02.152
Seven seconds. Six.

43:02.152 --> 43:04.237
Harry!

43:05.489 --> 43:07.866
Harry!
Four. Three seconds, Sam.

43:07.866 --> 43:09.910
Two. One!

43:09.910 --> 43:11.828
No!

43:14.623 --> 43:16.750
Oh, you did it, Sam.

43:16.750 --> 43:19.211
Oh, baby! Oh, baby.

43:19.211 --> 43:22.172
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

43:22.172 --> 43:24.257
Are you OK? Are you OK?
Oh, God.

43:25.342 --> 43:27.177
You Honour, Mr Spontini's actions

43:27.177 --> 43:30.097
clearly demonstrate his inability
to raise this child.

43:30.097 --> 43:32.057
You don't do anything about it!

43:32.057 --> 43:34.768
He encouraged Jamie,
for his own professional gain,

43:34.768 --> 43:38.188
to experiment with a potentially
lethal piece of equipment.

43:39.314 --> 43:43.026
We believe he should face charges
for felony child endangerment.

43:43.026 --> 43:45.153
No, he shouldn't!

43:45.153 --> 43:47.656
Your Honour, Jamie was in my care.

43:47.656 --> 43:50.617
If anybody endangered my child,
it was me.

43:50.617 --> 43:53.745
What are you saying? Look,
Jamie has been trying to tell me

43:53.745 --> 43:55.831
but I just didn't want to see it.

43:55.831 --> 43:59.209
They're too much a part of each
other, Steve. Sit down.

43:59.209 --> 44:01.253
No, it's over.

44:02.587 --> 44:06.174
I can't...
I can't take her away from you.

44:06.174 --> 44:09.386
My client is under extreme duress
due to these circumstances.

44:09.386 --> 44:13.098
You're making a big mistake! I made
a mistake three years ago, Steve,

44:13.098 --> 44:15.100
and I'm not going to make
another one.

44:15.100 --> 44:18.228
Your Honour, I would like
to withdraw my petition.

44:20.522 --> 44:23.025
Are both parties in accord?

44:23.025 --> 44:25.027
Yes.
All right!

44:26.194 --> 44:28.155
Well, this case is dismissed.

44:29.531 --> 44:32.701
I'll reinstate proceedings
for divorce first thing tomorrow.

44:32.701 --> 44:34.786
I don't think so, Steve.

44:37.164 --> 44:39.332
You've got to be kidding.

44:39.332 --> 44:43.045
You have to understand that I can't
go through my life wondering

44:43.045 --> 44:46.089
if I'm throwing something
very special away.

44:49.134 --> 44:52.471
I guess you and I have a different
definition of what is special.

44:52.471 --> 44:54.598
Yeah.

44:54.598 --> 44:57.809
Steve - Looks like you're out of
a job, butthead.

44:57.809 --> 45:00.645
My sentiments exactly, butthead.

45:04.441 --> 45:07.319
I'm really sorry I put you through
all this mess.

45:10.072 --> 45:13.200
I hope that some day,
we can be good friends again.

45:14.451 --> 45:16.495
I don't know. What do you think?

45:17.704 --> 45:20.332
And...you'll never go away again?

45:20.332 --> 45:23.710
I promise you with all my heart.

45:23.710 --> 45:26.421
I love you, Mommy.
Oh, I love you, baby!

45:27.714 --> 45:30.717
Well, Sam, looks like Maggie
makes good on her promise.

45:31.885 --> 45:34.346
She and Jamie turn out to be
a great team

45:34.346 --> 45:38.308
and Maggie finds a wonderful deal
on a little magic shop,

45:38.308 --> 45:40.435
right around the corner
from her place.

45:40.435 --> 45:42.646
(Do Harry and Maggie
end up together?)

45:42.646 --> 45:44.981
No, that's not in the cards, Sam.

45:44.981 --> 45:48.652
Well then, maybe we're just going
to have to change the cards.

45:50.070 --> 45:52.155
I promise you.

45:55.158 --> 45:57.244
Oh.

46:01.331 --> 46:03.458
Well, this is amazing.

46:03.458 --> 46:05.585
It's changing.

46:05.585 --> 46:07.504
Yeah. They fall in love again

46:07.504 --> 46:10.132
and then they get back together
one year from today.

46:12.843 --> 46:14.886
Jamie!

46:24.146 --> 46:26.231
Yo, man! Watch out!

46:32.070 --> 46:34.114
Look out!

46:41.371 --> 46:43.415
Oh, boy!
