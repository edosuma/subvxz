News Anchor:
In local news, child murderer
Joseph Eli Lipnip

00:04.905 --> 00:06.825
is scheduled to die tomorrow
by lethal injection,

00:06.840 --> 00:09.510
his execution already drawing
dozens more spectators

00:09.543 --> 00:11.145
than the death of TV news.
Carla?

00:11.179 --> 00:13.514
Carla Johnson: The man
that once ate his own son...

00:13.547 --> 00:15.916
Wow. He's really getting
executed after all this time.
is finally being put down

00:15.949 --> 00:17.351
at the state
correctional facility.

00:17.385 --> 00:18.486
You know the son
that he ate was...

00:18.519 --> 00:19.687
Your best friend...
Tommy.

00:19.720 --> 00:20.854
We know.
Stop true-crime bragging.

00:20.888 --> 00:22.390
I was traumatized, Summer.

00:22.423 --> 00:23.657
Okay, your generation
wouldn't get that.

00:23.691 --> 00:24.858
Bitch, my generation

00:24.892 --> 00:26.494
gets traumatized for breakfast.

00:26.527 --> 00:29.197
It took years of therapy
to even process the reality.

00:29.230 --> 00:30.531
I mean, when I was a kid,

00:30.564 --> 00:32.665
I just told myself
that Tommy had gotten lost

00:32.700 --> 00:34.835
in the magical realm
of Froopyland.

00:34.868 --> 00:36.837
"Froopyland?"
My make-believe world.

00:36.870 --> 00:39.507
I know the name's stupid,
but it was so real to me.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.008
Aren't you guys supposed
to be at your father's

00:41.041 --> 00:42.176
for custody weekend?

00:42.210 --> 00:44.178
We're not in a hurry.
Dad sleeps until sundown.

00:44.212 --> 00:45.779
Can we talk a little bit more
about this Froopy...

00:45.813 --> 00:47.014
Summer:
Not the bubble gun!

00:47.047 --> 00:50.017
There's no air...

00:50.050 --> 00:52.786
I gotta say, I am warming up
to the bubble gun.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.288
You know, if you're so great
at naming things,

00:54.322 --> 00:55.623
why don't you do it from now on?

00:55.656 --> 00:56.890
- What?
- Froopyland.

00:56.924 --> 00:58.926
Was it my best work?
I don't know.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.761
Does it deserve
to be shit on creatively?

01:00.794 --> 01:02.230
Yeah, that's right.

01:02.263 --> 01:03.864
I agree with your look
of horrified realization.

01:03.897 --> 01:06.534
You can be very inconsiderate
sometimes.

01:07.935 --> 01:09.103
Here it is.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.538
You know, I collapsed
a quantum tesseract to...

01:10.571 --> 01:11.891
Dad, I don't care
how you made it.

01:11.905 --> 01:13.374
I want to know if Tommy's
still in there!

01:13.407 --> 01:14.742
Relax, Beth.

01:14.775 --> 01:16.244
If he is, we'll find him.

01:16.277 --> 01:18.212
He'll be the only
sun-bleached skeleton

01:18.246 --> 01:20.881
with non-imaginary DNA.

01:20.914 --> 01:28.914
**

01:31.425 --> 01:39.425
**

01:42.102 --> 01:50.102
**

01:52.613 --> 01:53.814
Tommy!

01:53.847 --> 01:54.648
Tommy!

01:54.682 --> 01:55.949
This is a nightmare.

01:55.983 --> 01:57.351
I can't believe
you used to lock me up

01:57.385 --> 01:59.086
in this glorified chicken coop.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.188
Chicken coop?

02:00.221 --> 02:02.356
Those are procedurally
generated clouds, Beth.

02:02.390 --> 02:04.192
That river is a rainbow.
Literally.

02:04.225 --> 02:06.305
Come on, I-I-I put real
elbow grease into this place.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.362
Well, you're supposed to put
elbow grease into your daughter!

02:08.395 --> 02:09.663
Gross.

02:09.697 --> 02:11.137
Do you think something ate him?
Nope.

02:11.165 --> 02:12.766
Froopyland creatures
were designed to be harmless.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.368
He definitely
just starved to death.

02:14.402 --> 02:16.036
I could have been the one
who starved to death in here.

02:16.069 --> 02:17.538
What if I'd gotten hurt?

02:17.571 --> 02:18.972
God, you're right.
I'm a terrible dad.

02:19.006 --> 02:20.441
Well, nothing to live for.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.543
Goodbye, cruel world!
Dad!

02:22.576 --> 02:24.111
Oh, how do you like that?

02:24.144 --> 02:27.014
What kind of merciless creator
makes the ground bouncy?

02:27.047 --> 02:29.350
I'm gonna have to drown myself.

02:29.383 --> 02:30.618
Unh!

02:30.651 --> 02:32.353
Oh, no.
Oh, the water's breathable?

02:32.386 --> 02:33.454
Who went and did that?

02:33.487 --> 02:34.488
Oh, whatever.

02:34.522 --> 02:35.689
Yeah, whatever.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.558
A dad makes a toilet
look like R2-D2,

02:37.591 --> 02:38.892
and it breaks the front page
of Reddit,

02:38.926 --> 02:40.861
but I'm Charles Manson
because I gave you

02:40.894 --> 02:42.296
your own world
instead of an iPad.

02:42.330 --> 02:44.164
I think the words you're
looking for are... Aah!

02:44.198 --> 02:46.700
Holy fuck!
Shit! This thing has claws!

02:46.734 --> 02:48.569
Yeah, I get it.
It's a childproof world.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.871
No, no, seriously,
this hurts really bad!

02:50.904 --> 02:53.140
This thing is sinking
razor-sharp claws in...

02:53.173 --> 02:54.475
Aah!
Shit!

02:54.508 --> 02:57.144
You've made your point, Dad.

02:57.177 --> 02:58.177
Dad?

02:59.547 --> 03:02.483
Ugh!

03:02.516 --> 03:05.419
Whose idea was this stupid
custody weekend thing?

03:05.453 --> 03:07.655
I think it's supposed to help
prevent abandonment issues.

03:07.688 --> 03:08.989
I want to be abandoned.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.658
Yeah, I'm talking about Dad.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.493
Bienvenue a la
Chez Divorced Dad.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.027
Wow, Dad.

03:14.061 --> 03:16.163
Your place looks way less
like a crackhouse.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.899
It's actually clean,
like a cocaine house.

03:18.932 --> 03:20.067
Dad, what's going on?

03:20.100 --> 03:22.370
I'm simply centered,
activated...

03:23.537 --> 03:24.605
And telekinetic?

03:24.638 --> 03:25.739
Pretty cool, huh?

03:25.773 --> 03:27.608
Check it out.
Who wants a smoothie?

03:30.311 --> 03:31.412
Oh... Oh, no.
Uh, oh, God.

03:31.445 --> 03:32.546
Summer... Summer,
can you...

03:32.580 --> 03:33.914
- Aah!
- Sorry.

03:33.947 --> 03:36.049
You have much to learn, my Uloo.

03:36.083 --> 03:39.687
Morty, Summer, this is Kiara.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.555
She's a Krootabulan
warrior priestess

03:41.589 --> 03:42.923
from Krootabulon.

03:42.956 --> 03:45.125
I-I know where Krootabulans
are from, Dad.

03:45.158 --> 03:46.360
Uh, Chaimuntolo.

03:46.394 --> 03:47.528
Chaimuntolo, younglings.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.263
Hymen... cholo.

03:49.297 --> 03:51.064
Your father's mind
holds love for you.

03:51.098 --> 03:53.200
I am humbled to meet
in physicality.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.268
Dad, are you...

03:54.302 --> 03:57.204
In love with a badass,
sexy alien lady?

03:57.237 --> 03:59.407
Ha, ha, I don't know, Summer.
You tell me.

03:59.440 --> 04:01.442
I wasn't going to ask
if you were in love

04:01.475 --> 04:02.643
since you barely know her.

04:02.676 --> 04:04.044
Summer.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.646
Kiara and I met on that
interstellar dating service

04:05.679 --> 04:06.780
Rick was always suggesting

04:06.814 --> 04:07.915
when your mom and I
were together.

04:07.948 --> 04:10.584
And things just kind of clicked.

04:10.618 --> 04:11.819
We must move!

04:11.852 --> 04:13.487
Our reservation
is at 7:00.

04:13.521 --> 04:15.155
I hate to see her leave,

04:15.188 --> 04:18.158
but I love to watch
her phase shift away.

04:18.190 --> 04:20.127
I'm sure you noticed
what she has three of,

04:20.160 --> 04:22.796
but guess what she has two of?

04:26.166 --> 04:27.067
Oof!

04:27.100 --> 04:28.469
All right, knock it off!

04:28.502 --> 04:29.970
Listen, I've been
giving you a pass

04:30.003 --> 04:32.072
because I'm charmed
that life finds a way, but...

04:32.105 --> 04:33.741
Aah!
All right, you know what?

04:33.774 --> 04:36.344
Ouch!

04:36.377 --> 04:37.745
Oh!
Unh!

04:37.778 --> 04:39.647
Ouch!
God!

04:39.680 --> 04:41.349
Aah!

04:41.382 --> 04:43.150
Agh!

04:44.217 --> 04:45.919
Oh, Dad, this place
is the safest.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.287
Best dad ever.

04:47.321 --> 04:49.657
Can't you just say,
"I admit it, I screwed up"?

04:49.690 --> 04:50.924
Uh, what would be
the point of that?

04:50.958 --> 04:52.159
You can't do it, can you?

04:52.192 --> 04:54.595
You can't just
fucking apologize.

04:54.628 --> 04:56.764
Okay, okay, Beth, I'm sorry...

04:56.797 --> 04:58.799
you think you deserve
an apology.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.601
Hey, don't look at me.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.269
You let your kid roll around
on the floor of a target,

05:02.302 --> 05:03.637
it's gonna get stepped on.

05:07.808 --> 05:09.977
Huh. Well, here's the problem
right here.

05:10.010 --> 05:12.179
We've got a bunch of
Froopyland procedural carbons

05:12.212 --> 05:14.948
all gummed up and mixed in
with real human DNA.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.116
Are you saying
Tommy survived here

05:16.149 --> 05:17.451
by having sex
with Froopy creatures,

05:17.485 --> 05:18.886
creating Froopy-human
hybrid offspring,

05:18.919 --> 05:20.788
and then consuming
their proteins,

05:20.821 --> 05:22.956
sustaining himself with
an endless cycle of
cannibalistic incest?

05:22.990 --> 05:24.124
It's just a working theory.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.393
Of course, if that's the case,

05:25.426 --> 05:26.894
I expect he'd be worshiped
as a kind of god

05:26.927 --> 05:28.161
by a medieval-level
society

05:28.195 --> 05:29.563
of his least-delicious
children.

05:29.597 --> 05:30.831
Halt!

05:30.864 --> 05:32.032
You are now prisoners
of our exalted ruler,

05:32.065 --> 05:33.567
giver and taker of life,

05:33.601 --> 05:35.202
helper and consumer
of mortality,

05:35.235 --> 05:36.704
dispenser of life...
Yes,
if I could interrupt?

05:36.737 --> 05:37.905
We're way ahead
of the reveal here.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.306
Yeah, just take us
to King Tommy.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.141
I thought warrior priestesses

05:41.174 --> 05:42.976
could only leave Krootabulon
on a hunt.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.144
Mmm.
Thank you, sweetie.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.313
I hope it's not human season.

05:46.346 --> 05:49.983
I'm on Earth hunting the Varrix.
I would never hunt a human.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.252
Your father and I
are soul-bonded.

05:52.285 --> 05:53.320
Soul-bonded?

05:53.353 --> 05:54.988
Um, does your planet
have shorter days,

05:55.022 --> 05:57.190
because you guys are moving
kind of fast, no?

06:02.796 --> 06:03.864
Go get him, honey!

06:03.897 --> 06:06.033
She's always hunting.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.501
She probably knew
a Varrix worked here,

06:07.535 --> 06:10.103
and that's why she said
the Yelp reviews didn't matter.

06:10.137 --> 06:11.439
Dad, do you understand

06:11.472 --> 06:13.541
how serious
Krootabulon soul-bonding is?

06:13.574 --> 06:17.210
Uh, gee, Morty, I don't know.
It's got such a casual name.

06:17.244 --> 06:18.779
If you want to lecture anyone
about commitment,

06:18.812 --> 06:20.113
start with your mom.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.382
Oh, my God.
Dad, is that what this is about?

06:22.416 --> 06:24.752
Are you rushing into a new thing
to get back at Mom?

06:24.785 --> 06:27.020
Every weekend, you two
have told me to move on.

06:27.054 --> 06:28.456
Move on, like, out of bed.

06:28.489 --> 06:30.724
Like, stop using paper towels
for toilet paper,

06:30.758 --> 06:32.960
not move on
into a sloppy rebound.

06:32.993 --> 06:35.529
Dad, you need to slow down,
rethink this soul bond.

06:35.563 --> 06:37.865
Why don't you just say
what you really mean?

06:37.898 --> 06:39.099
You think it's cool

06:39.132 --> 06:41.101
that having sex with her
gives me telekinesis

06:41.134 --> 06:43.070
and you recognize
she's got a hot bod

06:43.103 --> 06:44.872
like Cheetara in "Thundercats,"

06:44.905 --> 06:46.106
but you're grossed out

06:46.139 --> 06:48.609
by her avocado-shaped head
and blue skin,

06:48.642 --> 06:51.512
and you think I want to put
a bag and a wig on her head.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.314
After all the time
and energy I spent

06:54.347 --> 06:55.883
teaching you two about race...

06:55.916 --> 06:57.618
you ended up racist.

06:58.952 --> 07:00.554
Soon your world
will be rid of Varrix.

07:00.588 --> 07:02.322
Tomorrow, we celebrate.

07:02.355 --> 07:03.955
We could take the kids
to the water park.

07:03.957 --> 07:06.093
We celebrate with a hunt!

07:06.126 --> 07:07.995
Ooh.
You kids want to hunt?

07:08.028 --> 07:09.062
- Yes.
- Yes.

07:10.764 --> 07:13.934
All kneel for King Tommy!

07:13.967 --> 07:15.836
I'm not kneeling.
Suck my dick.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.905
Well, hello, all!

07:17.938 --> 07:20.107
I am the King of Froopyland,

07:20.140 --> 07:22.810
but I go by another name, too.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.745
We know.
It's Tommy!

07:24.778 --> 07:25.979
- We know.
- We know.

07:26.013 --> 07:29.082
I have lived here
since I was a mere child.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.150
- We know.
- Got it.

07:30.183 --> 07:31.752
I suppose you're wondering,

07:31.785 --> 07:33.821
how do I sustain myself?

07:33.854 --> 07:34.922
- Oh, boy.
- No, we aren't.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.990
I always find the theater

07:37.024 --> 07:39.259
is the best way
to clarify things.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.293
- Ugh.
- Seriously?

07:40.327 --> 07:42.496
Oh, my God.
Players, go!

07:42.530 --> 07:43.964
I am little Tommy.

07:45.132 --> 07:46.767
I am tiny Beth.

07:48.802 --> 07:49.837
Oh, come on.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.772
Come with me to a magic land.

07:51.805 --> 07:52.940
Froopy: Don't do it!

07:52.973 --> 07:55.108
This is my secret Froopyland

07:55.142 --> 07:57.277
where I have no rules!

07:57.310 --> 07:58.546
I am excited.

07:58.579 --> 08:02.783
I am jealous of Tommy's friends
and his Nintendo

08:02.816 --> 08:04.618
and his dad who likes him.

08:04.652 --> 08:07.120
I take it Tommy wasn't
class playwright.

08:07.154 --> 08:09.022
You want to see the Honey Swamp?

08:09.056 --> 08:11.158
Yes!
Let's do it!

08:11.191 --> 08:13.060
Well, I want to see you dead.

08:13.093 --> 08:15.462
Ow, help!
I'm stuck!

08:15.495 --> 08:16.830
I'm covered in honey.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.532
Huh.
Well, that's interesting.

08:18.566 --> 08:19.733
Fake news.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.401
Many nights have passed,

08:21.434 --> 08:24.204
trapped in this strange land.

08:24.237 --> 08:29.543
I am hungry, and all I can do
to pass the time is hump.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.879
I will hump this rock.

08:33.246 --> 08:34.982
I will hump this tree.

08:36.283 --> 08:38.852
I will hump
this beast of the land

08:38.885 --> 08:40.821
and put my seed in it.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.492
I am the first
of Tommy's children.

08:45.525 --> 08:49.396
Eat of my flesh
so you may survive.

08:49.429 --> 08:51.899
And so I did.

08:51.932 --> 08:53.567
Oh, wow.

08:53.601 --> 08:54.835
Okay.
Yeah.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.170
Certified fresh.
Good... Good job.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.840
Perhaps a demonstration is
in order.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.175
No, that is the last thing
that is in order!
Ugh.

09:02.209 --> 09:03.711
Oh, my God.
Poor Froopy character.

09:03.744 --> 09:05.378
Leave him alone.

09:05.412 --> 09:07.681
- Ahh.
- Gather round, gang!

09:07.715 --> 09:08.716
Dinner time.

09:10.050 --> 09:12.886
All right, that's it.
I'm outta here.

09:12.920 --> 09:14.387
What are you doing?

09:14.421 --> 09:15.723
We're in the middle
of an adventure.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.524
Here's some things
an adventure needs, Beth.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.860
Conflict, stakes,
a way for me to benefit,

09:19.893 --> 09:21.194
and, clearly, Morty.

09:21.228 --> 09:22.562
But Tommy's still in there,

09:22.596 --> 09:24.431
raping Muppets
and eating babies.

09:24.464 --> 09:26.066
Yep. Luckily,
that's not our problem.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.200
Time to pull the plug.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.435
Pull the plug?

09:28.468 --> 09:30.203
We have to get Tommy
out of there, okay?

09:30.237 --> 09:31.538
We... We need to do
the right thing.

09:31.571 --> 09:33.040
Do what you never did
as a dad...

09:33.073 --> 09:34.274
Put in a little effort.

09:34.307 --> 09:35.542
All right,
cut the high-road routine.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.210
We both saw Tommy's shitty play.

09:37.244 --> 09:38.712
You pushed him
in the Honey Swamp, Beth.

09:38.746 --> 09:40.714
His very happy life
is in your hands.

09:40.748 --> 09:42.315
You go save him from it.

09:42.349 --> 09:44.584
You're gonna believe
a play over your own daughter?

09:44.618 --> 09:47.054
Yes, I am, Beth,
because you're not
my own daughter.

09:47.087 --> 09:48.088
Oh, God, yes.

09:48.121 --> 09:49.389
I'm one of infinite Beths

09:49.422 --> 09:51.391
with infinite fathers
in infinite universes.

09:51.424 --> 09:52.993
It's called a hug, Dad.
It won't kill you.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.327
Yeah, don't be so sure.

09:54.361 --> 09:55.921
You know why all Ricks
made a Froopyland

09:55.929 --> 09:57.064
for all their little girls?

09:57.097 --> 09:58.431
Same reason I wasn't surprised

09:58.465 --> 10:00.167
by Tommy's overwritten,
badly structured,

10:00.200 --> 10:01.501
cheaply produced flashback.

10:01.534 --> 10:03.403
You were a scary fuckin' kid,
man.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.738
Oh, my God.

10:04.772 --> 10:06.740
I didn't make Froopyland
to get rid of you, Beth.

10:06.774 --> 10:08.475
I did it to protect
the neighborhood.

10:08.508 --> 10:10.077
Not in a noble sense.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.611
It was just more practical
to sequester you

10:11.645 --> 10:14.014
before I had to start,
you know, cloning a replacement

10:14.047 --> 10:16.917
for every less-than-polite
little boy or gullible animal

10:16.950 --> 10:18.518
that might cross
your socio-path.

10:18.551 --> 10:20.520
You would rather believe
I'm evil

10:20.553 --> 10:22.089
than admit that
you were a bad father?

10:22.122 --> 10:23.523
Oh, dude, no.

10:23.556 --> 10:25.292
No, bad father all the way
to the max over here.

10:25.325 --> 10:26.593
I'm a fuckin' nutcase.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.428
And the acorn plopped
straight down, baby.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.763
Look at some of this shit

10:29.797 --> 10:31.531
you were asking me
to make you as a kid.

10:31.564 --> 10:32.599
Ray guns.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.367
A whip that forces people
to like you.

10:34.401 --> 10:38.305
Invisibility cuffs,
a parent trap, a lightning gun,

10:38.338 --> 10:40.774
a teddy bear with
anatomically correct innards,

10:40.808 --> 10:44.611
night-vision googly-eye glasses,
sound-erasing sneakers,

10:44.644 --> 10:47.781
false fingerprints,
fall-asleep darts,

10:47.815 --> 10:51.451
a lie-detecting doll,
an indestructible baseball bat,

10:51.484 --> 10:55.055
a Taser shaped like a ladybug,
a fake police badge,

10:55.088 --> 10:58.558
location-tracking stickers,
rainbow-colored duct tape,

10:58.591 --> 11:02.462
mind-control hair clips,
poison gum,

11:02.495 --> 11:04.364
a pink, sentient switchblade.

11:04.397 --> 11:06.033
Hi, Beth, you've gotten taller.

11:06.066 --> 11:07.167
Shall we resume stabbing?

11:07.200 --> 11:08.368
Has it occurred to you

11:08.401 --> 11:09.636
that I asked you
to make those things

11:09.669 --> 11:11.471
because I wanted you
to spend time with me?

11:11.504 --> 11:14.141
Has it occurred to you that
if I did try killing Tommy,

11:14.174 --> 11:16.309
it might be because
I was jealous of his family?

11:16.343 --> 11:17.677
Wait, what?
Why?

11:17.711 --> 11:19.146
Wasn't his dad, like,
some kind of cannibal?

11:19.179 --> 11:20.380
Seems like it must be
hereditary.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.149
Oh, my God.
This is your fault.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.550
I am not a bad person.

11:23.583 --> 11:24.985
I'm gonna go back in there,

11:25.018 --> 11:26.987
I'm getting Tommy,
and I'm fixing this!

11:27.020 --> 11:30.690
Whatever you say,
Stone Cold Steve Austin.

11:30.724 --> 11:32.259
I don't know why
I just said that.

11:32.292 --> 11:34.661
Doesn't make a lot of sense,
but gotta stand by it.

11:34.694 --> 11:37.197
Whatever you say,
Stone Cold Steve Austin.

11:37.230 --> 11:38.465
I'm owning it.

11:42.803 --> 11:45.172
- Morty: No, Dad!
- You're not doing it right!

11:45.205 --> 11:47.174
Cutting off their heads
isn't doing it right?

11:47.207 --> 11:49.409
They're clearly regenerative!

11:49.442 --> 11:52.012
I-I think you have to stab them
through the heart or something.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.546
You think or you know?

11:53.580 --> 11:55.916
I thought you were the alien
expert, Isaac Asi-hole.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.751
Don't snap at me!
I'm tired!

11:57.785 --> 11:59.552
- Me, too!
- We're all tired!

12:02.956 --> 12:04.591
That's the last of them.

12:04.624 --> 12:06.226
Tonight, we celebrate.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.094
With a hunt?

12:07.127 --> 12:12.132
Yes, for tomorrow, we hunt.

12:18.405 --> 12:22.109
I, uh, really have to get out
of this soul bond.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.622
- What the fuck, Dad?
- Oh, my God! Duh!

12:23.643 --> 12:24.644
- Obviously!
- Yeah, no kidding!

12:24.677 --> 12:25.712
Can you guys help me?

12:25.745 --> 12:27.047
What? How?

12:27.080 --> 12:28.715
Can I just, uh, tell her
it's because of my kids?

12:28.748 --> 12:31.284
You know, like, you don't like
the shape of her head, or...

12:31.318 --> 12:33.620
That's you, Dad!
That's you!

12:33.653 --> 12:35.455
You're a baby and an idiot!

12:35.488 --> 12:37.757
I think that's been established,
Summer. Now help me!

12:37.791 --> 12:39.126
First, I want you to admit

12:39.159 --> 12:41.461
that you're a closet racist,
a beta-male sexist,

12:41.494 --> 12:43.763
and you dragged everyone
into a horrible situation

12:43.797 --> 12:45.298
by only thinking of ourself.

12:45.332 --> 12:46.166
Okay.

12:46.199 --> 12:47.901
I want to hear you say it.

12:49.970 --> 12:51.905
Look, I'm a closeted racist,

12:51.939 --> 12:53.606
and I'm sexist and selfish,

12:53.640 --> 12:56.910
and I dragged us all into
my sexist, racist bad things

12:56.944 --> 12:58.478
because I'm stupid.
Thank you.

12:58.511 --> 13:00.647
Now you're gonna help me,
right?
She just did.

13:00.680 --> 13:02.582
Yeah, clean up your own mess.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.484
Wait, wait, what?

13:04.517 --> 13:06.086
Oh, man.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.988
Tommy: All right, everybody.

13:08.021 --> 13:09.256
Next item on the docket...

13:09.289 --> 13:11.358
I would like to have sex
with some of you,

13:11.391 --> 13:14.161
and then eat the babies.

13:14.194 --> 13:15.495
I thought you'd like that.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.497
I do keep rolling out
the hits, don't I?

13:18.698 --> 13:21.268
Oh!
It's the Magic Crayon Lady!

13:21.301 --> 13:23.871
Are you hungry?
I was just about to make dinner.

13:23.904 --> 13:25.472
And by "make dinner," I mean...

13:25.505 --> 13:28.275
Tommy, I'm going to take you
to the real world.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.843
Well, this is the real world.

13:29.877 --> 13:31.317
No, you don't understand!
Your dad...

13:31.344 --> 13:33.380
Uh, people think
your dad ate you!

13:33.413 --> 13:34.982
So?
You doy-oy!

13:35.015 --> 13:36.483
People should eat people.

13:36.516 --> 13:37.650
Just leave me alone!

13:37.684 --> 13:39.486
Tommy, you don't understand.

13:39.519 --> 13:40.787
I have to make this right

13:40.820 --> 13:42.822
because it's my fault
that you're in here.

13:42.856 --> 13:44.691
I'm Beth.

13:44.724 --> 13:45.792
- Beth?
- The destroyer!

13:45.825 --> 13:46.994
The destroyer!

13:47.027 --> 13:48.862
Oh, suck it up, Princess Incest.

13:48.896 --> 13:50.330
You fell into some honey.

13:50.363 --> 13:53.733
Well, it tends to happen
when one is pushed into honey.

13:53.766 --> 13:56.870
I respect your right
to believe I pushed you.

13:56.904 --> 13:58.538
Oh, do I get to have that?

13:58.571 --> 14:00.673
Is my reality like
a little side of fries...

14:00.707 --> 14:03.343
A little Kwanzaa
you're willing to slide my way?

14:03.376 --> 14:06.246
Yes, because I'm focused
on saving your father's life

14:06.279 --> 14:08.148
because I'm not
a petty piece of shit.

14:08.181 --> 14:10.217
So, then,
it should be pretty easy

14:10.250 --> 14:12.319
to say,
"Sorry I pushed you."

14:12.352 --> 14:13.987
Real easy and not necessary,

14:14.021 --> 14:15.555
since you coming home
will save your dad's life

14:15.588 --> 14:16.924
whereas nothing is changed

14:16.957 --> 14:18.725
by anyone stroking
your batshit-crazy ego.

14:18.758 --> 14:20.060
Sorry, forgive me.

14:20.093 --> 14:21.661
Uh, I've been in Froopyland
for quite a while.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.163
Have apologies changed?

14:23.196 --> 14:25.899
Tommy, I'm sorry you think
you deserve an apology.

14:25.933 --> 14:27.200
Oh, my God.
I'm my father.

14:27.234 --> 14:30.037
Uh, will someone
just kill this B-word?

14:31.271 --> 14:32.672
Hi-ya!

14:32.705 --> 14:35.008
Oh, my God.
I'm my father!

14:35.042 --> 14:36.409
Ya!
Ooh! Froopy!

14:37.777 --> 14:39.712
Switchblade:
It's stab time!
Together: Ooh!

14:40.948 --> 14:43.216
And that's why one pussy
plus two pussies

14:43.250 --> 14:46.053
makes a bunch of pussies.

14:46.086 --> 14:47.254
Come on, y'all,
I'm trying to make this

14:47.287 --> 14:49.189
appealing to your
sex-addicted lifestyles.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.925
Hi, I need to pull Morty out of
school. Come on, Morty.

14:51.959 --> 14:53.860
Ha! You heard
your daddy, Morty.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.195
You have to leave school.

14:55.228 --> 14:56.930
Wait, what are my values?

14:56.964 --> 14:58.631
Dad, what's going on?
We're going to Alaska.

14:58.665 --> 15:00.300
What? Why?
It's nice there.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.435
Also, I broke up with Kiara,
and she didn't take it well,

15:02.469 --> 15:03.870
and she wants to murder you two.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.438
What? Th-Then why
are we walking?

15:05.472 --> 15:06.906
I'm walking because I'm tired.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.180
You guys should definitely run.

15:10.677 --> 15:12.079
Excuse me, I just...

15:12.112 --> 15:14.047
You know what?
I'm... I'm just gonna go left.

15:14.081 --> 15:15.615
No, okay, your left,
that's fine.

15:15.648 --> 15:18.751
Do you know what left is,
'cause... Ugh!

15:18.785 --> 15:21.121
What does your breakup
have to do with us?

15:21.154 --> 15:22.722
Yeah, we chose Mom hands down.

15:22.755 --> 15:24.491
I thought we made that clear
at the lawyer's office

15:24.524 --> 15:27.094
and in the comments under
your weird rant on Facebook.

15:28.461 --> 15:31.064
She kind of blames you guys
for the breakup.

15:31.098 --> 15:32.299
- Why?
- Why?

15:32.332 --> 15:33.772
Because I told her
it was your fault.

15:33.800 --> 15:34.834
- What?!
- What?!

15:34.867 --> 15:36.403
Look, I'm not an evil person.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.571
I'm just not very imaginative!

15:43.443 --> 15:44.443
Oh!

15:45.345 --> 15:47.114
Rick:
* Doo-doo butt

15:47.147 --> 15:49.116
* Doo-doo-doo... doo-doo butt

15:49.149 --> 15:50.350
No.

15:50.383 --> 15:52.585
* Doo-doo butt,
doo-doo butt *

15:52.619 --> 15:54.521
Hey.
Hey.

15:54.554 --> 15:58.491
Um, hmm, so just, like,
out of curiosity,

15:58.525 --> 16:00.493
if you were gonna make
a clone of Tommy,

16:00.527 --> 16:02.095
what would you need
to get started?

16:02.129 --> 16:03.863
I don't kn...
Tommy's DNA?

16:03.896 --> 16:05.632
Okay, 'cause he, um...

16:05.665 --> 16:07.867
Yeah, he didn't
want to come back,

16:07.900 --> 16:10.303
so, um, he gave me this.

16:10.337 --> 16:12.005
He gave you his finger?

16:12.039 --> 16:13.340
Uh, well, what happened is...

16:13.373 --> 16:15.342
It's okay.
It doesn't matter.
Okay.

16:15.375 --> 16:17.010
This'll take about three hours.

16:17.044 --> 16:18.645
Okay.

16:18.678 --> 16:20.513
Hey.
You want to help?

16:20.547 --> 16:22.349
Okay.

16:22.382 --> 16:25.485
* Doo
* I got a doo-doo in my butt

16:25.518 --> 16:29.522
* Doo-doo-doo-doo
* And I don't know what to do

16:29.556 --> 16:31.891
* With the doo-doo in my butt

16:31.924 --> 16:36.329
* But I know that a father
should say to you *

16:36.363 --> 16:38.698
* That he's proud of you

16:38.731 --> 16:41.834
* Doo
* Every daughter is a doo-doo
from a father's butt *

16:41.868 --> 16:45.372
* Biologically speaking,
the butt is a nut *

16:45.405 --> 16:47.640
* And every father
fathers wrong *

16:47.674 --> 16:50.043
* Ooh * And there isn't a song

16:50.077 --> 16:53.046
* That can change that

16:53.080 --> 16:55.582
I am wiped out.
I guess I'll turn in.

16:55.615 --> 16:57.984
Cool.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.186
Dad?

16:59.219 --> 17:00.887
I feel like I've spent my life

17:00.920 --> 17:04.557
pretending you're a great guy
and trying to be like you.

17:04.590 --> 17:06.259
And the ugly truth
has always been...

17:06.292 --> 17:10.163
That I'm not that great a guy
and you're exactly like me.

17:10.196 --> 17:11.198
Am I evil?

17:11.231 --> 17:12.732
Worse.
You're smart.

17:12.765 --> 17:15.234
When you know nothing matters,
the universe is yours.

17:15.268 --> 17:17.369
And I've never met a universe
that was into it.

17:17.404 --> 17:19.005
The universe is
basically an animal.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.406
It grazes on the ordinary.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.509
It creates infinite idiots
just to eat them,

17:22.541 --> 17:24.544
not unlike
your friend Timmy.
Tommy.

17:24.577 --> 17:26.113
Yeah, it hardly matters now,
sweetie.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.047
You know, smart people get
a chance to climb on top,

17:28.080 --> 17:29.382
take reality for a ride,

17:29.416 --> 17:31.118
but it'll never stop
trying to throw you.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.352
And, eventually, it will.

17:32.385 --> 17:34.121
There's no other way off.

17:34.154 --> 17:37.757
Dad, I'm out of excuses
to not be who I am.

17:37.790 --> 17:40.760
So who am I?
What do I do?

17:40.793 --> 17:42.229
My advice...
Take off.

17:42.262 --> 17:44.797
Put a saddle on your universe.
Let it kick itself out.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.065
I can't do that.

17:46.099 --> 17:47.700
The kids, Jerry, my job,

17:47.734 --> 17:49.636
and, as much as I hate to admit
it, ABC's "The Bachelor."

17:49.669 --> 17:51.938
I can make a clone of you,
a perfect instance of you,

17:51.971 --> 17:53.039
with all your memories.

17:53.072 --> 17:54.474
An exact copy in every way.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.276
It'll love and provide
for the kids,

17:56.309 --> 17:59.546
do your job, and consume
broadcast-network reality TV

17:59.579 --> 18:02.081
on the same allegedly ironic
level as you.

18:02.115 --> 18:03.416
You could be gone a day, a week,

18:03.450 --> 18:05.618
or the rest of your life
with zero consequences.

18:05.652 --> 18:07.120
The moment you decide
to come back,

18:07.154 --> 18:09.489
I flip a switch,
and the clone's job is done.

18:09.522 --> 18:11.291
It feels no pain,
it regrets nothing,

18:11.324 --> 18:14.661
and has zero chance
of going "Blade Runner."

18:14.694 --> 18:17.497
If nothing matters,
why would you do that for me?

18:17.530 --> 18:20.133
I don't know, maybe you matter
so little that I like you.

18:20.167 --> 18:22.235
Or maybe it makes you matter.

18:22.269 --> 18:23.303
Maybe I love you.

18:23.336 --> 18:24.471
Maybe something about
your mother.

18:24.504 --> 18:27.140
Don't jump a gift shark
in the mouth.

18:27.174 --> 18:28.475
I don't know if I can do it.

18:28.508 --> 18:30.477
Then stay,
and luxuriate in a life

18:30.510 --> 18:32.345
you can finally know
you've chosen.

18:32.379 --> 18:34.647
My secret bonus is that
no matter what you choose,

18:34.681 --> 18:36.816
you're finally gonna
chill the fuck out.

18:42.555 --> 18:44.291
Okay.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.659
I know what I want to do.

18:47.694 --> 18:48.695
Aah!

18:48.728 --> 18:50.163
Ow!

18:50.197 --> 18:52.165
You can't run forever!

18:52.199 --> 18:53.433
She's really pissed off.

18:53.466 --> 18:55.202
I know.
It's kinda hot.

18:55.235 --> 18:56.503
Shut up!

18:56.536 --> 18:58.771
The hunters!
They're back! Run!

18:58.805 --> 19:00.440
- We're not hunters.
- We want to hide with you.

19:00.473 --> 19:02.209
We're not hiding.
We're nesting.

19:02.242 --> 19:03.276
Ooh la la.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.346
The children must be destroyed

19:06.379 --> 19:07.714
so that we can be together.

19:07.747 --> 19:11.351
You need to break up with her,
Dad... properly!

19:11.384 --> 19:13.220
God damn it, Dad!

19:13.253 --> 19:15.322
Dump her!

19:15.355 --> 19:16.356
Okay, okay.

19:16.389 --> 19:18.325
Kiara, let's just run away.

19:18.358 --> 19:19.359
- Dad!
- Come on!

19:19.392 --> 19:20.827
Just rip
the Band-Aid off!

19:20.860 --> 19:22.195
Okay!

19:22.229 --> 19:24.163
Kiara, when I told you
my kids were bigoted racists

19:24.197 --> 19:26.032
who were demanding
I break up with you,

19:26.065 --> 19:27.467
I lied.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.540
If anybody deserves to be
telekinetically strangled,

19:29.569 --> 19:30.703
it's me.

19:30.737 --> 19:34.307
I'm the one who
wants to break up.

19:34.341 --> 19:36.008
I... I'm not
an evil person.

19:36.042 --> 19:37.377
I'm lazy, I'm cowardly,

19:37.410 --> 19:39.646
and... and I do not
know what I'm doing.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.748
Look, I got someone pregnant
at 17.

19:41.781 --> 19:44.484
We're getting a divorce.
None of this is on purpose.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.219
I was excited
to date someone cool

19:46.253 --> 19:49.356
because it would make
my ex notice me.

19:49.389 --> 19:53.726
I would expect nothing less
from humanity...

19:53.760 --> 19:56.429
A selfish, manipulative,
dishonest species that...

19:56.463 --> 19:59.332
- Kiara?
- Trandor!

19:59.366 --> 20:00.767
What are you doing here?

20:00.800 --> 20:02.235
Just... hunting.

20:02.269 --> 20:03.903
Do you really expect me
to believe

20:03.936 --> 20:06.038
it has nothing to do with us?

20:06.072 --> 20:07.540
You knew Earth was my domain.

20:07.574 --> 20:09.509
I don't like what
you're insinuating.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.344
Dad, can we go now?
Hold on a second.

20:11.378 --> 20:14.414
I'm starting to get the feeling
that I was the rebound.

20:14.447 --> 20:16.283
Dad, you just got handed
an Ex Machina.

20:16.316 --> 20:17.584
You're taking it.

20:17.617 --> 20:21.087
Varrix nests spread
across 300 galaxies,

20:21.120 --> 20:23.790
and you just happened to pick
this planet to hunt?

20:23.823 --> 20:27.126
That's Gorgon shit...
Total Gorgon shit!

20:28.395 --> 20:30.096
We're home!

20:30.129 --> 20:31.631
Hey, guys!
What's for dinner?

20:31.664 --> 20:33.266
How was Jerry's?
The usual.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.535
Can we have pizza?
Pizza sounds great.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.637
Hey, Rick, did you know my dad
was dating an alien?

20:37.670 --> 20:40.139
No. Gross.
For the alien.

20:40.172 --> 20:42.609
Aw, crap, I think
Arnaldo's is closed.

20:42.642 --> 20:44.210
Are you guys sure
you want pizza?

20:46.479 --> 20:48.581
Arnaldo's isn't closed
in the dimension

20:48.615 --> 20:50.317
where they didn't invent
Daylight Savings!

20:50.350 --> 20:53.152
What would we do without you?
I love you, Dad.

20:53.185 --> 20:54.954
Love you, too, sweetie.

20:56.188 --> 20:57.624
By the way,
that wasn't time travel.

20:57.657 --> 20:59.292
There were just a couple pizzas
on the counter.

20:59.326 --> 21:00.960
I grabbed them.

21:00.993 --> 21:07.099
**

21:07.133 --> 21:13.172
**

21:13.205 --> 21:19.312
**

21:19.346 --> 21:25.652
**

21:25.685 --> 21:31.524
**

21:31.558 --> 21:33.926
Hey, Jerry, it's Kiara.

21:33.960 --> 21:36.496
Listen, my boyfriend saw those
texts you've been sending me,

21:36.529 --> 21:37.964
and he got pretty pissed off.

21:37.997 --> 21:40.266
If he calls you,
just ignore him!

21:40.299 --> 21:41.701
This is Carmox.

21:41.734 --> 21:43.169
I have intercepted
sexual communications

21:43.202 --> 21:45.004
between you and my
new girlfriend, Kiara.

21:45.037 --> 21:47.006
I am coming to kill you now!

21:47.039 --> 21:48.808
Rick:
Yo, Jerry, it's the Big R.

21:48.841 --> 21:50.877
Uh, I killed that alien
that was coming after ya.

21:50.910 --> 21:52.679
Looking out for ya, buddy.

21:52.712 --> 21:54.213
Hey, Jerry, it's Rick.

21:54.246 --> 21:56.015
Don't be mad. I fucked
your ex-girlfriend Kiara.

21:56.048 --> 21:57.384
Kiara: Who are you
talking to, Rick?

21:57.417 --> 21:58.818
Doesn't matter.

21:58.851 --> 22:00.520
Hey, Jerry, this is Michael

22:00.553 --> 22:02.021
down at The Antique Phone
rentals.

22:02.054 --> 22:03.690
Um, I'm gonna go ahead
and let you off the hook

22:03.723 --> 22:05.224
for the $70 late fee.

22:05.257 --> 22:06.793
You can go ahead and keep
that answering machine.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.528
Nobody really uses those anymore

22:08.561 --> 22:10.241
except for exposition
on TV shows, anyways.
