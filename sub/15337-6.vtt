Mmm.

But my superiors are
bending over backwards
for this guy.

It's a matter of

27:47.767 --> 27:49.668
I'm not saying I disagree.

that this guy has more pull
than a tractor.

just doing his job?
Yeah.

28:12.524 --> 28:15.394

of his soldiers out of custody
before he talks.

28:15.427 --> 28:17.730

fueled and ready for liftoff.

at the embassy.

Twenty in the last three years,
including Khalid
and his friends.

You were right.
Khalid's protecting a handler.

Al-Nura's got the money,
the power and the connections.
He's the head of the snake.

28:33.512 --> 28:37.216
Yeah, we're both right.
Al-Nura wouldn't be fighting so
hard if Khalid wasn't involved.

28:37.249 --> 28:39.718
Al-Nura could have dozens
of sleepers like him
already in the country.

28:39.752 --> 28:43.222
If he gets out,
he could do this again
and again and again.

let him get on that plane.

yourself with your victims.

It's a court order
for Khalid's release.

29:24.296 --> 29:27.566
This doesn't cover it.
How so?

29:27.599 --> 29:29.836
Justice needs to
sign off on this,
not some local judge.

29:29.869 --> 29:32.471

of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts.

Police authority maybe.

If he gives up a name,
we get to keep him.

29:45.952 --> 29:48.120
You will release him,

Your friends asked you
for a favor, right?
That's right, isn't it?

30:49.115 --> 30:53.986
Yes.
Many terrorist cells have
a designated fall guy.
