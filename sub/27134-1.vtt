01:16.840 --> 01:18.640
Hey! What's going on?

01:20.170 --> 01:21.460
What's going on? What are you doing?

01:21.880 --> 01:23.580
-Shut up!
-What the--?

01:24.300 --> 01:25.720
Take us to Ibra's cell. Understand?

01:26.590 --> 01:28.430
-Move! Move it!
- Son of a bitch!

01:28.510 --> 01:29.800
Move! Move!

01:29.880 --> 01:31.710
We're here! We're here, Ibra!

01:31.800 --> 01:34.300
We'll get you out, boy! We'll get you out.

01:34.380 --> 01:36.960
Where is he? You're a dead man!

01:37.050 --> 01:38.140
Where is he?

01:38.340 --> 01:39.800
Open the door! Open it!

01:40.260 --> 01:41.180
Open the door!

01:41.460 --> 01:42.380
Come on, open it!

01:42.960 --> 01:46.830
Ibra! Come here, boy, come here.

01:47.710 --> 01:49.210
Did he hurt you?

01:51.010 --> 01:55.010
That's my good boy. My best friend.

01:56.590 --> 02:01.260
There won't be a next time.
You're staying with me, boy. I'm sorry.

02:11.260 --> 02:17.260
THE WORLD IS YOURS

02:30.130 --> 02:31.040
...you know, when you're inside,

02:31.130 --> 02:34.250
it's not like you have access
to the National Library.

02:34.340 --> 02:36.760
I had a cellmate who said the same thing.

02:36.840 --> 02:39.930
Do your time,
keep your head down, you know?

02:40.010 --> 02:43.300
You've been the smartest since childhood.
We had high hopes for you.

02:43.380 --> 02:47.000
I always said to your mother,
"Look at him,

02:47.090 --> 02:49.340
he's going to be the deputy mayor,

02:49.420 --> 02:52.210
or a model, or a guidance counselor,"
you know?

02:52.300 --> 02:53.760
You were a slim good-looking boy.

02:53.840 --> 02:58.390
Now, look at you-- sitting in a car,
watching these assholes.

02:58.460 --> 03:01.540
It reminds me of that song
we used to listen to with your mom--

03:01.880 --> 03:06.290
by that guy with the long hair,
who died in a helicopter accident.

03:07.550 --> 03:09.550
That singer...? Anyway...

03:09.630 --> 03:13.630
"Life Teaches Me Nothing,"
you know?

03:14.050 --> 03:16.970
When you hear that song,
I can tell you...

03:18.210 --> 03:20.580
that singer nailed it.

03:20.670 --> 03:23.880
It's in the words.
Life teaches you nothing.

03:24.420 --> 03:28.250
You have to choose
between being good and--

03:28.340 --> 03:32.140
You think people are good. You can't tell.
It's not written on their foreheads.

03:32.210 --> 03:34.080
You think they're good, then you wonder...

03:34.170 --> 03:36.210
-Show me.
-All of that is in the past.

03:37.550 --> 03:38.640
Like St. Thomas said--

03:38.960 --> 03:40.750
-How much did they say it was?
-50.

03:40.840 --> 03:42.300
They told you it was 50?

03:42.670 --> 03:43.500
Yeah.

03:43.590 --> 03:45.680
...if you don't see it,
you don't believe it.

03:45.760 --> 03:47.510
Did they give you a baggie
with a scratch card?

03:50.340 --> 03:51.180
Like this.

03:55.260 --> 03:56.800
-Go on, get lost.
-"Life...

03:58.170 --> 03:59.540
teaches you nothing."

03:59.630 --> 04:01.380
And then, you let it--

04:01.840 --> 04:02.760
I'll be right back.

05:11.210 --> 05:14.080
-What's up, dude?
-What's that? Is that 50?

05:14.420 --> 05:16.420
Where's the baggie with the weed
and scratch card?

05:16.510 --> 05:18.760
I don't know. Ask Poutine.
We don't give a shit--

05:18.840 --> 05:21.010
-We don't give a shit?
-Stop, Farès.

05:21.260 --> 05:23.220
Didn't I explain about our competition?

05:23.300 --> 05:24.840
I don't know. That's what Poutine said.

05:25.010 --> 05:27.090
Yeah. He said
he wanted to see you as well.

05:27.760 --> 05:28.720
What'd you say?

05:31.090 --> 05:32.090
He wants to see you.

05:32.550 --> 05:34.090
We're just doing our job.

05:45.090 --> 05:47.390
Hello? Stéphane Manzin,
the newspaper guy?

05:47.460 --> 05:49.920
Shut your mouth.
Don't talk, just listen.

05:50.010 --> 05:52.970
I want all the dogs freed
from the pound in Stains. Okay?

05:53.380 --> 05:54.290
Listen to me.

05:54.550 --> 05:56.090
If they touch my dog one more time,

05:56.170 --> 05:58.040
I'll grab your kids and you're all fucked!

05:58.130 --> 06:00.790
I got nothing to lose.
Did you write that down?

06:00.960 --> 06:03.130
Well, fuck you then! There.

06:03.380 --> 06:05.710
There. Fucking hell.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.720
The amount of hash they sell is too small.

06:08.800 --> 06:10.260
"But she's got long hair!"

06:10.800 --> 06:11.970
Buyers notice and we lose them.

06:12.380 --> 06:13.420
Are you listening?

06:13.510 --> 06:16.760
Same thing with the gift baggies.
We started that with Tarek and did well.

06:16.840 --> 06:17.970
Why are you talking about Tarek?

06:18.760 --> 06:20.300
He's fucking busted.

06:21.050 --> 06:24.010
It's a war. He's talking about gift bags.
Fucking Kinder Surprise.

06:24.090 --> 06:26.640
Didn't I tell you
I was done with that shit?

06:28.010 --> 06:28.970
-Yeah.
-Yes or no?

06:29.050 --> 06:30.220
-Yeah.
-Yes or no?

06:31.090 --> 06:32.890
-Yes.
-There you go.

06:34.460 --> 06:36.080
I don't give a shit.

06:38.380 --> 06:40.500
Sit down. I need to talk to you.

06:41.010 --> 06:43.260
Come on, sit.
That's not why I wanted to see you.

06:43.340 --> 06:45.180
Come here, come on.

06:45.550 --> 06:46.390
Closer.

06:48.300 --> 06:49.180
Closer.

06:50.260 --> 06:53.260
We're gonna bring product from Spain.

06:53.590 --> 06:55.640
I need someone to bring it here.

06:55.880 --> 06:58.250
I want it to be you.

06:59.010 --> 07:00.590
-You've got a supplier?
-Yeah.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.880
-The Scotsman.
-You know the Scotsman?

07:02.960 --> 07:06.460
No, you do. Hey. Strike one.

07:07.800 --> 07:10.300
The Scotsman is Tarek's guy.
You talk to him.

07:10.460 --> 07:13.000
Hey. Hey. Strike two. Watch it!

07:13.090 --> 07:15.300
-What'd you say?
-You should talk to him.

07:16.010 --> 07:19.050
Shut the fuck up.
Son of a bitch, get back here!

07:26.920 --> 07:28.210
See what you made me do?

07:28.550 --> 07:31.010
Ibra, I'm sorry. Sorry, boy.

07:32.510 --> 07:36.010
I'm sorry. Stop it, it's-- See?

07:36.260 --> 07:37.090
Hey.

07:37.170 --> 07:39.420
Don't talk to me about Tarek, understand?

07:40.460 --> 07:43.330
I've never transported hash.
I don't want to do it.

07:43.420 --> 07:45.040
-You don't want to play ball anymore?
-No.

07:45.130 --> 07:47.540
We can play dirty, too.

07:48.210 --> 07:50.210
We'll put you on the bench. Get me?

07:51.670 --> 07:53.500
I don't give a shit. Okay?

07:53.800 --> 07:56.300
'Cause if one of my guys--

07:57.090 --> 07:58.760
if one of the guys--

07:59.550 --> 08:01.510
If one of my guys won't cooperate...

08:10.380 --> 08:11.210
Get out of here.

08:13.510 --> 08:14.720
Go look after the babies. Get out.

08:15.170 --> 08:16.170
Only real men are here.

08:57.590 --> 09:00.260
Do you really think
you can trust these people?

09:00.340 --> 09:01.180
Of course.

09:01.260 --> 09:05.140
Your lawyer, that Jewish guy,
knows some sketchy people.

09:05.210 --> 09:07.080
-He's not Jewish, he's Iranian.
-Same thing.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.500
Just 'cause he comes from a nice family,
doesn't mean he's a good guy.

09:11.050 --> 09:11.890
Be careful.

09:13.840 --> 09:14.720
All right.

09:19.380 --> 09:20.670
I'm coming with you.

09:21.510 --> 09:24.680
He won't try and screw me over.
It has to go well.

09:25.050 --> 09:26.800
Don't start. I need to concentrate.

09:27.670 --> 09:31.880
That shirt doesn't suit you at all.
It's way too small.

09:37.380 --> 09:38.210
Here.

09:40.300 --> 09:43.220
Burberry's winter collection.
They do big sizes.

09:44.340 --> 09:45.930
Bigger is better, right?

09:46.010 --> 09:49.050
Less suspicious, no smoke and mirrors.

09:51.590 --> 09:52.800
He's not ready.

09:53.710 --> 09:55.000
Aren't you gonna let him in?

09:55.090 --> 09:58.430
He did 12 years in prison.
He can wait another 15 minutes outside.

10:02.420 --> 10:05.580
Your little girlfriend
will be surprised to see you again.

10:06.170 --> 10:08.290
-Didn't you know she was back?
-Who?

10:08.380 --> 10:10.880
Lamya. She's back.

10:11.300 --> 10:13.010
So? She's just a kid.

10:13.090 --> 10:16.260
Yeah, she's a kid,
but you stalk her on Facebook.

10:16.550 --> 10:17.800
That's not true.

10:18.960 --> 10:20.710
You think I don't notice?

10:20.840 --> 10:24.760
I know everything.
I'm your mother, François.

10:25.800 --> 10:29.090
Do you want me to talk to her?
Get you a date?

10:29.170 --> 10:31.750
-Stop it!
-Now's the time to get her.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.970
Kamel's parading her around,
but soon she'll be grown.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.180
She'll have other opportunities,
other ambitions

10:36.260 --> 10:37.800
and then it'll be too late.

10:37.880 --> 10:40.210
Give me a break. You talk all the time.
What's the point?

10:42.880 --> 10:44.380
This is what you should say.

10:45.010 --> 10:48.050
"You're all here
because you all have a sense of humanity.

10:48.130 --> 10:51.540
So, look me in the eyes
and ask yourselves if you can trust me.

10:51.630 --> 10:53.040
Go with your gut."

10:54.010 --> 10:55.800
Then, boom! Screw 'em good.

10:56.170 --> 10:58.790
I won't be screwing anyone.
See you later, Mom.

11:30.260 --> 11:32.140
<i>With us, you have peace of mind.</i>

11:32.210 --> 11:34.710
<i>Our biggest advantage</i>
<i>is understanding local habits and customs.</i>

11:35.340 --> 11:37.590
<i>We are also fluent</i>
<i>in Arabic, French and English.</i>

11:37.670 --> 11:39.170
Come on, let's go!

11:39.260 --> 11:42.720
<i>Transport will be outsourced</i>
<i>to a local partner</i>

11:42.800 --> 11:45.090
<i>for delivery throughout the country,</i>

11:45.170 --> 11:47.040
<i>and hopefully soon all of North Africa.</i>

11:47.760 --> 11:49.220
<i>We see an opportunity for us,</i>

11:50.130 --> 11:52.790
<i>an unprecedented opportunity</i>
<i>for your franchise,</i>

11:53.510 --> 11:56.720
<i>and, of course, for 34 million</i>
<i>Moroccan consumers.</i>

12:00.760 --> 12:02.430
Details are in the brochure.

12:06.090 --> 12:10.050
It's a great presentation, but,
to be honest, we've had better offers.

12:12.840 --> 12:14.590
Are you sure about these numbers?

12:17.210 --> 12:19.040
You know, numbers,

12:19.880 --> 12:21.080
what exactly are numbers?

12:21.170 --> 12:22.710
They're an abstract concept.

12:22.800 --> 12:27.010
Yes, as my lawyer was saying,
I can match the competition.

12:27.130 --> 12:29.630
Go into debt, overpay the franchise,
crash in two years

12:29.710 --> 12:31.790
and file for bankruptcy.
You're left with a discredited brand

12:31.880 --> 12:34.040
and a closed market.
I prefer to pay the right price today

12:34.130 --> 12:35.250
and guarantee long-term profits.

12:35.760 --> 12:38.090
I'm not here to play games, Mr. Lhermitte.

12:45.130 --> 12:45.960
Well...

12:48.340 --> 12:50.260
Just one more thing.

13:07.050 --> 13:09.470
Get out of the way! Son of a bitch.

13:09.550 --> 13:11.840
"Just one more thing. <i>Inshallah."</i>

13:11.920 --> 13:14.750
Help yourselves to water.

13:19.050 --> 13:21.760
Close the deal as soon as possible
and send the dough.

13:21.840 --> 13:23.720
Can't wait for competition to get wind.

13:24.010 --> 13:26.510
Okay. I'll speak to my mother
and it'll be done next week.

13:27.920 --> 13:30.380
-Your mother has the money?
-What is your problem?

13:30.460 --> 13:31.330
Yeah.

13:31.420 --> 13:32.830
That's right, shut your mouth.

13:32.920 --> 13:35.580
Excuse me, sir.
Do you have a favorite radio station?

13:40.800 --> 13:44.300
Check out the usual suspects.
They're my clients from Zaire.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.800
They rob the robbers
and steal from the thieves.

13:46.880 --> 13:49.710
-Unbelievable.
-I don't know how you stand them.

13:49.800 --> 13:52.840
Oh, I like them a lot.

13:58.170 --> 14:02.710
Look at them-- wannabe Robin Hoods.
The Judge thinks it's hilarious.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.220
-Morning, sir.
-Morning, Mr. Dembélé.

14:06.300 --> 14:07.720
-How are you?
-Nice suit,

14:07.800 --> 14:10.760
-but I asked you to come alone.
-Never mind.

14:10.840 --> 14:12.930
Don't you work with Tarek?
Isn't he in the clink?

14:13.960 --> 14:15.170
We should talk.

14:15.630 --> 14:19.000
Sorry, Albert. You're too late.
Mr. Farès has just retired.

14:19.800 --> 14:22.260
About the money--
next week at the latest.

14:22.340 --> 14:23.260
-Sure.
-At the latest.

14:23.340 --> 14:24.640
I'm going to see Mother now at work.

14:25.210 --> 14:30.710
Well, let's go then, come on.
Please, come on, let's go. Thank you.

14:30.800 --> 14:34.390
Come on, come on, gentlemen.
They're waiting for us.

15:11.760 --> 15:12.640
Mom.

15:14.670 --> 15:15.500
Mom.

15:16.460 --> 15:19.500
Mom. Hold on, it's urgent.
I need to speak to you.

15:21.460 --> 15:22.630
Wait, Mom.

15:26.300 --> 15:27.760
Hello, handsome.

15:27.840 --> 15:28.840
Lamya?

15:29.300 --> 15:32.140
So, you're back then?
How are you? You look--

15:32.630 --> 15:35.380
-Young man, what are you doing?
-No. Mom, please.

15:35.460 --> 15:37.250
-What's gotten into you?
-Stop it.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.920
-I'm not going to the station for hours.
-Help!

15:40.010 --> 15:42.470
-Help! Security!
-Mom, this isn't the time.

15:42.550 --> 15:44.300
Mom, please.
I'll be stuck for two hours.

15:44.380 --> 15:47.000
-Is there any security in this place?
-What's going on?

15:47.090 --> 15:48.970
-He's stealing from me.
-What's going on here?

15:49.050 --> 15:52.010
-This slut's accusing me.
-Okay sir, you have to calm down.

15:52.090 --> 15:54.390
Hey! I shop at Louis Vuitton.
What's the problem?

15:54.460 --> 15:55.330
-Okay, sure, let's go.
-Come on, let's go.

15:55.420 --> 15:57.710
-Let go, I'm a pacifist.
-Come on, calm down.

15:57.800 --> 16:00.260
-Calm down.
-Hey! That's Burberry!

16:00.340 --> 16:02.300
This is harassment! Film this!

16:03.050 --> 16:04.930
You can't do this to me.
You get that!

16:05.460 --> 16:08.000
If I wanted your stupid store,
I'd just buy it.

16:08.090 --> 16:09.510
-Come on, let's go,
-On my mother's life,

16:09.590 --> 16:11.430
I know all about those skanks.

16:42.550 --> 16:45.840
Hey, bitch, you getting in? Come on!

16:54.010 --> 16:56.680
Mom, I didn't come for that.
I'm not 12 anymore.

16:56.760 --> 16:59.140
-Put your seat belt on.
-Eight scarves.

16:59.510 --> 17:02.840
-Gucci, Céline, Prada...
-Mom!

17:02.920 --> 17:04.670
I need to make that withdrawal
for my project.

17:04.760 --> 17:08.010
-What project is that?
-To open a Mr. Pim’s in Tunisia.

17:08.710 --> 17:11.750
No, I want to develop the Mr. Freeze
franchise in North Africa.

17:11.840 --> 17:13.140
I told you to put on your seat belt.

17:13.210 --> 17:16.630
But the meeting went really well.
I just need 80,000 euros to close the--

17:19.420 --> 17:21.250
I asked you several times--
put your seat belt on.

17:21.670 --> 17:23.580
Your savings are safe where they are.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.210
I don't want you throwing away
our capital for a scam.

17:26.300 --> 17:27.840
What do you mean "our capital"?
It's mine.

17:27.920 --> 17:30.380
Because there's a difference
between us now?

17:30.550 --> 17:32.930
Are you saying I'm a bad money manager?

17:33.510 --> 17:36.050
We agreed that money was
for a house in Saint-Rémy-lès-Chevreuse.

17:36.130 --> 17:37.790
That's your thing, not mine.

17:37.880 --> 17:40.880
You're gonna go from being
a two-bit dealer to a CEO, just like that?

17:41.340 --> 17:43.300
Who's gonna manage your company?

17:43.960 --> 17:45.080
Henri?

17:47.210 --> 17:48.290
Henri.

17:55.630 --> 17:57.750
You don't know what you want.
That's your problem.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.390
First you want to be a baker,
then, a fireman--

17:59.460 --> 18:00.790
When I was eight years old!

18:00.880 --> 18:04.630
Now you want to sell Mr. Freeze.
Your plan has to be structured.

18:04.800 --> 18:08.890
You can't just rush into any old thing
just because you feel like it.

18:10.170 --> 18:11.250
Where's the stash, Mom?

18:14.420 --> 18:17.170
If I tell everyone where it is,
it's not a stash anymore.

18:18.210 --> 18:20.630
You haven't lost my savings, have you?

18:21.380 --> 18:23.380
You didn't blow my 80,000 euros
at the casino, did you?

18:23.460 --> 18:24.500
Who do you think you're talking to?

18:24.590 --> 18:28.010
Do you think I'm incapable of looking
after our money? Your own mother?

18:28.300 --> 18:30.050
I fed and clothed you,

18:30.130 --> 18:33.130
even though I could have left you
on the steps of a church

18:33.210 --> 18:35.630
and you would've become a pedophile.

18:35.710 --> 18:37.920
Motherfucker!

18:41.760 --> 18:43.550
That's all right. It's okay.

18:45.800 --> 18:47.140
Use your anger.

18:48.130 --> 18:51.580
It'll give you meaning.
It'll do you good, you need it.

18:55.920 --> 18:59.380
I do this for your own good.
I know you, you'll just get screwed over

18:59.460 --> 19:01.500
if you jump in without thinking.

19:01.590 --> 19:03.720
Especially in North Africa,
it's full of Arabs.

19:11.170 --> 19:15.920
Do you... want to go get
a slice of cake?

19:17.840 --> 19:20.470
A pistachio éclair, your favorite.

19:59.880 --> 20:03.630
<i>A cliff side and a bird of prey,</i>
<i>the peregrine falcon.</i>

20:04.460 --> 20:10.040
<i>The female distributes food to her brood.</i>
<i>It is an important job...</i>

20:16.670 --> 20:19.580
Okay. My idea is to do it
with two cars, one prepped out.

20:19.670 --> 20:23.170
We take a girl to clear customs, do it
on the down low over three days. Done.

20:31.130 --> 20:33.960
If you want me to take care of it,
I do it my way. Not in a convoy.

20:34.050 --> 20:38.340
-And I want 100 thou from the margin.
-100,000? Hey! You're cocky.

20:38.550 --> 20:41.970
Watch it, okay? Watch it!

20:43.170 --> 20:44.880
If I find a kid,
he'll do it for five grand.

20:44.960 --> 20:46.920
What? I swear on the Quran,
I'll do it for four.

20:47.010 --> 20:49.220
Four? Bullshit, are you stupid?
I'd do it for three. Idiot.

20:49.300 --> 20:53.300
-Shut the fuck up!
-Dude, you're a fucking idiot.

20:53.380 --> 20:56.040
Shut up. Shut the fuck up.

20:57.710 --> 20:59.500
How are you going to get to the Scotsman?
With those guys?

20:59.590 --> 21:02.340
He trusts me, he knows me through Tarek.
If there's no trust, you'll get nothing.

21:02.420 --> 21:03.750
Hold on, let me think.

21:04.590 --> 21:05.430
Hey, Poutine.

21:05.710 --> 21:07.500
The Scotsman
is the only supplier with a boat.

21:07.590 --> 21:09.090
He'll chew you up and spit you out.

21:10.800 --> 21:14.050
Okay, but you're taking Mohamed
and Mohamed with you? Okay?

21:16.050 --> 21:16.890
Okay.

21:20.590 --> 21:21.970
Are my fingers red?

21:23.710 --> 21:25.670
-Did I make my fingers red?
-No.

21:27.460 --> 21:32.750
Ten grand to prep the car, right?
And you're gonna pay for all that shit.

21:33.010 --> 21:34.340
Where can I get ten grand?

21:34.420 --> 21:37.040
I don't know, maybe ask your mother.

21:43.210 --> 21:46.040
<i>In a few days, her little ones</i>
<i>will have to cope on their own.</i>

21:46.130 --> 21:48.830
Hey, one day I'll have two eagles.

21:49.380 --> 21:52.040
-In your dreams.
-What do you mean, dude?

21:52.300 --> 21:54.890
You always shit on my dreams.
Don't you have some?

21:55.880 --> 21:58.330
I don't have lame-ass ones like yours.

21:59.260 --> 22:02.970
In any case, money...
cash is just going to disappear.

22:03.210 --> 22:05.460
Nowadays, 80 percent
of the world's transactions

22:05.550 --> 22:07.470
are not made in cash.

22:07.550 --> 22:11.180
It's all zeros and ones on computers.
That's how people pay.

22:11.260 --> 22:12.640
Furthermore,
we shouldn't use paper anymore.

22:12.710 --> 22:16.710
When you think about it, what is paper?
It's, well, trees and trees are life.

22:17.130 --> 22:18.670
And life-- that's us.

22:19.510 --> 22:22.970
Even roadmaps are over.
It's all about GPS now.

22:23.050 --> 22:26.180
Rolling paper-- people are vaping.

22:26.960 --> 22:28.710
Look around. No paper anywhere.

22:28.800 --> 22:31.180
That's not even real wallpaper.
It's plastic, even here.

22:32.050 --> 22:35.430
Hey. Hold on, girls.
Have you noticed something different?

22:35.510 --> 22:37.640
-My nose is slimmer.
-Did you go to Dr. Sebah?

22:37.710 --> 22:40.130
No. I do nasal workouts.

22:41.630 --> 22:43.960
Stop laughing. Listen to me.

22:44.050 --> 22:47.720
-You contract the muscles and that--
-How is that possible?

22:48.340 --> 22:50.930
-Five minutes, every day.
-Is that it?

22:51.010 --> 22:52.550
You can't. You won't be able to.

22:55.670 --> 22:56.500
That's bullshit.

22:59.630 --> 23:01.670
Mom, I'm not asking for it all,
I need ten grand.

23:02.130 --> 23:03.330
Greet your aunties.

23:03.420 --> 23:04.880
Mom, please, I'm serious.

23:05.630 --> 23:08.170
-Let's go. Come on.
-No. No.

23:10.380 --> 23:11.960
Come say hello to your aunties.

23:12.380 --> 23:16.080
-Oh, François.
-Rascal, aren't you speaking to us?

23:16.170 --> 23:18.710
-Put on weight, hasn't he?
-Yeah, a little pot belly.

23:18.800 --> 23:20.390
-He looks fine.
-Tell me--

23:20.460 --> 23:22.330
you're going to sell ice cream
on the beach in Morocco?

23:22.420 --> 23:23.500
Big shot!

23:23.880 --> 23:26.290
Do the fat belly dance,
like when you were little.

23:26.380 --> 23:27.500
Oh, yeah.

23:27.590 --> 23:29.260
No, I don't feel well.

23:29.760 --> 23:33.090
Dance, François! Dance!

23:33.170 --> 23:34.080
Go on, François.

23:35.590 --> 23:37.390
Go, go, go!

23:37.460 --> 23:39.040
Put on the song.

23:41.170 --> 23:42.380
Go on, go on!

23:52.420 --> 23:53.960
He's so cute!

24:59.800 --> 25:00.930
So cute!

25:03.710 --> 25:05.960
So, how's the Mr. Freeze thing going?

25:09.300 --> 25:11.180
Yeah, I have to go to Spain.

25:11.590 --> 25:13.890
What for?
You gonna sell them your chorizo?

25:16.420 --> 25:18.210
Sorry, that cracked me up.

25:18.420 --> 25:19.290
Want to come?

25:25.590 --> 25:28.090
I need a girl to come with me
to set it all up.

25:29.300 --> 25:31.300
You'll get a nice apartment.
There's something in it for you.

25:33.300 --> 25:35.090
And you think I need the money?

25:35.170 --> 25:36.960
You work with my mom, so...

25:37.050 --> 25:39.970
So what? She makes me laugh, that's all.
I'm not a hooker.

25:40.760 --> 25:42.550
It's not a sex deal.
You don't have to do anything.

25:42.630 --> 25:45.920
Hey, don't get cocky.
I like you, but that's it.

25:46.010 --> 25:48.260
This is just for fun.
I'm not on the streets.

25:51.300 --> 25:53.010
Anyway, I'm still in contact with Kamel.

26:05.710 --> 26:07.710
Your girlfriend is...

26:09.260 --> 26:10.890
So, can you help me or not?

26:11.300 --> 26:12.300
Please.

26:15.670 --> 26:17.710
Aren't you a bit old
to be asking for money?

26:22.590 --> 26:24.470
I won't always be here to help you out.

26:37.880 --> 26:40.170
The idea is that we're cops. But corrupt.

26:40.260 --> 26:42.390
So we have to behave
a bit like thugs, get it?

26:45.340 --> 26:46.180
What?

26:48.550 --> 26:52.140
We're fake cops?

26:52.760 --> 26:54.090
Real cops. But crooked.

26:54.380 --> 26:56.830
We want them to think
they've been robbed by real cops.

27:00.260 --> 27:02.840
Okay. But those are fake guns?

27:03.130 --> 27:07.630
No, real guns. They just aren't loaded.

27:08.760 --> 27:09.590
That's it.

27:10.880 --> 27:12.540
Well, it's kinda like they're fake.

27:12.840 --> 27:14.140
-Okay.
-Understand?

27:14.210 --> 27:16.580
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.
-Cool. Let's roll.

27:19.670 --> 27:24.040
And when you say we're real cops,
we're not really real cops?

27:25.380 --> 27:29.630
And you're not a real cop, are you?

27:30.460 --> 27:33.130
-'Course not.
-Okay, 'cause...

27:33.420 --> 27:36.630
we had this friend who was really a cop.
We didn't know.

27:36.710 --> 27:39.210
And I can tell you
that was a problem, you know?

27:41.550 --> 27:43.510
I'm not a cop.
You've known me since I was little.

27:43.590 --> 27:44.470
Okay.

27:44.960 --> 27:46.500
All right then, let's go.

28:04.920 --> 28:05.880
It'll be fine.

28:18.090 --> 28:19.840
Give me my money.

28:23.170 --> 28:24.210
Police!

28:25.840 --> 28:27.390
-Yes, sir?
-Police, open up.

28:27.460 --> 28:29.130
-We're closed, sir.
-Shut your mouth.

28:29.210 --> 28:30.830
-There's nobody here.
-Nobody here, my ass.

28:32.050 --> 28:33.050
Nobody, eh?

28:38.590 --> 28:39.590
Fuck, your mom's here.

28:40.380 --> 28:42.250
-Your mom's over there.
-I know. I'll take care of it.

28:42.340 --> 28:44.090
What do you mean?
We can't rob your mother!

28:44.170 --> 28:45.000
Police!

28:45.300 --> 28:48.090
Police! Nobody moves! Police!

28:48.170 --> 28:49.540
Everybody shut the fuck up!

28:50.170 --> 28:52.330
Come on, hands on heads!
Police, for fuck's sake!

28:52.420 --> 28:54.420
Nobody move.
Hands on the table. All of you!

28:54.510 --> 28:56.180
-We're not fucking around.
-Bag the evidence.

28:56.260 --> 28:58.640
Everything will be fine. Stay calm.

28:58.710 --> 29:01.080
-Cooperate and no one gets hurt.
-Immigration papers. We'll deport you all.

29:01.170 --> 29:02.130
What's he doing, Danny?
Are you in on this?

29:02.210 --> 29:03.670
-No.
-Don't panic. Okay?

29:03.760 --> 29:06.390
-Nobody move! All right?
-Don't panic, follow our instructions!

29:06.590 --> 29:09.260
-Nobody moves, okay?
-You're not cop. Not cop.

29:09.340 --> 29:10.840
-What's she saying?
-You're not a cop.

29:10.920 --> 29:12.920
-Yes, I am!
- You're not a cop. It's fake!

29:13.010 --> 29:14.760
-What's that then?
-Not police.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.760
-I am the police.
-No, I know cops.

29:16.840 --> 29:18.180
-They're fake.
-Hey, don't touch me.

29:18.260 --> 29:19.640
I'm-- can't you read?

29:19.840 --> 29:21.890
-I can read. It's a fake.
-It's not fake, I'm a cop!

29:21.960 --> 29:22.830
It's fake.

29:22.920 --> 29:25.250
François, if you're doing this,
be very careful.

29:25.340 --> 29:27.970
-I am a police officer!
-You not police! They're fake.

29:28.050 --> 29:29.760
-Hey! Sit down!
-No.

29:30.380 --> 29:32.460
Go on, get lost! Get out!

29:33.170 --> 29:35.250
I'm the boss here. Get out!

29:35.340 --> 29:38.010
-I'm--
-Not police! They're fake.

29:41.960 --> 29:43.000
Officer!

29:43.090 --> 29:45.090
Evacuate! Come on, back to the car.

29:45.170 --> 29:48.330
Motherfucker! He hit me!

29:48.420 --> 29:49.830
Did you tell them where we were?

29:50.760 --> 29:52.470
Motherfucker!

29:53.670 --> 29:54.710
Motherfucker!

30:09.340 --> 30:11.010
We're a bit short. We'll have to barter.

30:11.710 --> 30:13.290
Do you know this mechanic?

30:15.800 --> 30:16.640
Henri!

30:17.420 --> 30:19.210
What? You didn't warn me
about your mother.

30:19.300 --> 30:20.680
I lost my cool!

30:20.760 --> 30:24.260
-Never mind! So, this mechanic?
-She'll think I--

30:24.340 --> 30:26.390
Let it go! She used you
when my dad fucked off.

30:26.460 --> 30:28.080
You got locked up.
She treated you like shit!

30:29.090 --> 30:31.140
For fuck's sake, forget about her!
Move on.

30:43.670 --> 30:48.130
I know him well, the mechanic.
I can get us a discount if you want.

30:57.050 --> 30:59.390
Right, well, you did good tonight.

31:02.960 --> 31:05.380
After Spain, you've definitely earned
your camper van.

31:09.380 --> 31:12.000
"Not police, not police, it's a fake."

31:14.210 --> 31:16.880
Your mom's looking for you
to give you a good spanking.

31:17.340 --> 31:19.680
I wouldn't advise
going to her place tonight.

31:19.760 --> 31:21.010
Not part of the plan.

31:22.420 --> 31:25.080
The Chinese guy thought she was with you,
so they had a fight.

31:26.130 --> 31:28.460
And so I took this in passing.

31:32.550 --> 31:35.180
Treated me like shit...

31:35.590 --> 31:37.260
It's not easy for her either, you know.

31:38.340 --> 31:39.430
It's easy to judge.

31:39.510 --> 31:41.090
You're gonna drink with me?

31:41.760 --> 31:44.550
We got into a fight
about the money she owes me.

31:44.630 --> 31:46.540
"We have to share our losses,"
shit like that.

31:46.920 --> 31:48.670
You think we should share the profits?

31:50.050 --> 31:51.640
If that's what you've come for,
I don't have anything.

31:55.050 --> 31:58.050
What's the story then?
That Mr. Freeze scam?

31:58.300 --> 31:59.640
It's not a scam.

32:00.550 --> 32:02.430
Forget it. You don't understand.

32:02.670 --> 32:04.000
Go on, tell me.

32:04.340 --> 32:07.640
You're not interested.
There's no champagne magnum, no Ferrari.

32:08.710 --> 32:13.330
It's just a normal life.
A simple job, a little house.

32:13.710 --> 32:15.000
And a pool, that's all.

32:15.090 --> 32:17.550
Oh, a pool? Could be worse.

32:18.260 --> 32:22.800
Yeah. A pool 25 feet long.
You wanna see?

32:23.130 --> 32:23.960
Yeah.

32:26.050 --> 32:29.430
Look. Okay, it's just a 3D plan but--

32:30.260 --> 32:32.180
Look. There.

32:32.510 --> 32:33.970
I think it's gonna be great.

32:35.760 --> 32:37.090
Oh, yeah.

32:39.670 --> 32:40.750
What's that?

32:42.590 --> 32:43.510
It's a peacock.

32:44.420 --> 32:46.420
Peacocks in the garden.

32:49.130 --> 32:51.330
Did you find a girl to go with you?

32:52.340 --> 32:53.390
Not yet.

32:54.710 --> 32:56.210
It's in Spain, right?

32:57.210 --> 32:58.080
Yeah.

33:01.420 --> 33:02.750
Invitation still stand?

33:04.510 --> 33:05.840
What about Kamel?

33:06.050 --> 33:08.590
Kamel can wait.
I need a break from your mother.

34:17.130 --> 34:21.920
<i>The Illuminati are a secret society</i>
<i>that control us. It is the most ancient...</i>

34:22.010 --> 34:25.050
See? That's what we meant. It's them.

34:25.130 --> 34:28.080
-They want you to be exactly as you are.
-Everything's connected.

34:28.380 --> 34:29.290
That's the Illuminati.

34:29.710 --> 34:31.580
They use a technique called chemtrails.

34:31.670 --> 34:33.500
Airplanes leave them behind--

34:33.590 --> 34:36.550
the white stuff that comes out--
gives off chemicals which we breathe in.

34:36.630 --> 34:38.750
That's how they force us
to do their bidding.

34:38.840 --> 34:41.640
-That's not all, Mo! That's not all.
-It's true.

34:41.710 --> 34:44.130
The planes that fly north to south,
east to west,

34:44.210 --> 34:46.500
what do you think they're doing?
U-turns in the sky.

34:46.590 --> 34:49.390
They leave these triangles behind.
American Airlines leaves two,

34:49.460 --> 34:51.790
they even do double triangles,
they're so into it.

34:51.880 --> 34:55.960
Air France is the same.
That's why we do what we want.

34:56.760 --> 34:58.760
That's why we do what we want.

34:59.300 --> 35:00.140
Get it?

35:00.840 --> 35:03.640
<i>-It sends shivers down my spine.</i>
-Triangles in the air we can't see.

35:03.710 --> 35:05.210
But the Illuminati, they can.

35:05.300 --> 35:08.640
-We can't 'cause we aren't one of them.
-Totally.

35:15.590 --> 35:16.970
SCOTSMAN

35:42.960 --> 35:45.460
-What are you doing?
-Wait, wait, I'm almost in.

35:45.590 --> 35:47.470
Are you fucking with me, doing this now?

35:52.460 --> 35:54.420
Close enough?

35:54.510 --> 35:56.300
Give it a rest. Come on.

35:56.550 --> 35:57.390
Come on!

35:58.630 --> 36:00.920
-Don't touch me!
-Why you running, bro?

36:01.010 --> 36:02.970
Come here! Are you a chicken?

36:03.340 --> 36:05.010
-Come on, come here!
-Okay, it's fine!

36:05.090 --> 36:07.550
When did you get to be so uptight?

36:08.210 --> 36:10.130
You used to be fun.

36:10.960 --> 36:14.540
You've thought up some weird alter-ego
for yourself, I don't get it.

36:14.630 --> 36:16.000
I'm not on holiday.

36:18.630 --> 36:19.880
Boring.

36:21.130 --> 36:23.130
You talk like those Instagram girls.

36:24.590 --> 36:26.470
You must have a lot of fun with Kamel.

36:45.960 --> 36:46.830
What's up?

36:49.460 --> 36:51.330
Actually, I haven't heard from Kamel.

36:55.130 --> 36:57.880
We were in Indonesia and he left me.

37:02.800 --> 37:04.890
I've got no money, I'm all alone.

37:38.050 --> 37:41.470
If you want to do it, we can.
But it'll cost you 500.

37:47.510 --> 37:48.680
Are you serious?

37:50.510 --> 37:51.760
What are you gonna do?

38:07.550 --> 38:09.680
-Check this out.
-Wait, let me get that.

38:12.260 --> 38:14.340
-It's our little secret.
-See.

38:14.760 --> 38:16.300
Just in case things heat up.

38:16.510 --> 38:17.890
Okay. Right.

38:17.960 --> 38:19.000
Want a closer look?

38:19.090 --> 38:20.680
I've got something even better. Look.

38:21.210 --> 38:22.790
We're gonna go to Iraq with that.

38:23.420 --> 38:24.710
We'll have a blast, man.

38:27.380 --> 38:28.580
So, are we ready or not?

38:29.380 --> 38:30.500
Freeloader.

39:07.510 --> 39:10.640
I swear, on my mother's life,
I'd never turn myself in.

39:10.710 --> 39:13.790
-You're nuts.
-Stop saying that.

39:16.800 --> 39:17.890
Where are you going?

39:17.960 --> 39:19.630
To see a friend at the hotel.

39:19.710 --> 39:21.420
-Farès said to stick together.
-I won't be long.

39:21.510 --> 39:22.510
Where you going?

39:22.590 --> 39:23.800
-Where you going?
-I'll be right back!

39:31.050 --> 39:31.890
Hey!

39:36.170 --> 39:37.130
Don't move!

39:38.630 --> 39:39.460
Don't move!

39:39.880 --> 39:41.500
-Don't move!
-Get out of the way!

39:41.590 --> 39:42.970
-Out of the way!
-Shut up!

39:43.050 --> 39:45.890
-Get off me! Let me go!
-Come here, stupid bitch!

39:45.960 --> 39:48.080
Calm down! Calm down, I said!

39:48.340 --> 39:49.800
Cool. It's cool.

39:49.880 --> 39:51.250
What's wrong?

39:53.960 --> 39:55.710
Stop her, she's going down!

39:55.800 --> 39:57.430
Here, you son of a bitch!

39:58.960 --> 40:01.170
You bitch! Dirty slut!

40:01.260 --> 40:03.140
Move it! Fuck off!

40:05.420 --> 40:07.170
Calm down, it's all good.

40:20.090 --> 40:22.590
<i>Fire, symbol of the Illuminati.</i>

40:23.510 --> 40:27.890
<i>If you look for it,</i>
<i>you can see it absolutely everywhere.</i>

40:28.260 --> 40:31.930
<i>On our children's toys,</i>
<i>in our sports cars, etc.</i>

40:41.090 --> 40:42.300
Why did you do it?

40:46.760 --> 40:48.300
Why did you pay me?

40:55.800 --> 40:57.010
It's them, stay here.

41:00.050 --> 41:01.510
<i>Actors, singers...</i>

41:01.590 --> 41:03.340
Shut up and let me do the talking.

41:03.420 --> 41:08.420
<i>...politicians, police officers,</i>
<i>high-ranking military officials, etc.</i>

41:08.510 --> 41:13.510
<i>All of them are Luciferians</i>
<i>who practice a very powerful...</i>

41:13.590 --> 41:16.970
<i>Men who make up...</i>

41:17.050 --> 41:19.340
-Farid?
-Farès.

41:35.460 --> 41:38.210
<i>A grain of sand could bring</i>
<i>everything to a halt in a few hours</i>

41:38.300 --> 41:42.090
<i>and the world would stop because,</i>
<i>without money, there's nothing we can do.</i>

41:42.590 --> 41:45.140
<i>...war and the military...</i>

42:00.590 --> 42:02.430
<i>Civil war, financial war...</i>

42:16.630 --> 42:19.380
<i>All this for a radical extermination</i>
<i>of the population.</i>

42:48.380 --> 42:50.170
-What's he saying?
-Quiet.

42:52.670 --> 42:54.250
Hey, what's he been saying?

42:54.340 --> 42:55.340
Shut up.

43:15.760 --> 43:18.640
<i>The creation of a world without God.</i>
<i>Where Christianity would be...</i>

43:31.710 --> 43:32.960
<i>...of the Christian society.</i>

44:15.260 --> 44:16.970
-You're letting him go?
-Are you serious?

44:17.050 --> 44:19.180
-What's that about?
-Hey!

44:19.260 --> 44:20.390
Leave it. Hey, hey! Get out of my face.
We're not in <i>Scarface.</i>

44:20.460 --> 44:23.330
-What do you mean?
-That's how he did it with Tarek!

44:23.670 --> 44:26.500
-We aren't Tarek!
-They'll be back in an hour.

44:28.260 --> 44:29.390
When did he say that?

44:30.260 --> 44:33.640
<i>...disappearance of a god</i>
<i>and fake wars, etc.</i>

44:33.710 --> 44:35.380
<i>From 2010 to 2012, in just two years,</i>

44:35.460 --> 44:40.580
<i>they have caused more than</i>
<i>three million deaths across the world.</i>

44:40.670 --> 44:43.130
<i>And unfortunately,</i>
<i>it's just the beginning.</i>

44:50.050 --> 44:51.260
Fucking faggot!

44:51.460 --> 44:54.040
Poutine's gonna fuck us all!

44:55.960 --> 44:59.210
It's his 26th call! I can't answer him!
What am I gonna say?

44:59.300 --> 45:01.970
We're dead if they don't come back.
I knew it!

45:02.050 --> 45:03.050
SCOTSMAN

45:03.130 --> 45:05.790
They fucked us over!
I knew this was gonna happen!

45:07.010 --> 45:07.930
Motherfucker!

45:09.960 --> 45:13.000
We're not in <i>Scarface?</i>
We're not in <i>Scarface, </i>fuck you!

45:13.170 --> 45:15.080
-Where are those English pricks?
-I'm talking to him now!

45:15.170 --> 45:17.460
-Ask him where he is!
-Hey, they fucked us over!

45:17.550 --> 45:19.760
-Ask him where he is.
-Don't you get it?

45:20.840 --> 45:22.470
Let's go, we're gonna find them.

45:24.840 --> 45:26.590
On my mother's life,
watch what we do to them.

45:26.670 --> 45:27.830
Son of a bitch.

45:27.920 --> 45:30.330
We'll teach them! Motherfuckers, let's go.

45:32.010 --> 45:33.010
Right, well...

45:33.550 --> 45:36.680
-I'll take them both out for you.
-Grab a bulletproof vest!

45:37.630 --> 45:40.420
-No, what, wait--
-There are too many loose ends here.

45:40.630 --> 45:43.380
My friend René lives nearby.
One phone call will sort it out.

45:43.710 --> 45:45.330
Come on, give that to me.

45:45.420 --> 45:47.580
-Let's call your mother.
-No.

45:47.670 --> 45:48.710
-We're calling her.
-No.

45:48.800 --> 45:51.590
Yes, because the shit has hit the fan.

45:51.670 --> 45:53.080
Don't call her, please.

45:53.840 --> 45:54.970
Give this to me.

45:55.800 --> 45:56.640
Let go, please.

45:59.090 --> 46:00.720
-Are you ready or what?
-I'll kill him!

46:00.800 --> 46:02.800
We're gonna get them. Let's go!

46:02.880 --> 46:04.460
You need to stay calm.

46:05.210 --> 46:06.040
There's no smoke.

46:07.550 --> 46:09.140
-The grenades?
-Take 'em.

46:09.210 --> 46:10.500
Get the bags, I'll talk to him.

46:12.090 --> 46:13.800
Strap your balls on, let's go find them.

46:15.420 --> 46:16.830
Are you coming or not?

46:17.420 --> 46:19.540
Fucking pussy!

46:21.170 --> 46:22.000
Motherfucker.

46:23.420 --> 46:26.630
Wallah, they fucked us over!
Like we're shit on their shoe.

46:31.670 --> 46:33.000
Hey, what are you doing?

46:34.760 --> 46:36.970
Move your ass.
We have to find them first.

46:37.050 --> 46:39.510
-Where?
-They took 200 grand in cash.

46:39.590 --> 46:41.640
Where do you think? Let's go.

48:35.550 --> 48:36.390
Oh, fuck!

48:41.800 --> 48:44.010
<i>-Mr. Lhermitte of Mr. Freeze.</i>
-Yes, good evening.

48:44.090 --> 48:46.970
<i>I've not heard from you.</i>
<i>Need I remind you I have other offers?</i>

48:47.050 --> 48:48.590
Listen, Jean-Luc, you're ringing me
in the middle of the night.

48:48.670 --> 48:50.330
<i>-But--</i>
-No, with family.

48:50.420 --> 48:52.830
You're rather aggressive,
so I'll be honest-- take the best offer.

48:55.670 --> 48:58.710
<i>Okay, listen,</i>
<i>I suggest we meet in a few days.</i>

48:58.800 --> 49:01.340
<i>Tell your lawyer to complete</i>
<i>the transaction as soon as possible.</i>

49:01.420 --> 49:03.540
It's them!
Yeah, I'll see you in Paris on Monday.

49:03.630 --> 49:06.250
The money will be there.
Don't worry. Good night, Jean-Luc.

49:06.340 --> 49:07.640
<i>That's what we'll--</i>

49:29.710 --> 49:31.040
I'll flirt with him.

49:31.130 --> 49:33.290
-Once we're out, you mug us, okay?
-No, no.

49:33.880 --> 49:35.130
I'll go talk to him.

50:29.550 --> 50:30.890
What are you talking about?

53:32.260 --> 53:33.140
Go, son of a bitch!

53:36.380 --> 53:37.580
What are you babbling about?

53:54.710 --> 53:55.540
Motherfucker!

53:59.300 --> 54:01.510
Motherfucker! Son of a bitch!

54:01.590 --> 54:03.470
Let me go!

55:05.340 --> 55:07.890
<i>The power is there, somewhere.</i>

55:07.960 --> 55:12.830
<i>A monster, you know.</i>
<i>The Leviathan, as Hobbes wrote.</i>

55:13.460 --> 55:18.040
<i>From time to time, this monster,</i>
<i>comes out of its cave</i>

55:18.130 --> 55:22.960
<i>and demands 10,000 youngsters,</i>
<i>40,000 young girls so it can eat them.</i>

55:23.260 --> 55:25.140
<i>We are powerless against this monster.</i>

55:25.210 --> 55:29.290
<i>We can place paper barricades</i>
<i>around its cave,</i>

55:29.380 --> 55:32.080
<i>limiting the State's prerogatives.</i>

55:32.170 --> 55:34.710
<i>And this can be seen to be amusing.</i>

55:34.800 --> 55:37.470
<i>That's the problem with denunciation.</i>

55:37.550 --> 55:42.260
<i>There is a passage by Plato,</i>
<i>who himself, was very decadent...</i>

55:56.170 --> 55:57.210
Hi, Mom.

56:00.590 --> 56:01.890
Thanks for coming.

56:06.550 --> 56:09.090
I'm sorry about what happened
at the restaurant.

56:09.840 --> 56:13.840
-I had no choice.
-Forget about it. Give Mother a kiss.

56:20.170 --> 56:21.580
Tell me what's wrong.

56:21.670 --> 56:23.580
It's like the Boisniard Hotel
in Courchevel.

56:23.670 --> 56:26.540
There are a couple of guards on patrol,
but nothing heavy.

56:26.630 --> 56:29.040
The safes are probably basic D340s.

56:29.130 --> 56:33.040
No. It's an S2 class.
Lamya sent me a picture.

56:33.670 --> 56:35.290
-Oh, you spoke to her?
-Yeah!

56:36.050 --> 56:39.550
She told me what you've been up to.
And I'm unimpressed.

57:12.340 --> 57:15.760
<i>Some people think that those</i>
<i>in high-powered jobs across the world</i>

57:15.840 --> 57:18.510
<i>are in fact, reptilian aliens.</i>

57:18.590 --> 57:20.890
<i>These beings can take on human form</i>
<i>to rule the world...</i>

57:20.960 --> 57:24.330
Hey. You did good calling your mother.

57:26.800 --> 57:27.640
Okay?

57:39.920 --> 57:44.250
<i>Legend has it that Christian Rosenkreutz</i>
<i>acquired his secret knowledge</i>

57:44.340 --> 57:46.050
<i>from the ancient Egyptians.</i>

57:46.130 --> 57:49.920
<i>A civilization to which a number</i>
<i>of secret sects ascribe their origin.</i>

58:17.340 --> 58:18.430
Stop! No!

58:19.050 --> 58:22.140
Stop! No! Mama!

58:29.630 --> 58:34.880
<i>Political intrigue and coups d'état</i>
<i>are their objectives. In other words...</i>

58:34.960 --> 58:37.000
Can you stop with that?
It's driving me crazy.

58:37.550 --> 58:41.220
Even if it's muddled, it makes sense.

58:41.710 --> 58:44.500
Apple, Microsoft, Nestlé...

58:45.380 --> 58:47.750
Jay-Z and Beyoncé, it's all connected.

58:48.380 --> 58:52.000
Drive! Drive. Drive!

58:58.670 --> 58:59.500
Did you get the money?

59:00.960 --> 59:02.040
What the fuck is this?

59:02.130 --> 59:03.080
-Calm down!
-Why?

59:03.170 --> 59:04.790
There was nothing in the safe.
It was empty.

59:04.880 --> 59:07.880
-Why do this?
-I took her, it's the same thing. Better.

59:07.960 --> 59:11.790
-You can use her to get your money back!
-We have to take her back! Tell her!

59:16.300 --> 59:17.340
What are you saying?

59:19.300 --> 59:22.430
It's her father. Get back at him.
Most of all, be strong.

59:22.510 --> 59:23.970
Understand? Strong.

59:28.670 --> 59:30.920
-Be strong.
-Hello? Hello?

59:31.010 --> 59:33.050
I've got no signal! Fuck! Turn here!

59:33.920 --> 59:35.130
For fuck's sake, stop!

59:53.630 --> 59:55.630
What's he saying? What did he say?

59:58.090 --> 59:59.640
What's he saying?
Do you want me to make her scream?

1:00:07.960 --> 1:00:09.130
Are you crazy? Stop!

1:00:10.050 --> 1:00:14.220
-They have to be scared, okay?
-Do you realize what you're doing?

1:00:14.300 --> 1:00:15.720
-Come here!
-We're in deep shit!

1:00:15.800 --> 1:00:17.340
-Danny, Danny!
-Come here!

1:00:17.420 --> 1:00:19.080
-Danny, it's fine.
-Get over here!

1:00:19.170 --> 1:00:22.630
-I'm here, don't worry.
-Get off me!

1:00:24.510 --> 1:00:26.470
-I'm trying to help.
-Hey, it's true!

1:00:30.420 --> 1:00:35.250
Okay, listen. It's gotten out of hand,
I'm calling René. He's a friend.

1:00:37.380 --> 1:00:41.210
We can't go back to the hotel.
We'll go to his place to think.

1:01:46.880 --> 1:01:48.420
Hey! What's he up to now?

1:01:48.710 --> 1:01:51.420
Where is he? No, he's not here.

1:01:51.800 --> 1:01:55.010
Everything you see here,
tiles from Marrakech.

1:01:55.090 --> 1:01:56.760
Lisbon granite on your left.

1:01:56.840 --> 1:01:58.550
-It's amazing.
-Know what I'm doing now?

1:01:58.630 --> 1:01:59.670
You're gonna say,

1:01:59.760 --> 1:02:02.640
"René hasn't changed.
He's always one step ahead of the rest."

1:02:02.710 --> 1:02:03.750
What is it?

1:02:07.670 --> 1:02:09.540
-Eritreans.
-Blacks?

1:02:09.630 --> 1:02:11.750
Immigrants.
I let them stay here for the traffickers.

1:02:13.880 --> 1:02:14.960
It's a great idea.

1:02:15.050 --> 1:02:17.550
One euro a day. Got to be bloody stupid.

1:02:18.460 --> 1:02:20.630
Once you understand that, boom!
You rise.

1:02:20.710 --> 1:02:21.750
-Oh, yeah.
-And very high.

1:02:21.840 --> 1:02:24.180
-That's amazing!
-Paoudré!

1:02:24.510 --> 1:02:26.180
I've been looking for you everywhere,
what the fuck are you doing?

1:02:26.510 --> 1:02:28.260
Sorry to wake you!

1:02:28.340 --> 1:02:29.550
Let's go!

1:02:29.630 --> 1:02:33.710
This isn't summer camp, you know!
Europe isn't a giant Club Med.

1:02:34.300 --> 1:02:36.090
That's him at top speed.

1:02:37.260 --> 1:02:40.300
Could you bring us some grapes,
and some glasses as well?

1:02:40.840 --> 1:02:42.800
Bring five. Go on!

1:02:44.170 --> 1:02:46.460
Hey! Send the second one!

1:02:46.760 --> 1:02:49.470
It's totally legit.

1:02:49.550 --> 1:02:53.550
Congrats. It's brilliant.
And there's so many of them.

1:02:57.800 --> 1:02:59.430
What? I just said, there's so many.

1:03:01.130 --> 1:03:04.500
And you feel like-- how can I put it?

1:03:04.670 --> 1:03:06.540
-You're being useful.
-Of course.

1:03:06.630 --> 1:03:09.460
And you know, these poor guys,
holding themselves back.

1:03:09.550 --> 1:03:12.430
-It's a hit.
-I'm like a father to them, you know.

1:03:14.050 --> 1:03:17.430
And that's extremely rewarding.
Extremely.

1:03:18.510 --> 1:03:19.640
Know what I'm saying?

1:03:24.960 --> 1:03:27.460
I'm telling you, these idiots
aren't getting one penny from us!

1:03:27.550 --> 1:03:29.510
-What's wrong with you?
-What?

1:03:29.590 --> 1:03:30.840
You hurt her.

1:03:31.130 --> 1:03:34.670
It's fine. She knows it was for fun.
Wasn't it, darling?

1:03:49.050 --> 1:03:50.390
Why are you like that?

1:03:51.050 --> 1:03:55.760
I don't see the connection.
I never judged you, Henri. No!

1:03:57.130 --> 1:03:58.750
So, as I was saying to Henri,

1:03:58.840 --> 1:04:01.180
the problem isn't the kidnapping.

1:04:01.260 --> 1:04:02.090
Course not.

1:04:02.510 --> 1:04:04.720
The problem is getting the dough.

1:04:04.800 --> 1:04:07.140
-Why do you think I stopped in '88?
-Exactly!

1:04:10.300 --> 1:04:11.970
It wasn't profitable. It was over!

1:04:12.050 --> 1:04:15.760
It was out of fashion.
We must reinvent ourselves.

1:04:15.840 --> 1:04:19.470
-I'm gonna ask for 300,000.
-What are we gonna do with 300,000?

1:04:19.550 --> 1:04:20.930
You know how much properties
cost in Saint-Rémy?

1:04:21.010 --> 1:04:24.800
-What about Saint-Rémy?
-You call me into help,

1:04:24.880 --> 1:04:27.000
to do the dirty work to pay
for your little project?

1:04:28.550 --> 1:04:31.300
Don't you think I'm tired of all this,
François?

1:04:32.300 --> 1:04:33.680
You'll leave like your father...

1:04:34.340 --> 1:04:37.180
and let your poor mother die alone?

1:04:37.260 --> 1:04:38.550
Stop, of course not!

1:04:40.460 --> 1:04:44.540
Listen, François. Your mother
has been through a lot, you know.

1:04:44.710 --> 1:04:46.080
-It's true.
-You see...

1:04:46.670 --> 1:04:48.580
-Even he agrees.
-Of course.

1:04:56.010 --> 1:04:59.720
We have to stick together.
Ask for a million.

1:04:59.800 --> 1:05:01.760
One million is ridiculous! Wake up!

1:05:01.840 --> 1:05:04.720
How do you think kidnappers do it?

1:05:04.800 --> 1:05:09.220
Idiot. Are you stupid or what?
A kid is precious!

1:05:09.300 --> 1:05:10.510
It's their whole lives!

1:05:11.630 --> 1:05:14.250
-No, that's it!
-Wake up! Hey!

1:05:14.340 --> 1:05:16.390
In these situations,
it's always the kids who suffer.

1:05:17.710 --> 1:05:20.670
I love kids. They're magical!

1:05:24.710 --> 1:05:26.750
I've suffered, too.
I don't like to talk about it.

1:05:26.840 --> 1:05:28.010
Me too.

1:05:29.550 --> 1:05:30.680
He hung up.

1:05:31.380 --> 1:05:33.750
I told you, it's too much,
we won't get more than 300!

1:05:33.840 --> 1:05:37.300
We'll show him we're not messing around.
We'll cut off her finger.

1:05:39.300 --> 1:05:40.180
Danny!

1:05:44.550 --> 1:05:49.260
Make them respect you.
They must understand.

1:06:07.710 --> 1:06:09.000
Hey, quit it!

1:06:11.590 --> 1:06:14.800
-Yeah, bitch, run! Run!
-Hey look! It's them, I'm sure it's him!

1:06:18.840 --> 1:06:21.890
-You're gonna get it!
-Fuck him up!

1:06:21.960 --> 1:06:25.580
Fuck them up! Fuck him up!

1:06:27.380 --> 1:06:29.000
Don't move! Don't move!

1:06:29.090 --> 1:06:30.890
Don't move! Get him!

1:06:31.510 --> 1:06:32.550
Fuck him up!

1:06:32.960 --> 1:06:35.540
You're English? Well, I'm not!
Son of a bitch. Get back in the car!

1:06:37.300 --> 1:06:39.800
What's your problem?
Fucking cocksuckers!

1:06:40.420 --> 1:06:43.920
<i>Hijo de puta! </i>You got fucked up
real good, motherfuckers!

1:06:44.010 --> 1:06:46.470
Huh? That's France, bitches!

1:06:49.710 --> 1:06:51.710
<i>That's what happens to the English!</i>

1:06:51.800 --> 1:06:54.640
-What are you doing?
-We're live on Periscope, bro!

1:06:54.710 --> 1:06:56.540
Stop! The cops will see!

1:06:56.630 --> 1:06:59.580
I'll fuck up every Brit bitch I see!

1:09:32.590 --> 1:09:36.840
Those blue eyes are so beautiful,
like the Pacific Ocean.

1:09:37.550 --> 1:09:43.970
A mermaid, the Caribbean, Polynesia,
my aphrodisiac canary.

1:09:44.050 --> 1:09:46.720
Think about it-- you and me,
with my emerald-green eyes.

1:09:46.800 --> 1:09:48.510
Our babies would be so cute.

1:09:50.590 --> 1:09:52.510
Okay. You both take the boat with Henri.

1:09:52.590 --> 1:09:55.220
-I'll take the daughter back.
-How did you even find us?

1:09:55.300 --> 1:09:58.470
-Why'd you kidnap the girl?
-You working for the police?

1:09:58.550 --> 1:10:01.220
What do you mean?
You're on Periscope 24/7, idiot!

1:10:01.300 --> 1:10:03.300
-I told you about Periscope!
-Motherfucker!

1:10:03.380 --> 1:10:05.380
Calm down.

1:10:05.460 --> 1:10:07.500
-Fucking faggot!
-You're screwed, motherfucker.

1:10:07.590 --> 1:10:10.470
So... there are several tons on the boat.

1:10:11.050 --> 1:10:13.390
We'll give Poutine what he expects
and split the rest.

1:10:14.710 --> 1:10:16.040
You'll be loaded.

1:10:17.920 --> 1:10:18.750
So?

1:10:30.840 --> 1:10:32.090
Hey, are you listening?

1:10:50.170 --> 1:10:51.670
If he's in, I'm in.

1:10:52.880 --> 1:10:54.210
Henri will call you.

1:10:55.550 --> 1:10:57.260
Meanwhile, keep the girl
in the locker room.

1:10:57.340 --> 1:10:59.300
Once we've made the exchange,
I'll pick you up.

1:10:59.380 --> 1:11:01.920
We'll split the money
and head straight to the airport.

1:11:02.260 --> 1:11:03.220
What do you think?

1:11:09.630 --> 1:11:11.790
Hold on, everyone's just playing you.

1:11:11.880 --> 1:11:14.170
Your mom fucked everything up.
I don't trust her.

1:11:20.760 --> 1:11:22.300
How are you?

1:11:22.420 --> 1:11:24.380
Everything's just great.

1:11:32.090 --> 1:11:33.890
I know I fucked up, I'm sorry.

1:11:37.340 --> 1:11:40.090
<i>I'm a loser, but...</i>
<i>I don't want to lose you.</i>

1:11:42.460 --> 1:11:44.040
<i>I think I'm falling for you.</i>

1:11:46.170 --> 1:11:49.670
<i>But if you don't wanna be with me,</i>
<i>then stay where you are.</i>

1:11:50.710 --> 1:11:51.960
Is it tomorrow?

1:11:54.960 --> 1:11:55.830
Yeah.

1:12:05.960 --> 1:12:07.540
You'll meet with the Scotsman.

1:12:07.800 --> 1:12:10.550
You get the 300,000. I'll make the call.

1:12:10.630 --> 1:12:12.330
I'll pick you both up,
we'll go to the airport,

1:12:12.420 --> 1:12:15.460
-and be in Frankfurt three hours later.
-Why Frankfurt?

1:12:15.960 --> 1:12:17.830
Because nobody'll come
looking for us there.

1:12:18.050 --> 1:12:20.840
-The money split, when's that happening?
-In the car.

1:12:20.920 --> 1:12:24.790
Okay, that's a good idea.
But forget your slut of a girlfriend.

1:12:27.170 --> 1:12:30.540
You know you can't trust her.
She'll just use you.

1:12:30.800 --> 1:12:32.930
That kind of girl
isn't looking for a nice guy.

1:12:38.420 --> 1:12:40.460
Okay. I'll explain everything
to Henri and René.

1:12:41.960 --> 1:12:42.790
What?

1:12:50.380 --> 1:12:52.380
I know it hasn't been easy for you.

1:13:02.880 --> 1:13:04.250
For me either, you know.

1:13:11.050 --> 1:13:14.970
I'm proud of you.
You've become a handsome young man.

1:13:37.920 --> 1:13:39.210
I'm gonna go see them.

1:14:00.550 --> 1:14:02.760
I shouldn't say this
and I've had a bit to drink.

1:14:02.840 --> 1:14:05.640
But-- what is it?

1:14:24.210 --> 1:14:25.040
<i>Hello?</i>

1:14:25.130 --> 1:14:27.460
-Yeah. Hey, do you speak Spanish?
<i>-Of course.</i>

1:14:27.550 --> 1:14:33.010
I am a student in Miss Martinez's
Spanish class.

1:14:33.090 --> 1:14:36.550
<i>-Here's what you need to say.</i>
-Okay.

1:14:39.550 --> 1:14:40.680
Very well.

1:15:55.260 --> 1:15:56.430
Put the weight up front!

1:15:58.260 --> 1:16:01.090
Don't put all of them on the same side!
Balance.

1:16:01.300 --> 1:16:04.840
Keep stability in mind.
No. No, no! Hey! Paoudré!

1:16:04.920 --> 1:16:07.540
If you put it all in back,
the car will never move.

1:16:07.630 --> 1:16:10.290
Didn't you learn that in school?
It's basic math.

1:16:13.300 --> 1:16:14.800
Salt water eats everything.

1:16:14.880 --> 1:16:17.710
Mohamed, think!

1:17:18.090 --> 1:17:20.840
-Hello?
-<i>Yeah, we'll be there in a few minutes.</i>

1:17:23.090 --> 1:17:25.800
-Everything okay?
<i>-Fine. Why wouldn't it be?</i>

1:17:25.880 --> 1:17:27.210
<i>I've got a good feeling, don't worry.</i>

1:17:59.630 --> 1:18:04.290
Abdel! Abdel!
There are people coming.

1:18:08.260 --> 1:18:10.010
Just some immigrants.
Nothing to worry about.

1:18:10.340 --> 1:18:11.590
Coming from Spain?

1:18:17.130 --> 1:18:18.790
Should we tell the boss?

1:18:18.880 --> 1:18:20.790
There's nothing for you here!
Change course!

1:18:20.880 --> 1:18:24.460
-Change course!
-Spain's the other way!

1:18:31.800 --> 1:18:34.050
-Lower your weapon!
-Come on!

1:18:34.550 --> 1:18:37.260
On your feet!
Hands in the air! Come on!

1:18:38.420 --> 1:18:39.630
That's the way to do it!

1:18:39.710 --> 1:18:43.290
Hands up! Hands up!

1:18:43.380 --> 1:18:44.420
Do as he says!

1:19:04.760 --> 1:19:07.390
-Hello? Everything all right?
<i>-Fantastic!</i>

1:19:07.460 --> 1:19:09.250
<i>-We're boarding the boat.</i>
-Okay.

1:20:12.300 --> 1:20:14.510
My mother's fucked it up.
Bring out the girl.

1:20:14.590 --> 1:20:16.260
<i>I knew it. It's over. She stays with me.</i>

1:20:24.170 --> 1:20:26.000
Come here, motherfucker!

1:20:26.090 --> 1:20:27.680
I asked you, where are the drugs?

1:20:27.760 --> 1:20:29.760
Speak French! Fucking Brits!

1:20:30.050 --> 1:20:31.430
Keep an eye on these pricks.

1:20:31.510 --> 1:20:33.930
I hate the English.
I hate England. Fucking Brit!

1:20:35.260 --> 1:20:37.140
Trying to be smart, Brit, huh?

1:20:42.170 --> 1:20:44.880
-Henri!
-Winner, loser.

1:20:58.920 --> 1:21:00.500
Come on! Let's go! <i>Vamos!</i>

1:21:00.590 --> 1:21:03.970
Come on, faster, faster, faster!

1:21:04.170 --> 1:21:06.330
Go, go, go!

1:21:06.960 --> 1:21:08.210
Go, go, go!

1:21:20.920 --> 1:21:21.920
Come on, faster!

1:21:24.340 --> 1:21:26.590
<i>Vamos, vamos! Vamos!</i>

1:21:26.670 --> 1:21:29.290
Check it all out!
We're gonna be rollin' in it, man!

1:21:29.380 --> 1:21:31.670
-It's them.
-Who's them?

1:21:32.630 --> 1:21:33.460
Come on!

1:21:33.880 --> 1:21:34.790
The logos?

1:21:34.880 --> 1:21:36.710
You're being ridiculous.
They're dealers' marks, bro!

1:21:36.800 --> 1:21:38.390
-No, it's them...
-To tell who owns what.

1:21:38.460 --> 1:21:41.380
That's for Stains.
That triangle's for the guy in Grigny

1:21:41.460 --> 1:21:44.380
Man, forget all that bullshit!

1:21:44.460 --> 1:21:46.380
We're the Illuminati now!

1:21:58.920 --> 1:22:02.580
Momo! We're gonna be so rich!

1:22:15.670 --> 1:22:17.670
It's the ladies' locker. Get out!

1:22:19.630 --> 1:22:21.420
Hello? What the fuck are you doing?

1:22:21.510 --> 1:22:22.890
<i>-We took back control.</i>
-What?

1:22:22.960 --> 1:22:25.790
-Help!
<i>-We've taken back control.</i>

1:22:26.590 --> 1:22:27.430
Come here!

1:22:28.550 --> 1:22:31.550
Open up! Open the door, for fuck's sake!

1:22:32.420 --> 1:22:33.710
What are you doing?

1:22:33.800 --> 1:22:35.510
You and your mother
trying to screw me?

1:22:35.920 --> 1:22:36.920
What's going on?

1:22:37.010 --> 1:22:38.590
She's not going till I get my cut!

1:22:38.670 --> 1:22:41.000
-This wasn't the plan!
-I don't care. She's not going!

1:22:41.300 --> 1:22:42.760
-Hey, trust me.
-You lied to me!

1:22:42.840 --> 1:22:45.390
-Calm down.
-You'll dump me, too.

1:22:45.460 --> 1:22:47.710
Calm down. I need you. Hey!

1:22:47.800 --> 1:22:50.340
-You'll leave me!
-No.

1:22:53.210 --> 1:22:54.330
I need you.

1:22:59.510 --> 1:23:00.510
Trust me.

1:23:05.710 --> 1:23:07.460
I'll see you at the meeting place.

1:23:13.260 --> 1:23:17.180
Mo, there's smoke
coming from up there!

1:23:25.170 --> 1:23:26.920
We've taken back control.

1:23:32.670 --> 1:23:34.750
What's going on?
Have you lost your mind?

1:23:34.920 --> 1:23:37.420
We've got enough, let's get out of here.

1:23:42.960 --> 1:23:44.750
<i>-¿Que tal, amigos?</i>
-Go on, make the call.

1:23:44.840 --> 1:23:45.800
<i>Muy bien.</i>

1:23:50.590 --> 1:23:53.390
<i>Yes, Inspector Xavi.</i>
<i>We're at Aquasplash. I'm listening.</i>

1:23:53.460 --> 1:23:56.130
-The bomb is in the little girl's bag.
<i>-Little girl?</i>

1:23:56.210 --> 1:23:58.710
-In her bag!
<i>-Which girl? Which girl?</i>

1:23:58.800 --> 1:24:01.340
Terrorist! Allah Akbar!

1:25:04.260 --> 1:25:05.840
Let's go! Let's go!

1:25:22.760 --> 1:25:24.470
EMPLOYEES ONLY

1:25:37.960 --> 1:25:41.790
Can you open the gate?
It's locked. Are you listening?

1:25:42.340 --> 1:25:44.340
The gate is locked. Farès!

1:25:46.050 --> 1:25:48.890
What are you doing? What are you doing?

1:25:52.920 --> 1:25:57.380
What are you--? Farès! Farès!

1:26:41.840 --> 1:26:44.840
THE QURAN

1:26:59.170 --> 1:27:02.000
-Yeah?
<i>-Tried to fuck me over, son of a bitch?</i>

1:27:02.090 --> 1:27:05.090
I fucked you, you fat fuck!
Listen real good.

1:27:05.170 --> 1:27:06.670
Thanks for all the hash, motherfucker!

1:27:06.760 --> 1:27:09.340
-You've been fucked, cocksucker!
-Motherfucker!

1:27:09.420 --> 1:27:10.880
Thanks for the all the weed, bitch!

1:27:10.960 --> 1:27:13.210
<i>Wanted to play the game?</i>
<i>What do you think of that!</i>

1:27:13.300 --> 1:27:14.470
<i>You like that?</i>

1:27:14.550 --> 1:27:16.590
Do you feel it? Son of a bitch!

1:27:16.670 --> 1:27:18.290
What's going on? Hey!

1:27:18.380 --> 1:27:21.290
Move faster or I'll shoot
and be called racist.

1:27:21.380 --> 1:27:23.290
Paoudré, faster, asshole!

1:27:23.380 --> 1:27:25.630
Let's go! <i>Vamos a la playa.</i>
I'll buy you some sandals.

1:27:25.710 --> 1:27:27.750
-Little shits!
-<i>Si, si!</i>

1:27:44.170 --> 1:27:46.670
<i>-Yes?</i>
-It's all good, they're on their way.

1:27:46.760 --> 1:27:47.840
<i>Very well.</i>

1:29:02.760 --> 1:29:05.090
-Hello? It's done.
-Come on.

1:29:05.170 --> 1:29:06.750
<i>Give him the bag. Go ahead.</i>

1:29:20.210 --> 1:29:25.170
<i>Dearest friend, Mr. Dembélé thanks you</i>
<i>for the information provided.</i>

1:29:25.260 --> 1:29:30.550
<i>And thanks to him, you are the license</i>
<i>holder to Mr. Freeze in North Africa!</i>

1:29:30.630 --> 1:29:35.750
<i>Mazel Tov, Mr. CEO! Mazel Tov!</i>

1:31:30.800 --> 1:31:33.720
No, no, no. I don't want to hear it!

1:31:33.800 --> 1:31:35.720
I don't trust you, so listen to me.

1:31:35.800 --> 1:31:37.430
You told me one thing.
Now, it's different,

1:31:37.510 --> 1:31:38.840
tomorrow, it'll be different again.

1:31:38.920 --> 1:31:41.170
I'm done. The price is the price,
it doesn't change. Hey!

1:31:44.420 --> 1:31:45.920
Do you take me for an idiot?

1:31:46.010 --> 1:31:49.590
If you don't pay me within
seven days, it won't just be a supplier.

1:31:50.550 --> 1:31:52.180
Yes, that's a threat!

1:31:53.880 --> 1:31:55.460
Let me explain!

1:31:55.550 --> 1:31:59.590
Hey, hey! If you block the merchandise,
I swear to you, I'll rip you apart!

1:32:00.840 --> 1:32:03.180
Yes, I can do what I like.

1:33:15.090 --> 1:33:20.430
For Mehdi.
