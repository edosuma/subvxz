00:11.839 --> 00:13.480
[tense music playing]

00:22.800 --> 00:24.039
Turn the engine off.

00:27.839 --> 00:29.839
[Nicolae] Dear comrades and friends.

00:30.559 --> 00:34.960
I have summoned you here
to bring to your attention

00:34.960 --> 00:38.759
a matter that is
of the utmost importance.

00:40.159 --> 00:42.280
A matter that worries me.

00:43.280 --> 00:45.960
<i>And if it is serious enough
to worry me,</i>

00:46.679 --> 00:49.719
<i>then it most certainly
should worry you too.</i>

00:50.560 --> 00:53.359
We are besieged
by smugglers and offenders

00:53.359 --> 00:58.479
trying to corrupt our nation
that we worked so hard to protect.

00:58.479 --> 01:04.599
Many comrades here
are faithful and devoted...

01:06.519 --> 01:09.120
and committed to the Party's ideals.

01:10.280 --> 01:14.920
At the same time,
there are some of those among us...

01:16.120 --> 01:19.079
who choose to betray
this country's interests.

01:19.079 --> 01:23.640
<i>Those who attempt to infiltrate
the structures of the Party</i>

01:23.640 --> 01:26.719
and the country's institutions
for foreign agencies.

01:26.719 --> 01:30.000
I promise you this
right here, right now.

01:30.000 --> 01:35.439
<i>We will severely and harshly punish
those who choose to betray the Party,</i>

01:35.439 --> 01:38.920
as well as our great nation!

01:40.519 --> 01:41.959
[crowd applauding]

02:13.520 --> 02:15.280
I'll catch up with you soon.

02:15.280 --> 02:16.680
[ominous music playing]

02:23.080 --> 02:24.319
We have a problem.

02:33.479 --> 02:35.960
<i>[Ioan] A truck was found
at the border earlier</i>

02:35.960 --> 02:38.120
filled with illegal goods.

02:38.120 --> 02:40.280
Traveling under diplomatic seal.

02:41.039 --> 02:46.199
The driver's name is Lari Bogdan,
said he worked for the DIE.

02:48.759 --> 02:53.360
And why would a DIE agent be involved
in smuggling goods into Romania?

02:57.680 --> 02:59.919
That's exactly
the question we're asking.

02:59.919 --> 03:03.400
That is, myself
and the Central Committee.

03:05.199 --> 03:06.879
I don't know any Lari Bogdan.

03:08.400 --> 03:10.560
But I'm sure
you'll find out if he's lying.

03:11.879 --> 03:16.000
Well, he is dead now,
so I guess we'll never know for sure.

03:17.879 --> 03:19.479
Hung himself in his cell.

03:20.719 --> 03:23.360
- He had issues, apparently.
- [chuckles]

03:24.240 --> 03:28.520
Comrade Godeanu, I'm assuming
you're aware that the Party

03:28.520 --> 03:30.879
is taking this very seriously.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.400
I would expect
nothing less from them.

03:34.400 --> 03:39.800
Good. So then you're willing
to cooperate with us, completely.

03:41.319 --> 03:42.560
Absolutely.

03:44.080 --> 03:45.599
[theme music playing]

05:15.600 --> 05:17.600
[car horns honking in distance]

05:39.800 --> 05:41.800
You don't seem so happy
to have me here.

05:45.040 --> 05:48.079
You weren't too happy to see me
at the U.S. embassy either.

05:59.399 --> 06:00.759
I was just surprised.

06:03.319 --> 06:04.800
Yeah, so was I.

06:08.240 --> 06:09.839
What were you up to?

06:36.519 --> 06:37.759
You kept it.

06:39.759 --> 06:41.360
I don't throw away gifts.

06:44.399 --> 06:45.800
You should be careful.

06:48.040 --> 06:49.480
People will think it's real.

06:50.079 --> 06:51.560
You might get yourself shot.

06:55.480 --> 06:57.160
You don't need to worry about me.

06:58.720 --> 06:59.959
Not now.

07:03.399 --> 07:04.720
Ooh.

07:05.720 --> 07:09.879
Fancy. Who's this one for? Your wife?

07:11.079 --> 07:12.319
Your girlfriend?

07:21.959 --> 07:23.199
It's for my daughter.

07:27.279 --> 07:29.959
What are you,
the best daddy in the world?

07:35.920 --> 07:37.160
I wish I was.

07:43.519 --> 07:45.319
You know, all these years, and...

07:46.720 --> 07:49.000
I was thinking
you didn't remember any of it.

07:54.000 --> 07:57.519
I'm guessing you didn't just
come to see me for old times' sake.

08:00.720 --> 08:02.680
So, what does the Stasi want?

08:05.079 --> 08:07.240
Just another name on that damn list.

08:08.920 --> 08:10.439
What are you offering?

08:11.120 --> 08:13.399
I heard Shakarov was in town.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.800
Something big must be going down.

08:17.680 --> 08:20.600
Last time he was here,
the airport attack happened.

08:23.160 --> 08:24.639
[phone ringing]

08:30.920 --> 08:32.200
<i>- [Frank] Scott.
- [sighs]</i>

08:33.159 --> 08:36.120
You didn't happen to think
I'd be asleep, did you?

08:36.120 --> 08:39.399
<i>You're awake. Look,
I can't wait on this indefinitely.</i>

08:39.399 --> 08:43.279
<i>- I need a Plan B.
- Plan B? Like Angola?</i>

08:43.279 --> 08:46.039
Come on. That was then,
and I've taken enough stick for it.

08:46.759 --> 08:48.000
This is different.

08:49.279 --> 08:52.039
For Christ's sake,
I'm meeting him now. What do I say?

08:52.039 --> 08:55.159
I can't believe
you jumped the gun, again.

08:55.159 --> 08:58.440
Scott, he's a big fish
and the sharks will be circling.

08:58.440 --> 09:00.600
We need to move on this now.
Help me out here.

09:00.600 --> 09:01.919
[chattering]

09:06.799 --> 09:08.360
Good morning, Comrade Godeanu.

09:10.000 --> 09:14.240
Good morning. I'm Carmen Popescu,
director at the Ministry of Interior.

09:15.639 --> 09:18.639
It is a pleasure
to meet you, finally.

09:19.399 --> 09:20.639
You as well.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.679
You know, I had actually tried
to reach you in Bucharest,

09:23.679 --> 09:27.399
however, you left earlier
than planned, I guess?

09:28.440 --> 09:30.639
I've been assigned
to help you in the negotiations.

09:30.639 --> 09:32.399
Yesterday, how was it?

09:33.320 --> 09:36.559
Well, the Germans added
some new names to the list.

09:36.559 --> 09:38.519
We're going to need time
to review it.

09:39.679 --> 09:41.080
Okay, but Sorin told me

09:41.080 --> 09:43.639
they already offered us
three million Deutsche Mark,

09:43.639 --> 09:45.759
which to me is a great deal.

09:47.240 --> 09:50.720
We should just take it
and head home, in my opinion.

09:50.720 --> 09:52.759
I think it's best not to rush it.

09:53.519 --> 09:56.480
Comrade Ceaușescu
expects much more from us.

10:00.639 --> 10:02.759
I need to pick up a gift
for my daughter.

10:03.519 --> 10:05.960
Drop me off here.
I'll meet you at the Ministry.

10:05.960 --> 10:08.759
Oh, we'll just wait for you.
It won't take long, right?

10:10.440 --> 10:11.679
Of course not.

10:14.960 --> 10:17.720
The shop is on the corner.
You can pull over here.

11:14.360 --> 11:16.639
I think I'll go buy something
for myself too.

11:31.799 --> 11:33.279
- Hello.
- [woman] Hello.

11:33.279 --> 11:35.879
- Can I ask you something?
- Yes, of course.

11:36.679 --> 11:38.320
I'm looking for my colleague.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.720
Is there another way out of here?

11:45.399 --> 11:47.360
[woman] No, miss.
Only the front door.

11:50.519 --> 11:52.600
[Carmen] So where did
my colleague go?

11:52.600 --> 11:54.559
[woman] I'm not following, sorry.

11:55.960 --> 11:57.799
[Carmen]
There was a man that just came in.

11:57.799 --> 12:00.200
Tall, dark hair.
You can't have missed him.

12:02.399 --> 12:03.639
Oh, there you are.

12:05.159 --> 12:06.679
Thought you disappeared.

12:06.679 --> 12:08.960
[Victor] I was just
trying on a shirt.

12:09.759 --> 12:11.000
[Carmen] Hmm.

12:13.960 --> 12:15.480
Well, we're running late.

12:17.720 --> 12:19.759
I'll just get this scarf
for my daughter,

12:19.759 --> 12:21.080
if that's okay with you.

12:25.519 --> 12:28.159
- What was that?
- We're having maintenance work done.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.440
Comrade?

13:13.879 --> 13:15.120
Right.

13:17.720 --> 13:19.320
[pensive music playing]

13:59.600 --> 14:02.320
Lari Bogdan hanged himself
in his cell.

14:02.320 --> 14:04.360
I bet Godeanu had a hand in it.

14:06.240 --> 14:09.200
[Mircea] If he went that far,
he must be running scared.

14:10.480 --> 14:11.720
As he should be.

14:15.240 --> 14:18.559
If you do what I tell you, we can
take that bastard down within days.

14:19.519 --> 14:21.960
I got the photo,
but that is not enough.

14:21.960 --> 14:24.600
[Ioan] Why? It's exactly
what we were waiting for.

14:24.600 --> 14:27.720
- Don't you wonder when?
- I need to time it right.

14:27.720 --> 14:29.679
Make sure I hold all the cards.

14:29.679 --> 14:33.759
Especially since I don't have the
best relationship with the president.

14:34.559 --> 14:37.679
He will warm up to you
when we find the warehouse.

14:49.679 --> 14:52.440
[Nicolae] Victor, did you know
the term "checkmate"

14:52.440 --> 14:55.279
comes from Persian,
and it means "the king is dead"?

14:56.360 --> 14:57.759
[Victor] More or less.

14:57.759 --> 15:01.200
The phrase "checkmate"
in Farsi actually means,

15:01.200 --> 15:03.000
"the king is helpless."

15:04.639 --> 15:05.879
Farsi?

15:07.200 --> 15:08.440
I was thinking.

15:09.200 --> 15:13.200
What if that smuggler
was working with someone in the DIE?

15:13.960 --> 15:15.200
Impossible.

15:16.200 --> 15:18.039
We're watching all of my people.

15:19.279 --> 15:20.519
I know.

15:22.000 --> 15:25.120
But sometimes we forget
to look in our own back yard.

15:26.759 --> 15:29.360
I think I should talk
to counterintelligence.

15:29.919 --> 15:32.000
I'll tell Mircea to look into it.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.440
There's no need to make waves.

15:36.240 --> 15:39.879
I can take a closer look at
my agents' moves over the past year.

15:46.960 --> 15:48.200
Hmm? [chuckles]

15:51.720 --> 15:52.960
Victor!

15:55.000 --> 15:56.519
Checkmate!

15:56.519 --> 15:57.879
[Nicolae laughing]

16:00.360 --> 16:01.600
[Victor] Elena.

16:02.240 --> 16:03.480
What is it?

16:04.639 --> 16:08.639
I haven't told Nicolae this yet,
he has enough on his mind right now,

16:08.639 --> 16:10.759
but I feel you should know.

16:10.759 --> 16:16.440
It appears that Comrade Mircea Voinea
has a fondness for redheads.

16:16.440 --> 16:20.919
Redheads are dangerous by default.
So is he fucking one?

16:20.919 --> 16:22.639
It's very possible.

16:24.320 --> 16:28.720
I thought you'd want to know she's
of Russian origin, it would seem.

16:29.919 --> 16:33.159
She's Russian? Is this true?

16:33.159 --> 16:36.480
- It is.
- Mircea is dating a KGB agent?

16:36.480 --> 16:38.279
Hard to tell for sure yet.

16:38.279 --> 16:41.919
All I can say is
she's very beautiful.

16:45.120 --> 16:46.639
Mircea is not the sharpest,

16:46.639 --> 16:49.320
but he's also not stupid enough
to fuck a Russian.

16:51.080 --> 16:52.440
Or maybe he is.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.240
Keep an eye on them.

17:03.840 --> 17:08.000
[Victor] Sew this inside the lining
and have someone give it to his wife.

17:09.759 --> 17:11.359
- Here's the dress.
- Oh, it's lovely.

17:11.359 --> 17:13.359
And before I forget,
this is for you. A present.

17:13.359 --> 17:15.640
A present? For me? How sweet.

17:16.359 --> 17:19.480
Albescu managed to get his hands
on Godeanu's records.

17:20.559 --> 17:22.599
From what I understand,

17:22.599 --> 17:25.440
<i>he got it from the head
of Foreign Intelligence.</i>

17:26.400 --> 17:30.480
<i>It's only a matter of time
before he finds that warehouse.</i>

17:35.920 --> 17:38.799
We need to get these
to every Party member on this list.

17:46.880 --> 17:49.799
I want you to take this
to Comrade Gheață's wife, okay?

17:50.880 --> 17:53.720
- Should we empty the warehouse?
- No. Not yet.

17:56.680 --> 17:59.079
This one goes directly to the palace.

18:03.799 --> 18:05.519
We are fine with the final list.

18:07.480 --> 18:10.359
Pleased to hear that.
And now for the financial--

18:10.359 --> 18:13.960
Before we start talking money,
can I have a word with you?

18:13.960 --> 18:15.279
Of course.

18:19.480 --> 18:22.440
I actually need
to make a call to a German clinic.

18:22.440 --> 18:25.759
- It's an urgent family matter.
- Oh, nothing too serious I hope.

18:27.039 --> 18:30.319
Miss Weizendorff, can you please
show Mr. Godeanu to a phone?

18:30.920 --> 18:32.160
Yes, of course.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.240
It's over there.

18:53.160 --> 18:54.400
[phone rings]

18:55.640 --> 18:57.079
Frank Jackson speaking.

18:57.079 --> 18:59.839
<i>[Victor] This is Victor Godeanu.
Is this Dr. Muller?</i>

19:01.039 --> 19:04.599
- Yes.
- My wife came to see you recently

19:04.599 --> 19:06.079
about a health issue.

19:06.079 --> 19:09.680
Unfortunately,
her situation is getting worse

19:09.680 --> 19:13.359
and I really need
to make an urgent appointment.

19:13.359 --> 19:15.880
Absolutely.
I'm sorry it didn't work out before.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.839
We'll contact you soon
with a date and time.

19:19.480 --> 19:22.160
<i>You don't have a slot
for an operation, do you?</i>

19:23.279 --> 19:24.640
Please be patient.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.759
Everything will be okay.

19:28.759 --> 19:32.079
I appreciate it. Thank you.

19:41.079 --> 19:42.480
Just got a message from Godeanu.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.880
He's in danger. I need you
to sign a temporary refuge.

19:44.880 --> 19:48.000
I'm not signing anything
until I hear from Langley.

19:49.079 --> 19:52.680
'Cause if this goes wrong,
I go down, not you.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.519
This defection
is as big as the White House.

19:55.519 --> 19:59.000
And all we're doing is debating
while this guy's life is at risk.

19:59.000 --> 20:03.440
Some of us assess risk,
instead of going off half-cocked.

20:04.920 --> 20:07.200
Now, if you have a problem with that,

20:07.200 --> 20:09.519
you could call your friend
Scott Dunlop.

20:14.640 --> 20:16.640
I know a good doctor if you need one.

20:17.440 --> 20:19.599
My wife already has a good doctor.

20:21.079 --> 20:22.839
You've gotten good at stealing.

20:24.039 --> 20:25.359
I've had good teachers.

20:26.519 --> 20:30.359
Three thousand Deutsche Marks
for each factory worker.

20:31.000 --> 20:33.640
Nine thousand for each professor.

20:33.640 --> 20:36.880
Twelve thousand Deutsche Marks
for each doctor--

20:36.880 --> 20:38.200
Mr. Godeanu.

20:39.039 --> 20:42.960
We think our offer
of three million Deutsche Mark

20:42.960 --> 20:45.720
is a fair compensation
for the resettling of the Germans.

20:48.079 --> 20:50.119
Germans of Romanian descent.

20:51.000 --> 20:55.039
We have invested money in
the education of these individuals.

20:55.039 --> 20:59.000
It is only reasonable
to recuperate the money we spent.

21:00.759 --> 21:02.319
Um, excuse me for a minute.

21:03.839 --> 21:09.559
Teachers, 7000 Deutsche Mark.
Nurses, 6000--

21:09.559 --> 21:11.160
Mr. Godeanu, I...

21:12.200 --> 21:14.279
I find it-- How should I say this?

21:15.440 --> 21:18.279
I find it difficult
to put a price on a human life.

21:18.920 --> 21:21.359
We're not going to treat this
as if we're trading cattle.

21:22.519 --> 21:25.720
Of course not. We're trading people.

21:29.160 --> 21:30.519
I'm sorry, Mr. Godeanu.

21:31.960 --> 21:33.200
What is your proposal?

21:36.519 --> 21:38.000
Three million is not enough.

21:40.119 --> 21:41.440
[tense music playing]

21:51.279 --> 21:53.200
Hello, Peter. How are you?

21:54.400 --> 21:56.680
Glad to hear it.
I'm in a bit of a rush.

21:56.680 --> 21:58.519
Can you trace a number for me?

21:58.519 --> 22:02.319
It's the last call that was made from
the cloakroom on the second floor.

22:09.359 --> 22:13.519
Eight and three.
That's perfect. Thank you. Bye.

22:26.039 --> 22:27.880
[over phone] Frank Jackson speaking.

22:35.039 --> 22:36.599
We should have signed that deal.

22:36.599 --> 22:39.920
I mean, three million
is more than appropriate.

22:39.920 --> 22:42.559
I'm sure they will contact us
with a better offer.

22:42.559 --> 22:46.240
It's obvious they want those Germans
a lot more than we need the money.

22:46.240 --> 22:48.640
Yeah. Well,
it feels like we're stalling.

22:48.640 --> 22:52.000
Our job here is to get
the best possible offer we can,

22:52.000 --> 22:53.480
not to be fast.

22:53.480 --> 22:54.960
Comrade, you got a message.

23:06.039 --> 23:07.279
Everything all right?

23:08.880 --> 23:12.880
Comrade Ceaușescu wants us
to return to Bucharest. Tomorrow.

23:25.240 --> 23:26.480
Ileana?

23:28.240 --> 23:29.480
Do you want a drink?

23:32.279 --> 23:33.680
[Victor] Is there any left?

23:42.680 --> 23:44.119
Do you know why I drink?

23:47.119 --> 23:51.759
Um, because you can?
Because you're always bored?

23:51.759 --> 23:53.079
Ah. Because I'm bored?

23:54.640 --> 23:56.640
So whose fault is it that I'm bored?

23:58.119 --> 23:59.839
Look, I'm not in the mood.

23:59.839 --> 24:01.839
Yeah, I get it.
You aren't, ever, huh?

24:03.680 --> 24:06.279
- I've tried everything.
- You haven't tried once.

24:07.720 --> 24:09.960
You didn't try
standing up for me once.

24:09.960 --> 24:12.119
You have never
taken my side over hers.

24:14.200 --> 24:17.920
- Hers? Elena Ceaușescu?
- Yeah.

24:23.079 --> 24:24.599
Your wife is right here.

24:26.839 --> 24:28.200
Don't forget that.

24:44.359 --> 24:45.960
She's not coming?

24:45.960 --> 24:48.519
Um... No.

24:50.640 --> 24:51.920
I love you, Dad.

24:59.200 --> 25:00.759
[chattering]

25:04.319 --> 25:05.839
- Good to see you.
- You as well.

25:07.759 --> 25:09.079
I took care of everything.

25:09.880 --> 25:11.119
Good evening.

25:13.440 --> 25:14.720
[Mircea] Comrade Godeanu.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.960
I have to say I never pegged you
for a fan of the piano.

25:20.720 --> 25:23.440
I thought your wife was the one
with the artistic sensibilities.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.480
And I have to say I'm sad to hear

25:25.480 --> 25:27.960
that you don't know
everything about me.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.720
Comrade Voinea.
Looking lovely, as always.

25:30.720 --> 25:33.839
Thank you, Comrade Godeanu.
Is Adela not joining us?

25:33.839 --> 25:36.960
Unfortunately, no.
It's just me and my daughter tonight.

25:36.960 --> 25:40.400
- She's also an artist.
- So nice to finally meet you, Ileana.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.680
You're so beautiful,
just like your mother.

25:42.680 --> 25:46.079
Yes, and just like you, she's always
carried herself with such grace.

25:46.079 --> 25:48.039
We miss seeing her up on stage.

25:49.119 --> 25:51.240
[man] Could you get
a bit closer together?

25:52.880 --> 25:54.799
Don't be shy now, Comrade Godeanu.

25:54.799 --> 25:58.319
You are very photogenic.
You should smile.

25:58.880 --> 26:00.559
- [camera clicks]
- [man] Thank you.

26:02.319 --> 26:04.960
It must feel pretty good,
thinking you are on top.

26:05.920 --> 26:07.759
What are you trying to say,
Comrade Voinea?

26:07.759 --> 26:09.079
Oh, nothing.

26:10.880 --> 26:13.519
I happen to know
one of your former friends.

26:13.519 --> 26:16.880
They were a classmate
of yours from college.

26:17.920 --> 26:19.640
Tells me you were top of your class

26:19.640 --> 26:23.960
and how you once got
a bunch of lazy professors fired

26:23.960 --> 26:26.480
by invoking a
"revolutionary vigilance"?

26:26.480 --> 26:30.319
Oh, yes. My revolutionary phase.

26:30.319 --> 26:32.839
I have to say,
I don't really miss it at all.

26:33.680 --> 26:35.359
- Who is this--?
- If I were you,

26:35.359 --> 26:37.440
I would miss that former vigilance.

26:39.640 --> 26:40.880
To vigilance.

26:44.160 --> 26:45.400
Victor.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.480
I don't really give a shit

26:50.480 --> 26:54.240
about how many of these people
you think you own. I know...

26:55.880 --> 26:57.240
about your warehouse.

27:26.759 --> 27:28.200
Is that a new bag?

27:28.920 --> 27:31.000
Yes, the seamstress
gave it as a gift.

27:36.720 --> 27:37.960
What are you doing?

27:38.559 --> 27:41.839
- You should've said it was a gift.
- What's wrong?

27:50.599 --> 27:52.160
[crowd applauding]

28:08.960 --> 28:10.359
Hey, Victor.

28:10.359 --> 28:13.279
How long does this damn thing take?
I'm already sweating.

28:13.279 --> 28:15.519
- Two hours.
- What?

28:15.519 --> 28:18.039
That's too much.
Tell them to make it one.

28:18.039 --> 28:20.079
I'm afraid that is not possible.

28:22.000 --> 28:23.799
Okay then. Let's begin.

28:23.799 --> 28:25.720
[orchestra playing classical music]

28:39.759 --> 28:41.319
Is that Mircea's redhead?

28:44.400 --> 28:46.240
She's not as pretty as I assumed.

28:46.240 --> 28:49.200
But I'm not surprised.
He's got terrible taste in women.

28:50.160 --> 28:52.359
A man his age who has no children,

28:52.359 --> 28:54.640
there's got to be
something wrong with him.

29:03.799 --> 29:05.559
Did you enjoy the concert?

29:06.160 --> 29:07.599
Yeah, I loved it.

29:07.599 --> 29:10.079
And everybody who was there
was so nice to us.

29:10.759 --> 29:12.839
When I grow up,
I wanna be just like you.

29:14.519 --> 29:17.200
You should be like you, not like me.

29:18.000 --> 29:19.960
Yeah. I'm gonna be a famous artist,

29:19.960 --> 29:22.440
but with your power
and your influence.

29:25.079 --> 29:27.920
Power is a hungry animal,
you realize, Ileana.

29:28.519 --> 29:30.799
You'll teach me
how to control it, won't you?

29:35.319 --> 29:36.559
Are you tired yet?

29:37.680 --> 29:39.160
I want to show you something.

29:51.759 --> 29:53.039
What are we doing here?

29:54.559 --> 29:57.680
The people who live here
live on a fraction of what you have.

29:58.680 --> 30:02.359
Do you think they don't want more?
Of course they do.

30:02.359 --> 30:04.799
Do you know why they don't go for it?

30:06.559 --> 30:08.319
Not because they are powerless.

30:12.480 --> 30:15.359
It's because they don't know
how to work the system.

30:16.039 --> 30:17.279
I don't get it.

30:19.880 --> 30:21.279
This is where I was born.

30:33.319 --> 30:34.720
[pensive music playing]

30:45.160 --> 30:46.599
I need you to understand.

30:46.599 --> 30:50.480
You can't travel when you want,
you can't buy everything you want,

30:50.480 --> 30:53.000
and you can't draw anything you want.

30:55.160 --> 30:58.279
"He who bows his head
misses the sword."

30:58.279 --> 31:01.920
I need you to remember that.
Even when I'm not here with you.

31:01.920 --> 31:05.240
- It's important.
- But you don't bow your head, Dad.

31:09.079 --> 31:10.920
Actually, I had to at first.

31:12.680 --> 31:14.599
The only reason I have power now

31:14.599 --> 31:17.119
is because I learned
the limits of the system

31:17.119 --> 31:19.480
and how to push them
without overstepping.

31:20.359 --> 31:23.440
Because if you overstep, it's over.

31:24.119 --> 31:26.720
Goodbye. Off to prison.

31:26.720 --> 31:28.039
Or even worse.

31:29.480 --> 31:31.880
Sweetheart,
I'm not trying to scare you.

31:32.559 --> 31:35.720
But you have to learn these things
if you want to survive.

31:36.799 --> 31:39.119
And all I want is for you to survive.

31:55.039 --> 31:56.359
[knock on door]

for tonight. I'm pretty tired.

32:07.880 --> 32:10.240
I've booked our flights home already.

32:10.240 --> 32:12.480
We're leaving
at 9:00 tomorrow morning, so...

Perfect. Thanks.

- Good day.

32:51.519 --> 32:54.200

- Vodka.

is defecting to the Americans.

Hey.

- You forgot, didn't you?
- I didn't forget.

33:19.799 --> 33:21.720
You have no idea
what I'm talking about.

33:21.720 --> 33:24.119

33:24.119 --> 33:25.440

Shakarov?

36:04.920 --> 36:06.440
When were all these taken?

36:07.199 --> 36:08.440
In May.

36:09.800 --> 36:12.719
The meetings have been going on
for about six months now.

36:13.519 --> 36:14.960
None were ever reported.

36:18.840 --> 36:20.880
Are you sure
these photos aren't fake?

36:22.400 --> 36:24.559
I'm sure they are real,
Comrade Ceaușescu.

36:28.639 --> 36:30.840
Victor is not only a smuggler.

36:32.679 --> 36:35.719
It looks like
he's our KGB mole as well.

36:36.519 --> 36:37.760
Impossible.

36:39.199 --> 36:42.519
I know Victor is not a saint.
This is madness, though.

36:43.159 --> 36:44.920
I know you have a vested interest.

36:45.519 --> 36:47.079
- I do?
- You do.

36:47.079 --> 36:48.639
[Mircea] What do you mean?

36:48.639 --> 36:51.159
He's having an affair
with a Russian student.

36:51.159 --> 36:53.079
Is that who gave you these photos?

36:53.559 --> 36:55.639
Comrade Elena Ceaușescu, respectfully,

36:55.639 --> 36:57.800
I am not having an affair
with any Russian.

36:57.800 --> 36:59.280
[Elena] You're a liar!

36:59.280 --> 37:03.039
We received these photos from one of
our most loyal agents on our team.

37:06.960 --> 37:08.280
Leave these here.

37:09.400 --> 37:10.639
You may go.

37:11.360 --> 37:13.000
Don't say anything.

Not a word of this nonsense
to anyone.

37:17.039 --> 37:19.159
I want to assure you,
Comrade Ceaușescu.

37:19.719 --> 37:23.039
I have no other interest
than serving the Party and Romania.

- Why are you here again?
- I know what you're planning to do.

You don't belong with the Americans.

37:55.440 --> 37:57.480

Good evening, Victor.

44:07.320 --> 44:08.840
Why don't you get in?

44:41.079 --> 44:42.719
[man speaking indistinctly]

45:02.320 --> 45:03.559
How are you, Victor?

45:05.719 --> 45:07.239
How is life treating you?

45:12.400 --> 45:13.880
I can't really complain.

45:15.760 --> 45:17.159
This won't take long.

45:19.360 --> 45:21.239
I know you have a rendezvous.

45:23.360 --> 45:24.719
I hope it can wait.

45:27.239 --> 45:29.119
How was your trip to Germany?

45:30.599 --> 45:33.039
Did you manage to do some work too?

45:33.039 --> 45:37.039
Or did you just spend time
chatting up pretty German girls?

45:37.039 --> 45:38.360
[Shakarov chuckles]

45:42.440 --> 45:48.559
I've negotiated the repatriation
of German Romanians.

45:48.559 --> 45:54.440
It's always touching
when one can bring families together.

45:56.760 --> 45:59.480
Got news to share
about our common friend?

46:00.199 --> 46:04.000
In a few months, Ceaușescu will be
visiting the Queen of England.

46:05.119 --> 46:06.760
Mm, yes.

46:08.400 --> 46:11.599
I have a feeling that
you won't be joining him, will you?

46:15.639 --> 46:18.079
I have to say
that after all this time,

46:18.079 --> 46:20.519
I expected
more loyalty from you, Victor.

46:22.119 --> 46:24.400
I have been loyal for a long time.

46:26.639 --> 46:28.280
You want to know something?

46:28.960 --> 46:30.239
Here in our world,

46:31.039 --> 46:33.679
loyalty is an allegiance
that lasts forever.

46:34.760 --> 46:36.639
Or it's nothing at all.

46:36.639 --> 46:38.840
There's nothing that lasts forever.

46:38.840 --> 46:40.400
Yes, there is.

46:41.280 --> 46:44.119
Because for the right price,
anything can last.

47:27.639 --> 47:29.719
[choir singing hymn]

47:52.280 --> 47:54.360
I'm going to exit door left.

47:54.360 --> 47:58.239
Give me one minute and there'll be
a car waiting outside.

48:38.239 --> 48:40.039
["Free Man Falling" playing]

48:49.480 --> 48:53.639
Õ I feel I'm going crazy, baby Õ

48:55.159 --> 48:59.639
<i>Õ And that is all
That's left to say Õ</i>

49:01.079 --> 49:04.880
Õ Saddest part is that I'm ready Õ

49:06.360 --> 49:10.320
Õ To leave our home behind to die Õ

49:11.239 --> 49:14.960
<i>Õ Embracing shadows
Of the moonlight Õ</i>

49:16.800 --> 49:20.519
Õ It breaks my heart to see you cry Õ

49:22.559 --> 49:26.320
Õ I lost it all for heavy reasons Õ

49:28.039 --> 49:32.039
Õ At least I feel alive now Õ

49:32.599 --> 49:39.159
<i>Õ But, baby, havens close
Bridges burn one by one Õ</i>

49:39.159 --> 49:42.119
Õ Darker, darker Õ

49:42.119 --> 49:45.000
Õ 'Cause I'm a free man fallin' Õ

49:45.000 --> 49:49.840
Õ Faint stars fading off one by one Õ

49:49.840 --> 49:53.440
Õ You like it, lying Õ

49:53.440 --> 49:56.079
Õ 'Cause I'm a free man fallin' Õ

50:00.119 --> 50:02.360
Õ I'm a free man falling down Õ

50:04.599 --> 50:06.880
Õ Yeah, I'm a free man fallin' Õ

50:11.159 --> 50:13.760
Õ A free man falling down Õ
