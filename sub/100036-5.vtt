WEBVTT

00:01.202 --> 00:02.970
Previously on This Is Us...

00:03.003 --> 00:04.072
KEVIN:
You want your husband back?

00:04.105 --> 00:06.640
Yes.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.576
Well, then we should
get him back.

00:08.609 --> 00:11.912
I think it's time we got out
of this place, you know?

00:11.945 --> 00:13.981
Get into a home.

00:14.014 --> 00:18.219
And start a new chapter.

00:18.252 --> 00:20.888
-(phone beeps)
-Hey, Mom, it's Kevin.

00:20.921 --> 00:22.856
I got married,
uh, to Sophie, yeah.

00:22.890 --> 00:24.892
Got married to Sophie.

00:36.237 --> 00:37.571
Babe?

00:37.605 --> 00:40.508
I can't find it.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.610
Hey, what about this?
Will this do?

00:42.643 --> 00:44.278
We can't have our first dinner

00:44.312 --> 00:46.414
in our first house
on terrycloth.

00:46.447 --> 00:48.015
(gasps)
Found it.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.684
See? This is perfect.

00:50.718 --> 00:53.087
It's gonna look so good
on our table...

00:53.121 --> 00:56.390
-Where's our table?
-Finding table.

01:02.430 --> 01:05.466
-Hey.
-Morning.
How'd you sleep?

01:05.499 --> 01:07.801
Weird. I kept waking up
and forgetting where I was.

01:07.835 --> 01:11.239
Me, too. I mean,
we only moved in a month ago.

01:11.272 --> 01:12.540
I feel like it's gonna take
some time

01:12.573 --> 01:13.741
for it to feel like home.

01:13.774 --> 01:15.876
Can you grab me
that other chair?

01:15.909 --> 01:17.145
Please, Bug?

01:17.178 --> 01:19.380
Do you really think
a fancy dinner is gonna make it

01:19.413 --> 01:21.115
less bizarre that Kevin
got married

01:21.149 --> 01:23.083
five years after puberty?

01:23.117 --> 01:25.052
He doesn't even understand
how a checking account works.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.720
Kate, we've talked about this.

01:26.754 --> 01:30.891
What's done is done. Now
we just have to support them.

01:30.924 --> 01:33.127
I actually think it'll be fun
to have something to celebrate.

01:33.161 --> 01:35.729
Randall's bringing
his new girlfriend,

01:35.763 --> 01:38.098
Miguel's gonna bring
some fancy bottle of wine...

01:38.132 --> 01:40.334
And a sleeping bag.

01:40.368 --> 01:43.637
What?
He's here all the time.

01:43.671 --> 01:45.973
He also talked the Realtor down
and fixed the gutters.

01:46.006 --> 01:48.108
So I think that at least
deserves a dinner invitation.

01:48.142 --> 01:50.844
I'm off to work.

01:50.878 --> 01:53.080
Hey, how is work, by the way?

01:53.113 --> 01:55.082
You seem to really
be liking it.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.985
Yeah, it's okay.
A little boring.

01:58.018 --> 02:01.155
(moaning)

02:01.189 --> 02:03.090
MAN:
Hey, does anyone
actually work here?

02:03.123 --> 02:04.458
(both laughing)

02:04.492 --> 02:06.527
-Go.
-I know, I'm gonna go.

02:07.495 --> 02:09.630
MAN:
Hello.

02:09.663 --> 02:11.832
-Yeah. Coming.
-(door closes)

02:19.640 --> 02:22.009
Baby, slow down.

02:22.042 --> 02:23.677
I have to go over
my science presentation,

02:23.711 --> 02:26.880
proof my English essay,
and review my Spanish vocab

02:26.914 --> 02:28.015
before school.

02:28.048 --> 02:29.717
All right, well,
what's Spanish for "chew"?

02:29.750 --> 02:32.786
-Masticar.
-Then do that.

02:32.820 --> 02:35.689
Good morning,
my breakfast beauties.

02:35.723 --> 02:37.124
Who's ready to own this day?

02:37.157 --> 02:39.126
Hey, you were out
early this morning.

02:39.159 --> 02:41.662
-I didn't even see you.
-TESS: I did.

02:41.695 --> 02:43.497
That's right.
'Cause we're early birds.

02:43.531 --> 02:46.066
-Getting that worm.
-(whoops)

02:46.099 --> 02:49.637
Ten miles. Best time.
No big deal.

02:49.670 --> 02:51.972
Ten miles? What are you,
training for a marathon?

02:52.005 --> 02:54.074
I just felt good
and I kept going.

02:54.107 --> 02:56.910
Hey, Dej. Cereal?

02:56.944 --> 02:59.880
One-third Corn Flakes,
two-thirds Cheerios,

02:59.913 --> 03:00.981
just like you like it.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.916
You think cereal is
gonna make me forget

03:02.950 --> 03:05.085
you treat me like a child
who can't make her own decisions

03:05.118 --> 03:06.186
about who to date?

03:06.220 --> 03:08.722
That was the plan.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.190
(quietly):
Okay.

03:10.224 --> 03:13.227
-(phone rings)
-You're gonna need
a better plan, man.

03:13.261 --> 03:15.496
Yeah.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.697
Hey, Kate.

03:16.730 --> 03:18.699
Okay, you have to tell me
what the baby gift is.

03:18.732 --> 03:21.068
I don't.
It'll ruin the surprise.

03:21.101 --> 03:22.770
Oh, is it a pony?

03:22.803 --> 03:24.672
Huh, Randall?
I'd love a pony.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.007
Or a, or a hot tub.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.609
For a baby?

03:28.642 --> 03:29.943
Look, I don't know.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.179
The Pearson men are known
for their grand gestures.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.447
It could be literally anything.

03:33.481 --> 03:35.383
-Yeah.
-In the meantime, listen,
I got to go.

03:35.416 --> 03:38.452
I'm off to the gun show.
All right.

03:38.486 --> 03:40.754
Love you.
Bye, Randall.

03:40.788 --> 03:42.189
It's not a pony or a hot tub.

03:42.222 --> 03:43.724
But it is from me and Kevin.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.393
He made me promise
I'd tell you that.

03:45.426 --> 03:47.428
Even though it was my idea,
and I did everything

03:47.461 --> 03:48.462
while he did nothing.

03:48.496 --> 03:50.798
So you call me first
when it gets there.

03:50.831 --> 03:53.767
Okay. Hey, um...

03:53.801 --> 03:55.102
I'm worried about Kev.

03:55.135 --> 03:56.604
I mean, he bought a trailer?

03:56.637 --> 03:57.805
In Pennsylvania?

04:07.448 --> 04:09.116
Quiet's nice, huh?

04:11.419 --> 04:13.587
It was.

04:13.621 --> 04:18.225
So... what was it like
growing up with my dad?

04:18.258 --> 04:20.461
Hmm? Tell me a story
about his childhood.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.998
He liked ice cream.

04:29.269 --> 04:30.804
Yeah. That's a good story.

04:30.838 --> 04:33.641
That's-that's a great story. Uh,
I'm gonna expand on that a bit.

04:33.674 --> 04:36.644
I remember when I was a kid,
my dad used to come home,

04:36.677 --> 04:40.280
sometimes he'd bring these, uh,
these cartons of ice cream.

04:42.450 --> 04:44.852
You know, the, the ones
with the cardboard sides

04:44.885 --> 04:45.986
that you'd fold down,

04:46.019 --> 04:48.656
leaving just a brick
of ice cream?

04:48.689 --> 04:51.992
Anyway, he'd, um...
(chuckles)

04:52.025 --> 04:53.361
-Right there?
-Right there.

04:53.394 --> 04:55.463
KEVIN:
He'd cut it
like it was a cake.

04:55.496 --> 04:57.331
Big old cut, oh!

05:03.737 --> 05:05.238
God, I really loved that.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.814
Nothing. Okay, great.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.716
(sighs)

05:15.749 --> 05:18.686
-(exhales)
-Mm. You, uh,
you looking forward

05:18.719 --> 05:20.788
-to the hockey game today?
-Yeah, I was.

05:20.821 --> 05:24.324
-Yeah.
-But then I remembered
I don't really want to go, so...

05:24.358 --> 05:26.660
Listen, they're honoring vets
at tonight's game.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.295
They're inviting Cassidy
down on the ice,

05:28.328 --> 05:29.530
it's a whole thing.

05:29.563 --> 05:30.864
Plus I might have told her

05:30.898 --> 05:32.332
I'd help her win
her husband back.

05:32.366 --> 05:35.503
You... have

05:35.536 --> 05:37.805
strange relationships
with people.

05:37.838 --> 05:41.475
Might be the nicest thing
you ever said to me.

05:41.509 --> 05:43.310
Councilman.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.413
Ah... there's the man
that stood me up for drinks.

05:45.446 --> 05:46.847
Thank you for meeting me.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.750
I'm really sorry
about the other night.

05:49.783 --> 05:51.184
I hate missing a good Scotch

05:51.218 --> 05:53.086
and a healthy debate
on gentrification.

05:53.120 --> 05:55.889
Well, it didn't sit too well
with a few councilmen

05:55.923 --> 05:59.092
that you obviously had
better things to do, but we

05:59.126 --> 06:02.329
consoled ourselves with steaks
at Del Frisco's afterward.

06:02.362 --> 06:05.065
-Yeah... (chuckles)
-(phone rings)

06:05.098 --> 06:08.368
Ah, excuse me,
this is my daughter's school.

06:08.402 --> 06:11.204
Hello.
Yes.

06:14.608 --> 06:19.413
So, did you talk to my wife?
She didn't?

06:19.447 --> 06:23.216
Okay. Um, I will be right there.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.688
Councilman, I'm so sorry,
I have to go.

06:27.721 --> 06:31.091
Um... my daughter
had a panic attack.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.831
(sighs)

06:40.468 --> 06:42.470
*

06:53.080 --> 06:55.949
Okay.
Two of the legs are now

06:55.983 --> 06:58.486
officially attached.
We just have to find the others.

06:58.519 --> 07:00.220
Where is the big pot?

07:00.253 --> 07:02.322
I can't make lasagna
without the big pot.

07:02.355 --> 07:05.325
Oh, baby, that's a problem,
because I-I'm starving.

07:05.358 --> 07:07.227
And I think, I think
I might have forgotten

07:07.260 --> 07:08.829
to pack the big pot.

07:08.862 --> 07:12.500
How about an hors d'oeuvre
to tide you over, good sir?

07:12.533 --> 07:14.367
-Thanks.
-Hmm?

07:16.670 --> 07:19.106
-(chuckles)
-Bon appÃ©tit.

07:19.139 --> 07:20.774
Aw.

07:22.676 --> 07:25.579
I hope the salmon's not chewy.

07:25.613 --> 07:28.281
-No, it's good. (laughs)
-Uh, it's okay if you
don't like salmon,

07:28.315 --> 07:29.583
you know, or are allergic.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.952
I totally forgot to ask
about dietary restrictions.

07:31.985 --> 07:33.554
Uh, I-I like salmon.

07:35.623 --> 07:37.190
What do you think, guys?
Should I, uh, open the wine

07:37.224 --> 07:41.161
and let it breathe
before Kev and Sophie get here?

07:41.194 --> 07:43.631
Yeah. I'll open the wine
and let it breathe.

07:43.664 --> 07:47.434
(gasps) I forgot the dill
garnish. Hold on.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.469
Ah, yes. Because a garnish
will make it less crazy

07:49.503 --> 07:50.504
that Kevin got married.

07:50.538 --> 07:52.372
-Kate, come on.
-It's true.

08:02.683 --> 08:05.719
RANDALL:
I keep a list of things to fix
around the house

08:05.753 --> 08:08.121
'cause my mom needs help
now that she's alone.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.123
KATE:
Oh, actually, she's not alone.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.925
I'm here all the time.

08:12.926 --> 08:15.796
REBECCA:
All right, I got the garnish.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.364
BETH:
Oh, that reminds me.

08:17.397 --> 08:19.166
I brought
a housewarming present.

08:19.199 --> 08:20.734
What?

08:20.768 --> 08:22.069
-(chuckles)
-BETH: Tonight.

08:22.102 --> 08:24.672
Um, there's a story behind it.

08:24.705 --> 08:27.040
Don't worry. It's...

08:30.510 --> 08:32.245
What, d-does everybody
hate hot sauce,

08:32.279 --> 08:34.181
-or...?
-No, no, no. Um...

08:34.214 --> 08:36.884
It's just that, uh...

08:36.917 --> 08:38.686
Jack used to put hot sauce

08:38.719 --> 08:39.753
-on everything.
-(Miguel chuckles)

08:42.790 --> 08:46.326
Uh, my dad loved hot sauce, too.
(chuckles)

08:46.359 --> 08:48.195
So much so

08:48.228 --> 08:50.030
that he brought a bottle of it
wherever he went.

08:50.063 --> 08:53.734
Um, as a gift,
but it wasn't actually a gift.

08:53.767 --> 08:56.503
He just wanted to make sure
he always had hot sauce.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.606
Um, yeah, he put it on-on eggs

08:58.639 --> 09:00.608
and put it on burgers.

09:00.641 --> 09:03.611
(chuckles): Um, one time,
he even put it on Froyo.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.779
-(Randall laughs)
-Yeah, after he died,

09:05.813 --> 09:09.817
I started bringing it
as a gift, too.

09:10.818 --> 09:14.087
-Well, thank you.
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

09:14.121 --> 09:15.422
(chuckles)

09:15.455 --> 09:17.190
(doorbell rings)

09:17.224 --> 09:19.159
Oh, that must be them.

09:20.661 --> 09:23.864
-Hey. This is weird, right?
-(door opens)

09:23.897 --> 09:25.565
-KEVIN: Hi, Mom.
-REBECCA: Look at you guys.

09:25.599 --> 09:27.034
Let's try to be supportive
for Mom.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.368
REBECCA:
There they are.

09:28.401 --> 09:29.536
Oh, my goodness!

09:29.569 --> 09:30.971
Come on in. Come in.

09:31.004 --> 09:34.975
Uh, wife,
would you like to enter?

09:35.008 --> 09:36.644
Yes, husband.

09:36.677 --> 09:37.878
-Okay.
-(Sophie giggles)

09:37.911 --> 09:40.113
(squeals, laughs)

09:40.147 --> 09:42.582
-This is how
we enter buildings now.
-(Rebecca chuckles)

09:42.616 --> 09:44.051
-REBECCA: Okay.
-KEVIN: Yeah.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.485
Now, that's weird.

09:45.518 --> 09:47.821
Thank you.

09:55.663 --> 09:57.631
You want to talk about it?

09:57.665 --> 10:01.101
-'Cause I know
a thing or two about...
-Please, no.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.347
You know, it's okay.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.684
Happens to me, too.

10:16.717 --> 10:19.319
Sometimes it just comes
out of nowhere.

10:19.352 --> 10:22.923
Like when I have a lot of stuff
going on in my life.

10:22.956 --> 10:24.825
(gasping)

10:27.695 --> 10:29.663
I won't even know
that I'm feeling that way,

10:29.697 --> 10:33.100
and then it just catches up
to me all of a sudden.

10:33.133 --> 10:34.968
BETH:
Hey, baby.

10:35.002 --> 10:37.304
I left the studio right away.

10:37.337 --> 10:40.874
-Are you okay?
-RANDALL: Yeah, she's okay.

10:40.908 --> 10:42.776
The nurse said she had
a little trouble breathing

10:42.810 --> 10:44.611
and a rapid heart rate.

10:44.644 --> 10:48.048
Probably brought on
by some anxiety.

10:49.582 --> 10:51.284
Is that what's going on? Huh?

10:51.318 --> 10:53.353
-Feeling a little anxious?
-I don't know.

10:53.386 --> 10:55.188
-I guess.
-RANDALL: It makes sense.

10:55.222 --> 10:58.325
There's a lot happening.
New school, friends.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.728
You put a lot of pressure
on yourself with your grades.

11:00.761 --> 11:03.496
-I think you get that from me.
-S-Stop.

11:03.530 --> 11:05.665
Stop saying I'm like you.

11:05.699 --> 11:08.368
I don't want to be
anything like you.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.846
Hey, don't you, uh,
don't you have one of those

11:18.879 --> 11:20.881
Vietnam baseball hats
you could wear or something?

11:20.914 --> 11:22.682
You know?

11:22.716 --> 11:25.518
You know, it's not like it's a-a
concert we all went to, Kevin.

11:25.552 --> 11:28.255
No, no, it's, it's-- I'm just
saying, like, it would be nice

11:28.288 --> 11:30.057
if other people could recognize
you for your service.

11:30.090 --> 11:31.859
You know what I mean? That's
sort of what this whole thing

11:31.892 --> 11:33.861
is all about.

11:33.894 --> 11:36.063
You know what would be nice?

11:36.096 --> 11:38.065
If I could just drink,
like, ten beers in a row,

11:38.098 --> 11:41.101
you know,
just to get through this.

11:41.134 --> 11:42.535
Relax. I'm kidding.

11:42.569 --> 11:44.104
I prefer whiskey.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.106
-You made it.
-Hey!

11:46.139 --> 11:48.175
Hey, congrats on the whole, uh,
you know, your whole thing.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.177
-Oh. I guess.
-Yeah.

11:50.210 --> 11:54.414
Um, Matty's dad's
coming to the ceremony, so...

11:54.447 --> 11:56.083
Oh, okay.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.918
Shut up.

11:57.951 --> 12:00.553
He's just being a good dad.
He's bringing his son

12:00.587 --> 12:03.256
-to see people clap for his mom.
-MATTY: Mom!

12:03.290 --> 12:05.225
-Hey.
-Kevin!
-KEVIN: What's up, buddy?

12:05.258 --> 12:07.127
-Hi, bud.
-What do you say?
Get me up high.

12:07.160 --> 12:10.363
There it is. Nice vertical.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.365
-CASSIDY: Hi.
-Hey.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.134
Thanks for coming.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.036
MATTY:
Dad!

12:16.069 --> 12:17.771
Dad, this is Kevin.
Isn't he cool

12:17.805 --> 12:19.439
-like I said he was?
-Nah, come on. You know what?

12:19.472 --> 12:21.708
You buy a kid one Kit Kat.
Good to meet you, Ryan.

12:21.741 --> 12:23.710
Ah, glad to finally meet
the adult man

12:23.743 --> 12:25.645
that my nine-year-old son
keeps saying

12:25.678 --> 12:26.914
is one of his best friends.

12:28.148 --> 12:30.017
-Okay. Come on.
-MATTY: Okay.

12:33.653 --> 12:37.090
You really do have the strangest
relationships with people.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.165
*

12:49.870 --> 12:51.671
I couldn't find
the fourth table leg,

12:51.704 --> 12:54.307
so we're just gonna have
to eat on the strong corner.

12:54.341 --> 12:57.344
Babe, you're already
cooking three babies

12:57.377 --> 12:59.512
in your belly, okay?
You don't have to do this.

12:59.546 --> 13:01.148
It's our first night
in our new home,

13:01.181 --> 13:03.516
and I want everything
to be just right.

13:03.550 --> 13:06.253
-Okay.
-Here.

13:06.286 --> 13:09.289
-Start on your salad.
-Huh.

13:13.861 --> 13:15.262
Hey, Kev.

13:15.295 --> 13:17.430
You recognize the salad recipe?

13:17.464 --> 13:19.366
It's Emeril Lagasse.

13:19.399 --> 13:22.469
-Who?
-Emeril Lagasse, you know,

13:22.502 --> 13:24.337
the chef that goes "Bam."
We watched him together

13:24.371 --> 13:25.973
all last year.

13:26.006 --> 13:28.175
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Bam.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.043
-Yeah. This is him.
-Yeah, totally.

13:30.077 --> 13:31.478
(quietly):
Awesome.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.380
(clears throat)

13:36.049 --> 13:37.851
So how come you guys
got married?

13:37.885 --> 13:39.386
SOPHIE:
Mm. It was a sign.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.221
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm. Tell them.

13:41.254 --> 13:43.390
So, I'm walking down the street
in New York.

13:43.423 --> 13:45.292
-REBECCA: Mm-hmm.
-Beautiful day.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.528
I'm thinking about how lucky
I am to be with Sophie,

13:48.561 --> 13:51.531
and I look up and I happen
to be in front of a theater

13:51.564 --> 13:53.200
playing The Princess Bride.

13:53.233 --> 13:54.634
-Oh.
-SOPHIE: Our favorite movie.

13:54.667 --> 13:55.802
-KEVIN: Yeah.
-Yeah.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.404
-(laughter)
-KEVIN: Yeah.

13:57.437 --> 13:58.972
Oh, so, then,
that was the sign...

13:59.006 --> 14:00.573
KEVIN:
No, not all of it.

14:00.607 --> 14:03.010
No, no, no. Um, across
the street, there's a church

14:03.043 --> 14:05.812
that starts ringing its bells
and, like, two seconds later,

14:05.845 --> 14:08.081
-a street vendor
walks up selling...
-RANDALL: Rings.

14:08.115 --> 14:09.516
-Bracelets,
but definitely jewelry.
-Yes.

14:09.549 --> 14:12.419
-Yeah. Um, and, yeah.
-(Sophie laughs)

14:12.452 --> 14:17.424
In that moment,
I just realized that, um,

14:17.457 --> 14:20.928
I couldn't wait another second
to start our lives together.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.562
So...

14:22.595 --> 14:24.664
And how could I say no to that?
(laughs)

14:24.697 --> 14:26.599
Aw.

14:26.633 --> 14:27.700
You want to see
the wedding photos?

14:27.734 --> 14:30.003
Yes. Please.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.538
MIGUEL:
Of course.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.040
SOPHIE:
I picked up the camera
at a Duane Reade

14:33.073 --> 14:35.075
on the way to the courthouse.
(chuckles)

14:35.108 --> 14:37.911
Uh...
(laughs softly)

14:37.945 --> 14:40.780
-Oh, Polaroids.
-MIGUEL: Ooh, I want to see.

14:40.813 --> 14:42.282
-KEVIN: We did a lot of 'em.
-(doorbell rings)

14:42.315 --> 14:43.883
REBECCA:
Oh, I'll pass them around.

14:43.917 --> 14:45.618
-I'll get it.
-BETH: Wow.

14:45.652 --> 14:46.753
(indistinct chatter)

14:46.786 --> 14:48.255
Hey.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.223
Hi. What are you doing here?

14:50.257 --> 14:53.226
Well, I didn't want you to have
to go through tonight alone.

14:53.260 --> 14:57.297
So, just got your address
off your application and I, uh,

14:57.330 --> 15:01.401
picked your neighbor's daisies
and, uh, here I am, so...

15:01.434 --> 15:03.803
Oh. That's so romantic.

15:03.836 --> 15:05.438
-Yeah.
-And a little creepy.

15:05.472 --> 15:07.074
-That's me, just all together.
-(chuckles)

15:07.107 --> 15:08.741
REBECCA:
Hey, Bug? Who is it?

15:08.775 --> 15:10.910
You sure you want to do this?

15:10.944 --> 15:12.812
Bug? Oh, absolutely. Yeah.

15:12.845 --> 15:14.281
-Okay. Come on.
-Definitely.

15:14.314 --> 15:17.650
Everyone, um,
this is my friend from work.

15:17.684 --> 15:20.220
-Hi.
-Hi.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.421
Oh, I'm Marc.

15:21.454 --> 15:23.890
I'm... Kate's boyfriend.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.326
Uh... yeah.

15:30.297 --> 15:33.100
(announcer speaking
indistinctly)

15:33.133 --> 15:36.069
You, uh, you and Cassidy
go to a lot of games?

15:36.103 --> 15:38.171
She must be fun
at the hockey games, huh?

15:38.205 --> 15:40.173
-I've never been. I hate hockey.
-Yeah.

15:40.207 --> 15:41.908
Yeah, yeah. Hockey sucks.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.143
Just awful.

15:53.620 --> 15:54.821
(loud clatter)

15:56.623 --> 15:57.657
(buzzer sounds)

15:57.690 --> 15:59.092
(applause)

15:59.126 --> 16:01.428
I'm out of here.

16:01.461 --> 16:02.762
What do you mean?
You're not-- the ceremony

16:02.795 --> 16:03.963
hasn't even started yet.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.365
Uncle Nicky. Hey.

16:05.398 --> 16:08.201
-I don't feel good here, Kevin.
-Pardon me. Hey.

16:08.235 --> 16:11.138
Where are you, where are you
gonna go? You gonna go to a bar?

16:11.171 --> 16:12.672
No, I just need to be
somewhere else.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.941
-Well, let me go with you.
-No, alone.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.377
I'm fine. Please.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.650
Randall, you have to call me
back and tell me

16:23.683 --> 16:25.185
when this present
is getting here. Okay?

16:25.218 --> 16:26.886
I'm trapped in my house
with a tiny sleeping baby

16:26.919 --> 16:28.521
and a dog who has to pee.

16:28.555 --> 16:30.557
There's just no way
that this grand gesture

16:30.590 --> 16:31.791
is going to be worth it.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.394
Call me back. Bye.

16:34.427 --> 16:35.828
(doorbell rings)

16:35.862 --> 16:37.697
It's here? Oh, my gosh.

16:37.730 --> 16:39.832
Okay.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.536
Hi.

16:43.570 --> 16:45.872
Are you my present?

16:45.905 --> 16:47.974
(chuckles)
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

16:48.007 --> 16:49.976
-Oh...
-No, I came to see the baby.

16:50.009 --> 16:52.011
Okay.

16:54.547 --> 16:55.848
-MARC: Very cool.
-REBECCA: So, your favorite band

16:55.882 --> 16:57.750
is called Modest Mouse?

16:57.784 --> 16:59.819
-(chuckles): Mm-hmm.
-Now, wait a minute,
is-is that a band

16:59.852 --> 17:01.988
or a shy cartoon character?

17:02.021 --> 17:04.324
-(soft laughter)
-KATE: No, it's actually from

17:04.357 --> 17:06.059
-a Virginia Woolf short story.
-MARC: Uh, yeah. And, um,

17:06.093 --> 17:09.062
and so, like, the lead singer,
uh, like, he got started

17:09.096 --> 17:11.598
by recording just, like,
these crazy experimental songs

17:11.631 --> 17:13.933
with a distortion pedal
on his answering machine

17:13.966 --> 17:16.503
and stuff like that,
so, you know...

17:16.536 --> 17:17.904
-REBECCA: Uh-huh.
-...it's pretty cool.

17:17.937 --> 17:19.406
-REBECCA: Very cool.
-MIGUEL: So cool.
-Yeah.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.410
So, what do you guys
think of Marc?

17:23.443 --> 17:26.045
Oh, he seems like he's really
into obscure music facts.

17:26.079 --> 17:28.748
That's kind of his job. Kevin?

17:28.781 --> 17:30.750
Uh, yeah, he's too old for you.

17:30.783 --> 17:33.453
-Definitely too old for you.
-Uh, he's 23.

17:33.486 --> 17:35.622
Dad was six years older
than Mom.

17:36.989 --> 17:38.458
How do you guys not like him?

17:38.491 --> 17:40.427
Okay? He was nothing
but nice to you.

17:40.460 --> 17:41.728
I personally don't have
a problem...

17:41.761 --> 17:42.929
I don't know,
it's just a feeling.

17:42.962 --> 17:45.031
Like that time Grandma
wanted us to try escargot.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.934
You know, we didn't need to try
it to know we didn't like it.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.869
Marc is escargot.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.038
-What do you guys think
about Beth? (chuckles)
-She's great.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.974
-RANDALL: Yeah? Cool.
-No, actually, she's perfect.

17:55.007 --> 17:57.210
She even has a beauty mark
on her eye. Didn't know

17:57.244 --> 17:59.646
that was a thing until now,
but it's adorable.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.448
-Unlike Marc.
-KEVIN: Kate, come on.

18:01.481 --> 18:04.083
You want me to lie? I love Marc.

18:04.117 --> 18:05.552
-He's my new favorite.
-You-- no, no. You know,

18:05.585 --> 18:07.720
I don't even care
about that, Kevin.

18:07.754 --> 18:10.089
You got married
without telling me. Okay?

18:10.123 --> 18:12.425
-I'm supposed to be your person.
-You know what?

18:12.459 --> 18:13.826
-It was spontaneous.
-I'm with Kate here.

18:13.860 --> 18:14.961
-Polaroids?
-REBECCA: Hey.

18:14.994 --> 18:16.396
What's going on in here?

18:16.429 --> 18:17.464
KEVIN:
Kate's freaking out.

18:17.497 --> 18:18.798
KATE:
No, Kev, I'm not freaking out.

18:18.831 --> 18:20.433
I'm just, I'm not gonna sit here

18:20.467 --> 18:23.170
and pretend that your
ridiculous marriage is real.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.405
(indistinct chatter)

18:25.438 --> 18:26.906
Man, so, who are you, again?

18:26.939 --> 18:29.176
KEVIN:
I don't know, Kate,
what are we supposed to do?

18:29.209 --> 18:31.144
-Stay here and be sad
all the time?
-RANDALL: Hey, bro, come on.

18:31.178 --> 18:32.579
-What? We're being honest,
right?
-Guys, stop.

18:32.612 --> 18:34.314
You are so selfish!

18:34.347 --> 18:36.916
-Enough. Enough!
-We should have been
at your wedding, Kevin.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.852
It is our first night
as a family together

18:39.886 --> 18:42.422
in our new house,
and I have spent weeks

18:42.455 --> 18:44.657
getting this place together
so that it would be perfect.

18:46.025 --> 18:48.861
Because this is where
we move forward.

18:48.895 --> 18:50.830
This is where
we sit around a table

18:50.863 --> 18:52.365
with napkins and placemats

18:52.399 --> 18:54.434
and laugh and celebrate
and eat Cornish game hens.

18:54.467 --> 18:57.604
And so help me, God,
that is what we are gonna do:

18:57.637 --> 19:00.273
move forward.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.008
And it doesn't matter that I
didn't have the right size pan

19:02.041 --> 19:05.178
and that the hens
are all squished together

19:05.212 --> 19:07.280
and they're burnt on the top
and raw on the bottom.

19:07.314 --> 19:09.182
It doesn't even matter that
Kevin doesn't remember Emeril,

19:09.216 --> 19:12.385
or that I have four whole
Polaroids of your wedding.

19:12.419 --> 19:15.688
So pull yourselves together,
pretend you like burnt raw food,

19:15.722 --> 19:18.291
get your whiny little asses
back out in those seats,

19:18.325 --> 19:20.993
and enjoy my damn dinner.

19:28.901 --> 19:30.737
(gasps)
Babe.

19:30.770 --> 19:32.772
Oh, no, no, no.
Wait for it, wait for it.

19:34.207 --> 19:36.209
You're a genius.

19:36.243 --> 19:38.345
-Yeah. I know.
-(laughs)

19:38.378 --> 19:39.812
Here. I can help.

19:39.846 --> 19:43.149
There we go.
Look how nice that is. Huh?

19:43.182 --> 19:44.584
What's that smell?

19:45.685 --> 19:47.354
Did you clean the oven out?

19:47.387 --> 19:48.988
I thought that you did.

19:49.021 --> 19:50.490
(chuckles)
What?

19:50.523 --> 19:51.524
(gasps)

19:51.558 --> 19:54.093
-Oh, God.
-JACK: Oh. Okay.

19:54.126 --> 19:56.763
Jack.

19:56.796 --> 19:59.031
Oh, man.

19:59.065 --> 20:00.667
Wow, baby.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.735
Still looks good.

20:02.769 --> 20:05.572
Okay?

20:20.052 --> 20:22.322
Can we get sick from this?

20:26.593 --> 20:28.595
So good.

20:29.996 --> 20:31.564
ANNOUNCER:
Ladies and gentlemen,

20:31.598 --> 20:33.366
please stand

20:33.400 --> 20:36.403
as we honor Bradford County's
Heroes of the Game.

20:36.436 --> 20:39.506
(applause)

20:40.840 --> 20:43.643
Please give a round of applause

20:43.676 --> 20:48.481
for U.S. Air Force
Second Lieutenant Alan Ellis.

20:48.515 --> 20:50.317
(applause)

20:50.350 --> 20:53.986
And U.S. Marine Corps
Staff Sergeant Cassidy Sharp.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.722
(applause)

20:55.755 --> 20:57.256
(whoops)

20:57.290 --> 20:59.091
Yeah!

21:06.132 --> 21:08.668
And finally,
let's show our support

21:08.701 --> 21:11.438
for U.S. Navy
Chief Petty Officer

21:11.471 --> 21:13.473
Jon Gutierrez.

21:15.007 --> 21:17.410
Hey, can you tell Cassidy
I had to take off?

21:17.444 --> 21:19.278
She can bring Matty home
whenever.

21:19.312 --> 21:21.280
We thank you
for your service and dedication

21:21.314 --> 21:23.783
to our nation's freedom.

21:23.816 --> 21:25.785
(takes deep breath)

21:25.818 --> 21:28.120
Yeah, she's been in her room
for an hour.

21:28.154 --> 21:29.789
We got to go talk to her.

21:29.822 --> 21:32.291
-Let me see if grilled cheese
can get her to talk.
-(phone chimes)

21:32.325 --> 21:33.793
You know,
she loves my grilled cheese.

21:42.234 --> 21:43.370
You okay?

21:44.637 --> 21:46.639
Yeah. I'm fine.

21:57.183 --> 21:59.185
*

22:00.653 --> 22:02.722
Growing up,
I never shared genetic traits

22:02.755 --> 22:05.358
with anyone I knew.

22:05.392 --> 22:08.027
And when you and I had kids,

22:08.060 --> 22:10.863
I couldn't wait to see
what they got from me.

22:10.897 --> 22:15.101
Would they have cute ears,
be able to roll their tongues?

22:19.171 --> 22:21.408
Having anxiety and panic attacks

22:21.441 --> 22:24.977
is the thing about myself
that I like the least,

22:25.011 --> 22:27.346
and I passed it on to her.

22:29.582 --> 22:32.585
I hate that I gave this to her.

22:47.066 --> 22:49.001
What did the doctors say?

22:49.035 --> 22:51.003
They want to keep him
another night.

22:51.037 --> 22:54.441
Um, see how he adjusts
to the medication.

22:55.875 --> 22:58.445
This must have been building
for a while.

23:00.246 --> 23:02.582
He feels things
getting away from him,

23:02.615 --> 23:03.916
and then he...

23:03.950 --> 23:06.586
works really hard
to rein 'em in.

23:06.619 --> 23:09.456
Like more time at the office,
more time at the gym.

23:09.489 --> 23:12.091
And then he just pushes himself

23:12.124 --> 23:14.561
harder and further and...

23:15.995 --> 23:18.064
I should have saw the signs.

23:19.298 --> 23:21.734
I had a tell when I was young.

23:23.636 --> 23:26.506
Really? You had anxiety, too?

23:29.476 --> 23:32.278
Back then
they didn't have a name for it.

23:32.311 --> 23:35.582
They said I was "fragile"
and "sensitive."

23:35.615 --> 23:39.351
But when it was happening to me,
I thought I was gonna die.

23:40.787 --> 23:43.556
My mother would help me
through it, though.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.992
She'd fill a glass
with seltzer water and tell me

23:46.025 --> 23:49.128
the inside of my mind was like
the bubbles bouncing around,

23:49.161 --> 23:51.498
trying to get out.

23:51.531 --> 23:54.266
And we'd watch together
until those bubbles settled.

23:54.300 --> 23:56.469
Eventually, I would settle, too.

23:59.606 --> 24:02.609
Beth, out of all the things
I could have passed down,

24:02.642 --> 24:05.144
I hate to think
that it was that.

24:10.049 --> 24:12.051
*

24:22.028 --> 24:25.464
Babe, come on, it's gonna be
perfect, it's gonna be perfect.

24:25.498 --> 24:26.833
-All right?
-Mm.

24:26.866 --> 24:28.768
All right?
You know, I think the smoke

24:28.801 --> 24:30.369
gave it a nice hickory flavor.

24:30.402 --> 24:32.471
(laughs softly)

24:32.505 --> 24:34.774
-REBECCA: Hickory lasagna.
-Hickory lasagna.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.809
-(Rebecca sighs)
-Mm-hmm.

24:36.843 --> 24:38.511
(kisses)
Mm-hmm.

24:38.545 --> 24:40.647
(chuckles)

24:45.652 --> 24:47.954
Hey, are, uh...

24:47.987 --> 24:49.889
are you okay?

24:52.158 --> 24:54.493
Am I trying too hard?

24:57.163 --> 24:58.665
Are we...

24:58.698 --> 25:00.700
are we unfixable?

25:04.436 --> 25:07.874
Maybe this loss is just...

25:07.907 --> 25:09.742
(softly):
too big.

25:09.776 --> 25:11.744
You know?

25:11.778 --> 25:13.746
Uh, you know, those...

25:13.780 --> 25:16.348
those sound like questions
that can only be answered

25:16.382 --> 25:18.017
by the wine that I brought.

25:18.050 --> 25:19.552
No.

25:19.586 --> 25:22.021
I've barely had a drink
in ten years.

25:22.054 --> 25:25.157
Well, lucky for you,
over the course

25:25.191 --> 25:28.027
of the many, many boring dates
that I've been on,

25:28.060 --> 25:30.462
I have learned a lot about wine.

25:31.363 --> 25:33.332
Okay, fine.

25:33.365 --> 25:36.068
Okay. Uh, this...

25:36.102 --> 25:39.171
is a bottle
of Brunello di Montalcino.

25:39.205 --> 25:42.875
They call it
the King of Italian wines.

25:42.909 --> 25:45.211
It's a hundred percent
Sangiovese grapes

25:45.244 --> 25:48.848
grown only around
the Tuscan town of Montalcino.

25:48.881 --> 25:51.017
-Montalcino.
-Montalcino.

25:51.050 --> 25:53.019
Very good.
Now, the region is so small

25:53.052 --> 25:57.456
that they can't produce
a top vintage every year.

25:57.489 --> 26:00.960
The ripening season
has to be perfect.

26:00.993 --> 26:03.295
And there's nothing they can do
if the weather...

26:03.329 --> 26:04.931
(sniffs)
won't cooperate.

26:04.964 --> 26:08.134
Maybe this year is too hot.
This year's too cold.

26:08.167 --> 26:09.769
They, uh...

26:11.070 --> 26:13.439
...they have to be patient.

26:15.441 --> 26:18.778
They have to wait out
the bad years...

26:18.811 --> 26:22.114
believing that there is
a better year coming.

26:26.285 --> 26:28.287
And it always is.

26:31.658 --> 26:33.693
(softly):
Thank you.

26:35.862 --> 26:38.397
-Now give me that wine.
-Okay.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.498
(exhales)

26:39.531 --> 26:41.267
(pouring wine)

26:45.304 --> 26:47.273
CASSIDY:
Thanks for the ride.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.942
-Yeah.
-I thought we'd be...

26:49.976 --> 26:52.444
having dinner together
afterwards as a family.

26:53.846 --> 26:56.082
I'm so stupid.

26:56.115 --> 26:59.018
You can't just wish a marriage
into working out.

27:00.219 --> 27:01.520
The truth is,

27:01.553 --> 27:03.522
I don't think
there's much to save.

27:03.555 --> 27:04.824
Forget love.

27:04.857 --> 27:07.293
I don't even think he likes me.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.969
Hey. Come with me.

27:17.003 --> 27:18.037
Mom, I don't want

27:18.070 --> 27:19.471
-to talk about...
-Come on.

27:20.907 --> 27:22.441
-(typing)
-Hey.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.043
-Hmm?
-I need you downstairs.

27:24.076 --> 27:26.278
-Can it wait for just a s...?
-Nope.

27:26.312 --> 27:28.047
(sighs heavily)

27:28.080 --> 27:29.648
(sucks air through teeth)

27:35.187 --> 27:39.491
You two don't like
this thing you have in common.

27:39.525 --> 27:40.960
And I get that.

27:40.993 --> 27:42.361
It's scary.

27:42.394 --> 27:44.030
But it also made three

27:44.063 --> 27:46.699
of my most favorite people
in the world who they are.

27:46.733 --> 27:51.437
William would also get anxious
about things.

27:53.105 --> 27:54.373
He was...

27:54.406 --> 27:57.543
sensitive and artistic
and caring.

27:57.576 --> 28:01.347
But there's a fine line
between caring and worrying,

28:01.380 --> 28:03.549
and sometimes
that line gets blurry.

28:03.582 --> 28:05.785
*

28:07.186 --> 28:09.521
BETH: From the moment
I met your father,

28:09.555 --> 28:12.324
he was obsessed
with making everything okay

28:12.358 --> 28:14.426
for everybody else.

28:14.460 --> 28:16.562
And that took
some getting used to,

28:16.595 --> 28:18.931
but I loved him for it.

28:18.965 --> 28:21.667
'Cause it meant he cared deeply.

28:21.700 --> 28:23.535
Now, there's some things
you get from your dad

28:23.569 --> 28:25.004
that you're gonna have
to navigate around,

28:25.037 --> 28:27.673
but there are some gifts, too.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.776
You give everything your all.

28:29.809 --> 28:31.677
You're an amazing sister

28:31.710 --> 28:36.182
and daughter
and friend and student.

28:36.215 --> 28:38.217
Now, look,
we're gonna get whatever this is

28:38.250 --> 28:40.452
under control, okay?
Believe that.

28:40.486 --> 28:41.754
(Randall sighs)

28:41.788 --> 28:43.856
But I will not
have you talking ill

28:43.890 --> 28:46.425
about three of my most favorite
people in the world.

28:46.458 --> 28:48.527
No way, no how.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.396
*

28:53.299 --> 28:54.834
Are you hearing me?

28:57.336 --> 29:00.773
And if it ever gets to be
too much...

29:03.843 --> 29:06.078
(opens can)

29:11.918 --> 29:13.820
Mm-mm.

29:13.853 --> 29:15.788
Just take a minute...

29:17.156 --> 29:19.258
...and wait for the bubbles
to settle.

29:19.291 --> 29:20.592
(bubbles fizzing)

29:23.863 --> 29:25.998
William.

29:26.032 --> 29:28.600
(fizzing continues)

29:32.972 --> 29:34.841
Um...

29:34.874 --> 29:37.844
last week Ashley wanted to know

29:37.877 --> 29:40.779
if I thought DeShaun was hot.

29:42.114 --> 29:43.782
I should have
just come out then,

29:43.816 --> 29:45.417
like I'd planned to,

29:45.451 --> 29:47.286
but...

29:47.319 --> 29:50.489
instead, I said yes.

29:50.522 --> 29:52.591
(Tess sighs)

29:52.624 --> 29:55.461
And now it's gonna be
a whole thing.

30:01.834 --> 30:03.836
That's a lot.

30:06.672 --> 30:08.707
But we can figure it out.

30:11.243 --> 30:13.312
(softly):
Thanks.

30:13.345 --> 30:15.214
*

30:27.093 --> 30:29.929
*

30:44.510 --> 30:47.846
So, the night your father and I
moved into our house,

30:47.880 --> 30:50.516
I made a fancy dinner, too.

30:50.549 --> 30:52.384
And, of course,
I ended up burning the lasagna.

30:52.418 --> 30:54.653
So we had to open the window

30:54.686 --> 30:57.089
to let all the smoke
out of the kitchen.

30:57.123 --> 30:59.758
And just as we
were sitting down to eat,

30:59.791 --> 31:02.761
a bird flies in
through the window.

31:02.794 --> 31:04.396
REBECCA:
Oh.

31:04.430 --> 31:06.198
-Okay.
-Whoa!

31:06.232 --> 31:07.733
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:07.766 --> 31:09.068
REBECCA:
Now, the important detail

31:09.101 --> 31:12.004
of this story
is that your dad was

31:12.038 --> 31:15.507
-terrified of birds, terrified.
-Terrified. Yeah, he was.

31:15.541 --> 31:16.842
(laughs):
So...

31:16.875 --> 31:18.444
he runs out of the room...

31:18.477 --> 31:20.412
-Hey, Jack?
-and he runs back in

31:20.446 --> 31:22.714
with a tennis racket

31:22.748 --> 31:24.450
and a pillow case,
and he goes...

31:24.483 --> 31:26.252
Don't worry, I'll catch it.

31:26.285 --> 31:30.189
* With a glance and a grin *

31:30.222 --> 31:31.690
-(Rebecca and Jack scream)
-REBECCA: He must have

31:31.723 --> 31:34.093
freaked the bird out,
because then the bird starts...

31:34.126 --> 31:37.529
diving at him
and chasing him around the room.

31:37.563 --> 31:40.599
And your father made the most
ridiculous squealing sound

31:40.632 --> 31:42.234
-I've ever heard.
-(laughter)

31:42.268 --> 31:43.970
(Jack yelping)

31:44.003 --> 31:46.238
So he's trying to get away
from the bird

31:46.272 --> 31:49.875
and protect me, I guess,
with the tennis racket...

31:49.908 --> 31:52.878
-Wait, where did it go?
Where did it go?
-Right there. Look, look, look.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.247
Jack...

31:55.281 --> 31:57.049
(shouting)

31:57.083 --> 32:00.152
And somehow
we knock over the lasagna.

32:00.186 --> 32:04.056
* And growing old too soon... *

32:04.090 --> 32:05.657
Bec?

32:05.691 --> 32:08.327
(exhaling)

32:08.360 --> 32:11.297
(both laugh)

32:11.330 --> 32:13.732
* Like who... *

32:13.765 --> 32:16.435
REBECCA:
And we just started laughing.

32:17.970 --> 32:20.739
And that's when it became
the perfect night.

32:20.772 --> 32:25.011
When we just let it be
what it was.

32:33.285 --> 32:37.489
We need to be able to think
about him and not only be sad.

32:39.525 --> 32:44.163
We need to be able to talk
about the hot sauce.

32:44.196 --> 32:46.832
Right?

32:46.865 --> 32:51.003
He was perfect the way
that dinner was perfect.

32:51.037 --> 32:55.874
He made us... so happy.

32:55.907 --> 32:57.876
And that's all I want
for you guys,

32:57.909 --> 33:00.979
is just for you to be happy.

33:04.683 --> 33:07.186
MIGUEL:
Then, let's have a toast.

33:07.219 --> 33:09.321
-Please.
-To happiness.

33:09.355 --> 33:10.656
-To happiness.
-To happiness.

33:10.689 --> 33:13.392
Oh, and to Kevin and Sophie.

33:13.425 --> 33:14.393
REBECCA:
Yes.

33:14.426 --> 33:15.661
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

33:15.694 --> 33:18.364
To Kevin and Sophie,
cheers to that.

33:18.397 --> 33:19.398
MIGUEL:
Salud.

33:21.433 --> 33:24.036
All right, this meal
was disgusting. I admit it.

33:24.070 --> 33:25.671
-Who's still hungry?
-RANDALL: Me.

33:25.704 --> 33:27.306
-Me.
-Me.

33:27.339 --> 33:30.042
-(mouths)
-Me, too. I am tru...

33:36.182 --> 33:37.749
-(knocking)
-You can keep the change.

33:37.783 --> 33:40.252
Thank you.

33:40.286 --> 33:41.920
Pizza...

33:44.356 --> 33:46.192
-I'll get his, uh, stuff.
-Thank you.

33:46.225 --> 33:47.626
You got it.

33:48.894 --> 33:50.462
-(whispers): Hey.
-CASSIDY: Hey.

33:51.730 --> 33:53.565
(car door closes)

33:53.599 --> 33:55.067
(exhales)

33:55.101 --> 33:56.435
Here you go.

33:56.468 --> 33:58.237
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

33:58.270 --> 34:00.606
You know, your wife was, uh,
she was being honored tonight

34:00.639 --> 34:02.941
for her service
at that hockey game.

34:02.974 --> 34:06.612
Man, she was excited when she
found out you were showing up.

34:06.645 --> 34:09.181
If you were gonna stand there
and stare at your phone all day,

34:09.215 --> 34:12.084
why'd you bother coming?

34:17.589 --> 34:19.091
(whispers):
Okay.

34:19.125 --> 34:21.093
That's good stuff, man.

34:22.128 --> 34:24.763
I met her when I was 15.

34:27.299 --> 34:28.900
I smashed into her
in the hallway

34:28.934 --> 34:32.037
(chuckles): as I was walking
into biology class.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.072
And I knew,

34:34.106 --> 34:39.044
I knew before her books
even hit the floor,

34:39.077 --> 34:41.280
I had just met
my favorite person.

34:44.116 --> 34:49.421
That, uh, that ceremony
that you're talking about

34:49.455 --> 34:55.294
honored the thing that broke
my favorite person in the world.

34:57.596 --> 35:02.134
I was staring at my phone
because otherwise

35:02.168 --> 35:05.804
I would have started openly
weeping in front of my son,

35:05.837 --> 35:08.840
and that's not what he needs
from me right now.

35:10.809 --> 35:13.179
I'm sorry, man.
I-I... I didn't know.

35:13.212 --> 35:16.448
Stay the hell away from my wife.

35:18.284 --> 35:20.252
CASSIDY:
He's out. I'll be back
for him on Thursday.

35:20.286 --> 35:22.288
Yeah.

35:27.025 --> 35:29.161
-(door closes)
-(laughs softly)

35:29.195 --> 35:30.462
What?

35:30.496 --> 35:32.097
(exhales)

35:32.130 --> 35:34.132
He still likes you.

35:47.313 --> 35:48.514
(knocking on door)

35:53.084 --> 35:56.188
It's all right. I'm sober.

35:57.423 --> 36:00.158
(whispers):
Okay.

36:03.729 --> 36:05.864
I'm not a storyteller.

36:05.897 --> 36:08.467
And I don't like people.

36:08.500 --> 36:11.503
I-I don't even like you
very much, and, uh,

36:11.537 --> 36:14.840
you're the closest person I've
been to in the last 20 years.

36:21.880 --> 36:25.317
You know, your father
wasn't the, uh,

36:25.351 --> 36:27.719
first person to do this.

36:29.087 --> 36:31.390
Uh, he learned that trick
from his father,

36:31.423 --> 36:33.892
uh, your grandfather.

36:33.925 --> 36:35.894
That man was a bastard,

36:35.927 --> 36:39.765
but every now and then...

36:39.798 --> 36:41.633
he could be kind of fun.

36:45.371 --> 36:48.106
Yeah. What he'd do was...

36:50.141 --> 36:53.945
...he would fold down
the sides of the carton--

36:53.979 --> 36:59.385
hmm-- so that it looked
like a, like a big cake.

36:59.418 --> 37:01.787
And then he'd then get a knife

37:01.820 --> 37:06.892
and just wave it
over the ice cream.

37:06.925 --> 37:10.028
And he'd, he'd ask, uh,

37:10.061 --> 37:13.965
"How-how good a boy
were you today?

37:13.999 --> 37:16.635
"Were you kind of good?

37:16.668 --> 37:19.505
Or were you real good?"

37:20.739 --> 37:22.107
And depending on the answer,

37:22.140 --> 37:24.343
that was how big
a slice you got.

37:38.123 --> 37:40.292
So...

37:40.326 --> 37:43.194
How good were you today, Kevin?

37:46.665 --> 37:49.568
Um...

37:49.601 --> 37:53.972
I think I annoyed
my uncle today.

37:54.005 --> 37:57.843
Other than that, I think
I was pretty good. (chuckles)

37:57.876 --> 38:00.512
Well, then, you get

38:00.546 --> 38:04.383
a pretty good slice
of ice cream.

38:17.696 --> 38:19.965
I've been very good.

38:19.998 --> 38:22.000
*

38:25.704 --> 38:28.039
(laughter)

38:28.073 --> 38:31.343
-Uh, I need to give you
your wedding gift.
-(Sophie gasps)

38:31.377 --> 38:33.211
-I hope it's an air popper.
-Oh. I-I hope it's cash.

38:33.244 --> 38:34.780
-Kevin.
-REBECCA: Excuse me.

38:34.813 --> 38:35.981
MIGUEL:
Oh.

38:36.014 --> 38:39.551
No, it is a song.

38:39.585 --> 38:41.553
For the newlyweds.

38:41.587 --> 38:43.989
From a little movie
called The Princess Bride.

38:44.022 --> 38:46.825
-MIGUEL: Ooh.
-Mm-hmm.

38:46.858 --> 38:49.194
(piano playing)

38:53.432 --> 38:58.236
* Come, my love,
I'll tell you a tale *

38:58.269 --> 39:00.138
* Of a boy and girl *

39:00.171 --> 39:03.375
* And their love story *

39:03.409 --> 39:06.011
* And how he loved her *

39:06.044 --> 39:09.581
* Oh, so much *

39:09.615 --> 39:15.086
* And all the charms
she did possess *

39:15.120 --> 39:17.856
* Now, this did happen... *

39:17.889 --> 39:20.358
-Just-- careful.
-Is that our old piano?

39:20.392 --> 39:22.761
* Things were not
so complex... *

39:22.794 --> 39:24.996
(laughs softly)

39:25.030 --> 39:28.834
The Pearson men nail
another grand gesture.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.235
* She walked *

39:30.268 --> 39:32.003
* When he looked in her eyes *

39:32.037 --> 39:35.674
* He became obsessed *

39:35.707 --> 39:38.510
* My love is like
a storybook story... *

39:38.544 --> 39:40.111
That's middle C.

39:40.145 --> 39:42.113
Yeah, that's your home base.

39:42.147 --> 39:44.683
You know where that is,
you can go anywhere.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.685
Yeah.

39:46.718 --> 39:49.120
* My love is like *

39:49.154 --> 39:52.458
* A storybook story *

39:52.491 --> 39:56.595
* It's as real
as the feelings I feel *

39:56.628 --> 40:00.866
* It's as real as the feelings *

40:00.899 --> 40:02.968
* I feel... *

40:03.001 --> 40:05.804
-I found a therapist for Tess.
-Good.

40:05.837 --> 40:08.239
I think that'll be
really helpful for her.

40:08.273 --> 40:12.010
And... I found one for you, too.

40:13.278 --> 40:15.113
I don't need a therapist.

40:15.146 --> 40:17.115
I'm good.
Best I've been in years.

40:17.148 --> 40:19.117
But you've been
working crazy hours

40:19.150 --> 40:23.622
and running ten miles a day and
constantly bouncing that knee.

40:23.655 --> 40:25.457
-(exhales)
-You know,
you don't have to wait

40:25.491 --> 40:27.726
for it all to come crashing down
to get help.

40:27.759 --> 40:30.929
Glad to know you think
I'm gonna crash.

40:30.962 --> 40:32.764
You know, when you had
your first breakdown,

40:32.798 --> 40:35.601
you thought that was
gonna be the only one.

40:35.634 --> 40:39.671
All these years of just managing
it and making lists, babe...

40:39.705 --> 40:42.140
We have resources now
and people who are trained

40:42.173 --> 40:44.676
to deal with this kind of stuff.

40:47.178 --> 40:49.080
I appreciate your concern.

40:49.114 --> 40:51.517
-But I'm fine.
-Okay, I am worried

40:51.550 --> 40:53.852
that we are just one big
emotional thing from this...

40:53.885 --> 40:56.154
Beth, I'm fine.

40:56.187 --> 41:00.992
* My love is like
a storybook story *

41:01.026 --> 41:05.697
* But it's as real
as the feelings I feel *

41:05.731 --> 41:11.036
* My love is like
a storybook story *

41:11.069 --> 41:16.775
* It's as real
as the feelings I feel *

41:16.808 --> 41:19.144
* It's as real
as the feelings I feel... *

41:19.177 --> 41:21.012
(chuckles)

41:31.657 --> 41:33.625
(footsteps approaching)

41:33.659 --> 41:36.461
REBECCA:
What's wrong, Bug?

41:36.494 --> 41:38.496
What?

41:50.341 --> 41:52.210
I was trying so hard
to hold it together

41:52.243 --> 41:54.746
that year
after your father died.

41:57.583 --> 42:01.987
And I wanted to believe so badly
that you kids were happy.

42:02.020 --> 42:06.357
I'm so sorry I didn't see
what was happening.

42:06.391 --> 42:08.359
I didn't see it, either.

42:55.073 --> 42:57.575
