16:23.149 --> 16:25.151
Speak for yourself.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.907
Okay, what's your favorite book?

16:30.949 --> 16:31.950
"Charlotte's Web".

16:31.991 --> 16:34.076
"How to pick up boys."

16:35.328 --> 16:37.497
There you go.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.497
You both read a book.

16:37.538 --> 16:39.290
Actually, I never read it.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.959
It's a book on tape.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.005
Moving right along.

16:46.046 --> 16:47.047
What's your favorite food?

16:47.089 --> 16:48.299
Pizza.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.217
There you go, Kimmy.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.217
You love pizza.

16:50.259 --> 16:52.804
Not as much as I love trout.

16:54.472 --> 16:56.516
Deej, this is so stupid.

16:56.557 --> 16:58.100
It sure is.

16:58.142 --> 17:01.103
There you go.

16:58.142 --> 17:01.103
You guys both agree it's stupid.

17:01.145 --> 17:03.314
Move your chairs closer.

17:03.356 --> 17:06.150
Now, come on,

17:03.356 --> 17:06.150
let's keep going.

17:06.192 --> 17:07.652
I don't want to keep going.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.112
You're always telling

17:07.694 --> 17:10.112
me what to do.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.031
Yeah. She's so bossy.

17:12.072 --> 17:13.199
I'm sick of it.

17:13.240 --> 17:14.951
We agree again.

17:16.202 --> 17:18.746
And DJ's always late.

17:18.788 --> 17:21.165
Oh, I know.

17:18.788 --> 17:21.165
The hairspray queen.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.376
She has to look

17:21.207 --> 17:23.376
perfect at all times.

17:23.417 --> 17:24.711
I know what you mean.

17:24.752 --> 17:27.421
Do you know she's never

17:24.752 --> 17:27.421
complimented my hair?

17:27.463 --> 17:28.673
Me, neither.

17:29.674 --> 17:31.133
I think you've got the idea.

17:31.175 --> 17:33.093
I've tried to tell

17:31.175 --> 17:33.093
her to chill out

17:33.135 --> 17:35.638
but when she's on one of

17:33.135 --> 17:35.638
her power trips, forget it.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.640
And did you ever

17:35.680 --> 17:37.640
watch TV with her?

17:37.682 --> 17:41.019
I know, she never

17:37.682 --> 17:41.019
lets go of the remote.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.230
Now that we're all friends,

17:41.060 --> 17:44.230
why don't we change the subject?

17:44.271 --> 17:46.273
Oh, and sharing

17:44.271 --> 17:46.273
a bathroom with her.

17:46.315 --> 17:50.778
Hey, you might as well just

17:46.315 --> 17:50.778
go down to the Texaco station.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.740
I could go on for hours.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.950
- Do you like frozen yogurt?

17:53.781 --> 17:55.950
- Love it.

17:55.992 --> 17:57.159
- Strawberry?

17:55.992 --> 17:57.159
- My favorite.

17:57.201 --> 17:58.327
- Let's go.

17:57.201 --> 17:58.327
- Yeah.

17:58.369 --> 17:59.746
Girls, wait.

17:59.787 --> 18:01.330
I like frozen yogurt too.

18:03.499 --> 18:05.710
Pick a card. Any card.

18:08.046 --> 18:09.505
Aw, man!

18:09.547 --> 18:12.592
I got the old maid again.

18:14.134 --> 18:15.929
Don't play this for money.

18:19.015 --> 18:21.851
Teddy, where am I

18:19.015 --> 18:21.851
going to sleep tonight?

18:23.061 --> 18:24.645
We're out of beds.

18:24.687 --> 18:27.732
You can sleep in

18:24.687 --> 18:27.732
the kitchen with Sparky.

18:28.983 --> 18:31.151
I used to have a dog.

18:31.193 --> 18:33.153
Those were the days.

18:33.905 --> 18:35.114
[doorbell rings]

18:35.155 --> 18:38.242
Michelle, I think

18:35.155 --> 18:38.242
that's your family.

18:38.284 --> 18:41.996
I bet they're coming

18:38.284 --> 18:41.996
to say they're sorry.

18:44.331 --> 18:45.416
Hi, Danny, hi, Jess.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.126
Hi! Where's my little girl?

18:47.167 --> 18:48.836
Oh, she's right here

18:47.167 --> 18:48.836
in the living room.

18:48.878 --> 18:50.630
Alright, Danny, be strong.

18:50.671 --> 18:51.798
Remember the plan.

18:53.299 --> 18:56.510
Hello, boys. Do you have

18:53.299 --> 18:56.510
something to say to me?

18:57.887 --> 18:59.097
Yes, Michelle, we, uh..

18:59.138 --> 19:01.515
we feel very bad

18:59.138 --> 19:01.515
that you left home.

19:01.557 --> 19:03.726
I knew it. Keep going.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.854
Well, uh..

19:06.896 --> 19:08.731
...we miss you

19:06.896 --> 19:08.731
very much, munchkin.

19:08.773 --> 19:11.567
And you'll never be

19:08.773 --> 19:11.567
Uncle Tattletale again?

19:11.609 --> 19:12.652
Well, I don't know how I can.

19:12.693 --> 19:14.070
You don't live with us anymore.

19:14.112 --> 19:15.529
I don't?

19:15.571 --> 19:16.656
No, remember, uh..

19:16.697 --> 19:17.824
you said you

19:16.697 --> 19:17.824
didn't like our rules?

19:17.865 --> 19:19.408
So, you wanna live here.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.408
That's cool.

19:19.450 --> 19:21.285
We brought you extra clothes,

19:19.450 --> 19:21.285
your toothbrush

19:21.327 --> 19:23.329
and everything you need,

19:21.327 --> 19:23.329
right here in this suitcase.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.539
What is this, a joke?

19:25.581 --> 19:27.207
Oh, no, no.

19:25.581 --> 19:27.207
It's not a joke, Michelle.

19:27.249 --> 19:30.128
There's nothing funny

19:27.249 --> 19:30.128
about running away from home.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.130
- Bye-bye.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.130
- See you, kid.

19:32.171 --> 19:34.632
If you need us, you know

19:32.171 --> 19:34.632
the number, just give us a buzz.

19:34.674 --> 19:35.758
Bye, sweetheart.

19:37.384 --> 19:39.762
Wait, you forgot something.

19:39.804 --> 19:41.221
What? What did we forget?

19:41.263 --> 19:43.432
Me.

19:43.474 --> 19:44.809
Really?

19:44.851 --> 19:46.393
You mean, you wanna come

19:44.851 --> 19:46.393
back and live with us?

19:46.435 --> 19:48.104
Even with Uncle Tattletale?

19:48.146 --> 19:50.314
Yes. I want to go home.

19:51.691 --> 19:53.151
Oh!

19:53.192 --> 19:55.235
Yeah!

19:55.277 --> 19:56.529
And we want you to come home.

19:56.570 --> 19:58.031
Yeah. We missed you.

19:59.365 --> 20:03.077
Michelle, don't you

19:59.365 --> 20:03.077
ever do this again.

20:03.119 --> 20:04.328
You had us worried sick.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.955
Yeah, that wasn't

20:04.370 --> 20:05.955
very smart, young lady.

20:05.997 --> 20:08.916
You're telling me? I was

20:05.997 --> 20:08.916
going to sleep with the dog.

20:10.877 --> 20:13.379
You'll sleep

20:10.877 --> 20:13.379
in your own bed.

20:13.420 --> 20:16.132
My room! My bed!

20:16.174 --> 20:17.591
My pig!

20:17.633 --> 20:19.093
I love this place.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.555
Alright. Come on, Michelle.

20:22.596 --> 20:24.598
It's time for one

20:22.596 --> 20:24.598
of our little talks.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.895
Now, what you did

20:26.392 --> 20:28.895
today was very wrong.

20:28.936 --> 20:32.940
I know. I should

20:28.936 --> 20:32.940
never touch your stuff.

20:32.982 --> 20:35.568
Well, that's right, but I'm

20:32.982 --> 20:35.568
talking about running away.

20:35.609 --> 20:37.486
That was very dangerous.

20:37.528 --> 20:39.947
Now, you're never to leave this

20:37.528 --> 20:39.947
house without our permission.

20:39.989 --> 20:41.407
If you have a problem,

20:39.989 --> 20:41.407
you come talk to me

20:41.448 --> 20:43.201
or someone else

20:41.448 --> 20:43.201
in this house. Kapish?

20:43.242 --> 20:45.578
- Cupsheesh.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.578
- Alright.

20:45.619 --> 20:47.663
Now, level with me.

20:47.705 --> 20:49.123
Why did you really run away?

20:49.165 --> 20:52.459
I was mad at you because

20:49.165 --> 20:52.459
you got me in trouble.

20:52.501 --> 20:54.670
Well, I felt terrible

20:52.501 --> 20:54.670
about gettin' you in trouble

20:54.712 --> 20:57.090
but I couldn't let you get away

20:54.712 --> 20:57.090
with the breaking rules.

20:57.131 --> 20:58.841
Because if you did it today,

20:57.131 --> 20:58.841
you'd do it all the time.

20:58.883 --> 21:00.134
And that's not cool.

21:00.176 --> 21:02.595
Am I still your little munchkin?

21:02.636 --> 21:03.971
I'll tell you what.

21:04.013 --> 21:05.389
You can still be

21:04.013 --> 21:05.389
my little munchkin

21:05.431 --> 21:07.767
if you stop calling

21:05.431 --> 21:07.767
me Uncle Tattletale.

21:07.808 --> 21:10.728
Okay, Uncle Jesse.

21:10.770 --> 21:12.855
Alright. You're never

21:10.770 --> 21:12.855
gonna run away again?

21:12.897 --> 21:15.233
Never, ever, ever, ever.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.193
Alright.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.193
Let's shake on it. Ready?

21:18.694 --> 21:20.529
[laughing]

21:22.406 --> 21:25.159
- I love you, munchkin.

21:22.406 --> 21:25.159
- I know.

21:25.201 --> 21:26.244
[laughing]

21:26.285 --> 21:28.370
I love you, Uncle Jesse.

21:29.247 --> 21:30.623
I know.

21:36.378 --> 21:38.047
I'll see you

21:36.378 --> 21:38.047
at dinner, kid.

21:38.089 --> 21:41.926
Uncle Jesse, were you really

21:38.089 --> 21:41.926
going to leave me at Teddy's?

21:41.968 --> 21:43.510
What do you think?

21:45.054 --> 21:47.723
That was very sneaky.

21:47.765 --> 21:49.308
Ha ha ha.

21:50.977 --> 21:53.562
I got another good idea.

21:55.231 --> 21:56.983
I don't wanna hear it.

21:57.024 --> 22:01.112
Let's sneak out

21:57.024 --> 22:01.112
and watch show "MTV Raps."

22:01.154 --> 22:03.239
I want you out of here.

22:03.281 --> 22:05.283
[blowing raspberry]

22:06.242 --> 22:09.078
I like the way she dresses.

22:09.120 --> 22:12.539
- Michelle, I'm so proud of you.

22:09.120 --> 22:12.539
- Thank you.

22:12.581 --> 22:16.085
And remember,

22:12.581 --> 22:16.085
always do the right thing.

22:16.127 --> 22:17.753
Oh, I will.

22:19.546 --> 22:22.008
She can get on my nerves.

22:30.183 --> 22:31.809
[theme music]

22:37.439 --> 22:39.566
[theme music]
