00:01.710 --> 00:08.342
<i>It seems today that all you see</i>
<i>Is violence in movies and sex on TV</i>

00:08.425 --> 00:11.887
<i>But where are those</i>
<i>Good old-fashioned values</i>

00:11.970 --> 00:14.389
<i>On which we used to rely?</i>

00:15.098 --> 00:18.310
<i>Lucky there's a family guy</i>

00:18.393 --> 00:21.563
<i>Lucky there's a man who positively can do</i>

00:21.647 --> 00:23.148
<i>All the things that make us</i>

00:23.232 --> 00:24.983
<i>Laugh and cry!</i>

00:25.067 --> 00:30.113
<i>He's a family guy!</i>

00:37.162 --> 00:38.705
- Hey.
- What are you working on?

00:38.789 --> 00:42.209
Oh, just trying to make some sense
of these numbers.

00:44.086 --> 00:47.172
What the... What did you hit?
What happened to my spreadsheet?

00:47.256 --> 00:50.092
What exactly was the endgame
if I hadn't walked in?

00:50.175 --> 00:52.553
Ugh, there's nothing worse
than grocery shopping

00:52.636 --> 00:54.221
on the day before Thanksgiving.

00:55.430 --> 00:58.016
Yeah, that's the sound
a rich family's turkey makes.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.477
There's still a lot more groceries
in the car.

01:00.561 --> 01:02.521
Well, it's not a race. Take a break.

01:02.604 --> 01:06.859
Ugh, if you knew how close we were
to putting you down last year.

01:06.942 --> 01:08.318
Geez, what's her problem?

01:08.402 --> 01:09.945
Eh, Thanksgiving's exhausting.

01:10.028 --> 01:13.365
You know what she could use?
A little sip of that drink I invented.

01:13.448 --> 01:15.784
Hi! Stewie Griffin here,

01:15.868 --> 01:18.078
Monster Energy Drink.
What is it? I don't know,

01:18.161 --> 01:20.330
but it's free from this truck
that stopped outside your work.

01:20.414 --> 01:22.749
Mix it with booze.
Ever been wide-awake-blacked-out?

01:22.833 --> 01:24.501
Ever try to jump over a train on a bike?

01:24.585 --> 01:26.795
Ever bit the beak off a bird?

01:26.879 --> 01:28.755
Put it in your body
and ask questions later.

01:28.839 --> 01:30.424
It's green, so it's nature.

01:33.802 --> 01:35.888
<i>We now return</i>
<i>to</i> Guy Friends.

01:35.971 --> 01:39.183
<i>- So, you must be pretty pumped.</i>
<i>- For what?</i>

01:39.266 --> 01:42.895
<i>- Oh. Olympics.</i>
<i>- Oh, yeah. I guess that's starting soon.</i>

01:42.978 --> 01:44.897
<i>I thought you were a big Olympics guy.</i>

01:44.980 --> 01:46.773
<i>Yeah, I like 'em okay.</i>

01:46.857 --> 01:48.233
<i>Huh.</i>

01:48.317 --> 01:49.860
<i>Guy friends</i>

01:49.943 --> 01:52.571
<i>A computer made us roommates in college</i>

01:52.654 --> 01:53.864
<i>That's why we're friends</i>

01:53.947 --> 01:55.282
<i>Guy friends!</i>

01:55.365 --> 01:57.159
Mail's here.

01:57.242 --> 02:00.662
Any fliers of Hispanic women
running for city council?

02:00.746 --> 02:02.164
Yeah, there is.

02:02.247 --> 02:03.498
Thank you.

02:04.374 --> 02:06.752
Peter, you got a letter
from your sister Karen.

02:06.835 --> 02:10.047
What? You've got a sister, Dad?
How come we've never met her?

02:10.130 --> 02:13.884
Is she a prim and proper aunt
or a big, fat, dirty aunt?

02:13.967 --> 02:16.386
I have no obligation
to tell any of you anything.

02:16.470 --> 02:19.264
Mr. Griffin has shown good faith
in appearing here today

02:19.348 --> 02:22.226
and will not be subjected
to this sort of hostile interrogation.

02:22.309 --> 02:25.312
Your father doesn't like to talk
about his sister, Meg.

02:25.395 --> 02:27.064
They've never really gotten along.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.815
Wow, Peter.
In all the years I've known you,

02:28.899 --> 02:30.526
you've never even mentioned a sister.

02:30.609 --> 02:32.361
Big deal, I don't talk about my sister.

02:32.444 --> 02:34.530
I also don't talk about
that tickling uncle.

02:34.613 --> 02:36.949
no tickling.

02:37.032 --> 02:38.575
You got it.

02:41.119 --> 02:42.788
You didn't say anything about Uncle Neil.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.540
Whose uncles are you?

02:44.623 --> 02:47.626
It says here your sister's
coming for Thanksgiving.

02:47.709 --> 02:48.710
She what?

02:48.794 --> 02:50.045
If we're having guests,

02:50.128 --> 02:53.090
can I invite Rosario Vargas
from the third district,

02:53.173 --> 02:54.800
a leader you can depend on?

02:54.883 --> 02:56.218
I don't want Karen here.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.804
Peter, you've been avoiding
your sister for too long.

02:58.887 --> 03:01.139
Besides, she says she's been
having Thanksgiving

03:01.223 --> 03:03.016
with your mother for the last 20 years.

03:03.100 --> 03:06.603
And now that your mom has passed,
she'd like to spend Thanksgiving with you.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.526
No.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.070
Peter, Karen's coming and that's that.

03:15.153 --> 03:17.281
How cool! I didn't even know
I had an aunt.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.615
I can't wait to meet her.

03:18.699 --> 03:20.993
Look, I'm telling you guys,
it's gonna be a disaster.

03:21.076 --> 03:23.537
Just like the alternate ending
of <i>Back to the Future.</i>

03:28.625 --> 03:32.421
Well, if I'm gonna disappear into nothing,
I might as well bang my mom.

03:32.504 --> 03:34.047
Hey, Lorraine, wait up!

03:36.466 --> 03:40.637
Hi! My name's Marty! I'm in a picture!

03:42.931 --> 03:44.892
<i>To be contondered!</i>

03:50.105 --> 03:52.399
<i>We now return</i>
<i>to</i> The Cosby Show,

03:52.482 --> 03:54.109
<i>knowing what we know now.</i>

04:20.594 --> 04:25.349
Huh. I was so busy not seeing color,
I didn't see the raping, either.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.684
Okay, everyone. It'll be another hour

04:27.768 --> 04:31.063
before the turkey's done,
but I made more appetizers.

04:31.146 --> 04:34.358
Ooh, grape jelly on a Triscuit.
You're a whiz.

04:34.441 --> 04:36.777
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow down.
Save your appetite.

04:36.860 --> 04:39.112
And don't think I haven't noticed
you've already had two drinks.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.281
You're, like,
all the worst parts of a girlfriend.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.243
Oh. That must be Karen.

04:44.326 --> 04:46.328
I'll get it. Aunt Karen?

04:46.411 --> 04:48.455
And you must be Meg.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.333
Do that to me!

04:55.754 --> 04:58.632
Wow, it's so cool that I've got an aunt
I didn't know about.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.510
Oh, Karen, I'm so happy you could make it.

05:01.593 --> 05:04.721
Lois Pewterschmidt. The one that got away.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.850
I'm just joshing, kid.
Auntie's not a biscuit-bumper.

05:09.852 --> 05:11.645
I'm not, either!

05:12.855 --> 05:14.857
Peter, come say hello to your sister.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.567
Fine.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.319
Hey, Karen. Welcome to our...

05:19.403 --> 05:21.196
Bring it in, Pee Pee!

05:24.491 --> 05:25.909
I like her.

05:25.993 --> 05:29.454
Hello. I am City Councilwoman
Rosario Vargas.

05:29.538 --> 05:33.417
Quahog doesn't work
if it doesn't work for all of us.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.420
That's a beautiful pantsuit, Miss Vargas.

05:42.593 --> 05:45.012
Wow, Karen, nice to meet you.
I'm Glenn Quagmire.

05:45.095 --> 05:46.805
I didn't know Peter even had a sister.

05:46.889 --> 05:48.932
What are you, ashamed of me, Chin Nuts?

05:49.016 --> 05:52.102
Oh, my God.
His chin kind of does look like nuts.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.229
Ha, ha! I never noticed that.

05:54.313 --> 05:55.731
How could you not notice it?

05:55.814 --> 05:59.568
Watch this, I-I'll punch him in the nuts.

05:59.651 --> 06:00.736
Eh, sort of clever.

06:00.819 --> 06:03.780
Wait a second. I know you.
You're that lady wrestler.

06:03.864 --> 06:06.366
Yeah, yeah, yeah, he's right.
Hey, w-what do they call you again?

06:06.450 --> 06:08.577
Heavy Flo. You're Heavy Flo!

06:08.660 --> 06:10.412
In the flesh and blood.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.539
- Gross.
- Man, you're amazing.

06:12.623 --> 06:15.000
I remember when you called out
Andrea the Giant

06:15.083 --> 06:16.502
the day after September 11.

06:16.585 --> 06:18.795
What just happened was a national tragedy,

06:18.879 --> 06:21.215
but it's nothing compared
to what I'm gonna do

06:21.298 --> 06:23.050
to Andrea the Giant!

06:23.133 --> 06:25.344
We will never forget
what happened yesterday,

06:25.427 --> 06:28.805
but you'll also never forget
what's gonna happen September 17

06:28.889 --> 06:31.767
at the Jack Witschi Sports Arena!

06:31.850 --> 06:34.269
Peter, I can't believe
you've kept your sister a secret.

06:34.353 --> 06:35.521
She's amazing!

06:35.604 --> 06:38.649
Yeah, she's crazy strong.
Like Superman on a date.

06:38.732 --> 06:41.026
Yeah, I wasn't here,
but I heard her scream,

06:41.109 --> 06:43.278
so I came flying in
and found her like this.

06:43.362 --> 06:44.947
It's weird. Same cause of death

06:45.030 --> 06:47.658
as those three guys
in that local public bathroom.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.326
Unsolvable.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.874
Now do you see why
I didn't want Karen here, Lois?

06:55.958 --> 06:57.835
She terrorized me my whole childhood.

06:57.918 --> 07:00.254
Now she's got to embarrass me
in front of my friends?

07:00.337 --> 07:02.506
Peter, Bonnie just changed Joe
on the table.

07:02.589 --> 07:03.715
What are you worried about?

07:03.799 --> 07:05.884
Still, I don't want to go back out there.

07:05.968 --> 07:09.096
Look, I know you've had your differences,
but Karen's your sister.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.472
And you're grown-ups now.

07:10.556 --> 07:13.684
Can't you just go out there
and pretend to have a good time?

07:13.767 --> 07:16.812
Fine, I'll play along.
I guess I've lied before.

07:19.648 --> 07:21.483
- Where you going?
- Home.

07:21.567 --> 07:23.110
Where's home?

07:23.193 --> 07:24.611
The White House.

07:28.490 --> 07:31.994
Okay, I'm here. This is my house.
You can go now. Thanks for taking me home.

07:32.077 --> 07:34.830
- Go ahead, go inside.
- I will. You can drive away now.

07:34.913 --> 07:37.416
No, no, I-I want to make sure
you get inside safe.

07:37.499 --> 07:39.334
Yeah, but I-I got to look through
the mail first.

07:39.418 --> 07:42.504
You know how it is. Really, I insist.
I-It's totally okay. Go.

07:42.588 --> 07:44.673
At this point,
it's more about me than it is you.

07:44.756 --> 07:46.049
It's a bad neighborhood.

07:46.133 --> 07:49.678
If I don't see you go inside,
I'll be thinking about it all night.

08:07.196 --> 08:09.281
Come on in, Mr. President!

08:22.252 --> 08:25.088
And then, so I'm like,
"Peter, how was I supposed to know

08:25.172 --> 08:27.925
"you didn't want your teammates
to know you wore a bra?"

08:29.635 --> 08:32.095
It was a custom-designed
sports halter top.

08:32.179 --> 08:33.722
More stories! More stories!

08:33.805 --> 08:37.726
Hey, tell one where Peter is a nincompoop
or maybe a silly Billy.

08:37.809 --> 08:40.395
Oh, man.

08:40.479 --> 08:42.064
Okay, let's just carve the turkey.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.815
Oh, Aunt Karen already carved it.

08:43.899 --> 08:45.526
She did? But that's my thing.

08:45.609 --> 08:48.529
I always do my "are you a leg man
or a breast man" joke.

08:48.612 --> 08:51.073
Aunt Karen did that, too.
It was hilarious.

08:51.156 --> 08:53.408
I never really got it until she said it.

08:53.492 --> 08:54.826
Ha, ha!

08:56.787 --> 08:59.581
Hey, Karen, later you got to show us
some of your wrestling holds.

08:59.665 --> 09:02.042
Yeah, what's that trademark
finishing move of yours?

09:02.125 --> 09:03.168
The Toxic Shock.

09:03.252 --> 09:06.922
Oh, yeah, that move is badass!
You're awesome. Know what else is awesome?

09:07.005 --> 09:08.674
- This stuffing.
- Thank you, Glenn.

09:08.757 --> 09:10.509
You're welcome. I'm in a good mood.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.636
Sure, what the hell,
I'll show you my moves.

09:12.719 --> 09:13.762
Maybe after dinner.

09:13.846 --> 09:16.557
No, no, no.
The family football game is after dinner.

09:16.640 --> 09:17.641
We do it every year!

09:17.724 --> 09:19.768
Peter, calm down. You're making a scene.

09:19.852 --> 09:22.563
It's not my fault, Lois.
She's ruining Thanksgiving!

09:22.646 --> 09:25.232
The way Tim Burton
ruined the Fourth of July!

09:29.695 --> 09:33.365
<i>Spooky! Happy!</i>
<i>Spooky! Happy!</i>

09:33.448 --> 09:34.950
<i>Weirdness! Weirdness!</i>

09:35.033 --> 09:36.785
<i>Spooky! Happy!</i>

09:36.869 --> 09:38.495
<i>La, la, la!</i>

09:38.579 --> 09:40.163
<i>Weirdness, weirdness</i>

09:40.247 --> 09:41.915
<i>Patriotic weirdness</i>

09:41.999 --> 09:43.625
<i>Barbecuing human heads</i>

09:43.709 --> 09:45.252
<i>Every president is dead</i>

09:45.335 --> 09:47.045
<i>Everybody's gonna die</i>

09:47.129 --> 09:48.839
<i>Have a dark and dead July!</i>

09:50.966 --> 09:54.887
Fat chicks with black hair
get tattoos of me!

10:03.812 --> 10:05.397
God, I love this time of year.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.774
It's just past
all the amazing colors of fall,

10:07.858 --> 10:09.610
and before the white of winter.

10:09.693 --> 10:11.820
Just brown and gray.

10:11.904 --> 10:12.988
Magical.

10:13.071 --> 10:14.573
All right, let's do this.

10:14.656 --> 10:16.116
All right, listen up, I'm the captain.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.202
The teams are chosen
by a lottery system where you...

10:18.285 --> 10:19.870
Aunt Karen, can I be on your team?

10:19.953 --> 10:20.996
Yeah, yeah, me, too!

10:21.079 --> 10:26.043
Uh, yeah, sure, I'll take, uh, Meg,
Skinny, Hot Chocolate and The Bus.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.587
Pee Pee, you get the crumbs. Let's go.

10:28.670 --> 10:32.382
All right, let's do it, Pop!
I'm gonna make some sports points for you!

10:32.466 --> 10:33.634
We'll kick off.

10:36.512 --> 10:38.764
Hey, time-out! Did anyone tape the parade?

10:38.847 --> 10:40.891
Please tell me someone taped the parade!

10:46.438 --> 10:48.982
Oh, my God! She's doing The Toxic Shock!

10:58.075 --> 11:03.205
Y-Y-You're a j-jerk, K-K-Karen!

11:03.288 --> 11:04.540
What the hell was that?

11:04.623 --> 11:05.999
That's his stutter.

11:06.083 --> 11:08.544
And whenever he stutters,
he usually pees his pants.

11:08.627 --> 11:11.797
N-No, I d-d-don't.

11:13.632 --> 11:15.300
Oh.

11:17.719 --> 11:20.222
So this is football. I like it.

11:26.979 --> 11:29.273
Hi, Dad. Look, I-I just want you to know,

11:29.356 --> 11:32.776
I feel bad about what happened
with you and Aunt Karen the other day.

11:32.860 --> 11:35.737
Oh, you mean when she put me in
that no-bottom James Bond chair

11:35.821 --> 11:37.072
and assaulted my grundle?

11:37.155 --> 11:38.574
I didn't even know about that.

11:38.657 --> 11:40.534
Well, that's 'cause it didn't happen.

11:40.617 --> 11:43.245
I'd kick her ass
if she tried something like that!

11:43.328 --> 11:46.373
Dad, stop. Even I can see
that your sister's a huge bully.

11:46.456 --> 11:49.459
And trust me, I know more
about getting bullied than anyone.

11:49.543 --> 11:51.587
You do? How?

11:51.670 --> 11:55.465
<i>Celebrate good times, come on</i>

11:55.549 --> 11:57.467
<i>Let's celebrate</i>

11:57.551 --> 11:59.136
<i>Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh</i>

11:59.219 --> 12:03.515
<i>Celebrate good times, come on.</i>

12:05.642 --> 12:07.102
Man, I love that song.

12:07.186 --> 12:09.188
Dad, what I'm trying to tell you is,

12:09.271 --> 12:11.940
I now see why you've been
so tough on me all these years.

12:12.024 --> 12:13.192
'Cause it makes my friends laugh?

12:13.275 --> 12:16.695
No, because that's how Aunt Karen
treated you when you were a kid.

12:18.197 --> 12:20.991
That's right. And that's why
you need to confront Karen.

12:21.074 --> 12:24.578
Oh, no. Oh, no. No, I can't do that.
I tried for years to stand up to her.

12:24.661 --> 12:25.662
Nothing ever worked.

12:25.746 --> 12:28.207
What, so now you're gonna quit?
You can't quit.

12:28.290 --> 12:30.209
What if Muhammad Ali had quit?

12:30.292 --> 12:32.211
Ah, my grandchildren!

12:32.294 --> 12:34.296
Who would like me to read them a book,

12:34.379 --> 12:36.590
or maybe paint their name
on a grain of rice?

12:36.673 --> 12:38.383
Honey, dinnertime!

12:38.467 --> 12:39.760
Ah, my favorite.

12:39.843 --> 12:41.428
Hot soup.

12:41.512 --> 12:43.096
Right in there.

12:43.180 --> 12:45.557
Dad, I know
you can stand up to Aunt Karen.

12:45.641 --> 12:48.810
And maybe, if you finally do,
she'll stop terrorizing you,

12:48.894 --> 12:52.147
and you won't have to take it out on me
for the rest of my life.

12:52.231 --> 12:53.774
You know what, Meg?

12:53.857 --> 12:55.859
You're right! I'm gonna do it!

12:55.943 --> 12:57.694
- You are?
- Damn right!

12:57.778 --> 12:58.862
Yay, Dad!

12:58.946 --> 13:03.325
I am gonna become a lady wrestler
and defeat Heavy Flo in the ring.

13:03.408 --> 13:05.827
Wait. What? No! What?
I meant go talk to her.

13:05.911 --> 13:08.205
Nope, it's got to be
a lady wrestling match.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.831
Hey, Meg, Thanksgiving's over.

13:09.915 --> 13:12.876
Come help me
with the Christmas decorations.

13:12.960 --> 13:15.420
Meg! Help me
with the Christmas decorations!

13:23.220 --> 13:24.847
Comments? Questions?

13:24.930 --> 13:27.599
- What the hell are you...
- I'm sorry. Chris had his hand up first.

13:27.683 --> 13:28.684
Chris?

13:28.767 --> 13:30.561
What's the capital of Maryland?

13:30.644 --> 13:32.229
I do not know,
but that's a very good question.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.480
Now, Lois?

13:33.564 --> 13:35.566
Peter, what the hell are you doing?

13:35.649 --> 13:37.234
First, it's not Peter.

13:37.317 --> 13:42.281
When I am in this outfit, I am Maxi Paddy,
the fiercest enemy of Heavy Flo.

13:42.364 --> 13:44.283
Peter, you look... Okay, that's clever...

13:44.366 --> 13:47.077
But, Peter, you look ridiculous.
Take that off.

13:47.160 --> 13:50.455
If you want to settle things
with your sister, just go talk to her.

13:50.539 --> 13:54.042
No, Lois, the only way to settle
a family dispute is in the cage.

13:54.126 --> 13:55.127
I mean, you don't understand.

13:55.210 --> 13:58.755
Karen made me feel worse than a guy
getting cut from a baseball team.

13:58.839 --> 14:00.048
You wanted to see me, Coach?

14:00.132 --> 14:03.844
I'm sorry, Kyle. You can't do this boring,
stupid thing with us.

14:07.598 --> 14:10.267
All right, Peter,
your sister's the real deal.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.978
So I arranged for you
to get some combat pointers

14:13.061 --> 14:15.814
from my old buddy, Steven Seagal.

14:15.898 --> 14:18.692
Uh, this... This fat guy?

14:18.775 --> 14:20.903
Yup. Go on, ask him anything.

14:20.986 --> 14:22.738
How... How did...

14:22.821 --> 14:24.323
Uh, why-why you so fat?

14:24.406 --> 14:26.658
Okay, ask him about
anything but his weight.

14:26.742 --> 14:28.076
Uh...

14:28.160 --> 14:30.913
Uh, you act Asian,
you look Native American,

14:30.996 --> 14:33.040
your name is possibly Jewish.

14:33.123 --> 14:34.416
What are you?

14:34.499 --> 14:35.709
He fat.

14:37.294 --> 14:39.630
All right, Peter,
most professional wrestlers

14:39.713 --> 14:41.924
become addicted to painkillers
at some point.

14:42.007 --> 14:44.259
So I figure, why don't we just start now?

14:44.343 --> 14:46.887
Uh... Okay, yeah, I'm in.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.430
Where you getting all these?

14:48.514 --> 14:49.932
Stepdaughter's purse.

14:50.015 --> 14:52.059
Ain't my problem.

14:52.601 --> 14:56.939
Man, I love putting my hand down my pants
when I'm on drugs.

14:57.022 --> 15:01.109
We should just go live on a boat
in some guy's backyard.

15:01.193 --> 15:03.445
So, you gonna do that wrestling stuff?

15:03.529 --> 15:05.364
Nah, I'm gonna stick with these.

15:05.447 --> 15:08.116
I would crime for more of these.

15:09.660 --> 15:11.912
Okay, now if you're gonna defeat
your sister in the ring,

15:11.995 --> 15:13.580
you got to get to the root of your fears.

15:13.664 --> 15:17.292
We got to go back to your childhood,
so I'm gonna hypnotize you.

15:17.376 --> 15:19.586
Okay, go back.

15:19.670 --> 15:22.089
Now, we need to go back in time.

15:24.508 --> 15:26.635
My jeans are husky.

15:26.718 --> 15:28.971
Okay, further. Further.

15:29.054 --> 15:30.514
Little further.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.975
Now, open your eyes
and tell me what you see.

15:33.058 --> 15:36.603
I see the six stations
of the Lord's order,

15:36.687 --> 15:38.856
and they will all burn!

15:38.939 --> 15:41.567
Okay, too far! Too far! Too far!
Come back. Come back.

15:41.650 --> 15:42.985
Come back.

15:43.068 --> 15:45.028
Hey, can I make my husky jeans

15:45.112 --> 15:46.613
into cutoffs for swimming?

15:46.697 --> 15:47.990
Ah, forget it. You're ready.

15:48.073 --> 15:50.075
Yeah, Peter. I think you're gonna win!

15:50.158 --> 15:52.619
All right!
Hey, thanks for all your help, you guys.

15:52.703 --> 15:55.622
You know, there's only two things

15:55.706 --> 15:58.750
put my sister in her place
and go to Chico's Monkey Farm.

16:00.085 --> 16:02.212
<i>Chico's Monkey Farm</i>

16:02.296 --> 16:04.214
<i>Come and have a howling good time</i>

16:04.298 --> 16:06.216
<i>Ooh-ooh, aah-aah, ooh-ooh, aah-aah</i>

16:06.300 --> 16:08.510
<i>Chico's Monkey Farm</i>

16:08.594 --> 16:10.470
<i>The only drive-through monkey farm</i>

16:10.554 --> 16:12.514
<i>- In Northern Southern Rhode Island</i>
<i>- Ooh, aah!</i>

16:12.598 --> 16:14.474
<i>Chico's Monkey Farm</i>

16:14.558 --> 16:17.978
<i>After a prolonged litigation</i>
<i>We're finally open again</i>

16:18.061 --> 16:19.104
<i>Ooh, aah!</i>

16:19.188 --> 16:20.564
<i>Chico's Monkey Farm</i>

16:20.647 --> 16:22.816
<i>There's a fair amount of paperwork</i>

16:22.900 --> 16:26.320
<i>Before you get to see a monkey</i>
<i>So allow for extra time</i>

16:26.403 --> 16:29.239
<i>- Ooh, aah!</i>
<i>- Chico's Monkey Farm</i>

16:29.323 --> 16:31.825
<i>Keep your windows rolled up</i>
<i>'Cause the monkeys</i>

16:31.909 --> 16:34.661
<i>Will pry 'em open</i>
<i>And they're known to strangle kids</i>

16:34.745 --> 16:36.830
<i>Ooh-ooh-ooh, aah-aah-aah!</i>

16:36.914 --> 16:40.167
<i>Chico's Monkey Farm!</i>
<i>Now open pending how it goes.</i>

16:52.554 --> 16:55.182
And we've got quite a match
tonight between Heavy Flo

16:55.265 --> 16:57.100
and another woman
whose name I've forgotten

16:57.184 --> 16:58.727
but I'm sure is a gross pun.

16:58.810 --> 17:00.062
Right you are, Bill.

17:00.145 --> 17:02.898
Tonight, she's up against
Her Vajesty's Secret Cervix.

17:02.981 --> 17:05.025
these two gals

17:05.108 --> 17:07.819
have over eight meters
of ass crack between them.

17:07.903 --> 17:09.404
One! Two! Three!

17:10.614 --> 17:12.074
It's over!

17:12.157 --> 17:17.538
And once again, a Heavy Flo
has ruined another lady's evening!

17:19.122 --> 17:21.208
You ain't no champ!

17:21.291 --> 17:23.502
Not till you go through me!

17:23.585 --> 17:24.795
Who the hell are you?

17:24.878 --> 17:28.298
I'm Maxi Paddy,
which is short for Maxine Patricia.

17:28.382 --> 17:30.843
I was named after my father,
Maxwell Patrick.

17:30.926 --> 17:33.762
But that's enough about me.
I'm here to kick your ass!

17:33.846 --> 17:35.055
Get out of here!

17:35.138 --> 17:37.516
I'm not fighting some fat loser
from the crowd.

17:37.599 --> 17:42.646
Huh. It looks like this Heavy Flo is pee,
because you're yellow!

17:42.729 --> 17:43.814
Oh!

17:43.897 --> 17:47.150
Well, that didn't quite track,
but the crowd seems to be on board.

17:47.234 --> 17:50.445
It sure does!
Looks like Heavy Flo has a challenger!

17:50.529 --> 17:52.865
All right, get up here, but make it quick.

17:52.948 --> 17:55.325
I got a <i>Lampoon</i> reunion to get to.

17:55.409 --> 17:57.077
Heavy Flo, always finding a way

17:57.160 --> 17:59.454
to drop her Harvard degree
into conversation.

17:59.538 --> 18:01.081
Yes, very off-putting, Bill.

18:01.164 --> 18:04.168
Those of us who went to Harvard
really don't appreciate it.

18:10.382 --> 18:11.800
Ow! Damn it, Karen!

18:11.884 --> 18:13.051
Karen?

18:13.135 --> 18:15.512
Peter, is that you?
What are you doing here?

18:15.596 --> 18:18.140
Something I should have done
a long time ago.

18:18.223 --> 18:21.185
I'm tired of you bullying me!
You're going down!

18:21.268 --> 18:23.520
- Butt-scratcher?
- Butt-scratcher!

18:50.547 --> 18:53.467
D-D-D-Don't, K-K-Karen!

18:53.550 --> 18:56.220
Toxic Shock! Toxic Shock!

18:58.263 --> 19:00.599
Oh, my God, she's taking it too far!

19:00.682 --> 19:02.976
Heavy Flo is gonna break this girl's arms!

19:03.060 --> 19:05.187
Woman's arms. Come on, Bill.

19:05.270 --> 19:07.272
N-N-No!

19:07.356 --> 19:09.399
Tell... Stewie...

19:09.483 --> 19:11.818
He's in charge of the show now.

19:14.238 --> 19:17.449
Say hello to Teen LaQueefa!

19:18.575 --> 19:21.453
One! Two! Three!

19:22.788 --> 19:24.331
I don't believe it!

19:24.414 --> 19:27.251
Heavy Flo is down,
and we have a new champion!

19:27.334 --> 19:31.505
I tell you, this is one for the books,
if anyone kept track of this nonsense!

19:32.256 --> 19:34.007
Wow, you really saved me!

19:34.091 --> 19:35.133
Thanks, stranger.

19:35.217 --> 19:36.760
Dad, it's me.

19:36.844 --> 19:39.346
Meg?

19:39.429 --> 19:41.223
It was you who saved me?

19:41.306 --> 19:42.599
That's right, Dad.

19:42.683 --> 19:45.352
Wow, even after all the crummy stuff
I've done to you?

19:45.435 --> 19:47.521
- But why?
- Because you're my dad.

19:47.604 --> 19:49.940
And I couldn't stand by
and watch you get hurt.

19:50.023 --> 19:51.441
Wow. Thanks, Meg.

19:51.525 --> 19:54.903
You know, that's something
even my own mom and dad never did for me.

19:54.987 --> 19:57.155
They just stood by
and let Karen pick on me.

19:57.239 --> 19:59.491
Well, you deserve better. We all do.

19:59.575 --> 20:04.162
You know, Meg, I'm really sorry
I treated you so badly over the years.

20:04.246 --> 20:06.874
I guess I was taking out
all the pain I felt on you.

20:06.957 --> 20:10.377
I understand. Better than anybody.

20:10.460 --> 20:12.379
But I still love you, Dad.

20:12.462 --> 20:14.464
I love you, too, Meg.

20:18.760 --> 20:22.556
Did somebody order
a hot-ass bitch and this lady?

20:22.639 --> 20:24.099
Oh, you're alive.

20:24.183 --> 20:26.310
Sorry, I was told I was in charge now.

20:26.393 --> 20:30.355
Well, if you die, this is kind of
the creative direction I'm leaning toward.

20:34.484 --> 20:37.821
Well, I'm proud of you, Dad.
You finally stood up for yourself.

20:37.905 --> 20:39.865
So, Peter, have you talked to Karen?

20:39.948 --> 20:43.118
I called, like, four times,
but she's not out of the coma yet.

20:43.202 --> 20:46.121
Apparently, they usually use fake chairs,
but Meg used a real one.

20:46.205 --> 20:47.915
Do they think she's gonna survive?

20:47.998 --> 20:49.249
It could go either way.

20:49.333 --> 20:51.293
- Hello?

20:52.336 --> 20:54.796
No, I think I'm a different blood type.

20:54.880 --> 20:56.256
No, I don't want to check.

20:56.340 --> 20:58.383
Doctor says there's nothing they can do.
