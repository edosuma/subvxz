WEBVTT

00:00.667 --> 00:01.960
You got this!

00:02.044 --> 00:03.711
I've got this.

00:04.003 --> 00:05.589
‐ That's it.
‐ Oh, bugger me!

00:05.672 --> 00:07.007
Oh no!

00:10.677 --> 00:11.470
Get me a car to Buffalo.

00:11.553 --> 00:12.739
You're going to the White House?

00:12.763 --> 00:14.556
Oh, yes! Time to do
some corporate begging.

00:14.640 --> 00:15.640
Oh!

00:15.849 --> 00:17.809
Oh, hey! Come on.

00:17.893 --> 00:18.769
I was just doing my job.

00:18.852 --> 00:20.521
Just did what we had to do.

00:20.604 --> 00:21.855
I did what I had to do.

00:21.939 --> 00:23.041
It's getting thicker!

00:23.065 --> 00:25.400
‐ This is your fault.
‐ It's Frank's fault!

00:25.484 --> 00:27.462
- ‐ He hit the big brown buttons.
- Frank!

00:27.486 --> 00:28.820
Ship him out!

00:28.904 --> 00:29.904
Frank! Frank!

00:29.947 --> 00:32.323
Calm, and I cannot stress this enough,

00:32.406 --> 00:33.909
the fuck down!

00:33.992 --> 00:36.453
These people
are humanity's finest,

00:36.537 --> 00:38.163
and they need‐‐

00:38.247 --> 00:39.915
The president will see you now.

00:39.998 --> 00:40.998
Great.

00:48.090 --> 00:50.318
<i>He nearly got Frank space‐lynched,</i>

00:50.342 --> 00:52.177
so what are we gonna do
about Judd?

00:52.261 --> 00:54.680
Two options.

00:54.763 --> 00:57.516
One, murder. And two,

00:57.599 --> 00:59.810
and I know I keep
looping back to this...

00:59.893 --> 01:00.686
murder.

01:00.769 --> 01:02.604
You keep saying that word,
Karen.

01:02.688 --> 01:05.107
You keep saying it.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.818
Okay, can you please
just let me fix your door?

01:07.901 --> 01:09.861
No. I'm going to do this myself.

01:09.945 --> 01:13.156
I may be a fake and a fraud
and a terrible lay

01:13.240 --> 01:15.117
and a credit risk and a tax‐dodger

01:15.200 --> 01:16.535
and an emotional homunculus,

01:16.618 --> 01:19.413
but I am still a useful,
functioning‐‐.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.099
Actually, can you do this?

01:21.123 --> 01:22.165
- ‐ Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:23.292 --> 01:25.043
- Baby!
- What?

01:25.127 --> 01:26.479
A passenger has just gone
into labor.

01:26.503 --> 01:28.106
- ‐ There's gonna be a baby!
- Whoa!

01:28.130 --> 01:29.590
Holy shit! We're having a baby?

01:29.673 --> 01:31.133
‐ Mr. Judd's in there.
‐ Why?

01:31.216 --> 01:33.594
He's, quote,
"executive producing" the birth.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.555
‐ Here.
‐ Yeah, yeah, leave it with me.

01:39.808 --> 01:41.160
- ‐ I'm fine. Yeah.
- You all right?

01:41.184 --> 01:43.312
That's it, come on!
Get it out of her!

01:43.395 --> 01:45.230
That's it. Hey! Hey!

01:45.314 --> 01:48.817
Vacuum extraction! My idea!
We're gonna suck a person

01:48.900 --> 01:50.611
- ‐ out of this person!
- Yeah.

01:50.694 --> 01:51.903
Let's go!

01:51.987 --> 01:53.867
God, the baby is going from a womb

01:53.905 --> 01:55.240
surrounded by bodily fluids

01:55.324 --> 01:57.367
to a ship surrounded
by bodily solids.

01:57.451 --> 01:58.869
Where did you come from,
eyeballs?

01:58.952 --> 02:00.954
Originally? Pennsylvania.

02:01.038 --> 02:02.080
Before the fires.

02:02.164 --> 02:05.083
Whoa!

02:07.961 --> 02:09.920
‐ I'll cut the string.
‐ Cord.

02:10.005 --> 02:12.257
Full Hakuna Matata!

02:12.341 --> 02:14.509
There we go. Hey...

02:14.593 --> 02:17.429
I'm gonna keep the placenta.
Fair's fair.

02:17.512 --> 02:20.182
Have this snap frozen.
Landmark human tissue.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.143
- You fucking killed it.
- What?

02:23.226 --> 02:25.729
- Oh...
- Like, I'm smiling.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.731
You killed it, like...

02:27.814 --> 02:28.690
It's a baby.

02:28.774 --> 02:30.233
Yeah, it's really‐‐
It's a good one.

02:32.000 --> 02:38.074

02:44.831 --> 02:46.375
People of Avenue 5,

02:46.458 --> 02:48.668
I bring you tidings
of great joy.

02:48.752 --> 02:52.130
At 1105 hours today,
we welcomed

02:52.214 --> 02:55.133
‐ the first ever bab‐‐
‐ The first baby born in space!

02:57.302 --> 02:58.696
‐ Oh, I'm so sorry, did you‐‐
‐ It's fine.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.531
‐ I just really wanted to say it.
‐ I'm so sorry.

03:00.555 --> 03:03.683
You know, I sometimes have this
terrible case of Karen Mouth

03:03.767 --> 03:06.144
and, you know...

03:06.228 --> 03:07.604
What's the name?

03:07.687 --> 03:09.231
Oh, now she's interested
in babies.

03:09.314 --> 03:12.818
No name as yet.
Current alias, AKA Space Baby.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.170
‐ A beautiful...
‐ Baby boy!

03:14.194 --> 03:15.779
‐ Little baby b‐‐
‐ Baby boy!

03:17.322 --> 03:18.990
I did it again! You know
what it was?

03:19.074 --> 03:21.326
'Cause you said "little," so‐‐

03:21.410 --> 03:22.953
and I just went straight
to "baby boy,"

03:23.036 --> 03:24.871
so I got there first,
otherwise we would've‐‐.

03:24.955 --> 03:26.498
Is that it?
Or is it your Karen Mouth

03:26.581 --> 03:27.833
that you can't shut?

03:27.916 --> 03:31.086
What is that?
Why is the ship beeping?

03:31.169 --> 03:34.297
You know‐‐ and this has
never happened before‐‐.

03:34.965 --> 03:36.258
I don't actually know.

03:36.341 --> 03:37.485
What does he look like?

03:37.509 --> 03:40.303
‐ Oh, he is adora‐‐
‐ Adora‐‐

03:40.387 --> 03:42.472
What is your damage?

03:42.556 --> 03:44.766
‐ We need to sort this‐‐
‐ Yeah, Captain, I'm on it.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.621
Presumably, it's a warning
of some kind.

03:48.645 --> 03:50.689
Well, yes, you don't usually
have a recurring beep

03:50.772 --> 03:52.441
to tell you
everything's going just fine.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.611
It's down here.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.530
Some‐‐ It's somewhere...

04:00.782 --> 04:02.784
No, it's... it's...

04:04.661 --> 04:06.037
No, it's not up here.

04:06.121 --> 04:08.457
Man, they really love
that baby, huh?

04:08.540 --> 04:10.667
Yeah, babies are like
New Zealanders.

04:10.751 --> 04:13.545
Everyone loves them
and the funny way they talk.

04:13.628 --> 04:16.173
‐ Oh, there's Iris.
‐ See that? See that?

04:16.255 --> 04:18.382
She never looks at me like that.

04:18.466 --> 04:20.510
She never gives me that look.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.637
Funny.

04:23.388 --> 04:24.931
‐ Are you hurting?
‐ Hmm?

04:26.308 --> 04:27.642
Is that baby hurting you?

04:30.353 --> 04:31.438
Yeah?

04:32.564 --> 04:36.943
Face it.
They prefer that baby to me.

04:37.986 --> 04:39.696
Baby gives them hope.

04:39.780 --> 04:43.241
All I give them is shitty‐yuck‐yuck.

04:43.325 --> 04:46.286
Not that it's a competition.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.954
Judd versus Baby.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.916
But if it were,
I'd destroy that baby.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.585
Physically, emotionally,
endurance‐wise.

04:53.668 --> 04:54.753
I'd finish that baby

04:54.836 --> 04:57.214
before he could get past
the first month.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.757
It wouldn't even be
a fair contest.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.110
One shot to the soft spot,
that baby's down for the count.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.345
Yeah, it wouldn't have
the upper body strength.

05:05.263 --> 05:09.184
Captain? Captain.
Uh, the ship is beeping.

05:09.267 --> 05:12.062
And I can tell you why.
I'm going to cover my mouth...

05:12.145 --> 05:14.815
because this
could cause mass distress.

05:14.898 --> 05:18.401
It's an oxygen beep.
Uh, we've got a leak.

05:20.695 --> 05:22.531
‐ Well‐‐ I mean, that‐‐
‐ Billie? Billie?

05:22.614 --> 05:24.741
I don't know
what else it could be,

05:24.825 --> 05:26.451
and maybe he's right?

05:26.535 --> 05:28.370
‐ I‐‐ I‐‐ I just‐‐
‐ We need oxygen!

05:28.453 --> 05:29.847
‐ I love oxygen!
‐ Captain, your mouth.

05:29.871 --> 05:31.474
- ‐ Cover your fucking mouth.
- Billie?

05:31.498 --> 05:33.458
Well, hopefully it's just one‐‐.

05:33.542 --> 05:34.584
Hopefully, it's just

05:34.668 --> 05:36.044
- ‐ one leaking tank...
- Okay.

05:36.127 --> 05:38.755
But if the recycling
system's screwed, then...

05:38.839 --> 05:39.840
so are we.

05:39.923 --> 05:42.592
The running out of air,
is it as bad as they say?

05:42.676 --> 05:44.261
‐ Or not as bad?
‐ Yeah, it's bad.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.744
I mean, like, first you get,
like, a grittiness in your eyes,

05:46.805 --> 05:49.099
then your tongue is literally
gonna boil in your mouth

05:49.182 --> 05:51.977
before you just pass out and you
just never wake up again.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.979
Don't forget the organ failure.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.439
Oh, I almost forgot
the organ failure.

05:56.523 --> 05:59.401
I've just seen
my perfect Space Baby.

05:59.484 --> 06:00.944
Iris, you should
prepare to enjoy

06:01.027 --> 06:02.267
your last moments of happiness,

06:02.320 --> 06:05.198
because we think
we may have an oxygen leak.

06:05.282 --> 06:06.533
- ‐ An oxygen leak?
- Shh!

06:06.616 --> 06:08.427
Freak out into your hand
and cover your mouth.

06:08.451 --> 06:10.304
- ‐ Do we have enough to get home?
- It depends.

06:10.328 --> 06:13.582
Vigorous activity would
drain this turkey in no time.

06:13.665 --> 06:15.959
I'm talking exercise, singing,

06:16.042 --> 06:18.086
lovemaking,
if you're doing it right.

06:18.169 --> 06:19.170
Ugh.

06:19.254 --> 06:20.797
Hey! Hi there. Howdy.

06:20.880 --> 06:22.424
You keep greeting people
in triplicate,

06:22.507 --> 06:24.467
we'll be dead by Tuesday.

06:24.551 --> 06:25.677
- ‐ Karen.
- Hey.

06:25.760 --> 06:26.904
Why do you all look so jumpy?

06:26.928 --> 06:31.016
We... have a leak.
We're running out of oxygen.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.184
A leak?!

06:33.268 --> 06:35.520
What is this ship made of,
tin foil?

06:37.230 --> 06:38.106
Hi, girl.

06:38.189 --> 06:39.691
I don't actually think
this is about

06:39.774 --> 06:41.526
that non‐combat‐ready baby.

06:41.610 --> 06:42.736
I think it's about

06:42.819 --> 06:45.905
what your inner voice
is telling you about yourself.

06:45.989 --> 06:48.199
‐ What is it saying?
‐ The one I'm using now?

06:48.283 --> 06:49.701
No, the voice inside your head.

06:49.784 --> 06:53.038
Oh, no, my thoughts connect
instantaneously with my mouth.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.372
It's extremely efficient.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.416
Clinically,
it's probably very unique.

06:57.208 --> 06:59.336
Iris!

06:59.419 --> 07:01.630
Okay, how about this?

07:03.173 --> 07:04.650
You need to change
the way they see you.

07:04.674 --> 07:07.093
You need to change the way
they see the shit.

07:09.304 --> 07:10.305
Wait...

07:12.057 --> 07:13.266
Are‐‐ Are you...

07:14.476 --> 07:16.436
Are you talking about...

07:16.519 --> 07:17.604
lasers?

07:20.315 --> 07:22.567
Specifically...

07:22.651 --> 07:27.322
illuminating the ring
of nasty shit

07:27.405 --> 07:31.284
around the ship
with some goddamn lasers?

07:32.285 --> 07:33.870
Iris!

07:35.664 --> 07:38.249
‐ Miss Mulcair?
‐ Hi.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.418
The President thanks you
for your visit,

07:40.502 --> 07:43.338
and I can confirm
we will be funding the rescue.

07:43.421 --> 07:44.923
Oh, knock me sideways!

07:45.006 --> 07:48.259
That is like diving into
a bath of beans!

07:48.343 --> 07:50.762
Well, once you clear it
with the Other President,

07:50.845 --> 07:51.845
you are good to go!

07:51.888 --> 07:54.349
I'm sorry?
The Other President?

07:54.432 --> 07:57.143
I assumed the Other President
was already across this.

07:57.227 --> 07:59.020
We don't like to bother
the Other President

07:59.104 --> 08:00.563
unless
it's absolutely necessary.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.315
‐ No?
‐ So, if you could just slip on

08:02.399 --> 08:04.025
these electrostatic shoe covers...

08:04.109 --> 08:06.945
‐ Right, okay, right.
‐ If we could just get a move on.

08:07.028 --> 08:10.865
Okay. Let's go and...
do this!

08:47.527 --> 08:50.697
Good morning and so forth.
Mm‐hmm.

08:50.780 --> 08:53.158
‐ Oh, Mr. Judd‐‐
‐ JUDD: Great.

08:53.241 --> 08:56.369
Shall we begin this meeting
forthwith heretofore, please?

08:58.913 --> 09:01.041
All right, so, uh, welcome

09:01.124 --> 09:05.837
to this first passenger‐crew
liaison meeting.

09:07.881 --> 09:10.008
Fucking hands!

09:10.091 --> 09:11.885
All you had to do
was hold the cup!

09:11.968 --> 09:14.345
- ‐ Fumbling bitches...
- Is he British?

09:14.429 --> 09:16.014
‐ No, he's doing a voice.
‐ Oh, okay.

09:16.097 --> 09:18.057
You know it's coming,
then you forget it's coming,

09:18.099 --> 09:19.660
‐ and it just‐‐
‐ JUDD: Set a reminder, uh,

09:19.684 --> 09:21.078
pre‐beep to remind me
of the big beep.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.913
‐ You got it, baby.
‐ Already on it, thank you, Matt.

09:22.937 --> 09:25.356
All right, so,
I think it would be fitting

09:25.440 --> 09:28.651
- ‐ to start with an apology.
- I accept.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.029
From you to me,
you big S‐gibbon,

09:31.112 --> 09:34.199
because you tried to fire
my husband out the ship!

09:34.282 --> 09:36.034
Mm‐mm. I never say sorry.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.869
Like my hero, Gandhi.

09:37.952 --> 09:40.705
All right. Agenda, shall we?

09:40.789 --> 09:42.207
I have a question.

09:42.290 --> 09:45.710
I would like a new cabin
away from my broken prophylactic

09:45.794 --> 09:46.954
‐ of a husband. ‐ Will you‐‐.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.589
All due respect, normo,
we have bigger fish to fry.

09:49.672 --> 09:51.716
Second that.
And we can't afford the air.

09:51.800 --> 09:53.093
- ‐ Right.
- Wait, why not?

09:54.511 --> 09:56.405
What do you mean,
you can't afford the air?

09:56.429 --> 09:58.890
‐ Iris, did you‐‐ did you just laugh?
‐ You're delirious.

09:58.973 --> 10:01.893
All right, so,
I have figured out a way

10:01.976 --> 10:05.021
to re‐perceive the turd sleeve
around this ship.

10:05.105 --> 10:08.108
Three words:
Theatrical lighting rig.

10:08.191 --> 10:11.736
And here's five:
What, what, and why?

10:11.820 --> 10:13.655
Uh... No, that's four.

10:13.738 --> 10:14.739
Fuck, I'm so tired.
Jesus.

10:14.823 --> 10:16.741
I'm sorry,
are we running out of air?

10:16.825 --> 10:18.201
- ‐ Yeah.
- Like, actual air?

10:18.284 --> 10:19.744
Not, like, cooking air

10:19.828 --> 10:21.704
or, you know, like,
air conditioning‐‐.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.581
In nine months,
so don't get pregnant,

10:23.665 --> 10:25.083
that'd be a complete
waste of time.

10:25.166 --> 10:28.002
Okay, I'm‐‐ I'm calm.
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

10:28.670 --> 10:30.421
Good. All right.

10:30.505 --> 10:32.841
‐ So, can we just focus‐‐
‐ I thought I was calm,

10:32.924 --> 10:35.093
but I am not fucking calm.
I don't wanna die!

10:35.176 --> 10:37.137
I don't wanna run out of air!

10:37.220 --> 10:38.471
Thank you.

10:46.312 --> 10:49.649
‐ Hey, Secretary of State.
‐ Hi, Judd Galaxy.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.485
I like your nails.

10:54.863 --> 10:56.739
‐ Thank you.
‐ You got any wax?

10:56.823 --> 10:59.325
‐ This string's dried out.
‐ What, crossbow wax?

10:59.409 --> 11:01.870
Ooh, let me have a look.
No, sorry.

11:01.953 --> 11:03.538
Oh, it's me.

11:05.874 --> 11:08.418
Okay. Do I just...?

11:08.501 --> 11:10.980
<i>Miss Mulcair, please clearly</i>

11:11.004 --> 11:12.297
<i>and audibly state your business.</i>

11:12.380 --> 11:16.050
Right, hello. Uh, I am here
on behalf of Judd Galaxy.

11:16.134 --> 11:19.137
We urgently need rescue funds.

11:19.220 --> 11:23.308
Four point two three
trillion dollars.

11:23.391 --> 11:26.227
I believe written materials
have been submitted directly...

11:26.978 --> 11:28.021
into you?

11:29.564 --> 11:31.724
<i>We will
redirect funds from the...</i>

11:31.774 --> 11:33.526
<i>National Child Welfare...</i>

11:33.610 --> 11:34.610
<i>program.</i>

11:34.652 --> 11:38.364
Oh. Oh, my God.
This‐‐ This is...

11:38.448 --> 11:41.034
everything!

11:41.117 --> 11:42.702
Thank you so much!

11:42.785 --> 11:45.121
I have been in such a dark place.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.748
Can I‐‐ No? No?

11:46.831 --> 11:48.333
Thank you. Thank you, thank you.

11:48.416 --> 11:50.394
<i>Please,
will you consider the removal</i>

11:50.418 --> 11:52.253
<i>of 500 non‐essential passengers?</i>

11:54.214 --> 11:55.590
Right.

11:55.673 --> 11:59.427
I absolutely hear...
what you're saying.

11:59.510 --> 12:02.764
It's just that that would raise
one or two

12:02.847 --> 12:04.974
‐ ethical questions‐‐
<i>‐ Thank you!</i>

12:05.058 --> 12:07.310
<i>Your query has been forwarded
to the...</i>

12:07.393 --> 12:08.746
<i>Department of Ethics.</i>

12:08.770 --> 12:10.772
‐ But, uh...
<i>‐ Goodbye. Have a nice day.</i>

12:10.855 --> 12:12.857
No. No, no, no, no.

12:12.941 --> 12:15.109
All right,
so I appreciate that some of us

12:15.193 --> 12:17.612
are sleep‐victimized. However,

12:17.695 --> 12:20.323
bearing in mind
the scarcity of resources,

12:20.406 --> 12:22.533
can we try to keep lang'
at an abs' min'?

12:22.617 --> 12:26.454
‐ Wh‐‐ What are you saying?
‐ I am trying to conserve oxygen

12:26.537 --> 12:28.790
by... 'bridging my w'rds.

12:28.873 --> 12:30.708
Well, it's highly,
highly confusing.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.669
You see, you did not need
the second "highly,"

12:32.752 --> 12:34.879
‐ one would've s'ff'c'd.
‐ Would‐‐

12:34.963 --> 12:35.964
‐ Sufficed.
‐ Ugh.

12:36.047 --> 12:37.882
‐ Jesus frazzling Christ!
‐ Oh, my God.

12:37.966 --> 12:40.260
Can we skip
the missing letters round?

12:40.343 --> 12:42.262
I've just reconsidered
your earlier point,

12:42.345 --> 12:44.389
re: An apology. S'ry.

12:46.849 --> 12:48.393
‐ Iris, you laughed!
‐ Fine! I'm s‐‐

12:48.476 --> 12:50.371
‐ What's the matter with you?
‐ I‐‐ I find it amusing.

12:50.395 --> 12:53.564
I don't know why,
it just... beep!

12:53.648 --> 12:55.900
Why are you being such a baby,
Iris? Hmm?

12:55.984 --> 12:57.986
You like babies so much
you wanna be one?

12:58.069 --> 13:00.738
Question: Are we really
running out of air?

13:00.822 --> 13:03.574
- ‐ Supplemental: What the fuck?
- Yes!

13:03.658 --> 13:05.034
To your first question.

13:05.118 --> 13:07.412
I don't know how to answer
your second question.

13:07.495 --> 13:10.081
But Matty and
I have come up with

13:10.164 --> 13:12.500
a series
of oxygen conservation policies.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.043
"Oxygen conservation policies."

13:14.127 --> 13:15.479
Well, that's a lungful
right there.

13:15.503 --> 13:17.672
Let's try to keep the energy
positive around Mr. Judd

13:17.755 --> 13:19.549
‐ while he pupates.
‐ While he what?

13:19.632 --> 13:20.800
While he pupates.

13:20.883 --> 13:23.261
I've gone through a period
of serious introspection

13:23.344 --> 13:24.387
since last night.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.179
Okay, so first of‐‐.

13:26.222 --> 13:29.267
Oh, also, you should know,
I‐‐ I tent now.

13:29.350 --> 13:32.645
First up, no running.
Leads to panting.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.397
‐ Don't do it.
‐ Oh, secondly,

13:34.480 --> 13:38.234
fat people shouldn't use stairs,
and avoid any incline.

13:38.317 --> 13:40.820
Direct! Merciless. Yes.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.739
Uh, fat people should not
exert themselves.

13:42.822 --> 13:46.075
‐ By fat people, do you mean...
‐ Anyone over two‐‐.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.119
Two hundred
and fifty‐seven pounds.

13:48.202 --> 13:50.455
- Mm‐mm.
- Mm‐hmm.

13:50.538 --> 13:51.748
- Mm‐hmm?
- Mm‐hmm.

13:51.831 --> 13:56.085
Okay, uh, yes, a 257‐pound cutoff.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.939
So what are we going to do? We're
gonna weigh people as they go about their‐‐

13:58.963 --> 14:01.358
‐ Are you really asking questions about‐‐
‐ JUDD: You know what? Everyone‐‐

14:01.382 --> 14:04.135
please get outta here.
I‐‐ I need a safe space to create.

14:04.218 --> 14:07.138
Just me, Matty, and the person
whose name I ignored.

14:07.221 --> 14:08.514
- ‐ Who's that?
- You.

14:08.598 --> 14:09.640
Okay.

14:09.724 --> 14:11.809
That guy is a complete moron.
The more he talks,

14:11.893 --> 14:14.562
‐ the more in danger we all are.
‐ Unless we 'M' him.

14:14.645 --> 14:16.165
Okay, Karen,
you gotta stop saying that.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.274
That is clearly not an option‐‐

14:19.108 --> 14:20.318
Life coached by Matt?

14:20.401 --> 14:22.278
That's like being taught
to drive by a hen.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.363
We're running out of oxygen
and he's "pupating."

14:24.447 --> 14:25.740
He could kill us all.

14:25.823 --> 14:30.870
Well, you know, Iris,
we could... sedate him.

14:30.953 --> 14:33.664
Yeah, no, that could work.
That could actually work.

14:33.748 --> 14:35.166
Well, we could double the dose?

14:35.249 --> 14:36.334
He might have a stroke,

14:36.417 --> 14:38.628
then you'll only be physically
wiping his ass.

14:38.711 --> 14:42.298
Right. Where are we gonna get
sedatives and a dart gun?

14:42.381 --> 14:43.674
Well, Matt monitors the supply,

14:43.758 --> 14:46.719
and I bet he has full access
to whatev' they got down there.

14:46.803 --> 14:48.346
Sir, it's Rav for you.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.681
We round Jupiter in three
minutes and lose comms.

14:50.765 --> 14:52.850
My cabin is closest,
so stride with me.

14:52.934 --> 14:56.270
Excuse me! Karen Kelly!
Make a hole, or I will!

15:00.733 --> 15:02.360
Gah...

15:02.443 --> 15:03.945
Now, honey,

15:04.028 --> 15:05.321
I have an update for you,

15:05.404 --> 15:08.449
and I don't want you
to go all flappy on me.

15:08.533 --> 15:09.826
Okay...

15:09.909 --> 15:11.869
The ship is leaking oxygen.

15:11.953 --> 15:12.995
From what I understand,

15:13.079 --> 15:15.456
it will be like drowning
with dirt in your mouth

15:15.540 --> 15:16.791
and a tractor on your chest.

15:17.625 --> 15:18.626
Okay.

15:19.836 --> 15:21.796
That's fine.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.423
Fuck.

15:28.094 --> 15:30.847
Sorry. I'm sorry.
It's only oxygen.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.140
All right.

15:32.223 --> 15:33.307
So don't talk,

15:33.391 --> 15:36.018
because then you will last
marginally longer.

15:36.102 --> 15:36.936
Attaboy.

15:37.019 --> 15:38.896
Okay, guys,
I think we're on. Yeah.

15:38.980 --> 15:41.780
And we don't have long with her,
and it could get a little bit glitchy.

15:41.858 --> 15:43.252
<i>Hello‐‐ speaking‐‐ Hello?</i>

15:43.276 --> 15:44.795
<i>Great. Hi! I‐‐ start speaking.</i>

15:44.819 --> 15:46.463
<i>I'm gonna start speaking
before‐‐ get cut off.</i>

15:46.487 --> 15:48.781
<i>I have some good news
and some not so good news.</i>

15:48.865 --> 15:52.034
The good news is... we have funding!

15:52.118 --> 15:54.745
Yay! Come on!

15:54.829 --> 15:56.581
Wh‐‐ What was that?
What did she‐‐

15:56.664 --> 15:59.333
- ‐ She said they had funding.
- Shush! Yes, yes, shush!

15:59.417 --> 16:02.297
The not so good news isthe Other President
suggested we explore losing...

16:02.336 --> 16:05.131
500 NEPs,
but I rejected that,

16:05.214 --> 16:09.260
I said, "No, we are not killing
500 people, not today!"

16:09.343 --> 16:11.304
<i>Other President
sug‐‐ we explore</i>

16:11.387 --> 16:13.598
<i>losing 500 NEPs‐‐</i>

16:13.681 --> 16:16.017
Wait, wait, wait.
No, no, no. No, no, no! No!

16:16.100 --> 16:18.895
No, now Earth is the other side of Jupiter.

16:18.978 --> 16:21.814
‐ What's NEPs?
‐ Non‐essential personnel, like‐‐

16:21.898 --> 16:24.650
- ‐ Mm‐‐ Mm‐mm.
- Okay. That is not on the table.

16:24.734 --> 16:28.571
We are not getting rid of
500 non‐essential personnel.

16:28.654 --> 16:29.947
My hands always get clammy

16:30.031 --> 16:31.908
whenever I shower
in a strange room.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.117
Fuck you, Doug!

16:33.201 --> 16:35.786
How are you here?
‐ Yeah, what the actual frig?

16:35.870 --> 16:38.164
Are you wearing Frank's clothes?

16:38.247 --> 16:39.498
‐ Two sugars?
‐ Yeah.

16:39.582 --> 16:42.293
I have just been ordered
homeless by Herman Judd,

16:42.376 --> 16:44.253
so I no longer have access
to a bathroom.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.172
Oh, great. You see this, Frank?

16:46.255 --> 16:48.132
He's using you
as a toilet friend.

16:48.216 --> 16:49.610
Are you guys
seriously considering

16:49.634 --> 16:51.302
getting rid of 500 passengers?

16:51.385 --> 16:54.055
No, and you are not gonna say it
out there. All right?

16:54.138 --> 16:55.657
And you're particularly
not gonna say it

16:55.681 --> 16:57.326
in front of Herman Judd.

16:57.350 --> 17:00.061
Oh, you‐‐ monotonal fuck!
‐ Fuck you, Doug!

17:05.148 --> 17:07.734
Good morning, everyone!

17:07.818 --> 17:09.779
We finally have a baby name.

17:10.363 --> 17:11.405
Kayden!

17:14.242 --> 17:16.993
‐ Kayden?
‐ That's an asshole name!

17:17.078 --> 17:19.329
Okay, it's just a word.

17:19.413 --> 17:21.249
And you're an asshole, asshole.

17:23.166 --> 17:24.502
‐ Oh, you.
‐ Doug.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.253
You look different.
Fatter, maybe?

17:26.337 --> 17:28.506
No, it's probably just
my spirit swelling

17:28.589 --> 17:31.425
now that I'm not with you.

17:31.509 --> 17:34.071
‐ Hey, you're hiding something.
‐ I don't know what you're talking about.

17:34.095 --> 17:36.180
I know that, Doug,
that's your factory setting.

17:36.264 --> 17:38.474
Actually, I‐‐ I have been
made privy to something.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.017
Okay, so you know about

17:40.101 --> 17:41.769
‐ the oxygen.
‐ The passengers.

17:41.852 --> 17:43.187
‐ Oxygen?
‐ The shortage.

17:43.271 --> 17:44.689
‐ There's a shortage of air?
‐ Yes!

17:44.772 --> 17:46.440
‐ Holy fuck! Are you kid‐‐
‐ Okay, okay‐‐

17:46.524 --> 17:47.960
‐ Oh, my God, are you serious?
‐ Stop panicking.

17:47.984 --> 17:49.986
This is when one panics!
We are running out of air

17:50.069 --> 17:52.321
and they're shooting 500
passengers out of the airlock.

17:52.405 --> 17:53.405
‐ What?
‐ Yes!

17:53.447 --> 17:55.133
The airlock? Oh, my God!
Oh, my fucking God!

17:55.157 --> 17:56.426
‐ That's horrible.
‐ This is panicking!

17:56.450 --> 17:58.095
‐ Why can you panic and I can't‐‐
‐ I'm not panicking!

17:58.119 --> 18:00.621
‐ Yeah, neither was I!
‐ Then stop and lower your voice!

18:00.705 --> 18:01.872
Fine.

18:01.956 --> 18:05.543
Also, the captain is speaking
in that British voice‐‐

18:05.626 --> 18:08.337
‐ Yeah, I heard that.
‐ All right, listen, fucker,

18:08.421 --> 18:11.048
if they start suggesting names
of passengers,

18:11.132 --> 18:12.651
let's not suggest each other,
all right?

18:12.675 --> 18:14.236
‐ That's actually a really good‐‐
‐ Okay, fine.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.386
‐ Good plan.
‐ All right.

18:15.469 --> 18:16.721
Put your hard‐on away.

18:16.804 --> 18:18.514
This is purely self‐preservation.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.890
Yeah, I think the same thing.

18:19.974 --> 18:20.891
‐ Great.
‐ All right, see you I‐‐

18:20.975 --> 18:22.286
‐ See you around.
‐ Okay. See you never.

18:22.310 --> 18:23.728
Come on.

18:23.811 --> 18:25.855
‐ Fuck you!
‐ No, fuck you, Doug!

18:27.565 --> 18:28.649
Do you wanna‐‐.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.987
Okay, Matt, uh...

18:37.533 --> 18:39.201
Uh, I‐‐ I, um...

18:39.285 --> 18:41.305
- ‐ I need you to hook me up.
- What do you need?

18:41.329 --> 18:43.122
Synthetic veal?
Porno? Mint jelly?

18:43.205 --> 18:44.665
All of them, if you can.

18:44.749 --> 18:47.084
- Jesus!
- ‐ But first, I‐‐ I, uh...

18:47.168 --> 18:51.547
I actually want lots and lots
and lots of sedatives.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.925
Look, my area of expertise
is pretty limited.

18:55.009 --> 18:57.553
It's basically recreational
barbiturates,

18:57.637 --> 19:00.806
Eastern sex practices, Christmas music.

19:00.890 --> 19:04.727
But I do know suffering,
and you're suffering.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.605
So I just need a little bit more
information to make sure

19:07.688 --> 19:10.733
I'm not causing more harm
than I'm fixing.

19:12.485 --> 19:14.570
‐ I was bullied at school.
‐ Was it your ears?

19:14.654 --> 19:15.905
What? No. What do you mean?

19:15.988 --> 19:17.257
‐ What's wrong with my ears?
‐ Nothing.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.909
But that is what I would
go in on, if I was bullying you.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.118
I'd make you self‐conscious

19:21.202 --> 19:22.679
about something
that isn't even a thing

19:22.703 --> 19:24.705
because it makes you
question your sanity.

19:24.789 --> 19:27.875
Ain't that right,
you jar‐eared Dumbo fuck?

19:29.085 --> 19:30.628
‐ It's brutal.
‐ I‐‐ Yeah‐‐ Mm.

19:30.711 --> 19:33.589
You're right, I hate my ears.
Yeah.

19:33.673 --> 19:34.941
‐ Sedatives?
‐ I mean, look at you.

19:34.965 --> 19:36.801
You're like a gimp on a leash
right now.

19:36.884 --> 19:38.684
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ You'd do anything for these drugs.

19:38.719 --> 19:40.479
‐ Anything.
‐ And if I don't give 'em to you,

19:40.554 --> 19:42.348
you're probably gonna go
below decks...

19:42.431 --> 19:43.742
and get them from the guys
down there.

19:43.766 --> 19:45.702
But you're gonna have to
sexually humiliate yourself.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.144
You are so good.
You're right.

19:47.228 --> 19:49.814
I was this close
to going down there and...

19:49.897 --> 19:51.440
showing someone my bottom.

19:57.780 --> 20:00.991
Well, I...
I got the, um, the sleeping...

20:01.075 --> 20:03.285
‐ Oh.
‐ Yeah. Take two of these,

20:03.369 --> 20:05.496
it's like you've died
and gone to the opera.

20:05.579 --> 20:06.765
All right, so give me one

20:06.789 --> 20:09.583
because I'm so tired
that my hair hurts me.

20:09.667 --> 20:12.086
Oh, no.
These are for, um...

20:12.169 --> 20:15.256
what's the‐‐ who's the guy
who runs Judd Industries?

20:15.339 --> 20:16.841
- Judd.
- Yes.

20:16.924 --> 20:21.303
So, apparently, even, uh,
Space Baby can't sleep.

20:21.387 --> 20:22.930
Respectfully, fuck him.

20:23.013 --> 20:25.349
No, seriously, 'cause he's‐‐
he's in an incubator,

20:25.433 --> 20:27.184
those things are soundproofed
to balls.

20:27.268 --> 20:30.146
I'll take the sedatives,
and I'll go Judd drug.

20:30.229 --> 20:33.232
No, Karen, you will kill him.
There's a difference.

20:33.315 --> 20:35.943
Okay, so you two give me the, um...

20:37.653 --> 20:40.656
them things, and then I'll go...

20:41.282 --> 20:42.283
What?

20:42.366 --> 20:43.701
I'll go to‐‐ Who they for?

20:45.494 --> 20:47.514
‐ I'll take them. I'll take‐‐
‐ Oh, no, no, Billie, Billie, no‐‐

20:47.538 --> 20:50.267
‐ Yeah, but I'm gonna give them‐‐
‐ Billie, give them to me. ‐ Okay‐‐.

20:50.291 --> 20:51.375
Oh, look, it's the king!

20:51.459 --> 20:52.793
‐ Where?
‐ A‐ha!

20:52.877 --> 20:55.963
In your face, you and‐‐
and the other one.

20:56.046 --> 20:58.007
Okay. Michele's an engineer,

20:58.090 --> 20:59.359
you tell him
exactly what you want.

20:59.383 --> 21:01.802
- ‐ Get as technical as you like.
- Okay.

21:02.720 --> 21:03.554
Michele, huh?

21:03.637 --> 21:05.431
I don't like boys
with girls' names.

21:05.514 --> 21:06.640
Okay, so...

21:07.892 --> 21:13.314
We fire the glitter at the turds
as we turn the lasers on?

21:13.397 --> 21:16.317
Or... sequins.

21:16.400 --> 21:22.406
Maybe sequin bombs that we make
from degradable plastics,

21:22.490 --> 21:25.868
and then shoot them
at the turds.

21:25.951 --> 21:30.122
I'm thinking six
every two minutes,

21:30.206 --> 21:33.000
to ensure a steady shimmer.

21:33.083 --> 21:36.420
Then glitter, then confetti,

21:36.504 --> 21:41.217
then, maybe, fairy lights,
if we all feel we've earned it.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.927
Okay, read it back to me.

21:43.010 --> 21:44.094
Let's make a sex tape!

21:44.178 --> 21:45.805
Get out of my line of sight.

21:50.392 --> 21:51.685
Action.

21:52.645 --> 21:55.022
Herman Judd here,
with a brief word.

21:55.105 --> 21:57.691
<i>Indeed, all of our words
must now be brief.</i>

21:57.775 --> 22:00.402
<i>That is because we're
running out of breathable air.</i>

22:02.196 --> 22:04.907
I had intended to ease
into that one.

22:04.990 --> 22:08.494
We will plug this leak.
But until we do,

22:08.577 --> 22:10.955
you must remain
breathing steadily

22:11.038 --> 22:13.791
to minimize all oxygen usage.

22:13.874 --> 22:17.586
And cut out all
unnecessary conversation.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.964
<i>No sighing, no gasping,</i>

22:20.047 --> 22:23.259
<i>no unnecessary sneezing,
no flouncing.</i>

22:23.342 --> 22:25.678
<i>If you have to be
passive aggressive,</i>

22:25.761 --> 22:27.513
do it only with your eyes.

22:28.931 --> 22:30.140
Relax.

22:30.224 --> 22:31.600
<i>Iris!</i>

22:31.684 --> 22:33.936
No, no, no, wait.
This is recorded. That's...

22:34.019 --> 22:35.104
that's not the actual beep.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.815
<i>But do remain
breathing calmly.</i>

22:37.898 --> 22:40.484
That's the actual beep.

22:40.568 --> 22:43.571
That is now a legal requirement.

22:44.613 --> 22:45.698
Thanks, gang.

22:48.492 --> 22:50.132
Okay, I'm gonna tell a joke now.

22:50.202 --> 22:52.746
The setup is that
there are three men

22:52.830 --> 22:55.040
of three different
nationalities.

22:55.124 --> 22:56.434
I won't tell you
which nationalities,

22:56.458 --> 22:58.168
'cause otherwise
you might find it amusing.

22:58.252 --> 23:00.296
The punchline is that
one of the men in the joke

23:00.379 --> 23:01.755
is considerably
more parsimonious

23:01.839 --> 23:04.133
than the other two men
in the joke.

23:04.216 --> 23:05.718
Thus concludes the joke.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.095
That was not funny.

23:09.430 --> 23:10.931
Here it comes.

23:13.809 --> 23:15.060
Iris!

23:16.645 --> 23:18.480
As I walk up,
there's these cars

23:18.564 --> 23:20.232
falling out of the bed.
It was just‐‐.

23:20.316 --> 23:22.443
What is the nature
of this conversation?

23:22.526 --> 23:24.862
Uh, I'm just talking about
my grandchildren.

23:24.945 --> 23:26.864
Would you classify it
as essential?

23:26.947 --> 23:28.490
News flash: It isn't.

23:30.200 --> 23:32.578
Okay, now I'm gonna do
some oxygen‐efficient banter

23:32.661 --> 23:33.746
with the audience.

23:33.829 --> 23:35.789
‐ Ma'am, where are you from?
‐ Utah.

23:37.791 --> 23:38.709
That's nice.

23:38.792 --> 23:40.794
You are banal as shit.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.429
I hear ya, honey.

23:50.512 --> 23:52.932
Shoehorns are weird, aren't they?

23:53.933 --> 23:56.352
Thus concludes
the shoehorns section.

23:56.936 --> 23:57.978
Thank you.

24:06.362 --> 24:07.464
I thought I'd set up‐‐

24:07.488 --> 24:09.128
I can't‐‐ I can't. I'm sorry.

24:10.115 --> 24:12.701
I said, I thought I'd set up
in a space

24:12.785 --> 24:14.578
where everyone feels welcome.

24:14.662 --> 24:16.497
In God's office?

24:16.580 --> 24:18.958
Jesus, Vishnu, Allah,
Karen Kelly.

24:19.041 --> 24:22.169
I think I have
a ways to go just yet.

24:22.252 --> 24:23.355
- Sedatives.
- Oh‐‐.

24:23.379 --> 24:24.755
Ryan!

24:24.838 --> 24:28.258
Get ready to have your butt
and/or ball blown off.

24:28.342 --> 24:31.345
Mr. Judd is about
to perform his first miracle.

24:31.428 --> 24:34.556
We're gonna sparklify
the Halo of Crud.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.435
I have an update.

24:38.519 --> 24:42.106
Space Baby has jaundice.
He's on a respirator.

24:42.189 --> 24:44.942
Jaundice?
Somebody's got a weak liver.

24:45.025 --> 24:46.211
- ‐ Is he okay?
- He's fine,

24:46.235 --> 24:48.237
just laying there
with his oxygen mask.

24:48.320 --> 24:49.446
Greedy little fuck.

24:49.530 --> 24:52.199
Yeah! There's my girl.
Welcome back. Missed you, girl.

24:52.282 --> 24:55.077
Yeah, fuck Space Baby,
stealing all our oxygen.

24:55.160 --> 24:57.097
Who's stealing
the oxygen? What's going on?

24:57.121 --> 24:58.455
We just heard the news.

24:58.539 --> 24:59.748
Oh, shit. They told you?

24:59.832 --> 25:01.672
About the 500 NEPs
they're shooting into space?

25:01.709 --> 25:03.353
What? Doug, what are you doing?

25:03.377 --> 25:05.021
‐ You're such an idiot.
‐ I'm whispering so we're‐‐

25:05.045 --> 25:06.964
Shh, shh, shh‐‐

25:07.047 --> 25:08.757
Quiet!

25:08.841 --> 25:10.884
You... chattering...

25:11.427 --> 25:12.803
fucks!

25:12.886 --> 25:13.886
Can you hear me?

25:13.929 --> 25:15.055
‐ Yes.
‐ I can.

25:15.139 --> 25:17.141
‐ What about now?
‐ Yes. It was the same.

25:17.224 --> 25:18.264
What about now?

25:18.308 --> 25:19.308
‐ Too low.
‐ Too low.

25:19.351 --> 25:20.394
Okay, I'll go up.

25:20.477 --> 25:22.104
Bless you.

25:22.187 --> 25:23.772
Oxygen‐‐

25:23.856 --> 25:24.982
Fuck!

25:25.065 --> 25:26.233
Shut up, Frank!

25:27.818 --> 25:28.986
Now that you have‐‐

25:29.069 --> 25:30.946
Guys. Please. Guys.
‐ Oh, my God.

25:31.030 --> 25:32.573
That's like a full tank.

25:34.700 --> 25:37.327
You have to think
before you speak.

25:37.411 --> 25:38.787
And then, think again.

25:38.871 --> 25:41.206
And then think,
"I shouldn't speak."

25:41.290 --> 25:43.625
And then, don't speak.

25:44.585 --> 25:45.753
Iris!

25:45.836 --> 25:47.004
‐ Fuck you, Doug!
‐ Hey, you.

25:47.087 --> 25:48.338
What are NEPs?

25:48.422 --> 25:50.174
They're non‐essential personnel.

25:50.257 --> 25:51.550
What?!

25:52.634 --> 25:55.054
Iris, will you shut the fuck up?

25:55.137 --> 25:58.057
Is it true? You're just gonna
kill 500 passengers?

25:58.140 --> 25:59.933
Why wasn't I notified?

26:00.768 --> 26:02.311
Was I notified?

26:02.394 --> 26:03.604
When was I notified?

26:03.687 --> 26:06.607
Who are you to determine
who is essential?

26:06.690 --> 26:10.152
I can't go. I'm the only
radiologist in outer space.

26:10.235 --> 26:11.862
Darrell, I'm standing
right here!

26:11.945 --> 26:14.740
We've been colleagues for years!

26:14.823 --> 26:16.825
It's not an oxygen beep.

26:16.909 --> 26:19.203
It's not an oxygen beep!

26:19.286 --> 26:21.872
I checked all the tanks,
and the beeping

26:21.955 --> 26:25.334
is the ship telling us
to recalibrate for the baby.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.544
There's an extra passenger.

26:27.628 --> 26:29.046
It needs to recalibrate.

26:29.129 --> 26:30.047
There's no oxygen‐‐.

26:30.130 --> 26:31.399
That would be
the other reason.

26:31.423 --> 26:32.859
Oh, my‐‐
‐ What, you‐you didn't

26:32.883 --> 26:35.135
‐ rule that out already, huh?
‐ Shut up, Spike.

26:35.219 --> 26:37.179
There is air.
There is enough air

26:37.262 --> 26:40.349
for maybe some of you
to thank me. I'm Billie.

26:40.432 --> 26:41.517
We have air?

26:41.600 --> 26:43.727
‐ Yeah, we have air.
‐ So we can shout?

26:43.811 --> 26:45.312
If you want to, I guess, yes.

26:45.395 --> 26:46.956
You guys were trying to kill us!

26:46.980 --> 26:48.500
Yeah, you had a list going!
Guess what?

26:48.565 --> 26:50.067
Now we're gonna make
a fucking list!

26:50.150 --> 26:52.319
‐ And you all...
‐ I don't even care about names,

26:52.402 --> 26:53.529
I just want blood.

26:53.612 --> 26:55.739
And... light 'em up!

26:57.658 --> 26:59.910
- Oh, my...
- Oh!

26:59.993 --> 27:01.453
Wow.

27:01.537 --> 27:03.539
Oh, my God, it's beautiful!

27:04.998 --> 27:06.291
It is beautiful.

27:07.417 --> 27:09.253
Until you really think about it.

27:09.336 --> 27:12.089
Who knew shit
could be so enchanting?

27:12.172 --> 27:14.883
Me. I did. I knew.

27:14.967 --> 27:19.304
He's transformed the most
disgusting thing imaginable

27:19.388 --> 27:23.308
into a kaleidoscope
of butt truffles!

27:23.392 --> 27:26.687
Well, you gotta say,
he knows his audience.

27:26.770 --> 27:29.690
So... he lives.
For tonight.

27:29.773 --> 27:31.209
Okay, it's over.

27:31.233 --> 27:32.484
The nightmare is over.

27:32.568 --> 27:35.320
This‐‐ this part
of the nightmare is over.

27:38.365 --> 27:40.158
Congratulations.

27:40.242 --> 27:42.619
Why don't you give yourself
a little pat on the back,

27:42.703 --> 27:44.204
or the ass?

27:44.288 --> 27:47.291
Give your ass a little squeeze,
and then...

27:47.374 --> 27:49.960
go make love to yourself
in a sleazy motel.

27:51.879 --> 27:52.963
You earned it.

27:53.046 --> 27:54.357
You're really fucking weird,
dude.

27:54.381 --> 27:55.941
I don't wanna
do these hangouts anymore.

27:56.008 --> 27:57.467
They make me kinda sick.

27:57.551 --> 27:59.720
- That's okay.
- No, it isn't.

28:07.561 --> 28:10.188
Your ears are beautiful.

28:11.064 --> 28:12.065
To me.

28:14.192 --> 28:16.904
It's the most plausible
he's looked in weeks.

28:23.827 --> 28:25.913
I'm gonna miss talking to ya,
sweetie.

29:37.484 --> 29:38.628
I actually see a face there.

29:38.652 --> 29:40.779
I see the pope's face,
Pope John Paul II.

29:41.029 --> 29:42.739
J.P. was one of the good ones,
too.

29:42.990 --> 29:44.491
Wasn't even a Nazi in his youth.

29:45.951 --> 29:49.663
There's been talk about ejecting
500 people from the ship.

29:50.080 --> 29:52.416
‐ It is the talk of Satan.
‐ Oh, cast him out!

29:52.499 --> 29:54.668
Amen!

29:56.461 --> 29:57.581
<i>Who is Harrison?</i>

29:57.629 --> 29:59.509
