WEBVTT

00:01.968 --> 00:03.833
The old-fashioned barbershop...

00:05.705 --> 00:08.731
...is, unfortunately, becoming a thing
of the past. What went wrong?

00:08.908 --> 00:14.073
First of all, he needs a $20,000 chair
to make a three dollar tip.

00:14.247 --> 00:17.978
I say, cut back on the chair,
update the magazines.

00:18.718 --> 00:21.346
Why do barbers always display
that license?

00:21.521 --> 00:23.182
There's no laws in haircutting...

00:23.356 --> 00:26.086
...except show every customer
the back of their head.

00:26.459 --> 00:27.653
I don't wanna see the back.

00:27.827 --> 00:30.557
Why see something that I'm never
gonna see at any other time?

00:30.730 --> 00:32.095
When I buy pants...

00:32.265 --> 00:36.326
...two salesmen don't lift me up and
go, "How do you like the crotch?"

00:36.503 --> 00:38.994
If I wanted to see everything,
I would've been a fly.

00:44.811 --> 00:46.506
Well, George, we here at Sanalac...

00:46.679 --> 00:49.204
...like to think of ourselves
as fairly progressive.

00:49.382 --> 00:51.782
We have a small but prestigious
group of clients.

00:51.951 --> 00:56.217
A lot of people consider me
small and prestigious.

00:57.123 --> 00:58.954
That's funny, George.

00:59.125 --> 01:00.820
-You're very quick.
-Oh, well.

01:00.994 --> 01:02.518
I feel like I don't...

01:02.695 --> 01:05.425
I don't have to explain
every little thing to you.

01:05.598 --> 01:07.293
You understand everything
immediately.

01:07.467 --> 01:09.628
I enjoy understanding.

01:11.104 --> 01:12.901
I want you to have this job.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.904
-Of course...
-Stu Zimmer's on line two.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.134
Great. Thanks.

01:17.310 --> 01:19.676
I've gotta take this call. Listen...

01:19.846 --> 01:21.905
...I'm really glad that you came in.

01:24.084 --> 01:26.279
"I want you to have this job.

01:27.053 --> 01:29.078
Of course..."

01:29.456 --> 01:31.788
-Yeah?
-That's it.

01:32.559 --> 01:33.787
-What do you mean?
-What?

01:33.960 --> 01:36.656
He never finished. He got a call.
That was the end.

01:36.830 --> 01:39.458
-"Of course" was the last thing?
-Maybe he was gonna say:

01:39.632 --> 01:42.328
"Of course, I have to check
with my associates."

01:42.502 --> 01:45.665
"I want you to have this job.
Of course, the board of directors...

01:45.839 --> 01:48.069
...is under indictment
and will be serving time."

01:48.241 --> 01:51.267
"I want you to have this job.
Of course, sodomy is a prerequisite."

01:51.444 --> 01:53.537
All right. All right.

01:53.713 --> 01:55.340
Why don't you just call him.

01:55.515 --> 01:58.780
He made a big deal about how
I understand everything immediately.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.214
That's what impressed him.

02:00.386 --> 02:03.355
So if you call to ask if you have
the job, you might lose it.

02:03.523 --> 02:07.619
-If I don't call...
-You have it, but you'll never know it.

02:07.794 --> 02:09.989
-What kind of company?
-Rest stop supply.

02:10.163 --> 02:12.859
Oh, good for you.

02:13.032 --> 02:14.499
-Yeah, yeah.
-Hey.

02:14.667 --> 02:16.134
-Hey.
-Hey.

02:16.302 --> 02:19.294
-Shower?
-Haircut. I'm very happy with this.

02:19.472 --> 02:21.235
-Who'd you use? Gino?
-Of course.

02:21.407 --> 02:23.898
-Wouldn't let that butcher cut my hair.
-What butcher?

02:24.077 --> 02:26.637
The uncle. Enzo.
That's the guy Jerry uses.

02:26.813 --> 02:30.146
I've been going to him for 12 years.
I can't switch. I'd hurt his feelings.

02:30.316 --> 02:33.149
-You never get good haircuts.
-You can get a good one today.

02:33.319 --> 02:36.516
It's Enzo's day off.
Gino's there all by himself.

02:36.689 --> 02:37.917
-Really?
-Yeah.

02:38.091 --> 02:41.060
You should go get one, to look good
for my bachelor auction.

02:41.227 --> 02:42.592
What bachelor auction?

02:42.762 --> 02:46.323
This thing where they auction
off dates with bachelors for charity.

02:46.499 --> 02:47.830
And you didn't ask me?

02:48.001 --> 02:50.663
I could raise enough money
to cure polio.

02:50.970 --> 02:53.370
They've had a cure for polio
for quite some time.

02:53.706 --> 02:55.173
Polio?

02:56.809 --> 03:00.040
Will you go ahead?
You need a haircut.

03:00.213 --> 03:01.510
-Okay.
-Yeah.

03:02.549 --> 03:04.710
-What are you all dressed up for?
-Job interview.

03:04.884 --> 03:07.114
-Yeah? How'd it go?
-Good.

03:07.287 --> 03:09.312
Of course...

03:15.695 --> 03:18.255
-Oh, Jerry!
-Hi, Enzo.

03:18.431 --> 03:20.865
-You come for the haircut?
-No.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.729
-Actually, I was...
-It's my day off.

03:22.902 --> 03:26.133
But I take care of you
because you my favorite customer.

03:26.306 --> 03:28.638
You been with me for so long.

03:28.808 --> 03:30.207
You so loyal.

03:30.843 --> 03:32.140
Well...

03:32.312 --> 03:34.644
-If it's your day off...
-What's the difference?

03:34.814 --> 03:37.544
-It takes 10 minutes.
-Well, it's...

03:39.919 --> 03:43.480
Jerry, today I'm gonna do
something special for you.

03:43.656 --> 03:47.057
-I don't wanna take too much off.
-Hey, who's your barber, huh?

03:47.227 --> 03:50.754
You tell the joke. I cut the hair.

03:51.931 --> 03:53.899
Gino, you've outdone yourself
this time.

03:54.067 --> 03:57.127
This is the best haircut
I've ever had.

03:59.000 --> 04:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:10.216 --> 04:13.083
-He massacred you!
-I know.

04:13.253 --> 04:15.153
You look like you're 5 years old.

04:17.290 --> 04:19.850
What if I shampoo?
Sometimes a shampoo helps.

04:20.026 --> 04:21.721
You gotta start seeing
somebody else.

04:21.894 --> 04:24.089
Get out of this relationship.

04:24.697 --> 04:27.564
I can't. He loves me.
He says I'm his most loyal customer.

04:27.734 --> 04:31.261
Plus, he's on the corner. I'd have
to pass him every day when I go by.

04:31.437 --> 04:35.100
-Well, you gotta do it.
-I can't, I can't. I'd break his heart.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.371
No way my Gino did that.

04:41.314 --> 04:44.613
-It's an Enzo.
-You told me he wouldn't be there.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.911
-So what?
-So I didn't wanna hurt his feelings.

04:47.086 --> 04:50.613
You can't continue seeing him.
You're destroying yourself.

04:53.259 --> 04:56.057
I'm not gonna let you.
Now, if you don't call him, I will.

04:56.229 --> 04:58.322
No, no, Kramer, you can't do that.

04:58.498 --> 05:01.729
I'll call Gino. You'll see him.
We're gonna get that haircut fixed.

05:01.901 --> 05:04.870
-I don't want you to call him.
-All right.

05:05.538 --> 05:07.301
You're crazy.

05:08.374 --> 05:10.934
So I still haven't heard
about that job.

05:11.110 --> 05:13.635
That's a tough one.
What are you gonna do about that?

05:13.980 --> 05:15.208
Well, I have an idea.

05:15.882 --> 05:18.817
-Yeah?
-I show up.

05:21.954 --> 05:24.445
-What do you mean, you show up?
-I show up.

05:24.624 --> 05:26.717
I pretend I have the job.

05:26.893 --> 05:30.056
The guy's on vacation.
If I have the job, it's fine.

05:30.229 --> 05:34.165
If I don't, by the time he comes back,
I'm ensconced.

05:36.202 --> 05:38.500
-Not bad.
-What's the worst that could happen?

05:38.671 --> 05:42.038
You'd be embarrassed and humiliated
in front of a large group of people...

05:42.208 --> 05:45.177
...and have to walk out in shame
with your tail between your legs.

05:46.145 --> 05:48.045
Yeah. So?

05:48.881 --> 05:52.510
Yeah. I see what you mean.
I forgot who I was dealing with.

05:54.821 --> 05:56.254
Good morning. Morning.

05:56.689 --> 05:58.418
Good morning.

05:58.591 --> 06:00.525
Morning. Hi. Nice to see you.
How are you?

06:00.693 --> 06:03.161
Good morning. Good morning.

06:03.663 --> 06:04.891
Good morning.

06:05.598 --> 06:08.226
-How can I help you?
-The name's George Costanza.

06:08.401 --> 06:11.666
I'm starting work here today.
I was wondering if you could...

06:11.838 --> 06:14.500
...tell me where my office is?
-I wasn't aware that...

06:14.674 --> 06:16.938
Mike. This is George Costanza.

06:17.110 --> 06:19.010
He's starting here today.

06:19.178 --> 06:20.736
Welcome aboard.

06:20.913 --> 06:22.540
Thanks, Mike. Nice to be aboard.

06:22.715 --> 06:25.115
I didn't know Mr. Tuttle
was finished interviewing.

06:25.284 --> 06:28.515
Oh, he was probably just
getting anxious to start his vacation.

06:30.223 --> 06:33.124
-He wants to know where his office is.
-Oh, well...

06:33.292 --> 06:34.759
Let's see. We've got two.

06:34.927 --> 06:37.657
There's the big one down the hall
and the small one here.

06:37.830 --> 06:40.230
-I should ask Jack.
-Oh, leave Jack alone.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.800
Jack's got enough problems.

06:42.969 --> 06:44.994
-I'll just take the small office.
-Really?

06:45.171 --> 06:46.798
Yes. I like to feel cozy.

06:46.973 --> 06:49.942
I have a small apartment.
I like to feel tucked in, nestled in.

06:50.109 --> 06:51.804
Love to be nestled.

06:51.978 --> 06:54.344
All right. It's 808, right down there.

06:54.514 --> 06:58.006
Meanwhile, I'll get you the Pensky file.
You can start working on that.

06:58.184 --> 07:00.118
Yes, of course. The Pensky file.

07:00.286 --> 07:02.846
Can't wait to sink my teeth into that.

07:03.022 --> 07:04.717
Wow, that Pensky.

07:04.891 --> 07:07.485
Well, we'll straighten him out.

07:52.104 --> 07:53.537
What do you do there all day?

07:54.273 --> 07:56.468
They gave me the Pensky file.

07:57.043 --> 08:00.240
-So it's a nice place to work?
-You know, I'm enjoying it very much.

08:00.413 --> 08:02.677
I think my coworkers
are really taking to me.

08:02.849 --> 08:04.339
We're like a family.

08:04.517 --> 08:07.509
<i>In fact, yesterday
was Grace's birthday.</i>

08:08.154 --> 08:09.985
<i>She's such a sweet woman.</i>

08:10.156 --> 08:14.092
<i>We had a little party
with cake and champagne.</i>

08:14.694 --> 08:16.321
<i>I made a toast.</i>

08:17.730 --> 08:19.994
What about your boss,
the guy who interviewed you?

08:20.433 --> 08:22.697
He'll be back on Monday.

08:24.136 --> 08:25.364
-Hi.
-Hey.

08:27.206 --> 08:28.901
How come you're wearing a hat?

08:29.642 --> 08:31.041
I got a haircut.

08:31.210 --> 08:33.337
Oh, yeah? Can I see it?

08:34.212 --> 08:35.510
There's nothing to see.

08:35.681 --> 08:37.706
-Come on. Let me see it.
-Forget it.

08:37.884 --> 08:40.352
Come on.

08:40.986 --> 08:42.544
All right.

09:03.476 --> 09:04.704
Very good. Thank you.

09:04.877 --> 09:06.538
I'm sorry.

09:06.712 --> 09:08.612
I'm sorry.

09:10.216 --> 09:12.844
You can forget about me going
to that bachelor auction.

09:13.052 --> 09:15.577
What? No, Jerry. You have to go.

09:15.755 --> 09:18.451
You know, Elaine, I'd do it,
but I'm working that day.

09:18.624 --> 09:20.990
Yeah. Too bad.

09:24.897 --> 09:28.196
This is the worst haircut
Jerry's ever had. You gotta fix it.

09:28.401 --> 09:30.164
Sure.

09:30.336 --> 09:33.396
I fix. But you gotta make sure
you no tell anybody.

09:34.140 --> 09:35.368
He's a little crazy.

09:35.541 --> 09:38.601
I don't know what he do
if he find out I touch Jerry's hair.

09:39.078 --> 09:41.512
So, I love that
<i>Edward Scissorhands</i>.

09:41.681 --> 09:43.342
That's the best movie I ever see.

09:44.317 --> 09:47.377
Again with the
<i>Edward Scissorhands</i>.

09:47.553 --> 09:49.987
How can you have a hand
like a scissor?

09:50.156 --> 09:52.454
Show me one person who's got
a hand like a scissor.

09:52.625 --> 09:55.788
Hey, it's a beautiful dream.
I love to be this man.

09:55.962 --> 10:00.922
Did you ever think about what
you're going to do on the toilet?

10:01.100 --> 10:04.194
What are you going to do
on the toilet?!

10:04.370 --> 10:07.134
I'd like to have shoehorn hands.

10:11.477 --> 10:12.705
-Hey.
-Hey.

10:12.878 --> 10:15.142
-Hey.
-Okay, now listen to me.

10:15.314 --> 10:17.441
I talked to Gino. He'll fix the haircut.

10:17.917 --> 10:20.283
Great. Then you can go
to the bachelor auction.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.011
-Yeah, but...
-No buts.

10:22.188 --> 10:24.554
His apartment tonight, 8:00.

10:24.724 --> 10:27.818
-Can he fix it?
-I don't know.

10:30.997 --> 10:35.730
Boy, you got a beautiful head of hair.

10:35.901 --> 10:37.129
Well, thank you.

10:37.303 --> 10:40.795
I bet Uncle Enzo,
he tell you that all the time.

10:40.973 --> 10:44.773
Actually, Enzo hasn't said that
to me in a while.

10:45.511 --> 10:50.210
I don't think Uncle Enzo realize
what a lucky barber he is.

10:50.383 --> 10:52.874
That's nice of you to say.

10:54.086 --> 10:55.553
Just a second.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.891
-Yes?
-<i>It's your Uncle Enzo.</i>

11:02.461 --> 11:05.555
It's Uncle Enzo! Quick.
Go in there. I'll clean up.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.162
Come on up.

11:23.616 --> 11:25.777
Uncle Enzo,
what are you doing here?

11:25.951 --> 11:28.886
-I come to apologize.
-Apologize?

11:29.055 --> 11:31.888
I rented the movie
<i>Edward Scissorhands</i>.

11:32.058 --> 11:34.526
That Johnny Depp, he make me cry.

11:35.728 --> 11:38.788
He make me cry too.
You want something to drink?

11:39.565 --> 11:42.830
Hey! What's all this?

11:43.769 --> 11:45.862
Nothing. It's just hair.

11:46.572 --> 11:49.700
-You do haircut in the apartment?
-No.

11:49.875 --> 11:52.867
Pizza man was here.
Maybe some fall off.

11:53.045 --> 11:55.036
He's going bald.

11:55.448 --> 11:58.110
It looks very familiar.

12:05.691 --> 12:08.558
In the one minute he worked on me,
I could tell he was good.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.628
Yeah. Slow, gentle, attentive.

12:10.796 --> 12:12.559
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

12:12.732 --> 12:16.168
-Didn't I tell you?
-But Enzo picked up one of my hairs.

12:16.335 --> 12:18.098
-Yeah? So?
-I think he knew.

12:18.270 --> 12:21.137
-No, he doesn't know.
-He knows my hair.

12:21.307 --> 12:23.434
You're imagining things.
He doesn't know a thing.

12:23.609 --> 12:27.238
-Come on. Pull yourself together.
-Okay, okay.

12:30.282 --> 12:31.943
What happened?
It looks the same.

12:32.118 --> 12:35.815
He didn't get to finish. His uncle
came in. We almost got caught!

12:37.223 --> 12:40.351
Jerry, the auction is in a few hours.

12:40.526 --> 12:42.756
-Take the K-Man.
-Yeah.

12:43.496 --> 12:45.327
You can still go.

12:45.765 --> 12:48.700
What, are you kidding?
Look at him. He's grotesque.

12:48.868 --> 12:51.837
-Do you think?
-Do I think? He's repugnant.

12:56.709 --> 13:00.167
-What would you wear?
-Whatever it takes.

13:03.048 --> 13:06.313
See, Newman is a good customer.

13:06.485 --> 13:10.979
Once I find a barber, I stick with him.
I almost went to barber school.

13:11.157 --> 13:13.352
I always felt I had a talent for it.

13:13.526 --> 13:16.188
Not everybody like Newman,
so loyal.

13:16.362 --> 13:19.058
Yeah, just the way that I was raised.

13:19.498 --> 13:21.466
I'm special.

13:22.201 --> 13:24.829
You know, I don't mind
if somebody's funny...

13:25.004 --> 13:28.201
...but I no like the funny business.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.878
I'm gonna go out for a little bit.

13:35.047 --> 13:38.210
-I'll be right back.
-Take your time.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.021
You happy with the haircut?

13:45.191 --> 13:48.126
It's okay. A little crooked.

13:48.894 --> 13:51.385
How you like to have a free haircut
for six months?

13:51.564 --> 13:55.625
-What's the catch?
-You get me a sample of Jerry's hair.

13:56.735 --> 13:58.999
That job sounds like
it might be worth...

13:59.171 --> 14:04.108
...a year's free haircuts.
And a comb.

14:11.917 --> 14:14.351
<i>Mr. Costanza,
Mr. Pensky's here to see you.</i>

14:19.491 --> 14:21.083
Mr. Pensky?

14:21.260 --> 14:22.591
Of the Pensky file?

14:22.761 --> 14:24.558
Costanza?

14:24.730 --> 14:26.129
Arthur Pensky.

14:26.298 --> 14:28.129
Mr. Pensky.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.803
I... I was just working on your file.

14:31.971 --> 14:33.199
I was...

14:33.372 --> 14:36.034
...transferring the contents
of the file into this...

14:36.208 --> 14:38.699
...flexible, accordion-style folder to...

14:38.878 --> 14:41.108
-Where's Tuttle?
-He's on vacation.

14:41.280 --> 14:45.114
He was on vacation the last time
I dropped by. Give me my file.

14:49.321 --> 14:51.346
Looks like you put
a lot of work into this.

14:52.024 --> 14:55.118
Well, in college they used to call me
"the little bulldog."

14:55.294 --> 14:58.695
Yeah, you are Pensky material.

14:58.864 --> 15:02.459
Would you ever consider
coming to work directly for me?

15:02.635 --> 15:04.967
-Really?
-You are aware...

15:05.137 --> 15:06.832
-<i>Mr. Costanza?</i>
-Not now, Clarisse.

15:07.006 --> 15:10.464
<i>I thought Mr. Pensky should know
they're towing his car.</i>

15:10.643 --> 15:12.110
Damn this city!

15:12.278 --> 15:14.803
I am aware..? I am aware..?

15:16.382 --> 15:18.475
He knows. He knows about us.

15:18.651 --> 15:20.243
-How do you know?
-Because I know.

15:20.419 --> 15:25.152
He's crazy. All morning, he looking
at the hair. He staring at the hair.

15:26.892 --> 15:28.917
-Who is it?
-It's Newman!

15:29.094 --> 15:31.756
He was in the shop with Enzo.
He can't see me here.

15:31.931 --> 15:35.458
Go in the bedroom. Open the window.
You can go out the fire escape.

15:39.805 --> 15:42.000
-What do you want?
-Could I use your bathroom?

15:43.475 --> 15:44.942
What's wrong with yours?

15:45.110 --> 15:47.101
-My toilet's clogged.
-You can't unclog it?

15:47.479 --> 15:48.810
-Did you ask Kramer?
-He's out.

15:48.981 --> 15:50.608
-Number one?
-Yes, yes.

15:51.283 --> 15:52.511
-May I go?
-Go ahead.

15:52.685 --> 15:54.585
-I gotta go very badly.
-Flush twice.

15:54.753 --> 15:56.482
Thank you!

16:00.526 --> 16:02.153
<i>No.</i>

16:02.328 --> 16:03.989
<i>Jackpot.</i>

16:05.030 --> 16:06.964
<i>I don't believe this.</i>

16:07.132 --> 16:08.861
<i>There's no hair in this thing.</i>

16:09.034 --> 16:13.471
<i>I've never seen a person that didn't
have at least one hair in a brush.</i>

16:14.807 --> 16:16.069
<i>Unbelievable.</i>

16:16.241 --> 16:17.868
<i>Nothing.</i>

16:29.054 --> 16:30.453
-All right?
-Yeah, yeah.

16:30.622 --> 16:32.817
-I'll see you later.
-What are you doing?

16:32.992 --> 16:34.721
I'm watching <i>Edward Scissorhands</i>.

16:35.661 --> 16:38.653
Could I watch a little?
It's my favorite movie.

16:39.398 --> 16:41.093
Yeah, all right.

16:45.771 --> 16:48.638
-You want something to drink?
-No, no.

16:56.949 --> 17:00.441
If you wanna watch, sit down.
You're making me nervous.

17:02.855 --> 17:06.723
I tell you, this Scissorhands
is a hell of a barber.

17:06.892 --> 17:08.826
Gotta go.

17:09.094 --> 17:11.756
Oh, I dropped a nickel.

17:12.564 --> 17:14.224
Yeah.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.334
See you, Jerry.

17:30.582 --> 17:32.447
Did you get it?

17:37.322 --> 17:40.257
Oh, you done good, Newman.

17:40.426 --> 17:42.417
It was a cinch.

17:42.594 --> 17:43.652
Where you going?

17:55.074 --> 17:58.202
Nine hundred!
Do I hear 1000?

17:58.377 --> 18:02.609
Ladies, he is a Harvard graduate.

18:02.781 --> 18:05.978
-A thousand.
-A thousand. Okay, a thousand once.

18:06.151 --> 18:07.482
A thousand twice.

18:07.653 --> 18:09.746
A thousand three times.
Sold...

18:09.922 --> 18:12.720
...to the lucky lady in the third row.

18:12.891 --> 18:15.758
Congratulations.
Thank you so much.

18:16.495 --> 18:19.828
Okay, our next bachelor is number...

18:19.998 --> 18:22.865
...124 on your program.

18:23.035 --> 18:24.525
He...

18:26.305 --> 18:27.932
He is...

18:28.107 --> 18:29.972
He's a high school graduate.

18:30.142 --> 18:32.076
Equi...

18:33.345 --> 18:35.370
Equivalency.

18:35.547 --> 18:38.277
A high school equivalency
program graduate.

18:39.284 --> 18:40.683
He's...

18:40.853 --> 18:43.083
...self-employed.

18:43.255 --> 18:44.688
He's...

18:44.857 --> 18:49.487
...I don't know, 6'3", 190 pounds.

18:50.095 --> 18:52.359
He likes...

18:52.931 --> 18:54.865
...fruit.

18:55.300 --> 18:58.201
And he just got a haircut.

19:00.239 --> 19:01.433
Kramer!

19:01.640 --> 19:03.130
Kramer!

19:04.076 --> 19:06.271
Okay, why don't we start
the bidding.

19:07.746 --> 19:10.146
Do I hear 5 bucks?

19:12.351 --> 19:16.515
I don't get this Scissorhands. Is he
a superhero? Like Green Lantern?

19:16.688 --> 19:18.019
What's with this guy?

19:20.058 --> 19:21.923
I'm just asking.

19:23.462 --> 19:25.862
-Who is it?
-Enzo Manganero!

19:26.031 --> 19:27.999
Oh, my God!

19:28.767 --> 19:32.396
One second!
Go. Go in the bedroom.

19:39.411 --> 19:42.437
It was you that was at Gino's
apartment the other night!

19:42.614 --> 19:45.310
-No, I wasn't there.
-Don't lie!

19:45.484 --> 19:46.883
I know it was you!

19:47.052 --> 19:49.543
I get a sample of your hair.
I match them up.

19:49.721 --> 19:51.279
Sample?

19:51.456 --> 19:53.185
Newman.

19:55.060 --> 19:57.790
I was there, but I was just
dropping off a book.

19:57.963 --> 19:59.191
Don't, Jerry.

19:59.364 --> 20:01.594
So, it's true!

20:01.767 --> 20:03.598
Yes.

20:03.769 --> 20:05.600
Is true.

20:06.138 --> 20:09.073
I'm gonna kill the both of you!

20:23.755 --> 20:25.916
Mr. Tuttle! You're back.

20:26.525 --> 20:27.992
George.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.219
I'm surprised to find you here.

20:30.729 --> 20:34.221
-You are?
-I thought you'd take the larger office.

20:36.668 --> 20:37.896
Really?

20:38.070 --> 20:40.231
I guess I didn't make it clear
when I hired you.

20:41.440 --> 20:43.965
So where's that Pensky file?

20:44.543 --> 20:46.511
Let's see what you've been
up to all week.

20:46.678 --> 20:47.906
Here it is.

20:54.353 --> 20:55.911
What have you been
doing all week?

20:56.088 --> 20:58.318
You missed a lovely party for Grace.

20:58.490 --> 21:00.481
You haven't done anything with this.

21:01.226 --> 21:04.195
Well, bear in mind,
I am in the smaller office.

21:05.664 --> 21:08.827
I'm beginning to wonder
if you understand anything.

21:09.001 --> 21:12.664
You are aware that Pensky
is interested in me.

21:13.472 --> 21:15.201
You're not Pensky material.

21:15.941 --> 21:20.776
Really? Well, we'll just
see about that.

21:20.946 --> 21:24.347
Ta-ta, Tuttle.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.700
Jerry.

22:04.056 --> 22:07.924
George, I'm sorry I gave you
the wrong impression.

22:08.093 --> 22:09.924
What I was gonna say was:

22:10.095 --> 22:15.499
Now, you are aware that our
board of directors has been indicted...

22:15.667 --> 22:17.066
...myself included.

22:18.170 --> 22:22.869
We're prohibited from doing business
until the investigation is completed.

22:23.041 --> 22:24.872
So obviously...

22:25.043 --> 22:26.874
...we would have no use for you.

22:27.679 --> 22:29.044
Obviously.

22:30.382 --> 22:34.284
-Yes?
-<i>Mr. Costanza's car is being towed.</i>

22:43.762 --> 22:45.491
So when are you gonna
be able to go out?

22:45.731 --> 22:47.164
Not for a while.
