Optimus: And it was written
in the covenant of Primus

00:05.121 --> 00:11.025
that when the 47 spheres align,
a perpetual conflict will culminate

00:11.027 --> 00:18.066
upon a world forged from chaos,
and the weak shall perish

00:18.068 --> 00:21.669
in the shadow
of a rising darkness.

00:21.671 --> 00:23.805
No skies raining fire?

00:23.807 --> 00:25.540
Goes without saying.

00:25.542 --> 00:27.909
It is a doom prophecy, after all.

00:27.911 --> 00:29.944
I say it's a load of hooey.

00:29.946 --> 00:33.147
I'd always assumed the ancients
were referring to our home planet,

00:33.149 --> 00:36.050
but being that Cybertron
has been dark for eons...

00:36.052 --> 00:39.153
Optimus: And considering
what has befallen this planet

00:39.155 --> 00:41.189
since Megatron's arrival here...

00:41.191 --> 00:42.957
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:42.959 --> 00:45.226
We've known about
these superstitions for ages

00:45.228 --> 00:47.128
and never gave them
a second thought.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.896
Why all the ominous
rumblings now?

00:48.898 --> 00:53.000
Because the planetary alignment
to which the prophecy refers

00:53.002 --> 00:54.769
is nearly upon us.

00:54.771 --> 00:59.741
And it would seem
its end point...Is earth.

00:59.743 --> 01:03.911
Uh...Crazy coincidence,
heh, r-right?

01:03.913 --> 01:06.047
How long are we talking?

01:06.049 --> 01:08.649
A few days at most.

01:10.352 --> 01:13.221
However unsettling
this revelation may be,

01:13.223 --> 01:16.491
I am more concerned about those
who might believe

01:16.493 --> 01:20.795
That the prophecy
speaks to them alone.

01:20.797 --> 01:23.865
I did not seek out
the blood of Unicron

01:23.867 --> 01:26.401
To simply keep my spark aflame,

01:26.403 --> 01:29.871
but to rule undead armies
and conquer worlds,

01:29.873 --> 01:31.639
and to accomplish that,

01:31.641 --> 01:34.375
I require more
than this mere sliver

01:34.377 --> 01:36.177
which lies within me.

01:36.179 --> 01:40.014
So, where is my Dark Energon?!

01:40.016 --> 01:41.983
Out there, lord Megatron,

01:41.985 --> 01:44.685
just waiting for you
to reach out and pluck it.

01:46.021 --> 01:48.623
But you shouldn't
push yourself so hard.

01:48.625 --> 01:51.259
You've had setbacks.
You were in stasis.

01:51.261 --> 01:52.427
Oh!

01:52.429 --> 01:55.563
Precisely why I must
make up for lost time!

01:55.565 --> 01:58.166
I can see the future vividly,

01:58.168 --> 02:00.868
but I must ensure its outcome,

02:00.870 --> 02:06.574
for I am the rising darkness
of which the prophecy speaks!

He's going to the 
emergency room.

15:04.034 --> 15:07.068
Nurse Darby, your doctors
won't be able to comprehend

15:07.070 --> 15:10.772
what's afflicting him --
not without a decade of study.

15:10.774 --> 15:12.774
I don't have time to argue.

15:12.776 --> 15:15.310
The effects of an energon blast
on an autobot

15:15.312 --> 15:18.813
can be devastating enough,
but this is a human.

15:18.815 --> 15:20.882
I'm not getting any readings.

15:20.884 --> 15:22.784
How could I not have seen this?

15:22.786 --> 15:27.288
Rafael's been infected
with Dark Energon.

15:35.898 --> 15:39.701
Megatron, today you answer
for your crimes

15:39.703 --> 15:43.871
against Cybertron
and against humanity.

15:43.873 --> 15:45.873
One shall stand...

15:45.875 --> 15:48.276
And one shall fall --

15:48.278 --> 15:51.179
You, Optimus Prime!

15:51.181 --> 15:53.214
[ both grunting ]

15:56.385 --> 15:59.821
If Dark Energon is devouring
Raf from the inside out,

15:59.823 --> 16:04.459
we must expel it and fast,
the only possible way I know.

16:04.461 --> 16:06.261
I need Energon.

16:06.263 --> 16:07.362
Wait.

16:07.364 --> 16:10.298
You said Energon
was devastating to humans.

16:10.300 --> 16:12.333
Under normal circumstances,
quite.

16:12.335 --> 16:14.502
But I am relying upon
the dark matter

16:14.504 --> 16:18.339
currently invading Rafael's body
to meet it head on.

16:29.118 --> 16:30.118
Yah!

16:49.738 --> 16:52.974
Your defeat here was 
foreseen by the ancients.

16:52.976 --> 16:56.311
What was it they wrote --
"the weak shall perish"?

16:56.313 --> 16:59.347
Do not believe
everything you read.

17:04.420 --> 17:06.421
[ rapid beeping ]

17:09.391 --> 17:12.960
I need him over here now!

17:15.464 --> 17:17.498
[ steady beeping ]

17:19.734 --> 17:22.670
[ whirring ]

17:33.649 --> 17:35.616
[ beeping ]

17:49.698 --> 17:52.934
Raf: [ sighs ]
Pulse rate is stabilizing.

17:52.936 --> 17:55.069
[ weakly ] bee.

17:55.071 --> 17:56.604
[ buzzes ]

17:56.606 --> 17:58.039
Ah.

18:03.212 --> 18:05.980
Optimus, we did it.

18:05.982 --> 18:07.348
[ roars ]

18:14.323 --> 18:15.490
Aah!

18:24.133 --> 18:25.700
Aah!

18:27.269 --> 18:29.937
Yahh!

18:29.939 --> 18:31.406
[ tires screeching ]

18:54.096 --> 18:55.530
Yah!

18:59.134 --> 19:01.469
[ panting ]

19:06.608 --> 19:09.310
My destiny!

19:10.312 --> 19:13.548
This isn't how it's 
supposed to end!

19:13.550 --> 19:17.919
On the contrary, Megatron.

19:20.322 --> 19:24.258
I could not have allowed
this to end otherwise.

19:41.343 --> 19:44.011
Bulkhead, you let Optimus
face Megatron alone?

19:44.013 --> 19:45.646
I didn't have a choice.

19:45.648 --> 19:47.081
It could be a trap.

19:47.083 --> 19:49.150
We need to get a fix
on his location.

19:51.186 --> 19:53.254
[ growls ]

19:57.693 --> 20:00.194
How was it that you put it,
Optimus?

20:00.196 --> 20:03.431
"I could not have allowed
this to end otherwise"?

20:16.411 --> 20:18.746
Aaaaah!

20:35.097 --> 20:37.398
[ grunts ]

20:41.069 --> 20:43.070
I'm locked onto
Optimus' signal.

20:43.072 --> 20:44.839
Wait.

20:44.841 --> 20:46.574
How is this possible?

20:46.576 --> 20:48.042
What? What is it?

20:48.044 --> 20:52.179
We need to get Optimus
out of there now!

20:57.886 --> 21:00.821
[ laughs ]

21:00.823 --> 21:02.857
Well, well.

21:02.859 --> 21:06.460
It seem the blood
of Unicron I've been seeking

21:06.462 --> 21:11.399
is not out there,
but rather... right here.

21:11.401 --> 21:15.336
Dark Energon erupting
from the earth...?

21:23.392 --> 21:26.824
