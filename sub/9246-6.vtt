WEBVTT

00:02.567 --> 00:05.092
- 'Molly, you comin' to bed?'
- In a minute!

00:05.179 --> 00:06.876
[Mike]
'You said that ten minutes ago.'

00:06.963 --> 00:09.313
I know, I'm sorry.
Let me just finish this chapter.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.098
'Oh, how long you gonna be?'

00:11.185 --> 00:12.882
[Joyce]
'Just go down
and do her on the couch!'

00:12.969 --> 00:14.057
Mom!

00:15.754 --> 00:18.409
So, what do you think?

00:18.496 --> 00:20.759
No, I'm not doing it
on the couch.

00:20.846 --> 00:23.501
Apparently, we're not doing it
anywhere anymore.

00:23.588 --> 00:25.503
Look, if I'm gonna get
this vice-principal job

00:25.590 --> 00:26.983
and make a difference
at the school

00:27.070 --> 00:28.898
I'm gonna have to put in
some extra time.

00:28.985 --> 00:30.813
Oh, I get wanting to
fight the system.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.554
In junior high,
I spearheaded a petition

00:32.641 --> 00:35.209
to revoke
the four-milk limit.

00:35.296 --> 00:36.819
How did that work out for you?

00:36.906 --> 00:38.603
They buried me
in a sea of red tape.

00:40.605 --> 00:42.085
Sweetie, I'm sorry
I haven't given you

00:42.172 --> 00:44.914
a lot of attention lately,
but this is important to me.

00:45.001 --> 00:46.959
I understand, I'll let you
get back to your work

00:47.047 --> 00:48.787
and I'll see you in the morning.

00:50.267 --> 00:51.790
- Hang on.
- Yes?

00:53.792 --> 00:55.490
I'll go upstairs
with you for a while

00:55.577 --> 00:57.492
but then I gotta come back down
and finish my work.

00:57.579 --> 00:59.320
So you're gonna have sex with me
just to shut me up?

00:59.407 --> 01:01.235
No, not just to shut you up.

01:01.322 --> 01:04.803
Just to put you to sleep,
and so you won't talk anymore.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.633
Hang on a second.
Have you done this before?

01:08.720 --> 01:11.332
Not intentionally.

01:11.419 --> 01:14.639
No, I'm not that desperate.
You go ahead and study.

01:14.726 --> 01:17.990
If your heart's not in it 100%,
I'm not gonna enjoy it either.

01:18.078 --> 01:20.036
- Okay.
- Goodnight.

01:20.123 --> 01:21.429
Goodnight.

01:27.087 --> 01:30.002
You know,
I don't really need a 100%.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.830
You know, what's passing?
Like, 70, right?

01:31.917 --> 01:33.745
Can you at least give me 70?

01:33.832 --> 01:34.920
Seventy I could do.

01:36.574 --> 01:40.883
♪ For the first time
in my life ♪

01:41.884 --> 01:45.757
♪ I see love ♪♪

01:56.638 --> 01:58.640
I'm telling you,
if we pick the right costumes

01:58.727 --> 02:00.598
this Halloween, we can both
get lucky with the ladies.

02:00.685 --> 02:02.078
I'm listening.

02:02.165 --> 02:03.906
The key is,
we both can't be dressed sexy

02:03.993 --> 02:05.386
'cause that puts off a gay vibe,
and the chicks

02:05.473 --> 02:06.996
will think we're a couple.

02:08.693 --> 02:10.782
We should avoid that
if possible.

02:10.869 --> 02:12.132
Indeed, we should.

02:12.219 --> 02:13.698
So, one of us
needs to dress sexy

02:13.785 --> 02:15.047
while the other one
dresses cute.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.701
That way, the cute guy
earns their trust

02:16.788 --> 02:18.399
while the sexy guy
closes the deal.

02:18.486 --> 02:21.097
Here we go.

02:21.184 --> 02:24.361
For example, I could dress up
as the dashing Spaniard, Zorro

02:24.448 --> 02:26.929
and you could be my little
sidekick, SpongeBob SquarePants.

02:29.453 --> 02:31.542
- Why can't I be Zorro?
- Do you have a Zorro costume?

02:31.629 --> 02:34.502
- No.
- Well, I do.

02:34.589 --> 02:37.069
I also have a SpongeBob costume
that this one would never wear.

02:38.593 --> 02:39.942
Samuel, don't do this.

02:40.029 --> 02:41.422
He just wants you
to look like an idiot

02:41.509 --> 02:43.206
so he can increase his odds.

02:43.293 --> 02:44.860
Thank you, Mike,
I was unable to see through

02:44.947 --> 02:47.036
Carl's clever machinations.

02:48.559 --> 02:50.039
You're still pissed about that
me Tarzan

02:50.126 --> 02:51.606
you Humpty Dumpty debacle?

02:51.693 --> 02:53.564
Yeah, me still pissed.

02:55.262 --> 02:57.220
It was the most humiliating
night of my life.

02:57.307 --> 02:59.353
Hey, that's not on me, you're
the one who spent all night

02:59.440 --> 03:03.444
bellyaching and pouring Tequila
shots into your egg-hole.

03:03.531 --> 03:05.707
I sat on a barstool
for three hours

03:05.794 --> 03:09.406
while people kept trying to
push me over.

03:09.493 --> 03:11.060
You know how hard it is
to defend yourself

03:11.147 --> 03:13.976
when you're dressed as an egg?

03:14.063 --> 03:15.325
No, but I know how funny it is.

03:15.412 --> 03:16.935
Ah.

03:17.022 --> 03:18.241
Some drunk guy
wearing a chicken suit

03:18.328 --> 03:20.200
kept trying to sit on his face.

03:21.940 --> 03:23.594
Halloween is a stupid holiday.

03:23.681 --> 03:26.162
Even as a kid, no matter
how cool my costume was

03:26.249 --> 03:28.773
I was always the fat cowboy
or fat Superman.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.166
I dressed as Dracula once

03:30.253 --> 03:32.386
and everybody thought
I was Pavarotti.

03:34.649 --> 03:36.564
I do agree,
it's a very odd ritual.

03:36.651 --> 03:38.000
Children walking door-to-door

03:38.087 --> 03:40.350
holding out empty sacks,
begging for food.

03:40.437 --> 03:43.701
In my country, that's not called
Halloween, it's called Tuesday.

03:45.529 --> 03:47.096
First of all,
the common misconception

03:47.183 --> 03:48.706
is that it's a holiday
for children.

03:48.793 --> 03:51.405
In fact, it is an excuse
for grown women to dress slutty

03:51.492 --> 03:54.451
get crazy drunk
and make bad decisions.

03:54.538 --> 03:56.801
Like going home
with the Zorro and SpongeBob?

03:58.977 --> 04:00.892
Yeah, well, make sure you got
enough money for cab fare

04:00.979 --> 04:02.981
when Zorro here ditches you
for two girls

04:03.068 --> 04:05.549
dressed like a good witch
and a bad witch.

04:05.636 --> 04:07.290
That was a weird night.

04:07.377 --> 04:08.813
It turns out the good witch
was actually the bad witch

04:08.900 --> 04:12.077
and the bad witch
was actually a dude.

04:12.164 --> 04:15.124
Meanwhile, I was at the IHOP
dressed as an egg

04:15.211 --> 04:17.257
having pancakes with a chicken.

04:21.957 --> 04:24.264
So Molly's working late again
tonight, huh?

04:24.351 --> 04:27.441
Yeah. She's really shooting
for that vice-principal job.

04:27.528 --> 04:29.704
Vice-principal, huh?

04:29.791 --> 04:32.272
Kind of a butch job
for a broad, isn't it?

04:34.056 --> 04:35.275
What are you talking about?

04:35.362 --> 04:36.841
Well, in my day,
the vice-principal

04:36.928 --> 04:38.887
was a hairy goon
that slapped you around

04:38.974 --> 04:42.020
for taking a girl's cherry
in the gym teacher's skylark.

04:45.328 --> 04:48.288
You understand she works
at an elementary school, right?

04:49.550 --> 04:50.507
Absolutely.

04:50.594 --> 04:51.856
If it was junior high

04:51.943 --> 04:54.685
they'd kneecap you
with a phone book.

04:54.772 --> 04:56.687
Well, I think most schools
now have really

04:56.774 --> 04:58.733
cut back on the physical abuse.

04:58.820 --> 05:00.256
And that's the reason
we're all gonna be

05:00.343 --> 05:03.303
speaking Chinese in ten years.

05:03.390 --> 05:05.217
I think nowadays
the vice-principal job's

05:05.305 --> 05:09.265
mostly administrative and not
so much about skull-cracking.

05:09.352 --> 05:11.528
Well, goodbye, America.

05:13.530 --> 05:16.577
I hope you don't mind
rickshaws in the carpool lane.

05:18.361 --> 05:19.928
I'm actually
very proud of Molly.

05:20.015 --> 05:21.451
Instead of just gripin'
about the problem

05:21.538 --> 05:22.713
she's trying to fix it.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.933
Oh, one of those, huh?

05:25.020 --> 05:27.196
Well, you're a better man
than me, my friend.

05:27.283 --> 05:28.980
I wouldn't be able
to take a back seat

05:29.067 --> 05:30.417
to my old lady's career.

05:30.504 --> 05:32.157
It's not about
taking a back seat.

05:32.244 --> 05:34.159
I'm just trying to be
supportive of my partner.

05:34.246 --> 05:35.944
And I admire that.

05:36.031 --> 05:38.686
I guess I'm not man enough
to be as womanly as you are.

05:41.079 --> 05:43.604
You know, Vince, I'd ask you
to come join me in this century

05:43.691 --> 05:47.303
but you don't seem all that
comfortable in the last one.

05:47.390 --> 05:49.914
Call me old-fashioned,
but unlike a suit

05:50.001 --> 05:52.569
a relationship does not come
with two pairs of pants.

05:54.136 --> 05:57.313
Hey, I just remembered
I have a TV in my room.

05:57.400 --> 06:00.055
Aw, come on.
I hurt your feelings?

06:00.142 --> 06:03.101
You know, sometimes
you're kind of a big girl.

06:03.188 --> 06:05.669
Yeah, well, this big girl
has a gun in her room.

06:08.890 --> 06:11.588
Son of a bitch
always has to play that card.

06:19.117 --> 06:21.555
Mike? Sweetheart, you awake?

06:21.642 --> 06:23.731
Mike, guess what happened.

06:23.818 --> 06:26.081
- What time is it?
- It's really late. Super late.

06:26.168 --> 06:28.344
The committee meeting went long,
and we all went out

06:28.431 --> 06:30.172
for coffee afterwards,
and I asked for decaf

06:30.259 --> 06:32.957
but I don't think
they gave me decaf.

06:33.044 --> 06:34.219
O-okay.

06:34.306 --> 06:36.091
Uh, no, no, no, no,
I have great news.

06:36.178 --> 06:38.093
Really great news.
You want to hear it?

06:38.180 --> 06:39.703
Do you want to hear it?
Do you want to hear it?

06:39.790 --> 06:42.271
[sighs]
Geez, how much coffee
did you have?

06:42.358 --> 06:43.272
I don't know,
but I'm sweating bullets

06:43.359 --> 06:44.491
and I've peed five times.

06:44.578 --> 06:46.231
- Alright.
- No, hey, hey, hey!

06:46.318 --> 06:49.104
Anyway, the principal dropped
by the committee meeting

06:49.191 --> 06:50.671
and he told me
that he was really impressed

06:50.758 --> 06:52.934
with all the extra hours
I've been putting in.

06:53.021 --> 06:54.109
- Uh-huh.
- 'Yeah.'

06:54.196 --> 06:55.197
But here's the best part.

06:55.284 --> 06:56.198
You want to hear the best part?

06:56.285 --> 06:58.374
If it's the last part.

06:58.461 --> 07:00.681
Guess who's been invited
to his house

07:00.768 --> 07:02.987
for a very exclusive
Halloween party?

07:03.074 --> 07:04.467
- You?
- No, us!

07:04.554 --> 07:06.991
- Crap. Crap.
- No, no, no!

07:07.078 --> 07:08.863
Come on,
I know you hate Halloween

07:08.950 --> 07:10.821
but I'll buy us cool costumes.

07:10.908 --> 07:12.301
How do you feel
about playing Dracula?

07:12.388 --> 07:15.260
No!
I don't want to wear a costume!

07:15.347 --> 07:18.438
Well, neither do I,
but it's a great opportunity

07:18.525 --> 07:21.005
for me to schmooze with the
members of the school board.

07:21.092 --> 07:24.444
Oh, wow, you put off a lot
of heat when you sleep.

07:24.531 --> 07:25.445
Ah.

07:28.056 --> 07:30.667
Molly,
please don't make me do this.

07:30.754 --> 07:32.495
Okay, fine.

07:32.582 --> 07:34.976
I'm not gonna
make you do anything

07:35.063 --> 07:37.239
but I bet I could persuade you.

07:39.154 --> 07:40.938
Oh, wait a second,
you're gonna have sex with me

07:41.025 --> 07:42.636
just to get me to do somethin'
I don't want to do?

07:42.723 --> 07:44.507
- Is there a problem?
- No.

07:44.594 --> 07:45.900
Oh.

07:47.510 --> 07:50.644
Oh...how about if we go
as raggedy Ann and Andy?

07:50.731 --> 07:52.384
Oh!

07:52.472 --> 07:53.995
- Don't talk.
- Oh.

08:03.700 --> 08:06.703
I hate Halloween.

08:06.790 --> 08:09.314
Come on.
It's just kids being kids.

08:09.401 --> 08:10.664
You don't want to know
what I threw at cop cars

08:10.751 --> 08:11.795
when I was their age.

08:11.882 --> 08:13.057
It's not that,
I gotta go to this

08:13.144 --> 08:15.407
stupid costume party
with Molly tonight.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.409
Aw, that's too bad.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.195
Sandwich bags filled
with poop, by the way.

08:20.282 --> 08:22.937
Yeah, I figured as much.

08:23.024 --> 08:24.808
You know what she did last night
to get me to go?

08:24.895 --> 08:27.463
She woke me up out of a dead
sleep and had sex with me.

08:27.550 --> 08:30.597
I'm listening really hard,
but I'm not hearing the bad.

08:30.684 --> 08:32.729
She knows I can't say no
to intercourse

08:32.816 --> 08:34.731
and she used that
to her advantage.

08:34.818 --> 08:37.473
Wait, so you're saying women
use sex to get us to do things

08:37.560 --> 08:39.214
we wouldn't normally do?

08:39.301 --> 08:41.303
We'd better warn the others!

08:41.390 --> 08:43.131
Hey, it's new to me.

08:47.527 --> 08:49.964
That's it! Let's scare the hell
out of those little punks.

08:50.051 --> 08:51.705
Alright. If we have to chase 'em
on foot, I'll go after the hulk

08:51.792 --> 08:53.794
and you go
after the giant hotdog.

08:53.881 --> 08:56.536
You know what's weird?
I had a dream about that once.

09:00.104 --> 09:01.845
I'll give you the black lipstick

09:01.932 --> 09:04.848
so you can reapply it
after you make out or throw up.

09:04.935 --> 09:07.372
I'm not gonna be making out
or throwing up.

09:07.459 --> 09:10.506
I thought you said
it was a party.

09:10.593 --> 09:11.942
Let me get some more hairspray

09:12.029 --> 09:13.683
so it doesn't wilt
while you're dancing.

09:13.770 --> 09:16.033
There's not gonna be
any dancing.

09:16.120 --> 09:19.384
Wow, no dancing,
throwing up or making out?

09:19.471 --> 09:22.170
Sometimes I do all that stuff
on the way to the party.

09:24.259 --> 09:27.784
Mike, you're late.
What happened?

09:27.871 --> 09:29.743
Carl and I ran into
a pack of ten-year-olds

09:29.830 --> 09:33.050
armed with eggs
and wired on sweet tarts.

09:33.137 --> 09:35.052
You can't use excessive force
on them, can you?

09:35.139 --> 09:37.838
Uh, you can, but everybody
has video cameras now.

09:40.101 --> 09:41.885
Well, we need to get dressed.

09:41.972 --> 09:45.367
And as you can see, I'm going
as bride of Frankenstein

09:45.454 --> 09:46.803
which means you will be..

09:46.890 --> 09:48.544
Fat Frankenstein.

09:48.631 --> 09:50.677
You know what? I'm not doing it.
I'm not gonna dress up.

09:50.764 --> 09:52.113
You have to,
it's a Halloween party.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.897
Everybody is gonna be
dressed up.

09:53.984 --> 09:56.378
Listen, I understand that
this night is important to you

09:56.465 --> 09:58.554
and I will happily stand
by your side

09:58.641 --> 10:00.817
all night long
in the nicest suit I own

10:00.904 --> 10:04.212
but I will not, I repeat,
will not put on a stupid costume

10:04.299 --> 10:06.780
just to be a part of your
blind quest for power!

10:14.875 --> 10:16.746
[growls]

10:16.833 --> 10:19.401
- Quit growling.
- I hate this.

10:19.488 --> 10:22.360
The sleeves are too short,
my pants are riding up on me

10:22.447 --> 10:24.928
and I can't take a whizz
without turning my penis green.

10:35.504 --> 10:36.505
[doorbell rings]

10:36.592 --> 10:38.159
Oh. Grab that, will you, Vin?

10:38.246 --> 10:41.118
I'm making us
some candy corn tinis.

10:44.339 --> 10:46.210
Hold on, you little bastards.

10:50.345 --> 10:51.825
[all]
Trick-or-treat!

10:51.912 --> 10:53.696
Yeah, yeah, don't lean
on the bell like that.

10:53.783 --> 10:56.046
What are you, diabetic?

10:56.133 --> 10:57.918
No, I'm Batman.

10:58.005 --> 11:00.834
Well, I'm Satan.
Welcome to hell.

11:00.921 --> 11:03.967
One for you,
one for the little lady

11:04.054 --> 11:06.317
and one for four-eyes
over here.

11:06.404 --> 11:07.797
I'm Harry Potter.

11:07.884 --> 11:09.886
A little advice,
lose the broom

11:09.973 --> 11:12.149
and get a strong male influence
in your life.

11:17.894 --> 11:19.853
Well, they're just adorable,
aren't they?

11:19.940 --> 11:22.203
Oh, yeah, I can't wait
for Mike and Molly

11:22.290 --> 11:24.553
to give us some grandkids.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.511
Well, you're so good with them.

11:34.041 --> 11:36.391
Ah, ooh, isn't this great?

11:36.478 --> 11:38.175
[growling]

11:38.262 --> 11:39.786
Stop growling.

11:39.873 --> 11:41.788
I hate Halloween,
I hate Halloween costumes

11:41.875 --> 11:43.441
and I hate Halloween parties.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.356
Yeah, but look,
there's people walking around

11:45.443 --> 11:47.532
with trays of little food.
You like that.

11:47.619 --> 11:50.057
I do like that.

11:50.144 --> 11:51.798
Ms. Flynn,
glad you could make it.

11:51.885 --> 11:54.539
Hi, Principal Gilmartin,
thank you so much

11:54.626 --> 11:56.890
for inviting us
to your beautiful home.

11:56.977 --> 11:59.588
And this is my fiance,
Michael Biggs

11:59.675 --> 12:01.329
of the Chicago
Police Department.

12:01.416 --> 12:03.505
Arrgh, 'tis a pleasure
to meet you, matey.

12:05.420 --> 12:06.987
[chuckles]

12:07.074 --> 12:09.990
Mike, he is not a pirate,
he's Edgar Allen Poe.

12:10.077 --> 12:13.558
That's why he's got a raven on
his shoulder and not a parrot.

12:13.645 --> 12:15.517
Where'd they get that
brain of yours from?

12:15.604 --> 12:16.997
[both laughing]

12:17.084 --> 12:18.955
I don't know,
you rented the costume.

12:20.914 --> 12:23.177
Well, it's nice to meet you,
Officer Biggs.

12:23.264 --> 12:25.788
Or should I say Mr.
and Mrs. Frankenstein?

12:25.875 --> 12:27.747
[both laughing]

12:30.314 --> 12:31.359
What'd I miss?

12:33.187 --> 12:36.146
Oh, Molly, there's a couple
of folks from the school board.

12:36.233 --> 12:38.409
- I'd like to introduce you to.
- Oh, right behind you.

12:38.496 --> 12:40.672
- U-uh, you gonna be okay?
- Yeah, I'll be fine.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.544
I'll just grab a couple
of those little sandwiches

12:42.631 --> 12:43.545
and hang out
with Shemp over there.

12:43.632 --> 12:45.286
That's Gertrude Stein.

12:45.373 --> 12:47.679
Well, she did a great job
with the Shemp costume.

12:50.334 --> 12:52.206
Eh, a wise guy.

13:01.171 --> 13:03.043
There you go.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.088
[sighs]

13:08.657 --> 13:11.355
Do I look like
I'm from outer space?

13:11.442 --> 13:13.793
Whoa, Manny, Moe and Jack.

13:15.925 --> 13:17.927
Can you tell
which one's the fake one?

13:18.014 --> 13:20.103
No.
And I'm really looking.

13:21.931 --> 13:23.280
Baby, you sure
you're ready for a night

13:23.367 --> 13:25.239
of guys eyeballing your honkers?

13:25.326 --> 13:28.242
Business as usual, really.

13:28.329 --> 13:32.594
But now I get to say,
hey, my three eyes are up here.

13:32.681 --> 13:34.552
Hey, look at that,
you do have three eyes.

13:35.466 --> 13:36.424
[doorbell ringing]

13:36.511 --> 13:38.687
Vince, get the door.

13:40.210 --> 13:42.734
I'm gonna have to sleep
on my back tonight.

13:46.303 --> 13:47.739
Ah, you gotta be kiddin' me.

13:47.827 --> 13:48.915
You guys are a little old to be

13:49.002 --> 13:50.133
trick-or-treatin', aren't you?

13:50.220 --> 13:52.396
Just give us the candy, man.

13:52.483 --> 13:54.224
What are you, like 30?

13:56.531 --> 13:58.838
Get a job and buy your own.

14:00.317 --> 14:01.797
Just give 'em the candy, Vince.

14:01.884 --> 14:04.408
Yeah, just give us the candy,
Vince.

14:04.495 --> 14:06.628
No.
There's a principle involved.

14:06.715 --> 14:09.413
These mopes didn't even say
trick-or-treat.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.763
Trick-or-treat, okay?

14:11.851 --> 14:13.069
Come on,
just give 'em the candy.

14:13.156 --> 14:15.898
Otherwise,
they'll crap on the lawn.

14:15.985 --> 14:17.857
She's not wrong.

14:19.249 --> 14:20.860
Let me handle this.

14:24.646 --> 14:27.910
Trick-or-treat, boys.
One for each.

14:32.306 --> 14:34.525
If I had four of these things,
I could rule the world.

14:41.315 --> 14:42.925
[Molly]
I just think if we're
gonna spend the money

14:43.012 --> 14:44.753
on a hot lunch program,
and there should be

14:44.840 --> 14:46.363
healthy choices for the kids.

14:46.450 --> 14:47.712
I mean, have you seen
what they're serving?

14:47.799 --> 14:49.932
Oh, no, I try to avoid
the cafeteria.

14:50.019 --> 14:51.368
[laughing]

14:52.804 --> 14:54.676
Well, uh, most
of what they're getting

14:54.763 --> 14:56.591
is either starch or sugar

14:56.678 --> 14:58.593
which is why the kids crash
every afternoon.

14:58.680 --> 15:00.508
Do we really
want to change that?

15:00.595 --> 15:02.162
Because I actually
enjoy the quiet.

15:02.249 --> 15:04.338
[laughing]

15:04.425 --> 15:07.558
Well, I'm just saying,
if we use more of our budget

15:07.645 --> 15:09.865
on healthy foods, I mean,
their brains would work better

15:09.952 --> 15:12.999
and we wouldn't have to Taser
them to get them to study.

15:13.086 --> 15:14.609
You know, I think
you're onto something.

15:14.696 --> 15:16.219
I love the idea of Tasers.

15:16.306 --> 15:18.265
[laughing]

15:18.352 --> 15:20.223
Oh, excuse me.

15:20.310 --> 15:23.792
Yeah, why don't you Taser this.

15:23.879 --> 15:26.490
Come on, Mike,
let's just get out of here.

15:26.577 --> 15:29.798
What? They just brought
out the little meatballs.

15:29.885 --> 15:32.540
I don't fit in with these people
with their Ivy league schools

15:32.627 --> 15:34.281
and their inside jokes.

15:34.368 --> 15:37.719
I mean, I'm not cut out
for grade school politics.

15:37.806 --> 15:40.896
And Cleopatra's got her head
so far up Edgar Allen Poe's ass

15:40.983 --> 15:43.333
that she can smell
Voltaire's feet.

15:46.162 --> 15:48.121
I have no idea what any of
that means, but it sounds like

15:48.208 --> 15:49.600
you're not pissed off
at me anymore.

15:51.472 --> 15:53.648
Mike, I'm, I'm sorry I made you
come to this with me.

15:53.735 --> 15:55.606
- Come on, let's go.
- Oh, hang on.

15:55.693 --> 15:58.131
- You're just gonna give up?
- What's the point?

15:58.218 --> 15:59.871
The school board's
just gonna hand the job

15:59.959 --> 16:01.177
to somebody
with advanced degrees

16:01.264 --> 16:03.440
from a fancy college
like they always do.

16:03.527 --> 16:05.616
And that's the reason
nothin' ever changes.

16:05.703 --> 16:07.575
And that's why you wanted to get
involved in the first place

16:07.662 --> 16:08.880
to make a difference, right?

16:08.968 --> 16:09.925
Right.

16:10.012 --> 16:11.492
You gonna let Amadeus and Cher

16:11.579 --> 16:12.841
knock you off your path?

16:14.843 --> 16:17.150
- It's Voltaire and Cleopatra.
- Whatever.

16:17.237 --> 16:19.935
You are bride of freakin'
Frankenstein, lady.

16:20.022 --> 16:22.285
And we Frankensteins have heart.

16:22.372 --> 16:24.896
It may not be our own..

16:24.984 --> 16:27.551
...but it beats strong
and we lead with it.

16:27.638 --> 16:29.945
Now get over there and show 'em
who you're made of.

16:31.642 --> 16:32.992
You're right.

16:35.777 --> 16:37.387
Excuse me.

16:37.474 --> 16:39.476
Principal Gilmartin,
I just wanted to thank you again

16:39.563 --> 16:41.913
for inviting us,
and I want to let you know

16:42.001 --> 16:44.786
that I'm determined to be
your next vice-principal.

16:44.873 --> 16:47.528
I can't think of anybody else
who would be better at it

16:47.615 --> 16:49.225
and of course that's up to you.

16:49.312 --> 16:51.227
If you do make the wrong
decision and I don't get it

16:51.314 --> 16:53.534
I'll just go back to doing
what I've always been doing

16:53.621 --> 16:55.188
which is being the best
damn fourth grade teacher

16:55.275 --> 16:57.538
that school's ever seen.

16:57.625 --> 16:59.540
No, no, no!

17:04.719 --> 17:08.984
Personally, I think you'd make
a wonderful vice-principal.

17:09.071 --> 17:10.681
- Really?
- Absolutely.

17:10.768 --> 17:14.250
You're hard working and clearly
dedicated to your students.

17:15.251 --> 17:16.992
Okay. Terrific.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.516
I guess
there's nothing left to do

17:19.603 --> 17:22.432
but get hammered and make out
with my big green boyfriend.

17:23.999 --> 17:26.045
- Happy Halloween.
- It's getting there.

17:27.742 --> 17:31.050
He's a nice guy.
I'll have his job in a year.

17:34.444 --> 17:36.142
You're a monster!

17:46.065 --> 17:47.979
[laughing]

17:51.026 --> 17:51.983
[roaring]

17:52.071 --> 17:54.160
[screaming]

17:54.247 --> 17:56.553
[laughing]

17:56.640 --> 17:58.425
I love Halloween.

17:58.512 --> 17:59.556
[growling]

18:18.749 --> 18:20.882
[Samuel]
'Well, that was
a humiliating experience.'

18:22.710 --> 18:23.972
Forget about it.
Hey, sit down.

18:24.059 --> 18:25.974
I'll buy you some breakfast.

19:01.923 --> 19:04.839
[theme music]
