WEBVTT

00:24.983 --> 00:26.776
Airport's a good 45 from here,

00:26.902 --> 00:30.279
but I figure you'll be all right
if you leave in the next two minutes.

00:31.448 --> 00:35.702
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, my friend,
but you gave me until 2:15, right?

00:36.120 --> 00:38.329
Yeah. Now you got two minutes.

00:40.457 --> 00:44.377
You know, I've been coming here
ever since I was a kid,

00:44.461 --> 00:47.755
ever since this was nothing
but old Jews and old Cubans.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.882
And to tell you the truth, I love it here.
I really do.

00:50.008 --> 00:53.511
I loved it then, and I love it now.
So I'm not gonna leave. So...

00:53.637 --> 00:55.513
Have a meal with me. Okay? You hungry?

00:57.224 --> 01:02.186
I swear, you pass up, these are
the best crab cakes in town. I swear to God.

01:02.980 --> 01:06.190
Much better than that crap
we were eating in Managua. Remember that?

01:06.316 --> 01:08.818
I don't know if that was Mexican,
Puerto Rican, I don't know what it was,

01:08.902 --> 01:10.695
but it was crap. Remember? I hated it.

01:11.029 --> 01:14.323
I didn't mind it.
I had some pork dish I quite liked.

01:14.408 --> 01:15.533
One minute.

01:16.160 --> 01:18.870
A second ago, you said two minutes.
What's going on here?

01:18.996 --> 01:20.371
Time flies, huh?

01:21.665 --> 01:24.333
You. You're a character.

01:24.835 --> 01:28.421
I was telling my friends this morning
how yesterday you come to me and,

01:29.214 --> 01:32.675
"You don't get out of town in 24 hours,
I'm gonna shoot you on sight!"

01:33.218 --> 01:34.761
Come on, what is that?

01:34.845 --> 01:36.345
They thought it was a joke,
they started laughing.

01:37.264 --> 01:41.184
You tell them about the man you killed?
The way you did it?

01:42.102 --> 01:44.395
'Cause I found nothing funny in that.

01:44.688 --> 01:47.273
Maybe I should've killed you, huh?
Maybe I made a mistake.

01:47.357 --> 01:50.276
Well, we all have regrets.

01:51.028 --> 01:53.613
Cut me a little slack here, okay?

01:54.865 --> 01:58.034
Does nothing count that I let you live?

01:59.203 --> 02:04.040
No! I'm giving you the same consideration
right now. You can get up and go.

02:04.541 --> 02:05.792
Thirty seconds.

02:07.044 --> 02:09.169
So what are you gonna do?

02:09.253 --> 02:12.298
In front of all these people,
you're gonna pull out a gun

02:12.382 --> 02:14.550
and you're gonna shoot an unarmed man?

02:15.552 --> 02:16.969
You're unarmed, huh?

02:17.429 --> 02:20.389
Hey, you got eyes. You see a piece on me?

02:22.476 --> 02:23.559
Twenty seconds.

02:25.229 --> 02:26.395
Okay.

02:29.066 --> 02:30.274
Ten.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.860
You know what? Seriously?

02:32.945 --> 02:37.615
You come in here, interrupt my meal,
you won't eat with me. This is bullshit.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.576
This is supreme bullshit.

03:15.946 --> 03:17.780
The US Attorney's gonna
have a lot of questions.

03:17.865 --> 03:19.198
Nothing I can't answer.

03:19.449 --> 03:21.492
They might think that you cornered him,
didn't give him a choice.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.119
Oh, he had a choice.

03:23.203 --> 03:26.289
How's the hat? I was wondering if it shrunk,
you know, got a little too tight,

03:26.373 --> 03:29.959
you had to take it off your head
and now you're suffering from sunstroke.

03:30.043 --> 03:33.629
You do know that we're not allowed
to shoot people on sight anymore?

03:33.714 --> 03:35.131
- I didn't.
- And haven't been for,

03:35.215 --> 03:36.424
I don't know, maybe 100 years?

03:36.508 --> 03:39.969
- He pulled first.
- It's not about who pulled first.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.972
You remember that meth head last year?
The one who pulled the shotgun?

03:43.056 --> 03:44.765
That ended up on what, page 9?

03:44.850 --> 03:48.060
This? This bullshit?
This is gonna be on the nightly news.

04:03.619 --> 04:08.414
DOJ inquiry number 359826

04:08.498 --> 04:11.876
into the shooting death
of Thomas Francis Buckley

04:11.960 --> 04:16.005
on March 3, 2010 in Miami, Florida.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.632
Would you like to make a statement?

04:18.716 --> 04:22.970
The Marshal's office has conducted
an internal investigation of the proceedings

04:23.055 --> 04:25.556
- that occurred at the hotel in question on...
- Dan.

04:25.641 --> 04:28.392
Come on. Let's just keep it simple, huh?

04:28.852 --> 04:31.187
He pulled first. I shot him.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.154
Well, I thought that went well.

04:40.238 --> 04:42.031
You thought that went well?

04:42.115 --> 04:44.075
I had a phone call this morning
from the Director.

04:44.159 --> 04:46.827
Before that, the Director got a phone call
from the AG.

04:46.912 --> 04:48.079
Let me put it to you this way.

04:48.163 --> 04:50.623
The weather forecast is for a shitload of shit

04:50.707 --> 04:52.541
raining down on this office
from Washington.

04:53.085 --> 04:55.044
I'm gonna reassign you.

04:55.879 --> 04:59.090
- Prison Transport?
- No, I'm getting you out of Dodge.

04:59.174 --> 05:01.175
They need manpower
in the Eastern District of Kentucky.

05:01.385 --> 05:03.511
I talked to the chief of the district,
Art Mullen,

05:03.679 --> 05:05.805
says you guys taught Firearms together
at Glynco.

05:06.181 --> 05:09.308
No, no, Dan. I grew up in Kentucky.
I don't wanna go back there.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.478
Well, then we have a problem, because
you don't wanna go back to Kentucky,

05:12.562 --> 05:14.730
and you cannot, under any circumstances,
stay here.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.193
Got any other skills?

05:38.422 --> 05:42.091
A bit of a comedown from the Miami office,
I'd expect.

05:42.801 --> 05:44.635
Not with you here.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.721
Good to see you.

05:47.431 --> 05:49.849
Well, I won't overwhelm you
with everybody's names right now.

05:49.933 --> 05:52.727
- You wanna go have a drink?
- Sounds good.

05:53.645 --> 05:56.605
Follow me, and I'll pack up and we'll go.

05:57.482 --> 06:01.402
You look the same as you did at Glynco.
Same coat, same boots.

06:01.737 --> 06:03.112
The boots are fairly new.

06:04.114 --> 06:08.034
- Don't tell me that hat is.
- No, it's old.

06:08.493 --> 06:09.994
Have a seat.

06:13.165 --> 06:16.584
- You were working Fugitives in Miami, huh?
- Yeah, I did.

06:17.335 --> 06:20.254
Yeah. Well, here,
everybody does everything.

06:20.338 --> 06:25.342
Fugitives, Witness Relocation,
Judicial Protection, Forfeitures,

06:25.427 --> 06:26.635
Prisoner Transport.

06:26.720 --> 06:30.848
Boy, every office I ever worked in,
Prisoner Transport was the shit detail.

06:30.932 --> 06:34.185
The Chief always used it as punishment.
But here, we all do it.

06:34.269 --> 06:36.854
- Even you?
- Oh, hell, no.

06:36.938 --> 06:38.898
I heard about you and Winona.

06:39.024 --> 06:42.276
- From who?
- Winona. She works here.

06:42.527 --> 06:46.155
- In Lexington?
- In the courthouse. She's a court reporter.

06:46.698 --> 06:50.451
Well, I knew she was coming back
to Kentucky. I think her mom took ill.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.536
I thought that was why you picked Kentucky.

06:52.913 --> 06:56.373
Art, no offense, I didn't pick Kentucky.

06:58.001 --> 07:01.003
I talked to your marshal down there in Miami.

07:01.546 --> 07:04.715
- Tell me about the shooting.
- It was justified.

07:08.095 --> 07:09.929
You concerned
about me coming down here?

07:10.347 --> 07:12.306
It's a small office, Raylan.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.850
I'm concerned
when we switch brands of coffee.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.230
Is your dad still down there in Harlan?

07:19.689 --> 07:23.067
- Far as I know.
- Thought you were from there.

07:23.151 --> 07:26.904
Reason I ask, US Attorney's trying to
build this case against this guy in Harlan,

07:26.988 --> 07:29.865
and he's about the same age as you.
It's a small town.

07:30.200 --> 07:32.159
Thought you might know him.
Boyd Crowder?

07:32.619 --> 07:35.913
My God, Art, any other shit
you wanna dump on me tonight?

07:36.164 --> 07:38.874
- You do know him.
- Yeah, I know him.

07:39.501 --> 07:42.586
Yeah, Boyd and I dug coal together
when we were 19.

07:44.756 --> 07:47.299
Well, Boyd? What do you think?

07:47.384 --> 07:49.760
Well, Jared, I think it sucks.

07:50.428 --> 07:52.138
What? Why?

07:53.390 --> 07:54.890
I appreciate the sentiment,

07:54.975 --> 07:59.478
wanting to go after a federal building
under construction,

07:59.563 --> 08:02.314
but, you see, we'd need us a whole box
of Emulex to bring that down,

08:02.399 --> 08:05.568
and that's if you got cuts in the steel.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.403
All we got is a rocket launcher.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.030
And impressive as that is,
the only thing it's gonna do

08:10.115 --> 08:12.283
is knock some shit around.

08:12.367 --> 08:15.661
But don't you worry about it.
We'll just go to plan B.

08:15.912 --> 08:18.205
- Plan B?
- Oh, yeah.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.875
Yeah, there's always a plan B.

08:28.842 --> 08:33.386
It used to be a couple of crackers
in an SUV would set the jungle on edge.

08:34.097 --> 08:36.515
These surely are end times.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.977
All right, this is it right here.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.938
See this street up here? Make a right.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.530
This is good right here.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.409
Well, I believe we can take it from here.

08:56.995 --> 08:58.662
What, you gonna blow up that church?

08:58.955 --> 09:02.041
Boyd, there's people on the streets.

09:02.334 --> 09:04.293
They're gonna see us,
they're gonna ID my car!

09:04.836 --> 09:06.879
You worried about your car?

09:13.470 --> 09:14.595
Fire in the hole!

09:29.194 --> 09:31.320
Boyd became a powder man.

09:32.197 --> 09:36.575
He'd crawl down a hole with his case
of Emulex 520, come out stringing wire,

09:36.660 --> 09:39.036
call out "Fire in the hole" to clear the shaft.

09:39.120 --> 09:42.039
She'd blow and we'd go back in,
dig out the pieces.

09:42.374 --> 09:43.624
We weren't what you'd call buddies,

09:43.708 --> 09:47.169
but you work a deep mine with a man,
you look out for each other.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.630
Well, after that, he joined the Army.

09:49.714 --> 09:54.760
He went to Kuwait for Desert Storm, and
when he came back after a couple of years,

09:54.844 --> 09:56.720
he quit paying his taxes.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.014
Claimed that he was a sovereign citizen,

09:59.099 --> 10:02.643
and so US Attorney just sent him down
to Alderson.

10:03.561 --> 10:06.397
That's where he got involved
with the Patriot Movement

10:06.481 --> 10:09.149
and the white supremacy bullshit.

10:09.442 --> 10:13.988
Got to making horseshit bombs,
you know, fertilizer and fuel oil.

10:14.072 --> 10:17.199
They'll come into a town like Somerset
and they'll blow up a car.

10:17.284 --> 10:20.202
Then while the cops are busy,
they'll go rob a bank.

10:20.412 --> 10:23.289
- Saw that in a Steve McQueen movie.
- Yeah.

10:23.415 --> 10:25.332
Well, these guys ain't movie actors.

10:26.251 --> 10:28.127
Did he change much?

10:28.670 --> 10:32.131
Other than the fact
that he's now a racist asshole?

10:32.382 --> 10:35.342
He's lost some hair, but that's about it.

11:01.244 --> 11:03.746
How come you didn't want to blow up
that church?

11:04.164 --> 11:07.541
I told you, I didn't want them to ID my car.

11:08.001 --> 11:11.337
I got to thinking that maybe you had
an aversion to hurting people.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.674
- Hell, no.
- Yeah, well, I also got to thinking

11:15.759 --> 11:20.846
that a building under construction
might just be the kind of innocuous target...

11:20.930 --> 11:23.599
You know what that means?
That means harmless.

11:23.683 --> 11:27.019
It might just be the kind of harmless target
that the Federal Bureau of Imperialism

11:27.103 --> 11:31.565
might be willing to sacrifice in order
to get somebody deep in the movement.

11:31.733 --> 11:32.900
You think I'm a snitch?

11:33.860 --> 11:36.028
All I know is, you don't have any tattoos.

11:36.237 --> 11:39.031
You keep rubbing that head like
you don't think that hair's gonna grow back.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.949
You think I'm a snitch
'cause I rub my head?

11:41.618 --> 11:44.536
I mean, you understand
where I'm coming from, right?

11:44.621 --> 11:48.123
I mean, you come out here from Oklahoma
full of piss and vinegar,

11:48.249 --> 11:50.542
talking about how you were tired
of spray-painting synagogues,

11:50.627 --> 11:52.711
- saying you want to blow some shit up...
- Hey!

11:54.214 --> 11:57.299
You don't believe me, you check it out!
Why don't you call Oklahoma?

11:57.467 --> 12:00.302
We are. Devil's doing it as we speak.

12:00.470 --> 12:01.595
Yeah.

12:03.264 --> 12:05.265
You'll see, Boyd. I ain't no snitch.

12:05.725 --> 12:09.603
Yeah, well, like you said, we'll see.

12:14.818 --> 12:17.236
- Right there.
- Hey, turn that shit off.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.487
Why don't you eat my ass?

12:18.571 --> 12:19.655
Hey, how'd it go?

12:19.739 --> 12:21.073
- Out of the way.
- Get over.

12:21.157 --> 12:24.660
The primary was a waste of time,
but took care of the secondary just fine.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.495
Where you at?

12:26.579 --> 12:29.248
East of 75 on Tates Creek Road.

12:29.999 --> 12:33.794
Oh, hey, you got a call from Oklahoma.
Jared checks out.

12:35.338 --> 12:36.922
How did he do?

12:39.926 --> 12:41.343
I had to let Jared go.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.974
Was it 'cause you didn't trust him
or you just didn't like him much?

12:47.475 --> 12:49.768
Probably a little bit of both.

12:50.687 --> 12:53.522
I am gonna need you to pick me up, though.

13:08.538 --> 13:11.874
I will show that my client
did not engage in fraud.

13:12.542 --> 13:15.544
A report by a forensic accountant
will show that any anomalies

13:15.670 --> 13:18.839
are due entirely
to a misentering of amounts,

13:19.007 --> 13:22.301
a common bookkeeping error,
and by no means fraud.

13:23.178 --> 13:24.678
Thank you, Counselor.

13:25.054 --> 13:28.056
Will the prosecution
please approach the jury?

13:28.224 --> 13:32.728
Thank you, Your Honor. It might seem
like a simple technical mistake,

13:33.229 --> 13:36.064
but the State will prove
there was malicious intent...

13:36.191 --> 13:37.691
One second.

13:39.235 --> 13:42.821
Sorry. I was in the courthouse.
I'll be up in a minute.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.242
Tates Creek Road?

13:48.203 --> 13:50.496
I think I know where that is.

14:06.554 --> 14:10.724
County Sheriff's deputy found it
just after dawn. Name's Jared Hale.

14:10.934 --> 14:13.101
Bureau has him listed
as some kind of Aryan Knight.

14:13.228 --> 14:16.021
Oklahoma driver's license and registration.

14:16.105 --> 14:19.608
- You got him connected to Boyd?
- So far, tenuously.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.235
I talked to his sister in Tulsa,

14:21.361 --> 14:25.280
and she said that he came to Kentucky
to hook up with some Commandos.

14:25.406 --> 14:28.617
Now, that's probably the murder weapon.
It's recently been fired.

14:28.743 --> 14:32.371
There's no prints on it.
In fact, the whole vehicle's clean,

14:32.455 --> 14:34.081
except for this.

14:35.708 --> 14:37.459
Now do you know what that is?

14:37.544 --> 14:39.044
I didn't, either.

14:39.128 --> 14:42.047
That is the cap that goes
on the end of a rocket launcher.

14:42.131 --> 14:44.132
- No shit.
- Yep.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.302
And last night in Lexington,
we had a church bombing,

14:47.387 --> 14:50.639
and the Feeb says that whoever did it
used a rocket launcher.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.065
Hey, all the wits say the same.

15:00.149 --> 15:04.570
Two white males drove up in a dark SUV,
they parked at that corner by the curb.

15:04.654 --> 15:07.990
One male got out
with what looked like a bazooka.

15:08.116 --> 15:10.409
He said a few words
and then fired at the church.

15:10.493 --> 15:12.327
What did he say,
the fella who got out of the SUV?

15:12.453 --> 15:17.249
One said it was, "Liars and hos."
Another heard, "Time to go."

15:17.333 --> 15:19.501
My favorite's "Heidy, heidy, heidy, ho."

15:19.627 --> 15:21.587
Maybe we should put an APB out
on Cab Calloway.

15:21.671 --> 15:24.339
- I think he's dead.
- Then he should be easy to find.

15:24.465 --> 15:28.844
The pastor had it different.
He heard the man say, "Fire in the hole."

15:29.012 --> 15:31.096
You know what you can do?
Just do your job!

15:31.180 --> 15:32.598
I can understand why you're upset...

15:32.682 --> 15:34.683
Did the good pastor say
he got a good look at the shooter?

15:35.351 --> 15:38.145
- He says no.
- I bet if we put Crowder in a line-up

15:38.229 --> 15:41.523
and told the pastor that the trigger man
was there, it might jog his memory.

15:41.733 --> 15:45.402
Rachel, why don't you go ask our old friend
if he'll have a word with us?

15:47.405 --> 15:50.073
- Be nice.
- When am I ever not nice?

15:52.368 --> 15:55.329
You think Fandi's gonna wanna cooperate?

15:56.080 --> 16:01.501
Fandi is Ethiopian by way of Jamaica
by way of being completely full of shit.

16:02.879 --> 16:06.256
The Temple of the Cool and Beautiful JC
was one of those churches

16:06.382 --> 16:08.800
that claims that marijuana
is a sacramental herb.

16:08.885 --> 16:12.304
- It is protected by the Constitution!
- The Constitution of Dope Sellers?

16:12.388 --> 16:14.556
'Cause selling ganja to kids
means you're a drug dealer!

16:14.682 --> 16:17.559
I could've sworn I told her to be nice.

16:17.685 --> 16:20.854
Pastor Fandi, if I could just talk to you
for just one moment...

16:20.938 --> 16:22.272
No, you could not.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.859
I saw Peter Tosh once.

16:27.737 --> 16:30.614
You assume because I'm black
and have a Jamaican accent, I like reggae?

16:32.742 --> 16:36.370
People assume a lot about me.
It's the way of the world.

16:39.374 --> 16:41.083
How was he? Peter Tosh.

16:43.628 --> 16:46.338
He was not my taste,
but the girl I was chasing loved him,

16:46.422 --> 16:49.758
and I let her stay until the encore
before I took her off to jail.

16:53.096 --> 16:54.596
What do you want?

17:17.119 --> 17:20.288
- That was a close one.
- I felt the air move!

17:25.127 --> 17:36.471
Boyd!

17:37.765 --> 17:41.101
- What's all the fuss? They out of Velveeta?
- Your brother got shot.

17:41.644 --> 17:44.146
- What? Where?
- At his house.

17:44.856 --> 17:47.482
No, dumbass, where on his body?

17:47.692 --> 17:48.817
I don't know.

17:49.152 --> 17:52.988
- Well, is it serious?
- Oh, yeah. He's dead.

17:53.656 --> 17:55.907
Did you know Bowman Crowder,
Boyd's brother?

17:55.992 --> 17:59.035
Sort of. Star running back in high school.

17:59.162 --> 18:01.663
Boyd was always saying
Bowman had the goods to go pro.

18:01.789 --> 18:05.792
- I was never that sure.
- You remember the girl he married, Ava?

18:05.960 --> 18:08.170
If it's the same one.
She lived down the street.

18:08.296 --> 18:10.005
- She's married to Bowman?
- She was.

18:10.131 --> 18:13.759
She ended the union last night
with a.30-06.

18:13.843 --> 18:15.427
Plugged him right through the heart.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.471
That's the Sheriff's report.
She admits shooting him.

18:17.555 --> 18:22.184
Says she got tired of Bowman getting drunk
and beating her.

18:23.519 --> 18:27.397
- She still in custody?
- She was arraigned 10 minutes ago. ROR.

18:28.691 --> 18:29.983
Did you talk to her?

18:30.067 --> 18:34.571
I did. I told her, given Boyd's reputation,
he's probably gonna come looking for her.

18:34.697 --> 18:38.200
She said it's none of our business.
I told her it is if he shoots her.

18:38.326 --> 18:40.911
We should go talk to her again.
Is that the address?

18:41.037 --> 18:44.539
Yeah, but good luck in finding it.
I tried to map it, got nothing.

18:46.375 --> 18:50.629
Well, I guess some places haven't been
entered into the system, like North Korea

18:50.713 --> 18:52.714
and Raylan's hometown.

18:53.257 --> 18:54.841
I know where it is.

19:20.201 --> 19:24.704
...word of faith, and it puts the believer
in the driver's seat.

19:24.789 --> 19:30.460
And it puts God and his will
and his plan for your life

19:30.586 --> 19:32.212
in the passenger's seat.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.631
Oh, my God. Raylan!

19:34.966 --> 19:38.718
- You remember me, huh?
- I never forgot you.

19:50.857 --> 19:54.860
I had a crush on you
from the time I was 12 years old.

19:56.487 --> 19:59.698
I knew you liked me,
but you didn't want to show it.

19:59.782 --> 20:02.868
- You were too young.
- I was 16 when you left.

20:04.287 --> 20:06.496
I heard you got married.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.291
Are you still?

20:09.959 --> 20:11.543
Turned out to be a mistake.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.547
You want to talk about mistakes?

20:15.631 --> 20:17.716
I told Bowman I wanted a divorce,

20:17.800 --> 20:21.177
he goes, "You file,
you'll never be seen again."

20:22.305 --> 20:24.931
He said I'd disappear
from the face of the Earth.

20:26.517 --> 20:28.393
Do you want a drink?

20:29.103 --> 20:30.729
I'd love one.

20:32.773 --> 20:36.026
I married him a year out of high school,
because he was cute.

20:36.110 --> 20:40.322
He was sure of himself and he told me
he'd never work in a goddamn coal mine.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.616
He'd wear the blue and white
of the University of Kentucky,

20:42.700 --> 20:45.452
and then he'd get drafted by a pro team.

20:45.536 --> 20:47.287
He wouldn't mind the Cowboys.

20:48.956 --> 20:54.044
What do you want in yours?
I got Diet Coca-Cola, RC Cola, Dr. Pepper...

20:54.128 --> 20:55.337
Just ice.

20:55.588 --> 20:58.757
I ever forget to fill the trays,
Bowman'd start slapping me.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.760
"What's wrong with you?
Don't you know how to keep house?"

21:02.094 --> 21:06.389
That all started as soon as he realized
he was never getting out of Harlan.

21:07.308 --> 21:11.019
He blamed it on me.
It was my fault he had to dig coal.

21:11.812 --> 21:16.149
It was my fault that I had a miscarriage
after he beat me with his belt

21:16.233 --> 21:22.238
and he didn't have a son to take hunting
with him and his creepy brother, Boyd.

21:27.954 --> 21:33.124
Last time he hit me, it was because
I called his brother "creepy" to his face.

21:34.460 --> 21:39.506
And he kept after me with that belt
till I fell and I hit my head on the stove.

21:41.884 --> 21:46.262
I got up off that floor knowing
that he was never gonna hit me again.

21:47.056 --> 21:52.060
The next night, he came in,
I had his favorite supper on the table.

21:52.645 --> 21:57.440
Ham and yams, and cream-style corn
and leftover okra fixed with tomatoes.

21:59.068 --> 22:02.195
I waited till he was shoving food in his face,

22:02.279 --> 22:04.072
then I got his deer rifle
from the kitchen closet

22:04.156 --> 22:07.325
and I went in there
and I did what I had to do.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.122
I just finished cleaning it up.

22:12.206 --> 22:17.168
I had to scrub the wall with Lysol,
you know, to get the stain off of it.

22:17.503 --> 22:19.754
Lysol's the best cleaning product
you could buy.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.093
I've still got a knot

22:25.177 --> 22:29.180
where I fell and I hit my head
on the stove. You want to feel it?

22:29.765 --> 22:31.016
Dear Lord, my hair's a mess.

22:32.143 --> 22:35.937
You close your eyes!
I don't want you to see me like this.

22:36.897 --> 22:38.106
Raylan,

22:39.942 --> 22:44.279
the minute you walked in,
I knew everything was gonna be all right.

22:45.656 --> 22:49.034
- I was right about you.
- About what?

22:50.036 --> 22:53.204
Having a crush on you. You're a good kisser.

22:54.874 --> 22:58.334
- I was thinking we'd have to stop doing that.
- Why?

23:00.171 --> 23:04.591
This isn't a social call, Ava.
I came to Harlan on business.

23:05.342 --> 23:09.471
Well, you tell me all about your business
when I get out of the shower.

23:18.981 --> 23:21.524
Who in the hell are you, the undertaker?

23:22.443 --> 23:25.695
I might be undertaking a situation here.

23:28.657 --> 23:29.866
Let me see your chest.

23:36.832 --> 23:40.168
You buy that necklace,
or poach the gator and yank the teeth out?

23:40.252 --> 23:42.128
I shot her and ate her tail.

23:42.421 --> 23:44.547
That would put you in Florida,
around Lake Okeechobee.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.299
Belle Glade. Who are you?

23:46.592 --> 23:50.011
Raylan Givens.
I'm a Deputy United States Marshal.

23:50.262 --> 23:52.263
You mind telling me who you are?

23:53.974 --> 23:55.183
You know your name, don't you?

23:56.769 --> 23:58.103
I'm Dewey. Dewey Crowe.

23:58.604 --> 24:02.398
I sent a boy to Starke from Belle Glade,
fellow named Dale Crowe Jr.

24:03.734 --> 24:04.901
He's my kin.

24:07.822 --> 24:11.741
- What are you doing here, Mr. Crowe?
- I come to take Ava someplace. Ava!

24:11.867 --> 24:13.409
Let me tell you something.

24:13.953 --> 24:17.038
You don't walk into a person's house
unless you're invited.

24:17.123 --> 24:19.916
What you better do is
go on outside and knock on the door.

24:21.127 --> 24:25.213
If Ava wants to see you, I'll let you in.
If she don't, you be on your way.

24:28.801 --> 24:31.886
All right. I'm gonna go out.

24:34.557 --> 24:36.558
And then I'm coming back in.

24:51.699 --> 24:56.411
Mr. Crowe. You better hold on there a sec
while I explain something to you.

24:58.622 --> 25:00.331
I want you to understand,

25:00.416 --> 25:02.792
I don't pull my sidearm
unless I'm gonna shoot to kill.

25:03.919 --> 25:07.547
That's its purpose, huh? To kill?
So it's how I use it.

25:09.508 --> 25:12.677
I want you to think about that
before you act and it's too late.

25:13.137 --> 25:16.931
Jesus Christ, I got a scattergun
pointed right at you.

25:19.185 --> 25:22.061
Can you rack in a load
before I put a hole through you?

25:35.117 --> 25:36.951
- Where'd you want to take Ava?
- Man, I don't understand you.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.620
- Boyd want to see her?
- It's none of your business.

25:38.704 --> 25:42.165
You know Boyd and I were buddies?
We dug coal and drank beer together.

25:42.249 --> 25:46.211
In fact, you see him,
you tell him I'm in Harlan, all right?

25:52.218 --> 25:56.012
Hey, if I was you,
I'd give up this Nazi bullshit.

25:56.555 --> 26:01.226
- Go back to poaching gators. It's safer.
- Next time I see you, I'm gonna...

26:05.272 --> 26:08.650
Tell Boyd his old buddy wants to see him.
Raylan Givens.

26:16.909 --> 26:19.827
Only reason I don't take Ava out
and shoot her,

26:20.663 --> 26:22.997
is I see she had no choice in what she done.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.916
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I loved my brother,

26:25.167 --> 26:28.419
but you knew Bowman,
you knew how he could get.

26:29.964 --> 26:33.424
And that woman, she showed some spunk,
you think about it, doing what she did.

26:33.509 --> 26:34.717
And then there's the Bible.

26:34.885 --> 26:38.012
In the Bible, it says that a man should see
to the needs of his brother's widow,

26:38.097 --> 26:39.430
and I intend to do that.

26:41.767 --> 26:45.853
- Well, they sure are taking their sweet time.
- Hey, let me ask you something.

26:45.938 --> 26:48.648
Shouldn't we have our money
from your boys in Lexington by now?

26:48.732 --> 26:50.650
I'll give them a call.
Don't worry, they're good for it.

26:50.734 --> 26:53.194
Yeah, you're damn right they're good for it.

26:53.279 --> 26:56.864
'Cause if they ain't good for it, I'll go
down there and blow their shit up, too.

26:58.492 --> 26:59.575
Hey!

27:03.038 --> 27:04.372
Come on! Come on!

27:06.667 --> 27:07.792
Go!

27:07.876 --> 27:09.502
- Right now?
- Yeah, right now!

27:09.586 --> 27:12.463
- Right now? Right now?
- Come on, let's go!

27:21.932 --> 27:25.018
- Who was that?
- Dewey Crowe.

27:26.186 --> 27:28.563
The one with the Heil Hitler on his neck?

27:28.647 --> 27:31.065
He was one of Bowman's buddies.

27:32.901 --> 27:35.945
You haven't seen Boyd? I mean, since?

27:36.405 --> 27:37.488
No.

27:39.074 --> 27:42.535
But he'll be after me, I know.
He's been after me.

27:43.412 --> 27:46.039
Yeah. That's why
we want to keep an eye on you.

27:46.123 --> 27:48.791
You know I'm with the Marshals Service.

27:48.876 --> 27:52.211
I believe your mother told me,
before she passed.

27:52.588 --> 27:54.922
You been to see your father?

27:57.509 --> 28:00.136
Are you looking for Boyd?

28:01.347 --> 28:04.474
We are. But we have to catch him in the act.

28:05.476 --> 28:08.186
Robbing a bank, blowing up a church,

28:08.771 --> 28:11.147
making an attempt on your life.

28:11.648 --> 28:15.151
- Mine?
- You said yourself he'll be coming after you.

28:17.112 --> 28:20.782
Raylan, Boyd don't want to shoot me,

28:20.866 --> 28:24.786
he wants to go to bed with me.

28:27.831 --> 28:30.416
You want me to help you catch him?

28:31.126 --> 28:34.462
Maybe you could just get him to talk to me.

28:35.756 --> 28:37.757
I could do that.

28:37.841 --> 28:40.051
- You know where he is?
- I do.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.348
And did you want to tell me?

28:47.476 --> 28:49.477
What do I get if I do?

29:09.540 --> 29:13.000
Hey, who do you know drives a Town Car?

29:16.797 --> 29:21.300
Look at you! A suit, a necktie.

29:22.052 --> 29:25.388
Looking good. Looking like a lawman.

29:29.560 --> 29:32.854
Now see, this is how you wear a hat,
all casual.

29:32.938 --> 29:35.648
Not down on your goddamn ears
like you do.

29:36.817 --> 29:40.611
I heard you called on Ava.
My boy Dewey said he had to run you off.

29:40.696 --> 29:44.115
- You believe that?
- Not if you say it ain't so.

29:44.199 --> 29:47.702
- Shit, I'll take care of him.
- Devil, get us a jar and two glasses.

29:48.370 --> 29:50.246
This party's just for Raylan and me.

29:50.873 --> 29:51.998
Go on.

29:56.545 --> 29:59.881
He just got his release,
so he's feeling a little itchy.

30:00.257 --> 30:01.340
I can tell.

30:06.763 --> 30:08.222
Old times.

30:16.273 --> 30:18.983
- You been gone too long.
- God damn.

30:20.944 --> 30:24.322
So, what was life like in Florida?

30:25.449 --> 30:28.034
Just as advertised. Sunny and hot.

30:29.328 --> 30:32.955
You know, I just don't think
I could take me a place so flat.

30:33.040 --> 30:36.584
- You seen your daddy yet?
- No. Not yet.

30:37.002 --> 30:39.921
Boy, he was a wild man back in his day,
wasn't he?

30:40.005 --> 30:42.507
What was that scam he had going
back in the early '90s?

30:42.591 --> 30:45.510
Stealing mining machinery,
selling it to the Colombians,

30:45.594 --> 30:48.638
getting paid in cocaine?
You remember that?

30:49.139 --> 30:52.558
Guess I was gone by then.
How's your daddy?

30:53.435 --> 30:55.728
I suspect you know how my daddy is.

30:57.481 --> 31:01.734
Yeah, all those days, good and bad, they all
long gone now. Everything's changed.

31:01.818 --> 31:06.781
It's all changed. The mine has changed.
No more following a seam underground.

31:07.032 --> 31:11.285
Cheaper to take the tops off mountains and
let the slag run down and ruin the creeks.

31:12.037 --> 31:14.956
Hey, you remember the picket lines,
don't you?

31:15.040 --> 31:17.959
Courts backing the company scabs
and gun thugs.

31:20.796 --> 31:23.756
Whose side you think
the government's always been on, Raylan?

31:23.840 --> 31:26.342
Us or the people with money?

31:26.426 --> 31:29.220
And who do you think controls that money?

31:29.304 --> 31:32.640
Who do you think
wants to mongrelize the world?

31:33.809 --> 31:35.810
- Who?
- The Jews.

31:37.980 --> 31:40.481
Boyd, you know any Jews?

31:41.275 --> 31:45.861
See, I recruit skins.
They don't know no more than you do.

31:46.947 --> 31:51.325
And I have to teach them that we have
a moral obligation to get rid of the Jews.

31:51.410 --> 31:54.245
- See, it was in the Bible.
- Where?

31:55.205 --> 31:57.873
In the beginning. It's part of creation.

31:58.375 --> 32:02.420
See, in the beginning, right,
you had your mud people.

32:03.088 --> 32:07.883
They were also referred to as beasts because
they had no souls, see? They were soulless.

32:07.968 --> 32:10.720
And then Cain... You remember Cain, now?

32:11.722 --> 32:14.724
Well, Cain, he laid down
with the mud people,

32:14.808 --> 32:18.144
and out of these fornications
came the Edomites.

32:18.228 --> 32:20.563
Now, do you know who the Edomites are?

32:21.315 --> 32:23.441
- Who?
- They're the Jews, Raylan.

32:23.692 --> 32:27.737
- You're serious?
- Read your Bible as interpreted by experts.

32:31.283 --> 32:34.535
You know, Boyd,
I think you just use the Bible

32:34.620 --> 32:37.955
- to do whatever the hell you like.
- Well, what do you think I like, Raylan?

32:38.123 --> 32:40.374
You like to get money and blow shit up.

32:41.168 --> 32:44.545
I know about your friend Devil
and his record selling dope.

32:44.630 --> 32:48.341
And I'm willing to bet
that you blew up that church in Lexington,

32:48.425 --> 32:50.843
not because it was black
but because it was a dope store.

32:50.927 --> 32:53.929
Ten-to-one says you got paid to do it
by some other dope dealer around

32:54.014 --> 32:57.850
who didn't like the idea of that preacher
getting a free pass from the police.

32:58.310 --> 33:00.728
Win-win for you, wasn't it, Boyd?

33:01.313 --> 33:03.939
Not only did you get to blow
something to smithereens, you got money.

33:05.776 --> 33:09.153
See, I'm giving you the benefit.
You aren't mental.

33:10.072 --> 33:12.740
I know you're not stupid enough
to believe that mud people story.

33:12.824 --> 33:14.200
You think you know me?

33:15.952 --> 33:18.621
Well, I know you,
Deputy Marshal Raylan Givens.

33:18.705 --> 33:21.582
I know you like to shoot bad people.

33:22.250 --> 33:25.670
I heard about that gun thug you shot
in the hotel in Miami.

33:25.921 --> 33:27.463
- You heard about that?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

33:27.547 --> 33:29.507
We have TVs down here now, Raylan.

33:32.344 --> 33:33.928
But, you know,

33:35.389 --> 33:39.475
at any point
when you were looking at that gun thug,

33:41.186 --> 33:42.812
did you see your daddy's face?

33:48.360 --> 33:52.196
The reason I'm here, we're having
a little line-up tomorrow at the courthouse.

33:52.364 --> 33:53.447
What did I do now?

33:53.532 --> 33:59.203
Well, we got a witness,
saw a man fire a bazooka into a church.

34:00.455 --> 34:02.915
Now, I'd appreciate it
if you'd be in that line-up.

34:02.999 --> 34:06.919
- Well, I bet you would.
- You either show up or we'll come get you.

34:07.087 --> 34:09.922
Hey, Raylan, let me ask you a question.

34:11.049 --> 34:14.385
Would you shoot me if you get the chance?

34:15.011 --> 34:16.721
You make me pull, I'll put you down.

34:32.070 --> 34:34.697
Well, Reverend? What do you think?

34:35.072 --> 34:38.576
I don't know, you know. It was dark,
and the man was far away.

34:38.659 --> 34:42.079
If you've had anybody shoot a rocket at you,
you don't stand there and look.

34:42.164 --> 34:44.081
You know, I just run.

34:47.710 --> 34:49.335
Cut him loose.

34:51.505 --> 34:54.382
Well, I did my part and I showed up.

34:54.551 --> 34:58.512
The idea of walking in past a gathering
of law enforcement appealed to you,

34:58.597 --> 35:01.849
especially since you knew that preacher
didn't have the balls to pick you.

35:01.933 --> 35:05.102
It's always good to see you, Raylan. Hey!

35:07.522 --> 35:10.274
You know that man you shot in Florida?

35:10.358 --> 35:13.402
Well, my boy Dewey's cousin down there,
he said he heard a rumor

35:13.487 --> 35:18.783
that you gave that gun thug 24 hours to get
out of town or you'd shoot him on sight.

35:19.409 --> 35:20.618
Is that true?

35:20.869 --> 35:24.038
I gave him the option to leave Miami,
he turned it down.

35:25.165 --> 35:27.208
What would you say
if I made you the same offer,

35:28.001 --> 35:29.835
that you get out of Harlan County
by tomorrow noon

35:29.920 --> 35:32.046
or I'm gonna come looking for you?

35:32.214 --> 35:33.756
Does that sound fair?

35:34.049 --> 35:35.508
Now you're talking.

35:52.943 --> 35:54.276
Hey.

35:55.570 --> 35:58.322
My lawyer's talking to the prosecutor.

36:00.242 --> 36:02.660
Come with me while I smoke.

36:09.835 --> 36:13.003
I plead to manslaughter
and I won't have to go to prison.

36:13.088 --> 36:16.382
Though if I have to, I have to.
It was worth it.

36:18.260 --> 36:20.636
Hey, why don't you come by for supper?

36:20.720 --> 36:25.432
I'll pick up a couple of fryers,
fix you some hot biscuits and gravy.

36:27.102 --> 36:29.562
Look at you, licking your lips!

36:29.646 --> 36:32.314
All my life,
fried chicken's been my favorite.

36:32.399 --> 36:34.567
- But I shouldn't.
- Why not?

36:35.735 --> 36:42.575
Because an officer of the law
isn't supposed to be socializing

36:43.034 --> 36:45.452
with the defendant
in a murder investigation.

36:47.038 --> 36:50.374
- I didn't know that.
- It's sort of frowned upon.

36:54.004 --> 36:56.839
I'm fixing it anyway.
You're a big boy, Raylan.

36:56.923 --> 37:00.801
You want to come,
there's nothing on Earth gonna stop you.

37:01.803 --> 37:04.221
If it weren't for Boyd,
I'd have me some of Ava.

37:04.848 --> 37:08.017
Wasn't for Boyd,
me and you could have us the marshal.

37:09.352 --> 37:13.230
So what did Boyd say, exactly?
He's coming for you, or we're coming?

37:13.982 --> 37:15.608
He said he was.

37:16.401 --> 37:19.320
But we don't know whether he wants
to shoot you or blow you up, do we?

37:19.988 --> 37:24.533
And then again, he could just jump the gun
and come after you when you aren't looking.

37:24.618 --> 37:27.870
If I was you, I'd look under the car
before I turn the key every time.

37:30.123 --> 37:32.958
We're like big-game hunters, Raylan.

37:33.335 --> 37:35.669
Except that you're the bait.

37:36.129 --> 37:38.714
You're kind of like the goat
tethered to the pole,

37:39.090 --> 37:41.175
and all I gotta do is keep you in sight.

37:43.219 --> 37:45.387
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

38:13.124 --> 38:16.293
- Yeah.
- He's at the motel with his friends.

38:16.461 --> 38:18.295
Well, do you see our friends?

38:20.590 --> 38:21.674
I do.

38:23.176 --> 38:25.344
What do you want us to do?

38:26.763 --> 38:28.263
Sit tight.

38:43.071 --> 38:44.321
Hey, Ava.

38:45.448 --> 38:47.408
You expecting someone?

38:48.243 --> 38:49.952
Hey, give me them things.

38:56.584 --> 39:00.462
- What are they doing out there?
- You folks are missing a hell of a show.

39:01.506 --> 39:05.426
- I think Rachel's trying to shoot the moon.
- I don't try, I do.

39:05.510 --> 39:08.554
- And you weep.
- One single, solitary tear.

39:19.107 --> 39:22.067
- Hello.
- Can you smell the chicken frying?

39:23.778 --> 39:26.196
It'll be done by the time you get here.

39:28.950 --> 39:30.617
I'm on my way.

39:36.624 --> 39:39.001
- Boyd's at Ava's.
- You sure?

39:39.419 --> 39:42.921
I'm not saying there was a gun to her head,
but she didn't sound right.

39:58.104 --> 39:59.229
Let's hit it.

40:03.943 --> 40:06.612
Here. Call Raylan.
Tell him to keep the line open.

40:22.545 --> 40:25.339
- Where do you want me?
- Keep going! Get Ava! We got this!

40:25.673 --> 40:28.133
- You got this?
- Go!

40:42.816 --> 40:43.941
You get around.

41:02.210 --> 41:05.420
- You want me to kill them or wing them?
- Let's start with winging.

41:16.558 --> 41:18.392
- You okay?
- I got hit.

41:18.893 --> 41:20.853
- Can you shoot?
- I think so.

41:21.062 --> 41:22.688
Then let's finish this thing.

41:25.233 --> 41:28.569
Please, either one of you,
do something stupid.

41:45.420 --> 41:49.047
- Hey, what are you... He'll see us!
- He's already seen us, you moron.

41:49.132 --> 41:50.632
You want we should wrap ourselves
around a tree?

41:51.467 --> 41:53.218
Christ almighty!

41:56.181 --> 41:59.558
- What the hell's he doing?
- He must be sneaking up on the house.

42:00.310 --> 42:01.768
No, he ain't.

42:11.946 --> 42:14.323
So? Tell me. What's going on?

42:18.703 --> 42:20.704
I'm sorry, I didn't hear you guys.

42:20.788 --> 42:23.540
There ain't nothing going on, all right?
We was just out riding around.

42:26.669 --> 42:29.630
All right! Boyd just wants
to have a word with you, is all.

42:29.923 --> 42:33.091
- He told me he was gonna shoot me.
- Then what are you asking us for, asshole?

42:35.178 --> 42:36.678
Outlaw life's hard, ain't it?

42:37.222 --> 42:39.973
Cuff your left hand, put it through
the steering wheel and cuff gator boy.

42:40.516 --> 42:41.642
Go on.

42:42.310 --> 42:44.519
Come on. Give me your hand, stupid.

42:49.067 --> 42:51.235
You don't need to say anything.

42:51.319 --> 42:53.403
I swear to God, Raylan,
I didn't know he was coming.

42:53.488 --> 42:54.988
I believe you.

42:57.033 --> 42:58.909
No shotguns allowed in this dining room.

43:01.287 --> 43:02.454
Toss it outside.

43:03.373 --> 43:04.665
Go on.

43:11.673 --> 43:16.260
Ava, why don't you go in the kitchen,
maybe watch some TV or something?

43:17.679 --> 43:18.762
Go on.

43:21.599 --> 43:23.558
Well, come on in.

43:23.643 --> 43:26.270
Come on in. Sit down. Help yourself.

43:26.813 --> 43:28.105
Raylan!

43:31.943 --> 43:33.860
The gravy ain't bad.

43:34.779 --> 43:39.408
I mean, it ain't like your mama
used to make it, but it never is, is it?

43:40.660 --> 43:45.455
Let me ask you something.
When you shot that gun thug in Miami,

43:45.540 --> 43:49.126
- was there food on the table, like this?
- There was.

43:49.961 --> 43:52.629
Well, have something. Have a little chicken.

43:53.464 --> 43:54.965
And you...

43:55.591 --> 44:00.887
- Well, you had your gun. What kind was it?
- That time? SIG 226.

44:01.222 --> 44:04.141
And where was it?
Was it on the table where mine is?

44:04.225 --> 44:06.518
- It was holstered.
- Bullshit.

44:07.061 --> 44:08.228
It was holstered.

44:10.148 --> 44:12.858
- And where was his?
- Under the table.

44:14.527 --> 44:17.779
And what did he have?
What kind of piece, I mean?

44:17.864 --> 44:19.489
I don't recall.

44:20.116 --> 44:21.783
Well, how did you know when to pull?

44:22.368 --> 44:23.493
He went first.

44:23.745 --> 44:28.373
And you gave this gun thug
24 hours to get out of town.

44:29.250 --> 44:32.461
Now, was the time up when you shot him?

44:33.087 --> 44:34.629
Pretty close.

44:35.965 --> 44:39.301
Well, how much time
do you think you've got left?

44:39.802 --> 44:43.764
- I thought I had till noon tomorrow.
- Well, what if I said it was right now?

44:44.682 --> 44:47.768
I mean, unless, of course,
you wanna finish that chicken leg.

44:49.687 --> 44:53.106
Well, I mean, you can call it off.
I mean, I don't mind.

44:53.191 --> 44:55.609
Well, if you're gonna keep after me, Raylan,

44:55.693 --> 44:58.028
I figure we might as well just get her done.

45:03.701 --> 45:06.578
Your.45 is on the table, I have to pull.
Is that how we do it?

45:07.205 --> 45:11.875
Well, I appreciate that, Raylan.
Yes, I do believe it is my call.

45:14.003 --> 45:15.170
What're you packing?

45:16.547 --> 45:17.964
You'll pay to find that out.

45:20.134 --> 45:22.636
You've got ice-cold water
running through your veins.

45:23.846 --> 45:27.474
Well, should we just do us
a shot of Jim Beam,

45:27.558 --> 45:28.975
just for old times' sake?

45:30.686 --> 45:32.854
Ava! Get us a shot of Jim...

45:34.732 --> 45:36.024
You want to know what Bowman said

45:36.109 --> 45:38.777
when he looked up
and he saw me with his deer rifle?

45:39.028 --> 45:41.863
God damn, woman, you only shoot people
when they're eating supper?

45:42.031 --> 45:46.243
He had his mouth full of sweet potato,
he said, "The hell you doing with that?"

45:46.327 --> 45:50.372
- Ava, put the gun down, please.
- You want to know what I said?

45:51.207 --> 45:53.583
I said, "I'm gonna shoot you, dummy."

46:18.067 --> 46:21.361
You did it, huh? You really did. He did.

46:23.739 --> 46:26.533
I'm sorry. But you called it.

46:49.223 --> 46:51.475
Why'd you say you're sorry?

46:54.479 --> 46:56.855
Boyd and I dug coal together.

47:19.545 --> 47:23.757
At Glynco, didn't you teach those recruits
to aim for the heart?

47:50.868 --> 47:54.037
The toilet's broken. Use the one downstairs.

48:01.128 --> 48:06.091
- It's cold up here. You leave the door open?
- No, I did not leave the door open.

48:06.467 --> 48:08.093
Well, somebody did, and it wasn't me.

48:16.769 --> 48:18.270
Jesus Christ!

48:19.021 --> 48:20.689
Hello, Gary.

48:21.524 --> 48:22.607
Raylan.

48:25.945 --> 48:28.488
You almost gave him a heart attack.

48:28.573 --> 48:31.533
- Sorry about that.
- I told him if you were gonna shoot him,

48:31.617 --> 48:34.452
you would've done it six years ago
when I left you.

48:36.706 --> 48:38.248
What are you doing here, Raylan?

48:40.668 --> 48:42.919
I'm going to be working in Kentucky.

48:44.046 --> 48:47.090
- Working for the Marshal's office.
- Raylan?

48:48.634 --> 48:49.926
What are you doing here?

49:01.188 --> 49:03.773
I was in Nicaragua a while back,

49:04.900 --> 49:09.112
looking for this money launderer
named Roland Pike,

49:09.905 --> 49:13.700
the cartel's gun thug, Tommy Bucks,
looking for him, too.

49:13.784 --> 49:18.496
Bucks got me, took my gun,
put me in a car with some other man,

49:19.123 --> 49:21.583
drove us to some old coconut plantation.

49:22.376 --> 49:27.213
Then he tied the man to a palm tree
and asked me where Roland was.

49:29.634 --> 49:32.636
I told him what I knew. No sense in lying.

49:33.721 --> 49:38.600
And I guess he wasn't certain
he could believe me, needed to be sure,

49:38.934 --> 49:42.145
or he just wanted to impress upon me
how serious he was,

49:43.356 --> 49:44.856
but I watched as Tommy Bucks

49:44.940 --> 49:47.859
stuck a stick of dynamite
in that poor man's mouth,

49:47.943 --> 49:51.154
taped it so he couldn't spit it out,
lit the fuse.

49:55.076 --> 49:57.827
Next time I saw Tommy Bucks in Miami,

49:58.746 --> 50:02.374
I told him he's got 24 hours
to get out of town or I'm gonna kill him.

50:02.875 --> 50:04.209
Did you?

50:05.086 --> 50:06.294
Yeah.

50:07.004 --> 50:10.965
But he pulled first, so I was justified.

50:13.678 --> 50:15.387
What troubles me

50:16.806 --> 50:18.765
is what if he hadn't?

50:19.350 --> 50:22.977
What if he'd just sat there
and let the clock run out?

50:23.688 --> 50:26.106
Would I have killed him anyway?

50:27.858 --> 50:29.734
I know I wanted to.

50:33.030 --> 50:35.740
I guess I just never thought of myself
as an angry man.

50:39.745 --> 50:41.037
Raylan.

50:44.500 --> 50:49.379
Well, you do a good job of hiding it,
and I suppose most folks don't see it,

50:49.463 --> 50:53.717
but honestly,
you're the angriest man I have ever known.
