05:25.832 --> 05:26.900
<i>Tomaz?</i>

06:43.676 --> 06:46.179
Oi, why don't you lot
fuck off back home?

07:03.863 --> 07:04.865
First day?

07:06.099 --> 07:07.567
Watch your toes.

07:07.901 --> 07:09.670
It's dangerous work, man.

08:49.969 --> 08:50.971
Halt!

08:55.908 --> 08:57.677
Halt!

09:23.103 --> 09:25.705
Get out of here, now!

09:26.339 --> 09:28.075
Fire! It's everywhere!

10:20.225 --> 10:21.828
Who tied you up?

10:22.262 --> 10:25.065
Friends. It was a joke.

10:26.333 --> 10:28.235
How long
have you been here?

10:30.402 --> 10:34.207
I'm not sure. Two years?

10:44.184 --> 10:45.386
I had a bag.

10:46.219 --> 10:47.421
Speak to the orderly.

10:47.454 --> 10:49.123
She said there's
a message for you.

12:08.602 --> 12:12.840
Like the lamb,
he did return into the fold.

12:14.007 --> 12:16.142
Into the blessed light.

12:19.378 --> 12:21.014
I hope I got them all.

12:23.883 --> 12:24.884
Thank you.

12:29.388 --> 12:32.325
There are many like you
who seek refuge here.

12:37.464 --> 12:40.467
The war is over.
I could go back.

12:40.499 --> 12:42.202
Why don't you?

12:48.440 --> 12:49.877
Thank you for this.

12:51.610 --> 12:53.379
You're a philosopher.

12:55.214 --> 12:56.883
No, I'm a builder.

13:00.020 --> 13:01.021
Really?

13:02.922 --> 13:04.457
Is something missing?

13:08.627 --> 13:10.329
I had some money.

13:10.363 --> 13:13.434
Uh... I didn't find
any money, I'm afraid.

13:21.174 --> 13:22.175
Thank you.

13:26.613 --> 13:30.017
Forward is not
the only way, Tomaz.

13:32.352 --> 13:34.021
There are other roads.

14:01.147 --> 14:02.148
Come on.

14:36.148 --> 14:37.417
Magda.

14:38.550 --> 14:42.055
My dear child,
it has been too long.

14:42.088 --> 14:44.558
It has been a month, Sister.

14:46.225 --> 14:48.728
I told you., Magda.

14:49.695 --> 14:51.632
My work at the church...

14:51.998 --> 14:54.634
Yours is not the only
suffering, child.

14:56.036 --> 14:59.606
Anyway, I come bearing gifts.

15:00.607 --> 15:02.009
Who is he?

15:02.575 --> 15:04.744
This is Tomaz.

15:04.777 --> 15:07.080
He wants to help you,
don't you, Tomaz?

15:07.647 --> 15:10.183
You have no need
to fear him, my dear.

15:12.118 --> 15:13.353
It is time.

15:33.772 --> 15:36.409
Oh, you've made
your first mistake here, Tomaz.

15:36.609 --> 15:39.379
You'll learn not to refuse
Magda's cooking.

15:42.515 --> 15:43.650
It's meat.

15:58.330 --> 15:59.733
Did she eat today?

16:00.266 --> 16:03.036
Nothing past her lips all week.

16:03.836 --> 16:05.438
Something has upset her?

16:07.206 --> 16:09.275
She knows the end is coming.

16:14.214 --> 16:16.550
Magda's mother
lives on the top floor.

16:18.151 --> 16:20.253
Unfortunately, she's an invalid.

16:20.820 --> 16:23.757
She's very ill
and in great pain.

16:24.724 --> 16:26.493
Unable to leave the house.

16:27.694 --> 16:31.098
Magda is tasked with the sole
responsibility of her care.

16:31.131 --> 16:33.333
It is a tremendous strain.

16:33.666 --> 16:36.270
Especially as her mother
doesn't like Magda to...

16:37.270 --> 16:38.439
socialize.

16:43.843 --> 16:46.313
The Lord will take her soon.

17:02.795 --> 17:05.898
Peace, quiet,
home-cooked food.

17:05.931 --> 17:08.401
What more
could the bachelor want?

17:45.904 --> 17:46.906
How much?

17:49.308 --> 17:51.144
We don't need your money.

17:52.911 --> 17:54.314
Sure you don't.

17:55.981 --> 17:58.450
I told you,
didn't I? At no charge!

17:58.484 --> 18:00.320
If you just help a bit
in the house,

18:00.353 --> 18:02.456
'cause it's falling down
around their ears!

18:12.398 --> 18:14.168
I must go to her.

18:20.006 --> 18:21.608
<i>She doesn't want me here.</i>

18:21.641 --> 18:22.942
What we want

18:22.976 --> 18:25.679
isn't always
what we need, Tomaz.

18:26.011 --> 18:28.315
I won't go
where I'm not welcome.

18:32.951 --> 18:34.320
Fair enough.

18:35.721 --> 18:37.557
It's getting late. We should go.

18:37.924 --> 18:41.360
You... Fetch the child,
would you?

20:02.107 --> 20:04.310
We don't have
electricity.

20:04.544 --> 20:06.412
Only gas to heat water.

20:07.412 --> 20:08.748
No electricity.

20:09.248 --> 20:12.818
Mother, once her pain
was so great, she tried to...

20:13.352 --> 20:15.488
put her fingers in the sockets.

21:01.433 --> 21:02.435
It's stew.

21:36.701 --> 21:37.703
Mm!

21:42.575 --> 21:45.478
<i>I don't want you to wait on me.</i>

21:47.546 --> 21:49.516
<i>That's not why I'm here.</i>

21:49.548 --> 21:51.384
<i>Why are you here?</i>

21:56.956 --> 21:58.892
<i>To help you.</i>

22:01.661 --> 22:03.397
Mother won't like it.

23:46.164 --> 23:47.633
Run, if you like.

23:49.768 --> 23:51.036
I won't chase you.

23:55.674 --> 23:59.879
The nearest village
is two days' walk that way.

24:02.248 --> 24:04.217
But I don't think
you want to go there.

24:15.061 --> 24:16.129
Help yourself.

24:26.872 --> 24:28.274
If you're heading
for the border,

24:28.306 --> 24:30.008
you'll never get across.

24:30.042 --> 24:32.045
They'll shoot you the second
you leave the trees.

24:32.378 --> 24:33.580
Why even try?

24:39.384 --> 24:40.786
My daughter is there.

24:46.892 --> 24:48.929
They say a peace deal
is coming.

24:49.761 --> 24:51.030
That it's months away.

24:54.033 --> 24:56.670
You can stay here, wait.

24:58.136 --> 25:00.005
Then you'll be able to cross.

25:10.682 --> 25:12.285
My mother is a dentist.

25:12.918 --> 25:15.388
The Captain who came
with the first brigade,

25:15.421 --> 25:17.891
she did a good job for his caps.

25:21.227 --> 25:23.063
That's how I got sent out here.

25:24.396 --> 25:26.765
She didn't want you
to play soldier?

26:27.459 --> 26:28.795
They're gone.

29:10.154 --> 29:11.324
(door opens

29:20.399 --> 29:21.401
Breakfast.

29:23.001 --> 29:27.406
Thank you. Maybe later.
My stomach is...

29:28.341 --> 29:33.046
I haven't eaten a meal
like that in a long time.

29:34.513 --> 29:36.149
What do you usually eat?

29:39.183 --> 29:40.586
Don't really get hungry.

29:49.061 --> 29:50.263
What is that?

29:51.497 --> 29:54.400
We make it into tea.
It calms her.

30:09.213 --> 30:10.215
Mm.

31:33.664 --> 31:37.036
- Don't touch that!
- Look, I want to help you!

31:42.507 --> 31:44.576
Don't be like that.
It's natural.

31:45.311 --> 31:47.713
There is a real problem
with the water.

31:47.746 --> 31:49.415
I didn't ask you to come here.

36:02.401 --> 36:03.402
A rat?

36:04.736 --> 36:06.004
Rat with wings...

36:07.739 --> 36:09.342
it's a bat of course.

36:12.444 --> 36:13.879
You haven't seen one before?

36:14.212 --> 36:15.648
In the house?

36:17.482 --> 36:18.484
No.

36:19.417 --> 36:22.754
I spent one year in the woods.
I used to see them all the time,

36:22.788 --> 36:25.658
but I've never seen one
like this.

36:26.158 --> 36:30.395
Can you take it away, please?

36:32.029 --> 36:34.332
- Outside?
- Mm.

36:42.440 --> 36:43.442
Thank you.

37:27.051 --> 37:28.453
She beats you?

37:38.797 --> 37:39.899
She's in pain.

37:42.067 --> 37:43.569
That's no excuse.

37:53.678 --> 37:54.913
When I was young...

37:56.580 --> 38:02.488
I remember feeling all the time
that she didn't want me.

38:03.989 --> 38:07.093
That she would get away
if she could.

38:11.062 --> 38:17.069
And yet she fed me,
she cared for me.

38:29.513 --> 38:31.549
Are you going to care
for me too?

39:15.527 --> 39:16.896
Found it in the woods.

39:19.931 --> 39:21.434
Must be old.

39:22.734 --> 39:24.036
A women guard.

39:30.975 --> 39:31.977
An amulet.

39:33.745 --> 39:35.781
Perhaps she will protect me.

39:48.158 --> 39:49.160
Morning.

39:51.962 --> 39:55.234
I'm going to the market.
You want to come?

39:56.167 --> 39:57.636
What is that?

39:59.203 --> 40:00.872
Use this old thing.

40:09.915 --> 40:11.250
How long have you lived here?

40:12.183 --> 40:13.219
Many years.

40:14.986 --> 40:17.122
The house belonged
to a man we knew.

40:18.156 --> 40:21.093
But he left one day, suddenly.

40:23.761 --> 40:25.196
Did he leave it to you?

40:26.230 --> 40:27.700
I don't know.

40:30.701 --> 40:34.573
I guess maybe we find out
if anyone comes to take it back.

40:36.073 --> 40:38.276
Alright, love you.
You have a good day.

40:42.080 --> 40:43.148
These ones.

40:46.984 --> 40:50.122
And... this.

40:54.326 --> 40:55.528
This one.

40:57.995 --> 40:59.631
Mm.

41:00.899 --> 41:02.067
Do you like it here?

41:02.933 --> 41:04.002
I don't know it.

41:04.569 --> 41:07.573
This is as far as I've been
since the day we arrived.

41:12.210 --> 41:13.779
You never go out?

41:44.942 --> 41:46.611
What are you looking at?

41:53.752 --> 41:54.987
It's a love story.

41:55.953 --> 41:57.922
You can borrow it if you want?

41:58.556 --> 42:01.160
I've read it many times before.

42:01.527 --> 42:05.197
No thanks.
I'm not into romance.

42:05.864 --> 42:09.001
Men think romance is silly,
don't they?

42:11.069 --> 42:14.640
They think it's not real love.

42:16.107 --> 42:17.343
<i>But what is love?</i>

42:19.343 --> 42:20.345
<i>Sacrifice.</i>

42:21.680 --> 42:23.114
<i>Nobody's romance.</i>

42:25.450 --> 42:26.884
It's an offering.

42:30.020 --> 42:31.689
What do you write?

42:33.692 --> 42:34.927
In your room?

42:39.397 --> 42:41.333
I can hear you at night.

42:50.007 --> 42:51.410
It's my dissertation.

42:52.977 --> 42:54.212
For my doctorate.

42:55.814 --> 42:57.149
And what's it about?

43:00.250 --> 43:03.154
Philosophy, the study of ideas.

43:05.189 --> 43:07.225
I know what philosophy is.

43:13.497 --> 43:16.000
Dare to declare who you are.

43:17.801 --> 43:21.006
It is not far
from the shore of silence

43:21.939 --> 43:23.708
to the boundaries of speech.

43:25.076 --> 43:28.847
The path is not long,
but the way is deep.

43:30.848 --> 43:32.917
You must not only walk there...

43:34.919 --> 43:36.721
you must take a leap.

44:41.386 --> 44:42.855
You are bleeding.

44:45.056 --> 44:46.358
Do you see it?

44:47.457 --> 44:49.026
I don't see anything.

44:55.866 --> 44:56.868
This shell...

45:01.138 --> 45:06.111
In the old times, it was painted
on the sides of houses

45:06.143 --> 45:08.513
as a warning against evil.

45:11.582 --> 45:13.050
And in the war, they...

45:15.853 --> 45:17.189
They used it again.

45:21.926 --> 45:23.996
Did you kill people in the war?

45:36.506 --> 45:38.876
It's a sin to waste your life.

45:47.151 --> 45:51.123
If I were free,
I would dance every night.

45:52.556 --> 45:54.593
I would go to nightclubs.

46:10.674 --> 46:13.444
You've got to take pleasure
where you can.

46:14.978 --> 46:15.980
Right?

46:23.120 --> 46:25.289
Mama? Mama!

46:28.558 --> 46:31.430
<i>Mama!</i>

48:39.689 --> 48:41.692
There were wires in the wall.

48:43.227 --> 48:45.129
I thought I'd got them all.

48:58.609 --> 49:02.080
Are you shocked
to see her like this?

49:06.250 --> 49:07.719
It's not my choice.

49:11.122 --> 49:14.759
It has to be this way,
otherwise she harms herself.

49:18.296 --> 49:20.131
What is wrong with her?

49:21.098 --> 49:22.533
You don't understand.

49:23.734 --> 49:25.737
She used to be so beautiful.

49:41.819 --> 49:42.821
You see.

50:13.817 --> 50:17.122
Why didn't you tell me?

50:17.321 --> 50:18.756
This is crazy.

50:23.393 --> 50:24.796
Please don't go.

51:08.439 --> 51:10.674
<i>Why didn't you go with her?</i>

51:11.676 --> 51:12.677
<i>Your daughter?</i>

51:13.910 --> 51:17.915
<i>Her father took her
across the border to safety.</i>

51:17.948 --> 51:20.184
<i>He couldn't hide us
both in the car.</i>

51:31.596 --> 51:32.564
You're married?

51:34.598 --> 51:35.600
No.

51:37.567 --> 51:38.602
We divorced.

51:39.236 --> 51:41.605
Why are you still
wearing your ring?

51:43.774 --> 51:46.478
I put my ring back on
when the soldiers came.

51:47.444 --> 51:49.247
I thought it would protect me.

51:54.819 --> 51:56.587
You worked in the Town Hall?

52:05.529 --> 52:08.567
I had to get papers
for my university application.

52:10.835 --> 52:13.238
I waited an hour in that line.

52:15.272 --> 52:17.841
You never looked up
once from your work.

52:19.442 --> 52:22.647
I wanted you to look up,
but the whole time I was there,

52:22.680 --> 52:24.683
you never did.

52:31.721 --> 52:36.428
My daughter.
I always had to leave at 5:00.

52:39.830 --> 52:41.600
You never saw me?

52:46.803 --> 52:48.339
I don't remember you.

54:24.968 --> 54:26.337
You're back.

54:29.439 --> 54:30.874
The house needs work.

54:39.549 --> 54:41.618
Can you make her
some tea tonight?

54:42.620 --> 54:43.587
Why?

54:44.788 --> 54:46.757
I don't want to eat
alone any more.

55:32.669 --> 55:34.071
She's sleeping.

55:37.707 --> 55:39.443
I made cake too.

55:39.477 --> 55:41.980
Lucky I'm so greedy.

55:49.719 --> 55:51.656
Do you have any other shoes?

55:52.556 --> 55:53.558
Shoes?

55:54.991 --> 55:56.694
You can't dance in those.

56:04.734 --> 56:07.604
<i>Thank you.
Where did you get it?</i>

56:09.138 --> 56:10.874
<i>The house
is full of things.</i>

56:11.075 --> 56:12.743
<i>Very few of them are ours.</i>

59:26.937 --> 59:28.239
You are running.

59:29.172 --> 59:30.174
Why?

59:34.377 --> 59:37.347
You think I know nothing
of the world, you are wrong.

59:38.015 --> 59:40.984
The very worst troubles,
secrets.

59:41.986 --> 59:45.690
The deepest pains of existence
find their way into these walls.

59:45.723 --> 59:47.725
This is not a sanctuary.

59:48.392 --> 59:49.861
This is a crucible.

59:53.397 --> 59:55.165
You can tell me.

01:00:01.939 --> 01:00:03.174
I made a mistake.

01:00:06.210 --> 01:00:07.412
We all do.

01:00:10.279 --> 01:00:12.315
I tried to help someone.

01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:18.056
They got hurt.

01:00:23.393 --> 01:00:27.432
Maybe you need to go home.

01:00:27.631 --> 01:00:29.900
There are other ways.

01:00:31.902 --> 01:00:34.472
- I am afraid.
- There are worse things.

01:00:39.276 --> 01:00:40.812
Before your God...

01:00:42.111 --> 01:00:45.816
the Ancients, they didn't
believe that you could.

01:00:47.017 --> 01:00:48.018
What?

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:52.256
Forgive yourself.

01:00:53.223 --> 01:00:54.926
It wasn't yours to give.

01:00:57.227 --> 01:00:58.863
What do you believe?

01:01:53.850 --> 01:01:56.586
No, no, no, no.

01:01:56.620 --> 01:01:58.890
No. I can't.

01:02:02.326 --> 01:02:05.196
- What are you talking about?
- Please don't.

01:02:06.529 --> 01:02:09.167
Tomaz, what's wrong?

01:02:13.937 --> 01:02:15.239
Don't be afraid.

01:02:36.593 --> 01:02:38.196
She can see us.

01:02:41.531 --> 01:02:45.303
Mama, don't be angry

01:02:46.502 --> 01:02:49.873
I know it hurts,
but who will care for me

01:02:49.906 --> 01:02:51.875
after you're gone?

01:02:53.643 --> 01:02:54.846
Let go.

01:03:01.183 --> 01:03:02.185
Mother.

01:03:10.627 --> 01:03:12.163
The end is coming.

01:03:17.401 --> 01:03:18.870
I'll call the police.

01:03:19.236 --> 01:03:20.238
No!

01:03:22.004 --> 01:03:23.173
No-one else!

01:03:24.373 --> 01:03:25.375
Promise...

01:03:26.475 --> 01:03:27.510
Promise me.

01:03:28.245 --> 01:03:30.614
Swear it. Swear it.

01:04:43.085 --> 01:04:46.623
It's always like this,
around her time.

01:04:54.364 --> 01:04:56.000
I should have known.

01:05:05.642 --> 01:05:08.111
Jesus Christ.

01:05:24.627 --> 01:05:25.729
I have to.

01:05:26.730 --> 01:05:28.599
They're born with teeth.

01:05:43.747 --> 01:05:45.181
A demon.

01:05:48.685 --> 01:05:50.353
Do you know what a demon is?

01:05:52.388 --> 01:05:55.125
The demon's essence is evil.

01:05:55.426 --> 01:05:56.761
Pure evil.

01:05:57.428 --> 01:05:59.763
But evil isn't simply
an idea, Tomaz.

01:05:59.796 --> 01:06:02.098
Through its body,

01:06:02.431 --> 01:06:05.669
it delivers evil.

01:06:06.837 --> 01:06:09.607
It becomes tangible.

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:13.109
It bites.

01:06:14.277 --> 01:06:17.048
Magda is its slave?

01:06:21.384 --> 01:06:23.687
These creatures
can live centuries.

01:06:23.919 --> 01:06:25.355
They need to be cared for.

01:06:25.888 --> 01:06:29.325
They need... companionship.

01:06:34.663 --> 01:06:36.799
But it's nearing the end now.

01:06:36.832 --> 01:06:39.202
It is dying. Finally.

01:06:40.636 --> 01:06:42.439
So Magda will be free?

01:06:43.274 --> 01:06:46.444
No Master will let its slave
outlive it.

01:06:50.147 --> 01:06:51.614
This is my duty.

01:06:52.314 --> 01:06:55.752
Has been our duty
through the ages.

01:06:56.652 --> 01:06:57.654
Duty?

01:06:58.154 --> 01:07:01.158
Evil must be contained, Tomaz.

01:07:04.294 --> 01:07:08.799
So you gave her to that thing?

01:07:09.232 --> 01:07:11.634
I tried to make things
bearable for them.

01:07:18.542 --> 01:07:19.877
Why am I here?

01:07:21.611 --> 01:07:23.279
It is your destiny.

01:07:46.870 --> 01:07:49.205
You will protect her, won't you?

01:08:12.861 --> 01:08:14.230
You're back.

01:08:19.568 --> 01:08:20.571
Again.

01:08:25.341 --> 01:08:26.509
Why are you here?

01:08:27.143 --> 01:08:29.845
- To free you.
- And how will you do it?

01:08:32.715 --> 01:08:33.850
I will kill it.

01:08:34.283 --> 01:08:36.252
What if it kills you first?

01:08:36.987 --> 01:08:41.457
It's weak. Dying, she said.

01:08:42.591 --> 01:08:43.661
You're a coward.

01:08:45.929 --> 01:08:47.398
You don't know me.

01:08:53.769 --> 01:08:55.805
You know nothing about me
at all.

01:11:19.916 --> 01:11:20.918
Don't.

01:11:21.951 --> 01:11:23.554
Leave him be.

01:11:29.826 --> 01:11:31.729
We belong together.

01:12:00.456 --> 01:12:02.859
There's no escape.

01:12:10.567 --> 01:12:11.568
Tomaz.

01:12:13.670 --> 01:12:15.172
You have to go now.

01:12:19.908 --> 01:12:20.978
I will not.

01:12:22.479 --> 01:12:23.480
Leave us.

01:12:59.047 --> 01:13:00.451
What are you doing?

01:13:04.153 --> 01:13:06.490
You'll die out there
in the woods.

01:13:07.290 --> 01:13:08.792
Or they will catch you.

01:13:10.894 --> 01:13:12.796
Thank you for all you've
done for me.

01:13:17.733 --> 01:13:18.968
You're a good man.

01:13:34.283 --> 01:13:35.486
You can't go.

01:13:42.591 --> 01:13:43.594
Why?

01:13:47.663 --> 01:13:48.831
You need me.

01:14:04.212 --> 01:14:06.983
Don't run.

01:14:15.123 --> 01:14:16.126
Don't.

01:14:45.153 --> 01:14:48.157
- How long have I...?
- Two days.

01:14:59.135 --> 01:15:00.938
I failed you.

01:15:15.018 --> 01:15:16.886
I told myself...

01:15:19.988 --> 01:15:21.991
if I could free you...

01:15:24.693 --> 01:15:27.598
then I would have a right
to be happy again.

01:15:35.671 --> 01:15:36.906
Listen to me.

01:15:42.144 --> 01:15:43.779
There is something...

01:15:50.286 --> 01:15:51.888
inside me...

01:15:54.857 --> 01:15:56.926
and it's stronger than me.

01:16:02.698 --> 01:16:06.236
I have not always done...

01:16:09.104 --> 01:16:10.107
right.

01:16:17.112 --> 01:16:18.114
But...

01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:22.719
I'm a good man, Magda.

01:16:27.055 --> 01:16:28.658
I am a good man.

01:17:33.089 --> 01:17:35.192
<i>You slept like a baby.</i>

01:17:38.094 --> 01:17:39.895
<i>I didn't dream.</i>

01:17:42.230 --> 01:17:44.067
<i>You forgave yourself.</i>

01:18:36.251 --> 01:18:37.987
You'll feel better now.

01:18:43.425 --> 01:18:45.194
Better out than in.

01:18:46.127 --> 01:18:47.330
That's what they say, isn't it?

01:18:48.331 --> 01:18:51.334
Oh, yes, do you like it?

01:18:51.367 --> 01:18:52.903
Such a relief!

01:18:53.135 --> 01:18:55.971
Never felt I totally convinced
as a nun.

01:18:56.339 --> 01:18:58.241
I never quite got the...

01:18:59.942 --> 01:19:01.278
Couldn't get the walk.

01:19:04.313 --> 01:19:05.448
Who are you?

01:19:05.915 --> 01:19:10.921
Someone you're going
to get to know very well.

01:19:16.358 --> 01:19:17.960
What is happening to me?

01:19:20.295 --> 01:19:21.530
Let's have a look.

01:19:43.986 --> 01:19:46.223
As I said,
a demon's essence is evil.

01:19:49.492 --> 01:19:51.361
Why?

01:19:53.962 --> 01:19:56.265
I think you know the answer
to that, don't you?

01:20:32.134 --> 01:20:33.303
So...

01:20:34.636 --> 01:20:37.107
let's get started.

01:20:39.375 --> 01:20:42.511
I wonder who the lucky girl
will be.

01:20:43.479 --> 01:20:46.449
What do you think you'll be
wanting in your candidates?

01:20:47.183 --> 01:20:48.218
Candidates?

01:20:48.417 --> 01:20:50.185
Companion, of course.

01:20:57.626 --> 01:20:58.929
I want her.

01:21:01.063 --> 01:21:04.634
She has served her time.

01:21:06.535 --> 01:21:09.706
Anyway I thought you wanted
to free her.

01:21:09.738 --> 01:21:11.273
I want her.

01:21:16.479 --> 01:21:18.348
She is still taken.

01:21:24.153 --> 01:21:25.255
I want her.

01:21:27.322 --> 01:21:28.524
Well...

01:21:30.760 --> 01:21:32.696
you'd better go
and finish it then.

01:25:40.709 --> 01:25:42.912
<i>The house belonged
to a man we knew.</i>

01:25:47.416 --> 01:25:49.719
<i>But he left one day, suddenly.</i>

01:25:53.322 --> 01:25:54.623
<i>Where did you get it?</i>

01:26:04.433 --> 01:26:06.236
<i>The house
was full of things.</i>

01:26:07.036 --> 01:26:08.837
<i>Very few of them were ours.</i>

01:26:18.980 --> 01:26:20.382
<i>The shell...</i>

01:26:21.450 --> 01:26:23.987
<i>was a warning against evil.</i>

01:28:17.965 --> 01:28:19.901
<i>Welcome, Tomaz.</i>

01:28:23.871 --> 01:28:26.575
<i>Don't you find me beautiful
anymore?</i>

01:28:28.977 --> 01:28:32.547
<i>You used to find me beautiful,
didn't you?</i>

01:28:37.685 --> 01:28:41.556
Isn't this what you wanted,
Tomaz?

01:29:22.063 --> 01:29:24.032
It comes so quick.

01:29:25.267 --> 01:29:26.935
He was ripe.

01:29:27.603 --> 01:29:28.938
You chose well.

01:29:32.206 --> 01:29:34.576
They chose their own path.

01:29:37.112 --> 01:29:39.582
You had every chance, boy.

01:29:41.649 --> 01:29:42.884
Please.

01:29:48.657 --> 01:29:50.560
Ate well, didn't you?

01:29:51.227 --> 01:29:55.497
Well, now it's time to pay
for your meal.

01:30:30.098 --> 01:30:32.268
Don't be scared Tomaz.

01:30:35.037 --> 01:30:37.673
You'll make a wonderful mother.

01:31:32.126 --> 01:31:33.295
You sure you want those?

01:31:34.729 --> 01:31:36.598
I wouldn't feed them to a pig.

01:31:43.371 --> 01:31:44.573
Well...

01:31:46.407 --> 01:31:48.143
I fucking hate cooking.

01:31:52.346 --> 01:31:53.349
Okay.

01:31:56.885 --> 01:31:57.987
Tourist?

01:31:59.086 --> 01:32:00.221
Kind of.

01:32:00.554 --> 01:32:03.191
We didn't have any tourists
for a long time.

01:32:06.662 --> 01:32:08.197
But now they're coming back.

01:32:08.529 --> 01:32:09.831
That's good.

01:32:09.864 --> 01:32:11.300
Yeah, I guess.

01:32:19.140 --> 01:32:21.277
We've all got to move on, right?

01:32:27.014 --> 01:32:29.285
Forget and move on.

01:32:34.922 --> 01:32:36.058
Never forget.

01:33:28.477 --> 01:33:30.011
Eat up, baby!
