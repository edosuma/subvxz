00:15.280 --> 00:16.440
Mr. Brickner

00:16.480 --> 00:20.280
you're in here for your initial
appearance before the parole board.

00:20.280 --> 00:23.410
You entered a plea of guilty
to manslaughter in the second degree.

00:23.420 --> 00:29.360
The court imposed a term of seven years
four and a half of what you've served.

00:29.420 --> 00:31.260
Yes sir, it's correct.

00:32.330 --> 00:36.420
This involves an incident
occurring in February of 2002

00:37.300 --> 00:39.330
You are responsible
for taking the life of

00:39.331 --> 00:41.360
 one Matthew Reynolds.
Is that correct?

00:42.270 --> 00:44.240
Yes sir, it's correct.

00:45.310 --> 00:47.430
Are you sorry for your crime?

00:49.340 --> 00:52.400
There's no day that goes
that I won't think about the man

00:52.410 --> 00:55.440
but not the crime...the man.

00:55.480 --> 00:58.320
It's just takes a switch to kill a man.

00:58.520 --> 01:01.320
You can use a gun from a 100 feet away.

01:01.360 --> 01:05.220
Or you can poison a man dead
and never look him in his eyes.

01:05.430 --> 01:10.320
Taking a human life in your own two hands
is the most unemotional thing a man can do.

01:11.330 --> 01:13.390
It changes you in a way I can't really explain.

01:14.370 --> 01:16.460
Why don't you try?

01:19.310 --> 01:22.500
You don't just take away a man's life.
You carry it with you.

01:23.380 --> 01:25.400
It's yours forever.

01:25.480 --> 01:30.470
Every action, every movement
and every thought.

01:31.320 --> 01:33.340
It's not something you can shake.

01:33.350 --> 01:35.350
Not the best thing anyway.

01:36.360 --> 01:42.390
I see! So tell me if released how would
you spend your time on the outside?

01:42.400 --> 01:43.490
What are your plans?

01:44.470 --> 01:47.370
I'm gonna be a productive
member of society.

01:47.500 --> 01:52.460
Get a job. But first off, I've gotta
get right at the situation.

01:53.370 --> 01:55.270
I don't have a choice.

01:55.480 --> 01:58.340
Just gotta get right.

01:58.450 --> 02:00.310
I've read your files.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.510
You've been a model inmate.

02:02.550 --> 02:05.280
And I think you're a
reasonable candidate for parole.

02:05.290 --> 02:08.280
Congratulations, Mr. Brickner!

02:08.289 --> 02:11.280
It's my strong hope that you make good
with the rest of your life on the outside.

02:11.460 --> 02:14.260
Best of luck to you.

02:31.280 --> 02:33.270
Come to eight and talk to Mike, alright.

02:34.520 --> 02:36.450
- Brickner
- Brickner

02:38.420 --> 02:43.320
Sandbox an hour and don't ask questions
and hours pay cash, alright?

02:44.490 --> 02:49.230
Take that load up to eighteen and convict!

02:49.460 --> 02:52.370
Don't even think about fucking with me.
Can you hear me?

03:04.120 --> 03:05.390
Here's another.

03:09.520 --> 03:11.520
Hey!

03:11.520 --> 03:14.390
Were we telling you that your ass is a wonderland?

03:16.290 --> 03:19.450
- Hands off, okay.
- What's wrong? Right clothes for an eviction.

03:19.490 --> 03:22.400
You can't afford the price of the mission.

03:24.400 --> 03:27.430
- Are you okay?
- Yeah...touches me again.

03:28.400 --> 03:31.300
Hey, bar girl, let's go!

03:34.480 --> 03:36.470
Here we go.

03:44.350 --> 03:46.450
Would you spring that sweet little...

03:46.490 --> 03:48.480
Don't you fucking touch me!

03:49.490 --> 03:52.290
Would you apologize to the lady?

03:53.260 --> 03:54.290
I'm sorry.

04:19.350 --> 04:22.320
- What?
- You want a job?

04:33.470 --> 04:36.370
Brickner

05:02.460 --> 05:04.290
Is there a problem, convict?

05:15.280 --> 05:17.440
So, how's it been going?

05:17.450 --> 05:21.310
Well, I got a job.
I got two jobs, actually.

05:21.480 --> 05:24.470
Made me think...
eight hours a week is killing me.

05:30.330 --> 05:34.460
Your piss is clean, good job!
I'll see you next week.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.270
Come on, guys!

05:47.280 --> 05:50.370
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Come on!

05:50.410 --> 05:52.010
Hey baby.

05:52.010 --> 05:53.280
Is that him?

05:54.480 --> 05:58.250
Settle down.

06:06.330 --> 06:07.520
So what do you think?

06:08.430 --> 06:10.260
I think we'll see.

06:36.490 --> 06:39.460
Don't let the door hit you
when the good Lord spits you.

06:45.270 --> 06:47.260
See you tomorrow night.

06:59.380 --> 07:03.320
Hey I...saw what you did with these..
It was great...

07:03.350 --> 07:07.290
it was fantastic...Call me.
And you and I could make some money.

07:07.290 --> 07:09.380
We could make some real money.

07:12.490 --> 07:14.220
Thanks.

07:23.340 --> 07:25.330
Suit yourself.

07:50.300 --> 07:51.290
John.

07:55.340 --> 07:57.300
John Brickner.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.260
So I guess you got my letters.

08:20.260 --> 08:22.320
I mean, I never really knew coz
I never heard back from you.

08:22.330 --> 08:24.390
Yeah, John, I got your letters.

08:24.430 --> 08:27.330
There's a reason I wrote the parole board.

08:27.370 --> 08:30.300
I told them they should release you,
that you're sorry and that you want to set things right.

08:31.370 --> 08:33.240
But make no mistake!

08:33.270 --> 08:36.299
If it wasn't for you
my husband would still be alive.

08:36.309 --> 08:39.280
And if it wasn't for me
you'd still be behind bars.

08:40.450 --> 08:42.380
- Thank you.
- Don't.

08:42.419 --> 08:44.380
I didn't do it out of the good of my heart.

08:45.450 --> 08:50.220
I have another selfish reason.
My daughter Sarah is eight years old...

08:50.360 --> 08:53.230
and she'll probably won't make it to nine
because she needs a heart transplant.

08:53.260 --> 08:57.290
I have written letters to every major
donor organization in the country.

08:57.300 --> 09:00.230
And only one of them
would even consider her case.

09:00.270 --> 09:02.360
And I have yet to hear back from them.

09:03.270 --> 09:04.430
I'm truly sorry.

09:04.440 --> 09:08.240
I don't want your sympathy, John.

09:08.440 --> 09:12.310
I didn't get you out of prison so you
could move buildings supplies around all day.

09:12.510 --> 09:16.350
- You are gonna save my baby's life.
- How?

09:16.350 --> 09:19.250
You're gonna get her that operation.

09:19.290 --> 09:21.480
It costs $250,000 and that is money I don't have.

09:22.420 --> 09:24.480
Well, I got my parole...

09:24.530 --> 09:29.330
I'm not interested in what you got.
I'm only interested in what you can get.

09:29.530 --> 09:32.470
And I'm not asking you, John.

10:30.460 --> 10:32.360
There you go.

10:40.470 --> 10:43.370
Can't be that bad, can it?

10:47.410 --> 10:50.430
You know I've decided, it's time to count our blessings.

10:52.480 --> 10:54.470
My ass is a wonderland.

11:00.520 --> 11:03.390
Can I ask you a question?

11:05.430 --> 11:09.260
That guy that offered me a
job the other night. You know him?

11:10.400 --> 11:13.270
Yeah, Reno.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.460
You know where I can find him?

11:22.380 --> 11:23.370
Call.

11:27.350 --> 11:30.220
Oh, you gotta be shitting me, Farris.

11:30.250 --> 11:32.450
All you got is that ragged ass pair of tens.

11:33.520 --> 11:35.320
Send it.

11:35.360 --> 11:37.450
I have a flush. Bring it here.

11:42.260 --> 11:45.260
You know what. I'm out.
Good game, losers.

11:47.330 --> 11:48.490
Frankie.

11:49.340 --> 11:50.500
Looking for me?

11:51.310 --> 11:52.530
Yeah...

11:53.470 --> 11:55.370
He wants to talk to you.

11:56.410 --> 11:58.400
Were you serious about that job?

11:59.450 --> 12:01.380
So what is it?

12:04.320 --> 12:06.290
Come on, I'll show you.

13:28.270 --> 13:30.330
Spotter's name is Timmons.

13:30.370 --> 13:32.400
He represents the Holy Grail of underground fighting.

13:32.440 --> 13:35.270
His manager is this guy named Sharp.
He's a friend of mine.

13:43.250 --> 13:44.480
No, thanks.

13:44.520 --> 13:45.490
What?

13:46.520 --> 13:48.090
What? Are you afraid of that guy?

13:48.520 --> 13:49.390
I'm not interested.

13:49.420 --> 13:52.450
The guy's a lumberjack for
Christ's sake, some basic cable.

13:52.460 --> 13:56.190
He is not even quick to pick her up.
Are you telling me you're scared of a lumberjack?

13:59.270 --> 14:02.240
Do you know how much money you
could make beating that guy down there?

14:02.270 --> 14:03.260
Not enough.

14:03.270 --> 14:05.330
And with the right management,
Frankie, tell him how much.

14:05.340 --> 14:07.360
Six figures, easy, one fight.

14:07.410 --> 14:10.400
Six. Six figures. One fight.

14:10.410 --> 14:12.500
And all I gotta do is whip that guy down there.

14:13.480 --> 14:15.510
Well, you gotta earn that fight.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.380
Goodbye.

14:17.420 --> 14:20.250
Look, I know you're on parole.

14:20.250 --> 14:24.250
It can't be easy, being an ex-con.

14:24.460 --> 14:27.330
And when do you know when
I end up cracking your ass?

14:27.360 --> 14:29.420
Let's just keep it that way.

15:25.290 --> 15:28.310
Listen, I'm sorry about your situation.
I really am.

15:29.290 --> 15:31.380
I just don't see how I can help.

15:31.460 --> 15:33.320
Really?

15:34.430 --> 15:36.400
Yeah...I'm sorry.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.400
Nothing you can do, huh.

15:41.440 --> 15:43.490
Well, then.

15:44.410 --> 15:46.400
How the hell do you explain these, huh?

15:46.440 --> 15:49.470
You're singing a different tune
than you sang in prison, John.

15:49.510 --> 15:53.240
If there's anything I can do,
you just name it, I wanna help.

15:53.250 --> 15:56.240
I can make amends with these.
You know what?

15:56.550 --> 16:00.320
Will you get the fuck out of here?
Sighting you makes me wanna puke.

16:03.420 --> 16:04.360
Mommy?

16:05.260 --> 16:07.520
Go to bed, dear.

16:07.530 --> 16:09.430
Did I wake you?

16:09.460 --> 16:12.230
- I heard you yelling.
- It's okay, there's nothing to worry about.
Go back to bed.

16:16.440 --> 16:19.410
This is John.
He's a friend.

16:20.310 --> 16:22.400
This is Boomer.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.380
It's a good name.

16:24.380 --> 16:26.400
She's my friend.

16:27.410 --> 16:29.470
I bet he's a good friend too.

16:29.520 --> 16:31.380
She snores.

16:31.390 --> 16:33.440
Bed.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.400
Let me see what I can do.

16:56.280 --> 16:58.240
Would you lend money, I need a loan.

16:58.280 --> 16:59.860
Dewey, I'm telling you,
I could feel this one

16:59.861 --> 17:01.440
I could feel it.
I could feel it in my bones.

17:01.450 --> 17:03.510
Yeah, yeah. You ever heard of phantom pains?

17:03.520 --> 17:05.900
Come on, he's prime.

17:05.901 --> 17:08.280
You set me up on this. I'm
gonna double your investment.

17:08.319 --> 17:12.349
Ah come on, if this guy is as good as you say.
What the hell do I need you for? Right, Frankie.

17:13.290 --> 17:16.490
I mean, we know you are a piece of shit liability.

17:16.530 --> 17:20.400
Look around here. The shows are
lined with your busted dreams.

17:20.400 --> 17:23.430
The only reason I still got them
is coz nobody else wants it.

17:23.440 --> 17:25.460
You're wrong, Dewey. You did wrong.

17:25.470 --> 17:27.500
Listen to me, Reno.

17:27.540 --> 17:32.340
Your instincts are for shit. If they're any good
in the first place, you wouldn't have to come
to me for help. You would've known better.

17:32.350 --> 17:35.340
I heard that you and the Veltz we're facing.

17:37.480 --> 17:43.290
Okay, let's just clear this throat, alright.
I come telling you, this guy, this guy's a luck.

17:43.290 --> 17:46.260
Bullshit, I tell you what is a luck.

17:46.260 --> 17:48.325
These car-shaped
couplings I like so much.

17:48.326 --> 17:50.390
You bring them to me, I'll
make you a good price young man.

17:50.430 --> 17:52.420
Those are my daddy's couplings.

17:54.270 --> 17:56.460
Your soul is degenerate.

17:57.540 --> 17:59.530
Can I help you, folks?

18:11.420 --> 18:14.220
Brickner!

18:15.390 --> 18:18.260
Brickner!

18:19.460 --> 18:21.330
Brickner!

18:22.460 --> 18:24.290
Brickner!

18:24.330 --> 18:27.490
I told you to clean up the scrap
pile down there an hour ago.

18:28.340 --> 18:30.240
What is the hold up?

18:30.240 --> 18:32.330
I've been working on
the saw like you tell me to.

18:32.370 --> 18:34.240
Jesus.

18:34.270 --> 18:36.370
You ex-cons are all exactly the same.

18:36.380 --> 18:38.440
Do you hear anything I say to you!?

18:38.480 --> 18:43.420
I tell you what. Grab your shit.
And get out of here. You're fired.

18:43.450 --> 18:46.510
Do you hear that?
Fuck off!

18:49.290 --> 18:51.260
You're fired!

18:51.290 --> 18:52.450
Are you okay?

18:54.500 --> 18:57.330
Somebody call 911.

19:01.340 --> 19:05.330
Don't die on me, you son of a bitch.
Don't die.

19:05.370 --> 19:08.400
Come on!

19:15.520 --> 19:18.420
You saved his life, you know.

19:19.450 --> 19:22.320
By those giant hands of yours.

19:24.260 --> 19:27.230
Cracked seven of his ribs too.

19:42.240 --> 19:43.400
Atta boy, come on!

20:23.420 --> 20:26.410
Nice going fella, you won.
You won, okay.

20:26.450 --> 20:28.250
We got one more to go.

20:28.460 --> 20:33.390
Dickson wins.
Next fight Dickson vs Wolfey.

20:34.290 --> 20:36.320
Stop moving, okay!

20:37.400 --> 20:41.270
Alright, good news is you won.
Bad news is you got one more to go.

20:41.300 --> 20:42.390
Yeah.

20:42.400 --> 20:43.430
Would you hold still?

20:43.470 --> 20:45.270
We got five, five minutes.

20:45.270 --> 20:46.400
I don't feel so hot, man.

20:46.440 --> 20:48.270
Hey, I can't talk right now.

20:48.280 --> 20:50.470
Hey Reno, we got a fight or what?

20:50.510 --> 20:52.410
Look, he's gonna be ready okay.
Don't worry about it.

20:52.450 --> 20:54.440
- You got five minutes.
- It's fine.

20:55.250 --> 20:58.220
You heard that, five, we got five minutes.

20:59.390 --> 21:01.250
You're all set.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.250
- Alright, you ready? Stand up.
- Good as new, okay.

21:03.290 --> 21:05.350
Hands up, hands in the air.
Let's go.

21:05.360 --> 21:06.350
Ready.

21:11.370 --> 21:13.330
You got time for me now?

21:19.240 --> 21:20.400
Somebody want to explain the damn rules?

21:20.440 --> 21:22.430
Put it this way if you lose...

21:22.480 --> 21:24.240
- they don't pay you.
- Got it.

21:24.240 --> 21:25.370
Would you want my advice?

21:25.380 --> 21:26.350
Yeah, why not?

21:26.380 --> 21:30.320
Expect anything. It's not a fight to the death
but some guys they don't know when to quit.

21:30.320 --> 21:33.400
Look, all you need to know John is
that if you won't actually kill this guy

21:33.401 --> 21:36.480
you wanna make sure
he wishes he was dead.

21:36.480 --> 21:39.000
Come on.

21:41.230 --> 21:42.290
What's his name?

21:42.330 --> 21:43.300
We got a sub.

21:43.300 --> 21:45.230
You gotta forfeit, that's what you got.

21:45.270 --> 21:48.430
Hey, come on. My guy took a nap on me, alright.
Don't worry about it, you're gonna get your cut.

21:48.470 --> 21:51.300
Fine. Is it okay with you Wolfey?

21:52.270 --> 21:53.430
Alright, good enough.

21:53.440 --> 21:56.410
The fuck it is. I'm his manager, it ain't alright with me.

21:56.410 --> 21:58.470
Colin Powell, come on. I would do the same for you.

21:59.510 --> 22:00.410
Don't you owe me some money, man.

22:00.410 --> 22:03.380
- Look, Trini.
- Look, gentlemen, gentlemen.
Do we have a scrap here or not?

22:03.381 --> 22:06.350
Coz otherwise I'm gonna take a
mathlock at home with my name all over it.

22:06.390 --> 22:07.380
I want my fucking money, man.

22:07.390 --> 22:12.380
Trini, you're gonna get your money
as soon as my guy kicks your guy's ass.

22:12.390 --> 22:14.420
Listen, listen...

22:14.430 --> 22:18.230
I'll give your guy 3-2, now we
both know that's generous.

22:20.330 --> 22:21.490
Yeah, generous.

22:21.540 --> 22:24.300
Alright, let's get it on.

22:24.300 --> 22:28.260
- Alright, so what do we know about this guy?
- Nothing, alright, he's a pussycat.

22:28.280 --> 22:31.210
- He bites.
- Not if you bite back, okay.

22:31.240 --> 22:33.290
So just do whatever you gotta do

22:33.291 --> 22:35.340
to keep yourself out of him. Do some
jumping jacks or something, okay.

22:36.350 --> 22:39.320
Alright, fighters to the chalk line.

22:40.420 --> 22:43.360
Wolfey, you know the rules.
I'm assuming that you don't.

22:43.390 --> 22:47.380
The fight goes until one man
surrenders or is unable to continue.

22:47.390 --> 22:51.330
Blood flow is not a reason to stop
the fight, if you stop you forfeit.

22:51.330 --> 22:56.270
A fighter cannot start the fight with a
weapon in hand but found weapons are legal.

22:56.440 --> 22:57.490
Did you say found weapons?

22:57.540 --> 23:00.340
Well, with the exception of firearms of course.

23:01.510 --> 23:03.340
Any questions?

23:03.340 --> 23:04.240
No.

23:04.280 --> 23:07.250
Alright, fight starts when you hear the horn.

23:10.480 --> 23:13.420
You bite me chief, we're gonna be friends after.

23:18.460 --> 23:20.520
Come on, man in black.
Keep it up.

23:42.350 --> 23:44.410
Come on, get up, John.
You can't win on your back.

23:46.350 --> 23:50.260
Do some damage, John.
Goddamn, don't say he can't miss.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.450
Come on, damn it, get up!

24:14.510 --> 24:16.480
Alright, good job, good job, come on.

24:28.400 --> 24:30.520
Well done.

24:42.440 --> 24:44.270
Flick him out, baby.

24:50.320 --> 24:52.290
Come on, hit him.
Right in his head.

24:56.290 --> 24:58.450
Good job, good job, come on.

25:34.490 --> 25:35.520
Nice!

25:35.530 --> 25:38.500
- Yeah, I told you.
- That's my boy, John.

25:40.370 --> 25:42.270
Hey, where did you learn that finishing move?

25:42.270 --> 25:43.200
What finishing move?

25:43.240 --> 25:45.470
This, we might call it "The Bone Crusher"

25:45.470 --> 25:47.500
Let's hold on for that.

25:48.310 --> 25:50.240
Let's take a look at you, come on.

25:53.380 --> 25:56.280
I can't believe that son of a bitch bit me.

25:56.350 --> 25:57.510
How's the head?

25:58.350 --> 25:59.280
Is it okay?

25:59.320 --> 26:00.410
Clear vision?

26:00.420 --> 26:01.280
- No.
- No.

26:01.390 --> 26:03.480
Let's see that arm of yours.

26:04.460 --> 26:07.260
I'm gonna need to disinfect that.

26:08.330 --> 26:10.390
Hey man, did I win?

26:10.400 --> 26:12.260
Did you win?

26:12.300 --> 26:14.290
That's funny.

26:14.500 --> 26:15.530
Yeah, you won, man.

26:16.440 --> 26:18.270
I did, right?

26:18.310 --> 26:20.240
Caught him with that big right hand.

26:20.240 --> 26:21.430
How about it dude?

26:21.470 --> 26:23.240
How about a discount?

26:23.240 --> 26:24.400
Hey, what the fuck are you doing?

26:24.440 --> 26:27.240
He just gets his tired ass
motherfucker a happy sleep.

26:27.380 --> 26:29.470
Ain't you forgetting something, Reno?

26:33.290 --> 26:35.280
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah.

26:37.360 --> 26:40.290
You know, I think what Reno was trying to say...

26:40.290 --> 26:41.520
is gotta give action together.

26:41.530 --> 26:43.390
You got your purse money?

26:43.430 --> 26:44.450
Yeah.

26:44.460 --> 26:47.260
Better to have your own than to borrow.

26:47.300 --> 26:48.530
Appreciate it.

26:48.540 --> 26:50.400
Hey, big man...

26:50.400 --> 26:52.460
it is time to celebrate.

26:52.510 --> 26:54.440
I'd go for that.

26:57.310 --> 26:58.400
Are you keeping out of trouble?

26:58.450 --> 27:00.240
Yes, sir.

27:00.280 --> 27:01.370
What else?

27:01.450 --> 27:03.470
I got fired from my job.

27:06.290 --> 27:07.250
Really?

27:07.250 --> 27:10.380
Yeah, it's a long story and I'm gonna
be looking for another one, so don't worry.

27:11.290 --> 27:12.450
Do I look worried to you?

27:13.460 --> 27:17.400
The piss is clean. Good.
Now, get out of here.

27:50.430 --> 27:54.300
You have to keep tip-tap?
I like that.

27:54.430 --> 27:55.490
What are you doing in my room?

27:56.440 --> 27:58.460
Are you afraid I'm gonna steal something?

27:59.270 --> 28:01.430
Hey, Frankie.

28:03.510 --> 28:05.440
How much money you got, John?

28:12.450 --> 28:16.350
Keeping the money in your own vent trick.
I love that.

28:20.460 --> 28:23.260
How much money you think you got there, John?

28:23.260 --> 28:25.320
I wonder if you'll give me a second.
I'll count it.

28:25.370 --> 28:28.390
- 2200 and 17 dollars.
- 2200 and change.

28:29.440 --> 28:32.500
You could've doubled that had you
not given that wannabe a happy split.

28:32.540 --> 28:34.400
You're still whining about that.

28:35.510 --> 28:38.240
Let me explain how this works.

28:38.240 --> 28:41.300
Now, we put up the first money.
We usually wanna take all.

28:41.350 --> 28:44.320
And the side betting,
the Deacon he sets the art.

28:44.320 --> 28:48.380
Now, to get that Timmons fight,
we gotta go to his gas shop.

28:48.420 --> 28:51.410
And believe me, to do that
we're gonna need money.

28:51.460 --> 28:55.450
Now, you wanna make some scratch.
You wanna make some real scratch?

28:55.460 --> 28:57.360
Yeah, I know, we gonna
give action to get action.

28:57.360 --> 28:59.460
Amen, brother.

28:59.500 --> 29:02.370
Pack your shit, John.
You're coming to live with us.

29:02.400 --> 29:06.400
Drop that off the house.
Then we're gonna go see the Deacon.

29:06.410 --> 29:09.380
He's always in a good mood
first thing in the morning.

29:09.410 --> 29:10.380
I'm gonna pass.

29:10.380 --> 29:12.370
Why do you mean "you're gonna pass"?
We got the money.

29:12.410 --> 29:13.440
Not enough, you don't.

29:13.450 --> 29:16.330
You know, people saw that little
show your boy here put on.

29:16.331 --> 29:19.210
They're gonna wanna know, there's
decent money to be made if they win.

29:19.250 --> 29:21.350
Look, John here, is a good fighter.

29:21.390 --> 29:23.410
Now, we all stand to make
money on him including you.

29:23.420 --> 29:25.480
Short term maybe but
long term not so much.

29:25.490 --> 29:30.230
Look, with all due respect, Deac,
what are you? A hundred and ten years old?

29:30.330 --> 29:32.460
Now what is long term to you realistically?

29:33.230 --> 29:35.460
You got balls, I respect that.

29:35.470 --> 29:39.230
But you need to get your
goddamn ears fixed coz I said no.

29:39.270 --> 29:40.430
Reno.

29:43.410 --> 29:46.310
Step outside for a minute.
Let me talk to the Deacon.

29:50.480 --> 29:54.390
Yeah, let's go outside.
Give him a chance to talk.

29:59.530 --> 30:03.260
Look, you seem like a nice kid.

30:03.300 --> 30:07.260
But you're an unknown variable in this game.

30:07.270 --> 30:09.765
People aren't gonna wanna dance with you

30:09.766 --> 30:12.260
for a little money coz they know even if
they win, they're gonna take a beating.

30:12.310 --> 30:15.330
So what you're offering,
it's just not worth it.

30:15.380 --> 30:17.310
Well, if it just about the money then...

30:17.340 --> 30:20.310
Money is a problem, it's just
not the biggest problem.

30:20.450 --> 30:23.440
You're on parole, ain't you?

30:23.480 --> 30:27.202
You can lie to me if you want
but I can see it in your eyes.

30:27.202 --> 30:27.202
You got that hinky convict look.

30:29.260 --> 30:32.320
Okay, I'm on parole.
So what?

30:33.330 --> 30:35.320
Are you a religious man?

30:35.330 --> 30:36.300
More or less.

30:36.330 --> 30:41.360
Have you ever heard the parable of
the unforgiving slave like in the Bible?

30:41.400 --> 30:43.370
No.

30:43.370 --> 30:46.460
Well, in the parable of the unforgiving slave...

30:46.470 --> 30:52.310
the kingdom of God is likened to a king
who is trying to settle accounts with his slaves...

30:53.250 --> 30:55.480
Now, who does that old
son of a bitch think he is?

30:55.480 --> 30:58.280
It's not like he needs some money.
Goddman tight ass.

30:58.320 --> 31:01.310
He's just protecting his business.
I'm sure it's nothing personal.

31:01.350 --> 31:03.290
He said he'll set the fight if
we get the money, alright.

31:03.290 --> 31:06.350
It's not about that, man.
It's about respect.
You know, it's about me getting respect.

31:06.390 --> 31:08.390
Man, I've set up over a
million fights with this asshole.

31:08.391 --> 31:10.390
The guy should do it on principle alone.

31:11.260 --> 31:14.320
Hey, how many times have I told
you not to light up in my car, Frankie?

31:15.370 --> 31:18.430
I don't know, how many did I listen?

31:21.340 --> 31:23.370
Let me tell you something
about this town, John.

31:23.410 --> 31:28.510
The rain it does weird shit to people.
All that gray, it's fucking depressing.

31:29.250 --> 31:31.340
I'm beginning to see that.

31:32.320 --> 31:35.410
You know, what lies beneath all
that self-pity and hopelessness?

31:35.460 --> 31:36.320
What's that?

31:36.360 --> 31:39.260
Rage, John, fucking rage.

31:39.260 --> 31:41.450
People are motivated by rage and anger.

31:42.230 --> 31:44.420
They spend their lives eating shit.

31:44.460 --> 31:49.400
It builds up. They try to deny its existence,
it turns into cancer and migraines and ulcers...

31:49.440 --> 31:51.400
bunch of shit like that.

31:51.400 --> 31:53.240
What the hell does that got to do with me?

31:53.270 --> 31:55.470
You wanna win, right?
You wanna win?

31:55.480 --> 32:00.240
You're gonna have to tap into that.
Tap into it. I mean, you're good, John, you're good.

32:00.280 --> 32:03.270
But you're too fucking nice.

32:04.420 --> 32:08.510
Like all that time you spent in the clink.
Don't tell me you ain't pissed off.

32:08.520 --> 32:11.490
I'd be pissed off, I wanna
take me a fucking hostage.

32:14.530 --> 32:19.490
Nobody likes what they got, John.
Everybody wants what they haven't got.

32:20.400 --> 32:23.320
And you're just like
everybody else, John.

32:23.321 --> 32:26.240
No matter what you're telling
yourself at night to go to sleep.

32:26.510 --> 32:29.370
And we need money.

32:29.410 --> 32:32.240
So we gots to improvise.

32:36.480 --> 32:38.310
Reno.

32:39.420 --> 32:41.480
Reno, wait, no.

32:41.490 --> 32:44.250
Don't go in there, no.

32:44.290 --> 32:46.450
Big picture, Frankie, big picture.

32:51.230 --> 32:52.360
I'd give you five grand for them.

32:52.400 --> 32:55.370
- Five grand? Are you out of your fucking mind?
- Yeah.

32:55.370 --> 32:57.460
Those are my daddy's couplings.

33:02.280 --> 33:03.470
You're killing me here.

33:04.480 --> 33:07.210
Alright, fine.

33:07.310 --> 33:10.395
You're getting a good
price here, young man.

33:10.396 --> 33:13.480
But if I was you, I wouldn't
let Val know that you sell them.

33:13.520 --> 33:17.320
Coz he might take an interest.

33:17.360 --> 33:18.450
Well, he's not gonna find out, is he?

33:20.360 --> 33:22.230
Coz you're not gonna sell them, am I right?

33:22.260 --> 33:24.250
I doubt anybody make my price.

33:38.340 --> 33:41.400
Tell me something, huss...
You ever heard of a dog match?

33:43.250 --> 33:46.340
Big picture, Frankie, big picture.

34:25.429 --> 34:27.360
They don't let the dogs go, do they?

34:27.360 --> 34:29.330
No, that would be dangerous.

34:31.500 --> 34:33.400
It's like we're just in time.

34:34.300 --> 34:36.364
You know what, you guys
hang here for a second.

34:36.366 --> 34:38.429
Think about any bad things
the last time I was here.

34:39.310 --> 34:41.300
What the hell does that suppose to mean?

34:41.310 --> 34:43.429
I got it under control, I'm a manager, right?

34:43.480 --> 34:46.270
You trust me?

34:47.550 --> 34:49.520
Can I ask you a question?

34:49.520 --> 34:51.350
What?

34:51.520 --> 34:53.489
What am I doing with a guy like Reno?

34:56.360 --> 34:58.410
What did he pawn back there?

35:00.430 --> 35:02.520
Just something special to him.

35:06.470 --> 35:09.230
Look, he saved my life, okay.
I owe him.

35:17.280 --> 35:18.300
Nestor.

35:18.340 --> 35:22.280
You know what they say.
You lay down with dogs.

35:22.480 --> 35:24.420
Reno.

35:24.450 --> 35:29.390
I've heard you've paid up Trini.
Well, you must be here to give me my fucking money.

35:29.390 --> 35:30.320
Do I owe you money?

35:30.320 --> 35:34.020
Yayo, Jaime,
kill this motherfucker.

35:33.460 --> 35:36.360
Hold on, man, come on.
Nestor, come on, we're friends.

35:36.360 --> 35:38.330
We're old friends, we can work it out.

35:39.230 --> 35:43.230
Too late for that. You're a piece
of shit and everybody knows it.

35:43.270 --> 35:46.240
There's a long line of people
out there you owe money to.

35:46.240 --> 35:47.755
And I bet you every single one of them

35:47.756 --> 35:49.270
is waiting to see you
get what's coming to you.

35:49.280 --> 35:51.300
That's not true, Nestor.
People love me.

35:51.310 --> 35:52.300
My dogs will love you.

35:52.350 --> 35:55.210
Hold up!

35:55.250 --> 35:55.510
What's he owe you?

35:55.520 --> 35:56.480
What's it to you?

35:56.480 --> 35:58.250
- I'll fight for him.
- What?

35:58.280 --> 36:01.410
You let me fight for him.
I win, you let him go free and clear.

36:01.450 --> 36:04.290
I lose, he's lunch.

36:07.230 --> 36:09.220
What kind of bullshit deal is that?

36:09.260 --> 36:11.230
Well, if I lose then I'll also cover his death.

36:17.340 --> 36:20.500
Let him go.

36:20.540 --> 36:22.460
So what about sidebet?

36:23.380 --> 36:25.945
You ask for a lot, amigo.

36:25.946 --> 36:28.510
I should kill that
motherfucker. Now, you wanna bet.

36:28.550 --> 36:30.240
How much?

36:30.250 --> 36:31.440
Two thousand.

36:31.450 --> 36:35.320
- That's all? Forget it, go...
- Ten thousand.

36:39.260 --> 36:40.320
Show me the cash.

36:40.360 --> 36:42.450
Here.

36:48.370 --> 36:50.360
Ten minutes. Get ready.

37:07.490 --> 37:09.350
Come on, John.

37:10.490 --> 37:11.460
Get up, John.

37:12.290 --> 37:14.490
Look at his triceps, they're made up of Jell-o.

37:15.260 --> 37:17.320
Come on, John, you got it.
He's nothing.

37:17.360 --> 37:19.490
He's nothing, he can't fight sleep.

37:19.530 --> 37:23.260
He's fat. He's just a big fat ass fatty.

37:23.300 --> 37:24.900
I bet his mom has got
a grandular problem.

37:24.901 --> 37:26.500
Well, you give him a treadmill
for Christmas, come on.

37:26.510 --> 37:29.410
She called you biscuit.

37:29.411 --> 37:32.310
Let me go, fuck me, no biscuit.
Fuck you fat ass, man, what?

37:36.520 --> 37:41.510
Atta boy, John, you gotta win.

37:48.460 --> 37:50.330
Get up, John.

38:15.450 --> 38:17.320
Nestor.

38:22.430 --> 38:25.360
Seventeen grand, it's go time.

38:25.400 --> 38:27.365
We talk to the Deacon.

38:27.366 --> 38:29.330
See if we can get started right
away then you go with that, big man.

38:35.270 --> 38:36.400
Who's Veronica?

38:48.490 --> 38:50.510
Thanks for coming.

38:52.530 --> 38:56.290
She was okay for most of the day, just tired.

38:56.330 --> 38:58.460
And she collapsed.

38:58.530 --> 39:01.300
I'm working on something.

39:01.300 --> 39:04.290
Is there some kind of way
we can give them a downpayment?

39:05.540 --> 39:07.510
At least she had medicard.

39:08.270 --> 39:11.440
Yeah, well. It's a county hospital.
I don't have a choice.

39:19.320 --> 39:22.290
How are you holding up?

39:23.360 --> 39:25.450
Don't waste your energy on me, John.

39:26.490 --> 39:29.260
You know what you gotta do.

39:32.500 --> 39:35.330
You're flying blind, aren't you?

39:35.500 --> 39:38.270
You know, what's that suppose to mean?

39:39.440 --> 39:42.410
Veltz, it's a little money.

39:42.410 --> 39:47.350
Jesus Christ, Frankie.
I just got Nestor and Trini off my ass.

39:47.510 --> 39:50.280
Can I get a moment of some peace?

39:53.250 --> 39:55.240
You know what, John, isn't
like those other meatheads.

39:56.520 --> 40:00.360
Last time I checked, John Brickner
could take care of himself.

40:03.400 --> 40:06.390
He's just not another walking cash machine.

40:09.500 --> 40:11.230
What, do you like him?

40:15.310 --> 40:16.330
Well, you do, huh.

40:17.280 --> 40:18.240
You like him.

40:18.280 --> 40:19.240
Shut up.

40:23.280 --> 40:25.480
Well, he got that whole quality you like.

40:29.420 --> 40:31.360
He just seems like one of the good ones, okay.

40:31.360 --> 40:32.220
- One of the good ones?
- Yeah.

40:32.490 --> 40:34.250
Let me tell you something
about John Brickner.

40:34.260 --> 40:36.320
You just spent four years in prison.
You know what for?

40:38.230 --> 40:40.320
-And I'm serious, Frankie, you know what?
- I don't care.

40:42.270 --> 40:45.430
He choked a man to death.
With his own two hands.

40:46.340 --> 40:48.310
He looked him in the eye.

40:48.410 --> 40:52.430
And he strangled the life out of him.
Does that sound like a good guy to you?

40:55.480 --> 40:57.350
Does that sound like a good guy to you?

41:05.420 --> 41:06.390
But we need him.

41:09.530 --> 41:10.430
You trust me?

41:11.300 --> 41:12.230
You trust me?

41:20.370 --> 41:21.270
Okay.

41:47.330 --> 41:49.320
- Hey look, John, about last night.
- Forget about it.

41:51.370 --> 41:53.460
I really don't wanna forget about it.
You know we'll talk about it.

41:54.310 --> 41:56.240
I said forget about it, didn't I?

42:00.350 --> 42:01.400
Hey, John.

42:04.250 --> 42:05.240
Good luck.

42:37.520 --> 42:39.420
Come on, wrap this up.
We gotta go home. Let's go.

43:02.340 --> 43:03.500
Get him off your neck, John.

43:33.370 --> 43:34.360
You see that?

43:36.340 --> 43:37.270
That's my guy.

44:18.520 --> 44:20.210
Fifty four thousand.

44:20.490 --> 44:21.480
It's good.

44:21.520 --> 44:23.320
But it's not good enough.

44:23.460 --> 44:25.425
We're gonna need at
least a hundred grand.

44:25.426 --> 44:27.390
to even start a conversation
with Timmons guy sharp.

44:28.330 --> 44:30.390
Okay, good as new.

44:37.440 --> 44:41.430
John, I wanted to apologize
for other night.

44:42.340 --> 44:43.330
Don't worry about it.

44:43.480 --> 44:44.440
I'm serious.

44:46.280 --> 44:47.300
It's just noise.

44:50.250 --> 44:51.510
When I was inside...

44:51.520 --> 44:53.450
I did my best to control
my environment.

44:54.420 --> 44:56.390
One thing you can't control is noise.

44:57.520 --> 44:59.490
Prisons are loud noisy places.

45:00.460 --> 45:02.480
After a while, you'll learn
to just turn it off.

45:03.330 --> 45:04.300
Sorry.

45:05.300 --> 45:06.290
Sounds horrible.

45:07.430 --> 45:08.420
Goddamn it.

45:11.370 --> 45:12.340
The hardest earning.

45:13.310 --> 45:14.400
No one wants to fight him.

45:14.510 --> 45:18.200
Hell, they just don't want
their kneecaps daunted.

45:18.340 --> 45:20.400
Don't you worry, big man.
It's a good thing.

45:20.410 --> 45:25.250
Alright, they're just scared of you.
I'm gonna go make a few phone calls, okay.

45:44.500 --> 45:48.500
Who in there right mind would
wanna get into a scrape with you?

45:48.510 --> 45:52.240
You'd be surprised.

45:54.250 --> 45:57.270
How did you get involved
with that rascal, the Deacon?

45:57.520 --> 45:59.510
I keep asking myself the same question.

46:00.420 --> 46:01.410
Oh Deacon's alright...

46:02.290 --> 46:04.220
He's just like everyone else on the run...

46:04.260 --> 46:07.450
from one thing or another,
looking for something to believe in.

46:11.260 --> 46:12.320
Friends of yours?

46:16.270 --> 46:17.240
Unlikely.

46:35.290 --> 46:36.280
Hey, Frankie.

46:36.390 --> 46:37.290
Hey, John.

46:42.290 --> 46:43.280
How's the patient?

46:46.330 --> 46:48.390
Touch and go, for a while there
but I think we're okay.

46:51.500 --> 46:54.300
It's called the buried suture.

46:55.240 --> 46:56.230
Sounds like fun.

46:58.280 --> 47:02.210
It's supposed to close in dead space.
And I thought it might be useful in the future.

47:08.450 --> 47:10.280
Where's Reno at?

47:13.360 --> 47:14.520
He's probably at Trips.

47:18.360 --> 47:21.530
So how are you doing?

47:23.500 --> 47:25.300
Fine.

47:27.270 --> 47:28.400
Let me ask you a question.

47:29.510 --> 47:31.005
How come you never went to

47:31.006 --> 47:32.500
nursing school or became
an MD or something?

47:33.510 --> 47:35.380
I don't know what
makes you think I didn't.

47:38.480 --> 47:41.420
What? I'm gonna look
after people for a living?

47:43.290 --> 47:45.260
Guess, I can understand
when you put it like that.

47:45.460 --> 47:47.360
Healthy people, they take enough.

47:48.530 --> 47:50.430
Sick people take a lot more.

48:04.240 --> 48:07.300
Piece of shit, give me something.
Anything, Jesus Christ.

48:15.290 --> 48:16.310
Time to take a walk.

48:16.460 --> 48:19.390
Yeah, I like exercising, I'm just
right in a middle of a card game.

48:25.430 --> 48:28.370
Mr. Veltz wants his hundred fifty grand, Reno.

48:28.500 --> 48:31.490
It's all fine when you're making
payments but now you're late.

48:32.340 --> 48:33.270
Why are you late?

48:34.540 --> 48:36.520
You know what I told him?

48:36.521 --> 48:38.500
I said he doesn't have any money.
Why don't you just let me kill him?

48:39.310 --> 48:41.470
Now, we don't have to go
to the hassle of trying to collect.

48:42.550 --> 48:45.410
Mr. Veltz believes that
you can be motivated.

48:46.450 --> 48:48.420
He said we should hurt
the girl instead of you.

48:49.350 --> 48:50.415
Man, after all, she's the one

48:50.416 --> 48:51.480
with all the money when
we take you to death.

48:51.490 --> 48:54.390
I swear to God,
you fucking touch her.

48:54.391 --> 48:57.290
You swear to what? You don't
have the part to piss here.

48:58.030 --> 49:01.300
- And you have one week.
- I'll be needing more time than that.

49:02.370 --> 49:03.270
After that...

49:03.270 --> 49:05.200
We'll start negotiations
with your girl's fingers.

49:05.440 --> 49:06.500
I'm gonna need more time than that.

49:07.310 --> 49:10.370
Look, I'm gonna need more time than that.
Come on, I'm gonna need more time than that.

49:11.310 --> 49:12.470
Come on, I'm gonna need more time than that.

49:26.490 --> 49:27.420
What are we doing back here, Reno?

49:27.460 --> 49:29.480
I made a few calls, John.
Pulled a favor or two.

49:29.530 --> 49:32.400
You happy now?
We're all gonna die at the sea.

49:32.500 --> 49:35.430
Come on, I dig out that salty
old pirate like you would love this place.

49:39.300 --> 49:41.330
- What?
- What the hell do you think you're doing?

49:41.510 --> 49:43.440
Why are we doing
business with Nestor again?

49:44.380 --> 49:46.280
How else do you think I'm gonna pay back Veltz?

49:48.250 --> 49:49.370
We gotta go where the money is.

50:17.410 --> 50:19.380
What's Steroid freak doing here?

50:20.480 --> 50:22.280
John is fighting Yayo.

50:23.250 --> 50:24.240
I thought you said you
don't want that kind of action.

50:24.280 --> 50:25.480
We don't want that kind of
action, John. We need it.

50:26.520 --> 50:27.420
Alright.

50:28.320 --> 50:30.350
Look, you're gonn have to
look real ugly with this guy.

50:31.360 --> 50:34.330
You have to look for his
weakness and exploit it.

50:34.430 --> 50:37.880
I've known Nestor and Yayo for years,
you wouldn't know the look at it

50:37.881 --> 50:39.605
but Yayo has a weak jaw.
If he walks into one,

50:39.606 --> 50:41.330
he's gonna go down and he's
gonna stay there, okay.

50:41.470 --> 50:43.400
Goddamn, how hard can be a landed one?

50:44.470 --> 50:46.330
You'll find out.

50:46.510 --> 50:48.875
You should be thankful, it
isn't his brother Jaime, alright.

50:48.876 --> 50:51.240
That's one tough chico
Mexican. Let's go, come on.

51:00.490 --> 51:01.450
Brickner versus Yayo.

51:01.450 --> 51:05.390
Brickner coming off the
fight to Juan Yayo at 3-2.

51:06.290 --> 51:07.450
Just so we're clear, gentlemen.

51:08.460 --> 51:11.430
Drowning is the same as a forfeit.

51:11.887 --> 51:13.955
Let's get this over and done.

51:13.990 --> 51:16.797
- You know, I'm gonna rip you apart, right.
- Got it.

51:17.325 --> 51:21.442
And then, I'm gonna rip apart that
little girlfriend of yours right there.

51:24.093 --> 51:26.483
- Keep talking.
- Fighters touch them up.

51:59.415 --> 52:00.673
I gave you a warning, John.

52:03.770 --> 52:04.505
No!

52:05.465 --> 52:06.861
What did I tell you, bitch?

52:07.350 --> 52:09.290
- Stop it.
- We can't stop it.

52:11.390 --> 52:13.450
Hey John, how about a funny little rage.

52:14.260 --> 52:15.320
It's fun to rage, John.

53:09.378 --> 53:10.532
Hit me, man.
Let's go!

53:11.423 --> 53:14.300
- Have you got all your shots?
- Oh yeah, what do you think?

53:55.430 --> 53:58.420
This thing, Frankie here,
wanted me to stop the fight.

53:59.360 --> 54:01.860
- Is that true?
- Don't you worry, John. I wouldn't let her.

54:01.861 --> 54:04.360
Coz I believe in you.

54:07.240 --> 54:08.230
Brickner, congrats, man.

54:10.388 --> 54:11.868
Cheers, do a toast to John Brickner.

54:12.712 --> 54:13.371
Cheers.

54:13.661 --> 54:15.892
And his size 13 fist.

54:18.622 --> 54:20.470
That Timmons fight is right around
the corner. I can feel it.

54:20.924 --> 54:22.708
Right around the corner?

54:23.375 --> 54:25.461
That last fight should've
put us in a six-figure range.

54:27.511 --> 54:29.050
Then, what are we waiting for?

54:34.487 --> 54:35.476
Look, John.

54:35.511 --> 54:37.017
Sharp's pushing for a bigger purse.

54:38.158 --> 54:40.130
He's holding all the cards.
What do you expect me to do?

54:40.903 --> 54:42.550
The hell I would ask you guys
about what you can do.

54:43.316 --> 54:44.909
It's none of my business.

54:44.944 --> 54:46.833
But first, I have an agenda here.

54:50.350 --> 54:51.407
Hello.

54:54.074 --> 54:55.736
What?
Who are you?

54:58.318 --> 54:59.772
Veronica?

55:00.807 --> 55:01.905
Hello.

55:06.069 --> 55:07.218
Veronica.

55:10.011 --> 55:10.971
Veronica.

55:28.322 --> 55:29.306
Holy shit!

55:37.591 --> 55:38.699
Reno, start the car.

55:39.730 --> 55:40.722
Reno.

55:41.263 --> 55:42.521
- Reno, start the car!
- Come on.

56:11.468 --> 56:12.597
Hey!

56:15.985 --> 56:17.582
John, what's this all about?

56:20.803 --> 56:22.733
I mean, I know it's none
of my business. I just...

56:23.317 --> 56:25.914
She's the wife of the man that I...

56:26.853 --> 56:31.072
She wrote out to the parole board
and she got me out.

56:34.493 --> 56:35.958
That's nice of her.

56:37.933 --> 56:39.365
But she had a reason.

56:40.401 --> 56:42.165
Her daughter needs a heart transplant.

56:43.999 --> 56:45.541
The letter from the apartment.

56:47.498 --> 56:49.182
She wants me to pay for the operation.

56:49.930 --> 56:51.627
Obviously, that costs money.

56:52.642 --> 56:54.659
- Big money.
- Oh my God.

56:58.957 --> 57:01.695
- John..
- Hey, don't make me out to be some kind of hero.

57:03.725 --> 57:05.105
This is not enough.

57:06.220 --> 57:07.360
Yeah.

57:12.205 --> 57:13.542
Where is Reno at?

57:15.399 --> 57:17.444
He doesn't do this kind of thing.

57:18.696 --> 57:20.174
Yeah, I noticed.

57:20.865 --> 57:22.267
He kinda froze out back there.

57:23.247 --> 57:24.577
Look, um...

57:25.912 --> 57:27.637
Don't be too hard on him, okay.

57:31.141 --> 57:33.284
He is in his first trip down this road.

58:08.611 --> 58:10.024
Please, don't say anything.

58:12.074 --> 58:13.499
I saw the letter.

58:13.830 --> 58:15.258
Then you'd understand...

58:16.977 --> 58:19.059
No, I don't understand...

58:19.664 --> 58:21.432
Goddamn, I'm doing everything I can.

58:22.074 --> 58:23.126
You don't need to checkout.

58:25.289 --> 58:27.331
- You don't get to just give up.
- Don't you get it?

58:28.267 --> 58:31.005
My heart is a match.
They could've given her my heart.

58:31.040 --> 58:34.157
No, no, no, not like this.

58:36.488 --> 58:37.862
I can do this.

58:38.623 --> 58:40.002
Can you just trust me?

58:45.359 --> 58:46.827
I'll check back with you later.

59:01.638 --> 59:03.986
Dewey, my favorite handicapped.

59:04.488 --> 59:06.855
Come on, baby. I'm here to see
my babies, bust them out.

59:07.190 --> 59:09.985
Just a visit, mind you.
But I'll be back to take full custody soon enough.

59:11.011 --> 59:13.048
Reno, I got an offer.

59:14.406 --> 59:15.294
You got a what?

59:16.219 --> 59:17.784
On the couplings, I got an offer.

59:18.793 --> 59:19.996
You sold them?

59:23.928 --> 59:25.161
You motherfucker.

59:25.946 --> 59:28.069
You motherfucker.
I told you not to sell them.

59:28.104 --> 59:30.976
Oh, come off. And how am I suppose
to know you're gonna come back for them?

59:31.247 --> 59:32.461
You sold them, huh.

59:33.128 --> 59:36.635
I got an offer. A big one.
Cash. I took it.

59:37.336 --> 59:39.087
- Why?
- Who'd you sell them to?

59:39.605 --> 59:41.690
Look, you know I can't give
out that kind of information.

59:41.725 --> 59:44.396
- And even if I did, he paid cash.
- Hey, who'd you sell them to? Is it Sharp?

59:44.978 --> 59:46.066
Was is Nestor?

59:46.538 --> 59:48.155
Was it Nestor?
Was he in here?

59:50.972 --> 59:52.138
That's low down.

59:52.569 --> 59:54.107
That's some real scumbag shit.

59:54.142 --> 59:56.936
Yeah, well you might be right.
I mean, who in their right mind would sell

59:56.937 --> 59:59.731
something with such sentimental and intrinsic value.

01:00:00.801 --> 01:00:02.008
Fuck you!

01:00:02.809 --> 01:00:04.055
Fuck you!

01:00:05.825 --> 01:00:06.980
I'll fucking show you...

01:00:07.015 --> 01:00:08.076
I'll show you.

01:00:15.892 --> 01:00:17.041
How's she doing?

01:00:21.177 --> 01:00:22.463
She's alive.

01:00:26.017 --> 01:00:27.000
It's good.

01:00:27.203 --> 01:00:28.744
It's a tough thing, you know.

01:00:30.505 --> 01:00:33.310
Look, John. I know you got a lot
on your plate right now but...

01:00:34.496 --> 01:00:35.922
we gotta stay focused.

01:00:36.477 --> 01:00:39.061
- We got momentum.
- I don't wanna talk about this right now.

01:00:40.187 --> 01:00:41.510
Well, you tell me.

01:00:41.545 --> 01:00:44.880
- What does supposed to mean?
- Donor heart operations don't come cheap.

01:00:46.034 --> 01:00:48.708
You need for me to find fights.
The money-making kind.

01:00:49.907 --> 01:00:52.397
- Forgive me if that's what I do best.
- Reno.

01:00:55.334 --> 01:00:56.501
Nestor called...

01:00:57.453 --> 01:00:59.121
Jaime's looking for a revenge match.

01:01:00.202 --> 01:01:03.265
Do you want me to set it up or not?

01:01:10.052 --> 01:01:11.526
Set it up.

01:01:21.936 --> 01:01:23.186
So how's it going?

01:01:23.519 --> 01:01:24.919
It goes.

01:01:25.373 --> 01:01:27.242
Great.
Anything else I should know?

01:01:29.726 --> 01:01:30.899
Sure.

01:01:30.934 --> 01:01:34.297
I spent the last few weeks beating up
the men in this commission for money.

01:01:34.811 --> 01:01:36.656
It's taken a piece of me everyday but...

01:01:36.691 --> 01:01:39.640
I figured if I squashed the fellows
down hard enough I might just have

01:01:39.641 --> 01:01:42.589
enough saved up for a
complete mental breakdown.

01:01:42.589 --> 01:01:43.968
You know for when I retire...

01:01:45.208 --> 01:01:46.384
Good.

01:01:46.627 --> 01:01:49.103
The piss is clean.
I'll see you next week.

01:02:04.790 --> 01:02:06.204
Touch my breast and I'll kick your teeth.

01:02:10.053 --> 01:02:11.658
Looks like a lot more than we agreed on.

01:02:12.583 --> 01:02:14.154
It's a hundred fifty thousand dollars.

01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:15.802
Bullshit!

01:02:16.307 --> 01:02:17.527
We ain't prepared to go that high.

01:02:17.826 --> 01:02:20.478
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't think you
could put a price on family honor.

01:02:21.080 --> 01:02:22.833
Well in case, Jaime. How much is it for
you to take it up the ass tricks style?

01:02:22.834 --> 01:02:24.587
Hey, fuck you!

01:02:24.921 --> 01:02:27.225
Poppy, I can get the extra money.
I could whip this fool.

01:02:27.226 --> 01:02:29.529
Alright, enough of this bullshit.

01:02:30.094 --> 01:02:33.344
You both got a hard on for each other.
You wanted to fight, I set the fight.

01:02:33.598 --> 01:02:34.977
So stop crying.

01:02:42.276 --> 01:02:44.134
Fine. Fine.

01:02:45.110 --> 01:02:46.257
Let's go.

01:02:55.934 --> 01:02:57.212
Whoa, fellas.

01:02:57.482 --> 01:03:00.034
- Where is it?
- Today's your lucky day, I got your money...

01:03:00.281 --> 01:03:01.105
Great. Lead on.

01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:02.729
Well, I don't have it yet but I will...

01:03:03.364 --> 01:03:05.565
Hey man, hold on a second.
Look, I swear, okay.

01:03:06.883 --> 01:03:07.973
Look, I put all my money on the fight.

01:03:08.596 --> 01:03:10.023
Now, my guy he's a luck.

01:03:10.058 --> 01:03:12.988
He hasn't lost a fight yet, okay.
So just hang tight, you're gonna get your money...

01:03:13.404 --> 01:03:14.669
plus interest.

01:03:15.306 --> 01:03:16.222
Honestly.

01:03:16.257 --> 01:03:18.122
You better not be yanking us, hey.

01:03:18.748 --> 01:03:20.803
For this is gonna get very ugly.

01:03:25.844 --> 01:03:27.432
Where the hell have you been?

01:03:27.646 --> 01:03:29.159
Hello, Frankie.

01:03:32.330 --> 01:03:33.601
Still beautiful, I see.

01:03:37.203 --> 01:03:38.618
We'll be waiting there.

01:03:42.371 --> 01:03:44.167
Take the car and I want you
to get out of here, okay.

01:03:45.050 --> 01:03:47.374
- Now?
- Yeah, right now.
Can you just trust me?

01:03:48.189 --> 01:03:49.381
Trust me.

01:03:51.690 --> 01:03:53.246
- What is going on?
- Nothing.

01:03:54.426 --> 01:03:56.011
- What is going on?
- Nothing.

01:03:59.291 --> 01:04:00.461
What?
There's nothing going on.

01:04:02.813 --> 01:04:03.941
- You're lying.
- About what?

01:04:05.291 --> 01:04:06.534
Hey look, it's not like that.

01:04:12.902 --> 01:04:14.685
- What's going on?
- Nothing, man.

01:04:20.786 --> 01:04:22.234
What's going on with Frankie?

01:04:22.935 --> 01:04:24.169
She just a...

01:04:25.983 --> 01:04:27.202
She just wanted some air.

01:04:28.536 --> 01:04:31.589
- Are you serious?
- Nothing's going on. The fight, she just
needs some air. Come on, let's go.

01:04:32.624 --> 01:04:33.762
Come on, big John.

01:04:34.158 --> 01:04:35.934
Come on, John Brickner.

01:04:37.454 --> 01:04:38.403
Johnny.

01:04:38.913 --> 01:04:40.325
All that is for you, buddy.

01:04:57.212 --> 01:04:59.456
Alright, you big guys...

01:04:59.491 --> 01:05:02.663
Are you ready for some real ball busting?

01:05:05.178 --> 01:05:07.323
Fighters, the fight commences...

01:05:07.358 --> 01:05:09.017
when I give the signal.

01:05:09.522 --> 01:05:10.770
There are no rounds.

01:05:11.295 --> 01:05:13.731
No bells and no whistle.

01:05:13.987 --> 01:05:15.473
Good luck to both of you.

01:05:24.576 --> 01:05:26.182
Come on, John.

01:05:26.992 --> 01:05:28.295
He knows that he's dead, right?

01:05:29.030 --> 01:05:30.331
Oh yeah?
Says who?

01:05:32.661 --> 01:05:33.824
Come on, John.

01:05:35.578 --> 01:05:36.457
Get up, John.

01:05:39.987 --> 01:05:41.374
Get up, John.
Move, John, move.

01:05:47.438 --> 01:05:48.522
Come on, get up.

01:06:07.817 --> 01:06:09.251
Don't stop, John. Don't stop.

01:06:11.552 --> 01:06:12.826
Come on, get it up.

01:06:33.338 --> 01:06:34.970
My brother was weak, not like me.

01:06:35.471 --> 01:06:36.831
If you're begging me to stop...

01:06:38.166 --> 01:06:39.270
You're not likely...

01:06:39.305 --> 01:06:40.538
Come on, John.

01:06:43.979 --> 01:06:45.005
Come on, Johnny.
Get up. Get up.

01:06:50.132 --> 01:06:50.901
Come on, John.

01:07:00.078 --> 01:07:00.984
Go for the face.

01:07:06.148 --> 01:07:06.936
Go for the face.

01:07:09.855 --> 01:07:11.178
Whoa, Johnny.
Come on, put it up.

01:07:32.837 --> 01:07:34.971
- You ain't done yet?
- My bitch wife hits harder than that.

01:07:38.905 --> 01:07:39.868
Come on, John.
You got it.

01:07:59.841 --> 01:08:01.001
Stay down.

01:08:01.157 --> 01:08:02.212
Fuck you.

01:08:07.354 --> 01:08:09.959
- Come on, man. It's done, it's done.
- Talk to him.

01:08:13.409 --> 01:08:15.234
Please tell your man to stay down.

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:26.549
Come on, bring it John.

01:09:20.223 --> 01:09:21.252
I'm done.

01:09:21.287 --> 01:09:22.885
Whoa, we're done?
What do you mean done?

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:24.356
I'm done.

01:09:26.142 --> 01:09:28.124
Wait a second. What are
you doing? When are you done?

01:09:29.462 --> 01:09:31.218
We can't be done. It's a forfeit.

01:09:31.252 --> 01:09:32.849
John.

01:09:32.884 --> 01:09:33.956
John, John.

01:09:34.885 --> 01:09:35.902
Hey man, come on.

01:09:35.937 --> 01:09:39.005
Game's off, got it?

01:09:42.734 --> 01:09:44.629
- Wait.
- Leave me alone, Frankie, okay.

01:09:45.426 --> 01:09:47.006
- Leave me alone!
- It's okay.

01:09:47.341 --> 01:09:48.772
Nothing's okay, everything's fucked.

01:09:50.591 --> 01:09:51.714
I know.

01:10:03.781 --> 01:10:05.036
Frankie, come quick.

01:10:07.161 --> 01:10:08.437
Shit!

01:10:08.472 --> 01:10:09.778
Reno.

01:10:13.711 --> 01:10:15.069
Baby.

01:10:33.151 --> 01:10:34.951
I got it.

01:10:37.751 --> 01:10:38.868
Okay.

01:10:42.042 --> 01:10:44.030
Move.

01:10:48.111 --> 01:10:49.633
I got it.

01:10:52.973 --> 01:10:54.175
I got it.

01:11:08.811 --> 01:11:12.387
- You owe how much to this guy?
- About a hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

01:11:14.112 --> 01:11:15.922
Jesus Christ, why didn't you say something?

01:11:17.333 --> 01:11:20.572
What do you want me to say, John?
It's not your problem.

01:11:21.530 --> 01:11:23.050
You got your own problems.

01:11:24.711 --> 01:11:26.140
What the hell happened?

01:11:27.545 --> 01:11:28.876
It's not important.

01:11:31.333 --> 01:11:35.673
You know, it is important.
You can't keep protecting me, okay.

01:11:37.115 --> 01:11:39.358
It was my debt, it was me.

01:11:40.358 --> 01:11:41.805
Reno was just trying to help.

01:14:15.242 --> 01:14:17.146
Hell of a taxi service you got there.

01:14:21.617 --> 01:14:23.295
Straight to the point.

01:14:24.024 --> 01:14:25.153
I like that.

01:14:28.759 --> 01:14:31.412
Well, you got in a lot of trouble to
bring me here, so what's this all about?

01:14:32.171 --> 01:14:35.585
I could tell from our little chat so far
you don't have the first clue who I am.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.672
It appear however that you
you know my son-in-law.

01:14:41.041 --> 01:14:42.731
I believe you saved his life.

01:14:45.330 --> 01:14:46.359
Who? Sullivan?

01:14:46.970 --> 01:14:48.515
Yeah.

01:14:48.952 --> 01:14:51.006
My people tell me that he had
a massive heart attack

01:14:51.007 --> 01:14:53.060
and you stepped in and
brought him back to life.

01:14:55.568 --> 01:14:56.949
Did I forget anything?

01:14:56.984 --> 01:14:59.485
Yeah, just the part about him
being a giant pain in my ass.

01:15:00.368 --> 01:15:02.423
Well, that's true, he is a
giant pain in the ass.

01:15:03.342 --> 01:15:06.000
But of course, he married my
daughter and she loves him so...

01:15:06.966 --> 01:15:08.273
That's real nice.

01:15:09.796 --> 01:15:12.989
Bottom line is it would
appear that I'm in your debt.

01:15:14.151 --> 01:15:15.288
No shit.

01:15:16.445 --> 01:15:17.729
No shit.

01:15:19.961 --> 01:15:21.352
So tell me.

01:15:22.509 --> 01:15:24.684
What can I do for you?
You name it.

01:15:25.534 --> 01:15:27.042
I don't know, I'm not sure
you can help me at all.

01:15:29.999 --> 01:15:31.162
Okay.

01:15:31.724 --> 01:15:36.169
Well, here it goes. There's a little girl,
see, and she needs a new heart.

01:15:36.526 --> 01:15:38.196
But she's a little short on medical insurance.

01:15:38.616 --> 01:15:40.706
- How short?
- Try a number.

01:15:42.436 --> 01:15:45.417
The way this country treats the
poor and destitute is shameful.

01:15:46.386 --> 01:15:47.721
It's appaling.

01:15:47.993 --> 01:15:50.691
Anyway, I've been fighting in this
underground circuit to try to make enough money

01:15:51.065 --> 01:15:52.462
that will pay for her operation.

01:15:53.098 --> 01:15:54.970
- The heart transplant of hers.
- Yeah.

01:15:55.594 --> 01:15:57.787
It's about 250,000 on low end things.

01:15:58.328 --> 01:16:00.577
But if I get my hand on the purse
money on this big fight and I win

01:16:01.151 --> 01:16:01.773
I'll have enough.

01:16:02.382 --> 01:16:04.771
So what I'm really saying
is I need a 150,000.

01:16:11.336 --> 01:16:12.792
I know, right, it's crazy.

01:16:14.208 --> 01:16:15.618
But I had to ask.

01:16:16.282 --> 01:16:17.761
That's a lot to ask.

01:16:18.154 --> 01:16:19.808
Yeah, it is. There's an upside.

01:16:20.604 --> 01:16:22.121
You can make side bets on the fight.

01:16:22.562 --> 01:16:24.799
- And the last fight.
- Oh, I heard about your last fight.

01:16:26.809 --> 01:16:27.899
You did.

01:16:29.107 --> 01:16:30.755
So you know how it went down.

01:16:32.465 --> 01:16:33.876
Go on.

01:16:34.335 --> 01:16:37.788
This next fight if I get it just gonna
have me going off some pretty crazy odds.

01:16:38.269 --> 01:16:40.883
You make the side bet you can
make your money back and earn some.

01:16:42.838 --> 01:16:44.251
Mancin.

01:16:48.167 --> 01:16:49.797
You saw this man fight, right.

01:16:50.599 --> 01:16:51.647
Yes, sir.

01:16:51.682 --> 01:16:52.706
Wait a minute.

01:16:54.577 --> 01:16:56.120
Your name is Veltz?

01:16:56.438 --> 01:16:57.587
That's right.

01:17:00.084 --> 01:17:01.408
Well, Veltz Construction.

01:17:02.750 --> 01:17:03.871
Reno Polsen...

01:17:04.336 --> 01:17:07.377
- ...he owes you money?
- He owes me a considerable amount of money.

01:17:08.312 --> 01:17:10.189
Only that he would have
been able to pay me back

01:17:10.190 --> 01:17:12.066
if you hadn't walk away
from that fight last night.

01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:13.792
So you know I'm his fighter then.

01:17:13.827 --> 01:17:15.842
I didn't. Not at first.

01:17:16.497 --> 01:17:17.859
But yes.

01:17:18.171 --> 01:17:19.174
I didn't think it mattered.

01:17:19.769 --> 01:17:21.935
This matter is completely
separate in my mind.

01:17:22.422 --> 01:17:23.882
Well, not mine.

01:17:25.034 --> 01:17:26.317
What are you saying?

01:17:26.723 --> 01:17:28.589
Reno is a friend of mine.

01:17:28.624 --> 01:17:29.951
That's not it.

01:17:29.986 --> 01:17:32.019
Reno Polsen doesn't have any friends.

01:17:33.044 --> 01:17:34.257
I'm his friend.

01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:35.589
Oh, I see.

01:17:36.899 --> 01:17:38.400
Quite a dilemma.

01:17:39.791 --> 01:17:41.165
Well.

01:17:42.375 --> 01:17:44.078
I tell you what, Mr. Brickner.

01:17:44.871 --> 01:17:48.459
I always pay my debts,
I owe you a favor.

01:17:49.061 --> 01:17:51.095
And I'm gonna hold up
my end of the bargain.

01:17:52.050 --> 01:17:54.032
- Thank you, I appreciate that.
- Hold on.

01:17:55.363 --> 01:17:57.243
I'm not gonna solve both your problems.

01:17:57.657 --> 01:18:00.301
It's only fair, I'll leave it to you to decide...

01:18:01.088 --> 01:18:02.842
either I forgive Reno his debts.

01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:07.208
Or I'll stake you and your fight
for the little girl's heart.

01:18:16.744 --> 01:18:18.430
What happens to Reno if he doesn't pay?

01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:26.981
Clear his debt.

01:18:29.561 --> 01:18:31.004
You are sure?

01:18:32.941 --> 01:18:34.226
Yeah.

01:19:05.228 --> 01:19:06.371
Are you okay?

01:19:07.715 --> 01:19:08.805
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:19:20.095 --> 01:19:21.253
Are you sure?

01:19:26.077 --> 01:19:27.197
Yeah.

01:19:30.246 --> 01:19:31.385
Do you know...

01:19:31.420 --> 01:19:33.423
I was voted least likely
to succeed in highschool?

01:19:33.796 --> 01:19:35.517
I didn't know they voted on that.

01:19:37.046 --> 01:19:39.014
Well, it wasn't in the yearbook
if that's what you mean.

01:19:43.128 --> 01:19:45.773
But, I remember thinking, you know
what, I'm gonna show them...

01:19:46.765 --> 01:19:49.441
I couldn't wait to get out there
and make my mark in the world.

01:19:50.471 --> 01:19:52.911
A lot of years moved by
and nothing happened.

01:19:53.341 --> 01:19:55.306
I went to college with a blast.

01:19:56.122 --> 01:19:57.465
Then I got pregnant.

01:19:58.835 --> 01:20:00.469
I know, it's gonna sound really stupid.

01:20:02.117 --> 01:20:05.210
But she was my only real accomplishment.

01:20:06.875 --> 01:20:10.191
All those dreams that I had you know,
they really didn't matter anymore. I just...

01:20:11.662 --> 01:20:12.795
I was okay with that.

01:20:13.786 --> 01:20:15.303
Then I got married.

01:20:15.645 --> 01:20:17.201
Turns out to a real Grade A loser.

01:20:19.726 --> 01:20:21.151
Don't get me wrong.
That man loved me.

01:20:22.459 --> 01:20:23.680
He really did.

01:20:34.793 --> 01:20:36.656
I know that you didn't intend to kill him.

01:20:41.019 --> 01:20:42.409
I know it was self-defense.

01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:45.323
I know that.

01:20:46.348 --> 01:20:48.343
We're not the bad things that we do.

01:20:49.296 --> 01:20:50.978
We're not the good things either.

01:20:52.789 --> 01:20:54.136
We're just the start.

01:21:10.450 --> 01:21:11.856
Thank you.

01:21:35.277 --> 01:21:37.209
Well, come on in and have a seat.

01:21:47.773 --> 01:21:50.147
- Sit down.
- I need to ask you something.

01:21:52.033 --> 01:21:53.125
Me?

01:21:53.958 --> 01:21:55.574
Yeah, the story about the slave.

01:21:58.159 --> 01:21:59.357
What story?

01:21:59.799 --> 01:22:01.303
The Unforgiving Slave.

01:22:02.326 --> 01:22:03.830
That's not a story, kid.

01:22:04.449 --> 01:22:05.713
It's a parable.

01:22:05.748 --> 01:22:07.679
Alright, but why don't you tell me the story?

01:22:10.051 --> 01:22:11.843
When I made it, I can't
stop thinking about it.

01:22:13.138 --> 01:22:14.585
You are in parole, aren't you?

01:22:15.502 --> 01:22:18.622
You got that hinky look.
Anybody ever tell you that?

01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:20.561
Yeah, you told me that.

01:22:21.016 --> 01:22:22.331
- I did.
- Yeah.

01:22:25.177 --> 01:22:26.680
I'm a little confused here.

01:22:28.136 --> 01:22:29.206
I need some help.

01:22:30.092 --> 01:22:33.693
Trying to get enough money for
a heart operation of this little girl.

01:22:35.564 --> 01:22:37.263
It just seems that...

01:22:38.844 --> 01:22:40.312
everytime I get close...

01:22:41.948 --> 01:22:44.198
the heart seems to go in
the price of somebody else.

01:22:46.183 --> 01:22:49.442
Everybody's got that, kid.
Not just you.

01:22:50.946 --> 01:22:53.155
Some people give it till it hurts.

01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:57.356
What's the play here?

01:22:58.921 --> 01:23:00.502
You know kid, I..

01:23:01.375 --> 01:23:02.929
I ain't your priest.

01:23:04.238 --> 01:23:06.439
Maybe you should ask somebody else.

01:23:11.444 --> 01:23:12.725
Hello.

01:23:13.209 --> 01:23:15.555
God is weary of recruits.

01:23:17.696 --> 01:23:19.815
The awesome clouds.

01:23:21.087 --> 01:23:23.090
How about the chariot wheels?

01:23:23.125 --> 01:23:25.546
Pointing hooves of heavens of cavalry.

01:23:26.446 --> 01:23:30.504
Released in all their finest might.
All watches.

01:23:32.183 --> 01:23:33.643
One of the night...

01:23:42.517 --> 01:23:44.398
- So.
- Do you mind?

01:23:44.433 --> 01:23:47.530
- What's that?
- Do you mind looking me in the eyes when you talk to me?

01:23:51.301 --> 01:23:53.594
That's better. Now, you were saying?

01:24:08.318 --> 01:24:09.199
I can't stay here.

01:24:15.993 --> 01:24:17.638
I got a call John.

01:24:20.372 --> 01:24:22.254
I don't know what I can
do or say to thank you.

01:24:25.384 --> 01:24:26.841
You've been a great friend to me.

01:24:27.981 --> 01:24:30.324
I mean, we were friends, right.
We're friends.

01:24:30.920 --> 01:24:32.392
Yeah, we're friends.

01:24:32.945 --> 01:24:36.536
I know, I haven't really
been the best example.

01:24:37.562 --> 01:24:39.992
- of a friend.
- What am I suppose to do?

01:24:40.027 --> 01:24:41.357
Sign your death warrant?

01:24:43.813 --> 01:24:44.824
You know, um...

01:24:47.522 --> 01:24:49.453
I don't know, if you notice about me but

01:24:50.724 --> 01:24:52.193
I'm selfish.

01:24:53.950 --> 01:24:55.470
I don't really have a lot of friends.

01:24:56.187 --> 01:24:58.050
You know, fuck it, man.
I don't have any friends.

01:24:58.805 --> 01:24:59.777
Honestly.

01:25:00.613 --> 01:25:01.931
Frankie maybe.

01:25:03.227 --> 01:25:05.087
And only reason she's
hanging out with me is...

01:25:06.292 --> 01:25:08.087
out of some sick obligation.

01:25:08.122 --> 01:25:09.793
That's not true.

01:25:10.986 --> 01:25:12.839
You know, when I was laying
there bleeding after the fight.

01:25:13.101 --> 01:25:14.508
After my fight.

01:25:15.604 --> 01:25:17.481
I was thinking about Frankie and me.

01:25:18.540 --> 01:25:20.172
She thinks I saved her life.

01:25:21.598 --> 01:25:22.997
But the truth is, man...

01:25:24.178 --> 01:25:25.603
She saved mine.

01:25:27.588 --> 01:25:29.966
And I know the best thing
for me to do is to let her go.

01:25:32.315 --> 01:25:33.320
I'm just...

01:25:33.709 --> 01:25:35.184
I'm just too afraid.

01:25:37.117 --> 01:25:38.282
She loves you.

01:25:40.187 --> 01:25:41.403
What are you afraid of?

01:25:43.074 --> 01:25:44.417
I don't know...

01:25:44.837 --> 01:25:46.283
You have to think a lot about all these.

01:25:47.775 --> 01:25:49.124
My time in prison...

01:25:50.181 --> 01:25:52.089
there's a little girl that
needs a heart so badly.

01:25:53.492 --> 01:25:57.493
Yeah, all this time, I'm doing all these
to try to get them to forgive me for what I did.

01:25:59.588 --> 01:26:01.439
The truth is I need to forgive myself.

01:26:02.288 --> 01:26:03.922
Truth is I haven't.

01:26:05.950 --> 01:26:07.314
I don't know if I ever will.

01:26:10.128 --> 01:26:12.120
But everything else is
just background on this.

01:26:15.260 --> 01:26:16.391
Yeah.

01:26:18.382 --> 01:26:19.778
Reno, it's the Deacon.

01:26:24.028 --> 01:26:25.799
Just tell him, I'll call him back.

01:26:29.416 --> 01:26:30.788
It's about the Timmons fight.

01:26:31.368 --> 01:26:32.628
Frankie, there isn't a Timmons fight.

01:26:33.186 --> 01:26:34.562
Not according to him.

01:26:37.209 --> 01:26:38.154
Hello.

01:26:41.845 --> 01:26:42.684
You're leaving?

01:26:43.933 --> 01:26:45.263
Yeah, that was the plan.

01:26:52.968 --> 01:26:54.035
Thank you.

01:26:54.070 --> 01:26:55.214
Thank you.

01:26:58.012 --> 01:26:59.434
It's just a relief you know.

01:27:00.783 --> 01:27:03.322
When Reno took all my debt,
he gave me my life back.

01:27:04.623 --> 01:27:06.155
Now, you're doing the same for him.

01:27:11.028 --> 01:27:14.363
Did he tell you how it happened?

01:27:18.477 --> 01:27:20.479
- It's not important.
- No.

01:27:22.223 --> 01:27:23.687
I got to say it out loud.

01:27:24.344 --> 01:27:25.962
You're a big reason I'm able to.

01:27:28.629 --> 01:27:29.463
I...

01:27:29.926 --> 01:27:31.182
I belong to Veltz.

01:27:32.993 --> 01:27:35.324
It wasn't a relationship,
it was a business agreement.

01:27:37.435 --> 01:27:40.427
I was young, I was desperate,
and I needed the money.

01:27:43.167 --> 01:27:44.813
He needed a place to put his...

01:27:46.035 --> 01:27:47.718
dissatisfaction with life.

01:27:52.439 --> 01:27:54.467
After a while, I went numb.

01:28:00.776 --> 01:28:04.564
Reno and Veltz had business back then
and when he saw me, he knew what was up.

01:28:05.093 --> 01:28:08.040
He convinced Veltz to sell me to him.

01:28:10.142 --> 01:28:11.629
He wanted to free me.

01:28:13.171 --> 01:28:14.447
Meanwhile, I, you know...

01:28:14.686 --> 01:28:16.922
I've reached my limit
and I tried to end it.

01:28:18.794 --> 01:28:21.214
By the time that Veltz
delivered me to Reno

01:28:21.518 --> 01:28:23.530
I was...

01:28:23.565 --> 01:28:25.718
covered in blood and half-dead.

01:28:29.185 --> 01:28:30.871
Reno still paid him.

01:28:33.747 --> 01:28:35.586
And he never asked
for anything in return.

01:28:39.421 --> 01:28:41.190
The Deacon said that the Timmons fight...

01:28:41.225 --> 01:28:43.014
is scheduled for tomorrow
night that some guy...

01:28:43.049 --> 01:28:44.364
just put up the money for your fight.

01:28:45.085 --> 01:28:47.147
- What guy?
- Well, he didn't say.

01:28:48.785 --> 01:28:49.591
How much will I take?

01:28:49.626 --> 01:28:52.027
I don't know if he'll answer
that question, John but it's a start.

01:28:53.957 --> 01:28:55.034
So are we in?

01:28:57.621 --> 01:28:58.751
What do you think?

01:28:59.429 --> 01:29:00.863
Come on, one time
for old time's sake.

01:29:01.698 --> 01:29:03.400
Are we in or is it
all like dead and gone?

01:29:03.990 --> 01:29:05.160
Come on!

01:29:05.195 --> 01:29:06.851
Come on!
Big John Brickner!

01:29:22.826 --> 01:29:23.963
Come on, John Brickner.

01:29:50.219 --> 01:29:52.928
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:29:53.833 --> 01:29:54.666
Tonight...

01:29:55.144 --> 01:29:57.605
is a fight for the ages.

01:30:02.252 --> 01:30:04.309
A once in a lifetime brawl.

01:30:04.916 --> 01:30:07.846
For this, there are no rounds.

01:30:08.198 --> 01:30:10.952
And no bells to save you just
what the Good Lord gave you.

01:30:12.445 --> 01:30:13.569
Fighters.

01:30:13.967 --> 01:30:16.588
Toe to talk.

01:30:16.958 --> 01:30:18.863
Start the fight when I give the signal.

01:30:28.756 --> 01:30:29.596
Come on, John.

01:30:39.773 --> 01:30:41.082
- Come on, John.
- Get moving, John.

01:30:49.955 --> 01:30:53.233
Man, you gotta go at him.
Go at him.

01:30:53.295 --> 01:30:54.031
Come on!

01:30:55.506 --> 01:30:58.352
You can't win outside the ring, John.
You gotta take it to him.

01:30:58.387 --> 01:31:00.398
Take it to him.
Take it to him.

01:31:01.184 --> 01:31:02.173
What?

01:31:31.358 --> 01:31:32.089
Come on, John.

01:31:44.196 --> 01:31:46.170
Get up!
Get up!

01:32:25.852 --> 01:32:27.893
Get up, John.

01:33:13.476 --> 01:33:15.087
He's dead.
It's over.

01:33:41.385 --> 01:33:42.510
Holy shit.

01:34:07.087 --> 01:34:08.528
You mind if we finish this?

01:34:13.138 --> 01:34:14.898
Come on, everybody back
and give them some room.

01:34:56.253 --> 01:34:57.798
Go at him, John!
Go at him!

01:35:52.796 --> 01:35:55.224
Bravo, John!
Oh, who's the dead now?

01:35:58.390 --> 01:36:00.171
John, that was beautiful!

01:36:02.798 --> 01:36:03.524
Oh my God.

01:36:03.559 --> 01:36:05.000
John, unbelievable.

01:36:05.035 --> 01:36:07.197
Okay, not the bone crusher,
I'm not gonna call it that

01:36:07.198 --> 01:36:09.359
but I'm working on another one.
What do you think about "The Damage"?

01:36:10.012 --> 01:36:11.194
Can we call it "The Damage"?

01:36:11.824 --> 01:36:13.130
I guess I'll go for that.

01:36:16.124 --> 01:36:18.006
Congratulations, kid.
You did good.

01:36:19.895 --> 01:36:21.411
It was you who put up the money.

01:36:22.388 --> 01:36:24.075
Now, that's a laugh.

01:36:24.561 --> 01:36:26.776
That would mean I actually give a damn.

01:36:29.208 --> 01:36:30.486
Who'd believe that?

01:36:34.806 --> 01:36:36.399
Alright, I'll see you at the car.

01:36:44.616 --> 01:36:46.572
This is exciting.
I get to use that new suture.

01:36:47.134 --> 01:36:48.412
That's right, what's it called?

01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:50.544
The Buried Suture.

01:36:50.944 --> 01:36:54.210
- Oh yeah.
- Hold still, or you won't look pretty after.

01:36:55.605 --> 01:36:57.840
- Can I bet?
- No.

01:37:00.150 --> 01:37:01.384
Is Reno getting the cash?

01:37:01.768 --> 01:37:02.742
Yeah.

01:37:06.223 --> 01:37:07.672
You guys look good together.

01:37:08.749 --> 01:37:09.863
You know that.

01:37:14.616 --> 01:37:15.921
It's like we're all done here.

01:37:16.416 --> 01:37:17.869
Great.

01:37:22.411 --> 01:37:23.353
Don't move.

01:37:42.860 --> 01:37:44.124
Thank you.

01:37:44.741 --> 01:37:47.304
- If it wasn't for, I'd...
- Hey, you better get in there.

01:37:50.257 --> 01:37:51.432
Thanks.

01:38:03.122 --> 01:38:04.108
Everything okay?

01:38:04.413 --> 01:38:05.789
No, as a matter of fact. It's not.

01:38:06.781 --> 01:38:08.479
We got some unfinished
business to take care of.

01:38:08.734 --> 01:38:09.652
What's that, John?

01:38:12.464 --> 01:38:13.441
What is this?

01:38:23.046 --> 01:38:24.306
My daddy's couplings.

01:38:24.890 --> 01:38:26.173
You son of a bitch.

01:38:29.773 --> 01:38:31.081
John, I don't know what to say.

01:38:34.932 --> 01:38:36.027
Thank you.

01:38:38.863 --> 01:38:39.743
Good enough.

01:38:41.218 --> 01:38:42.536
- Hey, I got a call from Deac.
- Forget it.

01:38:42.571 --> 01:38:45.268
- It turns out he needs a new liver.
- That surprise me.

01:38:45.303 --> 01:38:47.446
Seeing as you got the miracle here.

01:38:47.678 --> 01:38:50.321
- That's out of the question.
- Have you ever heard the story
of the unforgiving slave?

01:38:50.724 --> 01:38:52.559
- Well, it's a parable not a story.
- Yeah, whatever.

01:38:52.594 --> 01:38:53.754
Tell me all about it.

01:38:53.789 --> 01:38:55.375
- Alright, you got a God right?
- Yeah.

01:38:55.410 --> 01:38:57.936
- Let's call him Jack.
- Jack?

01:38:57.671 --> 01:38:58.711
Yes, Jack!
