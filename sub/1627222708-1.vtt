Wait, 10 minutes?

00:44.150 --> 00:46.693
God, I should've just driven myself.

00:48.530 --> 00:49.973
Okay, it's perfect.

00:52.030 --> 00:52.883
This is perfect.

00:54.880 --> 00:56.112
Girls, breakfast!
- [Rose] Move!

00:56.112 --> 00:58.328
- Mommy is going away for the weekend.

00:58.328 --> 00:59.628
- Mom!
- Yeah?

00:59.628 --> 01:02.294
- She took my iPad.
- Hey, hey, hey,

01:02.294 --> 01:03.285
stop that now!
- It's mine!

01:03.285 --> 01:05.367
- Peter!
- Listen to your mother.

01:05.367 --> 01:06.693
- Peter!
- Rose.

01:06.693 --> 01:07.932
- She started it.

01:07.932 --> 01:10.216
- Hey, she's just a baby.
- I am not!

01:10.216 --> 01:12.700
- Okay, okay, gimme that, gimme that.

01:12.700 --> 01:14.223
Sit down, sit down please.

01:15.320 --> 01:16.580
There's no technology at the table

01:16.580 --> 01:18.910
because mealtime is sacred
goddammit right Peter?

01:18.910 --> 01:20.273
- Yep, rule number one.

01:21.740 --> 01:23.950
- Hey, hey, hey, no balls at the table.

01:23.950 --> 01:25.150
- Rule number 16.

01:25.150 --> 01:26.883
- I hate you mom.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.630
- Well, that's not very nice.

01:29.630 --> 01:30.860
I'm gonna take your photo now.

01:30.860 --> 01:35.690
Smile, great, that's good enough.

01:35.690 --> 01:37.880
Don't forget, we have that
meeting with the assessment team

01:37.880 --> 01:39.982
on Monday to have her classified.

01:39.982 --> 01:42.340
- Right, ADHD.
- Shh, she's right there.

01:42.340 --> 01:44.640
- Kids are over classified
and over medicated.

01:45.539 --> 01:48.063
- Rose, you forgot to
flush the toilet again.

01:50.762 --> 01:52.479
- Jenny!
- You know the rules.

01:52.479 --> 01:54.800
- Oh, please look, look who's talking.

01:54.800 --> 01:55.670
- Where is he?

01:55.670 --> 01:57.700
- How come mom gets her phone?

01:57.700 --> 01:58.600
- Gross, what is that?

01:58.600 --> 01:59.550
- [Rose] It looks like puke.

01:59.550 --> 02:01.620
- It's kale and it tastes delicious.

02:01.620 --> 02:04.170
Oh, he's here, okay.

02:04.170 --> 02:05.993
All right, I'm leaving.

02:10.526 --> 02:11.780
Do not forget to feed them, okay?

02:11.780 --> 02:12.690
- I got it covered.

02:12.690 --> 02:14.704
Hey, just enjoy your mommy weekend, okay?

02:14.704 --> 02:15.537
- It's not a mommy weekend.

02:15.537 --> 02:16.690
It's a work conference.

02:16.690 --> 02:19.600
- Well, work involves a
paycheck so just saying.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.206
- Well, that's exactly
what I'm trying to do.

02:21.206 --> 02:22.289
I'm just saying.

02:22.289 --> 02:23.706
Goodbye, goodbye.

02:27.010 --> 02:29.170
- You're right, that's puke.

02:29.170 --> 02:30.579
- Okay, mommy's going
away for the weekend.

02:30.579 --> 02:33.040
She's never, ever coming back.

02:33.040 --> 02:35.203
- Bye bye mom.
- Have fun!

02:37.640 --> 02:40.970
- Boarding pass is in my wallet.

02:40.970 --> 02:45.970
I have enough time to order a
salad before I board the gate.

02:52.380 --> 02:54.597
Okay fine, I don't need help, it's cool.

02:54.597 --> 02:56.670
- You Jeaneth, Jenny?
- Yes.

02:56.670 --> 02:58.860
- All right, I am mark with a C.

02:58.860 --> 03:00.550
- I know, I can read it.

03:00.550 --> 03:01.867
All right, I'm very late.

03:01.867 --> 03:04.950
(car engine roaring)

03:08.130 --> 03:13.130
- Relax, you'll get
there wherever there is.

03:13.200 --> 03:14.875
I got these delicious mints

03:14.875 --> 03:16.380
and lollipops.
- No, no, no,

03:16.380 --> 03:17.829
I'm good thank you, I'm good.

03:18.720 --> 03:20.470
- [Marc] Okay, so no.

03:28.275 --> 03:29.275
- Oh my God.

03:33.692 --> 03:37.524
All right, mommy's going
away for the weekend.

03:37.524 --> 03:40.441
Mommy's going away for the weekend.

03:42.337 --> 03:44.670
- So where are we flying to?

03:46.770 --> 03:48.270
- Vegas, yep.
- [Marc] Vegas.

03:50.120 --> 03:53.370
- For a conference 'cause I'm a blogger.

03:53.370 --> 03:54.623
- [Marc] Oh, me too.

03:55.510 --> 03:58.173
- Oh, well I've only been
at it for a few months.

03:59.910 --> 04:02.453
- Sweet, so what do you write about?

04:03.620 --> 04:06.130
- Motherhood and family, angst.

04:06.130 --> 04:09.223
You?
- Maoism, anarchy, angst.

04:11.210 --> 04:12.903
- Wait, where are you?

04:13.880 --> 04:16.060
Oh ways, okay 'cause it's rush hour.

04:16.060 --> 04:18.589
I should have left myself more time.

04:18.589 --> 04:19.423
Actually, I did.

04:20.260 --> 04:24.130
Wait, no, no, no, where are you going?

04:24.130 --> 04:25.610
- Yeah, you pushed pool, so.

04:25.610 --> 04:26.665
- No, I didn't.

04:26.665 --> 04:28.717
- Yeah, I'm picking up my next ride here.

04:28.717 --> 04:31.050
- God, I hate these stupid apps.

04:31.050 --> 04:33.217
Well, how much does it cost to switch?

04:33.217 --> 04:34.963
- You can't.

04:34.963 --> 04:35.920
- What do you mean I can't?

04:35.920 --> 04:38.550
- Relax Jen.
- Don't tell me to relax!

04:38.550 --> 04:39.850
My name is Jenny.

04:39.850 --> 04:40.770
And what is that?

04:40.770 --> 04:42.400
That weed, no.

04:42.400 --> 04:43.470
No, thank you very much.

04:43.470 --> 04:46.140
You don't, while you're driving?

04:46.140 --> 04:49.520
- I am straight edge so it's cool.

04:49.520 --> 04:52.323
Your choice, your body,
your body, your choice.

04:56.615 --> 04:59.992
(phone keys clicking)

04:59.992 --> 05:02.620
(phone message beeping)

05:02.620 --> 05:06.421
(phone keys clicking)

05:06.421 --> 05:07.970
(phone message beeping)

05:07.970 --> 05:09.470
- I'll relax when I get there.

05:15.246 --> 05:16.590
- Hi!
- [Marc] Kara?

05:16.590 --> 05:20.370
- Kara with a K.
- Oh, Marc with a C.

05:20.370 --> 05:22.950
- No way?
- [Marc] Way.

05:22.950 --> 05:25.763
- Well, not that anybody
asked, but I'm Jenny with a Y.

05:27.090 --> 05:28.203
- Wait, like Yenny?

05:29.130 --> 05:30.173
- Can we just go?

05:31.637 --> 05:33.010
Let's just go.

05:33.010 --> 05:34.502
- What's with her?

05:34.502 --> 05:37.630
(speaking in foreign language)

05:37.630 --> 05:39.260
- What are we listening to?

05:39.260 --> 05:42.150
- These are binaural beats.

05:42.150 --> 05:43.100
- Like, like, like?

05:44.661 --> 05:45.661
Where are you going?

05:47.230 --> 05:48.670
- LAX.

05:48.670 --> 05:51.240
- Oh okay, now I get the mood.

05:51.240 --> 05:52.113
I'm an intuitive.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.370
Where are you flying?

05:56.370 --> 05:59.350
- Vegas.
- [Kara] Oh fun, pool parties?

05:59.350 --> 06:00.650
- It's a work conference.

06:00.650 --> 06:01.863
- She's a mommy blogger.

06:03.765 --> 06:06.443
- Okay, gotcha.
- Do you?

06:07.510 --> 06:08.900
For both of your information,

06:08.900 --> 06:11.783
I happen to be an Emmy
award-winning news journalist.

06:13.100 --> 06:13.933
I mean, I was.

06:15.730 --> 06:16.563
- Whatever, you know

06:16.563 --> 06:18.720
how they say it's not like
you're carrying cancer.

06:18.720 --> 06:22.290
I worked in medical
research curing cancer,

06:22.290 --> 06:23.380
but I'm an actress now.

06:23.380 --> 06:24.780
And I'm going to Barry's bootcamp.

06:24.780 --> 06:26.480
My friend works there at the one in Venice

06:26.480 --> 06:28.970
so I get in for free and
I am very eco-conscious

06:28.970 --> 06:30.300
and I don't own a car.

06:30.300 --> 06:32.273
- It's all meaningless.
- Exactly.

06:33.690 --> 06:34.680
- Where are we going?

06:34.680 --> 06:36.159
- Oh yeah, this is our last stop.

06:36.159 --> 06:39.223
Go to North Hollywood, Jen
chill, we are going to get there.

06:41.120 --> 06:43.953
(mid tempo music)

06:57.390 --> 06:59.020
- Can we go now?

06:59.020 --> 07:01.810
- Yeah, if you're late, the
lock you out of bootcamp.

07:01.810 --> 07:03.363
Oh, look who's here.

07:05.407 --> 07:08.074
(Sean burping)

07:08.989 --> 07:10.720
(car door slams shut)

07:10.720 --> 07:13.660
- Sean.
- Oh my God.

07:13.660 --> 07:14.530
You gotta be kidding me.

07:14.530 --> 07:15.363
You gotta be kidding me.

07:15.363 --> 07:16.643
- [Marc] Hell is other people.

07:21.610 --> 07:23.710
- Seriously, I have been
puked on already once today.

07:23.710 --> 07:25.560
- Oh God, that is so gross.

07:25.560 --> 07:27.330
I thought I smelled that.

07:27.330 --> 07:28.163
I knew it.

07:28.163 --> 07:29.550
I'm really sensitive to that smell

07:29.550 --> 07:31.400
because I was bulimic in high school.

07:41.109 --> 07:44.020
- Thank you, thank you, thank you.

07:45.360 --> 07:48.500
Wait, wait, you gotta be kidding me?

07:48.500 --> 07:51.040
- First stop, Sean's going to Culver City.

07:51.040 --> 07:53.300
It's right before the airport.

07:53.300 --> 07:54.890
- Oh, oh, and then me, right?

07:54.890 --> 07:59.030
- No, no, not then her, then me!

07:59.030 --> 08:00.650
- Let's see what the app has to say.

08:00.650 --> 08:02.690
- I don't care what the app has to say!

08:02.690 --> 08:04.790
I'll start writing a very strong email.

08:04.790 --> 08:08.053
Remind me to write a very strong email.

08:12.480 --> 08:13.670
I'm gonna miss my flight,

08:13.670 --> 08:16.260
and the opening night cocktail party.

08:16.260 --> 08:18.420
- [Kara] Oh, you definitely
can use a cocktail Jenny.

08:18.420 --> 08:20.450
- Get out please now.

08:20.450 --> 08:22.823
- Did someone say cocktail?
- Seriously?

08:23.680 --> 08:26.243
- Jen, it's not her fault
you didn't leave enough time.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.990
- Yeah I mean, it would
have made a lot more sense

08:30.990 --> 08:31.823
to fly out of Burbank.

08:31.823 --> 08:34.460
- Fuck, goddammit!
- Don't!

08:34.460 --> 08:36.450
- Jen.
- I'm somebody's mom.

08:36.450 --> 08:39.676
- I gotta get to paradise.
(Jen screams)

08:39.676 --> 08:41.797
- We're gonna get you to the area port?

08:41.797 --> 08:43.340
- What?

08:43.340 --> 08:44.591
- He's got a gun!

08:44.591 --> 08:45.672
He's got a gun!
- What?

08:45.672 --> 08:46.879
- Oh my God, he's got a gun.

08:46.879 --> 08:49.227
- Guys, I'm not gonna use it.

08:49.227 --> 08:51.679
(Jen and Kara screaming)

08:51.679 --> 08:52.979
It's not even loaded okay?

08:55.220 --> 08:56.725
- Oh God.

08:56.725 --> 08:58.380
- Why do you have a gun man?

08:58.380 --> 09:00.390
- To kill myself.

09:00.390 --> 09:02.900
- Okay, wrong answer dude.

09:02.900 --> 09:04.320
- I'm not gonna.

09:04.320 --> 09:06.070
- Make sure the safety's on.

09:06.070 --> 09:09.870
- I tried to kill myself in 10th grade.

09:09.870 --> 09:11.620
I was bullied.

09:11.620 --> 09:13.910
- Look, Sam.
- It's Sean.

09:13.910 --> 09:14.950
- Sean, I'm sorry.

09:14.950 --> 09:16.360
It's gonna be okay.

09:16.360 --> 09:19.990
- It's fine, I can't I think.

09:19.990 --> 09:22.143
- Oh okay, that's good, that's good.

09:22.143 --> 09:24.003
- Hey, can you take me to paradise?

09:25.230 --> 09:27.160
Not on the app.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.973
My credit card's all maxed out.

09:30.009 --> 09:30.842
I have cash.

09:30.842 --> 09:33.083
I have $250 and that's all I got.

09:36.020 --> 09:36.943
- Cash rules.

09:38.440 --> 09:40.083
- Oh wait, Paradise, Nevada.

09:41.330 --> 09:42.913
- Yeah, fuck.

09:45.170 --> 09:48.970
- Sean, why did you feel
like you had to do this?

09:48.970 --> 09:50.683
I mean, do you mind sharing?

09:52.670 --> 09:55.083
- She went back to Paradise.
- Who?

09:56.169 --> 09:57.570
(cell phone message pings)
- Dawn and-

09:57.570 --> 09:59.680
- Sean, oh my God, I'm so sorry,

09:59.680 --> 10:01.370
but it's just my flight
is boarding right now.

10:01.370 --> 10:05.240
I don't mean to be insensitive, but Marc?

10:05.240 --> 10:06.690
- Hmm?
- How long would it take

10:06.690 --> 10:11.170
for you to drive to Paradise
or to Vegas right now?

10:11.170 --> 10:12.003
- Here to there?

10:12.003 --> 10:13.733
It's like five hours.

10:14.680 --> 10:15.797
- Five hours, yes.

10:15.797 --> 10:18.010
That's about five hours.

10:18.010 --> 10:20.440
Okay, I'm gonna throw in another $250

10:20.440 --> 10:22.460
and we're just gonna drive there.

10:22.460 --> 10:24.713
If we leave right now, I
can still make it there.

10:24.713 --> 10:25.546
I can shower.

10:25.546 --> 10:26.379
I can she mask.

10:26.379 --> 10:28.270
I will make it there in
time for the cocktail party.

10:28.270 --> 10:29.390
- Actually can I go too?

10:29.390 --> 10:30.950
- What?
- Wow!

10:30.950 --> 10:32.440
- No, what about Barry's bootcamp?

10:32.440 --> 10:33.930
- I didn't really wanna go.

10:33.930 --> 10:35.900
- I didn't wanna exercise today

10:35.900 --> 10:38.450
so that all works out for me.

10:38.450 --> 10:41.495
Can I like Venmo you guys my part?

10:41.495 --> 10:43.130
- Are you gonna take us or not?

10:43.130 --> 10:46.203
- Wow, what a freight train.

10:47.160 --> 10:48.980
So much to process, the ins and outs,

10:48.980 --> 10:50.770
the pros and cons and what have you's,

10:50.770 --> 10:52.103
the why's, the what for's?

10:53.740 --> 10:56.830
Yes, I'm answering in the affirmative.

10:56.830 --> 10:58.380
I will shepherd you.

10:58.380 --> 11:00.910
First, we just have to make a quick stop.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.760
- Okay, as long as it truly is quick.

11:02.760 --> 11:05.230
- Was I not clear?

11:05.230 --> 11:06.560
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.270
I need to sit in the front seat.

11:08.270 --> 11:10.650
I'm sorry, I get car sick easily.

11:10.650 --> 11:14.800
I'm always the designated
driver and no offense Sean,

11:14.800 --> 11:17.177
I'm really, really happy
that you chose life,

11:17.177 --> 11:18.927
but right now you smell like death.

11:19.920 --> 11:21.430
Is that okay with everyone?

11:21.430 --> 11:22.263
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

11:22.263 --> 11:23.096
- Great.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.283
- Salutations.
- Hello.

11:29.219 --> 11:30.052
(car door slams shut)

11:30.052 --> 11:32.280
- Yeah, please seat belts policy,

11:32.280 --> 11:33.846
preservation, you understand?

11:33.846 --> 11:35.932
- Okay.
- The light forces.

11:35.932 --> 11:38.490
- Start the car please.
- [Marc] All right.

11:38.490 --> 11:40.310
- [Jen] Drive, just drive!

11:40.310 --> 11:41.143
- I'm doing it.

11:41.143 --> 11:41.976
See me?

11:43.136 --> 11:46.070
I wanna just put this below there.

11:46.070 --> 11:48.900
- Okay, where are we going?

11:48.900 --> 11:49.733
What's this quick stop?

11:49.733 --> 11:53.580
- Lucas, yeah but your
contract said tickets

11:53.580 --> 11:55.653
to the premiere, that was explained.

11:55.653 --> 11:57.460
- It's on the way, it's on the way.

11:57.460 --> 12:00.700
- Yeah, I could talk to
him, but did you read it?

12:00.700 --> 12:03.730
- I get that between here
and there, but where exactly?

12:03.730 --> 12:04.686
- And I'll call the producer.

12:04.686 --> 12:07.400
Just read it, okay, thank you.

12:07.400 --> 12:08.273
- Boyle Heights.

12:15.770 --> 12:18.240
- Are you like a?
- Talent Agent, yeah.

12:18.240 --> 12:19.163
- I'm an actress.

12:20.220 --> 12:21.070
I have a manager.

12:22.330 --> 12:23.330
She doesn't do much.

12:24.218 --> 12:25.520
I'm thinking about firing her.

12:25.520 --> 12:26.859
- That's in East LA

12:26.859 --> 12:28.890
(speaking in foreign language)

12:28.890 --> 12:30.800
- Oh, that's actually
near The Staples Center.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.583
I had a call back there once.

12:33.590 --> 12:35.453
Yeah, but I didn't get the part.

12:37.197 --> 12:40.830
(cell phone message pings)

12:40.830 --> 12:43.143
- I just got a comment on my blog.

12:44.042 --> 12:44.990
- That's huge.

12:44.990 --> 12:46.500
- Comments are commerce,

12:46.500 --> 12:48.810
that is the first panel
I'm going to tomorrow

12:48.810 --> 12:53.633
after yes, desert yoga.

12:55.470 --> 12:59.200
I wrote a blog post about
taking my stepdaughter shopping

12:59.200 --> 13:00.908
for her first bra.

13:00.908 --> 13:02.760
(Marc laughs)

13:02.760 --> 13:05.480
Okay maybe, it's not how to
organize a sustainable protest,

13:05.480 --> 13:08.283
but it's funny, poignant and relatable.

13:10.610 --> 13:11.700
- I hate you.

13:11.700 --> 13:14.203
- It's a troll.
- It's my stepdaughter.

13:16.730 --> 13:18.130
How did this become my life?

13:19.110 --> 13:20.650
- I hate my mother too.

13:20.650 --> 13:21.550
- [Jen] Excuse me?

13:22.530 --> 13:24.593
- Let go ladies, come on.

13:25.480 --> 13:26.870
- She just cut me off last week,

13:26.870 --> 13:29.410
but what she doesn't
realize is that my phone

13:29.410 --> 13:32.670
is still on the family plan, ha ha.

13:32.670 --> 13:34.428
- Personal probs.

13:34.428 --> 13:37.178
- But you know what, problems
are still problems, okay?

13:38.400 --> 13:41.383
- [Marc] All right.
(mid tempo music)

13:53.750 --> 13:58.480
- I used to be on local
news on air, field producer.

13:58.480 --> 13:59.313
- We know, VME.

14:00.920 --> 14:03.253
- In Vegas actually, ironically.

14:05.210 --> 14:08.818
Anyway, back to the scene of the crime.

14:08.818 --> 14:10.697
- Did you kill someone Jen?

14:10.697 --> 14:13.390
- Ha ha ha, no, it's
where I met my husband

14:13.390 --> 14:14.340
and I got pregnant.

14:15.324 --> 14:16.760
My former self.

14:16.760 --> 14:18.733
- Oh, so who are you now Jen?

14:20.600 --> 14:21.580
Only you know.

14:22.480 --> 14:23.703
- Okay, that's the deep.

14:25.860 --> 14:27.323
- I went to Duke.
- You did?

14:29.893 --> 14:32.563
- Yeah, organic chem major.

14:33.730 --> 14:36.173
- I went to Berkeley.
- Middlebury.

14:40.850 --> 14:43.310
- Oh my God, I'm so sorry Sean.

14:43.310 --> 14:45.650
We've been so self-absorbed,
how are you doing?

14:45.650 --> 14:46.903
How, are you feeling?

14:48.960 --> 14:51.903
- Hung over, empty.

14:53.710 --> 14:56.957
- You were gonna tell us
why we were driving to-

14:56.957 --> 14:58.550
- Paradise.
- Paradise.

14:58.550 --> 14:59.960
- Yeah I mean, do you wanna talk about,

14:59.960 --> 15:00.830
I don't know if you want to talk about it.

15:00.830 --> 15:01.670
I like talking about things.

15:01.670 --> 15:02.630
I don't know if you are?

15:02.630 --> 15:04.163
- I fucked it all up.

15:05.800 --> 15:06.933
- All of what?

15:08.092 --> 15:13.092
- My life.
(upbeat music)

15:20.940 --> 15:22.490
I can't get her out of my mind.

15:23.360 --> 15:25.140
- Classic Leo.

15:25.140 --> 15:27.410
- That's so funny, I was
gonna say the exact same thing

15:27.410 --> 15:29.750
because of course I'm a Libra.

15:29.750 --> 15:31.670
- Of course, Pisces.

15:31.670 --> 15:33.860
- Oh, naturally.
- [Marc] Do you see it?

15:33.860 --> 15:35.320
- So naturally.

15:35.320 --> 15:36.250
Oh my gosh.

15:36.250 --> 15:37.870
You know what Jen, we know what you are?

15:37.870 --> 15:38.972
Do we know what you are?

15:38.972 --> 15:39.920
- [Marc] We know exactly what you are.

15:39.920 --> 15:41.093
- [Kara] Well, you are a Capricorn.

15:41.093 --> 15:42.322
- [Marc] Capricorn.
- [Kara] You're a Ca-

15:42.322 --> 15:44.110
(Marc and Kara laughing)

15:44.110 --> 15:44.943
Are we right?

15:44.943 --> 15:46.170
- I hate you both.

15:46.170 --> 15:47.003
- Oh my gosh.

15:52.920 --> 15:54.853
So tell us more Sean?

15:58.640 --> 16:01.750
- Well, I met Dawn at a weed shop in WEHO.

16:06.444 --> 16:07.633
I'd never seen her there before.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.963
I mean, not like I go often.

16:10.950 --> 16:13.533
(gentle music)

16:15.170 --> 16:19.710
She was a hippie gypsy
type, ethereal, petite,

16:19.710 --> 16:21.423
fragile with a touch of punk.

16:22.800 --> 16:23.633
She was wearing one

16:23.633 --> 16:25.400
of those long flowing
Haight-Ashbury skirts

16:25.400 --> 16:27.550
and a black Ramones beater shirt.

16:27.550 --> 16:29.370
One of her ears was loaded with piercings

16:29.370 --> 16:32.080
and she had a rose tattoo
on the inside of her arm.

16:32.080 --> 16:35.950
Her long, dirty blonde hair had pink tips.

16:35.950 --> 16:37.290
What do they call that?

16:37.290 --> 16:41.820
- Ombre, looked completely
dump on me, but anyway.

16:41.820 --> 16:44.173
I'm sorry, please keep going.

16:46.870 --> 16:47.920
- How can I help you?

16:48.950 --> 16:50.800
- [Sean] Talk about a loaded question.

16:50.800 --> 16:53.790
I felt this amazing
warmth emanating from her.

16:53.790 --> 16:56.270
Call it crazy, stupid love at first sight.

16:56.270 --> 16:58.000
I had really bad shoulder pain

16:58.000 --> 16:59.290
from an old baseball injury.

16:59.290 --> 17:02.280
I played in college and then
tweaked it playing softball.

17:02.280 --> 17:04.369
I just went through really nasty breakup.

17:04.369 --> 17:08.410
I was vulnerable and in pain, both psychic

17:08.410 --> 17:13.323
and physical and stress,
just so much fucking stress.

17:30.357 --> 17:33.357
- [Dawn] You know, you're
carrying a lot of negative energy.

17:34.410 --> 17:37.383
It's bopped, the weed
will definitely help.

17:38.430 --> 17:40.630
- [Sean] She told me
she was a Reiki master.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.340
- I'm a Reiki master.

17:44.340 --> 17:45.443
I do energy work.

17:46.280 --> 17:48.830
I can help you to release
all that negative energy.

17:49.830 --> 17:51.320
- [Sean] I started seeing her as a patient

17:51.320 --> 17:55.210
and then she became the
yin to my yang, until...

18:10.653 --> 18:12.833
- Until what man?

18:15.710 --> 18:17.383
You know what, put a pin in it.

18:18.540 --> 18:20.140
Tell me after I go see this guy.

18:24.440 --> 18:25.633
- Can I have one of those?

18:26.633 --> 18:28.257
- Oh yeah, sure.

18:28.257 --> 18:30.650
- Hmm?
- What?

18:30.650 --> 18:31.810
- No judgment.

18:31.810 --> 18:33.322
- Don't you have someplace to go?

18:33.322 --> 18:36.693
- I didn't even see that Jenny.

18:36.693 --> 18:37.526
- Thank you.

18:37.526 --> 18:38.530
- I'll be right back.

18:38.530 --> 18:40.353
- I recommend you only take half.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.613
- Oh, I'll have the other half.

18:43.932 --> 18:48.932
I'm gonna eat that.
(upbeat music)

18:56.453 --> 18:57.840
- How are you?
- What up?

18:57.840 --> 19:00.673
- [Man] You good?
- Yeah, you know.

19:01.543 --> 19:03.640
- Do you think I should take
a photo of him just in case?

19:03.640 --> 19:06.120
- There's a photo of him on the app silly.

19:06.120 --> 19:07.930
- No, I mean of just this location.

19:07.930 --> 19:11.430
It'll be geo tagged then I
can send it to my husband.

19:11.430 --> 19:12.730
- That's right, all right.

19:16.110 --> 19:17.430
- [Jen] What's in the bag?

19:17.430 --> 19:18.716
- [Marc] BC, BC

19:18.716 --> 19:19.838
- What is it in the bag?

19:19.838 --> 19:20.671
You want me to?

19:20.671 --> 19:22.384
- What is in the bag?

19:22.384 --> 19:23.290
What is in the bag?

19:23.290 --> 19:24.570
- Oh excuse me, what are you putting

19:24.570 --> 19:26.093
at my feet?
- The bag.

19:27.520 --> 19:30.140
All these questions you're
asking are rhetorical.

19:30.140 --> 19:31.050
Who's ready?

19:31.050 --> 19:32.850
Okay guys, next stop?

19:32.850 --> 19:36.033
- [Kara] Paradise!
- Paradise indeed.

19:36.033 --> 19:41.033
(car engine roaring)
(mid tempo music)

19:55.350 --> 19:59.280
- So what happened Sean?

19:59.280 --> 20:00.700
- What happened?

20:00.700 --> 20:02.070
I was a total Dick that's what happened.

20:02.070 --> 20:03.730
I was an asshole.

20:03.730 --> 20:06.353
This actress was hitting on me

20:06.353 --> 20:08.280
and it comes with the territory.

20:08.280 --> 20:09.113
I'm an agent,

20:09.113 --> 20:12.083
but I had a meaningless
one night stand with her.

20:13.780 --> 20:14.680
Totally regret it.

20:16.360 --> 20:18.060
- That's some bad shit.

20:18.060 --> 20:22.200
- Like I said, I'm an asshole seriously.

20:22.200 --> 20:24.867
- But whatever, life has
no intrinsic value anyway.

20:26.130 --> 20:27.830
- I hate myself so much right now.

20:28.980 --> 20:32.197
One bad fucker choice.

20:36.450 --> 20:37.713
I was on Dawn's table.

20:39.690 --> 20:40.523
Then she said.

20:42.160 --> 20:43.510
- [Dawn] I feel something.

20:43.510 --> 20:45.800
- [Sean] Yeah, work's been.

20:45.800 --> 20:50.800
- Perhaps, no this is new, different.

20:54.910 --> 20:55.743
- I cheated on you.

20:55.743 --> 20:57.660
I love you Dawn more than life itself.

20:57.660 --> 20:58.860
Can you ever forgive me?

21:01.562 --> 21:03.160
Then she said.

21:03.160 --> 21:05.723
- There's too much negative
energy in Los Angeles.

21:08.380 --> 21:09.760
- She packed up her things

21:09.760 --> 21:12.060
and went to Paradise,
Nevada where she's from.

21:13.250 --> 21:15.310
We haven't spoken since.

21:15.310 --> 21:16.520
It's just only been a week,

21:16.520 --> 21:19.163
but it feels like forever.

21:20.960 --> 21:23.120
- Do you really think that
she's gonna take you back?

21:23.120 --> 21:25.770
- I highly doubt it,
but I got to try right?

21:25.770 --> 21:27.220
Take some action.

21:27.220 --> 21:31.180
- Hashtag truth, but if
it's any consolation,

21:31.180 --> 21:33.693
every humiliation in your life in the end,

21:34.560 --> 21:35.710
it's totally forgotten.

21:37.830 --> 21:38.963
- I was cheated on.

21:40.828 --> 21:42.360
It was freshman year of college

21:42.360 --> 21:46.520
and I was going through a lesbian phase.

21:46.520 --> 21:48.720
I was bi-curious you know?

21:48.720 --> 21:51.640
And I was kind of naive in college.

21:51.640 --> 21:54.500
I don't know, I met this
girl and she was so cool

21:55.940 --> 21:57.630
and she fucking cheated on me.

21:57.630 --> 22:00.960
And then I was devastated
and I had a nervous breakdown

22:00.960 --> 22:02.690
and my parents had an intervention.

22:02.690 --> 22:05.300
They were like, "You got
to get back to boys."

22:05.300 --> 22:08.733
And really, they're not
even better so I don't know.

22:11.840 --> 22:13.723
- Heartache just fucking hurts.

22:15.060 --> 22:17.240
- Well, that could just be some heartburn.

22:17.240 --> 22:19.790
I mean, I have stuff in my bag for that

22:19.790 --> 22:21.883
'cause you've been
drinking, I'm just saying.

22:23.170 --> 22:25.210
- [Kara] Did you know that you
have neurons in your heart?

22:25.210 --> 22:26.300
- Do you mean like brain cells?

22:26.300 --> 22:29.433
- Here, take two.
- Take two.

22:31.970 --> 22:33.830
Yeah man, feelings are great and all,

22:33.830 --> 22:38.830
but don't keep them
trapped inside, release.

22:39.310 --> 22:40.880
- Easier said than done.

22:40.880 --> 22:42.573
- My dad cheated on my mom too.

22:44.291 --> 22:45.124
- I'm sorry.

22:46.440 --> 22:49.602
- [Jen] My parents, I mean,
they didn't have time to cheat.

22:49.602 --> 22:51.937
They didn't have time
for recreational sex.

22:51.937 --> 22:54.770
(mid tempo music)

23:07.270 --> 23:08.970
- Say guys, can we stop for coffee?

23:08.970 --> 23:12.093
I'm just really tired
and I'm out of Adderall.

23:19.200 --> 23:22.135
- Okay fine.
- Yeah, all right!

23:22.135 --> 23:23.470
(car doors slam shut)

23:23.470 --> 23:26.471
- They have this convenient
store (indistinct),

23:26.471 --> 23:28.010
me and my sister.

23:28.010 --> 23:29.838
Well, my grandparents basically raised us.

23:29.838 --> 23:30.671
They didn't have time

23:30.671 --> 23:33.330
for anything except for our basic needs.

23:33.330 --> 23:34.163
And then my mom,

23:34.163 --> 23:37.550
she doesn't understand why I
gave up my career for my kids.

23:37.550 --> 23:38.383
She shouldn't complain,

23:38.383 --> 23:40.190
I gave her grandkids.
- Yeah.

23:40.190 --> 23:41.240
- Large black coffee.

23:43.418 --> 23:46.610
- I'm just wondering, what
are your milk alternatives

23:46.610 --> 23:47.920
on there for the extra dollar?

23:47.920 --> 23:52.450
- Yeah, almond, cashew,
Brazil, peanut, cashew, hemp.

23:52.450 --> 23:54.250
I said cashew, apologies.

23:54.250 --> 23:58.510
Rice, hemp, 2%, petunia and the florals,

23:58.510 --> 24:02.930
orange, carrot, pea,
regular milk if you want.

24:02.930 --> 24:04.720
- Regular, I will do regular milk.

24:04.720 --> 24:07.130
And what kind of sugar
options do you guys have?

24:07.130 --> 24:08.120
Do you have like?

24:08.120 --> 24:10.093
- Splenda, equal, stevia, agave,

24:11.090 --> 24:16.090
sucralose, droplets, liquid
nitrogen, more droplets.

24:16.830 --> 24:21.070
Sugar, raw, brown, organic, non organic

24:21.070 --> 24:22.713
if you really wanna go there.

24:26.260 --> 24:27.880
- Okay yeah, we're good.

24:27.880 --> 24:32.460
- Well, mom was an activist
and dad was a radical.

24:32.460 --> 24:33.293
Mama is the first in her family

24:33.293 --> 24:35.790
to go to college, Berkeley too.

24:35.790 --> 24:38.640
Back when Berkeley was
like Berkeley, right?

24:38.640 --> 24:42.169
Yeah, mom was like a true bra burning,

24:42.169 --> 24:44.183
feminist Latina, hell raiser.

24:45.740 --> 24:48.520
Dad was like angry Black Panther,

24:48.520 --> 24:50.370
emphasis on angry.

24:50.370 --> 24:51.203
Did some time.

24:53.080 --> 24:54.233
- My dad cheated too.

24:55.700 --> 24:58.693
He is a dick.

25:00.590 --> 25:01.423
I'm a dick.

25:02.610 --> 25:04.290
Father like son.

25:04.290 --> 25:07.730
- Own your choices, freewill.

25:07.730 --> 25:09.140
- Wow.
- Right.

25:09.140 --> 25:11.000
- That's comforting to
know that my life sucks

25:11.000 --> 25:14.093
because I willed it.
- Namaste.

25:15.120 --> 25:16.720
- Are choices even a good thing?

25:18.040 --> 25:19.470
- Are you guys fucking out of your mind?

25:19.470 --> 25:21.920
Did you say are choices a good thing?

25:21.920 --> 25:23.160
Jenny holy crap,

25:23.160 --> 25:26.780
we live in a time and in
a culture where it's okay

25:26.780 --> 25:28.270
for women to make their choices.

25:28.270 --> 25:29.600
That is so important.

25:29.600 --> 25:30.950
We are so lucky.

25:30.950 --> 25:33.230
This is unbelievable that we have this.

25:33.230 --> 25:35.700
People have sacrificed so
much for that to be possible.

25:35.700 --> 25:37.330
I mean, I marched in DC.

25:37.330 --> 25:40.390
I am a fourth wave card carrying feminist.

25:40.390 --> 25:41.272
- Ow!
- Wow, wow, wow, okay.

25:41.272 --> 25:42.647
- Oh my God, are you okay?

25:42.647 --> 25:43.673
Oh my God, I'm sorry.

25:43.673 --> 25:45.670
- Those are strong little squirrel hands.

25:45.670 --> 25:46.800
They're very deceiving.
- Oh my God,

25:46.800 --> 25:48.460
even though people think we hit men,

25:48.460 --> 25:49.480
- We don't do that.
- I'm sorry,

25:49.480 --> 25:50.313
I was just emphatic about this

25:50.313 --> 25:52.120
and I just use the arms, I use them.

25:53.419 --> 25:54.252
- Oh my God.

25:55.372 --> 25:56.672
- I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

26:00.493 --> 26:01.575
- Stoned and sorry at the same time.

26:01.575 --> 26:02.649
- I was trying to say I'm sorry

26:02.649 --> 26:03.676
and I'm stoned

26:03.676 --> 26:06.676
at the same time.
- Storied, stonied.

26:08.207 --> 26:10.122
- [Sean] I can't get her out of my head.

26:10.122 --> 26:12.955
(mid tempo music)

26:36.960 --> 26:40.580
- I marched too in Los Angeles area

26:41.520 --> 26:43.573
with my stepdaughter and my daughters.

26:45.280 --> 26:46.390
It felt really good.

26:46.390 --> 26:49.468
It felt important, like
we were part of something.

26:49.468 --> 26:52.580
- Did you write a
groundbreaking blog about it?

26:52.580 --> 26:55.290
- Ha ha, screw you both.

26:55.290 --> 26:58.140
I just felt like it was supposed
to be easier, different.

26:59.250 --> 27:00.530
- [Kara] I hear you.

27:00.530 --> 27:03.770
- Because you got participation
trophies just for showing up

27:03.770 --> 27:06.550
and told unconditionally
that you were special.

27:06.550 --> 27:09.523
News flash, we can't
all be special can we?

27:10.700 --> 27:12.824
- I can't get her out of my head.

27:12.824 --> 27:15.660
- Well, that my friend
is positive nihilism.

27:15.660 --> 27:18.310
All that matters is what
we deem as important,

27:18.310 --> 27:19.273
that is freedom.

27:21.690 --> 27:25.930
- Whatever, I am essentially
homeless you guys.

27:25.930 --> 27:29.480
I mean, I just wrapped up a dog
sitting gig in Beverly Hills

27:29.480 --> 27:31.030
and I don't know,

27:31.030 --> 27:35.323
I have like $300 left
to my name and it sucks.

27:38.890 --> 27:40.930
My mom was helping me out for a while,

27:40.930 --> 27:42.683
but I mean, she cut me off.

27:44.900 --> 27:49.680
I don't know, I need like a
steady gig of side hustle thing

27:49.680 --> 27:52.050
so that I can keep going to auditions.

27:52.050 --> 27:53.750
- Have you ever thought it might be time

27:53.750 --> 27:56.823
to maybe I don't know, give up the dream?

27:57.700 --> 27:58.710
- I'm not giving up my dream.

27:58.710 --> 28:00.210
You sound like my mom, Jesus Christ.

28:00.210 --> 28:02.483
- I'm sorry, geez.

28:03.680 --> 28:04.780
It's not what I meant.

28:06.690 --> 28:08.100
I don't know if writing about motherhood

28:08.100 --> 28:09.513
is my passion anyway.

28:10.660 --> 28:12.270
- Passion is a lie.

28:12.270 --> 28:13.730
- [Jen] What are you a fortune cookie?

28:13.730 --> 28:15.750
- Mean fortune cookie.

28:15.750 --> 28:18.050
- Capitalism tells us to take our passion

28:18.050 --> 28:20.227
to turn it into work, right?

28:20.227 --> 28:22.190
So that work will set you free.

28:22.190 --> 28:26.540
Passion is the big lie that
keeps the whole system in place.

28:26.540 --> 28:30.350
- Well Marc, if I'm working
then I'm not raising my kids

28:30.350 --> 28:33.830
and if I'm not working, then
I'm not a positive role model.

28:33.830 --> 28:36.930
I used to actually be a
feminist just like both of you,

28:36.930 --> 28:41.930
but now I'm just like this
bottom line zombie mom.

28:44.940 --> 28:49.023
Could you be a feminist and
stay home mom at the same time?

28:49.910 --> 28:51.260
- Yes you can.

28:51.260 --> 28:53.320
The definition of feminism
is just that you believe

28:53.320 --> 28:54.780
in equal rights for men and women.

28:54.780 --> 28:56.010
So yeah, you can do that.

28:56.010 --> 28:56.843
- Yeah, I know.

28:56.843 --> 28:58.733
It was just a rhetorical question.

28:59.720 --> 29:01.820
- Okay, I'm sorry that you
feel judged in your life

29:01.820 --> 29:03.600
and you don't know, you have a predicament

29:03.600 --> 29:04.470
about what you're gonna do,

29:04.470 --> 29:09.070
but really imagine being a
single woman with no boyfriend,

29:09.070 --> 29:12.360
no career, no kids in your '30s.

29:12.360 --> 29:15.280
I mean Jesus, you wanna be judged,

29:15.280 --> 29:18.763
walk into our holiday party
with your mom's friends.

29:19.698 --> 29:21.050
- [Marc] No one's judging you.

29:21.050 --> 29:22.700
- Oh, everybody is judging.

29:22.700 --> 29:24.023
You most of all Marc.

29:25.090 --> 29:28.273
- Yeah, and actually women
are the worst to each other.

29:30.750 --> 29:32.203
- What is your passion huh?

29:33.080 --> 29:34.463
Quoting philosophy 101?

29:35.580 --> 29:37.380
- I'm an artist.
- Oh?

29:37.380 --> 29:41.050
- Yeah, look, check it out, tattoos.

29:41.050 --> 29:44.040
See, tribal, something small.

29:44.040 --> 29:48.500
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to sound rude just now.

29:48.500 --> 29:50.510
They actually are really beautiful.

29:50.510 --> 29:53.500
- Thank you, I'm also a Shaman.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.027
- You mean a Shaman?
- Right.

29:56.247 --> 29:59.620
And I sell shit.
- What kind of shit?

29:59.620 --> 30:02.729
- Mostly drugs.
- Did I not say

30:02.729 --> 30:05.700
when we went to that house
that he's a drug dealer?

30:05.700 --> 30:06.550
- You did say it,

30:06.550 --> 30:07.383
but we're not worried.
- No, no, no

30:07.383 --> 30:08.727
the stuff I picked up this morning,

30:09.940 --> 30:11.820
that wasn't what I usually do.

30:11.820 --> 30:14.810
I usually send people
psychedelics to the dark web.

30:14.810 --> 30:17.540
I set them free.
- The dark web?

30:17.540 --> 30:20.030
- Yes, it's also where I host my blog.

30:20.030 --> 30:22.639
- Okay, this is all very
comforting, thank you.

30:22.639 --> 30:24.020
- No, the shit that I
picked up this morning,

30:24.020 --> 30:29.020
that is farm to table
grade A organic psilocybin.

30:29.740 --> 30:32.090
That's the good shit, top shelf.

30:32.090 --> 30:34.590
- Magic mushrooms, take me away.

30:34.590 --> 30:36.390
- Exactly, that's my boy (chuckles).

30:37.809 --> 30:39.140
- I've done shrooms too.

30:39.140 --> 30:41.423
- Okay, dropping bombs.

30:43.920 --> 30:44.810
Well, this will be different

30:44.810 --> 30:47.060
because it would be guided by me.

30:47.060 --> 30:50.600
Yes, can't take a journey to Paradise

30:50.600 --> 30:54.263
without first taking
a journey to Paradise.

30:55.670 --> 30:56.503
- Okay, you can get your hand out

30:56.503 --> 30:57.885
of my face.
- I'm sorry.

30:57.885 --> 30:58.820
- That was profound.

30:58.820 --> 31:01.620
- And did we say we were
going to do shrooms with you?

31:01.620 --> 31:04.570
- You, you intimated.
- What?

31:04.570 --> 31:06.410
- The answer was in your eyes.

31:06.410 --> 31:08.360
- I mean, I know he was but...

31:08.360 --> 31:10.850
- [Marc] Well, it's done.

31:10.850 --> 31:11.900
- [Jen] Let me think about that.

31:11.900 --> 31:12.733
- [Marc] It's happening.

31:12.733 --> 31:14.250
- [Kara] Does your spatial
awareness get better

31:14.250 --> 31:15.823
or worse with mushrooms?

31:17.590 --> 31:20.513
- [Jen] How long does this last?

31:33.230 --> 31:35.530
- [Kara] I have to pee.
- [Jen] Yeah, me too.

31:42.429 --> 31:45.012
(gentle music)

31:52.600 --> 31:56.100
(car doors slamming shut)

32:11.000 --> 32:12.170
- Yeah, I know.

32:12.170 --> 32:13.760
I know, the staff meeting.

32:13.760 --> 32:16.652
The staff, but listen to me.

32:16.652 --> 32:19.628
Listen to me!

32:19.628 --> 32:23.740
I'm taking a mental health day, Dan!

32:23.740 --> 32:24.930
For what?

32:24.930 --> 32:27.100
For my mental health, fuck!

32:37.510 --> 32:40.010
- Good, totally on the toilet.

33:06.051 --> 33:06.884
- Shit.

33:10.880 --> 33:13.097
Hi Mrs. Wilson, how are you?

33:14.590 --> 33:15.423
What?

33:16.300 --> 33:20.363
Wait, she pushed Jack off
a swing during recess?

33:21.520 --> 33:23.510
Well, I'm sure that she didn't mean to.

33:23.510 --> 33:24.910
I'm sure it was an accident.

33:27.010 --> 33:29.180
Well, have you called my husband?

33:29.180 --> 33:31.370
No, I'm not really around today,

33:31.370 --> 33:33.576
but no Mrs. Wilson I understand.

33:33.576 --> 33:35.170
I understand that there's zero tolerance,

33:35.170 --> 33:37.380
but she didn't mean it.

33:37.380 --> 33:39.690
And I completely understand
that there's policy,

33:39.690 --> 33:42.933
but there's no way that she
actually meant to do this.

33:45.340 --> 33:47.230
I'm so sorry, Mrs. Wilson.

33:47.230 --> 33:49.270
Jack's mom is on the other line.

33:49.270 --> 33:53.720
If you could just, I'll call my husband.

33:53.720 --> 33:54.553
I'm so sorry.

33:54.553 --> 33:55.386
I'm so sorry.

33:55.386 --> 33:56.219
I'm so sorry to do this.

33:56.219 --> 33:58.600
Hey Claire, how's he doing?

33:58.600 --> 34:00.570
Yeah, we're having our tests next week.

34:00.570 --> 34:01.920
I'm so, so sorry.

34:01.920 --> 34:03.560
We're getting your tested next week.

34:03.560 --> 34:06.080
Excuse me, Rose did not mean to.

34:06.080 --> 34:06.913
What?

34:06.913 --> 34:09.960
My daughter is not a bully Claire.

34:09.960 --> 34:13.760
She's got, Claire?

34:13.760 --> 34:15.699
Hello?

34:15.699 --> 34:16.933
Claire?

34:19.900 --> 34:24.860
Peter, yeah, no I'm not there yet.

34:24.860 --> 34:26.420
I'm driving there.

34:26.420 --> 34:27.773
I'm not driving,

34:29.809 --> 34:32.290
my ride share driver's
driving me from here to,

34:32.290 --> 34:34.090
it's not even important right now Peter

34:34.090 --> 34:36.230
because Rose is in the principal's office.

34:36.230 --> 34:39.340
Jack, she pushed him off the swing.

34:39.340 --> 34:41.260
I know, there's zero tolerance.

34:41.260 --> 34:42.969
You know what stupid school,

34:42.969 --> 34:46.283
we pay this money and it's like no.

34:48.210 --> 34:49.070
Well, what do you want me to do?

34:49.070 --> 34:50.270
You want me to just go outside

34:50.270 --> 34:52.560
and tell this driver that he's
got to bring you back to LA?

34:52.560 --> 34:53.663
I can't do that.

34:55.860 --> 34:58.510
Well, I was hoping that you
would just cancel the rest

34:58.510 --> 35:00.650
of your day and go pick up your daughter.

35:00.650 --> 35:02.227
No, I understand.

35:02.227 --> 35:03.587
I'm not freaking out.

35:03.587 --> 35:04.880
I'm not freaking out.

35:04.880 --> 35:06.240
I just want to make sure

35:06.240 --> 35:08.040
that this is taken care of properly.

35:09.631 --> 35:12.163
Oh God, don't cry, don't cry,

35:12.163 --> 35:15.050
don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.

35:15.050 --> 35:18.533
I really appreciate it, okay bye.

35:34.266 --> 35:35.183
- Oh, fuck!

35:48.873 --> 35:50.953
(door creaks open)
(door creaks shut)

35:50.953 --> 35:52.983
- Oh, you waited?
- Yeah.

35:54.310 --> 35:57.733
You feeling okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

36:00.690 --> 36:02.600
- So I didn't tell you this before,

36:02.600 --> 36:06.293
but I actually used to be married.

36:07.602 --> 36:08.743
- You were?

36:09.610 --> 36:11.970
- Yeah, don't sound so surprised.

36:11.970 --> 36:14.420
- Sorry, I didn't mean
for it to sound like that.

36:16.290 --> 36:18.593
So what happened?

36:21.450 --> 36:24.580
- I dunno, I Just kind of
like divorced the nicest guy

36:24.580 --> 36:25.530
in the whole world.

36:27.200 --> 36:28.033
- Why?

36:30.730 --> 36:33.890
- Don't you have a mom
conference to get to

36:33.890 --> 36:37.190
where you can talk to well adjusted women

36:37.190 --> 36:40.053
who are blissfully married?

36:43.930 --> 36:45.220
No, it's okay.

36:45.220 --> 36:46.580
If you wanna hear about it,

36:46.580 --> 36:48.280
I'll tell you about it in the car.

36:49.230 --> 36:50.063
- I do.

36:53.200 --> 36:56.760
- Hey Marc, you're looking for UFO's?

36:56.760 --> 36:58.149
- What are you doing?

36:58.149 --> 37:02.900
- Ladies, tonight is special.

37:04.920 --> 37:06.720
It's lunar eclipse.

37:06.720 --> 37:08.073
It's the wolf blood moon.

37:09.070 --> 37:11.560
It's the beginning of the Aquarius season

37:11.560 --> 37:13.550
- Blood moon what?

37:13.550 --> 37:16.290
- Look, tonight is special.

37:16.290 --> 37:18.860
Tonight, the moon is closer to
the earth than it usually is.

37:18.860 --> 37:20.520
And according to folklore,

37:20.520 --> 37:23.070
that's when you can hear
the wolves howl (howling).

37:30.100 --> 37:34.600
- Wait, wolves?
- Yes, canis lupus.

37:34.600 --> 37:38.130
- Okay, so in a lunar eclipse,
the moon is always red

37:38.130 --> 37:41.110
and it's like this giant
doorway is just opened.

37:41.110 --> 37:43.000
It's a time of completion,

37:43.000 --> 37:46.900
of endings and beginnings, new beginnings.

37:46.900 --> 37:48.050
It's the time in your life

37:48.050 --> 37:50.260
when you're just really
faced with your emotions

37:50.260 --> 37:52.590
and confronted with intimate relationships

37:52.590 --> 37:54.730
in home and family life.

37:54.730 --> 37:56.810
- Yes, luna to decanis lupus.

37:56.810 --> 38:01.323
Tonight, the biggest
challenge will be ourselves.

38:03.370 --> 38:05.690
But okay, we should get going.

38:05.690 --> 38:07.740
Somebody's gotta get to a cocktail party.

38:10.211 --> 38:14.213
(gentle music)
Away, away.

38:16.120 --> 38:18.173
- Guys, wait a second.

38:21.310 --> 38:25.803
I don't know if it's like
the wolf moon blood thing.

38:29.870 --> 38:32.040
Fuck Vegas, fuck the conference.

38:32.040 --> 38:32.923
- Jen, language.

38:33.960 --> 38:36.500
- I mean, this is my big find myself,

38:36.500 --> 38:38.450
get away from my kids weekend.

38:38.450 --> 38:39.840
Why should I be around a bunch

38:39.840 --> 38:41.170
of self-righteous mom bloggers

38:41.170 --> 38:44.150
who just blog about literally shit?

38:44.150 --> 38:45.418
Not that there's anything wrong

38:45.418 --> 38:46.743
with blogging about shit Marc.

38:48.920 --> 38:50.423
Let's get Sean to Paradise.

38:52.960 --> 38:53.793
- Thanks guys.

38:55.250 --> 38:56.980
- [Kara] Can we get some food though?

38:56.980 --> 39:00.413
- Absolutely no.
- I'm hungry, I could eat.

39:11.770 --> 39:15.023
- [Kara] After graduating
college, I moved back home.

39:17.030 --> 39:17.863
- Excuse me?

39:19.250 --> 39:21.350
- At the gas station
before you were asking me

39:21.350 --> 39:23.068
about why my marriage ended?

39:23.068 --> 39:24.000
- You were married.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.173
- Yeah, for like a year.

39:27.750 --> 39:29.820
And I moved back home
after graduating college.

39:29.820 --> 39:34.820
I got a job in healthcare
and there was a guy there.

39:35.130 --> 39:35.963
His name was Tim.

39:35.963 --> 39:37.710
He was a biomedical engineer.

39:37.710 --> 39:41.850
He was 29, I was 23 and he liked me.

39:41.850 --> 39:43.380
And what more cloud you want?

39:43.380 --> 39:45.660
So we started dating.

39:45.660 --> 39:47.620
He was sweet, and cute, and smart

39:47.620 --> 39:49.813
and he didn't mind that I was smart too.

39:50.862 --> 39:53.010
He loved that I was goofy and weird,

39:53.010 --> 39:54.363
laughed at my jokes.

39:56.120 --> 39:58.103
So when he proposed,

39:59.430 --> 40:02.100
I had no reason to say anything but yes.

40:02.100 --> 40:04.260
He did it like a perfect prince

40:04.260 --> 40:06.310
that my parents were so proud of me for.

40:06.310 --> 40:07.143
I swear to God,

40:07.143 --> 40:09.310
my dad was more proud of
me the day I got married

40:09.310 --> 40:12.070
than when I graduated college.

40:12.070 --> 40:13.420
And I went through all the motions.

40:13.420 --> 40:16.980
We had a house, a dog and
this beautiful wedding.

40:16.980 --> 40:18.453
- Sounds really nice.

40:20.100 --> 40:24.430
- It was, but I was playing
a part and I knew it.

40:25.710 --> 40:26.990
It didn't feel right.

40:26.990 --> 40:28.763
So I started to manifest.

40:30.710 --> 40:31.850
- [Jen] What, like "The secret"?

40:31.850 --> 40:35.330
- Yeah, I started to
keep a gratitude journal

40:35.330 --> 40:39.020
about why I was so lucky to be Tim's wife,

40:39.020 --> 40:41.690
have him and my family, and my job

40:41.690 --> 40:43.570
and everything that I did have.

40:43.570 --> 40:47.870
And I became obsessed with
really becoming this person,

40:47.870 --> 40:49.600
Tim's perfect wife.

40:49.600 --> 40:54.343
I made a vision board about how
to be the best wife for Tim.

40:56.120 --> 40:57.150
That vision board became

40:57.150 --> 41:00.133
about me being the best actress for me.

41:02.050 --> 41:05.120
In high school, I was in drama club.

41:05.120 --> 41:10.120
I was a thespian and I felt
the absolute most alive

41:10.210 --> 41:11.740
when I was on stage.

41:11.740 --> 41:13.673
I always wanted to be an actress.

41:14.530 --> 41:15.727
I told Tim that I was gonna leave him

41:15.727 --> 41:17.490
and I was gonna move to LA.

41:17.490 --> 41:18.710
Everyone thought I was nuts,

41:18.710 --> 41:21.513
my best friend, Tim, my family.

41:22.510 --> 41:24.757
I don't know, he tried
to offer me a settlement

41:24.757 --> 41:26.590
in the divorce.

41:26.590 --> 41:30.913
He was such a nice guy, but
I couldn't take his money.

41:32.850 --> 41:34.380
I wouldn't be broke now if I had,

41:34.380 --> 41:36.973
but I needed a clean break.

41:38.090 --> 41:41.800
Tim's married again to a very nice woman

41:43.100 --> 41:45.723
that 110% looks like me.

41:48.230 --> 41:50.760
- [Jen] Well, do you have any regrets?

41:50.760 --> 41:51.593
- Not at all.

41:52.810 --> 41:55.510
I think I would've put my
head in the oven eventually.

41:57.920 --> 41:58.920
It's all right Sean.

42:02.260 --> 42:03.710
What about you?

42:03.710 --> 42:04.810
- Well, what about me?

42:05.790 --> 42:07.460
- Do you have any regrets?

42:07.460 --> 42:09.513
- What, about my marriage?

42:12.940 --> 42:17.940
No, no, no I don't.

42:21.550 --> 42:22.383
I do not.

42:37.140 --> 42:40.700
- When all the ingredients
work together in harmony,

42:40.700 --> 42:42.913
it makes for a delicious meal.

42:42.913 --> 42:43.760
A singular experience.

42:43.760 --> 42:45.289
- A grilled cheese?

42:45.289 --> 42:46.410
What happened for you in grilled cheese?

42:46.410 --> 42:48.230
- There's a symphony going on.

42:48.230 --> 42:49.410
Sean?
- Huh?

42:49.410 --> 42:51.210
- Do you wanna share with the class?

42:52.180 --> 42:54.710
- Sorry guys, I'm writing a letter to Dawn

42:54.710 --> 42:56.680
and it's just piece of shit.

42:56.680 --> 42:59.920
- Oh.
- Oh, I'm sure it's not.

42:59.920 --> 43:02.100
- Well, why don't you bounce
it off us, we'll help you.

43:02.100 --> 43:03.193
- Workshop.
- Yeah.

43:09.130 --> 43:09.963
- Hey babe.

43:09.963 --> 43:11.750
- Okay.
- What?

43:11.750 --> 43:14.240
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, don't.

43:14.240 --> 43:15.790
- Do better.
- Don't say babe.

43:17.010 --> 43:18.960
- My dearest Dawn.

43:18.960 --> 43:20.380
My dearest Dawn.
- That's good.

43:20.380 --> 43:21.630
- Very civil war.
- Yes.

43:22.520 --> 43:23.670
- You probably hate me.

43:24.690 --> 43:26.620
And you should hate me

43:28.311 --> 43:29.411
because I hate me too.

43:30.684 --> 43:33.384
I'm sure that's just one
more thing we have in common.

43:34.600 --> 43:36.260
I tried to blow my brains out.

43:36.260 --> 43:37.910
What?
- He did.

43:37.910 --> 43:39.560
- Yeah, I know, but it's a lot.

43:39.560 --> 43:41.630
- We don't need to do this here.

43:41.630 --> 43:43.060
- I'm sorry, we're gonna shut up.

43:43.060 --> 43:44.350
Everyone shut up.

43:44.350 --> 43:45.250
- My dearest Dawn.

43:46.940 --> 43:48.541
You probably hate me

43:48.541 --> 43:52.573
and you should hate me
because I hate me too.

43:53.580 --> 43:55.730
So that's one more
thing we have in common.

43:56.800 --> 43:59.097
I cut out the part about the.

44:01.690 --> 44:06.073
I know I'm not worthy of your
love and I need to grow up.

44:07.740 --> 44:10.990
I sabotaged the only thing
in my life that matters.

44:10.990 --> 44:15.180
And I guess I never deserve
the happiness you gave me

44:15.180 --> 44:16.193
so I destroyed it.

44:17.560 --> 44:19.860
I'll do anything to be with you.

44:19.860 --> 44:24.193
Always yours, Sean.
(Jen claps)

44:27.140 --> 44:29.390
- Okay, 'cause I can rewrite it if it's.

44:29.390 --> 44:30.630
- No, that was good.
- It's good.

44:30.630 --> 44:32.100
That was really good and I mean really,

44:32.100 --> 44:33.500
what would you have to lose?

44:37.400 --> 44:39.170
- Okay, new rule.

44:39.170 --> 44:42.350
If we're making this trip to
Paradise, no more distractions.

44:42.350 --> 44:43.960
I'm taking phones.

44:43.960 --> 44:45.204
- Dude?

44:45.204 --> 44:48.660
- No, no, no, no, I can't do
that because I have a kid.

44:48.660 --> 44:49.493
- You got a husband, right?

44:49.493 --> 44:53.340
- Yes, and he should be able
to take care of the kids

44:53.340 --> 44:55.370
for one night.
- Yes, yes.

44:55.370 --> 44:56.533
- Here, take it.

44:57.630 --> 44:59.353
I don't know who I am.

44:59.353 --> 45:00.770
You can have it.

45:01.814 --> 45:05.730
- I don't personally feel
comfortable being disconnected.

45:05.730 --> 45:07.400
You know what I mean?

45:07.400 --> 45:08.990
I have an Instagram following.

45:08.990 --> 45:10.790
- You're distracting and deflecting.

45:12.650 --> 45:13.870
Fine, make one more pose.

45:13.870 --> 45:15.853
- Okay.
- All right.

45:17.940 --> 45:18.920
- Okay.

45:18.920 --> 45:22.610
- Honey, you haven't even
eaten any of your food yet.

45:22.610 --> 45:24.110
Have a fry, here.

45:24.110 --> 45:26.620
- And now the phone.

45:26.620 --> 45:28.670
- Okay, when I started to panic
and be like, "Where is it?"

45:28.670 --> 45:31.030
Just remind me you have it.

45:31.030 --> 45:33.903
- Honey, it's okay, here, airplane.

45:35.550 --> 45:37.327
- I will eat the fry myself.

45:37.327 --> 45:38.417
- [Marc] "Sometimes the only way

45:38.417 --> 45:41.597
"from here to there isn't
the road less traveled."

45:41.597 --> 45:45.160
- [Jen] "It will make all the
difference", Robert Frost.

45:45.160 --> 45:47.310
- [Sean] Okay, let's do it.
- [Kara] Okay.

- Oh my God.

46:23.193 --> 46:24.370
- Make the space yours.

46:24.370 --> 46:25.203
- Isn't it beautiful?

46:25.203 --> 46:26.270
- Really, really get a feel for it.

46:26.270 --> 46:27.490
Sponge it up.

46:27.490 --> 46:31.933
Feel it with all of your
senses, it's festive.

46:34.750 --> 46:36.990
It's like eggnog exploded.

46:36.990 --> 46:38.520
- [Kara] It feels like a hug.

46:38.520 --> 46:40.170
- [Marc] Yeah, it doesn't it.

46:40.170 --> 46:42.410
- I see aprons.
- Go, go.

46:42.410 --> 46:45.180
Hey, I want you to find
something that speaks to you.

46:45.180 --> 46:48.250
Have a conversation
with it, a positive one,

46:48.250 --> 46:49.600
like a little mystical elf.

46:58.900 --> 47:00.450
You're still here?
- I'm here,

47:02.480 --> 47:03.593
can I have my phone?

47:15.040 --> 47:17.043
- That's funny, that's really funny.

47:18.315 --> 47:19.815
Oh my God, are you kidding me?

47:46.640 --> 47:47.923
- Not gonna happen.

47:48.890 --> 47:50.840
- Why?
- Why?

47:50.840 --> 47:52.143
Because we're here.

47:52.143 --> 47:52.976
I want you to be present

47:52.976 --> 47:55.050
- Okay, but I wanna remember this.

47:55.050 --> 47:57.020
This is fun and I don't get
to go on vacations a lot.

47:57.020 --> 47:59.963
- Remember it with this right there.

48:01.240 --> 48:03.463
That's right, let that be your DVR.

48:05.470 --> 48:09.373
- Okay, but can I have my phone though?

48:10.640 --> 48:12.570
- Again, I'm gonna be
a little oppositional

48:12.570 --> 48:14.260
and say no, okay?

48:14.260 --> 48:15.460
This is not gonna stop is it?

48:15.460 --> 48:17.370
- No, also you didn't move.

48:19.580 --> 48:21.420
- Take them.
- Thank you!

48:21.420 --> 48:22.720
- Come back soon.

48:33.230 --> 48:37.713
- You're not a bad person
through your indiscretion.

48:39.300 --> 48:41.510
People don't cheat for no reason.

48:41.510 --> 48:44.660
- Well, mine was 'cause
I was drunk and stupid.

48:44.660 --> 48:46.660
- That's an excuse, that's not a reason.

48:47.970 --> 48:49.610
Sometimes you're just not happy.

48:49.610 --> 48:51.480
- Yeah, but I was happy

48:52.660 --> 48:56.333
or maybe I just didn't think
I was entitled to be happy.

49:03.440 --> 49:04.273
Where's Kara?

49:06.120 --> 49:06.953
- I don't know.

49:13.990 --> 49:14.823
- Oh, good.

49:20.690 --> 49:22.040
- [Kara's Mom] Kara darling,

49:22.040 --> 49:26.540
I'll cover your credit card
debt again only if you come home

49:26.540 --> 49:27.770
and get help.

49:27.770 --> 49:31.413
Therapy, I'll happily
pay for it, love you.

49:35.377 --> 49:37.960
(gentle music)

49:42.710 --> 49:43.543
- Hey.

49:45.020 --> 49:48.193
- You can come get a wet
butt with me if you want.

49:49.200 --> 49:50.033
- Okay.

50:01.590 --> 50:05.190
- I feel like every
decision I've ever made

50:07.524 --> 50:11.987
is the wrong one and I'm just
absolutely destined to be old,

50:16.450 --> 50:19.293
pathetic and alone.

50:24.000 --> 50:25.450
- Wanna hear something crazy?

50:28.030 --> 50:29.663
I made all the right choices.

50:31.290 --> 50:33.680
College, my career

50:35.750 --> 50:37.713
and still my life fucking sucks.

50:39.390 --> 50:42.340
I got this glamorous, stressful job,

50:42.340 --> 50:47.340
but between taxes, my
student loan, my car loan,

50:50.521 --> 50:53.950
I'm pretty much a member of
the overeducated working poor.

50:56.100 --> 50:57.500
- That's not so sheik in LA.

51:04.430 --> 51:05.263
- I don't know

51:05.263 --> 51:08.380
if or when I won't be
living paycheck to paycheck

51:08.380 --> 51:10.383
in my shitty apartment in the valley.

51:12.890 --> 51:16.547
So I too will be old,

51:19.910 --> 51:21.823
pathetic and alone.

51:34.860 --> 51:36.520
- [Marc] Second stop!

51:36.520 --> 51:37.800
- Obviously need that.

51:39.066 --> 51:42.250
- For what?
- For breakfast?

51:42.250 --> 51:43.083
You like breakfast?

51:43.083 --> 51:43.916
I like breakfast.

51:43.916 --> 51:45.663
- I don't eat breakfast.

51:45.663 --> 51:46.650
- [Jen] When you have a child,

51:46.650 --> 51:48.303
you can no longer be one.

51:49.160 --> 51:50.030
- That sucks.

51:50.030 --> 51:52.223
- I know, it's what my mom taught me.

51:53.570 --> 51:55.380
But you know what I've learned Marc

51:55.380 --> 51:58.433
is that sometimes you just gotta say,

51:59.970 --> 52:01.570
what the fuck?
- What the fuck?

52:01.570 --> 52:04.257
- Yes, hot rep, dirty '80s.

52:04.257 --> 52:05.383
You see that?

52:06.566 --> 52:07.800
That would make a much better blog post

52:07.800 --> 52:10.250
than your kid eating
broccoli for the first time.

52:11.595 --> 52:13.000
- It's not the first
time I've done shrooms.

52:13.000 --> 52:14.520
I've done them in college.

52:14.520 --> 52:17.800
- Yeah, but this is not
gonna be like recreationally,

52:17.800 --> 52:21.230
like during your wild
sorority rebellious days.

52:21.230 --> 52:24.070
It's gonna reboot that
pretty little brain of yours.

52:24.070 --> 52:26.380
This is gonna be spiritual.

52:26.380 --> 52:28.263
It's gonna be medicinal.

52:29.710 --> 52:30.840
And I promise,

52:30.840 --> 52:34.640
Scout's honor to guide
you safely, very safely.

52:34.640 --> 52:37.247
- Yeah I know, from here to
there, I get it, I get it.

52:37.247 --> 52:39.660
- To Paradise, to Paradiso.

52:39.660 --> 52:40.493
- Look, air freshener

52:40.493 --> 52:42.663
for your car.
- You're deflecting.

52:43.640 --> 52:47.003
Third stop.
(upbeat music)

52:57.170 --> 53:02.170
Welcome my friends to the show
that never ends, ends, ends!

53:03.590 --> 53:05.610
- Okay, okay.
- I don't wanna-

53:05.610 --> 53:07.440
- Chill out and give me the shrooms

53:07.440 --> 53:10.243
'cause I need Paradise bad.

53:14.070 --> 53:17.497
- It can be meaningful but
only if you free your mind!

53:19.060 --> 53:22.123
Ceremony is mandatory!

53:24.913 --> 53:28.173
(Marc and Sean clapping)
- Clapping, you're clapping.

53:30.150 --> 53:31.830
- Okay, I'll clap.

53:31.830 --> 53:32.663
- Knees.

53:32.663 --> 53:33.496
- What?
- What?

53:33.496 --> 53:35.093
- We were just clapping?
- We were just clapping?

53:35.093 --> 53:36.178
- Get on your knees.

53:36.178 --> 53:37.011
- I'm not getting on my knees.

53:37.011 --> 53:37.844
- [Marc] Stay with me here.

53:37.844 --> 53:38.870
- Come on, let's play along.

53:38.870 --> 53:39.734
- I don't like being on my knees.

53:39.734 --> 53:40.567
- We can't get on our knees.

53:40.567 --> 53:41.400
- Get on your knees.

53:41.400 --> 53:42.500
Get up and make it happen.

53:42.500 --> 53:46.718
- Oh God, this is how
yoga class is gonna go.

53:46.718 --> 53:51.500
- This is the fungus
of the genus psilocybe.

53:51.500 --> 53:55.550
We have to surrender
to the forces of chaos,

53:55.550 --> 53:58.460
to the wilderness of the subconscious.

53:58.460 --> 53:59.960
We're tapping in

53:59.960 --> 54:03.120
to what young would call
the collective unconscious

54:03.120 --> 54:05.580
which lives within us all.

54:05.580 --> 54:08.223
So come with me won't you?

54:10.470 --> 54:12.020
Tell me with your eyes.

54:12.020 --> 54:14.600
Tell me only with your eyes.

54:14.600 --> 54:16.580
- Let's do it.
- Okay, I'm in.

54:16.580 --> 54:17.413
- Sure.
- My guy.

54:17.413 --> 54:19.897
- [Jen] You sat on those.
- A little!

54:22.182 --> 54:23.015
Not like that.

54:23.015 --> 54:24.510
- [Kara] I think they were by your feet.

54:24.510 --> 54:25.910
- Not like that grasshopper.

54:28.010 --> 54:30.433
Open the mandible.

54:34.380 --> 54:36.190
- It's like taking communion.

54:36.190 --> 54:38.863
- Exactly, well done.

54:41.660 --> 54:42.700
- How does it taste?

54:42.700 --> 54:43.770
- Like shit on a stick.

54:43.770 --> 54:45.750
- Oh great, great, great.

54:49.887 --> 54:50.720
- Do you have to put it in my mouth?

54:50.720 --> 54:51.680
I mean, are your hands clean?

54:51.680 --> 54:52.513
I mean, do we?

54:52.513 --> 54:53.543
- Spiritually, good.

55:02.900 --> 55:04.880
- The first shall be last.

55:04.880 --> 55:07.848
Open, open wide.
- Is it in?

55:07.848 --> 55:10.223
Oh God, there it is.

55:11.970 --> 55:12.803
Now what?

55:14.200 --> 55:16.053
- I'm trying to open your mind.

55:17.530 --> 55:18.590
I can lead you to the door,

55:18.590 --> 55:21.080
but only you can walk through it.

55:21.080 --> 55:23.460
- Morpheus?
- God of dreams.

55:23.460 --> 55:27.410
- No, God of matrix.

55:27.410 --> 55:30.027
Howl with me (howling).

55:43.110 --> 55:45.312
I don't hear you howling.

55:45.312 --> 55:48.820
(Marc and Sean howling)

55:48.820 --> 55:50.840
- [Marc] Bay at the moon.

55:50.840 --> 55:51.907
The wolf moon.

55:53.956 --> 55:57.039
(howling altogether)

56:07.829 --> 56:10.662
(mid tempo music)

58:08.750 --> 58:12.246
- [Jen] Marc, it's really amazing
how much stuff you can fit

58:12.246 --> 58:15.580
in the back of that orange Jeep of yours.

58:15.580 --> 58:17.770
- [Marc] That model is
surprisingly spacious.

58:17.770 --> 58:18.920
That's why I bought it.

58:21.530 --> 58:22.583
Rest your loins.

58:23.810 --> 58:25.813
- [Jen] Loins are required.

58:28.676 --> 58:31.041
- [Marc] Oh my, desert
floor is comfortable.

58:31.041 --> 58:32.773
- [Sean] Fuck yeah.

58:35.097 --> 58:40.097
(wolf howling)
(crickets chirping)

58:52.470 --> 58:53.523
- I can't sleep.

58:55.110 --> 58:57.060
Can I tell you about my marriage story?

58:58.550 --> 58:59.383
- Please

59:00.590 --> 59:04.780
- After college, I got into my Ford Escape

59:04.780 --> 59:08.000
and I just drove kinda like this

59:09.339 --> 59:14.270
and all the way to this ABC
news affiliate job in Las Vegas.

59:17.710 --> 59:22.564
It was really a weird time

59:22.564 --> 59:24.420
because that was when
the financial crisis hit

59:24.420 --> 59:27.820
and Peter was actually my news director.

59:27.820 --> 59:28.997
That's my husband.

59:28.997 --> 59:31.370
"Occupy Las Vegas" was happening

59:32.470 --> 59:37.470
and that is when I actually
was nominated for the Emmy.

59:39.410 --> 59:41.110
Man, that was a really good story.

59:43.692 --> 59:45.110
And then I found out I was pregnant

59:45.110 --> 59:46.783
and that was a whole other story.

59:51.510 --> 59:52.680
I didn't even know I was pregnant

59:52.680 --> 59:55.240
because it was so crazy with work.

59:55.240 --> 59:57.693
I wasn't keeping track of my period.

1:00:00.528 --> 1:00:02.343
I puked on one of the protestors.

1:00:04.860 --> 1:00:06.860
At first I thought it was food poisoning

1:00:07.850 --> 1:00:11.133
and Peter and I, we weren't
married at the time.

1:00:12.930 --> 1:00:17.013
Well actually, he was married
at the time, but not to me.

1:00:24.785 --> 1:00:25.810
That's my big secret.

1:00:25.810 --> 1:00:28.300
I was the other woman.

1:00:28.300 --> 1:00:32.810
We were having this hot affair,

1:00:32.810 --> 1:00:36.163
but he and his wife, they were separated.

1:00:37.540 --> 1:00:39.140
- Oh, he was separated.

1:00:39.140 --> 1:00:41.800
- Yeah, we were in love.

1:00:41.800 --> 1:00:44.773
It's just, we were just having fun

1:00:49.230 --> 1:00:50.690
and it was supposed to be carefree

1:00:50.690 --> 1:00:55.480
and it wasn't what he signed up for.

1:00:55.480 --> 1:01:00.480
So I even thought about
maybe getting an abortion,

1:01:06.330 --> 1:01:07.930
which I have never said out loud

1:01:07.930 --> 1:01:10.153
to anybody before not even Peter.

1:01:18.694 --> 1:01:22.027
What if I was just the fun rebound girl?

1:01:25.130 --> 1:01:26.030
- Do you love him?

1:01:29.781 --> 1:01:30.864
- I do, yeah.

1:01:34.180 --> 1:01:38.083
- Does he love you?
- Hmm hmm.

1:01:43.391 --> 1:01:47.474
I've never talked about
this with anybody before,

1:01:49.513 --> 1:01:52.320
not even my so-called friends.

1:01:59.580 --> 1:02:00.780
Thank you for listening.

1:02:01.850 --> 1:02:02.713
- [Kara] Thank you.

1:02:18.264 --> 1:02:19.661
- Everything all right?

1:02:19.661 --> 1:02:21.744
- Yeah, just need to pee.

1:02:22.894 --> 1:02:24.700
I don't know what to do.

1:02:24.700 --> 1:02:27.983
- Oh well, I'm not a female,

1:02:28.890 --> 1:02:31.233
but I think you just kind of gob squat.

1:02:32.660 --> 1:02:33.910
Let the body do the rest.

1:02:35.448 --> 1:02:38.818
- Oh God, okay.

1:02:38.818 --> 1:02:41.220
Can I have a little privacy?

1:02:41.220 --> 1:02:42.830
- Well, you know there's
an element out there.

1:02:42.830 --> 1:02:44.413
I just want you to be safe.

1:02:45.460 --> 1:02:46.860
There's creatures out there.

1:02:47.730 --> 1:02:50.660
I'll turn my back.
- [Jen] Thank you.

1:02:56.590 --> 1:03:00.273
- [Marc] Wow, the wolf blood moon.

1:03:01.320 --> 1:03:03.083
I love staring blankly into it.

1:03:04.510 --> 1:03:06.300
- Oh my God, it's so cold.

1:03:06.300 --> 1:03:11.300
- Yes, the dermis is finally
exposed to the atmosphere.

1:03:12.780 --> 1:03:13.930
It's a beautiful thing.

1:03:15.557 --> 1:03:17.157
- [Jen] There's no toilet paper.

1:03:20.020 --> 1:03:21.270
- You could try a cactus.

1:03:23.744 --> 1:03:24.794
A little unforgiving.

1:03:28.070 --> 1:03:28.903
How'd you do?

1:03:30.391 --> 1:03:31.618
(gentle music)

1:03:31.618 --> 1:03:34.230
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on?

1:03:34.230 --> 1:03:35.130
Are you all right?

1:03:37.550 --> 1:03:41.840
- It's just, everything in my life,

1:03:41.840 --> 1:03:44.773
it's always come so easy for me,

1:03:48.510 --> 1:03:53.013
school, sports and work,

1:03:53.850 --> 1:03:55.500
everything except for motherhood.

1:03:56.889 --> 1:03:58.540
What if I'm really bad this?

1:03:58.540 --> 1:04:01.400
- Oh my God, no, stop, stop.

1:04:01.400 --> 1:04:03.523
You are not bad at it.

1:04:03.523 --> 1:04:05.690
Just stop, let me ask you,

1:04:08.897 --> 1:04:11.853
do you love them unconditionally?

1:04:13.593 --> 1:04:17.769
And do you make them feel safe?

1:04:17.769 --> 1:04:18.602
- Yeah.

1:04:18.602 --> 1:04:21.203
- Then you are a good mom, you are.

1:04:22.679 --> 1:04:23.779
And the rest is icing.

1:04:26.360 --> 1:04:29.030
I gave my mom the craziest
wildest run for her money.

1:04:29.030 --> 1:04:33.210
I was just born a fist clenched,

1:04:33.210 --> 1:04:35.011
but that was all on me

1:04:35.011 --> 1:04:37.900
because she was a great mom.

1:04:37.900 --> 1:04:39.823
She is a great mom.

1:04:41.850 --> 1:04:43.053
She's the best mom.

1:04:45.900 --> 1:04:47.613
Let what scares you set you free.

1:04:49.730 --> 1:04:54.680
Let what scares you set
you free please huh?

1:05:03.137 --> 1:05:04.137
- Thank you.

1:05:05.813 --> 1:05:08.753
- It's nothing, it's
part of being a shaman.

1:05:09.620 --> 1:05:11.203
Or shaman.
- Shaman.

1:05:13.031 --> 1:05:15.163
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Okay.

1:05:16.460 --> 1:05:17.763
- You know those mushrooms?

1:05:19.320 --> 1:05:23.503
They weren't psilocybin,
they were shiitake on sale.

1:05:24.730 --> 1:05:26.480
Tell no one, it's our secret, okay.

1:05:30.663 --> 1:05:32.560
- Tell me you're joking right now?

1:05:32.560 --> 1:05:33.490
- That's the end of the convo.

1:05:33.490 --> 1:05:34.540
Just get in, come on.

1:05:36.690 --> 1:05:41.163
That's it, it's cold out here.

1:05:55.627 --> 1:05:58.210

1:06:01.443 --> 1:06:04.026

1:07:42.004 --> 1:07:43.813
What the, Sean?

1:07:47.378 --> 1:07:48.670
What are you doing here?

1:07:48.670 --> 1:07:50.464
Do I need to call the police?

1:07:50.464 --> 1:07:52.113
- No, no, no, no, please don't.

1:07:54.780 --> 1:07:56.193
I've been to Paradise Dawn.

1:07:57.050 --> 1:07:58.780
- Duh, whatever.

1:07:58.780 --> 1:08:00.773
- Not this Paradise.

1:08:01.930 --> 1:08:04.600
Talk about an oxymoron though right?

1:08:04.600 --> 1:08:05.690
- City of Angels, yeah,

1:08:05.690 --> 1:08:09.883
talk about an oxymoron.
- Touche, touche.

1:08:11.550 --> 1:08:14.290
Look, I'm not stalking you.

1:08:14.290 --> 1:08:16.160
Well, not in person.

1:08:16.160 --> 1:08:17.760
I did come here to win you back.

1:08:18.649 --> 1:08:21.719
I paid my ride share
from LA to bring me here.

1:08:21.719 --> 1:08:24.069
- Oh, people in the car, hey, hi.

1:08:24.986 --> 1:08:25.818
- Hi!
- Hi!

1:08:27.200 --> 1:08:28.809
- It was a pool.

1:08:28.809 --> 1:08:33.809
Anyway, I was willing to do
anything to win you back.

1:08:35.330 --> 1:08:37.450
I was gonna quit my job and stay here

1:08:37.450 --> 1:08:39.430
as long as I needed to,

1:08:39.430 --> 1:08:43.153
that was after I contemplated
killing myself yesterday.

1:08:44.010 --> 1:08:45.510
I almost did.

1:08:45.510 --> 1:08:50.042
Jesus Sean, that's a tad
dramatic wouldn't you say?

1:08:51.148 --> 1:08:53.399
I mean, we dated three months.

1:08:53.399 --> 1:08:56.240
- Four, actually.
- Four months, my bad.

1:08:56.240 --> 1:08:58.050
- You were my everything.

1:08:58.050 --> 1:09:00.803
You were the one and I knew.

1:09:02.780 --> 1:09:04.462
I thought I couldn't live without you.

1:09:05.700 --> 1:09:08.590
- Yeah well suicide, fucking suicide?

1:09:08.590 --> 1:09:10.319
It's the most selfish act.

1:09:10.319 --> 1:09:12.889
- I know, I'm the epitome of selfishness,

1:09:12.889 --> 1:09:16.823
of self-destructiveness, was.

1:09:18.219 --> 1:09:20.889
- Dawn-
- Whoa, whoa,

1:09:20.889 --> 1:09:22.030
what are you pulling out?

1:09:22.030 --> 1:09:24.910
- Actually, this is why I'm here.

1:09:24.910 --> 1:09:26.950
See, that is your contact.

1:09:26.950 --> 1:09:27.910
- Are you trying to take a selfie?

1:09:27.910 --> 1:09:29.460
- No, that's your contact.

1:09:29.460 --> 1:09:31.125
The camera was just,

1:09:31.125 --> 1:09:32.922
I was in a desert.
- That's good, that's great.

1:09:32.922 --> 1:09:34.219
- It was very pretty.

1:09:34.219 --> 1:09:37.370
Here you go, contact, gone.

1:09:37.370 --> 1:09:40.090
Pictures of us, gone.

1:09:40.090 --> 1:09:41.139
Well, that was one,

1:09:41.139 --> 1:09:44.823
but boom, boom, boom.
- [Dawn] Text messages, gone.

1:09:44.823 --> 1:09:45.656
- What was it?

1:09:45.656 --> 1:09:46.540
What'd you want?

1:09:46.540 --> 1:09:48.040
- Instagram
- Okay, Instagram.

1:09:48.040 --> 1:09:50.000
- Gotta go, you have a
real problem on that one.

1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:51.250
- Damn, you're good.

1:09:51.250 --> 1:09:53.042
- Yep, here you go.
- Here we go.

1:09:53.042 --> 1:09:54.987
- Here I am right on top.
- Unfollow.

1:09:56.370 --> 1:09:58.570
- Window open I saw?
- Block, block.

1:10:03.950 --> 1:10:05.730
- There he is.
- You have a firm handshake.

1:10:05.730 --> 1:10:07.463
- There he is.
- I'll never forget that.

1:10:10.219 --> 1:10:11.053
Bye.
- I'm very proud

1:10:11.053 --> 1:10:12.237
of you though.

1:10:12.237 --> 1:10:15.775
- [Jen] Oh my God, oh my God.

1:10:15.775 --> 1:10:16.841
- [Marc] She needs to get that fixed.

1:10:16.841 --> 1:10:17.960
- It's all right, it's been
broken for quite some time.

1:10:17.960 --> 1:10:20.822
- Well, I won't fix that,
get someone to fix it.

1:10:20.822 --> 1:10:23.469
- Yes.
- Craigslist.

1:10:23.469 --> 1:10:25.610
- [Marc] Come back, come back, come back.

1:10:25.610 --> 1:10:26.723
- Thanks guys, bye.

1:10:29.594 --> 1:10:30.698
- [Jen] It happened.

1:10:30.698 --> 1:10:31.993
- [Marc] Yeah, new beginnings.

1:10:33.960 --> 1:10:36.510
- You look happy.
- It's done.

1:10:36.510 --> 1:10:39.450
- All right man, circle is complete right?

1:10:39.450 --> 1:10:40.282
- Way to go.

1:10:40.282 --> 1:10:41.116
- You feel okay?

1:10:42.100 --> 1:10:43.903
- Actually, I feel pretty good.

1:10:46.433 --> 1:10:49.183
(birds chirping)

1:10:51.454 --> 1:10:53.270
- Good.
- Let's.

1:10:53.270 --> 1:10:55.351
- Shall we?
- Yeah, definitely.

1:10:55.351 --> 1:10:56.277
- [Jen] Yeah, lets.

1:10:56.277 --> 1:10:59.833
- [Sean] May we be old and
pathetic, but never alone.

1:11:01.510 --> 1:11:04.460
- [Kara] Did you guys know that
Paradise is just Las Vegas?

1:12:07.000 --> 1:12:08.170

1:12:08.170 --> 1:12:11.830
- So you look very refreshed.

1:12:11.830 --> 1:12:15.733
- I am, my brain is rebooted.

1:12:16.840 --> 1:12:18.450
- Is that a good thing?

1:12:18.450 --> 1:12:19.978
- Yeah, it's a good thing.

1:13:25.710 --> 1:13:28.628
(speaking in foreign language)

1:13:28.628 --> 1:13:29.770
- No problem.

1:13:29.770 --> 1:13:32.950
- (speaking in foreign language),
the rules of the house,

1:13:32.950 --> 1:13:34.825
no hats in the house.

1:13:34.825 --> 1:13:36.800
- (speaking in foreign
language), I'm sorry.

1:13:36.800 --> 1:13:37.889
- You want a snack?

1:13:37.889 --> 1:13:39.969
I'm gonna make you a snack,
(speaking in foreign language).

1:13:43.180 --> 1:13:46.693
- Hey everyone, my name is Jenny.

1:13:48.809 --> 1:13:52.940
Actually, I was born
with the name of Yuping,

1:13:52.940 --> 1:13:54.960
but when I was growing up,

1:13:54.960 --> 1:13:57.540
that was really hard for my classmates

1:13:57.540 --> 1:13:58.610
and my teachers to pronounce

1:13:58.610 --> 1:14:00.697
so I told everyone, "Just call me Jen."

1:14:01.610 --> 1:14:04.660
And then I entered the
workforce and I wanted people

1:14:04.660 --> 1:14:08.627
to take me seriously so I
said, "Call me Jennifer."

1:14:09.610 --> 1:14:10.853
And then I became a mom.

1:14:12.280 --> 1:14:14.960
I wanted to be fun and accessible

1:14:14.960 --> 1:14:17.617
so I said, "You can call me Jenny."

1:14:21.559 --> 1:14:24.160
I just cared so much about
what other people thought

1:14:26.680 --> 1:14:29.957
because I thought that if
they saw me a certain way,

1:14:29.957 --> 1:14:31.457
then that would make me happy.

1:14:34.960 --> 1:14:39.730
We live in this goal obsessed,

1:14:39.730 --> 1:14:44.730
self-help, self obsessed selfie society.

1:14:47.219 --> 1:14:50.520
And we think that if we
get to this certain place

1:14:50.520 --> 1:14:51.593
that we'll be happy,

1:14:53.559 --> 1:14:55.233
that we'll have found paradise.

1:14:58.188 --> 1:14:59.823
But paradise isn't a place.

1:15:00.892 --> 1:15:03.782
It's not a hashtag.

1:15:05.050 --> 1:15:07.170
It's not about an Instagram post

1:15:07.170 --> 1:15:10.643
or how many followers you have,
or how many likes it gets.

1:15:11.960 --> 1:15:16.313
Paradise sounds so cliche,

1:15:18.190 --> 1:15:21.343
but paradise is about the journey.

1:15:26.260 --> 1:15:28.059
A friend of mine once told me

1:15:28.059 --> 1:15:32.730
that you can either choose
to look at the anxiety

1:15:32.730 --> 1:15:37.123
in your life or you can
choose to embrace it.

1:15:40.170 --> 1:15:41.070
- That's my homie.

1:15:44.059 --> 1:15:45.410
- Another friend of mine showed me

1:15:45.410 --> 1:15:49.583
that people aren't always
what they seem, not always.

1:15:50.950 --> 1:15:53.000
And another friend showed me that life

1:15:53.860 --> 1:15:56.093
is absolutely worth fighting for.

1:16:02.670 --> 1:16:04.343
Paradise is about connection.

1:16:05.520 --> 1:16:07.293
It's about human connection.

1:16:10.222 --> 1:16:13.043
And it's about family and friends

1:16:16.730 --> 1:16:18.670
and all the people that we meet
