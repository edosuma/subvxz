WEBVTT

00:08.041 --> 00:10.244
Does someone here
take care of you?

00:10.277 --> 00:11.678
Owen, get away from him.
He could hurt you.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.747
Is he ours?

00:13.780 --> 00:15.082
Another bus full of prisoners.

00:15.115 --> 00:16.149
Where's it headed?

00:16.183 --> 00:17.150
Denver's the other way.

00:17.184 --> 00:18.151
Out there is just desert.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.086
Axel.

00:19.119 --> 00:20.654
Come on.

00:21.989 --> 00:24.424
Nothin' seems to kill you,
does it?

00:24.458 --> 00:27.594
[explosion]

00:27.628 --> 00:29.530
Get away from him!

00:29.563 --> 00:30.531
You, get in the car.

00:30.564 --> 00:31.331
No!

00:31.365 --> 00:32.199
Do what you said
and find us.

00:32.232 --> 00:35.068
You. You follow me,
they both die.

00:35.102 --> 00:37.004
He's going east, that's where
all his trucks went.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.105
I'm not stopping
till I find 'em,

00:38.138 --> 00:39.172
you know that, right?

00:39.206 --> 00:40.641
Damn straight.

01:39.533 --> 01:42.803
We should have spotted
her by now.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.304
We will.

01:44.338 --> 01:45.505
Maybe we missed the turn.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.608
Maybe we lost them.

01:47.641 --> 01:49.376
We didn't lose 'em.

01:49.409 --> 01:52.212
This is the only road
they can be on, alright?

01:52.245 --> 01:53.280
They haven't turned off,

01:53.313 --> 01:55.215
or we would have seen their
tracks if they had.

01:55.248 --> 01:57.584
We'll find them.

01:57.618 --> 02:01.221
Maybe I just have to face
the fact that they're gone.

02:01.254 --> 02:03.523
Hey, no.

02:03.557 --> 02:06.560
She had a kid during
all this shit.

02:06.593 --> 02:07.728
She raised him,
she protected him.

02:07.761 --> 02:12.399
If I had to bet on anybody
surviving this it'd be her.

02:13.233 --> 02:16.236
Why did it take you so long
to get us out of that place?

02:18.805 --> 02:21.775
I'm gonna make it right.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.543
I'm gonna find this prick
and then I'm gonna kill him.

02:23.577 --> 02:25.212
No, no, no.

02:25.245 --> 02:26.747
That's for me.

02:29.416 --> 02:31.084
If that's the way you want it.

02:31.118 --> 02:33.420
I gotta make it right, too.

02:38.425 --> 02:39.626
What is that?

02:40.494 --> 02:42.095
Stop!

03:14.494 --> 03:15.462
He's a smart kid.

03:15.495 --> 03:17.764
He left this on purpose.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.300
Max is smarter.

03:20.333 --> 03:23.537
That feels like bait to me.

03:23.570 --> 03:26.473
Why would he want us
to follow him?

03:30.644 --> 03:32.512
Look, it's the prison bus.

03:50.530 --> 03:52.666
Well, they came through here,
alright.

03:52.699 --> 03:53.967
Those are Jeep tracks.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.268
They're fresh.

03:55.302 --> 03:58.572
The bus looks empty.

03:58.605 --> 04:00.974
That's what I'm afraid of.

04:01.007 --> 04:02.175
So what do you think?

04:02.209 --> 04:03.143
He took the Jeep up the road

04:03.176 --> 04:06.313
and then doubled back around
to pick us off?

04:06.346 --> 04:08.381
There's only one way
to find out.

04:12.352 --> 04:14.654
You go left, I'll go right.

04:26.433 --> 04:30.237
I got one dead guard over here,
armed.

04:30.270 --> 04:33.874
I got one over here, too.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.679
You wanna hang here?

04:39.713 --> 04:41.414
I'll check inside.

04:55.428 --> 04:56.396
Nothing.

04:56.429 --> 04:58.298
Nobody's home.

04:58.331 --> 04:59.666
They're gone.

05:02.636 --> 05:04.371
So it was an ambush.

05:04.404 --> 05:08.642
Okay, so well, you think
him and Max had them
wait here for us?

05:08.675 --> 05:11.244
Until the vampires got to them.

05:11.278 --> 05:14.714
We're gonna have to keep
our eye out for that, as well.

05:14.748 --> 05:18.418
You know, I saw this bus leaving
the prison the day we broke in.

05:18.451 --> 05:19.886
You sure?

05:19.920 --> 05:20.554
Oh yeah.

05:23.290 --> 05:24.457
It was filled with
injured prisoners

05:24.491 --> 05:26.326
and old people.

05:26.359 --> 05:27.928
Son of a bitch.

05:28.461 --> 05:29.262
What?

05:29.296 --> 05:32.032
What're you...
what're you thinking?

05:32.632 --> 05:34.234
Oh, Jesus Christ.

05:34.267 --> 05:35.268
, come on, Axel!

05:35.302 --> 05:36.303
Give me something here!

05:36.336 --> 05:37.270
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

05:37.304 --> 05:38.305
Listen, listen, listen.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.739
!

05:39.773 --> 05:42.242
He doesn't need them as
a hostage anymore, right?

05:42.275 --> 05:43.443
Jennifer or Owen.

05:43.476 --> 05:44.444
Right?

05:44.477 --> 05:45.979
They're just a pain in the ass
at this point

05:46.012 --> 05:48.648
so if he knows we're after them

05:48.682 --> 05:51.785
why wouldn't he just drop them
off on the side of the road?

05:51.818 --> 05:52.619
Right.

05:52.652 --> 05:55.755
We find them we‐
we stop chasing him.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.924
Exactly. We're out
of his hair for good.

05:57.958 --> 06:00.760
So why set an ambush?

06:00.794 --> 06:02.329
He's a... he's a psychopath,
Axel,

06:02.362 --> 06:03.697
he doesn't think like
you and I, alright?

06:03.730 --> 06:04.598
He's a crazy person.

06:04.631 --> 06:06.700
He may be crackers
but he's not stupid.

06:06.733 --> 06:11.037
If he's keeping them
it's for a reason.

06:11.071 --> 06:12.772
Why do you think?

06:12.806 --> 06:15.442
Oh, I don't know, but...

06:15.475 --> 06:16.576
like these prisoners
on the bus,

06:16.610 --> 06:21.848
it didn't matter if they were
small or old or sick.

06:21.882 --> 06:23.783
He's using Jennifer and the kid
for the same thing

06:23.817 --> 06:26.319
he was using these people for.

06:26.353 --> 06:27.520
We're closing in on him, though.

06:27.554 --> 06:28.588
These bodies are fresh.

06:28.622 --> 06:30.724
Okay, I can't go through
this again, Axel, alright?

06:30.757 --> 06:31.591
We're not gonna lose 'em.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.059
I'm not gonna go on like this,
alright?

06:33.093 --> 06:34.060
We're gonna find 'em!

06:34.094 --> 06:35.061
This whole thing seems bad!

06:35.095 --> 06:37.063
The whole thing seems‐

06:37.097 --> 06:38.565
Down! Down!

06:38.598 --> 06:40.433
[gunshot]

06:42.636 --> 06:43.637
That's a gunshot.

06:43.670 --> 06:44.638
Shh!

06:44.671 --> 06:45.772
It's them.

06:45.805 --> 06:47.807
Phil's not ever gonna give up
on us, you know that.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.910
He broke into a prison
to find us.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.011
He let you do what
you did‐

06:51.044 --> 06:54.347
Shut up.

06:54.381 --> 06:55.615
Just let us go.

06:55.649 --> 06:58.585
Then I'll stop bothering you and
Phil won't blow your head off.

06:58.618 --> 07:01.855
Oh, cute. Get back in the truck.

07:01.888 --> 07:02.889
I have to pee.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.892
Get back in the truck!

07:08.128 --> 07:09.729
Bye, bye...

07:18.138 --> 07:20.407
It's gonna be alright, okay?

07:20.440 --> 07:22.108
We've always been fine
in the end,

07:22.142 --> 07:24.411
we're gonna be fine
this time, too.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.012
We have to kill him.

07:26.046 --> 07:29.049
Shhh.

07:29.082 --> 07:32.719
Don't you cause any trouble,
you hear me?

07:32.752 --> 07:38.658
You do as I say,
when I say, okay?

07:41.895 --> 07:43.830
Heroes.

07:44.664 --> 07:46.433
Pain in my goddamn ass.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.905
[laughs]

07:51.938 --> 07:52.939
Ah.

07:52.973 --> 07:55.408
Move on over. You're driving.

07:55.442 --> 07:57.577
Owen, put on your seatbelt.
Right now.

07:57.610 --> 07:59.012
Fast. Hurry up.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.717
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.
Come on, baby.

08:03.750 --> 08:04.718
Come on, baby.

08:04.751 --> 08:05.652
Hey.

08:05.685 --> 08:09.723
You are gonna hang on
super tight, okay?

08:09.756 --> 08:11.591
[sniffing]

08:23.603 --> 08:24.704
Where to?

08:24.738 --> 08:27.574
Just keep driving straight
till I tell you otherwise.

08:27.607 --> 08:29.109
[sniffing]

08:32.979 --> 08:34.547
Wait.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.688
Why don't you get comfortable,
little buddy?

08:41.721 --> 08:45.125
There's no need for seatbelts
when your mom is driving, right?

08:46.626 --> 08:48.628
Do as he says, honey.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.800
Nice try.

09:09.983 --> 09:12.085
See up there?

09:12.118 --> 09:13.920
What the hell is that?

09:15.522 --> 09:16.956
A body.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.240
Stop the truck.

09:34.274 --> 09:35.542
Stop the truck!

10:07.774 --> 10:08.741
It's not them!

10:08.775 --> 10:10.543
Feeders, all of 'em.

10:10.577 --> 10:11.644
They're not looking their best.

10:11.678 --> 10:14.714
I guess the daywalkers
haven't made it this far yet.

10:14.747 --> 10:18.885
No, they're all burned to
a crisp and put on display.

10:18.918 --> 10:19.886
Someone's sending a message.

10:19.919 --> 10:22.922
Yeah, it's a message for feeders
from feeders.

10:22.956 --> 10:23.990
Is that a guess?

10:24.023 --> 10:26.593
No, Julius used to do this
to mark our territory.

10:26.626 --> 10:28.695
A warning to other kinds.

10:28.728 --> 10:30.029
Other kinds?

10:30.763 --> 10:33.099
[screeching in the distance]

10:34.634 --> 10:36.903
That sounded awfully close.

10:40.173 --> 10:41.040
[screeching]

10:41.074 --> 10:43.009
Ho! Ho, ho. Ho.

10:43.042 --> 10:44.210
Human!

10:44.244 --> 10:46.946
Which is your toll?

10:46.980 --> 10:47.747
Oh, he means us.

10:47.780 --> 10:50.250
We have to pay our way
in blood.

10:50.283 --> 10:52.752
Which pays the price?

10:52.785 --> 10:53.786
Shit.

10:58.758 --> 11:01.161
If he doesn't get one of us
he's gonna take both.

11:01.194 --> 11:03.229
That doesn't sound good.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.664
Alright, look, we book it
for the truck.

11:04.697 --> 11:06.799
We get there, I got your six.

11:06.833 --> 11:07.800
You're driving.

11:07.834 --> 11:08.902
‐Now?
‐Now.

11:08.968 --> 11:10.003
Run!

11:10.036 --> 11:11.838
Kill them!

11:11.871 --> 11:13.273
[gunfire]

11:15.208 --> 11:18.111
[snarling and screeching]

11:18.978 --> 11:20.780
[gunshot]

11:24.450 --> 11:25.618
Come on!

11:26.152 --> 11:28.354
Come on.

11:28.388 --> 11:29.923
[gunfire]

11:29.956 --> 11:31.257
Come on!

11:31.291 --> 11:32.892
Come on!

11:34.661 --> 11:35.895
[gunfire]

11:38.965 --> 11:40.700
[screeching]

11:40.733 --> 11:41.901
[gunfire]

11:41.935 --> 11:43.269
[gunfire]

11:48.208 --> 11:49.275
Oh, shit!

11:49.309 --> 11:50.343
Jesus Christ!

11:51.144 --> 11:52.111
Son of a bitch!

11:52.145 --> 11:53.112
Shit, shit, shit!

11:53.146 --> 11:54.180
Go full bore, buddy!

11:54.214 --> 11:55.882
They're coming in hot!

11:55.915 --> 12:00.386
[growling and snarling]

12:06.492 --> 12:08.127
[gunshot]

12:08.161 --> 12:09.162
Don't waste your bullets.

12:10.630 --> 12:11.564
[gunshot]

12:12.532 --> 12:13.600
[gunshot]

12:14.434 --> 12:15.401
[gunshot]

12:15.435 --> 12:18.304
[gunfire]

12:21.808 --> 12:23.009
[gunshot]

12:23.676 --> 12:25.011
[gunshot]

12:26.646 --> 12:28.214
Careful with your ammo!

12:28.248 --> 12:31.017
[gunfire]

12:31.050 --> 12:31.918
[gunshot]

12:35.755 --> 12:37.790
[struggling grunts]

12:39.192 --> 12:42.528
[gunfire]

12:43.363 --> 12:44.364
Axel!

12:46.766 --> 12:47.467
Heads‐up, buddy!

12:47.500 --> 12:50.670
This is gonna leave a mark!

12:50.703 --> 12:53.373
[explosion]

12:56.276 --> 12:58.711
You were right about
that husband of yours.

12:58.745 --> 13:01.714
Persistent son of a bitch, but
that's a way bigger bomb than...

13:04.517 --> 13:05.585
Woah, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey!

13:05.618 --> 13:07.353
Easy, easy, easy.

13:07.387 --> 13:10.056
Shoot me and say goodbye
to your best friend.

13:10.089 --> 13:10.990
Give it to me.

13:11.024 --> 13:13.293
Drop the gun.

13:20.233 --> 13:21.334
Okay.

13:21.367 --> 13:22.669
Give me the drugs.

13:22.702 --> 13:24.404
Owen, listen to me.

13:24.437 --> 13:25.705
That man who helped us
at the mine?

13:25.738 --> 13:27.273
He's down in the valley.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.708
I want you to run that way
and keep running,

13:28.741 --> 13:30.510
you understand?

13:32.312 --> 13:33.279
Go.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.580
Now.

13:38.251 --> 13:39.018
Come on, give me the drugs.

13:39.052 --> 13:40.453
Give me the drugs! Now!

13:40.486 --> 13:42.455
Not until he's safe.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.190
Your husband's dead, sweetheart.

13:44.223 --> 13:45.692
The kid's running to no one.

13:45.725 --> 13:46.726
Phil can't die.

13:46.759 --> 13:48.261
You know that better than me.

13:48.294 --> 13:50.096
He certainly can if his head's
burned right off,

13:50.129 --> 13:51.798
and judging by that explosion.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.399
Wishful thinking.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.371
Okay.

13:58.404 --> 14:00.106
Maybe your husband made it.

14:00.139 --> 14:03.543
Even so, it's getting dark,
honey.

14:03.576 --> 14:06.312
You have no idea what's waiting
for that kid in the dark.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.881
There are things that have live
in these canyons for years.

14:08.915 --> 14:09.982
Adapting, learning,

14:10.016 --> 14:14.454
figuring out ways to survive
when there aren't any.

14:14.487 --> 14:17.290
Feed off a lost survivors,
trailer trash

14:17.323 --> 14:22.228
who try to live out here,
little kids on the run.

14:22.261 --> 14:25.398
You don't get a good meal
very often, you know.

14:25.431 --> 14:27.600
So maybe, you know, maybe
they'll turn your little boy,

14:27.633 --> 14:30.770
but they'll probably
just drink him dry.

14:30.803 --> 14:34.140
Woah, hey.

14:34.173 --> 14:36.576
He gets lost.

14:36.609 --> 14:38.177
If he doesn't find your husband

14:38.211 --> 14:41.381
he finds his charred,
decapitated remains.

14:46.652 --> 14:48.187
Plenty of ways for him
to die out there,

14:48.221 --> 14:51.324
all of them on you.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.829
Owen, stop!

15:03.836 --> 15:07.173
You know, you are very lucky
that I need you alive.

15:07.206 --> 15:08.174
Oh yeah?

15:08.207 --> 15:09.342
Yeah.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.312
[jar shatters]

15:13.346 --> 15:15.481
Thanks for the tip.

15:18.818 --> 15:19.786
You need me alive, right?

15:19.819 --> 15:21.220
You said so yourself.

15:21.254 --> 15:24.323
That means both of us,
right?

15:24.357 --> 15:25.491
What do you want us for,
anyway?

15:25.525 --> 15:27.693
Where are you taking us?

15:30.530 --> 15:32.265
[screams in rage]

15:44.844 --> 15:47.580
[ears ringing]

15:47.613 --> 15:48.748
Hey.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.316
Welcome back.

15:50.349 --> 15:53.853
[groans]

15:57.723 --> 16:01.694
What'd I miss?

16:01.727 --> 16:04.397
The good news is the explosion
killed the vamps.

16:04.430 --> 16:05.832
Except for that first one,
I think he slipped away.

16:05.865 --> 16:07.033
Right.

16:07.066 --> 16:08.835
And?

16:08.868 --> 16:11.370
And I think I heard something
up there just now.

16:11.404 --> 16:13.339
What?

16:13.372 --> 16:14.540
A woman yelling.

16:14.574 --> 16:15.741
Where?

16:15.775 --> 16:17.310
Up there.

16:17.810 --> 16:18.911
It's close, I just‐

16:18.945 --> 16:20.379
I can't spot 'em.

16:20.413 --> 16:22.682
They definitely saw that
fireball, though.

16:22.715 --> 16:24.417
Then he knows
we're following him.

16:24.450 --> 16:25.852
Or were.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.954
We could use that to
our advantage, maybe.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.289
Look, if we head out now
we can get there before dark.

16:30.323 --> 16:31.958
No, I don't think so.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.359
Rhonda's shot.

16:33.392 --> 16:35.394
Both the gas tanks blew out.

16:37.763 --> 16:39.265
Well, I mean, there's no‐

16:39.298 --> 16:42.835
there's no way to get there
on foot.

16:42.869 --> 16:44.904
Their fuel's not gonna
last forever, either.

16:44.937 --> 16:46.906
We walk all night.

16:46.939 --> 16:49.041
We'll find 'em.

16:49.075 --> 16:51.978
You're willing to do that?

16:52.011 --> 16:53.646
Of course.

16:53.679 --> 16:55.081
We don't know what the hell's
out there.

16:55.114 --> 16:57.083
We might not make it
through the night.

16:57.116 --> 16:59.919
Death doesn't scare me anymore,
man.

16:59.952 --> 17:01.954
Life, on the other hand...

17:09.128 --> 17:11.597
That belonged to Scarlett,
right?

17:11.631 --> 17:13.566
Vanessa's sister.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.735
Leave it.

17:15.768 --> 17:18.104
Listen, Axel, this hole
you're in now,

17:18.137 --> 17:20.673
I've... I've been there, too.

17:20.706 --> 17:23.476
You'll get out of it.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.778
Not until I put this right.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.581
We will.

17:32.652 --> 17:36.455
Well, we got a long walk.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.991
And wherever they're going
we better get there first.

18:22.768 --> 18:23.803
Come on.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.371
It's not safe out here.

18:38.351 --> 18:39.518
Are you sure that's
a good idea?

18:39.552 --> 18:41.387
[sniffing]

18:41.654 --> 18:42.822
Ow!

18:42.855 --> 18:44.724
Jesus mother...

18:45.658 --> 18:46.659
Come on. Come on.

18:46.692 --> 18:48.828
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

18:48.861 --> 18:53.599
Remember, you leave the house,
your kid dies.

18:53.633 --> 18:56.636
Simple as that.

18:56.669 --> 18:58.371
Great.

18:58.404 --> 19:00.673
Now, rest up.

19:00.706 --> 19:02.742
Hell of a big day tomorrow.

19:05.478 --> 19:06.979
[blows nose]

19:08.748 --> 19:10.850
The town looks completely
abandoned.

19:10.883 --> 19:12.018
Yeah.

19:12.051 --> 19:16.555
Any human from miles around
would go there to hole up.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.791
And Max.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.594
Get some sleep, okay?

19:24.263 --> 19:27.967
Tell me about before.

19:30.236 --> 19:31.771
Okay.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.709
Before you were born,

19:36.742 --> 19:39.812
when you were just little
in mommy's tummy,

19:39.845 --> 19:42.548
there were no vampires.

19:42.581 --> 19:46.652
And you had a brother
and a sister

19:46.686 --> 19:49.422
who could play in the grass
and look at the stars

19:49.455 --> 19:51.557
without any fear.

19:51.590 --> 19:54.593
But they're gone now?

19:54.627 --> 19:57.563
Yeah, they're gone now.

19:57.596 --> 20:03.536
But they lived a life
you can't even imagine.

20:03.569 --> 20:07.506
A life filled with happiness
and joy,

20:07.540 --> 20:10.609
and a life that was safe
and warm,

20:10.643 --> 20:14.013
and one day that life
will come back and be yours.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.014
Really?

20:15.047 --> 20:16.582
Really.

20:16.615 --> 20:19.452
The sun will shine
and you'll go to school

20:19.485 --> 20:21.721
and your friends will come over
and play

20:21.754 --> 20:24.757
and you'll have cake and
presents on your birthday.

20:24.790 --> 20:26.926
When?

20:26.959 --> 20:30.362
Someday.

20:30.396 --> 20:34.300
But until then we survive.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.268
Every day.

20:36.302 --> 20:42.108
We stay safe and stay smart
so we'll be alive

20:42.141 --> 20:44.810
when the world's the way
it was before.

20:44.844 --> 20:46.512
Okay?

20:52.451 --> 20:53.452
Mom?

20:53.486 --> 20:54.220
Yeah?

20:54.253 --> 20:56.422
Is the man still helping?

20:56.455 --> 20:59.024
Is he going to come?

21:03.429 --> 21:05.564
Yeah, he is.

21:29.021 --> 21:29.955
[groans]

21:29.989 --> 21:30.990
Axel!

21:31.023 --> 21:33.659
[snarling]

21:33.692 --> 21:36.829
[groans]

21:41.000 --> 21:43.636
You should have paid the toll!

21:45.538 --> 21:48.507
[cries out in pain]
Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!

22:17.002 --> 22:18.871
[floor creaks]

22:37.623 --> 22:39.191
[gunshot]

22:41.026 --> 22:43.462
Little shit!

22:46.265 --> 22:47.600
Owen!

22:47.633 --> 22:48.634
Owen!

22:50.069 --> 22:52.538
The little shot me!

22:52.571 --> 22:54.240
No, don't! He's just a kid!

22:54.273 --> 22:56.909
Yeah, well it still
hurts, doesn't it?

22:56.942 --> 22:58.577
You need him, Max.

22:58.611 --> 23:00.079
Okay? Just calm down.

23:00.112 --> 23:01.213
You need him alive, right?

23:01.247 --> 23:03.048
Don't‐ don't screw
yourself over.

23:03.082 --> 23:06.819
He shot me in the neck!

23:07.987 --> 23:09.989
You need him.

23:17.830 --> 23:19.164
!

23:19.732 --> 23:21.100
Alright, get over here.

23:21.133 --> 23:22.868
Go to your bed, now!

23:22.902 --> 23:24.603
Ow!

23:29.942 --> 23:32.211
You were one of them,
weren't you?

23:32.244 --> 23:34.947
Like Phil.

23:34.980 --> 23:37.716
Oh yeah, best time of my life.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.218
I was always a night owl anyway,
you know,

23:39.251 --> 23:44.990
so losing the sun was never
a big deal.

23:45.024 --> 23:50.062
Never get to sleep,
party never stops.

23:50.095 --> 23:51.897
And blood?

23:51.931 --> 23:53.933
Best high ever.

23:58.003 --> 23:59.905
Get the kid. We're going.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.607
But it's still dark out.
Didn't you‐

24:01.640 --> 24:02.808
Now!

24:02.841 --> 24:05.044
Now! Go!

24:11.984 --> 24:13.719
Where the hell are my keys?

24:14.887 --> 24:17.957
Oh, come on, where the
are my keys?

24:22.127 --> 24:24.163
[crash]

24:24.196 --> 24:25.297
[screams]

24:35.207 --> 24:38.911
[groans]

24:48.087 --> 24:51.623
Why does your blood not flow?

24:51.657 --> 24:53.258
It's a long story.

24:56.061 --> 25:01.767
[screams in pain]
Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!

25:02.201 --> 25:03.836
No!

25:03.869 --> 25:06.638
[screaming]
Ahhhhhh!!!!!!!

25:06.672 --> 25:07.639
Axel!!!

25:07.673 --> 25:09.842
We gotta get out of here!
We're so close!

25:11.010 --> 25:12.144
Hey! Hey!

25:12.177 --> 25:13.679
You ugly son of a bitch,
come here!

25:13.712 --> 25:16.582
If you're so
goddamn thirsty.

25:16.615 --> 25:18.650
Come on, go for the jugular.

25:19.785 --> 25:21.820
[screeching]

25:21.854 --> 25:23.689
Oh, Jesus Christ.

25:23.722 --> 25:25.090
What the hell are you?

25:25.124 --> 25:27.593
[screeching]

25:27.626 --> 25:31.830
[groans]

25:33.232 --> 25:37.302
[grunts]

25:43.742 --> 25:45.310
Hold him down!

25:56.288 --> 25:58.757
Axel, we gotta go.
We...

25:58.791 --> 26:00.092
It's almost dawn.

26:00.125 --> 26:01.760
We're gonna lose them
if we don't go now.

26:01.794 --> 26:03.095
Hey, hey, hey.

26:03.128 --> 26:05.097
Just give me a minute.

26:07.299 --> 26:09.301
I got an idea.

26:19.144 --> 26:20.646
[whispers] They're here.
They're still here.

26:20.679 --> 26:22.681
Okay, stay cool.
This is no time to freak out.

26:23.949 --> 26:24.716
Hey!

26:27.586 --> 26:29.655
‐I go first.
‐I go first.

26:29.688 --> 26:30.689
Okay.

26:31.523 --> 26:32.691
[gunshot]

26:32.724 --> 26:33.759
[gunshot]

26:37.896 --> 26:38.864
Shit!

26:39.698 --> 26:41.433
[gunshot]

26:42.801 --> 26:44.002
Son of a bitch!

26:44.903 --> 26:45.871
[gunshot]

26:45.904 --> 26:46.638
Stay down!

26:46.672 --> 26:47.539
He knows he can't kill me!

26:47.573 --> 26:50.008
Yeah, but he knows he can
slow you down.

26:50.042 --> 26:51.844
[gunshot]

26:53.679 --> 26:55.547
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

26:55.581 --> 26:57.049
He's tucked in between
those two buildings over there.

26:57.082 --> 26:59.485
[gunshot]

27:01.787 --> 27:02.955
What're you doing?!

27:02.988 --> 27:03.989
[gunshot]

27:04.022 --> 27:05.657
Axel!

27:06.758 --> 27:08.694
What'd you do that for?!

27:08.727 --> 27:10.829
He saw me.

27:10.863 --> 27:12.564
He thinks I'm dead for sure now.

27:12.598 --> 27:13.732
He doesn't know
I have what you‐

27:13.765 --> 27:14.967
[gunshot]

27:20.072 --> 27:21.607
Whew!

27:21.640 --> 27:22.841
A!

27:22.875 --> 27:24.710
Got a bonus kill on that one.

27:24.743 --> 27:25.711
Too bad, too.

27:25.744 --> 27:27.846
I liked that guy
before he tried to kill me.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.014
You know that's not gonna
stop Phil.

27:29.047 --> 27:31.917
Yeah, but it'll buy me
some time.

27:31.950 --> 27:33.018
We're going to Matty's.

27:33.051 --> 27:34.086
Who's Matty?

27:34.119 --> 27:35.020
Don't you worry about it.

27:35.053 --> 27:37.022
You'll have a very formal
introduction.

27:37.055 --> 27:38.223
Let's go!

27:58.010 --> 27:59.211
Left.

28:15.794 --> 28:17.963
You cause any trouble I kill
the kid right here, right now.

28:17.996 --> 28:19.565
You understand?

28:20.599 --> 28:21.733
Good.

28:23.235 --> 28:25.938
Matty! It's me, Max!

28:25.971 --> 28:27.206
[knocking]
Open up!

28:27.673 --> 28:29.041
Matty!

28:31.210 --> 28:32.311
Max.

28:32.344 --> 28:34.112
What the hell are you
doing here?

28:34.146 --> 28:36.648
Why don't you get the hell
out here and find out?

28:36.682 --> 28:37.950
Come on.

28:42.020 --> 28:43.655
I need some of that fatty
blood you got.

28:43.689 --> 28:45.157
Best of the bunch.

28:45.190 --> 28:46.825
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

28:46.858 --> 28:47.859
No, I made a deal
with your men.

28:47.893 --> 28:51.530
We're all squared up now,
up to date and done.

28:51.563 --> 28:53.165
Well, something came up.

28:53.198 --> 28:55.834
I need to get over the hills, I
gotta pay the piper on the way.

28:55.867 --> 28:58.637
I got... I got other customers,
you know?

28:58.670 --> 29:00.939
Hungriest biters in these parts.

29:00.973 --> 29:02.674
Can't spare no more.

29:02.708 --> 29:06.144
No more your way,
no way.

29:07.846 --> 29:08.614
Matty.

29:11.650 --> 29:13.685
You really wanna
turn that down?

29:14.653 --> 29:16.121
Right up your alley,
meek as a kitten,

29:16.154 --> 29:17.689
easy to handle.

29:17.723 --> 29:20.826
Didn't cause me any trouble
on the road.

29:20.859 --> 29:23.895
She doesn't have much meat
on her bones.

29:23.929 --> 29:24.763
You can take care of that,

29:24.796 --> 29:26.898
that's kind of your specialty,
right?

29:26.932 --> 29:28.667
What do you say?

29:29.801 --> 29:31.203
Throw in the boy,
you got a deal.

29:31.236 --> 29:34.006
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no.

29:34.039 --> 29:36.041
I got plans for him, okay?

29:37.075 --> 29:39.111
Both of them or we're done.

29:39.144 --> 29:40.379
Wanna bet on that?

29:40.412 --> 29:41.980
'Cause you know
I love to gamble!

29:42.014 --> 29:42.948
No, no, no!

29:42.981 --> 29:45.250
You kill me, you're never gonna
make it out

29:45.284 --> 29:47.085
of the badlands alive.

29:47.119 --> 29:48.920
The vamps will revenge ya.

29:48.954 --> 29:51.757
They need me and you know it.

29:51.790 --> 29:52.758
Do I?

29:56.628 --> 29:59.064
What's a little game of sport
between friends, right?

29:59.097 --> 30:00.299
Oh god!

30:00.799 --> 30:02.067
Gotcha. Your turn.

30:02.100 --> 30:04.169
Pay or play, Matty.
What's it gonna be?

30:05.704 --> 30:07.005
Deal.

30:07.039 --> 30:08.173
Sweet.

30:08.206 --> 30:10.175
No problem.

30:12.911 --> 30:13.879
Give me the kid.

30:13.912 --> 30:14.813
No.

30:14.846 --> 30:15.914
It's coming with me.
You're staying here.

30:15.947 --> 30:17.382
No! No!

30:17.416 --> 30:19.084
Stop! Stop!

30:19.117 --> 30:21.119
Easy! Listen to me!

30:21.420 --> 30:23.055
You lost!

30:23.088 --> 30:23.922
Okay? Good fight.

30:23.955 --> 30:26.024
You put up a good fight,
but you lost.

30:26.058 --> 30:27.659
No.

30:28.093 --> 30:31.229
Do you want him to see you
die first? Huh?

30:31.263 --> 30:33.865
Would that be better?

30:33.899 --> 30:35.133
You're not stupid.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.735
You know that's the only
choice here.

30:36.768 --> 30:38.303
Either you let him leave here
with me

30:38.337 --> 30:40.639
or he watches me tear you
apart first.

30:40.672 --> 30:42.207
What's it gonna be?

30:44.910 --> 30:46.778
Let me say goodbye.

30:47.813 --> 30:49.848
Tell him to behave himself.

30:54.820 --> 30:56.822
Owen, come here, honey.

30:59.758 --> 31:02.294
You're gonna have to go
with Max for a little bit.

31:02.327 --> 31:05.764
It won't be long, I promise,
okay?

31:05.797 --> 31:08.734
Just go with Max and stay
out of trouble.

31:10.168 --> 31:11.803
Give me the jars.

31:11.837 --> 31:14.373
Give them to me in a bag
or something.

31:17.008 --> 31:19.177
As soon as he gets drunk again

31:19.211 --> 31:22.314
you run back here
as fast as you can.

31:22.347 --> 31:25.384
[whispers]
I will get him, mom.

31:26.818 --> 31:28.420
I know you will.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.856
[sobbing]

31:32.858 --> 31:36.228
Pitter patter,
let's get at 'er.

31:39.531 --> 31:41.266
Have fun, Matty.

31:42.167 --> 31:45.837
[sobbing]

31:49.841 --> 31:51.276
Come on.

31:52.310 --> 31:54.279
If you try to kill me I swear
to god you'll get more

31:54.312 --> 31:57.716
than you bargained for.

31:57.749 --> 31:59.985
I'm not gonna kill you, honey.

32:00.018 --> 32:00.819
God no.

32:00.852 --> 32:03.755
Not for a good,
long while at least.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.158
Open up.

32:07.325 --> 32:08.960
In you go.

32:20.038 --> 32:20.672
[banging]

32:20.705 --> 32:22.040
Hello!

32:22.073 --> 32:24.009
[banging]

32:24.042 --> 32:25.177
Hello!

32:25.210 --> 32:26.711
Woah, woah, woah there.

32:26.745 --> 32:28.213
Ha. Woah.

32:28.246 --> 32:30.081
Give me a second.

32:34.186 --> 32:35.220
Got me at an awkward
moment there,

32:35.253 --> 32:36.855
if you know what I mean.

32:36.888 --> 32:39.057
What're you doing
all the way out here?

32:39.090 --> 32:40.659
Minding my own business.

32:40.692 --> 32:42.160
I suggest you do the same.

32:42.194 --> 32:43.395
I'm looking for a woman
and her son.

32:43.428 --> 32:44.196
Have you seen them?

32:44.229 --> 32:45.797
I think you might have
seen them.

32:45.831 --> 32:47.866
I don't know who you're
talking about.

32:47.899 --> 32:49.201
No one but me here.

32:49.234 --> 32:51.970
See, that's the way
I like it.

32:52.003 --> 32:52.971
[cocks gun]

32:53.004 --> 32:53.972
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

32:54.005 --> 32:55.407
Easy now.

32:55.440 --> 32:57.142
Drop the weapon.

32:58.109 --> 32:59.144
Drop it.

32:59.177 --> 32:59.978
Okay.

33:00.011 --> 33:01.913
You cry out, you die.
You got me?

33:01.947 --> 33:02.914
Uh huh.

33:02.948 --> 33:04.749
Are they inside?

33:04.783 --> 33:05.750
They're gone.

33:05.784 --> 33:08.653
Took some water and headed off,
both of them.

33:09.020 --> 33:10.755
Axel, look at that gear.

33:10.789 --> 33:12.824
The prisoners in the bus.

33:16.061 --> 33:17.028
Alright, the truth this time.

33:17.062 --> 33:18.230
Are they inside?

33:18.263 --> 33:20.165
I already told you,
they're gone.

33:20.699 --> 33:21.333
Flesh, hold up. Hold up!

33:21.366 --> 33:22.267
Owen!

33:22.300 --> 33:24.202
You don't want him
to go in there alone.

33:24.236 --> 33:26.071
Owen! Jennifer!

33:26.104 --> 33:26.671
On your knees. Now!

33:26.705 --> 33:28.073
Okay! Okay.

33:28.106 --> 33:29.341
Owen!

33:33.211 --> 33:34.679
Jennifer?

33:41.987 --> 33:43.255
Jennifer?

34:06.912 --> 34:08.847
Jennifer!

34:10.248 --> 34:11.750
Jennifer!

34:11.783 --> 34:13.118
Owen!

34:13.952 --> 34:15.253
Jennifer!

34:15.820 --> 34:17.088
Owen!

34:18.523 --> 34:19.991
Jennifer!

34:20.025 --> 34:21.893
Jen!

34:21.927 --> 34:24.162
Owen!

34:24.195 --> 34:26.998
[muffled screaming]

34:27.032 --> 34:29.034
Jennifer?

34:29.067 --> 34:34.172
[muffled screaming]

34:34.205 --> 34:36.174
Jennifer?

34:36.207 --> 34:42.280
[muffled screaming]

34:56.194 --> 34:58.129
Jennifer!

34:59.030 --> 35:00.765
Owen!

35:02.968 --> 35:07.105
[muffled screaming]

35:07.806 --> 35:09.274
I can give you all the blood
you need.

35:09.307 --> 35:10.375
Fatty blood.

35:10.408 --> 35:13.111
They love that shit.
They can feed off it for days.

35:13.144 --> 35:15.113
Where's Max?

35:15.146 --> 35:17.816
You know what he'll do to me.
He'll kill me slow.

35:17.849 --> 35:19.217
He'll... he'll cut me alive.

35:19.250 --> 35:21.219
I could kill you right now,
how'd that be?

35:21.252 --> 35:23.054
[thud]

35:23.088 --> 35:24.522
Where are they?!

35:24.556 --> 35:26.024
Jennifer!

35:27.425 --> 35:28.827
Jennifer!

35:28.860 --> 35:29.894
[muffled screams]

35:29.928 --> 35:32.030
Jennifer!

35:33.565 --> 35:35.467
I got you.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.769
Don't worry, I got you.

35:40.238 --> 35:41.206
It's okay, it's okay.

35:41.239 --> 35:42.207
Max took Owen!

35:42.240 --> 35:43.375
It's okay. You're gonna be okay.

35:43.408 --> 35:44.409
He took him!

35:44.442 --> 35:45.977
We have to‐

35:46.544 --> 35:48.546
Come on, we gotta go.
Let's go!

35:49.547 --> 35:51.249
Okay, that's all I know,
I promise.

35:51.282 --> 35:54.519
I swear. You pay the toll
and you get across.

35:54.552 --> 35:55.654
They're headed for the river.

35:55.687 --> 35:58.056
This asshole's got a pick‐up
truck in the shed.

35:58.089 --> 36:01.026
Supposed to be some kind of
vampire‐free promised land.

36:01.059 --> 36:02.894
This man is a
psychopath.

36:02.927 --> 36:03.895
Come on now‐

36:03.928 --> 36:04.896
[gunshot]

36:05.964 --> 36:07.866
Let's go.

36:12.137 --> 36:14.072
Stop dragging your feet.

36:14.105 --> 36:15.206
Let me go!

36:15.240 --> 36:19.077
Oh, don't you worry, you'll be
rid of me soon enough.

36:19.110 --> 36:20.945
Look. Mmm.

36:20.979 --> 36:22.113
Kid.

36:22.147 --> 36:25.583
I know that life has taken
a bad turn on you recently.

36:25.617 --> 36:29.521
I feel bad about that,
really I do.

36:29.554 --> 36:32.891
Look, I was a kid
like you once.

36:32.924 --> 36:34.926
I know what it feels like
when everything turns shitty,

36:34.959 --> 36:36.961
and trust me.

36:36.995 --> 36:39.330
You'll like where we're going,
I promise.

36:40.331 --> 36:42.967
[cries out in pain]
Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!!

36:45.336 --> 36:46.237
Mom!

36:46.271 --> 36:47.572
Shit!

36:48.506 --> 36:49.474
You want some?!

36:49.507 --> 36:52.510
[gunshots]

36:54.279 --> 36:55.547
Owen!

36:56.915 --> 36:58.116
Goddammit!

36:59.317 --> 37:01.553
[screams in pain]

37:02.620 --> 37:04.923
Come and get it!

37:04.956 --> 37:06.091
I'm gonna take care of things
this time.

37:06.124 --> 37:07.158
You have to trust me.

37:07.192 --> 37:09.527
Go get our son.

37:22.073 --> 37:23.374
Woah, woah, woah,
woah, woah.

37:23.408 --> 37:25.543
Any closer and he dies.

37:25.577 --> 37:27.746
Hand him over!

37:28.413 --> 37:30.281
You really sure about that shot?

37:30.315 --> 37:31.382
I mean, sure.

37:31.416 --> 37:33.151
One to the head might put me
down for a little bit

37:33.184 --> 37:36.187
but what if you miss?

37:41.359 --> 37:42.327
See that?

37:42.360 --> 37:43.328
I got no choice.

37:43.361 --> 37:44.596
Neither do I!

37:44.629 --> 37:46.631
I have to pay the toll.

37:46.664 --> 37:48.767
He's coming with us!

37:48.800 --> 37:51.669
What is that supposed to be,
moxie?

37:51.703 --> 37:53.104
I hate moxie.

37:53.138 --> 37:57.642
Hey, hey. I got two
gallons of the fatty blood
and this little one.

37:57.675 --> 38:00.111
Okay? All I want
is safe passage.

38:00.145 --> 38:01.312
[gunshot]

38:01.780 --> 38:02.747
Woah!

38:02.781 --> 38:03.748
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah!

38:03.782 --> 38:05.416
Easy!

38:05.450 --> 38:07.452
You wanna bring the rest of them
down here?

38:08.953 --> 38:09.954
Hey, hey. Listen to me,
listen to me.

38:09.988 --> 38:13.324
I'm not with them, okay?
Do we have a deal?

38:15.460 --> 38:16.427
Sounds good.

38:16.461 --> 38:17.162
[gunshot]

38:17.195 --> 38:19.130
[screams]
Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!!

38:19.164 --> 38:20.431
Owen! Owen! Owen!

38:21.399 --> 38:22.433
Owen!

38:24.869 --> 38:26.471
[groans in pain]

38:26.504 --> 38:27.472
Hurts, doesn't it?

38:27.505 --> 38:28.439
[groans]

38:28.473 --> 38:29.774
You bastard.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.509
You sly bastard.

38:31.543 --> 38:32.877
I knew the second
I laid eyes on you

38:32.911 --> 38:34.612
you were one tough
son of a bitch.

38:34.646 --> 38:36.281
And I knew you were
an asshole.

38:36.314 --> 38:37.348
Whatever.

38:37.382 --> 38:39.450
That was then.

38:39.484 --> 38:41.319
So what?

38:41.352 --> 38:43.888
You gonna finish me?

38:43.922 --> 38:46.391
I was turned into a vampire
at the citadel.

38:46.424 --> 38:48.693
Turned by Dmitri himself.

38:48.726 --> 38:50.895
I turned back the day
of the rebellion attack

38:50.929 --> 38:55.200
by the one they whisper about.

38:55.233 --> 38:57.202
And then I was turned into
whatever the hell this is

38:57.235 --> 38:58.837
by a daywalker.

39:01.906 --> 39:03.474
Shit.

39:03.508 --> 39:04.642
Shit.

39:04.676 --> 39:07.645
Shit, shit, shit.

39:07.679 --> 39:11.316
I've been everything
you could be.

39:11.349 --> 39:13.451
May as well try dead.

39:14.552 --> 39:17.655
I'd like to oblige, but I
promised that privilege

39:17.689 --> 39:18.957
to someone else.

39:21.860 --> 39:25.196
[grunts]

39:26.297 --> 39:27.899
Don't look, it's okay.

39:37.542 --> 39:39.377
Well, that'll do 'er.

39:41.746 --> 39:43.514
Yeah.

39:46.050 --> 39:48.753
Rot in hell, Max.

39:48.786 --> 39:50.855
That's too good for him.

40:07.005 --> 40:10.375
Thank you.

40:10.408 --> 40:12.710
Just righting a wrong.

40:12.744 --> 40:15.280
The least I could do.

40:18.349 --> 40:20.551
The pain'll ease,
time helps.

40:20.585 --> 40:23.621
You don't think it will
but it does.

40:24.589 --> 40:26.591
My children, they're uh...

40:30.962 --> 40:33.865
they're still with me sometimes.

40:38.770 --> 40:41.472
What is this?

40:41.506 --> 40:42.440
I'm out.

40:42.473 --> 40:43.474
I'm done.

40:43.508 --> 40:45.610
I can't go back there.

40:46.711 --> 40:48.346
I'm not sure that's a choice
you get to make.

40:48.379 --> 40:49.514
I think it is.
