01:29.450 --> 01:31.785
Glasses.
I can't find my glasses.

01:33.621 --> 01:37.165
Not today.
Please, God, not today.

01:43.672 --> 01:45.798
Has anybody seen my glasses?

01:46.925 --> 01:48.801
Right here, Mr. Ben.

01:49.511 --> 01:51.178
Do you have the list?

01:52.931 --> 01:54.849
No, it's in the kitchen.

02:01.397 --> 02:04.524
I think 40 will cover it.

02:04.692 --> 02:06.818
Maybe you can send Eugenia
to the market.

02:06.986 --> 02:08.235
Okay.

02:08.404 --> 02:11.406
- How's the lasagna?
- Oh, I just put it in.

02:11.574 --> 02:12.949
It looks delicious.

02:13.117 --> 02:15.618
- Let me see.
- Sweetie, do you have any cash?

02:15.786 --> 02:18.496
- Not too early to put it in?
- I know what I'm doing.

02:18.664 --> 02:21.206
- Close the door and go.
- So how do I look?

02:21.374 --> 02:23.792
You look fantastic.

02:23.960 --> 02:26.753
- Both of you.
- It's almost 11. George, we have to go.

02:26.921 --> 02:29.381
- I'm waiting for you.
- I need cash for Eugenia.

02:29.549 --> 02:31.508
- You smell good too.
- Thank you.

02:31.676 --> 02:34.511
- Let's go. Thank you, Zlata.
- We'll be back about 1:30.

02:34.679 --> 02:38.640
- You got the papers?
- Yes, I've got them, Vera Vague. Let's go.

02:46.523 --> 02:47.857
They're all full, George.

02:48.025 --> 02:50.985
Don't worry. We'll still be okay.
Don't worry.

03:02.038 --> 03:04.539
We might have better luck on 6th.
Come on.

03:12.882 --> 03:14.799
Wait. George?

03:15.927 --> 03:18.553
- You all right?
- I don't want to get all sweaty.

03:20.722 --> 03:22.598
You look fine. You look fine.

03:24.768 --> 03:27.853
But we can't just wander.
We can't just wander.

03:28.021 --> 03:30.022
We should have hired a car service.

03:30.190 --> 03:32.399
Yes, you keep saying that.

03:33.610 --> 03:35.194
We are gathered here today...

03:35.362 --> 03:37.571
in the presence of these witnesses...

03:37.739 --> 03:40.907
with the purpose of uniting
in matrimony...

03:41.075 --> 03:43.785
George Esteban Garea...

03:43.953 --> 03:46.454
Benjamin Arthur Hull.

03:46.622 --> 03:48.957
Everybody who's here,
I'd like to ask you...

03:49.124 --> 03:53.878
to try to stop thinking about your jobs,
your marriage, your schoolwork...

03:54.046 --> 03:57.090
what you have to do tomorrow,
what you forgot today...

03:57.258 --> 04:00.551
and let us focus all of our energies...

04:00.718 --> 04:02.386
and all of our love...

04:02.554 --> 04:04.721
on these two men here:
George and Ben.

04:05.390 --> 04:07.182
So I'd like to ask of you...

04:07.350 --> 04:10.686
if you would commit
to honor and support...

04:10.853 --> 04:13.063
these two individuals...

04:13.231 --> 04:17.233
and their love and their life
and in their marriage together.

04:17.402 --> 04:19.902
- Yes, yes, yes!
- Yes!

04:20.070 --> 04:21.404
Yes!

04:21.572 --> 04:25.366
There is a question I have to ask
and it may seem obvious, the answer...

04:25.534 --> 04:28.202
but it's still a very
important question.

04:28.370 --> 04:31.539
Are you both making this decision
of your own free will?

04:33.417 --> 04:36.502
Yes.

04:37.212 --> 04:39.421
He's already weighing at me,
I only know.

04:39.589 --> 04:43.383
- What do you think? No, no.
- Come on, come on.

04:46.387 --> 04:47.887
Away.

04:48.514 --> 04:49.764
Would you like a cookie?

04:49.932 --> 04:52.350
Excuse me for interrupting you.
I made them.

04:52.518 --> 04:54.227
You made them for real? Sure.

04:57.857 --> 04:59.982
Excuse me. Roberto, would you like...?

05:00.150 --> 05:01.400
No, thank you.

05:03.945 --> 05:05.696
Thattaboy, Georgie.

05:21.462 --> 05:23.546
That's me he's talking about.

05:29.345 --> 05:31.888
Your part, Ted.
This is the sexy part.

05:36.894 --> 05:38.560
Oh, yeah.

06:09.007 --> 06:11.175
Okay, here we... Take it home now.

06:16.682 --> 06:18.390
Not just in the kitchen.

06:38.660 --> 06:40.536
Georgie, I love you!

06:41.788 --> 06:44.623
Guys, guys, guys. Quiet, quiet.

06:44.791 --> 06:46.792
I just wanna say something.

06:46.960 --> 06:49.920
When I met my husband...
My husband.

06:50.088 --> 06:52.965
Elliot here... he was walking around
with a camera...

06:53.133 --> 06:56.260
making amazing videos
with people he met on the street...

06:56.428 --> 06:59.887
creating scenes
out of ordinary situations.

07:00.055 --> 07:02.515
I was just finishing my first novel...

07:02.683 --> 07:05.893
and I immediately thought,
"We make a great pair. "

07:06.061 --> 07:10.273
Two independent spirits
committed to our art.

07:10.441 --> 07:11.816
So we started to go out...

07:11.984 --> 07:15.987
and he said that he wanted me
to meet his Uncle Ben.

07:16.155 --> 07:20.323
I said, "Well, why your uncle?" Elliot said
that since his mother had passed...

07:20.491 --> 07:23.160
his uncle was his favorite person
in his family.

07:23.327 --> 07:24.703
Thank you, Elliot.

07:24.871 --> 07:26.872
Not including siblings, Mindy.

07:28.207 --> 07:31.209
So we came here one night.

07:31.377 --> 07:33.962
You guys had just moved
into this apartment...

07:34.130 --> 07:38.549
and George had prepared us
a delicious spaghetti Bolognese.

07:38.717 --> 07:41.677
We drank wine and we sang...

07:41.845 --> 07:43.804
and we drank some more...

07:43.972 --> 07:48.142
and it was just wonderful.

07:48.310 --> 07:50.019
And when we left...

07:50.187 --> 07:53.773
Elliot said to me,
"I wanted you to meet the two of them...

07:53.940 --> 07:57.193
because they have been together
for more than 20 years. "

07:57.360 --> 07:59.360
So I understood...

08:00.654 --> 08:02.322
Oh, my, I'm going to cry.

08:02.490 --> 08:05.241
I understood that...

08:05.409 --> 08:09.746
That he was proposing to me
because you guys...

08:09.914 --> 08:13.166
Your love, your dedication,
your commitment to each other.

08:13.334 --> 08:15.376
Are an example to be followed.

08:15.544 --> 08:17.836
May this love, may this marriage...

08:18.004 --> 08:20.255
last forever and beyond.

08:20.423 --> 08:22.883
- To Ben and George.
- Thank you, Kate.

08:23.760 --> 08:25.719
- And to Petra!
- Petra!

08:25.887 --> 08:29.223
- Petra Von Kant!
- Petra, Petra! Petra, Petra!

09:15.309 --> 09:18.978
"All who serve in the archdiocese
should believe in God...

09:19.145 --> 09:21.730
support belief in Jesus Christ...

09:21.898 --> 09:23.566
engage in prayer...

09:23.733 --> 09:26.277
respect ecclesiastical authority...

09:26.444 --> 09:30.197
not take a public position
contrary to the Catholic Church... "

09:30.365 --> 09:33.117
Are you going to read me
the whole Witness Statement?

09:33.285 --> 09:35.452
The Christian Witness Statement,
George.

09:35.620 --> 09:38.413
You signed it when you took this job.

09:41.750 --> 09:43.626
How long have we known each other?

09:46.755 --> 09:50.508
Twelve years.

09:50.676 --> 09:53.219
- You have to understand that...
- Understand what?

09:53.387 --> 09:56.264
That day when you announced
you were getting married...

09:56.432 --> 09:58.265
at the spring semester meeting...

09:58.433 --> 10:01.435
You've all known
that Ben and I have been living together.

10:01.603 --> 10:04.146
Word got out to the archdiocese.

10:04.314 --> 10:06.732
Then someone showed pictures
to the bishop...

10:06.900 --> 10:09.359
of you and Ben in Petra.

10:09.986 --> 10:12.112
On Facebook, of all places.

10:12.280 --> 10:14.656
I wouldn't have done anything
any differently.

10:14.824 --> 10:17.408
I'm not saying you should have, George.

10:17.576 --> 10:19.493
But the bishop wasn't happy.

10:19.661 --> 10:21.621
And what about the students?

10:22.372 --> 10:26.000
I've known them since they were kids.
And their parents.

10:26.168 --> 10:28.377
They've been to my house,
played my piano.

10:28.545 --> 10:30.713
They've sung with Ben and me.

10:30.881 --> 10:34.008
The decision is effective immediately.

10:54.570 --> 10:57.446
George, let's pray.

11:01.284 --> 11:05.496
It's important
that you don't question your faith.

11:06.373 --> 11:08.207
Thank you very much, Father.

11:09.584 --> 11:13.212
I still believe in Jesus Christ as
my savior and that won't change...

11:13.380 --> 11:17.173
but at this moment,
I think I'd like to pray on my own.

11:29.019 --> 11:31.854
Well, let's not forget
that the real estate agent...

11:32.022 --> 11:34.023
gets a first-month commission.

11:34.191 --> 11:35.942
The co-op board gets a month...

11:36.110 --> 11:38.777
plus they charge
a 5 percent administration fee.

11:38.945 --> 11:42.864
A month? That's ridiculous. Why do
they charge an administration fee?

11:43.032 --> 11:46.493
- To discourage rentals in the building.
- I hate co-ops.

11:46.661 --> 11:49.496
- Hard to find a condo in Manhattan.
- Not true anymore.

11:49.664 --> 11:53.333
Anyway, we're trying to explain why
renting doesn't help us because...

11:53.501 --> 11:55.168
You've been to my house, right?

11:55.336 --> 11:57.628
You know how much
my real-estate taxes are?

11:57.796 --> 11:59.839
Three thousand. For the whole year.

12:00.007 --> 12:01.507
It's Poughkeepsie, Mindy.

12:01.675 --> 12:05.678
Renting would leave us owing
about a thousand a month.

12:05.846 --> 12:09.515
If we find a studio for, say, 1500...

12:09.683 --> 12:11.183
And that's very hard.

12:11.351 --> 12:14.061
I mean,
we're starting each month at 3000.

12:14.229 --> 12:15.980
And you can't afford that?

12:16.148 --> 12:19.357
Well, with my private lessons
and Ben's pension...

12:20.109 --> 12:22.485
Why did you guys go
on such a fancy honeymoon?

12:22.653 --> 12:24.446
Mindy! It's none of your business.

12:24.613 --> 12:27.282
Of course it is.
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.

12:27.450 --> 12:30.744
I'm just saying. There's nothing wrong
with Provincetown.

12:31.996 --> 12:33.705
- Have a seat.
- Everything okay?

12:33.873 --> 12:35.832
Yeah. Just wanted to talk to you.

12:38.710 --> 12:42.838
Now, we invited you all here today
because, well, you're family.

12:43.006 --> 12:45.299
Are you telling us
you're getting divorced?

12:45.467 --> 12:47.342
- That's what I thought too.
- No.

12:51.514 --> 12:53.057
We...

12:54.684 --> 12:56.893
We have to sell the apartment.

12:57.061 --> 12:59.395
And we found a buyer already...

12:59.563 --> 13:02.732
so pretty soon
we're gonna have to move out.

13:02.900 --> 13:05.777
Now, it won't be long
before I get another job...

13:05.944 --> 13:09.489
and it shouldn't be long
before we find another apartment...

13:09.656 --> 13:11.657
but in the meantime...

13:11.825 --> 13:16.204
It's just a transition phase.
Probably just a week or two.

13:22.001 --> 13:24.086
We need a place to stay.

13:25.296 --> 13:27.798
Wait a minute.
Did I miss something here?

13:27.965 --> 13:31.551
These last weeks
have been tough on us, Elliot.

13:31.719 --> 13:34.554
Losing the job,
looking for health insurance.

13:34.722 --> 13:36.306
- We need a breather.
- Yeah.

13:36.473 --> 13:39.141
Moving out of here
is the last thing we want to do.

13:39.309 --> 13:41.352
It's only temporary.

13:41.520 --> 13:45.231
We'll find a new place. Very soon.

13:49.986 --> 13:52.947
Uncle, I'm sorry
I was a little bit rough in there.

13:53.115 --> 13:55.282
- Let's go. Elliot.
- Think positive, Ben.

13:55.450 --> 13:56.950
Thanks for the beer.

13:59.161 --> 14:01.788
I love you guys.
I'll call you during the week.

14:06.293 --> 14:07.919
We're right here.

14:09.964 --> 14:12.423
- Good night. Bye-bye.
- Bye, Mama.

14:12.591 --> 14:15.969
I feel bad that I can't help out,
but you've seen my apartment.

14:16.137 --> 14:18.262
It's okay. They can stay with me.

14:18.429 --> 14:22.516
I had a feeling that they were hoping
to stay with one of us here in the city.

14:22.684 --> 14:26.562
- Didn't you see the look on their faces?
- What are you talking about?

14:26.729 --> 14:29.439
I'm saying
they don't want to go live upstate.

14:29.607 --> 14:32.109
Country boys all of a sudden.
I can't see that.

14:32.277 --> 14:35.487
- It's temporary.
- Honey's right.

14:35.655 --> 14:37.655
Maybe there's something
that we can do.

14:37.823 --> 14:41.534
- I thought we figured it all out already.
- Mindy.

14:41.702 --> 14:44.537
I'm the only one
with the extra bedroom.

14:44.705 --> 14:47.623
No, it's not about that, Mindy.
It's Poughkeepsie.

14:47.791 --> 14:50.459
- When were you there last?
- That doesn't matter.

14:50.627 --> 14:53.880
George has his private students here.
Ben has his galleries.

14:54.047 --> 14:55.840
They need to look
for an apartment.

14:56.008 --> 14:58.758
Doesn't make sense
to live two and a half hours away.

14:58.926 --> 15:01.386
- It's an hour and a half.
- Not by bus.

15:01.554 --> 15:03.638
- By car.
- They don't drive.

15:03.806 --> 15:05.974
They can very well learn how to.

15:06.142 --> 15:10.103
- Are you really serious, Mindy?
- Shut the fuck up, Honey.

15:10.271 --> 15:13.481
You're not even family,
so you don't get to decide anything.

15:13.649 --> 15:15.400
They're right upstairs, you guys.

15:15.568 --> 15:18.527
Since we're here, why don't we step
inside my apartment.

15:18.695 --> 15:21.363
Elliot, let's go.
I still have some work to do.

15:21.531 --> 15:24.366
- Can we just figure this out?
- It's almost 7:00.

15:24.534 --> 15:26.660
- Please.
- We'll miss supper.

17:16.682 --> 17:18.933
So why don't you tell me
how and where...

17:19.101 --> 17:22.979
we can accommodate a crowd this size
if we can't close the street at 7.

17:23.146 --> 17:24.480
Dad.

17:24.647 --> 17:27.442
No, that's because you told me
we had a permit.

17:27.608 --> 17:29.652
Dad, can we just talk for a second?

17:29.820 --> 17:31.237
James, hold on.

17:31.405 --> 17:34.032
So the geography project
that I have to do?

17:34.199 --> 17:35.490
No, help me out.

17:35.658 --> 17:37.284
- Sustainable development.
- Yes.

17:37.452 --> 17:40.454
They're painting Vlad's house,
so I told him to come here.

17:40.621 --> 17:43.165
No, 7 p.m. to 5 a.m.
That's what I requested.

17:43.333 --> 17:44.916
- Dad.
- Please, hold on.

17:45.084 --> 17:47.961
They're painting Vlad's house.
I told him to come here.

17:48.129 --> 17:50.422
Are you gonna be
in the living room all day?

17:50.590 --> 17:53.425
- Joey, this is important.
- It's quick. He's on his way.

17:53.593 --> 17:58.387
Sorry, son. James, you know two hours
can make all the difference in the world.

17:58.555 --> 17:59.805
Close the street...

17:59.973 --> 18:01.432
- Who is this?
- Vlad.

18:01.600 --> 18:03.768
He can come in.
It's my friend. Thanks.

18:08.190 --> 18:11.192
- What's up?
- I found a book on the Amazon.

18:11.360 --> 18:14.362
Some really cool pictures
of naked natives and everything.

18:14.529 --> 18:15.779
Nice.

18:17.031 --> 18:18.656
- Your dad is home?
- Yeah.

18:18.824 --> 18:21.201
- Do you not understand?
- Go to your room?

18:21.369 --> 18:24.996
- I gotta talk to my mom first, but...
- Okay.

18:26.457 --> 18:29.084
- Can I get some water?
- Yeah, sure.

18:30.503 --> 18:34.464
I'll tell you what I don't understand.
This has been on the schedule...

18:34.632 --> 18:36.340
Oh, hello.

18:36.508 --> 18:37.883
I'm Vlad.

18:38.051 --> 18:40.010
My name is Eugenia.

18:40.178 --> 18:42.388
I work for Joey's parents.

18:43.056 --> 18:45.849
- Are you Russian?
- Yes.

18:51.439 --> 18:53.148
We might go to the library.

18:54.526 --> 18:56.484
But isn't Vlad here?

18:56.652 --> 18:58.111
Yeah. I told you.

18:58.278 --> 19:00.488
So then why don't you just work here?

19:06.412 --> 19:08.913
Why? What?

19:15.002 --> 19:17.838
Well, just wake him gently, then.

19:18.005 --> 19:19.923
You do it. I'm not...

19:23.719 --> 19:25.345
Joey.

19:29.684 --> 19:31.309
Uncle Ben?

19:32.687 --> 19:35.354
Uncle Ben, I'm so sorry to wake you.

19:36.106 --> 19:39.608
Hi. Joey has something
that he needs to ask you.

19:39.776 --> 19:41.235
Mom...

19:43.363 --> 19:45.281
- Hi, Uncle Ben.
- Hey.

19:45.449 --> 19:46.782
Hi.

19:47.325 --> 19:49.910
My friend Vlad is here...

19:50.078 --> 19:53.497
and we need to work
on a school presentation...

19:53.665 --> 19:57.083
and there's nowhere else
for us to study.

19:57.251 --> 19:58.751
Who?

20:01.088 --> 20:02.839
Oh, Vlad.

20:04.091 --> 20:06.134
Good to meet you.
Heard a lot about you.

20:06.302 --> 20:08.136
Hi, Uncle Ben.

20:08.304 --> 20:12.348
Sorry, I...
I guess I'd fallen asleep.

20:12.516 --> 20:14.142
What time is it?

20:14.976 --> 20:16.768
It's 2.

20:19.939 --> 20:21.607
2:05.

20:23.818 --> 20:26.820
So what's this presentation
you're working on?

20:28.615 --> 20:31.950
This little box connects directly
to our Netflix account...

20:32.118 --> 20:33.994
our iTunes, our YouTube.

20:34.162 --> 20:36.412
Here. Hang on. Watch.
Let me show you.

20:37.956 --> 20:40.666
- Oh, have you seen this?
- No, what is that?

20:40.834 --> 20:43.002
You have never seen this?

20:43.170 --> 20:45.379
It's Game of Thrones.

20:48.008 --> 20:49.425
Oh, look.

20:50.552 --> 20:52.011
Daenerys Targaryen.

20:52.179 --> 20:54.013
I love her.

20:54.181 --> 20:55.805
She's so regal.

20:55.973 --> 20:57.974
Yeah, I can see that.

20:58.142 --> 21:00.560
She's shopping for an army
in Slaver's Bay.

21:01.854 --> 21:04.189
It's quite sexy, isn't it, the whole thing?

21:04.357 --> 21:07.275
I could do with one
of those slaves myself.

21:07.443 --> 21:09.694
Why does she need
a whole army of them?

21:09.862 --> 21:13.448
She's a princess in exile who's coming
back to the Seven Kingdoms.

21:13.616 --> 21:16.825
She needs an army.
And her brother was...

21:16.993 --> 21:21.372
No, I'm not even gonna tell you because
you are going to watch it with me.

21:21.540 --> 21:23.082
We are?

21:23.250 --> 21:24.792
Hey, guys.

21:24.960 --> 21:27.086
George, you met my friend Doreen, right?

21:27.254 --> 21:29.255
- Doreen.
- Hey.

21:33.051 --> 21:35.510
- Hi, George.
- I need your help in the kitchen.

21:35.678 --> 21:37.428
Just two minutes, babe.

21:38.847 --> 21:42.308
- How are your new daddies treating you?
- Oh, I can't complain.

21:42.476 --> 21:45.645
I've always liked this couch.
I've taken good naps here.

21:45.813 --> 21:47.188
It's a good bed too.

21:47.356 --> 21:50.483
If I drink too much,
maybe I'll sleep here with you tonight.

21:51.694 --> 21:55.028
Ours is on mixed farming,
which is when a farmer manages...

21:55.196 --> 21:57.823
a mix of different crops and animals.

21:57.991 --> 21:59.866
So why is that eco-friendly?

22:00.034 --> 22:02.244
Well, nobody says "eco-friendly" anymore.

22:02.412 --> 22:05.872
- Isn't it "eco-efficient" now?
- It's "sustainable. "

22:06.791 --> 22:08.750
Sustainable agriculture.

22:09.711 --> 22:13.630
So how is mixed farming
sustainable, then?

22:14.715 --> 22:17.800
Well, the crop residues
are used as food for the animals...

22:17.968 --> 22:22.305
and the excrements
from the animals...

22:22.472 --> 22:25.391
is used as a nutrient for the crop.

22:25.559 --> 22:28.436
Joey. Your uncle's still eating.

22:28.604 --> 22:30.271
Oh, sorry.

22:32.190 --> 22:35.525
Yeah, well, they're only just now
deciding to have dinner.

22:35.693 --> 22:38.194
No, I can't.
I've got a student in the morning.

22:38.362 --> 22:39.904
Anybody in?

22:41.073 --> 22:42.365
Hello.

22:45.202 --> 22:48.371
- Linda, hey!
- I can't believe it.

22:48.539 --> 22:50.874
Someone's just turned up
with a bloody baby.

22:51.042 --> 22:54.376
Look at me. See? See?
Doreen, Doreen.

22:54.544 --> 22:57.880
No, I went to the diner,
got some matzo ball soup.

23:00.008 --> 23:02.259
I made my beef stew tonight.

23:03.261 --> 23:06.764
Yeah, I think they did.
They ate the whole thing.

23:06.931 --> 23:09.183
But they didn't say anything.

23:10.101 --> 23:12.686
No. No, they're very nice.

23:13.355 --> 23:15.104
But sometimes...

23:16.273 --> 23:18.441
when you live with people...

23:18.609 --> 23:22.278
you know them better
than you care to, and so...

23:25.324 --> 23:27.075
I miss you too.

23:29.161 --> 23:31.579
Yeah, well, this is what...

23:31.747 --> 23:33.665
What I don't quite understand.

23:33.832 --> 23:37.542
Why is it that we're only seeing...

23:37.710 --> 23:40.879
$17,535 in profit?

23:41.047 --> 23:45.384
To start, you have to take into account
the 1 percent New York City transfer tax...

23:45.551 --> 23:48.637
the 4 percent New York State tax,
plus 6 percent to me.

23:48.805 --> 23:50.389
That's 60,000 right there.

23:50.556 --> 23:53.642
I understand that,
but according to my calculations...

23:53.809 --> 23:57.395
- ... that should still leave...
- Don't forget your co-op also has...

23:57.562 --> 24:01.148
a flip tax of 25 percent
on whatever profit you make...

24:01.316 --> 24:03.275
if you sell before five years.

24:03.443 --> 24:05.111
It is five years.

24:05.278 --> 24:07.029
I mean, it's been five years.

24:07.197 --> 24:09.740
We bought in 2007.
It's now 2013.

24:09.908 --> 24:14.911
But, Mr. Garea, you didn't actually close
until January, if you remember.

24:15.079 --> 24:18.123
So that's 2008,
and they go by the calendar year.

24:18.290 --> 24:22.711
So you would actually have to sell
in 2014 to avoid the flip tax.

24:22.878 --> 24:25.338
This is really like something out of Kafka.

24:25.506 --> 24:30.635
Look at it this way. You've lived
in a nice apartment for 20 years.

24:30.803 --> 24:35.055
Five of that... Well, nearly five of that.
As an owner.

24:35.223 --> 24:37.266
And you sold it at a profit.

24:37.434 --> 24:42.914
You're getting $17,535,

24:42.949 --> 24:45.149
which is all yours.

24:45.483 --> 24:47.234
Thank you.

24:51.197 --> 24:55.116
Did I tell you my gallerist friend
is a big fan of yours?

24:56.910 --> 24:58.786
What? Who?

24:59.413 --> 25:02.915
- A fan of mine?
- Yeah, she loves your book.

25:05.753 --> 25:07.503
I need some tea.

25:08.088 --> 25:09.756
You want some?

25:12.050 --> 25:14.634
I would love some. Thank you.

25:16.012 --> 25:17.471
You remember her, right?

25:19.015 --> 25:20.640
- Who?
- Aida.

25:20.808 --> 25:22.350
My gallerist friend.

25:22.518 --> 25:25.979
On the Lower East Side, yes.
I think that I met her.

25:26.731 --> 25:28.523
Tall blond.

25:29.692 --> 25:31.026
Swedish.

25:31.194 --> 25:33.153
Yes, I met her.

25:33.321 --> 25:36.697
Last week I stopped by the gallery
and she was reading your book.

25:36.865 --> 25:39.074
I screamed.
I absolutely screamed.

25:41.787 --> 25:44.330
She had no idea
that you were my niece.

26:01.680 --> 26:04.182
You know my favorite story of yours?

26:04.350 --> 26:07.977
The one about the old high-school friend
who shows up at the diner.

26:08.646 --> 26:10.522
She sees him...

26:13.650 --> 26:16.902
But I can't remember
why she can't be sure it's her friend.

26:19.364 --> 26:21.990
The worst part of getting old is memory.

26:22.867 --> 26:25.786
It only gets worse with time,
let me tell you.

26:28.623 --> 26:32.668
She can't see him
because he's outside and it's snowing.

26:32.836 --> 26:35.211
Oh, right, he's in the car, right?

26:36.129 --> 26:38.381
She's not really sure that it's him.

26:39.174 --> 26:41.092
Because of the blizzard.

26:41.260 --> 26:42.844
Right.

26:43.720 --> 26:48.307
So beautiful, Kate. Really.
Just wonderful writing.

26:50.644 --> 26:52.061
It's hot.

26:57.233 --> 26:59.317
Which one is your favorite?

27:01.028 --> 27:02.737
I don't have a favorite.

27:02.905 --> 27:06.491
It's like me with my painting.
I don't have a favorite either.

27:06.659 --> 27:08.368
George does.

27:08.536 --> 27:11.955
He loves those two nudes
that hang in the bedroom.

27:12.123 --> 27:14.248
That used to hang in the bedroom.

27:15.792 --> 27:18.669
- I gave those to him for his 40th.
- Fortieth. Yes.

27:18.837 --> 27:20.379
I remember. I love those too.

27:20.547 --> 27:24.216
You know, maybe you could start
a new painting soon.

27:24.384 --> 27:27.469
It's the hardest thing, Kate,
to be honest with you.

27:28.471 --> 27:30.806
I brought all my stuff here, but...

27:32.183 --> 27:33.850
- What?
- Well...

27:34.018 --> 27:37.854
it's just that I can't really work
if there's someone else around.

27:38.689 --> 27:41.190
I can't concentrate, you know?

28:06.841 --> 28:08.091
How did it go?

28:14.640 --> 28:17.600
Better than we could have ever expected.

28:17.768 --> 28:19.393
I knew it.

28:28.403 --> 28:31.280
I called you to see if you were
coming home for dinner.

28:31.448 --> 28:34.574
- You did?
- Yes. I left a message.

28:35.076 --> 28:36.826
Sorry, baby.

28:36.994 --> 28:39.663
I didn't even have a moment
to check my messages.

28:41.916 --> 28:43.667
That busy?

28:44.418 --> 28:48.213
Yeah. We got it all in the can.

28:50.299 --> 28:51.841
That's great.

28:54.636 --> 28:56.178
I'm exhausted.

29:01.226 --> 29:03.268
I wanna sleep, baby.

29:05.647 --> 29:07.106
Sleep.

29:14.363 --> 29:16.155
What is it, Kate?

29:19.576 --> 29:22.704
Unlike you,
I didn't have a very productive day.

29:26.625 --> 29:28.418
Was it Joey?

29:29.253 --> 29:30.920
Joey? No.

29:31.088 --> 29:33.296
Joey hardly said two words
to me today...

29:33.464 --> 29:36.550
but if you were around more,
you'd see that's the norm.

29:39.512 --> 29:41.013
Was it the neighbors again?

29:41.764 --> 29:45.517
No. Elliot, it's your uncle.

29:47.770 --> 29:51.773
When they're playing loud music,
it's easy to tell them to turn it down.

29:51.941 --> 29:57.820
But when it's Uncle Ben chatting away,
it's a lot harder to tell him to shut up.

30:11.001 --> 30:12.292
Mr. Garea?

30:12.460 --> 30:16.004
Yes, that's me. This is Mr. Hull.
I'd like him to come with me.

30:16.172 --> 30:18.256
Okay. Right this way.

30:20.092 --> 30:24.846
These apartments are city-sponsored
and are currently accepting applications.

30:25.014 --> 30:27.390
The tenants are selected by a lottery...

30:27.558 --> 30:31.811
but first you need to meet the criteria
for the specific development...

30:31.979 --> 30:33.937
and each one has its own.

30:34.105 --> 30:36.857
- Sorry, I only have one.
- We can share.

30:37.025 --> 30:39.485
The city itself does not rent
the apartments...

30:39.652 --> 30:42.821
so if you are selected,
this is a private transaction...

30:42.989 --> 30:45.074
between yourselves
and the developer.

30:45.241 --> 30:46.617
You understand?

30:46.785 --> 30:50.412
You need to contact the developer
or the marketing agent directly.

30:50.580 --> 30:54.290
You'll see phone numbers and other
info in this list I just gave you.

30:54.458 --> 30:56.125
I have a question.

30:56.919 --> 30:58.586
We're married.

30:58.754 --> 31:02.090
- So we'll be applying together.
- Okay.

31:04.885 --> 31:08.221
For example, this one-bedroom property
in Fort Greene-Wallabout.

31:08.388 --> 31:10.932
Five hundred and eleven dollars
monthly rental...

31:11.100 --> 31:15.894
$19,509 minimum earnings figure...

31:16.062 --> 31:19.731
maximum is 23,240.

31:19.899 --> 31:24.194
The minimum-earning figure,
would that be for both of us?

31:24.362 --> 31:26.029
Yes, both together.

31:26.906 --> 31:28.615
Good. I wasn't sure about that.

31:28.783 --> 31:31.118
Anything you find there
that's interesting...

31:31.285 --> 31:34.203
you need to check to see
that you meet the criteria.

31:34.996 --> 31:37.373
Well, that's all I have for now.

31:38.333 --> 31:40.417
Well, sounds like a good start.

31:44.965 --> 31:46.590
Thanks very much.

31:49.678 --> 31:52.220
- Sir, can I ask you a question?
- Yes.

31:52.388 --> 31:54.639
- How old are you?
- Seventy-one.

31:54.807 --> 31:56.891
You might want to try the DFTA as well.

31:57.059 --> 31:59.811
- DFTA?
- Department for the Aging.

32:00.938 --> 32:03.439
They have a whole department
just for us.

32:04.150 --> 32:05.567
Isn't that encouraging.

32:05.734 --> 32:09.279
They keep a list of affordable housing
for senior citizens.

32:09.446 --> 32:12.364
There's usually a waiting list,
but it's worth a try.

32:12.532 --> 32:13.991
Oh, thank you.

32:14.534 --> 32:16.118
Thanks very much.

32:45.689 --> 32:47.899
What the fuck, Vlad?

32:48.066 --> 32:50.902
I'm posing for your uncle's
new masterpiece.

32:52.570 --> 32:54.237
That's so gay.

32:55.281 --> 32:59.451
People have been modeling for painters
for centuries now, Joe.

32:59.619 --> 33:00.911
All kinds of people.

33:01.078 --> 33:03.121
He doesn't mean "homosexual,"
Uncle Ben.

33:03.289 --> 33:05.707
- He just means "stupid. "
- Don't worry, Vlad.

33:05.875 --> 33:07.667
Joey and I understand each other.

33:07.835 --> 33:09.920
You're not even a good artist anyway.

33:11.588 --> 33:14.048
- Joey.
- What?

33:15.050 --> 33:16.467
I know you don't mean that.

33:16.635 --> 33:18.344
Yeah, I do.

33:18.511 --> 33:23.057
If you were, you wouldn't be sleeping
on a bunk bed in your nephew's house.

33:29.940 --> 33:31.315
Did you find him?

33:31.482 --> 33:34.400
He's on the fucking rooftop
with Uncle Ben.

33:34.568 --> 33:36.945
- Watch the language.
- I'm going out.

33:37.696 --> 33:39.405
And Vlad?

33:40.449 --> 33:43.493
Uncle Ben is making him pose
for a painting.

33:43.661 --> 33:45.703
- He's what?
- You heard me.

33:45.871 --> 33:49.207
Joey, it was my idea for Ben
to take the painting to the roof...

33:49.375 --> 33:51.833
- ... because I needed to work here.
- I gotta go.

34:01.886 --> 34:04.680
- You okay there?
- Yeah, we're good.

34:17.192 --> 34:18.442
Vlad.

34:21.362 --> 34:22.989
What were you doing up there?

34:23.156 --> 34:25.866
I was helping Uncle Ben
with his painting.

34:27.119 --> 34:29.495
Aren't you supposed
to be studying biology?

34:29.663 --> 34:32.664
It's gonna be about this book
on seasons and migrations...

34:32.831 --> 34:35.250
and I know the book pretty well.

34:35.418 --> 34:37.960
If you flunk that test
and your mother calls...

34:38.129 --> 34:41.339
I'm going to tell her
that you're studying or playing?

34:41.507 --> 34:46.177
I don't flunk.
Uncle Ben, where should I leave this?

34:46.762 --> 34:49.054
Put it on the table.
I'll take care of it.

34:49.223 --> 34:51.556
When you're here,
you're my responsibility...

34:51.725 --> 34:55.561
so if you're supposed to be studying,
then you should be doing that...

34:55.728 --> 34:58.731
and not posing on the roof.

34:58.898 --> 35:02.484
- Where is Joey?
- He went to the library.

35:02.652 --> 35:04.778
- I'll go meet him there.
- Good idea.

35:04.946 --> 35:07.489
- Do you want to take anything?
- No, it's okay.

35:07.657 --> 35:10.159
- An apple? No?
- Thank you, Mrs. Kate.

35:11.660 --> 35:13.286
I'll see you later, Uncle Ben.

35:13.454 --> 35:15.830
- Goodbye, Vlad.
- Goodbye.

35:17.041 --> 35:18.833
Bye, Vlad.

35:22.171 --> 35:24.380
Joey got very upset.

35:25.007 --> 35:27.925
He called Vlad gay...

35:28.093 --> 35:30.553
in quite an offensive fashion.

35:31.346 --> 35:35.599
Kids have expanded the meaning of gay
beyond sexual orientation, so...

35:35.767 --> 35:38.518
- ... don't get offended.
- I didn't.

35:39.395 --> 35:42.189
I guess it just means "stupid" now.

35:44.400 --> 35:48.987
Yes, yes, I think
that you are right about that.

35:49.530 --> 35:53.240
I don't know if Joey felt left out or...

35:54.326 --> 35:57.328
I don't know what in the world
was going through his mind.

35:57.496 --> 35:59.663
Well, you know...

36:01.333 --> 36:04.502
he's a teenager and...

36:06.088 --> 36:10.633
is it really appropriate
to be using Joey's friend as a model?

36:20.226 --> 36:21.601
Mindy, it's Kate.

36:21.769 --> 36:24.437
Hi, Kate. How are you doing?

36:24.605 --> 36:26.398
I'm okay.

36:26.565 --> 36:27.816
How's Joey?

36:27.983 --> 36:30.443
Oh, he's fine. How are you?

36:30.611 --> 36:32.945
Everything's great.
Amazing, actually.

36:33.113 --> 36:36.824
Yes. I went to see
this chromotherapist up in Kingston.

36:36.991 --> 36:38.450
What?

36:39.452 --> 36:40.911
Chromotherapy.

36:41.079 --> 36:42.996
- You're kidding.
- No.

36:43.164 --> 36:45.124
The guy talks to you
for 15 minutes...

36:45.291 --> 36:48.043
and then floats his hand
over your body to feel...

36:48.211 --> 36:50.670
energy you're missing: physical...

36:50.838 --> 36:52.171
emotional, spiritual.

36:52.339 --> 36:54.924
Hard to explain,
but he feels the energy levels...

36:55.092 --> 36:58.344
and then prescribes colored lights
to restore your balance.

36:58.512 --> 37:02.140
I was just taking a nap
under a greenish light he gave me.

37:02.724 --> 37:06.853
You wouldn't believe it,
but I feel like I am a different person.

37:07.020 --> 37:09.522
That's great. Good for you.

37:09.690 --> 37:12.274
I am trying to work
with a house full of people...

37:12.442 --> 37:16.319
- ... and, believe me, it hasn't been easy.
- Kate, I said I would take them.

37:16.487 --> 37:19.990
I just wanted to be sure if...

37:22.410 --> 37:25.745
In case they don't find a place.

37:26.497 --> 37:27.914
It's so sad.

37:28.082 --> 37:30.041
I really feel terrible about it.

37:30.209 --> 37:34.086
The problem is Elliot
is never around, so...

37:34.254 --> 37:37.923
I wind up having to take care
of all of his problems.

37:39.217 --> 37:40.718
Yes?

37:41.386 --> 37:44.346
Hold on a second, Min. Hi, Ben.

37:45.265 --> 37:46.891
I didn't want to interrupt.

37:47.058 --> 37:48.601
No.

37:48.768 --> 37:51.769
I wanted to talk to you about earlier.

37:51.937 --> 37:54.189
- It's not... No, it's fine.
- You sure?

37:54.356 --> 37:55.982
Yes.

37:56.150 --> 37:58.067
I'm talking to Mindy.

37:59.612 --> 38:02.530
She wants to know
when you'll visit her in Poughkeepsie.

38:05.534 --> 38:07.494
Well, send her my love.

38:08.245 --> 38:10.079
We can talk tomorrow.

38:34.228 --> 38:36.145
Wait. Where am I flying?

38:38.732 --> 38:41.067
Explain the plot to him, okay?

38:41.235 --> 38:44.153
- You're in a big spherical room.
- Yeah.

38:44.321 --> 38:46.239
There's a big opening at the top.

38:46.406 --> 38:48.366
You're just gonna go:

38:48.534 --> 38:50.242
And see what's up there.

38:50.409 --> 38:52.202
- All right.
- Are you into that?

38:52.370 --> 38:53.787
- Plus 18?
- Yeah.

38:53.955 --> 38:55.372
You can't have plus 18.

38:55.540 --> 38:57.541
- No fucking way.
- Why you cheating?

38:57.708 --> 39:00.919
No, I'm sorry.
It's down here. It's down here.

39:03.589 --> 39:06.758
If there's a fiery pit,
that's the first thing we'll look at.

39:07.635 --> 39:10.219
Where you are perpendicular,
there are two doors.

39:10.387 --> 39:11.637
Are there exits?

39:11.805 --> 39:14.056
- I will describe it to you.
- Okay.

39:14.224 --> 39:18.102
As your eyes begin to get used to...

39:18.270 --> 39:21.188
What's that word?
Get used to...

39:21.356 --> 39:24.733
- Luminosity.
- No, but, like, when you go outside and...

39:25.443 --> 39:28.988
No, and you get used to...
You acclimate or... Yeah, yeah.

39:29.155 --> 39:32.407
So you start to acclimate.
Actually, you can start to see.

39:32.575 --> 39:37.370
And what you see
is this ginormous tree.

39:37.538 --> 39:40.081
- Underground?
- Yes.

39:40.249 --> 39:43.710
You've never seen an underground tree?
Well, you're about to.

39:43.877 --> 39:45.628
Okay, so this tree comes up...

39:45.796 --> 39:50.048
and out from behind this tree
is this giant clown.

39:51.551 --> 39:54.261
- Tree clown.
- This is where it gets freakish.

39:54.429 --> 39:56.096
- Yeah.
- No, I like it.

39:56.264 --> 39:58.932
You do not want to go out there.
It's coming down.

39:59.100 --> 40:00.767
I'll be fine.

40:03.396 --> 40:05.397
Is he old enough to enjoy the Louvre?

40:05.565 --> 40:08.108
He's obsessed
with the French Revolution.

40:08.276 --> 40:12.236
I know, but you don't have to go
to Paris to learn about the guillotine.

40:12.404 --> 40:17.241
There's a group of eight, and they need
two more in order to get the discount.

40:18.118 --> 40:19.827
Is Vlad going?

40:20.454 --> 40:22.663
- Yes.
- Of course.

40:22.831 --> 40:24.624
Of course.

40:26.126 --> 40:28.044
How much is it gonna cost?

40:28.211 --> 40:30.337
It's 1800.

40:30.504 --> 40:32.088
Hotel included.

40:32.256 --> 40:33.840
Oh, damn.

40:36.135 --> 40:38.219
- Speak of the devil.
- Who is that?

40:38.387 --> 40:40.847
Well, it's 10:00. It must be Vlad.

40:42.350 --> 40:44.893
- Who is it?
- George.

41:19.968 --> 41:21.219
I'm sorry.

41:25.724 --> 41:28.017
- Sorry.
- Don't be silly.

41:28.644 --> 41:30.310
Now stop this.

41:58.380 --> 42:00.631
Why can't he sleep on the couch?

42:01.591 --> 42:03.217
Because, Joey...

42:04.636 --> 42:06.220
Please, son.

42:52.139 --> 42:55.433
I talked to the principal there
at PS-216.

42:56.226 --> 42:57.685
Very nice, smart guy.

42:58.729 --> 43:01.731
I think he really wants
to bring back the music program.

43:02.441 --> 43:05.943
- Do they have the budget for it?
- Well, not right now.

43:06.653 --> 43:08.821
But he seems capable
of raising the money.

43:08.988 --> 43:11.364
He's got a very nice,
attractive personality.

43:11.532 --> 43:14.576
That doesn't really help us
that much right now, does it?

43:14.744 --> 43:17.078
Well, let me finish.
You never let me finish.

43:17.246 --> 43:19.414
No job for you.
Isn't that the end of it?

43:19.582 --> 43:22.709
No, it's...
You're such a pessimist.

43:22.877 --> 43:25.045
I'm just being realistic.

43:25.213 --> 43:26.880
Can I finish?

43:27.048 --> 43:29.590
- Okay, go ahead.
- Thank you.

43:30.509 --> 43:32.885
Anyway, they got lots
of different kids there.

43:33.053 --> 43:36.972
White kids, black kids, Latinos.
A few Asian kids.

43:37.808 --> 43:40.476
There was this really cute little girl.

43:40.644 --> 43:42.728
I think she's from the Philippines.

43:42.896 --> 43:45.564
She played "Frere Jacques" for me
on her flute.

43:45.732 --> 43:49.609
George, why don't you come down here
where I can hear you better?

43:49.777 --> 43:51.277
It's a bunk bed.

43:51.445 --> 43:52.779
So?

43:53.864 --> 43:56.366
You told me Joey's losing
his patience with you.

43:56.534 --> 43:59.911
Can you imagine if you broke his bed
trying to shag your husband?

44:01.622 --> 44:04.749
I have missed having your body
next to mine...

44:04.917 --> 44:09.002
too much to have it denied to me
for reasons of bad engineering.

44:18.721 --> 44:23.183
Well, don't blame me
if this whole thing falls apart.

44:34.653 --> 44:36.279
Come in here.

45:04.223 --> 45:05.849
Ben...

45:09.853 --> 45:12.146
do you ever blame me for all of this?

45:13.148 --> 45:14.815
Why would I?

45:15.775 --> 45:17.818
We did this together.

45:22.282 --> 45:24.491
But I knew what might happen.

45:26.703 --> 45:29.412
I knew more than you
what we were risking.

45:32.333 --> 45:37.629
All I know is that after 39 years,
it's hard to fall asleep without you.

45:39.173 --> 45:41.299
This situation we've got ourselves in...

45:41.467 --> 45:44.719
is really fucking
with my sleeping patterns.

46:41.857 --> 46:43.400
What happened?

46:44.360 --> 46:47.988
I mean, what was that? That's not
what we talked about last week.

46:48.154 --> 46:50.322
Interpretation.

46:50.490 --> 46:55.035
Yes, well, I usually insist that you let
the music take you somewhere.

46:55.203 --> 46:57.371
Let it surprise you.

46:57.539 --> 46:59.707
Even, on occasion, let it overwhelm you.

46:59.874 --> 47:03.168
It's important as knowing the difference
between a half step...

47:03.336 --> 47:06.255
and a semi-tone, but always,
always you must focus...

47:06.423 --> 47:08.756
on the instrument you're playing.

47:08.924 --> 47:11.801
And listen. Always listen.

47:11.969 --> 47:14.178
Listen to what
the metronome's telling you.

47:16.557 --> 47:18.933
Tick tock, tick tock.

47:19.101 --> 47:22.353
Follow the rhythm. Follow the rhythm.

47:23.022 --> 47:26.107
You can't just create
your own rhythm to Chopin.

47:28.484 --> 47:30.318
All right, do it again.

48:51.355 --> 48:53.064
Dear parents:

48:54.108 --> 48:58.236
By now you've all heard
of my joyful news and of my sad news.

48:58.946 --> 49:01.239
To be able to finally marry
Benjamin Hull...

49:01.406 --> 49:05.660
my partner of almost 40 years,
in a small ceremony here in New York...

49:05.828 --> 49:08.620
was one of the happiest moments
of my life.

49:09.956 --> 49:13.458
Unfortunately, later I found out
that I could no longer continue...

49:13.626 --> 49:15.836
to teach music at St. Grace's.

49:19.590 --> 49:22.634
Everyone at the school knew
that I was gay...

49:22.802 --> 49:25.846
and that Ben was my lifelong partner.

49:26.013 --> 49:29.140
I've always had nothing but support
from all of you...

49:29.307 --> 49:32.059
so I would like to thank you
and to emphasize...

49:32.227 --> 49:36.313
that what happened is not the fault
of St. Grace's and its leadership.

49:38.900 --> 49:43.737
Above all, I urge you to have
a conversation with your children...

49:43.905 --> 49:47.032
about whether or not
justice was served here.

49:47.950 --> 49:50.410
The last thing I want them
to take from this...

49:50.578 --> 49:53.580
is they should hide who they are
or what they think...

49:53.747 --> 49:56.374
if they believe
it will get them into trouble.

50:06.093 --> 50:09.178
Life has its obstacles,
but I learned early on...

50:09.345 --> 50:12.973
that they will always be lessened
if faced with honesty.

50:13.558 --> 50:17.728
I believe the world is a better place
if people aren't lying.

50:17.896 --> 50:20.856
In the words of the apostle Paul
to the Corinthians:

50:21.024 --> 50:23.817
"Love does not delight in injustice...

50:23.985 --> 50:26.361
but rejoices with the truth. "

50:27.113 --> 50:30.239
Yours sincerely, George Garea.

50:35.954 --> 50:40.333
Very good.

50:50.134 --> 50:52.969
I don't have time to read it.
I want to.

50:53.137 --> 50:54.888
But you don't.

51:00.019 --> 51:03.730
Hey! Can I have some private time,
please?

51:14.866 --> 51:17.868
It didn't make a big difference.

51:19.496 --> 51:22.498
I'm sorry. I don't want to intrude.

51:23.917 --> 51:28.169
No. Why don't you grab a glass
and join us for some wine.

51:28.963 --> 51:30.296
Thanks.

51:32.633 --> 51:35.510
- How was your day?
- Nice.

51:37.638 --> 51:40.223
Yeah, George went to church...

51:40.391 --> 51:43.017
and I went to see a wonderful movie.

51:43.185 --> 51:44.602
What did you see?

51:44.770 --> 51:46.771
The Gang's All Here.

51:46.938 --> 51:50.232
- You did not. How could I forget?
- You remember that?

51:56.948 --> 52:00.033
- What is that?
- A Busby Berkeley musical.

52:00.201 --> 52:02.995
They have this wonderful new print...

52:03.162 --> 52:06.706
and I have to say, Elliot,
I was so happy...

52:06.873 --> 52:11.043
when they came out with VHS
and we could see old movies again.

52:11.211 --> 52:13.879
And I'm glad I showed them all to you.

52:14.047 --> 52:15.339
But...

52:15.507 --> 52:19.093
But this, seeing it up on the big screen,
it's something else.

52:19.261 --> 52:21.220
It's not even the same movie.

52:21.388 --> 52:23.931
- I'd love to see that.
- Let's go tomorrow?

52:24.099 --> 52:26.058
Yes.

52:26.226 --> 52:29.269
No. Shit. I can't tomorrow.

52:30.021 --> 52:31.896
I'll go on my own.

52:39.030 --> 52:41.114
Joey asleep?

52:41.282 --> 52:44.951
I think he and Vlad are still studying.

52:45.119 --> 52:46.827
Vlad?

52:46.995 --> 52:48.787
What's Vlad doing here?

52:48.955 --> 52:50.622
Not studying.

52:52.709 --> 52:54.668
Well, I think I'll take a look.

52:54.836 --> 52:56.545
Don't go.

52:58.214 --> 52:59.465
Why not?

52:59.632 --> 53:04.803
Last year, you two were complaining
that Joey didn't have any friends.

53:05.847 --> 53:08.848
You were so worried
that he was too antisocial...

53:09.016 --> 53:11.559
you even sent him to see a therapist.

53:11.727 --> 53:14.771
- So?
- So now he has a friend.

53:16.148 --> 53:17.899
Well, it's a little strange.

53:18.067 --> 53:19.984
There's nothing strange.

53:21.278 --> 53:25.281
It's his only friend,
and the guy's a lot older than him.

53:25.449 --> 53:27.157
He's 16.

53:27.325 --> 53:29.242
He just looks older.

53:30.411 --> 53:32.996
They're like Yogi Bear and Boo Boo.

53:44.050 --> 53:45.884
Good night, Mr. Hull.

54:06.320 --> 54:07.821
Joey?

54:09.865 --> 54:11.533
Yeah?

54:11.700 --> 54:13.243
You awake?

54:19.667 --> 54:21.668
Could I ask you a question?

54:26.714 --> 54:28.215
Yeah.

54:28.383 --> 54:30.384
Have you ever been in love?

54:33.805 --> 54:35.472
I'm not gay.

54:35.640 --> 54:37.057
No.

54:37.225 --> 54:39.810
I didn't mean to imply that, Joey.

54:42.772 --> 54:46.399
- So, what do you mean?
- Love. You know what love is.

54:52.739 --> 54:55.741
Well, there was this girl once.

54:56.577 --> 55:00.288
We were on vacation in Saint Croix.
It's in the Virgin islands.

55:00.456 --> 55:03.040
Yeah, I remember
when you guys went there.

55:05.043 --> 55:08.378
There was another family who...

55:08.546 --> 55:12.424
They were renting a house
on the same beach as us.

55:12.592 --> 55:14.134
And they had a daughter.

55:15.344 --> 55:19.014
And every morning,
I would watch her go windsurfing.

55:19.182 --> 55:21.183
Did you go windsurfing too?

55:21.350 --> 55:24.686
No. We had Jet Skis.

55:25.813 --> 55:29.148
But I'd watch her from the beach.

55:30.108 --> 55:33.652
So one day I saw her watching me too.

55:33.820 --> 55:36.614
- On the Jet Skis.
- Yeah.

55:36.781 --> 55:39.408
Yeah, I saw her looking at me.

55:39.576 --> 55:41.410
Do you know her name?

55:41.578 --> 55:43.329
No.

55:43.497 --> 55:45.456
We never even said hello.

55:49.418 --> 55:51.961
I think I might see her again though...

55:52.129 --> 55:54.672
because her family,
they live in the city too.

55:55.508 --> 55:57.967
If you do, will you say hello?

56:03.933 --> 56:05.683
I don't know.

56:13.316 --> 56:15.317
I think you should.

59:11.443 --> 59:13.653
The shoulder is a ball-and-socket joint.

59:13.821 --> 59:17.198
The ball of the arm fits
into the socket at the shoulder blade...

59:17.366 --> 59:19.659
and it's kept there by the rotator cuff.

59:19.827 --> 59:23.162
He had what we call a full thickness tear
or a complete tear.

59:23.330 --> 59:25.163
- Can he paint?
- No.

59:25.331 --> 59:28.041
I don't even want him
to comb his hair for a while.

59:28.209 --> 59:29.960
Poor Ben.

59:30.128 --> 59:33.714
- His legs are okay?
- Yeah, legs are fine.

59:33.881 --> 59:37.509
It was so hard to get him to stand up.
I thought his leg was broken.

59:37.677 --> 59:39.136
He was in a lot of pain.

59:39.303 --> 59:42.180
When was the last time
he had a full cardiac checkup?

59:42.348 --> 59:44.266
We have regular checkups every year.

59:44.434 --> 59:46.684
You need to have him see a cardiologist.

59:46.852 --> 59:49.203
I thought he'd just
fallen down the stairs.

59:49.229 --> 59:50.296
No, he fainted.

59:51.022 --> 59:53.357
Anyway, I don't want to speculate here.

59:53.525 --> 59:55.943
I am an orthopedist.
I'm not a cardiologist.

59:57.612 --> 59:59.113
All right?

01:00:01.908 --> 01:00:03.576
Here.

01:00:03.744 --> 01:00:07.078
You should take these now.

01:00:07.705 --> 01:00:09.456
Oh, thank you.

01:00:16.005 --> 01:00:17.964
I have to leave...

01:00:18.841 --> 01:00:22.469
but there's a plate of pasta for you
in the microwave.

01:00:23.471 --> 01:00:25.220
Thank you, Kate.

01:00:27.724 --> 01:00:29.933
Are you sure you're going to be all right?

01:00:30.101 --> 01:00:33.061
- I'll be fine.
- Okay, then.

01:00:48.118 --> 01:00:49.994
I don't want you to worry too much.

01:00:50.162 --> 01:00:54.373
It's not a very big deal. We deal
with similar problems every day here.

01:00:54.541 --> 01:00:57.126
But it is serious.

01:00:57.294 --> 01:00:59.796
No, I'm just shocked.

01:00:59.963 --> 01:01:03.424
Joey's such a serious kid,
and he's such a good student.

01:01:03.592 --> 01:01:05.342
And so is Vlad.

01:01:05.510 --> 01:01:08.345
Have you noticed
any new books in the house?

01:01:08.513 --> 01:01:10.180
I haven't been paying attention.

01:01:10.348 --> 01:01:12.724
I'm trying to finish my own new book...

01:01:12.892 --> 01:01:15.227
and Elliot's Uncle Ben
is staying with us.

01:01:15.394 --> 01:01:18.647
He's sleeping in Joey's room,
so it's a bit of a...

01:01:18.815 --> 01:01:20.816
Yeah, complicated situation.

01:01:20.983 --> 01:01:25.444
Vlad has confessed that he took
the books out and gave them to Joey...

01:01:25.612 --> 01:01:27.488
but your son denies having them.

01:01:27.656 --> 01:01:30.533
Vlad seems to have a great influence
over my son.

01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:33.494
I don't understand
why they would steal these books.

01:01:33.662 --> 01:01:35.663
They're all French literature books.

01:01:36.331 --> 01:01:38.457
I have no idea.

01:01:39.376 --> 01:01:41.544
- George.
- Are you all right?

01:01:41.711 --> 01:01:43.963
No, no, no, I'm fine.

01:01:44.130 --> 01:01:46.881
But after the operation...

01:01:47.049 --> 01:01:50.009
I think it's better
if I go stay with Mindy.

01:01:50.177 --> 01:01:53.805
- But then when will I see you?
- You'll come on the weekends.

01:02:05.692 --> 01:02:07.734
Ben, are you there?

01:02:08.444 --> 01:02:11.572
You're not a boy anymore, son.
You're a young man.

01:02:11.739 --> 01:02:15.742
Do you know how lucky you are
this happened to you in high school?

01:02:15.910 --> 01:02:18.475
Because in the real
world, you're in jail.

01:02:18.501 --> 01:02:20.230
I didn't steal anything.

01:02:22.625 --> 01:02:26.627
- Hello?
- Ben, would you like some more water?

01:02:26.795 --> 01:02:29.881
- Yes, please.
- No, let's leave it the way it is.

01:02:30.048 --> 01:02:32.049
I don't want to change anything now.

01:02:32.217 --> 01:02:34.427
Can we do this later, please?

01:02:35.304 --> 01:02:39.056
Yeah, I can't talk right now.
I'll call you back in half an hour.

01:02:41.685 --> 01:02:44.060
Thank you. Thank you.

01:02:48.399 --> 01:02:50.191
Where were we?

01:02:50.359 --> 01:02:52.027
Jail.

01:02:53.279 --> 01:02:56.948
All right, look. There has
to be consequences with this here, so...

01:02:58.784 --> 01:03:02.329
you know that trip to Paris
you wanted to go on so bad this fall?

01:03:02.496 --> 01:03:05.956
- You can forget about that.
- No, I didn't steal anything!

01:03:06.124 --> 01:03:08.876
The principal's lying
and you didn't steal the books.

01:03:09.044 --> 01:03:12.880
If that's true, you can let this be
for other times I didn't catch you.

01:03:13.048 --> 01:03:15.174
- Elliot.
- What?

01:03:15.342 --> 01:03:18.177
- Something else you want to tell me?
- What do you mean?

01:03:18.345 --> 01:03:20.554
If there's something else
going on, Joey...

01:03:20.722 --> 01:03:24.641
I would rather hear it from you now
than later from someone else.

01:03:24.808 --> 01:03:28.061
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- When kids steal...

01:03:28.228 --> 01:03:30.396
there's often drugs involved.

01:03:30.564 --> 01:03:32.523
No.

01:03:32.691 --> 01:03:35.944
- Is Vlad involved with drugs?
- Dad, no.

01:03:37.071 --> 01:03:38.947
- Can I help you, Ben?
- No, I'm fine.

01:03:39.114 --> 01:03:42.492
It's just a bit challenging
maneuvering the silverware...

01:03:42.660 --> 01:03:44.660
but I'm fine.

01:03:44.827 --> 01:03:47.371
You don't sound very sure, Joey. Is he?

01:03:47.538 --> 01:03:50.499
- Not that I know of.
- Not that you know of?

01:03:50.667 --> 01:03:53.335
You spend every minute together.
And you know what?

01:03:53.503 --> 01:03:56.129
The only way my mind
can understand how a boy...

01:03:56.297 --> 01:04:00.467
like Vlad is stealing books
in the French language is if he was high.

01:04:00.635 --> 01:04:03.387
Okay, I'm done.
Can I get up, please?

01:04:03.554 --> 01:04:08.557
- Answer me, son.
- I don't know! I'm not Vlad!

01:04:08.725 --> 01:04:11.560
Can I go to my room, please?
I still have work to do.

01:04:11.728 --> 01:04:13.354
Actually, we're still eating.

01:04:13.522 --> 01:04:15.022
It's okay. I'm almost done.

01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:17.358
- I'm sorry.
- Yes.

01:04:24.281 --> 01:04:25.907
Unbelievable.

01:04:29.036 --> 01:04:31.121
You're too nice to him.

01:04:35.876 --> 01:04:37.460
You don't even know.

01:04:47.595 --> 01:04:49.805
I know where the books are.

01:04:54.269 --> 01:04:56.687
I said, I know where the books are.

01:05:00.525 --> 01:05:02.526
I've been in the house by myself.

01:05:02.694 --> 01:05:04.694
I was looking
for something to read...

01:05:04.862 --> 01:05:08.114
and I found these old books
under my bed.

01:05:08.282 --> 01:05:11.868
- Ben, why didn't you say something?
- They were just books.

01:05:12.036 --> 01:05:13.578
Are those the books?

01:05:13.746 --> 01:05:16.956
The one I picked out
was Cyrano de Bergerac.

01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:21.502
My French is a little rusty,
but I got most of it.

01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:24.838
- I know the play...
- Frankly, who cares, Ben?

01:05:25.006 --> 01:05:27.841
- Those are the books.
- You listened the whole time.

01:05:28.009 --> 01:05:30.761
- You should've said something.
- Kate, he didn't know.

01:05:34.098 --> 01:05:37.559
- You think I'm too nice to Joey?
- Please.

01:05:37.727 --> 01:05:41.313
Let me tell you, Elliot.
You are too nice to your uncle.

01:05:41.481 --> 01:05:44.106
It's very easy being nice...

01:05:44.274 --> 01:05:48.986
when you are not the one
who's around all day.

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:58.329
Your uncle told us that the books
are in here. So where are they?

01:05:58.497 --> 01:06:01.332
Joey, I wanna know
where those books are right now.

01:06:02.334 --> 01:06:03.583
Why did you do this?

01:06:03.751 --> 01:06:06.336
We're the only ones
in that whole stupid school...

01:06:06.504 --> 01:06:09.714
- ... that'll learn French!
- It's arrogant!

01:06:33.988 --> 01:06:37.157
You're the one who was working.
I didn't want to get into it.

01:06:37.325 --> 01:06:39.451
You're the one
who's gotten into it.

01:06:42.247 --> 01:06:43.788
Bullshit.

01:07:20.825 --> 01:07:24.243
- Do you want a beer?
- No. No, thank you.

01:07:25.745 --> 01:07:28.622
I got one for my friend,
and now I can't find him.

01:07:28.790 --> 01:07:30.833
I think he left.

01:07:31.543 --> 01:07:32.960
We had an argument.

01:07:33.128 --> 01:07:36.422
- I'm Ian, by the way.
- George.

01:07:36.590 --> 01:07:38.507
I'm a friend of Roberto's.

01:07:38.675 --> 01:07:42.094
- Who's Roberto?
- Well, this is his party, I think.

01:07:42.262 --> 01:07:43.595
Oh, right.

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:46.931
I don't know anybody here.

01:07:47.099 --> 01:07:50.518
Well, that's Roberto over there.
He's the one dancing.

01:07:50.686 --> 01:07:52.979
And the tall, cute one
serving the drinks...

01:07:53.147 --> 01:07:55.899
that's Ted, his boyfriend.

01:07:56.066 --> 01:07:59.194
They're both cops.
Can you believe that?

01:07:59.361 --> 01:08:02.530
- Really? Gay cops.
- Yeah, we call them the policewomen.

01:08:03.364 --> 01:08:07.242
No, it's terrible, really.
But actually, they're very, very nice guys.

01:08:08.411 --> 01:08:09.703
So where are you from?

01:08:09.871 --> 01:08:12.247
Corsham originally. Sussex.

01:08:12.415 --> 01:08:14.416
I'm a South London boy.

01:08:14.584 --> 01:08:16.710
I came here when I was very young.

01:08:17.795 --> 01:08:21.798
On my way to dinner, my friend said,
"Let's stop by this party first. "

01:08:21.966 --> 01:08:24.091
And I said, "Sure,"
and now he's gone...

01:08:24.259 --> 01:08:27.220
and, well, here I am.

01:08:27.386 --> 01:08:29.305
You must be hungry.

01:08:29.473 --> 01:08:32.975
You were going out to dinner,
then you came here and now he's gone.

01:08:33.143 --> 01:08:35.560
- You must be hungry.
- I'm starving. You?

01:08:37.022 --> 01:08:38.814
Should we go eat?

01:08:38.982 --> 01:08:41.067
- Right now?
- Yeah.

01:08:41.234 --> 01:08:43.568
I don't have to stay here. Do you?

01:08:43.736 --> 01:08:45.612
Well, I...

01:08:46.948 --> 01:08:49.698
I'm sorry. You don't even know me.

01:08:49.867 --> 01:08:52.243
It's just that I hate to eat alone.
Don't you?

01:08:52.411 --> 01:08:56.831
Well, no. On the contrary,
I'm never bored with my own company.

01:08:56.999 --> 01:09:00.460
It's other people
who drive me crazy sometimes.

01:09:00.627 --> 01:09:03.002
Oh, no, no, don't get me wrong.
I love people.

01:09:03.171 --> 01:09:05.381
It's just I'm not very good with crowds.

01:09:05.548 --> 01:09:09.218
I'd rather meet people one on one
than stand around...

01:09:09.386 --> 01:09:12.095
with a glass of wine
and a silly grin on my face.

01:09:12.264 --> 01:09:14.014
I know what you mean.

01:09:16.017 --> 01:09:18.602
Are you waiting
for someone in particular?

01:09:18.770 --> 01:09:22.604
Well, it's not that kind
of romantic situation.

01:09:23.189 --> 01:09:25.149
So, what are you waiting for?

01:09:27.152 --> 01:09:29.654
I'm waiting for the orchestra
to stop playing...

01:09:29.822 --> 01:09:31.781
and for the curtain to fall.

01:09:33.408 --> 01:09:36.160
- Are you high?
- No.

01:09:36.328 --> 01:09:40.665
No, actually, before I started talking
to you, I was about to fall asleep.

01:09:40.832 --> 01:09:43.332
This is not the best place to sleep.

01:09:43.501 --> 01:09:45.919
And yet you're sitting on my bed.

01:09:48.214 --> 01:09:49.840
You're homeless?

01:09:51.426 --> 01:09:52.884
Yes.

01:09:56.472 --> 01:09:57.806
It's a long story.

01:09:59.851 --> 01:10:03.978
It starts with me marrying
my partner of 39 years...

01:10:04.146 --> 01:10:05.730
and then...

01:10:06.523 --> 01:10:09.734
getting fired from my job,
and now...

01:10:10.944 --> 01:10:14.488
looking for an apartment
that we can afford.

01:10:15.991 --> 01:10:18.117
I won't bore you with all the details.

01:10:19.328 --> 01:10:21.412
Well, I happen to have in my pocket...

01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:24.956
the key to a rent-controlled apartment
in the West Village...

01:10:25.124 --> 01:10:27.250
soon to be vacated.

01:10:30.588 --> 01:10:32.339
It's a long story.

01:10:34.675 --> 01:10:36.301
Shall we go eat?

01:10:37.636 --> 01:10:40.263
My uncle moved in here in the '70s.

01:10:40.431 --> 01:10:44.850
So after he went back to England,
I got the lease from him.

01:10:47.604 --> 01:10:50.105
That was about eight years ago.

01:10:50.273 --> 01:10:52.649
I've been very happy here.
I love this place.

01:10:52.817 --> 01:10:55.652
- So why are you moving?
- Because of work.

01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:57.071
I got offered a job...

01:10:57.238 --> 01:10:59.573
at the Anthropology Museum
in Mexico City.

01:10:59.741 --> 01:11:02.617
- Oh, that's an amazing place. Yeah.
- You've been there?

01:11:02.785 --> 01:11:07.413
So you know it doesn't get much better
than that for an archeologist.

01:11:08.207 --> 01:11:10.166
Would you like something to drink?

01:11:10.334 --> 01:11:12.710
Some water. Thank you.

01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:18.174
Is that the guy?

01:11:19.009 --> 01:11:21.219
Yeah. John.

01:11:22.678 --> 01:11:24.846
We've been going out for about a year.

01:11:25.014 --> 01:11:27.808
I told him about Mexico tonight
and he wasn't happy.

01:11:27.975 --> 01:11:29.810
You're a heartbreaker.

01:11:29.977 --> 01:11:32.145
On the contrary.

01:11:32.313 --> 01:11:34.064
When I first met him...

01:11:34.232 --> 01:11:37.776
I was so in love,
I didn't want to leave his side.

01:11:37.944 --> 01:11:40.904
So I think I scared him off a little.

01:11:41.072 --> 01:11:43.280
He never wanted to commit, really.

01:11:43.448 --> 01:11:45.658
Kept pushing me away.

01:11:45.826 --> 01:11:49.120
It's no coincidence that I interviewed
for this job in Mexico.

01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:54.959
Now he finds out that I'm leaving and
decides that I'm the man of his dreams.

01:11:56.128 --> 01:12:00.256
It's so typical
and so disappointing, frankly.

01:12:02.883 --> 01:12:05.927
- Do you know how much I pay here?
- No idea.

01:12:06.095 --> 01:12:07.887
I'm even embarrassed to say.

01:12:08.055 --> 01:12:09.889
Fourteen hundred.

01:12:10.057 --> 01:12:14.436
They can't raise the rent too much.
It's controlled by the city.

01:12:16.063 --> 01:12:17.981
Bless this city.

01:14:07.001 --> 01:14:10.254
- What did you think of the Wieniawski?
- Not bad.

01:14:10.421 --> 01:14:12.798
- I thought she milked it a bit.
- You think so?

01:14:12.966 --> 01:14:16.718
Well, when the piece is that romantic,
there's no need to embellish.

01:14:18.638 --> 01:14:20.264
I don't know. I loved it.

01:14:20.431 --> 01:14:23.099
I kept thinking about him
and his beloved Isabella.

01:14:23.267 --> 01:14:24.725
But that's not true.

01:14:24.893 --> 01:14:28.771
That whole, "He composed it to convince
her parents to let him marry her. "

01:14:28.939 --> 01:14:31.774
- It's a myth.
- I'm not like you.

01:14:31.942 --> 01:14:34.735
I prefer a little embellishment.

01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:42.617
- Finally.
- I'm sorry. Sorry.

01:14:42.785 --> 01:14:45.245
You guys look very thirsty.
What can I get you?

01:14:45.413 --> 01:14:46.830
Scotch on the rocks for me.

01:14:46.998 --> 01:14:51.126
Vodka and tonic, half a lime, no ice,
for the gentleman here.

01:14:51.294 --> 01:14:53.128
Busy tonight?

01:14:53.296 --> 01:14:54.921
It's Friday night.

01:14:55.089 --> 01:14:58.508
- The kids have taken our spot.
- Good for them.

01:14:58.676 --> 01:15:02.052
- You guys new in the neighborhood?
- Are you kidding?

01:15:02.220 --> 01:15:04.972
There was a famous "sip in"
right here in this bar...

01:15:05.140 --> 01:15:07.641
to challenge
the New York State regulation...

01:15:07.809 --> 01:15:11.395
that prohibited bars
from serving homosexuals.

01:15:11.563 --> 01:15:13.897
We have a clipping
from The New York Times.

01:15:14.065 --> 01:15:15.691
1966.

01:15:15.859 --> 01:15:19.737
Me and four other guys, we came in here
accompanied by five reporters.

01:15:19.904 --> 01:15:23.156
When denied service,
we denounced the state liquor authority.

01:15:23.324 --> 01:15:25.241
Oh, my God. You're that guy?

01:15:25.409 --> 01:15:27.994
Yeah, I was one of the guys.

01:15:28.162 --> 01:15:30.580
Well, this round's on me, fellas.

01:15:34.126 --> 01:15:36.502
- You are such a liar.
- What?

01:15:37.504 --> 01:15:40.423
- Anything for a free drink.
- Well, I knew the real guy.

01:15:40.591 --> 01:15:43.050
- Who, Frank?
- Yeah. That was his claim to fame.

01:15:43.217 --> 01:15:46.428
- I thought it was something different.
- Well, that too.

01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:54.269
Yeah, God bless him.

01:15:55.938 --> 01:15:58.565
- Here's to Frank's memory.
- Frank.

01:15:58.733 --> 01:16:01.567
- And to Ivan.
- Who's Ivan?

01:16:01.735 --> 01:16:04.278
The angel from Sussex
who got our apartment.

01:16:04.446 --> 01:16:05.738
- Ian.
- Yeah.

01:16:05.906 --> 01:16:09.325
Ivan, Ian. It doesn't matter.
I drink to him.

01:16:10.118 --> 01:16:12.703
A handsome stranger.

01:16:14.373 --> 01:16:17.166
Do I detect a note of jealousy
in your voice?

01:16:17.334 --> 01:16:21.544
I have wondered what you've been doing
with your free nights without me.

01:16:21.712 --> 01:16:23.880
That's not for me, Ben.

01:16:24.423 --> 01:16:26.007
You know that.

01:16:26.550 --> 01:16:28.385
For all these years?

01:16:28.552 --> 01:16:30.053
For all these years.

01:16:30.221 --> 01:16:32.013
Amazing.

01:16:34.684 --> 01:16:37.811
I'm sorry I can't say
the same to you, George.

01:16:39.021 --> 01:16:41.689
But at least
I've always been honest with you.

01:16:43.191 --> 01:16:46.527
Sometimes I think ignorance
might be a little better.

01:16:47.737 --> 01:16:49.822
I'm sorry, George.

01:16:50.740 --> 01:16:52.658
Mind you, come to think of it...

01:16:52.826 --> 01:16:55.953
there are things that you couldn't
have hidden anyway.

01:16:56.121 --> 01:16:58.414
- Like what?
- Like when you got crabs.

01:16:58.581 --> 01:16:59.832
Thanks for reminding me.

01:16:59.999 --> 01:17:02.375
Or that guy in Rio
who gave you the black eye.

01:17:02.543 --> 01:17:05.002
That crazy motherfucker
was trying to rob me!

01:17:08.632 --> 01:17:10.466
To all the crazy motherfuckers.

01:17:10.634 --> 01:17:12.593
All the crazy motherfuckers.

01:17:31.863 --> 01:17:34.156
- George.
- What?

01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:41.662
Remember we used to go
to Castelli and Mary Boone...

01:17:41.830 --> 01:17:44.457
and you would say...

01:17:44.624 --> 01:17:48.544
one day we'll go there
to see my one-man show?

01:17:48.712 --> 01:17:50.212
And we will.

01:17:50.380 --> 01:17:51.964
No, we won't, George.

01:17:52.132 --> 01:17:53.841
How do you know?

01:17:54.009 --> 01:17:58.554
Nowadays there's a new hot painter
discovered every week.

01:18:00.473 --> 01:18:03.016
Okay, maybe it'll happen,
but not in my lifetime.

01:18:03.184 --> 01:18:07.020
How do you know?
It's all a matter of trends and tastes.

01:18:07.188 --> 01:18:10.273
A curator will come along,
look at one of your paintings...

01:18:10.441 --> 01:18:12.734
and think this is the greatest thing.

01:18:12.902 --> 01:18:17.113
But if it doesn't happen,
I just would like to know...

01:18:18.824 --> 01:18:22.284
- ... is that disappointing to you?
- Not at all.

01:18:23.077 --> 01:18:26.580
And I say it because
I think it's a real possibility.

01:18:26.748 --> 01:18:30.834
I love your paintings, and frankly,
I don't care what anybody else thinks.

01:18:34.047 --> 01:18:36.924
I guess I did make
a couple of good ones, didn't I?

01:18:50.979 --> 01:18:52.939
- Oh, that hurts.
- Are you all right?

01:18:53.106 --> 01:18:56.150
- Careful of my arm.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:18:57.069 --> 01:18:59.278
I had a wonderful time.

01:18:59.446 --> 01:19:00.779
Me too.

01:19:11.332 --> 01:19:14.125
- Good night.
- Good night, Georgie.

01:20:29.197 --> 01:20:30.573
George.

01:20:30.741 --> 01:20:32.491
- Joey.
- Hi.

01:20:32.659 --> 01:20:35.369
- I didn't see you there.
- I was just waiting.

01:20:36.705 --> 01:20:38.915
- Do you wanna come up?
- Yeah, sure.

01:20:48.549 --> 01:20:50.550
- Here.
- Thank you.

01:20:55.014 --> 01:20:58.308
- This place is so nice.
- Yes, thanks.

01:20:58.893 --> 01:21:00.684
I got lucky.

01:21:15.033 --> 01:21:16.450
Uncle George, I'm...

01:21:17.577 --> 01:21:21.120
I'm sorry that I didn't go
to the service.

01:21:21.288 --> 01:21:22.789
The service?

01:21:23.540 --> 01:21:25.500
Uncle Ben's service.

01:21:27.753 --> 01:21:30.129
You know, funerals can be strange.

01:21:31.423 --> 01:21:33.508
Especially for people your age.

01:21:36.929 --> 01:21:41.139
I wanted to remember Uncle Ben
how I remember him now.

01:21:41.307 --> 01:21:43.850
And I'd never been
to a funeral before...

01:21:44.018 --> 01:21:46.311
and I was afraid
that if I went to his...

01:21:46.479 --> 01:21:50.399
that's how I would remember him
whenever I thought about him.

01:21:52.151 --> 01:21:54.486
That makes a lot of sense to me, Joey.

01:21:56.864 --> 01:22:01.200
But I hope you didn't come all this way
just because you felt guilty about it.

01:22:01.368 --> 01:22:03.995
Oh, no, actually, no. I...

01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:09.083
actually came to give you something.

01:22:32.189 --> 01:22:33.690
That's nice.

01:22:36.777 --> 01:22:38.570
That's very nice.

01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:42.823
I picked it up
from the top of the stairs...

01:22:42.991 --> 01:22:46.368
the day that Uncle Ben
had his accident.

01:22:46.536 --> 01:22:48.620
Everything came down...

01:22:49.581 --> 01:22:52.416
including Uncle Ben, as you know.

01:22:53.043 --> 01:22:56.670
But the painting was okay.

01:22:57.839 --> 01:22:59.213
Yeah.

01:22:59.381 --> 01:23:01.549
You know, I think he...

01:23:04.678 --> 01:23:08.014
I think he saved it mid-fall somehow.

01:23:09.975 --> 01:23:12.393
His paintings meant everything to him.

01:23:22.820 --> 01:23:27.074
Is this...? Is this the
view from your roof?

01:23:27.241 --> 01:23:29.326
Yeah, that's west.

01:23:30.578 --> 01:23:33.914
- Is this you in it? I didn't think so.
- No.

01:23:34.082 --> 01:23:35.916
That's my friend Vlad.

01:23:36.084 --> 01:23:39.627
He used to come over a lot
when Uncle Ben was living with us.

01:23:39.795 --> 01:23:43.380
Are you sure you don't want this?
It'd be a great memento.

01:23:43.548 --> 01:23:46.008
Oh, no. No, you keep it.

01:23:46.176 --> 01:23:48.511
It's his last painting.

01:23:48.678 --> 01:23:50.387
And it's unfinished.

01:23:50.555 --> 01:23:52.807
If you look over here...

01:23:52.974 --> 01:23:56.519
you can always imagine
what he would have done with the colors.

01:23:58.647 --> 01:24:00.396
It's very nice.

01:24:02.900 --> 01:24:06.194
I'm... I'm gonna find a hammer...

01:24:06.362 --> 01:24:09.280
and you can help me
hang it up on the wall.

01:24:09.448 --> 01:24:11.116
Yeah, sure.

01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:30.217
You can go.
