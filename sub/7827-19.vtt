Oh, they're gonna eat

01:01.895 --> 01:03.980
I'm not sure if I'm
comfortable with the idea

01:04.064 --> 01:07.776
of your classmates laughing
at our family's private moments.

01:07.859 --> 01:09.986
How would you like it
if 20 years from now

01:10.070 --> 01:11.696
people were laughing
at things you did?

01:11.780 --> 01:13.198
Not likely.

01:13.281 --> 01:16.367
Come on. Have a sense
of humor about yourself.

01:16.451 --> 01:19.204
I'm a big boy today.

01:19.287 --> 01:21.456
(laughing)

01:21.539 --> 01:24.167
(groans) I gotta find
something else quick.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.378
Why don't you bring this
potato? It's pretty big.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.714
Mom, you're always trying
to give me potatoes.

01:29.798 --> 01:32.634
-What is it with you?
-I just think they're neat.

01:33.927 --> 01:35.220
I need something
for show-and-tell.

01:35.303 --> 01:36.805
Just take one of my geodes.

01:37.931 --> 01:39.766
The rocks on my desk.

01:41.184 --> 01:43.853
No, that's a trilobite.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.814
That's petrified wood.

01:47.065 --> 01:49.359
Bart, that's a bran muffin!

01:49.442 --> 01:50.527
(school bus horn honks)

01:56.574 --> 01:59.702
Greetings, fellow geode-ologist.

01:59.786 --> 02:03.081
(groans)
I'll be right back!

02:05.959 --> 02:08.169
(growling)

02:10.088 --> 02:13.967
The ingredients were
fresh pureed tomatoes,

02:14.050 --> 02:17.220
water, salt and sodium benzoate

02:17.303 --> 02:19.556
used to retard spoilage.

02:19.639 --> 02:22.350
Once again,
if I'm not mistaken,

02:22.433 --> 02:25.979
this can contained
tomato paste.

02:26.062 --> 02:27.564
Thank you, Nelson.

02:27.647 --> 02:30.108
I look forward to seeing it
again next week.

02:30.191 --> 02:32.318
Bart, you're up.

02:36.197 --> 02:37.991
Boys and girls,
Mrs. Krabappel,

02:38.074 --> 02:40.076
I come before you today
to solve a riddle

02:40.160 --> 02:43.121
that has plagued
mankind for centuries.

02:43.204 --> 02:46.124
What has four legs
and ticks?

02:46.207 --> 02:48.918
-A walking clock?
-A walking clock!

02:49.002 --> 02:51.921
I'd wager he has some variety
of walking clock in that box.

02:52.005 --> 02:53.506
Bart, is it
a walking clock?

02:53.590 --> 02:56.301
What? No, it's my dog.

02:56.384 --> 02:59.762
-(all gasp)
-Oh, he is a gem!

02:59.846 --> 03:04.309
Here, boy. Would you like these
cookies Martin made for me?

03:04.392 --> 03:06.477
My raisin roundies!

03:06.561 --> 03:09.063
My dog's name is
Santa's Little Helper.

03:09.147 --> 03:10.982
One time he crawled under
the house, and when he came out,

03:11.065 --> 03:12.609
he was covered with ants.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.819
Then he ran into a church
and drank all the holy water.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.154
ALL: Wow!

03:16.237 --> 03:18.781
Thank you, Bart.
Great job.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.867
(all cheering)

03:20.950 --> 03:23.494
I knew the dog
before he came to class.

03:28.541 --> 03:33.004
Kaboom! That, the sound of
the thunderous volcanic explosion

03:33.087 --> 03:35.882
which gives birth
to the magnificent geode,

03:35.965 --> 03:37.842
one of nature's most--

03:37.926 --> 03:41.387
You're doing it wrong! You gotta
pet him hard so he can feel it.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.556
(grumbles, sneezes)

03:43.640 --> 03:45.683
Look, look, look!
The doggy sneezed!

03:45.767 --> 03:48.478
-Ha! It thinks it's people.
-(knocking)

03:48.561 --> 03:50.813
Oh, poochie. Here,
poochie, poochie, poochie!

03:50.897 --> 03:51.773
(grunts)

03:52.941 --> 03:53.900
(clears throat)

03:53.983 --> 03:56.569
My geode must be acknowledged.

03:56.653 --> 03:59.989
Oh, brother. All right.
Back to show-and-tell.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.575
Bart, why don't you
put the doggy away?

04:02.659 --> 04:05.453
(students groaning)

04:06.788 --> 04:08.873
(whimpers)

04:10.667 --> 04:13.169
(sniffing)

04:17.006 --> 04:19.425
Mmm.

04:19.509 --> 04:23.221
More testicles mean more iron.

04:23.304 --> 04:24.806
(moaning, whimpering)

04:29.852 --> 04:33.523
Uh, Miss Hoover,
there's a dog in the vent.

04:33.606 --> 04:37.735
Ralph, remember the time you
said Snagglepuss was outside?

04:37.819 --> 04:39.821
He was going to the bathroom.

04:41.656 --> 04:44.575
Uh, I-- I know Weinstein's
parents were upset,

04:44.659 --> 04:48.413
Superintendent, but I-- I was
sure it was a phony excuse.

04:48.496 --> 04:52.292
I mean, it sounds so made-up.
"Yom kip pur."

04:52.375 --> 04:53.751
(chuckles, stammers)

04:53.835 --> 04:56.629
(shouting, cheering)

04:56.713 --> 04:59.299
Sir, you've got to come quick!

04:59.382 --> 05:02.719
There's a dog runnin' around
in the air ducts!

05:02.802 --> 05:05.346
I understand. Children,
this is Principal Skinner.

05:05.430 --> 05:08.683
<i>Remain calm.</i>
<i>There is a dog in the vents.</i>

05:08.766 --> 05:12.145
(shouting, cheering)

05:14.522 --> 05:16.232
(grunts)

05:18.318 --> 05:21.779
(slobbers, panting)

05:21.863 --> 05:24.449
Willie, go into the vent
and get him!

05:24.532 --> 05:27.493
What? Have you gone
waxy in your "beester"?

05:27.577 --> 05:31.331
I cannot fit in the wee vent,
ya croquet-playin' mint muncher!

05:31.414 --> 05:33.833
Grease yourself up
and go in, you...

05:33.916 --> 05:35.918
you guff-speaking
work slacker.

05:36.002 --> 05:37.128
Ooh, good comeback.

05:38.588 --> 05:41.215
Lunch Lady Doris,
have you got any grease?

05:41.299 --> 05:42.759
Yes. Yes, we do.

05:42.842 --> 05:44.385
Then grease me up, woman!

05:44.469 --> 05:46.137
Okeydokey.

05:48.723 --> 05:50.641
(grunting)

05:57.065 --> 05:58.066
(gasps)

05:59.942 --> 06:01.277
(gasps)

06:01.361 --> 06:03.237
(beeping)

06:03.321 --> 06:04.614
(gasps)

06:04.697 --> 06:07.158
(beeping continues)

06:09.660 --> 06:11.662
-(beeping intensifies)
-Good Lord!

06:11.746 --> 06:12.872
It's coming up
right behind him!

06:12.955 --> 06:16.417
What the-- No! No!

06:16.501 --> 06:18.836
(laughing)

06:18.920 --> 06:20.421
(laughing continues)

06:20.505 --> 06:22.006
(students shouting)

06:23.424 --> 06:26.260
Ow! Ow! Stop it!

06:26.344 --> 06:28.930
Children, teachers,
back to your rooms.

06:29.013 --> 06:31.557
Uh-oh. Whenever I get
this upset, I get hiccups.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.059
(hiccups)
Oh, right on cue.

06:33.142 --> 06:35.812
(all laughing)

06:35.895 --> 06:37.980
-(barks)
-(grunts, groans)

06:48.449 --> 06:50.785
(grunts, laughs)

06:50.868 --> 06:54.705
There's nary an animal alive that
can outrun a greased Scotsman.

06:54.789 --> 06:57.708
Now, out we go.
(grunts)

06:58.876 --> 07:00.002
(gasps)

07:00.086 --> 07:02.296
'Tis more dizzyin'
than the belfry

07:02.380 --> 07:04.715
at St. Corgegluynwaagen's.

07:04.799 --> 07:07.552
(students murmuring)

07:08.886 --> 07:10.847
That's nice work, boys.

07:10.930 --> 07:11.973
(panting)

07:12.056 --> 07:13.599
MRS. KRABAPPEL:
Uh-oh!

07:13.683 --> 07:17.645
Someone's getting a visit
from Superintendent Chalmers.

07:17.728 --> 07:19.188
I... (hiccups)
can't... (hiccups)

07:19.272 --> 07:22.150
take... (hiccups)
this. (hiccups)

07:22.233 --> 07:25.236
-Skinner!
-Superintendent Chalmers,

07:25.319 --> 07:27.196
you didn't have to come
all the way down here.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.573
Everything's under control.

07:28.656 --> 07:31.075
(screams)

07:31.159 --> 07:32.493
Oh, I have had it!

07:32.577 --> 07:34.454
I have had it with
this school, Skinner!

07:34.537 --> 07:36.038
The low test scores,

07:36.122 --> 07:38.749
class after class of ugly,
ugly children!

07:38.833 --> 07:41.169
Oh, now I really think
the children's appearance--

07:41.252 --> 07:43.629
Seymour, you are in very,
very big trouble.

07:43.713 --> 07:45.965
-(barks)
-(gasps)

07:46.048 --> 07:50.178
Why, looking into this loveable
mutt's eyes just melts my heart.

07:50.261 --> 07:52.930
Seymour,
all is forgiven.

07:53.014 --> 07:55.308
(yelling)
Make way for Willie!

07:56.893 --> 08:00.271
I said make way for Willie,
ya bloated gasbag!

08:00.354 --> 08:02.273
-Seymour.
-Hmm?

08:02.356 --> 08:04.025
-You're fired!
-(gasps)

08:04.108 --> 08:07.195
I'm sorry. Did-- Did you
just call me a liar?

08:07.278 --> 08:08.696
No. I said you were fired.

08:08.779 --> 08:11.199
Oh. That's much worse.

08:12.366 --> 08:13.326
(hiccups)

08:18.080 --> 08:21.959
(gobbling, gulping)

08:22.043 --> 08:25.296
I thought I'd be jumping
for joy the day Skinner left,

08:25.379 --> 08:27.089
but now all I have
is this weird,

08:27.173 --> 08:29.842
hot feeling in
the back of my head.

08:29.926 --> 08:31.552
That's guilt. You feel guilty

08:31.636 --> 08:34.305
because your stunt wound up
costing a man his job.

08:34.388 --> 08:36.057
Yeah, I guess it is guilt.

08:38.935 --> 08:41.312
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let me get this straight.

08:41.395 --> 08:43.523
They let everybody
out of school early

08:43.606 --> 08:45.691
just because you
brought a dog?

08:45.775 --> 08:48.402
-Well, yeah, but--
-Well, I'm off to work.

08:48.486 --> 08:49.695
The dog has had
enough excitement.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.072
But, Marge,

08:51.155 --> 08:53.282
dogs can never have
enough excitement.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.201
Look. Whee! Whee!
(laughing)

08:55.284 --> 08:58.371
Whee, whee!
(laughing)

08:58.454 --> 09:01.958
All right, all right.
I won't take the dog. Come here.

09:02.041 --> 09:03.709
-(Marge groans)
-Aw.

09:05.670 --> 09:08.965
Boys and girls, because of
Mr. Skinner's sudden departure,

09:09.048 --> 09:11.717
I've had to appoint
a new principal.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.262
-Leopold.
-(all gasp)

09:14.345 --> 09:18.766
All right, you little punks.
Prick up your freakin' ears,

09:18.849 --> 09:21.185
because I'm only
gonna be saying this once.

09:21.269 --> 09:22.895
From now on,

09:22.979 --> 09:27.441
things are gonna be very,
very different around here--

09:27.525 --> 09:30.611
-(all gasp)
-...with your new principal, Ned Flanders.

09:30.695 --> 09:33.864
(applause, cheering)

09:33.948 --> 09:36.576
Well, tippity-top o' the a.m.
to every-good-body here.

09:36.659 --> 09:39.912
As chairman of the P.T.A.,
I am de-didilly-lighted to take over,

09:39.996 --> 09:42.790
and I think I can put
the "Pal" back in principal.

09:42.873 --> 09:46.168
(all laughing)

09:46.252 --> 09:49.547
Yeah, and I'll put the "super"
back in superintendent.

09:49.630 --> 09:52.300
(person coughs)

09:52.383 --> 09:54.969
It's the same exact joke.
What gives, Leo?

09:55.052 --> 09:57.805
Now, I know everybody's eager
to get back to class--

09:57.888 --> 09:59.640
MRS. KRABAPPEL:
Ha!

09:59.724 --> 10:01.017
But I thought
it might break the ice

10:01.100 --> 10:02.184
if we had a little "Q" and "A."

10:05.021 --> 10:08.482
Dude, ask a question,
or we'll have to go back to class.

10:08.566 --> 10:10.735
Um--

10:10.818 --> 10:12.570
-Yeah, you.
-Uh, yeah.

10:12.653 --> 10:15.906
Uh, I was wonderin',
do you, uh--

10:15.990 --> 10:20.661
What's your policy
on, uh, lunch?

10:20.745 --> 10:22.455
Well, let me just say

10:22.538 --> 10:25.166
I want to put the "stew"
back in students.

10:25.249 --> 10:27.960
(all laughing)

10:28.044 --> 10:32.214
It's just a damn popularity
contest with you kids.

10:32.298 --> 10:35.217
Now look what you've done,
you little freaks!

10:38.929 --> 10:41.515
Young man,
your gargantuan cone

10:41.599 --> 10:43.976
is making a mockery
of our self-serve policy.

10:44.060 --> 10:47.021
Bart, look.
It's Principal Skinner,

10:47.104 --> 10:48.898
and I think
he's gone crazy.

10:48.981 --> 10:51.734
He's not wearing
a suit or tie or anything.

10:51.817 --> 10:54.320
Principal Skinner, um,

10:54.403 --> 10:57.907
I'm real sorry about
my dog getting you fired

10:57.990 --> 11:01.744
and biting you and then
getting it on with your leg.

11:01.827 --> 11:04.497
Well, maybe
it was for the best.

11:04.580 --> 11:08.292
Now I-- I finally have time
to do what I've always wanted--

11:08.376 --> 11:10.002
Write the great American novel.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.338
Mine is about a
futuristic amusement park

11:12.421 --> 11:14.548
where dinosaurs
are brought to life

11:14.632 --> 11:17.218
through advanced
cloning techniques.

11:17.301 --> 11:19.887
I call it
"Billy and the Clone-osaurus."

11:19.970 --> 11:21.889
Oh, you have got
to be kidding, sir.

11:21.972 --> 11:24.475
First you think of an idea
that has already been done.

11:24.558 --> 11:26.727
Then you give it a title
that nobody could possibly like.

11:26.811 --> 11:28.187
Didn't you think this through?

11:28.270 --> 11:30.231
...on the best-seller
list for 18 months!

11:30.314 --> 11:31.607
Every magazine cover
had it!

11:31.691 --> 11:34.110
...most popular movies
of all time, sir!

11:34.193 --> 11:35.611
What were you thinking?

11:37.154 --> 11:38.614
I mean, thank you.
Come again.

11:42.702 --> 11:45.204
Bart, I've barely been here
a-a good solid week,

11:45.287 --> 11:47.498
and you've been sent
to my office 11 times.

11:47.581 --> 11:49.959
And now that I have
peanut butter cups,

11:50.042 --> 11:52.002
you seem to be getting
in trouble every hour.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.921
Must have been a coincidence.

11:54.004 --> 11:56.549
Anyhoo, Bart, you're
gonna have to be punished.

11:56.632 --> 11:58.300
This isn't just
some sort of clubhouse.

11:58.384 --> 11:59.844
(ice rattles)

11:59.927 --> 12:02.388
Oh, sorry. Were you
drinking Slice or Yoo-hoo?

12:02.471 --> 12:07.518
Now let's see.
"Tide. Cheer.

12:07.601 --> 12:11.313
"Bold. Biz.

12:11.397 --> 12:14.316
"Fab. All.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.862
Gain. Wisk."

12:17.945 --> 12:22.241
I believe today
I will try... Bold.

12:22.324 --> 12:25.411
Bart, how are you?
How's school?

12:25.494 --> 12:29.123
Um, it's--
It's a lot of fun.

12:29.206 --> 12:31.208
Hmm.

12:31.292 --> 12:35.212
Well, it was good
to see you.

12:35.296 --> 12:37.298
It was? Well, then we
should get together again.

12:37.381 --> 12:39.717
Say, Saturday at my house.
Do you know where I live?

12:39.800 --> 12:41.510
Uh, no.

12:45.848 --> 12:48.100
Hmm. A flaming bag, eh?

12:48.184 --> 12:51.812
Well, these new Italian loafers
will make short work of it.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.274
Uh, I'm kinda busy
on Saturday.

12:55.357 --> 12:56.567
(grunts, laughs)

12:56.650 --> 12:57.902
Hey!

12:57.985 --> 12:59.987
(chanting)
We got Skinner's underpants!

13:00.070 --> 13:04.074
And there's nothing
you can do about it, Mr. Ex-principal.

13:04.158 --> 13:07.161
That's not true.
I can buy a new pair.

13:07.244 --> 13:10.664
No, I can't.
I needed those. I really did.

13:18.380 --> 13:21.550
Oh, you must be
Seymour's friend.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.970
He's up in his room.
Don't touch the wallpaper.

13:25.054 --> 13:28.474
-♪♪ (Beethoven's 5th Symphony)
<i>-♪ Ba-ba-ba-bum ♪</i>

13:28.557 --> 13:31.018
<i>♪ Ba-ba-ba-bum ♪</i>

13:31.101 --> 13:33.687
Now a little more allegro
than last time. Bart!

13:33.771 --> 13:35.523
(chuckles)
Welcome.

13:35.606 --> 13:38.025
Can I offer you a diet
caffeine-free Dr. Pepper

13:38.108 --> 13:40.528
or an individual
fruit cocktail cup?

13:40.611 --> 13:42.154
Uh, I'll pass.

13:42.238 --> 13:43.781
Hey, what's this?

13:43.864 --> 13:46.492
Oh, that's my old unit
from Vietnam.

13:46.575 --> 13:49.537
I was their sergeant.
They were my loyal troops.

13:49.620 --> 13:52.748
That photo was taken shortly
before I was shot in the back,

13:52.832 --> 13:55.543
which was very strange because
it was during a Bob Hope show.

13:55.626 --> 13:59.046
I was trying to get Joey Heatherton to
put on some pants, for God's sake!

13:59.129 --> 14:01.048
Seymour, your friend
Bart is here!

14:01.131 --> 14:02.925
I know, Mother!

14:03.008 --> 14:06.428
Seymour, do you want me
to tell you when it's 7:30?

14:06.512 --> 14:07.972
No, Mother!

14:08.055 --> 14:11.517
(laughing)

14:11.600 --> 14:14.728
Ned Flanders actually
eliminated detention

14:14.812 --> 14:17.648
and put the whole school
on the honor system?

14:17.731 --> 14:21.527
(laughs) Yeah. The teachers
are afraid to leave the faculty lounge.

14:21.610 --> 14:23.696
(both laughing)

14:23.779 --> 14:27.241
Oh, that place must be
falling apart.

14:27.324 --> 14:29.910
Oh, mercy.

14:29.994 --> 14:32.162
Nobody's
mentioned me, have they?

14:32.246 --> 14:35.749
Uh, I thought I heard someone
say your name in the cafeteria,

14:35.833 --> 14:38.168
But they might have been
saying "skim milk."

14:38.252 --> 14:39.336
Yeah, yeah.

14:41.797 --> 14:43.883
Hmm.

14:43.966 --> 14:48.554
-(claw snips)
-Ahh! Ohh! Yee!

14:48.637 --> 14:50.848
I thought you might like
this restaurant, Bart.

14:50.931 --> 14:53.601
They'll make a pizza pie
with a topping of your choice.

14:53.684 --> 14:56.186
Hey, Seymour!
You want your usual table?

14:56.270 --> 14:57.813
No, no, Luigi.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.899
I'd like one with two seats.

14:59.982 --> 15:01.609
I'll be dining
with a friend tonight.

15:01.692 --> 15:04.403
Hey, good for you, huh?

15:07.615 --> 15:09.325
Hmm. They treat you
real nice here.

15:09.408 --> 15:11.493
Hey, Salvatore,
guess who's here!

15:11.577 --> 15:14.788
Mr. Kookalamanza
and-a some real ugly kid.

15:14.872 --> 15:17.708
(students shouting)

15:22.588 --> 15:25.424
This is great!
Not only am I not learnin',

15:25.507 --> 15:27.635
I'm forgettin' stuff
I used to know.

15:27.718 --> 15:30.638
(laughs)
And it's all thanks to you, Bart.

15:30.721 --> 15:31.722
Yeah, great.

15:31.805 --> 15:33.599
What's the matter?

15:33.682 --> 15:36.644
Don't you see, Milhouse?
We've gone too far.

15:36.727 --> 15:40.898
-We need Skinner back.
-My water dish is empty!

15:44.401 --> 15:46.946
(school bell rings)

15:47.029 --> 15:49.657
GIRL'S VOICE: <i>I learned to read</i>
<i>because of you, Principal Skinner.</i>

15:49.740 --> 15:51.951
MARTIN: <i>Sir, I baked you</i>
<i>these raisin roundies.</i>

15:52.034 --> 15:55.746
RALPH: <i>Principal Skinner, I got</i>
<i>carsick in your office.</i>

15:55.829 --> 15:58.499
(sobbing)

16:03.587 --> 16:06.173
Oh, you're Seymour's friend.

16:06.256 --> 16:08.133
Here. He left you this note.

16:08.217 --> 16:09.551
SKINNER:
<i>Dear Bart...</i>

16:12.721 --> 16:14.807
<i>However, I've decided to return</i>
<i>to the only thing besides school</i>

16:14.890 --> 16:17.059
<i>that has ever given</i>
<i>my life meaning--</i>

16:23.399 --> 16:25.067
(groans)

16:28.153 --> 16:29.780
Table for one.

16:29.863 --> 16:32.866
Oh, you miss your friend, huh?
Don't you worry.

16:32.950 --> 16:36.662
My cooking,
she'll-a cheer you up.

16:36.745 --> 16:40.541
Hey, Salvatore, give-a the ugly kid
a pan of the red crap!

16:46.296 --> 16:48.674
It's good to have another
combat veteran around here.

16:48.757 --> 16:51.135
I myself received
a number of medals

16:51.218 --> 16:54.138
for securing that Montgomery Ward
in Kuwait City.

16:54.221 --> 16:56.557
Mm, yes, colonel. Now,
I understand it'll be my duty

16:56.640 --> 16:58.767
to mold the new recruits
into a well-disciplined,

16:58.851 --> 17:00.436
highly trained infantry unit.

17:00.519 --> 17:02.438
Sure, I guess.
Here they come.

17:02.521 --> 17:03.772
(vehicle approaching)

17:03.856 --> 17:07.109
(chattering)

17:07.192 --> 17:09.069
Hi. Where do I get
my grenades at?

17:09.153 --> 17:11.905
Uh, they don't have them group
toilets here no more, do they?

17:15.200 --> 17:17.411
Ned, Homer and I are
a little concerned

17:17.494 --> 17:19.288
with the way
the school's being run.

17:19.371 --> 17:21.915
Yes, deeply concerned.

17:21.999 --> 17:25.127
Well, I may go a little bit easy on
the old hickory dickory stick,

17:25.210 --> 17:29.131
but that's just because my dad
was so hard on me when I was a boy.

17:33.260 --> 17:35.512
Whoopsy-doodle.

17:35.596 --> 17:40.309
Oh, man! Ned spilled ink
all over my poems!

17:40.392 --> 17:43.562
He's a real flat tire.
I mean a cube, man.

17:43.645 --> 17:46.523
He's putting us on the train
to Squaresville, Mona.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.236
Hmm?

17:51.320 --> 17:54.573

17:54.656 --> 17:56.533

Wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:58.702 --> 18:01.371
We heard Sergeant Clark's
company singing it, sir.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.457
Yes, well, there will be
no smut in my company.

18:03.540 --> 18:05.250

18:21.225 --> 18:23.477
(sighs)

18:23.560 --> 18:26.146
Wow, I never thought Principal Skinner
could become any more of a square,

18:26.230 --> 18:27.523
but there's the proof.

18:27.606 --> 18:29.024
It's weird, Lis.

18:29.108 --> 18:30.275
I miss him as a friend,

18:30.359 --> 18:32.277
but I miss him even more
as an enemy.

18:32.361 --> 18:35.906
I think you need Skinner, Bart.
Everybody needs a nemesis.

18:35.989 --> 18:37.950
Sherlock Holmes
had his Dr. Moriarty.

18:38.033 --> 18:39.993
Mountain Dew
has its Mello Yello.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.496
Even Maggie has that baby
with the one eyebrow.

18:44.039 --> 18:45.999
(wheel squeaking)

18:56.802 --> 18:59.513
(incoming ordnance)

19:01.473 --> 19:03.559
Man on the range!
Change your trajectory!

19:03.642 --> 19:05.394
(all grunting)

19:05.477 --> 19:07.980
Sixteen brand-new
gas pumps!

19:08.063 --> 19:10.816
At last we can compete
with the Gas-n-Gulp.

19:10.899 --> 19:14.987
(incoming ordnance)

19:15.070 --> 19:17.197
If there was some way
to get rid of Flanders,

19:17.281 --> 19:18.782
would you want to come back?

19:18.866 --> 19:21.243
Ah, I must admit
I do miss the school.

19:21.326 --> 19:25.247
Frankly, the army isn't
quite as I remembered it.

19:25.330 --> 19:27.791
Up yours, Sergeant!

19:27.875 --> 19:29.960
Actually, it's exactly
as I remembered it.

19:30.043 --> 19:32.254
I do want
to come back, Bart,

19:32.337 --> 19:35.632
but it doesn't sound like
Flanders is gonna get fired.

19:35.716 --> 19:38.010
Oh, I think
I could get him fired.

19:38.093 --> 19:39.803
I got you fired, didn't I?

19:39.887 --> 19:41.054
(laughing)

19:41.138 --> 19:42.598
Yes.

19:42.681 --> 19:45.809
Now, you realize if
I become principal again,

19:45.893 --> 19:47.936
we can no longer be friends,

19:48.020 --> 19:49.730
unless you become
a good student.

19:49.813 --> 19:52.649
Hmm. That's probably
never gonna happen.

19:52.733 --> 19:56.278
Well, we'll always
have the Laundromat.

19:56.361 --> 19:57.571
Yeah.

20:02.618 --> 20:04.286
What's he doing here?

20:04.369 --> 20:05.704
Well, once he found out
we were gonna get

20:05.787 --> 20:08.707
Ned Flanders fired,
he insisted on helping.

20:08.790 --> 20:09.833
That is true.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.168
Here's the plan.

20:11.251 --> 20:12.586
Once Chalmers comes for his
next inspection

20:12.669 --> 20:14.713
and sees how crappy
the school has gotten,

20:14.796 --> 20:17.049
he'll fire Ned on the spot.

20:17.132 --> 20:20.010
Uh, one question remains:
How do I get out of the army?

20:20.093 --> 20:22.888
<i>No problemo.</i> Just make a pass
at your commanding officer.

20:22.971 --> 20:25.724
Done and done.
And I mean done.

20:25.807 --> 20:27.226
(knocking)

20:27.309 --> 20:28.310
MARGE:
What's going on in there?

20:28.393 --> 20:29.603
ALL:
Nothing.

20:31.271 --> 20:34.274
(students shouting)

20:34.358 --> 20:37.903
(singing opera)

20:37.986 --> 20:40.697
Come on, Chalmie. You fired
Skinner for less than this.

20:40.781 --> 20:44.159
Yeah, I did, but Skinner
really bugged me.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.495
Besides, the way America's
public schools are sliding,

20:46.578 --> 20:48.413
they'll all be this way
in a few months.

20:48.497 --> 20:51.667
I say lay back and enjoy it.
It's a hell of a toboggan ride.

20:51.750 --> 20:54.211
NED:<i> Well, cockilly-doodilly-do,</i>
<i>little buddies.</i>

20:54.294 --> 20:58.507
<i>Let's thank the Lord for</i>
<i>another beautiful school day.</i>

20:58.590 --> 21:02.719
Thank the Lor-- Thank the Lord?
That sounded like a prayer.

21:02.803 --> 21:06.640
A prayer! A prayer
in a public school!

21:06.723 --> 21:09.351
God has no place
within these walls,

21:09.434 --> 21:12.187
just like facts have no place
within organized religion!

21:12.271 --> 21:15.941
Simpson, you get your wish.
Flanders is history.

21:16.024 --> 21:18.819
(humming)

21:18.902 --> 21:22.114
Well, I really enjoyed my
time here, Superintendent.

21:22.197 --> 21:24.783
May the Lord
bless and keep you.

21:24.866 --> 21:26.618
Yeah, take it outside,

21:28.495 --> 21:30.956
Dirksen, tuck in your shirt.
Jaffee, spit out that gum.

21:31.039 --> 21:34.710
You really think it's a good idea
to give that freak his job back?

21:34.793 --> 21:36.837
Ah, he seems to know
the students' names.

21:38.255 --> 21:41.258
So, I guess
we're enemies again.

21:41.341 --> 21:43.385
I guess.

21:43.468 --> 21:44.428

21:44.511 --> 21:46.305
Sure.
