One thing we can discuss while

02:55.542 --> 02:57.708
You know, you can see
what we drilled around there.

02:57.875 --> 03:00.833
SCOTT:
We have five holes all along
there defining a tunnel.

03:00.958 --> 03:02.000
MARTY:
Right.

03:02.125 --> 03:05.333
So we started out with K-15.5.

03:05.417 --> 03:06.958
-K-15.5?
-SCOTT: Yeah.

03:07.042 --> 03:09.750
So we drilled there
and we hit a direct hit.

03:09.875 --> 03:11.417
We hit wood around 103 feet.

03:11.542 --> 03:13.792
I mean, it was the
first time that we felt

03:13.875 --> 03:15.750
that we had ever drilled into
a tunnel that was still open.

03:15.875 --> 03:17.500
Yeah.

03:17.625 --> 03:18.958
Whoa, what's that?
Whoa, whoa, what's that?

<i>NARRATOR: One recent

<i>is considering for

03:27.292 --> 03:29.958
<i>is a five-foot-high

03:30.083 --> 03:33.667
<i>which they have encountered at
five separate drilling locations</i>

03:33.750 --> 03:36.333
<i>at a depth of 103 feet.</i>

03:36.458 --> 03:38.667
<i>This structure has not only been</i>

03:38.792 --> 03:41.917
<i>carbon-dated to as early
as the 17th century</i>

03:42.042 --> 03:43.750
<i>but may also be leading</i>

03:43.875 --> 03:46.792
<i>in the direction
of the Garden Shaft.</i>

03:46.875 --> 03:49.333
<i>RICK:
Here we have a man-made
structure underground</i>

03:49.458 --> 03:51.167
<i>at a consistent elevation.</i>

03:51.292 --> 03:54.000
So of course, your mind runs
to the possibility

03:54.125 --> 03:58.167
that this tunnel,
if it is confirmed,

03:58.292 --> 04:00.208
runs towards the Garden Shaft.

04:00.333 --> 04:01.750
And there might be
"X marks the spot"

04:01.875 --> 04:03.125
at the end of that tunnel.

04:03.250 --> 04:04.667
CRAIG:
You know, then the question is,

04:04.750 --> 04:07.500
do we continue
pursuing this tunnel?

04:07.625 --> 04:13.167
Or is there a want
to move to D-17.5?

04:13.250 --> 04:16.417
This one is right offset
to the Garden Shaft,

04:16.542 --> 04:19.792
where we could intercept
this 70-foot tunnel,

04:19.917 --> 04:23.250
which was first found in D-17.

04:23.375 --> 04:25.750
<i>NARRATOR:
Five weeks ago,</i>

04:25.875 --> 04:29.500
<i>the team drilled into
another tunnel in Borehole D-17,</i>

04:29.625 --> 04:31.875
<i>at a depth of just 70 feet</i>

04:32.000 --> 04:33.500
<i>that they've speculated</i>

04:33.583 --> 04:35.333
<i>could be leading to
an offset treasure chamber</i>

04:35.458 --> 04:38.542
<i>extending away from
the original Money Pit.</i>

04:38.708 --> 04:40.292
It's odd that it's
at that depth.

04:40.375 --> 04:42.333
It almost has to be
an offset chamber.

04:42.458 --> 04:45.458
There's no point having an
upward facing tunnel, is there?

04:45.583 --> 04:48.125
<i>NARRATOR: What makes this
an ideal location</i>

04:48.208 --> 04:50.333
<i>for the team to investigate now,</i>

04:50.500 --> 04:54.500
<i>is that it sets just 20 feet
south of the Garden Shaft.</i>

04:55.708 --> 04:58.917
<i>Because when they and the team
from Dumas Contracting Limited</i>

04:59.042 --> 05:02.625
<i>are given permission to continue
with the operation to clear out</i>

05:02.750 --> 05:05.667
<i>and reconstruct a new,
waterproof shaft</i>

<i>down to at least
the 80-foot depth,</i>

<i>if any evidence of
man-made voids or structures</i>

05:11.500 --> 05:13.333
<i>are detected nearby,</i>

05:13.458 --> 05:16.667
<i>lateral tunnels can be
constructed off the main shaft</i>

<i>in order to allow the team to
search for potential valuables.</i>

05:20.958 --> 05:24.375
<i>RICK:
Finding the wood in D-17
is important simply because</i>

05:24.500 --> 05:26.750
it suggests strongly that
this is original work.

05:26.875 --> 05:30.500
<i>We've never encountered wood
at that elevation before.</i>

05:30.667 --> 05:33.958
<i>So everything that we find,
everything we uncover,</i>

05:34.042 --> 05:36.500
will be new to us
and thus will be exciting.

05:36.583 --> 05:38.500
CRAIG:
So we're actually
looking for two things--

05:38.625 --> 05:41.792
the 70-foot
and the 100-foot tunnel?

05:41.875 --> 05:43.083
-Yep.
-MARTY: Okay.

05:43.208 --> 05:44.167
So, where are we
going next, then?

05:44.292 --> 05:45.417
We should talk about it.

05:45.542 --> 05:47.792
-Yeah.
-CRAIG: To me, I guess,

05:47.875 --> 05:49.500
do we want to
look for this tunnel

05:49.625 --> 05:53.667
up towards
the Garden Shaft at D-17?

05:53.792 --> 05:55.375
We have no records
of this tunnel.

05:55.542 --> 05:58.167
Is it a tunnel leading to
an offset chamber?

05:58.292 --> 06:01.000
Yeah. Possibly.

06:01.125 --> 06:06.583
CRAIG:
So we could drill a well to try
to define this D-17 tunnel

06:06.708 --> 06:10.125
-at D-17.5.
-MARTY: Yeah, yeah.

06:10.208 --> 06:11.208
As long as we're getting
the gold data,

06:11.333 --> 06:12.625
I guess I'm okay with it.

06:12.750 --> 06:14.917
For me,
that's the objective there.

06:15.042 --> 06:17.667
Really get an idea of
the orientation of the tunnel.

06:17.792 --> 06:20.458
-Yeah.
-So those are my thoughts.

06:20.542 --> 06:21.792
CRAIG:
Yeah, okay.

06:21.917 --> 06:25.458
So we're gonna
move down to D-17.5.

06:25.583 --> 06:26.750
MARTY:
Good.

06:26.875 --> 06:28.875

more about that thing.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.875

We can measure the diameter

11:40.042 --> 11:41.583

<i>on Lot 10 where Tom's
late father Fred Nolan</i>

Yes, definitely.</i>

<i>Stephan is prepared to review
his findings with the team.</i>

13:32.417 --> 13:37.292
<i>So let me start with the scans

13:42.167 --> 13:43.958
<i>Coming from the left
to the right</i>

<i>at around three feet depth.</i>

13:46.750 --> 13:51.208
<i>I quickly want to
open another scan.</i>

13:52.833 --> 13:55.833
<i>This is very interesting</i>

13:55.917 --> 13:57.833
<i>because we do see here again</i>

13:58.000 --> 14:00.542
<i>anomalies cut
in the middle of the grid</i>

14:00.667 --> 14:02.083
<i>from the left to the right</i>

14:02.208 --> 14:05.125
<i>and those are between two
and eight feet depth.</i>

14:05.250 --> 14:08.333
<i>So it's a duplication
more or less.</i>

14:08.500 --> 14:09.792
Wow.

14:09.875 --> 14:11.458
<i>NARRATOR:
Numerous anomalies</i>

14:11.583 --> 14:13.208
<i>running in a linear pattern</i>

14:13.333 --> 14:15.250
<i>between three

14:15.375 --> 14:17.208
<i>just north of the swamp?</i>

14:17.375 --> 14:20.125
<i>Could it be evidence to
support Fred Nolan's theory</i>

<i>regarding a potential
man-made dam?</i>

14:24.750 --> 14:27.625
<i>RICK:
The information
that Stephan relayed to us,</i>

14:27.750 --> 14:29.875
<i>I found it
incredibly intriguing.</i>

14:30.042 --> 14:32.667
<i>His interpretation
of the data suggests</i>

14:32.750 --> 14:36.042
<i>a linear anomaly is in an area
that Fred thought was certainly</i>

14:36.167 --> 14:38.375
<i>worthy of further investigation.</i>

14:38.500 --> 14:41.750
<i>I believe that Fred was
truthful about probing</i>

14:41.875 --> 14:44.000
<i>such a structure
or finding such a structure.</i>

14:44.125 --> 14:46.833
And I think
if you come to a point

14:46.958 --> 14:48.833
where you think
a target is legit,

14:48.958 --> 14:51.042
then you need to dig.

14:51.167 --> 14:53.708
Well, thank you for that
because it's very curious.

14:53.875 --> 14:56.042
Craig, do you have any thoughts?

14:56.208 --> 15:00.833
Just, uh, I mean,
get Tom involved, um, obviously.

15:00.958 --> 15:02.167
So it'll be interesting to see

15:02.292 --> 15:03.875
what he thinks
about this location.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.417
Yeah, 100%.

15:06.542 --> 15:09.417
<i>The next steps would be
obviously to inform Tom.</i>

15:09.542 --> 15:13.458
<i>And then it would be up to Tom
to decide how to proceed.</i>

15:13.583 --> 15:15.833
<i>My hope is, after hearing
there is an anomaly there,</i>

15:16.000 --> 15:18.833
that Tom will
acquiesce to, to dig.

15:18.917 --> 15:21.375
Anyways, Stephan,
I hate to say it,

15:21.542 --> 15:25.000
but... you're gonna be
getting a lot more data.

15:25.083 --> 15:27.458
(laughs)
I'm looking forward to it.

15:27.542 --> 15:29.125

<i>during the 19th

A piece right there.

chunk of wood right there,

a split beam or something,
we're not sure.

17:41.292 --> 17:42.958

-But it's upright.

17:44.167 --> 17:45.375
Seems to be an upright, yeah.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.000
TERRY:
Now we have the possibility

of some kind of shaft
rather than a tunnel.

17:49.958 --> 17:51.375
-CRAIG: Right.
-At that unusual depth.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.667
It's got to be a shaft.
But which one?

17:53.792 --> 17:56.083
It's got to be between
the spot we're drilling

17:56.208 --> 17:58.625
-and the Garden Shaft.
-Yeah.
-CHARLES: Yeah.

17:58.708 --> 18:01.708

19:04.125 --> 19:05.375

19:05.500 --> 19:07.625
And then we've got
a ton of wood here.

19:09.875 --> 19:12.917
So we're starting to think maybe
the 70-foot was not a tunnel.

19:13.042 --> 19:14.500
A piece of a shaft.

19:14.625 --> 19:17.208
-Yeah.
-So it's yet another
unknown shaft.

19:17.333 --> 19:18.833
-CRAIG: Yeah.
-Exactly.

it's not a tunnel at all.

19:33.375 --> 19:35.917

the touch of man there.

20:35.708 --> 20:38.583

irregular and uneven.

an indication that it was older.

the layers going down.

Then you've got peat.

28:34.417 --> 28:37.125

28:37.250 --> 28:38.917
So...

28:39.042 --> 28:40.250

Yeah, you would think
anything below that

28:40.375 --> 28:41.958
is original ground.

28:42.958 --> 28:44.792

do you want to go?

28:46.542 --> 28:48.500

28:48.667 --> 28:50.375
Mm-hmm.

28:51.917 --> 28:54.875
RICK:
What you'd have to do
is get a proper permit.

28:55.042 --> 28:56.625
It's the only way
you'd know for sure.

28:56.708 --> 28:58.833
-That you didn't miss it.
-Yeah.

this exercise is to prove

29:01.625 --> 29:06.333
that what Tom's father Fred
found-- a dam-- exists.

29:06.458 --> 29:10.750
The way to address that is
by getting the proper permits.

37:43.208 --> 37:44.875
-Most likely Roman.
-(laughs)

37:45.000 --> 37:46.292
Roman, baby!

37:46.417 --> 37:47.375
-(laughter)
-(laughs) Oh!

37:47.542 --> 37:48.875
Have I waited for this.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.708
Put it in probably Roman.

37:50.875 --> 37:52.083
-That's my gut.
-Mm.

37:52.208 --> 37:53.125
SANDY:
So...

37:53.250 --> 37:54.292
What do you make of that?

37:54.375 --> 37:55.917
That is incredible, mate.

37:56.042 --> 37:57.250
Incredible!

37:57.375 --> 37:59.167
RICK:
Run it by me again.

37:59.250 --> 38:02.333
Why is it possibly Roman?

38:02.458 --> 38:06.625
Well, it-it--
the design is definitely Roman.

38:08.500 --> 38:10.875
<i>This is definitely
a person here,</i>

38:11.042 --> 38:12.333
<i>and this is a tree here.</i>

38:12.458 --> 38:14.042
<i>RICK:
Oh, yeah.</i>

38:14.208 --> 38:16.375
<i>SANDY:
This style is Roman.</i>

38:16.500 --> 38:18.625
Does the elemental analysis

38:18.750 --> 38:22.583
confirm what you suspect
about the coin?

38:22.708 --> 38:24.750
SANDY:
Yeah, when I--
when I see arsenic

38:24.875 --> 38:27.500
and I see silver in there,
y-you know,

38:27.625 --> 38:29.917
it's a very unrefined copper,

38:30.042 --> 38:31.333
which shows that--

38:31.417 --> 38:33.500
again, really confirms with me

38:33.625 --> 38:36.333
that it's probably,
most likely Roman.

38:36.458 --> 38:38.375
A Roman coin on Oak Island?

38:38.500 --> 38:40.000
-Mm-hmm.
-What's it doing here?

38:40.083 --> 38:42.458
So, when we were in Portugal,
we were investigating

38:42.542 --> 38:44.375
the road that we found
in the swamp, right?

38:44.500 --> 38:47.042
And we saw an example of
a Roman road over in Portugal.

38:47.167 --> 38:48.833
<i>CORJAN:
Oh. Morning.</i>

38:48.917 --> 38:50.625
-Welcome to Portugal.
-RICK: Thank you.

38:50.708 --> 38:52.250
<i>NARRATOR:
One year ago,</i>

38:52.375 --> 38:54.167
<i>Rick, Alex
and members of the team</i>

38:54.250 --> 38:57.833
<i>visited a number
of locations in Portugal</i>

38:58.000 --> 38:59.667
<i>where the Knights Templar
established strongholds</i>

38:59.833 --> 39:02.417
<i>between the 12th
and 16th centuries.</i>

39:02.542 --> 39:04.500
Okay, let's see
what we can find.

39:04.625 --> 39:06.208
<i>NARRATOR:
There, they were shown</i>

39:06.333 --> 39:08.000
<i>a number of carvings
in Templar churches</i>

39:08.125 --> 39:11.542
<i>matching symbols that have been
found in the past on Oak Island.</i>

39:11.667 --> 39:13.500
This symbol is definitely
on the 90 Foot Stone.

39:13.667 --> 39:14.792
-Right there.
-RICK: That's perfect.

39:14.875 --> 39:16.292
ALEX:
Yep.

39:16.375 --> 39:18.583
The stone path
looks exactly like this.

39:18.708 --> 39:21.625
<i>NARRATOR:
But one of the most compelling
features they saw</i>

39:21.750 --> 39:25.292
<i>was a cobblestone road
dating back nearly 2,000 years</i>

39:25.417 --> 39:29.458
<i>to a time when the area was
once part of the Roman Empire.</i>

39:29.542 --> 39:32.958
<i>Incredibly,
the road was an exact match</i>

39:33.042 --> 39:36.958
<i>to the one unearthed in
the swamp by the team in 2020,</i>

39:37.042 --> 39:40.375
<i>which is believed to date back
at least 500 years</i>

39:40.542 --> 39:43.333
<i>and be of Portuguese origin.</i>

39:43.417 --> 39:47.000
So maybe the coin
and the road in the swamp

39:47.125 --> 39:48.833
-are connected.
-GARY: Yeah.

39:48.958 --> 39:51.167
<i>NARRATOR:
Is it possible
that this Roman coin</i>

39:51.333 --> 39:53.417
<i>may have been brought
to Oak Island</i>

39:53.542 --> 39:55.750
<i>by members
of the Knights Templar?</i>

39:55.875 --> 39:58.708
<i>If so, could it also explain</i>

39:58.833 --> 40:02.500
<i>the possible dam feature
at the north end of the swamp,</i>

40:02.625 --> 40:07.500
<i>the medieval lead cross
found in 2017 at Smith's Cove,</i>

40:07.583 --> 40:10.833
<i>or even perhaps
the high traces of gold</i>

40:10.958 --> 40:13.792
<i>that have been detected
in the Money Pit area?</i>

40:13.875 --> 40:16.833
<i>RICK:
A Roman-era coin on Oak Island--</i>

40:16.958 --> 40:18.458
<i>it's astounding.</i>

40:18.542 --> 40:20.917
<i>It's undeniable
that there is a certain</i>

40:21.042 --> 40:23.292
geographic connection.

40:23.375 --> 40:25.833
But is it Templar-related?
I don't know.

40:26.000 --> 40:29.333
<i>We have to put it through more
rigorous scientific analysis.</i>

40:29.458 --> 40:31.667
This story
is incredibly complex.

40:31.833 --> 40:33.583
I know one thing for sure--

40:33.708 --> 40:37.625
Lot 5 is now on the Oak Island
treasure map for sure.

40:37.708 --> 40:39.000
-Yeah.
-(chuckles)

40:39.125 --> 40:40.333
Sandy, y-you know,

40:40.458 --> 40:42.292
we-we welcome your expertise.

40:42.375 --> 40:45.042
-And if you can continue to look
into this, uh, we would...
-I will.

40:45.208 --> 40:48.583
...we would love whatever
information comes of that.

40:48.708 --> 40:50.333
And we need to get back out
to Lot 5.

40:50.458 --> 40:51.667
We do, mate.
"Boots on the ground,"

40:51.792 --> 40:53.667
-as you would say.
-Yeah.

40:53.750 --> 40:55.500
<i>-Thank you very much.
-LAIRD: Let's go find more.</i>

40:55.625 --> 40:57.458
<i>-ALEX: Yep.
-RICK: All right, let's go.</i>

40:58.500 --> 40:59.917
<i>NARRATOR:
With each new discovery</i>

41:00.042 --> 41:02.167
<i>that Rick, Marty
and their team make,</i>

41:02.250 --> 41:04.333
<i>the confounding puzzle</i>

41:04.417 --> 41:07.625
<i>that is the 228-year-old
Oak Island mystery</i>

41:07.708 --> 41:11.292
<i>is one piece closer
to finally being completed.</i>

41:11.375 --> 41:15.583
<i>But as they continue
to dig all across the island,</i>

41:15.708 --> 41:17.917
<i>could it lead to a discovery</i>

41:18.042 --> 41:19.667
<i>that will merely change
their lives?</i>

41:19.792 --> 41:23.458
<i>Or will what
they ultimately find rewrite</i>

41:23.583 --> 41:26.958
<i>North American history?</i>

41:27.542 --> 41:30.375
<i>Next time
on</i> The Curse of Oak Island...

41:30.500 --> 41:32.125
-We've never seen that before.
-No.

41:32.208 --> 41:33.458
Oh, wow, look at this.

41:33.542 --> 41:34.458
It's looking like some sort

41:34.542 --> 41:36.000
of fairly large feature.

41:36.083 --> 41:38.292
This could be important
for the whole story.

41:38.375 --> 41:41.000
This object
is from medieval Europe.

41:41.125 --> 41:43.792
Wow. This adds validity
to Zena's map.

41:43.917 --> 41:46.917
<i>RICK:
We're trying to track the gold
back to its source.</i>

41:47.042 --> 41:49.958
IAN:
The area in pink there
would be exactly where

41:50.042 --> 41:52.458
-the gold is.
<i>-Wow. That is astounding.</i>

41:52.583 --> 41:55.667
-Yeah.
<i>-Let's go!</i>
