Waves

00:47.447 --> 00:50.491
What do you carry to me?

00:50.492 --> 00:54.961
Where will you carry me to?

01:09.511 --> 01:15.648
Children building castles
in the sand in my town

01:16.351 --> 01:18.568
Children

01:25.402 --> 01:27.827
A band's playing

01:27.946 --> 01:33.200
A band's playing
tomorrow night in my town

01:33.201 --> 01:37.420
They're called the... the Soron...

01:39.541 --> 01:42.835
Ladies have babies

01:42.836 --> 01:46.137
That's how it works

01:47.257 --> 01:51.510
Lady in the red coat,
what are you doing with that bag?

01:51.511 --> 01:56.439
Lady in the blue coat, do you
know the lady in the red coat?

02:07.861 --> 02:10.078
Slowly!

02:15.702 --> 02:26.594
Little boxes

02:28.465 --> 02:32.016
Take me away

02:33.011 --> 02:36.646
From these little boxes

02:38.308 --> 02:41.810
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Oh. Hi.

02:41.811 --> 02:44.063
Just in time. I made a casserole.

02:44.064 --> 02:45.939
No, thanks. I've got
an idea for a song.

02:45.940 --> 02:47.316
How was work?

02:47.317 --> 02:50.152
It was good. I've just...
before I forget it.

02:50.153 --> 02:55.365
OK, idea for a song in A minor.
Possible title, "Suburbia".

02:55.366 --> 03:00.412
I dream of an angel

03:00.413 --> 03:02.122
Down to E in the bass.

03:02.123 --> 03:08.003
To take me away

03:08.004 --> 03:09.254
To G.

03:09.255 --> 03:12.758
Take me away

03:12.759 --> 03:14.843
C.

03:14.844 --> 03:18.847
From these little boxes

03:18.848 --> 03:20.015
Back to A.

03:20.016 --> 03:23.977
I dream of an angel

03:23.978 --> 03:25.187
Up there.

03:25.188 --> 03:28.148
To take me away

03:28.149 --> 03:29.358
Oh, fuck!

03:29.859 --> 03:31.735
That's Madness.

03:31.736 --> 03:34.579
Fucking Madness song.

04:26.791 --> 04:31.010
Er... But not Johnston or Harman.

04:37.051 --> 04:41.597
'So how would you describe the...
how would you describe your music?'

04:41.598 --> 04:43.640
'Thank you for your
enquiry, Anthony.'

04:43.641 --> 04:45.809
'That's a fucking boring question.

04:45.810 --> 04:49.938
'I would describe our
sound as fucking happy.'

04:49.939 --> 04:52.065
- Let him speak!
- Fuck you!

04:52.066 --> 04:55.410
Cheese and ham panini. There you go.

04:55.653 --> 04:58.488
'Cheese and ham panini.

04:58.489 --> 05:01.450
'Hashtag livin' the dream.'

05:05.580 --> 05:08.047
'Yeah, that's him.'

05:08.875 --> 05:10.083
'Hello, sir.

05:10.084 --> 05:12.669
'Talk to you over here, sir.'

05:12.670 --> 05:14.880
'Look what you've made me become!'

05:14.881 --> 05:21.561
I'm gonna do it! I mean it!
This is your fault! This is all on you!

05:22.055 --> 05:23.764
Get out of the water.

05:23.765 --> 05:28.268
We were at this radio station.
He and Clara had a disagreement.

05:28.269 --> 05:33.489
Or... I don't know,
I guess a physical fight.

05:35.902 --> 05:39.579
You're the S...
You're playing tonight.

05:39.781 --> 05:44.417
How? Our keyboardist is
trying to drown himself.

05:45.620 --> 05:47.712
I play keyboards.

05:48.873 --> 05:53.092
She's wanted this from the start!

05:54.504 --> 05:58.723
No, no. I wasn't... that wasn't a...

06:01.552 --> 06:04.604
Red hair. OK.

06:08.476 --> 06:11.027
You play C, F and G?

06:11.938 --> 06:14.864
- Yeah.
- You're in.

06:15.566 --> 06:17.617
Really?

06:19.195 --> 06:22.948
So what shall we do now?
Shall we run through the songs?

06:22.949 --> 06:25.458
Stage door, 9:00pm tonight.

06:26.369 --> 06:29.337
OK. Let me give you my number.

06:37.672 --> 06:41.182
- Is he gonna be OK?
- He'll be fine.

06:42.176 --> 06:45.512
He'll still need to spend the
night in hospital, though?

06:45.513 --> 06:50.233
He's swallowed a lot of sea water.
He'll have to have his stomach pumped.

07:03.197 --> 07:04.448
Hello?

08:18.940 --> 08:21.157
In the soup

08:22.110 --> 08:24.660
Ginger crouton

08:26.072 --> 08:28.623
Cover him in grease

08:29.492 --> 08:33.461
Raw limby sausage

08:38.000 --> 08:40.885
Bobbing poulet

08:41.629 --> 08:44.764
Salted joints

08:46.634 --> 08:49.185
Tuna in brine

08:51.764 --> 08:55.358
Deep dark swell anoints

08:56.936 --> 09:02.281
Undertow the broken Ford
Back to garage help him, Lord

09:07.071 --> 09:11.199
Eels are jellied, bloated belly
Scallops seared, wrinkled skin

09:11.200 --> 09:15.871
Comb the cockles from his
beard Notify the next of kin

09:15.872 --> 09:18.290
Push the baby, cut the cord

09:18.291 --> 09:21.467
Spread the feast upon the board

09:26.507 --> 09:30.017
Coming out, emerging

09:30.761 --> 09:33.138
What happened?
You just stopped playing.

09:33.139 --> 09:36.124
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You stopped playing?

09:37.725 --> 09:39.819
Bullshit!

09:41.814 --> 09:45.157
This is just bullshit!
Fucking bullshit!

10:06.255 --> 10:08.347
It's OK, come on.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.900
Start up the car.

11:10.528 --> 11:11.820
Hello?

11:11.821 --> 11:15.615
'Lucas has been sectioned and
we need a new keyboard player.

11:15.616 --> 11:18.243
'Frank said, "Remember
that grateful-looking boy

11:18.244 --> 11:21.212
who jumped on stage
last week uninvited?"'

11:21.247 --> 11:23.123
I wasn't uninvited.

11:23.124 --> 11:27.043
'Frank said he thought you brought
something cherishable that night.

11:27.044 --> 11:29.713
'But he can sound really
muffled under the head,

11:29.714 --> 11:34.301
'so I thought he said you
brought something perishable.

11:34.302 --> 11:38.138
'You know, like food that
decays easily. Like fish or fruit.'

11:39.515 --> 11:42.559
'So I said, "Come on, man,
anybody can do that."

11:42.560 --> 11:47.655
'So anyways, we're doing this really
major thing over in Ireland. You in?'

11:48.065 --> 11:49.482
Yes.

11:49.483 --> 11:52.910
'Clacket Lane Services,
M25, 5:00pm today.'

11:53.362 --> 11:58.290
'You would not believe what's
happening to me right now.

11:59.493 --> 12:02.545
'Hashtag through the looking glass.'

12:05.207 --> 12:07.049
Hello.

12:07.084 --> 12:11.212
I wasn't sure where to wait. Clacket
Lane's pretty labyrinthine, isn't it?

12:11.213 --> 12:14.090
I was gonna stand by the
Bank of Scotland Cashline.

12:14.091 --> 12:16.259
Next to the RAC
membership stall there.

12:16.260 --> 12:19.346
But, er, I thought I'd be
more visible on the approach.

12:19.347 --> 12:23.983
So I just decided to come
straight... Hello. Oh.

12:24.143 --> 12:28.988
- Frank, scoot over.
- Hi, everybody.

12:30.066 --> 12:33.193
I was just saying to Don that
I didn't know where to stand,

12:33.194 --> 12:36.954
cos I thought that you might
not see me, so, erm...

12:58.803 --> 13:00.929
- I have a certificate.
- This way.

13:00.930 --> 13:04.391
It's an official medical
document. Certificate.

13:04.392 --> 13:06.976
You'll note the official stamp.

13:06.977 --> 13:10.070
It's all legal and above board.

13:11.524 --> 13:15.618
So, what do you think of Frank?

13:16.237 --> 13:17.529
Light me.

13:17.530 --> 13:20.448
- Erm...
- Fucking amazing, isn't he?

13:20.449 --> 13:22.200
Frank, you're on fire.

13:22.201 --> 13:26.246
He lives all the way out there,
man. In the furthest corners.

13:26.247 --> 13:29.089
Fuck, I wanna be Frank.

13:29.583 --> 13:32.343
- Don.
- Yeah?

13:33.045 --> 13:35.255
- The head.
- Smells like sausages.

13:35.256 --> 13:36.965
He never takes it off.

13:36.966 --> 13:39.759
- Never?
- No, never.

13:39.760 --> 13:42.262
- He sleeps in it?
- Yep.

13:42.263 --> 13:43.596
What about eating?

13:43.597 --> 13:47.809
He sucks liquid food through a straw
that he funnels up under the neckline.

13:47.810 --> 13:50.520
Occasionally solids,
but it's not encouraged.

13:50.521 --> 13:54.482
- What kind of liquid food?
- Grownut. It's like a supplement.

13:54.483 --> 13:58.278
- He must have a very bushy beard.
- Not necessarily.

13:58.279 --> 14:00.196
How does he clean his teeth?

14:00.197 --> 14:03.958
Look, Jon, you're just gonna
have to go with this.

14:04.034 --> 14:05.876
OK.

14:06.537 --> 14:09.664
Sorry, it's just...
it's pretty crazy, isn't it?

14:09.665 --> 14:12.800
I know, I know. I understand.

14:13.294 --> 14:15.462
But let me tell you something.

14:15.463 --> 14:18.965
Frank, with all his issues,
is without a doubt

14:18.966 --> 14:22.851
the most 100-percent
sanest cat I've ever met.

14:24.138 --> 14:27.140
- OK.
- Me, on the other hand...

14:30.102 --> 14:33.354
- You seem pretty sane to me.
- Yeah.

14:35.900 --> 14:41.154
But, no, no, I spent a lot of
time in a psychiatric hospital.

14:41.155 --> 14:44.574
I was labelled as
severely mentally ill.

14:44.575 --> 14:47.209
I used to fuck mannequins.

14:49.330 --> 14:51.331
- Right.
- It's a condition.

14:52.833 --> 14:55.050
Here we go.

14:56.504 --> 15:00.264
'Welcome to Ireland.
Remember to drive on the left.'

15:16.899 --> 15:20.117
Wakey-wakey, eggs and bakey.

15:29.078 --> 15:31.086
And everybody out.

15:40.497 --> 15:43.415
Welcome to Vetno.

15:43.884 --> 15:46.185
Our new home.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.520
Don?

15:49.265 --> 15:51.224
- Don!
- Alright.

15:55.020 --> 15:58.231
- You like?
- Impulse response.

15:58.232 --> 16:00.400
- OK, people.
- Excuse me.

16:00.401 --> 16:02.193
How long will we be
staying here for?

16:02.194 --> 16:05.238
Rhythm section shall be
housed in here. Ah, bunks.

16:06.239 --> 16:07.581
It is.

16:08.826 --> 16:11.953
Frank. The master bedroom for you.

16:11.954 --> 16:14.956
Had it customised for
all your requirements.

16:16.333 --> 16:18.418
These are the bathing
accommodations.

16:18.419 --> 16:20.461
We'll have productive seasons here.

16:20.462 --> 16:23.715
- And, Clara, your living quarters.
- Don!

16:23.716 --> 16:26.676
Nice panoramic view
of the lake here.

16:26.677 --> 16:30.270
And, Jon, you and I are
just through here.

16:35.477 --> 16:36.769
- Don.
- Yeah, buddy?

16:36.770 --> 16:40.940
Don. Sorry. I actually told work
that I'd be back on Monday.

16:40.941 --> 16:44.152
- So I was just wondering...
- Why the fuck would you do that?

16:44.153 --> 16:46.070
I thought it was just a gig,

16:46.071 --> 16:48.948
so I've only brought one
pair of pants and a T-shirt.

16:48.949 --> 16:51.701
I'll be staying right here
in the green trailer.

16:51.702 --> 16:56.205
So if you need anything at
night, you know, sugar, milk,

16:56.206 --> 16:58.249
if you freak out,

16:58.250 --> 17:00.300
you just come a-knocking.

17:05.883 --> 17:08.183
Well, come on, chop chop.

17:11.972 --> 17:15.232
- That's alpine cedar. Nice.
- Don.

17:15.643 --> 17:18.853
- Yeah?
- How long are we staying here?

17:18.854 --> 17:22.406
Just as long as it takes
to record the album, Jon.

17:54.890 --> 17:57.684
'Vetno, Ireland.

17:57.685 --> 18:01.938
'After several days of what
Frank calls fieldwork,

18:01.939 --> 18:05.574
'rehearsals proper have begun.'

18:12.324 --> 18:15.250
'I'm settling into my new life

18:15.369 --> 18:18.246
'and gradually getting to know
my fellow band members.'

18:18.247 --> 18:20.957
Wow, this is beautiful.
What do you call it?

18:22.710 --> 18:24.752
Stay away from my fucking Theremin.

18:24.753 --> 18:27.922
'A few teething problems,
as you would expect,

18:27.923 --> 18:30.967
'but beginning to feel
like one of the gang.'

18:30.968 --> 18:36.355
So... I do not know why Frank
asked you to join the group...

18:36.473 --> 18:39.274
but I'm not at all convinced.

18:39.351 --> 18:40.643
You disgust me.

18:46.233 --> 18:51.070
'At Vetno, there's already a
palpable sense of free expression

18:51.071 --> 18:54.699
'and I can't wait to dive
into the creative maelstrom.'

18:54.700 --> 18:58.578
OK, everybody. Next time
round go to G minor. OK?

18:58.579 --> 19:00.580
One, two, three, four.

19:00.581 --> 19:03.583
Fucking major. Major!

19:03.584 --> 19:08.428
'But of course, I shall have
to earn my place in the band.

'At the heart of it all is Frank.

19:13.844 --> 19:16.937
'How to describe Frank?

19:17.014 --> 19:22.602
'Mostly he seems friendly.
Though sometimes a little intense.'

19:22.603 --> 19:24.604
- It'll be worth it!
- Stop, Frank!

19:24.605 --> 19:26.405
It'll be worth it!

19:26.648 --> 19:30.735
'He can hide himself
away for days at a time.

'What goes on inside that head...
inside that head?'

19:36.450 --> 19:40.586
Yes, it's like an aviary.

19:41.163 --> 19:44.256
You're birds. Baraque.

19:44.750 --> 19:46.626
You're a cormorant.

19:46.627 --> 19:49.553
Nana, moorhen.

19:49.922 --> 19:55.601
Clara, the owl. Night hunter.
Silent killer.

19:56.804 --> 19:59.104
What have we got here?

19:59.431 --> 20:04.151
Lay an egg for me, little
ginger bird. Lay an egg.

20:04.895 --> 20:08.940
'Frank says he must push
us to our furthest corners

20:08.941 --> 20:12.193
'and unlock the great
music that hides there.'

20:12.194 --> 20:14.028
Squat.

20:14.029 --> 20:18.032
Go on, lay an egg. Get that egg out.
Squeeze that egg out.

20:18.033 --> 20:20.993
'It can feel a little
overwhelming at times.'

20:22.287 --> 20:26.999
'But all in all, I am happy
to be a part of this.'

20:29.545 --> 20:32.137
'Just happy.'

20:41.682 --> 20:44.892
- I don't wanna be me!
- Go back inside! Please.

20:44.893 --> 20:50.364
I don't wanna be me! Frank,
just let me go! I don't wanna live!

20:50.440 --> 20:55.243
Don't let him get to the lake!
Don't let him get to the lake!

20:55.445 --> 20:58.205
I'm free!

20:58.282 --> 21:00.950
- I'm free!
- Wait, Don.

21:00.951 --> 21:05.379
- Oh.
- Don, don't get up.

21:46.371 --> 21:49.673
Did he tell you about
the mannequins?

21:50.584 --> 21:52.467
Yeah.

21:54.504 --> 21:57.097
I met one once.

21:57.758 --> 22:00.392
Caroline Cuntley.

22:03.138 --> 22:07.065
- I'm Frank.
- I'm Jon.

22:15.442 --> 22:19.195
- Does he still...?
- No.

22:19.196 --> 22:23.950
He has relationships with real women
now. But it's hard, you know.

22:23.951 --> 22:28.079
He has to convince them to lie
completely still, so, you know.

22:28.080 --> 22:31.707
Hey, don't tell Don I said anything.

22:31.708 --> 22:34.794
- No.
- He might think it a shameful secret.

22:34.795 --> 22:40.348
I say tell everyone everything.
Why cover anything up? Right?

22:41.760 --> 22:45.812
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

22:46.431 --> 22:48.440
Why do you wear that?

22:49.142 --> 22:52.687
- You think it's weird?
- Kinda.

22:52.688 --> 22:57.400
Well, normal faces are
weird too, you know.

22:57.401 --> 23:03.823
The way they're...
smooth, smooth, smooth.

23:03.824 --> 23:08.160
And then, blah, you know...
all bumpy and holes.

23:08.161 --> 23:11.247
And what are eyes like?
Like a science-fiction movie.

23:11.248 --> 23:15.835
Don't get me started on lips. Like
the edges of a very serious wound.

23:15.836 --> 23:20.506
That's true. But your head
is still sort of intimidating.

23:20.507 --> 23:23.767
Well, underneath I'm giving
you a welcoming smile.

23:24.428 --> 23:27.763
Would it help if I said my
facial expressions out loud?

23:27.764 --> 23:31.233
- Well, maybe.
- Welcoming smile.

23:31.685 --> 23:33.527
Frank.

23:35.439 --> 23:38.983
You've been up all night talking
to the keyboard player?

23:38.984 --> 23:42.862
I'm not just a keyboard player.
I write songs, too.

23:42.863 --> 23:45.990
- You write your own songs?
- Hm-hmm.

23:45.991 --> 23:47.825
I'd love to play some
for you sometime.

23:47.826 --> 23:51.746
I'd really like that.
Big non-threatening grin.

23:51.747 --> 23:53.247
Delighted look.

23:53.248 --> 23:54.999
You're funny.

23:55.000 --> 23:58.552
- Play one now.
- Excellent.

23:59.588 --> 24:02.089
- Not right now. I'm OK.
- No, no.

24:02.090 --> 24:04.842
- I'd love to hear one of your songs.
- I would, too. Go on.

24:04.843 --> 24:07.845
- I don't think so.
- Please.

24:07.846 --> 24:11.182
Hey, guys. Jon,
he writes his own music.

24:11.183 --> 24:14.018
- He's gonna play some for us.
- I...

24:14.019 --> 24:15.436
- Come on.
- Clara.

24:15.437 --> 24:19.030
Share your music with us, Jon.

24:20.692 --> 24:22.735
- Erm...
- Play something!

24:22.736 --> 24:23.944
OK.

24:25.364 --> 24:28.331
I haven't warmed up my hands.

24:29.284 --> 24:32.870
Erm... OK. Erm... er...

24:34.748 --> 24:38.049
That's just...
That's a warm-up. Erm...

24:39.044 --> 24:42.512
I've got one.
I've got one that's like...

24:43.298 --> 24:46.634
I was walking down
the street one day

24:46.635 --> 24:49.178
Thinking about the lady I love

24:49.179 --> 24:53.732
When a guy comes down
and says, "What do you do?"

24:55.394 --> 24:57.144
That's... I haven't finished..

24:57.145 --> 24:58.687
That's shit.

24:58.688 --> 25:00.731
I've got a kind of a rocky one.

25:00.732 --> 25:02.149
La... La...

25:02.150 --> 25:05.694
Lady in the red coat,
what are you doing with that bag?

25:05.695 --> 25:06.987
I've only...

25:06.988 --> 25:09.281
Fuck. You know when
you've got so many songs

25:09.282 --> 25:11.242
and none of them will come out?

25:11.243 --> 25:15.079
Oh, no, I've got one. I've got one.
There's one which is like...

25:23.296 --> 25:25.205
That's yours.

25:25.306 --> 25:26.615
Don.

25:27.016 --> 25:28.467
Hey, buddy.

25:28.468 --> 25:30.094
Oh, man.

25:30.095 --> 25:33.939
- How are you feeling?
- Better.

25:34.933 --> 25:37.977
He's gonna need a chiropractor.

25:54.536 --> 25:57.045
You bummed out?

25:58.540 --> 26:00.966
- A little bit.
- Why?

26:01.793 --> 26:05.178
I don't think I've ever
been able to find my...

26:06.006 --> 26:11.343
core song-writing themes. You know?

26:11.344 --> 26:13.637
You can write a song about anything.

26:13.638 --> 26:15.981
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

26:17.601 --> 26:21.653
Hey! Like your socks here.

26:22.689 --> 26:25.323
They're pretty original.

26:25.901 --> 26:27.826
Hey, look at this.

26:28.069 --> 26:30.912
This little tuft in the carpet.

26:31.114 --> 26:34.241
I wonder how old he
is in carpet years.

26:34.242 --> 26:40.005
Is it spring and he's the
first to wake, or...

26:40.665 --> 26:45.427
is he old... but still
strong enough...

26:45.670 --> 26:48.555
to keep what winter wants to take?

26:48.965 --> 26:54.686
Lone standing tuft

26:55.889 --> 27:00.442
Defies the foot

27:01.478 --> 27:05.189
Is it luck that
you're still standing?

27:05.190 --> 27:08.108
You've not been flattened too

27:08.109 --> 27:11.695
Do you tremble beneath
the gentle breeze

27:11.696 --> 27:15.157
That's displaced by my shoe?

27:15.158 --> 27:20.211
Lone standing tuft

27:21.081 --> 27:25.884
- Silly.
- Frank, that's amazing.

27:25.919 --> 27:29.797
Flattered grin, followed
by a bashful half-smile.

27:29.798 --> 27:34.768
No. People should know about you.
You should be famous.

27:35.804 --> 27:38.104
You understand.

27:38.848 --> 27:40.140
I understand what?

27:40.141 --> 27:43.811
Understand there are people out
there that might like our music.

27:43.812 --> 27:49.157
Sometimes I think Clara doesn't
care if people like us or not.

27:50.026 --> 27:53.787
- Really?
- It's weird.

27:54.614 --> 27:56.581
It's really weird.

28:25.687 --> 28:28.314
- What is this?
- Potato.

28:28.315 --> 28:31.032
And what is this?

28:31.151 --> 28:33.576
Stew.

28:33.653 --> 28:35.738
You should go home.

28:35.739 --> 28:39.958
Frank picked me. OK?
So it's not up to you.

28:40.327 --> 28:44.121
- Excuse me?
- He said I was cherishable.

28:44.122 --> 28:45.831
And he picked me to join the band.

28:45.832 --> 28:49.668
You are fingers being
told which keys to push.

28:49.669 --> 28:55.299
- I push my own keys.
- Ten little bits of bone and skin.

28:55.300 --> 29:00.512
I'm perfectly capable of going to
my furthest corners and composing.

29:00.513 --> 29:03.766
- Your furthest corners?
- My furthest corners.

29:03.767 --> 29:06.234
Someone needs to punch
you in the face.

29:09.356 --> 29:14.276
Lips pursed together as if
to say, "Enough frivolity."

29:14.277 --> 29:18.030
Today we begin work on
the album in earnest.

29:18.031 --> 29:21.742
'Frank wants us to start
everything from scratch.'

29:21.743 --> 29:23.285
Note the colour-coding.

29:23.286 --> 29:26.955
'He's created an entirely new
musical notation system.'

29:26.956 --> 29:29.291
'...like creamy little galaxies.'

29:29.292 --> 29:32.461
'We've designed our
own instruments.'

29:38.718 --> 29:44.564
'He has initiated a strict
regime of physical exercise.'

29:45.100 --> 29:46.225
Oh, for fuck's sake!

29:46.226 --> 29:49.937
'Fortunately, we have a safe word
for when things get too intense.'

29:49.938 --> 29:51.438
Chinchilla!

29:51.439 --> 29:53.190
'Chinchilla.'

29:53.191 --> 29:55.074
Chinchilla! Chinchilla!

29:55.819 --> 30:00.364
'It's incredible. Frank finds
inspiration in everything.'

30:00.365 --> 30:01.824
I find this inspiring.

30:01.825 --> 30:04.118
'How does he do this?

30:04.119 --> 30:08.789
'If I'm to grow as an artist,
I must see as he sees.'

30:08.790 --> 30:11.125
We could make an album
out of this one sound.

30:11.126 --> 30:14.420
'I dedicate myself to
learning his secret

30:14.421 --> 30:19.299
'and I will not let anybody get in my way,
however desperately they may try.'

30:19.300 --> 30:21.510
Somebody's thinking in the key of C.

30:21.511 --> 30:23.762
Oh, it's me! It's me!

30:23.763 --> 30:26.265
Oh, fuck! Chinchilla!

30:26.266 --> 30:28.350
Keep going! Keep going!

30:28.351 --> 30:31.520
'I am more convinced than
ever that this band,

30:31.521 --> 30:36.817
'whether they realise it or not,
could achieve greatness.

30:36.818 --> 30:41.613
'And I will work to take my
place at its very heart.

30:41.614 --> 30:45.917
'I will show them
what I am capable of.

30:46.244 --> 30:48.503
'I will show them.'

30:58.882 --> 31:02.551
- Hey.
- Psst. Hey, man, what are you doing?

31:02.552 --> 31:05.512
- I'm composing a song.
- Right.

31:05.513 --> 31:09.941
Ooh, ah-ooh

31:13.229 --> 31:17.191
- Yeah, man. I know.
- What?

31:17.192 --> 31:21.320
I know what it feels like to try and
write a song and it just comes out shit.

31:21.321 --> 31:24.539
Here, let me hop in the saddle.

31:26.618 --> 31:31.462
Here's a little love song I wrote
a long, long, long time ago.

31:37.170 --> 31:44.851
The stillness of the winter night

31:46.221 --> 31:54.068
The frozen water's icy skin

31:54.354 --> 32:02.160
Is broken by the boatman's oar

32:03.404 --> 32:10.168
Be still and let me in

32:11.287 --> 32:19.052
Oh, let me in

32:19.420 --> 32:24.098
But stay still

32:26.010 --> 32:29.228
There, see? Shit, too.

32:29.639 --> 32:34.226
But look, Jon, sooner or later
you're gonna get the feeling,

32:34.227 --> 32:36.395
"Why can't I be Frank?"

32:36.396 --> 32:40.198
Or "Maybe I can be Frank."

32:40.650 --> 32:46.412
Jon, there can only be one Frank.
One.

32:46.573 --> 32:51.834
Actually, Don, I think both
our songs were excellent.

32:52.412 --> 32:56.798
Yeah. Right? Come on,
let's go for a walk.

32:57.584 --> 32:59.793
Yeah, I've known Frank was special

32:59.794 --> 33:02.004
since the moment I first saw him.

33:02.005 --> 33:05.048
This nurse was trying to
wrestle his head off.

33:05.049 --> 33:07.926
I mean, the guy must
have weighed 300 pounds.

33:07.927 --> 33:11.013
Frank was freaking out so
hard he just backed off.

33:11.014 --> 33:14.190
- A mental hospital?
- Hmm.

33:16.769 --> 33:20.063
Have you ever seen
him without the head?

33:20.064 --> 33:22.365
God, no.

33:22.942 --> 33:25.910
Maybe he's facially disfigured.

33:26.195 --> 33:30.623
Forced to wear a mask
like the Elephant Man.

33:31.534 --> 33:36.413
Hmm. All I know is that he told
me once he was from Kansas.

33:36.414 --> 33:40.800
- Bluff, Kansas.
- Bluff, Kansas. Sounds dark.

33:42.337 --> 33:44.429
Jacuzzi?

33:44.505 --> 33:48.433
No. Get back to work.

33:49.886 --> 33:52.387
Miserable childhood. Mental illness.

33:52.388 --> 33:54.789
Where do I find that
kind of inspiration?

33:55.016 --> 33:58.101
'Congratulations.
You've made the first step

33:58.102 --> 34:00.187
'towards releasing your creativity

34:00.188 --> 34:03.565
'in a way that will change
every aspect of your life.

34:03.566 --> 34:06.026
'Take everyday
activities like shaving.

34:06.027 --> 34:08.277
'As Edward de Bono once said,

34:08.279 --> 34:11.322
'how often does someone,
using a traditional wet razor,

34:11.324 --> 34:15.494
'stop to consider whether
instead of moving the razor,

34:15.495 --> 34:22.382
'it might be easier to keep the razor
still and simply move the face?'

34:34.514 --> 34:35.931
What is that?

34:35.931 --> 34:38.934
I think it's called
The Idiot Shriek.

34:38.935 --> 34:41.360
It's beautiful.

34:41.813 --> 34:44.438
- Such pain.
- Hey.

34:44.440 --> 34:46.824
- Such emptiness.
- Hey!

34:54.742 --> 34:57.585
Someone's at the door.

35:02.875 --> 35:05.009
What?

35:05.695 --> 35:08.431
Easy, Don.

35:09.132 --> 35:12.642
Start again. From the beginning.

35:12.677 --> 35:14.177
Patient smile.

35:14.178 --> 35:17.597
Stop saying your facial expressions.
It's extremely annoying.

35:17.598 --> 35:20.726
- Sorry.
- We've run out of time.

35:20.727 --> 35:22.686
We've spent all of our rent money

35:22.687 --> 35:27.448
and the landlord gave us
30 days' notice to leave.

35:27.817 --> 35:30.110
And we didn't leave.

35:30.111 --> 35:34.705
So now they've rented Vetno
to a family of holidaymakers...

35:35.074 --> 35:38.709
who are right over there.

35:39.120 --> 35:42.831
- Why didn't you tell us?
- I didn't wanna disappoint you.

35:42.832 --> 35:45.125
We haven't recorded a note.

35:45.126 --> 35:47.627
- I know.
- I can pay.

35:47.628 --> 35:48.795
What?

35:48.796 --> 35:52.299
When my grandfather died,
I inherited money.

35:52.300 --> 35:54.468
He said it was my nest egg.

35:54.469 --> 35:59.438
He said I should only ever spend my
nest egg on something really important.

36:00.141 --> 36:01.725
I want you guys to have my nest egg.

36:01.726 --> 36:05.361
- Oh, Jon.
- Thank you.

36:06.606 --> 36:09.107
Oh, ginger bird.

36:09.108 --> 36:11.610
It'll buy us enough time
to make the album.

36:11.611 --> 36:15.489
What are you doing
in our holiday home?

36:15.490 --> 36:18.033
What are you saying to each other?

36:18.034 --> 36:20.960
Shit. What do we do about them?

36:21.245 --> 36:25.332
I'm terribly sorry to
inconvenience you.

36:25.333 --> 36:30.636
Come. Let us walk together outside.

37:07.083 --> 37:09.042
Bye. Thank you.

37:09.043 --> 37:11.711
Thank you for this new
truth in my soul.

37:19.011 --> 37:22.396
Fucking crazy lady.

37:28.980 --> 37:33.115
'It's been a long time since
I've written anything.

37:33.442 --> 37:39.281
'We've been working on the new
music for 14 hours a day for...

37:39.282 --> 37:42.041
'...11 months now.

37:45.496 --> 37:47.747
'It has not been easy.'

37:47.748 --> 37:52.043
Again.

37:52.044 --> 37:55.088
'None of us has left Vetno
since we got here.'

37:55.089 --> 37:57.007
Again.

37:57.008 --> 38:00.093
'Frank refuses to record the album

38:00.094 --> 38:04.431
'until we have perfected
each and every detail.

38:04.432 --> 38:07.274
- 'He can be pitiless.'
- Again!

38:09.687 --> 38:11.612
Merge!

38:12.857 --> 38:18.744
'My nest egg has been depleted
a lot more than I anticipated.

38:19.113 --> 38:22.748
'We've had to start
rationing the food.'

38:24.285 --> 38:26.585
Fuck off.

38:31.751 --> 38:35.420
'And on top of all this,
Clara's hatred of me...'

38:35.421 --> 38:36.588
Thief!

38:36.589 --> 38:40.175
'...remains as strong and
as baffling as ever.'

38:40.176 --> 38:43.637
- I want it back.
- Those are my keyboard-playing fingers.

38:43.638 --> 38:48.183
'I'll admit there have been times
when I've considered leaving Vetno.

38:48.184 --> 38:50.560
'But I'm still here.

38:50.561 --> 38:53.313
'And I am glad when I
see how many of you

38:53.314 --> 38:56.574
'continue to join
me on this journey.

38:56.609 --> 38:59.444
'You know, despite all the
hardships I've suffered here...'

38:59.445 --> 39:00.946
Just took a shit.

39:00.947 --> 39:05.750
'...something inside me
is beginning to stir.

39:05.910 --> 39:10.997
'I've come to realise that
this is my Bluff, Kansas.

39:10.998 --> 39:16.461
'That here in Vetno I have
found my abusive childhood.

39:16.462 --> 39:19.513
'My mental hospital.

39:19.590 --> 39:21.800
'That which pushes me...'

39:21.801 --> 39:23.093
Oh, God.

39:23.094 --> 39:24.803
'...to my furthest corners.'

39:24.804 --> 39:26.513
This is really good.

39:26.514 --> 39:28.765
Frank. Frank, I've...

39:41.862 --> 39:43.822
Get right in there.

39:43.823 --> 39:49.418
Dog-leg left, 527 yards to
the centre of the green.

39:49.787 --> 39:52.546
Nobody hits a ball like that.

39:54.166 --> 39:56.217
Get in the hole!

39:56.961 --> 39:59.428
You're the man.

40:00.214 --> 40:02.640
Oh! Oh.

40:05.219 --> 40:06.928
I've written a song.

40:11.600 --> 40:13.692
And goes up.

40:17.398 --> 40:19.159
Yeah.

40:28.451 --> 40:31.919
- Amazing.
- Really?

40:32.121 --> 40:33.872
- Yeah.
- You really think so?

40:33.873 --> 40:37.292
That means the world to me.
Thank you so much.

40:37.293 --> 40:38.793
- Do you mind?
- Please.

40:38.794 --> 40:40.128
OK, so...

40:40.729 --> 40:43.289
Pare that down.

40:43.883 --> 40:45.133
Now go up a half.

40:48.387 --> 40:49.554
Go up a whole.

40:51.390 --> 40:53.433
- Hmm.
- Now go back down.

40:53.434 --> 40:55.901
Oh, I see, yeah.

40:58.481 --> 41:00.489
That's fantastic.

41:01.734 --> 41:02.776
Uh-huh.

41:02.777 --> 41:04.569
- That's excellent.
- Here.

41:06.781 --> 41:08.031
Uh-huh.

41:08.032 --> 41:09.824
- Right?
- Right.

41:09.825 --> 41:13.161
- What were you playing before?
- That was like an F.

41:13.162 --> 41:16.046
You play F there, that'd be shit.

41:16.582 --> 41:19.717
Yeah. Let's make that
stomp a bit more.

42:12.930 --> 42:14.597
Through the portals

42:14.598 --> 42:16.941
Vetno tapes. Take one.

42:18.894 --> 42:20.861
Comet tails

42:21.981 --> 42:26.158
Screeching frequencies
of pulsing infinities

42:27.611 --> 42:29.787
Awake in the hive

42:31.907 --> 42:35.918
Where the sap is collected
The process perfected

42:38.330 --> 42:40.881
The galactic siren sounds

42:45.921 --> 42:50.216
Down the dimensions of
curled-up strings inside the point

42:50.217 --> 42:55.180
Get out of the path
of the king, Mr Laurel

42:55.181 --> 42:58.941
Get out of the path
of the king, Mr Hardy

43:00.352 --> 43:04.439
Regret, get off out
the path of the king

43:04.440 --> 43:06.691
They will not be able to
attend tonight's dinner

43:06.692 --> 43:09.493
The supernova outshone!

43:13.866 --> 43:17.042
Get out of the path of the king

43:17.161 --> 43:19.044
Yeah!

43:20.456 --> 43:23.590
Saddle up

43:27.004 --> 43:31.015
Secure the galactic perimeters

43:33.302 --> 43:36.854
Weak and strong, nuclear bombs

43:49.693 --> 43:52.870
Stab it. Stab it. Stab it.

44:15.427 --> 44:23.734
Now what's together
will soon come apart

44:23.811 --> 44:27.981
When it's all over

44:27.982 --> 44:33.160
No back to the start

44:56.844 --> 44:59.019
Don?

45:01.807 --> 45:04.066
We're done.

46:33.565 --> 46:35.817
Frank.

46:35.818 --> 46:39.161
- Get the rope off!
- I don't know how!

47:57.191 --> 47:59.658
Bye, Don.

48:00.819 --> 48:04.496
You were the best keyboard
player we ever had.

48:04.531 --> 48:06.532
The best man I ever knew.

48:06.533 --> 48:09.501
Don used to be the keyboard player?

48:10.537 --> 48:14.089
First it was Don, then it was Lucas.

48:15.375 --> 48:17.718
Now it's you.

49:49.344 --> 49:52.896
Jon, what the fuck are you doing?

50:05.319 --> 50:07.661
'It's what Don would want.'

50:08.113 --> 50:11.532
So you've been posting
videos of us online?

50:11.533 --> 50:13.701
That's not the point.

50:13.702 --> 50:17.580
Because of those clips, we've been
offered a really fucking important gig.

50:17.581 --> 50:19.756
You've been spying on us.

50:20.083 --> 50:22.259
South by Southwest.

50:22.628 --> 50:26.088
In Texas. It's very prestigious.
They've got a New Discoveries strand.

50:26.089 --> 50:29.675
That's ridiculous. Come on, Frank.
Let's get you cleaned up.

50:29.676 --> 50:34.305
Why does it say 2-3-7-5-1
at the bottom?

50:34.306 --> 50:37.274
That's the number of people
who've watched the clip.

50:37.476 --> 50:41.987
2-3-7-5-1 people are
interested in us?

50:42.481 --> 50:44.448
Come on, Frank.

50:45.359 --> 50:50.120
- It's like magic.
- I told you we could be big.

50:50.822 --> 50:55.167
Can't see anything in this
fucking... fucking place.

50:56.036 --> 50:58.037
What game are you playing?

50:58.038 --> 51:00.247
Filling Frank's head with
these bullshit ideas.

51:00.248 --> 51:03.550
I can't hear you over the
sound of the bubbles.

51:04.419 --> 51:06.087
Fuck! How the fuck...

51:06.088 --> 51:08.631
You pressed full-bubble-strength.

51:08.632 --> 51:11.050
They're on a timer.
You've just restarted.

51:11.051 --> 51:12.510
Leave Frank alone.

51:12.511 --> 51:15.554
I know you want me to end
up like Don or Lucas,

51:15.555 --> 51:17.139
but that's not gonna be my role...

51:17.140 --> 51:19.809
You are a mediocre child.

51:19.810 --> 51:21.560
- Excuse me?
- An infection.

51:21.561 --> 51:24.855
- You keep him locked up like...
- Bindweed, chickweed...

51:24.856 --> 51:27.525
- You're like Josef...
- Absence. Absence.

51:27.526 --> 51:30.069
What's his fucking name?
Josef Fritzl!

51:30.070 --> 51:33.622
- Middle management!
- Cunt!

51:39.454 --> 51:42.332
Oh, fucking hell! Oh, fucking hell!

51:42.833 --> 51:46.043
Oh, God! Ow! Ow!

51:46.044 --> 51:49.262
Ow! Oh, fuck!

51:49.506 --> 51:51.556
I'm fucking dying...

51:57.597 --> 52:00.440
This is gonna be awkward.

52:00.726 --> 52:02.977
What is?

52:02.978 --> 52:06.988
Us. You know... together.

52:10.444 --> 52:12.953
We will never be together.

52:13.864 --> 52:17.332
- Oh.
- I find you...

52:17.868 --> 52:20.001
disgusting.

52:20.912 --> 52:22.955
Hmm.

52:22.956 --> 52:28.301
- Disgusting.
- Yeah, OK. I get the point.

52:30.380 --> 52:32.556
Clara...

52:33.258 --> 52:35.559
What does he look like?

52:36.803 --> 52:39.437
I don't know.

52:42.184 --> 52:44.852
Was it awful in the
mental hospital, Clara?

52:44.853 --> 52:48.606
- How should I know?
- I assumed you were mentally ill.

52:48.607 --> 52:50.691
- You did?
- Hm-hmm.

52:50.692 --> 52:51.901
Oh.

52:51.902 --> 52:54.612
So why are you so against
us finding an audience

52:54.613 --> 52:57.789
if it's not because
you're mentally ill?

53:01.286 --> 53:04.337
You're in love with Frank.

53:06.249 --> 53:10.628
You love him and you're scared that if
other people love him, you'll lose him.

53:10.629 --> 53:14.848
And one day I'll take off my
glasses and he'll really see me...

53:16.009 --> 53:21.521
and we'll do big kisses.
That's really how you think?

53:22.557 --> 53:26.227
Don't presume to
tell me how I think.

53:35.987 --> 53:41.249
If you fuck everything up
in America, I'll stab you.

53:53.171 --> 53:55.548
It's just like Paris,
Texas, isn't it?

53:55.549 --> 53:58.058
It's definitely...

53:58.718 --> 54:02.771
- What are you looking for?
- Don.

54:18.864 --> 54:20.789
Hey, Don.

54:22.826 --> 54:25.168
Hey, partner.

54:26.329 --> 54:28.706
I remember you saying
that the desert here

54:28.707 --> 54:32.084
was your favourite place
in the whole world.

54:32.085 --> 54:35.136
After Sea World, San Diego.

54:36.423 --> 54:39.015
I know you were homesick, Don.

54:39.217 --> 54:43.137
And I know there were times when
you wanted to come back here,

54:43.138 --> 54:45.814
but you didn't because of me.

54:48.768 --> 54:51.820
Well, you're home now, Don.

54:51.938 --> 54:56.533
I promise those sacrifices
you made won't be in vain.

54:57.360 --> 55:02.156
Jon has foretold of a night,
some nights from now,

55:02.157 --> 55:05.409
when, thanks to his secret camera,

55:05.410 --> 55:09.788
legions and multitudes
of already adoring fans

55:09.789 --> 55:15.719
shall gather and they shall
receive our music in rapture.

55:19.299 --> 55:21.766
It's Grownut.

55:22.761 --> 55:25.387
Frank, it's Grownut.

55:25.388 --> 55:28.148
Shit, shit...

55:31.019 --> 55:35.196
- I took the wrong box.
- Alright, Don.

55:35.398 --> 55:39.360
- Let's feed the desert with you anyway.
- Oh, Don.

55:39.361 --> 55:41.745
Fucking Grownut!

56:07.055 --> 56:10.190
- Looking good.
- Don't touch me.

56:10.475 --> 56:14.061
- Awesome costumes, guys.
- Thank you. Thank you.

56:14.062 --> 56:17.947
We're playing the Sunshine.
Day after tomorrow.

56:19.901 --> 56:21.785
Frank.

56:33.790 --> 56:35.582
Hello.

56:35.583 --> 56:38.544
Something tells me that you
guys are the Soronprfbs.

56:38.545 --> 56:40.421
- That's us.
- You're Jon?

56:40.422 --> 56:42.131
Yes. Hi.

56:42.132 --> 56:45.801
So, here are the festival passes
and an information pack.

56:45.802 --> 56:49.471
And did Simone pronounce
your name right?

56:49.472 --> 56:52.016
- Jon.
- No, the band's name.

56:52.017 --> 56:54.101
Oh, actually, I don't know.

56:54.102 --> 56:56.562
Clara, how do we pronounce
the band's name?

56:56.563 --> 57:00.357
- Ask him.
- Listen, are you guys hungry?

57:00.358 --> 57:01.567
Er, yeah.

57:01.568 --> 57:06.405
We were gonna go get something to eat.
It's the best pancake house in town.

57:06.406 --> 57:09.450
There's open mike.
It's gonna be awesome.

57:09.451 --> 57:10.909
Awesome. Awesome.

57:10.910 --> 57:14.455
I sit in Tracy's bedroom

57:14.456 --> 57:18.167
In my knee-socks
and Chelsea's beanie

57:18.168 --> 57:21.628
Talking boyfriends,
tongues and weenies

57:22.881 --> 57:25.174
You guys have been
in the forest, so long

57:25.175 --> 57:27.801
all this craziness has to
be kind of overwhelming.

57:27.802 --> 57:29.845
No, we're cool with that.

57:30.972 --> 57:35.400
I'm delighted to be launching
our album here. Delighted look.

57:35.894 --> 57:41.815
This is a most unique and exciting
opportunity you've given us

57:41.816 --> 57:46.153
to finally play in front of people
who actually know and love us.

57:46.154 --> 57:50.699
You know? Until now, our audiences
tend to be people who chance upon us

57:50.700 --> 57:53.994
and realise after a few
minutes they don't like us.

57:53.995 --> 57:54.995
Frank!

57:54.996 --> 57:56.997
I gotta tell you, we
know who you are.

57:56.998 --> 58:00.125
We found you, but the audience
won't have heard of you.

58:00.126 --> 58:02.461
They do not know and love us.

58:02.462 --> 58:05.339
But more than 23,700 people
watched us on YouTube.

58:05.340 --> 58:07.466
23,000 hits on YouTube is nothing.

58:07.467 --> 58:10.677
- They do not know us.
- Yeah, those kind of views...

58:10.678 --> 58:14.348
Maybe one or two people in the
room will know you. Maybe nobody.

58:14.349 --> 58:17.559
Half a million is when
you're onto something big.

58:17.560 --> 58:20.020
- We fucked it up.
- But they're cool, right?

58:20.021 --> 58:22.731
- I mean, they'll like us.
- They'll love you.

58:22.732 --> 58:26.326
Jon? Jon?

58:27.654 --> 58:32.366
'Recent revelations have raised
serious questions in the band

58:32.367 --> 58:36.787
'about the reception we can look
forward to at New Discoveries.'

58:36.788 --> 58:38.247
Lick my ass!

58:38.248 --> 58:41.542
'A hastily arranged warm-up
gig earlier this evening...'

58:41.543 --> 58:43.043
That was shit.

58:43.044 --> 58:45.337
'...did nothing to steady the ship.

58:45.338 --> 58:50.342
'Luckily, I am no longer
the man I was a year ago.

58:50.343 --> 58:54.479
'Now, in crisis, I see
creative possibility.

58:55.807 --> 58:58.851
'Turns out I may be
closer to the Zeitgeist

58:58.852 --> 59:02.187
'than certain people
gave me credit for.

59:02.188 --> 59:05.524
'I'm ready to make my
mark on this band.'

59:05.525 --> 59:08.360
So you want us to change our sound?

59:08.361 --> 59:10.237
We've always demanded

59:10.238 --> 59:13.991
the audience stretch their corners
all the way out to meet ours.

59:13.992 --> 59:16.793
But what if, Frank...

59:16.995 --> 59:21.248
What if we pull our corners
back a little bit?

59:21.249 --> 59:24.835
No, just a tiny, tiny bit. And
then everyone's corners can meet,

59:24.836 --> 59:28.005
you know, in a place that's
still a really long way off.

59:28.006 --> 59:30.591
But it's just a bit less...

59:32.592 --> 59:35.053
You know? And a bit more likable.

59:35.054 --> 59:39.023
- But not in a bad way.
- I'm not playing the fucking ukulele.

59:40.143 --> 59:42.402
Frank.

59:42.896 --> 59:46.398
I'm writing my most
likable song ever.

59:46.399 --> 59:48.317
I've always dreamed

59:48.318 --> 59:53.030
that one day I'd have a band
member who shared my vision

59:53.031 --> 59:55.616
of creating extremely likable music.

59:55.617 --> 01:00:01.038
So thank you, Jon. You gave
me the little push I needed.

01:00:01.039 --> 01:00:05.834
OK, enough chatter. Here it is.

01:00:05.835 --> 01:00:08.879
My most likable song ever.

01:00:12.258 --> 01:00:15.969
Coca Cola lipstick Ringo
Dance all night, dance all night

01:00:15.970 --> 01:00:20.098
I've got dancing legs
I've got dancing legs

01:00:20.099 --> 01:00:23.810
They won't stop me dancing, no
They won't stop me dancing

01:00:23.811 --> 01:00:26.230
Kiss me, just kiss me

01:00:26.231 --> 01:00:29.775
Kiss me, Nefertiti
Just the way you like it

01:00:29.776 --> 01:00:33.737
Just the way you like
it Kiss me, kiss me

01:00:33.738 --> 01:00:38.624
Lipstick kiss me, lipstick Ringo
That's the way you like it

01:00:43.831 --> 01:00:47.918
- This is your most likable song ever?
- Yeah.

01:00:47.919 --> 01:00:52.930
- People will love it.
- Actually, actually, Frank,...

01:00:53.341 --> 01:00:58.303
I think that we could push
the likability even further.

01:00:58.304 --> 01:01:00.889
No way.

01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:03.183
You're shitting me. How?

01:01:03.184 --> 01:01:05.102
Can I just...?

01:01:05.103 --> 01:01:07.187
Erm... Where did you start?

01:01:10.692 --> 01:01:15.036
But what if, I don't know,
we regulate it a bit more?

01:01:19.075 --> 01:01:21.702
I love it. I love it.

01:01:21.703 --> 01:01:25.747
And then if you played an F down here,
that would be good, wouldn't it?

01:01:25.748 --> 01:01:29.376
You should be famous.
That's so likable.

01:01:29.377 --> 01:01:31.803
Jon fixed it.

01:01:38.803 --> 01:01:41.263
I'm officially here. Check me.

01:01:41.264 --> 01:01:43.557
Hello. Sorry.

01:01:43.558 --> 01:01:48.979
We're igniting the light
and letting it shine.

01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:51.398
Hi. Can I get a quick word with you?

01:01:51.399 --> 01:01:55.193
We were in the forest like secret
squirrels. Now we're likable.

01:01:55.194 --> 01:01:57.537
We're so...

01:01:57.697 --> 01:02:00.365
It's gonna be huge.
Jon fixed everything.

01:02:00.366 --> 01:02:04.494
You've gotta see us tomorrow night.
I promise nothing bad will happen to you.

01:02:04.495 --> 01:02:07.539
- Let's go take a walk.
- I'm incredibly happy to be here.

01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:09.583
I'm fine. I'm relaxed.

01:02:09.584 --> 01:02:15.464
Forgive me for my problems formerly.
People were liking it. The weight.

01:02:15.465 --> 01:02:20.685
I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm totally relaxed.
I'm fine. I'm perfectly fine.

01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:25.724
- Frank's not OK.
- What are you talking about?

01:02:25.725 --> 01:02:28.226
I need your help to
get him out of here.

01:02:28.227 --> 01:02:31.188
He said he's perfectly
fine and relaxed.

01:02:31.189 --> 01:02:33.732
I need your help to
get him out of here.

01:02:33.733 --> 01:02:35.700
He looks happy to me.

01:02:36.694 --> 01:02:40.329
- Whereas you seem...
- I seem what?

01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:43.749
Not in control.

01:03:03.971 --> 01:03:10.109
Frank?

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:20.529
Have you seen a man
wearing a fake head? No?

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:23.907
Sorry, have you seen a
man wearing a fake head?

01:03:23.908 --> 01:03:27.418
A very big head? He and a
lady went around the corner.

01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:33.424
Frank. Frank! Frank!

01:03:38.965 --> 01:03:40.298
Frank?

01:03:40.299 --> 01:03:43.684
- Can you feel my breath?
- Frank.

01:03:46.597 --> 01:03:49.315
What the fuck are you doing?

01:03:50.165 --> 01:03:53.885
Breathe, breathe. It's OK.

01:03:54.772 --> 01:03:57.841
Do you want to come back
to the hotel, Frank?

01:03:58.142 --> 01:04:00.451
It's warm there.

01:04:01.195 --> 01:04:06.408
Don't listen to her. She's
the one who's nuts. Not you.

01:04:06.409 --> 01:04:09.995
Tomorrow night is everything
we've worked for.

01:04:09.996 --> 01:04:14.249
- They're ready to love us.
- Can you feel my breath?

01:04:14.250 --> 01:04:16.801
They're ready to love you, Frank.

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:20.429
Don't throw that away.

01:04:20.923 --> 01:04:23.724
Frank, stay with me.

01:04:26.971 --> 01:04:28.813
Thank God.

01:04:33.519 --> 01:04:35.653
Come on.

01:04:39.358 --> 01:04:41.284
I'm sorry.

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:45.037
Are you a little sad?

01:04:45.865 --> 01:04:49.409
Yes, Jon, I'm a little bit sad.

01:04:49.410 --> 01:04:51.495
Oh, no. Chinchilla! Chin...

01:04:51.496 --> 01:04:55.165
- Fuck!
- Frank, he's fucking crazy.

01:04:55.166 --> 01:04:57.542
She's stabbed me in the fucking leg!

01:04:57.543 --> 01:04:59.294
Get off me!

01:04:59.295 --> 01:05:00.587
Frank! Who are you?

01:05:00.588 --> 01:05:04.299
'Clara Wagner, our
very own Syd Barrett,

01:05:04.300 --> 01:05:09.471
'was arrested today and charged with
assault after stabbing me in the leg.

01:05:09.472 --> 01:05:11.856
'See link.

01:05:13.017 --> 01:05:15.185
'We will all miss Clara

01:05:15.186 --> 01:05:16.520
'and sincerely hope

01:05:16.521 --> 01:05:17.979
'our own crazy diamond

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:21.240
'will also shine on.'

01:05:22.526 --> 01:05:25.828
Nana, open up. Baraque!

01:05:26.239 --> 01:05:28.456
Is he here?

01:05:34.664 --> 01:05:36.881
How is he?

01:05:37.041 --> 01:05:39.425
He's sleeping.

01:05:40.253 --> 01:05:42.087
He's dead?

01:05:42.088 --> 01:05:46.182
Asleep.

01:05:46.926 --> 01:05:49.352
He's sick.

01:05:50.721 --> 01:05:52.813
No, no, he's...

01:05:53.057 --> 01:05:55.725
He's just tired.
He'll be alright for tonight.

01:05:55.726 --> 01:05:58.986
Not Frank. You.

01:05:59.397 --> 01:06:01.238
Sorry?

01:06:02.525 --> 01:06:08.196
I've known this since the first
time I saw him on that beach.

01:06:08.197 --> 01:06:11.074
He would have drowned Lucas
to take his place in the band.

01:06:11.075 --> 01:06:12.325
No, I wouldn't have.

01:06:12.326 --> 01:06:16.913
Because when he looks inside himself,
he can't find anything there.

01:06:16.914 --> 01:06:18.081
Yes, I can.

01:06:18.082 --> 01:06:21.126
So his only hope is to live
off your talent like a tick.

01:06:21.127 --> 01:06:24.212
- Sorry?
- Which is why he got rid of Clara.

01:06:24.213 --> 01:06:27.924
- Clara chose to stab me.
- We're not playing without Clara.

01:06:27.925 --> 01:06:31.845
What? We've got the biggest gig
of our lives in three hours.

01:06:31.846 --> 01:06:34.973
The stabbing could not have
come at a better time, Frank.

01:06:34.974 --> 01:06:37.309
Everyone at South by Southwest...

01:06:37.310 --> 01:06:40.020
Baraque and I have packed.
We're leaving.

01:06:40.021 --> 01:06:45.942
No, you can't leave.
We've had 767,328 hits.

01:06:46.243 --> 01:06:48.236
Frank, say something.

01:06:48.237 --> 01:06:52.248
- 767,918. They're all watching.
- Frank.

01:06:54.243 --> 01:06:57.878
- So many people.
- See?

01:07:00.458 --> 01:07:04.885
- So many people.
- Don't...

01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:09.682
Good luck playing
tonight without a band.

01:07:09.884 --> 01:07:13.144
I've got one word for you.

01:07:15.097 --> 01:07:18.308
Unplugged! Me on
guitar, you on vocals.

01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:22.187
Delegates really like it when bands
go unplugged. Special thing.

01:07:25.066 --> 01:07:27.317
- How's your leg?
- It'll be OK.

01:07:27.318 --> 01:07:30.070
We set everything up.
Sure you wanna go ahead?

01:07:30.071 --> 01:07:31.613
Absolutely.

01:07:31.614 --> 01:07:34.282
Igniting the light and
letting it shine.

01:07:34.283 --> 01:07:37.077
- Frank, are you OK?
- Uh-huh.

01:07:37.078 --> 01:07:41.456
- If I was you guys I'd be so nervous.
- Oh, goes with the territory.

01:07:41.457 --> 01:07:45.669
Yeah, but, I mean, playing without
your band after what just happened...

01:07:45.670 --> 01:07:48.421
Shit, man, I would be nervous.

01:07:48.422 --> 01:07:51.132
It's not like we don't know
the songs or anything.

01:07:51.133 --> 01:07:54.511
With that many people,
I would be shitting myself.

01:07:54.512 --> 01:07:58.264
- Would you please shut your mouth?
- I'm just saying...

01:08:10.444 --> 01:08:13.154
- Where are you going?
- Do my ablutions.

01:08:13.155 --> 01:08:15.289
That's not the toilet.

01:08:16.033 --> 01:08:18.876
Just be as quick as you can.

01:08:21.580 --> 01:08:24.506
- 30 seconds.
- Frank?

01:08:25.876 --> 01:08:30.386
- Frank?
- Let's fuck!

01:08:35.261 --> 01:08:38.354
Just wait here for
a few seconds, OK?

01:08:43.435 --> 01:08:45.611
Hello.

01:08:49.774 --> 01:08:51.234
Prepare for rapture!

01:09:00.943 --> 01:09:02.786
Yeah!

01:09:02.830 --> 01:09:05.582
Hello, South by Southwest!

01:09:09.587 --> 01:09:12.921
It's been a crazy 24 hours,
but we're still here,

01:09:12.923 --> 01:09:15.975
and we're still the Soronprfbs!

01:09:17.428 --> 01:09:18.803
Unplugged.

01:09:18.804 --> 01:09:21.346
Chinchilla!

01:09:21.348 --> 01:09:23.649
Chinchilla!

01:09:25.352 --> 01:09:29.022
- Yeah!
- OK. Here's a little song I wrote.

01:09:29.023 --> 01:09:33.318
I hope you like it. This is
the best day of my life.

01:09:42.328 --> 01:09:53.546
La la la-la la

01:09:53.546 --> 01:09:54.672
Come on, Frank!

01:09:54.673 --> 01:09:58.809
La la la-la la

01:10:03.974 --> 01:10:07.143
Fuck! Fuck!

01:10:07.544 --> 01:10:10.396
Frank. Frank.

01:10:10.397 --> 01:10:11.898
Frank!

01:10:11.899 --> 01:10:15.485
What is it, Frank?
Frank, come on. What is it?

01:10:15.486 --> 01:10:18.287
The music's shit.

01:10:20.866 --> 01:10:23.452
The music is shit.

01:10:51.438 --> 01:10:54.274
'...Cleveland, Ohio band,
The Gentile Youth,

01:10:54.275 --> 01:10:56.359
'had all of Austin
talking last night

01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:59.696
'when they played a barnstorming
set at South by Southwest.'

01:11:04.618 --> 01:11:09.129
Aren't we supposed to be
playing at South by Southwest?

01:11:11.917 --> 01:11:14.176
Frank...

01:11:14.461 --> 01:11:17.846
I know you weren't
happy with the music.

01:11:17.965 --> 01:11:21.058
So let's work on it together.

01:11:26.348 --> 01:11:28.649
Why not?

01:11:29.351 --> 01:11:31.819
You're not Clara.

01:11:49.371 --> 01:11:53.291
The motel owner says if we haven't
paid in full by the end of the week,

01:11:53.292 --> 01:11:55.426
they're throwing us out.

01:11:56.754 --> 01:11:59.923
- Fuck's sake!
- Oh, jeepers.

01:11:59.924 --> 01:12:02.725
- Fuck.
- It's alright. I'm sorry.

01:12:03.677 --> 01:12:07.521
Just leave it. Oh, you stink!

01:12:12.519 --> 01:12:17.322
I made it. Now, will you use it?

01:12:30.788 --> 01:12:33.172
Take it off.

01:12:34.833 --> 01:12:37.384
The head.

01:12:39.213 --> 01:12:41.638
Maybe you should take it off.

01:12:43.634 --> 01:12:48.395
In cognitive behavioural therapy,
they say... face your fears.

01:12:49.473 --> 01:12:53.859
They say, take the head off.
So let's do it.

01:12:55.813 --> 01:13:00.358
- Let's take the fucking head off.
- I have a certificate.

01:13:00.359 --> 01:13:02.826
I know you have a certificate.

01:13:03.821 --> 01:13:06.772
I know you've got a
motherfucking certificate!

01:13:06.773 --> 01:13:08.783
Just take it off!

01:13:08.784 --> 01:13:12.829
Take it off! Fucking hell!

01:13:13.830 --> 01:13:15.815
Frank, I'm sorry! I...

01:13:16.959 --> 01:13:20.086
Frank! Frank! No!

01:13:20.087 --> 01:13:23.555
Frank! I'm sorry. Come back!

01:13:40.816 --> 01:13:43.826
- Where did he go?
- That way.

01:13:44.194 --> 01:13:47.329
- Is he injured?
- He was limping.

01:13:48.490 --> 01:13:50.541
Did you see his face?

01:13:59.918 --> 01:14:02.795
'Yeah, hello. You wanna
report a missing person?'

01:14:02.796 --> 01:14:05.681
- Yes.
- 'Name?'

01:14:07.259 --> 01:14:11.103
- Frank.
- 'Frank what?'

01:14:12.389 --> 01:14:14.898
Just Frank.

01:14:15.684 --> 01:14:17.310
'Age?'

01:14:17.311 --> 01:14:21.029
Somewhere between 30 and...

01:14:21.482 --> 01:14:23.490
50.

01:14:24.151 --> 01:14:28.495
'And what does this
person look like?'

01:14:51.762 --> 01:14:54.980
Driving me crazy,
but I know who you are.

01:14:56.141 --> 01:14:59.651
- Hmm?
- You're the Chinchilla guy, right?

01:15:00.187 --> 01:15:01.938
- Hm-hmm.
- Awesome.

01:15:01.939 --> 01:15:07.527
And there's the dude with the big head
and the crazy chick. Clara, right?

01:15:07.528 --> 01:15:09.987
Dude, you guys are,
like, total myths.

01:15:09.988 --> 01:15:13.241
I mean, there's fucking footage
of you everywhere online.

01:15:13.242 --> 01:15:15.785
Chinchilla guy!

01:15:15.786 --> 01:15:18.496
- Chinchilla guy.
- Chinchilla guy!

01:15:18.497 --> 01:15:20.873
See? I mean, all the footage.

01:15:20.874 --> 01:15:24.001
You're all totally erratic and
shit, nervous breakdowns.

01:15:24.002 --> 01:15:27.171
Chinchilla! People rolling
around on the floor.

01:15:27.172 --> 01:15:29.924
I mean, just wayward stuff, man.

01:15:29.925 --> 01:15:33.970
And now it's all like, "What happened
to Frank? It's like he just vanished."

01:15:33.971 --> 01:15:38.398
- I mean, fucking hilarious.
- I don't think it's hilarious.

01:15:38.642 --> 01:15:41.310
Really? I thought it was
supposed to be hilarious.

01:15:41.311 --> 01:15:42.562
It's...

01:15:42.563 --> 01:15:48.867
But, I mean, Clara and Frank, man.
Come on, they're, like... total freaks.

01:16:00.372 --> 01:16:04.000
On top of

01:16:04.001 --> 01:16:12.015
Old Smoky

01:16:14.511 --> 01:16:19.098
All covered

01:16:19.099 --> 01:16:23.902
With snow

01:16:30.527 --> 01:16:39.251
I lost my poor lover

01:16:50.547 --> 01:16:57.894
By courting too slow

01:17:02.684 --> 01:17:05.235
How did you find us?

01:17:08.732 --> 01:17:11.158
I saw...

01:17:21.453 --> 01:17:24.129
Everything you said was true, Nana.

01:17:24.998 --> 01:17:27.090
I ruined everything.

01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:29.926
I'm sorry.

01:17:30.671 --> 01:17:33.013
So sorry.

01:17:36.343 --> 01:17:38.810
Frank ran away.

01:17:39.930 --> 01:17:42.105
I don't know if...

01:17:43.600 --> 01:17:47.444
I was hoping you might
know where he is.

01:18:34.318 --> 01:18:36.360
Ain't nobody here
wears no fake head.

01:18:40.073 --> 01:18:42.040
OK.

01:19:10.729 --> 01:19:13.363
Bluff, Kansas.

01:19:24.951 --> 01:19:27.294
Be careful.

01:19:44.596 --> 01:19:46.438
Hi.

01:20:03.824 --> 01:20:06.333
Frank?

01:20:09.037 --> 01:20:11.630
Frank, I'm so ashamed.

01:20:13.417 --> 01:20:17.211
I should never have tried to pull
your head off. I don't know...

01:20:17.212 --> 01:20:21.924
I'm the tree surgeon. I'm just...
I'm just here to look at the tree.

01:20:21.925 --> 01:20:24.100
Can I help you?

01:20:40.402 --> 01:20:43.411
I've been very worried about you.

01:20:44.531 --> 01:20:47.332
I just wanted to find you to...

01:20:48.577 --> 01:20:51.211
make sure you're OK.

01:20:55.542 --> 01:20:58.426
How are things without the head?

01:21:10.182 --> 01:21:15.151
He had such a beautiful face.
Lovely skin.

01:21:16.396 --> 01:21:20.566
The head was my fault.
I made him his first one.

01:21:20.567 --> 01:21:24.904
He was 14, said it was
for a costume party.

01:21:24.905 --> 01:21:29.499
I did it even though I knew
there wasn't any costume party.

01:21:31.077 --> 01:21:35.831
Turns out the worst thing to do with
something like that is to pander to it.

01:21:35.832 --> 01:21:38.133
Who knew?

01:21:49.179 --> 01:21:51.688
What happened to Frank?

01:21:53.266 --> 01:21:56.818
Something must have happened
to him to make him like that.

01:21:57.687 --> 01:22:01.906
Nothing happened to him.
He's got a mental illness.

01:22:02.234 --> 01:22:06.786
The torment he went through...
to make the great music.

01:22:07.864 --> 01:22:11.450
The torment didn't make the music.
He was always musical.

01:22:11.451 --> 01:22:14.753
If anything, it slowed him down.

01:22:17.415 --> 01:22:19.883
It was a good home.

01:22:22.462 --> 01:22:25.180
It's just like my home.

01:22:40.939 --> 01:22:43.615
I have to go now, Frank.

01:22:45.193 --> 01:22:49.079
- You alright?
- Yeah.

01:22:55.745 --> 01:22:58.546
I know I ruined everything.

01:23:00.166 --> 01:23:02.217
I'm sorry.

01:23:11.177 --> 01:23:15.230
- It's good you're still playing.
- I'm not.

01:23:15.974 --> 01:23:18.274
I tried, but...

01:23:18.852 --> 01:23:21.861
it doesn't come out good.

01:23:39.497 --> 01:23:46.344
I want to marry a lighthouse keeper

01:23:46.671 --> 01:23:51.808
And keep him company

01:23:54.095 --> 01:24:01.025
I want to marry a lighthouse keeper

01:24:01.269 --> 01:24:06.406
And live by the side of the sea

01:24:09.444 --> 01:24:14.372
We'll have parties
on a moonlit isle

01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:18.501
And clam bakes

01:24:19.329 --> 01:24:22.630
On a coral reef

01:24:24.668 --> 01:24:28.553
We'll invite everybody in

01:24:29.798 --> 01:24:35.268
And seagulls by the score

01:24:39.015 --> 01:24:43.902
I wanna marry a lighthouse keeper

01:24:52.612 --> 01:24:58.750
I'll polish his lamps
by the light of the day

01:25:08.336 --> 01:25:13.306
I want to marry a lighthouse keeper

01:25:16.594 --> 01:25:20.271
It's really nice... nice to see you.

01:25:22.976 --> 01:25:25.443
It's nice to be here.

01:25:27.897 --> 01:25:30.114
El Madrid.

01:25:32.235 --> 01:25:34.869
I love your wall.

01:25:38.199 --> 01:25:44.087
The washrooms smell.
They could be cleaner.

01:25:50.545 --> 01:25:52.679
Put your arms around me.

01:25:54.549 --> 01:25:57.225
Fiddly digits.

01:25:57.510 --> 01:26:00.019
Itchy britches.

01:26:10.940 --> 01:26:16.820
Stale beer, fat fucked,
smoked out, cowpoked

01:26:16.821 --> 01:26:20.957
Sequinned mountain ladies

01:26:23.119 --> 01:26:27.422
I love your wall

01:26:30.502 --> 01:26:33.378
Put your arms around me

01:26:33.379 --> 01:26:37.223
Fiddly digits, itchy britches

01:26:37.509 --> 01:26:54.449
I love you all

01:26:56.194 --> 01:27:00.864
I love

01:27:00.865 --> 01:27:05.627
You all

01:27:07.705 --> 01:27:10.958
Washrooms smell,
they could be cleaner

01:27:10.959 --> 01:27:13.585
Stench of cigarettes and stale urea

01:27:13.586 --> 01:27:18.640
I love you all

01:27:19.676 --> 01:27:25.973
Prodigal son wants to return
to where the dogs play pool

01:27:25.974 --> 01:27:43.581
I love you all

01:27:43.783 --> 01:27:49.295
I love

01:27:49.497 --> 01:27:54.676
You all

01:28:01.426 --> 01:28:04.720
Stale beer, fat fucked,
cowpoked, smoked out

01:28:04.721 --> 01:28:07.848
Sequinned mountain ladies

01:28:07.849 --> 01:28:12.610
I love you all

01:28:13.771 --> 01:28:16.440
Put your arms around me

01:28:16.441 --> 01:28:19.943
Fiddly digits, itchy britches

01:28:19.944 --> 01:28:37.552
I love you all

01:28:37.837 --> 01:28:43.091
I love

01:28:43.092 --> 01:28:47.395
You all

01:29:17.710 --> 01:29:20.587
El Madrid, it's nice to see ya

01:29:20.588 --> 01:29:23.799
It's really nice to be here

01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:28.770
I love you all

01:29:29.555 --> 01:29:31.306
Stale beer, fat fucked

01:29:31.307 --> 01:29:32.724
Smoked out, cowpoked

01:29:32.725 --> 01:29:35.727
Sequinned mountain ladies

01:29:35.728 --> 01:29:41.282
I love you all

01:29:41.776 --> 01:29:43.902
Put your arms around me

01:29:43.903 --> 01:29:47.698
Fiddly digits, itchy britches

01:29:47.699 --> 01:30:08.844
I love you all

01:30:08.845 --> 01:30:13.974
I love

01:30:13.975 --> 01:30:18.694
You all

01:30:20.773 --> 01:30:23.734
Washrooms smell,
they could be cleaner

01:30:23.735 --> 01:30:26.987
Stench of cigarettes and stale urea

01:30:26.988 --> 01:30:32.208
I love you all

01:30:32.785 --> 01:30:35.412
Prodigal son waits to return

01:30:35.413 --> 01:30:38.749
To where the dogs play pool

01:30:38.750 --> 01:30:56.691
I love you all

01:30:56.851 --> 01:31:02.022
I love

01:31:02.023 --> 01:31:06.951
You all

01:31:14.869 --> 01:31:20.298
Banjaxed and broken

01:31:20.333 --> 01:31:25.344
Smashed up in bits

01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:30.675
That is the only way

01:31:30.676 --> 01:31:34.979
Everything fits

01:31:35.765 --> 01:31:39.810
All held together

01:31:39.811 --> 01:31:44.447
Spitballs and string

01:31:45.066 --> 01:31:48.902
Splinters of wood

01:31:48.903 --> 01:31:53.706
On a bird's broken wing

01:31:54.117 --> 01:31:58.495
Now what's together

01:31:58.496 --> 01:32:03.716
Will soon come apart

01:32:03.876 --> 01:32:08.547
When it's all over

01:32:08.548 --> 01:32:13.309
No back to the start

01:32:31.654 --> 01:32:36.324
Now what's together

01:32:36.325 --> 01:32:41.295
Will soon come apart

01:32:41.497 --> 01:32:46.376
When it's all over

01:32:46.377 --> 01:32:52.431
No back to the start

01:33:01.893 --> 01:33:04.060
Lonely little carpet tuft

01:33:04.061 --> 01:33:06.646
A twisted woolly Joshua tree

01:33:06.647 --> 01:33:08.982
Surrounded by its fallen friends

01:33:08.983 --> 01:33:11.401
Alone in a threadbare woven field

01:33:11.402 --> 01:33:18.165
Lone standing tuft

01:33:21.579 --> 01:33:27.842
Defy the foot

01:33:30.713 --> 01:33:32.923
What age are you in carpet years?

01:33:32.924 --> 01:33:35.258
Is it spring and you're
the first to wake?

01:33:35.259 --> 01:33:37.677
Or are you old but
still strong enough

01:33:37.678 --> 01:33:40.263
To keep what winter wants to take?

01:33:40.264 --> 01:33:46.986
Lone standing tuft

01:33:50.233 --> 01:33:56.746
Defy the foot

01:33:59.742 --> 01:34:01.868
Is it luck that
you're still standing

01:34:01.869 --> 01:34:04.162
And you've not been flattened too?

01:34:04.163 --> 01:34:06.248
Do you tremble in the little wind

01:34:06.249 --> 01:34:09.125
That's squeezed out by my shoe?

01:34:09.126 --> 01:34:15.639
Lone standing tuft

01:34:19.095 --> 01:34:25.608
Defy the foot

01:34:28.437 --> 01:34:30.897
Has your tuftiness mutated so

01:34:30.898 --> 01:34:33.233
Your strands are made of steel?

01:34:33.234 --> 01:34:35.318
Is it sheer determination

01:34:35.319 --> 01:34:37.821
You'll never bend beneath the heel?

01:34:37.822 --> 01:34:44.502
Lone standing tuft

01:34:48.082 --> 01:34:53.761
Defy the foot

01:34:54.305 --> 01:35:00.665
