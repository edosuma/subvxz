WEBVTT

00:10.680 --> 00:12.920
You let Old Man Bracket sell you too
many.

00:13.960 --> 00:16.158
They're fresh from his allotment.

00:16.160 --> 00:17.999
It were a steal.

00:18.000 --> 00:19.799
You know why it was a steal.

00:19.800 --> 00:22.239
He's grown too many, and he can't
get rid.

00:22.240 --> 00:25.320
Neither can you. Just watch this
space.

00:25.360 --> 00:27.759
You couldn't get rid of Dr Proctor's
nerve tonic,.

00:27.760 --> 00:31.399
That were different, weren't it?
Now we're professionals.

00:31.400 --> 00:33.439
Watch this. Watch this.

00:33.440 --> 00:35.879
Good day to you, Mrs Teasdale,

00:35.880 --> 00:40.319
don't tell me you intend walking
past these lovely fresh turnips?

00:40.320 --> 00:42.840
Turnips? Oh, we're into quinoa.

00:45.600 --> 00:48.360
Last year she thought that quinoa
was near Benidorm.

01:11.640 --> 01:13.039
HE SNIFFS

01:13.040 --> 01:14.440
HE SIGHS

01:17.720 --> 01:21.159
Some girl was making a lot of noise
in this doorway last night.

01:21.160 --> 01:22.799
Woke you up, did she?

01:22.800 --> 01:24.200
Very much. I was with her.

01:26.040 --> 01:28.079
She never stops yakking.

01:28.080 --> 01:30.360
Worth it though, if you just ignore
it and keep snogging.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.959
She's going to uni next month.

01:34.960 --> 01:37.600
I expect they'll ruin her for normal
purposes.

02:00.360 --> 02:03.799
We're going to have to put a
muzzle on this till.

02:03.800 --> 02:06.640
I think I'm in love with someone
gobby and intelligent.

02:06.680 --> 02:09.320
Intelligence would do you no good at
all.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.760
Gobby gets things done.

02:11.800 --> 02:14.599
She wanted to know what I thought
about Salvador Dali.

02:14.600 --> 02:17.000
I told her, I don't even know who he
plays for.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.280
She immediately withdrew my snogging
privileges.

02:22.720 --> 02:26.599
Snogging? I thought you said that
she were a talker.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.400
Yeah, she talks through it.

02:29.920 --> 02:32.599
Morning. Good morning, Gastric.

02:32.600 --> 02:35.679
Right, what do I fancy for
breakfast?

02:35.680 --> 02:36.720
Turnip.

02:38.360 --> 02:40.160
For breakfast?

02:40.200 --> 02:42.239
It's the new quinoa.

02:42.240 --> 02:44.480
You enjoyed it yesterday.

02:44.520 --> 02:46.479
I had bacon and eggs yesterday.

02:46.480 --> 02:49.919
Yes, you did, with thin fried
slices of turnip.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.680
You said how much you enjoyed it.

02:52.720 --> 02:55.520
I never came in here twice yesterday
morning?

02:55.560 --> 02:56.840
I were working on a roof.

02:57.960 --> 03:00.960
Oh, dear, your memory's going.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.959
We've seen it coming, me and Leroy.
Don't you remember?

03:04.960 --> 03:06.240
Madge was in here.

03:07.800 --> 03:10.199
She gave you a kiss.

03:10.200 --> 03:12.439
I don't remember that.

03:12.440 --> 03:15.040
She usually goes, "Eww"!

03:16.720 --> 03:18.680
It's worse than we thought.

03:19.920 --> 03:21.760
I'm saying nothing.

03:21.800 --> 03:22.800
You see...

03:24.080 --> 03:27.119
Leroy's too choked up to speak.

03:27.120 --> 03:28.319
He said to me, he said,

03:28.320 --> 03:32.079
he was getting so worried about
Gastric losing his memory permanently.

03:32.080 --> 03:35.440
I said, "No, don't you worry,
Leroy," I said.

03:35.480 --> 03:39.960
I said, "You're forgetting that we
have the cure."

03:40.000 --> 03:41.519
There's a cure?

03:41.520 --> 03:46.000
Yes. Treasured since Roman times for
restoring the memory.

03:48.800 --> 03:49.839
A turnip?

03:49.840 --> 03:54.080
A turnip. They never went anywhere
without their raw turnip.

03:55.640 --> 03:57.640
That's why they had short swords.

03:58.800 --> 04:01.640
Because the rest of the scabbard was
filled up with raw turnip.

04:14.600 --> 04:16.440
Here we are, Cyril.

04:16.480 --> 04:20.560
Please accept this small, free gift,
with our compliments.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.159
What is it?

04:23.160 --> 04:26.839
It's one of nature's premier
remedies.

04:26.840 --> 04:29.680
You put it around your ankles, and
it keeps the smidges away.

04:31.120 --> 04:33.119
Raw turnip round your ankles?

04:33.120 --> 04:35.160
Yes, well, we don't recommend it
mashed.

04:36.560 --> 04:39.480
It doesn't have the same
prophylactic effect.

04:41.040 --> 04:42.759
And what are smidges?

04:42.760 --> 04:44.320
You mean midges.

04:44.360 --> 04:46.719
No, no, midges are visible.

04:46.720 --> 04:50.559
Smidges are too small to be seen
with the naked eye.

04:50.560 --> 04:52.600
So how do you know that they're
there?

04:53.840 --> 04:56.880
Well, you don't, of course, unless
you have a smidge detector.

04:59.400 --> 05:02.400
Don't tell me you haven't got a
smidge detector?

05:02.440 --> 05:04.200
Oh, dear, oh dear.

05:05.600 --> 05:06.640
Oh.

05:07.920 --> 05:11.479
Never mind, here you are, one smidge
detector.

05:11.480 --> 05:13.320
There you go.

05:13.360 --> 05:17.240
It changes colour if the little
beggars are about.

05:17.280 --> 05:19.239
And, of course, you can tell they're
about now,

05:19.240 --> 05:21.080
because five minutes ago that were
blue.

05:22.520 --> 05:25.679
Because that holds your slice of
turnip in place

05:25.680 --> 05:28.080
when you put it round your ankle.

05:30.200 --> 05:31.760
Why round your ankle?

05:31.800 --> 05:34.480
Because that's where they are,
aren't they, the smidges -

05:34.520 --> 05:36.079
they're not high-flyers.

05:36.080 --> 05:38.519
No, smidges are very, very low.

05:38.520 --> 05:40.760
They're sneaky. They come in low
like that,

05:40.800 --> 05:44.199
they go EEH, they hit you on the
ankle, and go DZZZ like that.

05:44.200 --> 05:45.960
And SPLAT - they've gone.

05:48.680 --> 05:50.240
So no serious effects, then?

05:51.560 --> 05:52.920
Well...

05:53.760 --> 05:59.240
Er, no. Not if you don't mind losing
all of your masculine vigour.

06:00.960 --> 06:05.320
Not to mention your interest in
the... opposite sex.

06:07.120 --> 06:08.600
No, please, don't let me keep you.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.760
How much?

06:11.800 --> 06:14.159
£4.25.

06:14.160 --> 06:15.679
What, for a rubber band?

06:15.680 --> 06:18.120
But you do get the turnip absolutely
free.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.280
Are you sure this is going to work?

06:25.320 --> 06:28.080
Trust me. It's one of my best
advertising gimmicks.

06:29.520 --> 06:32.960
Oh, excuse me. Do you mind taking a
look at this?

06:33.000 --> 06:34.799
Do you recognise this man?

06:34.800 --> 06:36.719
I know he lives in this area.

06:36.720 --> 06:39.880
He promised he'd write, but, of
course, he never has.

06:41.080 --> 06:42.080
Wait, that's...

06:42.120 --> 06:43.120
Hmmm.

06:44.760 --> 06:46.200
Very unfamiliar.

06:46.240 --> 06:48.125
Dodgy, but unfamiliar.

06:48.150 --> 06:50.839
Then would you mind keeping it and
showing it to your customers?

06:50.840 --> 06:53.639
I'll be back later, thank you.

06:53.640 --> 06:55.360
Eh, she had...

06:55.400 --> 06:56.720
I know that. Come on.

06:57.920 --> 06:59.399
20p for that apple.

06:59.400 --> 07:00.560
You must be joking!

07:03.520 --> 07:06.360
Don't be alarmed, Mr Newbould, it's
only me.

07:07.360 --> 07:09.639
Or should that be "I"?

07:09.640 --> 07:12.759
Whatever. It's only us.

07:12.760 --> 07:15.119
Ah, there you are.

07:15.120 --> 07:18.080
Don't mind me. You carry on with
whatever you're doing.

07:18.120 --> 07:19.680
Whatever it is.

07:20.920 --> 07:22.720
Reading?

07:22.760 --> 07:24.759
Straining the brain, Mr Newbould.

07:24.760 --> 07:26.199
I've seen it happen.

07:26.200 --> 07:29.040
It's only my
stamp album, it's hardly a strain.

07:29.080 --> 07:32.159
I had to ban my second husband from
reading anything exciting when he

07:32.160 --> 07:34.920
threw off his pyjamas and claimed
the right to sleep naked.

07:39.200 --> 07:41.080
How are you on pyjamas, Mr Newbould?

07:42.440 --> 07:45.959
I'm for them. The thicker the
better.

07:45.960 --> 07:47.280
I knew I could rely on you.

07:48.840 --> 07:51.999
Oh, drinking already?

07:52.000 --> 07:54.200
It's only my sister's home-made
wine.

07:55.920 --> 07:57.679
May I offer you a glass?

07:57.680 --> 08:01.319
You may. Though it won't further
your naughtier intentions.

08:01.320 --> 08:03.960
I have an iron constitution.

08:04.000 --> 08:05.760
I don't doubt that for a moment.

08:07.440 --> 08:10.279
And I'm unaware of any naughty
intentions.

08:10.280 --> 08:12.280
Oh, they'll be there.
They always are.

08:12.320 --> 08:16.530
Even my third husband came alive if
he I fed him too many carbohydrates.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.080
This is rather strong.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.879
Pleasant, but one never knows what
punch may lurk

08:23.880 --> 08:25.680
in these home-made things.

08:29.160 --> 08:31.559
Mm! Oh, yes.

08:31.560 --> 08:33.000
That is very pleasant.

08:37.440 --> 08:39.080
I think we'll do that again.

08:46.840 --> 08:48.760
Whose pram might that be?

08:48.800 --> 08:51.879
Why ask me?
Am I the local know it all?

08:51.880 --> 08:53.720
Usually. It's true.

08:54.960 --> 08:57.160
And now I'm feeling challenged,
because I don't know

08:57.200 --> 09:00.519
who's recently been filling prams
round here.

09:00.520 --> 09:03.720
I hope young Leroy's chickens
haven't come home to roost.

09:03.760 --> 09:07.840
Don't say that. I always think Leroy
is such a charmer.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.560
So, yes, of course, you could be
right.

09:11.600 --> 09:13.760
It's one of his advertising stunts.

09:16.040 --> 09:18.119
Where does he come up with these
things?

09:18.120 --> 09:19.919
I wonder where he got t'pram?

09:19.920 --> 09:21.559
I wonder where he got t'baby.

09:21.560 --> 09:23.999
I usually know who's scattering THEM
about.

09:24.000 --> 09:26.000
There can't be a baby in.

09:26.040 --> 09:28.680
Even he wouldn't leave a baby
outside.

09:28.720 --> 09:31.320
Unless there's a profit in it.

10:04.880 --> 10:07.039
You wanted to see me? Yes.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.280
Yes. Come in.

10:10.920 --> 10:13.040
And what have you been up to?

10:15.080 --> 10:16.080
Not a lot, lately.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.960
I'm saying lately, I mean ages.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.400
There an angry female looking for
you.

10:23.400 --> 10:26.360
I'm married. Tell me something I
don't know.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.039
This is not Cath.

10:31.040 --> 10:36.080
This is another angry female, one
that we don't know.

10:36.120 --> 10:38.119
Did she say what it was about?

10:38.120 --> 10:40.999
No, but she didn't look too pleased.

10:41.000 --> 10:43.520
So not only is there a strange woman
looking for me,

10:43.560 --> 10:45.040
it's a strange woman in a bad mood?

10:46.280 --> 10:48.199
It's typical.

10:48.200 --> 10:52.400
Where did I get this gift for
arousing female hostility?

10:52.440 --> 10:57.439
Well, hell hath no fury. Who have
you been scorning lately, Eric?

10:57.440 --> 11:00.039
Hey, hey. Ah!

11:00.040 --> 11:01.719
You didn't give them my address?

11:01.720 --> 11:04.240
No, no, no, I didn't. No, calm down.

11:04.280 --> 11:05.280
Relax.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.520
I can help you there.

11:08.560 --> 11:09.560
Yeah.

11:15.320 --> 11:16.839
Cath's going to kill me.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.680
Why, what have you done?

11:18.720 --> 11:21.839
Nothing I can remember.
She'll think of something.

11:21.840 --> 11:24.560
You're going to need one of these.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.679
Help you calm your nerves.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.000
Have you seen my brother-in-law?

11:29.280 --> 11:31.280
Don't you think one turnip in the
family is enough?

11:33.000 --> 11:38.079
With some people it's rocks, with
others it's turnips.

11:38.080 --> 11:41.999
What you do is you hold it,
you stroke it,

11:42.000 --> 11:46.200
and it will lead you peacefully to
your calm centre.

11:52.640 --> 11:54.520
I'm going to look a right muffin
stroking it.

11:56.360 --> 12:00.999
Not only will this turnip bring you
immediate tranquillity,

12:01.000 --> 12:05.520
but a recent survey of 78% of
people

12:05.560 --> 12:10.600
reported it stimulated their
partner's urge

12:10.640 --> 12:11.760
to possess them.

12:18.920 --> 12:21.119
£4.75.

12:21.120 --> 12:22.719
£4.75?!

12:22.720 --> 12:24.760
Ah! But it includes...

12:26.840 --> 12:28.480
Free of charge.

12:36.960 --> 12:38.200
Right, now watch this.

12:45.080 --> 12:48.680
Right. You give the customer a
fright.

12:49.800 --> 12:54.040
And then be ready with your
Dr Proctor's nerve tonic.

12:55.280 --> 12:57.280
You can put your spider away.

12:57.320 --> 12:59.720
It won't work. In my opinion, no
chance.

13:06.040 --> 13:08.639
As I looked from my window I
accidentally saw you last night

13:08.640 --> 13:11.160
in the shop doorway. With the one
who's going to uni.

13:12.880 --> 13:15.360
You seemed very interested in higher
education.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.199
She only gave me a B minus.

13:18.200 --> 13:21.040
You should go where there's a chance
of straight As.

13:21.080 --> 13:23.480
Now then, how may we help you?

13:25.120 --> 13:26.120
I don't want a turnip.

13:27.200 --> 13:29.959
We've got a special offer on nerve
tonic.

13:29.960 --> 13:32.600
Why would I need nerve tonic?

13:32.640 --> 13:35.240
I'm only modestly educated, but a
rock of stability.

13:36.920 --> 13:38.080
SHE SCREAMS

13:40.520 --> 13:41.560
I'll take it.

13:49.920 --> 13:50.920
Ow!

13:52.280 --> 13:54.320
So who's this woman who's looking
for you?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.639
Ain't it marvellous how word travels
round here?

13:58.640 --> 14:00.439
So who is she?

14:00.440 --> 14:01.879
I don't know!

14:01.880 --> 14:03.920
You'll probably know before I do.

14:06.720 --> 14:10.799
Oh, put your leg away, Cyril,
there's no such thing as smidges.

14:10.800 --> 14:14.360
How do you know if you can't see
them?

14:14.400 --> 14:16.519
I'm just taking precautions.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.119
I wish I was.

14:18.120 --> 14:19.360
There's a woman looking for me.

14:20.360 --> 14:23.400
Oh. So you've got some memory, then?

14:23.440 --> 14:24.840
I'm joking.

14:27.080 --> 14:28.200
I'm joking!

14:31.560 --> 14:33.759
And that will stop the smidges?

14:33.760 --> 14:34.760
Oh, yes.

14:34.761 --> 14:38.560
It's the only effective
countermeasure when used

14:38.600 --> 14:41.080
in conjunction
with your slice of turnip.

14:47.640 --> 14:49.240
Is he on special offer?

14:49.280 --> 14:52.440
We're nearly finished,
Mrs Featherstone.

14:52.480 --> 14:54.519
He's got a hole in his sock.

14:54.520 --> 14:57.119
Well, I didn't know it was going to
be on show.

14:57.120 --> 15:01.799
Yes, well, it is a diagnostic tool,
Mrs Featherstone.

15:01.800 --> 15:05.080
Show me a hole in a sock, and I'll
show you where the smidges have been.

15:05.120 --> 15:06.964
Smidges eat your socks?

15:09.320 --> 15:12.159
I am looking at you, Granville,

15:12.160 --> 15:17.640
through the glow of Mr Newbould's
sister's home-made wine.

15:18.880 --> 15:22.119
It's tilted your hat,
Mrs Featherstone.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.919
Oh, it's tilted more than that,
Granville.

15:24.920 --> 15:28.960
In fact, I am leaning towards...

15:31.440 --> 15:34.919
Put your boots on outside, Gastric!

15:34.920 --> 15:40.159
The next few moments are not for
those with holes in their socks.

15:40.160 --> 15:42.240
Good luck with the next few moments,
Granville.

15:46.520 --> 15:51.359
My relationship with Mr Newbould
gathers pace, Granville.

15:51.360 --> 15:53.159
Oh, he's a good man.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.999
I'd hang onto him, you know.

15:55.000 --> 15:58.680
However, let it be known, that for
the right party,

15:58.720 --> 16:00.079
there is still time.

16:00.080 --> 16:03.559
Time? Yes, yes, just look at the
time.

16:03.560 --> 16:05.359
Oh, dear.

16:05.360 --> 16:08.200
Would you take me as I am,
Granville?

16:12.880 --> 16:14.119
What, now?

16:14.120 --> 16:15.960
With a slightly tilted hat.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.919
Have you ever seen me in disarray
before, Granville?

16:20.920 --> 16:24.079
No. Well, this hat is just the start
of it.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.279
For the right party,

16:25.280 --> 16:28.520
Delphine Featherstone can do
disarray

16:28.560 --> 16:30.680
with the best of them.

16:51.720 --> 16:54.520
Oh, gods, that one's ugly.

17:12.880 --> 17:13.880
It's a bit cold.

17:14.839 --> 17:18.719
And life is going to stay that way
until I get some answers.

17:18.720 --> 17:21.519
Who is this woman who's looking
for you?

17:21.520 --> 17:25.199
Cath, this time I'm innocent.

17:25.200 --> 17:28.800
I am pure snow white.
I hope it's not blinding you.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.320
I don't know who the woman is.

17:34.560 --> 17:36.440
All right.

17:36.480 --> 17:37.480
Well, let's start at...

17:39.360 --> 17:41.440
WHY would this woman be looking for
you?

17:44.120 --> 17:45.279
I have no idea.

17:45.280 --> 17:47.560
What have you been up to?
And when?

17:48.560 --> 17:51.400
And stop fiddling with your foot.
What's that you've got around it?

17:52.600 --> 17:55.240
Oh, you're wearing ankle bracelets
now?

17:56.720 --> 17:58.120
It's a smidge detector.

17:59.720 --> 18:02.120
You can't see them with the naked
eye.

18:04.400 --> 18:07.640
And you wonder why I'm convinced
you're not reliable?

18:13.240 --> 18:14.280
I bought one for you too.

18:16.560 --> 18:18.240
It helps keep your turnip in place.

18:19.840 --> 18:22.800
Eric, am I missing something?

18:24.520 --> 18:26.960
Have you been replaced by something
from outer space?

18:37.920 --> 18:39.759
Right, you're all loaded up.

18:39.760 --> 18:42.320
Oh, and listen, when you get to Mrs
Atkinson's...

18:44.120 --> 18:45.239
Yes.

18:45.240 --> 18:48.280
When you get to Mrs Atkinson's,
knock three times...

18:49.400 --> 18:51.320
Pause. And three times again.

18:52.960 --> 18:55.560
She's nervous. She won't open up to
strangers.

18:56.800 --> 18:57.960
What are you doing?

18:58.000 --> 19:01.720
Mrs Featherstone
seriously bent my spider.

19:01.760 --> 19:03.840
She has the same affect on me.

19:03.880 --> 19:06.760
Anyway, you're going to serve
Mrs Featherstone in future.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.080
What kind of future's that?

19:11.240 --> 19:13.279
Now, watch this.

19:13.280 --> 19:14.880
Little gag for Mavis.

19:21.280 --> 19:24.640
I'll show her what she does to this
beating heart.

19:33.160 --> 19:35.040
Thank you, as ever, Mrs Hussein.

19:35.080 --> 19:36.640
Oh, er...

19:37.720 --> 19:41.279
Can I tempt you with a turnip?

19:41.280 --> 19:43.440
You can tempt me with or without,
Leroy.

19:47.400 --> 19:49.040
Speaking of turnips...

19:51.520 --> 19:53.280
You should be ashamed of yourself.

19:58.960 --> 20:03.239
Oh, Nora, the women are born
sharp-tongued round here.

20:03.240 --> 20:07.919
Speaking of which, who's this female
that's been looking for you?

20:07.920 --> 20:10.280
I keep telling you, I've no idea.

20:10.320 --> 20:12.999
Come on, you can tell me.

20:13.000 --> 20:15.439
I never shopped you about that
barmaid, did I?

20:15.440 --> 20:16.639
What barmaid?

20:16.640 --> 20:18.080
Keep your voice down!

20:19.280 --> 20:20.800
It were perfectly innocent.

20:21.880 --> 20:25.360
We had a mutual interest in...
Japanese prints.

20:28.640 --> 20:31.480
She were in awe of my expertise.

20:31.520 --> 20:34.119
In that particular field.

20:34.120 --> 20:35.160
Which field?

20:36.240 --> 20:37.680
Japanese prints!

20:44.960 --> 20:46.320
Chuffing hell!

20:51.800 --> 20:57.160
Oh, where are we going for
mischievous night?

20:57.200 --> 20:59.119
That's months away.

20:59.120 --> 21:01.359
Haven't you got anything nearer?

21:01.360 --> 21:03.159
Oh no, see, that's the old one,

21:03.160 --> 21:08.142
the new mischievous night is being
formally opened in the back of the shop

21:08.167 --> 21:09.720
after closing.

21:09.760 --> 21:12.079
Is this where I lose another
earring?

21:12.080 --> 21:13.320
I hope so.

21:14.320 --> 21:15.759
Me too.

21:15.760 --> 21:20.000
You know that you make my heart go
pitter pat, pitter pat.

21:25.280 --> 21:26.560
It's OK.

21:26.600 --> 21:29.159
It's just my little joke.

21:29.160 --> 21:30.520
SHE SCREAMS

21:46.200 --> 21:48.040
It's you, isn't it? You're the one.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.400
I've never seen this woman before!
And I can prove it!

21:53.800 --> 21:56.679
Relax. We bought your mum's house.

21:56.680 --> 22:00.039
She said you'd be in touch and tell
us where everything is.

22:00.040 --> 22:02.559
We can't even find the stopcock.

22:02.560 --> 22:03.680
Oh!

22:03.720 --> 22:05.919
Oh, I'm sorry.

22:05.920 --> 22:07.240
She never said anything to me.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.200
She's getting forgetful.

22:10.240 --> 22:12.919
Look, I'll come with you and show
you.

22:12.920 --> 22:14.240
Great. Thank you.

22:15.280 --> 22:16.720
And congratulations.

22:17.800 --> 22:20.160
Oh, no, no, it's not a baby.

22:23.640 --> 22:24.640
It's a turnip.

22:29.480 --> 22:33.119
He looked so pathetic and innocent,
for a minute I almost believed him.

22:33.120 --> 22:34.960
Bad move. They do that.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.240
They think innocence is some sort of
excuse.

22:37.280 --> 22:39.239
Get nasty. Go for it.

22:39.240 --> 22:40.960
What are the odds he'll be innocent?

22:41.000 --> 22:43.280
And if he is, then you can give him
double grief

22:43.320 --> 22:44.920
the next time he slips up.

22:54.480 --> 22:55.800
I knew it.

22:58.760 --> 23:00.879
Knock three times.

23:00.880 --> 23:04.240
Pause and then knock three again.

23:08.440 --> 23:09.440
Pause.

23:26.560 --> 23:29.999
How could you think that I'd be
involved with another woman?

23:30.000 --> 23:34.519
OK, you may be innocent this time,
but it doesn't give you a free pass.

23:34.520 --> 23:36.160
Ah.

23:36.200 --> 23:40.599
But it shows that deep down, you
think I'm unreliable.

23:40.600 --> 23:42.240
You were talking to a turnip.

23:44.640 --> 23:47.680
They can be surprisingly comforting
under times of great stress.

23:49.320 --> 23:51.640
Eric, it's a turnip.

23:54.400 --> 23:56.840
IT has a name.

24:07.920 --> 24:09.439
You're back quick.

24:09.440 --> 24:13.279
Number 14, what goes off in there?

24:13.280 --> 24:14.919
What do you mean what goes off in
there?

24:14.920 --> 24:20.480
Well, I gave the secret knock, you
know, and this naked arm came out.

24:20.520 --> 24:26.080
And it was naked way beyond where an
arm usually finishes.

24:26.120 --> 24:29.720
She's a bit eccentric. She wears a
swimming costume to do her housework.

24:29.760 --> 24:31.080
She's harmless.

24:31.120 --> 24:33.120
Why, does she go swimming?

24:33.160 --> 24:34.240
How would I know?

24:34.280 --> 24:37.079
Well, you know the secret knock.

24:37.080 --> 24:39.280
Have you been splashing about in
there?

24:40.520 --> 24:42.440
She feeds me plum cake.

24:42.480 --> 24:44.079
She makes great plum cake.

24:44.080 --> 24:47.000
She's not exactly dressed for
baking, is she?

24:48.040 --> 24:50.079
That's why she needs the special
knock.

24:50.080 --> 24:53.929
She's not exactly going to open the door to
anybody when she's dressed like that, is she?

24:53.954 --> 24:55.267
No.

24:58.000 --> 24:59.799
Now what are you plotting?

24:59.800 --> 25:02.560
I've got to get the black widow off
my back,

25:02.600 --> 25:05.879
she's not moving fast enough with
Mr Newbould.

25:05.880 --> 25:08.920
You can't throw that poor man into
the jaws of Mrs Featherstone.

25:08.960 --> 25:11.680
Self defence, Leroy. Self defence.

25:11.720 --> 25:14.640
Anyway, I'll make it up to him once
they're married.

25:18.480 --> 25:21.919
French colonial stamps, mint
condition,

25:21.920 --> 25:24.160
entire collection, for sale.

25:24.200 --> 25:27.320
French colonial? That's my field.

25:27.360 --> 25:30.999
Is it? What a coincidence!

25:31.000 --> 25:36.679
I'm sure they said French colonial.
But I'm only repeating what I heard.

25:36.680 --> 25:37.799
Number 14?

25:37.800 --> 25:42.879
Yes, but she won't answer
unless she gets the special knock.

25:42.880 --> 25:43.880
Which is...

25:45.880 --> 25:46.920
Pause.

25:49.960 --> 25:51.199
There.

25:51.200 --> 25:52.440
She must be a keen collector.

25:52.480 --> 25:53.919
Oh, yes, she is.

25:53.920 --> 25:57.680
I thought it was only of young
grocers, but...

26:08.240 --> 26:13.159
How very encouraging of you, to
invite me on this little drive, Granville.

26:13.160 --> 26:15.760
But why are we parking here?

26:17.200 --> 26:20.240
Just taking a breather, Mrs
Featherstone.

26:21.680 --> 26:23.800
Oh, look who's coming.

26:25.320 --> 26:27.959
Oh, I hope he's not following me.

26:27.960 --> 26:29.800
They get obsessed with you.

26:29.840 --> 26:31.040
Well, you know how it is.

26:38.400 --> 26:41.160
Oh! You're a tall person.

26:45.840 --> 26:47.560
Did you see that?

26:47.600 --> 26:50.960
Oh, that - I'll deal with him later.

26:51.880 --> 26:52.960
Ah!

26:53.000 --> 26:55.680
Oh, no, Mrs Featherstone. Smidge!

26:55.720 --> 26:59.160
Smidge attack! And I've got cramp.
It's cramp.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.239
Yes, it is. It's cramp.

27:01.240 --> 27:02.880
Ooh. Ah.

27:02.920 --> 27:05.559
Ooh. Hey.

27:05.560 --> 27:07.959
Sorry. I've got cramp.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.640
And it's, oh, look at that,

27:09.680 --> 27:12.640
it's changed the colour of the
elastic in my underwear.

27:13.880 --> 27:17.120
No, it's cramp. I have to walk it
off, you see.

27:17.160 --> 27:18.879
Sorry, Mrs Featherstone.

27:18.880 --> 27:20.439
Oh!

27:20.440 --> 27:22.999
Well, well, well.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.679
Look who's caused the elastic in his
underpants to change colour.

27:26.680 --> 27:28.879
SHE CHUCKLES

27:28.880 --> 27:32.040
He may fight it, but he's yours,
Delphine.

27:34.520 --> 27:37.040
If you wait I'm sure I can find some
stamps!

27:42.680 --> 27:44.480
I thought she had some French
colonials.

27:45.960 --> 27:48.280
Most of them, I should think,
dressed like that.

27:53.080 --> 27:58.359
It's amazing how that Mrs Featherstone
really fills a small car.

27:58.360 --> 28:00.799
There seemed to be no air.

28:00.800 --> 28:03.319
Just the scent of lavender.

28:03.320 --> 28:06.240
And the creek of corsetry under
stress.

28:11.760 --> 28:15.000
Oh, preserve our Leroy, Lord,

28:15.040 --> 28:20.279
from the perils which lie in the way
for personable young grocers.

28:20.280 --> 28:25.360
And if he has to stumble, let it
lead to a sizeable weekly order.
