WEBVTT

00:05.739 --> 00:07.308
Can you believe this?

00:07.408 --> 00:08.776
Now they're saying
chewing tobacco's

00:08.876 --> 00:11.079
bad for you.

00:11.179 --> 00:14.348
Now?

00:14.448 --> 00:15.549
What are you reading?

00:15.649 --> 00:20.020
Sunset magazine from 1982?

00:21.189 --> 00:24.792
Stole it from
the doctor's office.

00:24.892 --> 00:27.495
You make me wait,
I take something.

00:29.330 --> 00:30.798
Yeah, well,
that would explain

00:30.898 --> 00:33.467
the model of a uterus
on your credenza.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.406
Since when do you care
about chewing tobacco?

00:38.506 --> 00:40.474
I was thinking
of taking it up.

00:42.143 --> 00:43.677
I like a light buzz
and I like to spit.

00:43.777 --> 00:45.113
It just makes sense.

00:47.481 --> 00:49.150
Hi, Grace.

00:51.185 --> 00:52.586
Will...

00:55.656 --> 00:57.758
Would you say I have
a swimmer's body?

00:57.858 --> 01:00.361
Unless it's in
a trunk in your closet,

01:00.461 --> 01:02.130
I'd say no.

01:04.232 --> 01:05.499
Oh, hey, Jane Fonda

01:05.599 --> 01:07.668
has an exercise video
coming out.

01:10.771 --> 01:12.306
They're opening
a new pool at the gym, Will.

01:12.406 --> 01:13.774
Come on,
you should come with.

01:13.874 --> 01:15.075
It's full of cuties.

01:15.176 --> 01:17.211
It's like
a hot guy soup.

01:19.213 --> 01:21.715
Well, except
between 12:00 and 1:00,

01:21.815 --> 01:25.085
when Paul Sorvino does laps.

01:25.186 --> 01:27.488
I don't really
like to swim.

01:27.588 --> 01:28.722
Ugh, I never
swim in pools.

01:28.822 --> 01:30.691
They're filled with pee.

01:30.791 --> 01:33.194
That's ridiculous.

01:33.294 --> 01:34.328
It's an adult gym.

01:34.428 --> 01:35.463
Adults don't
pee in the pool.

01:35.563 --> 01:38.132
Okay.

01:39.367 --> 01:40.334
Come on, Will,
it'll be fun.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.803
I don't want to, okay?

01:42.903 --> 01:45.273
Wait a minute...

01:45.373 --> 01:47.341
I've known you
for 17 years.

01:47.441 --> 01:49.510
I don't think
I've ever seen you swim.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.545
I don't think I've ever
seen you swim either.

01:51.645 --> 01:54.648
Oh, my God.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.717
It's no big deal, okay?
I just never learned--

01:56.817 --> 01:57.818
You've got a hairpiece!

01:57.918 --> 01:58.852
Ow!

02:01.289 --> 02:03.457
I don't know how
to swim, okay?

02:03.557 --> 02:05.493
How...

02:05.593 --> 02:07.628
How do I not know that?

02:09.730 --> 02:11.899
I had a traumatic experience
when I was a kid.

02:11.999 --> 02:13.133
I fell in the
neighbor's pool.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.468
And my mom

02:14.568 --> 02:16.170
couldn't jump in, 'cause...

02:16.270 --> 02:17.905
'Cause she just
got her hair done.

02:18.005 --> 02:19.407
So she stuck out her foot

02:19.507 --> 02:21.475
but her mule
came off in my hand.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.177
Finally, she leaned over
to pull me out,

02:23.277 --> 02:24.245
spilled her Manhattan
in my eyes,

02:24.345 --> 02:25.579
and said,
"Oh, I give up."

02:29.617 --> 02:31.819
William Truman!

02:31.919 --> 02:35.623
You are a 57-year-old man.

02:35.723 --> 02:36.824
You should learn to swim.

02:39.727 --> 02:41.795
You know what?
I should.

02:41.895 --> 02:43.831
You're right,
it's the time in my life

02:43.931 --> 02:44.932
where I should be
facing up to my fears.

02:45.032 --> 02:46.300
I'm gonna swim,

02:46.400 --> 02:48.202
I'm gonna drink
out a public fountain,

02:48.302 --> 02:51.205
and I'm gonna read
an Ethan Hawke novel.

02:51.305 --> 02:54.908
Hey, Jay.
Hey, Wag.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.310
Wag?

02:56.410 --> 02:59.547
Will and Grace.
WAG.

02:59.647 --> 03:03.284
Just glad my name
isn't Frank.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.221
So, honey, guess what?

03:07.321 --> 03:09.657
I am setting you up
on a blind date

03:09.757 --> 03:10.558
with me and Malcolm.

03:10.658 --> 03:13.927
So, shave
what needs shaving and...

03:14.027 --> 03:15.396
boil the rest.

03:18.566 --> 03:21.335
I'm not really interested
in a blind date.

03:21.435 --> 03:23.304
Come on, honey,
it could be so much fun.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.239
You should go, Grace.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.608
It'd be good for you
to go out with a guy

03:27.708 --> 03:29.543
who could curl your toes
instead of your hair.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.745
You know what?
I should.

03:31.845 --> 03:36.317
I need some space
from you gays.

03:36.417 --> 03:38.519
Come on, Will,
we're shaving my legs.

03:39.520 --> 03:40.721
(Karen)
Yay!

03:40.821 --> 03:43.824
This is gonna make
my boyfriend so happy!

03:43.924 --> 03:46.294
Aren't you a little mature
to be referring

03:46.394 --> 03:47.461
to someone as your boyfriend?

03:47.561 --> 03:49.930
At least I can swim,
jackass.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.619
(Karen)
Whoo!

04:11.719 --> 04:14.021
Mmmm!

04:18.392 --> 04:22.396
Their passion reminds me
of a poem I once wrote.

04:24.432 --> 04:25.566
It goes like this.

04:25.666 --> 04:27.801
A kiss is a key
to the soul.

04:27.901 --> 04:32.039
To the curious mind,
wonderful forever.

04:36.410 --> 04:39.279
Uh, a poem has to rhyme.

04:41.582 --> 04:45.619
Like, there once
was a man from Nantucket...

04:49.056 --> 04:53.861
Something, something,
something, suck it.

04:53.961 --> 04:57.030
So you kids
having a good time?

04:57.130 --> 04:59.800
Oh, Karen, hi.

04:59.900 --> 05:02.903
I didn't recognize you
without Malcolm's tongue

05:03.003 --> 05:04.972
punching through
the back of your head.

05:08.008 --> 05:11.945
Well, Grace, since you like
things that rhyme.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.714
Although you are
a lovely date,

05:13.814 --> 05:16.850
please excuse me
while I urinate.

05:21.021 --> 05:22.823
You know, Grace, I do hope
we're sitting

05:22.923 --> 05:25.593
in the smoking section
because the sparks are flying

05:25.693 --> 05:27.761
between you and the D man.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.467
Swimming fact,
Speedo is French

05:33.567 --> 05:35.703
for maximum package exposure.

05:39.072 --> 05:41.975
So, uh, where's
my swimming instructor?

05:42.075 --> 05:44.378
Uh, I'll give you
a hint.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.947
He's the sexiest guy
in the room.

05:47.047 --> 05:50.884
Okay?
And it's me, all right?

05:50.984 --> 05:52.686
Oh!

05:52.786 --> 05:54.555
See you later.

05:54.655 --> 05:55.923
Wait a minute,
where are you going?

05:56.023 --> 05:57.858
I'm not letting you
teach me how to swim!

05:57.958 --> 06:00.661
I'd sooner catch a ride home
with Billy Joel!

06:02.463 --> 06:04.031
Will, I can teach you.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.699
Just like I taught you how
to trim around your nipples

06:05.799 --> 06:07.601
so your hair doesn't look like
crazy eyelashes.

06:11.505 --> 06:14.107
Yeah, after you put
mascara on them.

06:15.909 --> 06:18.145
Did they or did they not pop?

06:18.245 --> 06:19.413
Come on, Will.

06:19.513 --> 06:21.915
You said you wanted to learn.

06:23.551 --> 06:24.952
All right, I'll do it.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.754
But promise me you will not
make me look stupid.

06:26.854 --> 06:29.857
(Jack)
And jump and jump and down.

06:29.957 --> 06:32.993
And jump and jump and down.

06:33.093 --> 06:35.128
And jump and jump and down.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.900
Now that is a heck
of a scallop.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.835
Boy, it's so nice
to be eating with a fork

06:41.935 --> 06:44.805
rather than jamming it
into some guy's neck.

06:48.108 --> 06:49.543
I'm kidding!

06:49.643 --> 06:50.911
I'm a government accountant.

06:51.011 --> 06:52.946
Why would I kill that guy
in Budapest?

06:55.949 --> 06:59.086
You know, I like
having a couple friend.

06:59.186 --> 07:00.721
Let's do this every Friday.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.022
It'll be our thing.

07:03.123 --> 07:05.993
I'm sure that traffic school
can get along without me.

07:06.093 --> 07:09.463
Well, there's just
two little problems with that.

07:09.563 --> 07:11.098
Um, first, it's Tuesday.

07:12.700 --> 07:17.204
And second, I would hardly
call Dale and I a couple.

07:17.304 --> 07:19.006
Yeah, Grace hardly knows me.

07:19.106 --> 07:22.009
Oh, that's because
you're too modest.

07:22.109 --> 07:25.012
If I were compiling
a CIA file on Dale,

07:25.112 --> 07:27.781
and I'm not,

07:27.881 --> 07:30.017
the first page would read
that Dale is a piano tuner

07:30.117 --> 07:32.586
with a nifty rent-controlled
apartment in Staten Island.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.488
And from a distance
of two blocks, naked,

07:34.588 --> 07:37.124
he resembles
a young Charles Bronson.

07:39.527 --> 07:42.095
Um, Karen would you mind

07:42.195 --> 07:43.964
coming to
the ladies' room with me?

07:44.064 --> 07:44.965
Oh, honey, I don't
really have to--

07:45.065 --> 07:47.067
You do now.
Excuse us.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.802
Grace, what are you...

07:48.902 --> 07:49.903
Hey, you're right.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.505
Maybe I could make
a little sissy.

07:53.841 --> 07:56.844
Get over here.

07:56.944 --> 07:59.947
How could you think
that this guy is right for me?

08:00.047 --> 08:01.582
What's wrong with him?

08:01.682 --> 08:03.083
He's totally
wrong for me.

08:03.183 --> 08:06.086
Okay, Grace.

08:06.186 --> 08:10.123
I am gonna tell you something
that I was saving

08:10.223 --> 08:12.225
for your eulogy.

08:17.030 --> 08:21.735
You are a snob.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.605
I am not a snob.
How could you say that?

08:24.705 --> 08:25.973
Every guy
has a chance with me.

08:26.073 --> 08:28.709
The unattractive,
the unemployed,

08:28.809 --> 08:32.646
the "Lives with mom."

08:32.746 --> 08:35.215
Everyone's welcome.

08:36.083 --> 08:37.785
All right.

08:37.885 --> 08:40.120
Well, all I saw was a snob
sitting there

08:40.220 --> 08:41.589
with a vinegar puss

08:42.656 --> 08:44.892
acting like nothing he said
was good enough for her.

08:44.992 --> 08:49.062
Honestly, Grace, I thought
you were better than that.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.163
(Malcolm)
Girls?

08:50.263 --> 08:53.166
D-train here
has a great idea.

08:53.266 --> 08:54.902
Dinner tomorrow night

08:55.002 --> 08:56.704
at his place
on Staten Island.

08:56.804 --> 08:59.539
The "Riviera"
of New York Harbor.

08:59.640 --> 09:00.741
Did you know
the Richmond Hill landfill

09:01.742 --> 09:03.210
is the highest elevation
on the Eastern Seaboard?

09:03.310 --> 09:05.946
Yeah, you can see it
from my living room window.

09:07.347 --> 09:10.684
Well, I think
it sounds fantastic.

09:10.784 --> 09:13.086
But I don't know
if Princess Grace over here

09:13.186 --> 09:16.323
will be up for dinner
at a landfill.

09:16.423 --> 09:19.159
Actually, it sounds
wonderful.

09:19.259 --> 09:23.030
I love a good meal,
and I love a good dump.

09:26.199 --> 09:28.135
Okay, now,
let go of the wall

09:28.235 --> 09:30.604
and lean back
and I'll support you.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.205
You sure you got me?

09:32.305 --> 09:33.741
Yes, I got one hand
on your head

09:33.841 --> 09:37.611
and the other on your
upper ass beard.

09:37.711 --> 09:39.312
Okay.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.313
Wait, wait,
where are you hands?

09:40.413 --> 09:41.615
I can't feel 'em.

09:41.715 --> 09:42.883
They're right here.
Put 'em back!

09:42.983 --> 09:45.118
Will, what is your problem?

09:45.218 --> 09:48.756
Nothing.
I'm fine.

09:48.856 --> 09:51.191
I just want--I just want
to go home.

09:51.291 --> 09:53.627
And I think
I swallowed a band aid.

09:55.095 --> 09:59.933
Will, you're being ridiculous!

10:00.033 --> 10:02.135
Where's my band aid?

10:08.408 --> 10:11.845
Well, someone made a scene
at the pool today.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.247
I was upset.

10:14.347 --> 10:15.816
No, I'm talking about me.

10:15.916 --> 10:17.751
After you left
I jumped in the pool

10:17.851 --> 10:18.952
without looking
and ended up

10:19.052 --> 10:21.221
riding Paul Sorvino
for half a lap.

10:24.024 --> 10:26.159
Are you okay?
You left kinda fast.

10:26.259 --> 10:28.128
I'm fine.
I was just scared.

10:28.228 --> 10:29.930
Well, you're gonna
do better tomorrow.

10:30.030 --> 10:32.766
I got us access
to the kickboard shed.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.234
Don't even ask me

10:34.334 --> 10:36.670
how I pulled that off.

10:36.770 --> 10:38.238
Let's just say I had to
pull something off.

10:38.338 --> 10:40.373
Bathing suit.

10:41.842 --> 10:43.076
Yeah, you know what?

10:43.176 --> 10:45.979
Actually, I decided
I don't wanna learn to swim.

10:46.079 --> 10:47.014
What?
[phone ringing]

10:47.114 --> 10:48.081
Oh, don't answer that.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.783
That might be
the kickboard guy.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.251
I gave him your number 'cause
he sounded kinda dangerous,

10:51.351 --> 10:53.787
but I didn't wanna be rude.

10:53.887 --> 10:56.023
[phone ringing]

10:56.123 --> 10:57.057
(outgoing message)
It's Will.
And Grace.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.226
You can call us Wag.
Get it?

10:59.326 --> 11:00.761
Leave a message.
[beep]

11:00.861 --> 11:02.262
I decided it was cute.

11:02.362 --> 11:04.164
It's not.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.234
(message)
Hi, Will,
this is Adam from the pool.

11:07.334 --> 11:08.401
Just wanted to confirm
our lesson

11:08.501 --> 11:10.170
for 6:00 tomorrow.

11:13.473 --> 11:15.809
Wait a minute,
what was that?

11:15.909 --> 11:16.910
I thought you said
you were done with swimming.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.178
I know I just said that,
but--

11:18.278 --> 11:22.315
You said you didn't
wanna take any more lessons.

11:22.415 --> 11:24.384
Or you didn't wanna
take them from me.

11:24.484 --> 11:26.219
Jack...
You don't trust me.

11:26.319 --> 11:29.189
Look, you're my best friend
and I love you.

11:29.289 --> 11:30.958
But you're not exactly
reliable.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.459
I mean, I wanna learn
from someone that I know

11:32.559 --> 11:34.294
is gonna be there
to pull me out of the pool.

11:34.394 --> 11:36.029
Not someone that puts
diving rings around his neck

11:36.129 --> 11:37.898
and pretends
he's a woman from Kenya.

11:42.936 --> 11:44.204
But how could you think
I would ever

11:44.304 --> 11:46.206
let anything bad
happen to you?

11:46.306 --> 11:48.008
Jack, I do trust you.

11:48.108 --> 11:50.310
Just not with
the big things.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.712
You know,
it's a real shame, Will.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.314
Because you trusted me
with the biggest thing

11:54.414 --> 11:56.316
in your life and I didn't
let you down then.

11:56.416 --> 11:57.885
What are you talking about?

11:57.985 --> 12:01.254
You were terrified
to come out of the closet.

12:01.354 --> 12:02.856
And who was the one
who held your hand,

12:02.956 --> 12:04.391
fixed your hair,
and promised you

12:04.491 --> 12:05.725
everything was gonna
be okay?

12:06.827 --> 12:07.828
You.

12:07.928 --> 12:09.029
Yeah, that's right.

12:13.566 --> 12:14.868
Hey, Grace.
Hey.

12:14.968 --> 12:16.336
You're the first one here.

12:16.436 --> 12:17.871
Oh, Karen and Malcolm
aren't here?

12:17.971 --> 12:19.807
Did they call?
Are they close?

12:19.907 --> 12:21.241
Yeah, any minute.

12:21.341 --> 12:23.944
Oh, well,
we're fine alone.

12:24.044 --> 12:25.745
Did you hear
a car door slam?

12:28.481 --> 12:33.253
Oh, oh, and--wow,
there's the landfill.

12:33.353 --> 12:35.222
It's very...

12:35.322 --> 12:38.992
It's very beautiful
all lit up.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.427
It's not lit up.

12:40.527 --> 12:44.064
The hot part just broke
through the retardant foam.

12:46.033 --> 12:47.034
Neat.

12:48.535 --> 12:51.805
Pretty sure I didn't
wanna have kids anyway.

12:53.206 --> 12:54.407
I'm really happy
you're here, Grace.

12:55.575 --> 12:56.509
I've been looking forward
to this all day.

12:56.543 --> 12:57.811
Oh, me too.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.212
Can you just tell me
when it's 8:30?

12:59.312 --> 13:01.048
'Cause I have to
be home by 9:00.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.317
For what?

13:05.318 --> 13:07.420
Oh, I have a sick rabbit.

13:09.256 --> 13:13.193
I've gotta put drops
in his ears

13:13.293 --> 13:15.328
every five hours.

13:15.428 --> 13:22.269
You know,
and I just did it at...

13:22.369 --> 13:23.570
4:00?

13:23.670 --> 13:25.105
[knocking at door]

13:25.205 --> 13:27.941
That's Malcolm and Karen.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.242
Oh, darn it.

13:29.342 --> 13:30.410
I was gonna
lay some plastic

13:30.510 --> 13:31.344
down on the couch.

13:34.247 --> 13:37.350
You are chewing
on my last nerve, froggy!

13:37.450 --> 13:39.419
You are eight feet
of pain in the ass

13:39.519 --> 13:42.022
stuffed into
a four-foot stack.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.261
How hard is it
to read a map?

13:48.361 --> 13:49.362
I don't need
a freakin' map

13:49.462 --> 13:50.931
to get to Staten Island!

13:51.031 --> 13:54.067
I think I've done that
a few hundred times!

13:54.167 --> 13:55.502
You take the Lincoln Tunnel
to the turnpike,

13:55.602 --> 13:57.905
hit the Verrazano,
get off at exit 11,

13:58.005 --> 14:01.508
and go straight
to Victory Boulevard.

14:01.608 --> 14:04.912
That's if you wanna go
through New Jersey, dumbbell.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.346
Hi, Grace.
Nice eye shadow.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.516
I'm not gonna drive
all the way to Staten Island

14:09.616 --> 14:11.384
without picking up
some sweet Jersey cider,

14:11.484 --> 14:16.123
you slack-jawed
Irish moose!

14:16.223 --> 14:18.591
Hey, Dale.
Baked you a pumpkin loaf.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.193
Oh, thanks.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.861
Man, am I steamed.
I'm going for a walk.

14:21.962 --> 14:23.496
I'm going
for a walk too.

14:23.596 --> 14:25.198
And don't you dare
take Gnome Avenue!

14:25.298 --> 14:28.235
Because I am going there,
taking a left on Lewiston,

14:28.335 --> 14:29.869
a sharp right on Richmond,

14:29.970 --> 14:32.139
and then it dead ends
at Fiorelli's Pizza.

14:32.239 --> 14:34.507
(Malcolm)
It's not a dead end,
it's a T!

14:36.576 --> 14:38.045
Wow.

14:38.145 --> 14:39.279
I didn't have the heart
to tell her

14:39.379 --> 14:42.215
that Fiorelli's closed down
and that area

14:42.315 --> 14:43.350
is now pretty "gangy."

14:43.450 --> 14:44.952
Oh.
[laughing]

14:47.054 --> 14:49.489
Oh, my God,
I just realized.

14:49.589 --> 14:52.059
This is a peace sign.
Yeah.

14:52.159 --> 14:53.093
Wow.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.327
That is a really good chair.

14:54.427 --> 14:55.395
Where did you get it?

14:55.495 --> 14:57.064
Amsterdam.

14:57.164 --> 14:58.631
Yeah, I love to travel.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.434
Although I usually
spend all my time

15:01.534 --> 15:05.405
in the hotel watching TV
and ordering room service.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.374
Well, yeah.

15:09.442 --> 15:12.345
Why else go
to foreign countries?

15:12.445 --> 15:14.514
So you can watch MTV
in funny languages

15:14.614 --> 15:17.184
and see what
their coke tastes like.

15:17.284 --> 15:20.553
I thought I was
the only one who did that.

15:20.653 --> 15:25.125
No, I'm a huge coke fiend.

15:30.998 --> 15:33.133
You know, Grace...

15:33.233 --> 15:35.035
there is a good chance
that they're not gonna

15:35.135 --> 15:36.936
make it back alive.

15:37.037 --> 15:38.705
So, uh...

15:38.805 --> 15:41.708
if you wanna go,
there's no hard feelings.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.046
You know what?

15:46.146 --> 15:49.449
Um, I'd like to stay
if that's okay.

15:49.549 --> 15:52.585
I wish you would.

15:52.685 --> 15:55.355
'Cause I made...fould.

15:58.458 --> 15:59.492
I was trying
to make it rhyme.

16:06.533 --> 16:09.069
Oh, well look who it is.

16:09.169 --> 16:14.541
Mark Spitz in my face.

16:14.641 --> 16:16.576
You here to meet
your new instructor?

16:16.676 --> 16:17.577
I am, actually.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.046
I'm really excited.

16:19.146 --> 16:21.048
He's really good looking,
a great teacher.

16:21.148 --> 16:23.250
And I trust him
with my life.

16:23.350 --> 16:26.219
Well, where is he?
I'd like to meet him.

16:26.319 --> 16:27.987
I'm standing with him
right now.

16:29.356 --> 16:32.092
I'm not stupid, Will.
You're alone.

16:35.262 --> 16:36.663
It's you, Jack.

16:36.763 --> 16:38.998
I'm so sorry
about what I said.

16:39.099 --> 16:40.667
I was dead wrong.

16:40.767 --> 16:41.668
Really?

16:41.768 --> 16:43.303
Yes.

16:43.403 --> 16:46.206
You've been saving my life
since the day I met you.

16:46.306 --> 16:47.607
And I don't know how
I missed that.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.008
I don't either.

16:49.109 --> 16:51.144
It's clear as the face
around your mole.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.014
Can I get
another lesson?

16:55.115 --> 16:58.785
Sure, let's go.

16:58.885 --> 17:02.021
(Grace)
Oh, my God.
This was so delicious.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.656
I've been living
with a gay guy for so long,

17:03.756 --> 17:08.495
I forgot what the skin
of a chicken tastes like.

17:08.595 --> 17:09.696
Thank you.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.665
Yeah, once I took
the skin off a raw chicken

17:12.765 --> 17:14.767
and I rolled it
in butter and breadcrumbs,

17:14.867 --> 17:19.072
fried it up and ate it
alone in my bathroom.

17:19.172 --> 17:22.109
Mister, I could really
fall for you.

17:23.576 --> 17:25.612
[both laughing]

17:25.712 --> 17:27.147
Hey, you two!

17:27.247 --> 17:28.648
We are back!

17:28.748 --> 17:30.683
And I love this girl.

17:30.783 --> 17:33.786
And I wuv this guy.
Beep.

17:33.886 --> 17:34.821
Funniest darn thing.

17:34.921 --> 17:36.589
You know, the two of us,
we're stubborn as mules.

17:36.689 --> 17:38.325
So when we leave
this apartment,

17:38.425 --> 17:39.659
we both make a beeline
for Fiorelli's.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.595
Turns out it's now
a burned-out building

17:42.695 --> 17:44.664
that's very important
to the Latin Kings.

17:44.764 --> 17:45.532
Yeah.

17:48.735 --> 17:50.203
So she looks at me,
I look at her.

17:50.303 --> 17:52.172
The Latin Kings
look at us.

17:52.272 --> 17:53.540
And I tuck her under my arm
and off we go.

17:53.640 --> 17:56.776
Now, I told him
to go down Arden Street.

17:56.876 --> 17:58.711
And I'm thinking
McKinley must be quicker.

17:58.811 --> 18:01.614
But, I bite my tongue
and wouldn't you know,

18:01.714 --> 18:03.616
she was right.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.385
Let's never fight again.

18:05.485 --> 18:07.154
Make that a promise, baby.

18:09.756 --> 18:10.790
Dale, you got any Orangina?

18:10.890 --> 18:13.560
I'm kind of
in that mood.

18:13.660 --> 18:15.162
Uh, yeah.

18:15.262 --> 18:16.696
Except I don't
have any ice.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.665
The water here
doesn't freeze.

18:18.765 --> 18:23.670
Although it fills you up
like a bucket of KFC.

18:25.405 --> 18:27.540
Ah, great night,
huh, honey?

18:27.640 --> 18:30.610
You know, I'm having
a really good time.

18:31.711 --> 18:34.614
I was being a snob.

18:34.714 --> 18:40.553
Dale is funny and sweet
and he cooks with real butter.

18:40.653 --> 18:43.256
And I think I'm going to
see him again.

18:43.356 --> 18:44.791
I'm proud of you, Grace.

18:46.459 --> 18:47.827
Hey, Grace.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.196
Nice eye shadow.

18:49.296 --> 18:50.563
Did you ever hear Dale
play the piano?

18:50.663 --> 18:51.564
Uh, no.
No, I haven't.

18:51.664 --> 18:52.765
Dale?

18:53.766 --> 18:55.168
It's not--it isn't
gonna be classical, is it?

18:55.268 --> 18:56.703
Oh, God, no.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.238
Strictly show tunes
and top 20.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.640
Yeeee!

19:02.809 --> 19:06.579
Oh, I love this song.

19:11.718 --> 19:15.522
[singing badly]
* Someone to hold me
too close *

19:15.622 --> 19:16.723
* Someone to hurt me

19:16.823 --> 19:20.460
* Too deep

19:20.560 --> 19:21.894
* Someone to sit
in my chair *

19:21.994 --> 19:24.364
* And ruin my sleep

19:24.464 --> 19:29.436
* And make me aware
of being alive *

19:29.536 --> 19:32.805
* Being alive

19:32.905 --> 19:35.808
* Beeeiiinng *--What?

19:35.908 --> 19:37.777
Ah, I just
noticed the time.

19:37.877 --> 19:40.380
It's getting pretty late.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.748
It's 8:30.

19:41.848 --> 19:45.652
Yeah, I was kind of hoping
to be in bed by 9:00.

19:45.752 --> 19:50.423
Wait a minute,
is this because of my singing?

19:50.523 --> 19:52.659
Because...you live
in Staten Island.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.294
On a landfill.

19:54.394 --> 19:58.665
You know, I've learned
to live with the smell.

19:58.765 --> 20:01.401
But I'll never get that sound
out of my ears.

20:04.804 --> 20:09.276
You...you are a snob.

20:15.615 --> 20:16.749
And I can too sing.

20:19.752 --> 20:23.690
[singing badly]
* Isn't it rich

20:23.790 --> 20:28.795
* Aren't we a pair

20:28.895 --> 20:30.997
I'm sorry, Dale,
I had no idea.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.869
Well, this has been
such fun.

20:36.969 --> 20:38.705
Malcolm, darling,
would you please

20:38.805 --> 20:39.972
turn the car around?

20:40.072 --> 20:41.674
Why?
We're turning left on Richmond.

20:41.774 --> 20:42.875
We're turning right!

20:47.046 --> 20:48.448
You know,
this is the deep end.

20:48.548 --> 20:51.618
I know.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.820
You'll be there.
Okay.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.990
One, two...

20:58.090 --> 20:59.726
Jump!

21:02.962 --> 21:05.898
See, Will,
that wasn't so bad.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.033
Oh, look, you've already
taught yourself

21:07.133 --> 21:09.336
the dead man's float!

21:09.436 --> 21:10.670
Ooh.

21:10.770 --> 21:10.870
