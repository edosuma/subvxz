00:45.170 --> 00:46.713
How's it coming?

00:47.881 --> 00:50.091
Very, very well.

00:50.467 --> 00:53.261
It's a flurry of deliveries.

00:53.429 --> 00:56.305
Feels like Christmas morning.

00:57.349 --> 00:59.183
It's exciting.

00:59.852 --> 01:02.979
It's really coming together.
And I'd like to point out...

01:03.147 --> 01:05.940
...that if you have
any understandable questions...

01:06.108 --> 01:08.151
...about the price tag...

01:10.446 --> 01:12.780
That sound? Quality.

01:12.948 --> 01:17.535
At Pfizer, at Merck,
that unit would be right at home.

01:17.703 --> 01:19.245
That goes for all of it.

01:20.956 --> 01:23.833
Good. I want you
to have what you need.

01:24.710 --> 01:28.713
Well, I doff my proverbial cap
to you, sir.

01:28.881 --> 01:31.132
When do you think
we'll be up and running?

01:31.300 --> 01:32.633
Within a month, I'd say.

01:33.719 --> 01:35.511
Two weeks.

01:36.597 --> 01:40.725
Or, yeah, two weeks.

01:40.893 --> 01:42.852
Good. Very good.

01:43.020 --> 01:46.606
By the way,
that sample you asked me to run?

01:46.774 --> 01:52.653
- I ran it, and it is quite good.
- Thank you very much, Gale.

01:52.821 --> 01:55.782
- You can give that to Victor to discard.
- Sure.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.493
Is that our competition?

01:58.660 --> 02:01.370
- I'm sorry?
- The...

02:01.622 --> 02:03.623
it really is quite good.

02:03.791 --> 02:08.085
The purity, of course, I'm speaking of,
speaking strictly in chemical terms.

02:08.377 --> 02:12.548
And I can't, as of yet,
account for the blue color...

02:13.592 --> 02:16.135
...but if that is our competition...

02:16.303 --> 02:19.639
...we have our work cut out for us,
so to speak.

02:19.807 --> 02:23.768
You don't have any competition, Gale,
not as far as I'm concerned.

02:23.936 --> 02:27.522
After all, how pure can pure be?

02:28.524 --> 02:32.026
Well, it can be pretty darn pure.

02:32.903 --> 02:38.366
Mr. Fring, I can guarantee you
a purity of 96 percent.

02:38.534 --> 02:42.495
I'm proud of that figure.
It's a hard-earned figure, 96.

02:42.663 --> 02:46.082
However, this other product is 99.

02:46.625 --> 02:49.544
Maybe even a touch beyond that.

02:49.711 --> 02:53.005
I'd need an instrument
called a gas chromatograph...

02:53.173 --> 02:54.549
...to say for sure...

02:54.716 --> 02:57.927
...but that last 3 percent...

02:58.095 --> 03:02.306
...it may not sound like a lot,
but it is.

03:02.474 --> 03:04.475
It's tremendous.

03:04.643 --> 03:08.479
It's a tremendous gulf.

03:08.647 --> 03:14.318
Gale, for our purposes,
96 percent will do just fine.

03:14.486 --> 03:17.572
Please, don't let this trouble you.

03:17.739 --> 03:21.200
Yeah. it's just...

03:21.743 --> 03:26.038
I'd love to know
who synthesized it, is all.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.835
A man who wants to work with me.

03:31.003 --> 03:33.045
A trained chemist, like yourself.

03:33.672 --> 03:35.631
But it won't happen.

03:35.841 --> 03:38.134
I don't consider him a professional.

03:39.303 --> 03:44.181
If he's not,
I don't know what that makes me.

03:44.933 --> 03:47.351
I'm not trying
to talk myself out of a job...

03:47.519 --> 03:50.938
With this person,
there are other considerations.

03:51.982 --> 03:55.776
His is the best I've ever seen,
hands down.

03:57.863 --> 04:00.948
And I look at this place
that you've built...

04:01.116 --> 04:03.409
...the money you're investing...

04:06.371 --> 04:08.456
And I know...

04:11.209 --> 04:14.795
...I know that you want the best.

05:12.521 --> 05:15.940
6353 Juan Tabo. Apartment 6.

05:17.401 --> 05:18.651
No, no. Eubank's west.

05:18.819 --> 05:22.697
It's between Eubank and Spain,
but Mazatlan's closest.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.117
I don't know. I just heard the one...

05:26.284 --> 05:29.036
...like, you know, a backfire,
a truck backfiring.

05:29.204 --> 05:31.789
I came out of my apartment.
A couple came out.

05:31.957 --> 05:33.749
No. No, nobody saw.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.419
Did you guys see anybody?

05:36.586 --> 05:39.922
Guys, did you...? I don't know
if they speak English too good.

05:40.090 --> 05:42.258
I don't think they saw anybody.

05:42.426 --> 05:46.095
It was just this one loud...
This very loud pop and that was all.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.848
No arguing or like that.

05:49.975 --> 05:53.477
So you guys good in directions there?
You want me to...?

05:54.396 --> 05:57.023
They coming east or west?

05:57.357 --> 06:01.777
If heading east, tell them there's
an Exxon on their left-hand side.

06:01.945 --> 06:05.573
Then it's straight residential.
You want me to what? Yeah.

06:05.741 --> 06:07.992
No. I'll stay on the line.

06:12.497 --> 06:13.914
You know him?

06:14.082 --> 06:17.668
We all heard this shot.
I don't think you ought to go in there.

06:17.836 --> 06:21.338
Mister, this is a crime scene.
You don't wanna touch anything.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.174
Mister?

06:25.093 --> 06:27.678
Mister, are you listening to me?

06:45.155 --> 06:47.281
Little bastard.

06:49.409 --> 06:53.245
Drive.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.217
What the hell happened?

08:31.553 --> 08:32.595
He's gone?

08:34.054 --> 08:35.931
Look at me.

08:36.224 --> 08:37.808
Gone?

08:37.976 --> 08:39.602
You sure?

08:39.769 --> 08:44.063
- Gone. Splattered all over.
- Oh, Jesus.

08:44.399 --> 08:47.151
Jesus. Oh, shit.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.572
All right.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.908
So...

08:54.117 --> 08:55.492
Shit.

08:56.745 --> 09:00.039
- All right, you do a sweep?
- Couldn't. People there.

09:01.333 --> 09:05.211
People? He get himself seen
by these people?

09:05.545 --> 09:11.091
What about you?

09:11.259 --> 09:13.552
Yeah. So what?

09:14.930 --> 09:17.473
Just another looky-loo.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.695
I guess I'd better get this over with.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.809
Hey.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.937
Oh, jeez, I woke you up.
I woke you up.

10:05.105 --> 10:08.065
No, no, no, it's okay.
I needed to get up anyway.

10:08.608 --> 10:09.775
Are you coming in?

10:09.943 --> 10:12.403
No. it's kind of my only time
to run errands.

10:12.570 --> 10:14.029
I just needed to...

10:16.992 --> 10:18.534
I...

10:19.619 --> 10:21.495
Sorry.

10:21.663 --> 10:22.913
It's okay.

10:23.081 --> 10:28.002
And thank you, big time, as always.

10:29.004 --> 10:32.381
They seem to be getting bigger
instead of smaller.

10:32.549 --> 10:35.759
Not really sure what that's all about.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.387
Please, for God's sake...

10:38.555 --> 10:41.432
...tell me if this is getting
to be too much for you.

10:41.599 --> 10:44.184
Absolutely not, okay?
It's absolutely fine.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.145
Okay.

10:50.150 --> 10:52.943
Does this mean
what I think it means?

10:54.696 --> 10:57.114
- What?
- You and walt?

10:58.241 --> 10:59.450
What?

10:59.617 --> 11:02.578
His car is in the driveway.
It's not a state secret.

11:02.746 --> 11:06.999
L... All right. Okay. I'm not pressing.
I just...

11:07.250 --> 11:09.335
I think that it's great.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.420
That's all, all right?

11:11.588 --> 11:13.088
- I'm out of here.
- Okay.

11:13.256 --> 11:18.510
Oh, hey. A big howdy-do
to Mr. I'm-Not-Here.

12:28.832 --> 12:30.207
...In Albuquerque today.

12:30.375 --> 12:34.461
But you know what? it always is when
you have 330 days of sunshine a year.

12:45.306 --> 12:47.266
On morning commute,
northbound 25...

12:47.434 --> 12:50.352
...we've got a two-car accident
on the right shoulder.

12:50.520 --> 12:53.397
You gotta be careful.
Also, from the west side...

12:53.565 --> 12:57.359
...we've got another accident,
Paseo del Norte and Second Street.

12:57.527 --> 13:00.612
That one's on the left shoulder,
so be on the lookout.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.949
That's a look at your morning commute
on Coyote 102.5

13:46.910 --> 13:48.869
Oh, hey.

13:49.037 --> 13:51.330
- Breakfast?
- Yeah.

13:51.498 --> 13:53.415
Yeah? Okay.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.340
All right. what you want?

14:25.323 --> 14:27.199
All right, look.

14:27.367 --> 14:30.661
So I make it 10 to 9, which means...

14:30.828 --> 14:33.914
Shut up.

14:36.251 --> 14:40.128
Which means we need to start a cook
in the next 10 minutes...

14:40.296 --> 14:41.838
...to keep to our schedule.

14:42.006 --> 14:44.675
Gus' schedule.

14:46.302 --> 14:49.596
And as angry as he may be,
I don't believe he's willing...

14:49.764 --> 14:51.431
...to forfeit an entire batch.

14:51.599 --> 14:54.393
That just might make him angrier.

14:57.355 --> 15:00.107
Come on, Mike. Let us cook.

15:00.275 --> 15:03.110
Isn't that
what this whole thing is about?

16:13.848 --> 16:16.975
That's right, genius. Watch me.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.895
We ain't missing no cook.

16:44.545 --> 16:46.838
We're closed.

16:47.965 --> 16:49.257
Closed.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.924
Saul Goodman and Associates.

17:31.092 --> 17:33.927
I'll see if he's in. Please hold.

17:35.888 --> 17:38.974
Saul, Skyler White calling.

17:41.519 --> 17:43.353
Saul.

17:57.535 --> 17:59.995
Saul, Skyler White on the line.

18:00.955 --> 18:03.165
- Saul.
- Hey.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.459
Skyler white.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.420
What the hell does she want?

18:15.762 --> 18:17.137
He's nowhere to be found.

18:17.305 --> 18:19.514
I called his condo,
every number I have.

18:19.682 --> 18:21.183
Yeah, I'm sure he's fine.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.185
You're sure?

18:23.352 --> 18:25.729
As in, you know where he is?

18:27.106 --> 18:30.484
I'm not the man's keeper,
but Walt's a big boy. He'll turn up.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.527
Mr. Goodman,
something is going on.

18:32.695 --> 18:35.363
Why would he leave his car
in my driveway?

18:35.531 --> 18:38.867
People carpool to work, right?
It's good for the environment.

18:39.035 --> 18:42.579
He carpools?
He carpools to his job at a meth lab?

18:42.747 --> 18:45.415
Hey, you're breaking up there.

18:45.583 --> 18:48.293
I didn't quite catch that last...

18:48.461 --> 18:51.797
- You're a Chatty Cathy today.
- Okay, do you know anything?

18:51.964 --> 18:55.425
Anything at all?
Please, I'm looking for some help here.

18:55.593 --> 19:00.972
Look, Walter is fine, okay?
I guarantee that, hundred percent.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.226
One hundred percent.

19:09.106 --> 19:11.149
You got a passport, right?

19:53.526 --> 19:55.360
Yeah. Albuquerque.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.737
I'm in Nob Hill.

19:57.905 --> 20:00.740
I need the number for a locksmith.

20:00.950 --> 20:03.118
I don't know. Pick one.

20:03.286 --> 20:07.664
- You sure there's nothing?
- No, it's not even me. it's state law.

20:07.832 --> 20:10.750
Are you sure there isn't some sort of...?
I don't know.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.669
No. Nothing.

20:12.837 --> 20:16.172
Maybe a car registration.
That would have your address.

20:16.340 --> 20:20.802
No, but I can't even get in my car.
My car keys were on the same ring.

20:20.970 --> 20:24.055
My God, my credit cards, my...
it's all right, sweetheart.

20:24.223 --> 20:28.143
My driver's license, my checkbook.
I have to start canceling all that.

20:28.311 --> 20:32.564
My whole life was in that purse
and he just cut it right off my shoulder.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.399
We could've been stabbed.

20:34.567 --> 20:38.778
I'm sorry, really.
But without proof of residency...

20:38.946 --> 20:40.697
I can take you down to my shop.

20:40.865 --> 20:43.283
You're welcome to wait,
file a police report.

20:43.451 --> 20:46.786
I can't believe this.
I cannot believe this day.

20:46.954 --> 20:49.706
I know. it's just, it's the law.

20:49.874 --> 20:54.502
Oh, my God. My medication.
I bet it's gone.

20:56.589 --> 21:00.342
Oh, God, not now, not this.
Gotta call the pharmacy.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.177
Are you okay?

21:02.345 --> 21:06.473
Please, just... Please, just take her.
Please. Just take her, please.

21:08.225 --> 21:09.893
Oh, God.

21:10.061 --> 21:11.728
Not now.

21:11.896 --> 21:14.439
No. Not now.

21:21.030 --> 21:24.115
Oh, you're a lifesaver. Truly.

21:24.283 --> 21:27.410
Here you go, sweetheart.
Oh, there you go.

21:31.457 --> 21:34.501
How do you...?
How do you wanna deal with the bill?

21:34.669 --> 21:39.005
L... Unfortunately,
all my cash was taken so...

21:39.173 --> 21:43.635
- That's fine. We'll mail it to you.
- Will you? You know where I live, right?

21:43.803 --> 21:48.181
- Sir, again, thank you so much. Really.
- Yeah.

23:35.831 --> 23:38.875
Hey there. I'm back.

23:44.507 --> 23:46.549
How was PT?

23:48.135 --> 23:52.764
I heard it was very good.

23:53.766 --> 23:56.810
I'm really liking this new therapist.

23:56.977 --> 24:00.772
He keeps me in the loop,
always has time for a phone call. it's...

24:00.940 --> 24:02.649
I like it.

24:03.067 --> 24:05.068
So?

24:05.820 --> 24:07.904
Tell me all about it.

24:08.364 --> 24:11.116
I heard you broke new ground today.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.160
I broke new ground?

24:14.328 --> 24:17.372
That's what he said. Tell me.

24:21.293 --> 24:24.504
I walked 16 feet in 20 minutes...

24:24.672 --> 24:28.216
...which is up from
my 15 and a half yesterday.

24:28.384 --> 24:30.385
And this much less shit in my pants.

24:30.553 --> 24:35.056
So, yeah, Marie, if you and him and
everybody in America took a vote...

24:35.224 --> 24:37.892
...changed the meaning
of the English language...

24:38.060 --> 24:41.271
...yeah, I guess
I "broke new ground."

24:42.439 --> 24:49.529
Well, call it a figure of speech,
but I am seeing progress.

24:52.283 --> 24:54.617
Definite progress.

24:56.537 --> 24:58.496
You're ordering a new rock?

24:58.664 --> 25:01.541
I'm bidding on a new mineral.

25:03.252 --> 25:05.086
It's a nice one.

25:09.425 --> 25:11.467
What? it's pretty.

25:11.969 --> 25:13.636
I need the thing.

25:13.804 --> 25:15.404
Okay.

25:55.137 --> 25:59.933
It has all those pretty little crystals.
I like that.

26:01.310 --> 26:02.977
Okay.

26:24.375 --> 26:29.921
All right, I just wanna go on record,
we should all be wearing masks.

26:37.054 --> 26:39.138
We should be wearing masks.

26:55.197 --> 26:57.407
Bet he forgets the aluminum.

27:01.078 --> 27:03.037
Guaranteed.

27:03.580 --> 27:05.540
Guarantee he forgets.

27:11.213 --> 27:14.215
Oh, you don't know
what the hell you're doing, do you?

27:14.383 --> 27:16.426
You forgot the aluminum.

27:19.471 --> 27:22.265
One of the first steps in the...

27:28.439 --> 27:30.565
Son of a bitch.

29:18.674 --> 29:21.843
All right,
let's talk about Gale Boetticher.

29:22.386 --> 29:24.470
He was a good man
and a good chemist...

29:24.638 --> 29:26.556
...and I cared about him.

29:28.142 --> 29:30.810
He didn't deserve
what happened to him.

29:31.437 --> 29:33.771
He didn't deserve it at all.

29:35.899 --> 29:42.113
But I'd shoot him again tomorrow
and the next day and the day after that.

29:42.281 --> 29:46.993
When you make it Gale versus me,
or Gale versus Jesse...

29:47.161 --> 29:50.538
...Gale loses, simple as that.

29:55.377 --> 29:58.296
This is on you, Gus.
Not me, not Jesse.

29:58.464 --> 30:01.257
Gale's death is on you.

30:03.260 --> 30:05.803
I mean, really,
what did you expect me to do...

30:05.971 --> 30:10.308
...just simply roll over
and allow you to murder us?

30:11.351 --> 30:14.979
That I wouldn't take measures,
extreme measures to defend myself?

30:15.147 --> 30:16.272
Wrong.

30:18.025 --> 30:19.108
Think again.

30:19.276 --> 30:22.737
And whatever it is
you're planning there...

30:22.905 --> 30:26.449
...whatever it is, the point
that you're trying to make here...

30:26.617 --> 30:30.077
...let me suggest
that you keep one thing in mind.

30:30.621 --> 30:34.624
Without us,
without Jesse and myself...

30:35.167 --> 30:38.794
...you have no one
to make your product.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.964
Certainly not him.

30:43.091 --> 30:45.801
This person doesn't know
what the hell he's doing.

30:46.136 --> 30:49.847
Been watching him for weeks.
I know every step of his cook.

30:52.726 --> 30:55.144
Do you really? You?

30:59.775 --> 31:03.861
Really? Oh, so please tell me.

31:04.071 --> 31:09.033
Catalytic hydrogenation, is it protic
or aprotic? Because I forget.

31:09.201 --> 31:14.330
If our reduction isn't stereospecific
how can our product be pure?

31:14.498 --> 31:18.960
I mean, is 1 -phenyl-1 -hydroxy-
2-methylamino-propane...

31:19.127 --> 31:21.462
...containing, of course,
chiral centers...

31:21.630 --> 31:24.549
...at carbons number one and two
on the propane chain?

31:24.716 --> 31:26.884
Then reduction
to methamphetamine...

31:27.052 --> 31:30.555
...eliminates which chiral center
is it again?

31:30.722 --> 31:32.848
Because I forgot.

31:33.267 --> 31:36.477
Come on, help me out, professor.

31:36.645 --> 31:38.312
Gus.

31:38.772 --> 31:42.483
We're here. Come on. Let us work.

31:42.651 --> 31:46.320
All his bullshit aside,
it's called a cook.

31:46.488 --> 31:48.948
Everything comes down
to following a recipe.

31:49.116 --> 31:51.617
Simple, complicated,
it doesn't matter.

31:51.785 --> 31:54.245
The steps never change...

31:54.496 --> 31:56.539
...and I know every step.

31:56.707 --> 31:59.417
Oh, is that what you want?

31:59.876 --> 32:05.089
This short-order cook?
You're not flipping hamburgers.

32:05.257 --> 32:07.967
What happens
when you get bad barrel of precursor?

32:08.135 --> 32:09.677
How would you even know it?

32:09.845 --> 32:13.973
And what happens in the summer
when the humidity rises...

32:14.141 --> 32:16.809
...and your product goes cloudy?

32:17.644 --> 32:20.605
How would you
guard against that, huh?

32:20.772 --> 32:22.189
Gus.

32:23.275 --> 32:27.153
You do this, all you'll have left...

32:27.321 --> 32:30.615
...is an $8 million hole in the ground.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.617
This lab...

32:33.035 --> 32:35.286
...this equipment is useless
without us.

32:35.454 --> 32:39.707
Without Jesse and myself,
you have no new product.

32:39.875 --> 32:41.917
You have no income.

32:42.085 --> 32:46.297
Your people out there will not be paid.
Your distribution chain collapses.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.507
Without us...

32:48.967 --> 32:50.968
...you have nothing.

32:52.596 --> 32:55.640
You kill me, you have nothing.

32:56.475 --> 32:58.976
You kill Jesse, you don't have me.

33:13.617 --> 33:15.201
You won't do this.

33:16.411 --> 33:18.496
You're too smart.

33:19.623 --> 33:21.248
You can't afford to do this.

33:22.626 --> 33:24.251
Please.

33:26.380 --> 33:28.714
Let us just go back to work.

33:28.882 --> 33:30.591
We're here.

33:31.343 --> 33:35.012
Let us work.
We're ready to go to work.

33:35.514 --> 33:38.099
We'll just pick up
right where we left off.

37:10.520 --> 37:12.146
Well?

37:14.190 --> 37:16.150
Get back to work.

38:13.583 --> 38:17.086
Listen, we'll just lay this down.

38:17.253 --> 38:21.548
Put him in feet first. Grab his shoe.

38:22.092 --> 38:26.053
Here. wait, wait, wait.
Just lift him up. There. All right.

38:29.474 --> 38:31.976
Oh, God.

38:32.143 --> 38:34.603
You push that way, I'll hold him in.

38:36.314 --> 38:39.358
Okay, ready? One...

38:40.110 --> 38:41.860
Oh, shit.

38:43.113 --> 38:45.322
Wait, wait. wait.

38:46.866 --> 38:48.534
Forget that. Okay.

38:58.294 --> 39:00.671
Come on. Up.

39:05.385 --> 39:07.344
Get down.

39:08.388 --> 39:10.514
Okay, okay.

39:24.738 --> 39:27.865
I never use this stuff.
Are you sure it'll do the job?

39:28.908 --> 39:30.284
Trust us.

40:59.374 --> 41:02.042
Here you go, hon.
Get you anything else?

41:02.210 --> 41:04.044
No, I'm good. Thanks.

41:32.740 --> 41:34.199
How you doing?

41:37.412 --> 41:38.996
No, I mean, you know...

41:41.332 --> 41:43.458
...how are you doing?

41:50.842 --> 41:52.968
You did the only thing
that you could.

41:53.136 --> 41:55.137
I hope you understand that.

41:58.308 --> 42:00.309
Thoughts?

42:03.479 --> 42:07.941
Any thoughts
on what our next move might be?

42:08.401 --> 42:10.152
What next move?

42:10.653 --> 42:12.029
Our next move.

42:12.739 --> 42:18.493
Our next move, given the fact that at
the first opportunity, Gus will kill us.

42:18.661 --> 42:21.747
What, that wasn't an opportunity
just now?

42:22.040 --> 42:24.291
Seemed like a damn good opportunity
to me.

42:24.459 --> 42:26.752
- No, no.
- Golden, I would say.

42:26.920 --> 42:30.547
We bought ourselves some time,
yes, but...

42:31.257 --> 42:35.510
The question is how much.
He'll be looking for another chemist.

42:35.887 --> 42:38.513
He's not gonna find another chemist.

42:38.681 --> 42:41.225
Where is he gonna find
another chemist?

42:41.476 --> 42:45.437
It's not just about somebody
being able to run a lab that big.

42:45.605 --> 42:47.064
Someone he can trust...

42:47.232 --> 42:51.109
...someone he knows
will keep their mouths shut.

42:52.320 --> 42:54.863
Yeah. Good luck with that.

42:56.407 --> 43:00.077
Bet it took him years to find Gale.

43:01.412 --> 43:02.829
Bet he's sorry now.

43:12.006 --> 43:15.425
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Now we all understand each other.

43:15.593 --> 43:17.219
Right?

43:18.012 --> 43:22.891
- What do you mean?
- I mean, him and us, we get it.

43:29.857 --> 43:32.609
We're all on the same page.

43:35.780 --> 43:38.323
And what page is that?

43:39.117 --> 43:40.784
The one that says:

43:40.952 --> 43:43.245
"if I can't kill you...

43:43.454 --> 43:46.206
...you'll sure as shit wish
you were dead."

43:57.510 --> 44:00.095
Yo, excuse me.

44:01.889 --> 44:03.598
Thanks.

44:17.280 --> 44:20.490
- Here.
- Thank you, sir. Have a good one.

44:20.658 --> 44:22.326
Thanks.

44:41.429 --> 44:43.029
Hi.

44:48.686 --> 44:51.021
It's parked over on Amsden.

44:51.314 --> 44:54.316
Junior was about to get up
and he would've seen it...

44:54.484 --> 44:57.527
...so I wanted
to avoid a lot of questions.

44:58.446 --> 45:00.155
Smart.

45:01.199 --> 45:02.824
Well.

45:04.660 --> 45:05.702
Kenny Rogers.

45:07.997 --> 45:09.748
Yeah.

45:11.959 --> 45:13.877
You okay?

45:15.380 --> 45:16.671
Yeah.

45:17.590 --> 45:19.508
Right as rain.

45:25.723 --> 45:28.225
Do you have your keys?

45:28.393 --> 45:29.810
Yeah.

45:31.145 --> 45:34.523
It's parked three blocks
down on the right.

45:36.943 --> 45:38.443
Yeah.
