02:48.603 --> 02:52.607
- As I was saying, it's about
a thousand square meters,

02:52.650 --> 02:54.913
really spacious.

02:54.957 --> 02:57.655
Your daughter will have
plenty of room to run around,

03:04.445 --> 03:06.142
I have a daughter, too.

03:06.186 --> 03:09.319
You'll see how lucky you are
to have such a big yard too.

03:09.363 --> 03:10.494
It was beautiful once.

03:10.538 --> 03:12.235
There were lots of flowers here,

03:12.279 --> 03:14.672
some lawn furniture also,

03:14.716 --> 03:17.588
but they took it all away
because the rain ruined it.

03:23.159 --> 03:24.029
- Who lived here?

03:26.162 --> 03:28.817
- The owner was an
old woman, Mrs. White.

03:28.860 --> 03:30.949
She passed away two years ago.

03:32.168 --> 03:34.301
The children moved
away for work.

03:34.344 --> 03:36.303
They decided to rent it,

03:36.346 --> 03:38.653
and they'll probably
sell it in a few years.

03:53.624 --> 03:55.757
The decorations
aren't that great,

03:55.800 --> 03:59.935
but it's a lot of
room for your budget.

04:04.331 --> 04:05.419
Let's go upstairs!

04:11.076 --> 04:13.731
[ominous music]

04:18.693 --> 04:19.998
The main bedroom is here.

04:26.483 --> 04:28.050
And there's a smaller bedroom.

04:28.093 --> 04:29.443
It's perfect for the kid.

04:30.705 --> 04:32.837
There is also an attic upstairs.

04:32.881 --> 04:37.277
You can use it as a storage
or as an office if you prefer.

04:41.846 --> 04:42.934
- Come on.

04:44.371 --> 04:45.894
It's only temporary.

04:48.636 --> 04:51.291
You'll like it when it's all
fixed up and clean, I bet.

05:45.736 --> 05:46.868
It's okay.

05:46.911 --> 05:47.999
It won't hurt you.

Come on, come with
me in the other room.

06:14.025 --> 06:15.070
I know what we'll do.

06:15.113 --> 06:17.115
Let's order a pizza.

06:17.159 --> 06:18.726
Now, what do you say?

06:18.769 --> 06:20.597
Do you like that idea?

08:27.463 --> 08:28.420
What is it?

08:53.141 --> 08:55.535
September 10, 1989.

09:04.892 --> 09:07.764
[ominous music]

09:17.600 --> 09:19.471

Hmm.

10:15.919 --> 10:18.052
What are you gonna tell
Dr. Loris tomorrow?

10:18.095 --> 10:18.966
That you're tired?

10:20.054 --> 10:20.837
Time for bed!

10:32.370 --> 10:33.154
Goodnight!

10:56.743 --> 10:59.659

11:19.374 --> 11:22.029

these toys, Sophie?

11:23.770 --> 11:24.814
Which is your favorite?

11:32.169 --> 11:33.257
Who are they?

11:42.571 --> 11:44.225
What are they doing?

11:45.356 --> 11:48.403
[melancholy music]

12:03.244 --> 12:04.288
And who is it?

12:32.186 --> 12:34.710
Her parents death shocked her.

12:34.754 --> 12:37.278
You have to stay close
to her, Annabelle

12:37.321 --> 12:39.889
Sophie's going through
a delicate phase.

12:39.933 --> 12:42.326
I know there isn't a lot
of trust between you.

12:42.370 --> 12:44.372
The fact that Sophie
doesn't speak anymore

12:44.415 --> 12:46.287
certainly doesn't help,

12:46.330 --> 12:48.942
but you have to try
and forge a connection.

12:50.465 --> 12:51.771
- I'm trying.

12:53.120 --> 12:56.514
It's just, it's like
there's a wall there.

12:56.558 --> 12:58.865
I hadn't seen my
sister in 10 years.

13:00.562 --> 13:03.391
The first time I even met
Sophie was in the court

13:03.434 --> 13:05.610
when they were giving
me the guardianship.

13:06.916 --> 13:09.484
- I know, it's normal,
she feels abandoned.

13:09.527 --> 13:10.615
Everything's new.

13:11.616 --> 13:13.140
You have to insist,

13:14.402 --> 13:16.012
even if she seems like

13:16.056 --> 13:18.580
she has no interest
in knowing you at all.

13:20.016 --> 13:22.323
She needs you,
you're all she has.

13:43.213 --> 13:46.303
[suspenseful music]

14:30.695 --> 14:32.393
- Hi!

14:32.436 --> 14:33.873
I'm Annabelle Spear.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.831
I called on Thursday about
restoring some books.

14:35.875 --> 14:36.788
They said to come by today.

14:36.832 --> 14:38.529
- Oh, yes, I was expecting you.

14:38.573 --> 14:39.922
I'm Eva.

14:39.966 --> 14:41.358
Mrs. Brown told me
you were coming.

14:52.500 --> 14:53.327
Let's go!

14:56.025 --> 14:57.722
There was a mouse, actually.

14:57.766 --> 15:00.029
More than one to
tell you the truth.

15:00.073 --> 15:02.118
The damn critters
chewed on some books.

15:02.162 --> 15:05.121
I hope that doesn't
gross you out.

15:05.165 --> 15:06.296
- Chewed pages, no.

15:06.340 --> 15:10.170
A mouse between the pages maybe.

15:10.213 --> 15:12.650
- Don't worry, I'm
fighting back with poison.

15:18.656 --> 15:21.268
There are five of them in all.

15:21.311 --> 15:22.138
- Perfect.

[ominous music]

15:42.985 --> 15:46.075
[suspenseful music]

15:51.124 --> 15:52.908
- You're bringing
that to school, too?

15:56.346 --> 15:57.217
You don't need it.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.184
Don't tear the flowers
up out of the garden.

16:08.228 --> 16:10.578
Why did you put them
on my bed this morning?

16:20.805 --> 16:21.850
So, who did?

22:58.899 --> 23:01.118
[ominous music]

23:01.162 --> 23:05.035
I don't know if it's me
doing something wrong.

23:05.079 --> 23:06.167
Maybe it's something I'm doing

23:06.210 --> 23:07.908
that's making her act like this.

23:07.951 --> 23:10.258
- Sophie's behavior is normal.

23:10.301 --> 23:11.564
Creating an imaginary friend

23:11.607 --> 23:14.349
is a way for her to
feel less lonely.

23:18.135 --> 23:19.789
- I don't know, Loris.

23:19.833 --> 23:21.225
For the last few days,

23:21.269 --> 23:22.836
I keep finding rose
petals on my pillow.

23:24.098 --> 23:26.056
Sophie says it wasn't her.

23:26.100 --> 23:28.668
She seems so convincing.

23:28.711 --> 23:31.845
I, I wouldn't want
her be creating

23:31.888 --> 23:34.413
some kind of split personality.

23:34.456 --> 23:36.066
That's what you call it, right?

23:36.110 --> 23:37.503
- No, I don't believe so.

23:37.546 --> 23:41.071
Listen, bring her by
my office tomorrow.

23:41.115 --> 23:43.378
It'll put your mind at ease.

23:43.422 --> 23:44.771
- Alright, thanks.

touch my carillon!

25:21.520 --> 25:23.783
- Sophie, what are you doing?

25:23.826 --> 25:25.262
Stop it!

25:25.306 --> 25:27.090
Sophie, Sophie!

Sophie, stop it!

25:29.528 --> 25:31.051
Sophie, stop it!

25:32.313 --> 25:34.533
Gosh, what are
you doing, Sophie?

25:34.576 --> 25:37.579
You don't ever hit
anyone, do you under ...

you doing out here?

29:01.435 --> 29:02.610
Sophie, go to bed.

29:31.030 --> 29:32.466
- I'm going to show you a color

29:32.509 --> 29:34.511
and you tell me what
it makes you think of,

29:34.555 --> 29:35.774
whatever comes to mind.

29:40.343 --> 29:42.128
That carillon is really nice

29:43.825 --> 29:45.131
Can I look at it closer?

30:05.847 --> 30:06.892
Who'll get angry?

30:25.084 --> 30:27.129
Your imaginary friend?

30:27.173 --> 30:32.352
[ominous music]
[lightbulb buzzing]

30:39.838 --> 30:42.666
Tell me about her,
what's her name?

30:55.897 --> 30:57.638
What is it, Sophie?

30:57.681 --> 30:58.900
Is Lania here with us?

31:00.162 --> 31:05.167
[ominous music]
[lightbulb buzzing]

31:18.050 --> 31:19.355
Is there some pet you have

31:19.399 --> 31:21.705
or maybe a friend
of hers named Lania?

31:23.925 --> 31:26.101
- Not that I know of.

31:26.145 --> 31:27.755
Who's Lania?

31:27.798 --> 31:31.585
- Sophie associates this name
with her imaginary friend.

31:31.628 --> 31:33.326
She's really convinced.

31:34.457 --> 31:38.200
She really fantasizes
seeing her.

31:38.244 --> 31:39.593
- She talks to her.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.291
The other night, she
was out in the garden.

31:42.335 --> 31:44.424
I swear I heard her talking.

31:44.467 --> 31:45.686
- That's great news.

31:46.861 --> 31:48.645
She's starting to speak again.

31:48.689 --> 31:50.125
That's always a good start.

31:51.257 --> 31:53.868
She went through
a horrible shock.

31:53.912 --> 31:58.046
Her not speaking, creating
an imaginary friends,

31:58.090 --> 32:00.266
it's just a phase,
she'll get over it.

32:00.309 --> 32:02.224
- It's really nice of
you to reassure me.

32:02.268 --> 32:05.880
It's really tough, the house,

32:05.924 --> 32:07.490
and work,

32:07.534 --> 32:09.710
and Sophie is so

32:12.017 --> 32:13.018
unusual.

32:14.019 --> 32:16.586
Thank you.
- Of course.

32:16.630 --> 32:18.762
Before, she almost
had me convinced.

32:20.329 --> 32:21.461
If you think it might help,

32:21.504 --> 32:23.811
I could come to the
house for her sessions.

32:25.769 --> 32:28.207
Maybe it would make her
feel more comfortable.

32:29.599 --> 32:30.426
- Thanks!

it makes you think of.

Sophie?

35:29.910 --> 35:32.391
[eerie music]

35:40.225 --> 35:43.184
[knocking on door]

36:10.037 --> 36:12.996
[knocking on door]

36:16.478 --> 36:17.262
- Hey.

36:19.394 --> 36:21.962
- Hey, I need to talk to you.

36:23.529 --> 36:24.617
Are you okay?

36:26.880 --> 36:27.707
- Yeah.

36:40.502 --> 36:41.808
- How did you fall?

36:44.071 --> 36:45.725
- Uh, I don't remember.

36:45.768 --> 36:48.206
I just fell back and ...

36:50.512 --> 36:52.427
- I don't know you that well,

36:52.471 --> 36:55.213
but I know now that
you're a terrible liar.

36:59.217 --> 37:02.307
[suspenseful music]

37:15.145 --> 37:16.886
- I saw something
that scared me.

37:20.107 --> 37:20.934
- Lania?

37:28.507 --> 37:30.204
Hold the ice there.

37:40.345 --> 37:42.912
- Loris, I think it's time
I call social services

37:42.956 --> 37:44.436
and reconsider the guardianship.

37:46.089 --> 37:48.440
I'm afraid I have real problems.

37:50.137 --> 37:50.964
I'm not well

37:52.313 --> 37:56.926
and I'm afraid that if
things keep up like this,

37:56.970 --> 37:58.188
I'm gonna need therapy.

38:00.713 --> 38:04.194
It's just,

38:04.238 --> 38:06.980
it's the fantasy of a child,

38:07.023 --> 38:10.810
and me, she's rubbing off on me,

38:10.853 --> 38:12.725
and I am going crazy.

38:14.727 --> 38:15.510
- No, Annabelle.

38:17.512 --> 38:18.861
I'm here because
I wanna show you

38:18.905 --> 38:21.124
the video of this
morning's sessions.

38:28.828 --> 38:29.959
Your imaginary friend?

38:39.969 --> 38:42.058
[gasps]

38:46.367 --> 38:47.499
- Oh, my God!

38:49.805 --> 38:51.590
- [Loris] Sophie
and I were alone.

38:54.288 --> 38:55.420
- What does she want with us?

38:55.463 --> 38:57.030
Why is she following Sophie?

38:58.597 --> 38:59.902
- [Loris] I don't
know, Annabelle.

38:59.946 --> 39:03.297
Whatever it is, she's
connected to your niece.

39:07.562 --> 39:09.259
- It was her in the attic.

39:11.392 --> 39:13.916
- This makes me doubt
everything I thought was true.

39:16.397 --> 39:18.704
If I hadn't seen the video,

39:18.747 --> 39:20.270
I would have never believed you.

39:22.229 --> 39:23.186
- It's the carillon!

39:24.231 --> 39:26.102
It all started
when she found it.

39:29.845 --> 39:32.326
It was buried in this
box in the garden.

39:38.898 --> 39:40.813
Can you come with
me to the library?

39:45.383 --> 39:47.907
In this book, there's a symbol

39:47.950 --> 39:50.039
identical to the one on the box.

39:54.609 --> 39:56.394
I wanna know who
checked the book out.

39:59.701 --> 40:01.877
- [Loris] What does it mean?

40:01.921 --> 40:03.183
Do you think
whoever had the book

40:03.226 --> 40:05.794
was the one to inscribe
that symbol on the box

40:05.838 --> 40:06.665
and bury it?

40:09.319 --> 40:11.147
- I don't know it could be.

40:11.191 --> 40:13.323
It's the only thing
that makes any sense.

40:15.543 --> 40:17.937
Maybe, Eva the
librarian, can help us.

40:19.460 --> 40:21.854
- What year do the
lending files go back to?

40:23.725 --> 40:25.727
- The library was
opened in 1962.

40:28.034 --> 40:31.124
[suspenseful music]

40:35.171 --> 40:37.304
- Eva, out of curiosity,

40:37.347 --> 40:40.002
could you let me know who
checked this book out last?

40:40.046 --> 40:42.091
- Oh, Annabelle, I can't.

40:42.135 --> 40:43.963
Privacy, you know?

40:44.006 --> 40:45.878
I'm, I'm sorry.

40:51.797 --> 40:54.234
Why do you want to know?

40:54.277 --> 40:56.279
- Just work reasons.

40:58.586 --> 41:00.109
- You didn't get it from me.

41:06.507 --> 41:10.859
The last time the book
was taken out was in 1989,

41:12.818 --> 41:17.736
Margaret White, 34
Saint Louis Street.

41:22.131 --> 41:24.220
- Okay, okay, thanks.

41:30.836 --> 41:32.881
Sophie, come on, let's go.

41:39.584 --> 41:40.976
- Isn't that your house?

41:44.458 --> 41:48.157
So, the former tenant
buried it probably.

41:48.201 --> 41:50.551
Do you know where they live now?

41:50.595 --> 41:52.335
- She died two years ago.

41:58.472 --> 42:00.605
I have got to know
what that symbol means.

42:05.914 --> 42:08.743
- Annabelle, could
you come here, please?

42:12.442 --> 42:16.838
That book deals
with supernatural
if I'm not mistaken.

42:16.882 --> 42:18.492
- Yeah.

42:18.536 --> 42:21.060
- I overheard your conversation.

42:21.103 --> 42:22.714
There is a woman.

42:22.757 --> 42:24.629
She comes very
often at the library

42:24.672 --> 42:27.806
and she takes out
book like that.

42:27.849 --> 42:30.025
She's a psychic or so she says,

42:30.069 --> 42:32.854
but in any case,

42:32.898 --> 42:35.204
she knows a lot
about supernatural.

42:36.379 --> 42:37.598
She's really nice, too.

42:39.078 --> 42:40.340
Maybe she could help you.

42:41.210 --> 42:41.950
- Yeah.

42:46.781 --> 42:49.044
Eva can I just ask
you one more favor?

42:49.088 --> 42:50.524
- Sure.

42:50.568 --> 42:51.830
- When I go to
talk to this woman,

42:51.873 --> 42:52.961
can I leave Sophie
here with you?

42:53.005 --> 42:54.484
- Oh, yeah.

42:58.184 --> 43:00.882
This is her address.

43:00.926 --> 43:01.927
- Thank you.

43:03.624 --> 43:06.584
[doorbell buzzing]

43:14.983 --> 43:16.419
- Hi!

43:16.463 --> 43:17.812
- Hi, I'm Annabelle Spear,

43:17.856 --> 43:19.597
and we're looking
for Mrs. Nills.

43:19.640 --> 43:20.989
- [Morris] It's late.

43:21.033 --> 43:23.035
She's not seeing
anyone else today.

43:23.078 --> 43:24.602
- I'm sorry for bothering you.

43:24.645 --> 43:26.952
Eva the librarian, said
that she could help me.

43:26.995 --> 43:30.216
I'm trying to find the
meaning of a symbol.

43:30.259 --> 43:31.652
Please, I'm desperate.

43:33.045 --> 43:34.786
- One can plead with
the saints for mercy,

43:34.829 --> 43:37.527
but Morris, my
assistant, is no saint,

43:37.571 --> 43:39.094
or am I missing something?

43:39.138 --> 43:42.315
- [Morris] These people
were hoping to see you.

43:42.358 --> 43:45.492
- I need to speak with you
just for a few minutes.

43:45.535 --> 43:47.581
- Here at the door or inside?

44:16.305 --> 44:18.090
It's written in Latin.

44:19.613 --> 44:21.876
If you're here to ask my help,

44:21.920 --> 44:24.096
I imagine you believe
in the supernatural.

44:25.880 --> 44:28.753
- Mrs. Nills, I saw the
symbol printed on this book

44:28.796 --> 44:30.929
carved on a box
that my niece found.

44:32.278 --> 44:33.714
- May I ask where you found it?

44:35.107 --> 44:37.239
- It was buried in the garden.

44:40.590 --> 44:41.940
- If I were you,

44:41.983 --> 44:43.855
I would put it right
back where it was buried.

44:43.898 --> 44:45.595
It's a warning.

44:45.639 --> 44:48.033
This symbol means
it's possessed.

44:48.076 --> 44:49.121
I'll explain better.

44:50.775 --> 44:54.517
Sometimes, tormented souls
attach themselves to an object

44:54.561 --> 44:56.955
and are unable to let it go.

44:56.998 --> 44:59.435
Sort of like there
are haunted places,

44:59.479 --> 45:01.350
there are also haunted objects.

45:03.483 --> 45:05.180
The more time spent
with an object,

45:05.224 --> 45:06.573
the more its owner
connects with it,

45:06.616 --> 45:09.707
until they finally,
can't be without it.

45:11.012 --> 45:12.840
The tormented soul
can also affect

45:12.884 --> 45:14.668
the personality of the owner,

45:14.712 --> 45:17.062
making them absorb their
positive or negative energy,

45:17.105 --> 45:19.107
whatever the case may be.

45:19.151 --> 45:23.242
- Well, positive or
negative in what sense?

45:24.591 --> 45:27.202
- A possessed object
can be good luck

45:29.117 --> 45:31.772
if the spirit connected to
it experienced immense joy,

45:33.382 --> 45:35.123
while it can cause misery

45:35.167 --> 45:38.039
if the object was connected
with a tragic or sad event.

45:40.520 --> 45:43.653
- So, if I understand
you correctly,

45:45.786 --> 45:47.396
the spirit makes a
strong connection

45:47.440 --> 45:50.269
with whoever comes to
possess the haunted object.

45:50.312 --> 45:51.096
Right?

45:52.488 --> 45:55.317
- No, it's much worse.

45:55.361 --> 45:56.623
It conditions their life.

46:00.322 --> 46:01.541
Did you open the box?

46:04.849 --> 46:05.545
- Yes.

46:05.588 --> 46:06.459
- And, what was in it?

46:08.243 --> 46:11.464
[music box tinkling]

46:32.485 --> 46:34.879
- Sophie, be careful!

46:36.445 --> 46:38.839
Don't wander around
the bookshelves.

46:40.406 --> 46:45.585
[ominous music]
[raspy breathing]

46:58.380 --> 46:59.207
Sophie?

47:00.513 --> 47:01.340
Sophie?

47:40.988 --> 47:42.468
[giggling]

47:42.511 --> 47:45.775
[music box tinkling]

48:23.683 --> 48:26.599
[raspy breathing]

49:05.464 --> 49:08.119
[ominous music]

49:42.327 --> 49:43.241
- I'm sorry I'm late.

49:43.284 --> 49:46.200
- That's okay, she's sleeping.

49:46.244 --> 49:48.289
- I hope it wasn't too
much trouble for you

49:48.333 --> 49:49.899
- No, not at all.

49:50.813 --> 49:53.251
Did you find Mrs. Nills?
- Yes.

49:54.469 --> 49:56.384
[phone ringing]

49:56.428 --> 49:57.211
- Oh, sorry.

50:01.911 --> 50:02.738
Hello?

50:15.360 --> 50:18.015
[ominous music]

50:19.668 --> 50:22.932
[melancholy music]

50:30.679 --> 50:33.856
- Thank you so much
for everything,

50:33.900 --> 50:37.643
for being here with Sophie
and I, I really appreciate it.

50:44.563 --> 50:47.392
[romantic music]

50:59.273 --> 51:00.057
- I'm sorry.

51:01.319 --> 51:02.146
- It's not you.

51:04.670 --> 51:07.107
- I'll call you tomorrow
to check on Sophie.

51:10.589 --> 51:14.158
[door opening and closing]

51:37.485 --> 51:42.664
[ominous music]
[raspy humming]

51:45.928 --> 51:46.973
- Is somebody there?

51:52.587 --> 51:53.980
Dumb mice.

52:15.610 --> 52:18.352
[ominous music]

52:44.857 --> 52:47.642
[birds chirping]

52:52.125 --> 52:54.997
[thumping]
- No!

52:57.130 --> 53:02.309
[thumping]
[Sophie grunting]

53:02.353 --> 53:03.092
- Sophie.

53:05.573 --> 53:06.922
Sophie, calm down!

53:10.056 --> 53:12.363
Don't ever do that
again, do you understand?

53:12.406 --> 53:13.886
- You're not my mother!

53:13.929 --> 53:16.976
[dramatic music]

53:20.371 --> 53:21.198
- Sophie!

53:22.721 --> 53:25.506
[door closing]

53:46.397 --> 53:48.181
Hi, have you seen a little girl?

53:48.225 --> 53:49.487
- She's over there.

53:49.530 --> 53:50.575
- Okay.

53:50.618 --> 53:53.230
[sighs] Okay.

53:53.273 --> 53:54.535
Is Eva off today?

53:54.579 --> 53:55.754
- She's in the hospital.

53:55.797 --> 53:57.103
We found her unconscious.

53:59.584 --> 54:00.933
- Oh my God, that's awful.

54:02.108 --> 54:05.198
[suspenseful music]

54:11.509 --> 54:12.901
Everything all right at school?

54:24.043 --> 54:25.958
Sophie, can I see your carillon?

54:26.001 --> 54:27.089
- No.

54:31.180 --> 54:32.443
- What if I just
take it for tonight,

54:32.486 --> 54:34.314
and I give it back tomorrow?

54:34.358 --> 54:35.184
- No.

54:38.579 --> 54:40.407
- Sophie, give me the carillon.

54:40.451 --> 54:41.626
[glass shattering]

54:41.669 --> 54:46.848
Sophie!
[ominous music]

54:56.597 --> 54:59.339
[Sophie sobbing]

55:07.782 --> 55:10.045
Sophie, don't worry, sweetie.

55:12.613 --> 55:13.310
It's okay.

55:17.052 --> 55:18.271
- Lania is mean.

55:20.404 --> 55:22.406
- She can't be mean if
we bury the carillon.

55:28.325 --> 55:31.110
- Don't go away, you too.

55:31.153 --> 55:32.764
- What are you talking about?

55:32.807 --> 55:34.809
I'll never go away,

55:34.853 --> 55:37.899
but honey, we have
to bury the carillon.

55:39.118 --> 55:40.424
- Okay, tomorrow?

55:44.253 --> 55:45.167
- Tomorrow.

55:55.787 --> 55:58.877
[suspenseful music]

56:32.476 --> 56:34.347
[music box tinkles softly]

[wolf howling]

57:07.032 --> 57:09.121
[sighs]

57:49.248 --> 57:51.293
- Did you bury it?

57:51.337 --> 57:53.948
- Yes, sweetheart
the carillon is gone.

58:24.979 --> 58:27.634
[ominous music]

58:56.228 --> 59:01.407
[glass shattering]
[Sophie shrieks]

59:24.473 --> 59:29.827
[dramatic music]
[Sophie shrieks]

59:51.718 --> 59:54.329
I buried the box
but it didn't work,

59:54.373 --> 59:55.592
Then all this happened.

59:56.810 --> 59:59.900
[suspenseful music]

1:00:15.524 --> 1:00:17.788
- So, you say it's the
spirit of a little girl?

1:00:17.831 --> 1:00:19.920
- Yes, Lania, that's her name.

1:00:21.618 --> 1:00:24.011
At least that's what
Sophie calls her.

1:00:24.055 --> 1:00:27.232
- And, your niece sees her
all the time and talks to her?

1:00:27.275 --> 1:00:31.453
- Yes, she dug up
the box by herself,

1:00:31.497 --> 1:00:32.498
maybe that's why.

1:00:34.152 --> 1:00:35.153
- May I see the box?

1:00:47.208 --> 1:00:49.123
Do you know who lived
here before you?

1:00:50.734 --> 1:00:54.302
- Yes, of course Mrs. White,
but I didn't know her.

1:00:55.913 --> 1:00:57.915
- So, you don't know what
she did in this house?

1:01:02.528 --> 1:01:03.834
- She was a psychic herself.

1:01:05.096 --> 1:01:06.184
- In those days,

1:01:08.055 --> 1:01:09.666
I mean when I was just a girl,

1:01:11.015 --> 1:01:13.191
people believed much
more in these things.

1:01:14.496 --> 1:01:17.195
They would come from
town to ask for her help.

1:01:17.238 --> 1:01:18.718
She had this kind of gift.

1:01:20.415 --> 1:01:22.287
She could speak to spirits.

1:01:26.204 --> 1:01:27.684
This is the symbol.

1:01:29.511 --> 1:01:30.948
The carillon is inside,

1:01:30.991 --> 1:01:32.297
correct?
- Yes.

1:01:38.172 --> 1:01:39.434
- It was locked inside here.

1:01:41.306 --> 1:01:43.134
This is certainly
not a good spirit.

1:01:44.831 --> 1:01:48.008
[footsteps pounding]

1:01:53.797 --> 1:01:56.887
[suspenseful music]

1:02:22.826 --> 1:02:23.652
Morris?

1:02:43.803 --> 1:02:44.848
- May I?

1:02:46.066 --> 1:02:46.850
- Yes.

1:03:04.693 --> 1:03:07.348
- Mrs. White knew the
world of the afterlife

1:03:07.392 --> 1:03:08.697
very intimately.

1:03:10.482 --> 1:03:13.050
She knew how to defend
herself from evil.

1:03:14.878 --> 1:03:16.401
This is a protective symbol.

1:03:18.838 --> 1:03:22.537
The spirit of this child has
been, let's say, weakened,

1:03:24.148 --> 1:03:26.585
because this house is protected.

1:03:26.628 --> 1:03:29.240
This is the safest
room in the house.

1:03:29.283 --> 1:03:30.807
Mrs. White probably worked here,

1:03:32.678 --> 1:03:35.986
however this protection
won't last forever.

1:03:36.029 --> 1:03:38.075
Generally, in cases
such as these,

1:03:38.118 --> 1:03:39.424
the more time passes,

1:03:40.817 --> 1:03:42.601
the more the person
that has the object

1:03:42.644 --> 1:03:45.734
becomes attached to
that possessed object.

1:03:45.778 --> 1:03:47.475
Simply put,

1:03:47.519 --> 1:03:50.652
the more time your niece
spends with the carillon,

1:03:50.696 --> 1:03:52.698
the more powerful
the spirit becomes,

1:03:52.741 --> 1:03:55.048
regardless of where it is,

1:03:55.092 --> 1:03:57.703
because, in a certain
sense, they become one.

1:04:00.488 --> 1:04:03.317
- We, we did didn't do anything
when we buried it again.

1:04:05.537 --> 1:04:07.321
What do we do?

1:04:07.365 --> 1:04:08.714
- I'm sorry, I don't know.

1:04:14.981 --> 1:04:17.505
Let's ask Mrs. White for help.

1:04:17.549 --> 1:04:18.376
Morris?

1:04:36.481 --> 1:04:39.484
[ominous grumbling]

1:04:42.487 --> 1:04:46.099
Mrs. White, you
lived in this house.

1:04:48.406 --> 1:04:49.842
I need to speak with you.

1:04:52.279 --> 1:04:56.153
If your spirit is with
us, please give me a sign.

1:05:04.378 --> 1:05:08.905
Mrs. White, if your
spirit is with us,

1:05:08.948 --> 1:05:10.515
please, give me a sign.

1:05:27.706 --> 1:05:30.665
Hopefully, we can try
again another day.

1:05:30.709 --> 1:05:32.841
- Alright, thanks.

1:05:34.234 --> 1:05:37.629
- Put everything back
exactly as it was.

1:05:37.672 --> 1:05:39.109
It's a child spirit.

1:05:39.152 --> 1:05:41.328
It must know that
you are in control.

1:05:42.982 --> 1:05:45.942
[melancholy music]

1:07:07.458 --> 1:07:10.069
[ominous music]

1:07:35.486 --> 1:07:36.400
Third step.

1:08:19.834 --> 1:08:24.100
September 10,
1989, The Carillon.

1:08:26.145 --> 1:08:28.191
Mrs. Roseline Potter
asked for my help.

1:08:28.234 --> 1:08:31.368
A case of a possessed object,

1:08:31.411 --> 1:08:34.197
a carillon linked to the
spirit of a child named Lania.

1:08:35.807 --> 1:08:37.722
I shut the carillon in
a box and buried it,

1:08:37.765 --> 1:08:40.028
so that the spirit
connected to the object

1:08:40.072 --> 1:08:41.682
may rest in peace.

1:08:57.568 --> 1:09:00.179
[phone buzzing]

1:09:02.094 --> 1:09:02.921
Hello?

1:09:12.235 --> 1:09:14.541
- She felt really sick
during the session.

1:09:14.585 --> 1:09:17.849
I figured it was better not to
wait, so I brought her here.

1:09:17.892 --> 1:09:19.155
- How is she now?

1:09:19.198 --> 1:09:20.982
- The doctor is
inside with her now.

1:09:22.158 --> 1:09:25.248
[equipment beeping]

1:09:37.260 --> 1:09:39.653
- How is she?
- Are you her parents?

1:09:40.872 --> 1:09:43.091
- No, I'm her aunt.

1:09:43.135 --> 1:09:45.050
- [Doctor] She has got
a really high fever.

1:09:45.093 --> 1:09:46.443
We're doing more tests

1:09:46.486 --> 1:09:48.706
to try and understand
what the matter is.

1:09:48.749 --> 1:09:51.404
Medication doesn't seem to
have had an effect so far.

1:09:56.714 --> 1:09:59.673
[melancholy music]

1:10:12.512 --> 1:10:14.819
- The carillon.
- No, sweetie.

1:10:14.862 --> 1:10:15.646
- The carillon.

1:10:20.041 --> 1:10:22.130
I want to hear it, please.

1:10:27.832 --> 1:10:30.530
[ominous music]

1:10:41.715 --> 1:10:44.327
[door opening]

1:10:46.503 --> 1:10:50.028
- The doctor says that her
condition is back to normal.

1:10:50.071 --> 1:10:51.769
Tests show everything is fine.

1:10:53.466 --> 1:10:55.207
They'll keep an
eye on her tonight

1:10:55.251 --> 1:10:56.861
and release her
tomorrow morning.

1:10:59.777 --> 1:11:00.604
- Thanks.

1:11:03.824 --> 1:11:06.174
[Annabelle sobbing]

1:11:06.218 --> 1:11:08.176
- Hey, come on.

1:11:08.220 --> 1:11:10.222
The doctor says she's fine.

1:11:10.266 --> 1:11:11.092
Don't worry.

1:11:13.878 --> 1:11:16.315
I saw that Sophie is
starting to speak again.

1:11:16.359 --> 1:11:18.317
- Yeah, and the first
thing she said to me

1:11:18.361 --> 1:11:20.058
is that I'm not her mother.

1:11:22.495 --> 1:11:24.192
Since Sophie has
come into my life,

1:11:24.236 --> 1:11:26.804
everything has
gotten so difficult.

1:11:26.847 --> 1:11:29.676
- Don't say that,
everything will work out.

1:11:37.989 --> 1:11:39.338
See you tomorrow.

1:11:43.647 --> 1:11:45.692
If you need anything ...

1:11:50.828 --> 1:11:53.787
[melancholy music]

1:12:02.796 --> 1:12:05.973
[music box tinkling]

1:12:13.198 --> 1:12:13.981
- What do you want to eat?

1:12:14.025 --> 1:12:15.026
Should we order a pizza?

1:12:33.653 --> 1:12:36.569
[ominous music]

1:13:31.102 --> 1:13:33.060
- [Loris] Okay, yeah.

1:13:33.104 --> 1:13:35.062
- I just need you
for another hour.

1:13:35.106 --> 1:13:36.150
In the diary of Mrs. White,

1:13:36.194 --> 1:13:37.413
I found the person who asked her

1:13:37.456 --> 1:13:39.240
for help with the carillon.

1:13:39.284 --> 1:13:41.199
I wanna go talk to her.

1:13:41.242 --> 1:13:43.070
- Sure, don't worry.

1:13:43.114 --> 1:13:44.637
- Okay, thank you.

1:13:48.380 --> 1:13:51.557
[music box tinkling]

1:14:04.657 --> 1:14:06.529
Are you Mrs. Roseline Potter?

1:14:06.572 --> 1:14:08.748
- Yes, who wants to know?

1:14:08.792 --> 1:14:11.142
- Hello, I'm sorry,
you don't know me.

1:14:11.185 --> 1:14:13.449
My name is Annabelle Spear.

1:14:13.492 --> 1:14:14.972
I need your help.

1:14:15.015 --> 1:14:16.843
- What's this about?

1:14:16.887 --> 1:14:19.759
- I know that, years
ago, you had a carillon.

1:14:19.803 --> 1:14:21.021
- Go away!

1:14:21.065 --> 1:14:23.023
- No, no Mrs. Potter,
please, please!

1:14:23.067 --> 1:14:24.503
I need to talk to you.

1:14:24.547 --> 1:14:26.505
I know about your daughter Jade.

1:14:26.549 --> 1:14:29.769
Please, it's about my
niece, she's only six.

1:14:29.813 --> 1:14:30.640
Please.

1:14:33.686 --> 1:14:34.731
- Come on.

1:14:40.084 --> 1:14:41.520
- I didn't think to
contact a psychic

1:14:43.261 --> 1:14:45.698
until after the death
of my daughter, Jade.

1:14:47.091 --> 1:14:48.179
Mrs. White.

1:14:50.747 --> 1:14:54.707
Lania, after Jade was gone,

1:14:55.839 --> 1:14:57.536
manifested herself to me.

1:14:59.233 --> 1:15:00.887
She didn't try to hurt me.

1:15:00.931 --> 1:15:03.455
She was just there, next to me.

1:15:03.499 --> 1:15:05.631
She was there always,

1:15:07.415 --> 1:15:09.635
until Mrs. White found
a way to free me.

1:15:11.768 --> 1:15:14.727
She put the carillon in
a box and she buried it.

1:15:17.513 --> 1:15:19.558
[ominous music]

1:15:19.602 --> 1:15:21.691
- My niece found it
playing in the garden

1:15:24.345 --> 1:15:25.782
and since then, it's,

1:15:27.174 --> 1:15:28.567
it's been a nightmare.

1:15:30.090 --> 1:15:32.179
Do you know exactly
what Mrs. White did?

1:15:32.223 --> 1:15:34.704
I tried burying the box again.

1:15:34.747 --> 1:15:36.923
It didn't make any difference.

1:15:36.967 --> 1:15:39.012
- [Mrs. Potter] I'm
sorry, I don't know.

1:15:46.933 --> 1:15:50.458
- Where did she
get the carillon?

1:15:50.502 --> 1:15:52.722
- She got it at
an antiques fair.

1:15:54.419 --> 1:15:56.856
My daughter couldn't
be separated from it.

1:15:56.900 --> 1:15:59.119
She listened to it all the time.

1:16:01.687 --> 1:16:03.036
In the beginning,

1:16:03.080 --> 1:16:05.343
she said she was playing
with a little girl.

1:16:05.386 --> 1:16:07.606
I didn't believe her.

1:16:07.650 --> 1:16:09.652
I just thought she
wanted more attention.

1:16:12.219 --> 1:16:13.743
Then she started to get sick.

1:16:15.440 --> 1:16:17.964
She had this high
incurable fever.

1:16:18.008 --> 1:16:19.444
It would come and go.

1:16:19.487 --> 1:16:21.620
She'd seem to get better
and then she'd get worse.

1:16:25.276 --> 1:16:26.582
I'll never forget that night.

1:16:29.585 --> 1:16:33.110
I was, I was sitting
there reading

1:16:33.153 --> 1:16:37.723
and when I heard the carillon
play its entire melody,

1:16:37.767 --> 1:16:39.290
I had never heard the
whole thing through.

1:16:39.333 --> 1:16:40.770
It would always get stuck.

1:16:43.903 --> 1:16:45.949
I just felt something was wrong.

1:16:45.992 --> 1:16:49.213
I went to try and find Jade.

1:16:52.085 --> 1:16:53.478
I found her there on the sofa.

1:16:55.349 --> 1:16:57.047
She was dead.

1:16:57.090 --> 1:16:58.483
She'd been smothered.

1:17:01.181 --> 1:17:03.575
The carillon was
there next to her.

1:17:06.970 --> 1:17:09.059
If only I'd believed her.

1:17:13.411 --> 1:17:17.589
Do you wake up with rose
petals on your bed everyday?

1:17:17.633 --> 1:17:19.765
Lania did the same
thing with me.

1:17:19.809 --> 1:17:21.680
She gave me rose
petals every morning.

1:17:21.724 --> 1:17:23.290
She put them on my pillow.

1:17:25.162 --> 1:17:28.948
I think it was some sort
of attention, a gift.

1:17:31.951 --> 1:17:34.388
She wanted me as her mother.

1:17:35.999 --> 1:17:38.044
That's why she
killed my daughter.

1:17:40.394 --> 1:17:42.440
And now, she wants to
get rid of your niece.

1:17:47.837 --> 1:17:48.664
- She wants me.

1:17:53.103 --> 1:17:55.540
The carillon has almost
played its whole tune.

1:17:56.976 --> 1:17:58.108
- Then the time has come.

1:17:59.413 --> 1:18:00.197
[dramatic music]
- Sophie!

1:18:05.593 --> 1:18:08.771
[music box tinkling]

1:18:11.687 --> 1:18:13.036
- What's wrong, Sophie?

1:18:14.864 --> 1:18:16.822
- Aunt Annabelle doesn't care.

1:18:25.788 --> 1:18:28.704
- Come on, you know
that's not true.

1:18:28.747 --> 1:18:30.749
Don't ever think that.

1:18:30.793 --> 1:18:33.621
[banging]

1:18:33.665 --> 1:18:38.844
[ominous rumbling]
[window shutters banging]

1:18:44.545 --> 1:18:48.158

[Sophie shrieks]

[dramatic music]
[door slams]

1:18:53.903 --> 1:18:56.514
[Sophie shrieks]

[Annabelle sobbing]

[electricity buzzing]
[suspenseful music]

1:19:24.498 --> 1:19:25.804
Is anybody there?

1:19:38.599 --> 1:19:40.427
- [Lania] I'm here.

1:19:41.559 --> 1:19:43.474
[giggling]

1:19:43.517 --> 1:19:48.696

1:19:51.961 --> 1:19:54.790
[Lania giggling]

1:19:59.142 --> 1:19:59.925
I'm here!

1:20:05.148 --> 1:20:05.975
Ha!

1:20:28.432 --> 1:20:31.522
[crickets chirping]

1:20:39.660 --> 1:20:43.142
[ominous music]

1:20:43.186 --> 1:20:46.406
[music box tinkling]

1:20:46.450 --> 1:20:49.496
[Sophie sobbing]

1:20:55.938 --> 1:20:56.764
- Sophie!

1:20:58.766 --> 1:21:01.160
- You didn't go away.

1:21:01.204 --> 1:21:04.033
- I will never go away, okay?

1:21:04.076 --> 1:21:06.209
I will never go away, okay?

1:21:07.253 --> 1:21:08.515
Now, let's go!

1:21:13.303 --> 1:21:18.482
[suspenseful music]
[music box tinkling]

1:21:48.816 --> 1:21:52.472
- [Mrs. Potter] I heard the
carillon play its entire melody.

1:21:52.516 --> 1:21:53.952
I had never heard the
whole thing through.

1:21:53.996 --> 1:21:55.823
It would always get stuck.

1:21:55.867 --> 1:21:57.216
- It didn't work

1:21:57.260 --> 1:22:01.133
because it didn't play
the whole melody yet.

1:22:01.177 --> 1:22:04.615
Sophie, you have
to listen to me,

1:22:04.658 --> 1:22:07.574
I have to bury the
carillon now, okay?
