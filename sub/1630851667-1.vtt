WEBVTT

00:51.218 --> 00:54.388
I've Got A Secret, presented by Winston.

00:54.471 --> 00:57.432
America's best-selling,
best-tasting filtered cigarette.

00:58.141 --> 01:00.769
Winston tastes good
like a cigarette should.

01:00.853 --> 01:04.230
Winston tastes good
Like a… cigarette should

01:04.313 --> 01:05.607
Yes, Winston filtered cigarettes

01:05.691 --> 01:09.778
bring you America's number one
panel show, I've Got A Secret.

01:12.990 --> 01:16.076
Now, panel, for reasons
which will become obvious,

01:16.159 --> 01:19.037
this gentleman on my left
will be known as Mr. X.

01:19.121 --> 01:22.332
I will tell you this, however,
that he is from Wales.

01:22.416 --> 01:25.502
He is a Welshman,
and, also, he is a musician.

01:29.256 --> 01:31.341
We'll be back in just 20 seconds.

01:32.009 --> 01:34.803
How much heroin
do you buy then each day?

01:35.971 --> 01:37.556
Twenty-nine grams.
Four or five dollars--

01:42.352 --> 01:45.230
Levittown, USA.
The carefully planned commu--

01:50.944 --> 01:55.365
From Dallas, Texas, the flash
apparently official, President Kennedy--

02:10.923 --> 02:12.841
One, two, three.

02:57.803 --> 03:00.222
This is John Cale, a composer-musician

03:00.305 --> 03:02.975
who last week performed in a concert
to end all concerts.

03:03.058 --> 03:05.894
What was really unusual
about this particular concert?

03:05.978 --> 03:08.063
Well, the performance took 18 hours.

03:09.106 --> 03:11.733
Can any of you guess
what Mr. Schenzer's secret then is?

03:12.693 --> 03:16.488
He was the only one who lasted
in the audience for the full 18 hours.

03:16.572 --> 03:18.365
Why is he doing this?

03:20.242 --> 03:23.203
How come it took
18 hours and 40 minutes to play this?

03:23.996 --> 03:26.623
Well, there's an instruction
by the composer Erik Satie here,

03:26.707 --> 03:30.210
which says that this piece of music here

03:30.294 --> 03:33.130
must be repeated 840 times.

03:33.755 --> 03:37.176
What would move a man
to say you must play it 840 times to--

03:37.259 --> 03:39.469
-for it to be complete?
-I have no idea.

04:15.047 --> 04:20.135
Wind
Wind blow

04:20.219 --> 04:25.057
Wind
Wind blow

04:25.140 --> 04:29.144
Wind
Wind blow

04:29.228 --> 04:31.563
Wind
Wind blow

04:31.647 --> 04:34.775
"I feel as if I were
in a motion picture theater.

04:35.943 --> 04:40.447
The long arm of light
crossing the darkness and spinning.

04:40.531 --> 04:42.658
My eyes fixed on the screen.

04:43.909 --> 04:47.037
The shots themselves
are full of dots and rays.

04:48.038 --> 04:51.208
I am anonymous and have forgotten myself.

04:52.918 --> 04:55.963
It is always so
when one goes to the movies.

04:57.256 --> 05:00.801
It is, as they say, a drug."

05:02.135 --> 05:07.558
In a dream that the wind brings to me

05:09.226 --> 05:11.103
We moved out
to Long Island when I was four.

05:11.186 --> 05:12.646
Lou would've been nine.

05:13.897 --> 05:16.483
We lived in a suburb, Freeport.

05:16.567 --> 05:20.988
Coming from Brooklyn
to this isolated suburban community,

05:21.071 --> 05:23.240
that was a hard, hard transition for him.

05:23.323 --> 05:25.158
In my arms

05:25.242 --> 05:27.786
Wind, wind

05:27.870 --> 05:29.162
My mom was a homemaker.

05:29.246 --> 05:32.416
My father wanted to be a novelist,
an author.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.711
My grandmother said,
"No, you're gonna be an accountant."

05:36.753 --> 05:38.255
So he became an accountant.

05:40.591 --> 05:43.302
If you were looking
for central casting

05:43.385 --> 05:47.264
to cast a 1950s family
where father knows best,

05:47.347 --> 05:50.726
I don't think he had much to do
with his father. His father worked.

05:50.809 --> 05:53.896
He was not the kinda guy
that you'd go out and toss a ball with.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.649
I don't know
what my father's aspirations for Lou were.

05:57.733 --> 06:00.068
Maybe he thought
he would take over the business.

06:00.152 --> 06:02.613
My father's aspirations for me
were no doubt

06:02.696 --> 06:04.656
that I should make very good chicken soup.

06:04.740 --> 06:07.117
There wasn't a lot of, you know, "Let's go
to the circus. Let's go to the muse--"

06:07.201 --> 06:08.452
There was none of that.

06:08.535 --> 06:11.872
I know she is gone
But my love…

06:11.955 --> 06:14.374
Early music training was classical piano.

06:15.250 --> 06:20.589
I first picked up a guitar probably
10 or 11, and I took one lesson.

06:20.672 --> 06:23.091
I think I had brought in
"Blue Suede Shoes"

06:23.175 --> 06:25.093
and said, "Teach me how to play this."

06:25.177 --> 06:27.471
That's not really, I think,
what they were there for.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.891
So that was the end of my music lesson,

06:32.142 --> 06:34.937
so I learned guitar from the--
playing along with records.

06:39.358 --> 06:44.154
Doo-wop. The Paragons, the Jesters,
the Diablos.

06:44.238 --> 06:46.156
And rockabilly.

06:48.325 --> 06:49.952
And Lou always said to me

06:50.035 --> 06:54.206
that he wanted to ultimately
become a rock star very early on.

06:54.289 --> 06:55.541
This was in high school.

07:06.051 --> 07:10.264
When I was 14, I made my first record,
"Leave Her for Me."

07:10.347 --> 07:12.599
The final disappointment for me

07:12.683 --> 07:15.394
was the night Murray the K
was supposed to play it on the radio,

07:15.477 --> 07:17.104
and he was sick.

07:17.187 --> 07:20.858
Paul Sherman played it instead,
and I was absolutely devastated.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.693
We were all sitting by the radio.

07:23.277 --> 07:26.321
And we got a royalty check for $2.79,

07:26.405 --> 07:29.741
which in fact turned out to be a lot more
than I made with the Velvet Underground.

07:31.785 --> 07:33.579
Take all the blossoms…

07:33.662 --> 07:35.330
There was a place called the Hayloft,

07:35.414 --> 07:37.416
and he used to go there alone to play.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.460
Leave me my baby

07:40.544 --> 07:43.088
It was known to be a gay nightclub.

07:43.172 --> 07:47.259
I once asked him why he wanted
to play in gay nightclubs.

07:47.342 --> 07:49.386
And he said
it's just a cool group of people.

07:49.469 --> 07:53.182
Please leave her for me
Leave my baby

07:53.265 --> 07:55.225
The band booked gigs in the city.

07:55.309 --> 07:57.436
He was still in high school.

07:57.519 --> 08:01.523
And I think that certainly that set
the ground for difficulties in my home.

08:21.376 --> 08:23.754
We were living in my grandmother's house.

08:23.837 --> 08:27.424
And my grandmother
was very thoroughly nationalistic.

08:27.508 --> 08:31.011
One thing she didn't like was that
my mother had married an Englishman

08:31.094 --> 08:33.514
and didn't speak Welsh.

08:33.597 --> 08:36.308
Not only did she marry an Englishman,
she married a coal miner,

08:36.390 --> 08:39.686
which she spent years
pushing all the other kids out of.

08:39.770 --> 08:44.441
She made sure that all her boys
and my mother all went into education.

08:46.485 --> 08:49.029
When they got married and my father
moved into the house,

08:49.112 --> 08:51.448
my grandmother banned the use
of English in the house.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.909
Until I learned English in school
at seven,

08:53.992 --> 08:55.827
I couldn't communicate with my father.

08:57.788 --> 09:00.707
The antipathy
that I got from my grandmother

09:00.791 --> 09:02.793
was really some form of hatred.

09:03.961 --> 09:05.128
A little bit grim.

09:06.588 --> 09:09.216
My mother taught me piano
for a little while

09:09.299 --> 09:11.218
until I got to a certain point,

09:11.301 --> 09:13.554
and then she turned me over
to somebody else.

09:13.637 --> 09:15.389
Yeah, she held it together for me.

09:15.472 --> 09:18.642
I mean, I'm talking about, like,
maybe at six or seven years of age.

09:21.937 --> 09:24.356
The life of the imagination
was the life of the radio.

09:25.148 --> 09:28.902
And by that time, I'd figured out the way
that I really could use the radio

09:28.986 --> 09:32.698
was to tune into all
the foreign broadcasts.

09:32.781 --> 09:35.826
Get Suisse Romande and Radio Moscow.

09:37.703 --> 09:42.332
When I got to grammar school, they had
an orchestra, and I wanted to play.

09:42.416 --> 09:45.836
So I went looking for a violin,
and they didn't have any violins.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.130
But they had a viola, so I got the viola.

09:48.922 --> 09:52.968
They had Bach pieces,
cello pieces for viola.

09:53.051 --> 09:55.888
Which was really good.
You got all your chops going.

09:55.971 --> 09:59.683
But then there was
the Paganini Caprices…

09:59.766 --> 10:02.311
that I sort of stunned my teacher

10:02.394 --> 10:05.022
saying that I was gonna learn
the Paganini Caprices.

10:09.026 --> 10:11.695
My mother, she had an operation
on her breasts.

10:11.778 --> 10:15.866
She disappears and goes to
this isolation hospital

10:15.949 --> 10:19.119
which had 25-foot walls outside.

10:19.203 --> 10:22.289
And my father would take me up
and hold me up.

10:24.333 --> 10:25.501
She vanished.

10:26.418 --> 10:28.754
Things started going off the rails.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.047
I was on my own.

10:30.589 --> 10:34.259
My father kept going to work.
I mean, I just felt very isolated.

10:36.053 --> 10:38.555
I couldn't talk to my father about
any of the things that were going on.

10:38.639 --> 10:41.391
I couldn't talk to my mother
about what was going on.

10:41.475 --> 10:46.355
So I got taken advantage of,
and I didn't know what to do about it.

10:49.399 --> 10:51.693
I had this piece that I remembered
the opening of the piece,

10:51.777 --> 10:53.654
but I didn't remember the ending of it.

10:53.737 --> 10:55.781
So I had to improvise my way
through the ending of it.

10:55.864 --> 10:58.408
I mean, I did a pretty good job
of ending the piece.

10:58.492 --> 11:02.496
I mean, of really carving an arc for it,
and I got out of it.

11:03.080 --> 11:06.583
When I came out of that room,
at first I was really scared.

11:07.167 --> 11:10.295
And I didn't know what the hell was
gonna happen, but then it happened.

11:10.379 --> 11:12.130
That moment of it happening,

11:12.214 --> 11:15.092
that was what made a difference
really early on

11:15.175 --> 11:18.220
about how to work your way
out of a problem.

11:18.303 --> 11:23.141
Being afraid of what's about to happen
is not a problem.

11:23.225 --> 11:25.102
It was the birth of improvisation.

11:31.650 --> 11:35.153
Slowly, things started focusing on
what I was planning on doing.

11:35.904 --> 11:38.407
And I think I'd really made
a practical decision.

11:38.490 --> 11:40.742
I thought, "I want to be a conductor."

11:42.828 --> 11:45.998
In addition, it was really clear
that I had to get out of the valleys.

11:46.081 --> 11:49.668
You know, there's nothing here.
I was desperate to get out of that place.

11:50.210 --> 11:53.964
But if it wasn't for that one time
when I got scared out of my wits

11:54.047 --> 11:57.968
and had to perform and finish
something off elegantly.

12:00.804 --> 12:02.556
That really stood me in good stead.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.914
You killed your European son

12:27.956 --> 12:30.250
You spit on those under 21

12:30.876 --> 12:32.711
But now your blue cars are gone

12:32.794 --> 12:36.006
You better say so long
Hey, hey, hey, bye, bye, bye

12:36.089 --> 12:38.258
New York, during the wartime,

12:38.342 --> 12:44.181
became a place where artists escaped.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.975
So it was a meeting of New York

12:47.059 --> 12:52.022
and the best artists' minds
from Paris and from Berlin.

12:52.105 --> 12:55.067
You better say so long
Your clowns bid you goodbye

12:56.818 --> 13:01.490
New York at the end of the '50s.
And now we are going to the '60s.

13:06.703 --> 13:11.542
While French Nouvelle Vague
had Cinémathèque Française,

13:12.376 --> 13:14.878
we had our 42nd Street.

13:15.838 --> 13:18.632
Every night we went to 42nd Street,

13:18.715 --> 13:23.220
where there were, like, 15 other--
no, maybe 20 movie houses.

13:25.264 --> 13:28.767
And that was the period
when all of the arts

13:28.851 --> 13:32.813
and also styles of life began changing.

13:33.438 --> 13:36.191
They climaxed into the '60s.

13:41.864 --> 13:47.786
We are not part, really, of subculture
or counterculture. We are the culture!

13:54.126 --> 13:57.087
Painters, musicians, filmmakers.

13:57.171 --> 14:02.134
They were not so much interested
in telling narrative stories.

14:03.385 --> 14:09.600
The poetic aspect of cinema brought cinema
to the level of the other arts.

14:18.859 --> 14:21.528
Beginning January '62,

14:21.612 --> 14:25.157
my studio, the Film-Makers' Cooperative,

14:25.240 --> 14:28.535
became a meeting ground
of all the filmmakers.

14:29.119 --> 14:31.413
Every evening there were screenings.

14:31.496 --> 14:34.791
And that's where Andy used to hang around.

14:34.875 --> 14:37.336
But I did not know that he was Andy.

14:37.419 --> 14:40.255
He was just sitting on the floor
with all the others.

14:41.340 --> 14:44.301
And that's where he met
his early superstars

14:44.384 --> 14:48.889
like Mario Montez
and Jack Smith and Gerard Malanga.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.808
That was Andy's film school.

15:02.903 --> 15:05.322
When I got to Goldsmiths,

15:05.405 --> 15:10.452
it was really a free-flowing
educational institution.

15:10.536 --> 15:15.290
They gave me viola lessons and
composition classes with Humphrey Searle.

15:15.374 --> 15:19.670
He understood Cage and all those
people that I was delving into.

15:19.753 --> 15:23.298
John Cage and "Water Walk."

15:27.511 --> 15:30.556
John Cage was
the leading avant-garde figure

15:30.639 --> 15:34.059
in music in New York and in America.

15:34.142 --> 15:37.813
But I think La Monte
was getting ready to take over.

15:42.359 --> 15:46.905
I got this Bernstein Fellowship.
They paid for my travel and whatever.

15:47.489 --> 15:51.702
You're in that background of-- with--
Mrs. Koussevitzky is still alive.

15:52.286 --> 15:56.123
She has afternoon soirees
for the students.

15:56.957 --> 15:59.668
Well, they wouldn't let me perform
because they were too violent.

15:59.751 --> 16:03.672
I asked Harry Kraut, who ran the program--
He asked if these pieces are violent.

16:04.631 --> 16:07.634
Most of the piece was really
being inside the piano

16:07.718 --> 16:10.220
and hitting the inside
of the piano or whatever.

16:10.304 --> 16:11.763
Then I got an ax.

16:17.186 --> 16:20.981
And I remember that one of the people
in the front row got up and ran out.

16:21.064 --> 16:23.942
And that was Mrs. Koussevitzky.
She was-- She was in tears,

16:24.026 --> 16:27.821
and I said,
"Wow, I'm really sorry that…"

16:27.905 --> 16:30.240
Yeah, she was upset for a little,
but don't worry.

16:30.324 --> 16:32.826
We took her out for cocktails afterwards.
She was fine.

16:35.871 --> 16:38.999
By that time I had met Cornelius Cardew,
and we were hanging out.

16:39.625 --> 16:43.086
You know, you had somebody who
understood what you were talking about.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.797
And Cornelius had met La Monte.

16:51.178 --> 16:54.765
La Monte Young was next in line
to take over from John Cage.

16:56.183 --> 16:58.852
Getting to Tanglewood
was my way to get to La Monte.

17:01.522 --> 17:03.023
There has been a breakdown

17:03.106 --> 17:06.484
to the point to where, you know,
it's not music anymore.

17:06.568 --> 17:07.694
We'll see you next week. Take care, now.

17:09.029 --> 17:12.449
After one had met La Monte, that was over.

17:12.532 --> 17:16.036
You know, everybody wants to do
something razzmatazz, and look at me.

17:16.994 --> 17:18.997
I was doing something that was intended

17:19.080 --> 17:21.541
to take you into a very high
spiritual state.

17:27.589 --> 17:31.051
Nobody had ever written a piece before me

17:31.134 --> 17:33.595
that consisted
of all long, sustained tones.

17:35.389 --> 17:38.183
Well, John was Welsh.

17:38.267 --> 17:40.686
He wrote us a--
He wrote us a letter from…

17:40.769 --> 17:44.565
-From Wales. Or from London maybe.
-Or Wales or the UK someplace.

17:44.648 --> 17:46.191
Someplace in the UK,

17:46.275 --> 17:47.818
and he said he wanted
to come over and study and…

17:47.901 --> 17:48.902
Yeah.

17:49.820 --> 17:52.114
-We-- I guess we said he could.
-Sure.

17:53.740 --> 17:56.368
I didn't get to New York until 1963.

17:56.869 --> 18:01.582
And it was my first time in New York,
and I was appalled. It was…

18:01.665 --> 18:03.792
You know, the steam
coming up from the sidewalks.

18:04.543 --> 18:07.504
"Holy shit. This place is filthy."

18:10.132 --> 18:13.760
So really La Monte's drones
and all of that was reassuring.

18:14.219 --> 18:16.638
Here we were back in music,

18:16.722 --> 18:19.808
focusing on what-- what are we gonna hear.

18:19.892 --> 18:25.772
We're hearing drone, but really,
we were studying natural harmonics.

18:30.527 --> 18:35.574
I got a call from Lou, and he said
to me that he was very depressed.

18:35.657 --> 18:37.784
He said he was taking some treatments.

18:38.327 --> 18:43.957
He thought that his parents were trying
to shock the gayness out of him.

18:45.459 --> 18:48.253
I didn't believe a word of it,
knowing his parents.

18:50.088 --> 18:52.466
Whether or not you want to say,

18:52.549 --> 18:58.096
"Well, was he was clinically depressed?
Was he using an enormous amount of drugs?"

18:59.348 --> 19:03.435
I think the tenor of the times
was not helpful.

19:03.519 --> 19:07.356
And the available help at the time
was dismal.

19:07.439 --> 19:09.942
So when you ask about Lou
in that time, I get upset.

19:10.025 --> 19:13.529
And I get upset because
of the misconceptions that take place.

19:13.612 --> 19:17.824
And because it doesn't do him service
and it doesn't do my parents service.

19:17.908 --> 19:23.622
And it is simplistic and cartoonish
to think that there's an easy explanation.

19:29.086 --> 19:30.629
He was gonna go to NYU.

19:31.797 --> 19:34.216
He made it through a semester and a half,
as I recall.

19:36.635 --> 19:41.181
He called me, and he said
that he was going to transfer to Syracuse.

19:53.694 --> 19:57.322
And when he got up to Syracuse,
he was a different person.

19:57.406 --> 19:59.741
Sullen, antagonistic.

19:59.825 --> 20:03.287
He was very rebellious
about practically everything.

20:06.123 --> 20:08.208
I had a hard time relating to him.

20:12.963 --> 20:14.965
We would get stoned, and we'd jam.

20:15.048 --> 20:19.845
We played Ray Charles, Frankie Lymon
once in a while. We played…

20:19.928 --> 20:23.724
We played fraternities
and sororities and bars.

20:23.807 --> 20:27.978
We were very bad,
so we had to change our name a lot.

20:28.061 --> 20:29.688
'Cause no one would hire us twice.

20:31.940 --> 20:35.861
There were times
when I would miss a cue or I would be off.

20:36.445 --> 20:38.906
And he would go crazy.

20:38.989 --> 20:42.201
He would turn around and smash the cymbal.

20:42.284 --> 20:44.161
He had no patience whatsoever.

20:44.244 --> 20:48.665
Any-- Anybody that wasn't absolutely
perfect and right on.

20:51.001 --> 20:53.378
We had a gig at St. Lawrence University

20:53.462 --> 20:56.381
on this boat on the Saint Lawrence River.

20:56.465 --> 20:58.133
Lou said, "I'm not playing on the boat."

20:58.217 --> 21:00.719
And I said,
"Lou, we have to play on the boat. Just"--

21:00.802 --> 21:03.096
He said, "I'm not." Boom!

21:03.180 --> 21:08.519
And he puts his hand through a glass pane
in a door and rips his hand up.

21:08.602 --> 21:11.730
So we had to take him to the hospital.
He gets stitches.

21:11.813 --> 21:15.067
And, if I remember, it was his right hand.

21:15.150 --> 21:17.444
So he said,
"Well, fuck you, I can't play."

21:17.528 --> 21:21.156
I said, "You can sing,
and you're a shitty guitar player anyway,

21:21.240 --> 21:22.991
so you'll be covered."

21:23.075 --> 21:25.452
And we did.

21:25.536 --> 21:27.621
He was like a three-year-old in many ways.

21:28.872 --> 21:30.707
Whoa, hey, merry-go-round

21:30.791 --> 21:34.002
We made a demo record called "Your Love."

21:34.086 --> 21:36.129
Your little love

21:36.213 --> 21:39.007
Your love, your little love

21:39.758 --> 21:43.804
I never thought I was a real whole man
Till your love

21:43.887 --> 21:47.766
We went to a meeting in the city

21:47.850 --> 21:51.812
with a guy who liked
some of Lou's demo tapes.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.648
And he turned to Lou, and he said to him,

21:54.731 --> 21:58.193
"So, what is it that you wanna do?
What do you want to accomplish?"

21:58.277 --> 22:02.364
He said, "I wanna be rich,
and I wanna be a rock star.

22:02.447 --> 22:06.118
And I'm going to be rich,
and I'm going to be a rock star

22:06.201 --> 22:08.036
whether you handle my music or not."

22:08.120 --> 22:12.624
He was not comfortable in most places.

22:12.708 --> 22:14.543
And if he wasn't comfortable
to begin with,

22:14.626 --> 22:18.881
he really took advantage of it and
made everybody else uncomfortable.

22:18.964 --> 22:20.507
So that that was his comfort.

22:20.591 --> 22:24.636
I don't know why he was so insecure,
but I think he was terribly insecure.

22:24.720 --> 22:27.681
And I think he was insecure all his life.

22:28.640 --> 22:32.019
He was always very angry at people
for rejecting him,

22:33.103 --> 22:35.814
and so he was gonna
cut that friendship off first.

22:41.653 --> 22:47.534
In the dark church of music
which never is of land or sea alone

22:47.618 --> 22:51.246
But blooms within the air inside the mind

22:51.330 --> 22:57.044
Patterns in motion and action
Successions of processionals

22:57.127 --> 23:00.255
Moving with majesty of certainty

23:00.339 --> 23:02.674
To part the unparted curtains…

23:02.758 --> 23:05.052
And he's hanging out with Delmore by then.

23:07.554 --> 23:10.390
The person I looked up to the most
was Delmore Schwartz.

23:10.474 --> 23:15.020
I studied poetry with him,
but there were other things.

23:15.103 --> 23:17.981
These astonishing little essays
and short stories.

23:19.149 --> 23:25.989
I was amazed that someone could do that
with such simple, everyday language.

23:26.657 --> 23:29.701
And Delmore Schwartz thought Lou had
a tremendous amount of talent

23:29.785 --> 23:32.538
and, as a matter of fact,
got a number of his poems published

23:32.621 --> 23:34.039
in the Evergreen Review.

23:34.623 --> 23:39.628
And his poetry was very heavy
on gay themes.

23:39.711 --> 23:41.421
Very dark gay themes.

23:41.505 --> 23:47.427
The idea of meeting men
in public bathrooms,

23:47.511 --> 23:53.559
having sex with a man near a urinal
and folding that into a poem.

23:53.642 --> 23:56.186
And when I read the-- one of these poems,

23:56.270 --> 23:59.273
and I said to him--
I said, "Lou, what the fuck?

24:00.148 --> 24:05.279
Where-- Where does all of this
degrading idea of sex come from?"

24:06.238 --> 24:10.450
He said, "If it's not dark and if it's not
degrading, it's not hot. It's not sex."

24:10.993 --> 24:13.078
He said,
"You couldn't possibly understand it.

24:13.161 --> 24:15.038
You're becoming a Republican."

24:18.667 --> 24:21.962
Must've been Thanksgiving
or Christmas when we went to the Hayloft.

24:22.921 --> 24:25.757
I don't remember much about it,
other than it was a gay bar.

24:27.718 --> 24:32.472
There was a girl there named Action.
He tried to set me up with this girl.

24:33.182 --> 24:35.684
And I said, "Yeah, I'm not gay.
I don't wanna be gay.

24:35.767 --> 24:37.978
I don't wanna experiment.
I'm not interested."

24:38.437 --> 24:41.648
And he said, "Go dance with her." So,
"Oh, okay, I'll dance with her," you know.

24:43.150 --> 24:46.153
I think he took me there just to show me
where he was and what he did.

24:47.362 --> 24:49.239
And people said,
"Well, why didn't you care about that?

24:49.323 --> 24:52.201
How could you, you know,
be with him if he's with a guy?"

24:52.284 --> 24:54.411
And I said,
"That has nothing to do with me."

24:54.494 --> 24:57.623
And I'm not jealous.
It just didn't bother me.

25:00.042 --> 25:04.129
Much more horrifying was driving
into Manhattan, to Harlem,

25:04.213 --> 25:05.923
to pick up some-- I think it was heroin.

25:06.006 --> 25:08.884
And we'd go to literally
125th and Saint Nicholas.

25:08.967 --> 25:10.928
Go up into this apartment house.

25:11.011 --> 25:15.307
He liked very much taking me
to a place that was not safe.

25:16.683 --> 25:18.560
And he was just setting up a scenario

25:18.644 --> 25:21.271
that then he would have material
to write about.

25:23.649 --> 25:25.025
He was always writing.

25:25.108 --> 25:29.571
He was always writing either a story
or lyrics or a song.

25:29.655 --> 25:32.908
But he always was very clear
that there's no difference

25:32.991 --> 25:38.455
between being a writer of a book
and a writer of lyrics.

25:40.958 --> 25:47.047
Seventeen Voznesenskys
are groaning yet voiceless.

25:47.840 --> 25:51.552
My cries have been torn

25:51.635 --> 25:57.391
onto miles of magnetic tape
and endless red tongue.

25:57.474 --> 26:03.313
When I was in college,
I was very influenced by Ginsberg.

26:03.397 --> 26:06.108
"Howl," "Kaddish."

26:06.191 --> 26:08.026
Burroughs's Naked Lunch.

26:08.110 --> 26:11.697
Hubert Selby Jr., Last Exit to Brooklyn.

26:11.780 --> 26:15.909
I thought, "That's what I wanna do,
except with a drum and guitar."

26:15.993 --> 26:17.995
So, "I don't know just where I'm going

26:19.162 --> 26:21.582
I'm gonna try for the kingdom if I can

26:22.291 --> 26:24.334
Because it makes me feel like I'm a man

26:25.502 --> 26:27.546
When I put a spike into my vein

26:27.629 --> 26:30.632
All, you know, things
Aren't quite the same

26:30.716 --> 26:34.344
When I'm rushing on my run
And I feel like Jesus's son

26:34.428 --> 26:37.639
And I guess I just don't know
I guess I just don't know."

26:43.770 --> 26:45.772
Probably there's never been a problem

26:45.856 --> 26:50.027
in human behavior or misbehavior
that's been with us quite so long

26:50.110 --> 26:53.155
or has been so little understood
as homosexuality.

26:58.994 --> 27:01.747
In your estimation,
what's the most serious sex crime?

27:02.956 --> 27:04.541
The crime against nature.

27:07.794 --> 27:10.380
What are the penalties
for a crime against nature?

27:10.464 --> 27:13.300
The maximum sentence
is 20 years in the state penitentiary.

27:15.844 --> 27:19.097
You know,
we got arrested for being in bars.

27:19.181 --> 27:21.016
But so what? It was part of it.

27:24.853 --> 27:26.730
There was a bar called the San Remo

27:26.813 --> 27:31.026
that everyone seemed sort of gay,

27:31.109 --> 27:34.738
extremely smart and/or creative.

27:34.821 --> 27:39.868
And they turned out to be Edward Albee
and Andy Warhol and Jasper Johns

27:39.952 --> 27:44.665
and at the center of it
is the exploding art world.

27:45.666 --> 27:49.628
Money, parties, power.

27:50.420 --> 27:52.047
Cinema is exploding.

27:52.130 --> 27:54.716
The New York Film Festival,
Lincoln Center,

27:54.800 --> 27:57.553
all that is happening in the mid-'60s.

27:57.636 --> 28:03.684
And it was an outrageous… over-camp.

28:04.434 --> 28:09.690
I mean, camp was something
that you really played with

28:09.773 --> 28:11.358
like Jack Smith did.

28:24.830 --> 28:28.834
Lo, it was a super--
a super overstimulated night

28:28.917 --> 28:32.588
on the eve of the world's destruction.

28:32.671 --> 28:35.966
And at 56 Ludlow Street,

28:36.049 --> 28:42.681
I, Jack Smith, met Angus and Tony.

28:42.764 --> 28:45.225
Tony Conrad, he took the apartment

28:45.309 --> 28:49.396
at 56 Ludlow Street
which became so important.

28:49.479 --> 28:52.441
I didn't want to be a part
of the economy,

28:52.524 --> 28:58.280
so I lived in an apartment
that cost $25.44 a month.

28:58.363 --> 29:02.618
When you crossed over,
it created a very strange change

29:02.701 --> 29:06.955
between Lower East Side documentary,
avant-garde lifestyle

29:07.039 --> 29:11.877
and then the formal art scene
of the-- what became Soho.

29:13.337 --> 29:15.214
Jack, I guess, moved in with him.

29:15.297 --> 29:19.092
The neighbors next door
were Piero Heliczer and his wife Kate.

29:19.176 --> 29:22.137
Then Angus MacLise came back to New York,

29:22.221 --> 29:25.933
and he ended up in a third apartment
on the same floor at 56 Ludlow.

29:26.016 --> 29:30.312
And then also Mario Montez
lived in the building. John…

29:30.395 --> 29:32.523
John Cale moved in with Tony.

29:36.527 --> 29:39.905
But that Ludlow Street core

29:39.988 --> 29:45.494
became the Dream Syndicate
with La Monte Young.

29:45.577 --> 29:47.871
La Monte, Marian and Tony and I,

29:47.955 --> 29:51.375
for a year and a half, we did this
for an hour and a half every day.

29:52.042 --> 29:56.171
I've held a drone.
And it was a discipline,

29:56.255 --> 29:59.007
and it opened your eyes
to a lot of possibilities.

30:00.759 --> 30:04.429
Each frequency is perceived

30:04.513 --> 30:07.307
at a different point
on the cerebral cortex.

30:07.391 --> 30:12.938
So when you set up a group of frequencies
that are repeated over and over,

30:13.021 --> 30:18.986
it establishes a psychological state
that can be very strong and profound.

30:20.028 --> 30:23.574
You can hear details
in the harmonic series

30:24.575 --> 30:29.329
that are extraordinarily beautiful
and unusual.

30:30.747 --> 30:32.875
And you begin to realize

30:32.958 --> 30:38.422
that there are new places in sound
that you could find a home.

30:43.093 --> 30:46.513
We never had to worry about,
"Give me an A. Let's"-- No.

30:46.597 --> 30:52.853
We found the most stable
thing that we could tune to

30:52.936 --> 30:56.857
was the 60-cycle hum of the refrigerator.

30:57.858 --> 31:03.197
Because 60-cycle hum was to us
the drone of Western civilization.

31:07.326 --> 31:10.537
So the fundamental, that is,
the key that we're in,

31:10.621 --> 31:14.875
if we're using the third harmonic
as 60 cycles, is ten cycles.

31:14.958 --> 31:16.877
And, lo and behold, ten cycles is--

31:16.960 --> 31:19.796
is the alpha rhythm of the brain
when you're asleep.

31:22.382 --> 31:25.052
All of a sudden,
"Hey, there's a story here."

31:27.888 --> 31:30.766
The interesting thing about
the Dream Syndicate

31:30.849 --> 31:32.935
was, of course, it was minimalist music.

31:34.144 --> 31:37.272
Full scale, hold one note,

31:37.356 --> 31:40.234
and listen to all the intonations in it.

31:41.610 --> 31:46.365
La Monte Young would
stretch one note into four hours.

31:46.448 --> 31:49.243
I went with Andy
to one of his performances.

32:06.802 --> 32:11.014
Before I had gone to the Factory,
I had seen Warhol's Kiss.

32:13.809 --> 32:15.853
There were no titles.

32:15.936 --> 32:18.647
I had no idea who had made it.

32:18.730 --> 32:22.693
And it was a weekly serial,
so that every week,

32:22.776 --> 32:25.904
a two-and-three-quarter-minute roll

32:25.988 --> 32:29.867
shown at proper speed,
which was 16 frames a second.

32:33.871 --> 32:37.624
The thing that's always interesting
about the Warhol silents

32:37.708 --> 32:40.711
is the reason they're unreal

32:40.794 --> 32:45.507
is they're supposed to be shown
at 16 frames a second,

32:45.591 --> 32:50.637
which means that the people
in those images are breathing

32:50.721 --> 32:55.017
and their hearts are beating
in a different time frame

32:55.100 --> 32:57.603
than yours is while you watch it.

32:57.686 --> 33:02.649
And that creates an incredible sense
of aesthetic distance.

33:10.991 --> 33:14.077
There is a post office
in the Empire State Building.

33:15.829 --> 33:21.418
And we were walking with bags of
Film Culture magazine to the post office,

33:21.502 --> 33:25.547
and we suddenly stopped
and looked at the building.

33:27.799 --> 33:33.055
I think I said, "This is a perfect iconic
image for Andy Warhol."

33:35.807 --> 33:37.518
And that's how it happened.

33:50.072 --> 33:55.452
Warhol, avant-garde film
and avant-garde music,

33:55.536 --> 33:58.580
it was all about extended time.

34:22.521 --> 34:25.190
La Monte's idea of what music was

34:25.274 --> 34:27.734
was really--
I'd say it was a Chinese idea.

34:27.818 --> 34:30.152
Yes, it's the Chinese idea of time.

34:30.862 --> 34:34.157
And really, you know,
music lasts for centuries.

34:35.701 --> 34:41.665
This was an improvisational experience
and it's kind of a religious atmosphere.

34:41.748 --> 34:43.583
And also very mysterious.

34:45.793 --> 34:52.009
And then Tony, one day, walked in
with a pickup, and that was it.

34:53.719 --> 34:56.929
We had the power with amplification.

35:02.227 --> 35:04.479
All sorts of things happened, you know?

35:05.105 --> 35:08.275
Difference tones and all that
that shake the building.

35:12.863 --> 35:15.240
I mean, it's really powerful.

35:15.324 --> 35:17.201
I mean, when we played, you know,

35:17.284 --> 35:19.661
it sounded like a B-52
was in your living room.

35:30.130 --> 35:32.049
I'm a road runner, baby

35:32.132 --> 35:34.134
And you can't keep up with me

35:36.762 --> 35:39.056
I'm a road runner, baby

35:39.640 --> 35:41.642
And you can't keep up with me

35:44.102 --> 35:46.522
Well, come on, baby, let's race

35:47.022 --> 35:48.899
Baby, baby, will you

35:48.982 --> 35:51.902
I had been collecting
rock and roll records

35:51.985 --> 35:53.403
as a kind of fetish.

35:54.905 --> 35:59.076
John was surprised to find this happening,
you know, when he moved in with me.

36:06.291 --> 36:08.669
We were listening to stuff
that was really--

36:08.752 --> 36:10.420
had more to do with what
we were doing with La Monte

36:10.504 --> 36:12.256
because of the harmonies
that were going on.

36:12.339 --> 36:14.049
The pure harmonies and all that.

36:15.092 --> 36:17.719
Hank Williams and the Everly Brothers.

36:20.013 --> 36:22.140
Dream

36:22.224 --> 36:24.309
"Dream." Dream.

36:24.393 --> 36:25.978
The way that song starts

36:26.061 --> 36:29.481
and you could hear
all the difference tones, I go, "Whoa."

36:29.565 --> 36:32.192
I was dazzled by rock and roll
by that point.

36:32.276 --> 36:34.319
I was dazzled by what the Beatles
were doing, and--

36:34.403 --> 36:36.029
and the lyrics that the Beatles
were singing.

36:36.113 --> 36:37.406
This was not childish stuff.

36:37.489 --> 36:38.949
"I know what it's like to be dead,

36:39.032 --> 36:40.909
and you're making me feel
like I've never been born."

36:40.993 --> 36:43.537
Wait a minute. That's something
that Lou would write.

36:43.620 --> 36:47.457
And out of that became
that first crazy band,

36:47.541 --> 36:50.544
which was called something
like the Primitives.

36:50.627 --> 36:56.842
And that was John
and Walter De Maria

36:56.925 --> 37:00.512
and Tony and Lou.

37:01.180 --> 37:02.681
Okay, I want everybody to settle down now.

37:02.764 --> 37:04.224
We got something new
we're gonna show you now.

37:04.308 --> 37:06.435
It's gonna knock you dead
when we come upside your head.

37:06.518 --> 37:09.646
You get ready. Said here we go.
Yeah. All right.

37:09.730 --> 37:13.108
As a staff songwriter
on a budget label in Long Island City,

37:13.775 --> 37:15.110
I moved to New York.

37:18.822 --> 37:22.868
Pickwick was a very successful
budget record company.

37:22.951 --> 37:25.120
Ninety-nine cent records.

37:25.204 --> 37:30.000
Twelve surfing songs or twelve
"we're breaking up" songs.

37:30.083 --> 37:31.835
And they would sell them at Woolworths.

37:36.590 --> 37:37.799
He had a vision.

37:37.883 --> 37:41.720
He was talented beyond his talent,
if you understand what I mean.

37:42.262 --> 37:45.224
He can't sing, he can't play,

37:45.307 --> 37:49.770
but everything he does in that
crackly voice of his resonated with me.

37:50.354 --> 37:54.608
With Lou, we were gonna blaze a trail,
which eventually he did do.

37:57.694 --> 37:59.863
Tony had got an invitation to a party.

37:59.947 --> 38:02.699
And we went up there, and this guy
comes up to us and said, "Hey.

38:02.783 --> 38:04.117
You guys look very commercial.

38:04.201 --> 38:05.869
Would you like to come
and promote a record?

38:05.953 --> 38:08.080
Now, come out to Long Island City."

38:08.163 --> 38:13.252
And it was Pickwick Records, and
their songwriter at the time was Lou Reed.

38:15.712 --> 38:19.716
When I met Lou,
there was a lot of eyeballing going on.

38:20.634 --> 38:23.762
So we had coffee, and I had my viola.

38:23.846 --> 38:25.848
Oh, one more time

38:27.349 --> 38:29.560
I was still playing
sort of classical viola

38:29.643 --> 38:33.021
with this heavy vibrato and really
sounded, like, really classical

38:33.105 --> 38:34.731
and good and all of that,

38:34.815 --> 38:39.319
and Lou said,
"Shit. I knew you had an edge on me."

38:41.530 --> 38:43.657
Everybody get down on your face now

38:43.740 --> 38:45.409
Are you ready?

38:45.492 --> 38:48.245
I wanted to do
a writing session with them.

38:48.328 --> 38:52.416
I kept saying to them that we ought
to write on the fly,

38:52.499 --> 38:54.585
which they all liked.

38:54.668 --> 38:57.671
And interestingly enough,
he was the key to that.

38:57.754 --> 39:02.926
He was a songwriter, and he started
to play the lick. And I loved it.

39:03.010 --> 39:07.598
And then immediately John
and all of them, they were with it.

39:07.681 --> 39:09.975
And that's where we did "The Ostrich,"

39:10.058 --> 39:12.311
where many, many great producers

39:12.394 --> 39:16.398
like Warren Thompson
of Elektra Records loved that.

39:16.481 --> 39:20.110
-Do the ostrich
-Whoa-whoa-whoa whoa, yeah

39:20.194 --> 39:23.614
You turn to the left
And then you feet upside your left

39:24.489 --> 39:25.532
You did great.

39:26.491 --> 39:29.077
The song had been written
on a guitar that was tuned to one note.

39:29.161 --> 39:33.957
There was tremendous noise from the guitar
and Lou doing tambourine and singing.

39:34.041 --> 39:36.001
And he was totally spontaneous.

39:36.084 --> 39:38.879
Exactly what you think of
when you think of guys in--

39:38.962 --> 39:41.882
in a garage doing stuff like that.

39:41.965 --> 39:43.425
And it was great.

39:43.509 --> 39:45.552
Yeah, I missed that in my childhood.

39:48.096 --> 39:51.350
Then we're on the same bill
with Shirley Ellis or--

39:51.433 --> 39:54.269
"Bo-nana-bana fee-fo-fum."
You know that-- that song?

39:54.353 --> 39:58.273
And the DJ said, "Yay! That's great.
Now we have this band here."

39:58.357 --> 40:00.901
He said, "It's the Primitives
right from New York City

40:00.984 --> 40:03.195
with their latest hit song 'The Ostrich.'"

40:06.573 --> 40:12.287
I felt that this was like
an almost magical mistake.

40:12.371 --> 40:14.998
It was such a displacement.

40:15.082 --> 40:21.630
I never saw this as a vehicle
for my serious music efforts.

40:23.215 --> 40:27.511
At Pickwick, I will tell you that he had
a tremendous track record

40:27.594 --> 40:31.890
of being high, of being sick,

40:31.974 --> 40:37.604
of falling down, of having me
have to rush him over to a hospital.

40:38.397 --> 40:41.650
Frankly,
that was one of the reasons why I,

40:41.733 --> 40:46.572
as much as I thought he was talented,
I wanted to end the relationship also.

40:47.072 --> 40:51.326
And Lou said, "They won't let me
record the songs I wanna do."

40:51.827 --> 40:54.705
And that was, like, red to a bull.
I said, "What?"

40:55.497 --> 40:58.083
And I said, "What are the songs
that you wanna--"

40:58.166 --> 40:59.960
And he showed me these other songs.

41:00.043 --> 41:03.297
I was writing about pain.

41:03.380 --> 41:06.383
And I was writing about things that hurt.

41:06.466 --> 41:11.054
And I was writing about reality as I
knew it, or friends of mine had known,

41:11.138 --> 41:13.891
or things I had seen, or heard, or--

41:13.974 --> 41:18.937
I was interested in communicating
to people who were on the outside.

41:19.021 --> 41:20.355
He said, "Why won't they play?"

41:20.439 --> 41:22.274
Because people will complain
about these songs

41:22.357 --> 41:25.027
being about advocating the use of drugs.

41:25.110 --> 41:26.570
But they're not about drugs.

41:26.653 --> 41:30.866
They're about guys who are sick
and dissatisfied with their lives.

41:30.949 --> 41:32.534
Why don't we go do it ourselves?

41:32.618 --> 41:39.541
In 1964, that same apartment on Ludlow,
then it was now Cale and Reed.

41:39.625 --> 41:42.461
"I'm Waiting for the Man."
Words and music Lou Reed.

41:58.560 --> 42:01.939
It's useful for you to be antagonistic

42:02.606 --> 42:05.651
because you define a position

42:05.734 --> 42:10.447
and you define the opposite position
and build something out of that.

42:11.698 --> 42:14.117
The thing that we understood where we were

42:14.201 --> 42:17.412
and how much disdain we had
for everything else, and it worked.

42:17.496 --> 42:20.707
Oh, pardon me, sir
Nothing could be further from my mind

42:20.791 --> 42:22.751
But I'm just waiting for a dear
Dear friend of mine

42:22.835 --> 42:26.004
Yeah, he was always saying, "Shit, man.

42:26.088 --> 42:30.092
How the fuck did this happen? From Wales?"

42:31.718 --> 42:35.180
He showed me the lyrics for "Venus
in Furs" and "I'm Waiting for the Man,"

42:35.264 --> 42:39.059
and I thought these were really coherent,
well-crafted lyrics.

42:39.142 --> 42:44.439
But I said, "Wait, the music is not
backing up what these lyrics are about."

42:44.523 --> 42:46.692
And I got very excited
and I think I got Lou excited

42:46.775 --> 42:48.402
about what the possibilities were.

42:49.444 --> 42:53.532
And we went through all sorts
of different calibrations

42:53.615 --> 42:57.828
of trios, quartets, whatever.

43:21.059 --> 43:23.228
Shiny, shiny…

43:23.312 --> 43:28.609
He was on a subway one day and he
met Sterling with no shoes on in winter,

43:28.692 --> 43:31.028
and he hadn't seen him since Syracuse.

43:39.328 --> 43:42.539
Well, I'm sure he saw Lou
play with his band at Syracuse,

43:42.623 --> 43:44.208
and I'm sure he wanted in.

43:45.083 --> 43:47.127
I think he just wanted to do it.
He was ready.

43:47.211 --> 43:49.880
He'd been playing
since he was 15, taught himself.

43:49.963 --> 43:52.966
He was always
holding his guitar at parties,

43:53.050 --> 43:57.471
and that's what he wanted to do.
And… there was the chance.

43:58.180 --> 44:01.725
All of a sudden we had a guitar player
who really thought about his guitar solos.

44:02.184 --> 44:04.478
Lou and I would sit around,
and we'd improvise.

44:04.561 --> 44:07.147
And Sterling would solo.

44:08.106 --> 44:11.902
You know, he played really good,
like, Isley Brothers guitar.

44:12.611 --> 44:16.031
He was very natural and gentle.

44:18.408 --> 44:24.581
The idea that you can combine R & B
and Wagner was around the corner.

44:33.757 --> 44:36.552
I was driving home from class one day

44:36.635 --> 44:41.306
and "Not Fade Away" came
on the radio, the Stones version,

44:41.390 --> 44:46.144
and pulled off the road 'cause it was
just too exciting to just keep driving.

44:48.772 --> 44:50.774
They were looking for a drummer,

44:50.858 --> 44:53.861
and I said,
"Well, Jim's sister plays the drums."

44:54.736 --> 44:56.488
And I drove Lou out to meet her.

44:58.282 --> 45:01.410
And Maureen was
the sister of an old friend of mine,

45:01.493 --> 45:06.081
who also went to Syracuse
and who also was friends with Lou.

45:06.164 --> 45:11.170
And Maureen had been playing
with a girls' band in Long Island,

45:11.253 --> 45:12.713
and they broke up.

45:13.755 --> 45:16.258
So she just came in to do,

45:16.341 --> 45:18.260
I don't know,
just to do a little percussion,

45:18.343 --> 45:20.762
and just fool around.

45:20.846 --> 45:23.056
I don't know. It was very casual.

45:25.142 --> 45:27.769
And when she'd come home
at night, like 5:00,

45:27.853 --> 45:29.438
she'd put on Bo Diddley records

45:29.521 --> 45:31.940
and, like, play every night
from 5:00 to 12:00.

45:32.024 --> 45:34.651
And so we figured she'd be
the perfect drummer. And she was.

45:35.777 --> 45:38.906
It was fun, and I really was excited

45:38.989 --> 45:42.492
to have the opportunity
to play live with people.

45:42.576 --> 45:45.495
I'd never played with anybody before.
So that was fun.

45:49.082 --> 45:51.710
The way we could give Bob Dylan
a run for his money

45:51.793 --> 45:55.130
was to go out onstage and improvise
different songs every night.

45:55.214 --> 45:56.715
And Lou was expert at this.

45:56.798 --> 46:00.052
He could just improvise lyrics
at a drop of a hat about anything.

46:00.719 --> 46:04.306
He could come and sit down
with the guitar and I'd play the viola,

46:04.389 --> 46:06.016
and he would start a song.

46:08.143 --> 46:11.772
Up would pop a lyric
that was really unusual.

46:11.855 --> 46:15.901
Then it all would roll around
and we would get something.

46:16.777 --> 46:20.697
You never knew when Lou or John
was gonna go off into nowhere land

46:20.781 --> 46:23.408
and be playing who-knows-what.

46:23.492 --> 46:25.577
I felt like my role was to be there

46:25.661 --> 46:28.664
so when they're ready to come back,
there it is.

46:29.373 --> 46:33.669
Lou, right next to me--
It was like a wall went up of sound.

46:35.754 --> 46:38.757
And I would watch his mouth to know
where we were in the song.

46:41.343 --> 46:43.428
I basically followed Lou.

46:45.097 --> 46:48.684
Apart from all the
well-crafted songs that he would write,

46:48.767 --> 46:51.103
this improvisation was what
I was interested in.

46:54.857 --> 46:58.485
Strongly influenced by coming directly
from the subconscious.

46:58.569 --> 47:02.322
And when I heard Lou's tales
of shock therapy,

47:03.115 --> 47:05.951
I kind of put it all together in my head.

47:08.954 --> 47:11.456
The way that struck a chord
mainly with the music

47:11.540 --> 47:14.626
was the music was really dream music.

47:16.587 --> 47:20.757
And what I really liked in most of
the rock and roll that was going on

47:20.841 --> 47:23.427
was the repetitive nature of the riffs,

47:23.510 --> 47:26.138
and what was the one riff
that you could create

47:26.221 --> 47:31.351
that would exist and live happily
throughout the entire song.

47:32.269 --> 47:34.479
And drone was obviously one of them.

47:59.505 --> 48:01.840
When we formed the Velvet Underground

48:01.924 --> 48:06.470
I had some songs and having them
come to life like that, that was amazing.

48:07.679 --> 48:10.516
I mean, I was a guy playing in bar bands.

48:14.770 --> 48:16.730
In most collaborations,

48:16.813 --> 48:18.815
it's when you put two and two
together and get seven.

48:20.943 --> 48:24.404
That weirdness, it shouldn't have
existed in this space.

48:25.948 --> 48:29.076
And there was always a standard
that was kind of set

48:30.160 --> 48:34.164
for how to be elegant
and how to be brutal.

48:48.345 --> 48:53.475
Shiny, shiny, shiny boots of leather

48:55.060 --> 48:59.356
Whiplash girlchild in the dark

49:01.650 --> 49:06.905
Comes in bells, your servant
Don't forsake him

49:08.156 --> 49:12.870
Strike, dear mistress
And cure his heart

49:24.798 --> 49:27.217
I am tired

49:28.093 --> 49:29.887
I am weary

49:31.221 --> 49:36.226
I could sleep for a thousand years

49:37.603 --> 49:43.066
A thousand dreams that would awake me

49:44.651 --> 49:47.738
The drone fit in as soon
as "Venus in Furs" hit, you know.

49:47.821 --> 49:51.325
I knew that we had a way
of doing something in rock and roll

49:51.408 --> 49:52.659
that nobody else had done.

49:55.078 --> 50:00.292
And all that was done with detuned guitars
that I was really proud of,

50:00.375 --> 50:02.127
because I'd say, "Hey, Lou.

50:02.211 --> 50:04.880
Nobody's gonna be able to figure out
how the hell to do this."

50:06.048 --> 50:09.009
In some ways I was surprised
by the response in New York.

50:09.092 --> 50:12.012
I thought we did something
no one else did.

50:12.095 --> 50:15.891
Shiny leather in the dark

50:16.808 --> 50:21.021
I thought what we did was so brave

50:21.104 --> 50:24.399
that people would really
just be bowled over by it.

50:24.483 --> 50:30.197
Strike, dear mistress
And cure his heart

50:30.280 --> 50:32.866
Café Bizarre, very small thing.

50:33.492 --> 50:35.744
We were real excited
that they had this job.

50:36.578 --> 50:40.916
Not too many people there.
Nobody dancing. Very weird.

50:40.999 --> 50:43.460
Some had their backs to the crowd.

50:45.295 --> 50:47.923
They had this off-putting aura.

50:48.882 --> 50:51.260
You know, yikes, they were scary.

50:57.432 --> 51:01.478
Barbara Rubin was one of these
elite downtown filmmakers.

51:01.562 --> 51:04.356
Really knew Bob Dylan, knew Andy.

51:04.439 --> 51:07.651
She worked very hard
to put people together.

51:07.734 --> 51:11.154
She came into the Factory and announced
there was a band downtown

51:11.238 --> 51:13.198
that they should really come and see.

51:14.533 --> 51:17.202
Suddenly,
many more people were in the club.

51:23.542 --> 51:26.461
Gerard was the diplomatic face
of the Factory.

51:26.545 --> 51:28.589
And he came to me and said,

51:28.672 --> 51:31.592
"You guys are invited to come up
to the Factory tomorrow afternoon."

51:41.059 --> 51:43.854
Barbara Rubin brings them in,
they're all dressed in black…

51:45.731 --> 51:47.024
and they started playing.

51:50.611 --> 51:53.447
They played "Heroin." We were like…

51:55.699 --> 51:57.910
Unbelievable. Just completely bowled over.

52:00.996 --> 52:06.168
The thing that was
so encouraging and inspiring

52:06.251 --> 52:10.255
when we got to the Factory
was that it was all about work.

52:12.591 --> 52:14.968
Every day when I walked in there,
he was always there ahead of me,

52:15.052 --> 52:17.429
he'd always say,
"How many songs did you write?"

52:17.513 --> 52:20.557
"I wrote ten." And he said,
"Oh, you're so lazy, you know.

52:20.641 --> 52:22.267
Why didn't you write 15?"

52:24.603 --> 52:26.313
People would come in, people would go.

52:26.396 --> 52:29.650
Faces would come in
that you'd recognize, faces would go.

52:32.945 --> 52:35.072
And it was all commerce.

52:36.949 --> 52:40.953
I don't know

52:44.331 --> 52:46.542
Just where I'm going

52:54.716 --> 52:57.135
But I'm

52:59.221 --> 53:01.682
Gonna try

53:01.765 --> 53:05.769
For the kingdom if I can

53:05.853 --> 53:09.356
'Cause it makes me feel like I'm a man

53:09.439 --> 53:12.442
When I put a spike into my vein

53:13.026 --> 53:16.321
And I tell you things
Aren't quite the same

53:16.405 --> 53:19.408
When I'm rushing on my run

53:19.491 --> 53:22.578
And I feel just like Jesus' son

53:22.661 --> 53:25.914
And I guess that I just don't know

53:25.998 --> 53:29.668
And I guess that I just don't know

53:31.461 --> 53:33.755
Andy is a divinity.

53:33.839 --> 53:37.467
He's an extraplanetary being.

53:38.343 --> 53:41.930
He was like a father
always saying, "Yes, yes, yes."

53:42.014 --> 53:47.644
That part of his character, that, I think,
made everybody come to the Factory.

53:47.728 --> 53:49.271
They felt like home.

53:49.354 --> 53:51.940
Is when the blood begins to flow

53:52.024 --> 53:55.319
When it shoots up the dropper's neck

53:55.402 --> 53:58.572
When I'm closing in on death

54:05.454 --> 54:08.957
You can't help me, not you guys

54:09.041 --> 54:11.835
Or all you sweet girls
With all your sweet talk

54:11.919 --> 54:13.420
I wanted to impress him.

54:15.005 --> 54:18.800
He was an audience.
I was desperate for an audience.

54:18.884 --> 54:21.720
All right. Just--
You don't have to do anything.

54:22.596 --> 54:24.056
Just what you're doing.

54:31.104 --> 54:32.105
That's it.

54:36.527 --> 54:37.986
There was no direction.

54:40.155 --> 54:41.240
Heroin

54:41.323 --> 54:42.991
Warhol never made a sound,

54:43.075 --> 54:45.953
but his presence started the thunder
after a while,

54:46.036 --> 54:47.663
'cause he didn't make a sound.

54:47.746 --> 54:49.665
Be the death of me

54:49.748 --> 54:51.959
So you're propelled to do something.

54:58.841 --> 55:04.263
Heroin

55:05.889 --> 55:08.767
Look straight into the camera.

55:08.851 --> 55:12.271
Try not to move. Try not to blink.

55:14.439 --> 55:16.024
It was really a skill.

55:16.108 --> 55:18.944
And then I'm better off than dead

55:38.297 --> 55:41.800
And thank God that I just don't care

55:41.884 --> 55:45.095
And I guess that I just don't know

55:45.179 --> 55:48.640
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know

55:57.191 --> 56:02.529
Heroin

56:04.656 --> 56:06.158
Be the death of me

56:06.241 --> 56:09.369
We're sponsoring a new band.
It's called the Velvet Underground.

56:09.870 --> 56:11.955
Well, since I don't really believe
in painting anymore,

56:12.039 --> 56:14.666
I thought it would be a nice way
of combining--

56:14.750 --> 56:18.712
And we have this chance
to combine music and art

56:18.795 --> 56:21.882
and films all together.

56:21.965 --> 56:24.968
And we're still working on kind of a--

56:25.052 --> 56:26.678
the biggest discotheque in the world.

56:51.453 --> 56:52.746
I'm telling you

56:53.288 --> 56:57.125
And pretty much
everything in June, in the recent past…

56:58.043 --> 57:00.921
-Is it on?
-The present shows…

57:03.340 --> 57:05.717
There's a lot of good things happening

57:05.801 --> 57:07.427
…business wise.

57:07.511 --> 57:09.680
You've got the world coming up
in this position

57:09.763 --> 57:11.598
…and that's success and a great deal

57:11.682 --> 57:13.392
…of happiness to come.

57:13.475 --> 57:15.853
And the wheel of fortune which, uh…

57:15.936 --> 57:20.691
indicates more of your, um…
ambitions and also

57:20.774 --> 57:23.610
very close friends,
people that are very close.

57:23.694 --> 57:27.155
Not much dissension going on,
ya know, right now.

57:27.906 --> 57:30.659
Ya know,
no arguments and that type of thing.

57:30.742 --> 57:32.369
That's because we're not working now.

57:32.452 --> 57:34.246
It shows a…

57:41.670 --> 57:45.841
Career, business, um…
your profession, that type of thing

57:45.924 --> 57:49.178
shows a lot of competition… always.

57:49.720 --> 57:52.806
There will always be a great deal
of competition…

57:56.351 --> 57:59.897
For the most part,
people who came to the Factory

57:59.980 --> 58:02.149
came because the cameras were running.

58:02.232 --> 58:07.738
And they thought they could become famous,
they could become stars.

58:15.245 --> 58:17.831
A very promising outlook.
A lot of new insight.

58:17.915 --> 58:19.750
And a lot of new things happening.

58:20.375 --> 58:25.714
Some ideal of female beauty,

58:26.548 --> 58:31.220
and if you didn't measure up…

58:31.303 --> 58:33.889
And who ever could measure up?

58:35.057 --> 58:36.934
That was very, very damaging.

58:38.644 --> 58:40.521
It was not a good place for women.

58:41.355 --> 58:46.068
And if you never can get past the fact
that what you were valued for

58:46.151 --> 58:47.986
is primarily your looks…

58:52.241 --> 58:54.826
then, you know.

58:57.788 --> 58:59.414
One day we were working at the Factory,

58:59.498 --> 59:02.835
and Gerard just came back from Europe.

59:02.918 --> 59:08.131
He had a 45-rpm single record,
and it was this strange voice…

59:08.215 --> 59:11.760
That I care that you love me

59:11.844 --> 59:14.471
I'm not saying that I care

59:14.555 --> 59:19.059
I'm not saying I'll be there
When you want me

59:19.142 --> 59:21.520
She had been in La Dolce Vita.

59:21.603 --> 59:23.522
Anita Ekberg was the star,

59:23.605 --> 59:28.443
but Nico was like the clandestine face
in that movie that everybody saw

59:28.527 --> 59:30.612
because she's so hauntingly beautiful.

59:35.409 --> 59:37.995
Then eventually, Nico came to New York.

59:41.206 --> 59:45.502
Paul started getting interested
in Nico in a promotional way.

59:47.045 --> 59:52.759
Somehow, Paul started convincing Andy that
you can't have just a rock and roll group,

59:52.843 --> 59:57.431
because Lou's not that much
of a big looker guy or anything,

59:57.514 --> 1:00:00.976
you know, he doesn't have a great voice.
"You gotta have a beautiful girl in it."

1:00:06.940 --> 1:00:10.777
Lou had to be just about begged
by Andy to do it.

1:00:15.866 --> 1:00:18.702
There she goes again

1:00:18.785 --> 1:00:21.622
I know it irritated them to death
in the beginning

1:00:21.705 --> 1:00:24.625
that she simply could not hold a pitch.

1:00:27.544 --> 1:00:32.174
I think it was John again who figured out
what to do with that voice.

1:00:36.178 --> 1:00:37.721
A lot of it was uncanny.

1:00:37.804 --> 1:00:39.890
In that she couldn't do this,
she couldn't do that,

1:00:39.973 --> 1:00:42.601
and then all of a sudden
she could do it all very well.

1:00:43.644 --> 1:00:45.187
I have to learn that.

1:00:54.279 --> 1:00:58.408
All of a sudden,
you realize the eye for publicity

1:00:58.492 --> 1:01:02.996
and the idea of this blonde iceberg
in the middle of the stage

1:01:03.080 --> 1:01:04.915
next to us all dressed in black.

1:01:05.499 --> 1:01:09.253
I'll be your mirror
Reflect what you are

1:01:09.336 --> 1:01:11.129
In case you don't know

1:01:11.213 --> 1:01:15.050
The three or four songs she sang
were perfect for her,

1:01:15.133 --> 1:01:18.095
and anyone else singing them,
it just doesn't work.

1:01:20.055 --> 1:01:22.975
She was always very mysterious
to us in the band.

1:01:23.058 --> 1:01:25.143
We were not widely traveled.

1:01:25.227 --> 1:01:27.938
We were not sophisticated,
except for John.

1:01:28.730 --> 1:01:30.440
Except that she could sing.

1:01:30.524 --> 1:01:34.945
She was not there
just simply to stand up and be beautiful.

1:01:35.028 --> 1:01:37.781
Please put down your hands

1:01:37.865 --> 1:01:40.617
'Cause I see you

1:01:50.419 --> 1:01:54.840
Andy had wanted her
to sing inside a plexiglass box,

1:01:54.923 --> 1:01:56.717
and Nico wasn't having it.

1:01:57.467 --> 1:02:00.304
She was a serious musician,
and she wanted to sing these songs.

1:02:01.305 --> 1:02:04.141
The spectacle of her beauty

1:02:05.184 --> 1:02:09.062
I think was completely beside the point
for her.

1:02:09.146 --> 1:02:11.565
So you won't be afraid

1:02:11.648 --> 1:02:15.652
When you think the night
Has seen your mind

1:02:16.320 --> 1:02:19.156
It might've been Andy's take on her,
you know,

1:02:19.239 --> 1:02:21.992
she's so remote, she's so unreachable.

1:02:22.075 --> 1:02:23.911
I don't think she wanted to be
super famous.

1:02:23.994 --> 1:02:27.789
I think she just wanted to make good work
that was, you know, good.

1:02:28.582 --> 1:02:29.750
'Cause I see you

1:02:29.833 --> 1:02:32.461
When you're not famous,
you get compared to whoever.

1:02:32.544 --> 1:02:36.632
You know, so she would be compared
with Marlene Dietrich or Garbo.

1:02:37.132 --> 1:02:40.260
-I'll be your mirror
-Reflect what you are

1:02:41.261 --> 1:02:43.847
-I'll be your mirror
-Reflect what you are

1:02:43.931 --> 1:02:45.641
Now they compare people to her.

1:02:45.724 --> 1:02:48.894
-I'll be your mirror
-Reflect what you are

1:02:50.771 --> 1:02:52.189
We got something from them.

1:02:52.272 --> 1:02:56.318
We met Tom Wilson,
who did-- produced Bob Dylan

1:02:56.401 --> 1:02:58.403
and we were getting somewhere.

1:02:58.487 --> 1:03:00.072
We could make a record.

1:03:00.155 --> 1:03:04.576
Norman Dolph walked in,
gave $1,500 to Andy to make the record.

1:03:05.410 --> 1:03:06.578
Wow.

1:03:07.454 --> 1:03:08.830
We were chasing something.

1:03:13.627 --> 1:03:16.922
I'm waiting for my man

1:03:21.301 --> 1:03:23.929
Twenty-six dollars in my hand

1:03:27.933 --> 1:03:31.353
Up to Lexington, 125

1:03:31.436 --> 1:03:35.440
Feel sick and dirty
More dead than alive

1:03:36.149 --> 1:03:39.278
Andy was extraordinary,
and I honestly don't think

1:03:39.361 --> 1:03:41.947
these things could've occurred
without Andy.

1:03:42.030 --> 1:03:43.699
I don't know
if we would've gotten a contract

1:03:43.782 --> 1:03:46.785
if he hadn't said he'd do the cover.
Or if Nico wasn't so beautiful.

1:03:51.039 --> 1:03:55.252
Hey, white boy
You chasin' our women around?

1:03:58.630 --> 1:04:02.050
Oh, pardon me, sir
It's furthest from my mind

1:04:03.177 --> 1:04:06.054
We rehearsed
for a year for the banana album.

1:04:08.223 --> 1:04:09.975
Andy produced our first record

1:04:10.058 --> 1:04:13.353
in the sense that he was there
breathing in the studio.

1:04:13.437 --> 1:04:15.981
But he did more than just that.

1:04:16.064 --> 1:04:18.150
He made it possible for us
to make a record

1:04:18.233 --> 1:04:22.529
without anybody changing it or everything,
because Andy Warhol was there.

1:04:25.115 --> 1:04:28.952
PR shoes and a big straw hat

1:04:29.036 --> 1:04:30.954
He understood exactly what we were about

1:04:31.038 --> 1:04:36.210
and what our creative side was all about
and how best to bring that out.

1:04:37.044 --> 1:04:39.463
And he gave us a lot of support.

1:04:39.546 --> 1:04:41.381
…gotta wait

1:04:41.465 --> 1:04:45.052
I'm waiting for my man

1:04:45.135 --> 1:04:48.680
Nico was in love with Lou.
Andy was in love with Lou.

1:04:49.473 --> 1:04:52.893
Boys and girls, men and women,
fell in love with him.

1:05:03.362 --> 1:05:06.740
I was already painting and drawing
and wanting to be understood,

1:05:06.823 --> 1:05:08.659
and was looking for a scene

1:05:08.742 --> 1:05:13.789
until a friend of mine brought over
their record when I was 15,

1:05:13.872 --> 1:05:17.125
and he wanted to trade it
'cause he-- it wasn't his taste,

1:05:17.209 --> 1:05:20.212
and I had a Fugs record
that I was willing to pass up.

1:05:20.295 --> 1:05:22.589
I loved the cadence of Lou Reed's voice.

1:05:22.673 --> 1:05:26.510
"PR shoes and a big straw hat."

1:05:28.011 --> 1:05:29.680
The-- The--

1:05:32.683 --> 1:05:35.894
And then the Cale drone underneath it.

1:05:37.145 --> 1:05:39.064
You know, and that was it.

1:05:39.147 --> 1:05:41.733
I mean, you don't want this record?
This is for me.

1:05:41.817 --> 1:05:44.152
These people would under--
the first words out of my mouth

1:05:44.236 --> 1:05:46.905
might have been,
"These people would understand me."

1:05:49.324 --> 1:05:51.702
He's got the works
Gives you sweet taste

1:05:51.785 --> 1:05:53.537
There were elements
of what Lou was doing

1:05:53.620 --> 1:05:58.333
that were just unavoidably right.
The nature of his lyric writing.

1:05:58.417 --> 1:06:03.589
Dylan had certainly brought a new kind of
intelligence to pop song writing.

1:06:03.672 --> 1:06:06.717
But then Lou had taken it
to the avant-garde

1:06:06.800 --> 1:06:10.554
and had its roots in
Baudelaire and Rimbaud and…

1:06:10.637 --> 1:06:13.473
But at that time,
it wasn't considered important.

1:06:18.645 --> 1:06:20.647
Not promoted.

1:06:20.731 --> 1:06:23.609
A lot of radio stations
wouldn't play our stuff.

1:06:23.692 --> 1:06:26.570
"Heroin" and, you know, they don't--
they wouldn't play them.

1:06:27.821 --> 1:06:29.740
But also MGM was not the--

1:06:29.823 --> 1:06:33.118
I think at that point, they had decided
that the Mothers of Invention

1:06:33.202 --> 1:06:36.872
were a better bet,
and they just didn't do much at all.

1:06:36.955 --> 1:06:39.750
Almost like they signed us
to sort of get us off the streets.

1:06:39.833 --> 1:06:42.586
Until tomorrow, but that's just
Some other time

1:06:43.670 --> 1:06:47.174
I'm waiting for my man

1:06:48.884 --> 1:06:50.302
Walk it home

1:06:58.227 --> 1:06:59.686
Oh, it's all right

1:07:01.396 --> 1:07:03.190
We've all come here together.

1:07:03.273 --> 1:07:06.026
Andy Warhol, poet Gerard Malanga.

1:07:06.109 --> 1:07:08.487
Over there, if you move your camera,
Ed Sanders

1:07:08.570 --> 1:07:10.697
of a rock and roll group called the Fugs.

1:07:10.781 --> 1:07:14.576
Peter Orlovsky, who is a poet
and who also sings Indian mantras.

1:07:14.660 --> 1:07:17.287
Jonas Mekas takes movies,
which he's doing now.

1:07:19.414 --> 1:07:22.042
In the New York area alone,

1:07:22.125 --> 1:07:25.879
there were, like, 30, 40 different artists

1:07:25.963 --> 1:07:29.967
doing something that did not stick
to their own art,

1:07:30.050 --> 1:07:32.344
but included other arts.

1:07:34.763 --> 1:07:38.100
So we organized the first such festival,

1:07:38.183 --> 1:07:41.562
like a survey in what was happening

1:07:41.645 --> 1:07:45.816
in expanded arts and expanded cinema.

1:07:45.899 --> 1:07:49.528
That was in November, December '65.

1:07:49.611 --> 1:07:55.158
In '66, I rented a theater on 41st Street

1:07:55.242 --> 1:07:58.537
in Times Square, and we continued there.

1:08:02.916 --> 1:08:07.754
That's where Chelsea Girls opened,
a lot of Warhol movies.

1:08:16.889 --> 1:08:19.975
Teenage Mary said to Uncle Dave

1:08:20.058 --> 1:08:23.478
"I sold my soul, must be saved

1:08:23.562 --> 1:08:25.731
We decided we would do
a multimedia thing,

1:08:25.814 --> 1:08:30.068
and it ran for a few weeks, and it was
called "Andy Warhol's Up-Tight."

1:08:30.652 --> 1:08:33.363
And it starred the Velvet Underground
and Gerard Malanga

1:08:33.447 --> 1:08:36.658
and Mary Woronov
doing the dancing and all.

1:08:36.742 --> 1:08:40.412
Run, run, run, run, run
Gypsy death to you

1:08:40.495 --> 1:08:42.872
Tell you whatcha do

1:08:44.082 --> 1:08:46.167
To prepare for it, we did--

1:08:46.251 --> 1:08:48.629
filmed the Velvet Underground and Nico
in the Factory,

1:08:50.130 --> 1:08:52.883
which we then, as they performed live

1:08:52.966 --> 1:08:56.553
on the stage at the cinematheque,
projected on them.

1:08:56.636 --> 1:08:59.430
Went to sell her soul, she wasn't high

1:09:00.224 --> 1:09:02.350
Didn't know, thinks she could buy it

1:09:02.434 --> 1:09:06.939
Somehow the Dom Polski
on Saint Mark's Place

1:09:07.022 --> 1:09:11.318
in the East Village
became available as a space,

1:09:11.401 --> 1:09:13.529
and we took it over for a month,

1:09:13.612 --> 1:09:19.243
and expanded "Andy Warhol's Up-Tight"
into the "Exploding Plastic Inevitable."

1:09:22.412 --> 1:09:25.290
This used to be the Polish national home.

1:09:25.374 --> 1:09:29.252
Now it's the Dom,
the center of East Village nightlife.

1:09:29.336 --> 1:09:32.339
Music by Nico and the Velvet Underground.

1:09:32.421 --> 1:09:34.550
"The Exploding Plastic Inevitable,"

1:09:34.633 --> 1:09:39.971
designed by pop-art industry, Andy Warhol,
and starring his girl of the year.

1:09:40.055 --> 1:09:43.392
Her vocal style is unusual.

1:09:48.397 --> 1:09:53.819
Andy has a group of rock
and rollers called the Velvet Underground.

1:09:56.613 --> 1:10:01.410
His idea for a discotheque
is to take a dance hall,

1:10:01.493 --> 1:10:03.954
have his musicians play,

1:10:04.037 --> 1:10:06.582
show several movies all at the same time,

1:10:06.665 --> 1:10:11.211
have colored lights going
while people dance or watch.

1:10:11.295 --> 1:10:12.671
Wild.

1:10:20.345 --> 1:10:23.807
I became Nico's guitar player
for those shows she did at the Dom.

1:10:23.891 --> 1:10:25.517
And I also did an opening set.

1:10:25.601 --> 1:10:29.396
I was not-- I didn't have a record,
I was not an attraction of any kind.

1:10:29.479 --> 1:10:30.564
I just did a set.

1:10:33.650 --> 1:10:36.653
But, I mean, no one really got there
until Andy would get there.

1:10:38.113 --> 1:10:39.364
He was the attraction.

1:10:55.130 --> 1:10:58.425
For the balcony,
Andy used to place the projectors

1:10:58.509 --> 1:11:02.596
and various gels and colors and strobes.

1:11:06.391 --> 1:11:08.519
Since no one really knew
how to use lights,

1:11:08.602 --> 1:11:10.187
we let the audience use them.

1:11:10.270 --> 1:11:11.730
That's another reason
we didn't make money,

1:11:11.813 --> 1:11:14.399
they were always breaking these things,
or they would fall off the balcony,

1:11:14.483 --> 1:11:17.861
and Andy's technique was something like…

1:11:17.945 --> 1:11:21.907
"Oh, who knows how to work the lights?
Oh, do you know how to work the lights?"

1:11:28.539 --> 1:11:30.999
People would watch his movies,

1:11:31.083 --> 1:11:33.544
but they couldn't watch 'em
'cause there's no story.

1:11:33.627 --> 1:11:37.339
So it's that weird place where,
"Is it reality or story?"

1:11:37.422 --> 1:11:40.342
And we don't know. So they were hypnotic.

1:12:14.376 --> 1:12:17.588
Upstairs it was a scene that developed.

1:12:17.671 --> 1:12:20.674
People like Walter Cronkite
and Jackie Kennedy,

1:12:20.757 --> 1:12:24.761
and a lot of the socialites showed up
down there because of Andy

1:12:24.845 --> 1:12:30.142
and because of his connections
with the Central Park West art collectors.

1:12:30.225 --> 1:12:32.561
Incredible people came and danced.

1:12:32.644 --> 1:12:34.771
Nureyev came and danced.

1:12:34.855 --> 1:12:38.025
The whole New York City Ballet
used to come and dance.

1:12:56.293 --> 1:12:59.505
I don't think they ever formed

1:12:59.588 --> 1:13:03.300
so that they would be
a spectacular stage event.

1:13:03.383 --> 1:13:09.097
They formed because there was
this amazing musical thing

1:13:09.181 --> 1:13:12.643
that happened with Lou's songs.

1:13:14.102 --> 1:13:16.855
Barbara Rubin, who discovered
them for the right reasons,

1:13:16.939 --> 1:13:21.360
is the one who started flashing
those fucking polka dots on them

1:13:21.443 --> 1:13:26.073
when they were playing,
as if they weren't enough to look at.

1:13:26.156 --> 1:13:29.618
I'd say, "Lou, you--
why are they doing this to you?"

1:13:29.701 --> 1:13:32.454
And of course, he would shrug and say,

1:13:32.538 --> 1:13:36.625
"It's what Andy will want,
and, you know, it's family."

1:13:37.417 --> 1:13:41.505
After we'd done about three weeks,
we went out on the tour.

1:13:54.351 --> 1:13:57.354
There were so many times
we'd play at some kind of art show,

1:13:57.437 --> 1:14:02.025
and they'd invited Andy and, I guess,
we're the exhibit, you know?

1:14:03.735 --> 1:14:06.989
They'd leave in droves,
these would be rich society people

1:14:07.072 --> 1:14:10.242
and artists and stuff, and this was--

1:14:10.325 --> 1:14:12.911
they didn't wanna hear a band,
let alone what we were doing.

1:14:16.081 --> 1:14:18.292
I had seen the Exploding
Plastic Inevitable show

1:14:18.375 --> 1:14:21.170
with the Velvet Underground
in New York at the Dom already.

1:14:21.253 --> 1:14:23.338
But when I was here and heard
they were coming here

1:14:23.422 --> 1:14:25.591
and in Provincetown where I lived--

1:14:25.674 --> 1:14:28.927
It was at the Chrysler Museum.
It was booked as art.

1:14:29.011 --> 1:14:31.930
It wasn't even packed, you know.
The town didn't get it.

1:14:33.515 --> 1:14:36.435
I thought it was so bizarre, in a way,
to try to imagine them

1:14:36.518 --> 1:14:38.812
coming at the height
of the hippie times and everything,

1:14:38.896 --> 1:14:40.814
when they were so anti-hippie.

1:14:50.490 --> 1:14:53.327
I know we made lots of fans
amongst those people,

1:14:53.410 --> 1:14:56.622
but we used to joke around and say,
"Well, how many people left?

1:14:56.705 --> 1:14:58.999
Oh, about half.
Oh, we must have been good tonight."

1:15:10.177 --> 1:15:12.721
It was not only noise,

1:15:12.804 --> 1:15:17.351
but the kind of music
you can hear when--

1:15:17.434 --> 1:15:20.395
when it's a storm outside.

1:15:37.871 --> 1:15:41.291
Paul then booked us into the West Coast.

1:15:46.046 --> 1:15:47.673
Monday, Monday

1:15:49.967 --> 1:15:52.302
So good to me

1:15:52.386 --> 1:15:54.221
Musically, the West Coast

1:15:54.304 --> 1:15:58.016
was an organized force that tried
to predominate in the pop scene.

1:15:58.100 --> 1:16:00.394
It was all I hoped it would be

1:16:00.477 --> 1:16:03.313
I remember we were in our rent-a-car
coming back from the airport,

1:16:03.397 --> 1:16:06.233
I turned on the radio and the first
song that came out was "Monday, Monday."

1:16:06.316 --> 1:16:08.235
I said, "Well, I don't-- I don't know.

1:16:08.318 --> 1:16:10.112
Maybe we're not ready
for this sort of thing yet."

1:16:14.283 --> 1:16:16.243
We came to Los Angeles,

1:16:16.326 --> 1:16:18.829
and the first time we noticed
that we were different

1:16:18.912 --> 1:16:22.875
was when we went to, you know,
the place, Tropicana Motel.

1:16:24.001 --> 1:16:27.671
So we're all in black,
we're all completely covered up,

1:16:27.754 --> 1:16:29.882
and we're all sitting around the pool.

1:16:29.965 --> 1:16:32.467
I mean, it looked really stupid.

1:16:32.968 --> 1:16:36.054
Except for Gerard.
Gerard was in back, fucking someone.

1:16:45.981 --> 1:16:49.067
Sunday morning

1:16:50.319 --> 1:16:53.739
Brings the dawning

1:16:55.115 --> 1:17:01.496
It's just a restless feeling
By my side

1:17:01.580 --> 1:17:04.082
We'd never been to the West Coast,

1:17:04.166 --> 1:17:08.128
and it was odd the way it struck us
that everybody was very healthy.

1:17:08.837 --> 1:17:12.966
And their idea of a light show
was to have a slide of Buddha on the wall.

1:17:14.551 --> 1:17:17.930
When we came to California,
it was at the Trip and they had a stage.

1:17:18.013 --> 1:17:20.724
What do you put on a stage? Gerard and me.

1:17:20.807 --> 1:17:25.229
We would do this performance
for more people to look at the Velvets.

1:17:26.355 --> 1:17:29.733
There's always someone around you

1:17:29.816 --> 1:17:32.319
Who will call

1:17:33.362 --> 1:17:36.782
It's nothing at all

1:17:38.408 --> 1:17:41.453
And they snuck Frank Zappa on the bill,

1:17:41.537 --> 1:17:44.831
and the Mothers of Invention.
And we despised them.

1:17:44.915 --> 1:17:48.377
And we felt they were everything
the West Coast was.

1:17:49.419 --> 1:17:52.256
They were hippies. We hated hippies.

1:17:52.339 --> 1:17:55.425
I mean, flower power,
you know, burning bras.

1:17:55.509 --> 1:17:57.594
I mean, what the fuck is wrong with you?

1:17:57.678 --> 1:18:00.806
This "love, peace" crap, we hated that.
Get real.

1:18:01.431 --> 1:18:04.476
And free love and,

1:18:04.560 --> 1:18:08.397
"Everybody's wonderful and I love
everybody. Aren't I wonderful?"

1:18:08.480 --> 1:18:13.110
Everybody wants to have a peaceful world
and not get shot in the head or something,

1:18:13.193 --> 1:18:16.363
but you cannot change minds
by handing a flower

1:18:16.446 --> 1:18:18.323
to some bozo who wants to shoot ya.

1:18:19.157 --> 1:18:20.534
They should have been…

1:18:21.827 --> 1:18:24.830
helping homeless people or-- Do something.

1:18:24.913 --> 1:18:29.251
Do something about it. Don't walk around
with your flowers in your hair.

1:18:31.420 --> 1:18:35.883
That was kind of an avoidance
of how important danger was

1:18:35.966 --> 1:18:37.926
and how, you know,
if you're off in that world

1:18:38.010 --> 1:18:40.929
you don't recognize danger
for the value it has.

1:18:42.556 --> 1:18:44.391
The human race was fucked up…

1:18:45.100 --> 1:18:49.438
and they were getting fucked by society.

1:18:49.521 --> 1:18:52.524
So you don't get depressed
and fall over because of it.

1:18:52.608 --> 1:18:55.277
You become strong

1:18:55.360 --> 1:18:58.614
and you become anti a lot of things
that other people aren't anti.

1:18:58.697 --> 1:18:59.990
So you're not--

1:19:00.073 --> 1:19:03.035
And that's sort of an--
the place where the artist comes in

1:19:03.118 --> 1:19:05.871
because he's not with society.

1:19:06.788 --> 1:19:07.915
He's different.

1:19:13.170 --> 1:19:17.424
It's almost impossible to describe
the feeling of being in a rock dance,

1:19:17.508 --> 1:19:21.011
and maybe that's why so many
young people flock here every weekend

1:19:21.094 --> 1:19:24.389
to see what Bill Graham
and Fillmore West is all about.

1:19:24.473 --> 1:19:26.517
People are generally very nice here.
There's a joie.

1:19:26.600 --> 1:19:30.479
There's a certain esprit
which doesn't exist in the other cities,

1:19:30.562 --> 1:19:32.523
which-- New York, Chicago, Detroit,

1:19:32.606 --> 1:19:35.901
where everything is pretty nails-y,
you know, tar.

1:19:35.984 --> 1:19:37.653
Boy, he hated us.

1:19:37.736 --> 1:19:39.947
When we were going onstage,

1:19:40.822 --> 1:19:43.867
he was standing there, and he said,
"I hope you fuckers bomb."

1:19:45.244 --> 1:19:47.996
And well, why did you ask for--
Why did you book us?

1:19:48.080 --> 1:19:51.875
I think he was really jealous
and pissed off

1:19:51.959 --> 1:19:55.295
'cause he has claimed to have
the first multimedia,

1:19:55.379 --> 1:20:00.551
and it was pitiful compared to what
Andy had put together. It really was.

1:20:00.634 --> 1:20:03.554
And we get reviewed.

1:20:03.637 --> 1:20:07.766
"They should be buried,
the Velvet Underground,

1:20:07.850 --> 1:20:09.351
buried underground deep."

1:20:09.434 --> 1:20:12.437
That's what what's-her-name said, Cher.

1:20:12.521 --> 1:20:15.649
And we go back to New York, and we go--
ready to go back to the Dom.

1:20:15.732 --> 1:20:18.694
And, nope, we can't go back
to the Dom. "Why?"

1:20:18.777 --> 1:20:23.073
Well, he sold the lease to Al Grossman,

1:20:23.156 --> 1:20:28.078
who's Dylan's manager, and Dylan
had renamed it the Balloon Farm.

1:20:28.787 --> 1:20:31.582
And we were out.

1:20:33.876 --> 1:20:35.419
Here she comes now

1:20:37.129 --> 1:20:38.881
She's gone, gone, gone

1:20:40.340 --> 1:20:42.259
Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready

1:20:42.342 --> 1:20:44.845
And the second album came around,
and that was when you saw

1:20:44.928 --> 1:20:47.139
the effects of what being on the road did.

1:20:47.222 --> 1:20:50.184
And all the aggro.
And it really told you--

1:20:50.267 --> 1:20:53.228
The aggro reflected everything
that was going on in the band.

1:20:54.104 --> 1:20:56.356
It was getting really
more and more difficult for us

1:20:56.440 --> 1:20:58.775
to operate together.

1:20:59.318 --> 1:21:02.279
-I know that she's long dead and gone
-Heard her call my name

1:21:02.362 --> 1:21:05.532
-Still, it ain't the same
-Heard her call my name

1:21:05.616 --> 1:21:08.911
Oh, when I wake up in this morning
Mama

1:21:08.994 --> 1:21:12.080
-I heard her call my name
-Heard her call my name

1:21:14.416 --> 1:21:18.045
Probably the speediest album
that there was. Really cranked up.

1:21:18.128 --> 1:21:20.005
The engineer left.

1:21:20.088 --> 1:21:23.050
One of the engineers said,
"I don't have to listen to this.

1:21:23.133 --> 1:21:26.762
I'll put it in record and I'm leaving.
When you're done, come and get me."

1:21:37.356 --> 1:21:41.026
-White light
-White light goin', messin' up my mind

1:21:41.109 --> 1:21:42.945
-White light
-And don't you know

1:21:43.028 --> 1:21:45.697
-It's gonna make me go blind
-White heat

1:21:45.781 --> 1:21:48.742
Aw, white heat
It tickle me down to my toes

1:21:48.825 --> 1:21:50.619
-White light
-Oh, have mercy

1:21:50.702 --> 1:21:52.538
While I have it, goodness knows

1:21:52.621 --> 1:21:55.123
All the songs
that were on the second album,

1:21:55.207 --> 1:21:58.126
it was all off the cuff and aggressive.

1:21:58.919 --> 1:22:01.880
I mean, that's
that's straight amphetamine.

1:22:01.964 --> 1:22:04.675
Aw, white heat
It tickle me down to my toes

1:22:05.259 --> 1:22:06.593
Nobody was really talking to each other.

1:22:07.511 --> 1:22:11.348
You know, everybody kept
pushing their faders up.

1:22:11.431 --> 1:22:14.017
And so it got louder
and louder and louder.

1:22:14.101 --> 1:22:18.313
"Well, who's the loudest now?"
You know, it was just child games.

1:22:22.025 --> 1:22:24.611
If we don't improvise,
we're gonna drive each other crazy.

1:22:24.695 --> 1:22:27.531
Well, as it turned out,
we drive each other crazy anyway.

1:22:27.614 --> 1:22:30.826
But improvisation helped on the road

1:22:30.909 --> 1:22:34.621
when you just got off
playing the song over and over and over.

1:22:35.664 --> 1:22:37.791
Cooperation was breaking down.

1:22:38.500 --> 1:22:41.420
White light moved in me
Through my brain

1:22:41.503 --> 1:22:43.630
-White light
-White light goin'

1:22:43.714 --> 1:22:46.175
-Makin' you go insane
-White heat

1:22:46.258 --> 1:22:49.761
Aw, white heat
It tickles me down to my toes

1:22:49.845 --> 1:22:52.723
White light, I said now
Goodness knows

1:22:52.806 --> 1:22:57.019
We never intended that now
it's the Velvet Underground and Nico.

1:22:57.102 --> 1:23:00.480
That-- It was just a-- That was
in our minds a temporary thing.

1:23:15.996 --> 1:23:18.999
Here's Room 546

1:23:20.125 --> 1:23:23.337
It's enough to make you sick

1:23:24.671 --> 1:23:27.966
Brigid's all wrapped up in foil

1:23:28.050 --> 1:23:30.928
You wonder if

1:23:32.304 --> 1:23:35.682
Nico did everything
that we asked her to do in the band,

1:23:36.308 --> 1:23:39.144
and-- But I think
that in her heart of hearts

1:23:39.228 --> 1:23:41.605
there was something else
that was really pulling her.

1:23:44.483 --> 1:23:47.736
She would always be sitting down
writing lyrics, writing poetry.

1:23:49.112 --> 1:23:54.201
There was always something
drawing her away from collective work.

1:23:57.829 --> 1:23:59.289
She was a wanderer.

1:23:59.373 --> 1:24:04.670
She wandered into the situation,
and then she just quietly wandered off.

1:24:07.256 --> 1:24:10.801
Magic marker row

1:24:10.884 --> 1:24:13.887
You wonder just

1:24:15.514 --> 1:24:19.059
How high they go

1:24:20.686 --> 1:24:22.771
Here they come now

1:24:22.855 --> 1:24:25.732
And then it-- After all of that,

1:24:25.816 --> 1:24:28.819
Lou suddenly went crazy.

1:24:31.196 --> 1:24:34.241
And then fired Andy and…

1:24:35.075 --> 1:24:36.535
and Andy called him a rat.

1:24:51.967 --> 1:24:54.887
The whole thing was done
behind closed doors.

1:24:54.970 --> 1:24:56.930
I mean, I had no idea
that Lou had fired Andy.

1:24:58.765 --> 1:25:01.560
People thought Andy Warhol
was the lead guitarist,

1:25:01.643 --> 1:25:07.441
and that made life a little difficult when
we left the-- our great shepherd.

1:25:41.892 --> 1:25:43.310
So this is called "Sister Ray."

1:25:45.938 --> 1:25:47.523
It's about some queens.

1:25:49.399 --> 1:25:51.527
And one's called Duck
and the other's called Sally.

1:26:01.161 --> 1:26:04.206
Duck and Sally inside

1:26:05.457 --> 1:26:08.126
Searching for the down pipe

1:26:09.294 --> 1:26:12.130
Who're staring at Miss Rayon

1:26:13.674 --> 1:26:16.051
Who's licking up her pig pen

1:26:17.886 --> 1:26:20.430
I'm searching for my mainline

1:26:22.224 --> 1:26:24.601
I couldn't hit it sideways

1:26:24.685 --> 1:26:28.397
Harvard professors,
fashion models from New York,

1:26:29.064 --> 1:26:31.233
honest-to-God juvenile delinquents,

1:26:31.316 --> 1:26:32.818
you know, bike gangs…

1:26:34.903 --> 1:26:36.822
nerds like myself.

1:26:39.533 --> 1:26:42.578
Grateful Dead fans. A lot of people
were fans of both bands.

1:26:50.669 --> 1:26:53.589
We started realizing
that we were getting a following.

1:26:53.672 --> 1:26:56.842
And of course that was nice,

1:26:56.925 --> 1:27:00.470
especially in Boston,
because we played there so often.

1:27:01.722 --> 1:27:04.516
I saw them
a total of about 60 or 70 times.

1:27:05.601 --> 1:27:09.313
The reason I felt emotionally free
hearing it is I was hearing this music

1:27:09.396 --> 1:27:11.607
that I realized sounded like nothing else.

1:27:11.690 --> 1:27:14.318
They'd get into a certain sound
and then never again.

1:27:14.401 --> 1:27:15.819
That was what was exciting.

1:27:15.903 --> 1:27:17.905
Oh, do it, yeah, just like

1:27:18.530 --> 1:27:20.532
Yeah, just like Sister Ray said

1:27:21.366 --> 1:27:24.912
So not only was it new,
but it was radically different.

1:27:25.704 --> 1:27:30.751
It was this slow, mid-tempo or slow tempo
stuff that wasn't rock and roll.

1:27:30.834 --> 1:27:33.754
It was this strange, strange melodies.

1:27:35.797 --> 1:27:37.299
You could watch them play

1:27:38.258 --> 1:27:40.469
and there would be overtones
that you couldn't account for.

1:27:40.552 --> 1:27:41.970
You could see with, you know--

1:27:43.931 --> 1:27:46.141
Then you'd hear a lead--
a fuzz lead over that.

1:27:47.267 --> 1:27:49.019
Something-- And you'd hear the bassline.

1:27:51.772 --> 1:27:54.233
But there'd be
these other sounds in the room,

1:27:54.316 --> 1:27:56.527
and you could look at everyone
and you were just--

1:27:56.610 --> 1:27:58.570
Where is it coming from?

1:27:58.654 --> 1:28:01.031
It was this group sound.

1:28:13.418 --> 1:28:16.922
Typical would be a long version
of "Sister Ray"

1:28:17.005 --> 1:28:19.216
and the five seconds afterwards.

1:28:20.509 --> 1:28:24.221
The five seconds afterwards tells you
a lot about what it was like to see them.

1:28:24.304 --> 1:28:26.098
So all of a sudden, you know,
they'd be going--

1:28:28.308 --> 1:28:30.519
Then all the different keyboard parts.

1:28:33.689 --> 1:28:36.441
Then there was that--
all these different things. The drums.

1:28:36.525 --> 1:28:37.609
And all of a sudden--

1:28:39.152 --> 1:28:41.655
And it would stop like that,
and the audience

1:28:41.738 --> 1:28:45.409
would be dead silent for one…

1:28:49.538 --> 1:28:53.125
Five, and then they'd applaud.

1:28:54.376 --> 1:28:58.297
They, the Velvet Underground,
had hypnotized them one more time.

1:29:01.175 --> 1:29:03.802
Here I am at the Boston Tea Party,

1:29:03.886 --> 1:29:05.637
and the Velvet Underground
has got their amps.

1:29:05.721 --> 1:29:08.891
They are already starting to set up.
I just watched them tune up.

1:29:09.474 --> 1:29:10.809
I would ask questions.

1:29:10.893 --> 1:29:14.438
I'd say, "How come you use just
the fuzz tone on that passage? Why?"

1:29:14.521 --> 1:29:15.814
And like, "And that sound?"

1:29:15.898 --> 1:29:19.568
And he'd say, "That sound,
young man, is many things."

1:29:21.236 --> 1:29:25.240
And Sterling Morrison was the one
who taught me how to play guitar.

1:29:25.324 --> 1:29:28.869
The freedom of it made me feel
less tied to high school,

1:29:28.952 --> 1:29:32.122
less tied to any conventions
that other music had

1:29:32.206 --> 1:29:34.750
and helped me figure out
how to make my own music.

1:29:35.375 --> 1:29:38.462
This is what they were like.
They were generous.

1:29:38.545 --> 1:29:42.925
They were certainly generous with me.
They let me open a show for them once.

1:29:43.008 --> 1:29:46.470
And so when there was tensions
between people in the band,

1:29:47.221 --> 1:29:49.181
I was allowed to hang around.

1:29:49.264 --> 1:29:51.183
They knew I wasn't gonna say anything.

1:29:52.017 --> 1:29:55.103
But, yeah, you could feel some tension.

1:29:55.187 --> 1:29:58.607
But I was very shocked
when it was so extreme

1:29:58.690 --> 1:30:02.027
that John Cale wasn't in the band anymore.

1:30:08.367 --> 1:30:11.203
There were often sparks,
you know, the three guys.

1:30:11.286 --> 1:30:16.333
In fact, you know, I could hardly go
to a rehearsal, it was just so stressful.

1:30:16.416 --> 1:30:19.628
They might have been arguing
about the music itself.

1:30:19.711 --> 1:30:22.798
Or Lou could just be being peevish,

1:30:22.881 --> 1:30:26.885
or maybe too much in charge,
telling other people what to do.

1:30:28.053 --> 1:30:29.596
That was just always there.

1:30:29.680 --> 1:30:32.724
Lou going for it, being on top.

1:30:39.898 --> 1:30:41.900
I really didn't know how to please him.

1:30:42.651 --> 1:30:46.321
I mean, there was nothing
that I could do that--

1:30:46.947 --> 1:30:50.534
You'd try and be nice,
he'd hate you more. He was…

1:30:53.203 --> 1:30:56.748
And trying to suggest something,
he'd just dismiss it.

1:30:57.833 --> 1:30:59.459
He's a tortured person.

1:31:00.919 --> 1:31:04.173
Although I have to say, John Cale,
he could really go off.

1:31:04.256 --> 1:31:07.634
He just makes it so unpleasant
to be near him

1:31:08.635 --> 1:31:10.137
if he doesn't feel good.

1:31:10.220 --> 1:31:11.346
And he was dark.

1:31:14.057 --> 1:31:17.561
The thing that we understood
where we were, where everything else was,

1:31:17.644 --> 1:31:20.147
and how much disdain we had
for everything else.

1:31:20.856 --> 1:31:24.067
You know, in the end, unfortunately,

1:31:24.151 --> 1:31:27.154
it became each of us.

1:31:27.905 --> 1:31:31.158
I think there came a point
when you just said, "Hell with it.

1:31:31.241 --> 1:31:34.995
We're not solving our problems here
by acting like this.

1:31:35.078 --> 1:31:39.041
And nobody's out there
to help us to straighten it out."

1:31:39.124 --> 1:31:42.836
And we'd never let anybody tell us
what to do.

1:31:44.379 --> 1:31:48.926
If all those drugs hadn't been around, we
would have all been pushing for something.

1:31:49.801 --> 1:31:52.679
That it was the time
to really back off for a minute…

1:31:54.056 --> 1:31:55.557
because the trust was gone.

1:31:57.100 --> 1:31:59.061
Maybe Lou got jealous.

1:31:59.144 --> 1:32:01.188
I would attribute it
to something like that.

1:32:03.065 --> 1:32:07.986
Lou made an ultimatum
that either he or John would have to go.

1:32:08.070 --> 1:32:11.698
He called Sterling and I, and we met him
at a coffee shop or something,

1:32:11.782 --> 1:32:13.283
and he told us this.

1:32:13.367 --> 1:32:15.285
You know, he just couldn't work
with John anymore,

1:32:15.369 --> 1:32:18.664
and we could either
stay with him or go with John.

1:32:20.249 --> 1:32:24.795
I got a visit from Sterling,
and he said, "I've just come from Lou."

1:32:24.878 --> 1:32:26.922
And I said, "Yeah,
we gotta start rehearsing.

1:32:27.005 --> 1:32:28.632
We're going to Cleveland on--
on the weekend."

1:32:28.715 --> 1:32:32.094
He said, "Well, no."
He said, "We are, yes. You're not."

1:32:32.970 --> 1:32:34.221
And I said, "What are you talking about?"

1:32:34.304 --> 1:32:38.058
He said, "Well, Lou's sent me over here
to tell you that

1:32:38.141 --> 1:32:41.228
he told the rest of us that if John goes,
I don't go."

1:32:41.979 --> 1:32:43.021
And that was it.

1:32:43.647 --> 1:32:45.649
And there was that moment again,

1:32:45.732 --> 1:32:49.528
that flash of wondering
what the hell's gonna happen next.

1:32:52.322 --> 1:32:55.450
I thought,
"Well, I better get on to production."

1:33:00.247 --> 1:33:03.834
It was really devastating to me,
because by this point,

1:33:03.917 --> 1:33:06.670
this band helped me understand life.

1:33:06.753 --> 1:33:10.883
Like, the sounds they were making
helped me build a dreamscape.

1:33:10.966 --> 1:33:13.177
Their tone colors-- this was--

1:33:14.386 --> 1:33:17.556
I mean, to me this was being-- like
being in the presence of Michelangelo.

1:33:22.102 --> 1:33:26.982
Lou really, really wanted
to get some success going.

1:33:27.065 --> 1:33:28.650
You know, real success.

1:33:29.401 --> 1:33:35.073
Maybe he wanted to make it less
avant-garde, or whatever the word is.

1:33:37.492 --> 1:33:38.994
You know, more normal.

1:33:41.038 --> 1:33:42.623
Here we go. Rolling on one.

1:34:06.188 --> 1:34:08.357
She's over by the corner

1:34:08.440 --> 1:34:11.109
Doug Yule came in from what I remember,

1:34:11.193 --> 1:34:13.487
gallantly learning many songs
very quickly.

1:34:14.112 --> 1:34:18.909
And he in himself
was a very exacting and serious musician.

1:34:19.535 --> 1:34:23.121
And with his own harmonic sense,
which brought something different.

1:34:25.332 --> 1:34:27.125
I think the difference was profound.

1:34:27.876 --> 1:34:29.545
I think we were still a good band,

1:34:29.628 --> 1:34:33.507
and Doug had his own things
to bring to the band,

1:34:33.590 --> 1:34:35.884
but no one could replace Cale.

1:34:35.968 --> 1:34:38.554
Don't you know something?
She sent 'em right back

1:34:38.637 --> 1:34:40.097
All right

1:34:42.891 --> 1:34:44.685
Good evening.

1:34:44.768 --> 1:34:46.979
We're your local Velvet Underground,

1:34:47.062 --> 1:34:49.690
and I'm glad to see you.

1:34:52.442 --> 1:34:53.777
Thank you.

1:34:53.861 --> 1:34:57.698
And we're particularly glad
that people could find a little time

1:34:57.781 --> 1:35:00.450
to come out and just have some fun
to some rock and roll.

1:35:04.079 --> 1:35:05.497
They were playing really quiet.

1:35:05.581 --> 1:35:07.416
They'd started playing much quieter
at this point.

1:35:14.590 --> 1:35:17.342
Sometimes I feel so happy

1:35:20.345 --> 1:35:22.931
Sometimes I feel so sad

1:35:26.059 --> 1:35:28.645
Sometimes I feel so happy

1:35:30.105 --> 1:35:33.984
But mostly you just make me mad

1:35:36.361 --> 1:35:39.781
Baby, you just make me mad

1:35:43.827 --> 1:35:48.832
Linger on

1:35:48.916 --> 1:35:52.002
Your pale blue eyes

1:35:55.464 --> 1:36:00.469
Linger on

1:36:00.552 --> 1:36:03.805
Your pale blue eyes

1:36:03.889 --> 1:36:07.184
There was a certain theory
behind it, and that was of space.

1:36:07.267 --> 1:36:08.977
Like, all the songs were very spacey.

1:36:09.061 --> 1:36:12.356
Like, you know, we didn't put things in,
we took things out,

1:36:12.439 --> 1:36:15.108
which is kind of the reverse
of the way everybody else works.

1:36:15.192 --> 1:36:19.363
Like, you know, we never add instruments,
we don't bring people in for sessions.

1:36:19.446 --> 1:36:24.284
We don't-- We don't basically do anything
that we can't reproduce onstage.

1:36:35.504 --> 1:36:40.801
The third album, the gray album,
we were playing in LA,

1:36:40.884 --> 1:36:44.429
and Steve said, you know,
"There's a change of plans.

1:36:44.513 --> 1:36:47.057
We're gonna stay over an extra week
and do an album."

1:36:48.100 --> 1:36:51.395
Candy says

1:36:53.605 --> 1:36:57.693
"I've come to hate my body

1:36:59.570 --> 1:37:03.448
And all that it requires…

1:37:03.532 --> 1:37:05.826
"Candy Says" has its own kind of tension.

1:37:05.909 --> 1:37:09.079
You know, it's about somebody saying,
"I've come to hate my body

1:37:09.162 --> 1:37:11.039
and all it requires in this world."

1:37:11.123 --> 1:37:13.542
And with all that little pretty music
going on, you know,

1:37:13.625 --> 1:37:15.878
and you start figuring, you know,
"What is that all about?"

1:37:15.961 --> 1:37:19.006
And then the whole rest of
the third album is just about that.

1:37:19.715 --> 1:37:22.384
Over my shoulder

1:37:22.467 --> 1:37:24.803
What do you think I'd see

1:37:24.887 --> 1:37:28.432
I didn't know I was going to sing
that song until we were doing the vocals,

1:37:28.515 --> 1:37:31.143
and he sang one, and he came back in
and said, "Why don't you sing one?

1:37:31.226 --> 1:37:35.063
You know, it's fun to not always sing.
It's fun to kick back and, you know,

1:37:35.147 --> 1:37:37.524
play the guitar and just not have
to be the lead voice."

1:37:38.108 --> 1:37:41.236
This is a song that
I originally had figured on

1:37:41.320 --> 1:37:45.240
featuring myself doing it with a,
you know, spotlight and a gold lamé dress.

1:37:45.324 --> 1:37:47.743
But then I figured,
"Well, you know, I don't--

1:37:47.826 --> 1:37:49.244
I don't know if they're ready
to accept that."

1:37:49.870 --> 1:37:51.872
So, we got old Maureen out

1:37:51.955 --> 1:37:54.625
and we figured they'll believe her
where they wouldn't believe me.

1:37:54.708 --> 1:37:56.668
This'll be our last song for this set.

1:37:56.752 --> 1:37:58.462
It's called "After Hours."

1:37:58.545 --> 1:38:01.757
If you close the door

1:38:03.008 --> 1:38:06.637
The night could last forever

1:38:06.720 --> 1:38:10.098
Leave the sunshine out

1:38:11.183 --> 1:38:13.727
And say hello to never

1:38:13.810 --> 1:38:15.812
I was scared to death.

1:38:15.896 --> 1:38:21.610
I'd never sang anything, and I was
really like, "I can't do this, and--"

1:38:21.693 --> 1:38:24.363
In fact,
we had to send Sterling out of the room

1:38:24.446 --> 1:38:26.490
because he was laughing at me.

1:38:28.283 --> 1:38:30.577
I'd never have to see the day again

1:38:30.661 --> 1:38:35.290
I told Lou, "I don't wanna sing it live
unless someone requests it,"

1:38:35.374 --> 1:38:38.126
'cause I was hoping
no one would ever request it.

1:38:38.919 --> 1:38:42.381
And, like, two shows later,
we were in Texas

1:38:42.464 --> 1:38:44.758
and someone requested it,
and I got through it, so…

1:38:44.842 --> 1:38:47.010
And drink a toast to never

1:38:47.094 --> 1:38:50.639
When they did play the Boston Tea Party,
and Maureen would come out and sing,

1:38:50.722 --> 1:38:54.017
people who weren't even fans
of the band much that night,

1:38:54.101 --> 1:38:56.854
juvenile delinquents who just said,
"Who are these guys?

1:38:56.937 --> 1:39:00.023
There's no Jimmy Page guitar solo here,
what is this crap?"

1:39:00.107 --> 1:39:03.569
All of a sudden, when, you know,
Maureen Tucker would come out,

1:39:03.652 --> 1:39:08.198
you know, and would just come out,
just go, "If you close the door,"

1:39:08.282 --> 1:39:11.493
and everybody-- she'd get everybody.

1:39:12.494 --> 1:39:13.537
Thank you.

1:39:28.093 --> 1:39:30.762
Jenny said
When she was just five years old

1:39:30.846 --> 1:39:33.682
There was nothing happening at all

1:39:37.227 --> 1:39:39.897
Every time she puts on the radio

1:39:39.980 --> 1:39:43.275
There was nothing going down at all

1:39:43.358 --> 1:39:44.776
Not at all

1:39:46.361 --> 1:39:49.114
Then one fine morning she puts on
A New York station

1:39:49.198 --> 1:39:51.867
You know, she don't believe
What she heard at all

1:39:55.204 --> 1:39:57.789
She started shaking
To that fine, fine music

1:39:57.873 --> 1:40:01.460
You know her life was saved
By rock and roll

1:40:03.337 --> 1:40:06.507
Despite all the amputation

1:40:06.590 --> 1:40:10.385
You know you could just go out
And dance to the rock and roll station

1:40:10.469 --> 1:40:13.555
-And it was all right
-It was all right

1:40:13.639 --> 1:40:17.935
-Hey, baby, you know it was all right
-It was all right

1:40:32.783 --> 1:40:35.994
Like Jenny said
When she was just about five years old

1:40:36.078 --> 1:40:39.498
Hey, you know
There's nothing happening at all

1:40:39.581 --> 1:40:43.627
Any one thing I could do over again
would be to refuse to do Loaded

1:40:43.710 --> 1:40:45.546
until Maureen was, you know, able to play.

1:40:46.797 --> 1:40:51.260
Loaded was recorded in April,
I believe, of '70.

1:40:51.343 --> 1:40:54.304
And I was pregnant and too fat
to reach the drums,

1:40:54.388 --> 1:40:55.722
so I couldn't play.

1:40:56.849 --> 1:40:59.268
I was disappointed, 'cause there was
a number of songs on there

1:40:59.351 --> 1:41:02.020
that I think really required me.

1:41:02.104 --> 1:41:03.522
It was a big difference.

1:41:07.234 --> 1:41:09.820
You know, Maureen wasn't in it,
Sterling was--

1:41:09.903 --> 1:41:13.323
he stopped coming after a while.
I play a lot of guitar on Loaded.

1:41:13.407 --> 1:41:15.117
You know, it must have been
very frustrating for him

1:41:15.200 --> 1:41:17.411
to just sit in the control room for hours,
you know,

1:41:17.494 --> 1:41:21.081
while some little part was,
you know, thrashed out.

1:41:21.790 --> 1:41:25.794
I knew that they were making records,
I knew that-- I never met Doug.

1:41:26.503 --> 1:41:28.046
I don't--

1:41:28.130 --> 1:41:31.842
But whatever it was,
it wasn't my business anymore.

1:41:32.342 --> 1:41:34.094
And Lou made it clear
it wasn't my business.

1:41:35.971 --> 1:41:39.016
They were unique in the very beginning.

1:41:39.099 --> 1:41:43.312
Every member was an equal contributor
in their own right, you know.

1:41:43.395 --> 1:41:45.564
But now they were like
a regular rock and roll band,

1:41:45.647 --> 1:41:49.651
and they had a brilliant,
creative person totally in charge.

1:41:49.735 --> 1:41:52.321
And Lou had tons of pop songs.

1:41:53.447 --> 1:41:57.159
And Lou started to find his own voice.

1:41:59.286 --> 1:42:03.290
Pop dissolved high culture.
That's what Lou brought in.

1:42:03.373 --> 1:42:05.709
That came bubbling out of Long Island.

1:42:05.792 --> 1:42:09.838
Melting the crystalline structure,
which was just what we had had in mind.

1:42:13.175 --> 1:42:15.636
Standing on the corner

1:42:17.846 --> 1:42:20.474
Suitcase in my hand

1:42:21.266 --> 1:42:24.686
Jack is in his corset
Jane is in her vest

1:42:26.271 --> 1:42:28.607
And me, I'm in a rock and roll band

1:42:32.069 --> 1:42:34.446
Riding in a Stutz Bear Cat, Jim

1:42:35.572 --> 1:42:38.867
You know, those were different times

1:42:40.661 --> 1:42:43.497
Oh, all the poets
They studied rules of verse

1:42:43.580 --> 1:42:46.959
And those ladies
They rolled their eyes

1:42:50.170 --> 1:42:54.174
Sweet Jane

1:42:54.967 --> 1:42:59.179
Sweet Jane

1:42:59.263 --> 1:43:02.641
Sweet Jane

1:43:02.724 --> 1:43:05.853
I just think it's fantastic that
we can play this stuff in public.

1:43:05.936 --> 1:43:08.814
I mean, you know, it really turns me on
that it turns them on.

1:43:08.897 --> 1:43:11.191
And Jane, she is a clerk

1:43:11.275 --> 1:43:13.861
We don't have any point to prove
or any ax to grind,

1:43:13.944 --> 1:43:17.114
or just anything to tell anybody else.

1:43:17.197 --> 1:43:20.033
And when
When they come home from work

1:43:22.578 --> 1:43:24.371
He knew he was talented.

1:43:24.454 --> 1:43:29.084
He knew he was a great
guitar player and a great songwriter.

1:43:30.043 --> 1:43:34.506
And we weren't getting anywhere
as far as what he hoped to achieve.

1:43:35.757 --> 1:43:38.677
And, damn it… when is this gonna happen?

1:43:39.887 --> 1:43:43.182
But anyone who ever had a heart

1:43:43.807 --> 1:43:48.187
Oh, they wouldn't turn around
And break it

1:43:49.062 --> 1:43:52.399
And anyone who ever played a part

1:43:52.482 --> 1:43:56.778
Oh, they wouldn't turn around
And hate it

1:43:58.488 --> 1:44:02.409
Sweet Jane

1:44:03.035 --> 1:44:06.163
Sweet Jane

1:44:12.794 --> 1:44:14.922
Then came the show at Max's.

1:44:17.508 --> 1:44:18.926
He just ground to a halt.

1:44:21.678 --> 1:44:24.223
Here comes the ocean

1:44:24.890 --> 1:44:30.229
And the waves down by the sea

1:44:30.312 --> 1:44:32.523
To think that this is after five years,

1:44:32.606 --> 1:44:39.112
they're playing upstairs at Max's
with a way shrunken band.

1:44:39.196 --> 1:44:43.325
And the waves, where have they been?

1:44:47.955 --> 1:44:51.208
He was growling,
just barely getting through it.

1:44:51.291 --> 1:44:53.210
Really not having any fun.

1:44:53.293 --> 1:44:57.840
It could just drive me crazy

1:44:57.923 --> 1:44:59.842
I'd kind of decided to go back to school.

1:44:59.925 --> 1:45:03.929
Get away from all of that sort of thing.

1:45:05.681 --> 1:45:07.391
He just didn't wanna tell us, I think.

1:45:07.474 --> 1:45:11.562
He didn't run away, but when he told
us was as we walked in the airport.

1:45:11.645 --> 1:45:13.856
He finally said, "I'm not going."

1:45:16.525 --> 1:45:19.111
And he did tell me the reason he did that

1:45:19.194 --> 1:45:21.154
was he was afraid
they'd talk him out of it.

1:45:21.947 --> 1:45:24.032
Moe would cry. No.

1:45:25.576 --> 1:45:28.912
Moe said it was like being
stabbed in the heart by him.

1:45:29.496 --> 1:45:32.416
…of the land

1:45:32.499 --> 1:45:38.172
That has been down by the sea

1:45:40.674 --> 1:45:45.554
I had gone to see them at Max's,
and the set was over,

1:45:45.637 --> 1:45:49.016
and Lou came and walked
towards the exit.

1:45:49.099 --> 1:45:51.518
I said, "Oh, Lou."
He just kept walking really fast.

1:45:53.395 --> 1:45:56.607
And then someone said,
"He just quit the band."

1:45:56.690 --> 1:45:59.359
Down by the sea

1:46:00.611 --> 1:46:03.864
He just quit. That's it.
That's-- he-- it's over.

1:46:06.241 --> 1:46:12.706
Here comes the ocean and the waves

1:46:12.789 --> 1:46:15.751
Down by the shore

1:46:19.588 --> 1:46:23.300
Here comes the ocean

1:46:23.383 --> 1:46:26.053
And the waves…

1:46:26.136 --> 1:46:29.348
After he left the band, he went
and stayed at his parents' house

1:46:29.431 --> 1:46:31.058
for a year and a half or something.

1:46:31.808 --> 1:46:35.938
He was trying to get it together,
I guess, his brains.

1:46:36.522 --> 1:46:39.525
There'd been, like, a real
problem with management.

1:46:39.608 --> 1:46:41.527
I went off to lick my wounds.

1:46:41.610 --> 1:46:43.779
My mother had told me
when I was in school, she said,

1:46:43.862 --> 1:46:47.491
"You should take typing so you have
a profession to fall back on."

1:46:47.574 --> 1:46:52.496
I am a lazy son
I never get things done

1:46:52.579 --> 1:46:57.209
Made up mostly of water

1:46:57.292 --> 1:46:59.878
And here

1:46:59.962 --> 1:47:03.006
Come the waves

1:47:06.260 --> 1:47:09.137
Down by the shore

1:47:09.221 --> 1:47:11.807
They had shined so brightly

1:47:11.890 --> 1:47:16.979
that no space could contain
that amount of light being put out.

1:47:25.112 --> 1:47:28.991
You need physics
to describe that band at its height.

1:47:29.074 --> 1:47:32.077
Here come the waves

1:47:35.163 --> 1:47:39.501
It had entropy within it.

1:47:40.586 --> 1:47:44.590
Here come the waves

1:47:53.765 --> 1:47:57.311
Here come the waves

1:48:29.426 --> 1:48:35.474
Here come the waves

1:48:39.937 --> 1:48:45.943
Here come the waves

1:48:50.239 --> 1:48:55.202
Here come the waves

1:49:03.418 --> 1:49:05.671
Hello? Yeah.

1:49:06.213 --> 1:49:07.297
It's Barbara.

1:49:10.092 --> 1:49:12.010
Hey, is anything happening?

1:49:12.928 --> 1:49:14.054
Great.

1:49:14.805 --> 1:49:18.100
Don't be silly.
Just get something over here quick.

1:49:20.143 --> 1:49:21.270
I'll talk to you later.

1:49:25.023 --> 1:49:26.692
Do you like the way the colors go in that?

1:49:26.775 --> 1:49:28.193
They're very strange.

1:49:28.277 --> 1:49:30.195
They're photo-- photographs or…

1:49:30.279 --> 1:49:32.447
-No, they're paintings.
-They look nice.

1:49:32.531 --> 1:49:34.700
But there's one
of the Velvet Underground in there.

1:49:34.783 --> 1:49:36.660
Isn't that amazing?

1:49:36.743 --> 1:49:38.370
That is amazing.

1:49:39.663 --> 1:49:40.956
Who's this one person?

1:49:41.039 --> 1:49:42.249
-That's Sterling.
-Sterling.

1:49:43.333 --> 1:49:45.794
I missed that one.

1:49:45.878 --> 1:49:47.004
Do you still see any of them?

1:49:47.087 --> 1:49:50.966
Yeah, I saw Maureen last week.

1:49:51.550 --> 1:49:53.552
Yeah, she's a computer programmer now.

1:49:53.635 --> 1:49:55.470
-Yeah. She works in a factory.
-What do--

1:49:55.554 --> 1:49:56.847
-In more than one sense.
-Really?

1:49:58.599 --> 1:50:00.809
IBM. She's got a kid.

1:50:00.893 --> 1:50:03.520
You still in contact with John? John Cale?

1:50:04.146 --> 1:50:06.064
Yeah, I heard from him the other day.

1:50:06.565 --> 1:50:09.443
What is he--
He's still writing, of course, but…

1:50:09.526 --> 1:50:12.029
He's working for Island Records and…

1:50:12.905 --> 1:50:14.865
He's with Island? I didn't realize--

1:50:14.948 --> 1:50:17.201
He was with Warner Brothers,
now he's with Island.

1:50:27.878 --> 1:50:29.713
It took us a while to get here.

1:50:33.217 --> 1:50:37.137
I don't know

1:50:37.721 --> 1:50:40.140
Just where I'm going

1:50:43.685 --> 1:50:47.689
But I'm going to try

1:50:47.773 --> 1:50:49.900
For the kingdom if I can

1:50:50.901 --> 1:50:55.405
'Cause it makes me feel like I'm a man

1:50:56.156 --> 1:51:00.202
When I put a spike into my vein

1:51:00.869 --> 1:51:04.915
Oh, I tell you
Things aren't quite the same

1:51:05.874 --> 1:51:09.419
When I'm rushing on my run

1:51:10.462 --> 1:51:13.799
And I feel just like Jesus' son

1:51:14.842 --> 1:51:18.053
And I guess I just don't know

1:51:18.929 --> 1:51:21.890
And I guess that I just don't know

1:51:32.609 --> 1:51:34.319
I

1:51:37.197 --> 1:51:38.907
Don't know

1:51:41.159 --> 1:51:44.329
I've decided a couple of things

1:51:52.963 --> 1:51:54.923
But I

1:51:57.718 --> 1:51:59.720
Know that I'm

1:52:01.346 --> 1:52:04.558
Gonna try and negate my life

1:52:04.641 --> 1:52:08.812
'Cause when the blood begins to flow

1:52:09.771 --> 1:52:12.983
When it shoots up the dropper's neck

1:52:13.775 --> 1:52:16.862
When I'm closing in on death

1:52:28.874 --> 1:52:30.876
You can't help me

1:52:30.959 --> 1:52:33.962
Not you guys
Or all you sweet pretty girls

1:52:34.046 --> 1:52:36.131
With all your sweet pretty talk

1:52:36.757 --> 1:52:39.927
You can all go take a walk

1:52:40.677 --> 1:52:43.722
And I guess I just don't know

1:52:44.598 --> 1:52:47.518
And I guess that I just don't know

1:52:58.070 --> 1:53:04.493
I wish that

1:53:06.286 --> 1:53:09.164
I was born a thousand years ago

1:53:18.757 --> 1:53:24.513
And I wish that

1:53:27.099 --> 1:53:30.394
I'd sailed the darkened seas

1:53:31.478 --> 1:53:35.107
On a great, big clipper ship

1:53:36.316 --> 1:53:40.445
Goin' from this land here to that

1:53:41.280 --> 1:53:45.117
Put on a sailor's suit and cap

1:54:03.594 --> 1:54:07.806
Away from the big cities

1:54:07.890 --> 1:54:11.018
Where a man cannot be free

1:54:11.101 --> 1:54:14.730
Of all of the evil in this town

1:54:14.813 --> 1:54:18.400
And of himself and those around

1:54:18.483 --> 1:54:22.029
Oh, and I guess I just don't know

1:54:22.112 --> 1:54:26.116
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know

1:55:05.948 --> 1:55:12.663
And what costume
Shall the poor girl wear

1:55:15.457 --> 1:55:20.546
To all tomorrow's parties?

1:55:23.257 --> 1:55:29.555
A hand-me-down dress
From who-knows-where

1:55:32.432 --> 1:55:37.563
To all tomorrow's parties

1:55:40.232 --> 1:55:45.362
And where will she go
And what shall she do

1:55:45.445 --> 1:55:49.700
When midnight comes around?

1:55:53.078 --> 1:55:59.293
She'll turn once more
To Sunday's clown

1:56:02.254 --> 1:56:06.925
And cry behind the door

1:56:47.883 --> 1:56:54.389
And what costume shall
The poor girl wear

1:56:57.476 --> 1:57:02.356
To all tomorrow's parties?

1:57:05.025 --> 1:57:11.240
Why silks and linens
Of yesterday's gowns

1:57:14.284 --> 1:57:19.289
To all tomorrow's parties?

1:57:21.875 --> 1:57:27.089
And what will she do
With Thursday's rags

1:57:27.172 --> 1:57:31.301
When Monday comes around?

1:57:34.763 --> 1:57:40.894
She'll turn once more
To Sunday's clown

1:57:43.814 --> 1:57:48.569
And cry behind the door

1:58:47.085 --> 1:58:53.509
And what costume shall
The poor girl wear

1:58:56.470 --> 1:59:01.642
To all tomorrow's parties?

1:59:04.019 --> 1:59:10.067
For Thursday's child is Sunday's clown

1:59:12.903 --> 1:59:17.950
For whom none will go mourning

1:59:20.577 --> 1:59:25.499
A blackened shroud
A hand-me-down gown

1:59:25.582 --> 1:59:30.462
Of rags and silks, a costume

1:59:33.382 --> 1:59:40.389
Fit for one who sits and cries

1:59:42.015 --> 1:59:47.396
For all tomorrow's parties
