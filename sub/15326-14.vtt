08:50.905 --> 08:54.283
AND IT GOES UP AND DOWN.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.577
- ACTUALLY,
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.

08:56.661 --> 08:59.413
- VAGUE,
BUT I'M LISTENING.

09:02.959 --> 09:04.752
A NICKEL?

09:04.835 --> 09:06.921
- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN BUY
IF YOU SAVE TEN OF THOSE?

09:07.004 --> 09:12.301
- HOPEFULLY A CLUE TO WHERE
YOU'RE GOING WITH THIS.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.511
- HEY, NOW,
WHEN I WAS A BOY,

09:13.594 --> 09:14.387
IF I WANTED SOMETHING,
I HAD TO WORK FOR IT.

09:14.470 --> 09:17.598
- YOU DON'T THINK THIS IS WORK?

09:22.603 --> 09:24.230
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND
THE APPEAL OF REAL TREES.

09:24.313 --> 09:26.732
THEY SHED AND CATCH FIRE.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.943
AND YOU ONLY HAVE TO BUY
A FAKE TREE ONCE.

09:29.026 --> 09:32.071
- I HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT
FOR YEARS.

09:32.154 --> 09:35.157
AND I'M NEVER SAYING IT AGAIN.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.575
FRANKLIN, WHAT DO YOU DO
FOR A LIVING?

09:36.659 --> 09:37.827
- I'M A BEAN COUNTER.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.036
- AH, NUMBERS GUY.

09:39.120 --> 09:43.374
- NOPE, QUALITY CONTROL
AT VAN LEAR BEAN COMPANY.

09:43.457 --> 09:44.000
278 IN EVERY CAN.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.459
[both laugh]

09:45.543 --> 09:47.753
BUT I'M RETIRING NEXT YEAR.

09:47.837 --> 09:48.587
- RETIRING?
AT OUR AGE?

09:48.671 --> 09:51.465
YOUR--YOUR--
YOUR AGE?

09:53.092 --> 09:55.678
I'M GONNA GO WRANGLE
MY REALLY YOUNG KIDS.

09:55.761 --> 09:58.347
THEN I'M GONNA MAYBE
RUN A FEW LAPS

09:58.431 --> 10:01.017
AND THEN MAYBE
HAVE SOME MORE KIDS,

10:01.100 --> 10:02.226
BECAUSE I CAN STILL DO THAT.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.024
- YOUR DAD SAYS
THAT FAKE TREES ARE BETTER.

10:08.107 --> 10:10.484
- MOM, THESE ARE YOUR TRADITIONS
WE'VE ALWAYS FOLLOWED.

10:10.568 --> 10:12.069
- WELL, WHO SAYS
I'M ALWAYS RIGHT?

10:12.153 --> 10:14.530
- YOU DO.

10:14.613 --> 10:15.740
BUT SINCE DAD HAS BEEN HERE,

10:15.823 --> 10:18.576
YOU'VE BEEN A LITTLE NOT YOU.

10:18.659 --> 10:23.831
SWEETHEART, I HAVEN'T FELT LIKE
THIS IN 25 YEARS.

10:23.914 --> 10:27.835
THAT MAN JUST
DOES SOMETHING TO ME.

10:27.918 --> 10:29.837
BUT WHO CAN EXPLAIN THE
MYSTERIES OF THE HUMAN HEART?

10:29.920 --> 10:33.424
- CHARLIE CAN,
BUT IT TAKES, LIKE, FOUR HOURS.

10:35.509 --> 10:37.136
I GUESS THE REAL QUESTION IS,

10:37.219 --> 10:38.054
ARE YOU HAPPY?

10:38.137 --> 10:39.680
- OF COURSE MY MAGGIE'S HAPPY,

10:39.764 --> 10:42.308
AND I'M ABOUT TO
MAKE HER HAPPIER.

10:42.391 --> 10:44.977
MAGPIE, FROM THE MINUTE
I SAW YOU,

10:45.061 --> 10:47.063
I KNEW WE WERE MEANT TO BE
TOGETHER FOREVER AGAIN.

10:47.146 --> 10:49.315
[laughter]

10:49.398 --> 10:54.028
MAGGIE TURNER,
WILL YOU REMARRY ME?

10:54.111 --> 10:56.072
- WHAT?

10:56.155 --> 10:58.991
- FRANKLIN TURNER,
YES, I WILL.

10:59.075 --> 11:00.951
- WHAT?

11:01.035 --> 11:01.869
NO, WAIT, WAIT.

11:01.952 --> 11:04.080
MOM, ISN'T THIS KIND OF SUDDEN?

11:04.163 --> 11:06.082
DON'T YOU AT LEAST
WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT?

11:06.165 --> 11:11.420
NAH, WHO NEEDS THINKING
WHEN I GOT MY MAN?

11:13.839 --> 11:16.050
- I REMEMBER
WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE,

11:16.133 --> 11:18.135
YOU USED TO EAT ALL THE POPCORN
BEFORE WE COULD STRING IT.

11:18.219 --> 11:19.804
- I DID?

11:19.887 --> 11:22.681
- SOME THINGS NEVER CHANGE,
LIKE YOUR MAMA.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.100
KIND OF FUNNY REALLY.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.685
I MEAN, WE BROKE UP PARTLY
BECAUSE SHE WAS SO CLINGY,

11:26.769 --> 11:28.104
BUT AS I GET ON IN YEARS,

11:28.187 --> 11:30.106
I FEEL I'M LESS
AND LESS INTERESTED

11:30.189 --> 11:32.108
IN THE FEISTY
MIND-HER-OWN TYPE OF GAL.

11:32.191 --> 11:33.692
- I'M SORRY.

11:33.776 --> 11:34.819
YOU ONLY WANT MOM
SO SHE CAN BE YOUR DOORMAT?

11:34.902 --> 11:37.613
- HEY, DON'T SELL
YOUR MOTHER SHORT.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.825
SHE'S A GREAT COOK TOO.

11:40.908 --> 11:42.576
- THERE YOU ARE,
GRANDPA FRANKLIN.

11:42.660 --> 11:44.328
I'VE BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

11:44.412 --> 11:45.413
- WHAT YOU NEED, JIMMY?

11:45.496 --> 11:48.249
- JIMMY?

11:48.332 --> 11:51.877
YEAH, JIMMY NEEDS YOU
TO COME TO THE OTHER ROOM.

11:51.961 --> 11:52.962
AARON AND I HAVE A LITTLE
PRESENTATION FOR YOU.

11:53.045 --> 11:54.296
- OKAY.

11:54.380 --> 11:56.465
- OH, JUST SO YOU KNOW,

11:56.549 --> 11:57.550
I WAS SHORT ON SUPPLIES,

11:57.633 --> 12:00.719
SO I HAD TO REUSE
AN OLD SCIENCE PROJECT,

12:00.803 --> 12:03.097
SO JUST IGNORE THE DRAWING
OF THE LARGE INTESTINE.

12:04.306 --> 12:07.601
- HEY.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.103
LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.021
MISTLETOE.

12:11.105 --> 12:12.273
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

12:12.356 --> 12:14.692
- CHARLIE, I DON'T HAVE TIME
FOR ROMANCE.

12:14.775 --> 12:17.153
I NEED TO GET MY MOM
TO DUMP MY DAD.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.280
- I'LL CALL THE AFTERNOON
TALK SHOWS,

12:19.363 --> 12:22.283
SEE IF I CAN
GET YOU THREE BOOKED.

12:22.366 --> 12:24.785
- HONEY, I NEVER SHOULD'VE
BROUGHT THEM BACK TOGETHER.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.495
THAT'S WHAT MY MOM
WAS AFRAID OF:

12:26.579 --> 12:27.955
NOT THAT THEY'D FIGHT,

12:28.038 --> 12:30.124
BUT WHAT SHE'D TURNED INTO
WHEN HE'S AROUND.

12:30.207 --> 12:32.334
- WELL, SIT 'EM DOWN
LIKE GROWN-UPS

12:32.418 --> 12:34.128
AND TALK TO 'EM
ABOUT THEIR LOVE LIFE.

12:34.211 --> 12:36.714
- I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT
MY PARENT'S LOVE LIFE.

12:36.797 --> 12:38.716
EWW. EWW.

12:38.799 --> 12:43.053
NOW ALL I SEE IS THEM
ON SOME BEAR SKIN RUG.

12:43.137 --> 12:45.681
- OH, THAT'S SILLY.

12:45.764 --> 12:48.392
EWW. EWW. EWW. EWW.

12:48.476 --> 12:50.478
THEY'RE CUDDLING.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.104
AND SHE'S THE BIG SPOON.

12:52.188 --> 12:52.688
- OH!

12:52.771 --> 12:53.814
GOD, CHARLIE.

12:56.817 --> 12:58.152
- SO, IN CONCLUSION,

12:58.235 --> 12:59.904
THE ENTIRE BODY WOULD SHUT DOWN

12:59.987 --> 13:01.489
AND NOT CALL YOU
ON YOUR BIRTHDAY

13:01.572 --> 13:05.284
IF IT ISN'T NOURISHED
WITH A STEADY DIET OF PRESENTS.

13:05.367 --> 13:06.994
THANK YOU, MERRY CHRISTMAS,
AND THE MALLS CLOSE AT 8:00.

13:10.164 --> 13:12.458
[clapping]

13:12.541 --> 13:14.710
- I'VE LEARNED A LOT.

13:14.793 --> 13:17.963
HOW ABOUT YOU,
GRANDPA FRANKLIN?

13:18.047 --> 13:19.965
- YEAH, THAT DOG WON'T HUNT.

13:20.049 --> 13:21.300
- WE DON'T NEED IT TO HUNT.

13:21.383 --> 13:24.762
WE NEED IT TO FETCH--
FETCH US A GIFT CARD.

13:24.845 --> 13:26.305
- GIFT CARDS
ARE A WASTE OF MONEY.

13:26.388 --> 13:27.556
- SERIOUSLY?

13:27.640 --> 13:29.183
GRANDKIDS, GRANDPA,
CHRISTMAS.

13:29.266 --> 13:31.852
IT'S NOT VOLUNTARY.

13:31.936 --> 13:32.728
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

13:32.811 --> 13:35.105
I HEAR YOU.
I HEAR YOU.

13:35.189 --> 13:38.150
HERE'S ANOTHER NICKEL.

13:38.234 --> 13:40.069
HALF THAT'S YOURS, CHAMP.

13:40.152 --> 13:41.237
- COME ON, AARON.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.488
LET'S GO
PUT OUR NICKELS TOGETHER

13:42.571 --> 13:43.614
AND BUY NOTHING.

13:45.533 --> 13:46.408
- OH!

13:46.492 --> 13:47.493
LOOK AT THE TIME.

13:47.576 --> 13:48.911
WE GOT TO GET THAT
EARLY BIRD SPECIAL.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.037
YOU COMING, MAGPIE?

13:50.120 --> 13:51.789
- MOM, I WAS HOPING
WE COULD TALK.

13:51.872 --> 13:52.748
- OH, ALL RIGHT.

13:52.831 --> 13:54.208
SWEETHEART, GO ON.

13:54.291 --> 13:54.750
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

13:54.833 --> 13:56.210
WARM UP THE CAR.

13:56.293 --> 13:58.462
- AND WASTE ALL THAT GAS?

13:58.546 --> 14:00.422
I'LL JUST JOG IN PLACE
TILL YOU GET THERE.

14:02.049 --> 14:05.010
- MOM, THIS WHOLE THING ABOUT
YOU AND DAD GETTING REMARRIED,

14:05.094 --> 14:06.804
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE GOOD
FOR EACH OTHER.

14:06.887 --> 14:08.597
ALL DAD CARES ABOUT IS HIMSELF.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.015
- THEN WE'RE PERFECT,

14:10.099 --> 14:12.726
BECAUSE ALL I CARE ABOUT
IS HIM TOO.

14:12.810 --> 14:13.852
MM!

14:13.936 --> 14:14.812
GOT TO GO, BABY.

14:14.895 --> 14:16.564
MY MAN IS WAITING.

14:16.647 --> 14:19.108
- WELL, ENJOY YOUR
EARLY BIRD SPECIAL.

14:19.191 --> 14:19.984
- MY WHAT?

14:20.067 --> 14:22.903
OH, YEAH, EARLY BIRD SPECIAL.

14:22.987 --> 14:23.988
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT WE CALL IT.

14:26.991 --> 14:28.284
both: EWW. EWW. EWW. EWW.

14:28.367 --> 14:28.993
- OH, GOD.

14:33.706 --> 14:34.623
- GOT A HAMMER?

14:34.707 --> 14:34.999
- NO, WHY?

14:39.169 --> 14:40.045
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

14:40.129 --> 14:41.422
THAT'S A FINE ELECTRONIC DEVICE.

14:41.505 --> 14:43.882
IT CAME ALL THE WAY FROM CHINA.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.801
- I'M TRYING TO GET IT OPEN.

14:45.884 --> 14:47.469
I THINK WHATEVER MY SECRET SANTA
REALLY GAVE ME

14:47.553 --> 14:48.512
WAS HIDDEN INSIDE.

14:48.596 --> 14:49.346
[rattling]

14:49.430 --> 14:51.724
LIKE A NECKLACE OR SOMETHING.

14:51.807 --> 14:53.934
- NO, HE WAS GOING TO GET YOU
A NECKLACE,

14:54.018 --> 14:55.561
BUT I TOLD HIM TO GET YOU
THIS THING INSTEAD.

14:55.644 --> 14:57.896
- HIM?
HIM WHO?

14:57.980 --> 15:01.650
- OWEN, THAT OBVIOUSLY DERANGED
GUY THAT LIKES YOU.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.069
- WAIT,
OWEN WAS MY SECRET SANTA.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.487
- HE CALLED
AND ASKED WHAT TO GET YOU.

15:05.571 --> 15:06.572
I TOLD HIM THIS.

15:06.655 --> 15:07.906
- WHAT?
WHY?

15:07.990 --> 15:09.158
- BECAUSE I KNEW YOU'D HATE IT,

15:09.241 --> 15:10.284
AND THEN I'D GET IT.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.829
BUT YOU COULDN'T TAKE
THE MOST OBVIOUS HINT.

15:13.912 --> 15:15.998
FOR EXAMPLE:
HINT, HINT.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.001
- OWEN WANTED TO GET ME
A NECKLACE,

15:19.084 --> 15:23.213
BUT INSTEAD YOU HAD HIM GET ME
SOME STUPID PLASTIC NOISE BOX?

15:23.297 --> 15:24.923
TEN, NINE, EIGHT--

15:25.007 --> 15:26.175
- WHY ARE YOU COUNTING?

15:26.258 --> 15:27.426
- I'D STOP ASKING
AND START RUNNING.

15:27.509 --> 15:29.178
- SANTA, GABBY'S BEING NAUGHTY.

15:29.261 --> 15:29.928
- SIX, FIVE, FOUR,
THREE, TWO, ONE!

15:37.353 --> 15:38.937
- CHARLIE, YOU'RE CLUMPING.

15:39.021 --> 15:41.231
I TOLD YOU TO DRAPE EVENLY
SO IT LOOKS NATURAL.

15:41.315 --> 15:44.526
- WHEN HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
THIS IN THE FOREST?

15:44.610 --> 15:45.653
- NEVER.

15:45.736 --> 15:48.530
BECAUSE IN THE FOREST,
IT'S NOT CLUMPY.

15:49.782 --> 15:52.409
- DO YOU THINK SANTA
WILL BE OKAY ON MACAROONS?

15:52.493 --> 15:54.119
- WELL, SANTA PREFERS
CHOCOLATE CHIP,

15:54.203 --> 15:56.163
BUT MRS. CLAUS
HAS HER TRADITIONS.

15:57.748 --> 15:59.917
- SORRY I'M LATE.

16:00.000 --> 16:00.626
- WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

16:00.709 --> 16:01.960
I WAS GETTING WORRIED.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.380
- OH, ALL YOU HAVE TO
WORRY ABOUT

16:04.463 --> 16:10.386
IS WHAT TO WEAR TO OUR WEDDING
TONIGHT IN VEGAS.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.137
OUR FLIGHT LEAVES AT 7:00.

16:14.181 --> 16:15.432
- FRANKLIN, IS THIS A DREAM?

16:15.516 --> 16:18.811
- IS THIS A JOKE?

16:18.894 --> 16:20.312
YOU'RE GONNA MISS CHRISTMAS?

16:20.396 --> 16:21.980
- NO, NO, NO, NO,
WE'RE GONNA HAVE IT RIGHT NOW.

16:22.064 --> 16:23.440
THE KIDS CAN OPEN THIS
RIGHT AWAY,

16:23.524 --> 16:24.316
AND THEN WE'LL SKEDADDLE.

16:24.400 --> 16:25.442
LOOK.

16:25.526 --> 16:26.318
THERE.
THERE YOU GO.

16:26.402 --> 16:27.778
THERE'S FOR THE LITTLE ONE.

16:27.861 --> 16:28.153
THERE YOU GO, JIMMY.

16:31.824 --> 16:36.036
- OH, GEE, A HAIRBRUSH
FROM THE 89 CENT STORE.

16:38.872 --> 16:42.000
- BRAN CEREAL?

16:42.084 --> 16:45.170
- RAISINS!

16:45.254 --> 16:47.631
- YOU TWO CAN GET TOGETHER
AND REALLY HAVE SOMETHING THERE.

16:47.715 --> 16:50.175
- YOU KNOW WHAT, KIDS,

16:50.259 --> 16:51.343
I'M GONNA SET YOU GUYS UP
TO WATCH TV IN OUR BEDROOM.

16:51.427 --> 16:54.263
- MAYBE SANTA WILL GET ME A TV
FOR MY BEDROOM.

16:54.346 --> 16:57.224
- MAYBE SANTA WILL GET YOU A JOB
TO HELP YOU PAY FOR IT.

16:59.518 --> 17:01.729
JAMES, TAKE YOUR PRESENTS
AND PUT THEM IN THE PANTRY.

17:01.812 --> 17:05.232
YOU CAN HAVE THEM
FOR CHRISTMAS BREAKFAST.

17:05.315 --> 17:06.150
- YAY!

17:07.693 --> 17:08.861
- DON'T WORRY.

17:08.944 --> 17:11.446
I GOT SOMETHING
FOR MY LITTLE GIRL TOO.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.991
- OH!

17:14.074 --> 17:15.576
PANTYHOSE EGG.

17:15.659 --> 17:19.496
AND COTTON BALLS.

17:19.579 --> 17:21.373
YOU KNOW ME SO WELL, DAD.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.625
- ACTUALLY, THOSE COTTON BALLS
ARE FOR CHARLIE.

17:23.709 --> 17:27.296
ALL RIGHT, LET'S TAKE YOU HOME
AND GET YOU PACKED, HUH?

17:27.378 --> 17:29.048
- AREN'T YOU
FORGETTING SOMETHING?

17:29.131 --> 17:30.215
- OH.

17:30.299 --> 17:31.967
FORGOT YOUR CHANGE.

17:32.050 --> 17:33.886
I HAD TO TAKE OUT THREE DOLLARS
FOR PARKING.

17:33.969 --> 17:36.180
- YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO PICK UP
AARON'S SPINNEVATOR

17:36.263 --> 17:37.306
THAT I HAD ON HOLD.

17:37.389 --> 17:38.348
- I DID.
I SOLD IT.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.267
- YOU SOLD THE SPINNEVATOR?

17:40.350 --> 17:42.811
- YEAH, HOW DO YOU THINK
I'M ABLE TO PAY FOR

17:42.895 --> 17:44.480
THIS VEGAS TRIP
PLUS ALL THESE GIFTS?

17:44.563 --> 17:47.316
YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS WALKING OUT
OF THE STORE WITH THAT THING,

17:47.399 --> 17:49.234
THESE TWO FRANTIC MOMS
OFFERED ME

17:49.318 --> 17:50.986
THIS OUTRAGEOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY
FOR IT.

17:51.069 --> 17:53.197
IT WOULD'VE BEEN IRRESPONSIBLE
OF ME NOT TO TAKE IT.

17:53.280 --> 17:55.657
- AARON REALLY WANTED
THAT SPINNEVATOR.

17:55.741 --> 17:56.658
- IT'S JUST A TOY.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.494
NEXT WEEK,
THERE'LL BE ANOTHER TOY.

17:58.577 --> 17:59.536
- HOLD UP.

17:59.620 --> 18:01.830
YOU HAD YOUR HANDS ON
A SPINNEVATOR,

18:01.914 --> 18:04.166
AND YOU GAVE AARON
RAISINS INSTEAD?

18:04.249 --> 18:05.125
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

18:05.209 --> 18:06.335
- WELL, RIGHT NOW I'M THINKING

18:06.418 --> 18:08.670
CHILDREN SHOULD BE SEEN
AND NOT HEARD.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.339
- WHO DOES THAT?

18:10.422 --> 18:12.800
YOU ARE THE MOST SELF-CENTERED
PERSON I HAVE EVER MET,

18:12.883 --> 18:17.012
AND I'VE BEEN TO KINDERGARTEN.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.598
- JAMES, DO NOT TALK TO
YOUR GRANDFATHER LIKE THAT.

18:19.681 --> 18:22.059
ALLOW ME.

18:23.268 --> 18:24.311
- UPSTAIRS, JAMES.

18:24.394 --> 18:26.730
SOMEONE'S HALLS
ARE ABOUT TO GET DECKED.

18:29.817 --> 18:34.029
- FRANKLIN,
YOU ARE A REAL PIECE OF WORK.

18:34.112 --> 18:35.364
YOU COME IN HERE,

18:35.447 --> 18:39.034
LAY YOUR HOODOO VOODOO ON ME,

18:39.117 --> 18:41.620
DRAG ME AWAY FROM MY FAMILY,

18:41.703 --> 18:46.708
THEN YOU STEAL THE ONE THING
MY GRANDBABY WANTS FOR CHRISTMAS

18:46.792 --> 18:51.547
AND REPLACE IT WITH SOME JUNK
FROM THE 89 CENTS STORE.

18:51.630 --> 18:55.342
AIN'T NOBODY WANT FIBER
FOR CHRISTMAS.

18:56.635 --> 18:57.344
- EXCUSE ME?

18:57.427 --> 18:59.555
- AND WHILE YOU ARE AT IT,

18:59.638 --> 19:03.016
SELL THAT IN FRONT OF
THE TOY STORE,

19:03.100 --> 19:06.895
BECAUSE I KNOW A CUBIC ZIRCONIA
WHEN I SEE ONE.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.397
- MM-HMM.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.440
- TALKING ABOUT FAKE JEWELRY,

19:10.524 --> 19:12.025
TAKE THOSE EARRINGS OFF.

19:12.109 --> 19:13.569
YOU LOOK LIKE STREET TRASH.

19:13.652 --> 19:17.197
- OH, I'VE MISSED YOU, MOMMY.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.157
- WAIT, ALL THIS RUCKUS
OVER SOME TOY?

19:19.241 --> 19:20.993
WHAT ABOUT OUR ROMANTIC WEEKEND
IN VEGAS?

19:21.076 --> 19:22.244
I'VE GOT THESE TICKETS.

19:22.327 --> 19:23.537
- YOU KNOW SOMETHING, FRANKLIN.

19:23.620 --> 19:25.289
I THINK IT'S TIME FOR YOU TO GO.

19:30.460 --> 19:31.920
- THANKS FOR INVITING ME,
STEPHANIE.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.589
I'M SORRY THINGS
DIDN'T WORK OUT.

19:33.672 --> 19:34.548
- ME TOO, DAD.

19:34.631 --> 19:36.592
MERRY CHRISTMAS.

19:36.675 --> 19:38.760
- YOU TOO, KIDDO.

19:38.844 --> 19:39.761
HEY, YOU STILL GOT
ALL THESE LIGHTS ON.

19:39.845 --> 19:42.097
MUST BE NICE.

19:49.897 --> 19:52.566
- YOU SENT HIM TO GET THAT TOY
ON PURPOSE, DIDN'T YOU?

19:52.649 --> 19:54.109
- YEP.

19:54.192 --> 19:56.486
I KNEW THE ONLY PERSON
YOU WOULD LISTEN TO WAS YOU.

19:56.570 --> 19:59.114
SO I GOT YOU TO SAY
WHAT YOU NEEDED TO HEAR.

20:00.824 --> 20:02.409
- I SURE TOLD ME.

20:04.536 --> 20:05.704
- MERRY CHRISTMAS, MOM.

20:05.787 --> 20:10.000
- MERRY CHRISTMAS, BABY.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.379
DIDN'T I TELL YOU
TO TAKE THOSE EARRINGS OFF?

20:19.551 --> 20:23.430
[clapping]

20:23.513 --> 20:24.473
- A SPINNEVATOR!

20:24.556 --> 20:26.642
- OH!

20:26.725 --> 20:28.435
I THOUGHT YOUR DAD SOLD THAT.

20:28.518 --> 20:29.603
- NOPE.

20:29.686 --> 20:30.979
THOSE TWO FRANTIC MOMS
OUTSIDE THE STORE

20:31.063 --> 20:33.023
WERE MY FRIENDS PAM AND ERICA.

20:33.106 --> 20:35.192
- HERE WE GO.

20:35.275 --> 20:36.193
- WAIT A SECOND.

20:36.276 --> 20:37.152
- THE HOTTEST...

20:37.235 --> 20:38.320
- HARDEST TO FIND...

20:38.403 --> 20:40.781
- MOST EXPENSIVE TOY
OF THE YEAR...

20:40.864 --> 20:42.157
- IS A YO-YO?
