WEBVTT

00:04.700 --> 00:07.224
What do you think
it's gonna do?

00:07.877 --> 00:09.574
Whoa!

00:17.191 --> 00:18.714
-Shall we?
-Yeah.

00:30.726 --> 00:32.380
End simulation.

00:34.991 --> 00:36.775
-End simulation.

00:41.737 --> 00:43.695
End simulation!

00:43.739 --> 00:45.219
End simulation!

00:52.661 --> 00:54.880
Why didn't you end simulation?

00:54.924 --> 00:57.535
Yeah, I tried. It didn't work.

00:57.579 --> 00:59.537
And the failsafe button?

00:59.581 --> 01:02.888
What, you mean that giant
red thing that screams
"Push me"?

01:02.932 --> 01:06.196
It's tied to your biometrics.
It appears when necessary.

01:06.240 --> 01:08.285
Yeah, it disappeared
the minute I reached for it.

01:09.286 --> 01:11.201
-What do you mean?
-I mean,

01:11.245 --> 01:13.725
your failsafe failed.

01:13.769 --> 01:16.728
Really? This is the first time
that I've ever encountered it,

01:16.772 --> 01:21.255
but your experience will be
reported to our
development team, Mr. Bates.

01:21.298 --> 01:24.214
I assure you,
this glitch will be fixed.

01:24.258 --> 01:27.217
Long before the launch of
Obsidian Platinum.

01:27.261 --> 01:30.264
I can handle his exit interview
from here, Ms. Olsen.

01:47.281 --> 01:49.805
Dreamer,
I'm sending him to you.

01:53.983 --> 01:55.506
Nap time.

02:01.338 --> 02:03.166
That was incredible!

02:03.210 --> 02:05.777
You beat my record
for defeating a Dominator.

02:05.821 --> 02:07.779
Well, you warmed him up
for me.

02:07.823 --> 02:10.130
Don't you have a date
to get to?

02:10.173 --> 02:12.784
Go! Get out of here.
I want pictures.

02:19.487 --> 02:21.489
Close off the street.
Secure the area.

02:27.190 --> 02:28.496
You're welcome...

02:29.497 --> 02:30.802
Director Dox.

02:30.846 --> 02:32.369
Thank you, Dreamer.

02:33.544 --> 02:34.893
Yes, um...

02:35.764 --> 02:37.461
Thank you.

02:37.505 --> 02:39.028
You already said that.

02:49.952 --> 02:51.693
Hey. What's the emergency?

02:51.736 --> 02:53.303
Blue or purple?

02:53.347 --> 02:55.566
-Oh, your date with
William is tonight.
-Yes.

02:55.610 --> 02:57.351
-Cancel it for me?
-No, I will not.

02:57.394 --> 02:59.701
And, blue. Always go with
the blue. You know this.

02:59.744 --> 03:01.572
I know. I know. But, I...

03:01.616 --> 03:03.705
It's been two and a half years
since I went on a date.

03:03.748 --> 03:05.663
What if I...

03:05.707 --> 03:07.361
forgot how to do it?

03:07.404 --> 03:09.667
You smile, and you laugh,
and your reach for the check.

03:09.711 --> 03:11.930
You make it sound
so easy.

03:11.974 --> 03:14.672
But the way, you should have
seen Nia today.
She was on fire.

03:14.716 --> 03:17.240
Yeah, I did.
She was all over YouTube

03:17.284 --> 03:19.677
and the news,
and every other platform
I've never hear of.

03:19.721 --> 03:21.853
I'm just so proud of her.

03:21.897 --> 03:25.205
And you know what, it just
feels so good to know that if
I want to take a night off,

03:25.248 --> 03:27.381
three's someone there
that can save the day.

03:27.424 --> 03:30.688
After a productive dinner
with Crown Prince
Raakaan el-Farah,

03:30.732 --> 03:32.951
philanthropist Lex Luthor
announced

03:32.995 --> 03:36.390
that Obsidian Platinum's
VR lenses will soon
be available in Quarac.

03:36.433 --> 03:37.739
Gross.

03:37.782 --> 03:40.394
Well, don't book your trip
to Bali just yet,

03:40.437 --> 03:42.700
-we still have to deal
with Lex.
-And we will.

03:42.744 --> 03:45.355
We will stop him
and get him out of the DEO

03:45.399 --> 03:47.792
and we'll get you back in there
where you belong.

03:48.576 --> 03:50.360
You miss it, don't you?

03:50.404 --> 03:52.797
Well, I mean,
I like to think that
the DEO misses me.

03:54.277 --> 03:57.280
But, yeah. Yeah, I miss it.

03:57.324 --> 04:00.283
But, hey, you know what,
I am blazing
a whole new trail here,

04:00.327 --> 04:04.548
and tonight I will be
having a date with this guy.

04:04.592 --> 04:07.377
Oh! Oh, is that,
that Martian weapon
J'onn gave you?

04:07.421 --> 04:09.379
-What do you call it,
the Hand of the Solider?
-Yeah.

04:09.423 --> 04:10.250
How's training?

04:11.294 --> 04:12.600
-Wanna see?
-Yeah.

04:13.949 --> 04:15.255
-Right?
-Mmm-hmm.

04:16.821 --> 04:18.301
-Ow! God, this...

04:20.041 --> 04:22.262
This thing is supposed to know
what I'm thinking,

04:22.305 --> 04:23.741
but it's being
very stubborn.

04:23.785 --> 04:26.570
Well, like soldier like hand.

04:26.614 --> 04:28.572
- Don't scare me!

04:33.621 --> 04:35.666
Isn't that Dreamer
something amazing?

04:35.710 --> 04:37.625
I think she's more powerful
than Supergirl.

04:37.668 --> 04:40.715
I don't know. I think she
probably has her problems
just like everyone else.

04:41.846 --> 04:43.674
Oh, no.

04:43.718 --> 04:45.763
You are not spending
another Friday night

04:45.807 --> 04:48.288
on this couch, in sweats
housing rocky road.

04:48.331 --> 04:49.811
I like ice cream.

04:50.159 --> 04:51.029
Nia.

04:51.682 --> 04:53.423
Sweet little Nia,

04:53.467 --> 04:55.817
you are becoming a...
what's the word?

04:55.860 --> 04:56.948
Loser.

04:56.992 --> 04:59.211
And you're young,
you're vibrant,

04:59.255 --> 05:02.127
but if you sit on this couch,
crying over that weird little
man for one more minute,

05:02.171 --> 05:03.955
you gonna develop
permanent mope face.

05:03.999 --> 05:06.480
I am not moping over...

05:06.523 --> 05:08.656
Barney. I just had
a long day.

05:08.699 --> 05:11.311
So, you need
an even longer night.
Come on.

05:11.354 --> 05:13.225
You going out with me.

05:13.269 --> 05:15.010
I'm meeting my boyfriend
at the club, and
I want you to meet him too.

05:15.053 --> 05:17.882
Wait. I didn't know you were
seeing anyone.
Where'd you meet him?

05:17.926 --> 05:20.145
We've been together
for three weeks.

05:20.189 --> 05:21.582
And we met on Upswipz.

05:23.235 --> 05:24.367
Yvette.

05:25.020 --> 05:27.370
"Loves sunsets,

05:27.414 --> 05:31.156
yachting, and hanging out
with my BFF Dreamer?"

05:31.200 --> 05:34.725
How often do you hang out
with your "BFF Dreamer?"

05:34.769 --> 05:36.988
She waved at me once.
That counts as a hey.

05:37.032 --> 05:39.513
Besides, everybody
embellishes on those things.

05:39.556 --> 05:41.950
-It's Angus.

05:44.431 --> 05:46.911
He says
he cannot wait to meet me.

05:46.955 --> 05:49.000
Wait, you haven't met him yet?

05:49.044 --> 05:51.351
Well, not physically,
but emotionally, it's like
we've been together forever.

05:51.394 --> 05:52.613
Now get dressed.

05:55.964 --> 05:58.749
Okay... all right.

05:58.793 --> 06:01.926
-So, you've never
played 8-Ball?
-What!

06:01.970 --> 06:04.581
Are you kidding me?
I'm from Midvale.

06:04.625 --> 06:06.888
-We have pool halls
on every corner, okay?
-Okay?

06:07.410 --> 06:09.281
Okay, fine.

06:09.325 --> 06:11.588
Maybe I've only played it
once in my life.

06:11.632 --> 06:14.374
Okay, well, then we'll take it
one shot at a time.

06:14.417 --> 06:15.505
For you.

06:15.549 --> 06:17.246
Oh, 'cause you're such
a pool shark?

06:17.289 --> 06:18.769
Oh, yeah. I'm not that bad.

06:18.813 --> 06:20.249
All right.

06:20.815 --> 06:22.382
All right.

06:22.425 --> 06:27.604
Let's just take it nice
and soft.

06:34.089 --> 06:36.134
-Beginner's luck?

06:47.798 --> 06:50.105
Ooh! I can't wait to dance
with my man.

06:53.282 --> 06:55.458
I have to go to
the bathroom.

06:55.502 --> 06:58.287
Don't take too long,
Angus will be here any minute.

07:02.465 --> 07:05.642
You know, I was gonna ask
if I can buy you a drink,
but I assume Angus

07:05.686 --> 07:07.731
has already spoken for you?

07:07.775 --> 07:10.647
He sure has.
Loud and clear.

07:10.691 --> 07:12.736
And I just missed
a text message from him.

07:12.780 --> 07:15.609
Ah, he wants me
to meet him outside.
Excuse me.

07:20.657 --> 07:21.832
Angus?

07:28.839 --> 07:29.666
An...

07:31.494 --> 07:33.496
-You leaving early tonight?
-Yeah.

07:35.237 --> 07:38.370
That place is way too crowded.

07:38.414 --> 07:41.286
-Did you find your boyfriend?
-No, he'll be here in a minute.

07:41.330 --> 07:42.374
Oh.

07:43.811 --> 07:45.813
He should have suggested that
you meet at sunset.

07:47.249 --> 07:48.642
What?

07:48.685 --> 07:52.297
You favorite time of day...
is on a yacht

07:52.341 --> 07:53.473
at sunset.

07:55.170 --> 07:59.000
At least that's what
you told me
in our first Upswipz chat.

07:59.043 --> 08:00.828
And I don't think
you'd lie to me.

08:02.917 --> 08:04.222
Would you do that?

08:10.359 --> 08:11.447
Yvette?

08:12.666 --> 08:14.189
Are you okay?

08:15.538 --> 08:17.366
Oh, my God,
what happened to you?

08:17.409 --> 08:19.324
Angus.

08:19.368 --> 08:21.152
Your boyfriend did this to you?

08:21.196 --> 08:23.024
He only pretended to like me.

08:23.590 --> 08:25.809
He targeted me

08:25.853 --> 08:28.333
so I can give this message
to Dreamer.

08:33.687 --> 08:36.341
"The world doesn't want
a trans superhero.

08:36.385 --> 08:39.996
So crawl back under
the rock you came from...

08:40.041 --> 08:43.914
came from, or I'll keep
attacking people like you."

08:54.272 --> 08:57.014
Our profiler put together
this sketch

08:57.058 --> 08:59.364
based on your statement.

08:59.408 --> 09:00.627
Is this the guy?

09:01.715 --> 09:05.022
-Yeah, that's him.
-Thank you.

09:05.066 --> 09:08.548
Now, we're still going over
security footage, and
questioning other patrons

09:08.591 --> 09:10.593
but, please,

09:10.637 --> 09:14.554
do not hesitate to call
if you remember anything
that may help us.

09:14.597 --> 09:15.642
Okay?

09:16.512 --> 09:17.948
I'll show you out.

09:20.472 --> 09:22.344
I'm gonna go lie down.

09:23.780 --> 09:25.434
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

09:26.304 --> 09:29.917
Nia? Nia?
Nia, thank goodness.

09:30.482 --> 09:31.962
Are you okay?

09:32.615 --> 09:34.617
Is Yvette?

09:34.661 --> 09:36.793
Why didn't you call me
last night?

09:36.837 --> 09:39.927
-I would have been there--
-Yvette wanted to be alone.

09:39.970 --> 09:43.452
She's not just hurt
and humiliated,
she's heartbroken.

09:45.672 --> 09:48.152
She thought this guy
really liked her.

09:48.196 --> 09:50.502
And he was just targeting her
because she was trans.

09:51.808 --> 09:53.549
He was trying to use her
to get to Dreamer.

09:54.637 --> 09:56.073
What did he want with Dreamer?

09:56.117 --> 09:58.119
He wants me to stop
being a superhero.

09:59.642 --> 10:02.645
He's going after my community
to bully me into it.

10:02.689 --> 10:05.735
Listen to me, Nia, listen.
We will find this guy.

10:05.779 --> 10:07.650
Yeah, we will.

10:07.694 --> 10:10.653
And when we do,
I'll bury him.

10:10.697 --> 10:11.785
Nia?

10:12.481 --> 10:14.483
Look, I...

10:14.526 --> 10:17.312
I know this is
a personal attack,

10:17.355 --> 10:21.098
but you have to trust that
when we find this guy the cops
are gonna put him behind bars.

10:21.142 --> 10:25.450
Kara, I love you, but do not
tell me what I can
and can't do right now.

10:25.494 --> 10:29.324
There is no catching this guy
and redeeming him.

10:29.367 --> 10:32.632
There is no hope speech
that can make this better.

10:32.675 --> 10:33.763
-Nia...
-No.

10:33.807 --> 10:35.983
Look, my community
is vulnerable.

10:37.419 --> 10:40.683
This happens more than
you could possibly know.

10:40.727 --> 10:44.121
And there are guys just like
this jerk out there

10:44.165 --> 10:46.471
who want to hurt us.

10:46.515 --> 10:49.561
They want us to hide
and to be afraid

10:49.605 --> 10:50.867
to be who we are.

10:50.911 --> 10:54.131
They wants us to disappear,
and it happens...

10:54.175 --> 10:56.307
-every day.
-I know,

10:56.351 --> 10:59.354
and what this guy did
is horrible--

10:59.397 --> 11:02.139
He's not the first,
and he won't be the last.

11:02.183 --> 11:04.664
And we haven't exactly been
a priority for the cops.

11:04.707 --> 11:08.755
So, just trust me when I say
that I am the one
protecting this community.

11:09.886 --> 11:12.715
And now this bastard
is going after

11:12.759 --> 11:15.065
my community,
trying to erase me?

11:16.023 --> 11:17.328
No.

11:17.372 --> 11:19.200
No, this guy is over.

11:24.292 --> 11:27.338
Look, I know that
you're hurting right now,

11:27.382 --> 11:30.515
and I will never
fully understand.

11:30.559 --> 11:32.082
But, between us and the cops,

11:32.126 --> 11:34.694
we will make sure
justice is served.

11:35.085 --> 11:36.391
Nia?

11:37.609 --> 11:38.959
Just give us a chance.

11:41.962 --> 11:43.050
Fine.

11:44.660 --> 11:45.922
A few hours.

11:48.055 --> 11:50.100
But then,
I'm doing this my way.

12:05.420 --> 12:07.074
I said shield!

12:10.207 --> 12:13.210
Alex, the Martian DNA
in your weapon

12:13.254 --> 12:15.778
will code itself to your
bio-electric pulses

12:15.822 --> 12:17.911
allowing you to morph it
with a single thought.

12:17.954 --> 12:19.869
But you have to let it in.

12:19.913 --> 12:21.871
Yeah. Okay, Ollivander.

12:21.915 --> 12:24.091
Is there any kind of
instruction manual
for this thing?

12:24.134 --> 12:26.049
I'm afraid not.
It's instinctual.

12:26.093 --> 12:28.051
Trust the weapon,
and it will trust you.

12:28.095 --> 12:31.489
How am I supposed to trust this
if it keeps changing on me?

12:34.144 --> 12:37.060
All right. Look,
I know things have been
difficult for you

12:37.104 --> 12:38.583
since leaving the DEO.

12:38.627 --> 12:40.672
Life can be challenging
when there's no clear path.

12:40.716 --> 12:42.413
Oh, no, no.
I have a clear path.

12:42.457 --> 12:45.895
Okay, it's stop Lex Luthor
from traipsing around the world

12:45.939 --> 12:48.637
just cashing in on the goodwill
that he never earned,

12:48.680 --> 12:50.204
and get my life back.

12:51.118 --> 12:52.597
Now, let's do it again.

12:52.641 --> 12:54.469
-What is that?

12:54.512 --> 12:57.646
J'onn, Alex, thanks for
seeing me this late.

12:57.689 --> 12:59.169
No problem, Al.

13:00.954 --> 13:02.520
My brother Trevor's missing.

13:03.347 --> 13:04.827
He lives in my basement, but

13:04.871 --> 13:06.437
I haven't seen him
for about a week.

13:06.481 --> 13:07.917
Did you file a police report?

13:07.961 --> 13:11.660
I did... but then the cops
found this on his computer.

13:14.881 --> 13:18.014
An invitation
to a weekend
escape experience

13:18.058 --> 13:20.451
at Obsidian Platinum's
Virtual Las Vegas.

13:20.495 --> 13:22.845
Invite says to get
a hotel room.

13:22.889 --> 13:26.196
So, no disturbances could
pull the players away from
their virtual experience.

13:26.240 --> 13:30.113
So the cops don't think that
he's missing. They think that
he's in some VR party binge.

13:30.157 --> 13:32.637
Right. But that was a week ago.

13:32.681 --> 13:35.118
Look, I'm telling you
this is not like Trevor at all.

13:35.162 --> 13:36.816
Al, do you mind taking me
to your house?

13:36.859 --> 13:38.861
I'd like to take a look around,
see what I can find.

13:38.905 --> 13:42.299
And Kelly works for
Obsidian North, so she can
get me into Virtual Vegas.

13:42.343 --> 13:44.824
And if there's a chance
that Trevor is in there,

13:44.867 --> 13:48.044
then I will find him,
and he can tell me
where he is in the real world.

13:48.088 --> 13:49.741
I really appreciate this.

13:49.785 --> 13:51.178
Hey, no problem, Al.

14:09.370 --> 14:10.762
Kara Danvers.

14:10.806 --> 14:12.677
I hope this is important,
I'm very busy.

14:12.721 --> 14:15.158
It is. It's about...

14:15.202 --> 14:16.986
-Dreamer.
-Yes.

14:17.030 --> 14:19.423
I just saw the coverage
of her victory over
the Dominator.

14:19.467 --> 14:22.600
No, it's not that.
She needs our help.

14:22.644 --> 14:25.690
There's an attacker targeting
the trans community

14:25.734 --> 14:27.257
trying to get Dreamer
to take her cape off.

14:28.041 --> 14:29.433
That's awful.

14:31.566 --> 14:35.396
I mean... it is only logical
that violence begets concern.

14:35.439 --> 14:38.399
Listen, I know
this guy's human,
but can you help me track him?

14:39.095 --> 14:40.749
Consider it done.

14:43.752 --> 14:47.234
So, the last thing that Al
knows is that his brother
checked himself in

14:47.277 --> 14:49.366
to some hotel who knows where,

14:49.410 --> 14:52.761
and that he met up with
some friends at a place
called the Escape Palace?

14:52.804 --> 14:55.720
Yeah, located somewhere
in Virtual Las Vegas.

14:55.764 --> 14:57.940
We figured that Trevor
must have paid cash
for his room,

14:57.984 --> 15:00.464
because there's no paper trail
of him anywhere.

15:00.508 --> 15:03.903
So, I was thinking maybe
I could go into
Virtual Las Vegas, and just

15:03.946 --> 15:06.209
-see what I could find.
-Okay.

15:06.253 --> 15:09.821
Now, these lenses
are very different
than the original.

15:09.865 --> 15:11.475
Okay?

15:11.519 --> 15:14.043
Obsidian Platinum doesn't just
utilize the brain link,

15:14.087 --> 15:15.827
it connects to your biology.

15:15.871 --> 15:17.568
Which means what exactly?

15:17.612 --> 15:21.050
So, in this version,
you're not just
seeing virtual reality,

15:21.094 --> 15:22.443
you're feeling it.

15:22.486 --> 15:25.402
Cold will feel cold,
hot will feel hot,

15:25.446 --> 15:27.100
everything will feel real.

15:27.143 --> 15:31.060
So, once you're in,
you'll be in,
what looks like a lobby.

15:31.104 --> 15:33.584
There you will select
your desired experience.

15:33.628 --> 15:36.283
You will see a panel
of virtual options,

15:36.326 --> 15:38.763
mined from your own
thoughts and desires.

15:38.807 --> 15:40.983
Virtual Las Vegas
is one of these.

15:41.027 --> 15:43.246
Okay, so what happens
when I get inside?

15:43.290 --> 15:44.900
What are the rules?

15:44.944 --> 15:48.121
That's the difference between
reality, and virtual reality.

15:48.164 --> 15:50.819
Inside Obsidian Platinum
there are no rules.

15:50.862 --> 15:53.343
Great. Sounds easy.

15:53.387 --> 15:56.172
You'll get the hang of it.
I promise.

15:56.216 --> 16:00.785
Just remember, if you need
to come out, say
"End simulation."

16:00.829 --> 16:02.657
And if, for some reason,

16:02.700 --> 16:05.138
it gets too intense in there
and you can't say that,

16:05.181 --> 16:07.270
the program will launch
your failsafe button.

16:07.314 --> 16:08.532
You can't miss it.

16:08.576 --> 16:10.099
Just touch it,
and you will be pulled out.

16:10.143 --> 16:11.971
And I'll be able
to communicate with you?

16:12.014 --> 16:13.146
The whole time.

16:14.669 --> 16:16.149
Okay, well...

16:16.845 --> 16:18.151
bottom's up.

16:21.937 --> 16:23.634
I'm in.

16:23.678 --> 16:26.724
Good. You should see
your experience options.

16:28.857 --> 16:30.032
Yeah, I do.

16:33.862 --> 16:35.777
Did you find Virtual Las Vegas?

16:37.170 --> 16:39.607
Yeah, I got it.
Hang on.

16:43.698 --> 16:45.482
There it is.

16:45.526 --> 16:46.701
Vegas, baby...

16:47.441 --> 16:49.530
Vegas.

16:59.366 --> 17:03.152
Well, I know where I can go
to find the Siegfried and Roy
interactive experience.

17:03.196 --> 17:04.935
No, thank you, but

17:04.980 --> 17:06.589
where am I gonna find
this Escape House?

17:06.634 --> 17:08.505
Talk to
the users inside.

17:08.549 --> 17:10.594
Someone must know
where it is.

17:10.637 --> 17:13.162
But stay away from the people
with three lines
on their necks,

17:13.205 --> 17:15.512
-those are NPCs.
-What ae NPCs?

17:15.556 --> 17:17.601
Non-Player Characters.

17:17.645 --> 17:19.255
AIs who populate the world,

17:19.299 --> 17:20.865
not actual users.

17:20.909 --> 17:22.650
-They won't know much.
-Okay.

17:28.786 --> 17:31.920
He said he
was meeting with some
virtual friends in VR?

17:31.963 --> 17:33.878
Yeah, but I don't know
who they are.

17:33.922 --> 17:36.185
I don't even know
their avatar names.

17:36.229 --> 17:37.752
Well, let's see
what we can find.

17:41.016 --> 17:44.715
I just don't understand.
When Trevor and I first came
to this planet together,

17:44.759 --> 17:46.543
we were inseparable.

17:46.587 --> 17:48.371
But, for the last few months,

17:48.415 --> 17:50.373
all he does
is retreat into VR.

17:51.809 --> 17:53.811
What is it?

17:53.855 --> 17:57.641
I managed to track down the
user names of two of Trevor's
virtual friends.

17:57.685 --> 17:59.556
We can get these to Kelly
at Obsidian North,

17:59.600 --> 18:01.558
maybe she can help us
find out who they are.

18:01.602 --> 18:03.778
That way maybe we could
maybe find Trevor.

18:03.821 --> 18:07.216
Look, Al, do you have
anything personal of Trevor's?

18:07.260 --> 18:10.001
Something with an emotional
connection that
I could maybe use

18:10.045 --> 18:11.481
to psychically trace him.

18:17.270 --> 18:19.620
I gave this to Trevor
to mark our first year
on Earth.

18:21.187 --> 18:22.536
He wore it every day.

18:23.885 --> 18:25.626
Till he switched to
a smart watch.

18:26.801 --> 18:28.324
Thanks, man.

18:28.368 --> 18:30.674
Hey, look,
we're gonna find him.

18:42.077 --> 18:43.426
Oh.

18:43.470 --> 18:45.602
Hey, you think
real Vegas buffets
are intense,

18:45.646 --> 18:48.953
you need to try the
all you can eat to get you to
he perfect state of fullness.

18:48.997 --> 18:50.781
No matter how much you eat,
you feel great.

18:50.825 --> 18:53.306
I'll keep that in mind
for the next time. Thank you.

18:53.349 --> 18:56.135
You wouldn't happen to know
where I can find a place called

18:56.178 --> 18:57.484
the Escape Palace, do you?

18:57.527 --> 18:59.007
Escape Palace?

18:59.050 --> 19:01.357
You mean that
spooky looking joint
up on the hill?

19:01.401 --> 19:03.446
Ridiculous add-on
if you ask me.

19:03.490 --> 19:05.796
They don't have hills like that
in the desert.

19:05.840 --> 19:08.364
Right, uh... thanks.

19:08.408 --> 19:10.714
-Sure thing, kid.
- Hey, blue eyes,
bring me the lobster.

19:10.758 --> 19:12.238
So many calories.

19:12.281 --> 19:14.065
He's right. That house is a recent add-on,

19:14.109 --> 19:15.328
customized by a user.

19:15.371 --> 19:16.938
Okay, so what does that mean?

19:16.981 --> 19:19.158
Advanced users can
customize the virtual world,

19:19.201 --> 19:22.813
but it takes time to catalogue these additions in our system.

19:22.857 --> 19:24.859
-So, I don't know what
we can expect.

19:24.902 --> 19:27.775
Well, if Trevor's in there,
then I gotta check it out.

19:29.080 --> 19:30.560
I'm going in.

19:32.345 --> 19:33.868
-I don't like this.

19:37.785 --> 19:39.134
Oh, my God.

19:40.788 --> 19:43.704
This is just like when
Rick Malverne tried
to drown me.

19:49.275 --> 19:53.235
Okay, the user who created
this palace

19:53.279 --> 19:55.716
designed it to tap into
a player's worst fears.

19:55.759 --> 19:58.197
That makes the experience
different for everyone.

19:58.240 --> 19:59.763
And harder to escape.

19:59.807 --> 20:02.201
But, this isn't real,

20:02.244 --> 20:03.767
there's nothing to be
afraid of.

20:03.811 --> 20:05.856
Help. We've been trapped
for days.

20:05.900 --> 20:07.249
Wait, you can talk?

20:07.293 --> 20:09.077
End your simulation.

20:09.904 --> 20:11.253
I can't.

20:11.297 --> 20:12.776
It's part of the game.

20:12.820 --> 20:14.604
Then the failsafe disappeared.

20:14.648 --> 20:16.867
What? I reported that glitch
months ago.

20:16.911 --> 20:18.347
Somebody must have hacked it.

20:18.391 --> 20:20.654
Alex, you need to get them
out of there.

20:20.697 --> 20:23.222
If they've been tortured
for days, there could be
serious repercussions.

20:23.265 --> 20:25.049
I thought you said
this wasn't real?

20:25.093 --> 20:27.704
But they think it is,
and with Obsidian Platinum,

20:27.748 --> 20:30.533
it feels real.
This is why we have a failsafe.

20:30.577 --> 20:32.535
-It's encoded
with a biometric--
-Okay, Kelly,

20:32.579 --> 20:34.668
just in English.
What are you saying?

20:34.711 --> 20:38.237
If you don't break through
those tanks right now,
they could suffer brain damage.

20:38.280 --> 20:39.194
Okay.

20:43.329 --> 20:44.591
All right.

20:52.599 --> 20:54.731
- You did it.

20:54.775 --> 20:57.821
Okay, now give me the names
and locations, so I can send
teams in to eject them.

20:57.865 --> 20:59.562
Tell your teams to hurry.

20:59.606 --> 21:02.478
On it. I'm gonna figure out
why the failsafe
didn't trigger.

21:02.522 --> 21:04.741
Listen, I'm gonna
get you guys out of here.

21:04.785 --> 21:07.266
But we're looking for a man
named Trevor Crane.

21:07.309 --> 21:09.268
Have you seen him in here?

21:09.311 --> 21:11.661
Trevor's done a bunch
of escape rooms with us.

21:11.705 --> 21:14.447
He and the new guy Richard

21:14.490 --> 21:16.492
solved the puzzle quickly
and made it through,

21:16.536 --> 21:18.146
but that door slammed shut.

21:20.191 --> 21:23.499
We were about to follow
when spiders suddenly started
crawling all over me.

21:23.543 --> 21:24.935
And I hate spiders.

21:24.979 --> 21:27.198
Whose idea was it to come
to this escape experience?

21:28.156 --> 21:29.200
It was Richard's.

21:30.071 --> 21:31.507
How well do you know him?

21:31.551 --> 21:33.466
He's new to the group.

21:33.509 --> 21:36.947
I need to get to him
before it's too late.

21:36.991 --> 21:41.169
So, you're saying this
Richard person intentionally
dropped Trevor in VR?

21:41.212 --> 21:42.431
It looks that way.

21:42.475 --> 21:44.215
He's figured out
a glitch in the system

21:44.259 --> 21:46.435
that prevents people from
safely ejecting.

21:46.479 --> 21:49.743
Well, I followed the psychic
trail from Trevor's watch to
a house outside Opal City.

21:50.744 --> 21:52.485
I'll let you know
what I find out.

21:56.663 --> 21:57.751
Excuse me.

21:59.666 --> 22:01.668
-Can I help you?
-I hope you can.

22:19.903 --> 22:23.037
Hi, Detective Rivers,
it's Nia Nal.

22:23.080 --> 22:25.344
I wanted to see if there
was any updates on
Yvette's assault.

22:25.387 --> 22:28.651
We're still reviewing
surveillance footage from the
club and surrounding businesses

22:28.695 --> 22:31.219
and processing
the physical evidence.

22:31.262 --> 22:33.352
So, you're saying
you're nowhere?

22:33.395 --> 22:37.051
I can assure you,
I will do everything in
my power to catch him.

22:38.400 --> 22:39.880
I appreciate that.

22:43.884 --> 22:45.451
I gave you your chance.

22:47.322 --> 22:48.584
Sorry, Kara.

22:50.456 --> 22:53.546
Now it's time to do
everything in my power.

22:58.812 --> 23:00.074
Come and get me.

23:03.904 --> 23:08.212
Mrs. Bates, are you sure
you don't know Trevor Crane?

23:08.256 --> 23:10.519
A number of leads
have led me to this address.

23:10.563 --> 23:12.391
Perhaps he's using an alias?

23:12.434 --> 23:15.045
No. Sorry.

23:15.089 --> 23:16.525
Could he be a friend
of your spouse's?

23:16.569 --> 23:19.572
No, I don't think I've
ever heard Richard mention him.

23:19.615 --> 23:21.835
-Your husband's name
is Richard?
-Yes.

23:24.751 --> 23:28.232
Jennifer, I'm gonna need you
to stop lying to me.

23:28.276 --> 23:31.235
Right now, Trevor is trapped
in a high-level
virtual reality experience

23:31.279 --> 23:32.889
by a man named Richard.

23:32.933 --> 23:35.631
-Possibly being tortured.
-But that's not possible.

23:35.675 --> 23:37.938
-So, you do know him?
-Yes.

23:38.939 --> 23:40.244
Kind of.

23:40.288 --> 23:42.595
We've been spending
some time together in VR.

23:42.638 --> 23:44.248
-Like an affair?
-No.

23:44.292 --> 23:46.120
I have never met him
in real life.

23:46.860 --> 23:49.602
It's just harmless fun.

23:49.645 --> 23:51.778
Does your husband know
about this...

23:52.300 --> 23:53.606
harmless fun?

23:56.783 --> 24:00.047
My husband can be a little...

24:03.311 --> 24:04.791
possessive.

24:04.834 --> 24:07.489
So, I do my thing in VR,
and he does his.

24:07.533 --> 24:09.926
He's a computer engineer
in love with all
the technical details,

24:09.970 --> 24:11.885
and me, I just want to

24:12.625 --> 24:14.757
escape for a few hours.

24:14.801 --> 24:18.979
Regardless, I need to
find Trevor and your husband
as soon as possible.

24:19.022 --> 24:21.198
Or they could both suffer
permanent damage.

24:26.987 --> 24:28.205
Director Dox?

24:30.338 --> 24:32.949
I found over 200
social media groups,
and message boards,

24:32.993 --> 24:34.516
all catering to
trans hate groups.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.257
-They're on this drive.
-Thank you.

24:40.261 --> 24:41.523
That will be all.

24:58.845 --> 25:01.891
-It's no use.
-J'onn located Richard's wife.

25:01.935 --> 25:03.806
Richard's a
computer programmer.

25:03.850 --> 25:07.549
We think that he made
the escape experience
as a way to trap Trevor

25:07.593 --> 25:10.509
because Trevor was having
a virtual affair with
Richard's wife.

25:10.552 --> 25:11.988
Oh, you've got to be
kidding me.

25:12.032 --> 25:14.382
I know, and I need to have
a conversation with Andrea

25:14.425 --> 25:17.690
-about unintended uses
of Obsidian Platinum.
-All right.

25:17.733 --> 25:20.257
Now, any ideas of how
I can get through this door?

25:20.301 --> 25:23.826
If you concentrate hard enough,
you can override
Richard's program.

25:23.870 --> 25:26.220
Bend it to your will,
not his.

25:31.486 --> 25:32.879
-I did it.

25:43.977 --> 25:45.587
Kelly?

25:45.631 --> 25:48.068
It is totally different
in here.

25:49.504 --> 25:51.288
Kelly?

25:51.332 --> 25:53.769
-Can you hear me?
-Alex?

25:53.813 --> 25:55.336
Alex, are you there?

25:56.598 --> 25:58.513
This shouldn't be possible,

25:58.557 --> 26:00.950
but it looks like Richard
customized the room to block
remote monitoring.

26:00.994 --> 26:02.256
Hello?

26:03.823 --> 26:04.998
Trevor?

26:05.607 --> 26:07.087
Okay.

26:08.088 --> 26:09.568
I'm going in.

26:14.616 --> 26:17.663
Maybe put Yvette's quote
at the top of the third graph.

26:18.446 --> 26:19.534
Brilliant.

26:21.667 --> 26:25.758
"Over 24 trans people have been
murdered in this country
in the past year."

26:26.802 --> 26:29.152
The true number's
likely much higher.

26:29.196 --> 26:31.111
Many of these attacks
go mis-reported

26:31.154 --> 26:33.287
because victims are
misgendered in police reports.

26:34.288 --> 26:36.638
Nia was so angry.

26:36.682 --> 26:39.293
I get it,
this is so frustrating.

26:39.336 --> 26:41.469
I wish we could
do more to help.

26:43.993 --> 26:45.516
Hang on.

26:46.648 --> 26:47.997
Brainy, what's up?

26:48.041 --> 26:51.087
I'm sending you
an Upswipz profile Nia created.

26:51.131 --> 26:53.263
It appears she's trying to
lure out Yvette's attacker

26:53.307 --> 26:54.700
by using herself as bait.

26:57.964 --> 27:00.314
I'll talk to her,
and, Brainy,

27:00.357 --> 27:01.663
thank you.

27:05.493 --> 27:07.277
So, something came up,

27:07.321 --> 27:09.497
-would you mind...
-Covering for you?

27:09.540 --> 27:10.541
Of course.

27:19.333 --> 27:20.900
You wanted Dreamer,

27:22.336 --> 27:23.990
well, now you've got her.

27:36.002 --> 27:37.177
Trevor Crane?

27:40.006 --> 27:41.398
I'm Alex Danvers.

27:42.748 --> 27:44.314
Your brother sent me.

27:44.358 --> 27:46.534
Oh, thank God.

27:47.753 --> 27:49.015
It's happening again.

27:49.885 --> 27:51.495
Stay back!

27:51.539 --> 27:52.366
What?

27:54.281 --> 27:56.152
Please make it stop!

27:56.196 --> 27:58.546
Okay, I don't understand,
just talk to me.

27:58.589 --> 27:59.721
-Trevor?

28:03.116 --> 28:04.552
What the hell just happened?

28:05.074 --> 28:06.772
I don't know.

28:06.815 --> 28:10.166
At first, I thought
I was standing on
some kind of a land mine.

28:10.210 --> 28:11.994
If I take a step,
I explode, but

28:12.038 --> 28:14.431
standing still doesn't
work either. I still blow up.

28:14.475 --> 28:16.042
It's random.

28:16.085 --> 28:17.260
And the pain...

28:18.609 --> 28:21.874
-it's horrible.
-Okay, just... focus.

28:21.917 --> 28:23.266
Okay, where is Richard?

28:23.310 --> 28:24.920
I don't know.

28:24.964 --> 28:27.531
I think he planned
this whole thing.

28:27.575 --> 28:30.883
Sometimes he shows up
just to watch me explode.

28:30.926 --> 28:33.015
-It's happening again.
-No, you can fight this.

28:33.059 --> 28:34.582
-You just have to--
-Look out.

28:41.937 --> 28:44.070
End your simulation.

28:44.113 --> 28:46.637
-I am not leaving here
without Trevor.
-Yeah?

28:47.638 --> 28:49.771
Okay, well, then
I'm gonna show you

28:49.815 --> 28:51.164
how real this can be.

28:52.121 --> 28:54.123
'Cause this is my house!

28:54.820 --> 28:57.083
And this is my gun.

29:04.133 --> 29:05.787
You're not getting rid of me
that easily.

29:12.359 --> 29:13.621
Easy, tiger.

29:16.537 --> 29:17.930
Are you okay?

29:24.110 --> 29:25.764
Get back.
I can't control it.

29:25.807 --> 29:27.678
No, no, I'm not going anywhere.

29:27.722 --> 29:31.291
And you can control this,
Trevor. You need to
will it to stop.

29:31.334 --> 29:32.945
All right,
you make the rules now.

29:34.033 --> 29:35.295
Come on.

29:36.949 --> 29:38.472
That's it.

29:38.515 --> 29:40.517
That's it.
You got this.

29:44.957 --> 29:47.437
-It worked.
-Yeah.

29:47.481 --> 29:50.440
-You were right.
-I knew you could do it.

29:50.484 --> 29:52.791
All right, listen to me.
Give me your location.

29:52.834 --> 29:54.183
I will go out
and I will get help.

29:54.227 --> 29:56.359
I'm at the National City Grand.

29:56.403 --> 29:59.580
-Room 315.
-Okay, you just hang on
and you try to stay calm.

30:00.146 --> 30:01.712
End simulation.

30:05.151 --> 30:06.935
Alex, I couldn't reach you.
What happened in there?

30:06.979 --> 30:09.677
I just fought Richard,
blasted him clean out of VR.

30:09.720 --> 30:11.853
But how?
That shouldn't be possible.

30:11.897 --> 30:13.637
We'll figure that out later.

30:13.681 --> 30:15.030
I found Trevor.

30:15.074 --> 30:16.989
I'm gonna call J'onn
and give him his address.

30:17.903 --> 30:21.645
No, I'll get him.

30:21.689 --> 30:24.344
But I need you to send
a paramedics to
the Coastline Motel.

30:25.345 --> 30:26.520
Room 10.

30:34.920 --> 30:36.835
-Looking for me?

30:38.184 --> 30:39.838
You weren't supposed
to be here.

30:43.537 --> 30:45.495
Got something you wanna say?

30:45.539 --> 30:46.714
Yeah.

30:49.369 --> 30:51.501
I don't think

30:51.545 --> 30:53.590
you're the right kind
of role model.

30:53.634 --> 30:56.332
-That's not for you
to decide.
-Well,

30:56.376 --> 30:58.508
somebody has to stand up
to you people.

30:58.552 --> 31:02.338
You stand up by hiding behind
a fake name online?

31:02.382 --> 31:04.123
And by attacking
innocent people?

31:06.647 --> 31:07.866
It worked, didn't it?

31:24.404 --> 31:27.015
-You make me sick.
-No, you make me sick,

31:27.059 --> 31:28.451
you twisted freak!

31:28.495 --> 31:30.540
You show up on the scene
one day tricking dudes

31:30.584 --> 31:32.760
into thinking that
you're this hot new superhero.

31:32.803 --> 31:34.370
The girl next door,

31:34.414 --> 31:37.417
but heroes are supposed to
be virtuous,

31:37.460 --> 31:39.549
and honest, and here you are

31:39.593 --> 31:40.594
lying!

31:41.421 --> 31:43.814
I get it.

31:43.858 --> 31:47.775
Your fragile ego
was just shattered.

31:47.818 --> 31:50.256
Your sense of self
is so shaky,

31:50.299 --> 31:54.086
that anything outside
your narrow world view
threatens it.

31:55.087 --> 31:57.393
Dreamer, don't.

31:57.437 --> 31:59.918
Stay out of this.
This is my fight!

31:59.961 --> 32:01.920
And you won.
Look at him.

32:03.617 --> 32:06.489
Don't let him turn you
into something you're not.

32:06.533 --> 32:08.709
Why should he get to live?

32:08.752 --> 32:12.756
If you do this, you will take
a piece of his darkness and
carry it with you forever.

32:12.800 --> 32:15.977
When you put that suit on,
you became a symbol.

32:16.021 --> 32:19.241
You give people hope.
Don't let them down

32:19.285 --> 32:21.765
by stooping to his level.

32:21.809 --> 32:23.985
Now, please, let's just
turn him in

32:24.029 --> 32:25.639
and make sure
he faces justice.

32:25.682 --> 32:27.336
You can't promise
that'll happen.

32:27.380 --> 32:28.642
No, I can't.

32:30.470 --> 32:33.299
And I understand...

32:33.342 --> 32:35.997
You feel like you're
the only one protecting
your community,

32:36.041 --> 32:37.520
but you're not alone.

32:38.913 --> 32:40.132
You have me.

32:42.003 --> 32:44.832
And Alex and J'onn and, yes,

32:44.875 --> 32:47.008
even Brainy
in his heart of hearts.

32:47.052 --> 32:49.880
And maybe we all
should have opened
our eyes to the realities

32:49.924 --> 32:51.839
that your and your community
face every day.

32:51.882 --> 32:54.015
But now we have.

32:54.059 --> 32:56.626
And now we will all have
our eyes open

32:56.670 --> 32:57.976
for people like him.

33:08.334 --> 33:10.814
You are going to prison

33:10.858 --> 33:14.122
-for a long time.

33:14.166 --> 33:15.994
And when you're out,

33:16.037 --> 33:18.474
I will be watching you.

33:18.518 --> 33:20.824
And if you ever

33:20.868 --> 33:24.828
make a move against anyone
in my community again,

33:24.872 --> 33:26.569
I will give you a nightmare

33:26.613 --> 33:30.356
you will never
wake up from.

33:49.375 --> 33:50.898
Nia?

33:52.204 --> 33:55.033
Hey. Hey. It's okay.

33:55.076 --> 33:57.905
Kara, I almost murdered
someone tonight...

33:59.559 --> 34:01.865
and I still
kind of want to.

34:01.909 --> 34:03.215
I know.

34:03.258 --> 34:05.217
I don't wanna be a killer,
but...

34:08.306 --> 34:10.222
Kara, I'm not okay.

34:12.224 --> 34:15.357
I am so overwhelmed.

34:15.400 --> 34:18.099
And this guy
just triggered everything.

34:21.014 --> 34:22.799
I had a dream flash

34:24.757 --> 34:29.545
right before Yvette
was attacked and
I couldn't interpret it.

34:29.589 --> 34:32.809
I couldn't save Yvette,
just like I couldn't
save my mom.

34:32.853 --> 34:35.072
I couldn't stop that guy
and my

34:35.116 --> 34:37.118
powers are mixed up

34:37.161 --> 34:38.946
and unpredictable!
And I...

34:39.512 --> 34:41.079
And the one person

34:42.167 --> 34:44.125
who supported me
from day one,

34:44.168 --> 34:46.909
who was always by my side,

34:46.954 --> 34:48.956
who saw me
for who I am, and...

34:51.958 --> 34:54.962
looked at me like
I was beautiful.

34:55.005 --> 34:56.616
It just broke my heart.

34:58.270 --> 35:00.141
And I don't even know why.

35:01.142 --> 35:03.492
I wish I had answers for you.

35:03.536 --> 35:05.364
I'm so sorry.

35:15.983 --> 35:19.856
When that bastard
attacked my community,

35:21.510 --> 35:24.296
the one thing
it felt like I had left...

35:26.036 --> 35:27.777
I snapped.

35:27.821 --> 35:30.780
At least this was something
I could control.

35:30.824 --> 35:34.784
I could find this guy
and stop him.

35:34.828 --> 35:36.612
Permanently.

35:36.656 --> 35:39.137
I could do something
to protect

35:39.833 --> 35:42.009
someone.

35:42.052 --> 35:44.011
I felt that kind of
pressure before.

35:44.577 --> 35:46.144
That anger...

35:48.058 --> 35:50.800
but I wasn't looking at things
through your eyes

35:50.844 --> 35:52.541
and your experiences...

35:54.108 --> 35:55.501
And I'm so sorry.

35:57.024 --> 35:59.287
And I know, I know,

35:59.331 --> 36:04.205
sometimes
being the good guy sucks.

36:04.249 --> 36:07.687
Especially when you know
how easy it would be
to just get rid of

36:07.730 --> 36:10.429
someone so vile
and full of hate.

36:12.126 --> 36:13.258
But, hey,

36:14.520 --> 36:17.000
not doing that...

36:17.044 --> 36:20.178
that is what makes us
different from them.

36:21.701 --> 36:24.007
That's what let's us
keep protecting people,

36:24.051 --> 36:26.836
and your community needs you.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.577
They need Dreamer.

36:30.710 --> 36:34.714
And I'm so sorry. I didn't know
how much pain you were in.

36:36.455 --> 36:38.065
-Oh!

36:42.374 --> 36:44.724
Okay,
relationship talk.

36:44.767 --> 36:48.031
Let's decide right now
that any virtual romance
is cheating.

36:48.075 --> 36:49.511
-Deal.
-Yeah.

36:49.555 --> 36:52.210
Also, virtual torture,

36:52.253 --> 36:54.690
that is definitely real
attempted murder.

36:54.734 --> 36:58.259
Yeah. There are a lot
of open questions

36:58.303 --> 37:01.915
about ethics and morality
in the virtual world.

37:02.916 --> 37:04.178
You okay?

37:05.397 --> 37:08.922
I do truly believe that
what we're...

37:08.965 --> 37:12.099
What I am doing at
Obsidian North can help people.

37:13.318 --> 37:15.885
I just, I feel so guilty

37:15.929 --> 37:21.151
and angry that someone would
take advantage of our
technology like that.

37:21.195 --> 37:23.066
Use our tools as a weapon?

37:23.110 --> 37:25.939
Maybe there should be some
regulations on who can use
Obsidian Platinum.

37:25.982 --> 37:27.636
I agree.

37:27.680 --> 37:31.074
But I flagged that glitch
months ago,

37:31.118 --> 37:33.207
and I was promised that
it was taken care of.

37:38.430 --> 37:39.779
Alex?

37:41.346 --> 37:42.608
Trevor.

37:43.304 --> 37:45.001
Hey, it's...

37:45.045 --> 37:46.612
It's so good to see you out.

37:46.655 --> 37:49.136
I'm so glad that you're okay.

37:49.179 --> 37:51.312
I really wanted to meet you

37:51.356 --> 37:53.880
in the real world,
to thank you.

37:55.447 --> 37:56.883
You saved my life.

37:58.667 --> 37:59.886
Wanna have a drink?

38:00.626 --> 38:02.018
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

38:02.062 --> 38:03.150
-This is Kelly.
-Hi.

38:03.193 --> 38:04.978
-Hi.
-She's kind of
part of it, too.

38:16.076 --> 38:18.470
We don't have to worry
about that creep anymore.

38:18.513 --> 38:20.254
He's going to prison
for a long time.

38:24.693 --> 38:26.434
What are you doing?

38:26.478 --> 38:28.610
Deleting my Upswipz account.

38:28.654 --> 38:30.612
And all social media accounts.

38:30.656 --> 38:32.135
Yvette, you can't do that.

38:32.179 --> 38:35.443
I have had it
with putting myself out there.

38:35.487 --> 38:37.880
Making myself an easy target.
I'm done.

38:37.924 --> 38:39.708
He was just one bad person.

38:39.752 --> 38:41.493
You can
tell yourself that, Nia,

38:41.536 --> 38:42.494
like I did,

38:43.712 --> 38:45.366
but I should have known better.

38:47.281 --> 38:49.152
I'm a trans woman of color.

38:49.196 --> 38:50.676
Okay, I know what
we're up against.

38:54.767 --> 38:57.509
I wanted Angus
so badly to be real.

38:59.728 --> 39:03.210
For someone to care about me,
to get me, to adore me.

39:05.430 --> 39:08.650
-It never got to be true.
-It will be.

39:08.694 --> 39:11.697
You will find that kind
of love, Yvette, but not
if you shut down.

39:17.224 --> 39:19.357
They want us to be invisible...

39:21.533 --> 39:23.230
because of their own fears.

39:24.579 --> 39:26.364
They want to erase us

39:26.407 --> 39:29.105
so we need to shine
even brighter.

39:31.586 --> 39:33.371
You are a beautiful woman.

39:35.242 --> 39:37.287
Big beautiful life,

39:37.331 --> 39:41.291
and sharing that life
is what will change this world.

39:48.081 --> 39:50.213
The bigot you arrested,
Gregory Bauer,

39:50.257 --> 39:53.521
belongs to an online hate group
specifically targeting
the trans community.

39:53.565 --> 39:55.741
I took the liberty
of identifying its users.

39:55.784 --> 39:59.309
The group boasts about
future attacks and
takes credit for others.

39:59.353 --> 40:02.704
I believe you will find
some leads to
your cold cases in there.

40:02.748 --> 40:05.228
I... I don't know
what to say.

40:05.272 --> 40:09.276
The DEO takes threats
against our sister superheroes
very seriously.

40:14.368 --> 40:15.935
Ready for another round?

40:17.763 --> 40:19.895
Come on!

40:19.939 --> 40:22.463
I can make you do anything
in the virtual world!

40:22.507 --> 40:23.812
But that wasn't
your real weapon, Alex.

40:26.162 --> 40:28.469
You have to give it time
to bond to you.

40:29.601 --> 40:31.124
Let's do this again tomorrow.

40:32.517 --> 40:34.432
J'onn, really?

40:39.175 --> 40:40.394
Mom, hey.

40:41.482 --> 40:42.701
What's wrong?

40:52.362 --> 40:53.451
Alex?

40:55.191 --> 40:56.323
What is it?

40:58.630 --> 41:00.022
Mom just called me.

41:01.371 --> 41:02.634
They found Dad.

41:03.417 --> 41:04.984
Jeremiah?

41:07.160 --> 41:08.466
He's dead.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.132
There you go, Mr. Bates,

41:23.176 --> 41:25.091
you just rest easy.

41:25.831 --> 41:27.267
I've got you now.
