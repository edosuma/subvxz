00:20.419 --> 00:22.086
The burglar reportedly went in...

00:26.091 --> 00:28.226
You gotta hit it just right.

00:28.260 --> 00:30.197
Linda, please use the ladder,
or at least let me do it.

00:30.229 --> 00:31.396
I'm fine, Bob.

00:32.398 --> 00:33.431
Just gotta find the sweet spot.

00:35.134 --> 00:37.079
Lin, I'm gonna come over
and steady your legs. All right?

00:39.505 --> 00:42.740
There. You see? Got it.
Have a little faith, you know?

00:42.741 --> 00:44.909
I'm not some clumsy idiot
who can't... whoa!

00:44.944 --> 00:46.444
Linda... y-you okay?

00:46.479 --> 00:48.947
I'm fine, Bob, I just slipped.
Ow! Damn it!

00:51.250 --> 00:54.252
- Ow. That l-looked like it hurt.
- It's not funny, Bob!

00:54.286 --> 00:56.988
Check, please.
I know that sounds
like I'm saying, "Check, please,"

00:57.022 --> 00:59.357
but I actually should be going.
So check, please.

00:59.358 --> 01:00.725
Uh-oh. My wallet is missing.

01:00.759 --> 01:03.228
Better start washing dishes.

01:03.262 --> 01:06.097
I hope I didn't lose it.
I'd hate to have my identity stolen.

01:06.132 --> 01:07.565
I'm sure they'd give it right back.

01:07.600 --> 01:10.320
- Maybe check the bathroom.
- It's worth a try.

01:10.336 --> 01:13.605
Now's my chance to sit in his stool
and get the Mort experience.

01:13.606 --> 01:15.607
Oh... Oh...!

01:15.641 --> 01:17.108
You were right!

01:17.109 --> 01:18.810
- It was behind the toilet!
- Oh, good...!

01:18.844 --> 01:22.013
Also, there was a rubber band,
a marble and a toothbrush.

01:22.014 --> 01:23.166
Those are mine!

01:23.182 --> 01:25.150
It's probably a telemarketer.

01:25.151 --> 01:26.618
Bob's Burgers.

01:26.619 --> 01:27.819
No, I don't have
anything to refinance.

01:27.820 --> 01:29.454
I wish I did.

01:29.455 --> 01:32.857
Unfortunately, my only equity
is in my car and, hello?

01:32.858 --> 01:33.858
Oh, they hung up.

01:33.859 --> 01:35.794
- Super freaky, huh?
- What?

01:35.795 --> 01:38.429
Linda was right about who was calling
and where Mort's wallet was.

01:38.464 --> 01:40.999
- Two predictions in a row.
- Try a third one, Mom.

01:41.033 --> 01:45.069
Okay. The next person to walk in
will be tall, dark and handsome.

01:45.070 --> 01:47.149
I...  I'm already here.

01:47.173 --> 01:48.406
Good one, Papa.

01:48.407 --> 01:49.440
- Thank you, son.
- You're welcome.

01:49.475 --> 01:50.642
I've heard of this before.

01:50.643 --> 01:53.044
Someone gets hit on their head
or gets struck by lightning,

01:53.045 --> 01:56.481
- and it unleashes psychic ability.
- Right. Right! Yeah!

01:56.482 --> 01:59.818
Everything was blurry for a second.
That's probably when it was unleashed.

01:59.819 --> 02:02.387
Like a dog,
when you take a leash off it.

02:02.421 --> 02:04.956
Uh... you guys are
kind of reaching here.

02:04.990 --> 02:06.925
No. I've always believed
in this sort of thing.

02:06.926 --> 02:09.360
Maybe this is happening to me
because I'm open to it.

02:09.360 --> 02:12.897
Nothing is happening to you, Lin,
because this sort of thing isn't real.

02:12.898 --> 02:14.632
It was just two small coincidences.

02:14.667 --> 02:16.401
- That's what I call my testicles.
- Gene.

02:16.402 --> 02:17.569
Hmm?

02:17.603 --> 02:20.405
Marshmallow in the house.
Now, put a burger in my mouth.

02:20.439 --> 02:21.539
Oh, hey, Marshmallow.

02:21.540 --> 02:25.143
- Tall, dark and handsome.
- That settles it, Mom's psychic.

02:25.177 --> 02:27.679
No, she isn't.
Marshmallow isn't handsome.

02:27.680 --> 02:28.880
She's... beautiful.

02:28.914 --> 02:29.848
Blush...

02:29.849 --> 02:31.416
Tomato, potato, Dad.

02:31.417 --> 02:33.118
Face it, Mom has powers.

02:33.119 --> 02:34.853
Promise me you'll use your
powers for good, Mom.

02:34.854 --> 02:35.820
Promise me!

02:35.855 --> 02:37.055
I promise. I promise.

02:37.089 --> 02:39.224
Linda's psychic.
What's your special power?

02:39.225 --> 02:41.092
I can crack anyone's back.

02:41.093 --> 02:42.060
Bob, come here.

02:42.094 --> 02:43.094
All right, just this once.

02:43.095 --> 02:44.164
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

02:44.196 --> 02:45.230
Right there.

02:45.231 --> 02:46.231
There you go. Yeah.
Ow...!

02:46.232 --> 02:47.298
Ow...!

02:47.299 --> 02:48.733
That's it. That's it.

02:48.734 --> 02:50.368
I'll lay you down on the floor now.

02:50.369 --> 02:51.536
Marshmallow, get off me.

02:51.537 --> 02:52.537
That's not helping.

02:52.538 --> 02:53.738
Oh, my God!

02:53.739 --> 02:55.106
That's a knot. That's all it is.

02:55.107 --> 02:56.374
I can't breathe.

02:57.743 --> 03:01.212
If Mom really is psychic, we're
gonna be on easy street.

03:01.213 --> 03:03.391
She can tell us the next
big trend in teen fashion.

03:03.416 --> 03:05.560
I'll bet it's butt hats.
Hats for your butt.

03:05.584 --> 03:08.319
No, guys. I mean,
we can finally cash in.

03:08.320 --> 03:10.688
But we got to figure out
if she's the real deal.

03:10.723 --> 03:12.234
Mom, what number am I thinking of?

03:12.258 --> 03:13.276
Not this again.

03:13.292 --> 03:14.559
Uh... four.

03:14.560 --> 03:15.560
No, nine.

03:15.561 --> 03:16.561
No-no-no, four.

03:16.562 --> 03:17.695
No. No. Nine.

03:17.730 --> 03:18.897
Is she right?
I don't know.

03:18.898 --> 03:20.031
Now that's all I can think of.

03:20.066 --> 03:22.100
That was it. That was it.
No. Tina, what number

03:22.101 --> 03:23.635
were you thinking of first?
I think that was.

03:23.669 --> 03:25.570
Uh... four or nine.

03:25.604 --> 03:26.638
No...!

03:26.639 --> 03:28.273
I see it burning in my brain.

03:28.274 --> 03:29.607
That doesn't prove anything.

03:29.642 --> 03:31.076
So, how <i> do</i> you predict things, Mom?

03:31.077 --> 03:32.777
How do you do it?!

03:32.778 --> 03:36.347
I kind of close my eyes, and, uh,
an image appears in my brain.

03:36.348 --> 03:38.083
That's called "having a thought," Lin.

03:38.084 --> 03:39.951
I don't expect you to understand, Bob.

03:39.952 --> 03:41.419
You'll never understand
the psychic realm.

03:41.420 --> 03:42.987
You know, I feel sorry for you.

03:43.022 --> 03:44.956
Let's settle this once and for all.

03:44.957 --> 03:46.291
Dad, you give her a test.

03:46.292 --> 03:49.127
Okay. If you're psychic,
you should be able to tell me

03:49.161 --> 03:50.328
what I'm putting in this bowl.

03:50.329 --> 03:51.830
Close your eyes.

03:51.831 --> 03:53.498
You really don't
have to make that sound.

03:53.499 --> 03:54.666
Yes, I do.

03:56.202 --> 03:57.602
Give me your hands, Bobby.

03:57.603 --> 03:59.537
Come on.
No.

03:59.538 --> 04:01.206
Give me your hands, I got to feel
them. Fine. If this... go ahead.

04:04.677 --> 04:05.710
It's an orange.

04:05.711 --> 04:07.278
It's an orange.
No...

04:07.279 --> 04:10.181
Amazing. Wow...
No. No. No, whoa. No, amazing.

04:10.182 --> 04:12.217
It's an orange.
Mom's a psychic!

04:12.218 --> 04:13.318
No, she's not!

04:13.352 --> 04:15.427
Yes, I am...!

04:20.696 --> 04:22.063
No. No. No.
I only make the sound.

04:22.064 --> 04:23.164
Don't make...
you don't make the sound.

04:23.165 --> 04:24.165
Oh. I'm sorry.

04:25.467 --> 04:27.735
I'm getting an image!
It's a "J."

04:27.736 --> 04:29.871
Do you have someone in your life
whose name begins with a "J"?

04:29.905 --> 04:31.706
Yes! My accountant Geoffrey!

04:31.740 --> 04:34.041
Aha!
Oh, but he spells it with a "G."

04:34.076 --> 04:35.710
Ah...
Oh! He's Jewish!

04:35.744 --> 04:37.512
Aha!
You nailed it!

04:37.513 --> 04:39.013
I'm meeting with him later today!

04:39.014 --> 04:40.214
That's right.

04:40.215 --> 04:41.215
Of course that's right.

04:41.216 --> 04:42.817
He just told you.
Yeah.

04:42.818 --> 04:44.352
Sounds like someone's
getting a tax refund.

04:44.353 --> 04:45.353
Whoa!

04:45.354 --> 04:46.387
All right, good reading.

04:46.388 --> 04:47.522
I'm gonna file this year!

04:47.556 --> 04:48.523
Do me. Do me. I'm next.

04:48.557 --> 04:50.024
Out of the way.
Okay. Okay.

04:50.025 --> 04:51.192
Mort, get out of the way.
Okay, easy.

04:51.226 --> 04:52.393
Give me your hands, Teddy.

04:52.394 --> 04:53.494
Ew, they're sticky.

04:56.765 --> 04:58.666
Mort, stop it!

04:58.667 --> 04:59.834
Mort, let her do the reading.

04:59.835 --> 05:01.803
I see a color.

05:01.837 --> 05:03.971
I... see a color.
It's your favorite color.

05:04.006 --> 05:06.474
Okay.
And it's a primary color.

05:06.508 --> 05:07.542
That's incredible.

05:07.576 --> 05:08.910
It's, uh...

05:08.911 --> 05:10.178
I'm picking up shades, uh... red.

05:10.212 --> 05:11.813
Nope.
Blue...

05:11.847 --> 05:13.247
No.
Blue...

05:13.282 --> 05:14.916
No.
Green...

05:14.950 --> 05:16.417
No.
Uh... yellow.

05:16.452 --> 05:18.719
Yes. Yellow. Wow.
Yeah!

05:18.720 --> 05:20.855
Yes, yes, yeah.
Wow. On the 17th try.

05:20.856 --> 05:21.856
She got it, though.

05:21.857 --> 05:23.124
She got it.

05:23.125 --> 05:24.892
Okay. Oh, I'm getting something else.

05:24.893 --> 05:26.027
Yellow something, uh...

05:26.028 --> 05:27.028
Yellow what?

05:28.597 --> 05:29.797
A ta... a taxi?

05:29.798 --> 05:30.865
No.
Is it a house?

05:30.866 --> 05:32.133
No.
Or a shirt?

05:32.134 --> 05:33.234
No...
Is it a dress?

05:33.268 --> 05:34.769
Yeah. Yeah.
It's a dress.

05:34.770 --> 05:36.237
I'm gonna meet a woman
in a yellow dress.

05:36.238 --> 05:37.405
Yeah!
Got it. What else?

05:37.406 --> 05:39.240
Uh... Th-Th-The change.

05:39.241 --> 05:40.708
What is it, Linda?
Lo... loose change.

05:40.709 --> 05:42.276
"Loose change"?
Yeah.

05:42.277 --> 05:44.512
You're gonna find a quarter.
No, it's a nickel.

05:44.546 --> 05:46.881
And... maybe that will change my life?
Yes.

05:46.882 --> 05:48.916
- No. No. No.
- Yep. I'm on a path now.

05:48.951 --> 05:51.452
Go meet a woman in a
yellow dress and find a nickel.

05:51.453 --> 05:53.254
It's not a scavenger hunt, Teddy.

05:53.255 --> 05:54.422
It is to me. Bye, everyone.

05:54.423 --> 05:56.057
Oh, I got to rest.

05:56.091 --> 05:58.960
Guys, I figured out how
we can use Mom's psychic brain

05:58.961 --> 06:00.261
to get us on the gravy train.

06:00.262 --> 06:01.796
So, what's the plan?

06:01.830 --> 06:04.398
It involves horses and money
and us getting some.

06:04.399 --> 06:05.666
Some horses?

06:05.667 --> 06:07.568
Some <i> money...</i>
Oh.

06:12.908 --> 06:14.242
Hey, kids, how was school?

06:14.276 --> 06:15.476
Boring.
Meh.

06:15.477 --> 06:17.011
Fun. I mean, whatever.

06:17.012 --> 06:18.045
What's going on here?

06:18.080 --> 06:19.881
Oh. Your mother has gone nuts.

06:22.484 --> 06:24.919
I see something, uh...

06:24.920 --> 06:27.188
it's bell-shaped. It's, uh...
Yeah?

06:27.189 --> 06:29.090
Maybe it's a bell?
Is it the Liberty Bell?

06:29.091 --> 06:30.458
That's what it is.
It's the Liberty Bell.

06:30.459 --> 06:31.726
It's the Liberty Bell.

06:31.760 --> 06:33.995
My ex-boyfriend lives in Philadelphia.

06:33.996 --> 06:35.496
Should I go there?
Should I get a cheesesteak?

06:35.531 --> 06:37.198
Gretchen! Go to him.

06:37.199 --> 06:39.100
I'm gonna do it!
I'm gonna do it!

06:39.134 --> 06:41.269
Go to him.
Wait till Philly sees my crack.

06:42.304 --> 06:43.304
Hi, Bob.

06:43.305 --> 06:44.305
Hi.
Bye...

06:44.306 --> 06:45.273
Stay away from trains!

06:45.307 --> 06:46.874
I'm gonna get a train ticket.

06:46.875 --> 06:48.209
Gretchen, come back!

06:48.210 --> 06:49.544
No. No. Well, maybe trains are fine.

06:49.545 --> 06:51.112
Well, that seemed to work out, Lin.

06:51.146 --> 06:52.346
Yeah. That was another good one.

06:52.347 --> 06:53.347
Another one down.

06:53.348 --> 06:55.983
Yeah. You just sent a woman, a
grown woman to another state,

06:55.984 --> 06:57.452
'cause you claim you're psychic.

06:57.453 --> 06:59.053
Yeah. Right.
Great.

06:59.054 --> 07:00.154
I believe in you, Mother.

07:00.155 --> 07:01.622
Thank you, Louise.

07:01.623 --> 07:03.958
You have a gift. It's gonna make
some people nervous.

07:03.959 --> 07:06.627
If this was 1980,
you'd be burned as a witch.

07:06.662 --> 07:09.664
Exactly. On a happier note,
which name do you like more:

07:09.665 --> 07:13.668
Sea Bagel, Pride of Detroit,
Mudbutt or Gelding the Lily?

07:13.669 --> 07:16.504
Lily.

07:16.505 --> 07:18.005
Go with the Lily one.

07:18.006 --> 07:20.007
What is this for?
Oh. We're renaming Tina.

07:20.008 --> 07:22.343
Oh! I'm glad I didn't choose Mudbutt.

07:22.344 --> 07:24.512
Okay, guys. Mom picked
a horse in tomorrow's race.

07:24.513 --> 07:26.848
Now all we need is
money to place a bet.

07:26.849 --> 07:29.250
You guys have money?
If you're asking me to sell my hair,

07:29.251 --> 07:30.585
the answer is no!

07:30.586 --> 07:32.320
Tina, what's left of your savings?

07:32.321 --> 07:33.755
$82.40.

07:33.756 --> 07:35.757
But, with interest,
it could be more than that.

07:35.758 --> 07:36.891
I haven't checked for a while.

07:36.892 --> 07:38.559
I want to be surprised when I look.

07:38.560 --> 07:41.162
Great! We'll put $82
on Gelding the Lily,

07:41.163 --> 07:42.930
collect our winnings
and split it three ways.

07:42.931 --> 07:45.199
Three ways? But
I'm putting up all the money.

07:45.200 --> 07:48.002
But it was my idea,
and Gene's your brother.

07:48.003 --> 07:49.537
Probably.

07:49.538 --> 07:52.106
And we'll spend the day
looking at horses!

07:52.107 --> 07:53.106
Let's do it.

07:55.411 --> 07:57.445
Order up, Lin.
Can you take this over?

07:57.446 --> 08:00.448
Shh. Not now, Bobby. I'm getting
something. Hold on. Oh, my God.

08:00.449 --> 08:02.417
This is weird. I'm feeling something.
No, you're not.

08:02.418 --> 08:04.085
Dizzy Dog, the beloved statue

08:04.086 --> 08:06.854
who's welcomed visitors to
Wonder Wharf for over 30 years,

08:06.855 --> 08:09.190
has been dognapped
from his familiar place

08:09.191 --> 08:11.693
at the end of the pier,
leaving police baffled.

08:11.694 --> 08:14.262
If you have any information on the
whereabouts of Dizzy Dog,

08:14.263 --> 08:15.863
please call in to our tip line.
Dizzy...

08:15.864 --> 08:19.200
Doggy. Hello? Tip line?
Seriously, Lin?

08:19.201 --> 08:20.902
Hi. Hello, tip line?

08:20.903 --> 08:22.870
Hold on, hold on.

08:22.905 --> 08:26.441
I have a tip. Are they confused
why Jerry Lewis is calling?

08:26.442 --> 08:29.610
I... You know, I see water.
Uh, Lin, stop. Hang up the phone.

08:29.645 --> 08:31.713
he's surrounded by water,
and I also see Do not do this.

08:31.747 --> 08:33.581
a foamy substance.
This is ridiculous. Stop.

08:33.582 --> 08:35.917
Bob, I'm on the phone.
And he's crying out.

08:35.918 --> 08:40.554
Dizzy Dog's crying out, "Help me. Lin, Help me.
Help me." hang up.

08:40.556 --> 08:42.222
<i>It was one thing when you were</i>

08:42.224 --> 08:44.058
just playing with Mort
and Teddy and Gretchen,

08:44.058 --> 08:46.227
but when you call in a tip
to the news, it's kind of

08:46.228 --> 08:48.062
taking things to another level, Lin.

08:48.063 --> 08:50.064
Why is it so hard
for you to believe, Bob?

08:50.065 --> 08:51.933
Because it's not possible, Lin.

08:51.967 --> 08:54.235
That's what Coach Blevins
said about me doing a sit-up,

08:54.236 --> 08:56.637
and now look.

08:56.638 --> 08:58.473
Yeah, Dad. Why can't
you just be supportive?

08:58.474 --> 09:00.308
Get Mom's back?
Yeah.

09:00.309 --> 09:03.077
Aw, forget it.
Tina, I'm not supporting this

09:03.078 --> 09:05.646
because it's irresponsible.
And not real.

09:05.647 --> 09:09.083
Oh, yeah? Well, I predict you
fall down a flight of stairs.

09:09.084 --> 09:11.486
Is that a threat?
No. It's a warning.

09:11.487 --> 09:13.121
Be very careful, that's all.

09:13.122 --> 09:17.191
Okay. Sounds good. Tripity
tripity, dibidy do. What? Look.

09:17.192 --> 09:18.993
Wonder Wharf's
own Dizzy Dog is home safe

09:18.994 --> 09:21.662
after apparently being knocked
off the pier into the ocean.

09:21.663 --> 09:24.098
Yay! Dizzy Dog is safe!
The discovery was made thanks

09:24.099 --> 09:26.467
to a tip from Linda Belcher,
local psychic.

09:26.502 --> 09:28.936
What?! Wow.
Ha! They found him in the water!

09:28.937 --> 09:31.939
All right, Mom! We always
believed you, Mom. Remember that?

09:31.940 --> 09:34.142
♪ I got power. ♪

09:35.511 --> 09:38.179
Will you pass that rag, Linda
Belcher, local psychic?

09:38.180 --> 09:40.314
I predict, yes.
Oh, my God.

09:40.349 --> 09:42.350
Dad, why can't you
just let Mom have this?

09:42.351 --> 09:45.186
Like I let Gene be the family
jokester. I could be that.

09:45.220 --> 09:46.654
So, Lin, I was just curious,

09:46.655 --> 09:48.890
when am I gonna fall
down that set of stairs?

09:48.891 --> 09:50.992
I haven't fallen down
a set of stairs yet.

09:51.026 --> 09:52.994
You're stealing her thunder again!

09:53.028 --> 09:55.296
So now you believe. No...

09:55.297 --> 09:57.298
But if I did, when would it happen?

09:57.299 --> 09:59.133
At fall-thirty.
What?

09:59.134 --> 10:00.535
See?
What?

10:00.536 --> 10:01.969
Sorry, Gene, you can say it.

10:01.970 --> 10:04.038
At fall-thirty.

10:04.073 --> 10:05.573
It's funnier when Gene says it.

10:05.574 --> 10:06.874
Yeah.

10:06.909 --> 10:08.142
Hello, Linda Belcher.

10:08.177 --> 10:09.844
Hey!
Sergeant Bosco!

10:09.845 --> 10:12.046
Apparently, you're some kind
of psychic?

10:12.081 --> 10:14.349
Yeah. Well, <i>some</i> people think so.

10:14.350 --> 10:15.750
Oh, my God.

10:15.751 --> 10:19.187
Well, you really came through
with that Dizzy Dog thing anyway.

10:19.188 --> 10:21.022
Oh, my God.

10:21.023 --> 10:22.690
I need your help with another case.

10:22.691 --> 10:24.425
A <i> real</i> case. This is the big time.

10:24.426 --> 10:25.693
Hit me with it.

10:25.694 --> 10:29.764
You're going to help me catch...
the Little Boy Bandit.

10:29.765 --> 10:32.200
The Little Boy
Bandit from the news.

10:32.201 --> 10:33.568
You've got to be kidding.

10:33.569 --> 10:35.570
Mom is a police psychic!

10:35.571 --> 10:37.470
Narc!
I gotta go lay down.

10:38.796 --> 10:41.265
So you want me to help you catch
the Little Boy Bandit?

10:41.266 --> 10:42.633
That's a big case.
It's huge.

10:42.634 --> 10:44.167
And I don't want your help, I need it.

10:44.168 --> 10:45.769
I'm desperate on this one.

10:45.803 --> 10:47.704
The Little Boy Bandit has
robbed eight businesses

10:47.705 --> 10:50.207
in the past month.
That makes me look bad.

10:50.208 --> 10:52.709
I'm not sure about using my
powers to catch a little boy.

10:52.710 --> 10:54.611
Like a fairy tale witch.

10:54.646 --> 10:57.614
No, we think he's a very small
man wearing kid's clothes,

10:57.615 --> 11:00.651
a wig stapled to his baseball cap,
and those roller shoes to get away.

11:00.652 --> 11:01.952
Blend into the crowd, you know?

11:01.986 --> 11:03.554
Sounds like Sandy Duncan.

11:03.555 --> 11:05.022
Everybody sounds like
Sandy Duncan to you, Mom!

11:05.023 --> 11:06.290
Sandy Duncan this,
Sandy Duncan that. Oh!

11:06.291 --> 11:07.825
Look, I'm under a lot

11:07.859 --> 11:10.127
of pressure to catch
this guy, and I got nothing!

11:10.161 --> 11:12.729
So you're open to the idea
of psychic abilities?

11:12.730 --> 11:15.999
In any other situation I'd say
no and laugh in your crazy face.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.868
But I'm out of leads.
You're my last hope.

11:17.869 --> 11:19.169
You're doomed.

11:19.170 --> 11:20.470
I'll help however I can, Sergeant.

11:20.471 --> 11:21.505
Great.
Let's roll.

11:21.506 --> 11:22.773
Bye, kids!

11:22.807 --> 11:24.308
Keep your father away from the stairs!

11:24.309 --> 11:26.243
Have Dad run up and down
the stairs. Got it!

11:28.379 --> 11:31.448
Your job is on the line
and you brought in a psychic?

11:31.482 --> 11:32.983
Yeah. She called the Dizzy Dog thing.

11:32.984 --> 11:35.986
If this doesn't work out, the captain's
gonna put you back on patrol.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.921
I'd miss you!
Don't worry about it.

11:37.922 --> 11:40.424
So, here are all the places
the Little Boy Bandit has hit.

11:40.425 --> 11:41.658
Mm...

11:41.659 --> 11:43.160
There seems to be no pattern,

11:43.161 --> 11:44.895
but maybe you'll get
a feeling or something.

11:44.929 --> 11:47.030
Huh, he seems to go after the stores

11:47.031 --> 11:49.566
that have little flags on 'em.

11:49.567 --> 11:52.169
Never mind. Let's just go touch
stuff in the evidence room.

11:52.170 --> 11:54.071
All of these items were handled

11:54.072 --> 11:56.640
by the Little Boy Bandit
during his various robberies.

11:56.641 --> 12:00.144
So grab something and see if
you get a reading or whatever.

12:00.145 --> 12:01.512
Wow! What was this used for?

12:01.513 --> 12:02.746
Put that down!
Hah.

12:02.747 --> 12:04.348
It's for a different case.

12:04.349 --> 12:06.350
Wha-ga-ning.
Okay, but you got the wrong guy.

12:06.351 --> 12:07.684
Really?
I think.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.119
Just kidding.
We know we got the wrong guy.

12:09.120 --> 12:10.387
Oh.

12:10.388 --> 12:11.688
Try this.
All right, let's see.

12:14.559 --> 12:16.426
Uh! Nothing's coming to me.

12:16.461 --> 12:18.629
Come on. Just do whatever
you did for the knife!

12:18.630 --> 12:20.464
Ticktock!
I'm still figuring out how this works!

12:20.465 --> 12:22.266
I don't know when it comes and goes.

12:22.300 --> 12:24.768
I hit my head the first time.
Maybe I need to get hit again?

12:24.803 --> 12:26.370
Okay.

12:26.371 --> 12:28.438
No, no, no, maybe I'm just
hungry or something.

12:28.439 --> 12:29.873
Fine.
Let's go get lunch.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.942
Ooh, do we get free hot dogs
from the carts?

12:31.943 --> 12:33.043
I do, you don't.

12:33.077 --> 12:34.645
Hi, kids.

12:34.646 --> 12:35.979
Hi, Teddy.

12:35.980 --> 12:37.447
Teddy, guys!

12:37.482 --> 12:39.483
This quest your mom sent me on
is exhausting.

12:39.484 --> 12:41.718
I haven't found a nickel
or any women in yellow dresses.

12:41.753 --> 12:43.720
But I did find this penny in a urinal!

12:43.721 --> 12:44.988
Ew.

12:44.989 --> 12:46.924
Ah, no!
My pee penny!

12:46.958 --> 12:48.692
So why'd you guys want
to meet me here?

12:48.726 --> 12:50.427
Our mom sent us on a quest, too.

12:50.428 --> 12:51.929
We're supposed to bet on a horse.

12:51.963 --> 12:53.597
Wow! That's much better
than finding a nickel.

12:53.598 --> 12:57.634
And we need our favorite Teddy
to place the bet for us.

12:57.635 --> 13:00.671
Hey, maybe you'll see a lady in a
yellow dress at the track, hmm?

13:00.672 --> 13:02.906
Or a horse in a yellow dress.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.341
At this point, I'd take either!

13:04.342 --> 13:05.993
So let's go gamble, huh, kids?

13:06.010 --> 13:10.164
Uh, need some more buns.

13:10.181 --> 13:13.084
<i>Tripity tripity, dibidy do.</i>

13:13.118 --> 13:15.486
Huh. Why don't we have a railing?

13:15.487 --> 13:18.088
Huh. Okay.

13:18.089 --> 13:19.423
Easy does it.

13:19.424 --> 13:20.657
Looking good.

13:20.658 --> 13:21.801
Halfway down.

13:23.328 --> 13:25.028
All right, Linda,
that's your fourth dog.

13:25.029 --> 13:26.296
Anything coming to you yet?

13:26.297 --> 13:28.065
Nah. Uh, not yet.

13:28.099 --> 13:30.167
Oh, wait, something's coming,
something's coming.

13:30.168 --> 13:32.687
Oh. It's just
a burp. I'm gassy.

13:32.704 --> 13:34.071
Come on, Linda, focus.
Sorry.

13:34.105 --> 13:36.740
Look, if I don't catch this guy,
my captain'll tear me a new one.

13:36.775 --> 13:38.308
Now take a look in that brain of yours

13:38.309 --> 13:39.810
and tell me where he's
gonna strike next.

13:39.811 --> 13:41.345
All right, give me a minute.

13:41.346 --> 13:43.680
Psychics didn't predict
Rome in a day, hold on.

13:43.681 --> 13:46.049
Ooh... Oh, I see a building.

13:46.050 --> 13:47.785
Good, keep going.
I see walls.

13:47.786 --> 13:49.153
Yeah.
Oh, and, uh, windows.

13:49.154 --> 13:51.221
All right.
You can see right out 'em.

13:51.222 --> 13:54.024
Yeah, I get it. There's, uh, oh,
there's something on the wall.

13:54.025 --> 13:56.026
Maybe pictures.
What are you talking about? Art?

13:56.027 --> 13:58.529
- Building with art?
-  I'm still gassy, uh...

13:58.530 --> 13:59.797
What about the Wharf Art Center?

13:59.798 --> 14:00.882
Is it the Wharf Art Center?

14:00.899 --> 14:03.367
War Farts?
Wharf Arts.

14:03.368 --> 14:05.502
They have a charity ball thing
going on there right now, today.

14:05.503 --> 14:06.904
Lots of wallets and
purses and jewelry.

14:06.905 --> 14:08.572
Let's roll. Let's go down there.

14:08.573 --> 14:11.842
I'm still eating my hot dog.
They have food at the thing.

14:15.380 --> 14:19.317
Tell Mom and Dad that I'll
miss them, but I'm home now.

14:19.350 --> 14:22.686
Oh, crap. Need tomatoes.

14:22.720 --> 14:24.555
Here we go.

14:24.556 --> 14:26.890
Wait a second.
I know how to do this.

14:26.925 --> 14:30.260
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

14:40.071 --> 14:42.039
You still feel good about this, Linda?

14:42.040 --> 14:44.675
I hope you do.
Yeah, it's beautiful.

14:44.676 --> 14:46.977
Not that crap,
your vision. Stop eating.

14:47.011 --> 14:48.412
My whole career is on the line.

14:48.413 --> 14:50.414
I have a lot of cops undercover here.

14:56.454 --> 14:59.123
I keep telling him to quit
the force and just play.

14:59.124 --> 15:01.225
♪ La, la, la, la, la. ♪

15:01.226 --> 15:04.394
All right, get out of here, you're
gonna blow our cover. Okay, okay.

15:04.395 --> 15:06.397
♪ La, la, la, la.
♪ Shush. Stop it.

15:08.066 --> 15:09.900
- I'm back.
- Oh, good.

15:09.934 --> 15:12.102
Nothing you told anyone
was remotely accurate,

15:12.103 --> 15:13.955
and now everyone is mad at you.

15:13.972 --> 15:15.606
What?
It's true, Linda.

15:15.607 --> 15:18.742
I went to Philadelphia last night
and I find out my ex-boyfriend

15:18.743 --> 15:20.043
is married and he's faithful.

15:20.044 --> 15:21.445
Thanks a lot.
Well...

15:21.446 --> 15:23.080
Yeah, and my meeting
with my accountant

15:23.081 --> 15:25.282
- was because I'm being audited.
- Aw.

15:25.283 --> 15:29.553
I dry cleaned my Speedo like you
said, and now it looks ridiculous.

15:29.554 --> 15:32.322
Yeah, and not only did I not
win the shrimp-eating contest,

15:32.323 --> 15:33.991
there was no shrimp-eating contest.

15:33.992 --> 15:35.977
And I owe the Shrimp Hut $200.

15:35.994 --> 15:36.994
Aw.
Yeah.

15:36.995 --> 15:39.296
And I have yet
to fall down any stairs.

15:39.297 --> 15:42.666
In fact, I've gone up and down
many sets of stairs.

15:42.667 --> 15:43.901
Just for fun, once.

15:43.935 --> 15:45.069
So you're not psychic.

15:45.103 --> 15:46.336
But I don't get it.

15:46.337 --> 15:48.405
I got all those
other predictions right.

15:48.406 --> 15:51.041
Or did I kind of
just use common sense?

15:51.076 --> 15:53.444
<i>I guess I saw Mort's
wallet falling out.</i>

15:53.445 --> 15:56.547
<i>And telemarketers call
around 3:00 every day.</i>

15:56.581 --> 15:58.958
<i>And I guess your hand
smelled like oranges.</i>

15:58.983 --> 16:01.836
Oh, God. I Kaiser-Soze'd myself.

16:01.853 --> 16:04.922
So you're saying you are not...

16:04.956 --> 16:06.724
I'm not psychic.

16:06.758 --> 16:08.459
Wow, who could have seen that coming?

16:08.460 --> 16:09.677
Just me, I guess.

16:09.694 --> 16:11.829
Oh, I'm sorry, everyone.

16:11.830 --> 16:14.131
I'm sorry. Don't throw...
Stop throwing things.

16:14.132 --> 16:15.799
I guess I got carried away.

16:15.800 --> 16:17.968
I let you all down.
You sure did.

16:17.969 --> 16:21.505
Well, at least no one got hurt.
Uh-oh. What?

16:21.506 --> 16:24.608
Bosco's in deep. Because of me,
he staked his whole career

16:24.609 --> 16:27.077
on the Little Boy Bandit robbing
the charity ball.

16:27.112 --> 16:28.612
Bob's Burgers.

16:28.613 --> 16:30.647
Bobby, it's me.
I'm at the track.

16:30.648 --> 16:32.216
Is Linda sure the dress is yellow?

16:32.217 --> 16:33.717
Well...
Could it be a floral pattern?

16:33.718 --> 16:35.452
And not a dress but a vest?

16:35.453 --> 16:37.488
Teddy. Teddy.
I think we're supposed to meet,

16:37.489 --> 16:39.957
but I'm not feeling any chemistry,
to be perfectly honest.

16:39.958 --> 16:41.959
Teddy. Teddy.
Nothing. Like, zero.

16:41.993 --> 16:43.160
Teddy.
W-What's up, Bob?

16:43.161 --> 16:44.661
Listen, shockingly, it turns out

16:44.662 --> 16:46.530
Linda's not psychic.
Oh.

16:46.531 --> 16:47.831
Yeah.
Oh. That's actually a relief.

16:47.832 --> 16:49.233
I was terrible at her predictions.

16:49.234 --> 16:50.467
But, boy, the kids
are gonna be crushed.

16:50.468 --> 16:52.036
Why?

16:52.037 --> 16:54.104
They put all their money
on that horse Linda picked.

16:54.139 --> 16:55.139
Wait, where are the kids?

16:55.173 --> 16:56.507
They're with me at the track.
What?

16:56.508 --> 16:57.641
You didn't know, Bobby?

16:57.642 --> 16:58.876
No.
You really should keep

16:58.877 --> 17:00.144
a better eye on your kids, Bobby.

17:00.145 --> 17:01.245
You know, they could end up anywhere.

17:01.246 --> 17:03.814
In this case, they're safely
with me at the track.

17:03.815 --> 17:05.648
Nothing to worry about.
Tina, don't touch that.

17:05.650 --> 17:08.252
Louise, get off of the track,
the horses are racing.

17:08.252 --> 17:10.854
I'd better go. Bye, Bob.
Teddy? Teddy?

17:10.855 --> 17:12.589
Okay, you go tell Bosco
you're not psychic.

17:12.589 --> 17:16.026
I have to go pick up the kids from
the track, where you sent them.

17:16.027 --> 17:17.560
Aw, nuts.

17:18.863 --> 17:21.415
Bosco. Bosco.

17:21.433 --> 17:22.965
What? What are you doing here?

17:23.001 --> 17:24.542
I got bad news.

17:24.569 --> 17:27.738
I guess, uh... I guess
I'm not a psychic after all.

17:27.739 --> 17:29.340
A real psychic. Amateur.

17:29.374 --> 17:32.593
What?
Well, uh, yeah, uh, sorry.

17:32.610 --> 17:34.679
Listen, I've put everything
on the line here,

17:34.713 --> 17:36.847
because you said you were psychic.

17:36.848 --> 17:39.350
So you better get psychic and fast.

17:39.351 --> 17:41.051
I'm arresting <i>somebody</i> tonight.

17:41.052 --> 17:42.686
Who you gonna arrest?
You.

17:42.687 --> 17:43.787
Me?
Yes.

17:43.788 --> 17:45.522
For what? Eating too many hot dogs?

17:45.523 --> 17:47.024
Impersonating a psychic.

17:47.058 --> 17:48.859
Oh. Ooh.

17:50.919 --> 17:52.487
Hey, look.
That's Gelding the Lily.

17:52.488 --> 17:53.721
Our race is next.

17:53.756 --> 17:55.023
I want to get his autograph.

17:55.024 --> 17:56.424
Kids. There you are.

17:56.425 --> 17:58.026
And Teddy.
Teddy's here, too, Bobby.

17:58.027 --> 17:59.694
Hi, Teddy. Come on,
everyone, let's go.

17:59.695 --> 18:01.414
No, no, no, no, no.
But our race is next.

18:01.430 --> 18:03.031
We already placed our bet.

18:03.032 --> 18:05.166
And Tina is getting an
autograph from a horse.

18:05.200 --> 18:08.202
He's not great at holding a pen.
Then can you sign it as him?

18:08.237 --> 18:10.738
Ugh, fine. You just have to
put the pen in your mouth.

18:10.739 --> 18:12.373
Uh, I kind of don't have all day.

18:12.374 --> 18:13.574
Here, like this.

18:13.575 --> 18:15.176
Just like you're a horse.

18:15.177 --> 18:18.212
Like how a horse would s...
would sign an autograph.

18:18.213 --> 18:21.015
See? Oh, you dropped your wig.
Uh, thanks.

18:21.016 --> 18:22.950
What's that for?
I am a...

18:22.951 --> 18:24.185
birthday clown.

18:24.219 --> 18:25.553
I got a thing after the race.

18:25.554 --> 18:27.355
Oops. You dropped your roller shoe.

18:27.356 --> 18:30.091
What's this for? It is...
for my clowning.

18:30.125 --> 18:32.327
I'm a roller skate clown jockey guy.

18:32.361 --> 18:33.761
Wow, triple threat.

18:33.796 --> 18:35.997
Oh, my God.
He's the Little Boy Bandit.

18:36.031 --> 18:38.099
What did you say?
Me? Nothing.

18:38.100 --> 18:39.334
Uh, have a great race.

18:39.368 --> 18:40.401
Oh, thanks.

18:40.436 --> 18:41.569
W-What?
I said thanks.

18:41.570 --> 18:42.603
Did you say thanks?

18:42.604 --> 18:43.738
Oh, sorry, you go.

18:43.739 --> 18:45.440
Thank you.
No problem.

18:46.942 --> 18:49.210
I predict this is my husband.

18:49.211 --> 18:51.746
Just kidding, I knew it was.
Caller ID, sorry.

18:51.780 --> 18:53.581
Hello?
Linda. He's here.

18:53.582 --> 18:55.483
The Little Boy Bandit is at the track.

18:55.484 --> 18:57.218
He's a jockey.
What?

18:57.219 --> 18:59.320
His race is about
to begin. Tell Bosco.

18:59.321 --> 19:00.955
Get him here as soon as you can.

19:00.990 --> 19:02.790
Bosco. Good news.

19:02.791 --> 19:04.258
Bobby
just called and said...

19:09.164 --> 19:10.965
Let's go, Gelding the Lily. He'd run

19:11.000 --> 19:13.167
so much faster without metal shoes.

19:13.168 --> 19:16.004
And they're in the home stretch.

19:16.005 --> 19:17.939
Gelding the Lily is pulling away.

19:17.973 --> 19:20.608
Come on. Come on!

19:20.643 --> 19:21.976
He's actually gonna win.

19:21.977 --> 19:25.246
Go!

19:26.749 --> 19:28.516
No, no, no, no,

19:28.517 --> 19:31.252
no, no! We would have won.

19:31.286 --> 19:34.422
I think I'm gonna have my next
birthday party here at the track.

19:34.423 --> 19:35.957
<i>So the Little Boy Bandit</i>

19:35.991 --> 19:38.426
will be riding off into
the sunset, to jail.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.328
I'm here with arresting officer
Sergeant Bosco.

19:40.329 --> 19:42.530
if you commit a crime

19:42.531 --> 19:45.266
and you're under five feet
tall, Bosco will catch you.

19:45.267 --> 19:48.136
I did have some help, though,
from a friend.

19:48.137 --> 19:50.505
My gun. And his friend, my other gun.

19:50.539 --> 19:51.706
- Oh.
- When's this gonna air?

19:51.707 --> 19:52.707
We're live.
Well,

19:52.708 --> 19:53.708
I'm just happy that

19:53.709 --> 19:55.310
we can all agree now

19:55.311 --> 19:58.313
there is definitely no such
thing as psychic powers.

19:58.314 --> 20:00.214
Oh, I still believe, Bob.
What?

20:00.215 --> 20:03.785
Yeah. I may not have psychic powers
myself, but I know they exist.

20:03.819 --> 20:05.653
After everything that's happened, Lin.

20:05.688 --> 20:08.222
Yes, Bob. I have faith in
the unknown and you don't.

20:08.223 --> 20:10.558
If I had to do it all
over again, I would.

20:10.559 --> 20:13.528
Who knows? You got to stay open
to this stuff.

20:13.562 --> 20:15.663
Lin, you almost cost a man his job.

20:15.698 --> 20:18.843
But in a way, Mom helped Bosco
catch the Little Boy Bandit.

20:18.867 --> 20:21.469
No, she didn't. We saw him
and then called her.

20:21.503 --> 20:23.838
But if Mom hadn't thought
she was psychic, we never would have

20:23.839 --> 20:25.891
gone to the track in the first place.
Yeah, Dad.

20:25.908 --> 20:28.076
- See, Bob?
-  You're all nuts.

20:28.077 --> 20:31.512
There is no such thi...
 Ow. Oh.

20:31.547 --> 20:33.081
Bob?
Yup?

20:33.082 --> 20:34.582
You all right?
Yeah.

20:34.583 --> 20:37.418
Did you just fall?
No. I did not fall.

20:37.419 --> 20:39.520
Okay.
I walked down the stairs.

20:39.521 --> 20:41.422
Walked down the stairs really fast.

20:41.423 --> 20:43.191
I thought I just heard a fall.

20:43.192 --> 20:44.826
G-Gene.
Yeah?

20:44.827 --> 20:46.494
Will you come down here for a sec?

20:46.495 --> 20:47.495
Sure, I'd love to.

20:47.496 --> 20:48.763
She <i> is</i> psychic.

20:48.764 --> 20:51.199
She is a witch.
Burn her!

20:53.502 --> 20:55.169
Nothing's coming to me.
