04:41.207 --> 04:43.340
Hey! Leave it.

04:43.342 --> 04:45.477
Leave it. Leave it.

09:45.077 --> 09:47.446
Who's there?

10:23.983 --> 10:25.384
Cookie.

10:26.818 --> 10:31.288
I want some of that
buffalo steak for breakfast,

10:31.290 --> 10:33.390
the fried cakes.

10:33.392 --> 10:36.526
Finished all that back
at Colter's Hell.

10:36.528 --> 10:39.131
How about that soda bread?

10:41.833 --> 10:44.469
There's none of that
left either, I'm afraid.

10:46.204 --> 10:48.705
You find anything
out there tonight?

10:48.707 --> 10:51.908
Uh, mushrooms,

10:51.910 --> 10:53.745
digger squirrel.

10:56.515 --> 11:00.350
I had the squirrel,
but it got away.

11:00.352 --> 11:02.152
Well, what's in the larder?

11:02.154 --> 11:05.789
10 dry biscuits,
some jerky, salt.

11:05.791 --> 11:07.125
Nothing else?

11:08.827 --> 11:10.794
No.

11:10.796 --> 11:13.832
It's the Cookie's job
to improvise.

11:15.534 --> 11:19.569
This is a land of abundance,
Mr. Figowitz,

11:19.571 --> 11:21.905
and you are charged
with finding our vittles

11:21.907 --> 11:23.640
until we reach Fort Tillikum.

11:23.642 --> 11:26.376
- Hold up there, mister.
- You understand that, I'm sure.

11:26.378 --> 11:29.379
Share the wealth!

11:29.381 --> 11:31.850
He's drinking more
than his share!

11:37.456 --> 11:39.422
Ah, damn it! That's wasting it.

11:39.424 --> 11:42.694
Hey!

11:53.672 --> 11:55.271
Sons of bitches!

13:17.789 --> 13:18.924
Hello?

13:21.760 --> 13:23.961
You all right?

13:23.963 --> 13:25.363
Hungry.

13:30.302 --> 13:33.805
Your cook has retired
for the night?

13:37.275 --> 13:40.910
I don't think so.

13:40.912 --> 13:43.582
You could call him here
for a moment.

13:49.921 --> 13:52.789
I'm the cook.

13:52.791 --> 13:53.993
I see.

13:57.329 --> 14:02.233
I've been walking
for a long time.

14:02.235 --> 14:04.536
I might stay here awhile.

14:14.180 --> 14:15.680
Wait.

15:42.068 --> 15:46.237
You speak good English

15:46.239 --> 15:47.940
for an Indian.

15:52.777 --> 15:56.512
Uh, I'm not Indian.

15:56.514 --> 15:57.883
I'm Chinese.

16:01.053 --> 16:05.521
I didn't know there were
Chinese in these parts.

16:05.523 --> 16:07.590
Everyone is here.

16:07.592 --> 16:09.494
We all want that soft gold.

16:11.630 --> 16:13.865
That's why you're here,
isn't it?

16:17.469 --> 16:19.537
Trapped our share.

16:30.049 --> 16:31.449
What's your name?

16:34.086 --> 16:36.186
King-Lu.

16:36.188 --> 16:38.488
That's what they call me.

16:38.490 --> 16:41.160
- You?
- Otis Figowitz.

16:44.462 --> 16:46.729
They call me Cookie.

16:46.731 --> 16:48.500
Good to meet you.

16:54.572 --> 16:58.976
There are, uh, some men
chasing me,

16:58.978 --> 17:00.543
Russians.

17:00.545 --> 17:02.148
Have you seen them?

17:11.290 --> 17:13.958
Why are men chasing you?

17:13.960 --> 17:21.464
I... might have killed
one of their friends.

17:21.465 --> 17:27.304
Chenamus, my friend.

17:27.306 --> 17:30.606
They called him a thief,

17:30.608 --> 17:33.710
and then gutted him
from neck to loin.

17:33.712 --> 17:35.645
I had a pistol.

17:35.647 --> 17:40.483
I took a shot.
I got one in the neck,

17:40.485 --> 17:43.920
and he came after me,

17:43.922 --> 17:46.192
and I ran.

17:49.295 --> 17:52.562
What happened to your clothes?

17:52.564 --> 17:55.466
I stuffed them
into hollow trees,

17:55.468 --> 17:59.704
threw my gun
in a creek and, uh...

18:05.344 --> 18:08.145
Come on.

18:08.147 --> 18:10.282
You can sleep here.

19:31.763 --> 19:33.830
When we find that whore son,

19:33.832 --> 19:39.536
he'll never set foot
in this shit forest.

19:39.538 --> 19:43.706
Okay, so what I'm hearing,
there's about two days...

19:43.708 --> 19:45.842
At the most. At the most.

19:45.844 --> 19:49.413
Midday? No.

19:49.415 --> 19:55.121
It was then after midday
when we get there.

19:57.689 --> 20:00.090
Move out! We got directions.

20:00.092 --> 20:04.827
North and west to Fort Tillikum,

20:04.829 --> 20:07.598
about two days journey.

20:07.600 --> 20:11.101
Hit the river, head downstream,

20:11.103 --> 20:14.505
downriver at every branch.

20:14.507 --> 20:16.039
Oh...

20:16.041 --> 20:17.407
and there's a murderer
in the woods,

20:17.409 --> 20:18.944
so stay close.

20:46.539 --> 20:49.672
The Russians said the elk
are gone this time of year.

20:49.674 --> 20:51.408
And what else
did that Russian say?

20:51.410 --> 20:53.477
Said the company is paying
three silver ingots

20:53.479 --> 20:56.748
for every beaver pelt,
two copper for every muskrat.

21:00.219 --> 21:02.718
And there's beer at the fort.

21:02.720 --> 21:05.556
And other things.

21:05.558 --> 21:08.691
- And women?
- More than one.

21:18.537 --> 21:21.737
Keep on down the river
from here one more day.

21:21.739 --> 21:24.408
Hungry as hell.

21:24.410 --> 21:25.943
Cookie, find me some food.

21:25.945 --> 21:28.478
Eat your damn hand.
We'll be there tomorrow.

21:28.480 --> 21:30.280
I want food tonight,

21:30.282 --> 21:33.816
or I'm taking it out
on this one.

21:33.818 --> 21:36.687
I'm sick of looking at this one.

21:36.689 --> 21:39.189
Can't wait to be done with him.

21:39.191 --> 21:42.459
Can't wait
to never see him again.

21:42.461 --> 21:45.996
When you get
your cut at the fort,

21:45.998 --> 21:50.200
I'll be waiting for you
outside the gates,

21:50.202 --> 21:53.604
waiting for you
with your sack full of silver.

21:53.606 --> 21:56.306
- Leave him alone!
- No. No!

27:06.285 --> 27:08.186
Fancy boots, lad.

27:13.625 --> 27:16.126
Fancy boots.

27:26.905 --> 27:32.844
He said she'd be there
in about... in 6 months.

27:36.114 --> 27:39.616
How much do you want for this?

27:39.618 --> 27:40.750
This?

27:40.752 --> 27:46.156
- It's a deal.
- Oysters!

27:46.158 --> 27:49.759
Clams! Oysters! Clams!

27:53.465 --> 27:57.200
Five twists, six twists,
half off.

27:57.202 --> 27:58.234
Those look like
Jean-Baptiste's boots!

27:58.236 --> 28:02.205
I think...

28:02.207 --> 28:04.041
I like how it looks.
That's all.

28:04.043 --> 28:06.876
- You like a flare.
- I believe.

29:06.438 --> 29:09.205
Five twists, six twists,
half off.

29:09.207 --> 29:10.840
Six twists, half off.

29:10.842 --> 29:14.479
Six twists, six twists.

30:37.629 --> 30:39.997
Flowers... the flowers
are different shaped.

30:39.999 --> 30:44.034
- Maybe it was bodies.
- Still clusters

30:44.036 --> 30:46.903
I'm telling you, it was up
somewhere on Snake River.

30:46.905 --> 30:50.007
- Don't know nothing.
- That's true.

30:50.009 --> 30:51.875
- Your body knows more than your brain.
- Hold tight.

30:51.877 --> 30:53.409
Then they start
hitting each other in the head.

30:53.411 --> 30:55.278
I'm getting to that.

30:55.280 --> 30:57.181
Then, they start hitting
each other

30:57.183 --> 31:00.117
- with.
- Got the whole ship?

31:00.119 --> 31:02.119
- We got two on the ship.
- No blocking.

31:02.121 --> 31:04.155
He was under Ruby.
Lived as a slave up there

31:04.157 --> 31:05.755
for 3 years before he got free.

31:05.757 --> 31:07.191
How was it, being a slave?

31:07.193 --> 31:08.892
He didn't like it.

31:19.172 --> 31:20.839
Uh, whiskey please.

31:25.178 --> 31:27.079
- How much?
- Two.

31:36.421 --> 31:38.888
You know what
it's like in there.

31:38.890 --> 31:40.423
No way of knowing.

31:43.728 --> 31:45.831
That's what I saw.

31:48.968 --> 31:50.700
I'm telling you,
it's the first one,

31:50.702 --> 31:52.972
first cow in the Territory.

31:54.941 --> 31:59.310
Shipped it all the way up
to Saint Francisco.

31:59.312 --> 32:02.712
Saint Luis Obispo.

32:02.714 --> 32:06.083
I heard Saint Francisco.

32:06.085 --> 32:09.419
I spoke to the ferryman,

32:09.421 --> 32:12.022
and he was the one
bringing the cow.

32:12.024 --> 32:15.192
You need to ask
the Chief Factor about that.

32:15.194 --> 32:18.595
Chief Factor ordered
two cows and a calf,

32:18.597 --> 32:20.396
and that's a true story,

32:20.398 --> 32:22.866
but the other ones
died on the way.

32:22.868 --> 32:24.634
What good is one cow
to anyone?

32:24.636 --> 32:26.603
Cow needs a stud.

32:26.605 --> 32:30.307
Chief Factor wants milk
in his tea

32:30.309 --> 32:32.076
like a proper English gentleman.

32:32.078 --> 32:34.477
Like a proper lady.

32:39.352 --> 32:41.484
This ain't a place for cows.

32:41.486 --> 32:43.753
God would have put cows here
if it was.

32:43.755 --> 32:48.691
Ah, it's no place for
white men either then, huh?

32:48.693 --> 32:50.894
Well, look who's here.

32:50.896 --> 32:53.763
Brilliant William!

32:53.765 --> 32:55.832
I need a few sunbeams, William.

32:55.834 --> 32:58.168
Can you gather me up
a dozen sunbeams?

32:58.170 --> 33:00.703
They're on the ground
just laying around everywhere.

33:00.705 --> 33:03.406
- Any old beams will do.
- I'll have a beer.

33:03.408 --> 33:05.242
Here's a question.

33:05.244 --> 33:07.744
What does a tongue taste like?

33:07.746 --> 33:09.679
Do you ever think about that?

33:09.681 --> 33:11.848
I bet you have
some distinct opinions

33:11.850 --> 33:13.716
about what <i>your</i> tongue
tastes like.

33:13.718 --> 33:15.352
Am I right, William?

33:15.354 --> 33:16.786
Oh, traders all...

33:16.788 --> 33:18.588
Whatcha saying there,
Brilliant William?

33:18.590 --> 33:20.490
Something brilliant ain't bad.

33:20.492 --> 33:22.960
He's always good
for some clever opinions.

33:22.962 --> 33:26.529
What's the difference
between a river and a lake?

33:26.531 --> 33:28.065
You figure that one out yet?

33:28.067 --> 33:29.599
Willy?

33:29.601 --> 33:31.001
I'm not bothering him.

33:31.003 --> 33:33.137
I'm just asking him
an honest question.

33:33.139 --> 33:35.638
What about the chicken
and the egg?

33:35.640 --> 33:37.473
He knew for sure
it was a chicken

33:37.475 --> 33:40.576
until he thought about it
from the egg's point of view.

33:40.578 --> 33:42.947
That one really hurt
your old noggin.

33:42.949 --> 33:44.547
Didn't it, William?

33:44.549 --> 33:46.649
Yep. Yep.
I think that's how you got

33:46.651 --> 33:48.618
this crack in your brain bone.

33:51.823 --> 33:56.293
Willy, better do something,
or your head is going to blow.

33:56.295 --> 33:59.898
You, watch him 'til I'm done.

34:06.838 --> 34:09.774
Make some proper money, eh?

34:28.860 --> 34:32.664
Coo, coo.

34:36.501 --> 34:38.735
Coo, coo, coo.

34:38.737 --> 34:43.007
Coo. Coo, coo, coo.

34:43.009 --> 34:46.012
Hello, Cookie.

34:47.746 --> 34:50.246
Thought I might find you
here sooner or later.

34:52.118 --> 34:55.119
I never thought
I'd ever see you again.

34:55.121 --> 34:57.454
I was lucky.

34:57.456 --> 35:00.723
Those, uh, Russian villains,

35:00.725 --> 35:04.560
they left the country
just after I left you.

35:08.767 --> 35:10.800
Well, here I am,

35:10.802 --> 35:13.571
free and easy,
right back where I was.

35:21.280 --> 35:24.348
Uh, where are
all your kind friends?

35:24.350 --> 35:30.187
Oh, they mostly went south,
some north.

35:30.189 --> 35:32.622
But not you.

35:32.624 --> 35:34.557
Not yet.

35:34.559 --> 35:36.095
No one would have me.

35:38.230 --> 35:42.032
And, uh, where are you
staying in the meantime?

35:42.034 --> 35:46.769
I got a tent a mile that way,

35:46.771 --> 35:49.106
uh, other side of the hill.

35:49.108 --> 35:53.910
I've got a place
a mile thataway.

35:53.912 --> 35:57.448
Mm, I've got
a bottle there, too.

35:57.450 --> 35:59.950
Mm-hmm.

35:59.952 --> 36:04.256
Maybe you'd, uh,
like to come help me drink it.

36:05.690 --> 36:08.891
Uh, of course, I would, but...

36:08.893 --> 36:11.361
Oh. Well, leave him.

36:11.363 --> 36:13.030
He's fine.

36:16.535 --> 36:19.802
He's fine.

36:19.804 --> 36:24.607
Well, you wait here.

36:24.609 --> 36:26.577
All right?

36:26.579 --> 36:29.381
Your daddy will be back soon.

36:40.926 --> 36:44.894
- Damn it, James!
- Well, I put it there.

36:44.896 --> 36:48.265
I've been in these parts
close to two years now.

36:48.267 --> 36:50.000
I've thought about leaving
more than once,

36:50.002 --> 36:54.071
but I sense opportunity here.

36:54.073 --> 36:56.906
Ships coming in
and out every week.

36:56.908 --> 36:58.674
More raw materials
than anywhere I've seen,

36:58.676 --> 37:01.080
and I've been all over.

37:15.827 --> 37:17.396
You've been everywhere.

37:20.499 --> 37:24.935
I caught my first trade ship
to Canton when I was nine.

37:24.937 --> 37:27.538
From there, I sailed to London,

37:27.540 --> 37:30.840
Africa, saw the pyramids.

37:30.842 --> 37:34.413
This is a land of riches,
I tell you.

37:40.419 --> 37:44.854
I see something in this land
I haven't seen before.

37:44.856 --> 37:47.790
Pretty much everywhere
has been touched by now.

37:47.792 --> 37:51.662
But this is still new,

37:51.664 --> 37:53.729
more nameless things around here

37:53.731 --> 37:55.800
than you can shake an eel at.

38:01.040 --> 38:05.309
Doesn't seem new to me,
seems old.

38:05.311 --> 38:06.911
Mm.

38:19.525 --> 38:26.365
Everything is old
if you look at it that way.

38:31.537 --> 38:36.540
History isn't here yet.

38:36.542 --> 38:41.080
It's coming, but we got here
early this time.

38:44.782 --> 38:51.856
Maybe this time,
we can be ready for it.

38:53.158 --> 38:56.295
We can take it on our own terms.

39:12.278 --> 39:16.115
It's not much to look at,
I know.

39:47.079 --> 39:50.549
Here's to... something.

40:08.033 --> 40:11.003
You make yourself easy.
I'll get a fire going.

43:03.342 --> 43:05.377
Looks better already.

43:07.779 --> 43:10.115
Relax. Sit. Sit.

43:45.217 --> 43:47.653
Where are you from, Cookie?

43:50.589 --> 43:52.289
Maryland.

43:52.291 --> 43:57.527
- Hm, never been.
- Hmm...

43:57.529 --> 43:59.396
It's fine.

43:59.398 --> 44:01.498
I don't remember it much.

44:01.500 --> 44:03.468
Not fine enough to stay, huh?

44:09.341 --> 44:12.043
My mother died
when I was born,

44:12.045 --> 44:14.946
and then my father died.

44:14.948 --> 44:17.514
I had to move on to find work.

44:17.516 --> 44:21.153
Well... I never stopped moving.

44:48.714 --> 44:51.381
I had an idea once.
Furs are one thing,

44:51.383 --> 44:53.450
but there's a precious oil
in the beavers, too.

44:53.452 --> 44:55.352
That's worth something in China.

44:55.354 --> 44:58.055
They use it for medicine
over there.

44:58.057 --> 45:01.324
If a man could take a batch
of that precious beaver oil

45:01.326 --> 45:05.364
on a ship to Canton,
he could make his fortune.

45:08.200 --> 45:09.735
Why don't you?

45:12.871 --> 45:15.505
Eh, oil is in the glands.

45:15.507 --> 45:17.975
Glands never make it back
to the fort,

45:17.977 --> 45:21.578
just rot away in the woods.

45:21.580 --> 45:26.249
Anyway, I don't have
contacts in Canton.

45:26.251 --> 45:27.484
I'm from the north.

45:27.486 --> 45:29.552
They hate a Northerner there.

45:29.554 --> 45:32.324
Worse than a white man to them.

45:37.329 --> 45:40.497
What I'd really like is a farm.

45:44.603 --> 45:50.173
Land south of here is wide-open.

45:50.175 --> 45:52.277
The world wants filberts.

45:57.849 --> 45:59.317
Or walnuts.

46:03.889 --> 46:05.624
Or almonds.

46:12.197 --> 46:18.368
Something you can
pick up and send,

46:18.370 --> 46:21.304
but you can't just grow a tree.

46:21.306 --> 46:22.841
It takes time.

46:31.683 --> 46:35.585
It's the getting started
that's the puzzle.

46:35.587 --> 46:39.056
No way for a poor man to start.

46:39.058 --> 46:42.258
You need capital,

46:42.260 --> 46:44.294
or you need
some kind of miracle.

46:44.296 --> 46:46.197
You need leverage.

46:50.402 --> 46:52.404
Or a crime.

46:58.877 --> 47:05.915
I'd like to open
a hotel someday,

47:05.917 --> 47:10.353
a place for travelers.

47:10.355 --> 47:11.890
Or a bakery.

47:19.431 --> 47:21.399
That's nice.

47:27.272 --> 47:32.442
A hotel and a bakery,

47:32.444 --> 47:35.645
with wild-huckleberry pies.

47:35.647 --> 47:39.183
You could do that here.

47:39.185 --> 47:42.354
Someplace warmer.

48:02.674 --> 48:05.943
It has holes in it,

48:05.945 --> 48:09.646
and it looks like
the face of a man.

48:09.648 --> 48:12.649
It's just one black rock.

48:12.651 --> 48:15.485
That's a weather stone.

48:15.487 --> 48:18.956
It makes rain, they say.

48:18.958 --> 48:22.625
They say it was
a powerful spirit once

48:22.627 --> 48:26.197
and got turned into stone.

48:26.199 --> 48:29.801
If anyone sits on it, it rains.

48:32.671 --> 48:34.939
You really believe in that?

48:34.941 --> 48:37.409
Uh... eh.

48:40.645 --> 48:43.849
I believe different things
in different places.

50:21.280 --> 50:24.281
Saw a cow today.

50:24.283 --> 50:28.319
Hm.

50:28.321 --> 50:34.024
It wasn't far from
Chief Factor's house.

50:34.026 --> 50:37.196
- In a meadow.
- Hm.

50:44.437 --> 50:50.606
- I'd like some of that milk.
- I-I'm not a milk drinker.

50:50.608 --> 50:54.577
It doesn't agree with me.

50:54.579 --> 50:58.648
I wouldn't drink it.

50:58.650 --> 51:05.688
I'd use it for cookies.

51:05.690 --> 51:09.826
Or scones.

51:09.828 --> 51:12.064
Nothing better
than buttermilk biscuits.

51:16.868 --> 51:21.806
I'm tired of
this flour-and-water bread.

51:41.793 --> 51:45.661
What else do you need
to make good biscuits, Cookie?

51:45.663 --> 51:50.234
Oh, flour, some sugar,

51:50.236 --> 51:56.008
salt, baking soda.

52:06.684 --> 52:10.187
How long does it take
to milk a cow?

52:10.189 --> 52:12.855
Not long.

52:12.857 --> 52:16.726
- Make much noise?
- No.

52:16.728 --> 52:21.131
Can cows give milk at night?

52:21.133 --> 52:25.137
As long as she wasn't milked
after dinner.

53:50.222 --> 53:54.558
I'll go up and keep an eye
on things from here.

53:54.560 --> 53:56.128
Give me a lift.

54:06.305 --> 54:09.739
If I see anything,
I'll, uh, give a call.

54:09.741 --> 54:13.343
- All right.
- I'll do an owl.

54:13.345 --> 54:15.512
I don't think
you can get up there.

54:43.642 --> 54:46.243
Hello.

54:46.245 --> 54:49.379
How are you?

54:49.381 --> 54:52.884
Didn't expect company
this late at night, did you?

54:56.956 --> 55:00.324
Well, here we are.

55:16.808 --> 55:18.776
Sorry about your husband.

55:22.214 --> 55:26.984
I heard he didn't make it
all the way.

55:26.986 --> 55:32.155
And your calf...

55:32.157 --> 55:39.198
it's a terrible thing. Terrible.

55:44.436 --> 55:51.008
But you got a nice place here.
You do.

55:51.010 --> 55:54.480
You got a real nice
little place here, don't you?

58:26.064 --> 58:27.731
How much do you think
someone would pay

58:27.733 --> 58:29.401
for a biscuit like that?

58:32.037 --> 58:34.039
I wish we had some honey.

58:39.044 --> 58:42.145
A glass of whiskey
is two silver coins.

58:42.147 --> 58:45.715
A pickle is three.

58:45.717 --> 58:47.250
Men work out in the fort,

58:47.252 --> 58:50.556
loaded with silver and shells
and company script.

58:55.694 --> 58:59.095
I once saw a man spend
five good beaver pelts

58:59.097 --> 59:01.133
on a broken fork.

59:12.644 --> 59:15.545
I think we should
test the waters.

59:15.547 --> 59:20.116
Next batch, Cookie,
we'll take to market.

59:20.118 --> 59:22.954
I've heard a fortune
is made on this.

59:22.956 --> 59:24.623
That seems dangerous.

59:27.292 --> 59:29.528
So is anything worth doing.

59:34.099 --> 59:36.401
I think they'd like
something sweeter.

01:00:29.488 --> 01:00:32.389
Five twists,
six twists half off.

01:00:32.391 --> 01:00:37.129
Six twists, half off.
Six twists, six twists.

01:01:00.385 --> 01:01:02.485
Fresh Oily Cakes.

01:01:02.487 --> 01:01:04.588
Best this side
of the Sandwich Islands.

01:01:04.590 --> 01:01:07.925
Don't look like hardtack.
Or soda bread.

01:01:07.927 --> 01:01:10.594
Look like some
kind of pancake.

01:01:10.596 --> 01:01:13.165
It smells good. What's in it?

01:01:15.667 --> 01:01:19.269
Secret ingredient.
Ancient Chinese secret.

01:01:19.271 --> 01:01:20.704
How much?

01:01:20.706 --> 01:01:22.974
Uh, five ingots
or the equal in trade.

01:01:22.976 --> 01:01:24.476
Mm.

01:01:37.322 --> 01:01:40.759
Good lord! Give me another.

01:01:48.034 --> 01:01:50.669
- That's 11, all right.
- Mmm.

01:01:53.639 --> 01:01:55.138
I'll give you six ingots
for that last one.

01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:56.506
Uh-uh. Mm, mm.

01:01:56.508 --> 01:01:58.475
- Seven shells.
- Come on.

01:01:58.477 --> 01:02:01.313
- Seven shells, one ingot.
- Wait, lads. Hold on.

01:02:11.490 --> 01:02:15.225
Oily cake to this gentleman.

01:02:15.227 --> 01:02:16.929
We'll have more tomorrow.

01:03:16.189 --> 01:03:21.391
Made some oily cakes
with your milk.

01:03:21.393 --> 01:03:23.326
They were very good.

01:03:23.328 --> 01:03:25.497
Couldn't sell them fast enough.

01:03:28.867 --> 01:03:34.738
A little honey, um,

01:03:34.740 --> 01:03:37.642
or it was your milk
in the batter that did it.

01:03:42.848 --> 01:03:49.019
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:49.021 --> 01:03:52.491
What a good, sweet girl you are.

01:03:57.196 --> 01:03:59.429
Hold my place.
I'll be right back.

01:04:05.504 --> 01:04:08.371
- No cuts allowed.
- I was here.

01:04:08.373 --> 01:04:11.942
He was saving my spot.

01:04:11.944 --> 01:04:13.244
One is the limit.

01:04:13.246 --> 01:04:15.447
I heard it from
the Chinaman himself.

01:04:20.552 --> 01:04:22.987
First come,
first served, friends.

01:04:52.384 --> 01:04:54.386
You ought to make
more next time.

01:04:56.721 --> 01:05:00.590
Only so many
we can make in a day, friend.

01:05:00.592 --> 01:05:02.059
They want
to keep them prices up.

01:05:02.061 --> 01:05:03.361
They're not dumb.

01:05:15.907 --> 01:05:17.507
Damn it.
What's in these things?

01:05:17.509 --> 01:05:19.709
Tastes like something
my mama made.

01:05:19.711 --> 01:05:21.444
That's our secret, boys.

01:05:21.446 --> 01:05:23.915
Think of it
as a little taste of home.

01:05:34.193 --> 01:05:36.828
We'll have more tomorrow.

01:05:55.147 --> 01:05:59.582
Could buy an acre
in California for that.

01:05:59.584 --> 01:06:01.818
It's a start, all right.

01:06:01.820 --> 01:06:05.055
It won't last
much longer, though.

01:06:05.057 --> 01:06:08.926
They'll get tired of it,

01:06:08.928 --> 01:06:13.730
and there will be more
milk cows here soon.

01:06:13.732 --> 01:06:18.969
We got a window here, Cookie.

01:06:18.971 --> 01:06:21.205
This is too much
to keep in the house.

01:06:21.207 --> 01:06:24.707
We need a bank.

01:06:24.709 --> 01:06:27.311
What about the cottonwood tree?

01:06:27.313 --> 01:06:30.314
There's a good hole in that.

01:06:30.316 --> 01:06:32.084
Hmm...

01:06:49.302 --> 01:06:52.835
Which side of the tree
has the most branches?

01:06:52.837 --> 01:06:56.040
- Huh?
- The outside.

01:07:46.926 --> 01:07:48.160
Hey.

01:07:51.397 --> 01:07:53.496
Hold one out today.

01:07:53.498 --> 01:07:55.299
Chief Factor wants one.

01:07:55.301 --> 01:07:57.269
He'll be here soon.

01:08:04.542 --> 01:08:06.377
Don't you have work to do?

01:08:06.379 --> 01:08:08.946
I don't need two shadows, do I?

01:08:08.948 --> 01:08:10.715
Get busy.

01:08:27.799 --> 01:08:30.202
Look alive, son.

01:08:41.578 --> 01:08:43.715
I'm saving mine for later.

01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:49.919
No one is giving him
50 shells.

01:08:49.921 --> 01:08:53.589
That ain't worth 50 shells.

01:08:53.591 --> 01:08:58.395
I've heard about your cakes.
I'd like to try one if I may.

01:08:58.397 --> 01:09:01.331
How much?

01:09:01.332 --> 01:09:04.636
For you, only 10 silver pieces.

01:09:38.670 --> 01:09:41.240
A little cinnamon is nice.

01:10:18.177 --> 01:10:20.146
I taste London in this cake.

01:10:24.283 --> 01:10:28.954
A bakery I once knew
in South Kensington.

01:10:33.025 --> 01:10:36.095
Astonishing.

01:10:41.666 --> 01:10:44.234
Where did you learn to do that?

01:10:44.236 --> 01:10:48.905
I was indentured
to a baker in Boston, sir.

01:10:48.907 --> 01:10:52.409
He taught me the trade.

01:10:52.411 --> 01:10:56.881
- He was a good baker.
- Indeed, he was.

01:10:59.851 --> 01:11:01.518
What was his name?

01:11:01.520 --> 01:11:03.821
Barnaby Rose.

01:11:05.958 --> 01:11:09.493
Never heard of him,

01:11:09.495 --> 01:11:11.228
but I commend you, sir,

01:11:11.230 --> 01:11:16.368
on these delicious
baked comestibles.

01:11:19.871 --> 01:11:22.007
I hope you won't
be leaving too soon.

01:11:25.611 --> 01:11:27.346
We have no plans.

01:11:30.449 --> 01:11:33.684
Very, very good.

01:11:40.758 --> 01:11:42.725
Hotel in Saint Francisco

01:11:42.727 --> 01:11:46.764
is harder, more competition.

01:11:50.868 --> 01:11:54.571
Eh, but more opportunity, too,

01:11:54.573 --> 01:11:57.042
more people coming through.

01:11:59.545 --> 01:12:02.778
If it's good idea,

01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:06.083
we'll have enough
to go there soon.

01:12:06.085 --> 01:12:09.720
We have enough to go now.

01:12:09.722 --> 01:12:13.957
Enough to go
but not enough to start.

01:12:26.272 --> 01:12:28.238
Psst.

01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:29.874
Psst!

01:12:31.377 --> 01:12:34.177
Another cup is
another dozen cakes.

01:12:34.179 --> 01:12:37.316
That's another 60 silver pieces
at least.

01:13:03.676 --> 01:13:06.842
Hello?

01:13:06.844 --> 01:13:09.279
Good evening.

01:13:09.281 --> 01:13:10.848
Back again.

01:14:03.202 --> 01:14:07.604
I-I'm entertaining, uh,
a small group next week.

01:14:07.606 --> 01:14:11.341
Captain Ruby is coming for tea,

01:14:11.343 --> 01:14:13.677
and I'm tired of all his jests

01:14:13.679 --> 01:14:18.815
about the savagery
of life on the frontier.

01:14:18.817 --> 01:14:20.717
Tell me.

01:14:20.719 --> 01:14:23.587
Do you know what a clafoutis is?

01:14:23.589 --> 01:14:25.956
- I do.
- Hmm...

01:14:25.958 --> 01:14:28.625
And could you make one,
a-a good one?

01:14:28.627 --> 01:14:32.629
He loves a clafoutis,
and, well, I...

01:14:32.631 --> 01:14:35.265
I'd like to humiliate him.

01:14:35.267 --> 01:14:39.770
Well, without fresh
raspberries or apricots,

01:14:39.772 --> 01:14:41.872
I'm not sure.

01:14:41.874 --> 01:14:45.375
Have you tried bilberry?

01:14:45.377 --> 01:14:49.212
It's out of season, I believe.

01:14:49.214 --> 01:14:51.648
We have plenty of blueberries
on the bush.

01:14:51.650 --> 01:14:53.483
I-I would pay you handsomely

01:14:53.485 --> 01:14:57.322
for a proper
blueberry clafoutis.

01:15:04.096 --> 01:15:06.763
It's a simple enough recipe.

01:15:06.765 --> 01:15:10.734
If blueberry is available,
I'm sure I can make one.

01:15:10.736 --> 01:15:12.068
Capital.

01:15:12.070 --> 01:15:16.139
Saturday, then, a clafoutis,

01:15:16.141 --> 01:15:17.908
and we'll be dining
at my residence.

01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:19.976
You know its whereabouts?

01:15:19.978 --> 01:15:22.479
Uh, uh, I think
I've passed by it

01:15:22.481 --> 01:15:25.949
or I know of it.

01:15:25.951 --> 01:15:27.519
Teatime.

01:16:05.657 --> 01:16:10.160
The hotels in
Saint Francisco are grand.

01:16:10.162 --> 01:16:15.332
We can't compete on that scale,

01:16:15.334 --> 01:16:20.170
and regular travelers
need shelter, too.

01:16:20.172 --> 01:16:24.908
A room with a bed, that's all,

01:16:24.910 --> 01:16:27.112
a few rooms near the sea.

01:16:58.510 --> 01:17:04.314
This is a dangerous game
we're playing here,

01:17:04.316 --> 01:17:08.785
and Chief Factor
has a delicate palate.

01:17:08.787 --> 01:17:11.623
He'll taste his milk
in there eventually.

01:17:34.713 --> 01:17:37.247
We can't say no.

01:17:37.249 --> 01:17:41.217
He'd be suspicious.

01:17:41.219 --> 01:17:44.454
Where does he think
the milk is coming from?

01:17:44.456 --> 01:17:51.261
Some people can't imagine
being stolen from.

01:17:51.263 --> 01:17:52.864
Too strong.

01:17:58.604 --> 01:18:00.806
Let's hope he's one of those.

01:18:04.476 --> 01:18:11.717
How much will we charge, 20, 25?

01:18:32.604 --> 01:18:36.974
That sounds like quite
a situation indeed,

01:18:36.976 --> 01:18:41.811
and in the end, how...
How many lashes did you order?

01:18:41.813 --> 01:18:45.248
20.

01:18:45.250 --> 01:18:49.185
Hmm...
A fine number, but for mutiny...

01:18:49.187 --> 01:18:52.089
It was a memorable day
for that man.

01:18:52.091 --> 01:18:55.625
it seems conservative.

01:18:55.627 --> 01:18:57.460
More than 20 and
he would have been useless

01:18:57.462 --> 01:18:59.329
for the remainder of the voyage.

01:18:59.331 --> 01:19:03.600
- And he was a young hand?
- Mm, not so young.

01:19:03.602 --> 01:19:05.502
Ah.

01:19:05.504 --> 01:19:07.637
Here is the rub, you see.

01:19:07.639 --> 01:19:11.775
When one factors the loss of
labor from the punished hand

01:19:11.777 --> 01:19:13.610
versus the gain of labor

01:19:13.612 --> 01:19:17.014
from those hands
who witness the punishment,

01:19:17.016 --> 01:19:23.520
a stricter punishment
can be the more advisable path.

01:19:23.522 --> 01:19:25.522
Even a properly-rendered death

01:19:25.524 --> 01:19:28.525
can be useful
in the ultimate accounting.

01:19:28.527 --> 01:19:32.796
It is a highly-motivating
spectacle for the indolent,

01:19:32.798 --> 01:19:36.100
let alone the mutinous.

01:19:36.102 --> 01:19:37.734
Yes, fair enough, but...

01:19:37.736 --> 01:19:40.804
some calculations
can never truly be made.

01:19:40.806 --> 01:19:44.340
Now, there you
are wrong, Captain.

01:19:44.342 --> 01:19:45.809
Any question that cannot

01:19:45.811 --> 01:19:48.981
be calculated
is not worth the asking.

01:19:50.983 --> 01:19:53.817
Ah. Here is our baker.

01:19:53.819 --> 01:19:58.254
Uh, bring the clafoutis
in... in here, Cookie.

01:19:58.256 --> 01:20:00.425
Show the captain.

01:20:17.542 --> 01:20:21.711
Indeed, it is
a fine-looking cake, Mister...

01:20:21.713 --> 01:20:24.115
Figowitz.

01:20:24.117 --> 01:20:28.185
And what brought you to the
Oregon Territory, Mr. Figowitz?

01:20:28.187 --> 01:20:31.488
Oh, chance.

01:20:31.490 --> 01:20:33.356
I hired on
with a trapping company.

01:20:33.358 --> 01:20:37.494
- Ah, Ashley's men.
- No, a lesser crew.

01:20:37.496 --> 01:20:39.763
They're trapping out
the whole map.

01:20:39.765 --> 01:20:41.664
There won't be any pelts here
much longer.

01:20:41.666 --> 01:20:45.938
I disagree.
The beaver here are endless.

01:20:47.272 --> 01:20:50.907
Smart animals, the beaver.

01:20:50.909 --> 01:20:54.145
When I got here,
the beaver were everywhere,

01:20:54.147 --> 01:20:56.046
whole cities of beaver

01:20:56.048 --> 01:20:58.515
living like people
in row houses in New York.

01:21:02.287 --> 01:21:03.686
Well, in any case,

01:21:03.688 --> 01:21:05.288
the fashions are changing
in Paris.

01:21:05.290 --> 01:21:09.692
The beaver hat is on the wane.

01:21:09.694 --> 01:21:12.495
The... The Chinese market
remains strong.

01:21:12.497 --> 01:21:14.330
Beaver will always find a home.

01:21:14.332 --> 01:21:16.967
It is too beautiful, too supple.

01:21:16.969 --> 01:21:19.170
Hmm. Mm.

01:21:19.172 --> 01:21:21.005
Ah.

01:21:21.007 --> 01:21:24.541
Wh-What he's saying is
that the men in Paris

01:21:24.543 --> 01:21:28.311
favor new hats this season.

01:21:28.313 --> 01:21:31.381
They no longer want beaver fur.

01:21:39.491 --> 01:21:41.558
But... But I'm saying to him

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:46.065
that the beaver here
will last forever.

01:22:24.402 --> 01:22:25.970
He's saying
he doesn't understand

01:22:25.972 --> 01:22:27.670
why the white men
hunt so much beaver

01:22:27.672 --> 01:22:29.572
and never eat the tail.

01:22:29.574 --> 01:22:32.475
- The tail is delicious.
- Huh.

01:22:32.477 --> 01:22:33.978
Well, maybe I will.

01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:36.113
I'm sick to death
of salmon already.

01:22:40.652 --> 01:22:42.385
You can tell him that.

01:22:42.387 --> 01:22:45.455
Ah, here we are.

01:22:45.457 --> 01:22:50.896
Chinese black tea, very subtle.

01:22:53.498 --> 01:22:54.934
Uh, cream?

01:23:00.705 --> 01:23:03.173
Enjoy the cream, Captain.

01:23:03.175 --> 01:23:04.908
My cow gives so little.

01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:07.644
She's a lonely girl, I fear.

01:23:07.646 --> 01:23:10.580
- You have a cow?
- Yes. She's only been here

01:23:10.582 --> 01:23:13.650
for a month or so,
sans husband, I'm afraid.

01:23:13.652 --> 01:23:16.721
I'm hoping to find her
a mate within the year.

01:23:19.791 --> 01:23:23.160
Would you like to see her?

01:23:23.162 --> 01:23:24.997
Let... Let's take a walk.

01:23:26.198 --> 01:23:27.632
Shall we?

01:24:03.369 --> 01:24:06.036
Tell me, Captain,

01:24:06.038 --> 01:24:10.107
what are the fashions in Paris
this year?

01:24:10.109 --> 01:24:11.908
Hmm...

01:24:11.910 --> 01:24:16.213
The ladies are moving away from
the Empire silhouette this year.

01:24:16.215 --> 01:24:22.186
They're favoring fuller skirts
and, uh, visible corseting.

01:24:22.188 --> 01:24:25.922
For the men, broad shoulders
and puffed sleeves,

01:24:25.924 --> 01:24:28.058
trousers for smart day wear,

01:24:28.060 --> 01:24:31.861
britches and cordon
in the country.

01:24:31.863 --> 01:24:36.033
As for colors, canary yellow
and turkey red

01:24:36.035 --> 01:24:38.801
are the colors <i>du jour.</i>

01:24:38.803 --> 01:24:41.704
History moves so quickly
in Paris.

01:24:41.706 --> 01:24:44.341
So quickly,
it wears itself out.

01:24:44.343 --> 01:24:47.510
It never reaches here at all.

01:25:14.206 --> 01:25:17.074
She seems well enough.

01:25:17.076 --> 01:25:18.976
Yes.

01:25:18.978 --> 01:25:22.845
And yet she barely
produces a thing.

01:25:22.847 --> 01:25:26.849
- What's her provenance?
- Oh, she's of a good line,

01:25:26.851 --> 01:25:31.522
half Alderney
and half from Froment du Leon

01:25:31.524 --> 01:25:33.390
from the province of Brittany.

01:25:48.606 --> 01:25:53.345
She's a very fine cow.

01:26:03.456 --> 01:26:07.890
Froment du Leon
from the province of Brittany.

01:26:07.892 --> 01:26:11.661
The cow has got
better breeding than I do.

01:26:11.663 --> 01:26:13.631
A royal cow.

01:26:16.936 --> 01:26:19.238
Maybe we should halt
for a while.

01:26:22.841 --> 01:26:28.245
I think the Captain
sensed something.

01:26:28.247 --> 01:26:31.014
Hm. Now is our time.

01:26:31.016 --> 01:26:33.050
Another cow is on the way.
And more cows after that.

01:26:33.052 --> 01:26:37.087
- And Chief Factor is...
- Is a fool.

01:26:37.089 --> 01:26:40.656
He misses everything
right under his nose.

01:26:40.658 --> 01:26:44.394
Paris this, London that.

01:26:44.396 --> 01:26:45.663
What kind of woman is he?

01:26:50.102 --> 01:26:55.372
Men like us, Cookie,
we have to make our own way.

01:26:55.374 --> 01:27:00.944
There are no Empire silhouettes
or colors <i>du jour</i> for us.

01:27:00.946 --> 01:27:03.915
We have to take what we can
when the taking is good.

01:27:09.088 --> 01:27:10.422
I know.

01:27:13.392 --> 01:27:14.724
We'll sell a little longer,

01:27:14.726 --> 01:27:16.728
and then we'll make
our way south.

01:27:20.933 --> 01:27:24.103
We haven't even begun, Cookie.

01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:37.930
Psst, psst, psst, psst, psst!

01:30:42.034 --> 01:30:44.101
Come on back.

01:30:44.103 --> 01:30:47.903
Come on back, you stupid cat!

01:30:47.905 --> 01:30:49.641
Inside, before you get me
in trouble.

01:31:14.867 --> 01:31:16.366
Aah!

01:31:30.849 --> 01:31:32.616
Are you all right?

01:31:32.618 --> 01:31:36.919
Mm.

01:31:36.921 --> 01:31:39.489
- Can you move?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:31:39.491 --> 01:31:41.059
We got to go.

01:31:44.229 --> 01:31:45.395
Something...
Someone in the meadow!

01:31:45.397 --> 01:31:47.030
- What?
- Attackers all around!

01:31:47.032 --> 01:31:48.899
- What?
- I woke the house! Get dressed.

01:31:48.901 --> 01:31:50.669
Hurry!

01:32:06.084 --> 01:32:08.187
God's sake, Thomas!

01:32:10.522 --> 01:32:12.357
You there!

01:33:11.016 --> 01:33:15.721
It would appear that someone
has been milking your cow.

01:33:26.865 --> 01:33:33.171
Figowitz, the Chinaman.

01:33:37.643 --> 01:33:39.545
Figowitz!

01:33:49.154 --> 01:33:51.089
No, no. Not home.

01:34:29.328 --> 01:34:32.195
Which way?

01:34:32.197 --> 01:34:34.497
The deer path is up
back up over there,

01:34:34.499 --> 01:34:37.300
- but the river path is...
- Stealing my milk.

01:34:37.302 --> 01:34:38.802
I'll kill him!

01:34:38.804 --> 01:34:40.570
Shh! Do you hear that?

01:34:40.572 --> 01:34:42.841
What's that? What's that?

01:35:19.778 --> 01:35:23.513
There's one
crossing the river, sir!

01:35:23.515 --> 01:35:25.815
We'll overtake him on foot!

01:35:25.817 --> 01:35:27.384
Use the path downriver!

01:35:27.386 --> 01:35:30.489
Lloyd, you hurry on,
and we'll... we'll follow!

01:35:32.157 --> 01:35:33.825
Yes, sir!

01:37:09.688 --> 01:37:11.821
Lehayim.

01:37:11.823 --> 01:37:13.023
Lehayim.

01:37:13.025 --> 01:37:16.394
I-Is this your canoe?
I need to go downriver.

01:38:04.243 --> 01:38:07.610
Din-din-din.

01:38:07.612 --> 01:38:09.345
Ding-a-ling-a-ling?

01:38:09.347 --> 01:38:11.314
Mm.

01:39:44.676 --> 01:39:47.712
I need to find my friend.

01:40:14.472 --> 01:40:16.508
And also know where I am.

01:45:02.727 --> 01:45:06.697
- Not even northwest.
- Ah, over here?

01:45:06.699 --> 01:45:09.001
- He's probably got a mustache.
- Huh?

01:45:49.675 --> 01:45:51.807
Aye, Johnny Hart.

01:45:51.809 --> 01:45:54.011
Ha!

01:45:55.547 --> 01:45:58.415
The home is totally
abandoned, that one.

01:45:58.417 --> 01:46:01.518
Heart, heart like
a red beating heart?

01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:05.155
No, like,
uh, Hart like a deer.

01:46:05.157 --> 01:46:07.658
Aye.

01:46:07.660 --> 01:46:10.327
Jon Hart...

01:46:10.329 --> 01:46:13.297
a cheater by any spelling.

01:46:13.299 --> 01:46:16.899
I've skunked him
every game, regardless.

01:46:16.901 --> 01:46:19.703
He's not a worthy opponent.

01:46:19.705 --> 01:46:23.640
He prefers to discard
just one card to the crib.

01:46:23.642 --> 01:46:28.278
- One card?
- Aye. Abysmal.

01:46:31.550 --> 01:46:34.318
It's an archaic rule,

01:46:34.320 --> 01:46:40.257
but he prefers the old ways.

01:46:40.259 --> 01:46:41.758
Aye.

01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:46.330
The guy a poor adversary is on
John Suckling's noble game.

01:46:46.332 --> 01:46:49.199
Cribbage players are in
short supply in this hemisphere.

01:46:49.201 --> 01:46:50.300
Aye.

01:46:50.302 --> 01:46:53.005
I've suffered for it daily.

01:51:34.353 --> 01:51:38.788
Thought you were gone.

01:51:38.790 --> 01:51:41.393
I thought <i>you</i> were
gone.

01:51:52.638 --> 01:51:54.239
You're hurt?

01:51:58.011 --> 01:51:59.611
Uh...

01:52:03.515 --> 01:52:07.350
It's not good here, Cookie.

01:52:07.352 --> 01:52:09.388
It's not safe.

01:52:11.757 --> 01:52:13.291
We have to go.

01:52:14.593 --> 01:52:16.695
Get away from here.

01:52:24.269 --> 01:52:26.371
We'll tell our stories later.

01:52:28.340 --> 01:52:30.640
That's quite a scratch
on your head.

01:52:30.642 --> 01:52:33.010
We'll clean it when we rest.

01:52:33.012 --> 01:52:34.947
How about that?

01:53:19.291 --> 01:53:22.093
There's a port
at the mouth of the river.

01:53:22.095 --> 01:53:24.461
We will go downstream and
catch the first clipper south.

01:53:24.463 --> 01:53:26.331
How about that?

01:53:37.275 --> 01:53:39.946
Why is a baker like a beggar?

01:53:43.682 --> 01:53:46.183
Why?

01:53:46.185 --> 01:53:48.185
They both need bread.

01:53:50.990 --> 01:53:53.590
You'll make it.

01:53:53.592 --> 01:53:56.493
You just need
to stay on your feet.

01:55:41.033 --> 01:55:46.136
This is, uh,
a good place to rest.

01:55:46.138 --> 01:55:48.440
No one can see us here.

01:55:54.779 --> 01:55:59.083
You lie there on the needles,

01:55:59.085 --> 01:56:01.118
and I'll keep first watch.

01:57:04.383 --> 01:57:07.952
We'll go soon.

01:57:07.954 --> 01:57:09.521
I've got you.

02:01:31.294 --> 02:01:36.294
