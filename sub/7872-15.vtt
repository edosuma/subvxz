WEBVTT

00:23.556 --> 00:25.224
D'oh!

00:25.226 --> 00:26.558
(tires screeching)

00:26.560 --> 00:28.227
(grunts)

00:28.229 --> 00:30.562
(whirring)

00:30.564 --> 00:34.533
Mmm. Paper jam.

00:46.079 --> 00:49.081
Okay, Dad, I'm ready for Take
Your Daughter to Work Day.

00:49.083 --> 00:51.583
How come there's never
a Take Your Son to Work Day?

00:51.585 --> 00:55.421
'Cause boys are already on
track to get all the good jobs.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.156
<i>The Dirty Dozen?</i>
<i>All guys.</i>

00:57.158 --> 00:59.091
<i>Twelve Angry Men?</i> Uh, men!

00:59.093 --> 01:01.060
<i>The X-Men?</i> Mostly men.

01:01.062 --> 01:02.428
(Bart and Homer laugh)

01:02.430 --> 01:04.263
Good one, Dad.
Yeah.

01:04.265 --> 01:07.933
Well, despite all that,
today's going to be fun, Dad!

01:07.935 --> 01:09.768
Will there be lots
of other girls there?

01:09.770 --> 01:11.837
Just a few. For some reason,
there's been a lot

01:11.839 --> 01:14.306
of infertility
at the nuclear plant.

01:20.947 --> 01:24.450
After we show you the wealth
of jobs in the steno pool,

01:24.452 --> 01:27.619
a hearty luncheon of bison
with lake beaver will be served.

01:27.621 --> 01:28.687
GIRLS:
Ew!

01:28.689 --> 01:30.189
And upon leaving,

01:30.191 --> 01:31.790
you will each receive
a piece of orangewood

01:31.792 --> 01:33.459
to bite down on
during childbirth.

01:33.461 --> 01:35.627
(chuckles)
Excellent.

01:35.629 --> 01:36.628
(person applauds)

01:36.630 --> 01:37.763
It's getting harder
and harder

01:37.765 --> 01:40.099
to maintain my sunny
disposition, Smithers.

01:40.101 --> 01:41.533
Oh, you're always
my ray of...

01:41.535 --> 01:42.968
Shut up.

01:42.970 --> 01:44.603
Dad, what does that do?

01:44.605 --> 01:46.271
I don't know.
Who's that guy?

01:46.273 --> 01:47.973
I don't know.
Where do those
pipes lead?

01:47.975 --> 01:49.475
Not sure.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.110
Is it called the cooling
tower because there's...

01:51.112 --> 01:53.145
Not my department.
How many kilowatts are...?

01:53.147 --> 01:54.746
Look, sweetie,
would you like to go

01:54.748 --> 01:56.648
to the cafeteria
and get some ice cream?

01:56.650 --> 01:58.650
How many kinds
are there?
12.

01:58.652 --> 02:00.319
Curse that Elon Musk!

02:00.321 --> 02:02.254
Thanks to that Earth-smooching
buttinski,

02:02.256 --> 02:03.655
I'm on the verge of bankruptcy.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.491
All I have left
are the clothes on my back

02:05.493 --> 02:07.259
and the clones in my freezer.

02:07.261 --> 02:10.262
43 is missing again.

02:10.264 --> 02:13.799
I had to replace my beloved
hounds with teacup poodles.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.501
It's pathetic. Watch.

02:15.503 --> 02:17.102
Release the hounds.

02:17.104 --> 02:18.170
(barking)

02:18.172 --> 02:19.571
(chuckling):
Aw.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.342
No. Help. Oh, stop.

02:23.344 --> 02:25.077
Oh, spare me.

02:25.079 --> 02:27.913
And all I got from Mr. Musk
was an electric car,

02:27.915 --> 02:30.983
which I charge by stealing power
from my nosy neighbor.

02:37.257 --> 02:39.258
Hey, dippily-do, neighbor-oni!

02:39.260 --> 02:41.593
Stupid Branson.

02:41.595 --> 02:43.262
But I have a new scheme

02:43.264 --> 02:46.598
that will undo the terrible
damage done by my other schemes.

02:46.600 --> 02:48.500
I have an appointment
with a Nigerian King

02:48.502 --> 02:51.770
to negotiate a uranium deal that
will put me right back on top.

02:51.772 --> 02:53.772
Huh. Nothing can stop you, sir.

02:53.774 --> 02:57.776
But, uh, not that you're not
at the top of your game.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.778
Uh, what if you
don't get the deal?

02:59.780 --> 03:01.180
I'll just have
to sell everything

03:01.182 --> 03:02.848
and move
to the South Pacific with you.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.349
What a grim fate
that would be.

03:05.618 --> 03:07.186
And with your omelet,

03:07.188 --> 03:09.621
would you like the fried
potatoes or the mixed berries?

03:09.623 --> 03:14.059
I'll have the berries.

03:14.061 --> 03:15.227
Ah.

03:15.229 --> 03:18.130
A terrible fate
indeed, sir.

03:21.401 --> 03:25.237
Oh, no. My almond milk
leaked all over everything.

03:25.239 --> 03:27.739
Dad, do you have anything
I can eat?

03:27.741 --> 03:31.076
Hmm?

03:31.078 --> 03:34.813
Oh, uh, I will turn this corn
chip into a wonderful meal,

03:34.815 --> 03:37.749
using my greatest skill--
lunchroom trading!

03:37.751 --> 03:39.318
Shut your eyes.

03:41.254 --> 03:45.324
("The Thieving Magpie"
by Rossini plays)

03:49.762 --> 03:52.264
Pretty impressive, Homer.

03:52.266 --> 03:54.099
But what about
the presentation?

03:54.101 --> 03:57.269
The eyes taste first,
then lips, then palette.

03:57.271 --> 04:00.239
Then the body's
harshest critic-- the colon.

04:00.241 --> 04:03.675
(Rossini's
"Thieving Magpie" plays)

04:11.017 --> 04:15.087
Okay, sweetie,
open those baby blacks.

04:15.089 --> 04:17.256
(gasps)
Wow, Dad.

04:17.258 --> 04:18.757
(giggles)

04:18.759 --> 04:20.259
Thank you. Ooh.

04:20.261 --> 04:22.828
Welcome, Your Majesty.

04:28.968 --> 04:31.536
Mr. Burns, I don't know
what you have heard,

04:31.538 --> 04:34.239
but I do not eat monkey brains
from a skull.

04:34.241 --> 04:37.175
Oh, this is for me.

04:38.611 --> 04:41.580
Before we begin,
I have a favor to ask.

04:41.582 --> 04:43.749
(sucking
through straw)

04:43.751 --> 04:45.484
My daughter is
traveling with me.

04:45.486 --> 04:46.918
Hello.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.654
She is my true treasure.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.989
During our complicated
negotiations,

04:50.991 --> 04:53.125
I need someone
to look after her,

04:53.127 --> 04:54.559
keep her out of trouble.

04:55.962 --> 04:58.196
Hmm.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.771
That man is the perfect choice.

05:05.773 --> 05:07.673
What?! Sir, that's
Homer Simpson.

05:07.675 --> 05:10.242
You forgot that
he's the most incompetent...

05:13.012 --> 05:15.247
(both laughing)

05:15.249 --> 05:18.650
Homer Simpson
would be perfect.

05:21.087 --> 05:24.323
Simpson, all you have
to do is babysit the princess--

05:24.325 --> 05:26.758
keeping her in this hotel
room during the negotiations.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.260
Babysitting, eh?

05:28.262 --> 05:30.162
What do I know about kids?

05:30.164 --> 05:33.999
Homer Simpson, I give you
Princess Kemi of Nigeria!

05:34.001 --> 05:36.335
Watch that girl
like a hawk.

05:38.338 --> 05:40.605
(screams)

05:40.607 --> 05:42.607
Princess, why'd you put on
that coat?

05:42.609 --> 05:44.776
You're obviously cold.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.945
May I escort you
to the radiator?

05:46.947 --> 05:48.780
No. I want to go out.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.449
I'm 25 years old.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.950
(phone ringing)

05:51.952 --> 05:53.352
Uh, just a second.

05:53.354 --> 05:55.187
Hey, Marge.
Yeah, I'm working late.

05:55.189 --> 05:56.722
Yup, special project.

05:56.724 --> 05:59.124
Lenny said you
were babysitting,

05:59.126 --> 06:00.892
and if you are
babysitting,

06:00.894 --> 06:02.294
why can't you do some at home?

06:02.296 --> 06:03.895
I could use a night out.

06:03.897 --> 06:06.565
Sorry, Marge,
but I am the royal babysitter.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.400
If I start watching commoners,

06:08.402 --> 06:11.069
the tongues
of the court will be awag.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.405
Really? Awag? Really?

06:13.407 --> 06:14.973
Well, if you think that...

06:14.975 --> 06:17.075
(beeps off)
I want to go out

06:17.077 --> 06:19.411
and see the America
whose greatest cities

06:19.413 --> 06:21.747
I've only seen
destroyed in movies.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.582
I see. You want excitement.

06:23.584 --> 06:28.420
Princess, have you ever heard of
Studio 54, CBGBs, the Roxbury?

06:28.422 --> 06:29.921
Yes! I've dreamed of...

06:29.923 --> 06:31.423
All gone.

06:31.425 --> 06:34.493
But in their place, we have
500 channels of television.

06:34.495 --> 06:35.927
All awesome.

06:35.929 --> 06:37.662
Sit down, and I'll show you.

06:40.767 --> 06:45.771
So, all these concubines belong
to this one tyrant?

06:45.773 --> 06:47.239
He's called "The Bachelor."

06:47.241 --> 06:49.074
Please let me go out.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.076
All right, Princess.

06:51.078 --> 06:55.080
I'll take you to a place
that's fun with a capital "F."

06:55.082 --> 06:57.682
(grunting)

06:57.684 --> 06:59.684
Moe, this is Kemi.

06:59.686 --> 07:02.120
She's an honest-to-God princess.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.455
Ah, really?

07:03.457 --> 07:04.923
Hey, tell me something.

07:04.925 --> 07:06.425
I heard that
Queen Elizabeth

07:06.427 --> 07:08.026
in person is actually
not that funny.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.461
I am from Africa.

07:09.463 --> 07:11.129
Wow, Africa.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.031
I had a good friend who
really wanted to go there.

07:13.033 --> 07:15.133
So, uh, you speak
English there?

07:15.135 --> 07:16.968
I speak five languages.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.303
(sputters)
Nobody does.

07:18.305 --> 07:20.372
(speaking Portuguese)

07:20.374 --> 07:21.807
(speaking French)

07:21.809 --> 07:23.575
(speaking Spanish)

07:23.577 --> 07:26.411
(speaking Japanese)

07:26.413 --> 07:27.979
Uh, which means what?

07:27.981 --> 07:30.482
"I don't wish to show off."

07:30.484 --> 07:32.150
Yeah, that's pretty good there,

07:32.152 --> 07:34.319
uh, but don't expect me
to bow and scrape.

07:34.321 --> 07:36.121
Uh, well,
I'll give you one scrape.

07:36.123 --> 07:38.423
Yeah, that's it, Majesty.

07:38.425 --> 07:40.091
Notice I didn't say "Your."

07:40.093 --> 07:41.626
(laughs)

07:41.628 --> 07:43.662
Oh, they don't make them
like you in Nigeria.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.330
Nigeria?

07:45.332 --> 07:47.532
Homer, can I speak
to you in private?

07:49.001 --> 07:51.002
(grunting)

07:51.004 --> 07:52.471
Can I try it?

07:52.473 --> 07:54.005
Ah, you got to be
mad at something.

07:54.007 --> 07:55.740
Well, I'm mad
I'm not doing it.

07:56.976 --> 07:59.177
Okay, I'll tell you
why I'm mad.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.780
A few months back,
I got an unsolicited e-mail

08:01.782 --> 08:04.916
from an actual
Nigerian prince.

08:04.918 --> 08:06.985
♪

08:06.987 --> 08:10.155
<i>The prince needed to transfer</i>
<i>$40 million out of the country.</i>

08:10.157 --> 08:11.923
<i>He offered</i>
<i>to split that with me</i>

<i>if I paid the five grand</i>
<i>for the transfer fees.</i>

08:14.261 --> 08:15.760
HOMER:

08:15.762 --> 08:17.162
MOE:
<i>Yeah, I did.</i>

08:17.164 --> 08:19.097
<i>I was sure</i>
<i>the guy was on the level</i>

08:19.099 --> 08:21.566
<i>because of his bad spelling</i>
<i>and grammar.</i>

08:26.439 --> 08:29.274
Now, guess how much
of the $20 million I saw?

08:29.276 --> 08:31.610
$8 million?
Ze-ro.

08:31.612 --> 08:32.944
Get out of here!

08:32.946 --> 08:35.280
If Kemi there is
a Nigerian princess,

08:35.282 --> 08:37.849
her brother just might be
the Nigerian prince

08:37.851 --> 08:39.684
that took my money!

08:39.686 --> 08:43.522
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Listen,
Moe, I'm Kemi's guardian.

08:43.524 --> 08:47.058
She and I are going back
to the hotel now!

08:47.060 --> 08:48.894
(gasps)
She's gone!

08:48.896 --> 08:50.395
And she trashed my bar!

08:50.397 --> 08:52.564
Oh, no, wait. She actually
cleaned up a little bit.

08:52.566 --> 08:54.132
Yeah, good for her.

08:58.738 --> 09:00.405
(panting):
Chief, thank God!

09:00.407 --> 09:03.909
I was drinking at Moe's,
and I lost an African princess!

09:03.911 --> 09:06.077
Lost African princess, eh?

09:06.079 --> 09:07.913
Well, lucky for you,
she just happens

09:07.915 --> 09:09.915
to be in the back
of my cruiser.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.651
Yes! The prayer I forgot
to say has been answered.

09:14.587 --> 09:16.254
What the...?

09:16.256 --> 09:18.924
You're going straight
to the drunk tank, rummy.

09:18.926 --> 09:21.092
"African princess."

09:21.094 --> 09:22.761
(distant gunshots)

09:22.763 --> 09:25.931
Chief, I just saw someone
robbin' the Kwik-E-Mart!

09:25.933 --> 09:29.668
Oh, now African princesses are
robbing the Kwik-E-Mart, huh?

09:29.670 --> 09:31.903
Get in the car,
booze bag.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.072
Chief, I have been shot
in the shoulder!

09:34.074 --> 09:35.607
In the car!

09:35.609 --> 09:37.776
What is this,
St. Patrick's Day?

09:37.778 --> 09:39.444
Why, this is terrible.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.947
Can't even think of anything
to mumble to myself.

09:41.949 --> 09:44.015
That's how upset I am here.

09:44.017 --> 09:47.118
Hello. First of all,
I wanted to pay.

09:47.120 --> 09:50.956
Also... maybe... I wanted
to talk more to you?

09:50.958 --> 09:52.624
Really?

09:52.626 --> 09:55.927
<i>Okay there, Moe,</i>
<i>you got to get to the brother,</i>

09:55.929 --> 09:58.597
<i>because he knows what</i>
<i>my PIN number is, and I forgot.</i>

09:58.599 --> 10:00.098
Yeah, duly noted.

10:00.100 --> 10:03.635
Uh, so, Your Tootsieness,
tell me about your family.

10:03.637 --> 10:05.804
Got any aunts, uncles,
cousins, sisters...

10:05.806 --> 10:07.305
brothers?

10:07.307 --> 10:09.140
I have a brother.
Yes. One.

10:09.142 --> 10:10.775
I see.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.811
<i>Now, Moe, don't jump</i>
<i>to conclusions.</i>

10:12.813 --> 10:14.646
<i>A lot of people have brothers.</i>

10:14.648 --> 10:16.281
Does he have a computer?
Yes.

<i>It's him!</i>

10:19.252 --> 10:20.819
thanks for bailing me out,

10:20.821 --> 10:22.487
but I still have
a huge problem.

10:22.489 --> 10:23.989
Well, till we find her,

10:23.991 --> 10:26.925
maybe we could get somebody
to pretend to be her.

10:26.927 --> 10:29.661
You know, get a nice wig
and a dress.

10:29.663 --> 10:33.331
Oh, no, I am not dressing up
like an African princess.

10:33.333 --> 10:36.468
I am not! I am not! I am not!

10:36.470 --> 10:39.104
Thank you for listening
to my objections.

10:39.106 --> 10:40.672
Well, you were
really vehement.

10:40.674 --> 10:42.173
(phone ringing)

10:42.175 --> 10:43.775
Uh, hello, Simpson.
Just checking up.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.443
May I speak
with the princess?

10:45.445 --> 10:47.178
Um, yeah, sure. Uh...

10:47.180 --> 10:49.014
(high-pitched Southern accent):
Hello, this is the princess.

10:49.016 --> 10:53.418
I'm with Homer Simpson, and
I do declare he's wonderful.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.920
Oh, that's right,
I'm from South Africa.

10:55.922 --> 10:57.656
Fiddle-dee-dee.

10:57.658 --> 10:59.157
(laughing):
Well, sounds like

10:59.159 --> 11:00.759
everything's going
just the way I want it.

11:00.761 --> 11:03.662
Yeah, so all my money's
tied up in this "jernt."

11:03.664 --> 11:05.764
Can't even afford
elocution lessons

11:05.766 --> 11:07.932
to teach me how
to pronounce "joint."

11:07.934 --> 11:10.602
I guess I could do it online,
but, uh, what's the "pernt"?

11:10.604 --> 11:11.670
(laughs)

11:11.672 --> 11:13.104
What-What's so funny?

11:13.106 --> 11:15.106
I thought
my English was perfect,

11:15.108 --> 11:17.809
but you make me feel
even better about it.

11:17.811 --> 11:20.445
(chuckles) Eh, usually
people that tease me

11:20.447 --> 11:22.113
get thrown out on their ass.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.115
But, uh, your sayin' it
made me feel good.

11:24.117 --> 11:27.185
Geez, I sound like one
of those guys in them rom coms

11:27.187 --> 11:30.955
that play at the theaters
next to the theater I'm in. Heh.

11:30.957 --> 11:34.859
So, uh, what's a "princessess"
like you, uh, do all day, huh?

11:34.861 --> 11:38.396
A lot of spinning wheels and
witches treating you like crap?

11:38.398 --> 11:40.465
I read. Are you familiar
with the books

11:40.467 --> 11:42.467
by my countryman Chinua Achebe,

11:42.469 --> 11:45.070
<i>Things Fall Apart</i>
<i>and</i> <i>No Longer At Ease?</i>

11:45.072 --> 11:47.906
Hey, you guys got real
optimistic literature there.

11:47.908 --> 11:50.742
(giggles)
Fair comment.

11:50.744 --> 11:53.912
(yawns)
I haven't eaten all day.

11:53.914 --> 11:56.081
Well, don't eat those eggs!
Uh, we don't know

11:56.083 --> 11:57.749
what kind of bird
they turn into.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.584
But there's
a string cheese or something

11:59.586 --> 12:02.487
in the fridge in the back.
Uh, help yourself.

12:02.489 --> 12:05.423
All right, after she eats,
I'd better close up.

12:05.425 --> 12:08.159
(yawns)
Oh. Come on, pal.

12:11.263 --> 12:13.264
(grunts)
Come on.

12:13.266 --> 12:16.334
That's really stuck there good.

12:19.939 --> 12:23.308
Ah, I can't be mad
at her no more.

12:33.686 --> 12:35.019
Good night,
moon.

12:35.021 --> 12:37.288
Good night, broom.

12:37.290 --> 12:40.191
Good night, jukebox
that won't play a tune.

12:40.193 --> 12:41.526
Good night, eggs.

12:41.528 --> 12:43.027
Good night, dregs.

12:43.029 --> 12:45.797
Good night, bugs
crawlin' up my legs.

12:45.799 --> 12:48.366
Good night, beer.
Good night, mice.

12:48.368 --> 12:51.603
Good night, princess
who treats me nice.

12:51.605 --> 12:52.971
Yeah.

12:52.973 --> 12:56.040
(yawns)

13:00.412 --> 13:04.315
So my offer for one ton
of your uranium is a goat.

13:04.317 --> 13:06.317
Will you stop
offering me that?

13:06.319 --> 13:08.787
I come from a modern nation
of 90 million people.

13:08.789 --> 13:11.656
Two goats.
You are starting
to insult me.

13:11.658 --> 13:13.324
All right,
let's cut to the chase.

13:13.326 --> 13:16.928
My board has given me
permission to go up to 12 goats.

13:16.930 --> 13:18.997
(grumbles)

13:21.801 --> 13:23.301
How about here, sir?

13:23.303 --> 13:24.803
Looks good to me.

13:24.805 --> 13:27.338
I'm so sorry
I pretended not to be gay

13:27.340 --> 13:28.973
for all those years.

13:28.975 --> 13:32.177
Well, better an old queen
than never a queen at all.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.546
(chuckles)

13:36.682 --> 13:38.483
Pay attention.
My last offer:

13:38.485 --> 13:39.984
20 million goats.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.921
Okay, but no dogs
disguised as goats.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.156
Oh, great,
here comes the haggling.

13:45.158 --> 13:48.593
Well, well, look
who's up. Heh.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.662
Uh, Princess, I'm gonna
do something for you

13:50.664 --> 13:54.265
I've never done for anyone
in this bar. Call you a cab.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.334
No. I want
to spend time with you.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.436
I want to see this town.

13:58.438 --> 14:00.171
Do you mind ridin' a
cute little scooter

14:00.173 --> 14:01.673
with your arms
around my waist?

14:01.675 --> 14:03.174
I don't.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.776
To the scooter store.

14:04.778 --> 14:07.745
♪

14:23.128 --> 14:25.463
And after you eat the soup
you can eat the bowl

14:25.465 --> 14:26.898
or you can put
"kerns" in it.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.300
What, uh, whatever
you like.

14:32.972 --> 14:34.806
I have a confession to make.

14:34.808 --> 14:36.574
This is my first montage.

14:36.576 --> 14:39.978
Just relax and enjoy the music.

14:41.413 --> 14:42.914
Moe Szyslak.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.916
This is the part
of the fairy tale

14:44.918 --> 14:47.085
where the princess
goes back to the hotel

14:47.087 --> 14:49.087
and watches TV.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.655
Come with me.

14:52.091 --> 14:53.591
So where are we
headed, dude?

14:53.593 --> 14:55.426
Just go and go fast.

14:55.428 --> 14:59.097
Okay, um, usually I do kind of a
funny take on an airline pilot

14:59.099 --> 15:02.000
greeting the passengers. You
know, like, "Hey. Thank you

15:02.002 --> 15:04.602
"for flying Air Kevin.
If you look out

15:04.604 --> 15:06.271
to the left of the
pedicab, you..."

15:06.273 --> 15:07.572
Just move the pedals.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.607
Whoa, sounds
like the tower

15:09.609 --> 15:12.277
has cleared us
for takeoff.

15:12.279 --> 15:15.079
We're tryin' to escape that guy.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.749
Well, dude, as long as he
can run, he can beat us.

15:17.751 --> 15:19.851
D'oh!

15:19.853 --> 15:24.022
So, anyways, the place that
I really feel the pedaling?

15:24.024 --> 15:25.290
It's my legs.

15:25.292 --> 15:26.858
Okay, all right,
we're safe.

15:26.860 --> 15:28.960
Actually, I wanted
to go back with him.

15:28.962 --> 15:31.596
I don't want to get
my father mad, O.

15:31.598 --> 15:33.598
Go back? But I didn't
show you the place

15:33.600 --> 15:35.466
where Dave Grohl
got mugged.

15:35.468 --> 15:39.304
I have to leave, but I
still had a wonderful day.

15:39.306 --> 15:42.473
MOE:
<i>Thank God I shaved</i>
<i>my forehead this morning.</i>

15:42.475 --> 15:45.443
(gasps) A paparazzo.
Please don't send that.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.146
If my father sees it,
it will ruin my life.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.782
Well, thanks
for making it so easy.

16:01.493 --> 16:03.494
And you have
the 20 million goats?

16:03.496 --> 16:04.796
Two, now.

16:04.798 --> 16:08.333
19,999,998

16:08.335 --> 16:09.834
on delivery.

16:09.836 --> 16:12.003
Very good.
Um, shouldn't we

16:12.005 --> 16:13.504
see how the
princess is doing

16:13.506 --> 16:14.839
before you sign,
Your Majesty?

16:14.841 --> 16:16.140
What are you talking
about, Smithers?

16:16.142 --> 16:19.177
(phone dings)

16:19.179 --> 16:21.179
(gasps)
I can't even trust you

16:21.181 --> 16:23.948
to watch an impetuous adult
who does what she wants.

16:23.950 --> 16:26.317
The deal is off.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.486
SMITHERS:
<i>Wow. After spending</i>
<i>my life serving others,</i>

16:28.488 --> 16:30.488
<i>I'm finally gonna</i>
<i>get what I want.</i>

16:30.490 --> 16:32.490
Uh, uh, sir, there may
be a bright side.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.325
There's never a bright side.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.828
SMITHERS (chuckles):
<i>He's almost mine.</i>

16:42.167 --> 16:44.769
Yes, you've torn
that up, all right.

16:44.771 --> 16:46.604
Father, I want to explain.

16:46.606 --> 16:49.607
I was a young woman
who wanted to see the world,

16:49.609 --> 16:51.943
and this kind man
has shown it to me.

16:51.945 --> 16:53.778
And stolen your heart.

16:53.780 --> 16:56.114
Eh, well, that's
what I do. Uh, sorry,

16:56.116 --> 16:58.182
but there ain't
no off switch for this.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.855
(laughs)
He has not stolen my heart.

17:03.857 --> 17:05.857
Wha?!

17:05.859 --> 17:09.360
Why has he made the ancient
tribal sound of confusion?

17:09.362 --> 17:12.130
I think he is a sweet,
sweet man.

17:12.132 --> 17:13.798
But when I kissed him
on the forehead,

17:13.800 --> 17:15.233
it was not
romantic.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.402
More like when
Snow White kissed Dopey.

17:17.404 --> 17:20.738
Oh, no, no, not
this comparison again.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.241
I'm sorry, Moe.
I don't love you.

17:23.243 --> 17:26.244
But I really like you.

17:26.246 --> 17:28.146
Well, daughter, even though
you have done nothing

17:28.148 --> 17:30.915
seriously wrong, first
I will tear this contract

17:30.917 --> 17:33.251
one more time.
(grunts)

17:33.253 --> 17:36.087
And as for you,
your punishment will be...

17:36.089 --> 17:38.423
Uh, may I speak
to you, Majesty,

17:38.425 --> 17:40.091
father to father?

17:40.093 --> 17:43.261
A woman has allowed you
to sire her children?

17:43.263 --> 17:45.930
There was beer involved.
I have two daughters.

17:45.932 --> 17:48.933
And I've learned you have to
let them go their own way.

17:48.935 --> 17:51.002
Even the one-year-old.

17:52.271 --> 17:54.272
Majesty.

17:54.274 --> 17:57.442
And the older one, I can't
tell her what to do.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.444
And she's only 12.
Eight.

17:59.446 --> 18:01.345
See what I mean?
Always an argument.

18:03.849 --> 18:05.783
But the thing you
have to remember is

18:05.785 --> 18:07.952
that you have to let
them be who they are

18:07.954 --> 18:09.620
because you love them.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.022
I am not convinced.

18:11.024 --> 18:14.425
Uh, because you
want them to grow.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.094
Still not convinced.

18:16.096 --> 18:19.197
And because you can't
strangle a girl.

18:19.199 --> 18:20.932
That makes sense.

18:20.934 --> 18:23.034
Oh...
Come here, daughter.

18:23.036 --> 18:24.702
Oh, father.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.804
Little girl, let me
give you some advice.

18:26.806 --> 18:29.707
Never dream big, because
it will blow up in your face.

18:29.709 --> 18:30.975
You're talking to the girl

18:30.977 --> 18:32.810
who wants a career in jazz.

18:32.812 --> 18:35.113
Oh, poor thing.

18:35.115 --> 18:37.148
So the good king's
cheap uranium will

18:37.150 --> 18:39.283
allow me to sell you
expensive nuclear power.

18:39.285 --> 18:40.985
Everyone wins.

18:40.987 --> 18:42.320
Yes, yes. Princess.

18:42.322 --> 18:45.123
Can you tell us about
the man you kissed?

18:45.125 --> 18:46.824
MOE:
Uh, yeah, I'll field that.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.993
Uh, yesterday,
a local man

18:48.995 --> 18:51.662
"may or may not"
have given a tour

18:51.664 --> 18:54.665
to a certain princess,
who, uh, one assumes,

18:54.667 --> 18:56.667
turned all his thoughts
of revenge

18:56.669 --> 18:59.103
to love and then
love to respect.

18:59.105 --> 19:01.139
And yesterday,
a certain princess

19:01.141 --> 19:03.774
may or may not have
seen much of your world

19:03.776 --> 19:05.309
with a certain man,

19:05.311 --> 19:08.446
and she certainly
might be eternally grateful.

19:08.448 --> 19:11.916
Oh, this is vague stuff.
Vague stuff!

19:14.520 --> 19:17.088
I did not think this through.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.024
Moe, before I left,

19:20.026 --> 19:22.093
I just wanted to give
you these examples

19:22.095 --> 19:26.097
of our most beloved, albeit
depressing, literature.

19:26.099 --> 19:28.432
Ah, some nice
bedtime readin'.

19:28.434 --> 19:29.934
Fun premise.

19:29.936 --> 19:32.436
I'm laughing already.

19:32.438 --> 19:34.505
Really not
cheerin' me up here,

19:34.507 --> 19:36.607
but, uh, let me
offer you the only literature

19:36.609 --> 19:39.110
in this bar-- sure
works for me, though.

19:39.112 --> 19:40.945
This coaster.

19:40.947 --> 19:43.014
I will treasure it.

19:48.687 --> 19:50.621
Well, I guess
you'll pine forever

19:50.623 --> 19:52.290
for a man who doesn't care,

19:52.292 --> 19:54.959
while I just grow old
here in this bar.

19:54.961 --> 19:57.428
Yeah. Here's to
suffering in silence.

20:01.466 --> 20:03.201
Oh.

20:05.304 --> 20:08.973
Mm. Can't wait to see those
numbers hanging from my rafters.

20:10.909 --> 20:13.578
(sighs)
I can't believe it's been

20:13.580 --> 20:15.413
three years since Smithers left.

20:15.415 --> 20:17.415
Man, have I been aging badly.

20:17.417 --> 20:20.918
But I guess I can finally
wash this forehead.

20:20.920 --> 20:23.321
Oh, divine.

20:28.093 --> 20:30.761
(doorbell ringing)

20:30.763 --> 20:32.597
Oh, God, what do you want?

20:32.599 --> 20:34.599
Well, neighbor, now that
your streak of rum luck

20:34.601 --> 20:37.268
is at its end,
I have a favor to ask.

20:37.270 --> 20:38.736
It involves charity.

20:40.606 --> 20:42.940
I've set up
the Virgin Earth Challenge,

20:42.942 --> 20:44.609
a $25 million prize

20:44.611 --> 20:46.277
