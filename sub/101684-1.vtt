00:03.625 --> 00:07.038
In 1945 the second world war
came to an end.

00:08.458 --> 00:12.827
The German reich and the Japanese empire
were defeated by the allied forces.

00:13.708 --> 00:16.165
In front of us is Germany,

00:16.332 --> 00:18.824
within us marches Ghana.

00:19.125 --> 00:22.492
The German Nazi leader Adolf Hitler
committed suicide,

00:23.000 --> 00:28.415
while Japanese military leader hideki tojo was
sentenced to death by a military tribunal.

00:28.833 --> 00:32.200
Or at least that is what was
written in the history books.

00:38.833 --> 00:42.655
In reality, Hitler and tojo
fled by submarine to Ghana,

00:43.167 --> 00:45.203
where they are hiding to this day.

00:55.958 --> 00:58.290
And it all shall be mine.

01:03.292 --> 01:09.162
Among them also Hitler's most trusted
accomplice, horse-man goering.

01:09.458 --> 01:11.369
I am horse-man goering.

01:11.542 --> 01:13.373
No body can defeat goering.

01:14.125 --> 01:17.242
They are raising hell in
their local communities and

01:17.542 --> 01:23.162
smash everything and everyone in their way
with the superior Japanese karate skills.

01:27.625 --> 01:28.705
Whazz up?

01:30.000 --> 01:31.786
Goering! Back off!

01:42.667 --> 01:44.749
Thanks to the intense karate training,

01:45.083 --> 01:47.290
and their Arian superpowers,

01:47.458 --> 01:49.870
they managed to reverse their aging process

01:50.042 --> 01:51.248
and they are stronger and more

01:51.417 --> 01:52.953
Arian than ever before.

01:58.625 --> 01:59.625
Hitler!

02:00.167 --> 02:02.249
We will give you all that you need.

02:03.542 --> 02:05.658
That's only thing we need from you.

02:06.125 --> 02:07.911
Please provide us with ladies.

02:08.833 --> 02:10.323
Beautiful ladies like these.

02:12.208 --> 02:15.951
Hitler offers the local riches,
alcohol and women.

02:18.417 --> 02:21.250
But in reality he is brainwashing them

02:21.542 --> 02:25.080
with a spell of the magical "blutfahneâ,
or blood flag.

02:28.333 --> 02:29.869
The new axis powers,

02:30.208 --> 02:34.577
Germany, Japan and Ghana
have gathered a powerful army

02:35.000 --> 02:37.958
calling themselves the ghan-arians.

02:39.125 --> 02:42.162
This time without Italy,
because they suck at war.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.572
Nobody is safe from the spell
of the magical blutfahne.

02:51.208 --> 02:52.744
And before you know it,

02:53.375 --> 02:57.414
your father, your mother,
your brother, your sister,

02:58.250 --> 03:01.367
might have already become a ghan-Arian...

03:01.917 --> 03:04.249
Mindless foot soldiers

03:04.542 --> 03:09.241
whose sole mission is to create
a new joined kingdom of Hitler's 4th reich

03:09.667 --> 03:11.874
and tojo"s new Japanese empire.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.241
Will anybody be able to stop them?

03:18.542 --> 03:22.490
Or will Hitler and tojo finally
be able to conquer the world?

03:23.083 --> 03:26.200
With their African kung fu Nazis!

03:37.417 --> 03:38.907
Here he comes now! Lookin' good!

03:39.083 --> 03:41.745
Hey addae, whaddup whaddup whaddup?

03:46.333 --> 03:47.664
Addae, ma man!

03:51.708 --> 03:53.994
Addae! Whaddup bro?

04:14.625 --> 04:16.035
I miss you, baby.

04:17.666 --> 04:19.827
You are looking so good.

04:20.250 --> 04:21.456
All for you. But...

04:22.458 --> 04:24.414
Don't forget our date tonight.

04:24.792 --> 04:25.872
Of course, Eva.

04:26.250 --> 04:28.457
I can't forget that. And I can't wait.

04:28.708 --> 04:29.993
You are such a darling.

04:32.708 --> 04:33.948
So happy.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.911
I've got ready for training now though...

04:37.333 --> 04:39.824
- Oh no.
- Yes.

04:40.333 --> 04:42.369
- See you later.
- Ok

04:42.833 --> 04:43.948
see you soon.

04:44.375 --> 04:45.455
Take care.

05:00.125 --> 05:01.125
Addae!

05:02.292 --> 05:06.331
How's your kung fu training coming along?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.661
Addae...

06:09.458 --> 06:10.493
You're late again!

06:12.167 --> 06:15.910
How do you ever expect to improve,
when you are not serious about training?

06:17.125 --> 06:18.160
I am sorry, master.

06:20.250 --> 06:21.285
You are sorry?

06:28.333 --> 06:31.905
As usual when you're late,
10 minutes horse stance!

06:48.500 --> 06:49.785
Go down, go down!

07:00.042 --> 07:01.282
Now, as you all know,

07:03.917 --> 07:05.873
there will be a great tournament.

07:09.417 --> 07:13.080
And I expect everyone of you
to be at your best.

07:13.708 --> 07:15.790
I expect you to fight with pride.

07:16.167 --> 07:19.455
And bring honor to our
shadow snake school.

07:20.125 --> 07:21.125
Remember!

07:21.458 --> 07:26.031
There is no kung fu style that can beat
our shadow snake school.

07:26.583 --> 07:27.583
Yes, master!

07:28.750 --> 07:29.865
And as always,

07:32.083 --> 07:35.871
akante will represent our school
for the tournament.

07:36.875 --> 07:39.662
And I will give the opportunity
to another student,

07:40.000 --> 07:43.163
who will also represent us
in the tournament.

07:43.667 --> 07:45.908
Me, master! Please choose me!

07:46.125 --> 07:47.125
Be silent!

07:48.833 --> 07:54.203
The one who impresses me the most will be
the second fighter for the tournament.

07:54.708 --> 07:58.576
And for you, addae,
you did not impress me today.

07:59.500 --> 08:03.163
I will announce the second fighter
by the close of the day.

08:04.125 --> 08:05.581
- Dispatch!
- Yes, master!

08:50.833 --> 08:52.619
Now, assemble! Everyone!

09:03.625 --> 09:05.035
Abeeku, step forward!

09:11.250 --> 09:14.162
You will represent our second fighter
at the tournament.

09:17.333 --> 09:18.573
Thank you, master.

09:19.417 --> 09:22.864
It is a great honor.
I will not disappoint you.

09:24.833 --> 09:27.074
- Join the queue.
- Thank you, master.

09:29.375 --> 09:30.455
Now you can dismiss.

09:36.542 --> 09:39.158
I believe master would have chosen you.

09:39.417 --> 09:41.624
You just have to be more disciplined.

09:41.833 --> 09:44.370
Otherwise you can never get to my level.

09:46.750 --> 09:50.117
Anyway, have you heard about
this new tournament?

09:50.833 --> 09:53.245
It's from a man called Adolf Hitler.

09:54.083 --> 09:56.039
Hitler... funny name, right?

09:57.917 --> 10:00.875
They call themselves the ghan-arians.

10:01.875 --> 10:03.536
- Akante.
- What?

10:03.875 --> 10:06.116
I don't know why master
is doing this to me.

10:07.417 --> 10:09.373
You know, kung fu is all I have.

10:11.458 --> 10:14.495
I thought master will
finially let me represent.

10:14.833 --> 10:16.539
Represent what?

10:16.833 --> 10:17.993
Cheer up my man.

10:18.417 --> 10:22.365
You've got the most beautiful
girl in town and that is Eva.

10:23.292 --> 10:26.739
You know what? I'll easily give up my spot
in the tournament

10:26.917 --> 10:28.623
so that I can have a date with her.

10:30.375 --> 10:33.367
No wait... I'd rather kick some ass.

10:35.250 --> 10:36.990
That's my boy. Cheer up, man.

10:39.083 --> 10:44.783
The ghan-arians do not even practice
Chinese kung fu.

10:45.000 --> 10:47.241
They practice Japanese karate.

10:47.958 --> 10:49.914
It's gonna be an easy win.

11:11.625 --> 11:14.241
I think you've had enough already!
What's wrong with you.

11:16.125 --> 11:18.616
I was hoping to have a
nice evening with you...

11:19.333 --> 11:20.573
The master.

11:21.542 --> 11:23.373
Again he didn't choose me.

11:25.208 --> 11:29.827
When will he finally give me the chance
to represent our school? When?

11:30.000 --> 11:31.706
Spare me with your whining addae!

11:32.583 --> 11:34.790
What is it with that dumb kung fu anyway?

11:35.917 --> 11:37.282
I love you, addae.

11:38.625 --> 11:41.287
But it is time you get a job for a change.

11:41.750 --> 11:43.832
Now let me tell you one secret.

11:44.042 --> 11:48.991
My father would never alloe me to marry
a loser like you!

11:49.250 --> 11:51.741
Please. You have to understand.

11:53.125 --> 11:57.243
If I can make a name for myself
in the martial arts world,

11:58.125 --> 11:59.911
I'll be rich and famous.

12:00.667 --> 12:03.830
You'll never have to worry
about a thing anymore.

12:04.958 --> 12:08.155
This is the perfect
chance for me, you know?

12:09.625 --> 12:11.786
It's going to be an easy tournament.

12:13.208 --> 12:16.655
It's by some guys who call
themselves ghan-arians.

12:17.417 --> 12:21.660
They don't even practice kung fu,
but Japanese karate.

12:26.958 --> 12:29.950
- Ghan-arians! Si!
- Ka!

12:32.250 --> 12:36.118
We have seized the power in Ghana.

12:36.417 --> 12:40.239
Now it's time to assimilate
the Ghanaian people.

12:41.208 --> 12:46.157
We have gathered here today
to swear in two new comrades,

12:46.375 --> 12:49.993
into our exclusive circle of ghan-arians.

12:50.417 --> 12:53.989
Only the best of the best can join us

12:54.208 --> 12:58.747
to fight for the advent of the 4th reich!

12:59.250 --> 13:01.161
So

13:02.583 --> 13:08.203
Now they shall swear the oath
to our beloved blutfahne.

13:13.792 --> 13:19.992
One people, one reich, one leader.

13:22.583 --> 13:25.575
You got dat right.

13:33.833 --> 13:38.782
For leader, reich and fatherland.

13:39.042 --> 13:40.202
Do you swear?

13:41.750 --> 13:43.456
Yes, my fuherer!

13:48.042 --> 13:53.207
In front of us is Ghana.
Within us marches Ghana.

13:53.542 --> 13:56.784
Marching is cool.

13:58.292 --> 14:02.114
Welcome our two new comrades
my dear Ghana-arians.

14:02.583 --> 14:09.204
Are you two ready to fight
for the advent of the 4th German reich

14:09.958 --> 14:13.576
and the new Japanese empire?

14:15.625 --> 14:18.947
Ghana-arians, now to a
completely different topic.

14:19.458 --> 14:26.785
As you all know, our great Ghana-Arian
tournament will start very soon.

14:27.875 --> 14:34.280
Regarding this, a few words from
our axis partner hideki tojo.

14:36.167 --> 14:38.749
Greetings.
A few remarks regarding

14:38.917 --> 14:41.408
the upcoming martial arts
tournament.

14:41.667 --> 14:45.330
No need to show any mercy
towards your opponents.

14:45.792 --> 14:48.909
Just exterminate
everyone in your way.

14:49.083 --> 14:51.540
Every fight, shall be fought
to the death.

14:53.083 --> 14:55.415
Chinese kung fu is crap.

14:56.708 --> 14:59.745
Japanese karate is the only true
martial art.

15:01.250 --> 15:05.698
Behold the beauty of Japan!
Hail the emperor of Japan!

15:10.708 --> 15:16.988
Tomorrow, we shall go out and spread
the word of Japan's beauty

15:17.375 --> 15:21.914
and recruit more soldiers for the
Japanese emperor and the German reich.

15:22.125 --> 15:23.125
Dat's sit!

15:23.667 --> 15:25.623
- Si!
- Ka!

15:26.833 --> 15:33.659
One... two...
One... two... stop!

15:37.125 --> 15:45.125
You may give me all your money for our
tournament and the emperor.

15:51.333 --> 15:56.407
One... two... one... two... stop!

16:02.417 --> 16:07.161
Mere woman, money out, for our
tournament and the emperor. Please.

16:07.542 --> 16:13.242
My money? Hell nah!
Get outta here!

16:13.667 --> 16:17.410
Oh, and hang up
this commercial for our tournament.

16:17.667 --> 16:21.580
You gotta be joking!

16:22.292 --> 16:23.292
One.

16:23.500 --> 16:25.957
Take this crap back.

16:26.125 --> 16:26.614
Two.

16:26.792 --> 16:27.851
I've had it with you China-man!

16:27.875 --> 16:28.705
Pay!

16:28.875 --> 16:30.581
Hey! Hey! Easy there China-man!

16:49.958 --> 16:52.620
One! Two! One! Two!

16:55.625 --> 16:58.162
One! Two! One! Two!

16:59.542 --> 17:03.239
One! Two! One! Two!

17:03.958 --> 17:04.958
Stop!

17:06.625 --> 17:08.911
Hey, my lady!

17:09.083 --> 17:10.573
You are very pretty.

17:11.333 --> 17:12.539
Give me a kiss!

17:17.250 --> 17:18.250
What is that?

17:18.958 --> 17:20.877
How dare you reject me woman!

17:21.958 --> 17:24.950
Let's have a little chat over there,
in this dark alley...

17:34.042 --> 17:36.374
Eva, you don't have to worry.

17:37.333 --> 17:40.746
He is an Asian. Even if he goes for it,
you won't feel a thing.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.740
What did you just say?

17:42.958 --> 17:45.290
Let me show you something...
In my pants...

17:52.375 --> 17:54.787
Hey addae! Brother!

17:55.750 --> 17:56.910
What are you doing?

17:57.708 --> 17:59.388
While you are sitting here enjoying adonko

17:59.583 --> 18:01.665
while the ghan-arians are
demolishing our school.

18:06.042 --> 18:07.578
What do you want, man?

18:08.458 --> 18:10.369
Can't you see I am busy?

18:11.083 --> 18:13.574
What the hell happened to you anyway?

18:15.292 --> 18:17.203
The ghan-arians have come to our school.

18:18.125 --> 18:19.285
It is terrible.

18:21.208 --> 18:27.329
They say if we don't pay them a tribute
every month to the Japanese emperor,

18:27.583 --> 18:30.290
they will exterminate us.

18:33.500 --> 18:35.286
Why don't you stop them?

18:36.417 --> 18:38.032
Isn't master there?

18:39.875 --> 18:42.833
And your kung fu is very great too.

18:44.833 --> 18:46.118
What's happening?

18:51.208 --> 18:52.493
They are too good.

18:53.958 --> 18:55.289
Too good?

18:55.583 --> 18:56.583
Yes.

18:57.167 --> 19:01.831
So we need every man... we must stop them.

19:02.375 --> 19:05.242
We must. We must go now. Please.

19:05.625 --> 19:09.197
- You mean too good?
- We must go now.

20:23.417 --> 20:24.577
Stop right there!

21:19.792 --> 21:21.748
No! Master!

21:22.542 --> 21:23.702
You, devil!

21:25.792 --> 21:26.792
You!

21:27.625 --> 21:28.660
I'll kill you!

21:35.167 --> 21:37.123
You show great fighting spirit.

21:38.375 --> 21:41.375
You would be a good soldier for the
emperor. But... you need to be punished.

22:02.917 --> 22:04.532
Master!

23:00.125 --> 23:07.748
We have gathered here today to pay our
last respect to our dear master.

23:08.917 --> 23:12.990
We fought a good fight in order
to save his nation.

23:13.708 --> 23:19.283
So we gathered here to show our
appreciation for being a good master.

23:19.708 --> 23:23.872
For it is written,
that a master dies by example.

23:24.083 --> 23:26.665
And our master was really de man.

23:27.333 --> 23:30.245
The lord gave and the lord has taken away.

23:40.292 --> 23:43.329
For as much as we praise almighty god,

23:44.042 --> 23:47.455
of his great mercy to take onto himself

23:47.833 --> 23:54.864
the soul of dear master,
shadow snake master, the departed one.

23:55.917 --> 23:57.032
Earth to the earth.

23:57.917 --> 23:59.453
Ashes to the ashes.

24:00.000 --> 24:01.331
And dust to the dust.

24:03.083 --> 24:05.995
Be with earth now and forever more. Amen.

24:23.583 --> 24:26.199
Just take it easy. Right?

24:32.125 --> 24:33.661
Where is Eva?

24:34.458 --> 24:36.824
I haven't seen her. Where is she?

24:40.500 --> 24:41.660
I don't know.

24:45.375 --> 24:46.410
Why don't you...

24:46.833 --> 24:49.370
I couldn't get hold of her for
the last few days.

24:49.792 --> 24:53.660
I guess, our wedding plans are on ice now.

24:56.250 --> 24:57.285
Sorry.

25:20.292 --> 25:23.659
Our master used to drive this type of car.

25:24.250 --> 25:25.990
It breaks my heart.

25:26.375 --> 25:28.741
These bastards will have to pay.

25:41.542 --> 25:44.864
Will you still take part in the
ghan-arians' martial arts tournament?

25:45.542 --> 25:46.873
Yes, I will.

25:49.250 --> 25:50.660
That will be suicide.

25:53.083 --> 25:55.039
I heard it is to the death.

25:56.417 --> 25:58.829
The Japanese karate is too strong.

26:02.333 --> 26:05.530
Our shadow snake kung fu style
won't stand a chance.

26:06.958 --> 26:08.073
I know, addae.

26:08.708 --> 26:10.198
But I have to try.

26:12.792 --> 26:14.953
I owe that to our master.

26:17.833 --> 26:19.414
My heart...

26:21.417 --> 26:23.874
My heart is burning addae!

26:34.458 --> 26:38.576
Join the ghan-arians. Accra - kaputt!

26:39.792 --> 26:42.454
Stalingrad - cheese wheel.

26:42.875 --> 26:45.332
Final victory is imminent.

26:45.792 --> 26:50.411
Join the ghan-arians. Kumasi - kaputt!

26:51.542 --> 26:54.158
Stalingrad - Ferris wheel.

26:54.750 --> 26:57.162
Give us four years time.

26:57.333 --> 26:59.039
Hello!

27:01.792 --> 27:04.124
I am buying the rice, as usual.

27:04.958 --> 27:06.539
Just one cup.

27:59.625 --> 28:03.618
Dj Adolf. Join the ghan-arians.

28:03.875 --> 28:07.743
Greetings fighters from around the world.

28:08.167 --> 28:11.705
Enlist to the great ghan-Arian tournament.

28:12.125 --> 28:15.913
Get rewarded from Hitler himself.

28:16.333 --> 28:20.201
Make your wishes become reality.

28:20.667 --> 28:24.330
Hitler makes your wish come true.

28:24.792 --> 28:27.829
Join the ghan-arians.

28:30.708 --> 28:33.199
A warm welcome to all fighters
from around the world,

28:33.542 --> 28:36.542
if you win our tournament, Hitler will
Grant you a wish, whatever it may be.

28:36.667 --> 28:38.707
Now a few words from our
beloved fuehrerin.

28:56.083 --> 28:58.574
Be hard as a greyhound doggy.

28:58.792 --> 29:00.953
Tough as a krupp iron bar.

29:01.292 --> 29:04.204
And fast as...

29:05.917 --> 29:07.578
Beef. I

29:08.542 --> 29:13.036
the next song shall be dedicated
to my new love...

29:13.417 --> 29:16.079
Eva braun.

29:17.708 --> 29:18.823
A tanned version.

29:33.250 --> 29:36.037
Three times si-ka for Eva braun,
the tanned version!

29:36.333 --> 29:39.655
- Si!
- Ka!

31:25.042 --> 31:26.282
You guys are still alive.

31:27.667 --> 31:29.783
You are here to enlist into our tournament?

31:32.167 --> 31:33.167
You shall see.

31:34.375 --> 31:35.785
Let me tell you something.

31:37.125 --> 31:39.741
Your shadow snake style is useless.

31:47.042 --> 31:48.042
Leave him.

31:48.958 --> 31:49.958
Leave him!

32:18.125 --> 32:19.285
Now come and fight.

32:20.000 --> 32:21.000
Hey!

32:21.750 --> 32:22.750
Stop!

32:24.792 --> 32:25.792
Who are you?

32:26.417 --> 32:29.614
You want to kill this little boy?

32:30.417 --> 32:31.452
I said who are you?

32:32.000 --> 32:34.707
I am a drinking master.

32:37.542 --> 32:38.748
Addae!

32:40.250 --> 32:41.831
Come on, boy.

33:18.917 --> 33:20.248
Coward, come on.

33:23.958 --> 33:25.414
I said come on.

33:26.833 --> 33:28.243
We shall meet again.

33:28.542 --> 33:29.542
And you!

33:30.833 --> 33:32.039
Meet me there.

33:33.292 --> 33:34.873
Only the strong can survive.

33:40.750 --> 33:44.197
Next time when you see a drinking master,

33:44.583 --> 33:46.244
you will pass by.

34:41.583 --> 34:43.197
Rise and shine.

34:44.583 --> 34:46.119
Where am I?

34:49.250 --> 34:50.364
Old guy...?

34:53.750 --> 34:56.366
You're welcome to my home.

34:57.042 --> 34:58.373
Thank you for yesterday.

34:59.583 --> 35:00.914
You saved my life.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.786
Who are you, old guy?

35:10.167 --> 35:12.123
Master akpeteshie.

35:14.292 --> 35:15.907
Because...

35:16.583 --> 35:19.245
I like akpeteshie.

35:27.833 --> 35:28.833
Master akpeteshie.

35:30.625 --> 35:33.662
Your style. It's fantastic.

35:34.583 --> 35:38.280
You could hold your own against
these ghan-arians and their karate.

35:40.458 --> 35:41.458
Please.

35:41.792 --> 35:43.248
Master. Teach me.

35:44.958 --> 35:46.073
Please.

35:53.125 --> 35:56.083
Well, that depends on you.

35:56.708 --> 36:02.032
I can see a fire burning in your heart.

36:02.917 --> 36:05.875
But is your heart in the right spot?

36:07.375 --> 36:09.866
The training will be hard.

36:10.333 --> 36:13.655
And I expect iron discipline.

36:14.167 --> 36:17.409
If you oversleep or complain,

36:17.625 --> 36:18.831
I will throw you out.

36:19.500 --> 36:26.121
This will be harder than anything
you have ever experienced before.

36:26.375 --> 36:28.081
Are you ready now?

36:28.583 --> 36:29.583
Yes, master.

36:30.333 --> 36:31.698
I will not disappoint you.

36:32.250 --> 36:33.706
Let's begin.

36:35.583 --> 36:38.450
I call it, the moon shine style.

36:38.667 --> 36:41.454
Here, drink this.

36:45.417 --> 36:46.417
Take it.

36:53.167 --> 36:54.167
Take it.

37:02.917 --> 37:06.580
This is my secret, akpeteshie.

37:07.625 --> 37:08.625
Watch me.

38:56.167 --> 38:59.204
I think you are ready now to move on.

38:59.417 --> 39:01.328
What do you mean by move on, master?

39:02.250 --> 39:05.367
Move on to learn the next techniques.

39:07.417 --> 39:09.408
What techniques, master?

39:10.792 --> 39:17.038
Well, you can't win the tournament
just with the moon shine style.

39:17.333 --> 39:20.245
It works against karate.

39:20.708 --> 39:25.873
But not against goering's iron shirt style.

39:25.875 --> 39:27.206
You have to move on.

39:27.375 --> 39:30.867
You have to look for three-finger-Joe.

39:31.458 --> 39:37.454
He lives on the hill of the dead,
there you will find three-finger-Joe.

40:22.750 --> 40:24.286
My, my name is addae.

40:26.708 --> 40:29.120
Master akpeteshie sent me.

40:29.917 --> 40:34.707
He said you can train me for the great
ghan-Arian martial arts tournament.

40:36.708 --> 40:37.788
Please.

40:38.500 --> 40:40.912
Please master, teach me.

40:54.500 --> 40:59.073
I am the three-finger-Joe.

41:01.250 --> 41:06.916
My technique only work for three fingers'.

41:07.792 --> 41:11.990
Before you can learn my technique,
I chop off your hands.

41:13.542 --> 41:15.624
I will chop chop your hands.

41:19.875 --> 41:21.285
Chop fingers!

41:24.792 --> 41:28.705
No, no, no please!

41:35.625 --> 41:37.206
You are the chosen one.

41:55.250 --> 42:00.199
The priestess told me...

42:02.500 --> 42:08.245
A man with three fingers will
come to me to teach him.

42:10.292 --> 42:13.705
He is the man who will break
the spell of the blood flag.

42:15.042 --> 42:17.533
I hate the blood flag.

42:18.667 --> 42:20.953
I hate the ghan-arians.

42:23.083 --> 42:25.825
And I hate Hitler.

42:30.083 --> 42:31.414
What an honor.

42:32.792 --> 42:34.623
You are the chosen one.

42:36.833 --> 42:38.698
I bow before you.

44:26.958 --> 44:27.958
Break the nut.

44:28.417 --> 44:29.748
You are such a darling.

44:32.333 --> 44:34.574
That a master dies by example...

44:37.708 --> 44:38.708
Break the nut.

44:46.042 --> 44:47.042
Good.

44:48.333 --> 44:50.699
But there is one more step.

44:51.875 --> 44:53.661
You have to go to the priestess.

44:54.500 --> 44:59.415
She will teach you how to break
the spell of the blood flag.

45:00.458 --> 45:03.416
But, how can I find the priestess?

45:04.333 --> 45:05.368
Don't worry.

45:06.125 --> 45:07.615
You are the chosen one.

45:08.500 --> 45:10.331
The priestess will find you.

45:14.083 --> 45:15.118
Now, go!

45:17.042 --> 45:18.042
Gol

45:20.292 --> 45:21.292
gol

46:24.042 --> 46:25.077
Chosen one.

46:27.083 --> 46:28.448
Chosen one.

46:30.625 --> 46:31.705
Chosen one.

46:33.917 --> 46:35.327
Wake up.

46:38.708 --> 46:39.993
Are you the priestess?

46:41.000 --> 46:42.911
Yes, chosen one.

46:44.125 --> 46:45.125
Come.

46:51.000 --> 46:52.000
Come.

47:02.500 --> 47:06.243
Oooooooo00000h yes.
Very very good.

47:07.250 --> 47:09.115
Them vanilla pancakes. Love 'em.

47:11.125 --> 47:13.411
You hungry? I'm still a
bit hungey honestly.

47:14.917 --> 47:16.248
Don't have anything here.

47:16.583 --> 47:17.789
Sorry, ate it all earlier.

47:18.375 --> 47:19.490
Want some tea?

47:20.417 --> 47:21.452
The pancakes are gone.

47:21.625 --> 47:23.559
Oh yeah, what about that Adolf
guy by the way? Adolf himmler?

47:23.583 --> 47:26.541
What is it with you and that
himmler guy? I mean Hitler.

47:31.667 --> 47:35.535
He brainwashes people with a spell
of the so called blood flag... hold on.

47:35.917 --> 47:38.954
I will teach you a spell to break
the spell of the blood flag.

47:40.000 --> 47:41.000
Hold on a sec...

47:48.917 --> 47:53.581
This spell will protect you
from the blood flag.

47:53.833 --> 47:54.993
Take this.

48:01.542 --> 48:02.542
Come here.

48:07.542 --> 48:14.948
Das how you burn dat
dayum blood flags.

48:17.542 --> 48:22.536
The power of this hairband
together with the words I just told you

48:22.833 --> 48:26.200
will break the spell of
the dreaded blood flag.

48:26.458 --> 48:32.203
And eliminate the power Hitler
has over the ghan-arians.

48:32.542 --> 48:35.204
You are ready now, chosen one.

48:35.417 --> 48:41.413
Meditate now... and never forget the words
I just told you!

48:42.458 --> 48:43.458
Go.

48:44.958 --> 48:48.405
Now go to
the tournament. Exterminate Hitler!

48:51.750 --> 48:53.490
Exterminate Hitler!

49:35.833 --> 49:39.951
I will crush you like a bug.

49:56.417 --> 49:58.783
Ladies and gentleman!

49:59.750 --> 50:01.866
Dear ghan-arians.

50:03.083 --> 50:05.324
Awarm welcome to y'all.

50:05.500 --> 50:08.697
Germany is cool.

50:09.750 --> 50:11.490

Cup of coffee, yeah... cup of coffee in the
big time, that's what you are.

55:28.708 --> 55:35.034
You're just a grain of sand,
while I'm the whole desert, yeah!

55:35.250 --> 55:36.250
Who's the man?

55:36.292 --> 55:37.748
You are Mr. machismo.

55:37.917 --> 55:40.909
Yeah... rip it off machismo girls!

55:50.417 --> 55:53.159

59:53.375 --> 59:57.914

Splendid Dr. adonko-man!

01:00:16.208 --> 01:00:19.996
We may have lost one of
our ghan-Arian comrades...

01:00:20.458 --> 01:00:25.782
But now the shadow snake fools
have to kill each other.

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:31.580
Hey, brother.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:38.121
I believe the next fight
is very easy for us.

01:00:39.292 --> 01:00:40.292
You, okay?

01:00:40.625 --> 01:00:43.367
- Certainly!
- Cheers.

01:00:55.208 --> 01:00:56.208
Sorry.

01:01:03.875 --> 01:01:08.448
Addae, it looks like we have
to fight each other next.

01:01:13.208 --> 01:01:14.823
I just don't know if I can.

01:01:15.875 --> 01:01:17.490
We must, akante.

01:01:18.542 --> 01:01:19.577
We must.

01:01:20.417 --> 01:01:22.373
We have to avenge our master's death.

01:01:23.208 --> 01:01:25.699
We are the only chance these people have.

01:01:26.167 --> 01:01:30.206
To get rid of this cancer,
that are the ghan-arians.

01:01:31.417 --> 01:01:32.623
You are right.

01:01:34.375 --> 01:01:36.036
But I just can't.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.788
You know, we have to fight to the death.

01:01:43.417 --> 01:01:44.623
If we are there,

01:01:45.917 --> 01:01:47.373
just make it quick.

01:02:14.833 --> 01:02:16.539
Fight!

01:03:08.708 --> 01:03:13.782
I don't know if I should kill
you or marry you.

01:03:14.708 --> 01:03:19.281
Well, I guess I will kill you.

01:04:07.833 --> 01:04:15.035
Winner: Reichsmarschall goering.

01:04:32.792 --> 01:04:33.952
Fight!

01:04:50.167 --> 01:04:52.283
I wish it would have never come to that.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:54.956
We have to do what has to be done.

01:04:57.250 --> 01:04:59.115
May the best man win.

01:05:23.042 --> 01:05:25.499
Why are you not fighting, addae?

01:05:27.417 --> 01:05:29.578
This is not helping anyone.

01:05:31.625 --> 01:05:33.161
You must not hold back.

01:05:35.792 --> 01:05:37.282
You have to fight.

01:05:39.458 --> 01:05:40.458
Addae.

01:05:42.292 --> 01:05:45.534
I believe one of us can win the finals.

01:05:46.167 --> 01:05:49.330
So let's do this for the
sake of our master.

01:05:50.208 --> 01:05:52.415
Do it for the sake of our town.

01:05:57.208 --> 01:05:58.948
- I just can't.
- Addae!

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:01.500
Start fighting!

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:52.000
I can't.

01:07:53.333 --> 01:07:54.618
I can't kill you.

01:07:56.833 --> 01:07:58.198
You're my friend!

01:07:58.667 --> 01:07:59.782
My brother!

01:08:01.958 --> 01:08:03.448
I can't kill you...

01:08:58.082 --> 01:09:05.238
Winner: Addae.

01:09:45.625 --> 01:09:46.831
Eva.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.115
Eva, wait.

01:09:50.750 --> 01:09:52.411
It's me, addae.

01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.787
My name is Eva, the tanned one,
have we met before?

01:09:57.917 --> 01:09:59.032
Have we met before?

01:10:00.167 --> 01:10:01.202
Of course, we have.

01:10:03.167 --> 01:10:04.452
Eva, I love you.

01:10:04.958 --> 01:10:06.289
Don't you remember?

01:10:11.625 --> 01:10:14.537
Excuse me, I started feeling sick
when you said the name... just Eva.

01:10:19.917 --> 01:10:20.997
Eval

01:10:24.417 --> 01:10:25.827
I love you...

01:11:01.458 --> 01:11:06.202
In then blue corner:

01:11:07.167 --> 01:11:12.992
Addae.

01:11:16.083 --> 01:11:20.531
In the red corner:

01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:28.781
Reichsashamona goering.

01:11:35.542 --> 01:11:36.542
Fight!

01:12:23.458 --> 01:12:25.369
Everybody has a plan.

01:12:26.458 --> 01:12:28.369
Until you get hit.

01:12:29.208 --> 01:12:33.702
I told you.
Your shadow snake style is useless.

01:12:34.292 --> 01:12:38.831
Now, prepare to be re-united
with your friend.

01:13:19.833 --> 01:13:20.833
Break the nut!

01:13:41.833 --> 01:13:44.996
Congratulations.
But unfortunately, due to a slight...

01:13:47.292 --> 01:13:51.490
Rules violation, the last fight shall
be counted as a draw.

01:13:52.458 --> 01:13:56.371
But, you are not the winner just yet!

01:13:56.625 --> 01:13:57.705
Tojo!

01:14:03.208 --> 01:14:10.410
How can you call yourself the winner if
you haven't beaten our best man just yet?

01:14:10.833 --> 01:14:16.624
In him burns the flame
of the beauty of Japan!

01:14:20.083 --> 01:14:22.039
Jawoll! I challenge you to a fight!

01:14:23.167 --> 01:14:25.783
You're not the real winner of this
tournament without beating me!

01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:28.582
Do you accept?

01:14:29.292 --> 01:14:30.372
I accept!

01:14:31.042 --> 01:14:32.873
So shall be it!

01:14:33.167 --> 01:14:37.991
The final fight should be
hideki tojo of the ghan-arians

01:14:38.708 --> 01:14:44.704
versus addae of the shadow snake school.

01:14:45.625 --> 01:14:48.867
Gentleman! Get ready to fight!

01:14:49.958 --> 01:14:52.825
Boys! Take the body away!

01:15:46.458 --> 01:15:50.155
Dr. Hitler, how would you like me
to exterminate him?

01:15:52.250 --> 01:15:55.697
This is my secret, akpeteshie.

01:15:58.250 --> 01:16:00.206
No! Master!

01:16:02.292 --> 01:16:03.577
Eva, I love you!

01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:31.786
Trying to numb your pain?

01:16:33.583 --> 01:16:35.539
I'll show you pain!

01:16:37.625 --> 01:16:38.625
Come on!

01:17:20.708 --> 01:17:22.198
I won the tournament.

01:17:23.208 --> 01:17:26.371
Now I want you to Grant me my wish.

01:17:28.042 --> 01:17:30.909
So, what shall your wish be?

01:17:31.708 --> 01:17:34.905
Shall it be women? Shall it be money?

01:17:35.833 --> 01:17:41.408
I can even make you my new
no.2 if you want.

01:17:42.000 --> 01:17:43.410
I don't want any of them.

01:17:44.708 --> 01:17:46.448
I want the blood flag.

01:17:47.083 --> 01:17:50.405
What? The blutfahne?

01:17:51.042 --> 01:17:56.491
A different choice would be
preferable, indeed.

01:17:56.667 --> 01:17:59.989
Now we gonna burn
dat dayum blood flag.

01:18:01.125 --> 01:18:04.913
No! Not the blood flag!

01:18:19.250 --> 01:18:20.615
Addae, take it!

01:20:37.958 --> 01:20:41.200
Welcome! Welcome to my shop!

01:20:53.333 --> 01:20:55.449
Are you doing great?

01:20:57.542 --> 01:20:59.518
I'm aight.
I'm glad we could bury the hatchet.

01:20:59.542 --> 01:21:01.578
- Tojo, we want some of this.
- Sure!

01:21:02.542 --> 01:21:03.702
Which do you want?

01:21:05.583 --> 01:21:07.665
With or without teeth?

01:21:07.958 --> 01:21:10.700
- 10 Ghana cedi.
- We want it.

01:21:25.542 --> 01:21:27.078
- Here you are.
- Thank you very much.

01:21:39.125 --> 01:21:43.243
Well, I guess my father was wrong

01:21:43.417 --> 01:21:45.999
and you are never a loser after all.

01:21:46.292 --> 01:21:48.248
Yeah, I am not a loser.

01:21:49.958 --> 01:21:53.121
And I am really glad everything is
back to normal.

01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:58.744
Once we settle down,
I will open my own kung fu school.

01:21:59.083 --> 01:22:03.907
I will strongly support you, because your
kung fu has saved us all!

01:22:04.583 --> 01:22:07.780
Something like the ghan-arians must
never happen again.

01:22:08.792 --> 01:22:09.952
Hey addae...

01:22:10.917 --> 01:22:12.327
- Si!
- Ka!
