01:31.990 --> 01:32.824
Daddy.

01:34.491 --> 01:35.358
Daddy, I'm scared.

01:35.360 --> 01:36.391
Benny.

01:36.393 --> 01:38.696
- He's coming!
- Benny!

01:53.511 --> 01:54.343
There's nothing.

01:54.345 --> 01:55.577
Look at this, won't you?

01:55.579 --> 01:56.779
Nothing.

01:56.781 --> 01:57.612
See?

01:57.614 --> 01:58.415
There's nothing.

01:59.817 --> 02:01.416
- Promise you...
- Benny, please stop it.

02:01.418 --> 02:02.851
There is no monster.

02:02.853 --> 02:04.352
Yes, there is!

02:04.354 --> 02:05.654
Benny, we've been talking
about it so many times.

02:05.656 --> 02:06.888
He's right outside!

02:06.890 --> 02:08.126
Just stop it.

02:09.327 --> 02:11.560
There's nothing to
be scared about.

02:18.602 --> 02:19.437
Benny!

02:20.972 --> 02:22.004
Benny!

02:26.109 --> 02:27.577
Benny!

02:28.912 --> 02:29.747
Benny!

04:29.866 --> 04:34.270
I was told you could
help me.

04:34.272 --> 04:35.737
I'm Dr. Mason.

04:35.739 --> 04:36.874
Who did you lose?

04:38.443 --> 04:39.277
My son.

04:41.412 --> 04:44.349
He had an accident
a few years ago.

04:47.018 --> 04:51.186
My wife couldn't
live with herself

04:51.188 --> 04:53.659
after that and now
they're both gone.

04:54.859 --> 04:57.727
And I'm trying, I try
to remember every day

04:57.729 --> 05:00.528
and it's getting
harder and harder.

05:02.200 --> 05:05.066
Like those dreams
that always end

05:05.068 --> 05:06.302
right before I can resolve them.

05:06.304 --> 05:10.706
I would give anything
to see my family again.

05:10.708 --> 05:14.744
I can't guarantee
you'll see your family.

05:14.746 --> 05:16.681
The tea works
differently for everyone.

05:18.415 --> 05:19.948
But I must warn you,

05:19.950 --> 05:21.585
don't stray too far.

05:22.753 --> 05:24.220
You can get trapped
on the other side

05:24.222 --> 05:25.857
like a fly on a web.

06:05.496 --> 06:07.730
You shouldn't be here.

06:07.732 --> 06:08.900
Who are you?

06:10.400 --> 06:11.235
Wait!

06:53.977 --> 06:55.477
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:55.479 --> 06:57.246
You're okay, you're okay, look
at me, look at me. You okay?

06:58.349 --> 06:59.480
What happened?

06:59.482 --> 07:00.715
We recorded remarkable
brain activity.

07:00.717 --> 07:01.917
You're not gonna
believe this, man.

07:01.919 --> 07:03.151
His heart rate is stabilizing.

07:03.153 --> 07:04.285
His blood pressure
is 110 over 70.

07:04.287 --> 07:05.220
He's gonna be okay.

07:05.222 --> 07:06.155
- Am I alright?
- Oh my god.

07:06.157 --> 07:07.292
You're good, you're good.

07:08.792 --> 07:09.627
Where is she?

07:11.929 --> 07:13.028
Whoa, whoa, okay, okay.

07:13.030 --> 07:13.996
Easy, easy.

07:16.867 --> 07:17.768
Whoa, whoa.

07:36.152 --> 07:37.222
Miss Sanchez?

07:39.789 --> 07:43.859
I'd like to talk to
you about your tea.

07:43.861 --> 07:45.460
There's sodas in the fridge.

07:45.462 --> 07:47.164
The sugar helps
with the headache.

07:56.806 --> 07:59.176
The girl in this
picture, I just saw her.

08:03.047 --> 08:04.015
What did you say?

08:09.152 --> 08:12.857
The girl in that
picture, this smaller one.

08:14.124 --> 08:15.658
I just saw her.

08:15.660 --> 08:16.661
Oh my god.

08:21.731 --> 08:24.134
That's my baby sister, Isabel.

08:26.336 --> 08:30.238
Miss Sanchez, something
in that mixture you gave me

08:30.240 --> 08:33.577
has a profound
mind-altering effect.

08:36.880 --> 08:39.884
I would like to analyze the
sample in a small trial.

08:41.719 --> 08:42.984
I can't.

08:42.986 --> 08:45.487
This is a passage
between two worlds

08:45.489 --> 08:47.423
not a recreational drug.

08:47.425 --> 08:48.891
It's sacred.

08:48.893 --> 08:51.830
Look it would be a small
trial with my own team

08:53.998 --> 08:56.332
and we'd have funding.

08:56.334 --> 08:59.404
Might help you with some
of these bills here.

09:03.541 --> 09:04.376
Excuse me.

09:07.644 --> 09:09.947
Just give me a call
if you change your mind.

09:12.016 --> 09:13.184
What do you have to lose?

09:29.466 --> 09:30.301
What'd she say?

09:34.238 --> 09:35.073
She'll do it.

09:36.474 --> 09:38.841
Can you get me Dr.
Weissman on the phone?

09:38.843 --> 09:39.678
Yeah.

09:41.177 --> 09:42.013
That's great.

09:43.180 --> 09:44.913
I mean, we could
conclusively prove

09:44.915 --> 09:46.818
that life exists after death.

11:18.843 --> 11:20.211
Wow, you weren't kidding.

11:22.046 --> 11:25.282
We're really excited to
be working with you on this.

11:28.051 --> 11:28.887
Thank you.

11:30.653 --> 11:31.755
How did you find it?

11:33.356 --> 11:34.191
Well.

11:37.661 --> 11:39.093
It's a long story.

11:39.095 --> 11:42.731
Apparently some silent
movie actor lived here once.

11:42.733 --> 11:44.933
What about the family
that you got it from?

11:44.935 --> 11:48.739
Obviously they didn't live
here long enough to restore it.

11:50.106 --> 11:51.575
I don't know much about them.

12:01.317 --> 12:03.285
Oh, shit.

12:03.287 --> 12:06.021
Serious Addams Family vibe.

12:06.023 --> 12:08.357
Maya, this is
Travis's brother, Shane.

12:08.359 --> 12:09.591
Hey, doc.

12:09.593 --> 12:11.392
Shane just got back
from shark diving.

12:11.394 --> 12:12.361
Cape Town.

12:12.363 --> 12:13.594
Great whites.

12:13.596 --> 12:14.496
Brave man.

12:14.498 --> 12:15.463
Travis?

12:15.465 --> 12:16.298
Yes.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.332
Can you take them?

12:17.334 --> 12:18.232
Put them down.

12:18.234 --> 12:19.468
Looks fool you.

12:19.470 --> 12:21.336
She went straight from
kindergarten to Harvard.

12:21.338 --> 12:22.570
This may surprise you to hear,

12:22.572 --> 12:24.238
but I'm really not
a rodent person.

12:24.240 --> 12:25.373
I will never understand you.

12:25.375 --> 12:26.942
Well, take a look around.

12:26.944 --> 12:27.843
Pick your bedrooms.

12:27.845 --> 12:29.911
First come, first serve.

12:29.913 --> 12:31.482
Main base is gonna be here.

12:32.449 --> 12:33.681
Hey, whoa, Trav.

12:33.683 --> 12:35.516
I think he meant the
people, don't ya think?

12:35.518 --> 12:36.818
Oh, I know.

12:36.820 --> 12:37.819
I'm gonna take 'em outside.

12:37.821 --> 12:39.288
Come on rodents.

12:39.290 --> 12:41.189
Let's go check out the
rest of this bad boy, huh?

12:41.191 --> 12:42.457
Dinner's at eight, guys.

12:42.459 --> 12:44.425
Then fasting the
rest of the night.

12:44.427 --> 12:46.295
Injections start
tomorrow at nine.

12:46.297 --> 12:47.728
Copy that.

12:47.730 --> 12:49.164
I wonder what the
listing price is

12:49.166 --> 12:51.201
for a mansion with
a history of murder?

12:52.369 --> 12:53.535
Is the pool
heated 'cause I feel

12:53.537 --> 12:54.803
like that might
cancel it out, right?

12:54.805 --> 12:56.939
Dude.

12:56.941 --> 12:58.073
I didn't see a pool.

12:58.075 --> 12:59.507
Yeah, here.

12:59.509 --> 13:01.209
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:01.211 --> 13:02.711
Water in it?

13:03.913 --> 13:05.814
So just put 'em on
that table right there.

13:05.816 --> 13:06.618
Alright.

13:09.052 --> 13:09.854
Hey, guys.

13:25.002 --> 13:26.200
So hungry.

13:26.202 --> 13:28.136
These are so good.

13:28.138 --> 13:29.203
The closest thing we
have to these back home

13:29.205 --> 13:31.640
are like those soggy microwave...

13:34.010 --> 13:35.445
- I love those.
- Oh my god.

13:37.681 --> 13:39.617
Mm, it was a long night.

13:41.951 --> 13:43.452
Hi.

13:43.454 --> 13:45.319
Sorry, just to walk in but
the front door was open.

13:45.321 --> 13:46.724
I feel underdressed.

13:47.758 --> 13:49.259
Didn't know you were coming.

13:50.426 --> 13:52.660
Janet said it was
still undecided.

13:52.662 --> 13:54.161
Yeah, it was last minute.

13:54.163 --> 13:56.365
Don't let me interrupt,
I'm just here to observe.

13:56.367 --> 13:58.666
Everyone, this
is Casey Blackburn.

13:58.668 --> 14:01.569
He's going to observe the trial
for the Milford Foundation.

14:01.571 --> 14:03.204
The Milford Foundation?

14:03.206 --> 14:04.272
Of Neuroscience.

14:04.274 --> 14:05.774
They fund all of our research.

14:05.776 --> 14:08.376
Scientifically speaking, we
are pushing boundaries here

14:08.378 --> 14:11.146
and so far Milford has
been nothing but supportive

14:11.148 --> 14:14.750
so let him do his job,
we do ours, right?

14:14.752 --> 14:15.820
Have a seat.

14:17.720 --> 14:18.753
Please meet my team.

14:18.755 --> 14:20.155
- This is...
- I'm actually familiar

14:20.157 --> 14:23.127
with everyone's files,
it was a long flight.

14:24.295 --> 14:27.963
Except for Miss Sanchez,
a surprising addition.

14:27.965 --> 14:30.232
Still trying to
understand the necessity

14:30.234 --> 14:32.467
of her involvement in
this scientific trial.

14:32.469 --> 14:34.435
Necessity of my involvement?

14:34.437 --> 14:36.604
He's off to a fabulous start.

14:36.606 --> 14:39.674
Miss Sanchez has access to
unique botanical compounds

14:39.676 --> 14:42.711
we have used to
create our serum so.

14:42.713 --> 14:44.378
You just seem pretty cavalier

14:44.380 --> 14:47.381
with an untested mind-altering
substance, Doctor.

14:47.383 --> 14:48.817
Okay.

14:48.819 --> 14:50.452
I mean, how sure
are you that it's

14:50.454 --> 14:51.453
not just gonna
get everyone high?

14:51.455 --> 14:53.755
How about 99%, actually?

14:53.757 --> 14:54.955
If we wanted to simply get high

14:54.957 --> 14:56.958
there are far cheaper
ways of doing it.

14:56.960 --> 14:57.929
Very true.

14:59.696 --> 15:01.563
Listen, I'm not here to
diminish anyone's work.

15:01.565 --> 15:03.298
I'm just here looking
out for the interest

15:03.300 --> 15:04.966
of the foundation.

15:04.968 --> 15:07.739
So I promise to make this
as painless as possible.

15:08.705 --> 15:10.372
We have a big day tomorrow.

15:10.374 --> 15:12.277
Let's all try and
get some sleep, huh.

15:15.211 --> 15:17.545
You still have
to fix the infrared camera.

15:17.547 --> 15:18.780
Don't get your
panties in a twist.

15:18.782 --> 15:20.384
I'll take care of it.

15:22.552 --> 15:24.652
What do you know
about my panties?

15:30.159 --> 15:31.992
Let's try this again.

15:31.994 --> 15:33.297
I don't mean to be a dick.

15:34.465 --> 15:35.396
Too late.

15:35.398 --> 15:36.997
It's my job to be a skeptic.

15:36.999 --> 15:37.801
I'm sorry.

15:39.936 --> 15:41.770
Now, you're apologizing to me?

15:41.772 --> 15:43.271
Yeah, I read your file.

15:43.273 --> 15:45.209
I have a feeling you're
someone I want on my side.

15:46.276 --> 15:47.512
That's a little creepy.

15:48.912 --> 15:51.780
I realized that as I
was saying it.

15:51.782 --> 15:52.948
Yeah.

15:52.950 --> 15:54.181
Uh huh.

15:54.183 --> 15:56.550
Speaking of creepy,
this is a shithole, huh?

15:56.552 --> 15:58.953
Do you think it's haunted?

15:58.955 --> 16:00.590
I believe in what I could see.

16:01.758 --> 16:03.257
You do realize that
all that we can see

16:03.259 --> 16:05.962
is infinitely less than
all that we cannot, right?

16:06.930 --> 16:08.329
You're a philosopher, huh?

16:08.331 --> 16:10.033
No, I just choose
to have faith.

16:11.167 --> 16:12.767
It's like Pascal's Wager.

16:12.769 --> 16:15.603
If you believe in God and he
does exist, you go to heaven.

16:15.605 --> 16:18.540
If you don't believe and he
does exist, you go to hell.

16:18.542 --> 16:19.744
So why not believe?

16:23.113 --> 16:23.948
Who's there?

16:26.850 --> 16:27.681
Oh, hey.

16:28.918 --> 16:30.151
You know, for
a guy who doesn't

16:30.153 --> 16:31.755
believe in ghosts
you're a real pussy.

16:33.791 --> 16:35.626
I thought you said you
weren't a rat person.

16:46.103 --> 16:48.069
You know what, bro? I wanna
show you how to feed 'em

16:48.071 --> 16:49.937
in the event that
I'm preoccupied.

16:51.140 --> 16:55.876
Okay, so, only a tiny
bit right in there

16:55.878 --> 16:57.445
and only at night.

16:57.447 --> 16:58.813
They're nocturnal.

16:58.815 --> 17:01.282
Hey, do you understand?

17:01.284 --> 17:02.117
I got ya.

17:02.119 --> 17:03.851
Okay, cool.

17:03.853 --> 17:07.556
So you dosed them with
this serum and they're fine?

17:07.558 --> 17:08.955
Yeah, man, yeah.

17:08.958 --> 17:10.424
They're fine.

17:10.425 --> 17:11.358
For now.

17:11.359 --> 17:12.560
So as long as they don't have

17:12.561 --> 17:13.962
any side effects then
we should be good?

17:13.964 --> 17:15.597
Yeah, that's the plan.

17:15.598 --> 17:17.132
- Ah, shit!
- What?

17:17.134 --> 17:19.165
You smiley ratted Kravitz.

17:19.167 --> 17:20.166
Who?

17:20.169 --> 17:21.234
The black rat, he's gone.

17:21.237 --> 17:22.736
Oh, outside, outside.

17:22.738 --> 17:23.807
- Outside, outside!
- Shit!

17:26.175 --> 17:28.079
Oh, okay, come out here.

17:29.745 --> 17:31.046
Fuck, got you.

17:31.048 --> 17:33.748
What are you doing Nicodemus?

17:33.750 --> 17:36.384
Don't you wanna be here when
Dr. Mason makes history?

17:36.386 --> 17:38.118
History?

17:38.120 --> 17:39.654
Jesus, I'm surprised his bosses

17:39.656 --> 17:41.455
are even letting him do this.

17:41.457 --> 17:42.656
Huh, oh, no.

17:42.658 --> 17:44.492
Dr Weissman trusts him, man.

17:44.494 --> 17:46.228
She knows his methods
are unorthodox,

17:46.230 --> 17:48.930
but he's made her a
shitload of money.

17:48.932 --> 17:50.165
Oh!

17:50.167 --> 17:52.267
Oh, don't, don't,
don't touch that!

17:53.203 --> 17:54.402
Don't, dude.

17:55.872 --> 17:57.705
Fuck!

17:57.707 --> 17:59.540
You probably have hepatitis
from touching that.

17:59.542 --> 18:02.010
- Wouldn't be the first time.
- That's so gross.

18:02.012 --> 18:04.378
Mom shoulda fuckin' aborted you.

18:23.934 --> 18:25.799
Morning, everyone.

18:25.801 --> 18:27.034
Morning.

18:27.036 --> 18:28.636
We'll start with
half a milligram

18:28.638 --> 18:31.705
per BSA to assess side effects.

18:31.707 --> 18:34.077
Would you like to say
anything before we start?

18:35.712 --> 18:38.078
The world you're about to
experience on the other side.

18:38.080 --> 18:40.181
The other side, huh?

18:40.183 --> 18:41.750
Can look very
much like our own,

18:41.752 --> 18:44.819
but make no mistake, it is not.

18:44.821 --> 18:45.822
Spirits?

18:47.724 --> 18:49.223
Uh, yeah.

18:49.225 --> 18:51.760
Fucking awesome, but we're
gonna need way more data.

18:51.762 --> 18:54.495
Absence of evidence is
not evidence of absence.

18:54.497 --> 18:55.896
So I read here that you think

18:55.898 --> 18:58.232
that this serum will
reactivate the pineal gland.

18:58.234 --> 18:59.733
How so exactly?

18:59.735 --> 19:01.703
The pineal gland is only
active when we're children.

19:01.705 --> 19:04.705
At the onset of puberty
it begins to calcify.

19:04.707 --> 19:06.707
However, in Dr. Mason's
studies on patients

19:06.709 --> 19:09.077
with near-death
experiences we notice

19:09.079 --> 19:12.580
that the gland started secreting
various hormones again.

19:12.582 --> 19:14.982
Which is weird.

19:14.984 --> 19:16.384
You see the dark spots?

19:16.386 --> 19:18.386
That's what we are
trying to replicate here.

19:18.388 --> 19:20.021
Gland is that powerful?

19:20.023 --> 19:21.225
It's not anything new.

19:22.626 --> 19:24.358
Buddhists believe the
soul enters a human fetus

19:24.360 --> 19:26.493
49 days after human conception,

19:26.495 --> 19:29.530
which is exactly when the
pineal gland starts to form.

19:29.532 --> 19:31.098
Even Descartes believed
it to be the part

19:31.100 --> 19:33.233
of the body most
associated with the soul.

19:33.235 --> 19:35.669
Anything weird, find a
partner, use your walkies,

19:35.671 --> 19:37.774
give it 30 minutes to kick in.

19:38.942 --> 19:41.276
Trial Log Day One.

19:41.278 --> 19:43.144
Team in good spirits.

19:43.146 --> 19:47.514
Violette Paich,
administering, participating.

19:47.516 --> 19:51.286
Dr. Travis Sherman,
Shane Sherman,

19:51.288 --> 19:53.922
Maya Sanchez, myself,
participating.

19:53.924 --> 19:58.526
This may be the last
medical study I conduct.

19:58.528 --> 20:02.530
Everybody wants to find out
if the afterlife exists.

20:02.532 --> 20:04.799
I already know.

20:04.801 --> 20:06.533
Some tension in the house.

20:06.535 --> 20:09.306
Casey Blackburn already
causing problems.

21:29.619 --> 21:30.751
Just
concentrate for once.

21:30.753 --> 21:32.023
How are you guys doing?

21:33.456 --> 21:35.525
So far it matches the
baseline we set on campus.

21:39.628 --> 21:40.464
Blue star.

21:43.500 --> 21:45.269
It's a nude descending
a staircase.

21:46.535 --> 21:47.604
It's a gold fish.

21:48.772 --> 21:50.508
Have any experienced purging?

21:53.510 --> 21:54.712
I just feel alert.

21:56.012 --> 21:57.678
And focused.

21:57.680 --> 21:59.646
That would be your
side effect, Trav.

21:59.648 --> 22:01.217
What exactly is the next step?

22:02.485 --> 22:05.319
Um, EEGs and reviewing
of camera footage.

22:05.321 --> 22:06.588
Exactly.

22:06.590 --> 22:08.790
Come and find me
immediately after.

22:08.792 --> 22:11.492
I wanna be there, too,
for proper documentation.

22:11.494 --> 22:12.295
Sure.

22:46.061 --> 22:49.062
Sorry, my minions,
it's not dinner time yet.

22:51.600 --> 22:53.369
We'll see about that.

22:58.375 --> 23:00.707
Dr. Mason chose this site
due to the elevated levels

23:00.709 --> 23:02.743
of electromagnetic radiation.

23:02.745 --> 23:04.979
And all we're doing
is mapping it out.

23:04.981 --> 23:07.749
Flags go where the energy
drops back down to normal.

23:07.751 --> 23:09.017
Right here.

23:09.019 --> 23:10.284
What purpose does this
serve the experiment?

23:10.286 --> 23:12.153
In the lab, high
levels increase the

23:12.155 --> 23:13.855
effectiveness of the
serum in the rats.

23:13.857 --> 23:16.491
What do you think causes
the energy at this location?

23:16.493 --> 23:18.492
It could be
the geology of the hills

23:18.494 --> 23:20.363
or it could be something
else. It's unclear.

27:07.256 --> 27:10.524
Oh, shit.

27:16.698 --> 27:19.032
Doc, I mean, I've taken a
shit ton of drugs, right,

27:19.034 --> 27:21.903
so, I mean, I'd know a
hallucination if I saw one.

27:21.905 --> 27:24.105
I'm just trying to say that
this was something different.

27:24.107 --> 27:25.373
It was like.

27:25.375 --> 27:26.307
It was like real.

27:26.309 --> 27:27.040
- It's not...
- Hold still.

27:27.042 --> 27:27.875
Sorry.

27:27.877 --> 27:29.810
Yeah, about the same.

27:29.812 --> 27:30.914
Slightly dilated.

27:33.148 --> 27:34.784
Is this something
you expected?

27:36.019 --> 27:36.951
Yes.

27:36.953 --> 27:39.020
It was caused by the serum.

27:39.022 --> 27:41.024
Our minds are just
starting to open.

27:42.058 --> 27:43.290
It's only the beginning.

27:43.292 --> 27:45.492
Yeah, but that does
not explain what I saw.

27:45.494 --> 27:46.661
Sure, buddy.

27:46.663 --> 27:47.595
Any idea what
could've triggered it?

27:47.597 --> 27:49.196
Something from your past, maybe?

27:49.198 --> 27:51.467
Yeah, when you
do too much blow.

27:54.204 --> 27:55.502
Goddammit!

27:55.504 --> 27:56.703
I'll be right back.

27:56.705 --> 27:58.940
Pulling too much power
from that breaker.

27:58.942 --> 28:00.674
Headache's a pretty
normal side effect?

28:00.676 --> 28:01.842
Yeah.

28:01.844 --> 28:02.845
Not feeling great.

28:39.314 --> 28:43.283
So, Blackburn,
what's your story?

28:43.285 --> 28:44.918
You don't wanna hear that.

28:44.920 --> 28:46.189
Oh, yes we do.

28:47.557 --> 28:49.022
Unless it makes you
uncomfortable, of course.

28:49.024 --> 28:51.058
Especially if it makes
you uncomfortable actually.

28:51.060 --> 28:54.995
Well, I come from a long
line of New York cops.

28:54.997 --> 28:56.731
I was interested in the FBI.

28:56.733 --> 28:58.465
Well, that explains the suit.

29:01.905 --> 29:03.303
Well, obviously that
didn't pan out very well

29:03.305 --> 29:06.406
so Dr. Weissman
hired me at Milford.

29:06.408 --> 29:08.675
And you got assigned
to us. You lucky bastard.

29:29.866 --> 29:30.701
Lisa?

29:33.168 --> 29:34.338
It's coming!

29:35.471 --> 29:36.306
Lisa.

29:41.176 --> 29:44.611
Maya.

29:51.588 --> 29:52.653
Maya, are you okay?

29:59.329 --> 30:00.430
Are you okay?

30:04.701 --> 30:07.201
Maybe you should
skip the next round.

30:07.203 --> 30:08.202
I'm fine.

30:08.204 --> 30:09.502
I'll be fine.

30:09.504 --> 30:11.838
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

30:11.840 --> 30:16.847
Yeah.

30:24.419 --> 30:27.823
Maya, I really appreciate
what you're doing for us.

30:29.024 --> 30:30.857
They're always with us.

30:30.859 --> 30:32.193
Who?

30:32.195 --> 30:33.530
People we've lost.

30:34.630 --> 30:38.936
It's like, they never
wanna let us go.

30:40.770 --> 30:42.606
Maybe we can't let go.

30:47.142 --> 30:50.211
My grandmother used to
say that life is a dream

30:50.213 --> 30:53.013
and our bodies are just
vessels for our souls.

30:53.015 --> 30:55.249
And on that final day
when you close your eyes

30:55.251 --> 30:57.955
for the last time,
your soul is released.

30:59.187 --> 31:02.822
So she taught
you how to make the tea?

31:02.824 --> 31:03.960
What happened?

31:05.093 --> 31:06.763
She died after Isabel.

31:07.863 --> 31:09.696
I understand.

31:09.698 --> 31:11.464
It's impossible to overcome.

31:11.466 --> 31:15.772
Death is just
finally waking up.

31:17.040 --> 31:20.107
I saw my sister just
a few moments ago.

31:20.109 --> 31:22.678
And I had hoped that if
I came here to help you

31:24.112 --> 31:26.782
that maybe I could finally
let her go, but I can't.

31:29.385 --> 31:30.220
I know.

31:48.638 --> 31:49.805
Benny.

31:56.178 --> 31:58.148
Where are you?

32:02.685 --> 32:03.986
Can you hear me?

32:48.630 --> 32:49.632
Dr. Mason?

32:51.634 --> 32:52.602
Dr. Mason?

32:54.203 --> 32:55.034
There you are.

32:55.036 --> 32:56.273
Can I help you?

32:57.473 --> 32:58.739
When would you like to
report today's findings

32:58.741 --> 33:01.044
so I can communicate 'em
back to Dr. Weissman?

33:01.944 --> 33:03.877
I think we should wait.

33:03.879 --> 33:06.312
We need more solid data.

33:06.314 --> 33:08.250
I don't wanna waste
her time, you know?

33:11.587 --> 33:12.552
Tomorrow then.

33:12.554 --> 33:13.453
Okay.

33:13.455 --> 33:14.291
Alright.

35:20.016 --> 35:20.851
Benny?

36:21.344 --> 36:22.175
Uh oh.

36:22.177 --> 36:23.679
Don't tell Mommy, okay?

36:24.714 --> 36:26.416
I won't, I promise.

36:29.518 --> 36:30.520
Who are you?

36:31.886 --> 36:33.454
I'm Ava.

36:33.456 --> 36:35.121
My name is Andre.

36:35.123 --> 36:37.627
What are you doing here
all by yourself, Ava?

36:38.793 --> 36:41.295
I just wanted to
play with somebody.

36:41.297 --> 36:42.831
Will you stay and play with me?

36:57.013 --> 36:57.844
Ava?

36:57.846 --> 36:59.079
Yeah?

36:59.081 --> 37:02.516
Have you seen a
boy around here?

37:02.518 --> 37:04.083
No.

37:04.085 --> 37:04.919
No?

37:07.389 --> 37:11.291
He would be your
age, with brown hair.

37:11.293 --> 37:12.295
I said no.

37:13.696 --> 37:15.695
He wouldn't come here.

37:15.697 --> 37:17.130
I'm sure he's scared.

37:17.132 --> 37:17.967
He's scared of what?

37:19.000 --> 37:20.266
The Smiling Man.

37:20.268 --> 37:21.768
Who?

37:21.770 --> 37:23.804
He used to come
out when he's hungry.

37:23.806 --> 37:27.474
He's been in the house,
watching all of you.

37:27.476 --> 37:29.679
He's never seen ones
like you before.

37:31.246 --> 37:33.480
I don't like him,
the Smiling Man.

37:33.482 --> 37:34.681
What will he do?

37:34.683 --> 37:38.087
The same thing he
did to that little boy.

37:39.388 --> 37:40.320
No, wait!

37:41.489 --> 37:42.324
Ava!

37:43.525 --> 37:52.699
Wait!

38:17.159 --> 38:19.592
Trial Log Day Two.

38:19.594 --> 38:21.930
Participant tolerance
of serum excellent.

38:29.772 --> 38:32.473
First I will mention
the Smiling Man.

38:32.475 --> 38:34.875
Possible correlation to
Shane Sherman's encounter

38:34.877 --> 38:36.311
in the basement.

38:39.181 --> 38:41.217
Whether it's hallucinations.

38:44.587 --> 38:47.389
Increasing to 1.5
milligram per BSA.

38:52.627 --> 38:53.962
What the fuck?

39:24.226 --> 39:29.061
Daddy?

39:29.063 --> 39:29.898
Ben.

39:34.770 --> 39:35.869
Hey, Dad.

39:35.871 --> 39:37.206
Can you hear me?

39:45.915 --> 39:46.750
Benny!

40:10.706 --> 40:13.810
You shouldn't
be here, Maya.

40:16.311 --> 40:17.480
It's not safe.

40:19.647 --> 40:20.482
Lisa.

40:25.587 --> 40:27.122
He's hiding somewhere.

40:30.525 --> 40:31.360
Lisa.

40:40.034 --> 40:40.869
Lisa?

40:50.913 --> 40:52.579
This looks promising.

40:52.581 --> 40:54.350
It's working exactly
as we expected.

40:55.484 --> 40:56.849
Yeah, but the side effects are

40:56.851 --> 40:58.321
getting really uncomfortable.

41:00.389 --> 41:02.489
Anyone wanna quit?

41:02.491 --> 41:03.293
Good.

41:04.393 --> 41:06.061
Alright, that's my team.

41:07.295 --> 41:08.096
Guys.

41:09.331 --> 41:11.398
The serum doesn't
work like the tea.

41:11.400 --> 41:13.567
We're not simply visiting
this other plane.

41:13.569 --> 41:15.902
We are coexisting on it.

41:15.904 --> 41:17.237
What?

41:17.239 --> 41:18.438
I specifically asked
for that yesterday

41:18.440 --> 41:20.143
and he hasn't given
me anything yet.

41:23.045 --> 41:24.610
I was just going
through the inventory

41:24.612 --> 41:25.878
and I noticed there
were a few bottles

41:25.880 --> 41:28.081
of serum missing from Box Six.

41:28.083 --> 41:30.217
I'll give him his space,
but I can't do my job

41:30.219 --> 41:32.021
if he's not willing
to work with me.

42:41.522 --> 42:44.358
Maybe the serum is
inducing some kind

42:44.360 --> 42:46.259
of shared psychosis, right?

42:46.261 --> 42:49.996
I'm telling you, doc, it
looked exactly like you!

42:49.998 --> 42:51.197
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

42:51.199 --> 42:52.965
Well, subconsciously,
yes it could have...

42:52.967 --> 42:54.601
How is that fucking possible?

42:54.603 --> 42:56.172
Could be a shapeshifter.

42:57.605 --> 42:59.942
Yeah, many possibilities.

43:00.942 --> 43:02.476
What are you thinking?

43:02.478 --> 43:03.976
Let's run a scan on her,
compare it with Shane's,

43:03.978 --> 43:05.478
and then we'll
take it from there.

43:05.480 --> 43:06.281
Done.

43:07.715 --> 43:08.982
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

43:08.984 --> 43:11.050
Guys, guys, did
anybody see this?

43:11.052 --> 43:12.451
Come here, come here, come
here, come here, come here.

43:12.453 --> 43:14.420
This is what I saw in my room.

43:14.422 --> 43:15.822
What's, um, here?

43:15.824 --> 43:17.491
560 MT per millisecond,
what is happening?

43:17.493 --> 43:18.925
Whoa, whoa, whoa, the
energy field's going nuts.

43:18.927 --> 43:20.559
Get an emit, let's go.

43:20.561 --> 43:21.927
Let's go!

43:21.929 --> 43:22.764
Okay.

43:32.007 --> 43:33.710
Guys, it's up
this way, come on!

44:05.139 --> 44:06.808
Did you hear that?

44:07.743 --> 44:09.612
Someone in here, hello?

44:11.346 --> 44:13.248
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

44:15.284 --> 44:17.183
What the fuck?

44:17.185 --> 44:19.054
Jesus Christ!

44:42.177 --> 44:43.012
Oh god!

44:46.647 --> 44:47.713
You alright?

44:47.715 --> 44:48.547
It's okay.

44:48.549 --> 44:49.715
What I miss?

44:49.717 --> 44:51.150
I don't
know, I locked the door.

44:51.152 --> 44:52.418
I swear to god I
locked the door.

44:52.420 --> 44:53.987
It's
alright, it's alright.

44:53.989 --> 44:54.824
Alright?

44:56.157 --> 44:57.224
What happened?

44:57.226 --> 44:58.692
I don't know, man.

44:58.694 --> 45:00.126
Alright, I want
everybody in the living room.

45:00.128 --> 45:01.328
Come on, I wanna see
the cameras, everybody.

45:01.330 --> 45:03.130
Nothin' over here, guys.

45:03.132 --> 45:04.063
I wanna
see the cameras.

45:04.065 --> 45:05.398
You guys, come on.

45:05.400 --> 45:06.766
Everyone!

45:06.768 --> 45:08.034
- It gone in here.
- This is not a discussion.

45:08.036 --> 45:10.003
I want everyone in the
living room, let's go.

45:10.005 --> 45:10.837
Come on!

45:10.839 --> 45:11.971
Where's Andre?

45:11.973 --> 45:13.005
Mason!

45:13.007 --> 45:14.773
Andre!

45:30.525 --> 45:32.592
Stop, stop, wait,
um, right there.

45:32.594 --> 45:33.429
Go back.

45:37.965 --> 45:40.233
What the hell is that?

45:40.235 --> 45:42.138
What is it, a spirit?

45:43.538 --> 45:44.973
We can't ignore this.

45:48.177 --> 45:49.576
This experiment is
on hold until we

45:49.578 --> 45:50.809
find out who killed those rats.

45:50.811 --> 45:52.878
Hold on, what are
you talking about?

45:52.880 --> 45:54.346
Without those rats,
we have no gauge

45:54.348 --> 45:55.748
of the serum's danger.

45:55.750 --> 45:56.650
Yes, we do.

45:56.652 --> 45:57.583
Did you do this?

45:57.585 --> 45:58.518
What?

45:58.520 --> 45:59.786
To try to stop the experiment.

45:59.788 --> 46:01.554
Don't you ever question me.

46:01.556 --> 46:03.355
I'm calling Dr. Weissman.

46:03.357 --> 46:04.925
Oh, good, good, yeah.

46:04.927 --> 46:06.259
Do you run to her
for everything?

46:06.261 --> 46:07.527
I do when half
the participants

46:07.529 --> 46:09.762
in our trial just
up and disappear.

46:09.764 --> 46:11.297
Casey, please.

46:11.299 --> 46:13.333
You are going to compromise
all that we have worked for.

46:13.335 --> 46:15.235
Just wait and let us try
to find out what happened.

46:15.237 --> 46:16.739
- Please.
- I'm sorry, I can't.

46:17.906 --> 46:18.741
Fuck!

46:20.708 --> 46:21.541
Hang up the phone.

46:21.543 --> 46:23.476
I'm making the call.

46:23.478 --> 46:26.645
Give us 24 hours to
evaluate the situation and

46:26.647 --> 46:29.683
make a judgment call about the
viability of this experiment.

46:29.685 --> 46:31.684
Who the hell do
you think you are?

46:31.686 --> 46:33.386
I'm the man whom
Weissman has funded

46:33.388 --> 46:35.422
and trusted for over 10 years.

46:35.424 --> 46:39.259
And you are just a
plausible deniability,

46:39.261 --> 46:42.161
some peon they
sent so they could

46:42.163 --> 46:44.364
say they covered their asses.

46:45.601 --> 46:48.571
Now, who do you think
they're gonna listen to?

46:51.373 --> 46:53.473
Alright, I'll
give you 24 hours.

46:53.475 --> 46:56.946
I'll make it as painless
as possible, I promise.

47:05.286 --> 47:06.788
How you feeling?

47:10.525 --> 47:12.726
Listen, I need to talk to you.

47:12.728 --> 47:14.463
I heard everything
you needed to say.

47:15.596 --> 47:16.596
No, it's not that.

47:16.598 --> 47:18.931
Do you think that, uh.

47:18.933 --> 47:21.201
Do you think that Dr.
Mason's been acting strange?

47:21.203 --> 47:22.668
What?

47:22.670 --> 47:25.971
I think that he's taking more
serum than the rest of you.

47:25.973 --> 47:28.275
You are incredible.

47:28.277 --> 47:30.076
I found empty
bottles in his room.

47:30.078 --> 47:31.744
He is the doctor.

47:31.746 --> 47:33.679
It makes sense for him to
have serum in his room.

47:33.681 --> 47:35.116
What the fuck are you saying?

47:36.518 --> 47:38.684
Listen, I'm just trying
to do my job, alright?

47:38.686 --> 47:40.353
Yeah, well, stop.

47:46.060 --> 47:48.396
Hey, guys, come in here.

47:51.199 --> 47:52.599
What's wrong?

47:52.601 --> 47:54.333
There's someone
in here with us.

47:54.335 --> 47:55.534
What?

47:55.536 --> 47:57.003
- This is ridiculous.
- Well, Casey...

47:57.005 --> 47:58.374
This is bullshit.

47:59.473 --> 48:00.940
Uh, it's.

48:00.942 --> 48:02.641
You got her in on this, too?

48:02.643 --> 48:04.076
How did you get here?

48:04.078 --> 48:07.148
It's been a long time since
I've walked with anyone.

48:09.250 --> 48:12.451
Especially anyone alive.

48:12.453 --> 48:13.753
It's okay.

48:13.755 --> 48:14.887
Don't worry about it.

48:14.889 --> 48:17.223
He's not gonna hurt you.

48:17.225 --> 48:18.728
How do you know?

48:20.161 --> 48:20.996
Because.

48:26.868 --> 48:28.536
What is she doing?

48:29.837 --> 48:32.774
Don't touch me!

48:35.476 --> 48:37.143
Maya.

48:41.750 --> 48:44.717
What the hell is that?

48:44.719 --> 48:46.152
Stay away from me!

48:55.931 --> 48:57.262
Are you okay?

49:21.556 --> 49:22.358
Jesus Christ.

49:25.659 --> 49:29.628
Okay, trial is advancing
faster than anticipated.

49:29.630 --> 49:32.665
First physical contact
with a paranormal subject.

49:32.667 --> 49:36.339
It appears that the pineal
activity is altering our physio.

49:39.074 --> 49:39.909
Ben.

49:50.719 --> 49:52.152
Daddy?

49:52.154 --> 49:52.987
Ben!

49:56.190 --> 49:57.857
The Smiling Man.

49:57.859 --> 49:58.694
Ben!

50:00.494 --> 50:01.330
Run!

50:05.500 --> 50:06.936
He's coming, run!

50:08.869 --> 50:10.103
Benny!

50:10.772 --> 50:11.974
Daddy!

50:13.241 --> 50:14.076
Benny!

50:16.210 --> 50:17.543
Benny!

50:21.183 --> 50:22.016
Ben!

50:25.020 --> 50:25.855
Benny!

50:37.498 --> 50:39.067
Hey, Sleeping Beauty.

50:43.605 --> 50:44.974
Don't worry, I'm almost done.

50:46.540 --> 50:47.542
Whoa, what's that?

50:51.580 --> 50:53.616
Relax, it's empty.

50:57.319 --> 51:00.887
Not too shabby for your first
ghost encounter, by the way.

51:00.889 --> 51:02.355
What, the shaking?

51:02.357 --> 51:04.090
That was an earthquake.

51:04.092 --> 51:05.058
An earthquake?

51:05.060 --> 51:06.992
No, no, no, he was yelling.

51:06.994 --> 51:09.161
And Maya went right through
him, but Andre pushed him

51:09.163 --> 51:11.563
right before the
cabinet exploded.

51:11.565 --> 51:12.866
He did?

51:12.868 --> 51:13.701
Mm-hmm.

51:16.770 --> 51:21.074
Thank you for that, by the way.

51:21.076 --> 51:22.541
I'm glad you're okay.

51:22.543 --> 51:25.011
You're just
saying that 'cause I

51:25.013 --> 51:27.579
took a glass to
the face for you.

51:27.581 --> 51:29.782
Not gonna lie,
that's about 99& of it.

51:29.784 --> 51:31.287
Yeah, I knew it.

51:32.654 --> 51:33.822
Hey, Violette.

51:34.656 --> 51:35.889
Yeah.

51:35.891 --> 51:37.155
If there was really
something there tonight,

51:37.157 --> 51:39.058
Dr. Mason's been taking
the same amount of serum

51:39.060 --> 51:43.833
as Maya, why was he able
to touch it and she wasn't?

51:51.038 --> 51:52.707
It's just a thought.

52:46.962 --> 52:47.795
No.

52:49.197 --> 52:50.195
No!

52:50.197 --> 52:51.032
No, no!

52:52.299 --> 52:53.301
Rebecca, no!

52:54.302 --> 52:55.137
No!

52:56.471 --> 52:58.337
No, stay with me!

52:58.339 --> 53:00.873
No!

53:00.875 --> 53:01.940
No!

53:01.942 --> 53:03.476
Rebecca, no!

53:03.478 --> 53:04.280
No!

53:06.081 --> 53:08.884
Andre.

53:10.085 --> 53:14.990
What are you doing?

53:18.860 --> 53:19.862
Oh my god.

53:22.697 --> 53:24.199
I knew you'd come.

53:26.333 --> 53:28.300
I knew you would come.

53:28.302 --> 53:33.308
I'm so sorry.

53:34.109 --> 53:35.177
I'm so sorry.

53:48.389 --> 53:51.225
What the hell
is wrong with you?

53:53.261 --> 53:54.263
I'm sorry.

53:55.196 --> 53:57.864
I thought you were my wife, I.

53:57.866 --> 53:58.701
Look at me.

54:01.402 --> 54:02.870
How much have you taken?

54:06.507 --> 54:08.907
It's changing you,
you have to stop.

54:08.909 --> 54:11.143
You're opening up a door
that you can't close.

54:11.145 --> 54:13.012
I already told
you, I warned you.

54:13.014 --> 54:15.715
Question me again,
you're off the team.

54:15.717 --> 54:17.083
No, this isn't about you.

54:17.085 --> 54:18.918
You're putting all
of us in danger.

54:18.920 --> 54:19.755
Get out.

54:32.900 --> 54:35.233
Trav, shit is
getting way fucking weird.

54:35.235 --> 54:36.668
Mm-hmm.

54:36.670 --> 54:39.838
Bro, hey, don't you
think we should be thinking

54:39.840 --> 54:41.543
about getting the
fuck outta here?

54:43.277 --> 54:45.346
No, what, what are
you talking about?

54:46.947 --> 54:49.415
Now that we're actually making
history you want me to quit?

54:49.417 --> 54:50.616
You're the one who like my whole

54:50.618 --> 54:52.384
life has been like
don't give up.

54:52.386 --> 54:53.753
History?

54:53.755 --> 54:55.621
Dude, we came her to study shit.

54:55.623 --> 54:57.422
- Not be attacked by it.
- Right.

54:57.424 --> 54:58.760
We're not going anywhere.

54:59.728 --> 55:00.696
It's not happening.

55:02.163 --> 55:03.195
Well, if this
works we're gonna

55:03.197 --> 55:04.799
have one hell of a story, right?

55:06.201 --> 55:08.067
I mean, shit, we could
write a book or something.

55:08.069 --> 55:09.634
I mean, you could write a book.

55:09.636 --> 55:10.972
I'm not gonna write a book.

55:13.507 --> 55:14.907
Whoa.

55:14.909 --> 55:16.108
Yeah, Camera Two's freaking
out in the greenhouse.

55:16.110 --> 55:17.576
You know what, I'm
gonna check that out.

55:17.578 --> 55:19.378
Hey, hey, hey, hey, I don't
want you goin' out there

55:19.380 --> 55:21.480
with everything that's happened.

55:21.482 --> 55:23.181
If you're not
gonna do your job

55:23.183 --> 55:26.719
or if you don't want to,
that's okay, I'll do it.

55:26.721 --> 55:28.221
Come on.

55:28.223 --> 55:29.288
I just don't wanna miss
anything is what it is.

55:29.290 --> 55:30.489
Okay.

55:30.491 --> 55:31.623
I lost something
really important to me

55:31.625 --> 55:33.291
- and I'm not gonna...
- Bro, bro.

55:33.293 --> 55:34.826
Alright, listen.

55:34.828 --> 55:37.265
Go to bed, I will
take care of it

55:38.333 --> 55:39.232
first thing in the morning.

55:39.234 --> 55:40.703
I swear to God.

55:41.703 --> 55:42.969
Scout's honor.

55:42.971 --> 55:43.902
Let's get some rest, man.

55:43.904 --> 55:45.270
We're both fucking tired, yeah?

55:45.272 --> 55:46.706
Mm-hmm.

55:46.708 --> 55:51.344
Do you remember
when Mom was backing

55:51.346 --> 55:53.849
out of the driveway and
she ran over Samson?

55:55.016 --> 55:58.416
And I locked myself
in my room and you

55:58.418 --> 56:03.424
broke in and you had
painted a dog on your face

56:04.592 --> 56:07.360
and you had those
tube socks for ears?

56:07.362 --> 56:08.628
Yeah.

56:08.630 --> 56:11.730
And I like brushed
you out of my room?

56:11.732 --> 56:14.199
The truth is is that meant a lot

56:14.201 --> 56:16.671
to me, man, and it helped.

56:18.706 --> 56:19.938
What are big
brothers for, man?

56:19.940 --> 56:20.875
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

56:22.643 --> 56:23.476
Imma go to bed.

56:23.478 --> 56:24.613
Yeah, go to bed, man.

56:25.913 --> 56:26.878
Hey, don't forget though.

56:26.880 --> 56:28.146
I won't forget, first thing.

56:28.148 --> 56:29.081
I love, bro.

56:29.083 --> 56:30.185
I love you, too.

57:28.375 --> 57:33.179
Daddy?

57:33.181 --> 57:35.016
I can help you, Daddy.

57:50.431 --> 57:51.867
It's okay, Daddy.

57:54.534 --> 57:56.038
It'll all be okay.

58:06.080 --> 58:11.085
Another.

58:11.819 --> 58:12.654
I can't, Benny.

58:16.590 --> 58:17.993
I know you can.

58:24.998 --> 58:26.234
I know you can.

58:42.382 --> 58:43.886
Daddy, protect me.

58:44.752 --> 58:48.753
I'll make it better, okay?

58:48.755 --> 58:50.625
It'll all be okay, Daddy.

58:52.326 --> 58:53.326
Come with me.

58:53.328 --> 58:54.496
Let go, Daddy.

58:55.897 --> 58:57.398
I love you, Daddy.

59:32.333 --> 59:33.898
Trav?

59:33.900 --> 59:35.069
What the fuck?

59:36.337 --> 59:37.172
Oh, shit.

01:00:08.136 --> 01:00:09.367
Can't sleep either, huh?

01:00:09.369 --> 01:00:11.339
I got a lot on my
mind after today.

01:00:13.641 --> 01:00:15.041
What are you up to?

01:00:15.043 --> 01:00:17.809
Can't stop thinking
about that thing

01:00:17.811 --> 01:00:20.014
that I saw in my room earlier.

01:00:21.114 --> 01:00:22.717
Have you ever heard of a nokken?

01:00:24.819 --> 01:00:26.184
No, what is it?

01:00:26.186 --> 01:00:29.223
It's a Norwegian
bogeyman, a shapeshifter.

01:00:37.998 --> 01:00:40.465
It seems like most cultures
have these insanely

01:00:40.467 --> 01:00:43.701
similar legends of creatures
that can change form.

01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:51.043
Run around, cause trouble,
steal gold, take kids.

01:00:51.045 --> 01:00:52.344
That sounds like a really bad

01:00:52.346 --> 01:00:53.748
thing to research
right before bed.

01:00:57.085 --> 01:00:58.918
I just find it fascinating
how completely isolated

01:00:58.920 --> 01:01:02.188
cultures can come up with
the same imaginary monsters.

01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:04.926
Maybe because
it's not imaginary.

01:01:06.159 --> 01:01:08.330
It's all usually based
on some sort of fact.

01:01:09.596 --> 01:01:11.063
My grandmother used
to tell me stories

01:01:11.065 --> 01:01:13.467
about El Disencarnado,

01:01:16.603 --> 01:01:18.540
a being without flesh.

01:01:22.210 --> 01:01:24.009
I don't know that
one, is it a spirit?

01:01:24.011 --> 01:01:28.713
Maybe it was once,
but not any more.

01:01:28.715 --> 01:01:31.018
The dead aren't the only
ones beyond the grave.

01:01:37.924 --> 01:01:38.627
So what is it?

01:01:40.094 --> 01:01:43.665
A being deemed unworthy to
leave the Earth after death.

01:01:44.764 --> 01:01:46.567
It longs to be alive.

01:01:48.536 --> 01:01:49.671
It hunts,

01:01:51.038 --> 01:01:53.942
hoping that if it eats
enough flesh of the innocent

01:01:55.109 --> 01:01:57.710
it's own flesh will
be returned to it.

01:01:59.045 --> 01:02:01.015
So do you think
it's out there?

01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:06.922
Good luck going to sleep now.

01:02:09.489 --> 01:02:10.792
Goddammit, Trav!

01:02:13.661 --> 01:02:15.530
I told you not to come out here.

01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:33.712
Trav!

01:02:33.714 --> 01:02:34.683
Come on, man.

01:02:35.616 --> 01:02:36.451
Fuck.

01:02:43.891 --> 01:02:44.726
Trav!

01:02:49.797 --> 01:02:50.632
Shit.

01:02:54.368 --> 01:02:56.237
Trav, are you there?

01:03:14.589 --> 01:03:15.422
Trav.

01:03:19.159 --> 01:03:19.994
Fuck.

01:03:31.605 --> 01:03:32.439
Oh.

01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:35.507
Oh my god.

01:03:35.509 --> 01:03:38.143
Oh, oh shit!

01:03:38.145 --> 01:03:40.215
Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:03:54.462 --> 01:03:55.630
Fuck, come on!

01:03:59.366 --> 01:04:00.201
Oh my god.

01:04:02.168 --> 01:04:03.003
Fuck.

01:04:11.612 --> 01:04:12.478
Oh my god.

01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:13.380
Please God.

01:04:14.315 --> 01:04:15.313
Oh!

01:04:15.315 --> 01:04:16.150
Oh, shit!

01:04:36.503 --> 01:04:37.703
No, no!

01:04:37.705 --> 01:04:38.973
Please God, no!

01:04:40.174 --> 01:04:41.639
Oh, shit!

01:04:41.641 --> 01:04:42.476
No!

01:05:19.647 --> 01:05:20.482
Shane!

01:05:21.549 --> 01:05:23.114
Shane!

01:05:23.116 --> 01:05:24.952
Shane, come on, man.

01:05:29.522 --> 01:05:30.357
Shane!

01:06:40.427 --> 01:06:42.830
What are you doing in here?

01:06:44.397 --> 01:06:46.166
You gotta see this.

01:06:48.701 --> 01:06:49.904
This was his house.

01:06:53.907 --> 01:06:55.377
What are you talking about?

01:06:56.911 --> 01:06:57.746
Oh my god.

01:07:00.147 --> 01:07:01.112
It's him.

01:07:01.114 --> 01:07:02.581
It was his son who died here!

01:07:02.583 --> 01:07:04.650
These are all missing kids.

01:07:04.652 --> 01:07:06.321
- Unbelievable.
- From everywhere.

01:07:10.424 --> 01:07:12.427
This is my sister, Isabel.

01:07:13.493 --> 01:07:15.393
These are photos.

01:07:15.395 --> 01:07:16.230
Shane!

01:07:17.730 --> 01:07:19.197
Why would he be up here?

01:07:19.199 --> 01:07:21.101
'Cause I told him
to fix the camera.

01:07:23.837 --> 01:07:26.304
Oh.

01:07:26.306 --> 01:07:27.908
Uh, uh.

01:07:29.677 --> 01:07:30.512
Shane?

01:07:34.949 --> 01:07:36.451
Oh my fucking God!

01:07:38.152 --> 01:07:39.284
No.

01:07:39.286 --> 01:07:40.485
Travis?

01:07:40.487 --> 01:07:41.820
Shane!

01:07:41.822 --> 01:07:42.654
Travis.

01:07:42.656 --> 01:07:43.889
What?

01:07:43.891 --> 01:07:44.726
Look at this.

01:07:48.795 --> 01:07:49.630
Andre!

01:07:53.534 --> 01:07:54.369
That's enough.

01:07:57.337 --> 01:07:58.402
Andre.

01:07:58.404 --> 01:08:01.172
Guys, help.

01:08:01.174 --> 01:08:02.674
What kind of
scientist are you?

01:08:02.676 --> 01:08:07.648
We found blood in the
greenhouse and drag marks.

01:08:08.749 --> 01:08:10.716
We gotta find Shane.

01:08:10.718 --> 01:08:13.118
If it has taken Shane,
we are all targets now.

01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:15.423
It's time for you to
tell the fucking truth.

01:08:16.389 --> 01:08:18.256
That's his real research.

01:08:18.258 --> 01:08:19.658
What the fuck is this?

01:08:19.660 --> 01:08:21.193
He's been obsessed
with death for years.

01:08:21.194 --> 01:08:23.161
That's what he thinks
killed his kid.

01:08:23.162 --> 01:08:27.165
This is him with his
family in this house.

01:08:27.167 --> 01:08:28.500
He didn't acquire
it for the trial.

01:08:28.502 --> 01:08:29.902
Maya, please.

01:08:29.904 --> 01:08:32.470
This is the real
reason why he came to me.

01:08:32.471 --> 01:08:34.241
Because of what
happened to Isabel.

01:08:35.276 --> 01:08:36.308
Who is Isabel?

01:08:36.310 --> 01:08:37.542
She's my sister.

01:08:37.544 --> 01:08:38.975
She was killed in the
middle of the night.

01:08:38.978 --> 01:08:40.211
Something took her.

01:08:40.212 --> 01:08:42.180
Like my son was
taken, I was there.

01:08:42.182 --> 01:08:45.751
He had been drawing
these for weeks.

01:08:45.752 --> 01:08:48.386
Something attacked him, I
couldn't see it, but he could.

01:08:48.388 --> 01:08:49.621
You've been
taking more serum

01:08:49.622 --> 01:08:50.453
than the rest of
them, haven't you?

01:08:50.456 --> 01:08:52.090
He's right.

01:08:52.091 --> 01:08:54.457
He thinks that's
gonna help him see it.

01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:55.993
Your sister was
taken the same way.

01:08:55.995 --> 01:08:58.229
It fed on them.

01:08:58.231 --> 01:08:59.198
In the woods.

01:09:02.468 --> 01:09:03.466
Wait, wait.

01:09:03.469 --> 01:09:04.304
Why?

01:09:05.203 --> 01:09:06.970
How could you do this to us?

01:09:06.973 --> 01:09:09.975
It's taken so many
children, not just here.

01:09:09.977 --> 01:09:11.810
Not just my son or Isabel.

01:09:11.812 --> 01:09:13.545
This has nothing to
do with the science,

01:09:13.546 --> 01:09:15.546
not even the experiment.

01:09:15.548 --> 01:09:17.515
He was hunting
it the whole time.

01:09:17.517 --> 01:09:18.350
Fuck!

01:09:18.352 --> 01:09:20.786
Now we can stop it.

01:09:20.787 --> 01:09:23.755
I trusted you.

01:09:23.756 --> 01:09:25.023
It's time to go.

01:09:25.024 --> 01:09:27.359
You have no fucking
idea what we've done!

01:09:27.361 --> 01:09:28.830
Travis, let's go.

01:09:31.064 --> 01:09:33.363
I'm not going
anywhere without Shane.

01:09:33.366 --> 01:09:35.131
Fuck, Travis, come on!

01:09:35.134 --> 01:09:36.603
I'll help you find him.

01:09:37.670 --> 01:09:40.973
Good.

01:09:40.975 --> 01:09:41.808
Guys, wait up.

01:09:43.877 --> 01:09:45.210
Casey, I am so sorry.

01:09:45.212 --> 01:09:46.444
We should have listened
to you to start with.

01:09:46.446 --> 01:09:47.679
We gotta get outta here.

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:49.747
What are
we gonna do about Shane?

01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:50.651
What the hell is that?

01:10:02.463 --> 01:10:03.662
Shane?

01:10:03.664 --> 01:10:05.333
Shane, what the hell
happened to you?

01:10:19.812 --> 01:10:22.014
Oh my God, that's not Shane.

01:10:38.464 --> 01:10:39.766
How the hell can it see?

01:10:46.507 --> 01:10:50.509
You were gonna shut us down
and I had to do something.

01:10:52.445 --> 01:10:54.445
What the fuck,
that empty syringe!

01:10:54.447 --> 01:10:56.280
I'm so sorry.

01:11:04.258 --> 01:11:05.226
Stay down.

01:11:53.406 --> 01:11:54.238
Fuck you!

01:12:06.553 --> 01:12:07.985
Casey!

01:12:07.987 --> 01:12:08.789
Casey!

01:12:12.558 --> 01:12:13.692
What?

01:12:13.694 --> 01:12:15.060
Hold on!

01:12:15.062 --> 01:12:16.327
- What the fuck?
- Take it easy, it's okay.

01:12:16.329 --> 01:12:17.595
- Take it easy.
- Take it easy.

01:12:17.597 --> 01:12:19.131
- It's okay.
- Casey, calm the fuck down!

01:12:19.133 --> 01:12:21.132
We heard screaming, we
came as fast as we could.

01:12:21.134 --> 01:12:23.835
- You alright?
- No, where's Violette.

01:12:23.837 --> 01:12:26.771
We don't know, I don't know.

01:12:26.773 --> 01:12:28.340
Did you ever
take an injection?

01:12:28.342 --> 01:12:29.608
Yeah, apparently one.

01:12:29.610 --> 01:12:31.643
What does it matter?

01:12:31.645 --> 01:12:35.079
What if all this time
it wasn't about the kids?

01:12:35.081 --> 01:12:37.384
They were simply the
only prey it could see.

01:12:38.518 --> 01:12:40.519
El Disencarnado.

01:12:40.521 --> 01:12:41.355
What?

01:12:42.655 --> 01:12:43.857
The Discarnate.

01:12:45.359 --> 01:12:47.458
When we started
taking injections

01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:50.127
we made ourselves visible to it.

01:12:50.129 --> 01:12:51.595
The pineal gland.

01:12:51.597 --> 01:12:54.498
Fuck you, we've
got to get help.

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:56.301
This thing, the more flesh it

01:12:56.303 --> 01:12:58.403
consumes the more
human it becomes.

01:12:58.405 --> 01:12:59.970
It's changing.

01:12:59.972 --> 01:13:03.108
Becoming human
means becoming mortal.

01:13:03.110 --> 01:13:04.408
I injured it.

01:13:04.410 --> 01:13:05.911
So there's still a chance.

01:13:05.913 --> 01:13:07.211
Yes.

01:13:07.213 --> 01:13:08.512
You better shoot
me up because I'm

01:13:08.514 --> 01:13:10.084
not walking to this
fucking thing blind.

01:13:12.386 --> 01:13:13.221
All of us.

01:13:15.888 --> 01:13:17.421
Yeah.

01:13:17.423 --> 01:13:18.924
Fuck, fuck.

01:13:18.926 --> 01:13:20.328
Okay, okay, fuck.

01:13:23.230 --> 01:13:24.563
Fuck.

01:13:24.565 --> 01:13:26.131
Okay, okay.

01:13:26.133 --> 01:13:27.332
Oh, shit.

01:13:27.334 --> 01:13:28.236
Oh, oh, no.

01:13:31.304 --> 01:13:32.436
Violette.

01:13:32.438 --> 01:13:34.104
Shane!

01:13:34.106 --> 01:13:35.707
Violette!

01:13:35.709 --> 01:13:36.611
This way!

01:13:47.454 --> 01:13:49.190
Oh shit, the trees.

01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:55.760
Casey.

01:13:55.762 --> 01:13:57.295
Okay, come on.

01:13:57.297 --> 01:13:58.762
Let's go.

01:13:58.764 --> 01:13:59.767
Oh my god.

01:14:12.411 --> 01:14:13.815
Slow movements.

01:14:19.887 --> 01:14:22.290
They're everywhere.

01:14:50.883 --> 01:14:52.587
What the fuck is this?

01:14:55.621 --> 01:14:56.554
Casey.

01:14:56.556 --> 01:14:57.421
I can't breathe.

01:14:57.423 --> 01:14:58.823
Casey, look at me.

01:14:58.825 --> 01:15:00.261
Remember where you are, okay?

01:15:01.227 --> 01:15:02.793
Hey, let's go.

01:15:02.795 --> 01:15:03.627
Let's keep it moving.

01:15:03.629 --> 01:15:05.229
Come on.

01:15:05.231 --> 01:15:06.499
I can't move.

01:15:17.343 --> 01:15:18.275
What?

01:15:18.277 --> 01:15:22.814
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:15:22.816 --> 01:15:24.685
No, no, no, no, guys help.

01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:27.918
Shane!

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:29.789
Shane, Shane, talk to me.

01:15:31.258 --> 01:15:32.090
Hey.

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:35.493
Fuck!

01:15:35.495 --> 01:15:36.795
Where the fuck is Andre?

01:15:36.797 --> 01:15:37.632
Dr. Mason!

01:15:39.499 --> 01:15:40.799
We did this!

01:15:40.801 --> 01:15:41.666
We gotta fucking go!

01:15:41.668 --> 01:15:42.904
Go, leave!

01:16:27.481 --> 01:16:30.217
No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:17:10.389 --> 01:17:11.392
Oh my god.

01:17:21.468 --> 01:17:22.370
Violette.

01:17:32.411 --> 01:17:33.444
It's okay.

01:17:33.446 --> 01:17:35.579
It's okay, I'm here.

01:17:35.581 --> 01:17:36.713
You're safe.

01:17:36.715 --> 01:17:37.948
You're safe.

01:17:37.950 --> 01:17:42.956
It's alright, shh, shh, shh.

01:17:58.504 --> 01:17:59.339
Andre.

01:18:00.706 --> 01:18:03.041
Wake the fuck up!

01:18:03.043 --> 01:18:03.878
Oh my god.

01:18:06.312 --> 01:18:07.647
What did you do?

01:18:13.219 --> 01:18:15.420
Oh, fuck!

01:18:15.422 --> 01:18:16.257
Casey!

01:18:17.423 --> 01:18:18.258
Casey!

01:18:19.860 --> 01:18:21.259
What?

01:18:21.261 --> 01:18:22.096
Fuck!

01:18:23.262 --> 01:18:24.061
We're gonna get
you outta here.

01:18:24.063 --> 01:18:25.729
Get away from her.

01:18:25.731 --> 01:18:26.965
It's not Violette.

01:18:26.967 --> 01:18:27.899
What, what are
you talking about?

01:18:27.901 --> 01:18:29.904
It's a trick!

01:18:31.804 --> 01:18:33.337
Oh my God, no.

01:18:33.339 --> 01:18:35.907
I just found Andre's
body in his bedroom.

01:18:35.909 --> 01:18:37.341
That's not him.

01:18:37.343 --> 01:18:38.275
What?

01:18:38.277 --> 01:18:39.112
Andre is dead!

01:18:40.312 --> 01:18:41.813
Stay the fuck away from us!

01:18:41.815 --> 01:18:43.247
I don't know what
this is, but this isn't him.

01:18:43.249 --> 01:18:44.082
What are
you talking about?

01:18:44.084 --> 01:18:45.149
You don't understand.

01:18:45.151 --> 01:18:46.283
- Maya!
- No!

01:18:46.285 --> 01:18:47.719
Please, Maya, tell me...

01:18:47.721 --> 01:18:49.086
- Casey!
- Run!

01:18:49.088 --> 01:18:51.655
- Stop!
- Guys, what the fuck!

01:18:51.657 --> 01:18:54.091
That's not Violette!

01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:55.963
Fucking run!

01:19:07.606 --> 01:19:10.343
Hurry.

01:19:30.931 --> 01:19:32.296
Casey!

01:19:41.607 --> 01:19:42.506
Maya!

01:19:42.508 --> 01:19:43.343
Kill it!

01:19:44.311 --> 01:19:45.146
Kill it!

01:19:48.114 --> 01:19:49.380
Casey!

01:20:05.764 --> 01:20:06.600
Fucker!

01:20:31.725 --> 01:20:33.060
Why did you do this?

01:20:35.629 --> 01:20:37.497
You coulda just told us.

01:20:40.566 --> 01:20:42.235
I didn't know how.

01:20:45.638 --> 01:20:48.676
I just had to be with my
family here, see my son.

01:20:50.643 --> 01:20:51.611
What's it like?

01:20:52.945 --> 01:20:55.680
Your grandmother's right.

01:20:55.682 --> 01:20:56.650
It's like returning.

01:20:58.384 --> 01:20:59.186
Coming home.

01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:02.552
Well, you came back.

01:21:02.554 --> 01:21:04.421
Why did you come back?

01:21:04.423 --> 01:21:08.127
What I did I cannot make
it right, but I had to try.

01:21:12.565 --> 01:21:13.400
It's over now.

01:21:14.301 --> 01:21:16.904
Just go, live your life.

01:21:18.804 --> 01:21:19.639
It's gone.

01:21:36.056 --> 01:21:39.924
But what if it
wasn't the only one?

01:21:39.926 --> 01:21:40.761
Andre.

01:21:44.164 --> 01:21:44.999
Andre.
