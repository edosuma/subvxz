WEBVTT

00:01.529 --> 00:03.335
Previously on Madam Secretary...

00:03.336 --> 00:05.368
Someone is stalking our kids.

00:07.433 --> 00:10.158
You live surrounded by security
and yet they still can't

00:10.159 --> 00:11.551
find whoever's hacking our house

00:11.552 --> 00:14.287
- and stalking our entire family?
- Yes, I know.

00:14.288 --> 00:16.289
What's an antiquities expert

00:16.290 --> 00:17.791
at a history museum doing

00:17.792 --> 00:19.174
selling stolen treasures?

00:19.175 --> 00:21.108
We'll find an agent
who can pass for her.

00:21.109 --> 00:23.252
Set up a meeting to buy one
of these statues and boom.

00:23.253 --> 00:25.286
We have a direct line
to Hizb Al-Shahid.

00:27.014 --> 00:29.315
Cecile looks like our archaeologist.

00:31.018 --> 00:32.719
This is Black Dog Station.

00:32.720 --> 00:34.287
Who the hell just took our agent?

00:35.850 --> 00:37.391
Come on.

00:37.392 --> 00:39.593
It's been over an hour.

00:39.594 --> 00:41.995
How long does it take
to upload a damn video?

00:41.996 --> 00:44.932
They have to stick to protocols
getting back to the safe house.

00:44.933 --> 00:46.233
Screw protocols!

00:46.234 --> 00:48.268
Our asset has been abducted.

00:48.269 --> 00:49.612
She could be in a hole someplace,

00:49.613 --> 00:50.518
getting interrogated

00:50.519 --> 00:52.406
by God knows who... or worse.

00:52.407 --> 00:54.307
Wi-Fi is spotty in Corsica.

00:57.211 --> 00:58.545
Cecile said the meet went fine.

00:58.546 --> 01:00.380
She's green, but she's smart enough

01:00.381 --> 01:01.644
to know if she got made, right?

01:01.645 --> 01:04.279
Or we made a mistake sending her in.

01:06.187 --> 01:08.154
Here it is.

01:08.922 --> 01:10.290
Give us something.

01:10.291 --> 01:12.725
There she is.

01:16.430 --> 01:17.898
There!

01:17.899 --> 01:19.666
The license plate.

01:19.667 --> 01:21.135
It's pretty blurry.

01:21.136 --> 01:23.437
Is that S-A?

01:23.438 --> 01:25.639
2-T-1... R...

01:25.640 --> 01:26.974
Three?

01:26.975 --> 01:28.442
Or an eight.

01:28.443 --> 01:30.777
I'll send it to Interpol both ways.

01:30.778 --> 01:32.246
Can they not

01:32.247 --> 01:33.980
get bogged down in protocols?

01:35.215 --> 01:36.716
This is hope.

01:37.784 --> 01:40.053
Go home, buddy.

01:40.054 --> 01:41.921
I'll give you a call if we get a hit.

01:42.656 --> 01:44.758
No.

01:44.759 --> 01:46.326
I'm gonna... look at the latest reports

01:46.327 --> 01:47.660
from our asset in Algeria.

01:48.829 --> 01:51.165
Sounds like HS is
bringing in new leadership.

01:51.166 --> 01:53.666
Maybe that has something to
do with them grabbing Cecile.

01:54.801 --> 01:58.004
I'll get the takeout menus.

02:01.241 --> 02:02.242
Good morning.

02:02.243 --> 02:03.977
Do we have any cereal?

02:03.978 --> 02:06.480
Come on, I made eggs.

02:06.481 --> 02:09.316
I read Julia Child's
entire chapter on eggs

02:09.317 --> 02:12.052
and I am telling you
that these are very close

02:12.053 --> 02:14.354
to approximating

02:14.355 --> 02:15.455
something from that.

02:15.456 --> 02:17.591
Dad puts, green stuff in it.

02:17.592 --> 02:18.559
Chives.

02:18.560 --> 02:19.560
And shallots.

02:19.561 --> 02:20.961
Scramble shaming?

02:20.962 --> 02:22.896
Really? Wow.

02:22.897 --> 02:25.666
Put that in your mouth.

02:25.667 --> 02:26.700
Not bad.

02:26.701 --> 02:29.002
So, Dad's just never coming back then?

02:29.003 --> 02:32.372
Yes, I forgot to tell you
that your father's taken

02:32.373 --> 02:33.480
the cutest little apartment

02:33.481 --> 02:34.441
- in the Pentagon.
- Mom.

02:34.442 --> 02:35.568
Of course he's coming back.

02:35.569 --> 02:37.259
There's just a lot going on at work.

02:37.260 --> 02:38.745
There's a lot going on here, too.

02:38.746 --> 02:40.214
Well, I-I know, Noodle.

02:40.215 --> 02:42.849
That's why you have Andy
and Duncan protecting you.

02:42.850 --> 02:44.184
Yeah, the DS were protecting us

02:44.185 --> 02:45.546
when all the appliances went nuts.

02:45.547 --> 02:46.714
Yeah, so, Dad's supposed to quit

02:46.715 --> 02:48.255
his job 'cause you're freaked out?

02:48.256 --> 02:49.377
Don't act like it's just me.

02:49.378 --> 02:50.561
You sleep with a night-light.

02:50.562 --> 02:51.658
I left my computer on

02:51.659 --> 02:52.693
when I fell asleep.

02:52.694 --> 02:53.627
Every night?

02:53.628 --> 02:55.529
A couple times, and you know what,

02:55.530 --> 02:57.564
this guy can kill us
whether Dad's here or not.

02:57.565 --> 02:59.533
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:59.534 --> 03:01.501
Let's just take a breath, okay?

03:03.338 --> 03:06.006
Noodle, you want to take
the day and maybe stay home?

03:06.007 --> 03:07.441
No.

03:07.442 --> 03:09.676
Well... do you want to
come to work with me?

03:09.677 --> 03:11.020
Do you want her to cut your meat?

03:11.021 --> 03:12.212
- Jason.
- Forget it.

03:12.213 --> 03:14.381
I'll just power through,
and develop an ulcer

03:14.382 --> 03:16.849
and later in life, I'll send
you a bill for all my therapy.

03:18.852 --> 03:21.355
Do you want to go to therapy?

03:21.356 --> 03:23.459
Good morning, ma'am.

03:23.460 --> 03:25.626
Russell Jackson's office
needs your approval on this.

03:25.627 --> 03:27.194
Coffee?

03:27.195 --> 03:28.495
Café Au lait.

03:28.496 --> 03:30.177
The White House barista
has been practicing

03:30.178 --> 03:31.212
for the state dinner.

03:31.213 --> 03:32.599
It's coffee with milk.

03:32.600 --> 03:36.737
The French are picky
and... easily insulted.

03:36.738 --> 03:40.073
Were you up all night researching this?

03:40.074 --> 03:42.308
You're welcome.

03:44.825 --> 03:46.328
- Good morning.
- Good morning, ma'am.

03:46.329 --> 03:47.714
The staff is ready to walk you

03:47.715 --> 03:50.050
through the schedule
for the state visit.

03:50.051 --> 03:52.052
The White House is very anxious

03:52.053 --> 03:53.887
that this week go smoothly.

03:53.888 --> 03:55.989
Tensions with the new French president

03:55.990 --> 03:57.590
don't poll well for this administration.

03:57.614 --> 03:58.458
- Morning.
- Morning.

03:58.459 --> 04:00.193
But neither does looking soft.

04:00.194 --> 04:02.396
Lèon Perrin shamelessly
flogs French nationalism

04:02.397 --> 04:03.363
during their election.

04:03.364 --> 04:04.765
He wins by the slimmest of margins,

04:04.766 --> 04:06.189
then immediately starts threatening

04:06.190 --> 04:07.701
to pull out of NATO.

04:07.702 --> 04:09.603
So, to express our
thanks, we're throwing him

04:09.604 --> 04:12.138
a nonstop four-day party.

04:13.106 --> 04:16.043
Safe to say some spin will be required.

04:16.043 --> 04:17.043
Good morning.

04:17.045 --> 04:18.245
Good morning.

04:18.245 --> 04:19.946
So, tomorrow's event will celebrate

04:19.947 --> 04:21.947
the anniversary of
the Battle of Yorktown.

04:21.949 --> 04:24.918
That will happen at Moore
House, which is where

04:24.919 --> 04:27.254
negotiations for
British surrender began.

04:27.255 --> 04:29.358
French Foreign Minister
Jean-Claude Dubois will speak

04:29.359 --> 04:31.558
and then a descendant of
the Marquis de Lafayette

04:31.559 --> 04:33.022
will introduce you, Madam Secretary.

04:33.023 --> 04:35.109
And my remarks will be rich

04:35.110 --> 04:36.930
with praise for everything French?

04:36.931 --> 04:38.965
Rich and thick, like a fine Barnaise.

04:38.966 --> 04:40.801
I need an update.

04:40.802 --> 04:42.569
Good morning, Russell.

04:42.570 --> 04:44.504
Yes.

04:44.505 --> 04:46.206
Fine. Good morning.

04:46.207 --> 04:48.975
State dinner, dner d'Etat.

04:48.976 --> 04:50.310
What's the latest?

04:50.311 --> 04:53.480
I'm coordinating with the
Office of the Chief of Protocol.

04:53.481 --> 04:55.415
You should have the final
menu and seating chart

04:55.416 --> 04:56.683
for approval this afternoon.

04:56.684 --> 04:58.218
Katy Perry is confirmed?

04:58.219 --> 04:59.486
Katy Perry is confirmed

04:59.487 --> 05:02.022
and seated on President
Perrin's right side.

05:02.023 --> 05:03.757
Excellent! It is vital

05:03.758 --> 05:06.393
to the future happiness
of everyone in this room

05:06.394 --> 05:08.195
and your loved ones

05:08.196 --> 05:10.330
this dinner goes off without a hitch.

05:10.331 --> 05:11.965
- We'll leave it at that.
- I am sure

05:11.966 --> 05:14.801
that President Perrin
will be suitably impressed.

05:14.802 --> 05:16.745
He's sitting next to Katy
Perry... He'll be fine.

05:16.746 --> 05:18.372
Does this concern have to do

05:18.373 --> 05:21.508
with Julius Burton, Robert Scott

05:21.509 --> 05:23.343
and Kenneth Foley, whose names

05:23.344 --> 05:26.179
just suddenly appeared
on the guest list?

05:26.180 --> 05:27.860
The billionaires who
withdrew their support

05:27.861 --> 05:29.622
when Dalton decided to
run as an independent?

05:29.623 --> 05:31.175
Celebrity businessmen who are

05:31.176 --> 05:34.421
passionate Francophiles and have
attended state dinners before.

05:34.422 --> 05:36.923
- They're back?
- They're circling.

05:36.924 --> 05:39.092
But this is not an
attempt to woo them because

05:39.093 --> 05:41.461
that could be construed as
mildly unethical, Russell.

05:41.462 --> 05:44.731
Which is why that is
not happening, Nadine.

05:44.732 --> 05:46.466
The polls are tightening

05:46.467 --> 05:48.602
since the last debate,
just to thrown in a crazy

05:48.603 --> 05:50.706
non sequitur that has nothing
to do with billionaires

05:50.707 --> 05:52.939
showing up to the state dinner.

05:52.940 --> 05:54.307
Look, every day

05:54.308 --> 05:55.675
we gain a little more traction.

05:55.676 --> 05:58.712
In New York and Minnesota, it's
practically a three-way tie.

05:58.713 --> 06:00.313
But there are only a few weeks left.

06:00.314 --> 06:02.297
If we're going to pull
ahead, we need to seriously

06:02.298 --> 06:04.184
up our game. That takes money.

06:04.185 --> 06:05.819
But... I digress.

06:05.820 --> 06:08.021
Let's just make sure

06:08.022 --> 06:11.992
everyone at the dinner has a good time.

06:11.993 --> 06:13.614
This might be an excellent opportunity

06:13.615 --> 06:16.034
for you and Julius Burton
to put aside your differences

06:16.035 --> 06:17.297
in the interest of diplomacy.

06:17.298 --> 06:19.365
And good times.

06:20.267 --> 06:22.102
You...

06:22.103 --> 06:23.904
stay out of sight while
the French are here.

06:23.905 --> 06:25.839
Why?

06:25.840 --> 06:27.641
The e-mail thing?

06:27.642 --> 06:28.905
You referred to Minister Dubois

06:28.906 --> 06:30.710
as an empty crêpe.

06:30.711 --> 06:33.580
In a private e-mail,
which was illegally hacked

06:33.581 --> 06:35.515
over two years ago.

06:35.516 --> 06:37.451
We apologized. It's forgotten.

06:37.452 --> 06:38.485
Really?

06:38.486 --> 06:39.753
The French forget?

06:39.754 --> 06:41.617
'Cause every representative
they send over here

06:41.618 --> 06:44.624
still manages to bring up
"freedom fries" at least once.

06:44.625 --> 06:45.758
I'll lay low.

06:46.493 --> 06:50.195
We can really win this thing.

06:50.931 --> 06:53.366
God, I hate hope.

06:53.367 --> 06:54.935
Interpol just ID'd our plate.

06:54.936 --> 06:56.536
What did they get?

06:56.537 --> 06:58.605
It belongs to a shell corporation

06:58.606 --> 07:00.574
called Quel beau Industries.

07:00.575 --> 07:02.275
I don't remember that
name being associated

07:02.276 --> 07:03.810
with any HS holdings.

07:03.811 --> 07:05.011
That's because it's not.

07:05.012 --> 07:07.046
It's a front for DGSE.

07:08.248 --> 07:10.116
French Intelligence grabbed Cecile?

07:10.117 --> 07:11.952
They must have been
running their own op.

07:11.953 --> 07:13.776
Probably tailing the
antiquities broker Cecile

07:13.777 --> 07:15.522
was in negotiations with.

07:15.523 --> 07:18.258
So, they grabbed her up to question her,

07:18.259 --> 07:20.260
not knowing she was an American asset.

07:20.261 --> 07:22.606
She's okay. She's with friends.

07:22.607 --> 07:23.578
Friends who just elected

07:23.579 --> 07:25.899
a right-wing president who's
threatening to bail on NATO.

07:25.900 --> 07:28.363
Things are pretty tense between
the U.S. and France right now.

07:28.364 --> 07:32.133
The spy code transcends politics.

07:34.887 --> 07:35.976
Our support got Conrad

07:35.977 --> 07:37.310
elected four years ago.

07:37.311 --> 07:39.246
Hell, we supported him four months ago

07:39.247 --> 07:42.716
before he got into bed with
Elizabeth "Save The Planet" McCord

07:42.717 --> 07:44.317
and screwed himself

07:44.318 --> 07:47.921
with all of her "rising sea
levels climate change" crap.

07:47.922 --> 07:49.990
Where were you to
talk him off the ledge?

07:49.991 --> 07:51.625
And why should we bail him out now?

07:51.626 --> 07:53.393
We didn't fly the coop
on Dalton, Russell.

07:53.394 --> 07:54.628
The party did.

07:54.629 --> 07:56.563
I hear you, guys.

07:56.564 --> 07:58.732
And the president hears
you; that's why I'm here.

07:58.733 --> 08:02.502
But if you guys have no interest
in coming back into the fold,

08:02.503 --> 08:04.271
why are you here?

08:04.272 --> 08:05.906
Courtesy, Russell.

08:05.907 --> 08:07.207
We're willing to hear you out.

08:07.208 --> 08:09.976
Or maybe you saw the latest polls

08:09.977 --> 08:11.778
that shows Dalton surging.

08:11.779 --> 08:12.946
I might've noticed.

08:12.947 --> 08:14.314
Who knew the electorate

08:14.315 --> 08:17.050
still had an appetite for
sane, steady leadership?

08:17.051 --> 08:18.985
Three cheers for America.

08:18.986 --> 08:21.855
But with three viable candidates
in the race, none of them

08:21.856 --> 08:23.890
will reach 270.

08:23.891 --> 08:27.460
- Sending the election to the House.
- Do you really think

08:27.461 --> 08:28.929
the majority will vote up Dalton

08:28.930 --> 08:30.997
ahead of their own party's candidate?

08:30.998 --> 08:35.302
I wasn't sure until I saw
Sam Evans get caught on video

08:35.303 --> 08:37.770
calling them the laziest
Congress in history.

08:37.772 --> 08:39.606
It's his 47% moment.

08:39.607 --> 08:41.174
Evans is a hothead.

08:41.174 --> 08:42.642
I don't love the idea

08:42.643 --> 08:44.277
of his sweaty finger on the button.

08:44.278 --> 08:46.513
And Fred Reynolds'
idea of a global economy

08:46.514 --> 08:49.082
is like that Stephen
King novel about the dome,

08:49.083 --> 08:52.018
except it's over the whole damn country.

08:52.019 --> 08:55.322
Come election day, Conrad
Dalton is going to do

08:55.323 --> 08:57.490
what even Teddy Roosevelt couldn't.

08:57.491 --> 09:00.360
He's going to win as an independent.

09:00.361 --> 09:02.629
And when that historic day comes,

09:02.630 --> 09:05.398
believe me, gentlemen,

09:05.399 --> 09:07.700
you're going to want
to be in his corner.

09:08.602 --> 09:10.704
Except there's no
corners in an Oval Office.

09:10.705 --> 09:12.405
And no fund-raising.

09:12.406 --> 09:15.442
But if you want to get
out your checkbooks here...

09:15.443 --> 09:18.845
I'll talk to Dalton on
Friday at the dinner.

09:18.846 --> 09:21.648
I reserved a table next to his,

09:21.649 --> 09:24.049
for you and your wives.

09:27.976 --> 09:29.389
I just can't believe that

09:29.390 --> 09:31.694
the French grabbed our agent
the same way Conrad is trying

09:31.695 --> 09:34.060
to build bridges with
the Perrin government.

09:34.061 --> 09:35.895
Should make for

09:35.896 --> 09:37.564
a pretty awkward state dinner.

09:37.565 --> 09:39.299
Your counterterrorism thing

09:39.300 --> 09:41.801
conflicting with my
foreign policy thing...

09:41.802 --> 09:44.304
What couple doesn't
have to deal with that?

09:44.305 --> 09:45.705
Right?

09:45.706 --> 09:47.774
I think they'll have
it worked out by then.

09:47.775 --> 09:51.144
I guess we'll see if spy code
really does transcend politics.

09:51.145 --> 09:52.836
Let's just say I have availed myself

09:52.837 --> 09:54.347
of it more than once.

09:54.348 --> 09:57.183
Not that I can discuss
any of that with you.

09:59.420 --> 10:01.286
You're very cute when you're covert.

10:04.157 --> 10:05.525
Hello?

10:05.526 --> 10:07.960
Okay, thanks.

10:08.728 --> 10:10.863
It's Captain Baker.

10:11.531 --> 10:12.799
I apologize

10:12.800 --> 10:14.234
for stopping in so late, sir,

10:14.235 --> 10:16.102
but I thought you'd
want to be briefed ASAP.

10:16.103 --> 10:16.970
You guessed right.

10:16.971 --> 10:20.340
- Hi.
- So, what have you got?

10:20.341 --> 10:23.410
As you know, Oliver Shaw
and I have been coordinating

10:23.411 --> 10:25.478
with FBI Cyber Crime Division.

10:25.479 --> 10:28.642
So, we've managed to isolate
your hacker's digital signature

10:28.643 --> 10:30.952
and trace it back to
an online payment system

10:30.953 --> 10:31.751
called BuckSend.

10:31.752 --> 10:34.821
Now BuckSend is popular
with the criminal underworld

10:34.822 --> 10:37.991
because it guarantees its
users complete anonymity.

10:37.992 --> 10:40.393
That would make it difficult
to learn our hacker's

10:40.394 --> 10:41.661
real-world identity.

10:41.662 --> 10:43.663
Correct, sir. But if I may speculate,

10:43.664 --> 10:45.632
the fact that he's on
BuckSend indicates to me

10:45.633 --> 10:48.801
that he's probably a mercenary
working for a third party.

10:49.803 --> 10:52.739
So, the hacker is just a hired
gun of our actual stalker.

10:52.740 --> 10:55.008
That's my educated guess.

10:55.009 --> 10:57.877
But finding him would
get us a step closer.

10:57.878 --> 10:59.345
That's what we're working on now.

10:59.346 --> 11:01.481
So, BuckSend's firewall

11:01.482 --> 11:02.949
normally is utterly impregnable.

11:02.950 --> 11:05.985
But, we have developed
a firewall-buster

11:05.986 --> 11:08.488
that's designed specifically
to defeat their security

11:08.489 --> 11:10.557
and get a brief look at the other side,

11:10.558 --> 11:12.926
but only while a monetary
transfer is in process.

11:12.927 --> 11:14.527
How brief a look?

11:14.528 --> 11:15.862
Approximately two seconds.

11:15.863 --> 11:17.864
Well...

11:17.865 --> 11:19.265
nothing like a cushion.

11:19.266 --> 11:21.768
No. Two seconds is
two billion nanoseconds.

11:21.769 --> 11:22.869
That's plenty of time.

11:22.870 --> 11:25.205
What if our stalker is
done paying our hacker?

11:25.206 --> 11:27.173
That would render our trace useless.

11:29.043 --> 11:30.710
- Let's think positively.
- Sure.

11:30.711 --> 11:34.280
Let's hope that this
guy pays his hired gun

11:34.281 --> 11:36.264
to hack into our car and
drive it into the Potomac

11:36.265 --> 11:39.185
or maybe pump some sarin gas
through our ventilation system

11:39.186 --> 11:41.488
and then you'll have two seconds...

11:41.489 --> 11:45.157
sorry, two billion nanoseconds...
to maybe get a name.

11:46.226 --> 11:48.928
Perhaps I should have waited
until I had even better news.

11:48.929 --> 11:51.196
I'm sorry.

11:53.099 --> 11:56.068
It's getting to us.

11:57.036 --> 11:59.639
I... I-I really appreciate

11:59.640 --> 12:02.507
everything that you
and Oliver are doing.

12:03.843 --> 12:05.845
Well...

12:05.846 --> 12:08.747
I'll let you get to sleep.

12:09.516 --> 12:10.917
Right.

12:10.918 --> 12:13.218
Right this way.

12:17.034 --> 12:17.857
Sorry to

12:17.858 --> 12:19.559
drag you in at the crack of dawn,

12:19.560 --> 12:22.261
but I figure if I was
lying in bed worrying,

12:22.262 --> 12:23.862
I might as well be sitting at my desk...

12:23.886 --> 12:24.764
It's no problem.

12:24.765 --> 12:26.299
I enjoy the traffic-free commute.

12:27.768 --> 12:30.203
Besides, you know, you're
always saying that we should

12:30.204 --> 12:31.604
clean out my coat closet

12:31.605 --> 12:34.140
and make room for my winter looks, so...

12:34.141 --> 12:35.408
Now we're talking.

12:37.000 --> 12:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:46.119 --> 12:47.387
Blake.

12:47.388 --> 12:48.447
Coming.

12:48.448 --> 12:50.039
_

12:51.090 --> 12:53.625
Yes, ma'am? What's wrong?

12:54.360 --> 12:56.561
Call the FBI.

13:01.967 --> 13:09.357
<b><font color="#33FF00">Subtitle sync and corrections by
awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.</font></b>

13:14.807 --> 13:16.141
I have to consider it.

13:16.142 --> 13:18.110
No. You are not going to quit.

13:18.111 --> 13:21.480
He's telling me what it would
take to make it all go away.

13:21.481 --> 13:24.082
That's all I want, Henry...
just for it to stop.

13:24.083 --> 13:25.784
You cannot give in to people like this.

13:25.785 --> 13:26.985
Why not?

13:26.986 --> 13:28.920
To keep our family safe?

13:28.921 --> 13:30.989
We're gonna catch this guy.

13:30.990 --> 13:32.923
I promise.

13:37.596 --> 13:39.564
My people are going
over all the offices,

13:39.565 --> 13:41.733
and we're pulling
surveillance from every camera

13:41.734 --> 13:44.253
- in the building.
- There are no cameras on this floor.

13:44.254 --> 13:46.238
No, but he swiped a
security card to get up here,

13:46.239 --> 13:48.502
and the number of individuals
with that kind of clearance

13:48.503 --> 13:49.641
is extremely limited.

13:49.642 --> 13:51.510
Ma'am,

13:51.511 --> 13:53.245
President Dalton has
requested to see you

13:53.246 --> 13:56.313
and Dr. McCord. It's
about Agent Cecile Zaman.

14:00.787 --> 14:02.854
I just heard. How you holding up?

14:02.855 --> 14:05.390
Well, it was a rough morning,
but the FBI's confident

14:05.391 --> 14:07.254
- they can catch the guy.
- How was that breach

14:07.255 --> 14:10.696
- even remotely possible?
- The FBI's looking into it now.

14:10.697 --> 14:13.432
And you guys have put all
your cards on the table

14:13.433 --> 14:15.199
about who this could be?

14:16.101 --> 14:18.537
I get paid to say the
stuff no one else will.

14:18.538 --> 14:19.638
It wasn't anyone

14:19.639 --> 14:21.373
- we know, Russell.
- Well, I hate to add

14:21.374 --> 14:23.707
to your troubles, but we
have another situation.

14:25.077 --> 14:27.646
Ephraim's negotiation with DGSE

14:27.647 --> 14:28.947
has hit a roadblock.

14:28.948 --> 14:30.949
They refuse to release Agent Zaman.

14:30.950 --> 14:32.250
On what grounds?

14:32.251 --> 14:35.053
The French claim American
intelligence rides roughshod

14:35.054 --> 14:37.689
over their authority,
pulling ops behind their back.

14:37.690 --> 14:39.024
A road that travels

14:39.025 --> 14:40.358
both ways.

14:40.359 --> 14:42.194
Which they refuse to acknowledge.

14:42.195 --> 14:44.996
Perrin's tough talk
about French sovereignty

14:44.997 --> 14:47.432
officially permeated every
corner of their government,

14:47.433 --> 14:49.101
including intelligence.

14:49.102 --> 14:50.769
The DGSE is threatening

14:50.770 --> 14:53.371
to make a public example of our asset,

14:53.372 --> 14:55.340
blowing her cover and your mission.

14:55.341 --> 14:57.804
- Which would expose them as well.
- Well, they say the broker

14:57.805 --> 15:00.412
they were tailing is a
low-level HS operative.

15:00.413 --> 15:02.236
They're willing to throw
that little fish back

15:02.237 --> 15:03.648
in order to make a larger point

15:03.649 --> 15:07.219
about bullheaded American unilateralism.

15:07.220 --> 15:08.920
And it couldn't have
come at a worse time.

15:08.921 --> 15:11.990
We're already taking fire from
all sides on this NATO issue.

15:11.991 --> 15:13.658
Conrad, listen, if the work

15:13.659 --> 15:15.961
I'm doing with Jose is causing
you any problems, please...

15:15.962 --> 15:17.562
Your work with Jose is vitally important

15:17.586 --> 15:18.864
to the safety of this country.

15:18.865 --> 15:22.501
HS can't be allowed to
get a foothold in Algeria.

15:22.502 --> 15:24.125
If we don't stop the
antiquities pipeline

15:24.126 --> 15:26.138
and cut off their cash flow,

15:26.139 --> 15:27.806
they will expand further into Africa.

15:27.807 --> 15:30.709
Which has far worse
consequences than one election

15:30.710 --> 15:34.212
or a cranky French president.

15:34.213 --> 15:37.581
Cecile Zaman's release
is our top priority.

15:38.416 --> 15:40.418
Minister Dubois and I will be together

15:40.419 --> 15:42.721
at the Yorktown commemoration.

15:42.722 --> 15:44.289
Maybe I can get through to him.

15:46.559 --> 15:48.360
Halt.

15:48.361 --> 15:50.024
When I was about six years old,

15:50.025 --> 15:51.997
my parents took me to Mount Vernon.

15:51.998 --> 15:53.465
Fire!

15:53.466 --> 15:55.400
Inside the main hall, I saw

15:55.401 --> 15:58.670
this heavy iron key inside
an antique glass case,

15:58.671 --> 16:01.373
and my father explained
that it was a key

16:01.374 --> 16:03.875
to a-a famous place in France,

16:03.876 --> 16:05.877
a place called the Bastille.

16:05.878 --> 16:08.380
At the time that struck
me as kind of weird.

16:08.381 --> 16:10.348
I mean, what was George Washington

16:10.349 --> 16:12.117
doing with a prison key

16:12.118 --> 16:13.952
from across the Atlantic?

16:13.953 --> 16:16.621
It was only later, when I
studied the French Revolution,

16:16.622 --> 16:19.691
that I understood what it really meant.

16:19.692 --> 16:22.694
The Frenchmen who fought
and died for this country

16:22.695 --> 16:26.097
did so because they knew
that what happened in America,

16:26.098 --> 16:27.866
as Lafayette once said,

16:27.867 --> 16:30.635
was "closely tied to the good fortune

16:30.636 --> 16:32.537
of all humanity."

16:32.538 --> 16:36.308
So today we pay tribute
to the people of France,

16:36.309 --> 16:38.677
whose sacrifice ennobles us all.

16:38.678 --> 16:40.544
Thank you.

16:52.357 --> 16:53.692
It's going well, ma'am.

16:53.693 --> 16:55.894
Can you believe this guy?

16:55.895 --> 16:57.128
Who's that?

16:57.129 --> 16:58.663
Foreign Minister Dubois. Every time

16:58.664 --> 17:00.065
he sees me coming, he heads

17:00.066 --> 17:01.609
in the other direction. It's a classic

17:01.610 --> 17:03.568
negotiating tactic. The
more I chase after him,

17:03.569 --> 17:06.003
the more control he
has over the discussion.

17:06.005 --> 17:08.740
Secretary Albright
actually taught me that one.

17:08.741 --> 17:12.229
I believe it was, Wendy Rogers

17:12.230 --> 17:14.613
who taught me another classic

17:14.614 --> 17:16.748
negotiating tactic.

17:16.749 --> 17:18.950
If a guy won't talk to you,

17:18.951 --> 17:22.319
send in a close companion
to bridge the gap.

17:23.556 --> 17:25.824
Wendy Rogers?

17:25.825 --> 17:28.159
The most popular girl in sixth grade.

17:51.983 --> 17:53.450
Formidable.

17:56.488 --> 17:59.291
Jean-Claude, I'm so glad to see you.

17:59.292 --> 18:01.960
Madam Secretary.

18:01.961 --> 18:04.729
Listen, we need to
speak about Cecile Zaman.

18:04.730 --> 18:08.400
I'm afraid your agent
must remain in custody,

18:08.401 --> 18:10.135
pending an investigation

18:10.136 --> 18:12.704
into her illegal
activities on French soil.

18:12.705 --> 18:16.608
Or... we could take a moment to tap into

18:16.609 --> 18:18.576
that spirit of cooperation

18:18.577 --> 18:20.845
that France and the U.S. have enjoyed

18:20.846 --> 18:22.414
for over two and a half centuries,

18:22.415 --> 18:24.683
and... just figure this out.

18:24.684 --> 18:27.919
President Perrin feels that our

18:27.920 --> 18:31.189
financial and military
obligations to NATO

18:31.190 --> 18:33.658
are egregiously high.

18:33.659 --> 18:36.761
We pay nearly a ten percent
share of NATO's total budget.

18:36.762 --> 18:39.496
We'd like to lower it to five percent.

18:41.499 --> 18:43.835
That's less than what Spain contributes.

18:43.836 --> 18:45.503
Those are our terms.

18:45.504 --> 18:47.839
I see.

18:47.840 --> 18:49.808
Well, in that case,

18:49.809 --> 18:51.376
I'll have to take action I was hoping

18:51.377 --> 18:53.311
to avoid. Tonight...

18:53.312 --> 18:54.713
the U.S. Department of Justice

18:54.714 --> 18:56.548
will issue federal arrest warrants

18:56.549 --> 18:58.650
for Marie Jordain, Erik Pisier

18:58.651 --> 19:01.052
and Jacques Richard.

19:01.053 --> 19:02.487
Those names mean nothing to me.

19:02.488 --> 19:04.022
They're assets that you have

19:04.023 --> 19:06.124
embedded in various American companies,

19:06.125 --> 19:09.294
mostly technology and aerospace.

19:09.295 --> 19:12.364
French spies... on American soil.

19:12.365 --> 19:14.766
We let 'em hang out here
because of the strong partnership

19:14.767 --> 19:16.101
that our countries share,

19:16.102 --> 19:18.737
but if you're telling me
that the party is over,

19:18.738 --> 19:20.561
well, then I guess we'll
just have to round up

19:20.562 --> 19:23.174
all of your assets and
charge them with espionage.

19:23.175 --> 19:24.709
Madam Secretary.

19:25.945 --> 19:27.912
Smile.

19:27.913 --> 19:30.815
Well, that was artless.

19:30.816 --> 19:33.385
You strong-armed the French
into releasing Cecile Zaman,

19:33.386 --> 19:36.154
and now President Perrin is
holed up in his hotel room

19:36.155 --> 19:37.922
avec Le stomach flu.

19:37.923 --> 19:41.259
He's sulking because I wouldn't
let 'em shortchange NATO?

19:41.260 --> 19:42.683
He's saying he won't be well enough

19:42.684 --> 19:44.562
to attend the dinner on Friday.

19:44.563 --> 19:46.867
And you can't have a state
dinner without a head of state.

19:46.868 --> 19:48.266
We'll have to cancel.

19:48.267 --> 19:51.703
Any hope of mending fences with
France will have been shattered,

19:51.704 --> 19:54.167
and all the progress I've made
with the donors will disappear.

19:54.168 --> 19:55.373
We'll fix it.

19:55.374 --> 19:56.541
You were supposed to fix it

19:56.542 --> 19:59.477
three hours ago! You
made the situation worse!

19:59.478 --> 20:02.713
Russell, pull yourself together.

20:04.249 --> 20:06.351
Listen to me. Bess.

20:06.352 --> 20:08.553
You're brilliant,

20:08.554 --> 20:11.856
and devoted, and a-and a
damn good secretary of state,

20:11.857 --> 20:15.093
but when it comes to a life in politics,

20:15.094 --> 20:16.561
you're a neophyte.

20:16.562 --> 20:18.863
It-It's something
you're giving a whirl.

20:18.864 --> 20:21.699
You-you can move on, unscathed.

20:21.700 --> 20:24.002
But I don't have a plan B.

20:24.003 --> 20:27.405
W-When I agreed to stay
on with this campaign,

20:27.406 --> 20:30.608
I put my reputation on the line.
I walked away from my party.

20:30.609 --> 20:32.343
I destroyed relationships

20:32.344 --> 20:34.679
that took 20 years to cultivate.

20:34.680 --> 20:36.548
I didn't just burn bridges behind me,

20:36.549 --> 20:39.317
I threw an... a hand
grenade into the empty air

20:39.318 --> 20:41.052
of my future career path

20:41.053 --> 20:43.887
and it has obliterated everything.

20:46.558 --> 20:49.294
If I'm going all-in...

20:49.295 --> 20:51.229
then so are you.

20:51.230 --> 20:52.697
I'll fix it.

20:52.698 --> 20:54.498
I promise.

20:56.634 --> 20:58.503
What?! Speak.

20:58.504 --> 21:00.738
Ma'am, Agent Santangelo

21:00.739 --> 21:03.273
needs to see you and
Dr. McCord right away.

21:04.008 --> 21:06.243
It-it's about the stalker.

21:07.112 --> 21:08.980
I'm gonna talk to the FBI,

21:08.981 --> 21:10.448
and then I'll deal with France.

21:10.449 --> 21:12.482
Yeah.

21:15.587 --> 21:17.348
The security card that was swiped

21:17.349 --> 21:18.549
to enter the seventh floor

21:18.550 --> 21:21.192
last night belonged to Diego Molina.

21:21.193 --> 21:23.795
A janitorial technician
with ZMG Industrial

21:23.796 --> 21:25.363
for the last eight years.

21:25.364 --> 21:26.631
They're subcontracted

21:26.632 --> 21:28.299
by State to clean the offices.

21:28.300 --> 21:29.567
I know Diego.

21:29.568 --> 21:33.037
He comes in when I'm working late.

21:33.038 --> 21:34.472
We talk about the kids.

21:34.473 --> 21:36.207
Could someone else have used his card?

21:36.208 --> 21:38.071
Surveillance cameras in
the elevator caught him

21:38.072 --> 21:40.906
on the way up with a can of
spray paint in his pocket.

21:41.646 --> 21:44.015
He had to know he'd get caught.

21:44.016 --> 21:45.850
- Maybe he didn't care.
- But why?

21:45.851 --> 21:47.714
He fought to get his
family out of El Salvador.

21:47.715 --> 21:49.254
He's built a whole life here.

21:49.255 --> 21:51.089
Why throw that away?
I don't know, ma'am.

21:51.090 --> 21:52.957
But El Salvador is where he's headed.

21:52.958 --> 21:55.527
After he vandalized your office
he drove to Reagan Airport

21:55.528 --> 21:57.262
and boarded a 10:00 a.m. flight.

21:57.263 --> 21:59.230
But we caught a break.

21:59.231 --> 22:01.032
Takeoff was delayed for three hours,

22:01.033 --> 22:03.268
so they're still in the air.

22:03.269 --> 22:05.837
I have agents on the way
to Ilopango International.

22:05.838 --> 22:08.406
They'll arrest Molina
as soon as he disembarks.

22:08.407 --> 22:11.643
Obviously, he was working for someone.

22:11.644 --> 22:13.478
But he should give that guy up

22:13.479 --> 22:15.813
when he hears what he's faced with.

22:15.814 --> 22:18.850
What? Vandalism?

22:18.851 --> 22:20.274
He had full access to the building.

22:20.275 --> 22:21.741
He didn't break in.

22:22.554 --> 22:24.656
And if there's a buffer
between him and the stalker,

22:24.657 --> 22:26.624
he may not even know the source.

22:26.625 --> 22:28.059
So, what?

22:28.060 --> 22:30.828
You want us to just let him go?

22:30.829 --> 22:32.597
Sort of.

22:32.598 --> 22:33.898
Let him go through Customs,

22:33.899 --> 22:35.700
then quietly take him into custody.

22:35.701 --> 22:37.168
That way, the actual stalker

22:37.169 --> 22:39.270
thinks Molina got away,

22:39.271 --> 22:41.306
and lets his guard down.

22:41.307 --> 22:43.241
And then?

22:43.242 --> 22:45.776
Then, you'll make him our asset.

22:53.911 --> 22:56.587
I got 20 texts from
Russell since 6:00 a.m.

22:56.588 --> 23:00.811
President Perrin has publicly
announced that he is too sick

23:00.812 --> 23:02.948
to attend the state dinner.

23:02.949 --> 23:05.083
And now Minister Dubois

23:05.084 --> 23:08.920
has taken ill with the same maladie.

23:08.921 --> 23:12.190
My photo op at the Washington
Monument's been canceled.

23:12.191 --> 23:14.426
Why don't you call Dubois's bluff.

23:14.427 --> 23:16.461
Despite all that posturing,
you know he likes you.

23:16.462 --> 23:18.365
Invite him out for a
drink, just the two of you.

23:18.366 --> 23:19.665
No cameras, no press.

23:19.666 --> 23:22.666
What French guy doesn't like
an expensive bottle of wine?

23:23.602 --> 23:25.470
Or cognac.

23:25.471 --> 23:26.738
Cognac, sure.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.240
Hey, Noodle.

23:28.241 --> 23:30.609
Sarah Watkins is having
a bunch of people over

23:30.610 --> 23:33.412
at her dad's house this
afternoon for a barbecue.

23:33.413 --> 23:35.396
Well, as long as your
homework's done, you can go.

23:35.397 --> 23:37.883
Make sure that Duncan and
Andy get a burger, will you?

23:37.884 --> 23:39.217
Are you joking?

23:39.218 --> 23:41.019
Mostly. But it would be nice.

23:41.020 --> 23:43.021
Do you know how embarrassing it is

23:43.022 --> 23:44.703
to have bodyguards
with me everywhere I go?

23:44.704 --> 23:46.807
Honey, I know it's not fun,
but it's not their fault.

23:46.808 --> 23:48.193
Their job is to keep you safe.

23:48.194 --> 23:50.062
Like Mom's office?

23:50.063 --> 23:51.296
That kind of safe?

23:51.297 --> 23:53.065
This whole thing is a joke.

23:53.066 --> 23:55.332
This guy can get to us anytime he wants.

23:56.335 --> 23:57.903
And just so you know,

23:57.904 --> 24:00.906
having Duncan and Andy
following me around...

24:00.907 --> 24:02.407
it doesn't make me feel safe.

24:02.408 --> 24:05.510
It just reminds me that I'm not.

24:05.511 --> 24:07.813
Henry.

24:07.814 --> 24:10.815
I know.

24:12.818 --> 24:15.153
I think I have a
solution to our problem.

24:15.154 --> 24:19.457
We can lift the ban on imported cheese.

24:20.359 --> 24:22.327
There's a ban on imported cheese?

24:22.328 --> 24:23.829
Not all of them.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.297
But raw milk cheeses

24:25.298 --> 24:27.041
have relatively harmless
levels of bacteria,

24:27.042 --> 24:29.501
and the FDA banned them
pending further study.

24:29.502 --> 24:32.537
Roquefort, Morbier
and Tomme de Savoie...

24:32.538 --> 24:34.072
to name a few.

24:34.073 --> 24:36.074
I like a Havarti party myself.

24:36.075 --> 24:37.709
I just hung up with the FDA,

24:37.710 --> 24:39.544
and they've agreed to
lift the ban this week.

24:39.545 --> 24:43.014
- Three months ahead of schedule.
- Really?

24:43.015 --> 24:44.816
A full three months?

24:44.817 --> 24:46.485
You're mocking.

24:46.486 --> 24:48.420
They want to leave NATO,

24:48.421 --> 24:52.190
not get a head start
on selling more cheese.

24:52.191 --> 24:53.492
It's apples to oranges.

24:53.493 --> 24:56.027
Or, really, more like warheads

24:56.028 --> 24:58.096
to active dairy cultures.

24:58.097 --> 25:00.098
So my plan is...

25:00.099 --> 25:02.800
Bit of an empty crêpe.

25:04.688 --> 25:07.112
- So they treated you well?
- Are you kidding?

25:07.113 --> 25:08.440
The coffee was better than home.

25:08.441 --> 25:09.904
And I'm pretty sure that the bedding

25:09.905 --> 25:11.376
had a higher thread count.

25:11.377 --> 25:13.178
Don't get me started on the bread.

25:13.179 --> 25:16.162
Well, if I'm ever abducted, I'll
make sure it's by the French.

25:16.163 --> 25:17.649
We're just glad you're okay.

25:17.650 --> 25:20.619
So. We know that French
agents debriefed you.

25:20.620 --> 25:22.020
Yes. But honestly,

25:22.021 --> 25:23.388
there wasn't much to tell them.

25:23.389 --> 25:26.491
The women that I met with
were very circumspect.

25:26.492 --> 25:29.194
They asked me a few questions
to confirm my identity,

25:29.195 --> 25:30.595
then we got down to business.

25:30.596 --> 25:32.731
- Did you meet the broker?
- No.

25:32.732 --> 25:33.932
He was in another room.

25:33.933 --> 25:36.735
They would send messages back to him.

25:36.736 --> 25:40.372
But I heard the women
refer to him as Bous.

25:40.373 --> 25:41.906
Or Bouseed, maybe.

25:43.208 --> 25:44.743
Bouseed.

25:44.744 --> 25:47.879
I think, that they are hoping
that Bouseed, or whomever he is,

25:47.880 --> 25:49.548
will lead them up the food chain.

25:49.549 --> 25:51.147
Okay. Thanks.

25:51.148 --> 25:53.474
- We'll talk again in a few days.
- Thanks, Cecile.

25:53.475 --> 25:55.620
Get home safely.

25:55.621 --> 25:58.824
...Bouseed.

25:58.825 --> 26:00.459
Does that name ring a bell?

26:00.460 --> 26:02.026
No. Should it?

26:02.997 --> 26:07.455
That report I read the other
night from our agent in Algeria.

26:09.269 --> 26:10.404
Here it is.

26:10.405 --> 26:12.139
"In the wake of Jibral Disah's death,

26:12.140 --> 26:13.474
"local chatter suggests

26:13.475 --> 26:16.310
"this growing HS faction is
poised to name a new leader,

26:16.311 --> 26:18.145
"Maaz Bousaid.

26:18.146 --> 26:21.081
"He's an expert in religious artifacts.

26:21.082 --> 26:22.803
"Has traditionally been
on the business side

26:22.804 --> 26:24.707
"of the organization,
but he's not being groomed

26:24.708 --> 26:26.253
to take over militarily as well."

26:26.254 --> 26:28.004
What are the odds it's not the same guy?

26:28.005 --> 26:28.765
Zero.

26:28.766 --> 26:30.510
But if they're listening
to his phone calls,

26:30.511 --> 26:32.293
why don't they know
he's getting promoted?

26:32.294 --> 26:34.328
Maybe he's smart enough
to know they're listening

26:34.329 --> 26:36.597
so the only thing he'll
discuss is antiquities.

26:36.598 --> 26:38.065
Or the French are being cagey.

26:38.066 --> 26:41.835
The French were willing to
blow up this whole operation

26:41.836 --> 26:43.370
by threatening to expose Cecile.

26:43.371 --> 26:45.372
If DGSE knew what they had,

26:45.373 --> 26:48.542
they would never have allowed
the bureaucrats to do that.

26:48.543 --> 26:51.579
Given relations now, if
we tell them the truth,

26:51.580 --> 26:53.547
they'll just cut and run with our Intel.

26:53.548 --> 26:55.249
They won't get far.

26:55.250 --> 26:56.917
France can tap Bousaid's phone,

26:56.918 --> 26:58.381
but they don't have the capabilities

26:58.382 --> 27:00.054
to track him remotely right now.

27:00.055 --> 27:01.315
For that, they need us.

27:01.415 --> 27:03.438
Of course, we need them
to give us the phone Intel,

27:03.439 --> 27:04.816
so we can track him.

27:05.637 --> 27:08.374
They got the chocolate,
we got the peanut butter.

27:08.375 --> 27:11.210
Recipe to catch terrorists.

27:11.211 --> 27:12.347
Look.

27:12.348 --> 27:13.988
I got to go and meet
Elizabeth at the FBI.

27:13.989 --> 27:15.555
- You'll give Ephraim a call?
- Yep.

27:15.556 --> 27:18.999
We'll figure out a way to get
our allies to play nice with us.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.768
Come on, Diego.

27:20.769 --> 27:22.436
Did you really think it's no big deal

27:22.437 --> 27:25.639
to vandalize the Secretary
of State's office?

27:25.640 --> 27:27.641
I thought maybe it was just a prank.

27:27.642 --> 27:30.511
You know, crazy powerful people.

27:30.512 --> 27:32.245
So someone asked you to do it?

27:33.247 --> 27:35.682
This guy on the Metro, on
my way home from work Monday.

27:35.683 --> 27:37.684
He must have been a
pretty persuasive guy.

27:37.685 --> 27:41.155
He offered me $500,000, cash.

27:41.156 --> 27:42.489
I thought he was nuts,

27:42.490 --> 27:46.794
and then he hands me this
knapsack with $10,000.

27:46.795 --> 27:48.862
Said it was a down payment.

27:48.863 --> 27:50.330
You know that kind of money...

27:50.331 --> 27:52.900
in El Salvador... My family...?

27:52.901 --> 27:55.835
What did he look like, this guy?

27:58.205 --> 28:00.174
He was wearing a hoodie, white guy,

28:00.175 --> 28:02.676
kinda skinny, tall,

28:02.677 --> 28:05.345
six-foot, or so.

28:05.346 --> 28:07.981
I've never been in trouble before.

28:07.982 --> 28:10.117
Well, you're in trouble now.

28:10.118 --> 28:14.321
We make these stalking charges
stick, you'll do 20 years,

28:14.322 --> 28:17.224
unless you keep cooperating.

28:17.225 --> 28:18.826
How did he pay you
the rest of the money?

28:18.827 --> 28:19.927
It's all on my phone.

28:19.928 --> 28:21.495
He told me to download

28:21.496 --> 28:23.697
this message program,
and then when I was done,

28:23.698 --> 28:25.232
to send a picture back to him.

28:25.233 --> 28:29.536
And then an hour later, there's $490,000

28:29.537 --> 28:31.472
in an account on BuckSend.

28:31.473 --> 28:33.974
So our stalker paid Molina

28:33.975 --> 28:35.776
the same way he paid our hacker.

28:35.777 --> 28:37.177
It's an opening.

28:37.178 --> 28:40.714
I've attached the firewall buster

28:40.715 --> 28:42.282
to Diego Molina's BuckSend account

28:42.283 --> 28:44.218
just like the one we
have for the hacker's.

28:44.219 --> 28:47.054
- So what's our next step?
- We bait the hook.

28:47.055 --> 28:50.157
We're gonna use Molina's phone
to take a photo of this burn bag

28:50.158 --> 28:51.343
of confidential documents,

28:51.344 --> 28:53.155
and send a message to
the hacker from Molina,

28:53.156 --> 28:54.712
saying he photographed the contents

28:54.713 --> 28:55.829
when he was in Elizabeth's office.

28:55.830 --> 28:57.750
If our stalker's interested
in seeing the photos,

28:57.751 --> 28:59.351
he can send Molina another hundred grand

28:59.375 --> 29:00.616
to the same BuckSend account.

29:00.617 --> 29:02.322
We don't think he'll be able to resist.

29:02.434 --> 29:06.003
And I'll be here to follow
the money back to our bad guy.

29:06.004 --> 29:07.471
It's an excellent plan.

29:07.472 --> 29:09.935
It might be a long wait.

29:09.936 --> 29:13.326
I can send an agent over in a
few hours to spell you, Captain.

29:13.327 --> 29:14.661
No need, sir.

29:14.662 --> 29:16.165
I'll be waiting here when he answers.

29:16.166 --> 29:18.398
Ma'am.

29:18.399 --> 29:20.422
Ephraim Ware is on the
phone. He says it's about...

29:20.423 --> 29:22.235
- France. Yeah.
- France.

29:27.319 --> 29:28.546
_

29:28.547 --> 29:30.410
Madam Secretary.

29:30.411 --> 29:33.146
Minister Dubois. I appreciate
you agreeing to meet with me.

29:33.147 --> 29:34.947
I'm feeling much better.

29:35.982 --> 29:38.083
Well enough for a sip of cognac?

29:41.921 --> 29:43.990
1788 Clos Du Griffier.

29:45.493 --> 29:47.927
The same provenance as the bottle

29:47.928 --> 29:50.196
that you brought on your last visit.

29:50.197 --> 29:52.198
In fact...

29:52.199 --> 29:53.700
it's the same bottle.

29:53.701 --> 29:56.636
- No, really?
- First time

29:56.637 --> 30:00.306
I've ever partaken of a diplomatic gift.

30:00.307 --> 30:03.476
Couldn't stand to see this
waste away in our gift room.

30:03.477 --> 30:06.613
Such sound judgment,
Madam Secretary.

30:08.015 --> 30:10.216
I remember you always loved this view.

30:10.217 --> 30:12.585
Yes. Yours is a beautiful city

30:12.586 --> 30:16.489
Designed by a Frenchman, of course.

30:16.490 --> 30:18.558
A French born American.

30:18.559 --> 30:21.127
Pierre Charles L'Enfant
eventually changed his name

30:21.128 --> 30:22.962
to Peter and lived out
his days in Maryland.

30:22.963 --> 30:26.466
Where he died in poverty,
forgotten by his adopted land.

30:26.467 --> 30:28.768
To the Treaty of Paris,

30:28.769 --> 30:31.371
which ended the American
Revolutionary War,

30:31.372 --> 30:33.473
and ushered in a new age of peace

30:33.474 --> 30:35.974
and free trade among our nations.

30:38.244 --> 30:41.614
Your policy expert
called me an empty crêpe.

30:41.615 --> 30:43.583
That was regrettable.

30:43.584 --> 30:48.354
And I apologize again on his behalf.

30:48.355 --> 30:51.724
Let's not keep going over the past.

30:51.725 --> 30:53.326
As I said over the phone,

30:53.327 --> 30:55.595
I want the U.S. and France

30:55.596 --> 30:58.097
to have better relations moving forward.

30:58.098 --> 31:00.032
Which is why I am here.

31:00.934 --> 31:04.270
We have a way to strike
a significant blow

31:04.271 --> 31:06.339
to Hizb Al-Shahid in Algeria.

31:06.340 --> 31:07.941
But we need your help.

31:07.942 --> 31:11.644
All we ask is that you are
open and transparent with us.

31:11.645 --> 31:13.246
To that end...

31:13.247 --> 31:16.482
we would like to extend
an invitation to France

31:16.483 --> 31:19.719
to become a member of
the Five Eyes coalition,

31:19.720 --> 31:22.288
joining with the U.S.,
Britain, Australia,

31:22.289 --> 31:24.057
Canada and New Zealand,

31:24.058 --> 31:26.258
in sharing all foreign intelligence.

31:26.993 --> 31:29.262
Secretary McCord,

31:29.263 --> 31:31.965
this is a very generous offer.

31:31.966 --> 31:35.301
One we don't make lightly.

31:35.302 --> 31:37.602
And there's a condition.

31:38.338 --> 31:39.806
If we agree to join forces,

31:39.807 --> 31:42.709
then France must maintain
its position in NATO.

31:42.710 --> 31:45.311
This is one of the oldest,
most hard-won alliances

31:45.312 --> 31:46.479
in the world.

31:46.480 --> 31:48.715
Think of the sacrifices that France

31:48.716 --> 31:50.550
has made to become a part of it.

31:50.551 --> 31:51.551
It would be

31:51.552 --> 31:55.121
a mistake of historic proportions

31:55.122 --> 31:57.456
to let it fall apart.

31:58.324 --> 32:01.995
I will convince President
Perrin to accept this.

32:01.996 --> 32:04.262
When he's feeling better.

32:04.998 --> 32:06.466
To his health.

32:10.169 --> 32:12.838
Now we need to talk about Maaz Bousaid.

32:19.641 --> 32:21.682
ISR and the French DGSE

32:21.683 --> 32:22.907
have confirmed that Bousaid

32:22.908 --> 32:24.715
and his entourage have
arrived at the compound

32:24.716 --> 32:26.461
just outside Tinzaouten.

32:26.462 --> 32:27.929
We think it's a fatwa council.

32:27.930 --> 32:29.164
HS is officially

32:29.165 --> 32:31.533
putting him in charge of
the Algerian caliphate,

32:31.534 --> 32:33.201
and the top guys are all there.

32:33.202 --> 32:35.880
We've identified lieutenants
from Syria, Libya and Iraq.

32:35.881 --> 32:38.216
Sounds like we made up with
the French just in time.

32:38.217 --> 32:39.317
It's a terrorist jamboree.

32:39.318 --> 32:40.451
It's our chance to strike

32:40.452 --> 32:41.820
a deadly blow at their leadership.

32:41.821 --> 32:44.155
- We'd cripple their entire network.
- Well, a joint

32:44.156 --> 32:46.357
French and American team
is spinning up in Morocco.

32:46.358 --> 32:48.793
Or we can have a drone
there in 20 minutes.

32:48.794 --> 32:50.662
- What about the artifacts?
- We believe

32:50.663 --> 32:52.064
they're being held in the warehouse

32:52.065 --> 32:53.408
right behind building number one.

32:53.409 --> 32:55.834
These pieces are incredibly delicate.

32:55.835 --> 32:59.070
E-Even the reverberation from a
drone strike could damage them.

32:59.071 --> 33:01.105
And I know that that alone is

33:01.106 --> 33:02.473
not reason enough to put

33:02.474 --> 33:04.042
our special forces in harm's way.

33:04.043 --> 33:07.512
But if we could capture some
of these high level HS guys,

33:07.513 --> 33:09.614
their computers, their phones...

33:09.615 --> 33:12.217
It's a trove of intelligence and assets.

33:12.218 --> 33:14.552
Has a recon team scoped out the site?

33:14.553 --> 33:18.156
Yes, sir. The French will set up
a cordon and blocking positions.

33:18.157 --> 33:19.620
Then our guys will hit the objective

33:19.621 --> 33:20.859
from the east and the west.

33:20.860 --> 33:22.763
And Algerian President
Cherat has already agreed

33:22.764 --> 33:25.365
to coordinate with our people.

33:26.097 --> 33:27.998
Let's do it.

33:32.905 --> 33:34.405
Left clear.

33:34.406 --> 33:36.708
Right clear. Room one clear.

33:36.709 --> 33:37.742
Nine enemies KIA.

33:37.743 --> 33:39.911
- 3 more captured.
- Copy.

33:39.912 --> 33:41.913
Engaging room two.

33:41.914 --> 33:43.615
Five Tangos on the stairwell.

33:43.616 --> 33:45.250
Fire left!

33:47.286 --> 33:49.453
Enemy down.

33:50.755 --> 33:54.725
- Grenade! Get down.
- Everybody down!

33:59.265 --> 34:02.032
Come on, come on.

34:06.404 --> 34:08.973
I need a sitrep!

34:08.974 --> 34:10.808
We take any casualties, Captain?

34:10.809 --> 34:12.309
Over.

34:14.245 --> 34:16.114
Negative, Admiral.

34:16.114 --> 34:17.647
We're all here.

34:20.118 --> 34:22.587
Securing computers,
files, all electronics.

34:22.588 --> 34:23.955
Copy that.

34:23.956 --> 34:25.924
Send in the birds and trucks, Captain.

34:25.925 --> 34:27.958
You've also got a lot
of old statues in there

34:27.960 --> 34:29.360
that need transport.

34:29.360 --> 34:30.728
Copy, Admiral.

34:30.728 --> 34:32.463
Out.

34:32.464 --> 34:33.598
Well done, everyone.

34:43.841 --> 34:44.876
How 'bout that?

34:44.877 --> 34:47.110
You didn't even get shot this time.

34:52.170 --> 34:53.184
Congratulations.

34:53.185 --> 34:54.319
Thanks. That was big.

34:54.320 --> 34:55.320
Yeah.

34:55.321 --> 34:56.754
And I got the go-ahead

34:56.755 --> 34:59.791
to offer the artifacts to
the French for safekeeping.

34:59.792 --> 35:01.893
Well, that should make the French happy.

35:01.894 --> 35:03.761
I just got off the phone
with President Perrin.

35:03.762 --> 35:07.165
He graciously accepted and then
made it sound like a burden.

35:07.166 --> 35:09.191
Well, he has been struggling
with that stomach flu.

35:09.192 --> 35:10.015
Surprisingly enough,

35:10.016 --> 35:11.703
he's feeling better and he's optimistic

35:11.704 --> 35:13.687
that he's gonna make the state dinner.

35:13.688 --> 35:14.839
Ma'am, Dr. McCord.

35:14.840 --> 35:16.507
Captain Baker's trace paid off.

35:16.508 --> 35:18.509
The FBI is about to arrest your stalker.

35:18.510 --> 35:20.777
Okay.

35:23.715 --> 35:26.084
His apartment's just around this corner.

35:26.085 --> 35:28.552
Let's hope he's not ahead of us.

35:35.660 --> 35:39.329
- FBI! FBI!
- FBI!

35:44.435 --> 35:46.137
Ron Janeway,

35:46.138 --> 35:49.007
we have a warrant for your arrest!

35:49.008 --> 35:50.907
Clear!

35:52.043 --> 35:53.878
Where the hell is he?

35:53.879 --> 35:55.013
Damn it.

35:55.014 --> 35:56.547
Suspect hiding in his bedroom.

35:56.548 --> 35:58.816
We got him.

35:58.817 --> 35:59.850
Is that him?

36:01.753 --> 36:03.254
That's him.

36:03.255 --> 36:05.223
You have the right to remain silent.

36:05.224 --> 36:08.226
Anything you say can and
will be used against you

36:08.227 --> 36:09.961
- in a court of law.
- It's over.

36:09.962 --> 36:11.323
You have the right to an attorney.

36:11.324 --> 36:12.691
If you cannot afford an attorney,

36:12.692 --> 36:15.165
one will be provided
for you. You understand?

36:20.795 --> 36:21.928
Julius.

36:22.292 --> 36:23.717
Elizabeth?

36:25.601 --> 36:28.135
This is my husband, Henry. Hey, Luce.

36:28.136 --> 36:29.874
Madam Secretary. You guys look great.

36:29.875 --> 36:31.509
It is a pleasure to meet you.

36:31.510 --> 36:33.010
Thanks, Lucy.

36:33.011 --> 36:35.412
Well, we should be in
for a wonderful evening.

36:35.413 --> 36:36.514
I certainly hope so.

36:36.515 --> 36:39.450
Are-are you waiting to see Dalton?

36:39.451 --> 36:41.552
Well, I wanted a little
talk before the dinner,

36:41.553 --> 36:43.854
but he got tied up on the
phone. They told me to wait.

36:43.855 --> 36:47.792
I hope we get a chance to chat. I know

36:47.793 --> 36:49.727
that we've had our
differences in the past,

36:49.728 --> 36:52.730
but I just want you to know
that I only want what's best

36:52.731 --> 36:54.965
- for this country.
- As do I.

36:54.966 --> 36:59.770
But I need to think about
what's best for my family.

36:59.771 --> 37:04.241
Recently, I've had to consider
stepping down from my position.

37:04.242 --> 37:06.243
Really? Why?

37:06.244 --> 37:08.112
We tried to keep it quiet,

37:08.113 --> 37:10.014
but Elizabeth...

37:10.015 --> 37:12.216
our family has a stalker.

37:12.217 --> 37:14.518
Incredible.

37:14.519 --> 37:17.121
I guess this-this sort
of thing can happen

37:17.122 --> 37:19.089
when you're in the public eye.

37:19.090 --> 37:22.359
An unstable person targets
you for some unknown reason.

37:22.360 --> 37:24.195
I imagine it's quite unsettling.

37:24.196 --> 37:25.696
Terrifying, actually.

37:25.697 --> 37:27.264
Yes. Well,

37:27.265 --> 37:28.766
I'm sorry for your troubles.

37:28.767 --> 37:31.202
And I hope you catch him soon.

37:31.203 --> 37:33.569
No, they already caught him.

37:35.907 --> 37:38.709
Well, that must be

37:38.710 --> 37:41.145
a great weight off. What happened?

37:41.146 --> 37:43.747
Started out by hacking
into our son's computer.

37:43.748 --> 37:46.050
That was part of a
sweeping campaign to spy

37:46.051 --> 37:48.652
on a number of political targets,

37:48.653 --> 37:52.256
just in case they weren't
in line with his agenda.

37:52.257 --> 37:54.058
He turned up the heat when he thought

37:54.059 --> 37:56.327
that I was influencing the president,

37:56.328 --> 37:59.797
specifically getting him to
adopt foreign policy positions

37:59.798 --> 38:02.499
that ran counter to
his business interests

38:02.500 --> 38:05.069
on climate change and rising sea levels,

38:05.070 --> 38:08.205
building bases overseas,
which, in turn, would threaten

38:08.206 --> 38:11.375
- his no-bid contracts with the
Defense Department. - Madam Secretary,

38:11.376 --> 38:13.244
this is all sounding a bit delusional

38:13.245 --> 38:15.546
- and paranoid.
- Why, Julius?

38:15.547 --> 38:17.443
'Cause it sounds like
I'm talking about you?

38:17.444 --> 38:19.686
- Wouldn't that be incredible?
- I'm not saying

38:19.687 --> 38:21.318
you did the hacking. I'm saying that

38:21.319 --> 38:23.520
you gave it to a guy
on your executive staff,

38:23.521 --> 38:24.822
Ron Janeway,

38:24.823 --> 38:27.524
who you thought would take a
bullet for you if he got caught.

38:27.525 --> 38:29.894
But, well, not so much.

38:29.895 --> 38:32.796
Someone at your level
trying to terrorize

38:32.797 --> 38:34.832
the secretary of state
into quitting her job.

38:34.833 --> 38:36.433
This is insane.

38:36.434 --> 38:39.470
If I wanted Dalton to fire
the secretary of state,

38:39.471 --> 38:41.105
I would tell him to.

38:41.106 --> 38:43.641
My support would be conditional.

38:43.642 --> 38:46.310
You tried that, and it didn't work.

38:46.311 --> 38:50.180
Loyalty is a tough thing
to predict in this town.

38:50.181 --> 38:53.150
Who do you think you're talking to?

38:53.151 --> 38:55.920
Presidents come and go, my friends.

38:55.921 --> 38:58.389
Policies are enacted
and overturned every day.

38:58.390 --> 39:00.057
But it is men like me,

39:00.058 --> 39:02.259
men with the vision
and, yes, the capital,

39:02.260 --> 39:05.863
to put that vision into
action, who really run

39:05.864 --> 39:08.332
this country. Dalton understands that,

39:08.333 --> 39:11.402
which is why he's been chasing
after me like a lost schoolboy.

39:11.403 --> 39:14.338
He can't win this election without me.

39:14.339 --> 39:17.675
So if you really care for
this man and his future

39:17.676 --> 39:19.276
and his legacy,

39:19.277 --> 39:20.978
you'll let this go.

39:20.979 --> 39:22.179
Julius.

39:22.180 --> 39:24.148
Everything all right?

39:24.149 --> 39:27.685
Conrad, I was just coming
by before dinner to tell you

39:27.686 --> 39:29.753
that I am back in your camp.

39:29.754 --> 39:31.422
Julius, I'm touched.

39:31.423 --> 39:34.424
But now the situation
is no longer that simple.

39:36.493 --> 39:41.031
Mrs. McCord has been making some
pretty outrageous accusations

39:41.032 --> 39:42.633
about my character.

39:42.634 --> 39:46.070
And while I hate to do it,

39:46.071 --> 39:48.706
I'm afraid I have to withhold my support

39:48.707 --> 39:53.043
until this situation gets
taken care of once and for all.

39:53.044 --> 39:55.012
I'm sorry to hear that.

39:55.013 --> 39:56.780
But in that case,

39:56.781 --> 39:59.115
let's deal with this right now.

40:01.719 --> 40:03.587
Julius,

40:03.588 --> 40:06.589
have you met the attorney general?

40:21.705 --> 40:24.274
Okay, so, let's see,

40:24.275 --> 40:27.778
we busted a stalker, we rescued
some priceless artifacts,

40:27.779 --> 40:30.314
took the fight to HS and saved Algeria,

40:30.315 --> 40:32.916
and we held together our most vital

40:32.917 --> 40:33.984
military alliance.

40:33.985 --> 40:35.586
All without offending the French.

40:35.587 --> 40:37.021
Well, the night is young.

40:37.022 --> 40:37.988
That's true.

40:37.989 --> 40:39.289
Jay has Minister Dubois

40:39.290 --> 40:40.924
cornered over there.

40:40.925 --> 40:43.293
Think he's trying to do penance
for that empty crêpe remark.

40:43.294 --> 40:44.628
Should we intervene?

40:44.629 --> 40:46.997
- Not yet.
- The other donors

40:46.998 --> 40:48.958
don't seem too upset that
their friend's not here.

40:48.982 --> 40:50.700
Are you kidding? They hate each other.

40:50.701 --> 40:52.124
They each upped

40:52.125 --> 40:54.370
their contribution when they
knew Burton had dropped out.

40:55.772 --> 40:58.274
Russell is hitting
that pâté really hard.

40:58.275 --> 41:00.859
- I think his wife must have left.
- Well, at least he's smiling.

41:00.860 --> 41:04.580
And he's... sort of
a normal color again.

41:04.581 --> 41:06.649
Hey, honestly, was there a split second

41:06.650 --> 41:09.051
when you thought he might try
to cover up the Burton thing?

41:09.052 --> 41:10.052
No.

41:10.053 --> 41:11.987
It was a full second.

41:13.690 --> 41:15.524
People coming through for you...

41:15.525 --> 41:16.892
never gets old.

41:16.893 --> 41:18.861
Wow.

41:18.862 --> 41:21.964
I just realized this is the
first time in a long time

41:21.965 --> 41:23.932
we don't have to be afraid to go home.

41:24.700 --> 41:26.602
You're right.

41:26.603 --> 41:28.604
We should celebrate.

41:28.605 --> 41:31.107
What do you want to do?

41:31.108 --> 41:33.142
Go home.

41:33.143 --> 41:35.044
Let's go.
