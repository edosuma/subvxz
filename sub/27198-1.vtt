02:06.693 --> 02:09.430
Come on, Marcus. Come on.

02:15.467 --> 02:17.003
Come on.

03:02.549 --> 03:04.448
I mean,
it's really good,

03:04.450 --> 03:06.551
but you... you gotta
fingerpick those.

03:06.553 --> 03:08.822
Strumming ain't gonna
cut it anymore. Look.

03:10.156 --> 03:11.624
Check it out.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.995
Gotcha.

03:26.305 --> 03:29.140
Can I... Can I hit that?

03:46.759 --> 03:50.862
<i>If we don't hit a new demo on
this first pass, then we're toast.</i>

03:53.799 --> 03:55.499
Mmm-mmm-mmm.
Stop it with that.

03:55.501 --> 03:56.936
It's not new.

03:58.472 --> 04:01.738
Oh, "You don't have to
be an athlete to sweat."

04:01.740 --> 04:05.041
That's the campaign. "You don't
have to be an athlete to sweat,

04:05.043 --> 04:06.376
Sports Aid." Done.

04:06.378 --> 04:07.946
<i>My God, that's...
You're a genius.</i>

04:08.948 --> 04:10.281
I gotta go
to Steven's show.

04:10.283 --> 04:11.882
Love you too.

You got a D, son.

04:59.164 --> 05:00.600
Hey, Mom.

05:02.869 --> 05:04.602
Hey. How'd they like it?

05:25.424 --> 05:27.525
This next one...

05:27.527 --> 05:30.061
This next one,
I did not write.

05:30.063 --> 05:31.162
Aww!

05:31.164 --> 05:32.765
But I think
you'll dig it anyway.

05:34.900 --> 05:37.936
I met the gal
who did write it

05:37.938 --> 05:42.105
on top of a water tower in a
rainstorm in Poughkeepsie.

05:43.242 --> 05:44.809
I was 19,

05:44.811 --> 05:49.347
and I was off my face on a
bottle of the hard stuff,

05:49.349 --> 05:52.451
stumbling through this field
when it started to come down,

05:52.453 --> 05:55.352
kind of rain you
could choke a frog with.

05:56.855 --> 05:59.157
So I ducked under this
water tower for cover,

05:59.159 --> 06:02.292
when all of a sudden, I hear
this girl screaming down at me.

06:02.294 --> 06:04.595
I look up, and she's
all the way at the top,

06:04.597 --> 06:07.264
and I can't tell if she's in
trouble, enjoying herself,

06:07.266 --> 06:09.367
or just
a downright loon.

06:10.703 --> 06:13.371
So I figured
I'd better investigate.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.476
Whoo!

06:17.344 --> 06:20.481
I thought I was gonna die
climbing up that thing.

06:21.414 --> 06:23.517
When I got to the top...

06:24.917 --> 06:28.852
I see Miss Drunken Angel
sitting across from me.

06:28.854 --> 06:31.521
I think, "Maybe I'm
already dead."

06:32.859 --> 06:34.025
And that, my friends,

06:34.027 --> 06:36.294
was the night
I met my wife.

06:40.667 --> 06:42.934
Do not let
the get-up fool you.

06:42.936 --> 06:47.170
She is deep, deep, deep,
deep undercover these days.

06:47.172 --> 06:50.574
At heart, she's still
the same sexy loon

06:50.576 --> 06:52.643
she was when we were 19.

06:52.645 --> 06:54.345
Yeah!
Come on, Maggie.

06:54.347 --> 06:56.581
Why don't you come up here
and help me with this one?

Language, mister.

08:29.609 --> 08:32.241
But it was pretty fucking
amazing, wasn't it?

08:33.645 --> 08:35.010
Anyone feeling
like putting

08:35.013 --> 08:36.679
blueberry syrup
on something?

08:36.681 --> 08:37.948
Waffle Stop?

08:37.950 --> 08:39.349
Yeah, you know it.

08:39.351 --> 08:41.049
Guys, I'd love to,
but I've...

08:41.052 --> 08:42.885
I've gotta get home and
get some work done.

08:42.888 --> 08:44.854
I didn't do shit!
I was...

08:46.058 --> 08:48.226
Go to the Stop.
I'll see you at home.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.961
That's what
I was doing!

08:49.963 --> 08:51.261
Steven, he's plastered.

08:51.263 --> 08:53.732
Just...
It's none of our business.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.599
Steven!
I know. Just...

08:55.601 --> 08:57.767
...didn't have to fucking
sleep with him, all right?

08:57.769 --> 08:58.870
I know
what you like.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.003
Hey, Jake!

09:00.005 --> 09:01.772
Jake, take it easy, huh?

09:01.774 --> 09:03.341
This is none
of your concern, Steve.

09:03.343 --> 09:04.775
I know.
It's none of my business.

09:04.777 --> 09:07.410
Just come over here.
Talk to me for a second.

09:07.412 --> 09:08.445
I'm okay, Steven.

09:08.447 --> 09:10.247
I know you are, hon.
I'm okay.

09:10.249 --> 09:12.315
I just wanna talk to Jake.
Come on, man.

09:12.317 --> 09:15.021
Take a walk with me.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

09:16.189 --> 09:17.188
Dad!

09:17.190 --> 09:18.488
Shit.

09:18.490 --> 09:19.490
God...

09:20.593 --> 09:22.593
Can we get
some help over here?

09:23.628 --> 09:24.697
Fuck!

09:25.598 --> 09:26.865
It's okay, hon.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.598
Come on. It's okay.
Just walk away.

09:28.600 --> 09:29.934
He's all right.
Come on.

09:29.936 --> 09:31.736
Let's get you
out of here. Come on.

09:32.772 --> 09:34.639
I'm sorry.

09:34.641 --> 09:35.805
Hey!

09:35.807 --> 09:37.341
Dad!

09:37.343 --> 09:40.047
Dad! Dad!

09:42.181 --> 09:43.780
Somebody
do something!

09:43.782 --> 09:46.250
Somebody help,
please!

09:46.252 --> 09:48.685
Please!

09:48.687 --> 09:51.322
Please!

11:08.700 --> 11:10.970
Marcus.

11:12.971 --> 11:14.941
What are you
doing there?

11:16.542 --> 11:19.309
Mm, I was hungry.

11:19.311 --> 11:20.644
Uh...

11:20.646 --> 11:23.116
how can you eat?

11:24.917 --> 11:25.949
Sorry.

11:25.951 --> 11:27.551
I'm sorry.

11:27.553 --> 11:28.852
You're hungry.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.788
Of course
you're hungry.

11:30.790 --> 11:33.560
I could make you,
um, eggs.

11:35.161 --> 11:36.394
No.

11:36.396 --> 11:38.862
Could make you a
grilled cheese with...

11:38.864 --> 11:40.233
There's no bread.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.036
Cereal?

11:47.072 --> 11:49.640
But with what?

11:49.642 --> 11:51.210
Vodka.

12:06.124 --> 12:08.458
I could make you
an excellent plate

12:08.460 --> 12:10.897
of saltines
and peanut butter.

13:01.714 --> 13:02.880
<i>Fine.</i>

13:02.882 --> 13:04.381
<i>Thanks, Phillip.</i>

13:04.383 --> 13:08.586
No, I just need some time
to get some stuff organized.

13:08.588 --> 13:10.286
And Marcus is having
a rough time,

13:10.288 --> 13:12.223
so I should be here for him.

13:12.225 --> 13:13.992
Give Blake those accounts
for the week.

13:13.994 --> 13:16.327
Tell him it was so sweet
of him to check in

13:16.329 --> 13:17.564
and that he'll do great.

13:19.165 --> 13:22.532
Also send me the keynote
on Sports Aid when it's up.

13:22.534 --> 13:27.106
Keep me in the loop,
Phillip. Thank you.

13:34.846 --> 13:36.582
Jane called, Mom!

13:38.484 --> 13:42.886
She and Seamus are coming
to take us to the store.

13:42.888 --> 13:45.789
What? Why?

13:45.791 --> 13:48.025
You said
we'd go shopping,

13:48.027 --> 13:50.162
and they offered.

13:56.902 --> 13:58.705
Fine.

14:03.475 --> 14:06.877
I can't believe your house
isn't full of food.

14:06.879 --> 14:11.383
When my mom died, my kitchen was
like an encyclopedia of casseroles.

14:14.653 --> 14:17.023
Oh, but you
didn't have a reception.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.056
No.

14:20.058 --> 14:22.526
All these people
we barely know

14:22.528 --> 14:24.962
have been calling
our house and shit,

14:24.964 --> 14:26.597
people I don't
even remember,

14:26.599 --> 14:30.501
like from the church I
went to when I was a kid.

14:30.503 --> 14:32.236
It's none
of their business.

14:32.238 --> 14:35.905
Exactly. Even like
Jake's fucking brother, Ted,

14:35.907 --> 14:37.875
the guy who works
at Quickie Lube,

14:37.877 --> 14:40.178
yeah, he calls the house
to tell me

14:40.180 --> 14:42.112
"how good of a man
your father was,"

14:42.114 --> 14:45.216
and how he "ain't gonna make any
excuses for his brother, but..."

14:45.218 --> 14:46.449
That's fucked, man.

14:46.451 --> 14:48.385
And I'm like,
"Leave me alone, dude.

14:48.387 --> 14:52.522
My dad hated you, and your
brother ruined my life."

14:52.524 --> 14:55.659
Yeah, my dad
hates that dude too.

14:55.661 --> 14:57.394
I'm sorry, man.
I didn't mean to...

14:57.396 --> 14:58.598
Oh, no, no. It's cool, man.

15:10.276 --> 15:13.644
<i>They're trying to finish three
campaigns by the end of the week.</i>

15:13.646 --> 15:15.746
<i>That Doritos thing
is a mess.</i>

15:15.748 --> 15:18.848
But we did get Russ
Leatherman to do the V.O.,

15:18.850 --> 15:19.949
which was pretty cool.

15:19.951 --> 15:21.886
I don't know
who that is.

15:21.888 --> 15:24.454
Oh, you know.

15:24.456 --> 15:26.692
You just don't know
that you know.

15:29.795 --> 15:31.962
That looks incredible.

15:31.964 --> 15:36.032
The <i>rucola</i> and the <i>basilico</i>
are from the <i>giardino.</i>

15:37.236 --> 15:39.203
Do you know
who Russ Leatherman is?

15:39.205 --> 15:40.838
No. Should I?

15:40.840 --> 15:43.341
<i>Hello, and welcome
to Margaret's phone.</i>

15:43.343 --> 15:47.712
<i>If Margaret is the name of the person
you wish to speak to, speak now.</i>

15:47.714 --> 15:49.012
The Moviephone guy?

15:49.014 --> 15:51.548
We went for drinks
after he did the voice-over

15:51.550 --> 15:53.550
and made him record
our outgoing messages.

15:53.552 --> 15:54.550
Cool, Mom.

15:54.552 --> 15:56.386
Pretty cool.

15:56.388 --> 16:00.123
Yeah. It's meant
to be ironic, Marcus.

16:03.863 --> 16:05.328
Pasta's really good.

16:05.330 --> 16:07.332
Marcus made it
after the game.

16:09.835 --> 16:11.367
Damn.

16:11.369 --> 16:15.005
I'm sorry. How was it?

16:15.007 --> 16:16.207
It was pretty good.

16:16.209 --> 16:17.573
I got a goal.

16:17.575 --> 16:18.910
And two assists.

16:18.912 --> 16:21.111
Sporting thighs
and pesto.

16:21.113 --> 16:22.545
College is gonna love you.

16:22.547 --> 16:25.216
By then, it'll be
the guitar that gets 'em.

16:25.218 --> 16:26.784
Girls do love a guitar.

16:26.786 --> 16:29.255
Dad says it
always works for him.

16:32.657 --> 16:34.127
Well?

16:35.728 --> 16:37.093
It works.

16:38.630 --> 16:41.567
I gotta say
it still works.

17:14.632 --> 17:16.667
Marcus. Marcus.

17:17.837 --> 17:19.305
Hey!

17:20.571 --> 17:23.406
I know you and your dad
were playing guitar,

17:23.407 --> 17:28.547
and I know he... he would
want you to keep it up, so...

17:29.881 --> 17:30.880
Now?

17:30.882 --> 17:33.349
Yes, now! Come on!

17:33.351 --> 17:35.354
Um, okay.

17:37.121 --> 17:38.021
Uh...

17:38.023 --> 17:40.193
Play the guitar, Marcus!

17:53.171 --> 17:54.805
Uh, okay.

17:54.807 --> 17:57.777
This is, uh, a C.

18:04.049 --> 18:05.918
There's a G.

18:10.188 --> 18:12.524
Don't you know
any actual songs?

18:16.628 --> 18:17.860
Um...

18:25.003 --> 18:27.340
Never mind.
Just do what you were doing.

18:28.607 --> 18:30.976
I wanted to hear a song.

18:49.160 --> 18:51.228
Yeah!

18:59.437 --> 19:01.171
Ooh!
Aah!

19:01.173 --> 19:02.571
Shit! Are you okay?

19:02.573 --> 19:04.774
He's okay. Here.

19:04.776 --> 19:06.009
Here you go.

19:09.947 --> 19:12.584
Ha ha! Shit happens when you
tussle with the trash can, tiger.

19:15.286 --> 19:16.455
Oh, hey, Marcus.

19:17.689 --> 19:20.057
I didn't
see you there, man.

19:20.059 --> 19:21.694
How you holding up, son?

19:24.129 --> 19:28.197
You know, you got a lot of people
praying for you. Know that.

19:28.199 --> 19:31.735
Barbara and I, we just feel
awful about it, you know?

19:31.737 --> 19:34.370
You know, Jake's
my baby brother and all,

19:34.372 --> 19:36.674
but ever since
he came back from the war,

19:36.676 --> 19:39.311
he just goes off
on a damn dime.

19:40.311 --> 19:41.243
Hey!

19:41.245 --> 19:42.413
Hey, motherfucker!

19:42.415 --> 19:44.213
Those are my new Dickies!

19:44.215 --> 19:45.982
Hey!

20:00.433 --> 20:03.267
Ooh.
Yeah, okay.

20:03.269 --> 20:04.667
Yeah, it is. It is.

20:04.669 --> 20:06.736
You should come in.

20:13.846 --> 20:15.678
Hey.

20:15.680 --> 20:16.848
Hey.

20:18.317 --> 20:19.616
You're not going in?

20:19.618 --> 20:21.684
Nah.

20:21.686 --> 20:23.720
Oh, come on.
Don't be a fraidy-cat.

20:23.722 --> 20:25.955
Seriously, Tracy, no.

20:25.957 --> 20:26.957
Okay. Sorry.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.161
I-It's fine.

20:31.163 --> 20:34.000
I'm just not really
feeling it right now.

20:37.535 --> 20:39.104
I get that.

20:48.045 --> 20:49.445
Whoo!

20:49.447 --> 20:50.749
Damn, Marcus!

20:53.452 --> 20:55.586
Shut up, Tony.

20:55.588 --> 20:58.955
The view? Really?
Okay. I guess so.

20:58.957 --> 21:00.957
Your mama's
so fat...

21:02.761 --> 21:04.494
I don't
even know. I...

21:04.496 --> 21:07.498
I got nothing.
I got nothing.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.002
Oh! Shit.

21:11.169 --> 21:13.470
Wow!

21:13.472 --> 21:14.840
Oh, my God.
Shit.

21:18.010 --> 21:19.846
Hey.

21:21.545 --> 21:24.714
Well, what are
the chances?

21:24.716 --> 21:26.517
I guess
they're pretty good.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.217
Why didn't anyone
invite me?

21:28.219 --> 21:30.422
I was at home.

21:31.456 --> 21:33.089
May I use this chair?

21:33.091 --> 21:34.593
Thank you.

21:39.732 --> 21:42.566
I tried to make
the chicken pockets

21:42.568 --> 21:45.703
that your mom
made me buy, but...

21:45.705 --> 21:48.204
whole house
smelled like grease,

21:48.206 --> 21:51.040
so I said pancakes.

21:51.042 --> 21:52.578
You know.

21:55.880 --> 21:57.447
Hi. Hi.

21:57.449 --> 21:59.049
Oh!
It's okay.

21:59.051 --> 22:00.584
It's okay.
Oh, I'm so sorry.

22:00.586 --> 22:01.551
Don't worry
about it.

22:01.553 --> 22:02.819
I'm so sorry.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.754
Come on, Mom.
What can I use to stop it?

22:04.756 --> 22:05.989
Okay. We should go.
I'm terribly sorry.

22:05.991 --> 22:07.390
We should go. Okay.
I feel awful.

22:07.392 --> 22:09.292
It's okay.
We'll get some pancakes at home.

22:09.294 --> 22:11.761
We don't have pancakes at home.
Excuse me.

22:11.763 --> 22:13.731
Get a little bit
of pancakes with syrup.

22:13.733 --> 22:16.133
We're gonna go now, okay?
I left my coat.

22:16.135 --> 22:17.434
I'll grab it later.

22:17.436 --> 22:19.536
I'm not going outside
with a fucking coat on.

22:29.881 --> 22:31.484
Sorry.

22:54.974 --> 22:57.875
<i>Hey, Margaret,
I-it's Grace.</i>

22:57.877 --> 22:59.876
<i>Uh, Phil asked me
to check in to see again</i>

22:59.878 --> 23:02.412
<i>if you wanted to approve
the presentation reel</i>

23:02.414 --> 23:05.315
<i>on Sports Aid before it
goes out to the client,</i>

23:05.317 --> 23:07.751
<i>so, um, he just
wanted to make sure</i>

23:07.753 --> 23:09.155
<i>that you were
in the loop.</i>

23:16.194 --> 23:18.261
That's foul.

23:18.263 --> 23:20.899
It's better
for my stomach.

23:26.605 --> 23:29.039
Are you watching this?

23:29.041 --> 23:30.510
No.

23:39.751 --> 23:41.851
<i>Hello, Mrs. Lang.</i>

23:41.853 --> 23:45.387
<i>This is Charles
from L.I.C. Leasing.</i>

23:45.389 --> 23:47.890
<i>I wanted to touch base
regarding the payment schedule</i>

23:47.892 --> 23:50.595
<i>on your 2016 BMW.</i>

23:51.897 --> 23:53.663
<i>If you could
just give me a call back</i>

23:53.665 --> 23:55.866
<i>on my direct line, I would
greatly appreciate it.</i>

23:55.868 --> 23:57.568
<i>Hi, Margaret.
It's Jackie.</i>

23:57.570 --> 23:59.301
<i>I'm just wondering
if we're still on</i>

23:59.303 --> 24:01.773
<i>for that yoga retreat next
weekend. Look, I know...</i>

24:22.226 --> 24:24.528
Howdy, stranger.

24:24.530 --> 24:26.297
How you doing in there?

24:26.299 --> 24:28.033
You know.

24:28.934 --> 24:30.767
We're going to get food.

24:30.769 --> 24:33.569
You wanna come?

24:33.571 --> 24:34.972
Uh, no, thanks.

24:34.974 --> 24:39.408
Um, I've got
some things I gotta do,

24:39.410 --> 24:42.212
cleaning
and stuff like that.

24:42.214 --> 24:43.214
Okay.

24:44.782 --> 24:46.651
Wait here for a second.

25:02.701 --> 25:04.637
Here.

28:21.765 --> 28:23.067
Mom?!

28:25.436 --> 28:27.039
Hey, Mom!

28:31.944 --> 28:33.676
Hey, Mom, could you
come up here

28:33.678 --> 28:35.013
and help me
with something?

28:39.917 --> 28:41.283
Yes.

28:41.285 --> 28:42.719
Ooh.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.423
Yes, Marcus.

28:45.657 --> 28:47.960
Everything here
is on auto-pay?

28:50.195 --> 28:51.429
Um...

28:52.496 --> 28:54.629
I think so, yes.

28:54.631 --> 28:58.571
Um, what about the account that
you put your paychecks in?

29:00.738 --> 29:02.739
Uh...

29:02.741 --> 29:04.674
Ooh.

29:04.676 --> 29:06.209
I c-can't do that.

29:06.211 --> 29:08.412
The mortgage
is not paid, Margaret,

29:08.414 --> 29:11.984
so I want you to sit in this
chair and help me, okay?

29:13.185 --> 29:16.187
Is there a file
that says "checking" on it?

29:17.455 --> 29:19.455
I think I could find it

29:19.457 --> 29:21.491
if it said
"checking" on it.

29:21.493 --> 29:22.325
Don't do that.

29:22.327 --> 29:24.394
Okay, fine. I'm sorry.

29:24.396 --> 29:29.030
Please just come
sit in this chair,

29:29.032 --> 29:31.867
and help me, okay?

29:37.842 --> 29:39.908
Look, I'll get your vodka.

29:39.910 --> 29:41.913
Just don't move.

30:02.501 --> 30:07.236
I'll sand the floors
<i>and</i> get toilet paper.

30:07.238 --> 30:10.074
<i>And</i> the fucking
tree stump.

30:11.243 --> 30:13.242
I almost hit it
again today.

30:13.244 --> 30:15.281
And the fucking tree stump.

30:17.983 --> 30:19.318
I'll take care of it.

30:20.819 --> 30:22.618
You'll see.

30:22.620 --> 30:25.957
I'll stick my chest out
and handle it.

30:49.179 --> 30:50.780
You picking up?

30:50.782 --> 30:52.618
Uh, yeah.

30:53.784 --> 30:55.018
Right, yeah.

30:55.020 --> 30:56.187
Of course.

30:57.554 --> 30:59.755
Get you the keys
to the truck.

30:59.757 --> 31:00.824
Thanks.

31:00.826 --> 31:03.529
Hey, I just, uh,
you know...

31:04.696 --> 31:06.165
Fuckin' people, man.

31:08.532 --> 31:09.702

32:03.420 --> 32:05.855
Just what I wanted
to do with my summer,

32:05.857 --> 32:07.190
learn
accounting software.

32:07.192 --> 32:09.858
My parents made me
learn to type last summer,

32:09.860 --> 32:11.027
four classes a week.

32:11.029 --> 32:12.462
Brutal.

32:12.464 --> 32:16.098
It totally was, but now
I'm a way better typer

32:16.100 --> 32:17.867
and texter.

32:17.869 --> 32:20.136
You are
a pretty fast texter.

32:20.138 --> 32:22.405
Mmm-hmm. So maybe
learning Quicken

32:22.407 --> 32:24.443
won't be a total waste
after all.

32:25.976 --> 32:27.245
Maybe.

32:29.414 --> 32:31.981
I just wish she'd
get her shit together.

32:31.983 --> 32:33.449
I hear you.

32:33.451 --> 32:34.751
But I don't know.

32:34.753 --> 32:37.854
Maybe just try
to be nice to her.

32:37.856 --> 32:40.423
She's going through
a lot too, and I just...

32:40.425 --> 32:41.890
Shh.

32:41.892 --> 32:44.092
What?

32:44.094 --> 32:46.831
You have
to stop talking now.

33:06.618 --> 33:08.984
Husband and wife
were sitting in bed.

33:08.986 --> 33:11.456
Spit. I'll wait.

33:15.627 --> 33:17.961
Husband and wife
were sitting in bed.

33:17.963 --> 33:20.262
Husband says,

33:20.264 --> 33:22.665
"Tell me something
that will make me

33:22.667 --> 33:26.735
both happy and sad
at the same time."

33:26.737 --> 33:30.639
And the wife considers this
and says, "Okay,

33:30.641 --> 33:35.313
of all your friends, you have
the most beautiful penis."

33:53.865 --> 33:55.300
Mom?

33:57.936 --> 33:59.301
Mom?

34:03.507 --> 34:06.744
Don't come in here.
Don't come in here, please.

34:12.784 --> 34:14.719
Don't come in here,
please.

34:22.293 --> 34:24.126
You brought food?

34:24.128 --> 34:25.862
Yeah, Chinese.

34:25.864 --> 34:28.167
Ohh.

34:29.701 --> 34:30.699
Okay.

34:30.701 --> 34:32.904
That was
really nice of you.

34:38.909 --> 34:40.576
It's okay.

34:43.980 --> 34:45.681
Thank you so much.

34:45.683 --> 34:47.016
Yeah. Oh.

34:47.018 --> 34:49.217
Thank you so much.

34:49.219 --> 34:50.585
Yeah.

34:50.587 --> 34:52.253
Thank you for taking
care of everything.

34:52.255 --> 34:54.123
Oh, yeah, sure.

34:54.125 --> 34:56.525
Mmm. Thank you

34:56.527 --> 34:59.728
for being such
a big, strong man.

34:59.730 --> 35:00.963
Okay.

35:02.766 --> 35:04.967
I just...

35:04.969 --> 35:07.869
I love you so much.

35:07.871 --> 35:09.304
I know it.

35:09.306 --> 35:11.743
So much.

35:15.013 --> 35:18.014
I miss you so much.

35:18.016 --> 35:20.652
I fucking miss you
so much.

35:21.918 --> 35:23.552
What the fuck?!

35:23.554 --> 35:24.554
Ohh!

35:25.456 --> 35:27.322
What the fuck?!

35:27.324 --> 35:29.125
Marcus!
No, that wasn't...

35:30.427 --> 35:32.494
Marcus, come here!

35:32.496 --> 35:33.663
You come here!

35:33.665 --> 35:34.866
Fuck you!

35:36.567 --> 35:38.837
Oh, my God.

35:41.304 --> 35:42.640
Oh, my God.

35:44.241 --> 35:45.910
Oh, my God.

35:51.482 --> 35:53.284
Oh, my God.

36:05.830 --> 36:07.032
Fuck.

36:09.034 --> 36:10.866
Marcus!

36:12.770 --> 36:14.804
Can you tell me
what this is?

36:14.806 --> 36:17.105
I'm sorry.
I had to pee after the game.

36:17.107 --> 36:18.507
I forgot
to take my cleats off.

36:18.509 --> 36:20.175
What did I tell you
about this floor?

36:20.177 --> 36:21.476
I don't know.

36:21.478 --> 36:23.012
You don't know,
or you don't remember?

36:23.014 --> 36:26.616
What do you want me to do,
Mom, cut my fucking feet off?

36:26.618 --> 36:29.150
All right, enough. Enough.
Don't get smart.

36:29.152 --> 36:31.087
It's not my fault!

36:31.089 --> 36:32.891
I'm not the bad guy!

36:34.558 --> 36:37.393
I don't give a shit
about the floor!

36:37.395 --> 36:39.862
You, go up,
and do your work.

36:39.864 --> 36:42.364
You, get back
in the kitchen,

36:42.366 --> 36:44.433
and cut
your fucking feet off.

36:44.435 --> 36:47.471
<i>You think I like
coming home late from work...</i>

36:48.438 --> 36:49.907
so you can roll your eyes...

36:52.576 --> 36:55.911
and whisper behind my back

36:55.913 --> 37:00.583
like I'm some fucking kind
of type-A cunt?!

37:00.585 --> 37:02.753
I'll sand it and
refinish it this weekend.

37:07.458 --> 37:09.961
<i>Nothing is irreversible.</i>

37:57.308 --> 37:59.574
Hi.

37:59.576 --> 38:02.344
I'm Betsy.
What's your name?

38:02.346 --> 38:03.679
Uh, Margaret.

38:03.681 --> 38:05.581
Are you coming
to the meeting?

38:05.583 --> 38:08.817
No. Hi.
I'm running errands.

38:08.819 --> 38:09.819
Oh, okay.

38:34.311 --> 38:35.980
Can I help you?

38:37.447 --> 38:38.850
I'm...

38:40.185 --> 38:42.621
just... just looking.

38:44.355 --> 38:45.353
Yeah.

38:45.355 --> 38:47.191
We get that a lot.

38:48.491 --> 38:50.561
Take your time.

38:52.063 --> 38:54.663
You know, so she claims
she kicked me out

38:54.665 --> 38:56.331
'cause I didn't
clean the roof.

38:56.333 --> 38:59.369
Heh. I know it
wasn't 'cause of that.

38:59.371 --> 39:02.938
So, you know, one night,
when I was high,

39:02.940 --> 39:05.541
um, I got
this grand idea

39:05.543 --> 39:08.478
I should go clean the
roof right now, you know?

39:08.480 --> 39:11.213
So, uh,
that's what I do.

39:11.215 --> 39:14.616
And, uh, I could hear
her yelling at me,

39:14.618 --> 39:16.617
but, uh,
I wasn't done,

39:16.619 --> 39:19.255
so I didn't
say anything.

39:19.257 --> 39:22.324
I just kept scrubbing that
fucking moss off the roof.

39:23.761 --> 39:26.295
So, yeah, it must have
looked a little weird

39:26.297 --> 39:28.331
when she came round
and saw me up there,

39:28.333 --> 39:31.036
especially since it was
the middle of the night.

39:32.503 --> 39:33.802
Man,
I don't know, man.

39:33.804 --> 39:35.538
I mean, I... Like,
my skin itches,

39:35.540 --> 39:37.974
and I'm...
I'm scared as hell,

39:37.976 --> 39:40.909
but I think... I think
that this is better.

39:40.911 --> 39:43.878
So I got
four days today.

39:43.880 --> 39:45.549
That's right.

39:48.118 --> 39:50.120
Four days, man.

39:52.123 --> 39:54.857
Hi. I'm Nancy.

39:54.859 --> 39:55.891
I'm an alcoholic.

39:55.893 --> 39:58.027
Hi, Nancy.
Hi, Nancy.

39:58.029 --> 40:00.730
I'm really grateful
to be here today.

40:00.732 --> 40:03.067
I'm grateful
for my sobriety.

40:04.067 --> 40:06.402
And I want
to say welcome

40:06.404 --> 40:09.771
to anybody new
that we have.

40:09.773 --> 40:12.574
So I put my phone number
on the first page, okay?

40:12.576 --> 40:14.576
Use it anytime,
day or night.

40:14.578 --> 40:16.445
Mine's in there too.
Thank you.

40:16.447 --> 40:19.050
I know this must be super
hard with your situation.

40:20.351 --> 40:21.616
Excuse me?

40:21.618 --> 40:24.253
Oh, you probably
don't know.

40:24.255 --> 40:27.322
I'm Tony and,
uh, Paul's mom,

40:27.324 --> 40:29.593
Nancy, Nancy Biddle.

40:31.094 --> 40:33.262
The boys were
really worried about you

40:33.264 --> 40:34.666
at the Waffle Stop.

40:36.134 --> 40:37.202
Hmm.

40:39.471 --> 40:43.206
But listen.
We all have our stories,

40:43.208 --> 40:44.910
or we wouldn't be here.

40:47.610 --> 40:50.346
I tried to steal
a horse once.

40:50.348 --> 40:52.447
You did what?
I did.

41:40.831 --> 41:42.130
Sorry about that.

41:42.132 --> 41:45.233
We're running
a bit behind.

41:45.235 --> 41:48.072
But then, we're always
running a bit behind.

41:49.873 --> 41:53.007
So when you testify,

41:53.009 --> 41:55.478
gotta be very straightforward,
what you saw,

41:55.480 --> 41:58.146
who was there,
what they did.

41:58.148 --> 42:00.884
You made a statement
to the police.

42:02.252 --> 42:03.753
I think so.

42:03.755 --> 42:05.753
You did, but for
the sake of clarity,

42:05.755 --> 42:08.590
we're gonna need to walk
through it one more time.

42:08.592 --> 42:09.793
You ready?

42:11.094 --> 42:12.763
No.

42:13.730 --> 42:14.963
Sorry?

42:16.667 --> 42:18.703
I'm sorry.

42:20.503 --> 42:23.074
Okay. I'm ready.

42:24.174 --> 42:25.174
You are?

42:29.447 --> 42:30.645
Hi.

42:33.985 --> 42:35.250
Shh.

42:35.252 --> 42:36.418
Marcus, sweetie?

42:36.420 --> 42:39.190
Your mom is here.

42:46.764 --> 42:48.163
What do you want?

42:48.165 --> 42:49.266
Hey.

42:50.835 --> 42:55.137
Um, there's
a preliminary trial next week,

42:55.139 --> 42:58.739
so I-I thought that maybe,
you know, you'd want...

42:58.741 --> 43:00.275
I don't want to.

43:00.277 --> 43:02.277
No, I'm sure
you don't want to.

43:02.279 --> 43:03.846
If I saw that guy again,

43:03.848 --> 43:05.850
I'd bash
his fucking skull in.

43:08.618 --> 43:10.854
- Marcus...
- What?

43:20.730 --> 43:22.364
I'm just gonna
leave this here.

43:26.237 --> 43:27.439
Just in case.

43:32.141 --> 43:34.076
<i>Look, they're gonna
open up his war record.</i>

43:34.078 --> 43:36.478
<i>They're gonna talk about
PTSD. Bunch of bull.</i>

43:36.480 --> 43:38.813
<i>Hey, no argument here.
Look at Butch Rose.</i>

43:38.815 --> 43:40.683
<i>He was out there
same as Jake.</i>

43:40.685 --> 43:42.250
<i>Same battalion.
Exactly!</i>

43:42.252 --> 43:44.652
<i>A-And now he's running
his dad's dealership,</i>

43:44.654 --> 43:46.721
<i>and he's doing great.</i>
Are we doing this thing?

43:46.723 --> 43:47.725
<i>I'm just stating...</i>

43:49.659 --> 43:50.958
Let's do it.

43:56.299 --> 43:59.800
So right in the middle of
this guy's shit-talking,

43:59.802 --> 44:01.570
Seamus whips
his dick out,

44:01.572 --> 44:03.973
and I'm like, "What the
fuck, man?" Right?

44:03.975 --> 44:06.175
But then he starts
pissing on the dude

44:06.177 --> 44:08.344
right in the back of
his leg, and of course

44:08.346 --> 44:10.279
he starts swinging
on Seamus,

44:10.281 --> 44:12.114
and I figure
I better do something,

44:12.116 --> 44:13.715
so I grab this two-by-four,

44:13.717 --> 44:17.119
and I hit him
right in the skull.

44:17.121 --> 44:19.855
It made
this crazy sound,

44:19.857 --> 44:22.224
like a...
like a hollow pop,

44:22.226 --> 44:25.728
like the dude's head was
empty or something.

44:25.730 --> 44:27.896
That's crazy.

44:27.898 --> 44:31.567
Yeah, that's a crazy story,
Marcus.

44:31.569 --> 44:33.703
Anyone want anything?

44:33.705 --> 44:36.007
Another beer?

44:38.141 --> 44:39.543

44:43.114 --> 44:44.382

44:47.717 --> 44:49.219
Hi.

44:51.721 --> 44:52.790
Hey.

44:53.924 --> 44:55.994
Can we talk?

44:59.797 --> 45:02.331
I know how hard
it must be.

45:04.268 --> 45:06.404
I mean, I don't know.

45:07.871 --> 45:09.374
I can guess.

45:11.475 --> 45:14.275
But I just...
I want you to know

45:14.277 --> 45:17.080
that you're not alone.

45:18.583 --> 45:21.116
Can you please not go deep
on me right now, Tracy?

45:21.118 --> 45:23.451
Just don't.

45:23.453 --> 45:27.322
This is the first real fun
I've had in a long time.

45:27.324 --> 45:29.027
This is fun?

45:31.929 --> 45:33.231
Sure.

45:46.643 --> 45:48.612
Stop it.

45:52.049 --> 45:54.215
I'm sorry for disturbing
your fun, man.

45:54.217 --> 45:55.619

47:56.940 --> 47:59.608
Well, that's all the time
we have for sharing.

47:59.610 --> 48:02.744
Before we go,
anybody, uh...

48:02.746 --> 48:03.913
Any burning desires?

48:03.915 --> 48:05.380
Anybody feel like
they're gonna drink

48:05.382 --> 48:08.186
or use if they don't
get a chance to share?

48:09.953 --> 48:11.953
I tried to kiss my son.

48:11.955 --> 48:13.922
What?

48:13.924 --> 48:15.190
Who are you?

48:15.192 --> 48:17.257
I'm sorry. I'm Margaret.

48:17.259 --> 48:19.295
I'm an alcoholic.

48:19.297 --> 48:20.999
Hi, Margaret.
Hi, Margaret.

48:31.275 --> 48:35.143
So I'm
pretty screwed up.

48:35.145 --> 48:36.911
Today is
my sixth meeting.

48:36.913 --> 48:38.980
It's my sixth day.

48:42.652 --> 48:45.587
I don't know
what to do next.

48:45.589 --> 48:46.656
I don't know.

48:49.993 --> 48:53.263
A few of us are going for pie and coffee.
Do you wanna come?

48:54.331 --> 48:55.764
Nah. I'm...

48:55.766 --> 48:58.199
I don't think I'm
up for that. Thanks.

48:58.201 --> 49:01.471
Uh, it wasn't
actually a question.

49:13.350 --> 49:15.183
Well, you know what? I...

49:15.185 --> 49:18.619
I am... I am actually
gonna go home, yeah.

49:18.621 --> 49:19.621
Want some company?

49:21.157 --> 49:22.590
Really?

49:22.592 --> 49:23.661
Really.

49:36.272 --> 49:38.475
It's really good.

49:41.112 --> 49:42.647
You think so?

49:44.982 --> 49:47.085
Yeah, I do.

49:48.217 --> 49:51.119
You did that
with a chain saw?

49:51.121 --> 49:53.387
And a chisel.

49:53.389 --> 49:57.127
Where does someone learn
to do something like that?

49:59.730 --> 50:03.768
I took
Sculpture in college.

50:05.101 --> 50:06.503
Who didn't?

50:13.610 --> 50:14.712
Thanks.

50:17.748 --> 50:20.717
So you're staying
with Seamus?

50:21.786 --> 50:24.152
For a couple weeks now.

50:24.154 --> 50:27.355
Shit got
pretty hectic at home.

50:27.357 --> 50:30.858
Ah. Thought you might
be hiding out from the cops.

50:30.860 --> 50:32.561
Why?

50:32.563 --> 50:33.695
You know.

50:33.697 --> 50:36.665
For beating down
that Quickie Lube guy.

50:38.235 --> 50:39.737
Nah.

50:41.038 --> 50:43.337
Cops around here
are weak, man.

50:43.339 --> 50:45.675
Couldn't do shit
if they tried.

50:47.011 --> 50:48.509
You know
that guy Jake,

50:48.511 --> 50:51.480
the guy
who killed my dad?

50:51.482 --> 50:54.849
Well, they're not
gonna do shit to him.

50:54.851 --> 50:56.921
That blows.

50:58.422 --> 51:00.558
That's why I'm
gonna do it myself.

51:01.891 --> 51:03.558
What the fuck?

51:03.560 --> 51:07.330
Dude, you can't
smoke in the house!

51:12.235 --> 51:13.938
Seriously,
what are you thinking?

51:15.139 --> 51:16.737
Can you leave?

51:16.739 --> 51:17.771
Don't.

51:17.773 --> 51:20.074
Yeah.

51:20.076 --> 51:22.710
I think
I'm gonna leave now.

51:22.712 --> 51:24.415
Bye.

51:27.384 --> 51:30.217
Man, can we talk?

51:30.219 --> 51:31.920
Sure.

51:31.922 --> 51:34.489
Look, I know you're going
through a tough time,

51:34.491 --> 51:35.757
but...
It's all good, man.

51:35.759 --> 51:37.525
I'm just gonna
go stay somewhere else.

51:37.527 --> 51:39.460
I don't want you
to stay somewhere else.

51:39.462 --> 51:43.163
I want you to stop acting like a...
a douche.

51:43.165 --> 51:44.465
What?

51:44.467 --> 51:46.736
I put the cigarette out.

51:50.206 --> 51:52.306
Yeah. Okay.

51:52.308 --> 51:54.444
I want you
to stay somewhere else.

51:58.047 --> 52:01.215
<i>Hey, Kevin, I just wanted to
say that I agree with you.</i>

52:01.217 --> 52:03.784
<i>This thing could go south
pretty quickly tomorrow.</i>

52:03.786 --> 52:05.853
<i>They paint him
as a war hero,</i>

52:05.855 --> 52:07.654
<i>you know, one who
got ruined by the war,</i>

52:07.656 --> 52:09.958
<i>a jury of his peers
might let him walk.</i>

52:09.960 --> 52:12.527
<i>It could happen.
It could happen.</i>

52:12.529 --> 52:15.230
<i>We just all gotta be prepared for
the fact that it could happen.</i>

52:23.973 --> 52:26.009
Dad! Hey, Dad!

52:57.007 --> 52:58.007
Hi.

53:05.516 --> 53:08.183
I've been really fucked up,
you know.

53:08.185 --> 53:09.920
I know.

53:12.121 --> 53:14.658
I wanted to apologize...

53:15.991 --> 53:18.361
and say that you
didn't do anything wrong.

53:19.395 --> 53:20.531
I know.

53:21.764 --> 53:24.800
I need you to know
that whatever happens,

53:24.802 --> 53:27.467
you didn't
do anything wrong.

53:27.469 --> 53:30.975
<i>Wh-What do you mean,
"Whatever happens"?</i>

53:35.212 --> 53:36.580
<i>Nothing.</i>

53:37.913 --> 53:39.681
I'm sorry. Um...

53:39.683 --> 53:43.720
I'm really fine,
but I've... I've gotta go.

53:45.355 --> 53:46.253
You're going
to the trial?

53:46.255 --> 53:47.792
Mmm-hmm.

53:49.558 --> 53:50.727
You want company?

53:52.996 --> 53:53.998
No.

54:51.721 --> 54:55.123
Marcus, you came.

54:55.125 --> 54:56.824
I'm gonna go up there.
You know what?

54:56.826 --> 54:59.259
I thought maybe that you'd
want to sit over here by...

54:59.261 --> 55:01.061
I love you, Mom.

55:01.063 --> 55:03.433
I love you too.

55:13.243 --> 55:16.078
Hey, Jake!

55:16.080 --> 55:17.880
Jake, take it easy, huh?

55:17.882 --> 55:19.413
This is none
of your concern, Steve.

55:19.415 --> 55:20.748
I know.
It's none of my business.

55:20.750 --> 55:22.884
Just come over here.
Talk to me for a second.

55:22.886 --> 55:24.253
<i>I'm okay, Steven.</i>

55:24.255 --> 55:26.121
<i>I know you are, hon.
I'm okay.</i>

55:26.123 --> 55:28.523
<i>I just wanna talk to Jake.
Come on, man.</i>

55:28.525 --> 55:30.161
<i>Take a walk with me.</i>

55:53.850 --> 55:55.518
All rise.

55:59.221 --> 56:00.223
Be seated.

56:04.427 --> 56:06.326
Before we continue,

56:06.328 --> 56:09.199
Mr. Walters, you wanted
to address the court?

56:12.134 --> 56:13.567
Yes, Your Honor.

56:13.569 --> 56:15.238
Go ahead.

56:16.773 --> 56:18.806
I want to plead guilty,
Your Honor.

56:21.043 --> 56:23.045
You understand,
Mr. Walters,

56:23.047 --> 56:26.884
that this plea precludes
your right to a trial?

56:27.984 --> 56:29.152
Yes, sir.

56:30.420 --> 56:32.820
And that you're
pleading guilty

56:32.822 --> 56:35.690
to murder in the second degree?

56:35.692 --> 56:37.525
Yes, sir.

56:37.527 --> 56:41.563
Mr. Young, you've spoken
with your client?

56:41.565 --> 56:43.864
Yes, Your Honor.

56:43.866 --> 56:46.634
Guilty plea is accepted.

56:50.040 --> 56:50.973
Okay.

56:50.975 --> 56:52.540
Something more?

56:52.542 --> 56:54.175
Yes, Your Honor.

56:54.177 --> 56:56.746
If possible, my client would
like to make a statement.

56:58.482 --> 57:00.083
Go ahead,
Mr. Walters.

57:14.864 --> 57:17.567
I know that I can't
change what happened...

57:19.936 --> 57:25.743
but if I could take back one
second of my shit life...

57:27.210 --> 57:28.612
it would be that one.

57:31.181 --> 57:32.583
I just...

57:37.420 --> 57:39.121
I got nothing.

57:39.123 --> 57:43.558
Sentencing will be
scheduled for a later date.

57:43.560 --> 57:45.092
Court is adjourned.

57:52.402 --> 57:54.067

It's closer down the hill.

01:00:01.730 --> 01:00:03.130
Hey.
You know?

01:00:03.132 --> 01:00:04.331
Because I go
down the hill.

01:00:04.333 --> 01:00:06.266
Oh, it's awful.
It was, really.

01:00:06.268 --> 01:00:08.302
It was really bad.
It's been hard since...

01:00:08.304 --> 01:00:09.670
Hey.
Hey.

01:00:09.672 --> 01:00:12.206
Can I... I need to speak
to you about something.

01:00:12.208 --> 01:00:13.208
Okay.

01:00:14.677 --> 01:00:16.378
So?

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:20.851
So apparently my... my son
has moved into the woods.

01:00:21.884 --> 01:00:22.983
Like, permanently?

01:00:22.985 --> 01:00:25.052
I assume not,

01:00:25.054 --> 01:00:27.320
but it's hard to know,

01:00:27.322 --> 01:00:29.523
since he's still
not talking to me.

01:00:29.525 --> 01:00:30.525
Sure.

01:00:33.163 --> 01:00:37.299
I mean, I have to respect
him for what he wants,

01:00:37.301 --> 01:00:39.567
and I really
can't fucking blame him

01:00:39.569 --> 01:00:41.069
for not wanting
to come home.

01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:43.172
Sure.
But...

01:00:44.808 --> 01:00:47.842
I can't let my underage son
live in the woods, right?

01:00:47.844 --> 01:00:48.809
Right.

01:00:48.811 --> 01:00:51.445
I mean, I-I have
to be his mother

01:00:51.447 --> 01:00:53.514
and... and take care
of him, right?

01:00:53.516 --> 01:00:55.119
Right.

01:00:58.822 --> 01:01:01.255
I don't know
how to do that.

01:01:01.257 --> 01:01:02.757
Sure you do.

01:01:02.759 --> 01:01:06.161
You just think, "What would
my mother have done?"

01:01:06.163 --> 01:01:07.994
and then
you don't do that.

01:01:10.866 --> 01:01:12.835
Right.

01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:15.703
Agh!

01:01:15.705 --> 01:01:18.208
Agh!

01:01:57.179 --> 01:01:58.214
Hey!

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:00.884
Hey!

01:02:02.552 --> 01:02:03.884
Hey!

01:02:03.886 --> 01:02:05.786
Hey! Hey!

01:02:07.824 --> 01:02:08.822
Hi.

01:02:08.824 --> 01:02:10.824
What are you doing?

01:02:10.826 --> 01:02:13.494
Camping.

01:02:13.496 --> 01:02:16.063
Really? Is that
what you're doing, Mom?

01:02:16.065 --> 01:02:20.333
You know, Marcus, I-I have a lot of
things to make amends to you for,

01:02:20.335 --> 01:02:22.837
but I-I feel like I should
start by apologizing

01:02:22.839 --> 01:02:24.639
for telling you
it was okay

01:02:24.641 --> 01:02:27.208
to ask a lot of rhetorical,
aggressive questions,

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:29.076
but it's just...
it's just rude.

01:02:29.078 --> 01:02:31.980
I'm in the middle
of the woods!

01:02:31.982 --> 01:02:34.148
I know.
How much more clear could I be

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:36.317
that I want to be
left the fuck alone?!

01:02:36.319 --> 01:02:38.052
Yes, I get it.
I understand,

01:02:38.054 --> 01:02:39.887
and I will
leave you alone.

01:02:39.889 --> 01:02:41.755
The problem
that I am facing

01:02:41.757 --> 01:02:43.757
is that I am
still your mother.

01:02:45.127 --> 01:02:46.828
Yeah, I know,

01:02:46.830 --> 01:02:48.996
such as I am.

01:02:48.998 --> 01:02:50.931
Why do you care?

01:02:50.933 --> 01:02:52.902
You never did before.

01:02:54.938 --> 01:02:59.373
You know, I don't really blame
you for feeling that way.

01:02:59.375 --> 01:03:02.879
I've made a lot of
really terrible choices.

01:03:08.351 --> 01:03:09.486
I...

01:03:11.154 --> 01:03:12.853
The only thing
I have left

01:03:12.855 --> 01:03:15.889
is that I am willing to stay in
these woods as long as it takes

01:03:15.891 --> 01:03:18.661
for you to figure your shit
out, until you come home.

01:03:32.875 --> 01:03:34.909
Okay.

01:03:34.911 --> 01:03:36.576
All right.

01:06:14.603 --> 01:06:15.603
Hi.

01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:21.710
I just realized
tomorrow's your birthday.

01:06:24.681 --> 01:06:27.317
You want to do
something special?

01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:33.554
Okay, I know that I'm
breaking the rules.

01:06:33.556 --> 01:06:35.659
I'm really sorry.
I'm going to go.

01:06:43.331 --> 01:06:44.931
Or maybe
could I just sit here

01:06:44.933 --> 01:06:47.169
and listen to you play
for a little while?

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:53.643
It's a free country.

01:08:55.330 --> 01:08:56.831
Hey, Jane.

01:08:56.832 --> 01:08:58.430
Hi.

01:08:58.433 --> 01:08:59.636
Yes, it's Margaret.

01:09:01.203 --> 01:09:03.970
Uh, is Seamus home?

about you giving,

not about him accepting.

01:12:05.187 --> 01:12:06.187
Okay.

01:12:08.356 --> 01:12:10.793
This is the long game, girl.

01:12:14.362 --> 01:12:16.031
What's the short game?

01:12:17.432 --> 01:12:20.102
Short game's an illusion.

01:12:33.516 --> 01:12:36.315
Hey.
Mrs. Biddle, what are...

01:12:36.317 --> 01:12:39.886
She's trying, Marcus. Do you have
any clue how hard she is trying?

01:12:39.888 --> 01:12:41.788
You don't know
what you're talking about.

01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:43.991
Hush. I know exactly
what I'm talking about,

01:12:43.993 --> 01:12:45.759
and you wanna know
what I think?

01:12:45.761 --> 01:12:48.028
I think you feel better
being mad at your mom

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:51.532
than just plain old sad about
your dad, and I get it.

01:12:51.534 --> 01:12:53.167
Mad, you can
do something with.

01:12:53.169 --> 01:12:54.600
You can punish
somebody with it,

01:12:54.602 --> 01:12:57.037
but I want you to listen
and listen good, kid.

01:12:57.039 --> 01:12:58.805
You have one life.

01:12:58.807 --> 01:13:02.076
You had one dad,
and he's gone.

01:13:02.078 --> 01:13:06.078
You have one mom, and she
is not, and she's trying,

01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:08.215
and while you're busy
wallowing over here

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:10.817
because nobody knows the
kind of pain that you're in,

01:13:10.819 --> 01:13:12.685
I have a friend who
just lost her husband

01:13:12.687 --> 01:13:14.520
who might be able
to understand.

01:13:14.522 --> 01:13:18.291
Now, I think it's cool that
you're doing what you have to do,

01:13:18.293 --> 01:13:20.293
because you're just a kid, and
you don't know any better,

01:13:20.295 --> 01:13:22.695
but this selfish
bullshit ends tonight.

01:13:22.697 --> 01:13:24.465
When you wake up
in the morning,

01:13:24.467 --> 01:13:27.067
I want you to start the next
year of your life fresh,

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:29.502
and you do that
by giving a shit

01:13:29.504 --> 01:13:31.637
about somebody
besides yourself.

01:13:39.115 --> 01:13:41.348
And happy birthday,
by the way.

01:14:02.937 --> 01:14:04.139
<i>Come on, buddy.</i>

01:14:55.290 --> 01:14:57.323
Oh!

01:14:57.325 --> 01:14:58.360
Hey.
Sorry.

01:15:00.161 --> 01:15:01.327
That's okay.

01:15:01.329 --> 01:15:03.865
Just l-let me
throw a sweater on.

01:15:14.075 --> 01:15:16.011
Did you have fun
at the party?

01:15:24.719 --> 01:15:26.188
It was
a really good party.

01:15:28.257 --> 01:15:30.360
I'm sorry I...
I wasn't there.

01:15:33.663 --> 01:15:35.865
This was probably
really a stupid idea.

01:15:37.732 --> 01:15:39.034
No, it wasn't.
