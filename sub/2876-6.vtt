00:13.722 --> 00:15.097
Hello.

00:18.143 --> 00:19.476
Hello.

00:19.936 --> 00:21.270
I love my new job!

00:21.563 --> 00:24.273
- Honey, you're screaming.
- You bet your ass I am.

00:24.441 --> 00:26.400
I just had the best first day ever.

00:26.568 --> 00:28.736
The kitchen?
Twice as big as Allessandro's.

00:28.945 --> 00:30.738
- Oh, that's great.
- Yeah.

00:30.989 --> 00:35.200
And clean? Not just Health
Department-clean, Monica-clean.

00:35.910 --> 00:36.952
Awesome.

00:37.328 --> 00:39.288
Oh, and the people are so nice.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.957
There's this one guy, Jeffrey,
he's the maître d'.

00:42.167 --> 00:44.293
Chandler, you will love him.

00:44.461 --> 00:47.254
He is without a doubt
the funniest guy I have ever met.

01:42.560 --> 01:45.229
- This is nice.
- I know.

01:54.322 --> 01:57.116
- You need both hands for that?
- Yeah, I kind of do.

01:57.283 --> 01:59.326
Well, how's this?

02:13.049 --> 02:16.718
Oh, look at you two holding hands.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.971
Is this getting serious?

02:19.305 --> 02:20.681
Well, I, you know...

02:20.974 --> 02:22.975
Have you not talked about it yet?

02:24.686 --> 02:26.728
Am I making you uncomfortable?

02:28.690 --> 02:30.899
If you were bigger you'd hit me, huh?

02:35.947 --> 02:37.030
I'm sorry, heh.

02:37.198 --> 02:41.118
It's obviously way too early
for us to be having that conversation.

02:41.369 --> 02:43.203
- Is it?
- Maybe not. Is it?

02:43.371 --> 02:45.205
Okay, when I got divorced...

02:45.373 --> 02:48.876
...I didn't think I'd feel this way about
someone for a really long time.

02:49.043 --> 02:51.879
Then again, I didn't think I'd meet
someone like you.

02:52.046 --> 02:56.258
And this may be crazy-soon,
but I want you to have this.

02:57.802 --> 03:00.262
- No, not... That's gum.
- Oh.

03:02.056 --> 03:04.850
Oh, five bucks.
I love it when that happens, you know?

03:05.018 --> 03:07.477
- You don't know it's there...
- I know. Keep digging.

03:07.770 --> 03:08.979
Oh, sorry.

03:12.609 --> 03:14.568
Oh. It's a key.

03:14.736 --> 03:18.113
To be honest, I think I'd prefer
the five dollars.

03:19.240 --> 03:21.700
- It's to my apartment.
- Oh, wow.

03:21.951 --> 03:24.369
Ooh. Big step for Phoebe and Mike.

03:24.537 --> 03:27.748
Look, I don't want you to feel like
you have to give me your key...

03:28.124 --> 03:30.667
- No, I want to.
- Oh, thank God.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.961
Yeah.

03:33.129 --> 03:36.089
Wow. I was starting to think
I'd never meet someone that...

03:36.257 --> 03:38.717
...you know, I wanted to do this with.

03:39.677 --> 03:41.303
Here you go.

03:42.931 --> 03:45.182
- This is cool, huh?
- It really is.

03:45.433 --> 03:51.063
Oh, I know it. It is amazing.
These little things open doors.

03:55.026 --> 03:57.027
So I don't go back to work
for another four weeks...

03:57.195 --> 03:59.238
...but we would like our nanny
to start right away...

03:59.405 --> 04:01.240
...so that Emma could get
a chance to know her.

04:01.616 --> 04:03.575
I think that's really smart.

04:03.743 --> 04:06.119
The easier we can make
the transition for her the better.

04:06.287 --> 04:07.329
That's great. Great.

04:07.497 --> 04:09.873
- So do you have any questions for us?
- Not really.

04:10.041 --> 04:12.376
All right. Well, thank you
so much for coming.

04:12.543 --> 04:15.128
- Thank you.
- It was really nice to meet you.

04:15.296 --> 04:17.798
- We will call you.
- Oh, you know, wait.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.675
- I do have one question.
- Yeah.

04:19.841 --> 04:22.803
Do you guys do random drug testing?

04:25.098 --> 04:27.808
Boy, we, uh,
hadn't really thought of that.

04:27.976 --> 04:31.937
That's cool. But if you do,
I'm gonna need three days' notice.

04:32.188 --> 04:33.563
Okey-dokey.

04:34.565 --> 04:36.817
Wow. We're never gonna find a nanny.

04:36.985 --> 04:40.529
Come on, Rach. We will. I promise.
We have more interviews.

04:40.697 --> 04:44.825
And worse comes to worst, we can always
reconsider the, uh, first one we met with.

04:45.076 --> 04:48.787
- What, the blond with no bra?
- She was blond?

04:51.374 --> 04:52.416
Just a sec.

04:52.792 --> 04:55.794
- Okay, this one's name is Sandy.
- Okay.

04:55.962 --> 04:59.214
She's got a degree in
Early Childhood Education.

04:59.757 --> 05:03.218
Uh, she worked for her last family
for three years.

05:03.386 --> 05:04.761
Okay.

05:06.139 --> 05:09.099
Hi. I'm Sandy.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.980
And she's a little mannish.

05:21.362 --> 05:25.073
- Ah! Oh, my God. David.
- Hi.

05:25.241 --> 05:29.536
- Uh, is this a bad time?
- No, it's a great time. Come in.

05:29.746 --> 05:31.830
Wow. Hi.

05:31.998 --> 05:35.208
Oh, my gosh. What are you doing here?
Are you back from Minsk?

05:35.376 --> 05:37.044
Well, just for a couple of days.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.796
I'm here to explain to the people
who gave us our grant...

05:39.964 --> 05:42.758
...why it's a positive thing that
we've spent all their money...

05:42.925 --> 05:46.219
...and, uh, accomplished, uh, nothing.

05:46.763 --> 05:48.722
Who cares? It got you here.

05:48.890 --> 05:52.059
Well, it got me to New York anyway.
Then I got in a cab at the airport...

05:52.226 --> 05:53.894
...and the guy said, "Where to?"

05:54.062 --> 05:57.856
I just gave him your address.
I didn't even think about it.

05:59.150 --> 06:01.360
Wow. Where's your luggage?

06:03.363 --> 06:04.821
Damn it.

06:06.407 --> 06:08.408
All right, I'll call the cab company.

06:08.618 --> 06:12.662
We can call them later.
Can you just stand there for a moment?

06:15.124 --> 06:16.291
Boy.

06:16.459 --> 06:19.294
There's an old Russian expression, um,
that goes:

06:23.466 --> 06:25.467
Roughly translated, that means, um:

06:25.635 --> 06:28.887
"This thing that I'm looking at: Wow."

06:31.099 --> 06:32.432
Thank you.

06:32.600 --> 06:36.186
Uh, no, you should see me when...
Actually, no, I look pretty good.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.772
Are you kidding?

06:38.940 --> 06:41.233
You know, when you don't see
someone for a long time...

06:41.401 --> 06:43.985
...and you kind of build them up
in your head, you start thinking:

06:44.153 --> 06:47.155
"Come on, don't be crazy,
nobody's that beautiful."

06:47.323 --> 06:49.825
But, well, you are.

06:51.744 --> 06:54.788
Well, so, um, are you seeing anyone?

06:56.374 --> 06:57.874
No.

06:59.335 --> 07:01.586
I'm just the worst person ever.

07:01.838 --> 07:04.339
How can I not tell David
that I'm seeing Mike?

07:04.549 --> 07:06.133
Maybe he didn't give you a chance.

07:06.467 --> 07:09.761
He said, "Are you seeing someone?"
And I said, "No."

07:11.013 --> 07:13.723
- Oh, well, that would've been your window.
- Yeah.

07:14.225 --> 07:17.644
I mean, I don't know.
I was looking in his eyes...

07:17.812 --> 07:21.398
...and I was just thinking,
"Oh, my God, it's David. David's here."

07:21.566 --> 07:23.984
He's just so irresistible.

07:24.360 --> 07:27.487
- Really? The scientist guy?
- Really? Chandler?

07:33.911 --> 07:35.662
Continue.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.998
Okay, then it gets worse...

07:38.166 --> 07:40.250
...because I told him
I would see him tomorrow night.

07:40.626 --> 07:43.879
- Phoebe.
- I know. Evil.

07:44.714 --> 07:45.964
And, and, and, and...

07:46.132 --> 07:51.553
I like Mike so much, you know?
It's just going really well. Oh, my God.

07:51.971 --> 07:54.097
Wow, isn't it ironic that David
would show up...

07:54.265 --> 07:56.766
...on the same day that
you and Mike exchange keys?

07:57.059 --> 07:59.227
Uh-huh.

07:59.437 --> 08:02.647
Yeah. You know, and given
my lifelong search for irony...

08:02.815 --> 08:04.858
...you can imagine how happy I am.

08:06.944 --> 08:10.447
- What are you gonna do?
- I mean, I guess I just have to...

08:10.615 --> 08:14.117
...tell David that nothing
can happen between us.

08:14.368 --> 08:16.578
Unless I don't.

08:16.746 --> 08:18.747
You know, complicated moral situation?

08:18.915 --> 08:21.583
- No right, no wrong?
- You have to tell David.

08:21.792 --> 08:25.545
I knew I should've had this conversation
with Joey.

08:28.090 --> 08:30.717
Funniest guy she's ever met.

08:30.885 --> 08:32.969
I'm funny, right?

08:33.346 --> 08:35.679
What do you know? You're a door.

08:35.847 --> 08:38.600
You just like knock-knock jokes.

08:41.229 --> 08:43.688
Save it for inside.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.525
- Hey.
- Hey.

08:46.817 --> 08:51.488
So Oklahoma's a crazy place. You know,
they call it the Sooner State.

08:51.656 --> 08:54.115
Frankly, I'd sooner be in any other state.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.703
And what's with Oklahoma
having a panhandle?

08:58.871 --> 09:00.580
Can all states have stuff like that?

09:00.748 --> 09:04.125
Hey, yeah, I'm from the, uh,
waistband of Wyoming.

09:04.335 --> 09:08.380
But when I was 7,
we headed over to the crotch.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.716
Was your cabin pressurized?

09:13.094 --> 09:16.137
And don't get me started on the way
the people from Tulsa talk.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.098
Okay.

09:19.225 --> 09:24.145
What's with the word "y'all"? You know,
just two words just pushed together?

09:24.313 --> 09:27.566
Are we all allowed to do that?
Because if so, I say why stop there?

09:27.733 --> 09:31.403
You know, your new poodle
could be your noodle.

09:31.654 --> 09:34.281
And fried chicken could be fricken.

09:34.991 --> 09:37.367
Waiter? Waiter, excuse me,
I'll have the fricken.

09:40.371 --> 09:42.038
See, that's funny with the fricken, right?

09:42.248 --> 09:46.876
No, it just reminds me of something
this guy did today at work.

09:47.044 --> 09:49.546
I told you about that funny guy, Jeffrey,
right?

09:49.714 --> 09:51.131
Yeah, he came up.

09:52.008 --> 09:56.303
Well, he did this bit.
You probably had to be there...

09:56.470 --> 10:01.141
...but it was Liza Minnelli locked
in our freezer eating a raw chicken.

10:01.434 --> 10:02.851
Oh, ha, ha.

10:06.063 --> 10:09.482
- Were you there?
- No, but it sounds fricken funny.

10:12.445 --> 10:16.448
I really understand how hard it's gotta be
to leave your child with another person.

10:16.616 --> 10:19.909
I mean, it's like leaving behind
a piece of your heart.

10:20.202 --> 10:24.247
Sandy, that's exactly what it is.

10:25.666 --> 10:29.252
- Are you gay?
- Ross.

10:29.462 --> 10:31.588
It's okay. I get that a lot doing what I do.

10:31.756 --> 10:34.716
- But I am straight. I'm engaged, actually.
- Oh.

10:34.884 --> 10:37.385
- Her name's Delia.
- That's pretty.

10:38.596 --> 10:43.516
So you're just, like,
a guy who's a nanny.

10:45.686 --> 10:49.022
I realize how it's a bit unorthodox
for some people.

10:49.190 --> 10:53.234
But I really believe the most satisfying
thing you can do with your life...

10:53.402 --> 10:54.903
...is take care of a child.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.988
Okay.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.034
Like at my last job.

11:01.202 --> 11:03.328
I met Daniel when he was
3 weeks old.

11:03.496 --> 11:07.123
And I got to watch him grow
into this awesome person.

11:07.291 --> 11:10.418
When I left, I said, "I'll see you soon."

11:10.586 --> 11:13.630
And he said to me, "Skadandy?"

11:15.466 --> 11:18.051
- That was his name for me.
- Oh, ha, ha.

11:18.219 --> 11:22.472
"I'll see you every day right in..."

11:28.771 --> 11:32.732
- It's okay.
- Yeah, kids say all kinds of crap.

11:37.196 --> 11:39.447
Oh, God, she must need
her diaper changed.

11:39.615 --> 11:44.327
- I can take care of that, if you want.
- Oh, that would be great.

11:46.831 --> 11:49.999
I love him, I love him, I love him.

11:50.167 --> 11:52.252
Oh, come on. Rach, he's a guy.

11:52.628 --> 11:54.713
So what? He's smart. He's qualified.

11:54.880 --> 11:57.048
Give me one good reason
we shouldn't try him out.

11:57.341 --> 12:00.719
Because it's weird.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.345
Why?

12:02.555 --> 12:05.014
What kind of a job is that for a man?
A nanny?

12:05.558 --> 12:08.268
I mean, it's like if a woman
wanted to be...

12:08.436 --> 12:09.728
Yes?

12:11.647 --> 12:13.481
King?

12:15.359 --> 12:18.903
I, uh, hope you don't mind. I used
some of my homemade lotion on Emma.

12:19.071 --> 12:23.199
It's a mixture of calendula and
honey cream. It'll dry that rash right up.

12:23.367 --> 12:26.494
Plus, it keeps the hands young.

12:33.294 --> 12:35.420
Yes. Sandy, you're hired.

12:35.796 --> 12:37.672
That's great.

12:41.552 --> 12:42.635
I'm sorry.

12:42.803 --> 12:46.264
It's just such an emotional thing
when you're welcomed into a new family.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.766
Oh, God. Come here.

12:51.812 --> 12:53.813
You gotta be at least bi.

13:02.490 --> 13:03.531
Hey.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.083
I need you to set me up for a joke.

13:14.251 --> 13:16.711
When Monica's around,
ask me about fire trucks.

13:16.921 --> 13:21.883
Ooh, I don't know, Chandler.
I'm not so good with remembering lines.

13:24.303 --> 13:26.846
Well, thank God your livelihood
doesn't depend on it.

13:27.014 --> 13:28.848
I know, right?

13:29.850 --> 13:31.351
Why are we doing this?

13:31.602 --> 13:35.146
Monica says that her maître d'
is the funniest guy she's ever met.

13:35.314 --> 13:39.317
- Seriously? She actually said that?
- Yes. Am I crazy to be this upset?

13:39.485 --> 13:42.529
- No. Being funny's your thing.
- Yeah.

13:42.696 --> 13:45.198
Without that, you just got
"lame with women."

13:47.159 --> 13:48.326
Hi. There you are.

13:48.494 --> 13:49.744
Fire trucks.

14:00.881 --> 14:04.968
Wow. You look even more beautiful
than you did yesterday.

14:05.678 --> 14:09.222
- Ooh.
- In fact, I'm going to kiss you now.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.350
- Oh, wait, wait.
- Yeah, I can't get away with stuff like that.

14:12.518 --> 14:15.520
It sounded sexy in my head, so I...

14:15.771 --> 14:17.897
No, no, it's not that.

14:19.525 --> 14:23.319
Remember when you asked me
if I was seeing someone and I said no?

14:23.487 --> 14:29.993
- Well, um, I am. His name's Mike.
- Oh. Oh.

14:30.286 --> 14:33.371
- I should've told you.
- No.

14:34.123 --> 14:36.165
- Well, yeah.
- Yeah.

14:36.792 --> 14:42.046
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Well, it's okay. I understand.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.757
Well, are you happy with this guy?

14:45.092 --> 14:47.051
- I am happy.
- Damn it.

14:47.761 --> 14:50.680
I'm sorry. I don't mean that.
I want you to be happy.

14:50.848 --> 14:54.142
But only with me. No, that's not fair.
Who cares. Leave him.

14:54.310 --> 14:57.687
I don't mean that. Yes, I do.
I'm sorry. Um...

14:57.855 --> 15:02.108
- I think I should probably, uh, go.
- Well...

15:02.526 --> 15:06.321
But, David, I just want you to know that,
you know...

15:06.572 --> 15:11.075
...telling you this is one of the
hardest things I've ever had to do.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.995
Well, just so you know...

15:14.163 --> 15:17.290
...hearing it wasn't exactly
a Vladnik carnival, either.

15:19.376 --> 15:23.796
- Can we at least hug goodbye?
- Of course. Yeah.

15:31.138 --> 15:34.849
You know, and a kiss on the cheek
wouldn't be totally inappropriate.

15:35.017 --> 15:37.810
- No. No.
- I mean...

15:40.856 --> 15:42.190
- In Minsk?
- Yeah?

15:42.358 --> 15:44.984
- It's, um, two on each cheek...
- Mm-hm.

15:45.152 --> 15:48.821
...and, uh, one on the lips.
- Well, if that's what they do in Minsk...

15:55.663 --> 15:57.997
In New York, it's...

16:06.715 --> 16:08.257
Oh, boy.

16:10.552 --> 16:11.719
Hi.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.180
Is everything all right?

16:14.431 --> 16:16.557
Oh, yeah. No, it's fine. It's fine.

16:16.725 --> 16:20.561
Sandy was just telling me about how he
proposed to his fiancée...

16:20.813 --> 16:22.605
...and it was so beautiful.

16:22.982 --> 16:26.025
Well, her favorite flower is the camellia.
From the poem...

16:26.318 --> 16:27.777
I can't hear it again.

16:27.945 --> 16:30.947
You know, I can't tell it again.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.491
And I'm fine never having heard it.

16:35.619 --> 16:40.331
- Rach, can I see you for a sec?
- Yeah. Excuse me.

16:43.419 --> 16:48.965
Do you realize that man has cried
in our apartment three times? Huh?

16:49.133 --> 16:52.176
I haven't cried that many times
since I moved in.

16:52.428 --> 16:55.722
Look, Ross, Sandy's just sensitive.
That's all.

16:55.889 --> 17:00.309
Okay, okay. See, that is the problem.
He is too sensitive.

17:00.561 --> 17:02.437
Too sensitive to take care of our baby?

17:02.646 --> 17:05.940
No, I mean, all I'm saying is that guy...
These are amazing.

17:07.067 --> 17:09.027
Sandy made madeleines.

17:09.278 --> 17:12.488
This is exactly
what I'm talking about.

17:14.116 --> 17:18.202
What kind of a guy makes delicate
French cookies? Huh?

17:18.369 --> 17:21.830
They're not even butch,
manly cookies with...

17:21.999 --> 17:25.126
You know, with chunks.

17:28.672 --> 17:31.424
Well, you know,
I don't know what to say.

17:31.592 --> 17:35.511
I mean, I never thought of you as a guy
who needed his men to be men.

17:35.679 --> 17:39.140
I gotta tell you, Ross, it's not like you
just came in from branding cattle.

17:44.521 --> 17:48.399
Hey, there's sensitive
and there's too sensitive.

17:48.650 --> 17:51.444
Okay, what is too sensitive?

18:16.595 --> 18:19.263
No, I can't. I can't do this. It's bad.

18:19.848 --> 18:24.185
- But it's nice. And nice is good.
- Mm-hm.

18:24.353 --> 18:27.939
And good is not bad.
Ergo, we should keep kissing.

18:28.315 --> 18:30.650
- No, no. No.
- But...

18:31.568 --> 18:33.236
Ergo.

18:34.696 --> 18:37.657
Look, David, if you had never left, then...

18:37.825 --> 18:40.576
...yeah, we'd probably still be together
right now.

18:40.744 --> 18:47.208
But you did leave. And I'm with Mike,
and I really care about him.

18:49.920 --> 18:54.298
Well, um, goodbye. Uh...

19:00.764 --> 19:03.015
Well, the key works.

19:04.601 --> 19:07.520
And, you, thanks for the face massage.
Thank you.

19:10.941 --> 19:13.651
Did Rachel tell you we hired
a male nanny?

19:13.819 --> 19:15.945
- Yeah. I think that's great.
- Oh, really?

19:16.321 --> 19:21.784
Did she tell you he plays the recorder,
recites poetry and bakes madeleines?

19:23.328 --> 19:28.249
- Oh. How are they?
- Lighter than air, but that's not the point.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.544
- Hey.
- Hey.

19:31.712 --> 19:33.963
Rachel and I hired a male nanny.

19:34.923 --> 19:36.382
Really?

19:36.550 --> 19:38.634
Guys do that?

19:38.802 --> 19:40.845
- That's weird.
- Thank you.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.681
- That's like a woman wanting to be a...
- What?

19:43.849 --> 19:47.435
- What's the end of that sentence?
- Yes. What is the end of that sentence?

19:47.895 --> 19:50.062
Uh...

19:50.689 --> 19:52.523
A penis model.

19:58.113 --> 20:01.032
Anyway, hey, did you tell Chandler
that some guy from work...

20:01.200 --> 20:03.075
...is the funniest guy you ever met?

20:03.243 --> 20:06.412
- Yeah. So?
- Wow.

20:07.164 --> 20:09.540
Really? Do you not know Chandler?

20:11.210 --> 20:15.963
Is that why he's acting so weird?
He's jealous?

20:16.131 --> 20:17.298
Oh, my God, that is crazy.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.884
- It's not like I'm attracted to Jeffrey.
- So what?

20:20.052 --> 20:24.931
Being funny is Chandler's thing.
You know, like Ross' thing is...

20:29.645 --> 20:31.729
Science?

20:31.980 --> 20:37.235
- Academia? Being a good father?
- No.

20:39.613 --> 20:43.324
- I can't believe he's that upset about this.
- You have to do some damage control.

20:43.492 --> 20:44.825
Because he's feeling like...

20:45.285 --> 20:47.745
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey.

20:47.913 --> 20:50.831
- What are you guys talking about?
- Uh, ahem.

20:50.999 --> 20:54.627
Rachel and I, uh, hired a male nanny.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.505
You got a man who's a nanny?

20:58.382 --> 20:59.674
You got a "manny"?

21:09.351 --> 21:11.352
You know, I don't mind a male nanny...

21:11.520 --> 21:13.354
...but I do draw the line
at male wet nurse.

21:17.359 --> 21:21.195
Oh! Oh! You are on a roll, mister.

21:22.030 --> 21:24.991
If I'd known you guys were coming over,
I would've brought more pizza.

21:27.327 --> 21:31.455
Okay. Okay. Stop it, you.
You stop it.

21:33.083 --> 21:35.668
What is so funny about that?

21:36.420 --> 21:39.755
I don't know, it's...
Well, just the way you say it.

21:39.923 --> 21:43.884
I mean, you're funny. You have
that funny thing. You're a funny guy.

21:47.097 --> 21:48.597
Did you tell her what we talked about?

21:54.229 --> 21:55.896
Yeah.

21:59.151 --> 22:02.945
So those were pity laughs?
Pity laughs?

22:03.655 --> 22:05.990
Honey, listen.

22:06.366 --> 22:08.409
You have nothing to worry about
with Jeffrey.

22:08.577 --> 22:10.703
Oh, yeah? Is he funnier than me?

22:11.079 --> 22:13.581
Well, you're different funny.

22:13.749 --> 22:16.083
I mean, you're more sarcastic.

22:16.251 --> 22:19.962
And, well, he does bits and impressions
and limericks.

22:20.130 --> 22:21.255
I do limericks.

22:21.506 --> 22:26.927
Uh, there once was a man named Chandler
whose wife made him die inside.

22:28.388 --> 22:31.098
Honey, you know I think you're hilarious.

22:31.266 --> 22:33.184
You know that joke
you told me last week?

22:33.352 --> 22:36.228
The one about Jerry Lewis
and the girl with the lazy eye?

22:36.396 --> 22:37.980
That slayed me.

22:38.440 --> 22:42.568
Hey. I made up that joke
and told it to you.

22:46.281 --> 22:48.366
- Not knowing when to shut up.
- Yep, that's my thing.

22:48.533 --> 22:50.159
Yup.

22:57.167 --> 23:00.461
So how many guys have your key?

23:00.796 --> 23:03.506
No, no, no. It's not as bad as it looks.

23:03.757 --> 23:05.758
I was saying goodbye to an old friend.

23:06.134 --> 23:08.219
Your lipstick's on his mouth.

23:08.387 --> 23:12.014
Oh, uh, we just, uh,
happen to wear the same shade.

23:13.350 --> 23:16.477
No, um, David and I did used to go out.

23:16.770 --> 23:21.774
But years ago. And he lives in Minsk.
He's only in town for a couple days.

23:22.484 --> 23:24.151
- Did you, uh...?
- No. No.

23:24.319 --> 23:25.986
- Kiss him?
- Oh, well, yeah.

23:27.614 --> 23:30.741
Yes, but you should know,
she really likes you.

23:30.909 --> 23:34.370
In fact, I don't think you realize
just how lucky you are, fella.

23:34.579 --> 23:36.914
- Don't point your finger at me.
- Why?

23:37.082 --> 23:38.666
What are you gonna do about it?

23:38.917 --> 23:41.752
Well, I'll show you
what I'm gonna do about it.

23:41.920 --> 23:45.464
- Oh, really? Really?
- You want some of that? Huh? Huh?

23:48.301 --> 23:51.429
Stop it. Stop it.
Before someone gets really hurt.

23:54.141 --> 23:56.600
Here, David, you should just go.

23:56.768 --> 23:58.060
All right.

23:59.312 --> 24:04.024
But if I ever do come back from Minsk,
well, you just better watch out.

24:04.276 --> 24:07.445
- If I go to Minsk, you better watch out.
- Oh, you're going to Minsk?

24:07.654 --> 24:10.489
- Well, I might.
- Really?

24:10.657 --> 24:13.993
Well, if you do, come in the spring.
It's just lovely there.

24:14.369 --> 24:17.663
- Okay, well, guys?
- Well...

24:18.123 --> 24:19.748
- Goodbye, Phoebe.
- Bye.

24:19.958 --> 24:23.502
- Hey, what, are you kidding me?
- Right-o. Right-o.

24:27.215 --> 24:29.133
Take good care of her.

24:31.970 --> 24:34.138
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

24:34.306 --> 24:37.641
If you want your key back,
I totally understand.

24:39.352 --> 24:42.313
- It's never gonna happen again, right?
- Right. Never. I swear.

24:44.191 --> 24:50.196
I... Oh, I just want to say, if you do ever
come to Minsk, that's my number.

24:50.363 --> 24:53.824
We'll, uh, party up Vladnik-style.

25:09.758 --> 25:11.342
Yeah. All right.

25:11.635 --> 25:15.930
Hey, Ross. Check it out.
Sandy taught me "Hot Cross Buns."

25:16.515 --> 25:19.058
Really? Sounded like "Three Blind Mice."

25:19.351 --> 25:22.186
- No, "Three Blind Mice" goes like this.
- I swear to God.

25:25.941 --> 25:29.318
- Who's up for puppets?
- Me. I'm up for puppets.

25:29.486 --> 25:32.613
Well, please welcome:

25:32.781 --> 25:34.740
The Snufflebumps.

25:34.908 --> 25:38.577
Who wants to be Mr. Wigglemunch
and who's gonna be the Grumpus?

25:38.745 --> 25:43.958
Okay, okay, how exactly is a 2-month-old
supposed to appreciate puppets?

25:44.209 --> 25:48.462
Studies show that the movement and
colors help their cerebral development.

25:48.630 --> 25:52.174
The whimsical characters are just for us.

25:56.263 --> 25:59.139
I want to be Mr. Wigglemunch.

26:00.308 --> 26:01.559
Oh, my God.

26:01.726 --> 26:04.520
Well, I guess we know
who's gonna be the Grumpus.

26:10.068 --> 26:12.653
- That was kind of rude.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

26:12.821 --> 26:16.865
Please apologize to Sandy
and the Snufflebumps for me.

26:17.158 --> 26:20.369
- You know, he was just doing his job.
- You know what?

26:20.537 --> 26:26.750
I'm sorry I'm the only one who isn't
in love with Gary Poppins out there.

26:29.212 --> 26:31.797
But I just... I can't go through with this.

26:32.090 --> 26:33.632
- Come on.
- No. You know what?

26:33.883 --> 26:38.846
I would never force you to hire someone
you were this uncomfortable with.

26:41.558 --> 26:44.393
Ugh, that's true.

26:44.561 --> 26:45.728
Thank you.

26:45.979 --> 26:48.314
You want to fire him,
so you're gonna have to go do it.

26:51.610 --> 26:57.573
So you see, Wigglemunch,
that's why it's important to share.

26:59.326 --> 27:02.620
I am learning so much from you.

27:07.542 --> 27:08.792
Well, I'm off to Tulsa.

27:09.085 --> 27:12.421
So if your maître d' friend
has any funny Oklahoma jokes...

27:12.589 --> 27:17.343
...tell him to e-mail me at
www-dot-ha-ha-not-so-much-dot-com.

27:19.554 --> 27:21.138
Honey, you can relax.

27:21.348 --> 27:24.725
Last night at work
Jeffrey told this really sexist joke.

27:24.893 --> 27:27.811
- After that, not so funny anymore.
- Really?

27:28.063 --> 27:31.815
See, that's the thing.
You gotta keep it smart, people.

27:31.983 --> 27:35.319
Okay. Don't miss that flight.
You know I love you.

27:35.570 --> 27:37.321
I love you too.

27:38.073 --> 27:41.825
- And I like you as a friend.
- Right.

27:41.993 --> 27:44.536
- See you later.
- See you.

27:46.039 --> 27:49.625
- Did the guy really make that joke?
- No, he still kills me.

27:49.793 --> 27:54.088
Last night he had me laughing so hard,
I swear, a little pee came out.

28:02.430 --> 28:03.597
Here goes.

28:03.807 --> 28:07.101
I can't watch. It's like firing Elmo.

28:11.731 --> 28:13.148
Sandy? Hi.

28:13.316 --> 28:15.067
- Hi.
- We, uh...

28:15.235 --> 28:17.277
We kind of need to talk.

28:21.282 --> 28:23.575
I'm afraid it's not working out.

28:26.496 --> 28:28.247
- Oh.
- Yeah, um...

28:28.456 --> 28:33.752
I mean, Rachel and I think
you are great with Emma. Um...

28:33.920 --> 28:37.172
- We just feel...
- You. You feel.

28:38.049 --> 28:40.718
I just feel...

28:42.721 --> 28:46.098
...that the chemistry isn't right.
I'm sorry.

28:46.266 --> 28:48.934
We're more than happy to give you
a good recommendation.

28:49.185 --> 28:53.522
No, that's okay. I had a lot of offers
from other families.

28:53.690 --> 28:55.983
I just picked you guys because...

28:56.151 --> 29:00.237
- ...I liked you the best.
- Oh, damn you, Geller.

29:03.491 --> 29:06.493
Anyway, uh, well, I'm glad
there's no hard feelings.

29:06.745 --> 29:11.540
No, none at all. You need to be happy
with whoever is in your home.

29:11.750 --> 29:15.294
Although, if you don't mind telling me...

29:15.462 --> 29:18.922
...what was the problem? Maybe it's
something I can work on in the future.

29:19.132 --> 29:25.262
No, you know, it's, uh, nothing you did.
It's... It's, uh, my issue.

29:26.389 --> 29:27.973
What is it?

29:28.767 --> 29:30.267
Uh, heh...

29:30.435 --> 29:32.060
Please?

29:35.648 --> 29:38.358
You know, I'm just not, um,
that comfortable...

29:38.526 --> 29:42.112
...with a guy who's as sensitive as you.

29:43.156 --> 29:44.198
That's fair.

29:45.241 --> 29:48.869
Although, can I ask,
why do you think that is?

29:49.496 --> 29:51.330
Why? I don't know.

29:56.169 --> 29:58.587
Um... Uh...

29:59.047 --> 30:01.590
Maybe because of my father?

30:01.758 --> 30:03.217
Mm.

30:04.511 --> 30:08.430
I mean, uh, you know, when I was
growing up, he was a tough guy.

30:09.891 --> 30:13.477
You know, and as a kid,
I wasn't the athlete I am now.

30:15.855 --> 30:18.649
I play squash.

30:22.237 --> 30:27.825
Anyway, I, uh... I always got the feeling
he thought I was too sensitive.

30:28.326 --> 30:29.660
That must have been hard.

30:31.204 --> 30:33.247
It was hard.

30:34.499 --> 30:39.711
I remember I was in my bedroom,
playing with my dinosaurs...

30:40.797 --> 30:42.130
Playing and learning.

30:44.801 --> 30:50.639
And my father walks in and says,
"What are you doing with those things?

30:50.849 --> 30:56.770
What's wrong with you? Why aren't you
outside playing like a real boy?"

30:57.063 --> 31:00.357
- But you are a real boy.
- I know I am.

31:02.652 --> 31:07.781
And when it's summer and it's hot,
why can't you wear a tank top?

31:09.158 --> 31:15.372
It's all right. Crying is good.
It lets the boo-hoos out.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.876
Here comes some more.

31:27.427 --> 31:30.679
And what's the one kind of boat
that can never ever sink?

31:30.972 --> 31:35.851
- What kind?
- A friend ship.

31:37.729 --> 31:41.064
Wow. You blow my mind.

31:43.026 --> 31:45.068
- Oh, I gotta go.
- Aw.

31:45.236 --> 31:47.029
- How much do I owe you?
- Twenty bucks.

31:47.655 --> 31:50.699
It's like the cheapest college ever.
