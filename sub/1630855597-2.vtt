WEBVTT

00:01.584 --> 00:03.128
<i>Previously on</i> Billions.

00:03.128 --> 00:05.005
We're gonna destroy
Mike Prince together.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.673
You're gonna clear me.

00:06.673 --> 00:07.882
The world will think

00:07.882 --> 00:09.092
you're under indictment

00:09.092 --> 00:11.386
and going away,
right up until the minute

00:11.386 --> 00:13.972
we lock Mike Prince up.

00:13.972 --> 00:15.181
You got a deal.

00:15.181 --> 00:16.558
But no one can know.

00:16.558 --> 00:18.143
The GPS ankle monitor, Judge,

00:18.143 --> 00:20.353
is an unnecessary
and extraordinary measure.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.897
- Request denied.
- You knew the deal.

00:22.897 --> 00:26.067
- This man is a crusader.
- This piece basically says

00:26.067 --> 00:27.652
you're the Robin Hood
of New York City.

00:27.652 --> 00:29.279
- I am.
- We were supposed to be

00:29.279 --> 00:30.447
in this together.

00:30.447 --> 00:31.990
You made me ashamed
to be seen in public,

00:31.990 --> 00:33.950
divided my family,
and you shut me out.

00:33.950 --> 00:35.660
You're making your
only friend into your enemy.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.454
Taylor Mason Carbon
will be sunsetted,

00:37.454 --> 00:40.665
but you will still be right here
at the head of one unified firm.

00:40.665 --> 00:42.292
We can't embarrass each other.

00:42.292 --> 00:43.877
We need to slake our appetites.

00:43.877 --> 00:46.421
Michael fucking Prince
is running for president.

00:46.421 --> 00:49.132
But I have decided
that he is dangerous.

00:49.132 --> 00:50.550
I came over here for your help.

00:50.550 --> 00:52.802
If that's why you've come,
you're not alone.

00:52.802 --> 00:55.472
All that's missing is Han
and the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

00:55.472 --> 00:58.224
I guess that's where I come in.

01:17.702 --> 01:20.955
<i>Do you wanna dance
And hold my hand?</i>

01:20.955 --> 01:23.541
<i>Tell me, baby,
I'm your lover man</i>

01:23.541 --> 01:25.126
<i>Oh, baby</i>

01:25.126 --> 01:28.046
<i>Do you wanna dance?</i>

01:28.046 --> 01:31.341
<i>Do you wanna dance
Under the moonlight?</i>

01:31.341 --> 01:34.427
<i>Squeeze me, baby,
All through the night</i>

01:34.427 --> 01:35.970
<i>Oh, baby</i>

01:35.970 --> 01:39.015
<i>Do you wanna dance?</i>

01:39.015 --> 01:41.851
<i>Do you, do you, do you
Do you wanna dance?</i>

01:41.851 --> 01:44.979
<i>Do you, do you
Do you, do you wanna dance?</i>

01:44.979 --> 01:46.356
<i>Do you, do you, do you</i>

01:46.356 --> 01:50.235
<i>Do you wanna dance?</i>

01:54.489 --> 01:57.992
<i>Do you wanna dance
Under the moonlight?</i>

01:57.992 --> 02:00.328
<i>Squeeze me, baby,
All through the night</i>

02:00.328 --> 02:02.580
<i>Oh, baby</i>

02:02.580 --> 02:05.250
<i>Do you wanna dance?</i>

02:05.250 --> 02:08.545
<i>Do you wanna dance
Under the moonlight?</i>

02:08.545 --> 02:10.922
<i>Squeeze me, baby,
All through the night</i>

02:10.922 --> 02:13.007
<i>Oh, baby</i>

02:13.007 --> 02:16.803
<i>Do you wanna dance?</i>

02:19.931 --> 02:22.642
Axe Global's lean and mean
as James Coburn's silhouette

02:22.642 --> 02:24.519
- in the <i>Mag Seven</i> days.
- Listen,

02:24.519 --> 02:26.980
only a moron wouldn't
be "hodling" in this market.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.065
This is not the time
for paper hands.

02:29.065 --> 02:30.483
No, if that's how you feel,

02:30.483 --> 02:31.943
then you should be off
saving trees or children.

02:31.943 --> 02:33.444
Whatever the fuck.
I'm making money.

02:33.444 --> 02:36.030
Plus I got Gordie
trading in digital currency.

02:36.030 --> 02:37.740
Kid's a killer
with the blockchain.

02:37.740 --> 02:39.951
Ah, "Crusher" Blackwell
of the crypto.

02:39.951 --> 02:41.161
Get 'em, Gordo!

02:41.161 --> 02:43.121
Give 'em the big splash
like Crusher used to.

02:43.121 --> 02:45.582
I am banging 'em two at a time,
Uncle Wags.

02:45.582 --> 02:47.125
The two billion
you started with...

02:47.125 --> 02:49.502
- Doubled, more or less.
- Yeah, of course he has.

02:49.502 --> 02:51.129
Rags to riches,
twice over.

02:51.129 --> 02:53.131
From stowaway on a plane
to king of the castle,

02:53.131 --> 02:55.508
- emperor of the realm.
- We got it, Wagsy.

02:55.508 --> 02:57.051
You seem different.

02:57.051 --> 02:59.888
Lighter. Focused. Happy.

02:59.888 --> 03:03.224
Yes, like Bruce Wayne
after training at the monastery.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.351
Steve Jobs
after meditating in India.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.228
- Deadlier than ever.
- Okay.

03:07.228 --> 03:08.646
You guys are laying this on thicker

03:08.646 --> 03:10.023
than a Carol Kaye bassline.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.734
But instead, tell me this.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.653
Prince send you here
to get me leaning forward

03:15.653 --> 03:17.906
so he can knock me down again?

03:21.242 --> 03:24.787
I can see h-how you'd--
but no.

03:24.787 --> 03:26.873
If he even knew we were here,
we'd be whacked.

03:26.873 --> 03:30.877
We kind of planted the idea
for this trip in a way that...

03:30.877 --> 03:32.212
Made him think it was his?

03:32.212 --> 03:34.255
I've been on the smoking end
of that.

03:34.255 --> 03:35.381
No fun.

03:35.381 --> 03:36.966
Our ostensible purpose here
is to flake off

03:36.966 --> 03:38.635
certain controversial
foreign investors

03:38.635 --> 03:39.928
in anticipation of Prince's run.

03:39.928 --> 03:41.304
Huh. Prince for Prez.

03:41.304 --> 03:44.265
It doesn't get easier to swallow
the more you say it.

03:44.265 --> 03:45.767
And the future leader
of the free world

03:45.767 --> 03:48.895
has no clue that he flew
the three of you out here

03:48.895 --> 03:50.063
so that you could...

03:50.063 --> 03:51.689
Enlist you in a campaign
against him?

03:51.689 --> 03:54.108
Against his campaign.

03:58.071 --> 04:01.032
It's tough to be a billionaire
these days.

04:01.699 --> 04:03.701
All right.

04:05.286 --> 04:07.580
Let's get to it. Come on.

04:11.876 --> 04:13.336
The State of New York is moving

04:13.336 --> 04:16.256
to dismiss the indictment
with prejudice, yes?

04:16.256 --> 04:20.134
Yes, we're moving to dismiss
all charges against Mr. Rhoades.

04:21.177 --> 04:22.679
And the reason for dismissal,

04:22.679 --> 04:24.055
Madam Attorney General?

04:24.055 --> 04:25.473
I'll take the first part first.

04:25.473 --> 04:27.558
- No evidence--
- Mr. Rhoades,

04:27.558 --> 04:30.270
- the judge asked--
- No crime. No nothing.

04:31.187 --> 04:32.563
Plus, no jury would convict,

04:32.563 --> 04:35.733
since the general cultural
reappraisal of my prior work

04:35.733 --> 04:38.778
has lifted my reputation
to heights so high

04:38.778 --> 04:41.489
not even Dick Fosbury
could flop over it.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.908
The State of New York
no longer feels

04:43.908 --> 04:45.702
it can prove Mr. Rhoades's guilt

04:45.702 --> 04:47.954
beyond a reasonable doubt,
Your Honor.

04:49.998 --> 04:54.335
Despite the defendant's
Ochocinco touchdown dance,

04:54.335 --> 04:56.796
the motion is granted
with prejudice.

04:56.796 --> 04:59.632
Mr. Rhoades,
charges are dismissed.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.551
You are free to go.

05:03.594 --> 05:05.346
Attorney General Mahar...

05:06.431 --> 05:09.225
I advise you to exercise
better judgment

05:09.225 --> 05:10.810
in future prosecutions,

05:10.810 --> 05:15.773
especially given the waste
of judicial resources.

05:17.066 --> 05:18.776
Understood, Your Honor.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.282
Hot damn.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.253
Describe it to me.

05:37.920 --> 05:41.591
The moment you enter the Oval
and sit behind the desk.

05:41.591 --> 05:43.217
The way you see it
when you daydream.

05:43.217 --> 05:45.303
I've never once
conjured that image.

05:45.303 --> 05:46.637
I'm not the sort of man--

05:46.637 --> 05:50.058
First campaign I was on,
my boss, the Ragin' Cajun,

05:50.058 --> 05:51.309
laid it out for me.

05:51.309 --> 05:53.144
You gotta make these guys
tell you the dream.

05:53.144 --> 05:55.730
It's the only way
to get inside their heads.

05:55.730 --> 05:57.315
His guy was a megalomaniac.

05:57.315 --> 05:58.816
I won't work for one
who isn't,

05:58.816 --> 06:00.443
'cause that sucker's
never getting there.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.737
And every single one of you
rolls that first moment

06:02.737 --> 06:04.989
around your brains
like Marshall Mathers imagined

06:04.989 --> 06:07.283
the first time he'd have
an audience with Dre.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.286
Now you've presented
this challenge well.

06:10.286 --> 06:11.621
I can't tell if I score
more points

06:11.621 --> 06:12.955
with you as a politician--

06:12.955 --> 06:14.916
We never use that word.
You're not a politician.

06:14.916 --> 06:17.668
You're hoping to contribute
by doing a public service.

06:17.668 --> 06:19.837
- A statesman.
- Good. Yes.

06:19.837 --> 06:22.423
Still, I can't tell
if I score more points

06:22.423 --> 06:24.300
by giving in quickly
to your frame

06:24.300 --> 06:26.302
or by continuing to resist it.

06:26.302 --> 06:28.012
Nicely rendered, as I said.

06:28.012 --> 06:29.180
Don't vamp.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.557
You won't have time to
when the cameras are on.

06:36.187 --> 06:39.357
I walk into the Oval alone.

06:40.149 --> 06:41.442
Slowly.

06:41.442 --> 06:45.905
Hesitate before coming around
and sitting in the chair.

06:47.490 --> 06:50.076
I take the letter
the previous fella wrote,

06:50.076 --> 06:53.413
put it in my jacket pocket
to read later.

06:55.373 --> 06:58.000
I let myself
take three deep breaths

06:58.000 --> 07:01.921
of total and complete satisfaction.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.424
And then I call Scooter in,

07:04.424 --> 07:06.008
and we start doing
the nation's business.

07:06.008 --> 07:07.593
If you were
a normal candidate,

07:07.593 --> 07:09.554
the only win would have been
to refuse the premise,

07:09.554 --> 07:11.139
start talking
about something else.

07:11.139 --> 07:14.559
But since I'm not,
I lean into the authenticity,

07:14.559 --> 07:15.935
the man of purpose
who isn't afraid

07:15.935 --> 07:17.228
to seem like
he wants it all.

07:17.228 --> 07:19.063
Yeah. Bring him along with you

07:19.063 --> 07:21.023
so they think
it can happen to them too.

07:21.023 --> 07:24.152
The money, the power, the job.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.195
So they keep two thoughts
about you in their heads

07:26.195 --> 07:28.531
at the same time.
You're just like them.

07:28.531 --> 07:31.826
Small town. Grit and effort,
and luck smiling upon.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.995
But also that you are nothing
like them at all,

07:33.995 --> 07:36.497
that you are their better
who will protect them

07:36.497 --> 07:40.835
and lead them while at least
understanding them.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.296
You get it.

07:44.130 --> 07:46.174
That's why you're the best

07:46.174 --> 07:48.176
in your game.

07:49.510 --> 07:51.762
So, you in?
You gonna run the campaign?

07:51.762 --> 07:55.725
Because you parried
one attack? Uh, no.

07:55.725 --> 07:57.393
I'm a bit of a way from in.

07:57.393 --> 08:00.480
But I'm not out.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.024
Not sure you believe yet
in me, or...?

08:03.024 --> 08:04.484
I'm not sure I see the path.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.611
When I do something,
it usually works.

08:06.611 --> 08:08.821
And if it doesn't,
I pivot in such a way

08:08.821 --> 08:10.031
that no one remembers--

08:10.031 --> 08:11.532
"Usually" isn't
gonna be good enough.

08:11.532 --> 08:12.992
You're running
as an independent,

08:12.992 --> 08:14.869
which is gonna burn me
with the DNC if we lose

08:14.869 --> 08:18.247
and with the GOP if I ever
decide to change stripes.

08:18.247 --> 08:19.582
Can't be a bad thing these days.

08:19.582 --> 08:20.833
As the Cajun taught me,

08:20.833 --> 08:22.627
Dems are about as fun
as a church dance,

08:22.627 --> 08:23.961
and even less sexy.

08:23.961 --> 08:25.796
- But their checks clear.
- Yeah, well, with me,

08:25.796 --> 08:27.924
you can forget about checks.
I pay cash.

08:27.924 --> 08:29.133
And when we win,

08:29.133 --> 08:31.469
you'll be feted
as a miracle worker.

08:31.469 --> 08:33.346
That part is true.

08:34.764 --> 08:37.308
And now I know
how you get there.

08:37.308 --> 08:39.393
The Eisenhower path.

08:40.269 --> 08:41.938
That's pretty much it.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.439
I have to win a world war?

08:43.439 --> 08:45.566
Oh, ha! If only.

08:45.566 --> 08:47.985
No, you have to be excellent
in your chosen field.

08:47.985 --> 08:50.279
Best in the world.

08:50.279 --> 08:51.447
He already is.

08:51.447 --> 08:54.283
Even better than he's been.

08:54.283 --> 08:55.826
So good at it
that it becomes obvious

08:55.826 --> 08:58.079
why he should take
that skill set to the Oval.

08:58.079 --> 08:59.705
So he needs record returns.

08:59.705 --> 09:02.500
But within
impossible parameters.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.877
Every investment your firm makes
is gonna be scrutinized

09:04.877 --> 09:07.630
for both profitability
and ethical soundness.

09:07.630 --> 09:10.299
Sounds like a typical day
here at MPC.

09:10.299 --> 09:11.759
Don't sell it.

09:11.759 --> 09:13.344
Do it.

09:13.344 --> 09:15.429
Show me, everyone,

09:15.429 --> 09:17.265
that you can create
unseen returns

09:17.265 --> 09:18.849
without coming close
to the line,

09:18.849 --> 09:21.978
while at the same time slowly
turning to face the public,

09:21.978 --> 09:26.232
and, uh, yeah, I'm a real
possibility for you.

09:29.193 --> 09:30.736
I'll do it.

09:31.445 --> 09:33.072
I was born to do it.

09:33.656 --> 09:34.824
And, uh, you have to know,

09:34.824 --> 09:36.409
even if I decide
to engage,

09:36.409 --> 09:38.452
I'll have to deep dive
in the rest of your life.

09:38.452 --> 09:39.662
Starting with your wife.

09:39.662 --> 09:43.291
I have to meet her
before I sign on.

09:43.291 --> 09:44.917
Of course.

09:50.256 --> 09:51.549
You're conflicted.

09:51.549 --> 09:53.926
I don't audition.
He should be auditioning.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.469
He was. He did.

09:55.469 --> 09:57.388
And he got the part.

09:57.388 --> 09:59.265
That he's picky,
that's good.

09:59.265 --> 10:01.684
Yes. Yeah. Agreed.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.019
I'll give him what he wants,

10:03.019 --> 10:04.770
a ten-bagger that hits
my constituents

10:04.770 --> 10:06.147
in their wallets
and their hearts

10:06.147 --> 10:08.024
while filling mine too.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.358
Tell Philip to put the word out

10:09.358 --> 10:11.277
and start vetting ideas
that come in.

10:11.277 --> 10:12.361
And Andy?

10:12.361 --> 10:13.946
You two need to have
that conversation.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.239
I'm not letting some guy

10:15.239 --> 10:17.116
that doesn't even work
for me yet inside my bedroom.

10:17.116 --> 10:20.411
Running for president involves
enduring humiliations aplenty.

10:20.411 --> 10:21.704
It comes with the job.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.831
Like Bernie Sanders
dancing on <i>Ellen,</i>

10:23.831 --> 10:26.626
or Hillary cozying up to Bill
on <i>60 Minutes.</i>

10:26.626 --> 10:28.336
Call Andy.

10:42.725 --> 10:44.435
Daevisha.

10:44.435 --> 10:46.020
Hmm.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.981
Shall I greet you
in the Philly shell

10:48.981 --> 10:50.650
to deflect
the roundhouse right?

10:50.650 --> 10:52.860
I'd feint with my right
and land an uppercut

10:52.860 --> 10:54.362
before you got off.

10:54.362 --> 10:56.072
So instead, we talk?

10:56.072 --> 10:59.033
That seems to be
our theater of combat, yes.

10:59.033 --> 11:02.244
And I came to say this: If you
think you're coming for my job

11:02.244 --> 11:05.873
now that you're free,
know that I will not step down

11:05.873 --> 11:07.750
and I will not relent.

11:07.750 --> 11:09.710
Mm. Yeah, no, of course. Sure.

11:09.710 --> 11:12.380
You're Sugar Ray, hellbent
on cracking that shell.

11:12.380 --> 11:14.131
I will move silent and deadly

11:14.131 --> 11:15.800
and unpredictable
as a fucking panther.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.594
If I were to come
for your post,

11:18.594 --> 11:21.305
I'd whisper about how cozy
you are with big business...

11:21.305 --> 11:25.393
Oh, you bring that weak shit
my way, and I will crush you.

11:25.393 --> 11:27.019
Ah. Breathe, Davey.

11:27.019 --> 11:29.730
The thing is,
I see your gig for what it is.

11:29.730 --> 11:32.692
- Bush league.
- Suited you fine not long ago.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.485
Oh, I took it
'cause it was there.

11:34.485 --> 11:35.986
A way station.

11:35.986 --> 11:37.613
But it's not the job
I'm looking at now.

11:37.613 --> 11:40.825
Perfect for you, though.
Bush league.

11:42.076 --> 11:44.912
But you do have your eye
on something.

11:45.579 --> 11:47.415
If a fella doesn't
have his eye on something,

11:47.415 --> 11:49.834
how's he gonna know
where he's going?

11:59.260 --> 12:00.678
Remember the assignment.

12:00.678 --> 12:01.804
Big and brassy,

12:01.804 --> 12:03.222
like something Gaga
would've worn

12:03.222 --> 12:04.515
before she became
a movie star.

12:04.515 --> 12:07.101
Got one. Zilo Pharma
has reversed aging

12:07.101 --> 12:08.394
in naked mole rats.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.646
Well-Global, manufacturing
using carbon dioxide

12:10.646 --> 12:12.648
- pulled from the atmosphere.
- K-Cel,

12:12.648 --> 12:14.984
quantum battery charging
for electric cars.

12:25.578 --> 12:26.829
Selling candy so the debate team

12:26.829 --> 12:28.372
can take a charter bus
to nationals?

12:28.372 --> 12:29.623
I was in band.

12:29.623 --> 12:31.625
Our bus trip was to
the Medieval Times in Lyndhurst.

12:31.625 --> 12:35.713
- Horn section.
- Woodwinds. Bassoon.

12:35.713 --> 12:38.174
This is it. Your play.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.259
- Philip agreed?
- We'll never know.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.178
I drove around
that particular speed bump.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.554
Because he'd spot the trouble?

12:43.554 --> 12:44.972
'Cause I didn't want
to share the credit.

12:44.972 --> 12:47.391
Just like a bassoonist.

12:47.391 --> 12:49.143
Skipped a step.

12:49.143 --> 12:51.270
It's okay. Pitch it.

12:51.270 --> 12:56.317
Company's called Korlera.
This is the product.

12:56.317 --> 12:58.986
All the devices
are Bluetooth-enabled.

12:59.904 --> 13:01.197
Doctors connect with patients

13:01.197 --> 13:03.199
in poor and rural areas
over video.

13:03.199 --> 13:05.117
Readings come in in real time.

13:05.117 --> 13:07.995
- Let's see it in action.
- Of course.

13:08.954 --> 13:09.914
Unmuting.

13:09.914 --> 13:13.542
Dr. Eisenstadt,
I'm with Mike Prince now.

13:13.542 --> 13:15.211
- Run us through.
- <i>Great.</i>

13:15.211 --> 13:16.754
<i>Let's start with
the blood pressure cuff.</i>

13:16.754 --> 13:18.589
<i>Place it on your wrist,
Mr. Prince,</i>

13:18.589 --> 13:20.424
<i>then put your feet
flat on the ground.</i>

13:20.424 --> 13:21.717
<i>That looks good.</i>

13:21.717 --> 13:24.595
<i>Go ahead and press start
on the monitor.</i>

13:27.973 --> 13:30.476
<i>Beautiful.</i>

13:30.476 --> 13:32.311
<i>I'm getting a clear reading.</i>

13:32.311 --> 13:33.437
<i>110 over 77.</i>

13:33.437 --> 13:34.772
<i>That's excellent, Mr. Prince.</i>

13:34.772 --> 13:37.566
<i>We can do EKG,
blood glucose level,</i>

13:37.566 --> 13:38.818
<i>pulse oximeter, we can--</i>

13:38.818 --> 13:41.445
Thanks, Doc.
That's good enough for now.

13:41.445 --> 13:43.072
Killer numbers there, boss.

13:43.072 --> 13:45.366
How can they guarantee
HIPAA compliance?

13:45.366 --> 13:46.742
Encrypted transmission.

13:46.742 --> 13:48.452
BLE is notoriously vulnerable

13:48.452 --> 13:50.996
- to hacking and malfunction.
- Yeah, that's true.

13:50.996 --> 13:52.456
Bluetooth Low Energy was.

13:52.456 --> 13:55.042
But all Korlera's devices
run Bluetooth 5.2.

13:55.042 --> 13:56.377
They were designed for it.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.128
So they didn't have to retrofit
older hardware?

13:58.128 --> 14:01.465
Exactly. Poor areas
underserved by medical care

14:01.465 --> 14:04.093
suddenly have access
like everyone else.

14:04.093 --> 14:05.344
In fact, I sent one of these

14:05.344 --> 14:06.762
to my grandparents
outside of Buffalo.

14:06.762 --> 14:08.472
Said it was like having
Marcus Welby, MD,

14:08.472 --> 14:10.558
in their guest room,
whoever the fuck that is.

14:10.558 --> 14:12.309
Good. Very good.

14:12.309 --> 14:14.562
This market's
been accelerated by COVID.

14:14.562 --> 14:18.524
Projected to grow
to 4.3 trillion by 2026.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.442
So if you want one
that earns like Munger

14:20.442 --> 14:23.529
but plays like Oprah,
this is it.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.489
Philip?

14:25.489 --> 14:27.908
It's a Lady Gaga.

14:27.908 --> 14:30.536
Good work, Victor.
Super-size it.

14:34.915 --> 14:36.292
Bradford Luke called.

14:36.292 --> 14:39.003
He offered to connect you with
some other campaign managers

14:39.003 --> 14:40.254
to do the job.

14:40.254 --> 14:41.755
- Should I set the meetings?
- No.

14:41.755 --> 14:43.841
Tell him to hold off
on gifting me to someone else,

14:43.841 --> 14:45.509
for both of our sakes.
And, uh, one more thing.

14:45.509 --> 14:48.345
Tell him to keep an eye
on the medical space.

14:58.022 --> 15:00.524
I need you here ASAP.
Talk to the campaign guy.

15:00.524 --> 15:02.151
And so it begins.

15:02.151 --> 15:03.861
- I'll send the jet.
- Okay.

15:03.861 --> 15:07.531
There are a few things I have
to take care of here first.

15:07.531 --> 15:09.408
<i>A couple goodbyes.</i>

15:09.408 --> 15:10.618
Always with the dagger.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.828
Goes in clean,
comes out the same.

15:12.828 --> 15:14.914
Better than a bone saw.

15:15.873 --> 15:17.958
I'll see you soon.

15:23.255 --> 15:26.091
I had this thought that I was
going to ask you what you missed

15:26.091 --> 15:27.343
about your prior life.

15:27.343 --> 15:30.220
Hmm. Tactic designed
to get me nostalgic.

15:30.220 --> 15:33.015
To feel. Make me sympathetic
to your cause.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.017
It's a thought I had.
Not what I was thinking,

15:35.017 --> 15:36.268
because I dismissed the thought.

15:36.268 --> 15:39.104
Knowing I'd see the ruse
and think less of you?

15:39.104 --> 15:40.606
- Instead, I figured--
- Yeah.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.608
The sparring, the banter.
Same effect.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.443
Well, you got to admit,
it's as close to fun as--

15:44.443 --> 15:47.571
Yeah. This? This, I enjoy.

15:47.571 --> 15:50.282
Always have.
Moment we met.

15:50.282 --> 15:51.408
As do I.

15:51.408 --> 15:53.786
What I don't enjoy,
and you can't either,

15:53.786 --> 15:56.246
is what the motherfuck
has happened to Axe Capital.

15:56.246 --> 15:58.499
You spent years
building that firm.

15:58.499 --> 15:59.959
You turned pennies
into fortunes.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.877
You made killers
out of traders.

16:01.877 --> 16:03.128
You spun ruin into a reputation,

16:03.128 --> 16:05.297
and now it all belongs
to Michael Prince.

16:05.297 --> 16:08.592
Hmm. Now you're stoking
the anger.

16:08.592 --> 16:11.011
Yet another see-through tactic.

16:11.011 --> 16:13.138
But don't forget
the glorious part.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.682
The part where I got free.

16:14.682 --> 16:17.893
The cuffs were locked
around my wrists, yet I escaped.

16:17.893 --> 16:20.980
As the pride of Jacksonville
sang, "Free as a bird."

16:20.980 --> 16:24.400
And no matter what emotional
bullshit you sling,

16:24.400 --> 16:26.193
this bird you cannot change.

16:26.193 --> 16:27.528
You dodged it and slid it,

16:27.528 --> 16:29.655
and then it snapped
around your leg.

16:29.655 --> 16:31.699
The truth:
You cannot change.

16:31.699 --> 16:34.118
And you cannot really
be a person who is okay

16:34.118 --> 16:36.412
with letting someone else
steal your entire world.

16:36.412 --> 16:38.956
Even if he did leave you
a little sliver of land

16:38.956 --> 16:40.624
across the Atlantic.

16:42.334 --> 16:43.419
Solid.

16:43.419 --> 16:45.754
Good. Impressive.

16:45.754 --> 16:47.798
So, to you, now.

16:47.798 --> 16:49.425
Where's your number?

16:49.425 --> 16:51.051
- What?
- A hundred mil.

16:51.051 --> 16:53.178
You said you'd get out
at a hundred mil,

16:53.178 --> 16:54.513
so why aren't you out?

16:54.513 --> 16:56.849
I upped it. One billion.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.059
Okay. I can guess
where you're at.

16:59.059 --> 17:02.688
Need to turn it
a few more times to get there?

17:02.688 --> 17:05.065
If I'm you, that's all
I'm focusing on.

17:05.065 --> 17:06.400
I can still reach my goal.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.485
And I will,
after we take out Prince.

17:08.485 --> 17:12.489
Will hobbling Prince
clear your conscience?

17:14.199 --> 17:15.909
Make you free?

17:16.994 --> 17:18.871
Or will you manufacture
another obstacle

17:18.871 --> 17:21.373
and then wonder
why you're stuck behind it?

17:28.005 --> 17:30.132
How goes the redemption tour?

17:30.132 --> 17:31.300
<i>It's going.</i>

17:31.300 --> 17:32.801
<i>The Saudi Technology
Development Fund</i>

17:32.801 --> 17:34.428
<i>is ready to be redeemed
within 60 days.</i>

17:34.428 --> 17:37.598
They weren't happy about it,
but we got it done.

17:38.682 --> 17:40.684
<i>What is that,
a fire crackling?</i>

17:40.684 --> 17:42.352
Yeah. Lobby bar.

17:42.352 --> 17:44.063
It's homey.

17:44.813 --> 17:46.148
You've always been a good liar.

17:46.148 --> 17:47.775
Not always.

17:47.775 --> 17:49.985
That's something
I picked up from you.

17:49.985 --> 17:51.570
Oh, come on now.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.078
This one's on the house,
Mr. Rhoades.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.538
Oh, good man.
Thank you kindly.

18:05.918 --> 18:07.669
Hey.

18:07.669 --> 18:09.546
You're a matinee idol now.

18:09.546 --> 18:11.381
They wouldn't even know
what that means.

18:11.381 --> 18:13.050
Their dads would.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.094
- Maybe.
- Yeah.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.387
To your newfound popularity.

18:17.387 --> 18:18.806
And, of course,

18:18.806 --> 18:20.015
to your vindication.

18:20.015 --> 18:22.142
You shimmied out of that one

18:22.142 --> 18:23.393
like Lola Falana.

18:23.393 --> 18:26.647
I still feel that ankle bracelet
on me like a phantom limb.

18:26.647 --> 18:27.898
That's all it is now.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.733
You must be fielding
job offers by the dozen.

18:29.733 --> 18:32.111
What's got your eye?

18:32.111 --> 18:33.821
A federal judgeship?

18:33.821 --> 18:35.989
There's a clear path for you
to Assistant AG

18:35.989 --> 18:37.241
for the Criminal Division.

18:37.241 --> 18:39.326
Or, hell, why not
General Counsel

18:39.326 --> 18:41.787
of the Treasury Department?

18:41.787 --> 18:42.955
All federal positions.

18:42.955 --> 18:44.373
I could use you
on the inside.

18:44.373 --> 18:47.167
No, federal sounds about right.

18:47.167 --> 18:48.877
Just about.

18:48.877 --> 18:50.504
You see,
I have found myself

18:50.504 --> 18:54.550
feeling theologically
contemplative of late.

18:54.550 --> 18:59.346
I have been thinking about
the concept of original sin.

18:59.346 --> 19:00.389
Which aspect?

19:00.389 --> 19:02.015
I mean, I've always
taken the line

19:02.015 --> 19:04.143
that the temptation
wasn't the point.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.227
The point was--

19:05.227 --> 19:09.356
That one sin
begat a world of sinners.

19:10.691 --> 19:12.317
One minute, all was pure.

19:12.317 --> 19:15.654
The next,
a hellscape on earth.

19:15.654 --> 19:18.115
I feel like you're not
just talking about Eden.

19:18.115 --> 19:22.619
I'm talking about U.S. Attorney,
Southern District of New York.

19:23.662 --> 19:27.875
And how I was forced
from my chair unjustly,

19:27.875 --> 19:30.419
unfairly, sinfully.

19:30.419 --> 19:32.129
Ahh, Chuck, if I could.

19:32.129 --> 19:34.798
If anyone could.
There's no way.

19:34.798 --> 19:36.008
- Mm-hmm.
- No way.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.260
Uh-huh, but there is.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.470
You have a direct line
to the president.

19:40.470 --> 19:42.556
I've got more sway
than Kara Swisher,

19:42.556 --> 19:46.310
and even I can't get the
president to pardon that sin.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.854
I...I merely ask that you ask.

19:48.854 --> 19:52.024
Just point out that
I have been found innocent.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.358
It's not gonna happen.

19:53.358 --> 19:55.027
Not on this earthly plane.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.738
Try me again
at the Rapture.

20:09.791 --> 20:12.252
How do you have Leo McGarry-like
walk-in privileges

20:12.252 --> 20:13.795
before you've even
taken the job?

20:13.795 --> 20:16.340
Walk with a true sense of
purpose, no one ever stops you.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.883
This is what
it would be like

20:17.883 --> 20:20.594
if we were really doing it at
1600 Penn, the back and forth--

20:20.594 --> 20:22.763
When I see someone
about to step in some dog shit,

20:22.763 --> 20:24.765
I knock 'em
out of the way.

20:24.765 --> 20:25.766
Talk to me.

20:25.766 --> 20:27.309
The move you made
in the medical space

20:27.309 --> 20:28.644
isn't gonna go
the way you think.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.062
- Korlera?
- There's a lawsuit coming.

20:30.062 --> 20:31.480
Patient in Arkansas
suffered a stroke

20:31.480 --> 20:32.898
after the equipment malfunctioned.

20:32.898 --> 20:34.566
You got some Rolodex on you, kid.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.276
- Whoever tipped you off--
- A lawsuit like this

20:36.276 --> 20:38.445
is a death blow
for a young company like that.

20:38.445 --> 20:39.780
Well, the silver lining is

20:39.780 --> 20:41.698
you're invested enough
to show up here.

20:41.698 --> 20:44.451
Dog shit. Shoes.
That's all it is.

20:44.451 --> 20:46.578
Get out of your position
in that company.

20:46.578 --> 20:49.623
Is that what great leaders do?
Quit at the first reversal?

20:49.623 --> 20:51.541
Yeah, so they don't take
avoidable losses

20:51.541 --> 20:53.585
when the entire mission
is to seem like a winner.

20:53.585 --> 20:54.920
- To be a winner.
- So they find a way

20:54.920 --> 20:56.588
even when it seems impossible.

20:56.588 --> 20:58.298
The very best do, yeah.

20:58.298 --> 21:02.761
Or that malodorous stench
follows them wherever they go.

21:13.397 --> 21:14.815
You hiding this Korlera lawsuit
from me?

21:14.815 --> 21:17.567
I practice stealth
on your behalf, not against you.

21:17.567 --> 21:19.069
Right. Yeah. Okay.

21:19.069 --> 21:21.238
Well, there is a lawsuit,
and from the looks of it,

21:21.238 --> 21:22.864
it could screw our entire agenda

21:22.864 --> 21:25.200
on a micro, macro,
and global level.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.868
You want that I take care of it?

21:26.868 --> 21:29.413
<i>Medice, cura te ipsum.</i>

21:29.413 --> 21:31.415
And all of you,
keep cracking.

21:31.415 --> 21:33.750
More ideas. Better.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.253
Keep cracking!

21:37.379 --> 21:38.797
Hey, Ben Kim's sidekick.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.841
Got some positions
need taking in agriculture.

21:40.841 --> 21:43.343
I know you know my name, motherfucker.

21:43.343 --> 21:44.511
All right!

21:44.511 --> 21:47.472
Someone's been sprinkling
creatine on his Oatios.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.933
I'm gear-free, all natty.

21:49.933 --> 21:51.560
Except for a little Adderall.

21:51.560 --> 21:54.271
Mm-hmm. I need
an executing trader

21:54.271 --> 21:56.023
who doesn't ask questions.
Who you got?

21:56.023 --> 21:58.483
- For Prince's agenda?
- Eventually.

21:58.483 --> 22:02.070
This is a better approach.

22:02.070 --> 22:04.364
More certain.

22:04.364 --> 22:05.741
My guy at Spartan-Ives called

22:05.741 --> 22:07.242
to feel out the price
on a block trade.

22:07.242 --> 22:09.244
- Fertilizer company.
- Usually in that case

22:09.244 --> 22:12.205
there's a proviso that you don't
trade the name asked about.

22:12.205 --> 22:14.499
It's like if your best friend
says he'll feel out

22:14.499 --> 22:15.667
if a girl likes you,

22:15.667 --> 22:17.085
but instead he ends up

22:17.085 --> 22:18.545
just taking her to the prom,

22:18.545 --> 22:19.796
and then the two of them

22:19.796 --> 22:21.089
just giggling and dancing

22:21.089 --> 22:23.133
and even getting up with
the band to sing Death Cab songs

22:23.133 --> 22:26.428
that used to mean a lot
to you and your best friend.

22:26.428 --> 22:29.097
That's... vivid.

22:29.097 --> 22:30.849
We okay here?

22:30.849 --> 22:32.267
Yeah.

22:32.267 --> 22:34.311
It's just...
there's no doubt

22:34.311 --> 22:35.687
the broker got a promise
from you

22:35.687 --> 22:37.731
not to trade that company
for at least 24 hours

22:37.731 --> 22:39.107
in exchange for the info.

22:39.107 --> 22:40.484
And you're not telling Prince

22:40.484 --> 22:42.069
'cause it jeopardizes
our relationship--

22:42.069 --> 22:44.821
Relax! I'm not trading
that company.

22:44.821 --> 22:47.240
I'm trading around that company.

22:47.240 --> 22:49.076
That's why I need
an executing trader

22:49.076 --> 22:51.078
who can keep
operational silence.

22:51.078 --> 22:53.872
Well, it's sort of illegal,
isn't it?

22:54.664 --> 22:58.293
It may not be illegal... technically.

22:58.293 --> 22:59.544
It's gray.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.797
Like my fleece, yeah.

23:01.797 --> 23:04.549
It's my superhero uni.
I'm GrayMan.

23:04.549 --> 23:06.259
It's kind of one of those
"letter of the law

23:06.259 --> 23:08.011
versus spirit of the law"
situations.

23:08.011 --> 23:11.598
Letter is all that matters.
You should know that by now.

23:12.724 --> 23:16.603
I assume you're all admiring
my new look.

23:18.563 --> 23:20.399
Going for something
a little more rockin'.

23:20.399 --> 23:24.194
Like Billy Joel in 1980.
Next craze, new wave.

23:24.194 --> 23:25.487
Still rock and roll to you?

23:25.487 --> 23:27.406
Not the bard of Oyster Bay, no.

23:27.406 --> 23:30.742
I'm in my "Tunnel of Love"
phase.

23:32.494 --> 23:37.332
Bruce!

23:37.332 --> 23:39.751
Nobody wants compliance
breathing down their necks.

23:39.751 --> 23:42.921
Especially not a compliance guy
who thinks he's "The Boss."

23:42.921 --> 23:45.173
Do you need me to stick
my finger up your ass

23:45.173 --> 23:47.259
so you can actually nut up, Tuk?

23:47.259 --> 23:48.510
I knew you knew my name.

23:48.510 --> 23:51.513
I know a guy
who can make the trades.

23:51.513 --> 23:52.889
I can set a meet.

23:52.889 --> 23:54.474
Okay.

23:54.474 --> 23:56.893
Somewhere smoky.

24:02.023 --> 24:03.733
Physician, heal thyself.

24:03.733 --> 24:06.153
- You speak Latin?
- Of course.

24:06.153 --> 24:08.822
Does he mean I should hold
the position

24:08.822 --> 24:11.408
and eradicate the problem,
like a dose of antibiotics?

24:11.408 --> 24:13.326
Or does he mean I should
get out of the position,

24:13.326 --> 24:15.579
like amputating
the diseased limb?

24:15.579 --> 24:18.165
Yes. Yes, he does.

24:24.379 --> 24:26.298
A bevy of exotic spirits

24:26.298 --> 24:29.926
the likes of which I've only
ever seen in a dream.

24:29.926 --> 24:31.887
It's the Unicum from Budapest.

24:31.887 --> 24:33.388
Got a bottle of Becherovka

24:33.388 --> 24:35.098
from a deal clinched
in Karlovy Vary.

24:35.098 --> 24:38.560
That is a Brennivín.
Went to a facilitated meet

24:38.560 --> 24:41.605
with the Polish Chief of
the General Staff in Reykjavík.

24:41.605 --> 24:43.023
Maybe a little.

24:43.023 --> 24:44.858
Or we could try the...

24:44.858 --> 24:47.360
Then there is always...

24:47.360 --> 24:48.987
Or...

24:52.491 --> 24:54.659
- Louisville.
- Of course.

24:54.659 --> 24:58.371
Home tastes even better
when you're far from it.

25:00.248 --> 25:01.917
We only have a couple
of meetings left.

25:01.917 --> 25:04.252
All deals will be inked
in a day or two,

25:04.252 --> 25:06.755
and the European business
is done.

25:06.755 --> 25:08.548
We won't have cover
to stay any longer.

25:08.548 --> 25:10.050
That's the problem
with vacations.

25:10.050 --> 25:11.343
They always end too soon.

25:11.343 --> 25:13.929
Glad to hear you're not
calling it "holiday" yet.

25:13.929 --> 25:15.680
Cheers.

25:19.476 --> 25:20.685
Come back with us.

25:20.685 --> 25:22.771
Can't. Don't want to.

25:22.771 --> 25:24.731
But also, can't.

25:24.731 --> 25:26.858
For me to even step foot
in the U.S.,

25:26.858 --> 25:28.360
I'd need to be able
to move at will.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.487
I'd need guaranteed protection.
An escape route.

25:30.487 --> 25:32.989
I can't go into hiding again.
Not going to.

25:32.989 --> 25:37.285
My first couple months here,
before I figured it out, sucked.

25:37.285 --> 25:38.995
I wasn't able to move,
speak freely,

25:38.995 --> 25:40.121
buy how I wanted to.

25:40.121 --> 25:41.581
I'm not going back
to that place.

25:41.581 --> 25:42.749
All that can be arranged.

25:42.749 --> 25:44.376
You could arrange it
if you wanted to.

25:44.376 --> 25:47.337
Look what you did here in,
as you say, a matter of months.

25:47.337 --> 25:48.547
I like it here.

25:48.547 --> 25:51.800
- I do miss you, though.
- How could you not?

25:51.800 --> 25:53.301
Prince? I'll tell you, Axe,

25:53.301 --> 25:55.387
the guy thinks he's
Alanis Morissette or something.

25:55.387 --> 25:56.721
An actual force for good.

25:56.721 --> 25:58.223
Oh, no one who
thinks that ever is.

25:58.223 --> 26:00.267
The thing that really
scares me, Godfather,

26:00.267 --> 26:02.769
is how smart and powerful
he really is.

26:02.769 --> 26:06.606
And the very notion that
if he does it, it must be good.

26:06.606 --> 26:08.984
- Those elements combined...
- Started many a religion.

26:08.984 --> 26:10.443
None of them, in the end, good.

26:10.443 --> 26:11.778
Which is why we need you.

26:11.778 --> 26:13.405
Which is why you need
to drink up your whiskey.

26:13.405 --> 26:16.116
Come on, enough about Prince.
What about you?

26:16.116 --> 26:18.702
Where are you at with Chelz?

26:18.702 --> 26:19.911
Heard things are getting serious.

26:19.911 --> 26:22.080
- You kept tabs.
- You're my Wagsy.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.373
Of course I kept tabs.

26:23.373 --> 26:26.126
To keeping tabs
on those you love

26:26.126 --> 26:28.044
and finding a way to see each
other in person

26:28.044 --> 26:30.380
one last time
before the fall.

26:34.926 --> 26:37.679
Visitor on the tier.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.229
Sir.

26:52.110 --> 26:54.654
<i>I was just a normal guy</i>

26:54.654 --> 26:56.990
<i>Life was just a 9 to 5</i>

26:56.990 --> 26:58.992
<i>- With bills and pressure</i>
- All set, Sir.

26:58.992 --> 27:01.369
<i>- Piled up to the sky</i>
- Thank you.

27:01.369 --> 27:03.204
Howdy, partner.

27:03.204 --> 27:04.914
You look well.

27:07.751 --> 27:10.420
We have something in common,
you and I.

27:10.420 --> 27:12.464
We have been besmirched.

27:13.632 --> 27:16.801
Our names and reputations
have been stained.

27:17.969 --> 27:21.973
But my fall from grace,
started by your own hand,

27:21.973 --> 27:24.684
has given me pause.

27:25.935 --> 27:28.980
And it's gotten me thinking
in a language that you,

27:28.980 --> 27:31.441
a man of faith,
might understand.

27:31.441 --> 27:36.279
I have been reflecting on sin,
on justice,

27:36.279 --> 27:37.906
on redemption.

27:37.906 --> 27:39.866
And now that my name
has been cleared,

27:39.866 --> 27:44.037
I've found that freedom
tastes all the sweeter.

27:44.037 --> 27:48.375
It's deeper than it used to be,
wider, boundless.

27:51.169 --> 27:53.088
I am here to extend my hand,

27:53.088 --> 27:56.424
to pull you up from the morass
onto solid ground.

27:56.424 --> 27:59.386
I'm here to offer your release.

28:01.262 --> 28:03.181
And I have found a way

28:03.181 --> 28:06.351
that we can both
right the wrongs of the past

28:06.351 --> 28:09.646
and help each other
to a brighter future.

28:12.482 --> 28:15.902
If you will publicly admit that
when you were attorney general,

28:15.902 --> 28:19.322
you wrongfully recommended
to our former president

28:19.322 --> 28:22.784
that he fire me
from my position at SDNY,

28:22.784 --> 28:27.163
I give you my word that
as soon as I reclaim that post,

28:27.163 --> 28:29.666
I will get you released.

28:29.666 --> 28:33.503
I will make it
my first order of business.

28:34.754 --> 28:36.131
Hmm.

29:36.858 --> 29:38.902
Aw, shit.

29:39.819 --> 29:43.323
Fucking Mafee? You?

29:44.157 --> 29:45.533
Ben Kim told me
I'd be meeting

29:45.533 --> 29:47.202
a trader friend of his
from Wharton.

29:47.202 --> 29:50.205
And he invited me here to share
some dragon fruit rippage.

29:52.040 --> 29:54.209
This spot is more my vibe
than yours,

29:54.209 --> 29:55.794
so I think you should be
the one to leave.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.129
Fuck that. You probably
got all this shit at home.

29:58.129 --> 29:59.714
- You go.
- Yeah.

29:59.714 --> 30:01.090
Figures you wouldn't back down.

30:01.090 --> 30:04.135
Even when absolutely nothing
is on the line.

30:05.678 --> 30:07.764
Never change, dude.

30:07.764 --> 30:09.599
Fucking A, I won't.

30:11.309 --> 30:13.102
All right, look...

30:15.313 --> 30:17.941
I could use your help
with something.

30:21.528 --> 30:23.112
A play.

30:26.032 --> 30:28.409
Look, I'll buy you a round

30:28.409 --> 30:32.163
of the fucking pipe or whatever.

30:32.163 --> 30:33.748
If I'm gonna do
something for you,

30:33.748 --> 30:36.084
you're gonna need to do
something for me first.

30:36.084 --> 30:37.544
You goddamn baby!

30:37.544 --> 30:39.671
- I am asking you for help.
- Later.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.297
Fine!

30:42.590 --> 30:44.092
What do you want?

30:44.092 --> 30:46.302
An apology.

30:50.515 --> 30:52.517
Ramone, Joseph?

30:55.937 --> 30:58.231
Thanks.

31:01.442 --> 31:04.571
So, what brings you in
tonight, Joseph?

31:04.571 --> 31:08.366
Yeah, actually a friend
recommended this place to me.

31:08.366 --> 31:10.743
I've been feeling
fatigue lately.

31:10.743 --> 31:12.704
I keep falling asleep
on the job.

31:12.704 --> 31:15.290
I work security at a club,
so it's late nights.

31:15.290 --> 31:17.709
My buddy said you could
maybe help me out

31:17.709 --> 31:18.918
with a little something?

31:18.918 --> 31:20.753
And what's the name
of your friend?

31:20.753 --> 31:22.672
His nickname's Sweaty John.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.008
Or Johnny Sweats.

31:25.008 --> 31:26.551
Sometimes they call him
Johnny the Sweater.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.928
That means nothing to me.
What's his real name?

31:28.928 --> 31:31.556
- John.
- John what?

31:31.556 --> 31:34.392
I don't know what you
or your friend think we do here,

31:34.392 --> 31:36.019
Mr. Ramone,
but I can assure you

31:36.019 --> 31:38.271
we prescribe medication
in accordance with the law.

31:38.271 --> 31:40.023
So you either
get wise to the fact

31:40.023 --> 31:41.983
that this isn't
a UConn frat house,

31:41.983 --> 31:43.693
or you get the fuck
out of my office.

31:43.693 --> 31:44.819
My apologies, Doc.

31:44.819 --> 31:46.738
It's just, I did
some digging around,

31:46.738 --> 31:50.491
and, uh, I have records showing
that this office purchased

31:50.491 --> 31:55.496
$138k worth of surgical-grade
cocaine last year.

31:55.496 --> 31:56.831
It also happened to be a year

31:56.831 --> 31:58.458
in which you performed
zero surgeries.

31:58.458 --> 32:01.044
- What the fuck do you want?
- It's simple, actually.

32:01.044 --> 32:02.211
You work for Korlera,

32:02.211 --> 32:03.963
a company that I'd
like to see do well.

32:03.963 --> 32:06.049
- That lawsuit--
- The equipment malfunctioned.

32:06.049 --> 32:07.592
It was tragic
but unavoidable.

32:07.592 --> 32:09.928
Yeah, see, that-that
rationale doesn't work for me.

32:09.928 --> 32:11.512
You're going to admit that, actually,

32:11.512 --> 32:13.681
there was no equipment malfunction.

32:13.681 --> 32:16.601
That the error
was all human. Yours.

32:16.601 --> 32:18.144
Who the fuck do you think
you are?

32:18.144 --> 32:21.397
Otherwise I sound the alarm
on your coke operation.

32:22.231 --> 32:23.816
My life gets blown up
either way.

32:23.816 --> 32:25.360
Why would I do it
the way that helps you?

32:25.360 --> 32:27.695
'Cause everybody
understands a mistake.

32:28.363 --> 32:30.448
I think the medical board
will be less understanding

32:30.448 --> 32:33.618
about the kilos of schneef
you've been hawking.

32:39.165 --> 32:42.293
Real interesting meeting with
your trader friend last night,

32:42.293 --> 32:43.670
Ben Kim.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.004
I know I was dishonest,

32:45.004 --> 32:47.423
but I just wanted you two
to resolve your differences.

32:47.423 --> 32:48.549
It was an ambush.

32:48.549 --> 32:50.385
- Did it work?
- Dollar Bill.

32:50.385 --> 32:51.719
Long time no see.

32:51.719 --> 32:53.262
I saw you yesterday, dude.

32:53.262 --> 32:55.264
And yet I've heard
everyone else's best idea.

32:55.264 --> 32:56.975
You got something for me?

32:57.934 --> 32:59.477
Yeah, yeah, sorry about that.

32:59.477 --> 33:01.604
Uh, I've just been a little
too busy making this firm

33:01.604 --> 33:03.773
- bathtubs full of money.
- I know what that means.

33:03.773 --> 33:06.150
Whatever moves you're making
probably shady as shit.

33:06.150 --> 33:08.987
Right on brand, though.

33:09.654 --> 33:10.989
Uh, you came to me,

33:10.989 --> 33:14.033
you and Taylor,
and begged me to come back here.

33:14.033 --> 33:16.536
You didn't hire
Melinda fucking Gates.

33:16.536 --> 33:17.996
You know how I operate,

33:17.996 --> 33:19.789
and if my moves aren't
ethical enough for you,

33:19.789 --> 33:21.499
then I can just take
the rest of the day off

33:21.499 --> 33:22.625
and go race for a cure.

33:22.625 --> 33:24.961
You talk a big game.

33:24.961 --> 33:26.587
But you know what separates
a real earner

33:26.587 --> 33:28.965
from a blowhard
in a fleece Snuggie?

33:28.965 --> 33:30.967
Forethought.

33:30.967 --> 33:32.593
When you go rogue,
you put the entire fund

33:32.593 --> 33:34.262
and all of your colleagues
in jeopardy.

33:34.262 --> 33:36.931
You get the SEC to give
this whole place a colonoscopy,

33:36.931 --> 33:39.475
not to mention Prince's run
is dead as soon as it's started.

33:39.475 --> 33:40.768
And you can be sure I'll be

33:40.768 --> 33:42.395
pointing at you
for the blame on that.

33:42.395 --> 33:43.813
God, just when I thought
I'd finally

33:43.813 --> 33:46.357
make employee of the month.

33:46.357 --> 33:47.859
Well, if you insist
on freeballing it,

33:47.859 --> 33:50.194
here's what I can guarantee
for you:

33:50.194 --> 33:52.363
your life on this floor
will be misery.

33:52.363 --> 33:54.407
I'll make Spyros
your personal wet nurse.

33:54.407 --> 33:57.160
He'll share your desk.
You'll suckle at his teat.

33:57.160 --> 33:59.245
Drink up, sweet baby boy.

33:59.245 --> 34:00.663
Gross.

34:00.663 --> 34:02.415
He will be up your ass 24/7.

34:02.415 --> 34:05.376
Oh, I'll be up there with
a miner's helmet and a pickaxe,

34:05.376 --> 34:06.586
spelunking for all--

34:06.586 --> 34:08.212
- I got this.
- Sorry.

34:08.212 --> 34:09.589
I will require you
to complete

34:09.589 --> 34:11.549
weekly anger management trainings

34:11.549 --> 34:12.842
outside of work hours.

34:12.842 --> 34:15.428
I will project all of your chats
and web searches

34:15.428 --> 34:16.596
onto the televisions.

34:16.596 --> 34:18.014
Do that,
and you're gonna get a view

34:18.014 --> 34:19.557
of my firm ass walking
out the door.

34:19.557 --> 34:22.018
- Bluffing.
- How the fuck would you know?

34:22.018 --> 34:24.103
You want to find out?

34:24.103 --> 34:26.773
Let's go, tough guy.

34:31.944 --> 34:35.323
One round of liar's poker.
I win, you get off my dick.

34:35.323 --> 34:37.533
And I win, you loop me in
on everything.

34:37.533 --> 34:39.160
Done.

34:39.160 --> 34:41.788
Wow, this is so good.

34:43.581 --> 34:45.416
Ohh! You know what?

34:45.416 --> 34:48.628
I bet you wanted me to do that,
and you fucking memorized it.

34:48.628 --> 34:50.421
Good read.

34:51.506 --> 34:53.591
Nice fucking try.

34:56.803 --> 34:58.304
Pair of aces.

34:58.304 --> 35:00.098
Those are 1s,
in case you're confused.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.933
I'm aware. Trip 3s.

35:02.934 --> 35:04.393
Quad 5s.

35:07.897 --> 35:10.441
No answers for you there,
school child.

35:11.818 --> 35:13.236
Six 8s.

35:13.236 --> 35:14.612
Oh, smells like an overbid.

35:14.612 --> 35:17.573
Yikes.

35:17.573 --> 35:20.243
No way, buddy,
since I only got one.

35:20.243 --> 35:21.994
Call.

35:24.789 --> 35:26.833
No fucking way.

35:27.959 --> 35:29.669
No fucking way

35:29.669 --> 35:31.587
you got five 8s on this bill.

35:33.923 --> 35:35.049
This is a ringer.

35:35.049 --> 35:36.634
You've been holding it for this.

35:36.634 --> 35:38.177
Was I?

35:42.140 --> 35:43.307
Huh.

35:50.690 --> 35:51.691
Ah!

35:51.691 --> 35:54.569
And if you did, I love it.

35:54.569 --> 35:56.571
Fucking hell!

35:56.571 --> 35:58.739
This guy's a fucking badass!

35:58.739 --> 36:00.408
<i>Olé, toreador.</i>

36:02.201 --> 36:03.953
Damn!

36:06.330 --> 36:09.125
Philip punched the bully
right in the mouth.

36:09.125 --> 36:11.669
This is the best thing that's
ever happened on this floor.

36:11.669 --> 36:13.838
He's got that Winston Dick
energy happening.

36:13.838 --> 36:16.007
And you ruined it.

36:21.345 --> 36:22.972
The stock popped. How?

36:22.972 --> 36:24.599
Turns out the equipment
wasn't faulty.

36:24.599 --> 36:27.185
The mistake was human.
Doc confessed.

36:27.185 --> 36:28.603
Well done.

36:28.603 --> 36:29.937
Um, I'm out the rest of the day.

36:29.937 --> 36:31.564
- During trading?
- Got to go to Buffalo,

36:31.564 --> 36:34.442
get that fucking bag
back from my grandparents,

36:34.442 --> 36:36.527
take 'em to a real doctor.

36:40.114 --> 36:41.532
You celebrating?

36:41.532 --> 36:43.534
In this game,
you got to celebrate the wins

36:43.534 --> 36:45.119
because they are uncommon.

36:45.119 --> 36:47.288
The win is you strolling
through that door again.

36:47.288 --> 36:49.707
I don't stroll. I stride.
With purpose.

36:49.707 --> 36:52.043
And is that purpose merely
to congratulate me

36:52.043 --> 36:55.004
for making an investment that
accomplished the impossible:

36:55.004 --> 36:57.715
giant financial upside
and huge societal good?

36:57.715 --> 36:59.467
Or is it to come onboard?

36:59.467 --> 37:01.219
No, we're not quite there yet.

37:01.219 --> 37:03.888
Got to meet the wife.

37:03.888 --> 37:06.349
Can't sign on without meeting
the candidate's life partner.

37:06.349 --> 37:07.558
Andy just got in town.

37:07.558 --> 37:08.976
I'll have the office
reach out to set a time.

37:08.976 --> 37:11.520
- Great.
- It really is.

37:21.822 --> 37:24.116
Every jackoff is in on Solana.

37:24.116 --> 37:26.327
There is a hard fork
coming for ETH.

37:26.327 --> 37:28.287
We're getting ahead of it.

37:28.287 --> 37:31.123
You're walking around blind
without a cane, pal.

37:31.123 --> 37:33.167
A fool and his crypto
are lucky enough

37:33.167 --> 37:34.669
to get together
in the first place.

37:34.669 --> 37:38.589
All the traders would
emulate you in small ways,

37:38.589 --> 37:41.008
but now you have
an actual Mini Me.

37:42.134 --> 37:44.262
He was always a chip
off the old block.

37:44.262 --> 37:47.515
I fought it for
as long as I could, but now--

37:47.515 --> 37:50.101
You just said "fuck it"
and handed him a chisel.

37:51.018 --> 37:52.520
Pretty much.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.855
You know, I know
there's a downside.

37:54.855 --> 37:57.441
You can't escape passing on
some of your damage,

37:57.441 --> 37:59.443
even if he did get
the twinkle in the eye

37:59.443 --> 38:00.861
and the killer instincts.

38:00.861 --> 38:02.655
There. That.

38:03.155 --> 38:04.365
A couple of years ago,

38:04.365 --> 38:05.866
you wouldn't have seen
any downside.

38:05.866 --> 38:07.660
You would have just
fucking loved the way

38:07.660 --> 38:10.579
Gordie was turning out.

38:10.579 --> 38:11.956
You've changed too,
you know.

38:11.956 --> 38:13.207
You've done something

38:13.207 --> 38:16.919
few people are actually able
to accomplish.

38:16.919 --> 38:18.421
You've evolved.

38:18.421 --> 38:21.632
Next you're gonna tell me
you've changed...

38:21.632 --> 38:23.342
and that we're different
than we were

38:23.342 --> 38:25.261
when we wanted each other.

38:25.928 --> 38:27.471
Do you disagree?

38:29.181 --> 38:30.641
No.

38:32.101 --> 38:33.644
We have changed.

38:35.021 --> 38:36.939
Out of a hundred
alternate universes,

38:36.939 --> 38:39.734
you and me probably
end up together in 95.

38:39.734 --> 38:42.862
Well, this is one
of the other five.

38:43.696 --> 38:45.531
If you come back with us,

38:45.531 --> 38:47.867
things would be different.

38:49.577 --> 38:51.287
And what happens
to the Wendy Rhoades

38:51.287 --> 38:55.499
living in the universe
where Mike Prince is president?

38:57.918 --> 39:01.213
A lot of billionaires feel
they never have enough.

39:02.673 --> 39:04.050
It's the driver.

39:04.050 --> 39:06.844
But I've learned that there is
such a thing as too much.

39:06.844 --> 39:09.680
Too much ego,
too much power.

39:09.680 --> 39:11.724
Prince is over that line.

39:11.724 --> 39:14.101
And why it is on you
to step in?

39:14.101 --> 39:15.311
Because I'm looking around,

39:15.311 --> 39:16.896
wondering who else
is gonna stop him,

39:16.896 --> 39:20.107
and I've realized
the only answer is us.

39:20.107 --> 39:23.527
So much has happened
to what we built, Bobby.

39:23.527 --> 39:25.446
And against all odds,
I'm still there.

39:25.446 --> 39:27.948
And I-I'm not saying
it all happened for a reason,

39:27.948 --> 39:29.700
or any bullshit like that.

39:29.700 --> 39:31.577
I just know how I'll feel

39:31.577 --> 39:33.371
if I see it coming
and do nothing.

39:33.371 --> 39:36.707
Well, you're putting me
in that place now, too,

39:36.707 --> 39:38.042
by telling me this.

39:39.335 --> 39:41.587
Oops.

39:41.587 --> 39:44.215
You need me to do this with you,
or you want me to?

39:44.215 --> 39:47.843
- You have to ask me that?
- Well, the Wendy Rhoades I knew,

39:47.843 --> 39:49.970
she could break Mike Prince
down and reassemble him

39:49.970 --> 39:52.014
faster than a pit crew
at Talladega.

39:52.014 --> 39:54.517
I still can.
And the Robert Axelrod I know

39:54.517 --> 39:57.061
would still be nursing
a grudge.

39:57.645 --> 40:00.022
Despite the grand tour
of Castle Axelrod

40:00.022 --> 40:02.024
and Gordie Gekko's
crypto brilliance,

40:02.024 --> 40:03.192
I'm not buying it.

40:03.192 --> 40:04.985
Mike Prince
has wronged many,

40:04.985 --> 40:07.405
but you're the one
he took from.

40:07.405 --> 40:08.739
And as evolved as you are,

40:08.739 --> 40:10.658
that's not something
I see you getting over,

40:10.658 --> 40:12.785
in this or any other universe.

40:12.785 --> 40:14.745
Okay.

40:14.745 --> 40:16.539
So you have my reason
figured out.

40:16.539 --> 40:18.040
What's yours?

40:18.040 --> 40:19.458
And don't say
you just told me,

40:19.458 --> 40:21.127
because that was only
half of it.

40:21.127 --> 40:22.670
You think I'm holding out
on you?

40:22.670 --> 40:25.214
No, I just don't think
you have the words

40:25.214 --> 40:27.425
for yourself yet either.

40:29.301 --> 40:30.886
Do it now.

40:35.933 --> 40:37.977
We've moved markets.

40:37.977 --> 40:42.481
We've built up
and torn down companies.

40:43.858 --> 40:46.944
We've created some jobs,
destroyed others.

40:48.571 --> 40:51.699
But sticking my fingers
into a presidential election?

40:51.699 --> 40:53.951
Changing the course of history?

40:55.744 --> 40:58.122
I've never interfered that much.

40:59.582 --> 41:01.959
If we came here...

41:03.127 --> 41:05.045
and made the case to you...

41:05.546 --> 41:09.467
and you believed it was worth
joining our cause...

41:10.509 --> 41:12.303
I would have no doubts.

41:13.512 --> 41:16.182
I have your voice
in my head, too.

41:16.182 --> 41:18.225
I run things by you.

41:18.225 --> 41:19.810
Like when I first got here

41:19.810 --> 41:22.396
and I didn't know how the hell
I was gonna go on.

41:22.396 --> 41:26.358
All of this,
this was you, not me.

41:26.358 --> 41:28.194
But you're right.

41:29.195 --> 41:31.697
Prince is in my head.

41:31.697 --> 41:36.785
I think about him sitting
in my chair, behind my desk.

41:36.785 --> 41:40.331
He replaced
all the furniture.

41:40.331 --> 41:42.458
But yes,
it's never looked right.

41:42.458 --> 41:44.627
It's not right.

41:54.845 --> 41:56.722
I love breaking bread
with you, pal,

41:56.722 --> 41:59.934
but I hate to ruin
your appetite.

41:59.934 --> 42:01.810
Did you talk
to the president?

42:01.810 --> 42:04.897
Even in light of your recent
vindication in state court,

42:04.897 --> 42:06.565
he feels it would be
an overreach.

42:06.565 --> 42:07.816
He can't be seen doing

42:07.816 --> 42:12.154
a backbend as an arbitrary
partisan favor.

42:12.154 --> 42:16.825
Well, maybe the, uh, problem
isn't what the argument is

42:16.825 --> 42:18.702
as much as who is making it.

42:18.702 --> 42:23.082
I realized that neither you
nor I could present this case,

42:23.082 --> 42:27.044
so I found the one man
who could.

42:27.836 --> 42:29.713
Solicitor General.

42:33.884 --> 42:36.845
<i>I, Waylon Jeffcoat,
am now newly of the belief</i>

42:36.845 --> 42:40.015
<i>that I wrongly
had Chuck Rhoades fired</i>

42:40.015 --> 42:42.017
<i>from his position
as United States attorney</i>

42:42.017 --> 42:44.186
<i>for the Southern District
of New York.</i>

42:44.186 --> 42:47.314
<i>While we may not see eye to eye
on account of his stature</i>

42:47.314 --> 42:48.649
<i>and his values,</i>

42:48.649 --> 42:52.069
<i>Mr. Rhoades is undoubtedly
a tenacious prosecutor,</i>

42:52.069 --> 42:53.571
<i>and some might say</i>

42:53.571 --> 42:55.614
<i>an attribute
to the legal profession.</i>

42:55.614 --> 42:59.451
<i>It was not my place
to yank him from service</i>

42:59.451 --> 43:01.036
<i>before he had ripened.</i>

43:01.036 --> 43:02.788
How in the name of God and Texas

43:02.788 --> 43:07.251
and all that is holy did you get
Jock Jeffcoat to say that?

43:09.962 --> 43:11.297
Open it.

43:11.297 --> 43:13.424
There you go.

43:32.234 --> 43:34.111
Yeah.

43:34.111 --> 43:35.029
Oh!

43:35.029 --> 43:37.281
"How beautiful
on the mountains

43:37.281 --> 43:41.452
are the feet of those
who bring good news."

43:44.580 --> 43:46.540
My dogs have been barking, Chuck.

43:46.540 --> 43:49.418
I suppose in exchange
for this gift,

43:49.418 --> 43:51.420
I can give you
some good news.

43:51.420 --> 43:54.089
- You got a camera phone?
- I do.

43:55.257 --> 43:58.385
I made him an offer
that was just the right size.

43:58.385 --> 44:00.638
Well, whatever the hell
that means,

44:00.638 --> 44:02.348
you did the undoable.

44:02.348 --> 44:05.643
Now, Karl here
is sharing his creamed spinach

44:05.643 --> 44:07.728
with a couple of producers
from <i>48 Hours.</i>

44:07.728 --> 44:09.688
Isn't that right, Karl?

44:09.688 --> 44:11.940
Not just producers.
Co-exec producers.

44:11.940 --> 44:13.817
Karl, are you suggesting
they might be interested

44:13.817 --> 44:15.152
in airing this video?

44:15.152 --> 44:18.364
Was Geoffrey Holder
interested in uncola nuts?

44:20.491 --> 44:22.409
That's a yes.

44:22.409 --> 44:23.702
Jesus, Karl.

44:23.702 --> 44:25.287
Thank you.

44:28.332 --> 44:29.875
Not every day
you see a former

44:29.875 --> 44:31.293
Attorney General
of the United States

44:31.293 --> 44:33.420
issue an apology
from a jail cell.

44:33.420 --> 44:36.590
Seems the president can either
hop onboard when it airs

44:36.590 --> 44:39.593
or explain why he's not
righting a wrong

44:39.593 --> 44:43.305
committed by the Justice
Department he now oversees.

45:16.839 --> 45:18.549
Thank you, Bill.

45:20.968 --> 45:22.177
Thank you.

45:22.177 --> 45:25.431
I'm a little more used to buying
gifts for the women in my life.

45:25.431 --> 45:29.351
Well, I too love chocolate
and your affection.

45:29.351 --> 45:32.396
And I'm so happy you and Mafee
are working together again.

45:32.396 --> 45:34.523
Oh, we're gonna make bank.

45:34.523 --> 45:36.108
That was the plan.

45:36.108 --> 45:39.069
Next time, let me in,

45:39.069 --> 45:40.320
and I'll send Spyros away

45:40.320 --> 45:41.864
to work on his
Continuing Ed credits

45:41.864 --> 45:43.157
to get him off your dick.

45:43.157 --> 45:46.118
Ugh, no, I-I can't say
thank you more than once a week.

45:46.118 --> 45:48.036
The words won't form
in my mouth.

45:48.036 --> 45:49.413
I know. I know.

45:49.413 --> 45:53.751
Just remember, I'm here to earn,
not sell fucking cookies.

46:08.265 --> 46:10.184
I hate to be the one
to say it, sonny,

46:10.184 --> 46:13.395
but if the call were coming,
it would have come by now.

46:15.189 --> 46:19.610
It's indecent to phone a man
in his home after 9 p.m.

46:19.610 --> 46:20.778
Mm-hmm.

46:20.778 --> 46:22.196
Well, listen,
you took your shot,

46:22.196 --> 46:24.156
and either way,
with your popularity

46:24.156 --> 46:25.783
and Jock's apology,

46:25.783 --> 46:28.118
there are dozens of positions
of equal stature.

46:40.380 --> 46:42.132
Spam.

46:49.139 --> 46:51.600
You really think
this is necessary?

46:51.600 --> 46:52.893
This guy's thorough.

46:52.893 --> 46:54.812
We've got to be
two steps ahead.

46:54.812 --> 46:56.104
Then this isn't enough.

46:56.104 --> 46:57.815
What do you mean?
You even used the toothbrush.

46:57.815 --> 47:01.151
Remember back when we had dinner
with that couple, the Merricks?

47:01.151 --> 47:02.653
There was a weird energy
between them.

47:02.653 --> 47:04.363
- We talked about it afterwards.
- That's right.

47:04.363 --> 47:06.490
We said it was obvious
they hadn't had sex in months.

47:06.490 --> 47:10.452
They got divorced
right after that.

47:10.452 --> 47:13.747
His affair came out,
and he never made CEO.

47:13.747 --> 47:15.916
My point is, we could tell.

47:15.916 --> 47:18.293
- Oh.
- Yeah.

47:19.044 --> 47:20.671
You see?

47:21.880 --> 47:23.507
So, we...

47:26.510 --> 47:28.554
You been seeing people
recently?

47:28.554 --> 47:30.639
Yeah, but I've been safe.

47:31.557 --> 47:33.976
I got tested before I came out,
just to be sure.

47:35.477 --> 47:36.979
You?

47:36.979 --> 47:39.147
I've been safe.

47:40.065 --> 47:41.567
Fucking mood killer.

47:41.567 --> 47:44.319
Maybe we need something
to help out a little.

47:44.319 --> 47:45.737
I don't need Viagra.

47:45.737 --> 47:49.157
No, no.
I was thinking Molly.

47:58.500 --> 48:00.419
Well...

48:00.419 --> 48:02.254
I'm cashing it in
for the night.

48:02.254 --> 48:05.173
You'll find something in D.C.,
like Ira said.

48:05.173 --> 48:08.010
And then you'll get used
to the commute.

48:08.010 --> 48:10.304
Enough. Right?

48:10.304 --> 48:12.222
Let's not play the funeral dirge

48:12.222 --> 48:15.100
while my eyes
are still open.

48:22.566 --> 48:24.109
Yes, this is he.

48:26.028 --> 48:27.738
Please put him through.

48:34.411 --> 48:36.246
Mr. President...

48:36.246 --> 48:39.791
it is an honor
to hear from you.

48:49.301 --> 48:50.928
You feeling anything?

48:51.845 --> 48:53.805
Not yet. You?

48:55.724 --> 48:57.559
No, not yet.

48:58.894 --> 49:00.270
You want to play some music?

49:00.270 --> 49:01.980
Anita Baker, maybe?

49:04.024 --> 49:05.275
Like that time at college,

49:05.275 --> 49:06.902
in your parents' place
by the lake?

49:06.902 --> 49:09.655
How could that be the only album
they had in the whole cottage?

49:09.655 --> 49:11.406
Hey, it covered the sounds.

49:11.406 --> 49:13.992
They never knew
you snuck into my room.

49:14.952 --> 49:16.495
I think they knew.

49:16.495 --> 49:19.498
Why else would your dad make
our wedding band sing

49:19.498 --> 49:21.959
"Giving You the Best
That I Got"?

49:23.126 --> 49:24.795
Ugh. They knew.

49:24.795 --> 49:26.421
Yeah.

49:32.344 --> 49:33.637
Whoa.

49:33.637 --> 49:35.180
Hmm.

49:36.556 --> 49:38.308
Here we go.

50:07.838 --> 50:09.548
Have you decided?

50:13.677 --> 50:16.013
It ain't me, babe.

50:17.639 --> 50:19.766
And not because I think
you're wrong about Prince.

50:19.766 --> 50:22.060
Or because I don't want
to be there for you three,

50:22.060 --> 50:23.353
who have each, over time,

50:23.353 --> 50:25.188
earned my serious consideration,

50:25.188 --> 50:27.315
respect, even love.

50:27.315 --> 50:29.359
- Then why?
- Because America,

50:29.359 --> 50:31.236
the land of the free,

50:31.236 --> 50:33.447
isn't that for me anymore.

50:33.447 --> 50:35.657
And I can't see
how it ever will be.

50:35.657 --> 50:38.243
'Cause Prince
is only on the ascent,

50:38.243 --> 50:40.829
and I don't engage
in wars of attrition anymore.

50:40.829 --> 50:42.080
Because Chuck is a free man

50:42.080 --> 50:43.582
who never relents
and never stops,

50:43.582 --> 50:45.375
and I remain
the one that got away.

50:45.375 --> 50:49.838
But mostly
because I have a better idea.

50:49.838 --> 50:51.840
Come with me.

50:56.887 --> 50:58.722
Your office.

51:00.307 --> 51:02.350
Ample space for each of you.

51:03.310 --> 51:06.229
Whatever you need,
we can get.

51:08.482 --> 51:11.651
This wasn't ever about us
convincing you to come back.

51:11.651 --> 51:15.822
It was always about you
showing us why we should stay.

51:15.822 --> 51:17.282
You're my people.

51:17.282 --> 51:20.035
And all the things we can
no longer have in the States,

51:20.035 --> 51:21.703
we have here.

51:22.329 --> 51:24.581
Freedom. Opportunity.

51:24.581 --> 51:26.708
Self-determination.

51:26.708 --> 51:27.876
Each other.

51:27.876 --> 51:29.503
Nothing puts a smile on my face

51:29.503 --> 51:32.005
like Bobby Axelrod making moves
I never saw coming.

51:32.005 --> 51:33.256
And think of all those moves

51:33.256 --> 51:35.217
that we can make
together again, Wags.

51:35.217 --> 51:37.844
Oh, I am. I truly am.

51:37.844 --> 51:39.262
So you're in?

51:39.262 --> 51:41.598
Had you asked me three days ago
when we just arrived, Maestro,

51:41.598 --> 51:43.225
I might have jumped
into your arms

51:43.225 --> 51:44.684
just out of raw emotion.

51:44.684 --> 51:48.438
But what we've said
about Prince is true.

51:49.397 --> 51:50.899
The mere fact
that you're frightened

51:50.899 --> 51:53.151
of what he might do to you
should you engage again--

51:53.151 --> 51:54.444
I never used that word.

51:54.444 --> 51:56.613
A man who defeated you
in the way that he did,

51:56.613 --> 51:58.532
in the manner that he did,

51:58.532 --> 52:00.659
leaving you wounded
but not dead.

52:00.659 --> 52:04.371
Who are we if we see how smart

52:04.371 --> 52:05.997
and dangerous and capable he is,

52:05.997 --> 52:07.457
and yet we choose to walk away?

52:07.457 --> 52:09.626
You'd be survivors.

52:10.752 --> 52:11.837
Truth is, Taylor,

52:11.837 --> 52:13.255
you can do more good
in this world

52:13.255 --> 52:14.798
getting to your number
than you ever could

52:14.798 --> 52:17.592
by trying to take down
Mike Prince.

52:17.592 --> 52:18.927
You come work with me again,

52:18.927 --> 52:22.889
I guarantee you,
we will get you to a billion

52:22.889 --> 52:24.808
within 36 months.

52:25.725 --> 52:26.726
This is it.

52:26.726 --> 52:28.812
It's what you've been
waiting for.

52:30.313 --> 52:34.359
If I do the math, and, like you,
I can't help doing the math,

52:34.359 --> 52:35.652
if I run the simulation,

52:35.652 --> 52:37.779
Prince gets elected
maybe 9.8% of the time.

52:37.779 --> 52:42.325
But the consequences of that,
if it happens, are too great.

52:43.076 --> 52:45.495
I can't abandon the fight.

52:49.124 --> 52:52.294
I once asked a very smart man
if I needed citizenship

52:52.294 --> 52:54.045
in a country other
than the United States

52:54.045 --> 52:55.505
if things went bad
back at home.

52:55.505 --> 52:58.008
And he said,
"If it gets that bad there,

52:58.008 --> 53:01.553
there's nowhere you can go
that won't be touched by it."

53:01.553 --> 53:04.556
So, what am I
buying myself here?

53:04.556 --> 53:06.892
Not enough, I'm afraid.

53:06.892 --> 53:11.605
Plus, I like air conditioning,

53:11.605 --> 53:16.985
Big Macs and baseball too much
to ever really leave.

53:22.741 --> 53:24.117
Seems like you got out
early enough

53:24.117 --> 53:26.286
not to feel tied
to this thing.

53:26.286 --> 53:27.954
I envy that.

53:27.954 --> 53:30.415
No, you're a better man
than me, Wend.

53:30.415 --> 53:32.000
As usual.

53:32.000 --> 53:35.003
I really didn't want to have
to say goodbye to you again.

53:35.003 --> 53:36.254
Yeah.

53:36.254 --> 53:37.923
I know.

53:51.061 --> 53:55.273
My own take on Prince
right now is this:

53:55.273 --> 53:57.776
You can't bring him down,

53:57.776 --> 53:59.444
so you should help him.

53:59.444 --> 54:01.613
Get him elected.

54:01.613 --> 54:03.448
That how you get him
out of your way

54:03.448 --> 54:05.200
once and for all.

54:19.881 --> 54:22.217
And how long have you been
based out of Colorado, Andy?

54:22.217 --> 54:24.469
Since the girls
started college.

54:24.469 --> 54:26.096
We all lived together
until then.

54:26.096 --> 54:27.889
And even then,
once I was based out there,

54:27.889 --> 54:30.308
I'm back east so much, we're
gonna have to do a lot of work

54:30.308 --> 54:32.102
to hide the plane's
carbon footprint.

54:33.019 --> 54:35.605
It was the best arrangement

54:35.605 --> 54:38.066
for us to be able
to each pursue our passions.

54:38.066 --> 54:41.194
We wanted to model that
for our daughters.

54:41.194 --> 54:42.821
Well, I-I think
it worked out well.

54:42.821 --> 54:44.447
Yeah, it did.

54:46.491 --> 54:47.450
And now?

54:47.450 --> 54:49.244
I always knew
this day would come.

54:49.244 --> 54:50.537
We've been planning for it.

54:50.537 --> 54:52.497
And I'm ready to do
whatever it takes,

54:52.497 --> 54:54.457
including living here
with Mike.

54:57.127 --> 54:59.129
Good.

55:00.714 --> 55:03.049
Let's take a quick break, huh?

55:03.049 --> 55:05.343
- Where's your restroom?
- Uh, just there.

55:41.838 --> 55:43.381
I have a lot of respect
for how you two

55:43.381 --> 55:44.883
have handled
your relationship.

55:44.883 --> 55:48.011
Conflicting ambitions
are a difficult thing to manage,

55:48.011 --> 55:50.055
and you've built
a good arrangement.

55:50.055 --> 55:51.389
Thanks.

55:51.389 --> 55:52.682
It worked for us.

55:52.682 --> 55:54.017
But the open
part of the marriage

55:54.017 --> 55:56.311
can't continue
during the campaign.

55:59.939 --> 56:01.274
We know that.

56:01.274 --> 56:02.942
How did you?

56:02.942 --> 56:04.027
My job to know.

56:04.027 --> 56:05.862
I heard a whisper,
followed it up.

56:05.862 --> 56:07.864
Couldn't get it confirmed.

56:08.365 --> 56:10.784
Andy's stuff in the bathroom
was a nice touch,

56:10.784 --> 56:13.495
but this layer
of marital harmony

56:13.495 --> 56:14.829
is about one night thick.

56:14.829 --> 56:16.790
And despite how things
have supposedly changed,

56:16.790 --> 56:19.584
the American electorate
isn't ready for a first couple

56:19.584 --> 56:21.795
with an arrangement.

56:23.797 --> 56:25.131
He's good.

56:25.131 --> 56:26.841
So, what now?

56:26.841 --> 56:29.177
I need to wade into the murky
parts of this with you,

56:29.177 --> 56:30.929
and you're gonna
have to let me.

56:30.929 --> 56:33.139
I need to know it all.

56:33.139 --> 56:34.724
- We can do that.
- Good.

56:34.724 --> 56:37.102
Let's start with the names
of all your partners

56:37.102 --> 56:39.396
in the last five years.

56:39.396 --> 56:40.480
What, now?

56:40.480 --> 56:43.400
You can make a list
on your phones.

56:57.038 --> 56:58.665
I'm not reading this
in front of him.

56:58.665 --> 57:02.710
- Yeah, nope.
- I completely understand.

57:15.682 --> 57:17.142
I know that one.

57:17.142 --> 57:19.394
- Three down?
- Four.

57:19.394 --> 57:20.770
How many down does it go?

57:20.770 --> 57:23.982
It's not a competition.
There's neither the room

57:23.982 --> 57:25.692
nor the need
for jealousy of the past.

57:25.692 --> 57:28.111
Let's stay forward-focused.

57:33.032 --> 57:34.784
Okay.

57:35.952 --> 57:39.497
Good. But no more
all-you-can-eat buffet.

57:39.497 --> 57:42.876
It's prix fixe for the both
of you from here on out.

57:42.876 --> 57:44.836
Can you do that?

58:00.101 --> 58:03.521
<i>Catch a boat to England, Baby</i>

58:03.521 --> 58:05.815
<i>Maybe to Spain</i>

58:06.649 --> 58:09.110
<i>Wherever I have gone</i>

58:09.110 --> 58:12.280
<i>Wherever I've been and gone</i>

58:12.280 --> 58:14.699
<i>Wherever I have gone</i>

58:14.699 --> 58:16.951
<i>The blues</i>

58:16.951 --> 58:19.329
<i>Are all the same</i>

58:25.251 --> 58:28.254
<i>Send out for whisky, baby</i>

58:28.254 --> 58:30.548
<i>Send out for gin</i>

58:30.548 --> 58:33.843
<i>Me and room service, honey</i>

58:33.843 --> 58:36.387
<i>Me and room service, babe</i>

58:36.387 --> 58:38.515
<i>Me and room service</i>

58:38.515 --> 58:42.143
<i>Well, we're living
A life of sin</i>

58:51.861 --> 58:54.572
And that is why it's my pleasure
to announce my run

58:54.572 --> 58:56.658
as an independent candidate

58:56.658 --> 58:58.618
for President
of the United States!

59:00.286 --> 59:01.913
Let's do this!

59:07.710 --> 59:09.003
<i>Do you wanna dance</i>

59:09.003 --> 59:10.380
<i>And hold my hand?</i>

59:10.380 --> 59:13.216
<i>Tell me, baby
I'm your lover man</i>

59:13.216 --> 59:14.801
<i>Oh, baby</i>

59:14.801 --> 59:17.387
<i>Do you wanna dance?</i>

59:17.387 --> 59:20.515
<i>Do you wanna dance
Under the moonlight?</i>

59:20.515 --> 59:23.893
<i>Squeeze me, baby,
All through the night</i>

59:23.893 --> 59:25.144
<i>Oh, baby</i>

59:25.144 --> 59:28.856
<i>Do you wanna dance?</i>

59:28.856 --> 59:31.401
<i>Do you, do you, do you,
Do you wanna dance?</i>

59:31.401 --> 59:34.404
<i>Do you, do you,
Do you, do you wanna dance?</i>

59:34.404 --> 59:36.030
<i>Do you, do you, do you</i>

59:36.030 --> 59:39.617
<i>Do you wanna dance?</i>

59:44.247 --> 59:47.500
<i>Do you wanna dance
Under the moonlight?</i>

59:47.500 --> 59:49.877
<i>Squeeze me, baby,
All through the night</i>

59:49.877 --> 59:51.671
<i>Oh, baby</i>

59:51.671 --> 59:54.507
<i>Do you wanna dance?</i>

59:54.507 --> 59:57.844
<i>Do you wanna dance
Under the moonlight?</i>

59:57.844 --> 01:00:00.305
<i>Squeeze me, baby,
All through the night</i>

01:00:00.305 --> 01:00:02.223
<i>Oh, baby</i>

01:00:02.223 --> 01:00:05.268
<i>Do you wanna dance?</i>

01:00:05.268 --> 01:00:07.937
<i>Do you, do you,
Do you, do you wanna dance?</i>

01:00:07.937 --> 01:00:10.898
<i>Do you, do you, do you,
Do you wanna dance?</i>

01:00:10.898 --> 01:00:12.692
<i>Do you, do you, do you</i>

01:00:12.692 --> 01:00:16.654
<i>Do you wanna dance?</i>

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:23.786
<i>Do you, do you,
Do you, do you wanna dance?</i>

01:00:23.786 --> 01:00:26.748
<i>Do you, do you, do you,
Do you wanna dance?</i>

01:00:26.748 --> 01:00:28.541
<i>Do you, do you, do you</i>

01:00:28.541 --> 01:00:31.961
<i>Do you wanna dance?</i>

01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:37.966
<i>Do you, do you, do you...</i>
