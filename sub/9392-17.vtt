00:34.835 --> 00:37.336
All right, see
you guys later.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.171
Me and Brian are
going to play laser tag

00:39.173 --> 00:40.205
with Joe and Quagmire.

00:40.207 --> 00:41.273
What?! No, you're not.

00:41.275 --> 00:42.841
Tonight's our family night.

00:42.843 --> 00:45.310
We agreed that every Sunday,
we'd do something together.

00:45.312 --> 00:46.345
(clears throat)

00:46.347 --> 00:47.446
What?

00:47.448 --> 00:49.314
Oh, nothing. I was just
clearing my throat.

00:49.316 --> 00:51.116
Good. I thought you were
going to say something.

00:51.118 --> 00:52.818
But, Lois, we
already made plans.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.286
Yeah, I can't leae
those guys alone.

00:54.288 --> 00:56.688
Last time they hung out
without me was a disaster.

00:56.690 --> 00:58.323
All right, movie night.

00:58.325 --> 01:00.959
I am so psyched
for <i>Reindeer Games!</i>

01:00.961 --> 01:03.195
What, I thought we
were watching <i>La Vie En Rose.</i>

01:03.197 --> 01:05.130
What do you mean,
<i>Reindeer Games</i> is great!

01:05.132 --> 01:08.200
Everything goes wrong on the one
day it has to go right.

01:08.202 --> 01:10.335
But <i>La Vie En Rose</i>
<i>is a beautiful movie</i>

01:10.337 --> 01:12.371
about the real life tragedy
of Edith Piaf.

01:12.373 --> 01:14.173
Usually Peter woud
break the tie.

01:14.175 --> 01:15.374
Well, Peter
isn't here, is he?!

01:15.376 --> 01:17.309
Because you were
supposed to be watching him,

01:17.311 --> 01:19.178
but you were smoking
marijuana and he drowned!

01:19.180 --> 01:21.180
What? No, he's at
a PTA meeting.

01:21.182 --> 01:23.182
Where the hell
did you get that st?

01:23.184 --> 01:25.584
I don't know! I just can't stand
it when he's not here!

01:25.586 --> 01:27.319
Peter, you've got
every other night of the week

01:27.321 --> 01:28.687
to spend with your buddies.

01:28.689 --> 01:31.156
This is the one night
we've set aside for our family.

01:31.158 --> 01:33.192
Is that really
too much to ask?

01:33.194 --> 01:34.660
(sighs)
I guess you're rig.

01:34.662 --> 01:36.328
Come on, Brian.
Come upstairs.

01:36.330 --> 01:38.964
I wanna show you a freckle on my
sack that I'm concerned about.

01:38.966 --> 01:40.399
It has irregular edges.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.702
(window opening)
BRIAN (whispers): Peter,
what are you doing?

01:43.704 --> 01:45.270
PETER (whispers):
I'm not goin' to Family Night.

01:45.272 --> 01:47.272
My agreeing with Lois
was just pure theater.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.874
Come on, we're
jumping off the roof.

01:48.876 --> 01:50.375
Are you insane?!
We'll kill ourselves!

01:50.377 --> 01:51.777
Don't worry, we can fly.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.879
I got this pixie dust
from a magic fairy.

01:53.881 --> 01:55.280
Either that or it's speed

01:55.282 --> 01:57.015
I got from a transvestite
at a diner.

01:57.017 --> 01:59.017
(snorting)

01:59.019 --> 02:01.253
(yells): It's the speed!
It's the speed from the diner!

02:01.255 --> 02:02.454
Peter, let go of me!

02:02.456 --> 02:04.189
(yells)
Damn it!

02:06.292 --> 02:08.260
So what are we gonna do
for Family Night?

02:08.262 --> 02:11.363
Oh, would you shut up?
All the good people are gone.

02:14.501 --> 02:18.170
Hey!
Welcome to Quahog Laser Tag.

02:18.172 --> 02:20.272
Please pay attention
while I show y'all

02:20.274 --> 02:21.874
how to put on y'all's vests.

02:21.876 --> 02:23.475
Sir, can I use you
to demonstrate?

02:23.477 --> 02:25.944
Thank you, I have
longed for your attention

02:25.946 --> 02:27.646
since the moment I arrived.

02:27.648 --> 02:30.249
Now, put this on
over your shoulders.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.283
Good.

02:31.285 --> 02:33.118
Now, I'm gonna need
you to squats down

02:33.120 --> 02:34.486
like your underwears
is done for,

02:34.488 --> 02:36.522
but you might still
save the jeans.

02:39.626 --> 02:42.828
Now, you's gonna wanna latch the
front to the back like so...

02:42.830 --> 02:44.329
Did everybody get that?

02:44.331 --> 02:47.132
Boy, a lot of heat
comes off you, don't it?

02:47.134 --> 02:50.135
(lasers zapping)

02:50.137 --> 02:52.371
All right, keep an
eye out for Peter.

02:52.373 --> 02:55.541
He's oddly competitive
at this stuff.

02:55.543 --> 02:59.278
Yeah, and he seems to be weirdly
physically fit at this place.

02:59.280 --> 03:01.013
Yeah, it's almost like he has

03:01.015 --> 03:03.615
unrealistic abilities
when we play laser tag.

03:05.485 --> 03:08.253
All right, well, if we just
stick together, then...

03:08.255 --> 03:09.288
Zap! Zap! Zap!

03:09.290 --> 03:10.322
What the...
No way!

03:10.324 --> 03:11.290
How'd you ln
to do tha?

03:11.292 --> 03:13.125
The question isn't how I do it.

03:13.127 --> 03:16.795
It's how I forgive myself
for what I've done.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.130
(zap)

03:18.132 --> 03:20.332
Yeah, winn!
Right her!

03:20.334 --> 03:21.934
All right, pal,
what do I get?

03:21.936 --> 03:23.769
Well, for five dollars,
you could get

03:23.771 --> 03:26.505
your picture in a fake newspaper
with a humorous headline.

03:29.142 --> 03:31.109
Wow, my picture
in the paper.

03:31.111 --> 03:32.611
I didn't even
get that when

03:32.613 --> 03:34.213
I brought that kitten
and gorilla together.

03:34.215 --> 03:36.582
Huh?
Did I tell ya?

03:36.584 --> 03:38.517
Oh, that's beautiful, Peter.

03:38.519 --> 03:41.119
She's taking care of that
kitten like it's her own.

03:41.121 --> 03:44.056
Yep, I knew eventually she'd
stop tearin' 'em in half.

03:48.361 --> 03:50.162
There you two are!

03:50.164 --> 03:51.997
We waited fou
for four ho!

03:51.999 --> 03:53.332
Where the l
have you be!

03:53.334 --> 03:54.633
Look, Lois,
I know you're mad,

03:54.635 --> 03:57.169
but I think this will prove
that I did the right thing.

03:57.171 --> 04:00.005
I put our family
on the map tonight.

04:00.007 --> 04:03.041
No longer will we be
just those faceless nobodies

04:03.043 --> 04:04.676
who brought the bird flu
to Quahog.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.845
You know, there's something
seriously wrong with a man

04:06.847 --> 04:08.847
who always puts
his friends over his family.

04:08.849 --> 04:10.515
Come on, Lois, I think
you're overreacting.

04:10.517 --> 04:12.918
What's so wrong about a guy
hanging out with his buddies?

04:12.920 --> 04:15.254
Buddies?
You're one of his buddies?

04:15.256 --> 04:16.154
Yeah. And you know why?

04:16.156 --> 04:17.322
'Cause I don't try to tell him

04:17.324 --> 04:18.357
what he can and can't do.

04:18.359 --> 04:20.158
Oh, please, Brian.

04:20.160 --> 04:22.327
You're just two people
who live in the same house.

04:22.329 --> 04:23.862
If you didn't,
you'd never hang t

04:23.864 --> 04:25.364
with each or
in a million .

04:25.366 --> 04:27.499
He owns you.
You're his proper.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.167
He used to hang yu
in the garage

04:29.169 --> 04:31.136
so his fender
wouldn't hit the w.

04:31.138 --> 04:34.172
(music playing over radio)
You're there.

04:34.174 --> 04:36.308
You're there!

04:36.310 --> 04:38.510
I couldn't hear y.
The radio was too l.

04:41.180 --> 04:43.248
I'm going to bed.

04:43.250 --> 04:45.150
You know,
Lois is right, Brian.

04:45.152 --> 04:47.252
You think you're Peter's pal,
but you're really not.

04:47.254 --> 04:48.654
You're just his dog.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.522
Well, that's where
you're wrong. Watch this.

04:50.524 --> 04:52.291
Hey, Peter, you want
to go hit the Clam?

04:52.293 --> 04:54.126
Nah, there's no way
she's in the mood.

04:54.128 --> 04:55.994
Let's just go to the bar.
Sounds good.

04:55.996 --> 04:58.196
Headin' to the bar
with my friend, Peter.

04:58.198 --> 04:59.831
You're lying
to yourself, Bria.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.333
Like those girls who insist

05:01.335 --> 05:03.302
their best friends
are attractive.

05:03.304 --> 05:05.937
Oh, Stewie, I can't wait for
you to meet my best friend.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.306
She is so cute.

05:07.308 --> 05:08.473
Yeah, she sounds awesome.

05:08.475 --> 05:10.175
Oh, my God, yeah.
People ask her

05:10.177 --> 05:11.977
if she's a model
all the time.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.345
Here she comes!

05:13.347 --> 05:16.248
(chuckles)
Okay, okay,

05:16.250 --> 05:17.616
that was an extreme example,

05:17.618 --> 05:20.919
but face it, ladies,
your best friends are not hot.

05:24.691 --> 05:27.526
Uh, Peter, your seat belt
back here doesn't work right.

05:27.528 --> 05:29.661
What's gonna happen to you
that hasn't already happened?

05:29.663 --> 05:31.163
Peter, look out
for that car!

05:31.165 --> 05:32.864
(high-pitched tone resonates)

05:32.866 --> 05:34.032
That's not a car.

05:34.034 --> 05:35.334
What is that?!

05:35.336 --> 05:37.402
(all screaming)

05:49.248 --> 05:51.683
Hello?

05:54.287 --> 05:56.321
Hello?

05:57.190 --> 05:58.857
Anybody here?

06:02.628 --> 06:03.829
Hey.

06:03.831 --> 06:05.330
Hey.

06:05.332 --> 06:06.465
Do you work here?

06:06.467 --> 06:08.967
I don't know.
Doesn't look like it.

06:08.969 --> 06:10.135
Who are you?

06:10.137 --> 06:13.305
I... I don't know.
I-I just woke up here.

06:13.307 --> 06:15.307
I seem to be
a heavyset fello.

06:15.309 --> 06:17.376
You do.

06:17.378 --> 06:19.211
Thank God someone
else is here.

06:19.213 --> 06:21.313
You two seem to be the only
ones in this hospital.

06:21.315 --> 06:22.981
No, I'm here, too.

06:22.983 --> 06:24.816
Any of you guys
know what's going on?

06:24.818 --> 06:26.952
I just woke up in
one of these rooms.

06:26.954 --> 06:29.121
I have no idea
how I got here.

06:29.123 --> 06:30.989
I don't even
know who I am.

06:30.991 --> 06:33.959
All I know is,
I'm extremely important

06:33.961 --> 06:36.161
because there are drawings of me
on all the bathroom doors.

06:36.163 --> 06:38.096
See?

06:38.098 --> 06:41.333
It's glued on there, too, so I'm
pretty sure it's permanent.

06:41.335 --> 06:42.667
This is really weird.

06:42.669 --> 06:44.336
We seem perfectly coherent,

06:44.338 --> 06:46.138
it's just we can't
remember who we are.

06:46.140 --> 06:48.340
It's like our identities
have been

06:48.342 --> 06:49.341
wiped out somehow.

06:49.343 --> 06:51.343
Maybe we can find somebody
to help us.

07:01.854 --> 07:03.622
(dial tone droning)

07:03.624 --> 07:06.258
The whole town seems
to be deserted.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.193
Well, if there are
only four of us,

07:08.195 --> 07:09.528
I propose we start a band.

07:09.530 --> 07:12.497
And I propose we call
ourselves Robes of Teal.

07:12.499 --> 07:14.199
Aw, damn it.

07:16.335 --> 07:19.171
Well, we could still be a band
and choose a different name.

07:19.173 --> 07:21.106
Oh, no, Robes of Teal
was the whole thing.

07:37.990 --> 07:40.425
What the hell happened?
Where is everybody?

07:40.427 --> 07:41.793
You don't suppose...

07:41.795 --> 07:44.029
Do you think, we're the
only people on Earth?

07:44.031 --> 07:45.530
I don't know.
I tell ya what,

07:45.532 --> 07:47.666
I'm gonna open up
this bag of Chex Party Mix.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.401
If people don't show up,
then we're it.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.871
Yep, we're it.

07:52.873 --> 07:55.373
All right, look, we know
we woke up in the hospital,

07:55.375 --> 07:57.676
so maybe there was some kind
of catastrophe

07:57.678 --> 07:59.077
that we were all spared.

07:59.079 --> 08:01.313
Or maybe we were all
in some kind of accident.

08:01.315 --> 08:03.148
Well, that would explain
why you're in a wheelchair.

08:03.150 --> 08:05.250
You must have gotten hurt
worse than the rest of us.

08:05.252 --> 08:08.119
Yeah, I got hit so hard,
it knocked my pee into a bag.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.187
None of ts
makes any s.

08:09.189 --> 08:10.422
Where the hell
is everybody?

08:10.424 --> 08:12.257
Well, if we wait
till tax day,

08:12.259 --> 08:13.825
I'm sure the tax man
will show up.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.260
Ha. You should tweet that.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.696
Okay.

08:17.698 --> 08:18.997
(cell phone buzzes)

08:18.999 --> 08:20.332
(laughs)
This guy's hilarious.

08:20.334 --> 08:21.933
I'm gonna retweet this.

08:21.935 --> 08:23.268
(both cell phones buzz)

08:23.270 --> 08:24.769
Huh.
Mm.

08:24.771 --> 08:27.506
Social media is bringing us
all closer together.

08:27.508 --> 08:28.940
Unfollow.

08:31.310 --> 08:32.944
Hey, you know,
if we're all gonnae

08:32.946 --> 08:34.179
tryin' to figure
this out togethe,

08:34.181 --> 08:36.648
maybe it would be easier
if we gave each other names.

08:36.650 --> 08:37.983
That's a great idea.

08:37.985 --> 08:40.118
Hey, maybe my name
is on this collar.

08:40.120 --> 08:42.521
Cremate, don't bury.

08:42.523 --> 08:43.655
Okay, that's a downer.

08:43.657 --> 08:44.990
You know what?

08:44.992 --> 08:46.925
I'm gettin' a feeling
about my name.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.761
I think my name
might be Shirt Pan.

08:49.763 --> 08:51.830
Shirt Pants?
What kind of name is that?

08:51.832 --> 08:53.265
I don't know.
What's your name?

08:53.267 --> 08:55.133
I kinda think
it's Manly Walker.

08:55.135 --> 08:56.501
Wheeler?
No, Walker.

08:56.503 --> 08:58.169
Wheeler?
No, you're not
hearing me right.

08:58.171 --> 08:59.271
It's Walker.

08:59.273 --> 09:00.138
It's probably Wheeler.

09:00.140 --> 09:02.107
I sorta think
my name is Earl.

09:02.109 --> 09:03.942
<i>(My Name is Earl</i> theme plays)

09:03.944 --> 09:05.176
What was that?
I don't know.

09:05.178 --> 09:07.145
Apparently, I made
some sort of reference.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.981
Hey, check it out.
Looks like a bar.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.616
(sighs) I could go
for a stiff one.

09:11.618 --> 09:13.184
I think they got
a pill for that.

09:13.186 --> 09:14.519
Shirt Pants!

09:14.521 --> 09:17.122
Who else but Shirt Pants?

09:17.124 --> 09:19.925
♪ He's Shirt Pants,
Shirt Pants ♪

09:19.927 --> 09:22.260
♪ She's tryin' to remember,
but he really can't ♪

09:22.262 --> 09:24.129
♪ He's Shirt Pants,
Shirt Pants ♪

09:24.131 --> 09:27.399
♪ All I know for sure is I'm
wearing a shirt and pants. ♪

09:28.334 --> 09:29.935
Hello?

09:29.937 --> 09:32.170
♪ A-well-a everybody's heard
about the bird ♪

09:32.172 --> 09:35.307
♪ B-B-Bird, bird, bird,
b-bird's the word... ♪

09:35.309 --> 09:37.175
That's annoying.

09:37.177 --> 09:38.944
BRIAN:
It just doesn't make sense

09:38.946 --> 09:40.145
that there aren't any people.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.846
This couldn't have
happened naturally.

09:41.848 --> 09:44.749
Something must have
caused this, or someone.

09:44.751 --> 09:47.786
Well, when I find that person,
I'm gonna strangle him.

09:47.788 --> 09:50.322
I had a life,
and he took it away from me.

09:50.324 --> 09:52.991
I don't remember it,
but I bet it was pretty good.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.326
Yeah, me, too.

09:54.328 --> 09:56.161
I bet I was a doctor
who had to deal with

09:56.163 --> 09:58.163
a lot of serious stuff,
but always found a way

09:58.165 --> 09:59.230
to keep things light.

10:00.166 --> 10:02.634
Oh, my Go,
she's beaut.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.102
Yeah, she is.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.805
It's not yours.
Yours died.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.340
Yeah, and I bet I answered

10:08.342 --> 10:10.575
the customer complaint line
at a Danish cookie company.

10:10.577 --> 10:13.144
Hello, Danish cookie company.

10:13.146 --> 10:16.181
No, I know they don't
taste very good.

10:16.183 --> 10:18.583
Well, because
they're very dry, aren't they?

10:18.585 --> 10:20.151
I mean, t-they came in a tin,

10:20.153 --> 10:22.287
how fresh did you think
they were gonna be?

10:22.289 --> 10:24.322
Look, it's dark
and freezing in Denmark.

10:24.324 --> 10:26.791
Everybody who made these cookies
has shot themselves.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.461
Well, I bet I did something
really important and exciting.

10:29.463 --> 10:31.196
Like-like maybe I was
a speechwriter

10:31.198 --> 10:33.331
for the first ever
black president.

10:34.934 --> 10:36.434
Hey, can he say
the word "ask"?

10:36.436 --> 10:38.436
Or-or is that a word
we should avoid?

10:38.438 --> 10:41.773
Yea, and I bet you I was the
voice of an animated bird.

10:41.775 --> 10:44.309
(Joe's voice):
I thought I saw a cat.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.945
I did see a cat.

10:46.947 --> 10:49.247
Oh, my God,
look at that.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.251
Wow, that looks
pretty bad.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.352
Is the Chinese
guy dead?

10:54.354 --> 10:55.587
(sniffs)
Wait.

10:55.589 --> 10:58.323
(sniffs)
We-we were in this car.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.924
I can smell us all
in this car!

10:59.926 --> 11:01.459
This must be the accident

11:01.461 --> 11:03.161
that put us all
in the hospital.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.563
See if there's a registration
in the glove compartment.

11:08.334 --> 11:09.801
"Peter Griffin."

11:09.803 --> 11:11.503
One of us is Peter Griffin.

11:11.505 --> 11:13.672
Look at this indent
on the steering wheel.

11:15.875 --> 11:17.008
It's a perfect match.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.009
Oh, my God!

11:18.011 --> 11:19.177
You're Peter Griffin!

11:19.179 --> 11:20.145
Yeah, I am.

11:20.147 --> 11:22.147
And you live
at 31 Spooner Stre.

11:22.149 --> 11:24.249
Finally, a real clue.
Let's go!

11:24.251 --> 11:25.650
Wow, I own a house!

11:25.652 --> 11:26.951
I just hope it doesn't have

11:26.953 --> 11:28.820
one of those mailboxes
that looks like a cow.

11:28.822 --> 11:31.923
<i>I just want to seem cool to</i>
<i>these guys, but I really hope</i>

11:31.925 --> 11:34.426
<i>I have one of those mailboxes</i>
<i>that looks like a cow.</i>

11:34.428 --> 11:36.928
<i>"Moo," says my mailbox.</i>

11:39.632 --> 11:41.166
Well, this is
31 Spooner Street.

11:41.168 --> 11:42.333
I'm home.

11:42.335 --> 11:43.334
All right,
see you guys.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.036
I'm gonna go shove my
hand down my pants

11:45.038 --> 11:46.204
and see if that
goes someplace.

11:48.941 --> 11:51.576
Guys! Guys!
It goes someplace!

11:51.578 --> 11:54.145
(sniffs)
Hang on, I got something.

11:54.147 --> 11:57.148
(sniffing)

11:57.150 --> 11:59.484
I poop a lot on this lawn.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.219
This must be where I live!

12:02.321 --> 12:04.089
Hey, Shirt Pants,
come in here.

12:05.658 --> 12:07.325
Oh, my God!

12:07.327 --> 12:08.793
I know, I know!
You're my owner!

12:08.795 --> 12:10.261
I knew it!
I knew we were pals!

12:10.263 --> 12:12.263
Yeah, I mean, there's
no pictures of me,

12:12.265 --> 12:14.265
but I see you've got a
dog collar and a leash.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.134
And look how big
your doggie cage is.

12:16.136 --> 12:17.202
You could fit
a human in there.

12:17.204 --> 12:19.170
Clearly, you're
a good owner.

12:21.273 --> 12:23.174
It's such a
weird situation.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.110
I-I just think somebody
should be writing about it.

12:25.112 --> 12:26.311
Yeah.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.146
Do you... do you think
it should be me?

12:28.148 --> 12:30.348
S-Should I be the one
writing about this?

12:30.350 --> 12:31.416
Uh, I don't know.

12:31.418 --> 12:33.184
I-I thinkt
should be .

12:33.186 --> 12:35.386
Then just do it, stop talking
about it for God's sake.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.189
Oh, hey, guys.

12:38.191 --> 12:39.491
Well, we got it
all figured out.

12:39.493 --> 12:41.359
Turns out my name
is Glenn Quagmire,

12:41.361 --> 12:42.627
and this is my dog.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.028
JOE:
Hey, you guys!

12:44.030 --> 12:45.263
Hey, I found my house.

12:45.265 --> 12:46.831
Turns out my name's
Joe Swanson,

12:46.833 --> 12:49.100
and I found this
police uniform in my closet.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.301
Do you know
what that means?

12:50.303 --> 12:51.770
I'm a stripper!

12:53.038 --> 12:55.173
Well, it's good
we found out who we all are,

12:55.175 --> 12:56.307
but we still
haven't found out

12:56.309 --> 12:58.176
what the hell happened
to everybody else.

12:58.178 --> 12:59.511
Yeah, I've n
thinking abou,

12:59.513 --> 13:01.312
and I think the
best course of actn

13:01.314 --> 13:04.315
is for us to just go ahead and
start repopulating the Earth.

13:04.317 --> 13:05.750
But there are no women.

13:05.752 --> 13:07.018
Well, let'sy
some stuf.

13:07.020 --> 13:08.787
Hey, you guys want to
see something cool?

13:08.789 --> 13:11.156
There's a bedroom upstairs
that belonged to some girl,

13:11.158 --> 13:12.690
and she's got bras in there,

13:12.692 --> 13:14.359
and the cups are
different sizes.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.127
L-Like one of them's
a martini glass

13:16.129 --> 13:17.829
and the other one's
some kinda melon.

13:20.866 --> 13:23.101
Guys, you know how
we were thinking

13:23.103 --> 13:25.370
that something must have
caused this situation...

13:25.372 --> 13:27.038
or someone?
Yeah?

13:27.040 --> 13:29.007
Look at that.

13:33.779 --> 13:35.013
Oh, my God.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.014
It's him.

13:36.016 --> 13:37.148
He did this.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.149
What do we do?

13:38.151 --> 13:39.317
Check it out.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.518
I got the little
freak's bra.

13:40.520 --> 13:42.020
I'm gonna put it on.

13:43.355 --> 13:45.490
Huh, this actually
fits pretty well.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.158
Oh, wait, there's
a name on it.

13:47.160 --> 13:48.693
It's mine.

13:55.467 --> 13:56.935
My God.

13:56.937 --> 13:59.204
Peter is responsible for
killing everyone on Earth.

13:59.206 --> 14:02.106
But how could a guy like that
cause all this destruction?

14:02.108 --> 14:04.309
Well, he's clearly
not just a guy.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.311
He's some kind of
omnipotent alien,

14:06.313 --> 14:08.112
with powers we can
only guess at.

14:08.114 --> 14:10.181
Look at him--
watching, learning...

14:10.183 --> 14:12.016
absorbing.

14:12.018 --> 14:14.752
This janitor's in love
with this redheaded ashtray.

14:18.157 --> 14:19.524
But why didn't
he kill us?

14:19.526 --> 14:21.793
I don't know, maybe...
maybe he needs us.

14:21.795 --> 14:23.194
Maybe we're important.

14:23.196 --> 14:25.997
I mean, I do have all these
profound ideas and thoughts.

14:25.999 --> 14:27.498
Maybe I was a deep
thinker of some kind.

14:27.500 --> 14:28.666
Deep thinker?

14:28.668 --> 14:29.834
I spent the whole morning

14:29.836 --> 14:31.469
trying to teach you
one simple thing.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.338
Give me paw.

14:33.340 --> 14:35.073
Paw?

14:35.075 --> 14:37.275
Good.
Other pa.

14:37.277 --> 14:39.277
No. Other paw.

14:39.279 --> 14:40.979
No!
We practiced!

14:40.981 --> 14:42.580
You're gonna make me look bad
in front of the other guys.

14:42.582 --> 14:44.515
Other paw!

14:45.684 --> 14:46.818
Finally!

14:46.820 --> 14:48.119
You know, this
actually reminds me

14:48.121 --> 14:49.187
of a quote by Milton...

14:49.189 --> 14:51.122
Shut the (bleep) up.

14:51.124 --> 14:52.824
Well, what are we gonna do?

14:52.826 --> 14:54.792
What are we
gonna do about what?
(all gasp)

14:54.794 --> 14:56.127
Oh, about the...

14:56.129 --> 14:58.296
The, uh, th-th-the pie!

14:58.298 --> 15:00.365
The pie we're all
gonna make for you for...

15:00.367 --> 15:02.133
being such a great guy.

15:02.135 --> 15:04.302
Aw, my God,
that sounds awesome.

15:04.304 --> 15:05.870
I would kill everyone
in the world

15:05.872 --> 15:08.239
and leave three survivors
for a piece of pie right now.

15:08.241 --> 15:11.209
(nervous laughing)

15:12.678 --> 15:14.245
Guys, really, what
are we gonna do?

15:14.247 --> 15:15.446
Well, it seems obvious.

15:15.448 --> 15:18.249
We gotta find a way
to kill him before he kills us.

15:18.251 --> 15:21.352
How about we just get
the hell out of here?

15:21.354 --> 15:23.154
Are you kidding me?
He'd catch us.

15:23.156 --> 15:25.690
If this guy's an alien,
I bet he can fly.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.992
He can probably
hear us right now.

15:27.994 --> 15:29.127
He's probably got a laser beam

15:29.129 --> 15:30.795
that can shoot us
through the walls.

15:30.797 --> 15:31.963
(screaming)

15:31.965 --> 15:33.498
He can't hit us
if we keep moving!

15:33.500 --> 15:35.633
Can you... Can you not...
Can you...

15:35.635 --> 15:37.802
I just took a bunch of
random stuff I found

15:37.804 --> 15:39.370
in my medicine cabinet,
and you're really

15:39.372 --> 15:40.571
freaking me out
right now.

15:40.573 --> 15:42.340
Okay, maybe he doesn't
have a laser.

15:42.342 --> 15:45.743
But listen, if we're gonna kill
him, we gotta find some guns.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.512
Okay, well, let's go.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.514
Not all of us. Somebody's
gotta go over there

15:49.516 --> 15:52.183
and keep an eye on him, make
sure he doesn't go anywhere.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.184
Oh, come on.
Why me?

15:53.186 --> 15:55.186
'Cause I'm your owner
and I said so.

15:55.188 --> 15:56.354
But I don't want to.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.022
All right, then,
you asked for it!

15:58.958 --> 16:00.124
What, what is that?

16:00.126 --> 16:01.759
I found it
in my night table.

16:01.761 --> 16:04.128
I thought it was a dog whistle,
but now I'm thinking

16:04.130 --> 16:06.764
it's something you jam in your
urethra to make you last longer.

16:11.370 --> 16:13.371
Man, I wonder if I'm one
of those secret assassins

16:13.373 --> 16:14.672
who doesn't even know it,

16:14.674 --> 16:16.507
but I'm a highly trained
killing machine.

16:16.509 --> 16:18.843
Well, I could test that
by attacking you.

16:18.845 --> 16:20.311
If you repel my attack,

16:20.313 --> 16:21.813
maybe that means
you're a secret assassin.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.481
Good idea.

16:24.783 --> 16:28.252
I don't, I don't think
I'm a secret assassin.

16:28.587 --> 16:31.255
(knocking)
Hey, uh...

16:31.257 --> 16:33.157
knock, knock,
a-anybody home?

16:33.159 --> 16:34.525
Oh, hey, bu.
Come on i,

16:34.527 --> 16:36.194
I could use some company.

16:36.196 --> 16:37.695
Um, okay.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.597
Hey, I know we're the only
people on Earth and all,

16:39.599 --> 16:41.099
but what's h
all these Mes

16:41.101 --> 16:42.767
coming hee
to steal our?

16:42.769 --> 16:44.302
Hey, what are you
doin' down there?

16:44.304 --> 16:46.137
Come on, sit up on
the couch with me.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.972
Are you sure?

16:47.974 --> 16:50.608
Mr. Quagmire says dogs aren't
allowed on the furniture.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.076
I don't ce
about that s.

16:52.078 --> 16:54.278
Besides, you look like
you got a clean bum.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.647
It is pretty clean.
I just cleaned it.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.483
Ha. Bums are funny.

16:58.485 --> 17:00.284
(chuckles)
They are kinda funny.

17:00.286 --> 17:02.153
We all got one.
We all got one!

17:02.155 --> 17:04.322
I was just gonna say that!
Isn't-isn't that weird?

17:04.324 --> 17:05.857
(chuckles)
Everybody's got a !

17:05.859 --> 17:07.592
(both laughing)

17:07.594 --> 17:09.327
Mine's even got a secret
compartment in it

17:09.329 --> 17:10.328
where you can store stuff.

17:10.330 --> 17:11.596
Hey, you want a pretzel?

17:11.598 --> 17:12.864
I'm okay.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.966
You know, you ever think
if we could all just

17:14.968 --> 17:17.301
spend more time celebrating our
similarities instead of just

17:17.303 --> 17:18.936
standing on our differences,
the universe

17:18.938 --> 17:20.304
would be a much better place?

17:20.306 --> 17:22.140
Not really.
But that bum thing,

17:22.142 --> 17:23.441
you're-you're on
to something there.

17:23.443 --> 17:24.809
Y-You're, uh...

17:24.811 --> 17:27.345
you're some kind of deep
thinker, aren't you?

17:30.115 --> 17:31.249
(tires screech)

17:32.117 --> 17:33.418
Where you goin'?

17:33.420 --> 17:34.952
I-I think your...

17:34.954 --> 17:36.454
your pie might be
about ready.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.356
Hey, we're gonna share
that pie, buddy,

17:38.358 --> 17:40.858
'cause, you know,
there's no "I" in "pie."

17:40.860 --> 17:42.293
Except for the "I."

17:42.295 --> 17:44.362
But enough about
numbers. You go.

17:46.432 --> 17:48.533
So, we ready
to do this?

17:48.535 --> 17:50.134
You guys, I'm
not sure that

17:50.136 --> 17:51.469
Peter's the guy
we think he is.

17:51.471 --> 17:54.305
He seems harmless and
actually kinda nice.

17:54.307 --> 17:55.740
Oh, my God.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.008
You slept with him!

17:57.010 --> 17:58.276
What? No, no.

17:58.278 --> 18:00.311
We were just watching TV,
but listen,

18:00.313 --> 18:02.914
you've got to believe me, he's
not capable of hurting anyone.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.816
Clearly he's
controlling your mind

18:04.818 --> 18:06.784
with his superior
alien brain.

18:06.786 --> 18:09.320
PETER:
Ah, don't let 'em get
you down, Paul Blart.

18:09.322 --> 18:10.755
Your life has dignity.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.824
(laughs)
And comedy!

18:12.826 --> 18:14.659
Oh, heavens!

18:14.661 --> 18:16.661
Look, there's pretty solid
evidence that this guy

18:16.663 --> 18:18.329
is responsible
for the elimination of

18:18.331 --> 18:21.799
the entire human race,
and we need to take him out.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.301
Okay, okay, you're right.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.203
But he trusts me, so

18:25.205 --> 18:26.771
you guys wait here,

18:26.773 --> 18:28.206
and I'll go lure him out.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.846
I have a lot of
dirty stuff in my house.

18:34.848 --> 18:36.747
Wait, e
hell's ?

18:39.151 --> 18:41.419
He's supposed to be
luring Peter out here.

18:41.421 --> 18:42.954
He's not doing
anything like that.

18:42.956 --> 18:44.155
He's warning him!

18:44.157 --> 18:45.289
They think I'm an alien?!

18:45.291 --> 18:47.125
Yes, and you have to get
out of here right away!

18:47.127 --> 18:49.160
But you're-you're
Quagmire's dog.

18:49.162 --> 18:51.162
Why would you be
helping me instead of him?

18:51.164 --> 18:52.263
Because...

18:52.265 --> 18:54.465
I-I don't...
I don't know why.

18:54.467 --> 18:55.600
I-I can't explain it.

18:55.602 --> 18:56.634
I-I just...

18:56.636 --> 18:59.237
I feel lie
you're my fr.

18:59.239 --> 19:00.505
(sighs)
You wouldn't unders.

19:00.507 --> 19:03.307
No, I think I kinda do.

19:05.511 --> 19:07.311
Come on, buddy.
Let's go!

19:11.450 --> 19:14.152
I knew I couldn't trust you,
you filthy mongrel.

19:14.154 --> 19:16.087
Guys, he didn't
do it, I swear.

19:16.089 --> 19:17.421
Get out of the way, dog.

19:18.991 --> 19:21.292
(shouts)
Please! I didn't do anything!

19:21.294 --> 19:23.494
When you've been a stripper
as long as I have,

19:23.496 --> 19:25.796
you know when you've
met a bad egg.

19:25.798 --> 19:27.498
And you're a bad egg.

19:42.147 --> 19:44.916
No! You bastards!

19:48.320 --> 19:51.522
(sobbing)

19:51.524 --> 19:53.157
(screams)

19:53.159 --> 19:54.959
(beeping)

19:54.961 --> 19:57.161
What the hell...

19:57.163 --> 19:58.663
What's going on?

20:00.299 --> 20:01.199
Stewie?

20:01.201 --> 20:02.967
Well, Brian,
you proved me wrong.

20:02.969 --> 20:04.602
What the hell
are you talking ab?

20:04.604 --> 20:06.103
What, what is all this?

20:06.105 --> 20:08.773
You see, Brian, I conducted
a little experiment.

20:08.775 --> 20:10.508
Remember our
little argument about

20:10.510 --> 20:12.343
whether you and Peter
were actually friends?

20:12.345 --> 20:14.812
Well, I wanted to prove
to you that I was right,

20:14.814 --> 20:17.748
that your friendship was purely
a result of circumstance.

20:17.750 --> 20:21.252
So I created a scenario in which
everyone's memories were erased,

20:21.254 --> 20:23.154
to demonstrate
that you and Peter

20:23.156 --> 20:25.289
would never naturally
associate with one another.

20:25.291 --> 20:26.457
But I was wrong.

20:26.459 --> 20:29.594
It appears you two have
a genuine bond after all.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.095
Wow.

20:31.097 --> 20:34.031
So we really were meant
to be friends.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.266
I guess you were, yes.

20:35.268 --> 20:37.368
So, are they gonna
remember any of this?

20:37.370 --> 20:39.270
No, I'll wipe out
their whole day.

20:39.272 --> 20:40.504
It'll be like
it never happened.

20:40.506 --> 20:41.772
Wow.

20:41.774 --> 20:43.574
Hey, what's going
on over there?

20:44.843 --> 20:48.145
Oh, I wanted to see how
three women would react
in the same situation.

20:48.147 --> 20:49.513
(arguing and screaming)
Stop it!

20:49.515 --> 20:51.115
Ow! Ow!
Let go! Let go!

20:51.117 --> 20:53.951
They've only been in there
for three minutes.

20:53.953 --> 20:56.587
Haven't even tried to figure
out each other's names yet.
