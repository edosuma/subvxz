<i>Meyer Offerman.</i>

00:09.802 --> 00:13.472
My deepest sorrows
about your grandmother.

00:13.472 --> 00:15.057
Oh, God.

00:16.559 --> 00:18.477
<i>Your</i> safta <i>and I were</i>

00:18.477 --> 00:19.562
<i>in the camps together.</i>

00:24.567 --> 00:26.736
If you ever need
anything at all,

00:26.736 --> 00:27.903
you come to me.

00:28.738 --> 00:30.448
<i>Here's what I know.</i>

00:30.448 --> 00:31.866
<i>I know you went looking
for the person</i>

00:31.866 --> 00:33.325
who killed your grandma.

00:33.325 --> 00:35.453
And I think you didn't
do it alone.

00:38.164 --> 00:40.291
She would never
let us pursue anyone

00:40.291 --> 00:41.834
without her verification.

00:41.834 --> 00:44.378
- Pursue who?
- Goddamn

00:44.378 --> 00:46.922
grade A Nazis.

00:47.965 --> 00:49.633
<i>We made a vow.</i>

00:49.633 --> 00:52.136
<i>We would find
these criminals ourselves</i>

00:52.136 --> 00:54.930
and bring God's justice

00:54.930 --> 00:57.057
<i>to their doorstep.</i>

00:57.057 --> 00:59.435
<i>And on the second day,</i>

00:59.435 --> 01:02.062
<i>God created The Hunters,</i>

01:02.062 --> 01:06.776
<i>an elite team
hungry for Nazi slaughter.</i>

01:07.985 --> 01:10.070
Okay, we are live.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.324
Showtime.

01:18.662 --> 01:22.666
This is bigger
than anyone realizes.

01:22.666 --> 01:24.168
<i>They are among us,</i>

01:24.168 --> 01:26.712
<i>and they have plans.</i>

01:30.674 --> 01:32.426
<i>I'm offering you
another path.</i>

01:32.426 --> 01:34.094
<i>To create a task force</i>

01:34.094 --> 01:36.806
to locate and prosecute Nazis
in the U.S.

01:36.806 --> 01:38.182
and abroad.

01:38.182 --> 01:39.809
A Black woman and a Jewish broad

01:39.809 --> 01:42.686
being the stuff
of Nazis' nightmares.

01:42.686 --> 01:45.606
<i>Who's that? The Wolf.</i>

01:45.606 --> 01:47.107
<i>The monster in my story</i>

01:47.107 --> 01:49.735
<i>still haunts me to this day.</i>

01:50.778 --> 01:54.907
I must pray for him...

01:54.907 --> 01:56.492
Before I kill him.

01:56.492 --> 01:58.118
<i>The Wolf.</i>

01:58.118 --> 02:00.037
<i>I fucking found him.</i>

02:05.334 --> 02:06.460
The kaddish.
Before you...

02:06.460 --> 02:07.586
Before you killed him,
you didn't...

02:07.586 --> 02:08.587
you didn't say it.

02:08.587 --> 02:10.089
It's you.

02:10.089 --> 02:12.049
You're Wilhelm Zuchs. You're...

02:13.092 --> 02:14.552
The Wolf.

02:19.056 --> 02:20.474
They're everywhere.

02:24.061 --> 02:26.647
Jews will not replace us.

02:26.647 --> 02:29.066
- Jews will not replace us.
<i>- They're gonna
keep coming.</i>

02:31.485 --> 02:34.822
<i>This is why we have to do
what is wrong.</i>

02:34.822 --> 02:36.115
Agent Morris,

02:36.115 --> 02:38.576
<i>she will hunt us</i>

02:38.576 --> 02:40.327
while we hunt them.

02:40.327 --> 02:42.663
Then perhaps we don't hunt them
in America.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.790
Eastern Europe
loves Lonny Flash.

02:44.790 --> 02:47.042
<i>How is he? The boy?</i>

02:47.042 --> 02:49.712
Well, you'll see for yourself
soon enough.

02:53.924 --> 02:56.635
<i>It begins now.</i>

02:56.635 --> 02:58.762
The Fourth Reich.

03:00.890 --> 03:01.932
Heil Hitler.

03:01.932 --> 03:04.435
Sieg heil.

03:04.435 --> 03:07.605
I'm hungry, Eva, darling.

04:40.823 --> 04:42.866
Those butter sculptures are
to die for.

04:42.866 --> 04:45.661
My wife won last year.

04:45.661 --> 04:50.290
Von Glooten's Day 1971
Butter Sculptor of the Year.

04:50.290 --> 04:52.543
She did a butter Brady Bunch.

04:52.543 --> 04:56.255
Here's the story
of a man named Brady.

04:57.339 --> 04:59.800
Your English

04:59.800 --> 05:01.719
is King's.

05:01.719 --> 05:05.139
Have you lived in Von Glooten
all your life?

05:05.139 --> 05:06.724
All 66 years.

05:06.724 --> 05:08.350
And you?

05:08.350 --> 05:10.811
Oh, no, no.
I'm just here for work.

05:10.811 --> 05:13.355
How long have you
owned this shop?

05:13.355 --> 05:16.608
It's been in my family
for generations.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.738
That's curious because

05:20.738 --> 05:23.198
when I walked in, I saw

05:23.198 --> 05:25.784
on the door frame
an indentation,

05:25.784 --> 05:28.912
the size of a peculiar item

05:28.912 --> 05:30.581
they call a mezuzah.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.001
The Jews,

05:34.001 --> 05:35.878
they put it on their doors

05:35.878 --> 05:37.838
to signify a contract
between them

05:37.838 --> 05:41.967
and their God to-to publicize
to the world that this

05:41.967 --> 05:44.303
is a Jew home or a Jew shop.

05:44.303 --> 05:47.097
Made many people's lives
and jobs much easier.

05:48.766 --> 05:49.975
Are you a Jew, sir?

05:49.975 --> 05:51.977
I'm sorry?

05:51.977 --> 05:54.063
Are you a Jew?

05:56.148 --> 05:57.316
No.

05:59.943 --> 06:01.737
Are...

06:01.737 --> 06:05.032
you a Jew?

06:07.034 --> 06:08.827
I'm not a Jew.

06:08.827 --> 06:11.830
Isn't that what a Jew would say?

06:11.830 --> 06:14.291
Jews can hide
in plain sight.

06:14.291 --> 06:17.252
- Jews are very resourceful.
- Why are you...

06:17.252 --> 06:18.962
It's 1972.

06:18.962 --> 06:23.217
Hmm. Still,
the inquiry is timeless.

06:23.217 --> 06:24.885
I think I'd like you to leave.

06:28.931 --> 06:30.974
I-I mentioned I'm here for work.

06:30.974 --> 06:33.602
Not "here" generally.

06:33.602 --> 06:37.481
Here, specifically, at...

06:37.481 --> 06:41.735
Von Glooten Candy Shop.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.446
At this very counter.

06:44.446 --> 06:46.782
On business.

06:46.782 --> 06:49.368
What... kind of business?

06:49.368 --> 06:51.286
Quality control.

06:53.163 --> 06:57.084
I-I am not
who you think I am.

06:57.084 --> 06:58.836
I swear.

06:58.836 --> 07:02.631
Well, that leaves us
quite the conundrum.

07:02.631 --> 07:04.508
Before the war,
this town was home

07:04.508 --> 07:07.261
to 1,000 Jews.

07:07.261 --> 07:10.722
There were orders
for them to be deported

07:10.722 --> 07:13.517
July 22, 1942,

07:13.517 --> 07:15.144
but they just disappeared.

07:15.144 --> 07:17.062
Poof.

07:17.062 --> 07:20.065
Perhaps... they put on a cross,

07:20.065 --> 07:23.610
took their mezuzahs down,
and became Christians,

07:23.610 --> 07:27.990
but Christians they cannot be.

07:27.990 --> 07:31.618
A rat cannot be a lion, can it?

07:33.078 --> 07:37.499
So, I ask you one final time...

07:37.499 --> 07:39.209
are you a Jew?

07:39.209 --> 07:41.628
- No.
- Then where are they?

07:41.628 --> 07:45.215
It's hard to remem...

07:45.215 --> 07:48.719
Let me help you remember.

07:50.470 --> 07:54.183
The mayor, the-the doctor,

07:54.183 --> 07:56.602
the butcher,
even the schoolteachers,

07:56.602 --> 07:58.854
they rounded the Jews up,
and they...

07:58.854 --> 08:02.482
placed them in the great barn,
and they, um,

08:02.482 --> 08:04.526
locked the doors,

08:04.526 --> 08:07.362
and then they handed them over
to the Nazis,

08:07.362 --> 08:10.866
and the Nazis,
the Nazis put them on railcars

08:10.866 --> 08:13.202
to the concentration camps.

08:13.202 --> 08:14.203
<i>Ja.</i>

08:14.203 --> 08:16.038
<i>Ja, ja.</i>

08:16.038 --> 08:18.332
<i>Ja, ja, ja, ja, ja.</i>

08:18.332 --> 08:19.458
<i>Das ist gut.</i>

08:19.458 --> 08:23.253
Wunderbar, wunderbar.

08:23.253 --> 08:26.256
- So, this was a...
- A Jew's shop.

08:26.256 --> 08:28.133
Hence the mezuzah.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.720
After the Nazis liquidated them,
I took the shop over.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.639
Of course, one can't just

08:33.639 --> 08:35.390
leave jujubes unattended to.

08:35.390 --> 08:37.601
And business, well, has been...

08:37.601 --> 08:39.895
- A-booming? Yes.
- Right.

08:39.895 --> 08:42.356
Well done, well done.

08:42.356 --> 08:44.191
Well, thank you, friend.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.943
It's a pleasure
doing business with you.

08:50.155 --> 08:54.284
Ah, Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.

08:55.452 --> 08:57.663
Jews can hide in plain sight.

08:57.663 --> 09:00.040
Jews are very resourceful.

09:02.834 --> 09:04.753
I'm here because of a ghost

09:04.753 --> 09:07.005
who passed through this town

09:07.005 --> 09:09.633
at war's end.

09:09.633 --> 09:12.886
There's a rail line
a few miles away.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.305
Lets out
in the Port of Genoa, hmm?

09:15.305 --> 09:16.598
Where was he going?

09:16.598 --> 09:18.934
I-I don't know
of what you speak.

09:18.934 --> 09:19.935
I think you do.

09:19.935 --> 09:22.271
Hitler's
trail leads here, friend,

09:22.271 --> 09:23.772
from the Führerbunker

09:23.772 --> 09:25.691
to Munich

09:25.691 --> 09:28.944
to Berghof in Obersalzberg,

09:28.944 --> 09:32.864
across the Alps to here,
Von Glooten.

09:32.864 --> 09:35.367
So, what I need to know is,

09:35.367 --> 09:37.703
where was he going?

09:39.621 --> 09:41.748
Where was the Führer going?

09:48.088 --> 09:50.632
Valle de los Sueños.

09:53.010 --> 09:55.887
Wunderbar.

10:01.393 --> 10:02.644
Why?

10:04.980 --> 10:07.941
Why did God give you thine eyes?

10:07.941 --> 10:09.901
If not to do right

10:09.901 --> 10:12.195
when you saw wrong.

10:13.488 --> 10:15.699
Well, clearly,

10:15.699 --> 10:17.075
you need them not.

12:26.329 --> 12:30.041
Oh, come on, my friends.

12:30.041 --> 12:32.878
You look as if
you've seen a ghost.

12:32.878 --> 12:35.797
What? Is it so difficult
to understand?

12:37.549 --> 12:40.218
How do I explain it to you?
Okay.

12:40.218 --> 12:43.221
There's this old joke

12:43.221 --> 12:45.849
about a man called Schleffler.

12:45.849 --> 12:47.434
He was a faithful man.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.644
More faithful than Sandy Koufax,

12:49.644 --> 12:51.146
believe it or not.

12:51.146 --> 12:52.772
One day Schleffler

12:52.772 --> 12:55.358
is in his house watching TV,

12:55.358 --> 12:57.569
and he sees on the television

12:57.569 --> 12:58.904
there's gonna be a storm.

12:58.904 --> 13:01.448
He sees a car go by
with a lieutenant

13:01.448 --> 13:03.783
who cries out to him,
"Schleffler,

13:03.783 --> 13:06.536
come with us. We'll take you
to higher ground."

13:06.536 --> 13:10.123
And Schleffler says, "God
will save me. You go ahead."

13:10.123 --> 13:11.500
Couple of hours go by,

13:11.500 --> 13:14.294
he's now on the second floor.

13:14.294 --> 13:16.922
He's on the second floor
'cause he can't stay down there,

13:16.922 --> 13:19.257
the water is rising.
So, he looks out

13:19.257 --> 13:20.717
the window,

13:20.717 --> 13:23.720
he sees a boat
come by the house.

13:23.720 --> 13:26.264
The boat stops, says,

13:26.264 --> 13:27.682
"Schleffler,

13:27.682 --> 13:31.061
come, we take you to higher
ground." And he says,

13:31.061 --> 13:33.855
"No, don't worry, God...
God will save me.

13:33.855 --> 13:35.148
It's all right."

13:35.148 --> 13:38.318
He looks up and,
miraculously, he sees

13:38.318 --> 13:40.070
a helicopter.

13:40.070 --> 13:41.988
The guy's hanging out
of the helicopter.

13:41.988 --> 13:43.073
He screams down, says,

13:43.073 --> 13:45.242
"Schleffler, you must come.

13:45.242 --> 13:46.993
We take you to higher ground."

13:46.993 --> 13:48.745
Schleffler says, "No.

13:48.745 --> 13:51.831
God will save me.
It's all right, you can go."

13:51.831 --> 13:52.916
So he dies.

13:52.916 --> 13:55.669
He dies. He's dead.

13:55.669 --> 13:59.589
Now he goes to Heaven
and he sees God.

13:59.589 --> 14:01.258
Cries to him,

14:01.258 --> 14:03.009
"God,

14:03.009 --> 14:05.095
I had such faith in you.

14:05.095 --> 14:09.349
How could you just leave me
there in the storm to die?"

14:09.349 --> 14:11.226
God turns to him. "Schleffler,"

14:11.226 --> 14:13.019
he says,

14:13.019 --> 14:16.314
"fuck you want from me?"

14:16.314 --> 14:20.569
"I sent you a car."

14:20.569 --> 14:24.281
"I sent you a boat.

14:24.281 --> 14:25.490
I sent you

14:25.490 --> 14:27.534
a fucking helicopter.

14:27.534 --> 14:30.287
Schleffler,

14:30.287 --> 14:32.080
you're a schmuck."

14:33.623 --> 14:35.667
Do you understand?

14:35.667 --> 14:39.045
We misread all the time,
and that's what I'm saying.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.505
Waiter, a drink?

14:40.505 --> 14:41.506
That's good.

14:41.506 --> 14:43.174
That's funny.

14:55.979 --> 14:57.814
Care
for another drink, sir?

14:57.814 --> 15:00.025
No. It's all right. Thank you.

15:00.025 --> 15:01.610
I'm fine.

15:31.806 --> 15:33.808
Something wrong?

15:39.898 --> 15:41.191
Hmm.

15:45.236 --> 15:46.821
You don't want us to try?

15:46.821 --> 15:49.532
It could change your mind and
probably make you feel better.

15:50.325 --> 15:51.701
Hmm?

15:53.286 --> 15:54.496
No.

16:59.686 --> 17:02.021
- I'll see you
again tomorrow, I trust?
<i>- Oui.</i>

17:26.087 --> 17:27.714
Jonah.

17:54.657 --> 17:56.659
Love, I'm home.

18:04.292 --> 18:07.504
Jesus Christ, Ted Bundy.

18:08.880 --> 18:10.131
What?

18:12.258 --> 18:14.302
I promise I won't call you
Erik Estrada

18:14.302 --> 18:16.054
during sex again.

18:19.891 --> 18:21.810
You are so weird.

18:21.810 --> 18:23.520
You're so weird.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.355
All right. Right, right, okay,

18:25.355 --> 18:27.440
from the man who

18:27.440 --> 18:30.568
bawled watching <i>Bambi.</i>

18:30.568 --> 18:33.988
Everyone cries during <i>Bambi.</i>
You're...

18:33.988 --> 18:37.492
You're a monster.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.496
- I'm so tired.
- Mm.

18:43.873 --> 18:45.667
Well...

18:45.667 --> 18:47.794
that's what happens
when you pull an all-nighter

18:47.794 --> 18:49.712
at the library.

18:57.929 --> 19:00.098
- Rub my arm, then. Mm.
- Oh, no.

19:00.098 --> 19:01.641
- Really?
- Mm.

19:01.641 --> 19:02.892
Okay.

19:02.892 --> 19:06.187
Oh, and no snoring.

19:06.187 --> 19:08.273
I don't want to fail
my psychology exam

19:08.273 --> 19:11.150
because of my fiancé's sinuses.

19:11.150 --> 19:13.403
I mean that
with the utmost affection.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.493
Hey.

19:22.996 --> 19:25.832
I love you.

19:27.709 --> 19:30.211
I love you, Sam.

19:50.815 --> 19:53.026
Sam, I told him
mimetic desire

19:53.026 --> 19:54.694
was the focus of my
clinical research,

19:54.694 --> 19:56.112
and that I wanted to open
my own practice

19:56.112 --> 19:57.655
in London in a few years,

19:57.655 --> 19:59.991
and he said he'd love to have
an extra hand this summer.

19:59.991 --> 20:01.784
Professor Oughourlian
wants you to be his R.A.?

20:01.784 --> 20:03.786
Professor Morsi
did put in a good word.

20:03.786 --> 20:06.247
"She is good for a woman."
Wanker.

20:06.247 --> 20:08.333
Yeah, I'm the fucking best.

20:08.333 --> 20:09.876
Yes, you're the best.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.961
You're the best.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.713
Proud of you.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.632
Ugh.

20:15.632 --> 20:17.717
Oh, um...

20:17.717 --> 20:21.596
my, uh, mum called
at the crack ass of dawn...

20:21.596 --> 20:23.264
- Uh-huh.
- ...whittling on about how

20:23.264 --> 20:24.766
she would be happy

20:24.766 --> 20:27.477
to invite anyone you wanted
to the wedding,

20:27.477 --> 20:28.937
even last minute.

20:28.937 --> 20:30.980
Maybe there's a second cousin
you don't know about.

20:30.980 --> 20:33.066
Or-or one of your friends
from Cleveland?

20:33.066 --> 20:35.068
You're the only person
I need there.

20:35.068 --> 20:36.361
Sam.

20:36.361 --> 20:39.113
Come on, let's-let's keep going.
We're gonna be late.

20:44.911 --> 20:48.414
<i>♪ Looking at the world through
rose-colored glasses ♪</i>

20:48.414 --> 20:50.375
<i>♪ Everything is rosy now...</i>

20:50.375 --> 20:52.919
So, Frank Sinatra
walks over to me

20:52.919 --> 20:55.546
and he says, "Meyer Offerman."

20:55.546 --> 20:56.965
What a voice he had.

20:56.965 --> 20:59.717
I said, "Hello.
Yes, Mr. Sinatra?"

20:59.717 --> 21:01.427
He said, "I have
something for you."

21:01.427 --> 21:07.141
He hands me this envelope
with a blue ribbon around it.

21:07.141 --> 21:11.604
I open the-the letter,
and inside is a check.

21:13.231 --> 21:17.777
$100,000 for the Jewish
Justice League.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.571
And then
he speaks to me

21:20.571 --> 21:23.199
in perfect Yiddish.

21:23.199 --> 21:27.078
<i>"Mit a lefl ken men dem
yam nit oys'shepn."</i>

21:27.078 --> 21:31.207
"You can't empty
the ocean with a spoon."

21:31.207 --> 21:34.210
This goy is giving away

21:34.210 --> 21:36.129
a fortune to the Jews.

21:36.129 --> 21:37.588
How does this happen?

21:37.588 --> 21:40.341
Well, his babysitter was Jewish.

21:40.341 --> 21:42.510
And he loved her.

21:42.510 --> 21:43.970
And there it is.

21:43.970 --> 21:48.391
And I thought,
"I-I hope we are all raised

21:48.391 --> 21:52.270
by the people
the world tells us to hate."

21:52.270 --> 21:53.688
But...

21:53.688 --> 21:55.440
But it-it-it...

22:08.494 --> 22:09.704
You okay?

22:12.874 --> 22:15.793
I-I don't know what happened.
I just felt, uh...

22:15.793 --> 22:19.547
<i>Now ♪</i>

22:19.547 --> 22:20.757
<i>So?</i>

22:20.757 --> 22:23.342
What's on your mind, my friend?

22:25.053 --> 22:28.389
Uh... I'm, uh...

22:28.389 --> 22:31.934
Why the frantic phone call
last night?

22:31.934 --> 22:34.645
I don't know, but...

22:34.645 --> 22:38.900
I guess I'm feeling unstuck,
in a way.

22:38.900 --> 22:40.193
You're feeling guilty.

22:41.611 --> 22:42.904
Yes, you're carrying the guilt

22:42.904 --> 22:44.572
of what you've done.

22:44.572 --> 22:49.619
<i>Or rather, Meyer,
what you believe you've done.</i>

22:50.995 --> 22:53.623
<i>I remember when you first came
to our synagogue.</i>

22:53.623 --> 22:55.875
<i>You'd only been in the country
a few months.</i>

22:55.875 --> 22:57.585
Do you remember
what the junior rabbi said

22:57.585 --> 22:59.837
to that young man, Meyer?

23:01.756 --> 23:05.218
"One cannot be guilty
of surviving."

23:07.095 --> 23:09.847
<i>There are many
survivors in these pews, Meyer.</i>

23:09.847 --> 23:12.892
<i>Each one struggles
with this guilt,</i>

23:12.892 --> 23:17.522
<i>but survival is a blessing.</i>

23:17.522 --> 23:20.858
You were chosen, Meyer.

23:20.858 --> 23:22.693
- I was chosen.
- Yes.

23:22.693 --> 23:25.905
Hashem chose you.

23:29.617 --> 23:31.994
So...

23:31.994 --> 23:33.496
it's good to see you.

23:33.496 --> 23:35.331
You were very helpful, Rabbi.

23:37.834 --> 23:40.878
Sounds good. Okay.

23:49.637 --> 23:51.389
This just came for you,
Mr. Offerman.

23:51.389 --> 23:54.100
Oh, good. Thank you, Annette.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.810
No, I can't do that.

23:55.810 --> 23:57.311
I can't do it.

23:57.311 --> 23:58.563
All right.

24:21.210 --> 24:23.796
- Annette, where'd you get this?
- Sir?

24:23.796 --> 24:25.756
- Wh-Who gave this to you?
- Uh...

24:25.756 --> 24:28.342
A man, maybe
a messenger service?

24:28.342 --> 24:30.845
From where?
What company sent this?

24:30.845 --> 24:32.305
I didn't speak with him.

24:32.305 --> 24:34.056
Mm-hmm. And so,
what did he look like?

24:34.056 --> 24:35.558
Older.

24:35.558 --> 24:37.268
He was older.

24:37.268 --> 24:38.269
Is everything all right?

24:38.269 --> 24:39.937
What? Yeah, no, it's-it's fine.

24:39.937 --> 24:41.480
I just happen to be feeling
a little under the weather.

24:41.480 --> 24:42.690
That's all.

24:42.690 --> 24:45.109
Tell Paul to bring
the car around.

24:47.236 --> 24:49.363
Uh, Annette,

24:49.363 --> 24:52.909
find out, uh, what service
delivered this letter, yeah?

24:52.909 --> 24:55.369
If that messenger
you saw returns,

24:55.369 --> 24:57.371
call me immediately, huh?

25:01.459 --> 25:03.878
<i>I no longer speak
to my father.</i>

25:03.878 --> 25:06.255
I haven't seen my siblings.

25:06.255 --> 25:07.673
Haven't visited
my mother's grave

25:07.673 --> 25:09.675
nearly as much as she deserves.

25:09.675 --> 25:12.428
And I had a falling out

25:12.428 --> 25:15.973
with Maria, I drove her away.

25:15.973 --> 25:18.935
The woman I loved.

25:18.935 --> 25:23.481
Because I have
been working, Father.

25:25.483 --> 25:27.735
For two long years.

25:31.530 --> 25:34.033
And it has consumed me.

25:40.998 --> 25:42.375
A Black, gay, Catholic woman.

25:42.375 --> 25:43.459
That's probably not
how you thought

25:43.459 --> 25:44.961
you were gonna start
your Tuesday.

25:44.961 --> 25:46.671
My child.

25:48.005 --> 25:51.008
You may begin
with seven Our Fathers.

25:54.470 --> 25:56.472
But on the matter
of your homosexuality,

25:56.472 --> 25:59.308
you must partake
in severe penances.

25:59.308 --> 26:01.477
Father, I think
you're very confused.

26:01.477 --> 26:03.271
Love is no sin.

26:03.271 --> 26:04.522
Not in the eyes of my God.

26:04.522 --> 26:06.649
And I'm not here
for my confession.

26:06.649 --> 26:09.151
I'm here for yours.

26:10.987 --> 26:13.489
Bishop Christian Prentz,
you're under arrest

26:13.489 --> 26:16.158
for violation
of U.S. immigration law

26:16.158 --> 26:18.452
and for your role
as collaborator and murderer

26:18.452 --> 26:20.037
with the Nazi regime

26:20.037 --> 26:22.290
- in Lithuania in 1941.
- No!

26:22.290 --> 26:25.710
When the SS
marched into Vilnius,

26:25.710 --> 26:31.132
my little brother,
he begged this man,

26:31.132 --> 26:33.968
a priest, to save us.

26:33.968 --> 26:37.513
The priest took
my little brother by the neck

26:37.513 --> 26:40.725
and he called out to the SS men,

26:40.725 --> 26:44.020
<i>"Sie haben einen vergessen."</i>

26:44.020 --> 26:45.646
"You forgot one."

26:45.646 --> 26:47.148
I saw

26:47.148 --> 26:52.194
the priest take a-a baby
from its mother's arms.

26:52.194 --> 26:55.072
I thought it was to rescue it.

26:55.072 --> 26:59.118
Instead, he killed that child.

26:59.118 --> 27:02.788
When I close my eyes at night,
that is all I see.

27:02.788 --> 27:06.167
That is all I ever see now.

27:10.629 --> 27:13.424
You failed to prove that he
violated U.S. immigration law.

27:13.424 --> 27:15.092
So then we extradite him
to Lithuania.

27:15.092 --> 27:19.055
The Lithuanian government will
deny any extradition request.

27:19.055 --> 27:21.682
- We have to try him,
Your Honor.
- The case is a reach.

27:21.682 --> 27:24.226
You failed to prove
that Father Balkus

27:24.226 --> 27:26.771
changed his identity
to Bishop Prentz.

27:26.771 --> 27:28.356
The survivors identified him.

27:28.356 --> 27:30.941
That was 30 years ago,
Agent Morris.

27:30.941 --> 27:32.943
Trauma affects memory.

27:32.943 --> 27:35.571
Prentz is a beacon
in the community.

27:35.571 --> 27:37.740
A bishop in the Catholic Church.

27:37.740 --> 27:40.743
This isn't some autoworker
from Ohio.

27:40.743 --> 27:44.955
Two years we have spent
looking for him.

27:44.955 --> 27:47.875
Speaking to eyewitnesses.
Visiting gravesites.

27:47.875 --> 27:52.046
Subsisting
on fucking goulash. He...

27:52.046 --> 27:55.466
Your Honor, he killed a child
with his own hands.

28:00.221 --> 28:03.140
Bishop Prentz is Father Balkus.

28:03.140 --> 28:06.060
And you-you want to do nothing?

28:06.060 --> 28:09.355
In my courtroom, I am bound
not by what is right

28:09.355 --> 28:11.065
but by what is legal.

28:11.065 --> 28:13.484
Is the law fair?

28:13.484 --> 28:15.653
My feelings are immaterial.

28:15.653 --> 28:19.156
You want to deliver justice?

28:19.156 --> 28:21.909
You should've brought me
a better case.

28:45.766 --> 28:46.892
You fell asleep...

28:49.186 --> 28:51.188
How long was I out?

28:51.188 --> 28:52.273
Twenty minutes...

29:13.878 --> 29:17.047
[moaning] Oh, yeah.

29:36.734 --> 29:40.488
Oh, fuck! Oh!

30:01.050 --> 30:03.344
Don't say a word.

30:05.262 --> 30:07.056
Hello, Biff.

30:12.728 --> 30:14.063
Put it on.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.862
We have about two minutes
before they interrupt.

30:23.864 --> 30:26.450
I have waited
over a year for this.

30:27.701 --> 30:29.411
I learned that ever since
you were stationed here,

30:29.411 --> 30:31.288
you come back once a year
to get your fix.

30:31.288 --> 30:33.290
Pigs
remember where

30:33.290 --> 30:36.293
the most delicious
truffles grow.

30:36.293 --> 30:39.213
Where are your friends?

30:41.215 --> 30:44.218
You broke up the band, Yoko?

30:45.511 --> 30:48.722
Was it because of what
happened in Spain?

30:50.224 --> 30:52.851
I heard about what you did.

30:53.894 --> 30:55.938
Look what he did to you.

30:55.938 --> 30:57.731
Meyer.

30:59.024 --> 31:00.943
Look what he turned you into.

31:00.943 --> 31:02.695
- Time's up.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

31:02.695 --> 31:05.823
Wait, wait, wait.
You don't want to kill me.

31:05.823 --> 31:07.116
- Believe me.
- Why not?

31:07.116 --> 31:10.536
Because I-I-I can
give you something.

31:10.536 --> 31:12.871
Someone.
Someone far bigger than me.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.665
Eh, you're enough.

31:14.665 --> 31:16.250
And after you I'm done.

31:16.250 --> 31:20.296
The biggest prize
you could imagine.

31:20.296 --> 31:21.964
Adolf Hitler.

31:25.634 --> 31:28.470
- We're out of time.
- You really think

31:28.470 --> 31:31.140
he committed suicide
in a bunker in '45?

31:31.140 --> 31:33.475
And that his body
was burned by the Russians

31:33.475 --> 31:35.102
and his bones never recovered?

31:35.102 --> 31:36.937
That's what you believe?

31:36.937 --> 31:38.772
You don't think
Stalin would have made

31:38.772 --> 31:40.691
a piñata out of his hide

31:40.691 --> 31:44.945
and strung his corpse up in
the Red Square for all to see?

31:44.945 --> 31:48.449
Don't take my word for it.
Believe for your own eyes.

31:48.449 --> 31:51.327
You saw her. The Colonel.

31:51.327 --> 31:54.288
And she was part
of that fairy tale.

31:54.288 --> 31:57.333
Him and her in the bunker.

31:57.333 --> 31:58.834
The Colonel?

31:58.834 --> 32:01.253
Oh.

32:01.253 --> 32:05.090
You didn't know?

32:05.090 --> 32:07.468
Eva Braun.

32:07.468 --> 32:10.346
All those years ago, <i>Die Spinne</i>

32:10.346 --> 32:13.557
ushered them
through the ratlines.

32:13.557 --> 32:17.269
Hitler, Eva, Goebbels, Mengele.

32:17.269 --> 32:21.440
Berlin to the Alps to Genoa
to safe haven.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.734
All roads lead through Genoa.

32:25.986 --> 32:29.657
What, you didn't think
they'd have an escape plan?

32:38.248 --> 32:40.000
Where?

32:42.586 --> 32:45.089
Valle de los Sueños.

32:47.049 --> 32:49.426
If he was even alive,
why would you give him up?

32:49.426 --> 32:52.971
Uh, you think
I'm a man of honor?

32:52.971 --> 32:54.390
I'm a cockroach.

32:54.390 --> 32:56.725
I can help you find him.

32:56.725 --> 32:58.560
I can take you to him.

32:58.560 --> 33:01.021
You'll never find him
on your own.

33:02.064 --> 33:04.233
Let me live,

33:04.233 --> 33:07.986
and I will bring you
to Adolf Hitler,

33:07.986 --> 33:09.655
in flesh and blood.

33:09.655 --> 33:11.031
What the hell is going on here?

33:27.464 --> 33:28.716
I wasn't here.

33:49.528 --> 33:52.573
"To Estelle,

33:52.573 --> 33:57.244
Hugs and kvetches,

33:57.244 --> 33:58.746
Danny Rohr."

34:03.417 --> 34:05.085
Who is getting my autograph?

34:05.085 --> 34:07.629
Could you
make it out to Millie?

34:08.714 --> 34:10.841
How about, "To Millie,

34:10.841 --> 34:13.886
Will send you
your 50% cut of profits

34:13.886 --> 34:16.346
from the book this afternoon.

34:16.346 --> 34:19.308
Indebted to you forever, Danny."

34:20.684 --> 34:22.394
<i>The past
two years alone,</i>

34:22.394 --> 34:25.189
<i>Holocaust</i> drops on NBC,
Chuck Allen writes his exposé,

34:25.189 --> 34:27.483
survivors speak out worldwide.

34:27.483 --> 34:29.526
It's fantastic.

34:29.526 --> 34:33.822
So I wrote a book,
called it a conspiracy thriller.

34:33.822 --> 34:35.991
Now it's outselling
<i>The World According to Garp.</i>

34:35.991 --> 34:39.369
With FBI Agent "Melanie Moritz."

34:39.369 --> 34:40.662
Your name would never clear.

34:40.662 --> 34:42.289
Oh.

34:42.289 --> 34:46.376
My, uh, agent says Mike Nichols
wants to option the rights.

34:46.376 --> 34:49.087
Well, I don't know who that is,
but if you cast me

34:49.087 --> 34:51.632
as this Farrah Fawcett
white girl, I'm-a destroy you.

34:51.632 --> 34:53.717
I believe you.

34:55.260 --> 34:58.847
I, uh, I heard about
Bishop Prentz.

35:00.891 --> 35:02.643
Yeah.

35:02.643 --> 35:05.646
That's two years of my life.

35:05.646 --> 35:08.982
And come this December,
he's gonna be back in Pasadena

35:08.982 --> 35:11.652
putting on a Christmas pageant,
free man.

35:13.987 --> 35:16.240
You just come here
to commiserate, or...?

35:21.453 --> 35:23.789
- Have you found them yet?
- Who?

35:23.789 --> 35:26.166
- The Hunters.
- The Hunters?

35:26.166 --> 35:28.502
- I mean, why did they...
- Stop?

35:28.502 --> 35:31.547
Disappear?
I'm not the CIA, Millie.

35:31.547 --> 35:34.675
All I know is, no more dead
Nazis have been popping up.

35:34.675 --> 35:38.053
The Hunters seem to be gone.

35:38.053 --> 35:40.597
Maybe they caught 'em all
and retired,

35:40.597 --> 35:42.474
maybe they broke up.

35:42.474 --> 35:44.768
Or maybe...

35:44.768 --> 35:46.603
maybe something worse.

35:46.603 --> 35:48.689
Maybe some of them are dead.

35:50.524 --> 35:54.319
Why? Why do you want to know?

36:11.336 --> 36:14.047
<i>Hi, you've reached
Ruth and Jonah.</i>

36:14.047 --> 36:16.300
<i>Please leave a message
after the beep.</i>

36:16.300 --> 36:18.510
Hey.

36:18.510 --> 36:20.304
It's me.

36:20.304 --> 36:22.764
Uh...

36:22.764 --> 36:25.893
It's nice to hear her voice.

36:25.893 --> 36:27.519
Didn't even know her
and I like hearing

36:27.519 --> 36:29.605
her voice for some reason.

36:29.605 --> 36:32.274
It makes me wish I had
my mom's voice somewhere.

36:34.318 --> 36:37.362
I should've called you.

36:37.362 --> 36:39.072
Uh...

36:41.074 --> 36:44.661
I just got busy and I,
uh, somehow...

36:44.661 --> 36:48.332
...let nearly two years
go by without, uh...

36:49.875 --> 36:51.710
...checking on you.

36:55.881 --> 36:58.467
Or maybe, uh...

37:00.469 --> 37:02.888
Maybe I was calling
to ask you something else.

37:04.890 --> 37:06.308
Ask...

37:08.435 --> 37:10.562
Ask if you're still...

37:10.562 --> 37:14.358
<i>To continue,
please deposit 25 cents.</i>

37:18.111 --> 37:20.280
<i>Earlier today,
charges were dropped</i>

37:20.280 --> 37:22.115
<i>against Bishop Prentz
of Pasadena, who was</i>

37:22.115 --> 37:24.868
<i>mistakenly believed to be
Father Balkus of Lithuania.</i>

37:24.868 --> 37:27.204
<i>In a prepared statement,
he thanked his supporters</i>

37:27.204 --> 37:28.705
<i>and said his faith
helped guide him</i>

37:28.705 --> 37:30.457
<i>through this personal crisis,</i>

37:30.457 --> 37:33.502
<i>and he believes God will bring
the real sinners to justice.</i>

37:33.502 --> 37:35.253
<i>On the international front...</i>

37:43.929 --> 37:46.348
Here we are,
Mr. Offerman.

37:46.348 --> 37:48.350
Finally home.

37:50.352 --> 37:51.895
- Go around the block.
- Sir?

37:51.895 --> 37:54.106
Go around the block. Come on.

38:03.115 --> 38:06.868
Who else could know?

39:01.089 --> 39:03.508
<i>Hallo?</i>

39:05.010 --> 39:06.219
<i>Hallo?</i>

39:06.219 --> 39:09.222
Y-Yeah...

39:09.222 --> 39:10.724
Frau Zuchs?

39:10.724 --> 39:12.517
Yes?

39:12.517 --> 39:14.102
Gertrude Zuchs?

39:14.102 --> 39:17.022
Gertrude Konner.
Zuchs was my family name.

39:17.022 --> 39:18.148
Can I help you with something?

39:20.233 --> 39:23.904
I'm from
the Government census board.

39:23.904 --> 39:26.865
I'm looking for Wilhelm Zuchs.

39:26.865 --> 39:28.033
Your brother.

39:29.659 --> 39:31.703
My brother's dead.

39:31.703 --> 39:34.790
He died 35 years ago.

39:37.417 --> 39:40.253
Did anyone call here recently
about him?

39:40.253 --> 39:42.380
About Wilhelm?

39:42.380 --> 39:43.715
No.

39:43.715 --> 39:46.760
Why would anyone call
about my brother?

39:46.760 --> 39:49.679
Sometimes we get
our wires crossed.

39:49.679 --> 39:51.431
Just... confirming.

39:51.431 --> 39:53.308
Well, thank you for your time.

40:12.536 --> 40:14.454
Jesus Christ, what's wrong?

40:16.373 --> 40:18.500
- Sam.
- It's okay.

40:20.293 --> 40:21.795
It's okay.

40:26.133 --> 40:27.884
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

40:27.884 --> 40:30.387
<i>Oh, shit. Claude's here.</i>

40:30.387 --> 40:33.014
- He's always...
- He is not that bad.

40:33.014 --> 40:34.933
No, he is. He really is.

40:36.351 --> 40:38.019
Oh...

40:43.233 --> 40:44.943
Oh.

40:44.943 --> 40:47.571
Uh, yeah, I forgot to mention,

40:47.571 --> 40:48.989
Professor Morél wants me to go

40:48.989 --> 40:50.532
on another research trip
with him.

40:50.532 --> 40:53.160
- Oh. To where?
- Israel.

40:53.160 --> 40:55.287
He says it's about
two weeks or so.

40:55.287 --> 40:57.164
- Two weeks?
- Yeah.

40:57.164 --> 41:01.585
He says I'll have enough
to finally finish my thesis.

41:01.585 --> 41:05.338
It can finally be over.

41:05.338 --> 41:07.424
Hmm. Well...

41:08.967 --> 41:11.303
...hurry back.

41:13.305 --> 41:17.475
<i>♪ La, la, la-la-la-la,
la, la-la-la-la...</i>

41:17.475 --> 41:19.603
- Bonjour.
- Hello.

41:19.603 --> 41:21.479
You guys just had sex,
didn't you two?

41:21.479 --> 41:23.648
Shut up, Claude.

41:23.648 --> 41:25.567
Well, they're becoming French.
Let's get drunk, huh?

41:25.567 --> 41:26.985
This one song...

41:30.280 --> 41:32.199
He sings, too, huh?

41:41.082 --> 41:42.459
Who's Meyer?

41:43.501 --> 41:45.003
What?

41:46.463 --> 41:50.008
You screamed his name
in your sleep.

41:50.008 --> 41:51.718
"Meyer."

41:53.720 --> 41:55.972
I don't know a Meyer.

42:48.275 --> 42:49.985
Well, I got you.

42:53.655 --> 42:55.156
If you're going to be
following me about

42:55.156 --> 42:58.201
and leaving me
these little love notes,

42:58.201 --> 43:00.912
we may as well
get a drink first?

43:00.912 --> 43:04.040
There's a bar there. We talk.

43:05.083 --> 43:06.710
Do you speak English?

43:06.710 --> 43:07.919
<i>Ja.</i>

43:07.919 --> 43:09.462
Good.

43:09.462 --> 43:11.423
There we are.

43:15.802 --> 43:18.888
Come, sit. It's all right.

43:19.973 --> 43:21.599
Oh, uh...

43:21.599 --> 43:25.812
You might want to put
that knife away, brother. Huh?

43:28.940 --> 43:30.608
Good man.

43:31.651 --> 43:33.695
Now, if you wanted

43:33.695 --> 43:37.449
an audience with me,
all you had to do was ask.

43:40.452 --> 43:43.038
I know who you are.

43:43.038 --> 43:46.750
Of course. You are a wolf.

43:46.750 --> 43:51.546
And a wolf can sniff out
a fellow wolf from miles away.

43:51.546 --> 43:54.591
Even if it lives
in sheep's clothing.

43:54.591 --> 43:56.634
Huh? Mm.

43:57.677 --> 43:59.304
I remember you.

43:59.304 --> 44:02.015
Yeah. C-Block.

44:02.015 --> 44:04.809
Hammerschmidt.

44:04.809 --> 44:06.644
Fritz.

44:06.644 --> 44:08.772
I never forget a face.

44:08.772 --> 44:11.649
But now look at you.
What are you doing?

44:11.649 --> 44:15.403
This is no way for
a <i>Hauptsturmführer</i> to present.

44:15.403 --> 44:18.073
This is not who you are.

44:19.449 --> 44:21.785
It's been so hard.

44:24.412 --> 44:26.456
For so many years...

44:27.540 --> 44:29.918
...living in the shadows.

44:31.294 --> 44:33.797
Frondheim...

44:33.797 --> 44:36.800
ushered so many of us
through the ratlines,

44:36.800 --> 44:40.136
and then just left us here...

44:40.136 --> 44:42.555
...to fend for ourselves.

44:42.555 --> 44:44.557
That is why I've come to you.

44:44.557 --> 44:46.017
I'm glad you did,

44:46.017 --> 44:49.062
but don't come to me
the way you did.

44:49.062 --> 44:52.315
Levying threats.
Sneaking around.

44:52.315 --> 44:56.403
I'm just glad
you found me, but, uh...

44:58.613 --> 45:00.740
...how did you find me?

45:00.740 --> 45:04.619
If you can find me,
how about Wiesenthal?

45:04.619 --> 45:06.204
- How about the Mossad?
- Uh, Frondheim

45:06.204 --> 45:08.915
tracked me down.

45:08.915 --> 45:11.543
He brought me to his home
in Connecticut,

45:11.543 --> 45:14.587
told me we could make quite
a racket if we blackmailed

45:14.587 --> 45:17.382
some of the men
he had helped to disappear.

45:17.382 --> 45:22.470
He had files, all the aliases
of all the men he had helped.

45:22.470 --> 45:28.309
He said some years ago,
he... he saw your name

45:28.309 --> 45:30.520
in the newspaper.

45:30.520 --> 45:33.022
He saw the empire you had built.

45:35.024 --> 45:36.943
He wanted his bit.

45:36.943 --> 45:39.446
Oh, Herr Frondheim.

45:41.448 --> 45:43.700
Connecticut, huh?

45:43.700 --> 45:46.286
Does he live
in a big house, Fritz?

45:46.286 --> 45:49.164
Yeah. I would say so.

45:49.164 --> 45:51.833
He's not sharing his purse
but sending you

45:51.833 --> 45:54.335
to go out and reckon with me.

45:54.335 --> 45:56.588
I'm so sorry, Wilhelm.

45:56.588 --> 45:58.590
Well, don't be sorry. For what?

45:58.590 --> 46:01.426
It's Frondheim
who's the serpent.

46:01.426 --> 46:04.220
He's the one pushing you,

46:04.220 --> 46:06.473
poisoning brother
against brother.

46:07.974 --> 46:11.352
I take you back to my house.

46:11.352 --> 46:13.438
I put a meal in you. Yeah?

46:13.438 --> 46:15.523
Get you cleaned up.

46:15.523 --> 46:19.527
And then,
I'll write you a check.

46:19.527 --> 46:23.156
Get you back on your feet.

46:23.156 --> 46:25.033
- Really?
- Of course.

46:25.033 --> 46:27.410
Finish this.

46:27.410 --> 46:29.329
I don't even know
which way is home,

46:29.329 --> 46:30.997
and I'm not even drunk.

46:30.997 --> 46:32.457
I tell you.

46:32.457 --> 46:35.084
What is it, this... Oh, yes.

46:35.084 --> 46:37.712
There is it. This is the way.

46:37.712 --> 46:41.508
My home is just a few blocks
right down there.

46:41.508 --> 46:45.136
Oh, you know, brother,
it's the strangest thing.

46:45.136 --> 46:46.763
Hmm?

46:46.763 --> 46:50.391
Wolves can smell
each other from miles away.

46:50.391 --> 46:52.227
I don't know how they do it.

46:52.227 --> 46:56.397
Their, what, the fur,
the-the piss,

46:56.397 --> 46:58.191
The blood.

46:58.191 --> 47:00.777
But, you know,
come to think of it,

47:00.777 --> 47:03.780
I cannot smell you at all.

47:39.107 --> 47:40.525
You shouldn't be here.

47:41.734 --> 47:42.944
I know.

47:44.362 --> 47:46.698
If you leave right now,
I won't say anything.

47:46.698 --> 47:49.200
- I swear.
- I can't do that.

47:53.705 --> 47:55.456
You need to admit what you did.

47:57.750 --> 47:59.168
Who you are.

48:03.131 --> 48:05.842
I am not that man.

48:05.842 --> 48:07.468
You are.

48:09.512 --> 48:12.515
Admit who you are.

48:14.851 --> 48:16.060
I can't.

48:22.859 --> 48:25.570
You're gonna have to do this.

48:27.363 --> 48:29.741
You understand me?

48:35.371 --> 48:37.123
- I won't.
- You will.

48:39.667 --> 48:43.129
You are a Christian woman, yes?

48:47.008 --> 48:49.636
He would not
want you to do this.

48:51.429 --> 48:53.598
You are not a killer.

48:53.598 --> 48:55.600
You are a woman of God.

49:26.881 --> 49:30.093
Fuck. Fuck, fuck.

49:38.393 --> 49:41.062
Bishop,
are you okay in there?

50:10.758 --> 50:12.844
Who is it?

50:20.977 --> 50:22.937
Who's there?

50:32.071 --> 50:33.489
Who's there?

50:46.669 --> 50:48.254
You called?

50:48.254 --> 50:50.548
I found something.

52:20.054 --> 52:21.973
I thought pig was tender.

52:23.683 --> 52:26.143
Chew slowly, my Führer.

52:27.186 --> 52:29.730
It's good for the indigestion.

52:31.732 --> 52:32.692
Sit.

52:32.692 --> 52:33.901
Eat.

52:33.901 --> 52:35.069
