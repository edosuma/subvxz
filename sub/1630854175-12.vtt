37:07.626 --> 37:09.828
Shock waves rippled
around the world

37:09.861 --> 37:12.163
as cosmetics mogul
Layla Laughlin was shot

37:12.197 --> 37:14.833
and killed in her Bel Air home
earlier today.

37:14.866 --> 37:17.102
The alleged shooter, her son,
Chance Laughlin,

37:17.135 --> 37:19.971
was arrested by FBI agents
at the scene.

37:20.005 --> 37:23.375
In related news, Laughlin's
new "miracle" cream, de Léon,

37:23.409 --> 37:25.544
is being recalled
after it was determined

37:25.577 --> 37:27.012
that the secret ingredient

37:27.045 --> 37:28.647
that promised
the "fountain of youth"

37:28.680 --> 37:31.049
was, in fact, human blood.

37:31.082 --> 37:33.919
Interviewer:
Where did this blood-infused
cream idea come from?

37:33.952 --> 37:37.055
After we arrested Chance,
we learned that once he took

37:37.088 --> 37:39.190
the reins from his mother,
he became the company's

37:39.224 --> 37:41.727
head scientist in charge
of research and development.

37:41.760 --> 37:45.931
And in an effort to boost sales,
he created the de Léon cream

37:45.964 --> 37:47.433
using Dante's
golden blood.

37:47.466 --> 37:50.436
And at that point, well,
Layla was just a figurehead.

37:50.469 --> 37:52.971
She had no knowledge
of her son's misdeeds.

37:53.004 --> 37:55.974
Chance had sunk, you know,
millions into R&D,

the anti-aging antigens from --

37:58.510 --> 38:00.178

No, no, not when I found out
he has Golden Blood.

38:18.263 --> 38:21.232

with Rhnull blood

38:21.266 --> 38:23.134

38:23.168 --> 38:25.604
Hospitals all around the world
would call on him to donate.

38:25.637 --> 38:28.440
Chance knew Dante
would never agree to donate

38:28.474 --> 38:30.008
for cosmetics, so...

38:30.041 --> 38:32.344
He abducted him
and held him prisoner.

38:32.378 --> 38:35.414
Chance fed him nourishing food
and kept him well-rested.

In order to keep Dante and, most
importantly, his blood healthy.

But Dante's blood was basically
a renewable resource.

38:41.387 --> 38:42.554
Why kill him?

38:42.588 --> 38:46.124
I'd have kept him locked away
indefinitely.

Let's move on.
Mm-hmm.

38:50.929 --> 38:52.664
So what went wrong?
Why did Chance kill him?

38:52.698 --> 38:54.433
It was an accident.

38:54.466 --> 38:56.768
The demand for the de Léon cream
skyrocketed.

38:56.802 --> 38:58.937
And one day Chance took
too much blood,

38:58.970 --> 39:00.872
and Dante had a heart attack
and died.

39:00.906 --> 39:03.174
So you drained him
of every last drop.

39:03.208 --> 39:06.978
I even had to punch holes
in his neck to suck out

39:07.012 --> 39:09.581

from his carotid.

to dig a six-foot grave

39:23.695 --> 39:25.797
I just don't have that kind
of upper-body strength.

39:25.831 --> 39:29.234
The guy was an unrepentant
megalomaniac.

39:29.267 --> 39:31.937
And it made me realize
that if Dante died,

39:31.970 --> 39:35.006
Chance would need a new victim
with the golden blood
