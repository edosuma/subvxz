WEBVTT

00:00.801 --> 00:03.037
Previously on Outsiders...

00:05.173 --> 00:06.340
What's that?

00:06.374 --> 00:08.042
The end of your career.

00:08.076 --> 00:09.210
G'WIN:
We're going on this run.

00:09.243 --> 00:10.344
We're only gonna take back
what's owed us,

00:10.378 --> 00:11.779
water and flour, that's all.

00:11.812 --> 00:13.214
-What are you doing here?
-They dropped poison from

00:13.247 --> 00:14.648
the air above onto our fields.

00:14.682 --> 00:16.617
-Yeah, Houghton, go ahead.
-DISPATCH: Armed robbery

00:16.650 --> 00:18.452
-in progress.
-It's your people, isn't it?

00:18.486 --> 00:19.720
Put your hands up, Farrells.

00:20.821 --> 00:23.257
(gunshots)

00:23.291 --> 00:25.159
(grunts)

00:25.193 --> 00:26.327
SALLY-ANN: Was counting
the money from the fight

00:26.360 --> 00:27.795
last night and
something ain't right.

00:27.828 --> 00:30.664
Butch is out, and I'm handling
Hasil's stuff from now on.

00:30.698 --> 00:32.300
Saw him today,
man who killed Breece.

00:32.333 --> 00:34.302
You're under arrest for
the murder of Breece Dobbs.

00:34.335 --> 00:35.569
Could've shot him dead
right there.

00:35.603 --> 00:38.406
-But you didn't.
-Drop your gun, Wade!

00:38.439 --> 00:40.074
BIG FOSTER:
I'm walking away now, Sheriff.

00:40.108 --> 00:42.143
(engine revs)

00:42.176 --> 00:44.345
MEYERS: Those samples, they're
only gonna prove you wrong.

00:44.378 --> 00:45.713
HAYLIE:
When those results come back,

00:45.746 --> 00:47.448
you're gonna be going to jail.

00:47.481 --> 00:49.483
I tried.

00:49.517 --> 00:50.784
-(phone rings)
-Yeah?

01:30.424 --> 01:33.227
Elon?

01:48.876 --> 01:51.279
(breathing heavily)

02:38.259 --> 02:39.427
Elon!

02:39.460 --> 02:41.462
(engine running,
then sputtering)

02:41.495 --> 02:43.431
(panting)

02:45.533 --> 02:46.867
It's dead.

02:46.900 --> 02:48.702
Looks like we're walking.

02:54.508 --> 02:56.777
(panting)

02:58.779 --> 02:59.947
You all right?

02:59.980 --> 03:01.649
Yeah.
(spits)

03:05.819 --> 03:08.256
We should get moving.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.299
(country blues music playing)

03:20.268 --> 03:23.804
* The dawn is up,
there's fire on the mountain *

03:23.837 --> 03:28.409
* They'll have to answer
for their crooked claim *

03:28.442 --> 03:31.479
* The hollows
they'll surround them *

03:31.512 --> 03:33.981
* And they'll go running back

03:34.014 --> 03:37.217
* To the wretched realm
they came *

03:39.753 --> 03:45.693
* Nor will the dogs
of hell refrain *

03:45.726 --> 03:48.296
* And the land

03:48.329 --> 03:51.765
* Will suffer those who came.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.643
(indistinct conversations)

04:09.082 --> 04:11.018
(helicopter blades whirring)

04:25.633 --> 04:27.501
Now, the ligature marks
on the neck

04:27.535 --> 04:29.069
are consistent
with the, uh, bathrobe

04:29.102 --> 04:31.839
that was removed from the scene.

04:31.872 --> 04:36.644
Petechiae on the forehead and
under the eyelids, congestion.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.812
Her arms and legs are scratched
up pretty good, too,

04:38.846 --> 04:41.649
but, uh, that occurred prior
to the time of death.

04:41.682 --> 04:44.017
It's, uh... it's pretty
straightforward.

04:47.721 --> 04:49.557
She just hung herself
in her hotel bathroom?

04:49.590 --> 04:51.024
Yeah, it looks that way.

04:51.058 --> 04:52.960
I haven't finished
my full exam, but so far,

04:52.993 --> 04:56.430
I see nothing to suggest
anything other than suicide.

04:57.698 --> 04:59.667
I don't get it.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.069
I mean, I saw her two days
before, and she told me

05:02.102 --> 05:03.737
she never felt better.

05:03.771 --> 05:05.939
Yeah, well, I guess, uh,
"never better"

05:05.973 --> 05:09.410
means something different
to everybody, doesn't it?

05:12.613 --> 05:14.882
(sighs)

05:17.951 --> 05:20.120
(Houghton sighs)

05:20.153 --> 05:21.522
Find anything?

05:21.555 --> 05:22.756
Hell of a suicide note.

05:30.030 --> 05:33.467
-HOUGHTON: That's it?
-Yeah.

05:33.501 --> 05:34.868
You find any of those,
like, little Mason jars?

05:34.902 --> 05:36.604
The type of things people
drink shine from?

05:36.637 --> 05:37.905
No, nothing like that.

05:39.139 --> 05:40.874
Got her phone.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.481
-It's got a lock on it?
-Yeah.

05:47.515 --> 05:49.116
(softly):
Yeah. Just go.

05:54.788 --> 05:55.956
MEYERS:
Haylie Grimes' death

05:55.989 --> 05:57.558
was a shock to all of us.

05:57.591 --> 06:00.561
She was as tough and dedicated
as they come.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.730
The situation in Blackburg
was stressful, I'm sure,

06:02.763 --> 06:04.097
but I understand
that she was also

06:04.131 --> 06:05.733
dealing with family issues...

06:05.766 --> 06:08.569
Haylie was a friend, so,
please, cut the bullshit.

06:08.602 --> 06:11.405
WOMAN:
Mr. Meyers, I think I speak for

06:11.439 --> 06:14.107
both Don and the
lieutenant governor when I say

06:14.141 --> 06:15.776
there are some very
real concerns about

06:15.809 --> 06:19.447
how things have unfolded
in Blackburg on your watch.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.114
We got ourselves a goddamn train
wreck down there, huh, Matt?

06:21.148 --> 06:25.553
You know I love you, I know you,
I respect you, but...

06:25.586 --> 06:27.154
gee whiz, I've lost track

06:27.187 --> 06:30.758
of the number of ways that
you've dicked this thing up.

06:30.791 --> 06:33.093
A $2 million fence that
couldn't keep a rabbit out,

06:33.126 --> 06:35.829
thank God we dumped that.

06:35.863 --> 06:38.198
Got a bunch of citizens
scared out of their minds

06:38.231 --> 06:40.468
by some outlaw hillbillies,
running around,

06:40.501 --> 06:42.035
doing whatever they
damn well please

06:42.069 --> 06:44.472
including breaking each other
out of prison,

06:44.505 --> 06:46.540
shooting an off-duty cop.

06:46.574 --> 06:47.975
We're also concerned about the
recent Internet security issues.

06:48.008 --> 06:49.176
SHAW:
Yeah, don't even get me started

06:49.209 --> 06:51.512
on that Internet crap.

06:51.545 --> 06:53.447
Holy Mary, Mother of God.

06:53.481 --> 06:55.483
I mean, all these folks
around here already think

06:55.516 --> 06:56.850
that we're all in bed together,

06:56.884 --> 06:58.452
they don't need to hear
the springs squeaking.

06:58.486 --> 07:00.020
May I speak?

07:00.053 --> 07:04.124
I take full responsibility
for the situation in Blackburg.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.730
And I would like to tender
my resignation,

07:09.763 --> 07:11.231
effective immediately.

07:11.264 --> 07:12.700
What?

07:12.733 --> 07:13.901
You are now free

07:13.934 --> 07:15.869
to send your guard units
up Shay Mountain

07:15.903 --> 07:18.772
and arrest and imprison every
Farrell man, woman and child,

07:18.806 --> 07:20.508
because they've made it clear
they're not going

07:20.541 --> 07:21.909
-without a fight.
-Come on, Matt.

07:21.942 --> 07:23.477
You know as well as I do

07:23.511 --> 07:25.946
how that's gonna go over
in the governor's office

07:25.979 --> 07:27.681
with an election year
coming around the corner.

07:27.715 --> 07:29.483
Yes, I do.

07:29.517 --> 07:31.785
Nobody wants the state of
Kentucky up on that mountain.

07:31.819 --> 07:33.621
Heck, half the county
supports the Farrells,

07:33.654 --> 07:36.490
they think they're the last
free people in America.

07:36.524 --> 07:38.526
I think it's time to request
federal support.

07:38.559 --> 07:40.628
Oh, come on, Matt, damn it,

07:40.661 --> 07:43.631
you know that Washington does
not have a dog in this fight.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.198
Not yet.

07:45.232 --> 07:48.836
But if I am somehow allowed
to continue in my failure,

07:48.869 --> 07:52.973
there is a plan in place that
would force Washington's hand.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.709
-Which is what, exactly?
-Wait, whoa.

07:55.743 --> 07:57.177
Son, you don't want
to ask questions

07:57.210 --> 07:58.779
you might not
want the answer to.

08:00.213 --> 08:01.549
So...

08:02.816 --> 08:05.519
...y-you have a plan.

08:05.553 --> 08:06.787
I do.

08:09.056 --> 08:12.259
PORTER: Eric Steven Thompson,
not Gordon Jerrod, correct?

08:13.794 --> 08:15.195
No?

08:15.228 --> 08:17.030
How about Timothy Aldrich?

08:17.064 --> 08:20.634
Wanted for bombing the offices
of Heartland Energy,

08:20.668 --> 08:23.236
Parmelee, South Dakota,
May 1, 2015?

08:25.639 --> 08:28.241
Killed some poor schmuck,
working overtime

08:28.275 --> 08:29.743
chasing a promotion.

08:29.777 --> 08:31.178
Look, if I'm being charged
with something,

08:31.211 --> 08:33.180
can you at least tell me
what it is?

08:33.213 --> 08:35.215
Yeah, that's not exactly
our line of work.

08:35.248 --> 08:38.251
But by all means,
keep playing dumb.

08:38.285 --> 08:40.888
Because the people who will
charge you for murder,

08:40.921 --> 08:42.322
among other things,

08:42.355 --> 08:43.857
they're only a phone call away.

08:43.891 --> 08:45.859
Or not.

08:45.893 --> 08:47.761
All depends on your willingness
to play ball.

08:52.065 --> 08:53.667
Parmelee was a mistake.

08:53.701 --> 08:55.035
That building was supposed
to be empty.

08:55.068 --> 08:56.870
PORTER:
See? That wasn't so hard.

08:56.904 --> 09:00.140
First step in coming to Jesus
is to admit that you done wrong.

09:04.144 --> 09:05.646
TECH:
It's clean.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.253
What do you want from me?

09:13.286 --> 09:17.190
Making friends seems to be
a talent of yours

09:17.224 --> 09:19.593
and right now
that's very valuable to me,

09:19.627 --> 09:22.996
and to you, as it turns out.

09:23.030 --> 09:25.766
PORTER:
So, Gordo, what do you say?

09:25.799 --> 09:28.368
Want to make some new friends?

09:28.401 --> 09:30.871
*

09:58.766 --> 09:59.900
Hi.

10:03.871 --> 10:06.774
(groans softly)

10:06.807 --> 10:08.308
(gun cocks)

10:10.711 --> 10:12.345
Beautiful day, isn't it?

10:15.015 --> 10:17.184
BIG FOSTER:
Well, well, well, well.

10:17.217 --> 10:20.287
Lookie here.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.290
You are a lost little lamb
indeed, ain't you?

10:23.323 --> 10:26.059
PHIL'UP: No, he's more wolf
than lamb, if you ask me.

10:26.093 --> 10:28.395
Seems he came up
the morning side trails.

10:28.428 --> 10:30.097
Oh.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.033
You're intruding
on Farrell land,

10:33.066 --> 10:35.302
our land.

10:35.335 --> 10:37.270
Now you're not from these parts,
so we'll spare the mistake.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.672
Once.

10:38.706 --> 10:40.373
Oh, I'm not here by mistake.

10:40.407 --> 10:42.142
My name is Gordon Jerrod.

10:42.175 --> 10:45.412
And like you,
I'm no friend of big coal.

10:45.445 --> 10:47.147
In fact, I've been fighting
them for years.

10:47.180 --> 10:48.381
What's your purpose here?

10:48.415 --> 10:49.917
To warn you.

10:49.950 --> 10:51.852
You made yourself heard.

10:51.885 --> 10:54.922
People know what One Planet
is doing up here,

10:54.955 --> 10:57.324
they're poisoning
your food, your water,

10:57.357 --> 10:59.059
and people are angry.

10:59.092 --> 11:01.394
-Oh, well, then good.
-GORDON: Yeah, it would be good,

11:01.428 --> 11:04.031
-but then you shot a cop.
-Oh, that ain't true.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.333
We didn't shoot no one,
especially not no cop.

11:06.366 --> 11:08.902
Besides,
we-we was shot at first.

11:08.936 --> 11:12.105
Now, look, it's all
the reason they needed.

11:12.139 --> 11:14.441
A National Guard regiment
arrived yesterday.

11:14.474 --> 11:18.178
And One Planet is coming up here
to end this once and for all.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.880
You know that granite wall
just south of here?

11:19.913 --> 11:21.081
-Yeah, The Drop.
-Yeah.

11:21.114 --> 11:22.349
Well, they're gonna blow
that all to hell.

11:22.382 --> 11:24.417
A load of dynamite
arrived yesterday.

11:24.451 --> 11:26.820
The coal company is keeping it
stored at a construction site,

11:26.854 --> 11:28.421
just outside of town.

11:28.455 --> 11:30.257
They're gonna carve a path
for their troops,

11:30.290 --> 11:31.458
their machines,

11:31.491 --> 11:33.393
whatever they want.

11:33.426 --> 11:35.796
How soon?

11:35.829 --> 11:37.731
Soon.

11:37.765 --> 11:39.867
"Soon," he says.
What's that mean?

11:39.900 --> 11:42.069
Two weeks? Two days?

11:42.102 --> 11:44.104
If they blow up The Drop,
what's to stop 'em?

11:44.137 --> 11:45.906
Nothing. That's what.

11:45.939 --> 11:48.175
-He's right.
-PHIL'UP: I say we fight.

11:48.208 --> 11:52.212
I was born on this mountain
and I'll die on this mountain.

11:52.245 --> 11:53.513
We can't take on no army.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.182
Okay, we got old and young
among us.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.917
We've only got supplies
to carry us through the winter,

11:56.950 --> 11:58.485
not to take on a fight
that we can't win.

11:58.518 --> 12:00.153
LIL FOSTER: All right,
but if he's telling the truth,

12:00.187 --> 12:01.855
they got dynamite.

12:01.889 --> 12:04.024
Maybe just go steal it.
That'd buy us some time.

12:07.194 --> 12:09.496
Go see if this lostie
is telling the truth.

12:09.529 --> 12:11.765
But don't take your eyes
off him, not for a second.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.466
-You understand?
-BIG FOSTER: I understand.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.930
Here.

12:42.963 --> 12:44.364
See right there?

12:44.397 --> 12:46.099
That green and red pod
right there?

12:48.401 --> 12:49.369
Inside there,

12:49.402 --> 12:51.571
280 sticks, 190 gram cylinders,

12:51.604 --> 12:53.473
Dyno Nobel, all top grade.

12:53.506 --> 12:55.008
I have the code to unlock it.

12:55.042 --> 12:56.276
We got to take out
the security cameras,

12:56.309 --> 12:58.511
we got to figure out what to do
about the guards and their dogs.

12:58.545 --> 12:59.579
And we got to do it soon.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.081
Saturday night...

13:01.114 --> 13:02.850
no workers, only two guards.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.217
We ain't got to worry
about them dogs.

13:04.251 --> 13:06.119
Yeah, them guards
ain't no concern, either.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.254
Yeah, well, don't be so sure.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.521
They brought in their own guys,

13:08.555 --> 13:10.057
professional security
contractors.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.992
These aren't mall rent-a-cops.

13:12.025 --> 13:15.028
Seems like you know
all there is to know.

13:15.062 --> 13:17.330
Well, I stole every secret
they have.

13:17.364 --> 13:20.467
Hmm. Well, maybe you got
a secret or two of your own.

13:20.500 --> 13:23.603
Hmm? Maybe at the end of this,
the law will be waiting for us

13:23.636 --> 13:25.839
down there and that's your plan?

13:25.873 --> 13:27.941
That sound about right?

13:27.975 --> 13:29.509
Look, if you don't trust me,
that's fine.

13:29.542 --> 13:32.045
That's your choice.
But the fact is,

13:32.079 --> 13:33.981
there's dynamite in there,
and they're gonna use it.

13:34.014 --> 13:35.883
LIL FOSTER: All right,
listen to me, lowlander.

13:35.916 --> 13:37.918
I'll die before I go back
into one of their jail cells

13:37.951 --> 13:39.953
and I'll take you with me.
You understand that?

13:39.987 --> 13:42.322
Yeah.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.324
(music playing low
in background)

13:46.493 --> 13:47.895
(kissing)

13:54.034 --> 13:57.070
(low rumbling)

13:57.104 --> 14:00.073
(rattling)

14:00.107 --> 14:02.175
(vehicles approaching)

14:06.079 --> 14:07.214
Hasil, just come back.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.420
(sighs)
Get back here.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.022
All this new law in town.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.057
Just ain't no end to it.

14:19.126 --> 14:21.094
I just can't figure it.

14:21.128 --> 14:23.496
I mean, going on a run
for flour and for water.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.933
We do without plenty
up on that mountain,

14:25.966 --> 14:28.168
but the Farrells,
they ain't ever lacked for food.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.436
What do you think happened?

14:31.704 --> 14:33.640
I don't know.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.613
(sighs)

14:40.647 --> 14:42.582
One thing's for sure.

14:45.352 --> 14:48.521
We brought hellfire down
on ourselves this time.

14:50.623 --> 14:53.560
Well, then I guess we just got
to stay in bed for a few days.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.095
Mm.

14:55.128 --> 14:59.132
Hey. What happens
when we run out of money?

14:59.166 --> 15:00.968
I mean,
with all this law around,

15:01.001 --> 15:03.303
how am I supposed to fight,
smarty-pants?

15:03.336 --> 15:05.538
That's for me to worry about.

15:05.572 --> 15:08.608
-(scoffs)
-I'm your manager now, remember?

15:08.641 --> 15:10.243
Mm.

15:10.277 --> 15:12.012
(vehicles approaching)

15:18.451 --> 15:21.121
(helicopter blades whirring)

15:26.226 --> 15:27.327
(door bells jingle)

15:41.041 --> 15:42.742
-What's this?
-An address.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.412
One of the early draws
cancelled.

15:45.445 --> 15:48.315
You wanted your man in
the major leagues, there you go.

15:48.348 --> 15:50.450
Bigger crowds, bigger money.

15:50.483 --> 15:51.418
Tennessee?

15:51.451 --> 15:53.220
-Is that a problem?
-No.

15:53.253 --> 15:55.055
Hasil sure can't fight
around here anymore.

15:55.088 --> 15:56.489
Shit, darling, nobody can.

15:56.523 --> 15:59.292
There's a goddamn uniform
on every corner.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.694
(clears throat) That ought to be
a good one, though.

16:01.728 --> 16:03.596
Like I said, big leagues.

16:03.630 --> 16:07.700
Look, these ain't no farm boys
or barroom brawlers.

16:07.734 --> 16:10.003
Your man best bring
his "A" game,

16:10.037 --> 16:11.638
or you best bring a shovel.

16:14.274 --> 16:16.043
Did she seem, um, angry?

16:16.076 --> 16:18.545
Um, more than usual?
Depressed, anything like that?

16:19.646 --> 16:21.281
Often, we find that the people

16:21.314 --> 16:23.216
might be making some sort
of final arrangements,

16:23.250 --> 16:24.717
or maybe, uh,
even saying good-bye,

16:24.751 --> 16:26.619
but it might not have seemed
like much at the time.

16:26.653 --> 16:29.489
Uh, no. Nothing.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.458
HOUGHTON: No? All right,
well, it might be an idea

16:31.491 --> 16:33.293
if I could have a look
at her e-mails

16:33.326 --> 16:35.528
-for the last couple of weeks.
-May I ask why?

16:35.562 --> 16:39.166
Um, yeah, I'm just checking off
the boxes.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.268
Has there been
a crime committed?

16:41.301 --> 16:43.136
Because we would require
a warrant

16:43.170 --> 16:44.771
for anything
on a company server.

16:44.804 --> 16:46.673
Yeah, okay. Um, I suppose

16:46.706 --> 16:48.408
it'd be the same thing
for a cell phone?

16:48.441 --> 16:51.111
If it was one
the company paid for, yes.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.680
And again, unless there is
reasonable suspicion

16:53.713 --> 16:55.348
of wrongdoing,

16:55.382 --> 16:58.085
not sure why
that would be necessary.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.253
Okay, well, uh...
oh, I almost forgot.

17:00.287 --> 17:02.322
Um, I need to ask you
about those jars that she had.

17:03.423 --> 17:04.791
-Jars?
-You remember,

17:04.824 --> 17:05.725
she came in the office,

17:05.758 --> 17:07.394
she had those two old Mason jars
with her?

17:07.427 --> 17:09.262
I mean, we-we talked about it
at the time.

17:09.296 --> 17:13.533
Uh, honestly, Sheriff, I-I don't
recall her having any jars.

17:13.566 --> 17:14.701
I'm-I'm sorry.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.238
Oh.

17:19.506 --> 17:20.440
(beeps)

17:43.363 --> 17:45.465
(sighs)

17:48.768 --> 17:50.803
(grunts)

17:50.837 --> 17:52.572
(sighs)

18:00.880 --> 18:03.650
(sniffs, spits)

18:03.683 --> 18:05.185
Pepper.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.377
*

18:38.451 --> 18:40.220
(door bells jingle)

18:41.321 --> 18:42.755
There he is.

18:42.789 --> 18:44.157
HOUGHTON:
Hey, Donnie.

18:44.191 --> 18:45.258
How's it going, Sheriff?

18:45.292 --> 18:47.494
-Uh, yeah, okay.
-Come on back.

18:47.527 --> 18:49.196
I say you're in luck.

18:49.229 --> 18:51.231
If this was eight dot five,
we'd be in deep shit,

18:51.264 --> 18:53.366
but it's a dot four,
so we are cooking with gas.

18:53.400 --> 18:54.601
Now, the first thing
that you're gonna do

18:54.634 --> 18:56.736
is ask Siri, "What time is it?"
All right?

18:56.769 --> 18:59.506
-Yeah. -That's gonna open up
your time zones, all right?

18:59.539 --> 19:01.574
Then, you're gonna create
an entirely new time zone.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.610
-Donnie...
-Any one'll do. All right?

19:03.643 --> 19:04.844
Then you're gonna share that

19:04.877 --> 19:06.546
and that's gonna open up
your contacts.

19:06.579 --> 19:08.448
Donnie.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.250
Ah, hell, I'll do it for you.

19:20.427 --> 19:22.362
*

19:56.996 --> 19:59.266
GORDON:
(sighs) Take it easy, fellas.

20:02.369 --> 20:03.936
-Well?
-Pack your things.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.772
Head back down the way you came.

20:05.805 --> 20:07.807
Yeah, I though she'd
cut you off at the knees.

20:07.840 --> 20:08.941
Guess I was right.

20:11.911 --> 20:13.846
You really don't get
what's at stake here, do you?

20:13.880 --> 20:16.015
Oh, no, what we get...

20:16.048 --> 20:19.552
we get a whole lot of noise
coming from you.

20:19.586 --> 20:21.354
Most of it lies, you ask me.

20:21.388 --> 20:23.690
So, take your cute
little campsite

20:23.723 --> 20:24.957
and get the hell out of here.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.493
GORDON: Listen,
you want to know the truth?

20:26.526 --> 20:28.261
-Yeah.
-Fine.

20:28.295 --> 20:29.562
It's not just the coal company
that's after me.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.498
I'm wanted in town.

20:31.531 --> 20:33.500
They're trying to pin
some murder on me right now,

20:33.533 --> 20:35.835
but it's not true.
(grunts)

20:35.868 --> 20:37.270
Go on.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.272
Keep talking.

20:39.306 --> 20:40.940
Yeah, maybe, um...

20:40.973 --> 20:43.743
maybe, uh, loosen
that snake tongue of yours up

20:43.776 --> 20:46.413
if I cut a fork in it.

20:46.446 --> 20:48.247
So what do you think about that?

20:50.016 --> 20:51.984
If I would have
told you the truth,

20:52.018 --> 20:53.853
you would have never believed me
about the dynamite.

20:55.822 --> 20:57.457
-Just listen to me.
-Yeah.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.459
-Okay?
-Uh-huh.

20:59.492 --> 21:00.960
I want to show you something.

21:02.995 --> 21:04.697
Please.

21:11.371 --> 21:13.406
See that?

21:13.440 --> 21:15.542
That's what they want to do
to your mountain.

21:15.575 --> 21:17.444
All right?

21:17.477 --> 21:21.514
And this is the equipment
they're gonna use to do it.

21:23.683 --> 21:26.953
Now, bringing this up here,
it ain't gonna be cheap.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.755
It's gonna cost them dearly.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.990
But I say,
let's make it cost more.

21:31.023 --> 21:32.859
Let's not just
steal the dynamite,

21:32.892 --> 21:34.394
let's use it on that.

21:36.663 --> 21:38.531
For a murderer,

21:38.565 --> 21:42.001
you know a lot
about who they are

21:42.034 --> 21:45.672
and what they're doing,
don't you?

21:45.705 --> 21:47.507
The coal company is threatening
to take me to the FBI

21:47.540 --> 21:51.778
unless I came up here and I get
information about your people.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.480
But I'm not gonna do that

21:53.513 --> 21:56.416
because I want to take them down
just as bad as you do.

21:56.449 --> 21:58.418
So that was your plan
the whole time.

21:58.451 --> 22:01.921
Get us to help you and then
leave us to suffer for it?

22:01.954 --> 22:05.392
I need your help, yeah.

22:05.425 --> 22:06.926
But it's them
that's gonna suffer.

22:06.959 --> 22:09.362
Mm-hmm.

22:09.396 --> 22:10.830
Look,

22:10.863 --> 22:12.832
you don't have to like me...

22:12.865 --> 22:16.569
Oh, we don't.

22:16.603 --> 22:18.805
...but we got to work on this
together.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.707
Because in the end,
we both want the same thing.

22:20.740 --> 22:22.008
And what's that?

22:23.876 --> 22:25.812
To save this mountain.

22:29.148 --> 22:30.650
I don't like it.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.719
They could be biding their time
down there,

22:32.752 --> 22:34.621
waiting for him
to lead us right to them.

22:34.654 --> 22:37.390
Hmm. Well, maybe,
but it don't change anything.

22:37.424 --> 22:39.526
What are all them new machines
for and all that law?

22:39.559 --> 22:42.061
No, they're coming,
and they're coming hard.

22:42.094 --> 22:44.497
Everything we have done
has come back on us tenfold.

22:44.531 --> 22:46.999
And now you want to trust an
outsider to lead us down a path

22:47.033 --> 22:48.635
that's gonna bring an army
up here.

22:48.668 --> 22:50.002
LIL FOSTER:
What else we gonna do?

22:50.036 --> 22:52.004
Just wait for them
to come on up here

22:52.038 --> 22:53.506
and blast us all to hell?

22:53.540 --> 22:54.774
That ain't no plan.
That's suicide.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.108
No, I'm with him.

22:56.142 --> 22:58.711
We... we steal that dynamite.

22:58.745 --> 23:00.613
I'm not gonna order you
as Bren'in.

23:00.647 --> 23:02.449
Okay, I'm gonna ask you.

23:02.482 --> 23:04.083
Don't lead us down this path.

23:04.116 --> 23:06.052
It will destroy us.

23:06.085 --> 23:08.020
(sighs)

23:16.596 --> 23:19.632
(door opens, closes)

23:20.900 --> 23:23.135
(knocking "shave and a haircut")

23:36.716 --> 23:38.050
You lost?

23:38.084 --> 23:40.920
I wanted to offer up
my apologies.

23:40.953 --> 23:42.889
What I done was wrong.

23:42.922 --> 23:47.694
It ain't right to cheat
no one... especially a friend.

23:47.727 --> 23:50.730
So, anyways, there it is.

23:50.763 --> 23:51.964
That's my sorry.

23:51.998 --> 23:53.566
Fine. You said it.

23:53.600 --> 23:54.967
It ain't just that.

23:55.001 --> 23:57.003
I don't have many friends,

23:57.036 --> 24:00.006
and-and I'm gonna make this
right with y'all.

24:00.039 --> 24:02.675
There's got to be
something I can do. Please.

24:05.745 --> 24:07.013
Give us your car.

24:07.046 --> 24:08.981
To have?

24:10.249 --> 24:11.684
No.

24:11.718 --> 24:14.621
Just to borrow tomorrow night.

24:14.654 --> 24:16.856
Yeah, I heard you're, uh,
fighting at the Mill, hmm?

24:16.889 --> 24:18.625
That's right.

24:18.658 --> 24:20.026
Yeah, uh, you know,

24:20.059 --> 24:23.530
I-I know I screwed up
on the manager thing.

24:23.563 --> 24:26.599
I just want to know if you, uh,
still need a cornerman.

24:30.770 --> 24:32.905
Yeah. You know anybody?

24:32.939 --> 24:34.741
(chuckles)

24:34.774 --> 24:36.709
(Butch laughs)

24:39.011 --> 24:42.549
-Oh. Oh, my man.
-(laughs)

24:42.582 --> 24:44.684
-Okay, what am I looking
at here? -These flakes here

24:44.717 --> 24:46.653
are polychlorinated
dibenzo p-dioxin.

24:46.686 --> 24:49.255
-PDPD for short. -HOUGHTON:
Yeah, listen, it's been a while

24:49.288 --> 24:51.858
since my last chemistry lesson,
so what's that mean?

24:51.891 --> 24:54.961
Basically, it's an enhanced
version of Agent Orange.

24:54.994 --> 24:56.796
What are you talking about,
Agent Orange?

24:56.829 --> 24:58.698
You mean like in Vietnam?

24:58.731 --> 25:00.199
Yeah, except this stuff's
been modified to absorb

25:00.232 --> 25:01.734
through the plant root system

25:01.768 --> 25:03.135
in addition
to its defoliant properties,

25:03.169 --> 25:06.138
and it'll stay active
in soil for a decade.

25:06.172 --> 25:07.874
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

25:07.907 --> 25:10.777
It's nasty stuff.
Where'd you get it?

25:10.810 --> 25:12.745
It's a, uh,
it's an open investigation.

25:12.779 --> 25:14.781
Listen, I need you to send me
these original samples

25:14.814 --> 25:16.315
soon as you're done
with them, okay?

25:16.348 --> 25:19.151
And, uh, get me the lab results.

25:37.904 --> 25:41.808
This dynamite...
I know you think it foolish,

25:41.841 --> 25:44.043
but it has to be done.

25:44.076 --> 25:46.112
And I come to ask
your blessing on it.

25:46.145 --> 25:48.280
(scoffs)
What for?

25:48.314 --> 25:50.583
You're gonna steal it anyway,
ain't that right?

25:53.653 --> 25:56.989
If there is a path to glory
paved with fury and strife,

25:57.023 --> 25:58.357
you're bound to walk it,
ain't you?

25:58.390 --> 26:01.594
No, you're wrong.

26:01.628 --> 26:04.163
Ain't none of this
to glory myself.

26:04.196 --> 26:07.333
This is for the future
of this clan.

26:07.366 --> 26:10.970
It's for you and me
and all that's come to us.

26:13.372 --> 26:15.041
Then you're wasting your time.

26:15.074 --> 26:17.910
There ain't nothing left
between us anymore, Foster,

26:17.944 --> 26:19.946
-not a single thing.
-What do you mean "nothing"?

26:19.979 --> 26:23.716
That child,
it may not be my seed...

26:23.750 --> 26:26.052
but it is still my blood.

26:26.085 --> 26:29.221
After all I've done for you,
you owe me that respect.

26:29.255 --> 26:31.658
All you done is what suited you

26:31.691 --> 26:33.025
since the day
you came back up here.

26:33.059 --> 26:36.829
All right, now,
you listen to me.

26:36.863 --> 26:40.633
I am... your husband.

26:40.667 --> 26:43.269
And I have fought for you.

26:43.302 --> 26:45.705
I have honored you.
I have defended you.

26:45.738 --> 26:48.975
I'd have died for you
and I would again.

26:49.008 --> 26:52.645
I know you would've, Foster...

26:52.679 --> 26:56.115
but only because it's easier
than living for me.

26:56.148 --> 26:59.051
What we have,
it wasn't born out of love.

26:59.085 --> 27:02.254
It was born out of fear,
mine and yours,

27:02.288 --> 27:03.790
and it was never meant
for this world.

27:03.823 --> 27:05.057
All right, G'winveer...

27:05.091 --> 27:06.893
-I release you from our union.
-No.

27:06.926 --> 27:09.228
-No. No, no, no! You can't,
you can't. -Three times spoken.

27:09.261 --> 27:11.030
You can't,
you can't just release me.

27:11.063 --> 27:13.132
-It's not our way.
-Three times spoken.

27:13.165 --> 27:15.101
Three times to tear
our bond asunder.

27:15.134 --> 27:18.104
-No.
-Ayn-tei thee aih.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.940
All right, all right. What have
you done, huh? What've you done?

27:20.973 --> 27:23.810
Nothing but hide behind that
Oak, blind to all the danger.

27:23.843 --> 27:25.778
-Ayn-tei thee aih.
-All right? And you are weak!

27:25.812 --> 27:28.848
You hear me? You are nothing
without me standing behind you!

27:28.881 --> 27:31.718
-Ayn-tei thee aih.
-No! No!

27:31.751 --> 27:33.686
No!

27:37.089 --> 27:38.357
-(softly): No.
-It's done.

27:41.327 --> 27:42.929
(softly):
No.

27:42.962 --> 27:45.364
It's done.

28:11.891 --> 28:14.160
HOUGHTON: Cause of death is
asphyxiation by strangulation,

28:14.193 --> 28:15.928
-manner of death, suicide.
-Mm-hmm.

28:18.030 --> 28:20.767
What's this?
What's this up here?

28:20.800 --> 28:23.770
Subdural hematoma
just above the occipital ridge.

28:23.803 --> 28:25.772
It's a, it's a bump
on the back of the head.

28:25.805 --> 28:29.876
Some swelling,
a small laceration, half inch.

28:29.909 --> 28:31.377
How long that'd happen
before she died?

28:31.410 --> 28:33.212
I'd say a few minutes
before the actual time of death,

28:33.245 --> 28:35.281
that's my estimate.

28:35.314 --> 28:37.750
A few minutes? I mean,
how'd she manage that?

28:37.784 --> 28:39.251
Well, she hung herself
in the shower, Wade.

28:39.285 --> 28:42.321
It's a tight space.
She would've convulsed.

28:42.354 --> 28:44.356
You know, muscle activity can
last as long as eight minutes,

28:44.390 --> 28:45.958
sometimes more.

28:45.992 --> 28:49.028
It's consistent
with the manner of death.

29:14.386 --> 29:16.322
*

29:42.915 --> 29:45.484
*

29:47.887 --> 29:50.556
(grunting)

29:51.891 --> 29:54.593
Come on. 25, 26.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.062
Come on, man, 27, push it.

30:00.032 --> 30:02.168
(grunting)

30:07.206 --> 30:10.009
Look, check it out.

30:10.042 --> 30:12.044
That's the guy.

30:12.078 --> 30:13.479
Now, you see that little...
(karate yell)...

30:13.512 --> 30:15.081
-move he does there?
-Yeah.

30:15.114 --> 30:17.984
That's, like,
his signature move.

30:21.053 --> 30:22.488
So, what you think?

30:25.925 --> 30:27.960
Well, I think
if I was you, I'd...

30:27.994 --> 30:30.462
I'd bet on the other fella.

30:30.496 --> 30:33.065
(Butch chuckles)

30:38.504 --> 30:40.306
(dog barking)

30:40.339 --> 30:43.442
(grunts)

30:43.475 --> 30:46.145
LIL FOSTER:
There's houndsbane in it.

30:46.178 --> 30:47.279
Won't kill them, will it?

30:47.313 --> 30:50.082
No, just knock 'em out.

30:50.116 --> 30:51.383
All right. Let's go.

30:54.453 --> 30:55.587
(dog barks)

31:05.231 --> 31:08.267
GORDON:
Okay, there they are.

31:11.603 --> 31:12.638
Now, when those cameras
go down,

31:12.671 --> 31:13.605
they're gonna come running.

31:21.981 --> 31:24.416
Sure you still got the eyes
for this, old man?

31:24.450 --> 31:28.254
Mm. You just watch me.

31:36.328 --> 31:38.597
-Ged-gedyah.
-Ged-gedyah.

31:44.971 --> 31:47.206
Looks like the lights are out.

31:47.239 --> 31:48.975
GUARD 2: Yeah, both of them.
Maybe they shorted or something.

31:49.008 --> 31:51.043
GUARD 1:
Yeah... Check it out.

31:57.483 --> 32:00.953
-Hey, hey! Looking for us?!
-Stop right there.

32:17.736 --> 32:19.538
(beeping)

32:27.546 --> 32:29.481
*

32:33.419 --> 32:35.087
Nice.

32:36.122 --> 32:40.659
Garcia, Kowalski, come in.

32:40.692 --> 32:42.061
You guys copy?

32:42.094 --> 32:44.130
Put that by the door.

32:47.199 --> 32:50.269
Wire, blasting caps.

32:50.302 --> 32:52.071
Take this.

32:53.705 --> 32:55.474
(chuckles)

32:55.507 --> 32:57.476
Good old-fashioned pyro fuse.

33:01.513 --> 33:03.982
(dog whines softly)

33:13.359 --> 33:15.561
(clattering)

33:15.594 --> 33:16.662
You inside.

33:16.695 --> 33:19.198
Come out right now.

33:19.231 --> 33:21.300
Hands over your head.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.035
Move.

33:27.673 --> 33:31.077
Hands where I can see them now!

33:31.110 --> 33:33.245
All right!

33:33.279 --> 33:36.315
All right, don't shoot!

33:36.348 --> 33:38.084
I'm coming out!

33:38.117 --> 33:40.419
All right, I'm coming out.
Don't shoot!

33:40.452 --> 33:43.722
Okay, okay.

33:43.755 --> 33:45.191
Okay, look,
you got to help me, please.

33:45.224 --> 33:47.093
GUARD:
On your knees, right there.

33:47.126 --> 33:48.060
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

33:49.295 --> 33:51.097
Okay, look...

33:51.130 --> 33:53.299
I was camping
and they kidnapped me.

33:54.733 --> 33:55.767
There's one of them
still inside.

33:58.404 --> 33:59.538
-Stay right there.
You don't move. -Okay.

33:59.571 --> 34:02.074
(gun cocks)

34:05.811 --> 34:08.080
Be careful. He's got a gun.

34:15.187 --> 34:16.622
(grunts)

34:19.158 --> 34:21.093
(grunts)

34:25.164 --> 34:26.798
LIL FOSTER: Y'all take care
of those two guards?

34:26.832 --> 34:29.168
Yeah, of course we did.
What the hell happened?

34:29.201 --> 34:30.402
I thought you said
there was only two.

34:30.436 --> 34:31.537
Guess I was wrong.

34:32.804 --> 34:35.274
But I fixed it.

34:40.312 --> 34:42.080
Trust me now?

34:55.527 --> 34:57.429
(indistinct conversations)

35:15.747 --> 35:17.683

35:22.221 --> 35:25.157
ANNOUNCER (over P.A.):

Hasil, baby.

35:41.707 --> 35:43.775
ANNOUNCER:
And his opponent,

35:43.809 --> 35:47.679
all the way from the streets
of Accra, Ghana,

35:47.713 --> 35:51.217
Francois "The Hyena"

35:51.250 --> 35:53.819
Achebe!

(crowd cheering)

35:55.587 --> 35:56.855
REFEREE:
Are you ready?

35:56.888 --> 35:58.724
Are you ready?

35:58.757 --> 35:59.791
Let's do this!

35:59.825 --> 36:01.393

36:13.605 --> 36:16.608

Stop, stop, stop! Come on!

37:11.297 --> 37:12.964
Get up! Illegal strike!

37:12.998 --> 37:14.933
Illegal half strike
to the back of the head.

37:14.966 --> 37:17.403
Get back to your corner.
Back to your corner.

37:17.436 --> 37:19.571

37:19.605 --> 37:20.906
REFEREE (echoing):
Subtract one point!

37:20.939 --> 37:22.741
One point deduction!

37:22.774 --> 37:25.944
Stay back. Stay back
in your corner. Stay back.

37:28.347 --> 37:31.016

37:35.387 --> 37:37.356

37:40.926 --> 37:43.329
REFEREE: You can't hit to the
back of the head. Stay there.

37:44.930 --> 37:47.666
Are you okay to continue?

37:47.699 --> 37:49.368
Are you ready?
Are you ready?

37:49.401 --> 37:50.436
Come on, let's do this!

Hold still. You're all right.

38:30.542 --> 38:32.378
Hold still.

38:41.019 --> 38:44.990
That's $11,280.

38:45.023 --> 38:46.892
(chuckles)

38:46.925 --> 38:49.127
Count it,
if you guys got the time.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.530
-I lost, Butch.
-Yeah, I know you lost.

38:51.563 --> 38:52.964
But I did what you said.

38:52.998 --> 38:55.801
I bet on the other guy.
(clicks tongue, chuckles)

38:55.834 --> 38:59.605
All right, party people,
I'm out.

38:59.638 --> 39:00.806
I'll see y'all tomorrow.

39:00.839 --> 39:02.040
-Thank you.
-Yes, sir.

39:04.876 --> 39:06.144
Baby, we can get a car.

39:06.177 --> 39:07.846
We can get a new apartment.

39:07.879 --> 39:09.881
We can get a TV, we...

39:09.915 --> 39:11.483
We can do whatever we want.

39:11.517 --> 39:13.084
That's good.

39:17.088 --> 39:19.958
Hey, what's wrong?

39:23.194 --> 39:27.065
In the cage...

39:27.098 --> 39:29.435
when I was laying there...

39:33.605 --> 39:36.542
...the whole world
was spinning around me, and...

39:38.744 --> 39:41.447
...that's when I saw my kin.

39:44.182 --> 39:46.952
They were all looking at me.

39:49.688 --> 39:52.791
Just standing there,
looking at me,

39:52.824 --> 39:55.627
like they needed me.

40:05.704 --> 40:07.739
Go to them.

40:10.576 --> 40:12.010
No.

40:13.879 --> 40:15.847
No, I can't do that.

40:15.881 --> 40:17.483
I can't just leave you.

40:17.516 --> 40:18.850
(groans)

40:18.884 --> 40:21.987
It's not safe.
I don't...

40:22.020 --> 40:24.122
I don't know
what's going on up there.

40:24.155 --> 40:27.025
-Hasil...
-(groans softly)

40:27.058 --> 40:29.027
...that's why you got to go.

40:29.060 --> 40:31.062
I'll be right here waiting
for you when you get back.

40:37.569 --> 40:39.838
I'm gonna get ready for bed.

40:42.874 --> 40:44.910
See you soon. (kisses)

40:54.119 --> 40:55.854
I love you.
You know that, right?

40:58.790 --> 41:00.726
I love you, too, Hasil Farrell.

41:24.115 --> 41:26.051

41:30.221 --> 41:32.958
(sighs)

41:35.794 --> 41:37.896
(sighs)

41:47.839 --> 41:49.675
All right.

41:49.708 --> 41:51.677
Are we clear on the setup?

41:51.710 --> 41:53.178
Blasting caps go in the sticks.

41:53.211 --> 41:55.180
Wire connects the caps
to the electronic detonator box.

41:55.213 --> 41:56.181
Yeah, we got it.

41:56.214 --> 41:57.549
All right, then.

41:57.583 --> 41:58.917
I'm gonna head back down.

41:58.950 --> 42:01.252
Still don't like it,
him runnin' off,

42:01.286 --> 42:03.021
leavin' us with the bag.

42:03.054 --> 42:05.591
Should I have killed
those guards?

42:05.624 --> 42:08.193
Would that have earned
your trust?

42:08.226 --> 42:11.997
I told you,
I'd die to save this mountain.

42:12.030 --> 42:15.000
Question is: would you?

42:15.033 --> 42:16.702
BIG FOSTER:
Hey.

42:16.735 --> 42:20.005
Murderer,
take a good look around.

42:20.038 --> 42:23.208
Our people been dying
for this mountain

42:23.241 --> 42:26.144
before you were a twinkle
in your daddy's eye.

42:26.177 --> 42:27.946
Don't you ever forget that.

42:31.249 --> 42:34.953
-Ged-gedyah.
-Ged-gedyah.

42:36.221 --> 42:38.189
Ged-gedyah.

42:38.223 --> 42:40.158
Let's go.

42:44.362 --> 42:46.331
MEYERS:
You helped them steal it,

42:46.364 --> 42:49.935
seriously wounding
three security contractors,

42:49.968 --> 42:51.870
one of whom you hospitalized.

42:51.903 --> 42:54.305
Look, I did what I had to do.
I gained the Farrells' trust.

42:54.339 --> 42:56.074
Do you know where
they're storing it, at least?

42:56.107 --> 42:58.376
No. But I know it's up there.

42:58.409 --> 43:01.346
You think this is acceptable?

43:01.379 --> 43:03.214
You were supposed
to bring us information.

43:03.248 --> 43:05.083
Perhaps you've forgotten
how easy it would be

43:05.116 --> 43:07.352
for me to feed you
to the wolves of the FBI.

43:07.385 --> 43:09.821
What does handing me over
to the FBI do for you,

43:09.855 --> 43:11.356
besides getting me hauled off?

43:11.389 --> 43:14.960
Look, the way I see it,
you have one option here,

43:14.993 --> 43:17.896
convince the Feds to take
100% responsibility of this.

43:17.929 --> 43:20.832
Catching the Farrells
stealing some dynamite--

43:20.866 --> 43:23.101
it's gonna get you nowhere.

43:23.134 --> 43:25.737
Catching the Farrells
in a terrorist act,

43:25.771 --> 43:28.740
attempting to blow up
the offices of One Planet--

43:28.774 --> 43:31.342
now, that's a guarantee.

43:31.376 --> 43:33.411
And you can deliver that?

43:33.444 --> 43:34.946
I can.

43:34.980 --> 43:36.314
And I will.

43:36.347 --> 43:38.316
Man,

43:38.349 --> 43:41.920
you just put a knife right in
the Farrells' backs, didn't you?

43:41.953 --> 43:43.054
How does a bleeding heart
like you

43:43.088 --> 43:44.790
live with something like that?

43:44.823 --> 43:47.125
Because I don't give a shit
about the Farrells.

43:47.158 --> 43:49.160
That's why. Or any of us.

43:49.194 --> 43:52.430
Humanity is
an evolutionary mistake.

43:52.463 --> 43:54.432
We are a toxic virus

43:54.465 --> 43:56.434
that has been killing
this planet for years.

43:56.467 --> 44:00.338
The only thing I care about
is this Earth.

44:00.371 --> 44:02.841
This beautiful, perfect Earth.

44:02.874 --> 44:04.876
That's all.

44:07.813 --> 44:10.982
Well, when that mountain's
getting blown into pea gravel

44:11.016 --> 44:14.052
and hauled away in trucks,

44:14.085 --> 44:16.187
I'll remember you said that.

44:25.263 --> 44:27.198
(quiet clucking)

44:32.070 --> 44:34.105
Foster, not now, okay?

44:34.139 --> 44:36.107
-It's done.
-This won't take long.

44:36.141 --> 44:38.977
I come to tell you,
'fore you hear it from others,

44:39.010 --> 44:41.046
that I went against your word.

44:41.079 --> 44:44.182
We took from our enemy what
they would have used against us.

44:45.917 --> 44:47.953
I didn't have to hear it
from anyone.

44:47.986 --> 44:49.287
I know what you did.

44:49.320 --> 44:51.823
I did what had to be done.

44:51.857 --> 44:54.359
I offer no sorrys for it.

44:54.392 --> 44:57.729
When I come back up
this mountain, I had one mind:

44:57.763 --> 45:01.800
to gain your trust
and earn your love.

45:01.833 --> 45:03.434
I failed.

45:03.468 --> 45:05.971
And I know that now.

45:06.004 --> 45:08.339
But I learned something
since then.

45:08.373 --> 45:12.343
I learned the true reason
that I was brought back up here.

45:12.377 --> 45:14.913
'Cause you ain't equal
to that Oak.

45:14.946 --> 45:18.083
Not in these times.

45:18.116 --> 45:21.753
And I am no longer bound
by your orders.

45:21.787 --> 45:24.255
You are no Bren'in to me.

45:32.330 --> 45:34.499
You'll be the death
of this ancient clan,

45:34.532 --> 45:37.302
Foster Farrell VI,

45:37.335 --> 45:40.371
and destroyer
of this sacred mountain.

45:40.405 --> 45:43.942
I love you, G'Winveer,

45:43.975 --> 45:45.777
and I always will.

45:45.811 --> 45:47.178
Know that.

45:49.247 --> 45:52.317
But this ain't
about love anymore.

45:52.350 --> 45:55.420
We are at war.

45:55.453 --> 45:58.423
And it is a war
that I intend to win.

46:11.136 --> 46:13.071
