<i>Previously on
"The Cleaning Lady"...</i>

00:04.265 --> 00:06.223
I don't know whether you
heard, but after your meeting,
the FBI stormed in.

00:06.223 --> 00:07.659
They killed Cortes.

00:07.659 --> 00:10.097
I have someone else who
will buy the drugs from you,

00:10.097 --> 00:12.795
but this time the deal
will be made on my terms.

00:12.795 --> 00:15.363
I need you and Chris to come in
to the station for questioning.

00:15.363 --> 00:17.800
We have new evidence in
the murder of Marco De La Rosa.

00:17.800 --> 00:20.063
I protected you
when you shot Cortes!

00:20.063 --> 00:21.630
Now it's your turn
to protect me!

00:21.630 --> 00:23.327
Thony De La Rosa
needs to be released.

00:23.327 --> 00:25.590
She's an important asset
in a federal case.

00:25.590 --> 00:28.332
From what you've told me,
it wasn't your fault, Chris.

00:28.332 --> 00:31.031
It was an accident.
I'm not gonna bring you in.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.685
Thony, Arman.
Meet Maya Campbell.

00:33.685 --> 00:38.038
Either you two are also rats
or you're people I can trust.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.083
Prove your loyalty.

00:40.083 --> 00:41.345
I'm not gonna
shoot this girl.

00:41.345 --> 00:42.999
Because it's the only way
you and Thony

00:42.999 --> 00:44.435
will get out of here alive.

00:44.435 --> 00:46.698
Don't do this! Please!

00:46.698 --> 00:50.833
Is it her? Is it Maya?
Is it Maya?!

00:50.833 --> 00:52.574
I'm so sorry, Garrett.

What?
What is it?

02:05.037 --> 02:06.952
You and the kids
need to go now.

02:06.952 --> 02:08.389
Huh?
I packed Luca his bag,

02:08.389 --> 02:11.957
but I need to go through
his medications with you.

02:11.957 --> 02:13.959
Wait--
Just come.

02:18.616 --> 02:21.271
These are the directions
for Luca's medications.

02:21.271 --> 02:23.491
As soon as you get there,
you put it in the fridge.

02:23.491 --> 02:25.232
What? Where are we
supposed to go, Thony?

02:25.232 --> 02:27.930
Well, I was thinking JD's.
He just moved in, right?

02:27.930 --> 02:30.280
Yeah, but I can't just
show up at his door.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.543
You said you were gonna
tell me what's going on.

02:32.543 --> 02:35.590
So, I mean, what happened
last night?

02:35.590 --> 02:37.940
What-- What are we
running from, huh?

02:38.984 --> 02:43.206
I've been helping Garrett
find evidence on a man,

02:43.206 --> 02:45.208
someone very dangerous,

02:45.208 --> 02:46.514
and I just want
to make sure

02:46.514 --> 02:49.169
nothing bad happens
to you and the kids.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.258
I can't talk
about what happened,

02:51.258 --> 02:53.129
but just trust me.

02:53.129 --> 02:56.611
Is-- Is that why he was
in our living room all night?

02:56.611 --> 03:00.397
Yeah. I asked him to stay here
until I finished a deal.

03:00.397 --> 03:03.226
What--
But it's not over?

03:03.226 --> 03:04.706
No. Fi.

03:04.706 --> 03:06.360
As soon as I know
it's safe,

03:06.360 --> 03:08.188
you and the kids,
you come back home.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.233
Wait. Wait!

03:10.233 --> 03:11.626
You're not coming with us?
No.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.628
If-- If we go,
we go together, okay?

03:13.628 --> 03:15.282
The FBI can handle this
without you.

03:15.282 --> 03:17.022
It's not your job!

03:17.022 --> 03:18.198
I can't. I'm sorry.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.243
I need to finish this
with Arman.

03:20.243 --> 03:21.853
Oh.
So this is about <i>him?</i>

03:21.853 --> 03:25.988
No, it's about you!
It's about our family.

03:25.988 --> 03:28.860
This man threatened us.
He knows Luca's name.

03:28.860 --> 03:31.602
He knows about you,
the kids, where we live.

03:31.602 --> 03:34.257
It's not safe.
You have to go now.

03:40.785 --> 03:44.572
Chris.

03:44.572 --> 03:47.227
Wake up, <i>anak.</i>
Chris.[Sleepily] Mom.

03:47.227 --> 03:48.445
Chris, we--Mom, it's Saturday.

03:48.445 --> 03:50.534
I know. I know.

03:50.534 --> 03:52.493
We have to go now, so
you have to pack a bag, okay?

03:52.493 --> 03:53.711
Come on.
Wait. What?

03:53.711 --> 03:55.322
- Where are we going?
- Just come on.

03:55.322 --> 03:57.280
What's going on?

03:57.280 --> 03:59.935
W-We'll talk
about it later, okay?

03:59.935 --> 04:01.110
Come on.

04:01.110 --> 04:02.720
Are the cops back?

04:02.720 --> 04:07.334
N-No, i-it's just--
it's just Jaz and Luca.

04:07.334 --> 04:09.249
Garrett said he wasn't
going to say anything,

04:09.249 --> 04:11.381
and he won't, okay?

04:11.381 --> 04:12.904
We're just--

04:12.904 --> 04:16.081
We're just going to JD's
for a little while, okay?

04:16.081 --> 04:18.475
Okay. W-Why?
W-What's this about?

04:18.475 --> 04:20.042
Auntie T?
Is she okay?

04:20.042 --> 04:23.088
No. She's fine.
It-- It's just a precaution.

04:23.088 --> 04:25.395
Okay? So--But this is about her?

04:25.395 --> 04:27.397
Is that why the FBI agent
stayed last night?

04:27.397 --> 04:29.878
Wait.
Did something happen?

04:32.489 --> 04:34.752
I can't tell you
what happened because--

04:34.752 --> 04:37.886
Hey.
Because I don't know.

04:40.584 --> 04:44.022
Thony's working with Garrett
on an FBI investigation,

04:44.022 --> 04:47.765
and-- t-that's all
we're supposed to know.

04:47.765 --> 04:51.639
But we've been told
it's not safe here,

04:51.639 --> 04:54.511
not until she's finished
with this.

04:54.511 --> 04:56.948
What I need from you
is to help me

04:56.948 --> 04:59.690
with Jaz and Luca
without scaring them.

04:59.690 --> 05:01.779
They can't suspect
anything is wrong.

05:01.779 --> 05:03.955
Can you do that for me,
<i>anak?</i>

05:03.955 --> 05:05.609
Huh?

05:05.609 --> 05:06.784
Yeah.
Yeah?

05:06.784 --> 05:08.308
Yeah, okay.
I got you, Mom.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.310
Okay. Thank you. Yeah.

05:16.794 --> 05:18.361
I still think you should
come with us.

05:18.361 --> 05:19.536
We should all
stick together.

05:19.536 --> 05:21.233
I know, Fi.
I wish I could.

05:21.233 --> 05:22.626
Trust me.

05:22.626 --> 05:24.672
I couldn't find my phone
charger. Did you take it?

05:24.672 --> 05:26.804
No, but my dad should have one
you can borrow.

05:26.804 --> 05:27.892
Okay.

05:27.892 --> 05:29.329
I don't want to go.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.460
Come on, Luca. Hey.

05:30.460 --> 05:32.636
A staycation
at JD's house?

05:32.636 --> 05:35.465
- It'll be bomb.
- Okay.

05:35.465 --> 05:37.032
You sure you can't come,
Auntie T?

05:37.032 --> 05:38.425
No, she's gotta be here

05:38.425 --> 05:40.905
for when the landlord
sends the plumber.

05:40.905 --> 05:43.168
Yeah.

05:43.168 --> 05:44.953
Okay.
Everybody, let's go.

05:44.953 --> 05:47.129
- Alright, come on.
- Go, go, go, go, go, go.

05:52.177 --> 05:55.485
Okay, so, call me if there's
any sign of rejection,

05:55.485 --> 05:57.661
and if for any reason
you can't reach me,

05:57.661 --> 05:59.184
just give him
the prednisone--

05:59.184 --> 06:01.839
I-I know, Thony.
I got it.

06:01.839 --> 06:04.451
I will take care of him, but...

06:04.451 --> 06:06.366
But please be safe.

06:06.366 --> 06:07.671
Yeah.
Okay?

06:07.671 --> 06:08.803
Okay.

06:08.803 --> 06:11.371
I'll call you soon.
<i>Mahal kita.</i>

06:11.371 --> 06:14.635
Okay. <i>Mahal kita.</i>

06:17.507 --> 06:21.859
You're gonna be good
for Tita Fi and for JD.

06:21.859 --> 06:24.514
I wish you could
come with me, Mommy.

06:24.514 --> 06:26.516
I wish I could come, too,
but you know what?

06:26.516 --> 06:28.866
You're gonna be back home
in no time.

06:30.477 --> 06:31.521
I love you.

06:31.521 --> 06:33.218
I love you, Mommy.

06:35.699 --> 06:37.397
Okay.

06:38.528 --> 06:40.530
Have fun, guys!

06:40.530 --> 06:42.314
Fi, thank you.

07:07.035 --> 07:08.166
Garrett.

07:10.734 --> 07:13.911
I, uh--
I took every precaution.

07:13.911 --> 07:15.913
I followed
every protocol.

07:15.913 --> 07:18.742
How did they find her
in that safe house?

07:18.742 --> 07:22.180
Garrett,
this isn't your fault.

07:22.180 --> 07:24.008
Is that, um--

07:24.008 --> 07:25.880
Maya's effects.

07:28.926 --> 07:31.973
I just spoke
to her family.

07:31.973 --> 07:34.366
It's gonna be a few days
before they fly in.

07:34.366 --> 07:38.719
I told you.
I'd handle that call.

07:38.719 --> 07:43.463
Please. Garrett.
Take some time off.

07:43.463 --> 07:45.769
They took Maya alive.

07:45.769 --> 07:49.425
The chair was broken.
There was blood on the floor.

07:49.425 --> 07:51.166
She put up a fight.

07:52.646 --> 07:54.648
I failed her.

07:54.648 --> 07:57.172
And now she's dead.

07:57.172 --> 08:01.481
So until I figure out how
they found her in a <i>safe house,</i>

08:01.481 --> 08:06.355
I am not taking
any time off!

08:06.355 --> 08:07.835
Who else knew about Maya?

08:07.835 --> 08:10.620
Other than you, me,
and Jefferson, huh?

08:10.620 --> 08:12.143
Do not go there.

08:12.143 --> 08:14.842
This wasn't any of
your fellow agents.

08:14.842 --> 08:17.714
That's the only thing
that makes any sense!

08:17.714 --> 08:20.587
A mole.
Nobody followed me.

08:20.587 --> 08:22.980
So someone from the FBI
must have tipped off Kamdar.

08:22.980 --> 08:24.982
That's it. It's time
for you to go home.

08:24.982 --> 08:27.115
Yeah, like hell
I'm going anywhere!

08:27.115 --> 08:29.334
Look, I know
how you're feeling.

08:29.334 --> 08:30.988
We've all been there.

08:30.988 --> 08:32.816
But unless you can keep
a cool head,

08:32.816 --> 08:34.818
I'm putting you on leave.

08:36.254 --> 08:40.215
I'm not going anywhere
until we get Kamdar.

08:42.173 --> 08:43.697
Good.

08:43.697 --> 08:46.003
I just spoke to the financial
crimes experts this morning,

08:46.003 --> 08:47.962
and they feel confident
that we can nail Kamdar

08:47.962 --> 08:49.093
on criminal profiteering.

08:49.093 --> 08:51.269
No, Russo.
He's a murderer!

08:51.269 --> 08:53.620
Huh? What, are we gonna put him
away for a couple years

08:53.620 --> 08:54.795
for a white-collar crime?

08:54.795 --> 08:55.970
You know
it's nearly impossible

08:55.970 --> 08:58.189
to pin murder
on guys like Kamdar.

08:58.189 --> 09:00.757
They're never the ones
pulling the trigger.

09:00.757 --> 09:03.499
So we need to focus
on the evidence we can get.

09:03.499 --> 09:04.979
No.

09:04.979 --> 09:07.198
That son of a bitch
is going away for life.

09:21.604 --> 09:23.563
Thony?

09:44.627 --> 09:46.368
Did your family leave?

09:48.457 --> 09:49.806
Yeah.

09:51.634 --> 09:53.636
You should have gone
with them.

09:53.636 --> 09:56.639
If Kamdar's watching me,
I can't run.

09:58.075 --> 10:01.035
Alright, well, I'm staying here.
You shouldn't be alone.

10:05.517 --> 10:09.478
I just keep replaying it
in my mind...

10:09.478 --> 10:11.611
what he made you do.

10:14.004 --> 10:16.746
Maybe we could have done
something different.

10:16.746 --> 10:19.096
I don't know.

10:23.797 --> 10:26.234
Did Garrett mention
anything about Maya

10:26.234 --> 10:28.279
when you last spoke
with him?

10:29.672 --> 10:31.108
No.

10:32.675 --> 10:36.244
But I could hear it
in his voice.

10:36.244 --> 10:39.116
He knows she's dead.

10:39.116 --> 10:41.597
And now I have to go
lie to him about it.

11:01.138 --> 11:03.445
Let's go.
Let's do this.

11:13.890 --> 11:16.458
Give a man a minute
to get to the door!

11:18.765 --> 11:20.505
Hey, Dad.
Hey, baby girl.

11:20.505 --> 11:22.464
The whole crew!

11:22.464 --> 11:23.900
- I love it.
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.206
Where's Thony?

11:25.206 --> 11:27.469
Uh, someone has to
wait for the landlord.

11:27.469 --> 11:31.125
Ugh. I'm just glad it's not me.
I hate that guy.

11:32.343 --> 11:33.388
Huh.

11:33.388 --> 11:35.129
Sorry about the mess.

11:35.129 --> 11:37.827
Don't worry.
It makes us feel right at home.

12:08.336 --> 12:10.730
Anyone follow you?

12:10.730 --> 12:13.080
We would have seen them.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.952
Kamdar got to Maya.
She's dead.

12:15.952 --> 12:18.825
They shot her, dumped her
in the Colorado River.

12:21.044 --> 12:24.091
I'm really sorry, Garrett.

12:26.702 --> 12:29.052
So why did you
call us here?

12:29.052 --> 12:31.054
- What's the plan?
- The plan has changed.

12:31.054 --> 12:33.230
Now we're gonna take Kamdar
down for murder--

12:33.230 --> 12:35.232
him and whoever
pulled the trigger.

12:35.232 --> 12:37.365
Anyone who touched her
or even looked at her.

12:37.365 --> 12:39.759
I'm gonna make sure
every one of those bastards

12:39.759 --> 12:41.151
rots behind bars.

12:41.151 --> 12:44.633
And you guys?
You're gonna help me do that.

12:50.117 --> 12:52.859
No, we can't do that.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.077
What?

12:54.077 --> 12:55.818
Kamdar doesn't know
I knew Maya.

12:55.818 --> 12:57.689
If we start asking
questions about her,

12:57.689 --> 13:00.605
he'll figure out that
we've been working for you.

13:00.605 --> 13:02.129
- He'll kill us both.
- She's right.

13:02.129 --> 13:04.087
I think it's best we stick
with the original plan.

13:04.087 --> 13:05.915
It's not up to you two, alright?

13:05.915 --> 13:08.700
I'm your handler.
I'm the one who calls the shots.

13:08.700 --> 13:12.400
And you're gonna do what
I tell you to do. You hear me?

13:12.400 --> 13:15.446
And that is help me find
who killed Maya.

13:24.107 --> 13:25.587
When's your next meet-up
with Kamdar?

13:25.587 --> 13:27.502
He still owes us that cut
from last night's deal.

13:27.502 --> 13:30.244
Okay. Good.
Set up the meeting for today.

13:30.244 --> 13:33.813
I'm not wearing a wire,
and neither is she.

13:33.813 --> 13:35.858
You want to get back
to your family, Thony?

13:35.858 --> 13:37.033
This is the fastest way.

13:37.033 --> 13:38.861
We'd get caught, Garrett.

13:38.861 --> 13:42.909
Anyone who get into Kamdar's
office is checked for wires.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.345
Any signal,
he'll find it.

13:44.345 --> 13:46.869
Alright. Fine. Then we'll
put this on your phone.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.175
Cellphones already
give off signals.

13:48.175 --> 13:49.654
He takes
our cellphones, too.

13:49.654 --> 13:52.353
A-Anything you got,
he already thought about.

13:52.353 --> 13:54.659
Does that office
have any windows?

13:54.659 --> 13:55.878
- No.
- No, no.

13:55.878 --> 13:57.358
But he does have
a two-way mirror

13:57.358 --> 13:59.839
that he uses to keep an eye
on the gambling floor.

14:11.546 --> 14:13.374
This is a laser mic.
We just got them in.

14:13.374 --> 14:15.332
The sound quality
doesn't compare to wires,

14:15.332 --> 14:17.073
but it does have
one advantage--

14:17.073 --> 14:18.509
it can listen
through glass.

14:18.509 --> 14:21.164
So we won't have to wear
anything into the room?

14:21.164 --> 14:24.385
No, as long as we can
get someone close enough,

14:24.385 --> 14:26.604
we'll get full
audio surveillance.

14:29.694 --> 14:32.349
Alright. We'll set up
the meeting with Kamdar.

14:32.349 --> 14:33.568
Alright.

14:49.018 --> 14:51.934
Please. Come in.

15:06.079 --> 15:07.602
You okay?

15:09.082 --> 15:12.563
Yeah. I just don't know
how I can keep doing this.

15:12.563 --> 15:16.263
I mean, Garrett's helped me,
my family, Chris.

15:16.263 --> 15:17.917
I can't just keep
lying to him.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.571
You have to.

15:20.571 --> 15:24.575
Right now he doesn't know
we were involved.

15:24.575 --> 15:28.318
Well, he's not gonna stop until
he finds out who killed Maya.

15:28.318 --> 15:30.233
He's not going to.
Alright?

15:30.233 --> 15:33.193
We're going to
get Kamdar today.

15:33.193 --> 15:35.238
All we have to do is get him
to start talking

15:35.238 --> 15:37.501
about this drug deal
with the FBI listening in,

15:37.501 --> 15:40.243
then that'll be it.

15:40.243 --> 15:42.724
Then you can get back
to your family...

15:44.508 --> 15:46.946
...and forget
about all this.

15:48.991 --> 15:51.037
We have to be done
with this guy.

15:53.648 --> 15:54.954
Yeah.

16:03.484 --> 16:05.573
Thony and Arman should
be here any minute.

16:05.573 --> 16:07.096
This damn laser mic
better work.

16:07.096 --> 16:08.750
Relax, Miller.
It will.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.578
Hey, Denise?

16:10.578 --> 16:12.797
<i>Can you make sure that mic
is perpendicular to the glass?</i>

16:12.797 --> 16:14.103
It is.

16:14.103 --> 16:15.322
<i>Denise,
do you have a visual</i>

16:15.322 --> 16:16.888
<i>on Thony and Arman yet?</i>

16:16.888 --> 16:20.718
Affirmative. They're headed back
to Kamdar's office now.

16:20.718 --> 16:22.459
What do we do
if Kamdar says something

16:22.459 --> 16:24.026
about what happened
in the desert?

16:24.026 --> 16:25.767
We're not gonna talk
about anything but money.

16:25.767 --> 16:28.248
He still owes us our cut. We
keep the conversation focused.

16:28.248 --> 16:29.989
Get in and get out.

16:43.045 --> 16:44.829
Phones.

16:57.494 --> 16:59.844
Where's Kamdar?

16:59.844 --> 17:01.498
He's out of town.

17:04.849 --> 17:07.243
Right. Well, let's just
come back when he returns.

17:07.243 --> 17:09.419
That won't be necessary.

17:09.419 --> 17:11.900
He left me in charge,
so whatever you came to discuss

17:11.900 --> 17:13.380
with him,
you can discuss with me.

17:13.380 --> 17:15.251
Nadia, you know
I'm not gonna do that.

17:15.251 --> 17:16.861
You have no business
working for Kamdar.

17:16.861 --> 17:18.602
<i>You're doing this
just to spite me.</i>

17:18.602 --> 17:19.995
<i>Okay.</i>

17:19.995 --> 17:21.649
Is that what you want me
to report back to Robert?

17:21.649 --> 17:24.478
Nadia Morales
is involved with Kamdar?

17:24.478 --> 17:26.175
Did Thony say anything
about that?

17:26.175 --> 17:28.264
No, she didn't, but
the way that Arman sounds,

17:28.264 --> 17:29.700
he didn't know either.

17:29.700 --> 17:31.180
<i>We're just here
to get the money</i>

17:31.180 --> 17:32.921
<i>from the deal last night.</i>

17:32.921 --> 17:35.793
You mean our deal? The
one I should've been a part of?

17:35.793 --> 17:37.273
Have you forgotten?

17:37.273 --> 17:39.188
Selling your meds on
the street was <i>my</i> idea.

17:39.188 --> 17:41.103
Enough, Nadia! I said
I'm not doing this with you.

17:41.103 --> 17:42.539
Right, because you're
trying to cut me out

17:42.539 --> 17:44.106
of a business
we started together.

17:44.106 --> 17:45.673
Come on, Thony.
Let's go.

17:45.673 --> 17:47.196
Well, we did this deal
for Kamdar,

17:47.196 --> 17:48.893
but if you're in charge,
just give us our money.

17:48.893 --> 17:50.678
Thony, let's go!

17:53.202 --> 17:54.943
Thony, now!

17:57.902 --> 17:59.295
Armando!

18:02.255 --> 18:03.604
What the hell
just happened?

18:03.604 --> 18:05.997
Arman just screwed us
to protect his wife.

18:16.138 --> 18:17.705
Look, Tita Fi!

18:17.705 --> 18:20.316
Don't set up the tents yet.
We're still playing.

18:20.316 --> 18:22.579
Chill, alright? I'm just
bringing them for tonight.

18:26.105 --> 18:28.759
Oh. Um...

18:30.457 --> 18:31.588
Here.

18:31.588 --> 18:33.634
Ah! Teamwork.

18:41.294 --> 18:43.992
Uh, thanks again, JD,
for letting us stay.

18:43.992 --> 18:46.951
In between the cops coming
and the plumbing blowing,

18:46.951 --> 18:50.520
it's been...
pretty crazy, s...

18:50.520 --> 18:52.392
Glad I was able
- to help.
- Hm.

18:52.392 --> 18:55.264
But you know you could
have called me earlier.

18:55.264 --> 18:58.267
Sounds like Jaz was a little
freaked out by it all.

18:58.267 --> 19:01.792
Yeah, I-- I didn't want
to impose, you know,

19:01.792 --> 19:04.230
with your girlfriend
being here and all.

19:04.230 --> 19:06.362
W-We'll definitely
be out of your hair

19:06.362 --> 19:08.234
as soon as the plumbing
is fixed, so...

19:08.234 --> 19:09.931
No worries.

19:09.931 --> 19:12.847
Laura won't be back
until next week, so...

19:12.847 --> 19:14.196
Oh. Yeah. Um...

19:14.196 --> 19:17.504
Yeah, we'll be gone
by then, for sure.

19:19.201 --> 19:22.117
Okay.
I'm not kicking you out.

19:22.117 --> 19:24.685
It's just...

19:24.685 --> 19:28.515
Of course.
I mean, I-I totally get it.

19:30.430 --> 19:32.432
Oh. Uh, no, no.
Give me-- Give me those.

19:32.432 --> 19:34.390
But-- No!
Nope.

19:34.390 --> 19:36.131
My house, my--

19:36.131 --> 19:37.393
My house, my dishes.

19:37.393 --> 19:41.876
Okay.

19:41.876 --> 19:43.356
Really?

19:48.143 --> 19:50.450
You want to tell me what
the hell happened in there?!

19:50.450 --> 19:52.408
We had her, man,
until you screwed it up!

19:52.408 --> 19:54.889
The deal was to bring down
Kamdar, not Nadia.

19:54.889 --> 19:57.413
Look, I don't care who we have
to go through to get to Kamdar.

19:57.413 --> 19:59.850
He killed Maya,
and I'm taking him down.

19:59.850 --> 20:02.157
I'm not gonna bait my wife
to incriminate herself.

20:02.157 --> 20:05.291
Arman, the longer Kamdar
is free, the more time

20:05.291 --> 20:08.119
he has to figure out that we've
been working with the Feds.

20:08.119 --> 20:10.600
If that happens,
we're all dead.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.994
- I want to protect my family.
- And I need to protect mine.

20:12.994 --> 20:16.302
She's my wife, and you don't get
to use her to get what you want!

20:21.307 --> 20:22.743
Okay.

20:22.743 --> 20:26.790
Let's do this another way.
Without recordings.

20:26.790 --> 20:27.791
How?

20:27.791 --> 20:30.533
There's a ledger
on Kamdar's desk.

20:30.533 --> 20:32.448
What if we get
ahold of it?

20:32.448 --> 20:34.494
It's a record of who owes what,
how many points they have,

20:34.494 --> 20:36.496
and so forth,
but it's all coded.

20:36.496 --> 20:38.367
Well, you collect it
for him.

20:38.367 --> 20:41.065
You know who owes him money
and how much.

20:41.065 --> 20:43.720
You can help
- figure this out.
- Yeah, yeah.

20:43.720 --> 20:46.070
We crack that code,
follow the breadcrumbs

20:46.070 --> 20:48.247
to every criminal
and syndicate he backs.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.727
Then we can
take 'em <i>all</i> down.

20:50.727 --> 20:53.687
No, that ledger
never leaves the office.

20:55.515 --> 20:58.822
Then get Nadia's keycard
to the office.

20:58.822 --> 21:00.259
I'll do the rest.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.086
Alright. Yeah.
Do that.

21:02.086 --> 21:04.480
I can't. We're not living
together right now.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.656
She kicked me
out of the house.

21:08.789 --> 21:11.574
Then maybe
you should reconcile.

21:11.574 --> 21:14.273
It's the only way we can
protect our families.

21:16.753 --> 21:18.320
Alright.

22:03.887 --> 22:05.149
What do you want?!

22:05.149 --> 22:08.849
Come on, Nadia.
Just open the door, please.

22:08.849 --> 22:10.329
We need to talk.

22:16.509 --> 22:19.512
You want to talk?
Talk.

22:27.694 --> 22:30.349
Stop working for Kamdar.

22:30.349 --> 22:32.351
I need you to
stay away from him.

22:32.351 --> 22:33.874
Why would you care
what I do?

22:33.874 --> 22:36.746
You've got your precious Thony
to worry about, right?

22:36.746 --> 22:38.313
So go.

22:38.313 --> 22:42.012
Go take care of her and her kid
and leave me the hell alone.

22:42.012 --> 22:44.493
Look, I understand you went
to Kamdar for money

22:44.493 --> 22:45.755
'cause you had no choice.

22:45.755 --> 22:47.104
It's the reason
I'm free, alright?

22:47.104 --> 22:49.150
But now I've negotiated
a way out for us--

22:49.150 --> 22:51.761
There's no "us" anymore.

22:51.761 --> 22:55.504
You made your choice, Arman.
And it wasn't me.

22:55.504 --> 22:57.506
Oh. Don't.

22:57.506 --> 22:59.595
Remember what you told me
when we first met?

22:59.595 --> 23:01.118
You said you left him

23:01.118 --> 23:03.425
'cause you were scared,
that he was dangerous.

23:03.425 --> 23:06.689
Yeah, that was a long time ago.
I was-- I was younger then.

23:06.689 --> 23:09.910
Well, he hasn't changed.
In any case, he's gotten worse.

23:10.780 --> 23:13.174
Nadia, Robert's a brutal killer.
I've seen it.

23:13.174 --> 23:14.393
Mnh.

23:14.393 --> 23:15.829
It's not safe for you
to work for him.

23:15.829 --> 23:18.701
I'm not one of
his employees, Arman.

23:18.701 --> 23:20.747
I taught him
about sports betting,

23:20.747 --> 23:22.705
I encouraged him
to open the casino,

23:22.705 --> 23:24.968
and now
I'm running it for him. Hmm.

23:24.968 --> 23:27.188
He trusts me because
he believes in me.

23:27.188 --> 23:29.408
He's using you because
he wants to own you.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.583
Okay.
I can control Robert.

23:30.583 --> 23:32.106
Even if you could
control him,

23:32.106 --> 23:34.543
why would you want to be
with a narcissistic sociopath?

23:34.543 --> 23:36.632
And why should you care?!

23:36.632 --> 23:39.113
We're done.
You should go now.

23:43.987 --> 23:45.598
Nadia.

23:48.470 --> 23:50.080
I'm worried about you.

23:52.082 --> 23:53.780
Do you love her?

23:57.087 --> 23:58.654

Answer me that, Arman.

No.

I feel brand-new ♪

26:36.812 --> 26:39.206

26:40.729 --> 26:44.994
I bet that's
your mommy, Luca.

26:44.994 --> 26:47.562
Thony. Hi!

26:47.562 --> 26:50.957
Hey, Fi.
How are you?

26:50.957 --> 26:54.308
<i>Well, it's
pure chaos here.</i>

26:54.308 --> 26:55.701
As you can see, it's--

26:55.701 --> 26:59.182
Luca's camping for
the first time tonight.

26:59.182 --> 27:02.316
Ohh.
Oh, my.

27:02.316 --> 27:04.579
Hey. How's everything?

27:04.579 --> 27:06.712
Is there anything
I should know?

27:06.712 --> 27:08.931
Uh, no.

27:08.931 --> 27:11.368
I mean, it's-- it's quiet.

27:11.368 --> 27:13.762
It's just very quiet.

27:13.762 --> 27:15.285
But w-what about
the other stuff?

27:15.285 --> 27:18.114
I mean, are you making
any progress?

27:18.114 --> 27:21.030
Yeah.
We've been working on it.

27:21.030 --> 27:22.989
<i>I made the right call, Fi.</i>

27:25.513 --> 27:27.689
Um, hey.

27:27.689 --> 27:30.431
<i>Hi!
Hi, Mommy.</i>

27:30.431 --> 27:33.695
Hey, my love.
How are you?

27:33.695 --> 27:35.175
<i>Are you having
a good time?</i>

27:35.175 --> 27:38.134
We're all gonna sleep in a tent
in the living room.

27:38.134 --> 27:40.746
I know.
Sounds like fun!

27:40.746 --> 27:42.965
<i>When are you coming,
Mommy?</i>

27:42.965 --> 27:45.446
Um, I need to stay here
a little longer,

27:45.446 --> 27:49.668

as soon as I can, I promise.

27:49.668 --> 27:51.191
<i>Miss you, Mommy.</i>

28:39.413 --> 28:42.155
Hey, Thony?

28:55.342 --> 28:56.952
I got--

28:56.952 --> 28:59.738
Just wanted to stop by
to give you this.

29:09.225 --> 29:11.445
Look, Thony--
It's fine.

29:13.621 --> 29:15.579
Um...

29:15.579 --> 29:18.234
I'm gonna call Garrett
and tell him I'm ready.

29:20.584 --> 29:22.761
Okay. Alright.

29:23.892 --> 29:25.546
Alright.

29:26.852 --> 29:29.593
Hey, Thony, uh...

29:29.593 --> 29:31.421
Just be careful
out there.

29:31.421 --> 29:33.989
I don't know how much time
I can buy you.

29:35.512 --> 29:36.905
Alright.

30:21.341 --> 30:23.473
I know how much
you love it.

30:27.826 --> 30:29.610
It's been too long.

30:30.872 --> 30:33.266
Mm-hmm.

30:33.266 --> 30:34.833
Way too long.

30:50.022 --> 30:52.067
Okay. I got eyes on him.

31:08.997 --> 31:11.521
It worked.
I jammed his ignition.

31:11.521 --> 31:13.175
Good work, Denise.

31:14.916 --> 31:16.526
Thank you, Chan. <i>Team effort.</i>

31:16.526 --> 31:18.311
<i>Should buy us
a 10-, 15-minute window.</i>

31:18.311 --> 31:20.443
Let us know
if his position changes.

31:20.443 --> 31:23.142
<i>Garrett,
I'm almost at the back.</i>

31:23.142 --> 31:25.579
You got maybe 10 minutes.
Get in, get out.

31:45.686 --> 31:49.298
Kamdar's man is on the move.
He got a buddy to pick him up.

31:49.298 --> 31:51.213
Your girl better
make this snappy,

31:51.213 --> 31:52.475
because
if she gets caught--

31:52.475 --> 31:54.042
Alright, Thony.
Time to hustle.

31:54.042 --> 31:56.001
<i>Find us that ledger
and get out fast.</i>

31:56.001 --> 31:58.394
I'm just about in.

32:48.444 --> 32:49.445
<i>Thony.</i>

32:49.445 --> 32:50.969
I got it.
I found the ledger.

32:50.969 --> 32:53.710
No, Thony. Get out of there!
Joseph's in the building!

32:56.626 --> 32:57.801
I'm almost done.

32:57.801 --> 32:59.020
That's it.
I'm going in.

32:59.020 --> 33:00.456
No, you can't.
If Nadia sees you...

33:00.456 --> 33:02.067
Arman is keeping her distracted.

33:02.067 --> 33:04.678
What if he's not?
Can you trust him?

33:57.122 --> 33:59.037
Thony, it's me.

34:10.918 --> 34:12.050
Hi.
Hey.

34:12.050 --> 34:14.530
Did you get the photos?
Yeah.

34:19.709 --> 34:22.886
It's a lot of them.
I'll-- I'll send them to you.

34:22.886 --> 34:25.411
But, um, do you think
you can get him with this?

34:25.411 --> 34:27.413
Once we figure out
who he's been backing.

34:27.413 --> 34:30.111
We can get him on something
called criminal profiteering.

34:30.111 --> 34:31.721
Just got to
connect the dots.

34:31.721 --> 34:33.332
Okay. But when?

34:33.332 --> 34:36.204
I need to know when it's safe
for my family to come back home.

34:36.204 --> 34:38.859
As soon as we get
what we need to arrest him,

34:38.859 --> 34:40.382
I'll let you know.

34:40.382 --> 34:42.428
But we're close, Thony.

34:42.428 --> 34:45.909
And thanks to you,
your family's gonna be okay.

34:49.217 --> 34:51.350
I-I wanted
to thank you, Garrett,

34:51.350 --> 34:54.918
for everything you've done
for my family last night,

34:54.918 --> 34:56.442
especially Chris.

34:56.442 --> 35:00.924
He <i>really</i> needed
to talk to someone.

35:00.924 --> 35:06.365
I think it was good for him
to, uh, admit the truth.

35:06.365 --> 35:10.108
Fiona said that
he's doing much better,

35:10.108 --> 35:12.240
and that's thanks to you.

35:12.240 --> 35:14.938
It was, uh--
It was an accident.

35:14.938 --> 35:17.419
- He's just a kid.
- Yeah.

35:17.419 --> 35:22.294
He shouldn't have had to go
through something like that.

35:22.294 --> 35:24.209
Neither should you.

35:25.688 --> 35:28.604
What happened to Maya,
that wasn't your fault.

35:28.604 --> 35:31.564
Well, I wish
I believed that.

35:31.564 --> 35:35.742
Anyway, um, just call me
if you need anything, alright?

35:35.742 --> 35:37.787
Good work today.

35:46.622 --> 35:48.711
Come on, guys.
Wait up.

35:48.711 --> 35:51.149
No. Sorry, buddy.

35:51.149 --> 35:54.152
♪ Mmm!

35:54.152 --> 35:55.588
How do you play this?

35:55.588 --> 35:57.285
What, is it something--
something like that?

35:57.285 --> 35:59.244
- Mom! Mom, Mom! Mom!
- Hey!

35:59.244 --> 36:00.810
- What are you doing?!
- Go, Luca! Go, Luca, go!

36:00.810 --> 36:03.639
- She's helping Luca.
- I know she is!

36:03.639 --> 36:05.946
Uh, you know,
I found out last night

36:05.946 --> 36:09.471
that your son takes his
video games very seriously.

36:09.471 --> 36:11.821
- Yes, he does.
- Mom! Stop!

36:11.821 --> 36:14.868
So I suggest you come help me
with breakfast instead,

36:14.868 --> 36:16.217
especially since I know

36:16.217 --> 36:17.827
you take maple cured bacon
very seriously.

36:17.827 --> 36:20.874
Hold on. Okay. Okay.
Now you're talking my language.

36:20.874 --> 36:23.006
Yeah, go, go, go.

36:23.006 --> 36:25.879
I'm about to pass you!

36:25.879 --> 36:27.272
Hey, hey!

36:30.231 --> 36:34.061
I-I thought you needed help.

36:34.061 --> 36:36.498
Hm. I do need
your help, Fi.

36:36.498 --> 36:39.327
I need you
to tell me the truth.

36:39.327 --> 36:41.286
Wait.
What do you mean?

36:41.286 --> 36:42.548
There's another reason why

36:42.548 --> 36:44.767
Thony didn't come here
with you guys,

36:44.767 --> 36:48.249
and it's got nothing to do
with the plumbing, does it?

36:48.249 --> 36:49.685
You know Thony.

36:49.685 --> 36:51.383
She has reasons
for everything.

36:51.383 --> 36:53.515
Chris told me
the way he and Thony

36:53.515 --> 36:57.215
got out of the police station
was through an FBI agent?

36:57.215 --> 36:58.738
Did you know that?

37:02.089 --> 37:03.438
I'm sorry, JD.

37:03.438 --> 37:05.223
It's-- It's been
a heavy few weeks.

37:05.223 --> 37:06.746
I didn't want to
drag you into it.

37:06.746 --> 37:08.791
I'm sorry for what
you're going through, Fi,

37:08.791 --> 37:10.532
but I thought
after our last talk,

37:10.532 --> 37:12.969
we were gonna be honest
with each other.

37:14.275 --> 37:17.322
I know I haven't been
around much,

37:17.322 --> 37:19.019
but I'm still
Jaz's father,

37:19.019 --> 37:22.022
and I deserve to know
what's going on in her life.

37:26.461 --> 37:29.159
Thony got involved
in something, and--

37:29.159 --> 37:32.772
and now she's helping the FBI
take down a criminal.

37:32.772 --> 37:34.556
Involved how?

37:34.556 --> 37:36.341
She witnessed a crime
and--

37:36.341 --> 37:38.473
and the only way
she could protect herself

37:38.473 --> 37:39.953
was to work for them.

37:39.953 --> 37:41.694
The criminals?
Yes.

37:41.694 --> 37:45.959
But now this FBI guy started
making her work with <i>him.</i>

37:45.959 --> 37:48.091
As-- As an informant?

37:48.091 --> 37:50.398
And if the criminals find out
she's now working with the Feds,

37:50.398 --> 37:52.487
how's that gonna end up?

37:54.315 --> 37:55.577
I don't know.
That's--

37:55.577 --> 37:57.362
That's what she's
trying to figure out.

37:57.362 --> 37:58.928
Then until she does,

37:58.928 --> 38:02.410
I don't want our daughter
anywhere near Thony.

38:03.846 --> 38:06.109
That's not fair, JD.

38:06.109 --> 38:07.763
She's trying her best.

38:07.763 --> 38:09.765
She's a good mother,
and Jaz loves her,

38:09.765 --> 38:12.377
and she's the only person
who's ever been there for me

38:12.377 --> 38:14.204
every time
I've needed her.

38:14.204 --> 38:17.164
Yet she still put you
and the kids in so much danger,

38:17.164 --> 38:19.253
you had to
leave your house.

38:21.777 --> 38:23.779
You all need
to stay right here

38:23.779 --> 38:27.783
until Thony does whatever she
needs to do to make this right.

38:30.220 --> 38:33.441
But if she isn't able to...

38:33.441 --> 38:37.010
are you prepared to leave her
to protect your kids?

39:16.005 --> 39:17.703
You looking for these?

39:19.008 --> 39:20.445
Found them on the bar
when I got in.

39:20.445 --> 39:23.709
Joseph. Thank you.

39:23.709 --> 39:27.408
You're just lucky
I found them and not Robert.

39:27.408 --> 39:29.932
Yeah.
Yeah. Thank you.

39:56.045 --> 39:58.700
Your C.I. did
solid work, Miller.

39:58.700 --> 40:02.878
All of Kamdar's illegal business
transactions in that ledger.

40:02.878 --> 40:04.576
We'll have Arman help
decode some of it,

40:04.576 --> 40:07.492
but the rest should
fall into place.

40:07.492 --> 40:09.189
Yeah, not all of it.

40:12.497 --> 40:13.889
Come on, Garrett.

40:13.889 --> 40:18.285
Why don't you leave that for
Maya's family to go through?

40:18.285 --> 40:20.548
Let's grab a beer
or something.

40:20.548 --> 40:24.073
Or even dinner?
I'm buying.

40:24.073 --> 40:25.466
What the hell?

40:31.646 --> 40:33.909
- Russo, look.
- That's a location tracker.

40:33.909 --> 40:36.782
Cortes was a controlling
son of a bitch.

40:36.782 --> 40:39.393
They were tracking Maya
the whole time.

40:39.393 --> 40:42.657
That's how Kamdar
found Maya.

40:42.657 --> 40:44.354
This wasn't your fault.

40:49.490 --> 40:52.885
Look, Russo. I'm sorry
I've been such an ass.

40:56.018 --> 40:59.805
People look for someone to blame
when they're grieving.

40:59.805 --> 41:02.764
Now you know
you're not to blame.

41:02.764 --> 41:05.985
And neither are
any of our agents.

41:05.985 --> 41:09.597
So let's take the bastard down
who <i>is</i> to blame.

41:24.482 --> 41:25.831
How'd it go?

41:25.831 --> 41:28.964
I gave everything to Garrett.
Except one thing.

41:28.964 --> 41:30.705
What's that?

41:31.750 --> 41:35.493
Nadia might be in deeper
with Kamdar than you thought.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.059
What do you mean?

41:39.018 --> 41:41.542
Did you know
they were married?

41:41.542 --> 41:43.413
What are you
talking about?

41:44.545 --> 41:47.940
That's a marriage certificate
for Robert and Nadia Kamdar.

41:55.338 --> 42:00.169
Arman, I really wanted
to help you protect her, but...

42:00.169 --> 42:02.737
Luca needs me.
My family needs me.

42:02.737 --> 42:05.174
If there's no way
to take him down

42:05.174 --> 42:09.222
without her going down, too,
then... I'm sorry.
