01:14.335 --> 01:17.990
You often hear people say
things like, "Life is strange."

01:18.034 --> 01:22.038
But I don't think
it's quite as strange
as people think it is,

01:22.082 --> 01:26.651
because coincidences
are not as prevalent
as we are led to believe.

01:26.695 --> 01:30.742
Now, our time on this planet
is far more rooted

01:30.786 --> 01:33.484
in cause and effect
than any of us believe.

01:33.528 --> 01:35.791
And the ancient civilizations
knew it,

01:35.834 --> 01:38.968
conscious of
an interconnectedness
that binds us.

01:39.011 --> 01:44.452
But if we are connected,
why are we so far apart?

01:44.495 --> 01:47.368
Cause and effect?
Ones and zeroes?

01:47.411 --> 01:50.806
But what are
the ones and zeroes?
Just an invention?

01:50.849 --> 01:55.985
A means of distinguishing
between a single something
and multiple somethings?

01:56.028 --> 01:59.249
Someone had to invent numbers
to make sense of it.

01:59.293 --> 02:01.208
What if those
ancient philosophers,

02:01.251 --> 02:03.340
visionaries,
mathematicians, astronomers

02:03.384 --> 02:06.126
knew things
most of us don't know?

02:06.169 --> 02:09.825
And those things
are kept secret from us?

02:09.868 --> 02:12.697
What if we only sense
that we are bound together

02:12.741 --> 02:14.917
in this experiment
called humanity,

02:14.960 --> 02:17.180
but the real connection
is not there?

02:17.224 --> 02:19.443
What if there is
a grid of energy

02:19.487 --> 02:22.403
that stretches
from pole to pole?

02:22.446 --> 02:25.797
I've discovered that this
is the singular truth

02:25.841 --> 02:29.932
if not of this universe
then certainly of this world.

02:29.975 --> 02:33.544
The course I took
to figure it out
was an arduous one,

02:33.588 --> 02:36.721
and the twists and turns
while in the midst of them,

02:36.765 --> 02:40.725
seem to be,
as they say, strange.

02:40.769 --> 02:44.207
But such is life.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.213
Despite nearly three decades
as a public figure
of some renown,

02:50.257 --> 02:53.260
Finley Hart
remains somewhat of an enigma.

02:53.303 --> 02:55.914
Hart Enterprises
was at the forefront
of technological advances

02:55.958 --> 02:58.221
such as microprocessors,
personal computers,

02:58.265 --> 03:00.267
and the creation
of the internet,

03:00.310 --> 03:02.530
and in the 1980s,
moved their headquarters

03:02.573 --> 03:04.488
to a sprawling new campus
in Northern California.

03:04.532 --> 03:07.056
Finley Hart always considered
Hart a family business,

03:07.099 --> 03:09.798
and hired his sister Rebecca
to head up
the analytics department.

03:09.841 --> 03:14.106
In 1983,
Rebecca would introduce Finley
to Samantha Hart,

03:14.150 --> 03:16.283
a systems engineer
who would later marry...

03:16.326 --> 03:19.634
As former employees alleged,
he has a mercurial personality.

03:19.677 --> 03:22.506
Hakan Nordquist,
the Chairman of the Board
for Hart Enterprises,

03:22.550 --> 03:26.380
and close friend
of its founder,
dismisses such allegations.

03:26.423 --> 03:27.511
That's bullshit.

03:27.555 --> 03:29.339
What can I say?

03:29.383 --> 03:32.516
Okay, is Finley driven?
Absolutely.

03:32.560 --> 03:36.912
He's driven to innovate,
to move forward,
to excel, to achieve.

03:36.955 --> 03:39.306
Is he tough to work for?
Absolutely.

03:39.349 --> 03:42.091
But what boss isn't?
Thank you very much.

03:42.134 --> 03:46.008
...after renowned software
developer Samantha Hart
has passed away...

03:46.051 --> 03:47.749
Mrs. Hart had suffered
a troubled pregnancy

03:47.792 --> 03:50.273
and her son was born
six weeks premature.

03:50.317 --> 03:52.057
Though now is in
stable condition.

03:52.101 --> 03:53.842
The industry has been
rocked by news

03:53.885 --> 03:55.887
that Finley Hart
of Hart Enterprises

03:55.931 --> 03:58.107
has been ousted
from the technology firm

03:58.150 --> 04:00.283
he founded 34 years ago
in Seattle.

04:00.327 --> 04:01.980
The Hart Enterprise's
board of directors

04:02.024 --> 04:03.808
was reportedly
blindsided by news

04:03.852 --> 04:06.158
that Mr. Hart
had diverted company funds

04:06.202 --> 04:07.812
to finance a secretive project

04:07.856 --> 04:09.727
called the
Quantinuum Initiative.

04:09.771 --> 04:11.294
Details are sketchy
on just what

04:11.338 --> 04:13.253
the Quantinuum
Initiative entailed.

04:13.296 --> 04:15.255
Continued allegations
from a former developer

04:15.298 --> 04:17.692
for Hart Enterprises
who claims some familiarity

04:17.735 --> 04:19.650
with the Quantinuum Initiative.

04:19.694 --> 04:21.217
Every app he created
or financed

04:21.261 --> 04:22.827
was designed
to collect user data.

04:22.871 --> 04:25.308
The more, um, popular apps

04:25.352 --> 04:27.397
allowed Finley through
the Quantinuum Initiative

04:27.441 --> 04:29.704
to seize control
of user cameras.

04:29.747 --> 04:32.228
Ex-billionaire Finley Hart
has reportedly passed away

04:32.272 --> 04:34.099
due to complications
from kidney failure.

04:34.143 --> 04:36.319
...wife died
while giving birth in 1992,

04:36.363 --> 04:38.452
he's survived by
his sister Rebecca

04:38.495 --> 04:40.323
and his son, Samuel Hart.

04:40.367 --> 04:42.238
Again, our top story tonight,

04:42.282 --> 04:44.806
Finley Hart
is watching us no more.

06:48.103 --> 06:51.498
Mom, get up.

06:54.979 --> 06:56.459
Mom, get up.

07:00.855 --> 07:01.943
Get up.

07:03.553 --> 07:05.337
Are you just now getting home?

07:05.381 --> 07:06.991
Yes.
You can yell at me later, okay?

07:07.035 --> 07:08.689
- You have a call, remember?
- What?

07:08.732 --> 07:10.734
- Here.
- Shit.

07:24.705 --> 07:26.054
Oh...

07:40.503 --> 07:42.810
Jeez, Phil, one minute
you're swinging your dick

07:42.853 --> 07:45.334
talking about what kind
of a big shot you are,

07:45.377 --> 07:47.205
next minute
you're crying poverty.

07:47.249 --> 07:49.033
I don't think
you understand me, Trevor.

07:49.077 --> 07:50.513
My needs changed.

07:50.557 --> 07:51.949
And if you can't keep up,

07:51.993 --> 07:53.385
I will not pay the balance
of your fee.

07:53.429 --> 07:56.171
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down there, cowboy.

07:56.214 --> 08:00.958
Breathe, breathe. Okay.
You listening?

08:02.307 --> 08:04.745
- Yeah, I'm listening.
- Good.

08:04.788 --> 08:07.051
Now, we had an agreement,

08:07.095 --> 08:08.966
and in that agreement
was a deadline.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.925
Now you asked me
to do you a favor.

08:10.968 --> 08:13.884
- Look, I don't need a recap.
- Well, you're getting one.

08:13.928 --> 08:17.627
Now, in that favor, you asked us
to move the deadline.

08:17.671 --> 08:20.543
Now, I'll meet that deadline.

08:20.587 --> 08:24.808
If you got some personal issues
that left you cash-strapped,
look, I feel for you, bro,

08:24.852 --> 08:29.421
but if you think that you can
demand that I finish tonight,

08:29.465 --> 08:31.423
and threaten
to withhold my funds

08:31.467 --> 08:34.165
because you think
I'm some kind of nerd

08:34.209 --> 08:36.080
that you hired off
of monster.com,

08:36.124 --> 08:38.430
you got another thing coming,
my friend.

08:38.474 --> 08:41.303
I can't move the deadline.
Again.

08:41.346 --> 08:43.000
And may I ask why?

08:46.613 --> 08:49.877
Yes, you may, Phil,
because it's date night.

09:04.326 --> 09:05.893
- Good morning, Ms. Schultz!
- Morning.

09:05.936 --> 09:08.373
- How are you today?
- Next time you schedule

09:08.417 --> 09:11.420
a conference call
at the crack of dawn for me

09:11.463 --> 09:13.074
my hourly rate will double.

09:13.117 --> 09:15.772
Haven't you heard?
In early risings,

09:15.816 --> 09:17.687
there are blessings
and success?

09:17.731 --> 09:20.821
I need to make one thing
clear and understood

09:20.864 --> 09:23.127
before the others hop on.

09:23.867 --> 09:25.652
I work for you.

09:25.695 --> 09:28.132
I want the deal
that works for you.

09:28.176 --> 09:30.700
- Certainly.
- However, I will not be

09:30.744 --> 09:32.789
- dragged into any kind of--
- I would not drag you

09:32.833 --> 09:36.140
into anything that you
did not feel comfortable.

09:36.184 --> 09:38.795
Let me finish.
On the call yesterday,

09:38.839 --> 09:42.320
you second-guessed me
and it makes us both look bad.

09:43.278 --> 09:44.584
I am the attorney.

09:44.627 --> 09:46.194
If I make a suggestion

09:46.237 --> 09:49.023
it's with
your best interest in mind.

09:49.066 --> 09:52.592
I understand.
I regret that I let my temper
get the better of me.

09:52.635 --> 09:55.029
- Good.
- You have my assurances
this will not happen again.

09:55.072 --> 09:57.945
So say it.
I need you to say it.

09:57.988 --> 10:01.862
Say, "Veronica,
you're the attorney. I'm not."

10:01.905 --> 10:05.039
Veronica, you are the attorney.
I am not.

10:06.344 --> 10:07.563
Thank you.

10:07.607 --> 10:09.826
- Was that so difficult?

10:40.901 --> 10:42.816
Uh, Schultz, are you with us?

10:42.859 --> 10:44.731
I never agreed to that,
and I never will!

10:44.774 --> 10:46.820
Can you get your client
to stop yelling?

10:46.863 --> 10:48.386
- I'm not yelling.
- Ms. Schultz?

10:48.430 --> 10:50.562
Look, I'm a nice guy.
I'm not trying to--

10:50.606 --> 10:51.912
Gentlemen, stop, I'm sorry.

10:51.955 --> 10:53.478
We'll have to
pick this up later.

10:53.522 --> 10:56.264
I have to deal with a matter
of urgent concern.

11:09.799 --> 11:10.800
Yeah?

Who is it?

13:05.567 --> 13:07.351
Urgent enough
to skip out on this?

13:07.395 --> 13:08.613
Apparently so.

13:08.657 --> 13:10.267
Look, just hang out there,

13:10.311 --> 13:11.921
it shouldn't take long.

13:28.895 --> 13:32.028
Well, I'll be waiting for you.

13:33.116 --> 13:34.770
I can't wait to see you.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.512
I can't wait to see you, too.

13:47.652 --> 13:50.220
Hey, babe. How you doing?

13:50.264 --> 13:53.049
Good. I just got here and my mom
is already driving me nuts.

Oh, you know what?
I'm doing good. I'm doing good.

Somebody put it up, babe.
It wasn't me.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.899
It wasn't me, either.

14:16.943 --> 14:19.423
You said you wanted
to see him again, so I--

14:19.467 --> 14:22.557
- Yeah, so I could tell him
what a shit dad he was.

14:22.600 --> 14:24.559
Oh, I thought he was
down for the night.

14:25.690 --> 14:27.388

Well, uh,
science is not creative, is it?

15:35.021 --> 15:38.981
It's, uh, rigid fact-based,

15:39.025 --> 15:41.984
uh, but art, by its very nature,
is, uh, creatively-based.

15:42.028 --> 15:44.421
And, uh,
what is creativity?

15:44.465 --> 15:47.598
Well, oftentimes, creativity
is about connection, is it not?

15:47.642 --> 15:51.776
I mean, take for instance this,
uh, ubiquitous thing.

15:51.820 --> 15:55.650
Uh, the first cell phone
simply connected two,

15:55.693 --> 16:01.743
uh, specific ideas, uh,
or the existing ideas,
the phone and radio waves.

16:01.786 --> 16:05.355
And later, the internet
and the cell phones

16:05.399 --> 16:07.531
led to the creation
of the smart phone.

16:07.575 --> 16:10.795
And, uh, the functioning
of these devices

16:10.839 --> 16:14.016

you know,
information technology,
et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

16:16.584 --> 16:21.632

to be a part
of the reactivation plan.

18:23.232 --> 18:26.583
You're talking about
that machine, aren't you?

18:26.627 --> 18:31.284
Yes. Step one of
the reactivation protocol
has been completed.

18:31.327 --> 18:36.115
What? Who--
who reactivated it?

18:36.158 --> 18:38.291
The purpose of this call
is not to ascertain

18:38.334 --> 18:40.858
who took the initial step
towards reactivation,

18:40.902 --> 18:42.773
but to complete
the reactivation

18:42.817 --> 18:45.994
and therefore allow the machine
to become fully functional.

18:46.037 --> 18:48.214
What is
the Quantinuum Initiative?

18:48.257 --> 18:49.911
It doesn't matter what it is.

18:49.954 --> 18:51.565
We were given
explicit information

18:51.608 --> 18:53.132
and instruction what we should--

18:53.175 --> 18:55.873
- No-- It matters to me.
- Why?

18:55.917 --> 18:58.659
Maybe I met you at the funeral
or the visitation, okay?

18:58.702 --> 19:00.139
Maybe I met all of you.

19:00.182 --> 19:01.705
But I don't know any of you

19:01.749 --> 19:03.403
and I certainly
didn't know Finley.

19:03.446 --> 19:05.622
All I know is he lost control
of Hart Enterprises.

19:05.666 --> 19:08.451
So, you'll excuse me
if I wanna know

19:08.495 --> 19:10.932
a little bit more of why
the hell we're all here.

19:10.975 --> 19:12.890
I mean, you clearly
all know each other.

19:12.934 --> 19:14.936
I don't know any of these people
except the counselor.

19:14.979 --> 19:17.547
Okay, we all worked for your
father in various capacities

19:17.591 --> 19:20.028
over a span of maybe 20 years.

19:20.071 --> 19:22.248
Our paths may
have crossed but no,

19:22.291 --> 19:24.075
we are not well acquainted.

19:24.119 --> 19:25.555
Yeah, were you
a part of his ouster?

19:25.599 --> 19:26.991
Were any of you?

19:27.035 --> 19:29.733
I voted in favor
of keeping him.

19:29.777 --> 19:32.649
And then I was let go.

19:34.260 --> 19:36.349
- He was a good man.
- If you say so.

19:36.392 --> 19:40.353
So, what the hell
is the Quantinuum Project?

19:40.396 --> 19:42.485
It's fringe science, Sam.

19:42.529 --> 19:44.966
Alien contact, micro-technology,

19:45.009 --> 19:46.837
artificial intelligence,
alien technology.

19:46.881 --> 19:48.883
As I understand,
the biggest breakthroughs

19:48.926 --> 19:51.320
were in displacement technology.

19:51.364 --> 19:54.758
You mean like moving objects?
Like teleportation?

19:54.802 --> 19:58.458
Exactly. Teleportation,
moving objects, people.

19:58.501 --> 20:01.200
And, well, while Ms. Schultz
is correct to say

20:01.243 --> 20:04.638
that the Quantinuum Initiative
saw the biggest breakthrough

20:04.681 --> 20:06.814
in the field
of displacement technology,

20:06.857 --> 20:10.252
it was also where we experienced
our biggest controversies.

20:10.296 --> 20:14.909
The central aspect
of the project was the machine,

20:14.952 --> 20:18.086
a device your father
developed in secret.

20:19.827 --> 20:22.395
Which theoretically would power
the technology we created.

20:22.438 --> 20:24.135
Looks like somebody
didn't know pops

20:24.179 --> 20:26.703
was into some weird shit, huh?

20:26.747 --> 20:29.967
We need to get on with this.
Our instructions from Finley
were clear and--

20:30.011 --> 20:31.404
We're missing someone.

20:32.666 --> 20:36.278
Hakan, are you still with us?

20:39.716 --> 20:42.415
Some lunatic is staring
right into my window.

20:42.458 --> 20:45.026
Is it a chick pissed off
at you or a guy?

20:45.069 --> 20:47.724
- Mr. Williams--
- Hey, I'm not judging.

20:47.768 --> 20:49.117
Do you know him?

20:49.160 --> 20:52.947
I don't know.

20:52.990 --> 20:54.470
There's something strange
with his face.

20:56.080 --> 20:59.127
He's, uh, dizzy.

20:59.170 --> 21:00.302
Did you say dizzy?

21:00.346 --> 21:03.740
Yeah, he's like, um, drunk.

21:05.699 --> 21:08.310
Hey...

21:08.354 --> 21:09.572
Look at the lawyer
getting jumpy.

21:22.716 --> 21:24.413
I'm sorry. I'm back.

21:25.501 --> 21:27.198
Can we go on with this now?

21:27.242 --> 21:28.722
I have a tight schedule today.

21:28.765 --> 21:31.246
Oh, yeah, me, too.
But what you doing?

21:31.290 --> 21:33.640
Well, that's none
of your business.

21:33.683 --> 21:36.033
Host, can you please guide us
through the procedure?

21:36.077 --> 21:38.906
My pleasure.
Each of you should have
received a password.

21:38.949 --> 21:40.908
You were told
to keep this password safe.

21:40.951 --> 21:43.214
At this time,
please locate your password

21:43.258 --> 21:45.260
and enjoy some music
while you wait.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.349
This is one
of Finley Hart's favorites.

21:47.393 --> 21:49.046
I hope you enjoy it.

21:51.179 --> 21:55.314

how weird Finley could be.

God, I love this song.

22:03.234 --> 22:04.627
You okay, Veronica?

22:05.498 --> 22:07.369
I'm fine.

22:07.413 --> 22:10.459
Uh, sorry, uh...
I'll be right back.

22:10.503 --> 22:12.026
Me, too.

22:13.157 --> 22:15.638
Ego. No.

22:15.682 --> 22:17.510
But you have been labeled.

22:17.553 --> 22:20.121
I have? Oh, God, I'll be.

22:20.164 --> 22:22.689
Oh, I hope not.

22:22.732 --> 22:26.388
Um, labels--
labels are so boring,
don't you think?

22:26.432 --> 22:30.218
I mean, you know,
labels are the, um, uh,

22:30.261 --> 22:33.003
the lazy people--
no, shall I say person?

22:33.047 --> 22:36.877
The lazy person's way of,
uh, reducing the more
industrious person

22:36.920 --> 22:39.445
to a-- a singular essence,
so to speak.

22:39.488 --> 22:41.403
Or to a particular
character trait,
uh, you know, I'm saying?

22:41.447 --> 22:44.406
Um, because, uh,
in my experience,

22:44.450 --> 22:48.584
um, the persons I've met
or dealt with, um,

22:48.628 --> 22:51.065
is far more complex,
far more complicated

22:51.108 --> 22:52.501
than let's say, um--

22:52.545 --> 22:54.982
Oh, I don't know,

23:30.147 --> 23:31.322
Shit.

23:37.241 --> 23:39.983
- Are we sure about this?
- Sure about what part?

23:40.027 --> 23:41.942
You were Finley's,
what, IT guy?

23:41.985 --> 23:44.640
Uh, it's a tad more
complicated than that, dude.

23:44.684 --> 23:46.033
Well, so--
so walk me through it.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.036
All right.

23:49.079 --> 23:50.690
You ever heard of
distributed ledger technology?

23:50.733 --> 23:52.779
Blockchains, sure.
Yeah, I'm familiar.

23:52.822 --> 23:54.563
You know, I--
I started with your dad--

23:54.607 --> 23:57.305
When did Finley
start this thing,
the Quantinuum Project?

23:57.348 --> 23:58.654
What, officially?

23:58.698 --> 24:00.874
He talked about it for years.

24:00.917 --> 24:02.310
I met him in grad school.

24:02.353 --> 24:04.355
He was giving a lecture at MIT.

24:04.399 --> 24:07.663
Said he came up with it
when his wife passed away.

24:07.707 --> 24:11.580
- So '92?

24:11.624 --> 24:15.541
Yeah. I mean, he went all
over the world to find funding.

24:15.584 --> 24:19.153
But he made it official
when he finished the lab
in 2008.

24:19.196 --> 24:22.156
No, no, no, 2009. Yeah.

24:22.199 --> 24:26.595
- Um, did you read this letter?
- We all read it.

24:26.639 --> 24:29.424
And it doesn't scare
the shit out of any of you?

24:29.468 --> 24:31.470
You don't trust
your father, do you?

24:31.513 --> 24:33.297
I don't have a father.

24:33.341 --> 24:35.691
Finley's, um,
he's a guy to me.

24:35.735 --> 24:37.954
Ah... You're a lot like him.

24:37.998 --> 24:40.740
I'm surprised his crazy ass
found five people he trusted.

24:40.783 --> 24:44.613
Well, I knew him well,
and I trust him implicitly.

24:46.006 --> 24:48.051
And don't call him crazy.

24:48.095 --> 24:51.402
So, you--
you know him so well,

24:51.446 --> 24:53.840
what's your best theory
on why he made me proxy?

24:53.883 --> 24:57.583
Mr. Hart,
I know that your father
died with deep regret

24:57.626 --> 25:01.412
that he didn't make
more of an effort to develop
a relationship with you.

25:01.456 --> 25:03.371
Yeah. I bet he did.

25:06.374 --> 25:09.072
Hey, just for the record,
I meant a good crazy, like,

25:09.116 --> 25:11.205
- Finley, you crazy bastard.
- Sorry, I'm back.

25:11.248 --> 25:12.815
- Oh, great.
- Yeah, let's just
get on with this.

25:12.859 --> 25:14.513
I couldn't agree more.

of the procedure?

their secure password?

25:21.824 --> 25:23.739
- Yes.
- Excellent.

25:23.783 --> 25:25.828
At the bottom of the letter,
you will find the address

25:25.872 --> 25:27.569

Ooh, gross.

26:57.180 --> 26:58.312
What did he say?

27:00.009 --> 27:01.620
He said that
asshole puked in the street.

27:01.663 --> 27:03.491
That's exactly what I said.

27:04.840 --> 27:07.495
What? I did a gap year
in Sweden.

27:09.976 --> 27:11.673
What's he doing?

27:11.717 --> 27:13.109
Wait.

27:15.938 --> 27:17.070
Hakan?

27:22.510 --> 27:24.904
He's gone.

27:24.947 --> 27:26.688
- What do you mean gone?

27:28.255 --> 27:30.431
Hakan! Hakan?

28:36.453 --> 28:38.151
Dude's been gone
for five minutes.

28:38.194 --> 28:40.153
Maybe he's getting
second thoughts.

28:40.196 --> 28:42.242
Why would he
be having second thoughts?

28:42.285 --> 28:43.547
- Shut up, Mr. Williams.
- No, answer my question.

28:43.591 --> 28:46.159
He wouldn't be
getting second thoughts.

28:46.202 --> 28:48.857
Mr. Hart, you'll have to
forgive Mr. Williams.

28:48.901 --> 28:50.511
During his time
with Hart Enterprises,

28:50.554 --> 28:52.034
Mr. Williams thought it wise

28:52.078 --> 28:53.644
to supplement his income

28:53.688 --> 28:55.690
as a sort of hacker for hire.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.518
False. I never
thought it was wise.

28:57.561 --> 28:59.389
In any event,
his actions created significant

28:59.433 --> 29:01.870
liability issues
for Hart Enterprises,

29:01.914 --> 29:05.352
and I was surprised your father
invited him back a year later.

29:05.395 --> 29:08.007
Yeah. Invited me back,
and trusted me with this.

29:08.050 --> 29:09.269
Does that surprise you, too?

29:09.312 --> 29:10.836
Surprise isn't
strong enough a word.

29:10.879 --> 29:12.402
Jesus. I get it.

29:12.446 --> 29:14.970
Why would Hakan
be having second thoughts?

29:15.014 --> 29:16.406
He wouldn't.

29:19.192 --> 29:22.412
You're insinuating
or suggesting that, um...

29:23.544 --> 29:26.242
a person can be, uh,

29:26.286 --> 29:29.158
labeled in many ways,
is that right?

29:29.202 --> 29:32.466
- Correct.
- Is that correct? It is, okay.

29:32.509 --> 29:34.816
Wow. Golly gosh.
I'm sorry, old sport,

29:34.860 --> 29:37.601
I had no idea
because, you know,
my ego is far too big,

29:37.645 --> 29:42.215
far too, um, fragile to,
uh, read my paper clippings.

29:42.258 --> 29:44.783
And, um, it's a habit
I kicked 30 years ago.

29:44.826 --> 29:47.524
But what I do know about,
uh, people or persons

29:47.568 --> 29:50.789
is that, uh, whatever they say
about me, is that, um,

29:50.832 --> 29:54.053
it's either, um,
excessive praise,

29:54.096 --> 29:57.143
which borders on sycophancy,
or just, uh,

29:57.186 --> 29:59.972
venomous denunciation
which borders on,

30:00.015 --> 30:02.801
uh, um, slander, you know?

30:07.588 --> 30:10.286
The machine runs on
dark matter reactor.

30:12.636 --> 30:16.989
M-- Meaning that its power
source interacts with gravity?

30:17.032 --> 30:19.861
Yes, fundamentally,
but Finley found a way

30:19.905 --> 30:21.950
to capture it
in a tachyon field.

30:21.994 --> 30:24.605
A tachyon field?
How does it stabilize?

30:24.648 --> 30:26.520
I don't know
what any of that means, but--

30:26.563 --> 30:29.218
The tachyon field
must remain intact

30:29.262 --> 30:33.092
or the anti-matter could expand
starting this-- this-- this
chain reaction.

30:33.135 --> 30:36.269
That could cause a worldwide
electromagnetic event.

30:36.312 --> 30:41.883
Yeah. Which could, in turn,
sheer the-- the electromagnetic
shield around the planet

30:41.927 --> 30:45.017
allowing these massive amounts
of solar and cosmic radiation

30:45.060 --> 30:48.063
to-- to-- to scorch
the surface of the earth.

30:50.587 --> 30:52.676
Oh, is that all?

30:52.720 --> 30:55.897
Riku, is that true?

30:57.725 --> 30:59.466
It's true.

31:01.294 --> 31:02.861
That's a possibility, yes.

31:02.904 --> 31:05.037
It was.

31:05.080 --> 31:08.083
It was a source of much debate
within the Initiative.

31:09.911 --> 31:12.871
And when the board
discovered that
Finley was doing--

31:12.914 --> 31:14.350
They ousted him.

31:15.612 --> 31:17.527
Yeah.

31:17.571 --> 31:19.747
And all the stuff
that made the news,

31:19.790 --> 31:21.662
and diversions of funds and--

31:21.705 --> 31:23.272
It was itself a diversion.

31:25.361 --> 31:28.887
You now have
53 minutes to input the--

31:28.930 --> 31:30.062
Hey, guys,

31:30.105 --> 31:32.238
we're not alone
on this call.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.632
- What?
- Yup.

31:35.676 --> 31:37.808
Yeah, someone tapped
into the line.

31:37.852 --> 31:39.941
How-- how come
we-- we can't see them?

31:39.985 --> 31:44.598
- It's, uh--
look, I can't explain it.
- Well, give it a go.

31:44.641 --> 31:46.948
Well, can you sum up
contract law in five seconds

31:46.992 --> 31:48.602
in a way I can understand?

31:48.645 --> 31:51.170
You sign a contract,
you abide by it.

31:53.302 --> 31:55.043
Okay, bad example.

31:55.087 --> 31:57.219
Can you tell where they--
they are?

31:57.263 --> 32:01.920
No. No, but whoever it is,
they're really good.

32:01.963 --> 32:03.922
- They're really--

32:05.271 --> 32:07.447
Is that Hakan?

32:07.490 --> 32:08.839
Hakan?

32:08.883 --> 32:10.972
I don't know.

32:11.016 --> 32:14.019
It appears that Mr. Nordquist
has disconnected.

32:14.062 --> 32:16.543
- Please enjoy this music
until he's back online.

32:16.586 --> 32:18.240
Hey, you guys,
that was not Hakan.

32:18.284 --> 32:20.286
- You don't know that!
- Is the song necessary?

32:20.329 --> 32:21.722
- Not at all.

32:31.514 --> 32:34.213
Riku, what--
what are you doing? Riku.

32:34.256 --> 32:35.475
Wait, just give me a minute.

32:35.518 --> 32:37.564
Jesus, this is absurd.

32:43.222 --> 32:45.441
- Hello.
- Hey, Doug. It's me.

32:45.485 --> 32:46.965
Me, who?

32:47.008 --> 32:48.357
Riku Matsuda.

32:49.358 --> 32:51.317
Sorry.

32:51.360 --> 32:53.319
When's the last time
you checked on the equipment?

32:55.234 --> 32:57.845
Riku, the equipment is safe.

32:57.888 --> 33:01.892
It's locked up,
I have eyes on it 24/7

33:01.936 --> 33:03.416
I need you to check it!

33:03.459 --> 33:04.721
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

33:04.765 --> 33:06.419
Who do you
think you're talking to?

33:06.462 --> 33:11.032
Sorry. I'm on a call with
the Quantinuum Contingency team.

33:11.076 --> 33:13.295
Okay. Who are they?

33:13.339 --> 33:16.255
I say the rest of us
input our codes
and be done with it.

33:16.298 --> 33:18.822
- Hey, do we still
have a visitor?
- Yup.

33:18.866 --> 33:20.520
Okay, so,
any luck figuring out

33:20.563 --> 33:22.478
where they are,
who they are?

33:23.740 --> 33:25.916
Oh, I was supposed to
do that, huh?

33:25.960 --> 33:27.701
- Well--
- Couldn't hurt, could it?

33:33.533 --> 33:35.535
It's coming from
inside the house.

33:37.928 --> 33:40.322
Just kidding.

33:40.366 --> 33:43.543
Can you please
just check the equipment?

33:48.417 --> 33:49.897
Come on,
I'll take you over there.

33:49.940 --> 33:51.638
Jump onto FaceTime.

33:51.681 --> 33:52.856
Mr. Matsuda.

33:53.857 --> 33:55.381
In a minute.

33:55.424 --> 33:57.557
Well, as you would say nowadays,

33:57.600 --> 34:02.040
um, it's all truth-adjacent,
shall we say,

34:02.083 --> 34:04.172
or is it adjacent-truth?
I'm not sure.

34:04.216 --> 34:05.695
But it's bit
of a conundrum, isn't it?

34:05.739 --> 34:07.741
The point is
that none of these,

34:07.784 --> 34:09.960
uh, the fealty and obeisance,

34:10.004 --> 34:12.398
uh, thrown my way
has anything to with me,

34:12.441 --> 34:14.356
but with my achievements.

34:14.400 --> 34:16.967
And while there may be, uh,
kernels or seeds of truth

34:17.011 --> 34:20.406
in, um, these, uh, allegations

34:20.449 --> 34:24.062
or these accolades
or castigations,

34:24.105 --> 34:26.716
um, no, I'm-- I'm sorry.

34:26.760 --> 34:30.068
None of these define
exactly who I am.

34:34.420 --> 34:35.725
All right.

35:04.406 --> 35:05.451
No, no, no.

35:05.494 --> 35:06.887
What is it?

35:06.930 --> 35:08.323
Call the Foundation.

35:09.585 --> 35:11.718
- Why?
- It's not here.

35:11.761 --> 35:13.111
Call the Foundation,
right now.

35:14.024 --> 35:15.809
Riku, it's gone.

35:15.852 --> 35:17.332
It's empty. Look, it's empty.

35:39.224 --> 35:42.140
Sorry. Is Hakan back?

35:42.183 --> 35:44.142
- Negative.
- What are you doing?

35:44.185 --> 35:46.448
I'm calling the Foundation.

35:46.492 --> 35:47.841
What's the Foundation?

35:47.884 --> 35:49.364
The Foundation oversees

35:49.408 --> 35:51.975
- remaining corporate interests.
- Shit! No answer.

35:52.019 --> 35:55.979
It's not a place of business.
They don't have working hours.

35:56.023 --> 35:59.244
Well, I thought
it was worth a shot.

35:59.287 --> 36:01.246
And you made a valiant effort,

36:01.289 --> 36:03.248
but we should have already
entered our passcodes.

36:03.291 --> 36:04.466
Guys, I'll be right back.

36:20.569 --> 36:22.441
What the hell is this?

37:06.528 --> 37:07.877
Sorry about earlier.

37:08.965 --> 37:11.533
If you say so,
Mr. Williams.

37:11.577 --> 37:13.883
Look, me and Finley,
we're tight.
You knew that.

37:13.927 --> 37:18.801
So were you really surprised
that I was one of,
uh, the chosen?

37:18.845 --> 37:22.544
Mr. Williams,
you put the company at jeopardy

37:22.588 --> 37:25.243
with your erratic behavior
and your dependence issues.

37:25.286 --> 37:26.244
Right.

37:27.549 --> 37:29.116
What time is it there again?

37:30.509 --> 37:32.206
What if we punch in our codes?

37:32.250 --> 37:33.816
Give it a whirl, sure.

37:37.342 --> 37:38.995
Access denied.

37:39.039 --> 37:40.345
It's case sensitive.

37:40.388 --> 37:42.172
You really are insufferable.

37:42.216 --> 37:43.783
Still no answer
at the Foundation.

37:45.350 --> 37:47.265
Access denied.

37:48.353 --> 37:49.876
May I ask why?

37:49.919 --> 37:52.008
When one or more
Contingency members

37:52.052 --> 37:55.316
are signed, the system
will automatically lock down.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.318
To override
the system lockdown,

37:57.362 --> 38:01.235
please enter the 20-character
secure override password.

38:01.279 --> 38:04.891
- Any ideas, Trevor?
- Twenty characters?

38:04.934 --> 38:07.981
Might have to
think on that a minute.

38:08.024 --> 38:11.332
You have 50 minutes
to input the codes.

38:11.376 --> 38:13.595
Would you like to listen
to music while you wait?

38:13.639 --> 38:16.598
No. No, no, no.
We would not.

38:18.165 --> 38:20.036
What on earth
are you laughing at?

38:20.080 --> 38:23.344
Nothing. It's--
this is so Finley.

38:25.825 --> 38:28.088
"You will receive
a message on this phone.

38:28.131 --> 38:30.743
Start the video
attached to the message."

38:32.788 --> 38:34.790
Hey, it's me.

38:34.834 --> 38:37.358
So, anything?

38:37.402 --> 38:39.055
There's no sign of forced entry.

38:39.099 --> 38:41.231
And the outside alarm
wasn't triggered,

38:41.275 --> 38:45.627
so whoever it was
had the passcode
to my entire security system.

38:47.237 --> 38:48.500
Wait a second.

38:55.985 --> 38:59.772
"Your legacy is yours
and yours alone."

39:05.778 --> 39:08.607
Hey, counselor,
I'm really sorry
to change the subject

39:08.650 --> 39:11.305
because I love talking about
what a piece of shit I am,

39:11.349 --> 39:14.482
but I'm tracking this,
uh, secret caller...

39:17.224 --> 39:19.139
And?

39:19.182 --> 39:21.184
I'm getting pinballed
all over the world here.

39:21.228 --> 39:25.537
Hawaii, New York, Little Rock,
Dallas, Texas. No, wait--

39:25.580 --> 39:28.888
Dallas, Georgia.
Did you guys know
there was a Dallas, Georgia?

39:28.931 --> 39:31.369
Mr. Williams.

39:31.412 --> 39:33.849
Right, right.
So, look, the point is

39:33.893 --> 39:37.070
right when I think I'm gonna
pin him down, I get rerouted.

39:38.201 --> 39:39.594
What is it?

39:39.638 --> 39:41.291
Riku, I'm gonna
send you something...

39:42.945 --> 39:45.078
...and you better
get a handle on it.

39:45.121 --> 39:47.036
Call the Foundation.
Do it now.

39:47.080 --> 39:49.430
- I did.
- Keep trying
until you get through.

39:54.217 --> 39:55.567
Oh, shit.

39:58.700 --> 40:02.095
- Make the call. Do it now.
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

40:02.138 --> 40:03.575
- Oh, shit.
- What?

40:03.618 --> 40:06.099
Did you know there was
a Los Angeles in Chile?

40:08.144 --> 40:11.452
And rerouted again.
Goddamnit.

40:13.498 --> 40:17.371
Oh, great. I was worried
I missed something.

40:17.415 --> 40:18.807
Hakan's back up.

40:25.553 --> 40:27.512
- Hey!

40:29.644 --> 40:32.212
Forty-eight minutes remaining.

40:43.397 --> 40:45.355
I'm not even gonna ask
what that was.

40:45.399 --> 40:47.270
I think we should do
what it says.

40:47.314 --> 40:49.969
- Abort mission. Game over.
- I couldn't agree more.

40:50.012 --> 40:52.014
- Thank you.
- We can't.

40:52.058 --> 40:54.364
- We made a commitment.
- Commitment?

40:54.408 --> 40:56.366
Commitment my ass,
Veronica.

40:56.410 --> 41:00.719
No one, I mean, no one
short of Finley Hart himself
can convince me--

41:00.762 --> 41:02.677
We can't punch the code
in anyway.

41:02.721 --> 41:03.722
Why not?

41:03.765 --> 41:05.375
Because the system locks down.

41:05.419 --> 41:08.553
Locks down tight,
requires 20-character password.

41:08.596 --> 41:10.424
Wait, so--
so can you hack it?

41:10.468 --> 41:13.862
Not in the 47 minutes
we have.

41:13.906 --> 41:17.823
Trevor, uh,
I know you were loyal to Finley.

41:17.866 --> 41:21.087
And I was, too.
He-- he taught me everything.

41:21.130 --> 41:23.611
Everything I know,
but we also--

41:23.655 --> 41:27.746
we also need to bear in mind
that he-- he was bat-shit crazy.

41:27.789 --> 41:29.661
He taught you
everything you know,

41:29.704 --> 41:32.011
but he didn't teach you
everything he knew.

41:32.054 --> 41:36.755
He chose you and you accepted,
so we are not aborting

41:36.798 --> 41:40.149
and don't call him
bat-shit crazy.

41:40.193 --> 41:42.412
Why is it that today we are--

41:42.456 --> 41:45.198
nowadays we are,
uh, compelled and--

41:45.241 --> 41:49.071
to use these big, big words
like the truth, the narrative,

41:49.115 --> 41:51.117
and, uh, you know, the optics.

41:51.160 --> 41:55.556
Ooh. And, uh, why are we so--
we are-- why do we all

41:55.600 --> 41:59.691
so desperately
need to be defined?

41:59.734 --> 42:02.432
Can you tell me?
Because it sure as hell

42:02.476 --> 42:05.131
beats the crap out of me, kiddo,
I'll tell you that.

42:05.174 --> 42:07.699
Anyway, never mind,
it's no problem.

42:07.742 --> 42:10.615
Um, you know, for all
my faults, I just, uh--

42:10.658 --> 42:12.791
simply I wanna make people
better or just,

42:12.834 --> 42:15.315
you know--
not even those around me.

42:15.358 --> 42:17.578
Anyway, thank you
for a wonderful interview.

42:17.622 --> 42:19.275
I really have to go
'cause I'm rather tired.

42:19.319 --> 42:21.147
See, I don't have long
to live, you see?

42:21.190 --> 42:22.888
But none of us do, do we?

42:22.931 --> 42:25.760
But then life is a blur,
isn't it, you know?

42:25.804 --> 42:28.197
Yeah.

42:28.241 --> 42:31.070
That's right, an illusion.
A dream within a dream.

42:31.113 --> 42:33.725
Strange twists,
uneasy turns in the road.

42:33.768 --> 42:37.424
Ah, yes, and another thing,
I'll tell you this for--
for free.

42:37.467 --> 42:41.776
Um, there are
far too many people
in that final turn in the road.

42:41.820 --> 42:43.212
You know what I mean?

42:43.256 --> 42:45.519
Far too many people
who are about to realize

42:45.563 --> 42:48.914
quite suddenly
and only too late, I'm afraid,

42:48.957 --> 42:51.394
that they're about to hit
the fucking wall.

42:51.438 --> 42:53.222
And that nobody cares.

42:53.266 --> 42:57.009
And nobody ever has cared
in the whole of human history.

42:57.052 --> 43:00.273
It's so strange-- strange
little creatures we are.

43:02.188 --> 43:06.714
All right. What good would it do
to contact the Foundation?

43:06.758 --> 43:08.498
Maybe they're aware
of the breach

43:08.542 --> 43:11.284
and can pinpoint the source.

43:12.677 --> 43:14.635
Why did this person
bring Hakan back online?

43:14.679 --> 43:16.637
We couldn't punch in the codes.
He could have stopped us.

43:16.681 --> 43:17.943
Yeah, no shit.

43:17.986 --> 43:21.511
My-- my guess is it's because...

43:21.555 --> 43:25.733
Okay...

43:25.777 --> 43:28.170
- Remember what I said earlier?
- Sort of.

43:28.214 --> 43:29.868
Yeah, the electromagnetic event.

43:29.911 --> 43:35.787
- Yeah, that.
- There's also the possibility

43:35.830 --> 43:41.444
that not inputting the codes
will destabilize the field.

43:41.488 --> 43:44.012
Wait. So the same thing
as putting the--

43:44.056 --> 43:46.624
No. Not-- not exactly
because the power source

43:46.667 --> 43:50.671
has been partially reactivated.

43:50.715 --> 43:54.283
So the theory goes,
it is already expanding

43:54.327 --> 43:58.766
and could fracture
the temporal continuum.

44:00.463 --> 44:04.642
The tem...
the temporal continuum?

44:06.469 --> 44:09.342
Like, reset
the space-time continuum?

44:09.385 --> 44:11.126
I mean, start over.

44:11.170 --> 44:12.998
Back to the Ice Ages,
so to speak.

44:13.041 --> 44:14.608
Jesus.

44:17.872 --> 44:20.005
I mean, it's not a theory
I agree with.

44:20.048 --> 44:23.530
- Hold on.
Forty-five minutes remaining.

44:23.573 --> 44:26.620
I have another number
for the Foundation, Riku.
Try this.

44:28.143 --> 44:31.190
What? Why didn't you
tell us that earlier?

44:31.233 --> 44:33.105
Because I don't
trust any of you.

44:33.148 --> 44:35.498
Okay, I'm tired
of being dragged through
your company bullshit.

44:35.542 --> 44:36.717
I've dealt with it
my whole life.

44:36.761 --> 44:37.892
You didn't earn that money.

44:37.936 --> 44:39.415
You're a trust fund kid.

44:39.459 --> 44:41.156
Did whatever you wanted
your whole life,

44:41.200 --> 44:43.245
waiting around for Daddy
to fill your pockets.

44:43.289 --> 44:45.291
Don't. No. Don't pretend
to know me, Trevor.

44:45.334 --> 44:46.858
It makes you look stupid.

44:46.901 --> 44:48.947
Finley was never in my life,

44:48.990 --> 44:52.646
but the company's antics
completely destroyed
whatever life I had.

44:52.690 --> 44:54.866
And you know what?
I busted my ass
to get through school.

44:54.909 --> 44:58.739
Bussing tables, tending the bar,
taking out loans.

44:58.783 --> 45:01.960
- No one ever gave me anything.
- All right. All right.
Easy. My bad.

45:03.918 --> 45:06.921
We might as well
call the Foundation
and see what they can do.

45:08.836 --> 45:11.360
Yeah. Sure thing.

45:16.148 --> 45:19.673
Got it.
I'll find out what I can.

45:21.457 --> 45:23.459
- Let's take a break...
- Fair enough.

45:23.503 --> 45:25.244
...and reconvene
in five minutes.

45:25.287 --> 45:26.985
- Yeah, fine.
- Fine.

rejoin the call.

Oh, Finley.

Please tell me at least one
of us is inebriated, babe.

46:02.542 --> 46:05.806
Not quite yet
but getting there.

46:07.329 --> 46:08.504
Are you on your way?

46:08.548 --> 46:10.985
I wish.

46:11.029 --> 46:12.378
Look, I'm sorry.

46:14.641 --> 46:16.469
- Talk to you later, okay?
- It's okay.

46:18.863 --> 46:21.866

♪♪

46:49.676 --> 46:52.766
Hi. This is Riku Matsuda.

46:52.810 --> 46:56.117
Um, you may know me already.

46:57.902 --> 47:00.905
There's a situation
that I need to tell you about.

47:26.495 --> 47:29.803
Hey, Sam.
I wish we had time to catch up.

47:29.847 --> 47:32.023
I know you must have
a million questions to ask me,

47:32.066 --> 47:34.286
but I'm afraid I don't have time
to answer them.

47:34.329 --> 47:36.462
And I know I wasn't always
the best father,

47:36.505 --> 47:40.074
or any kind of father at all,
come to think of it.

47:40.118 --> 47:43.208
Oh, I was a son of a bitch.
But, anyway, um,

47:43.251 --> 47:47.168
yeah, I think when your mother
died, I lost all touch
with humanity.

47:47.212 --> 47:49.649
That sounds like a crock
of old horse shit, doesn't it?

47:49.692 --> 47:51.912
"I lost all touch
with humanity. Boo-hoo."

47:51.956 --> 47:53.914
Anyway, you know what I mean.

47:53.958 --> 47:56.221
I'm-- I'm sure it got to you,
and I'm sure it, uh,

47:56.264 --> 47:57.657
hurt you a lot, and, um--

47:57.700 --> 47:59.702
anyway, uh...

47:59.746 --> 48:01.835
You know,
I'm just sorry your mother's,

48:01.879 --> 48:04.446
uh, death coincided with,
uh, your birth.

48:04.490 --> 48:06.405
But that's enough of all that.

48:06.448 --> 48:08.494
It's water under the bridge,
as the man said, you know?

48:08.537 --> 48:10.191
Water under the bridge.

48:10.235 --> 48:11.584
Anyway, where's the point--
ah, yes.

48:11.627 --> 48:14.892
Now, here we are.
As you remember, I, um--

48:14.935 --> 48:18.243
Yeah, I, uh, I dived or dove,
or whatever it was,

48:18.286 --> 48:22.638
I plunged deep into the heart
of the-- the Quantinuum Project.

48:22.682 --> 48:26.686
Do you remember?
And, uh, yeah, it was
the main focus of my life.

48:26.729 --> 48:30.124
I was, uh-- it took me years
before I let my guard down.

48:30.168 --> 48:33.823
And, um, yeah, if I remember
it correctly...

48:33.867 --> 48:37.653
Years before I woke up--
it was the year 2002.

48:37.697 --> 48:39.133
Yeah, I came to my senses,
I guess,

48:39.177 --> 48:41.353
or maybe I went back to sleep.
Who knows?

48:41.396 --> 48:43.572
But, anyway, I remember it
clear as yesterday.

48:43.616 --> 48:47.011
It was, uh, God,
it was that glorious dream,

48:47.054 --> 48:49.230
like summer way up in
Cloud Cuckoo Land.
Where was that?

48:49.274 --> 48:52.190
Northern California.
Yeah. East of Carmel.

48:52.233 --> 48:55.323
East of Eden, I used to call it
'cause that's where
it all started, wasn't it?

48:55.367 --> 48:57.717
The Land of Nod
on the East of Eden.

48:57.760 --> 49:00.589
Yeah.
The Hart Enterprise.

49:00.633 --> 49:03.941
Oh, my God. They were crazy.
They were all really crazy.

49:03.984 --> 49:05.986
But I was crazier than all
of them. Did you know that?

49:06.030 --> 49:08.336
Yeah, I was bored
out of my skull.

49:08.380 --> 49:10.599
I'd been for years now
for the big...
and all...

49:10.643 --> 49:14.560
And, uh, I'm still here
for something God knows what--

49:14.603 --> 49:16.083
Well, talk about God.

49:16.127 --> 49:17.867
Yeah, Aldous Huxley,
he was my God.

49:17.911 --> 49:21.088
The Doors of Perception.

49:22.176 --> 49:23.743
God.

49:25.266 --> 49:27.225
Yeah,
that's when it all started.

49:28.791 --> 49:31.620
You think I'm crazy?
I'm not.

49:31.664 --> 49:34.797
But I'm sure
you must realize by now
that I'm very much alive.

49:34.841 --> 49:36.538
And, uh, yeah.

49:36.582 --> 49:39.846
I, uh, can't reveal
my location to you, of course,

49:39.889 --> 49:43.328
and I cannot, um,
communicate with you
in any other way.

49:43.371 --> 49:45.634
But my death,
or my so-called death,

49:45.678 --> 49:47.854
was something
that had to happen.

49:47.897 --> 49:50.030
You understand?
Anyway, that's another story.

49:50.074 --> 49:52.293
This is the point, um, Sam.

49:52.337 --> 49:54.339
And, uh, it is important
that you hear me out.

49:54.382 --> 49:56.254
Really, it's because
I'm gonna need your help,

49:56.297 --> 49:58.908
if that's okay, you know?
I hope so anyway.

49:58.952 --> 50:03.087
Um, so here's the deal.

50:03.130 --> 50:05.524
The people
or the faction that drove me

50:05.567 --> 50:07.526
out of the Hart Enterprises

50:07.569 --> 50:11.225
will not allow the machine
to remain functional,

50:11.269 --> 50:17.101
and it is essential
and vital to humanity
that it does remain functional.

50:17.144 --> 50:18.276
You understand?

50:18.319 --> 50:20.278
It will not be enough for them,

50:20.321 --> 50:21.975
uh, you know, to--
They'll talk to you

50:22.019 --> 50:23.672
and try to persuade you
to stop. No.

50:23.716 --> 50:26.240
Because they will keep coming.
They will not stop!

50:26.284 --> 50:28.808
Because they're adamant,
you know?

50:28.851 --> 50:33.073
And beware because these are
the real psychos,
the real wackos.

50:33.117 --> 50:36.642
The only way
you can beat them is to,
um, punch in those codes.

50:36.685 --> 50:39.340
And you have, in my estimation,
just under an hour.

50:39.384 --> 50:41.429
Anyway, this is the point--

50:41.473 --> 50:43.779
'Cause these clowns,
if they, um,

50:43.823 --> 50:45.999
can prevent you
or stop you or, you know,

50:46.043 --> 50:48.741
even hack into codes,
the machine will rupture

50:48.784 --> 50:52.658
and cause a globe-killing
disaster event.

50:52.701 --> 50:54.225
And it'll be bye-bye.

50:54.268 --> 50:57.663
And I'm serious, you know?

50:57.706 --> 51:01.449
So, um-- and they
will not stop, you know?

51:01.493 --> 51:03.712
They will come and find you.
I mean, for example,

51:03.756 --> 51:05.932
the only one in their group,

51:05.975 --> 51:07.977
in your group,
that they knew about
was that guy Hakan,

51:08.021 --> 51:10.110
and they'll find
the rest of you

51:10.154 --> 51:11.894
because, you know, uh,
boundaries don't matter,

51:11.938 --> 51:13.940
and distance doesn't matter.

51:13.983 --> 51:16.247
You know,
I'm halfway around the world

51:16.290 --> 51:19.685
and I, uh, connected
with you in, um,

51:19.728 --> 51:21.730
it was a millisecond,
wasn't it?

51:21.774 --> 51:24.864
And, um, anyway-- what--
what else was I gonna say?

51:24.907 --> 51:27.867
Oh, yes, yes. I have a--
I have a-- I've got--

51:27.910 --> 51:30.609
I've got a device for you,
uh, Sam.

51:30.652 --> 51:33.742
I'll explain it later.
But I've placed the device

51:33.786 --> 51:38.747
in a box together with,
uh, several face masks, okay?

51:38.791 --> 51:41.837
And they're in--
the box is in the closet

51:41.881 --> 51:45.624
of the bedroom you used
when you came to visit me.
Do you remember?

51:45.667 --> 51:49.367
So you must get the box
and you must wear
the face mask at all costs.

51:49.410 --> 51:51.760
What else was I gonna say?
That's about it, I think.

51:51.804 --> 51:53.371
Um...

51:54.589 --> 51:56.069
so download these codes.

51:56.113 --> 51:58.332
Don't neglect and don't delay.

51:58.376 --> 52:00.117
And, um-- Oh, something else
I wanted to say.

52:00.160 --> 52:02.467
Something, um,
having seen you

52:02.510 --> 52:05.948
in that old house
with your son.

52:05.992 --> 52:08.690
Good-good-looking boy
there, Sam.

52:08.734 --> 52:11.040
Don't do to him
what I did to you.

52:11.084 --> 52:13.739
- No, I won't.
- I don't know
if you know this,

52:13.782 --> 52:18.483
but, um, I always expected
great things from you, Sam.

52:18.526 --> 52:19.919
Did you know that?

52:19.962 --> 52:21.747
Yeah. So now is your chance

52:21.790 --> 52:25.054
to fulfill the destiny
I hoped for you.

52:25.098 --> 52:30.234
Everyone in your team has been,
um, chosen and has a reason.

52:30.277 --> 52:33.628
They all have a purpose,
and I'm sure you
will find your purpose.

52:33.672 --> 52:35.326
So good luck to the team.

52:35.369 --> 52:38.894
Wear the face masks.
Wear those face masks.

52:38.938 --> 52:40.548
And I'll see you around.

- Yes. Yeah.
I'm-- I'm-- I'm-- I'm fine.

53:31.556 --> 53:32.687
Is it really him?

My mom said
there was a box for me.

53:36.343 --> 53:39.651
It had a phone, some videos.

53:41.609 --> 53:43.655
He said I was the only one

- Fringe science?
- Yes, Katherine.
Fringe science.

54:10.943 --> 54:12.292

how goofy that sounds?

54:12.336 --> 54:14.076
Yes. I-- yes.

54:14.120 --> 54:17.079
Okay. So did you know
he was into--

I don't know
anything about him, Katherine!

54:19.256 --> 54:21.910
I have told you all of this!
He was not a father to me.

54:21.954 --> 54:24.173
- I was raised by
my Aunt Rebecca.
- Raised by his sister. I know.

54:24.217 --> 54:25.349
He's...

54:32.094 --> 54:34.880
Ah. Sammy boy.

54:39.145 --> 54:43.236
Swear you did not put that photo
in the nursery bed.

Sam. I promise.

55:13.919 --> 55:15.921
He's your father.

55:15.964 --> 55:17.401
Would he lie to you
about something like this?

55:17.444 --> 55:18.445
Yeah.

55:21.405 --> 55:22.362
Have you ever...

55:24.625 --> 55:26.323
Have you ever
been to Coney Island?

55:30.196 --> 55:31.589
No?

55:32.285 --> 55:33.373
Um...

55:36.115 --> 55:40.032
My dad would always
be chasing funding,
you know, when I was a kid.

55:41.599 --> 55:45.733
And, uh,
he had some Wall Street guy,

55:45.777 --> 55:49.650
just had him on the hook.
Just trying to reel him in.

55:49.694 --> 55:54.394
And it was the one, like,
business trip that he took me on

55:54.438 --> 55:56.788
that he actually
spent any time with me.

55:56.831 --> 55:58.137
It was the one time.

56:00.008 --> 56:05.884
So he ended up taking me
to Coney Island,

56:05.927 --> 56:09.757
and then, uh,
he put me on the Cyclone.

56:09.801 --> 56:12.064
You know, the place,
like the old--

56:12.107 --> 56:16.634
just some rickety,
old wooden roller coaster.

56:16.677 --> 56:21.421
And I must have ridden that
a dozen times, and...

56:25.294 --> 56:27.471
I don't know--
you know, I go around

56:27.514 --> 56:30.038
and I-- I'd see his face
in the crowd.

56:30.082 --> 56:32.214
I'd wave and smile.

56:32.258 --> 56:34.129
You know, he--
he'd wave and smile back,

56:34.173 --> 56:35.783
and it would just,
you know, just go around.

56:35.827 --> 56:40.788
And every time that was our--
that was a thing.

56:40.832 --> 56:43.878
Until one time it came around
and he just wasn't there.

56:47.491 --> 56:49.275
He got a page and left.

56:51.495 --> 56:52.713
I was nine.

56:56.587 --> 56:58.415
It felt like I--
I had gotten swallowed up

56:58.458 --> 57:01.853
into just a sea of people.

57:01.896 --> 57:07.467
And I was terrified, so I just--
I-- I ran to the beach,

57:07.511 --> 57:09.774
and I just walked
up and down the shoreline

57:09.817 --> 57:13.386
just sobbing until
my Aunt Rebecca picked me up.

57:17.738 --> 57:19.697
He came-- I don't know,

57:19.740 --> 57:22.003
it was like a couple days
later he came back.

57:23.614 --> 57:27.922
And he said,
"Hey, my bad, kid.

57:27.966 --> 57:29.446
I won't do it again."

57:31.491 --> 57:35.800
And I-- I think about
that specific time all the time,

57:35.843 --> 57:40.761
and I feel embarrassed
because I believed him.

57:43.590 --> 57:46.245
That was the one trip
we did anything fun.

57:48.421 --> 57:51.032
My Aunt Rebecca wouldn't let me
see him after that.

57:52.381 --> 57:57.517
So, I can't just blindly trust

57:57.561 --> 57:59.780
anything that he's saying
to just be the truth.

58:00.868 --> 58:02.479
I understand.

58:05.177 --> 58:06.439
Okay.

58:06.483 --> 58:08.441
I'm gonna log back online,

58:08.485 --> 58:10.008
I'm gonna see if I can
wrap my head around this.

58:10.051 --> 58:12.314
Um, but, hey, I love you.

58:36.164 --> 58:38.166
Welcome back, everyone.

58:38.210 --> 58:41.430
So I talked to William
at the Foundation.

58:41.474 --> 58:42.997
Check out Hakan's window.

58:44.346 --> 58:46.305
Who the hell is that guy?

58:46.348 --> 58:47.698
What the hell is going on?

58:50.570 --> 58:53.268
Access code accepted.

58:53.312 --> 58:55.532
Thirty-five minutes remaining.

59:08.675 --> 59:10.982

59:11.591 --> 59:13.245
Hang on.

59:14.812 --> 59:16.683
Mom, who's that man outside?

59:31.089 --> 59:32.960
Veronica?

59:33.004 --> 59:34.875
- Veronica?
- What?

59:34.919 --> 59:36.790
Hey, is there some place
in your house you can hide?

59:36.834 --> 59:38.662
- Why?
- This man, he'll do

59:38.705 --> 59:40.402
the exact same thing to you
he did to Hakan, okay?

59:40.446 --> 59:42.100
This is way bigger
than we know it is.

59:42.143 --> 59:45.146
- What? How do you know?
- Listen, I just know.

59:45.190 --> 59:48.019
Yeah, but how?
Half hour ago you were all,

59:48.062 --> 59:50.499
- "What are here for?"
and now you're an expert.

59:50.543 --> 59:53.067
- He's trying to
get into my house.

59:53.111 --> 59:55.069
Do not let him
get the password.

59:56.375 --> 59:58.333
Can you get out of there?

59:58.377 --> 1:00:00.292
- And go where?

1:00:00.335 --> 1:00:01.989
Okay, is there some place
in your house you can hide?

1:00:04.557 --> 1:00:07.429
♪♪

1:00:07.473 --> 1:00:09.170
Mom.

1:00:24.185 --> 1:00:26.492
Oh fuck.

1:01:06.575 --> 1:01:09.187
I'm not here to hurt you.

1:01:09.230 --> 1:01:11.363
Just tell me
where your computer is.

1:01:12.886 --> 1:01:15.323
Where is your computer?

1:01:31.078 --> 1:01:35.126
- Veronica?
-Ms. Schultz
has disconnected.

1:01:35.169 --> 1:01:36.954
Is there another way
she can punch in her code?

1:01:38.825 --> 1:01:40.566
Where are you going?

1:01:40.609 --> 1:01:42.263
- Uh, I got to get some air.
- Get some air?

1:01:42.307 --> 1:01:44.701
Yes, some air, dammit. This shit
is freaking me out, okay?

1:01:44.744 --> 1:01:46.746
I need to go out,
clear my head.
Is that okay with you?

1:01:46.790 --> 1:01:49.357
- Sure. Whatever.
- Yeah, sure. Whatever.

1:01:49.401 --> 1:01:52.186
Thirty minutes remaining.
One passcode received.

1:01:52.230 --> 1:01:53.927
Uh, come on.

1:01:53.971 --> 1:01:56.103
Four passcodes remaining.

1:02:12.424 --> 1:02:13.555
Is he gone?

1:02:19.474 --> 1:02:20.693
Shh.

1:02:33.488 --> 1:02:36.491
Veronica?
It's me, Sam.

1:02:36.535 --> 1:02:39.494
- Sam?
- Yes, it's me. Sam Hart.

1:02:39.538 --> 1:02:41.409
That's impossible.
How did you--?

1:02:41.453 --> 1:02:42.846
I don't know.

1:02:43.803 --> 1:02:45.457
That song.

1:02:45.500 --> 1:02:47.285
Veronica, when I was little,

1:02:47.328 --> 1:02:49.548
I remember one time
he was driving us somewhere

1:02:49.591 --> 1:02:51.332
and that song came on.

1:02:51.376 --> 1:02:56.250
He smiled, turned it up,
and I had never seen him
like that.

1:02:56.294 --> 1:02:58.296
And I asked him
why he liked that song so much

1:02:58.339 --> 1:03:01.516
and he said,
"It reminded me of someone."

1:03:01.560 --> 1:03:03.562
He talked about you.

1:03:03.605 --> 1:03:06.870
I never knew who you were
but I knew about you.

1:03:08.828 --> 1:03:11.048
He loved you. I know that.

1:03:11.091 --> 1:03:14.181
I know he loved you both
very much.

1:03:15.661 --> 1:03:18.664
When I leave,
you have to put in those codes.

1:03:18.707 --> 1:03:22.363
Do you have another computer?
Yours is shot.

1:03:22.407 --> 1:03:24.583
- Jamie--
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.

1:03:24.626 --> 1:03:26.585
We have.

1:03:26.628 --> 1:03:29.762
Veronica, you really
loved him, didn't you?

1:03:29.806 --> 1:03:31.503
It was more than--

1:03:33.287 --> 1:03:38.553
It was more than anyone will--
will ever understand, Sam.

1:03:40.512 --> 1:03:43.907
That song, it means something,
doesn't it?

1:03:45.386 --> 1:03:47.258
I saw your face
when the song started.

1:03:47.301 --> 1:03:50.827
It looked like it took you
back to something.

1:03:54.352 --> 1:03:58.573
We went to Sydney
to close a deal. All business.

1:03:58.617 --> 1:04:01.446
He was always all business,
you know?

1:04:05.145 --> 1:04:08.670
Finley, me, and a few others
went out to celebrate.

1:04:08.714 --> 1:04:10.542
We went to some dive bar.

1:04:10.585 --> 1:04:12.936
You know how much
he loved dive bars.

1:04:15.242 --> 1:04:16.722
And...

1:04:20.682 --> 1:04:23.685
that song was playing,

1:04:23.729 --> 1:04:26.123
and I couldn't convince him
that it was not called

1:04:26.166 --> 1:04:28.516
"If You Like Pina Coladas."

1:04:31.780 --> 1:04:36.133
It was the first time
I saw him as a...

1:04:38.396 --> 1:04:39.876
as a real person.

1:04:45.403 --> 1:04:48.623
He has difficulty
letting people in, Sam.

1:04:50.451 --> 1:04:51.888
But when he does...

1:04:54.760 --> 1:04:56.109
it's permanent.

1:04:59.330 --> 1:05:03.638
Veronica,
I can see why he loved you.

1:05:03.682 --> 1:05:05.075
Jamie.

1:05:07.425 --> 1:05:08.948
Okay, I'll see you soon.

1:05:21.526 --> 1:05:22.570
Yeah.

1:05:32.711 --> 1:05:34.887
- Here, Mom.
- Thank you.

1:05:34.931 --> 1:05:37.107
Thank you, Jamie.
Oh, my God.

1:05:49.728 --> 1:05:51.773
Ah, attagirl.

1:06:09.574 --> 1:06:12.881
Override lockdown
code accepted.

1:06:12.925 --> 1:06:16.668
In the event
one or more parties sign off,

1:06:16.711 --> 1:06:19.236
the system
will no longer lock down.

1:06:21.238 --> 1:06:25.546
Passcode accepted.
Twenty-five minutes remaining.

1:06:25.590 --> 1:06:27.940
Three passcodes remaining.

1:06:38.168 --> 1:06:40.213
Hey, okay, um,
can you do me a favor?

1:06:40.257 --> 1:06:41.780
What?

1:06:41.823 --> 1:06:43.303
I need you to look into
Hart Enterprises

1:06:43.347 --> 1:06:45.740
and see who opposed Finley.

1:06:45.784 --> 1:06:49.048
Who was the one
that forced him out, okay?

1:06:49.092 --> 1:06:50.354
Okay. Thank you, baby.
I love you.

1:06:58.623 --> 1:07:01.147
Riku, who did you
talk to at the Foundation?

1:07:01.191 --> 1:07:02.801
A man named William.

1:07:03.889 --> 1:07:05.021
How did you get the technology?

1:07:05.064 --> 1:07:06.718
That-- that's a long story.

1:07:06.761 --> 1:07:08.763
William's not on our side--
Finley's side.

1:07:08.807 --> 1:07:11.592
- How do you know?
- Trust me.

1:07:11.636 --> 1:07:14.508
Wait. He was--
he was at Veronica's?

1:07:14.552 --> 1:07:16.336
Yes.

1:07:16.380 --> 1:07:18.121
How can you be sure
it was him?

1:07:18.164 --> 1:07:20.123
You've never been
involved in-- in--

1:07:20.166 --> 1:07:21.820
Because he's my cousin.

1:07:24.301 --> 1:07:26.781
Riku, how sure are you
about both scenarios?

1:07:26.825 --> 1:07:30.742
I'm reasonably certain
that if we punch in the codes,
the machine will melt down.

1:07:30.785 --> 1:07:32.787
I need you to quantify
your certainty.

1:07:32.831 --> 1:07:36.095
Well, according to the test
we ran and the research--

1:07:36.139 --> 1:07:39.359
No, no.
Just give me the number.

1:07:39.403 --> 1:07:43.407
Seventy percent chance
that the machine will melt--
melt down.

1:07:43.450 --> 1:07:45.626
And if we don't input the codes?

1:07:45.670 --> 1:07:49.108
It's an 11% chance
not inputting the codes will--

1:07:49.152 --> 1:07:51.023
No. Why-- why the variance?
That doesn't make sense.

1:07:51.067 --> 1:07:53.330
'Cause the-- the power source
is unstable.

1:07:54.809 --> 1:07:56.159
And there's a chance that...

1:07:58.117 --> 1:08:00.293
There's a chance
that your-- your-- your father

1:08:00.337 --> 1:08:02.556
rigged the machine.

1:08:02.600 --> 1:08:06.995
What does he care? He's dead.
It-- it-- it won't affect him.

1:08:07.996 --> 1:08:09.172
Who did you call, Riku?

1:08:09.215 --> 1:08:12.566
What? I called the Foundation.

1:08:12.610 --> 1:08:15.917
No, no. You called someone else.
Who was it?

1:08:15.961 --> 1:08:18.572
And when Hakan saw the person
in his front yard

1:08:18.616 --> 1:08:21.097
and he said that they appeared
dizzy and nauseous,

1:08:21.140 --> 1:08:23.229
you knew what was happening,
didn't you?

1:08:23.273 --> 1:08:25.144
No. I don't-- I don't know
what you're talking about.

1:08:25.188 --> 1:08:27.625
You know about this tech,
don't you?

1:08:27.668 --> 1:08:30.671
You know among other things
that it can cause
vestibular disorder.

1:08:30.715 --> 1:08:32.456
Answer him, Riku.

1:08:32.499 --> 1:08:34.240
You told us
the tech never functioned,

1:08:34.284 --> 1:08:36.938
but that was a lie, wasn't it?

1:08:36.982 --> 1:08:39.985
Did you know that the person
who killed Hakan

1:08:40.028 --> 1:08:43.162
was using
the displacement technology?

1:08:43.206 --> 1:08:44.381
Answer me, Riku!

1:08:44.424 --> 1:08:45.556
- Answer him!

1:08:47.688 --> 1:08:49.516
I had my suspicions.

1:08:55.522 --> 1:08:58.656
- Hello, Douglas.
- They've entered
two numbers already.

1:08:58.699 --> 1:09:03.530
Yes, William told me.
What's your read on Riku?

1:09:03.574 --> 1:09:07.534
- Think he'll cave to Sam?
- No. No way.

1:09:07.578 --> 1:09:10.581
Rebecca, you tell William
he's off limits.

1:09:10.624 --> 1:09:14.106
- We had conducted
successful tests before.
- When?

1:09:16.021 --> 1:09:19.329
I can be there
in less than a minute
to ask you face to face.

1:09:19.372 --> 1:09:23.637
Back when I was
at Hart Enterprises,

1:09:23.681 --> 1:09:28.555
your father had disagreements
about how to best improve
the technology.

1:09:28.599 --> 1:09:31.776
Is that why you teamed up with
my aunt and Doug Mancini
to orchestrate a coup?

1:09:31.819 --> 1:09:33.995
Your father
was acting erratically!

1:09:34.039 --> 1:09:37.434
He was sick! He was-- he was--
he was a megalomaniac!

1:09:38.696 --> 1:09:40.654
Your brother
completely miscalculated

1:09:40.698 --> 1:09:43.396
what Riku brings to the table.

1:09:43.440 --> 1:09:46.704
I mean, that's how I recruited
the guy in the first place,
right?

1:09:46.747 --> 1:09:51.099
Yes, but you didn't
exactly recruit him

1:09:51.143 --> 1:09:53.319
for his resolve, did you?

1:09:59.369 --> 1:10:01.153
I'll tell William
that he's an ally.

1:10:03.503 --> 1:10:04.504
Anything else?

1:10:04.548 --> 1:10:05.549
Yeah.

1:10:08.073 --> 1:10:09.944
Hakan was dead.

1:10:09.988 --> 1:10:15.080
So someone had to punch in
his code for him.

1:10:15.123 --> 1:10:18.257
You think we have
a wildcard in the game?

1:10:18.301 --> 1:10:19.911
You think we don't?

1:10:22.261 --> 1:10:25.482
I'll talk to William.

1:10:25.525 --> 1:10:30.400
You convince Riku to stick to
his guns for 19 more minutes.

1:10:31.879 --> 1:10:33.707
♪♪

1:10:37.015 --> 1:10:40.323
Shit.

1:10:40.366 --> 1:10:42.281
So what's it gonna be?
Are you gonna punch in the code?

1:10:44.457 --> 1:10:46.372
I'm scared to.

1:10:46.416 --> 1:10:48.766
Finley may have been
who you say he was.

1:10:48.809 --> 1:10:50.637
I know he was a shitty father.

1:10:50.681 --> 1:10:53.684
But he was also a visionary,
and this is his life.

1:10:53.727 --> 1:10:55.903
And you're gonna--
you're gonna break
your commitment to him

1:10:55.947 --> 1:10:58.689
just because Rebecca's
better for the bottom line?

1:10:58.732 --> 1:11:00.343
Punch in your code.

1:11:01.561 --> 1:11:03.998
Punch in your code, Riku!

1:11:04.042 --> 1:11:06.740
- No! Do not answer that.

1:11:06.784 --> 1:11:09.482
You-- I know you wanna do
the right thing here.

1:11:12.311 --> 1:11:14.748
- Riku, punch in your code!

1:11:37.597 --> 1:11:39.251
Damn it!

1:12:27.517 --> 1:12:30.520
Riku Matsuda has disconnected.

1:12:30.563 --> 1:12:32.696
Seventeen minutes remaining.

1:12:50.627 --> 1:12:52.324
Trevor, you still with me?

1:12:54.674 --> 1:12:56.110
I don't know who I'm with.

1:13:06.773 --> 1:13:09.297
I thought you said
you were getting used to it.

1:13:09.341 --> 1:13:10.821
I thought I was.

1:13:14.259 --> 1:13:16.957
I'll be all right.

1:13:17.001 --> 1:13:18.568
When are you
leaving for Trevor's?

1:13:20.221 --> 1:13:22.963
I have Riku's computer
and his passcode.

1:13:23.007 --> 1:13:25.792
- I mean, there's no need--
- Did you destroy his computer?

1:13:25.836 --> 1:13:28.229
Not yet. I just made it back,

1:13:28.273 --> 1:13:30.101
and I've been
chundering in the loo.

1:13:30.144 --> 1:13:33.974
Destroy it. Finish this.

1:13:55.126 --> 1:13:56.344
He's gonna kill me.

1:14:00.784 --> 1:14:02.916
Hey. You having fun?

1:14:04.440 --> 1:14:06.267
Babe, you look stressed.

1:14:06.311 --> 1:14:11.142
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
Look, uh, I'm really sorry,

1:14:11.185 --> 1:14:14.493
but I'm right in the middle
of something really important,

1:14:14.537 --> 1:14:17.061
- and I can't explain it.
- Are you gonna make it?

1:14:17.104 --> 1:14:18.889
Of course, yeah.
I'm gonna make it.

1:14:18.932 --> 1:14:21.457
Why can't you
go to the Foundation,
or whatever you call it?

1:14:21.500 --> 1:14:23.546
Finley didn't leave me
the coordinates.

1:14:23.589 --> 1:14:25.765
- Were you close
with your cousin?
- Not really.

1:14:25.809 --> 1:14:28.986
I mean, my aunt favored him,
but why wouldn't she?

1:14:29.029 --> 1:14:31.162
Okay. Um, I got to go.
I'll-- I'll call you back.

1:14:31.205 --> 1:14:34.252
Um, I am just gonna go home.

1:14:34.295 --> 1:14:36.863
So, I'll see you
in a little bit.

1:14:36.907 --> 1:14:38.996
You're the best.
Foot rubs for a month, okay?

1:14:39.039 --> 1:14:42.303
And more. All right.
I'll see you soon. Bye, babe.

1:14:50.224 --> 1:14:52.009
How long you been together?

1:14:52.052 --> 1:14:54.359
Fourteen years.

1:14:54.402 --> 1:14:55.665
- Where'd you meet?
- Come on.

1:14:55.708 --> 1:14:57.971
Don't start
this buddy-buddy stuff, Sam.

1:14:58.015 --> 1:15:01.105
Out of all the people
in this mess,
I trust you the least.

1:15:01.148 --> 1:15:02.628
Why is that?

1:15:02.672 --> 1:15:05.196
Because nothing
about you adds up.

1:15:05.239 --> 1:15:07.633
You don't trust Finley,
you do trust Finley.

1:15:07.677 --> 1:15:09.243
You don't wanna
punch in the codes,

1:15:09.287 --> 1:15:11.637
then you do wanna
punch in the code.

1:15:11.681 --> 1:15:15.249
Riku's gone.
Hakan's dead. Veronica--

1:15:15.293 --> 1:15:19.384
Look, the only person I trust
in all of this is Finley,
and he's gone, too.

1:15:19.427 --> 1:15:21.778
And that man took me in
after I messed up.

1:15:21.821 --> 1:15:24.345
But you, you, you...

1:15:30.003 --> 1:15:32.876
Why didn't you
just go save Riku, hmm?

1:15:32.919 --> 1:15:34.312
Like you did Veronica?

1:15:34.355 --> 1:15:36.749
I could--
I thought I could convince him.

1:15:36.793 --> 1:15:40.448
Or zip over, and punch in
the code like you did Hakan.

1:15:40.492 --> 1:15:42.059
Like I did what?

1:15:43.669 --> 1:15:44.757
Hey.

1:15:50.546 --> 1:15:52.852
Sam, can you hear me?

1:15:52.896 --> 1:15:55.594
Anyway, I tell you,

1:15:55.638 --> 1:15:58.162
if you don't punch in
those codes, it's over.

1:15:58.205 --> 1:16:00.686
You got me?
We are dead, we're all dead.

1:16:00.730 --> 1:16:02.514
Babe, I told you--

1:16:02.558 --> 1:16:04.603
- I have your wife.
- Who the hell are you?

1:16:04.647 --> 1:16:06.649
I know more about
the power sources

1:16:06.692 --> 1:16:10.000
of that machine
than anyone on this planet,

1:16:10.043 --> 1:16:13.481
and you better believe
because they've severely
underestimated its stability.

1:16:13.525 --> 1:16:17.442
I won't harm her,
so long as you comply.

1:16:17.485 --> 1:16:19.226
You goddamn son of a bitch.

1:16:19.270 --> 1:16:20.750
- Trevor--
- If you hurt her,

1:16:20.793 --> 1:16:22.665
if you hurt her,
I swear to God!

1:16:22.708 --> 1:16:27.147
No threats, Trevor.
Do not put in the code.

1:16:27.191 --> 1:16:30.194
Just tell Trevor
something from me, would you?

1:16:31.848 --> 1:16:33.589
I want you to tell him about

1:16:33.632 --> 1:16:35.460
that night he met
his wife, Taylor.

1:16:35.503 --> 1:16:38.637
They were in the Florida Keys,
a hole in the wall dive bar,

1:16:38.681 --> 1:16:39.943
in Marathon, I think it was.

1:16:41.118 --> 1:16:43.337
Okay. O-okay.

1:16:43.381 --> 1:16:47.472
Okay. What do you want me to do?
Just don't hurt her.

1:16:47.515 --> 1:16:50.170
Destroy your laptop.
Stay in your apartment.

1:16:50.214 --> 1:16:52.172
When I have proof
you've destroyed it--

1:16:52.216 --> 1:16:55.219
Okay. Okay, just hold on,
I'll do it right now.

1:16:57.308 --> 1:17:00.441
Fourteen minutes remaining.

1:17:00.485 --> 1:17:03.183
Spotted 20 bucks and, uh,
told him to buy her a drink.

1:17:08.449 --> 1:17:11.191
Trevor, no, no, no!
Hey, stop, stop!
What's going on?

1:17:11.235 --> 1:17:13.063
He's gonna kill my wife!

1:17:13.106 --> 1:17:16.544
Trevor, st-- no, no.
Trevor, he's lying.

1:17:16.588 --> 1:17:18.721
- We have to input the codes.

1:17:18.764 --> 1:17:19.852
Trevor, listen, listen.

1:17:24.161 --> 1:17:25.902
Trevor, no, no!

1:17:25.945 --> 1:17:28.295
We have to input the codes.

1:17:28.339 --> 1:17:31.603
He's got my wife.

1:17:31.647 --> 1:17:35.085
Okay, what if the only person
that you trust is still alive?

1:17:35.128 --> 1:17:38.958
He remembers when you met
your wife in the Florida Keys,

1:17:39.002 --> 1:17:41.265
at a--
at a dive bar in Marathon.

1:17:41.308 --> 1:17:43.789
Uh, you were drinking
margaritas and shooting pool.

1:17:43.833 --> 1:17:45.965
And he-- um, she came in
with her friend.

1:17:46.009 --> 1:17:48.359
She was so pretty, made you
scratch on the eight ball.

1:17:48.402 --> 1:17:51.667
And then, you lost,
uh, your last 20 bucks,

1:17:51.710 --> 1:17:53.538
and you came over to me,
and you said--

1:17:53.581 --> 1:17:55.148
Back off, Finster.

1:17:55.192 --> 1:17:56.759
- She's mine.
- She's mine.

1:17:56.802 --> 1:18:00.632
Yes! And then, he spotted you
a 20 to buy her a drink.

1:18:04.244 --> 1:18:05.637
I traced that call.

1:18:07.770 --> 1:18:10.860
All this time, I traced it.

1:18:10.903 --> 1:18:13.036
He wants you
to put in your code.

1:18:13.079 --> 1:18:15.778
Nine minutes remaining.

1:18:26.005 --> 1:18:27.224
Let me talk to her.

1:18:27.267 --> 1:18:28.616
I said no threats.

1:18:28.660 --> 1:18:31.445
- Okay, I'll destroy it.
- Trevor, no, no!

1:18:31.489 --> 1:18:33.447
Just give me
five seconds with her.

1:18:33.491 --> 1:18:36.799
That's all I need.
Prove to me that she's okay.

1:18:48.245 --> 1:18:50.377
- Hey, babe.
- Hey.

1:18:50.421 --> 1:18:51.727
What's happening?

1:19:13.879 --> 1:19:15.272
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1:19:15.315 --> 1:19:16.926
Run, baby, run, run!

1:19:16.969 --> 1:19:18.318
Run, baby.

1:19:18.362 --> 1:19:21.800
I'll kill you!
Get back here!

1:19:21.844 --> 1:19:23.454
- Babe, let me in.
- Ma'am.

1:19:23.497 --> 1:19:24.760
- Let me in.
- In here.

1:19:26.283 --> 1:19:28.546
- Ma'am, are you okay?
- I'm okay.

1:19:33.899 --> 1:19:36.554
I guess I'll find out
soon enough if that worked.

1:19:48.218 --> 1:19:51.787
Passcode accepted.
Eight minutes remaining.

1:19:51.830 --> 1:19:54.833
I'm sorry I hurt you.
I remember that day, too.

1:19:54.877 --> 1:19:57.575
But, uh, I never knew
it got to you, you know.

1:19:57.618 --> 1:20:01.797
And, uh, that's why
I tried to make it up to you.

1:20:01.840 --> 1:20:05.844
Um, yeah, I love you, Sam.

1:20:05.888 --> 1:20:08.151
Don't like saying that too much.
Don't like all this...

1:20:08.194 --> 1:20:11.545
love and fondness racket.

1:20:11.589 --> 1:20:14.331
- It makes me feel creepy.

1:20:14.374 --> 1:20:17.464
Anyway, um, yeah.

1:20:38.224 --> 1:20:39.225
I...

1:20:40.618 --> 1:20:41.706
I can...

1:20:42.620 --> 1:20:43.839
I can go back.

1:20:45.449 --> 1:20:46.885
Oh, I can-- I can go back.

1:20:51.063 --> 1:20:55.067
Temporal, temporal,
temporal displacement,
it's time travel.

1:20:55.111 --> 1:20:56.634
I can go back.

1:20:56.677 --> 1:21:00.856
Temporal, temporal displacement.
It's time travel.

1:21:02.422 --> 1:21:04.294
I can go-- I can go back.

1:21:07.645 --> 1:21:09.299
Sam, I've got to caution you.

1:21:09.342 --> 1:21:12.432
Um...

1:21:12.476 --> 1:21:17.176
Any small change you make
will cause ripple effects, okay?

1:21:17.220 --> 1:21:19.526
You'll be tempted
to save someone's life.

1:21:19.570 --> 1:21:22.921
I know I was. But a change
that big can cause,

1:21:22.965 --> 1:21:27.491
not just a ripple,
but a big tsunami, okay?

1:21:27.534 --> 1:21:29.710
So be warned.

1:21:41.418 --> 1:21:43.507
I'm sorry I didn't
get here sooner, Hakan.

1:22:06.138 --> 1:22:07.270
I'm sorry.

1:22:39.911 --> 1:22:41.869
Passcode accepted.

1:22:43.349 --> 1:22:46.396
Thank you, Mr. Matsuda.

1:22:46.439 --> 1:22:51.314
The Quantinuum Initiative
is now online
and fully operational.

1:23:07.199 --> 1:23:08.461
Hey.

1:23:09.201 --> 1:23:10.594
How's she doing?

1:23:10.637 --> 1:23:12.248
She's on her way
up to me right now.

1:23:14.424 --> 1:23:16.643
- Thank you.
- No, no. Thank you, Trevor.

1:23:20.082 --> 1:23:24.477
Hey, didn't you wanna know
where I traced that call to?

1:23:26.610 --> 1:23:28.351
I think I know.

1:23:28.394 --> 1:23:30.875
And--
and if I don't, then...

1:23:30.918 --> 1:23:34.705
Yeah, you can go
anywhere, any time.

1:23:34.748 --> 1:23:38.056
Yeah. I gotta go, uh...

1:23:39.971 --> 1:23:41.799
I gotta go check in
on somebody.

1:23:45.063 --> 1:23:47.805
Shocking news
from the tech world today,
as Rebecca Hart,

1:23:47.848 --> 1:23:50.851
the sister of late eccentric
billionaire Finley Hart,

1:23:50.895 --> 1:23:52.940
was arrested
for a litany of charges

1:23:52.984 --> 1:23:55.769
including conspiracy
to commit murder.

1:24:14.005 --> 1:24:17.574
Authorities say
the murder of former
Hart Chairman Hakan Nordquist

1:24:17.617 --> 1:24:20.142
was carried out
at Mrs. Hart's behest,

1:24:20.185 --> 1:24:23.971
by her son, William Porter,
who now faces charges
in Sweden.

1:24:25.451 --> 1:24:27.714
Mrs. Hart
allegedly collaborated

1:24:27.758 --> 1:24:31.153
with former Hart Enterprises
Head of Security, Doug Mancini,

1:24:31.196 --> 1:24:33.807
to not only oust Finley Hart
from the company,

1:24:33.851 --> 1:24:36.984
but to steal
developing technology
from the company.

1:24:37.028 --> 1:24:40.466
Federal authorities
have issued a warrant
for Mr. Mancini's arrest,

1:24:40.510 --> 1:24:43.382
in connection with the still
unraveling conspiracy.

1:25:24.554 --> 1:25:27.426
You know, this piano
is like an old friend to me,

1:25:27.470 --> 1:25:31.082
always has been,
source of inspiration.

1:25:31.126 --> 1:25:34.390
If I got stuck
and couldn't figure things out

1:25:34.433 --> 1:25:36.653
I would just sit here
and play, or improvise.

1:25:36.696 --> 1:25:40.352
- Sometimes for hours and hours,

1:25:40.396 --> 1:25:44.226
especially after Samantha
was taken from us.

1:25:44.269 --> 1:25:47.142
In fact, I was playing
this piece on this very piano

1:25:47.185 --> 1:25:51.624
when I figured out the key
to making the machine work.

1:25:51.668 --> 1:25:54.888
When you were a kid,
if you couldn't sleep,

1:25:54.932 --> 1:26:00.938
you'd always ask me
to play this piece of music,
which I'd improvised.

1:26:00.981 --> 1:26:04.246
And I'd play it,
and you'd go to sleep,
probably bored.

1:26:24.004 --> 1:26:25.702
Glad you made it, Sam.

1:26:27.443 --> 1:26:29.009
We have a lot to talk about.

1:26:30.620 --> 1:26:33.188
♪♪

1:28:23.428 --> 1:28:24.908
That is a go?

1:28:24.951 --> 1:28:26.649
Yep. Ready.

1:28:26.692 --> 1:28:28.607
The purpose of this thing
is to see

1:28:28.651 --> 1:28:30.740
what we can achieve with,
like, the MacGyver.

1:28:30.783 --> 1:28:31.784
Like, what do we have--
what are the tools around me,

1:28:31.828 --> 1:28:33.395
what can I do, you know.

1:28:33.438 --> 1:28:35.005
Uh, I can kind of
imagined the title sequence

1:28:35.048 --> 1:28:38.574
ending with Finley Hart is--
has passed away.

1:28:38.617 --> 1:28:41.490
Ex-billionaire Finley Hart
has reportedly passed away

1:28:41.533 --> 1:28:43.361
due to complications
from kidney failure.

1:28:43.405 --> 1:28:46.277
His wife died
while giving birth in 1992.

1:28:46.321 --> 1:28:49.411
He's survived by
his sister, Rebecca,
and his son, Samuel Hart.

1:28:49.454 --> 1:28:52.979
Again, our top story tonight,
Finley Hart is watching us--

1:28:53.023 --> 1:28:54.590
We're taking you
on a journey to the--

1:28:54.633 --> 1:28:57.506
Yes. You guys have like
MTV Cribshere, so...

1:28:57.549 --> 1:28:59.769
Show me where Tony's gonna be
sitting at a piano?

1:28:59.812 --> 1:29:01.379
Can you move in
a little closer?

1:29:01.423 --> 1:29:03.729
- Right here, honey.
- Yeah. That's great.

1:29:03.773 --> 1:29:05.775
Is that what you want?
- That's beautiful. Beautiful.

1:29:05.818 --> 1:29:07.646
Yeah. Love that. Yeah.

1:29:11.041 --> 1:29:14.566
Problem resetting,
still rolling,
one more time. Here we go.

1:29:16.263 --> 1:29:17.700
- Good morning, Ms. Schultz.
- Morning.

1:29:17.743 --> 1:29:20.006
Next time you schedule
a conference call

1:29:20.050 --> 1:29:24.054
at the crack of dawn for me,
my hourly rate will double.

1:29:25.447 --> 1:29:28.101
...moving objects, people.

1:29:28.145 --> 1:29:31.322
A device your father
developed in secret.

1:29:33.063 --> 1:29:34.717
She said, uh,
I lost connection.

1:29:34.760 --> 1:29:37.502
Can-- can--
can you guys hear me?

1:29:37.546 --> 1:29:41.376
Like-- that's-- let's pick
something like that up to--

1:29:47.686 --> 1:29:51.081
State your name, title,
or former title for the group.

1:29:51.124 --> 1:29:55.085
Title? Uh, I don't have
a title or position.

1:29:55.128 --> 1:29:57.435
Does somebody wanna tell me
what the hell is going on here?

1:29:57.479 --> 1:30:01.047
I mean-- I mean, Chris, um,
smaller with the eye movements

1:30:01.091 --> 1:30:03.833
as well, across the stream
because when you turn your head,

1:30:03.876 --> 1:30:07.140
it looks like you're looking at,
like, three different monitors.

1:30:07.184 --> 1:30:09.055
Standby...

1:30:09.099 --> 1:30:11.493
- Sorry.
- We're just calling Ed
right now, Stella,

1:30:11.536 --> 1:30:12.972
One quick second.

1:30:13.016 --> 1:30:14.626
- Yeah.

1:30:15.497 --> 1:30:17.281
Hello?

1:30:17.324 --> 1:30:19.588
Are you calling...

1:30:19.631 --> 1:30:22.460
- So sorry.
- Sorry.

1:30:22.504 --> 1:30:24.419
You hear something
at the window,

1:30:24.462 --> 1:30:26.116
and you get up
and take your phone with you.

1:30:26.159 --> 1:30:27.987
...minutes to input.

1:30:28.031 --> 1:30:30.076
- Uh, where-- where is he going?
- I'm just getting my water,

1:30:30.120 --> 1:30:31.426
if that's okay with you.

1:30:38.868 --> 1:30:40.652
Hakan, are you still with us?

1:30:43.350 --> 1:30:47.224
There's some lunatic here,
staring into my window.

1:30:47.267 --> 1:30:50.140
And then,
you hold up your iPhone,
as if you're gonna film the guy.

1:30:50.183 --> 1:30:52.229
Who's that on the left
of the screen? Who's that?

1:30:52.272 --> 1:30:54.274
- It's the writer right here.
- Hi.

1:30:54.318 --> 1:30:56.886
Hey, hey, I'm sorry.
I-- I hope I-- I didn't take

1:30:56.929 --> 1:30:58.801
too much liberty
from your writing.

1:30:58.844 --> 1:31:01.499
It-- it can be scary
if someone disappears,

1:31:01.543 --> 1:31:04.197
but we-- all of a sudden,
the technology sends us
to that room,

1:31:04.241 --> 1:31:07.505
and we don't-- But they're
not there why is that?

1:31:07.549 --> 1:31:11.074
And then,
just hear the sound coming in,
and the sound going off.

1:31:11.117 --> 1:31:14.381
And then, that just becomes
more scary, you know?

1:31:33.531 --> 1:31:35.881
I have this--
this thing going on.

1:31:35.925 --> 1:31:38.841
Oh, okay. Yeah.
No, uh, no, you-- yes--

1:31:38.884 --> 1:31:41.234
But across the mark,
you wanna leave at zero.

1:31:41.278 --> 1:31:46.457
Supposed to be around
2,500 or less, if possible,

1:31:46.501 --> 1:31:47.719
but 2,500 should be...

1:31:47.763 --> 1:31:49.416
Placement of
the security camera.

1:31:49.460 --> 1:31:51.331
Can we not just
move that and, like,

1:31:51.375 --> 1:31:53.595
that angle Alex just showed us.
Alex, turn your camera back

1:31:53.638 --> 1:31:55.858
to like what it
would look like.

1:31:55.901 --> 1:31:58.295
That looks pretty awesome
as a backdrop.

1:31:58.338 --> 1:32:00.079
God, I love this song.

1:32:00.123 --> 1:32:03.474
"
by Rupert Holmes playing]

1:32:03.518 --> 1:32:07.696
I've got...
♪ If you like piña coladas

1:32:07.739 --> 1:32:10.089
- ...in my head.
- Oh, man.

1:32:10.133 --> 1:32:15.225
So, uh-- Oh, look at that.
Tony's calling me, actually.

1:32:15.268 --> 1:32:19.142
- Of course.

1:32:19.185 --> 1:32:21.144
I'll call him back
after this.

1:32:21.187 --> 1:32:25.235
Um, so he's not in
the room with you, is he?

1:32:33.330 --> 1:32:38.944
It's meant to with the GoPro
is we can effectively, like,

1:32:38.988 --> 1:32:43.514
tape it to the top of a phone,
and he can be--

1:32:43.558 --> 1:32:48.127
And like, somebody can be
on a Skype call
with the other actors,

1:32:48.171 --> 1:32:50.826
but recording
themselves with the GoPro.

1:32:50.869 --> 1:32:52.175
What is it?

1:32:52.218 --> 1:32:53.350
Call the Foundation.

1:32:54.612 --> 1:32:56.658
- Why?
- It's not here.

1:32:56.701 --> 1:32:58.007
Call the Foundation.
Do it right now.

1:32:59.182 --> 1:33:01.184
Riku, it's gone, it's empty.

1:33:01.227 --> 1:33:02.228
Look, it's empty.

1:33:06.798 --> 1:33:11.673
You want it up high?
I really push it up.

1:33:11.716 --> 1:33:14.284
- Yeah.
- Four feet higher than my head.

1:33:20.420 --> 1:33:25.208
Go. Ready, and--
Hey, Omar, come on, buddy.

1:33:25.251 --> 1:33:27.514
You did agree to it.

1:33:27.558 --> 1:33:31.475
No. I never agreed to that,
and I never will.

1:33:31.518 --> 1:33:34.826
Tilt your laptop down
so I can see
the set a little bit?

1:33:34.870 --> 1:33:36.872
Like, if you-- okay.

1:33:43.530 --> 1:33:45.402
When they're in the box,

1:33:45.445 --> 1:33:48.623
and they get the card out
there should be a QR code,

1:33:48.666 --> 1:33:51.669
so they have to
pick up their phone,
and scan the QR code,

1:33:51.713 --> 1:33:54.367
because that can be
the reason to actually see

1:33:54.411 --> 1:33:56.718
what they're scanning,
and see what it says.

1:33:56.761 --> 1:33:59.938
You know, we never
see enough of the laptop
to notice who it is.

1:33:59.982 --> 1:34:02.114
We just know that mother
and daughter together,

1:34:02.158 --> 1:34:05.117
they usually go as one,
she just asked if her daughter
had a laptop.

1:34:05.161 --> 1:34:07.032
And I'm rerouting.

1:34:08.730 --> 1:34:12.255
Are you really married
to an adult?

1:34:26.661 --> 1:34:28.924
What essentially
we would wanna do,

1:34:28.967 --> 1:34:32.710
is we would score
the 92 minutes, um,

1:34:32.754 --> 1:34:37.236
with a brain wave
frequency matrix

1:34:37.280 --> 1:34:41.284
that would help to
further enhance the emotion

1:34:41.327 --> 1:34:43.852
that's being captured
on the screen,

1:34:43.895 --> 1:34:46.202
as you're going through
different scenes.

1:34:58.083 --> 1:35:00.695
That was awesome.
TJ killed it.

1:35:03.480 --> 1:35:06.004
I hope that water pipe's
not gonna break now.

1:35:15.013 --> 1:35:16.754
Let's give it up for Alex, man.

1:35:16.798 --> 1:35:18.321
- Absolutely.
- Yeah.

1:35:18.364 --> 1:35:19.801
Alex, man.
You've killed it, dude.

1:35:22.064 --> 1:35:25.023
Riveting performance
over Zoom.

1:35:25.067 --> 1:35:27.809
- Oh, my God.

1:35:27.852 --> 1:35:32.030
Everybody can come
off of their muted,
uh, video screens here.

1:35:32.074 --> 1:35:36.121
And give it up for Jim
for joining us,
for having patience with us,

1:35:36.165 --> 1:35:38.254
and for knocking it
out of the park.

1:35:38.297 --> 1:35:41.561
Really well done, sir.
We'll cut it there.

1:35:41.605 --> 1:35:44.477
- Yay.
- Great work. Great work.

1:35:44.521 --> 1:35:47.263
Wow. Yeah!

1:35:48.525 --> 1:35:50.048
Yeah, buddy!

1:35:52.442 --> 1:35:55.706
I will put the crown
of-- of great performance

1:35:55.750 --> 1:35:57.186
back on your head,
once that one's off.

1:35:57.229 --> 1:36:00.842
Oh hey.

1:36:00.885 --> 1:36:04.236
You as well, as we float
down that long river...

1:36:04.280 --> 1:36:08.110
of all our happy yesterdays.

1:36:08.153 --> 1:36:10.503
Ta-ta. Bye-bye.
