01:28.701 --> 01:30.333
What's wrong
with Daddy?

01:30.367 --> 01:33.166
Ah, he's just
payin' bills.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.934
Nothin' to concern us.

01:35.968 --> 01:37.600
Just be happy he's
not banging his head

01:37.634 --> 01:39.533
against the table.

01:44.133 --> 01:47.533
Well, I'm signing now, Lord.

01:47.567 --> 01:51.167
Please just smite me
before I get to the Y in Bundy.

01:51.734 --> 01:54.166
Oh, give me
that pen.

01:54.200 --> 01:55.600
"Bundy."

01:55.634 --> 02:00.600
Heh. Yet another thing
you start that I finish.

02:01.267 --> 02:03.266
Well, now that
that's done,

02:03.300 --> 02:04.934
how 'bout taking us
to the movies?

02:04.968 --> 02:06.200
Well, perhaps you were fooled

02:06.234 --> 02:10.233
by the opulent luxury
of our home.

02:10.267 --> 02:12.266
You see, believe it or not,
we're broke.

02:12.300 --> 02:14.133
Now, I know I've said
we're broke before,

02:14.167 --> 02:17.900
and you've all been
very brave and spent anyway,

02:17.934 --> 02:20.366
but it's really time
to tighten our belts.

02:20.400 --> 02:22.500
Now, Peg, what can you
do without?

02:22.534 --> 02:25.101
Apparently an orgasm.

02:27.400 --> 02:29.368
Heh.

02:30.834 --> 02:33.468
Way to get one.

02:35.033 --> 02:36.533
Kelly, and you?

02:36.567 --> 02:40.234
Well, I think that we all
could do without war, Daddy.

02:41.868 --> 02:44.467
Now do you think you
should have gained
more than five pounds

02:44.501 --> 02:47.333
when you were pregnant
with her?

02:47.367 --> 02:49.500
Now, there must be
somebody around here

02:49.534 --> 02:51.366
that can think of some way
to save money.

02:51.400 --> 02:53.999
Hey, Dad, I got my license.

02:54.033 --> 02:56.468
Can I have a new car?

02:56.834 --> 02:57.800
Daddy's broke.

02:57.834 --> 02:59.166
You're gonna have
to ask Mommy

02:59.200 --> 03:00.900
to get one for you.

03:00.934 --> 03:02.433
Mommy, can I have a new car?

03:02.467 --> 03:04.468
Sure you can.

03:05.567 --> 03:07.733
Oh, what the hell,
new cars for everyone.

03:07.767 --> 03:09.834
That's wonderful!

03:09.868 --> 03:13.099
Quiet,
you morons!

03:13.133 --> 03:15.366
There's gonna be no new cars
and no new drivers.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.166
I already can't
afford insurance,

03:17.200 --> 03:19.834
what with Kelly here
and the U-turn queen.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.900
You know, it's not my fault
that they always put the sales

03:25.934 --> 03:28.166
on the other side
of the street.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.700
Dad, all my friends
are driving.

03:30.734 --> 03:32.767
Well, if all your friends
were getting married,

03:32.801 --> 03:35.400
would you do that too?

03:35.434 --> 03:36.467
Look, forget a car.

03:36.501 --> 03:37.767
There's no reason
to take one

03:37.801 --> 03:41.134
when you can take
a perfectly good bus.

03:42.100 --> 03:43.966
Oh, yeah. I'd look
real cool picking up

03:44.000 --> 03:46.999
that special date
in the old bus.

03:47.033 --> 03:48.567
Hey, you know what
all the guys say:

03:48.601 --> 03:52.334
"For a handful of girl,
give the bus a whirl."

03:59.033 --> 04:01.033
Oh, come on, Al.

04:01.067 --> 04:02.900
You were worried
about Kelly driving,

04:02.934 --> 04:04.133
and in the past year,

04:04.167 --> 04:07.334
she's only gotten
two or three tickets.

04:08.834 --> 04:09.966
And it would
have been four

04:10.000 --> 04:13.334
if I hadn't outran
those last cops.

04:13.934 --> 04:15.867
Yep, they were fast enough
to keep up with me

04:15.901 --> 04:17.934
goin' the wrong way
on the expressway,

04:17.968 --> 04:22.433
but when it came time
to jump that drawbridge,

04:22.467 --> 04:25.767
they just didn't have
the guts.

04:25.801 --> 04:27.433
Well, I guess that solves
the mystery

04:27.467 --> 04:30.734
of the bullet hole
in my gas tank.

04:31.133 --> 04:32.400
Look, Bud,
how 'bout this?

04:32.434 --> 04:34.667
Whenever you want to go
someplace, I'll take you.

04:34.701 --> 04:36.133
Huh? It'll be fun.

04:36.167 --> 04:37.600
And that way
the skirts will think

04:37.634 --> 04:40.201
I'm just one
of your cool friends.

04:40.701 --> 04:41.834
Oh, yeah.

04:41.868 --> 04:43.934
Then you could even have
a cool nickname,

04:43.968 --> 04:46.633
like Jowl Boy.

04:47.534 --> 04:48.999
Son, let this be
a lesson to you.

04:49.033 --> 04:50.500
Never do tequila shooters

04:50.534 --> 04:53.500
within a country mile
of a marriage chapel.

05:10.234 --> 05:12.533
Fly.

05:16.701 --> 05:19.067
Tapeworm.

05:27.534 --> 05:28.800
What's that?

05:28.834 --> 05:31.066
Oh, that's Dad's
car stereo.

05:31.100 --> 05:32.667
Since we've been
cruisin' together,

05:32.701 --> 05:35.200
he let me fix it up
a little.

05:35.234 --> 05:38.867
Fifteen-hundred watts
and no volume control.

05:40.968 --> 05:42.066
With the right song,

05:42.100 --> 05:44.966
you can drop a bird
at a hundred yards.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.667
Cool.

05:47.367 --> 05:49.600
Hey, Daddy, can I use
the car tonight?

05:49.634 --> 05:51.700
What?

05:51.734 --> 05:53.533
What?

05:53.567 --> 05:55.767
Mom, Daddy's
deaf again!

05:55.801 --> 05:58.834
Oh, I'll fix it.

06:10.200 --> 06:11.767
Is that your way
of telling me, uh,

06:11.801 --> 06:13.434
we're out of Q-tips?

06:14.267 --> 06:16.266
Oh, honey, if it's good enough
for the toilet,

06:16.300 --> 06:19.400
they're good enough
for you.

06:19.434 --> 06:20.733
So how was your day,
sweetie?

06:20.767 --> 06:22.033
Oh, fine.

06:22.067 --> 06:24.500
Just me cruising around,
listening to the oldies channel

06:24.534 --> 06:26.867
at 1500 watts.

06:27.734 --> 06:29.533
Made a lot of new friends.

06:29.567 --> 06:32.800
Take, uh, Officer Lewis,
for example.

06:32.834 --> 06:35.867
Unfortunately, I couldn't hear
his siren at first, but luckily,

06:35.901 --> 06:38.099
police cars are now equipped
with rammers

06:38.133 --> 06:41.467
that gently ease me
into the rail.

06:41.501 --> 06:43.166
Luckily, the cop liked oldies,

06:43.200 --> 06:44.567
so he beat me
with his nightstick

06:44.601 --> 06:47.201
to the tune of "Hey Jude."

06:48.968 --> 06:51.633
Then he wrote me up 18 tickets.

06:51.667 --> 06:55.934
Including the one
for bleeding on his pad.

06:55.968 --> 06:58.600
How was your day?

06:58.634 --> 07:00.934
Quit whining, Dad.

07:00.968 --> 07:04.067
Put on the Bon Jovi hair,
and let's roll.

07:12.901 --> 07:14.733
Gee, honey,

07:14.767 --> 07:16.967
you look like Tarzan.

07:18.100 --> 07:20.867
If he was old and gay.

07:23.701 --> 07:25.400
Well, Peg,
if you were Jane,

07:25.434 --> 07:28.001
believe me,
he would be.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.366
Come on, son.
Let's roll.

07:33.400 --> 07:34.633
No way.

07:34.667 --> 07:36.400
The car's mine tonight.

07:36.434 --> 07:37.567
Come on, Daddy.

07:37.601 --> 07:39.433
If not, I have to stand
on a street corner

07:39.467 --> 07:41.834
and listen to guys yell
insulting and degrading remarks

07:41.868 --> 07:43.900
and make kissing sounds.

07:43.934 --> 07:47.667
I'm sorry, honey.
We didn't know that was you.

07:53.100 --> 07:54.133
No, forget it, Kel.

07:54.167 --> 07:55.867
That car
is mine tonight.

07:55.901 --> 07:56.999
Mine.
Mine!

07:57.033 --> 07:58.066
Mine!

07:58.100 --> 08:00.800
Now, that's enough,
devil dogs.

08:00.834 --> 08:02.600
Now, I can't take
any more of this.

08:02.634 --> 08:04.200
I'm gonna get
car insurance for him,

08:04.234 --> 08:07.134
and you two can fight
over the car to the death.

08:13.133 --> 08:17.500
Hello. Jim's Fish, Chips
and Insurance?

08:17.534 --> 08:19.633
Al Bundy here. Hi, Jim.

08:19.667 --> 08:23.066
Uh, listen, how much to put
my son on my insurance?

08:23.100 --> 08:24.767
How old? Um...

08:24.801 --> 08:25.834
Sixteen.

08:25.868 --> 08:28.667
Uh, he's 16.

08:28.701 --> 08:31.400
Whoa!

08:31.434 --> 08:32.966
If you think
I'm gonna pay that much,

08:33.000 --> 08:36.933
you're as stupid as those cats
you trap and call "tuna."

08:40.400 --> 08:42.133
You know, when you insult
my wife, Jim,

08:42.167 --> 08:44.600
you don't hurt me, pal.

08:48.000 --> 08:49.633
Well, what'd he say, Al?

08:49.667 --> 08:52.500
Nothing I haven't said myself.

08:53.100 --> 08:54.467
Now, look, Jim,

08:54.501 --> 08:56.700
if that's the best you can do
for a lifetime friend

08:56.734 --> 08:58.300
and someone who never told
the police

08:58.334 --> 08:59.966
what your "catch of the day"
really is,

09:00.000 --> 09:02.166
then you can just take
my insurance and stuff it.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.867
That's right, all of it!

09:05.467 --> 09:06.600
There, family.

09:06.634 --> 09:08.500
Al Bundy takes guff
from no one.

09:08.534 --> 09:10.999
Cheap, cheap, cheap,
cheap, cheap, cheap...

09:11.033 --> 09:12.767
All right, I'm going
to give you the keys.

09:12.801 --> 09:14.033
It's mine.
Look out.

09:14.067 --> 09:15.300
Out of the way.
Give it to me.

09:15.334 --> 09:16.400
Me! Me! Me!
Look out.
Me!

09:16.434 --> 09:17.900
Look out.
Now, hold it!

09:17.934 --> 09:19.266
Just remember:

09:19.300 --> 09:21.266
the one who drives,
be very careful,

09:21.300 --> 09:23.133
because as you know,
we don't have any car--

09:23.167 --> 09:24.233
Give me those!
Look out.

09:24.267 --> 09:25.433
Now, hold it!

09:25.467 --> 09:27.500
Be very careful
because we don't have any--

09:27.534 --> 09:29.234
Ah, the hell...

09:33.567 --> 09:36.033
Well, at least
my pain is gone.

09:36.067 --> 09:38.900
Al?
Oops.

09:39.767 --> 09:43.166
Honey, you know, I may just be
the wife of a moron,

09:43.200 --> 09:45.600
but isn't canceling
our insurance

09:45.634 --> 09:47.767
and giving the car keys
to two teenagers

09:47.801 --> 09:49.200
the work of, well,

09:49.234 --> 09:52.233
the Dalai Lama
of morons?

09:52.267 --> 09:54.166
Peg, we don't
need insurance.

09:54.200 --> 09:55.433
Insurance
is like marriage:

09:55.467 --> 09:57.533
You pay, pay, you never
get anything back.

09:57.567 --> 09:59.533
Besides-- Besides,
the car isn't worth more

09:59.567 --> 10:02.467
than 100 bucks
with both kids in it.

10:02.501 --> 10:04.500
Peg, I'm a real hero.

10:04.534 --> 10:06.700
For once, there's
one man brave enough

10:06.734 --> 10:09.734
to stand up and say he doesn't
need any stinking car--

10:10.434 --> 10:12.401
Oh!

10:14.434 --> 10:15.533
Is that my car?

10:15.567 --> 10:17.500
Yeah.

10:17.534 --> 10:18.900
Are the kids hurt?

10:18.934 --> 10:21.600
No. Whew.

10:22.467 --> 10:25.067
Then I have
to do it myself.

10:34.033 --> 10:35.966
Gee, what a wreck.

10:36.000 --> 10:38.900
A 500SL Mercedes.

10:38.934 --> 10:42.099
You had to hit
a $100,000 Mercedes?

10:42.133 --> 10:43.500
You know, it's amazing.

10:43.534 --> 10:48.767
<i>Your Dodge, with the high
Blue Book value of $70,</i>

10:48.801 --> 10:53.233
sliced right through
that Kraut car like toast.

10:53.267 --> 10:55.900
I'm tellin' you,
it is times like these

10:55.934 --> 10:59.099
that I am proud
to be an American.

10:59.133 --> 11:01.700
Oh. That's good, Peg.

11:01.734 --> 11:03.400
Then it'll be your job
to make sure

11:03.434 --> 11:05.300
Old Glory is flying
high above our heads

11:05.334 --> 11:08.301
as we wait in line
for free cheese.

11:09.133 --> 11:10.999
Oh, how much could it cost
to fix it, huh?

11:11.033 --> 11:13.600
A half a mil?

11:13.634 --> 11:14.800
And you know he's gonna sue.

11:14.834 --> 11:16.500
That's the problem
with America today.

11:16.534 --> 11:18.867
There's jerks out there
everywhere, suing for nothin'.

11:18.901 --> 11:20.266
He hit me, Dad.

11:20.300 --> 11:22.434
We're suing.

11:23.200 --> 11:26.233
Peg, get the kids
some neck braces.

11:26.267 --> 11:27.999
But, Daddy,
we weren't hurt.

11:28.033 --> 11:30.533
Why can't you be more
like your brother? Huh?

11:30.567 --> 11:32.999
You don't hear him
whining he's not hurt.

11:33.033 --> 11:36.366
Al. Honey, you know
we can't win a lawsuit.

11:36.400 --> 11:37.567
Why, ever since

11:37.601 --> 11:39.767
<i>Bundy v. the Girl Scouts
of America,</i>

11:39.801 --> 11:44.333
when you claimed to have choked
on a bone in a butter cookie,

11:44.367 --> 11:46.500
no judge has ever believed
a Bundy.

11:46.534 --> 11:47.934
Like I ever had
a chance.

11:47.968 --> 11:50.667
Peg, as God as my witness,
that judge's breath smelled

11:50.701 --> 11:52.667
of free chocolate mints.

11:52.701 --> 11:54.366
Let's face it, Al.

11:54.400 --> 11:57.400
Our only chance is
if we had a reliable witness.

11:57.434 --> 11:58.433
Oh, God.

11:58.467 --> 11:59.999
You wanna hear something funny?

12:00.033 --> 12:02.233
This car phone was lying
by my house,

12:02.267 --> 12:03.999
and a policeman came over
and asked me

12:04.033 --> 12:05.533
which car I thought
it came from:

12:05.567 --> 12:08.167
the Mercedes or the Dodge.

12:10.367 --> 12:12.600
He thought
it could be yours.

12:13.467 --> 12:17.300
Oh, a shoe salesman
with a car phone.

12:17.334 --> 12:18.500
What's that?

12:18.534 --> 12:21.567
A woman across town
needs a 7 triple E?

12:21.601 --> 12:23.900
I'm on my way.

12:27.734 --> 12:29.200
Oh.

12:29.234 --> 12:31.433
Who would have thought
seeing an accident like that

12:31.467 --> 12:32.500
would be
so much fun?

12:32.534 --> 12:33.633
You saw it?

12:33.667 --> 12:35.500
Yeah. I saw the whole thing
from the car

12:35.534 --> 12:37.200
while I was saying
good night to my date.

12:37.234 --> 12:39.733
Oh, Al, a non-Bundy
as a witness.

12:39.767 --> 12:41.133
They'll believe her.

12:41.167 --> 12:42.533
But, Peg,
do you think a judge

12:42.567 --> 12:45.368
will believe that
she had a date?

12:46.734 --> 12:49.633
Honey, we could
actually be rich.

12:49.667 --> 12:51.867
All those years of pain
and suffering and--

12:51.901 --> 12:53.934
And the humiliation
of having people call me

12:53.968 --> 12:56.133
"Mrs. Bundy" to my face

12:56.167 --> 12:57.533
are finally through.

12:57.567 --> 12:59.533
Oh, kids,
go to your sickbeds,

12:59.567 --> 13:02.400
for tomorrow,
we sue.

13:02.434 --> 13:05.867
Whoa, Bundy!

13:05.901 --> 13:07.867
Good night.
We're gonna be rich.

13:20.601 --> 13:22.400
Another accident case?

13:22.434 --> 13:23.767
Great.

13:23.801 --> 13:26.066
I just hope it's not one
of those frivolous lawsuits.

13:26.100 --> 13:27.667
Make way. Make way.

13:27.701 --> 13:31.001
A crippled family
coming through.

13:38.934 --> 13:41.034
Rum.

13:48.200 --> 13:50.934
<i>The case
of Bundy v. Fitzwilley.</i>

13:50.968 --> 13:53.066
And Dr. Fitzwilley
is suing the Bundys

13:53.100 --> 13:54.867
for a million dollars.

13:54.901 --> 13:57.333
The Bundys are countersuing
for...

13:57.367 --> 14:00.934
a jillion dollars.

14:03.868 --> 14:06.667
In cash, Your Honor.

14:07.100 --> 14:09.066
Mr. Bundy, before we begin,

14:09.100 --> 14:11.934
could you tell me why your wife
is wearing a neck brace

14:11.968 --> 14:14.433
when she wasn't involved
in the accident?

14:14.467 --> 14:16.233
Uh, let me answer that,
Your Honor.

14:16.267 --> 14:19.800
You see,
it's sex whiplash.

14:19.834 --> 14:22.033
But it is accident-related.

14:22.067 --> 14:24.266
You see, my husband
got so excited

14:24.300 --> 14:25.667
over this jillion dollars

14:25.701 --> 14:27.900
that he, uh, just
lost control of himself

14:27.934 --> 14:29.633
last night in bed.

14:30.667 --> 14:31.834
Ah.

14:31.868 --> 14:35.267
He kind of caught me
off guard. Heh-heh.

14:36.334 --> 14:38.734
He moved. Heh.

14:45.300 --> 14:47.533
Mr. Bundy,
opening statement?

14:47.567 --> 14:50.133
Thank you, Your Honor.

14:50.167 --> 14:52.400
And may I add that it's nice
to see a woman in a robe

14:52.434 --> 14:56.900
who's not wearing fuzzy slippers
and a bag of Doritos in her lap.

14:59.701 --> 15:00.867
And now--

15:00.901 --> 15:03.567
-- on to the lawsuit.

15:03.601 --> 15:08.200
While carrying canned goods
to their local church group,

15:08.234 --> 15:09.333
my beloved children,

15:09.367 --> 15:14.099
Bud and, uh...
the girl,

15:14.133 --> 15:16.600
had their futures
maliciously torn asunder

15:16.634 --> 15:20.066
by the merciless destruction
of an Aryan super-car.

15:20.100 --> 15:21.099
This, Your Honor,

15:21.133 --> 15:24.734
is the nightmare
of your unified Germany.

15:25.033 --> 15:26.633
Thanks to my witness,

15:26.667 --> 15:30.333
a professional banker
and brother woman,

15:30.367 --> 15:31.999
we plan to prove

15:32.033 --> 15:34.200
that we deserve
a jillion dollars

15:34.234 --> 15:35.767
in cash,

15:35.801 --> 15:40.667
and we humbly await
your decision.

15:40.701 --> 15:41.966
So, Mrs. Rhoades,

15:42.000 --> 15:44.266
you say you witnessed
the accident.

15:44.300 --> 15:45.567
Yes, I did.
Mm-hm.

15:45.601 --> 15:46.934
And where were you?

15:46.968 --> 15:48.099
In my driveway.

15:48.133 --> 15:49.966
I was saying good night
to my date in his car.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.467
Mm-hm. And could you describe

15:51.501 --> 15:52.800
how you saw the accident?

15:52.834 --> 15:56.033
Well, we picked
our heads up, and we--

15:56.067 --> 15:58.266
Picked your heads up.

15:58.300 --> 16:00.500
Where were your heads
that you picked them up?

16:00.534 --> 16:02.567
Well...

16:02.601 --> 16:04.267
Down.

16:05.501 --> 16:07.400
Hey, I know
what you're thinking.

16:07.434 --> 16:10.867
But let me set you straight.
It was not our first date.

16:12.100 --> 16:13.533
And I would like
the record to show

16:13.567 --> 16:14.934
that he bought me
dinner first,

16:14.968 --> 16:18.166
and he called me
the next day.

16:18.200 --> 16:21.334
And who are you to judge me?

16:27.667 --> 16:29.900
You know what it's like
out there in the dating world,

16:29.934 --> 16:32.200
being smarter than the man
but being unable to show it?

16:32.234 --> 16:34.733
Where is the harm?
Where is the harm?

16:34.767 --> 16:36.066
So, Mrs. Rhoades,

16:36.100 --> 16:38.300
you didn't really see
who was at fault, did you?

16:38.334 --> 16:40.066
No.

16:40.100 --> 16:42.200
But the Mercedes had to be.

16:42.234 --> 16:44.567
My ex-husband drove a Mercedes.

16:45.434 --> 16:47.567
You may step down,
Mrs. Rhoades.

16:47.601 --> 16:49.233
He left me like
the parsley on a plate

16:49.267 --> 16:52.467
at a truck-stop diner.

16:52.501 --> 16:54.900
He loved that damn car
more than he loved me.

16:54.934 --> 16:55.966
Bailiff.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.600
They have to stop making
those cars,

16:57.634 --> 16:58.700
don't you see?

16:58.734 --> 17:00.467
They're evil.
They tell the man:

17:00.501 --> 17:01.867
"You don't need a wife.

17:01.901 --> 17:02.966
"You're a cool guy.

17:03.000 --> 17:04.599
Look at that teenager
over there."

17:04.634 --> 17:06.532
It's not the men.
It's the cars.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.066
I'm warning you,
America,

17:08.099 --> 17:10.066
keep your husbands
out of German cars!

17:10.099 --> 17:11.999
<i>Ask me what
fahrvergnügen means!</i>

17:12.032 --> 17:14.300
I'll tell you! I--

17:19.601 --> 17:20.867
So, Miss Bundy,

17:20.901 --> 17:23.900
the accident cost you
your sight?

17:29.200 --> 17:33.368
Yes. I am blind
like the mighty oak.

17:33.801 --> 17:35.533
Miss Bundy,

17:35.567 --> 17:37.834
how many fingers
am I holding up?

17:37.868 --> 17:40.333
Oh, you're not gonna
catch me with that one.

17:40.367 --> 17:42.301
I'm blind.

17:43.968 --> 17:45.600
All right.

17:45.634 --> 17:47.433
Would you please
point out the man

17:47.467 --> 17:50.099
who hit your car
and blinded you?

17:50.133 --> 17:53.266
Sure. It is that guy
right there with the gray suit

17:53.300 --> 17:56.368
and the little Band-Aid
on his head.

18:00.834 --> 18:03.434
You may step down.

18:10.400 --> 18:11.934
Mr. Bundy--

18:11.968 --> 18:16.134
Uh, please, uh,
just call me Big B.

18:17.000 --> 18:18.533
No.

18:19.334 --> 18:23.134
Mr. Bundy, I bet
you're a good driver.

18:23.801 --> 18:26.400
Ninety-eight
on the written test, babe.

18:26.434 --> 18:28.567
My boy's
a winner, Peg.

18:28.601 --> 18:31.533
Not like your girl.

18:31.567 --> 18:34.834
Brush your teeth,
honey.

18:34.868 --> 18:39.201
Now, you're
a fine young man. Hm.

18:40.901 --> 18:42.366
Do you know what they do

18:42.400 --> 18:46.034
to fine young men
in the big house?

18:47.968 --> 18:51.867
That's right, Big B.

18:51.901 --> 18:55.300
And that's where you're headed
if you perjure yourself.

18:55.334 --> 18:57.966
So I ask you one time
and one time only:

18:58.000 --> 19:01.166
how did this accident occur?

19:01.200 --> 19:02.733
We were playing Eyesies-Closies,

19:02.767 --> 19:05.200
and my sister put her hands
over my eyes and I couldn't see,

19:05.234 --> 19:07.999
and I hit the gas,
and I heard a terrible crash.

19:08.033 --> 19:11.967
But the part about us being hurt
was the idea of that man.

19:19.100 --> 19:20.600
Come on, Al.

19:20.634 --> 19:24.166
Ya only owe $50,000.

19:24.200 --> 19:27.700
And you have a whole month
to pay it off.

19:27.734 --> 19:29.500
Now, show some gumption.

19:29.534 --> 19:31.999
You know what we say back home
in Wanker County?

19:32.033 --> 19:36.101
"Nothin' spells lovin'
like marryin' your cousin"?

19:38.367 --> 19:39.467
No.

19:39.501 --> 19:41.867
When times are tough,
we pull together.

19:41.901 --> 19:43.099
So I'll tell you what,

19:43.133 --> 19:45.200
Bud and Kelly and I
are gonna go to the movies

19:45.234 --> 19:47.133
and leave you alone
to think in peace.

19:47.167 --> 19:49.834
Come on, kids.

19:50.801 --> 19:52.600
Dad,

19:52.634 --> 19:57.201
I can't help but feel somehow
responsible for this.

19:59.734 --> 20:00.867
Aw, son, come here

20:00.901 --> 20:04.101
and let me choke you
till you feel better.

20:04.934 --> 20:06.700
Well, you're not mad at me,
are you, Daddy?

20:06.734 --> 20:08.233
No, pumpkin.

20:08.267 --> 20:11.533
How many fists
am I holdin' up?

20:12.400 --> 20:14.233
Oh, don't worry, Al.

20:14.267 --> 20:16.099
We'll all pitch in
and help.

20:16.133 --> 20:17.999
Why, Bud can
sell newspapers,

20:18.033 --> 20:19.999
and Kelly can, uh,

20:20.033 --> 20:22.834
twirl around
till she gets dizzy.

20:22.868 --> 20:25.366
And I can play
my accordion at parties.

20:25.400 --> 20:26.567
And then all
you have to do

20:26.601 --> 20:29.033
is come up with
the rest of the 50,000.

20:29.067 --> 20:30.900
You know, I really think
this is gonna bring

20:30.934 --> 20:32.366
our family
much closer together.

20:32.400 --> 20:33.800
Mm-hm.
Come on.

20:33.834 --> 20:35.667
Mom, do I really have
to sell newspapers?

20:35.701 --> 20:38.500
No. I was just
sayin' that.

20:41.067 --> 20:44.567
Fifty-thousand dollars.

20:44.601 --> 20:46.967
Thirty days.

20:50.300 --> 20:52.333
Well, you know what they say.

20:52.367 --> 20:55.700
When the going gets tough,

20:55.734 --> 20:59.434
the tough runs like a thief
in the night.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.500
Goodbye, Al Bundy.

21:03.534 --> 21:07.734
Hello to the mysterious stranger
in a logging camp.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.767
See you on the other side, boy.

21:11.801 --> 21:15.366
Well, a loggin' man needs
a loggin' dog.

21:15.400 --> 21:16.633
Come on, boy!

21:16.667 --> 21:18.500
* North to Alaska *

21:18.534 --> 21:20.667
* Where north
The rush is on *

21:20.701 --> 21:22.867
* Go north to Alaska *

21:22.901 --> 21:24.567
* Way north to-- *

21:24.601 --> 21:26.834
Unh!
