I'm sorry your fellow
prisoners and your saviors fled.

00:23.773 --> 00:26.710
I was looking forward
to 18 against one.

00:26.748 --> 00:30.084
Your lust for needless battle
eludes me.

00:32.816 --> 00:35.292
Let us end this.

00:43.032 --> 00:44.933
Mongul is neutralized.

00:45.001 --> 00:47.703
Forget Mongul.
Only the Key matters.

00:48.355 --> 00:52.380
The Crystal Key... Is gone.

00:55.545 --> 00:59.414
Our priority must now shift
to guarding the Key Chamber,

00:59.477 --> 01:01.885
so that whomever
stole the Key

01:01.952 --> 01:04.988
cannot use it to reactivate
the Warworld.

01:05.056 --> 01:10.127
Agreed. But the Justice League already
holds the Chamber for that exact purpose.

01:10.195 --> 01:15.989
And unfortunately, our Ambassador
has no appetite for direct confrontation.

01:16.028 --> 01:21.606
Our only choice is to patrol the Chamber's
perimeter like mere security guards.

01:21.673 --> 01:25.476
- It is galling.
- But, as with all Reach warriors...

01:25.503 --> 01:28.374
We live to serve.

01:43.173 --> 01:46.818
Look! I know this missing Key is
important, but we need to focus on...

01:46.857 --> 01:51.034
<i>Blue Beetle, the so-called Reach hero
has dominated this news cycle</i>

01:51.080 --> 01:55.241
<i>with U.N. Secretary General Tseng
announcing his plan to present Beetle</i>

01:55.273 --> 01:59.476
<i>with the International Medal of Valor
for saving the Earth from the Warworld.</i>

01:59.762 --> 02:01.897
That's a load of good press
for a traitor.

02:01.933 --> 02:03.484
Hey! Don't blame Blue.

02:03.525 --> 02:05.518
He's just much a captive
of the Reach as we were.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.642
We have to set him free.

02:09.219 --> 02:12.700
You know, before he conquers the Earth
and enslaves all mankind.

The Toyman's toys
don't come cheap.

02:43.412 --> 02:45.146
<i>In fact...</i>

02:45.154 --> 02:48.123
They break the bank!

02:52.054 --> 02:53.655
No, no!

03:00.235 --> 03:02.423
Hero, what...
He nearly got us killed!

03:02.490 --> 03:04.258
And the Reach stinks!

03:04.325 --> 03:08.141
No fair! I get the hero who took
down the Warworld single-handed?!

03:08.165 --> 03:10.934
This is Metropolis.
Where's Superman?

03:38.025 --> 03:40.527
Here you go, officers.

03:40.594 --> 03:43.507
Time to put the toy man
back on the shelf.

03:43.578 --> 03:46.200
No fair, no fair, no fair!

03:46.268 --> 03:47.935
Yeah, OK, yeah,
that was pretty cool.

03:48.003 --> 03:49.403
And the Reach is, though.

03:49.471 --> 03:51.602
Blue Beetle, Blue Beetle,
a moment?

03:51.626 --> 03:54.776
For the famed Cat Grant?
I'm at your service.

03:54.804 --> 03:58.881
<i>Heck, I'm at everyone's service.
That's just how I roll.</i>

03:58.948 --> 04:01.312
<i>So, you've begun
handling situations</i>

04:01.335 --> 04:04.365
<i>that, once upon a time,
were a job for Superman.</i>

04:04.389 --> 04:09.090
Hey, if the Justice League's too busy,
I'm happy to pick up the slack.

04:09.196 --> 04:10.897
<i>Why am I still waving?</i>

04:10.944 --> 04:14.424
<i>I look like an idiot!
Scarab, get us out of here!</i>

04:14.475 --> 04:18.944
<i>The Reach desires the crowd's adulation,
and we serve the Reach.</i>

04:19.012 --> 04:20.680
<i>Quite correct, scarab.</i>

04:20.747 --> 04:23.482
<i>Fighting human crime
is without benefit.</i>

04:23.550 --> 04:27.787
Making sure the crowd appreciates it?
Priceless.

04:27.854 --> 04:32.057
Given the recent negative publicity
over our hidden invasion fleet,

04:32.125 --> 04:35.528
it is fortunate your puppet
is appreciated at all.

04:35.595 --> 04:38.673
Please. The meat
loves their heroes.

04:38.697 --> 04:41.298
You worry too much, scientist.

04:44.437 --> 04:47.874
I am so honored
by your kind attentions...

04:47.941 --> 04:50.809
And so honored
to be your hero.

04:52.768 --> 04:55.715
<i>That's not the way I talk!
And stop waving!</i>

04:55.783 --> 04:57.850
<i>Look like
the Queen of England.</i>

04:58.262 --> 05:00.748
<i>Great, now I'm Peter Pan.</i>

05:01.555 --> 05:06.993
Uh, as your profile expands,
do you worry about increased scrutiny?

05:07.060 --> 05:08.828
Nah. I welcome it.

05:08.896 --> 05:11.104
Let 'em watch.

05:28.436 --> 05:31.696
<i>Hi, La'gaan.
I'm glad your leg's all healed.</i>

05:31.764 --> 05:36.936
<i>- Angel fish! You're here.
- I... Came to pick you up,</i>

05:37.004 --> 05:40.302
<i>- Bring you back to the surface world.
- That's so sweet.</i>

05:40.333 --> 05:42.608
<i>I was just going
to zeta back tomorrow.</i>

05:42.646 --> 05:46.513
<i>I thought we could use the trip
as an opportunity to... talk.</i>

05:46.581 --> 05:50.343
<i>To talk?
That's... Great.</i>

05:53.941 --> 05:56.891
<i>We will soon arrive
at your home, Jaime Reyes.</i>

05:56.959 --> 05:59.627
<i>Ugh, could we not?
Nothing's worse than watching</i>

05:59.695 --> 06:02.985
<i>you and the Ambassador pretend
to be me to my family.</i>

06:03.015 --> 06:06.017
<i>Any alternative tactic
would only endanger them.</i>

06:06.044 --> 06:07.511
<i>Congratulations, scarab.</i>

06:07.547 --> 06:10.048
<i>You took the words
right out of my mouth.</i>

06:14.377 --> 06:16.886
<i>Breech of defensive perimeter.</i>

06:18.243 --> 06:22.191
Batgirl?! What are you doing?
You know this won't hold us.

06:22.259 --> 06:25.887
- It'll hold for a couple seconds.
<i>- Batgirl, please!</i>

06:25.910 --> 06:27.630
<i>They're going
to make me hurt you!</i>

06:27.655 --> 06:30.567
<i>The Batgirl cannot hear
your true voice, Jaime Reyes.</i>

06:30.635 --> 06:33.905
- And a couple seconds...
- Is more than I need.

06:49.101 --> 06:51.289
Sweet dreams, Blue.

07:06.406 --> 07:08.874
<i>Scarab,
what are you waiting for?!</i>

07:08.942 --> 07:14.012
<i>I am establishing the Impulse's pattern of
movement, anticipating where he will be.</i>

07:14.080 --> 07:15.720
<i>Target point.</i>

07:18.985 --> 07:22.600
<i>OK, you're down.
You won. Let's go.</i>

07:22.639 --> 07:24.623
<i>I think not.</i>

07:24.691 --> 07:29.662
<i>As this street is currently deserted,
we must seize the opportunity.</i>

07:29.730 --> 07:33.876
<i>Scarab. Kill them both.</i>

07:45.196 --> 07:47.575
<i>Scarab!
You don't have to do this!</i>

07:47.607 --> 07:50.033
But he does.
And so do you.

07:50.072 --> 07:53.931
In fact, it will be a good lesson
for you to helplessly observe

07:53.966 --> 07:57.001
your own body murder
your former friends.

07:57.068 --> 08:00.801
The first kills are always
the hardest, my boy.

08:00.831 --> 08:02.639
<i>Might as well
get them over with.</i>

08:02.683 --> 08:07.478
<i>Scarab, please! We've fought side
by side with these guys. Do something!</i>

08:07.546 --> 08:10.921
<i>I must do
as designed parameters dictate.</i>

08:17.723 --> 08:19.657
Scarab!
Your attack is ineffective.

08:19.701 --> 08:24.178
- Analyze this containment field.
<i>- Analysis already complete.</i>

08:24.228 --> 08:28.062
<i>Field displays energy signature
consistent with the alien cooperative.</i>

08:28.098 --> 08:31.735
Cooperative technology
draws power from kinetic energy.

08:31.774 --> 08:35.171
The scarab's physical attack
is strengthening the force bubble.

08:35.239 --> 08:36.506
It should know this!

08:36.573 --> 08:41.424
Scarab! Do you have the means
to effectively circumvent this tech?

08:41.471 --> 08:45.508
<i>- I do. A side attack would...</i>
- Don't explain! Do it.

08:45.853 --> 08:49.345
[backwards spell]

08:53.706 --> 08:56.094
I've reinforced Rocket's
force bubble with my magics.

08:56.161 --> 08:59.847
Blue's not going anywhere.
[speaking backwards]

09:01.601 --> 09:05.221
<i>Ha! Don't you get it,
extraterrestre?</i>

09:05.252 --> 09:08.238
<i>Impulse and Batgirl were decoys.</i>

09:08.285 --> 09:11.549
<i>A distraction from Rocket
and Zatanna's real attack!</i>

09:11.645 --> 09:14.481
<i>I guess some first kills
are harder than others.</i>

09:14.549 --> 09:16.850
Scarab! Proceed
with countermeasures.

09:16.918 --> 09:18.885
<i>There are no known
countermeasures</i>

09:18.914 --> 09:23.042
<i>against this specific combination
of magic and cooperative technology.</i>

09:23.065 --> 09:25.391
This goes well.

09:29.075 --> 09:31.931
<i>This isn't going well.</i>

09:31.999 --> 09:33.867
I'm sorry.

09:33.935 --> 09:37.003
You're sorry?
I'm the one getting dumped.

09:37.071 --> 09:39.386
La'gaan,
try to understand.

09:39.417 --> 09:42.743
All those weeks in captivity
gave me time to think;

09:42.811 --> 09:44.345
To... to gain clarity.

09:44.413 --> 09:46.948
I know now,
I haven't been fair to you.

09:47.016 --> 09:48.817
Shouldn't I get
to decide that?

09:48.884 --> 09:52.152
You don't see it yet.
But the hard truth is,

09:52.175 --> 09:56.692
we only got together because you
made me feel better about myself.

09:56.760 --> 10:00.296
And that's not a relationship.
It's selfishness.

10:00.364 --> 10:02.798
That's just how it started,
Angel fish.

10:02.866 --> 10:05.134
What matters
is what it might become.

10:05.202 --> 10:09.550
Except we'll never be anymore to each
other than what we are right now.

10:09.573 --> 10:11.007
Neptune's beard!

10:11.075 --> 10:15.645
- This is about Connor, isn't it?
- No. It isn't about him.

10:15.713 --> 10:20.071
Or you. This is about me.
I can't give you what you want...

10:20.126 --> 10:22.752
To be something other
than my rebound guy.

10:22.820 --> 10:25.021
And you deserve more than that.

10:25.089 --> 10:28.203
You're right, M'gann. I do.

10:37.369 --> 10:41.783
Enjoy your advantage while you can.
The Reach track my every move.

10:41.822 --> 10:43.608
And when
we're through with you,

10:43.675 --> 10:47.411
there won't be enough left
for a DNA identification.

10:47.479 --> 10:51.301
<i>Nice death threat! Could it get
any more technical and dull?</i>

10:51.345 --> 10:53.586
Why are they not en route
to one of their headquarters?

10:53.638 --> 10:55.519
We need to find out
where they're taking him!

10:55.555 --> 10:57.489
Tell me our destination.

10:57.588 --> 11:00.990
And I'll make
your deaths painless.

11:01.253 --> 11:03.387
<i>Oh, yeah, that scared 'em.</i>

11:17.206 --> 11:19.197
<i>What do they hope
to find here?</i>

11:19.245 --> 11:22.147
<i>Insufficient data.</i>

11:29.937 --> 11:31.451
We've got company!

11:31.477 --> 11:34.922
And I'm otherwise occupied
maintaining this bubble around Blue.

11:34.990 --> 11:38.277
Chillax, Rock'. We're prepped
for Queen Bee's tin soldiers.

11:38.320 --> 11:40.755
[speaking backwards]

11:40.964 --> 11:44.443
- Hey! I was going to do that.
- You can still knock 'em out.

11:44.459 --> 11:46.470
Oh, yeah! Crash!

11:48.805 --> 11:52.396
Hey, hey, hey, let go!
Let go!

11:55.666 --> 11:57.746
Rocket! The force bubble!

11:57.782 --> 12:00.666
Holding!
But I'm a sitting duck here!

12:03.228 --> 12:06.756
You were fools to bring us here.
Queen Bee is our ally,

12:06.823 --> 12:08.848
and her minions
will destroy you.

12:08.880 --> 12:11.442
If only these bubbles
were soundproof.

12:22.340 --> 12:24.107
We don't have time for this.

12:24.175 --> 12:26.176
[speaking backwards]

12:33.069 --> 12:35.418
Girlfriend,
someday you have to tell me

12:35.486 --> 12:37.954
how you figure out
those backwards words so fast.

12:38.022 --> 12:40.490
Maybe backwards
is my native tongue.

12:40.557 --> 12:43.192
- Seriously?
- Come on, let's get to work.

12:49.397 --> 12:50.900
Here.

12:50.967 --> 12:53.269
You, uh, sure you've got
the power for this?

12:53.337 --> 12:55.131
Me? No.

12:55.835 --> 12:58.185
But I'll summon it
from those who do.

13:00.710 --> 13:04.609
[speaking backwards]

13:06.883 --> 13:09.400
<i>Man! I wish I could ask
what's going on.</i>

13:09.439 --> 13:12.043
<i>They doubtless plan
to destroy Blue Beetle.</i>

13:12.099 --> 13:14.767
<i>Ending you and this scarab
in the process.</i>

13:14.835 --> 13:17.737
<i>Hermano, if that's your only
takeaway from our time together,</i>

13:17.805 --> 13:20.073
<i>you haven't learned a thing!</i>

13:22.543 --> 13:26.145
I do not like the implications
of that scarab imagery.

13:26.213 --> 13:31.016
We still know nothing of what
put this scarab off-mode for 4,000 years.

13:31.084 --> 13:33.752
You worry too much.

13:35.916 --> 13:38.865
They all die now!

13:49.569 --> 13:53.172
Guys, this is all on you!
I still got my own Beetle to hold.

13:53.240 --> 13:55.875
<i>And Z's smacked in the middle
of her mystic trance.</i>

13:55.942 --> 13:59.434
Oh, great. Not like our tushes haven't
been kicked by one Beetle already.

13:59.466 --> 14:02.539
But this Beetle comes with his own
personal kryptonite. Go!

14:02.570 --> 14:03.779
Gone!

14:09.857 --> 14:11.573
Ha! Crash.

14:11.628 --> 14:13.827
Those Martians really can't
take the heat.

14:13.894 --> 14:17.697
No, but stay alert.
He has other skills to compensate.

14:46.192 --> 14:48.072
You can thank us later.

14:53.133 --> 14:56.903
Green Beetle is outnumbered. You must
summon Black Beetle immediately.

14:56.971 --> 15:00.774
Black Beetle cannot leave his post
guarding the Warworld's Key Chamber.

15:00.842 --> 15:03.644
Nor do I require his help.

15:09.853 --> 15:12.287
Uh, Z,
we're on the clock, here.

15:13.042 --> 15:18.288
[speaking backwards]

15:30.140 --> 15:32.074
Wicked!

15:32.142 --> 15:34.644
[speaking backwards]

15:55.832 --> 16:00.460
Fools! You will all die!

16:00.485 --> 16:04.136
[speaking backwards]

16:27.173 --> 16:28.507
No!

16:28.574 --> 16:32.844
Beetles Blue and Green are off-mode.
We've lost both!

16:32.912 --> 16:35.190
Why didn't you listen?
I warned you!

16:35.221 --> 16:40.119
Say one... More... Word.

16:50.031 --> 16:53.375
- Ahh.
- Zatanna, you OK? Did it work?

16:55.138 --> 16:57.507
Or are we back to square one?

16:57.574 --> 17:01.078
- Who controls the Beetles?
- Well, let's find out.

17:01.145 --> 17:05.045
[speaking backwards]

17:07.142 --> 17:12.325
<i>It worked. Jaime and B'arzz O'oomm
are back in control of their own bodies.</i>

17:12.352 --> 17:15.298
It's true. I can feel it!

17:15.560 --> 17:17.395
I'm free of the Reach.

17:17.463 --> 17:19.050
For real this time.

17:19.089 --> 17:22.867
You're 100% sure? Because
we've been through this before.

17:22.935 --> 17:25.215
I am certain of it.

17:25.386 --> 17:28.155
Reading no external signals
since Zatanna worked her mojo.

17:28.229 --> 17:29.997
Neither Beetle is in contact
with the Reach.

17:30.269 --> 17:33.994
Hey, hey, hey, <i>hermano!</i>
Congrats!

17:34.031 --> 17:35.575
Thank you.

17:36.225 --> 17:40.569
<i>- Congratulations, Jaime Reyes.</i>
- Oh, right. Like you're happy about this.

17:40.597 --> 17:42.365
I am! I swear!

17:42.432 --> 17:45.794
<i>If this mistrust is your only
takeaway from our time together,</i>

17:45.803 --> 17:47.418
<i>you haven't learned a thing.</i>

17:47.455 --> 17:51.927
<i>This scarab far prefers our partnership
to being slaves to the Reach.</i>

17:51.958 --> 17:56.347
- You know, I believe you.
- Of course you do. Up high.

17:56.681 --> 17:58.849
<i>It has been so long...</i>

17:58.917 --> 18:03.954
<i>I had all but forgotten the sensation
of controlling my own body.</i>

18:04.021 --> 18:06.556
<i>My gratitude knows no bounds.</i>

18:06.624 --> 18:10.227
Uh, that's great, but Queen Bee's goons
are waking up!

18:10.295 --> 18:12.392
Which means it's time to go.

18:21.439 --> 18:24.642
So spill. How did you know
how to cure us?

18:24.669 --> 18:26.803
That temple wasn't even
in the Reach's database.

18:26.832 --> 18:30.201
Bumblebee and I first came across it
months ago, on another mission.

18:30.237 --> 18:32.915
<i>I couldn't help noticing
the Blue Scarab imagery,</i>

18:32.950 --> 18:36.085
<i>and recorded a holographic file
of the symbols in hieroglyphics.</i>

18:36.153 --> 18:39.836
<i>Dr. Fate was able to translate the glyphs,
which revealed a mystic ceremony</i>

18:39.859 --> 18:43.059
<i>the ancients had used to cleanse
the scarab of Reach control.</i>

18:43.127 --> 18:45.880
That's why my scarab
was off-mode when I found it.

18:45.922 --> 18:49.625
<i>I had been cleansed upon landing
on Earth 4,000 years ago.</i>

18:49.669 --> 18:52.238
Because the ritual
used magic of human origin,

18:52.310 --> 18:55.105
Fate, a lord of order,
could not perform it.

18:55.173 --> 18:56.907
So he prepped me instead.

18:56.975 --> 18:59.543
Meanwhile, Batgirl
and I got with the hacking.

18:59.611 --> 19:03.286
<i>Starting with the computer files of the
previous Blue Beetle, the late Ted Kord.</i>

19:03.312 --> 19:06.450
<i>Ted's files revealed that
an archaeologist named Dan Garrett</i>

19:06.518 --> 19:09.635
<i>first discovered both the temple
and the scarab in 1939.</i>

19:09.658 --> 19:11.733
<i>It fused with him
the way it fused with you,</i>

19:11.801 --> 19:14.002
<i>but Dan assumed it was some kind
of mystic artifact,</i>

19:14.070 --> 19:17.703
<i>and he used it to become the first
Blue Beetle of modern times.</i>

19:17.728 --> 19:22.265
When Dan passed away, he left
the scarab to his protege, Ted Kord.

19:22.314 --> 19:25.848
But Kord quickly realized
the scarab was alien technology.

19:25.916 --> 19:29.274
Since he wasn't about to let
an alien device fuse to his spine,

19:29.321 --> 19:31.000
he locked the scarab away.

19:31.032 --> 19:33.715
But Garrett still inspired Ted
to become the second Blue Beetle,

19:33.757 --> 19:35.625
even with no superpowers.

19:35.692 --> 19:37.751
Ah, I hear those are optional.

19:37.846 --> 19:41.782
<i>Anyway, Ted suspected
the Light wanted the scarab back in play.</i>

19:41.876 --> 19:45.945
<i>He tried to stop them from stealing it,
and paid the ultimate price.</i>

19:45.973 --> 19:48.088
<i>That's where you came in.</i>

19:49.392 --> 19:52.319
Guess I wasn't exactly what
the Light or Reach had in mind.

19:52.387 --> 19:54.154
But why keep all this from me?

19:54.222 --> 19:56.556
Because it took months
for me to learn the ritual.

19:56.624 --> 19:59.993
And not to mention, configure
the ancient Bialyian incantations

20:00.030 --> 20:01.564
to work in concert
with my magic.

20:01.663 --> 20:03.464
And you couldn't risk
letting the Reach know

20:03.465 --> 20:05.733
the temple existed
until you were ready.

20:05.801 --> 20:08.869
You managed to keep
your mouth shut? You?

20:08.937 --> 20:13.406
Hey, making sure you stayed a hero was
the main reason I came back to the past.

20:13.474 --> 20:17.436
So I was motivated to take my mouth
off-mode. Don't you get used to it, now.

20:20.292 --> 20:23.571
Great news, Team.
Nightwing, out.

20:23.629 --> 20:25.586
What's great news?

20:25.653 --> 20:28.989
The Team freed Blue Beetle
and Green Beetle from Reach control.

20:29.057 --> 20:32.802
Terrific. You need me,
I'm watching TV.

20:35.530 --> 20:38.299
Um, is Connor around?

20:38.367 --> 20:42.103
He said something about
going out with Wendy Harris.

20:42.170 --> 20:45.038
Oh. Right...

20:54.116 --> 20:57.934
I realize my order to throw
the fight against the children

20:57.949 --> 21:01.981
was disappointing,
and you have my sympathies.

21:01.994 --> 21:04.521
But it was a necessary evil.

21:05.800 --> 21:10.398
Now the Light's plans for
the Reach, the League and the Team

21:10.466 --> 21:14.369
may proceed on schedule.
