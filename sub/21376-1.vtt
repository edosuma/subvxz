00:13.430 --> 00:14.139
Let's go.

00:14.222 --> 00:18.226
[cheers and applause]

00:18.309 --> 00:21.938
[hip-hop music]

00:22.021 --> 00:23.898
- What's up, ya'll?
Make some noise for yourselves.

00:23.982 --> 00:26.151
Make some
noise for yourselves.

00:26.234 --> 00:28.611
Make some noise for my DJ, Norm
"Thump" Nixon.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.238
- Hey, what up? What up?
What up? What up? What up?

00:30.321 --> 00:33.408
- In the building,
in the building.

00:33.491 --> 00:35.243
What's up, ya'll?
I'm hyped.

00:35.326 --> 00:38.788
This is the very first episode
of "Hood Adjacent."

00:38.872 --> 00:39.956
[cheers and applause]

00:40.039 --> 00:44.127
I'm your host, James Davis.

00:44.210 --> 00:45.628
Well, I'm gonna keep it 100.
I'm from South Central.

00:45.712 --> 00:48.131
But not
that South Central.

00:48.214 --> 00:50.049
I'm not
from that "Menace II Society,"

00:50.133 --> 00:51.009
"Boyz N the Hood" part of town.

00:51.092 --> 00:53.970
"Hunger Games," that's not my
district.

00:54.053 --> 00:56.973
That's district 12;
I grew up district 13.

00:57.056 --> 00:59.350
I grew up in the neutral zone.
When the riots happened,

00:59.434 --> 01:02.896
I could smell it, but I couldn't
see it.

01:02.979 --> 01:03.938
[laughter]

01:04.022 --> 01:05.440
"Who BBQing, Mama?"

01:05.522 --> 01:07.984
"Everybody, baby.
Now go inside.

01:08.067 --> 01:11.070
I'm 'bout to go shopping."

01:11.154 --> 01:14.240
But that's me.
I'm not hood.

01:14.324 --> 01:18.036
I'm hood adjacent.

01:18.119 --> 01:20.789
Now tonight we're going to
take a deep dive into the hood,

01:20.872 --> 01:24.918
because the hood is at the
epicenter of American culture.

01:25.001 --> 01:27.921
Right now the top 5 artists on
the Billboard 100 are Drake,

01:28.004 --> 01:31.508
Kendrick Lamar, Bryson Tiller,

01:31.591 --> 01:33.802
Lil Yachty, and The Beatles.

01:33.885 --> 01:36.012
And only one of them isn't from
the hood.

01:36.095 --> 01:37.931
Sorry, Drake, Liverpool is just
Compton in England.

01:38.014 --> 01:40.266
[laughter]

01:40.350 --> 01:42.227
{\an1}And then you got Kim Kardashian
out here

01:42.310 --> 01:44.604
popularizing box braids.

01:44.687 --> 01:47.190
It's cornrows, people,
and she didn't start it.

01:47.273 --> 01:49.025
Queen Latifah did in "Set It
Off."

01:49.108 --> 01:50.193
Ain't I right?

01:50.276 --> 01:52.320
- Preach.

01:52.403 --> 01:54.823
- The hood is so hot right now,
if you Google the word "twerk"

01:54.906 --> 01:57.283
on YouTube, you're gonna find
millions of videos

01:57.367 --> 01:59.869
of white girls
doing it incorrectly.

01:59.953 --> 02:02.497
And it's really simple.

02:02.580 --> 02:04.999
Step one: have an ass.

02:05.083 --> 02:07.877
[laughter and applause]

02:07.961 --> 02:10.045
Step two: repeat step one.

02:10.128 --> 02:13.007
That's it.
It's really, really easy.

02:13.091 --> 02:17.053
On Hollywood Boulevard, there
are actually people

02:17.137 --> 02:19.138
paying money--this is a real
thing--

02:19.222 --> 02:22.475
to go on a tour of the hood.

02:22.559 --> 02:23.852
That's crazy.

02:23.935 --> 02:25.728
The hood is the new Disneyland.

02:25.812 --> 02:27.397
Except the lines are shorter,
and you might get shot.

02:27.480 --> 02:29.065
[laughter]

02:29.149 --> 02:30.275
But listen, the hood is not an
amusement park,

02:30.358 --> 02:34.487
and you can't just show up
there all willy-nilly.

02:34.571 --> 02:38.241
So I took my adjacent ass into
the hood

02:38.324 --> 02:40.451
to get my hood pass.

02:40.535 --> 02:42.871
[cheers and applause]

02:42.954 --> 02:46.082
A hood pass is permission to
move in and around the hood.

02:46.165 --> 02:50.503
I feel like I've sort of got one
but not a full one.

02:50.587 --> 02:53.923
So today is all about getting a
full hood pass.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.718
{\an8}So I bring my
boy B.Dot from North Carolina,

02:56.801 --> 02:58.094
{\an8}and then I get my boy Martini,
pretty boy model from Jersey.

02:58.177 --> 03:02.223
{\an8}<i>And we hit up one of my</i>
<i>most hoodest friends: Stevie J.</i>

03:02.307 --> 03:04.058
{\an1}- Hey, why you [BLEEP]
all huddled up on the couch

03:04.142 --> 03:05.852
touching thighs and shit?

03:05.935 --> 03:06.603
{\an1}- I mean, I definitely just
didn't know what the

03:06.686 --> 03:09.105
seating arrangement was.

03:09.188 --> 03:10.231
{\an1}I didn't know if--I didn't know
if another homey

03:10.315 --> 03:11.941
was in the bathroom
or was going to come out

03:12.025 --> 03:13.151
or anything like that.

03:13.234 --> 03:14.777
But listen, but listen.

03:14.861 --> 03:17.113
{\an3}Break down to them
what a hood pass is.

03:17.196 --> 03:18.948
{\an1}- Hood pass is like this,
my [BLEEP].

03:19.032 --> 03:21.284
I'm vouching for you [BLEEP].
You feel me?

03:21.367 --> 03:24.579
{\an1}Anything you do
is a representation of me.

03:24.662 --> 03:25.163
Don't do no weird shit.

03:25.246 --> 03:27.624
Don't do no buster shit.

03:27.707 --> 03:29.125
{\an7}Don't do no hook-ass shit,
and you'll be straight.

03:29.208 --> 03:31.294
{\an3}- How much is an eighth
around here?

03:31.377 --> 03:32.921
{\an1}- Man.

03:33.004 --> 03:34.172
{\an1}- You gon' get your
ass whupped for that.

03:34.255 --> 03:35.882
{\an1}- That's--that's
real specific.

03:35.965 --> 03:37.383
- Hey, tell me your name again?
- B.Dot.

03:37.467 --> 03:38.343
{\an1}- B.Dot? Hey, you got
to change that fast, bro.

03:38.426 --> 03:40.887
The B.Dot shit, that
shit get you shot, bro.

03:40.970 --> 03:42.180
- Yeah, that's true.
- Yeah, what's your name?

03:42.263 --> 03:44.140
{\an1}- Yeah, what is--what's your
government?

03:44.223 --> 03:45.391
- It's Brian. Brian is my--yeah.
Should I just go with Brian?

03:45.475 --> 03:46.476
- Your name is Brian, first off.

03:46.559 --> 03:48.478
{\an1}- What about Martini though?
That's cool, right?

03:48.561 --> 03:49.354
- Your name Martini, bro?
- Yeah.

03:49.437 --> 03:51.064
- So you like getting
drunk and shit?

03:51.147 --> 03:53.733
- I smoke. I'm not a drinker.

03:53.816 --> 03:55.485
- Why the [BLEEP]
your name Martini?

03:55.568 --> 03:57.570
- So your new name is Zigzag.
- Zigzag. I like Zigzag.

03:57.654 --> 04:01.407
- Take that weak-ass bandana
off your mother[BLEEP] hat.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.660
- He did say something.
He did say something.

04:03.743 --> 04:05.119
- What's your name?
What is your name?

04:05.203 --> 04:07.455
- Zigzag.
- No. No. No. What is your name?

04:07.538 --> 04:08.831
- Oh. My name is Sean.
- [BLEEP].

04:08.915 --> 04:10.416
{\an3}- Ohh.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.168
{\an1}- Zigzag. You gotta say
Zigzag correctly.

04:12.251 --> 04:14.671
You gotta be able to answer
under pressure and duress.

04:14.754 --> 04:15.922
- Okay, all right.

04:16.005 --> 04:17.507
- My name is Baseball.

04:17.589 --> 04:19.007
Any time you say it,
it's like a code word.

04:19.091 --> 04:21.511
Everything
just kind of settles.

04:21.594 --> 04:25.014
Like, "Oh, he know the homey;
he cool."

04:25.098 --> 04:26.182
But if you in the area
and you say the nickname

04:26.265 --> 04:29.227
and that nickname doesn't
register,

04:29.310 --> 04:31.020
it could agitate some things.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.022
- What if somebody else
has your nickname?

04:33.106 --> 04:34.399
- Nobody else my nickname.

04:34.482 --> 04:35.692
- In all of the hoods
of Los Angeles--

04:35.775 --> 04:38.236
- Nobody else has my nickname.

04:38.319 --> 04:40.780
- So in a way, the nickname is
the pass.

04:40.863 --> 04:43.032
{\an3}Guys, I feel like, you know, we
done put in our time,

04:43.116 --> 04:46.536
we've heard y'all out, we've
digested it mentally.

04:46.619 --> 04:49.163
We deserve our hood passes.

04:50.289 --> 04:52.834
{\an3}Y'all agree? That's a yes?
Perfect.

04:52.917 --> 04:55.294

06:37.355 --> 06:39.899

just become a black male

06:39.982 --> 06:41.526
talking to a black male.

06:41.609 --> 06:43.653
"Hey bro, [BLEEP] Donald
Trump. I know. I know."

06:43.736 --> 06:45.613
You know, we just had to make a
common ground happen real fast,

'cause I knew that if I didn't
say the right things,

06:49.575 --> 06:51.828
I might have to catch his fade,
and for those who don't know,

06:51.911 --> 06:53.913
that means get
knocked the [BLEEP] out.

{\an1}- He gave us a hood pass
earlier.

07:02.421 --> 07:05.842
{\an3}And so part of his hood
pass tour is coming here.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.343
What we was doing comedically.
- Who is he?

07:07.426 --> 07:08.928
- That brother looked mad.

07:09.011 --> 07:10.513
But then Stevie J
had all the answers,

07:10.596 --> 07:12.181
all the homeboys to reference,
all the streets.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.976

For a couple hours I thought I
was hood.

07:39.375 --> 07:41.544

you know what,
James?

07:43.296 --> 07:44.714
You adjacent
than a mother[BLEEP].

08:02.315 --> 08:04.233
And my director, he was like,
"We need more B-roll."

08:04.317 --> 08:06.736
I was like, "Nah, dawg.
we need to roll, B."

08:06.819 --> 08:08.988
Hey, we'll be back y'all.
Turn up.

08:09.071 --> 08:11.908
[cheers and applause]

08:13.826 --> 08:14.577
- Welcome back y'all,
welcome back.

08:14.660 --> 08:17.955
Now, you can't talk about the
hood

08:18.039 --> 08:19.582
without talking about the
trap.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.083
Trap music, that's what's
hot.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.335
That's what's playin' in
the club.

08:22.418 --> 08:24.295
Future's rappin'
about being a super trapper.

08:24.378 --> 08:27.048
Fetty Wap hit us up with the
"Trap Queen."

08:27.131 --> 08:28.716
Everyone's talkin'
about the trap house.

08:28.799 --> 08:29.926
Now, for
those of that don't know,

08:30.009 --> 08:32.135
the trap house, that's where you
make and push your product.

08:32.220 --> 08:34.179
Whatever you can't get on
Amazon

08:34.263 --> 08:38.226
is made or sold at the
trap house.

08:38.308 --> 08:40.602
And they can deliver it way
faster than Prime.

08:40.686 --> 08:41.312
Now, I got some homies.

08:41.395 --> 08:44.106
Their names are Spank and News.

08:44.190 --> 08:47.276
They turned their trap house
into a legit business

08:47.360 --> 08:48.945
that they call the Trap Kitchen.

08:49.028 --> 08:52.406
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:52.490 --> 08:54.116
It's a catering company.

08:54.200 --> 08:57.286
It's lit.
Let's see what they up to.

08:57.370 --> 08:58.788
{\an8}<i>- ♪ Aw, yeah ♪</i>

{\an8}<i>Meet Spank and News,</i>

{\an8}That's not who you are now,

{\an9}but let's just get
it out the way so they know.

09:16.347 --> 09:19.308
- Still gang members.
- Okay. [laughs]

09:19.392 --> 09:21.894
{\an1}- We just don't indulge--engage
in the street life, okay?

09:21.978 --> 09:24.230
We turned it around.

09:24.313 --> 09:25.773
- Yeah, but, Spank, tell 'em
about

09:25.856 --> 09:26.524
your other affiliation,
bro.

09:26.607 --> 09:28.192
{\an1}- Are you talking about
a Troop 848?

09:28.276 --> 09:32.238
- Troop 848, fall in.

09:32.321 --> 09:33.656
<i>- Man, I was about seven years</i>
<i>old when I met James.</i>

09:33.739 --> 09:36.158
- Spank realized
earlier than I did

09:36.242 --> 09:37.910
that this whole Boy Scout thing

09:37.994 --> 09:40.454
{\an3}ain't gonna get us no bitches,
so...

09:40.538 --> 09:42.164
[laughter]

09:42.248 --> 09:44.583
What separates a regular kitchen
from a trap kitchen?

09:44.667 --> 09:46.586
- Well, this is underground,
social media restaurant.

09:46.669 --> 09:49.672
<i>We're located right in the</i>
<i>center of the hood.</i>

09:49.755 --> 09:51.841
<i>You can't even get the address</i>
<i>unless you're ordering for sure.</i>

09:51.924 --> 09:54.093
- Mmm.

09:54.176 --> 09:57.013
Yep, when a black person

09:57.096 --> 09:59.432
start pointing with the
utensil...

09:59.515 --> 10:00.766
- It's good.

10:00.850 --> 10:01.726
{\an1}- And you've gotta shake your
head too.

10:01.809 --> 10:02.268
- I need ya'll
to do something for me, a favor.

10:02.351 --> 10:04.687
- What do you want, man?

10:04.770 --> 10:05.187
- I'm afraid of chitlins.

10:05.271 --> 10:09.191
{\an8}<i>[audience groans]</i>

10:09.275 --> 10:10.860
No food has come out that was
worse than chitlins,

10:10.943 --> 10:14.530
but I'm not a man who likes to
have fear in his heart.

10:14.613 --> 10:16.282
{\an1}- Yeah.

10:16.365 --> 10:17.783
- So is there any way we can
make chitlins today?

10:17.867 --> 10:19.535
This is just--
- This is an 848 favor.

10:19.618 --> 10:23.205
<i>[hip-hop music]</i>

10:23.289 --> 10:25.333
<i>- I knew chitlins would be</i>
<i>disgusting.</i>

10:25.416 --> 10:26.792
<i>I mean, the kind of smell that</i>
<i>eats through your clothes.</i>

10:26.876 --> 10:27.668
<i>So your boy came prepared.</i>

10:27.752 --> 10:31.839
We had it so bad in the
slavery times

10:31.922 --> 10:33.966
that the masters
would eat all the good food

10:34.050 --> 10:36.719
<i>and then they would give us</i>
<i>intestines,</i>

10:36.802 --> 10:38.679
'cause, you know, we
were slaves.

10:38.763 --> 10:39.597
Eww.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.474
Oh, we gonna
have to quarantine this place.

10:41.557 --> 10:45.561
So when you pulling the
chitlins apart,

10:45.644 --> 10:49.065
how do you
still love yourself afterwards?

10:49.148 --> 10:51.317
You don't know this right now,
but it smells like

10:51.400 --> 10:54.570
stripper ass
right when she clock out.

10:54.653 --> 10:55.780
All right, moment of truth.

10:55.863 --> 10:57.573
I got my man Martin...

<i>A former Boy Scout from Troop</i>

Let's eat some chitlins.

11:08.793 --> 11:10.252
{\an1}Uncle Greg, you wanna dish us
out?

11:10.336 --> 11:10.920
- Sure.

11:11.003 --> 11:13.089
- Oh, goodness.

11:13.172 --> 11:15.049
Why are you excited?

11:15.132 --> 11:17.927
- It just turns me on
to see the guts.

11:18.010 --> 11:20.763
- Your excitement for chitlins

11:20.846 --> 11:21.847
{\an1}makes me question Grandma and
Grandpa.

11:21.931 --> 11:25.643
- Just imagine the shit
that went through 'em.

11:25.726 --> 11:27.895
- Why? Why would I imagine that?

11:27.978 --> 11:28.604
{\an3}- Put some more on mine.
This is--this is--

11:28.687 --> 11:30.231
- [BLEEP] it.
- Are you sure?

11:30.314 --> 11:32.358
{\an3}- Yeah, [BLEEP] it.
I'm goin in.

{\an3}- Young man, you have
to take this.

11:39.115 --> 11:40.157
{\an1}- That's gonna spice it up?
Make it...

11:40.241 --> 11:43.285
- Oh, man, it's gonna make it
taste a whole lot better.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.954
{\an1}- Oh, so it's gonna turn it from
awful

11:45.037 --> 11:45.746
to just a little bit nasty?

11:45.830 --> 11:48.416
- It's not awful.
See, watch this.

11:52.253 --> 11:53.003
- What are you doing over there?

11:53.087 --> 11:55.631
- Not eating chitlins
right now.

11:55.714 --> 11:57.299
Okay, everybody on three.

11:57.383 --> 11:58.259
We gotta toast it, too.
Toast your chitlins.

Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.

12:07.017 --> 12:10.479

12:10.563 --> 12:12.481

12:12.565 --> 12:15.818
No. No. No. No.

12:15.901 --> 12:18.529

No, Uncle, no.

12:22.908 --> 12:25.828
Stop.
The point needs to be made.

12:25.911 --> 12:27.037
We've come to a decision
as a table

12:27.121 --> 12:29.999
that chitlins is over.
They're retired.

12:30.082 --> 12:33.085
Rest in peace, chitlins.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.795
It had a good run.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.672
I think slavery until now.

12:36.755 --> 12:38.883
So we'd like to say good-bye
to it the way we do in the hood,

12:38.966 --> 12:40.676
so forever in our hearts.

12:40.759 --> 12:45.473

know Beyoncé last year

13:13.501 --> 13:13.918
released "Lemonade."

13:14.001 --> 13:17.630
It was dope, right?

13:17.713 --> 13:20.841
"Lemonade" inspired empowerment
among black women.

13:20.925 --> 13:25.054
But it also inspired a lot of
covers like this.

13:35.606 --> 13:37.107
white girls and ukuleles.

13:37.191 --> 13:41.904
For some people, Beyoncé
is their Martin Luther Queen.

13:41.987 --> 13:46.283
So what you not about to do
is make a cover of her

13:46.367 --> 13:48.327
"I Have a Dream" speech.

13:48.410 --> 13:50.871
Side note: we gotta do something
about how easy it is for these

13:50.955 --> 13:52.081

on ukuleles.

13:52.164 --> 13:54.583

You love Beyoncé.

13:55.793 --> 13:56.418

13:56.502 --> 13:58.796
Nothing is wrong with that.

13:58.879 --> 14:00.673
But you can't subvert the
meaning of the message.

14:00.756 --> 14:02.424
If you do, the hood is gonna
clap back

14:02.508 --> 14:06.136
giving you a taste

14:39.670 --> 14:42.464
But I feel like
we can go whiter.

14:42.548 --> 14:46.510
The whitest song of all time

15:05.321 --> 15:08.073
Now, you may know the lyrics to
the "National Anthem,"

15:08.157 --> 15:11.160
but chances are you don't that
Francis Scott Key

15:11.243 --> 15:15.497

verse that celebrated the death

15:15.581 --> 15:18.667

15:18.751 --> 15:21.670

blacks were...

15:23.464 --> 15:26.133

Key died, that was the only time

something.

I'm just kidding.

17:37.514 --> 17:39.433
We got more show.

17:39.516 --> 17:41.977
Now, if we've learned anything
from Bill Maher this month,

17:42.060 --> 17:45.522
it's that a slipup on national
TV can ruin your life.

17:45.606 --> 17:47.900
So this is "Ruin Your Life."

17:47.983 --> 17:49.693
Simple game.
- All right, okay.

17:49.777 --> 17:51.737
{\an8}- Four questions.
- Okay.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.697
{\an9}- All you gotta do is answer
the questions,

17:53.781 --> 17:56.950
{\an9}and you get the--
the prize.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.952
{\an8}- All right. Okay, okay.
What's the prize?

17:59.036 --> 18:02.998
{\an9}- First question: what's
your name?

18:03.081 --> 18:03.332
{\an8}- Darragh

18:03.415 --> 18:04.708
{\an7}- Cillian.

18:04.792 --> 18:06.835
{\an8}- What's your name?
- Sammy.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.420
{\an8}- How old are you?
- 23.

18:08.504 --> 18:11.965
{\an8}- 21.
- 21.

18:12.049 --> 18:12.508
{\an8}- 32
- How old are you?

18:12.591 --> 18:15.844
{\an8}- 29.
- 32.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.387
{\an8}- It don't matter.
- Right.

18:17.471 --> 18:18.347
{\an8}- Where you work at?

18:18.430 --> 18:19.056
{\an8}- I'm in college.

18:19.139 --> 18:20.557
{\an8}- What do you do for a living?

18:20.641 --> 18:21.683
{\an8}- Uh, nothing.

18:21.767 --> 18:24.561
{\an8}- Last question...

18:24.645 --> 18:26.522
{\an8}- All right.

18:26.605 --> 18:28.857
{\an8}- Will you say the N-word?

18:28.941 --> 18:30.776
{\an8}- Get the [BLEEP] outta here.

18:30.859 --> 18:36.406
{\an9}- For a bead, will you
say the N-word?

18:36.490 --> 18:38.575
{\an8}- [BLEEP].

18:38.659 --> 18:41.954
{\an8}[buzzer buzzes]

18:44.706 --> 18:46.083
{\an8}- That happened.

18:46.959 --> 18:51.713
{\an8}You've been the first contestant
on "Ruin Your Life."

18:51.797 --> 18:52.214
{\an8}She said it, not me.

18:52.297 --> 18:53.590
{\an8}For two beads each...

18:53.674 --> 18:55.926
{\an8}- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:56.009 --> 18:58.929
{\an9}- Will you two look at the
camera

18:59.012 --> 19:00.430
{\an8}and say the N-word?

19:01.139 --> 19:04.726
{\an8}- The N-word?
- The N-word.

19:04.810 --> 19:07.271
{\an7}- No.
No, that's not right.

19:07.354 --> 19:08.146
{\an9}- You said, "No, that's not
right."

19:08.230 --> 19:09.022
{\an8}What about you?
- Yeah, no, I don't--no,

19:09.106 --> 19:10.941
{\an8}it's not appropriate.
- That's correct.

19:11.024 --> 19:12.401
{\an8}- The N word was "no."
- Okay. Ahh.

19:12.484 --> 19:16.780
{\an9}- Ahh!

19:16.864 --> 19:19.283
{\an9}Why can't we all be like
Ireland?

19:19.366 --> 19:22.035
{\an8}Damn it. Why can't we
all be like Ireland?

19:22.119 --> 19:26.248
{\an8}It's cracked, the sesh is lit,
and nobody's sayin' "Nigga".

19:26.331 --> 19:27.708
{\an8}[buzzer buzzes]

19:27.791 --> 19:28.876
- 'Cause it's not right.

19:28.959 --> 19:31.920
- "It's not right."

19:32.004 --> 19:34.965
You heard Cillian.

19:35.048 --> 19:36.550
Come on, now,
you know if you're allowed

19:36.633 --> 19:38.969
to say it or not.

19:39.052 --> 19:39.636
The permission
slip is in your soul.

19:39.720 --> 19:40.596
And your pigmentation.

19:46.768 --> 19:48.562
- Hey. Oh, y'all back
for some more?

19:48.645 --> 19:51.106
Okay. Well, you know,
the "Hood Adjacent" experience

19:51.189 --> 19:52.858
doesn't end when the show
is over.

19:52.941 --> 19:54.568
This is a lifestyle.

19:54.651 --> 19:56.904
Either you in or you out,
homey.

19:56.987 --> 19:58.614
You bout about this hood
adjacent lifestyle ma'am?

19:58.697 --> 19:59.990
Are you? For real?

20:00.073 --> 20:01.617
Throw up your
hood adjacent right now.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.285
Throw it up. Make it up.
Just do it.

[cheers and applause]

20:13.879 --> 20:15.923
Now you all saw my trap cover
of the "National Anthem."

20:16.006 --> 20:20.010
I killed it.
No discussion necessary.

20:20.093 --> 20:23.931
But I want to see
you guys' trap covers.

20:24.014 --> 20:25.140
Yes, you guys'.

20:25.223 --> 20:28.977
I want you guys to make
a trap cover

20:29.061 --> 20:31.730
of your favorite
white projects.

20:31.813 --> 20:34.441
{\an1}Maybe you go to
some sound bite of Ivanka Trump

20:34.524 --> 20:35.901
talkin' about how great
her dad is.

20:35.984 --> 20:38.153
Or a monologue from
"Downton Abbey."

20:38.236 --> 20:40.447
I don't know.
Trap that shit up.

20:40.530 --> 20:44.493
Tweet me your best trap covers,
@hoodadjacent #dodopeshit.
