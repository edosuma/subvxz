anything in my entire life.

-Okay.

Maybe we're going a little overboard.

as much as us.

14:01.882 --> 14:03.342
It's called winning, honey.

It occurs to me...

14:31.245 --> 14:34.999
we don't need to have the correct answer.
We just need to have the same answer.

14:37.126 --> 14:41.547
Why don't we give ourselves a leg up
and start each answer with the letter D?

14:44.300 --> 14:45.384
Isn't that cheating?

14:45.801 --> 14:46.719
That's not cheating.

14:47.428 --> 14:51.181
That's like when I used to slash the tires
of my opponents before each race.

15:32.181 --> 15:33.098
Sure, what's up?

15:33.515 --> 15:36.894
What's up is I no longer want Kimberlina
to feel like William goat.

15:38.979 --> 15:42.149
She deserves to be treated
like an airplane.

15:44.652 --> 15:46.111
Well, great. Good talk.

15:49.073 --> 15:51.283
I need you to tank the competition.

15:51.367 --> 15:52.409
What?

15:52.826 --> 15:54.620
Give Kimberlina a chance.

15:55.829 --> 15:58.791
I can't do that.
You know how much DJ loves to win

15:58.916 --> 16:01.502

when she loses.

16:02.336 --> 16:05.089
I mean, in theory.
I've never actually seen it.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.091
Exactly.

16:07.174 --> 16:10.219
You and DJ won the last competition.
You will win the next competition.

16:10.844 --> 16:16.934
Tonight must belong to my Kimberlina,
and only you can make that happen.

Please, I am begging you.

You're really being sincere?
