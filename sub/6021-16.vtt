WEBVTT

00:04.270 --> 00:07.205
All right, be careful with the car, babe.
And don't move the seat.

00:11.378 --> 00:12.436
-Two and 10, babe.
-Okay.

00:12.612 --> 00:15.308
-Don't peel out.
-I won't.

00:20.053 --> 00:24.217
<i>Jesus is one, Jesus is all</i>

00:24.391 --> 00:28.919
<i>Jesus, pick me up when I fall</i>

00:29.095 --> 00:32.360
<i>And he said unto Abraham--</i>

00:32.531 --> 00:35.092
<i>Amen, amen</i>

00:35.268 --> 00:36.326
<i>So we pray--</i>

00:36.503 --> 00:37.492
<i>Faith--</i>

00:37.670 --> 00:39.535
<i>Jesus--</i>

00:41.074 --> 00:43.099
Jesus?

00:47.947 --> 00:51.280
According to our latest
quarterly thing...

00:52.452 --> 00:56.912
...Kruger Industrial Smoothing
is heading into the red.

00:57.090 --> 01:01.049
Or the black.
Or whatever the bad one is.

01:01.394 --> 01:03.259
Any thoughts?

01:04.831 --> 01:09.461
Well, l--
I know, when I'm a little strapped...

01:09.636 --> 01:15.973
...I sometimes drop off my rent check
having "forgotten" to sign it.

01:16.142 --> 01:17.734
That could buy us some time.

01:18.611 --> 01:21.478
Works for me.
Good thinking, George.

01:21.648 --> 01:24.310
-Good idea.
-All right, George. Way to go, man.

01:24.517 --> 01:27.975
Or we don't even send the check...

01:28.154 --> 01:31.521
...and then when they call,
we pretend we're the cleaning service.

01:32.025 --> 01:36.462
"Hello? I'm sorry, no here Kruger."

01:37.097 --> 01:38.086
Are you done?

01:39.899 --> 01:43.665
Silly voices.
Come on, people, let's get real.

01:43.837 --> 01:47.238
-Good one.
-That was bad.

01:50.910 --> 01:52.901
I had them, Jerry. They loved me.

01:53.079 --> 01:55.513
-And then?
-I lost them.

01:56.116 --> 01:58.914
I can usually come up with
one good comment during a meeting...

01:59.085 --> 02:02.851
...but by the end, it's buried
under a pile of gaffes and bad puns.

02:03.623 --> 02:04.612
Showmanship, George.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.760
When you hit that high note,
you say good night and walk off.

02:07.927 --> 02:11.363
-I can't just leave.
-That's the way they do it in Vegas.

02:11.531 --> 02:14.762
-You never played Vegas.
-I hear things.

02:18.037 --> 02:19.834
Here's one.

02:20.006 --> 02:21.303
I borrowed Puddy's car...

02:21.474 --> 02:27.435
...and all the presets on his radio
were Christian rock stations.

02:28.715 --> 02:30.876
I like Christian rock.

02:31.050 --> 02:32.881
It's very positive.

02:33.052 --> 02:37.216
It's not like those real musicians
who think they're so cool and hip.

02:38.691 --> 02:41.717
So you think that Puddy actually
believes in something?

02:41.895 --> 02:44.864
Well, it's a used car. He probably
never changed the presets.

02:45.031 --> 02:46.862
Yes. He is lazy.

02:47.033 --> 02:48.898
He doesn't know
how to program the buttons.

02:49.068 --> 02:51.798
Yes. He is dumb.

02:52.405 --> 02:55.067
So you prefer dumb and lazy
to religious?

02:55.241 --> 02:57.937
Dumb and lazy I understand.

02:58.845 --> 03:00.642
I'll tell you how you could check.

03:00.813 --> 03:03.304
Reprogram all the buttons,
see if he changes them back.

03:03.483 --> 03:06.247
You know, the old switcheroo.

03:06.419 --> 03:09.081
No, no, the old switcheroo
is you poison your drink...

03:09.255 --> 03:11.849
...and then you switch it
with the other person's.

03:12.025 --> 03:15.051
No, it's doing the same thing
to someone that they did to you.

03:15.228 --> 03:19.255
Elaine's gonna do the same thing to
Puddy's radio that the radio did to her.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.760
-Well, that's the gist of it.
-Quiet!

03:23.903 --> 03:27.930
-So where is this Sophie?
-She's picking me up in a few minutes.

03:28.107 --> 03:31.770
-How long have you been together?
-I don't know. Since the last one.

03:33.112 --> 03:34.909
Oh, here she is.
You wanna meet her?

03:38.151 --> 03:41.120
By the way, how did Puddy
get back in the picture?

03:41.287 --> 03:44.723
I-- I needed to move a bureau.

03:49.862 --> 03:51.022
Jerry, you got any pepper?

03:51.197 --> 03:52.459
-Hey, Jerry.
-Hey, Mickey.

03:52.632 --> 03:54.293
-Check the peppershaker.
-Yeah.

03:55.201 --> 03:56.190
Mickey.

04:03.009 --> 04:06.137
See? It should sound like that.
Something like that.

04:08.881 --> 04:11.406
No, a little wetter.
See, I didn't believe it.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.051
What's with the fake sneezing?

04:13.219 --> 04:15.016
We're going down
to Mount Sinai Hospital.

04:15.188 --> 04:18.452
See, they hire actors to help
the students practice diagnosing.

04:18.625 --> 04:21.116
They assign you a disease
and you act out the symptoms.

04:21.293 --> 04:24.092
-It's an easy gig.
-Yeah.

04:25.164 --> 04:28.327
-Do medical schools actually do this?
-Well, the better ones.

04:30.003 --> 04:32.233
All right,
let's practice retching, huh?

04:32.405 --> 04:33.736
Ready?

04:36.142 --> 04:37.973
I think the phone is ringing.

04:38.411 --> 04:40.811
Would you hold it a second?

04:42.181 --> 04:44.479
Thank you. Will you get out of here
with that stuff?

04:44.651 --> 04:47.381
Mickey, D.T.'s, huh?

04:49.188 --> 04:51.520
-Hello?
-Hey, it's me.

04:51.691 --> 04:54.251
-Elaine?
-No. It's me.

04:54.427 --> 04:56.361
George?

04:58.131 --> 04:59.962
Jerry, it's Sophie.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.431
I can't believe
you don't recognize my voice.

05:02.602 --> 05:04.968
I knew it was you. I was joking.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.197
I'm a comedian.

05:08.841 --> 05:10.274
Hey, you got any ipecac?

05:10.777 --> 05:13.905
Ipecac? Kramer, I really think
you guys are going too far with this.

05:14.080 --> 05:18.016
-No. Mickey, he swallowed 12 aspirin.
-Did he overdose?

05:18.184 --> 05:20.550
No, it's just too much.

05:22.388 --> 05:23.855
And it gets worse.

05:24.023 --> 05:26.821
The team working on the statue
in Lafayette Square...

05:26.993 --> 05:28.961
...kind of over-smoothed it.

05:29.128 --> 05:33.087
They ground the head down
to about the size of a softball.

05:33.266 --> 05:34.563
And that spells trouble.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.367
Why don't we smooth the head
down to nothing...

05:38.538 --> 05:40.096
...stick a pumpkin under its arm...

05:40.273 --> 05:42.833
...and change the nameplate
to Ichabod Crane?

05:47.313 --> 05:50.373
All right. That's it for me.

05:50.550 --> 05:52.245
Good night, everybody.

05:56.823 --> 05:59.849
In your packets you will find
the disease you have been assigned...

06:00.026 --> 06:02.586
...and the symptoms
you will need to exhibit.

06:02.762 --> 06:04.992
Bacterial meningitis.

06:05.164 --> 06:06.859
Jackpot!

06:09.268 --> 06:11.293
Gonorrhea?

06:16.609 --> 06:19.009
-You wanna trade?
-Sorry, buddy.

06:19.178 --> 06:21.146
This is the <i>Hamlet</i> of diseases.

06:21.314 --> 06:25.045
Severe pain, nausea, delusions,
it's got everything.

06:26.252 --> 06:27.617
How about you? You wanna trade?

06:27.787 --> 06:29.084
-Sure.
-Okay, what do you got?

06:29.255 --> 06:31.951
The surgeon left a sponge
inside me.

06:34.260 --> 06:35.921
Good luck with that.

06:37.563 --> 06:39.963
I knew I had hit my high note, so l--

06:40.133 --> 06:42.658
I thanked the crowd and I was gone.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.262
-What'd you do the rest of the day?
-I saw <i>Titanic.</i>

06:47.273 --> 06:49.298
So that old woman...

06:49.509 --> 06:51.477
...she's just a liar, right?

06:51.644 --> 06:54.135
And a bit of a tramp, if you ask me.

06:54.781 --> 06:56.146
-Hello, boys.
-Hey.

06:56.315 --> 06:58.180
Did you give that radio
the old switcheroo?

06:58.351 --> 07:00.546
-I did.
-And the Christian rock?

07:00.720 --> 07:03.052
Resurrected.

07:04.190 --> 07:08.024
And look what I pried
off of his bumper.

07:08.194 --> 07:10.526
A Jesus fish.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.489
Jerry, you have any fish sticks?

07:14.100 --> 07:15.328
No.

07:15.902 --> 07:18.735
So you're disappointed
he's a spiritual person?

07:18.905 --> 07:22.204
Well, yeah. I got him because
he seemed so one-dimensional.

07:22.375 --> 07:24.468
I feel misled.

07:24.644 --> 07:26.202
I think it's neat.

07:26.379 --> 07:28.973
You don't hear that much
about God anymore.

07:31.217 --> 07:32.343
I hear things.

07:34.020 --> 07:36.284
So Sophie gave me the "it's me"
on the phone today.

07:36.456 --> 07:40.415
-"It's me"? Isn't that a little premature?
-I thought so.

07:40.593 --> 07:43.426
She's not a "me." I'm a "me."

07:43.596 --> 07:48.397
I'm against all "it's me"'s.
So self-absorbed and egotistical.

07:48.568 --> 07:52.026
It's like those hip musicians
with their complicated shoes.

07:56.309 --> 07:59.369
Well, I got gonorrhea.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.782
That seems about right.

08:06.953 --> 08:08.682
That's what they gave me.

08:10.389 --> 08:11.856
They?

08:12.758 --> 08:16.023
-The government?
-No, no.

08:16.195 --> 08:19.892
He's pretending he's got gonorrhea
so med students can diagnose it.

08:20.066 --> 08:23.331
And it's a waste of my talent.
It's just a little burning.

08:24.670 --> 08:27.195
Mickey, he got bacterial meningitis.
You know, that's....

08:27.373 --> 08:30.968
Well, I guess there are no
small diseases, only small actors.

08:31.143 --> 08:32.235
Yeah.

08:34.413 --> 08:36.711
All right, that's it for me.

08:36.883 --> 08:38.679
Good night, everybody.

08:40.352 --> 08:41.650
What was that? What was that?

08:41.821 --> 08:44.289
Showmanship. George is trying
to get out on a high note.

08:44.457 --> 08:47.756
See, showmanship. Maybe that's
what my gonorrhea's missing, huh?

08:47.927 --> 08:51.886
Yes. Step into that spotlight and belt
that gonorrhea out to the back row.

08:52.064 --> 08:54.157
Yes. Yes, I will.

08:54.333 --> 08:56.995
I'm gonna make people
feel my gonorrhea...

08:57.169 --> 08:59.831
...and feel the gonorrhea
in themselves.

09:04.477 --> 09:07.071
And are you experiencing
any discomfort?

09:07.246 --> 09:09.840
Oh, just a little burning
during urination.

09:10.016 --> 09:12.382
Okay. Any other pain?

09:12.552 --> 09:16.716
The haunting memories of lost love.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.881
May l? Lights.

09:21.000 --> 09:27.074

09:28.234 --> 09:32.466
Our eyes met
across the crowded hat store.

09:32.638 --> 09:38.304
I, a customer, and she,
a coquettish haberdasher.

09:39.278 --> 09:41.439
I pursued and she withdrew.

09:41.614 --> 09:44.981
And then she pursued
and I withdrew.

09:45.451 --> 09:47.783
And so we danced.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.487
And I burned for her...

09:50.656 --> 09:53.181
...much like the burning
during urination...

09:53.359 --> 09:55.919
...that I would experience
soon afterwards.

09:56.095 --> 09:58.825
-Gonorrhea.
-Gonorrhea.

10:05.504 --> 10:07.597
One message.
Hope it's not from you.

10:08.541 --> 10:11.066
<i>Hey, Jerry, it's me. Call me back.</i>

10:11.243 --> 10:13.507
-Sophie.
-She's still doing that?

10:13.679 --> 10:16.113
-Yep.
-All right, I'll tell you what you do.

10:16.282 --> 10:18.614
You call her back
and give her the "it's me," huh?

10:18.784 --> 10:20.479
Pull the old switcheroo.

10:21.020 --> 10:23.818
That's the "what's good for the goose
is good for the gander."

10:23.990 --> 10:25.924
What the hell is a gander, anyway?

10:26.959 --> 10:30.122
It's a goose that's had
the old switcheroo pulled on her.

10:31.998 --> 10:33.989
Hi, Sophie. It's me.

10:34.500 --> 10:35.626
Hey, Rafe.

10:35.801 --> 10:40.101
-She thinks it's someone named Rafe.
-Good, good. Let her think it.

10:41.207 --> 10:43.004
So, what's going on?

10:45.778 --> 10:47.040
Not a lot.

10:47.213 --> 10:48.840
Ask about you. Ask about you.

10:49.915 --> 10:52.611
So how are things with Jerry?

10:53.486 --> 10:55.113
Oh, I really like him...

10:55.287 --> 10:59.314
...but, well, I still haven't told him
the tractor story.

10:59.492 --> 11:02.723
Right, right, the tractor story.

11:03.396 --> 11:06.229
Are you sick, Rafe?
You sound kind of funny.

11:06.399 --> 11:09.163
-I sound funny?
-Abort. Abort.

11:09.969 --> 11:11.561
Yeah, I better get to a doctor. Bye.

11:15.841 --> 11:17.775
That was close.

11:17.943 --> 11:21.003
What drives me
to take chances like that?

11:21.180 --> 11:22.238
That was very real.

11:22.415 --> 11:25.407
She said there's some tractor story
that she hasn't told me about.

11:25.584 --> 11:28.212
Back it up, back it up.

11:30.356 --> 11:31.687
Tractor story?

11:34.927 --> 11:36.087
What are you doing?

11:41.867 --> 11:46.099
-So where do you wanna eat?
-Feels like an Arby's night.

11:47.573 --> 11:52.374
Arby's. Beef and cheese and....
Do you believe in God?

11:52.545 --> 11:53.569
Yes.

11:54.814 --> 11:57.977
-So you're pretty religious?
-That's right.

11:59.452 --> 12:02.250
So is it a problem
that I'm not really religious?

12:02.421 --> 12:03.683
Not for me.

12:03.856 --> 12:06.416
-Why not?
-I'm not the one going to hell.

12:19.638 --> 12:22.607
You know what I think?
I bet she stole a tractor.

12:22.775 --> 12:26.711
No one's stealing a tractor.
It's a five-mile-an-hour getaway.

12:28.214 --> 12:31.274
We're dancing around the obvious.
It's gotta be disfigurement.

12:31.717 --> 12:34.777
Does she walk around holding a pen
she never seems to need?

12:34.954 --> 12:36.888
No, she looks completely normal.

12:38.224 --> 12:40.852
Okay. Here it is. I got it.

12:41.060 --> 12:43.858
She lost her thumbs
in a tractor accident...

12:44.029 --> 12:47.260
...and they grafted her big toes on.

12:49.301 --> 12:51.166
They do it every day.

12:51.670 --> 12:54.138
You think she's got toes for thumbs?

12:55.007 --> 12:56.872
How's her handshake?

12:57.042 --> 12:58.873
Little firm, isn't it?

12:59.044 --> 13:01.808
-Maybe a little too firm?
-I don't know.

13:02.314 --> 13:04.145
Hands a little smelly?

13:05.718 --> 13:07.686
Why do I seek your counsel?

13:09.655 --> 13:12.647
-Well, I'm going to hell.
-That seems about right.

13:12.825 --> 13:14.315
According to Puddy.

13:14.493 --> 13:17.394
Have you heard the one about the guy
with coffee and doughnuts--?

13:17.563 --> 13:21.124
-I'm not in the mood.
-I'll have some coffee and a doughnut.

13:22.067 --> 13:24.001
What do you care?
You don't believe in hell.

13:24.170 --> 13:25.660
I know, but he does.

13:25.838 --> 13:29.467
So it's more of a relationship problem
than the final destination of your soul?

13:29.642 --> 13:32.202
Well, relationships
are very important to me.

13:32.378 --> 13:34.938
Maybe you can strike one up
with the Prince of Darkness...

13:35.114 --> 13:37.139
...as you burn for all eternity.

13:38.684 --> 13:40.174
And a slice of devil's food cake.

13:45.858 --> 13:48.088
Hey.

13:48.861 --> 13:52.422
-Where is everyone?
-They're all off the project.

13:52.598 --> 13:57.126
They were boring.
George, you are my main man.

13:57.536 --> 13:58.525
I am?

13:58.704 --> 14:01.605
I don't know what it is.
I can't put my finger on it.

14:01.774 --> 14:05.232
But lately, you have just seemed on.

14:05.411 --> 14:09.347
And you always leave me
wanting more.

14:10.916 --> 14:14.545
This is a huge project involving...

14:14.720 --> 14:17.689
...lots of numbers and papers
and folders.

14:17.857 --> 14:21.224
I'm not too worried about it.
Let's get started.

14:21.760 --> 14:23.022
Okay.

14:23.195 --> 14:25.663
-George. Check it out.
-Yeah?

14:26.465 --> 14:28.797
Three times around with no feet.

14:29.435 --> 14:31.062
All me.

14:32.004 --> 14:33.904
All me.

14:36.575 --> 14:39.043
All right. And here are your ailments
for this week.

14:39.211 --> 14:41.736
By the way, Mr. Kramer,
you were excellent.

14:41.914 --> 14:43.211
Thank you.

14:43.382 --> 14:45.612
Cirrhosis of the liver with jaundice.

14:45.784 --> 14:48.082
All right, I get to wear makeup.

14:48.254 --> 14:51.280
-What did you get?
-Gonorrhea.

14:51.757 --> 14:53.588
Excuse me,
I think there's been a mistake.

14:53.759 --> 14:55.124
See, I had gonorrhea last week.

14:55.294 --> 14:58.263
Oh, it's no mistake.
We loved what you did with it.

15:01.467 --> 15:05.460
Boy, I don't believe this.
I'm being typecast.

15:08.140 --> 15:11.041
I move my knight here.

15:11.277 --> 15:12.266
Check.

15:12.444 --> 15:16.540
They should update these pieces.
Nobody rides horses anymore.

15:17.216 --> 15:19.946
Maybe they should change it
to a tractor.

15:20.753 --> 15:22.744
Jerry, are you embarrassed
that you're losing?

15:22.922 --> 15:24.287
Losing?

15:24.456 --> 15:28.654
You know, yesterday I lost control
of my car, almost bought the farm.

15:29.295 --> 15:31.092
Bought the farm?

15:31.664 --> 15:32.824
Tractor.

15:34.233 --> 15:36.463
This is an odd side of you, Jerry.

15:37.303 --> 15:38.736
I feel uncomfortable.

15:39.271 --> 15:42.297
Wait, don't go. Let's thumb-wrestle.

15:48.447 --> 15:49.607
A scar?

15:49.782 --> 15:53.843
A big long scar, where her leg
would dangle when she's riding a--

15:54.019 --> 15:55.111
A tractor.

15:55.287 --> 15:58.586
I'm sure she's a little self-conscious
and doesn't like to talk about it.

15:58.757 --> 16:01.658
She's more self-conscious about that
than her toe-thumbs.

16:01.827 --> 16:03.954
She doesn't have toe-thumbs.

16:05.297 --> 16:08.630
-She will if she keeps horsing around--
-All right.

16:09.301 --> 16:11.599
So how's the two-man operation
at Kruger?

16:11.770 --> 16:15.206
Two-man. It's all me.
Kruger doesn't do anything.

16:15.374 --> 16:18.969
Disappears for hours at a time,
gives me fake excuses.

16:19.144 --> 16:22.011
This afternoon, I found him
with sleep creases on his face.

16:22.548 --> 16:24.675
The only reason I got out
to get a bite today...

16:24.850 --> 16:28.013
...was that he finally promised to
buckle down and do some actual work.

16:30.356 --> 16:32.620
Oh, I don't believe this.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.724
This is what I have to put up with,
Jerry.

16:39.698 --> 16:41.063
Mr. Kruger.

16:41.233 --> 16:44.031
Who said he was going to do
some actual work today?

16:44.203 --> 16:46.728
-Who?
-I'm not too worried about it.

16:47.639 --> 16:49.106
Well, I am.

16:49.274 --> 16:52.835
Couldn't you try to go through some
of that stuff I put in your shoebox?

16:53.012 --> 16:55.503
All right, all right, I'm going.

16:57.883 --> 17:00.044
Have you ever seen
anything like this?

17:00.519 --> 17:02.214
Never.

17:07.259 --> 17:10.455
Elaine, they forgot to deliver
your paper today.

17:10.896 --> 17:14.423
-Why don't you just grab that one?
-But that belongs to Mr. Potato Guy.

17:14.599 --> 17:16.329
-That's his.
-Come on, get it.

17:18.771 --> 17:22.867
-Well, if you want it, you get it.
-Sorry, thou shalt not steal.

17:25.778 --> 17:27.905
Oh, but it's okay for me?

17:28.079 --> 17:30.412
Oh, what do you care?
You know where you're going.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.844
All right, that is it.
I can't live like this.

17:34.019 --> 17:35.577
-Oh, no.
-Come on.

17:35.754 --> 17:37.517
All right, what did I do?

17:38.090 --> 17:40.752
David, I'm going to hell.

17:40.926 --> 17:42.917
The worst place in the world.

17:43.095 --> 17:47.998
With devils and those caves
and the ragged clothing.

17:48.167 --> 17:51.364
And the heat, my God, the heat!

17:51.537 --> 17:54.938
-What do you think about all that?
-It's gonna be rough.

17:55.974 --> 17:58.807
-You should be trying to save me.
-Don't boss me.

17:58.977 --> 18:01.571
-This is why you're going to hell.
-I am not going to hell.

18:01.747 --> 18:05.183
And if you think I'm going to hell,
you should care that I'm going to hell...

18:05.350 --> 18:06.783
...even though I am not.

18:08.287 --> 18:12.724
-You stole my Jesus fish, didn't you?
-Yeah, that's right.

18:17.930 --> 18:20.899
My liver. Why did I drink
for all those years?

18:21.467 --> 18:24.868
Why did I look for love in a bottle?

18:25.471 --> 18:27.496
Mr. Kramer, you're up.

18:29.174 --> 18:30.505
Oh, hey, Mickey.

18:30.676 --> 18:31.768
-Wait a minute.
-What?

18:31.944 --> 18:35.243
-You are doing gonorrhea, aren't you?
-Yeah, well, we'll see.

18:37.483 --> 18:40.816
So, what seems to be bothering you
today, Mr. Kramer?

18:40.986 --> 18:42.078
Well, l--

18:42.254 --> 18:46.918
I guess it started about 20 years ago
when I got back from Vietnam.

18:47.092 --> 18:50.118
And this was the only friend
I had left.

18:50.295 --> 18:54.322
Hey! That's my cirrhosis!
He's stealing my cirrhosis!

18:54.500 --> 18:57.799
You wanna be sick?
I'll make you sick!

18:58.770 --> 19:01.830
Cirrhosis of the liver
and PCP addiction?

19:06.245 --> 19:07.803
Let me see if I understand this.

19:08.280 --> 19:11.716
You're concerned that he isn't
concerned that you're going to hell.

19:11.884 --> 19:13.852
And you feel that she's too bossy.

19:14.820 --> 19:16.685
-Yeah, that's right.
-Yeah, that's right.

19:17.189 --> 19:20.420
Well, oftentimes,
in cases of interfaith marriages...

19:20.592 --> 19:22.321
...couples have difficulty--

19:23.095 --> 19:24.687
No one's getting married here.

19:24.863 --> 19:26.694
-You aren't?
-No.

19:28.033 --> 19:29.625
We're just, you know...

19:29.801 --> 19:31.826
...having a good time.

19:35.874 --> 19:39.071
Well, then it's simple.
You're both going to hell.

19:39.811 --> 19:42.837
No way. This is bogus, man.

19:44.316 --> 19:45.715
Well, thank you, Father.

19:46.218 --> 19:48.209
Did you hear the one
about the guy in hell...

19:48.387 --> 19:50.719
...who's talking to the devil
by the coffee machine?

19:50.889 --> 19:53.380
I'm really not in the mood.
I'm going to hell.

19:54.726 --> 19:56.125
Lighten up.

19:56.295 --> 19:58.855
It'll only feel like an eternity.

20:06.939 --> 20:10.773
You know, Jerry, there's this thing
that I haven't told you about.

20:10.943 --> 20:15.812
See, there was this tractor, and....

20:17.082 --> 20:19.573
You know, boy, this is--
This is really difficult.

20:19.751 --> 20:21.343
Sophie...

20:21.520 --> 20:22.919
...it's me.

20:24.523 --> 20:28.584
I know about the tractor story
and I'm fine with it.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.591
How could you know?

20:34.700 --> 20:35.689
It's not important.

20:35.867 --> 20:38.995
What's important is I'm not gonna
let a little thing like that...

20:39.171 --> 20:44.438
...ruin what could be a very long-term
and meaningful relationship.

20:45.043 --> 20:46.442
I didn't say that, no.

20:46.612 --> 20:48.671
You gave me gonorrhea,
you didn't even tell me!

20:48.847 --> 20:50.109
Well, I'm sorry.

20:50.282 --> 20:53.843
I gave you gonorrhea because
I thought you'd have fun with it.

20:54.019 --> 20:56.214
Hey, hey, I'm with someone.

20:57.656 --> 20:59.055
Hello.

20:59.558 --> 21:03.324
No, I understand. This could be
a tough thing to deal with.

21:03.495 --> 21:07.124
The important thing is that you have
a partner who's supportive.

21:07.899 --> 21:10.800
You know, she's right.

21:11.637 --> 21:15.801
Unfortunately, I didn't have a partner.
I got gonorrhea from a tractor.

21:17.242 --> 21:19.767
You got gonorrhea from a tractor?

21:19.945 --> 21:22.743
And you call that the tractor story?

21:22.914 --> 21:24.939
You can't get it from that.

21:25.117 --> 21:27.176
But I did. My boyfriend said
I got gonorrhea...

21:27.352 --> 21:29.946
...from riding the tractor
in my bathing suit.

21:30.122 --> 21:33.421
All right, that's it for me.
You've been great.

21:33.592 --> 21:35.617
Good night, everybody.

21:58.216 --> 22:01.447
Would you mind helping me out
with some of this stuff?

22:02.154 --> 22:04.145
You seem like you've got
a good handle on it.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.984
No, I don't!

22:06.158 --> 22:09.059
Don't you even care?
This is your company.

22:09.227 --> 22:12.196
It's your name
on the outside of the building.

22:12.364 --> 22:16.824
Speaking of which, the R fell off
and all it says now is "K-uger."

22:17.002 --> 22:19.800
K-uger. That sounds like
one of those old-time car horns, huh?

22:19.971 --> 22:22.405
K-uger! K-uger!

22:25.277 --> 22:28.542
You are too much, Mr. Kruger.
Too much.

22:28.714 --> 22:31.683
Thank you, George.
You've been great. That's it for me.

22:31.850 --> 22:34.683
Oh, no, you're not going out
on a high note with me, Mr. Kruger.

22:34.853 --> 22:36.582
It's K-uger.

22:36.988 --> 22:38.922
No! No!

22:39.091 --> 22:41.582
Good night, everybody.
