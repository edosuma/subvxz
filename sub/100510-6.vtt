Who is it? Who is after me?

A group of Jews from New York.

03:01.557 --> 03:03.642
Well funded.

03:03.684 --> 03:08.230
Well armed. Led by a rich rat

Looks like she meant it.

05:34.293 --> 05:35.753
Out?

They are not taking this away.
Not again.

05:50.017 --> 05:52.102
They get nothing from me.
You understand?

05:55.189 --> 05:57.649
Listen, Meyer assured me

05:57.691 --> 05:59.651
that everything's
going to be all right.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.945
He arranged for extra security.

-Gangsters?

You-you know, Bernie Flagelstein
went to them for help once.

06:08.827 --> 06:11.663
- Y-Yeah.
- Everyone knows
what happened to him.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.373
Yeah, he came back
without his flagel.

06:13.415 --> 06:16.126
Yeah. But Meyer
is not Bernie Flagelstein.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.589
The wedding will go on.

06:20.631 --> 06:22.549
- Ah, geez...
- You'll be all right.

Hmm.

06:24.635 --> 06:27.429
Yeah, you're a regular
Florence Nightingale.

06:27.471 --> 06:29.264
Yeah, and you're
a regular shvantz.

Groundhog's looking

06:50.869 --> 06:53.247
Uh, a little
light bathroom reading.

06:53.288 --> 06:55.457
- Uh-huh?
- Found it at Tilda's.

06:55.499 --> 06:57.835

freaky book club,

- Find out what it means.
- Yep.

07:03.215 --> 07:05.801

dreidels into the Dead Sea.

07:05.843 --> 07:09.012

Yes.

07:11.056 --> 07:13.142
But was I wrong?

07:13.183 --> 07:14.560
Of course not.

07:14.601 --> 07:18.397
Instinct is important, Lonny.

07:18.438 --> 07:21.233
Instinct is everything.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.861
Instinct, huh?

07:23.902 --> 07:26.613
That's what made you
murder her in cold blood?

07:27.865 --> 07:30.450
In cold blood?

07:30.492 --> 07:32.119
We're in a war, Lonny.

07:35.747 --> 07:38.584

No, no, no.
He's gonna stay for the wedding.

Jonah's reciting
the Birkat Kohanim.

07:44.339 --> 07:45.883
Break a leg.

07:45.924 --> 07:48.069
W-Wait, wait, what? What?
W-What are you talking about?

07:48.093 --> 07:50.095
The world's going to hell
and you want me to stay

07:50.137 --> 07:51.656
- t-to say a fucking prayer? No.
- No, it-it...

07:51.680 --> 07:53.320
- No, that's not...
- The Hunt is not only

07:53.348 --> 07:56.852
- That's fucking crazy. No. No.
- About death, Jonah. No.

07:56.894 --> 07:58.896
It's about life, too.

08:00.731 --> 08:03.358
It is a great tragedy to me

08:03.400 --> 08:06.737
not to celebrate
what it is we do have.

08:06.778 --> 08:09.031
Some Nazis blew up your car.

08:09.072 --> 08:11.116
All right?
Roxy almost died, uh,

08:11.158 --> 08:13.202
Harriet turned on us
and you think that some ritual

08:13.243 --> 08:14.429
is more important
than me unraveling...

08:14.453 --> 08:17.414
I don't think it, I know it.

08:17.456 --> 08:20.459
Jonah, for centuries

08:20.500 --> 08:24.421
we've been persecuted
because of these rituals.

08:24.463 --> 08:27.299
These are the very things
that define us.

08:27.341 --> 08:28.926
That make us us.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.510
Retreating from that...

08:30.552 --> 08:32.554
That's defeat.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.808
And I'm not ready
to admit defeat.

08:36.850 --> 08:38.852
Are you?

08:48.779 --> 08:52.366
Didn't get a chance
to say goodbye the other night.

08:52.407 --> 08:55.953
Holy shit.
What happened?

08:55.994 --> 08:58.163
You were right.

08:58.205 --> 09:00.999
Two guys ambushed me
in the bathroom of that place.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.377
Jesus.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.379
I was all pissed.

09:05.420 --> 09:08.298
Figured you'd skipped out,
left me with the check.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.425
31 bucks.

09:10.467 --> 09:13.887
It just took me an hour
to get back up.

09:13.929 --> 09:17.391
I am telling you, they were FBI.

09:17.432 --> 09:19.810
Danny, we don't know that.

09:22.437 --> 09:25.232
Look, I need you to connect me
to your source again.

09:25.274 --> 09:27.234
What source?

09:27.276 --> 09:29.611
Thought I was just some kook
looking for company.

09:29.653 --> 09:31.947
Look, I'm sorry
about that, okay?

09:31.989 --> 09:34.366
I got this
black-and-blue makeover

09:34.408 --> 09:36.410
and this bruised rib
that hurts like hell

09:36.451 --> 09:38.787
every time I try to breathe,
if it makes you feel better.

09:38.829 --> 09:40.831
It doesn't make me feel better.

09:44.876 --> 09:48.255
There is a warehouse off of
Canal Street down by the water.

09:48.297 --> 09:51.133
Give me a few hours,
I'll make sure he's there.

09:51.174 --> 09:53.844
If the FBI didn't already
scare him off.

09:53.885 --> 09:56.305
But I am sitting this one out.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.057
Hope you can understand why.

10:07.024 --> 10:09.234
We're closed.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.902
Also, fuck you.

10:12.154 --> 10:14.281
Yeah, I missed you too, dude.

10:14.323 --> 10:16.325
What the hell are you
even doing here?

10:17.826 --> 10:19.661
Came to pick up my suit.

10:19.703 --> 10:22.664
And I wanted to talk to you.

10:22.706 --> 10:24.291
Obviously, not in that order.

10:24.333 --> 10:26.335
Pretty sure that suit
got thrown out,

10:26.376 --> 10:28.479
after, you know, you blew off
your best friend's funeral.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.672
Dickhead.

10:30.714 --> 10:33.216
Look, man, I brought
a peace offering, all right?

10:34.509 --> 10:36.720
Pretty meager peace offering.

10:38.347 --> 10:41.558
It's the best I can do
under the circumstances.

10:51.693 --> 10:55.614
Well, can't wait to hear these
motherfucking circumstances.

10:57.699 --> 11:00.077
Nazi Hunters?
You're fucking with me.

11:00.118 --> 11:02.537
I'm not fucking with you.

11:04.623 --> 11:08.418
Fuck. Fuck.

11:10.045 --> 11:12.005
So that guy came
into the comic book shop

11:12.047 --> 11:14.508
- looking for...
- Me.

11:14.549 --> 11:17.803
He was looking for me.
Booty's dead because of me.

11:17.844 --> 11:20.138
Jesus.

11:20.180 --> 11:24.142
Fucking Nazis, man?

11:24.184 --> 11:26.812
How was it? The funeral?

11:28.063 --> 11:29.940
Well, you know,
there were no strippers

11:29.981 --> 11:31.942
dancing on his coffin
to Led Zep, man.

11:31.983 --> 11:34.444
Whole thing was
fucking depressing.

11:34.486 --> 11:36.446
I sent fucking flowers.

11:36.488 --> 11:38.615
Yeah.

11:38.657 --> 11:40.617
Saw those.

11:40.659 --> 11:42.869
Spent all your drug money
on that display, huh?

11:42.911 --> 11:44.579
Everything my safta left me.

11:44.621 --> 11:46.623
Yeah.

11:47.999 --> 11:49.418
Were they nice?

11:51.503 --> 11:53.713
Yeah, man. They were,
they were real nice.

11:59.678 --> 12:02.180
Carol and I knew you were
in trouble with the FBI, man.

12:02.222 --> 12:04.349
- We could've helped.
- Dude, I c...

12:04.391 --> 12:09.688
I can't risk anything happening
to either one of you.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.356
That's why I've stayed away.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.191
Well, you won't have
to worry about me.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.652
I'm off to Oneonta SUNY
for orientation.

12:15.694 --> 12:17.446
It's supposed to be
all beer and boobs.

12:17.487 --> 12:20.240
- Boob-eonta.
- Boob-me-want-a.

12:20.282 --> 12:22.617
Yeah.

12:22.659 --> 12:26.246
So you just make sure
you see me before I go, okay?

12:26.288 --> 12:28.999
Come on, man.
I fucking love you, man.

12:32.085 --> 12:34.963
Couple weeks ago,
you're scared to talk to girls.

12:35.005 --> 12:39.634
Now you're hunting
fucking Nazis. Shit.

12:41.136 --> 12:43.096
You gonna be okay?

12:43.138 --> 12:45.557
Of course. Yeah.

12:48.560 --> 12:50.395
I don't know.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.063
I'll see you, man.

13:03.074 --> 13:05.035
Hola, Juanita.

13:05.076 --> 13:07.263
Did you happen to have a chance
to talk to the president about

13:07.287 --> 13:09.998
letting those South American
goods back in the U.S.?

13:10.040 --> 13:12.459
- No, Biff, I certainly didn't.
- Well, why not?

13:12.501 --> 13:14.628
Because I don't agree
with the policy.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.671
- That's why not.
- Eh, you...
Good morning.

13:16.713 --> 13:19.049
Good morning, Mr. President.

13:19.090 --> 13:20.884
Before we get started...

13:20.926 --> 13:24.971
And I think I speak
for everyone here...

13:25.013 --> 13:28.099
It surely is swell
to have you back, Biff.

13:28.141 --> 13:30.936
Thank you, Mr. President.

13:30.977 --> 13:36.566
No words can describe how much
it means to me, but I'll try.

13:36.608 --> 13:40.195
When you experience
a life-changing tragedy

13:40.237 --> 13:42.656
like the whopper thrown my way,

13:42.697 --> 13:47.035
well, you do some reevaluating
about what's important.

13:47.077 --> 13:48.995
About who you are.

13:49.037 --> 13:52.165
And you know who we are, sir?

13:52.207 --> 13:53.792
We're peanut farmers.

13:53.833 --> 13:57.462
Which is to say we're Americans.

13:57.504 --> 14:02.467
We overlook our homegrown values
at our peril.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.220
And that is why I say
Secretary Kreps' support

14:05.262 --> 14:08.473
to veto the bill
is well-intentioned but naive.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.476
I mean, does her heart
even thump

14:11.518 --> 14:14.729
- with red, white and blue blood?
- Mr. President,
that is not what...

14:14.771 --> 14:17.524
After what happened to me,
I don't know how to be governed

14:17.566 --> 14:19.901
by anything but this ticker
right here.

14:19.943 --> 14:23.154
And you know what my heart
tells me, sir?

14:23.196 --> 14:25.740
If the South Americans
can't bring their goods

14:25.782 --> 14:29.077
to market here, they're gonna
climb in bed with the Commies.

14:29.119 --> 14:31.288
Is that what we want
in our backyard?

14:31.329 --> 14:34.666
No, the only thing that we
should have in our backyards

14:34.708 --> 14:36.293
are Slip 'N Slides

14:36.334 --> 14:40.839
and wieners on the grill
and-and capitalist women

14:40.880 --> 14:45.635
in itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny,
yellow polka-dot bikinis.

14:47.304 --> 14:51.808
So, Mr. President,
you must sign the bill

29:23.512 --> 29:25.449
When the incriminating documents
were removed from their files...

29:25.473 --> 29:27.057
- Yeah.
- The only proof

29:27.099 --> 29:30.060
of their sordid past was the
tiny imprint of a paper clip.

29:30.102 --> 29:31.770
- Okay.
- We brought in thousands

29:31.812 --> 29:34.106
through that program
and other ops like it.

29:34.148 --> 29:36.650
Shuttled them in,
whitewashed their documents

29:36.692 --> 29:38.652
and guaranteed them
a life of star-spangled,

29:38.694 --> 29:39.945
apple-pie Americana.

29:39.987 --> 29:42.740
And you can verify this?

29:44.700 --> 29:46.785
Yeah, yeah.

29:50.581 --> 29:53.792
Pietr... Hans Fischer?

29:53.834 --> 29:56.212
Oh, my God. I need those files.

29:56.253 --> 29:57.814
I need this. No one's gonna
believe this story

29:57.838 --> 30:00.216
- without the files.
- That is not
my problem.

30:00.257 --> 30:02.194
Look, you can't just drop this
on my lap and walk away.

30:02.218 --> 30:04.678
And I can't have a file
traced back to me.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.014
Look, I couldn't live
with myself if I didn't tell you

30:07.056 --> 30:09.242
what I know, but that doesn't
mean I don't want to live,

30:09.266 --> 30:10.434
Agent Morris.

30:10.476 --> 30:12.269
These are the kind of people

30:12.311 --> 30:15.731
who will kill you
and everyone you love.

30:15.773 --> 30:18.108
The kind of people who will
make your little face injury

30:18.150 --> 30:19.610
look like a walk in the park.

30:21.695 --> 30:24.132
You figure out the rest and you
bring these bastards to justice.

30:24.156 --> 30:25.533
Just leave me out of it.

30:25.574 --> 30:27.785
I'm sorry.
I've got a train to catch.

31:05.739 --> 31:08.242
Everyone out!

31:13.831 --> 31:14.915
Men on the left!

31:14.957 --> 31:18.002
Women and children to the right!

31:18.043 --> 31:19.086
Go on!

31:23.882 --> 31:25.676
Men on the left!

31:25.718 --> 31:28.095
Women and children to the right!

31:28.137 --> 31:29.471
Men on the left!

31:29.513 --> 31:31.640
Women and children to the right!

31:31.682 --> 31:34.018
Why?

31:34.059 --> 31:36.437
So we can process your papers
more quickly.

31:36.478 --> 31:39.648
You'll be together inside.

31:39.690 --> 31:42.359
Something's... wrong.
Stay together.

31:42.401 --> 31:45.487
- My love...
- Stay together, you understand?

31:45.529 --> 31:47.531
Just hold my hand, Aaron.
It's okay.

31:47.573 --> 31:48.574
Papa?

31:50.367 --> 31:52.620
Everything will be fine, my boy.

31:53.996 --> 31:55.623
I won't let you go.

31:55.664 --> 31:57.833
Did you not hear me?

31:57.875 --> 32:00.836
Men on the left!

32:00.878 --> 32:02.630
No, no, no, no.

32:02.671 --> 32:04.548
- Mindelah.
- Mami! Mami!

32:04.590 --> 32:07.176
Women and children to the right!

32:07.217 --> 32:08.886
Mami!

32:08.927 --> 32:10.429
I said, children right!

32:10.471 --> 32:13.098
No, no, no, it's all right.

32:13.140 --> 32:14.892
He'll stay with me, his father.

32:14.933 --> 32:15.893
I said, right!

32:15.934 --> 32:17.287
We're getting back together
anyways...

32:17.311 --> 32:19.688
Please... let him stay here
with me, his father...

32:19.730 --> 32:20.856
He's staying here.

32:20.898 --> 32:22.316
Let him go!

32:22.358 --> 32:24.693
We need to stay together.

32:26.403 --> 32:27.404
Step away!

32:27.446 --> 32:28.656
Nein! Nein!

32:28.697 --> 32:30.866
I won't leave my child.

32:30.908 --> 32:32.284
I won't.

32:32.326 --> 32:34.411
What is the holdup?

32:34.453 --> 32:36.622
Sorry for the delay, sir.

32:36.664 --> 32:39.500
Please.

32:39.541 --> 32:40.542
This is my child.

32:42.961 --> 32:43.921
This is my child.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.089
This is...

32:45.130 --> 32:46.340
my child. Please.

32:52.596 --> 32:53.555
Just take the boy, goddamn it.

32:53.597 --> 32:54.807
Enough with the sniveling.

32:54.848 --> 32:58.852
I won't let you go.
I won't let you go.

33:00.062 --> 33:01.271
I won't let you go.

33:11.615 --> 33:15.494
Aaron! Aaron!

33:19.581 --> 33:21.083
I won't let you go.

33:23.252 --> 33:25.337
I won't let you go.

33:37.933 --> 33:40.310
- Murray.
- Huh?

33:47.401 --> 33:49.862
You can let go now, Dad.

33:56.994 --> 34:00.956
I now invite
the parents of the bride

34:00.998 --> 34:03.167
to recite the fifth

34:03.208 --> 34:05.753
of the seven blessings.

34:07.796 --> 34:11.383
Sos tasis v'tagel ha-akarah

34:11.425 --> 34:16.388
b'kibbutz bane'ha
letocha b'simchaa,

34:16.430 --> 34:18.932
Baruch Atah Adonai, mesame'ach

34:18.974 --> 34:21.810
tzion b'vaneha.

34:23.270 --> 34:25.272
Amen.

34:26.857 --> 34:29.693
Amen.

34:29.735 --> 34:33.030
Even as we remember
the darkness,

34:33.071 --> 34:35.324
we celebrate the light.

34:40.037 --> 34:41.038
Mazel tov!

34:51.089 --> 34:52.841
Mazel tov!

35:01.308 --> 35:03.685
- Biff.
- Would love to gird and gab,

35:03.727 --> 35:05.979
but Love Boat's on in 20

35:06.021 --> 35:07.981
and Dottie's making
hot fudge squares.

35:08.023 --> 35:10.526
You conniving little reptile.

35:10.567 --> 35:15.489
Boy, Juanie, uh, normally,
I'd tell you I'm sorry

35:15.531 --> 35:20.202
if following my moral compass
caused you strife.

35:20.244 --> 35:23.080
But Dr. Susan,
my grief counselor,

35:23.121 --> 35:26.083
she said, "Biff,
since the gruesome murders

35:26.124 --> 35:28.126
"of your wife and children,

35:28.168 --> 35:31.255
"you've spent every day
apologizing

35:31.296 --> 35:33.215
"that you were the one
who lived.

35:33.257 --> 35:35.050
No more apologizing."

35:35.092 --> 35:38.595
So, Dr. Susan's words, not mine.

35:38.637 --> 35:40.013
Classic Dr. Susan.

35:40.055 --> 35:42.015
Now you want to throw me
under the bus

35:42.057 --> 35:43.642
to make a name for yourself?

35:43.684 --> 35:45.477
You just wait
till I show everyone

35:45.519 --> 35:49.356
what a despicable, unscrupulous
monster you really are.

35:50.858 --> 35:54.361
"Juanita Kreps."

35:54.403 --> 35:58.740
Sounds like
a Mexican French pancake.

35:58.782 --> 36:01.660
Like, choose a cuisine,
would you?

36:01.702 --> 36:04.079
Now, listen,

36:04.121 --> 36:08.041
you maraca-shaking, mariachi
band gangbanging old sombrero,

36:08.083 --> 36:11.545
you stay the fuck out
of my way, or the only cabinet

36:11.587 --> 36:15.465
you'll find yourself in is
the one in my goddamn basement,

36:15.507 --> 36:19.636
into which I'll stuff you like
dog meat in a breakfast chalupa.

36:19.678 --> 36:21.847
Great to habla with you.

36:21.889 --> 36:25.559
Eh? Let's do it again real soon.

36:44.119 --> 36:48.749
Uh, Johnnie Walker, Red,
on the rocks, please.

36:50.959 --> 36:53.921
So, are you ready for this?

36:53.962 --> 36:56.673
I'm more fucked than a
sea cucumber at a mermaid orgy.

36:59.301 --> 37:00.719
Never heard that before.

37:00.761 --> 37:03.889
You'll be all right.

37:03.931 --> 37:06.266
All right, everyone,
put your hentelakh together

37:06.308 --> 37:08.101
for Jonah Heidelbaum.

37:08.143 --> 37:10.187
- You're on. Good foot.
- All right, wish me luck.

37:10.228 --> 37:12.147
Right. Good luck.

37:12.189 --> 37:14.483
Jonah!

37:14.524 --> 37:16.860
You're all right, Jonah.

37:21.031 --> 37:22.199
Um...

37:22.240 --> 37:24.451
Uh...

37:28.455 --> 37:30.874
Ah, there we go.

37:33.460 --> 37:35.629
Uh...

37:35.671 --> 37:38.799
Y-Y'var-ekh...

37:38.840 --> 37:40.842
Y'var-ekh'cha...

37:40.884 --> 37:42.219
Y'var-ekh'cha...

37:42.260 --> 37:43.637
A-do-nai

37:43.679 --> 37:46.181
v'yeesh'm'recha...

37:47.849 --> 37:52.270
Ya-eir A-do-nai pa-nav

37:52.312 --> 37:55.315
ei-ley-cha...

37:59.611 --> 38:02.447
Uh, how you doing tonight,
Brooklyn?

38:02.489 --> 38:05.409
How you feeling?

38:05.450 --> 38:07.202
We're all right.

38:07.244 --> 38:09.079
I'm sorry,

38:09.121 --> 38:11.123
I just wanted to a-a...

38:11.164 --> 38:14.543
apologize for, uh,
butchering that,

38:14.584 --> 38:17.546
the-the Birkat, uh, Kohanim.

38:17.587 --> 38:19.297
As-as some of you
may already know,

38:19.339 --> 38:23.093
I'm a last-minute replacement,
filling in for my safta.

38:23.135 --> 38:24.970
Ruth.

38:26.888 --> 38:31.059
Who would be really disappointed
in me right now.

38:31.101 --> 38:34.271
Um...

38:34.312 --> 38:38.191
But there is this one prayer,

38:38.233 --> 38:41.737
this one prayer
that I do know pretty well

38:41.778 --> 38:44.865
because my safta,
she used to say it every night.

38:46.908 --> 38:50.537
Every night.
She said it gave her courage

38:50.579 --> 38:54.041
and hope on her worst days.

38:54.082 --> 38:58.628
She said it was stronger
than any weapon or armor.

38:58.670 --> 39:04.176
She said that this prayer,
the Birkhas HaGomel,

39:04.217 --> 39:07.637
gave her superpowers
and shit, so... Stuff.

39:07.679 --> 39:09.306
I-I'm, uh, sorry.

39:09.347 --> 39:12.517
Sorry. Uh, stuff.

39:12.559 --> 39:14.227
Don't mean to curse.

39:14.269 --> 39:17.230
Uh, so, uh,

39:17.272 --> 39:21.818
y-you know, I thought
I would say it tonight for you,

39:21.860 --> 39:24.321
Amy and Ben.

39:24.362 --> 39:26.448
From me.

39:27.699 --> 39:32.120
And so, from her.

39:39.336 --> 39:43.465
Baruch ata Adonai

39:43.507 --> 39:46.051
Eloheinu melech ha-olam...

39:46.093 --> 39:51.515
ha-gomel l'chayavim tovos

39:51.556 --> 39:55.560
she-g'malani kol tuv.

40:05.278 --> 40:07.239
Mazel tov.

40:07.280 --> 40:08.657
- Mazel tov!
- Mazel tov!

40:12.369 --> 40:13.787
That's good.

40:15.288 --> 40:17.249
Nice job, Jonah.

40:19.417 --> 40:22.379
So, let me
get this straight.
Mm-hmm.

40:22.420 --> 40:24.840
We got The Toymaker. We got
The Chemist and her brother,

40:24.881 --> 40:28.468
the disappearing detective and
his pregnant wife in Florida,

40:28.510 --> 40:31.555
the kook of a journalist,
the kid in the comic shop.

40:31.596 --> 40:33.783
Oh, and dead grandma in Brooklyn
and her orphan grandson

40:33.807 --> 40:36.560
who you think is in cahoots with
the millionaire Meyer Offerman.

40:36.601 --> 40:38.186
I know it sounds crazy,
but it's...

40:38.228 --> 40:40.564
And all this led you to...
what did he call it?

40:40.605 --> 40:42.941
Operation Paperclip, sir.

40:46.194 --> 40:48.363
And why is this the first
I'm hearing of this?

40:48.405 --> 40:52.450
I didn't think you would
listen to me, sir.

40:52.492 --> 40:54.494
Well, I'm listening now.

41:01.251 --> 41:03.420
You're gonna have to take
a beat on this one.

41:05.130 --> 41:07.507
I was fucking right.
I knew you wouldn't believe me.

41:07.549 --> 41:09.509
I'm not benching you
because I don't believe you.

41:09.551 --> 41:11.094
I'm benching you because I do.

41:11.136 --> 41:13.180
Look at your face, Morris.

41:15.223 --> 41:17.017
I got to run this up the chain.

41:17.058 --> 41:19.394
Before you do
any other solo work.

41:20.562 --> 41:22.606
So it's above my pay grade now?

41:22.647 --> 41:24.399
I think it's above mine.

41:24.441 --> 41:26.818
If this is as big
as you say it is,

41:26.860 --> 41:29.821
if your source is right,

41:29.863 --> 41:32.407
I got to be the one
that looks into it. Understand?

41:45.337 --> 41:46.755
There's the temple.

41:46.796 --> 41:48.965
You leave the old Jew for me.

41:50.884 --> 41:53.762
Fuck. The Kosher Nostra.

41:56.056 --> 41:58.266
What are you doing?

41:58.308 --> 41:59.893
You know they're all armed.

41:59.935 --> 42:03.396
And I've got a better idea.

42:03.438 --> 42:04.731
You coward!

42:14.199 --> 42:17.577
Thank you. Uh, yeah.

42:20.664 --> 42:21.831
Oh...

42:21.873 --> 42:22.958
- Great job, kid.
- Hi.

42:22.999 --> 42:24.125
Thank you.

42:34.928 --> 42:36.513
It was nice talking to you.

42:36.554 --> 42:38.723
And I hope I don't
see you again.

42:38.765 --> 42:40.809
That's an old joke.
If I see you again...

42:40.850 --> 42:43.728
If I don't, hello.

42:43.770 --> 42:45.897
Ah, look who's there.

42:48.441 --> 42:52.779
More of a celebrity
than Art Garfunkel.

42:52.821 --> 42:56.825
Art Garfunkel is the furry taint
of famous Jews,

42:56.866 --> 42:59.411
- so thanks?
- Really?

42:59.452 --> 43:02.247
I think Art Garfunkel
has a good voice.

43:02.289 --> 43:04.249
Beautiful.

43:04.291 --> 43:06.418
Hey, uh, h-how come
you don't wear a chai necklace

43:06.459 --> 43:08.211
when all the other Jewish dudes
have one?

43:11.256 --> 43:15.802
Because I gave the necklace away
to the woman I loved,

43:15.844 --> 43:18.930
and I've never worn one since.

43:18.972 --> 43:20.765
Give me that.

43:20.807 --> 43:23.560
It belonged to your grandfather.

43:23.601 --> 43:25.562
Wait, you m...

43:26.813 --> 43:28.398
Wait...

43:28.440 --> 43:31.026
Oh, hi.

44:24.913 --> 44:27.290
Are you okay?

44:27.332 --> 44:30.460
What's the matter? The hora spun
the roast in your stomach?

44:32.295 --> 44:34.255
What?

44:34.297 --> 44:37.342
- I get it.
- You get what?

44:37.384 --> 44:41.346
My safta always wanted me
to feel...

44:42.931 --> 44:44.641
part of our people.

44:47.644 --> 44:49.020
Part of our tribe.

44:51.106 --> 44:52.357
L'chaim.
