WEBVTT

00:06.223 --> 00:08.182
Hey, babe, I'm about
to start the slow cooker.

00:08.182 --> 00:09.966
If your parents have
any food allergies,

00:09.966 --> 00:12.316
speak now or forever
hold your peace.

00:12.316 --> 00:14.362
Nichelle?

00:14.362 --> 00:16.886
- Sorry. No food allergies.
- Cool.

00:16.886 --> 00:18.018
Now it is

00:18.018 --> 00:20.498
breakfast time
for two. Mmm. Okay.

00:23.806 --> 00:27.984
Hey, if anybody should be
nervous about tonight, it's me.

00:27.984 --> 00:30.204
I'm the one who's got to meet
your folks for the first time.

00:30.204 --> 00:33.076
I've told you
my dad is an idealistic man,

00:33.076 --> 00:34.904
very opinionated...

00:34.904 --> 00:37.080
You don't become the
Dean of Social Sciences

00:37.080 --> 00:40.170
- unless you got opinions.
- My mom, too.

00:40.170 --> 00:42.303
What made her such a good
real estate agent was being...

00:42.303 --> 00:44.827
judgy about everything.

00:44.827 --> 00:48.396
You just described a whole bunch
of parents, including my own.

00:48.396 --> 00:51.138
I am so excited to finally
meet your mom and dad,

00:51.138 --> 00:53.314
even if it is
a few years overdue.

00:53.314 --> 00:56.012
I'm just warning you that
they're gonna have some thoughts

00:56.012 --> 00:59.885
on the color of the baby's room,
the size of the crib,

00:59.885 --> 01:02.236
and schools and...

01:02.236 --> 01:04.238
- You get the picture, right?
- Yeah.

01:04.238 --> 01:06.283
I don't want you to be put off.

01:06.283 --> 01:07.719
Sounds like
we're gonna have some good

01:07.719 --> 01:09.112
family conversation tonight.

01:09.112 --> 01:10.766
It's gonna be fun.

01:10.766 --> 01:12.768
I'm glad one of us thinks so.

01:12.768 --> 01:14.813
If they start
pitching baby names,

01:14.813 --> 01:18.382
- can you just smile and nod?
- Can you?

01:18.382 --> 01:20.689
Hmm.

02:14.612 --> 02:16.571
Hey,
you switching up your stance

02:16.571 --> 02:18.486
- or something?
- No.

02:18.486 --> 02:20.270
Just not getting great sleep,
man. It's not a big deal.

02:20.270 --> 02:22.707
- I'm fine.
- Hey, you can talk to me
if something's up.

02:22.707 --> 02:25.188
No shut-eye is usually
a symptom, not the cause.

02:27.103 --> 02:29.497
Bonnie's been traveling
a lot more for work lately.

02:29.497 --> 02:31.063
She's hitting all
these VIP sporting events,

02:31.063 --> 02:32.456
couldn't make it back

02:32.456 --> 02:34.066
for our anniversary.

02:34.066 --> 02:35.546
We've been apart a lot.
I'm not gonna lie.

02:35.546 --> 02:37.505
It's been hard.
I just miss my wife.

02:37.505 --> 02:40.029
Damn. I'm sorry. I wish there
was something I could help with.

02:42.249 --> 02:44.599
- Officer Luca?
- Yeah.

02:44.599 --> 02:46.731
- Dominique Luca?
- Yeah.

02:46.731 --> 02:48.211
- Morning.
- Hey.

02:48.211 --> 02:49.778
Sorry to interrupt.

02:49.778 --> 02:51.954
Um, my name is Eva Durant.

02:51.954 --> 02:55.218
- Can I talk to you?
- Uh, now's not really great.

02:55.218 --> 02:57.568
Look, I can ping somebody
if you're working patrol for us.

02:57.568 --> 02:59.309
Oh, actually,
it's a personal matter.

02:59.309 --> 03:01.224
Is there somewhere we can talk?

03:01.224 --> 03:04.314
Well, my SWAT teammates are
family, so you can say whatever

03:04.314 --> 03:06.534
you needed to say. Well...

03:10.538 --> 03:12.235
I'm your sister.

03:12.235 --> 03:14.281
What are you talking about?

03:14.281 --> 03:16.544
I-I don't have
a sister.

03:16.544 --> 03:18.372
- I'm afraid you do.
- Look, I don't know

03:18.372 --> 03:20.287
what you're playing at,
- but there's no way.
- All right.

03:20.287 --> 03:21.766
Let-let me back up.

03:21.766 --> 03:23.942
Long story short,
I lost my mom recently.

03:23.942 --> 03:26.249
- Sorry for your loss.
- Yeah.

03:26.249 --> 03:27.859
Condolences.

03:27.859 --> 03:30.601
Uh, but the point is, I've never
known who my father was.

03:30.601 --> 03:32.647
She wouldn't tell me,
but right before she died,

03:32.647 --> 03:34.301
she changed her mind.

03:34.301 --> 03:37.086
She confessed to me
that she had an affair

03:37.086 --> 03:38.740
years ago when she worked

03:38.740 --> 03:41.482
out of Hollenbeck
with a guy named Carl Luca.

03:41.482 --> 03:44.180
You can look her up--
Detective Sofia Durant.

03:44.180 --> 03:46.400
No.

03:46.400 --> 03:49.229
No way my dad would've cheated
- on my mom.
- Okay.

03:49.229 --> 03:51.231
I know I'm blindsiding you here.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.971
And as far as I know,

03:52.971 --> 03:55.278
your dad--
he doesn't know about me.

03:55.278 --> 03:56.975
He never knew

03:56.975 --> 03:58.803
that my mom was
carrying his baby.

03:58.803 --> 04:00.805
Just... what exactly
do you want from me?

04:00.805 --> 04:04.418
I just... wanted
to meet my half brother...

04:04.418 --> 04:06.376
...and talk.

04:06.376 --> 04:07.986
You know, I got to admit,

04:07.986 --> 04:10.641
it's pretty cool,
the both of us being LAPD,

04:10.641 --> 04:12.556
carrying on
our parents' legacies.

04:12.556 --> 04:14.079
Stop. Just-just stop, okay?

04:14.079 --> 04:15.994
I don't want
to call your mom

04:15.994 --> 04:18.083
a liar, especially because

04:18.083 --> 04:19.650
she just died, but

04:19.650 --> 04:22.174
you got it all wrong,
you understand me?

04:26.135 --> 04:27.832
Look, where do you work out of?

04:27.832 --> 04:30.313
Maybe I can get him
to touch base with you later.

04:30.313 --> 04:32.794
I'm mid-watch
out of 27th Division.

04:32.794 --> 04:36.188
And, look, I-I get
that this isn't something

04:36.188 --> 04:38.060
he wants to believe.

04:38.060 --> 04:41.106
But it's the truth.

04:48.853 --> 04:50.333
Burrows.

04:50.333 --> 04:52.161
Hate to say it, but

04:52.161 --> 04:53.641
Robbery Homicide's gonna need
SWAT's help on this one.

04:53.641 --> 04:55.077
Copy that. What's
the story so far?

04:55.077 --> 04:58.167
Firebombing and a shooting.

04:58.167 --> 05:00.822
Suspect hit the phone bank here
with two Molotov cocktails.

05:00.822 --> 05:02.911
Then, when workers were fleeing
the fire, he started

05:02.911 --> 05:05.217
picking 'em off.
Some messed up stuff, right?

05:05.217 --> 05:06.871
What kind of toll
are we looking at?

05:06.871 --> 05:09.309
Three dead, 11 wounded,
including the security guard.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.441
He shot back, and even
though he didn't end up

05:11.441 --> 05:13.878
hitting the guy, he did manage
to force the shooter

05:13.878 --> 05:15.706
back into his getaway car.

05:15.706 --> 05:17.055
So it could've been even worse?

05:17.055 --> 05:18.492
Yeah, still might be.

05:18.492 --> 05:20.102
You think
this is the start of something?

05:20.102 --> 05:22.844
More like a continuation.
This was the second attack.

05:22.844 --> 05:24.715
A fulfillment center
in Toluca Lake

05:24.715 --> 05:26.848
got hit about an hour
before this went down.

05:26.848 --> 05:28.284
Sheriff's Department responded.

05:28.284 --> 05:29.459
Shooter was gone
by the time they got there.

05:29.459 --> 05:30.765
In and out,
hit and run,

05:30.765 --> 05:32.767
- just like this one?
- Yeah.

05:32.767 --> 05:34.334
- There, uh, security footage?
- Yeah.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.726
We're canvassing it now,
as well as spent shells

05:35.726 --> 05:37.380
- for ballistics.
- So, if there's an arsonist

05:37.380 --> 05:38.599
spree shooter on the loose,
there's a good chance

05:38.599 --> 05:39.948
he's prepping for his next hit.

05:39.948 --> 05:41.819
That's what we're afraid of,

05:41.819 --> 05:43.604
and that's why I called SWAT.

05:43.604 --> 05:45.606
All right, we'll work with RHD
to figure out

05:45.606 --> 05:47.608
who this guy is
and where he's going next,

05:47.608 --> 05:50.698
and when he strikes...
we'll stop him.

06:34.916 --> 06:36.265
What do you got, Street?

06:36.265 --> 06:37.962
We compared witness statements
from both shootings.

06:37.962 --> 06:41.879
They reported seeing the same
vehicle-- blue Chevy Impala.

06:41.879 --> 06:43.446
It was reported stolen

06:43.446 --> 06:44.969
yesterday in North Hollywood.
I already put out a BOLO,

06:44.969 --> 06:47.319
so we'll know if it hits traffic
cams or turns up anywhere.

06:47.319 --> 06:49.365
Wonder if the shooter
will keep the ride

06:49.365 --> 06:51.367
now that we got cops
all over the city on this.

06:51.367 --> 06:52.760
Well, if he keeps it,
we'll find him.

06:52.760 --> 06:54.544
Now, Hondo and Tan
are looking into connections

06:54.544 --> 06:56.241
between the two businesses
that got hit,

06:56.241 --> 06:58.243
hoping we can figure out
why they were targeted.

06:58.243 --> 06:59.897
All right, good.

06:59.897 --> 07:01.333
Deacon and Cabrera are
headed over to the hospital

07:01.333 --> 07:02.726
to talk to the wounded
security guard.

07:02.726 --> 07:04.380
Maybe he can shed
some light on this.

07:04.380 --> 07:06.338
Hey, check on ballistics.

07:06.338 --> 07:07.949
Maybe the shells left behind
can give us something.

07:07.949 --> 07:10.038
Roger that, Commander.

07:10.038 --> 07:11.692
I want this sick bastard stopped.

07:14.825 --> 07:16.740
Oh, thank you.
Mm-hmm.

07:16.740 --> 07:18.786
- Mr. Ellis?
- Mm-hmm.

07:18.786 --> 07:20.570
I'm Sergeant Kay,
this is Officer Cabrera.

07:20.570 --> 07:22.572
Thanks for talking to us.

07:22.572 --> 07:24.574
Uh-huh, I know how important
time is for you guys, so...

07:24.574 --> 07:26.228
Anything you've got
on our shooter--

07:26.228 --> 07:28.273
it'd be a big help.

07:28.273 --> 07:31.755
Um... shooter had on a hoodie,
but I saw his face.

07:31.755 --> 07:35.498
Kid was young, couldn't
have been more than 18,

07:35.498 --> 07:37.587
19, tops.

07:37.587 --> 07:39.589
Was there anyone else
in the car? Any accomplices?

07:39.589 --> 07:41.243
I tried to see but
couldn't make anything out.

07:41.243 --> 07:43.506
Tinted windows.

07:43.506 --> 07:45.290
You said you got a look
at the shooter's face.

07:45.290 --> 07:46.596
- Mm-hmm.
- Can you describe him?

07:46.596 --> 07:49.730
Well, Hispanic kid,
if that helps.

07:49.730 --> 07:52.646
Oh, did he say anything
that might hint at a motive?

07:52.646 --> 07:55.126
If he did, I didn't hear it.

07:55.126 --> 07:56.954
Were there any threats made
at the business beforehand?

07:56.954 --> 08:01.481
Mm, nothing. I would have heard
about something like that.

08:06.834 --> 08:09.706
- Hey, you seen Hondo?
- Motor pool, I think.

08:09.706 --> 08:12.187
All right. Hey, man,
you all right?

08:12.187 --> 08:13.884
Just want to make sure
you're okay.

08:13.884 --> 08:15.538
What, okay with this lady
coming out of nowhere,

08:15.538 --> 08:17.279
saying that my dad
cheated on my mom?

08:17.279 --> 08:19.542
That he had an affair
with some coworker?

08:19.542 --> 08:22.502
Sofia Durant. That's what
she said her mother's name was.

08:22.502 --> 08:23.894
If you want, I can
look up her PD file.

08:23.894 --> 08:25.548
No, absolutely not.

08:25.548 --> 08:28.029
I'm not gonna play into this
'cause I don't believe her.

08:28.029 --> 08:30.335
Okay, my dad is a good guy.

08:30.335 --> 08:32.381
He wouldn't have done
what she's saying.

08:32.381 --> 08:34.862
Listen, I don't
think she came by

08:34.862 --> 08:36.733
just to break up
the Luca family.

08:36.733 --> 08:38.518
Yeah, but that's
what she's doing.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.607
Okay, my parents are old,
they finally got

08:40.607 --> 08:44.306
to a place where
they just seem... settled.

08:44.306 --> 08:46.917
What's something like this
going to do to them?

08:46.917 --> 08:48.919
I get it, man. It's-it's
a lot to process,

08:48.919 --> 08:50.965
but what if you just
sat down and talked with her?

08:50.965 --> 08:52.836
That's all Eva wants
right now.

08:52.836 --> 08:55.796
After all, if she
is your sister...

09:02.411 --> 09:05.370
Hey, Hondo, I just
talked to Deac.

09:05.370 --> 09:06.807
The wounded guard
from the phone bank didn't know

09:06.807 --> 09:08.286
of any threats to the company
or its employees.

09:08.286 --> 09:10.027
Yeah, I heard
pretty much the same thing

09:10.027 --> 09:11.812
from Detective Burrows. Whatever
the connection is between

09:11.812 --> 09:13.509
the two targets this morning,
we still haven't found it.

09:13.509 --> 09:15.685
Which means
the attacks could be random.

09:15.685 --> 09:17.339
Making this even more dangerous
and unpredictable

09:17.339 --> 09:19.123
than we thought.
Our shooter could pop off

09:19.123 --> 09:20.864
anywhere, any time.

09:20.864 --> 09:22.387
Still waiting
on the ballistics report.

09:22.387 --> 09:23.780
Hopefully it tells us something
when it comes in.

09:23.780 --> 09:25.216
Yeah.

09:25.216 --> 09:27.392
- What?
- Everything all right?

09:27.392 --> 09:29.264
Nichelle's father is
inside asking for me.

09:29.264 --> 09:31.788
- Were you expecting him?
- No. No. I was supposed

09:31.788 --> 09:33.398
to meet him for the first time
tonight at dinner.

09:33.398 --> 09:35.662
I wonder why
he'd come by here first.

09:35.662 --> 09:38.839
Well, only one way to find out.

09:38.839 --> 09:40.928
Yeah.

09:50.024 --> 09:52.635
Mr. Carmichael,
this is a surprise.

09:52.635 --> 09:55.595
- Nice to finally meet you.
- I know this is
a little preemptive.

09:55.595 --> 09:57.901
- I hope you don't mind.
- No.

09:57.901 --> 10:00.774
I was admiring the history here.
You don't see many faces

10:00.774 --> 10:03.472
like ours
until the last few decades, hmm?

10:03.472 --> 10:05.474
- Well, change takes time, sir.
- Mm.

10:05.474 --> 10:07.476
And two parties giving
- each other a chance.
- Mm.

10:07.476 --> 10:09.391
But I like to think
that things are improving.

10:09.391 --> 10:11.001
Well, let's hope
we're moving back

10:11.001 --> 10:12.742
to a better L.A.
than the one we left.

10:12.742 --> 10:15.049
My wife and I really
enjoyed New York.

10:15.049 --> 10:17.442
It took a lot
to pull me away from Cornell.

10:17.442 --> 10:19.009
Well, I know
Nichelle is so happy

10:19.009 --> 10:20.707
that you're back.

10:20.707 --> 10:23.013
And I'm sure your grandchild
is worth relocating for.

10:23.013 --> 10:24.449
Listen...
Daniel,

10:24.449 --> 10:26.451
the reason I came down here is

10:26.451 --> 10:28.410
to cut through the theatrics
and get to brass tacks.

10:28.410 --> 10:31.282
My wife and I are looking
forward to dinner tonight.

10:31.282 --> 10:35.896
But, man to man,
do me the courtesy

10:35.896 --> 10:39.247
of not mistaking our presence
as approval.

10:39.247 --> 10:44.469
May I ask what exactly do I need
to do to win you over?

10:44.469 --> 10:46.080
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.256
Well, sir, I never thought
that it would be.

10:48.256 --> 10:50.171
I just learned from my father
to boil it down

10:50.171 --> 10:53.130
to where everyone knows
what the real problem is.

10:54.001 --> 10:56.351
Hondo, ballistics just came back
on our shooters.

10:56.351 --> 10:58.570
- Sorry to interrupt.
- Uh,

10:58.570 --> 11:00.703
it's okay. I, uh...
I've said my piece.

11:00.703 --> 11:02.618
I'll let you get back to work.

11:04.141 --> 11:06.187
Well, I'll see you tonight,
Mr. Carmichael.

11:06.187 --> 11:08.189
- Mm-hmm.
- Nice of you to stop by.

11:08.189 --> 11:09.712
I know.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.239
Okay, what was that all about?

11:15.239 --> 11:18.242
That was Nichelle's father.

11:18.242 --> 11:20.331
He just came to fire a shot
across the bow

11:20.331 --> 11:21.811
of Nichelle
and my relationship.

11:21.811 --> 11:23.465
Well, you ask me,

11:23.465 --> 11:25.293
just seems like a guy
with a bug up his ass.

11:25.293 --> 11:26.947
Nichelle warned me that he might
feel some type of way

11:26.947 --> 11:28.905
about her coming down
from Baldwin Hills

11:28.905 --> 11:30.341
and settling in my hood.

11:30.341 --> 11:32.692
Does that make you feel
a certain way?

11:32.692 --> 11:35.216
Just that it's gonna be real
interesting tonight at dinner.

11:35.216 --> 11:37.305
Come on.

11:40.525 --> 11:42.049
Ammo from the Toluca Lake attack

11:42.049 --> 11:44.138
was a three and a half inch
buckshot shell.

11:44.138 --> 11:45.835
In Van Nuys, it was a two
and three quarter shotgun slug.

11:45.835 --> 11:48.620
Different ammo, and
to fire them, different guns.

11:48.620 --> 11:50.361
Plus, the Toluca Lake shooter
wore green.

11:50.361 --> 11:52.407
Witnesses from Van Nuys
reported a gray hoodie.

11:52.407 --> 11:53.800
So there's more
than one shooter?

11:54.888 --> 11:56.890
The BOLO on the blue Impala from
this morning just got a hit.

11:56.890 --> 11:58.761
Turned up in a housing project
in East L.A.,

11:58.761 --> 12:01.198
two blocks south of ELAC.

12:01.198 --> 12:03.287
That's a rough part of town. Do
we know who controls the block?

12:03.287 --> 12:04.724
No. I just
talked to GND.

12:04.724 --> 12:05.942
That block's
in a constant turf battle.

12:05.942 --> 12:07.596
Main set's
always changing.

12:07.596 --> 12:09.076
So we don't know who
we might be dealing with?

12:09.076 --> 12:10.425
But we do know
the shooter's car is there.

12:10.425 --> 12:11.948
That's our best lead yet.

12:11.948 --> 12:13.863
Grab the squad.
It's worth a recon.

12:29.139 --> 12:31.011
Street, you're with me
on the car.

12:31.011 --> 12:32.708
Luca, Tan, Cabrera,

12:32.708 --> 12:34.623
check out the building,
watch our six.

12:34.623 --> 12:36.973
Stay liquid.

12:37.974 --> 12:39.628
Hey, you good?

12:39.628 --> 12:41.761
Yeah, of course.

12:49.638 --> 12:52.249
Okay, lookouts are calling
their friends.

12:56.688 --> 12:59.126
Definitely the right ride.

12:59.126 --> 13:01.128
Where'd our shooters go?
Well, they could be

13:01.128 --> 13:03.826
anywhere here, or they could be
miles away by now.

13:03.826 --> 13:05.567
Excuse me?!

13:05.567 --> 13:07.569
Anyone know
who dumped this car here?

13:12.792 --> 13:16.099
30-David to Command.
No sign of the suspects.

13:16.099 --> 13:17.840
Contact Detective Burrows
at RHD.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.233
Have them roll out
to our location

13:19.233 --> 13:21.322
and process a vehicle.

13:28.068 --> 13:29.504
Hey, you know
who runs this block?

13:29.504 --> 13:33.160
Yeah. Not you guys.

13:33.160 --> 13:35.815
Tough neighborhood.
You come from here,

13:35.815 --> 13:38.034
you might not
stand a chance.

13:41.733 --> 13:44.432
Hey, there's tagging
all over this place.

13:44.432 --> 13:46.738
This is Third Street Bravos'
territory.

13:46.738 --> 13:48.262
And if you take into account
that witnesses said

13:48.262 --> 13:49.872
the shooters were
in their teens...

13:49.872 --> 13:51.395
I'm thinking the attacks
today could be

13:51.395 --> 13:52.919
gang initiation killings.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.616
Yeah, who knows
how many recruits are involved,

13:54.616 --> 13:56.313
or how many initiations
we could be looking at.

13:56.313 --> 13:57.793
Nothing around here happens

13:57.793 --> 13:59.316
without
the shot-caller's approval.

13:59.316 --> 14:00.752
We're not trying to rile
this place up, right?

14:00.752 --> 14:03.581
No. Let's head back to HQ.

14:03.581 --> 14:05.366
We'll work with GND,
see if we can find out

14:05.366 --> 14:07.368
who the shot-caller is
and where we can find him.

14:07.368 --> 14:09.500
Sounds like a plan. I doubt
anyone here's gonna talk to us.

14:11.372 --> 14:13.287
<i>!¡Sinverguüenza!</i>

14:13.287 --> 14:14.549
<i>!¡Rata!</i> Stop right there!

14:14.549 --> 14:15.985
Back it up.

14:15.985 --> 14:17.508
- <i>Vendida gringa.</i> Huh?
- Stay. Stay back.

14:17.508 --> 14:18.858
<i>!¡Lárgate!</i> STREET:
Maybe she'll talk to us.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.337
Looks like she got a lot to say.

14:20.337 --> 14:22.557
She doesn't seem to like
female cops very much.

14:22.557 --> 14:25.038
It's not that.
She doesn't like me.

14:25.038 --> 14:26.604
<i>!¡Lárgate!</i> She's my cousin.

14:30.043 --> 14:31.522
You know what? That's it!

14:31.522 --> 14:32.959
- Hey, back up! Back up!
- Give me your hand.

14:32.959 --> 14:33.960
Hey, we don't have the numbers
for crowd control

14:33.960 --> 14:35.439
if this pops off. No.

14:35.439 --> 14:37.093
We don't. Let's get out
of here. Let's move!

14:37.093 --> 14:38.703
- Back up. Stay back!
- Let's go.

14:38.703 --> 14:41.315
- Let's go. Right now.
- Back up. Stay back. Stay back!

14:42.664 --> 14:45.667
Hey, get in. Now!

15:02.205 --> 15:04.164
Cabrera, you all right?

15:04.164 --> 15:06.818
I take it things aren't great
between you and your cousin.

15:06.818 --> 15:08.820
What's the story there?

15:08.820 --> 15:12.085
Long and short of it, ten years
ago, when Raquel was a teenager,

15:12.085 --> 15:14.087
she was going down a bad path.

15:14.087 --> 15:15.697
She got involved
with the wrong people.

15:15.697 --> 15:18.787
She was about to join a gang.

15:18.787 --> 15:22.573
Since I was just out of
the Academy, her mom came to me.

15:22.573 --> 15:24.967
She knew Raquel
had done some stuff.

15:24.967 --> 15:26.926
Hold-ups, theft, B's.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.102
So her mom asked you
to turn Raquel in?

15:29.102 --> 15:31.278
She went to jail for a year.

15:31.278 --> 15:33.193
But it kept her
from joining a gang.

15:33.193 --> 15:35.456
And I became the family rat
in the process.

15:35.456 --> 15:36.718
Does she know
her mother asked you to do it?

15:36.718 --> 15:40.417
No. As a cop, I felt

15:40.417 --> 15:42.115
it was a burden
I could bear alone,

15:42.115 --> 15:44.900
her hate focused on me,
better than on her mom.

15:44.900 --> 15:47.468
Damn. That's a lot
to put on your shoulders.

15:47.468 --> 15:49.035
But, for what
it's worth,

15:49.035 --> 15:50.514
I think that's huge.

15:51.863 --> 15:53.822
Hey, if Raquel still lives
in the neighborhood,

15:53.822 --> 15:55.955
you think she's got some info

15:55.955 --> 15:58.348
on the Third Street Bravos?

15:58.348 --> 16:00.046
She might.

16:00.046 --> 16:03.005
- Worth a shot.
- Okay.

16:04.964 --> 16:07.053
- Yo.
- Hey.

16:07.053 --> 16:08.880
Street said Nichelle's dad
came by earlier.

16:08.880 --> 16:10.447
Everything good?

16:10.447 --> 16:11.883
Hmm.

16:11.883 --> 16:13.276
Ah, Deac, put it this way.

16:13.276 --> 16:15.148
Uh, he is not my biggest fan.

16:15.148 --> 16:16.758
I wouldn't let that
get to you.

16:16.758 --> 16:20.022
Annie's parents aren't
my biggest fan, either.

16:20.022 --> 16:22.459
- Never have been.
- That right there is a surprise.

16:22.459 --> 16:24.331
I thought
they'd be all about you.

16:24.331 --> 16:27.160
Are you kidding? Their pride
and joy is in law school,

16:27.160 --> 16:29.249
on her way to becoming a lawyer

16:29.249 --> 16:31.033
or a judge
or a senator.

16:31.033 --> 16:33.035
She gets pregnant, drops out.

16:33.035 --> 16:35.081
- Who do you think they blame?
- Okay.

16:35.081 --> 16:37.213
But they still come around,
especially for the kids.

16:37.213 --> 16:38.606
How you making that work?

16:38.606 --> 16:40.042
You really want to know?

16:40.042 --> 16:42.044
It sounds silly, but it works.

16:42.044 --> 16:45.482
Whenever they come
into town, I just...

16:45.482 --> 16:48.790
I imagine myself
as a bank hostage.

16:48.790 --> 16:50.487
I just do what I'm told.

16:50.487 --> 16:52.402
I do nothing to upset them
because I know I only have

16:52.402 --> 16:54.361
to survive until they leave.

16:54.361 --> 16:56.058
Damn, Deac. I never thought I'd
have to put myself in the shoes

16:56.058 --> 16:58.321
of a hostage
- to get through a dinner.
- No, it works.

16:58.321 --> 17:01.194
And then, when they're gone,
I... I tell Annie I love her,

17:01.194 --> 17:04.719
hug my kids,
because that's what's important.

17:05.763 --> 17:07.026
You got to ask yourself--

17:07.026 --> 17:10.159
what's worse?
Keeping things status quo

17:10.159 --> 17:12.031
for Nichelle
and your future kid,

17:12.031 --> 17:14.642
or confronting her parents
head-on, and spoiling everything

17:14.642 --> 17:16.209
because
your pride can't take it?

17:16.209 --> 17:19.081
Hmm. That's all
I'm thinking about right now.

17:19.081 --> 17:21.083
Ah, do yourself a favor.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.085
Don't overthink it.

17:25.870 --> 17:28.395
Look, Raquel,
you know how this works.

17:28.395 --> 17:30.136
You help us out,
there's a chance

17:30.136 --> 17:31.528
we'll make the "assaulting
an officer" charge go away.

17:31.528 --> 17:34.488
Help you?
You mean snitch on someone.

17:34.488 --> 17:36.446
Hmm? Be a rat?

17:37.621 --> 17:39.580
Was it hard giving me up
years ago?

17:39.580 --> 17:41.234
I hope it was,
seeing as I'm family and all.

17:41.234 --> 17:43.453
Listen, you're in some
trouble right now.

17:43.453 --> 17:45.151
Whatever your personal
beef is, this is only

17:45.151 --> 17:46.717
gonna make things
worse for you.

17:46.717 --> 17:48.110
We think the Third Street
Bravos are behind

17:48.110 --> 17:49.459
the firebombings
and shootings earlier today.

17:49.459 --> 17:51.113
We both know

17:51.113 --> 17:53.724
word gets around in the project,
so you know what's up.

17:53.724 --> 17:56.640
Okay. Yeah, I heard about
what popped off today. So what?

17:56.640 --> 17:59.730
So the crimes have all the
hallmarks of gang initiations.

17:59.730 --> 18:01.993
- Do you know who's behind them?
- Ain't the Bravos.

18:01.993 --> 18:04.083
Okay, no offense, but how about
you give us the Bravos'

18:04.083 --> 18:06.041
shot-caller, and we can, uh,
confirm that for ourselves?

18:06.041 --> 18:08.087
You don't need to talk to him.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.524
Like you said, word gets around.

18:10.524 --> 18:12.047
Bravo homeboys ain't the ones
popping off.

18:12.047 --> 18:13.309
Then why did we find
the shooters' getaway car

18:13.309 --> 18:15.355
- in Bravos territory?
- Because

18:15.355 --> 18:17.531
the guy behind this wanted you
to find it there.

18:17.531 --> 18:20.490
Had his guys dump it on
our block so LAPD would roll in,

18:20.490 --> 18:23.014
maybe crack a few heads,
slap some cuffs on.

18:23.014 --> 18:25.104
Mm. Like these right here.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.758
So you do know
- who's behind this?
- I ain't a rat.

18:27.758 --> 18:30.065
Even if this guy is bringing
heat to your neighborhood,

18:30.065 --> 18:32.459
trying to implicate the Bravos?
You're okay with that?

18:35.592 --> 18:38.465
We're not asking you
to be a rat, Raquel.

18:38.465 --> 18:40.467
We're just asking you
to stand up for your hood.

18:40.467 --> 18:42.817
And keep who knows
how many more innocent people

18:42.817 --> 18:44.819
from getting killed.

18:44.819 --> 18:47.474
Look, just give us a name?

18:47.474 --> 18:49.911
Raquel, do the right thing.

18:55.351 --> 18:57.658
There's a banger-- Felipe Calvo.

18:57.658 --> 18:59.094
He's real dangerous, all right?

18:59.094 --> 19:00.878
One of the craziest fools
I ever heard of.

19:00.878 --> 19:02.228
Got kicked out
of the Bravos last month.

19:02.228 --> 19:03.751
Got kicked out? Why?'Cause that fool

19:03.751 --> 19:05.274
wanted to kill homies
that left the gang.

19:05.274 --> 19:07.276
So this Felipe Calvo

19:07.276 --> 19:09.713
- guy's into retribution?
- Word.

19:09.713 --> 19:11.498
But Bravos ain't about that.

19:11.498 --> 19:14.196
If you can't handle the life,
you can walk.

19:14.196 --> 19:16.633
I know, 'cause my boyfriend
was in the game.

19:16.633 --> 19:18.157
So Felipe gets kicked out
of the Bravos.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.984
So now, he's looking
to start his own gang.

19:19.984 --> 19:21.464
Makes sense,

19:21.464 --> 19:23.640
don't it?

19:25.599 --> 19:27.296
What do we have
on this jackass?

19:27.296 --> 19:31.082
Felipe Calvo-- he's got a list
of priors-- drug possession,

19:31.082 --> 19:32.997
armed robbery,
assault with a deadly weapon.

19:32.997 --> 19:34.390
He'd be the perfect decoy
if Raquel's trying

19:34.390 --> 19:36.131
to lead us down
the wrong road.

19:36.131 --> 19:38.002
I don't know. Cabrera thinks
that Raquel's on the level.

19:38.002 --> 19:40.222
Despite their history,
she says we can trust her.

19:40.222 --> 19:43.486
All right, then. Let's dig
into Calvo's known associates.

19:43.486 --> 19:45.445
Maybe we can find out
who his gang recruits are,

19:45.445 --> 19:47.011
see if we can ID
his shooters.

19:47.011 --> 19:49.449
Are we any closer to identifying
their next target?

19:49.449 --> 19:51.625
Deacon and Tan have a theory,
but they're still testing it.

19:51.625 --> 19:53.714
Well, I don't have to tell
you two that time's short.

19:53.714 --> 19:56.543
- Ticktock, boys.
- Yup.

20:08.511 --> 20:10.383
I brushed the glass
out of the seat for you.

20:12.428 --> 20:14.256
Yo, load up.

20:16.258 --> 20:18.652
Hey, you ready
- to do this?
- Hell yeah.

20:18.652 --> 20:21.437
But cops are probably
all over this by now.

20:21.437 --> 20:22.917
You know, maybe
it makes sense to wait

20:22.917 --> 20:25.093
till tomorrow
to let the heat die down.

20:25.093 --> 20:27.661
Nah. There's no waiting.
Only way out of this is

20:27.661 --> 20:30.272
you do your part
and be one of us.

20:30.272 --> 20:32.143
Okay.

20:46.070 --> 20:47.724
Hey, Commander,
if Felipe Calvo wants

20:47.724 --> 20:49.639
to take out former
Third Street Bravos,

20:49.639 --> 20:51.598
that could be the connection
between the two businesses

20:51.598 --> 20:53.600
that were hit this morning.
Turns out both of them employ

20:53.600 --> 20:56.167
reformed bangers,
including some ex Bravos.

20:56.167 --> 20:57.952
Well, how did we miss
- that connection earlier?
- Former gang

20:57.952 --> 21:00.476
affiliation isn't something
employers have to produce.

21:00.476 --> 21:02.261
We only found it
because we were looking for it.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.610
Okay, so now we have the link
between the two targets

21:03.610 --> 21:05.568
and how it ties
to Felipe's motive.

21:05.568 --> 21:07.744
Exactly. Which means he'll
likely target another business

21:07.744 --> 21:09.311
that employs former bangers.

21:09.311 --> 21:11.008
They're trying
to straighten out their lives,

21:11.008 --> 21:12.836
now they're being hunted down
because of it. Great.

21:12.836 --> 21:14.838
Yeah, I found 16 businesses
in the Valley

21:14.838 --> 21:16.318
that work with social workers
to employ ex-cons

21:16.318 --> 21:18.059
and former homeboys.

21:18.059 --> 21:19.713
Could be any of them
- at any moment.
- All right.

21:19.713 --> 21:21.367
I'll have patrol units sitting
on every one of 'em

21:21.367 --> 21:23.020
in case our shooters show up,
but in the meantime,

21:23.020 --> 21:24.805
we got to try
- to narrow this down.
- Hey.

21:24.805 --> 21:26.328
North Hollywood Division
just got a report

21:26.328 --> 21:28.243
of a stolen car
at a Vineland strip mall.

21:28.243 --> 21:29.766
Caught my eye because

21:29.766 --> 21:31.377
it's the same area where
the blue Impala got boosted.

21:31.377 --> 21:33.074
Somehow, I feel like
they're connected.

21:33.074 --> 21:34.858
Well, three potential businesses
they can target

21:34.858 --> 21:36.512
right around
where the car was stolen.

21:36.512 --> 21:39.210
Wait a second. Chucho's is
an active Lucky Boy hangout.

21:39.210 --> 21:41.343
There's no way former Bravos
would work there.

21:41.343 --> 21:43.476
That's right. They're rival
gangs. That's instant beef.

21:43.476 --> 21:45.695
And Boyd's is currently closed
for a renovation, which means

21:45.695 --> 21:47.218
Mike Blanca's
could be employing

21:47.218 --> 21:49.351
ex-Bravos
and be Felipe's next target.

21:49.351 --> 21:51.397
You sold me. Roll out.

22:17.771 --> 22:20.295
Plate matches our stolen car.

22:20.295 --> 22:21.644
30-David to Command.

22:21.644 --> 22:23.080
We've located
the stolen vehicle

22:23.080 --> 22:24.734
and a lone suspect.

22:24.734 --> 22:26.519
Come on. Let's go, let's go.
Move, move, move.

22:26.519 --> 22:28.303
LAPD! Hands where
we can see 'em!

22:28.303 --> 22:30.697
Get out of the car!
Do it now!

22:32.133 --> 22:33.395
Turn around
and walk backwards toward us.

22:35.049 --> 22:36.093
Lift up your shirt!

22:36.093 --> 22:38.792
Slowly.

22:38.792 --> 22:41.011
Down on your knees,

22:41.011 --> 22:43.057
hands behind your head
and clasp your fingers.

22:43.057 --> 22:45.364
All right, move in.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.801
Cabrera, go.

22:50.325 --> 22:55.156
30-David to Command, suspect
in custody. Show us Code Four.

23:14.131 --> 23:16.612
This doesn't need to be the end
of the world, Talia.

23:16.612 --> 23:19.354
You're only 17. You got
your whole life ahead of you.

23:19.354 --> 23:20.921
You help us find Felipe
and the other shooters,

23:20.921 --> 23:22.879
we can help you get your life
back on track.

23:22.879 --> 23:25.708
I don't know anyone
named Felipe.

23:25.708 --> 23:29.408
You might want to think harder.
Do that, and we can maybe work

23:29.408 --> 23:31.584
with the D.A.
to get your charges reduced.

23:31.584 --> 23:35.022
You could be looking at just
a few months in Los Padrinos,

23:35.022 --> 23:37.459
some community service.
But first,

23:37.459 --> 23:39.983
you need to tell us
the names of your friends

23:39.983 --> 23:41.985
and where we can find them.

23:42.986 --> 23:44.858
I don't know nothing.

23:44.858 --> 23:47.034
You know, I'm guessing

23:47.034 --> 23:49.776
Felipe coached you on what to
say in case you got scooped up?

23:49.776 --> 23:54.824
Talia, he's not your friend.

23:54.824 --> 23:57.131
And I know
it doesn't seem like it,

23:57.131 --> 23:59.133
but right now, we are.

23:59.133 --> 24:01.831
And we really want to help you,
but you got to help us, too.

24:03.833 --> 24:07.489
Talia, look at me.

24:07.489 --> 24:09.926
I think you want to help us,

24:09.926 --> 24:13.887
and in doing so,
you help yourself.

24:21.503 --> 24:23.505
I just want to be left alone.

24:33.994 --> 24:37.127
Hey, man. What's up? Talk to me.

24:37.127 --> 24:40.087
Hey, I looked up Eva's mom,
and things kind of line up.

24:40.087 --> 24:43.525
She worked with my dad,
and I know my folks were going

24:43.525 --> 24:45.875
through a long rough patch
right around then.

24:45.875 --> 24:47.311
But there's still part of you

24:47.311 --> 24:49.400
that feels it can't be true?

24:49.400 --> 24:51.185
'Cause this just throws
everything upside down

24:51.185 --> 24:56.277
between me and my dad,
- and between my parents.
- Yeah.

24:56.277 --> 24:58.801
This might blow up
some Luca history.

24:58.801 --> 25:01.804
But this is a girl who just
wants to know who her family is,

25:01.804 --> 25:04.764
who she's connected to.
Can you accept that part of it?

25:04.764 --> 25:07.027
It's just, this changes so much.
That's the problem.

25:07.027 --> 25:09.203
I know,
but it's not her fault.

25:09.203 --> 25:12.293
I doubt she wanted things
to shake out this way.

25:12.293 --> 25:14.904
I'm trying to get you to see
the positives here.

25:14.904 --> 25:16.340
Tell me what you
think those are.

25:16.340 --> 25:18.560
Well, for one,

25:18.560 --> 25:21.128
you got a sister now,
who you never knew before.

25:21.128 --> 25:23.434
You're not the type
of guy to freeze anyone out.

25:23.434 --> 25:25.959
You're too good
a dude for that.

25:25.959 --> 25:28.309
Plus, knowing the truth
is always worth it.

25:28.309 --> 25:30.224
Even if it hurts.

25:30.224 --> 25:32.356
Listen, man. I get
where you're coming from.

25:33.619 --> 25:35.621
But she wants to talk.

25:35.621 --> 25:38.232
I got no clue what I'm
supposed to say to her.

25:38.232 --> 25:41.061
Look, she just lost her mom.

25:41.061 --> 25:43.280
She probably feels
like an orphan.

25:43.280 --> 25:44.847
You don't have
to say anything to her.

25:44.847 --> 25:46.762
You just got
to be there to listen.

25:52.246 --> 25:53.769
Hondo?

25:53.769 --> 25:55.510
Just wanted
to check.

25:55.510 --> 25:56.946
Did Talia say anything?

25:56.946 --> 25:58.992
No, she's not helping
us or herself.

25:58.992 --> 26:00.733
Commander Hicks and Deacon
couldn't get anywhere with her.

26:00.733 --> 26:02.735
Mind if I try?

26:02.735 --> 26:03.997
I just want
to feel her out.

26:03.997 --> 26:05.738
I think I might be able to...

26:05.738 --> 26:07.174
get her to open up.

26:08.175 --> 26:09.568
Not criticizing
what they might've tried,

26:09.568 --> 26:10.830
it's just that I think

26:10.830 --> 26:12.483
I can connect with her.

26:12.483 --> 26:14.094
Because you got
ties to the hood.

26:15.312 --> 26:18.272
Guess I've tried to keep
that chapter of my life closed.

26:18.272 --> 26:20.796
Especially when it comes
to work life.

26:20.796 --> 26:23.364
I know how hard it is,
coming from my community,

26:23.364 --> 26:25.105
to be a cop, but I do

26:25.105 --> 26:27.324
believe it's possible to keep
one foot in each world.

26:27.324 --> 26:29.675
So if you think
your past will help,

26:29.675 --> 26:32.503
now's your time
to speak up.

26:41.251 --> 26:43.471
<i>¿Quieres agua?</i>

26:43.471 --> 26:45.734
<i>La traje para ti.</i>

26:45.734 --> 26:48.171
I don't speak Spanish really.

26:48.171 --> 26:50.652
What's your family think
about that?

26:50.652 --> 26:53.873
'Cause my mom used
to give me flack

26:53.873 --> 26:55.962
for my <i>pocha</i> Spanish.

26:57.703 --> 27:00.053
But I would think...

27:00.053 --> 27:02.055
I grew up here.

27:02.055 --> 27:04.840
Most of my friends only
spoke English in school.

27:04.840 --> 27:06.668
I went to Roosevelt,
you know that?

27:06.668 --> 27:08.452
Same as you.

27:08.452 --> 27:10.759
I'm East Los,
through and through.

27:10.759 --> 27:12.848
Tell you the truth,

27:12.848 --> 27:14.154
I feel like I'm looking
in a mirror.

27:14.154 --> 27:16.460
Man, we ain't the same.

27:16.460 --> 27:19.463
Maybe not, 'cause I got lucky.

27:19.463 --> 27:21.204
My parents did

27:21.204 --> 27:23.990
everything to keep me
away from the game.

27:23.990 --> 27:26.470
But most of my friends,
even family,

27:26.470 --> 27:28.995
they were in it,

27:28.995 --> 27:31.301
just like you are now.

27:31.301 --> 27:33.390
So now you think you know me?

27:33.390 --> 27:35.784
What my life is like?

27:35.784 --> 27:37.656
I looked you up.

27:37.656 --> 27:39.962
Your aunt's been raising you
since you were three.

27:39.962 --> 27:42.138
Your parents have been
out of the picture.

27:42.138 --> 27:43.792
Yeah, they're both doing time.

27:43.792 --> 27:47.143
You don't have to end up
like that too, Talia.

27:47.143 --> 27:49.102
Don't I?

27:49.102 --> 27:51.321
What else do I got?

27:51.321 --> 27:53.715
You still have choices.

27:53.715 --> 27:55.456
You can help us.

27:55.456 --> 27:57.458
And in return,
we'll help you.

27:57.458 --> 27:59.155
Nah. You playing me.

27:59.155 --> 28:01.288
You're probably not even
from the same hood or nothing.

28:01.288 --> 28:03.943
Just trying to get me to snitch.

28:03.943 --> 28:06.032
Straight up?

28:07.598 --> 28:09.644
I still got shame.

28:09.644 --> 28:12.691
I know what it's like
to get the stares.

28:12.691 --> 28:15.084
To see the way people
look at you when you say

28:15.084 --> 28:17.130
where you grew up,
where you live.

28:17.130 --> 28:19.219
You're just trying to join
a gang 'cause it's

28:19.219 --> 28:21.874
the one thing that'll make you
proud of where you're from.

28:21.874 --> 28:24.615
You rep a certain set,
you're a badass.

28:25.878 --> 28:28.837
But what's that gonna get
you inside a prison cell?

28:28.837 --> 28:30.796
I guess we'll find out.

28:30.796 --> 28:33.581
I know you're probably thinking
about what Felipe told you

28:33.581 --> 28:35.452
to say in case
this happened.

28:35.452 --> 28:37.672
And what your hood's
gonna say if you help us.

28:37.672 --> 28:39.587
That I'm a rat.

28:39.587 --> 28:41.502
What's worse than that?

28:41.502 --> 28:43.634
The world

28:43.634 --> 28:45.724
is way bigger than the hood.

28:47.116 --> 28:49.379
You can still escape it.

28:49.379 --> 28:51.207
Like I did.

28:51.207 --> 28:54.080
I know what you're
feeling, but...

28:54.080 --> 28:57.387
those are expectations of
people who ain't your friends.

28:59.781 --> 29:02.044
They don't want
what's best for you.

29:02.044 --> 29:04.003
I do.

29:05.004 --> 29:07.093
I promise you.

29:08.137 --> 29:10.531
What was supposed
to happen next?

29:14.187 --> 29:16.885
After I shot up
the coffee place...

29:20.454 --> 29:23.544
I was gonna text Felipe.

29:23.544 --> 29:26.547
Then he'd send me the location
for the next meetup.

29:29.768 --> 29:32.771
You're doing
the right thing, Talia.

29:35.730 --> 29:38.124
Cabrera sent a
confirmation text to Felipe

29:38.124 --> 29:39.821
from Talia's phone.
We're just waiting to see

29:39.821 --> 29:41.605
if he responds
with the meetup location.

29:41.605 --> 29:43.259
Did you get anything back on
the other shooters Talia ID'd?

29:43.259 --> 29:46.610
Yeah, Hector Reynoso
and Rafael Galindo.

29:46.610 --> 29:49.875
Both 18 and have juvie jackets.

29:49.875 --> 29:52.268
Reynoso's been suspended from
one school for dealing drugs.

29:52.268 --> 29:54.096
Another for assaulting
a teacher.

29:54.096 --> 29:55.445
Then there's Galindo.

29:55.445 --> 29:57.491
He's been expelled twice,
for fighting

29:57.491 --> 29:59.275
and for bringing a gun
to school.

29:59.275 --> 30:01.190
They're from the
same neighborhood?

30:01.190 --> 30:02.713
It all comes back
to community ties.

30:02.713 --> 30:05.847
Guys, Felipe responded
to Talia's text.

30:05.847 --> 30:08.850
He says, "El Topo in Pacoima,
15 minutes. See you then."

30:08.850 --> 30:11.679
It's a restaurant off
Balboa and Rayner.

30:11.679 --> 30:13.637
That's a busy part of town,
a lot of foot traffic.

30:13.637 --> 30:16.858
We're gonna need all available
units for a contain and callout.

30:16.858 --> 30:18.251
Let's roll.

30:18.251 --> 30:20.688
Honestly...

30:20.688 --> 30:22.995
didn't think she'd
go through with it.

30:22.995 --> 30:24.561
Yeah? Why not?

30:24.561 --> 30:26.172
Just thought she'd
chicken out or something.

30:26.172 --> 30:27.782
Took her damn time.

30:27.782 --> 30:29.436
Probably had to wind up
the nerve.

30:29.436 --> 30:31.264
So once she gets here,
we're done, yeah?

30:31.264 --> 30:32.831
We're laying low?

30:32.831 --> 30:34.136
Nah.

30:34.136 --> 30:35.834
We're just getting started.

30:35.834 --> 30:37.879
Well, what do you mean?

30:37.879 --> 30:39.533
We did our initiations.

30:39.533 --> 30:41.230
You did, but that doesn't
mean our work is done.

30:41.230 --> 30:43.842
There's a bakery on Lindall.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.887
A former Bravo
and his <i>jaina</i> work there.

30:45.887 --> 30:47.889
We're gonna hit
that place together.

30:47.889 --> 30:49.891
Show those <i>chavalos</i> what this
life is: blood in, blood out.

30:49.891 --> 30:51.458
That's the code.

30:51.458 --> 30:52.894
Four hits in one day?

30:52.894 --> 30:54.374
Isn't that a lot?

30:54.374 --> 30:56.071
Cops are gonna be on us.

30:56.071 --> 30:57.768
And what the hell's
taking Talia so long?

31:00.032 --> 31:02.251
Mike Blanca's.
How may I help you?

31:03.862 --> 31:06.299
Well, the café...
it's still in business.

31:06.299 --> 31:08.214
Told you she chickened out.

31:08.214 --> 31:10.390
Or she got scooped up already,
and the cops just played us.

31:10.390 --> 31:12.522
Let's bounce.

31:27.015 --> 31:29.061
Let's go!

31:41.812 --> 31:43.771
All right,
get the innocents to safety.

31:43.771 --> 31:45.207
Keep the shooters hemmed in.

31:45.207 --> 31:46.905
Go, go, go, go!

31:56.566 --> 31:57.872
Ma'am, ma'am, come this way!

31:57.872 --> 31:59.134
Get behind me.
We'll keep you safe.

31:59.134 --> 32:00.919
Move back with me, go!

32:09.362 --> 32:12.017
Deacon, Cabrera, take the three
side of the building. Move!

32:16.195 --> 32:18.414
Hey, come on, let's go!
Get behind me.

32:18.414 --> 32:21.243
Go, go, go. Follow me.

32:26.379 --> 32:28.511
Suspect heading west on foot!

32:28.511 --> 32:30.513
26-David, in foot pursuit!

32:32.907 --> 32:35.214
Hey! Hey, stick together!

32:47.095 --> 32:49.228
Give me your hands!

32:49.228 --> 32:52.405
25-David to D-Team,
first suspect in custody.

32:52.405 --> 32:55.060
Cover!

33:19.084 --> 33:21.260
30-David to D-Team,
second suspect

33:21.260 --> 33:22.913
in custody.

33:39.278 --> 33:41.454
- Stay down! I said stay down!
- Come on, man,
I didn't do anything, man.

33:41.454 --> 33:43.456
You're done.

33:43.456 --> 33:46.415
20-David to Command,
three suspects in custody.

33:46.415 --> 33:48.113
Code Four.

33:48.113 --> 33:50.376
Felipe Calvo,
you're under arrest.

33:57.339 --> 33:59.211
You're free to go now.

33:59.211 --> 34:01.213
The, uh, "assaulting
an officer" charge

34:01.213 --> 34:03.389
has been dropped. Thanks.

34:03.389 --> 34:06.044
I guess.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.742
For real, you ain't
even gonna say it?

34:08.742 --> 34:10.570
Thank you for your help.

34:10.570 --> 34:12.224
With your information,

34:12.224 --> 34:14.226
we got the shooters.

34:14.226 --> 34:16.054
You helped save
lives today.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.186
Nah, you ain't gonna
apologize for back then?

34:18.186 --> 34:20.319
Hmm?

34:20.319 --> 34:22.451
Ever?

34:22.451 --> 34:24.975
Raquel, I'm sorry

34:24.975 --> 34:27.108
I'm the reason you did time.

34:27.108 --> 34:29.371
I still believe
I did the right thing.

34:29.371 --> 34:31.591
And if I had to do it
over again, I would.

34:31.591 --> 34:34.115
It meant keeping you
out of the gang life.

34:34.115 --> 34:36.596
And I still have
my cousin,

34:36.596 --> 34:39.033
even if she doesn't see
eye to eye with me.

34:40.861 --> 34:43.081
You're a real G, you know that?

34:44.343 --> 34:46.736
Takes one to know one, I guess.

34:49.435 --> 34:51.219
These guys tripping
or what?

34:51.219 --> 34:53.830
No. They're your ride home.

34:58.008 --> 34:59.532
Hey, Raquel?

34:59.532 --> 35:01.664
One last thing.

35:01.664 --> 35:03.971
Can you tell your mom I say hey?

35:03.971 --> 35:06.321
Please?

35:15.809 --> 35:17.593
Eva, hey.

35:17.593 --> 35:19.639
Figured I'd roll over here

35:19.639 --> 35:21.293
after your shift.

35:21.293 --> 35:24.383
I'm sorry about earlier.

35:24.383 --> 35:27.995
I didn't really give you
a fair shake.

35:27.995 --> 35:30.563
You know, I guess
I kind of went into

35:30.563 --> 35:33.131
- full denial mode.
- You don't have to apologize.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.307
I know that
must've been tough

35:35.307 --> 35:37.787
coming from
a total stranger.

35:37.787 --> 35:40.050
Well, look,
we're not strangers.

35:40.050 --> 35:42.314
I looked your mom up.

35:42.314 --> 35:44.881
She was a hard charger.

35:44.881 --> 35:47.536
I mean real impressive.

35:47.536 --> 35:49.843
I'm sure she made the people
in her life really proud.

35:49.843 --> 35:51.671
Thank you.

35:51.671 --> 35:53.629
Losing her's
been tough.

35:53.629 --> 35:55.718
My captain wants me to
take off more time, but...

35:55.718 --> 35:57.459
Feels better to be on the job?

35:57.459 --> 35:59.461
With your teammates.

35:59.461 --> 36:02.334
'Cause they're like family, too.

36:04.597 --> 36:07.948
You want to go
somewhere and talk?

36:07.948 --> 36:09.689
Yeah.

36:09.689 --> 36:11.691
What are you thinking?

36:11.691 --> 36:13.606
Well, I got to eat.

36:13.606 --> 36:16.086
There's my food truck...

36:16.086 --> 36:18.176
But, you know, that's not
really a sit-down place.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.874
So I'm thinking...
Art's Deli?

36:20.874 --> 36:22.832
- I mean, it's on me.
- Sure.

36:22.832 --> 36:24.791
Art's is fine. Okay.

36:24.791 --> 36:27.185
I'll drive.
All right.

36:28.360 --> 36:30.231
What's the name
of your food truck?

36:30.231 --> 36:31.972
Guate-Mama.

36:31.972 --> 36:34.192
Hold up,
that place is yours?

36:34.192 --> 36:36.542
Yeah.
That place is legit.

36:38.326 --> 36:40.502
You know, I really
like 'malteco food.

36:40.502 --> 36:42.504
You surf, also?

36:42.504 --> 36:44.419
Where do you go?

36:44.419 --> 36:46.595
- Malibu. What about you?
- Redondo.

36:46.595 --> 36:48.031
Oof.

36:48.031 --> 36:50.382
We got a lot
to talk about.

36:53.515 --> 36:56.214
Hey, Cabrera, hold up a second.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.128
I want to say thank you.

36:58.128 --> 37:00.348
You came up huge
for us today.

37:00.348 --> 37:02.350
It's funny, I...

37:02.350 --> 37:04.961
turned my back on my
community to become a cop.

37:04.961 --> 37:07.007
Felt like I had
no other choice.

37:07.007 --> 37:09.314
Never imagined growing up where
I did could be an asset.

37:09.314 --> 37:11.664
When I first became a cop,
everybody told me

37:11.664 --> 37:14.014
it was Black... or blue.

37:14.014 --> 37:15.711
I had to pick.

37:15.711 --> 37:17.322
But when we lose track
of where we come from,

37:17.322 --> 37:19.976
the cop life
just becomes us...

37:19.976 --> 37:21.717
versus them.

37:21.717 --> 37:24.329
Your upbringing is nothing
to be ashamed of.

37:24.329 --> 37:26.809
Been thinking about that a
lot today, wondering just...

37:26.809 --> 37:29.290
how to embrace where
I come from again.

37:29.290 --> 37:31.379
Do you live around there?

37:31.379 --> 37:33.642
Nah, I moved out
as soon as I could.

37:33.642 --> 37:35.905
Got me a place
in the Valley.

37:35.905 --> 37:37.603
For what it's worth,
the more time

37:37.603 --> 37:39.169
you spend there,
it could do some good.

37:39.169 --> 37:41.215
For your community.

37:41.215 --> 37:43.435
And for you.

37:45.524 --> 37:46.481
Good job.

37:46.481 --> 37:48.396
Thank you.

37:54.489 --> 37:56.317
Okay.

37:56.317 --> 37:58.188
Everyone, help
yourselves, please.

37:58.188 --> 37:59.668
Oh, smells delicious.

37:59.668 --> 38:01.409
Thank you so much for cooking, Hondo.

38:01.409 --> 38:04.456
Oh, it was my pleasure. I'm glad
to finally get the chance

38:04.456 --> 38:07.372
- to meet you.
- Likewise.

38:07.372 --> 38:09.025
So, how's it feel
to be back home?

38:09.025 --> 38:11.854
Oh, we enjoyed
the East Coast.

38:11.854 --> 38:14.161
Called New York
our sanctuary

38:14.161 --> 38:17.338
for five years,
but, uh... we'll miss it.

38:17.338 --> 38:18.948
What was your favorite part
about living near Ithaca?

38:18.948 --> 38:20.428
For me, retiring.

38:20.428 --> 38:22.691
Don't get me wrong,
I loved

38:22.691 --> 38:25.259
the market out here,
but real estate's a hustle.

38:25.259 --> 38:28.480
I still have some good
contacts though.

38:28.480 --> 38:32.005
A really good listing agent
for when you two start looking

38:32.005 --> 38:34.964
after the baby's born.

38:34.964 --> 38:37.793
We haven't talked
about leaving this neighborhood.

38:37.793 --> 38:39.491
This is our home.

38:39.491 --> 38:42.363
Schools here got better
while you two were away.

38:42.363 --> 38:44.539
And they're still improving.

38:44.539 --> 38:46.802
You know how many kids
from South L.A.

38:46.802 --> 38:49.718
attended Cornell? None.

38:49.718 --> 38:52.155
Dad, I don't think the issue is

38:52.155 --> 38:53.548
where the neighborhood kids
come from.

38:53.548 --> 38:55.420
The issue might be Cornell.

38:55.420 --> 38:57.378
I'm just saying,
this is a big city

38:57.378 --> 38:58.988
with a lot
of different neighborhoods.

38:58.988 --> 39:01.556
If something
better is out there...

39:01.556 --> 39:03.776
Okay. Excuse me.

39:03.776 --> 39:06.431
Is this really
about the neighborhood?

39:06.431 --> 39:08.041
Or is it more about
who she's with?

39:08.041 --> 39:09.956
The company
she keeps.

39:12.306 --> 39:14.047
Mr. and Mrs. Carmichael,

39:14.047 --> 39:15.744
I'm sure you wanted
Nichelle to marry somebody

39:15.744 --> 39:18.747
with a different... pedigree.

39:18.747 --> 39:21.881
An unwed mother raising a baby
with a cop in South L.A.

39:21.881 --> 39:24.536
- probably wasn't your dream.
- But I am happy

39:24.536 --> 39:27.277
and fulfilled and...

39:27.277 --> 39:29.671
I'm certainly old enough
to make my own decisions.

39:29.671 --> 39:31.934
And this is
the decision I've made.

39:31.934 --> 39:33.936
That we've made.

39:33.936 --> 39:35.547
But there's a baby on the way.

39:35.547 --> 39:37.200
And I hope you two
are not putting

39:37.200 --> 39:38.506
your own agendas
ahead of hers.

39:38.506 --> 39:40.029
Okay, look.

39:40.029 --> 39:42.423
My parents' goals
for me were not my own.

39:42.423 --> 39:45.470
And your grandchild, she may
choose to do something in life

39:45.470 --> 39:47.254
that I'm not gonna
be too high on.

39:47.254 --> 39:49.648
But you best believe she's
gonna get all the love

39:49.648 --> 39:51.693
and support Nichelle
and I can give.

39:51.693 --> 39:53.782
Because bringing a child that
looks like us into the world,

39:53.782 --> 39:55.784
she's gonna need
a village behind her.

39:55.784 --> 39:57.482
Lord knows it took one
to raise me.

39:58.961 --> 40:01.311
Nichelle is everything
I dreamed of.

40:01.311 --> 40:03.313
Everything.

40:03.313 --> 40:05.141
And I am so excited about

40:05.141 --> 40:07.361
our life ahead
with our baby.

40:07.361 --> 40:09.276
And the two of you.

40:09.276 --> 40:10.712
If you want to be
a part of it.

40:12.322 --> 40:14.237
Doesn't sound
like you're trying too hard

40:14.237 --> 40:16.065
to win me over.

40:16.065 --> 40:17.676
All due respect,

40:17.676 --> 40:19.765
why do we have to?

40:19.765 --> 40:21.680
Oh.

40:22.637 --> 40:24.509
Okay, um...

40:24.509 --> 40:28.034
Wesley, why don't we go outside
and cool down a little?

40:28.034 --> 40:31.472
- Daniel needs to apologize first.
- Dad.

40:31.472 --> 40:33.518
Your pride is a thing.

40:33.518 --> 40:36.564
I deserve an apology.

40:36.564 --> 40:38.740
For what exactly?

40:40.481 --> 40:43.005
You're a real piece of work.

40:43.005 --> 40:45.312
I know.
