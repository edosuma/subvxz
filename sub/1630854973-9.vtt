WEBVTT

00:15.000 --> 00:18.083
Look, Howard.
I didn't ask you what I should name it.

00:18.083 --> 00:19.708
<i>Still loving "Rhinostradamus."</i>

00:19.708 --> 00:22.250
I just need to know what it eats,
what to feed it.

00:22.250 --> 00:23.625
<i>Oh, that's easy.</i>

00:23.625 --> 00:25.416
<i>Squirrels and small children, mostly.</i>

00:25.416 --> 00:26.375
Hey, what the...

00:26.375 --> 00:30.083
Uh, you know what happened to the last guy
who did that when I was on the phone?

00:30.083 --> 00:32.916
- No.
- Exactly. And nobody ever will.

00:32.916 --> 00:34.958
Industrial wood chippers
are handy that way.

00:34.958 --> 00:36.458
You and I need to talk.

00:36.458 --> 00:38.583
As in, you can go now.

00:38.583 --> 00:42.708
Is this about you taking acid
and destroying your own home? Classic!

00:42.708 --> 00:45.916
Quick question: did you really drive
a little sports car through your gate?

00:45.916 --> 00:47.458
Little sports car?

00:47.458 --> 00:50.208
It's called a De Tomaso Pantera.

00:50.208 --> 00:53.000
Which I believe is Italian
for "early midlife crisis."

00:53.000 --> 00:55.208
You should come over sometime
and check it out.

00:55.208 --> 00:57.958
Of course, you'll have to make your way
through the thousands of fans

00:57.958 --> 01:00.083
who camp out
in front of Graceland every day.

01:00.083 --> 01:03.750
You know, I almost named my house once,
and then I remembered,

01:04.333 --> 01:06.125
I'm not a fucking child.

01:07.250 --> 01:08.625
Ooh, burn!

01:09.541 --> 01:12.125
Well, that was fun. You can go now.

01:12.125 --> 01:13.833
I got your boy Leary back for you.

01:13.833 --> 01:16.666
Great.
You want a thank-you hug or something?

01:16.666 --> 01:18.291
Hey, Doyle! Come hug Elvis!

01:18.291 --> 01:19.333
<i>What? Really?</i>

01:19.333 --> 01:21.041
Shut the fuck up, Doyle.

01:21.541 --> 01:23.500
Leary mentioned something
that got me thinking.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.625
Oh, that right?

01:24.625 --> 01:26.458
Project Tupelo.

01:26.458 --> 01:27.708
"Dirty sandwich,"

01:27.708 --> 01:31.166
in case we're playing a new game
where we just say random words out loud.

01:31.166 --> 01:32.708
Project Tupelo.

01:33.250 --> 01:34.916
- You ever heard of it?
- Can't say I have.

01:34.916 --> 01:36.208
Which doesn't mean you haven't.

01:36.208 --> 01:40.166
Yeah, it's an idiom. Here's another one:
Don't let the door hit you on the way out.

01:40.166 --> 01:41.291
Look here.

01:41.291 --> 01:43.958
I think there's a ton of shit
that you're not telling me.

01:43.958 --> 01:44.875
Know that.

01:48.458 --> 01:50.000
- Hang back for a sec.
- What's up?

01:50.000 --> 01:52.041
You're good
at quietly stalking people, right?

01:52.041 --> 01:54.708
Allegedly stalking, to quote my lawyer.

01:54.708 --> 01:57.833
Keep an eye on Elvis for me.
Let me know if he gets up to anything.

01:57.833 --> 01:58.791
Will do.

02:00.666 --> 02:03.000
Yeah, not a chance, little guy.

02:04.083 --> 02:05.458
I'm so gonna die alone.

02:05.458 --> 02:08.333
You're seriously
just now figuring that out?

02:24.875 --> 02:26.875
- Nice setup, Howard.

02:26.875 --> 02:28.291
Fuck nice.

02:28.291 --> 02:30.750
This little baby is state-of-the-art.

02:30.750 --> 02:35.458
An entire database
that fits inside a single room.

02:35.458 --> 02:36.833
Say, mind if I give it a whirl?

02:36.833 --> 02:38.125
 Sorry.

02:38.125 --> 02:40.083
Walt and I are kind of busy.

02:40.083 --> 02:42.791
- Walt?
- Whoa! Where are my manners?

02:43.333 --> 02:46.625
Say hello to Walt Disney.

02:46.625 --> 02:49.291
- Well, a piece of him, anyway.
- What the hell?

02:49.291 --> 02:53.208
He's my best friend/
business partner/murder victim.

02:53.208 --> 02:54.875
Walt Disney wasn't murdered.

02:54.875 --> 02:55.833
Says you.

02:55.833 --> 03:00.708
But did you know Walt's dying words
were the name "Kurt Russell"?

03:00.708 --> 03:03.750
- You don't find that a little suspicious?
- Look here, if I say yes,

03:03.750 --> 03:05.375
can I borrow that computer a sec?

03:05.375 --> 03:07.375
I don't think
I'm supposed to let you do that.

03:07.375 --> 03:09.750
Well, Walt here says it's okay.

03:09.750 --> 03:11.958
Whoa, whoa, whoa! You can hear him?

03:11.958 --> 03:12.875
Why not?

03:12.875 --> 03:16.500
Now that actually makes
a ton of sense to me.

03:17.875 --> 03:19.125
Go right ahead.

03:19.125 --> 03:22.791
What else did Walt say? Did he tell you
about the robot assassins I made for him

03:22.791 --> 03:24.458
modeled after US presidents?

03:25.041 --> 03:28.250
Turns out he wanted
something more vanilla.

03:37.375 --> 03:38.875
What the hell is Sub-Level 7?

03:39.958 --> 03:42.208
Not what, where? Now...

03:43.375 --> 03:46.875
It's an ultra-classified area.

03:46.875 --> 03:49.208
- But shut the fuck up about it.
- Where is it?

03:49.208 --> 03:50.416
 Oh!

03:50.416 --> 03:53.208
No idea! Only the Commander knows.

03:54.458 --> 03:57.416
Wait, wait, wait!
Did Walt say anything about his murder?

03:57.416 --> 03:58.958
Just...

03:58.958 --> 04:00.541
that he wasn't murdered at all.

04:01.875 --> 04:05.208
Classic Walt! The king of misdirection.

04:09.666 --> 04:12.750
Guess it's up to me, then, right, Kurt?

04:20.333 --> 04:22.833
And the Scatter Cam is up.

04:22.833 --> 04:25.833
We got the front view, side view, and...

04:26.375 --> 04:27.916
That's supposed to be a rear view.

04:27.916 --> 04:30.583
Well, then, unfortunately, it is working.

04:30.583 --> 04:31.875
Scatter, you read?

04:32.458 --> 04:35.375
This is kids' stuff,
simple trail and tail, buddy.

04:42.250 --> 04:43.791
Oh, come on.

04:46.875 --> 04:48.333
<i>Ah</i>, <i>come on!</i>

04:51.375 --> 04:53.208
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

04:53.208 --> 04:55.833
Huh. I always imagined
his days would be busier.

05:01.458 --> 05:03.291
Oh come on. Come on. Come on.

05:04.708 --> 05:06.958
<i>Come on. Come on. Come on.</i>

05:12.250 --> 05:13.208
Got him.

05:15.500 --> 05:18.791
Bertie, how's my number-one person
in the world doing today?

05:20.000 --> 05:22.125
Buttering you up?
Come on now, that's nonsense.

05:23.291 --> 05:26.000
But yeah, I need a pretty big favor.

05:31.583 --> 05:32.916
Oh, is that a glory hole?

05:32.916 --> 05:35.541
Guess they're not just
for fun airport bathrooms anymore.

05:35.541 --> 05:37.750
- What are you doing here?
- Take it easy.

05:37.750 --> 05:39.166
Are you fucking stalking me?

05:39.166 --> 05:41.541
Hey, it's not stalking
if I don't think you're hot.

05:41.541 --> 05:42.833
To quote my lawyer.

05:43.458 --> 05:44.875
Who I do not think is very good.

05:44.875 --> 05:46.500
You still haven't answered my question.

05:46.500 --> 05:48.791
Look, it wasn't my idea.
The Commander asked me to.

05:48.791 --> 05:51.041
This right here. This right here.

05:51.041 --> 05:53.458
This is why I am done trusting you people.

05:53.458 --> 05:55.250
Are you also done

05:55.250 --> 05:56.875
being overly dramatic?

05:56.875 --> 06:00.583
I'm not going to rat you out, okay?
Now, what do you say we hit Sub-Level 7?

06:00.583 --> 06:02.291
This has nothing to do with you.

06:02.291 --> 06:05.541
Oh, come on. I've been dying
to see Sub-Level 7 for years.

06:05.541 --> 06:07.416
Not to mention,
I can maybe find out down there

06:07.416 --> 06:09.916
- if the Commander is secretly my dad.
- What?

06:09.916 --> 06:11.958
Well, I never met my real dad growing up,

06:11.958 --> 06:15.041
and the Commander got super weird
when I tried to seduce him.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.208
You do the math.

06:17.375 --> 06:18.875
Just don't get in my way.

06:20.666 --> 06:21.958
Oh, uh,

06:21.958 --> 06:23.333
based on personal experience,

06:23.333 --> 06:26.458
it's a very bad idea to look
directly into a glory hole like that.

06:27.125 --> 06:29.541
Jesus,
there are vein lines in there.

06:30.125 --> 06:32.333
Ooh, custom-fit hole, huh?

06:32.333 --> 06:35.000
Okay, well, yours still might work.
Give it a shot.

06:41.750 --> 06:43.416
Maybe it's all out of acid now?

06:43.416 --> 06:45.375
More like we're totally screwed now.

06:45.375 --> 06:47.583
So you're gonna give up? Just like that?

06:47.583 --> 06:49.541
Wow, you would make a terrible stalker.

06:49.541 --> 06:53.250
Unless there's an exact copy of the guy's
schlong lying around somewhere--

06:53.250 --> 06:54.666
- Actually...
- What?

06:54.666 --> 06:58.041
The Commander was once
in a three-way with Marlon Brando.

06:58.041 --> 07:00.500
What exactly made you think
I wanted to know that?

07:00.500 --> 07:02.458
Ever heard of Penelope Penis Caster?

07:02.458 --> 07:05.083
So let me get this straight.
This woman just runs around

07:05.083 --> 07:07.833
making plaster casts
of famous people's private parts?

07:07.833 --> 07:09.041
Among other things.

07:09.041 --> 07:11.833
She's sort of
a Cynthia Plaster Caster wannabe.

07:11.833 --> 07:14.416
Hang on. You mean
there's more than one of these people?

07:14.416 --> 07:17.291
If by "people" you mean artists, then yes.

07:17.291 --> 07:20.208
-  Not sure this counts as art.
- This is a real skill.

07:20.208 --> 07:22.625
It takes years to master, okay?

07:22.625 --> 07:26.791
You can't just pull perfectly-sculpted
cocks out of thin air, you know,

07:26.791 --> 07:29.916
like some... some birthday party magician.

07:30.500 --> 07:33.958
What kind of fucked-up
birthday parties have you been going to?

07:43.041 --> 07:47.250
Elvis Presley, as I live and breathe.

07:47.250 --> 07:49.041
What brings you to my studio?

07:49.041 --> 07:50.791
Well, I just figured it was time

07:50.791 --> 07:55.416
to wrap my erect penis in plaster
in front of a total stranger.

07:55.416 --> 07:58.291
Well, then, you've definitely
come to the right place.

08:03.833 --> 08:07.541
So, how's the papier-mâché dick business?

08:07.541 --> 08:11.708
Belittling description aside,
it's going well. Thanks for asking.

08:13.041 --> 08:15.625
I've waited a long time for this.

08:15.625 --> 08:18.333
Well, you're gonna have to wait
just a bit longer, sweetie,

08:18.333 --> 08:21.041
because my buddy here, he's going first.

08:21.041 --> 08:22.250
What?

08:22.250 --> 08:25.333
You know those folks who taste
your food to make sure it's not poisoned?

08:25.333 --> 08:27.625
It's basically that, but for erections.

08:30.333 --> 08:31.583
Don't worry, I got this.

08:31.583 --> 08:35.875
I can tell what any man's penis looks like
just by looking at him.

08:36.750 --> 08:38.291
It's a thing, trust me.

08:52.125 --> 08:53.375
There it is.

08:54.125 --> 08:55.791
That is definitely the one.

08:58.000 --> 08:58.833
Huh?

09:00.375 --> 09:02.416
Oh yeah, well, also could be that one.

09:03.375 --> 09:05.041
Ow! Damn it!

09:05.041 --> 09:07.375
-  Just relax.
- How's it going in there?

09:07.375 --> 09:09.500
- A little hot at first, but...

09:10.000 --> 09:10.833
Ooh!

09:13.083 --> 09:15.041
But then it's like a warm marshmallow

09:15.041 --> 09:18.041
trying to swallow you whole
from the groin up.

09:21.583 --> 09:23.958
Well, you're painting
quite a picture there, buddy,

09:23.958 --> 09:25.416
- but we gotta go.

09:34.083 --> 09:35.833
Wait, what if the Commander's down there?

09:35.833 --> 09:37.291
Bertie's got it covered.

09:40.208 --> 09:42.833
Gotta be honest, I was a little
surprised you invited me over.

09:42.833 --> 09:44.416
You and me both.

09:44.416 --> 09:45.833
- I'm sorry, what?
- Nothing.

09:45.833 --> 09:48.666
I mean,
given how our last date ended.

09:48.666 --> 09:53.458
Oh, you mean the date where you murdered
a bunch of animal rights activists?

09:53.458 --> 09:54.708
Yeah, that's the one.

09:54.708 --> 09:57.791
Know what?
Let's not dwell on the ugly past.

09:57.791 --> 09:59.833
That's my motto. Word for word.

10:01.416 --> 10:04.833
Mind if I slip into something
a little more comfortable?

10:04.833 --> 10:05.791
Mm.

10:05.791 --> 10:07.041
By all means.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.000
Jesus!

10:16.000 --> 10:18.916
Christ almighty!
What the hell are you doing?

10:18.916 --> 10:21.500
Apparently, misreading the room. Fuck.

10:29.625 --> 10:30.791
Wow.

10:30.791 --> 10:32.250
What is this place?

10:32.791 --> 10:36.500
Yeah, and how come he gets all this,
and I can't even get assigned parking?

10:38.583 --> 10:41.250
- Is that--
-  A Beechcraft Bonanza.

10:41.250 --> 10:43.333
Just like the one that killed Buddy Holly.

10:43.333 --> 10:45.250
Uh, more than "just like."

10:45.791 --> 10:47.000
"Project Cricket"?

10:49.833 --> 10:50.750
Is that

10:51.291 --> 10:52.625
the James Dean car?

10:53.333 --> 10:56.750
- There's the Caddy Hank Williams died in.
- Must have all been TCB agents.

10:56.750 --> 10:59.708
More like agents
that TCB got killed, apparently.

11:00.750 --> 11:02.708
Okay, what the hell's with the bathtub?

11:03.666 --> 11:06.916
Holy shit! Is that the one
Jim Morrison died in?

11:06.916 --> 11:08.000
Looks like it.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.791
- Goddamn it!
- What?

11:09.791 --> 11:13.000
I could've been hanging out
with Jim Morrison this whole fucking time?

11:13.000 --> 11:15.416
No offense taken,
in case you're wondering.

11:15.416 --> 11:18.291
Is it just me,
or is it creepy as shit down here?

11:18.291 --> 11:19.291
Yeah.

11:19.291 --> 11:22.083
Speaking of,
you know who'd love this place?

11:22.083 --> 11:23.125
Comfy?

11:23.125 --> 11:24.666
What the hell is this?

11:25.541 --> 11:26.708
Are you fucking insane?

11:26.708 --> 11:30.125
Don't play stupid, Kurt Russell.
You're not that good of an actor.

11:31.041 --> 11:32.500
So you are insane, then.

11:32.500 --> 11:35.125
We both know you killed Walt Disney.

11:35.125 --> 11:37.250
Now you just need to admit it!

11:37.250 --> 11:38.250
Well, I can't.

11:38.791 --> 11:40.666
But only because
I didn't invent lung cancer.

11:40.666 --> 11:43.500
- Oh no, no, no, no!

11:47.458 --> 11:48.500
What's this?

11:48.500 --> 11:52.208
Kinda looks like the Hall of Presidents
at the World's Fair.

11:52.791 --> 11:55.083
Want some popcorn?
There's a machine in the corner.

11:55.083 --> 11:57.291
No. And stop touching things, would you?

11:57.291 --> 11:58.916
We don't know what's booby-trapped.

11:58.916 --> 12:02.458
Who booby-traps popcorn?
Hey, what do you think this button does?

12:03.583 --> 12:05.708
Hey, focus. We're looking for answers.

12:06.250 --> 12:07.541
Care to be more specific?

12:07.541 --> 12:09.333
Project Tupelo. You ever heard of it?

12:09.333 --> 12:10.291
Uh, nope.

12:10.291 --> 12:13.166
But if I were you, then I'd check out
that creepy-ass tarp over there.

12:16.416 --> 12:18.541
- You sure you want to do that?
- What?

12:18.541 --> 12:21.125
I'm just saying,
sometimes ignorance is bliss.

12:21.125 --> 12:24.583
Like when you give herpes to an entire
lacrosse team without even knowing it.

12:25.208 --> 12:26.125
Hypothetically.

12:26.125 --> 12:27.541
You know what you need?

12:28.416 --> 12:30.083
A splash of vermouth would be nice.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.875
What you need is more Jesus in your life.

12:32.875 --> 12:33.791
Ooh.

12:33.791 --> 12:36.458
Afraid I'm gonna
have to pass on the Jesus, yeah.

12:36.458 --> 12:38.583
I'm more of an autotheistic nihilist.

12:38.583 --> 12:40.166
An auto-what now?

12:40.166 --> 12:42.625
It means if there's a God,
it's probably me,

12:42.625 --> 12:44.083
and I still don't give a shit.

12:44.083 --> 12:49.166
See? That right there is exactly why
you need to open your heart to the Lord.

12:49.166 --> 12:50.958
Uh, why?

12:50.958 --> 12:53.666
Because then
maybe you wouldn't strip naked

12:53.666 --> 12:55.416
in the middle of the damn living room

12:55.416 --> 12:58.750
like some half-assed
home invasion porno star.

12:58.750 --> 13:01.041
Where does it say in the Bible
that Jesus never did that?

13:07.500 --> 13:08.791
That's my first guitar.

13:09.375 --> 13:11.333
And there's my old Army uniform.

13:11.333 --> 13:15.458
And that's me backstage at my first
concert at the Overton Park Shell.

13:15.458 --> 13:17.083
This is my whole life.

13:17.583 --> 13:18.666
What's this doing here?

13:18.666 --> 13:21.000
Yeah, real head-scratcher.

13:21.500 --> 13:22.666
I'm going for a refill.

13:33.291 --> 13:34.208
Again!

13:35.208 --> 13:36.375
Again!

13:36.375 --> 13:37.541
Again!

13:37.541 --> 13:39.291
- Again!

13:43.916 --> 13:44.916
Are you okay?

13:45.875 --> 13:46.833
What?

13:46.833 --> 13:49.416
You were mumbling,
like in a trance or something.

13:49.416 --> 13:51.083
Holy shit, I remember.

13:51.583 --> 13:53.750
I mean, not everything, but--

13:53.750 --> 13:56.916
Well, I bet this file
might fill in the gaps.

13:56.916 --> 13:59.083
<i>You fucked with the Commander's shit.</i>

13:59.083 --> 14:00.833
<i>Countermeasures deployed.</i>

14:00.833 --> 14:03.416
Yeah, how about
we don't find out what those are?

14:09.083 --> 14:10.583
Fucking Howard.

14:15.458 --> 14:19.583
Oh hey, listen to me, listen to me.
I didn't fucking kill Walt Disney, okay?

14:19.583 --> 14:21.125
I barely knew the guy.

14:21.125 --> 14:23.958
He was on set
for one day of <i>Follow Me, Boys,</i>

14:23.958 --> 14:25.041
and he was super nice.

14:25.041 --> 14:27.166
I mean, he gave all the kids cigarettes.

14:27.166 --> 14:29.000
Ah, you know what, Kurt?

14:29.000 --> 14:31.625
It kind of feels like
we're just going in circles here.

14:31.625 --> 14:33.875
Well, the important thing is we tried.

14:33.875 --> 14:35.125
Ahem, can I go now?

14:35.125 --> 14:36.250
Or...

14:36.250 --> 14:41.791
maybe instead, we should focus on how
you can pay Walt back for your treachery.

14:42.291 --> 14:44.458
Perhaps, and I'm just spitballing here,

14:44.458 --> 14:46.791
with your entire body.

14:48.083 --> 14:49.708
Actually, minus the head.

14:49.708 --> 14:51.375
The hell are you talking about?

14:51.375 --> 14:53.166
A head transplant, you moron.

14:53.166 --> 14:54.750
A head transplant?

14:54.750 --> 14:55.875
What the fuck?

14:55.875 --> 14:57.208
Just picture it!

14:57.833 --> 15:02.208
Walt's beautiful head
on your just-okay body.

15:03.500 --> 15:04.333
Jesus!

15:09.458 --> 15:11.000
- What's that?

15:11.000 --> 15:11.916
Ugh.

15:14.375 --> 15:16.458
Shit. I gotta get back to the office.

15:16.458 --> 15:19.958
Oh, come on.
Can't you just stay a little bit longer?

15:19.958 --> 15:21.166
Really wish I could. Can't.

15:21.166 --> 15:22.625
Seriously, you can't go.

15:22.625 --> 15:24.416
Okay, wait,
what the hell is going on here?

15:24.416 --> 15:26.666
What? Nothing, I swear.

15:26.666 --> 15:28.000
I'm leaving.

15:29.166 --> 15:31.583
I'm sorry, but I can't let you do that.

15:32.416 --> 15:33.416
Fuck me.

15:34.666 --> 15:35.666
Oh shit.

15:38.875 --> 15:40.583
You thinking what I'm thinking?

15:40.583 --> 15:42.958
Doubt it. I'm still
kind of stuck on the popcorn.

15:57.500 --> 15:58.958
Shit! What now?

15:58.958 --> 16:01.541
What are the chances
that thing's still got gas?

16:02.875 --> 16:03.791
How are we doing?

16:03.791 --> 16:06.500
Great! I'm having a wonderful time!

16:07.583 --> 16:09.666
Ah, ah. Not falling for that again.

16:09.666 --> 16:12.125
Oh good.
So they're invincible and annoying.

16:13.875 --> 16:15.208
No, wait!

16:15.708 --> 16:16.791
We gotta go back!

16:16.791 --> 16:19.333
Nah, what we gotta do
is find a way out of here.

16:19.333 --> 16:20.416
I need that file!

16:20.416 --> 16:22.708
Do you need it more than being alive?

17:10.750 --> 17:11.666
Close one, huh?

17:12.208 --> 17:13.291
So, where are we going?

17:13.916 --> 17:15.875
Maybe go grab a drink, shake it off?

17:16.375 --> 17:18.291
Okay, this is not a reassuring silence.

17:19.416 --> 17:23.708
Say, have either of you seen a young man
with a dotted line across his neck?

17:24.416 --> 17:25.333
I'm going home.

17:25.333 --> 17:27.458
And don't fucking follow me.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.250
- Fine.

17:29.958 --> 17:31.083
Nice tone, by the way.

17:31.750 --> 17:33.791
Met your fun little robot friends.

17:33.791 --> 17:35.125
George!

17:37.125 --> 17:38.833
Yep, looks dead to me.

17:38.833 --> 17:40.875
It wasn't my fault. I swear.

17:40.875 --> 17:43.750
I was just trying to keep him here
like Elvis told me to.

17:43.750 --> 17:46.125
Then look on the bright side:
mission accomplished.

17:46.125 --> 17:47.541
Will you shut the hell up?

17:47.541 --> 17:49.958
Just relax. It'll be fine.

17:49.958 --> 17:50.916
How?

17:50.916 --> 17:54.750
Because this, my friend,
is why God invented unmarked graves.

17:56.000 --> 17:57.625
- A chain saw?
- Well yeah!

17:57.625 --> 18:00.583
If you chop them up,
the body fits in a way smaller hole.

18:00.583 --> 18:02.250
We used to do it on the farm
all the time...

18:02.958 --> 18:03.958
with cows, mostly.

18:08.916 --> 18:09.750
Ah!

18:10.750 --> 18:12.625
Fuck! What the hell are you people doing?

18:12.625 --> 18:13.625
Sit down.

18:16.708 --> 18:18.833
You sit down!
Your friends are about to fuck--

18:18.833 --> 18:20.291
- Oh!

18:20.291 --> 18:23.208
Did you seriously
just give me a warning shot?

18:24.833 --> 18:25.708
Nope.

18:26.291 --> 18:27.250
Ah! Fuck!

18:27.250 --> 18:29.125
That was a warning shot.

18:29.750 --> 18:30.583
Now sit.

18:32.416 --> 18:33.583
What the fuck do you want?

18:33.583 --> 18:37.291
I saw my little tribute wall
down on Sub-Level 7.

18:37.291 --> 18:39.208
Sub-Level 7? What's that?

18:40.583 --> 18:42.083
Goddamn it!

18:42.625 --> 18:45.875
Oh hell, yeah.
Now this is how you get shit done, King.

18:45.875 --> 18:46.791
Good for you.

18:46.791 --> 18:47.958
Project Tupelo.

18:47.958 --> 18:50.166
I told you before, never heard of it.

18:51.375 --> 18:54.083
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Oh, you mean <i>that</i> Project Tupelo.

18:54.083 --> 18:55.083
Start talking.

18:55.083 --> 18:56.250
Okay.

18:57.083 --> 19:00.666
You know, I've been
a fan of yours for a long time.

19:00.666 --> 19:02.333
Mm-hmm. Get that a lot.

19:02.333 --> 19:04.250
Not of your music, sorry.

19:04.250 --> 19:05.583
But of your power.

19:05.583 --> 19:09.500
The way you controlled the audience.
Your legions of fans. It was hypnotic.

19:09.500 --> 19:12.208
Yeah, if you're done blowing me,
how about you get to the point?

19:12.208 --> 19:14.250
You were <i>the</i> cultural phenomenon.

19:14.250 --> 19:17.625
You started a revolution,
sonny boy, and that scared people.

19:17.625 --> 19:20.041
You had Hoover
and the FBI shitting themselves.

19:20.041 --> 19:22.000
- What?
- Oh yeah.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.250
But what they saw as a threat,
I saw as an opportunity.

19:25.250 --> 19:27.375
- For what?
- Oh, you're going to love this.

19:27.375 --> 19:28.708
Somehow I doubt that.

19:28.708 --> 19:31.083
The chance to weaponize rock and roll.

19:31.083 --> 19:32.541
- Sorry?
- Imagine it,

19:33.083 --> 19:37.125
a device that could duplicate the power,
the control you had over people.

19:37.125 --> 19:39.666
But to do that, first we needed you.

19:39.666 --> 19:41.625
So I had you drafted into the Army.

19:41.625 --> 19:42.666
That was you?

19:44.750 --> 19:46.958
Exactly how long
have you been fucking with my life?

19:46.958 --> 19:48.458
<i>We had to study you,</i>

19:48.458 --> 19:51.000
<i>to see what makes you tick,
and that's where Leary comes in.</i>

19:51.000 --> 19:52.750
-  <i>Oh shit.</i>
-  <i>Oh yeah.</i>

19:52.750 --> 19:55.125
<i>He pumped you full
of all kinds of psychedelic crap</i>

19:55.125 --> 19:57.541
<i>that frankly,
I don't even wanna understand.</i>

19:57.541 --> 19:59.750
How come I don't remember any of this?

19:59.750 --> 20:02.875
Well, probably
the exploratory brain surgery.

20:02.875 --> 20:06.375
That, or the mind-erasing chemicals
Leary injected into your eyeball.

20:06.375 --> 20:07.375
It's hard to say which.

20:07.375 --> 20:11.125
The fuck? What, you went inside my head?

20:11.125 --> 20:12.791
Hey, we had to.

20:12.791 --> 20:15.166
That's science. I don't make the rules.

20:15.166 --> 20:18.541
But the good news is
we eventually had a prototype ready,

20:18.541 --> 20:20.416
and we put my idea to the test,

20:20.416 --> 20:24.458
harnessing your essence,
your very DNA, in an actual device.

20:24.458 --> 20:28.083
<i>I mean, if Elvis can send
an audience into a sex-crazed delirium,</i>

20:28.083 --> 20:29.458
<i>what else could it do?</i>

20:29.458 --> 20:31.916
<i>Could it make you punch?
Could it make you kick?</i>

20:32.791 --> 20:34.625
<i>Could it make you kill?</i>

20:35.208 --> 20:36.666
And it worked.

20:37.208 --> 20:38.500
- But--
- But what?

20:38.500 --> 20:40.208
But we couldn't control it.

20:40.208 --> 20:42.875
It turns you into an animal,
a homicidal maniac,

20:42.875 --> 20:44.291
and not in a good way.

20:44.291 --> 20:46.083
You son of a bitch.

20:46.083 --> 20:48.041
Yeah, so we had
to shut the whole thing down.

20:48.041 --> 20:49.875
But hey, you're better now though, right?

20:49.875 --> 20:51.916
So what do you say? Bygones?

20:51.916 --> 20:55.166
You know, I was glad
I destroyed your fucked-up Sub-Level 7,

20:55.166 --> 20:57.958
but now you know
what makes me even more happy?

20:57.958 --> 20:59.958
The fact that I shot you twice.

20:59.958 --> 21:01.083
Please.

21:01.083 --> 21:03.125
The real stuff's on Sub-Level 8.

21:03.125 --> 21:06.875
Sub-Level 7 was just a decoy in case
someone ever stole a copy of my penis.

21:06.875 --> 21:07.833
Look,

21:07.833 --> 21:10.583
I performed
horrifying experiments on your brain,

21:10.583 --> 21:12.083
you shot me a couple of times.

21:12.083 --> 21:13.875
Point is, things happened.

21:13.875 --> 21:15.250
It doesn't matter anymore,

21:15.250 --> 21:17.041
because you're in TCB now.

21:17.541 --> 21:19.166
I've been watching you for years,

21:19.166 --> 21:22.583
and when your '68 comeback special
put you on top of the world,

21:22.583 --> 21:23.958
I knew it was time.

21:23.958 --> 21:27.416
Time for Elvis Presley
to become Agent King,

21:27.416 --> 21:28.875
my greatest triumph!

21:29.625 --> 21:31.708
You really want to throw all that away?

21:32.500 --> 21:34.166
Okay, I really thought I sold that better.

21:34.166 --> 21:36.291
Elvis, look at me.

21:36.291 --> 21:37.958
That won't solve anything.

21:37.958 --> 21:39.541
This probably will though.

21:43.583 --> 21:46.208
Wow! Wow. Solid entrance.

21:46.208 --> 21:47.416
Picking sides, are you?

21:47.416 --> 21:50.166
Look, I know he can be
a complete and total dick sometimes...

21:50.166 --> 21:51.750
Standing right here.

21:51.750 --> 21:53.000
...but you can't kill him.

21:53.000 --> 21:54.750
TCB is the only family I've got.

21:54.750 --> 21:56.833
Sad but true.
I mean, you've met her mother, right?

21:56.833 --> 21:59.708
Look, asshole, I put up
with all your secret agent bullshit

21:59.708 --> 22:01.583
because I thought I could do some good.

22:01.583 --> 22:04.666
Maybe make a difference.
Maybe make tomorrow a little bit better.

22:04.666 --> 22:07.000
Yay. Nice speech. You feeling better now?

22:07.000 --> 22:08.208
You used me.

22:08.208 --> 22:11.666
You used me to create
some kind of rock-and-roll terror weapon.

22:11.666 --> 22:14.041
So no, I'm not exactly feeling better.

22:15.666 --> 22:16.791
But this might help.

22:34.958 --> 22:35.791
I quit.

22:36.291 --> 22:38.583
Now get the fuck out of my house.
