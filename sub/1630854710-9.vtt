00:01.000 --> 00:02.440
Narrator: In the world today,

00:02.480 --> 00:04.640
protecting a country's
borders is vital.

00:06.800 --> 00:09.240
It is seen as a
gateway to the UK.

00:09.280 --> 00:11.560
These are the men
and women in uniform

00:11.600 --> 00:14.480
responsible for safeguarding
Ireland's borders.

00:14.520 --> 00:15.640
Stopping...

00:15.680 --> 00:17.576
Look at me, behind the
yellow line. ..Searching...

00:17.600 --> 00:19.560
Have you been stopped
at a checkpoint before?

00:19.600 --> 00:21.576
Will you just listen to me,
will you just listen to me.

00:21.600 --> 00:25.320
..And seizing drugs,
arms and illegal goods.

00:25.360 --> 00:28.520
If anyone tries to harm me,
that dog will tear them to shreds.

00:28.560 --> 00:31.720
Saving lives... I'd
say about 200km/h.

00:31.760 --> 00:34.080
..And protecting
Ireland's inhabitants

00:34.120 --> 00:36.080
and millions of
visiting tourists.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.520
You could have
been here 100 times,

00:37.560 --> 00:40.600
it doesn't mean that you're
guaranteed to get in the 101st time.

00:40.640 --> 00:43.640
Good boy, Rex.
They police the ports...

00:43.680 --> 00:45.096
You have to make
sure there's definitely

00:45.120 --> 00:46.920
nobody underneath the vehicle.

00:46.960 --> 00:48.440
..The airports...

00:48.480 --> 00:50.056
Why did you tell me
you weren't working?

00:50.080 --> 00:51.560
..And the roads.

00:51.600 --> 00:53.240
These are very
badly damaged straps.

00:53.280 --> 00:56.400
If you can't drive the truck,
you shouldn't be on the road.

00:58.400 --> 01:01.520
These are the
border interceptors.

01:06.800 --> 01:11.920
Coming up, a roadside stop
reveals an unexpected haul of goods.

01:11.960 --> 01:12.960
Do you have receipts

01:13.000 --> 01:14.216
for all this stuff that
you just purchased?

01:14.240 --> 01:16.480
Do you know what's
even in your car?

01:16.520 --> 01:19.200
Without any paperwork
to confirm his story,

01:19.240 --> 01:22.480
it's looking like a long one
way trip for this Indian family.

01:22.520 --> 01:24.880
Supposed to have that
to present to me also.

01:24.920 --> 01:27.400
That way I know that you're
actually married to this person.

01:28.800 --> 01:31.560
And a high speed chase
for a wanted vehicle.

01:40.360 --> 01:43.520
At Dublin airport,
immigration officer ray flannery,

01:43.560 --> 01:45.960
is on the non-eu desk.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.560
His job is to check
every passenger

01:47.600 --> 01:49.960
that arrives from outside
the European Union

01:50.000 --> 01:52.880
has the correct paperwork
to enter the country.

01:52.920 --> 01:54.480
An Indian man has
approached the desk

01:54.520 --> 01:56.840
with his young daughter.

01:56.880 --> 01:59.280
The man has a
visa to enter Ireland

01:59.320 --> 02:01.520
but officer flannery
is doing a final check

02:01.560 --> 02:03.280
before letting the
man and his daughter

02:03.320 --> 02:05.040
into the country.

02:05.080 --> 02:07.320
You're coming here first
time to join your spouse?

02:07.360 --> 02:09.320
Do you have her details?

02:09.360 --> 02:11.000
Her details? Her details.

02:11.040 --> 02:13.160
Yes. She already lives here.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.840
I need her details.

02:14.880 --> 02:18.960
I have no idea who she is, you
have to provide details to me.

02:19.000 --> 02:20.720
I don't have anything.

02:20.760 --> 02:22.480
Well, how do I know
you're coming to them?

02:24.680 --> 02:28.560
You should have her
gnib number, address...

02:28.600 --> 02:30.040
Without any paperwork,

02:30.080 --> 02:33.360
officer flannery can't
confirm the man's story.

02:33.400 --> 02:36.480
The man desperately searches
his phone for information

02:36.520 --> 02:40.000
but at the moment, it's not looking
good for him and his daughter.

02:40.040 --> 02:42.080
You should have
a letter of invitation,

02:42.120 --> 02:44.480
that way I will know
who you're coming to.

02:44.520 --> 02:47.200
The man hands over his
phone with what he says

02:47.240 --> 02:49.960
is a photo of his wife's
immigration permit.

02:50.000 --> 02:51.880
You're supposed to
have all this printed.

02:51.920 --> 02:53.400
I have no idea who
you're coming to.

02:55.200 --> 02:57.600
It's common sense.

02:57.640 --> 03:00.600
But his lack of any physical
paperwork is a problem.

03:00.640 --> 03:03.480
Like I have no... Do you
have a marriage cert?

03:03.520 --> 03:05.960
Marriage cert? Where?

03:07.880 --> 03:10.320
You're supposed to have
that to present to me also.

03:10.360 --> 03:12.920
That way I know that you're
actually married to this person.

03:22.800 --> 03:24.520
You should have them with you

03:24.560 --> 03:26.416
because if I refuse you
permission to come in,

03:26.440 --> 03:28.720
they're no good to you.

03:28.760 --> 03:31.560
You need to have all that now.

03:31.600 --> 03:34.080
It's not looking
good for the man.

03:34.120 --> 03:36.040
If he can't convince
officer flannery

03:36.080 --> 03:39.280
his story checks out, he
may not be let into the country.

03:40.840 --> 03:42.560
That photograph
could be of anybody.

03:44.360 --> 03:46.160
I have no proof.

03:46.200 --> 03:48.160
What's her name?

03:48.200 --> 03:49.280
No, what's her name?

03:52.960 --> 03:55.800
Have you any idea where
she lives? Her address?

03:58.640 --> 04:00.480
Right.

04:00.520 --> 04:01.720
Where is she working?

04:06.280 --> 04:09.520
Officer flannery
continues to quiz him.

04:09.560 --> 04:10.640
Is that her?

04:16.920 --> 04:18.720
Happy his story checks out,

04:18.760 --> 04:21.720
he finally allows the man
and his daughter entry,

04:21.760 --> 04:24.400
but on condition he produces
the required paperwork.

04:29.800 --> 04:33.680
Right, you must go to the
local police in mooncoin,

04:33.720 --> 04:37.360
kilkenny, wherever your
wife registered with her,

04:37.400 --> 04:39.920
bring all your
documents, marriage cert,

04:39.960 --> 04:41.840
everything within three months.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.360
Ok.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.240
Generally people will
have documentation

04:49.280 --> 04:51.240
but unfortunately
a lot of the time,

04:51.280 --> 04:54.160
this documentation is
presented to the embassy

04:54.200 --> 04:56.000
in order to get a visa

04:56.040 --> 04:59.800
and they forget to get a
second copy to show us here.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.176
They presume once
they have the visa,

05:01.200 --> 05:03.480
then everything's ok,
they can just come in.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.560
But we will do a double
check just to make sure

05:05.600 --> 05:06.800
they are who they say they are

05:06.840 --> 05:09.240
and coming to join who they
say they're coming to join.

05:12.440 --> 05:14.840
Today patrolling the
roads around Dublin,

05:14.880 --> 05:18.000
including major access
routes to the airport and the port

05:18.040 --> 05:21.960
are garda traffic officers
paddy mckelroy and Mark fay.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.920
In their unmarked car,
they're keeping a low profile

05:24.960 --> 05:27.280
but expert eye out for
any suspicious activity.

05:28.880 --> 05:31.480
And it's not long before
they pulled over a vehicle

05:31.520 --> 05:33.960
that's pinged up on
their anpr system.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.560
It's suspected that it's
involved in crime, yeah.

05:40.080 --> 05:41.960
So have you been shopping?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.800
Officer mckelroy's suspicions
are immediately aroused

05:44.840 --> 05:46.960
by the cars very full boot.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.296
Do you have receipts
for all this stuff

05:48.320 --> 05:49.520
that you've just purchased?

05:52.960 --> 05:55.120
All this stuff here, where
was all this stuff bought?

05:59.400 --> 06:00.856
A lot of that stuff
looks relatively new,

06:00.880 --> 06:02.360
if you don't mind me asking.

06:04.520 --> 06:06.360
The women's vague
and evasive answers

06:06.400 --> 06:08.480
aren't helping her case.

06:08.520 --> 06:10.560
Basically, the
women can't account

06:10.600 --> 06:12.800
for some of the
stuff that she has

06:12.840 --> 06:16.440
in the boot in terms of
documentary evidence

06:16.480 --> 06:17.600
of purchase.

06:17.640 --> 06:20.360
If it's the case where
the items are stolen,

06:20.400 --> 06:21.840
she could be prosecuted for it.

06:21.880 --> 06:26.760
It's either that or it might be a
case as having stolen property

06:26.800 --> 06:31.240
in a suitcase, if not
more of an offence.

06:31.280 --> 06:34.600
Over half a billion Euros worth
of stock is stolen every year

06:34.640 --> 06:36.360
from retailers in Ireland.

06:36.400 --> 06:39.800
Some of it immediately
heading out of the country.

06:39.840 --> 06:41.000
Where are those clothes from?

06:43.000 --> 06:44.600
Dunnes stores,

06:44.640 --> 06:46.176
I'm just gonna take that
bag out for a second,

06:46.200 --> 06:48.520
I wanna have a look
at that for a second.

06:48.560 --> 06:50.680
You're saying your mother
purchased this for you?

06:50.720 --> 06:53.160
It turns out officers
fay and mckelroy

06:53.200 --> 06:56.000
have every reason
to suspect this women.

06:56.040 --> 06:59.000
She's already known to the
garda as actively being involved

06:59.040 --> 07:00.400
with stolen goods.

07:00.440 --> 07:03.200
And the contents of her
boot look highly suspicious.

07:03.240 --> 07:04.680
Where did you buy that?

07:13.520 --> 07:15.320
You've no...

07:17.120 --> 07:18.296
I don't want to
put it in my car,

07:18.320 --> 07:20.920
if you've purchased
this I don't want to take it.

07:20.960 --> 07:22.696
Why would I want to take
it if you've purchased it?

07:22.720 --> 07:26.640
It turns out this car is full
of new household items.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.000
The hoover, where
did you buy that?

07:30.640 --> 07:33.280
The ashbourne market,
how much did you pay for it?

07:35.160 --> 07:36.440
The George foreman in the back.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.720
You're not backing up
these purchases with receipts,

07:43.760 --> 07:46.000
you see, and there's
all new stuff in it.

07:46.040 --> 07:48.000
What's in behind this seat?

07:48.040 --> 07:49.520
What's in underneath there?

07:49.560 --> 07:51.040
Do you know what's
even in your car?

07:51.080 --> 07:52.800
You've got loads of
new items in your car,

07:52.840 --> 07:54.616
you've no bags for them,
you've no receipts for them,

07:54.640 --> 07:57.320
you can't tell me exactly
where you've bought them.

07:57.360 --> 08:01.120
Unhappy with the women's
inability to provide proof of purchase,

08:01.160 --> 08:05.400
officer mckelroy finally decides
he has no other course of action.

08:05.440 --> 08:07.096
I'll tell you what I'm
going to get you to do.

08:07.120 --> 08:11.640
I'm gonna take the hoover,
the George foreman, the drone.

08:12.760 --> 08:14.960
I'm gonna leave
all the smaller bits.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.856
We're gonna take the
shoes out of river island

08:16.880 --> 08:19.280
and you're going to prove to
me that you purchased them.

08:19.320 --> 08:20.480
Can you do that for me?

08:22.080 --> 08:24.840
And if you prove that
you've purchased all them,

08:24.880 --> 08:26.256
I'll give them back
to you straight away.

08:26.280 --> 08:27.280
(Indistinct speech)

08:27.320 --> 08:30.320
If the women can't prove she
purchased the items seized,

08:30.360 --> 08:33.400
she's looking at a date in
court and possible jail time

08:33.440 --> 08:35.280
as a repeat offender.

08:35.320 --> 08:38.160
Particularly if officer
mckelroy turns up evidence

08:38.200 --> 08:39.960
the items are stolen.

08:40.000 --> 08:41.320
Alright.

08:41.360 --> 08:44.000
For now, the women
is allowed on her way

08:44.040 --> 08:46.800
but with a
significantly lighter car.

08:46.840 --> 08:49.160
It's all barcodes on them,
there's all tags in them

08:49.200 --> 08:50.456
so we'll approach
the relevant stores

08:50.480 --> 08:51.760
and ask them,

08:51.800 --> 08:53.096
see if they can give
us any information

08:53.120 --> 08:55.120
and shed any light
on this investigation.

08:58.480 --> 09:01.640
Back at Dublin airport,
detective garda ray flannery

09:01.680 --> 09:05.280
is processing passengers
and the non-eu desk.

09:05.320 --> 09:07.040
How are you?

09:07.080 --> 09:08.520
Thank you. Thank you.

09:08.560 --> 09:11.240
He needs to see a passport
and potentially a visa

09:11.280 --> 09:12.400
and paperwork

09:12.440 --> 09:15.400
before he lets any
passenger into the country.

09:15.440 --> 09:17.560
The maximum we allow
any non-eu nationals

09:17.600 --> 09:19.320
to stay here is 90 days.

09:19.360 --> 09:23.440
If they have a reason to extend
past that, and a valid reason,

09:23.480 --> 09:26.520
they would then go to
the local immigration officer

09:26.560 --> 09:29.200
and look for permission
to extend past 90 days.

09:29.240 --> 09:30.720
And why are you here?

09:32.480 --> 09:33.680
You're living here. Yeah.

09:33.720 --> 09:35.320
Do you have a gnib card? Yeah.

09:36.720 --> 09:39.200
The gnib card which
was recently replaced

09:39.240 --> 09:42.800
by the Irish resident
permit, allows non-eu citizens

09:42.840 --> 09:45.960
to stay and work in
Ireland beyond 90 days.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.680
What do you do here?

09:47.720 --> 09:49.016
Are you working here?
Yeah, I'm working.

09:49.040 --> 09:50.360
Where?

09:58.440 --> 09:59.560
Lovely, thank you.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.160
The next passenger at
officer flannery's booth

10:02.200 --> 10:04.600
is also looking to stay in
Ireland beyond 90 days.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.840
Now how long will you stay here?

10:13.200 --> 10:14.480
You're living here? Yeah.

10:14.520 --> 10:16.480
Gnib card.

10:17.640 --> 10:20.200
The women struggles to
find her immigration card

10:20.240 --> 10:23.920
to prove she should be
allowed back into the country.

10:23.960 --> 10:25.960
And when she does,
there's an issue.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.160
It's expired.

10:48.640 --> 10:49.720
You got married when?

10:53.960 --> 10:56.120
He flew back?
Yeah, he flew back.

10:56.160 --> 10:58.120
Why?

10:58.160 --> 11:00.960
Is he not living here?
Is he not living here?

11:03.920 --> 11:05.960
Oh, he flew back here?
Yeah, he flew back here.

11:11.120 --> 11:13.200
Her gnib had expired,
she had left here

11:13.240 --> 11:17.160
before re registering
but while she was away,

11:17.200 --> 11:19.400
back in her home
country she had remarried.

11:19.440 --> 11:21.080
And who's Moses?

11:21.120 --> 11:22.760
Moses is my
ex-husband. Ex-husband.

11:22.800 --> 11:23.800
Yeah.

11:23.840 --> 11:26.360
So she's now coming
in to re-register,

11:26.400 --> 11:28.480
she has a child
here as well with her,

11:28.520 --> 11:31.640
so she was given 90 days
to go back and re-register.

11:31.680 --> 11:34.040
People re-register
every single year

11:34.080 --> 11:36.440
so we know exactly
what people are doing.

11:36.480 --> 11:39.480
The system has to
be updated constantly.

11:39.520 --> 11:41.360
Happy her story checks out,

11:41.400 --> 11:44.000
officer flannery allows
the women entry.

11:44.040 --> 11:46.720
Now you must go and
re-register within three months.

11:46.760 --> 11:50.760
You need to bring
your new marriage cert

11:50.800 --> 11:52.520
and all your details again

11:52.560 --> 11:54.200
back to the office
in the city centre.

11:56.640 --> 12:00.120
We hold on to this card
because it's expired, ok.

12:00.160 --> 12:01.160
You're holding that?

12:01.200 --> 12:03.960
Yeah, once it's
expired we hold on to it.

12:04.000 --> 12:05.880
So maybe I'm going to need it.

12:05.920 --> 12:07.696
You won't need it, it's
expired so it's no good.

12:07.720 --> 12:08.720
Ok.

12:08.760 --> 12:11.560
So you can tell them that
it's been retained here.

12:11.600 --> 12:14.000
Ok. If they ask.

12:14.040 --> 12:17.600
It will cost the women
300 Euros to re-register,

12:17.640 --> 12:19.416
but she'll then be
allowed to stay in Ireland

12:19.440 --> 12:21.120
for another 12 months.

12:27.800 --> 12:31.360
Back on patrol around Dublin
airport with officers mckelroy and fay.

12:34.920 --> 12:38.520
They don't get far before
they're called into action.

12:38.560 --> 12:41.040
It's a warning for a
suspicious vehicle.

12:43.640 --> 12:45.000
Hitting the blues and twos,

12:45.040 --> 12:47.240
the officers race to
the nearby location

12:47.280 --> 12:48.480
of the suspicious vehicle.

12:56.800 --> 12:59.480
It's not long before they
spot the car and pull it over.

13:06.600 --> 13:09.800
Officer fay now needs to find
out if everything is above board

13:09.840 --> 13:11.400
with this vehicle
and it's driver.

13:15.840 --> 13:17.176
I'm just having a
gander at the car.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.960
I'm just having a look to see.

13:21.240 --> 13:23.680
It's your brother's
vehicle, is it?

13:25.280 --> 13:26.416
Do you have the
insurance cert with you

13:26.440 --> 13:28.840
or just the documentation
of this man?

13:30.080 --> 13:31.696
Oh, did you? Oh, well
if you've produced it,

13:31.720 --> 13:33.536
well then I won't make
another producer off you,

13:33.560 --> 13:34.560
you know what I mean.

13:34.600 --> 13:37.560
In fairness, obviously it would
be. This your current address is it?

13:39.840 --> 13:41.080
Although the man doesn't have

13:41.120 --> 13:43.520
the cars insurance
certificate on him,

13:43.560 --> 13:45.240
he claims to have
recently shown police

13:45.280 --> 13:47.440
the original copy.

13:47.480 --> 13:50.840
Control, just see if there's
any recent dlaps there please.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.680
Having confirmed the
man is telling the truth,

13:55.720 --> 13:58.240
officer fay returns to the car.

13:58.280 --> 14:02.560
Yeah you produced that
on the fourth of July you did.

14:02.600 --> 14:05.080
You don't have anything you
shouldn't have in the car do you?

14:07.040 --> 14:09.240
I'm asking if you
mind me searching.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.120
Your fathers in hospital?
Look, I do appreciate (inaudible).

14:14.160 --> 14:15.920
It may be suspicious

14:15.960 --> 14:18.280
but because the driver's
documents are all in order

14:18.320 --> 14:21.240
and he's given no indication
of committing a crime,

14:21.280 --> 14:23.800
he's entitled to refuse
officer fay's request.

14:25.440 --> 14:27.400
That's fair enough,
I fully appreciate it.

14:27.440 --> 14:30.360
As there's a marker
down on the system

14:30.400 --> 14:33.720
that it's flagging up for
whatever reason, alright?

14:33.760 --> 14:36.160
The officers allow
the vehicle to go,

14:36.200 --> 14:39.040
but next time this driver
might not be so lucky.

14:43.520 --> 14:45.440
In granard, county longford,

14:45.480 --> 14:47.600
road safety
investigator Jim Fleming,

14:47.640 --> 14:48.880
working with the police,

14:48.920 --> 14:51.120
has set up a check
point on the main

14:51.160 --> 14:53.080
running to the border
with northern Ireland.

14:55.040 --> 14:57.920
With Ireland exporting
around 340 million Euros

14:57.960 --> 15:00.320
worth of forestry
products every year,

15:00.360 --> 15:02.640
cross-border wood
trucking is big business.

15:04.280 --> 15:06.280
How you getting on?

15:06.320 --> 15:08.800
Today, Jim and his team
are doing spot checks

15:08.840 --> 15:10.880
to make sure these
trucks and their drivers

15:10.920 --> 15:13.680
are following safety
and security regulations.

15:13.720 --> 15:15.760
Do you mind me having a
look at your tacho please?

15:17.200 --> 15:20.320
The tachograph will tell
Jim details of how fast,

15:20.360 --> 15:23.080
how far and how long the
vehicle has been driven.

15:25.480 --> 15:28.880
While the data downloads, he
takes a look at the driver's card

15:28.920 --> 15:31.360
which keeps a record of
the specific driver's data.

15:34.680 --> 15:37.680
The commercial driver is allowed
to do a maximum of 90 hours

15:37.720 --> 15:39.760
in any two week period

15:39.800 --> 15:43.080
and a maximum of ten
hours in any one day.

15:43.120 --> 15:46.360
Drivers face a fine of 5,000
Euros for breaking the rules.

15:49.600 --> 15:52.440
The data on the card makes
for shocking viewing for Jim.

15:54.480 --> 15:57.560
The driver card in this
case is showing that

15:57.600 --> 15:59.696
back in the beginning of may
he was working for a period

15:59.720 --> 16:02.040
of 102 hours.

16:02.080 --> 16:05.080
Obviously he can't be
working for four days.

16:05.120 --> 16:09.120
If he were to be working
for 102 hours and 7 minutes

16:09.160 --> 16:11.080
without a break, that
would be quite serious.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.016
But it this case it's just
the card is in the machine

16:13.040 --> 16:14.880
and the machine
thinks he's working.

16:14.920 --> 16:17.320
It's clearly not correct.

16:17.360 --> 16:19.720
You were off there
last week, were you?

16:19.760 --> 16:21.960
From the first.

16:22.000 --> 16:25.800
You're tacho was out
of work for four days.

16:25.840 --> 16:28.760
When you eject the card then it
closes off your mileage reading

16:28.800 --> 16:30.520
and your odometer
readings for that day.

16:30.560 --> 16:31.976
Probably the best
practise to eject it

16:32.000 --> 16:33.400
and put it back in
again, you know.

16:37.440 --> 16:40.120
Having advised the trucker
about his driver's card,

16:40.160 --> 16:42.400
Jim checks the tacho data.

16:42.440 --> 16:45.640
It's also flagged
an infringement.

16:45.680 --> 16:48.480
The maximum daily
driving time is ten hours.

16:48.520 --> 16:52.080
On the day here he drove
for ten hours and two minutes.

16:52.120 --> 16:54.680
The regulations are the
regulations so if somebody is driving

16:54.720 --> 16:56.200
for ten hours and two

16:56.240 --> 16:58.000
it will flag it up as a
minor infringement.

16:59.520 --> 17:01.800
Jim considers the
nature of the offence

17:01.840 --> 17:04.640
and given how minor
it is, uses his discretion.

17:05.720 --> 17:06.720
Thank you.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.720
On this occasion,
there's a verbal reprimand

17:08.760 --> 17:11.120
before the driver is
allowed to be on his way.

17:18.200 --> 17:21.200
There are approximately
350,000 goods vehicles

17:21.240 --> 17:22.720
on the road in Ireland.

17:22.760 --> 17:25.960
Travelling between borders
and from coastal ports to airports.

17:27.640 --> 17:28.800
Yeah, that's fine.

17:32.360 --> 17:35.360
Road safety authority safety
inspector Tommy Wright

17:35.400 --> 17:38.440
is conducting roadside
checks on hgvs

17:38.480 --> 17:41.480
using the roads leading
north to the border.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.360
The road safety
authority have developed

17:43.400 --> 17:45.760
a simple vehicle
walk around checklist,

17:45.800 --> 17:48.160
to assist drivers in
carrying out inspections

17:48.200 --> 17:49.480
of their own vehicles.

17:51.480 --> 17:54.400
After being pulled over for
an on the spot inspection,

17:54.440 --> 17:57.920
this trucker is about to
get the full rsa treatment.

17:57.960 --> 18:00.000
Have you ever been stopped
at a checkpoint before?

18:01.120 --> 18:02.120
Ok.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.016
We do lights front and
back, engines and trailer

18:04.040 --> 18:05.880
and I'll have a walk round.

18:05.920 --> 18:10.000
The check is now a legal requirement
before taking a vehicle on the road

18:10.040 --> 18:12.760
and it's going to be very
easy for the inspector to see

18:12.800 --> 18:14.560
if it's been completed or not.

18:14.600 --> 18:17.160
Ok, give the steering wheel
a good shake for me, yeah.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.080
Press down on the foot
break. The other way.

18:22.120 --> 18:26.760
Approximately 10% of all collisions
are caused by vehicle defects.

18:26.800 --> 18:30.280
So it's important for the safety
of everyone using Ireland's roads,

18:30.320 --> 18:32.360
that the vehicles are
maintained properly

18:32.400 --> 18:35.360
and that the drivers themselves
know what issues to look out for.

18:36.920 --> 18:39.400
That's the steering column
coming down that the driver

18:39.440 --> 18:42.120
has the steering wheel,
and if you look down there,

18:42.160 --> 18:44.080
it's the steering box

18:44.120 --> 18:48.360
and it's power assisted
so it's filled with fluid.

18:48.400 --> 18:52.200
Lots of the time, the top seal
gives problems and it leaks.

18:52.240 --> 18:53.480
See the oil.

18:55.560 --> 18:58.320
Do you know your steering
box is leaking fairly badly,

18:58.360 --> 18:59.640
have you topped it up?

19:01.400 --> 19:02.920
Do you know it's leaking?

19:02.960 --> 19:04.520
Have you reported it?

19:06.160 --> 19:07.760
Well, have you
written down then?

19:09.080 --> 19:10.920
He also needs to check the cab

19:10.960 --> 19:13.680
from collecting tachograph
data to sounding the horn.

19:15.080 --> 19:16.200
Horn.

19:19.920 --> 19:21.440
Is the horn working,
Tommy, is it?

19:22.920 --> 19:24.080
When was it working?

19:25.280 --> 19:27.040
Have you checked it today like?

19:28.680 --> 19:31.400
Are you wearing that
seatbelt. Yes sir, I had that on.

19:31.440 --> 19:34.080
It's not pushing
back in that well, like.

19:34.120 --> 19:35.360
Why have you it like that then?

19:37.320 --> 19:38.720
But sure it's no good.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.656
If you were in involved
in an accident like that

19:40.680 --> 19:42.280
it's no good to you.

19:42.320 --> 19:44.720
The check is not
going well for this driver

19:44.760 --> 19:46.240
and it gets worse.

19:46.280 --> 19:48.640
You have a break pad
indicator light on there.

19:48.680 --> 19:50.280
Yeah. How long is it like that?

19:50.320 --> 19:55.080
That's only just like that
and the breaks are good on it.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.416
That's why you need
to have the book.

19:56.440 --> 19:59.040
When you see something
like with the horn not working

19:59.080 --> 20:02.480
or something wrong with the
seatbelt or you have a fault like that,

20:02.520 --> 20:04.856
you need to record it and you
need to report it to your boss

20:04.880 --> 20:06.480
and see what's happened then.

20:06.520 --> 20:08.280
Alright, I'll keep
looking around.

20:09.320 --> 20:11.280
Safety inspector
Wright now takes a look

20:11.320 --> 20:14.720
at the trucks tyres, an area
where defects have been found

20:14.760 --> 20:16.760
to be a major
factor in accidents.

20:16.800 --> 20:19.600
I'm looking at the
tyre, it's on the limits

20:19.640 --> 20:21.800
but it's ok at the minute
so I'll check to see

20:21.840 --> 20:24.520
it's probably empty like and see
where he's going with that thing.

20:28.080 --> 20:31.160
Having completed all
22 individual checks,

20:31.200 --> 20:32.880
inspector Wright
shares the results

20:32.920 --> 20:34.960
with the police officer
on duty with him,

20:35.000 --> 20:37.040
garda Liam lawler.

20:37.080 --> 20:38.640
Horn not working. Yeah.

20:39.960 --> 20:41.880
Seatbelt not working. Yeah.

20:41.920 --> 20:42.920
Break pad indicator.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.776
They have the power to
pull the vehicle off the road

20:44.800 --> 20:46.400
and impound it
should it not reach

20:46.440 --> 20:48.600
the necessary level
of road worthiness.

20:48.640 --> 20:50.800
You know the way you
have the circle of the dash.

20:50.840 --> 20:52.480
Was there any
indication of which break?

20:52.520 --> 20:53.920
No, there's not on that side.

20:56.320 --> 20:58.560
Safety inspector
Wright and garda lawler

20:58.600 --> 20:59.880
go through the list of faults

20:59.920 --> 21:01.640
as they decide how
they need to proceed.

21:03.520 --> 21:05.456
The other side, he's
Amber on both the for tacho

21:05.480 --> 21:06.640
and for road worthiness.

21:06.680 --> 21:08.200
Yeah.

21:08.240 --> 21:12.360
Alright Tom, so you need
to get that seatbelt sorted

21:12.400 --> 21:14.760
so that it's
retracting properly.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.880
It's important that you
sort out what the issue is

21:16.920 --> 21:18.496
in relation to the
break pad indicator,

21:18.520 --> 21:20.800
get that sorted before you
bring it on the road again.

21:20.840 --> 21:22.800
She's empty, the
trailer, I presume, yeah.

21:22.840 --> 21:24.640
So you need to get
that tyre sorted as well

21:24.680 --> 21:26.040
before you put a load on it.

21:26.080 --> 21:29.000
So you're given the chance
to go and get stuff done

21:29.040 --> 21:30.456
rather than having
someone to come out

21:30.480 --> 21:32.400
and do the stuff here for you.

21:32.440 --> 21:34.520
So that's fair enough, isn't it?

21:34.560 --> 21:35.560
Ok, good man.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.160
This driver's been luck,

21:37.200 --> 21:39.760
he's able to continue
with his journey.

21:39.800 --> 21:44.280
He's going on his way with a
warning and a list of jobs to complete

21:44.320 --> 21:46.440
and he has ten days to do it.

21:46.480 --> 21:48.880
Is that ok? Good
man, thanks Tom.
