BASED ON THE MANGA
BY JIRO TANIGUCHI AND BAKU YUMEMAKURA

01:08.916 --> 01:09.791
<i>Walking.</i>

01:11.125 --> 01:12.000
<i>Climbing.</i>

01:12.708 --> 01:13.833
<i>More climbing.</i>

01:14.833 --> 01:15.958
<i>Always higher.</i>

01:17.666 --> 01:18.708
<i>And for what?</i>

02:42.583 --> 02:44.375
<i>My name is Fukamachi Makoto.</i>

02:46.041 --> 02:48.000
<i>I take photos for magazines.</i>

02:49.208 --> 02:53.041
<i>That year, I was following a Japanese team</i>
<i>up the southwest face of Everest.</i>

03:00.958 --> 03:03.541
<i>This is base camp. Do you read me?</i>

03:04.125 --> 03:06.000
<i>This is Tanaka. I read you.</i>

03:06.083 --> 03:08.583
<i>A major front is approaching. Turn back.</i>

03:08.666 --> 03:11.583
<i>We're almost there,</i>
<i>we can't turn back now.</i>

03:11.666 --> 03:14.291
<i>You're behind schedule.</i>
<i>The storm will arrive before you.</i>

03:14.375 --> 03:15.750
<i>We'll take our chances.</i>

03:16.250 --> 03:18.791
<i>Too risky. You're too far behind schedule.</i>

03:18.875 --> 03:20.875
<i>Do you hear me? Tanaka?</i>

03:30.750 --> 03:32.916
No summit this time. A waste of time.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.166
-<i>What?</i>
<i>-</i>They didn't make it past 8,000 m.

03:35.250 --> 03:36.333
<i>Even with oxygen?</i>

03:36.416 --> 03:39.458
They were ill-prepared.
That's not how the southwest face is done.

03:39.541 --> 03:42.041
-<i>Where did they get to?</i>
-Just after camp 5.

03:42.541 --> 03:45.208
Tanaka and Goto did well,
but couldn't stay on schedule.

03:45.291 --> 03:48.083
Conditions on the ridge weren't great.
They had to turn back.

03:48.166 --> 03:50.166
<i>Got enough for a double-page spread?</i>

03:50.250 --> 03:53.208
-This is the last time I'm doing this.
-<i>Stop whining.</i>

03:53.291 --> 03:55.291
<i>You're outdoors, seeing the world.</i>

03:55.375 --> 03:57.875
I'm wasting my time.
My photos are worthless.

03:57.958 --> 04:01.041
<i>-See you in the newsroom on Monday.</i>
-Yeah. Bye.

04:01.750 --> 04:03.875
Fukamachi, your beer's getting warm.

04:03.958 --> 04:05.833
-Yeah.
-You're a round behind.

04:05.916 --> 04:07.166
Okay, coming.

04:12.375 --> 04:13.208
Hey.

04:13.708 --> 04:14.833
Hello.

04:15.625 --> 04:16.541
Journalist?

04:17.125 --> 04:18.041
Yeah.

04:22.666 --> 04:24.333
Looking for a scoop?

04:25.000 --> 04:27.000
How about Mallory's camera?

04:27.083 --> 04:28.125
Look.

04:28.791 --> 04:30.708
Mallory's camera, I said. Look.

04:31.791 --> 04:33.708
Authentic. It came from up there.

04:33.791 --> 04:35.125
You know the story?

04:35.625 --> 04:37.208
That's a scoop, right?

04:37.875 --> 04:39.208
I'll give you a good price.

04:39.291 --> 04:40.625
What are you on about?

04:40.708 --> 04:43.250
10,000 rupees, 200 dollars. A bargain!

04:43.750 --> 04:44.750
Forget it!

04:46.000 --> 04:47.083
Poor bastard.

04:47.833 --> 04:49.416
No idea what you're missing.

04:50.833 --> 04:53.375
-Hello--
-<i>You've reached Nepal Airlines.</i>

04:53.458 --> 04:56.583
<i>All our lines are busy.</i>
<i>Please call back later.</i>

05:00.333 --> 05:02.708
<i>I know you can't strike gold every day.</i>

05:02.791 --> 05:04.041
<i>That's how it is.</i>

05:04.583 --> 05:07.291
<i>But I was starting to wonder</i>
<i>what I was doing there.</i>

05:14.000 --> 05:16.583
-I'd never do that.
-What did you do with it?

05:17.083 --> 05:18.958
No need to get angry.

05:19.041 --> 05:20.333
I'll explain!

05:20.416 --> 05:21.791
Stop!

05:24.041 --> 05:25.541
-Hey.
-Give it back.

05:26.125 --> 05:27.666
Okay, wait.

05:28.250 --> 05:29.208
Here.

06:00.083 --> 06:01.041
Hey, wait!

06:05.166 --> 06:06.041
Habu.

07:48.250 --> 07:49.166
Come on!

08:01.208 --> 08:04.083
<i>The summit of Everest was reached in 1953.</i>

08:05.041 --> 08:06.791
<i>But that wasn't the first attempt.</i>

08:08.291 --> 08:09.791
<i>In 1924,</i>

08:09.875 --> 08:11.791
<i>on June 8, at 12:50,</i>

08:11.875 --> 08:14.791
<i>Englishman George Mallory</i>
<i>and his climbing partner were last seen</i>

08:14.875 --> 08:17.291
<i>on the north ridge, near the summit.</i>

08:18.541 --> 08:21.541
<i>They never returned.</i>
<i>Nobody knows if they succeeded.</i>

08:22.958 --> 08:26.833
<i>But we know they had a camera</i>
<i>to take home proof if victorious.</i>

08:27.750 --> 08:29.625
<i>A Vest Pocket Autographic.</i>

08:31.708 --> 08:34.500
<i>If someone were to find the camera</i>
<i>and develop the film,</i>

08:35.083 --> 08:38.500
<i>they'd have the answer to the question</i>
<i>that's been asked for years.</i>

08:39.750 --> 08:42.708
<i>Was Mallory the first person</i>
<i>to conquer Everest?</i>

08:43.750 --> 08:44.833
<i>Butâ€¦</i>

08:45.916 --> 08:47.250
<i>there was only one problem.</i>

08:47.750 --> 08:48.708
YU PUBLISHING COMPANY

08:48.791 --> 08:51.625
I searched the whole neighborhood,
asked shopkeepers. Nothing.

08:51.708 --> 08:52.541
The guy's a ghost.

08:53.125 --> 08:54.375
But I'm sure it was him.

08:54.458 --> 08:55.416
Habu Joji?

08:55.500 --> 08:57.750
-The Habu Joji?
-Is there another?

08:57.833 --> 09:01.916
The guy disappeared years go. He suddenly
resurfaces with Mallory's camera?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.083
Right under your nose?

09:03.166 --> 09:04.625
He was good climber.

09:04.708 --> 09:08.041
He may well have found the body
near the summit and taken the camera.

09:08.125 --> 09:10.083
People have looked
for Mallory for 70 years.

09:10.166 --> 09:12.833
If he'd been found, we'd know.
You aren't sure it's Habu.

09:12.916 --> 09:15.916
-What about this?
-He's not the only one to lose fingers.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.166
That proves nothing about the camera.

09:18.250 --> 09:19.791
The Vest Pocket is common.

09:19.875 --> 09:20.916
You know that.

09:21.000 --> 09:24.208
No. So why would Habu
have been fighting with that guy?

09:24.875 --> 09:26.291
Why didn't you ask him?

09:28.291 --> 09:30.625
I looked everywhere,
but you know Kathmandu.

09:31.958 --> 09:33.458
Well, in the meantime,

09:33.541 --> 09:35.958
I'll take this one for the cover.

09:36.041 --> 09:38.416
This one isn't bad,
but it needs to be reframed.

09:38.500 --> 09:41.625
If Mallory made it, it could change
the history of mountaineering.

09:41.708 --> 09:43.458
The first man on Everest.

09:43.541 --> 09:44.791
We can't let this go.

09:45.375 --> 09:46.666
I have to find Habu.

09:46.750 --> 09:49.041
People here knew him, they could help.

09:53.625 --> 09:56.291
Listen, the camera's buried
in the snow with Mallory.

09:56.375 --> 09:58.166
No one cares about Habu.

09:58.250 --> 09:59.291
Forget it.

10:02.333 --> 10:05.333
If I get them, can I get
the exclusive on Mallory's photos?

10:07.041 --> 10:09.541
And a cut of the copyright royalties.

10:11.541 --> 10:12.583
Okay, sure.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.250
<i>It was going to be tough to find Habu.</i>

10:20.833 --> 10:24.041
<i>He no longer had an address,</i>
<i>family, or friends in Japan.</i>

10:24.125 --> 10:25.166
-Hello?
<i>-Yes, hello?</i>

10:25.250 --> 10:27.958
My name is Fukamachi Makoto.
I'm a journalist.

10:28.041 --> 10:31.208
<i>-I wanted to talk to you about Habu Joji.</i>
<i>-Who?</i>

10:31.291 --> 10:32.291
<i>Habu Joji.</i>

10:34.333 --> 10:37.041
<i>Yet, during the 1960s,</i>
<i>he had a certain notoriety.</i>

10:37.125 --> 10:40.750
<i>Because of his speed and unique style,</i>
<i>he was considered a prodigy.</i>

10:42.125 --> 10:45.500
<i>He'd accomplished some firsts,</i>
<i>winter ascents, speed records.</i>

10:45.583 --> 10:48.500
<i>In mountaineering circles,</i>
<i>his career looked promising.</i>

10:49.583 --> 10:52.250
<i>People even said he was one</i>
<i>of the best of his generation.</i>

10:56.208 --> 10:58.875
<i>Then one day, he disappeared.</i>
<i>Just like that.</i>

10:58.958 --> 11:01.666
<i>Vanished. What happened to him?</i>

11:18.541 --> 11:21.458
-Grab this bag.
-It's okay. I've got it. Thanks.

11:21.541 --> 11:24.208
-Anyone got the bag with the carabiners?
-Under the seat.

11:24.291 --> 11:26.000
Who coiled this rope?

11:27.416 --> 11:30.000
-Shall I carry your bag?
-Anything else?

11:30.083 --> 11:31.125
It's okay.

11:31.208 --> 11:35.250
Go on, come with me. It's only a week.
There are great routes to do.

11:35.333 --> 11:37.416
I can't Habu. We just got back.

11:37.500 --> 11:39.916
It's a new job, it's important.
I can't just take off.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.666
I can talk to your boss. Tell him
you're more productive after climbing.

11:44.416 --> 11:46.125
-As if.
-Fancy bowling on Saturday?

11:46.208 --> 11:47.583
-Yeah.
-Good idea.

11:47.666 --> 11:49.208
I'll thrash you.

11:49.291 --> 11:51.791
Guys, bowling on Saturday. You coming?

11:51.875 --> 11:54.083
Sure. I'm the strike king.

11:54.166 --> 11:57.416
We're going running on Saturday.
You haven't forgotten?

11:57.500 --> 11:58.916
No, of course not.

11:59.416 --> 12:01.250
Sorry, we can't Saturday.

12:01.333 --> 12:03.000
It's been planned for ages.

12:04.916 --> 12:06.208
Good news, gentlemen.

12:06.291 --> 12:07.791
Toshiro's been fired?

12:08.458 --> 12:11.500
-We're getting a new truck?
-Even better. We're going to Nepal.

12:12.791 --> 12:15.916
I found a sponsor
for the Annapurna expedition.

12:16.000 --> 12:19.625
But they only cover half the cost.
You'll have to cover the rest.

12:19.708 --> 12:21.000
-Yes.
-Okay.

12:21.083 --> 12:23.541
I'm aware
that not everyone can afford to go.

12:23.625 --> 12:24.583
If we're successful,

12:24.666 --> 12:26.791
the next expedition
will be better financed.

12:26.875 --> 12:30.000
As for visas, don't forget
to apply before next month.

12:30.083 --> 12:33.250
We have a lot of equipment to buy.
I'd like us to discuss it together.

12:33.333 --> 12:36.541
-Toshiro, take care of the accounts.
-Yes, no problem.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.916
I'll hand out the forms
for the climbing permits.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.833
Things take time, so don't hang about--

12:46.583 --> 12:48.458
They aren't skilled enough to go.

12:48.541 --> 12:51.375
They don't train enough.
They're always partying.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.875
They don't even climb 50 days a year.

12:54.958 --> 12:57.166
We should be going. We're better!

12:58.541 --> 13:00.500
Just because they can afford to pay.

13:00.583 --> 13:02.250
Do you think that's right?

13:02.875 --> 13:04.208
Throw that thing away!

13:04.291 --> 13:06.958
That's why you struggle
to breathe at high altitude.

13:08.041 --> 13:09.500
Money, sponsorsâ€¦

13:10.791 --> 13:13.125
if we were famous, we'd have sponsors.

13:17.041 --> 13:20.833
We'll make a name for ourselves.
Do something no one's ever done.

13:20.916 --> 13:23.625
-Are you game?
-Yeah. What do you have in mind?

13:23.708 --> 13:24.708
Demon Wall.

13:24.791 --> 13:28.375
In winter? You're crazy.
It's impossible. No one does that.

13:28.458 --> 13:29.291
Exactly.

14:27.666 --> 14:30.208
You're still here? You're the last one.

14:30.291 --> 14:33.791
The first winter ascent up Demon Wall.
Not bad for the time.

14:33.875 --> 14:37.125
Yeah. Have you made any progress?
Do you have any leads?

14:37.208 --> 14:38.750
I called the embassy.

14:38.833 --> 14:41.958
Habu arrived in Nepal
eight years ago, but his visa's expired.

14:42.041 --> 14:45.166
He's in hiding. That's why he ran
when I recognized him.

14:45.750 --> 14:49.083
-What's that got to do with the camera?
-I'll find it.

14:49.166 --> 14:50.083
Okay.

14:50.166 --> 14:51.333
Have fun.

14:53.458 --> 14:56.833
<i>The other club members</i>
<i>who went to Annapurna had failed.</i>

14:56.916 --> 15:00.125
<i>Everyone returned safely,</i>
<i>but no one reached the summit.</i>

15:00.208 --> 15:02.750
I'm raising my glass to Inoue and Habu.

15:02.833 --> 15:05.958
-Yes, thank you. Cheers.
-Bravo.

15:06.041 --> 15:07.416
<i>Habu got his revenge.</i>

15:07.500 --> 15:08.500
Well done, boys.

15:08.583 --> 15:10.583
Lucky you're here
to redeem the club's image.

15:10.666 --> 15:12.166
Others should take note.

15:12.250 --> 15:15.541
-We were being careful. Safety first.
-Yeah, just being professional.

15:15.625 --> 15:19.333
Still, the Demon Wall,
that's incredible, and with that weather!

15:19.416 --> 15:21.500
Hey, they got lucky is all.

15:21.583 --> 15:22.750
It wasn't luck.

15:24.208 --> 15:27.375
We set up the bivouac
and waited for the right moment.

15:27.875 --> 15:31.291
You need a nice day. The sun melts
the snow and clears the route.

15:31.375 --> 15:33.541
An overnight freeze
to set the snow that's left

15:33.625 --> 15:35.958
so that it doesn't fall on you.
Then you go.

15:36.041 --> 15:38.875
Only it started snowing during the day.
We took a hammering.

15:38.958 --> 15:41.291
The powder snowfalls were a real pain.

15:41.375 --> 15:44.833
-We had to be quick.
-We didn't hang around!

15:45.500 --> 15:48.416
The hardest part
was the icefall and the overhang.

15:48.500 --> 15:50.458
You should've seen it, a real barricade!

15:50.541 --> 15:52.250
But I found a way through.

15:52.333 --> 15:55.958
It wasn't easy to see, but we had to try.
I went for a reason.

15:56.458 --> 15:58.500
So where were you then, Inoue?

15:59.500 --> 16:00.791
Come on, cheers.

16:01.333 --> 16:02.291
Hang on.

16:02.375 --> 16:06.083
Inoue handled things very well,
but I was always out ahead soâ€¦

16:06.583 --> 16:08.916
It's like you climbed the wall alone.

16:09.000 --> 16:11.541
Well no, but in some ways, yes.

16:11.625 --> 16:12.625
Habu.

16:12.708 --> 16:14.958
What? It's true.
I was in front the whole way.

16:25.791 --> 16:27.666
-What were you thinking?
-What?

16:27.750 --> 16:31.000
Learn to be less hard on your partners.
What about team spirit?

16:31.083 --> 16:33.791
I wasn't trying to criticize Inoue.
It's just thatâ€¦

16:34.791 --> 16:36.500
But you get why he's hurt?

16:36.583 --> 16:39.875
I explained what happened.
I can't help it if that's upsetting.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.458
He looks around, panicked.

16:43.208 --> 16:44.666
He can't find his keys.

16:44.750 --> 16:48.041
We looked everywhere. An hour later,
he found them in his pocket.

16:48.125 --> 16:48.958
You believe that?

16:50.333 --> 16:54.416
Speaking of the team,Â Buntaro won't stop
talking about climbing with you.

16:54.500 --> 16:57.541
No, no way.
He's too young. He'd slow me down.

16:58.208 --> 17:01.000
I know some young climbers
who do pretty well.

17:01.083 --> 17:02.916
One even sought me out one day,

17:03.000 --> 17:05.125
wanting to join the club,
but he was underage.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.250
What was it he said again?

17:07.333 --> 17:10.916
"Mr. Ito, please say yes.
Let me join your club."

17:12.583 --> 17:15.208
Come on, think about it. He'd love it.

17:15.791 --> 17:17.208
There's always risk.

17:17.291 --> 17:18.708
Imagine you're tied together.

17:18.791 --> 17:21.541
Your partner is hurt or unconscious.
He can't climb back up.

17:21.625 --> 17:23.750
He's swinging at the end of the rope.

17:23.833 --> 17:26.125
It's pulling you over.
You're in big trouble.

17:26.208 --> 17:28.708
What do you do?
Do you cut the rope or not?

17:28.791 --> 17:30.375
Just like that? I don't know.

17:31.166 --> 17:34.625
If you don't act quickly, you both fall.
You have to make a choice.

17:34.708 --> 17:37.416
I wouldn't cut the rope.
No way. I couldn't.

17:37.500 --> 17:40.708
If you were on the other end,
I wouldn't hesitate.

17:43.333 --> 17:44.458
I'd cut the rope.

17:48.833 --> 17:50.791
No point in both of you dying.

17:54.625 --> 17:58.875
What if you were at the end of the rope?
You'd want your partner to think twice.

17:58.958 --> 18:01.375
No, because there is no other solution.

18:04.208 --> 18:08.125
If I fall, don't think twice.
I wouldn't hold it against anyone.

18:11.333 --> 18:12.375
Another round?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.125
Yeah, sure.

18:21.791 --> 18:22.750
Habu?

18:23.916 --> 18:26.458
I wanted
to congratulate you on Demon Wall.

18:26.958 --> 18:28.791
Hase. Hase Tsuneo.

18:30.208 --> 18:31.041
Yesâ€¦

18:31.541 --> 18:33.666
The Takizawa Passage last summer?

18:34.208 --> 18:36.833
A new speed record? Well done.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.791
I'm glad to have run into you.
I'm curiousâ€¦

18:41.875 --> 18:44.416
There aren't many rock faces like that,
even in Europe.

18:44.916 --> 18:46.916
How did you go about it? Tell me.

18:48.833 --> 18:50.375
Ever done a winter ascent?

18:53.708 --> 18:55.416
I didn't want to rush it.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.541
I set up the bivouac and I waited.

18:58.041 --> 19:01.500
I needed a nice day. The sun melts
the snow and clears the route.

19:25.125 --> 19:26.916
The last passage is technical.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.666
You mustn't slow your pace,
but well, you know all about speed.

19:31.208 --> 19:32.666
Thanks for the advice.

19:33.708 --> 19:35.333
Gonna attempt Demon Wall?

19:36.791 --> 19:38.375
Yeah, I leave tomorrow.

19:41.000 --> 19:42.750
That's good. With who?

19:46.500 --> 19:48.083
No one. I'm going alone.

20:02.291 --> 20:04.791
<i>And now, the sporting event of the week.</i>

20:04.875 --> 20:06.875
<i>Yes, and that's no exaggeration.</i>

20:06.958 --> 20:09.666
<i>The up-and-coming young climber,</i>
<i>Hase Tsuneo,</i>

20:09.750 --> 20:13.708
<i>has just scaled the notorious Demon Wall,</i>
<i>in winter, alone.</i>

20:13.791 --> 20:14.625
<i>A first.</i>

20:14.708 --> 20:17.333
<i>The Demon Wall alone?Â That's incredible!</i>

20:17.416 --> 20:20.708
<i>I don't think he'll stop there.</i>
<i>You'll be hearing a lot more about him!</i>

20:20.791 --> 20:23.291
<i>Hase Tsuneo, the climber to watch.</i>

20:23.375 --> 20:24.625
<i>Now the baseball results.</i>

20:24.708 --> 20:27.666
<i>The Osaka Buffaloes</i>
<i>have just qualified for the Pacific League</i>

20:27.750 --> 20:31.500
<i>with two exceptional strikeouts</i>
<i>by Sakamura, the new recruitâ€¦</i>

20:44.541 --> 20:46.583
HABU JOJI

21:04.041 --> 21:04.958
A week?

21:05.541 --> 21:07.250
Just out of the blue like this?

21:07.333 --> 21:09.583
Are you crazy? And to do what exactly?

21:10.125 --> 21:12.375
To go to the mountains. Please.

21:12.458 --> 21:14.750
To the mountains? I must be dreaming.

21:15.250 --> 21:17.583
No. I need the manpower here. No way.

21:17.666 --> 21:20.500
Back to work.
There are three trucks to unload.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.083
I quit.

21:49.250 --> 21:51.916
-Tell him I'm in a meeting.
-Very well, sir.

21:58.875 --> 22:00.333
No, I did like him.

22:00.416 --> 22:03.291
But he was soâ€¦ How can I put this?

22:03.375 --> 22:06.791
He didn't know when to stop.
He always had to be climbing.

22:07.541 --> 22:10.041
I almost got fired because of him once.

22:10.125 --> 22:12.291
Is that why you stopped going with him?

22:13.833 --> 22:16.375
No. Over time,
I finally realized something.

22:17.166 --> 22:19.125
His climbing partners
didn't count for much.

22:19.208 --> 22:20.583
Me no more than anyone else.

22:21.083 --> 22:24.083
We were there
to help him climb higher. That's all.

22:24.583 --> 22:27.083
I didn't want to spend
my whole life behind him.

22:27.166 --> 22:28.250
So I stopped.

22:29.250 --> 22:30.166
After that,

22:31.333 --> 22:33.750
there weren't many people left
to climb with him.

22:40.916 --> 22:42.500
Mr. Habu!

22:43.916 --> 22:44.916
Mr. Habu.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.416
Buntaro, how are you?

22:47.333 --> 22:48.291
Hello, Ryoko.

22:48.375 --> 22:51.416
Sorry, Mr. Habu.
I didn't want him to bother you.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.083
Off to climb the Wind Walls?

22:53.750 --> 22:56.166
Let me climb with you.
I'll do whatever you say!

22:57.083 --> 22:59.666
What will Inoue say if you replace him?

23:00.333 --> 23:01.708
He'll be here soon.

23:02.708 --> 23:04.750
I know you don't have a partner.

23:05.291 --> 23:06.791
Let me come, please.

23:08.833 --> 23:13.041
You're not ready for a route like this.
It's too technical. I can't take you.

23:17.958 --> 23:20.291
I've been training for weeks.
I've improved.

23:22.958 --> 23:26.166
The holds are barely visible.
The rock is friable. It's too dangerous.

23:26.750 --> 23:29.250
Be sensible and go home.
Your sister's waiting for you.

23:31.166 --> 23:32.791
I'll go alone, then.

23:41.875 --> 23:42.916
Hey, Buntaro!

23:49.791 --> 23:51.125
Ever climbed a climbing wall?

23:57.208 --> 23:59.750
You have a hold on your right. Higher!

24:01.583 --> 24:02.583
There you go!

24:04.791 --> 24:06.166
Keep going, that's it.

24:13.416 --> 24:14.541
You have improved.

24:14.625 --> 24:16.750
-Thank you, Mr. Habu.
-No, really.

24:16.833 --> 24:19.166
You managed well. It wasn't easy.

24:19.250 --> 24:20.875
I have a good teacher.

24:21.375 --> 24:23.916
I think I could climb anywhere with you.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.875
The Alps, even the Himalayas!

24:25.958 --> 24:28.208
We could climb Everest together!

24:28.291 --> 24:31.041
Yeah, we have
to get past this overhang first.

24:31.833 --> 24:33.666
Can't loll if we want to be home early.

24:33.750 --> 24:36.000
You're a bit too young for a bivouac.

25:12.916 --> 25:14.875
Well done. You're past the worst.

25:15.500 --> 25:18.291
I managed to get all but two. I'm sorry.

25:18.375 --> 25:20.041
We have enough left.

25:20.541 --> 25:23.208
There's another small slope
then it gets easier.

25:23.708 --> 25:24.791
Want a break?

25:25.291 --> 25:28.166
No, I'll be fine. We'll rest afterwards.

25:29.333 --> 25:30.333
Okay, back to it.

25:31.291 --> 25:32.166
Here.

25:53.583 --> 25:55.041
Give me some slack!

26:10.583 --> 26:11.500
Buntaro!

26:15.791 --> 26:17.375
Buntaro, can you hear me?

26:22.750 --> 26:24.208
Buntaro, answer me!

26:29.541 --> 26:30.541
I'm here!

26:31.125 --> 26:32.166
Are you hurt?

26:33.208 --> 26:34.291
My leg!

26:36.041 --> 26:37.750
Can you reach the rock face?

26:37.833 --> 26:40.250
Sorry, Habu. I'm sorry.

26:41.083 --> 26:42.958
Can you reach the rock face?

26:44.666 --> 26:45.500
No.

26:46.125 --> 26:47.250
It's too far away!

26:52.000 --> 26:55.125
Okay. Can you climb back up
with a Prusik knot?

27:37.333 --> 27:38.208
Right.

27:38.958 --> 27:40.791
It's okay. We're both secured.

27:42.208 --> 27:44.208
Buntaro! Can you hear me?

27:44.958 --> 27:45.791
Yes!

27:48.875 --> 27:50.000
I'm sorry.

27:52.250 --> 27:53.250
It's my fault.

27:53.750 --> 27:55.333
I'll try and pull you up.

28:21.333 --> 28:23.416
Buntaro, the rope is fraying
against the rock.

28:24.333 --> 28:26.083
If I keep going, it'll break.

29:16.208 --> 29:18.791
I'm sorry! I wasn't good enough!

29:22.125 --> 29:24.916
Stop talking nonsense!
You're doing really well!

29:25.625 --> 29:27.708
We'll find a solution. You'll see.

29:32.250 --> 29:34.625
When this is over, we'll go to the Alps.

29:36.083 --> 29:37.000
Both of us.

29:38.083 --> 29:39.000
Yes, we'll go.

29:39.583 --> 29:40.625
We'll go, yes.

29:42.291 --> 29:43.166
I promise.

30:12.500 --> 30:13.750
Forgive me, Buntaro.

30:14.583 --> 30:15.583
Forgive me.

30:18.875 --> 30:20.041
Buntaro!

30:22.333 --> 30:24.625
No!

30:29.708 --> 30:30.625
No!

30:31.583 --> 30:33.000
Buntaro!

30:40.083 --> 30:42.458
Come with us, madam.

32:18.750 --> 32:20.708
There was no name, just money.

32:21.291 --> 32:24.291
-But I knew right away that it was him.
-He felt guilty.

32:24.375 --> 32:26.375
For what? My brother's death?

32:28.125 --> 32:29.833
At the time, I wanted him to.

32:30.333 --> 32:34.541
It was easier,
but I realized that no one was to blame.

32:35.208 --> 32:37.333
Buntaro insisted on going with him.

32:37.833 --> 32:40.125
You can't stop someone
from doing what they want.

32:40.208 --> 32:42.958
Even if it's senseless.
Even if it's dangerous.

32:46.250 --> 32:48.083
He was fascinated with Habu.

32:48.750 --> 32:52.500
He wanted to do everything he did.
He was like him, actually.

32:53.625 --> 32:56.625
He always had to be climbing,
going higher,

32:57.125 --> 32:58.000
and for what?

32:59.166 --> 33:02.250
Anyway, the letters kept coming
for a few years.

33:02.333 --> 33:05.541
First from Japan, then from Nepal.
But nothing for three years.

33:05.625 --> 33:09.500
From Nepal? Do you have an address,
anything that could help me find him?

33:09.583 --> 33:12.500
Never an address,
never a note, never a signature.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.666
I'm sorry, I can't help you.

33:16.041 --> 33:16.875
Wellâ€¦

33:19.666 --> 33:21.083
Actually, you never said.

33:21.583 --> 33:24.083
Why are you looking for Habu?
For an article?

33:24.166 --> 33:26.958
He might be able
to give us important information aboutâ€¦

33:27.041 --> 33:28.125
About?

33:28.208 --> 33:30.583
You know the first ascent of Everest
was in '53?

33:30.666 --> 33:31.750
No.

33:32.708 --> 33:33.916
Well, anyway,

33:34.000 --> 33:36.625
there's another mountaineer who may haveâ€¦

33:38.000 --> 33:39.250
Forget about it.

33:40.250 --> 33:43.375
I hope you find
what you're looking for. Goodbye.

33:46.000 --> 33:47.041
I hope so, too.

33:48.083 --> 33:48.958
Oh, yeah.

33:49.458 --> 33:52.125
There was a note with the last letter.
It was the only one.

33:52.208 --> 33:56.500
And he said that he wouldn't be able
to continue from where he was going,

33:56.583 --> 33:58.458
and that he was sorry. There.

34:27.416 --> 34:28.500

45:26.708 --> 45:29.875
That's why he left,
to also complete the southwest face.

45:30.458 --> 45:33.583
-Seriously? No one can do that in winter.
-He can.

45:33.666 --> 45:35.375
Maybe, but he hasn't.

45:35.458 --> 45:37.708
And you haven't found the camera.

45:38.666 --> 45:40.375
He's not the type to give up.

45:40.458 --> 45:43.625
He's too old now.
And no one would sponsor him.

45:43.708 --> 45:47.250
I called the Kathmandu tourist office.
They issue the climbing permits.

45:47.333 --> 45:50.041
-Habu applied three years ago.
-For the southwest face?

45:50.125 --> 45:52.750
I don't know,
but the application was denied.

45:53.291 --> 45:56.000
They forbid him
from doing something dangerous.

45:56.833 --> 45:58.750
-What are you playing at?
-What?

45:58.833 --> 46:00.250
No one's seen you in a month.

46:00.333 --> 46:03.916
You're shut away with your papers,
your records, making calls left and right.

46:04.000 --> 46:07.041
You know everything about him,
but you'll never find him.

46:07.125 --> 46:10.208
-He must be somewhere, right?
-You have no leads.

46:10.708 --> 46:13.916
Do me a favor,
forget Habu and this camera business.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.625
Stick to what you know,
taking great photos.

46:16.708 --> 46:18.333
That's what people want.

47:13.875 --> 47:14.750
Hello?

47:15.375 --> 47:16.375
Yes, it's me.

47:17.416 --> 47:19.250
Sure. I can be there tomorrow.

47:21.208 --> 47:23.833
Was my Everest story intriguing?
Want the rest?

47:23.916 --> 47:26.166
You told it so well.

47:27.625 --> 47:31.625
No, I found Habu's last letter.
The one with the note.

47:32.125 --> 47:34.250
Turns out I did keep it. Andâ€¦

47:34.333 --> 47:37.541
-Do you have an address?
-No, but I noticed something.

47:38.041 --> 47:38.875
Look.

47:39.375 --> 47:42.875
The other letters came from Kathmandu,
but this one came from somewhere else.

47:42.958 --> 47:45.000
I thought it might be of interest to you.

47:45.541 --> 47:46.500
Namche Bazaar.

47:47.083 --> 47:48.208
Do you know it?

47:48.291 --> 47:50.541
It's the last village before Everest.

47:50.625 --> 47:52.958
He may still be there, three years later.

49:05.750 --> 49:07.916
<i>To reach Everest, there's only one road</i>

49:08.000 --> 49:10.541
<i>and a week's walk</i>
<i>across the Khumbu valley.</i>

49:10.625 --> 49:11.708
<i>Sherpa country.</i>

49:14.583 --> 49:17.500
<i>Habu had vanished.</i>
<i>No one knew what became of him.</i>

49:18.083 --> 49:21.041
<i>But if he was still in the area,</i>
<i>I would find him.</i>

51:12.625 --> 51:13.625
Anyone there?

51:18.083 --> 51:19.666
Hello, is anyone there?

51:29.000 --> 51:30.250
What are you up to?

51:38.791 --> 51:42.208
Hello, I'm a journalist.
I work for a Japanese magazine.

51:42.291 --> 51:43.416
I'm Fukamachi.

51:46.333 --> 51:49.250
-Go away, Fukamachi.
-I won't be here for long.

51:49.333 --> 51:52.333
-I want to ask some questions to prepare--
-Nothing to say.

51:52.416 --> 51:54.583
I saw you in Kathmandu with that guy.

51:54.666 --> 51:57.875
The camera's a Vest Pocket.
Did you find it on Everest?

51:58.375 --> 52:01.333
-Because that means it's--
-What? Leave me alone.

52:02.583 --> 52:04.083
This winter you plan

52:04.166 --> 52:06.333
to climb Everest's southwest face.

52:06.416 --> 52:08.791
I just want to cover the ascent.

52:08.875 --> 52:10.625
Let me follow you. I'll hang back.

52:10.708 --> 52:13.875
You won't even see me.
I'll just take photos.

52:15.333 --> 52:18.000
If you go alone and you succeed,
no one will ever know.

52:18.083 --> 52:21.333
Is that what you want?
You need proof of the ascent.

52:21.416 --> 52:22.625
You need me.

52:23.666 --> 52:25.875
I don't need anyone. Now, clear off.

52:25.958 --> 52:28.791
Let me climb with you.
I'll do whatever you say!

52:33.916 --> 52:37.625
You're too late.
I stopped long ago. That's all over now.

52:37.708 --> 52:39.208
No, wait. Don't do that.

52:39.291 --> 52:40.500
It's over. Got it?

52:40.583 --> 52:41.416
-But--
-Get lost!

52:45.916 --> 52:47.083
Okay.

53:06.750 --> 53:08.333
I know you still climb.

53:08.416 --> 53:11.041
You can't stop me from coming.
I'll be there. You hear me?

53:11.125 --> 53:14.125
I'll be waiting for you
at base camp this winter.

53:30.333 --> 53:33.500
<i>Mountain climbing was long</i>
<i>a competition for climbing the highest.</i>

53:34.083 --> 53:37.291
<i>Once the summit is reached,</i>
<i>you might think the competition's over.</i>

53:37.791 --> 53:39.041
<i>It doesn't work like that.</i>

53:41.000 --> 53:43.291
<i>A mountaineer always finds new challenges.</i>

53:43.375 --> 53:46.125
<i>If not higher,</i>
<i>they'll seek the most difficult route,</i>

53:46.208 --> 53:49.416
<i>they'll climb faster,</i>
<i>solo, without oxygen.</i>

53:50.333 --> 53:51.916
<i>Basically, it never ends.</i>

53:53.916 --> 53:56.250
<i>Everest was conquered in '53</i>
<i>from the Nepalese side,</i>

53:57.125 --> 53:58.458
<i>without oxygen in '78,</i>

53:59.583 --> 54:02.250
<i>two years later,</i>
<i>solo via the Norton Couloir.</i>

54:10.250 --> 54:13.791
<i>In the winter of '85,</i>
<i>Hase tackled the dangerous southwest face.</i>

54:14.916 --> 54:16.291
<i>He would never make it back.</i>

54:21.583 --> 54:24.125
<i>So the southwest face</i>
<i>in winter remains unconquered.</i>

54:24.208 --> 54:27.333
<i>Habu was going to tackle it alone,</i>
<i>without oxygen.</i>

54:29.333 --> 54:31.625
<i>An exploit I wouldn't miss for the world.</i>

55:34.666 --> 55:37.291
-What's the weather forecast?
-We must wait.

55:37.375 --> 55:40.375
With the wind, the clouds
are gathering on the peaks.

55:40.458 --> 55:41.791
It'll snow again soon.

55:41.875 --> 55:44.458
We can't leave for three days. Maybe four.

55:44.541 --> 55:47.666
Plus another day for it to settle.
We'll wait.

55:52.625 --> 55:55.583
How long do you think
the ascent will take? A week?

55:55.666 --> 55:58.083
-Three nights and four days.
-Is that possible?

55:58.166 --> 55:59.833
That's the only way it's possible.

56:07.625 --> 56:12.208
Do you know the rules of a solo climb?
No communication, no interventions.

56:12.875 --> 56:16.250
You take your photos, that's it.
If I'm having trouble, you stay put.

56:16.750 --> 56:19.416
If you're in trouble,
don't count on me. Got it?

56:19.500 --> 56:20.333
Yes.

56:24.500 --> 56:25.666
Okay, good night.

56:36.833 --> 56:38.666
Don't be too quick to judge him.

56:39.166 --> 56:41.666
He'll have been here for eight years soon.

56:41.750 --> 56:44.458
He's been preparing for eight years.
It's all he lives for.

56:44.958 --> 56:46.916
This ascent is everything to him.

56:47.000 --> 56:49.666
He won't let anyone stand in his way.

56:49.750 --> 56:51.083
I don't intend to.

56:51.166 --> 56:52.500
I know.

56:53.291 --> 56:54.750
It's good you're here.

56:55.708 --> 56:57.041
He'll never admit it,

56:57.125 --> 56:59.333
but he'll need your photos
if he does succeed.

57:00.083 --> 57:01.583
But you're not like him.

57:01.666 --> 57:03.541
Your limits aren't his limits.

57:03.625 --> 57:05.833
Don't try to follow him at all costs.

57:05.916 --> 57:09.458
If you feel you can't go on, don't.
Come back down.

57:09.541 --> 57:14.208
You know, from 7,500 m because of a lack
of oxygen, you'll have headaches

57:14.291 --> 57:16.208
and find it hard to keep going.

57:16.916 --> 57:17.916
That's normal.

57:19.250 --> 57:21.333
Above 8,000 m, you're in the death zone.

57:21.416 --> 57:24.250
The body wasn't made
to survive at that altitude.

57:24.833 --> 57:27.375
You have to move quickly
or you won't come back.

57:27.458 --> 57:28.416
Understand?

57:29.083 --> 57:30.083
I understand.

58:42.916 --> 58:43.875
Are you ready?

58:45.958 --> 58:46.958
What about you?

58:47.875 --> 58:48.875
I think so.

58:50.625 --> 58:52.416
What you're doing is risky.

58:52.958 --> 58:54.916
There'd be no point if it wasn't.

58:55.500 --> 58:59.250
Why are you doing it?
Hase is dead, the competition's over.

58:59.333 --> 59:01.666
Why do you insist on following me?

59:01.750 --> 59:05.541
For a few photos in a magazine?
For the price of an article? Why?

59:07.166 --> 59:08.375
There's more to it.

59:10.166 --> 59:13.291
Once you get a taste for it,
nothing else matters.

59:15.000 --> 59:16.083
That's how it is.

59:24.375 --> 59:25.833
Did you find it here?

59:26.333 --> 59:29.375
Was the camera on Everest?
Is it really the cameraâ€¦

59:29.458 --> 59:32.416
You're pissing me off with your questions.
It's no one's camera.

59:34.250 --> 59:36.208
Prepare your bag. We leave tomorrow.

1:07:29.916 --> 1:07:30.875
Come on.

1:07:47.500 --> 1:07:48.416
Habu.

1:08:36.458 --> 1:08:37.416
Oh no.

1:08:44.208 --> 1:08:45.125
Come on.

1:09:20.916 --> 1:09:22.750
<i>Habu, how are you? Sleep well?</i>

1:09:22.833 --> 1:09:24.958
I'm fine. It was a peaceful night.

1:09:25.041 --> 1:09:26.833
<i>Lucky. There were strong gales here</i>.

1:09:26.916 --> 1:09:28.208
<i>Are you on schedule?</i>

1:09:28.708 --> 1:09:30.500
I leave at 6.00 a.m. as planned.

1:09:30.583 --> 1:09:31.750
If the weather holds,

1:09:31.833 --> 1:09:35.083
I should pass Warship Rock easily
and be at the Grey Tower by nightfall.

1:09:35.166 --> 1:09:38.500
<i>Okay. Let me know</i>
<i>of any changes. Good luck!</i>

1:10:46.250 --> 1:10:48.375
<i>Habu, do you read me?</i>

1:10:48.458 --> 1:10:50.083
<i>I read you. What is it?</i>

1:10:50.625 --> 1:10:52.375
<i>The weather's turning.</i>

1:10:52.458 --> 1:10:55.625
<i>A storm's building at the southern pass</i>
<i>with gusts of 200 km.</i>

1:10:55.708 --> 1:10:58.958
<i>-It's headed for you. Don't hang around.</i>
<i>-Copy that.</i>

1:11:03.041 --> 1:11:04.083
Shit!

1:13:11.666 --> 1:13:12.708
Come on!

1:13:14.875 --> 1:13:16.333
Come on, move!

1:14:39.291 --> 1:14:41.041
Fukamachi!

1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:44.000
Hey! Fuckamachi! Wake up!

1:14:44.083 --> 1:14:46.500
How are you feeling?
Do you think you can climb?

1:14:46.583 --> 1:14:49.541
-Leave me.
-Don't argue. Take off your rucksack.

1:14:49.625 --> 1:14:52.875
-No!
-Give me your ax. It's in the way.

1:14:52.958 --> 1:14:55.750
Take off your ice crampons.
Leave things to me!

1:14:55.833 --> 1:14:58.833
Stop, you won't make it!
We'll both get stuck here!

1:14:58.916 --> 1:15:00.791
Hold on tight. It'll be okay.

1:16:00.375 --> 1:16:01.208
Drink.

1:16:05.625 --> 1:16:07.166
Sorry, it's my fault.

1:16:09.708 --> 1:16:11.500
Drink, you need to rehydrate.

1:16:29.250 --> 1:16:31.041
Why did you come to save me?

1:16:31.541 --> 1:16:33.083
We said no interventions.

1:16:34.083 --> 1:16:37.000
You're not saved.
You still have to get down.

1:16:37.083 --> 1:16:39.250
If it doesn't ease off, it'll be hard.

1:16:40.958 --> 1:16:42.041
So it's over?

1:16:43.416 --> 1:16:45.750
We lost too much time.
The window is too short.

1:16:46.541 --> 1:16:48.875
The only way is to take the Yellow Band.

1:16:48.958 --> 1:16:51.458
No. It's too exposed at this time of year.

1:16:51.958 --> 1:16:53.458
And the rock is fragile.

1:16:53.541 --> 1:16:55.666
You don't have enough rope. It'sâ€¦

1:16:56.166 --> 1:16:57.250
Impossible.

1:16:58.666 --> 1:16:59.666
We stop here.

1:17:07.166 --> 1:17:08.291
Draw your legs in.

1:17:23.208 --> 1:17:24.458
I found it up there.

1:17:24.541 --> 1:17:25.583
Near the ridge.

1:17:28.208 --> 1:17:29.208
The camera.

1:17:34.500 --> 1:17:37.583
<i>I attempted the southwest face</i>
<i>several times, but always failed.</i>

1:17:38.916 --> 1:17:43.250
<i>Last winter, conditions were bad.</i>
<i>After the Grey Tower, I lost my bearings.</i>

1:17:43.958 --> 1:17:47.000
<i>The summit was so close</i>,
<i>but it was impossible to find a route.</i>

1:17:48.083 --> 1:17:51.500
<i>I was exhausted. I was searching</i>
<i>for somewhere to take shelter.</i>

1:17:52.916 --> 1:17:53.916
<i>He was there.</i>

1:18:23.416 --> 1:18:24.583
<i>And you think thatâ€¦</i>

1:18:25.083 --> 1:18:28.208
<i>That he reached the summit?</i>
<i>You'll be disappointed.</i>

1:18:28.958 --> 1:18:31.708
<i>He was last seen at around 8,700 m.</i>

1:18:32.666 --> 1:18:37.583
<i>I found him a little higher up. Can't say</i>
<i>whether he was ascending or descending.</i>

1:18:37.666 --> 1:18:39.458
<i>We could find out from the film.</i>

1:18:44.916 --> 1:18:46.291
<i>What does it matter?</i>

1:19:36.083 --> 1:19:36.916
Thank you.

1:19:38.791 --> 1:19:39.875
Shall we head off?

1:19:43.750 --> 1:19:44.750
Be careful.

1:19:46.875 --> 1:19:50.541
The storm may return,
gusts might strengthen after the couloir.

1:19:51.041 --> 1:19:52.416
And I won't be there.

1:19:52.500 --> 1:19:54.041
Wait, you're not going toâ€¦

1:19:54.125 --> 1:19:57.500
You need to reach the valley by noon.
Don't hang around.

1:24:02.791 --> 1:24:03.750
Are you okay?

1:24:04.250 --> 1:24:06.291
I'm okay. Has Habu come back?

1:24:06.791 --> 1:24:07.791
Not yet.

1:24:07.875 --> 1:24:08.875
Did he make it?

1:24:08.958 --> 1:24:12.625
I don't know. The last radio contact
we had was yesterday morning.

1:24:13.125 --> 1:24:15.416
He was going to tackle the summit.
He sounded well.

1:24:15.500 --> 1:24:16.708
Nothing since then.

1:25:08.333 --> 1:25:09.583
Something's not right.

1:25:10.208 --> 1:25:14.041
He might be stranded by the bad weather.
We have to wait.

1:26:10.583 --> 1:26:11.583
One more day.

1:26:12.083 --> 1:26:12.916
Just one.

1:26:13.416 --> 1:26:15.416
There's no point. It's over.

1:26:16.291 --> 1:26:17.166
Come on.

1:26:38.083 --> 1:26:39.875
He asked me to give you this.

1:27:05.000 --> 1:27:07.958
<i>If you're reading this,</i>
<i>I didn't make it back.</i>

1:27:08.750 --> 1:27:10.041
<i>Keep the camera.</i>

1:27:10.958 --> 1:27:13.541
<i>It may tell you</i>
<i>what you want to know about Mallory</i>

1:27:13.625 --> 1:27:15.708
<i>so you can see your work</i>
<i>through to the end.</i>

1:27:15.791 --> 1:27:18.416
<i>But if you're wondering why he did it,</i>

1:27:19.500 --> 1:27:21.000
<i>why I'm doing this,</i>

1:27:22.583 --> 1:27:24.250
<i>you won't find the answer there.</i>

1:27:25.333 --> 1:27:27.291
<i>As you're here, you must have an idea.</i>

1:27:28.291 --> 1:27:31.750
<i>Whatever brought you here</i>
<i>is the same thing that drives me to climb.</i>

1:27:33.166 --> 1:27:34.583
<i>I don't know what it is.</i>

1:27:35.125 --> 1:27:39.041
<i>I stopped asking myself that when</i>
<i>I realized I couldn't live without it.</i>

1:27:41.875 --> 1:27:45.000
<i>Some people search</i>
<i>for meaning in their lives. Not me.</i>

1:27:45.833 --> 1:27:48.916
<i>Climbing is the only thing</i>
<i>that makes me feel alive.</i>

1:27:49.416 --> 1:27:51.625
<i>So I did it right to the end.</i>

1:27:52.791 --> 1:27:53.833
<i>No regrets.</i>

1:29:26.333 --> 1:29:27.416
<i>Habu was right.</i>

1:29:28.166 --> 1:29:32.041
<i>I had the answer to the Mallory mystery,</i>
<i>and yet it wasn't enough.</i>

1:29:33.416 --> 1:29:35.375
<i>Why everÂ climb higher?</i>

1:29:35.875 --> 1:29:36.916
<i>To be the first?</i>

1:29:37.791 --> 1:29:40.375
<i>Why risk death?</i>
<i>Why do something so futile?</i>

1:29:58.083 --> 1:29:59.375
<i>I know why now.</i>

1:30:00.750 --> 1:30:02.458
<i>There doesn't have to be a reason.</i>

1:30:03.625 --> 1:30:06.250
<i>For some, the mountains</i>
<i>aren't a goal, but a path.</i>

1:30:06.333 --> 1:30:07.750
<i>And the summit, a step.</i>

1:30:09.250 --> 1:30:11.875
<i>Once there,</i>
<i>all that's left is to keep going.</i>

1:34:15.625 --> 1:34:20.625
