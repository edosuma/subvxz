00:03.350 --> 00:06.842
Give us the serum, Mr. Bannon.

00:06.887 --> 00:11.722
It belongs to our master... Nat King Cobra.

00:27.674 --> 00:29.938
You suck!

00:33.714 --> 00:36.774
Sorry to have to leave
the party early, gentlemen...

00:36.817 --> 00:38.580
not that it hasn't been a...

00:38.618 --> 00:39.778
blast.

00:46.226 --> 00:47.591
Blast.

00:47.627 --> 00:49.060
Good one, Race.

00:51.264 --> 00:53.630
Hey. Check it out... skywriting.

00:53.667 --> 00:55.134
Where?

00:56.336 --> 00:57.803
Dude.

00:57.838 --> 00:59.135
Dude!

02:07.140 --> 02:08.630
Jeez.

02:08.675 --> 02:12.736
I never thought I'd see the day
I'd be working for Professor lmpossible.

02:12.779 --> 02:15.509
Me neither.
This is a dream come true.

02:15.549 --> 02:18.177
No. I meant
'cause he flunked me in college.

02:18.218 --> 02:19.981
Hey, didn't he flunk you, too?

02:20.020 --> 02:21.647
Squeaked by with a sympathy "D."

02:21.688 --> 02:23.280
My dad died that semester.

02:23.323 --> 02:24.722
Hey. What's my sosh?

02:24.758 --> 02:25.747
How should I know?

02:25.792 --> 02:27.623
He thinks he's so fantastic.

02:27.661 --> 02:30.789
All he does is go on and on
about himself and his inventions.

02:30.831 --> 02:34.824
Welcome to lmpossible Industries,
gentlemen.

02:34.868 --> 02:39.032
I know the journey here was quite long,
but I trust you all had a pleasant one.

02:39.072 --> 02:41.165
How should we know?
We were blindfolded.

02:41.208 --> 02:45.770
Yes. I'm sorry about that,
but since this think tank is a joint effort...

02:45.812 --> 02:48.110
of lmpossible Industries
and the government...

02:48.148 --> 02:51.675
the strictest security measures
have to be followed at all times.

02:51.718 --> 02:55.176
I see you've already been issued
your required "l" suits.

02:55.222 --> 02:57.622
Yeah. I notice you're not wearing one.

02:57.657 --> 02:59.124
How silly of me.

02:59.159 --> 03:00.626
That's better.

03:00.660 --> 03:02.924
Had a lunch
with the National Security Council.

03:02.963 --> 03:04.897
So, how do they fit...

03:04.931 --> 03:06.660
Impossibly great, right?

03:06.700 --> 03:09.464
It is the most comfortable thing
I've ever worn.

03:09.503 --> 03:13.234
It's like wearing nothing at all,
like a second skin.

03:13.273 --> 03:15.969
You've got a little something brown
on your nose.

03:16.009 --> 03:19.035
Speaking of skin, you know, the "l" suits...

03:19.079 --> 03:21.741
actually recycle dead skin cells
as you shed them...

03:21.781 --> 03:24.579
which then fuel
the in-suit air conditioning...

03:24.618 --> 03:27.951
that keeps them a constant
comfortable seventy degrees.

03:27.988 --> 03:31.116
Yeah. Well, that's all well and good,
but mine fits for crap.

03:31.157 --> 03:32.249
My apologies.

03:32.292 --> 03:33.281
Here.

03:34.294 --> 03:35.420
There.

03:35.462 --> 03:36.895
How's that feel?

03:38.298 --> 03:40.163
Impossibly great.

03:40.200 --> 03:42.134
Thanks.

03:42.168 --> 03:45.660
They conform to your body's every contour
and every movement...

03:45.705 --> 03:48.230
even my impossible movements.

03:48.275 --> 03:50.607
They're hypoallergenic
and help keep the labs...

03:50.644 --> 03:53.579
free from dander and unwanted body hair.

03:53.613 --> 03:55.945
Oh, OK, already.
Great. Wow.

03:55.982 --> 03:57.711
You invented thermal underwear.

03:57.751 --> 03:59.685
Whoop-dee-freakin'-do.

03:59.719 --> 04:03.382
So, uh, Professor,
with the "l" suits here...

04:03.423 --> 04:05.721
how does one, you know?

04:05.759 --> 04:07.226
Go to the bathroom?

04:07.260 --> 04:08.887
It takes some getting used to...

04:08.929 --> 04:11.295
but now's the perfect time
to start practicing.

04:11.331 --> 04:13.424
Um, what?

04:13.466 --> 04:14.990
Mandatory drug testing.

04:15.035 --> 04:16.969
Company policy.

04:17.003 --> 04:20.063
All you do is think
about going to the bathroom...

04:20.106 --> 04:23.075
and the "l" suit does the rest.

04:26.446 --> 04:27.811
It works.

04:27.847 --> 04:29.178
Incredible.

04:31.251 --> 04:32.377
How about that?

04:33.920 --> 04:37.083
I'm not wearing any underwear.

04:37.123 --> 04:39.648
What are we looking for?

04:39.693 --> 04:42.127
Clues, anything out of the ordinary...

04:42.162 --> 04:43.754
besides...

04:43.797 --> 04:47.028
you know, a burnt-out plane
full of snake men.

04:47.067 --> 04:50.764
Brock, I think I figured out
why the plane crashed.

04:50.804 --> 04:53.364
There were skeletons driving it!

04:53.406 --> 04:56.603
That's, uh, nice work, Dean.

04:58.645 --> 05:01.205
Boys, we've got an agent M.I.A.

05:01.247 --> 05:04.011
Better come with me
while I search the area.

05:04.050 --> 05:06.245
No telling whether or not more of these...

05:06.286 --> 05:08.379
snake guys are gonna show up.

05:08.421 --> 05:12.118
You mean, go with you
on a bona fide spy mission?

05:12.158 --> 05:13.386
Proper!

05:13.426 --> 05:15.087
Let's go change into spy clothes.

05:26.039 --> 05:27.404
He's gonna fire me.

05:27.440 --> 05:29.237
I had a cold last week,
and I took cough medicine.

05:29.275 --> 05:31.140
What if he finds codeine in my sample?

05:31.177 --> 05:32.872
He's gonna think I'm a junkie, fire me.

05:32.912 --> 05:35.437
Relax, Billy. You'll be fine.

05:35.482 --> 05:39.077
It's Venture and his mother's little helpers
that should be worried.

05:39.119 --> 05:41.815
Thanks for your concern, White,
but I've got it covered.

05:41.855 --> 05:44.653
At least my sons finally proved themselves
useful for something.

05:44.691 --> 05:47.251
"Company policy, company policy."

05:47.293 --> 05:49.318
Anal retentive weird... oh!

05:49.362 --> 05:50.386
Oh, my God.

05:50.430 --> 05:52.091
Uh, just... OK.

05:57.037 --> 05:59.437
Nice spy clothes, douche.

05:59.472 --> 06:01.633
What? I didn't have any black.

06:01.675 --> 06:03.404
I figured, "cowboy."

06:03.443 --> 06:05.877
Next best thing to spies, right?

06:15.588 --> 06:17.215
Wow!

06:27.033 --> 06:29.331
What can I say?
I'm like a camel.

06:29.369 --> 06:32.395
Uh, Sally.

06:32.439 --> 06:37.342
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce
my lovely wife Sally.

06:37.377 --> 06:41.143
Whatever are you doing out of your room
during work hours, honey?

06:41.181 --> 06:42.739
I needed something from the kitchen.

06:42.782 --> 06:44.409
Well, all right.

06:44.451 --> 06:48.251
I'll allow it, but, please, next time,
just ask me to get it for you.

06:48.288 --> 06:50.415
- But you were busy.
- Sally.

06:50.457 --> 06:52.425
OK, Richard.
I'm sorry, Richard.

06:52.459 --> 06:54.290
Oh. And here.
Could you be a lark...

06:54.327 --> 06:58.320
and bring the gentlemen's samples
down to the lab for me?

06:59.933 --> 07:02.629
You make your wife stay in her room?

07:02.669 --> 07:06.036
I know how this looks,
but Sally has a...

07:06.072 --> 07:08.199
a medical condition.

07:08.241 --> 07:12.234
She's very sensitive to light
and shouldn't be out during the day.

07:12.278 --> 07:14.109
Hey, but there aren't any windows in here.

07:14.147 --> 07:15.546
OK. Tour's over.

07:15.582 --> 07:19.575
Let's get you fellows situated
at your work stations, shall we?

07:26.292 --> 07:28.157
D'oh! My Kuwahara!

07:34.868 --> 07:36.062
Oh, man.

07:36.102 --> 07:38.434
These are no good for you, kid.

07:41.708 --> 07:42.902
Beat it, junior.

07:42.942 --> 07:44.671
We're on official government business.

07:46.946 --> 07:48.345
Race Bannon.

07:48.381 --> 07:50.042
Those bastards killed him!

07:50.083 --> 07:51.243
Those kids?

07:51.284 --> 07:52.808
Damn it!
We let them go!

07:52.852 --> 07:54.251
You know him, Brock?

07:54.287 --> 07:56.084
Worked with him a few times.

07:56.122 --> 07:57.589
He was one of the best.

07:57.624 --> 07:59.285
Do you need a hug, Brock?

07:59.325 --> 08:00.587
No, Dean.

08:00.627 --> 08:01.685
Well...

08:01.728 --> 08:03.252
it's here if you need it.

08:05.865 --> 08:07.958
I know how it is in this line of work.

08:08.001 --> 08:10.834
See enough death,
and you start to get hard inside.

08:10.870 --> 08:12.428
Holy crap!

08:12.472 --> 08:15.373
Samson, is that you?

08:15.408 --> 08:16.602
Yes. I'm here, Race.

08:16.643 --> 08:19.271
Ah, you look nice.

08:19.312 --> 08:20.711
Listen...

08:20.747 --> 08:22.715
you... you have to...

08:22.749 --> 08:25.183
recover the canister.

08:25.218 --> 08:27.448
We have it, Race.
Tell me what it is.

08:27.487 --> 08:30.251
Goliath Serum.

08:30.290 --> 08:32.349
Here.

08:32.392 --> 08:33.984
Do me a favor, Brock.

08:34.027 --> 08:35.551
Anything, old friend.

08:37.197 --> 08:39.495
Tell... J...

08:39.532 --> 08:40.692
Jonny...

08:40.732 --> 08:41.893
I...

08:41.934 --> 08:45.098
Love... unh!

08:51.044 --> 08:52.909
I didn't know they...

08:52.946 --> 08:55.881
Yeah. They never show that part on TV.

08:55.915 --> 08:57.906
Come on, Venture, think, think, damn it!

08:57.951 --> 08:59.612
You can come up with something.

09:01.554 --> 09:03.715
Burning the midnight oil, I see.

09:03.756 --> 09:05.781
Well, this looks interesting.

09:05.825 --> 09:07.019
What you working on?

09:07.060 --> 09:08.960
Oh, this?
It's nothing really.

09:08.995 --> 09:10.963
Come on.
Give us a peek.

09:10.997 --> 09:13.397
Actually, it's quite technical.

09:13.433 --> 09:15.025
I am a scientist.

09:15.068 --> 09:16.399
Oh! Hold on!

09:16.436 --> 09:18.734
Sorry, Professor lmpossible.

09:18.771 --> 09:21.035
Listen. I can look at this later.

09:21.074 --> 09:27.035
I really just came by to remind you
that I need that sample from you A.S.A.P.

09:27.080 --> 09:28.911
Company policy.

09:30.450 --> 09:31.883
Hi.

09:31.918 --> 09:33.351
Oh. I brought you something.

09:33.386 --> 09:35.684
Oh. Is that your...?

09:35.722 --> 09:36.950
No.

09:36.990 --> 09:38.719
It's your...

09:40.460 --> 09:43.361
You might be able to fool Richard,
but not me.

09:43.396 --> 09:45.057
I have a prescription for those.

09:45.098 --> 09:46.258
I need them for my...

09:47.267 --> 09:48.894
You know what I need?

09:50.670 --> 09:54.834
The Goliath Serum developed
by Professor Richard lmpossible...

09:54.874 --> 09:58.571
for use during the Vietnam Conflict,
but rejected for production.

09:58.611 --> 10:02.240
Injected into a living creature,
it alters the subject's metabolism...

10:02.282 --> 10:06.981
turning it into a living, breathing
time bomb within twenty-four hours.

10:07.020 --> 10:09.887
The magnitude of the blast
is directly proportionate...

10:09.923 --> 10:11.413
to the subject's size.

10:11.457 --> 10:12.685
Why, if one drop...

10:12.725 --> 10:16.923
enough to turn this unsuspecting ant
into a six-legged miniature hand grenade...

10:16.963 --> 10:19.693
just imagine the devastation
that could be caused...

10:19.732 --> 10:23.998
if, say, an elephant was injected
with the Goliath Serum.

10:24.037 --> 10:28.269
Now imagine that elephant
was performing in the Moscow Circus.

10:28.308 --> 10:30.333
Watch out, lvan!

10:30.376 --> 10:33.311
The serum can enter the bloodstream
through the skin...

10:33.346 --> 10:35.314
so direct contact should be avoided.

10:35.348 --> 10:36.838
Take care when handling it.

10:36.883 --> 10:41.650
If you suspect unintentional exposure,
watch for the early warning signs.

10:41.688 --> 10:43.679
Does the patient look flushed?

10:43.723 --> 10:47.318
Does the patient have
an abnormally large appetite?

10:48.895 --> 10:50.123
What?

10:50.163 --> 10:52.188
Is there popcorn on my face?

10:54.334 --> 10:56.268
Oh, this feels so good.

10:56.302 --> 10:58.065
I haven't laughed like this in years.

10:58.104 --> 10:59.594
Richard never lets me drink.

10:59.639 --> 11:02.870
Ah, well, he's probably worried
about your medical condition.

11:02.909 --> 11:05.241
Medical condition?
He's worried I'll embarrass him...

11:05.278 --> 11:08.736
Mr. Big lmportant Science Man,
so prim and proper...

11:08.781 --> 11:11.579
all clean-cut and always
so damn calm and composed.

11:11.617 --> 11:14.745
He's like a robot.
It drives me nuts, but you...

11:14.787 --> 11:16.084
you're nothing like Richard.

11:16.122 --> 11:17.851
You're alive.

11:17.890 --> 11:19.323
Well, uh...

11:19.359 --> 11:22.590
You curse, you sweat,
you twitch, you have passion.

11:22.628 --> 11:24.755
I'm dying in this place, Venture.

11:24.797 --> 11:26.924
I want to taste real life again.

11:26.966 --> 11:30.094
Kiss me, Dr. Venture!

11:31.270 --> 11:32.635
Kiss me!

11:37.510 --> 11:39.205
Please, please, Dr. Venture.

11:39.245 --> 11:41.975
Get away from... oh, God! Help me.

11:42.014 --> 11:44.949
Billy, White, she's a succubus.

11:44.984 --> 11:47.214
Doctor, please.
Wait, don't.

11:50.923 --> 11:52.322
Dr. Venture.

11:58.931 --> 12:01.798
Oh, God! Oh, God!

12:01.834 --> 12:03.233
It burns! It burns!

12:07.106 --> 12:09.006
No! No! Oh, god!

12:17.950 --> 12:21.511
What, uh, doing here?

12:21.554 --> 12:23.351
Bad man make Cody cry hurt.

12:23.389 --> 12:24.754
I don't. I wasn't. I...

12:24.790 --> 12:27.987
Ned, don't. Dr. Venture is a friend.

12:30.129 --> 12:32.256
Bad man make Cody cry hurt.

12:32.298 --> 12:34.926
I know.
He didn't mean it, Ned.

12:34.967 --> 12:36.935
Ned hurt, too.

12:36.969 --> 12:39.096
Heart hurt. Body hurt.

12:39.138 --> 12:41.766
I know, Ned. I know.

12:43.042 --> 12:44.134
But I don't want to be a bomb!

12:44.176 --> 12:46.110
Hank! Hank!

12:46.145 --> 12:48.443
Just calm down.
Don't jump around so much.

12:48.481 --> 12:50.608
The movie guy said
that doesn't matter, Brock.

12:50.650 --> 12:52.777
He's not volatile
until he reaches stage four.

12:52.818 --> 12:54.285
And then what happens?

12:54.320 --> 12:56.049
Then I blow up, right?

12:56.088 --> 12:58.022
Well, not if we kill you first.

12:58.057 --> 13:01.117
That stops the metabolic
chain reaction lickety-split.

13:01.160 --> 13:02.889
What's this?
What's happening?

13:02.929 --> 13:05.762
Stage two... visible blemishes.

13:05.798 --> 13:07.527
Not a lot of time.

13:07.566 --> 13:09.056
Hank, listen to me.

13:09.101 --> 13:10.568
I'm gonna get you out of this.

13:10.603 --> 13:12.036
That's easy for you to say.

13:12.071 --> 13:13.436
You're not gonna blow up!

13:13.472 --> 13:15.531
Sure we would.
According to the movie...

13:15.574 --> 13:17.667
you can take out a whole city.

13:17.710 --> 13:21.908
Dude, what is with you?
Why are you so calm about this?

13:21.948 --> 13:24.917
Because, Hank, we're not
just any poor suckers...

13:24.951 --> 13:26.851
we're the Venture brothers.

13:26.886 --> 13:30.913
Our dad's a supergenius
with, like, chemistry stuff.

13:30.957 --> 13:32.584
He can fix this, no prob.

13:32.625 --> 13:34.752
Dean, we don't even know
where your dad is.

13:34.794 --> 13:39.754
He's sequestered in some
secret think tank, and this is, well...

13:39.799 --> 13:44.133
this is kind of out of his league, honestly.

13:44.170 --> 13:46.536
We're all gonna die!

13:46.572 --> 13:48.199
Not necessarily.

13:48.240 --> 13:52.609
There's one man on the planet
who might be able to help us.

13:52.645 --> 13:54.169
And I know where he is.

13:58.117 --> 14:00.142
That's good, Ned.
Thank you.

14:00.186 --> 14:03.747
Go back to your room now
before Richard sees you out.

14:09.762 --> 14:12.060
No more of that, OK?

14:12.098 --> 14:13.861
I'm sorry.
I should have told you.

14:13.899 --> 14:17.062
It takes all my concentration
to keep myself from turning invisible...

14:17.103 --> 14:19.298
and, well, what with all the drinking...

14:19.338 --> 14:21.067
You can turn invisible?

14:21.107 --> 14:22.438
Just my skin.

14:22.475 --> 14:24.272
There was an accident a few years ago.

14:24.310 --> 14:27.905
Richard was messing around
with one of his God-awful machines...

14:27.947 --> 14:31.576
trying to harness cosmic rays
with gamma radiation.

14:31.617 --> 14:33.084
My brother Cody was in town.

14:33.119 --> 14:35.917
I was giving him and my
mentally handicapped cousin Ned a tour...

14:35.955 --> 14:39.186
of the lmpossible Building in New York,
and there was this explosion.

14:39.225 --> 14:42.251
I remember when that happened!

14:42.294 --> 14:44.262
But go on. I'm sorry.
You were saying.

14:44.296 --> 14:48.096
It did this to me,
turned poor Ned into a walking callus.

14:48.134 --> 14:50.932
Cody can't touch oxygen
without bursting into flames...

14:50.970 --> 14:54.428
and Richard, as usual,
he was the lucky one.

14:54.473 --> 14:58.603
Yeah. Superstretchy
isn't so bad by comparison.

15:00.046 --> 15:02.844
He keeps us hidden away
from his government investors.

15:02.882 --> 15:05.214
Ned's used to that kind of treatment,
being a retard...

15:05.251 --> 15:07.242
and poor Cody's unconscious
most of the time...

15:07.286 --> 15:09.220
but it's been so hard for me.

15:10.923 --> 15:14.984
Peaches, are you bothering Dr. Venture?

15:15.027 --> 15:19.487
No, Richard.
I just came by for his sample.

15:19.532 --> 15:22.000
Splendid. I'll take that.

15:22.034 --> 15:25.629
Well, I guess you're
all done here then, hmm?

15:25.671 --> 15:27.502
Yes, Richard.

15:27.540 --> 15:29.235
Good night, Dr. Venture.

15:29.275 --> 15:31.539
Mrs. Impossible.

15:31.577 --> 15:36.310
Well, let's hope you do better on this test
than you did on your midterms, eh?

15:38.451 --> 15:42.251
What say you and I take a little ride, hmm?

15:42.288 --> 15:45.018
I've been good to you,
haven't I, Dr. Venture?

15:45.057 --> 15:46.081
What?

15:46.125 --> 15:49.424
I selected you for my think tank,
despite the military's protests...

15:49.462 --> 15:51.930
gave you a chance to do
some meaningful work...

15:51.964 --> 15:54.762
and make a little much-needed cash
at the same time.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.199
What? I can't...

15:56.235 --> 16:00.399
I don't mean to be cross with you,
but my point is, I had a few simple rules...

16:00.439 --> 16:01.872
and you broke them.

16:01.907 --> 16:04.307
Making a play for my wife is one thing...

16:04.343 --> 16:09.872
but going into restricted areas...
that I can't abide on a project like this.

16:11.917 --> 16:15.182
I'm glad we've had this little talk,
Dr. Venture.

16:15.221 --> 16:17.883
Believe you me, I understand how it is.

16:17.923 --> 16:23.054
Being cooped up in a windowless building
at the North Pole for an entire month...

16:23.095 --> 16:26.758
it can get to a man,
make him do crazy things.

16:26.799 --> 16:28.562
No, really. I'm fine.

16:28.601 --> 16:30.592
I mean, it's only been a couple of days.

16:30.636 --> 16:35.403
No, no. That's what I'm going to tell them
when they ask what happened to you...

16:35.441 --> 16:40.435
and I explain how you got cabin fever
and wandered off to die in the snow.

16:40.479 --> 16:41.844
Good-bye, Dr. Venture.

16:41.881 --> 16:45.908
What? Wait a minute. If this is
about what I saw, I won't tell anyone.

16:45.951 --> 16:47.646
I know.

16:47.686 --> 16:49.745
Oh, yeah?

16:49.788 --> 16:53.383
I cheated on my midterms!

17:00.065 --> 17:01.794
Oh, crap.

17:01.834 --> 17:04.200
I don't see why I have to be here.

17:04.236 --> 17:06.204
You guys can do this by yourselves.

17:06.238 --> 17:07.933
Oh, crap! Stage three!

17:07.973 --> 17:12.705
Brock, I've thought a lot about it,
and if we can't get the antidote in time...

17:12.744 --> 17:17.647
and it comes down to it,
l... well, I want you to be the one to kill me.

17:17.683 --> 17:19.207
Don't talk like that, Hank.
We're gonna fi...

17:19.251 --> 17:21.242
- Promise me, Brock!
- OK.

17:21.287 --> 17:22.948
- Promise?
- Yes, I promise.

17:22.988 --> 17:25.548
- Superswear?
- Yes, Hank.

17:25.590 --> 17:27.888
- Hey, Brock?
- Yeah.

17:27.926 --> 17:29.019
How would you do it?

17:29.061 --> 17:31.723
You're asleep.
Quick jerk of the neck, never feel a thing.

17:31.764 --> 17:32.924
You've thought about this.

17:32.965 --> 17:34.023
Yes, I have.

17:34.066 --> 17:35.260
Hey, is that...

17:35.301 --> 17:38.065
Keep moving.
Frostbite setting in.

17:38.103 --> 17:41.072
Gonna die, gonna die, gonna die.

17:41.106 --> 17:43.631
No. Must press on.

17:43.676 --> 17:45.701
Great, Venture!

17:45.744 --> 17:48.907
Thousands of square miles
of empty Arctic wasteland...

17:48.948 --> 17:52.349
and you somehow manage
to step in the one spot of yellow snow.

17:55.788 --> 17:57.483
I made you another sample.

17:57.523 --> 18:00.048
I, uh, huh?

18:00.092 --> 18:02.356
Come to me, Dr. Venture.

18:02.394 --> 18:05.192
Take me, you magnificent beast!

18:05.231 --> 18:08.632
I know how to keep you warm.

18:22.748 --> 18:26.081
Here. Put this on. You OK?

18:26.118 --> 18:28.211
I think my foreskin
might have just broken off.

18:28.254 --> 18:29.812
Wait a minute.
Are you a hallucination?

18:29.855 --> 18:31.015
Afraid not, Doc.

18:31.056 --> 18:32.182
What? Did you miss me?

18:32.224 --> 18:33.885
What the hell are you doing here?

18:33.926 --> 18:36.258
Hank's a bomb.
Long story.

18:36.295 --> 18:37.990
Richard, please.

18:38.030 --> 18:39.725
I can't live like this anymore.

18:39.765 --> 18:41.562
Sally, please be reasonable.

18:43.269 --> 18:46.761
Halt. This area is restricted on the authority
of the United States Government.

18:46.805 --> 18:48.329
I work for the government.

18:48.374 --> 18:50.069
Uh, still, you're not coming in here.

18:50.109 --> 18:52.077
Please, Professor, we need your help.

18:52.111 --> 18:55.342
Horsewash! I know you.
You're Venture's bodyguard.

18:55.381 --> 18:57.508
You just want to beat me up.

18:57.549 --> 18:59.642
Well, just you try it, mister.

18:59.685 --> 19:03.280
Try to beat up a man of living rubber!

19:05.224 --> 19:06.589
Can't hit what you can't catch.

19:08.127 --> 19:11.358
Stop wiggling around, you jackass!

19:11.397 --> 19:13.524
It's the Goliath Serum.

19:13.565 --> 19:15.032
The kid's full of it.

19:16.735 --> 19:18.703
Good lord. Hiccups?
He's at stage four.

19:18.737 --> 19:19.965
He could go at any minute.

19:20.005 --> 19:21.802
Is there an antidote, Professor?

19:21.840 --> 19:24.206
Well, yes. You kill him.

19:26.478 --> 19:27.706
Oh, what?

19:27.746 --> 19:29.179
Like that would stop me from shooting?

19:29.214 --> 19:30.909
What's going on out here?

19:30.949 --> 19:32.382
He's trying to kill my brother!

19:32.418 --> 19:34.318
The kid's all hopped up on serum.

19:34.353 --> 19:37.322
He's gonna explode
and take all of us with him if I don't.

19:37.356 --> 19:39.051
Well, isn't there an antidote?

19:39.091 --> 19:41.059
Listen. You got here late, OK?

19:41.093 --> 19:43.061
You're looking at the antidote!

19:43.095 --> 19:46.360
Professor, no offense, but that's just crazy.

19:46.398 --> 19:48.559
Violence isn't the answer.

19:48.600 --> 19:50.067
This is a think tank.

19:50.102 --> 19:52.468
We're the most powerful minds
on the planet.

19:52.504 --> 19:54.529
Let's act like it.

19:54.573 --> 19:58.065
Billy's right. We can create an antidote
if we work together.

19:59.411 --> 20:00.901
My way's safer.

20:00.946 --> 20:03.710
Bad Richard.
No hurt boy.

20:03.749 --> 20:05.444
Ned, what are you...
You son of a bitch!

20:05.484 --> 20:06.917
Cody?

20:06.952 --> 20:09.648
Let's stop this, boys.
Outrageous!

20:09.688 --> 20:12.350
Who do you think... hey!

20:12.391 --> 20:14.757
That's it, guys.
Tie him up good and tight.

20:16.295 --> 20:18.820
Well, are we ready, think tank?

20:50.062 --> 20:52.826
It worked!
We're freakin' geniuses!

20:52.865 --> 20:55.231
Yay, think tank!

20:55.267 --> 20:57.497
You freaking idiots!

20:57.536 --> 20:59.003
It didn't work.

20:59.037 --> 21:00.061
You people invented...

21:01.306 --> 21:03.001
Ranch dressing.

21:03.041 --> 21:04.235
How did you get free?

21:04.276 --> 21:07.712
There's a reason Ned's boots
have Velcro instead of laces, honey.

21:07.746 --> 21:10.840
Clearly the Goliath Serum
just doesn't work on humans.

21:10.883 --> 21:13.010
We certainly never tested it on any.

21:13.051 --> 21:15.349
I mean, that was the whole point.

21:15.387 --> 21:17.878
You send a bug or a dog
or something to blow up.

21:17.923 --> 21:20.255
You just can't stand
seeing Dr. Venture succeed...

21:20.292 --> 21:21.919
where you failed, can you, Richard?

21:21.960 --> 21:24.087
You've been on his case
since he got here!

21:24.129 --> 21:27.098
Well, guess what, Richard.
You lose again!

21:27.132 --> 21:28.929
I'm with Dr. Venture now!

21:28.967 --> 21:30.127
Excuse me?

21:30.169 --> 21:34.538
Cool! I'm not gonna explode anymore,
and plus, free invisible Mom!

21:34.573 --> 21:38.202
Go Team Venture!

21:38.243 --> 21:41.610
Hang on.
I'm gonna get my things.

21:41.647 --> 21:43.877
- You want to...
- Yeah. Go.

22:13.445 --> 22:15.242
You'll see, Sally.

22:15.280 --> 22:17.407
This is just a rough spot.

22:17.449 --> 22:22.079
In time, things will go back
to the way they... hmm?

22:22.120 --> 22:24.418
That's odd.

22:24.456 --> 22:27.254
Dr. Venture's... pregnant?

22:30.596 --> 22:33.588
That's good soup.
