00:00.108 --> 00:01.664
<i>Previously on</i> "Criminal Minds"...

00:01.712 --> 00:03.429
Mr. Scratch, Peter Lewis.

00:03.482 --> 00:05.914
Peter Lewis isn't just a
distraction, he's a terrorist.

00:05.930 --> 00:08.226
Scratch waged war against the BAU.

00:08.337 --> 00:11.726
We need to assume that Mr. Scratch
is targeting this entire team.

00:11.776 --> 00:14.914
His M.O. is to drug his victims
and make them hallucinate.

00:15.040 --> 00:16.093
En El piso.

00:16.155 --> 00:17.476
Reid was arrested in Mexico

00:17.539 --> 00:19.414
for illegal possession of drugs.

00:19.507 --> 00:21.570
He was severely drugged
at the time

00:21.647 --> 00:23.198
and doesn't remember anything.

00:23.246 --> 00:24.980
This has got to be Scratch.

00:25.028 --> 00:27.179
He's been punishing the team.
Now his target is Reid.

00:27.281 --> 00:28.460
Reid is in jail.

00:28.508 --> 00:31.342
And now he's
being charged with murder.

00:48.459 --> 00:49.459
Hi.

00:51.577 --> 00:52.492
Hey.

00:52.540 --> 00:53.940
Hey.

00:54.453 --> 00:56.570
I still can't wrap
my head around it.

00:56.726 --> 00:58.448
I know.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.945
I, uh, I took a change of clothes
to the precinct for him.

01:02.060 --> 01:03.393
Did you see him?

01:03.476 --> 01:04.843
Uh-uh. I left it
with Emily.

01:04.936 --> 01:07.359
She said he was finally
getting a little sleep.

01:07.803 --> 01:09.796
Now part of me's glad I
didn't see him locked up.

01:09.851 --> 01:10.765
I don't think I could take it.

01:10.813 --> 01:13.601
Ohh, our sweet, sweet
boy wonder.

01:14.775 --> 01:17.093
He's strong. He's gonna be ok.

01:17.264 --> 01:19.679
We got a new swab for him
and we're running it now.

01:19.775 --> 01:21.672
Well, what happened to the
comprehensive tox panel

01:21.719 --> 01:22.812
they ran in Mexico?

01:22.860 --> 01:25.132
With the red tape
between jurisdictions,

01:25.187 --> 01:28.179
Who knows if or when
we'll get those results.

01:28.247 --> 01:29.812
He should be here.
We need him.

01:29.860 --> 01:30.805
His mom needs him.

01:30.883 --> 01:31.816
His mother. How's his mother?

01:31.864 --> 01:33.609
Well, she cried at first.

01:33.683 --> 01:35.780
Said it was all her fault
he was even down there.

01:35.828 --> 01:39.570
But later she kept asking
when Spencer would be home.

01:39.618 --> 01:41.765
Well, maybe it's a blessing
she can forget.

01:41.835 --> 01:43.534
What's our next step?

01:43.638 --> 01:46.554
Well, getting the kid
home on bail pending trial.

01:46.632 --> 01:48.406
Ok. That's a good
baby step.

01:48.457 --> 01:49.406
I can focus on that.

01:49.454 --> 01:51.984
And I'm ready, willing,
and able to post that bail

01:52.109 --> 01:53.804
No matter how high they set it.

01:53.864 --> 01:56.054
I love you so hard.

01:56.208 --> 01:57.208
Hmm.

01:58.187 --> 02:00.277
Well, crime never sleeps.

02:00.523 --> 02:03.079
We got a case.

02:05.171 --> 02:06.523
Prentiss won't be joining us.

02:06.579 --> 02:09.703
She's on Reid duty
for the time being.

02:09.782 --> 02:12.625
This one was referred to us
by a fellow federal agency,

02:12.673 --> 02:14.945
The national transportation
safety board.

02:15.039 --> 02:17.494
So, last week,
two separate incidents.

02:17.542 --> 02:19.695
Two separate vehicles hit
two separate pedestrians,

02:19.743 --> 02:21.196
crashed on the same
stretch of road

02:21.244 --> 02:23.523
In Bradenton, Florida,
just outside of Sarasota.

02:23.571 --> 02:25.453
And they're sure
they're both accidents?

02:25.501 --> 02:27.234
No, they don't think so.

02:27.373 --> 02:29.867
Both vehicles
were 2013 Meridians,

02:29.915 --> 02:32.500
and both drivers said
they lost control of the cars.

02:32.548 --> 02:33.921
The first pedestrian is alive,

02:33.969 --> 02:36.164
But the second one
died of his injuries.

02:36.239 --> 02:38.398
And it wasn't a vehicle defect?

02:38.524 --> 02:40.695
That's what the ntsb suspected,

02:40.762 --> 02:42.578
but they've done extensive tests

02:42.626 --> 02:43.601
And they've ruled that out,

02:43.649 --> 02:45.765
along with hazardous
road conditions.

02:45.822 --> 02:47.742
And they're saying
driver error is unlikely,

02:47.805 --> 02:50.241
though the drivers suffered
head injuries in the crashes

02:50.304 --> 02:52.109
and they can't recall
any of the details.

02:52.157 --> 02:55.328
Same make and model vehicle, two
drivers saying they lost control.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.171
It sounds like
they're thinking hacker.

02:57.244 --> 02:59.979
Could be. Most cars
made after 2009,

03:00.027 --> 03:01.426
regardless of make or model,

03:01.474 --> 03:02.859
are vulnerable to hacking.

03:02.907 --> 03:04.460
Is there any footage
of the crashes?

03:04.523 --> 03:08.078
Oh, yeah. Middle school security
camera caught the moments of impact.

03:08.127 --> 03:11.187
Brace yourselves. It ain't pretty.
Here we go.

03:18.195 --> 03:20.504
No swerving, no braking,

03:20.656 --> 03:23.648
and an unsub turning cars
into murder weapons.

03:23.709 --> 03:24.962
That's terrifying.

03:25.010 --> 03:27.277
It could be a whole new
frontier for serial killers.

03:27.343 --> 03:30.420
Well, Garcia, since your area of
expertise is relevant on this one,

03:30.468 --> 03:31.948
I want you to join us in the field.

03:32.156 --> 03:33.757
Me? Going wheels up?

03:33.919 --> 03:35.531
Sir, yes, sir.

03:35.820 --> 03:38.740
Great. Wheels up in 20.

04:02.497 --> 04:04.052
Hey.

04:04.513 --> 04:05.872
You should be in the office.

04:06.013 --> 04:08.685
I'm right where
I need to be. You ok?

04:08.904 --> 04:10.591
Yeah. I'm ok.

04:11.161 --> 04:13.130
How's my mom doing?

04:13.237 --> 04:15.537
She's doing well.
JJ's been by to visit

04:15.594 --> 04:17.036
every day since your arrest.

04:17.084 --> 04:19.377
She explained everything
to your mom.

04:19.464 --> 04:22.740
Cassie's been great.
That makes a big difference.

04:23.075 --> 04:24.367
I'm such an idiot.

04:24.419 --> 04:26.570
Don't, Spencer, don't.

04:26.618 --> 04:28.372
You were trying
to help your mother.

04:28.450 --> 04:30.896
I fell right into Scratch's trap.

04:31.052 --> 04:32.279
He won't win.

04:32.333 --> 04:33.210
He already has.

04:33.258 --> 04:34.880
Just the battle, not the war.

04:34.913 --> 04:36.396
You didn't do anything wrong.

04:36.444 --> 04:38.200
You and I both know
that doesn't matter.

04:38.286 --> 04:41.279
all that matters is what
the prosecutor can prove,

04:41.327 --> 04:44.137
and Scratch has stacked
the deck against me.

04:44.505 --> 04:46.365
Even the FBI's abandoned me.

04:46.482 --> 04:49.622
I know.
But we'll keep fighting.

04:50.646 --> 04:52.771
I don't even have a lawyer.

04:52.904 --> 04:54.485
About that...

04:54.810 --> 04:56.900
I have a friend, Fiona Duncan.

04:56.982 --> 04:58.310
I've known her forever.

04:58.404 --> 04:59.857
Her father was in
the foreign service,

04:59.904 --> 05:02.746
and we met in Italy when my
mother was charge d'affaires

05:02.794 --> 05:03.894
at the embassy there.

05:03.942 --> 05:06.052
After college
she was a Rhodes Scholar.

05:06.122 --> 05:08.207
You'd like her.
Anyway, now she's

05:08.255 --> 05:10.740
one of the best Defense
Attorneys in D.C.

05:11.318 --> 05:13.817
I would like it if you would
let me reach out to her

05:13.865 --> 05:15.638
about representing you.

05:15.810 --> 05:17.404
Emily, I really,
I appreciate it,

05:17.490 --> 05:20.443
but you helping me could
destroy your reputation

05:20.503 --> 05:21.635
At the bureau.

05:21.857 --> 05:23.466
My battle, my choice.

05:23.575 --> 05:25.286
Please, let me help you.

05:25.365 --> 05:27.497
Tell me I can reach out
to my friend.

05:30.318 --> 05:32.002
Thank you.

05:32.622 --> 05:34.294
Good.

05:34.406 --> 05:35.705
Spencer, listen to me.

05:35.771 --> 05:37.193
We are gonna
get you out of here,

05:37.337 --> 05:39.203
I promise.

Synchronized by <font color=#00FF00>srjanapala</font>

06:14.888 --> 06:16.418
The illusion of control

06:16.466 --> 06:18.848
Makes the helplessness
seem more palatable.

06:18.946 --> 06:20.612
Allie brosh.

06:20.957 --> 06:22.574
Not to be critical or anything,

06:22.645 --> 06:25.699
But this place could really
use a splash of color.

06:25.817 --> 06:29.293
Really? I find the
neutral tones soothing.

06:29.387 --> 06:32.129
Yeah, and they're a great background
for when you're on the big screen.

06:32.176 --> 06:35.684
You mean I'm the splash
of color? Stop it.

06:36.313 --> 06:39.147
I've got Emily calling in.

06:39.278 --> 06:40.378
How's the kid doing?

06:40.380 --> 06:41.445
He's hanging in.

06:41.447 --> 06:42.747
I'm meeting with
an attorney today.

06:42.749 --> 06:44.115
I'm hoping she'll take his case.

06:44.117 --> 06:45.149
That's great.

06:45.151 --> 06:47.118
It feels weird
to not be on a jet.

06:47.283 --> 06:49.040
Well, we've got
everything here covered.

06:49.088 --> 06:50.838
Garcia's keeping your seat warm.

06:50.924 --> 06:54.447
You just stay focused on Reid and
get us an update when you can.

06:54.650 --> 06:56.252
Will do.

06:56.562 --> 06:58.642
All right, let's get
down to business.

06:58.759 --> 07:00.103
Garcia, what have you
got for us?

07:00.197 --> 07:02.103
Just this.

07:02.338 --> 07:04.424
Two drivers and two pedestrians.

07:04.595 --> 07:07.924
Well, the victimology on this
case is going to be difficult.

07:07.972 --> 07:09.299
It's just hard to know

07:09.347 --> 07:11.369
Who the unsub's
intended victims are.

07:11.417 --> 07:13.636
And the drivers,
the D.A.'s considering

07:13.684 --> 07:14.853
Murder charges in both cases,

07:14.914 --> 07:16.881
not to mention
the psychological damage

07:16.883 --> 07:17.982
this unsub's inflicted

07:17.984 --> 07:20.651
Or the pedestrians, or both.

07:20.699 --> 07:23.506
Any connection between the
drivers and the people they hit?

07:23.589 --> 07:24.717
Just what we already know.

07:24.765 --> 07:26.442
Both drivers have
the same kind of vehicle

07:26.490 --> 07:27.792
and it happened
at the same location.

07:27.794 --> 07:28.943
Besides that, nothing.

07:29.014 --> 07:30.134
So what does the unsub want?

07:30.217 --> 07:32.061
Well, he's causing
death and destruction

07:32.115 --> 07:33.936
while exerting
power and control.

07:34.061 --> 07:36.287
And creating a public spectacle.

07:36.389 --> 07:37.702
Maybe there's some
paraphilia there,

07:37.749 --> 07:40.044
like an arsonist
who likes to watch.

07:40.138 --> 07:43.019
If this is about voyeurism,
that might make it sexual,

07:43.067 --> 07:45.154
and if so, he's
not likely to stop.

07:45.326 --> 07:47.115
This just in.
One of the drivers,

07:47.163 --> 07:48.811
Marta Calderon, she's
agreed to an interview.

07:48.858 --> 07:50.543
All right. JJ, Luke,
Garcia,

07:50.591 --> 07:51.833
You head to the crash site.

07:51.872 --> 07:54.317
A special investigator
from the NTSB

07:54.365 --> 07:55.654
Will meet you there.

07:55.787 --> 07:56.966
Tara, Stephen, and I

07:57.014 --> 07:59.991
will go straight
to the Bradenton P.D.

08:02.420 --> 08:04.607
There's not a lot
of good news in this file.

08:04.731 --> 08:08.466
Yeah. Well, that's why
he needs you.

08:08.771 --> 08:10.601
I'm so glad you're here.

08:10.967 --> 08:13.381
I was surprised
you settled down in Washington.

08:13.498 --> 08:15.381
Yeah, I guess I got
tired of wandering.

08:15.490 --> 08:16.692
And D.C.'s
always been home.

08:16.740 --> 08:18.137
and after law school, you know,

08:18.185 --> 08:19.942
I realized all I wanted
was to come home.

08:19.990 --> 08:21.350
I'm glad you did.

08:22.006 --> 08:23.857
Spencer is being framed.

08:23.950 --> 08:26.107
It's a long story,
and I will fill you in,

08:26.201 --> 08:28.782
but I need you to know
he didn't kill anyone.

08:28.946 --> 08:31.088
Nonetheless, the circumstantial
evidence is compelling,

08:31.135 --> 08:32.212
and for better or for worse,

08:32.260 --> 08:34.063
this trial's going to be
about what can be proven,

08:34.110 --> 08:35.828
not what actually happened.

08:35.914 --> 08:37.794
Spencer said the same
thing this morning.

08:37.970 --> 08:39.048
He's a realist.

08:39.131 --> 08:41.664
That's a good quality
to have in a client.

08:41.837 --> 08:43.462
Does that mean
you'll take the case?

08:43.578 --> 08:45.102
It means I'll be happy
to sit down with him.

08:45.149 --> 08:47.282
Let's see how it goes and
we'll take it from there.

08:47.399 --> 08:49.423
He is innocent, Fiona.

08:49.475 --> 08:51.649
That has to count for something.

08:51.845 --> 08:53.274
The fact that you have
so much faith in him

08:53.321 --> 08:55.321
counts for a lot with me.

08:57.900 --> 08:59.517
Thank you.

09:05.306 --> 09:08.407
We had the NSTB coordinate
with the Bradenton P.D.

09:08.493 --> 09:10.394
And we shut down this
whole stretch of road.

09:10.563 --> 09:13.806
Good call.
Don't see any skid marks.

09:13.915 --> 09:16.266
There weren't any. Not
for either accident.

09:16.415 --> 09:18.274
Well, if the unsub
likes to watch,

09:18.384 --> 09:20.871
the question is, where
is he watching from?

09:21.048 --> 09:22.773
Yeah, 'cause this is too open

09:22.868 --> 09:25.810
for our guy to be able to
comfortably watch from outside.

09:26.040 --> 09:28.946
We could canvass all the shops
and homes along this route.

09:29.055 --> 09:32.477
We can, but anyone
with his organization

09:32.563 --> 09:35.368
and hacking ability wouldn't
be careless enough for that.

09:35.579 --> 09:39.062
Everything about this unsub
is one degree of separation

09:39.110 --> 09:40.243
from the destruction.

09:41.126 --> 09:42.233
Right there.

09:42.306 --> 09:43.423
Traffic camera.

09:43.524 --> 09:44.915
Those cameras are closed circuit.

09:45.001 --> 09:46.556
Florida D.O.T. has hundreds of them.

09:46.618 --> 09:49.274
They only provide real-time
visuals of current traffic.

09:49.360 --> 09:50.773
Exactly. They're everywhere.

09:50.821 --> 09:51.922
And they can be hacked.

09:51.970 --> 09:53.330
So he can hack into any one of them

09:53.377 --> 09:54.375
and watch in real time.

09:54.423 --> 09:55.703
Yes, he can, newbie.

09:55.751 --> 09:57.718
So he can control a hacked car

09:57.766 --> 09:59.696
like a remote control toy.

09:59.845 --> 10:01.791
I thought you all might want
to look at the vehicles.

10:01.838 --> 10:04.298
We've got them in impound.

10:05.548 --> 10:07.243
The boy I hit,

10:07.821 --> 10:09.681
he was only 23.

10:10.454 --> 10:12.556
I have a 19-year-old daughter.

10:13.079 --> 10:16.493
I can't imagine what his
family's going through.

10:17.118 --> 10:19.931
Marta, I want to try
to help you remember

10:20.110 --> 10:23.376
By doing something called
a cognitive interview.

10:23.509 --> 10:27.470
It could help dislodge memories that
are stuck right below the surface.

10:27.540 --> 10:29.454
I need answers.

10:29.540 --> 10:31.243
What do I have to do?

10:32.000 --> 10:33.089
Ok.

10:33.141 --> 10:36.016
Just relax, close your eyes.

10:36.399 --> 10:38.751
I want you to walk me
through that day,

10:38.915 --> 10:41.438
exactly as you experienced it.

10:41.618 --> 10:44.134
So you leave work
to go get in your car.

10:44.188 --> 10:46.220
It's parked in the lot outside.

10:46.470 --> 10:49.047
Is it where you remember leaving it?

10:49.226 --> 10:50.594
Yes.

10:50.710 --> 10:52.834
Do you notice anything unusual

10:52.882 --> 10:54.798
as you start to drive home?

10:55.476 --> 10:56.648
No.

10:56.749 --> 10:59.828
I turn on the radio
to listen to the news.

11:00.320 --> 11:01.890
I'm almost home.

11:03.107 --> 11:05.441
But then...

11:10.328 --> 11:12.082
I don't think this is gonna work.

11:12.273 --> 11:15.062
Marta, what happened
to you, it was traumatic.

11:15.226 --> 11:19.690
And remembering it, going
back to that experience,

11:19.890 --> 11:21.288
it's gonna be painful.

11:21.406 --> 11:24.531
But this process here with me,

11:24.671 --> 11:28.687
This is safe. Do you
think you can continue?

11:31.137 --> 11:32.851
Ok.

11:34.453 --> 11:36.537
You're in your car,
you're driving home,

11:36.585 --> 11:38.257
everything seems normal.

11:38.460 --> 11:40.421
You're almost home, and then...

11:40.523 --> 11:42.359
Something happens.

11:42.610 --> 11:44.376
What happens?

11:46.257 --> 11:48.476
There's something
wrong with the radio.

11:48.621 --> 11:51.374
It's changing stations.

11:51.773 --> 11:54.701
I'm trying to get it back
to my regular station,

11:54.749 --> 11:57.428
98.2...
but it stays on 98.2.

11:57.734 --> 11:59.523
I can't change it.

11:59.665 --> 12:03.507
Then... The windows.

12:03.636 --> 12:05.116
What's happening?

12:05.238 --> 12:08.015
They're rolling
up and down by themselves.

12:08.265 --> 12:11.046
And the windshield
wipers are going.

12:12.679 --> 12:15.609
I... I need to pull over.

12:15.873 --> 12:16.860
Why don't you?

12:16.913 --> 12:18.116
I can't.

12:18.171 --> 12:19.416
I'm hitting the brakes,

12:19.472 --> 12:22.140
but the car is speeding up.

12:22.921 --> 12:24.421
What do you do now?

12:24.844 --> 12:27.702
I'm running a stop sign.

12:28.210 --> 12:30.827
And then the car turns left

12:30.882 --> 12:34.952
Onto Whitlock place.

12:35.632 --> 12:37.001
I don't know where I'm going.

12:37.097 --> 12:39.304
This isn't the way to my house.

12:44.346 --> 12:47.098
I was hoping for driver error.

12:47.221 --> 12:49.792
This is a whole lot scarier.

12:49.940 --> 12:52.082
What happens next?

12:52.690 --> 12:53.987
I see him.

12:54.053 --> 12:55.596
Todd?

12:55.870 --> 12:57.346
The young man you hit?

12:58.081 --> 12:59.940
He was just a kid.

13:00.909 --> 13:03.861
I'm screaming for him
to get out of the way,

13:04.206 --> 13:06.495
but he doesn't even
see me coming.

13:06.659 --> 13:08.362
I close my eyes,

13:08.471 --> 13:13.470
but I hear him hit the car.
[horn honking, impact, Todd screaming]

13:16.057 --> 13:18.057
That sound, ohh...

13:18.659 --> 13:21.393
I'll hear it for
the rest of my life.

13:21.924 --> 13:24.143
I'm so, so, sorry.

13:24.291 --> 13:25.478
Listen to me.

13:25.596 --> 13:28.737
You did not cause that accident.

13:29.085 --> 13:30.870
You did nothing wrong.

13:38.791 --> 13:40.151
Hey, how's it going down there?

13:40.199 --> 13:43.100
Well, it looks like we've got a
malicious hacker on our hands.

13:43.148 --> 13:46.570
And he's got a wireless
foothold to a 2013 meridian.

13:46.698 --> 13:48.259
Meridians are a popular model.

13:48.307 --> 13:49.588
He's got a huge victim pool.

13:49.659 --> 13:51.721
Well, we're working
on narrowing it down.

13:51.924 --> 13:53.518
Did you get Reid that lawyer?

13:53.612 --> 13:56.347
I'm on my way to the jail right
now to make the introduction.

13:56.395 --> 13:57.479
Great.

13:57.527 --> 13:59.226
I'll let you know how it goes.

14:10.588 --> 14:12.213
Hi.
Spencer, hello.

14:12.264 --> 14:14.652
Fiona Duncan. Emily speaks
very highly of you.

14:15.002 --> 14:16.604
You, too.
It's nice to meet you.

14:16.713 --> 14:19.299
I'm sorry we're meeting
under these circumstances.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.275
Emily, this is
an attorney-client meeting.

14:21.323 --> 14:22.197
We'll need privacy.

14:22.245 --> 14:24.073
- Yes, of course.
- Are you ok?

14:24.190 --> 14:25.809
- All right. Bye.
- Yeah.

14:31.083 --> 14:32.416
I know you're aware of this,

14:32.464 --> 14:34.330
but I need to remind you
that everything we discuss

14:34.377 --> 14:36.018
is covered by
Attorney-Client Privilege.

14:36.088 --> 14:37.121
It's confidential.

14:37.123 --> 14:39.322
Not even Emily will know
what we've discussed.

14:39.370 --> 14:41.392
- Ok.
- I understand. Thank you.

14:41.495 --> 14:43.776
So tell me about what
happened down in Mexico.

14:43.877 --> 14:45.643
I did not kill her.

14:46.620 --> 14:49.666
Ok. I'm just asking
what happened.

14:50.815 --> 14:53.291
Sadly, I don't know.

14:54.666 --> 14:56.039
That's a problem.

14:56.377 --> 14:57.791
Because I don't need you
to be innocent,

14:57.838 --> 15:00.362
but I do need you to be able
to assist in your own defense.

15:01.088 --> 15:03.580
- There's a lot I don't remember.
- Ok.

15:03.807 --> 15:06.213
I want to be
very clear about this.

15:06.659 --> 15:08.588
I'm not here to judge you.

15:08.815 --> 15:10.455
I'm here to defend you.

15:10.588 --> 15:13.440
My goal is a simple one...
To keep you out of jail.

15:13.604 --> 15:15.959
But in order to do that,
I need a narrative.

15:16.073 --> 15:17.713
Your story.

15:18.268 --> 15:20.051
If you killed her,
I can work with that.

15:20.135 --> 15:23.521
But what I can't work with
is a client who lies to me.

15:23.768 --> 15:26.403
Because those lies will always
come back to bite us on the ass.

15:26.534 --> 15:28.987
And by us, I mean you.

15:29.416 --> 15:31.978
Lying to me could mean the
difference between going home

15:32.026 --> 15:34.291
Or spending the rest
of your life in a cage.

15:34.401 --> 15:35.416
Do you understand me?

15:35.495 --> 15:36.495
Yes.

15:36.549 --> 15:39.237
Good. Because I need
to know everything.

15:39.471 --> 15:40.854
I don't care how bad
it makes you look.

15:40.901 --> 15:42.112
I need to know.

15:42.330 --> 15:43.924
Ok.

15:45.151 --> 15:46.991
Let's start with what
you're not telling Emily.

15:48.409 --> 15:49.961
You remember more
than you're admitting.

15:50.008 --> 15:51.094
I don't. Honestly, I...

15:51.142 --> 15:52.950
I told the Mexican
police everything.

15:52.998 --> 15:54.324
Well, that was very
cooperative of you.

15:54.371 --> 15:56.252
Too cooperative for someone
who has intimate knowledge

15:56.299 --> 15:57.290
of the criminal justice system,

15:57.338 --> 15:58.376
Even someone on drugs.

15:58.424 --> 16:00.955
I wasn't on drugs.
I was drugged.

16:01.135 --> 16:02.096
You stole a car?

16:02.144 --> 16:03.306
That's what they told me.

16:03.354 --> 16:04.189
Did you know there were
drugs in the trunk?

16:04.237 --> 16:05.135
I don't think so.

16:05.183 --> 16:06.566
Was Rosa already dead
when you took the car?

16:06.613 --> 16:08.690
I'm not sure. She was stabbed.
She was bleeding.

16:08.738 --> 16:09.487
Who stabbed her?

16:09.541 --> 16:11.213
- I don't know.
- Did you see who did it?

16:11.261 --> 16:13.080
There was someone else
in the room, but...

16:13.128 --> 16:13.869
Man or woman?

16:13.917 --> 16:15.502
I don't know
because I was drugged.

16:15.550 --> 16:18.451
- How'd you get blood on your hands?
- It was all hazy.

16:18.971 --> 16:19.970
I don't know.

16:20.018 --> 16:21.385
Yes, you do.

16:21.518 --> 16:23.827
You cut it. How'd you cut it?

16:26.916 --> 16:28.651
I... I cut it
on a knife.

16:28.791 --> 16:30.244
The murder weapon?

16:30.868 --> 16:31.954
I think so.

16:32.002 --> 16:33.221
How many times did you stab her?

16:33.268 --> 16:34.157
- I didn't.
- Who did?

16:34.205 --> 16:35.446
I don't know.
The other person

16:35.494 --> 16:36.955
in the room stabbed her.

16:37.010 --> 16:39.299
I did not kill her.
I think I was trying

16:39.347 --> 16:40.970
to stop whoever did.
And I'm trying,

16:41.018 --> 16:42.502
believe me,
I'm trying to remember.

16:42.565 --> 16:44.814
But I don't. And I
keep pressing this cut

16:44.862 --> 16:45.971
trying to trigger something,

16:46.018 --> 16:47.689
but I don't remember anything,

16:47.737 --> 16:51.522
and I swear to God I'm
telling you the truth.

16:53.524 --> 16:55.257
I believe you.

16:56.893 --> 16:59.002
If you remember anything,

16:59.213 --> 17:03.127
even if it seems
inconsequential, call me.

17:03.643 --> 17:05.002
Thank you.

17:05.317 --> 17:06.326
Thank you for believing me.

17:06.373 --> 17:07.940
Don't thank me.

17:08.635 --> 17:10.560
This isn't going to be easy.

17:11.079 --> 17:12.209
What happens now?

17:12.368 --> 17:14.393
Well, you consented to a
postponement of your arraignment

17:14.440 --> 17:16.118
So you'd have time
to find representation,

17:16.243 --> 17:18.446
now that you have me,
that's what'll happen first.

17:18.526 --> 17:20.329
I'll get it calendared
as soon as possible.

17:20.510 --> 17:21.571
And I'll plead not guilty.

17:21.645 --> 17:24.246
And I'll move to have you
released on bail pending trial.

17:27.118 --> 17:29.854
After that, we start
an uphill battle.

17:30.104 --> 17:33.080
The bad news is they have a lot of
circumstantial evidence against you.

17:33.244 --> 17:34.364
Is there any good news?

17:34.533 --> 17:37.408
The good news is they don't
have a murder weapon.

17:42.268 --> 17:47.344
[rock music playing on radio]

18:02.502 --> 18:05.228
What is going on?

18:15.080 --> 18:16.707
What...

18:23.393 --> 18:25.582
What is happening?

18:29.549 --> 18:31.188
Damn!

18:36.668 --> 18:38.401
Get out of the way!

18:39.598 --> 18:41.674
Get...

18:45.537 --> 18:47.842
Aah!

18:48.140 --> 18:49.973
No... get out of the street.

18:49.975 --> 18:53.725
You are listening
to wuko, 98.2.

18:57.516 --> 18:58.786
Move!

18:58.953 --> 19:01.287
Aah!

19:07.285 --> 19:09.614
It's a different
make and model car.

19:09.762 --> 19:12.692
It's newer. A 2016 Schuyler.

19:12.887 --> 19:15.129
Our unsub saw the new
wireless foothold,

19:15.270 --> 19:19.067
And he's no longer confiding
himself to one street.

19:19.707 --> 19:22.731
I'm not seeing
any traffic cameras here.

19:22.832 --> 19:25.192
So how's he watching?

19:28.309 --> 19:30.379
Jennifer, look.

19:32.645 --> 19:35.574
Dashboard camera
and a mounted smartphone.

19:35.707 --> 19:38.355
If he's hacking both, he
could use the dashboard cam

19:38.403 --> 19:40.879
to guide the car to its target

19:41.043 --> 19:44.486
and simultaneously watch
the terrified driver.

19:44.598 --> 19:45.688
An escalation.

19:45.690 --> 19:47.589
He needs more to get his thrill.

19:47.692 --> 19:49.091
We got an eyewitness.

19:49.139 --> 19:51.881
He says the car swerved to
avoid hitting a pedestrian

19:51.929 --> 19:53.195
before he hit the woman.

19:53.243 --> 19:55.535
He's narrowing
his selection criteria.

19:55.599 --> 19:57.191
So he specifically targeted

19:57.239 --> 19:59.559
an attractive,
dark-haired woman.

19:59.754 --> 20:01.996
Penelope Garcia

20:02.051 --> 20:04.440
on location for
a limited time only.

20:04.606 --> 20:06.723
Yeah, the most recent
pedestrian victim...

20:06.771 --> 20:07.675
What you got on her?

20:07.723 --> 20:09.042
Ohh, that's right, victim.

20:09.090 --> 20:10.964
I make jokes
to cover up the sad.

20:11.012 --> 20:12.901
Ok, Meredith courtelis,

20:12.949 --> 20:16.128
22, raven-haired beauty.
She was low risk.

20:16.176 --> 20:18.317
She lived with her parents.
She was going to school.

20:18.395 --> 20:20.151
She wanted to be
a physician's assistant.

20:20.199 --> 20:21.574
What about a boyfriend?

20:21.660 --> 20:23.918
She doesn't have one. Not
according to her social media.

20:24.035 --> 20:25.426
Looks like Meredith
was her own girl.

20:25.473 --> 20:27.544
Chronically single. Friends
kept trying to set her up.

20:27.591 --> 20:29.871
All right, well, this unsub
specifically targeted her

20:29.949 --> 20:31.778
over other available targets.

20:31.926 --> 20:34.793
Is there a connection to the driver?
His name's Mark Keeling.

20:35.231 --> 20:36.903
Mm, I got bupkis on that.

20:37.051 --> 20:38.465
No connection.

20:38.660 --> 20:42.511
The one thing
he's been consistent about.

20:45.816 --> 20:47.386
That was the AUSA.

20:47.434 --> 20:48.317
Good news?

20:48.319 --> 20:50.145
They're offering us a deal.

20:50.723 --> 20:52.087
They want me to plead guilty?

20:52.135 --> 20:53.668
To involuntary manslaughter.

20:53.762 --> 20:55.543
And the offer's 2 to 5 years.

20:55.626 --> 20:57.035
I'll leave you two
to discuss this.

20:57.083 --> 20:58.933
- Wait, don't go.
- I want her to stay.

20:58.981 --> 21:01.106
She can hear anything
you have to say to me.

21:01.387 --> 21:02.645
2 to 5 years.

21:02.856 --> 21:04.262
That's a lot of time.

21:04.422 --> 21:07.215
I understand. But it's
all about perspective.

21:07.356 --> 21:08.442
It's a lot more than nothing,

21:08.489 --> 21:10.153
but a lot less than 25 to life,

21:10.223 --> 21:12.035
Which is what you'd be
facing if convicted.

21:12.129 --> 21:14.418
You think I should take it?

21:14.559 --> 21:16.559
I think, given what's at stake,

21:16.637 --> 21:19.676
You owe it to yourself
to carefully consider it.

21:20.293 --> 21:23.551
I don't think I can lie
and say that I did this.

21:23.687 --> 21:24.848
Is that foolish?

21:24.910 --> 21:26.522
No. No, of course not.

21:26.570 --> 21:28.290
I don't want to see you
plead guilty

21:28.338 --> 21:29.723
to a crime you didn't commit.

21:29.858 --> 21:31.858
Or maybe I should cut my losses.

21:32.863 --> 21:34.987
Well, the offer is so low,

21:35.035 --> 21:36.160
Is that a good sign?

21:36.215 --> 21:37.379
Does it mean that the government

21:37.426 --> 21:38.590
thinks they've got a weak case?

21:38.637 --> 21:40.582
- Possibly.
- So that's good.

21:40.645 --> 21:42.270
Well, not necessarily it could also mean

21:42.318 --> 21:44.481
they're trying to clear the case
quickly with minimal publicity

21:44.528 --> 21:47.496
I honestly don't know
what it means.

21:47.715 --> 21:48.809
And I'm not in the business

21:48.857 --> 21:50.629
of second-guessing
good offers.

21:50.793 --> 21:52.192
Which this is.

21:52.356 --> 21:54.683
But I'm also not the one
who will be doing time.

21:55.067 --> 21:57.793
What would you do in my shoes?

21:58.824 --> 22:00.622
I'm not in your shoes.

22:00.701 --> 22:02.735
It's a decision
only you can make.

22:04.715 --> 22:07.793
Whatever you decide,
I'm always in your corner.

22:07.841 --> 22:09.388
We all are.

22:13.785 --> 22:16.058
Spencer, if you want
to fight this to the end,

22:16.106 --> 22:17.831
I promise you
I will bring everything

22:17.879 --> 22:19.489
in my arsenal to the battle.

22:19.653 --> 22:20.997
But what I can't promise you

22:21.045 --> 22:24.446
is a better outcome than the one
they're offering you today.

22:26.892 --> 22:28.723
I want to fight.

22:32.637 --> 22:36.879
This unsub is what's known
as a sadistic symphorophiliac.

22:37.192 --> 22:39.590
Symphorophilia
is a type of paraphilia

22:39.645 --> 22:41.848
in which sexual arousal
is derived from staging

22:41.910 --> 22:43.395
and then watching disasters,

22:43.457 --> 22:46.590
Such as fires, or in this
case, car accidents.

22:47.410 --> 22:50.020
Observing
the destruction he causes

22:50.090 --> 22:52.274
is extremely important
to this unsub.

22:52.395 --> 22:53.981
He enjoys watching the terror

22:54.029 --> 22:55.722
Of the drivers
whose cars he hijacks,

22:55.770 --> 22:58.535
as well as the impact with his
chosen pedestrian victim.

22:58.660 --> 23:01.004
In order to watch,
he hacks traffic cameras

23:01.114 --> 23:03.105
or in-car dashboard
cameras,

23:03.153 --> 23:05.287
As well as dash-mounted
smartphones.

23:05.356 --> 23:07.160
No! Get out of the street!

23:07.239 --> 23:08.848
Oh, please. Please!

23:09.126 --> 23:10.879
Now, so far there's
no apparent connection

23:10.928 --> 23:14.417
between the drivers of the vehicles
and their pedestrian victims.

23:14.528 --> 23:17.856
Instead, it appears
the drivers are selected

23:17.910 --> 23:19.364
based on the vehicles
they drive.

23:19.470 --> 23:20.869
This pattern of vehicle
selection

23:20.918 --> 23:23.059
was initially limited
to a single make and model,

23:23.176 --> 23:26.098
but he has since expanded
his hacking capabilities.

23:26.262 --> 23:30.245
We believe our unsub is a white
male in his mid-to late 20s.

23:30.293 --> 23:32.621
This unsub is careful enough
to select drivers

23:32.676 --> 23:35.239
based on after market
add-ons to their vehicles,

23:35.324 --> 23:38.987
such as dashboard cams
or smartphone mounts.

23:43.246 --> 23:45.594
Workplace parking lots would
be really good hunting grounds.

23:45.660 --> 23:48.067
Because he'd be able to see
the same cars over and over,

23:48.176 --> 23:50.434
And once he's determined
that that driver

23:50.528 --> 23:53.504
is using those after market
devices consistently, bang,

23:53.566 --> 23:54.736
That's his next victim.

23:54.824 --> 23:57.918
His first two hijackings were in
order to perfect his technique.

23:58.004 --> 24:00.504
and those pedestrians
were victims of opportunity.

24:00.598 --> 24:02.692
However, this latest
hijacking reveals

24:02.785 --> 24:04.309
That he's refining
his victim criteria.

24:04.410 --> 24:07.551
He specifically chose a young,
attractive, dark-haired woman.

24:07.662 --> 24:09.387
It's like this
victim was a surrogate

24:09.503 --> 24:12.606
for someone the unsub seeks
to terrify and punish.

24:12.731 --> 24:15.597
This unsub my lack the
confidence and social skills

24:15.645 --> 24:17.692
necessary to form
healthy relationships,

24:17.785 --> 24:19.628
which could be fueling his anger.

24:19.895 --> 24:22.239
We anticipate his next
victim or victims

24:22.287 --> 24:24.073
to be young, attractive women

24:24.121 --> 24:26.317
with whom he has some sort
of personal connection.

24:26.371 --> 24:27.957
Encourage drivers
to protect themselves

24:28.020 --> 24:29.910
by removing after market
dashboard cameras

24:30.020 --> 24:32.073
and to refrain from
mounting smartphones

24:32.121 --> 24:33.809
on their dashboards or CD slots.

24:33.910 --> 24:36.044
That's right.
If the unsub can't watch,

24:36.145 --> 24:38.513
he will not select
that car and driver.

24:38.614 --> 24:40.862
Law enforcement also
needs to understand

24:40.910 --> 24:43.082
that the drivers of these
vehicles are victims.

24:43.215 --> 24:44.995
They are unable
to control the vehicles

24:45.043 --> 24:46.153
they appear to be driving.

24:46.285 --> 24:48.523
Ok. That's it.

24:53.684 --> 24:55.153
Everything ok?

24:55.239 --> 24:57.629
No. I just heard from
Jack Garrett from the I.R.T.

24:57.693 --> 24:59.259
We have a problem.

25:02.871 --> 25:05.340
Well, at least
we got a heads-up.

25:05.559 --> 25:07.059
Thanks.

25:08.567 --> 25:10.077
Everything ok?

25:10.996 --> 25:12.280
That was Emily.

25:12.457 --> 25:14.182
About Reid?

25:14.981 --> 25:17.847
She got some intel
on the progress

25:17.895 --> 25:20.522
on the Mexican
murder investigation.

25:20.778 --> 25:23.291
They found the murder weapon.

25:24.223 --> 25:27.199
It has Reid's
blood and prints on it.

25:36.323 --> 25:37.660
What's going on?

25:39.411 --> 25:40.676
Whoa.

25:40.881 --> 25:42.762
What-what-what-what-what...

25:45.149 --> 25:47.565
Move! Move! Look out! Look out!

25:48.686 --> 25:50.519
Aah!

25:55.062 --> 25:55.945
Did you hear?

25:55.993 --> 25:57.018
That's why I'm here.
How did you hear?

25:57.065 --> 25:57.866
I get a call...

25:57.914 --> 25:59.134
Wait, no.
I withdraw the question.

25:59.181 --> 26:00.280
It's better for me not to know.

26:00.327 --> 26:01.124
How bad is this?

26:01.172 --> 26:02.788
Oh, we need to talk to Spencer.

26:02.898 --> 26:04.183
They found the knife?

26:04.280 --> 26:05.304
Where?

26:05.382 --> 26:06.445
In the desert.

26:06.640 --> 26:08.480
The theory is that you
tossed it out the window

26:08.546 --> 26:09.906
of the stolen car
during the chase.

26:09.976 --> 26:12.015
It must have been whoever was
in the car you were chasing.

26:12.062 --> 26:14.546
But that car and its
driver are in the wind.

26:14.695 --> 26:16.874
The blood and prints
on the knife are yours.

26:17.398 --> 26:18.864
This is bad.

26:18.937 --> 26:20.241
There's more.

26:20.594 --> 26:21.588
The blade on the murder weapon

26:21.636 --> 26:23.757
is consistent with the blade
that cut your hand.

26:32.268 --> 26:34.535
Aah!

26:38.227 --> 26:39.426
Ah!

26:39.507 --> 26:41.070
It means that
the 2-to 5-year deal

26:41.140 --> 26:44.190
You didn't want want this
morning is no longer an option.

26:44.429 --> 26:46.577
The new offer's 5 to 10 years.

26:47.038 --> 26:48.273
Oh, my God.

26:48.343 --> 26:49.827
And it's an exploding offer.

26:49.905 --> 26:52.085
That means that you have until
the arraignment to take it.

26:52.132 --> 26:55.530
If you leave it, there
won't be any more offers.

26:55.773 --> 26:56.869
You'll go to trial.

26:56.999 --> 26:59.898
And if he loses,
he gets 25 to life?

27:01.374 --> 27:03.226
Do you remember anything more

27:03.343 --> 27:04.643
About how you got that cut?

27:04.691 --> 27:06.702
I'm trying,
but I can't remember.

27:06.890 --> 27:08.749
And I'm not taking the offer.

27:08.960 --> 27:11.616
I understand what's at stake.
I'm not taking it.

27:12.132 --> 27:13.972
May I have a moment alone
with Spencer, please?

27:14.147 --> 27:16.047
Of course.

27:25.577 --> 27:28.367
The woman, Veronica Perotta,

27:28.632 --> 27:30.421
she was pronounced dead
at the scene.

27:30.546 --> 27:31.765
She fit our physical type?

27:31.851 --> 27:32.726
Yeah.

27:32.851 --> 27:34.413
What about the driver?

27:34.609 --> 27:36.968
Tim Dellinger. He
didn't make it either.

27:37.124 --> 27:39.670
He suffered a brain
bleed during surgery

27:39.718 --> 27:41.280
and died on the table.

27:41.593 --> 27:43.649
No apparent connection
between the two.

27:43.913 --> 27:46.076
But we're not sure,
so we can't be certain

27:46.124 --> 27:48.804
the driver wasn't
in control of the vehicle.

27:55.585 --> 27:59.304
Radio's tuned to 98.2 wuko.

27:59.859 --> 28:01.741
That's our boy.

28:02.421 --> 28:05.638
Please, just think about it.

28:05.905 --> 28:08.655
Think about the evidence.

28:09.163 --> 28:11.054
I know. Scratch
dots his is

28:11.132 --> 28:12.882
and crosses his ts.
We know that.

28:13.070 --> 28:14.937
But a jury won't.

28:15.280 --> 28:18.651
A jury will only see what
Scratch wants them to see.

28:18.820 --> 28:20.530
You think they'll convict me?

28:20.773 --> 28:22.121
I don't know.

28:22.585 --> 28:24.304
But if they do,

28:24.392 --> 28:26.195
5 years...

28:26.360 --> 28:27.447
That's doable.

28:27.495 --> 28:28.627
You are young.

28:28.675 --> 28:29.976
You can have a life after that.

28:30.031 --> 28:31.351
Not as an FBI Agent.

28:31.413 --> 28:33.766
I'd be a convicted felon.

28:34.007 --> 28:37.449
Yes. But you'd be free.

28:38.648 --> 28:41.882
The FBI is my home.
It's where I belong.

28:42.570 --> 28:45.327
You don't belong in prison.

28:46.030 --> 28:49.999
And if you play
Russian roulette with this...

28:50.562 --> 28:53.523
25 years.

28:54.132 --> 28:56.757
That is a lifetime.

28:58.359 --> 29:00.273
If Scratch is framing me,

29:00.460 --> 29:02.315
You guys will get him.
I know you will.

29:02.363 --> 29:03.662
Yes, we will.

29:03.780 --> 29:05.764
I promise you
we will never give up.

29:05.921 --> 29:07.757
And we will exonerate you.

29:07.868 --> 29:10.140
But what if we can't
do that this week?

29:10.241 --> 29:13.835
Or this year?
Or this...

29:14.756 --> 29:16.327
Decade?

29:16.445 --> 29:17.866
Because I know we can't do it

29:17.957 --> 29:20.024
before your arraignment.

29:22.132 --> 29:24.450
What do I do?

29:27.499 --> 29:29.585
I don't know.

29:30.609 --> 29:33.158
But I'm scared for you.

29:35.296 --> 29:37.363
So am I.

29:43.805 --> 29:46.478
There has to be
some kind of connection

29:46.564 --> 29:49.424
between the unsub
and Veronica Perotta.

29:49.650 --> 29:51.376
I mean, he targeted her
outside her home.

29:51.424 --> 29:54.813
He had to have some knowledge
of her daily routine.

29:54.861 --> 29:57.057
This... this was personal.

29:57.138 --> 29:59.743
I'm looking through
Veronica's social media now.

29:59.791 --> 30:02.009
She was single.
She had recently joined

30:02.057 --> 30:04.490
something called
Amorous Intrigue.

30:04.611 --> 30:05.735
The dating website.

30:05.783 --> 30:07.064
Oh. Is that
what it is?

30:07.268 --> 30:08.394
Good. Maybe I
should try it.

30:08.463 --> 30:09.900
Not that I'd want to join
something you know about

30:09.947 --> 30:11.626
Or I'd need a dating website,

30:11.674 --> 30:12.598
'cause I don't.

30:12.600 --> 30:15.072
If the unsub
needed a dating website,

30:15.143 --> 30:16.501
it was because he had
trouble meeting women.

30:16.548 --> 30:19.103
Well, let's see
if she was dating anybody

30:19.150 --> 30:21.346
on Amorous Intrigue.

30:21.494 --> 30:23.143
Well, she was pinged
a few times,

30:23.260 --> 30:25.002
But those conversations
didn't go anywhere.

30:25.111 --> 30:25.985
Wait, here's somebody.

30:26.033 --> 30:27.283
Jonathan Rhodes.

30:27.557 --> 30:30.111
He pinged her 3...
Nope, 4 times.

30:30.228 --> 30:32.298
She ignored him. She
must have rejected him

30:32.346 --> 30:33.291
just off his profile.

30:33.361 --> 30:34.791
Well, what's weird
about his profile?

30:34.838 --> 30:36.220
- Can you pull it up?
- Yeah.

30:36.268 --> 30:38.970
Jonathan enjoys games
of the video variety,

30:39.018 --> 30:40.423
Mostly single-shooter
and...

30:40.471 --> 30:42.127
Driving games.

30:42.129 --> 30:44.338
Uh, he's into computers,

30:44.439 --> 30:47.232
And he was a sound tech engineer
at a local radio station.

30:47.280 --> 30:48.305
Let me guess.

30:48.353 --> 30:49.502
Wuko.

30:49.588 --> 30:50.634
Yeah, that's the one.

30:50.682 --> 30:52.212
After she blew him off,

30:52.260 --> 30:54.166
He cyber-stalked
Veronica for months.

30:54.275 --> 30:57.041
Who else rejected Jonathan's
pings on Amorous Intrigue?

30:57.182 --> 30:58.118
I don't know.
He didn't really

30:58.166 --> 30:58.986
put himself out there that much.

30:59.034 --> 31:01.434
Well, that would only
intensify the rejections.

31:02.002 --> 31:04.244
Here's somebody. Alyssa Miles.
Totally his type.

31:04.463 --> 31:06.338
That's his next target.
Can you pull up an address?

31:06.385 --> 31:07.807
Yep. Just sent it
to your phone.

31:07.888 --> 31:09.877
All right. Grab your laptop, hotshot.
Let's go.

31:09.925 --> 31:11.189
- I'm good.
- Come on.

31:11.471 --> 31:12.682
I don't go with.

31:12.741 --> 31:14.974
I don't.
I'm precious cargo.

31:31.838 --> 31:33.189
Hi, Alyssa.

31:33.322 --> 31:34.994
Who the hell are you?

31:35.728 --> 31:37.846
I, uh, thought
it was time we met.

31:38.072 --> 31:39.463
Do I know you?

31:40.783 --> 31:42.822
I won't be ignored, Alyssa.

31:43.907 --> 31:44.915
No...

31:45.123 --> 31:47.814
No! Aah!

31:47.924 --> 31:50.486
Please! Let me go! Aah!

31:50.534 --> 31:51.534
No!

32:07.728 --> 32:08.774
Hey, Luke.

32:08.822 --> 32:10.223
We're at Alyssa's house.

32:10.400 --> 32:12.502
Car's here.
No signs of a struggle.

32:12.550 --> 32:13.377
I think he abducted her.

32:13.425 --> 32:15.399
The local P.D. says
he's not in his apartment

32:15.447 --> 32:16.346
and his car's gone.

32:16.400 --> 32:18.448
So then why the change
in the modus operandi?

32:18.533 --> 32:19.768
It's part of his escalation.

32:19.852 --> 32:21.588
It's not enough for
him to watch anymore.

32:21.643 --> 32:23.346
What he craves
is physical contact.

32:23.486 --> 32:24.510
His confidence is up.

32:24.635 --> 32:26.291
He was ready to step out
of the shadows.

32:26.339 --> 32:27.672
He needs to be a part of it,

32:27.793 --> 32:29.900
and he wants to experience
the moment of impact,

32:29.963 --> 32:31.971
even if it means
he doesn't walk away from it.

32:32.103 --> 32:34.596
We need an APB and to figure
out where he's taking her.

32:34.689 --> 32:36.964
Well, in order to have an all-points
bulletin, I need to have points.

32:37.011 --> 32:40.971
and he has hacked into the DMV
and deleted his entire account.

32:41.064 --> 32:43.455
So I can't find
a car he's registered to,

32:43.596 --> 32:44.596
let alone a license.

32:44.677 --> 32:46.876
Well, he's gotta drive
a 2013 Meridian.

32:46.878 --> 32:48.278
Those were his first crashes.

32:48.353 --> 32:50.103
Right. And he chose those

32:50.197 --> 32:51.760
Because he already figured
out how to hack his own.

32:51.807 --> 32:53.432
That makes sense.
That narrows it down.

32:53.518 --> 32:57.299
Cross-check all the plates of
2013 Meridians with named owners.

32:57.408 --> 33:00.314
The one without a specified
owner is our unsub.

33:01.088 --> 33:03.214
Stop staring at me
when I'm search engining!

33:03.262 --> 33:04.561
- Sorry.
- It's weird.

33:04.713 --> 33:07.212
Uh... I got it.
It's a vanity plate...

33:07.260 --> 33:09.666
Wuko... I'm sending
the apb now.

33:10.736 --> 33:16.273
[romantic music
playing on radio]

33:16.353 --> 33:18.166
Please let me go.

33:18.277 --> 33:21.533
- Just drive. It's ok.
- Ok.

33:21.682 --> 33:23.079
Just enjoy the ride.

33:23.283 --> 33:25.064
There you go.

33:25.451 --> 33:28.900
Why are you doing this?
Why are you doing this?

33:29.096 --> 33:31.978
Please just let me pull over.

33:35.291 --> 33:37.033
I'm sorry.

33:37.229 --> 33:40.978
I'm sorry that I
ignored your pings.

33:41.564 --> 33:44.633
Hey, I forgive you.

33:46.405 --> 33:49.239
Please, the brakes...
The brakes aren't working.

33:49.439 --> 33:52.939
The brakes aren't working!
The brakes aren't working.

33:53.077 --> 33:54.252
Shh...

33:54.525 --> 33:55.814
How are you doing this?

33:55.948 --> 33:57.143
Don't, please.

33:57.268 --> 33:58.536
Just enjoy the ride.

33:58.584 --> 34:00.784
Ok.

34:02.432 --> 34:04.221
Don't look down.

34:04.885 --> 34:06.990
Keep your eyes on the road.

34:08.713 --> 34:13.829
We're going too fast.
We're going too fast!

34:18.884 --> 34:22.072
He's disabled the GPS, so
we can't find him that way.

34:22.174 --> 34:23.516
I need another way in.

34:23.563 --> 34:25.783
Well, can you hack
directly into the car?

34:25.893 --> 34:27.400
Well, of course I've
already tried that

34:27.447 --> 34:28.860
Because that's,
you know, what I do,

34:28.909 --> 34:32.478
but he's put a firewall around the
vehicle's controller area network.

34:32.617 --> 34:35.150
Well, it looks like Alyssa
managed to keep her phone.

34:35.213 --> 34:36.721
So if she has it on her,
then maybe you could...

34:36.768 --> 34:38.721
Yeah, yeah, that's helpful.
You're helpful sometimes.

34:38.768 --> 34:41.728
Uh... She's disabled
the location services,

34:41.885 --> 34:44.400
But I can easily override that.

34:44.697 --> 34:46.072
They're two miles west of here,

34:46.228 --> 34:47.719
Heading north
on the Fremont Parkway.

34:47.768 --> 34:49.924
All right, we got this.
Let's hit it.

34:50.703 --> 34:53.620
I'm coming, coming, coming.
I'm coming. I'm coming.

35:00.378 --> 35:01.896
Ohh! Ohh!

35:02.047 --> 35:04.248
Slow down! Slow down!
Slow down!

35:04.443 --> 35:07.185
Please slow down.

35:11.755 --> 35:13.646
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
- Just drive!

35:13.758 --> 35:15.404
Where are we going?

35:15.638 --> 35:17.928
It's a surprise.

35:24.536 --> 35:26.560
I've got eyes on him.
Up there. You see?

35:26.701 --> 35:29.706
Do you have to be so lurchy?

35:29.786 --> 35:31.552
I get Carsick.

35:37.216 --> 35:38.914
Like what's his endgame here?

35:38.916 --> 35:42.013
You know, previously he hijacked
a car to target a woman.

35:42.185 --> 35:45.224
Now he's got the target
in the car with him.

35:46.990 --> 35:48.373
Garcia, I think
he's gonna crash.

35:48.443 --> 35:49.943
Where does that road go?

35:50.083 --> 35:51.301
A crash site, literally.

35:51.349 --> 35:52.778
It t-bones into a loading dock

35:52.826 --> 35:53.762
about a mile and half up.

35:53.765 --> 35:54.765
Hang on.

35:54.880 --> 35:56.623
Oh, my God!

35:56.763 --> 35:58.001
Notify local P.D.

35:58.003 --> 35:59.692
I already let
Bradenton P.D. Know.

35:59.740 --> 36:00.737
Garcia, I need you to hack it.

36:00.739 --> 36:02.006
I'm in the middle of hacking it.

36:02.053 --> 36:03.795
Don't tell me I need to hack
it when I'm hacking it, ok?

36:03.842 --> 36:05.176
He's just... he's very good.

36:05.224 --> 36:07.098
He's not as good
as you. Ok?

36:07.146 --> 36:08.341
Now you just focus.

36:08.389 --> 36:09.403
- And hurry.
- Ok.

36:09.451 --> 36:11.857
Oh, God, oh, God, I cannot
die in this car with you.

36:11.905 --> 36:13.599
Nobody's gonna
die today, all right?

36:13.699 --> 36:15.099
Ok.

36:21.425 --> 36:23.326
Oh, my God, you gotta slow down.

36:23.560 --> 36:26.427
You gotta slow down,
we're gonna crash.

36:26.702 --> 36:28.456
Garcia, we're running
out of road here.

36:28.512 --> 36:30.607
I'm throwing a second ECU
into Boomtron Mode.

36:30.655 --> 36:32.222
I think I got in.

36:39.344 --> 36:40.844
No, no, no.

36:40.845 --> 36:41.978
No. No.

36:41.979 --> 36:44.114
What happened?

36:44.115 --> 36:45.749
What happened?! No!

36:45.751 --> 36:46.916
No, no!

36:48.053 --> 36:49.789
Hands up!
Let me see your hands!

36:49.898 --> 36:52.454
Now! Let me see your hands.

37:07.906 --> 37:11.367
Loss of control
is always the source of fear.

37:11.687 --> 37:16.078
It is also, however,
always the source of change.

37:16.336 --> 37:17.969
James Frey.

37:18.017 --> 37:21.250
I'm sorry I'm so late
getting home.

37:21.367 --> 37:24.787
It's just... everything
got complicated.

37:25.687 --> 37:28.133
No, it's... it's not
your fault, mom.

37:28.203 --> 37:31.795
None of this
is your fault. Ok?

37:32.562 --> 37:35.966
JJ said she brought
the boys by to see you.

37:36.680 --> 37:39.359
I know.

37:40.336 --> 37:42.031
Well, she's gonna...
She's gonna come by

37:42.164 --> 37:43.506
and see you every day.

37:43.851 --> 37:45.390
Yeah.

37:46.867 --> 37:49.695
Not... maybe, I hope so.

37:50.180 --> 37:52.182
Look, mom, all you need to know

37:52.430 --> 37:56.820
is that I'm safe
and I have a great lawyer.

37:57.414 --> 38:01.220
Yeah, she's... she's great.
She's really great.

38:02.289 --> 38:04.794
I know. I know.

38:05.133 --> 38:07.998
It's not going to be forever.

38:08.531 --> 38:12.235
I promise.
I promise you'll be ok.

38:12.292 --> 38:14.225
So will I.

38:18.922 --> 38:21.226
Don't cry, mom, I'm ok.

38:21.390 --> 38:26.682
I'm ok. Everything
is gonna be ok.

38:27.164 --> 38:30.890
I love you...
I love you so much.

38:31.061 --> 38:33.061
Ok. Bye.

38:40.070 --> 38:41.828
I'm on my way there.

38:42.055 --> 38:44.250
Yeah. Right.

38:44.547 --> 38:47.211
I'm so glad you made it in
time for the arraignment.

38:47.305 --> 38:48.922
What did the kid
decide about a plea?

38:49.047 --> 38:51.106
I don't know.
I'm not sure he does.

38:51.242 --> 38:53.133
I can't stand the thought
of him being in prison.

38:53.180 --> 38:56.211
But 5 years is a lot
less time than 25.

38:56.351 --> 38:58.680
He must be agonizing
over this decision.

38:58.742 --> 39:00.961
Well, whatever he decides,
he has our full support.

39:01.570 --> 39:03.437
He knows that.
It means a lot to him.

39:03.500 --> 39:05.350
We have to prove
that Scratch did this.

39:05.398 --> 39:06.867
We'll get him.

39:07.649 --> 39:09.445
They're calling his case.

39:11.630 --> 39:15.345
Case number 149-cr 0308,

39:15.439 --> 39:17.200
U.S. Versus Reid.

39:18.056 --> 39:21.259
Ms. Duncan, your client
is an FBI agent, correct?

39:21.377 --> 39:23.077
That's right, your honor.

39:26.431 --> 39:27.797
You're charged with murder,

39:27.845 --> 39:29.433
Which is a very serious matter.

39:29.481 --> 39:30.978
Yes, your honor.

39:32.528 --> 39:33.649
All right, Ms. Duncan,

39:33.697 --> 39:35.541
Does your client wish
to enter a plea at this time?

39:35.588 --> 39:36.618
He does.

39:36.666 --> 39:38.166
And how do you plead,
agent Reid?

39:38.214 --> 39:39.243
Not guilty.

39:39.291 --> 39:40.056
Thank God.

39:40.104 --> 39:41.517
And as to bail?

39:41.593 --> 39:43.963
The people oppose bail and
request remand, your honor.

39:44.056 --> 39:46.296
Your honor, my client
presents no risk of flight.

39:46.400 --> 39:48.579
That's ridiculous. The
defendant was arrested

39:48.627 --> 39:50.924
after fleeing the
murder scene in Mexico.

39:51.095 --> 39:52.752
Those were extenuating
circumstances.

39:52.861 --> 39:54.369
He'd been drugged
against his will.

39:54.494 --> 39:57.704
By failing to notify the FBI
of his international travel,

39:57.752 --> 39:59.744
the defendant violated
the bureau protocol.

39:59.853 --> 40:01.689
My client presents
no flight risk.

40:01.869 --> 40:03.814
He has deep ties
in this community.

40:03.916 --> 40:05.783
His mother suffers from
Alzheimer's disease

40:05.845 --> 40:07.791
And Schizophrenia
and lives with him.

40:07.892 --> 40:10.228
He is solely responsible
for her well-being.

40:10.330 --> 40:12.361
Additionally, he's been
a decorated SSA

40:12.431 --> 40:14.822
with the FBI's behavioral
analysis unit for over a decade.

40:14.900 --> 40:17.736
And as an FBI agent, he has
contacts all over the world.

40:17.853 --> 40:20.162
Agent Reid would be willing
to turn over both his personal

40:20.299 --> 40:21.486
and government issued passports.

40:21.533 --> 40:23.447
If he wanted
a counterfeit passport,

40:23.564 --> 40:24.908
he could easily get one.

40:25.025 --> 40:26.690
He has no criminal history.

40:26.738 --> 40:28.627
The defendant
is uniquely situated

40:28.689 --> 40:30.892
to evade law enforcement should
he flee the jurisdiction.

40:30.939 --> 40:33.158
Your honor, he wants to stay
here and clear his good name.

40:33.205 --> 40:34.231
He should have thought
about his good name

40:34.278 --> 40:35.812
before sneaking
across the border.

40:35.892 --> 40:37.330
I'm prepared to present

40:37.416 --> 40:38.947
multiple law enforcement
character witnesses

40:38.994 --> 40:40.439
on his behalf right now.

40:40.525 --> 40:41.947
The witnesses are here
in the courtroom,

40:41.994 --> 40:43.791
all highly respected FBI Agents.

40:43.908 --> 40:45.447
Simmer down, Ms. Duncan.

40:45.634 --> 40:47.408
It's almost 6:00
and I'm not inclined

40:47.463 --> 40:49.279
to hear from
character witnesses.

40:49.478 --> 40:52.362
Actions speak louder
than words, I always say.

40:52.502 --> 40:54.658
We'd be willing
to abide by a curfew

40:54.799 --> 40:56.999
and strict monitoring of his
whereabouts at all times.

40:57.001 --> 40:58.697
Too little too late, counselor.

40:58.791 --> 41:01.580
If past behavior is the best
indicator of future conduct,

41:01.705 --> 41:03.502
and I do believe it is,

41:03.619 --> 41:06.939
Then your client
present a flight risk.

41:07.158 --> 41:08.775
Bail is denied.

41:08.986 --> 41:11.346
Defendant will be remanded to
federal custody pending trial.

41:13.166 --> 41:14.947
How long before
his case goes to trail?

41:15.041 --> 41:16.452
It's a complicated case.
3 months.

41:16.500 --> 41:17.967
Sir.

41:22.939 --> 41:26.384
Spencer, I'm sorry. I will come
and see you as soon as I can.
