Roger, hurry up,
you slowpoke.

01:15.250 --> 01:17.500
This basket is getting
heavier by the minute.

01:19.120 --> 01:22.000
Come on,
let go, big fella.

01:24.290 --> 01:26.290
No premature picnicking.

01:26.290 --> 01:28.790
We can't eat
until we find a spot.

01:28.790 --> 01:31.670
My stomach votes
for right here.

01:31.670 --> 01:33.710
Picnics aren't about food.

01:33.710 --> 01:37.000
They're about sunshine
and fresh air.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.000
-And fog!

01:39.000 --> 01:40.920
Anita:
Where'd all this come from?

01:40.920 --> 01:43.170
Wait up!
I-I can't see you!

01:59.080 --> 02:01.080
Roger: Oh, wow.

02:01.080 --> 02:04.080
Something tells me
we're not in Grutely any more.

02:05.880 --> 02:07.880
Roger:
DeVilville?

02:07.880 --> 02:10.290
Aww, I should have guessed
Cruella was behind this.

02:10.290 --> 02:13.290
But, Roger,
we're a half-mile
from home

02:13.290 --> 02:15.290
and there was
nothing here yesterday.

02:15.290 --> 02:18.170
Even her millions couldn't
build all this over night.

02:18.170 --> 02:21.420
Maybe it's a high-concept
housing development.

02:21.420 --> 02:24.120
Yeah, troll estates.

02:26.290 --> 02:28.790
There's only one way
to find out.

02:32.710 --> 02:34.710
Guys, heel! Please!

02:42.380 --> 02:45.210
What is this?
The renaissance fair?

02:45.210 --> 02:48.210
It's all so pastoral.

02:48.210 --> 02:51.790
Anita:
It's kind of a throw-back
to simpler, happier times.

02:51.790 --> 02:53.250
Yeah, it makes me feel

02:53.250 --> 02:55.880
like we've left
all our cares behind.

02:55.880 --> 02:58.170
Both: I love this place.

03:02.380 --> 03:04.880
What's gotten into them?

03:04.880 --> 03:07.500
I have a b-b-bad
feeling about this.

03:09.710 --> 03:11.420
Oh, papa!

03:11.420 --> 03:14.830
I think I found
the meaning of life!

03:16.250 --> 03:19.170
Might I be offering you
a wee morsel

03:19.170 --> 03:22.040
this fine mornin', beastie?

03:28.920 --> 03:30.830
Would you like
to come inside

03:30.830 --> 03:32.580
and sample more
of me wares?

03:35.420 --> 03:37.710
What have I
always told you?

03:37.710 --> 03:40.670
If you can dream it,
you can achieve it.

03:40.670 --> 03:42.000
-Man: Whoa there, now.

03:56.330 --> 03:58.960
You drive like
a feeble old goat!

03:58.960 --> 04:01.170
Back to the stable with you!

04:01.170 --> 04:04.080
I have business
with the local fools.

04:04.080 --> 04:07.920
Nice guy,
must be on a lunch break
from the inquisition.

04:07.920 --> 04:10.580
Ooh, that guy
gives me the shivers.

04:10.580 --> 04:13.170
I know I've seen him before.

04:13.170 --> 04:15.380
W

04:15.380 --> 04:17.830
-Coachman: Horses, hyah!

04:19.500 --> 04:20.960
Where's he going?

04:20.960 --> 04:23.750
Spot:
There's something strange
about this place.

04:25.040 --> 04:26.250
I'll say.

04:26.250 --> 04:28.290
No telephones,
no electricity,

04:28.290 --> 04:29.920
no smog,

04:29.920 --> 04:32.670
this must be some sort
of cutting-edge,

04:32.670 --> 04:34.920
pro-environmental commune.

04:34.920 --> 04:37.960
I wonder where
they keep the organic garden.

04:37.960 --> 04:39.920
I can't shake the feeling

04:39.920 --> 04:41.960
something creepy's
about to happen.

04:43.210 --> 04:44.460
A chicken?

04:48.460 --> 04:51.830
Keep out of my town,
you filthy bird.

04:51.830 --> 04:53.750
I hate chickens!

05:06.420 --> 05:09.420
Now I remember
where I saw that guy.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.380
Spot:
I know he's
in here somewhere.

05:17.290 --> 05:19.120
Amoeba De Vil.

05:19.120 --> 05:21.420
Ugg-Lee De Vil.

05:21.420 --> 05:23.380
Caligula De Vil.

05:23.380 --> 05:25.790
Sir Owen De Vil--

05:28.960 --> 05:30.250
That's him, all right.

05:30.250 --> 05:35.670
Judge Dimsdale De Vil,
born 1631.

05:35.670 --> 05:36.960
That would make him--

05:36.960 --> 05:38.880
Let's see, nine minus three,

05:38.880 --> 05:40.620
carry the two over
the tens column--

05:41.880 --> 05:44.000
A ghost! A zombie!

05:44.000 --> 05:46.290
An evil spirit doomed to walk
among the living!

05:46.290 --> 05:48.920
And worse still,
he's related to Cruella.

05:48.920 --> 05:50.920
I got to get back
and warn everyone.

05:53.670 --> 05:58.620
-That's my very bestest baby.

05:58.620 --> 06:00.710
Everybody needs exercise.

06:00.710 --> 06:04.000
I get mine,
exercising my iron will.

06:05.960 --> 06:08.080
Huh? Yummy!

06:12.000 --> 06:13.380
Scorch!

06:13.380 --> 06:16.750
-Slow down!

06:18.920 --> 06:21.540
-Scorch!

06:21.540 --> 06:23.830
Darling, cease!

06:26.620 --> 06:29.170
Scorch!

06:36.500 --> 06:38.790
Scorch, Stop!

06:38.790 --> 06:40.000
I'll buy you a chicken,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.170
a whole herd of chickens,

06:42.170 --> 06:44.670
your own chicken franchise!

06:47.830 --> 06:51.170
-Aye, that's a good one, laddie!

06:51.170 --> 06:53.460
Roger:
Do you think it's time
to find the pups

06:53.460 --> 06:55.420
-Oh, Roger.

06:55.420 --> 06:57.960
This whole village
is so charming.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.920
I don't ever want to leave.

06:59.920 --> 07:02.040
I know what you mean.

07:02.040 --> 07:03.920
I could stay here forever.

07:03.920 --> 07:05.920
Both:
I love this place.

07:10.710 --> 07:13.750
Butcher:
Oh, oh, so soon,
wee beastie?

07:13.750 --> 07:15.880
We've only sampled
the bratwurst,

07:15.880 --> 07:17.580
knackwurst,
and liverwurst.

07:17.580 --> 07:19.960
Won't you be staying
for the best

07:23.040 --> 07:25.290
Slow down!
Stop!

07:28.500 --> 07:31.040
What?!

07:35.830 --> 07:37.790
What is this place?

07:37.790 --> 07:40.830
I don't remember
anything being out here?

07:40.830 --> 07:42.540
DeVilville?

07:42.540 --> 07:45.960
How dare
someone use my name
without permission.

07:45.960 --> 07:48.540
I'm going to find out
who's in charge here,

07:48.540 --> 07:50.330
and sue!

07:53.670 --> 07:55.540
Female puppy:
The way you've been
staring at me

07:55.540 --> 07:56.920
all afternoon,

07:56.920 --> 07:58.880
it's like you've never
seen a lass before.

07:58.880 --> 08:01.420
I've never seen
a girl like you, Rebecca.

08:01.420 --> 08:03.080
You're so different.

08:03.080 --> 08:05.880
Are there no carriage hounds
where you come from then?

08:05.880 --> 08:07.500
No, there aren't.

08:07.500 --> 08:10.670
What do dalmatians do then?

08:10.670 --> 08:14.040
Lots of things.
I like to watch TV,

08:14.040 --> 08:15.830
love TV,

08:15.830 --> 08:18.460
can't get enough TV.

08:18.460 --> 08:19.710
What's TV?

08:19.710 --> 08:21.500
Huh, that's funny.

08:21.500 --> 08:23.330
I don't remember.

08:30.710 --> 08:34.620
You, rabble over there,
who's in charge here?

08:34.620 --> 08:38.000
Ah, that would be me,

08:38.000 --> 08:40.710
Judge Dimsdale De Vil!

08:43.880 --> 08:46.250
That's-- that's not possible.

08:46.250 --> 08:48.750
That was the name
of one of my ancestors

08:48.750 --> 08:50.330
centuries ago.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.750
So you too are a De Vil?

08:52.750 --> 08:56.620
I should have known
by that handsome head of hair.

08:56.620 --> 08:59.880
Can't you tell, lass?
I'm your flesh and blood

08:59.880 --> 09:01.620
in the flesh.

09:04.790 --> 09:07.120
Are you really my ancestor?

09:07.120 --> 09:08.750
Aye, lass.

09:08.750 --> 09:11.290
Come all the way
through the mists of time

09:11.290 --> 09:13.290
and brought
my whole town with me.

09:15.830 --> 09:17.290
Why?

09:17.290 --> 09:18.880
That is a very long story,

09:18.880 --> 09:21.170
-which started very long ago.

09:23.080 --> 09:25.620
- Over 300 years ago,
I was appointed...

09:25.620 --> 09:28.750
-the tax collector
of this little village.

09:28.750 --> 09:32.250
My favorite part
was the audits.

09:32.250 --> 09:35.000
-How many times do I have
to tell you people?

09:35.000 --> 09:38.750
Use form 1040E
for itemized deductions!

09:52.170 --> 09:53.670
I was so ruthless,

09:53.670 --> 09:55.960
soon more titles
were added to my name:

09:55.960 --> 10:01.000
Sheriff, Judge,
and finally Lord Mayor.

10:02.500 --> 10:03.670
-Like a true De Vil,

10:03.670 --> 10:06.580
I ran the town
with an iron fist,

10:06.580 --> 10:10.330
and I squeezed every bit
of money out of the locals.

10:10.330 --> 10:12.080
Life was good...

10:12.080 --> 10:14.670
-until that fateful day.

10:18.710 --> 10:21.750
Hester Hen,
the town witch,
showed up.

10:21.750 --> 10:24.790
I can read your black heart,
Dimsdale De Vil.

10:24.790 --> 10:28.540
You won't rest a day
until you own the whole
wide world.

10:28.540 --> 10:31.460
Since no one
in this misbegotten town

10:31.460 --> 10:33.750
has the backbone to stop ye,

10:33.750 --> 10:36.620
it looks like that task
falls to me.

10:38.670 --> 10:40.580
-And Katrina.

10:43.170 --> 10:46.420
To keep the world safe
from his wickedness--

10:46.420 --> 10:48.750
that is the evil De Vil--

10:48.750 --> 10:51.620
may this whole
miserable village

10:51.620 --> 10:54.040
vanish from
the face of the Earth,

10:54.040 --> 10:57.210
only to return
for one day

10:57.210 --> 10:59.500
every 100 years.

10:59.500 --> 11:03.380
And may the townsfolk
be bewitched

11:03.380 --> 11:05.670
and mindlessly happy,

11:05.670 --> 11:09.960
just to make De Vil
all the more miserable

11:09.960 --> 11:11.960
in comparison.

11:11.960 --> 11:15.750
Whew! Whew!
I guess that
about covers it.

11:17.120 --> 11:18.750
Thank you, Katrina.

11:18.750 --> 11:20.290
I almost forgot.

11:20.290 --> 11:24.380
And on risk of death
may the evil De Vil

11:24.380 --> 11:26.960
be bound within
the town's borders

11:26.960 --> 11:28.710
-to spend eternity...

11:28.710 --> 11:30.580
in this prison
of his own making.

11:30.580 --> 11:34.040
-This curse I place on you

11:34.040 --> 11:37.330
and everything in
this Podunk town

11:37.330 --> 11:40.420
-that bears your name...

11:41.710 --> 11:44.500
except for chickens,
of course.

11:46.040 --> 11:49.000
Argh, take a hike,
you old hag!

11:54.790 --> 11:57.210
And true to Hester's curse,

11:57.210 --> 11:59.790
at the dawn of the next day,

11:59.790 --> 12:02.920
it was 100 years later.

12:02.920 --> 12:05.250
And anyone who
wanders into town

12:05.250 --> 12:07.620
will fall under Hester's curse?

12:07.620 --> 12:09.250
Except De Vils

12:09.250 --> 12:10.620
and chickens.

12:10.620 --> 12:13.830
Hmm, and how about them?

12:16.170 --> 12:19.750
I love this place.

12:19.750 --> 12:22.750
Aye, they're
already bewitched.

12:22.750 --> 12:24.670
If they're
still here at dusk,

12:24.670 --> 12:27.290
they'll disappear
with the rest of DeVilville.

12:27.290 --> 12:29.540
Memo to myself:
Whoopie!

12:29.540 --> 12:31.460
Tomorrow their farm
will be mine.

12:31.460 --> 12:33.290
Say, gramps,

12:33.290 --> 12:35.290
could you do me a big favor
and make sure those two

12:35.290 --> 12:37.170
remain in DeVilville?

12:37.170 --> 12:38.710
If you want,
I'll lock them in the jail.

12:38.710 --> 12:39.920
What's family for?

12:39.920 --> 12:43.790
Oh, thank you,
great-great-great-

12:43.790 --> 12:46.460
great-great-great-granddaddy.

12:46.460 --> 12:48.830
You're the greatest.

12:48.830 --> 12:51.460
They'll all be
trapped in here

12:51.460 --> 12:54.250
for the next 100 years!

12:55.210 --> 12:56.920
I've got to get 'em
out of here!

12:58.670 --> 13:02.120
Anita:
Oh, Judge De Vil,
it's so nice of you

13:02.120 --> 13:04.250
to give us a personal tour.

13:04.250 --> 13:08.880
Anything for friends
of my, uh, uh, niece Cruella.

13:08.880 --> 13:11.580
Why don't you show them
the town jail,

13:11.580 --> 13:13.710
Uncle Dimsdale?

13:13.710 --> 13:15.500
I'd be delighted.

13:15.500 --> 13:16.960
It's this way.

13:18.710 --> 13:21.420
I love this place.

13:25.830 --> 13:27.920
Cadpig:
I never thought I'd say this,

13:27.920 --> 13:30.920
but I've actually found
an ecologically sound

13:30.920 --> 13:32.500
paradise on Earth.

13:33.960 --> 13:36.170
And I never thought
I'd say this,

13:36.170 --> 13:38.960
but I'm full.

13:38.960 --> 13:42.120
Both: I love this place.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.880
There you are!

13:46.880 --> 13:50.580
Dearlys in trouble.

13:50.580 --> 13:53.080
Cruella here!

13:53.080 --> 13:56.420
Dimsdale's evil!

13:56.420 --> 13:59.460
This town is cursed!

13:59.460 --> 14:01.880
Oh, what are
you talking about?

14:01.880 --> 14:04.420
This village is wonderful.

14:04.420 --> 14:07.500
It's the curse
of Hester Hen.

14:07.500 --> 14:10.170
You two are bewitched!

14:14.040 --> 14:18.330
Bewitched?
And I thought I was
full of bologna.

14:32.670 --> 14:35.670
Ah, the water's
so very pure.

14:35.670 --> 14:38.620
Oh, I can't break the spell.

14:38.620 --> 14:41.420
Oh no, what am I gonna do?

14:41.420 --> 14:42.790
What am I gonna do?
I can't--

14:42.790 --> 14:44.500
Wait a minute.

14:44.500 --> 14:48.330
I suppose I could try
the fairy tale approach.

14:52.790 --> 14:55.620
-Chicken lips!

14:57.500 --> 14:59.500
Wait a minute.

14:59.500 --> 15:03.120
This place isn't
ecologically advanced at all.

15:03.120 --> 15:05.290
It's practically Medieval!

15:05.290 --> 15:09.380
Oh! I'm stuffed tighter
than a sausage!

15:09.380 --> 15:12.210
I think I'm gonna be sick!

15:12.210 --> 15:13.920
Ha-Ha! It worked!

15:13.920 --> 15:15.460
It worked!

15:15.460 --> 15:17.040
It's the old story,

15:17.040 --> 15:19.210
kiss a chicken,
break the curse.

15:19.210 --> 15:20.250
Come on, guys!

15:20.250 --> 15:23.120
This beak's got some
serious smooching to do!

15:26.790 --> 15:30.000
And this concludes the tour
of the village stockade.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.620
Isn't this cell cozy?

15:33.620 --> 15:35.920
That was almost too easy.

15:35.920 --> 15:37.540
They're content as cows,

15:37.540 --> 15:40.040
like every other
fool in this town.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.380
Well, I can't
thank you enough,

15:42.380 --> 15:44.790
great-great-great--

15:44.790 --> 15:46.670
uh, whatever.

15:46.670 --> 15:48.750
Oh, I think you can.

15:50.380 --> 15:53.080
What is the meaning of this?

15:53.080 --> 15:54.460
I've been thinking.

15:54.460 --> 15:57.420
When Hester said
the evil De Vil is bound
to the village,

15:57.420 --> 16:00.500
she really didn't specify
which evil De Vil.

16:00.500 --> 16:04.330
So I'm letting you
take my place

16:04.330 --> 16:06.000
in DeVilville forever!

16:06.000 --> 16:07.960
No! Let me out,

16:07.960 --> 16:11.420
you evil, lying,
conniving shyster!

16:11.420 --> 16:13.000
Takes one to know one,

16:13.000 --> 16:15.290
you scheming,
larcenous harpy.

16:15.290 --> 16:17.170
Fare thee well!

16:17.170 --> 16:18.750
It's home
to collect me gold,

16:18.750 --> 16:20.290
and I'm out of here.

16:20.290 --> 16:23.170
Such emotional honesty.

16:23.170 --> 16:25.290
-I love this place.
-I love this place.

16:27.380 --> 16:29.380
Cruella:
Oh, shut up!

16:30.960 --> 16:32.420
Eh! Yuck!

16:32.420 --> 16:34.460
I don't care
who's in trouble.

16:34.460 --> 16:36.380
Did you have to kiss me?

16:36.380 --> 16:38.670
You would never
have believed me
if I didn't.

16:38.670 --> 16:42.330
It's all part
of a horrible,
terrible curse.

16:42.330 --> 16:45.290
And getting kissed
by a chicken is better?

16:45.290 --> 16:47.620
Come on, we have to
go find Roger and Anita

16:47.620 --> 16:49.120
and get out of town.

16:49.120 --> 16:51.040
But why, Lucky?

16:51.040 --> 16:52.540
You could be happy here,

16:52.540 --> 16:54.420
working for
Judge De Vil with me.

16:54.420 --> 16:56.250
He's such a kind man.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.750
Stand back!

16:58.750 --> 17:02.330
This is a job
for my spell-breaking beak.

17:09.380 --> 17:10.750
Are you okay?

17:10.750 --> 17:14.040
I-I feel like I'm coming
out of a dream,

17:14.040 --> 17:16.880
a long, strange dream.

17:16.880 --> 17:18.380
Cadpig:
Excuse me!

17:18.380 --> 17:21.250
We have to hurry.
The sun is going down.

17:22.210 --> 17:24.290
I'm sorry, I have to go.

17:24.290 --> 17:26.250
My pets need me.

17:26.250 --> 17:28.000
I want to help.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.040
I understand now
how wicked my De Vil is.

17:31.040 --> 17:34.040
B-but how will we
get to the jail in time?

17:34.040 --> 17:36.960
I'm a carriage hound.
I know the way.

17:52.290 --> 17:54.290
Whoa!

17:54.290 --> 17:55.330
Hey.

18:21.120 --> 18:25.620
Oh, look, Roger,
the pups have learned
a new trick.

18:25.620 --> 18:29.120
Aww, and they've brought
a new little friend with them.

18:29.120 --> 18:33.080
Such clever puppies.

18:33.080 --> 18:34.960
Anita, quickly,

18:34.960 --> 18:36.250
let me out
of this contraption.

18:36.250 --> 18:37.290
The sun is setting!

18:37.290 --> 18:39.380
Calm down, Cruella.

18:39.380 --> 18:41.290
There's no need to rush.

18:41.290 --> 18:42.750
Is there?

18:44.170 --> 18:48.250
It's almost like Spot's
trying to tell me something.

18:48.250 --> 18:50.620
Out of my way, Ragweed.

18:52.250 --> 18:53.710
Blah!

18:53.710 --> 18:56.290
-Eugh!

18:58.170 --> 18:59.620
What was that?

18:59.620 --> 19:02.880
You know, this town
suddenly gives me the creeps.

19:02.880 --> 19:04.080
Let's get out of here.

19:06.120 --> 19:07.420
I, uh, think they
want us to hurry.

19:07.420 --> 19:09.080
Sounds good to me.

19:11.380 --> 19:14.250
Cruella:
Stop you... De Vil!

19:14.250 --> 19:16.580
You'll never
get away with this.

19:21.080 --> 19:23.540
Try and trap me,
will you!

19:23.540 --> 19:25.290
No!

19:25.290 --> 19:28.670
-Is this-- ow!

19:28.670 --> 19:30.830
any way to-- eeh!

19:30.830 --> 19:33.170
treat a beloved ancestor.

19:36.880 --> 19:39.500
I've got to get out of here.

19:39.500 --> 19:41.080
I'll never let you leave.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.500
What's Cruella doing?

19:45.500 --> 19:50.920
Dearlys!
Somebody, help!

19:53.380 --> 19:55.000
We made it.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.330
Where is everybody?

19:56.330 --> 19:57.790
Huh?

19:57.790 --> 19:59.460
Oh, no.

20:00.750 --> 20:03.080
What's this all about?

20:03.080 --> 20:06.170
Don't talk! Ow! Pull!

20:06.170 --> 20:08.000
Come through
the gate, Rebecca.

20:08.000 --> 20:09.960
I want you
to come with me.

20:09.960 --> 20:13.460
Ugh, I cannot.
I have to stay here.

20:13.460 --> 20:16.290
It looks like it's up
to us dalmatians

20:16.290 --> 20:18.380
to keep the evil
De Vils in check.

20:18.380 --> 20:19.960
No go on with ye.

20:19.960 --> 20:21.670
You have to protect your world,

20:21.670 --> 20:23.540
and I have to protect mine.

20:28.040 --> 20:29.830
Hurry, it's almost dusk!

20:34.170 --> 20:35.750
If I can't leave,
granddaughter,

20:35.750 --> 20:38.000
I-I'm taking you with me.

20:38.000 --> 20:39.830
Pull, Dearlys!

20:39.830 --> 20:43.080
We're losing ground!

20:47.170 --> 20:48.500
We have to help.

20:48.500 --> 20:49.960
They're being
pulled back in.

20:49.960 --> 20:52.750
But we might
get trapped too.

20:52.750 --> 20:56.500
You guys stay here.
I'll take care of this.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.040
-No!
-Whoa!

21:06.750 --> 21:08.290
Cruella: Where am I?

21:10.000 --> 21:11.170
What are you doing here?

21:11.170 --> 21:13.420
I-- I don't know.

21:13.420 --> 21:15.460
The last thing I remember

21:15.460 --> 21:18.920
I was walking Scorchy
in my golf cart.

21:18.920 --> 21:22.290
Oh my gosh,
Roger, the sun's down.

21:22.290 --> 21:24.920
We're we in that fog
all afternoon?

21:24.920 --> 21:27.000
I don't know.

21:28.670 --> 21:30.920
I knew it!

21:30.920 --> 21:34.000
Old Hester Hen
protects her chickens!

21:34.000 --> 21:36.790
Only Spot,
super chicken,

21:36.790 --> 21:39.920
invulnerable to spells,
could save...

21:39.920 --> 21:41.750
the day?

21:41.750 --> 21:46.080
Spot, what are
you raving about?

21:46.080 --> 21:50.170
You know, Dimsdale,
DeVilville, the curse!

21:52.750 --> 21:54.120
The curse?

21:54.120 --> 21:57.000
Gah! It's that tricky spell!

21:57.000 --> 21:58.670
They don't remember a thing!

21:58.670 --> 22:01.540
Wait a minute.
I broke the spell once,

22:01.540 --> 22:03.620
maybe I can do it again.

22:05.210 --> 22:07.920
Hey, come back, you guys!

22:07.920 --> 22:10.960
Once I kiss you,
all will be made clear.
