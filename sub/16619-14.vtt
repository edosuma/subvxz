00:00.398 --> 00:02.609
_

00:04.331 --> 00:06.698
Dylan, this cart goes to 63rd and 6th

00:06.700 --> 00:08.131
as soon as the C-4 is loaded.

00:08.132 --> 00:09.767
But we got a problem with the propane.

00:09.769 --> 00:11.466
I'm gonna need to switch it out.

00:11.468 --> 00:13.671
Freeze! This is the FBI!

00:13.673 --> 00:15.239
Stay where you are!

00:16.175 --> 00:17.141
Don't move!

00:17.143 --> 00:21.279
Put your weapons down!
We have you surrounded!

00:21.281 --> 00:24.148
- We got a runner.
- On it.

00:30.857 --> 00:34.128
Headed past 50th,
towards the embankment.

00:35.862 --> 00:37.795
Mind if I join the party?

00:37.797 --> 00:39.296
Better late than never.

00:39.298 --> 00:41.799
Well, you took off running.
I didn't get a chance.

00:41.801 --> 00:45.168
Oh, I'm sorry. Are we calling dibs or...

00:45.170 --> 00:47.371
Alex?

00:47.373 --> 00:49.206
Alex, what is it? What's wrong?

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:01.853 --> 01:03.820
Freeze!

01:03.822 --> 01:07.256
You were saying something
about "better late than never"?

01:10.194 --> 01:13.396
Ugh, I forgot about the FBI's
physical-fitness requirements.

01:13.398 --> 01:14.831
You may have gotten your badge back,

01:14.833 --> 01:16.225
but you still have to work for it.

01:17.701 --> 01:18.734
- Aha.
- _

01:18.736 --> 01:21.737
I was wondering when the
bat signal would go off.

01:21.739 --> 01:23.004
Your car or mine?

01:23.006 --> 01:25.508
Six-hour drive. If you're offering...

01:25.510 --> 01:28.677
You know, you'd think a
top-secret task force like ours

01:28.679 --> 01:30.546
would have some perks,
a helicopter maybe.

01:30.548 --> 01:32.347
Well, there are perks.

01:32.349 --> 01:34.115
We both get to work
with our ex-boyfriends.

01:34.117 --> 01:35.522
Oh, yay.

01:35.524 --> 01:37.886
What about Nimah? Heard from her?

01:37.888 --> 01:39.721
What, since she wasn't arrested

01:39.723 --> 01:41.924
for aiding and abetting a
domestic act of terrorism?

01:41.926 --> 01:44.726
No, I haven't, and I don't think
that anyone else should, either.

01:44.728 --> 01:47.095
Shelby, she's part of the
team. We can't ignore her.

01:47.097 --> 01:48.296
We can try.

01:48.298 --> 01:50.131
Just for that crack, you're driving.

01:50.133 --> 01:52.767
Ohh.

02:03.947 --> 02:04.779
_

02:13.222 --> 02:14.822
Hey. Where are you going?

02:16.292 --> 02:17.658
_

02:29.572 --> 02:30.804
DéjÃ  vu.

02:30.806 --> 02:32.525
For you, sure.

02:32.527 --> 02:34.108
For me, it's a whole new world.

02:34.110 --> 02:35.676
Hey, I finally get to see The Farm,

02:35.678 --> 02:37.738
the place you've talked
about for way too long now.

02:37.740 --> 02:39.913
It's really not that special.

02:39.915 --> 02:41.581
You told me they have a spa.

02:41.583 --> 02:43.639
That was a rumor. Oh, my God.

02:43.641 --> 02:44.985
Do I have something in my teeth?

02:44.987 --> 02:46.786
No. He's here.

02:46.788 --> 02:48.588
- Who, Ryan?
- Not Ryan.

02:50.993 --> 02:53.627
Caleb? So what?

02:53.629 --> 02:55.428
Alex, I am a big girl.

02:55.430 --> 02:56.429
Besides, it's not like we had

02:56.431 --> 02:58.665
some horrible fight last
time we saw each other.

02:58.667 --> 02:59.748
We're Facebook friends.

02:59.750 --> 03:01.767
We wish each other happy birthday.

03:01.769 --> 03:03.336
Come on. Let's say hello.

03:03.338 --> 03:04.703
Okay.

03:04.705 --> 03:09.242
Well, hey. Fancy bumping into you.

03:10.612 --> 03:12.477
Shelby Wyatt, what are you doing here?

03:12.479 --> 03:13.612
What are you doing here?

03:13.614 --> 03:15.948
You know who I am. Why
would I answer that question?

03:15.950 --> 03:17.983
Well, you know who I am. Why
would I answer that question?

03:17.985 --> 03:19.551
Okay.

03:19.553 --> 03:21.954
Who are you, and how
do you know each other?

03:21.956 --> 03:24.123
Well, even though we've
never formally met...

03:24.125 --> 03:26.291
I think you've formally
met enough of my family.

03:26.293 --> 03:30.061
Okay. This is Caleb's
brother, Clayton Haas.

03:30.063 --> 03:31.896
- Don't ever say that name.
- Excuse me?

03:31.898 --> 03:34.299
You say that name, and...
And I hear you saying

03:34.301 --> 03:36.901
my father's name in places
that no child should ever

03:36.903 --> 03:38.870
have to imagine their
father's name being said,

03:38.872 --> 03:41.239
and then come the images and...

03:41.241 --> 03:43.341
No.

03:43.343 --> 03:45.699
I'm Clay, not Clayton.

03:45.701 --> 03:47.912
And this moment that's
happening right now,

03:47.914 --> 03:49.647
I have gone out of my way

03:49.649 --> 03:52.349
to ensure that it
doesn't happen in my life.

03:52.351 --> 03:53.942
I need to make a call.

03:56.389 --> 03:58.540
Caleb has a brother?

03:58.542 --> 04:00.825
And a sister. She's nice, though.

04:00.827 --> 04:03.019
Well, at least she was
the last time I saw her.

04:03.021 --> 04:05.396
That was before I...

04:05.398 --> 04:07.231
Just... Yeah. Let's drop it.

04:07.233 --> 04:09.667
Claire, we need to talk.

04:09.669 --> 04:11.435
Now.

04:14.707 --> 04:18.041
So, this is The Farm.

04:18.043 --> 04:20.243
You don't seem excited anymore.

04:20.245 --> 04:22.679
I can't say that I am.

04:22.681 --> 04:24.681
Nimah... hey.

04:24.683 --> 04:26.183
Hey.

04:26.185 --> 04:30.420
- Alex.
- Hey, D. How are you?

04:30.422 --> 04:31.454
- Good.
- You remember...

04:31.456 --> 04:34.090
Corporate goddess and
badass agent Shelby Wyatt?

04:34.092 --> 04:34.924
How could I forget?

04:34.926 --> 04:37.093
We're about to become old friends.

04:37.095 --> 04:40.681
So, what do you think happened?
Another terrorist event?

04:40.683 --> 04:43.065
Well, If Alex is here, there
can't be one far behind.

04:43.067 --> 04:45.935
- Funny.
- It's good to see you again, Alex.

04:45.937 --> 04:47.303
You, too.

04:47.305 --> 04:49.105
You changed your hair. It looks good.

04:49.107 --> 04:51.040
I didn't, but thanks.

04:57.817 --> 05:00.883
Good afternoon. Thank
you all for coming.

05:00.885 --> 05:03.886
We have a lot of ground to
cover in a short amount of time,

05:03.888 --> 05:04.887
so let's get started.

05:04.889 --> 05:06.155
Madam President?

05:06.157 --> 05:10.158
Terrorism is never spontaneous.

05:10.160 --> 05:12.728
Every act takes
planning and preparation.

05:12.730 --> 05:15.096
It take money to fund it,

05:15.098 --> 05:17.566
strategy to ensure it goes off properly,

05:17.568 --> 05:21.303
technology to be current,
arms for fear and control,

05:21.305 --> 05:24.105
the media to ensure
that most people see it,

05:24.107 --> 05:26.107
political parties who
gain influence from it,

05:26.109 --> 05:28.943
fundamentalists who take credit for it,

05:28.945 --> 05:33.081
and, finally, the power players
who benefit from it the most.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.616
When these eight pillars come together,

05:35.618 --> 05:39.820
they create a perfect storm,
which is what we saw on 9/11,

05:39.822 --> 05:42.189
in the Moscow theater
siege, at Bataclan,

05:42.191 --> 05:44.625
and, last month, at the G20 Summit.

05:44.627 --> 05:46.427
Whatever this shadow group was planning

05:46.429 --> 05:48.880
by stealing those
drives is still unknown.

05:48.882 --> 05:52.199
Luckily, only one
country's got out... ours.

05:52.201 --> 05:55.002
We call this information "the cache."

05:55.004 --> 05:58.154
Four years' worth of
intelligence about this country.

05:58.174 --> 06:01.608
Now, that cache was
accessed two days ago.

06:01.610 --> 06:04.044
Someone downloaded security
and maintenance patterns

06:04.046 --> 06:06.479
for domestic cargo flights.

06:06.481 --> 06:10.483
And at 4:00 a.m. this morning,
an RNX cargo aircraft went down

06:10.485 --> 06:12.485
just outside of Annville, Kentucky.

06:12.487 --> 06:14.887
You need to figure out
if these are connected,

06:14.889 --> 06:17.123
what it's a part of,
and who's responsible.

06:17.125 --> 06:18.291
But you're not looking for the person

06:18.293 --> 06:19.726
who sabotaged the plane.

06:19.728 --> 06:22.729
You need to find and
identify the collaborators...

06:22.731 --> 06:24.964
Who paid for it, who's behind it,

06:24.966 --> 06:27.233
who benefits from it, and why.

06:27.235 --> 06:31.070
What you're doing goes
beyond the FBI and the CIA.

06:31.072 --> 06:34.673
It's illegal and sanctioned only by me

06:34.675 --> 06:36.876
because we don't know how far this group

06:36.878 --> 06:39.245
has infiltrated our own government.

06:39.247 --> 06:42.015
I'm putting my Presidency on the line.

06:42.036 --> 06:44.250
My son, Clay, is in charge.

06:44.252 --> 06:46.418
As my top political
strategist, he knows how to see

06:46.420 --> 06:48.654
what's coming and how to plan for it.

06:48.656 --> 06:52.691
Listen to him. Learn from him.

06:54.058 --> 06:56.052
And, whatever you do, watch your backs.

06:56.054 --> 06:58.455
These people are not playing around.

07:06.397 --> 07:07.964
Hey. What's up?

07:07.966 --> 07:11.400
I'm sorry. I didn't
know who else to call.

07:11.402 --> 07:12.602
What's going on?

07:12.604 --> 07:13.903
Someone's trying to kill me.

07:13.905 --> 07:16.513
N-N-Not just me. All of us.

07:18.495 --> 07:22.862

07:24.041 --> 07:28.074
Home sweet home. Dayana,
if you don't mind,

07:28.076 --> 07:30.076
I would love to have my old roomie back.

07:31.547 --> 07:32.946
By all means.

07:32.948 --> 07:34.681
Upstairs. Back corner.

07:34.683 --> 07:38.418
Okay, so... I guess
it's just you and me.

07:38.420 --> 07:42.422
This isn't summer camp.
We don't need to share.

07:42.424 --> 07:43.423
Okay.

07:43.425 --> 07:46.459
Single's over here, Nimah.

07:46.461 --> 07:49.062
Hey, listen. Leon's gonna meet us later.

07:49.064 --> 07:50.729
Okay? Don't tell the others.

07:50.731 --> 07:53.299
Okay, so, I guess I'll just solo

07:53.301 --> 07:56.135
Harry and Sebastian's old room upstairs.

08:00.741 --> 08:02.541
So you kept in touch with Nimah?

08:02.543 --> 08:05.310
Well, I figured she could use a friend.

08:05.312 --> 08:07.145
She came over for
dinner a few nights ago.

08:07.147 --> 08:10.282
You cook in that tiny studio?

08:10.284 --> 08:12.952
It's a loft in Ballston now.

08:12.954 --> 08:14.553
You moved?

08:16.657 --> 08:18.056
I didn't know that.

08:18.058 --> 08:20.092
I didn't think you cared.

08:20.094 --> 08:24.096
I didn't. I mean I don't. I-I mean...

08:24.098 --> 08:26.664
Whatever you want.

08:26.666 --> 08:29.001
Whatever I want?

08:33.357 --> 08:34.905
Hey!

08:37.904 --> 08:41.412
You cannot seriously ignore
me. I mean, we're both adults.

08:41.414 --> 08:42.346
I'm not ignoring you.

08:42.347 --> 08:45.683
I'm simply disinterested
in communicating.

08:45.685 --> 08:48.686
Hey, look, I know it
might be a little weird,

08:48.688 --> 08:51.122
us both being here, but
your mother asked me to come.

08:51.124 --> 08:52.256
I did not volunteer.

08:52.258 --> 08:55.192
So if you could maybe just
be a little bit professional.

08:55.194 --> 08:56.827
Prof... Professional?

08:56.829 --> 08:58.062
Did you just say that?

08:58.064 --> 09:00.131
'Cause I'm pretty sure that
your definition of that and mine

09:00.133 --> 09:01.265
do not line up very well.

09:01.286 --> 09:03.863
Okay. All I'm asking
is a little courtesy.

09:03.884 --> 09:06.137
A smile, a handshake when I say hello.

09:06.139 --> 09:07.971
I've gotten far on the Hill

09:07.973 --> 09:11.174
because of my honesty,
directness, my humility.

09:11.176 --> 09:13.343
I can smile and shake
hands with people I dislike

09:13.345 --> 09:15.311
and disagree with on
a fundamental level.

09:15.313 --> 09:17.480
But they never mistake
that smile for approval,

09:17.482 --> 09:20.050
which, if we're being honest,
direct, and true to character,

09:20.052 --> 09:22.376
is what you're really seeking from me.

09:22.397 --> 09:25.564
I told my mother I would take
this job on one condition...

09:25.566 --> 09:27.966
That you were not a part of it.

09:27.968 --> 09:30.969
But since she needed your
help during the G20 crisis,

09:30.971 --> 09:32.571
she's afraid to let you
out of her sight now.

09:32.573 --> 09:34.206
That is why you're here.

09:34.208 --> 09:36.208
Not for any net gain
you bring this group

09:36.210 --> 09:37.576
of far better operatives than you.

09:37.578 --> 09:39.378
You're here because you know too much,

09:39.380 --> 09:41.746
and you must be babysat till it's over.

09:41.748 --> 09:46.551
So, sit, baby, wait, and
stay out of my way, okay?

09:55.429 --> 09:56.994
Welcome to the bunker.

09:56.996 --> 10:00.231
What you're working on is
beyond codeword-classified.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.265
It doesn't exist.

10:01.267 --> 10:03.267
Here, two stories underground,

10:03.269 --> 10:05.303
you should have the privacy you need.

10:05.305 --> 10:07.505
Can anybody tell me what this is?

10:07.507 --> 10:10.342
A canvas on which we can
paint our hopes and dreams?

10:10.344 --> 10:12.176
It's a smart board.

10:12.178 --> 10:16.180
It's a roster with each
position to be filled

10:16.182 --> 10:18.415
by the names and faces
of our collaborators.

10:18.417 --> 10:20.985
Each time information
from the cache is accessed,

10:20.987 --> 10:22.519
it gives us a unique opportunity

10:22.521 --> 10:24.848
to identify one or more of these faces.

10:24.869 --> 10:26.523
When we find every single one of them,

10:26.525 --> 10:28.625
we'll bring them down, once and for all.

10:28.627 --> 10:34.030
It begins by analyzing the
crash of RNX's cargo flight 284.

10:34.032 --> 10:36.266
Who benefited from this crash?

10:36.268 --> 10:38.201
That's where we start our investigation.

10:39.605 --> 10:41.805
Every conspiracy that
I've ever been around

10:41.807 --> 10:43.607
ultimately has the government behind it.

10:43.609 --> 10:47.443
So which party or
politician benefits the most

10:47.445 --> 10:50.192
from the fear and panic
caused by a plane crash?

10:50.213 --> 10:53.097
This was a cargo plane,
not a civilian airliner.

10:53.118 --> 10:55.518
No one's gonna panic over
some missing deliveries

10:55.520 --> 10:56.686
from Nordstrom Rack.

10:56.688 --> 10:58.788
Politicians aren't corrupt
just because they wield power.

10:58.790 --> 11:00.510
I don't think that
pillar's holding this up.

11:02.660 --> 11:05.495
The single biggest
beneficiary from terrorism,

11:05.497 --> 11:06.662
dollar for dollar?

11:06.664 --> 11:08.063
That would be the defense industry.

11:08.065 --> 11:10.232
You think defense companies see

11:10.234 --> 11:12.034
a huge increase in orders for weapons

11:12.036 --> 11:13.836
after a cargo plane crashes?

11:13.838 --> 11:16.406
Look, the type of government
contracts that occur

11:16.408 --> 11:18.007
after an act of terrorism
are not to be ignored.

11:18.009 --> 11:19.641
Alex, back me up here.

11:19.643 --> 11:21.510
Well, I don't think
that pillar holds up.

11:21.512 --> 11:23.879
Cute.

11:23.881 --> 11:25.680
If you can't reach consensus,

11:25.682 --> 11:27.778
how are you gonna convince my mother?

11:27.799 --> 11:31.086
A sentence I haven't
said since high school.

11:33.357 --> 11:35.724
Leon didn't sound like himself.

11:35.726 --> 11:37.058
He sounded desperate.

11:37.060 --> 11:39.360
As desperate as this?

11:42.499 --> 11:45.434
"I'm being hunted." What is this link?

11:45.436 --> 11:47.436
A recruit from The Farm
died in a car accident...

11:47.438 --> 11:48.303
Drunk driver.

11:48.305 --> 11:50.539
But Leon thought it was a conspiracy.

11:50.541 --> 11:53.107
He's been texting odd stuff
like that for days now.

11:53.109 --> 11:55.743
Look, I've been the
paranoid one no one believes.

11:55.745 --> 11:58.379
Let's set a time to meet.

11:58.381 --> 12:01.382
You want social control? That is media.

12:01.384 --> 12:03.551
From personal experience
as "America's most hated,"

12:03.553 --> 12:04.919
I know these are not people

12:04.921 --> 12:06.687
who care who they hurt for a story.

12:06.689 --> 12:08.249
I know the press has been cruel to you,

12:08.261 --> 12:09.563
but it's not the right path.

12:09.584 --> 12:11.291
Is that your role in this, Nimah,

12:11.293 --> 12:13.093
poking holes in everyone else's theories

12:13.095 --> 12:14.562
without pitching any of your own?

12:14.564 --> 12:16.564
Not having a solution
doesn't mean she's wrong.

12:16.585 --> 12:17.757
You still don't have it.

12:17.759 --> 12:19.614
Okay, Doogie Howser. We get it.

12:19.635 --> 12:20.768
You know my brother...
You're gonna have to find

12:20.770 --> 12:23.437
deeper cuts than that if
you want one I haven't heard.

12:23.439 --> 12:26.060
Jimmy Neutron? Wesley Crusher?

12:26.081 --> 12:28.266
Clay Jong-Un?

12:28.287 --> 12:30.810
Oh, no. They're bonding.

12:30.812 --> 12:33.613
This is an interesting theory.

12:33.615 --> 12:34.948
Why don't you bring it up?

12:36.694 --> 12:38.618
You guys, we've been at this for hours

12:38.620 --> 12:40.253
and still no answers.

12:40.255 --> 12:41.821
Well, Nimah has one.

12:41.823 --> 12:43.389
No, I don't.

12:43.391 --> 12:45.725
Guys, we can do this. Let's just focus.

12:45.727 --> 12:46.926
But we don't need a
cheerleader right now.

12:46.928 --> 12:50.064
- We need results.
- Really? A cheerleader?

12:50.085 --> 12:51.664
Is this how it's gonna work?

12:51.666 --> 12:53.600
Endless debate without any action?

12:53.602 --> 12:55.768
There are horrific plans
in motion as we speak,

12:55.770 --> 12:57.269
and we're doing nothing to stop them.

12:57.271 --> 13:01.240
Since you were so good at
stopping them last time.

13:01.261 --> 13:04.624
Well, I'm glad you're finding
time to get a jump-start

13:04.645 --> 13:06.845
on your mother's State of the Union.

13:06.847 --> 13:08.343
You must be way ahead of the game.

13:08.346 --> 13:10.016
You said you were
supplying me with a group

13:10.018 --> 13:11.750
of highly-trained professionals

13:11.752 --> 13:14.199
equipped to take down an
unfathomable conspiracy.

13:14.202 --> 13:16.354
Instead, I'm a hall
monitor in high school.

13:17.625 --> 13:18.991
It's day one.

13:18.993 --> 13:20.425
They're adults.

13:20.427 --> 13:21.793
Day one or day 100,

13:21.795 --> 13:23.384
they should be able to work together.

13:23.387 --> 13:26.464
They need more than a boss.
They need a... drill sergeant.

13:39.012 --> 13:42.447
It came to my attention
that you needed some help,

13:42.449 --> 13:46.418
so I called on an old friend
to offer his expertise.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.460
Follow the money.

13:56.462 --> 14:00.831
When that plane
crashed, people profited.

14:00.833 --> 14:03.668
That was Nimah's theory earlier.

14:03.670 --> 14:06.870
Airline stocks were
shorted in huge volumes

14:06.872 --> 14:07.771
on September 10th.

14:07.773 --> 14:10.640
And if you look at yesterday's index,

14:10.642 --> 14:12.809
the same thing happened with RNX.

14:12.811 --> 14:14.878
So how do we "follow the money"?

14:14.880 --> 14:18.082
The old-fashioned way...
Human intelligence.

14:18.084 --> 14:19.640
Two days ago,

14:19.643 --> 14:23.019
a hedge-fund manager named
Sean Gregory got sloppy

14:23.021 --> 14:24.654
and made a small fortune for his firm

14:24.656 --> 14:26.056
by short-selling RNX,

14:26.058 --> 14:28.424
the shipping company
whose plane went down.

14:28.426 --> 14:31.327
It has all the classic hallmarks
of inside-information trading.

14:31.329 --> 14:34.097
Only this time, those
insiders may be responsible

14:34.099 --> 14:36.766
for the very act of terror
from which they profited.

14:36.768 --> 14:38.867
So we go after Gregory.

14:38.869 --> 14:41.704
Gregory executed the short,
but we need to find out

14:41.706 --> 14:43.562
who gave him the
tip... The collaborator,

14:43.565 --> 14:45.608
which is going to require
you to do the one thing

14:45.610 --> 14:48.344
you haven't been able to
do yet... work as a team.

14:51.216 --> 14:52.448
And if we can't.

14:52.450 --> 14:56.518
Well, there's no endorsement
card at the end of this rainbow.

14:56.520 --> 14:58.520
If we're exposed, POTUS goes down,

14:58.522 --> 15:00.756
I go back to jail, and
you all come with me.

15:02.585 --> 15:06.762
So, who's ready for a
little "Mission: Impossible"?

15:11.448 --> 15:12.431
Our target,

15:12.434 --> 15:15.568
Gregory Investment Partners, or GIP.

15:15.571 --> 15:17.938
Our villain... Sean Gregory,

15:17.940 --> 15:22.376
the portfolio manager who made
$112 million for his clients

15:22.378 --> 15:25.418
off of shorting RNX
stock prior to the crash.

15:25.421 --> 15:27.254
One of his clients tipped him off.

15:27.257 --> 15:28.523
We're gonna find out which one.

15:28.525 --> 15:31.892
Three clients filed to cash
out immediately after the short.

15:31.894 --> 15:35.062
All three of them will
be at a GIP party tonight.

15:35.064 --> 15:37.377
You're gonna find them, work them,

15:37.380 --> 15:39.066
get their reasons for cashing out.

15:39.068 --> 15:41.703
Whoever lies is our man... or woman.

15:41.705 --> 15:44.291
So get changed. It's black tie.

15:46.100 --> 15:48.642
Dayana will stay on
site, providing support,

15:48.644 --> 15:51.278
while we do the rest.

15:51.280 --> 15:53.280
Shelby will be herself,

15:53.282 --> 15:57.151
an heiress searching
for investment options.

15:57.153 --> 15:59.419
I'll be on site as myself, as well,

15:59.421 --> 16:02.223
making sure nothing goes wrong.

16:02.225 --> 16:06.059
Alex and I will be posing
as private security,

16:06.061 --> 16:08.228
pitching Sean Gregory on
our company's services.

16:08.230 --> 16:10.263
Care to make an exchange?

16:13.268 --> 16:16.636
And Ryan will pose as
one of the fund's clients.

16:18.841 --> 16:19.939
You look good.

16:19.941 --> 16:22.842
That hasn't changed.

16:25.247 --> 16:26.946
Nothing's changed.

16:26.948 --> 16:28.380
It's all changed.

16:35.290 --> 16:37.357
I can't find an excuse not to come.

16:37.359 --> 16:40.092
- Well, I'm glad you are.
- Me too.

16:42.764 --> 16:45.163
One small problem.

16:45.165 --> 16:47.332
There's a closed guest
list, and I'm not on it.

16:47.334 --> 16:49.602
Yes, you are. You
just don't know it yet.

16:51.005 --> 16:53.338
Hey, where are the Navigators?

16:57.711 --> 16:59.393
Nice.

17:06.353 --> 17:08.720
- Thank you.
- I never knew that.

17:17.731 --> 17:20.531
Excuse me? Logan Martin?

17:20.534 --> 17:22.500
You work for Omaha Pension, right?

17:22.502 --> 17:24.903
So do I. I, um...

17:24.905 --> 17:27.338
I just started, and I would love

17:27.339 --> 17:29.407
to get the inside scoop on everyone.

17:29.409 --> 17:33.177
You want to grab a
drink at the hotel lobby

17:33.179 --> 17:34.745
where it's quiet?

17:37.984 --> 17:39.984
Shelby Wyatt standing by.

17:39.986 --> 17:43.220
Ms. Wyatt's assistant standing by.

17:46.425 --> 17:49.059
I'm not used to parties like this.

17:49.061 --> 17:52.062
Oh, a room full of people who
think they're the good guys,

17:52.064 --> 17:54.230
when, in actuality,
they're destroying America

17:54.232 --> 17:56.232
for their own gain?

17:56.234 --> 17:58.869
You fit in just fine.

18:03.275 --> 18:04.307
Dayana online.

18:04.309 --> 18:07.844
Logan Martin is taking a
nice propofol-assisted nap

18:07.846 --> 18:09.279
in the backseat.

18:09.281 --> 18:11.448
So, you're clear to go, Ryan.

18:11.450 --> 18:14.050
Jon Jeffries, Omaha Pension.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.618
Thank you, sir.

18:15.620 --> 18:18.053
Omaha Pension is now represented.

18:18.055 --> 18:20.964
Alex, Owen, you ready?

18:20.967 --> 18:23.626
Standing by.

18:23.628 --> 18:25.060
Thank you.

18:27.264 --> 18:29.632
You were in a cell just a day ago.

18:29.634 --> 18:31.303
This must be surreal for you.

18:31.306 --> 18:34.311
Not as surreal as
having you as my partner.

18:34.314 --> 18:36.905
But I don't expect you'll be
on the task force much longer.

18:36.907 --> 18:39.074
Sean Gregory's coming
in hot. Put a pin in it.

18:39.076 --> 18:41.441
- Mr. Gregory.
- Mr. Hall.

18:41.444 --> 18:43.278
Thank you for making the time.

18:43.280 --> 18:44.413
Ms. Parrish.

18:44.415 --> 18:47.081
Always wanted to meet the
woman who saved New York.

18:47.084 --> 18:48.637
How do you like our little party?

18:48.640 --> 18:51.452
Well, it's nice to see how
the other percent lives.

18:51.454 --> 18:53.822
Well, if you invest in my company,
you could see it more often.

18:53.824 --> 18:56.457
Well, we were hoping you'd invest in us.

18:56.459 --> 18:58.092
I already have a private security firm.

18:58.094 --> 19:00.495
Yeah, but do they have the FBI and CIA

19:00.497 --> 19:01.563
on their résumés?

19:01.565 --> 19:04.265
It'll take us just five
minutes on your systems

19:04.267 --> 19:06.467
to convince you that you need us.

19:08.714 --> 19:10.684
My office is just down the block.

19:10.686 --> 19:12.686
Happy to take a breather from this

19:12.688 --> 19:14.321
and watch you try and convince me.

19:14.323 --> 19:15.522
Good choice.

19:16.959 --> 19:17.958
Let's go.

19:19.962 --> 19:23.162
Shelby, Nimah, Ryan, any
eyes on the three clients?

19:23.164 --> 19:25.766
Remember, one of them
could be our collaborators.

19:25.768 --> 19:28.769
I've spotted someone. I'm moving in.

19:28.771 --> 19:30.970
Just spotted one, too. Moving in.

19:35.977 --> 19:38.344
- Emily Meyers?
- Do I know you?

19:38.346 --> 19:39.879
I'm a new investor with the firm.

19:39.881 --> 19:41.314
Sean told me to come find you.

19:41.316 --> 19:43.283
Now's not a good time.

19:43.285 --> 19:44.450
I'm Sasha Barinov.

19:44.452 --> 19:47.053
I'm covering this for
the Journal, Life & Arts.

19:47.055 --> 19:49.322
Can I get a photo of the two of you?

19:49.324 --> 19:51.324
I-It's for... It's for the Instagram,

19:51.326 --> 19:52.191
not for the paper.

19:52.193 --> 19:53.960
I don't have a photographer present.

19:53.962 --> 19:56.028
Maybe later.

19:56.030 --> 20:00.833
A new investor in a rented tux?
I would have walked away, too.

20:00.835 --> 20:03.302
This isn't rented.
I just... lost weight.

20:03.304 --> 20:06.305
Who are you talking to, Ryan?

20:06.306 --> 20:09.240
Sasha Barinov, from
the Journal, you said?

20:09.243 --> 20:12.411
Repeating my name.

20:12.413 --> 20:15.314
I read "The Seven Habits of
Highly Effective People," too.

20:15.316 --> 20:17.916
But you haven't said yours.

20:17.918 --> 20:19.918
Jon Jeffries, Omaha Pension.

20:19.920 --> 20:22.321
I heard you guys are
having a tough quarter.

20:22.323 --> 20:26.158
And which section are
you asking that for?

20:26.160 --> 20:27.359
Arts or Life?

20:27.361 --> 20:33.163
Unless you want to blow this
op, maybe turn off the charm?

20:33.165 --> 20:35.165
You fish, Sasha? I fish. I love it.

20:35.167 --> 20:36.873
I was down in Cabo a few years ago,

20:36.876 --> 20:38.735
I caught a roosterfish. The
thing was the size of a dog.

20:38.737 --> 20:40.737
I got some pictures of
it if you want to see?

20:40.739 --> 20:42.105
Uh, sure.

20:42.107 --> 20:44.341
Yeah, that'll work. Bore her to death.

20:45.611 --> 20:50.413
I know what you guys want...
and you have a good pitch.

20:50.415 --> 20:52.415
But I'm happy with my security.

20:52.417 --> 20:56.119
Oh, we are, too. It
was so easy to crack.

21:00.803 --> 21:03.204
This is our client list.

21:03.206 --> 21:06.148
And we didn't even use our best cracks.

21:06.151 --> 21:07.775
You're highly vulnerable, Sean.

21:07.777 --> 21:09.543
You need to delete this now.

21:09.545 --> 21:10.778
You can delete it yourself.

21:10.780 --> 21:11.979
We don't care about your clients.

21:11.981 --> 21:14.448
We just want to make you one of ours.

21:19.822 --> 21:23.223
I have to talk to the partners,
but if you get us a proposal,

21:23.225 --> 21:25.024
a follow-up is not out of the question.

21:25.026 --> 21:26.693
Sounds great.

21:26.695 --> 21:29.696
Now, why don't we go
and enjoy the party, hmm?

21:29.698 --> 21:32.199
Okay, so, why don't I
head over there with you

21:32.201 --> 21:34.568
while my colleague
whips up that proposal?

21:34.570 --> 21:36.736
Just don't like to let
a potential client go.

21:36.738 --> 21:39.171
You don't mind, Alex, do you?

21:39.173 --> 21:40.573
Sure. Of course.

21:40.575 --> 21:41.540
Sure.

21:46.247 --> 21:49.248
Just go easy on my firewall, would you?

21:49.250 --> 21:50.483
I got you, Sean.

21:55.990 --> 21:58.390
Owen and Alex got Sean's finger-scan.

21:58.392 --> 21:59.992
As soon as it gets to
you, log into their system

21:59.994 --> 22:01.527
and download their trade history.

22:01.529 --> 22:02.894
Already on it.

22:02.896 --> 22:05.491
Plan trade data coming in.

22:08.230 --> 22:10.169
Alex, I've put us on closed comms.

22:10.171 --> 22:13.571
I got an answer from Keyes
about the recruit Leon mentioned

22:13.573 --> 22:14.740
who died in the car crash.

22:14.742 --> 22:16.441
They didn't.

22:16.443 --> 22:19.611
Everyone from The Farm
is still very much alive,

22:19.613 --> 22:21.546
except Leigh, of course.

22:21.548 --> 22:25.517
Now, apparently, Leon has been
on Keyes' radar for a while now.

22:25.519 --> 22:28.853
Keyes thinks that what happened
to him at the G20 changed him

22:28.855 --> 22:30.455
and that he hasn't been the same.

22:30.457 --> 22:32.123
I'm worried.

22:32.125 --> 22:33.724
Me too.

22:33.726 --> 22:36.361
- So, are you a client?
- Potential client.

22:36.363 --> 22:39.063
Sean's wooing me. I'm
here via courtship.

22:39.065 --> 22:42.133
Shelby Wyatt. Like McGregor-Wyatt?

22:42.135 --> 22:43.368
That's right.

22:43.370 --> 22:44.735
I thought you were FBI.

22:44.737 --> 22:46.137
No, I am.

22:46.139 --> 22:48.139
Everyone in my family
couldn't get over an heiress

22:48.141 --> 22:51.542
- taking a government salary.
- Yeah.

22:51.544 --> 22:53.477
- What are you doing here?
- Well, um, I was...

22:53.479 --> 22:57.114
Is GIP under investigation?

22:57.116 --> 23:00.484
Changed my mind. I do feel like dancing.

23:00.486 --> 23:01.714
Excuse me.

23:10.262 --> 23:12.062
You've just helped me.

23:12.064 --> 23:14.731
I thought you would
want to see me go down.

23:14.733 --> 23:16.500
I don't want the mission to fail.

23:21.740 --> 23:23.807
You worked at the
Children's Defense Fund.

23:23.810 --> 23:26.668
You wrote for "The Daily Show."

23:26.671 --> 23:28.578
I mean, you may have
graduated from Quantico,

23:28.580 --> 23:30.974
but you quit three months
later to write speeches

23:30.977 --> 23:32.481
for Eric Garcetti.

23:32.483 --> 23:35.284
This type of thing is not for you.

23:35.286 --> 23:37.486
You want to shape the law, not break it.

23:39.062 --> 23:41.189
You read up on me?

23:41.192 --> 23:44.594
Your father used to talk about you.

23:44.596 --> 23:45.828
Oh.

23:48.866 --> 23:50.699
I think it's only
fair if in the morning,

23:50.701 --> 23:54.703
you respectfully decline
working on this team any further.

23:54.705 --> 23:57.372
You want me gone, I'm gone.

24:01.178 --> 24:02.978
Why would I withdraw?

24:02.980 --> 24:05.180
Being here is like printing money.

24:05.182 --> 24:07.382
Unless you want to
lose out, I'd go all in.

24:07.384 --> 24:08.983
Yeah, but I can't be the only client

24:08.985 --> 24:11.686
looking for the exit
after this week's windfall.

24:13.657 --> 24:15.657
Excuse me. I have to go.

24:17.561 --> 24:19.794
Emily on the move.

24:19.796 --> 24:22.297
She got a text to go up to GIP's office.

24:22.299 --> 24:24.465
Dayana cleared my mark. I can follow.

24:24.467 --> 24:25.848
She's my mark. I got it.

24:25.851 --> 24:29.003
It's not your mark if
she left you behind, Owen.

24:29.005 --> 24:31.005
Looks like ditching me at the office

24:31.007 --> 24:32.506
is about to pay off.

24:33.977 --> 24:38.179
I see Sean and Emily
meeting, moving closer.

24:48.491 --> 24:50.658
Alex. Shh.

25:03.556 --> 25:05.442
- Okay. We got to go.
- No, no, no, no.

25:05.445 --> 25:07.078
You tell me why you're
here or I'll flag security

25:07.080 --> 25:08.079
and bring an end

25:08.081 --> 25:10.615
to whatever it is you're
doing here definitively.

25:10.617 --> 25:13.017
Oh, if you had a cover to
be on this floor yourself,

25:13.019 --> 25:14.384
you would have done that already.

25:14.386 --> 25:15.786
Well, I'm here on company business.

25:15.788 --> 25:16.787
So am I.

25:16.789 --> 25:17.988
- Which one?
- Both of them.

25:17.990 --> 25:20.424
Okay, well, I will show you
mine if you show me Langley's.

25:20.427 --> 25:22.427
Funny, I've played that
game with you before.

25:22.428 --> 25:24.895
Whatever you show me, it'll
definitely not be yours.

25:24.897 --> 25:27.698
Stop me if short-selling stocks
based on terrorist activities

25:27.700 --> 25:29.233
rings any bells?

25:29.235 --> 25:32.502
I can neither confirm nor deny...

25:33.557 --> 25:35.357
Get up.

25:35.360 --> 25:37.733
We will accomplish
so much more together.

25:41.079 --> 25:43.447
Okay, hot. But is now really the time?

25:43.449 --> 25:44.581
I do have a hotel.

25:44.583 --> 25:46.082
Why do you keep talking?

25:49.921 --> 25:52.088
No, no, no, no, no! Less handsy!

25:52.090 --> 25:53.089
Okay.

25:53.091 --> 25:54.657
Kiss me.

25:54.659 --> 25:56.259
Oh!

25:56.261 --> 25:59.095
I am so embarrassed.
Please don't tell anyone.

25:59.097 --> 26:01.631
I'll definitely lose my job
if they find out about us.

26:01.633 --> 26:04.500
- And, as I'm a man, I probably wouldn't.
- Yes.

26:04.502 --> 26:07.999
Thank you so much.
This'll never happen again.

26:08.002 --> 26:09.985
Speak for yourself.

26:14.124 --> 26:17.759
Great idea... Two
operatives in plain sight.

26:17.762 --> 26:19.148
We should pose for pictures.

26:19.150 --> 26:21.598
Well, small talk's what
parties like this are for.

26:21.601 --> 26:23.577
You know what jeopardizes missions?

26:23.579 --> 26:25.813
Personal vendettas.

26:25.815 --> 26:28.015
- I have no beef with you.
- And Alex?

26:28.017 --> 26:29.416
Is that why you left her up there?

26:30.452 --> 26:34.721
Prison was my choice,
to protect my daughter.

26:34.723 --> 26:36.823
But Alex was the
reason I had to make it.

26:36.825 --> 26:39.559
But that doesn't make
her responsible for it.

26:42.645 --> 26:44.031
Sasha on your six.

26:46.068 --> 26:48.768
Oh, you brought a friend
for more fishing tips?

26:48.770 --> 26:50.570
No, I just caught something myself.

26:50.572 --> 26:54.173
Jon, this is Ilene
Landry, from Omaha Pension.

26:54.175 --> 26:55.575
That's where you work, right?

26:55.577 --> 26:56.409
Oh, Jon, I'm sorry.

26:56.411 --> 26:57.853
We were supposed to have that drink.

26:57.856 --> 27:00.179
We got to do that. I'm
gonna bring him back.

27:00.181 --> 27:02.181
Just a little drunk.

27:03.852 --> 27:07.853
That's odd.

27:08.889 --> 27:12.558
Um... I'm cross-referencing
GIP's clients' trades

27:12.560 --> 27:16.362
with other terror attacks, and
nothing is lining up at all.

27:16.364 --> 27:18.097
I need to get out now.

27:18.099 --> 27:20.933
With the proceeds we
reaped from the RNX crash,

27:20.935 --> 27:22.901
you can more than cover my withdrawal.

27:22.903 --> 27:25.704
This only works if the other
investors don't get spooked, Em.

27:25.706 --> 27:26.577
Pulling out now...

27:26.580 --> 27:28.707
Looks like one smart
investor capitalizing

27:28.709 --> 27:30.474
on a freak windfall.

27:30.476 --> 27:32.777
How did you ever think
to bet against RNX anyway?

27:32.779 --> 27:35.412
They pissed me off.

27:35.414 --> 27:37.582
They lost my mother's birthday present.

27:37.584 --> 27:40.985
So I decided to make a
run on their stock price.

27:40.987 --> 27:43.754
They're not funding the AIC.

27:43.756 --> 27:46.557
They're running a Ponzi scheme.

27:46.559 --> 27:48.559
I got to go.

27:50.296 --> 27:52.429
What are you doing up here?

27:52.431 --> 27:55.099
How did you get in? This
floor's restricted access.

27:55.101 --> 27:57.901
Emily Meyers, right?

28:00.172 --> 28:03.172
Um... Sean left me here
to finish up a proposal.

28:03.174 --> 28:05.089
You're still up here, Ms. Parrish?

28:06.011 --> 28:07.644
Mayday. Mayday.

28:07.646 --> 28:09.813
We need immediate help
getting out of the GIP.

28:09.815 --> 28:10.714
Harry?

28:10.716 --> 28:13.016
I'm close to the exit. I'll head over.

28:13.018 --> 28:15.952
But we'll be done for before
you even hit the pavement.

28:15.954 --> 28:19.122
Just a last-minute check to
finish up the proposal for you.

28:19.124 --> 28:21.690
Were you eavesdropping on us?

28:23.595 --> 28:26.996
Ah! There you are, been
looking all over for you.

28:26.998 --> 28:28.364
Oh, hello. Sebastian Chen.

28:28.366 --> 28:29.965
I'm Ms. Parrish and Mr. Hall's partner.

28:29.967 --> 28:32.835
They do data hacking.
I mine AV weaknesses.

28:32.837 --> 28:34.036
And right here, right now,

28:34.038 --> 28:36.471
your AV system is completely corrupted.

28:36.473 --> 28:38.544
We'll send you our proposal.

28:38.547 --> 28:40.214
- See you later.
- Get in the elevator,

28:40.217 --> 28:41.476
take it to the next floor down,

28:41.478 --> 28:43.045
take the stairs to the fire exit.

28:43.047 --> 28:44.880
They'll have security
waiting for you in the lobby.

28:44.882 --> 28:46.481
- What about you?
- I have my own route.

28:46.483 --> 28:48.117
It was nice seeing you, love.

28:54.760 --> 28:57.245
So you caught a criminal,
just not the right one.

28:57.248 --> 29:00.959
So, the cache led us in the right
direction, just to the wrong target.

29:00.961 --> 29:02.261
We'll do better next time.

29:02.263 --> 29:03.563
You're not getting a next time.

29:03.565 --> 29:06.299
That's it? It's one try, and it's over?

29:06.301 --> 29:09.302
You succeeded in proving you're
nothing but petty teenagers.

29:09.304 --> 29:10.570
Other than that, you failed.

29:10.572 --> 29:12.605
We just uncovered the
next Bernie Madoff.

29:12.607 --> 29:16.292
They're guilty of fraud,
money laundering, perjury,

29:16.295 --> 29:17.776
and theft, just to start.

29:17.778 --> 29:19.978
So he's not the link to the AIC,

29:19.980 --> 29:21.980
take the win, have him arrested.

29:21.982 --> 29:23.548
We can't do that.

29:23.550 --> 29:25.383
We don't want the real criminal
to know what we're doing.

29:25.385 --> 29:27.652
These people are real criminals.

29:28.723 --> 29:31.389
Okay, let's just treat this
like a textbook RICO case.

29:31.391 --> 29:34.392
- It seems easy enough.
- You were brought in to fix this, fix it.

29:34.394 --> 29:35.594
I can't.

29:35.597 --> 29:38.159
It was broken when you selected
these people for your team.

29:38.161 --> 29:40.498
You can't succeed with
traitors in your midst.

29:40.500 --> 29:42.767
And that's all I see.

29:42.770 --> 29:46.905
I'd rather go back to jail
than spend one more day here.

29:53.747 --> 29:56.480
If anyone should be leaving,
it should be him, no?

29:56.482 --> 29:58.816
He's right. I shouldn't be here.

29:58.818 --> 30:00.284
I shouldn't be here.

30:00.286 --> 30:01.619
No, you shouldn't.

30:04.079 --> 30:06.090
Clay hates me.

30:06.092 --> 30:07.922
Nothing's gonna change that.

30:09.362 --> 30:11.995
He doesn't hate you. He blames you.

30:11.997 --> 30:13.797
It's easier to blame someone.

30:13.799 --> 30:16.800
What's hard is to understand someone.

30:16.802 --> 30:19.370
To understand that we all live

30:19.372 --> 30:22.606
with the pain of what's happened to us.

30:22.608 --> 30:25.350
Clay blames you for what
happened to his father

30:25.353 --> 30:27.277
because it's easier
than living with the fact

30:27.279 --> 30:29.312
that he wasn't perfect.

30:29.314 --> 30:33.183
Clayton was my biggest mistake.

30:33.185 --> 30:36.019
Clay doesn't know that. He
thinks you're the mistake.

30:36.021 --> 30:39.455
And you? What about your mistake?

30:40.931 --> 30:44.026
Nimah, I love you. I do.

30:44.028 --> 30:45.194
And I don't love a lot of people,

30:45.196 --> 30:46.629
because I don't have a lot of people.

30:46.631 --> 30:48.964
I have Alex and you, and that is it.

30:48.966 --> 30:51.901
But what you did at the G20.

30:51.903 --> 30:54.537
I mean, how... How am
I supposed to love that?

30:54.539 --> 30:56.436
How can I even understand that?

31:01.545 --> 31:04.713
Because I am not my biggest mistake.

31:04.715 --> 31:06.748
Neither are you.

31:11.956 --> 31:13.388
Thank you.

31:14.891 --> 31:17.326
Um...

31:17.328 --> 31:19.961
Ooh. I figured you'd know where to go.

31:19.963 --> 31:22.364
Earl Grey. Whole milk.

31:22.366 --> 31:24.999
- Mm, sweet, you remembered.
- I did.

31:25.001 --> 31:27.311
I'd say it's on you, but your
credit cards are maxed out.

31:27.314 --> 31:28.136
I checked.

31:28.138 --> 31:30.171
I also checked some other things.

31:30.173 --> 31:32.907
You're no longer in
Her Majesty's service.

31:32.909 --> 31:36.010
Of course I am. What,
you think they'd tell you?

31:36.012 --> 31:38.146
I spoke to Charlotte Bishop.

31:38.148 --> 31:40.748
She said it happened
right after The Farm.

31:44.754 --> 31:46.754
Yeah.

31:46.756 --> 31:49.256
They threw me out after I
exposed their mission here.

31:49.258 --> 31:51.492
Well, now you have your
answers, Alex, so I'll...

31:51.494 --> 31:54.061
Harry... I know how you feel.

31:54.063 --> 31:56.096
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, I do.

31:56.098 --> 31:59.700
I was kicked out by the CIA and the FBI.

31:59.703 --> 32:01.670
The great Alex Parrish
has never been unmoored.

32:01.671 --> 32:03.036
You're a national hero.

32:03.038 --> 32:04.872
You'll always be wanted somewhere.

32:04.874 --> 32:07.875
Me, well, truth be told, MI6...

32:07.877 --> 32:09.409
didn't really want me.

32:09.411 --> 32:11.761
They just wanted to use
me as long as they needed.

32:11.764 --> 32:13.731
Even Charlotte couldn't
get me back in there.

32:13.734 --> 32:15.582
So I took a job.

32:15.584 --> 32:18.218
It was private security for Barclays.

32:18.220 --> 32:21.020
That's why I was at the
G20. Nothing glamorous.

32:21.022 --> 32:23.423
I was just polishing the
boots of some blowhard banker.

32:23.425 --> 32:26.426
And after we got through
that calamity in one piece,

32:26.428 --> 32:30.797
I thought MI6 would welcome
me back with open arms.

32:30.799 --> 32:33.900
You know, I'd saved
some lives, at least.

32:33.902 --> 32:36.903
Part of a team that tackled
the biggest hostage crisis

32:36.905 --> 32:38.104
the world had ever seen.

32:38.106 --> 32:42.909
But your country covered it
up, so what proof did I have?

32:42.911 --> 32:45.044
I was left with nothing,

32:45.046 --> 32:49.248
so I've been doing what
I can to prove my worth...

32:49.250 --> 32:51.717
on my own.

32:51.719 --> 32:54.286
Look, I know the information

32:54.288 --> 32:56.288
that Lydia has released
from those drives

32:56.290 --> 32:58.724
is being used for dangerous purposes.

32:58.726 --> 33:01.092
You were chasing that stock tip.

33:01.094 --> 33:02.260
So was I.

33:02.262 --> 33:04.062
And you figured that out on your own?

33:04.064 --> 33:06.164
It's a brilliant ploy, I must say.

33:06.166 --> 33:08.133
Profit off of terror.

33:08.135 --> 33:10.168
So, you know, any smarter,

33:10.170 --> 33:12.411
they'd be making money on
both sides of the trade.

33:14.908 --> 33:16.308
You're a good agent, Harry.

33:16.310 --> 33:17.375
You deserve back in.

33:17.377 --> 33:19.405
We could really use someone
like you on the team.

33:19.408 --> 33:21.446
Well, I'm not for hire, Alex.

33:21.448 --> 33:24.382
Everyone is. We both know that.

33:28.087 --> 33:29.854
What's this for?

33:29.856 --> 33:31.456
You said both sides of the trade, right?

33:31.458 --> 33:34.158
- So...?
- So...

33:34.160 --> 33:36.126
We know what happened the day before.

33:36.128 --> 33:37.528
What happened the day after?

33:40.132 --> 33:42.532
Fine, but I am submitting my receipt

33:42.534 --> 33:43.533
for the Acela to you.

33:43.535 --> 33:46.203
That bloody train cost
me an arm and a leg.

33:48.139 --> 33:51.407
Here we go.

33:54.484 --> 33:57.242
I've been fully briefed
and so has the President.

33:57.245 --> 34:01.147
She's rather disappointed.
I'm not entirely surprised.

34:01.149 --> 34:03.148
We try things all the time that fail.

34:03.150 --> 34:05.150
But the President's told me

34:05.152 --> 34:07.753
that it's Clay's decision to make.

34:10.424 --> 34:12.056
Any last words?

34:12.059 --> 34:13.091
ENGIN.

34:13.092 --> 34:15.594
I would have chosen
something a tad more poetic.

34:15.596 --> 34:17.029
What's ENGIN?

34:17.031 --> 34:19.531
The missing piece we
never thought to look for.

34:19.533 --> 34:22.734
When you look at all the trades
surrounding the RNX crash,

34:22.735 --> 34:23.835
there was one big one.

34:23.837 --> 34:27.072
Someone took a major
position in ENGIN Industries

34:27.074 --> 34:28.940
shortly after the crash.

34:28.942 --> 34:30.842
Why does this matter to us?

34:30.844 --> 34:33.078
Because ENGIN is an avionics start-up,

34:33.080 --> 34:34.513
and the cargo plane that crashed

34:34.514 --> 34:37.047
was carrying a prototype
of its new technology.

34:37.050 --> 34:39.216
Any loss of pressure, the
system automatically uses

34:39.217 --> 34:41.418
real-time information
to find a crash site

34:41.420 --> 34:43.888
where there'd be no
casualties on the the ground.

34:43.889 --> 34:45.518
It saved lives.

34:45.521 --> 34:47.608
The government just signed
a billion-dollar contract

34:47.610 --> 34:48.676
with them this morning.

34:49.885 --> 34:51.462
Meet Christian Kelly.

34:51.464 --> 34:54.098
Mr. Kelly is an independent investor,

34:54.100 --> 34:58.069
who just reaped a $200 million
windfall off of the crash.

34:58.071 --> 35:00.371
And he didn't do it using a hedge fund.

35:00.373 --> 35:04.375
He invested in ENGIN Industries
personally, four days ago.

35:04.377 --> 35:06.977
And a search into his
trade history indicates

35:06.979 --> 35:08.011
that this isn't the first time

35:08.013 --> 35:09.613
he's profited in the
wake of a terror attack.

35:09.615 --> 35:11.615
And all of that money is
in an off-shore account

35:11.617 --> 35:13.383
waiting to be used.

35:13.385 --> 35:15.385
We found our first collaborator...

35:15.387 --> 35:16.787
Christian Kelly.

35:16.789 --> 35:19.389
I'm actually impressed.

35:19.391 --> 35:21.157
How did you put this together?

35:21.159 --> 35:24.094
I had help. Harry Doyle.

35:24.096 --> 35:26.229
I think he would be
an asset to this team.

35:26.231 --> 35:28.231
No, after what he did last time,

35:28.233 --> 35:30.133
there's no way I'm gonna
let him back on the inside.

35:30.135 --> 35:32.335
So, what now? We take out Kelly?

35:32.337 --> 35:35.138
No. No, Kelly's just
one spoke in the wheel.

35:35.140 --> 35:37.140
You take him out now and the
others will scatter so far,

35:37.142 --> 35:38.441
you'll never find them.

35:38.443 --> 35:39.853
He's right.

35:39.856 --> 35:43.178
This is just the first
inning in a long game.

35:43.180 --> 35:44.981
We wait...

35:44.983 --> 35:48.317
until we have all the
faces on that board.

35:48.319 --> 35:51.754
I'm sorry... about what I said before.

35:51.756 --> 35:54.356
I was speaking out of anger,

35:54.358 --> 35:56.492
and I don't want to do that again.

35:56.494 --> 35:59.294
I want to do as much
good as I can to make up

35:59.296 --> 36:03.298
for all the bad my daughter did.

36:03.300 --> 36:04.933
If you'll have me.

36:04.935 --> 36:07.336
The game begins again tomorrow.

36:07.339 --> 36:11.207
Get some sleep. You'll
need it. All of you.

36:15.748 --> 36:17.779
You did change your hair.

36:20.783 --> 36:21.682
I did.

36:21.685 --> 36:23.551
I knew it! Why would you lie about that?

36:23.553 --> 36:26.054
I don't know. I just...

36:26.056 --> 36:28.056
I didn't like that you noticed,

36:28.058 --> 36:30.391
and, I mean, Shelby didn't even notice.

36:36.799 --> 36:39.733
You didn't call.

36:39.735 --> 36:41.335
You didn't either.

36:41.337 --> 36:44.038
I thought you didn't want to talk to me.

36:44.040 --> 36:46.207
What, because you gave me the ring back?

36:46.209 --> 36:48.241
Because I wanted more time...

36:48.243 --> 36:51.845
to figure out how to move forward.

36:51.847 --> 36:55.049
But here we are...

36:55.051 --> 36:56.884
pushed together again.

37:00.156 --> 37:02.723
There's just so much between us...

37:02.725 --> 37:04.658
so much weight.

37:04.660 --> 37:08.328
All of us have so
much weight between us.

37:09.831 --> 37:12.165
So, how are we supposed to move forward?

37:14.169 --> 37:16.369
We help each other carry it, I guess.

37:20.408 --> 37:22.541
I love you, Ryan.

37:22.543 --> 37:25.845
I know.

37:25.847 --> 37:29.015
I just need more time.

37:34.589 --> 37:38.524
Hey. I'm going on a
walk. You want to join me?

37:38.526 --> 37:41.293
Mm...

37:41.295 --> 37:44.463
I haven't seen this place before.

37:44.465 --> 37:46.064
They have a spa.

37:46.066 --> 37:48.100
I think that's a rumor.

37:48.102 --> 37:50.402
I say we look for it anyway.

37:52.406 --> 37:54.942
Sure. Let me just get my coat.

37:56.147 --> 37:58.309
Hello?

38:00.313 --> 38:02.313
Good evening.

38:02.315 --> 38:03.615
Mr. Haas.

38:03.617 --> 38:05.450
Catch up, okay?

38:05.452 --> 38:06.517
Mm-hmm.

38:11.991 --> 38:14.726
My fiancée says I'm too tough on you.

38:14.728 --> 38:16.927
Maxine Griffin.

38:16.929 --> 38:18.463
Founder of The Roster,

38:18.465 --> 38:20.632
a networking and visibility platform

38:20.634 --> 38:23.635
for professional women committed
to helping each other rise.

38:23.637 --> 38:25.403
My father tell you that, too?

38:25.405 --> 38:27.471
I'm a member.

38:29.475 --> 38:33.410
I'm sorry...

38:33.412 --> 38:35.345
that you have to deal with me,

38:35.347 --> 38:36.781
with any of it.

38:36.783 --> 38:39.483
I know what it's like
to lose a parent, and...

38:40.071 --> 38:41.036
I'm sorry.

38:41.039 --> 38:43.520
I should have just
stopped at "I'm sorry."

38:43.522 --> 38:46.122
Unlike most people in America,
I believe in freedom of speech.

38:46.124 --> 38:47.724
Keep going.

38:49.328 --> 38:52.296
I make mistakes.

38:52.298 --> 38:55.865
I make a lot of mistakes.

38:55.867 --> 38:59.502
But being an FBI agent
is not one of them.

38:59.504 --> 39:01.671
I do not make mistakes in my job.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.439
You can trust me.

39:03.441 --> 39:06.509
I will be professional.

39:06.511 --> 39:08.311
I will, too.

39:08.313 --> 39:10.680
Maxine wants to know

39:10.682 --> 39:13.482
if you want to come over
for dinner next week.

39:13.484 --> 39:14.884
That's a little weird.

39:15.886 --> 39:17.787
Sorry. Freedom of speech?

39:17.789 --> 39:20.189
I totally agree.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.391
So... if you don't mind,

39:22.393 --> 39:25.294
I will just tell her you're busy.

39:25.296 --> 39:27.129
That's perfect.

39:27.131 --> 39:28.731
Good night.

39:53.857 --> 39:55.523
Ryan Booth.

40:27.757 --> 40:29.089
Hey.

40:29.091 --> 40:30.391
You look into what I was talking about?

40:30.393 --> 40:32.359
We confirmed it at the highest level.

40:32.361 --> 40:34.428
Everyone in our class, except Leigh,

40:34.430 --> 40:36.029
is still very much alive.

40:36.031 --> 40:37.598
You talked to Keyes.
That's what you did.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.399
Why would you trust
someone on the inside?

40:39.401 --> 40:40.633
He's in on it.

40:43.972 --> 40:47.740
Leon, um... have you talked to someone?

40:47.742 --> 40:50.944
Like a shrink? I'm not crazy, Alex.

40:50.946 --> 40:54.381
No one is saying that you are, okay?

40:54.383 --> 40:58.918
Just maybe what happened
to us stayed with you.

40:58.920 --> 41:00.786
And we're just worried about you.

41:00.788 --> 41:02.942
Yeah, well, you should be
worried about me getting killed.

41:02.944 --> 41:03.776
We are.

41:03.779 --> 41:06.426
We're all burnt out, so we get it.

41:06.427 --> 41:08.794
The Company has people.
We could get you help.

41:08.796 --> 41:10.796
I asked for your help.

41:10.798 --> 41:13.998
You brought me nothing.
You believe their lies.

41:14.000 --> 41:16.601
- Leon.
- No, it's fine.

41:16.603 --> 41:18.803
You can't help me. I understand.

41:18.805 --> 41:20.972
I'm on my own.
