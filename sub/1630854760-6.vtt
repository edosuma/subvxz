WEBVTT

00:15.999 --> 00:18.470
- All rise.

00:20.274 --> 00:24.048
Court is now in session,
Judge Vogel presiding.

00:28.925 --> 00:30.294
- Appearances, please.

00:30.327 --> 00:33.099
- Erin Basile for the people.

00:36.072 --> 00:39.178
(in Navajo)

00:40.915 --> 00:42.686
- Okay, wait.

00:42.752 --> 00:43.955
Ms. Lowe?

00:44.322 --> 00:46.259
- Your Honor,
I'm introducing myself.

00:46.326 --> 00:48.698
- In this court,
you'll speak English.

00:50.200 --> 00:53.908
- Hello, my family
and my people.

00:54.008 --> 00:56.012
I am called Dezbaa Lowe.

00:56.079 --> 00:58.250
I am my mother's clan,
Big Water,

00:58.316 --> 01:00.454
and my father's clan,
Towering House.

01:00.487 --> 01:04.195
And in this way,
I am a Navajo woman.

01:04.262 --> 01:07.067
I am appearing on behalf
of the Defendants,

01:07.101 --> 01:08.303
Chase Etsitty,

01:08.336 --> 01:12.111
Shandiin Desmond
and Naataanii Desmond.

01:18.189 --> 01:20.962
(chanting): Shut it down!
Shut it down!

01:21.029 --> 01:23.801
Shut it down!
Shut it down!

01:23.868 --> 01:24.937
Shut it down!

01:25.003 --> 01:27.241
Shut it down!
Shut it down!

01:27.308 --> 01:29.980
Shut it down! Shut it down!

01:30.080 --> 01:32.552
Shut it down!
Shut it down!

01:32.585 --> 01:33.788
Shut it down!

01:33.821 --> 01:37.227
Shut it down!
(can hissing)

01:39.131 --> 01:41.670
- Cops, go home!

01:41.704 --> 01:43.841
- Naataanii.
Over there.

01:43.874 --> 01:46.614
That way.
(indistinct shouting)

01:47.481 --> 01:50.153
- Back up!
- Am I touching you?!

01:50.220 --> 01:52.224
- I said back up!

01:52.291 --> 01:54.763
- I said, am I touching you?!

01:56.399 --> 01:58.136
- Chase!

01:59.472 --> 02:00.742
- Shandiin.

02:00.808 --> 02:03.113
(Shandiin grunting)
Shandiin!

02:03.146 --> 02:04.783
Shandiin...
- Hey.

02:04.816 --> 02:06.520
- It's alright.
It's alright.

02:06.553 --> 02:09.058
Let me look at you.
Are you alright?

02:09.158 --> 02:10.394
- Yeah, yeah, you?
- I'm alright.

02:10.427 --> 02:13.133
- Chase!
- No, no, no.

02:14.536 --> 02:15.571
Chase.

02:15.638 --> 02:17.709
Get up. You alright?

02:17.776 --> 02:19.579
- Is that all you got, huh?

02:19.646 --> 02:21.583
- Hey, hey, stop.

02:24.956 --> 02:26.259
You're bleeding.

02:26.326 --> 02:28.430
- Yeah, me and half the people
here.

02:28.463 --> 02:31.102
(screams)

02:31.135 --> 02:32.906
- Get off of me, bro.

02:34.175 --> 02:35.978
They're the ones
who attacked us.

02:36.045 --> 02:39.720
- Maybe if you stepped back
like they asked,
it wouldn't have happened.

02:39.753 --> 02:43.661
We're trying to stop a uranium
mine from poisoning our people.

02:43.694 --> 02:46.900
Antagonizing the cops
won't help.

02:48.269 --> 02:50.608
- Did you see Derrick out there?

02:51.309 --> 02:53.781
- Nah, got separated.

02:54.983 --> 02:56.219
(sighs)

02:56.285 --> 02:58.624
(people coughing)

02:59.125 --> 03:02.264
Derrick?
(panting)

03:03.567 --> 03:05.938
(grunting)

03:08.076 --> 03:09.579
Are you okay?

03:09.646 --> 03:11.449
- Yeah, I'm fine.

03:12.084 --> 03:15.123
- When I didn't see you in here,
I was really hoping
you got away.

03:15.157 --> 03:18.798
- Yeah, well, it's hard to run
when they have you
in a chokehold.

03:18.831 --> 03:23.173
- You've only been back a week
and I already got you arrested.

03:23.239 --> 03:25.845
(panting)

03:32.191 --> 03:33.561
- Hey.

03:33.594 --> 03:36.299
So much for that peaceful
protest.

03:38.403 --> 03:40.240
(man): Hands off our land!

03:40.307 --> 03:42.111
Hands off our land!

03:42.177 --> 03:44.281
Hands off
our land!

03:44.315 --> 03:46.452
Hands off our land!

03:46.486 --> 03:48.423
Hands off
our land!

03:48.490 --> 03:50.360
Hands off our land!

03:50.427 --> 03:52.097
Hands off
our land!

03:52.131 --> 03:55.705
Hands off our land!
Hands off our land!

03:55.772 --> 03:58.276
Hands off our land!

03:59.746 --> 04:01.215
- Trespassing.

04:01.282 --> 04:02.685
Disorderly conduct.

04:02.752 --> 04:05.023
I'm grateful
it's just a misdemeanor.
- Grateful?

04:05.056 --> 04:08.430
They teargassed us, beat us,
and threw us in a dog kennel
for 12 hours.

04:08.496 --> 04:09.966
For nothing.
- It's light work.

04:10.200 --> 04:13.406
Quick catch and release.
C'mon, let's find a ride back
to the mine, get back at it.

04:13.440 --> 04:15.912
- Chill, Chase.
We just got out of jail.

04:15.978 --> 04:17.114
- So?

04:17.414 --> 04:22.491
- So, your way of doing things
is the reason
why we all got arrested.

04:22.525 --> 04:25.063
- Oh, my way?
What?

04:25.096 --> 04:28.436
You think our ancestors
walked around in circles
with poster boards?

04:28.504 --> 04:30.508
- No.
They were warriors, alright?

04:30.575 --> 04:33.146
They fought back
to protect our people.

04:33.179 --> 04:35.618
- So you're gonna fight?

04:36.385 --> 04:38.891
How exactly are you planning
on doing that?

04:38.924 --> 04:40.360
- I'm gonna do whatever it takes

04:40.528 --> 04:43.834
to make sure that nobody
has to watch their little sister
get sick like I had to.

04:43.901 --> 04:47.007
My father still won't admit
that it's the uranium
that made her sick.

04:47.074 --> 04:50.581
Alright. The uranium
that he's been blasting out of
the ground for 20 years.

04:50.615 --> 04:52.585
He still believes
the government's lies, man.

04:52.619 --> 04:54.990
- We're gonna expose those lies.

04:55.056 --> 04:57.327
- Yeah, you're gonna expose
the lies.
- You...

04:57.394 --> 04:59.465
Chase, you just need
to be patient.

04:59.498 --> 05:01.135
- I'm tired of being patient.

05:01.169 --> 05:03.306
While you're printing out
t-shirts, ad writing
your Facebooks

05:03.373 --> 05:05.310
and moonlighting
for tribal council,

05:05.343 --> 05:07.682
I'm gonna be riding
into battle.

05:08.617 --> 05:10.387
- Wait.

05:14.428 --> 05:16.967
There's another way.

05:18.604 --> 05:21.108
If the government won't do
the right thing,

05:21.175 --> 05:23.046
I may have a way
to shut down the mine.

05:23.046 --> 05:24.583
(laughing)

05:24.683 --> 05:26.787
- How?

05:28.189 --> 05:30.828
- I'll show you.

05:41.048 --> 05:44.221
That's where all the uranium ore
gets processed.

05:44.689 --> 05:48.731
If we shut this down,
the mine goes down with it.

05:51.469 --> 05:54.609
They built it
right after World War II.

05:54.676 --> 05:57.114
All the electrical systems,

05:57.180 --> 06:00.353
the cabling, controls,
they're junk.

06:00.387 --> 06:03.861
And they all converge
in one place,

06:03.928 --> 06:05.932
that building there.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.102
It's a single room,

06:08.269 --> 06:12.044
filled with all this old tech
that they don't even
make anymore.

06:12.679 --> 06:16.252
We bust that up,
the whole mill shuts down.

06:17.054 --> 06:19.659
You know, all that old equipment
it's irreplaceable.

06:19.726 --> 06:22.164
- And how do you know all this?

06:22.197 --> 06:25.437
- Yeah, a few years off the rez
and suddenly you're a genius?

06:25.470 --> 06:27.809
- My dad and my uncle
worked here.

06:27.842 --> 06:30.113
They hated it.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.954
Knew it was poisoning
the people.

06:34.623 --> 06:36.827
When I would play cards
with them as a kid,

06:36.893 --> 06:40.300
all they ever talked about
was how easy it was

06:40.367 --> 06:42.872
to take down
the whole thing.

06:44.408 --> 06:47.314
They planned it out,
every detail.

06:47.381 --> 06:49.653
Wrote it all down.

06:49.686 --> 06:52.190
Just never did anything
about it.

06:52.257 --> 06:53.794
- There's still security.

06:53.861 --> 06:55.030
- Not much.

06:55.096 --> 06:59.004
Especially not on the weekends,
when the mill doesn't operate.

06:59.906 --> 07:03.614
All we would need is a security
guard's key card to get us in.

07:04.315 --> 07:08.791
- You know, I see those
security guys at the bar like,
every Friday night.

07:09.793 --> 07:12.699
I work the door and they get
loaded on beers an whiskey,

07:12.732 --> 07:14.536
play pool.
Like clockwork.

07:15.070 --> 07:18.242
- We could do like prom night.
- Prom night?

07:18.844 --> 07:21.850
- Your little sister
never told you?

07:21.917 --> 07:24.956
She lifted some keys
off a group of guys.

07:25.023 --> 07:27.094
Took us for a cruise.

07:27.729 --> 07:29.298
- Shandiin, you stole a car?

07:29.365 --> 07:31.603
- Well, I borrowed it.

07:32.104 --> 07:36.012
But those security guards,
all buzzed up, gambling,

07:36.045 --> 07:37.849
they're easy targets.

07:37.882 --> 07:41.857
If I can take a car,
I can take a badge, no problem.

07:41.890 --> 07:44.061
- We're not busting up
a chemical mill.

07:44.128 --> 07:46.365
- Let me talk
to the tribal council first.

07:46.432 --> 07:48.236
- For what?
- Maybe they can file a lawsuit.

07:48.303 --> 07:50.473
They've sued the mine
once before.
- 20 years ago.

07:50.541 --> 07:51.677
It did nothing.

07:51.710 --> 07:56.352
- Well, maybe with the arrests,
it's worth another shot.

07:56.920 --> 08:01.062
- Yeah, well,
while you do that...

08:01.730 --> 08:05.470
- We'll check out the bar.
- I'm with them, bro.

08:09.913 --> 08:13.887
- Ms. Lowe, I got your motion
for change of venue.

08:13.954 --> 08:16.860
- I'm prepared to argue that
now.

08:16.893 --> 08:19.031
- No need.
I'm denying it.

08:19.131 --> 08:22.037
- Your Honor.
- Stop calling him "Your Honor."

08:22.872 --> 08:25.845
- All of the accused are members
of the Navajo Nation

08:25.878 --> 08:28.917
and the alleged crime took place
within its jurisdiction.

08:28.951 --> 08:31.957
- In cross jurisdiction
boundaries, Ms. Lowe.

08:31.990 --> 08:33.761
In addition to that,

08:33.827 --> 08:36.800
Major Crimes committed
on tribal lands

08:36.867 --> 08:39.672
are tried in federal court.
- Yes, I'm aware.

08:39.773 --> 08:43.046
- I still consider murder
a Major Crime.

08:43.046 --> 08:46.485
- Your Honor, we move for the
dismissal of the murder charges.

08:46.520 --> 08:48.389
And that is definitely denied.

08:48.456 --> 08:49.559
(dry laugh)

08:49.626 --> 08:52.130
Ms. Lowe.
- Yes?

08:52.197 --> 08:53.634
- Sit down.

09:00.681 --> 09:02.985
- This is all my fault.

09:03.954 --> 09:05.658
- Don't say that.

09:05.691 --> 09:07.695
- It's the truth.

09:09.131 --> 09:12.304
And I'm sorry.
I should have listened to you.

09:19.051 --> 09:21.590
(theme music)

09:35.584 --> 09:38.289
(laughter in the bar)

09:41.663 --> 09:43.934
- Excuse me.

09:46.606 --> 09:49.211
Sorry, I'm late.
- It's all good.

09:49.278 --> 09:52.050
Yeah, I just wanted a chance
to check things out over here.

09:52.117 --> 09:56.091
- You see anyone you like?
- Yeah.

09:57.060 --> 09:59.198
See Shrek over there
at the table?

09:59.264 --> 10:01.736
His access badge is clipped
on his jacket

10:01.837 --> 10:04.441
and his jacket's hanging
on the chair behind him.

10:04.475 --> 10:07.849
And he's about...
four gin and tonics in,

10:07.882 --> 10:09.886
plus he's trying
to run the table,

10:09.919 --> 10:11.857
so he's focused elsewhere.

10:11.890 --> 10:14.629
So same ol' same ol'?
You pass I shoot?

10:14.662 --> 10:17.033
Like old times.

10:17.535 --> 10:19.471
- Yeah, old times.

10:19.539 --> 10:23.881
Like when you took off to
college to be a basketball star

10:23.947 --> 10:26.452
and you didn't get a hold of me
for months?

10:26.485 --> 10:29.458
Or the times where you came
back to town for holidays

10:29.526 --> 10:32.164
and you didn't even bother
to stop by?

10:32.197 --> 10:35.136
What about that little
girlfriend you lied to me about?

10:35.203 --> 10:36.773
- Okay, I get it, alright.

10:36.840 --> 10:39.144
Um, you're not happy I'm back.

10:39.211 --> 10:42.117
- I haven't decided yet.

10:43.152 --> 10:45.356
Why did you come back?

10:45.991 --> 10:48.262
- I told you.

10:48.296 --> 10:49.699
- Yeah, I know what you told me.

10:49.833 --> 10:53.907
You read about my brother
and the mine and you said
you wanted to help.

10:53.941 --> 10:57.047
- My people needed me.
(She chuckles.)

10:57.080 --> 10:59.619
- Yeah, that's why you jumped
on a plane

10:59.686 --> 11:02.090
and left behind
your fabulous life in the city.

11:02.157 --> 11:05.296
After barely even talking
to anyone for five years.

11:05.931 --> 11:09.104
- And who said it's so fabulous?

11:10.073 --> 11:11.576
(man): Oh yeah!

11:11.610 --> 11:12.912
The cusp!

11:12.945 --> 11:16.285
The cusp of victory, my friends!
- Showtime.

11:19.191 --> 11:20.861
- I'll get it.

11:20.928 --> 11:23.867
This ball, in that pocket.

11:24.334 --> 11:27.307
- Ah, got a lot of confidence
to call a pocket.

11:27.642 --> 11:29.679
- Yeah.

11:30.681 --> 11:32.552
- Good luck.

11:32.652 --> 11:35.223
- Luck has nothin' to do
with it.

11:39.632 --> 11:40.968
Oh, yeah!

11:41.035 --> 11:44.609
Let it rain green, boys.
Let it rain green.

11:44.676 --> 11:46.312
- Nice shot.

11:46.412 --> 11:48.282
(men laughing)

11:48.750 --> 11:51.322
- Hey! Hey! Hey! Hold up.

11:52.558 --> 11:54.762
Darrell, right?

11:57.033 --> 11:59.338
- Uh, Derrick.
Do I know you?

11:59.371 --> 12:00.708
- Yeah.

12:00.741 --> 12:03.279
Coach Martin introduced us
at UNLV.

12:03.346 --> 12:05.049
Yeah, I watched you play.

12:05.116 --> 12:07.087
You dropped 20.
It was a big game.

12:07.153 --> 12:09.124
- Yeah. Right, right.
Yeah, I remember you now.

12:09.191 --> 12:11.128
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Well, it's good to see ya.

12:11.161 --> 12:14.001
- Yeah, you too.
Yeah, great. For sure.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.973
- So what are you, uh...
what are you up to?

12:17.040 --> 12:21.650
- Uh, look, we're actually late
for something so, um...

12:21.716 --> 12:24.121
- Oh yeah, no trouble.

12:24.187 --> 12:26.626
I don't want to hold you up,
just uh...

12:26.693 --> 12:28.864
funny seeing you here.

12:31.468 --> 12:33.707
Hey, give my best to coach!

12:33.740 --> 12:36.278
- Yeah, you got it.

12:39.051 --> 12:42.223
Um... who the hell was that?

12:42.257 --> 12:44.061
- I have no idea.

12:44.127 --> 12:47.500
- Oh, when I heard stop,
I thought we were done for sure.

12:47.935 --> 12:50.941
- My heart's beating so fast.

12:52.511 --> 12:54.916
Hey, uh, I'll meet you
back there.

12:54.949 --> 12:56.185
- You're not coming?

12:56.251 --> 12:59.391
- You didn't seem too sure
about me earlier.

12:59.458 --> 13:01.261
- I told you.

13:01.328 --> 13:02.999
I haven't decided.

13:03.032 --> 13:06.005
- I just have a few things
I need to take care of.

13:07.040 --> 13:10.213
- Right, there's always
the things.

13:10.246 --> 13:13.553
- I just mean that
I'm gonna come over later.

13:17.127 --> 13:19.264
Drive safe.

13:19.297 --> 13:21.435
(car starting)

13:27.648 --> 13:30.988
- Derrick, get in the car.

13:33.326 --> 13:35.430
(car beeping)

13:40.741 --> 13:43.847
- Bailiff, for the record.

13:45.083 --> 13:48.456
Defendant Etsitty, I hope
I'm pronouncing that right,

13:48.523 --> 13:51.495
Defendant Etsitty has returned
from our morning break

13:51.529 --> 13:54.869
wearing a T-shirt I find
disrespectful to the process.

13:54.936 --> 13:56.205
- Are you trying to get us
convicted?

13:56.405 --> 13:59.812
- As I've made it clear,
Navajo will not be spoken
in these chambers.

13:59.846 --> 14:01.549
We're in the process
of covering it.

14:01.616 --> 14:04.989
Are the people ready
to call your first witness?

14:05.056 --> 14:06.492
- We are Your Honor.

14:06.559 --> 14:10.567
- Bailiff, when you're done
there, please bring in the Jury.

14:10.601 --> 14:12.571
- Yes, Your Honor.

14:13.239 --> 14:15.143
- You like workin'
for the white man?

14:15.209 --> 14:18.950
- She's just doing her job.
She's not the enemy, Chase.

14:21.956 --> 14:25.029
- We're surrounded by traitors.

14:27.902 --> 14:30.406
- What are you doing?

14:31.810 --> 14:33.446
- You asked me for a meeting.

14:33.513 --> 14:38.422
- So you just show up in public,
with this stupid story?

14:38.489 --> 14:42.965
- Relax. Your little girlfriend
didn't suspect anything.

14:43.032 --> 14:45.537
- I can't do this anymore.

14:47.140 --> 14:49.712
That's why I needed
to talk to you.

14:50.581 --> 14:54.187
All you said is
I had to gather information.

14:54.254 --> 14:57.193
- I said that's how we start.

14:57.260 --> 15:00.099
- Yeah, you didn't say anything
about setting up my friends.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.938
You keep changing the rules
on me.

15:04.474 --> 15:06.011
- Okay.

15:06.044 --> 15:08.182
We'll call the whole thing off.

15:08.249 --> 15:11.890
Yeah, abandon all the hard work
we've done together.

15:12.490 --> 15:14.796
And I'll take you in
so you can start spending

15:14.796 --> 15:17.500
the 20-year sentence
I suspended for ya.

15:17.535 --> 15:20.273
(sighs)

15:21.543 --> 15:23.379
But before we do that, I...

15:23.446 --> 15:28.422
maybe I should remind you
about you crying like
a little baby.

15:28.456 --> 15:31.495
How you couldn't take
one more day of lockup,

15:31.563 --> 15:35.571
and "Oh, I'd do anything
to get out of there."

15:36.673 --> 15:38.510
You remember?

15:41.181 --> 15:42.183
- Yeah.

15:42.250 --> 15:44.121
- Good.

15:45.490 --> 15:49.331
'Cause for a moment there
it seemed like you forgot.

15:56.746 --> 15:58.082
- Uh...

15:58.149 --> 16:00.486
I'm not killing anyone.

16:00.554 --> 16:03.425
- I'm not asking you to.

16:03.960 --> 16:06.599
But I'm impressed
you went there.

16:07.233 --> 16:11.308
Nah, it's firearm enhancements
for sentencing.

16:11.341 --> 16:12.978
Alright?

16:13.045 --> 16:14.615
You don't have to use it.

16:14.682 --> 16:17.153
You just have to make sure
everybody else knows it's there.

16:17.220 --> 16:21.128
Now take it
and get the hell out of my car.

17:15.804 --> 17:17.775
(knocking)

17:19.144 --> 17:21.649
- Hey.
(clears throat)

17:21.716 --> 17:23.653
- It's late.

17:24.421 --> 17:27.761
I thought
maybe you weren't coming.

17:30.701 --> 17:35.176
- I really need to talk to you
about this plan.

17:36.646 --> 17:39.150
You can talk to all of us.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.070
- Where you been?

17:49.070 --> 17:50.339
- Just around.

17:50.406 --> 17:52.110
- We've been trying
to reach you.

17:52.176 --> 17:54.314
- Uh, my phone's off, sorry.

17:54.414 --> 17:57.721
What's going on?
- What do you think?

17:59.792 --> 18:02.096
- Thank you.

18:03.533 --> 18:06.906
- This plan to take down
the mill,

18:06.940 --> 18:08.843
is it real?

18:09.912 --> 18:11.950
'Cause you have to admit,

18:11.983 --> 18:14.454
it's a little... strange,

18:14.487 --> 18:18.697
you show up
and suddenly we're saboteurs.

18:24.107 --> 18:25.476
- It's just an idea,

18:25.510 --> 18:28.215
so if it doesn't happen,
it's fine by me.

18:28.248 --> 18:30.353
- It's not fine by me.

18:30.787 --> 18:34.094
I'll go to that mine by myself
if I have to.

18:34.127 --> 18:36.465
- Same here.

18:38.369 --> 18:40.674
And I told my brother
about the keycard, so...

18:40.741 --> 18:44.782
We can't keep letting this
happen to us.

18:53.165 --> 18:55.504
It's our home.

18:56.839 --> 19:01.481
And we gotta do what we can
to protect it, our people,
and each other.

19:02.083 --> 19:04.755
So let's go shut it down.

19:09.765 --> 19:11.903
- So what's the plan?

19:44.000 --> 19:45.771
(beeping)

19:53.052 --> 19:55.289
(nervous sigh)

19:58.062 --> 19:59.965
- It's this way.

20:03.807 --> 20:07.213
(employee): Oh, man,
this thing's broken again?

20:07.313 --> 20:09.952
- We gotta call maintenance.
Let's go.

20:11.723 --> 20:14.795
<i>- Could you introduce yourself</i>
<i>to the jury please?</i>

20:15.797 --> 20:17.266
- My name is Samuel Donner.

20:17.266 --> 20:20.674
I'm a security guard
at the Orange Rock Uranium Mill
on the Reservation.

20:20.741 --> 20:24.915
- And on the weekend
of October 14,
were you working there?

20:24.982 --> 20:28.255
- Yeah. There were five of us
on duty that day.

20:28.322 --> 20:29.558
- That doesn't sound like a lot.

20:29.658 --> 20:31.194
- They don't run the mill
on weekends,

20:31.261 --> 20:34.234
so there's just a few of us
there keeping an eye
on the place.

20:34.300 --> 20:36.672
- And on that day, October 14,

20:36.739 --> 20:39.310
did you see
the Defendants there?

20:40.079 --> 20:41.849
- Oh yeah.

20:42.651 --> 20:44.855
I saw them.

20:45.724 --> 20:48.730
In fact, I more than
just saw them.

20:57.380 --> 20:59.985
(Naataanii, softly): Go.

21:09.137 --> 21:11.341
Chase, the bag.

21:13.278 --> 21:15.517
- What's going on?
What are we doing?

21:15.584 --> 21:17.386
- I told my sister
to keep a lookout.

21:17.420 --> 21:19.525
- No, we should stay together.

21:19.558 --> 21:21.161
- We should keep moving.

21:21.228 --> 21:22.998
Go.

22:01.174 --> 22:03.045
(sighs)

22:05.784 --> 22:06.853
- Card.
- Card.

22:06.919 --> 22:09.324
- I got it.
(beeping)

22:11.261 --> 22:12.865
- Whoa.

22:12.898 --> 22:15.069
This is the mothership.

22:20.914 --> 22:25.624
- Alright, it says we're looking
for a blue box.

22:25.657 --> 22:27.159
Derrick!

22:27.226 --> 22:28.897
Hey, Derrick.

22:28.963 --> 22:33.773
- Uh, yeah, yeah.
Blue box, right here.

22:35.142 --> 22:38.482
That power box on top is
what we need to get into to.

22:38.550 --> 22:41.421
- Naataanii,
help me out with this?

22:42.490 --> 22:45.095
Move the thing.
- Yeah, I got it.

22:49.905 --> 22:52.945
(tires screeching)

23:08.342 --> 23:10.547
- Oh no!

23:30.119 --> 23:32.123
(line ringing)

23:34.995 --> 23:38.569
<i>Hey, it's Naataanii.</i>
<i>Sorry I missed your call.</i>

23:45.449 --> 23:47.554
(short laugh)

23:50.326 --> 23:52.196
- Let's go, man.

23:55.102 --> 23:58.275
There's a bunch of wires
in here. That's what
we're looking for, right?

23:58.342 --> 24:00.179
- According to this, yeah.

24:00.212 --> 24:01.616
- Oh God...

24:01.682 --> 24:03.720
which one do I cut?
Like all of 'em?

24:03.786 --> 24:06.391
- We're looking for
the yellow wires to cut.

24:06.424 --> 24:08.428
- Okay.
- Am I reading this right?

24:10.499 --> 24:12.470
Derrick, you good?

24:12.504 --> 24:14.508
- Derrick?

24:19.317 --> 24:21.321
- You okay?

24:21.889 --> 24:25.095
(knocking)
- Naataanii, open the door!

24:25.195 --> 24:26.966
Open the door!

24:27.734 --> 24:29.103
(panting)
The... the cops are here.

24:29.137 --> 24:31.942
- What?
- They're coming to the same
door that we came in through.

24:32.009 --> 24:33.813
- We have to get out. Now!
- Damn.

24:33.880 --> 24:35.550
- Come on, let's go.
- Which wires?

24:35.583 --> 24:37.554
- Chase! Now. C'mon.
- Let's go!

24:37.587 --> 24:40.459
Go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go.

24:41.394 --> 24:42.798
- Which way is out?

24:42.864 --> 24:45.102
- The opposite direction
from where we came.

24:48.743 --> 24:51.816
- The three of them
basically ran into you.

24:51.849 --> 24:54.087
- Yeah.
- And what did you do?

24:54.153 --> 24:55.890
- What we're trained to do.

24:55.924 --> 24:58.563
Summon backup
with this call button.

24:58.596 --> 25:03.639
- And were you aware
of a law enforcement action
in progress at the time?

25:03.706 --> 25:06.879
- No, ma'am.
No one had bothered to tell us.

25:06.912 --> 25:10.987
- Now when you're on duty,
are you issued a firearm?

25:12.423 --> 25:14.628
- They give us pepper spray.

25:14.695 --> 25:18.035
- Can you tell the jury
what happened next?

25:19.137 --> 25:20.005
(sighs)

25:20.272 --> 25:24.013
- Did you hear what I said?
What are you doing here?

25:24.648 --> 25:27.253
Yo! I said what
are you doing here?!

25:29.023 --> 25:31.595
(shouting in pain)

25:32.029 --> 25:33.533
- Get back!

25:34.601 --> 25:37.206
- Stop!
Stay where you are.

25:38.241 --> 25:40.613
(Donner groaning)

25:45.824 --> 25:47.627
- Derrick, what are you doing
with that?

25:47.661 --> 25:49.097
- Protection.
- Are you crazy?

25:49.130 --> 25:52.169
Did you know he had that?

26:03.659 --> 26:06.030
We're trapped.

26:18.956 --> 26:21.461
(indistinct radio communication)

26:21.494 --> 26:23.231
<i>- Go, go, go.</i>

26:26.037 --> 26:28.743
- You maced me.
- You're lucky I wasn't armed.

26:28.810 --> 26:32.316
- Shut up! You're lucky
I'm mostly nonviolent.

26:35.924 --> 26:38.963
- Hey, we need to talk just us.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.773
After we took that key card
at the bar,

26:43.840 --> 26:45.375
some guy stopped Derrick

26:45.610 --> 26:49.317
and talked to him about
seeing him play ball in college,
it's like they knew each other.

26:49.383 --> 26:51.956
But Derrick said he didn't know
who that guy was,

26:51.989 --> 26:56.131
but I just saw that same guy
outside wearing an FBI jacket.

26:57.901 --> 27:00.005
- You think Derrick set us up?

27:00.038 --> 27:02.944
- It's my fault, you warned us.

27:03.011 --> 27:05.249
I should have listened to you.
- Shh.

27:05.349 --> 27:07.086
- Be careful.

27:10.425 --> 27:13.064
- Hey, what the hell?
- The cops knew we were coming.

27:13.098 --> 27:14.835
- Yeah, 'cause we probably
tripped an alarm.

27:14.902 --> 27:17.674
- Because someone told them
we're coming.

27:21.014 --> 27:23.753
- Who was the guy at the bar,
Derrick?

27:24.588 --> 27:26.224
- What guy?

27:26.257 --> 27:28.830
- Stop lying to my sister.

27:29.698 --> 27:31.201
Give me your phone.

27:31.267 --> 27:33.539
- Are you serious?
- Give me your phone!

27:33.639 --> 27:34.641
- Are you serious right now?

27:34.708 --> 27:37.012
- I said give it to me.
- What is wrong with you?

27:37.046 --> 27:39.785
- I said give it to me, Derrick!

27:40.920 --> 27:43.693
- You know what? You're really
trippin' this time.

27:43.759 --> 27:46.264
- Don't you test me, Derrick.

27:50.974 --> 27:53.646
(grunting)

27:53.679 --> 27:55.282
- You're a dead man.

27:55.315 --> 27:58.021
- Aaah!
- You hear me?

27:58.088 --> 27:59.658
(Derrick grunts)

27:59.691 --> 28:01.060
- At that point,

28:01.094 --> 28:04.200
did Derrick admit he was working
with the police?

28:04.267 --> 28:06.237
- Not verbally. No.

28:06.304 --> 28:07.741
- So he didn't confess.

28:07.774 --> 28:11.949
- I think when he tried
to pull a runner, that was
confession enough.

28:11.982 --> 28:15.523
- Now while all of this is
happening, you're where?

28:15.990 --> 28:18.729
- On the floor.
With my hands tied.

28:18.763 --> 28:20.967
- And you could see
the defendants?

28:21.034 --> 28:24.140
- Yeah.
- And hear what they said?

28:24.775 --> 28:27.079
- I don't know
if I heard everything.

28:27.112 --> 28:29.885
But I definitely heard enough.

28:31.555 --> 28:33.325
(sighs)

28:34.761 --> 28:37.734
- Are you a cop?
- No.

28:37.801 --> 28:39.805
- Then why are you doing this?

28:39.838 --> 28:42.209
- He's an informant.

28:43.746 --> 28:46.017
A government puppet.

28:46.084 --> 28:48.889
I seen guys like you before.

28:52.964 --> 28:55.837
- Makes sense now
why you came back.

28:56.605 --> 28:59.477
Sure as hell wasn't
to help your people.

28:59.578 --> 29:00.813
- Shandiin.

29:00.880 --> 29:03.786
- You know betraying me,
that's...

29:03.853 --> 29:06.491
that's nothing new.

29:07.159 --> 29:08.963
But my brother?

29:09.030 --> 29:10.767
Chase?

29:11.602 --> 29:16.477
All the people that'll get
poisoned because of you...

29:17.614 --> 29:20.185
...who'll get sick and die.

29:21.956 --> 29:25.028
You know what your dad would do
if he were still alive, um?

29:25.062 --> 29:28.234
And he knew and see
what you'd done?

29:29.538 --> 29:31.074
He'd disown you.

29:31.140 --> 29:32.911
- You leave him out of this.

29:32.944 --> 29:35.082
- Or did the FBI give you that
too, huh?

29:35.148 --> 29:38.455
Fake memories of your dad
and your uncle

29:38.488 --> 29:40.459
plotting to take the mill down.

29:40.492 --> 29:43.064
How easy it would be,
if only they had the nerve?

29:43.131 --> 29:45.703
- Shut up!
Just shut up!
Shut up! Shut up!

29:45.737 --> 29:49.477
- Shut up! Everything you said
has been a lie.
(alarm ringing)

30:00.733 --> 30:03.271
(phone ringing)

30:11.354 --> 30:13.191
- Naataanii Desmond?

30:13.258 --> 30:14.327
<i>- Yeah.</i>

30:14.360 --> 30:16.632
- The only way out of there is
past us,

30:16.699 --> 30:20.305
which I know
you're not foolish enough
to think is a possibility.

30:20.339 --> 30:25.817
- We have hostages, including
your informant, Derrick.

30:25.850 --> 30:28.723
I swear we'll kill him.

30:29.624 --> 30:34.266
- I'll give you three minutes
to talk it over with
your friends before we come in.

30:49.130 --> 30:52.302
- His cover's blown.
- Yeah, I heard.

30:54.106 --> 30:57.079
Time's tickin' till we go in.

30:57.112 --> 30:59.951
- What if they kill your guy
first?

31:00.018 --> 31:03.224
- We can't use him anymore
anyway.

31:09.170 --> 31:11.942
- How much did they pay you?
- Nothing.

31:11.975 --> 31:14.213
- Is that what our lives
are worth to you?

31:14.280 --> 31:16.518
- You have no idea.
None of you do.

31:16.518 --> 31:20.893
Right, while all you sit here
all high and mighty,

31:20.960 --> 31:23.198
but I'm the only one

31:23.264 --> 31:26.170
who tried to make something of
myself out in the real world.

31:26.204 --> 31:28.274
- Is that what you call this?

31:28.308 --> 31:30.747
Making something of yourself?

31:30.813 --> 31:32.984
- No, you all stayed.

31:33.051 --> 31:35.188
Same house, same job.

31:35.222 --> 31:36.592
Didn't try to do
anything different.

31:36.658 --> 31:41.334
- And you think leaving is hard,
that's your excuse?

32:05.081 --> 32:07.319
It's buried here.

32:09.323 --> 32:12.964
We're the reason you have
a place to even come back to.

32:14.801 --> 32:17.106
And you set us up!

32:18.274 --> 32:20.112
You...

32:27.192 --> 32:28.996
- Yeah.

32:31.067 --> 32:34.541
I got in trouble in Vegas.

32:35.408 --> 32:39.150
Flunked outta school,
lost my scholarship...

32:41.220 --> 32:43.258
And I needed the money.

32:43.792 --> 32:47.967
This guy, he had a plan
and all I had to do was drive...

32:49.136 --> 32:52.577
And I ended up facing 20 years.

32:53.813 --> 32:56.952
So they offered me a deal.

32:59.123 --> 33:01.829
- So you sold us out
to save yourself.

33:01.895 --> 33:05.001
- I was in prison for three
months and I couldn't take it.

33:05.035 --> 33:07.472
I would have died in there.

33:08.943 --> 33:13.384
- And where do you think
we're all gonna go now?

33:14.386 --> 33:17.125
- I'm sorry, okay?
Please.

33:17.159 --> 33:19.163
- You have always been this way.

33:19.263 --> 33:22.002
Taking the easy way out,

33:22.035 --> 33:24.406
taking things
that weren't yours,

33:24.975 --> 33:29.450
using people
and then throwing them away
once you're done with them.

33:36.732 --> 33:38.669
- You're right.

33:41.608 --> 33:44.480
I forgot.
- Do it already.

33:48.254 --> 33:51.460
If you won't do it, I will.

34:00.813 --> 34:02.049
Naataanii!

34:02.115 --> 34:05.656
(panting)

34:08.127 --> 34:10.633
What are you doing?

34:11.300 --> 34:15.576
- Killing him would be
letting him off too easy.

34:22.924 --> 34:28.067
Your punishment is
to make things right.

34:30.940 --> 34:32.777
Old Way.

34:34.013 --> 34:36.685
You're going to face The People

34:37.787 --> 34:40.091
and you're gonna admit to them

34:40.158 --> 34:43.565
that you've caused all of this.

34:43.599 --> 34:48.207
You're gonna sit with everyone
you've harmed

34:48.241 --> 34:50.980
and you're gonna tell them

34:51.047 --> 34:56.925
how and why you betrayed them

34:57.794 --> 35:05.075
until they will decide
when to forgive you.

35:07.379 --> 35:11.555
That's how we're gonna
make things right.

35:28.522 --> 35:31.293
(Derrick crying)

35:43.585 --> 35:45.756
Let's go home.

35:51.601 --> 35:54.774
(sniffling)

35:56.310 --> 35:58.782
(louder): We're surrendering.

36:00.653 --> 36:03.191
- Nice and slow.

36:05.796 --> 36:07.399
- We're surrendering.

36:07.466 --> 36:10.105
- Hands where I can seem them.

36:10.138 --> 36:11.908
Hands up.

36:11.975 --> 36:13.779
Let me see those hands.

36:16.585 --> 36:17.653
- Alright.

36:17.687 --> 36:19.924
Alright, that's enough
right there.

36:21.060 --> 36:23.766
I said freeze.

36:23.832 --> 36:25.368
Cover us.

36:37.259 --> 36:39.129
Drop the weapon!

36:39.196 --> 36:41.000
(gunfire)

36:41.033 --> 36:43.271
- No!!
(agent): Down.

36:43.337 --> 36:46.645
Down on the ground!
- On the ground now!

36:48.147 --> 36:50.920
(Shandiin crying)

36:54.326 --> 36:56.130
- Suspect down!

36:56.197 --> 36:59.303
(crying)

37:01.373 --> 37:04.346
(Shandiin): You killed him!

37:04.346 --> 37:07.653
(shouting): You killed him!

37:11.695 --> 37:14.801
- When Derrick Nez came out of
the processing room,

37:14.868 --> 37:16.571
ostensibly to surrender,

37:16.638 --> 37:19.611
did you see him
carrying a weapon?

37:20.078 --> 37:21.748
- Yes.

37:22.784 --> 37:24.721
- That's a lie.

37:25.856 --> 37:29.129
- It's the same gun he used
to take me hostage.

37:29.196 --> 37:31.066
- And would you have seen
that gun

37:31.133 --> 37:35.408
if it had been left
behind by the defendants,
as they've claimed?

37:36.343 --> 37:38.414
- Absolutely.
- He's lying!

37:38.448 --> 37:40.251
- Counselor, control
your client.

37:40.285 --> 37:41.454
- That's a lie!

37:41.487 --> 37:42.990
The gun was right in the
middle of the floor.

37:43.057 --> 37:45.328
- Bailiff! Remove them all.
- It was right in front of him!

37:45.395 --> 37:48.735
- He's lying.
- He is. He's telling the
truth. We didn't do anything.

37:48.802 --> 37:53.211
- Say it was in front of you
or Derrick died for nothing.

37:53.244 --> 37:55.850
- Please.
We didn't do anything.

37:55.916 --> 37:59.323
You have to believe us.
We didn't do anything.

38:00.693 --> 38:03.765
We left the gun
so no one would get hurt!

38:11.882 --> 38:13.886
- I'd like a word with him.

38:13.952 --> 38:17.894
- I'll get his attorney.
- Ah, that won't be necessary.

38:19.429 --> 38:21.000
- It's the law.

38:21.033 --> 38:25.408
- We'll just be a second
and you'll be right outside.

38:33.057 --> 38:35.061
(beeping)

38:52.128 --> 38:57.439
Do you even understand what's
going to happen to you three?

38:57.840 --> 39:02.015
You took a guard hostage
at gunpoint.

39:02.650 --> 39:05.723
The judge out there
couldn't hate you more.

39:05.789 --> 39:07.727
And someone died.

39:07.793 --> 39:09.463
- Because of you.

39:09.496 --> 39:12.369
- Well, thanks to the felony
murder rule,

39:12.435 --> 39:15.041
that gets blamed on you.

39:15.809 --> 39:18.849
Doesn't matter if you didn't
pull the trigger.

39:19.483 --> 39:22.122
White man's justice.

39:24.426 --> 39:26.998
It's a bitch, right?

39:32.944 --> 39:35.883
You said you wanted to help
your people...

39:37.252 --> 39:43.097
Well, why don't you start
by helping your baby sister
and your loud mouth buddy?

39:45.335 --> 39:47.072
Because there is no one

39:47.138 --> 39:51.447
standing between any of you
and life without parole.

39:53.150 --> 39:56.490
No one but me.

39:57.994 --> 40:02.469
All you gotta do is
gather information.

40:04.072 --> 40:07.914
Let me know what you hear
from your uh... your
activist friends.

40:07.947 --> 40:11.253
- You want me to be a snitch
like Derrick.

40:11.287 --> 40:13.892
- Call it what you want.

40:14.827 --> 40:17.600
But it's the only way any of you
gets out of this mess.

40:17.667 --> 40:20.071
- How much did you pay him?

40:20.138 --> 40:20.906
- Derrick?

40:20.973 --> 40:22.777
- The security guard
on the stand.

40:22.810 --> 40:25.582
How much did you pay him
to lie about the gun?

40:30.726 --> 40:35.368
You think I had to pay someone
to throw over a worthless
piece of crap like Derrick?

40:35.435 --> 40:38.074
Or any one of you?

40:40.378 --> 40:42.984
He did it for nothing.

40:44.286 --> 40:46.524
I didn't even have to ask.

40:47.960 --> 40:51.835
So, do we have a deal?

40:55.041 --> 40:56.945
(spits)

41:06.831 --> 41:09.069
(beeping)

41:11.307 --> 41:13.477
He's all yours.

41:27.205 --> 41:29.911
<i>(Naataanii): The security guard</i>
<i>on the stand.</i>

41:29.944 --> 41:32.215
<i>How much did you pay him</i>
<i>to lie about the gun?</i>

41:32.315 --> 41:37.025

41:42.636 --> 41:45.241
<i>I didn't even have to ask.</i>

41:48.949 --> 41:50.986
<i>- Based on the bombshell</i>
<i>recording,</i>

41:51.053 --> 41:53.558
<i>the Justice Department is</i>
<i>investigating</i>
<i>the mining company's</i>

41:53.592 --> 41:57.365

41:57.432 --> 42:01.775
<i>whose efforts to shutter</i>

42:01.808 --> 42:04.413
<i>Pending a full environmental</i>

42:04.479 --> 42:08.522
<i>the Justice Department has</i>

42:08.588 --> 42:13.397
<i>Additionally, the Attorney</i>
<i>General has charged</i>
<i>an unnamed FBI agent</i>

42:13.464 --> 42:17.640
<i>with illegal coercion</i>
<i>of informants</i>
<i>against Indigenous groups.</i>

42:26.490 --> 42:29.731
- Hey.
- Oh, hey.

42:31.835 --> 42:35.174
- I'm sorry it had
to happen like this.

42:38.915 --> 42:42.055
- Maybe it's the only way
it could have happened.

42:43.825 --> 42:46.998
Derrick was in
so much pain before.

42:50.773 --> 42:53.077
But he's at peace now.

42:54.079 --> 42:57.787
I think he would've been happy
to have helped his people.
