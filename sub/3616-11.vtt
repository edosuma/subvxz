HEY.GUESS WHAT?

00:18.103 --> 00:19.296
YOU'VE COME
TO HELP ME
FOLD THE LAUNDRY.

00:19.396 --> 00:21.300
UH, NO.

00:21.401 --> 00:23.305
WHAT GOOD IS BEING
A WITCH IF I CAN'T
JUST TWITCH MY NOSE

00:23.405 --> 00:25.979
AND MAKE THE LAUNDRY
FOLD ITSELF?

00:26.079 --> 00:28.150
UH, WHICH WITCH
CAN DO THAT?

00:28.251 --> 00:30.004
SAMANTHA STEPHENS.

00:31.422 --> 00:31.967
FROM <i>BEWITCHED?</i>

00:34.681 --> 00:37.436
OH, IT'S ONLY, LIKE,
ONE OF MY FAVORITE
OLD TELEVISION SHOWS.

00:37.646 --> 00:41.763
YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES
I FORGET THAT YOU'VE
ONLY BEEN FULLY HUMAN

00:41.863 --> 00:44.351
FOR, LIKE, A MONTH.

00:44.451 --> 00:45.448
I'M BECOMING MORE HUMAN
BY THE DAY.

00:45.458 --> 00:47.150
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF...

00:47.250 --> 00:48.837
I BECAME REALLY HUMAN
AND...

00:49.923 --> 00:53.122
GOT A JOB?

00:53.222 --> 00:54.468
IF THAT'S THE CRITERIA
FOR BEING REALLY HUMAN,

00:54.478 --> 00:57.379
THEN I AM
IN BIG TROUBLE.

00:57.479 --> 00:59.635
WELL, I'M SERIOUS.

00:59.735 --> 01:01.097
PAIGE SAID THAT A LAWYER
AT LEGAL AID QUIT,

01:01.197 --> 01:03.311
SO SHE KINDA...

01:03.411 --> 01:05.230
RECOMMENDED ME.

01:05.331 --> 01:06.609
SHE DID?

01:06.710 --> 01:08.403
OF COURSE,
IF YOU DON'T THINK
I SHOULD, THEN I--

01:08.503 --> 01:10.827
NO, NO!

01:10.927 --> 01:12.247
UM,
ACTUALLY, I THINK
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

01:12.347 --> 01:15.503
IT WILL KEEP
YOU BUSY, AND...

01:15.603 --> 01:18.425
HELP YOU FIND
YOUR IDENTITY...

01:18.525 --> 01:20.765
WHILE I LOSE MINE.

01:20.865 --> 01:22.185
SORRY?

01:22.286 --> 01:23.062
NOTHING.

01:23.162 --> 01:24.438
TELL ME.

01:24.538 --> 01:25.859
IT'S JUST...

01:25.960 --> 01:28.447
BECOMING A WIFE.

01:28.547 --> 01:29.449
I MEAN,
I LIKE SAMANTHA,

01:29.549 --> 01:31.638
BUT I NEVER
ACTUALLY WANTED
TO BECOME HER.

01:33.393 --> 01:35.189
SEE, SAMANTHA...

01:36.566 --> 01:39.514
SHE WAS MARRIED
TO A HUMAN--

01:39.614 --> 01:41.475
DARRIN.

01:41.576 --> 01:42.783
DARRIN
COMPLETELY REPRESSED
SAMANTHA'S MAGIC,

01:42.793 --> 01:45.695
COMPLETELY DENIED
WHO SHE WAS,

01:45.795 --> 01:47.950
AND IT
WASN'T BECAUSE
HE DIDN'T LOVE HER,

01:48.050 --> 01:49.912
IT WAS JUST...

01:50.012 --> 01:51.498
THAT'S THE WAY
IT HAD TO BE.

01:51.599 --> 01:53.311
AND THIS WAS ONE
OF YOUR FAVORITE SHOWS?

01:54.815 --> 01:57.387
WELL, NOT THAT PART.

01:57.487 --> 01:59.515
IT'S JUST, GROWING UP
THAT WAS MY ONLY
ROLE MODEL

01:59.615 --> 02:02.940
FOR A TYPICAL MARRIAGE,

02:03.040 --> 02:05.320
SO THAT'S ALL I KNEW.

02:05.421 --> 02:06.530
AND HE WAS ABLE TO
MEET PEOPLE AND...

02:06.630 --> 02:09.705
LEAVE THE HOUSE
AND GO TO WORK AND
BUILD THIS CAREER,

02:09.805 --> 02:11.918
AND SHE
HAD TO STAY HOME,

02:12.018 --> 02:14.215
YOU KNOW, AND
COOK DINNER AND...

02:14.315 --> 02:17.347
DO THE LAUNDRY.

02:17.447 --> 02:19.185
SHE WENT
FROM BEING SAMANTHA

02:19.285 --> 02:20.645
TO BEING
MRS. DARRIN STEPHENS
OVERNIGHT.

02:20.745 --> 02:23.986
WELL, THAT
WON'T HAPPEN TO YOU.

02:24.086 --> 02:25.573
WON'T IT?

02:25.673 --> 02:26.575
NO.

02:26.675 --> 02:27.619
YOU'LL BECOME
MRS. COLE TURNER.

02:27.719 --> 02:29.164

02:32.397 --> 02:33.685

A DIFFERENT WORLD,
OBVIOUSLY.

02:33.695 --> 02:35.594

WE'RE HARDLY TYPICAL.

02:35.694 --> 02:38.184
I PROPOSED TO YOU
UNDER A HAIL OF DEMON GOO,

02:38.284 --> 02:40.356
AND YOU ACCEPTED WHILE
I WAS BLEEDING TO DEATH.

02:40.456 --> 02:42.945
REMEMBER?

02:43.045 --> 02:45.700
LOOK,
WHY DON'T WE JUST...

02:45.800 --> 02:49.183
DO IT AGAIN,
START OVER.

02:56.824 --> 02:57.768
WHERE DID YOU
GET THAT?

02:57.868 --> 02:59.646
FROM PIPER.

02:59.746 --> 03:00.648
SHE GAVE IT TO ME

03:00.748 --> 03:02.154
SO I COULD
GIVE IT TO YOU.

03:02.254 --> 03:04.199
WELL, THAT'S NOT
EXACTLY A GOOD OMEN.

03:04.299 --> 03:07.122
SHE WAS MARRIED
WITH THAT THING
6 TIMES.

03:07.223 --> 03:09.085
WELL, SHE MUST HAVE
LIKED SOMETHING ABOUT IT,

03:09.185 --> 03:11.006
OR SHE WOULD'VE
STOPPED AT, LIKE, 3.

03:11.106 --> 03:12.735
RIGHT?

03:13.777 --> 03:14.779

03:29.020 --> 03:30.423
WILL YOU BE MY WIFE?

03:30.523 --> 03:32.403

03:33.821 --> 03:36.436
YEAH.

03:36.537 --> 03:37.729
I WILL.

03:37.829 --> 03:38.900

WANT TO TALK.

04:05.934 --> 04:06.919
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.
I'M SORRY.

04:07.019 --> 04:08.797
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
JUST LET US IN.

04:08.897 --> 04:10.886

04:10.986 --> 04:12.682
I'LL DEAL WITH TYLER.

WHO'S LUDLOW?

04:14.911 --> 04:16.081
HE RUNS THE ACADEMY
WE TOLD YOU ABOUT.

04:18.043 --> 04:19.863
I'M NOT GOIN'
TO BOARDING SCHOOL.

04:19.964 --> 04:21.825
YOU CAN'T
SEND ME AWAY.

04:21.926 --> 04:23.163
OH, HONEY, IT'S
FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

04:23.264 --> 04:25.209
I TOLD YOU, I DIDN'T
MEAN TO DO IT.

04:25.309 --> 04:27.213
I SWEAR I'M NOT BAD.

04:27.313 --> 04:28.901
I SWEAR!

04:32.116 --> 04:36.500
Parents: WHAT'S GOING ON,
TYLER? I SMELL SMOKE.
IS THAT SMOKE I SMELL?

05:48.825 --> 05:52.023
THE SUN CAME UP AGAIN.

05:52.124 --> 05:54.028

VERY MUCH.

06:06.990 --> 06:08.057
I CAN'T STOP
LOOKING AT IT.

06:08.157 --> 06:10.105
I WAS LIKE THAT
WHEN I GOT MY BELLY RING.

06:10.205 --> 06:12.543

A WEDDING RING IS
TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

YEAH?

06:18.179 --> 06:19.250
WILL YOU PASS ME
THE MILK?

IT'S RIGHT
NEXT TO LEO.

06:21.354 --> 06:22.757

TO EACH OTHER.

06:22.858 --> 06:24.344

06:24.444 --> 06:26.725
WAIT, I DON'T UNDERTSAND.

06:26.825 --> 06:27.978
SHOULDN'T YOU WAIT
TILL AFTER YOU HAVE KIDS

06:28.078 --> 06:30.065
TO START FIGHTING
ABOUT THEM?

06:30.166 --> 06:31.569
WELL, WHAT'S THE MATTER?
MAYBE WE CAN HELP.

06:31.669 --> 06:34.049
IT'S ABOUT HAVING
A MAGICAL CHILD IN
A NON-MAGICAL WORLD.

06:36.220 --> 06:39.920
Piper: SOMEONE,
I WON'T SAY WHO,

06:40.020 --> 06:42.693
HAS THE INSANE NOTION
OF BINDING
OUR CHILD'S POWERS.

WHY IS IT INSANE?

YOUR POWERS WHEN
YOU WERE A CHILD.

06:49.959 --> 06:52.990

06:53.091 --> 06:56.246
IGNORANT
ABOUT OUR DESTINY.

06:56.347 --> 06:59.129

ON THOSE NORMAL DAYS,

06:59.229 --> 07:02.511
AND I FEEL LIKE
I WAS A COMPLETE
AND TOTAL FRAUD.

07:02.611 --> 07:06.184
YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT SAYING
HIDE THE TRUTH.

07:06.284 --> 07:08.900
IT'S JUST GROWING UP
IS HARD ENOUGH

07:09.000 --> 07:10.737
WITHOUT
THE EXTRA BURDEN
OF HAVING POWERS.

07:10.837 --> 07:12.992
MAGIC IS NOT A BURDEN.

07:13.092 --> 07:14.621
IT IS A GIFT.

07:14.721 --> 07:16.625
IT'S A LOT
FOR ANY CHILD
TO DEAL WITH,

GONNA BE MARRIED,

07:35.349 --> 07:37.604
AND HE'S GONNA HAVE
TO GET USED TO BRINGING
HOME THE BACON.

07:38.731 --> 07:40.987
SINCE WHEN DOES PHOEBE
CARE ABOUT BACON?

07:42.447 --> 07:44.937

WOULD YOU PLEASE
PASS ME THE MILK?

07:49.672 --> 07:51.383

SOME BREAKFAST?

07:58.859 --> 08:00.262
YOU KNOW, IT'S THE
MOST IMPORTANT MEAL
OF THE DAY.

08:00.362 --> 08:01.849
THANKS. I'LL
JUST GRAB COFFEE
ON THE WAY.

08:01.949 --> 08:03.602
ARE YOU SURE? I
COULD WHIP SOMETHING
UP IN A JIFF.

08:03.703 --> 08:06.315
IN A JIFF?
REALLY?

08:06.416 --> 08:07.779
COME ON, DUDE.
LET'S GET PAID.

08:07.879 --> 08:10.450

OK?
OK.

08:24.539 --> 08:25.793
WHATEVER
MAKES YOU HAPPY.

08:28.883 --> 08:32.724
I WONDER WHAT
I SHOULD MAKE HIM

08:39.155 --> 08:42.395
SO, THIS IS YOUR OFFICE.

08:42.495 --> 08:43.982

A CHAIR, A LAMP.
WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED?

08:44.082 --> 08:46.403
UH, OXYGEN?

AN ASSISTANT.

08:51.140 --> 08:53.629

ENERGY BALLS.

08:53.729 --> 08:55.215
YEAH, WELL,

I WISH I HAD TIME
TO GET TO KNOW YOU,
BUT I DON'T,

09:08.093 --> 09:09.872
SO JUMPING RIGHT IN
WOULD BE GOOD.

09:09.972 --> 09:11.376
I HAVE TO JUMP
RIGHT OUT.

09:11.477 --> 09:13.046
IF ANYONE NEEDS ME,
I'LL BE DOWN THE HALL.

09:13.146 --> 09:14.341
OK.

09:14.441 --> 09:15.343

HE'S DUE IN AT 12:00
FOR A FACT-FINDING SESSION,

09:20.287 --> 09:22.483
WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE
2 HOURS TO LEARN EVERYTHING
YOU CAN ABOUT THIS CASE,

09:22.583 --> 09:25.365
SO YOU BETTER BE FAST
AND YOU BETTER BE GOOD.

09:25.465 --> 09:27.828

09:45.968 --> 09:47.246
WHAT'S
WITH THE KID?

09:47.346 --> 09:48.539
OH. POLICE
BROUGHT HIM IN.

09:48.639 --> 09:49.751
FOUND HIM
SLEEPING IN AN ALLEY.

09:49.851 --> 09:51.046
IS HE A RUNAWAY?

09:51.146 --> 09:52.547
LOOKS LIKE IT.
HIS NAME'S TYLER,

09:52.648 --> 09:54.261
BUT I'M HAVING TROUBLE
GETTING MORE INFORMATION
OUT OF HIM.

09:54.361 --> 09:56.182
SOMETIMES THOSE
LITTLE VIDEO GAME THINGS
HELP LOOSEN THEM UP.

09:56.282 --> 09:59.563
UM, BILLY'S GOT ONE
IN THE BACK.
I'LL GO GET IT.

09:59.663 --> 10:01.318
GOOD.

10:01.419 --> 10:02.321
UH, HERE YOU GO,
TYLER.

10:02.421 --> 10:04.825
THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT BE THIRSTY.

10:04.925 --> 10:06.137
SO, HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT GIVING US
A PHONE NUMBER

10:07.849 --> 10:10.062
SO WE CAN CALL
YOUR PARENTS AND
LET THEM KNOW YOU'RE OK?

10:12.691 --> 10:16.326
DO YOU WANT THEM
TO KNOW YOU'RE OK?

10:17.702 --> 10:20.735
DID THEY HURT YOU?

10:20.835 --> 10:21.862
NO. THEY
DIDN'T HURT ME.

10:21.962 --> 10:23.616
GOOD. ALL RIGHT.

10:23.716 --> 10:25.246
UM, BUT
SOMETHING HAPPENED?

10:25.346 --> 10:27.375
I DON'T WANNA
TALK ABOUT IT.

10:27.476 --> 10:29.003
YOU KNOW, I KNOW
IT'S HARD, TYLER, BUT
TALKING IS HOW WE FIX--

10:29.103 --> 10:31.484
I SAID I DON'T
WANNA TALK ABOUT IT!

10:33.863 --> 10:34.281

10:57.790 --> 11:00.780
HEY.

11:00.880 --> 11:02.201
HEY, HEY. DON'T GO.

11:02.302 --> 11:03.245
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO BE AFRAID.

11:03.345 --> 11:04.414
IT'S OK.

11:04.514 --> 11:05.707
I WON'T TELL ANYONE
I SAW YOU START THE FIRE.

11:05.807 --> 11:08.715
YOU SAW?

11:08.815 --> 11:10.718
YEAH, BUT, UH,
NOBODY ELSE DID.

11:10.818 --> 11:13.724
AND I PROMISE
I WON'T TELL.

11:13.825 --> 11:15.729
I SWEAR I WON'T.

11:15.829 --> 11:17.733
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO DO IT.

11:17.833 --> 11:19.738

THAT, IN SOME WAYS,

13:28.118 --> 13:30.441

COULD MAKE SENSE FOR US
TO BIND HIS POWERS.

COULD JUST TAKE OFF
ONE OF HIS LEGS

20:56.431 --> 20:59.964
Tyler: WHAT'S THE SOURCE?

21:00.064 --> 21:01.300
A REALLY, REALLY BAD GUY.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.221
WHICH MEANS
HE'S PROBABLY RESURFACING

21:03.321 --> 21:05.141
IF THE BOUNTY HUNTERS
ARE AFTER TYLER.

21:05.242 --> 21:06.854
[SIGHS]

21:06.954 --> 21:08.901
SO LUDLOW MUST BE
A BOUNTY HUNTER, TOO, THEN.

21:09.001 --> 21:11.028
WHO IS LUDLOW?

21:11.128 --> 21:12.742
SOME GUY WHO RUNS
SOME SORT OF AN ACADEMY.

21:12.842 --> 21:15.540
MY DEMON PARENTS
WERE GONNA SEND ME THERE.

21:15.640 --> 21:18.187
TO TRAIN.
TO SERVE THE SOURCE.

21:20.902 --> 21:24.057
SO THEN I AM BAD.

21:24.157 --> 21:27.023
WHY DO YOU SAY THAT?

21:27.123 --> 21:28.161
WELL, IF I'M SUPPOSED
TO USE MY POWERS

21:28.171 --> 21:30.030
TO PROTECT SOMEBODY BAD--

21:30.130 --> 21:31.533
NO, BUT THAT'S
NOT HOW POWERS WORK.

21:31.633 --> 21:33.830
THEY'RE NOT GOOD OR BAD
BY THEMSELVES.

21:33.930 --> 21:37.086
IT'S HOW WE USE THEM.

21:37.186 --> 21:40.636
TYLER, WHY DON'T YOU
READ A LITTLE MORE
WHILE I TALK TO PIPER?

21:40.736 --> 21:43.785
ALL RIGHT.

21:45.998 --> 21:49.322
SEE? WITH A LITTLE GUIDANCE,

21:49.422 --> 21:51.242
HE'S ALREADY ON THE ROAD
TO ACCEPTANCE AND CONTROL.

21:51.342 --> 21:54.458
THAT'S GREAT,

21:54.558 --> 21:55.794
BUT I THINK
WE HAVE ANOTHER PROBLEM.

21:55.894 --> 21:57.757
I FIGURED OUT
HOW THE BOUNTY HUNTERS
FOUND OUT WHERE TYLER IS.

21:57.857 --> 22:00.346
THEY TRACKED HIS POWERS.

22:00.446 --> 22:01.574
YOU MEAN WHEN HE
BLEW UP THE CHAIR?

22:03.326 --> 22:04.605
YEAH.

22:04.705 --> 22:05.733
SO WHEN
HE VANQUISHED THEM--

22:05.833 --> 22:07.502
SO THERE MAY BE OTHER
BOUNTY HUNTERS ON THE WAY.

22:10.426 --> 22:11.846

âª I GUESS
THAT'S MY NEW ROLE âª

[SNARLING]

22:46.336 --> 22:49.453
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

22:49.553 --> 22:50.998
YEAH. NO MESSY CLEANUP.

22:51.099 --> 22:53.712
SINCE WHEN DO YOU SCREAM
INSTEAD OF FIGHT?

22:53.813 --> 22:57.070
ACTUALLY, I DID CONSIDER
SCRATCHING HIM.

22:58.322 --> 23:01.813
OK, THAT WAS
ANOTHER BOUNTY HUNTER,

23:01.913 --> 23:03.273
WHICH MEANS MORE ARE
JUST GONNA KEEP COMING

23:03.373 --> 23:05.238
UNTIL LUDLOW GETS TYLER.

23:05.338 --> 23:07.492
UNLESS
WE GET LUDLOW FIRST.

23:11.391 --> 23:13.214
LEO AND I CAN POSE
AS BOUNTY HUNTERS

23:13.314 --> 23:14.967
AND SAY
THAT WE HAVE TYLER.

23:15.067 --> 23:16.303
WE CAN GAIN
ACCESS TO LUDLOW
AND VANQUISH HIM.

23:16.403 --> 23:19.309
SURE. JUST AS LONG
AS YOU'RE HOME FOR DINNER.

23:19.409 --> 23:21.689
BUT HE'S GOTTA
BE PRETTY POWERFUL,

23:21.790 --> 23:24.696

WE MIGHT NEED
THE POWER OF THREE,

23:24.796 --> 23:27.286
SO BRING LUDLOW
BACK HERE JUST IN CASE.

23:27.386 --> 23:29.330

FOR THOSE TENANTS TODAY.

24:22.630 --> 24:23.549
THIS IS NOT THE WAY
WE DO THINGS AROUND HERE.

24:26.555 --> 24:27.834

PLAY THOSE GAMES?

KIND OF VIOLENT?

24:48.563 --> 24:52.263
LOOKS LIKE HE'S LEARNING
TO HANDLE HIS POWER.

24:52.363 --> 24:55.353
HE WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN GIVEN THEM
IF HE COULDN'T.

24:55.453 --> 24:58.625
IS THAT WHAT YOU THINK
ABOUT YOU AND YOUR SISTERS?

24:58.919 --> 25:00.798
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE.

25:02.426 --> 25:06.017
ALL I DO KNOW IS
THAT WHEN WE FINALLY
GOT OUR POWERS BACK,

SCRAMBLING TO CATCH UP,

BUT THINK

25:12.656 --> 25:14.479
IF WE HAD HAD
OUR POWERS FROM DAY ONE,

25:14.579 --> 25:16.441
WE WOULD HAVE BEEN
MORE PREPARED.

STILL BE ALIVE?

WOULD BE DEAD.

WOULD BE ON OUR WAY
TO HAVING TO A FAMILY

25:26.312 --> 25:28.383
AS OPPOSED TO
JUST TALKING ABOUT IT.

25:28.483 --> 25:30.472

HAVE TIME FOR THIS.

HOW YOU DO IT.

26:32.999 --> 26:34.735
BUT TO LURE LUDLOW
BACK HERE.

26:34.835 --> 26:36.591
OH! BISCUITS ARE READY!

26:36.839 --> 26:39.430
WE'LL NEED
SOME PROOF FOR LUDLOW

THAT WE
ACTUALLY HAVE TYLER.

OUT BEFORE, DIDN'T I?

YOU CAN'T FIND THE PLACE

27:28.913 --> 27:30.609
UNLESS YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR IT.

27:30.709 --> 27:32.320

27:42.985 --> 27:45.557
THEY DON'T KNOW
I'M A FIRESTARTER YET.

27:45.658 --> 27:47.813
ONCE THEY DO,
THEY'LL TAKE US
RIGHT TO LUDLOW.

27:47.914 --> 27:50.443
ISN'T THAT
WHAT WE WANT?

27:50.543 --> 27:52.042
NO! NOT AT YOUR EXPENSE,
AND I'M NOT GONNA
LET YOU GO IN THERE.

27:52.052 --> 27:54.910
AND I DON'T WANT TO SPEND
THE REST OF MY LIFE

27:55.010 --> 27:56.581
WITH BAD GUYS CHASING ME.

27:56.682 --> 27:57.916
HE'S RIGHT.
WHEREVER WE TAKE HIM,

27:58.017 --> 27:59.672
THEY'LL
EVENTUALLY FIND HIM.

27:59.772 --> 28:01.049
YEAH, BUT IF SOMETHING
HAPPENS TO HIM--

28:01.149 --> 28:02.928
THEY WON'T HURT ME.

28:03.029 --> 28:04.306
REMEMBER?

28:04.407 --> 28:05.768
I'M COVETED.

28:05.869 --> 28:07.439
IF HE TAGS ALONG,
IT MIGHT DOUBLE YOUR CHANCES

28:07.539 --> 28:09.359
OF GETTING LUDLOW
AND NOT HAVING TO GO HOME.

28:09.460 --> 28:11.406
I'D LIKE TO DO
SOMETHING GOOD FOR ONCE.

28:11.506 --> 28:14.328
ALL RIGHT,
BUT YOU STAY NEXT TO ME,

28:14.428 --> 28:17.837
AND IF ANYTHING
GOES WRONG,

28:17.937 --> 28:19.339
WE ARE OUT OF THERE.

28:19.439 --> 28:21.177
OK.

28:21.277 --> 28:22.823
THIS BETTER WORK.

28:35.767 --> 28:37.312
I'M NOT A KID.
I'M A FIRESTARTER.

28:37.856 --> 28:41.262
SO YOU GONNA
LET US IN OR NOT?

28:41.362 --> 28:42.474
WHAT'S THE PASSWORD?

28:42.574 --> 28:45.019

28:45.119 --> 28:46.064
IT'S, UH...

29:02.533 --> 29:05.817
OH, HI, HONEY.

29:05.917 --> 29:07.821
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THIS IS NO TIME
TO BE TAKING A BATH.

29:07.921 --> 29:11.370
PIPER MIGHT BE HOME
ANY MINUTE,

29:11.470 --> 29:12.915
AND SHE'S COUNTING ON YOU
TO WRITE A SPELL.

29:13.015 --> 29:14.083
OH, I TRIED,

29:14.183 --> 29:15.336
AND I ONLY GOT
AS FAR AS, "HEY, DEMON!"

29:15.437 --> 29:18.068
AND THEN
MY MIND WENT BLANK.

29:19.738 --> 29:20.824
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO YOU.

29:23.496 --> 29:25.233
IT MIGHT BE
SOME BACKFIRED SPELL
OR CURSE OR SOMETHING,

29:25.333 --> 29:28.574
BUT YOU GOTTA
SNAP OUT OF IT.

29:28.674 --> 29:30.369
THERE'S
WORK TO BE DONE!

29:30.469 --> 29:31.623
YEAH. HEY, WHY AREN'T YOU
AT THE OFFICE?

29:31.723 --> 29:34.127
BECAUSE I QUIT MY JOB.

29:34.228 --> 29:36.925
I DON'T THINK I'M CUT OUT
FOR THAT WHOLE 9 TO 5 LIFE.

29:37.026 --> 29:38.889

WHAT WILL YOU DO?

29:38.989 --> 29:41.142

I'M STILL SEARCHING
FOR WHO I AM.

29:43.373 --> 29:46.614
WHO NEVER LETS
HER SISTERS DOWN,

29:46.714 --> 29:48.257
SO GET OUT OF THAT BATHTUB
AND SHOW ME WHAT YOU'RE MADE OF!

29:50.013 --> 29:53.168
BETTER?

29:53.268 --> 29:54.265
HEY, COLE, HOW'S
YOUR PROGRESS GOING ON--

29:54.275 --> 29:56.174
OH, GOD!
FULL-FRONTAL PHOEBE. SORRY.

29:56.275 --> 29:59.181

SHE JUST FLASHED.

29:59.281 --> 30:01.185
YEAH, I GOT THAT.

30:01.286 --> 30:02.523
NO, NO, I MEAN,
SHE JUST FLASHED
BLACK AND WHITE.

30:02.624 --> 30:04.586
AGAIN? SHE'S
LIKE AN OLD TV THAT'S
ON THE BLINK OR SOMETHING.

30:04.836 --> 30:08.285
HEY, MAYBE
THAT'S THE CONNECTION.

30:08.385 --> 30:10.205
THE TV SHOW <i>BEWITCHED--</i>

30:10.305 --> 30:11.668
IS THAT
IN BLACK AND WHITE
OR COLOR?

41:31.793 --> 41:33.239
SITTING AND KNITTING
IS NOT THE WOMAN YOU ARE,

41:33.339 --> 41:35.243
JUST LIKE SITTING AND TYPING
IS NOT THE MAN I AM.

41:35.344 --> 41:37.806
NO. I CAN'T PICTURE YOU
DOING THAT.

41:39.144 --> 41:40.271
BUT CAN YOU
PICTURE US TOGETHER,

41:42.817 --> 41:44.191
OR ARE YOU SO FREAKED OUT
BY MARRIAGE THAT YOU DON'T--

41:44.201 --> 41:45.700
NO. I WANT TO MARRY YOU.

41:46.242 --> 41:49.732
WE JUST HAVE
TO WORK EXTRA HARD

41:49.832 --> 41:51.629
TO MAKE SURE
NEITHER ONE OF US
LOSES OUR IDENTITY.

41:52.799 --> 41:54.843
AND AS FOR GRAMS AND
HER NOTION OF MARRIAGE--

41:57.016 --> 42:00.273
OH, NO.

42:01.526 --> 42:04.474
WE CAN WATCH THAT
GO DOWN THE DRAIN.

42:04.574 --> 42:06.646
HMM.

42:06.746 --> 42:07.831
OOH!
