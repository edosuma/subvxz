WEBVTT

00:11.078 --> 00:13.047
What would you give
to have me back?

00:13.047 --> 00:14.115
Everything.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.182
<i>Who is she?</i>

00:15.182 --> 00:16.450
<i>Your challenge.</i>

00:16.450 --> 00:17.718
Jacqueline de Montrachet.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.420
<i>If you could seduce her,</i>

00:19.420 --> 00:21.589
<i>and there must be proof--
a letter</i>

00:21.589 --> 00:22.723
from her to you.

00:22.723 --> 00:24.625
- Your late husband's son...
- Prévan.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.427
<i>Pascal Valmont.</i>

00:26.427 --> 00:28.662
<i>That man
has no place in my family.</i>

00:28.662 --> 00:31.298
He is disinherited
and penniless.

00:31.298 --> 00:33.634
It's Camille.
She always wore it.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.302
See that no one touches her.

00:35.302 --> 00:37.438
If you are in need
of comfort, I--

00:37.438 --> 00:39.774
Bring me the letter
my wife intended for me.

00:39.774 --> 00:43.110
Have you forgotten
your reputation is in my hands?

00:43.110 --> 00:45.446
Why do you not simply
cast her out?

00:45.446 --> 00:46.781
<i>Far better that she leave</i>

00:46.781 --> 00:48.416
<i>because she cannot bear
to stay.</i>

00:48.416 --> 00:50.584
I need to see the letter
Madame wrote.

00:50.584 --> 00:54.088
Ariadne!
She is saying, "Forgive me."

00:54.088 --> 00:55.556
- Be silent!
- <i>Victoire!</i>

00:56.657 --> 00:58.058
Victoire.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.193
I must forgive.

00:59.193 --> 01:00.294
To find the light.

01:00.294 --> 01:02.329
<i>Otherwise, the darkness here</i>

01:02.329 --> 01:04.198
<i>will overtake you.</i>

01:08.202 --> 01:10.838
Even God does not forgive.

01:26.520 --> 01:29.423
<i>I've been asked
to recommend a girl</i>

01:29.423 --> 01:31.292
<i>from this orphanage,</i>

01:31.292 --> 01:34.728
<i>someone who can hold up
her head in a great house,</i>

01:34.728 --> 01:37.865
<i>someone who can serve
a fine couple.</i>

01:44.805 --> 01:47.308
I am Madame de Montrachet...

01:49.643 --> 01:51.679
...but I'll be a mother to you.

01:54.682 --> 01:57.485
<i>What were you thinking?</i>

01:57.485 --> 01:59.453
Call it an act of charity.

01:59.453 --> 02:00.855
As we speak,

02:00.855 --> 02:02.523
beggars all over the city

02:02.523 --> 02:04.892
are crying out
to be drenched in blood.

02:05.125 --> 02:07.228
Didn't I drive her
into your arms?

02:07.228 --> 02:08.496
And from them, into her home,

02:08.496 --> 02:10.698
from which
she is yet to emerge.

02:10.698 --> 02:12.633
You almost seem
concerned for her.

02:12.633 --> 02:14.268
She means nothing
to me, Camille.

02:14.268 --> 02:15.469
What is she to you?

02:15.469 --> 02:16.871
One moment,
you beg me to seduce her.

02:16.871 --> 02:18.272
The next, the very sight of her

02:18.272 --> 02:20.241
leads you to act
like a madwoman.

02:21.842 --> 02:23.744
<i>She's a friend of yours,
perhaps?</i>

02:23.744 --> 02:27.414
Nobody ever talks
about what the Baptists did.

02:27.414 --> 02:30.150
I hear Salome
was avenging her mother.

02:32.419 --> 02:33.654
Fail at the task I have set,

02:33.654 --> 02:35.689
you will never see
your letters again.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.858
Do not bring your recklessness
to my letters.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.661
There are rules to this.

02:42.162 --> 02:44.899
If I cannot understand you,
I cannot help you.

02:46.534 --> 02:48.769
Why do you hate
Madame de Montrachet?

02:48.769 --> 02:50.738
You do not need
to understand, Valmont.

02:50.738 --> 02:53.340
You simply need to do
as I ask you to.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.842
Then I'll put it another way.

02:54.842 --> 02:57.645
If I cannot understand you,
I cannot trust you.

02:57.645 --> 02:59.380
I am done with this.

02:59.380 --> 03:01.415
- You would not walk away.
- Why?

03:01.415 --> 03:04.552
Because you crave the return
of your beloved letters.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.288
Valmont.

03:08.455 --> 03:09.623
Valmont!

04:24.598 --> 04:27.501
Why so angry, Pascal?

04:30.904 --> 04:32.840
Is it money...

04:34.341 --> 04:35.476
...or women?

04:43.484 --> 04:45.386
A woman.

04:45.386 --> 04:46.887
<i>But which--</i>

04:46.887 --> 04:48.689
<i>the one you lost</i>

04:48.689 --> 04:49.890
or the one you seek?

05:38.672 --> 05:40.974
Ah. Bravo.

05:40.974 --> 05:42.576
I'd like to try
the last refrain one more time.

05:42.576 --> 05:45.512
Oh, my darling,
we really must be on our way.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.347
<i>A happy day. A happy day.</i>

05:47.347 --> 05:48.982
Here is to many more.

05:48.982 --> 05:50.084
It's refreshing to find a woman

05:50.084 --> 05:53.053
incapable of anything
but happiness.

05:56.123 --> 05:57.858
I will see you again soon.

06:05.899 --> 06:07.835
Camille.

06:07.835 --> 06:10.871
I was so disappointed
you weren't here.

06:10.871 --> 06:13.607
I do look forward to spending
some more time with you soon.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.442
And tell me,
has your maid recovered?

06:15.442 --> 06:17.411
I thought so much about her.

06:17.411 --> 06:18.612
<i>She's much better.</i>

06:18.612 --> 06:20.380
Thank you.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.916
Time to go. We mustn't be late.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.118
Lovely to see you.

06:24.118 --> 06:25.719
Goodbye.

06:25.719 --> 06:26.954
The game's over.

06:26.954 --> 06:29.389
Change is coming here.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.593
Good day, Marquis.

06:53.480 --> 06:54.548
Leave it.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.461
I hear there's to be a talk

07:07.461 --> 07:09.530
at the Foreign Mission Society tomorrow.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.832
And you'd like me to go?

07:11.832 --> 07:15.536
Perhaps you enjoy me being
attacked in the street, Henri.

07:15.536 --> 07:18.572
What happened was an
indiscriminate act of violence.

07:18.572 --> 07:21.675
There's a growing resentment
in the poor towards our kind.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.043
And what kind are we?

07:23.043 --> 07:24.945
Their betters,

07:24.945 --> 07:26.980
and we must behave
as such, my love.

07:29.516 --> 07:32.186
You haven't called me that
in such a long time.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.789
Then I am at fault.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.761
It was not her.

07:40.761 --> 07:41.862
- It was her.
- It was not.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.897
I saw her!

07:43.897 --> 07:45.866
I saw the hate in her eyes.

07:48.235 --> 07:50.137
It was the servant girl.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.239
She's dead, a ghost,
nothing more.

07:52.472 --> 07:55.943
Jacqueline, I cannot lose you
again to this madness,

07:55.943 --> 07:57.744
so I beg you,
put this behind you

07:57.744 --> 07:59.046
and go back to the world.

08:04.017 --> 08:06.019
<i>You're expected at the talk.</i>

08:07.154 --> 08:09.223
You have a duty.

08:18.832 --> 08:22.135
A hit to Valmont.

08:28.075 --> 08:29.776
A hit again.

08:33.580 --> 08:35.182
Oh!

08:35.182 --> 08:37.951
Vicomte de Valmont wins!

08:37.951 --> 08:40.754
Valmont! Valmont! Valmont!

08:40.754 --> 08:42.689
Congratulations, Prévan.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.897
You were so brilliant, darling!

08:49.897 --> 08:52.799
A son any mother
would be proud of.

08:53.901 --> 08:55.602
- Bravo, Valmont!
- Congratulations.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.808
<i>Bravo, Valmont!</i>

09:05.078 --> 09:06.914
My condolences.

09:06.914 --> 09:09.249
<i>Back in Paris
only a few short days,</i>

09:09.249 --> 09:12.085
<i>and already
he's the toast of the town.</i>

09:12.085 --> 09:13.253
In a few weeks,

09:13.253 --> 09:15.722
he'll be locked up
in his barracks again.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.090
With any luck,
there'll be a war

09:17.090 --> 09:19.826
and a cannonball
will tear off his head.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.262
Come now, Azolan.

09:23.597 --> 09:25.565
I need you
to take a letter to Camille.

09:38.645 --> 09:40.113
Sir, may I first of all say

09:40.113 --> 09:41.882
what an honor it is
to serve under you?

09:41.882 --> 09:43.984
By asking--

09:46.653 --> 09:48.121
Uh, by asking to see me today,

09:48.121 --> 09:51.358
I hope that means my work is
making a difference to Paris...

09:55.128 --> 09:57.030
...and ultimately the king.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.967
I have not called you in
to praise you.

10:01.335 --> 10:04.271
I have reports on you,
Gabriel Carré,

10:04.271 --> 10:07.708
that you are spending time
on a personal matter.

10:07.708 --> 10:09.810
Sir, that is not the case.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.645
It is an investigation,

10:11.645 --> 10:14.848
although the woman lost
was of great importance to me.

10:14.848 --> 10:17.184
I heard she was a whore
fished out of the river,

10:17.184 --> 10:20.721
one of the many who cannot bear
their miserable lives on Earth

10:20.721 --> 10:22.723
and take their chances
in the next life.

10:23.991 --> 10:26.059
Get back
to the real work, Carré,

10:26.059 --> 10:28.261
not suicides
of the dispossessed.

10:34.368 --> 10:38.772
I will not have
a disobedient man here.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.909
You understand?

10:54.287 --> 10:56.690
- My head...
- Mm.

10:56.690 --> 10:58.392
...is it in one piece?

10:58.392 --> 11:00.360
It has grown a friend,

11:00.360 --> 11:02.429
and I have to tell you...

11:02.662 --> 11:04.831
the friend is even prettier.

11:08.969 --> 11:10.704
<i>I thought I was free of it,</i>

11:10.704 --> 11:12.139
the falling sickness.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.842
What happened after I fell?

11:15.842 --> 11:17.744
Nothing of consequence.

11:19.846 --> 11:22.015
Now broth.

11:39.232 --> 11:41.001
You have something
to put to me?

11:42.202 --> 11:43.804
I do hope it's an apology.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.238
I have nothing
to apologize for,

11:45.238 --> 11:46.706
but I do have new terms.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.009
You think you're in a position
to set new terms?

11:49.009 --> 11:50.710
If you wish me
to continue my pursuit

11:50.710 --> 11:52.079
of Jacqueline de Montrachet.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.480
<i>I thought you wanted
your letters back.</i>

11:53.713 --> 11:56.016
But then again,
I did think you wanted me.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.417
Stop it, Camille.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.786
I don't know what this catfight
I'm caught up in is,

11:59.786 --> 12:02.122
but it seems far from the wager
you enticed me with,

12:02.122 --> 12:03.757
and you seem
unwilling or unable

12:03.757 --> 12:05.158
to share the truth with me.

12:06.126 --> 12:07.727
I don't owe you the truth.

12:07.727 --> 12:08.962
I'm here for what is mine.

12:08.962 --> 12:10.797
When you have done
what we agreed.

12:10.797 --> 12:13.900
Why must everything
be about you?

12:13.900 --> 12:18.438
I'm talking of my inheritance,
of my title of Vicomte.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.807
Both were taken from me
by my stepmother

12:20.807 --> 12:24.511
and her cuckoo of a son
when my father died.

12:26.213 --> 12:29.516
Really spared me the details
of who you are.

12:30.817 --> 12:33.153
- So you have a title.
- I have nothing.

12:35.021 --> 12:37.457
That's why I need you to use
your exemplary skills

12:37.457 --> 12:39.526
of manipulation and deceit.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.394
You have not lost your charm.

12:41.394 --> 12:44.197
Draw out the truth
about how this false Vicomtesse

12:44.197 --> 12:46.433
made a puppet of my father
on his deathbed

12:46.433 --> 12:48.802
to disinherit me

12:48.802 --> 12:51.104
so that I may get back
what is rightfully mine.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.773
These are my terms, Camille.

12:56.843 --> 12:58.879
Well, I'm glad I've amused you.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.981
I mean, you must see the irony.

13:02.315 --> 13:05.018
The woman you wish
to gain power over

13:05.018 --> 13:08.255
is the one woman in Paris
you can't seduce.

13:10.824 --> 13:12.392
I shouldn't have come.

13:17.063 --> 13:20.167
I know what it is
to lose everything.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.469
It's not the loss.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.070
Then what?

13:28.875 --> 13:31.278
My father chose him...

13:33.280 --> 13:36.950
...someone else's son
to love more than his own.

13:48.094 --> 13:50.530
That is not your shame
but his.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.403
Tell me where to find her.

14:19.059 --> 14:21.428
<i>The skirt I bought
the other week for the hunt,</i>

14:21.428 --> 14:23.997
<i>I want a robe à l'anglaise
to go with it.</i>

14:23.997 --> 14:26.533
Of course, Vicomtesse.
Whatever you desire.

14:26.533 --> 14:27.968
My philosophy too.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.536
The Vicomtesse de Valmont?

14:30.904 --> 14:34.074
They say the Vicomte died
with a smile on his face.

14:34.074 --> 14:36.543
Now she spends her days
collecting clothes...

14:36.543 --> 14:37.877
and gossip.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.246
<i>Slim sleeves like these?</i>

14:39.246 --> 14:41.248
Exactly. And the hair, Léonard?

14:41.248 --> 14:42.983
A wig?

14:42.983 --> 14:45.218
Like the one you had
Madame Vauqueline wear

14:45.218 --> 14:47.287
to the Comédie-Française
last week.

14:47.287 --> 14:49.089
- Yes.
- No.

14:50.290 --> 14:52.259
It should be
as the queen now wears it.

14:53.226 --> 14:55.095
With green ostrich feathers.

14:55.095 --> 14:57.130
And who are you?

14:57.130 --> 14:58.965
Mademoiselle Camille.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.902
The skirt should be
plain-colored.

15:05.005 --> 15:07.974
My guardian's wife
was a great admirer of yours.

15:07.974 --> 15:10.677
- Whose wife?
- The Marquis de Merteuil's.

15:12.245 --> 15:14.514
She was?

15:14.514 --> 15:16.616
I heard rumor
she didn't simply fall.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.287
How do you find the Marquis?

15:22.656 --> 15:26.259
He is a man not only
of... great kindness

15:26.259 --> 15:29.195
but of good taste

15:29.195 --> 15:32.332
and generosity of spirit.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.606
He is a man--
we can agree on that--

15:39.606 --> 15:41.274
and one who will soon have

15:41.274 --> 15:43.476
every eligible woman
in the city

15:43.476 --> 15:45.312
knocking on his door.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.387
Call on me for tea.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.356
We can discuss the Marquis'

15:56.356 --> 15:59.693
many qualities
and future prospects.

15:59.693 --> 16:02.062
I will look forward to it, Vicomtesse.

16:03.363 --> 16:06.032
Green ostrich plumes, Léonard.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.137
Like the queen.

16:19.279 --> 16:21.548
That's her coach.
She must still be inside.

16:21.548 --> 16:24.117
Ah, you did well
to find her, Azolan.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.318
Wait for me here.

16:30.123 --> 16:32.225
In Upper Cochin, the Tay Sons

16:32.225 --> 16:34.294
have issued edicts
of persecution

16:34.294 --> 16:36.629
against all Christians.

16:37.630 --> 16:41.267
Children have been slain
and orphaned.

16:41.267 --> 16:44.404
<i>My order has taken in
many young girls.</i>

16:44.404 --> 16:48.007
<i>We offer them shelter,
what education we can.</i>

16:48.742 --> 16:51.411
Any contribution
would be appreciated.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.184
For the children.

16:58.184 --> 16:59.219
God bless you.

17:03.790 --> 17:06.259
God bless you.

17:06.259 --> 17:07.460
Bless you.

17:08.628 --> 17:12.599
Madame de Montrachet,
you are recovered?

17:12.599 --> 17:15.368
Oh, please, Monsieur Lucienne,
I do not wish to think of it.

17:16.770 --> 17:19.606
You have my appreciation for
your kindness the other night.

17:20.473 --> 17:21.674
I've no more to say.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.643
I only want to return these.

17:23.643 --> 17:25.678
But I gave them to the sister.

17:25.678 --> 17:27.647
Forgive me,
but they look better on you.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.217
I gave twice their value.

17:31.818 --> 17:34.053
Do not embarrass me
by refusing.

17:35.054 --> 17:36.423
They were for the children.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.626
See they are returned
to the collection plate.

17:42.328 --> 17:43.730
You feel, as I do,

17:43.730 --> 17:46.399
an especial affinity
with the children.

17:48.134 --> 17:49.669
They're innocent of sin.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.439
Their suffering's undeserved.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.774
But the kingdom of God
belongs to such as these.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.743
They know only honesty,

17:56.743 --> 17:58.812
and that is the path
to our Lord.

18:01.548 --> 18:03.616
You are a man
of genuine faith in Paris,

18:03.616 --> 18:05.084
Monsieur Lucienne.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.420
It's rare to see good things.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.557
Ah, in another life, I would
have taken holy orders myself.

18:10.557 --> 18:12.525
I'm one of five,

18:12.525 --> 18:14.594
the runt of the litter.

18:14.594 --> 18:17.397
- I do not believe that.
- It is true.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.765
All brothers,

18:18.765 --> 18:21.334
all of whom wished to join
the Order of Saint Benedict.

18:21.334 --> 18:24.137
Imagine my father's pleasure.

18:24.137 --> 18:25.772
When my four brothers
took the cloth,

18:25.772 --> 18:27.540
I was instructed that,
as the youngest,

18:27.540 --> 18:29.809
I must carry the family name,

18:29.809 --> 18:32.345
inherit the fortune
that went with it.

18:32.345 --> 18:34.647
- Most would call you lucky.
- Or a fool.

18:34.647 --> 18:37.283
Still, I fail my father
by not marrying.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.553
And why is that?

18:41.588 --> 18:43.223
There has been no woman
who understood

18:43.223 --> 18:46.192
that my love of God must come
before my love of her.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.477
Mistress lost her button
from her coat.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.179
Fell behind the seat.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.514
Can I help?

19:07.514 --> 19:09.482
I-I have small hands.
It's really no trouble.

19:09.482 --> 19:11.284
Leave it, boy.

19:16.523 --> 19:17.857
I thought I would pray.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.427
Would you care to join me?

19:24.430 --> 19:25.698
Very well.

19:29.235 --> 19:30.803
<i>Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.</i>

19:30.803 --> 19:32.305
Blessed art thou among women,

19:32.305 --> 19:34.440
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

19:34.440 --> 19:36.910
Holy Mary, mother of God.

19:36.910 --> 19:38.778
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.280
Blessed art thou among women,

19:40.280 --> 19:42.849
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

19:42.849 --> 19:44.584
<i>Holy Mary, mother of God.</i>

19:44.584 --> 19:45.585
Grace. The lord is with thee.

19:45.585 --> 19:46.753
Blessed art thou among women,

19:46.753 --> 19:49.255
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

19:49.255 --> 19:51.491
Holy Mary, mother of God.

19:51.491 --> 19:53.326
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

19:53.326 --> 19:54.494
Blessed art thou among women,

19:54.494 --> 19:57.497
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

19:57.497 --> 19:59.499
Holy Mary, mother of God.

19:59.499 --> 20:00.533
Hail Mary, full--

20:01.834 --> 20:03.269
What are you doing?

20:03.269 --> 20:04.771
The saint's uncorrupted heart

20:04.771 --> 20:06.839
moved me to pray with you.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.875
I have offended you.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.311
Madame de Montrachet, please!

20:27.327 --> 20:31.531
Madame de Montrachet is
buttoned tighter than her coat.

20:31.531 --> 20:32.865
It's not as tight as it was.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.267
Mm.

20:35.702 --> 20:38.338
The coat, uh, it lost a button.

20:41.474 --> 20:42.642
The coachman and the maid

20:42.642 --> 20:43.776
were looking for the button
from her coat

20:43.776 --> 20:45.278
while you were
attending the meeting.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.581
Looking where?

20:49.649 --> 20:51.618
In the coach.

20:51.618 --> 20:52.952
Together?

20:54.253 --> 20:56.522
Yes.

21:23.316 --> 21:25.284
What do you think you're doing?

21:25.284 --> 21:26.319
More to the point,
what are you doing?

21:26.319 --> 21:27.520
He's a gentleman!

21:27.520 --> 21:28.821
And you are fornicators.

21:28.821 --> 21:30.023
What would your mistress think
if she knew

21:30.023 --> 21:31.591
that you were rutting
in her coach?

21:31.591 --> 21:33.593
- We would be ruined, sir.
- Mm.

21:33.593 --> 21:35.495
How much to keep quiet?

21:35.495 --> 21:38.665
The suggestion that you could
buy me off is offensive.

21:38.665 --> 21:41.067
Throw your fat-knuckled punch.
It'll hurt you more than me.

21:42.335 --> 21:43.870
Go cool that hot head.

21:44.904 --> 21:47.040
For her, not you.

21:47.040 --> 21:49.509
Yes, yes.
We don't have all day.

21:53.046 --> 21:55.081
Monsieur, you cannot
tell our mistress.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.549
<i>Please.</i>

21:56.549 --> 21:59.052
Do exactly as I instruct,

21:59.052 --> 22:01.421
and she'll never hear of this.

22:12.465 --> 22:13.966
What are you doing?

22:13.966 --> 22:16.536
Madame, I feel unwell. May I?

22:16.536 --> 22:18.438
Well, you should have said.

22:25.945 --> 22:28.614
Isn't that the man from
the Foreign Mission Society?

22:30.850 --> 22:32.919
Olivier, stop the carriage!

22:34.554 --> 22:36.489
Fetch that boy to me.

22:36.489 --> 22:38.991
Now, Suzette, before he goes.

22:50.803 --> 22:52.739
What's wrong with your leg?

22:52.739 --> 22:55.842
Uh, crushed by a noble's horse, Madame.

22:55.842 --> 22:57.143
There's worse things in life.

22:57.376 --> 22:59.645
My parents were taken
by the pox.

22:59.645 --> 23:02.381
- Oh, you poor child.
- I don't need anyone's pity.

23:03.983 --> 23:06.886
Olivier, give the boy
what money you have on you.

23:18.131 --> 23:19.699
Thank you, my lady.

23:19.699 --> 23:21.801
So tell me, what business
did you have

23:21.801 --> 23:23.569
with Monsieur Lucienne?

23:23.569 --> 23:24.937
I'm sworn to secrecy,

23:24.937 --> 23:27.540
but since you paid me,

23:27.540 --> 23:29.876
I'm to be a student
at his school for orphans

23:29.876 --> 23:31.677
when he's raised
the money for it.

23:32.478 --> 23:33.880
And thank you.

23:44.123 --> 23:45.792
Oh, she believed you.

23:45.792 --> 23:47.193
I believed myself.

23:49.162 --> 23:51.631
And the world's
a cruel place for orphans.

23:51.631 --> 23:53.599
You should find some
and give that to them.

23:53.599 --> 23:57.069
Oh, what an excellent idea, Azolan.

23:57.069 --> 24:00.907
Some for you...
and some for me.

24:00.907 --> 24:02.675
The game is on.

24:22.061 --> 24:23.563
You haven't been in Paris
long enough

24:23.563 --> 24:25.231
to meet my son, Prévan.

24:25.464 --> 24:26.666
<i>He was, until recently,</i>

24:26.666 --> 24:29.569
<i>the most eligible bachelor
in town, but...</i>

24:29.569 --> 24:32.538
he is to be married
to Cécile de Volanges,

24:32.538 --> 24:33.773
a daughter of the Duke.

24:38.611 --> 24:42.715
So... tell me,
now we are alone.

24:42.715 --> 24:43.916
Was marriage to Jean

24:43.916 --> 24:46.619
the reason why his wife
jumped to her death?

24:47.887 --> 24:50.857
There are rumors he was
never faithful to her.

24:50.857 --> 24:52.892
As I said, Vicomtesse,

24:52.892 --> 24:54.794
the Marquis is a good man.

24:55.995 --> 24:59.999
That was not your implication
at Madame Berthe's.

24:59.999 --> 25:01.634
I may be blunt?

25:02.902 --> 25:04.604
I let you believe so.

25:05.671 --> 25:07.273
I hoped I might befriend you.

25:08.507 --> 25:09.642
You thought such an alliance

25:09.642 --> 25:11.143
would be to your advantage.

25:11.143 --> 25:12.778
I feel naive,

25:12.778 --> 25:14.914
exposed here.

25:14.914 --> 25:17.516
And I have no guardian now
to guide me.

25:22.121 --> 25:25.091
We are cut from the same cloth.

25:29.528 --> 25:32.231
To get what you truly want
in this city,

25:32.231 --> 25:34.200
you must destroy everything

25:34.200 --> 25:38.271
and everyone
that stands between you and it.

25:38.271 --> 25:39.972
How, Vicomtesse?

25:41.040 --> 25:43.175
By showing no mercy.

25:43.175 --> 25:45.144
Is that your own experience?

25:46.545 --> 25:49.115
Camille, I'm almost offended.

25:49.982 --> 25:54.320
You must think of my words
as that of a mentor's.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.188
Theoretical examples.

25:57.657 --> 25:59.225
Let me finish now
with some advice

25:59.225 --> 26:01.193
if you wish to thrive here.

26:01.193 --> 26:02.628
Make a good match,

26:02.628 --> 26:06.232
an alliance of beauty, brains,

26:06.232 --> 26:08.801
and a rich and powerful husband.

26:09.936 --> 26:11.737
I am almost cursing myself

26:11.737 --> 26:14.106
I did not move more swiftly
on your Marquis.

26:14.106 --> 26:15.708
Well, he is unlikely to marry.

26:15.708 --> 26:17.677
His wife is only recently gone.

26:17.677 --> 26:19.979
My second piece of advice:

26:19.979 --> 26:23.182
keep your ear at every door.

26:23.182 --> 26:24.951
You've been asleep, Camille.

26:27.053 --> 26:29.822
Jean de Merteuil
is already bound to be married

26:29.822 --> 26:32.358
to Emilie de Sevigny.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.860
That... hyena
of a mother of hers

26:34.860 --> 26:37.163
has caught him by the throat.

26:37.163 --> 26:40.933
Strike fast and without fear,

26:40.933 --> 26:42.301
or lose.

26:47.340 --> 26:49.842
One must admire her...

26:49.842 --> 26:51.043
from a distance, of course.

26:51.043 --> 26:52.311
She's quite lethal.

26:57.984 --> 27:00.019
No one ever
bought me a dress.

27:01.687 --> 27:02.788
What do you think?

27:04.724 --> 27:07.326
You will look lovely, mademoiselle.

27:13.366 --> 27:14.700
All right, this one.

27:16.335 --> 27:18.404
<i>Wrap it.</i>

27:20.873 --> 27:22.875
I don't know
how to thank you.

27:24.677 --> 27:26.679
Five livres.

27:26.679 --> 27:29.415
Oh, when can I have it?

27:29.648 --> 27:31.784
It's not for you.

27:31.784 --> 27:33.919
- You said to--
- Choose a dress...

27:35.688 --> 27:37.323
...which you have done.

27:37.323 --> 27:39.692
<i>If that was not clear,</i>

27:39.692 --> 27:41.761
accept my apologies.

27:43.929 --> 27:45.364
It was not clear.

27:48.901 --> 27:51.337
<i>God be with you.</i>

27:51.337 --> 27:52.838
<i>And with you.</i>

28:07.820 --> 28:09.355
Madame de Montrachet.

28:11.057 --> 28:14.427
I wanted to apologize
for my behavior at the chapel.

28:14.427 --> 28:16.462
My actions were
totally out of character.

28:16.695 --> 28:17.930
- I never imagined...
- I believe you.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.265
...I'd meet a woman
who loved our Savior

28:19.265 --> 28:20.466
with the same devotion--

28:22.001 --> 28:23.069
You do?

28:23.069 --> 28:25.037
I had hoped to see you.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.205
You're trying to set up
a school

28:26.205 --> 28:28.374
for the poor orphans
of the city.

28:28.374 --> 28:30.009
It doesn't matter how I know.

28:30.009 --> 28:31.177
Might I venture

28:31.177 --> 28:33.212
that since you were denied
your vocation,

28:33.212 --> 28:34.914
you feel compelled
to serve God

28:34.914 --> 28:37.416
by helping those less fortunate
than yourself?

28:38.918 --> 28:41.287
None more so than the children.

28:41.287 --> 28:45.224
The kingdom of God
belongs to such as these.

28:46.892 --> 28:49.228
I will see you have some money
for your school.

28:49.228 --> 28:50.930
I cannot accept
your kind offer.

28:50.930 --> 28:53.432
Well, then I cannot accept
your apology.

28:56.168 --> 28:58.804
It will bind us together
in venture.

29:00.873 --> 29:02.074
So be it.

29:21.293 --> 29:24.363
You are well again, I see.

29:25.297 --> 29:26.899
The opposite.

29:26.899 --> 29:28.501
I am sickened.

29:34.340 --> 29:36.408
You like these pretty things.

29:38.177 --> 29:39.812
I'll see that you have more.

29:43.249 --> 29:45.251
Now that I think of it,

29:45.251 --> 29:46.952
a little bird in the kitchen

29:46.952 --> 29:48.854
told me you were fond
of bonbons.

29:48.854 --> 29:50.956
Is that why you're here, Monsieur,

29:50.956 --> 29:53.159
to offer me pretty things
and bonbons?

29:53.159 --> 29:54.560
Well, there must be
something you want.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.028
For what?

29:57.062 --> 29:59.398
You're not naive.
Don't act as if you are.

30:00.466 --> 30:03.903
- The letter.
- There. See?

30:03.903 --> 30:06.138
Far smarter than your mistress.

30:06.138 --> 30:08.140
Name your price.

30:08.140 --> 30:11.443
For betraying my friend
or dishonoring myself?

30:11.443 --> 30:13.379
Perhaps you have money
for both.

30:17.082 --> 30:18.317
Who is Ariadne?

30:20.085 --> 30:22.254
Ariadne was a girl like you.

30:23.322 --> 30:25.257
A waif, a stray.

30:25.257 --> 30:27.126
Unloved, unnoticed.

30:28.494 --> 30:31.030
The sort of girl that adds
nothing to the world.

30:32.097 --> 30:35.034
My wife brought her in
for companionship as...

30:35.034 --> 30:36.902
one would a cat.

30:36.902 --> 30:39.972
And when she grew tired of her,

30:39.972 --> 30:42.241
she threw out the cat.

30:43.842 --> 30:46.412
Give me the letter,
or I will drag it from you!

30:50.983 --> 30:53.419
Child, what is the matter?

31:06.365 --> 31:07.533
It's Jean!

31:07.533 --> 31:09.568
He's searching our room,
searching for the letter.

31:09.568 --> 31:11.203
He will not rest
until he finds it.

31:11.203 --> 31:12.504
We have to go now, Camille.

31:12.504 --> 31:14.139
Go! Anywhere. Now.

31:15.207 --> 31:17.142
Did he hurt you?

33:00.379 --> 33:01.980
May we come in?

33:01.980 --> 33:03.515
I'm entertaining.

33:04.516 --> 33:05.718
But do join us.

33:13.659 --> 33:15.327
Azolan...

33:15.327 --> 33:16.662
how are you?

33:16.662 --> 33:18.497
Uh, thank you for asking,
my lady.

33:18.497 --> 33:22.067
Um, we're just having some
boiled grain and squirrel stew,

33:22.067 --> 33:24.670
- if you'd care for some.
- I suspect she's already eaten.

33:24.670 --> 33:26.705
Yes. I'm afraid so.

33:26.705 --> 33:28.207
Maybe the little thief
is hungry.

33:28.207 --> 33:30.376
Rather a thief
than a faithless blackmailer.

33:30.376 --> 33:34.079
Now, I can't tell if you speak
of me or your mistress.

33:35.614 --> 33:38.117
Victoire, please wait outside.

33:45.357 --> 33:47.259
Take her some stew, Azolan.

33:58.270 --> 34:00.105
You have made progress
with my stepmother?

34:00.105 --> 34:01.707
There is
a more pressing matter.

34:01.707 --> 34:03.809
Madame left a note.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.477
That's how I've been
maintaining my place

34:05.477 --> 34:06.812
in Saint-Honoré.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.515
Leave others' words alone,
or you will choke on them.

34:09.515 --> 34:11.550
Something I think
you've learned at first hand.

34:11.550 --> 34:14.219
Did she ever talk to you
of a girl she befriended?

34:14.219 --> 34:16.655
Merteuil was never
a woman for friends.

34:16.655 --> 34:18.690
The girl was Ariadne.

34:21.059 --> 34:23.629
Valmont,
I see you know this name.

34:23.629 --> 34:25.464
And if I do?

34:31.470 --> 34:33.071
We might trade.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.541
Trade what? Hmm?

34:39.812 --> 34:42.114
I took tea
with Ondine de Valmont

34:42.114 --> 34:43.315
this afternoon.

34:43.315 --> 34:45.684
You have made progress quickly.
And?

34:45.684 --> 34:47.786
My first card is on the table.

34:47.786 --> 34:50.355
Ah, and I may have heard
of this Ariadne.

34:50.355 --> 34:51.523
And?

34:51.523 --> 34:53.592
I'm already
your stepmother's friend.

34:53.592 --> 34:55.627
It will take longer

34:55.627 --> 34:57.229
to become her confidante.

34:57.229 --> 34:59.731
Ah, one card,
and you're played out.

35:04.837 --> 35:06.238
Not quite.

35:07.372 --> 35:08.774
Ondine is ambitious.

35:08.774 --> 35:10.375
Wealth is not enough.

35:10.375 --> 35:12.578
She wants power.

35:12.578 --> 35:14.446
She is in the market
for a husband

35:14.446 --> 35:16.248
who can give her
what she desires.

35:16.248 --> 35:18.150
Has she no shame?

35:20.219 --> 35:21.887
Ariadne,

35:22.120 --> 35:24.122
a girl Madame
brought into the house

35:24.122 --> 35:26.525
and filled with ideas
above her station?

35:26.525 --> 35:29.528
I doubt she was a girl Madame
would have spent a moment with,

35:29.528 --> 35:31.396
let alone brought
into her house.

35:34.399 --> 35:36.902
Then from where
may you have heard

35:37.135 --> 35:38.270
of Ariadne?

35:38.270 --> 35:40.339
There's a private club,

35:40.339 --> 35:42.207
the kind a man
might not to wish to advertise

35:42.207 --> 35:44.643
he has affiliations with in...

35:44.643 --> 35:46.378
polite society.

35:47.513 --> 35:49.581
It's called The Labyrinth.

35:49.581 --> 35:50.749
You've been there?

35:50.749 --> 35:53.285
No, but I've heard mention
of this Ariadne.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.687
<i>The name stuck with me.</i>

35:55.687 --> 35:56.788
<i>It's uncommon.</i>

35:57.723 --> 35:58.757
Where is it?

35:58.757 --> 36:01.193
Only men may cross
the threshold.

36:10.469 --> 36:12.538
Then you'll have to help me.

36:14.773 --> 36:16.241
Please.

36:55.948 --> 36:58.483
You've made progress
in your seduction

36:58.483 --> 37:00.485
of Madame de Montrachet?

37:00.485 --> 37:02.321
I have.

37:02.321 --> 37:03.722
She believes you love God.

37:03.722 --> 37:07.659
And I will convince her that
she means more to me than Him.

37:07.659 --> 37:11.697
And after that,
she will open herself to you?

37:11.697 --> 37:14.866
Like a flower
opens itself to sunlight.

37:30.782 --> 37:31.783
Now?

37:32.818 --> 37:34.386
The necktie.

37:35.854 --> 37:37.656
What else?

37:37.656 --> 37:39.291
Of course.

37:56.341 --> 37:58.043
Where did you get it?

37:58.276 --> 37:59.745
I forget.

37:59.745 --> 38:01.380
It's of no importance.

38:09.755 --> 38:11.923
Finishing touch.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.603
You like how it feels?

38:28.807 --> 38:30.075
Yes.

38:31.543 --> 38:33.779
Imagining the world
and everything in it

38:33.779 --> 38:35.847
is mine to have.

38:52.531 --> 38:53.965
Or not.

38:58.070 --> 38:59.771
As I wish.

39:08.847 --> 39:10.882
I thought we might talk.

39:11.883 --> 39:13.085
Marquis?

39:14.119 --> 39:16.021
You think I did not love her,

39:16.021 --> 39:18.957
my wife, don't you?

39:18.957 --> 39:21.093
<i>I can see it in your eyes.</i>

39:21.093 --> 39:22.961
It's not my place
to have an opinion.

39:22.961 --> 39:24.830
But you do.

39:24.830 --> 39:26.998
You kept her letter from me.
That's an opinion.

39:28.433 --> 39:30.769
I've had time to reflect, and...

39:30.769 --> 39:32.404
I'm glad you did it.

39:33.672 --> 39:35.440
Thank you, Majordome.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.642
<i>You honored my wife's memory.</i>

39:38.610 --> 39:40.779
You protected her,
as I failed to do.

39:41.980 --> 39:44.049
And that is something
I must live with.

39:49.521 --> 39:51.590
I'm going to do better
in my new marriage.

39:51.590 --> 39:53.492
You're getting married?

39:53.492 --> 39:55.560
And I'll return to the island.

39:57.662 --> 39:58.964
But I'm torn.

40:00.499 --> 40:02.467
Do I close up this house...

40:03.869 --> 40:05.103
...or leave it in the care
of the man

40:05.103 --> 40:06.905
who loves it beyond all others?

40:08.173 --> 40:11.710
<i>In short, do I trust you
as my wife trusted you?</i>

40:11.710 --> 40:13.879
And why did she trust you?

40:13.879 --> 40:15.747
Because I cared for her.

40:17.516 --> 40:19.985
And you cared for her wishes.

40:24.489 --> 40:27.659
The last thing she ever did
was to write me that note.

40:27.659 --> 40:30.695
The last thing she ever wanted
was for me to see it.

40:32.531 --> 40:34.633
And that's the truth, isn't it?

40:36.835 --> 40:37.936
Yes.

40:39.004 --> 40:41.573
And will you betray
her last wish?

41:19.711 --> 41:22.848
You are my Majordome after all.

42:02.621 --> 42:03.855
If you value your life,

42:03.855 --> 42:05.624
see she gets out safe.

42:05.624 --> 42:08.026
Oh, your understated charm
will take you places

42:08.026 --> 42:09.794
you cannot imagine.

42:09.794 --> 42:12.564
Find me a coach.
Have it waiting.

42:18.837 --> 42:20.538
On whose invitation?

43:03.214 --> 43:05.183
Your name, Monsieur?

43:05.183 --> 43:06.751
Valmont.

43:06.751 --> 43:08.720
The Vicomtesse's son?

43:08.720 --> 43:10.055
<i>The Vicomte's son.</i>

43:10.889 --> 43:12.857
With Prévan, my stepbrother.

43:16.761 --> 43:18.129
Who do you desire?

43:21.132 --> 43:22.200
Ariadne.

43:38.783 --> 43:41.653
The Vicomte chooses you, Ariadne.

43:55.867 --> 43:57.168
We're together.

43:57.168 --> 43:59.237
Man is born
alone and dies alone.

43:59.237 --> 44:02.674
In between, he must find his
way through the labyrinth...

44:02.674 --> 44:04.109
alone.

44:09.714 --> 44:12.717
See that those two
don't leave the club.

44:12.717 --> 44:14.919
Mm-hmm.

44:46.317 --> 44:48.820
How is... business?

44:50.355 --> 44:52.891
Must you lock the door?

44:52.891 --> 44:54.426
Confinement vexes me.

44:54.426 --> 44:56.828
Besides, I really must
get back to my brother.

44:56.828 --> 44:57.996
Stepbrother.

44:57.996 --> 45:00.832
After you have bound yourself.

45:22.387 --> 45:25.924
I feel a slight chill.
I might warm myself first.

45:28.793 --> 45:30.762
I will warm you.

45:32.730 --> 45:34.399
I feel a great thirst.

45:34.399 --> 45:36.401
Let us send for some wine.

45:39.370 --> 45:42.340
A talent of mine is
the anticipation of your needs.

45:47.378 --> 45:51.049
Mm, I believe
all pleasure is in...

45:51.049 --> 45:52.750
anticipation.

45:54.252 --> 45:57.489
Not all of it, surely.

46:06.931 --> 46:09.767
What are you here for, Vicomte?

46:14.439 --> 46:16.307
What does anyone want from you?

46:16.307 --> 46:18.042
Well...

46:18.042 --> 46:20.512
- men want to fuck me.
- Mm-hmm.

46:20.512 --> 46:25.083
And though you clearly
have balls,

46:25.083 --> 46:27.085
they're not
where they should be.

46:28.953 --> 46:31.556
And if you were the Vicomte,

46:31.789 --> 46:34.292
you would have chosen Theseus,

46:34.292 --> 46:36.327
not Ariadne.

46:38.163 --> 46:40.565
Prévan likes hard bodies.

46:42.100 --> 46:44.335
Who are you?

46:44.335 --> 46:46.104
And don't lie,
or Monsieur Darcque

46:46.104 --> 46:48.039
will cut us both a new smile.

46:49.307 --> 46:51.543
I am a friend of a friend.

46:51.543 --> 46:54.412
What friend
do we have in common?

46:55.346 --> 46:57.482
- The Marquise de Merteuil.
- Mm.

46:58.983 --> 47:01.052
She was no friend of ours.

47:02.053 --> 47:04.989
You must do better... friend,

47:04.989 --> 47:07.058
or you will not
leave this room.

47:09.127 --> 47:11.262
They can see us
through the walls.

47:15.133 --> 47:16.868
Kiss me.

47:29.380 --> 47:31.482
I will need
some help with this.

47:32.617 --> 47:34.586
You'll have to do better
than that.

47:40.291 --> 47:42.026
I beg you.

47:50.401 --> 47:52.103
I seem to have
the hang of this.

47:53.304 --> 47:55.907
Forgive me.

47:55.907 --> 47:58.243
If I wasn't in such a rush...

47:58.243 --> 47:59.510
That's what they all say.

48:01.246 --> 48:02.513
Close your eyes.

48:04.215 --> 48:05.516
Count to ten.

48:07.418 --> 48:08.653
Hmm.

48:08.886 --> 48:10.922
Hey!

48:12.257 --> 48:15.293
She wanted
your forgiveness...

48:15.293 --> 48:16.661
Ariadne.

48:18.029 --> 48:21.099
"The bitter secret
our marriage bore.

48:21.099 --> 48:24.302
Forgive me."
Those were her last words.

48:24.302 --> 48:26.037
What do they mean?

48:26.037 --> 48:28.906
It's we who should have asked
her forgiveness.

48:28.906 --> 48:31.909
The things we do here
condemn us all to hell.

48:32.677 --> 48:34.178
Who's "we"?

48:34.178 --> 48:37.315
She spoke only of you,
of Ariadne.

48:38.383 --> 48:40.151
Why should I trust you?

48:41.386 --> 48:43.254
Because I have been
where you are.

48:47.558 --> 48:50.361
We are all Ariadnes here.

49:02.273 --> 49:06.444
Aah!

49:08.046 --> 49:09.514
The Marquis.

49:11.616 --> 49:13.551
He comes to you?

49:13.551 --> 49:15.320
No.

49:20.158 --> 49:22.126
He owns us.

49:24.162 --> 49:26.631
Merteuil.

49:26.631 --> 49:28.232
We draw secrets like kisses

49:28.232 --> 49:30.101
from the men who come here

49:30.101 --> 49:31.169
for the Marquis.

49:31.169 --> 49:32.570
What secrets?

49:32.570 --> 49:35.239
All those little indiscretions
a man may share

49:35.239 --> 49:37.608
when he comes...

49:37.608 --> 49:40.178
are given to him.

49:40.178 --> 49:43.181
Secrets to be used
in the future.

49:43.181 --> 49:44.649
The more we draw,

49:44.649 --> 49:46.651
the more chance
we'll be given our freedom.

49:49.654 --> 49:53.358
Do not draw more suspicion
than you already have.

50:06.471 --> 50:09.474
- Camille?
- <i>Harder, harder!</i>

50:09.474 --> 50:11.109
<i>Harder!</i>

50:18.483 --> 50:19.484
Camille?

50:22.520 --> 50:25.089
<i>Harder! Harder!</i>

50:27.625 --> 50:29.360
Who the hell are you?

50:29.360 --> 50:30.728
Guard!

50:37.034 --> 50:38.503
Get out of here.

50:39.637 --> 50:40.738
<i>Camille!</i>

50:41.773 --> 50:42.774
We have to go.

50:52.784 --> 50:55.086
<i>Camille, now!</i>

50:59.757 --> 51:00.758
That's him.

51:02.527 --> 51:04.295
The servants' stairs. Go.

51:17.842 --> 51:18.843
Over here!

51:24.482 --> 51:25.583
Go! Go!

51:31.389 --> 51:32.857
I didn't know you were so fast!

51:33.090 --> 51:35.092
It's easier to run as a man.

51:35.092 --> 51:36.727
And then the girl--
you were kissing her.

51:36.727 --> 51:39.397
It's good manners, isn't it,
to kiss afterwards?

51:40.731 --> 51:42.533
Who was the naked man?

51:42.533 --> 51:44.268
We weren't formally introduced.

51:44.268 --> 51:46.771
Bore a striking resemblance
to the archbishop of Paris.

51:46.771 --> 51:48.139
My God!

51:48.139 --> 51:49.574
Well?

51:49.574 --> 51:50.842
I know Jean's secret.

51:50.842 --> 51:52.810
I know what Ariadne means.

51:52.810 --> 51:54.245
Thank you.

51:54.245 --> 51:57.148
At your service,
as you are at mine.

51:57.148 --> 51:59.550
I will visit Ondine again.

51:59.550 --> 52:01.285
And we'll have
further adventures.

52:02.854 --> 52:05.256
Is that not what brothers do?

52:36.621 --> 52:39.323
The world is a little kinder
to us orphans tonight,

52:39.323 --> 52:40.558
my friend.

52:51.402 --> 52:53.471
I couldn't stop him.

52:55.172 --> 52:56.941
What are you talking about?

52:57.174 --> 53:00.578
He demanded the letter.

53:00.578 --> 53:02.747
And you simply gave it to him?

53:02.747 --> 53:04.782
He is master of this house.

53:05.816 --> 53:06.918
Where is he?

53:06.918 --> 53:09.754
Gone...
to his engagement party.

53:09.754 --> 53:12.223
He's marrying
Emilie de Sevigny,

53:12.223 --> 53:14.692
<i>and he left instructions
for me to ensure</i>

53:14.692 --> 53:16.761
<i>that you left this house.</i>

53:18.863 --> 53:21.198
I'm sorry, mademoiselle,
it was...

53:21.198 --> 53:23.234
the letter or my place here.

53:23.234 --> 53:25.770
He'll regret
how he's treated us both.

53:26.571 --> 53:28.873
Mademoiselle...

53:28.873 --> 53:32.777
I would advise
that you leave this house.

53:32.777 --> 53:35.513
The Marquis can do
whatever he wants

53:35.513 --> 53:37.515
without consequence.

53:37.515 --> 53:41.552
You can't win
against that sort of power.

53:45.590 --> 53:47.825
You don't know me.

53:52.263 --> 53:54.231
You don't know me, Majordome.
