That he thought maybe
he should get a lawyer.

- I have to admit, Mr. Coffee,
you're splitting hairs.

"I think I need my lawyer,"

Cognitively, he knows.

Okay? Okay.
Bye-bye.

28:00.107 --> 28:01.974
I'm very sorry.

28:02.040 --> 28:04.774
You've never done
an asbestos litigation,
have you?

28:04.840 --> 28:08.274
No, but that's not the problem.

28:08.340 --> 28:11.374
- Can I cut to what
I do perceive as a problem?
- Absolutely.

28:11.440 --> 28:14.807
I had a chance to look over
some of the pleadings
and witness lists.

28:14.874 --> 28:18.240
Public record. Sorry.
We may have a difference
in trial philosophy.

28:18.307 --> 28:20.907
Which would be?
You seem to be
emphasizing causation.

28:20.974 --> 28:22.907
On these kinds of cases,
we tend not to.

28:22.974 --> 28:25.107
How do you prove a case
without causation?

28:25.174 --> 28:28.340
Well, I'm not saying ignore it,
but when proving it
depends on science,

28:28.407 --> 28:30.340
you're putting
two heavy burdens on a jury.

28:30.407 --> 28:31.940
One, you're asking them
to understand it.

28:32.007 --> 28:34.074
Two, you're asking them
to stay awake.

28:34.140 --> 28:36.707
Anything they don't understand,
they get suspicious of.

28:36.774 --> 28:40.174
And with asbestos,
just like tobacco,
you have a presumption.

28:40.240 --> 28:42.040
They already know it kills.

28:42.107 --> 28:45.574
The defense can't
pick apart that premise.

28:45.640 --> 28:47.640
They <i>can</i> pick apart science.

28:47.707 --> 28:50.174
I'm wary of
leaving evidence out.

28:50.240 --> 28:53.874
Yeah, that's what I figured.

28:53.940 --> 28:56.707
We're probably not
the right firm for you.

29:02.040 --> 29:03.974
Be seated.

29:08.940 --> 29:13.140
Under
<i>Minnick versus Mississippi,</i>
the law is quite clear.

29:13.207 --> 29:17.440
When a suspect asks for
his attorney, all further
interrogation must stop.

29:18.940 --> 29:21.074
The tape here
was very disturbing,

29:21.140 --> 29:23.707
seeing the police lie
about having witnesses,

29:23.774 --> 29:26.774
misrepresenting information.

29:26.840 --> 29:30.940
Nevertheless,
this kind of police conduct
is entirely permissible.

29:31.007 --> 29:35.707
And since we find
the defendant stopped short
of directly asking for counsel,

29:36.874 --> 29:40.607
we unanimously find
the confession to be admissible.

29:40.674 --> 29:42.607
The conviction
therefore stands.

32:23.365 --> 32:26.599
Yeah. You remember
what he went to jail for?

32:28.432 --> 32:31.132
They thought he knocked off
a liquor store
and capped somebody.

32:31.199 --> 32:34.299
But he didn't, right?
Yeah.

32:34.365 --> 32:38.765
And, uh, the reason
he ended up in prison...

32:38.832 --> 32:43.332
was that he fit the description
of whoever did do it,
and the police arrested him.

32:43.399 --> 32:47.632
They kept him in a room
for 20 hours.

32:47.699 --> 32:51.999
Kept makin' him drink coffee
and not lettin' him
go to the bathroom.

32:52.065 --> 32:55.799
Kept tellin' him
that if he'd just confess,

32:55.865 --> 32:57.832
that everything
would go better.

32:57.899 --> 32:59.899
And that if he didn't confess,

32:59.965 --> 33:05.599
they'd arrest my sister

get the death penalty.

33:05.665 --> 33:09.399

33:09.465 --> 33:11.365
he could leave.

33:12.999 --> 33:15.099

33:16.399 --> 33:18.532
they had him to the point...

33:18.599 --> 33:21.232
where he would say anything
just to go home.

33:43.265 --> 33:45.732

33:45.799 --> 33:48.965

33:49.032 --> 33:52.232
