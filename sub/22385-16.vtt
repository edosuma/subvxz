WEBVTT

00:04.619 --> 00:06.319
Why were you tailing us?

00:09.625 --> 00:11.193
Stop!

00:13.661 --> 00:15.195
Another 50,000 volts

00:15.231 --> 00:17.029
and you'll fry
his frontal cortex,

00:17.065 --> 00:18.331
then he's useless
to us.

00:18.367 --> 00:21.037
Give him a 30-second recovery.

00:22.238 --> 00:24.037
Have you ever heard
of the pain scale?

00:24.073 --> 00:25.738
Doctors use it, you know:

00:25.774 --> 00:27.639
"How much does it hurt
from 1 to 10?"

00:27.675 --> 00:30.145
It's a nice,
neat concept.

00:32.415 --> 00:33.146
Take it from someone

00:33.182 --> 00:35.782
who knows what a "10"
feels like.

00:35.818 --> 00:39.122
Death is preferable.

00:43.291 --> 00:43.956
Go again.

00:53.669 --> 00:55.167
I hate it.

00:55.203 --> 00:57.770
- I can't with this anymore.
- What is the matter with you?

00:57.806 --> 00:59.271
It's too sweet.

00:59.307 --> 01:00.440
You've said that
about all of them!

01:00.476 --> 01:02.108
I didn't say that
about the banana cake

01:02.144 --> 01:03.410
which you guys
threw in the trash.

01:03.446 --> 01:04.742
Where it clearly belonged.

01:04.779 --> 01:06.579
Hey, what's with
the breakfast cake?

01:06.615 --> 01:09.215
Meg gave me some decisions
to make for the wedding.

01:09.251 --> 01:10.249
All right, do you want a hand?
'Cause I'm kind of

01:10.285 --> 01:12.117
an expert at this stuff now.

01:12.153 --> 01:14.320
Oh, look at this,
this is nice.

01:14.356 --> 01:15.588
Kind of reminds me
of the time

01:15.624 --> 01:17.189
my prison family
baked a cake

01:17.225 --> 01:19.294
for Vinny's wedding
to his stalker.

01:20.228 --> 01:23.099
Patterson, got something
for you.

01:24.600 --> 01:26.036
How's the carrot?

01:27.403 --> 01:29.071
What are you
telling me, exactly?

01:30.206 --> 01:32.308
There has to be
something else we can do.

01:33.843 --> 01:35.707
Nothing is irreversible.

01:41.117 --> 01:43.053
Look, I'll have
to call you back.

01:46.821 --> 01:48.787
Everything all right?

01:48.823 --> 01:51.323
Yeah, yeah, I was just
talking to my doctor.

01:51.359 --> 01:53.126
I've been getting these
headaches, but, uh...

01:53.162 --> 01:54.394
nothing to worry about.

01:54.430 --> 01:55.361
I hope not.

01:55.397 --> 01:57.263
I've got a new
task for you.

01:57.299 --> 01:58.764
We're flying out tomorrow.

01:58.800 --> 02:00.532
Blake's charity gala...
She'll be thrilled.

02:00.568 --> 02:03.168
She'll be thrilled because
of the reason I'm attending.

02:03.204 --> 02:06.105
Bruyere... he's finally
playing ball.

02:06.141 --> 02:07.272
He's ready to make
the land deal.

02:07.308 --> 02:09.174
- Tomorrow?
- Mm-hmm.

02:09.210 --> 02:10.442
That's great news.

02:10.478 --> 02:11.810
I can't overstate what
a critical step this is.

02:15.750 --> 02:17.316
Ms. Baker.

02:17.352 --> 02:19.786
Give me a moment
and I will find them.

02:19.822 --> 02:21.491
Be right back.

02:32.935 --> 02:34.534
Right, you remember
this one,

02:34.570 --> 02:37.470
the dragonfly tattoo?
We solved it a few weeks ago?

02:37.506 --> 02:39.471
Led to a thread on a message
board, but it was empty.

02:39.507 --> 02:40.239
Until an hour ago.

02:40.275 --> 02:42.208
Two users started
a conversation,

02:42.244 --> 02:44.776
Dragonfly164
and Atlantic17.

02:44.812 --> 02:46.345
Cool names, guys.

02:46.381 --> 02:49.281
After Atlantic replied,
the messages disappeared so...

02:49.317 --> 02:50.816
I'm thinking maybe they did
a little scruba-dub-dub?

02:50.852 --> 02:53.452
Which means there could
be older messages as well.

02:53.488 --> 02:54.853
Let's see if we
can dig 'em up.

02:54.889 --> 02:56.221
That's why I brought you
in here.

02:56.257 --> 02:58.357
Hey, sorry,
uh, to interrupt

02:58.393 --> 02:59.893
but I need to talk to you,
Patterson.

02:59.929 --> 03:01.560
Oh, sure,
yeah, totally.

03:01.596 --> 03:03.495
I wouldn't wanna manterrupt
two women...

03:03.531 --> 03:05.231
Wait, no, manterrupting
is when...

03:05.267 --> 03:06.766
Sorry, now I'm mansplaining
manterrupting.

03:06.802 --> 03:08.201
I'll google it.

03:08.237 --> 03:11.337
Okay, this just came in.
It's gotta be Roman.

03:11.373 --> 03:12.839
Another clue to
a tattoo?

03:12.875 --> 03:14.641
I don't know,
I can't open it.

03:14.677 --> 03:17.510
Whoa, the encryption is
a lot heavier this time.

03:17.546 --> 03:19.244
Why is he upping
his encryption?

03:19.280 --> 03:21.847
The only reason to encrypt
a text this way would be

03:21.883 --> 03:23.282
to ensure that
it couldn't be read

03:23.318 --> 03:24.383
if it fell into
the wrong hands.

03:24.419 --> 03:25.851
Why would he think
my phone

03:25.887 --> 03:27.387
could fall
into the wrong hands?

03:27.423 --> 03:30.256
Maybe it's his phone
he's worried about.

03:30.292 --> 03:31.423
♪ Hello ♪

03:31.459 --> 03:32.791
Hey, I was just coming
to find you.

03:32.827 --> 03:35.862
Did they finally approve
my request for a therapy llama?

03:35.898 --> 03:38.197
Your position at the FBI
is under review.

03:38.233 --> 03:39.933
Hirst orchestrated your deal
and now that the Bureau

03:39.969 --> 03:41.900
knows she's dirty,
they're rethinkin' it.

03:41.936 --> 03:43.268
That doesn't sound good.

03:43.304 --> 03:44.571
Yeah.
An agent from

03:44.607 --> 03:46.672
the Office of Professional
Responsibility

03:46.708 --> 03:48.440
is in the conference room
waiting on you right now.

03:48.476 --> 03:50.275
Wh... Right now?!
I'm in pajamas.

03:50.311 --> 03:51.577
They spring it on you
like a drug test

03:51.613 --> 03:53.512
- so you can't prepare for it.
- Yeah.

03:53.548 --> 03:55.347
Except the bag of clean urine
that I definitely

03:55.383 --> 03:56.849
don't have taped
to my leg at all times

03:56.885 --> 03:58.351
wouldn't really help
in this situation.

03:58.387 --> 04:01.254
Hang on a second.
This is not a big deal, is it?

04:01.290 --> 04:03.322
Unfortunately, it is
a big deal, Rich.

04:03.358 --> 04:04.823
OPR holds a lot of
power in this building.

04:04.859 --> 04:06.625
Last time a member of our team
was under review,

04:06.661 --> 04:07.793
Jane got arrested.

04:07.829 --> 04:09.428
- Ohh...
- If you fail this review,

04:09.464 --> 04:11.430
they'll rip up your contract
and send you back to prison.

04:11.466 --> 04:13.232
But, hey, you love prison.

04:13.268 --> 04:15.500
Well, I, I mean,
I don't love prison.

04:15.536 --> 04:16.902
It really, I mean,
it depends on the place.

04:16.938 --> 04:19.738
You know, I mean, Rikers
has half-ply toilet paper.

04:19.774 --> 04:20.839
Good luck, Rich.

04:20.875 --> 04:22.741
Half a ply.

04:22.777 --> 04:24.543
Did you find more
messages on the forum?

04:24.579 --> 04:27.313
Uh, "more"
is an understatement.

04:27.349 --> 04:28.981
What forum?

04:29.017 --> 04:31.353
I cracked
the dragonfly tattoo.

04:32.553 --> 04:33.986
You see this yet?

04:34.022 --> 04:35.320
This gonna be a problem?

04:35.356 --> 04:36.856
Not if they don't find out.

04:36.892 --> 04:39.591
Well, when it comes out
and... it will,

04:39.627 --> 04:42.661
be prepared to be very
unpopular with your friends.

04:42.697 --> 04:45.998
The messages
were originally deleted

04:46.034 --> 04:47.666
after they were being read.

04:47.702 --> 04:51.337
But if you take a very deep dive
into the metadata,

04:51.373 --> 04:52.971
you find these.

04:53.007 --> 04:58.810
Messages between two users,
Dragonfly164 and Atlantic17.

04:58.846 --> 05:00.012
So what do they say?

05:00.048 --> 05:02.014
Uh, it looks like Dragonfly

05:02.050 --> 05:03.815
is involved
in a terrorist organization.

05:03.851 --> 05:06.685
He refers to some kind of attack
they're planning.

05:06.721 --> 05:07.820
What about Atlantic?

05:07.856 --> 05:10.490
Most of it is Dragonfly
reporting information to him.

05:10.526 --> 05:13.293
A few months ago,
they went silent...

05:13.329 --> 05:14.426
Until this morning.

05:14.462 --> 05:15.695
Dragonfly is
in New York now.

05:15.731 --> 05:17.430
It says they're meeting
under the bridge

05:17.466 --> 05:18.830
at Astoria park today.

05:18.866 --> 05:20.933
And if they're here,
it could be for an attack.

05:20.969 --> 05:22.067
Any idea who
these people are?

05:27.409 --> 05:29.841
- ...this is a maybe...
- You can stop looking.

05:29.877 --> 05:30.842
Why?

05:30.878 --> 05:33.282
I know who
Dragonfly164 is.

05:36.050 --> 05:38.288
It's Borden.
He's alive.

05:42.123 --> 05:44.559
How could you
possibly know that?

05:46.962 --> 05:49.065
Because Atlantic17 is me.

05:58.709 --> 06:03.448
Subtitles by explosiveskull

06:04.642 --> 06:06.364
Borden's alive?

06:06.400 --> 06:07.345
Why didn't you tell us?

06:07.381 --> 06:08.751
I couldn't.

06:11.997 --> 06:13.718
He is a CIA asset,

06:13.754 --> 06:16.083
and that is why I have been
communicating with him.

06:16.119 --> 06:17.647
I was his handler.

06:23.085 --> 06:24.686
Start from the beginning.

06:27.621 --> 06:30.392
That, uh,
night at the barn...

06:48.376 --> 06:50.782
He fully expected
the explosion to kill him,

06:50.818 --> 06:52.448
but it didn't.

07:02.623 --> 07:05.424
Between the burns
and the gunshot wound,

07:05.460 --> 07:07.096
he was in bad shape.

07:08.429 --> 07:11.097
He performed field medicine
on himself

07:11.133 --> 07:14.467
and fled the country.
The CIA didn't know

07:14.503 --> 07:16.705
he was alive
until a year later.

07:17.772 --> 07:19.404
How did you find him here?

07:19.440 --> 07:21.440
The ID he had on
him was a known alias.

07:21.476 --> 07:23.508
The hospital alerted
the Mumbai station chief.

07:23.544 --> 07:24.777
How long until
he's strong enough

07:24.813 --> 07:26.512
to be transported back
to the FBI?

07:26.548 --> 07:27.880
We're not
bringing him back.

07:27.916 --> 07:31.383
Nor are we informing
the Bureau that he's alive.

07:31.419 --> 07:32.650
We're gonna cut him
a deal.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.152
- You can't be serious.
- Mm-hmm.

07:34.188 --> 07:37.423
He's gotten dozens
of FBI agents killed, he...

07:37.459 --> 07:39.525
He plotted a nuclear attack
on D.C.

07:39.561 --> 07:41.493
And Sandstorm
is now extinct,

07:41.529 --> 07:42.727
which means Borden
is no longer

07:42.763 --> 07:45.498
of any intelligence value
to the FBI.

07:45.534 --> 07:48.868
It would be a waste
to hand him over to them

07:48.904 --> 07:50.469
when we could use him

07:50.505 --> 07:52.104
to take down someone
even worse.

07:57.512 --> 07:58.878
Goran Gorovich.

07:58.914 --> 08:01.179
He killed 100,000
of his own people

08:01.215 --> 08:02.714
through ethnic cleansing.

08:02.750 --> 08:05.150
One of the worst genocides
in modern history.

08:05.186 --> 08:07.186
And we have intel
that he's planning

08:07.222 --> 08:08.854
to attack the U.S. soon.

08:08.890 --> 08:10.623
What do you want?

08:10.659 --> 08:12.657
We want you to go undercover
with one of his cells

08:12.693 --> 08:14.460
and figure out
where Gorovich is hiding.

08:14.496 --> 08:16.494
Now, if you can locate him,

08:16.530 --> 08:17.630
we're prepared to offer you

08:17.666 --> 08:19.802
complete immunity
for your crimes.

08:24.205 --> 08:25.904
No, thank you.

08:25.940 --> 08:30.209
Look, the alternative
is gonna be a life in solitary.

08:30.245 --> 08:32.948
You get a tough jury,
lethal injection.

08:35.515 --> 08:38.484
I peeled burnt flesh

08:38.520 --> 08:40.953
off nearly
a third of my body.

08:40.989 --> 08:43.688
It took 46 hours

08:43.725 --> 08:45.458
because I kept passing out
from the pain.

08:45.494 --> 08:47.158
The last year of my life

08:47.194 --> 08:49.831
has been
an unfathomable hell.

08:53.268 --> 08:56.439
I know you wish that
I had died in that explosion.

08:57.606 --> 08:59.508
I wish I had, too.

09:00.942 --> 09:02.577
She was too good for you.

09:04.578 --> 09:07.715
Your wife, Chris.

09:12.087 --> 09:14.552
She's the one that got you to join
Doctors Without Borders, right?

09:14.588 --> 09:17.122
She'd been working with them
since medical school.

09:17.158 --> 09:20.960
You know, one of her earlier
trips was pretty traumatic.

09:20.996 --> 09:22.561
A ghost town.

09:22.597 --> 09:23.829
You know, by the time
they got there,

09:23.865 --> 09:26.098
there was no one
left to be saved.

09:26.134 --> 09:27.733
Entire village
massacred,

09:27.769 --> 09:29.567
including a school
full of children.

09:29.603 --> 09:32.204
That was Gorovich.
Listen, you say

09:32.240 --> 09:35.173
all the horrible things
you did were for your wife.

09:35.209 --> 09:37.910
If she could see
what you've become,

09:37.946 --> 09:39.849
she would be ashamed.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.248
This is the last thing
you can do

09:42.284 --> 09:44.854
that she would
actually be proud of.

09:51.058 --> 09:52.694
How would I get in?

09:53.895 --> 09:56.228
Borden went undercover
shortly after that.

09:56.264 --> 09:59.732
He hasn't gotten eyes
on Gorovich, but...

09:59.768 --> 10:03.067
he has given a lot
of good intel to the CIA.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.137
The Dragonfly
message from this morning

10:05.173 --> 10:06.272
said he's here
in New York.

10:06.308 --> 10:07.739
Why is he here?

10:07.775 --> 10:09.074
I don't know.

10:09.110 --> 10:10.609
He was given
a new handler

10:10.645 --> 10:12.744
when I came to work
on this task force.

10:12.780 --> 10:14.913
Keaton's trying to figure
out what's going on.

10:14.949 --> 10:17.815
If Borden is on U.S. soil,
then we need to arrest him.

10:17.851 --> 10:20.819
You can't do that.
If he is still undercover,

10:20.855 --> 10:22.588
you will blow
a year-long op.

10:22.624 --> 10:25.060
I have to meet with him alone.

10:26.995 --> 10:29.631
There's nothing left
to talk about then.

10:34.635 --> 10:36.569
Patterson!

10:36.605 --> 10:39.008
I am so sorry!

10:42.910 --> 10:44.142
You have no idea

10:44.178 --> 10:47.245
how hard it was for me
to keep that from you.

10:47.281 --> 10:50.181
How hard it was for you?!

10:50.217 --> 10:52.283
I can still feel
his hands on me

10:52.319 --> 10:55.186
when I try to fall asleep
at night.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.723
Because before
he beat me, shot me,

10:57.759 --> 11:00.124
and put a tracking device
in me,

11:00.160 --> 11:02.661
he used to sleep in my bed.

11:02.697 --> 11:04.796
- I know...
- All this time, you knew

11:04.832 --> 11:07.333
he was still out there
and you said nothing.

11:07.369 --> 11:09.902
I was trying
to protect you.

11:09.938 --> 11:11.936
I thought
it would be better

11:11.972 --> 11:14.339
if you never knew
he was alive.

11:14.375 --> 11:17.910
It tormented me that
he died on his own terms!

11:17.946 --> 11:20.679
All I wanted was
to put him in prison,

11:20.715 --> 11:22.781
to take back
a fraction of the control

11:22.817 --> 11:24.682
that he took away
from me!

11:24.718 --> 11:26.719
You got a second chance

11:26.755 --> 11:28.686
and you should have
given me that.

11:28.722 --> 11:30.858
But instead,
you chose to work with him.

11:31.992 --> 11:35.129
I had to.
It is my job.

11:36.997 --> 11:39.330
You're my best friend.

11:39.366 --> 11:42.734
Whatever it would've cost you
to say no,

11:42.770 --> 11:45.039
you should have
cared about me more.

11:51.246 --> 11:54.616
We'll be by tomorrow to start
prepping you on your targets.

11:58.419 --> 12:00.823
How, how's,
how's Patterson?

12:05.125 --> 12:06.959
Ahh!

12:06.995 --> 12:10.295
Don't ever say
her name again.

12:20.275 --> 12:22.273
Mr. Dotcom...

12:22.309 --> 12:24.142
- Millicent Van Der Waal.
- Okay.

12:24.178 --> 12:25.911
I've been looking forward
to this review.

12:25.947 --> 12:27.850
- Great.
- Oh, please.

12:28.750 --> 12:29.848
I've heard tales.

12:29.884 --> 12:31.282
Oh, people love
to exaggerate,

12:31.318 --> 12:32.750
you know...
believe everything you hear.

12:32.786 --> 12:34.219
As you know,

12:34.255 --> 12:36.254
you're being investigated
because you were hired

12:36.290 --> 12:38.423
by the traitor,
Eleanor Hirst.

12:38.459 --> 12:40.158
- Horrible woman.
- Mm...

12:40.194 --> 12:42.261
'Course I didn't know anything
about what she was really doing.

12:42.297 --> 12:44.430
She offered me a way
out of prison, I said yes.

12:44.466 --> 12:45.797
That's all I know.

12:45.833 --> 12:46.998
Well, let that be
a lesson:

12:47.034 --> 12:49.200
Never trust a woman
with a short haircut.

12:49.236 --> 12:51.302
Sure...

12:51.338 --> 12:52.771
Yeah, that's wise.

12:52.807 --> 12:54.239
Why don't you tell me
a little bit

12:54.275 --> 12:56.307
about the day
Hirst was arrested?

12:56.343 --> 12:58.076
From my understanding,
she asked you

12:58.112 --> 12:59.878
to help her frame
her fellow agents.

12:59.914 --> 13:01.913
She did,
but I didn't.

13:01.949 --> 13:03.181
I told the team what
she was doing

13:03.217 --> 13:04.916
and I even got Patterson
out of the building

13:04.952 --> 13:06.384
after Hirst
locked it down, so...

13:06.420 --> 13:07.719
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:07.755 --> 13:09.991
And how exactly
did you manage that?

13:11.826 --> 13:13.358
Just, uh, you know,
any Joe Sixpack

13:13.394 --> 13:14.926
could have done it,
I think.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.494
I got lucky is what it is.
I mean, I don't wanna

13:16.530 --> 13:18.062
bore you with
the details of my...

13:18.098 --> 13:18.931
Hmm.

13:18.967 --> 13:21.800
See, the thing is,
the boring details are

13:21.836 --> 13:24.302
the only way I could confirm
that your story is true.

13:24.338 --> 13:28.507
I have to warn you that lying
to me is not advisable.

13:28.543 --> 13:30.041
I'm not lying.
Okay, I mean,

13:30.077 --> 13:31.509
do you wanna know
how I did it?

13:31.545 --> 13:33.144
- I can tell you how I did it, sure.
- Great.

13:33.180 --> 13:35.980
First I used Patterson's
computer login to hack into

13:36.016 --> 13:37.883
the FBI security system
and download a virus.

13:37.919 --> 13:40.051
- Hey, how do you know my login?
- Please.

13:40.087 --> 13:42.019
Then I let her into
my tunnels and, uh...

13:42.055 --> 13:42.854
Your tunnels?

13:42.890 --> 13:45.224
Well, our...
our tunnels, you know.

13:45.260 --> 13:46.791
Just the vents
in the building.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.026
Then there was
the delivery man

13:48.062 --> 13:49.360
that I stuffed
into a locker,

13:49.396 --> 13:50.796
and, of course,
the bomb threat.

13:50.832 --> 13:52.964
Get out! Now!
It's a fake!

13:53.000 --> 13:54.233
You know what?
Come to think of it,

13:54.269 --> 13:55.533
if I hadn't gotten Patterson
out of the building,

13:55.569 --> 13:57.136
then Hirst would've
never been arrested.

13:57.172 --> 13:59.003
So, as I see it, I'm due
some sort of commendation.

13:59.039 --> 14:01.142
Are you with the department
that approves therapy animals?

14:04.212 --> 14:05.477
Whatcha writing there?

14:05.513 --> 14:07.879
Just tallying
how many years

14:07.915 --> 14:09.882
you've tacked onto
your prison sentence

14:09.918 --> 14:11.953
based on
that story alone.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.387
Now, tell me more
about the virus.

14:15.423 --> 14:18.157
I... I don't,
I don't want to.

14:18.193 --> 14:20.191
Although I'm not thrilled
that Agent Zapata

14:20.227 --> 14:21.493
leaked classified intel,

14:21.529 --> 14:22.994
this case has become
too pressing

14:23.030 --> 14:24.863
to worry about
interagency clearances.

14:24.899 --> 14:26.230
Pressing how?

14:26.266 --> 14:29.000
Borden's handler was
a field agent named Conover.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.168
I reached out to him
this morning

14:30.204 --> 14:32.537
to find out why
the asset is stateside,

14:32.573 --> 14:34.272
but I couldn't get in contact
with him.

14:34.308 --> 14:35.407
He's missing?

14:35.443 --> 14:37.843
Was missing.
A body was found

14:37.879 --> 14:40.412
in a dumpster
just outside Belgrade.

14:40.448 --> 14:42.147
It's Conover.

14:42.183 --> 14:43.849
We were able to find
security footage

14:43.885 --> 14:45.917
from a camera near
the spot he was left.

14:45.953 --> 14:49.120
It's Borden.
He killed his handler.

14:49.156 --> 14:52.224
It seems that way.
He's most likely turned.

14:52.260 --> 14:54.125
Of course he's turned.
He's a terrorist.

14:54.161 --> 14:56.228
You should never have
trusted him in the first place.

14:56.264 --> 14:58.564
I came here today
to give you a friendly tip

14:58.600 --> 15:00.298
that the known terrorist
Nigel Thornton,

15:00.334 --> 15:03.902
AKA Robert Borden, will be
in Astoria Park at noon.

15:03.938 --> 15:05.970
Whatever you choose to do
with this information

15:06.006 --> 15:08.105
is none
of my business.

15:08.141 --> 15:09.544
Wait... look.

15:10.879 --> 15:13.011
He is looking
right into the camera.

15:13.047 --> 15:14.883
He wanted us to find him!

15:18.919 --> 15:20.352
Zapata's right.

15:20.388 --> 15:23.589
That's the only
security camera for ten miles.

15:23.625 --> 15:25.923
It's pretty odd that
they just happened

15:25.959 --> 15:27.892
to dump a body there,
unless Borden...

15:27.928 --> 15:29.964
chose that
spot intentionally.

15:33.101 --> 15:34.333
All right,
we give him one chance

15:34.369 --> 15:35.600
to prove he hasn't turned.

15:35.636 --> 15:37.335
Zapata will go to the meet,
with backup.

15:37.371 --> 15:39.238
But if anyone gets
so much as a bad feeling,

15:39.274 --> 15:41.109
we abort, all right?

15:52.953 --> 15:54.353
<i>It's 12:01.</i>

15:54.389 --> 15:55.957
Any minute now.

16:02.263 --> 16:05.296
All right, here he comes
down the hill headed west.

16:05.332 --> 16:06.968
It's really him.

16:07.935 --> 16:09.871
Two guys coming your way.

16:15.009 --> 16:17.375
- They've drawn their weapons.
- It's a trap!

16:17.411 --> 16:19.444
Oh, Zapata,
get down now.

16:19.480 --> 16:21.650
Everybody get down!
FBI!

16:25.019 --> 16:27.022
Weller!
Borden's heading your way!

16:35.163 --> 16:37.396
Stay down.

16:37.432 --> 16:38.997
What are you doing here?

16:39.033 --> 16:41.032
Something I should've done
the day you walked in the FBI.

16:41.068 --> 16:44.305
Nigel Thornton,
you're under arrest.

16:46.984 --> 16:48.317
Come on, Nigel.

16:48.353 --> 16:49.718
We know that
you killed your handler

16:49.754 --> 16:50.885
and joined Gorovich.

16:50.921 --> 16:52.654
Why did you lure me
to the park?

16:52.690 --> 16:54.023
I didn't lure you there.

16:54.059 --> 16:55.857
I didn't know those guys
were gonna show up.

16:55.893 --> 16:57.392
You're not as good a liar
as you used to be.

16:57.428 --> 17:00.796
They weren't coming after you.
They were coming after me.

17:00.832 --> 17:03.766
They figured out
I was working for you.

17:03.802 --> 17:06.738
We have you on camera disposing
of your handler's body.

17:07.734 --> 17:09.771
I know.

17:09.807 --> 17:11.339
The cell was working
on a new attack,

17:11.375 --> 17:12.942
something really big.

17:12.978 --> 17:15.711
But they were suspicious
that they had a mole.

17:15.747 --> 17:17.113
One day I got back
to the compound

17:17.148 --> 17:18.279
and Conover was there.

17:18.315 --> 17:20.249
He'd been caught tailing
one of them.

17:20.285 --> 17:22.385
You killed him so he wouldn't
blow your cover?

17:22.421 --> 17:23.984
No.

17:24.021 --> 17:25.825
I put him out
of his misery.

17:27.258 --> 17:29.661
One of my roles
for the cell...

17:31.729 --> 17:35.865
...was keeping prisoners alive
while they tortured them.

17:35.901 --> 17:37.298
Go again.

17:39.970 --> 17:41.871
It turns out
I have a real knack

17:41.907 --> 17:44.306
for finding that sweet spot

17:44.342 --> 17:47.179
right on the cusp
between life and death.

17:48.479 --> 17:50.913
So, you were supposed to
keep Conover alive,

17:50.949 --> 17:54.150
but instead you
let them kill him quickly.

17:54.186 --> 17:55.384
I told them it was
a mistake.

17:55.420 --> 17:57.219
He must've had
a heart condition.

17:57.255 --> 18:01.990
But I knew.
They were onto me.

18:02.026 --> 18:04.426
When you brought me in,
you found a USB in my jacket.

18:04.462 --> 18:06.261
It contains
a copy of every file

18:06.297 --> 18:07.762
from the compound's
only computer.

18:07.798 --> 18:08.897
I downloaded it
that night,

18:08.933 --> 18:10.398
then I got the hell
out of there.

18:10.434 --> 18:12.801
Why didn't you send out
the Dragonfly SOS immediately?

18:12.837 --> 18:15.971
<i>Using the message board with the
cell after me was too dangerous.</i>

18:16.007 --> 18:18.039
Hey...

18:18.075 --> 18:19.709
How are you?

18:19.745 --> 18:21.447
I'm not sure.

18:22.948 --> 18:26.848
I've moved apartments seven
times in the last two years

18:26.884 --> 18:29.417
trying to find one
where I felt safe.

18:29.453 --> 18:31.753
I kept telling myself,

18:31.789 --> 18:34.056
"There's no reason
to be afraid.

18:34.092 --> 18:36.058
Borden is dead."

18:36.094 --> 18:38.327
You know you can sit
this one out if you want.

18:38.363 --> 18:40.362
- We can handle it.
- I know.

18:40.398 --> 18:43.499
But if there's a chance
to bring down Gorovich,

18:43.535 --> 18:45.366
then I have to stay.

18:45.402 --> 18:47.936
<i>We'll analyze
the contents of the USB.</i>

18:47.972 --> 18:49.805
<i>If the intel checks out,</i>

18:49.841 --> 18:51.807
we'll talk again.

18:51.843 --> 18:53.946
Wait, there's something else.

18:55.380 --> 18:57.216
I want to see
Agent Patterson.

18:59.450 --> 19:01.884
<i>There's... there's not
a lot that keeps me up</i>

19:01.920 --> 19:04.052
at night anymore.

19:04.088 --> 19:08.490
But what I did
to Patterson, it...

19:08.526 --> 19:11.229
There are things
I need to say to her.

19:15.400 --> 19:19.905
It is not her responsibility
to help you sleep at night.

19:29.046 --> 19:32.147
Kurt's right, you don't
owe him anything.

19:32.183 --> 19:33.782
Crime scene technicians
recovered a phone

19:33.818 --> 19:35.183
from one of the terrorists'
dead bodies.

19:35.219 --> 19:37.419
He received a kill order
for Borden, not Zapata.

19:37.455 --> 19:38.820
He's telling the truth.

19:38.856 --> 19:40.289
Looks like it.
The order also said

19:40.325 --> 19:42.857
get him out of the way
before tomorrow's attack.

19:42.893 --> 19:43.959
So we only have one day

19:43.995 --> 19:45.498
to figure out their plan
and stop it.

19:48.033 --> 19:50.165
This way, there will only be
one access point.

19:50.201 --> 19:51.901
That's excellent.

19:51.937 --> 19:54.135
Sir, if you don't mind
my asking...

19:54.171 --> 19:55.871
- Mm-hmm.
- We both know you've gone

19:55.907 --> 19:57.906
to some pretty extreme lengths
to get this land.

19:57.942 --> 20:00.308
Why is it
so important to you?

20:00.344 --> 20:05.548
When you see the world
as it looks from space,

20:05.584 --> 20:07.148
what's missing?

20:07.184 --> 20:11.153
All of these arbitrary
little lines...

20:11.189 --> 20:13.254
borders, drawn across
the world

20:13.290 --> 20:15.391
with no concern
for the good of its people.

20:15.427 --> 20:19.427
This land is part of my plan
for a new global society,

20:19.463 --> 20:23.132
one rooted in reason
and not in folly.

20:23.168 --> 20:27.169
I've served other leaders
who wanted to change the world.

20:27.205 --> 20:29.471
But in the end,
they were no different

20:29.507 --> 20:31.307
than the men and women
they were replacing.

20:31.343 --> 20:32.575
Exactly.

20:32.611 --> 20:35.411
Our mistake is thinking that
the "right" leaders

20:35.447 --> 20:36.979
will bring peace
to the world

20:37.015 --> 20:39.914
when in all of human history
we've never come close.

20:39.950 --> 20:41.616
I'm not sure I understand.

20:41.652 --> 20:43.318
All right, well,
then two kids,

20:43.354 --> 20:47.189
they get into a fistfight
in the schoolyard.

20:47.225 --> 20:48.891
And if there's
other kids around,

20:48.927 --> 20:52.027
maybe they choose sides,
but they don't stop the fight.

20:52.063 --> 20:56.065
The only one who stops
the fight is the teacher.

20:56.101 --> 20:59.100
Now, in the modern world,
there is no teacher.

20:59.136 --> 21:01.002
We need one.

21:01.038 --> 21:02.270
Who the hell is
the teacher?

21:02.306 --> 21:06.942
50 million soldiers with
a budget of $5 trillion.

21:06.978 --> 21:09.478
Highly paid
military contractors

21:09.514 --> 21:12.414
who don't serve country
or cause.

21:12.450 --> 21:15.984
Their sole directive would be
to prevent violence.

21:16.020 --> 21:17.353
A peacekeeping force
greater than

21:17.389 --> 21:20.588
all the world's militaries
combined.

21:20.624 --> 21:21.990
It would be
the end of war.

21:22.026 --> 21:24.326
- That's the idea.
- But where do you get

21:24.362 --> 21:26.228
that many people with
no loyalty to any country?

21:26.264 --> 21:29.464
For now, that's where
the land comes in.

21:31.102 --> 21:33.873
Tom? Tom?
Are you okay?

21:35.539 --> 21:38.039
Diane? Diane, quick!
Call an ambulance!

21:38.075 --> 21:39.540
Let's move on to
the next topic:

21:39.576 --> 21:41.010
- Your patriotism.
- Great.

21:41.046 --> 21:42.610
- God bless America, huh?
- Have you ever used

21:42.646 --> 21:44.946
the American flag in
an act of fornication

21:44.982 --> 21:46.985
known as
"Betsy Ross' Revenge"?

21:48.553 --> 21:50.051
You obviously know
that I have,

21:50.087 --> 21:51.487
because you obviously
know that I applied

21:51.523 --> 21:53.923
to have that name trademarked
the very next day.

21:53.959 --> 21:55.628
- It was denied.
- I know it was denied.

21:56.527 --> 21:57.992
This isn't about Hirst.

21:58.028 --> 21:59.295
This isn't even about
my job performance.

21:59.331 --> 22:01.129
This is about
how I don't conform

22:01.165 --> 22:03.331
to your old-fashioned ideas
about who should

22:03.367 --> 22:06.067
and shouldn't be working
for the government.

22:06.103 --> 22:07.536
- You're right.
- Ahh...

22:07.572 --> 22:09.070
You have no respect
for this office.

22:09.106 --> 22:10.172
You have
no decorum and,

22:10.208 --> 22:12.007
as far as I can tell,
no morals.

22:12.043 --> 22:13.174
That's why
I'll be recommending

22:13.210 --> 22:14.442
that your contract
be terminated.

22:14.478 --> 22:15.944
Wait, hang on,

22:15.980 --> 22:17.279
you're just gonna
send me back to prison?

22:17.315 --> 22:18.981
Okay, look,
what you just said

22:19.017 --> 22:21.083
might have been true
and entirely flattering

22:21.119 --> 22:23.152
when I got here,
but this place has changed me.

22:23.188 --> 22:26.020
I care about the work,
and I care about the people.

22:26.056 --> 22:28.289
It's not about what
your country can do for you,

22:28.325 --> 22:30.491
it's about what you can do
for your country.

22:30.527 --> 22:34.933
And you haven't done enough
to warrant a position here.

22:38.670 --> 22:40.702
What are you,
quoting JFK at me?

22:40.738 --> 22:43.338
He was sluttier than I am!

22:43.374 --> 22:46.442
Only one Gorovich assassin
survived the firefight

22:46.478 --> 22:47.742
- in the park.
- Mihael.

22:47.778 --> 22:49.010
He was a foot soldier
in the same cell

22:49.046 --> 22:50.212
Borden was embedded in.

22:50.248 --> 22:52.047
Unfortunately,
he's still in surgery.

22:52.083 --> 22:54.115
Right now the only thing we have
to go on is the USB.

22:54.151 --> 22:55.416
Which is basically useless.

22:55.452 --> 22:57.618
Looks like the USB
was damaged in transit.

22:57.654 --> 23:00.055
The files from the computer
are completely corrupted,

23:00.091 --> 23:01.456
just pages and pages
of nonsense.

23:01.492 --> 23:03.692
So these guys are planning
an attack for tomorrow

23:03.728 --> 23:05.626
and we have no idea where?

23:05.662 --> 23:07.967
And no way to stop it.

23:10.768 --> 23:12.201
For too long,
the United States

23:12.237 --> 23:14.336
has deemed itself
the world's police

23:14.372 --> 23:17.573
and interfered with matters
that does not concern them.

23:17.609 --> 23:20.209
And it's time
to turn the tables.

23:20.245 --> 23:23.382
By the time you are
seeing this, that island...

23:25.182 --> 23:28.219
...will be nothing more
than a mass grave.

23:35.368 --> 23:38.189
Mihael the assassin
is out of surgery.

23:38.225 --> 23:40.099
He's in bad shape.
They gave him heavy meds.

23:40.135 --> 23:41.216
He has no idea
where he is.

23:41.252 --> 23:43.592
That's not ideal
for interrogation.

23:43.628 --> 23:45.227
Or maybe it's perfect.

23:45.263 --> 23:48.355
The CIA does intentional
drugged interrogation

23:48.391 --> 23:49.531
all the time.

23:49.567 --> 23:51.166
If Mihael is already
disoriented,

23:51.202 --> 23:52.635
he is highly suggestible.

23:52.671 --> 23:54.771
So instead of telling him
we are Feds,

23:54.807 --> 23:56.606
we can pretend
to be co-conspirators.

23:56.642 --> 23:58.812
Talk to him about
our attack plan.

24:01.113 --> 24:02.715
You should bring Borden.

24:04.517 --> 24:06.483
He's a familiar face
to Mihael.

24:06.519 --> 24:08.855
They worked together.
It'll help sell the lie.

24:26.704 --> 24:28.671
Mr. Jakeman,
please sit back down.

24:28.707 --> 24:30.106
It's all right, Tom.

24:30.142 --> 24:31.840
You're at a hospital.
You passed out.

24:31.876 --> 24:32.876
I'm fine.

24:32.912 --> 24:35.712
I'm sure you
are, but just to be safe,

24:35.748 --> 24:36.913
I've asked
these fine doctors

24:36.949 --> 24:38.580
to run a complete battery
of tests.

24:38.616 --> 24:39.616
Look, that's really
not necessary.

24:39.652 --> 24:40.849
If this is a...

24:40.885 --> 24:42.284
a liability issue
for your company,

24:42.320 --> 24:43.852
I'll sign a waiver...

24:43.888 --> 24:45.621
No, this is not...

24:45.657 --> 24:46.955
This is not about
liability, son.

24:46.991 --> 24:48.023
Why don't you sit down?

24:48.059 --> 24:50.092
Come on, sit down.

24:50.128 --> 24:52.194
I'm worried about you.

24:52.230 --> 24:54.196
I wanna make sure
you're all right.

24:54.232 --> 24:55.934
Where do we begin,
Doctor?

25:03.208 --> 25:05.541
Mihael.

25:05.577 --> 25:07.743
<i>Mihael, it's, it's me,
it's Nigel.</i>

25:07.779 --> 25:10.046
<i>It's okay, I just finished
stitching you up.</i>

25:10.082 --> 25:11.281
What happened?

25:11.317 --> 25:13.649
There was a miscommunication.

25:13.685 --> 25:15.551
The guy wasn't where
he was supposed to be.

25:15.587 --> 25:18.120
<i>I was never
any good at reading.</i>

25:18.156 --> 25:20.822
<i>Listen, I'm supposed to
take you back to the compound.</i>

25:20.858 --> 25:22.157
Do you know how
to get there?

25:22.193 --> 25:23.626
I liked the story about

25:23.662 --> 25:27.096
the scorpion
and the frog, but...

25:27.132 --> 25:29.131
I never knew
how it ended.

25:29.167 --> 25:31.833
Mihael, this is important.

25:31.869 --> 25:34.072
Gorovich needs us
for the attack tomorrow.

25:36.141 --> 25:38.640
You.

25:38.676 --> 25:40.143
You were the traitor.

25:40.179 --> 25:42.278
No, no, you're disoriented,
Mihael.

25:42.314 --> 25:43.612
<i>I'll kill you!</i>

25:43.648 --> 25:45.317
This isn't working.

25:46.317 --> 25:47.282
If you want answers,

25:47.318 --> 25:49.051
<i>you should take him
off the opiates.</i>

25:49.087 --> 25:51.087
<i>The pain from
his lacerated liver</i>

25:51.123 --> 25:52.625
<i>will open him right up.</i>

25:53.692 --> 25:54.656
Think of the asset
she could be,

25:54.692 --> 25:56.024
the intel she can provide.

25:56.060 --> 25:58.627
Ahh!

25:58.663 --> 25:59.695
We can lower the dosage...

25:59.731 --> 26:01.931
We are not torturing him.

26:01.967 --> 26:03.970
It's over, we failed.

26:09.208 --> 26:11.006
Get out!

26:11.042 --> 26:12.844
Now, everyone, go!

26:18.817 --> 26:20.817
Hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey!

26:20.853 --> 26:22.952
What did that microscope
ever do to you?

26:22.988 --> 26:24.757
Oh, not now, Rich!

26:27.393 --> 26:28.957
I really,
I really just thought

26:28.993 --> 26:31.327
that if we could stop
this attack,

26:31.363 --> 26:33.963
there would be some
purpose to all this.

26:33.999 --> 26:37.804
To what Borden did to me,
and now Zapata...

26:39.672 --> 26:41.971
I really don't think
we're gonna stop this one.

26:42.007 --> 26:44.107
We're failing,
and I can't...

26:44.143 --> 26:46.746
I can't think
of anything else to do.

26:49.048 --> 26:50.679
Would you come with me?

26:50.715 --> 26:52.682
I wanna show you
something.

26:52.718 --> 26:54.951
Doors definitely don't work
with the sensors.

26:57.122 --> 26:58.154
Tah-dah!

26:58.190 --> 26:59.722
I didn't even know
this was here.

26:59.758 --> 27:00.889
Oh, barely anybody does.

27:00.925 --> 27:02.724
That's what makes it
so magical.

27:02.760 --> 27:04.894
That's, uh, where Jim steals
his 3:00 p.m. naps.

27:04.930 --> 27:06.963
That's Briana's
crying corner.

27:06.999 --> 27:08.865
It's like the Room
of Requirement.

27:08.901 --> 27:10.133
Why are we here, Rich?

27:10.169 --> 27:13.168
Because the thing that
you require is a game

27:13.204 --> 27:17.644
in which two adults engage
in combat with giant Q-tips.

27:19.111 --> 27:20.409
Supposed to catch it.

27:20.445 --> 27:22.377
- Come on, it'll be fun.
- I'm not in the mood.

27:22.413 --> 27:24.280
I know, that's the point.

27:24.316 --> 27:25.418
Ow!

27:27.051 --> 27:28.788
Come on.

27:30.088 --> 27:32.021
Ohh!

27:32.057 --> 27:34.290
All right.

27:36.394 --> 27:38.727
Not in the mood.

27:42.334 --> 27:44.300
- Oh, no!
- Oh!

27:44.336 --> 27:45.435
You fell in the river.

27:45.471 --> 27:46.903
That's what I call that side

27:46.939 --> 27:48.704
because I spilled
blue Gatorade on there once.

27:48.740 --> 27:50.940
Best two out of three?
Whoo!

27:50.976 --> 27:51.840
The river...

27:51.876 --> 27:54.176
That's how the Scorpion
and the Frog ends.

27:54.212 --> 27:55.912
Are you talking
to somebody on your coms?

27:55.948 --> 27:57.480
Borden told Mihael
that there was

27:57.516 --> 27:59.448
a miscommunication
in the cell.

27:59.484 --> 28:01.783
And Mihael's said
that he couldn't read.

28:01.819 --> 28:03.886
We should have taken that
at face value.

28:03.922 --> 28:06.054
What if the corrupted files
aren't corrupted at all?

28:06.090 --> 28:07.490
They're just made
to look that way

28:07.526 --> 28:09.425
to someone who doesn't know
the code!

28:09.461 --> 28:11.793
- Which you definitely do.
- In the fable,

28:11.829 --> 28:14.196
what does the scorpion
say to the frog

28:14.232 --> 28:16.765
at the end
after he stung him?

28:16.801 --> 28:18.737
"I can't help it,
it's in my nature."

28:19.971 --> 28:22.841
Thank you for
the Room of Requirement.

28:26.912 --> 28:28.176
When you're looking
at these documents,

28:28.212 --> 28:30.946
they're indistinguishable
from any corrupted file.

28:30.982 --> 28:33.483
It's an impressively complex
way of encoding.

28:33.519 --> 28:35.050
To crack it,

28:35.086 --> 28:37.119
you get rid of the symbols...
they're just noise.

28:37.155 --> 28:40.756
And the letters you're left with
are the message,

28:40.792 --> 28:43.091
but they're encoded
in a Playfair cipher.

28:43.127 --> 28:46.128
In this case,
the key phrase is...

28:46.164 --> 28:48.968
"I can't help it;
it's in my nature."

28:49.999 --> 28:50.899
So, you drop
every repeating letter,

28:50.935 --> 28:53.836
and those go into
a five-by-five grid

28:53.872 --> 28:55.838
with the rest
of the alphabet.

28:55.874 --> 28:57.240
Then, whatever the message is,

28:57.276 --> 29:00.041
you translate it
in letter pairs using the grid.

29:00.077 --> 29:01.810
Did the USB say anything
about the attack,

29:01.846 --> 29:02.878
or where Gorovich is?

29:02.914 --> 29:03.980
Both, actually.

29:04.016 --> 29:05.214
Looks like
he couldn't resist

29:05.250 --> 29:06.848
a front-row seat
for his big attack.

29:06.884 --> 29:08.317
So, he's on U.S. soil?

29:08.353 --> 29:11.052
He has a cell living in
an old fort on Staten Island.

29:11.088 --> 29:13.121
He smuggled himself
on a cargo ship

29:13.157 --> 29:14.857
just a few weeks ago
to join them.

29:14.893 --> 29:17.292
His cell has
crop-dusting planes

29:17.328 --> 29:19.829
that they've outfitted
to carry these:

29:19.865 --> 29:21.464
Bunker busters...

29:21.500 --> 29:22.865
Those are
military-grade bombs

29:22.901 --> 29:24.399
used to blow up
underground targets.

29:24.435 --> 29:27.069
Just one of those things
could collapse a city block.

29:27.105 --> 29:29.338
Gorovich has 20 of them.
And he's planning

29:29.374 --> 29:32.441
on dropping them tomorrow
on five major cities.

29:32.477 --> 29:35.047
We have to take him down.
Tonight.

29:38.637 --> 29:39.272
There was nothing

29:39.308 --> 29:41.837
especially conclusive
in your test results.

29:41.873 --> 29:46.942
Your blood test was flagged
for an unusual result...

29:46.978 --> 29:49.110
Zeta Interacting
Protein.

29:49.146 --> 29:50.946
Are you familiar?

29:50.982 --> 29:52.446
<i>Got the chance
to start over again...</i>

29:52.482 --> 29:54.116
<i>and now you will too.</i>

29:55.419 --> 29:57.686
ZIP, um...

29:57.722 --> 29:58.954
Yeah, uh...

29:58.990 --> 30:02.757
I had pretty bad PTSD
after I was in combat.

30:02.793 --> 30:06.128
A psychiatrist
tried treating me with ZIP.

30:06.164 --> 30:07.661
Understood.

30:07.697 --> 30:10.634
Well, I'll be back shortly
with your discharge papers.

30:13.805 --> 30:16.638
Sorry, you didn't need
to know about my PTSD.

30:16.674 --> 30:18.773
Don't be ashamed
of your demons.

30:18.809 --> 30:19.975
We all have them.

30:20.011 --> 30:21.109
I don't know,

30:21.145 --> 30:23.145
you seem pretty
unencumbered yourself.

30:23.181 --> 30:24.812
I grew up in a house

30:24.848 --> 30:26.982
where my stepfather beat
my mother every day.

30:27.018 --> 30:29.417
I worked my ass off
to get out of there...

30:29.453 --> 30:32.052
went to Princeton,
where I met Blake's mom.

30:32.088 --> 30:34.089
We started
a business together.

30:34.125 --> 30:36.158
Life was damn near
perfect.

30:36.194 --> 30:37.692
But...

30:37.728 --> 30:42.563
I had this deep anger...
at my stepfather,

30:42.599 --> 30:43.732
at my mother
for marrying him,

30:43.768 --> 30:48.169
at myself...
for not stopping it.

30:48.205 --> 30:49.905
And it was
eating away at me.

30:49.941 --> 30:55.110
And I can see that it's
eating away at you too, Tom.

30:55.146 --> 30:56.878
And I'm guessing

30:56.914 --> 30:59.917
that it goes back
a lot farther than the war?

31:03.553 --> 31:06.554
I grew up in
a military family.

31:06.590 --> 31:09.090
There was no love, really,
only loyalty.

31:09.126 --> 31:11.193
My mother was obsessed
with loyalty.

31:11.229 --> 31:13.899
She wanted us to compete
for her affections.

31:15.500 --> 31:18.199
I was loyal.

31:18.235 --> 31:20.472
In the end, I was
the only one who was.

31:22.205 --> 31:24.805
They abandoned
me anyway.

31:24.841 --> 31:27.575
Can I give you
some advice?

31:27.611 --> 31:29.513
Let go of that anger.

31:31.214 --> 31:32.813
I'm not sure I can do that.

31:32.849 --> 31:34.783
Because you think that
that anger is what drives you.

31:34.819 --> 31:39.154
No. Anger makes
a terrible fuel.

31:39.190 --> 31:41.689
It can't help you
build anything.

31:41.725 --> 31:44.225
It can only
help you destroy.

31:44.261 --> 31:47.228
You were dealt
a bad hand

31:47.264 --> 31:49.965
in this life,
just like I was.

31:50.001 --> 31:53.667
So, fold that hand.

31:53.703 --> 31:56.007
Start over with
a new one.

31:57.875 --> 32:00.108
The fort is structured
like a bull's-eye,

32:00.144 --> 32:03.244
so it's safe to assume Gorovich
resides near the center

32:03.280 --> 32:05.280
so that any intruders
have to breach through

32:05.316 --> 32:07.048
several layers of security
to get to him.

32:07.084 --> 32:09.751
Yeah, the exterior should be
exclusively armed guards,

32:09.787 --> 32:11.652
but beyond that
it's a bit of a minefield.

32:11.688 --> 32:13.120
They're stationed there
long-term,

32:13.156 --> 32:15.756
so their wives and children
live with them at the compound.

32:15.792 --> 32:16.957
We'll go in quietly.

32:16.993 --> 32:18.627
The further
we get into that fort

32:18.663 --> 32:20.227
without alerting Gorovich,
the better.

32:20.263 --> 32:21.996
Use hand-to-hand combat
whenever possible.

32:22.032 --> 32:24.869
No one fires their weapons
unless absolutely necessary.

33:02.607 --> 33:05.005
We're not here
to hurt you.

33:05.041 --> 33:07.545
We just want Gorovich.

33:13.751 --> 33:16.584
Do you know where
the bombs are kept?

33:16.620 --> 33:17.851
I can show you.

33:17.887 --> 33:20.854
Jane, Tasha, you go with her,
secure the weapon.

33:20.890 --> 33:22.960
Reade, let's go
get Gorovich.

33:56.726 --> 33:58.597
Why isn't anyone
guarding these weapons?

34:00.031 --> 34:02.000
Because they're rigged
to explode.

34:04.100 --> 34:06.033
If that goes off,
this entire fort becomes

34:06.069 --> 34:07.401
a crater in the ground.

34:30.025 --> 34:31.391
<i>Gorovich has a
dead man's switch.</i>

34:31.428 --> 34:33.260
Do not engage!
I repeat, do not engage!

34:33.295 --> 34:34.396
Step back...

34:34.431 --> 34:38.065
Or I remove my finger
and we all die.

34:38.101 --> 34:39.266
He's already with him.

34:39.303 --> 34:41.302
Kurt, we're gonna try
to disarm it,

34:41.338 --> 34:42.771
<i>but I need you to stall.</i>

34:42.806 --> 34:45.039
We need to remove
the blasting caps from the C4.

34:45.074 --> 34:46.810
Careful, fast as you can.

34:51.447 --> 34:54.149
All right, you
hold all the cards here.

34:54.185 --> 34:55.282
What do you want?

34:55.318 --> 34:56.751
You let me go.

34:56.786 --> 34:59.454
We can get the Director
of the CIA on the phone.

34:59.490 --> 35:01.423
He might be willing to
release you to the Serbians.

35:01.459 --> 35:02.756
No.

35:02.792 --> 35:04.358
You tell your army
to stand down

35:04.394 --> 35:05.794
and let me walk out
of here, now!

35:05.830 --> 35:08.329
- Now, get back!
- Whoa, easy.

35:08.365 --> 35:11.265
- We can do that, can't we?
- Yes.

35:11.301 --> 35:12.767
We can do that.

35:12.803 --> 35:15.135
We'll let you walk out
of here, sir...

35:15.171 --> 35:17.207
but you have to
hand over that detonator.

35:19.477 --> 35:21.843
Do you know what
the best part

35:21.879 --> 35:24.778
about having a bomb is?

35:24.814 --> 35:26.948
There are no
negotiations.

35:26.984 --> 35:29.050
Sir... No!

35:29.086 --> 35:30.821
No!

35:38.095 --> 35:39.827
Jane and Zapata,
you guys okay?

35:39.863 --> 35:41.995
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, we're good.

35:42.031 --> 35:43.430
We've secured
the bunker busters.

35:43.466 --> 35:44.865
<i>That's good.</i>

35:44.901 --> 35:47.838
Means we got Gorovich.
It's over.

35:53.446 --> 35:55.512
I helped you
to get Gorovich

35:55.548 --> 35:57.514
and you throw me
to the wolves?

35:57.550 --> 35:58.849
If you're looking
for an apology,

35:58.885 --> 36:00.653
you're not gonna get it.

36:01.620 --> 36:03.419
I have worked
for so many people.

36:03.455 --> 36:05.488
People I thought
I could trust.

36:05.524 --> 36:09.559
And in the end, they all
turned their back on me.

36:09.595 --> 36:13.533
Well, working for the CIA
won't be any different for you!

36:14.700 --> 36:16.966
At least let me talk
to Patterson!

36:17.002 --> 36:18.869
Zapata killed his deal.

36:18.905 --> 36:20.903
He's going away
for life.

36:20.939 --> 36:23.474
<i>I know you're there!</i>

36:23.510 --> 36:26.744
<i>Patterson, please,
I need to see you!</i>

36:26.780 --> 36:28.778
Are you sure
you don't have anything

36:28.814 --> 36:30.314
you want to say
to him?

36:30.350 --> 36:32.316
I thought I would.

36:32.352 --> 36:36.352
In my head he's become
this great mythical monster.

36:36.388 --> 36:38.655
But now that
he's in front of me,

36:38.691 --> 36:44.464
all I can see is a weak,
broken shell of a man.

36:45.798 --> 36:50.667
No meaning has to come
from this happening to me.

36:50.703 --> 36:53.473
It's just a terrible thing
that happened in my past.

36:55.575 --> 36:57.508
Maybe something I'll never
truly recover from.

36:57.544 --> 37:00.678
- You might, if...
- It's okay.

37:00.714 --> 37:05.048
I have something
he doesn't...

37:05.084 --> 37:06.586
A future.

37:14.426 --> 37:17.061
If nothing else, I think we set
a hospital record today.

37:17.097 --> 37:20.363
Six figures...
on elective scans!

37:20.399 --> 37:23.470
You're lucky to have
a father who cares so much.

37:25.671 --> 37:27.537
When they brought you
into the ER,

37:27.573 --> 37:31.541
they said they could only give
medical info to family, so...

37:31.577 --> 37:32.975
I said I was your father.

37:33.011 --> 37:36.946
Someone has to
look out for you.

37:36.982 --> 37:40.718
I've given
one of these to each

37:40.754 --> 37:43.519
of my closest colleagues,
my inner circle.

37:43.555 --> 37:45.488
It's usually
an anniversary gift,

37:45.524 --> 37:47.423
ten years with
the company.

37:47.459 --> 37:49.927
Consider this
an investment

37:49.963 --> 37:51.598
in the next ten years.

37:54.600 --> 37:56.436
I don't know what to say.

37:58.705 --> 37:59.870
Thank you.

37:59.906 --> 38:01.608
You still up
for a trip tomorrow?

38:02.908 --> 38:04.073
Yes, sir.

38:04.109 --> 38:06.747
Let's go build
something together.

38:13.553 --> 38:15.052
What's all this about,
then?

38:15.088 --> 38:16.519
It's about Rich Dotcom.

38:16.555 --> 38:17.588
Sexual harassment's not
my department.

38:17.624 --> 38:18.956
A common mistake though...

38:18.992 --> 38:21.492
We're here to give you
our letters of support.

38:21.528 --> 38:23.494
I can't believe
that I'm gonna say this,

38:23.530 --> 38:25.061
but he deserves
to keep his job.

38:25.097 --> 38:27.097
He may be
an irreverent ass,

38:27.133 --> 38:29.066
but the work he does here
saves lives.

38:29.102 --> 38:32.035
Including all of ours.
Now, if we need to go

38:32.071 --> 38:33.102
over your head
and go straight

38:33.138 --> 38:34.807
to the Attorney General,
we will.

38:37.810 --> 38:39.742
I suppose I can...

38:39.778 --> 38:42.512
delay a decision
until his next annual review.

38:42.548 --> 38:45.418
Okay, great.
Thank you.

38:47.886 --> 38:51.155
Assistant Director,
a word please.

38:51.191 --> 38:53.624
- Okay.
- As honorable as it is

38:53.660 --> 38:56.093
that you went to bat
for your felon underling,

38:56.129 --> 38:57.528
you'd be better off saving
your goodwill

38:57.564 --> 38:59.495
at the Bureau for yourself.

38:59.531 --> 39:00.597
What are you talking about?

39:00.633 --> 39:03.901
Hirst hired you,
too, remember?

39:03.937 --> 39:05.806
You're next.

39:14.180 --> 39:15.878
Here's a
copy of the case file

39:15.914 --> 39:17.514
for the dragonfly tattoo.

39:17.550 --> 39:20.082
I figured the CIA
would want one, too.

39:20.118 --> 39:22.689
Yeah, thanks.

39:24.256 --> 39:27.791
Hey, Reade still has
some extra cake samples

39:27.827 --> 39:29.927
in the fridge,
if you wanted...

39:29.963 --> 39:31.794
No.

39:31.830 --> 39:33.966
This is the only relationship
I can have with you right now.

39:35.234 --> 39:37.066
- I made a mistake.
- I don't think you did.

39:37.102 --> 39:40.838
I think you're just someone
who can see things objectively,

39:40.874 --> 39:43.977
without friendships or emotions
getting in the way.

39:45.778 --> 39:47.613
The CIA is lucky
to have you.

40:07.267 --> 40:08.698
I told you not to come.

40:08.734 --> 40:10.633
From my own experience,
"don't come" usually means

40:10.669 --> 40:12.202
"I'm gonna
do something stupid

40:12.238 --> 40:14.508
and I don't want
any witnesses."

40:19.745 --> 40:21.711
Hey, seriously,
are you okay?

40:21.747 --> 40:23.613
Why did I agree
to be Borden's handler?

40:23.649 --> 40:25.852
I could have passed him off
to someone else...

40:28.254 --> 40:29.957
...but I didn't.

40:32.158 --> 40:34.157
What the hell
is wrong with me?

40:34.193 --> 40:35.892
Look, I think
you took the job

40:35.928 --> 40:39.061
because you didn't want to let
Borden out of your sights.

40:39.097 --> 40:41.999
You were protecting Patterson
the best way you knew how.

40:42.035 --> 40:43.800
Maybe someday
she'll see that.

40:43.836 --> 40:45.102
And you know what?
Even if she doesn't,

40:45.138 --> 40:47.637
it's fine,
you still got me.

40:47.673 --> 40:49.805
Everything's gonna
be okay.

40:49.841 --> 40:50.943
No, it's not...

40:55.647 --> 40:57.517
I'm in love with you.

41:00.687 --> 41:04.825
Sorry, I, uh...
I shouldn't have done that.

41:06.792 --> 41:08.758
You're damn right
you shouldn't have done that.

41:08.794 --> 41:12.031
I'm engaged!
You can't just say...

41:13.665 --> 41:15.631
Where was this
two years ago?!

41:15.667 --> 41:17.133
- What?
- Remember? I kissed you,

41:17.169 --> 41:19.236
and you told me you don't have
the same feelings for me.

41:19.272 --> 41:21.642
You said it was just
the painkillers.

41:30.249 --> 41:31.919
I gotta go.

41:33.019 --> 41:36.253
Wait...
Reade!

41:42.160 --> 41:43.961
Jane!
Weller!

41:43.997 --> 41:46.296
That text Roman sent you
this morning, I decrypted it.

41:46.332 --> 41:48.198
What did it say?

41:48.234 --> 41:50.200
It's an
invitation to a gala.

41:50.236 --> 41:51.767
Hosted by Crawford's daughter,
Blake.

41:51.803 --> 41:53.639
There was a message
with it, too.

41:54.906 --> 41:57.173
"Bruyere plus Crawford
equals Crawford hashtag"?

41:57.209 --> 41:58.675
It's chess notation.

41:58.711 --> 42:00.644
That hashtag means
"checkmate."

42:00.680 --> 42:02.044
He's saying
"Crawford checkmate."

42:02.080 --> 42:04.046
- What's happening at the gala?
- I don't know.

42:04.082 --> 42:06.649
But whatever it is,
Roman thinks it's enough

42:06.685 --> 42:08.887
to take down Crawford.
Tomorrow.
