00:15.133 --> 00:16.700
Today on "Sesame Street,"

00:16.767 --> 00:18.233
we're gonna see
lots of shapes.

00:18.300 --> 00:19.767
Oh, Square, Square,
excuse Elmo, excuse Elmo.

00:19.834 --> 00:20.934
Thank you.

00:21.000 --> 00:22.934
Now, as Elmo was saying,
there's gonna be lots

00:23.000 --> 00:24.433
of shapes--

00:24.500 --> 00:27.166
Oh, oh, oh, Circle, Circle,
Circle, excuse Elmo.

00:27.233 --> 00:28.500
Thank you. Ha ha!

00:28.567 --> 00:30.600
Now, Elmo can tell
that-- Oh, oh!

00:30.667 --> 00:32.467
Oh, Triangle!
Oh, excuse Elmo.

00:32.533 --> 00:34.300
Elmo's trying to talk
about shapes, OK?

00:34.367 --> 00:35.467
Oh.

00:35.533 --> 00:36.967
Hey. Wait a minute.

00:37.033 --> 00:39.433

01:16.900 --> 01:19.033
Hey, welcome
to Sesame Street.

01:19.100 --> 01:21.166
It's lunchtime around here,
so, right now,

01:21.233 --> 01:22.834
I'm gonna give Telly
his lunch--

01:22.900 --> 01:24.166
a grilled cheese sandwich.

01:24.233 --> 01:26.533
Whoa, boy. Ho ho.

01:26.600 --> 01:30.200
Look. It's cut into the most
delicious shape of all--

01:30.266 --> 01:33.400
triangles! Yum.

01:35.633 --> 01:37.033
W

01:37.100 --> 01:38.300
I have no idea.

01:39.433 --> 01:40.667
Oh!

01:40.734 --> 01:42.600
Who

01:42.667 --> 01:44.867
The name's Minnesota Mel,

01:44.934 --> 01:46.500
and I'm here
on one of my...

01:46.567 --> 01:49.567
patented, high-stakes
adventures.

01:49.633 --> 01:52.300
Hey, adventures?
What kind of adventure?

01:52.367 --> 01:53.734
It's called...

01:53.800 --> 01:56.700
"Minnesota Mel
and the golden triangle

01:56.767 --> 01:58.166
of destiny."

01:59.767 --> 02:02.066
The golden triangle
of destiny just happens to be

02:02.133 --> 02:04.633
the rarest,
most beautiful triangle

02:04.700 --> 02:06.166
in the whole wide world.

02:06.233 --> 02:07.266
- No!
- Yes!

02:07.333 --> 02:08.533
I wish I could see it.

02:09.767 --> 02:11.233
Behold...

02:11.300 --> 02:13.734
the golden triangle of destiny.

02:15.033 --> 02:17.700
Look at those
three golden sides--

02:17.767 --> 02:20.266
Telly:
One, two, three.

02:20.333 --> 02:21.233
Chris:
Hey, and check out

02:21.300 --> 02:22.500
those three blinged-out angles.

02:22.567 --> 02:25.633
One, two, three.

02:25.700 --> 02:28.433
That's the most beautiful
triangle I've ever seen.

02:28.500 --> 02:31.300
You bet it is, kid,
and that's why I won't rest

02:31.367 --> 02:32.467
until I find...

02:32.533 --> 02:34.667
the golden triangle
of destiny.

02:37.500 --> 02:41.066
Legend has it that this rare
triangle is hidden right here

02:41.133 --> 02:42.533
on Sesame Street.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.400
Oh, boy. Where is it?
Where is it?

02:44.467 --> 02:45.633
- I don't know yet.
- D'oh!

02:45.700 --> 02:47.266
But don't worry.

02:47.333 --> 02:50.467
I will stop at nothing
to find the golden triangle

02:50.533 --> 02:51.734
of destiny.

02:53.533 --> 02:55.834
Oh! Ow!

02:55.900 --> 02:58.934
Ooh. Looks like
he stopped at something.

02:59.000 --> 03:00.367
Oh!

03:00.433 --> 03:01.600
What's wrong,
Mr. Minnesota Mel?

03:01.667 --> 03:05.367
I got a charley horse. Ow!

03:05.433 --> 03:07.600
Oh, but...
that won't stop you

03:07.667 --> 03:09.333
from finding
the golden triangle

03:09.400 --> 03:11.333
of destiny, right,
Mr. Minnesota Mel?

03:11.400 --> 03:14.667
Yes, it will.
It burns. Ow!

03:14.734 --> 03:15.900
Oh, no. No.

03:15.967 --> 03:18.133
What about
the golden triangle?

03:18.200 --> 03:19.133
Sorry, Telly.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.200
You're gonna
have to wait

03:20.266 --> 03:21.266
till Minnesota Mel's
leg feels better.

03:21.333 --> 03:23.166
Wait? I can't wait.

03:23.233 --> 03:25.233
I've got to find
that triangle.

03:25.300 --> 03:26.233
You do?

03:26.300 --> 03:30.100
Chris, get ready for...

03:30.166 --> 03:33.700
Texas Telly and the golden
triangle of destiny.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.300
OK.

03:37.367 --> 03:38.500
Now, to look...

03:38.567 --> 03:40.233
for the triangle of destiny.

03:40.300 --> 03:42.100
Oh, triangle of destiny!

03:42.166 --> 03:45.200
Where are you,
triangle of destiny?

03:45.266 --> 03:46.667
What's that?

03:46.734 --> 03:48.667
I have no idea.

03:52.433 --> 03:54.400
Oh, just a giant boulder.

03:54.467 --> 03:57.100
- A giant boulder!
- A giant boulder!

03:57.166 --> 03:58.300
Run!

03:58.367 --> 03:59.400
I'm running!

03:59.467 --> 04:03.000
Aah!

04:03.066 --> 04:05.500
Run, Telly!

04:05.567 --> 04:07.900
Run!

04:12.400 --> 04:14.166
Hey. Why do you guys

04:14.233 --> 04:16.066
keep running away?

04:16.133 --> 04:18.300
Well, basically,
we don't want to get

04:18.367 --> 04:20.300
- smooshed by a giant boulder.
- Uh-huh.

04:20.367 --> 04:21.800
There's a giant boulder here?

04:21.867 --> 04:24.000
Where

04:24.066 --> 04:26.633
You're the giant boulder.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.500
Oh, yeah. I forgot.

04:29.567 --> 04:30.633
It's like I got rocks

04:30.700 --> 04:32.433
in my head or something.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.000
Anyway, I'm not here

04:34.066 --> 04:35.600
for smooshing purposes.

04:35.667 --> 04:38.100
I'm here to give you a clue.

04:38.166 --> 04:40.533
Oh, boy. What's the clue?
What's the clue?

04:40.600 --> 04:41.633
In order to find

04:41.700 --> 04:43.600
the golden triangle
of destiny,

04:43.667 --> 04:46.600
you need to look
under something.

04:46.667 --> 04:50.300
Oh, boy. "Under."
I've got to start looking

04:50.367 --> 04:51.500
"under."

04:51.567 --> 04:52.500
Well, good luck

04:52.567 --> 04:53.867
with your adventure.

04:53.934 --> 04:56.033
Now it's time
for this rolling rock

04:56.100 --> 04:57.900
to rock and roll.

04:57.967 --> 04:59.567
See you.

04:59.633 --> 05:00.934
- Bye.
- Bye.

05:01.033 --> 05:02.066
Let's see.

05:02.133 --> 05:04.333
To find the golden
triangle of destiny,

05:04.400 --> 05:06.667
I have to look
under something.

05:06.734 --> 05:08.266
What could I look under?

05:09.600 --> 05:11.233
What?
- Sounds-- Right now, right now.

05:11.300 --> 05:13.600
- It sounds so familiar.

05:13.667 --> 05:16.967
Oh, hey, there it goes.
It's just a snake.

05:17.033 --> 05:19.166
Hey, it's a snake. Hey.

05:19.233 --> 05:22.367
Snake. Why did it
have to be a snake?

05:22.433 --> 05:27.166
Monster. Why did it
have to be a monster?

05:27.233 --> 05:29.500
Chris: Hey there,
there, snaky friend.

05:29.567 --> 05:30.600
This is a nice monster.

05:30.667 --> 05:31.867
Yeah, thank you.

05:31.934 --> 05:34.266
Snake: Oh, good,
because I have your next clue.

05:34.333 --> 05:36.600
Oh, what is it?
What's the clue?

05:36.667 --> 05:39.400
Laundromat.

05:39.467 --> 05:42.633
Laundromat

05:42.700 --> 05:47.033
Where am I ever gonna find
a laundromat on Sesame Street?

05:47.100 --> 05:48.433
Right there.

05:48.500 --> 05:50.400
Oh, yes. You found it.

05:50.467 --> 05:51.734
Great job, Chris.

05:53.000 --> 05:54.433
What's going on?

05:54.500 --> 05:56.300
Aah!

05:56.367 --> 05:59.166
Aah!

05:59.233 --> 06:00.600
Aah!

06:00.667 --> 06:01.934
Oh!

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
Ugh!

06:05.066 --> 06:07.367
Shh, shh, shh!

06:07.433 --> 06:11.367
Wait a minute.
It's Texas Telly.

06:11.433 --> 06:12.633
You've heard of me.

06:12.700 --> 06:14.834
Heard of you?
You're a legend.

06:14.900 --> 06:16.934
Well, that's
all true, I guess--

06:17.000 --> 06:17.934
What are you doing

06:18.000 --> 06:19.533
in the laundromat,
Texas Telly?

06:19.600 --> 06:20.567
Ooh, ooh!
I bet he's here

06:20.633 --> 06:22.133
on an adventure.

06:22.200 --> 06:23.000
You're here
on an adventure, right?

06:23.066 --> 06:24.633
What's the adventure?

06:24.700 --> 06:25.500
I'm here to find...

06:25.567 --> 06:27.934
the golden triangle of destiny!

06:30.033 --> 06:31.900
Ooh, your own
heroic music theme.

06:31.967 --> 06:35.934
And I have two clues
to help me find the triangle.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.533
What are they?
What are the clues?

06:37.600 --> 06:40.266
The first clue is that
it's under something,

06:40.333 --> 06:43.667
and the second clue is
"laundromat," so I thought

06:43.734 --> 06:47.333
I'd look under some things
here inside the laundromat.

06:47.400 --> 06:50.600
We can look
under these clothes.

06:50.667 --> 06:51.900
Oh. Not the clothes--

06:51.967 --> 06:53.166
- Yeah!
- Yes!

06:53.233 --> 06:54.567
Not the clothes--

06:54.633 --> 06:57.133
It's gonna take me
a long time to clean up

06:57.200 --> 06:58.834
after this adventure.

07:01.033 --> 07:03.934
Oh, we'll never
find that triangle.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.667
We've looked under everything.

07:05.734 --> 07:06.900
Not everything.

07:06.967 --> 07:09.567
You can look
under that bottle

07:09.633 --> 07:11.400
of fabric softener.

07:17.233 --> 07:20.300
I'm texas Telly...
I'm texas Telly.

07:28.533 --> 07:30.967
Wow.

07:31.033 --> 07:33.533
Whoa. Look at that.

07:33.600 --> 07:34.667
I've got it.

07:34.734 --> 07:37.967
- Run, Texas Telly! Run!
- Run, Texas Telly! Run!

07:40.367 --> 07:42.400
Oh! Oh! Oh!

07:42.467 --> 07:44.834
Aah! Ohh! Aah!

07:47.500 --> 07:48.700
This is the messiest adventure

07:48.767 --> 07:51.000
I've ever seen.

07:51.066 --> 07:52.200
Here he comes.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.033
Texas Telly did it!

07:55.100 --> 07:57.467
He found...
the golden triangle

07:57.533 --> 07:59.033
of destiny!

08:00.567 --> 08:02.333
Wait a minute.

08:02.400 --> 08:03.533
What's wrong?

08:03.600 --> 08:05.700
This is not a triangle.

08:05.767 --> 08:08.500
A triangle has three sides,
and this has...

08:08.567 --> 08:13.934
Murray:
One, two, three, four,

08:14.000 --> 08:19.200
five, six, seven, eight.

08:19.266 --> 08:23.100
What in the world kind
of shape has eight sides?!

08:23.166 --> 08:24.700
Oh! It's called
an octagon.

08:24.767 --> 08:27.066
That's it. I give up.

08:27.133 --> 08:28.133
I can't do it.

08:28.200 --> 08:30.533
I can't find the golden triangle

08:30.600 --> 08:32.133
of destiny.

08:33.567 --> 08:36.166
And, I don't want
to hear that music anymore!

08:36.233 --> 08:38.800
Ow.

08:38.867 --> 08:41.266
Ow, ow.

08:41.333 --> 08:43.533
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

08:43.600 --> 08:45.367
What's wrong, Telly?

08:45.433 --> 08:47.433
There's something pointy
in this chair

08:47.500 --> 08:49.133
that keeps poking me.

08:49.200 --> 08:49.967
- Yeah.

08:50.033 --> 08:51.200
What is it?

08:51.266 --> 08:53.033
Oh, I don't know.
Let me check

08:53.100 --> 08:55.700
under this cushion and see.

08:59.100 --> 09:01.166
It's--it's...

09:04.767 --> 09:07.700
the golden
triangle of destiny.

09:08.767 --> 09:09.700
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa--

09:09.767 --> 09:11.467
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

09:11.533 --> 09:14.400
We have to count the sides
to make sure it's a triangle.

09:14.467 --> 09:18.000
One, two, three.

09:18.066 --> 09:19.500
It has three sides, and look,

09:19.567 --> 09:24.433
it has one, two, three--three
angles.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.367
That means it's...

09:26.433 --> 09:28.667
Ow. Ow--

09:28.734 --> 09:32.266
The golden triangle
of destiny.

09:34.667 --> 09:36.233
I've finally found it.

09:36.300 --> 09:37.934
You found it?

09:38.000 --> 09:39.433
Wait a minute.
Telly found that triangle.

09:39.500 --> 09:40.633
It belongs to him.

09:40.700 --> 09:42.333
Well, he would have never known

09:42.400 --> 09:44.633
about this triangle
if it weren't for me.

09:44.700 --> 09:47.300
Murray: Yeah,
but Texas Telly found it.

09:47.367 --> 09:49.633
Sorry. It's mine.

09:49.700 --> 09:50.567
Telly's!

09:50.633 --> 09:51.967
Mine!

09:52.033 --> 09:53.000
Telly's!

09:53.066 --> 09:54.333
Hold it!

09:54.400 --> 09:56.533
The golden triangle
of destiny

He was a pirate
who wouldn't give up

13:22.900 --> 13:24.266
until he found the treasure.

13:24.333 --> 13:28.066
Me got to find

Male voice:
But finding that treasure

13:29.433 --> 13:31.033
was much harder
than he thought.

13:31.100 --> 13:32.066
- Capitán Snack.
- Yeah.

13:32.133 --> 13:33.500
¡Mira!

13:33.567 --> 13:36.233
The map says
that the treasure
is in there.

13:36.300 --> 13:39.233
Oh, boy, oh,
boy, oh, boy, oh, boy-- Ooh!

13:39.300 --> 13:40.967
Oh!

13:41.033 --> 13:42.600
Why this cave not open?

13:42.667 --> 13:46.133
The map shows two hands
holding triangles.

13:46.200 --> 13:47.900
Just like those.

13:47.967 --> 13:49.100
- Yeah. Over there.

13:49.166 --> 13:52.600
Oh! Uh, but, uh,
these hands empty.

13:52.667 --> 13:53.834
Mira, Capitán.

13:53.900 --> 13:55.100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:55.166 --> 13:56.166
- Shapes!

13:56.233 --> 13:57.500
- There!
- Ooh!

13:57.567 --> 14:00.100
Yeah. Maybe we need
to find the triangles
and put them

14:00.166 --> 14:02.367
on the hands
just like in the map.

14:02.433 --> 14:04.400
Good thinking.
Me got it.

14:04.467 --> 14:05.633
Me on this.

14:05.700 --> 14:06.667
Ooh! That nice shape.

14:06.734 --> 14:08.066
Capi--

14:10.333 --> 14:14.333
Hey. Why cave throw
shape at me?

14:14.400 --> 14:15.934
Because that shape,
Capitán,

14:16.000 --> 14:19.066
Has one, two,
three, four sides.

14:19.133 --> 14:20.667
It's a square.

14:20.734 --> 14:23.033
You need to focus
and find a shape

14:23.100 --> 14:25.166
with one, two,
three sides--

14:25.233 --> 14:26.500
a triangle.

14:26.567 --> 14:27.467
Yeah, but how me do that?

14:27.533 --> 14:29.400
How me focus?

14:29.467 --> 14:31.333
You're a pirate,
Capitán Snack.

14:31.400 --> 14:35.834
Use your pretend spyglass
and focus on the triangles.

14:35.900 --> 14:37.100
Me give it try.

14:38.467 --> 14:42.567
Hmm. Oh. Yeah. It working.

14:42.633 --> 14:46.600
Yes. Me focus on triangles.

14:46.667 --> 14:48.300
Ooh! There good one.

14:48.367 --> 14:49.300
Oh! That another one.

14:49.367 --> 14:50.500
- Oh, boy, oh, boy.
- A triangle!

14:50.567 --> 14:51.900
OK.

14:55.300 --> 14:56.433
Oh, boy, oh, boy,

14:56.500 --> 14:58.400
Oh, boy, oh, boy!

14:58.467 --> 15:00.934
Oh! Why this cave
not open more?

15:01.033 --> 15:03.500
Let's look
at the map, Capitán.

15:03.567 --> 15:05.700
Davey Jones: You're getting
too close to me cookie jar.

15:05.767 --> 15:07.266
I'm changing the rules.

15:07.333 --> 15:09.800
Heh heh heh.

15:11.233 --> 15:14.033
The shapes in the hands
turned orange.

15:14.100 --> 15:15.033
Do you know
what this means?

15:15.100 --> 15:16.533
Scurvy!

15:16.600 --> 15:18.133
- No.
- No, not scurvy.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.967
No, it means we have
to think differently

15:21.033 --> 15:22.500
- and focus on the color.
- OK.

15:22.567 --> 15:24.100
Yes!

15:24.166 --> 15:26.934
and put the orange
shapes in them.

15:27.000 --> 15:29.066
Oh, well, then,

15:29.133 --> 15:30.233
But-- Oh.

15:32.533 --> 15:35.633
Hey. Why cave

15:35.700 --> 15:37.200
Pero por favor,
Capitán Snack.

15:37.266 --> 15:40.333
You put in something
that wasn't orange.

15:40.400 --> 15:42.166
Oh, sorry. Me thought

15:42.233 --> 15:43.667

15:43.734 --> 15:46.600
No. Oh, boy,
this so frustrating!

15:46.667 --> 15:48.200
You know what?

15:48.266 --> 15:49.367
- Me give up.

15:49.433 --> 15:50.667
- Wha--

15:50.734 --> 15:52.567
Never, Capitán!

15:52.633 --> 15:57.100
You need to use your spyglass
and focus on the color orange

15:57.166 --> 16:01.333
and only put orange shapes
in the hands.

16:01.400 --> 16:02.900

16:02.967 --> 16:03.967

20:31.266 --> 20:35.500
Oh, guess what Elmo
is wondering about today.

20:35.567 --> 20:37.500
Wait for it.

20:37.567 --> 20:40.567
Wait for it!

20:40.633 --> 20:43.233
Oh, ho ho ho! Shapes.

20:43.300 --> 20:45.667
- Hi, Circle.
- Hi!

20:45.734 --> 20:48.000
- Hi, Rhombus.
- Yo!

20:48.066 --> 20:50.066
Oh! Elmo loves shapes

20:50.133 --> 20:52.600
and wants to find out
more about them.

20:52.667 --> 20:56.200
Hey! Let's ask
Elmo's friend, Smartie.

20:56.266 --> 20:58.066
Let's call her together.

20:58.133 --> 21:00.867
Elmo and kids:
♪ Oh, Smartie ♪

21:00.934 --> 21:03.133
( Smartie playing
"Elmo's Song" )

21:03.200 --> 21:06.400
- Hiya, Elmo.
- Oh! Hi, Smartie.

21:06.467 --> 21:08.066
Check out my screen!

21:08.133 --> 21:10.700
Each button is
a different shape!

21:10.767 --> 21:12.166
That's perfect, Smartie,

21:12.233 --> 21:15.533
because Elmo wants to learn
all about shapes today!

21:15.600 --> 21:18.333
Well, what we do
to learn something new?

21:18.400 --> 21:21.500
All:
We look it up!

21:21.567 --> 21:23.400
Here we go.

21:23.467 --> 21:26.400
Shapes are all around us.

21:26.467 --> 21:28.200
Look around,
and you can see shapes

21:28.266 --> 21:29.767
like circles,

21:29.834 --> 21:31.233
squares,

21:31.300 --> 21:32.667
and triangles.

21:32.734 --> 21:35.033
A stop sign has eight sides.

21:35.100 --> 21:37.133
That's called an octagon.

21:37.200 --> 21:38.600
Shapes can even be put together

21:38.667 --> 21:40.266
to make other shapes.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.567
Like, these two squares
go together

21:42.633 --> 21:44.967
to make one rectangle.

21:45.033 --> 21:46.834
We can even use shapes
to play games

21:46.900 --> 21:48.667
like hopscotch.

21:51.633 --> 21:55.400
All that info really rounds out
my knowledge about shapes.

21:55.467 --> 21:57.166
Rounds?
- Ha ha!

21:57.233 --> 21:58.567
See you later, Elmo.

21:58.633 --> 22:00.967
Bye-bye, Smartie.
Thank you.

22:01.033 --> 22:05.300
Ha ha! Hey!
That gives Elmo an idea.

22:05.367 --> 22:08.100
Oh, ho. Let's play
a game together.

22:08.166 --> 22:11.200
Yeah! Come on,
come on. Ha ha!

22:14.700 --> 22:17.567
Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha!

22:17.633 --> 22:21.233
Ha ha! Can you help Elmo
find all the circles

22:21.300 --> 22:22.567
in this picture?

22:22.633 --> 22:25.133
Come on! Let's play.

22:25.200 --> 22:27.033
Kid:
I see circles!

22:27.100 --> 22:28.633
Kid 2:
Look out the window.

22:28.700 --> 22:29.834
Oh, yeah.

22:29.900 --> 22:32.467
The sun is shaped
like a circle.

22:32.533 --> 22:34.667
Elmo:
Let's find another circle.

22:34.734 --> 22:37.066
Kid:
Look on the table.

22:37.133 --> 22:40.133
Is this cereal box
shaped like a circle?

22:40.200 --> 22:43.266
Kid:
No. That's shaped
like a rectangle.

22:43.333 --> 22:44.667
How about this?

22:44.734 --> 22:47.567
Kid 2:
Yeah. That's a circle!

22:47.633 --> 22:49.433
Elmo: Yeah! Are there
any more circles

22:49.500 --> 22:51.433
in the kitchen?

22:51.500 --> 22:54.533
Kid:
I see one! It goes,
"tick-tock."

22:54.600 --> 22:56.100
Elmo: Oh, yeah.

22:56.166 --> 22:58.400
The last circle is the clock.

22:58.467 --> 23:01.066
Thank you for helping
Elmo find the circles.

23:01.133 --> 23:02.467
Oh, ho ho ho!

23:02.533 --> 23:05.033
Boy, shapes are so cool-- oh,

23:05.100 --> 23:08.133
and that makes Elmo
wonder even more.

23:08.200 --> 23:10.734
Oh. Does Mr. Noodle
know about shapes?

23:10.800 --> 23:13.266
Oh, let's ask him.
Ha ha hee hee!

23:13.333 --> 23:15.600
♪ Hey, Mr. Noodle ♪

23:15.667 --> 23:18.300
Oh, ho ho!
It's Mr. Noodle's sister,

23:18.367 --> 23:20.266
Ms. Noodle.

23:20.333 --> 23:22.100
Oh. Hi, Ms. Noodle.

23:22.166 --> 23:24.333
Ms. Noodle,
Elmo was wondering.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.266
Can you show us
some shapes?

23:26.333 --> 23:29.000
- Kids: Yeah!

23:29.066 --> 23:31.667
Kids:
Show us a triangle, Ms. Noodle.

23:34.567 --> 23:36.400
Kid:
No, Ms. Noodle.

23:36.467 --> 23:39.000
Kid 2:
That's not a triangle.

23:39.066 --> 23:41.166
Elmo: That's a really nice
picture frame, Ms. Noodle,

23:41.233 --> 23:44.200
but Elmo sees a rectangle.

23:44.266 --> 23:47.934
Yeah. A rectangle
has four sides.

23:48.000 --> 23:53.133
Elmo and kids:
One, two, three, four.

23:53.200 --> 23:55.166
Kid:
Keep looking for a triangle.

23:55.233 --> 23:56.500
Kid 2:
You can do it!

23:58.900 --> 24:00.667
Kids:
No, Ms. Noodle.

24:00.734 --> 24:02.734
Elmo:
That sandwich is a square,

24:02.800 --> 24:04.367
not a triangle.

24:06.467 --> 24:07.633
What's she doing?

24:10.300 --> 24:11.667
Oh, ho ho ho!

24:11.734 --> 24:13.467
Look what Ms. Noodle did!

24:13.533 --> 24:15.467
She made a triangle.

24:15.533 --> 24:17.567
Yeah, baby!
That's a triangle

24:17.633 --> 24:20.000
because it has three sides.

24:20.066 --> 24:22.700
Elmo and Kids:
One, two, three.

24:22.767 --> 24:25.000
Kids:
Yay, Ms. Noodle! You did it!

24:25.066 --> 24:28.467
Elmo: Yay! Ms. Noodle
made two triangles

24:28.533 --> 24:31.300
out of one square.

24:31.367 --> 24:34.033
Great job, Ms. Noodle!

24:34.100 --> 24:35.934
Thank you
for showing us triangles.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.433
Bye-bye!

24:37.500 --> 24:41.667
