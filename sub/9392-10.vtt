I mean, I turned 18 today.

00:41.509 --> 00:42.941
Oh, come on, Meg.

00:42.943 --> 00:45.010
You always used to love
the Teen Choice Awards.

00:45.012 --> 00:46.779
Yeah, ever since Fox
pulled this contrived night

00:46.781 --> 00:49.314
of (bleep) out of
their ass, in an effort

00:49.316 --> 00:51.016
to get in on the awards
show business,

00:51.018 --> 00:52.651
it's been very
special to you.

We're gonna kick things off

02:01.989 --> 02:03.155

02:03.157 --> 02:08.160
Give it up for our first
presenter, Wilford Brimley!

02:08.162 --> 02:10.829
It's entirely too loud in here!

02:10.831 --> 02:12.297
Quiet down!

02:12.299 --> 02:14.700
There's no accountability
anymore!

02:14.702 --> 02:16.034
I have diabetes!

02:16.036 --> 02:18.704
Hey, what do you say we get
some music in here, huh?

02:18.706 --> 02:20.272
No, that'll only
make things worse!

02:20.274 --> 02:22.875
Give it up for our first
nominated Choice Band

02:22.877 --> 02:25.477

02:42.162 --> 02:44.663
(all screaming in fear)

02:49.869 --> 02:51.436
Well, that was
unfortunate.

02:51.438 --> 02:53.672
Hey, what's with all
the cars on the street?

02:53.674 --> 02:55.641
Oh, they're all here
for your surprise party, Meg.

02:55.643 --> 02:57.442
Peter, for God's
sake, you idiot!

02:57.444 --> 02:59.444
We were supposed
to open the door

02:59.446 --> 03:01.380
so everyone could
yell "surprise!"

03:02.882 --> 03:04.283
Surprise!

03:04.285 --> 03:06.952
Oh... Oh, dear.

03:06.954 --> 03:09.688
Mom, if it's a surprise party,
where is everybody?

03:09.690 --> 03:10.923
(hushed):
Chris, what the hell?!

03:10.925 --> 03:12.758
I thought you were
gonna pay the kids

03:12.760 --> 03:15.027
from school to show up!
I gave you $300!

03:15.029 --> 03:16.762
Why do you think
Dad's here?

03:16.764 --> 03:17.996
Hey, Meg, happy birthday.

03:17.998 --> 03:19.965
You're the coolest.

03:19.967 --> 03:22.201
Well, then what are all the cars
doing out there?

03:22.203 --> 03:23.936
Oh, they must be
for Mort's party.

03:23.938 --> 03:26.038
Okay, the first rule
of Jewish fight club

03:26.040 --> 03:29.508
is if somebody says,
"Ow," you stop.

03:29.510 --> 03:30.642
Ow!

03:30.644 --> 03:31.877
Okay, let's eat.

03:31.879 --> 03:33.879
I'm really sorry
about this, honey.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.981
I-It looks like
nobody's coming.

03:35.983 --> 03:38.784
But we had fun at the Teen
Choice Awards, right?

03:38.786 --> 03:39.918
I guess.

03:39.920 --> 03:42.154
Well, I guess we
ought to call it a night.

03:42.156 --> 03:43.855
Come on, Stewie.
Up to bed.

03:43.857 --> 03:47.125
No party? Oh, come on.
I was gonna show a slide show

03:47.127 --> 03:49.361
of all those silly photos
I took of Meg.

03:58.104 --> 04:00.005
Well, happy birthday
anyway, Meg.

04:00.007 --> 04:01.540
See you in the morning.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.208
(doorbell rings)

04:04.210 --> 04:06.178
Hey, Quagmire.
What's going on?

04:06.180 --> 04:07.813
Well, Peter,
a little birdie told me

04:07.815 --> 04:08.947
that today is
Meg's birthday.

04:08.949 --> 04:09.948
You giving me credit?

04:09.950 --> 04:11.116
Yeah, I just told him.

04:11.118 --> 04:12.651
I'm the one
who told him.

04:13.686 --> 04:16.021
So where is
the birthday girl?

04:16.023 --> 04:17.356
Oh, hi, Mr. Quagmire.

04:17.358 --> 04:20.759
Oh, please,
my father is Mr. Quagmi--

04:20.761 --> 04:22.427
Oh, no. He's... Okay,
well, he used

04:22.429 --> 04:23.629
to be Mr. Quagmire.

04:23.631 --> 04:25.697
Now he's, how he's
just Ida Davis.

04:25.699 --> 04:28.133
Anyway, this is a special day
for you, young lady.

04:28.135 --> 04:30.969
Here's a gift for ya.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.104
A scented candle?

04:32.106 --> 04:34.106
As a girl,
I love this!

04:34.108 --> 04:35.974
That was originally $30.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.943
Thanks, Mr. Quagmire.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.344
Well, it's your
18th birthday, Meg.

04:39.346 --> 04:40.879
That's a very important
milestone in

04:40.881 --> 04:41.880
a young girl's...

04:41.882 --> 04:43.615
I mean, a young
woman's life.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.183
Hey, welcome
to the adult club, huh?

04:45.185 --> 04:46.485
And you know what?

04:46.487 --> 04:47.853
You got another member
right next door

04:47.855 --> 04:49.588
if you ever want
to talk and stuff.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.023
Happy birthday.

04:54.527 --> 04:56.628
Hey... Hey, where's
that pinky going, huh?

04:56.630 --> 04:58.330
Where's he going?

04:58.332 --> 05:00.499
Wha, what's he doing?
Get back here.

05:00.501 --> 05:01.867
There you go.

05:01.869 --> 05:04.670
Look at Quagmire hitting
on that skank.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.338
You know he's gonna
close the deal.

05:06.340 --> 05:07.839
Peter, that skank is
your daughter.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.374
Oh, my God,
you're right!

05:09.376 --> 05:11.610
You know, Meg,
I'd love to see you

05:11.612 --> 05:13.045
without your hat on.

05:13.047 --> 05:14.112
Okay.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.953
So, anyway, I'm on approach
into Lambert Field

05:21.955 --> 05:24.523
in some of the worst turbulence
I've ever flown through.

05:24.525 --> 05:26.491
I mean, I have never seen
anything like it.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.694
Everyone in the cabin
was, like, "Aah!"

05:28.696 --> 05:30.128
but I kept my cool.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.764
I trusted my training,
and brought the plane in safely,

05:32.766 --> 05:34.599
and in fact,
it turned out, ironically,

05:34.601 --> 05:36.868
to be one of the smoothest
landings I've ever made.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.037
Well, gosh, Quagmire,
this has been a fun night,

05:39.039 --> 05:41.340
but I guess, uh, you better be
getting home now, huh?

05:41.342 --> 05:42.641
Yeah, it is getting late.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.943
I guess I'll go home
and rub out a giggity.

05:44.945 --> 05:45.977
Take it easy, you guys.

05:45.979 --> 05:47.112
See you later, Meg.
(clicks tongue)

05:47.114 --> 05:49.281
Bye.

05:49.283 --> 05:50.182
Okay, that was weird.

05:50.184 --> 05:51.249
That was weird.
Right?

05:51.251 --> 05:52.584
Oh, my God,
so weird.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.519
I tell you something,
if he touches my daughter,

05:54.521 --> 05:56.121
I'm gonna be kicking butts
and taking names!

05:56.123 --> 05:57.322
And then giving
those names

05:57.324 --> 05:58.990
to other people
whose butts I kick.

05:58.992 --> 06:00.792
What's your name?

06:00.794 --> 06:02.094
Derek.

06:02.096 --> 06:03.695
What's your name?

06:03.697 --> 06:04.596
Michael.

06:04.598 --> 06:05.764
You're Derek now!

06:09.102 --> 06:12.003
(phone beeps)

06:16.042 --> 06:17.008
(phone chimes)

06:17.010 --> 06:18.176
Oh! (chuckles)

06:21.948 --> 06:23.682
(phone beeps)

06:28.621 --> 06:29.988
(phone chimes)

06:41.868 --> 06:43.101
(phone chimes)

06:46.672 --> 06:48.006
(phone beeps)

06:56.983 --> 06:58.183
(phone chimes)

07:00.319 --> 07:03.555
Okay, Glenn,
time to reel her in.

07:04.457 --> 07:06.091
(phone beeps)

07:08.327 --> 07:09.561
(phone chimes)

07:10.963 --> 07:13.865
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God!

07:16.202 --> 07:18.537
Ah, it's too much, too much.

07:19.505 --> 07:21.039
(phone beeps)

07:23.309 --> 07:25.210
I love stars!

07:27.814 --> 07:30.949
We now return to <i>Grainy Footage</i>
<i>of a Potential Bigfoot</i>

07:30.951 --> 07:34.019
that will surely spark a lively
debate in your household.

07:37.123 --> 07:38.757
Oh, my God!
That is real!

07:38.759 --> 07:40.992
No, total fake.
(all talking at once)

07:40.994 --> 07:42.928
Look at that.
That is obviously
a suit. It's a fraud.

07:42.930 --> 07:44.362
Look at the way
it walks.

07:44.364 --> 07:45.931
Totally fake.
Why would somebody
make that up, Lois?

07:45.933 --> 07:47.098
What's in it for them?

07:47.100 --> 07:48.800
(knocking)

07:48.802 --> 07:50.635
Oh, hey, Mr. G.
How's it going?

07:50.637 --> 07:52.003
Quagmire, what are you
doing here?

07:52.005 --> 07:53.371
Hi, Glenn.
Bye, you guys.

07:53.373 --> 07:55.040
Me and Glenn
are going out.

07:55.042 --> 07:56.641
What?! Like
hell you are!

07:56.643 --> 07:59.377
Don't worry, Dad!
I'll take care of him!

07:59.379 --> 08:01.680
Stay away from my sis!

08:01.682 --> 08:03.815
Okay, you two have
fun on your date.

08:03.817 --> 08:05.317
What?!
Drive carefully.

08:05.319 --> 08:06.818
We'll see you later.

08:06.820 --> 08:08.253
Lois, are you out
of your mind?!

08:08.255 --> 08:10.121
We can't let Quagmire
take Meg out on a date!

08:10.123 --> 08:11.590
That guy'll bang anything.

08:11.592 --> 08:13.358
Hey, Lois, I'm starving.
What's for dinner?

08:13.360 --> 08:15.594
I made meatloaf.
It's in the fridge.

08:15.596 --> 08:17.529
Hey, Peter, do you mind?

08:17.531 --> 08:18.997
But I have
to get dinner.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.432
Go out!

08:20.434 --> 08:21.466
Peter, nothing's
gonna happen.

08:21.468 --> 08:22.801
Don't you see?

08:22.803 --> 08:24.936
She's only doing this
to get a rise out of us.

08:24.938 --> 08:27.038
If we fight her on it,
she'll only push further.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.974
Well, she may not plan
on sleeping with him,

08:28.976 --> 08:31.142
but you don't know how
smooth Quagmire is, Lois.

08:31.144 --> 08:32.110
He's like a vagician.

08:32.112 --> 08:33.545
Oh, that's clever.

08:33.547 --> 08:35.981
I know! Isn't it?
He practices vagic.

08:35.983 --> 08:37.115
"Vagician" was funnier.

08:37.117 --> 08:39.150
Okay, well, the point is,
we ought to be worried.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.151
Peter, trust me.

08:40.153 --> 08:42.087
I know what's going on
in her head.

08:42.089 --> 08:43.088
It's just a game.

08:43.090 --> 08:45.357
I used to do the same
thing to my parents.

08:45.359 --> 08:46.858
The problem is,
they pushed back,

08:46.860 --> 08:49.027
and the results
were not good.

08:49.929 --> 08:51.029
Mr. Pewterschmidt,

08:51.031 --> 08:52.330
we pumped your
daughter's stomach

08:52.332 --> 08:54.799
and we found vodka, Rohypnol,
a fair amount of DNA

08:54.801 --> 08:57.035
that is not her own
and a class ring.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.103
Harvard?

08:58.105 --> 09:00.505
I think it was
SUNY something.

09:00.507 --> 09:02.374
Oh, I don't want
to hear any more!

09:04.510 --> 09:05.877
So how're
your studies going?

09:05.879 --> 09:07.112
They're going
pretty good.

09:07.114 --> 09:08.880
School's good.

09:08.882 --> 09:09.915
What's your favorite class?

09:09.917 --> 09:11.950
What was <i>your</i>
<i>favorite class?</i>

09:11.952 --> 09:13.785
Okay, let's say it
at the same time

09:13.787 --> 09:14.953
and see if they're
the same.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.655
Okay, one, two, three.

09:16.657 --> 09:18.023
Hist... math!
Math!

09:18.025 --> 09:20.158
Oh, my God, we have
so much in common!

09:20.160 --> 09:21.826
Do you have any brothers
or sisters?

09:21.828 --> 09:23.128
Yeah, I have
two brothers.

09:23.130 --> 09:23.995
Aw, they sound
terrific.

09:23.997 --> 09:25.530
Hey, you want to blow
this joint?

09:25.532 --> 09:26.531
Sure.

09:26.533 --> 09:29.000
Oh, wow, really?!
All right, go for it!

09:29.002 --> 09:30.602
Come on. Let's go.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.103
Oh, oh, you,
you mean leave.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.939
No, yeah, sure.
No, let's go.

09:36.842 --> 09:39.144
Gosh, Meg, I sure had
a swell time with you.

09:39.146 --> 09:41.479
Me, too, Glenn.
God, it's so amazing

09:41.481 --> 09:43.648
that you've been my dad's friend
for, like, years,

09:43.650 --> 09:45.116
and now we have this connection.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.651
Hey, do you want
to come in

09:46.653 --> 09:48.019
for some Crystal Light
or something?

09:48.021 --> 09:50.822
Well, I do believe in me,
but it's getting kind of late.

09:50.824 --> 09:53.258
Um, I really want to
see you again, though.

09:53.260 --> 09:55.360
Oh, you know it.

10:03.102 --> 10:04.469
Oh, God, Peter!

10:04.471 --> 10:05.837
Scared the
hell out of me!

10:05.839 --> 10:08.139
What're you doing here?
I think you know.

10:08.141 --> 10:09.674
Did you have sex
with my daughter?

10:09.676 --> 10:11.643
What? Come on, Peter.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.111
Did you have sex
with my daughter?!

10:13.113 --> 10:14.846
Peter, trust me,
it's not happening.

10:14.848 --> 10:16.181
(sighs)
All right. Good.

10:16.183 --> 10:17.916
Yeah, she's really making
me work for it.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.651
Maybe you could
talk to her.

10:19.653 --> 10:20.952
Well, I'll try,

10:20.954 --> 10:23.088
but sometimes she can be
as stubborn as a mule.

10:23.090 --> 10:24.789
I tell you, you tell her
to do something once,

10:24.791 --> 10:26.091
she does the opposite.

10:26.093 --> 10:27.926
You know, it's like
she ain't even heard you

10:27.928 --> 10:29.094
in the first place.

10:29.096 --> 10:30.462
It's like talking
to a brick wall.

10:30.464 --> 10:31.930
Worse than talking...

10:31.932 --> 10:34.032
Even a brick wall doesn't tell
you they understand you,

10:34.034 --> 10:35.433
and then go do the opposite,
you know?

10:35.435 --> 10:36.968
So it's no surprise to me

10:36.970 --> 10:40.972
That-that just seems
to be the way she is.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.108
You know, whether it's just
that she's not listening

10:43.110 --> 10:45.477
or whether it's that she's
making a conscious decision

10:45.479 --> 10:48.546
to defy your wishes,
who can say, you know?

10:48.548 --> 10:50.081
And I would say,
in some respects,

10:50.083 --> 10:52.517
having a strong-willed kid
is a good thing,

10:52.519 --> 10:54.753
but it can get frustrating
as hell on the other side.

10:54.755 --> 10:55.954
So, you know, believe me,

10:55.956 --> 10:57.288
I hear loud and clear
where you're--

10:57.290 --> 10:59.691
Wait a second!
No, I won't talk to her!

10:59.693 --> 11:01.993
And I want you to stay the hell
away from her!

11:01.995 --> 11:04.029
Peter it's me-- Quagmire.

11:04.031 --> 11:05.664
This is what I do.

11:05.666 --> 11:08.299
Besides, Meg is 18 now
and you've gotta let go.

11:08.301 --> 11:10.368
You've done your job.
It's my turn now.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.671
Look, Quagmire, you're
one of my best pals,

11:12.673 --> 11:14.873
and I'm asking you
not to do this.

11:14.875 --> 11:16.675
I want to help you,
Peter, I really do,

11:16.677 --> 11:19.010
but it's-- it's like you're
asking a fish not to swim.

11:19.012 --> 11:20.545
She's legal and I'm going in.

11:20.547 --> 11:21.946
Well, we'll see about that.

11:21.948 --> 11:23.982
I ain't afraid
to stand up to friends.

11:23.984 --> 11:24.983
Just ask Spartacus.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.651
I'm Spartacus.

11:26.653 --> 11:27.986
I'm Spartacus.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.387
That guy's
Spartacus.

11:32.291 --> 11:36.594
ANNOUNCER:
We now return to <i>Two Lame</i>
<i>Chicks on Vacation in Mexico.</i>

11:37.596 --> 11:40.131
Oh, my God, don't
drink the water.

11:40.133 --> 11:42.701
I'm so going to brush
my teeth with tequila.

11:42.703 --> 11:44.469
Mexico!
Mexico!

11:44.471 --> 11:46.137
Hey, is this beach topless?

11:46.139 --> 11:48.673
No, but my
margarita's bottomless.

11:48.675 --> 11:50.308
Mexico!
Mexico!

11:50.310 --> 11:53.344
That cute guy's been
staring at you all night.

11:53.346 --> 11:57.115
Oh, my God. I'm going to go poo
now, so I don't have to later.

11:57.117 --> 11:58.783
Mexico!
Mexico!

11:58.785 --> 12:01.820
Hey, you want to see
my pictures from Mexico?

12:01.822 --> 12:06.291
Look, Janine, I just-- this is--
I can't with you anymore.

12:06.293 --> 12:08.927
It's all the time.
This is a job.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.628
Please take off
that silly hat.

12:10.630 --> 12:12.597
(phone ringing)

12:12.599 --> 12:16.534
GIRL: Mexico!
I... I can't talk right now.

12:19.038 --> 12:20.004
You okay?

12:20.006 --> 12:21.306
Yeah, babe.

12:21.308 --> 12:23.007
I got to pee,
but I don't want to move.

12:23.009 --> 12:24.809
I'm so comfortable right now.

12:24.811 --> 12:26.044
I can pause it.

12:26.046 --> 12:27.345
I guess you could
pause it...

12:27.347 --> 12:28.613
but you can't pause me!

12:28.615 --> 12:29.848
Fast forward.
Fast forward.

12:29.850 --> 12:31.483
Fast forward.
Glenn, stop.

12:31.485 --> 12:32.984
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe either.

12:32.986 --> 12:34.018
This is torture
for me, too.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.019
No fair. Stop.

12:35.021 --> 12:36.921
I'm going to...
(farts)

12:36.923 --> 12:38.289
Sorry.

12:38.291 --> 12:40.525
Ah, that's all right.
It's just your body.

12:40.527 --> 12:42.093
Sometimes things slip out.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.828
Probably just making
room for something.

12:43.830 --> 12:45.296
Like what?

12:45.298 --> 12:47.866
Hey, gang, got room for one more
right in the middle of you two?

12:47.868 --> 12:49.768
Come on, scooch apart, there.

12:49.770 --> 12:51.836
Ooh, what's this?
Quagmire's cell phone?

12:51.838 --> 12:53.338
Well, now that you're with Meg,

12:53.340 --> 12:56.007
you don't need to be talking to,
uh, "Backbush" anymore.

12:56.009 --> 12:58.643
Oh, and I'll send a text to
"Possible Nipple Ring"

12:58.645 --> 13:00.044
saying you're off the market.

13:00.046 --> 13:01.846
(phone beeps)

13:01.848 --> 13:04.082
You're "Possible Nipple Ring"?

13:04.084 --> 13:06.284
All right, well, I better
send a text to "Backbush."

13:06.286 --> 13:07.452
(buzzing)

13:07.454 --> 13:08.953
Oh, come on.
I'm "Backbush"?

13:08.955 --> 13:10.622
This can't be a
surprise to you, Peter.

13:10.624 --> 13:11.990
Yeah, I knew.

13:11.992 --> 13:14.726
(sobbing):
I just didn't know you knew.

13:16.495 --> 13:18.129
Okay, what compound is this?

13:18.131 --> 13:19.531
That's sodium chloride.

13:19.533 --> 13:20.999
That's right.
How about this one?

13:21.001 --> 13:22.433
Hydrogen peroxide.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.435
God, you're so smart.
How about this one?

13:24.437 --> 13:27.639
QM2? I'm not sure
what that is.

13:27.641 --> 13:28.973
It's Quag-megium.

13:28.975 --> 13:30.942
It's the strongest
compound on Earth.

13:30.944 --> 13:32.377
Nothing can separate it.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.712
It has an atomic weight
of awesome.

13:34.714 --> 13:36.681
You're such a
cutie patootie.

13:36.683 --> 13:39.651
If I'm a cutie patootie, then
you're a peenie-vageenie.

13:39.653 --> 13:40.652
Aww!

13:40.654 --> 13:43.354
I heard a cute "aw" in there.
Cool down!

13:47.993 --> 13:50.662
Meg, there's something
we need to talk about.

13:50.664 --> 13:52.997
Dad, I swear to God, I thought
you could flush those things.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.700
Meg, you ever heard
of Joan Van Ark?
No.

13:55.702 --> 13:57.368
Here's a picture
of Joan Van Ark.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.170
Oh, my God, she's gorgeous.

13:59.172 --> 14:00.538
Gorgeous. Yes.

14:00.540 --> 14:02.207
Yes, Meg, gorgeous.

14:02.209 --> 14:04.008
Yes.
Every man wanted her.

14:04.010 --> 14:06.044
But one man got her.

14:06.046 --> 14:09.180
A man she trusted to keep her
safe and beautiful forever.

14:09.182 --> 14:10.949
That man was Glenn Quagmire.

14:10.951 --> 14:12.283
And two short months later,

14:12.285 --> 14:14.419
this is what happened
to Joan Van Ark.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.955
Oh! Oh, my God!

14:16.957 --> 14:18.790
I don't want this
to happen to you, Meg.

14:18.792 --> 14:20.959
I don't want you to turn
into a hilarious photograph.

14:20.961 --> 14:22.527
Dad, I know what
you're trying to do,

14:22.529 --> 14:24.028
and I wantu
to stop i.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.029
Mom!

14:25.031 --> 14:26.030
What is it, Meg?

14:26.032 --> 14:27.966
Mom, tell Dad
to leave me alone.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.201
I'm 18, and he keeps
treating me like a kid.

14:30.203 --> 14:33.705
Peter, I told you not to push
her about this Quagmire thing.

14:33.707 --> 14:36.941
If you push too hard,
you're going to push her
right into his arms.

14:36.943 --> 14:38.309
Well, what am I supposed to do?

14:38.311 --> 14:39.477
Nothing.

14:39.479 --> 14:40.879
This is a big game
Meg is playing,

14:40.881 --> 14:43.181
and the only way to win
is not to play it.

14:43.183 --> 14:45.850
Is that a <i>WarGames</i> reference?
Might be.

14:45.852 --> 14:48.186
You know <i>WarGames?</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

14:48.188 --> 14:49.988
Still finding out
new stuff about you.

14:49.990 --> 14:50.955
That's the adventure.

14:50.957 --> 14:52.257
There's a nerd in there.

14:52.259 --> 14:53.424
Maybe there is.

14:53.426 --> 14:54.759
I might bang her later.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.261
How about a nice
game of chess?

14:56.263 --> 14:57.462
I prefer banging.

14:57.464 --> 14:59.364
Dad, have you seen my book bag?

14:59.366 --> 15:01.266
What, Chris?
(screaming)

15:05.271 --> 15:06.704
Oh, Peter, there you are.

15:06.706 --> 15:08.973
Would you go tell Meg
that lunch is on the table?

15:08.975 --> 15:10.541
Oh, Meg's not here.
What do you mean?

15:10.543 --> 15:12.977
She and Quagmire went up
to his cabin for the weekend.
What?!

15:12.979 --> 15:14.946
Yeah, I drew you
a crude flip book

15:14.948 --> 15:16.281
to explain what's happening.

15:21.587 --> 15:23.288
Okay, I got
a little off track there,

15:23.290 --> 15:24.789
but they went to his cabin.

15:24.791 --> 15:27.325
Peter, Quagmire has
a name for that cabin.

15:27.327 --> 15:28.860
He calls it his sex cabin.

15:28.862 --> 15:30.929
No, he doesn't.
He calls it "The Stuffet Inn."

15:30.931 --> 15:32.997
Oh, my God, I can't believe
you knew about this

15:32.999 --> 15:33.932
and you let her go.

15:33.934 --> 15:35.266
Hey, don't give me that crap.

15:35.268 --> 15:36.935
I'm doing exactly
what you told me to do.

15:36.937 --> 15:39.003
You said don't mess with her
business, so I didn't.

15:39.005 --> 15:41.105
Peter, this is different.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.808
It's one thing to
rebelliously flaunt an older guy

15:43.810 --> 15:46.010
in front of your parents,
but it's a whole other thing

15:46.012 --> 15:48.713
to go away with him for the
weekend to his sex cabin.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.281
Oh, is that right?

15:50.283 --> 15:54.118
Oh, don't worry, Peter, he's
not going to sleep with her.

15:54.120 --> 15:56.087
That's you. Nerd.

15:56.089 --> 15:59.290
Look, everyone knows if you go
away with a guy for the weekend

15:59.292 --> 16:01.993
and don't have sex with him,
you're a huge bitch.

16:01.995 --> 16:03.261
We got to stop them.

16:03.263 --> 16:04.929
So you admit you were wrong.
Yes.

16:04.931 --> 16:06.998
You admit you were stupid.
Yes, yes.

16:07.000 --> 16:08.866
You admit all women are stupid.
No.

16:08.868 --> 16:10.468
All right, I'll take
what I can get.

16:10.470 --> 16:11.936
Come on.
To the Peter-dactyl.

16:13.305 --> 16:16.107
(screeching)

16:17.843 --> 16:19.377
(buzzing, crackling)

16:20.612 --> 16:23.915
Oh, no, now I got
to take care of the babies.

16:35.027 --> 16:37.829
Look, Peter,
his car's still there.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.197
Maybe they haven't left yet.

16:39.199 --> 16:42.433
Quagmire, let me in,
you son of a bitch.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.602
QUAGMIRE (recorded): I'm sorry
I'm not home to receive you.

16:44.604 --> 16:46.871
The reason being that you have
sufficiently scared me away

16:46.873 --> 16:48.373
from your wife or daughter.

16:48.375 --> 16:52.010
I plan to get help and use
better judgment in the future.

16:52.012 --> 16:53.644
Wait a minute, so Quagmire

16:53.646 --> 16:55.213
just changed all of a
sudden, just like that?

16:55.215 --> 16:56.748
You want me to read this or not?

16:56.750 --> 16:58.349
No, Grandpa, I don't.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.451
No kid wants to be read
anything anymore.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.954
Computers exist.
It's just you won't leave.

17:02.956 --> 17:05.823
Okay, where were we?
Quagmire's front door.

17:05.825 --> 17:07.425
You think they're
hiding in there?

17:07.427 --> 17:09.827
(engine revving)
Oh, no! Peter, look.

17:09.829 --> 17:12.030
See you later, suckers.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.101
Oh, good luck to them.
Peter!

17:17.103 --> 17:18.436
Oh, right, right.
Let's go.

17:21.006 --> 17:22.673
(tires squealing)

17:23.876 --> 17:25.943
(horns honking)

17:27.012 --> 17:29.781
We're never going
to get up there.

17:29.783 --> 17:31.582
I wonder what's causing
all this traffic.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.351
Oh, boy.
Yep, there's the problem.

17:33.353 --> 17:34.719
Not drawn yet.

17:37.823 --> 17:39.657
Come on, guys.
Really? Let's go.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.526
What the hell's
going on up there?

17:41.528 --> 17:43.594
(snoring)

17:44.797 --> 17:47.532
What...? Yep. Yep.

17:48.767 --> 17:51.002
(owl hooting)

17:52.938 --> 17:54.338
So tell the truth.

17:54.340 --> 17:56.340
Have you brought
other women up here before?

17:56.342 --> 17:58.609
Honestly? Two.
Really?

17:58.611 --> 18:01.546
Yep, I brought the ashes
of my third grade teacher,

18:01.548 --> 18:03.181
Mrs. Nicholson, and spread
them across the lake,

18:03.183 --> 18:04.649
per her last request.

18:04.651 --> 18:05.783
Oh.

18:05.785 --> 18:07.085
The other was some skag

18:07.087 --> 18:09.454
I met on a dock
four miles from here.
What?!

18:09.456 --> 18:12.023
(imitates buzzer)
Strike four, Jelly Jealouson.

18:12.025 --> 18:13.624
The other was my sister.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.626
(both laughing)

18:15.628 --> 18:17.929
(sighs)
It's so nice up here.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.864
I know.
I love the way the fire

18:19.866 --> 18:22.133
makes the shadows dance around
behind us.

18:22.135 --> 18:24.335
One time, my friends
and I went camping,

18:24.337 --> 18:26.637
and nobody could
start a campfire,

18:26.639 --> 18:29.674
and then I tried to start
the campfire, and I could.

18:29.676 --> 18:30.975
That's insane.

18:30.977 --> 18:32.710
Wha-- what is going on
over here?

18:32.712 --> 18:34.812
Wha-- are we taking
our shirts off now?

18:34.814 --> 18:36.180
Okay, follow the leader.

18:37.916 --> 18:39.951
Come on, Peter, hurry!

18:39.953 --> 18:41.152
Wait wait,
hold on, hold on, hold on.

18:41.154 --> 18:42.687
(loon calling)

18:42.689 --> 18:44.689
Listen to that.
It's a loon.

18:44.691 --> 18:45.957
That's beautiful.

18:45.959 --> 18:48.493
You know, we ought to get
a (bleep) cabin up here.

18:48.495 --> 18:50.595
Peter, we're wasting time.

18:50.597 --> 18:53.331
Quagmire's in there about to
have sex with our daughter.

18:53.333 --> 18:54.665
That son of a bitch.

18:54.667 --> 18:57.869
Let's-- wait-- w-wait
a minute, do you hear that?

18:57.871 --> 18:59.370
I don't hear anything.

18:59.372 --> 19:01.606
I know.
Isn't it bliss?

19:01.608 --> 19:03.040
Peter, let's go!

19:03.042 --> 19:05.710
Mm. Thanks for
the ice cream, Gle.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.145
And you're right, somehow

19:07.147 --> 19:08.513
it does taste better
in my underpants.

19:08.515 --> 19:10.181
Yeah, it's like being
at the beach, huh?

19:10.183 --> 19:12.483
Now get over here while
the inside of your mouth

19:12.485 --> 19:14.085
is still freezing cold.

19:15.521 --> 19:18.089
There you are,
you son of a bitch!

19:19.925 --> 19:21.859
You get away from
my daughter, you pervert!

19:21.861 --> 19:23.294
Meg, get in the car,
we're going home.

19:23.296 --> 19:24.862
I'm not going home!

19:24.864 --> 19:27.331
I'm 18, and you can't tell
me what to do anymore.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.100
Meg, I'm only going
to say this once.

19:29.102 --> 19:31.269
You may be an adult,
but you're still my daughter,

19:31.271 --> 19:33.437
and it's my job to protect
you from errant wieners.

19:33.439 --> 19:35.039
So, I don't care
how old you are,

19:35.041 --> 19:37.942
you're going to do what I say
and get in the damn car!

19:37.944 --> 19:40.111
Yes, Daddy.

19:43.582 --> 19:46.918
If you ever touch
my daughter again,

19:46.920 --> 19:50.621
I will cut your thing off
and feed it to Brian.
Okay.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.924
And Peter and I get this cabin
for one weekend a month.

19:52.926 --> 19:53.925
Do you understand me?

19:53.927 --> 19:55.026
Yes, ma'am.

19:55.028 --> 19:57.295
Peter, I got us the cabin.
Yay.

19:57.297 --> 19:59.430
I don't want to see your
face knocking on our door

19:59.432 --> 20:01.098
for at least a month.

20:01.100 --> 20:04.268
Would you sign the
guest book on your way out?

20:04.270 --> 20:07.004
Lois... Griffin.

20:07.006 --> 20:09.473
Peter... Griffin.

20:09.475 --> 20:12.577
We... heard... a loon.

20:15.747 --> 20:18.816
You know, Mom and Dad, I'm
really glad that you kept me

20:18.818 --> 20:20.351
from doing what
I was going to do.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.320
Well, that's what
parents are for, Meg.

20:22.322 --> 20:24.121
No matter what age you are.

20:24.123 --> 20:26.958
We love you and we just
never want to see you hurt.

20:26.960 --> 20:29.093
I only wish I'd seen
what was going on

20:29.095 --> 20:30.595
from the start,
like your father did.

20:30.597 --> 20:32.930
Well, I know the signs...

20:32.932 --> 20:35.032
because the same thing
happened to me.

20:35.034 --> 20:35.866
An older neighbor.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.935
Her name was Elaine.

20:37.937 --> 20:41.105
I was 18 and my body was firm
from push-ups and sit-ups.

20:41.107 --> 20:43.207
I was stunning.

20:43.209 --> 20:44.642
But while my body was mature,

20:44.644 --> 20:46.777
I had the mind of a 12-year-old.

20:46.779 --> 20:49.981
Elaine invited me over
with the promise of pie.

20:49.983 --> 20:51.582
Little did I know
this would lead

20:51.584 --> 20:54.785
to an eight-year-long
psychosexual entanglement.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.621
She's probably dead now.

20:56.623 --> 20:59.023
Life's funny sometimes.

20:59.025 --> 21:01.092
And... scene.

21:05.097 --> 21:09.166
