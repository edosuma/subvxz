00:03.270 --> 00:04.438
- Call me a bitch to my face.

00:04.505 --> 00:06.273
You won't do it,
'cause you're a little bitch.

00:06.340 --> 00:09.009
<i>- On a very special episode</i>
<i>of "The Bachelor."</i>

00:09.076 --> 00:10.844
- [bleep] you, Shanae.
- You are one of the most

00:10.911 --> 00:13.213
disgusting human beings I've
ever met in my entire life.

00:13.280 --> 00:15.582
- Talk to yourself.
- You are a narcissistic,

00:15.649 --> 00:17.551
gaslighting biotch.

00:17.618 --> 00:21.054
<i>- And it's nothing</i>
<i>like you've ever seen before.</i>

00:21.121 --> 00:22.756
- Nobody gave two hoots
about you having

00:22.823 --> 00:23.991
a [bleep] buddy on the side.

00:24.057 --> 00:25.425
- The [bleep] was good.

00:25.492 --> 00:27.427
I wasn't gonna cut it off
unless I was engaged, sorry.

00:27.494 --> 00:29.530
[all yelling]
- Oh, my God!

00:29.596 --> 00:31.131
<i>- And then...</i>

00:31.198 --> 00:32.699
- You're confusing love
and lust.

00:32.766 --> 00:34.268
<i>- Clayton is under fire...</i>

00:34.334 --> 00:36.904
- The person constantly
stirring the pot was you.

00:36.970 --> 00:39.406
<i>- Like no Bachelor</i>
<i>ever before.</i>

00:39.473 --> 00:41.875
- You're a liar.
- That was a slap in the face.

00:41.942 --> 00:44.745
- I wish you would sit there
and own it like a man.

00:44.811 --> 00:47.214
<i>- And don't miss</i>
<i>tomorrow night...</i>

00:47.281 --> 00:48.682
- I'm falling in love with you.

00:48.749 --> 00:52.319
<i>- When the shocking drama</i>
<i>in Iceland begins.</i>

00:52.386 --> 00:54.821
<i>- I'm falling in love</i>
<i>with all three of these women.</i>

00:54.888 --> 00:56.590
<i>- It's really hard,</i>
<i>because I don't know</i>

00:56.657 --> 00:58.058
<i>where he is</i>
<i>with everybody else.</i>

00:58.125 --> 00:59.459
<i>- I just don't want</i>
<i>to hurt anybody.</i>

01:01.395 --> 01:03.564
And I'm going to.

01:04.765 --> 01:06.733
<i>This is exactly</i>
<i>what I was afraid of.</i>

01:06.800 --> 01:07.801
<i>It's over.</i>

01:07.868 --> 01:09.136
<i>- But tonight,</i>

01:09.202 --> 01:10.571
<i>the women tell all.</i>

01:10.637 --> 01:12.472
- You're a walking red flag.

01:12.539 --> 01:13.674
- You continue to lie.

01:13.740 --> 01:15.142
- You can't talk
about people lying

01:15.208 --> 01:17.678
when you've lied
to the man you're gonna marry.

01:17.744 --> 01:19.746
- Whoops.
Sorry.

Thank you.
Thank you so much.

01:36.129 --> 01:38.231
Wow.

01:38.298 --> 01:39.600
Good evening, Bachelor Nation.

01:39.666 --> 01:41.969
It is so great
seeing all of you.

01:42.035 --> 01:45.339
I'm Jesse Palmer, and welcome
to "The Women Tell All."

01:45.405 --> 01:47.007
This is a two-night

01:47.074 --> 01:48.208
"Bachelor" event.

01:48.275 --> 01:49.309
That's right.

01:49.376 --> 01:51.044
Clayton's journey
is gonna continue

01:51.111 --> 01:52.412
tomorrow night in Iceland,

01:52.479 --> 01:54.514
but first we have
what promises to be

01:54.581 --> 01:57.718
a very revealing
and a very explosive evening.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.786
All your favorite women,
they're here tonight.

01:59.853 --> 02:01.421
[cheers]
That's right.

02:03.323 --> 02:04.358
They're all here.

02:04.424 --> 02:06.493
Even Shanae has joined us
tonight as well.

02:06.560 --> 02:07.928
[boos and jeers]

02:07.995 --> 02:10.030
And they're all ready
to get into all of it.

02:10.097 --> 02:12.099
Obviously, this was
my first season as host

02:12.165 --> 02:14.635
of "The Bachelor," and I was
just thrilled to join Clayton

02:14.701 --> 02:16.003
on his journey to find love.

02:16.069 --> 02:17.404
But I really don't think
any of us,

02:17.471 --> 02:20.207
especially Clayton himself,
could have anticipated

02:20.273 --> 02:23.043
the absolutely insane amount

02:23.110 --> 02:25.712
of chaos and controversy
that all went down.

02:25.779 --> 02:28.382
And by the way, if you think
you've seen it all,

02:28.448 --> 02:30.083
you ain't seen nothing yet.

02:30.150 --> 02:32.819
Later tonight, you're gonna
get an exclusive sneak peek

02:32.886 --> 02:38.258
at what I can confidently tell
you is the most dramatic finale

02:38.325 --> 02:40.694
in "Bachelor" history.

02:40.761 --> 02:43.530
That's right.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.198
That's right, I said it.

02:45.265 --> 02:46.967
But before we get
to any of that,

02:47.000 --> 02:48.902
there's a lot
of unfinished business.

02:48.969 --> 02:51.238
There's also a lot
of very opinionated women

02:51.304 --> 02:52.873
who just can't wait any longer.

02:52.939 --> 02:56.043
So what do you say?
You ready to kick it off?

02:56.109 --> 02:58.512
Should we get to it?

02:58.578 --> 03:00.981
All right.
Let's meet the women.

03:01.048 --> 03:05.485
Please welcome Claire,

03:05.552 --> 03:07.320
Kate,

03:07.387 --> 03:09.089
Hunter,

03:09.156 --> 03:10.557
Jill.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.359
Elizabeth is with us tonight.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.327
Say hello to Marlena,

03:14.394 --> 03:16.296
Cassidy,

03:16.363 --> 03:18.498
Kira,

03:18.565 --> 03:20.734
Eliza.

03:20.801 --> 03:23.570
Please welcome Shanae.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.605
Sarah's here.

03:25.672 --> 03:27.541
Lyndsey,

03:27.607 --> 03:29.743
Mara,

03:29.810 --> 03:32.012
Sierra's with us tonight.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.014
Say hello to Genevieve,

03:34.081 --> 03:35.248
Teddi,

03:35.315 --> 03:38.185
and Serene.

03:38.251 --> 03:41.021
It is so great
to see you all again.

03:41.088 --> 03:42.823
Thank you all so much
for coming out here tonight.

03:42.889 --> 03:45.025
I know we have so much
to get to,

03:45.092 --> 03:46.493
and I promise we're gonna get
to all of it.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.362
But first I want to go back
to that very first night.

03:49.429 --> 03:50.430
What was it like for you

03:50.497 --> 03:51.865
when you finally got
to meet Clayton?

03:51.932 --> 03:54.668
- As soon as I saw him,
I felt an instant connection,

03:54.735 --> 03:56.069
and I just felt like a peace

03:56.136 --> 03:57.938
of this is where
I was supposed to be.

03:58.004 --> 03:59.506
- I wasn't sure how
into Clayton I was gonna be

03:59.573 --> 04:02.809
right off the bat,
and I was immediately much more

04:02.876 --> 04:04.878
drawn to him than--
than I would have expected.

04:04.945 --> 04:06.346
So I thought it was kind of--

04:06.413 --> 04:08.482
you know,
kind of special in that way.

04:08.548 --> 04:10.851
- I mean, we all see him.
He looks very good.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.220
So that was a great start
for sure.

04:13.286 --> 04:15.155
- Well, listen.
I think we can all agree

04:15.222 --> 04:16.857
that Clayton's journey
to find love,

04:16.923 --> 04:19.226
it was definitely a wild one.

04:19.292 --> 04:22.529
There was just so many tears
and also so much drama.

04:22.596 --> 04:24.030
Take a look.

04:24.097 --> 04:26.266
<i>[rock music]</i>

04:26.333 --> 04:28.301
<i>- Clayton is everything</i>
<i>I've ever wanted.</i>

04:28.368 --> 04:30.036
all: Clayton!

04:30.103 --> 04:32.239
<i>- Clayton is super handsome.</i>

04:32.305 --> 04:34.674
<i>- He's humble.</i>
<i>He's great at communication.</i>

04:34.741 --> 04:36.843
- Oh!
<i>- He's muscular.</i>

04:36.910 --> 04:40.147
<i>He has a great smile.</i>
<i>- He is so handsome.</i>

04:40.213 --> 04:43.183
And all these women are
fighting for Clayton.

04:43.250 --> 04:44.651
- Did you talk to him?

04:44.718 --> 04:46.486
- Yeah, I hated him.
- Wait, what?

04:46.553 --> 04:48.655
- I would eat him
and spit him out.

04:48.722 --> 04:51.024
- It's the first night,
and I'm so shocked

04:51.091 --> 04:53.360
at how Claire is
behaving right now.

04:53.426 --> 04:56.329
- I can't be with, like,
America's sweetheart.

04:56.396 --> 04:58.131
I hate him.
I don't know.

04:58.198 --> 05:01.802
<i>- Claire yelling</i>
<i>that she hates Clayton,</i>

05:01.868 --> 05:03.270
that just shows her character

05:03.336 --> 05:05.138
and it shows
that she's unhinged.

05:05.205 --> 05:06.940
- No.
- What?

05:07.007 --> 05:08.642
<i>Okay, you two were not</i>
<i>compatible, you didn't click.</i>

05:08.708 --> 05:11.645
Let bygones be bygones
and, like, bye, be gone.

05:11.711 --> 05:13.814
<i>- Like, if that's</i>
<i>how you feel, then go home.</i>

05:13.880 --> 05:15.715
<i>All of us are stoked</i>
<i>on Clayton.</i>

05:15.782 --> 05:17.284
<i>- I'm here</i>
<i>to build a relationship,</i>

05:17.350 --> 05:19.986
and I'm gonna do whatever
I gotta do to get it.

05:20.053 --> 05:22.055
- Where's Clayton?
- Where is Clayton?

05:22.122 --> 05:24.191
- I think he's still with,
like, Cassidy.

05:24.257 --> 05:26.493
I'm, like, so annoyed.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.662
<i>- Cassidy doesn't care</i>
<i>what anyone thinks.</i>

05:28.728 --> 05:30.197
It's disrespectful.

05:30.263 --> 05:32.199
And I would gladly tell her
that right to her face.

05:32.265 --> 05:33.700
- I'm simply not
gonna apologize

05:33.767 --> 05:35.001
for not hanging
enough streamers.

05:35.068 --> 05:37.070
- Why are you making
it sound like that, Cassidy?

05:37.137 --> 05:38.738
It's not hanging
enough streamers.

05:38.805 --> 05:40.073
- I think that
the criticism that I didn't

05:40.140 --> 05:42.142
pull my weight at a birthday
party is a little silly.

05:42.209 --> 05:44.377
<i>They're threatened by me,</i>
<i>and they should be.</i>

05:45.612 --> 05:46.780
- Like victory.

05:46.847 --> 05:48.682
Who has the rose, bitches?

05:48.748 --> 05:50.183
I didn't think so.

05:50.250 --> 05:52.185
<i>- Cassidy,</i>
<i>she's playing a game.</i>

05:52.252 --> 05:54.287
She ain't good.
She a little snake.

05:54.354 --> 05:57.824
Cassidy, she has
a friends with benefits,

05:57.891 --> 06:02.162
and she was FaceTiming him
right before she met you.

06:02.229 --> 06:04.664
- Were you seeing someone
up until the point

06:04.731 --> 06:06.800
that you came here?

06:06.867 --> 06:10.036
- No.
I haven't--absolutely not.

06:10.103 --> 06:11.872
<i>- Cassidy was aggressive,</i>

06:11.938 --> 06:14.441
but, like,
Shanae is Cassidy 2.0.

06:14.507 --> 06:16.109
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

06:16.176 --> 06:17.677

06:19.713 --> 06:21.248
<i>These women better watch out.</i>

06:21.314 --> 06:22.816
<i>Don't get in my way,</i>
<i>because I'm here.</i>

06:22.883 --> 06:24.251
I'm here to [bleep] win.

06:24.317 --> 06:26.019
There are red flags
in the house.

06:26.086 --> 06:28.388
Elizabeth, she's two-faced.

06:28.455 --> 06:30.590
And I just don't know if she's
here for the right reasons.

06:30.657 --> 06:33.727
- You just came to the guy
that I'm trying to get to know

06:33.793 --> 06:36.863
and told him that I was
two-faced and had a red flag.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.299
<i>Every time</i>
<i>Shanae opens her mouth,</i>

06:39.366 --> 06:41.268
<i>it seems to be a worse</i>
<i>and worse version of her.</i>

06:41.334 --> 06:42.869
It's disgusting at this point.

06:42.936 --> 06:45.138
- Ladies,
you want a piece of shrimp?

06:45.205 --> 06:47.207
No one could even look back
and acknowledge me.

06:47.274 --> 06:49.409
<i>Elizabeth clearly saw me</i>
<i>walk up, and you can hear</i>

06:49.476 --> 06:51.144
my voice when I say,
"Do you want some shrimp?"

06:51.211 --> 06:52.812
You don't acknowledge me.
- I wasn't outside

06:52.879 --> 06:54.047
when you offered people shrimp.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.482
- Elizabeth,
you were in the hot tub.

06:55.548 --> 06:57.350
- I was in the hot tub once,
and it wasn't that day.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.319
- You're toxic.
You're fake to me.

06:59.386 --> 07:00.387
And you're lying.

07:00.453 --> 07:02.923
Get out, you lying whore.

07:04.824 --> 07:06.359
[ohhing]

07:06.426 --> 07:07.761

07:07.827 --> 07:10.063
this is not somebody
you would want to marry.

07:10.130 --> 07:11.598
- She just can't get along,

07:11.665 --> 07:16.269
and she's lied, and she can't
apologize for what she's done.

07:16.336 --> 07:18.004
What the [bleep]
are you doing here?

07:18.071 --> 07:20.674
- Genevieve and Sierra,
keep my name

07:20.740 --> 07:23.009
out of your [bleep] mouths.

07:23.076 --> 07:25.312
- Why are you here?
- Why did she even come here?

07:26.980 --> 07:29.349
- Your actions
are very hard to defend.

07:29.416 --> 07:30.684
Do you feel apologetic for it?

07:30.750 --> 07:32.085
- No, I want to apologize.

07:32.152 --> 07:33.620
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

07:33.687 --> 07:36.189
If anyone deserves an apology
here, it's [bleep] me.

- I really appreciate it.
- How'd your conversation go?

07:38.458 --> 07:40.927

I'm just regretting my actions.

And I am really sorry.

I'm not sorry, hos.

<i>Give me the Emmy.</i>

08:22.102 --> 08:23.737
<i>- I'm not sorry to mean girls.</i>

08:23.803 --> 08:26.039
Sorry, but not sorry, bitches.

08:26.106 --> 08:29.142
[cheers and applause]

08:35.749 --> 08:37.851
- Shanae, did somebody
lock you in the closet

08:37.917 --> 08:39.452
when you were a little kid?

08:39.519 --> 08:41.654
- No, honey.
- Like, what the hell?

08:41.721 --> 08:43.957
- 'Cause what was that?
That was pretty dark.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.692
- Sorry.
You guys were all fake, sorry.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.327
- Girl, we're fake?
- We were fake?

08:47.394 --> 08:48.561
- We're fake?

08:48.628 --> 08:50.296
- You played Clayton.
- I played Clayton?

08:50.363 --> 08:51.931
- Yes, you played Clayton!

08:51.998 --> 08:53.500
- You all played Clayton.

08:53.566 --> 08:54.968
You weren't there
for the right reason.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.803
You weren't there,
and you weren't there.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.204
- She's crazy.

08:58.271 --> 08:59.806
- You said, "I didn't need
to cry, but I cried."

08:59.873 --> 09:01.107
- You're not gonna apologize?
- No.

09:01.174 --> 09:02.308
- Who am I gonna get?
- Talk to yourself.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.576
- Am I gonna get Shanae,
or am I gonna get

09:03.643 --> 09:05.445
a budget-ass
[bleep] Meryl Streep?

09:05.512 --> 09:07.147
- Hey, I'm not sure yet.

09:07.213 --> 09:09.949
He asked for openness, honesty,
and vulnerability,

09:10.016 --> 09:11.751
and I gave him all three.

09:11.818 --> 09:12.986
- Did you fake an apology?

09:13.053 --> 09:14.421
Did you fake an apology?
- I faked an apology.

09:14.487 --> 09:17.090
He asked me to apologize.
I did it for him, not you guys.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.291
- Okay,
so you faked an apology,

09:18.358 --> 09:19.659
and you told him you apologized

09:19.726 --> 09:21.127
and that you meant it
and that you wanted to.

09:21.194 --> 09:22.328
You lied to his face.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.696
And on another note,
I'm just gonna say,

09:23.763 --> 09:26.933
I love how you can call us all
bitches behind a screen.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.535
Call me a bitch
to my [bleep] face.

09:28.601 --> 09:29.869
[cheers and applause]

09:29.936 --> 09:32.472
Call all of us bitches.
You won't do it.

09:32.539 --> 09:34.607
'Cause you're a little bitch.
- All right. All right.

09:34.674 --> 09:36.076
- You are a little-ass bitch.
- All right, take a second--

09:36.142 --> 09:37.310
- And you're lying
behind a screen.

09:37.377 --> 09:38.845
- Thank you.
- You're a fake crier.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.280
You're fake.
- All right.

09:40.346 --> 09:41.815
Sierra, Shanae,
let's take a second.

09:41.881 --> 09:43.650
Take a breath.
We've only just begun.

09:43.716 --> 09:46.152
We're gonna be here a while.
[laughter]

09:46.219 --> 09:48.688
Look, I know we barely
just scratched the surface

09:48.755 --> 09:50.256
with all the drama with Shanae,

09:50.323 --> 09:51.825
and we're gonna
have a lot of time

09:51.891 --> 09:53.059
to get to that a bit later.

09:53.126 --> 09:55.428
But I do want to go back
to the very beginning,

09:55.495 --> 09:56.696
and Claire,
I want to start with you.

09:56.763 --> 09:58.832
There have literally
been hundreds of women

09:58.898 --> 10:00.166
that have gotten out
of the limo.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.235
You might be the first ever
to have literally

10:02.302 --> 10:04.304
one conversation
with our Bachelor

10:04.370 --> 10:07.107
and go, nope, not for me.

10:07.173 --> 10:08.508
- Yeah.
- So what happened?

10:08.575 --> 10:10.877
- You know, the second
I got out of the limo,

10:10.944 --> 10:12.378
my first conversation with him,

10:12.445 --> 10:14.714
he was entirely too soft
for me.

10:14.781 --> 10:16.983
I need a person
that has some edge to them

10:17.050 --> 10:18.284
that can handle me.

10:18.351 --> 10:20.019
He was not for me.

10:20.086 --> 10:22.155
- But I didn't think
that it was necessary

10:22.222 --> 10:24.324
for you to [bleep] talk him

10:24.390 --> 10:27.327
and to sort of make
our relationship with him

10:27.393 --> 10:28.928
start off on a bad foot.

10:28.995 --> 10:31.131
- The issue was,

10:31.197 --> 10:32.866
when you kept on telling us
you're about to leave,

10:32.932 --> 10:34.267
you're about to leave,
you're about to leave,

10:34.334 --> 10:36.503
I would go someplace else,
come back, you still here.

10:36.569 --> 10:38.338
- Agreed. Agreed. Agreed.
- You know, like--

10:38.404 --> 10:39.973
- All right.
So you know what, I'll--

10:40.039 --> 10:41.574
I will--I will honest to God

10:41.641 --> 10:42.976
say this, I was bored.

10:43.042 --> 10:44.310
So guess what I did.

10:44.377 --> 10:45.979
I went
and I found myself the bar.

10:46.045 --> 10:49.115
And I'm one of those people,
when I know, I know,

10:49.182 --> 10:51.651
and when I don't feel it,
it's never gonna come.

10:51.718 --> 10:54.087
So why waste my time?

10:54.154 --> 10:55.455
- Cassidy, on the other hand,

10:55.522 --> 10:59.692
you really fought for as much
one-on-one romantic time

10:59.759 --> 11:00.994
as you could get
with Clayton very early on.

11:01.060 --> 11:02.195
- As much screen time?
Is that what you said?

11:02.262 --> 11:03.463
- All the time.
- Oh.

11:03.530 --> 11:04.764
- All right, well,
when you think back to it,

11:04.831 --> 11:06.966
why did you choose
such an assertive approach?

11:07.033 --> 11:08.268
- 'Cause she was
playing a game.

11:08.334 --> 11:09.702
- I am just very forward.

11:09.769 --> 11:11.804
I'm a very forward,
assertive person

11:11.871 --> 11:13.406
in my normal life,
in my day-to-day life.

11:13.473 --> 11:14.674
Anyone who knows me
will tell you that--

11:14.741 --> 11:16.042
- You're not forward.
You're disrespectful.

11:16.109 --> 11:18.711
You were disrespectful
to the girls and to Clayton.

11:18.778 --> 11:21.381
Just, like, the way
she was going around the house

11:21.447 --> 11:23.316
trying to intimidate
some of the other girls,

11:23.383 --> 11:25.351
I thought that this was a game

11:25.418 --> 11:27.687
and that she really
wasn't into Clayton.

11:27.754 --> 11:29.122
- Okay--
- That's what you were,

11:29.189 --> 11:30.356
not forward.

11:30.423 --> 11:32.258
- I wasn't disrespectful
to anybody.

11:32.325 --> 11:34.260
Um, I minded my business.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.296
I was just going for the guy
that I was into

11:36.362 --> 11:38.198
and trying my hardest
to stand out in the crowd,

11:38.264 --> 11:39.999
and you know, I, pshh,

11:40.066 --> 11:41.634
I certainly didn't do it
perfectly.

11:41.701 --> 11:43.736
It was my first time, so--
- Clearly.

11:43.803 --> 11:45.338
- You knew
what you were doing though.

11:45.405 --> 11:46.506
- You knew what you were doing,
sis.

11:46.573 --> 11:47.774
- Right, you're conniving.
- You knew.

11:47.840 --> 11:48.975
You're just--you're--
- Just, like, own it.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.210
- You're very confident
in who you are.

11:50.276 --> 11:51.611
- I-I feel like
I am owning it.

11:51.678 --> 11:53.580
- You have a high ego,
but you were a little arrogant

11:53.646 --> 11:55.081
walking around the house
at times.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.616
You are abrasive
when you talk sometimes.

11:56.683 --> 11:58.284
- Well, in terms of my
arrogance, I didn't realize

11:58.351 --> 12:00.119
how much I was rubbing
everyone the wrong way.

12:00.186 --> 12:02.722
- I never felt so small
in a room with Cassidy.

12:02.789 --> 12:03.923
Even when you had the rose,

12:03.990 --> 12:05.291
do you remember in the room
when I said,

12:05.358 --> 12:07.393
"I think you should maybe
take it back a little bit?"

12:07.460 --> 12:09.329
Because it was
making me uncomfortable.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.331
- Sorry, like,
did you even know Clayton?

12:11.397 --> 12:13.433
Because you spoke,
like, two words to him,

12:13.499 --> 12:15.668
and the rest of the time
you were sucking face with him.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.470
Seriously.
- I mean, that's how I approach

12:17.537 --> 12:18.871
dating in the normal world,
right?

12:18.938 --> 12:21.107
I see if there's chemistry,
see if there's a spark,

12:21.174 --> 12:23.476
see if you're a good kisser,
and then--

12:23.543 --> 12:25.178
then where you're from,
you know what I mean?

12:25.245 --> 12:27.547
- How has that
worked out for you, Cassidy?

12:27.614 --> 12:29.115
- Nothing wrong with it.
- Not well.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.684
I got sent home
in week two, so...

12:31.751 --> 12:33.553
- Nobody's faulting you
for, like,

12:33.620 --> 12:35.255
"I'm here for Clayton,
not to make friends."

12:35.321 --> 12:36.489
Like, it's so typical,
whatever.

12:36.556 --> 12:38.024
But you can't
disrespect the girls--

12:38.091 --> 12:40.026
- I feel like it's unfair to,
like, continue

12:40.093 --> 12:42.362
to harp on the fact that I was
disrespectful to the girls,

12:42.428 --> 12:44.063
because unlike a lot of you

12:44.130 --> 12:45.598
who aren't getting
the same accusation,

12:45.665 --> 12:48.001
I didn't have a negative word
to say about anybody

12:48.067 --> 12:49.469
in any of my interviews,

12:49.535 --> 12:52.038
except, like, the generic,
"Game on, bitches,"

12:52.105 --> 12:53.473
but, like, that was more of

12:53.539 --> 12:55.108
a term of endearment
in that setting.

12:55.174 --> 12:56.709
- What about--you called her
a bitch in the kitchen.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.411
You were like, "Move, bitch."

12:58.478 --> 13:00.847
And then you--
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

13:00.913 --> 13:02.282
Saying, "Move, bitch" to--

13:02.348 --> 13:03.549
- That was not
endearing either.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.817
You were like,
"It's a thing of endearment."

13:04.884 --> 13:06.219
- It wasn't--it wasn't--
- That's not endearing.

13:06.286 --> 13:07.253
- Yeah,
but you were disrespectful.

13:07.320 --> 13:08.554
- When you met me,

13:08.621 --> 13:10.590
you told me that you would
instantly forget my name

13:10.657 --> 13:12.659
because I look
like everybody else here.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.227
- That's not true. You know it.
- No, it is true!

13:14.294 --> 13:15.361
- That's not true. You know it.
- It is true.

13:15.428 --> 13:16.896
- You were dropping bombs
that whole night.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.865
You were dropping bombs--
- Okay, on that note--

13:18.931 --> 13:21.134
- There were a lot of things--
- You were very boastful.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.468
- Guys, on that note--
[overlapping chatter]

13:22.535 --> 13:24.370
- In everyone's face with it--
- Rose--

13:24.437 --> 13:26.172
- If you're gonna do all that,
you might as well own it.

13:26.239 --> 13:27.507
- It's not confidence.
- It's all about respect.

13:27.573 --> 13:28.975
It's about respect.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.410
- All right, listen.
I'm really sorry to do this.

13:30.476 --> 13:31.678
I know we have
so much to cover.

13:31.744 --> 13:32.945
We are gonna get to all of it.

13:33.012 --> 13:35.014
But we do have
to take a short break.

13:35.081 --> 13:37.717
We'll be right back
with "The Women Tell All."

13:37.784 --> 13:40.586
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

13:40.653 --> 13:42.488
<i>♪ ♪</i>

13:44.257 --> 13:45.358
- There's one guy
that I have been

13:45.425 --> 13:46.693
hooking up with on and off
for a while.

13:46.759 --> 13:47.994
He's a few years younger.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.929
He FaceTimed me
while I was at the hotel.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.231
I told him I was about
to leave for filming,

13:52.298 --> 13:54.033
I couldn't tell him what for,
blah, blah, blah.

13:54.100 --> 13:56.536
Oh, my God.
On that FaceTime, he was like,

13:56.602 --> 13:57.970
"Well, whatever the show
it is you're on,

13:58.037 --> 13:59.339
"like, I can't wait
for you to get back.

13:59.405 --> 14:01.808
Let's watch it together and,
you know, if there was--"

Hi.
- Hey.

14:03.142 --> 14:04.544
<i>Yeah.</i>
<i>- I don't know. It was--</i>

14:04.610 --> 14:06.279
<i>it was validating</i>
<i>to hear that from him.</i>

14:06.346 --> 14:09.382
[cheers and applause]

14:12.185 --> 14:14.087
- Welcome back
to "The Women Tell All."

14:14.153 --> 14:16.756
So ladies, the tension,
it really seemed like

14:16.823 --> 14:19.726
things were boiling over
by the second Rose Ceremony.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.194
And Sierra, we just watched

14:21.260 --> 14:23.863
a very revealing conversation
with Cassidy

14:23.930 --> 14:25.998
before
that second cocktail party.

14:26.065 --> 14:28.334
What did she say to you
that was so alarming

14:28.401 --> 14:29.602
and gave you concern?

14:29.669 --> 14:32.872
- Her and I talked,
and she basically told me

14:32.939 --> 14:36.008
that she was
FaceTiming her friend

14:36.075 --> 14:39.445
in the hotel room
before she met up with Clayton,

14:39.512 --> 14:40.980
before we got into limos
and everything.

14:41.047 --> 14:44.350
And he talked to her,
saying how he wanted

14:44.417 --> 14:46.552
to watch the show with her
when she got back,

14:46.619 --> 14:48.454
that it would be cuddling
season, and he wanted to do

14:48.521 --> 14:50.590
all these "nasty things"
with her--her words.

14:50.656 --> 14:52.325
- But we all saw
the conversation,

14:52.392 --> 14:53.626
and that never happened.

14:53.693 --> 14:54.961
- No, it did.

14:55.027 --> 14:57.430
He said nasty things.
He wanted to do

14:57.497 --> 14:58.931
"nasty things" with you.

14:58.998 --> 15:00.733
I will look you in your eye
and say that you said it,

15:00.800 --> 15:02.001
because I know I'm not a liar.

15:02.068 --> 15:05.338
He said nasty things to you.
Your words, okay?

15:05.405 --> 15:07.840
Don't call me a liar, 'cause
I know damn well I'm not.

15:07.907 --> 15:10.777
- This was not a game to me,
and I actually liked Clayton.

15:10.843 --> 15:13.613
And it--it really hurt to see--

15:13.679 --> 15:15.515
you know,
it didn't seem like you ever

15:15.581 --> 15:17.216
really had a connection
with him.

15:17.283 --> 15:19.051
And, like, you were willing
to throw me under the bus.

15:19.118 --> 15:20.453
- But you don't know. You don't
know the conversations I have.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.988
You don't know the conv--

15:22.054 --> 15:23.356
- But you didn't know
the conversations we had--

15:23.423 --> 15:26.793
- I got to talk to Clayton
every single night.

15:26.859 --> 15:28.294
Obviously, I can't--

15:28.361 --> 15:29.996
it's not gonna happen
like this, instantly.

15:30.062 --> 15:31.497
I'm not gonna make out
with someone instantly.

15:31.564 --> 15:33.266
I'm not going to go out and
pounce on somebody instantly.

15:33.332 --> 15:34.667
I have to grow over time--
- What you said and what

15:34.734 --> 15:36.569
you did made it seem like
the problem was...

15:36.636 --> 15:38.438
- And that's what I need to do.
- That I had a guy on the side.

15:38.504 --> 15:40.406
And I didn't have a boyfriend.
- Nobody--

15:40.473 --> 15:42.642
- I didn't have a relationship.
- That's the thing.

15:42.708 --> 15:44.510
It's like nobody gave two
hoots about you having, like,

15:44.577 --> 15:45.678
a [bleep] buddy on the side.

15:45.745 --> 15:46.879
It was the fact
that you had plans...

15:46.946 --> 15:48.181
- You had plans after.

15:48.247 --> 15:49.582
You had the after plans.

15:49.649 --> 15:50.883
- I never said that.
- And that's--

15:50.950 --> 15:52.885
- Why would I cut off
casual sex

15:52.952 --> 15:55.988
for a man I have literally
never heard speak before?

15:56.055 --> 15:58.024
No matter how you try and spin
it or say which part of it

15:58.090 --> 16:00.827
was the problem, the root of
the problem that got us there

16:00.893 --> 16:03.563
was that someone thought it was
wrong that I had casual sex

16:03.629 --> 16:05.698
with someone before coming
on "The Bachelor."

16:05.765 --> 16:08.401
And I just hate
that we're still there.

16:08.468 --> 16:09.902
You know what I mean?
Because--

16:09.969 --> 16:11.838
- It was the fact that you were
having sex with him prior.

16:11.904 --> 16:13.773
It was the fact
that you left him on a tangent,

16:13.840 --> 16:16.943
being like, I'll come back
for you after the show.

16:17.009 --> 16:18.744
That's where
the problem was lying.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.646
- But--
- Because for Clayton,

16:20.713 --> 16:22.482
he's expecting to find a wife,

16:22.548 --> 16:25.251
not somebody who put somebody
on hold for a second.

16:25.318 --> 16:26.886
- Trust me,
if Clayton had proposed to me,

16:26.953 --> 16:28.888
the phone call would have been,
"Hey, I know--

16:28.955 --> 16:30.256
"that show I couldn't
tell you I was going on,

16:30.323 --> 16:31.757
"it was 'The Bachelor'
and I fell in love.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.259
Good luck. Talk to you later."
- There shouldn't have been

16:33.326 --> 16:34.760
a phone call, regardless...
- Talk to you never, whatever.

16:34.827 --> 16:35.761
- Is the problem.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.763
So we all watched
you walk out--

16:37.830 --> 16:39.532
- The [bleep] was good.
I wasn't gonna cut it off

16:39.599 --> 16:42.034
unless I was engaged, sorry.

16:42.101 --> 16:43.202
- So he wasn't
just a friend then.

16:43.269 --> 16:44.804
- So nasty things.

16:44.871 --> 16:45.905
- So he wasn't
just a friend then.

16:45.972 --> 16:47.440
So you just--so you literally--

16:47.507 --> 16:49.375
- If that was so good,
then you shouldn't have come

16:49.442 --> 16:52.144
on a show to get engaged
to somebody else.

16:52.211 --> 16:53.479
- If it's that important,
you're clearly not ready

16:53.546 --> 16:54.747
to, like, settle down--
- Well, it's a good thing

16:54.814 --> 16:56.249
I'm not anyone's fiancée then,
I guess, huh?

16:56.315 --> 16:57.917
- It is.
- Well, thank God.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.352
- I have a hot take.

16:59.418 --> 17:01.721
I personally don't think
it's that unforgivable

17:01.787 --> 17:03.589
to have somebody on the side.

17:03.656 --> 17:06.759
To me, the worst offense
that you did was coach Shanae

17:06.826 --> 17:08.394
and turn that bitch
into Frankenstein.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.763
[laughter]
- That's very true.

17:10.830 --> 17:13.466
- Kate, when did you first know

17:13.533 --> 17:16.402
that there was going to be an
issue in the house with Shanae?

17:16.469 --> 17:19.205
- Shanae, to be honest, when
I met you, I really liked you.

17:19.272 --> 17:23.276
But then, as soon as
you decimated that group date

17:23.342 --> 17:25.478
and robbed me
of my time with Clayton,

17:25.545 --> 17:27.780
and consequently,
I go home the next day,

17:27.847 --> 17:29.248
the switch was flipped for me.

17:29.315 --> 17:32.385
It literally felt like
underneath that façade

17:32.451 --> 17:36.489
was this, like,
sinister, diabolical bitch.

17:36.556 --> 17:38.491
- Yep.
- I feel like, Shanae,

17:38.558 --> 17:41.394
like, being around you
was a lose-lose situation.

17:41.460 --> 17:43.763
Like,
we could be polite to you,

17:43.829 --> 17:45.665
and if we were polite and,
like, nice,

17:45.731 --> 17:47.466
then we were two-faced bitches.

17:47.533 --> 17:49.835
But if I distanced myself
from you,

17:49.902 --> 17:51.871
then we were bullies.

17:51.938 --> 17:53.940
And it's like,
watching it all back,

17:54.006 --> 17:56.309
I now realize,
like, you're the bully,

17:56.375 --> 17:58.477
and from the bottom
of my heart,

17:58.544 --> 18:00.379
[bleep] you, Shanae.

18:00.446 --> 18:02.181
- Really?
- Like, you can go

18:02.248 --> 18:03.950
rot in Ohio, for all I care.

18:04.016 --> 18:06.218
Like, you are dirt.
- Literally, rot.

18:06.285 --> 18:07.687
- Shanae,
you are one of the most

18:07.753 --> 18:08.988
disgusting human beings I've
ever met in my entire life.

18:09.055 --> 18:11.791
- Hunter, where was
this energy in the house?

18:11.857 --> 18:14.794
[all yelling]

18:14.860 --> 18:17.597
- Shanae, okay,
where was your personality?

18:17.663 --> 18:19.065
- It matters. It matters.
- Where was your personality?

18:19.131 --> 18:21.901
- Yeah, where was your energy--
[overlapping shouting]

18:21.968 --> 18:24.604
- To our faces.
[applause]

18:24.670 --> 18:26.472
- Literally--
- Shanae.

18:26.539 --> 18:29.942
Where was the honesty to our
faces calling us bitches?

18:30.009 --> 18:31.243
- Right, like--
- Remember,

18:31.310 --> 18:32.845
I was isolating myself.
- You called us hos.

18:32.912 --> 18:34.480
- Remember that?
- No, you were hiding

18:34.547 --> 18:36.082
in your room
away from everybody.

18:36.148 --> 18:37.249
- I wasn't hiding
from you guys.

18:37.316 --> 18:38.384
I was not hiding.
- And whenever you were

18:38.451 --> 18:39.719
with us, you never once spoke.

18:39.785 --> 18:41.520
You never talked.
You sat there--

18:41.587 --> 18:42.655
- I wasn't there for besties.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.223
- All right, all right.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.758
All right, listen.
- Talk mad [bleep],

18:45.825 --> 18:48.561
went to Clayton and started
crying like a little bitch.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.129
- Clayton asked me what was
wrong and I told him the truth.

18:50.196 --> 18:51.897
- All right, everyone, listen.
Listen real quick.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.065
It's obviously hard, Shanae,

18:53.132 --> 18:54.400
for you right now
to get a word in,

18:54.467 --> 18:55.835
so I want to give you
an opportunity to do that.

18:55.901 --> 18:58.137
Obviously, you were at the
center of a lot of the drama.

18:58.204 --> 18:59.505
I think it's time
we have a little chat.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.374
Why don't you come up
and join me in the hot seat.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.242
- Absolutely.

19:06.278 --> 19:07.480
- So great seeing you.

19:07.546 --> 19:09.749
- Her ass looks terrible.
- What is that outfit?

19:09.815 --> 19:12.251
- Are you wearing a diaper?

19:12.318 --> 19:14.120
- All right. I know
this is a bit tough for you.

19:14.186 --> 19:16.155
- A little bit.
- How you feeling?

19:16.222 --> 19:17.657
- [exhales] It's a lot.

19:17.723 --> 19:19.025
- She's gonna fake cry.

19:19.091 --> 19:20.092
Fake cry.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.961
- Crocodile tears.
- Fake cry!

19:22.028 --> 19:23.396
[heckling continues]
- Yeah. It's a lot.

19:23.462 --> 19:24.830
I mean--
- Meryl.

19:24.897 --> 19:25.865
- You knew this day was coming.

19:25.931 --> 19:27.600
- Yep.
- You knew you'd be here,

19:27.667 --> 19:29.902
and you'd have
to face everybody.

19:29.969 --> 19:31.303
- Yeah, I mean, it's hard.

19:31.370 --> 19:32.938
- You have to, like--
you made your bed though.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.373
You have to, like, lay in it.
- You have to own up

19:34.440 --> 19:35.741
to your mistakes.
- Take accountability.

19:35.808 --> 19:37.810
- You literally made up
all of these stories

19:37.877 --> 19:39.145
in your mind
and told Clayton.

19:39.211 --> 19:40.346
- Oh, I forgot.
'Cause you sit in my

19:40.413 --> 19:41.814
back pocket and you
hear everything.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.282
- Lyndsey's a bully,
Rachel's a bully.

19:43.349 --> 19:45.618
You made up all these lies,
and then you're complaining.

19:45.685 --> 19:48.120
And then we see you
on TV running your mouth.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.588
- What haven't we seen that--

19:49.655 --> 19:51.357
you said there's more to the
story that we haven't seen--

19:51.424 --> 19:52.591
- Well, you're fake.

19:52.658 --> 19:53.726
You didn't have a connection
with Clayton.

19:53.793 --> 19:55.294
What else?
- That--that's--

19:55.361 --> 19:56.796
that's what your story is?
- Who cares?

19:56.862 --> 19:58.197
- What is fake?
- That's the rest of the story?

19:58.264 --> 19:59.765
- Where's the fakeness?
- Good job, Shanae.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.967
- You're 100% fake, Genevieve.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.236
- Okay, guys, here's--
here's what we're gonna do.

20:04.303 --> 20:06.072
Listen.
We're gonna go back,

20:06.138 --> 20:07.606
and we're gonna revisit
some of what happened.

20:07.673 --> 20:08.607
I do want to give you a chance

20:08.674 --> 20:10.209
to address that
after the break.

20:10.276 --> 20:11.544
We have more with Shanae

20:11.610 --> 20:13.446
when "The Bachelor:
The Women Tell All" returns.

20:13.512 --> 20:16.449
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

20:16.515 --> 20:22.088
<i>♪ ♪</i>

20:24.123 --> 20:25.791
- In the house,
you make me uncomfortable.

20:25.858 --> 20:28.060
You're toxic.
You're fake to me.

20:28.127 --> 20:30.229
I walk past you, half the time
you don't talk to me.

20:30.296 --> 20:32.665
And you have all these girls
turning against me

20:32.732 --> 20:33.999
because of you.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.534
The lying, the bullying--

20:35.601 --> 20:37.036
everything you can think of.

20:37.103 --> 20:39.772
- Can you define a circumstance
of bullying?

20:39.839 --> 20:41.407
- You made shrimp
the other day, right?

20:41.474 --> 20:42.708
You asked if I wanted some.

20:42.775 --> 20:43.976
I was like, wow,
she's being really nice.

20:44.043 --> 20:45.344
I'm gonna take some shrimp.

20:45.411 --> 20:46.712
Me and Eliza make some shrimp,
and I'm like,

20:46.779 --> 20:48.347
hey, let me exchange the offer.

20:48.414 --> 20:51.283
Let me see if these girls in
the hot tub want some shrimp.

20:51.350 --> 20:54.887
I do so, I go out.
No one even turns to say--

20:54.954 --> 20:56.422
- Does this sound
like bullying to you?

20:56.489 --> 20:58.424
- Please, Elizabeth.
No one turns back

20:58.491 --> 21:00.659
to even say just,
Shanae, no thank you.

21:00.726 --> 21:02.595
- Why is that
my responsibility?

21:02.661 --> 21:03.829
- I don't like it.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.397
I don't like
how the girls are treating me.

21:05.464 --> 21:07.099
You're not nice.

21:07.166 --> 21:08.434
- I have been nothing but kind

21:08.501 --> 21:09.568
and respectful to you
in the house.

21:09.635 --> 21:10.836
- You haven't.
- And as soon as Clayton

21:10.903 --> 21:13.739
comes around, all
of a sudden you have an issue.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.407
Ask the girls in the house,
Clayton.

21:15.474 --> 21:17.276
- I--I just need to--

21:17.343 --> 21:18.277
I'm gonna step away
for a second.

21:18.344 --> 21:19.812
- Okay.

21:19.879 --> 21:22.915
[cheers and applause]

21:25.918 --> 21:29.054
- Welcome back to "The
Bachelor: The Women Tell All."

21:29.121 --> 21:30.723
So I'm here with Shanae,

21:30.790 --> 21:32.792
whose issues
with the other women really led

21:32.858 --> 21:36.328
to some of the wildest and
also weirdest confrontations

21:36.395 --> 21:37.997
the show has ever seen.

21:38.063 --> 21:39.431
And I know all
the women have opinions,

21:39.498 --> 21:41.200
and we are gonna get to that,
but I do want to give you

21:41.267 --> 21:44.003
an opportunity to have
the floor here for a moment.

21:44.069 --> 21:45.271
Take me back
to the very beginning.

21:45.337 --> 21:47.473
What made you want to come
on "The Bachelor"

21:47.540 --> 21:49.008
and meet Clayton?

21:49.074 --> 21:52.511
- Well, again, I have
been single for five years,

21:52.578 --> 21:57.216
and, going on the dating apps,
you know, friends of friends

21:57.283 --> 22:00.085
to finally, like, maybe
focusing on myself, right?

22:00.152 --> 22:03.422
So finally having confidence
in myself, loving myself,

22:03.489 --> 22:05.291
I'm like,
let's apply to "The Bachelor."

22:05.357 --> 22:07.426
So I did.
- And this might actually

22:07.493 --> 22:09.995
surprise a lot of viewers,
but things were actually

22:10.062 --> 22:11.864
pretty calm for you
right at the beginning.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.098
- Yeah.
- It wasn't all drama

22:13.165 --> 22:15.367
right away
shot out of a cannon.

22:15.434 --> 22:16.435
How did you feel
things we're going

22:16.502 --> 22:17.703
at the beginning with Clayton?

22:17.770 --> 22:19.738
- At the beginning,
I thought it was great.

22:19.805 --> 22:21.507
You know,
there was no drama yet,

22:21.574 --> 22:25.010
so that was a good thing,
but it just changed

22:25.077 --> 22:27.746
after we all went
into the house day two.

22:27.813 --> 22:30.783
Just 360.
- What happened?

22:30.850 --> 22:33.986
- So Elizabeth--
going back to everything,

22:34.053 --> 22:39.225
so Elizabeth and I were friends
on night one or day one.

22:39.291 --> 22:43.162
Day two, it was night and day
with our "friendship."

22:43.229 --> 22:45.497
And it went downhill
from there.

22:45.564 --> 22:48.567
She was toxic. She ignored me.
She wasn't acknowledging me.

22:48.634 --> 22:51.470
And again, if you want to be
all those things, that is fine,

22:51.537 --> 22:54.440
but don't call me your friend,
don't lie about it.

22:54.506 --> 22:58.177
- I don't know if anyone
is aware of this time frame.

22:58.244 --> 23:00.713
It's literally one day.

23:00.779 --> 23:03.182
And I remember
having one conversation

23:03.249 --> 23:04.450
with you that first night.

23:04.516 --> 23:06.919
And the only thing
I remember you saying

23:06.986 --> 23:08.888
in a group of about six women

23:08.954 --> 23:11.323
was that you hadn't had
a relationship in five years.

23:11.390 --> 23:12.625
I shared with you a story

23:12.691 --> 23:15.394
about my previously
failed engagement.

23:15.461 --> 23:16.695
And then I went
to go get another drink

23:16.762 --> 23:18.530
and had another conversation
with another girl.

23:18.597 --> 23:21.133
So if that is what
you consider intimacy,

23:21.200 --> 23:22.768
I can understand
why you've been so confused

23:22.835 --> 23:24.103
up to this point in your life.

23:24.169 --> 23:25.804
- It wasn't about day two.

23:25.871 --> 23:27.406
It wasn't about day three
or whatever.

23:27.473 --> 23:29.708
It was the whole time
you were in the house,

23:29.775 --> 23:31.410
you were fake to me,
you ignored me,

23:31.477 --> 23:32.678
you didn't acknowledge me.

23:32.745 --> 23:33.879
You're fake.

23:33.946 --> 23:34.980
- But wait, why would you--

23:35.047 --> 23:36.382
why would you care though?

23:36.448 --> 23:37.483
'Cause you came into this like,

23:37.549 --> 23:38.751
"I didn't come here
to make friends."

23:38.817 --> 23:39.785
And that's cool.

23:39.852 --> 23:40.953
Like, nobody's mad at you
for that.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.254
But then, like, don't be like,

23:42.321 --> 23:43.555
"She wasn't my friend."

23:43.622 --> 23:44.757
Like--
- I get that.

23:44.823 --> 23:46.325
- You don't have to be
my friend,

23:46.392 --> 23:48.928
but don't be one way with me
and then the opposite the next.

23:48.994 --> 23:50.162
- She wasn't.
- According to you,

23:50.229 --> 23:51.430
she was ignoring you.

23:51.497 --> 23:52.898
She was ignoring you.
- Did I forget buying you

23:52.965 --> 23:54.500
a best friends necklace?

23:54.566 --> 23:57.269
Like, I don't remember
any type of interaction

23:57.336 --> 23:59.705
with you the first day
that would garner

23:59.772 --> 24:02.875
such really intense obsession,
honestly.

24:02.942 --> 24:03.976
- I'm pretty sure
you're the one that said

24:04.043 --> 24:05.377
that we were
"really good friends."

24:05.444 --> 24:06.679
- Oh, yeah.
I also said I loved you, right?

24:06.745 --> 24:09.181
- You did.
And you forgot about that.

24:09.248 --> 24:11.050
- Okay.
- You apologize to me

24:11.116 --> 24:12.885
over and over, you love me,

24:12.952 --> 24:14.586
if we have a problem,
you'll come to my face,

24:14.653 --> 24:16.055
and you continue to lie.

24:16.121 --> 24:18.290
- Lie about what?
- I can't even riddle off

24:18.357 --> 24:20.359
the amount of lies
that you've told on this TV.

24:20.426 --> 24:22.561
So don't even try to sit here
acting like you're not a liar,

24:22.628 --> 24:24.096
because we all know
that you are.

24:24.163 --> 24:25.497
- You're a hypocrite, Shanae.

24:25.564 --> 24:28.534
And you are a narcissistic,
gaslighting biotch.

24:28.600 --> 24:29.635
That's what you are.

24:29.702 --> 24:31.270
Like, that's what
you've done to all of us.

24:31.337 --> 24:33.272
That's what
you've done to Clayton.

24:33.339 --> 24:34.873
Like, I know it.

24:36.175 --> 24:37.743
- All right, I want
to fast-forward a little bit,

24:37.810 --> 24:40.379
because everything then sort of
escalated into Houston,

24:40.446 --> 24:43.482
where trophies
weren't even safe

24:43.549 --> 24:46.552
at--at that point
after the Bachelor Bowl.

24:46.618 --> 24:49.021
And there was a real
turn of events.

24:49.088 --> 24:52.157
You apologized to the women.

24:52.224 --> 24:54.994
- Fake.
- Why did you do that?

24:55.060 --> 24:56.328
- I did it for Clayton.

24:56.395 --> 24:59.064
I didn't want to apologize.
I was there for Clayton.

24:59.131 --> 25:00.833
I liked Clayton at the time.
[overlapping chatter]

25:00.899 --> 25:02.234
And he asked me to apologize,

25:02.301 --> 25:03.535
and it meant a lot to him,
so I did.

25:03.602 --> 25:05.237
- Is that not fake?
- That sounds pretty fake.

25:05.304 --> 25:06.372
[all yelling]
- So wait, wait, wait, wait--

25:06.438 --> 25:07.706
- I didn't want to,
you're right.

25:07.773 --> 25:09.475
I didn't want to apologize.
- This is the thing,

25:09.541 --> 25:11.777
Clayton said,
"Do you want to apologize?"

25:11.844 --> 25:13.679
And to Clayton's face,
you said yes.

25:13.746 --> 25:15.114
So you lied, there's a lie.
Okay?

25:15.180 --> 25:16.248
- I did it for him.
- Hold up, hold up.

25:16.315 --> 25:18.283
Then you lied,
and then you came out,

25:18.350 --> 25:20.085
and then you apologized.

25:20.152 --> 25:21.553
You lied to us.

25:21.620 --> 25:24.056
And then you went back
to Clayton, okay,

25:24.123 --> 25:25.357
and told him
that you apologized

25:25.424 --> 25:27.292
and you're really happy
that you did,

25:27.359 --> 25:29.628
okay, and that you think
it's all gonna be good now.

25:29.695 --> 25:30.996
So you lied to him again.

25:31.063 --> 25:32.865
- So what about that, Shanae?
- So you're a liar.

25:32.931 --> 25:33.899
- What about that?
- Address that.

25:33.966 --> 25:35.034
- Yeah, explain--
riddle me that.

25:35.100 --> 25:36.568
- I didn't want to apologize.
Period.

25:36.635 --> 25:37.970
- Why'd you lie to Clayton and
tell him that you [bleep] did?

25:38.037 --> 25:39.438
- Why did you lie?
- So you lied to Clayton.

25:39.505 --> 25:41.140
- You lied to his face!
- If lying is such a big thing

25:41.206 --> 25:42.574
to you, then why aren't you
making a big deal about--

25:42.641 --> 25:44.009
why aren't you holding
that same [bleep] for yourself?

25:44.076 --> 25:45.144
- Hold on, why'd you lie?

25:45.210 --> 25:46.812
I want to know
why you lied to Clayton.

25:46.879 --> 25:48.080
- 'Cause I did it for him.

25:48.147 --> 25:49.415
I didn't want to do it
for you guys, period.

25:49.481 --> 25:50.682
- Lying to Clayton for Clayton?
- But you lied!

25:50.749 --> 25:52.651
- Whoops, sorry.
- You can't talk [bleep]

25:52.718 --> 25:55.120
about people lying
when you lie to the man

25:55.187 --> 25:56.422
you're gonna marry!

25:56.488 --> 25:58.857
You lied to his face.
- Manipulation.

25:58.924 --> 26:00.559
- Wow!
- And so did you all.

26:00.626 --> 26:02.394
So did you all.
- Okay, so Shanae,

26:02.461 --> 26:04.596
I do want to fast-forward
again, because listen.

26:04.663 --> 26:06.098
You did have the connection
with Clayton.

26:06.165 --> 26:08.434
He was experiencing
feelings for you.

26:08.500 --> 26:10.436
He liked you.
He gave you a rose in Houston.

26:10.502 --> 26:11.870
You then moved on to Toronto

26:11.937 --> 26:15.808
where you were on a two-on-one
date with Genevieve.

26:15.874 --> 26:17.342
Take me back to that.

26:17.409 --> 26:19.745
- Well, my strategy was to win,

26:19.812 --> 26:21.447
get the rose,
and send Genevieve home.

26:21.513 --> 26:23.415
- 'Cause this is all
a game to you.

26:23.482 --> 26:26.518
- I mean, watching back,
and then watching her say,

26:26.585 --> 26:28.187
"This is Shanae
and this is Meryl Streep,"

26:28.253 --> 26:30.656
like, after she called me
an actress to him.

26:30.722 --> 26:31.857
- And a Chihuahua.
Don't forget that.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.125
- And a Chi--okay, wait, yeah.

26:33.192 --> 26:34.460
I don't even know
where that came from.

26:34.526 --> 26:36.595
- Say you won in the end,
and Clayton watches back

26:36.662 --> 26:38.931
and sees how nasty
of a human being you are...

26:38.997 --> 26:40.933
do you think he would
still want to marry you?

26:40.999 --> 26:43.402
Do you think anybody wants
to watch that and marry you?

26:43.469 --> 26:44.970
- I'm--I think so.
- I don't think so.

26:45.037 --> 26:46.338
- I think so.
- Unless they're trash.

26:46.405 --> 26:48.040
- Shanae, that's why you're
single for five years,

26:48.107 --> 26:49.475
'cause you're delusional.

26:49.541 --> 26:51.176
You called yourself an actor.

26:51.243 --> 26:52.978
You called--
you compared yourself

26:53.045 --> 26:54.446
to Meryl Streep, Shanae.

26:54.513 --> 26:56.014
You compared yourself
to Meryl Streep

26:56.081 --> 26:57.516
after calling me an actress.

26:57.583 --> 26:58.684
- Okay, okay.
Look, look.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.185
I think we got a lot
to cover here.

27:00.252 --> 27:01.186
I'll tell you what.

27:01.253 --> 27:02.654
We got some room
in the hot seat.

27:02.721 --> 27:03.956
Genevieve,
why don't you come on up?

27:04.022 --> 27:05.324
We'll talk this out.
- Oh, no.

27:05.390 --> 27:08.327
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

27:08.393 --> 27:10.496
<i>♪ ♪</i>

27:10.562 --> 27:13.065

for being here.

27:13.132 --> 27:14.500

27:14.566 --> 27:16.702
[loud cheers and applause]

27:16.768 --> 27:19.338
- So we've got Genevieve,
we've got Shanae.

27:19.404 --> 27:20.472
We got a whole lot more

27:20.539 --> 27:22.574
of "The Women Tell All"
when it returns.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.344
Trust me, you're not
gonna want to miss this.

27:25.410 --> 27:28.347
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

27:33.152 --> 27:37.022
[cheers and applause]

27:38.891 --> 27:40.659
- Welcome back
to "The Women Tell All."

27:40.726 --> 27:43.829
It's been an explosive start
to the evening.

27:43.896 --> 27:45.764
And we are just
getting rolling.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.599
I'm joined right now
by Shanae and Genevieve who,

27:47.666 --> 27:50.802
after a tumultuous few weeks,
found themselves

27:50.869 --> 27:53.138
on that two-on-one date
in Niagara Falls.

27:53.205 --> 27:55.007
And Genevieve,
how much were you dreading

27:55.073 --> 27:57.276
going on that date with Shanae?

27:57.342 --> 27:58.443
- Part of me
was a little nervous,

27:58.510 --> 28:00.012
just because a two-on-one
isn't something

28:00.078 --> 28:02.181
that I would want
to normally be on.

28:02.247 --> 28:03.549
I don't think
anyone would want to be.

28:03.615 --> 28:04.983
Especially finding out
you're going on a two-on-one

28:05.050 --> 28:06.485
with someone
who you would never want

28:06.552 --> 28:08.387
to be on a date with.

28:08.453 --> 28:10.789
It's hard.
Shanae and I decided before,

28:10.856 --> 28:12.591
we said we won't talk
about each other.

28:12.658 --> 28:14.059
And honestly, like,

28:14.126 --> 28:16.195
I didn't want to spend my time
talking about Shanae.

28:16.261 --> 28:18.830
And then when he said,
"Genevieve, I have a question,"

28:18.897 --> 28:21.567
I mean, I just--

28:21.633 --> 28:23.702
- And then you come to find out
that he's asking you

28:23.769 --> 28:25.103
if you're--if you're acting.

28:25.170 --> 28:27.940
Shanae, why did you think
she was acting?

28:28.006 --> 28:30.809
- Well, the night before
our two-on-one date, you--

28:30.876 --> 28:32.844
I overheard you saying
that you wanted to leave,

28:32.911 --> 28:34.213
you had your bags packed.

28:34.279 --> 28:36.081
That's like the second
or third time I heard that.

28:36.148 --> 28:38.850
- Yes, I--the first night,
I was crying multiple times.

28:38.917 --> 28:40.719
I wanted to go home.
I was so stressed out.

28:40.786 --> 28:42.354
When I found out
about the two-on-one,

28:42.421 --> 28:43.855
I was sobbing, like, honestly.

28:43.922 --> 28:48.293
I was so anxious and worried
and just, like, stressed out.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.729
And then going there
and hearing that,

28:50.796 --> 28:52.731
like, are you an actress
and are you lying to me,

28:52.798 --> 28:53.932
I knew something was coming.

28:53.999 --> 28:56.301
I had a feeling, because I knew

28:56.368 --> 28:58.804
that Shanae would
pull anything, honestly.

28:58.870 --> 29:02.040
And then watching back,
it's even more shocking,

29:02.107 --> 29:05.544
because I see that Shanae's
here comparing herself

29:05.611 --> 29:07.980
to Meryl Streep and saying,
on the date,

29:08.046 --> 29:10.782
that she's so acting
as she flips her hair.

29:10.849 --> 29:13.952
And she's going to Clayton
telling him I'm an actress,

29:14.019 --> 29:16.455
so, like, it's shocking.

29:16.521 --> 29:18.657
- So honestly,
waking up to the two-on-one,

29:18.724 --> 29:21.927
I was like, I'm going on this
date with Clayton, right?

29:21.994 --> 29:24.930
It didn't happen that way.
I got eliminated.

29:24.997 --> 29:26.965
You know, I--
after I got eliminated,

29:27.032 --> 29:28.834
I went home, I was grieving.

29:28.900 --> 29:30.502
I couldn't sleep,
I couldn't eat.

29:30.569 --> 29:32.471
I've lost weight.

29:32.537 --> 29:34.406
And then
when you get eliminated,

29:34.473 --> 29:36.942
you go home and [bleep] Aaron
from Katie's season.

29:37.009 --> 29:38.443
- Wh--
- Oh!

29:38.510 --> 29:41.413
all: What?

29:41.480 --> 29:42.414
- Oh, my God.

29:42.481 --> 29:43.682
- The fact that you're even--

29:43.749 --> 29:45.884
this is mind-blowing.

29:45.951 --> 29:47.919
- Hold on real quick,
I-wanna

29:47.986 --> 29:49.755
to try to clarify
what you're saying.

29:49.821 --> 29:51.723
So you're talking
about Aaron Clancy...

29:51.790 --> 29:53.025
- Oh, yeah.
- From Katie's season?

29:53.091 --> 29:54.092
- Yeah, because I met him--yep.

29:54.159 --> 29:55.227
I met him at a bar.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.129
I--I didn't even kiss him.
- No.

29:57.195 --> 29:58.830
- Genevieve, you don't need
to defend yourself.

29:58.897 --> 30:00.299
- Yeah, without any evidence
on that, that's a pretty--

30:00.365 --> 30:01.667
- Without any evidence, that
was absolutely uncalled for.

30:01.733 --> 30:03.268
- Why would you just
make that up?

30:03.335 --> 30:04.603
- Okay, but so after
you get eliminated,

30:04.670 --> 30:06.405
you're not grieving,
you're not sad.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.307
You go hang out
with Bachelor Nation.

30:08.373 --> 30:09.741
- Oh, you know what?
You know what's funny?

in his DMs, honey.

30:15.080 --> 30:16.481

honey.

30:16.548 --> 30:18.917

30:19.017 --> 30:20.752

30:23.188 --> 30:24.323

Let me see it.

30:24.389 --> 30:25.957

"Is she really this bad?"

30:26.024 --> 30:28.260

of all your hearts

30:28.327 --> 30:29.628
replying to his messages
and all--

30:29.695 --> 30:32.531

That's not sliding in his DMs.

30:32.597 --> 30:34.232

30:39.237 --> 30:41.173

Bachelor Nation might

30:41.239 --> 30:42.441
be sliding in her DMs,

30:42.507 --> 30:44.109

why they're not for you.

30:44.176 --> 30:46.578

Like you know, Hunter.

30:46.645 --> 30:48.447

30:57.556 --> 30:58.890
One thing I do want to clarify,

30:58.957 --> 31:00.959
so are you essentially saying
that she wasn't there

31:01.026 --> 31:02.928
for Clayton in the first place,
and the fact that she was

31:02.994 --> 31:04.596
hanging out with people
from Bachelor Nation...

31:04.663 --> 31:05.831
- Yeah, exactly.
- After she got sent home

31:05.897 --> 31:06.865
proves that?

31:06.932 --> 31:09.201
- Why--if you are
so into someone,

31:09.267 --> 31:10.569
you're not going home

31:10.635 --> 31:12.771
to maybe focus on yourself,
doing your own thing.

31:12.838 --> 31:14.306
You're hanging out
with Bachelor Nation.

31:14.373 --> 31:16.141
That is a red flag to me.
Why would you do that?

31:16.208 --> 31:17.676
- Everything's a red flag
to you.

31:17.743 --> 31:18.877

- You're a walking red flag.

31:18.944 --> 31:19.878

31:19.945 --> 31:21.580

31:21.646 --> 31:22.848

31:22.914 --> 31:24.750

on Clayton's season?

31:24.816 --> 31:25.851

- Why?

31:25.917 --> 31:27.486
- I saw him at a bar.
- You did. Okay.

31:27.552 --> 31:28.687
- Nothing happened.

31:28.754 --> 31:30.522
The fact that you went
to "I [bleep] him"

31:30.589 --> 31:32.090
is crazy in your head.
- You never [bleep] him?

31:32.157 --> 31:33.125
- Never.
- Okay.

31:33.191 --> 31:34.326

31:40.999 --> 31:43.034

everyone's experience.

just own up

31:44.503 --> 31:45.904

that you said?

31:45.971 --> 31:47.105

- No.

31:47.172 --> 31:48.473
- That's the thing. Never.

31:48.540 --> 31:49.941

31:52.511 --> 31:54.513

32:30.415 --> 32:32.617
- No.
There's--no. Nothing.

he would watch it back and just
have been so disappointed.

33:03.448 --> 33:04.783

38:25.837 --> 38:27.972
- Um, I think more
than anything, it's just, like,

38:28.039 --> 38:31.810
sad to see a beginning
with so much potential

38:31.876 --> 38:33.411
end the way that it did.

38:33.478 --> 38:36.080
Um, you know, regardless
of what happened in between,

38:36.147 --> 38:37.282
it's just sad.

38:37.348 --> 38:39.784
- So where did it all go wrong?

38:39.851 --> 38:41.920
- I think the week
that I received

38:41.986 --> 38:43.655
that second one-on-one,
the week in Croatia,

38:43.721 --> 38:47.592
that for everyone
was a turning point.

38:47.659 --> 38:51.763
And then seeing,
you know, myself receive

38:51.830 --> 38:54.766
a second one-on-one
when there were amazing women

38:54.833 --> 38:56.835
not even getting their first,

38:56.901 --> 39:00.471
that just inevitably changed
the chemistry within the house

39:00.538 --> 39:02.207
and our relationships
with each other.

39:02.273 --> 39:07.178
It was never, ever my intention
to make anyone feel insecure.

39:07.245 --> 39:08.813
- Okay.
I want to open it up to Mara,

39:08.880 --> 39:10.782
because, Mara, you were really
outspoken with respect

39:10.849 --> 39:14.085
to your belief that Sarah was
not ready for an engagement.

39:14.152 --> 39:16.221
Why?
- I saw things from her

39:16.287 --> 39:19.958
that I didn't find to be
coinciding with wife material.

39:20.024 --> 39:22.827
- I think Mara honestly
fell on the sword

39:22.894 --> 39:25.330
for a lot of people
who were feeling the same way.

39:25.396 --> 39:28.166
It just sounded like the well
was being poisoned.

39:28.233 --> 39:30.134
Like, their connections
weren't measuring up,

39:30.201 --> 39:32.704
when in reality,
we don't really know

39:32.770 --> 39:36.107
if the information that was
being received was accurate.

39:36.174 --> 39:38.176
- Sarah,
after the first one-on-one,

39:38.243 --> 39:40.378
she said
"I was the rock for him,"

39:40.445 --> 39:42.413
and you guys cried together,

39:42.480 --> 39:46.084
and it was kind of like,
okay, you're it.

39:46.150 --> 39:48.319
Like, he said, like--
- And I understand--

39:48.386 --> 39:49.787
I completely understand that

39:49.854 --> 39:51.456
that's maybe
how it made you feel.

39:51.522 --> 39:52.657
If I had've known that,

39:52.724 --> 39:54.092
I would have cleared
that up immediately.

39:54.158 --> 39:55.727
- No, regardless of how
you made me feel,

39:55.793 --> 39:57.929
like, if you didn't--
if Clayton wasn't crying--

39:57.996 --> 40:00.298
like, he seemed to say,
like, "I wasn't crying."

40:00.365 --> 40:02.500
So I'm just wondering
why I heard that, like,

40:02.567 --> 40:05.470
he was crying to you when he
says he wasn't crying at all.

40:05.536 --> 40:09.207
- I can ensure you my intention
was never to hurt anyone.

40:09.274 --> 40:12.076
It was to--genuinely just
to share, just to connect,

40:12.143 --> 40:13.945
just to freaking survive.

40:14.012 --> 40:18.182
- It seems you were
using it as a weapon

40:18.249 --> 40:21.119
against the other women
to make them feel intimidated

40:21.185 --> 40:22.287
and not so secure.

40:22.353 --> 40:24.622
- Absolutely not.
And if you know me,

40:24.689 --> 40:26.891
you know my intent would never,

40:26.958 --> 40:30.194
ever be
to purposely hurt anyone

40:30.261 --> 40:34.132
or to purposely
make anyone feel insecure.

40:34.198 --> 40:35.900
- I don't know if maybe
it's just your perception

40:35.967 --> 40:38.670
is different
than what was actually reality.

40:38.736 --> 40:40.571
I don't know
what your intentions were.

40:40.638 --> 40:43.675
Um, I think
where things get confusing

40:43.741 --> 40:45.944
is you haven't really
touched on the things

40:46.010 --> 40:49.180
that you were telling us
versus actually reality.

40:49.247 --> 40:52.116
You did say that Clayton cried.
That wasn't true.

40:52.183 --> 40:55.086
I would just love, and I think
we could all move on from it,

40:55.153 --> 40:56.821
if you would just
at least admit

40:56.888 --> 40:58.323
that you were
saying these things,

40:58.389 --> 41:00.058
because I think, like,
where it really hurt me

41:00.124 --> 41:02.360
and where it really hurt Rachel
is we were your friends,

41:02.427 --> 41:06.264
and you are calling us liars,
and, like, I would never lie.

41:06.331 --> 41:07.498
- I think what I know is that

41:07.565 --> 41:09.200
there were multiple other
people in the room--

41:09.267 --> 41:10.935
and Sarah, like,
I had a conversation

41:11.002 --> 41:12.837
where I was willing
to listen to you,

41:12.904 --> 41:16.908
but when six or however many
other women at this point

41:16.975 --> 41:19.344
saying Sarah
is saying these things,

41:19.410 --> 41:20.979
Sarah's giving these details.

41:21.045 --> 41:23.081
Okay, is Clayton lying?
Or are the women lying?

41:23.147 --> 41:25.350
or are there details that are,
like--

41:25.416 --> 41:28.019
because there--
it's just not making sense.

41:28.086 --> 41:30.555
- Did you cry with Clayton?
Did he--did he cry?

41:30.621 --> 41:32.724
- Yes, I did, very much.

41:32.790 --> 41:34.058
- Like, did he cry though?

41:34.125 --> 41:36.694
- But did Clayton cry?
- Did Clayton cry?

41:36.761 --> 41:39.330
- I really don't want
to speak for Clayton.

41:39.397 --> 41:41.299
Yes, there were instances
where he did get

41:41.366 --> 41:42.800
upset on our one-on-one.

41:42.867 --> 41:44.469
- Did you see tears?

41:44.535 --> 41:46.004
- I mean, yes.

41:46.070 --> 41:47.205
- Yeah? Okay.
- Correct.

41:47.271 --> 41:48.439
- Okay.
- All right, so we'll hear

41:48.506 --> 41:49.807
Clayton say that he didn't.
- Yes, we--

41:49.874 --> 41:51.242
- Let's have them both--
- Yeah. We should ask Clayton.

41:51.309 --> 41:52.343
- We got to talk
to Clayton about that.

41:52.410 --> 41:53.344
- All right, well, listen.
- 100%.

41:53.411 --> 41:54.512
- It was--it was a very,

41:54.579 --> 41:55.646
very emotional ride.

41:55.713 --> 41:56.781
There was a lot of ups

47:43.427 --> 47:45.763
- You had said
that you feel worthy of love,

47:45.830 --> 47:47.064
but you always end up...

47:47.131 --> 47:48.132
- Yeah.
- Falling short.

47:48.199 --> 47:50.034
- Yeah.
- How come?

47:50.101 --> 47:51.836
- You know,
like I told Clayton early on,

47:51.902 --> 47:56.240
I do take a while to trust men.

47:56.307 --> 47:59.910
And that just, like,
comes from my childhood and,

47:59.977 --> 48:02.480
you know, I come from,
like, a very loving family.

48:02.546 --> 48:05.583
I'm very blessed.
My parents love me so much.

48:05.649 --> 48:07.385
But I think
when you're a kid

48:07.451 --> 48:09.954
coming from parents
that separate a lot--

48:10.020 --> 48:13.257
my dad was not around a lot.

48:13.324 --> 48:15.292
And again,
that was just because

48:15.359 --> 48:17.128
they were having problems,
but as a kid,

48:17.194 --> 48:18.662
I think you take on
a lot of that

48:18.729 --> 48:20.264
and feel like it's your fault.

48:20.331 --> 48:23.367
Um, so I always tried
to be perfect.

48:23.434 --> 48:25.302
I always got straight As.

48:25.369 --> 48:27.371
I always played the sports
that I knew,

48:27.438 --> 48:28.873
you know, he was interested in.

48:28.939 --> 48:31.842
And, um--

48:31.909 --> 48:33.744
sorry.

48:33.811 --> 48:35.179
- You got it, girl.

48:35.246 --> 48:39.250
- Um, yeah,
I think I did those things

48:39.316 --> 48:41.819
'cause I thought that would
make me worthy of love.

48:41.886 --> 48:44.755
And again, like,
my parents love me so much,

48:44.822 --> 48:46.957
but I think, like, as a child,

48:47.024 --> 48:48.325
like,
I just took on so much of that

48:48.392 --> 48:50.961
and feeling like I wasn't
worthy of the--of that love.

48:51.028 --> 48:53.364
And then that just started
coming into relationships

48:53.431 --> 48:57.134
where I would date guys
that it was very toxic.

48:59.103 --> 49:02.573
And I never fully felt
like I was enough with them.

49:02.640 --> 49:06.310
And yeah, I think this was
just, like, another scenario

49:06.377 --> 49:11.449
where I was in an environment
where I was kind of having to

49:11.515 --> 49:13.584
gain this guy's affection
and gain his love

49:13.651 --> 49:17.087
by doing things
to try to earn his attention.

49:17.154 --> 49:19.690
So then to, like,
come up short again,

49:19.757 --> 49:22.693
yeah, I think it was hard,
and yeah,

49:22.760 --> 49:25.329
it was just hard to watch.
[small laugh]

49:25.396 --> 49:27.765
- You said that you were
craving safety and trust.

49:27.832 --> 49:29.700
- Mm-hmm.

49:29.767 --> 49:31.435
- Did you see Clayton
as being a person

49:31.502 --> 49:34.605
that could provide
that for you?

49:34.672 --> 49:36.340
- At the time,
I thought that he could be.

49:36.407 --> 49:38.776
And I-I thought that I was
gonna be in the Fantasy Suites,

49:38.843 --> 49:40.478
and it was something
that I was thinking about

49:40.544 --> 49:44.582
of is he going to be my first?

49:44.648 --> 49:47.284
I think society
puts a lot of pressure on women

49:47.351 --> 49:50.287
that it changes who they are
if they lose their virginity,

49:50.354 --> 49:52.590
and I just kind of wanted
to make it known that, like,

49:52.656 --> 49:54.124
I don't feel that way.

49:54.191 --> 49:56.694
I think it's okay if someone
wants to wait until marriage.

49:56.760 --> 49:57.995
I think it's okay if someone

49:58.062 --> 49:59.497
wants to have sex
every weekend.

49:59.563 --> 50:01.131
Like, I think--
I think it just should be...

50:01.198 --> 50:02.833
- Whoo!
- A personal decision.

50:02.900 --> 50:05.669
[applause]

50:05.736 --> 50:07.104
- I want to go back
to the first night.

50:07.171 --> 50:08.639
I think
the First Impression Rose,

50:08.706 --> 50:10.574
in a lot of ways, is a gift.

50:10.641 --> 50:11.942
- Mm-hmm.

50:12.009 --> 50:13.944
- I think sometimes though
it can also be a curse.

50:14.011 --> 50:15.779
- Yeah, totally.
- Did you feel that?

50:15.846 --> 50:17.248
Did you feel the pressure?

50:17.314 --> 50:19.350
- Um, yeah, I did.

50:19.416 --> 50:22.152
It was, like,
so amazing that day to get it,

50:22.219 --> 50:24.088
and then, like, immediately
go into that group date

50:24.154 --> 50:26.857
where it was clear that he was
going to be open to everyone,

50:26.924 --> 50:28.692
which is what
you're supposed to do.

50:28.759 --> 50:31.996
I think just starting
on such a high,

50:32.062 --> 50:35.366
it did make my low feel
even lower in that moment.

50:35.432 --> 50:37.301
- We didn't see
a ton of emotion

50:37.368 --> 50:38.636

- He mentioned how
you're very fearless in life,

57:21.805 --> 57:26.643
but with Clayton, you showed
a fearlessness in love.

57:26.710 --> 57:28.812
- I was uncomfortable
pushing myself, like,

57:28.879 --> 57:31.315
the whole time,
but also it felt right.

57:31.381 --> 57:33.817
And it's like, okay, it's time
to break down these walls.

57:33.884 --> 57:38.889
And I--I really felt like
Clayton was the right person

57:38.956 --> 57:40.390
to do that with.

57:40.457 --> 57:41.391
- It's one thing to tell him
that you were

57:41.458 --> 57:43.026
falling in love with him,

57:43.093 --> 57:45.295
but then what'd it feel like
to finally tell him

57:45.362 --> 57:47.097
you were in love with him?

57:47.164 --> 57:53.403
- For me, I wanted to feel
like if I was feeling it,

57:53.470 --> 57:57.641
like, I--I didn't want
to filter myself or,

57:57.708 --> 57:59.576
you know,
hush any of that down.

57:59.643 --> 58:01.511
I wanted him to know
where I was coming from

58:01.578 --> 58:03.180
and know where I was at
with him.

58:03.246 --> 58:04.748
- Where are you at right now?

58:04.815 --> 58:07.317
- I'm really excited
for the future and,

58:07.384 --> 58:09.953
like, hopeful that
that person is still out there.

58:10.020 --> 58:11.288
I know they're still out there.

58:11.355 --> 58:12.656
- They are.
- And it's just a matter

58:12.723 --> 58:15.525
of timing and a matter
of meeting him, so...

58:15.592 --> 58:17.027
- Serene, thank you so much
for being here.

58:17.094 --> 58:18.595
We certainly wish you the very,
very best.

58:18.662 --> 58:20.097
Let's hear it for Serene,
everyone.

58:20.163 --> 58:22.265
[cheers and applause]

58:22.332 --> 58:23.667
All right.
Coming up next,

58:23.734 --> 58:27.237
Clayton's finally here
to face all of his exes.

58:27.304 --> 58:29.139
That's not gonna
be uncomfortable.

58:29.206 --> 58:31.641
And that's coming up when
"The Women Tell All" returns.

That's right,

What's up, brother?
Good to see you, man.

59:21.558 --> 59:23.693
You been good?
- Good to see you, man.

59:25.729 --> 59:27.764
- Oh, it's so good to see you.

59:27.831 --> 59:29.533

I can't believe we're here.

59:30.967 --> 59:31.935
Thanks for being here.
Listen,

59:32.002 --> 59:33.236
I've sat in that seat before,

59:33.303 --> 59:34.671
and it--it gets pretty hot.

59:34.738 --> 59:36.440
- Nerves are racing
at an all-time high right now.

59:36.506 --> 59:37.674
- Yeah, we're gonna get
through it together.

59:37.741 --> 59:38.909
Don't worry about it.
- Yeah. Well, thank you.

59:38.975 --> 59:40.444
I'm glad that I got you
on my side,

59:40.510 --> 59:42.345
but it's great to see you all.

59:42.412 --> 59:44.347
You guys all look great.

59:44.414 --> 59:45.382
Guess we'll get into it.
- Yeah.

59:45.449 --> 59:46.550
First time
in a while that you've--

59:46.616 --> 59:48.685
you've sat here in front
of all the ladies.

59:48.752 --> 59:50.720
How does it feel?

59:50.787 --> 59:52.856
- I don't know if it's cliché,
but it just--

59:52.923 --> 59:55.492
it feels--it felt like a dream.

59:55.559 --> 59:57.861
I think going out
of the experience

59:57.928 --> 1:00:00.363
and going back to my life,
per se,

1:00:00.430 --> 1:00:02.732
I started to have all these
rush of emotions come back.

1:00:02.799 --> 1:00:04.968
And then watching it back,
and now we're here.

1:00:05.035 --> 1:00:06.670
It's like, we lived it,
we watched it,

1:00:06.736 --> 1:00:09.573
and now we're back to
experiencing it again together.

1:00:09.639 --> 1:00:14.578
- What was the hardest part to
you about being the Bachelor?

1:00:14.644 --> 1:00:16.613
- It's--
now that I see it played back,

1:00:16.680 --> 1:00:19.382
the hardest part--the hardest
part's been watching it.

1:00:19.449 --> 1:00:21.017
It's one thing to go through it

1:00:21.084 --> 1:00:23.253
and feel that you did your--
you gave it your best.

1:00:23.320 --> 1:00:26.156
It's another thing to go back
and analyze it all and realize

1:00:26.223 --> 1:00:29.826
that I was far from perfect
and I made a lot of mistakes.

1:00:29.893 --> 1:00:31.328
- Okay, so what do you regret?

1:00:31.394 --> 1:00:33.730
- I wish I would have
done things differently.

1:00:33.797 --> 1:00:35.398
But as far as
it comes to regret,

1:00:35.465 --> 1:00:37.067
I did everything
in those moments

1:00:37.134 --> 1:00:39.102
that I thought was best.

1:00:39.169 --> 1:00:40.470
And then--and then ultimately,

1:00:40.537 --> 1:00:43.039
they weren't maybe
the right decisions to make.

1:00:43.106 --> 1:00:45.475
But I can't really say
I regret anything,

1:00:45.542 --> 1:00:48.278
because I had
all the best intentions

1:00:48.345 --> 1:00:49.913
with all of my actions
that I took.

1:00:49.980 --> 1:00:51.548
- Yeah.
- Unfortunately,

1:00:51.615 --> 1:00:54.251
there were repercussions
for those actions.

1:00:54.317 --> 1:00:56.052
- I don't know.
Like, Clayton, like--

1:00:56.119 --> 1:01:01.224
I'm not coming at you
or anything, you know me.

1:01:01.291 --> 1:01:03.460
Just--just a true question.

1:01:03.527 --> 1:01:06.530
Why neglect all of the words
that you're hearing

1:01:06.596 --> 1:01:07.964
from all of these
wonderful women?

1:01:08.031 --> 1:01:10.300
I mean,
Sarah, Susie, me, Teddi,

1:01:10.367 --> 1:01:12.969
like, we're all telling you
that Shanae is toxic

1:01:13.036 --> 1:01:14.471
and she is hurting
the entire house,

1:01:14.538 --> 1:01:18.041
and then she does
this one fake apology,

1:01:18.108 --> 1:01:19.576
lies to your face constantly,

1:01:19.643 --> 1:01:22.679
and you choose to believe her
over all of us.

1:01:22.746 --> 1:01:24.814
Like, why?
That doesn't make sense.

1:01:24.881 --> 1:01:26.750
[laughter]

1:01:26.816 --> 1:01:28.718
- I mean, it's a fair question,

1:01:28.785 --> 1:01:32.422
and as I started having
people come and tell me things,

1:01:32.489 --> 1:01:34.824
I mean, this was early on
and we hadn't built trust yet,

1:01:34.891 --> 1:01:37.294
and I was looking
to build that,

1:01:37.360 --> 1:01:38.962
but I knew that came with time.

1:01:39.029 --> 1:01:42.399
And so I was wanting
tangible evidence,

1:01:42.465 --> 1:01:44.434
something that I could say,
this--

1:01:44.501 --> 1:01:45.936
- But what's more tangible
than the entire house?

1:01:46.002 --> 1:01:47.771
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna stop you

1:01:47.837 --> 1:01:49.139
right there.
- Six women.

1:01:49.206 --> 1:01:51.241
- 'Cause I--
I told you about Shanae.

1:01:51.308 --> 1:01:53.410
I know Sierra did.
I know Mara did.

1:01:53.476 --> 1:01:55.812
Like, numerous of us said it,
and it's like,

1:01:55.879 --> 1:01:57.881
I don't know, it's just,
like, frustrating for me

1:01:57.948 --> 1:01:59.816
to see you, like,
sit here and say that.

1:01:59.883 --> 1:02:01.218
It's like,
I wish you would have--

1:02:01.284 --> 1:02:02.986
you would sit there
and own the fact

1:02:03.053 --> 1:02:05.088
that you had a better
connection with Shanae

1:02:05.155 --> 1:02:06.356
than all of us.

1:02:06.423 --> 1:02:08.425
And it's like, sit there
and own it like a man.

1:02:08.491 --> 1:02:11.161
'Cause nobody forced you to,
like, force her on a table...

1:02:11.228 --> 1:02:13.063
- Yeah.
- And make out with her.

1:02:13.129 --> 1:02:15.398
- No, I--
I don't want to dodge it.

1:02:15.465 --> 1:02:17.033
And no, I had--
we had a connection.

1:02:17.100 --> 1:02:20.904
And I was basing
my decisions off of--

1:02:20.971 --> 1:02:23.273
yeah, off of the connection
that I felt.

1:02:23.340 --> 1:02:25.275
And Shanae,
I thought it was real,

1:02:25.342 --> 1:02:26.543
and it seemed genuine,

1:02:26.610 --> 1:02:31.715
but when you threw the trophy
in the pond, it--

1:02:31.781 --> 1:02:34.050
to me, that was something
that was indefensible.

1:02:34.117 --> 1:02:35.252
At that point, I'm like--

1:02:35.318 --> 1:02:37.654
- But you kept her.
- That was indefensible.

1:02:37.721 --> 1:02:39.189
- But you kept her.
- You sent us home.

1:02:39.256 --> 1:02:41.324
That was a slap in the face.

1:02:41.391 --> 1:02:43.793
- That's disrespectful,
'cause I had your back.

1:02:43.860 --> 1:02:46.062
I was looking out for you.
And I was like,

1:02:46.129 --> 1:02:48.231
I don't want him to make a
stupid-ass decision, you know?

1:02:48.298 --> 1:02:50.667
You did that on your own.
I'd--I'd tried to help you.

1:02:50.734 --> 1:02:53.336
I tried to help you, and I'm
not even trying to diss you.

1:02:53.403 --> 1:02:55.805
I tried to help you.
I literally tried to.

1:02:55.872 --> 1:02:57.073
- We all did.
- And it's like,

1:02:57.140 --> 1:02:59.009
I think you're confusing love
and lust.

1:02:59.075 --> 1:03:00.910
I think that you need to
figure those two out

1:03:00.977 --> 1:03:03.880
and really realize, like, what
it takes to be a married man,

1:03:03.947 --> 1:03:05.448
and I don't think
you're there yet.

1:03:05.515 --> 1:03:07.317
And I think that eventually
you will get there,

1:03:07.384 --> 1:03:09.686
but I do not think right now
or during this journey

1:03:09.753 --> 1:03:11.154
that you were there yet.

1:03:11.221 --> 1:03:12.689
- Okay.

1:03:12.756 --> 1:03:14.758
So--so Clayton,

1:03:14.824 --> 1:03:16.993
after hearing all that
from all the women

1:03:17.060 --> 1:03:18.995
and obviously having
watched this back,

1:03:19.062 --> 1:03:21.431
what do you have to say
to Shanae now?

1:03:21.498 --> 1:03:26.469
- Shanae, I--the big thing that
I was frustrated at is, again,

1:03:26.536 --> 1:03:27.704
I believed you, I did.

1:03:27.771 --> 1:03:30.273
And I thought we had
a genuine connection.

1:03:30.340 --> 1:03:34.044
But as I watched it back
and to see you fake tears,

1:03:34.110 --> 1:03:36.546
to see you be
playing this game,

1:03:36.613 --> 1:03:39.516
you did, you manipulated
the women, you manipulated me.

1:03:39.582 --> 1:03:40.817
- Again, there was a lot

1:03:40.884 --> 1:03:42.986
of other things
that you didn't see.

1:03:43.053 --> 1:03:46.656
You asked for openness,
vulnerability, honesty.

1:03:46.723 --> 1:03:48.358
I gave you all of that,
Clayton.

1:03:48.425 --> 1:03:49.526
- It was fake, Shanae.
- Girl, it was a lie.

1:03:49.592 --> 1:03:50.593
- It wasn't.
- It was a lie.

1:03:50.660 --> 1:03:51.795
- It wasn't.
- It was all a fake.

1:03:51.861 --> 1:03:53.930
- Oh, Shanae!
- You said it--

1:03:53.997 --> 1:03:55.532
[all yelling]
- I gave you all of that,

1:03:55.598 --> 1:03:56.833
and it was true.

1:03:56.900 --> 1:03:58.735
When I opened up to you,
those were real.

1:03:58.802 --> 1:03:59.969
- I'm confused.
- What?

1:04:00.036 --> 1:04:01.504
- No.
- It's just frustrating,

1:04:01.571 --> 1:04:04.507
because I trusted you,
I believed you.

1:04:04.574 --> 1:04:06.810
And it was the worst thing
that I could have done.

1:04:06.876 --> 1:04:08.411
crowd: Oh!
- Period.

1:04:08.478 --> 1:04:09.913
- Period.

1:04:09.979 --> 1:04:12.015
- Yeah, don't even listen
to her, Clayton.

1:04:12.082 --> 1:04:14.451
You've done wasted
enough time on her.

1:04:14.517 --> 1:04:16.553
- Is there an eject button
over there?

1:04:16.619 --> 1:04:18.121
- All right, all right.
I want to--

1:04:18.188 --> 1:04:20.523
I want to calm it down
for a second.

1:04:21.891 --> 1:04:24.461
I want to ask you
about your time with Sarah.

1:04:24.527 --> 1:04:26.963
That was a relationship
that I know there were

1:04:27.030 --> 1:04:29.099
a lot of concerns that were
brought to your attention

1:04:29.165 --> 1:04:30.266
from a lot of different women.

1:04:30.333 --> 1:04:32.235
Why did you choose
to listen to those,

1:04:32.302 --> 1:04:35.271
and how did it affect
your decision?

1:04:35.338 --> 1:04:37.607
- Yeah, you know,
at that point,

1:04:37.674 --> 1:04:39.743
the women that came to me,
I had

1:04:39.809 --> 1:04:42.045
a fair amount of trust in them.

1:04:42.112 --> 1:04:46.449
And for them all to be together
in that moment

1:04:46.516 --> 1:04:48.651
and telling me this same story,

1:04:48.718 --> 1:04:51.755
it became a big red flag.

1:04:51.821 --> 1:04:54.457
Your actions had women

1:04:54.524 --> 1:04:56.259
questioning
if they should stay.

1:04:56.326 --> 1:04:58.862
And almost all of them
told me they were gonna leave

1:04:58.928 --> 1:05:01.564
because of what
you were telling them.

1:05:01.631 --> 1:05:04.000
And what it came across,
just to me,

1:05:04.067 --> 1:05:07.637
was that you were playing
this game for your benefit

1:05:07.704 --> 1:05:10.740
to get them to all leave
to eliminate the competition.

1:05:10.807 --> 1:05:12.609
And as I went forward,
I started to wonder

1:05:12.675 --> 1:05:15.111
if anybody else was playing
that game as well and was--

1:05:15.178 --> 1:05:17.046
'cause I didn't see that
with you.

1:05:17.113 --> 1:05:18.615
And I didn't even know
if I believed it at times,

1:05:18.681 --> 1:05:21.451
but I went forward realizing,
well, if she was so good

1:05:21.518 --> 1:05:23.620
at covering this up,
could some of these women

1:05:23.686 --> 1:05:26.322
that are still here be
playing this game as well?

1:05:26.389 --> 1:05:28.758
And it just put me
in a really bad spot mentally

1:05:28.825 --> 1:05:31.294
where I started
to question everything.

1:05:31.361 --> 1:05:33.863
And I just want you
to know that, yeah,

1:05:33.930 --> 1:05:35.532
your actions had ramifications.

1:05:35.598 --> 1:05:38.134
I'm not saying that that's
what you were trying to do.

1:05:38.201 --> 1:05:41.271
I truthfully, as I watch
it back, I don't really know.

1:05:41.337 --> 1:05:46.376
- It's difficult,
because it feels like...

1:05:46.443 --> 1:05:49.078
I was under the impression and
I would like to still choose

1:05:49.145 --> 1:05:50.914
to believe that we did have
an amazing relationship

1:05:50.980 --> 1:05:54.184
and we had great trust
that was built.

1:05:54.250 --> 1:05:56.586
But watching it back
and seeing some of the things

1:05:56.653 --> 1:06:00.590
that I didn't before,
I can't help but feel as if--

1:06:00.657 --> 1:06:03.493
it's ironic that you are
questioning if I'm disingenuous

1:06:03.560 --> 1:06:06.396
because it feels like that's
what you were doing to me.

1:06:06.463 --> 1:06:10.266
I was already doing my best
to navigate the drama,

1:06:10.333 --> 1:06:13.169
and every time I felt
like I tried to address Mara

1:06:13.236 --> 1:06:15.872
or address the women
and fix it to move forward

1:06:15.939 --> 1:06:17.774
because I cared about you
and our relationship,

1:06:17.841 --> 1:06:19.042
it feels like the person

1:06:19.108 --> 1:06:21.077
constantly putting me
back into it

1:06:21.144 --> 1:06:23.012
and constantly
stirring the pot was you.

1:06:23.079 --> 1:06:25.248
And I wish that you would
have respected me enough

1:06:25.315 --> 1:06:28.551
in our goodbye
to have ended our relationship,

1:06:28.618 --> 1:06:30.186
regardless
of what had happened,

1:06:30.253 --> 1:06:32.589
based on you and I
and our relationship,

1:06:32.655 --> 1:06:37.927
not based on external things
and hearsay, she say, whatever.

1:06:37.994 --> 1:06:40.830
- When those accusations
were brought to me,

1:06:40.897 --> 1:06:43.099
they were from women
that I really trusted.

1:06:43.166 --> 1:06:45.535
And, again,
with them all being in unison,

1:06:45.602 --> 1:06:47.570
I felt that I had
to bring it up to you.

1:06:47.637 --> 1:06:51.474
And I don't understand
why you said

1:06:51.541 --> 1:06:53.510
the things you were saying,
such as,

1:06:53.576 --> 1:06:55.545
you know, "He cried with me."

1:06:55.612 --> 1:06:58.147
And listen, here's the thing.
Real men cry. I cry.

1:06:58.214 --> 1:06:59.682
I mean, you guys have seen it.

1:06:59.749 --> 1:07:02.185
In the previews,
I cried plenty of times.

1:07:02.252 --> 1:07:05.622
Like, I'm not upset that you
said that because it's like,

1:07:05.688 --> 1:07:07.390
oh, you know, oh, she's
calling me out for crying.

1:07:07.457 --> 1:07:08.791
No, I cried plenty.

1:07:08.858 --> 1:07:11.794
But like, what it was
was I was questioning

1:07:11.861 --> 1:07:14.464
why would you tell the other
women I did that when I didn't?

1:07:14.531 --> 1:07:16.633
And that was where--
- And that's the tea, sis.

1:07:16.699 --> 1:07:18.301
- There it is.
- And that's the tea, sis.

1:07:18.368 --> 1:07:22.272
- Because we did have this as a
topic of conversation earlier.

1:07:22.338 --> 1:07:23.806
- Yeah.
- Sarah did

1:07:23.873 --> 1:07:25.375
say that you did cry.

1:07:25.441 --> 1:07:27.744
It was a little bit
of a wishy-washy response.

1:07:27.810 --> 1:07:30.046
So you're saying
that you did not cry

1:07:30.113 --> 1:07:31.781
on your first one-on-one
with Sarah?

1:07:31.848 --> 1:07:33.416
- No, I did not.

1:07:33.483 --> 1:07:35.818
- I did not say
you cried to me.

1:07:35.885 --> 1:07:38.454
I did not say that.
I also--when I was--

1:07:38.521 --> 1:07:41.157
when I was clarifying--
when I was saying the thing

1:07:41.224 --> 1:07:44.360
about not accepting the rose,
I was--

1:07:44.427 --> 1:07:45.695
they were asking about
the date, and I was saying

1:07:45.762 --> 1:07:47.931
how it was hard
and uncomfortable and whatever.

1:07:47.997 --> 1:07:51.167
Sorry if I, like, overshared
that and it was uncomfortable,

1:07:51.234 --> 1:07:52.802
but this feels ridiculous,
again,

1:07:52.869 --> 1:07:54.137
to talk about crying or not.

1:07:54.203 --> 1:07:56.139
I think we both have shed
enough tears on camera...

1:07:56.205 --> 1:07:57.840
- You lie!
- To not have to

1:07:57.907 --> 1:07:59.208
discuss this any further.

1:07:59.275 --> 1:08:01.611
And I don't understand
how it's applicable anymore.

1:08:01.678 --> 1:08:03.413
But that's what I said.

1:08:03.479 --> 1:08:06.716
- Just to be clear, just to be
clear, I do want to say this.

1:08:06.783 --> 1:08:08.484
You did not cry with Sarah?

1:08:08.551 --> 1:08:11.254
- I did not cry on the first--
any of our dates.

1:08:11.321 --> 1:08:12.622
- All right, Sarah.
I mean,

1:08:12.689 --> 1:08:14.057
that's from the horse's mouth.

1:08:14.123 --> 1:08:16.893
[laughter, scattered applause]

1:08:17.860 --> 1:08:19.562
All right, listen. We do have
to take a short break.

1:08:19.629 --> 1:08:21.764
Clayton, sit tight. We're
not quite done with you yet.

1:08:21.831 --> 1:08:25.068
We got so much more
with Clayton and the women

1:08:25.134 --> 1:08:26.402
when we come right back.

1:08:26.469 --> 1:08:28.004
Stick around.

1:08:32.375 --> 1:08:35.311

1:08:35.378 --> 1:08:40.216
<i>♪ ♪</i>

1:08:40.283 --> 1:08:42.685
- Welcome back to "The
Bachelor: The Women Tell All."

1:08:42.752 --> 1:08:44.787
Now Clayton, I know this is the
first time that you've talked

1:08:44.854 --> 1:08:47.123
to any of the women
since you're done filming.

1:08:47.190 --> 1:08:49.158
How are you feeling?

1:08:49.225 --> 1:08:51.361
- You know, it's--
I think it's really good

1:08:51.427 --> 1:08:53.062
that you guys are
holding me accountable.

1:08:53.129 --> 1:08:55.598
I need that.
And while it is tough,

1:08:55.665 --> 1:08:58.134
I'm happy that we are
having these discussions.

1:08:58.201 --> 1:08:59.969
- Clayton, in your defense--
and I want to speak

1:09:00.036 --> 1:09:02.905
in your defense, like,
honestly, I've dated toxicity.

1:09:02.972 --> 1:09:04.941
I've been with toxicity before.

1:09:05.008 --> 1:09:07.710
- Raise your hand if you have.
- And it's hard as hell.

1:09:07.777 --> 1:09:10.780
It's hard as hell
to distinguish what's toxic

1:09:10.847 --> 1:09:12.415
and what's really for you.

1:09:12.482 --> 1:09:14.017
And I've been in that
situation, and me and you have

1:09:14.083 --> 1:09:17.186
had that conversation about
dating narcissists, right?

1:09:17.253 --> 1:09:18.821
Like, do I think
Shanae's a narcissist?

1:09:18.888 --> 1:09:20.723
That's not--
that's not for me to say.

1:09:20.790 --> 1:09:22.091
You know,
and at the end of the day,

1:09:22.158 --> 1:09:25.628
I think that you're
navigating dating 30 people.

1:09:25.695 --> 1:09:27.296
I couldn't do that, honestly.

1:09:27.363 --> 1:09:29.232
Hats off to you
for navigating it

1:09:29.298 --> 1:09:31.034
the best way
that you could navigate it.

1:09:31.100 --> 1:09:33.803
And that's--
and that's what my two cents.

1:09:33.870 --> 1:09:35.471
- Okay.

1:09:35.538 --> 1:09:36.806
Clayton,
I know you had a very,

1:09:36.873 --> 1:09:38.741
very special relationship
with Serene.

1:09:38.808 --> 1:09:41.511
A lot of amazing memories.

1:09:41.577 --> 1:09:43.913
What's it feel like
seeing Serene

1:09:43.980 --> 1:09:46.082
back here for the first time?

1:09:46.149 --> 1:09:47.583
- [sighs]
Yeah.

1:09:47.650 --> 1:09:50.453
I--you know, Serene, I--

1:09:50.520 --> 1:09:53.489
I played back
the way things ended

1:09:53.556 --> 1:09:55.458
a lot of times in my head,

1:09:55.525 --> 1:09:58.961
and it really crushed me with
the question that you asked.

1:09:59.028 --> 1:10:01.064
Right before we parted ways,
you said,

1:10:01.130 --> 1:10:03.099
"Was it because of
what I said?"

1:10:03.166 --> 1:10:05.535
And that made me sick
to my stomach,

1:10:05.601 --> 1:10:09.906
because I was holding back
my emotions and my feelings

1:10:09.972 --> 1:10:12.608
and expressing them
towards the women,

1:10:12.675 --> 1:10:14.811
including you.

1:10:14.877 --> 1:10:17.914
And after you said that,
I felt that it was almost

1:10:17.980 --> 1:10:20.083
as if you felt maybe
invalidated in that moment,

1:10:20.149 --> 1:10:22.318
that, hey, I gave so much.

1:10:22.385 --> 1:10:24.620
But I didn't
give you that back.

1:10:24.687 --> 1:10:27.223
And going forward, I--
I told myself,

1:10:27.290 --> 1:10:29.158
I am no longer gonna hold back,

1:10:29.225 --> 1:10:33.730
because I don't want
that next woman questioning

1:10:33.796 --> 1:10:36.766
what we have because I wasn't
able to open up to them.

1:10:36.833 --> 1:10:39.836
And so I really feel terrible,
and I want to apologize

1:10:39.902 --> 1:10:42.605
because I hope you don't
close off going forward.

1:10:42.672 --> 1:10:44.574
You did everything right.
You did.

1:10:44.640 --> 1:10:47.310
And I just wish that
I would have opened up to you

1:10:47.376 --> 1:10:49.378
instead of having you be
the person to teach me that.

1:10:49.445 --> 1:10:51.247
- Mm.
- Thank you.

1:10:56.452 --> 1:10:58.855
You know, I-I don't want you
to be worried about me

1:10:58.921 --> 1:11:00.623
putting my walls back up,

1:11:00.690 --> 1:11:06.162
because I-I know that
in order to get what I want

1:11:06.229 --> 1:11:07.997
and find that person for me,

1:11:08.064 --> 1:11:10.666
I have to
keep being vulnerable.

1:11:10.733 --> 1:11:12.802
But I do appreciate
you saying that.

1:11:12.869 --> 1:11:14.203
It does mean a lot.

1:11:16.939 --> 1:11:18.441
- I have something
I want to say.

1:11:18.508 --> 1:11:20.710
I know you got a lot
of criticism today,

1:11:20.777 --> 1:11:24.413
most of which
is really deserved, but, um...

1:11:24.480 --> 1:11:26.749
[laughter]
But for me actually,

1:11:26.816 --> 1:11:30.787
watching it back,
I saw and came to appreciate

1:11:30.853 --> 1:11:33.623
a lot of your really
good qualities.

1:11:33.689 --> 1:11:35.491
And I actually found myself,
like,

1:11:35.558 --> 1:11:39.595
more and more attracted
to you with each episode.

1:11:39.662 --> 1:11:42.665
Um--
- Kira's down.

1:11:42.732 --> 1:11:45.001
- So, you know,
I don't know if you're engaged,

1:11:45.067 --> 1:11:47.904
but if you're not,
and you're single...

1:11:47.970 --> 1:11:49.305
[laughter]

1:11:49.372 --> 1:11:50.873
Just know I'm single too.

1:11:50.940 --> 1:11:53.476
- Kira.
- Kira.

1:11:53.543 --> 1:11:55.945
Respect, Kira.
- Wow.

1:11:56.012 --> 1:11:58.381
[applause]

1:11:58.447 --> 1:11:59.916
- I respect the boldness.

1:11:59.982 --> 1:12:01.250
I respect the boldness
for what it is.

1:12:01.317 --> 1:12:04.220
- You will get bold here
on "The Bachelor."

1:12:04.287 --> 1:12:07.223
All right, we finally reached
that point in the night,

1:12:07.290 --> 1:12:08.357
so why don't we just
lighten up the mood

1:12:08.424 --> 1:12:09.458
a little bit
with a little laughter.

1:12:09.525 --> 1:12:10.660
You want to do that?
- Let's do it.

1:12:10.726 --> 1:12:12.528
- It's the best medicine.
It's finally here.

1:12:12.595 --> 1:12:15.131
You've been asking for this.
We've got them for you.

1:12:15.198 --> 1:12:16.999
Is everybody ready
for blooper time?

1:12:17.066 --> 1:12:18.668
[cheers and applause]

1:12:18.734 --> 1:12:19.902
Let's go.

1:12:21.771 --> 1:12:23.739
- Ooh, I love popping these.

1:12:23.806 --> 1:12:25.007
Or do you want
to do the honors?

1:12:25.074 --> 1:12:26.776
- No, no.
You can do it.

1:12:26.843 --> 1:12:28.211
- Okay.

1:12:28.277 --> 1:12:29.512
I've become a real pro at this.

1:12:29.579 --> 1:12:30.847
And honestly...
- Hm?

1:12:30.913 --> 1:12:32.181
- This is gonna
be actually fun--

1:12:32.248 --> 1:12:34.183
Oh, my--

1:12:34.250 --> 1:12:37.220
[both laughing]
- I just unscrewed that...

1:12:37.286 --> 1:12:40.289
Whew, good thing I had
that facing away.

1:12:40.356 --> 1:12:41.824
Could have been terrible.

1:12:41.891 --> 1:12:43.993
- Like, that was strong too.
- That one was.

1:12:44.060 --> 1:12:46.996
Normally it doesn't do that
when I pull it off.

1:12:48.097 --> 1:12:49.699
- Tell me what you think.
Oh--damn.

1:12:49.765 --> 1:12:52.034
- [muffled]
- Why are you biting so hard?

1:12:52.101 --> 1:12:54.136
- Okay...
- Oh...oh--

1:12:54.203 --> 1:12:56.005
[laughing]
- That was gross. Cut that out.

1:12:56.072 --> 1:12:58.040
Oh. What's going on?

1:12:59.709 --> 1:13:00.643
Oh--

1:13:00.710 --> 1:13:02.912
[laughing]
Oh, my gosh.

1:13:02.979 --> 1:13:04.947
Okay--no.

1:13:05.014 --> 1:13:06.015
- I'm from the marsh.

1:13:06.082 --> 1:13:08.417
We got skeeters,
we got roaches.

1:13:08.484 --> 1:13:09.952
- Ooh--
- What?

1:13:10.019 --> 1:13:11.087
- [screams]

1:13:11.153 --> 1:13:12.321
- [gasps]
- Oh!

1:13:12.388 --> 1:13:13.556
- Did you see that?
- [laughing]

1:13:13.623 --> 1:13:16.392
- What is it?
- A bug hit me.

1:13:16.459 --> 1:13:18.327
[buzzing]
- Oh--ooh.

1:13:18.394 --> 1:13:20.429
[squealing]

1:13:20.863 --> 1:13:21.831
I don't know.

"Women Tell All."

1:17:45.694 --> 1:17:47.263
But you're not in the clear
just yet.

1:17:47.329 --> 1:17:49.532
I do wanna fast forward
to what we're gonna see

1:17:49.598 --> 1:17:50.966
coming up here in the finale.

1:17:51.033 --> 1:17:53.068
You fell in love
with three women:

1:17:53.135 --> 1:17:55.538
Rachel, Gabby, and Susie.

1:17:55.604 --> 1:17:57.006
Did you ever think
that you were gonna

1:17:57.072 --> 1:17:58.741
end up in a situation
like that

1:17:58.807 --> 1:18:00.843
when your journey as
the Bachelor started?

1:18:00.910 --> 1:18:03.479
- No.
I remember when I came in,

1:18:03.546 --> 1:18:04.847
I said, "Absolutely not.

1:18:04.914 --> 1:18:06.448
"I'm not gonna fall in love
with multiple people.

1:18:06.515 --> 1:18:08.450
That's a recipe for disaster."

1:18:08.517 --> 1:18:11.954
And then when I started to

1:18:12.021 --> 1:18:14.623
allow my emotions to come out,
I did.

1:18:14.690 --> 1:18:17.993
I fell for all three,
and it just happened.

1:18:18.060 --> 1:18:19.461
- You've been very open...
- I do wanna say...

1:18:19.528 --> 1:18:20.462
- And honest about--

1:18:20.529 --> 1:18:22.865
- Just really quickly,
you know,

1:18:22.932 --> 1:18:25.301
speaking on the fact that you
fell in love with three women,

1:18:25.367 --> 1:18:28.304
you know, you obviously know
that we are all very close.

1:18:28.370 --> 1:18:29.838
All of us women are very close.

1:18:29.905 --> 1:18:33.309
And a few of us have been able
to hear about what goes down

1:18:33.375 --> 1:18:34.777
and how messy it gets.

1:18:34.843 --> 1:18:37.813
And I wanna know exactly,
you know,

1:18:37.880 --> 1:18:39.815
who are you to act
a certain way

1:18:39.882 --> 1:18:41.217
and treat these women
a certain way

1:18:41.283 --> 1:18:43.419
and subject them to this
kind of behavior of yours?

1:18:43.485 --> 1:18:45.921
Like, what did they do
to deserve it?

1:18:45.988 --> 1:18:47.223
- Again, I couldn't prep
for it.

1:18:47.289 --> 1:18:48.557
I just had to go into it

1:18:48.624 --> 1:18:51.427
and react the way that
I thought was appropriate.

1:18:51.493 --> 1:18:55.698
And I understand, again,
that what I did...

1:18:55.764 --> 1:18:57.967
I think it's important for me,
again, to learn from it

1:18:58.033 --> 1:18:59.101
and I am learning from it.

1:18:59.168 --> 1:19:01.470
But it was with no
bad intentions.

1:19:01.537 --> 1:19:04.406
And I had to let my emotions
come out and that's--

1:19:04.473 --> 1:19:07.676
unfortunately, it wasn't as
straightforward as I had hoped.

1:19:07.743 --> 1:19:10.346
- Um, I am in a unique position

1:19:10.412 --> 1:19:12.848

a lot of things,

1:19:12.915 --> 1:19:14.917
