00:29.154 --> 00:30.447
Hey!

00:32.782 --> 00:33.825
Wait.

00:34.409 --> 00:36.244
Hey! Stop!

00:37.495 --> 00:38.538
Hey!

00:40.874 --> 00:42.876
Hey! Stop!

00:45.795 --> 00:46.713
Please!

00:47.297 --> 00:49.716
-Please come back! I'm right here!

00:49.799 --> 00:51.593
Please! Come back!

02:23.393 --> 02:24.727
Come on.

02:54.299 --> 02:55.466
Mom?

02:55.550 --> 02:57.760
Hi, sunflower.

02:57.844 --> 02:59.179
I missed you.

03:01.472 --> 03:04.017
Where have you been?

03:09.731 --> 03:13.276
It's been so lonely
down here without you.

03:14.569 --> 03:17.155
I have to get out of here.

03:18.198 --> 03:19.657
We're together again.

03:21.659 --> 03:23.786
You found me.

03:44.515 --> 03:45.558
Mom?

03:52.273 --> 03:53.191
Mom?

03:57.570 --> 03:58.529
What?

03:59.530 --> 04:00.573
I'm hungry.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.368
Ask your father.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.371
He's at work.

04:09.666 --> 04:10.583
Mom.

04:14.504 --> 04:15.880
-No!

04:18.549 --> 04:19.550
Liv?

04:21.469 --> 04:23.221
Been looking all over for you.

04:23.846 --> 04:25.682
-Where've you been?

04:26.266 --> 04:27.892
Were you sleeping in here?

04:27.976 --> 04:30.103
Just closed my eyes for a second.

04:30.186 --> 04:31.646
Will you turn that off?

04:36.776 --> 04:37.902
Is everything okay?

04:37.986 --> 04:40.822
Yeah. Yeah… why-- why wouldn't it be?

04:40.905 --> 04:43.074
You're late. Hearing's in 20 minutes.

04:47.078 --> 04:49.747
The hearing. Yeah, right. Right.

04:50.832 --> 04:52.333
You're still coming out tonight, right?

04:54.085 --> 04:55.920
This underground music thing?

04:56.838 --> 04:57.672
Right.

04:59.382 --> 05:00.300
Right.

05:00.925 --> 05:03.219
Right, that happens tonight.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.887
Yeah, that happens tonight.

05:05.596 --> 05:08.349
I promise I won't try
to hold your hand or anything.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.561
Are you sure you're all right? You…

05:11.644 --> 05:12.812
You look a little lost.

05:12.895 --> 05:15.523
I'm fine. I… I'll be right there. I just…

05:15.606 --> 05:17.817
I… I… I want to get something to eat.

05:17.900 --> 05:19.944
-Eighteen minutes.
-I'm starving.

05:26.701 --> 05:29.912
Danny! Stay out of my snack drawer!

05:30.705 --> 05:32.498
-Goddamn it.

05:46.846 --> 05:47.972
Danny?

05:56.147 --> 05:57.231
Hello?

05:59.942 --> 06:02.862
Hey, do you know where everyone is?

06:06.657 --> 06:07.575
Hey.

06:09.285 --> 06:11.204
Hey! Wait!

06:11.287 --> 06:12.622
Hey!

06:22.465 --> 06:23.549
Ruth!

06:23.633 --> 06:25.093
-What's going on?
-It's a fucking fire drill.

06:25.176 --> 06:26.969
I don't know how it snuck up on us.

06:27.053 --> 06:28.221
Hopefully, the client still shows.

06:28.304 --> 06:30.890
Are you ready? Are you nervous?

06:30.973 --> 06:31.974
You're gonna do great.

06:32.600 --> 06:33.768
Is that what you're wearing?

06:35.061 --> 06:36.270
I can't read this.

06:36.354 --> 06:37.688
Copier's broken, sorry.

06:38.189 --> 06:41.943
-I'm just going to grab a glass of water--
-Fifteen minutes!

06:44.362 --> 06:48.324
Hey! What is it, like, take your kid
to work day or something?

06:52.912 --> 06:54.163
Are you lost?

06:54.747 --> 06:56.499
Do you know where your mother is?

07:00.128 --> 07:01.087
Mom?

07:01.671 --> 07:02.713
Mom!

07:05.675 --> 07:07.427
Where'd you go, Mom?

07:09.345 --> 07:10.304
Mom?

07:12.682 --> 07:13.683
Mom.

07:15.685 --> 07:18.104
It's okay, girasol.

07:18.187 --> 07:20.273
It was just a bad dream.

07:20.356 --> 07:22.024
I'm here now.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.909
Please, help me.

07:58.144 --> 08:01.355
You can chip away,
but you'll never get out from under it.

08:02.023 --> 08:03.858
No matter how hard you try.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.181
She's gone, Liv.

08:35.264 --> 08:36.599
Where?

08:36.682 --> 08:39.227
I don't know. She didn't say.

08:41.771 --> 08:43.231
This is not your fault, Liv.

08:44.982 --> 08:46.067
I'm hungry.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.030
This has nothing to do with you.

08:53.741 --> 08:55.201
I'm thirsty.

09:56.637 --> 09:59.682
Danny. Fuck.

09:59.765 --> 10:01.934
-Will you get off my dress?
-Hearing's in 12 minutes.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.894
You're not gonna flake
on me tonight, are you?

10:03.978 --> 10:04.854
I don't know.

10:04.937 --> 10:07.440
-Have you seen a little girl around?
-A little girl? No.

10:07.523 --> 10:08.983
What do you mean you don't know?

10:09.066 --> 10:11.152
I mean, I don't know!
I'm kind of busy right now.

10:11.235 --> 10:12.737
You said you were into this.

10:14.655 --> 10:18.743
Why is there no food in this fridge?
Who took my fucking lunch?

10:18.826 --> 10:22.038
Why is it so hard to just say
you'll show up, and then show up?

10:22.121 --> 10:25.875
I don't know. Because I am a human person
who works an 80-hour workweek.

10:25.958 --> 10:28.502
I don't have time to go out every night.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.963
Are you familiar with the song
"Cat's in the Cradle"?

10:32.089 --> 10:34.383
Yes, I'm familiar with the song
"Cat's in the Cradle."

10:34.467 --> 10:36.510
Well, you're the father and I'm the son.

10:36.594 --> 10:39.263
And if you don't take time
to play catch with me right now,

10:39.347 --> 10:41.557
I might not be around later
when you're retired.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.143
Uh, I don't love this allegory for us.

10:44.226 --> 10:45.519
Come out tonight.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.730
I'm late. I have to go.

10:47.813 --> 10:48.814
Eleven minutes.

10:48.898 --> 10:51.108
If you don't show up,
I'm coming to find you.

10:52.276 --> 10:53.527
Where are you going?

11:36.153 --> 11:37.238
Hey.

11:37.321 --> 11:38.406
Sorry.

11:38.489 --> 11:39.865
What did I tell you?

11:39.949 --> 11:40.950
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to--

11:41.033 --> 11:44.662
What is the only thing more important
than not interrupting me when I'm working?

11:44.745 --> 11:46.205
I'm… I'm sorry.

11:46.789 --> 11:49.709
Dancing. Dancing!

11:49.792 --> 11:52.545
Having fun!

12:02.930 --> 12:04.682
-Come on.

12:04.765 --> 12:06.058
Like this!

12:06.142 --> 12:07.435
It's okay.

12:07.518 --> 12:08.853
-Go ahead.

12:14.191 --> 12:15.234
Go ahead.

12:15.317 --> 12:16.235
Yes!

12:17.820 --> 12:19.280
More!

12:19.363 --> 12:20.656
More!

12:20.740 --> 12:22.324
Bigger!

12:22.408 --> 12:23.367
-Yes!

12:24.034 --> 12:26.203
Yes!

12:27.288 --> 12:28.330
Yes!

12:28.414 --> 12:31.208
My daughter is a genius!

12:38.883 --> 12:40.134
-Wait.

12:42.386 --> 12:43.304
Stop!

12:50.895 --> 12:53.022
I can't do it.

12:53.105 --> 12:54.857
I can't get out.

12:55.733 --> 12:59.695
You've always made everything
so hard on yourself.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.699
Ever since you were a little girl.

13:04.909 --> 13:05.743
I'm…

13:06.869 --> 13:10.956
so… fucking thirsty.

13:14.251 --> 13:18.214
Everything the long way around.

13:23.302 --> 13:27.807
Even when the answer
was right in front of you.

13:32.228 --> 13:34.897
There's always a way out.

13:38.651 --> 13:39.527
No.

13:42.780 --> 13:44.073
-Liv.
-No!

13:44.156 --> 13:46.492
-You have to eat.
-Go fuck yourself!

13:46.575 --> 13:48.077
Liv. Liv!

13:49.036 --> 13:49.870
Liv!

13:51.205 --> 13:52.289
Liv.

13:52.373 --> 13:53.457
Liv?

13:53.541 --> 13:54.458
Stop!

13:54.542 --> 13:56.627
-Liv!
-I hate you!

13:56.710 --> 13:58.879
-Mom was right!
-Open this!

13:58.963 --> 14:01.215
You just want to control everything!

14:01.298 --> 14:03.509
Liv. No. You don't yell at me!

14:03.592 --> 14:05.678
You don't slam the door at me,
you hear me?

14:05.761 --> 14:06.929
You want me to leave too?

14:07.012 --> 14:09.265
Is that what you want me to do? Huh!

14:09.348 --> 14:10.516
Well, too bad!

14:10.599 --> 14:11.642
'Cause I'm still here!

14:11.725 --> 14:12.893
I'm not the one who left.

14:12.977 --> 14:14.353
I'm still here!

14:14.436 --> 14:17.231
You can hate me all you want,
and I'll be here!

14:17.314 --> 14:20.025
You're stuck with me,
whether you like it or not, Liv!

14:20.109 --> 14:21.986
Go away!

14:22.069 --> 14:23.445
Just go away!

14:35.791 --> 14:37.126
In this house,

14:38.377 --> 14:40.379
we make our beds…

14:41.130 --> 14:43.007
…every day, Liv.

14:44.508 --> 14:45.676
You understand me?

15:13.662 --> 15:16.165
You know why
there's stars in the sky, Liv?

15:16.999 --> 15:17.833
Why?

15:21.128 --> 15:23.339
So, we can always find our way home.

15:45.402 --> 15:46.278
Dad?

15:48.906 --> 15:49.949
Dad?

15:53.285 --> 15:54.703
It's okay, Liv.

15:56.080 --> 15:59.708
I'm still here. I promise.

16:02.670 --> 16:05.547
I think it's time for him
to start letting go.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.134
But he won't do it
unless you tell him to.

16:10.844 --> 16:12.680
You have to tell him it's okay.

16:17.518 --> 16:18.519
No.

16:19.269 --> 16:21.438
I understand you're feeling a lot of pain.

16:21.939 --> 16:24.692
Why don't you go fuck yourself?
How about that?

16:25.359 --> 16:26.318
Get out.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.070
Miss Rivera.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.530
Get the fuck out.

16:38.831 --> 16:41.500
Liv. Liv!

18:13.258 --> 18:14.259
Hey.

18:14.343 --> 18:15.844
-You caught me.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.179
That club was crazy, huh?

18:17.262 --> 18:18.764
My ears are still ringing, are yours?

18:19.431 --> 18:20.849
I thought you'd left.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.392
Nope. Still here.

18:23.435 --> 18:24.978
Where do you keep your salt and pepper?

18:25.062 --> 18:26.313
What are you doing?

18:26.396 --> 18:28.816
It's called breakfast.
Some people are pretty into it.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.236
-Danny.
-Hmm.

18:34.321 --> 18:35.322
No.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.032
Really?

18:38.367 --> 18:39.701
Aah!

18:39.785 --> 18:41.036
Here we go.

18:41.870 --> 18:44.498
Weird place for them, but no judgment.

18:56.009 --> 18:57.302
I have to work.

18:57.386 --> 18:58.804
I have to file this motion by--

18:58.887 --> 19:01.348
Which is why I have to make you
this delicious meal.

19:01.431 --> 19:04.518
'Cause otherwise, you won't eat.
I know you.

19:04.601 --> 19:08.605
And food is actually quite high
in a man's desire to eat.

19:10.732 --> 19:12.276
You don't have to do this.

19:12.359 --> 19:14.486
And yet I am. How great am I, huh?

19:15.863 --> 19:19.950
Also, your potatoes
were like growing other potatoes.

19:20.033 --> 19:22.327
When's the last time you saw
a supermarket from the inside?

19:22.411 --> 19:25.164
-Danny, we can't just--
-Wait. Taste, taste this.

19:25.247 --> 19:26.540
Careful, it's hot.

19:33.922 --> 19:35.090
Good, right?

19:59.531 --> 20:02.034
Stop distracting me. It's not done yet.

20:15.589 --> 20:16.965
Why are you doing this?

20:19.051 --> 20:20.135
I love you.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.348
I love you.

20:30.646 --> 20:31.688
Be good.

20:35.817 --> 20:37.152
I have to go.

20:55.003 --> 20:56.630
Did you hear what I just said?

20:59.466 --> 21:01.843
I… have to go, I'm late.

21:04.554 --> 21:06.098
What are you talking about, Liv?

21:06.181 --> 21:07.516
Look, you don't have to do this.

21:07.599 --> 21:10.894
The-- the whole, like, cooking breakfast
and sticking around.

21:11.478 --> 21:12.688
You don't have to do any of it.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.695
We just got fucked up
and made another dumb mistake.

21:19.778 --> 21:22.281
-It's not gonna happen again.
-Who says it was a mistake?

21:22.364 --> 21:24.950
And you don't have to rush out.
Just lock the door when you're done.

21:25.033 --> 21:27.452
Who says it was a mistake
or that I want to leave?

21:27.536 --> 21:28.954
I'm not saying that.

21:36.044 --> 21:38.463
I like you. A lot.

21:38.547 --> 21:42.175
And-- and I-- I think you like me,
so what's the problem?

21:50.976 --> 21:53.854
You're just going to leave eventually,
so let's just get this over with.

21:54.354 --> 21:55.731
No, I'm not.

22:06.700 --> 22:07.909
Oh, fuck!

22:09.536 --> 22:11.079
You're allowed to be happy.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.290
We both are.

22:24.718 --> 22:25.886
I have to go.

23:21.274 --> 23:22.609
Why are you doing this?

23:22.692 --> 23:24.152
What are you so scared of?

23:24.236 --> 23:26.071
You know what? Fuck this.

23:26.154 --> 23:27.572
I don't have to leave, you do.

23:27.656 --> 23:28.865
Get out.

23:31.535 --> 23:33.537
Get out! Get the fuck out!

23:41.169 --> 23:42.337
All right.

23:42.963 --> 23:46.550
How much longer
are we expected to wait, Miss Rivera?

23:51.555 --> 23:52.556
I…

23:53.515 --> 23:55.100
beg your pardon, Your Honor?

23:55.183 --> 23:58.728
Miss Rivera, I think it's time
you cut your losses here.

23:59.771 --> 24:02.774
You tried. You did your best.
There's no shame in that.

24:03.525 --> 24:06.069
No one's gonna fault you
for calling it a day.

24:07.446 --> 24:10.574
And I think your client
would agree with me.

24:28.800 --> 24:29.759
It's okay.

24:38.059 --> 24:39.478
Why did you leave?

24:43.982 --> 24:45.901
It's not your fault.

24:47.694 --> 24:49.404
You did your best.

24:52.491 --> 24:54.451
It's okay to let go.

24:59.581 --> 25:00.832
Is that what you did?

25:04.044 --> 25:05.086
Let go?

25:10.842 --> 25:13.094
I know you think I abandoned you.

25:14.471 --> 25:15.555
But I didn't.

25:16.515 --> 25:17.641
I saved you.

25:19.851 --> 25:21.311
I saved all of us.

25:23.730 --> 25:25.273
I felt lost when I left you,

25:25.357 --> 25:29.069
but it was the only way I knew
how to take care of you anymore.

25:31.613 --> 25:32.739
And look at you.

25:34.950 --> 25:36.910
Look how strong you are now.

25:41.790 --> 25:43.917
It's too late for excuses.

26:13.905 --> 26:15.782
-We're so much alike.

26:15.865 --> 26:18.577
You see things sometimes, don't you?

26:18.660 --> 26:20.662
Things that aren't there.

26:20.745 --> 26:21.871
Fuck you.

26:24.916 --> 26:26.084
Go away.

26:27.961 --> 26:29.087
You don't mean that.

26:30.505 --> 26:31.840
You need me.

26:31.923 --> 26:34.676
No! I don't.

26:36.511 --> 26:38.722
I needed you then. Not now.

26:39.764 --> 26:41.474
Where the fuck were you?

26:42.267 --> 26:43.518
I need you?

26:43.602 --> 26:47.272
Because of you, I've spent my whole life
in fucking armor,

26:47.355 --> 26:49.691
making sure no one gets close
enough to hurt me!

26:50.775 --> 26:53.653
Making sure I don't need anything
from anyone!

26:56.239 --> 26:57.198
I'm done.

26:58.491 --> 27:00.201
You be fucking good.

27:05.415 --> 27:08.752
I am… nothing like you.

27:09.753 --> 27:10.879
And you know why?

27:11.713 --> 27:14.549
Because I don't give up!

27:44.954 --> 27:45.914
Bye, Mom.

27:52.462 --> 27:53.296
Liv.

27:55.131 --> 27:56.591
Come back here, querida!

27:56.675 --> 27:57.884
I'm sorry.

27:59.386 --> 28:00.720
Liv.

28:00.804 --> 28:04.307
Come on,
you're going to hurt yourself, silly.

28:04.391 --> 28:06.142
Come back here right now.

28:06.851 --> 28:08.520
Do you hear me?

28:08.603 --> 28:10.397
Come back here!

28:11.648 --> 28:14.192
Don't leave me down here by myself!

28:17.570 --> 28:19.656
Liv!
