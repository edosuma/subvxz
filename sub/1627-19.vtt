NARRATOR:
Previously on Once Upon A Time.

00:03.421 --> 00:06.037
DAVID: The Sheriff found a heart
in your jewelry box.

00:06.299 --> 00:07.914
The weapon was found
in your apartment.

00:08.050 --> 00:09.085
I didn't kill Kathryn!

00:09.385 --> 00:10.795
You think my book is real?

00:10.928 --> 00:13.089
I'm a believer.
And I want to help others see the light.

00:13.222 --> 00:14.177
But I already believe.

00:14.265 --> 00:15.254
I'm here for Emma.

00:18.728 --> 00:19.717
Kathryn?

00:43.294 --> 00:44.659
(GRUNTING)

(GROANS)

01:11.864 --> 01:13.400
Hey, you there?

01:13.491 --> 01:14.651
Good.

01:15.243 --> 01:18.326
This is taking too long.
We need to accelerate the plan.

01:19.580 --> 01:20.990
It's almost 9:00.

01:21.499 --> 01:24.081
You all set? You know what to do?

01:24.168 --> 01:26.284
Operation Cobra is always ready.

01:26.379 --> 01:27.869
ljust...

01:28.005 --> 01:28.960
You just what?

01:29.048 --> 01:32.256
I don't understand what this has to do
with getting Emma to believe.

01:33.844 --> 01:36.927
Sometimes other priorities
assert themselves.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.714
Can you handle a little improvisation?

01:39.850 --> 01:41.841
Yeah. Can you?

01:43.062 --> 01:44.051
We're a go.

01:52.196 --> 01:53.185
(DINGS)

01:58.703 --> 01:59.909
Hey, Mr. Gold.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.575
Good morning, Henry.
What can I do for you?

02:04.083 --> 02:06.199
I want to get a gift for Ms. Blanchard.

02:06.294 --> 02:07.374
Oh! I see.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.201
Since she didn't kill that woman.

02:09.297 --> 02:10.457
Good thinking.

02:11.882 --> 02:13.543
-HENRY: Are these bells?
-(DOOR CREAKING)

02:13.634 --> 02:14.794
(BELLS TINKLING)

02:14.885 --> 02:15.840
Cool.

02:15.928 --> 02:17.464
GOLD: See anything you fancy?

02:17.638 --> 02:22.302
HENRY: It should be something special,
like pretty-sounding, but with authority.

02:22.393 --> 02:23.974
GOLD: You're asking a lot from a bell.

02:25.730 --> 02:27.846
HENRY: I like the first one
the best so far.

02:28.065 --> 02:30.647
GOLD: Sometimes it's best to go
with one's first instinct.

02:30.735 --> 02:31.975
(BELL DlNGlNG)

02:32.069 --> 02:33.605
HENRY: This one's good.
How much is it?

02:33.904 --> 02:34.893
GOLD: The price is marked.

02:35.614 --> 02:39.323
HENRY: Wow. I was thinking
more like five dollars?

02:39.618 --> 02:42.075
-GOLD: l have some tin whistles.
-(BELLS CLINKING)

02:44.623 --> 02:45.783
May I help you?

02:47.918 --> 02:48.907
Yeah.

02:50.129 --> 02:52.495
I'm looking for some maps.
I'm a bit of a collector.

02:52.590 --> 02:54.330
Yes.

02:54.467 --> 02:56.674
Well, there's maps through in the shop.
This is my office.

02:57.470 --> 02:58.585
I thought this was the entrance.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.010
It's not.

03:00.973 --> 03:03.089
The shop is through there.

03:20.826 --> 03:23.613
Emma, come on in. Look who's awake.

03:23.704 --> 03:24.784
EMMA: Kathryn, hi.

03:24.872 --> 03:27.534
Listen, I don't want
to take a lot of your time.

03:27.625 --> 03:29.490
But do you remember what happened?

03:29.627 --> 03:31.242
I don't know much.

03:31.337 --> 03:36.331
l was in a car accident
and I remember the airbag going off.

03:37.134 --> 03:40.422
And the next thing I knew,
I was in the dark, in some basement.

03:40.513 --> 03:43.129
I didn't see anyone,
but there was food and water.

03:43.224 --> 03:45.340
And then, I guess I was drugged?

03:45.434 --> 03:47.425
Yeah. We're still trying
to flush that out of your system.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.011
And then I woke up in a field
at the edge of town

03:50.106 --> 03:52.142
and I started walking.

03:52.233 --> 03:53.268
That was it.

03:53.359 --> 03:55.566
You saw no one?
You didn't hear a voice?

03:55.653 --> 03:57.860
Smell perfume? Cologne? Anything?

03:57.947 --> 04:00.108
Nothing. No. I'm sorry.

04:00.199 --> 04:01.655
I wish I could help.

04:01.867 --> 04:03.403
Especially since...

04:05.037 --> 04:08.404
While I was gone,
you thought I was dead?

04:08.499 --> 04:10.615
Your DNA matched the heart we found.

04:10.709 --> 04:13.166
They're grilling everybody
down at the hospital lab,

04:13.254 --> 04:14.960
to see who doctored the DNA results.

04:15.047 --> 04:17.129
Why would anyone do this?

04:17.466 --> 04:20.754
I think someone was trying
to frame Mary Margaret.

04:20.845 --> 04:21.880
But why?

04:22.012 --> 04:24.879
I mean,
who would do something like that?

04:29.103 --> 04:30.183
You broke our deal.

04:31.939 --> 04:36.057
I broke one deal in my life, dear.
And it certainly wasn't this one.

04:36.318 --> 04:39.810
Kathryn was supposed to die, and
Mary Margaret was to get the blame.

04:40.030 --> 04:43.443
Yeah, murder seems so much worse
here, though, doesn't it?

04:43.534 --> 04:47.447
You can'tjust turn someone into a snail
and then step on them, can you?

04:47.830 --> 04:50.037
You didn't say, "Kill her."

04:50.124 --> 04:52.831
We agreed that something tragic
should happen to her.

04:52.960 --> 04:55.292
Now, abduction is tragic.

04:55.379 --> 04:57.119
The intent was perfectly clear.

04:57.214 --> 04:59.466
Oh! Let's not talk about intent.
Intent is meaningless.

04:59.550 --> 05:00.630
Intent is everything.

05:00.718 --> 05:01.707
Please.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.389
This is going to raise
all kinds of questions

05:09.477 --> 05:12.594
about where she was
and how the test results were fake.

05:12.730 --> 05:14.391
Oh, yes,

05:15.774 --> 05:18.151
and who put the key in her cell.

05:20.946 --> 05:22.811
It's all going to lead to me, isn't it?

05:23.699 --> 05:25.314
You bastard!

05:26.368 --> 05:28.495
This doesn't make any sense.

05:28.579 --> 05:32.618
You and l, we've been in this
together from the start.

05:32.791 --> 05:33.780
Oh! Have we?

05:33.876 --> 05:35.286
You created the curse for me,

05:35.377 --> 05:37.504
the curse that brought us here
and built all this.

05:37.588 --> 05:38.794
Yes, it's about time you said thank you.

05:38.881 --> 05:40.542
Why did you do it?

05:43.802 --> 05:46.544
Well, you're a smart woman,
Your Majesty.

05:47.723 --> 05:49.634
Figure it out.

06:08.494 --> 06:10.485
What are you doing
in the middle of the road, boy?

06:10.579 --> 06:11.614
I'm sorry! I...

06:11.747 --> 06:12.987
Hey, I know you.

06:14.792 --> 06:16.032
It's fine. It's fine.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.377
You know, it was the donkey's fault.

06:17.461 --> 06:19.247
You want chicken, or some eggs...

06:19.338 --> 06:20.418
That's all right. No.
I should probablyjust...

RUMPLESTILTSKIN: What's going on?

06:27.054 --> 06:28.635
It's nothing. It was my fault.

06:28.722 --> 06:30.053
I wasn't looking where I was going,

06:30.140 --> 06:32.051
but he says he's fine.

06:33.519 --> 06:35.635
I'm fine, Papa. Really.

06:35.729 --> 06:36.718
Are you sure, Bae?

06:36.814 --> 06:38.475
Yes. I'm fine.

06:41.193 --> 06:42.729
Well, I suppose it won't happen again.

06:42.820 --> 06:44.481
-It won't.
-No.

07:55.392 --> 07:57.769
I was trying to kiss you
on your forehead.

07:57.853 --> 07:59.764
It was meant to be sweet.

07:59.855 --> 08:01.311
(CHUCKLES) Well, thank you.

08:03.025 --> 08:04.856
It's good to see you.

Kathryn, I'm sorry.

08:10.074 --> 08:12.030
I'm sorry I lied to you.

08:13.327 --> 08:15.613
I'm sorry I cheated on you.

08:15.704 --> 08:17.660
I'm just so sorry for all this.

08:17.748 --> 08:19.329
David, it's okay.

08:19.416 --> 08:22.783
You know, what we had,
it wasn't it for you.

08:23.671 --> 08:25.878
Maybe for both of us.

08:25.964 --> 08:29.548

the first one to see it.

so I can get some rest.

I'm gonna give you that kiss
on the forehead now.

Would you like some?

just to welcome me home?

09:15.139 --> 09:16.629
You've got a lot of friends.

Getting caught in his office?
Not bad. I played it off.

-Did you find it?
-Nope.

09:33.824 --> 09:36.657
But I have a feeling it's gonna find me.

why don't you give her your present?

head home with David?

Your son.

10:38.931 --> 10:40.216
Yeah.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.389
Pretty much the hardest thing.

10:42.476 --> 10:45.092
Speaking of something
we weren't talking about, was it you?

10:45.187 --> 10:46.222
Was what me?

10:46.313 --> 10:48.019
Did you make Kathryn
suddenly materialize?

10:48.106 --> 10:49.812
Because it sure played that way to me.

10:49.900 --> 10:51.481
Was that the magic
you were going to work?

10:51.568 --> 10:54.275
Because if you kidnapped that poor,
innocent woman, just to let her go...

10:54.363 --> 10:57.275
Are you proposing I'm working
with Regina or against her?

10:57.366 --> 10:58.856
I don't know. Maybe diagonally.

10:58.951 --> 11:01.033
Well, you keep working on that one.

11:01.328 --> 11:04.365
My question is about something else.
What do you know about him?

11:04.498 --> 11:06.204
He goes by August. He's a writer.

11:06.291 --> 11:10.125
A typewriter wrapped in an enigma
wrapped in stubble. Why?

11:10.796 --> 11:12.957
He was poking around my shop today.

11:13.048 --> 11:16.040
"August Wayne Booth,"
clearly a false name.

11:16.510 --> 11:18.250
If there's one thing I know about,
it's names.

11:18.595 --> 11:20.460
Writers go by pseudonyms.
What does it matter?

11:20.556 --> 11:21.545
You trust him?

11:21.723 --> 11:22.803
Yeah.

11:23.433 --> 11:25.298
A lot more than I trust you.

11:44.454 --> 11:46.581
You can fetch our supper now, dearie.

11:53.130 --> 11:54.245
You killed that man.

11:54.381 --> 11:55.882
Well, you were hurt.

11:56.258 --> 11:58.044
Speaking of which...

12:00.387 --> 12:01.422
No.

12:02.472 --> 12:04.963
I don't want magic. It's just a scrape.

12:05.142 --> 12:07.133
Well, this will heal it.

12:08.770 --> 12:10.226
So will this.

12:12.941 --> 12:13.976
As you wish.

12:19.281 --> 12:21.897
You're different now.
You see it, don't you?

12:22.618 --> 12:23.983
You hurt people all the time.

12:27.331 --> 12:30.664
I created a truce in the Ogres war, Bae.

12:30.751 --> 12:33.834
I walked into the field of battle
and I made it stop.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.496
I led the children home!

12:38.175 --> 12:39.585
Surely a man who's saved
a thousand lives...

12:39.676 --> 12:41.007
ls done.

12:41.136 --> 12:43.092
A man who's saved a thousand lives
can be done with it.

12:43.180 --> 12:44.590
You can stop doing things.

12:45.807 --> 12:46.842
Ow!

12:47.809 --> 12:49.094
I can't.

12:49.186 --> 12:50.847
I need more power,

12:50.979 --> 12:52.435
so I can protect you.

12:52.522 --> 12:54.433
I wouldn't need protecting
if you didn't have power.

12:54.524 --> 12:55.775
Well, I can't get rid of it!

12:55.859 --> 12:56.848
Have you tried?

12:56.944 --> 12:58.024
Tned.

13:00.113 --> 13:05.983
Someone kills me with this,
then they gain the power.

13:06.536 --> 13:08.276
Now, you know that, Bae.

13:08.372 --> 13:09.578
Is that what you want?

13:09.706 --> 13:10.786
That's not what I want!

13:10.874 --> 13:12.830
ljust think there might be
other ways to get rid of the power.

13:12.918 --> 13:14.454
Have you looked for...

13:19.508 --> 13:21.715
Well, you look for other ways, Bae.

13:21.843 --> 13:23.708
But don't get your hopes up.

13:26.848 --> 13:27.928
Papa,

13:30.060 --> 13:32.142
if I find a way for you
to get rid of the power,

13:32.229 --> 13:35.721
a way that doesn't kill you or hurt me,
would you do it?

13:35.857 --> 13:36.846
It's not possible.

13:36.942 --> 13:38.432
If it was, would you do it?

13:38.568 --> 13:39.523
Don't you miss how it was?

13:39.611 --> 13:41.226
Are you really that unhappy, Bae?

13:42.656 --> 13:44.942
I can conjure anything you desire.

13:47.077 --> 13:48.942
Name it. What do you want?

13:49.663 --> 13:51.278
I want my father.

13:53.083 --> 13:55.916
All I want is your happiness, Bae.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.331
If you find a way,

14:00.298 --> 14:01.458
I'll do it.

14:06.179 --> 14:07.635
Good.

14:14.271 --> 14:15.511
The deal is struck.

14:16.273 --> 14:17.479
Struck.

14:26.825 --> 14:27.814
(CLICKS)

15:27.761 --> 15:28.750
Hey, Sidney.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.215
Emma. Hey.

15:32.849 --> 15:37.343
80 things certainly did work out.
Didn't they? For your friend.

15:37.479 --> 15:39.060
You told me you could help me
with Mary Margaret

15:39.189 --> 15:41.145
and I wanted to believe you.

15:41.233 --> 15:45.317
But eventually there are things
that even a blind sheriff

15:46.905 --> 15:48.065
cannot ignore.

15:48.156 --> 15:49.362
Is that a bug?

15:49.533 --> 15:51.524
Oh! For God's sake, Sidney, drop it.

15:52.077 --> 15:53.157
You fooled me,

15:53.245 --> 15:56.829
you spied on me and you reported it
all back to that sick, crazy woman.

15:56.915 --> 15:57.904
I can't even imagine
what she has on you

15:58.041 --> 15:59.030
but it must be something huge.

15:59.167 --> 16:00.452
She's a good mayor.

16:00.544 --> 16:02.284
She tried to get Mary Margaret
convicted of a murder

16:02.379 --> 16:03.539
that didn't even happen.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.537
You're in a lot of trouble.

16:05.757 --> 16:08.294
There is a DNA trail in a basement
of some house out there

16:08.385 --> 16:09.500
and I'm gonna find it.

16:09.594 --> 16:10.709
And she's gonna go away.

16:10.846 --> 16:13.212
Maybe. But I wouldn't bet against her.

16:14.266 --> 16:15.381
She's an amazing woman.

16:15.725 --> 16:17.056
Do you...

16:19.437 --> 16:20.768
Are you in love with her?

16:24.192 --> 16:25.773
Fine.

16:25.902 --> 16:26.891
Whatever.

16:27.028 --> 16:29.644
Here's the thing, before you know it,

16:29.739 --> 16:31.866
I will have that evidence.

16:31.950 --> 16:33.611
And you need to think long and hard.

16:33.743 --> 16:36.234
You can either help me
and help yourself,

16:36.413 --> 16:38.745
or you're gonna go down with her too.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.253
(SIGHS DEEPLY)

17:05.108 --> 17:06.973
(CHILDREN PLAYING)

17:17.996 --> 17:19.907
I have some business nearby
that would bore you.

17:19.998 --> 17:21.033
All right.

17:28.965 --> 17:30.296
Come on. Let's go.

17:49.611 --> 17:51.977
Baelfire?

17:52.113 --> 17:53.273
Careful, Morraine.

17:53.365 --> 17:55.447
You don't want to be seen with me.

17:55.533 --> 17:56.784
I'm dangerous.

17:57.827 --> 18:00.569
They're just scared of your papa.
But I'm not.

18:00.830 --> 18:02.366
You won't let him hurt me.

18:04.042 --> 18:05.748
I don't think he's so bad, anyway.

18:05.835 --> 18:08.417
I saw him on the battlefield,
when he stopped the fighting.

18:08.505 --> 18:09.836
It was like a miracle.

18:10.340 --> 18:12.331
Now he's getting worse every day.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.211
But he said he'll change back
if I find a way.

18:15.971 --> 18:17.632
I just don't know where to look.

18:20.267 --> 18:21.598
Reul Ghorm.

18:21.851 --> 18:23.057
What?

18:23.144 --> 18:24.850
I heard about it
when I was in the trenches.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.929
The other soldiers talked about it.

18:27.023 --> 18:29.355
Reul Ghorm is an ancient being
that rules the night.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.693
The original power.

18:30.819 --> 18:32.275
Bigger than Papa or worse than Papa?

18:32.362 --> 18:33.977
Bigger than anything.

18:35.949 --> 18:36.938
(RUSTLING)

18:37.033 --> 18:39.615
He's coming back. Good luck to you.

18:45.250 --> 18:46.831
Your friend didn't want to say hello?

18:47.210 --> 18:48.325
You frighten them.

18:48.420 --> 18:50.206
What is there to be frightened of, Bae?

18:50.297 --> 18:52.583
They'll get over that in time.

18:53.008 --> 18:54.418
You have stains on your boots.

18:57.721 --> 18:59.086
Oh, yes, that. Uh...

18:59.180 --> 19:01.171
We need a new maid.

19:01.683 --> 19:02.763
Gods, no.

19:03.143 --> 19:04.724
She heard us talking about the knife.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.553
She was mute!
She couldn't tell anyone!

19:09.024 --> 19:11.060
Even mutes can draw a picture.

19:20.952 --> 19:22.408
(INDISTINCT)

19:35.925 --> 19:38.132
GOLD: Mother Superior.

19:38.470 --> 19:40.051
Good afternoon.

19:41.514 --> 19:43.254
Our rent is paid in full.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.352
I'm not here about the rent.

19:46.770 --> 19:48.761
Good day to you, then.

19:50.106 --> 19:52.688
Tell me, that man who just left here,

19:53.943 --> 19:55.774
who did he say he was?

19:56.112 --> 19:57.443
What did he want?

19:57.781 --> 19:59.567
I don't have to tell you that.

20:00.241 --> 20:02.948
And I don't have to not double your rent.

20:03.078 --> 20:04.443
What did he want?

20:05.205 --> 20:07.036
Advice and counsel.

20:07.123 --> 20:09.956
He came to town looking for his father
after a long separation,

20:10.085 --> 20:11.916
and he recently found him.

20:12.295 --> 20:13.375
Ah!

20:14.130 --> 20:17.463
And a happy reunion
has already taken place?

20:17.592 --> 20:20.083
No. He hasn't spoken to him yet.

20:21.054 --> 20:22.089
And why not?

20:22.680 --> 20:25.717
Mmm. It was a difficult parting.

20:26.059 --> 20:28.425
There are many issues
to be resolved between them.

20:30.772 --> 20:31.932
I see.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.282
Reul Ghorm,

20:54.129 --> 20:55.665
are you there?

20:57.841 --> 20:59.581
If you can help me,

20:59.968 --> 21:02.334
please make yourself known to me.

21:22.365 --> 21:23.605
Can you help me?

21:23.700 --> 21:24.735
I can help.

21:24.868 --> 21:26.699
How do I know I can trust you?

21:26.870 --> 21:29.407
Because there is good magic
and dark magic.

21:29.539 --> 21:31.404
And I'm on the right side.

21:31.541 --> 21:33.247
You're a fairy!

21:33.376 --> 21:34.741
(CHUCKLES)

21:34.961 --> 21:36.121
Oh!

21:36.212 --> 21:39.420
And you're not untouched
by magic, are you, child?

21:39.549 --> 21:41.085
There is something dark in your life.

21:41.718 --> 21:43.049
My father.

21:44.095 --> 21:46.051
He is the Dark One.

21:46.514 --> 21:48.505
Oh! I can't make him
the man he was before.

21:48.600 --> 21:51.387
But I can send him some place where
he won't be able to use his powers.

21:51.561 --> 21:53.097
Not ajail.

21:53.188 --> 21:55.975
I want to be with him. Like it used to be.

21:56.065 --> 21:59.273
Not a jail, young one.
Just a place without magic.

21:59.402 --> 22:00.482
But magic is everywhere.

22:00.570 --> 22:01.935
In this world, yes.

22:02.071 --> 22:05.529
You see, what ails your father
is specific to our realm.

22:05.617 --> 22:07.903
His powers do not belong here.

22:08.912 --> 22:11.619
You must go where you can escape
this wretched curse.

22:11.748 --> 22:13.363
Go? We have to leave?

22:13.458 --> 22:15.449
Yes. It is the only way.

22:15.585 --> 22:17.541
Can you do it?

22:17.629 --> 22:19.790
Can you leave everything here behind
for the unknown?

22:19.923 --> 22:23.757
If it means I get my father back,
then yes.

22:24.052 --> 22:25.963
You're a very good son, Baelfire.

22:26.095 --> 22:28.757
You are the part of him
that keeps him human.

22:28.890 --> 22:31.632
That little light inside of him
that still glows,

22:31.935 --> 22:34.096
that's his love for you.

22:34.479 --> 22:36.640
Hold out your hand.

22:46.449 --> 22:47.438
What is it?

22:47.534 --> 22:49.274
A magic bean.

22:49.452 --> 22:52.285
The very last one
that is known to our kind.

22:52.705 --> 22:54.957
The others got away from us.

22:55.124 --> 22:57.206
You just use it wisely.

22:57.335 --> 22:59.826
You follow wherever it leads you.

22:59.963 --> 23:01.794
It will save you both.

23:20.650 --> 23:22.140
Mary Margaret.

23:23.987 --> 23:25.818
Please wait.

23:25.947 --> 23:28.279
Look, I'll leave if you want.

23:28.366 --> 23:30.357
I just think we need to talk.

23:30.493 --> 23:31.699
So talk.

23:32.161 --> 23:33.241
I need to apologize.

23:33.329 --> 23:35.706
Yes, you do. Keep going.

23:37.166 --> 23:40.158
I didn't believe you.
I didn't stand with you.

23:43.339 --> 23:46.172
You know, Iwill never
forget that moment.

23:47.552 --> 23:49.918
The moment the world
sort of blows you backwards

23:50.680 --> 23:54.764
and the one person you thought
would always be there to catch you,

23:55.727 --> 23:56.933
he isn't there.

23:57.270 --> 23:59.101
Look at what was going on.

23:59.188 --> 24:00.803
It was yourjewelry box,

24:00.898 --> 24:03.389
your fingerprints,
knife in your apartment.

24:03.484 --> 24:04.769
It was a setup.

24:04.861 --> 24:06.476
And a really good one.

24:08.573 --> 24:10.154
I'm human.

24:10.241 --> 24:11.481
I fell for it.

24:13.119 --> 24:15.451
I'm sorry, but we have to move forward.

24:15.580 --> 24:16.990
But we can't.

24:18.708 --> 24:22.371
It's like something in this world
doesn't want us together.

24:22.462 --> 24:24.293
Like what? Dark forces?

24:24.380 --> 24:25.961
Maybe.

24:26.090 --> 24:27.296
I don't know.

24:27.383 --> 24:32.377
But it's like something just keeps
pouring poison between us,

24:33.556 --> 24:37.890
and what I don't want is to have
all of those good memories

24:39.520 --> 24:41.806
replaced by moments like that.

24:42.357 --> 24:44.222
When I looked at you,

24:44.567 --> 24:47.183
and I saw that you didn't believe me.

24:47.278 --> 24:48.484
No, I know.

24:49.739 --> 24:52.071
I'm so sorry.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.568
I know.

24:54.869 --> 24:56.075
(SIGHS)

24:56.579 --> 24:57.785
I know.

24:58.748 --> 25:00.488
But I love you.

25:02.669 --> 25:07.629
And that is what makes it all so sad.

25:25.775 --> 25:27.606
Papa!

25:29.654 --> 25:31.519
Papa!

25:32.448 --> 25:33.608
I found it.

25:33.700 --> 25:36.066
I found a way for things
to be like they were.

25:38.037 --> 25:39.413
I want you to come with me.

25:39.497 --> 25:41.408
I can make things right.

25:42.166 --> 25:43.872
Have you heard of the Reul Ghorm?

25:48.047 --> 25:49.583
Blue Star.

25:51.384 --> 25:52.794
The Blue Fairy.

25:53.302 --> 25:55.463
Oh! Son, please tell me you didn't.

25:55.596 --> 25:58.929
Fairy magic doesn't mix well
with what I am.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.047
But you promised.

26:00.560 --> 26:01.720
She can help us.

26:01.811 --> 26:03.301
To take us to a place without magic.

26:03.396 --> 26:05.227
A place without magic?

26:06.315 --> 26:07.600
(SCOFFS)

26:07.942 --> 26:09.648
I'd be powerless.

26:09.736 --> 26:10.896
Weak.

26:10.987 --> 26:13.569
Like everyone else. It wouldn't matter.

26:13.656 --> 26:14.645
We'd be happy.

26:14.782 --> 26:15.988
We can be happy here.

26:16.117 --> 26:19.325
Father, please. You're getting worse.

26:19.454 --> 26:20.739
And you promised.

26:20.830 --> 26:23.321
This can work. It can.

26:25.418 --> 26:27.454
You made a deal with me.

26:28.337 --> 26:29.838
Are you backing out?

26:38.973 --> 26:40.088
No.

26:50.151 --> 26:53.109
Mr. Gold. Are you here for the rent?

26:53.446 --> 26:55.311
Why does everyone ask that?

26:55.448 --> 26:57.939
Well, because you... Never mind.

26:58.034 --> 26:59.865
Would you...

26:59.952 --> 27:01.453
Would you like to talk?

27:02.163 --> 27:03.369
I don't know.

27:03.790 --> 27:08.284
Well, if you'd like to get something
off your chest,

27:09.295 --> 27:10.535
please come in.

27:16.344 --> 27:17.880
A son!

27:18.679 --> 27:22.171
Wow, I didn't know you had a son.
How old is he?

27:23.142 --> 27:25.133
Let's start with something easier.

27:25.228 --> 27:26.718
Okay.

27:26.813 --> 27:29.725
What do you mean to say
that you may have found him?

27:30.691 --> 27:33.819
Let's just say there's someone acting
the way I would expect him to act.

27:33.903 --> 27:35.894
So you recognize him?

27:35.988 --> 27:37.068
Maybe.

27:37.156 --> 27:40.319
Or perhaps I'm just seeing
what I want to see. I don't know.

27:40.493 --> 27:43.656
Okay. Well, I mean,
wouldn't he recognize you?

27:43.746 --> 27:45.532
There was conflict.

27:46.916 --> 27:49.328
I'm not sure he's ready
for a tear-soaked reunion.

27:49.418 --> 27:52.000
So he sought you out
and he's hanging back.

27:52.088 --> 27:53.749
Maybe he's watching
to see if he's welcome,

27:53.840 --> 27:55.580
looking for a sign that all is forgiven.

27:55.758 --> 27:58.750
No, no, no, he's not the one
who needs to be...

28:01.055 --> 28:03.671
I think he might still be very angry.

28:07.895 --> 28:12.389
Anger between a parent and a child
is the most natural thing in the world.

28:12.608 --> 28:14.599
I think he might be here to try to kill me.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.480
Ah!

28:17.572 --> 28:19.904
Right. That's not...

28:21.284 --> 28:23.195
I let him go.

28:25.955 --> 28:29.698
I've spent my entire life since
trying to fix it.

28:29.792 --> 28:31.953
And now he's finally here...

28:32.962 --> 28:35.123
I just don't know what to do.

28:37.466 --> 28:38.751
Be honest.

28:39.969 --> 28:44.053
Just tell him what you told me,
and ask him for forgiveness.

28:44.140 --> 28:45.596
And when you're face to face,
you'll know what to do.

28:45.683 --> 28:47.719
Honesty's never been
the best color on me.

28:47.810 --> 28:50.096
But there's no other way.

29:16.631 --> 29:18.792
I know who you are.

29:22.970 --> 29:25.006
And I know what you're looking for.

29:25.139 --> 29:28.552
Well, then,
I guess all the lying can stop,

29:31.354 --> 29:32.469
Papa.

29:40.863 --> 29:42.774
RUMPLESTILTSKIN:
Where are we going, boy?

29:42.865 --> 29:44.947
What kind of world is this
we're going to?

29:45.034 --> 29:47.650
What kind of world is without magic?

29:49.497 --> 29:50.703
A better one.

30:03.928 --> 30:05.293
(RUMBLING)

30:09.767 --> 30:11.883
My gods, boy. It's like a tornado!

30:12.019 --> 30:13.008
We have to go through it.

30:13.104 --> 30:14.344
No, no! I don't think I can!

30:14.438 --> 30:16.053
We must. It's the only way.

30:18.359 --> 30:21.271
No, no, no, no, no! It's a trick!
It will tear us apart!

30:21.404 --> 30:24.066
It's not. It will be okay. I promise.

30:25.074 --> 30:26.530
Papa!

30:30.371 --> 30:31.986
We have to go through!

30:32.081 --> 30:33.116
What are you doing?

30:33.582 --> 30:35.914
Papa, it won't stay open long! Let's go!

30:36.085 --> 30:37.871
I can't! I can't!

30:37.962 --> 30:41.125
Papa, please!
It's the only way we can be together!

30:41.257 --> 30:42.542
No, Bae, I can't!

30:42.633 --> 30:44.248
Papa, please!

30:44.385 --> 30:45.625
I can't!

30:45.720 --> 30:49.588
You coward! You promised!
Don't break our deal!

30:49.724 --> 30:50.713
I have to!

30:52.768 --> 30:53.928
Papa!

30:54.103 --> 30:55.092
(SCREAMING)

31:00.443 --> 31:01.603
(PANTING)

31:12.496 --> 31:13.611
Bae!

31:15.249 --> 31:16.409
Bae!

31:18.586 --> 31:21.328
No, no, no, no, no! No, no, Bae!

31:21.464 --> 31:22.829
I'm sorry, Bae!

31:22.965 --> 31:24.671
I want to come with you!

31:24.800 --> 31:28.418
I want to come with you, Bae!
I want to come with you!

31:28.512 --> 31:32.471
BaelBaelBae!

31:34.143 --> 31:35.929
You were right, Bae.

31:37.480 --> 31:39.311
You were always right.

31:42.526 --> 31:46.610
I was a coward
and I never should have let you go.

31:48.866 --> 31:51.323
I know it's little consolation,

31:52.495 --> 31:55.987
but ljust want you to know
that ever since you left,

31:56.123 --> 31:59.661
ever since you crossed the barriers
of time and space,

31:59.794 --> 32:02.536
in every waking moment,

32:05.174 --> 32:07.005
I've been looking for you.

32:09.470 --> 32:12.177
And now that I have finally found you...

32:13.390 --> 32:16.553
I know I can't make up for the past,

32:16.685 --> 32:18.721
for the lost time.

32:20.564 --> 32:25.433
All I can do is to ask you to do
what you've always done

32:25.528 --> 32:27.894
and that's to be the bigger man,

32:30.616 --> 32:31.947
and forgive me.

32:33.035 --> 32:34.866
I'm so sorry, son.

32:36.038 --> 32:37.027
(SIGHS)

32:37.748 --> 32:39.864
I'm so sorry, Bae.

32:45.214 --> 32:47.045
(SOBBING) My boy.

32:48.551 --> 32:50.633
My beautiful boy!

32:53.389 --> 32:56.222
Can you truly, truly forgive me?

32:57.226 --> 32:58.932
I forgive you, Papa.

33:10.823 --> 33:13.155
You were looking for the knife.

33:14.743 --> 33:17.405
I thought that if you still had it,

33:17.496 --> 33:19.828
it would mean that you hadn't changed.

33:22.668 --> 33:25.580
Well, let's go and find it and see.

33:27.923 --> 33:31.290
I buried it here shortly after
Emma came to town.

33:32.011 --> 33:33.171
Things were changing.

33:33.262 --> 33:35.799
Didn't want to take the chance
of Regina finding it.

33:36.599 --> 33:37.930
Of course.

33:38.851 --> 33:40.182
It should be right about here some...

33:40.603 --> 33:41.592
Here, look, look.

33:44.857 --> 33:45.937
Here.

33:58.996 --> 34:00.452
I want you to take it.

34:02.291 --> 34:05.624
Destroy it the way I know
you always wanted to.

34:08.714 --> 34:09.954
I found you

34:10.049 --> 34:11.960
and I don't need it anymore.

34:13.636 --> 34:15.172
I chose it once.

34:16.847 --> 34:18.462
Now I choose you.

34:30.819 --> 34:32.025
It's remarkable.

34:42.998 --> 34:45.410
By the power of the darkness,

34:46.043 --> 34:50.707
I command thee, Dark One.

34:52.174 --> 34:54.256
You're trying to control me?

34:55.177 --> 34:58.010
I command thee, Dark One!

35:00.516 --> 35:02.427
You are not my son.

35:09.733 --> 35:11.473
You're not Baelfire.

35:11.568 --> 35:13.479
Papa, why would you say that?

35:13.570 --> 35:14.980
I'm just trying to use
your power to help...

35:15.072 --> 35:16.403
Enough!

35:16.490 --> 35:19.027
It's over, Booth. Or whoever you are.

35:19.118 --> 35:22.110
My son would never try to use me.

35:22.621 --> 35:27.456
And he would know that this knife
cannot harness any magic in this world

35:27.543 --> 35:30.376
because there is no magic in this world.

35:31.171 --> 35:33.457
That's why he chose this place.

35:34.300 --> 35:37.633
-He didn't want me dabbling.
-(GRUNTS)

35:41.974 --> 35:44.135
So why bury a useless knife?

35:44.226 --> 35:46.308
Oh! I wouldn't say it was useless.

35:46.395 --> 35:49.353
Still cuts through flesh rather nicely.

35:51.191 --> 35:54.058
It's about time you started
answering some questions, sunshine.

35:54.194 --> 35:57.527
Why the theatrics?
Why didn't you just come to me?

35:58.490 --> 36:01.027
I needed you to work for it.

36:01.910 --> 36:03.320
I needed you to want it so bad

36:03.412 --> 36:05.994
you would ignore
what your eyes were seeing.

36:06.081 --> 36:08.163
Do I even look like him at all?

36:08.667 --> 36:10.908
How do you know about this knife?

36:11.045 --> 36:12.080
I hear things.

36:12.171 --> 36:14.662
No one here knows about this knife.

36:14.757 --> 36:17.339
No one here remembers.

36:18.093 --> 36:20.004
And yet you do.

36:20.095 --> 36:22.051
You're from there, aren't you?

36:22.848 --> 36:24.008
From my world?

36:24.099 --> 36:27.432
The fact that you're asking the question
means you know the answer.

36:29.688 --> 36:32.225
Well, now that that's settled...

36:36.111 --> 36:38.602
How about my other question?

36:38.697 --> 36:41.689
Who told you about me and the knife?

36:42.284 --> 36:43.865
A little fairy.

36:44.036 --> 36:45.776
Why did you want it?

36:46.789 --> 36:50.782
If you know who I am,
then you know who I am.

36:51.251 --> 36:56.211
The chances of you surviving
this little encounter are pretty slim.

36:56.924 --> 36:58.960
So why take the risk?

37:00.552 --> 37:02.929
Because I'll die anyway.

37:03.972 --> 37:05.098
What?

37:06.225 --> 37:07.715
I'm sick.

37:08.477 --> 37:11.139
I'm sick and I need magic.

37:11.772 --> 37:14.605
I was gonna get the savior to believe,

37:14.691 --> 37:16.773
but that woman... (LAUGHS)

37:17.569 --> 37:20.231
I don't think I'm gonna make it
long enough to see that happen.

37:25.285 --> 37:26.866
She trusts you.

37:26.954 --> 37:29.115
It might be enough.

37:32.042 --> 37:33.578
Try again.

37:38.215 --> 37:39.546
You're gonna let me live?

37:39.758 --> 37:41.623
You're gonna die either way.

37:41.718 --> 37:45.506
This way,
at least I might get something out of it.

37:59.069 --> 38:02.527
Reul Ghorm! Show yourself!

38:12.875 --> 38:14.240
How do I follow him?

38:14.334 --> 38:18.418
You had the way. You didn't take it.
And there are no more magic beans.

38:18.505 --> 38:19.711
That's a lie.

38:19.798 --> 38:20.787
We don't do that.

38:20.883 --> 38:22.123
A lie.

38:22.217 --> 38:24.003
You will never make it to that world.

38:24.094 --> 38:25.425
Well, I'll find a way.

38:25.512 --> 38:27.468
There must be other paths.

38:27.556 --> 38:28.762
-A realm-jumper?
-No.

38:28.849 --> 38:29.929
-A time-turner?
-No.

38:30.017 --> 38:31.132
A mage?

38:31.226 --> 38:33.558
-There is no...
-A curse?

38:33.645 --> 38:35.351
-(HESITANTLY) No.
-Ah!

38:35.439 --> 38:37.100
So it is a curse.

38:37.191 --> 38:39.807
Of course you would think of a curse
instead of a blessing.

38:39.902 --> 38:43.190
Your magic is limited by its own
rotten core, Rumplestiltskin.

38:43.280 --> 38:46.818
Anyway, it can't be done.
Not without a great price.

38:46.950 --> 38:48.861
I've already paid a great price.

38:48.952 --> 38:51.238
So you'd be willing to sacrifice
this world for the next?

38:51.330 --> 38:53.867
Because that's how great the price is.

38:53.957 --> 38:55.538
Well, what do you think?

38:55.626 --> 38:56.991
Well, then I'll comfort myself

38:57.085 --> 38:58.916
knowing that such a curse
is beyond your abilities.

38:59.004 --> 39:00.039
Oh! For now.

39:00.130 --> 39:03.122
But I have got all the time in the world.

39:03.884 --> 39:06.000
I will do nothing else.

39:06.094 --> 39:08.506
I will love nothing else!

39:08.972 --> 39:10.837
Iwill find a way.

39:10.933 --> 39:12.798
You took my son.

39:12.893 --> 39:14.884
But I will get him back.

39:14.978 --> 39:16.479
I didn't take your son.

39:16.605 --> 39:19.142
You took my son!
But I will get him back!

39:19.274 --> 39:21.526
You drove him away.

39:23.862 --> 39:24.851
(GASPS)

39:28.617 --> 39:30.107
|Wi|| find him!

39:30.202 --> 39:32.284
|Wi|| find him!

39:33.622 --> 39:35.453
|Wi|| find him.

39:45.717 --> 39:47.503
Congratulations, Sheriff Swan.

39:48.095 --> 39:51.007
There is about to be
a big break in your case.

39:51.098 --> 39:53.259
You just got yourself a confession.

39:54.226 --> 39:56.433
But I want you to listen
to the whole explanation,

39:56.520 --> 39:57.851
so you understand why this happened.

39:57.938 --> 39:59.144
I'll hang on every word you say.

39:59.231 --> 40:01.347
Sidney, you can come in now.

40:07.364 --> 40:08.979
Tell her what you told me.

40:10.409 --> 40:12.821
It was me. I confess.

40:14.037 --> 40:15.288
I abducted Kathryn

40:15.372 --> 40:18.205
and I held her in the basement of an
abandoned summer home by the lake.

40:18.667 --> 40:20.999
I bribed a lab tech to get me
the heart from the hospital

40:21.086 --> 40:23.168
and I used that same person
to doctor the lab results.

40:24.089 --> 40:25.670
And the other thing.

40:26.675 --> 40:29.417
I borrowed some skeleton keys
from Regina

40:29.511 --> 40:32.674
and I planted the knife
in your apartment.

40:33.390 --> 40:34.505
REGINA: My keys.

40:34.641 --> 40:36.927
I can't help but feel
personally violated about that part.

40:37.019 --> 40:39.010
And I am supposed to believe
you did this for why now?

40:39.146 --> 40:41.512
I was gonna find her
after the conviction, be a hero,

40:42.482 --> 40:46.020
then get the inside track on the
biggest story to ever hit this town.

40:46.153 --> 40:50.066
I'd get myjob back,
plus a novel and a movie and...

40:50.198 --> 40:52.189
I don't know. It sounds crazy now.

40:52.701 --> 40:56.819
I don't know about crazy.
But false, yes. False as hell.

40:56.913 --> 40:59.120
I have maps to where the house is.

40:59.207 --> 41:00.413
You'll find chains in the basement.

41:00.542 --> 41:02.828
Lots of fingerprints, I'm sure,
hers and mine.

41:02.919 --> 41:04.375
But I didn't hurt her.

41:07.132 --> 41:09.874
The man has obviously suffered
some kind of mental break.

41:10.302 --> 41:13.089
He clearly hasn't been himself
for a while.

41:13.221 --> 41:16.213
Yeah. It's like his words aren't his at all.

41:16.308 --> 41:19.015
Wow. You are so sold
on your own rush to judgment

41:19.102 --> 41:20.717
that you can't even see
the truth anymore.

41:21.772 --> 41:23.387
A word in the hallway, please.

41:26.234 --> 41:27.223
(CLICKS TONGUE)

41:35.410 --> 41:37.150
Well, that's the biggest load of crap
I've ever heard.

41:37.329 --> 41:39.445
I'm pretty sure that's not true.

41:40.123 --> 41:41.624
That poor man.

41:41.750 --> 41:43.160
I know you were behind all of this.

41:43.251 --> 41:44.912
I understand that you own the game

41:45.003 --> 41:47.415
and that you've set the board
so that no one else can win,

41:47.923 --> 41:50.665
but I am about to start playing
an entirely different game.

41:52.260 --> 41:54.342
I don't care about what happens to you.

41:54.429 --> 41:56.590
I don't care about what happens to me.

41:56.682 --> 41:59.719
All I care about is what happens
to my kid.

42:01.895 --> 42:04.102
And you are going to leave him alone.

42:05.357 --> 42:06.346
Am I?

42:06.441 --> 42:07.772
Uh-uh. I'm talking.

42:07.859 --> 42:09.599
You are a sociopath, lady.

42:10.278 --> 42:12.690
You tried to take away
someone that I love

42:13.865 --> 42:18.279
and now I'm gonna take away
someone you love.

42:20.789 --> 42:23.121
I'm taking back my son.
