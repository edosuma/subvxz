13:26.170 --> 13:27.140
Could you hold this for me?

13:27.340 --> 13:29.140
- We started out
with one robotics lab.

13:29.340 --> 13:32.710
Now we have three because
the class is so popular.

13:32.910 --> 13:35.410
It's everyone's
favorite elective.

13:35.610 --> 13:37.350
My kids took it last year.

13:37.550 --> 13:38.510
It's also an easy A.

13:38.710 --> 13:40.780
Harlan got a D.

13:40.980 --> 13:42.320
Well, personally,

13:42.520 --> 13:44.720
I, you know, was hoping
they'd use these to print food,

13:44.920 --> 13:46.690
you know,
like little candies and such.

13:46.890 --> 13:49.120
Robots freak me out.

13:55.360 --> 13:58.370
- That's how you knew
that the arsonist was student.

13:59.230 --> 14:02.770
The incendiary device
was made with these parts.

14:02.970 --> 14:05.640
- I could tell they were
fabricated from a 3D printer.

14:05.840 --> 14:06.940
And then when you look closely,

14:07.140 --> 14:09.240
you can see
that each one has a school ID.

14:09.440 --> 14:10.580
Gray Lakes High School.

14:10.780 --> 14:13.250
[school bell rings]

14:13.450 --> 14:14.820
- Seems like the arsonist
would know that too

14:15.020 --> 14:16.020
if he took this class.

14:16.220 --> 14:18.620
- Oh, he knew,
and probably didn't care.

14:18.820 --> 14:21.890
[indistinct chatter]

14:29.000 --> 14:30.170
Jang, remind me.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.670
Which of these kids said
the construction site

14:32.870 --> 14:34.440
was a good place
to watch the fire?

14:34.640 --> 14:37.340
Oh, that one.

14:37.540 --> 14:40.210
Cyrus Nix.

14:46.780 --> 14:47.920
- They took him
for questioning.

14:48.120 --> 14:49.480
Did you know
his dad was a firefighter?

14:49.680 --> 14:50.920
His dad died in a fire.

14:51.120 --> 14:52.290
- Do they really think
Cyrus is the arsonist?

14:52.490 --> 14:54.220
I mean, he seems so nice.

14:54.420 --> 14:55.930
- Everyone seems nice to you,
Luna.

14:56.120 --> 14:58.630
Everett,
what are we doing here?

14:58.830 --> 15:00.060
Show them.

15:00.260 --> 15:01.400
[sighs]

15:03.100 --> 15:04.630
- What, are we supposed
to go there now?

15:04.830 --> 15:05.770
No thanks.

15:05.970 --> 15:07.970
I am not watching
someone die again.

15:08.170 --> 15:09.500
- I think
it's meant for tonight.

15:09.700 --> 15:10.840
How do you know?

15:11.040 --> 15:12.710
- Because this pin drop
is Tia Patterson's house

15:12.910 --> 15:14.210
and she's still here at school.

15:14.410 --> 15:15.780
- I heard
someone's having people over.

15:15.980 --> 15:17.150
Maybe it's Tia.

15:17.350 --> 15:19.350
- Like a party?
- No, like a kickback.

15:19.550 --> 15:21.050
Couple friends
chilling by the pool.

15:21.250 --> 15:23.390
- They're not gonna let us in,
especially me.

15:23.580 --> 15:24.790
Well, if it's Tia,

15:24.990 --> 15:26.490
I know something
that can get us in.

15:26.690 --> 15:27.520
What?

15:27.720 --> 15:29.460
I got it. Trust me.

15:29.660 --> 15:32.760
Unlike some people,
my hearing works all the time.

15:33.760 --> 15:35.030
What's that supposed to mean?

15:35.230 --> 15:36.230
- Maybe you should go
to the gym

15:36.430 --> 15:38.870
and work
on that super strength,

15:39.070 --> 15:40.570
'cause I didn't see shit
from you last night.

15:40.770 --> 15:42.570
Harlan, they're learning.

15:42.770 --> 15:44.270
They need to learn faster.

15:44.470 --> 15:46.110
Where are you going?

15:46.310 --> 15:47.510
Shopping.

15:54.180 --> 15:56.520
- You have any idea
why she wanted me here?

15:56.720 --> 16:00.560
I don't really feel like
I'm adding much value.

16:00.760 --> 16:02.420
- I agree.
You add nothing.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.960
[chuckles]

16:06.160 --> 16:07.130
We're gonna be good friends.

16:07.330 --> 16:09.030
I can tell.
[door opens]

16:09.230 --> 16:11.530
- Sorry to keep you so late
after school, Cyrus,

16:11.730 --> 16:14.400
but we just have some important
questions to follow up on.

16:14.600 --> 16:16.410
Do you need
to call your parents?

16:16.600 --> 16:19.240
No. And it's just my mom.

16:19.440 --> 16:21.280
- You never knew your father,
did you?

16:26.510 --> 16:29.080
I realize this is
a difficult subject for you,

16:29.280 --> 16:30.620
but I'd like you
to tell me what you know

16:30.820 --> 16:32.150
about your father's death.

16:33.890 --> 16:37.090
- He died fighting a wildfire
right after I was born.

16:37.290 --> 16:38.930
About 17 years ago.

16:40.560 --> 16:43.530
- Another fire very much like
the one going on right now.

16:45.400 --> 16:49.740
There were other firefighters
who died alongside your father.

16:49.940 --> 16:52.670
His friends.

16:52.870 --> 16:54.840
I'm asking you
about your father

16:55.040 --> 16:57.950
because I'm finding some...

16:58.150 --> 17:01.050
interesting connections
between the two fires

17:01.250 --> 17:04.690
despite the fact that
they're almost 20 years apart.

17:04.890 --> 17:06.350
You mean me.

17:08.020 --> 17:09.790

between the two fires.

the other day.

I was listening to my parents,

21:06.430 --> 21:08.060
Did you hear anything?

21:08.260 --> 21:11.700
- Well, I heard my mom say
she hates me.

21:11.900 --> 21:12.930
Brutal.

How did you learn it, anyway?

21:14.440 --> 21:16.270

how did you get good at it?

21:18.210 --> 21:22.510
I was, like, 12
and in the woods.

21:22.710 --> 21:24.080
It was actually
the one and only time

21:24.280 --> 21:25.210
I saw my real dad.

21:25.410 --> 21:26.850
What did he look like?

21:27.050 --> 21:28.550
Like a wolf, dumbass.

21:28.750 --> 21:31.220
- [chuckles] But not like--
he's not 7 feet tall?

21:31.420 --> 21:33.590
No, like a wolf.

21:33.790 --> 21:36.420
A regular,
ordinary-looking wolf.

21:38.160 --> 21:39.390
So how'd you know it was him?

21:39.590 --> 21:41.660
It's hard to explain.

21:41.860 --> 21:45.700
I guess I kind of
just felt a connection.

<i>that we were related.</i>

21:52.570 --> 21:56.210
from a regular wolf
to a 7-foot-tall werewolf?

21:57.140 --> 21:59.510
I don't know.

21:59.710 --> 22:00.520
- You know,
maybe it has something

22:00.720 --> 22:01.950
to do with the story of Lycaon.

22:02.150 --> 22:04.550
- I'm pretty sure that
Zeus didn't come down here

22:04.750 --> 22:06.290
to turn my real dad
into a werewolf.

22:06.490 --> 22:09.720
- I know,
but doesn't it make you wonder?

22:09.920 --> 22:12.890
If there's a way to change him
from a regular wolf

22:13.090 --> 22:15.430
to a monster...

22:17.230 --> 22:19.630
Maybe there's a way
to change him back.

22:21.770 --> 22:22.940
Back to a wolf.

22:26.110 --> 22:27.680
Or maybe even...

22:27.880 --> 22:29.680
Back to a human.

23:56.800 --> 23:58.570
Fuck yes!

24:00.330 --> 24:03.070
- Tia, this was supposed
to be a mellow kickback.

24:03.270 --> 24:06.110
Well, now it's a party.

24:07.640 --> 24:09.180

24:11.250 --> 24:12.480

24:12.680 --> 24:14.020

24:14.210 --> 24:15.580

24:17.120 --> 24:19.250

24:25.290 --> 24:26.090

24:26.290 --> 24:27.930
Already buzzed and stoned.

24:41.910 --> 24:43.450
Shrooms?

24:43.640 --> 24:45.280
- Austin?
- Shit.

24:45.480 --> 24:46.410
There we go.

24:46.610 --> 24:48.220
Nice.

24:53.690 --> 24:55.160
What, are you judging me?

24:55.360 --> 24:57.690
- No, I've taken
mushrooms before.

24:57.890 --> 24:58.860
Really?

24:59.060 --> 25:00.430
Yeah, more than once.

25:00.630 --> 25:04.200
- But, like, in Joshua Tree
with your bestie, right?

25:04.400 --> 25:07.170
In some kind of
perfect nature vibe

25:07.370 --> 25:10.840
where you brought coloring
books and organic fruit

25:11.040 --> 25:12.540
and your cool,
little bohemian journal

25:12.740 --> 25:15.380
so you'd write poems
about your spirituality?

25:17.410 --> 25:19.550
- Oh, shit.
Did I get a lot of that right?

25:19.750 --> 25:21.520
No.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.480
You're just an asshole.

25:31.190 --> 25:34.330
- You probably shouldn't
look at him like that.

25:34.530 --> 25:36.160
Like what?

25:36.360 --> 25:38.370
Like you wanna kill him.

25:40.840 --> 25:42.700

26:14.400 --> 26:16.240
- We aren't gonna take any,
are we?

26:17.840 --> 26:19.540
Or we're gonna just take one?

26:22.680 --> 26:23.980
This one's my second.

26:27.280 --> 26:28.780
- How are we supposed
to save someone's life

26:28.980 --> 26:29.880
if we're all high?

26:30.080 --> 26:31.250
- Oh, one's barely
gonna affect me.

26:31.450 --> 26:33.990
It's practically a microdose.

26:34.190 --> 26:35.390
Maybe you should take one.

26:35.590 --> 26:36.960
It'll help you
with your anxiety.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.430
Depression, actually.

26:38.630 --> 26:42.360
I mean, I've taken them before
in a clinical setting.

26:42.560 --> 26:45.130
- You did shrooms
in a doctor's office?

26:45.330 --> 26:47.400
Yeah, psilocybin acts

26:47.600 --> 26:49.970
on the serotonin
5-HT2A receptors--

26:50.170 --> 26:52.740
- Okay, don't ruin shrooms
for me, dude.

26:52.940 --> 26:54.240
Just take one.

26:54.440 --> 26:57.080
- He doesn't have to
if he doesn't want to.

27:01.880 --> 27:03.250
Have fun.

27:12.030 --> 27:15.100
<i>[police radio chatter]</i>

27:20.130 --> 27:21.100
The guard's already here.

27:21.300 --> 27:22.700
He can let us in to any level.

27:22.900 --> 27:24.740
Follow me.

27:24.940 --> 27:27.340
The developer stopped building
about three years ago

27:27.540 --> 27:28.780
when they ran out of money.

27:28.980 --> 27:31.510
Now it's just another strain
on the environment.

27:31.710 --> 27:34.420
- You would know something
about that.

27:34.610 --> 27:35.920
Excuse me?

27:36.120 --> 27:37.290
- You used
to have some affiliation

27:37.480 --> 27:39.690
with a few radical
environmental groups,

27:39.890 --> 27:41.360
if I'm not mistaken.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.390
- That was back in my 20s
after college,

27:43.590 --> 27:45.960
and I wouldn't
call them radical.

27:46.160 --> 27:47.730
And never convicted of arson.

27:50.060 --> 27:52.930
<i>[tense music]</i>

27:53.130 --> 28:00.210
<i>* *</i>

28:01.840 --> 28:03.680
No security cameras.

28:03.880 --> 28:05.850
We can't tell how many times
those kids came up here.

28:06.050 --> 28:09.980
- But we know Cyrus was the one
that brought them here.

28:10.180 --> 28:11.650
I didn't mean
to sound so accusatory

28:11.850 --> 28:12.990
with Prisha, by the way.

28:13.190 --> 28:15.060
I know you two were close.

28:16.060 --> 28:17.430
Mostly out of habit.

28:17.620 --> 28:20.390
- But you do want
to know something, don't you?

28:20.590 --> 28:21.760
I do.

28:21.960 --> 28:24.630
How I found Harlan and Luna.

28:24.830 --> 28:26.430
That's the first part.

28:26.630 --> 28:28.970
- And why I found them
during the same wildfire

28:29.170 --> 28:30.610
in which Cyrus' father died.

28:30.800 --> 28:32.740
- You're practically
doing my job for me.

28:32.940 --> 28:35.410
- I can't tell you
about Cyrus' father,

28:35.610 --> 28:39.450
but Harlan and Luna were
abandoned in the woods.

28:39.650 --> 28:41.850
No note or any sign
of the parents.

28:42.050 --> 28:44.620
Social Services
was overwhelmed at the time,

28:44.820 --> 28:48.460
so I offered to foster them
until there was room.

28:48.660 --> 28:50.990
Two months later,
they came back.

28:51.190 --> 28:53.290
Said they found a family,

28:53.490 --> 28:55.730
someone that could
potentially adopt.

28:55.930 --> 28:58.370
I told them
someone already wanted to.

28:58.570 --> 28:59.630
You.

28:59.830 --> 29:00.970
Me.

29:01.170 --> 29:03.640
Almost like a fairy tale.

29:03.840 --> 29:05.510
Surprised?

29:05.710 --> 29:07.280
Curious.

29:07.470 --> 29:10.650
What made you want
to take on that responsibility?

29:10.840 --> 29:14.350
- I ask that question
every time I fight with Harlan.

29:15.850 --> 29:17.690
Same problem with my son.

29:17.890 --> 29:21.090
After a certain age,
all we ever did was fight.

29:21.290 --> 29:23.360
What changed?

29:26.930 --> 29:29.460
He died in a fire.

29:44.310 --> 29:46.780
- Oh, hell no.
You're not wearing that.

29:46.980 --> 29:48.920
Here.
I brought extras just in case.

29:49.120 --> 29:50.380
In case of what?

29:50.580 --> 29:52.720
- In case you decided
to wear something like that.

29:53.960 --> 29:55.560
- I don't need
to wear a slutty bikini

29:55.760 --> 29:57.760
so a bunch of hormonal boys
can stare at me.

29:57.960 --> 29:58.960
It's not slutty.

29:59.160 --> 30:00.930
And it's not for them.
It's for you.

30:01.930 --> 30:03.430
So I can stare at myself?

30:03.630 --> 30:05.270
No.

30:05.470 --> 30:06.900
So you can see yourself.

30:12.540 --> 30:14.440

31:41.330 --> 31:44.270
- This is
what I wanted to show you.

31:44.460 --> 31:47.570
That out there is
your area of expertise,

31:47.770 --> 31:48.770
not mine.

31:48.970 --> 31:51.810
Satellite photo,
beginning of the fires.

31:52.010 --> 31:53.670
About an hour
after they were started.

31:53.870 --> 31:56.380
These are the origin points.

31:56.580 --> 31:58.610
- My theory is the arsonist
set the fire in the woods

31:58.810 --> 32:02.350
and then came back here
to watch them both burn.

32:04.590 --> 32:07.660
But the burn rate's the same.

32:07.850 --> 32:09.690
Both fires started
at the same time.

32:09.890 --> 32:12.330
- Then one was
probably set remotely,

32:12.530 --> 32:14.260
by radio or cell phone.

32:14.460 --> 32:16.930
- And then
the arsonist came here?

32:17.130 --> 32:18.270
That's what I'm thinking.

32:18.470 --> 32:20.600
No.

32:20.800 --> 32:23.200
The arsonist didn't just
watch the fire from this ledge.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.670
He set it from here,
both fires.

32:25.870 --> 32:28.780
Both incendiary devices
set off at the same time.

32:28.980 --> 32:30.040
From here?

32:30.240 --> 32:31.250
- The kids' first assignment
in robotics

32:31.450 --> 32:32.850
was to build a drone.

32:33.050 --> 32:36.020
- So he launched the drones
with the incendiary devices.

32:38.920 --> 32:41.460
Then watched
both ignition points go up

32:41.660 --> 32:43.020
at the same time from here.

32:47.290 --> 32:48.860
Right here.

33:16.920 --> 33:18.960
I mean, we know of you,

33:19.160 --> 33:21.400
but we don't know anything
about you.

33:21.600 --> 33:22.960
What do you wanna know?

33:23.160 --> 33:25.100
- What do you like?
- What do you mean?

33:25.300 --> 33:27.440
- Tia likes mushrooms.
- [giggles]

33:27.630 --> 33:30.040

just getting stoned.

33:30.240 --> 33:31.940
Phoebe lives at the bottom

33:33.710 --> 33:35.680
that hammers down
the algorithm in his head.

33:35.880 --> 33:37.810
So what do you like?

33:38.010 --> 33:39.680
I like shrooms.

33:39.880 --> 33:41.020
[chuckles]

33:41.220 --> 33:44.690
- Do you like 'em
with girls or boys?

33:44.880 --> 33:46.750
- Or both?
- I don't like labels.

33:46.950 --> 33:48.420
Everyone likes labels.

33:48.620 --> 33:50.090
That's all
people care about these days.

33:50.290 --> 33:51.290
I don't label myself.

33:51.490 --> 33:53.330
You can't not label yourself.

33:53.530 --> 33:54.930
It's impossible.

33:55.130 --> 33:58.500
Saying you don't label yourself
is still labeling yourself.

33:58.700 --> 33:59.800
You're a non-labeler.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.140
That doesn't make sense.

34:01.340 --> 34:03.140
- The fact that
it doesn't make sense to you

34:03.340 --> 34:05.370
makes perfect sense.

34:05.570 --> 34:06.640
Labeler.

34:06.840 --> 34:08.240
Cyrus.

34:08.440 --> 34:10.640
Do you have anything to smoke?

34:10.840 --> 34:12.110
