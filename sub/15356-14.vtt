00:52.135 --> 00:54.045
Father!

01:30.755 --> 01:32.745
Father!

02:08.014 --> 02:10.485
What on earth have I done?

02:18.305 --> 02:20.205
<i>[Father]</i>

02:22.175 --> 02:25.985
<i>A man out for revenge
turns back to save a life?</i>

02:26.005 --> 02:29.285
<i>Then there's no meaning
in hitting Shik Joong.</i>

02:53.445 --> 02:55.995
Did you manipulate me?

02:56.225 --> 02:59.685
By having Shik Joong ahjussi
get hit by Kim Jong Shik's car?

02:59.695 --> 03:03.805
No, it was only made to look like
Kim Jong Shik's car.

03:03.835 --> 03:09.815
Then, Father, you did it yourself?

03:10.915 --> 03:13.255
To Shik Joong ahjussi?

03:13.705 --> 03:16.355
It brought immediate results, didn't it?

03:16.465 --> 03:19.205
What I want to see
is precisely this side of you.

03:19.225 --> 03:21.925
Eyes lit with fire, intent on revenge,

03:21.945 --> 03:23.295
you without any regard
for risk or consequence.

03:23.315 --> 03:25.785
Are you in your right mind?

03:26.385 --> 03:29.705
You drove Shik Joong ahjussi
to the brink of death?!

03:29.745 --> 03:33.715
You wanted me to kill someone
so badly you went to that length?!

03:33.725 --> 03:36.215
If you want to stop my madness,

03:36.235 --> 03:40.265
quickly embed those bastards' hearts
with bullets with your own hands.

03:41.715 --> 03:43.985
With your hands...

03:44.225 --> 03:45.955
With your hands...

03:47.455 --> 03:50.755
This is the way to protect those
who are precious to you.

03:50.775 --> 03:53.415
The more you drag out the time,

03:53.435 --> 03:56.725
the more pain those around you will face.

03:57.975 --> 04:00.585
That would be too heartbreaking.

04:02.365 --> 04:04.635
I've thought about it.

04:05.425 --> 04:08.385
Who could it be who is precious to you?

04:08.405 --> 04:10.545
I could think of no one.

04:10.565 --> 04:15.985
But, there is exactly one person.

04:30.225 --> 04:32.195
It is me.

04:32.215 --> 04:34.975
The person who is precious to you.

04:36.545 --> 04:39.005
Does this make your heart ache?

04:40.595 --> 04:42.965
It must hurt.

04:43.565 --> 04:45.735
It must...

04:45.985 --> 04:48.475
No matter how much you want me to,

04:49.525 --> 04:51.985
I cannot kill a person.

04:52.775 --> 04:55.775
I finally realized something clearly today.

04:56.545 --> 05:00.485
That your revenge and mine are different.

05:01.705 --> 05:05.755
That it's depressingly dirty.

05:32.015 --> 05:33.725
Shock!

05:33.745 --> 05:36.535
- 200 joules charge...
- Yes, 200 joules.

05:36.835 --> 05:38.495
Clear... Shock!

05:38.715 --> 05:41.205
Clear... Shock!

05:41.375 --> 05:43.665
- 200 joules charge...
- Yes, 200 joules.

05:43.685 --> 05:44.965
Clear...

05:45.015 --> 05:46.575
Shock!

05:47.235 --> 05:49.955
Didn't Kim Jong Shik jump,
trying to commit suicide?

05:50.005 --> 05:52.745
He was trying to grab
an envelope of documents or something...

05:54.585 --> 05:55.895
His heart...

05:55.915 --> 05:57.495
Please do something.

05:57.515 --> 05:58.565
Save him!

05:58.595 --> 05:59.615
Get the guardian out, hurry!

05:59.635 --> 06:01.095
Please, please...

06:01.115 --> 06:04.545
Shock!
Give it a big boost.

06:05.075 --> 06:07.455
Clear... Shock!

06:43.115 --> 06:44.725
Prosecutor.

06:51.145 --> 06:52.965
Your father...?

06:55.135 --> 06:57.825
Your car that was under the overpass,
I drove it here.

06:57.855 --> 07:00.655
Your father's car was taken
by the police for investigation.

07:00.695 --> 07:03.265
Where was the chauffeur?

07:03.295 --> 07:05.565
The chauffeur was having some coffee,
waiting to be called,

07:05.605 --> 07:07.985
when he heard about the accident.

07:08.085 --> 07:10.355
It has been confirmed
the chauffeur was not driving.

07:10.375 --> 07:13.439
And, according to eyewitnesses,

07:13.440 --> 07:17.333
your father fell
while trying to grab some documents.

07:17.485 --> 07:22.805
- Documents?
- And behind him, there was a masked man.

07:23.225 --> 07:27.515
I think you have a text message on
your phone, it's been ringing since earlier.

07:27.535 --> 07:29.675
Why don't you check it?

07:36.015 --> 07:39.995
<i>[Father]
I'm sorry. Next is Chun Jae Man.</i>

08:02.895 --> 08:06.465
Lee Yoon Sung, what happened?

08:08.355 --> 08:10.435
Did you hurt your hand?

08:10.795 --> 08:11.825
It's not a big wound.

08:11.865 --> 08:14.245
How can it not be a big wound
when it's bleeding so much?

08:14.285 --> 08:16.495
You should leave me too!

08:17.135 --> 08:20.065
Before you end up like Ahjussi here, leave!

08:20.845 --> 08:22.935
Lee Yoon Sung.

08:24.885 --> 08:26.965
It was Father.

08:28.165 --> 08:30.735
The person who made Ahjussi like this

08:31.075 --> 08:33.195
wasn't Kim Jong Shik,

08:33.965 --> 08:35.985
but Father.

08:37.184 --> 08:39.495
If it's for the sake of his revenge,

08:39.775 --> 08:42.495
he will try to manipulate me to the end.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.205
To Father, I'm...

08:49.285 --> 08:51.015
not a son,

08:53.005 --> 08:54.995
not Lee Yoon Sung,

08:55.105 --> 08:57.265
just a possession.

08:58.765 --> 09:01.515
I'll stay by your side.

09:02.105 --> 09:04.745
- I'll stay and...
- I...

09:06.775 --> 09:09.005
don't want anyone to get hurt

09:10.805 --> 09:13.015
or to lose anyone.

09:14.765 --> 09:17.015
All I need to do is stop seeing you.

09:19.075 --> 09:21.495
All I need to do is bear it.

09:22.905 --> 09:24.895
Yoon Sung.

09:24.915 --> 09:27.555
Do you know what I have done?

09:29.305 --> 09:31.985
I made Ahjussi end up like this.

09:33.245 --> 09:36.505
Even when Kim Jong Shik looked like
he was going to die, I pretended not to...

09:40.295 --> 09:44.755
I know that feeling well.

09:45.845 --> 09:49.015
Kim Jong Shik,
who took my parents from me...

09:50.835 --> 09:53.555
I wanted to kill him too.

09:54.305 --> 09:59.465
I wanted to make him pay in the same way.

10:02.035 --> 10:04.755
When I was lonely
and things were hard for me,

10:06.595 --> 10:08.805
I felt it even more.

10:09.825 --> 10:12.485
It wasn't you who did it.

10:14.645 --> 10:16.725
It was me.

10:17.435 --> 10:19.985
If you hadn't done it,

10:20.365 --> 10:22.205
I would have.

10:22.505 --> 10:27.245
So, don't torture yourself.

10:28.415 --> 10:30.775
Because I understand it all.

10:41.445 --> 10:43.905
<i>If these are sent
to the Prosecutor's Office,</i>

10:43.925 --> 10:46.605
<i>it's just a matter of time
before your son loses his position.</i>

10:46.625 --> 10:48.745
<i>Is this revenge for Operation Clean Sweep?</i>

10:48.765 --> 10:50.095
<i>I see you remember.</i>

10:50.115 --> 10:52.765
<i>Those who risked their lives
for the motherland,</i>

10:52.795 --> 10:54.534
<i>you sacrificed them
off the shores of Nampo...</i>

10:54.535 --> 10:55.735
The shores of Nampo...

10:55.765 --> 10:58.035
<i>and I suppose you lived happily.</i>

10:58.055 --> 11:00.605
<i>Living off students' money,</i>

11:00.625 --> 11:02.625
<i>and even covering up murder.</i>

11:02.645 --> 11:06.095
<i>I will make it
so that you will be captured by your son.</i>

11:06.115 --> 11:09.085
<i>Whatever you do, don't touch my son.</i>

12:11.095 --> 12:12.935
You...

12:13.575 --> 12:16.785
Don't ever get caught by someone else.

12:16.805 --> 12:18.995
I will get you.

12:20.385 --> 12:23.085
Whatever you do,
where ever you go,

12:23.125 --> 12:27.215
whomever you meet,
whatever you're thinking,

12:27.835 --> 12:31.845
just know I will be behind you watching.

12:37.435 --> 12:39.815
You must be feeling very outraged,

12:40.345 --> 12:42.955
seeing how you're taking out your anger
on anyone.

12:51.075 --> 12:53.215
You've wrinkled my clothes.

12:58.465 --> 13:00.995
You're no hero.

13:03.455 --> 13:05.835
Just a murderer...

13:38.685 --> 13:40.845
<i>I've never met anyone as intense as you.</i>

13:40.865 --> 13:44.315
You want to come into work
even after what happened yesterday?

13:44.335 --> 13:47.785
The Public Prosecutor's Office
will operate fine without you,

13:47.805 --> 13:50.205
so go home and rest for the time-being.

13:51.045 --> 13:53.635
- It's all right.
- Just because you act like this,

13:53.675 --> 13:56.585
do you think I'll put you
on the City Hunter case?

13:56.615 --> 13:59.735
If you're going to talk nonsense,
go home immediately.

13:59.755 --> 14:03.485
I will stay out of the City Hunter case.

14:03.655 --> 14:07.555
Instead, I will take Haewon Group's
Chun Jae Man's corruption case.

14:07.575 --> 14:08.925
What?

14:08.945 --> 14:10.145
I've uncovered some intelligence.

14:10.165 --> 14:11.775
When we were investigating
Lee Kyung Wan's slush fund,

14:11.795 --> 14:14.575
we found evidence that Haewon Construction
provided illegal campaign funds.

14:14.595 --> 14:15.411
Not only that,

14:15.412 --> 14:18.982
from tax evasion to construction bid
manipulation, the list goes on.

14:19.055 --> 14:21.535
Allow me to conduct a secret investigation.

14:21.565 --> 14:24.705
You want to investigate
Haewon Group's Chun Jae Man.

14:24.795 --> 14:27.425
You're against me, aren't you?

14:27.455 --> 14:29.785
While trying to catch that man,

14:29.805 --> 14:33.555
a former senior prosecutor had to resign
and the deputy prosecutor along with him.

14:33.575 --> 14:36.915
A section chief prosecutor like me...
I'm debris in a typhoon.

14:36.935 --> 14:38.440
That's why I'll carry out the investigation
in secret.

14:38.441 --> 14:42.695
You...
I know you're not feeling like yourself.

14:42.785 --> 14:46.365
But your good image is already
starting to tatter like an old rag,

14:46.405 --> 14:49.065
you're an eyewitness
to your father's concealment of a crime,

14:49.125 --> 14:52.205
and you're not making any progress
on the City Hunter investigation.

14:52.425 --> 14:55.895
If you make a mistake with this case too,

14:55.935 --> 14:58.785
you could really be sent to Marado*, Kid!
(*isolated island known for docile men )

14:59.535 --> 15:01.485
If I can't crack this case,

15:01.695 --> 15:03.775
I won't go to Marado.

15:04.655 --> 15:07.005
I'll resign.

15:11.595 --> 15:16.475
Then, I'll assume I have your approval
and start the investigation.

15:42.985 --> 15:47.075
Ah...
What brings you here, Miss Kim Na Na?

15:47.095 --> 15:51.685
I'm not really the type
who likes unexpected guests.

15:51.705 --> 15:54.725
You came in the same manner
to my house as well.

15:54.915 --> 15:59.305
And not knowing any better,
I treated you with sincerity.

15:59.345 --> 16:01.145
And how did you find me here?

16:01.195 --> 16:04.785
I found the address
on Lee Yoon Sung's GPS application.

16:11.425 --> 16:13.575
And what could be your reason
for coming to see me?

16:13.595 --> 16:16.015
Please let Lee Yoon Sung go.

16:16.995 --> 16:19.935
So Lee Yoon Sung can live like a human...

16:19.955 --> 16:22.205
So he can be happy...

16:22.325 --> 16:24.475
Let him go.

16:24.685 --> 16:26.225
You threaten me,

16:26.245 --> 16:29.205
you hit Shik Joong ahjussi with a car,

16:29.335 --> 16:33.935
and you want to manipulate
Lee Yoon Sung like a puppet.

16:35.455 --> 16:38.735
I see you know too much about us.

16:42.395 --> 16:44.215
But, you see,

16:44.645 --> 16:47.135
you might have been able to come in easily,

16:47.175 --> 16:49.485
but you won't be able to get out
quite so easily.

16:49.505 --> 16:52.485
If I were going to back down
because you threaten me like this,

16:52.505 --> 16:54.625
that would make me a coward.

16:54.665 --> 16:56.035
But, what are we to do?

16:56.065 --> 16:59.705
Having lived these years,
fighting this wretched world on my own,

16:59.725 --> 17:03.875
I've found that I couldn't
survive without staking my life.

17:04.454 --> 17:09.665
As Lee Yoon Sung's father,
don't you love Lee Yoon Sung?

17:09.685 --> 17:14.525
How much more must you destroy Lee Yoon Sung
before you stop?!

17:15.165 --> 17:18.744
How much more must Lee Yoon Sung
have to destroy before you stop?!

17:33.365 --> 17:37.995
Right here, right now,
I could kill you, Miss Na Na.

17:38.015 --> 17:39.965
That's okay.

17:40.545 --> 17:43.285
I'm a human bullet shield, anyway.

17:51.035 --> 17:55.775
That look in your eyes,
it would be a waste to kill off right now.

17:56.815 --> 17:59.755
Don't shake Lee Yoon Sung anymore.

18:00.315 --> 18:02.365
I won't stand for it.

18:02.405 --> 18:05.085
I will do everything in my power
to stop you.

18:05.105 --> 18:07.275
I came here to tell you that.

18:08.025 --> 18:12.515
I'll go now.
Lee Yoon Sung is waiting, you see.

18:33.725 --> 18:35.815
In a coma?

18:37.515 --> 18:41.495
It would have been better
if he had just died.

18:41.515 --> 18:44.775
At least it's a relief
he can't open his mouth,

18:45.475 --> 18:49.355
but monitor Kim Jong Shik's condition
carefully.

18:49.375 --> 18:53.235
If, by any chance,
it looks like he might wake up,

18:55.395 --> 18:56.975
get rid of him.

18:57.005 --> 18:59.695
Yes, Sir, don't worry.

18:59.875 --> 19:02.935
I've already got plenty of headaches
because of the Han-Il Life merger.

19:02.955 --> 19:06.505
Lee Kyung Wan, Seo Yong Hak,
and now Kim Jong Shik.

19:06.915 --> 19:09.675
He's definitely an elusive guy.

19:09.725 --> 19:12.765
For the time being,
I think it's best to leave the country...

19:12.785 --> 19:14.495
No.

19:15.335 --> 19:19.485
It's rude to go out
when you're expecting a guest.

19:19.505 --> 19:22.205
We should prepare to greet our guest.

19:22.255 --> 19:25.845
Do you have another plan?

19:27.545 --> 19:29.515
It's an all-out war!

19:30.515 --> 19:32.765
Before the bastard comes charging,

19:33.775 --> 19:36.855
I will drag him up to the surface first!

19:44.755 --> 19:47.135
Didn't I tell you not to go around alone?!

19:47.155 --> 19:49.305
I looked for you for a long time...

19:49.795 --> 19:51.275
And why did you turn off your phone?

19:51.315 --> 19:54.095
I left you a note.
Didn't you see it?

19:54.115 --> 19:56.025
Come on, let's go in.

19:57.695 --> 19:59.435
Are you all right?

19:59.475 --> 20:00.435
About what?

20:00.455 --> 20:02.255
Kim Young Joo.

20:02.595 --> 20:06.155
It must have been a big shock
to find out he was Kim Jong Shik's son.

20:06.195 --> 20:08.785
You knew, didn't you?

20:08.815 --> 20:11.255
That's why you wouldn't let me listen in
on the bugged conversation

20:11.275 --> 20:13.735
or watch the secret video.

20:13.925 --> 20:15.775
I should have figured it out.

20:15.795 --> 20:17.505
Really...

20:17.805 --> 20:19.545
Are you really okay?

20:19.565 --> 20:21.215
What can I do if I'm not?

20:21.255 --> 20:23.695
It doesn't change the facts.

20:23.785 --> 20:26.475
<i>When the City Hunter delivered them
to the Prosecutor's Office,</i>

20:26.505 --> 20:28.195
<i>Lee Kyung Wan and</i>

20:28.215 --> 20:31.745
<i>Seo Yong Hak had army tags
around their necks, do you remember?</i>

20:31.765 --> 20:36.095
<i>Those army ID tags are from October, 1983,</i>

20:36.115 --> 20:40.255
<i>and belong to a special forces unit
that has been reported missing.</i>

20:40.275 --> 20:41.745
<i>Those soldiers</i>

20:41.775 --> 20:46.825
<i>were in the process of fleeing
after stealing classified military secrets</i>

20:47.035 --> 20:52.415
<i>when they were killed
in the open waters by our military.</i>

20:52.435 --> 20:54.625
Why has this case been concealed?

20:54.645 --> 20:58.155
As director of the Agency for National
Security Planning at the time,

20:58.175 --> 21:00.535
I received the reports of that case.

21:00.575 --> 21:05.865
But, at the time, because of the Aung San
case and the KAL airliner bombing,

21:05.885 --> 21:09.915
citizens' doubt and anxiety
over their safety was at an all-time high.

21:09.935 --> 21:13.295
Thankfully, before the classified
military secrets were circulated,

21:13.315 --> 21:16.165
the soldiers were shot dead

21:16.185 --> 21:19.315
and it was decided
to keep the case undisclosed.

21:19.335 --> 21:22.699
Then, the City Hunter
could be connected to that case.

21:22.700 --> 21:23.919
That's right.

21:24.755 --> 21:27.625
All of the recent activities
of the City Hunter

21:27.645 --> 21:29.915
precisely are retaliations
for that incident,

21:29.935 --> 21:33.945
and attempts to drown our social
infrastructure in confusion and division.

21:33.965 --> 21:38.015
<i>Ladies and Gentlemen, you must not forget.</i>

21:38.055 --> 21:40.025
<i>The City Hunter is not a hero,</i>

21:40.045 --> 21:43.495
<i>but a criminal who has betrayed his country.</i>

21:44.845 --> 21:46.475
<i>That is all.</i>

21:50.195 --> 21:52.555
Chun Jae Man...

21:52.785 --> 21:55.675
So you were the fourth out of the five.

21:55.725 --> 21:57.455
Can you believe that?

21:57.505 --> 22:00.195
Calling those betrayed by the motherland
criminals?

22:00.225 --> 22:01.955
I can no longer put up with this.

22:01.975 --> 22:05.065
We cannot let his scheme make us irrational.

22:06.135 --> 22:10.225
They end 20 lives and he covers it
as punishment for a crime.

22:10.245 --> 22:13.095
And declaring war against us
on top of that...

22:13.195 --> 22:15.405
Interesting.

22:15.815 --> 22:17.815
Since the bastard
has turned on the lighting,

22:17.845 --> 22:19.365
we should step up onto the stage.

22:19.385 --> 22:21.935
The security won't be easy to pass,

22:21.955 --> 22:23.905
but I will get through somehow.

22:23.925 --> 22:25.875
There's no need.

22:25.895 --> 22:30.115
I can meet him as Korean expatriate
from the US Steve Lee.

22:30.695 --> 22:34.085
The reason I stacked up dirty drug money

22:34.125 --> 22:37.745
was to get that dirt on those bastards.

22:40.355 --> 22:42.605
Now the time has come.

22:42.625 --> 22:45.755
Who's calling whom a criminal?

22:47.255 --> 22:49.415
I see you've come out on your own,

22:49.435 --> 22:51.445
Chairman Chun Jae Man.

22:51.745 --> 22:55.985
I think this hospital
is owned by Haewon Group.

22:56.695 --> 23:00.255
Excuse me,
you're Bae Shik Joong's guardian, right?

23:02.435 --> 23:03.695
Ahjussi.

23:03.725 --> 23:05.945
Ahjussi, are you awake now?

23:06.145 --> 23:07.935
Ahjussi.

23:09.885 --> 23:11.855
Huh... Why am I here?

23:11.885 --> 23:15.695
Do you know how scared I was?!
Huh?

23:16.075 --> 23:17.345
Thank you.

23:17.365 --> 23:19.185
Thank you for being alive.

23:19.205 --> 23:22.115
Thank you for not leaving me alone.

23:22.135 --> 23:23.725
Yoon Sung.

23:24.735 --> 23:27.255
I found your mom.

23:28.475 --> 23:29.935
Huh?

23:30.855 --> 23:32.955
Your mom...

23:33.685 --> 23:35.675
I found her.

23:37.585 --> 23:40.255
Bota Temple.

23:40.855 --> 23:42.745
Bota Temple?

23:56.705 --> 24:00.455
I told her we needed to go to the hospital,
but she refused.

24:00.475 --> 24:02.485
She said
now that her son knows she's here,

24:02.505 --> 24:04.175
he might come looking for her.

24:04.205 --> 24:06.705
And that you must not miss each other
in passing.

24:06.895 --> 24:10.995
Aigoo...
Please take her to a hospital quickly.

24:42.605 --> 24:44.505
My baby...

24:48.215 --> 24:50.205
My son?

24:58.535 --> 25:01.985
I've never forgotten you for a single day,

25:04.065 --> 25:07.235
but I didn't know it was you when I saw you.

25:08.285 --> 25:11.965
How upset you must have been
when I didn't know it was you.

25:11.985 --> 25:13.635
Son...

25:14.765 --> 25:16.765
My Son...

25:18.885 --> 25:20.895
I'm sorry.

25:20.915 --> 25:23.485
I'm so sorry.

25:24.855 --> 25:26.995
I'm sorry.

25:35.825 --> 25:37.855
I'm sorry.

25:41.065 --> 25:43.485
M... Mom.

25:47.625 --> 25:49.545
Mom.

26:13.875 --> 26:17.475
She must be moved to a sterile room
and undergo chemotherapy.

26:17.495 --> 26:20.625
Sometimes between parents and children,
a match can be found,

26:20.645 --> 26:22.685
making a bone marrow transplant possible.

26:22.705 --> 26:26.495
So, as you wait for your test results,

26:26.535 --> 26:28.485
you should take care of your body.

26:28.505 --> 26:30.225
Doctor.

26:30.965 --> 26:33.175
May I talk to you for a moment?

26:33.535 --> 26:37.035
Take the patient on secretly?

26:37.055 --> 26:38.165
Yes.

26:38.185 --> 26:43.545
The patient feels she's in danger,
so she keeps rejecting treatment.

26:43.965 --> 26:46.005
Uh... a stalker.

26:46.025 --> 26:48.295
Yes, you can look at it
like she has a stalker.

26:48.315 --> 26:50.155
A stalker?

26:50.185 --> 26:54.225
I will pay the hospital bills all in cash.

26:54.335 --> 26:56.455
Well then,

26:56.815 --> 27:00.675
shall I record it as a foreigner
who has come in for treatment?

27:00.715 --> 27:03.095
Please, Doctor...

27:03.115 --> 27:05.085
We need to save a person's life
first and foremost.

27:05.105 --> 27:07.335
It seems
there are some adverse circumstances,

27:07.375 --> 27:09.195
so let's do it that way.

27:27.035 --> 27:29.755
Let's get you checked into a sterile room.

27:30.205 --> 27:32.025
All right.

27:32.735 --> 27:34.795
I need to.

27:36.055 --> 27:39.955
Now that there's a reason I must live.

27:41.795 --> 27:43.765
But...

27:44.945 --> 27:49.995
Today, let's get out of here.
Hmm?

27:50.555 --> 27:53.445
Do you know what the situation is right now?

27:53.465 --> 27:55.655
It's dangerous right now.

27:55.675 --> 27:58.175
If I check in now,

27:58.715 --> 28:02.505
I may never be able to go out again.

28:04.175 --> 28:07.495
This may be the last chance I get.

28:08.155 --> 28:10.235
Don't say things like that.

28:10.775 --> 28:14.155
I've met my son
for the first time in 28 years.

28:14.455 --> 28:16.535
I want to feed him,

28:17.135 --> 28:20.755
cook for him with my own hands
at least once.

28:21.285 --> 28:24.715
If I can't cook and feed you even once

28:24.865 --> 28:27.215
before I leave this world,

28:27.665 --> 28:30.735
I don't think I could rest in peace.

28:33.005 --> 28:35.015
That's why...

28:40.415 --> 28:43.235
More than living one more day,

28:43.515 --> 28:49.475
I want to cook for my son.

28:52.235 --> 28:55.215
And see him eating it heartily...

28:57.565 --> 29:02.475
That...
I'd like to see that at least once.

29:23.525 --> 29:24.985
Oh!

29:25.977 --> 29:27.239
Oh, my...

29:27.474 --> 29:30.525
I had an injection at the hospital
so I'm all right.

29:30.845 --> 29:33.185
Um, wait just a little bit.

29:33.205 --> 29:35.175
I'll cook quickly and bring it out.

29:35.195 --> 29:36.735
The weather's nice.

29:36.755 --> 29:38.965
Should we eat on the wooden platform?

29:39.735 --> 29:41.325
Yes.

29:46.975 --> 29:51.555
They all say my doenjang jjigae* is good.
(*fermented bean paste stew)

29:59.465 --> 30:01.265
I'm sorry.

30:03.425 --> 30:05.735
I thought you abandoned me,

30:06.255 --> 30:08.715
and I grew up hating you.

30:10.685 --> 30:13.485
I came to see how well you were living

30:14.235 --> 30:16.465
after abandoning me,

30:17.405 --> 30:20.025
but seeing you sick and miserable

30:20.685 --> 30:22.695
made me angry.

30:23.445 --> 30:26.035
I thought, "If she had abandoned me,
she should be living well."

30:26.745 --> 30:30.515
"Why is she in this state?"

30:33.275 --> 30:34.995
Possibly because

30:36.765 --> 30:39.425
I couldn't hate you if you died,

30:39.725 --> 30:41.735
I decided I must save you.

30:43.965 --> 30:46.495
So that I could hate you
as much as I wanted,

30:47.045 --> 30:49.295
I decided I must save you.

30:51.095 --> 30:53.285
That's what I thought.

30:54.865 --> 30:57.225
That's what I thought, I'm sorry.

31:08.765 --> 31:10.435
No.

31:10.845 --> 31:13.025
I'm sorry.

31:14.415 --> 31:16.775
Your mom is sorry.

31:19.385 --> 31:22.255
I couldn't protect you.

31:23.475 --> 31:26.755
And, I didn't know you when I saw you.

31:27.055 --> 31:28.935
And,

31:29.265 --> 31:32.815
for meeting you in these circumstances
and putting you in pain,

31:33.055 --> 31:35.235
I'm so sorry.

31:37.375 --> 31:43.245
I will... live.

31:45.945 --> 31:47.675
Yoon Sung.

31:49.375 --> 31:52.755
Let's live a long.

31:53.375 --> 31:56.245
A long and happy life...

32:11.285 --> 32:13.015
Yes.

32:15.545 --> 32:18.215
Yes, Mom.

32:59.965 --> 33:03.795
You dare to disobey my order
because of your compassion?

33:05.105 --> 33:07.135
I'll forgive you this one time,

33:07.155 --> 33:08.635
but next time,

33:08.655 --> 33:11.485
I won't make an exception for you.

33:12.485 --> 33:14.225
I'm sorry.

33:33.305 --> 33:38.515
Can you two understand me as I am?

33:44.205 --> 33:45.475
Eat.

33:45.515 --> 33:49.475
Summer salted fish
has to be salty to be tasty.

33:55.625 --> 33:57.725
You don't eat beans?

33:58.795 --> 34:00.545
You're the same.

34:00.565 --> 34:03.885
Father didn't eat beans either?

34:03.915 --> 34:05.435
Uh?

34:06.585 --> 34:08.235
Yeah.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.725
The doenjang jjigae is really good.

34:11.745 --> 34:14.195
Even better than Shik Joong ahjussi's...

34:14.764 --> 34:16.955
Shik Joong ahjussi?

34:17.665 --> 34:19.155
Yes.

34:19.545 --> 34:22.245
To me, he's like a mother,

34:22.264 --> 34:24.195
like an older brother,

34:24.215 --> 34:26.525
and like an older sister.

34:27.445 --> 34:33.205
Did Jin Pyo continue to raise you?

34:33.255 --> 34:34.705
Yes.

34:34.985 --> 34:37.745
He had really high ambitions for me.

34:37.775 --> 34:43.014
So, he wanted me
to excel in my studies, in sports.

34:43.034 --> 34:47.475
His leg is like that because of me.

34:48.054 --> 34:51.455
It happened while he was saving me
when I got into trouble.

34:51.844 --> 34:53.725
He did?

34:56.085 --> 34:58.005
I'm grateful.

34:59.295 --> 35:02.225
And he's not putting you in danger?

35:03.795 --> 35:05.955
How could that be?

35:07.535 --> 35:12.015
What was Father like?

35:16.625 --> 35:24.715
Your father was warm-hearted and manly.

35:26.175 --> 35:28.485
He saved me,

35:29.685 --> 35:31.675
and saved you.

35:32.645 --> 35:33.665
By the way,

35:33.685 --> 35:35.235
that bandage on your hand...

35:35.275 --> 35:37.715
What happened?
Did you hurt yourself?

35:37.995 --> 35:40.375
I was exercising and hurt it slightly.

35:40.395 --> 35:44.225
Oh, you should be more careful.
It doesn't hurt?

35:45.105 --> 35:51.085
I suppose it's a very sad thing to lose
someone who's precious to you, right?

35:52.105 --> 35:55.535
To take away someone
who is precious to someone else,

35:55.925 --> 35:57.955
to hurt them...

35:59.535 --> 36:01.765
Those will all be punished.

36:02.305 --> 36:03.635
Whatever the reason...

36:03.675 --> 36:06.025
Is something going on?

36:06.695 --> 36:10.975
Tell me, Yoon Sung.

36:11.365 --> 36:13.185
No.

36:13.545 --> 36:18.005
It's just our story.

36:20.575 --> 36:22.455
The doenjang jjigae is really good.

36:22.475 --> 36:24.515
I can eat it all, right?

36:29.095 --> 36:30.725
Have some.

37:21.775 --> 37:24.225
The Han-Il Life acquisition,

37:24.245 --> 37:27.695
we've pushed it forward,
even though the creditors oppose it.

37:27.735 --> 37:30.475
If the creditors find out it's in the hole,

37:30.495 --> 37:33.475
it's certain they'll demand
a debt-for-equity conversion.

37:33.835 --> 37:37.645
Aigoo, there's a walkout
on the construction side too.

37:37.675 --> 37:39.745
The money sources have all dried out.

37:39.765 --> 37:42.125
Should I look into moneylenders
on the Myeongdong side?

37:42.145 --> 37:43.945
Are you nuts?

37:44.305 --> 37:48.465
Then, they'll certainly ask for stock
as collateral.

37:49.495 --> 37:53.195
Isn't there anyone who wants
to roll around 500 billion won in cash?

37:53.215 --> 37:55.015
Chairman.

37:55.145 --> 37:59.815
Actually, there's someone who wants
to meet with you regarding investing.

37:59.855 --> 38:01.445
Who is it?

38:01.635 --> 38:03.111
He's a Korean expatriate
who owns a deer farm in the US

38:03.112 --> 38:05.970
and makes his money through agriculture.

38:06.155 --> 38:07.615
From the outside,
it looks like a small company,

38:07.635 --> 38:11.185
but we've found out that
his cash assets are quite considerable.

38:11.205 --> 38:13.155
He particularly has strong personal
connections with the Republican Party

38:13.175 --> 38:16.435
so his power even has influence
in the US Senate.

38:16.475 --> 38:17.715
Are you certain?

38:17.745 --> 38:18.725
Yes.

38:18.765 --> 38:20.375
His identity, his assets,

38:20.395 --> 38:22.945
and his credit have all been confirmed.

38:38.605 --> 38:40.675
I'm Steve Lee.

38:42.415 --> 38:44.495
I'm Chun Jae Man.

38:51.705 --> 38:53.525
Ahjussi.

38:55.265 --> 38:57.165
Yoon Sung.

38:58.245 --> 38:59.335
I'm sorry.

38:59.355 --> 39:01.945
I should have stayed with you.

39:02.335 --> 39:03.465
Are you feeling okay?

39:03.485 --> 39:05.545
Yeah, I'm all right.

39:05.565 --> 39:08.005
What are we going to do about your mom?

39:08.495 --> 39:10.445
Even if I pay the hospital bills with cash,

39:10.465 --> 39:12.115
and no matter how well she's hidden,

39:12.135 --> 39:13.915
it's a matter of time before she's found.

39:13.935 --> 39:15.095
Just in case,

39:15.115 --> 39:17.105
I've looked into a hospital in the US
as well.

39:17.125 --> 39:18.605
When the first phase is complete,

39:18.625 --> 39:20.775
I'm going to take her to the US.

39:21.225 --> 39:23.235
You're leaving?

39:23.575 --> 39:25.715
I have to save my mom.

39:39.875 --> 39:41.485
Here.

39:42.785 --> 39:46.535
Sometimes, it's refreshing and
can open up that blocked feeling inside.

39:47.135 --> 39:49.045
Are you happy being with me?

39:49.065 --> 39:51.135
Why ask that all of a sudden?

39:51.165 --> 39:52.935
Aren't you scared?

39:53.405 --> 39:55.355
Doesn't it give you the chills?

39:55.375 --> 39:58.275
Shik Joong ahjussi woke up fast.

39:58.295 --> 40:01.395
I'm sure that man will also wake up.

40:01.415 --> 40:03.534
- So, don't feel too guilty...
- I'm someone

40:03.535 --> 40:05.391
who you never know
if I'll be there the next day.

40:05.505 --> 40:06.775
If you're with me,

40:06.795 --> 40:09.235
you could be endangered too.

40:13.115 --> 40:16.475
I told you my feelings are mine.

40:16.885 --> 40:19.195
I won't ask you
to take responsibility for them,

40:19.215 --> 40:20.995
so don't worry.

40:25.475 --> 40:26.995
Uh...

40:45.885 --> 40:48.045
You go on out to the car first.

40:56.285 --> 41:01.515
This is our health center
for our VVIP clients.

41:01.535 --> 41:05.115
Why don't you get a health exam
while you're here?

41:05.135 --> 41:08.065
Today, I've come only to take a look
around the hospital,

41:08.085 --> 41:10.555
so I'll take a rain check on the exam.

41:10.575 --> 41:15.495
The interior of the hospital is very nice.

41:17.405 --> 41:19.145
Didn't I tell you?

41:19.165 --> 41:23.485
They're no longer patients, but clients.

41:23.655 --> 41:26.615
Whether they're patients or clients, it's
how much money they have that's important.

41:26.635 --> 41:31.215
And I only invest in profitable businesses.

41:32.315 --> 41:35.525
Please excuse me for a moment.
Why don't you go on in first.

41:35.585 --> 41:37.235
Okay.

41:41.525 --> 41:43.895
So, you're going to invest in this hospital?

41:43.915 --> 41:45.805
For the bastard who knows only money,

41:45.825 --> 41:47.865
what else can be used but money
for bait?

41:47.885 --> 41:50.985
With that bait, you could also suffer.

41:51.095 --> 41:54.115
Chun Jae Man is absolutely no easy target.

41:54.135 --> 41:56.295
I don't think you have time
to be worrying about me.

41:56.315 --> 41:58.695
I'm not worrying.

41:59.105 --> 42:03.645
I'm just here to tell you
not to get in my way.

42:08.015 --> 42:11.035
I see you're getting more and more arrogant.

42:12.015 --> 42:14.225
Watch carefully what I do.

42:14.635 --> 42:20.605
One must take revenge
as if it were really revenge.

42:20.975 --> 42:23.005
As I do.

42:39.345 --> 42:41.875
Why is your father here?

42:41.895 --> 42:44.655
Wasn't the man next to him
Chairman Chun Jae Man?

42:44.695 --> 42:46.605
Father has started to make his move.

42:46.625 --> 42:48.615
Then what about your mother?

42:48.645 --> 42:49.905
Don't you have to move her
to another hospital?

42:49.925 --> 42:51.935
It could actually be safer here.

42:51.965 --> 42:54.505
Because it's often things right under
your nose that are hardest to find...

42:54.535 --> 42:56.055
Let's go home and talk.

42:56.075 --> 42:57.745
Let's go to my house.

42:57.765 --> 42:58.835
Your house?

42:58.855 --> 43:00.825
Why?
Is there something you need to get there?

43:00.845 --> 43:02.455
I've moved all my stuff.

43:02.475 --> 43:05.515
It's not dangerous anymore, so I'll go home.

43:05.945 --> 43:07.875
I've left it empty too long.

43:07.895 --> 43:10.935
My wound has gotten a lot better,
and I need to give Ddorong some attention.

43:10.955 --> 43:13.595
And it's been so long since I've been
to the Blue House, I might get fired.

43:13.615 --> 43:16.995
You know Chief Park is looking
for any chance he can get to wring my neck.

43:17.935 --> 43:21.215
But, even if I go home,
you can't leave me out of the operation.

43:21.255 --> 43:23.785
You know there's no better partner
than I, right?

43:25.175 --> 43:27.125
Are you mad?

43:27.145 --> 43:29.955
Because I moved my stuff
without saying anything?

43:29.975 --> 43:31.455
Forget it.

43:31.475 --> 43:34.045
Living with you,
my refrigerator almost broke down.

43:34.065 --> 43:34.855
So, it's good you're leaving.

43:34.875 --> 43:36.635
What?

43:38.905 --> 43:40.445
Let's go.

43:45.245 --> 43:46.955
Oh!

43:48.455 --> 43:52.895
Whoa... You comment about
how I just charge into a man's room,

43:52.915 --> 43:55.465
and you come into a house where
a woman lives alone and lie down like that?

43:55.485 --> 43:57.105
This house is under my name.

43:57.135 --> 43:59.205
Oh, geez...

43:59.375 --> 44:02.095
Do you really think it will be all right,
you staying here alone?

44:02.145 --> 44:03.345
It could be dangerous.

44:03.365 --> 44:06.495
You're more dangerous to me.

44:06.875 --> 44:08.485
Get up.

44:15.315 --> 44:16.985
What about me?

44:17.005 --> 44:18.465
Why me?

44:18.485 --> 44:20.475
What did I do?

44:22.065 --> 44:24.225
Why are you acting this way?

44:25.275 --> 44:26.725
What?

44:26.755 --> 44:30.025
I've thought about
the total amount I've stacked up,

44:30.475 --> 44:32.765
and you're just too expensive.

44:35.205 --> 44:36.705
Ow.

44:37.755 --> 44:39.215
You just hit my shoulder.

44:39.235 --> 44:40.755
How much was a shoulder again?

44:40.775 --> 44:41.845
How much was it?

44:41.875 --> 44:43.115
100,000 won.

44:43.135 --> 44:44.445
Give me 100,000 won, c'mon.

44:44.465 --> 44:48.335
It wasn't like I touched you,
I just had no choice but to push off you.

44:48.355 --> 44:50.285
Don't make excuses.
Give me 100,000 won!

44:50.305 --> 44:51.465
Hand it over, quick.
Give it to me.

44:51.485 --> 44:54.955
All right then,
let me make you a killer cup of coffee.

44:54.975 --> 44:56.435
Wait.

44:57.635 --> 44:59.535
Is coffee 100,000 won?

44:59.565 --> 45:01.705
Everything is expensive with you.

45:01.725 --> 45:06.175
Now, even when I just see a coffee packet,
I think of you.

45:06.195 --> 45:09.025
Even when I just smell coffee, I remember.

45:09.045 --> 45:12.085
"Kim Na Na, bring me some coffee."
Just like that.

45:15.705 --> 45:17.355
Here.

45:18.045 --> 45:19.155
I'm not drinking it.

45:19.235 --> 45:20.035
Why not?

45:20.055 --> 45:23.055
Are you resisting
because it's a 100,000 won coffee?

45:23.695 --> 45:25.945
I'm not drinking coffee anymore.

45:26.225 --> 45:27.915
I quit.

45:30.055 --> 45:31.725
I'm going.

45:31.895 --> 45:33.425
Lock the doors well.

45:33.445 --> 45:35.585
And if anything happens, call me right away.

45:35.605 --> 45:37.215
I'm going.

45:43.375 --> 45:45.475
What's up with him?

45:45.625 --> 45:48.515
Is he really peeved
because I didn't give him 100,000 won?

45:49.315 --> 45:52.015
You think of me
when you even just see coffee?

45:55.155 --> 45:57.005
You can't...

46:33.535 --> 46:35.185
Prosecutor.

46:36.855 --> 46:39.555
Chairman Chun Jae Man
and Steve Lee met, and...

46:39.575 --> 46:41.245
They met?

46:41.265 --> 46:42.255
You didn't know?

46:42.275 --> 46:44.225
Isn't it odd that the two of them met?

46:44.245 --> 46:46.145
It seems there's some connection
with the City Hunter,

46:46.365 --> 46:49.665
and it's also strange that Chun Jae Man,
who was silent,

46:49.666 --> 46:51.331
suddenly brings up a 1983 case.

46:51.335 --> 46:53.225
My seasoned investigative senses tell me,

46:53.245 --> 46:54.475
there's something there for sure.

46:54.515 --> 46:56.315
What about the article I mentioned?
Did you find it?

46:56.355 --> 46:58.368
I copied articles
on the KAL airliner explosion

46:58.369 --> 47:00.069
and Aung San case
that Chun Jae Man mentioned.

47:00.075 --> 47:01.575
Take a look.

47:03.915 --> 47:07.120
Due to this disaster, the rest of the
President's tour schedule

47:07.121 --> 47:08.361
has been cancelled
and he has rushed back to Korea.

47:08.365 --> 47:09.265
[List of Survivors]

47:09.285 --> 47:12.695
Presidential Security Service Agents,
Park Mu Yeol, Lee Jin Pyo...

47:13.485 --> 47:15.285
Lee Kyung Hee's husband's name
was Park Mu Yeol, wasn't it?

47:15.305 --> 47:16.765
Uh? It was.

47:16.785 --> 47:19.395
There's no personnel file at the Blue House,
but he's mentioned in the article.

47:19.415 --> 47:20.555
Something smells fishy.

47:20.575 --> 47:21.795
Let's go to the Blue House
Presidential Security Service immediately.

47:21.815 --> 47:23.055
Yes.

47:23.105 --> 47:25.025
Unni, hurry up!

47:25.055 --> 47:27.895
Da Hye, Agent Shin, I'm back to work.

47:28.075 --> 47:29.805
Da Hye!

47:30.235 --> 47:32.845
Where is she going, all worked up like that?

47:34.045 --> 47:35.585
Oh?

47:35.605 --> 47:38.075
Miss Da Hye, what are you doing here?

47:38.095 --> 47:39.445
Dr. Lee Yoon Sung...

47:39.465 --> 47:41.115
You're finally back.

47:41.135 --> 47:44.305
Now, you can tutor me again, right?

47:44.325 --> 47:45.585
Yes?

47:45.615 --> 47:48.285
Please tutor her
every afternoon of the week.

47:48.305 --> 47:53.795
So then our Da Hye won't skip
her lessons and I can go home.

47:54.045 --> 47:55.145
Look, look.

47:55.185 --> 47:59.315
How can you quit when there are
so many people waiting for you, Dr. Lee?

47:59.365 --> 48:02.725
I've recorded all the days
you were out as vacation days.

48:02.745 --> 48:04.175
That sounds good, right?

48:04.205 --> 48:06.875
Then, I can't go on vacation.

48:06.895 --> 48:10.135
If I can't see bikini-clad women
in the summer, I'll die of some eye disease.

48:10.155 --> 48:13.365
Oh my, Teacher...
Do you want to go to the beach with me?

48:13.385 --> 48:15.355
I have a bikini.

48:18.405 --> 48:19.345
You can't go to the beach.

48:19.365 --> 48:21.355
It's too hard to guard you.

48:21.375 --> 48:22.835
Let's go to a pool.

48:22.875 --> 48:25.165
I have a bikini too.

48:28.465 --> 48:30.135
Aren't you all going back to your work?

48:30.155 --> 48:34.015
Really, is this some sort of joke room
or something?

48:34.035 --> 48:36.345
Da Hye, let's go.
This isn't going to work.

48:51.125 --> 48:53.155
<i>Give me my 100,000 won.</i>

48:54.895 --> 48:56.115
<i>I won't rip you off.</i>

48:56.135 --> 48:58.945
<i>Mr. Unlucky Jerk, have you seen
your biological father's face?</i>

48:58.965 --> 49:01.445
<i>There are Security Service albums.</i>

49:15.715 --> 49:17.665
Are you looking for this?

49:23.845 --> 49:26.315
Why did you come all the way here
and look for this?

49:26.355 --> 49:31.905
I'm just really curious
about what happened in October of 1983.

49:46.905 --> 49:48.605
<i>[Park Mu Yeol]</i>

49:49.205 --> 49:50.855
Father.

49:51.005 --> 49:55.345
<i>[Lee Jin Pyo]</i>

50:10.245 --> 50:11.905
Lee Jin Pyo...

50:18.695 --> 50:20.865
Lee Jin Pyo.

50:23.475 --> 50:27.325
I see that you were a
Presidential Security Service agent in 1983.

50:27.395 --> 50:29.765
And you safely survived
the Aung San terrorist attack.

50:29.795 --> 50:31.865
So, you've found out at last?

50:31.915 --> 50:33.885
That's not the only time I survived.

50:33.905 --> 50:35.835
Why did you lie to me?

50:35.855 --> 50:37.545
As though you were
a Korean living in the US...

50:37.565 --> 50:39.261
Because I'd be viewed
through a different lens

50:39.262 --> 50:41.880
if I said I was once
a Presidential Security agent.

50:41.895 --> 50:44.035
I succeeded on my own.

50:44.055 --> 50:45.365
I felt it was unfair.

50:45.385 --> 50:48.555
So, you laundered your identity
because of that?

50:48.575 --> 50:51.615
Something smells awfully fishy.

50:51.745 --> 50:55.105
Why did I have to launder my identity?

50:56.195 --> 50:58.015
Because back then, during that incident,

50:58.035 --> 51:01.055
I washed my soul in the sea.

51:01.085 --> 51:03.265
That incident back then?

51:03.475 --> 51:06.825
Try to figure out
what that incident back then was,

51:06.845 --> 51:07.895
Mr. Prosecutor.

51:07.915 --> 51:12.605
I suppose there's some reason
that you contacted Chairman Chun Jae Man.

51:12.865 --> 51:15.215
Are you saying you are no longer hiding,
but coming out into the sunlight?

51:15.235 --> 51:16.865
Sunlight?

51:16.885 --> 51:20.485
I'm already living fine
in a nice bright place.

51:23.735 --> 51:27.145
My father left it for me,
like a final testament.

51:27.505 --> 51:29.885
That Chun Jae Man is next...

51:37.255 --> 51:39.355
Would you like a glass?

51:53.235 --> 51:55.005
Why pick that?

51:55.025 --> 51:56.655
Picking something so expensive...

51:56.675 --> 51:59.125
Why are we here?

51:59.145 --> 52:00.875
Come here.

52:04.455 --> 52:05.965
Okay...
Pick from here.

52:05.995 --> 52:07.455
How is this 100,000 won?

52:07.475 --> 52:11.455
10,000 won from stingy Kim Na Na's wallet
is equal to 100,000 won.

52:11.495 --> 52:14.095
And I'm sure
it will be several 10,000 won bills.

52:14.115 --> 52:16.405
Hurry up and pick
before I change my mind.

52:16.445 --> 52:22.375
- 5, 4, 3, 2, 1...
- This! This one, this one, this one...

52:22.555 --> 52:25.915
It's a present to celebrate
coming back to work, so wear it well.

52:34.225 --> 52:37.655
I've bought you a necktie now,
so you have to include me now.

52:37.685 --> 52:38.385
Hey.

52:38.415 --> 52:39.965
Include me.

52:39.985 --> 52:40.925
Hey, Bear Na Na.

52:40.965 --> 52:42.935
How many times do I have to tell you
for you to understand?

52:42.965 --> 52:44.245
Do you have several lives?

52:44.265 --> 52:46.605
I'm a 4th degree black belt in Judo.

52:48.635 --> 52:50.095
Fine.

52:50.585 --> 52:52.295
I'm going to work right now.

52:52.315 --> 52:54.015
There will absolutely be no regrets, okay?

52:54.035 --> 52:55.895
Yes, okay!

52:59.025 --> 53:01.295
It's room 1205.

53:01.315 --> 53:02.535
Have a nice evening.

53:02.555 --> 53:04.115
Let's go.

53:15.365 --> 53:20.375
Today too, I had such a rough day,
converting 500 million won into ready money.

53:20.845 --> 53:25.985
One apple carton...
It was exactly 500 million won.

53:26.005 --> 53:27.915
Why did he make you do it?

53:27.935 --> 53:29.245
Why doesn't he do it himself?

53:29.265 --> 53:31.895
I think it was the District Office
documents manager or something.

53:31.945 --> 53:33.935
He said he's going to give it to him.

53:33.955 --> 53:38.755
Tomorrow at 4,
they're meeting at the office.

53:38.775 --> 53:42.005
Ah, our chairman's best weapon

53:42.025 --> 53:43.805
is cash.

53:45.115 --> 53:46.695
Tomorrow?

53:46.915 --> 53:51.125
You're going to make me happy today,
aren't you?

53:51.155 --> 53:53.655
Of course...
Definitely.

53:53.765 --> 53:55.305
One shot.

54:10.135 --> 54:11.415
Tomorrow?

54:11.645 --> 54:14.155
District Office documents manager...

54:18.575 --> 54:19.875
<i>[Employee ID, Secretary's Office,
Haewon Group]</i>

54:30.535 --> 54:31.845
Oh!
You scared me.

54:31.865 --> 54:34.265
That's Chun Jae Man's secretary
whom we saw at the hospital, right?

54:34.285 --> 54:35.505
You're really smart at times like this.

54:35.525 --> 54:38.265
How can you go to a hotel
with a woman you've seen once?

54:38.285 --> 54:40.105
What method did you use on her?

54:40.155 --> 54:42.595
I sweat a little
at the health club she goes to,

54:42.615 --> 54:44.885
and she fell for me immediately.

54:45.165 --> 54:48.205
Don't use that sort of tactic.
Use me. Me...

54:48.225 --> 54:50.005
Why abuse your body like that?

54:50.025 --> 54:51.185
Abuse?

54:51.205 --> 54:52.125
Me?

54:52.145 --> 54:55.125
Hey, all my alibis were women.

54:55.145 --> 54:56.945
You're going to continue to be like this
so just stay out of it.

54:56.965 --> 54:57.735
You're just getting in the way.

54:57.755 --> 54:58.845
In the way?

54:58.875 --> 55:00.065
I'm telling you again,

55:00.095 --> 55:02.635
but I can do even worse things.

55:02.915 --> 55:05.465
Well, since you're probably exhausted,
I'll drive.

55:05.485 --> 55:07.115
Ah, that's enough.

55:08.725 --> 55:11.445
I'm going to stick with it to the end.

55:11.485 --> 55:13.415
I said that's enough.

55:14.695 --> 55:16.885
Jong Shik...

55:17.135 --> 55:19.925
Hurry and wake up.
Hmm?

55:21.165 --> 55:25.875
I'm absolutely going to catch
that social disruption City Hunter.

55:27.805 --> 55:30.715
Then, good luck.

55:30.735 --> 55:32.195
Thank you.

55:41.385 --> 55:44.105
I thought you'd be too busy to come.

55:44.835 --> 55:47.675
I hear you're investigating me these days.

55:48.495 --> 55:51.405
I have a lot of ears
at the Public Prosecutor's Office.

55:52.025 --> 55:55.755
What do you have against me?

55:55.775 --> 55:58.155
You did an interview a little while ago,
didn't you?

55:58.195 --> 56:00.655
That a special forces unit
which stole classified military secrets

56:00.705 --> 56:03.485
was shot dead in open waters.

56:04.165 --> 56:08.415
But, the shores off Nampo in North Korea

56:08.435 --> 56:10.855
isn't open waters, is it?

56:11.535 --> 56:14.835
I was already curious
about what happened in 1983,

56:14.855 --> 56:18.045
and your interview came like a blessing.

56:18.715 --> 56:21.735
I will be coming to you
for cooperation with various investigations.

56:21.905 --> 56:23.875
Please be careful getting home.

56:36.105 --> 56:39.295
He's my friend's son, but I have no choice.

56:40.985 --> 56:42.655
Get rid of him.

56:42.825 --> 56:44.435
Yes, Sir.

56:55.095 --> 56:56.555
Yes, this is Prosecutor Kim Young Joo.

56:56.575 --> 56:58.695
<i>This is the officetel* management office.
(*office and apartment building).</i>

56:58.715 --> 57:01.205
<i>A report came in that
there is a gas leak coming from your unit.</i>

57:01.225 --> 57:02.235
Excuse me?

57:02.255 --> 57:04.205
<i>Please come quickly.</i>

57:04.265 --> 57:06.645
I'll be there right away.

57:31.295 --> 57:34.395
I'm sorry.
Only authorized...

58:14.425 --> 58:15.625
Yeah, Soo Young, it's me.

58:15.645 --> 58:18.555
I came to see you, but I can't get in
because I don't have a pass.

58:18.585 --> 58:20.855
Can you come out to the lobby for a minute?

58:21.275 --> 58:25.395
<i>Oh... But the others
have all gone out for a snack.</i>

58:25.415 --> 58:26.465
Then, I'll just leave.

58:26.485 --> 58:27.985
No.

58:28.025 --> 58:30.805
They'll just think I'm in the bathroom.
I'll be right there.

58:30.835 --> 58:32.635
Wait.

58:52.185 --> 58:54.915
<i>[Chairman's Office]</i>

59:24.185 --> 59:29.455
<i>[Classified Document]</i>

59:36.135 --> 59:38.295
Top secret files from October 1983,
on elite soldiers who are missing in action,

59:38.315 --> 59:40.155
are locked until 2030.

59:40.175 --> 59:43.305
Please allow us access to those files.

59:43.345 --> 59:45.785
I think that's what
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo was after.

59:45.815 --> 59:49.455
This cash account is for 500 million won.

59:50.775 --> 59:55.745
And don't ever forget to keep your mouth
shut about this top secret document.

59:55.765 --> 59:57.145
Yes.

59:57.165 --> 59:59.715
Since you work at the
Ministry of Information and Communication,

59:59.735 --> 01:00:01.705
you must know how to keep a secret.

01:00:01.725 --> 01:00:06.415
I know what result awaits me
if I open my mouth.

01:00:06.435 --> 01:00:08.065
Go on.

01:00:11.125 --> 01:00:12.665
Then...

01:00:22.005 --> 01:00:28.875
A document classified until 2030,
who's going to have any interest in it then?

01:00:29.525 --> 01:00:31.895
No one will know if it disappears.

01:00:41.045 --> 01:00:42.605
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:46.335
There should be no problem
disguising it as a suicide.

01:00:46.995 --> 01:00:51.605
That kid Kim Young Joo...
is too impertinent.

01:00:52.035 --> 01:00:55.055
<i>He's already an outcast
at the Public Prosecutor's Office.</i>

01:00:55.075 --> 01:00:59.505
<i>No one will be suspicious
if you make it look like a suicide.</i>

01:00:59.865 --> 01:01:01.285
<i>All right.</i>

01:01:01.325 --> 01:01:06.165
Then I'll be waiting
for tonight's evening news.

01:01:06.615 --> 01:01:08.175
Yeah.

01:01:35.315 --> 01:01:37.475
<i>This is Kim Young Joo's phone.</i>

01:01:37.495 --> 01:01:38.355
Is he not there right now?

01:01:38.395 --> 01:01:40.755
<i>He got a call from the officetel
where he lives about a gas leak.</i>

01:01:40.775 --> 01:01:43.005
The security office contacted him,
so he has gone home.

01:01:43.025 --> 01:01:45.205
<i>He left his phone here.
Who is this?</i>

01:01:45.235 --> 01:01:47.115
Gas leak?

01:02:10.955 --> 01:02:12.175
Yes, is this security?

01:02:12.195 --> 01:02:13.305
<i>Yes.</i>

01:02:13.325 --> 01:02:15.783
I was told earlier
there was a gas leak from my place,

01:02:15.784 --> 01:02:16.945
but there seems to be nothing wrong.

01:02:16.946 --> 01:02:18.195
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

01:02:18.215 --> 01:02:19.565
You called earlier...

01:02:19.585 --> 01:02:21.915
<i>We never called you.</i>

01:02:21.985 --> 01:02:23.415
Excuse me?

01:02:24.955 --> 01:02:26.865
I see.

01:04:26.145 --> 01:04:27.955
Kim Young Joo!
