{\an5}COACH:
Okay, girls,
that's all she wrote for today.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.677
{\an8}Oh, I should probably
inform you girls

00:52.761 --> 00:53.887
{\an8}that come next Monday,

00:53.970 --> 00:57.682
{\an8}each and every one
of you fine young ladies

00:57.766 --> 01:01.478
{\an8}will be making a giant lunge
towards womanhood.

01:01.561 --> 01:02.437
As in "step, lunge, turn"?

01:02.520 --> 01:04.272
{\an8}The time has come

01:04.355 --> 01:05.315
{\an8}for us to watch
a certain movie

01:05.397 --> 01:10.028
{\an8}that I'm sure will
answer all your
burning questions.

01:10.111 --> 01:12.989
Trust me,
no burning questions here.

01:13.072 --> 01:14.157
Report to the gym.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.241
Don't be late.

01:15.325 --> 01:16.201
(<i> gasps</i> )

01:16.284 --> 01:17.994
{\an8}My sister has a friend
who knows a girl

01:18.077 --> 01:21.331
{\an8}who grew underarm hair
from watching the movie.

01:21.414 --> 01:22.499
So, wait-- this movie

01:22.582 --> 01:25.960
{\an1}is going to cover everything
we ever need to know?

01:26.044 --> 01:26.920
Every last detail.

01:27.003 --> 01:28.546
{\an5}I suspect it's
those last details

01:28.630 --> 01:31.174
I'd rather not
know about.

01:31.257 --> 01:33.676
{\an1}Come on, Macie,
it can't be that bad.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.011
(<i> girl giggling</i> )

01:35.094 --> 01:36.095
Oh, Ginger!

01:36.179 --> 01:39.057
Simple, innocent Ginger.

01:39.140 --> 01:39.933
Can't be that bad?

01:40.016 --> 01:41.100
{\an1}I guess you've
never seen

01:41.184 --> 01:43.102
{\an1}one of those movies
before, have you?

01:43.186 --> 01:45.897
I hope you're not
too freaked out by it.

01:45.980 --> 01:46.564
I guess we'll see.

01:46.648 --> 01:49.734
Oh, I'm sure we will.

01:56.616 --> 01:58.159
(<i> boy chewing noisily</i> )

01:58.243 --> 01:59.077
Are you sure you can't smell me?

01:59.160 --> 02:03.164
Because I swear
I'm getting a little gamy.

02:03.248 --> 02:03.998
What do you expect

02:04.082 --> 02:05.708
{\an1}after 15 days
without a bath?

02:05.792 --> 02:09.044
But, Carl, we have
another 92 days to go

02:09.127 --> 02:11.506
before we break
the record.

02:11.589 --> 02:13.758
Hey, what's that smell?

02:13.842 --> 02:14.884
Carl!

02:13.842 --> 02:14.884
{\an1}Hoodsey.

02:14.968 --> 02:16.135
No, it smells sweet.

02:16.219 --> 02:18.513
Bubble gum! Can I have a piece?

02:18.596 --> 02:19.931
What's it worth
to you?

02:20.014 --> 02:21.516
I don't know-- 50 cents?

02:21.599 --> 02:22.642
Don't do it, Carl.

02:22.725 --> 02:23.560
Um, let's see.

02:23.643 --> 02:25.436
How about I trade you
for an upclose look

02:25.520 --> 02:29.315
at that monkey tooth you've
been bragging about all week?

02:29.399 --> 02:32.318
But this is
Mr. Licorice's baby tooth.

02:32.402 --> 02:33.611
It only fell out on Wednesday.

02:33.695 --> 02:37.115
So? This is triple sour.

02:37.198 --> 02:38.491
Deal?

02:39.617 --> 02:42.036
But no keepsies.

02:42.996 --> 02:46.583
I expect that tooth back
by the end of class.

02:46.666 --> 02:49.502
{\an1}Just as I expect
that gum back, Higsby.

02:49.586 --> 02:51.212
{\an1}COACH:
Okay, listen up!

02:51.296 --> 02:52.589
As the new gym teacher,

02:52.672 --> 02:55.592
I'm implementing a few changes
here at Lucky Elementary.

02:55.675 --> 02:56.885
First you will be required

02:56.968 --> 02:58.845
to wear these
standard-issue gym uniforms

02:58.928 --> 03:02.932
that you will take home and have
washed at least once a week.

03:03.016 --> 03:03.933
You will provide your own towel

03:04.017 --> 03:07.270
as I expect you
to take showers

03:07.353 --> 03:10.273
after any and all
physical exercise.

03:10.356 --> 03:14.027
Showers? But, Carl, what
about our world record?

03:14.110 --> 03:18.573
Easy. We'll wear plastic bags
on our feet to keep them dirty.

03:18.656 --> 03:19.782
It will count the same.

03:19.866 --> 03:22.035
(<i> chewing noisily</i> )

03:22.118 --> 03:26.205
Young man, chewing in my gym
is grounds for the shoe box.

{\an1}(<i> gulps</i> )

03:26.289 --> 03:28.708
(<i> gulps</i> )

03:31.628 --> 03:34.839
{\an1}Whoa, Hoods,
check out the prechew.

03:34.923 --> 03:37.425
Now, put your piece in the box.

03:38.384 --> 03:43.306
{\an5}COACH:
And take another piece out
of the box.

03:43.389 --> 03:44.849
Eww!

03:44.933 --> 03:46.601
But that's filthy, Mr. Ward.

03:46.684 --> 03:48.978
You heard me!

03:49.062 --> 03:50.271
Take another piece!

03:50.355 --> 03:50.605
(<i> gasps</i> )

03:50.688 --> 03:52.440
And chew it!

03:52.523 --> 03:54.359
{\an3}Gross!

03:54.984 --> 03:57.487
Now, consider that fair warning

03:57.570 --> 03:59.530
but don't you
try me again.

03:59.614 --> 04:01.991
Sorry, Higsby.

04:02.075 --> 04:02.992
Looks like I'm going

04:03.076 --> 04:04.285
{\an1}to have to keep your
security deposit.

04:04.369 --> 04:07.956
No way! I can't even hear
the word "puberty"

04:08.039 --> 04:10.291
without breaking
into a cold sweat.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.251
You're on your own, you guys.

04:12.335 --> 04:13.544
I'm not watching it.

04:13.628 --> 04:16.589
What if you just close your eyes
during the bad parts?

04:16.673 --> 04:18.048
The sounds of female development

04:18.132 --> 04:20.468
have to be just as horrible
as the sights.

04:20.551 --> 04:23.972
{\an4}But aren't you curious
about what's going on
with our bodies?

04:24.055 --> 04:27.016
There's nothing going on
with my body.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.184
Look! See!

04:28.267 --> 04:32.814
{\an1}But, Macie, puberty is,
like, just around the corner.

04:32.897 --> 04:33.898
(<i> mumbling</i> )

04:33.982 --> 04:38.403
Well, when and if my time comes
to turn that corner,

04:38.486 --> 04:42.323
I'll go on-line
and figure it out anonymously.

04:42.407 --> 04:43.992
Macie, think
of all the things

04:44.075 --> 04:45.618
we'll have to talk about
after this movie.

04:45.702 --> 04:49.914
If you don't see it, you won't
have anything to talk about,

04:49.998 --> 04:51.207
and if you're with us,

04:51.290 --> 04:53.918
then nobody will talk
to us about anything.

04:54.002 --> 04:55.586
{\an3}Oh!

04:55.670 --> 04:56.838
You know what, Macie?

04:56.921 --> 04:59.257
Maybe seeing the movie
isn't that serious.

04:59.340 --> 05:00.466
It's very serious, Ginger.

05:00.550 --> 05:01.884
Missing out on this
is like missing out

05:01.968 --> 05:04.887
on a major part of junior high.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.806
Oh...!

05:08.850 --> 05:11.394
(<i> spraying</i> )

05:11.978 --> 05:13.646
(<i> sniffing</i> )

05:13.730 --> 05:16.065
Now my feet smell like
pine-flavored cheese.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.861
{\an1}Believe me, Jo-Jo
will thank me later.

05:19.944 --> 05:21.571
I hate to break it
to you, Carl,

05:21.654 --> 05:22.780
but my mom is not
your biggest fan.

05:22.864 --> 05:24.907
{\an1}Yeah, I'm an
acquired taste

05:24.991 --> 05:27.035
{\an1}like, uh,
pine-flavored cheese.

05:27.118 --> 05:28.161
Give her time.

05:28.244 --> 05:29.996
{\an1}Just don't let her force you
into taking a bath.

05:30.079 --> 05:31.914
I won't,
but I don't know

05:31.998 --> 05:34.584
about these showers
in gym.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.711
No need to spaz.

05:36.794 --> 05:39.213
{\an1}We'll still break that record
with our feet.

05:39.297 --> 05:42.592
No, it's just... I mean...

05:42.675 --> 05:44.427
I don't know if I believe

05:44.510 --> 05:46.179
in premarital
nudity, okay?

05:46.262 --> 05:48.389
{\an1}Hey, let's use
the monkey tooth

05:48.473 --> 05:50.224
{\an1}and go fake
an extraction

05:50.308 --> 05:51.768
in front of the girls.

05:51.851 --> 05:54.979
{\an1}You know, I might even have a
fake blood pellet lying around.

05:55.063 --> 05:57.648
{\an5}Carl, you have
that glint
in your eye.

05:57.732 --> 05:58.900
What are you up to?

05:58.983 --> 06:00.693
{\an1}Hoods and I
were contemplating

06:00.777 --> 06:03.946
{\an1}our entertainment options
for the evening.

06:04.030 --> 06:06.199
I won't ask.

06:16.375 --> 06:22.048
Okay, Mace, just go in
and ask to be excused.

06:25.426 --> 06:27.136
(<i> gasps</i> ):
I can't do it.

06:27.220 --> 06:31.891
Ginger, you ask
for me, please.

06:32.725 --> 06:33.976
Uh, Ms. Powell.

06:34.060 --> 06:37.396
Hello, Ginger, here to join
the field hockey team?

06:37.480 --> 06:38.231
Uh, not exactly.

06:38.314 --> 06:40.900
I was wondering--
how important is it

06:40.983 --> 06:43.736
that every student sees
the movie on Monday?

06:43.820 --> 06:44.821
{\an1}Very important,
Ginger.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.322
When I was your age,
I was pretty naive

06:46.405 --> 06:50.993
{\an1}but seeing that movie helped
me understand my body

06:51.077 --> 06:54.038
and the ebb and flow
of its hormones.

06:54.122 --> 06:55.081
Oh!

06:55.164 --> 06:57.875
{\an5}I learned that
I may well grow
a moustache one day,

06:57.959 --> 06:58.793
and should that
ever happen,

06:58.876 --> 07:02.004
{\an1}I'm now emotionally prepared
to deal with it,

07:02.088 --> 07:03.506
{\an1}all because
of that film.

07:03.589 --> 07:05.007
Oh, that's...
great

07:05.091 --> 07:07.051
but, you see,
I'm asking

07:07.135 --> 07:08.010
because, um,
a friend of mine

07:08.094 --> 07:09.220
is kind of
squeamish.

07:09.303 --> 07:11.848
Well, your "friend"
had better toughen up.

07:11.931 --> 07:15.184
Viewing this movie is
mandatory for all students

07:15.268 --> 07:17.270
{\an1}as part of the
health curriculum.

07:17.353 --> 07:21.023
{\an1}You don't see it,
you don't graduate.

07:21.107 --> 07:22.150
Don't graduate?

07:22.233 --> 07:25.736
{\an4}POWELL:
And your "friend" may
still get the moustache.

07:25.820 --> 07:26.195
{\an1}Then what?

07:26.279 --> 07:28.156
See you on Monday.

07:28.239 --> 07:31.200
How many times do you think
I can repeat eighth grade

07:31.284 --> 07:32.660
before it'll get boring?

07:36.831 --> 07:41.002
(<i> sounds echoing slowly</i>

Let me see something!

08:17.622 --> 08:25.379
(<i> kids shouting, playing</i>
<i>in background</i> )

08:25.463 --> 08:27.256
Nice ambush work
there, Foutley.

08:27.340 --> 08:30.259
{\an1}It's an honor to be
in your service, General.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.599

08:36.682 --> 08:38.476
This rots big-time.

(<i> clarinets squealing</i>

08:43.438 --> 08:46.984
{\an5}I just can't wait
for that health
class movie.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.153
I hear they use
time-lapse photography

08:49.237 --> 08:50.613
to show a girl
"fill out,"

08:50.696 --> 08:52.156
if you know
what I mean.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.366
No kidding?

08:53.449 --> 08:54.533
Looking forward
to it.

08:54.617 --> 08:56.619
{\an1}Funny, that's what
Holly Smith said

08:56.702 --> 08:57.912
{\an1}about the movie
last year

08:57.995 --> 09:01.290
{\an1}but then she saw it, freaked,
and joined a convent.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.667
But you might
be different.

09:02.750 --> 09:06.629
{\an1}With any luck, you'll learn
a thing or two about growing up.

09:06.712 --> 09:07.338
Listen, Miranda!

09:07.421 --> 09:08.548
I'll be the one to decide

09:08.631 --> 09:10.591
if I'm going to learn anything
about growing up!

09:10.675 --> 09:15.638
And you keep playing a C-sharp
instead of a B-flat right there

09:15.721 --> 09:18.349
and it's throwing me off!

09:26.190 --> 09:28.234
WARD:
Bishop,

09:28.317 --> 09:29.986
I thought I made the rules
perfectly clear.

09:30.069 --> 09:34.824
Oh. Uh... my mom just cleaned
my uniform yesterday.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.158
Honest.

09:36.242 --> 09:37.451
I'm referring
to rule number seven:

09:37.535 --> 09:41.622
All students will be required to
shower after physical exercise.

09:41.706 --> 09:44.709
Oh... I wasn't
that physical, really.

09:44.792 --> 09:46.168
Hardly broke a sweat.

09:46.252 --> 09:47.545
I just run
a little clammy, yeah.

09:47.628 --> 09:51.007
Besides, I have a highly
contagious skin disease

09:51.090 --> 09:52.925
that could wash off
in the shower

09:53.009 --> 09:54.218
and spread to everybody else.

09:54.302 --> 09:56.846
Then I suggest you bring
a note from your doctor

09:56.929 --> 09:58.639
{\an1}so that I can
properly excuse you.

09:58.723 --> 09:59.390
{\an1}Otherwise it's
a failing grade.

09:59.473 --> 10:01.976

out there, Foutley.

10:02.059 --> 10:04.895
It was an inspired battle,
General.

10:06.314 --> 10:06.897
See?

10:06.981 --> 10:08.316
{\an1}these bags work
like a charm.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.109
{\an1}Even makes them
sweat better.

10:10.192 --> 10:13.362
{\an5}There's a glob of
my tuna fish salad
still in there.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.280
Why didn't you shower?

10:14.363 --> 10:17.283
Oh. Uh... ran out of time.

10:17.366 --> 10:20.661
Mr. Ward was giving me,
uh, skiing tips.

10:20.745 --> 10:21.829
You don't ski.

10:21.912 --> 10:23.873
Well, maybe I don't have
enough tips yet, Carl.

10:23.956 --> 10:27.043
{\an3}Uh, doy!

10:30.338 --> 10:33.466
(<i> breathing heavily</i> )

10:37.136 --> 10:39.889
Miranda just told me
the funniest story

10:39.972 --> 10:41.682
about band practice
today.

10:41.766 --> 10:43.142
It looks
like Lightfoot

10:43.225 --> 10:44.518
{\an1}is a lightweight
on all counts.

10:44.602 --> 10:47.521
{\an1}If Macie doesn't want
to see the movie,

10:47.605 --> 10:49.357
it doesn't mean
that she's a...

10:49.440 --> 10:51.567
Oh, but it does,
Ginger.

10:51.650 --> 10:54.653
That's exactly
what it means.

10:54.737 --> 10:55.571

Bye, Mace.

10:59.450 --> 11:00.409
Bye.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.535
Call me later.

11:01.619 --> 11:04.330
Uh, can I give you girls
a little free advice?

11:04.413 --> 11:05.331
Sometimes you have
to move on

11:05.414 --> 11:06.791
and leave
friends behind

11:06.874 --> 11:10.669
{\an1}if you're ever going to get
anywhere in life, mm-hmm.

11:11.337 --> 11:14.632
(<i> engine revs</i> )

11:14.715 --> 11:17.426
I told you she would
kick us off the bus

11:17.510 --> 11:18.844
if we got too ripe.

11:18.928 --> 11:19.762
That's okay.

11:19.845 --> 11:20.596
It gives us a chance
to slow down

11:20.679 --> 11:23.849
and reflect on the
highlights of our day.

11:24.600 --> 11:28.938
Like when I beaned
Gripling and Higsby

11:29.021 --> 11:30.106
with the same ball.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.483
That game was a little
too violent for me.

11:32.566 --> 11:35.820
{\an1}And thanks for helping me out
of prison, by the way.

11:35.903 --> 11:39.240
I was avenging your
imprisonment, Hoods.

11:39.323 --> 11:42.368
It's a dumb game.

11:42.451 --> 11:43.327
Are you nuts?!

11:43.411 --> 11:44.370
That was the coolest.

11:44.453 --> 11:46.080
Mr. Ward is showing
some real promise

11:46.163 --> 11:48.332
for our future.

11:48.416 --> 11:52.211
You just don't get it,
Carl, do you?

11:52.294 --> 11:53.003
I'm going in.

11:53.087 --> 11:55.631
Hey, why don't you
sleep over tonight?

11:55.714 --> 11:58.384
{\an1}We can try to bottle
our foot stink.

11:58.467 --> 11:59.468
No, thanks.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.054
I'm, uh... going to
hang out with my dad.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.473
{\an3}See you.

12:04.765 --> 12:09.145
But you never hang out
with your dad.

12:11.814 --> 12:13.190
{\an1}No double-
dipping, Carl!

12:13.274 --> 12:18.320
Hey, I don't have the right
balance of cheese to pickle.

12:18.404 --> 12:19.822
Ah, this brings me back

12:19.905 --> 12:21.323
to my single days
back in Boston.

12:21.407 --> 12:24.160
My best friend,
Nancy, and I

12:24.243 --> 12:25.453
lived in
an apartment

12:25.536 --> 12:26.996
with a tub
in the kitchen.

12:27.079 --> 12:30.750
Do we have any more
cling peaches?

12:30.833 --> 12:33.794

Behind
the raisin log!

12:33.878 --> 12:34.670

12:34.753 --> 12:35.880
{\an4}What ever
happened
to Nancy?

12:35.963 --> 12:38.966
{\an5}Ah, I guess
we sort of went
our separate ways.

12:39.049 --> 12:40.718
You were best friends.

12:40.801 --> 12:42.094
Oh, we were!

12:42.178 --> 12:43.387
None better.

12:43.471 --> 12:45.389
{\an5}But that's the
way life works,
you know.

12:45.473 --> 12:48.142
Circumstances change
and people move on.

12:48.225 --> 12:48.851
When I hear
from Nance--

12:48.934 --> 12:51.854
{\an1}ha!-- it's just
like the old days.

12:51.937 --> 12:53.189
Laughing it up.

12:53.272 --> 12:56.317
Except now we're a little older
and a little wider.

12:56.400 --> 13:00.196
I can't imagine life
without Macie or Dodie.

13:00.279 --> 13:01.572
Ginge, there's no guarantee

13:01.655 --> 13:04.450
you kids won't go
your own separate ways

13:04.533 --> 13:05.743
so there's no sense
worrying about it.

13:05.826 --> 13:09.455
{\an5}For now, act like
your friendship
is forever

13:09.538 --> 13:12.082
and it just might
turn out that way.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.375
(<i> slurping</i>

13:13.459 --> 13:16.587

still being friends

13:30.518 --> 13:32.269
Is it Carl Foutley?

13:32.353 --> 13:34.813
No! I've just been
thinking a lot

13:34.897 --> 13:36.065
about Mary Todd Lincoln

13:36.148 --> 13:39.151
and I've been feeling
really bad for her.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.320
Robert Joseph,
the woman was mad.

13:41.403 --> 13:42.363
How do you know?

13:42.446 --> 13:44.240
Maybe she had no one to talk to.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.951
Maybe she didn't even want to go
to that stupid play.

13:47.034 --> 13:52.248
A tragic possibility, but
that is not what's bothering you

13:52.331 --> 13:52.665
and I know it.

13:52.748 --> 13:53.290
Now, out with it.

13:55.668 --> 14:00.130
Well, all the boys have to
take showers in gym class

14:00.214 --> 14:02.091
but I'm too embarrassed.

14:02.174 --> 14:02.925
{\an1}I can't talk
to Carl about it

14:03.008 --> 14:05.427
{\an1}because he doesn't think
it's a big deal.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.763
Well, of course <i> he</i> doesn't.

14:07.846 --> 14:10.349
The child's a budding
exhibitionist.

14:10.432 --> 14:11.141
It's perfectly natural

14:11.225 --> 14:13.185
to be embarrassed
of your naked self.

14:13.269 --> 14:14.311
Look at your father!

We've been
married 22 years

in the closet.

{\an5}You don't have
to take your
clothes off,

14:21.277 --> 14:25.864
and if that's a problem with
your teacher, I'll speak to him.

14:25.948 --> 14:28.158
Remember, Robert,
modesty is good.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.786
It's one thing that
separates us humans

14:30.869 --> 14:33.998

Hey, you guys.

We didn't,
but we do now.

have been
through a lot

15:06.488 --> 15:08.407
{\an1}since kindergarten,
good and bad.

15:08.490 --> 15:09.491
We did stuff
together.

I have a police record
to remind me of that, Ginger.

15:13.746 --> 15:14.371
{\an3}Exactly.

15:14.455 --> 15:15.164
You stuck
by my side

15:15.247 --> 15:16.832
when I was scared
and needed support.

15:16.915 --> 15:20.127
I couldn't have done
that without you.

It's my turn to be
here for you.

15:21.170 --> 15:24.840
Macie, that movie is
too important a milestone

15:24.923 --> 15:28.052
for the three of us
not to reach together.

15:28.135 --> 15:30.888
{\an5}But I really don't think
I'm ready.

15:30.971 --> 15:31.930
Maybe you're not,

15:32.014 --> 15:34.141
but let us at least try
to get you ready.

15:34.224 --> 15:37.269
{\an1}We can use the entire
weekend to prepare.

15:37.353 --> 15:40.689
Okay, but I'm not
promising anything.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.066
You'll be fine.

15:42.149 --> 15:46.195

through Mrs. Foutley's
medical books

16:18.477 --> 16:20.062
{\an1}I was wondering,
Mrs. Foutley.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.021
Would it be illegal

16:21.105 --> 16:23.357
{\an1}for a school to take
a nurse's note

16:23.440 --> 16:25.109
{\an1}instead of
a doctor's note?

16:25.192 --> 16:27.194
I'm not sure. Why?

16:27.277 --> 16:28.570

17:08.402 --> 17:09.486
No offense,
Mrs. Foutley,

18:52.130 --> 18:53.549
Okay, but
in my outfit,

18:53.632 --> 18:55.509
we call that
wimping out.

18:55.592 --> 18:57.386
Higsby, pick
your team!

18:57.469 --> 18:58.720
Yippee!

18:58.804 --> 19:01.056
Okay!

19:02.724 --> 19:05.227
Uh, Gripling.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.186
{\an3}Foutley.

19:06.270 --> 19:07.229

19:07.312 --> 19:08.063

FILM NARRATOR:
This is

19:09.481 --> 19:12.067
just the beginning
of a marvelous transformation

19:12.150 --> 19:15.279
that's starting to take place
in your body.

19:15.362 --> 19:17.155
Right now, a battery of hormones

19:17.239 --> 19:19.157
is raging through
your bloodstream

19:19.241 --> 19:20.993
shouting, "Wake up, world,
Judy's here!"

19:21.076 --> 19:24.163
Soon you'll see hair
in new places

19:24.246 --> 19:29.376
and along with it,
some fascinating new smells.

19:29.459 --> 19:30.586
Don't worry.

19:30.669 --> 19:34.089
A little deodorant
will take care of that.

19:34.173 --> 19:35.757
You could also find yourself

19:35.841 --> 19:37.885
facing down
a serious case of acne

19:37.968 --> 19:40.679
or wondering why
your clothes are getting

19:40.762 --> 19:41.430
a little snug in places.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.015
And then,
when you least expect it,

19:43.098 --> 19:45.142
a certain monthly visitor
will arrive,

19:45.225 --> 19:49.438
delivering you
to the threshold of womanhood.

19:49.521 --> 19:51.773
But there is a greater gift
to womanhood.

19:51.857 --> 19:55.652
Do you know what that is, Judy?

19:56.028 --> 19:58.864
(<i> baby crying on film</i> )

19:58.947 --> 20:03.201
(<i> Courtney retching</i> )

20:03.285 --> 20:04.202
My shoes!

20:04.286 --> 20:05.913
I wasn't prepared
for that.

20:05.996 --> 20:07.205
Courtney...

20:07.289 --> 20:08.707
Don't make a scene!

20:08.790 --> 20:09.458
Make a scene?!

20:09.541 --> 20:11.627
These are only
my favorite shoes!

20:11.710 --> 20:14.880
{\an1}Why didn't you
throw up on hers?

20:15.422 --> 20:17.299
{\an1}GINGER:
Mace, it's me.

20:17.382 --> 20:18.258
Are you okay?

20:18.342 --> 20:19.343
Not really.

20:19.426 --> 20:21.386
I just can't handle
all that stuff.

20:21.470 --> 20:23.639
But I thought
you were doing fine.

20:23.722 --> 20:25.849
You got through
most of the movie.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.643
Actually, I took
your advice

20:27.726 --> 20:28.727
and closed my eyes a lot.

20:28.810 --> 20:32.356
I'll forever be haunted
by the sounds of cramping.

20:32.439 --> 20:36.026
I'm sorry if Dodie and I
pushed you into this.

20:36.109 --> 20:36.985
I was afraid

20:37.069 --> 20:39.196
that if we didn't
do this together,

20:39.279 --> 20:40.530
we'd grow apart.

20:40.614 --> 20:41.740
I was, too, Ginger.

20:41.823 --> 20:45.160
That's why I forced myself
to come today.

20:45.243 --> 20:46.995
But now I'm in here hiding.

20:47.079 --> 20:50.582
Yeah, but you saw the movie,
and that's what counts.

20:50.666 --> 20:51.708
So what if we both
missed the end?

20:51.792 --> 20:57.297
I'm sure Dodie will fill us in
on all the details later.

20:59.967 --> 21:00.592
Thank you, Ginger.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.844
Hey, BFFs, remember?

21:02.928 --> 21:04.638
(<i> both laugh</i> )

21:04.721 --> 21:06.765
There you are!

21:06.848 --> 21:09.226
{\an1}Oh, you will <i> not</i> believe
what you missed,

21:09.309 --> 21:10.894
besides Miranda
freaking out

21:10.978 --> 21:12.688
over the ruined
platforms,

21:12.771 --> 21:13.230
which was great.

21:13.313 --> 21:15.732
Courtney's
chin quivered!

21:15.816 --> 21:17.651
{\an4}But during
the childbirth
scene,

21:17.734 --> 21:18.235
{\an1}which was
so gross,

21:18.318 --> 21:19.194
{\an1}the projector
caught fire

21:19.278 --> 21:23.031
{\an5}and Ms. Powell
used Courtney's
cashmere poncho

21:23.115 --> 21:24.032
to smother
the flames!

21:24.116 --> 21:27.369
Now you should see
who's freaking out.

21:31.957 --> 21:34.042
HOODSEY:
Have to admit, Carl,

21:34.126 --> 21:35.460
it felt pretty good

21:35.544 --> 21:36.878
sending Higsby's
sorry butt

21:36.962 --> 21:39.715
to the back
of the pack.

21:39.798 --> 21:40.882
(<i> whimpers</i> )

21:40.966 --> 21:42.426
You coming, Hoods?

21:42.509 --> 21:43.552
Could you turn
around?

21:43.635 --> 21:44.970
I'm kind of
embarrassed.

21:45.053 --> 21:46.346
It's just us guys.

21:46.430 --> 21:47.597
Don't be embarrassed.

21:47.681 --> 21:50.559
It's not like you
have webbed toes.

21:50.642 --> 21:51.977
{\an3}I wish!

21:52.060 --> 21:55.188
Carl, I don't want
to dress in a closet

21:55.272 --> 21:58.066
for the rest of my life.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.491
(<i> sniffing</i> )

22:06.575 --> 22:07.993
(<i> moaning</i> )

22:08.076 --> 22:12.164
You smell like monkey cack!

22:12.247 --> 22:13.373
Eww!

22:13.457 --> 22:14.458
Revolting!

22:14.541 --> 22:16.543
(<i> all groaning</i> )

22:16.626 --> 22:18.503
(<i> laughs</i> )

22:18.587 --> 22:21.465
{\an1}How completely
excellent!

22:21.548 --> 22:24.843
You can say that
again.

22:30.098 --> 22:33.226
You know, this being
naked stuff in public

22:33.310 --> 22:34.853
{\an1}is actually
kind of liberating.

22:34.936 --> 22:37.064
(<i> Hoodsey laughs</i> )

22:37.147 --> 22:39.775
CARL:
We'll have to do it more often.

22:39.858 --> 22:40.817
HOODSEY:
You know what?

22:40.901 --> 22:43.070
If I had webbed toes,

22:43.153 --> 22:47.324
I would totally wear sandals
all the time.

of your naked self.
