00:21.302 --> 00:22.068
Don't you guys wanna know

00:22.102 --> 00:23.235
What that is?

00:23.270 --> 00:24.137
Is it a transporter

00:24.172 --> 00:24.772
From the future

00:24.806 --> 00:25.305
That can beam you

00:25.340 --> 00:26.206
To another table,

00:26.240 --> 00:26.805
'Cause if it is,

00:26.840 --> 00:29.275
What button do I push?

00:29.309 --> 00:31.079
That's so hurtful.

00:31.080 --> 00:31.445
You know,

00:31.479 --> 00:32.179
You don't always have to be

00:32.213 --> 00:33.145
Mean to everyone.

00:33.179 --> 00:34.412
See, Tori's interested

00:34.446 --> 00:35.847
In my device.

00:35.881 --> 00:38.482
I'm really not.

00:38.517 --> 00:39.783
Aw, c'mon little Red,

00:39.817 --> 00:42.522
Tell us about your doo-Hickey.

00:42.556 --> 00:44.222
Okay, it's called:

00:44.257 --> 00:45.724
The snowbee.

00:45.759 --> 00:58.003
Watch.

00:58.038 --> 00:59.840
It makes pretend snow.

00:59.874 --> 01:01.441
I see that.

01:01.475 --> 01:03.509
It's all over my tostada.

01:03.543 --> 01:04.476
And my pizza.

01:04.510 --> 01:05.977
Well, do not eat it.

01:06.012 --> 01:07.145
Why?

01:07.180 --> 01:07.846
'Cause it says

01:07.880 --> 01:09.213
The fake snow is toxic

01:09.248 --> 01:09.914
And can cause

01:09.948 --> 01:14.884
Abdominal bleeding.

01:14.918 --> 01:15.685
So what made you

01:15.719 --> 01:16.252
Buy a machine

01:16.286 --> 01:19.989
That poisons people's lunches?

01:20.023 --> 01:21.589
This catalog.

01:21.624 --> 01:22.590
Sky store?

01:22.624 --> 01:23.057
Yeah.

01:23.092 --> 01:24.192
I went to visit my uncle

01:24.226 --> 01:24.992
And uncle this weekend

01:25.026 --> 01:26.259
In San Francisco,

01:26.293 --> 01:27.893
And they had these on the plane.

01:27.928 --> 01:29.228
It's like filled with all kinds

01:29.262 --> 01:31.295
Of cool stuff you can buy.

01:31.330 --> 01:32.430
Oh, like this:

01:32.464 --> 01:33.532
A tree face.

01:33.566 --> 01:34.567
You put it on your tree

01:34.601 --> 01:37.703
To give it a face.

01:37.738 --> 01:38.404
What if you don't have

01:38.438 --> 01:38.971
A tree?

01:39.006 --> 01:43.477
It also works on bushes.

01:43.511 --> 01:45.580
Unbelievable.

01:45.614 --> 01:46.715
You guys have no idea

01:46.749 --> 01:48.283
How upset I am about...

01:48.317 --> 01:49.851
It snowed?

01:49.885 --> 01:52.220
In los angeles?

01:52.254 --> 01:52.820
I told you

01:52.855 --> 01:54.288
Global warming was bogus.

01:54.323 --> 01:55.890
Stop watching fox news.

01:55.924 --> 01:58.658
No, it's fair and balanced.

01:58.693 --> 01:59.559
Dude...

01:59.593 --> 02:00.527
It's not real snow.

02:00.561 --> 02:03.362
But you can eat it.

02:03.396 --> 02:04.830
I don't wanna eat anything.

02:04.864 --> 02:06.164
What are you all upset about?

02:06.199 --> 02:07.899
This time?

02:07.934 --> 02:08.866
The seniors,

02:08.901 --> 02:10.235
The ones who run the slap...

02:10.269 --> 02:11.202
Dotcom?

02:11.236 --> 02:12.269
No, dot gov.

02:12.304 --> 02:14.338
Yes, dotcom.

02:14.373 --> 02:15.974
They wanna cancel my blog.

02:16.008 --> 02:16.608
Why?

02:16.642 --> 02:19.178
Oh wait, I don't care.

02:19.212 --> 02:20.012
Why?

02:20.046 --> 02:21.280
'Cause it's boring.

02:21.814 --> 02:23.816
It is not bor...

02:23.850 --> 02:24.449
Do you guys think

02:24.484 --> 02:25.284
That my blog on the slap

02:25.318 --> 02:27.686
Is boring?

02:27.720 --> 02:28.921
Hey look, it's that guy

02:28.955 --> 02:30.455
Over there.

02:30.490 --> 02:32.157
It is that guy.

02:32.191 --> 02:37.228
Wait up, guy.

02:37.262 --> 02:41.799
There's no guy.

02:41.833 --> 02:42.299
I'm sorry

02:42.334 --> 02:43.800
They wanna cancel your blog.

02:43.835 --> 02:45.235
I just don't understand why.

02:45.269 --> 02:46.102
Well, what kind of things

02:46.137 --> 02:47.270
Do you report on?

02:47.304 --> 02:49.038
You know, school news.

02:49.072 --> 02:50.539
Like last week, I did a report

02:50.574 --> 02:52.074
About the library being painted.

02:52.108 --> 02:54.609
Borrrr-Riiiing.

02:54.644 --> 02:55.477
What else?

02:55.511 --> 02:56.611
I did a piece

02:56.646 --> 02:57.646
About principal eikner's

02:57.681 --> 02:59.315
New office makeover.

03:02.118 --> 03:03.986
Oh, I did a three-Part series

03:04.020 --> 03:05.221
On carpooling.

03:05.255 --> 03:06.188
Which was three parts

03:06.223 --> 03:08.024
Too many.

03:08.058 --> 03:08.758
Look, if you wanna

03:08.792 --> 03:09.459
Save your blog,

03:09.493 --> 03:10.160
Why don't you just make it

03:10.194 --> 03:11.228
About the students here?

03:11.262 --> 03:11.962
You know, like all the stuff

03:11.996 --> 03:13.830
That goes on in their lives.

03:13.865 --> 03:14.865
You think?

03:14.899 --> 03:16.166
Sure.

03:16.201 --> 03:18.168
Okay, I could try that.

03:18.203 --> 03:20.304
Good.

03:20.338 --> 03:21.406
Oh, and...

03:21.440 --> 03:22.340
Don't eat the snow unless you

03:22.374 --> 03:23.775
Wanna bleed internally.

03:23.809 --> 03:26.010
Okay.

03:26.044 --> 03:27.078
She's so cute.

03:27.112 --> 03:28.546
Girl like that wants a man,

03:28.581 --> 03:29.614
Not a boy.

03:29.615 --> 03:32.984
I'll get there.

04:39.385 --> 04:40.185
I thought you were taking me

04:40.219 --> 04:41.719
To inside out burger.

04:41.754 --> 04:42.620
We'll eat later.

04:42.654 --> 04:43.354
I wanna show you the footage

04:43.388 --> 04:44.755
I shot for my blog.

04:44.790 --> 04:45.756
And why would I care

04:45.791 --> 04:46.623
About that?

04:46.658 --> 04:47.424
'Cause if this

04:47.459 --> 04:48.225
Interview's any good,

04:48.260 --> 04:49.327
It might convince the seniors

04:49.361 --> 04:50.595
To let me keep doing my blog

04:50.629 --> 04:51.629
On the Slap.

04:51.663 --> 04:52.363
Man, why don't you

04:52.397 --> 04:54.064
Just rub my back?

04:54.099 --> 04:54.731
Just watch.

04:54.766 --> 04:56.533
This is quality stuff.

04:56.568 --> 04:58.568
Hello.

04:58.569 --> 04:59.236
Hi.

04:59.270 --> 05:01.371
Now, your name is...

05:01.406 --> 05:03.974
Sinjin van Cleef.

05:04.008 --> 05:05.542
Now Sinjin, I understand

05:05.576 --> 05:07.343
That you collect something.

05:07.378 --> 05:12.816
Yes.

05:12.851 --> 05:14.085
What do you collect?

05:18.290 --> 05:19.824
I collect these.

05:19.858 --> 05:21.626
And those are...

05:21.660 --> 05:23.461
Teeth, from the relatives

05:23.495 --> 05:25.330
Of past presidents.

05:26.532 --> 05:27.699
That's creepy, man.

05:27.733 --> 05:28.967
Shush.

05:29.001 --> 05:29.634
So tell us about

05:29.668 --> 05:31.002
Some of your teeth.

05:31.036 --> 05:31.970
This tooth came

05:32.004 --> 05:33.204
From the mouth of a cousin

05:33.238 --> 05:35.172
Of Ronald Reagan.

05:37.108 --> 05:39.010
This tooth is a molar

05:39.044 --> 05:39.844
That came from the mouth

05:39.878 --> 05:42.046
Of Jimmy Carter's brother Billy.

05:42.080 --> 05:45.149
Wow, it's so yellow.

05:45.183 --> 05:46.583
I know.

05:47.786 --> 05:48.619
What?

05:48.653 --> 05:49.420
Look, you see Tori

05:49.454 --> 05:50.421
In the background?

05:50.455 --> 05:51.155
You're supposed to be

05:51.189 --> 05:52.156
Focusing on my interview

05:52.190 --> 05:53.057
With Sinjin.

05:53.091 --> 05:55.093
Shut up, ding bat.

05:55.127 --> 05:56.294
Rewind the video,

05:56.328 --> 05:57.262
Kill the volume,

05:57.296 --> 05:58.496
Zoom in on Tori

05:58.531 --> 06:07.372
And play it again.

06:07.406 --> 06:11.076
Yeah, now watch her, watch her.

06:11.110 --> 06:13.244
Ha, she's squeezin' on a pimple.

06:13.279 --> 06:15.312
Ha, ha, ha, a zit.

06:15.347 --> 06:16.480
So?

06:16.515 --> 06:17.548
Dude.

06:17.583 --> 06:18.416
That's the kind of funk

06:18.450 --> 06:20.151
America wants to see.

06:20.719 --> 06:23.088
People caught on video.

06:23.122 --> 06:24.122
Put that on your stupid blog

06:24.156 --> 06:27.025
If you want it to be popular.

06:27.060 --> 06:28.260
Tori squeezing a pimple?

06:28.294 --> 06:29.427
That's just mean.

06:29.462 --> 06:31.063
It's news, man.

06:31.097 --> 06:31.830
Come on Rob,

06:31.864 --> 06:32.864
You wanna be a loser

06:32.899 --> 06:35.200
The rest of your life?

06:35.235 --> 06:37.169
I'm not a loser now.

06:37.203 --> 06:41.941
Yeah. What was I thinking?

06:50.517 --> 06:52.318
Okay, now watch,

06:52.353 --> 06:53.286
And you'll see Tori

06:53.320 --> 06:55.221
Reach for her pimple.

06:55.255 --> 06:58.858
Wait for it, and there it is:

06:58.892 --> 07:00.359
The squeezing.

07:02.863 --> 07:04.831
So gross.

07:04.865 --> 07:06.032
Beck, wait, wait, wait...

07:06.066 --> 07:06.632
Wait up!

07:06.667 --> 07:07.900
Oh, okay, all right,

07:07.935 --> 07:08.534
Ya caught me.

07:08.568 --> 07:09.368
What?

07:09.402 --> 07:11.403
I wanna show you what I got.

07:11.437 --> 07:16.441
Sure.

07:16.475 --> 07:20.678
Okay, now, walk towards me.

07:20.712 --> 07:24.282
Closer, closer.

07:24.317 --> 07:26.551
Step away.

07:26.585 --> 07:27.352
You are too close

07:27.386 --> 07:29.587
To this person.

07:29.622 --> 07:31.523
The police are on their way.

07:31.557 --> 07:33.658
I didn't do anything.

07:33.693 --> 07:34.926
Would ya turn that off?

07:34.961 --> 07:36.328
Move back.

07:36.362 --> 07:37.029
It's the world's

07:37.063 --> 07:40.699
Best alarm necklace.

07:40.733 --> 07:42.734
Oh, and look,

07:42.769 --> 07:44.570
The world's brightest key chain.

07:44.604 --> 07:46.505
Yea, okay!

07:46.539 --> 07:47.272
All right, that's bright.

07:47.306 --> 07:48.841
You can turn that off now.

07:48.875 --> 07:49.842
Too bright?

07:49.876 --> 07:52.344
No, I loved that.

07:52.378 --> 07:53.178
You think

07:53.212 --> 07:55.847
Maybe you're buying, you know,

07:55.882 --> 07:57.916
Too many things from sky store?

07:57.950 --> 08:00.152
No.

08:00.186 --> 08:01.219
Oh, hey...

08:01.254 --> 08:01.820
Can I borrow some money

08:01.854 --> 08:02.921
For lunch?

08:02.955 --> 08:04.555
Yeah, how much?

08:04.590 --> 08:07.425
49.95 plus shipping?

08:08.460 --> 08:09.059
No, I don't think

08:09.094 --> 08:11.229
It's going to rain.

08:12.263 --> 08:12.996
Hey, Robbie!

08:13.697 --> 08:14.797
Oh, hi!

08:14.832 --> 08:15.865
TheSlap.com.

08:15.899 --> 08:16.899
That thing you did on Tori

08:16.934 --> 08:18.268
Was hilarious.

08:18.302 --> 08:19.536
You liked my pimple piece?

08:19.570 --> 08:20.337
Awesome.

08:20.371 --> 08:21.004
Rocked.

08:21.038 --> 08:22.939
Thanks.

08:22.973 --> 08:24.307
Oh, hey, funny stuff

08:24.342 --> 08:25.341
On the slap.

08:25.376 --> 08:26.242
You liked it?

08:26.277 --> 08:28.711
Loved.

08:30.347 --> 08:31.647
Hey, Shapiro!

08:31.682 --> 08:32.948
Over here.

08:32.982 --> 08:34.683
Please don't embarrass me.

08:34.717 --> 08:35.518
You're the embarrassment

08:35.553 --> 08:38.020
In our relationship.

08:38.054 --> 08:38.822
Hi, you guys.

08:38.856 --> 08:40.023
Listen, I put a new piece up

08:40.058 --> 08:41.191
On the slap last night...

08:41.225 --> 08:41.991
Robbie.

08:42.025 --> 08:43.025
We're not kicking you

08:43.061 --> 08:43.861
Off the Slap.

08:43.895 --> 08:44.695
You're not?

08:44.729 --> 08:45.996
Dude, that piece you posted

08:46.031 --> 08:47.064
About Tori's pimple...

08:47.099 --> 08:48.999
My pimple post?

08:49.034 --> 08:50.835
Tons of views so far.

08:50.869 --> 08:51.669
Tons?

08:51.704 --> 08:53.171
It's trending.

08:53.205 --> 08:54.238
For real?

08:54.273 --> 08:55.172
Yeah.

08:55.207 --> 08:55.873
You keep posting stuff

08:55.908 --> 08:56.440
Like that,

08:56.475 --> 08:57.241
You can be on the slap

08:57.275 --> 08:58.542
As much as you want.

08:59.444 --> 09:00.778
And if you need any help,

09:00.812 --> 09:01.679
We'll let you boss

09:01.713 --> 09:02.880
Around the ninth graders.

09:02.914 --> 09:05.049
The slap apprentices?

09:05.084 --> 09:05.917
Whatever ya need.

09:05.951 --> 09:06.985
Great work, Rob.

09:07.019 --> 09:09.520
Keep it hot.

09:09.554 --> 09:10.588
I'm a hit.

09:12.323 --> 09:13.490
Robbie.

09:13.524 --> 09:18.028
You're about to get hit.

09:20.031 --> 09:21.032
Hey, ya Tori.

09:21.066 --> 09:23.001
How are things?

09:23.035 --> 09:23.801
I see you're still

09:23.836 --> 09:25.837
Rockin' that chin zit.

09:25.871 --> 09:28.373
You hit me, I'll sue.

09:28.407 --> 09:29.441
How could you post that video

09:29.475 --> 09:31.142
Of me squeezing my pimple?

09:31.177 --> 09:32.177
You told me to make my blog

09:32.211 --> 09:33.478
About the students,

09:33.513 --> 09:34.146
The stuff that goes on

09:34.180 --> 09:35.280
In their lives.

09:35.314 --> 09:36.114
Yeah, not the stuff

09:36.148 --> 09:38.283
That grows on my face.

09:38.317 --> 09:41.086
But it's really popular.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.087
I told you to do stories

09:42.121 --> 09:43.188
About what's going on

09:43.222 --> 09:43.955
In students' lives,

09:43.989 --> 09:44.689
Not to embarrass

09:44.723 --> 09:46.290
And degrade people.

09:46.325 --> 09:47.558
I mean, seriously,

09:47.592 --> 09:48.225
Is being popular

09:48.260 --> 09:51.728
That important to you?

09:51.763 --> 09:53.630
Welcome to...

09:53.664 --> 09:55.165

10:04.242 --> 10:06.243
Oh, my God!

10:06.278 --> 10:08.012
Coming up on Robarazzi,

10:08.046 --> 10:09.414
Tori Vega's pimple:

10:09.448 --> 10:13.452
Shrinking or growing?

10:13.486 --> 10:15.053
Don't touch it.

10:15.088 --> 10:17.121
Also, does Andre Harris

10:17.156 --> 10:19.857
Have a ketchup problem?

10:21.326 --> 10:22.559
Does Sinjin van Cleef

10:22.593 --> 10:25.162
Steal famous teeth?

10:25.196 --> 10:26.596
Probably.

10:26.630 --> 10:27.597
Is it splitsville

10:27.631 --> 10:30.333
For Beck and Jade?

10:30.367 --> 10:33.736
All this, and tons more on...

10:33.770 --> 10:37.240
Starring Robbie Shapiro.

10:37.274 --> 10:38.174
He's a dead man.

10:38.208 --> 10:38.874
Beck and I aren't

10:38.909 --> 10:39.808
Splitting up.

10:39.843 --> 10:40.343
Well...

10:40.377 --> 10:40.810
Dude...

10:40.844 --> 10:41.644
Kidding.

10:41.679 --> 10:42.745
I use an appropriate amount

10:42.780 --> 10:44.080
Of ketchup.

10:44.114 --> 10:49.152
Let's go fix this right now.

10:49.187 --> 10:50.554
Cat, are you coming?

10:50.588 --> 10:51.488
Oh my God!

10:51.523 --> 11:00.731
Underwear that floats.

11:00.765 --> 11:01.731
Okay, what do we got,

11:01.766 --> 11:03.933
What do we got?

11:03.967 --> 11:05.034
I got Cat

11:05.068 --> 11:06.068
Receiving another order

11:06.103 --> 11:06.869
From that sky store

11:06.904 --> 11:08.070
Catalog thing.

11:08.105 --> 11:09.038
Whoa, isn't that like

11:09.072 --> 11:11.107
Her fifth delivery this week?

11:11.141 --> 11:12.475
Yeah, chick's outta control.

11:12.509 --> 11:15.377
No doubt.

11:15.411 --> 11:16.912
No, there were supposed

11:16.946 --> 11:18.180
To be two packages.

11:18.214 --> 11:20.583
I only got one.

11:20.617 --> 11:21.150
It was supposed

11:21.184 --> 11:22.718
To get here on...

11:22.752 --> 11:25.487
Hey, why are you shooting this?

11:25.521 --> 11:26.421
Who are you with?

11:26.455 --> 11:27.188
Robarazzi.

11:29.791 --> 11:31.659
Girl's got a problem.

11:31.693 --> 11:32.526
No doubt.

11:32.560 --> 11:33.861
And, I'm gonna go out

11:33.895 --> 11:34.962
On a limb here and say

11:34.996 --> 11:36.330
That's probably not

11:36.364 --> 11:39.300
Her natural hair color.

11:39.334 --> 11:42.069
Funny stuff, Rob.

11:42.103 --> 11:43.704
Okay, what else we got?

11:44.673 --> 11:45.639
I don't use any more ketchup

11:45.674 --> 11:47.542
Than the next guy.

11:47.576 --> 11:48.175
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:48.210 --> 11:48.743
Come on you guys,

11:48.777 --> 11:49.343
We're in the middle

11:49.378 --> 11:50.244
Of taping my show.

11:50.279 --> 11:50.978
Beck and I

11:51.013 --> 11:52.647
Are not "splitsville."

11:52.681 --> 11:53.281
Well...

11:53.315 --> 11:53.881
Is there something

11:53.916 --> 11:55.883
You wanna talk about?

11:55.917 --> 11:56.817
Kidding.

11:56.852 --> 11:57.818
Are you guys getting this

11:57.853 --> 11:58.586
'Cause this is really

11:58.620 --> 11:59.853
Great stuff.

11:59.888 --> 12:00.721
Robbie.

12:00.755 --> 12:01.388
You're not gonna have

12:01.423 --> 12:02.056
Any friends left

12:02.090 --> 12:03.057
If you keep exploiting us

12:03.091 --> 12:04.291
For your dumb blog.

12:04.326 --> 12:08.629
Okay, we have Tori

12:08.663 --> 12:12.099
Freaking out.

12:12.133 --> 12:12.900
Is he serious?

12:12.934 --> 12:13.367
Really?

12:13.402 --> 12:23.210
This is ridiculous.

12:23.244 --> 12:25.346
Stop!

12:25.380 --> 12:26.881
This is your last chance.

12:26.915 --> 12:27.515
Are you gonna stop

12:27.549 --> 12:31.121
This Robarazzi thing or not?

12:33.155 --> 12:34.756
Coming up on Robarazzi,

12:34.791 --> 12:37.359
Tori, Andre, Beck, Jade,

12:37.393 --> 12:38.293
All caught

12:38.328 --> 12:39.971
On a psychotic rampage.

12:50.005 --> 12:51.355
Is anyone safe?

13:15.887 --> 13:17.989
I am so mad at Robbie.

13:18.023 --> 13:18.923
I feel like everyone's staring

13:18.957 --> 13:20.458
At my pimple.

13:20.492 --> 13:22.928
Everyone is.

13:22.962 --> 13:24.396
How do you think I feel?

13:24.430 --> 13:25.697
Five people today have asked me

13:25.732 --> 13:28.800
About my ketchup addiction.

13:28.835 --> 13:29.601
One kid called me

13:29.636 --> 13:31.303
"Mister ketchup."

13:31.337 --> 13:33.071
It's all Tori's fault.

13:33.105 --> 13:34.038
Really?

13:34.073 --> 13:34.706
They were about to

13:34.740 --> 13:36.374
Kick Robbie off the slap.

13:36.409 --> 13:37.275
You were the one who told him

13:37.309 --> 13:37.976
To start reporting

13:38.010 --> 13:38.843
On our personal lives.

13:38.877 --> 13:39.978
Then you gave him ideas

13:40.012 --> 13:40.578
By letting him

13:40.612 --> 13:41.212
Shoot video of you

13:41.246 --> 13:42.613
Playing with your pimple.

13:42.647 --> 13:44.882
Gimme the salt.

13:44.916 --> 13:46.550
Hey Andre, we thought

13:46.585 --> 13:49.019
You might need this.

13:49.054 --> 13:52.857
Save some for dinner.

13:52.891 --> 13:54.258
I do not have

13:54.293 --> 13:57.461
A ketchup problem.

13:57.496 --> 13:59.030
Andre, Andre, right here.

14:01.233 --> 14:02.567
Get out of here.

14:02.601 --> 14:03.668
Who were they?

14:03.702 --> 14:04.936
Robarazzis.

14:04.971 --> 14:05.570
Robbie's little

14:05.605 --> 14:07.038
Ninth-Grade photographers.

14:07.072 --> 14:07.806
Aw, man!

14:07.840 --> 14:09.007
Now, Robbie's got pics of me

14:09.041 --> 14:09.574
With this

14:09.609 --> 14:11.643
Industrial-size ketchup.

14:11.677 --> 14:12.878
We gotta do something.

14:12.912 --> 14:14.313
Clearly.

14:14.347 --> 14:14.880
I think we just

14:14.914 --> 14:15.481
Have to show Robbie

14:15.515 --> 14:16.148
That we're not gonna be

14:16.182 --> 14:17.016
His friends until he stops

14:17.050 --> 14:21.587
Embarrassing everybody.

14:21.621 --> 14:22.888
That's from sky store?

14:23.723 --> 14:24.723
What is it?

14:24.757 --> 14:25.490
It's the world's most

14:25.524 --> 14:27.125
Powerful portable juicer,

14:27.159 --> 14:30.595
For juicing on the go.

14:30.629 --> 14:32.197
You're so screwed up.

14:32.231 --> 14:33.798
No, it's really cool.

14:33.833 --> 14:46.878
Look it...

14:46.912 --> 14:50.415
See?

14:50.449 --> 14:52.851
You juiced my pizza.

14:52.886 --> 14:57.923
Why chew what you can drink?

14:57.958 --> 14:59.526
What's up, m'peeps?

14:59.560 --> 15:00.193
How's everyone doin'

15:00.228 --> 15:04.031
This fine day?

15:04.065 --> 15:04.665
Do you really need

15:04.699 --> 15:06.803
That much ketchup?

15:10.373 --> 15:11.173
Wait, Jade, what are you doing?

15:11.207 --> 15:13.876
Jade.

15:13.911 --> 15:15.345
What's wrong with you guys?

15:15.379 --> 15:16.380
Stop embarrassing us

15:16.414 --> 15:18.615
On your dumb Robarazzi blog.

15:18.650 --> 15:19.282
Seriously, Rob,

15:19.317 --> 15:21.451
It's not funny anymore, okay.

15:21.485 --> 15:22.419
You guys

15:22.453 --> 15:23.954
Embarrass yourselves.

15:23.988 --> 15:24.855
I just get it on tape

15:24.889 --> 15:26.657
And show the world.

15:26.691 --> 15:27.525
Well, we don't wanna

15:27.559 --> 15:29.593
Be your friends till you stop.

15:29.628 --> 15:30.427
Fine.

15:30.462 --> 15:31.095
Lots of other people

15:31.129 --> 15:32.430
Wanna be my friends,

15:32.464 --> 15:35.399
Smart and attractive people.

15:35.433 --> 15:40.204
See ya on the web.

15:40.238 --> 15:40.704
Do you want me

15:40.739 --> 15:41.606
To juice your bagel?

15:41.640 --> 15:46.010
I really don't.

16:01.828 --> 16:02.761
Cat...

16:02.795 --> 16:03.895
Oh, hey Lane.

16:03.930 --> 16:04.663
You know, you're supposed

16:04.697 --> 16:05.464
To be in your improv class

16:05.498 --> 16:06.098
Right now?

16:06.133 --> 16:07.133
Oh, sorry,

16:07.167 --> 16:08.167
I just got this new thing

16:08.202 --> 16:09.235
From sky store, and...

16:09.269 --> 16:09.769
Yeah, you know,

16:09.803 --> 16:10.670
Some teachers and students here

16:10.704 --> 16:11.304
Think you're buying

16:11.338 --> 16:13.072
Too many things from sky store.

16:13.107 --> 16:13.673
I hear you've been

16:13.707 --> 16:15.374
Borrowing money from people?

16:15.409 --> 16:16.475
Not anymore.

16:16.510 --> 16:17.143
I started using

16:17.177 --> 16:19.712
My parents' credit card.

16:19.747 --> 16:20.780
Okay, but still...

16:20.814 --> 16:21.681
Y'know what this is?

16:21.715 --> 16:22.281
No, and I really

16:22.315 --> 16:22.815
Don't have time.

16:22.849 --> 16:23.349
I've got...

16:23.383 --> 16:25.951
It's the ball freshener.

16:25.986 --> 16:26.718
Cat, I think we need to talk

16:26.753 --> 16:28.053
About this, cause...

16:28.087 --> 16:28.987
See this filthy

16:29.022 --> 16:31.023
Icky tennis ball?

16:31.057 --> 16:32.057
Yeah.

16:32.091 --> 16:39.630
Look it.

16:39.665 --> 16:43.134
Fresh as a daisy.

16:43.168 --> 16:44.936
Do you even play tennis?

16:44.970 --> 16:48.072
No, but I'm gonna learn

16:48.106 --> 16:48.872
With the world's

16:48.907 --> 16:52.342
Thinnest tennis racquet.

16:52.377 --> 16:53.544
Cat, does a person

16:53.578 --> 16:54.211
Really need to have

16:54.246 --> 16:55.045
A tennis racquet that...

16:55.080 --> 16:58.048
Wow, it's so light.

17:07.390 --> 17:08.022
Who are you,

17:08.058 --> 17:10.625
And why is your number blocked?

17:10.660 --> 17:12.760
Jade?

17:12.795 --> 17:13.461
Wait.

17:13.496 --> 17:16.063
Jade, I didn't...

17:16.097 --> 17:18.165
Why are you screaming at me?

17:18.199 --> 17:20.032
How is it my fault that Robbie...

17:20.067 --> 17:21.800
Jade, okay, okay, yes.

17:21.836 --> 17:32.913
I'll watch it, right now.

17:32.947 --> 17:34.848
Welcome to Robarazzi,

17:34.882 --> 17:38.284
Starring Robbie Shapiro.

17:38.886 --> 17:39.619
Wait, wait, wait!

17:39.654 --> 17:40.620
You got what?

17:40.655 --> 17:41.855
I got Beck and Jade

17:41.889 --> 17:43.657
In the front seat of Beck's car,

17:43.692 --> 17:48.596
And you need to see this.

17:48.631 --> 17:49.998
Come on, let's just go.

17:50.033 --> 17:51.266
It'll be fun.

17:51.301 --> 17:52.801
No!

17:52.836 --> 17:53.569
Why not?

17:53.603 --> 17:54.703
'Cause I didn't shower

17:54.737 --> 17:55.170
This morning,

17:55.205 --> 17:57.106
And I had tuna fish for lunch,

17:57.140 --> 17:59.208
And... there's a dude

17:59.242 --> 17:59.942
In the back seat.

17:59.976 --> 18:00.809
What the...hey man.

18:00.843 --> 18:01.644
Get out.

18:01.678 --> 18:02.211
What are you doing?

18:02.245 --> 18:02.812
This is my car.

18:02.846 --> 18:03.445
Are you out of your mind?

18:03.480 --> 18:04.112
What's wrong with you?

18:04.147 --> 18:04.913
I'm gonna kill you.

18:04.947 --> 18:08.450
Can you believe this?

18:08.484 --> 18:10.118
Hey, Tor.

18:10.153 --> 18:11.086
Hi, mom.

18:11.120 --> 18:13.821
Take off your shirt.

18:13.856 --> 18:14.655
Why?

18:14.690 --> 18:15.556
When was the last time

18:15.591 --> 18:17.124
You shaved under your arms?

18:17.159 --> 18:18.058
I dunno, last night,

18:18.093 --> 18:18.792
This morning?

18:18.827 --> 18:20.394
Are you stubbly yet?

18:20.429 --> 18:22.297
Maybe a little.

18:22.331 --> 18:23.198
Oh, good.

18:23.232 --> 18:24.800
Shirt off, come on.

18:24.834 --> 18:25.968
Okay.

18:26.002 --> 18:26.469
You wanna tell me

18:26.503 --> 18:27.503
What this is about?

18:27.537 --> 18:28.137
I found this new

18:28.171 --> 18:29.572
Depilatory cream from sweden,

18:29.606 --> 18:30.507
And it totally made me

18:30.541 --> 18:32.108
Think of you.

18:32.143 --> 18:32.876
Why me?

18:32.910 --> 18:34.511
Depila-Tori?

18:34.545 --> 18:37.114
Oh, my God.

18:37.148 --> 18:39.783
Okay, arms up, all the way.

18:39.817 --> 18:41.017
All right.

18:41.051 --> 18:44.220
Now, we just smear this stuff

18:44.255 --> 18:48.190
Under both your arms,

18:48.225 --> 18:49.258
And in 15 minutes

18:49.292 --> 18:50.192
Your pits will be smooth

18:50.226 --> 18:51.894
As a baby's butt.

18:51.928 --> 18:53.695
I can't wait.

18:53.729 --> 18:54.529
Why does it seem like

18:54.563 --> 18:56.430
You're in a weird mood?

18:56.465 --> 18:57.398
'Cause...

18:57.432 --> 18:58.632
You know my friend Robbie?

18:58.666 --> 19:00.100
Glasses, puppet, afro?

19:00.134 --> 19:01.535
Yeah.

19:01.569 --> 19:02.102
He started doing

19:02.136 --> 19:03.737
This online blog thing...

19:04.706 --> 19:05.639
Hey, who's out?

19:06.574 --> 19:07.507
Hey, get out of here.

19:07.542 --> 19:07.908
Arms up.

19:07.942 --> 19:09.209
Go, get away.

19:09.243 --> 19:09.743
What are you doing?

19:09.777 --> 19:12.879
Go, get off my patio.

19:12.914 --> 19:13.547
Can you believe...

19:13.581 --> 19:14.681
Keep your arms up.

19:14.716 --> 19:16.549
They're up.

19:16.584 --> 19:17.417
Okay, I need to put an end

19:17.451 --> 19:18.351
To this now.

19:18.385 --> 19:19.686
End to what?

19:19.720 --> 19:20.453
Why do those kids

19:20.487 --> 19:28.494
Want pictures of you?

19:28.528 --> 19:29.228
What up

19:29.262 --> 19:32.564
With Tori Vega's armpits?

19:46.913 --> 19:47.846
Where are they?

19:47.881 --> 19:48.847
Patience.

19:48.882 --> 19:49.515
But they finished gym

19:49.549 --> 19:50.382
10 minutes ago.

19:50.417 --> 19:51.083
It takes time

19:51.118 --> 19:51.951
To get from the locker room

19:51.985 --> 19:53.586
All the way here.

19:53.621 --> 19:55.288
Hey, did that pit cream work?

19:55.323 --> 19:59.727
Never speak of it.

20:00.495 --> 20:03.530
Turn it on, turn it on.

20:03.565 --> 20:04.231
We got 'em.

20:04.266 --> 20:05.332
He's right behind us.

20:05.367 --> 20:06.333
It's not funny.

20:06.368 --> 20:06.834
You guys better

20:06.868 --> 20:07.434
Give me back my clothes,

20:07.469 --> 20:08.769
Or I swear I'm gonna tell...

20:08.803 --> 20:11.172
Ah, turn off the camera.

20:11.206 --> 20:11.772
Why?

20:11.806 --> 20:13.073
You look so cute.

20:13.107 --> 20:14.941
Dance for us, Robbie.

20:14.976 --> 20:17.644
Gimme back my clothes.

20:17.678 --> 20:19.112
Should we?

20:19.146 --> 20:20.280
No!

20:21.448 --> 20:22.081
Yeah, I think we need

20:22.116 --> 20:23.383
To put this video online.

20:23.417 --> 20:23.850
What?

20:23.884 --> 20:24.484
No.

20:24.519 --> 20:25.452
Sorry.

20:25.487 --> 20:26.053
The people wanna see

20:26.087 --> 20:27.454
What the people wanna see.

20:27.489 --> 20:28.122
You cannot put

20:28.156 --> 20:30.424
This video online.

20:30.459 --> 20:31.392
Okay.

20:31.426 --> 20:32.560
No problem.

20:32.594 --> 20:33.594
We'll kill the video.

20:33.628 --> 20:34.195
As long as

20:34.229 --> 20:35.729
You kill Robarazzi.

20:35.764 --> 20:36.830
Wh...? No.

20:36.865 --> 20:37.865
Yes.

20:37.899 --> 20:39.233
But my blog is a hit.

20:39.268 --> 20:39.667
All right,

20:39.702 --> 20:40.268
Then I'm just gonna

20:40.302 --> 20:40.969
Zoom in right here.

20:41.504 --> 20:42.404
No, no, don't.

20:42.438 --> 20:44.639
Are you gonna stop?

20:44.673 --> 20:45.239
Well, if I don't

20:45.274 --> 20:45.940
Do Robarazzi,

20:45.975 --> 20:46.574
What am I gonna do

20:46.609 --> 20:50.446
For my blog on the slap?

20:50.480 --> 20:56.451
Low fat recipes.

20:56.485 --> 20:57.752
Okay, what do we got,

20:57.787 --> 20:58.820
What do we got?

20:58.854 --> 20:59.821
I got a lasagna

20:59.855 --> 21:00.989
With only 90 calories

21:01.023 --> 21:02.457
And 4 grams of fat.

21:02.491 --> 21:04.226
Oh, lasagna.

21:04.260 --> 21:05.026
What else?

21:05.061 --> 21:06.161
I got baked onion rings,

21:06.195 --> 21:07.329
Two points.

21:07.363 --> 21:09.030
Must have a lot of fiber.

21:09.065 --> 21:09.965
Go.

21:09.999 --> 21:10.699
I found a non-Fat

21:10.733 --> 21:12.501
Blueberry muffin recipe.

21:12.535 --> 21:13.268
B-B muffins,

21:13.302 --> 21:15.170
Now that is outrageous.

21:15.204 --> 21:16.371
Wait'll you taste 'em.

21:16.405 --> 21:23.312
You taste 'em.

21:39.162 --> 21:41.964
Come on, lemme have it.

21:41.998 --> 21:42.631
But maybe I can

21:42.666 --> 21:43.599
Talk my parents into giving me

21:43.633 --> 21:45.467
My credit card back.

21:45.501 --> 21:46.268
Cat...

21:46.302 --> 21:47.002
It's time to say goodbye

21:47.036 --> 21:48.002
To sky store.

21:48.037 --> 21:48.636
Don't you think

21:48.671 --> 21:50.584
That's the best thing to do?

22:03.618 --> 22:04.451
Look, I know it hurts now,

22:04.486 --> 22:06.254
But you'll feel better soon.

22:06.288 --> 22:07.355
I know.

22:07.390 --> 22:09.258
Wanna come hang for a while?

22:09.292 --> 22:10.626
Nah, thanks.

22:10.660 --> 22:12.595
I just wanna sit here.

22:12.629 --> 22:14.464
Okay.

22:14.498 --> 22:15.832
Bye.

22:15.866 --> 22:17.212
See ya, sport.

22:29.213 --> 22:30.947
Hey, Sinjin!

22:30.982 --> 22:32.382
Yes?

22:32.416 --> 22:33.683
Do you have a girlfriend?

22:33.718 --> 22:35.552
No.

22:35.586 --> 22:38.622
You have a credit card?

22:38.656 --> 22:41.057
Yeah.

22:41.091 --> 22:41.624
Why don't you

22:41.658 --> 22:44.761
Call me sometime?

22:44.795 --> 22:45.562
Really?

22:46.231 --> 22:48.708
Okay, I'll go buy a phone.

22:55.742 --> 22:57.610
Oh my God, a litter box

22:57.645 --> 22:59.826
That plays classical music.
