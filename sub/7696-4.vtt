01:57.241 --> 01:59.827
Bruce? Bruce Wayne?

02:00.411 --> 02:01.912
Over here, Lucius.

02:05.541 --> 02:08.127
Bruce, it's 3:00 in the morning.
Couldn't this wait?

02:08.836 --> 02:11.005
I could've given you this stuff
in the office.

02:13.507 --> 02:14.550
Not out here.

02:18.054 --> 02:19.096
Come on.

02:28.439 --> 02:31.942
My phones are bugged.
The office, the house, everywhere.

02:33.694 --> 02:35.196
He knows we're on to him.

02:35.821 --> 02:36.822
Daggett?

02:39.075 --> 02:42.536
Who else? You were the one who said
he was trying to take over the company.

02:43.120 --> 02:45.414
Yes. Insider trading.

02:46.749 --> 02:49.710
But once you give these papers
to the DA, he'll be under indictment

02:49.835 --> 02:51.629
before he can change his socks.

02:51.879 --> 02:54.674
If I turn in the evidence. But I won't.

02:56.008 --> 02:59.303
You see, Lucius, the reason I want
those papers is to destroy them.

03:00.596 --> 03:03.891
And now, that you've brought them,
we won't be needing you anymore.

03:04.475 --> 03:07.478
Bruce, what's going on here?

03:07.603 --> 03:13.359
Let's just say
I'm accepting your resignation, Mr. Fox.

03:37.758 --> 03:39.885
<i><i>Two-Baker-six. Two-Baker-six.</i></i>

03:40.052 --> 03:42.138
<i>204 at Gotham Island Tramway,</i>

03:42.304 --> 03:44.932
<i>south-side terminal. Respond, code 2.</i>

03:46.892 --> 03:48.144
Let's finish this.

03:48.352 --> 03:49.353
Fast

03:49.437 --> 03:51.272
Before we have the law on our necks.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.232
Too late, dirtbag.

03:53.315 --> 03:54.358
Huh?

03:54.442 --> 03:55.443
Who said that?

03:56.110 --> 03:58.320
The Batman! Not him!

04:04.285 --> 04:05.286
Where is he?

05:35.668 --> 05:38.671
Wayne. Bruce Wayne.

05:39.421 --> 05:41.048
He set me up.

05:42.591 --> 05:43.592
Cover me!

05:52.476 --> 05:54.103
Stay where you are! Don't move!

06:26.260 --> 06:27.428
Ready on the set.

06:29.972 --> 06:31.348
I'll go get Matt.

06:42.860 --> 06:45.195
Come on, come on. Where are you?

06:47.323 --> 06:49.408
Matt, uh, you okay in there?

06:55.706 --> 06:56.957
Close the door!

06:57.750 --> 06:59.293
It's Teddy, Matt.

07:00.294 --> 07:01.879
Close the door!

07:02.838 --> 07:03.839
Help me look.

07:03.923 --> 07:05.633
It's gotta be in here somewhere.

07:06.467 --> 07:09.470
The face cream?
You used up your last jar yesterday.

07:11.096 --> 07:13.349
I gotta have more! Now, see.

07:13.515 --> 07:17.061
It wore off.
Look! I can't fix it anymore!

07:17.603 --> 07:18.896
Relax, Matt.

07:19.021 --> 07:20.898
Don't tell me to relax, you idiot!

07:21.273 --> 07:23.067
I can't go out there like this!

07:24.151 --> 07:25.152
Here.

07:26.362 --> 07:27.613
Give it to me!

07:32.493 --> 07:34.370
Huh? That's all?

07:35.412 --> 07:37.873
I was lucky I could
hang on to that much.

07:41.502 --> 07:43.045
You were holding out on me?

07:43.128 --> 07:46.298
I had to, Matt. If I didn't,
you wouldn't have any now.

07:53.764 --> 07:57.726
You can't go on like this, Matt.
You hurt all the time now.

07:57.935 --> 07:59.728
You're just my stand-in.

07:59.853 --> 08:02.147
Nobody promoted you to nursemaid.

08:02.523 --> 08:04.900
That stuff
makes your face like putty, Matt.

08:04.984 --> 08:06.110
It can't be good for you.

08:06.610 --> 08:08.362
It probably ain't good for me.

08:08.612 --> 08:10.823
But unless I only wanna do
horror pictures,

08:10.948 --> 08:13.158
it ain't bad for me either.

08:14.785 --> 08:15.786
Gone!

08:16.120 --> 08:17.121
Empty!

08:17.663 --> 08:19.498
Only 24 hours,

08:19.581 --> 08:22.668
then it starts all over again.

08:24.378 --> 08:26.380
Mr. Hagen, we're waiting!

08:26.755 --> 08:27.756
Keep your shirt on!

08:30.092 --> 08:31.802
That's what ain't good for you.

08:31.927 --> 08:34.930
Having to keep going back
to Daggett for more of that stuff,

08:35.055 --> 08:37.599
and do whatever lousy thing
he wants to get it.

08:38.809 --> 08:41.103
You're right, Teddy. I can't.

08:41.478 --> 08:45.899
I'll have to find a way
to get lots of this stuff on my own.

08:56.660 --> 08:57.953
You're sure, Bell?

08:59.997 --> 09:03.542
You're sure that the man you hired
knows nothing about our operation?

09:07.629 --> 09:09.673
Bell! I asked you a question.

09:18.474 --> 09:20.476
Germs, take off his headphones.

09:22.311 --> 09:24.563
Pay attention.
Mr. Daggett is talking to you.

09:30.235 --> 09:31.236
Now, then.

09:31.320 --> 09:32.988
Relax, Mr. Daggett.

09:33.072 --> 09:36.283
The guy was just a hired gun.
He don't even know our names.

09:36.784 --> 09:39.119
Thank heaven for small favors.

09:40.746 --> 09:44.583
But Hagen has disappointed me
once too often lately.

09:45.084 --> 09:47.294
He botched this assignment completely.

09:47.377 --> 09:51.965
To wit, once Fox is able to talk,
he might very well incriminate us,

09:52.049 --> 09:55.636
if the police can't figure out
what we're up to from those papers

09:55.761 --> 09:58.138
Hagen was supposed to retrieve.

10:00.140 --> 10:01.141
Frankly,

10:02.017 --> 10:05.312
I think our Mr. Hagen
has outlived his usefulness.

10:06.146 --> 10:08.816
I want him dealt with.

10:09.316 --> 10:12.236
But, Mr. Daggett,
the man's a master of disguise.

10:12.569 --> 10:16.406
He was even before he had his accident,
and you gave him this stuff.

10:16.490 --> 10:20.410
Yeah. It's not easy finding somebody
who can change the way he looks.

10:22.454 --> 10:25.082
You needn't bother searching for him.

10:25.666 --> 10:29.336
This is the only place in the world
where he can get what he needs.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.880
And when his supply runs out,

10:32.381 --> 10:34.466
he'll come to us.

11:11.503 --> 11:13.380
Hold it right there.

11:14.298 --> 11:16.258
Turn around, real slow.

11:16.675 --> 11:19.011
Step into the light
where we can see you.

11:20.679 --> 11:22.431
I'm looking for Mr. Daggett.

11:22.598 --> 11:23.807
I don't believe we've met.

11:23.891 --> 11:27.060
My name is Wayne. Bruce Wayne.

11:32.191 --> 11:35.360
Wayne, huh? Yeah, right. Sure.

11:37.321 --> 11:39.573
Can the garbage, Hagen. We ain't stupid.

11:48.498 --> 11:50.667
- No!
- You're Hagen, all right.

11:50.751 --> 11:53.045
Broke in for more of that stuff,
didn't you?

11:53.170 --> 11:56.798
Yeah, once they're hooked,
they stay hooked.

11:57.758 --> 12:00.719
Come on, Hagen,
we're going for a little ride.

12:01.053 --> 12:03.722
Forget it! I know what that means!

12:15.150 --> 12:17.277
Wait! I got an idea.

12:17.736 --> 12:18.737
Hold him.

12:26.870 --> 12:29.122
Pretty boy wanted more of this stuff?

12:29.456 --> 12:31.166
Then let's give it to him.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.168
No! Not that way!

12:33.377 --> 12:34.711
Please!

12:35.420 --> 12:38.131
Let's give him
all he'll ever need.

12:38.215 --> 12:39.216
No!

12:39.716 --> 12:42.344
No! Don't!

12:53.981 --> 12:56.692
Sweet dreams, slimeball.

13:11.999 --> 13:15.919
I know my fist has landed
on that jaw once before.

13:33.478 --> 13:35.772
Bell. Raymond Bell.

13:35.897 --> 13:38.650
Of course! Now I remember him.

13:40.902 --> 13:45.407
Carries a pocket radio,
tuned to police band at all times.

13:47.701 --> 13:50.120
Master Bruce,
what am I to do about the police?

13:50.245 --> 13:51.955
They shall be back, you know.

13:52.080 --> 13:54.333
I can't keep telling them you're out.

13:55.125 --> 13:57.544
Police? What police?

13:57.627 --> 13:59.171
What are you talking about?

13:59.671 --> 14:02.799
I suggest you consult
the morning paper, sir.

14:05.510 --> 14:07.929
"Bruce Wayne
sought for questioning

14:08.013 --> 14:10.223
"in attempt on executive's life"?

14:10.349 --> 14:12.351
But that's impossible!

14:15.604 --> 14:19.399

14:54.309 --> 14:58.105
Armed and dangerous.
Proceed with extreme caution. Over.

14:58.980 --> 15:00.816
Yeah, go ahead.

15:01.191 --> 15:02.901
Stake out my place.

15:02.984 --> 15:05.237
It'll be a long wait, jerks.

15:17.749 --> 15:22.212
That's it, Bell. Keep it up.
You're reacting true to form so far.

15:43.233 --> 15:45.777
The Batman?

15:57.372 --> 16:00.292
Made it! I am out of here!

16:02.294 --> 16:03.503
Huh?

16:39.873 --> 16:42.125
No!

16:45.545 --> 16:46.796
Oh, no!

17:26.253 --> 17:30.799
No! For the love of mercy, Batman,
don't let me fall!

17:36.012 --> 17:38.640
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

17:38.765 --> 17:40.392
Listen up, scumwad.

17:40.517 --> 17:42.602
<i>Because I'm only gonna ask you once.</i>

17:52.654 --> 17:55.282
<i>Who was Lucius Fox meeting at the tram?</i>

17:55.490 --> 17:57.993
Wayne! Bruce Wayne!

17:58.451 --> 18:00.745
You lying sleaze!

18:02.205 --> 18:04.165
<i>You wanna rethink that answer?</i>

18:04.583 --> 18:08.211
No! No!

18:08.628 --> 18:11.423
Okay, okay, it wasn't Wayne!

18:11.756 --> 18:14.259
Then who was it?

18:22.434 --> 18:25.937
Last chance.
Who was impersonating Wayne?

18:30.650 --> 18:33.445
Who, Bell? Who?

18:36.281 --> 18:38.283
Fainted. He fainted.

18:45.707 --> 18:50.211
<i>This is GCPD airborne unit

19:04.768 --> 19:07.145
This should wake you up, Mr. Bell.

19:16.321 --> 19:19.741
This is the police!
You are under arrest!

19:37.967 --> 19:38.968
No-

19:39.260 --> 19:40.261
Please,

19:40.970 --> 19:42.514
leave me alone.

19:43.181 --> 19:45.433
Lucius, it's okay. It's me, Bruce.

19:45.558 --> 19:47.102
I have to speak to you.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.521
Only you can give me
the answers I need now.

19:49.854 --> 19:51.314
Lucius, take it easy.

19:51.398 --> 19:52.857
There's nothing to be afraid of.

19:53.316 --> 19:55.610
You know I'd never do anything
to hurt you.

20:05.954 --> 20:08.373
Ah, there's his car. Stop here.

20:21.511 --> 20:23.179
Matt, are you in there?

20:29.144 --> 20:32.856

updates on this late-breaking story.
