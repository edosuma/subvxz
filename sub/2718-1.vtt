Grendel

03:02.148 --> 03:03.445
Pappie

03:58.504 --> 04:01.837
Yahhhhh!!! Yahhhhhh

07:37.423 --> 07:42.759
Ahhhh Owwee.

07:45.731 --> 07:52.295
Aohhhhheeweee

07:56.542 --> 07:58.066
Yoeyeo

07:58.210 --> 08:04.911
Yahhhheeoooooooooweewaaaa

08:15.194 --> 08:22.157
Let this great horn tell the world
no man stands above the Danes.

08:22.601 --> 08:26.332
All we look up on is ours.

08:27.606 --> 08:32.066
Hrothgar much loved king of the Danes.

08:32.244 --> 08:38.649
Under Odirs eye I blood you lucky
on all parts that leave this hall.

08:43.923 --> 08:47.654
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh!

08:48.294 --> 08:53.231
Blahhhhhhhhhehhhhhhahhhhh!

08:53.766 --> 09:00.194
Ahhhhhh! Blehhahhhhh!

09:13.919 --> 09:19.186
May all those who cross
these steps find a happy heart.

09:19.325 --> 09:21.088
Yay!

10:02.701 --> 10:03.690
Olaf!

10:13.646 --> 10:16.012
Olaf! Pal!

11:09.401 --> 11:11.335
Where were you when all this happened?

11:12.504 --> 11:13.766
Asleep.

11:17.076 --> 11:18.509
I'd had some beers.

11:21.213 --> 11:23.511
What fucking thing would dare...

13:06.885 --> 13:07.909
G'day

13:09.488 --> 13:10.614
G'Day.

13:14.960 --> 13:17.656
I'd love much to know man, whereabouts?

13:19.031 --> 13:20.430
Fish beach.

13:21.133 --> 13:23.294
Likely I'm the only one
who names it that.

13:24.303 --> 13:25.600
Where I get fish.

13:29.641 --> 13:30.699
I'm Beowulf

13:30.843 --> 13:31.832
Beowulf?

13:32.478 --> 13:36.881
Yea Beowulf the what?
Heh? The eel meal?

13:42.921 --> 13:47.017
You've never had another?
Wash up like myself?

13:47.726 --> 13:50.126
In the name of Breca? Ahhh.

13:51.830 --> 13:55.789
We were out hunting walrus
a couple of days ago...

13:56.135 --> 13:58.797
when a storm came up and ate our boat.

13:59.805 --> 14:01.796
So this is just you coming in now?

14:02.841 --> 14:03.933
Yeah

14:05.778 --> 14:09.942
You've ever swum in the open sea?

14:10.649 --> 14:12.048
I leave that to my boat.

14:13.652 --> 14:15.677
Ahh. I'd like to think you'd botter me.

14:16.522 --> 14:20.686
I can't see much life in that.
Do you do this a lot?

14:21.427 --> 14:22.860
I take what comes.

14:23.028 --> 14:27.931
Good then you'll have no qualms
if supper tastes like you.

14:30.135 --> 14:33.400
Eat, be yourself.

14:39.311 --> 14:43.270
So, what's it like being a hero?

14:43.816 --> 14:48.844
Qualling things with axes and,
and that sword of yours. And what.

14:49.288 --> 14:52.086
Kinda bloody madness. Heh

14:52.324 --> 14:54.849
In truth I don't get all that mad.

15:14.780 --> 15:20.616
So, ahhh hahh-hhhah,
A hero ahhh, A hero for supper.

15:21.320 --> 15:24.380
Don't my shit shine.
Hah, hahhhh, hahhh

15:25.691 --> 15:27.056
I'm in your debt

15:28.827 --> 15:35.630
I'm in the fishes.
All these days have come for theirs.

15:48.947 --> 15:50.505
The winds were kind.

15:50.649 --> 15:55.313
No storm waylaid Sawthwood
from his hard walk home.

15:55.988 --> 16:01.085
None in Geatland held so strong the love
of kin as Beowulf.

16:01.326 --> 16:03.954
But coming home he heard the tale.

16:04.096 --> 16:07.623
Friends to the west
slept with slaughter.

16:07.866 --> 16:11.859
...from death upon the Danes.

16:12.137 --> 16:16.733
Great Beowulf alone had best it bares
thought fearless in their mood

16:16.875 --> 16:20.311
for men but now he brought a half score

16:20.445 --> 16:24.438
or more Geat swords
to swing against this thing.

16:24.583 --> 16:26.016
Let's hear the names

16:28.153 --> 16:29.677
Breca the loud.

16:29.821 --> 16:31.482
HahhhAhhhh

16:31.623 --> 16:33.318
Right from the seas.

16:33.759 --> 16:36.421
Lost no son in hoisting sword.

16:36.562 --> 16:37.529
Hoisting swords?

16:37.663 --> 16:39.756
He couldn't hoist his own sail.

16:40.232 --> 16:43.998
The huncho. Queller of puffins

16:44.136 --> 16:45.899
Hahhh.

16:46.138 --> 16:47.730
...and beer.

16:48.540 --> 16:50.804
Shook his shields to shake the world.

16:50.943 --> 16:53.969
No. Just on that scum troll's head.

16:57.282 --> 16:58.374
Beowulf.

17:05.723 --> 17:13.722
Well as we've done these last few years
this sail holds grim bliss for me.

17:14.398 --> 17:20.929
A thing that takes two hundred
in arms is no small thing.

17:21.740 --> 17:25.574
But I will see Valhalla
or that thing's head on a pole.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.941
Aye, aye, aye

17:28.079 --> 17:34.883
So that Danes might say Geats don't
wield words where swords speak truer.

17:35.020 --> 17:37.250
Ayyye. Yea.

17:41.827 --> 17:48.289
Great as our own shield king Is,
there is another nearest kin to me.

17:51.203 --> 17:55.936
None bleed for a better king
than Hrothgar I'd die happy.

17:56.074 --> 17:57.564
Loved as he.

17:58.744 --> 18:01.008
But we live happy even now.

18:02.347 --> 18:11.745
So, Beowulf goes at dawn to the Danes
all you who go along, keep us proud.

18:11.890 --> 18:15.587
Yeahhh!

18:15.927 --> 18:19.055
And if you can find Hondscioh
a wife our sheep have had enough.

19:49.988 --> 19:51.615
Troll!!!!!!!!!

20:05.036 --> 20:06.503
Trollllllllll!

20:09.107 --> 20:14.135
Trollll!!!!!! I call you out!!!!

20:17.182 --> 20:18.376
Trolll!!!!

20:25.857 --> 20:28.792
Trollllllllllllllll!!!!!!!

20:32.497 --> 20:39.061
Meet me the like if you dare!
Or fight me in hell. You hairy creep.

20:39.438 --> 20:41.372
Creep. Creep!

20:44.209 --> 20:45.540
Ahhhmmm.

21:22.747 --> 21:26.410
Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!

21:39.331 --> 21:40.764
Are you wounded?

21:42.167 --> 21:46.433
The thing wouldn't fight.
It spared me to witness this.

21:46.571 --> 21:50.029
Then get up off your arse
with your Thanes insight.

21:50.175 --> 21:51.403
This is no ground for a game.

21:51.543 --> 21:54.774
Ahh, you're wrong where a king
who has had his balls hauled up

21:54.913 --> 21:56.938
his guts it is the ground.

21:58.817 --> 22:02.253
All the broken bone wretches
I've flung to death.

22:02.387 --> 22:03.945
And to Valhalla.

22:05.757 --> 22:07.088
I don't know.

22:11.463 --> 22:15.194
Is that the look of
a man going happily up to the feast?

22:15.500 --> 22:17.024
Or down to the worms?

22:17.168 --> 22:18.362
You talk like a mad man.

22:18.503 --> 22:21.301
No!
Just like the Danish king of daylight

22:21.439 --> 22:23.907
Get up now or do we bury you here?

22:24.042 --> 22:25.475
Is that your wish?

22:32.784 --> 22:34.615
With your thanes in sight?

22:36.388 --> 22:39.152
Whose wife would you have me be?

23:04.115 --> 23:10.679
A burly sword of Christ to cleave you
thus, and thus and thus!

23:34.546 --> 23:36.707
That's one shiny sword.

23:40.151 --> 23:42.051
I'm told you're the Dane's king.

23:42.487 --> 23:44.011
Connaught wishes you well

23:46.157 --> 23:48.022
Celt, you're a ways from home

23:48.159 --> 23:53.722
I am but safe with the sword of Christ.
Father Brendan.

23:54.032 --> 24:00.995
Christ. I - Heard of him.
You ever have much luck with trolls?

24:01.139 --> 24:03.767
I'm of the thought
they've never crossed paths,

24:04.242 --> 24:06.608
but if you're willing to bow
before Christ you shall feel

24:06.745 --> 24:08.975
the blessing of his great strength.

24:09.114 --> 24:11.514
My gods don't ask me to bow.

24:11.650 --> 24:14.619
And nor should they dare
if they won't protect ye.

24:16.154 --> 24:21.023
To fear god's fools is an honor.
I've come to drive this evil out.

24:22.594 --> 24:23.219
With your stick?

24:23.361 --> 24:25.124
With the fire of heaven!

24:25.196 --> 24:28.029
Well if your heavers on fire
you'd better look to that.

24:28.900 --> 24:31.095
You leave me
on a dish for the troll then.

24:31.302 --> 24:33.668
Leave me.
And if I don't see mars stone.

24:33.805 --> 24:37.070
I shall see god's! I shall see god!

24:37.542 --> 24:38.440
Ahhh!

24:58.496 --> 25:01.795
Selma, should I fear for my husband?

25:08.373 --> 25:09.863
You've got nothing better to do?

25:10.008 --> 25:14.240
Sweet don't play the bitch with me.
I don't ask much and I don't ask often.

25:14.379 --> 25:17.143
No one dares dirty your name around me.

25:17.716 --> 25:19.479
Nor yours around me.

25:28.693 --> 25:32.629
Hrothgar dies happy, in his sleep.

25:33.732 --> 25:35.165
That's a lift.

25:43.508 --> 25:48.172
Selma, I could find
a place for you inside.

25:50.882 --> 25:53.180
We chose our beds along time back.

26:22.113 --> 26:23.239
Men!

26:26.618 --> 26:28.176
Hold there!

26:28.953 --> 26:30.181
As you wish.

26:30.522 --> 26:31.750
Is this land Dane?

26:31.890 --> 26:33.790
It is and you're not.

26:34.092 --> 26:38.961
So unless you're ready for a shower
of arrows you tell who you are!

26:39.097 --> 26:43.033
Two blows from this
and fifty men will be on this beach

26:43.168 --> 26:45.068
before your next breath.

26:45.203 --> 26:47.034
Fifty birds maybe.

26:48.540 --> 26:50.508
Is that then your word?

26:50.675 --> 26:52.108
I'm Beowulf.

26:55.413 --> 26:56.778
Beowulf the Geat?

26:57.048 --> 26:58.208
Ahh, here we go.

26:58.850 --> 27:01.546
We come as friends for Hrothgar.

27:11.529 --> 27:13.394
Well we welcome friends.

27:14.699 --> 27:16.030
Bring what you need.

27:16.167 --> 27:18.032
I'll have men look to your ship.

27:50.468 --> 27:52.095
Welcome to Daneland

28:03.948 --> 28:07.645
By Thor they have the spark of cows.

28:18.630 --> 28:19.927
Who's that?

28:21.566 --> 28:23.431
Selma, a witch.

28:23.568 --> 28:25.900
The happy would keep
a boat length from her

28:26.137 --> 28:27.399
Happiness isn't everything.

28:27.538 --> 28:29.472
She sees people's deaths.

28:46.357 --> 28:48.188
That is one beer hall.

28:48.259 --> 28:50.727
If you like to drink with the ghosts.

28:53.865 --> 28:55.298
Beowulf!

28:59.203 --> 29:05.438
Oh my little Beowulf,
nobody tells me anything.

29:11.382 --> 29:13.646
I somehow think of you as smaller

29:13.785 --> 29:15.878
I was eight when I left.

29:16.454 --> 29:19.082
Ahh you've grown. Ahh.

29:20.725 --> 29:23.592
I'm sorry we didn't mean to wake you.

29:24.128 --> 29:25.288
Wake me.

29:28.533 --> 29:31.934
I'm a grief crippled king half drunk
in the middle of the afternoon,

29:32.070 --> 29:33.697
what's there to wake?

29:35.573 --> 29:38.007
By the gods it's good to see you.

29:39.010 --> 29:43.413
Hahh, hahh!

29:44.515 --> 29:47.143
Hah! Hah!

29:51.889 --> 29:53.481
You think you need a beer?

29:54.625 --> 29:56.422
- Ah, ya.
- Aye.

30:26.891 --> 30:28.791
If Geat were seeking a wife,

30:29.127 --> 30:31.618
this room would hold better
up than most.

30:33.064 --> 30:34.497
So many.

30:34.632 --> 30:35.792
Widows.

30:38.202 --> 30:40.796
Widows far too early.

30:49.680 --> 30:52.308
Ho, ho.

31:04.162 --> 31:05.459
Ah...

31:36.194 --> 31:38.526
With my King I welcome you all.

31:47.438 --> 31:49.804
We can never forget this gift.

32:06.491 --> 32:12.191
Hahh. Nannnnannnannnannnnanaaaan

32:12.730 --> 32:15.961
From this night on
the only working flesh

32:16.100 --> 32:20.059
this troll feasts on will be it's own.

32:20.204 --> 32:22.331
Yae!

32:22.640 --> 32:28.010
With the morning,
your curse will be less than a shadow.

32:28.146 --> 32:29.807
Yas!

32:31.015 --> 32:34.348
Well maybe not less,

32:35.186 --> 32:40.818
but I mean to hold in my hand
the head that by my sword

32:40.958 --> 32:44.359
no more steers a dead troll body.

32:44.495 --> 32:47.396
Yas!

32:47.999 --> 32:50.194
We'll hoist the shield now

32:50.301 --> 32:58.072
Drive that hunger back down it's mouth.
Await, can chew on it's tongue.

32:58.409 --> 33:01.674
It can chew on it's own stinking stone
of a heart,

33:01.812 --> 33:03.473
...but no more Danes.

33:08.653 --> 33:10.678
We mean to put an end to this fiend.

33:10.821 --> 33:12.482
Yas!

33:12.623 --> 33:13.851
As other's vowed

33:13.991 --> 33:15.219
Unferth!

33:17.161 --> 33:19.152
By you will dear Queen.

33:20.031 --> 33:23.194
We're wiser in knowing the hearts of
those who tangled with that thing.

33:23.334 --> 33:25.302
Those are dead.

33:29.740 --> 33:37.169
I don't brag of wrestling with it.
Nor of Being able to kill it.

33:37.915 --> 33:42.579
The troll broke down these doors with
twenty Danish warriors sleeping inside.

33:44.222 --> 33:48.716
What gives thirteen Geats better hope?

33:49.961 --> 33:51.929
We won't be sleeping.

33:55.199 --> 33:56.791
Unferth!

33:57.702 --> 33:58.896
Sit!

34:01.872 --> 34:03.703
Or see your guts in a dish.

34:14.885 --> 34:23.088
Now before the dark will sharpen us -
play, drink.

34:29.367 --> 34:30.356
No.

34:38.676 --> 34:40.576
Since it began we'll have Swedes,

34:40.710 --> 34:44.203
Saxons even Sloths even coming
to see how weak we were.

34:47.952 --> 34:52.389
Ya I know, I look like walrus shit.

34:53.257 --> 34:55.851
Comes from fighting things you can't.

34:55.960 --> 34:57.325
All bad dreams end.

34:58.963 --> 35:02.296
We'll see you in the morning
for herring and egg.

35:03.100 --> 35:04.795
Herring and egg?

35:07.371 --> 35:09.498
Now, if there's anything
you need to tell me about it,

35:09.640 --> 35:12.040
now would be the time.

35:14.612 --> 35:20.881
I'll stay here. Amongst you.

35:24.355 --> 35:29.349
We'll bring you the head -
throw it in with the herring and egg.

36:35.426 --> 36:37.758
MMMMMMMMmmmm

36:37.895 --> 36:41.456
Ahhhh, hahhahahhhaa

37:54.638 --> 38:00.975
Ahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!

39:11.015 --> 39:12.778
Priest.

39:14.518 --> 39:16.349
Where did you spend the night?

39:19.490 --> 39:21.958
Why was such a dark wretch spared?

39:22.092 --> 39:23.616
That's not what he asked.

39:26.730 --> 39:30.222
Wise king.
You must know of the name of Clovis

39:30.367 --> 39:30.890
The Frank?

39:31.035 --> 39:33.526
The Frank, yes, yes, the Frank.

39:34.071 --> 39:37.666
The Christian Sword over land ten times
what the Danes hold dear.

39:37.741 --> 39:38.605
He's dead.

39:38.742 --> 39:40.937
Yes, ten years now.

39:41.078 --> 39:43.478
...but not before he saw God's grace.

39:44.014 --> 39:48.348
The Visigoths of Aquitaine, the Romans
and the Syagrius, Burgundians,

39:48.485 --> 39:52.512
Alamans all fell before him
and all because he had God's ear.

39:52.656 --> 39:55.284
As I recall yours had a thousand swords.

39:55.426 --> 39:59.260
Neighbors offered wine and pork
and no eyes at his ribs.

39:59.396 --> 40:00.954
And no fucking trolls!

40:01.098 --> 40:02.998
And no fucking trolls!

40:03.701 --> 40:08.729
My skinny hand can only bless,
but trust me.

40:08.973 --> 40:15.811
This thing shall meet it's end
in striking me or those of mine.

40:20.017 --> 40:21.951
Madness has it's wonders.

40:22.419 --> 40:25.320
The Celt sat straight in
the path of the thing.

40:25.889 --> 40:27.379
It was not touched.

40:27.891 --> 40:31.918
The Celt held no sword.
Perhaps the thing hates weapons.

40:32.062 --> 40:34.792
The old men were armed, true.

40:34.932 --> 40:37.264
Others here in arms have been spared.

40:37.935 --> 40:41.200
I have been waiting for Odin
to bring me my death.

40:42.306 --> 40:43.773
He hasn't.

40:44.041 --> 40:45.474
In his wisdom?

41:44.935 --> 41:47.301
This is where the blood trails led.

41:52.076 --> 41:54.567
I tell you,
this troll must be one tough prick.

41:55.446 --> 41:57.880
Do this climb every night after supper?

42:24.842 --> 42:26.639
Why don't you blow your horn now,

42:26.877 --> 42:29.072
I wouldn't mind
those fifty bows bragged of.

42:29.213 --> 42:32.205
I could bring the bows.
But the men are gone.

42:34.651 --> 42:35.913
Thorfinn!

42:39.957 --> 42:40.981
Are you alright?

42:41.458 --> 42:43.153
- I'm fine.
- Good

42:49.800 --> 42:51.734
A little high up for driftwood.

42:52.536 --> 42:54.060
What are we fighting here?

42:54.204 --> 42:55.569
A Thing beyond our ken.

43:36.814 --> 43:39.806
Could spread out...
meet back here in a year?

43:51.929 --> 43:53.760
We're out of our world.

44:49.186 --> 44:51.882
Padre, santi...

44:52.022 --> 44:57.619
Go in peace my son, go in peace.
Next!

45:19.316 --> 45:20.977
I was off in a dream.

45:22.552 --> 45:24.577
Wish I could bring a better one.

45:36.199 --> 45:38.190
Baptism they call it.

45:41.438 --> 45:44.874
Unferth feels that he's fallen
from the grace of the gods.

45:51.315 --> 45:53.943
It's not every mars wish
to sit in blood.

45:54.284 --> 45:59.381
If this Christ can stiffen
Unferth's heart, what's the harm?

45:59.589 --> 46:01.853
They swim only out of fear.

46:03.794 --> 46:08.060
But still... they swim.

46:52.542 --> 46:54.032
Dusk soon, eh.

46:54.344 --> 46:55.777
You a herd dog?

46:58.081 --> 47:00.140
I've been called worse.

47:01.385 --> 47:02.682
I'm Beowulf...

47:02.786 --> 47:05.346
Yes. The much-told hero from Geatland.

47:13.463 --> 47:15.124
So who are your people?

47:15.966 --> 47:19.629
None. I came here in my teens.

47:19.736 --> 47:22.398
A whore to Unferth's uncle,
Alvis Three-Legs.

47:25.442 --> 47:27.000
So you're not then Dane?

47:27.144 --> 47:30.841
Oh I am.
My family was killed by Wulfing raiders.

47:31.081 --> 47:35.711
Ah, my father too...
not killed, but...

47:37.020 --> 47:39.386
I mean, but a feud
with the Wulfings brought us here.

47:39.523 --> 47:41.423
I guess you werert made a whore.

47:45.395 --> 47:47.124
I'm told you know of things to come.

47:47.264 --> 47:49.027
Hmm, that's a wide sea.

47:49.666 --> 47:50.928
Of deaths of things.

47:51.268 --> 47:54.726
Seeing that everything living dies
you still give me the sight of gods.

47:55.872 --> 47:59.467
Speak clean. You wonder of yourself.

47:59.576 --> 48:00.941
More of the troll.

48:01.411 --> 48:02.776
Not of yourself?

48:04.281 --> 48:06.181
In some things I'd rather be blind.

48:06.316 --> 48:09.046
You're worse than Loki
with your sheepshit twining.

48:10.053 --> 48:13.750
The death of the troll will cost dear
both the Geats and the Danes...

48:13.957 --> 48:15.652
as it bloody well should.

48:16.827 --> 48:18.192
Why as it should?

48:18.328 --> 48:23.322
The Danes have done their doom on him.
And you come here to kill.

48:23.667 --> 48:25.157
Day's going down.

48:25.402 --> 48:27.131
If we want to be ready...

48:32.342 --> 48:34.435
Careful with what you don't understand.

48:57.000 --> 49:01.767
Has this thing,
this troll killed any children...

49:02.739 --> 49:04.400
- No
- women?

49:06.376 --> 49:07.809
Old men?

49:09.446 --> 49:13.974
What are you saying?
It fights with a clean heart?

49:14.751 --> 49:18.983
It kills the strongest first.
It shows us and kills the strongest.

49:19.122 --> 49:20.987
Who cares if he spares the children?

49:21.124 --> 49:23.354
They'll die anyways
without their fathers.

49:24.361 --> 49:27.262
My wits still war
with how this all began

49:31.301 --> 49:34.532
It came for the mead hall...
I can only guess.

49:35.739 --> 49:38.731
The night we finished it,
before creep came,

49:38.875 --> 49:42.777
we hadrt seen a troll in
fifteen twenty years.

49:43.513 --> 49:45.743
So nothing was done to the troll itself?

49:45.882 --> 49:46.439
Oh Beowulf!

49:46.583 --> 49:48.483
It's a fucking troll!

49:49.286 --> 49:52.119
Maybe someone looked at it
the wrong way!

49:54.257 --> 49:55.622
Some Dane?

49:59.229 --> 50:01.720
Who hands you this? Selma?

50:02.933 --> 50:04.025
Come on.

50:04.167 --> 50:06.465
She's been out in the wilds too long.

50:08.004 --> 50:10.996
Her head is full of spiders,
her lap is full of moss.

50:11.141 --> 50:12.335
It's said she sees things.

50:12.409 --> 50:14.741
Well the crazy do see things.

50:16.913 --> 50:20.815
I never begged anyone to come here
and take on our fight.

50:21.184 --> 50:22.811
I don't hold you here...

50:23.353 --> 50:23.944
I know you don't.

50:24.087 --> 50:25.679
Then don't saddle my heart
with the talk of

50:25.822 --> 50:29.155
why a fucking troll does
what fucking troll does.

51:01.424 --> 51:03.085
Ahhhhh!!!!!

51:03.226 --> 51:05.160
Ahhhhhhhhh!!!!
Ahhhhhhhhh!!!!

51:05.295 --> 51:06.990
Watch the sides!

51:15.572 --> 51:17.472
Cone on crab slime,

51:19.309 --> 51:21.243
show me these teeth.

52:04.220 --> 52:09.624
O'er the night, the warriors waited,
sword and shield in ring wrapped grasp.

52:09.759 --> 52:14.560
Then the fiend of bog and brine reached
those doors of ten mers weight,

52:14.698 --> 52:21.433
...bade it creak by breath alone.
But then smelt God amongst the men.

52:21.638 --> 52:25.199
Hardly had they hoisted steel,
this thing's rank guts gave out.

52:25.342 --> 52:27.708
Great Beowulf, God's awful arm... -

52:27.656 --> 52:31.956
Enough! Go on, go off kids.

52:32.294 --> 52:33.818
Go on, go off!!

52:38.667 --> 52:40.191
You scare them doing that.

52:40.369 --> 52:42.030
O fuck, Thorkel.

52:42.237 --> 52:44.933
They've only had months of waking
to the scattered parts of kin!

52:45.073 --> 52:46.836
Don't feed them lies.

52:48.310 --> 52:52.406
That was piss the other night -
piss on us.

52:52.981 --> 52:56.178
If any gods were around there,
they were sleeping.

52:56.318 --> 53:01.346
Celt says that Jesus Christ
never sleeps, that he walks amongst us.

53:01.757 --> 53:07.457
Oh, that's all we need.
A god gone mad from lack of sleep.

53:17.839 --> 53:19.204
Enough!

53:26.081 --> 53:27.742
He's already fighting like that Dane.

53:29.451 --> 53:34.388
You want to waste your strokes
on me and the air - go ahead.

53:38.527 --> 53:40.154
Hondscioh had a bad dream.

53:49.204 --> 53:50.671
And yours were good?

53:53.041 --> 53:55.601
Here with the smoke of the dead?

53:57.679 --> 53:59.977
I don't see fear helping us.

54:19.835 --> 54:21.132
Watch you don't drop that.

54:22.137 --> 54:23.832
Fear has it's place.

54:52.000 --> 54:53.968
I wondered if you threw the bones.

54:55.904 --> 54:58.168
I need the right path.

54:58.540 --> 55:00.440
There is the one
that leads back to Geatland.

55:01.143 --> 55:02.735
If the bones say so.

55:06.114 --> 55:07.342
What if I lie?

55:11.153 --> 55:12.950
Then the gods will bring me back.

55:16.058 --> 55:18.083
So. No thoughts at all for my cunt.

55:21.897 --> 55:27.199
Warrior-monk huh,
there's not many of those.

56:48.116 --> 56:49.447
Troll!

56:49.684 --> 56:53.916
Leave here...
or stay and meet your doom!

56:54.055 --> 56:59.550
Doom... doom...
doom doom doom doom doom doom doom

56:59.694 --> 57:00.490
Is that talk?

57:00.629 --> 57:02.756
It isn't barking

57:09.704 --> 57:10.363
What?

57:10.505 --> 57:13.167
You're not Dane,
that's why you still breathe.

57:13.942 --> 57:16.638
I'm blood-bound to Hrothgar!

57:16.778 --> 57:20.976
Blood, blood, blood,
blood... owhhhhooohha

57:21.116 --> 57:22.777
He says that's your burden.

57:23.318 --> 57:24.410
My burden...

57:24.553 --> 57:27.249
...is your stinking life!

57:31.193 --> 57:32.717
Come down here,

57:32.794 --> 57:37.128
I swear I'll hammer these stones
right up your hairy arse!

57:37.265 --> 57:39.290
Garble

57:47.509 --> 57:49.238
Why won't he fight me?

57:49.845 --> 57:53.246
Why should he?
You've done nothing to him.

57:59.955 --> 58:02.014
What was he doing at your hut?

58:02.290 --> 58:07.091
I forgot. You're the great Geat -
welcome to women wherever you go.

58:07.462 --> 58:08.258
Swimmer of oceans...

58:08.396 --> 58:10.762
able to kill five Swedes
with one stroke of his great blade...

58:10.899 --> 58:14.062
We came to help the Danes find peace.

58:14.169 --> 58:20.369
I'm Dane. I'm at peace.
Not that I always was.

58:20.809 --> 58:23.505
When Alvis Three-Legs died in my bed,
some claimed I killed him.

58:23.645 --> 58:26.341
So they drove me to the wilds.

58:26.481 --> 58:29.279
Then they'd only come around to
maybe spill some seed.

58:30.585 --> 58:32.177
Not since Grendel.

58:33.288 --> 58:34.687
Grendel?

58:35.657 --> 58:37.215
Your troll.

58:38.260 --> 58:43.027
Weirdly enough he has a name.
It means grinder.

58:44.666 --> 58:45.997
Of bones.

58:46.501 --> 58:48.935
No, of teeth.

58:49.638 --> 58:56.635
He was born with bad dreams.
Nothing I say will help you kill him.

59:14.262 --> 59:16.162
As long as the king wins the day.

59:16.298 --> 59:17.663
Always, my lord.

59:22.470 --> 59:27.840
Another bloodless dawn.
For you at any rate.

59:32.414 --> 59:33.711
I'm pissing it.

59:34.649 --> 59:35.843
Blood?

59:37.519 --> 59:39.749
It's cone and gone over
the last few months.

59:40.989 --> 59:45.119
I'm turning into a woman.
Or a dying man.

59:50.799 --> 59:55.168
I spoke with him last night. Grendel.

59:56.271 --> 59:57.431
You talked?

59:58.039 --> 01:00:00.803
If you can believe what Selma says.

01:00:01.543 --> 01:00:07.140
He was above me in the rocks.
But he spoke, words.

01:00:08.817 --> 01:00:11.786
He only wants Danes.
He blames you for something.

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.217
Oh he blames me!

01:00:15.857 --> 01:00:17.381
He blames me!

01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:20.260
Of all the shit he blames me!

01:00:21.663 --> 01:00:24.188
There's coves north of here
no Dane even dares to go!

01:00:24.332 --> 01:00:26.459
How much land does one mouth need?

01:00:26.635 --> 01:00:29.365
What does he think he is
some sort of fucking troll Caesar -

01:00:29.504 --> 01:00:31.734
with rights to everything he looks upon?

01:00:34.442 --> 01:00:42.213
Beowulf, the word
on the waves is I die happy.

01:00:43.685 --> 01:00:46.017
No gods I've ever know has
offered me that.

01:00:46.154 --> 01:00:48.884
They promised me beer,
fish here and there...

01:00:49.024 --> 01:00:50.651
and friends to burn.

01:00:57.132 --> 01:01:00.101
It's hard to hold you spoke
to that thing.

01:01:00.568 --> 01:01:02.331
From well beyond my sword.

01:01:07.142 --> 01:01:08.803
Something has you turning.

01:01:09.978 --> 01:01:12.572
I fear he just waits for us to go.

01:01:14.382 --> 01:01:16.577
Same thought gnaws on me.

01:01:33.001 --> 01:01:35.435
Now Celt bless me or be done.

01:01:41.876 --> 01:01:47.212
Go in peace my lord, go in peace.
Wise king go in peace.

01:01:51.119 --> 01:01:56.955
That's it my lord, praise the Lord.
Praise him.

01:01:58.359 --> 01:02:01.419
Go with the thorn of Christ, wise King.

01:02:18.913 --> 01:02:21.507
Grimur's got a troll-heart!
He brought the troll here!

01:02:21.649 --> 01:02:23.583
I'm a Dane and a Christian!

01:02:23.718 --> 01:02:25.242
And your mother screwed trolls!

01:02:25.487 --> 01:02:27.011
You little prick! You!

01:02:31.593 --> 01:02:33.322
The Troll killed my brothers.

01:02:34.696 --> 01:02:38.826
But this wretch didn't
but we'll get the one who did.

01:02:40.068 --> 01:02:42.901
Now on you go. All of you, go on!

01:02:46.741 --> 01:02:51.269
I can lead you to
the Dane-killer's cave.

01:02:57.685 --> 01:02:59.175
Why didn't you before?

01:02:59.254 --> 01:03:13.100
Ahh... I feared it's wrath, my death.
No more. No more.

01:03:25.747 --> 01:03:27.214
Over there.

01:03:58.346 --> 01:03:59.540
Great.

01:03:59.614 --> 01:04:01.081
So who jumps first?

01:04:01.349 --> 01:04:02.316
It'ss...

01:04:02.450 --> 01:04:04.645
a-a short climb down.

01:04:08.223 --> 01:04:10.088
Our scabby friend's right.

01:04:10.258 --> 01:04:11.691
I can see the hole.

01:04:11.926 --> 01:04:12.984
Give us a hand.

01:04:38.786 --> 01:04:40.219
I-I swear - by

01:04:40.355 --> 01:04:41.322
Christ.

01:04:41.322 --> 01:04:43.119
Let's leave Christ out of this.

01:04:48.997 --> 01:04:50.225
We need a rope.

01:04:50.331 --> 01:04:53.732
- I'll rope ya.
- Might not be a bad idea.

01:04:55.103 --> 01:04:58.163
Hey troll - have some of ours!

01:05:32.473 --> 01:05:34.873
...so they came to
the cave of the killer.

01:05:35.777 --> 01:05:44.378
Wrecked by rush and slime of slope
Hondscioh fair fell to Valhalla

01:05:44.552 --> 01:05:46.577
Let's uh let this sad tale sleep.

01:05:47.288 --> 01:05:51.384
Hondscioh shows up -
great Odin asks how he died.

01:05:52.193 --> 01:05:53.353
He says -

01:05:53.528 --> 01:05:55.018
- I... fell?

01:06:04.472 --> 01:06:05.871
Breca!

01:06:05.974 --> 01:06:07.703
Breca!

01:06:31.499 --> 01:06:34.434
Even the trolls love my wonderful hair.

01:06:34.569 --> 01:06:36.264
I think he wanted you
for more than that.

01:06:36.404 --> 01:06:39.339
Great Breca, the Troll-house Pisser!

01:06:39.674 --> 01:06:42.507
I'd be more careful
where I wave my spear.

01:06:42.777 --> 01:06:45.109
I'd piss in his mouth
if he dared to show it.

01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:48.407
Best be ready to do more than that.

01:08:29.517 --> 01:08:30.881
Beowulf

01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:53.366
Look!

01:08:54.575 --> 01:08:58.136
Our friend Grendel doesn't come
from mist and shit alone.

01:09:01.716 --> 01:09:05.117
I curse you and all your kin.

01:09:50.965 --> 01:09:52.296
He wasrt in his cave.

01:09:53.533 --> 01:09:54.933
How does he die?

01:09:56.604 --> 01:09:58.401
Unless your teeth can catch an axe.

01:10:01.809 --> 01:10:04.107
I led my men into this... not knowing.

01:10:04.946 --> 01:10:07.005
If I'd known, I'd've come alone.

01:10:08.382 --> 01:10:10.282
Now I see doom hanging
over some of them.

01:10:10.418 --> 01:10:12.147
Doom I brought.

01:10:15.022 --> 01:10:16.319
You found the cave.

01:10:19.260 --> 01:10:20.852
That's where I see him dying.

01:10:21.562 --> 01:10:22.256
Would you wait in your cave

01:10:22.396 --> 01:10:24.591
and for killers who knew
the path to your door?

01:10:29.804 --> 01:10:31.101
Take me to Grendel.

01:10:31.606 --> 01:10:34.404
What, you think I can sniff him down?

01:10:34.742 --> 01:10:37.506
Maybe not, but he can sniff you.

01:10:55.196 --> 01:10:56.390
Which way up from here?

01:10:56.464 --> 01:10:58.091
Straight... but you'd need claws.

01:10:58.332 --> 01:10:59.697
Then again, heroes... -

01:11:03.638 --> 01:11:05.333
You hit me, I'll be the one -

01:11:08.743 --> 01:11:10.074
One to what?

01:11:11.012 --> 01:11:16.245
I can't stop his death from coming...
nor can I hurry it.

01:11:17.351 --> 01:11:21.378
He needs to know...
I know he was wronged.

01:11:21.555 --> 01:11:24.388
But if he doesn't leave here
I can't stop...

01:11:24.458 --> 01:11:26.255
You're warning him.

01:11:39.307 --> 01:11:43.710
Careful which side you end up on.
You're a long way from the village.

01:11:44.745 --> 01:11:46.474
You're a longer way from home.

01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:47.392
Wake up men,

01:13:47.535 --> 01:13:48.866
or never again!

01:14:04.852 --> 01:14:07.184
By Christ, demon, you shall die!

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.759
Pappa

01:17:20.247 --> 01:17:22.272
Now you truly know our loss.

01:17:26.186 --> 01:17:28.245
You only told us half the tale.

01:17:30.391 --> 01:17:32.859
The other half would dull your sword.

01:17:35.129 --> 01:17:39.930
That troll didn't give a shit about us,
not till we wronged him.

01:17:40.868 --> 01:17:44.736
He killed one, ah,
he could've killed more.

01:17:46.974 --> 01:17:49.067
He killed the one he held in blame.

01:17:50.477 --> 01:17:53.071
Were it so easy... l'd have been the one.

01:17:55.749 --> 01:17:57.376
I killed his father.

01:17:59.586 --> 01:18:01.349
And even that might have been an end

01:18:01.588 --> 01:18:03.681
...had it only been the father there...

01:18:16.870 --> 01:18:17.996
None of the others saw the child.

01:18:18.138 --> 01:18:21.130
But I could've quelled it there
and then...

01:18:21.642 --> 01:18:23.303
but weakness stopped my sword.

01:18:29.616 --> 01:18:30.583
Or kindness.

01:18:30.718 --> 01:18:33.243
Well then
it's the hardest kindness I know.

01:18:33.787 --> 01:18:36.415
All the gods are running away
from me now -

01:18:37.024 --> 01:18:39.219
as though I were the death itself.

01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:50.828
What had the father done to you?
Why did you kill him?

01:18:52.906 --> 01:18:54.396
He crossed our path.

01:18:57.277 --> 01:18:58.767
Took a fish.

01:19:29.877 --> 01:19:31.105
Without an arm...

01:19:31.245 --> 01:19:32.644
Unless it grows back.

01:19:34.615 --> 01:19:35.912
He's a troll

01:19:40.387 --> 01:19:44.050
Tell me, Thorfinn. What is a troll?

01:19:44.625 --> 01:19:47.958
They say there are lizards
that can grow back limbs.

01:19:49.263 --> 01:19:52.164
They say there are worms
that can grow back heads.

01:19:54.034 --> 01:19:57.003
This thing's no more worm than you or I.

01:19:59.573 --> 01:20:03.339
Yahhhh!

01:20:03.477 --> 01:20:06.878
Yahhhh!

01:20:07.014 --> 01:20:12.213
Yahhhh!

01:20:15.789 --> 01:20:20.590
You know, I've put my thing in other
mers wives, other mers daughters...

01:20:20.727 --> 01:20:22.718
All can be forgiven

01:20:23.263 --> 01:20:24.787
I slept with a witch -

01:20:25.232 --> 01:20:26.790
You slept with a witch?

01:20:28.769 --> 01:20:30.327
That's gotta be bad.

01:20:31.104 --> 01:20:33.698
I put my thing in her.
That was a while back... -

01:20:34.174 --> 01:20:36.233
So long as you vow to change your ways.

01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:41.373
Oh, y'know I'll try, right, but... ahhh.

01:20:44.318 --> 01:20:46.878
Ya! Ya!

01:20:51.725 --> 01:20:56.788
Ya! Ya! Ya!

01:20:59.066 --> 01:21:01.557
Where's the arm ring?
I wanted that arm-ring.

01:21:01.702 --> 01:21:02.669
He didn't have an arm-ring.

01:21:02.803 --> 01:21:05.539
Sure he did.
Listen the creep near snapped my neck.

01:21:05.539 --> 01:21:07.769
Figured I'd at least get the arm-ring.

01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:11.572
To the end of gloom!

01:21:11.645 --> 01:21:13.545
To the end of Gloom!

01:21:14.448 --> 01:21:15.676
To the end of Gloom.

01:21:24.491 --> 01:21:26.425
I don't think I'm the worst king...

01:21:27.461 --> 01:21:28.519
Not at all... -

01:21:28.629 --> 01:21:30.153
...when I think of the others.

01:21:31.798 --> 01:21:35.602
Martin Longsword has got a long sword,
but no brains.

01:21:35.602 --> 01:21:37.729
Half his kin ran off to Angle-land.

01:21:38.238 --> 01:21:43.437
Six-tooth Peter the Slav can't keep
his warriors from fighting each other.

01:21:45.846 --> 01:21:47.245
Then... there's Sig!

01:21:47.981 --> 01:21:48.470
Sig?

01:21:48.615 --> 01:21:54.247
Sig Skullsplitter of the Hathboards.
Havert you heard of Sig?!

01:21:54.655 --> 01:21:57.852
I don't know... something... with sheep?

01:21:57.991 --> 01:22:02.257
Sheep! Good God, man!
Sheep are just the tip of it.

01:22:02.396 --> 01:22:04.626
They say he tried it once
with a dead walrus...

01:22:04.765 --> 01:22:07.461
he's tried horses... he's,
he's tried goats.

01:22:07.601 --> 01:22:10.798
They say he tried it once with a,
with a rabbit... and got stuck...

01:22:10.938 --> 01:22:12.098
Stuck?!

01:22:12.372 --> 01:22:13.703
I tell ya, when he comes to a fight,

01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:17.003
he comes with six legs...
and you want to see fast?!

01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:21.909
If he ever comes here,

01:22:22.015 --> 01:22:24.142
I'll just send out
a batch of squirrels!

01:22:24.284 --> 01:22:25.808
That'll stop him!

01:22:44.805 --> 01:22:50.266
It's over now. It's over.
The troll's dead.

01:22:52.879 --> 01:22:54.278
Come on now dear.

01:22:54.348 --> 01:22:55.838
Let's lie down a bit.

01:22:56.116 --> 01:22:58.243
There'll be many more nights now
to drink.

01:23:21.375 --> 01:23:23.605
Is this more or less as you saw it?

01:23:24.644 --> 01:23:25.906
With the troll?

01:23:27.381 --> 01:23:29.474
I saw you more bloodied.

01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:34.878
Luck stood at my side.

01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:38.187
Luck can be a whore too.

01:23:40.260 --> 01:23:41.625
Arert you missing the meal?

01:23:42.829 --> 01:23:44.626
Guess I miss my friend more.

01:23:46.366 --> 01:23:47.560
Hondscioh.

01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:54.804
And one Geat's life won'th - what?
Huh?

01:23:55.342 --> 01:24:01.110
Two Danes...? Three Swedes...?
Ten trolls...?

01:24:04.051 --> 01:24:07.350
Hondscioh's life had won'th to you,
since you knew him.

01:24:09.556 --> 01:24:11.581
Others know others.

01:24:16.630 --> 01:24:18.530
You mourn the troll.

01:24:20.667 --> 01:24:21.827
I knew him.

01:24:26.706 --> 01:24:29.504
One night Grendel found my hut.

01:26:12.846 --> 01:26:14.507
He never took me again.

01:26:20.654 --> 01:26:23.054
So why did he keep coming back?

01:26:24.090 --> 01:26:25.785
Keep the Danes away.

01:26:28.261 --> 01:26:31.025
The ones who'd fuck me
and then cut my throat.

01:26:55.488 --> 01:26:57.353
Where...
Where did that have it's birth.

01:26:57.490 --> 01:27:00.550
You thinking you can tie me up
and drag me like a dog.

01:27:02.696 --> 01:27:04.425
Don't forget.

01:27:07.033 --> 01:27:08.625
I know how you die.

01:27:21.214 --> 01:27:22.340
Been a while?

01:27:22.849 --> 01:27:25.784
With men... yeah.

01:27:52.312 --> 01:27:56.078
He slept with a witch.
Who sleeps with a witch?

01:27:56.983 --> 01:28:00.783
I'm tellnya, Christ y'thought
the Celts were work but these

01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:03.889
it's one hand on their sword,
the other on their dick...

01:28:04.024 --> 01:28:05.685
which hand they'll
use to cross themselves,

01:28:05.825 --> 01:28:07.690
I almost fear to ask...

01:28:39.959 --> 01:28:42.086
Learn from your child, hag!

01:29:34.948 --> 01:29:39.408
Aeschere! Aeschere!

01:29:49.496 --> 01:29:50.690
It's Aeschere.

01:29:56.169 --> 01:30:00.469
Aeschere! We will right this wrong!

01:30:00.607 --> 01:30:03.474
God will burn this devil-bitch-fiend!

01:30:36.075 --> 01:30:37.702
Nothing lives here.

01:30:51.291 --> 01:30:54.920
Cave doesn't end here.
There's outflow from the other side

01:30:56.095 --> 01:30:57.323
I'll go.

01:30:59.098 --> 01:31:00.497
You can't swim for shit.

01:32:16.910 --> 01:32:19.435
Ahhhhhhh!!!!

01:32:21.147 --> 01:32:22.637
Ahhhhhhh!!!!

01:34:01.114 --> 01:34:02.411
Your father.

01:34:19.332 --> 01:34:20.890
Then be proud.

01:34:54.233 --> 01:34:57.134
Valkyries will have their hands full
with that old goat.

01:35:02.275 --> 01:35:04.106
I'm sorry to have brought you
to all this.

01:35:06.079 --> 01:35:07.478
We brought ourselves.

01:35:08.414 --> 01:35:09.881
At least it's over.

01:35:12.452 --> 01:35:19.688
The Celtic priest said I'd be forgiven.
I just need to hook the right god.

01:35:21.060 --> 01:35:24.996
You ever worry about that? Heaven?

01:35:27.834 --> 01:35:30.428
I'm thinking I'll likely go
where I'm sent.

01:36:09.342 --> 01:36:11.776
You know they'll kill your son
if they find him.

01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:15.508
You couldn't.

01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:28.650
I'm not them.

01:36:32.198 --> 01:36:36.658
No. You just killed his father.

01:36:42.041 --> 01:36:44.100
Hrothgar taught you nothing then.

01:37:44.604 --> 01:37:46.731
Sleep, Grendel.

01:38:17.670 --> 01:38:25.236
...born of scum and swampy things
lurking in his mother's moss

01:38:26.612 --> 01:38:35.782
the mark of Cain came to his brow,
of evil and a sea-hag born,

01:38:36.689 --> 01:38:43.026
Grendel, grinder of lost mers bones.
Felt hated toward the happy Danes.

01:38:43.162 --> 01:38:45.494
Cain... what's that?

01:38:45.798 --> 01:38:48.790
Man who killed his brother
in a Christian tale.

01:38:48.935 --> 01:38:53.634
What's Cain got to do with Grendel?
Grendel kill his own brother too?

01:38:53.839 --> 01:38:58.936
No, I think Thorkel's saying
that Grendel's like Cain - a Killer.

01:38:59.078 --> 01:39:00.238
We all are.

01:39:00.313 --> 01:39:01.041
Ya, well

01:39:01.180 --> 01:39:02.909
Thorkel's tale is shit.

01:39:43.456 --> 01:39:48.086
- By Odirs will...
...let us find our way home.
